Moving Forward from a New Starting Point
—A Bird's-Eye View of Industrial Production in Democratic Germany—

    Basic Contradictions

    "The war brought serious losses," "The division has destroyed the integrity of the economy"—we could hear such statements everywhere when we visited the leading cadres or ordinary workers of enterprises in the German Democratic Republic.

    Although the end of the war and the formation of the division have been more than ten years ago, the material and spiritual outlook of the German Democratic Republic has undergone fundamental changes. However, these topics are still very fresh today. This is because it not only shows the broad German people's resentment of the war, and it is not only that the marks of war and division can still be seen in many cities and factories today; but more importantly, to correctly evaluate the great achievements of the industrial recovery and construction of Democratic Germany, it is necessary to first study these two factors.

    The biggest loss brought by the war was the severe destruction of many cities and factories. In Dresden, Deputy Mayor Dietrich showed us a huge photo full of ruins and rubble. This was a tragedy that occurred after the Yalta Conference in 1945 had already decided the fate of Germany. In order to prevent Dresden's industry from falling into the hands of the approaching Soviet army and the German people facing liberation, the American and British imperialists dispatched thousands of aircraft on the third and fourth days after the Yalta Conference and fiercely bombed 80% of the buildings in this beautiful ancient city with a history of more than 750 years. Even today, people can still see broken walls and ruins in this city.

    Another destruction brought by the war occurred during the period of American occupation: in the huge Berren coal, electricity, and chemical joint enterprise, the American army destroyed all the equipment for synthetic gasoline. In the famous Agfa film and artificial fiber factory, the American army stole all the precision instruments and technicians. In the Zeiss optical instrument factory, the first in the world to manufacture microscope lenses, the American army stole all the important design documents and encouraged the Zeiss directors to open a small factory in West Germany with the same brand name to compete with Jena Zeiss....

    According to statistics, the loss of industrial productivity in Democratic Germany due to war damage and post-war dismantling was about 50%.

    As for the difficulties caused by the division, it is even more difficult for many people to imagine. It is enough to cite such a figure to give a general idea. According to the pre-war distribution of industry, the machinery manufacturing industry in the current Democratic Germany region accounts for about 30% of the pre-war German machinery manufacturing industry, while the output of coal and steel accounts for only about 6%. This situation of large machine processing capacity and few raw materials is still the main reason for the imbalance in industrial production in Democratic Germany today.

    The first result of this contradiction is that it is necessary to import a large amount of raw materials to maintain industrial production. For example: in 1957, the demand for hard coal was 9,173,000 tons, of which 6,350,000 tons needed to be imported; the demand for metallurgical coking coal was 2,436,000 tons, of which 1,700,000 tons needed to be imported; the demand for non-metallurgical coking coal was 2,694,000 tons, of which 690,000 tons needed to be imported. And to import, it is necessary to export. In addition, Democratic Germany's grain, meat, fats, vegetables and fruits cannot be self-sufficient, and all need to be exchanged for exported industrial products. According to rough statistics, about 30% to 40% of the industrial output value of Democratic Germany is for export. This brings about the second result: about 60% of the original enterprises in Democratic Germany have not been able to update their machines after the war.

    In order to heal the wounds of the war and overcome the difficulties after the division, the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and the government of Democratic Germany have for several years unyieldingly carried out different difficult tasks at the same time: actively establishing an industrial raw material base; restoring production and enabling it to accumulate quickly; vigorously improving and raising the people's living standards, so that it reaches and exceeds the original—also the highest living standards in Europe. All this has been basically achieved in the first five-year plan.

    Overcoming Difficulties

    Today, twelve years after the war, we are visiting this great brotherly country. What we see is that this country has stood tall under the oppression of numerous difficulties and is marching towards socialist goals with great strides.

    In order to meet the needs of industrial raw materials, many new industrial enterprises have been established. Stalin City—a new city formed around a steel joint enterprise—appeared on the map for the first time. This is a huge enterprise that can produce 3,200 tons of steel every day (currently, Democratic Germany produces 1.5 million tons of pig iron, 2.86 million tons of steel ingots, and 2.2 million tons of steel). The production of lignite has also increased from 130 million tons in 1950 to 205 million tons in 1956. The artificial fiber industry, which supplies the textile industry, is also developing by leaps and bounds. By 1960, the annual output of artificial fiber in Democratic Germany will reach a level of more than 15,000 tons....

    The great achievements of industrial construction in Democratic Germany are also reflected in its overcoming the special and difficult natural conditions. Here, we still use coal as an example: the output of hard coal in Democratic Germany is only more than 1.8 million tons per year, and industrial and civil coal mainly rely on lignite. The so-called lignite does not have the shape of a block that we generally imagine, nor does it have the glittering black color. To put it vividly, it is just some loose brown soil blocks. The lignite seam is not deep and the distribution area is very wide, and most of it is open-pit mining. Therefore, in order to mine lignite, many fields and houses have to be destroyed.

    We visited a Berren open-pit coal mine about 20 kilometers south of Leipzig. The mining method of this coal mine is completely different from Fushun and Fuxin mines in our country. It does not mine downwards and around after stripping the topsoil, but advances in a line within a width of one and a half kilometers. Therefore, the coal mining surface is constantly pushing towards the city of Leipzig. An engineer who led the way told us with some worry: in another forty years, we will have to dig to the suburbs of Leipzig. At that time, you can stand on the roof of the Astoria Hotel and visit our work.

    The mined lignite also needs to undergo a complex processing process. The moisture content of lignite accounts for 57%—60%, and the heat is only 2,000 calories. To be used as fuel, it needs to be processed by machine to make coal briquettes, so that the moisture content is reduced to 10% and the heat is increased to 4,000 calories. On average, 2.9 tons of lignite are required to manufacture such a ton of coal briquettes. If you want to refine it into metallurgical coke, you still need to continue processing the coal briquettes. The Lauhammer large coking plant in the Cottbus Special Zone of Democratic Germany is currently the only factory in the world that uses lignite to make coke. This factory only started production in 1951. It uses a specially made blast furnace to heat the coal briquettes for 20 hours, and finally turns them into coke. On average, 1.6 tons of coal briquettes are required to produce one ton of coke. That is to say, one ton of coke requires 4.5 tons of lignite.

    Another factor promoting the industrial development of Democratic Germany is the rapid and effective restoration of old factories. Under the conditions of severe damage and little increase in machines, the German comrades overcame various difficulties and restored production in many old factories and greatly exceeded the historical highest level.

    Here, we can take the Leuna factory as an example. Leuna was originally an enterprise of Faben Company. Its current products include artificial fertilizers, pesticides, plastic semi-finished products, paint contact agents, synthetic gasoline, etc., a total of 375 kinds. 80% of the equipment in this factory was destroyed at the end of the war, and 200 of the 400 senior technicians ran to West Germany. Among the remaining personnel, there were also individual bad elements. Three days before we visited this factory, the deputy director of the factory, Sandorf, had just been dismissed for reactionary remarks.

    However, these difficulties have been overcome one by one. They used the method of dismantling the east to make up for the west to restart many machines. We visited the gas compression workshop. There were nine sets of machines there, but now they have been put together into seven sets, and some machines still have patches on them. They also united the original old workers and tried their best to train a large number of young technicians. As a result, this factory had already reached a balance of payments in 1950, and currently many outputs have exceeded the level of 1936, and one-fourth of its products are exported to China and Egypt. Bruck Franz, secretary of the Halle District Party Committee, told me: Now Western countries no longer say that we cannot restore Leuna. They have had to confirm the development of our cause, envy it and dream of taking away this important factory again. For this purpose, in the stock market in West Germany, they even started to sell stocks of the Leuna factory that they do not have equity and shares in.

    Lofty Goals

    By 1956, the industrial production of Democratic Germany had reached 218.6% of the level of 1936. At present, it is moving forward from a new starting point. According to the spirit of the second five-year plan, it is necessary to continue to develop the national economy, surpass West Germany in production, and reach the world level in technology.

    In order to achieve this lofty goal, the leading comrades of the economic departments, the technicians of the enterprises, and the broad masses of workers in Democratic Germany are working with amazing efforts. On the one hand, they actively increase the production of industrial raw materials—especially coal and plastics; on the other hand, they are vigorously improving machinery and equipment and researching new technologies.

    The main problem in coal production at present is to increase the stripping workload of existing open-pit mines and accelerate the construction of new coal mine bases. The situation that stripping cannot keep up with coal mining already existed during the first five-year plan. In five years, the speed of coal mining increased by 51%, while the speed of stripping only increased by 36.4%. At present, the stripped area of ​​30 open-pit mines is only enough for one or two months of mining (only one-third of the average in 1951), and the output of these 30 mines accounts for one-half of the national output. In order to change this situation, the investment in the production of mining machinery has been greatly strengthened in this year's national plan. It is planned that from this year to 1960, the state will newly add 140 large mining machines.

    Another source of increasing industrial raw materials is the extensive use of plastic products. Longovich, Minister of Industry of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, told us: "Plastics can no longer be called substitutes in industry. It is a new and extremely valuable raw material." He said: In most cases, drainage pipes used in construction have been replaced with plastic products; plastic is also better than steel for bearings on machines; the P-70 cars produced in Democratic Germany are all made of plastic shells, and the cushions are also made of plastic products; as for daily necessities, plastic leather bags are difficult to distinguish from real leather or fake leather, and other products such as tablecloths, clothing, socks, etc. The products of Democratic Germany have a good reputation in the European market.

    As for the innovation of production technology, there are of course also many difficulties. The main reason is that the production of certain machines used for domestic use is insufficient. We once visited the largest Rostock Warnow Shipyard in Democratic Germany. The hull manufacturing capacity of this factory is very large, but the supply of machines is insufficient. The comrades of the Party Committee told us: If we can get enough machines, we can build six more 10,000-ton ocean freighters every year. This situation cannot but affect the increase in production speed to a certain extent. Although many enterprise leaders told us that all their machines will be replaced during the second five-year plan, the main thing for the country as a whole is to make the most of the existing equipment and rely on the wisdom of the broad masses of workers to continuously improve the operating methods. According to the materials provided by Longovich, workers put forward more than 270,000 rationalization proposals in 1955, increasing the production value of 250 million marks, and there were more rationalization proposals in 1956, and the total value of increased production reached 360 million marks.

    Another aspect of technological innovation is improving product design. From 1955 to 1956, more than 300 new machine tools, measuring tools and instruments were invented, and many of the products received a lot of praise at the Leipzig Fair. In order to understand the development of new technologies, we visited an atomic reactor under construction and a jet passenger aircraft design office. This is the result of the cooperation between engineering technicians in Democratic Germany and Soviet experts. The jet passenger aircraft that Democratic Germany is about to produce is similar to the Tu-104 in terms of speed, range, and passenger capacity, but it has some other characteristics: four jet cylinders are installed in two groups on a lever under the wing, which can not only reduce the noise in the aircraft, but also facilitate replacement at any time; at the same time, due to the better coordination of the fuselage and the power unit, it is also more economical in terms of fuel consumption.

    We visited sixteen factories in Democratic Germany and talked with many economic leaders. We deeply admire the working enthusiasm and creative wisdom of the German working class. We sincerely congratulate them on their ever-changing achievements in developing the socialist economy.

    从新的基点上迈步前进
    ——民主德国工业生产情况鸟瞰——
    王揖
    基本矛盾
    “战争带来了严重的损失”，“分裂破坏了经济的整体”——在我们访问德意志民主共和国的企业领导干部或普通工人的时候，到处都可以听到他们这样的申述。
    尽管战争的结束和分裂局面的形成都已十多年了，德意志民主共和国的物质的和精神的面貌已经发生了根本的改变。但是这些话题今天仍然是十分新鲜的。因为它不仅显示了广大德国人民对战争的愤恨，也不仅在很多城市和工厂中今天还可以看到战争和分裂的烙印；而更重要的是，要正确地评价民主德国工业恢复和建设的巨大成就，必需首先研究这两个因素。
    战争带来的最大的损失，是很多城市和工厂被严重破坏。在德累斯登，副市长迪特里希给我们展示了一副满纸残垣碎瓦的巨大照片。这是1945年雅尔塔会议上已经决定了德国的命运以后发生的悲剧。美英帝国主义分子为了不让德累斯登的工业落入日益逼近的苏军和面临着解放的德国人民手中，在雅尔塔会议后的第三天和第四天，出动了成千架飞机，狠命地炸毁了这个有着七百五十多年历史的美丽古城的80％的建筑物。一直到今天，人们在这个城市里还可以看到断垣残壁。
    战争带来的另一种破坏，是在美军一度占领期间发生的：在巨大的贝伦煤、电、化学联合企业里，美军把人造汽油的全部装置炸毁了。在著名的矮克发胶片和人造纤维工厂里，美军劫走了所有的精密仪器和技术人员。在世界上第一个制造显微镜头的蔡司光学仪器厂里，美军偷走了所有的重要设计文件，并且鼓励蔡司的董事们在西德开设了一个同一产品牌号的小小的工厂来和耶那蔡司抗衡……。
    根据统计，民主德国工业生产力因为战争破坏和战后拆卸的损失，约为50％左右。
    至于分裂所造成的困难，更是很多人难于想像的。只需举出这样一个数字，就可见一般。根据战前工业分布的情况，现今民主德国地区的机器制造业，约占战前全德的30％，而煤和钢铁的产量，只占6％左右。这种机器加工能力大而原料少的情况，一直到今天还是民主德国工业生产不平衡的主要原因。
    这个矛盾带来的第一个结果，就是必需大量进口原材料来维持工业生产。例如：1957年需用硬煤九百一十七万三千吨，其中要进口六百三十五万吨，需用冶金焦煤二百四十三万六千吨，要进口一百七十万吨；需用非冶金焦煤二百六十九万四千吨，要进口六十九万吨。而要进口，就必需要出口。加之民主德国的粮食、肉类、油脂、菜蔬和水果都不能自给，也都需要用出口工业品去换取。根据粗略的统计，民主德国的工业产值中，约有30％至40％是供输出的。这就带来了第二个结果：民主德国原有的企业中，战后约有60％的机器不能更新。
    为了医治战争的创伤和克服分裂后的困难，德国统一社会党中央和民主德国政府几年来坚毅不屈地在同一个时间内执行着不同的困难的任务：积极建立工业原料基地；恢复生产并使之很快地能有所积累；大力改善和提高人民生活，使之达到和超过原有的——也是欧洲最高的生活水平。这一切，在第一个五年计划中已经基本上实现了。
    战胜困难
    在战后十二年的今天，我们访问这个伟大的兄弟国家，我们看到的是这个国家已经从重重困难的压迫下巍然地站立起来了，并以巨大的步伐走向社会主义目标。
    为了满足工业原料的需要，很多新的工业企业建立起来了。斯大林城——一个以钢铁联合企业为中心而形成的新的城市——第一次出现在地图上了。这是一个每天可产三千二百吨钢的巨大的企业（目前民主德国年产生铁一百五十万吨，钢锭二百八十六万吨，钢材二百二十万吨）。褐煤的生产，也从1950年的一亿三千万吨提高到1956年的二亿零五百万吨。供应纺织工业使用的人造纤维工业也正在突飞猛进地发展着，到1960年，民主德国人造纤维的年产量将达到了一万五千多吨的水平……。
    民主德国工业建设的巨大成就，还表现在它战胜特殊困难的自然条件方面。这里还是用煤来作例子：民主德国的硬煤产量每年仅一百八十多万吨，工业和民用煤主要靠褐煤。所谓褐煤，它根本没有我们一般人所想像的那种成块的形状，更没有闪闪发光的黑黝黝的颜色，说得形象一点，那只是一些松松散散的褐色的土块。褐煤的煤层不深而分布的面很广，多是露天采掘。因此，为了开采褐煤，就得翻山倒海地毁掉许多田地和房屋。
    我们参观了莱比锡城南约二十公里的一个贝伦露天煤矿。这个煤矿的开采方法同我国抚顺和阜新矿完全不同，它不是在剥离了表土后就向下和向四周开采，而是在一个一公里半的宽度内一线推进。因此，掘煤面不断地推向莱比锡城市。一个带路的工程师不无忧愁地告诉我们：再等四十年，我们就要掘到莱比锡城郊了。那时，你们站在奥斯特里亚旅舍的房顶上，就可以参观我们的工作了。
    采掘的褐煤，还需要经过复杂的加工过程。褐煤的水份占57％—60％，热量仅二千卡里罗。要用作燃料，就需要经过机器加工造成煤砖，使水份减到10％，热量增至四千卡。平均制造这样的一吨煤砖，需要褐煤二点九吨。如果要炼成冶金用的焦煤，还需要继续将煤砖加工。民主德国东部科特布斯专区的劳哈马大型炼焦厂，就是目前世界上唯一的用褐煤炼焦的工厂。这个工厂1951年才开始生产。它用一种特制的高炉，使煤砖经过二十小时的加热处理，最后变成焦煤。生产一吨焦煤，平均需要一点六吨煤砖。这也就是说，一吨焦煤需要四点五吨褐煤。
    推动民主德国工业发展的另一个因素，是迅速和有效地恢复旧厂。德国同志们在破坏严重和机器增加很少的条件下，克服了种种困难，使很多旧的工厂恢复了生产并且大大超过了历史的最高水平。
    这里可以举出劳伊纳工厂为例。劳伊纳原先是法本公司的一个企业。它目前的产品包括人造肥料、农药、塑料半成品、油漆接触剂、人造汽油等共三百七十五种。这个工厂的设备在战争结束时有80％都被破毁了，四百个高级技术人员中有两百个跑到了西德。剩下的人员中，也还有个别的坏分子。我们参观这个工厂的前三天，该厂的副厂长桑道尔夫还刚刚因为反动言行而被解职。
    但是，这些困难都被一一克服了。他们曾用拆东补西的办法，使很多机器重新开动了。我们参观的煤气压缩车间，那儿原有九组机器，现在拼成了七组，若干机器上还打着补锭。他们还团结了原有的老工人和尽力培养了一大批青年的技术人员。结果，这个工厂在1950年就已经达到了收支平衡，目前很多产量都超过了1936年的水平，其中四分之一的产品远销中国和埃及。哈雷专区党委书记布鲁克·佛兰茨告诉我：现在西方国家不再说我们不能恢复劳伊纳了，他们已经不得不确信我们事业的发展，羡慕并且梦想再次夺去这个重要的工厂。为了这个目的，在西德的股票市场上，甚至开始出售他们并无股权和股分的劳伊纳工厂的股票了。
    崇高目标
    民主德国的工业生产，到1956年为止，已经达到1936年水平的218.6％。目前它正从一个新的基点上迈步向前。根据第二个五年计划的精神，必须继续发展国民经济，在生产上超过西德，在技术上达到世界水平。
    为了实现这个崇高的目标，民主德国经济部门的领导同志、企业的技术人员和广大的工人群众，正以惊人的努力工作着。他们一方面积极增加工业原料——特别是煤和塑料的生产；另一方面是大力改进机器设备和研究新的技术。
    煤炭生产当前的主要问题，是提高现有露天矿的剥离工作量和加速新的煤矿基地的建设。剥离赶不上煤炭采掘的情况，在第一个五年计划期间就已经存在。在五年中，挖煤的速度提高了51％，而剥离速度只提高了36.4％。目前，有三十个露天矿，剥离了的面积，仅够一、二个月的开采（只及1951年平均数的三分之一），而这三十个矿的产量，相当全国产量的二分之一。为了转变这一情况，在今年国家计划中，已经大大加强了生产采掘机械的投资，计划从今年起到1960年止，国家将新增加一百四十个大型的采掘机。
    增加工业原料的另一个来源，是广泛地运用塑料制品。统一社会党中央工业部长隆哥维奇告诉我们：“塑料在工业上已经不能叫作代用品了，它是一个新的极其珍贵的原料。”他说：在大多数的情况下，建筑中用的排水管已经改用塑料产品了；机器上的轴承，塑料也比钢材为佳；民主德国生产的P—70汽车，外壳全部用塑料，坐垫也用塑料产品；至于日用品中，塑料皮包很难区别它是真皮或者假皮，其它如枱布、衣料、袜子等等，民主德国的产品在欧洲市场上都有着良好的声誉。
    至于生产技术的革新，当然也同样有着很多困难。主要是供应本国使用的某些机器的生产不足。我们曾经参观了民主德国最大的罗斯托克瓦诺夫造船厂，这个工厂的船身制造能力很大，但是机器供应不足。党委会的同志告诉我们：如果能得到足够的机器，每年可以多造六只一万吨的远洋货轮。这种情况，就不能不在一定程度上影响生产速度的增长。虽然有不少的企业领导同志告诉我们，在第二个五年计划过程中，他们的机器将全部更换，可是从全国来说，主要的仍然是要尽量利用现有设备，并且依靠广大工人群众的智慧不断改进操作方法。根据隆哥维奇提供的材料，1955年工人共提出了二十七万多项合理化建议，增产了价值二亿五千马克的产品，1956年的合理化建议更多了，增产总值达到了三亿六千马克。
    技术革新的另一方面是改进产品设计。1955年到1956年，新发明了三百多种工作母机、量具和仪器，其中不少的产品在莱比锡展览会上得到了很多的好评。为了了解新的技术的发展，我们参观了一个正在建筑中的原子反应堆和一个喷气式客机设计处。这是民主德国工程技术人员和苏联专家合作的结晶。民主德国即将生产的喷气式客机，在速度、航程、乘客容量各方面同图一一○四都差不多，但它却具备了另一些特点：四个喷气筒，分两组装在机翼之下的一个杠杆之上，既可以减轻机内的噪声，也便于随时更换；同时，由于机体和动力装置的协调较好，在消耗燃料方面也更经济一些。
    我们参观了十六个民主德国的工厂，同很多经济领导工作者谈过话。我们深深赞佩德国工人阶级的劳动热情和创造性的智慧。我们衷心地祝贺他们在发展社会主义经济的工作中取得日新月异的成就。
