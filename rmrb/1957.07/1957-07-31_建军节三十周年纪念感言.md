Reflections on the 30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Army
Dong Qiwu, General of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    As we approach the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the people of the whole country are joyfully and enthusiastically celebrating this glorious festival. This is because the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the people's own army, and its birth marks the victorious development of the Chinese people's liberation cause and the beginning of a happy life for the people. The Chinese People's Liberation Army and its predecessor, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, since their birth, under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the firm support of the people of the whole country, have undergone decades of arduous struggle, developing and growing into a powerful armed force that wholeheartedly serves the people. It not only defeated the aggression of Japanese militarism, but also overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in China, liberating 600 million people from long-term brutal oppression and exploitation. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Liberation Army assumed the sacred mission of defending the security of the motherland's national defense, defending the socialist construction of the motherland, and defending peace in the Far East and the world. The People's Liberation Army is the defender of the people's happy life. The masses affectionately call it the people's own army, so whenever the Army Day arrives, the masses celebrate with enthusiasm, as if it were their own happy festival.
    Since entering the door of revolution in 1949, I have been responsible for military work due to the Party's cultivation and trust. In the past eight years of practical work, I have deeply realized the loveliness of the people's army and the inevitability of its victory, and thus I often think back to the hatefulness of the reactionary army and the inevitability of its failure. I am a person who served as a commander in the old army for many years. At that time, in my personal subjective desire, I thought I was working for the people and the country, but in essence, I became a tool for protecting the powerful, landlords, and the bourgeoisie to oppress and exploit the broad masses of working people. Therefore, this kind of army was bound to be opposed and hated by the people. In the old army, they also said verbally that officers and soldiers were united, but in essence, officers became the oppressors of the broad masses of soldiers. For example, saying "unreasonable demands, absolute obedience," there was no respect for the personality of soldiers at all, and soldiers were often beaten, scolded, and humiliated. Soldiers, awed by authority, had no choice but to obey on the surface. Therefore, whether in peacetime duty or wartime operations, they would reluctantly move only under the supervision of officers, and perfunctorily perform their duties when out of supervision. Even among officers, there was often a superficial harmony and each harbored his own ulterior motives. There was no unity in peacetime and no coordination in wartime. How could an army like this, which was opposed by the people, with officers and soldiers in opposition, and officers with superficial harmony, win battles? It was even more impossible to shoulder the important task of protecting the country and defending the people, so the failure of the reactionary army was inevitable, and the victory of the people's army was also inevitable.
    The People's Liberation Army is an army with a high degree of political consciousness under the leadership and education of the Party. Every member of the army knows that they are for the interests of the people and belong to the people. Therefore, whether in peacetime duty or wartime combat missions, they are conscious, selfless, not afraid of any difficulties, not avoiding any danger, and vying to accept the most arduous and glorious tasks. This kind of army is an invincible and all-conquering army. Its specific manifestations are: the class love and close unity between officers and soldiers, with cadres loving soldiers and soldiers respecting cadres. Everyone is united for a common goal—building a socialist society. Therefore, political democracy, economic democracy, and military democracy are also implemented in the army. Because of the full promotion of democracy, every commander and fighter can give full play to his enthusiasm and creativity, thereby ensuring the completion of any arduous task. In terms of the relationship between the army and the people, officers and soldiers understand that they are the people's army, and the people regard officers and soldiers as their own children. Therefore, the army respects and cherishes the people everywhere, and the people help and cherish the army in everything. There is a flesh-and-blood connection between the people and the army. In fact, the army is the flesh and blood of the working people, as close as fish and water. In peacetime, the people automatically supply the army with everything it needs for food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and often inquire about their well-being, as close as family members. In wartime, the people automatically scout out the enemy's situation for the army, provide information, carry the wounded, transport ammunition, deliver tea and meals, and help the army eliminate the enemy. In terms of the relationship between the military and the government, military cadres are mainly responsible for military training in peacetime, and mainly responsible for commanding operations in wartime; political work cadres are mainly responsible for political education and ideological leadership in peacetime, so that the broad masses of commanders and fighters understand the Party's policies and guidelines in various periods and constantly improve their political awareness, and mobilize commanders and fighters to ensure the completion of combat missions in wartime. Military and political cadres have a division of labor, but at the same time, they cooperate closely and work together to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party. Therefore, political cadres can also lead training in peacetime and command operations in wartime, and military cadres can also lead political education in peacetime and mobilize commanders and fighters to ensure the completion of tasks in wartime. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army is an army that has both military knowledge and skills and a high degree of political consciousness. The minds of the broad masses of commanders and fighters are always clear, their eyes are always sharp, and their fighting spirit is always high. In terms of army discipline, every commander and fighter understands the spirit of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. The observance of discipline is not forced, but conscious. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army is loved and welcomed by the people wherever it goes. Just like our Chinese People's Volunteers went to Korea, they were also loved and welcomed by the Korean people. This kind of army with unity between officers and soldiers, unity between the military and the government, and unity between the military and the people is a completely new type of army in the world, and it is an invincible army forever.
    The thirty-year history of the People's Liberation Army, from nothing to something, from small to large, from a single service to a joint service, is also the development history of the Chinese people's liberation cause. This is a glorious epic. The revolutionary pioneers, for the permanent happiness of the people, went through all the difficulties and obstacles in the world, and relentlessly and heroically fought resolutely and persistently against the reactionary ruling forces to achieve the complete victory of the Chinese revolution. This revolutionary fighting spirit of selfless devotion and eternal loyalty to the people is the glorious tradition of our Liberation Army, and we must continue to maintain and carry it forward.
    I am honored to be a member of the People's Liberation Army. When we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of our army, I sincerely thank the correct leadership of our great Chinese Communist Party, and thank Chairman Mao, the organizer and creator of the People's Liberation Army, for his cultivation and education of us. I must, under the leadership of the Party, work diligently and honestly to study hard, constantly improve my political awareness and military technology, unite with comrades, work actively, maintain and carry forward the fine traditions of our army, and contribute everything to the defense of the motherland's national defense security and the socialist construction of the motherland, and to the defense of peace in Asia and the world, together with all the commanders and fighters of the army.
    While we are happily celebrating the festival, do not forget that the US imperialists are still occupying our territory of Taiwan, and regardless of the will of the people of the world, they are stubbornly expanding their arms and preparing for war, building military bases everywhere, and relying on their equipment advantages, they vainly attempt to subvert our people's democratic regime, so that the reactionary ruling class can be restored in the mainland and oppress the people again. We solemnly warn the US imperialists: the awakened Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have the determination, confidence, and strength to completely destroy and annihilate any enemy who dares to launch aggression.

    建军节三十周年纪念感言
    中国人民解放军上将　董其武
    当中国人民解放军建军三十周年纪念到来的时候，全国人民都在兴高采烈、欢欣鼓舞地来庆祝这个光荣的节日。这是因为中国人民解放军是人民自己的军队，他的诞生正是标志着中国人民解放事业的胜利发展，标志着人民幸福生活的开端。中国人民解放军和他的前身——中国工农红军，自诞生之日起，就在中国共产党的领导、教养下，在全国人民的坚决支持下，经过几十年的艰苦奋斗，发展、壮大成为一支全心全意为人民服务的强大的武装力量，不但打败了日本军国主义的侵略，而且打倒了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的反动统治，把六亿人民从长期的残酷压迫和剥削下解放出来。中华人民共和国成立后，人民解放军就担负起保卫祖国国防安全、保卫祖国社会主义建设、保卫远东与世界和平的神圣任务。人民解放军是人民幸福生活的捍卫者，群众亲切地称他为人民的子弟兵，所以每逢解放军建军节到来时，群众就如同过自己的幸福节日一样，表示热烈的庆祝。
    我自1949年进入革命大门以来，由于党的培养和信任，一直担负着军事工作。八年来在实际工作中，深深体会到人民军队的可爱和他的胜利是必然的，因而也就常常回想到反动军队的可恨和他的失败也是必然的。我是过去在旧军队中作过多年指挥官的人，当时在个人主观愿望上还以为是为人民、为国家，而实质上成为保护豪门、地主和资产阶级压迫剥削广大劳动人民的工具，因而这种军队必然遭到人民的反对和憎恨。在旧军队中，口头上也说什么官兵一致，而实质上军官成为对广大兵士的压迫者，如说什么“无理要求，绝对服从”，根本谈不到尊重士兵的人格，并动辄对士兵打骂凌辱，士兵慑于威权，才不得不表面上服从。因而无论平时服勤务或战时作战，在军官监视之下就勉强动一动，脱离监视就敷衍了事。即军官与军官之间，也多是貌合神离，各怀鬼胎，平时谈不到团结，战时谈不到协同。像这样遭到人民反对、官兵对立、军官之间貌合神离的军队，怎样能打胜仗呢？更谈不到担当保国卫民的大责重任，所以反动军队的失败是必然的，而人民军队的胜利也是必然的。
    人民解放军是在党的领导教育下，有着高度政治觉悟的军队，军队中的每个成员都知道他们是为了人民利益的，是属于人民的，所以无论平时执行勤务或战时执行战斗任务，都是自觉的，忘我的，不怕任何困难，不避任何危险，争先恐后地接受最艰巨而光荣的任务，这样的军队是战无不胜、攻无不克、无敌于天下的军队。他的具体表现是：官兵之间是阶级友爱，亲密团结的，干部爱护士兵，士兵尊敬干部。大家都是为了一个共同的目标——建设社会主义社会而团结起来的，所以在军队中也同样是实行政治民主、经济民主、军事民主，由于充分发扬民主，使每个指战员都能发挥他的积极性和创造性，从而保证了完成任何艰巨的任务。表现在军民之间的关系上，官兵懂得自己是人民的军队，人民把官兵看作是自己的子弟，因而军队处处尊敬人民，爱护人民，人民事事帮助军队，爱护军队，人民与军队有着血肉般的联系，而实际上，军队就是劳动人民的血肉结合起来的，就如同鱼和水一样的亲密。在平时，人民自动地供应军队衣食住行所需要的一切，并经常问寒问暖，亲如家人，战时人民自动地为军队侦察敌情，通风报讯，抬伤员，运子弹，送茶饭，帮助军队消灭敌人。表现在军政关系上，军事干部平时主要是负军事训练责任，战时主要是负指挥作战的责任；政治工作干部平时主要是负政治教育和思想领导的责任，使广大的指战员了解各个时期党的方针政策，不断地提高他们的政治觉悟，战时动员指战员保证完成战斗任务。军事和政治干部有分工，同时又密切配合，共同为完成党所交付的光荣任务而努力。所以政治干部平时也可以领导训练，战时也可以指挥作战，军事干部平时也可领导政治教育，战时也可以动员指战员保证完成任务。所以人民解放军是既具有军事知识技能，又具有高度的政治觉悟的军队。广大的指战员同志头脑经常是清醒的，眼睛经常是雪亮的，战志经常是旺盛的。表现在军队纪律上，每个指战员都了解三大纪律、八项注意的精神，对纪律的遵守不是强迫的，而是自觉的。所以人民解放军无论到任何地方，都受到人民的爱护和欢迎。就如我们中国人民志愿军到朝鲜，也同样受到朝鲜人民的爱护和欢迎。这种官兵团结、军政团结、军民团结的军队，是世界上完全新型的军队，是永远不可战胜的军队。
    人民解放军三十年来，由无到有，由小到大，由单一兵种到联合兵种的发展历史，也就是中国人民解放事业的发展历史。这是一篇光荣的史诗。革命的先驱者们为了人民的永久幸福，历尽了人间的艰难险阻，百折不挠地、英勇顽强地与万恶的反动统治势力持久地坚决斗争，才取得中国革命的完全胜利，这种奋身忘我、永远忠实于人民的革命战斗精神是我们解放军的光荣传统，我们一定要继续保持并发扬光大。
    我荣幸的身为人民解放军的一个成员，当我军建军节三十周年纪念的时候，衷心地感谢我们伟大的中国共产党的正确领导，感谢人民解放军的组织者和创造者毛主席对我们的培养和教育。我一定要在党的领导下，勤勤恳恳、老老实实地努力学习，不断提高自己的政治觉悟和军事技术，团结同志，积极工作，保持和发扬我军的优良传统，和全军指战员一道，为保卫祖国国防安全和祖国社会主义建设、为保卫亚洲与世界和平贡献自己的一切。
    在我们欢度庆祝节日的同时，不要忘记美帝国主义者还霸占我们领土台湾，并不顾世界人民的意志，一意孤行地扩军备战，到处建设军事基地，凭借装备优势，妄想颠覆我人民民主政权，使反动统治阶级在大陆上复辟，重新压迫人民。我们严正地警告美帝国主义者：觉悟了的中国人民和中国人民解放军，对任何敢于发动侵略的任何敌人，都有决心、有信心和有力量给以彻底的摧毁和歼灭。
