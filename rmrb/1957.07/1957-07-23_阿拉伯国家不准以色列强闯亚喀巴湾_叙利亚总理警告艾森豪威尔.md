Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 22nd: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on July 21st that Arab countries would unanimously respond to any attempt by Israel to forcibly pass through the Gulf of Aqaba.

Al-Assali told the press: "The Gulf of Aqaba has always been and should continue to be Arab territorial waters, and the Arabs will maintain this right no matter what sacrifices they have to make."

Al-Assali made these remarks when commenting on a speech by U.S. President Eisenhower. According to Western newspapers, Eisenhower recently said that the Gulf of Aqaba is an international waterway and that Israel has the right to free passage.

Prime Minister al-Assali said: "The Gulf of Aqaba is the main waterway for Muslims from all over the world to make their annual pilgrimage to Mecca, so all Arab countries support Egypt and Saudi Arabia in prohibiting Israeli navigation."

He also said: "The current movement by imperialist countries to internationalize the Gulf of Aqaba violates international law and historical facts."

    阿拉伯国家不准以色列强闯亚喀巴湾
    叙利亚总理警告艾森豪威尔
    新华社22日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利7月21日说，对于以色列的任何强行通过亚喀巴湾的企图，阿拉伯国家将一致给予回击。
    阿萨利对报界说：“亚喀巴湾一直是并且应当继续是阿拉伯的领水，阿拉伯人无论付出多大的牺牲都要保持这个权利。”
    阿萨利是在评论美国总统艾森豪威尔的谈话时这样说的。据西方报纸报道，艾森豪威尔最近说亚喀巴湾是国际水道，以色列有权自由通行。
    阿萨利总理说：“亚喀巴湾是世界各地的穆斯林每年一度去麦加朝觐的主要水路，因此所有阿拉伯国家都支持埃及和沙特阿拉伯不准以色列航行。”
    他还说：“目前帝国主义国家企图把亚喀巴湾国际化的运动，是违反国际法和历史事实的。”
