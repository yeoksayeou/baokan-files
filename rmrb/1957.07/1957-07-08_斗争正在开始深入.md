Title: The Struggle is Beginning to Deepen

The struggle of the Chinese people against the bourgeois right-wingers is now beginning to develop in depth. The marks of the beginning of in-depth development are: the awareness of the broad masses of workers, peasants, young students, revolutionary intellectuals, and industrialists and businessmen who support socialism has greatly increased, and they have actively plunged into the struggle against the right-wingers; the democratic parties, universities, and organs have successively launched serious criticisms and exposures of the right-wingers in their respective units; the right-wingers have fallen into passivity and isolation, and many strongholds of the right-wingers have begun to be broken through. The most important command organ of the right-wingers in the country, the Zhang-Luo alliance, has begun to expose its inside story under the encirclement and suppression from all sides. In the journalistic field, the Luo Longji-Pu Xixiu-Wenhui Daily editorial department, a right-wing system of the China Democratic League, has also been unable to hide its secrets.

As the struggle began to deepen, and as the true face of the right-wingers was further exposed, many people who originally did not believe that there were any right-wingers, or did not think it was necessary to oppose the right-wingers, have gradually changed their attitudes after being greatly surprised. They began to realize that right-wingers do exist, that they are indeed carrying out activities against the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and that they are indeed a hidden danger to the people's cause. The people's state is consolidated, but the reason why it is consolidated is, of course, not because it turns a blind eye to antagonistic activities, but because it constantly maintains vigilance against these activities. In order to raise the vigilance of the broad masses, in order to raise the revolutionary consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, it is not enough to rely solely on positive education, but also on negative education. The anti-socialist words and deeds of the right-wingers are the best vivid negative teaching materials for the broad masses.

But the struggle has only just begun to deepen. The right-wingers' conspiracy has not yet been fully exposed. The systematic rebuttal of the right-wing fallacies has only just begun. Precisely because of this, some people in an intermediate state are still skeptical about the struggle against the right-wingers and are still holding a wait-and-see attitude. They are calculating in their minds: "To know what will happen next, let's listen to the next chapter." Some people even think: Is this because the Communist Party cannot stand criticism and does not want to rectify the style of work anymore, so it has shifted its target? In order to convince these people, it is necessary to completely expose the conspiracy of the right-wingers and completely refute the fallacies of the right-wingers. And to achieve this goal, the struggle must continue to deepen.

In order to make the struggle continue to deepen, it is now necessary to prevent two tendencies.

One tendency is a sentimentalism towards right-wingers. People who hold this tendency try their best to forgive right-wingers, describe right-wingers as middle-of-the-roaders, describe their erroneous words and deeds as accidental oversights, rhetorical exaggerations, being used by others, etc., are unwilling to draw a clear line between themselves and them, and even more unwilling to wage a resolute struggle against them. This tendency obviously hinders the development of the anti-rightist struggle and hinders the improvement of mass awareness. Sentimentalists are afraid of hurting the right-wingers, but why do they not see how the right-wingers' words and deeds have hurt the people's cause? Why are they so affectionate towards the right-wingers, but so indifferent to the people's cause? Moreover, we have already said that, except for those who repeatedly commit mistakes and continue to carry out destructive activities and violate criminal law, the principles of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient and transforming negative factors into positive factors are still applicable to general right-wingers. Therefore, the current anti-rightist struggle is not only completely necessary for the people's socialist cause, but also an opportunity for general right-wingers to correct their mistakes and turn over a new leaf. The sentimentalist's position of fostering evil is completely wrong from any point of view.

Another tendency is to adopt a hasty and crude attitude towards the guidance of the struggle, hoping to use simple methods to "fight a quick battle to achieve a quick decision." The struggle against the right-wingers requires a full exposure and thorough criticism of the right-wingers. Criticism requires relying on analytical, convincing, and refutable reasoning, and exposure requires relying on solid, verifiable facts. In order to explain that the current anti-socialist words and deeds of certain right-wingers are not accidental, but have certain historical roots, it is educational to trace some of their past facts, but the focus of exposure should still be on the present. In short, haste and crudeness, and simple work, cannot solve the problem. Some units do not allow those who have made mistakes to defend themselves or retain their opinions, do not point out a way out for those who have made mistakes, or lightly make organizational decisions on those who have made mistakes, and these methods are not conducive to the deepening of the struggle. The deepening of the struggle certainly takes time. The struggle will form different paragraphs according to the shift of focus, and there will be some intervals between these paragraphs. Haste makes waste, and one should be especially not be impatient on issues of an ideological nature. We should be prepared to spend the necessary time, and we should not underestimate the complexity and difficulty of the struggle, be satisfied with superficial temporary effects, and hastily withdraw troops. In the process of the struggle, we must be resolute and courageous, but also conduct serious investigations and research, strictly distinguish between right and wrong, and adopt correct methods of reasoning, and avoid all avoidable errors. Only in this way can we truly achieve the goal of uniting and educating the vast majority and defeating a small number of right-wingers.

### 斗争正在开始深入

    斗争正在开始深入
    我国人民群众反击资产阶级右派分子的斗争，现在正在开始向深入发展。开始深入的标志是：广大的工人、农民、青年学生、革命的知识分子、拥护社会主义的工商业者的觉悟大大提高了，积极地投入了反对右派的斗争；各民主党派、各高等学校、各机关对本单位的右派分子，陆续地展开了严肃的批判和揭露；右派分子已经陷入被动和孤立，右派的许多堡垒已经开始被攻破。右派在全国范围内最重要的指挥机关章罗联盟，在各方面的围攻之下，内幕已经开始暴露。在新闻界方面，罗隆基—浦熙修—文汇报编辑部这样一个民盟右派系统，也已经无法掩藏自己的秘密了。
    由于斗争开始深入，由于右派的真面目进一步暴露，许多原来不相信有什么右派、或者不认为反对右派有什么必要的人们，现在在大吃一惊之后，也逐渐改变态度了。他们开始认识到，右派确实存在，确实在进行着反对社会主义革命、反对社会主义建设的活动，确实是人民事业的心腹之患。人民的国家是巩固的，但是它之所以巩固，当然不是因为它对于敌对性的活动熟视无睹，而是因为它经常对于这些活动保持警惕。为了提高广大群众的警惕，为了提高广大群众的革命觉悟和革命积极性，单单依靠正面的教育是不够的，还必须依靠反面的教育。右派分子的反对社会主义的言行，对于广大群众就是最好的活生生的反面的教材。
    但是斗争还只是开始深入。右派的阴谋还远没有完全揭穿。对于右派谬论的有系统的反驳，也还只是在开始进行。正因为这样，有一部分处在中间状态的人们，对于反对右派的斗争还在将信将疑，还在抱着观望态度。他们在心里盘算着：欲知后事如何，且听下回分解。有一些人甚至以为：这是不是共产党受不了批评，不想再整风了，因而转移了目标呢？为了说服这些人，必须完全揭穿右派的阴谋，完全驳倒右派的谬论。而要达到这个目的，就必须使斗争继续深入下去。
    为了使斗争继续深入，现在需要防止两种倾向。
    一种倾向是对于右派分子的温情主义。抱着这种倾向的人竭力原谅右派分子，把右派分子描写成为中间分子，把他们的错误的言论行动描写成为偶然的疏忽、修辞上的夸张、被人利用等等，不愿意同他们分清界限，更不愿意对他们进行坚决的斗争。这种倾向显然妨碍着反右派斗争的发展，妨碍着群众觉悟的提高。温情主义者生怕伤害了右派，但是他们为什么不看到，右派分子的言论行动是怎样地伤害了人民的事业呢？为什么他们对于右派分子那样多情，对于人民的事业却这样寡情呢？而且，我们已经说过，除了屡犯不改，继续进行破坏活动，触犯刑律的以外，对于一般右派分子，惩前毖后，治病救人，化消极因素为积极因素，这些原则还是适用的。因此，目前的反右派斗争对于人民的社会主义事业固然完全必要，就是对于一般右派分子说来，也是他们痛改前非、洗心革面的一个机会。温情主义者的养癕贻患的立场，无论从哪一方面说来，都是完全错误的。
    另一种倾向是对斗争的指导采取急躁粗暴的态度，希图用简单的方法“速战速决”。反对右派的斗争要求对于右派进行充分的揭露和彻底的批判。批判需要依靠有分析的、有说服力的、经得起反驳的说理，揭露需要依靠确凿的、经得起检查的事实。为了说明某些右派分子目前的反社会主义的言行并非出于偶然，而是有一定的历史根源，追溯他们的过去的若干事实是有教育意义的，但是揭露的重点仍然应该着重在目前。总之，急躁粗暴，简单从事，是不能解决问题的。有些单位，不让犯错误的人进行答辩或者保留自己的意见，不给犯错误的人指明出路，或者对犯错误的人轻率地作出组织上的处理，这些办法都不利于斗争的深入。斗争的深入当然需要时间。斗争将依重点的转移形成不同的段落，在这些段落之间还会要有一些间歇。欲速则不达，在思想性质的问题上特别不能急躁。我们应该准备付出必要的时间，而不应该过低地估计斗争的复杂性艰苦性，满足于表面的暂时的效果，草率收兵。在斗争的过程中，既要坚决勇敢，又要认真调查研究，严格分清是非轻重，采取正确的说理的方法，避免一切可以避免的错误。只有这样，才能够真正达到团结和教育最大多数而击败少数右派分子的目的。
