    I have a treasure,
    I don't love brilliant gold and jade,
    I don't love glittering jewels;
    The most precious treasure in my heart,
    Is this rusty, mottled little knife.
    Ten years ago, the owner of this knife and I
    Fought together fiercely on Yimeng Mountain,
    Unfortunately, we were separated from the troops and surrounded by the enemy,
    We ran out of bullets and finished our rations.
    In a dark and frigid mountain cave,
    We hid from the enemy's search,
    But, even more ferocious enemies were disease, hunger, and the blizzards of the twelfth lunar month.
    My comrade held me, unconscious, in his arms all night;
    During the day, he used this knife to dig up vegetable roots,
    Crawling through the death-filled mountains.
    One day he said to me: "You are too weak,
    I must go down the mountain to find some food,
    We can't let hunger twist our throats,
    And breaking through also requires enough strength."
    In the gloomy dusk, rapid gunfire sounded,
    My heart was shattered and I staggered out of the cave,
    Calling out my comrade's name in a broken voice,
    Answering me was only the mournful howling wind.
    He left this little knife beside me,
    For ten years, it has never been separated from me—
    I want to cherish it forever,
    So that future generations will also understand what friendship in battle is.

### 我有一件珍宝

    我有一件珍宝
    黎汝清
    不爱灿烂的金玉，
    不爱晶莹的珠宝；
    我心上最高贵的珍品，
    是这把锈痕斑驳的小刀。
    十年前，我和这把小刀的主人
    一同激战在沂蒙山上，
    不幸脱离了部队陷入敌人重围，
    打光了子弹，用尽了干粮。
    在阴暗而僵冷的山洞里，
    我们躲避着敌人的搜索，
    但，更凶恶的敌人却是疾病、饥饿和腊月的暴风雪。
    我的战友整夜地把昏迷不醒的我抱在怀中；
    白天他便用这把小刀挖掘菜根，
    在布满死亡的山野爬行。
    这一天他对我说：“你太虚弱了，
    我要到山下找一点食粮，
    不能让饥饿扭断我们的咽喉，
    而且突围也需要足够的力量。”
    阴沉的黄昏里传来急骤的枪声，
    我的心被击碎了踉跄着走出山洞，
    失声地呼唤着战友的名字，
    回答我的只是凄厉的狂风。
    在我身边他遗留下这把小刀，
    十年来，它不曾和我分离——
    我要把它永远珍藏，
    让子孙也懂得什么是战斗中的友谊。
