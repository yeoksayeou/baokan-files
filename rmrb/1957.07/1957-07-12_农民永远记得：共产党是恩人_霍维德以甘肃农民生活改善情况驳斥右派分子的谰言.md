Farmers Will Always Remember: The Communist Party is Their Benefactor
Huo Weide Refutes Slanders of Rightists with Evidence of Improved Living Conditions for Gansu Farmers

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the various reports of the Congress. I propose that the Congress approve these reports and mobilize the people of the whole country to actively strive for the complete fulfillment of the 1957 National Plan. Now, regarding the question of whether the lives of farmers have improved, I would like to share some personal views based on the situation in Gansu.

Before Liberation, Gansu Farmers Lived Worse Than Animals; Now Their Enthusiasm for Production is High

As everyone knows, before liberation, due to the cruel oppression and exploitation by landlords, bureaucrats, and warlords, Gansu was extremely backward in terms of economy and culture, and the lives of all ethnic groups were extremely impoverished, especially the vast number of working farmers, who were unable to eat enough or wear warm clothes, living lives like animals. At that time, teenage girls had no pants to wear, five or six family members shared a single felt mat, and a cotton-padded coat had to be worn for ten years or more. There was simply not enough food to eat, and every year there would be four or five months or even half a year of eating bran and wild herbs. Such situations were everywhere, numbering in the millions! After liberation, through a series of social movements such as rent reduction, anti-hegemony, land reform, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, productive forces were liberated. Especially after the spring of 1956, over 97% of farm households joined advanced agricultural cooperatives, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production soared to unprecedented heights, greatly improving labor efficiency. Men and women threw themselves into production movements such as building water conservancy projects, conserving water and soil, processing land, accumulating fertilizer and weeding, eliminating the four pests, and fully utilizing favorable weather conditions. Last year alone, more than 4.36 million mu of irrigated land were newly built, equivalent to 120.8% of the area of irrigated land developed in the six years from 1950 to 1955, and equivalent to 72.3% of the area of irrigated land built in the more than two thousand years before liberation. In 1956, the entire province achieved a bumper harvest, with total grain output reaching 10.9 billion jin, an increase of 150% compared to 1949, and an increase of 2.63 billion jin compared to the actual output in 1955, exceeding the highest annual output before liberation by 73%.

Due to the rapid increase in agricultural production, farmers' incomes have also continued to increase. According to statistics from 1956, the total value of agricultural and sideline production in the province was more than 1.36 billion yuan, an increase of more than 100% compared to 1950. After deducting public grain, production costs, public accumulation, and management fees, the average income per person was around 75 yuan. The Zhuangziping Agricultural Cooperative in Gaolan County, which used to suffer from famine almost every year, still had more than 90% of households lacking grain in 1955, with a shortage of more than 1 million jin. In 1956, due to the great increase in farmers' production enthusiasm after agricultural cooperation and the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects, coupled with favorable weather conditions, an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved. The average net distribution of grain per member was 650 jin. The cooperative had a total surplus of 1.39 million jin. Among the 906 member households, the income of 408 households was enough to eat for a year and a half, the income of 333 households was enough to eat for two years, and the income of 89 households was enough to eat for more than three years. Not a single household lacked grain.

Due to the rapid increase in agricultural production and the continuous increase in farmers' incomes, farmers' purchasing power has also increased significantly. According to statistics, the average purchasing power per person was only 6 yuan in 1950, but increased to 45 yuan in 1956, an increase of 650%. Why has it grown so fast? There are four reasons: (1) The level of purchasing power of Gansu farmers before liberation was particularly low, averaging less than 6 yuan per person; (2) Gansu has a large number of livestock products, medicinal materials, and other local specialties. After liberation, production has developed, there are sales channels, and prices are reasonable, thus greatly increasing farmers' incomes; (3) The rapid development of industrial and agricultural construction and urban construction has created more avenues for farmers to engage in sideline occupations, such as transportation, odd jobs, and weaving mountain goods, resulting in substantial income; (4) Gansu has a vast land area with great potential. Land that used to yield no harvest year after year can produce 200 to 300 jin as long as it is irrigated, so agricultural income increases quickly.

Farmers' Lives are Gradually Improving, and Purchasing Power is Increasing Year by Year

The rapid increase in farmers' purchasing power also means that farmers' lives are gradually improving. For example, in the Renhua Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Dingxi County, among the 160 old members, 42 households had no land and no houses before land reform, 70 households sold their labor all year round, and 110 households were short of grain all year round, relying on borrowing high-interest loans or working short-term jobs for landlords and rich peasants to make a living. The phenomenon of having nothing to wear or cover was even more common. In one village, 51 households had only 6 quilts and 2 felt mats. By 1956, the average distribution of grain per person in the whole cooperative was 1,851 jin, and the proportion of households with surplus grain reached over 84%. Not a single household lacked grain. The number of quilts increased to 698, averaging more than 2 per household. Song Delu, a middle peasant in this cooperative, has a family of six: a couple and four children. Before liberation, they mainly relied on selling their labor to make a living. After liberation, their lives gradually improved. In 1953, the whole family had only one tattered quilt and were short of grain for three months; in 1954, the whole family wore winter clothes, but were short of grain for only one month; in 1955, they became a surplus grain household, selling 700 jin of surplus grain, not only wearing new clothes but also sewing a new quilt; in 1956, they sold 2,000 jin of surplus grain, bought a leather coat, and the whole family had three seasons of clothes to change, and also bought a quilt and a sheet each. Two children were also sent to school. In addition to the above, since liberation, the state has also provided loans of more than 136.9 million yuan to rural areas, and distributed various relief funds of more than 26.2 million yuan. The two items together average about 75 yuan per household. Now, the phenomenon of teenage girls having no pants to wear has been completely eliminated, and the phenomenon of five or six family members sharing a single felt mat is no longer seen at all. Farmers' needs for culture, hygiene, transportation, and other daily necessities are increasing day by day. Up to now, in addition to the primary schools run by the state, agricultural cooperatives have established 3,437 primary schools, with 165,577 students, accounting for 17.76% of the total number of school-age children in the province; agricultural cooperatives have established 1,857 health stations (rooms); farmers have built more than 8,400 kilometers of simple roads; many agricultural cooperatives have telephones, radios, or loudspeakers; every agricultural cooperative has literacy classes or night schools. Farmers' demand for daily necessities such as cotton cloth, salt, tobacco, wine, and sugar has also greatly increased. Taking cotton cloth as an example, the sales volume in the province in 1950 was 955,662 bolts, but increased to 4,534,304 bolts in 1956, an increase of 3.7 times. The sales volume of printed cloth in 1956 increased by 61.4% compared to 1955. Thermos bottles have become a common utensil in rural areas. Sneakers and bicycles have also become best-selling goods in rural areas. Farmers' meat consumption has also greatly increased compared to the past. According to my own understanding of the situation in nine agricultural cooperatives this year, during the Spring Festival last year, almost every household slaughtered a pig, and most of them were kept entirely for their own consumption. Who can say that farmers' lives have not improved since liberation? Who can say that the Party and the government do not care about farmers? Why don't the rightists take off their black glasses and look at reality?

Farmers Have Problems and Opinions, But They Can Be Resolved Through Criticism and Self-Criticism and Improving Work

With the increase in farmers' income and the increase in purchasing power, new problems have also arisen. The farmers' new reluctance to sell is one of the problems. For example, the amount of live pigs, sheepskins, and wool used by farmers themselves has greatly increased, but the amount sold has grown very slowly, resulting in a situation where the country needs them, the farmers do not sell them, the rural areas are stockpiled, and the cities are out of stock. This is the contradiction between the state, the collective, and the individual. To solve this contradiction, in addition to constantly strengthening publicity and education to farmers, the state must implement policies of unified purchase and sales and control the purchase and supply of major products related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, such as grain, cotton cloth, oil, as well as live pigs, wool, cotton, and hemp. Without this, it would not be possible to balance surpluses and shortages, adjust the contradictions between supply and demand, stabilize market prices, and effectively restrict the development of capitalism. The rightists say that "unified purchase and sales have been messed up," because in this way, prices are stable, capitalism cannot develop, and their attempts to stir up trouble cannot be carried out. For them, this is indeed "terrible."

Of course, there are indeed some people in rural areas whose lives have not improved. One type is landlords and rich peasants. Another type is some wealthy middle peasants who originally had a lot of land and good livestock, but lacked labor. However, they are few in number, and in terms of living standards, they have not significantly decreased compared to the past. There is also a type of idler who does not work. It is natural that the lives of this part of the people have not improved. They account for only a very small number in rural areas. In addition to the above three types of people, there are still 7% to 8% of poor and lower-middle peasants who have difficulties. Due to lack of labor or natural and man-made disasters, their lives can only be maintained, and the degree of improvement in their lives has not reached the level of ordinary farmers. However, the lives of more than 80% of the farmers in rural areas have improved, which is an undeniable fact. The rightists shout that the lives of farmers are miserable, saying that "the lives of farmers are worse than before," that "farmers are approaching the brink of death," and that "the people whose living standards have improved are the Party members and cadres who used to wear broken shoes, but now sit in small cars and wear serge uniforms." It is very clear that they represent the small number of landlords and rich peasants who have flesh-and-blood relations with them. They are wholeheartedly complaining for the landlords and rich peasants. They hope that those who used to sit in cars and wear serge uniforms will always sit in cars and wear serge uniforms; they hope that those who used to wear broken shoes will always "wear broken shoes." They really hate Party members and cadres to the bone. However, even if they shout at the top of their lungs, the wheels of socialism will not turn back.

Does this mean that the current living standards of farmers are already very high? That is not the case. As Chairman Mao said, "Not only are the living standards of farmers low, but the living standards of workers and intellectuals are also low. It will take decades of arduous effort to gradually improve the living standards of all the people." This is precisely the task before us. We have never been satisfied with the achievements we have already made.

Do farmers have some opinions? Yes, they do. The fundamental reason for having opinions is that they are not used to the social system after it has just changed. For example, they feel that going to market and visiting relatives is not free, and pocket money is inconvenient, etc. But there are also many shortcomings in the management of agricultural cooperatives, such as unclear financial accounts, too many restrictions on the personal activities of members, too many and too long meetings, a small number of grassroots cadres not being democratic in their work style, forcing orders, and some cooperative cadres not participating in production and being separated from the masses. However, these shortcomings can be solved through criticism and self-criticism and by improving work methods. In fact, some of these problems have been solved, and some are being gradually solved. Farmers fully trust the leadership of the Party. They deeply understand that without the leadership of the Communist Party, it would not be possible to achieve such great achievements today, and they would never be able to get rid of poverty. They have never forgotten the saying "The Communist Party is our benefactor, and Chairman Mao is our savior." The rightists say that "workers and farmers are dissatisfied with the Party" and that the masses want to "overthrow the Communist Party and kill the Communists." This is a complete fabrication and slander. In fact, this is just a complete exposure of the rightists' own ugly thoughts.

The Rightists' Conspiracy to Restore Capitalism is Doomed to Failure

We do not deny that there are shortcomings and mistakes in our work. For example, in the past few years, we have not paid close attention to production in mountainous areas; last year, some wells did not produce water during the construction of water conservancy projects, wasting people's labor; overall consideration and unified arrangements in economic work were not enough; the allocation and supply of materials were not done well in some cases, resulting in some stockpiles and some out-of-stock, and even losses; after the second half of last year, ideological and political work lagged behind and could not keep up with the needs of the development of the situation, etc. Some of these shortcomings and mistakes are difficult to completely avoid, some could have been avoided but were not, and some were caused by bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. Since the beginning of the rectification campaign, many friends have made sharp and well-intentioned criticisms of these shortcomings; although some criticisms are relatively strong and some situations are not completely realistic, their intentions are good, and we appreciate this sincere help. We will try our best to absorb these correct opinions and spare no effort to improve our work. However, the rightists are in a different situation. They are not sincerely helping the Party to rectify. Their bones are filled with contempt and disgust for the working people. They are unwilling to look at the mainstream, deliberately treating trees as forests, exaggerating individual shortcomings, setting fires everywhere, slandering the Party's prestige among the masses, provoking the close alliance between workers and peasants, and inciting the masses to engage in "great democracy" movements. They are using this method in an attempt to achieve their goal of stealing the sky and changing the sun and usurping leadership. However, they are too blinded by greed. Farmers cannot be deceived by a few words. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they will move forward courageously along the bright road of socialism. The rightists' conspiracy to restore capitalism is just a waste of effort and is doomed to failure. Now, there are two paths in front of the rightists: one is to wake up, turn back to the shore, and bow to the people to admit their guilt; the other is to stubbornly persist and be stubborn to the end, resulting in self-isolation from the people. It is indeed "time" for the rightists to decide where to go.

If there are any errors in my speech, please criticize and correct me.

专栏：

    农民永远记得：共产党是恩人
    霍维德以甘肃农民生活改善情况驳斥右派分子的谰言
    周总理的政府工作报告和大会的各项报告，我都完全同意。我建议大会批准这些报告，并动员全国人民为彻底完成一九五七年的国家计划积极努力。现在，我仅就农民生活有无改善这个问题，根据甘肃的情况，谈一点个人的看法。
    甘肃农民解放前生活不如牛马，现在是生产积极性高涨
    大家知道，甘肃在解放以前，由于地主、官僚、军阀的残酷压榨和剥削，经济文化非常落后，各族人民的生活极为贫困，尤其是广大劳动农民，吃不饱，穿不暖，过着如牛如马的生活。那时，十几岁的姑娘没有裤子穿，一家五、六口人盖一块毡片片，一件棉袄要穿十来年；粮食根本不够吃，每年总要有四、五个月甚至半年吃糠咽菜，这些情况真是触目皆是，何止千万！解放以后，经过减租、反霸、土地改革、镇压反革命等一系列社会运动，生产力得到了解放，特别是一九五六年的春后，百分之九十七以上的农户加入了高级农业社，农民的生产积极性空前高涨，劳动效率大为提高。男男女女，投入了兴修水利、水土保持、土地加工、积肥除草、消灭四害等生产运动，并且充分利用了天时好的条件。去年一年就新修水地四百三十六万多亩，等于一九五○年到一九五五年六年发展水地面积的百分之一百二十点八，相当于解放前两千多年间所修水地面积的百分之七十二点三。一九五六年，全省获得了丰收，粮食总产量达到一百零九亿斤，比一九四九年增加了一倍半，比一九五五年的实产量增加了二十六亿三千万斤，超过解放前最高年产量的百分之七十三。
    由于农业生产的迅速提高，农民收入也不断增加。据一九五六年统计：全省农、副业总产值共为十三亿六千多万元，比一九五○年增加了一倍多，除去公粮、生产费用、公共积累和管理费外，平均每人收入七十五元上下。皋兰县庄子坪农业社，原来几乎年年闹饥荒，一九五五年全社缺粮户还占百分之九十以上，缺粮一百多万斤，一九五六年，由于农业合作化后农民生产热忱大大提高，大量兴修了水利，加以天时条件好，因而获得了空前丰收，社员每人平均净分现粮六百五十斤，全社共余粮一百三十九万斤，九百零六户社员中，四百零八户的收入够吃一年半，三百三十三户的收入够吃二年，还有八十九户的收入够吃三年以上，没有一户缺粮。
    由于农业生产的迅速提高，农民收入的不断增加，农民的购买力也就显著的增长。据统计：一九五○年平均每人只有六元，一九五六年即增为四十五元，增加了六倍半。为什么会增长得这样快呢？原因有四条：（1）甘肃农民解放前的购买力水平特别低，每人平均还不到六元；（2）甘肃的畜产品、药材和其他土特产品数量很大，解放后生产得到发展，有销路、价格合理，因而大大增加了农民的收入；
  （3）工农业建设和城市建设迅速开展，农民搞副业的门路多，如搞运输、打零工、编山货等，收入很大；（4）甘肃的土地广，潜力大，原来常年没收成的土地，只要浇上水就可以有二、三百斤的产量，农业收入增加得快。
    农民生活逐步提高，购买力一年比一年大
    农民购买力的迅速提高，也就意味着农民生活逐步改善。如定西县仁化高级农业社，一百六十户老社员中，土改前没有土地、没有房子的就有四十二户，常年出卖劳动力的七十户，有一百一十户常年缺口粮，要靠借高利贷，或者给地主、富农打些短工，才能维持生活。没穿没盖的现象更是普遍，有一个村子，五十一户只有六床被子、两块毛毡。到一九五六年，全社每人平均分粮一千八百五十一斤，余粮户达百分之八十四以上，没有一户缺粮，被子增加到六百九十八床，平均每户两床多。这个社的中等户宋得禄，全家六口人，夫妇两口、四个小孩。解放前主要靠出卖劳动力过生活，解放后生活逐年好转。一九五三年全家还只有一条破被子，缺口粮三个月；一九五四年全家都穿上了冬衣，只缺一个月口粮；一九五五年便成了余粮户，卖余粮七百斤，不仅穿上了新衣，还缝了一床新被子；一九五六年卖余粮二千斤，买皮大衣一件，全家都有了三季衣服可换，还买了被子、单子各一条，两个孩子也送到学校去上学。除上述情况外，解放以来，国家还向农村投放贷款一亿三千六百九十多万元，发放各种救济款两千六百二十多万元，两项合计，平均每户约达七十五元之多。现在，十几岁的姑娘没裤子穿的现象已经根本绝迹，五、六口人盖一块毡片片的现象也根本看不到了。农民对文化、卫生、交通运输以及其他生活必需品的需要，日益提高，截止目前，全省除国家举办的小学外，农业社自办的小学即达三千四百三十七所，学生人数达十六万五千五百七十七人，占全省入学儿童总数的百分之十七点七六；农业社自办的保健站（室）达一千八百五十七个；农民自己修的简易公路达八千四百多公里；很多农业社都装有电话机、收音机或扩音喇叭；每个农业社都有识字班或者夜校。农民对于棉布、食盐、烟、酒、糖等生活用品的需要量也大大增多，仅以棉布为例，一九五○年全省销售量为九十五万五千六百六十二匹，一九五六年即增为四百五十三万四千三百零四匹，增加了三点七倍，其中花布的销售量一九五六年即比一九五五年增加了百分之六十一点四。暖水瓶已成为农村通用的器具。球鞋、自行车也成为农村的畅销货。农民的肉食量也比从前大大增多，据我今年亲自了解九个农业社的情况，去年春节，差不多都是每户宰猪一口，而且大部分都完全是留着自己吃的，谁能说解放以来农民生活没有改善呢？谁能说党和政府不关心农民呢？右派分子为什么不去掉自己的黑眼镜来看看现实呢？
    农民中有问题也有意见，但是可以通过批评和自我批评以及改进工作加以解决
    随着农民收入的增加和购买力的提高，新的问题也就产生出来了。农民的新的惜售情绪，就是问题之一。例如生猪、羊皮、羊毛等，农民自用量大大增多，而出售量却增长很慢，结果便形成国家需要、农民不卖，农村积压、城市脱销。这就是国家、集体、个人三者之间的矛盾。要解决这个矛盾，除了经常加强对农民的宣传教育外，国家必须对有关国计民生的主要产品，如粮食、棉布、油料以及生猪、羊毛、棉麻等，分别实行统购统销和掌握收购、控制供应的政策。不如此，就不能平衡余缺、调整供求之间的矛盾；就不能稳定市场物价；就不能有效限制资本主义的发展。右派分子说“统购统销搞糟了”，这是因为，这样一来物价稳定了，资本主义不能发展了，他们想兴风作浪的企图也就不能施展了。这对他们来说确实是“糟得很”。
    当然，农村中确有一些人的生活没有改善。一种是地主、富农分子。另一种是原来土地多、牲口好、但是劳动力缺乏的一部分富裕中农，不过他们为数不多，从生活水平上说，比以前也并没有显著降低。还有一种是游手好闲的二流子，这一部分人的生活没有提高也是自然的，这在农村只占极少数。除以上三种人以外，贫农和下中农中，也还有百分之七、八的困难户，他们或因劳动力不足，或因天灾人祸，生活仅能维持，生活改善的程度，还达不到一般农民的水平。但是，占农村人口百分之八十以上的农民，生活是改善了，这是抹煞不了的事实。右派分子叫喊农民生活苦，说“农民生活不如从前了”，“农民已经接近死亡的边缘”，并且说“生活水平提高的是过去穿破鞋，现坐小卧车、穿呢子制服的党员和干部”，事实很明显，他们代表着与他们有血肉关系的少数地主、富农，他们是忠心耿耿的在为地主、富农喊冤。他们希望过去坐卧车、穿呢子制服的永远坐卧车、穿呢子制服；希望过去穿破鞋的永远“穿破鞋”，他们对党员和干部真是恨入骨髓。然而，纵然声嘶力竭的叫喊也罢，社会主义的车轮是不会倒转的。
    是不是说农民现在的生活水平已经很高了？那也不是的。正如毛主席所说的：“不但农民的生活水平低，工人和知识分子的生活水平也都还低，要有几十年时间，经过艰苦的努力，才能将全体人民的生活水平逐步提高起来”，这也正是摆在我们面前的任务。我们从来没有满足过已经得到的成绩。
    农民是不是有些意见呢？是有的。有意见的根本原因是社会制度刚一改变不习惯，例如他们觉得赶集、串亲戚不自由，零用钱不方便等等。但也有许多确是农业社经营管理中的缺点，例如财务账目不清，对社员的个人活动限制过多，会议过多过长，少数基层干部作风不民主、强迫命令，有些社干不经常参加生产、脱离群众等等。但是，这些缺点是能够通过批评与自我批评的方法，通过改进工作的方法加以解决的。事实上这些问题有的已经解决，有的正在逐步的解决当中。农民完全信任党的领导，他们深深的理解：没有共产党的领导，就不可能得到今天这样伟大的成绩；就不会有今天这样的好日子；他们也就永远摆脱不了贫困。他们时刻没有忘记“共产党是恩人、毛主席是救星”这句话。右派分子说“工人、农民对党不满”，群众要“推翻共产党，要杀共产党人”，这是彻底的造谣和诬蔑。其实，这不过是右派分子自己的丑恶思想的彻底暴露而已。
    右派分子的复辟阴谋是注定要破产的
    我们不否认，我们工作中有缺点，也有错误。例如：几年来我们对于山区生产抓的不紧；去年在兴修水利中有些井没有出水，浪费了民力；经济工作中的全面照顾、统筹安排作的不够；物资的调配供应工作有些没有作好，形成有的积压，有的脱销，甚至造成了损失；去年下半年以后，思想政治工作落后了，赶不上形势发展的需要，等等。这些缺点和错误，有些是难以完全避免的，有些是可以避免而没有避免，有些则是由于官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义所造成。整风开始以来，许多朋友对我们的这些缺点提出了尖锐而善意的批评；有些批评虽然言词比较激烈，情况也有些不完全切实，但是他们的用心是好的，我们感激这种诚心的帮助。我们将尽量吸取这些正确的意见，不遗余力的改进工作。但是，右派分子则是另外一种情况，他们不是心怀诚意的帮助党整风，他们骨子里充满着对劳动人民的轻视和反感，他们不愿意看主流，故意把树木当森林，把个别缺点，加以渲染夸大，到处点火，诋毁党在群众中的威信，挑拨工人与农民的亲密联盟，煽动群众搞“大民主”运动。他们就是采取这种手法，企图达到他们偷天换日、篡夺领导的目的。然而，他们未免太利令智昏了。农民不是三言两语可以欺骗的，他们将在共产党的领导下，沿着社会主义的光明大道，勇往直前。右派分子的资本主义复辟阴谋，不过是枉费心机，注定要破产的。现在，摆在右派分子面前有两条路：一条是幡然悔悟，回头是岸，向人民低头认罪；一条是执迷不悟，顽固到底，结果只有自绝于人民。右派分子何去何从，现在的确“是时候了”。
    我的发言如有错误的地方，请代表们批评指正。
