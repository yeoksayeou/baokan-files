    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 24th: According to the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun," the U.S. Department of Defense has suggested that Japan purchase new U.S. weapons, and then Japan manufactures other weapons to supply Southeast Asian countries, especially member states of the Manila Treaty Organization.
    The newspaper said that the purpose of the U.S. suggestion is to enhance Japan's "defense potential" and to arm the member states of the Manila Treaty Organization. The news said that this suggestion is part of the U.S. policy of strengthening the Manila Treaty Organization.
    The suggestion was made by U.S. Department of Defense officials during a meeting with Kogoro Uemura, vice-chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, who accompanied the Japanese Prime Minister on a visit to the United States. According to this suggestion, Japan uses yen to purchase new U.S. weapons, and the yen proceeds are accumulated in Japan. Japan then uses this money to manufacture weapons, which are then sold or leased to Southeast Asian countries.
    "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Defense Agency, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry will hold a joint meeting to decide Japan's attitude towards the U.S. suggestion.

    美国打算用新武器武装日本
    并企图使日本成为马尼拉集团兵工厂
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：据日本“读卖新闻”报道，美国国防部已经建议日本购买美国的新式武器，然后日本再制造其他武器供给东南亚国家，特别是马尼拉条约组织会员国。
    这家报纸说，美国这个建议的目的是增强日本的“防卫潜力”，同时武装马尼拉条约组织会员国。消息说，这个建议是美国企图加强马尼拉条约组织的政策的一部分。
    这个建议是美国国防部官员同伴随日本首相访问美国的日本经济团体联合会副会长植村甲午郎会谈时提出的。根据这个建议，日本用日元购买美国的新式武器，其日元价款积存在日本，日本再利用这笔钱来制造武器，然后把它们出售或者出租给东南亚国家。
    “读卖新闻”说，日本外务省、防卫厅、大藏省和通商产业省将一起开会，决定日本对美国这项建议的态度。
