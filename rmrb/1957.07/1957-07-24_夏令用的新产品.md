    New Products for Summer Use
    Air Freshener
    In summer, when watching plays or listening to reports, halls are especially stuffy. Now there is an "Air Freshener" which, when sprayed in meeting places or hot workshops, makes people feel refreshed and cool. Moreover, this air freshener also has a sterilizing effect.

    Air Freshener is synthesized from peppermint oil, tangerine oil, and eight other different fragrances and other raw materials. The Shanghai Continental Chemical Products Factory began mass production at the beginning of this month.

    Each pound of concentrated air freshener can be mixed with 20 to 50 times its weight in water. Each time, spraying one pound of the diluted solution costs only a little over one dime.
    Sunscreen Cream
    "Sunscreen Cream," which can protect the skin under strong sunlight, is also a new product from the Continental Chemical Products Factory in July. This product and "Sunscreen Oil," which the Meitong Chemical Industry Factory recently started producing, were both shipped and available in the market two or three days ago.

    Among the raw materials used in these two kinds of sunscreen creams and oils, there is a special chemical material that, when applied to the skin, can block some of the excessive ultraviolet rays, preventing the skin from being damaged. A purchasing agent from the Continental Factory applied the sunscreen cream only to his right arm, leaving his left arm bare. He rode his bicycle under the sun for three hours, and as a result, his left arm was red and dark, while his right arm only turned slightly red.
    Glass Women's Leather Shoes
    Nine new styles of hollowed-out glass women's leather shoes are a new attempt by the Shanghai Standard Leather Shoe Factory this year. They weave various plastic colored glass silks and glass strips into various patterns to replace leather for the uppers of women's shoes. The uppers are also lined with cloth or waxed thread, so the shoes will not deform even after being worn for a long time.

    These shoes do not usually need shoe polish. When they get dirty, they can be restored to their original shine with just a wipe of ice water.

    The Standard Factory has produced nearly 6,000 pairs of these women's shoes this year, saving a lot of leather.
    Sweet Beer
    Beer is originally a very good summer beverage, but some people find it bitter and difficult to drink freely. A new batch of beer made by the Shanghai Huaguang Brewery last month tastes completely different. It not only lacks a strong bitter taste but, on the contrary, is very pleasantly sweet and also has a very fragrant flavor. The alcohol content is also much lower than in the past.

    Sweet beer is made by the Huaguang Factory learning from Polish experience. Now, the first batch of more than 10,000 bottles has been bottled and will meet consumers in a few days.
    Appealing Candies
    Why do people not like to eat candy in the summer? The Shanghai Yimin Food Factory No. 1 found that the main reason is that some candies contain too much fat, making them feel greasy. Therefore, they tried to produce four types of candies that contain little or no fat.

    Some of these candies have a mint flavor, and some have a spearmint flavor. One type of high-grade hard candy has crystal-like transparent grains with a light green or light yellow color, and it is wrapped in a layer of transparent paper with white small squares on the outside, giving people a cool feeling and making them want to taste it.

### 夏令用的新产品

    夏令用的新产品
    空气清香剂
    在夏天看戏、听报告，场子里显得特别闷热。现在有一种“空气清香剂”，它喷射在会场里或高温车间里，会使人觉得清香又凉快，而且这种清香剂还有杀菌的作用。
    空气清香剂是用薄荷油、桔子油等八种不同的香料和其他原料合成的。上海大陆化学制品厂在本月初已开始大量生产。
    每一斤清香剂的浓液可以掺二十倍到五十倍水，每次喷一斤冲淡的水剂，只化一角多钱。
    防晒油膏
    在强烈的阳光下可以保护皮肤的“防晒雪花膏”，也是大陆化学制品厂7月份的新产品。这种产品和美通化学工业厂最近开始生产的“防晒油”，在两三天以前都已出厂供应了。
    这两种防晒油膏用的原料中，有一种是特殊的化学原料，把它擦在皮肤上，可以把一部分过多的紫外线挡住，使皮肤不被损伤。大陆厂的一个采购人员把防晒雪花膏只擦在右手手臂上，左手不擦，他骑着自行车在太阳底下晒了三个钟头，结果左手又红又黑，右手只红了一点点。
    玻璃女皮鞋
    九种新式的镂空玻璃女皮鞋，是上海标准皮鞋厂今年的一种新尝试。他们把各种塑料做的彩色玻璃丝和玻璃带，编织成各种图案，代替皮革来做女皮鞋的鞋面。鞋面里还用衬布或蜡线，鞋子穿久了也不会变形。
    这些皮鞋平时用不着擦皮鞋油，穿脏了只要用冰水一揩，就可以恢复它原有的光泽。
    标准厂今年生产了近六千双这种女皮鞋，节约了许多皮革。
    甜啤酒
    啤酒原来是一种很好的夏季饮料，但是有些人觉得它有苦味，难以畅饮。上海华光啤酒厂上个月做成的一批新啤酒，味道完全不同，它不但没有很浓的苦味，相反却甜得非常适口，而且还带有一种很香的味道，酒精成分也比过去淡了许多。
    甜啤酒是华光厂学习波兰的经验制成的。现在，第一批一万多瓶都已经装瓶，过几天就要同消费者见面了。
    引人的糖果
    夏天，为什么人们不太喜欢吃糖？上海益民食品一厂研究的结果，发现其中主要原因是有些糖果内含的脂肪太多，吃了发腻。于是，他们试制了四种不含和很少含脂肪的糖果。
    这些糖果有的带薄荷味，有的带留兰香味。有一种高级硬糖，糖粒像晶体一样的透明，带有淡绿或淡黄的颜色，外面又包上一层有白色的小方格子的透明纸，使人看了有一种清凉的感觉，很想尝一尝它的味道。　（新华社）
