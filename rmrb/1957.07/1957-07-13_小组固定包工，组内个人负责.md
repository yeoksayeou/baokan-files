To strengthen the quality of weeding, the Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Baiquan Township, Heshun County, Shanxi Province, has changed its temporary work groups into fixed-responsibility weeding work groups during the summer weeding season this year. The entire autumn seedlings, from the beginning of weeding to the end, are contracted to the groups for collective operation. To facilitate the participation of elderly men and women with children in labor, a system of individual responsibility within the group has been added. This solves the contradiction between cooperative labor and household chores and also makes full use of auxiliary labor.

To ensure reasonable compensation and maintain the enthusiasm of cooperative members, the team and group both calculate the time required to complete the task based on labor and task, and implement a progressive bonus system for exceeding the quota. If 10% more work of the required quality is completed within the allotted time, the earned remuneration for the exceeded portion will be rewarded with an additional labor day; if 20% more work is completed, it will be rewarded with two additional labor days, and so on. Those who fail to complete the task on time or who fail to complete the task with the required quality, even if on time, will be given criticism and education for minor offenses, and point deductions for serious offenses (the deduction standard should be less than 50% of the reward points). Groups that receive awards will distribute the bonus in proportion to the members' labor remuneration in weeding; if points are deducted, they will be evenly distributed based on the members' basic labor points.

    小组固定包工，组内个人负责
    本报讯　山西省和顺县白泉乡黎明农业社，为了加强锄苗的作业质量，今年在夏锄期间将临时作业小组改变为固定责任包锄作业小组，把全部秋苗由开锄到锄末一直包干到组，由组集体操作。为便利老汉和有小孩的妇女参加劳动，组内附加个人包作责任制。这样，既解决了社务劳动和家务劳动的矛盾，也使辅助劳力得到了充分的利用。
    为做到报酬合理，保持社员的劳动积极性，队、组都以劳力和任务计算出完成任务所用的时间，执行超额累计奖励制。凡在定时之内，按质超额完成10％的作业，就以超过部分应得的报酬加记劳动日一倍；如超作20％，加记劳动日二倍，以此累计作为奖励。如不能按时完成任务或虽按时但不能按质完成任务者，轻的批评教育，重的扣分（扣分标准应少于奖分的50％）。凡得奖的组，按社员在锄苗中的劳动报酬以比例计算分奖；如被扣分应按社员劳力底分均摊。
