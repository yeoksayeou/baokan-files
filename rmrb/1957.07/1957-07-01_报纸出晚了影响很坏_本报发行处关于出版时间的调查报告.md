    Late Newspaper Delivery Has a Very Bad Impact
    --An Investigation Report from the Newspaper Distribution Department Regarding Publication Time
    Editor's Note: For a long period, our newspaper has failed to adhere to on-time publication. In January and February of this year, the situation improved slightly, but after March, the publication time has been increasingly delayed. We have received many letters from readers, offering criticism and accusations, hoping for a swift change in this situation. The readers' opinions and requests are completely correct and reasonable. Therefore, this newspaper has consulted with other newspapers, news agencies, and post offices in Beijing and decided to uniformly advance the publication time from July 5th, with a trial run starting on July 1st. To ensure everyone understands the impact of delayed newspaper publication, this newspaper published three readers' letters yesterday, and today we are publishing two reports. We hope to gain the supervision of the broad masses of readers, the cooperation of the newspaper's authors, and the assistance of relevant departments. At the same time, the newspaper's editorial department is also actively working to correct shortcomings and strive for on-time newspaper publication.
    In January and February 1957, the People's Daily's publication time was generally normal. However, from March onwards, it was frequently delayed. In March, only ten days saw printing start at the prescribed time (4:00 AM), four days in April, five days in May, and only one day in June. This situation is very serious.
    When the People's Daily is published on time, readers in the city generally receive the newspaper between 6:30 AM and 8:00 AM; newspapers for other cities generally catch the first train; and the airmail stereotype plates for other regions generally catch the plane, except when weather conditions prevent takeoff. Under these circumstances, the post office's distribution work can also proceed normally.
    Starting in March, due to the increasingly late publication time, generally starting printing at 5:00 or 6:00 AM, and sometimes as late as 7:00 AM, a series of impacts have occurred.
    First, readers cannot receive the newspaper on time. After March, readers in the city generally had to wait until after 10:00 AM, sometimes until 2:00 or 3:00 PM, to see the newspaper; occasionally, they had to wait until 4:00 or 5:00 PM. Newspapers sent from Beijing to other cities also could not catch the train on time. For example, in May, newspapers sent to Tianjin missed the train on twenty-three days, totaling 230,000 copies. Newspapers sent to cities along the Beijing-Hankou line missed the train entirely on eighteen days, and partially missed the train on thirteen days, totaling 1.4 million copies. Newspapers sent to cities along the Beijing-Baotou line missed the train on twenty-three days during the month, totaling 570,000 copies.
    Due to the late publication time, the newspaper's airmail stereotype plates for other regions sometimes miss the plane and cannot be shipped out on time. For example, in June, the stereotype plates sent to Kunming missed the plane on seven days, the plates sent to Xi'an missed the plane on six days, the plates sent to Urumqi missed the plane on three days, and the plates sent to Chengdu missed the plane on six days. Since some places do not have daily flights, if the newspaper is published late and the stereotype plates cannot be sent out on time, it often leads to two, three, or even four days' worth of plates being shipped all at once. With so many plates arriving at once, it is impossible for the local areas to print them on the same day, so readers in many regions sometimes do not see a newspaper for several days, or sometimes receive a large pile at once, without time to read them.
    Secondly, because the newspaper cannot be published on time, it seriously affects the normal order of the post office's distribution work and prolongs the working hours of distribution personnel. Taking the Beijing Post Office as an example, there are 640 distribution personnel and delivery workers. If each person's working hours are extended by an average of one hour per day, that amounts to 19,200 hours per month. At the same time, it disrupts the post office's work procedures, creating chaos and increasing the likelihood of errors.
    Every time the newspaper is published late, the Beijing Post Office has to add nine more trucks in the city, and the reserved tonnage of the day's mail train (train) is wasted, while the next day's volume doubles, crowding out books, magazines, and other mail that should be shipped on time. This economic loss and waste in transportation is also considerable.
    Because some readers do not understand that the main reason for the late delivery of the newspaper is the late publication of the newspaper, they mistakenly believe that the delivery personnel are irresponsible and therefore criticize the delivery workers. Some individual readers sometimes even satirize or scold the delivery workers, causing some newly employed delivery workers to be afraid of seeing readers and regard delivering newspapers as a daunting task, greatly affecting their work morale.
    The broad masses of readers' desire to see the newspaper in a timely manner is very reasonable. They eagerly want to know the new things happening on the same day and the development trends of important events. We have no reason to prevent the newspaper from being published on time, and we should do everything possible to meet the needs of the broad masses.

    报纸出晚了影响很坏
    ——本报发行处关于出版时间的调查报告
    编者按：在一个很长的时期内，我们的报纸都没有坚持按时出版。今年1、2两月，情况稍有转变，可是3月以后，出版时间又越来越迟。我们曾经收到很多读者来信，提出批评和指责，希望迅速改变这种情况。读者的意见和要求，是完全正确的合理的。为此，本报已同北京各报纸、通讯社、邮局共同协商，决定从7月5日一律提早出版时间，并从7月1日试行。为了使大家都了解报纸出版延误后的影响，昨天本报发表了三封读者来信，今天又发表了两个报告，我们希望借此取得广大读者的监督，取得本报作者的合作，取得各有关部门的协助。同时，本报编辑部也正积极努力，改正缺点，为争取报纸按时出版而奋斗。
    1957年1、2两月，人民日报出版时间一般都比较正常，但从3月以后，就经常晚点，3月份只有十天按照规定时间（早上四点钟）开印，4月份只有四天，5月份只有五天，6月份只有一天。这个情况是十分严重的。
    人民日报按照正常时间出版的时候，本市读者一般都能在早上六点半到八点左右看到报纸；外埠报纸一般也能及时赶上第一班火车；发往外地的航空版纸型，除因气候影响不能起飞的情况以外，一般都能赶上飞机。在此情况下，邮局的发行工作也能正常进行。
    3月份起，由于出版时间愈来愈晚，一般是在五、六点钟开印，有时最晚到七点多钟，因而发生了一系列的影响。
    首先是读者不能按时收到报纸。3月份以后，本市读者一般要在上午十点以后、有时要在午后两三点钟才能看到报纸；个别的时候，还要到四、五点钟才能看到报纸。由北京发往外埠的报纸，也不能及时赶上火车。以5月份为例，发往天津的报纸，有二十三天、共计二十三万份报纸没有及时赶上火车。发往京汉线各城市的报纸，全部没有赶上火车的有十八天，部分没有赶上火车的有十三天，共计一百四十万份报纸没有及时发出。发往京包线各城市的报纸，全月有二十三次共计五十七万份报纸没有及时赶上火车。
    由于出版时间晚，本报外地航空版纸型有时也赶不上飞机，不能及时运出。如6月份发往昆明的纸型就有七天没有赶上飞机，发往西安的纸型有六天没有赶上飞机，发往乌鲁木齐的纸型有三天没有赶上飞机，发往成都的纸型有六天没有赶上飞机。由于有些地方本来就不是每天都有班机，如果再加上报纸出版晚，纸型不能按时发出，往往就形成两、三天，甚至三、四天的纸型一齐运出的情况。这样多的纸型一下运到，各地根本不可能在当天印出，因而很多地区的读者，有时几天看不到一张报，有时一来一大堆，没有时间阅读。
    其次，由于报纸不能按时出版，严重地影响了邮局发行工作的正常秩序，延长了发行人员的工作时间。仅以北京邮局为例，发行人员和投递员每天有六百四十人，如果每人平均每天延长一小时，一个月就是一万九千二百小时。同时还打乱了邮局的工作程序，造成忙乱，易于发生差错。
    报纸晚出版一次，北京邮局在市内就得增开九部汽车，预留的当日的邮车（火车）吨位，也只有白白浪费，而次日运量倍增，又挤掉应该按时运出的书刊或其他邮件。这种经济上的损失和运输方面的浪费也是十分可观的。
    由于有些读者不了解报纸投递得晚的原因主要在于报纸出版得晚，而误以为是投递人员不负责任，因此对投递员多所责难。还有个别读者，有时甚至讽刺或漫骂投递员，使得有些新参加工作的投递员都怕见读者，把投送报纸视为畏途，大大影响了他们的工作情绪。
    广大读者希望及时看到报纸的要求是很合理的，他们渴切要求尽快知道当天发生的新事物，和重要事件的发展动向。我们没有理由使报纸不能按时出版，我们应尽一切可能来满足广大群众的需要。
