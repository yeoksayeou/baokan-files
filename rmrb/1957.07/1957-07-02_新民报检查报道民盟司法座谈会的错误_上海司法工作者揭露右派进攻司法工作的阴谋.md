*Xinmin Evening News* Self-Criticizes Erroneous Reporting on Democratic League Judicial Symposium; Shanghai Judicial Workers Expose Rightists' Conspiracy to Attack Judicial Work

(Our Dispatch) Shanghai *Xinmin Evening News* reports: To refute the various reactionary statements and actions of rightists against judicial work in recent times, and to solicit criticism and opinions from the judicial sector on the shortcomings and errors in the *Xinmin Evening News*'s publicity and reporting work, the *Xinmin Evening News* editorial department invited some Shanghai judicial workers to hold a symposium on June 24.

Judicial workers unanimously stated that Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," after its full text was published, had great guiding significance for our construction of socialism and correct handling of contradictions among the people. The six political criteria proposed in the speech are powerful weapons for us to distinguish between right and wrong and to fight against rightists. After studying the speech, judicial workers have become even clearer about the nature of contradictions among the people, the scope of the people's democratic dictatorship, and their own responsibilities.

During the symposium, judicial workers spoke enthusiastically on issues such as the legal system, some views on judicial reform, the use of intellectuals, and the exercise of judicial power by worker-peasant cadres. At the same time, they resolutely refuted and exposed the various rumors, slanders, and anti-socialist conspiracies of the rightists.

The Tremendous Achievements of Judicial Work Are Obvious to All; The Rightists' Slanders Are Malicious and Conspiratorial

Feng Ertai of the Shanghai Municipal Higher People's Court spoke about the tremendous achievements made by the People's Court with the cooperation of other judicial organs and the assistance of the broad masses of the people; he exposed the anti-socialist conspiratorial activities carried out in Shanghai by rightists such as Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu under the guise of people's representatives. Wang Ronghai of the Municipal Higher People's Court said that the People's Court is a tool of the people's democratic dictatorship. Like People's Courts at all levels in this city and throughout the country, our courts rely on the masses, cooperate with public security, procuratorial and other departments, and punish counter-revolutionaries and various criminal elements in accordance with national policies and laws, and have resolved many civil disputes among the people. The achievements are tremendous, and this is a fact obvious to all. In recent years, criminal cases have been greatly reduced, the legal order has been increasingly consolidated, and our legal system is constantly being improved and developed along with the progress of society. At present, the state's legislative work, in terms of the formulation of criminal and civil codes, has not yet further systematized and codified existing policies, individual laws, decrees, and practical experience in class struggle, production, and life. It is understandable that some people in society have raised opinions and demands on this matter in good faith, but a few rightists, such as Huang Shaohong and Wang Zao, have taken advantage of this situation to exaggerate and portray it as our "failure to emphasize the legal system" and "lack of a legal system," and have seized the opportunity to attack judicial work. They have exaggerated individual shortcomings in judicial work into a comprehensive problem, saying that judicial organs do not enforce the law, enforce the law arbitrarily, and violate human rights, making it sound like a complete mess! Yang Zhaolong put forward his legislative line, which in fact requires us to continue using the Kuomintang's "Six Codes"; Wang Zao said that China is now ruled by "men" not by law. The rightists' conspiracy is to attempt to establish bourgeois "democracy" in China, which is futile. Wang Ronghai believes that we must distinguish our legislative line from Yang Zhaolong's legislative line; distinguish our socialist legal system from Wang Zao's "rule by men" viewpoint; distinguish our "all counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, all mistakes must be corrected" from Huang Shaohong's speaking for counter-revolutionary elements and saying that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was wrong." We must resolutely draw a line between ourselves and the rightists' absurd remarks about judicial work, and launch a struggle.

The *Xinmin Evening News* Published Some People's Absurd and Slanderous Remarks at the Democratic League Judicial Symposium

Cai Mingbiao of the Municipal Second Intermediate People's Court pointed out that Li Guoji's statement at the Democratic League Judicial Symposium published in the *Xinmin Evening News* on May 19, saying that "the judges now can legislate at will and sentence as they please," and someone's statement in the newspaper that "there are still corrupt officials who disregard human life," are all absurd and slanderous remarks that have aroused great anger among court workers. He said that although a complete set of laws has not been formulated since liberation due to the rapid development of the political situation and objective limitations, the People's Government has actually promulgated many laws and regulations, and the exercise of judicial power is organized in accordance with the law. He questioned: As a people's lawyer, does Li Guoji not understand these circumstances? What is the intention of spreading provocative remarks? Lin Jingyang of the Second Legal Advisory Office said: The rightist Yang Zhaolong used many absurd arguments in an article to slander that our country has no rule of law, which is actually slandering that our country has no democracy, which is also slandering our socialism. Dong Jingzhi of the Justice Bureau used the fact of the jury system in judicial practice to illustrate that our country has the rule of law. He said: The people's judicial work is carried out seriously and resolately in accordance with the various provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Organic Law of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China, thus embodying the legitimacy of judicial work; at the same time, it also embodies the superiority of the people being the masters of their own affairs. For example, our courts have developed more than 8,200 fixed rotating jurors (not counting temporary invitations), who are not only directly elected by the people, but also come from all strata of society. Except for simple civil cases, minor criminal cases, and cases otherwise stipulated by law, the jury system has now been fully implemented in first-instance cases. People's jurors and judges enjoy equal rights in both investigation and judgment. Tong Jiefan of the Civil Division of the Higher People's Court commented on this issue, saying that in civil cases, the most common are marriage, debt, and housing, and in handling these cases, the government has successively promulgated the Marriage Law, Measures for Handling Rural Debt Disputes in Newly Liberated Areas, Provisional Regulations for Private Enterprises, and measures related to fixed interest rates for joint state-private enterprises and the clearing of assets and verification of capital, and the elimination of illegal exploitation by usurers and second landlords, and policies to protect the legitimate interests of homeowners since 1949. These laws and policies are the basis of our judicial work, so how can we say that there is "no law to abide by"?

Sun Shile of the Yulin District Court said: The rightists' saying that "there is no law to abide by, the law is not abided by, and the law is arbitrarily abided by" is completely slanderous. If it were really as the rightists said, social order would have been in chaos long ago. In fact, we have laws to abide by. Aren't policies, laws, orders, and regulations "laws"? I don't know what kind of law the rightists are referring to. Is it the so-called law of capitalist countries? It seems that they don't regard the people's law as law. Furthermore, the rightists say that the law is not abided by, as if the judges have great power. In fact, the judicial work is carried out with the supervision of jurors, superiors, the masses, and other organs. How can the judges do whatever they want? She angrily stated that the rightists should stand up and clarify the issue in the people's newspapers. Ye Kexin of the First Legal Advisory Office said: The rightists are taking advantage of the rectification movement to attack the Party, saying that our legal system is not good. Their intention is to guide our legal system to the path of American-style capitalist law that opposes the people's democratic dictatorship. We resolutely cannot tolerate this. Zhang Mengfei of the Jiangning District People's Court said: Another fallacy of the rightists is that our past judicial reforms were a mess. What are the facts? Before the old legal viewpoints were criticized through judicial reform, many personnel had problems in their position, viewpoint, and method of handling cases. For example, when I was an intern in the South District Division, I saw judges detain more than 30 people a day for money debt lawsuits without analysis and research. This clearly shows the drawbacks of the old legal viewpoints. How can we not change this?

The Rightists Vainly Attempt to Kill Worker-Peasant Cadres With One Blow

When criticizing the fallacy of "intellectuals being 'utilized, restricted, and transformed'," everyone said that the Party has not mistreated intellectuals, and the vast majority of intellectuals support the Party. The rightists' spreading the fallacy of so-called "intellectuals being utilized, restricted, and transformed" is to pull intellectuals to their side to oppose the Party, but the broad masses of patriotic intellectuals will be able to distinguish between right and wrong, and the rightists are wasting their efforts. Cai Mingbiao said, I am an intellectual from a student background. After graduating from the East China University of Political Science and Law in 1954, the organization assigned me to work in the Municipal People's Court. In order to familiarize myself with judicial business, I first served as a clerk for more than a year. The leaders of the court and the chief clerk cared for and helped me in business everywhere, and the team leader also made a training plan (which I only learned about later when I was appointed as an assistant judge). After being appointed as an assistant judge, I encountered many difficulties in business, and I was not sure about the cases and my work plan was chaotic. The court president and the surrounding Party comrades all tried to find ways for me and put forward suggestions for improving my work. In all these things, I only feel that I am being trained by the Party in my daily work; I also feel that I am contributing to the socialist construction of the motherland, and I do not feel that I am being "utilized" or "restricted" at all. Cai Mingbiao also criticized someone's ugly description of worker-peasant cadres at the symposium convened by the Democratic League, saying that "people who can't even recognize a few words can be judges," "if they leave the clerk, they can't conduct judicial work," "judges can't write judgments is now a common phenomenon," and other fallacies. He said that it is a fact that a small number of worker-peasant cadres have a lower level of education, but it is definitely not a "common phenomenon." Worker-peasant cadres have many advantages that are worth learning from intellectuals. Intellectuals and worker-peasant cadres can help each other and improve each other when working together for socialist cause. The rightists deliberately exaggerate shortcomings in order to kill worker-peasant cadres with one blow and exclude them from the People's Court. People who spread this fallacy should examine their own positions!

Denying the Great Achievements of Judicial Reform is a Conspiracy of the Rightists

Mei Erhe of the Municipal Higher People's Court used his own personal experience to illustrate that from the perspective of the court, the policy of "unity, education, and transformation" for intellectuals has been correctly implemented. He said that he used to be an old judicial worker. After liberation, under the education of the Party, he worked hard to transform himself, and he is still engaged in judicial work. He mentioned that during the judicial reform in the early days of liberation, a group of judicial workers were transferred to other jobs. He believes that if we can relate this to the situation of class struggle at that time, doing so was completely correct. These comrades have been working peacefully in other jobs for several years. The rightist Yang Zhaolong published an article in the newspaper, saying that this was the Party's "sectarianism," which is completely nonsense. Through judicial reform, not only was the organization purified and the old legal viewpoints criticized, but also a clear line was drawn between the old and new ideologies. Denying the great achievements of judicial reform is a conspiracy of the rightists, and we must resolutely refute it.

Why Don't the Rightists Emphasize the Class Nature of Law? Their Purpose is to Have the Working Class Lay Down the Weapons of Dictatorship

Lin Jingyang of the Second Legal Advisory Office said that Li Guoji said that intellectuals are "restricted" to the 25th grade, but in fact, he himself is the 21st grade. None of those people he talked about is in the 25th grade. Take me, an intellectual, as an example. After graduating from the East China University of Political Science and Law in 1954, I participated in the work of judicial organs and have been very happy. I used to be the 22nd grade, and now I am the 21st grade. None of the twelve people who came out of school with me are now below the 23rd grade. Some people obviously know these facts, so why do they say those things? This is obviously ulterior motive. Dong Jingzhi of the Justice Bureau said that Yang Zhaolong, on the one hand, emphasized the scientific and technical nature of law, and on the other hand, emphasized the low cultural level of worker-peasant cadres and their lack of understanding of law. This statement is not only an insult to worker-peasant cadres, but also an attempt to have the working class lay down the weapons of dictatorship. If not, why not emphasize the class nature of law! In fact, the cultural level of worker-peasant cadres is not as low as these people say, and they are not ignorant of the law. It is not in accordance with the facts to generalize by using individual judges who have difficulty writing judgments. This instead provokes the unity of worker-peasant cadres and intellectuals. Party and government and judicial business departments at all levels have taken various measures to cultivate worker-peasant cadres and intellectuals. For example: * Every year, a certain number of cadres are transferred to the Central Political and Legal Cadre School and the Shanghai Municipal Judicial Cadre Training Class to study legal theory and policy business in rotation; * A part of the in-service cadres are organized to participate in the correspondence department of the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law to study legal science; * The remaining in-service cadres regularly hold regular lectures on basic legal theory and business reports to conduct systematic study of legal theory and business; * A very small number of those with a low level of education also participate in the spare-time literacy schools run by Party committees at all levels in this city to learn culture. Li Shutang of the Lawyers Association said that as a member of the Democratic League, I am indignant at the rightists' malicious slander. Before liberation, I studied the old law. After liberation, I served as a judge for three years, and now I am a lawyer. The Party has always trusted me very much. There are also many other university graduates who are judges. The facts are all there. How can we say that the Party is "utilizing, restricting, and transforming" intellectuals?

The Court's Cultivation of Worker-Peasant Cadres and Intellectuals Has Achieved Great Results

Tong Jiefan of the Civil Division of the Higher People's Court said, I am a graduate of the law department of a university, and I am a non-Party cadre who joined the court in 1950. I feel that the Party's cultivation, education, and use of me are appropriate. Speaking of "position" and "grade," I am now a judge, and no Party member judge has a "grade" higher than mine. The entire court has plans for the cultivation of cadres, regardless of worker-peasant cadres or intellectuals, and has achieved great results. Because I have been the leader of the trial team for several years, I am often cultivated, and I often help others. Even today, this work is still in progress. Hua Maosheng of the Tilanqiao District People's Court said that I graduated from university in 1952 and went to work in the court. In 1953, I was transferred to be an assistant judge, and this year I was transferred to be a judge, which shows that the Party attaches great importance to me, an intellectual. I think that the Party's greatest attention to me is to care for us politically. Zhou Shiyu of the First Legal Advisory Office said in a written statement that the Party and the government have always attached great importance to and cared for intellectuals, but intellectuals also have weaknesses. Many of them come from exploiting class families and bring many non-proletarian ideas. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out ideological transformation. In the past few years since liberation, our intellectuals have made great progress through ideological transformation, and many comrades in judicial organs have joined the Party one after another.

Sun Shile of the Yulin District Court said: The rightists slandered that it is a common phenomenon that worker-peasant cadres cannot write judgments, but in our court, there is not a single worker-peasant cadre who cannot write judgments. Throughout the city, there may be individual cases, but the rightists say that it is universal, which is completely fabricated. The rightists also said: The Communist Party holds the knife handle in the hands of its own people, that is, in the hands of worker-peasant cadres, but in judicial organs, many are neighborhood cadres, housewives, and old judicial personnel. Take our Yulin District Court as an example, among the more than ten judges, seven or eight are non-Party members and from other backgrounds, not all of them are worker-peasant cadres. As for whether cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds can be competent for judicial work? She said: Two of our court presidents are from worker backgrounds. Under the Party's cultivation in the past few years, they have made rapid progress and become judicial workers with a high level of professional skills. As for the arrangement of intellectuals, among our court, there are seven university graduates, four of whom are engaged in judicial work. The lowest level is the 23rd grade. The rightists said that they are always restricted to the 25th grade, which is really nonsense. All of these are sufficient to prove that the rightists are deliberately fabricating rumors and slandering. She also criticized the title of the news report on the Democratic League Judicial Work Symposium published in the *Xinmin Evening News* on May 19, "Walls" High, "Gullies" Deep", saying that if it is really as the title says that the walls are high and the gullies are deep, then it means that the judicial sector is divided, which is not in accordance with the facts. The internal unity of the court has always been to work hard to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

Worker-Peasant Judicial Cadres Have Many Advantages; Denying Their Contributions is a Reluctant Argument

Ye Kexin of the First Legal Advisory Office said: Based on my contact in my work, the vast majority of worker-peasant cadres are loyal and serve the people wholeheartedly. They have many advantages: their class position is stable, their views are clear; their work enthusiasm is high, and they can conduct in-depth investigation and research; they fully embody policies and handle cases well. They have played a significant role in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Denying their contributions is a reluctant argument. Hua Defang of the Second Intermediate People's Court said: The rightists want to pull worker-peasant judicial cadres off the front line of the people's democratic dictatorship. The method they adopt is to provoke the relationship between intellectuals and cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds and undermine unity. They put forward a so-called "employment" plan, only talking about talent and not about morality, which is a conspiracy.

The Rumor About Wrongly Judged 34% of Cases Should Be Further Investigated

Everyone believes that the content of the Democratic League Municipal Committee's judicial work symposium reported by the *Xinmin Evening News* and *Xinwen Daily* in mid-May is mostly untrue. Everyone believes that some people's speeches at that symposium were echoing the rightists' remarks and spreading rumors, which have caused a very bad influence among the masses.

Cai Mingbiao pointed out that someone in the *Xinwen Daily* report said that "34% of the cases in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were wrongly judged." He is a judge of the criminal court and also participated in the work of inspecting cases this time. The court's wrongly judged cases are only individual cases. As for this figure, it is obviously fabricated out of thin air. Liu Heping, who said this, also admitted in the newspaper yesterday that "there is no basis" and that "it was heard from others." We want to ask where it was heard from? Who said it? Because of this rumor, some people have misunderstood the sacred national judicial organ of the People's Court to some extent. The families of counter-revolutionary elements are certainly more dissatisfied. The rightists such as Huang Shaohong are setting fires everywhere to deny the movement to suppress and eliminate counter-revolutionaries. This rumor has become a witness of the rightists. He suggested that the real motives of these rumor-mongers' words and deeds should be further investigated.

The Erroneous Reporting of the *Xinmin Evening News* Created an Opportunity for the Rightists to Attack the Court

Tong Jiefan of the Civil Division of the Higher People's Court said that now many families of counter-revolutionary elements and families of criminal offenders come to appeal, saying that the cases were wrongly judged. They put the *Xinmin Evening News* of May 19 under their appeals as their "basis." In fact, their appeals are wrong, and our judgments are correct. But this shows the adverse impact of this report, creating an opportunity for the rightists to attack the People's Court, and increasing a lot of unnecessary work for us. I hope that the newspaper can cooperate with our court in the future to do more publicity on law and discipline, educate the people to abide by socialist law and discipline, and expose the conspiracies and tricks of the rightists. Dong Jingzhi of the Justice Bureau also hoped in his speech that the *Xinmin Evening News* would vigorously publicize the socialist rule of law and severely refute the rightists' reactionary fallacies.

The Current Stable Social Order Demonstrates the Great Achievements of the Elimination of Counter-Revolutionaries

Ye Kexin of the First Legal Advisory Office said: Someone spread rumors that the court wrongly judged 34% of the cases in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, which is a complete fabrication. I am a lawyer personally, and I have not found such a fact in the cases I have contacted. The judicial organs have powerfully suppressed the enemy and defended the construction of socialism according to policies and laws. The current stable social order demonstrates the great achievements of the elimination of counter-revolutionaries and proves the superiority of the socialist legal system. The rightists spread rumors, which only exposed their ulterior motives. Furthermore, even in the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries, there are very few wrongly judged cases, but the government has been or is processing them in accordance with the spirit of correcting mistakes when they are made. This is the spirit of the people's law being responsible to the people. The rightists' fallacies that have produced adverse effects should be severely refuted. Zheng Zhongcheng of the First Intermediate People's Court said: The rightists said that the error rate of the First Intermediate People's Court in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the community was 34%. I work in the First Intermediate People's Court, but I have never seen or heard of such a percentage. This figure is baseless and certainly not a fact. Why do some people say things off the cuff? Is this also helping the Party to rectify the work style?

The *Xinmin Evening News* Editorial Department Accepts Criticism and is Determined to Correct Mistakes

At the end of the symposium, Liang Weidong, a member of the editorial board of the *Xinmin Evening News*, representing the *Xinmin Evening News* editorial department, expressed his acceptance of everyone's criticism of the *Xinmin Evening News*'s report on the Democratic League Judicial Workers Symposium on May 19. The *Xinmin Evening News* did not distinguish between the rightists' reactionary remarks when publishing this report, which caused adverse effects, and we should be responsible for this. Liang Weidong said: The *Xinmin Evening News* will combine the recent reporting inspection work, deeply inspect the serious bourgeois thoughts in news reporting, earnestly improve future work, and resolutely launch a struggle against the rightists' reactionary words and deeds. Liang Weidong also pointed out that when the members of the Democratic League's judicial work system gathered on June 19 and 20, they talked about the fact that the *Xinmin Evening News*'s report on May 19 had exaggerated and exaggerated. This needs to be explained: The report on that symposium was written by a comrade from the Propaganda Department of the Democratic League Municipal Committee. We did not verify the facts and published the manuscript, which we should be responsible for.

    新民报检查报道民盟司法座谈会的错误
    上海司法工作者揭露右派进攻司法工作的阴谋
    本报讯　上海新民报消息：为了批驳最近一个时期来右派分子对于司法工作的各种反动言行、和征求司法界对新民报宣传报道工作中的缺点、错误的批评意见，新民报编辑部在6月24日邀请了上海一部分司法工作者举行座谈会。
    司法工作者一致表示，毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲话全文发表后，对于我们建设社会主义和正确处理人民内部矛盾都有极大的指导意义，讲话中提出的六项政治标准，是我们明辨大是大非，和右派分子斗争的有力武器。司法工作者学习讲话后，更加明确了人民内部矛盾的性质、人民民主专政的范围和自己的责任。
    司法工作者座谈时，就法制问题、对司法改革的一些看法、对知识分子的使用和工农干部行使审判权等问题，热烈发言，同时对右派分子的种种造谣诬蔑和反社会主义阴谋予以坚决驳斥和揭发。
    司法工作的巨大成绩有目共睹，右派分子的诬蔑有恶毒阴谋
    上海市高级人民法院冯尔泰谈了人民法院在其他司法机关配合下和广大人民的协助下所取得的巨大成绩；揭发了右派分子黄绍竑、谭惕吾等借人民代表名义在上海进行的反社会主义阴谋活动。市高级人民法院王容海说，人民法院是人民民主专政的一个工具。本市各级人民法院和全国各地人民法院一样，依靠群众，配合公安、检察等部门，依据国家政策法令惩办了反革命和各种刑事犯罪分子，解决了许多人民内部的民事纠纷事件，成绩是巨大的，这是有目共睹的事实。近年来刑事案件大大减少，法律秩序日益巩固，我们的法制正在随着社会的发展进步，不断健全和发展。目前国家的立法工作，在刑、民法典的制定方面，是还没有把既有政策、单行法、法令和阶级斗争、生产、生活的实践经验，使之进一步系统化和条文化起来，社会上有人对此提出意见和要求是善意和可以理解的，但少数右派分子如黄绍竑、王造时等却利用这种情况，渲染成为我们“不讲法制”、“没有法制”，并乘机向司法工作进攻。把司法工作中的个别缺点夸大成为全面，说司法机关有法不依，有法乱依，侵犯人权，说得一团糟！杨兆龙提出他的立法路线，实际是要我们沿用伪六法；王造时说中国现在是“人治”不是法治。右派分子的阴谋是企图在中国建立资产阶级的“民主政治”，这是徒劳的。王容海认为必须把我们的立法路线与杨兆龙的立法路线区别开来；把我们的社会主义法制与王造时的“人治”观点区别开来；把我们的“有反必肃，有错必纠”与黄绍竑的为反革命分子说话，说“肃反错了”区别开来。我们要坚决与右派分子关于司法工作的荒谬言论划清界线，展开斗争。
    新民报登载民盟司法座谈会上一些人的发言是荒谬透顶的毁谤性言论
    市第二中级人民法院蔡明标指出，5月19日新民报所登民盟司法座谈会上李国机所说“现在的审判员都可以随便立法，要怎样判就怎样判。”据报纸报道有人说“目前还有草菅人命的昏官”，都是荒谬透顶的毁谤性的言论，已经引起法院工作同志极大愤怒。他说，尽管解放后由于政治形势迅速发展，和客观条件限制，未曾制订整套法律，但实际上人民政府已公布了许多法令、条例，在组织上也都是依法行使审判权的，他责问：身为人民律师的李国机，难道这些情况也不了解？散布挑衅言行用意何在？第二法律顾问处的林景仰说：右派分子杨兆龙在一篇文章里用许多荒谬论点来污蔑我国没有法治，实际上就是污蔑我国没有民主，也就是污蔑我们的社会主义。司法局的董敬之从审判实践中的陪审制度这一事实，说明了我国是有法治的。他说：人民的审判工作是认真地、坚决地按照中华人民共和国宪法和中华人民共和国人民法院组织法的各项规定进行的，从而体现了审判工作的合法性；同时，还体现了人民当家作主的优越性。例如，我们法院固定轮值陪审员已发展到八千二百余人（临时邀请的不计在内），这些人民陪审员不仅完全通过人民直接选举产生，而且是来自各阶层的。第一审案件除了简单的民事案件，轻微的刑事案件和法律另有规定的案件以外，现在已全部实行人民陪审制度，人民陪审员和审判员不论调查和判决都享有同等的权利。高级人民法院民庭的童介凡就这个问题发表意见说，在民事案件中，最多的是婚姻、债务与房屋，而在处理这些案件时，从1949年以来，政府曾陆续颁布了婚姻法，新解放区农村债务纠纷处理办法，私营企业暂行条例与有关公私合营企业定股定息和清产核资等办法、和取缔高利贷与二房东的非法剥削，保护房屋业主合法利益的政策等，这些法律和政策，都是我们审判工作的依据，怎么能说是“无法可依”呢？
    榆林区法院孙世乐说：右派分子说：“无法可依，有法不依，有法乱依”完全是污蔑，如果真如右派分子所讲的那样，社会秩序早已大乱了。事实上我们有法可依，政策、法律、命令、条例，不正是“法”吗？不知道右派分子所指的法到底是什么法，是不是就是资本主义国家的那一套所谓法，看来他们对人民的法律，是不当法律看待的。再说，右派分子说有法不依，好像审判员权很大，而事实上审判工作是和陪审员在上级、群众和其他机关的监督下进行的，审判员又如何能随心所欲呢？她愤怒表示要右派分子站出来在人民的报纸上把问题谈清楚。第一法律顾问处叶克信说：右派分子利用整风机会，向党进攻，说我们的法制不好，察其用意，就是要把我们的法制引导到反对人民民主专政的美国式的资本主义法律的道路上去，我们坚决不能容忍。江宁区人民法院张梦飞说：右派分子另一种谬论，就是说我们过去搞司法改革搞坏了。事实是怎样的呢？在旧法观点没有经过司法改革的批判以前，许多人员处理案件在立场、观点、方法上有问题，比如说，我在南区分庭实习时，就看到为了钱债官司，审判员不分析研究，一天扣押了三十多个人，这明显地说明了旧法观点的弊害，不改又怎么能行呢？
    右派分子妄想把工农干部一棍子打死
    大家批驳“知识分子被‘利用、限制、改造’”的谬论时说，党没有亏待知识分子，而且绝大部分的知识分子都拥护党。右派分子散布所谓“知识分子在被利用、限制、改造”的谬论是把知识分子拉到他们那一边，来反对党，但广大爱国知识分子是会明辨是非的，右派分子是白费心机。蔡明标说，我就是一个学生出身的知识分子，1954年从华东政法学院毕业后，组织分配我在市人民法院工作，为了使我熟悉审判业务，我先担任了一年多书记员，庭的领导和主任书记员在业务上处处关怀、帮助我，组长还订了培养计划（这是我后来被任命为助理审判员时才知道的）。任助审员后，在业务上碰到许多困难，案件把握不定，工作计划忙乱，庭长和周围的党员同志都为我想办法，提出改进工作的意见。凡此种种，我在日常工作中只感到是在受党培养；也感到自己在为祖国社会主义建设贡献一分力量，根本不感到是在被“利用”被“限制”。蔡明标还批评那次民盟召开的座谈会上，有人丑化工农干部说“字都识不了几个的人就可以当审判员”、“如果离开了书记员就无法进行审判工作”、“审判员不会写判决书现在是一种普遍现象”等等谬说。他说有一小部分工农干部文化程度较低是事实，但决不是什么“普遍现象”，工农干部有许多优点是值得知识分子好好学习的，知识分子和工农干部在一道为社会主义事业工作，可以互相帮助，互相提高。右派分子蓄意夸大缺点，是想把工农干部一棍子打死，把他排挤出人民法院，散布这种谬论的人应该查查自己的立场！
    否定司法改革的伟大成就是右派分子的阴谋
    市高级人民法院梅尔和以自己的切身体会说明从法院来看，是正确贯彻了对知识分子“团结、教育、改造”方针的。他说，他自己从前是旧司法工作人员，解放后在党的教育下，努力自我改造，现在还是担任审判工作。他谈到解放初期司法改革时有一批司法工作人员调到别的工作岗位上去，他认为，如果我们能联系当时阶级斗争的情况来看，这样做是完全对的，这些同志几年来都在其他工作岗位上安心工作。右派分子杨兆龙在报上发表文章，说这是党的“宗派主义”，完全是胡说。经过司法改革，不但纯洁了组织，批判了旧法观点，还划清新旧的思想界限。否定司法改革的伟大成就是右派分子的阴谋，我们要予以坚决驳斥。
    右派分子为什么不强调法律的阶级性？他们的目的是要工人阶级放下专政的武器
    第二法律顾问处的林景仰说，李国机说知识分子被“限制”在二十五级，实际上他自己就是二十一级。他所谈的那些人，也没有一个是二十五级的。拿我这个知识分子来说，1954年从华东政法学院毕业后，参加司法机关工作，一直很愉快。我过去是二十二级，现在是二十一级。和我一同由学校出来的十二个人，现在在二十三级以下的，一个也没有。有些人明明知道这些事实，为什么要讲那些话呢？这显然是别有用心。司法局的董敬之说，杨兆龙一方面强调法律的科学性和技术性，一方面强调工农干部文化水平低，不懂法律，这种说法不仅是对工农干部的侮蔑，而且是企图要工人阶级放下专政的武器。如果不是，为什么不强调法律的阶级性呢！事实上，工农干部的文化水平并不是像这些人所说的那样低，对法律也不是一窍不通的。如果把个别写判决书有困难的审判员来概括全面，是不符事实的，这样反而挑拨了工农干部与知识分子的团结。对于工农干部与知识分子的培养，各级党政和司法业务部门采取了各项措施。例如：?每年抽调一定数量干部到中央政法干部学校和上海市司法干部训练班轮流学习法律理论和政策业务；?组织部分在职干部参加上海政法学院函授部学习法律科学；?对其余的在职干部经常举办定期法律理论基础知识讲座和业务报告会，进行系统的法律理论和业务学习；?极少数文化程度浅的还参加了本市各级党委所办的业余补习学校学习文化。律师协会的李树棠说，作为民盟的成员之一，我对右派分子的恶毒毁谤，感到愤慨。解放前我是学旧法律的，解放后我担任了三年的审判员，现在当律师，党对我一直是很信任的。其他大学毕业生当审判员的也很多，事实俱在，怎么能说党对知识分子是“利用、限制、改造”呢？
    法院对工农干部和知识分子的培养，都收到很大效果
    高级人民法院民庭的童介凡说，我是大学法律系的毕业生，是1950年参加法院工作的非党干部，我感到党对我的培养、教育与使用是恰当的。讲到“职”与“级”，我现在是审判员，没有党员审判员的“级”比我更高的。整个法院对干部的培养，不分工农干部与知识分子，都订有计划，并收到了很大的效果。因为几年来我担任审判组长，我经常受到培养，也经常帮助别人。直到今天，这种工作还在进行。提篮桥区人民法院的华卯生说，我是1952年大学毕业到法院工作的，1953年我就调做了助理审判员，今年调做审判员，这说明党是很重视我这个知识分子。我认为，党对我最大的重视，就在从政治上来关心我们。第一法律顾问处周世毓在书面发言中说，党和政府一向很重视和关怀知识分子，但知识分子也有弱点，有不少是剥削阶级家庭出身，带来许多非无产阶级思想，因此必须进行思想改造，解放几年来我们知识分子经过思想改造，有了很大的提高，在司法机关有不少同志先后入了党。
    榆林区法院孙世乐说：右派分子诬蔑工农干部不会写判决书是普遍现象，但在我们法院里就没有一个不会写判决书的工农干部。在全市范围内，或许有个别的，但右派分子却说成是普遍的，那完全是捏造事实。右派分子又说：共产党把刀把子捏在自己人手里，即工农干部手里，可是在司法机关里有不少是里弄干部、家庭妇女和旧司法人员，就拿我们榆林区法院来说，十多个审判员中有七、八个是非党员和其他出身的，并不是全是工农干部。至于说工农出身的干部是不是能胜任审判工作呢？她说：我们法院里有两位庭长是工人出身的，几年来在党的培养下，进步很快，成为具有较高业务水平的司法工作者。至于知识分子的安排，在我们法院中、大学毕业的知识分子有七个人，其中四个人担任了审判工作，级别最低的是二十三级，右派分子说永远被限制在二十五级，真是胡说八道，这些都足以证明右派分子是别有用心的造谣中伤。她还对新民报5月19日所登载的民盟司法工作座谈会新闻的标题“‘墙’高‘沟’深”提出批评，她说：如果真像标题那样墙高沟深，那就意味着司法界内部四分五裂，这与事实不符。法院内部始终是团结一致为巩固人民民主专政而努力工作的。
    工农司法干部的优点很多，否定他们的贡献是违心之论
    第一法律顾问处叶克信说：根据我工作中的接触，极大部分工农干部忠心耿耿为人民服务，他们有很多优点：阶级立场稳定，观点明确；工作积极性高，能深入调查研究；体现政策全面，办案好。他们在巩固人民民主专政中起了重大作用，否定他们的贡献是违心之论。第二中级人民法院华德芳说：右派分子想把工农司法干部从人民民主专政的阵线上拉下去，他们采用的方法是挑拨知识分子和工农出身干部间的关系，破坏团结。他们提出了所谓“用人”的方案，只讲才，不讲德，这是个阴谋。
    关于错判34％案件的谣传，应该进一步查究
    大家认为5月中旬新民报和新闻日报报道的民盟市委召开司法工作座谈会的内容，绝大部分是不真实的。大家认为那次座谈会有些人的发言是随声附和右派言论，传播谣言，已经在群众中造成很坏的影响。
    蔡明标指出，新闻日报报道中有人说“镇反案件错判的占34％”。他是刑庭的审判人员，这次也参加检查案件工作，法院错判案件只是个别的。至于这个数字显然是无中生有，说这话的刘和平昨天也在报上承认“是没有根据的”，“是听来的”，我们要问到底是哪里听来的？听谁讲的？由于这个谣传，已造成了部分人民群众对人民法院这个神圣的国家审判机关在某些程度上的误解。反革命分子家属当然更为不满，黄绍竑等右派分子在到处放火否定镇反、肃反运动，这种谣传已成为右派分子的证人。他建议应进一步追查这些造谣分子言行的真实动机是什么？
    新民报错误的报道，造成右派分子向法院进攻的机会
    高级人民法院民庭童介凡说，现在有许多反革命分子的家属和刑事犯罪分子的家属前来申诉，说案子判错了，他们把5月19日的新民报放在申诉书下面，作为他们的“根据”。事实上，他们的申诉是错误的，我们的判决是正确的。但由此看出这一报道所造成的不良影响，给右派分子造成了向人民法院进攻的机会，为我们增加了许多不必要的工作。希望报纸今后能配合我们法院多做些法纪宣传工作，教育人民遵守社会主义法纪，揭露右派分子的阴谋诡计。司法局的董敬之在发言中也希望新民报大量宣传社会主义的法治，严厉驳斥右派分子的反动谬论。
    现在社会秩序这样安定说明肃反工作重大成就
    第一法律顾问处叶克信说：有人造谣说，法院镇反案件错判34％，这完全是捏造的事实，我个人是律师，在我接触的案件中，就没有发现这样的事实。司法机关根据政策法令，有力地镇压了敌人，保卫了社会主义的建设，现在社会秩序这样安定，正说明了肃反工作的重大成就，证明了社会主义法制的优越性。右派分子造谣，正暴露了他们别有用心而已。再说，即使在肃反工作中，有极个别的错判案件，但政府已根据有错必纠的精神，已经或正在进行处理，这正是人民法律对人民负责的精神，右派分子此种产生不良影响的谬论，应严加驳斥。第一中级人民法院郑钟澄说：右派分子说第一中级人民法院在社会镇反案件中错误率达34％。我是在第一中级人民法院工作的，却从来没有看到或听到过这样的百分比。这个数字是毫无根据的，肯定不是事实。为什么有人要信口乱说呢，这难道也是在帮助党整风吗？
    新民报编辑部接受批评决心改正错误
    座谈结束时，新民报编委梁维栋代表新民报编辑部表示接受大家对于新民报5月19日民盟司法工作者座谈会报道的批评。新民报在刊登这篇报道时，对于右派反动言论，不加辨别，以致造成不良影响，我们应该负责。梁维栋说：新民报将结合最近的报道检查工作，深入检查新闻报道中的严重资产阶级思想，切实改进今后工作，坚决与右派反动言行展开斗争。梁维栋还指出，6月19、20日民盟司法工作系统盟员集会时，谈到5月19日新民报的报道有渲染夸大之处，这一点需要说明：那次座谈会的报道是民盟市委宣传部一位同志写的，我们未核对事实，就把稿件发表，是应该负责的。
