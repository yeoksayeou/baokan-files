    Ruthless Mirror
    Liang Ruhai
    The twentieth anniversary of the July 7th Incident coincides with the high tide of the nationwide anti-Rightist struggle. Looking back, it is truly filled with emotions.
    These twenty years have been dazzling and earth-shattering. Twenty years, history has spanned many centuries! How many changes have the world experienced!
    Twenty years ago, the young people who marched to the front lines to resist Japan and save the nation, many of them have now become the backbone of socialist construction. Twenty years ago, the intellectuals who walked out of their studies, some have been tempered and strengthened in the storms of the times; some have been left behind by the train of the times.
    Twenty years, for many people in the past, it was a great furnace of transformation and steelmaking.
    Twenty years, for today's rightists, it is a ruthless mirror.
    Isn't it? Those who once vociferously resisted Japan and saved the country, today dream of using weak hands to stop the wheels of history, conspire to plunder the fruits of victory bought with the blood of millions, and attempt to overthrow the Communist Party that led the Chinese people to defeat Japanese imperialism and the three major enemies. As the twentieth anniversary of the July 7th Incident approaches, if they have not been completely blinded by greed, what are their thoughts?
    The great river flows eastward, washing away countless historical figures. Twenty years is not a long time. The rightists on the edge of the cliff should wake up.

    无情的镜子
    梁汝怀
    七七事变的第二十周年，正值全国人民反右派斗争的高潮，抚今思昔，确实令人感慨系之。
    这二十年，是令人目眩神摇的二十年，是天翻地复的二十年。二十年，历史跨越了多少世纪！人世经历几多变化！
    二十年前高歌着走上抗日救亡前线的年青人，今天许多都成为建设社会主义的中坚。二十年前走出书房的知识分子，今天有的在时代的风暴中锻炼得坚强；有的已经被时代的列车抛在后面。
    二十年，对过去的许多人说，是脱胎换骨、炼铁成钢的大洪炉。
    二十年，对今天的右派分子说，是一面无情的镜子。
    不是么？当年曾经口口声声抗日救国的，今天却梦想用微弱的双手阻住历史车轮，却阴谋掠夺千千万万人用鲜血换来的胜利果实，却企图推翻领导中国人民打倒日本帝国主义、打倒三大敌人的共产党。临到七七事变二十周年，如果还没有完全利令智昏，不知他们有何感想？
    大江东去，浪淘尽千古风流人物。二十年，时间不算长，走到悬崖的边缘上的右派人物应当清醒了。
