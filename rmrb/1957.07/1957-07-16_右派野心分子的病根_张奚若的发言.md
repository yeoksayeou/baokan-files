Why, in the face of the glorious achievements of the country in the eight years since liberation, when everyone is delighted and celebrating, are rightist ambitionists filled with resentment, not only ignoring these achievements but also wanting to overthrow the people's regime that created them? Why must they be so disagreeable with the broad masses of the people? Why must they "hate what good people like and like what bad people like"?

Generally speaking, this is entirely a matter of class stand. Different class stands lead to different views; different class stands often make it impossible to have the same likes and dislikes. This is a re-emergence of the old question of "terrible mess" versus "very good."

This is not surprising. What is strange is that these ambitionists, after eight years of study, work, life, and influence, still stubbornly maintain their original bourgeois stand. Some people say that even without study, the frequent contact with the broad masses of the people and national leaders over the past eight years should have instilled some Marxist-Leninist atmosphere and people's standpoint thinking. How could they still have that face and that heart? This seems to prove only one thing: these rightist ambitionists are die-hard elements of the Chinese bourgeoisie.

Because rightist ambitionists refuse to abandon their bourgeois stand, their views on everything today differ from ours. We say that the working people are the masters of the country, but they believe this is a violation of physics, putting the cart before the horse; in their view, nothing is more unfair than this. In their hearts, they still hold to the idea that "those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others.” We believe in collectivism, while they worship individualism. We have implemented New Democracy, while they long for the old democracy. We have entered a socialist society, while they want to return to a capitalist society. We thank the Communist Party, while they hate the Communist Party, because in their view, all bad things are done by the Communist Party, the worst of which is eliminating their class, damaging their interests, and constantly advising them to join the working class, which they despise the most. In their view, this is nothing less than "insult added to injury"! Therefore, they recruit troops, deploy forces, secretly plot, and publicly ignite fires, everything comes.

Although the unchanged class stand is the fundamental reason for the reactionary behavior of rightist ambitionists, it is not the only reason. In addition to this primary cause, there are several secondary causes, which can also be called contributing factors. These contributing factors vary from person to person and are not uniform. Some have too deep a political habit, some have too heavy a rogue style; some have insatiable desires, always pursuing fame and wealth, some have wild ideas, forcing unreasonable and bizarre arguments; some are unwilling to be lonely, why not speculate, some are fond of chaos, even wanting to rebel. Some of these problems have only one or two, while others not only have all of them but also add others. According to the law of development of bad people and bad deeds, these people eventually become blinded by greed, daydream, suffer a stroke and run madly, and throw themselves into the net. Who among today's rightist ambitionists such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and Chu Anping is not like this?

Originally, in the old society, the profession of a politician was to be fickle, to reverse black and white, to engage in both vertical and horizontal alliances, and to reward deception as illusion. All support and opposition lacked moral standards, and all thoughts and actions were ultimately aimed at gaining personal benefits or power. This was commonplace in the old society, but it is shocking in today's society. Please tell me, if this continues, where will the interests of the people and the future of the country be placed? Isn't this dragging New China back to the old path of Old China? Yes, the purpose of the rightist ambitionists is precisely this. It is no wonder that we have become irreconcilable with them today. This is an inevitable conflict between two different positions, and this is the inevitable result of the transformation of contradictions among the people into contradictions between ourselves and the enemy.

According to the facts recently revealed, the development process of this reactionary behavior of rightist ambitionists is considerably related to their misunderstanding and utilization of the "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" policy announced last year. Before this, they were only dissatisfied and cursed behind their backs. After this, they suddenly felt open-minded and beaming with joy, thinking that they could accomplish great things. Originally, the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," like the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," was adopted to "mobilize all positive factors to build a socialist society." It was not adopted for the sake of coexistence for the sake of coexistence, or for the sake of speaking out for the sake of speaking out, let alone to provide convenience for others to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose the socialist road. However, those who harbor ulterior motives and look at things with colored glasses see things differently from others. Others believe that this is a wise and great policy for building a socialist society, while they believe that this is a great opportunity to be equal with the Communist Party or to stand up to it. From then on, their activities increased, their organizations expanded, and their steps accelerated. Coincidentally, the Communist Party's rectification movement began in May of this year, and these people believed that "the time is now or never," so they beat drums and lit fires everywhere. Even the secret planners even believed that the Communist Party "cannot accept them, nor can it use force, who else but me can clean up the mess!" Unexpectedly, a good dream, sweet for less than a month, after the Party and the government and the broad masses of the people began a powerful "counter-criticism" and "counterattack" against the rampant attack of the rightists, within a few days, these imaginary castles in the air disappeared without a trace, leaving only some sighs of regret, complaints and scolding, and a pitiful appearance of wanting to surrender but not surrendering.

I want to solemnly warn these rightist ambitionists: you are blinded by greed, daydream, and engaged in an anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy. Now is the time to wash your hearts and faces, and thoroughly correct your past mistakes. I hope you can sincerely repent, honestly confess, and start a new life. Trying to muddle through is not only impossible, but even the past will still be a problem. The people will not be deceived, and those who suffer will still be yourselves. The problem now facing you is very simple: one is to repent and accept transformation, and the other is to resist transformation and isolate oneself from the people. The right and wrong, advantages and disadvantages between the two are very clear. Is there any room for hesitation about which way to go?

    右派野心分子的病根
    张奚若的发言
    为甚么在解放后八年来国家各种辉煌成就的面前，人人欢欣鼓舞庆赏不已，而右派野心分子竟然心怀忿恨，不但无视这些成就，而且还要推翻造成这些成就的人民政权呢？他们为甚么一定要和广大人民这样过不去呢？他们为甚么一定要“好人之所恶，恶人之所好”呢？
    总的说来，这完全是一个阶级立场问题。阶级立场不同，看法就不同；阶级立场不同，好恶也就常常无法相同。这又是“糟得很，好得很”那个老问题的重新出现。
    这本来不足为奇。奇怪的是：这些野心分子经过八年的学习、工作、生活、熏淘，结果还是这样顽梗不化地保持着原来的资产阶级立场。有人说，就是不讲学习，光就八年来与广大人民和国家领导同志的时常接触来说，感染也应感染上几分马列主义气息和人民立场思想，何至竟然还是那副面孔和那种心肠呢？这似乎只能证明一点，就是：这些右派野心分子是中国资产阶级的死硬派。
    因为右派野心分子不肯放弃他们的资产阶级立场，所以他们对今天的一切事情就都和我们的看法不同了。我们说劳动人民当家作主了，他们认为这是违反物理，本末倒置；在他们看来，天下最不公平的事情莫过于此。他们心里还是“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”那一套。我们相信集体主义，他们崇拜个人主义。我们实行了新民主，他们留恋着旧民主。我们已进入社会主义社会，他们想回到资本主义社会。我们感谢共产党，他们仇恨共产党，因为在他们看来一切坏事情都是共产党干的，其中最坏的就是消灭了他们的阶级、破坏了他们的利益，而且还不断地劝告他们要加入他们最瞧不起的那工人阶级。在他们看来，这无异是“伤害之上加侮辱”！因此，他们便招兵买马，调兵遣将，秘密策划，公开点火，一切一切都来了。
    阶级立场未变一点虽然是右派野心分子发生反动行为的基本原因，但它并不是唯一的原因。这个主因而外，还有若干次要的原因，这些次要的原因也可叫做副因。这些副因是因人而异，并不一律。有的是政客习气太深，有的是流氓作风太重；有的是欲壑难填，永远追求名利，有的是异想天开，强作无理怪论；有的是不甘寂寞，何妨投机，有的是好乱成性，竟欲造反。这些毛病，有的只具一二，有的不但全部皆有，还要再加别的。按照坏人坏事发展的规律，这些人到头来就弄到利令智昏，想入非非，中风狂走，自投网罗。试问今日的章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平等右派野心分子谁不是这样？
    本来在旧社会里政客的职业就是要朝三暮四，颠倒黑白，纵横捭阖，酬张为幻。一切拥护反对毫无道德标准，一切思想行为皆以博取个人利益或权力为最终目的。这在旧社会本是司空见惯的事情，但在今日却属骇人听闻的行径。请问这样搞下去，将置人民利益国家前途于何地，岂不是又要把新中国拉回到旧中国的老路上去？是的，右派野心分子的目的本来如此。这就难怪今日我们同他们变成势不两立了。这是两个不同立场的无可避免的冲突，这是人民内部矛盾转变成敌我矛盾的必然结果。
    右派野心分子这种反动行为的发展过程，据最近揭露出来的事实看，是与他们误会和利用去年宣布的“长期共存、互相监督”的政策有相当关系的。在这以前，他们只是心怀不满，背后骂娘罢了。在这以后，他们忽然觉得心胸开朗，眉飞色舞，以为可以大有所为了。本来“长期共存、互相监督”的政策和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策一样，都是为了“调动一切积极因素建设社会主义社会”而采取的，并不是为了共存而共存，为了鸣放而鸣放，更不是为了给别人提供反对共产党的领导和反对社会主义道路的便利而采取的。可是心怀异志和戴着有色眼镜看东西的人所见却与别人不同。别人认为这是为建设社会主义社会的一种英明而伟大的政策，他们却认为这是与共产党平分秋色或分庭抗礼的大好机会。从此他们的活动增加了，组织扩大了，步骤加紧了。碰巧，今年五月共产党的整风运动开始了，这些人认为“时哉不可失”，于是就到处擂鼓，到处点火了。甚至密室策划者竟然还认为共产党“既不能收，又不能用武力，收拾残局，舍我其谁！”不料一天好梦，甜蜜了不到一月，在党和政府及全国广大人民对右派的猖狂进攻开始了有力的“反批评”和“回击”之后，不到数日，这些幻想中的空中楼阁便烟消云散，杳无踪影了，剩下的只是些欷歔太息，埋怨诟詈，欲降不降的可怜样子。
    我要在这里正告这些右派野心分子：你们利令智昏，想入非非，搞了一场反党反社会主义的勾当，现在已是洗心革面、痛改前非的时候了。我希望你们能虔诚忏悔，老实交代，重新做人。蒙混过关，不但不行，就是过去，还有问题。人民是不会受骗的，所苦者仍是你们自己。现在摆在你们面前的问题甚为简单：一是憣然悔悟，接受改造，一是抗拒改造，自绝于人民。二者之间的是非利害，一清二楚，何去何从，难道还有任何犹豫的余地吗？
