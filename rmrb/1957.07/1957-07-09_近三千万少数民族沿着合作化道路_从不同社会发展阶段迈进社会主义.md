Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: In the vast majority of ethnic minority regions, farmers and herdsmen of more than forty ethnic minorities are advancing towards socialism along the road of cooperativization, surpassing one or several stages of social development.

To date, among the 35 million ethnic minorities in the country, the regions with nearly 30 million people who completed land reform earlier have basically achieved the socialist transformation of agriculture. The ethnic groups living in these regions include: Zhuang, Hui, Uyghur, Miao, Bouyei, Korean, Mongolian, Manchu, Dong, Bai, Naxi, Yao, Li, Dongxiang, Bonan, Tu, Shui, Salar, Xibe, Russian, Daur, Gelao, Maonan and more than twenty other ethnic groups, as well as the Yi people in inland Yunnan. In these regions, most of the farmers who have joined cooperatives have reached more than 90%, and they basically completed the advanced agricultural cooperativization this spring. Among them, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province had basically achieved agricultural cooperativization before 1955. Pastoral areas of the Mongolian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Yugur, Solon and other ethnic groups have also gradually carried out animal husbandry cooperativization on the basis of completing democratic reforms, with the number of herding households joining cooperatives generally reaching more than 20% of the total number of herding households.

Ethnic minority regions formerly under feudalism, such as the Dai, Hani, Lahu, and Qiang, and some Yi regions formerly under slavery, have adopted peaceful consultation to carry out democratic reforms, liberating serfs and slaves, equally distributing land, and abolishing feudal and slave system exploitation and privileges. From 1955 to 1956, regions with a population of more than 2.5 million people completed democratic reforms. Among them, the reform of the slavery system has been basically completed. At present, there are only 2 million people in ethnic minority areas across the country, including Tibet, that have not yet undergone reforms. When these regions will reform will be decided by the ethnic minority leaders and the masses themselves.

Regions that have undergone democratic reforms are gradually realizing cooperativization. According to statistics from five regions, including the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (agricultural area) in Sichuan Province, and the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, more than 1,500 agricultural cooperatives have been established after the democratic reforms. Including mutual aid teams, the organized farmers have reached 30% to 60% of the total number of farmers.

Among the ethnic minorities, there are also some with the nature or remnants of clan societies, including the Lisu, Jingpo, Nu, Dulong, Kawa, Oroqen, and other ethnic groups, totaling more than 700,000 people. Some of these regions are in a state of clan communes or primitive tribes, and some have class differentiation but have not yet formed a class society. These regions will no longer undergo democratic reforms. Currently, with the strong help of the state, they are directly transitioning to socialism through mutual aid and cooperation and the development of production. Among them, the Jingpo, Lisu, and Lahu people have tried and established more than 200 agricultural production cooperatives. After most of the Oroqen people settled down, they also organized three hunting and agricultural and pastoral cooperatives and more than 30 mutual aid teams.

The socialist transformation and democratic reforms of all ethnic minorities, when they are carried out, what methods and steps are taken, are all voluntarily decided by the leaders and the people of the ethnic groups, specifically led by the cadres of the ethnic groups, and fully take into account the characteristics of each ethnic group. For example, in some ethnic minority areas, due to differences in economic and cultural development compared with Han areas, the time for cooperativization is generally later than in Han areas, the scale of cooperatives is smaller, and various systems are simpler and easier to understand. When establishing cooperatives in ethnic minority areas and areas with mixed ethnic populations, in addition to strictly adhering to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, special attention is paid to the implementation of ethnic policies.

Regarding the issue of production materials entering the cooperatives, various localities have taken into account the diverse life needs and customs of various ethnic minorities. For example, Mongolian cooperative members retain more livestock to facilitate milking, meat consumption, and horseback riding; Uyghur cooperative members need to retain more orchards to facilitate engagement in household sideline production. Members of the Miao, Dong, Yao, Bouyei and other ethnic groups need to retain Malanpo, Tiaohuapo, maiden fields, indigo fields, ancestral hall land, bride-price cattle, etc., so that young men and women can engage in social entertainment, women can weave cloth to make skirts, or use them for wedding sacrifices and other purposes. Appropriate arrangements have been made for these needs in various places, and efforts have been made to satisfy them. In some areas, the special needs of ethnic minorities were not sufficiently taken into account in the early stages of cooperativization, and after the ethnic minorities raised their opinions, they were also addressed and corrected in the process of cooperative transformation and consolidation.

Democratic reforms in ethnic minority areas have mostly adopted peaceful consultation methods. Before the reform, the ethnic autonomous organs or the People's Government consulted with upper-class figures based on the wishes of the ethnic minority people and public leaders and obtained their consent. During the reform, feudal lords, landlords, slave owners, etc., were given the same share of land, and their surplus houses, grain, farm implements, and draught animals were either left untouched in some areas, or the People's Government purchased them at reasonable prices in some areas and distributed them to poor farmers or slaves. At the same time, political and economic arrangements were made for upper-class figures of various ethnic minorities, so that their positions were no lower than their past official positions, and their living standards were no lower than their past levels. Local governments have appropriately provided assistance to upper-class figures who have not participated in work but have difficulties in their lives.

In the socialist transformation and democratic reforms in ethnic minority areas, the policy of protecting freedom of religious belief was resolutely implemented. During the democratic reforms, the land and creditor's rights of monasteries were left untouched. In individual areas, considering the difficulties of both the masses and the monasteries, the land was left untouched, and the debts owed by the masses to the monasteries were repaid by the People's Government.

### 近三千万少数民族沿着合作化道路  从不同社会发展阶段迈进社会主义

    近三千万少数民族沿着合作化道路
    从不同社会发展阶段迈进社会主义
    新华社8日讯　在全国绝大部分的民族地区，四十多个少数民族的农民和牧民沿着合作化道路，超越一个或几个社会发展阶段，向社会主义迈进。
    到目前为止，全国三千五百万少数民族当中，完成土地改革较早的近三千万人口的地区，都已基本实现了农业社会主义改造。居住在这些地区的民族有：僮、回、维吾尔、苗、布依、朝鲜、蒙古、满、侗、白、纳西、瑶、黎、东乡、保安、土、水、撒拉、锡伯、俄罗斯、达呼尔、仡佬、毛难等二十多个民族，及云南内地的彝族。这些地区入社农户，大都达到90％以上，并且在今年春季基本上完成农业高级合作化。其中，吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州在1955年以前，就已基本实现农业合作化。蒙古、哈萨克、柯尔克孜、塔吉克、裕固、索伦等民族的牧业区，也在完成民主改革的基础上，逐步开展了畜牧业合作化，入社牧户大都达到牧户总数的20％以上。
    原来处于封建社会的傣、哈尼、拉祜、羌等民族地区，和原来处于奴隶社会的部分彝族地区，已采取和平协商的方式进行民主改革，解放了农奴、奴隶，平分了土地，废除了封建制、奴隶制的剥削和特权。从1955年到1956年，已有二百五十多万人口的地区完成了民主改革。其中，对于奴隶制度的改革已基本完成。现在，全国只有二百万人口的少数民族地区，包括西藏在内，还没有进行改革。这些地区何时改革，将由本民族领袖人物和群众自己决定。
    经过民主改革的地区，正在逐步实现合作化。根据云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州、西双版纳傣族自治州、红河哈尼族自治区、四川阿坝藏族自治州（农业区）、凉山彝族自治州等五个地区的统计，民主改革后已建立起一千五百多个农业社，连同互助组在内，组织起来的农户已达农户总数的30％到60％。
    少数民族当中，还有一部分带有氏族社会的性质或残余的，包括傈僳、景颇、怒、独龙、佧佤、鄂伦春等民族共七十多万人口的地区，有的处于氏族村社、原始部落状态，有的有了阶级分化但尚未形成阶级社会。这类地区不再经过民主改革，目前正在国家大力帮助下，通过互助合作和发展生产，直接向社会主义过渡。其中景颇、傈僳、拉祜等族人民，已试办和建立了二百多个农业生产合作社。鄂伦春人大部定居后，也组织起了三个猎业和农牧业合作社和三十多个互助组。
    各少数民族的社会主义改造和民主改革，在什么时候进行，采取什么方式和步骤，都是由本民族领袖人物和人民群众自愿决定，由本民族的干部具体领导，并充分照顾了各民族的特点。如有些少数民族地区，由于经济、文化的发展情况和汉族地区有差别，因此合作化的时间一般比汉族地区较晚，合作社的规模较小，各种制度更为简单易懂。民族地区和民族杂居区办社，除更加严格地坚持自愿互利原则外，特别重视民族政策的贯彻。
    在生产资料入社问题上，各地照顾了各少数民族多种多样的生活需要和风俗习惯。如蒙古族社员自留牲畜比较多，使吃奶、食肉和乘马方便；维吾尔社员需要自留较多的果园，便于从事家庭副业生产。苗、侗、瑶、布依等民族的社员需要留马郎坡、跳花坡、姑娘田、靛地、祠堂地、财礼牛等，以便青年男女进行社交娱乐、妇女织布作裙或作为婚礼祭祀等用途。对于这些需要，各地都作了适当安排，尽量给以满足。有些地区合作化初期照顾少数民族特殊需要不够，经少数民族人民提出意见后，也在转社、整社中进行了处理和纠正。
    少数民族地区的民主改革，大都采用了和平协商方式。改革前，民族自治机关或人民政府根据少数民族人民群众和公众领袖的意愿，与上层人士进行了协商，取得同意。改革中，对封建领主、地主、奴隶主等，分给同样一份土地，对他们多余的房屋、粮食、农具、耕畜等，有的地区一律不动，有的地区由人民政府以合理价格出钱购买，发给贫苦的农民或奴隶。同时，对各少数民族的上层人士在政治上、经济上作了安排，使他们的职务不低于过去的官职，生活不低于过去的水平。对没有参加工作而生活上有困难的上层人士，各地政府都适当地给以帮助。
    少数民族地区在社会主义改造和民主改革中，仍坚决执行了保护宗教信仰自由的政策。民主改革中对寺院的土地、债权，一律不动，个别地区考虑到群众和寺庙双方的困难，土地不动，群众欠寺庙的债务由人民政府代为偿还。
