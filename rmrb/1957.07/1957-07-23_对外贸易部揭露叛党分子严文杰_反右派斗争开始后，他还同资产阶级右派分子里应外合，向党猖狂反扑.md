Ministry of Foreign Trade Exposes Renegade Yan Wenjie
After the Start of the Anti-Rightist Struggle, He Also Colluded With Bourgeois Rightists to Madly Counterattack the Party

(Our Newspaper) For over a month, all employees of the Ministry of Foreign Trade have been exposing and criticizing Yan Wenjie, a rightist within the Party and Director of the European and American Research Office of the Market Research Institute. Yan Wenjie's anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist face has been exposed to the masses and he is now isolated.

At the end of May and beginning of June, when bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, Yan Wenjie stood on the same side as them and launched a vicious attack on the Party from many directions. In his speeches at Party meetings, in his manuscript to the People's Daily entitled "A Casual Talk on 'Maidservant Pen' and its Prevailing Tendencies" (unpublished), and especially in his lengthy letter of suggestions to the Party Central Committee, he put forward a series of reactionary proposals. He advocated that Party committees below the provincial and municipal levels should not play a leading role.

	He Demanded That a Large Number of Veteran Cadres Be "Removed"

He not only generally opposed the Party's leadership in politics, organization, and ideology, but also put forward absurd proposals regarding the Party's leadership and organizational forms.

He limited the Party's leadership to "socialist orientation and path and major policies and principles." He believed that "only the Party Central Committee and the provincial (municipal) Party committees can play this role, while the prefectural, county, district, township, and enterprise and school Party committees cannot," and that "at the same time, the Party and government each have their own systems, and the political and legal organs, supervision departments, organizations, and enterprises at the same level listen to the Party at the same level, creating duplication," thus forming "Party replacing government or the Party and government not being separated."

He demanded that Party committees below the provincial level and the Party committees of organs, enterprises, and schools "should not act as departments playing a leading role of the Party, but only as ordinary Party affairs departments," and that "it has no power over national work, organ and enterprise affairs, or society and the people," and that "organs, enterprises, and local regimes are only subject to the leadership of the government and the People's Congress."

The purpose of Yan Wenjie's reactionary proposals was clearly to cut the Party's organization in half, empty the Party's higher leading organs, and make it impossible to implement the Party's policies and principles, in essence, to abolish the Party's leadership.

Yan Wenjie believed that a considerable number of middle and lower-level Party cadres (including those equivalent to bureau-level cadres in the central government) were incompetent and relied on their Party membership to make a living. He vilified the Party's middle and lower-level cadres as "ignorant mediocrities." He slandered, saying: "Those whose positions are above others are tongue-tied when it comes to work, or even mess things up." "The best of these people are those who don't play a role, but generally they play a counter role." On the other hand, he believed that "our business is all in the hands of the old personnel and young intellectuals, and these people cannot be promoted due to historical, family, and social relations." He said that this situation had reached a point "that makes people unbearable." He advocated that these middle and lower-level Party members cultivated during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War should be "removed," and that they should be given lifelong living allowances by contracting, and then asked to retire or go to the countryside, or take on simple work, depending on the situation.

In order to achieve the goal of "removing" veteran cadres, Yan Wenjie first discredited and attacked the Party's cadre policy of "both virtue and talent," and deliberately distorted it. He described the cadre policy implemented by the Party in the past as "virtue messing up talent." He said: "At the middle and lower levels, 'talent' has been abandoned, and 'virtue' often becomes a ranking of seniority, years of service, and leadership favor." He believed that in the past, as long as cadres were Party members and had high ranks, they could be reused.

Yan Wenjie further launched a vicious attack on personnel departments. He believed that the cadres in personnel departments were mostly from rural backgrounds, with low levels of knowledge, narrowness, and factionalism. He said: "Those who manage people don't know what people are, and don't recognize other people's knowledge and talent." He believed that personnel departments "treat other people's futures and reputations like child's play." "The Party's prestige will be lost here," and asserted that "the result is likely to be a situation of universal resentment."

He frantically demanded that the central government accept his strategies, saying that personnel issues were the source of "people's dissatisfaction" and the "focus of righteous indignation," and that if they could not be changed according to his opinions, then "the contradictions can never be resolved."

Putting Yan Wenjie's absurd remarks and his other fallacies together, it can be clearly seen that he was merely attempting to drive away Party member cadres who faithfully implemented the Party's and the state's policies from various state organs, enterprises, and schools, so that the personnel departments could not correctly implement the Party's political line and organizational line, and so that the Party's leadership could not be realized. He demanded the cancellation of mass movements and class struggle.

Yan Wenjie viciously slandered movements such as the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries. He said: "People who have personally experienced these movements feel terrified and have goosebumps when they think about them." "At this time, everyone is in danger and society is in great terror." "The injury to people is undoubtedly deep." He also spread rumors, saying: "No matter who, as long as the leader points a finger, they can be struggled against." "The scene of struggle is much more uncomfortable than being in prison." He even openly called out for the already dead feudal forces, and threatened the people: "Think about it, when a victimized peasant rises up to struggle against bullies and landlords, the momentum is like madness, what will those who have been injured do to us when there is a change in the future!" "I think that some people who are not necessarily counter-revolutionary will be forced to become counter-revolutionary."

Because Yan Wenjie was hostile to the people and opposed the struggle against the enemies of the people, he painstakingly proposed ways to abolish mass movements and class struggle. He clamored: "No matter what the results are, this kind of movement cannot be carried out again!" "It is required that the government stipulates: Unless the procuratorate agrees and is accepted and presided over by the court, general organs and groups shall not hold struggle meetings." He also openly proposed to retaliate against comrades who led the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries, saying "those who wrongly killed people should die," and "those who wrongly imprisoned people should be imprisoned." He nakedly expressed his emotions of hatred for the revolution.

Yan Wenjie's purpose was to abolish the people's democratic dictatorship, so that counter-revolutionaries could take advantage of it, to abolish the Party's mass line, and to fantasize about the restoration of the counter-revolution. He slandered that there was no freedom of thought and speech in our country and within the Party.

Yan Wenjie believed that there was no freedom of thought and speech in our country and within the Party. He said: "It is difficult for people to be masters of their own thoughts and words! It seems that they are always led by the nose and restricted to activities within a designated circle."

Yan Wenjie said that the "social reason" for the lack of freedom of thought and speech was that "the ideological and knowledge level of middle and lower-level personnel is low, they cannot think for themselves, they can only look at the nodding, shaking, waving, and pointing from above."

He described the Party's ideological leadership and unified leadership as constraints. He viciously said: "Every place only looks at the Party committee, and the administration, enterprises, newspapers, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League, etc., when the Party committee breathes, thousands of nostrils breathe together, and everyone can only follow suit." "As long as you actively listen to the Party during the movement, you are a good cadre, which makes the minds of many comrades in the Party simple." He viciously slandered articles explaining the works of the leader, saying: "It seems that one article is enough to solve all the theories and work problems in the world." "It seems that in the world today, there is no other knowledge besides this." He also said: "I really don't know why this is necessary? If a person writes something, and so many explanations are needed for people to understand, then that thing is dispensable!"

In order to "open up" thought and speech, he "suggested" that more newspapers should be published, and that they should "have the style of today (referring to the period when rightist elements were frantically attacking the Party and were not being countered for the time being)." Because he believed that newspapers at that time were "really free, with a rich style," and could reflect "public opinion." He said: "With this kind of public opinion, even without rectification, people will be forced to be more careful in doing things, and look at the reactions and surrounding public opinion."

He not only opposed mass movements, but also opposed the leadership of the movement having "a set of policies and principles." He believed that "as soon as the movement comes, everyone has to say yes, even if they see that it is wrong at the time, no one can say anything, and they can only do it blindly," "this has also become a restraint on thinking." He demanded: "Fewer movements, so that people have a richer mind, and don't spend all day in nervous tension."

He opposed the Party's policy of ideological remolding of intellectuals, and openly peddled spontaneity, saying: "All study, reports, and social activities must not use working hours, and participation should be voluntary." "Reports, discussions, etc., do not necessarily correct people," and "things should be said more in the newspapers, so that people can consider and act consciously."

It can be seen that what Yan Wenjie demanded was bourgeois freedom of speech and thought, opposed the Party's ideological leadership and political leadership, thereby undermining the Party's ranks; and when bourgeois ideas were attacking, he demanded that the Party abandon its position on the ideological front, so that capitalism could gain a dominant position in thought. He scolded writers and reporters who praised the Party and the leader as "maidservant roots and servile nature."

In Yan Wenjie's manuscript "A Casual Talk on 'Maidservant Pen' and its Prevailing Tendencies," it can be seen how frantically he despised and insulted the people. He described our social life as pitch black; and the people who lived in this society, "especially writers and reporters," "generate a kind of maidservant root, servile nature."

He wrote: Currently, some people "speak and write, exclusively to flatter" "the insincerity of emotion and the affectation of attitude, listening to it and reading it makes people feel like swallowing feces, vomiting and the intestines come out!" He believes that this is "commonplace" in our lives and has "become a prevailing tendency."

He wrote: "Some writers and reporters, when they mention the leader, must add some 'grateful feelings,' such as 'devout admiration...', 'great', 'simple'.... In addition to being contrived and making people unable to read on, it is inevitable that people will ask what 'roots' and what 'nature' the writer has in mind."

He described the elaboration and promotion of the works of revolutionary leaders in all aspects and their implementation in various tasks as "additional explanations." He advocated not to "hang portraits everywhere and praise them like gods."

He described the relationship between the leader and the led, the leader and the people, and the superior and the subordinate as the relationship between the ruler and the ruled, as the relationship between the "master" and the "slave." He said: "'Maidservant' is the dowry or appendage of 'Grandma'." Everything of the "maidservant" "depends on the favor and disfavor of the grandma," and their spiritual world is "a kind of 'obedience', 'catering', 'flattery', and even the 'maidservant' philosophy of being favored by receiving the saliva of the master."

Yan Wenjie's reactionary article fully exposed his own "roots" and "nature": hating the Party, opposing the revolutionary leader, despising the socialist cause, and being exactly the same "root" as the bourgeois rightists. He openly opposed the anti-rightist struggle, saying that he "disliked" the People's Daily "very much."

After the Party and the people's anti-rightist struggle began, Yan Wenjie recklessly attacked the Party's policies from within and outside the Party, opposed the Party and the people's counterattack against the rightist elements, launched a frenzied counterattack against the Party in collusion with the rightist elements, and stubbornly resisted to the end.

After June 8, the People's Daily published several anti-rightist editorials. On the one hand, Yan Wenjie openly opposed the People's Daily's counterattack against the rightists, and in addition to speaking at Party meetings and sending two manuscripts to the People's Daily, he also sent an "urgent appeal" to the Party Central Committee.

Yan Wenjie clamored that "the encirclement and suppression has begun," "it is a great crusade," "the People's Daily's approach is very clumsy," "if you say that others are rude, the People's Daily is much ruder than others, a hundred times more powerful." He attacked the People's Daily's headlines, saying: "'The people did not entrust Ge Peiqi to say such things,' has it been voted by citizens? I think Ge Peiqi also represents a part of society." "'Notable trends of the China Democratic League' made members of the China Democratic League shudder, as if they were engaged in some secret activities." He described people who criticized the rightists as "insincere, watching the wind and steering the rudder, I doubt whether it is true." These constituted a concept of his: the People's Daily "overdid it," "not clever," "fiery." At this time, he also sang along with the rightist elements to enhance the momentum of the rightist elements. He said: "Why be so petty?" "Did Chu Anping say that big monks and small monks are insulting the leader? I quite appreciate this sentence." "Ge Peiqi said that he would kill Communists, but he didn't say he would kill them now! If the Communist Party is really bad, why not allow others to kill you?" He even howled with the rightist elements outside the Party, "worried," and "disliked very much, very sad" about the People's Daily.

On the other hand, he also openly opposed the Party and the masses' anti-rightist struggle within the Ministry of Foreign Trade. On June 11, the blackboard newspaper of the Ministry of Foreign Trade excerpted the summary of the speech of the rightist element Li Taihua. Yan Wenjie was furious, stood up for the rightist element Li Taihua, and lodged a strong "protest" with the blackboard newspaper in the name of "a member of the Communist Party of China." He knew that the editorial board of the blackboard newspaper was led by the Party, but he "questioned whose idea this was and why?" "I don't think this approach is aboveboard."

All the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Trade were extremely indignant at Yan Wenjie's open anti-Party behavior and raised questions. Yan Wenjie intensified his slander, saying: "It is not allowed to protest something you disagree with, I want to ask 'what kind of world is this'."

Yan Wenjie went to Yan'an in 1938 to participate in the revolution and joined the Communist Party in 1942. He came from a landlord family. After participating in the revolution, his position as an exploiting class has not been fundamentally transformed, and there has always been a serious right-leaning ideology. Until degeneration. Now, Yan Wenjie has become a spokesperson for the bourgeois rightists within the Party and has openly betrayed the Party.

Although Yan Wenjie has been seriously criticized by all the comrades of the Ministry of Foreign Trade for the above series of anti-Party remarks and actions, he still avoids the important and emphasizes the trivial, and shows no sincere repentance or confession. The criticism and struggle against him is being carried out in depth.

    对外贸易部揭露叛党分子严文杰
    反右派斗争开始后，他还同资产阶级右派分子里应外合，向党猖狂反扑
    本报讯　一个多月来，对外贸易部全体职工对党内的右派分子——行情研究所欧美研究室主任严文杰进行了揭露和批判。严文杰反党反人民反社会主义的面目已暴露在群众中，已处于孤立地位。
    5月底6月初，正当资产阶级右派分子向共产党展开疯狂进攻的时候，严文杰也和他们站在同一立场上，从多方面向党进行恶毒的攻击。他在党的会议上的发言，他写给人民日报的题为“闲话‘丫头口笔’及其流风”的稿子（未发表），特别是他给党中央的长篇的意见书中，提出了一系列反动的主张。他主张省市委以下的党委不要起党的领导作用。
        他要求把大批老干部“拿开”
    他不仅一般地反对党在政治上、组织上、思想上的领导，而且对党的领导和组织形式提出了荒谬的主张。
    他把党的领导局限于“应是社会主义方向和道路和重大方针政策问题”。他认为“只有党中央和省
  （市）党的委员会才能起这个作用，而地委、县委、区乡党委、机关与企业学校党委是不能起这个作用的”，“同时党政各有一套系统，同级政法、监察、团体、企业又听同级党的，造成重复”，这就形成了“以党代政或党政不分”。
    他要求省委以下党委和机关、企业、学校党委“不作为起党的领导作用的部门，只是通常党务部门”，“它对国家工作，机关企业事务，对社会人民无任何权力”，“机关企业地方政权只受政府和人民代表会议的领导”。
    严文杰的这些反动主张，其目的显然是腰斩党的组织，使党的上级领导机关架空，使党的方针政策根本无法贯彻执行，实质上是要取消党的领导。
    严文杰认为相当多的中下层党员干部（包括相当于中央的局长级干部）不称职，他们是靠党籍吃饭的。他把党的中下层干部丑化为“无知的庸才”。污蔑说：“职位在人之上的人，论起工作，瞠目结舌，甚至胡乱来一场。”“这些人最好的是不起作用，而一般的是起反作用。”另一方面，他认为“我们的业务都掌握在旧人员和青年知识分子手里，这些人又由于历史和家庭社会关系而不能得到提拔”。他说，这种情况已到达“使人难忍”的地步。他主张把第一次国内革命战争时期、抗日战争时期、解放战争时期培养起来的这些中下层党员“拿开”，用包下来的办法，给他们终生生活保证金，再按情况要他们退休或下乡，或担任简单的工作。
    严文杰为了实现“拿开”老干部的目的，首先诋毁和攻击了党的“德才兼备”的干部政策，并肆意歪曲。他把党过去执行的干部政策说成是“德乱才废”。他说：“到中下层‘才’被废弃了，而‘德’往往成了辈数、年资、领导欢心的排队。”他认为过去使用干部，只要是党员，级别高，就可得到重用。
    严文杰进而对人事部门作了恶毒的攻击。他认为人事部门的干部农村出身者多，知识水平低，狭窄，有宗派主义思想。他说：“管人的根本不知道什么是人，不承认别人的知识和才能。”他认为人事部门“儿戏别人的前途和名誉”。“党的威信会在此赔光”，并断言“结果很可能弄到个天怒人怨的地步”。
    他猖狂地要求中央接受他的这些策谋，他说人事问题是“人们不平”的根源，“义愤的焦点”，如果不能按照他的意见加以改变，则“矛盾永不能解决”。
    把严文杰的这些荒谬言论和他的其他谬论放在一起，就可以很明显地看出，他无非企图将忠实执行党和国家政策的党员干部从各个国家机关、企业、学校中赶走，使人事部门不能正确执行党的政治路线和组织路线，使党的领导无法实现。他要求取消群众运动，取消阶级斗争
    严文杰对三反、五反、肃反等运动大肆诬蔑。他说：“亲身经历过这些运动的人，想起来就感到心惊肉缩，毛骨悚然。”“一到此时，真是人人自危，社会大恐怖。”“伤人不谓不深。”他还造谣说：“不管什么人，只要领导手指一下，就可以斗的。”“斗的场面，比坐牢难受多了。”他甚至露骨地为已经死亡的封建势力喊叫，并对人民进行威胁：“想想看，在反恶霸斗地主的时候，一个受害的农民起来斗的时候，那种如疯似狂的气势，当以后有一个变化的时候，那些受过伤的人会怎样对付我们！”“我觉得，反会把一些本不一定是反革命的人逼着去反革命。”
    由于严文杰敌视人民，反对对人民的敌人进行斗争，他煞费苦心地提出了取消群众运动、取消阶级斗争的办法。他叫嚣：“不管成绩怎样，这种运动不能再搞了！”“要求政府规定：除非检察院同意，并由法院接受和主持外，一般机关、团体不得开斗争会。”他还公然提出要对领导肃反斗争的同志进行报复，说什么“冤死人者死”，
  “冤人坐牢者囚”。露骨地表现了他仇视革命的情绪。
    严文杰的目的，在于取消人民民主专政，使反革命分子有机可乘，取消党的群众路线，并幻想使反革命复辟。他污蔑在我们国内和党内没有思想言论自由
    严文杰认为在我们的国内和党内，思想言论是没有自由的。他说：
  “人们难能对自己的思想和言论作主！好像总是被人牵着走，被限定在划定的圈子里活动。”
    严文杰说，思想言论不自由的“社会原因是中下层人员的思想和知识水平低，自己不能思考，只有看看上面的点头摇首挥臂指手而干。”
    他把党的思想领导和统一领导，说成是束缚。他恶毒地说：“一切地方只看党委一处，行政、企业、报纸、工会、团等，党委气一出，千百鼻孔合吐，大家只有跟着说一途。”“只要在运动中积极听话的就是好干部，造成党内许多同志脑子简单。”对人们阐释领袖著作的文章，他恶毒地诽谤说：“好似一篇文章足以解决天下一切学说和工作问题。”“好似当今天下，除此之外就再无学问了。”又说：“我真不知何必如此？若一个人写了东西，要这么多解说人家才能懂，则本来那个东西便大可休矣！”
    他为了“开放”思想和言论，“建议”要多办些报纸，而且“要有今天（指右派分子猖狂进攻党暂时不予反击的时期）的风格”。因为他认为那个时期的报纸“真自由，有丰采”，能反映“民意”。他说：“有了这种舆论界，就是不整风，人们办事也会被迫小心些，看看反应和周围民意。”
    他不但反对群众运动，更反对领导运动“有一套政策方针”。他认为“运动一来谁也得顺着说，即或当时已看出不对，但谁也无可说，也不能说，只好硬干”，“这也成了思想上的束缚”。他要求：“少些运动，让人们有一个优裕的脑子，不要一天到晚在心肉紧张中过。”
    他反对党的知识分子思想改造政策，并公开贩卖自发论，说：“一切学习、报告、社会活动不得使用工作时间，一律听便自由参加。”“报告、讨论等并不见得就纠正了人”，应该“有事多在报上说，让人们考虑和自觉地去作。”
    可见严文杰要求的是资产阶级的言论、思想自由，反对党的思想领导和政治领导，从而瓦解党的队伍；在资产阶级思想进攻时，要求党放弃思想战线的阵地，让资本主义在思想上取得优势地位。他辱骂文人记者歌颂党和领袖是“丫头根，奴才性”
    在严文杰写的“闲话‘丫头口笔’及其流风”一稿中，可以看出他以多么疯狂的姿态敌视和谩骂人民。他把我们的社会生活描写成漆黑一团；而在这个社会中生活的人，“特别是文人记者”，“生成一种丫头根，奴才性”。
    他写道：目前有些人“出言走笔，专旨奉承”“情之不由衷与态之做作，听之读之令人如咽粪蛆，呕吐而肠肚出矣！”他认为在我们的生活中这是“屡见不鲜的”，“已成流成风”了。
    他写道：“有等文人记者，一提到领袖，一定要加上些‘感恩的心情’，什么‘虔诚仰慕……’呀，‘伟大’啊，‘朴素’啊……。除了做作和使人不忍读下去外，难免不使人追问笔者心里的什么‘根’和什么‘性’来。”
    他把对革命领袖的著作从各方面阐述，进行宣传和贯彻到各项工作中去，说成是“附说释义”。他主张不要“处处挂像，喻神明般地颂扬”。
    他把领导与被领导、领袖与人民、上级与下级，说成统治者与被统治者的关系，是“主子”和“奴才”的关系。他说：“‘丫头’者‘奶奶’之陪嫁品或附属物也。”“丫头”的一切“无不仰赖于奶奶之欢宠与忌恶”，而他们的精神世界是“一味‘顺应’，‘迎合’、‘阿谀’，甚至以得接啖主子之涎涕为宠幸的‘丫头’哲学”。
    严文杰这一篇反动文章正好充分暴露了他自己的“根”和“性”仇视党，反对革命领袖，敌视社会主义事业，和资产阶级右派正好是同一条“根”。他公开反对反右派的斗争，说对人民日报“很反感”
    党和人民的反右派斗争开始后，严文杰从党内到党外肆无忌惮地攻击党的政策，反对党和人民对右派分子的反击，与右派分子里应外合向党展开了猖狂反扑，负隅顽抗。
    6月8日以后，人民日报发表了几篇反右派的社论。严文杰一方面公然反对人民日报对右派的反击，除了在党的会议上发言和向人民日报寄了两篇稿子外，还向党中央发出了“紧急呼吁书。”
    严文杰大肆叫嚣“围剿开始了”、“是大张讨伐”、
  “人民日报的做法十分拙劣”、“如果说人家粗暴，人民日报比人家粗暴得多，厉害百倍”。他攻击人民日报的标题说：“‘人民没有委托葛佩琦说这样的话’是否经过投公民票了？我看葛佩琦也代表社会上的一部分人。”“‘可注意的民盟动向’，让民盟盟员看了毛骨悚然，好像人家进行什么不可告人的活动了。”把对右派进行反批评的人说成“言不由衷，看风使舵，是否真的，我很怀疑。”这些构成了他的一个概念：人民日报“过火”、“不高明”、“有火药气”。这时候，他还与右派分子一唱一和，给右派分子壮大声势。他说：“何必气量那么小？”“储安平说大和尚、小和尚就是辱骂领袖了吗？我倒很欣赏这句话。”“葛佩琦说要杀共产党人并没有说现在就杀啊！如果共产党真不好，为什么不允许别人杀你呢？”他竟与党外右派分子一起发出嚎叫“有顾虑”，对人民日报“很反感，很伤心”。
    另一方面，他也在对外贸易部内公然反对党和群众反右派的斗争。6月11日，对外贸易部黑板报摘登了右派分子李泰华的发言摘要。严文杰怒不可遏，代右派分子李泰华挺身而出，向黑板报以“中国共产党员”的名义提出了强硬“抗议”，他明知黑板报编委会是党领导的，可是他“质问这是谁的主意，为什么？”“我认为这种做法并不光明正大”。
    外贸部全部人员对严文杰这种公开的反党行为极为愤慨，纷纷提出质问。严文杰竟变本加厉地诽谤说：“对不同意的事抗议一下也不可以，我要问‘成什世界’。”
    严文杰1938年到延安参加革命，1942年参加共产党。出身于地主家庭。参加革命以后，他的剥削阶级的立场，一直没有得到根本的改造，一贯存在着严重的右倾思想。直至蜕化变质。现在，严文杰已成为资产阶级右派在党内的代言人，公开背叛了党。
    严文杰对上述一系列的反党言论和行动，虽经外贸部全体同志严肃批判，但他至今仍然避重就轻，并无真心悔改和认罪的表现。对他的批判和斗争正在深入展开。
