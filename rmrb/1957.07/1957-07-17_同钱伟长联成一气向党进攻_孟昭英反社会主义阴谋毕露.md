Colluding with Qian Weichang to Attack the Party
Meng Zhaoying's Anti-Socialist Conspiracy Fully Exposed

    (Our newspaper reports) In recent days, teachers and students of Tsinghua University, while criticizing the rightist Qian Weichang, have also launched criticisms against the rightist Meng Zhaoying, chairman of the Department of Radio Engineering, for his anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds. Meng Zhaoying, taking advantage of this opportunity of the Party rectification, joined forces with the rightist Qian Weichang to attack the Party.

    Consistent Anti-Communist and Anti-Soviet Statements

    Many teachers and students have exposed that Meng Zhaoying, under the guise of a people's teacher and scientist, has consistently been anti-communist and anti-socialist. Meng Zhaoying attended church schools from childhood and went to Yanjing University. Later, because he was appreciated by John Leighton Stuart, he was sent to study in the United States. In his mind, everything in the United States was good. He was proud of being praised by Americans for speaking good English, considering himself a superior Chinese. He himself said, "Apart from my skin being yellow and my eyes being white, I am practically an American." "During the Kuomintang era, I even hoped that an American would come to China to be president." In 1943, he also trained at the puppet Central Training Corps in order to go abroad and joined the Kuomintang. When the liberation had just happened, he was preparing to go to the United States to work. When talking about his anti-Soviet and anti-communist thoughts, Meng Zhaoying said that a counter-revolutionary had spread rumors and slandered the Soviet Red Army. He believed it deeply and helped promote it. He greatly despised Soviet science and technology. He opposed the Party's land reform policy. His second elder brother was a local tyrant and landlord, and was suppressed in the land reform. He always thought that the Communist Party was a "rebellious party" that implemented a policy of terror.

    Many teachers and students pointed out that before the Three-Anti Campaign, Meng Zhaoying's anti-Soviet and anti-communist stance was very clear. He openly said that the Soviet Union was a red imperialist, regarded Party members as people who monitored others, progressive elements as "blind followers," as the Communist Party's tail, and activists as fake. He himself was a tough bone. He also openly opposed resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and opposed land reform. All this shows that Meng Zhaoying did not properly accept transformation in the Three-Anti Campaign and the ideological remolding movement, so he opposed the socialist road and longed for the capitalist road. When the rectification began, he thought there was an opportunity and launched a vicious attack on the Party.

    Inciting Everywhere, Attacking the Party

    As soon as the rectification began, Meng Zhaoying began to seize the opportunity to attack the Party, and his anti-communist face reappeared in its original form. On the one hand, he claimed that the relationship between the Party and the masses was neither correct nor constant, and that the Party was now quite seriously detached from the masses. On the other hand, he spread rumors, threatening the Party to listen to various reactionary opinions. He also wanted to seize the leadership of the rectification, advocating the use of the methods of the "Three-Anti Campaign" to "rectify" the Party. At the forums, he incited the masses, saying that the Party committee was not determined to rectify and that its attitude was not correct, and that the principal was only intoxicated with applause and the achievements of Tsinghua. He also said that Li Weihan, head of the United Front Work Department, was not very humble, and that his speech at the United Front Work Department on June 4 was not letting go but tightening up. He also said that the relationship between people had been abnormal since the Three-Anti Campaign. When they met, they were all talking about "Marxism-Leninism," but in their hearts they were thinking about something else, not telling the truth. Such a social atmosphere was very dangerous. He said that the wall between the Party and the masses was built by the Communist Party, and now Communist Party members were suffering later and enjoying themselves first. He also said that the school's responsible comrades' relationship with the masses was guidance, not leadership. He described Party members as a group of people who "yes-men and did not use their brains," saying that Party members had poor independent thinking ability, and whatever the Party leaders said, the people below said the same, echoing others without using their brains, and were "wooden-headed." He seized on the leadership of the Party and launched a fierce attack, putting pressure on the Party by saying that the Party always talked about "class" and "line." He also told the students that the work of eliminating counter-revolutionaries had greatly deviated, and regarded the criticism of students' thoughts as a struggle between the enemy and ourselves. He incited the old teachers, saying that the young Party members and members of the Communist Youth League had a plan to "replace them." Meng Zhaoying was an alarmist everywhere, inciting and igniting the fire.

    Professor Dong Shuping, in criticizing Meng Zhaoying's rightist words and deeds, said: Meng Zhaoying this time wanted to take advantage of the Party rectification to achieve the goal of overthrowing the Party's leadership. He has always distorted the Party and the state's policies, for example, saying that the elimination of counter-revolutionaries has greatly deviated, that people do not speak the truth after the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, and that the new society is more hypocritical than the old society, etc. This is completely unfounded. His purpose in doing so is to negate the achievements of the elimination of counter-revolutionaries. He is also dissatisfied with our country's implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale, saying that the rural people's lives are very hard and that the lower-level cadres are doing things wrong. Whose lives is he concerned about? I think he is concerned about the lives of the landlord class! Associate Professor Wang Zutang of the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing said that Meng Zhaoying verbally acknowledged the leadership of the Party, but in essence opposed the leadership of the Party. His bourgeois ideology is deeply rooted. He scolded Party members as "yes-men" and said that he was a "tough bone," but in fact he was a stubborn element of the right wing. He does not want to reform at all. In the past year, he has used the excuse of being busy with work and having no time, and is unwilling to participate in the activities of the Jiusan Society, but after the rectification began, he became interested in the Jiusan Society and became active. He wants to take this opportunity to attack the Party.

    Is It Really Having a Title Without Power?

    Meng Zhaoying also took a weapon of "having a title without power," inciting the masses on one hand and attacking the Party on the other. In the rectification, he kept saying that he was "having a title without power," and that "being the director of the department is not as good as being a department staff member." But what is the truth? Meng Zhaoying is now a member of the Tsinghua University Affairs Committee, the director of the Department of Radio Engineering, a member of the Academic Division of the Technical Science Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the deputy director of the Institute of Electronics. At the beginning of this year, he represented the Chinese Academy of Sciences on a visit to the Soviet Union, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and other countries. Wu Youshou, a lecturer in the Department of Radio Engineering, questioned: "Whether it is the establishment of a new major in the department, the revision of the teaching plan, the issue of retaining teaching assistants, or the assessment of salaries and grades, you have participated in the discussions, and many things are decided only after discussing with you. From the process of discussing and studying these works, it is difficult to say that you are 'having a title without power.' If you still think that having a title and power under the leadership of the Party committee is empty talk, then what kind of power do you want? Do you want to abolish the leadership of the Party? Does it mean that the Party should not offer any opinions on anything? Is this how Mr. Meng thinks he has a title and power?" Professor Dong Shuping also revealed that Meng Zhaoying said that he had a title but no power, and did not know that a new major was established in his department, but in fact he knew it. On the contrary, he agreed to establish a new major on his own, without consulting with other comrades. This is not having a title but no power, but acting arbitrarily.

    Singing in Harmony with Qian Weichang

    Professor Wu Liusheng of the Department of Civil Engineering said that Meng Zhaoying and Qian Weichang seemed to have an action program in their words and deeds, such as poisoning the minds of young people, such as saying that they could not look at problems from a class standpoint, defaming the Party, alienating the relationship between the Party and the masses, saying that the Party would "replace" the old professors, etc. Associate Professor Xu Yizhuang said that Meng Zhaoying and Qian Weichang jointly held up a banner of "opposing sectarianism" to attack the Party. They were all inciting and spreading dissatisfaction with the Party at the forums, provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses, and exchanging so-called sectarian materials. Is this a coincidence? Professor Zhang Wei, Professor Li Piji, Lecturer Han Liying, and student Liu Runsheng also revealed Meng Zhaoying's wrong treatment of 150 students from three majors transferred from the Department of Engineering Physics to the Department of Radio Engineering. Everyone believes that this matter is coordinated with Qian Weichang's plan to launch a large signature campaign for "the merger of science and engineering schools." Student Liu Runsheng said that Mr. Meng Zhaoying was very interested in the big-character posters of the students of the Department of Engineering Physics. When I reported the students' situation to Director Meng on the evening of June 6, he said excitedly, let them go back to the Department of Engineering Physics! Our department does not want them at all. If they want to cause trouble, let them cause trouble! Let's go to the streets! Go to the Ministry of Higher Education and do something! I asked Mr. Meng at the time that these students had clearly been transferred to our department, and what Mr. Meng said would only deepen the contradictions. But he said that the contradictions were not created by us, let the school solve it! What is the purpose of Mr. Meng advocating that students cause trouble? If Meng's words were told to the students at that time, it would definitely cause confusion. Is this helping the Party rectify? Isn't this attacking the Party? This incident proves that Meng's words and deeds are singing in harmony with Qian Weichang, echoing each other.

    同钱伟长联成一气向党进攻
    孟昭英反社会主义阴谋毕露
    本报讯　最近几天，清华大学师生在批判右派分子钱伟长的同时，又展开了对右派分子、无线电系系主任孟昭英的反共反社会主义言行的批判。孟昭英利用这次党整风的机会，和右派分子钱伟长联成一体向党进攻。
    一贯的反共反苏言论
    许多教师和同学都揭发了孟昭英在人民教师和科学家的幌子下面，一贯反共反社会主义。孟昭英从小就在教会学校上学，大学上的是燕京，后来由于受了司徒雷登的赏识，被送到美国去留学。在他的心目中，美国的一切都是好的。他曾因为英文说得好，被美国人称赞而沾沾自喜，自命为高等华人。他自己说：“我除了皮肤是黄色的，眼睛是白的以外，简直就是美国人了”。“在国民党时代，我甚至希望有一个美国人来中国当总统。”1943年，他为了要出洋还在伪中央训练团受训，参加了国民党。刚解放时，他准备到美国去工作。孟昭英在谈到反苏反共思想时说，一个反革命分子曾造谣诬蔑苏联红军，他深信不疑，并代作宣传。对于苏联的科学技术，他是非常轻视的。他反对党的土改政策。他的二哥是一个恶霸地主，在土地改革中被镇压了。他总认为共产党是“乱党”，实行恐怖政策。
    许多教师和同学都指出，在三反以前孟昭英的反苏反共立场非常鲜明，公开说苏联是赤色帝国主义，把党员看成是监视别人的人，进步分子是“盲从”，是共产党的尾巴，积极分子都是假的。他自己是硬骨头。他并且公开反对抗美援朝，反对土改。这些都说明，孟昭英在三反运动中，在思想改造运动中，没有好好接受改造，所以反对社会主义道路，留恋资本主义道路。到整风开始，他认为有机可趁，就向党发起恶毒的攻击。
    到处煽动，向党进攻
    整风一开始，孟昭英就开始抓住机会向党进攻，因此他的反共面目又现了原形。他一方面扬言党群关系既不正，又不常，党现在是相当严重的脱离群众了。另一方面，他散布空气，威胁党要听取各种反动意见。他还想把整风领导权夺过去，提倡用“三反”时的办法“整”党。他在座谈会上煽动群众，说什么党委没有决心整风，态度还不端正，校长只陶醉于掌声、陶醉于清华的成绩。他又说什么统战部长李维汉很不虚心，他6月4日在统战部会上的发言不是放而是收。他又说，自三反以后人与人之间的关系不正常，见面全是一套“马列主义”，而心里想的又是一套，不讲真心话，这样的社会风气是很危险的。他说党群之间的墙是共产党砌的，现在共产党员是吃苦在后，享乐在前。他又说学校负责同志对群众的关系是牵导，不是领导。他描写党员是一群“唯唯诺诺不动脑筋”的人，说党员独立思考能力差，党的领导说什么，下面就说什么，人云亦云，不动脑筋，虽有脑筋也不敢动，是“木脑瓜”。他抓住党的领导这一环猛力攻击，说党动不动就是“阶级”“路线”，对党施加压力。他还对学生说肃反工作发生了大偏差，把同学的思想批判看作为敌我斗争。他对老教师则煽动说，青年党团员有“取而代之”的计划。孟昭英到处危言耸听，煽动点火。
    董树屏教授在批判孟昭英右派言行时说：孟昭英这次是想乘党整风企图达到推翻党的领导的目的。他一向歪曲党和国家的政策，例如说肃反发生很大偏差，肃反后人与人不说真心话，新社会比旧社会还虚伪等，这是毫无事实根据的。他这样做的目的在于否定肃反成绩。他还对我国实行统购统销政策不满，说农村人民生活很苦，下边干部做偏了。他在关心什么人的生活？我看他是在关心地主阶级的生活罢！机械制造系王祖唐副教授说，孟昭英口头上承认党的领导，实质上是反对党的领导。他的资产阶级思想是根深蒂固的。他骂党团员“唯唯诺诺”，说自己是“硬骨头”，其实他是右派的顽固分子。他根本不想改造。近一年来，他借口工作忙，无时间，不愿意参加九三学社的活动，但在整风开始后，他就对九三学社有兴趣了，就积极起来了。他是想借此机会来向党进攻的。
    真是有职无权吗？
    孟昭英还拿着一件“有职无权”的武器，一面煽动群众，一面向党进攻。在整风中，他一直说他是“有职无权”，“当系主任还不如系参谋”。可是事实上是怎样呢？孟昭英现在身为清华大学校务委员，无线电系系主任，中国科学院技术科学部的学部委员，电子学研究所副所长，今年年初代表中国科学院出国访问苏联、民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克等国家。无线电系讲师吴佑寿质问说“不管是系内新专业的设立，还是关于教学计划的修订，或是留助教的问题，以及评薪评级等，你都参加了讨论，而且许多事都是最后要和你商量以后才作决定的。从这些工作的讨论研究过程中，很难说你是‘有职无权’的。如果你还认为在党委领导下有职有权是空话，那么到底你还要什么权？是否要取消党的领导？是不是要党对什么事情都不提意见？是不是这样孟先生才认为是有职有权了呢？”董树屏教授也揭露孟昭英说，他说自己有职无权，自己系里成立新专业都不知道，其实他是知道的。相反，他独自答应另外成立一个新专业，而却不与其他同志商量。他这不是有职无权，而是独断独行。
    同钱伟长一唱一和
    土木系吴柳生教授说，孟昭英和钱伟长在言行上好像出于一个行动纲领，如毒化青年思想，如说不能用阶级立场看问题，丑化党，离间党群关系，说党要将老教授“取而代之”等。徐亦庄副教授说，孟昭英和钱伟长共同举着一面“反对宗派主义”的大旗向党进攻。他们都在座谈会上煽动，散布对党的不满情绪，挑拨党群关系，交流所谓宗派主义的材料，这难道是偶合吗？张维教授、李丕济教授、韩丽英讲师和刘润生同学等人，还揭露了孟昭英错误对待由工程物理系转交无线电系三个专业一百五十个学生的问题。大家认为，这件事是和钱伟长发动“理工合校”大签名的计划互相配合的。刘润生同学说，孟昭英先生对工程物理系学生的大字报很感兴趣。当6月6日晚上我向孟主任汇报同学的情况时，他很激动地说，叫他们回工程物理系去！我们系里根本没有要他们，要闹就让他们闹吧！上街吧！到高等教育部去，搞一搞吧！我当时就问孟先生，这些同学明明调到我们系了，像孟先生所讲只会加深矛盾。但他说，矛盾不是我们制造的，让学校去解决吧！孟先生主张学生去闹事，用意何在？当时如果把孟的话和同学讲，一定会引起混乱的，难道这是帮助党整风吗？难道这不是向党进攻吗？这件事证明孟的言行是和钱伟长一唱一和，互相呼应的。
