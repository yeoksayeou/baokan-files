The "Legal Advisor" Who Spouts Treasonous Theories - Dong Shilian

While exposing and refuting the right-wing element within the Party, Yan Wenjie, the employees of the Ministry of Foreign Trade have also revealed the anti-Communist and anti-socialist fallacies of Dong Shilian, a legal office advisor and right-wing element.

Dong Shilian, driven by madness, proposed the treasonous idea of the United Nations "trusteeship" of Taiwan. Dong Shilian also promoted and defended notorious traitors in Chinese history such as Wang Jingwei, Wu Sangui, and Cao Rulin. He shamelessly said: "Wang Jingwei cannot be considered a traitor. If Wang had known about Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, he would not have surrendered to Japan; Wu Sangui cannot be considered a traitor either, he only led the Qing troops into the pass for his woman; Cao Rulin signing the Twenty-One Demands cannot be considered treason either, there was no other way at the time." Therefore, he said, "Ge Peiqi said that even if the Communist Party collapses, people will not commit treason. This statement is still correct."

Dong Shilian viciously attacked the Communist Party Central Committee. He said: "The Communist Party's mistakes are mainly at the top, not at the bottom. To investigate responsibility, one should first trace it back to the Central Committee." He cursed the People's Daily as "the worst newspaper in the world."

Like other right-wing elements, Dong Shilian wantonly attacked our country's constitution and socialist system. He said, "There are many things in our country for which there is no law to follow," and "Having a constitution is the same as not having a constitution."

He slandered that our country "has not handled freedom of speech according to the provisions of the constitution, making the constitution a dead letter," and "The constitution only talks about freedom of speech and publication, but does not talk about freedom of thought. In my opinion, freedom of thought is inherent." He advocated that even if counter-revolutionaries are "sentenced, they can still speak, write articles, and publish things."

Dong Shilian virulently attacked the anti-rebellion movement, the policy of unified purchase and sale, the cadre policy, and the policy of transforming private industry and commerce. He tried his best to defend the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng, saying that Hu Feng's problem was only a matter of thought, not a counter-revolutionary. He said that Shu Wu's exposure of Hu Feng's problems was "selling out friends for personal gain," and that Lu Ying, who defended Hu Feng in the anti-Hu Feng struggle, "is admirable, he showed the backbone of the Chinese people." He said that the People's Daily's exposure of the crimes of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was "committing libel." He even said that the murderer who killed Li Dazhao "was also doing it for food, dispatched by his superiors, how can you say he was a counter-revolutionary?"

He said that "the only difference between capitalists and others is that they have a few more dollars," and regarding the use of intellectuals, he advocated "using their talents, regardless of their history or their friends."

The reactionary remarks of the right-wing element Dong Shilian are consistent. In his sixty years of life, half of his time was spent loyally serving as a foreign slave and comprador for imperialism. He worked for the Asiatic Petroleum Company in Shanghai for more than twenty years as a "traveling investigator" and "director," collecting economic intelligence for the British. In 1947, he also worked as a "compensation auditor" for the U.S. Navy Department in Shanghai. Before liberation, he was also a big gambler and a litigious trickster in Shanghai, gambling on horse racing, dog racing, smoking opium, and visiting prostitutes. He associated with many big gangsters and was an assistant to the reactionary rulers of the Kuomintang.

Since mid-June, the employees of the Legal Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the First Bureau, Second Bureau, and General Office have held seventeen meetings and sternly refuted Dong Shilian's reactionary remarks. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 满口卖国理论的“法律顾问”——董士濂

    满口卖国理论的“法律顾问”——董士濂
    对外贸易部职工群众在揭露和批驳党内右派分子严文杰的同时，又揭发了法律室顾问、右派分子董士濂的反共、反社会主义谬论。
    董士濂丧心病狂地提出了由联合国“托管”台湾的卖国主张。董士濂还为中国历史上臭名彰著的卖国贼汪精卫、吴三桂、曹汝霖鼓吹、辩护。他无耻地说：“汪精卫也不算卖国，汪若知道日本打珍珠港就不会投降日本；吴三桂也不算卖国，他是为他的女人，才引清兵入关；曹汝霖订二十一条也不算卖国，当时是没有办法。”他于是说，“葛佩琦说共产党亡了，人家也不会卖国，这话还是对的。”
    董士濂恶毒地攻击共产党中央。他说：“共产党的错误主要在上边，而不在下边，要追究责任，应首先追到中央。”他骂人民日报是“世界上最坏的报纸”。
    董士濂像其他右派分子一样，肆意攻击我国的宪法和社会主义制度。他说，“我国有好多事无法可依”，“有了宪法，还等于没有宪法”。
    他污蔑我国“对言论自由没有按照宪法的规定办，使宪法成为虚文”，“宪法上只讲言论、出版的自由，没有讲思想的自由。在我看来，思想的自由是天赋的”。他主张，反革命分子“判决了还可讲话，写文章，出版东西。”
    董士濂对肃反运动、统购统销政策、干部政策和对私营工商业改造政策等，无一不加以恶毒的攻击。他竭力替反革命分子胡风辩护，说胡风只是思想问题，不是反革命分子。他说，舒芜揭发了胡风的问题是“卖友求荣”，在反胡风斗争中为胡风辩解的吕荧，“是令人佩服的，他显示了中国人的骨气”。他说人民日报披露胡风反革命集团的罪行，是“犯了诽谤罪”。他甚至说，杀害李大钊的凶手，“也是为吃饭，受上级的派遣，能说他是反革命”？
    他说“资本家和别人不同的只是有几个钱而已”，对于使用知识分子，他主张“用他的才，不要管他的什么历史，什么朋友。”
    右派分子董士濂的反动言论是一贯的。在他六十多年的生活中，有一半时间是忠心耿耿地充当帝国主义的洋奴和买办。他在上海亚细亚美孚石油公司，当过二十多年“旅行调查员”“主任”，为英国人搜集经济情报。1947年，他还在上海美国海军部当“赔偿审核员”。解放前他也是上海一个大赌棍和玩弄“刀笔”的讼棍，赌跑马，赌跑狗，抽大烟，嫖妓女。他结交过很多大流氓，是国民党反动统治者的帮闲。
    对外贸易部法律室和一局、二局、办公厅的职工，从6月中旬以来，已经举行了十七次会议，对董士濂的反动言论进行了严正的驳斥。　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
