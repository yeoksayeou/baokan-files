    Vietnam's trade with socialist countries will double this year compared to 1956. From the beginning of the year to the present, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has held trade negotiations and signed trade agreements for 1957 with eight fraternal countries, including the Soviet Union, and is currently conducting trade negotiations with a trade delegation from the People's Republic of China. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will also send a trade delegation to Vietnam for trade negotiations.

    Due to the continuous growth of foreign trade, tens of thousands of hectares of previously abandoned coffee, tea, lacquer, and anise farms have now resumed operations; more than ten thousand previously idle handicraft workers have returned to production.

    In the past six months, the total business volume of private import and export trade in Haiphong was four times that of 1955.

    越南同兄弟国家贸易激增
    今年越南民主共和国同社会主义阵营各国的贸易总值将比1956年增加一倍。从年初到现在，越南民主共和国已和苏联等八个兄弟国家举行贸易谈判并签订了1957年的贸易协定，目前还正在和中华人民共和国贸易代表团进行贸易谈判。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国也将要派贸易代表团前来越南进行贸易谈判。
    由于对外贸易额的不断增长，过去荒废了的上万公顷咖啡、茶、漆、茴香等的园地，现在已经恢复经营；一万多久已停业的手工艺工人恢复了生产。
    过去六个月，海防私营进出口贸易的营业总值等于1955年的四倍。
