　　Zhang Naiqi and Other Rightists Conspired to Sabotage Socialist Transformation Using Double-Dealing Tactics
　　Xiang De Speaks to Refute Zhang Naiqi and Examines His Own Erroneous Statements
　　I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports.

　　After studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and hearing Premier Zhou's government work report, I would like to express some opinions on the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises.

　　The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce is one of the three major transformations in China's socialist revolution. After private industrialists and businessmen handed over the means of production in the overall public-private partnership last year, they believed that the transformation had been basically completed and the class struggle had basically ended. As a result, two questions were raised: 1. Are there still contradictions between the bourgeoisie and the working class, and what is the nature of these contradictions? 2. Do industrialists and businessmen still have a dual character, and do they still need to continue the transformation? Undoubtedly, the discussion of the above two questions is of great benefit to the implementation of the policy of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, especially the policy of transforming people. Over the past year or so, industrialists and businessmen have raised various questions from various aspects, which, in general, are nothing more than disputes over the above two questions. I believe that to obtain correct answers to the above two questions, we must analyze them from the essence of things. First of all, the relationship between the bourgeoisie and the working class is clearly a relationship of exploitation and being exploited, so it should be affirmed that the nature of the contradiction is antagonistic. This is the essence of class contradiction, and it can also be said to be the nature of contradiction. Why is it now said to be a contradiction within the people, a non-antagonistic one? This is because the Chinese Communist Party has adopted a policy of unity, education, and transformation towards the national bourgeoisie based on China's specific conditions, and the national bourgeoisie has been able to accept this policy. This aspect—the non-antagonistic aspect—is the transformation of the contradiction, not the nature of the contradiction. Therefore, it can be said that as long as classes still exist, antagonistic contradictions still exist, but under certain conditions, they can be transformed into non-antagonistic ones, and once the conditions are out of balance, they will return from non-antagonistic to their nature, that is, antagonistic. Similarly, when it comes to the dual character of the national bourgeoisie, it is not like two symmetrical sides of an object, but one side is basic, that is, essential, and the other side is just a reflection of the influence of conditions under certain conditions. What is the basic aspect of the dual character? That is the commonality of the bourgeoisie, that is, the aspect of the exploitative nature of seeking profit, not working for gain, and benefiting oneself at the expense of others. The other aspect is the revolutionary aspect, which is due to the special historical conditions of China, that is, under the semi-feudal and semi-colonial circumstances, the Chinese national bourgeoisie, like the people of the whole country, suffered from the oppression of the three major enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. This is the characteristic of the national bourgeoisie. Therefore, it can be said that as long as classes still exist, the essence of classes still exists, so the dual character still exists, but under certain conditions, due to the different effects of conditions, the content of the dual character, that is, the growth and decline of the positive and negative aspects, will be different.

　　Since the answers to the above two questions all involve the issue of the existence of classes, then industrialists and businessmen will ask again, in China's current situation, does the bourgeoisie exist, or does it not exist? This is indeed another question that has caused a lot of controversy. My analysis is as follows: I believe that the existence or non-existence of classes should be examined from the social structure. The social structure includes its foundation and superstructure. The foundation is the issue of ownership, and the superstructure is the political system, laws, literature and art, customs and habits, and ideology. China's current situation is: in terms of the material foundation of society, although capitalist ownership has basically ended with the overall public-private partnership of private industry and commerce, there is still fixed interest income with the nature of exploitation; in terms of the superstructure, although the people's democratic political power has been established since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the ideological consciousness of some people still has serious bourgeois ideas. It must also be pointed out that in terms of the material foundation of society, the issue of changing capitalist ownership is only related to the capitalists, and only they are the objects of transformation. However, the issue of changing bourgeois ideology is not only related to the capitalists, but also involves many people from all classes and strata in society who have been infected for a long time and will have thousands of threads of connection. In this regard, these people are also objects of transformation. Therefore, it can be said that in China's current situation, classes certainly still exist in society. It not only remains in the material foundation of society in the form of a fixed interest system, but also exists more widely in the superstructure of society in the form of ideological consciousness. Of course, since China's socialist revolution has achieved a decisive victory and the relations of production have undergone fundamental changes, China's bourgeoisie is in the process of gradual elimination. The task of China's proletarian dictatorship is to transform this old society with the world outlook of the working class to ensure that China can eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society. This transformation should include the foundation of society and its superstructure. Therefore, the implementation of the proletarian dictatorship must not only carry out serious class struggle in the economic system, but also in the political and ideological aspects, that is, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, to comprehensively solve the question of who will win. It is wrong not to recognize this. Premier Zhou said in his report, "Among the contradictions within the people, there is still an antagonistic side between the bourgeoisie and the working class, and there is still a serious class struggle... In this rectification movement, there are ideological struggles and political struggles. Therefore, when we correctly handle contradictions among the people, we must not ignore the existence of class struggle, nor can we ignore the existence of contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. Consolidating the achievements of the socialist revolution and continuing to carry out and thoroughly complete the socialist transformation is still an important task for us in the future." This passage is completely correct.

　　Rightists use double-dealing tactics to conspire to sabotage China's socialist transformation, always trying their best to spread various fallacies with flowery words, saying that there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements now, and there is no need to transform them anymore, and even saying that capitalists are more intelligent than workers. Zhang Naiqi is an outstanding representative of the rightists. He absurdly said that after the high tide of public-private partnership, the dogmatists' proposal that the national bourgeoisie still has a dual character cannot but make industrialists and businessmen feel frightened. He opposes the transformation of bourgeois elements requiring a "complete change of character" with the essence of class, but only wiping off the "brand" on the skin. He said that "the essence of class is different from the class characteristics of people" to blur the essential difference between capitalists and workers. He also shamelessly said that "fixed interest is not exploitation"; said that "bureaucratism is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism"; said that "the difference between leaders and those being led can only be the difference between the advanced and the backward." He even more viciously provoked and incited the industrial and commercial circles. He falsely claimed that industrialists and businessmen asked, "Why is it still a dual character? After seven years of transformation, most of the reactionary landlords have been transformed into working people. Why are we, as allies, still a dual character? Is there going to be another 'Five-Anti' campaign?" He also said, "The dividend income in the past few years was not as good as savings deposits, and today's fixed interest is not as good as savings deposits, and we still have to bear the infamous name of exploitation, and they are not convinced in their hearts." He deliberately confused the workers' labor income with the capitalists' exploitative income, provoking the relationship between industrialists and businessmen and workers, saying, "As far as I know, many employees' savings deposits exceed 2,000 yuan. It seems unreasonable to consider a capitalist if the capital slightly exceeds 2,000 yuan." Zhang Naiqi has spread many fallacies in the industrial and commercial circles in recent years, and the above are just a few examples. Zhang Naiqi's fallacies are systematically spreading poison, completely violating Chairman Mao's six criteria for judging whether our words and actions are right or wrong. Zhang Naiqi is carrying out reactionary activities against the Party, against the leadership of the working class, and sabotaging the socialist cause. He attempted to encourage the industrial and commercial circles to resist transformation, to leave the leadership of the Party, to leave the socialist road, and to restore capitalism in China. This is his poisonous and sinister conspiracy. We must thoroughly crush it.

　　I examine myself because the essence of the bourgeoisie has a dual character, and its negative side is connected to Zhang Naiqi. My bourgeois thoughts and position have not been transformed. For example, in my speech at the Hunan Provincial Political Consultative Conference in May of this year, I emphasized that the reason why the enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial circles was not fully exerted was attributed to sectarianism, ignoring the importance of self-education and self-transformation, and also cited some distorted words, which fueled the dissatisfaction and resentment of the industrial and commercial circles towards the transformation, and had a bad influence. This is my mistake, and I am very ashamed. I am determined to study hard, strengthen self-transformation, examine and correct my mistakes, strive for progress, and in this struggle against the rightists, temper myself, draw a clear line from the rightists in my thoughts and position, and fight the rightists to the end.

　　In the winter of 1955, industrialists and businessmen across the country listened to Chairman Mao's words, recognized the laws of social development, grasped their own destiny, and took the socialist road. Our greatest interest is to transition to socialism smoothly. We must continue to listen to Chairman Mao's words, crush the vicious conspiracies of the rightists Zhang Naiqi and others against us, work with the employees in the enterprises, and use the enterprises as a base for self-transformation, and finally transform ourselves into self-reliant laborers. That will be the time of "class elimination, personal happiness."

　　Please criticize and correct any errors in the above speech.

    章乃器等右派分子阴谋用两面手法破坏社会主义改造
    向德发言驳斥章乃器并检查自己的错误言论
    我完全同意并拥护周总理的政府工作报告和其他几个报告。
    我学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话和听到周总理的政府工作报告以后，想就对私营工商业者的社会主义改造问题发表一点意见。
    对私营工商业的社会主义改造是我国社会主义革命三大改造之一。私营工商业者在去年全行业公私合营交出了生产资料以后，认为改造已基本完成，阶级斗争已经基本结束。于是提出两个问题：一、资产阶级和工人阶级之间还有没有矛盾，是什么性质的矛盾？二、工商业者还有没有两面性，还要不要继续改造？对以上两个问题的讨论，无疑地对贯彻对私营工商业社会主义改造的政策特别是对人的改造的方针是大有好处的。一年多来工商业者从各方面提出各种各样的问题，总的讲，都不外乎是对以上两个问题的纷争。我认为要求得对以上两个问题的正确答复，必须从事物的本质来分析。首先说资产阶级和工人阶级的关系很显明地是剥削与被剥削的关系，因而应当肯定地说矛盾的性质是对抗的。这就是阶级矛盾的本质，也可以说是矛盾的本性。现在为什么又说是属于人民内部的矛盾，是非对抗性的呢？这是由于中国共产党根据我国的具体条件对民族资产阶级采取团结、教育、改造的政策而民族资产阶级又能接受这个政策所促成的。这一方面——非对抗性的一面，是矛盾的转化，而不是矛盾的本性。因此可以说只要阶级还存在，对抗性的矛盾就还存在，但在一定的条件下受到条件的作用可以转化为非对抗性，而当一旦条件失去平衡时，就又会由非对抗性回到它的本性即对抗性。同样，讲到民族资产阶级的两面性的问题，它不同于一件物体的两个对称的侧面，而是有一面是基本的，也即是本质的，另一面只是在一定条件下受到条件影响作用的反映。两面性的基本一面是什么呢？那就是资产阶级的共性，就是唯利是图、不劳而获、损人利己的剥削本质的一面。另一面是革命性的一面，它是由于中国历史的特殊条件即在半封建半殖民地的情况下，中国民族资产阶级同全国人民一样受着帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三大敌人压迫所促成的。这就是民族资产阶级的特性。因此可以说只要阶级还存在，阶级本质就存在，因而两面性就还存在，但在一定的条件下由于条件的作用不同，两面性的内容即积极一面和消极一面的消长会有不同。
    对上述两个问题的答复，既然都牵涉到阶级的存在问题，那么，工商业者就再要问，在我国现时的情况下，资产阶级是存在呢，还是不存在？这的确又是一个引起争论很多的问题。我的分析是这样的：我认为阶级的存在不存在，要从社会结构来检验。社会结构是包括它的基础和上层建筑物。基础就是所有制的问题，上层建筑物就是政治制度、法律、文艺、风俗习惯以及思想意识等。我国现在的情况是：在社会的物质基础方面，资本主义所有制虽然随着私营工商业的全行业公私合营已经基本结束了，但还有剥削性质的定息收入；在上层建筑物方面，虽然自中华人民共和国成立之日起，就已建立起人民民主的政权，但若干人的思想意识还存在着严重的资产阶级思想。还必须指出，在社会物质基础方面，对改变资本主义所有制的问题只对资本家那部分人有关，只有他们是改造的对象，而对改变资产阶级思想的问题，则不仅与资本家有关，在社会上各阶级阶层的人中间，不少的人受到了长期的感染，都会有千丝万缕的牵连，在这一点上讲，这些人都也是改造的对象。因此可以说，在我国现时的情况下，社会上肯定地还有阶级存在。它不仅以定息制度的形态还残存于社会的物质基础中，而且还以思想意识的形态更广泛地存在于社会上层建筑物中。当然，由于我国社会主义革命已经取得决定性的胜利，生产关系起了根本的变化，我国的资产阶级已是处在逐步消灭中。我国无产阶级专政的任务就是要以工人阶级的宇宙观，来改造这个旧社会，以保证我国能够通过和平的道路消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。这个改造应当是包括社会的基础和它的上层建筑物。因此贯彻无产阶级专政不仅在经济制度方面，必然还要在政治方面和思想方面进行严重的阶级斗争，即社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，以全面地解决谁战胜谁的问题。不认识到这一点，是错误的。周总理报告中说，“在人民内部矛盾中，目前还存在着资产阶级同工人阶级对抗的一面，还存在着严重的阶级斗争，……在这次整风运动中，有思想斗争，也有政治斗争。因此，当我们正确处理人民内部矛盾的时候，绝不能无视还有阶级斗争的存在，也不能无视还有敌我矛盾的存在。巩固社会主义革命的成果，继续进行和彻底完成社会主义改造，还是我们今后的一项重要任务。”这段话，是完全正确的。
    右派分子用两面派手法，阴谋破坏我国的社会主义改造，总是千方百计地，花言巧语地发出各种谬论，说现在资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子已经没有本质上的区别了，不要再改造了，甚至说资本家比工人还要高明一些。章乃器就是右派分子中集大成的突出的代表。他荒谬地说，教条主义者在公私合营高潮以后，提出民族资产阶级仍然有两面性，不能不使工商业家听了之后惊心动魄。他反对资产阶级分子的改造要有阶级本质的“脱胎换骨”的改造，而只是在皮肤上擦去“烙印”便了。他说什么“阶级本质与人的阶级特性是有所不同的”，以模糊资本家与工人有本质的区别，他还无耻地说“定息不是剥削”；说“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”；说“领导者与被领导者的区别，只能是先进与落后的区别”。他更恶毒地向工商界进行挑拨和煽动，他捏称工商业家问“为什么还是一个两面性，改造七年了反动的地主都已大多数改造成为劳动人民了，何以作为盟友的我们仍然还是两面性？是不是还要来一个五反？”他又说“过去几年的股息收入还不如存款，今天的定息也不如存款，还要负剥削的恶名，他们心中是不服的”。他故意把工人的劳动收入和资本家的剥削收入混淆起来，挑拨工商业者和工人的关系，说什么“据我了解，不少职工的储蓄存款都超过二千元。资本稍微超过二千元就算一个资本家，似乎不够合理”。章乃器几年来在工商界散布的谬论还多得很，以上仅举其一二。章乃器这些谬论是有系统地在散布毒素，完全违反了毛主席讲话的判断我们的言论和行动的六条是非标准。章乃器是在进行反对党、反对工人阶级领导和破坏社会主义事业的反动活动。他企图鼓动工商界抵抗改造，离开党的领导，离开社会主义道路，使资本主义在我国复辟。这就是他的毒辣的险恶的阴谋。我们要彻底粉碎它。
    我检查自己由于资产阶级本质具有两面性，其消极的一面即通到章乃器方面，我的资产阶级的思想和立场还没有改造过来。如我本年五月在湖南省政协会议上发言，强调工商界的积极性未能充分发挥的原因归咎于宗派主义，忽视自我教育和自我改造的重要性，而且引述一些歪曲的话，助长了工商界对改造不服气和不满的情绪，发生了不好的影响。这是我的错误，我很惭愧。我决心要努力学习，加强自我改造，检查和改正自己的错误，争取进步，并在此次反右派分子的斗争中，锻炼自己，从自己的思想和立场上与右派划清界线，对右派分子斗争到底。
    全国工商业者在一九五五年冬听了毛主席的话，认识社会发展规律，掌握自己的命运，走社会主义的道路。我们最大的利益就是要平平稳稳地过渡到社会主义去。我们要继续听毛主席的话，粉碎右派分子章乃器等对我们的恶毒阴谋，在企业内同职工一道劳动，把企业作为自我改造的基地，到最后改造成为自食其力的劳动者，那时就是“阶级消灭，个人愉快”。
    以上发言错误之处，请各位批评指正。
