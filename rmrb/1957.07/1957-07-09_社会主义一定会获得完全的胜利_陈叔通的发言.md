    I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports.
    These reports fully demonstrate the more brilliant achievements our country made in the socialist revolution and socialist construction in 1956. These brilliant achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party. As Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the First Session of the First National People's Congress, the core force leading our cause is the Communist Party, and the theoretical foundation guiding our thought is Marxism-Leninism, which cannot be shaken by any force. Without the Communist Party as our leading core and without Marxism-Leninism as the theoretical foundation of our thought, our great cause could not be victoriously advanced.

    **Right-wing elements, with despicable intentions, viciously obliterate the facts**
    Fellow deputies, the people of the whole country will never forget what kind of country we originally were. Before liberation, our country was under the multiple oppression of feudalism, bureaucrat-capitalism, and imperialism. A few exploiters lived a life of luxury and corruption, while the vast working people who created social wealth were in a state of poverty and hunger. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Communist Party, the three major enemies were overthrown, a people's democratic dictatorship was established, and the people of the whole country were led to carry out socialist construction, thereby ensuring the material and cultural needs of the working people of the whole country. The lives of the peasants and workers, who account for more than 80 percent of our country's population, have been significantly improved, and the stable lives of people of other classes have also been guaranteed. It is as if the lives of the people of the whole country are taken care of, and overall consideration and appropriate arrangements are made. This earth-shaking change would be unimaginable without the leadership of the Communist Party. The socialist revolution currently underway is unprecedented in Chinese history, and it is much more arduous than the new democratic revolution in the previous stage. If someone takes the socialist revolution too easily, or even says that the socialist revolution can be completed without the leadership of the Communist Party, then they are either extremely naive and ignorant, or they have ulterior motives.
    It is an arduous task for the Chinese Communist Party to lead the people of the whole country in building socialism. First, we are building socialism through self-reliance. We are an economically and culturally backward agricultural country with a poor foundation. How can such a country afford to build an industrial country with heavy industry as the center? However, thanks to the efforts of the broad masses of workers and peasants, remarkable achievements have been made in increasing production and practicing economy. Taking the situation in 1956 as an example, the first five-year plan has been implemented for four years, and the main indicators have either been completed ahead of schedule or are close to completion. Taking steel production as an example, the production volume in old China was pitifully small. In 1949, the national steel production was only over 100,000 tons; in 1956, steel production had reached more than 4.4 million tons. Old China had almost no machine manufacturing industry, let alone automobile manufacturing and aircraft manufacturing industries, but now they have all been established, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, industry, and commerce has basically achieved a decisive victory. These facts prove the correctness of the Party's leadership and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, which has promoted the rapid development of our country's productive forces. As everyone knows, enemies at home and abroad are unwilling to accept our peaceful construction and have used various methods to obstruct and sabotage it. At the same time, our country has also encountered many major natural disasters in the past few years. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad have been smashed, and the people have been led to overcome the disasters. All the difficulties have not hindered our self-reliant efforts to achieve great achievements on all fronts of construction. This is simply an unimaginable miracle. If we had not followed the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, could these miracles have appeared? It can be affirmed that it would never have been possible.
    Second, we are doing things that our predecessors have never done before. All planned economic work is new, and no one has experience. In the beginning, we can be said to be laymen. Fortunately, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union serves as a mirror for us, and the Soviet Union has given us a lot of selfless help, which we will never forget. Other fraternal countries have also given us a lot of help, and we should also be grateful. Learning and applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries has allowed us to avoid many detours. However, learning from the experience of other countries is not easy. When we apply it, we must also combine it with the specific conditions of our own country. Therefore, our construction work is still very arduous. Some people say that our construction plans are constantly changing, which is because of a lack of experience and also due to changes in objective conditions. In general, the achievements of our socialist construction cause are tremendous. Of course, it is not without errors and shortcomings. The Chinese Communist Party has also educated the people of the whole country to learn and do at the same time, and has gained a lot of new experience in the past few years. Some of these experiences have also been gained from mistakes and shortcomings, which is extremely beneficial to future construction work. If we had not followed the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, could we have achieved such achievements? It can be affirmed that it would never have been possible.
    Third, our socialist construction is carried out under the needs of the domestic people's lives and the tense situation created by imperialism. We cannot but speed up the pace of construction. Here, there is a contradiction between people's consumption and national accumulation. However, we have adopted the policy of hard work and thrift in building the country, on the one hand improving people's lives, and on the other hand firmly grasping the speed of construction, and have achieved great achievements. The United Nations report under the control of U.S. imperialism also had to admit that our country's industrial growth rate last year ranked first in the world. It can be seen that our country is able to handle the contradiction between people's consumption and national accumulation very well. If we had not followed the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, could we have achieved such achievements? It can be affirmed that it would never have been possible. However, the right-wing elements viciously obliterate these facts before us, and paint the brilliant achievements of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction as a complete mess. They oppose our correct analysis that "achievements are the main thing, and shortcomings and errors are individual," and maliciously exaggerate individual or partial shortcomings and errors into fundamental or comprehensive shortcomings and errors in our country's revolution and construction, making some people with unstable positions or unclear right and wrong unable to recognize the achievements of our country's revolution and construction, attempting to realize the right-wing elements' conspiracy to oppose the leadership of the Party and oppose the socialist cause.

    **The right-wing elements' attempt to turn back the wheel of history is doomed to failure**
    The right-wing elements distort the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism left over from the old society and still existing in our work today as being produced by our country's socialist system and the Party's leadership, and falsely publicize that socialism plus bureaucracy is more dangerous than capitalism, thereby slandering the Party and the socialist system, and attempting to drag our country from socialism back into the quagmire of capitalism, making the broad working people relive the miserable life of old China. This is absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country, and we must wage a resolute struggle against them.
    The right-wing elements attempt to use the fact that some people are not yet accustomed to the new system and even have resistance as their activity base to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and shake the socialist system. Because the workers and peasants cannot be used and cannot be grasped, they vainly attempt to use some intellectuals and industrialists and businessmen to carry out criminal activities. For example, Zhang Naiqi, he attempted to use the negative side of the industrial and commercial circles to bewitch the industrial and commercial circles. He said: the bourgeoisie no longer has two sides; there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements; fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income; bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism; and so on. This is to deny the existence of classes, to deny the leadership of the working class, to oppose the Communist Party, and to oppose socialism. According to the People's Daily on July 3, when Zhang Naiqi participated in the secret meeting of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji at Quanjude, he expressed his willingness to assume a position in the future reactionary organization instigated by the Zhang-Luo alliance, proving that he was colluding with their secret organization. It should be known that even if a few intellectuals and industrialists and businessmen are bewitched by them, the vast majority of intellectuals and industrialists and businessmen sincerely trust the leadership of the Communist Party and are determined to take the socialist road. Even those who are temporarily bewitched by the right-wing elements will wake up in the anti-rightist struggle, return to the side of the people, and fight against the right-wing elements. The right-wing elements' attempt to use the social basis of the bourgeoisie that is being eliminated to usurp leadership and turn the wheel of history backward is destined to fail.

    **We must resolutely launch a struggle against the right-wingers and actively help the Communist Party to rectify its work style**
    The people of the whole country must unite more closely and wage a resolute struggle against the right-wing elements to consolidate the leadership of the Party and defend the socialist cause. We must draw a clear line between ourselves and the right-wing elements so that the right-wing elements are in a completely isolated position. For those who are influenced by the right-wing elements and have certain errors in their thinking, we must distinguish them from the right-wing elements. They still support the Party and are willing to take the socialist road. As long as they draw a clear line between themselves and the right-wing elements and participate in the struggle against the right-wing elements, they can be tempered in the struggle, correct their mistakes, and unite with the people of the whole country. As for those right-wing elements who resolutely oppose the Party and oppose socialism, we must thoroughly counterattack them and fight to the end.
    Some people think that after we launch a counterattack against the right-wing elements, it will not be good for the people to "let go" and "contend." This idea is wrong. It is mainly caused by a lack of understanding of the Party's rectification movement. As long as it is beneficial to socialism, not detrimental to socialism, as long as it is beneficial to consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party, not opposing or weakening the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as opinions are put forward on the style of Party members on the common basis of socialism, no matter how sharp, how one-sided, or even erroneous the opinions are, I think the Communist Party welcomes them. The right-wing elements are spreading rumors, saying that the Party is "taking back" and cannot speak anymore. We must not listen to these rumors, not be used by the right-wing elements, and still actively help the Party to rectify its work style. The People's Daily editorial on July 1 said: "The Communist Party continues to rectify its work style, and the democratic parties have also begun to rectify their work style. After the rampaging right-wingers are repelled by the people, the rectification can be carried out smoothly." Is the Party "taking back"? Absolutely not. Moreover, as far as I know, all the opinions put forward to help the Party and the government do a good job are being analyzed and studied. Those that should be accepted are accepted. Among them, there are also those that still need to be studied, or those that cannot be done for a while, or those that are wrong, and the reasons are explained separately. Isn't this a realistic spirit?
    The people of the whole country must understand: our helping the Party to rectify its work style is to make the Party's leadership more consolidated, so that we can complete our socialist construction, so that our country can become a prosperous and strong socialist industrial country.
    The people of the whole country must understand: to achieve this goal, we must strengthen our learning, raise our socialist awareness, unite closely, and, under the leadership of the working-class party—the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely take the socialist road. Our launching a resolute struggle against the right-wing elements is not for anything else, but for socialism. Socialism will surely achieve complete victory.

### 社会主义一定会获得完全的胜利  陈叔通的发言

    社会主义一定会获得完全的胜利
    陈叔通的发言
    我完全同意周总理政府工作报告和其他各种报告。
    这些报告完全证明一九五六年我们国家社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业取得了更辉煌的成就。这些辉煌的成就是和共产党的领导分不开的。正如毛主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕词中所说，领导我们事业的核心力量是共产党，指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义，这是任何力量不能动摇的。没有共产党作我们的领导核心，没有马克思列宁主义作我们思想的理论基础，我们的伟大事业是不可能胜利推进的。
    右派分子怀着卑鄙的目的，恶毒地抹杀事实
    各位代表，全国人民决不会忘记我们原来是怎样的一个国家。解放以前，我们国家处在封建主义、官僚资本主义和帝国主义重重压迫之下，少数剥削者过着奢侈腐烂的生活，而创造社会财富的广大劳动人民却处于贫困饥饿的状态。由于共产党的正确领导，推翻了三大敌人，建立了人民民主专政的国家，领导了全国人民进行社会主义建设，从而保证了全国劳动人民的物质、文化生活的需要，使占我国人口百分之八十以上的农民和广大职工的生活显著地提高，同时也保证了其他阶层人民的安定的生活，简直是把全国人民的生活包了下来，加以统筹兼顾，适当安排。这个翻天覆地的大变革，如果没有共产党的领导是不可想像的。现在正在进行的社会主义革命，在中国历史上是没有前例的，它比前一阶段的新民主主义革命要艰巨得多。如果有人把社会主义革命看得太容易，甚至说没有共产党的领导也能完成社会主义革命，那末他们不是极端幼稚无知，便是别有用心。
    中国共产党领导全国人民建设社会主义，工作是艰巨的。第一，是以自力更生来建设社会主义的。我们是经济和文化落后的农业国，底子是穷的。这样的国家要以重工业为中心建成工业国，怎样负担得起呢？可是由于广大工农群众的努力，增产节约取得巨大的成绩，以一九五六年的情况来看，第一个五年计划执行了四年，主要指标有些已经提前完成，有些已经接近完成了。以钢的生产为例，旧中国的生产量是小得可怜的，一九四九年全国钢产量只有十几万吨；一九五六年钢的生产便已达到四百几十万吨。旧中国几乎没有机器制造业，更没有汽车制造业和飞机制造业，而现在都已建立起来了，而且农业手工业工商业社会主义改造基本上都取得了决定性的胜利。这些事实证明了党的领导的正确，社会主义制度的无比优越，促进了我国生产力的突飞猛进的发展。大家都知道，国内外敌人是不甘心而且用种种方法阻挠和破坏我们的和平建设的，同时我们国家几年来也遭遇到好多次重大的自然灾害。但是，由于党和政府的正确领导，粉碎了国内外敌人的阴谋，领导了人民战胜了灾荒。所有的困难并没有阻碍我们自力更生地在建设事业的各个战线上取得巨大的成就。这简直是难于想像的奇迹。如果没有中国共产党领导我们走社会主义道路，这些奇迹能够出现吗？肯定地说，是决不可能的。
    第二，我们做的是我们的前人没有做过的事业，一切计划经济的工作都是新的，谁也没有经验，开头可以说是外行。幸而有苏联的先进经验作为我们的借镜，苏联并且给了我们许多大公无私的帮助，这是我们永远不能忘记的。其他兄弟国家也给了我们许多帮助，我们亦应该感谢的。学习和运用苏联和其他兄弟国家的先进经验，使我们少走了许多弯路。但学习别国的经验，并不是容易的。我们在运用的时候，还必须同本国的具体情况结合起来。所以我们的建设工作仍然是很艰巨的。有人说，我们的建设计划时常改变，这是因为缺乏经验，亦是客观情况的变化所使然。总的说来，我们的社会主义建设事业的成绩是巨大的，当然亦不是没有错误和缺点的。中国共产党并且教育了全国人民边学边做，在这几年中取得了不少新的经验。这些经验也有些是从错误和缺点里得来的，对今后的建设工作是极有利的。如果没有中国共产党领导我们走社会主义道路，我们能够取得这样的成绩吗？肯定地说，是决不可能的。
    第三，我们的社会主义建设是在适应国内人民生活的需要和帝国主义制造的紧张形势下进行的，我们不能不加快建设的速度。这里就存在了一个人民消费与国家积累的矛盾。但是我们采取了艰苦劳动、勤俭建国的方针，一方面改善了人民的生活，一方面紧紧地掌握了建设的速度，取得了巨大的成绩。美帝国主义控制下的联合国的报道，亦不得不承认我国去年工业增长速度居世界第一位。可见我们的国家是能够很好地处理人民消费与国家积累之间的矛盾的。如果没有中国共产党领导我们走社会主义道路，我们能够取得这样的成绩吗？肯定地说，是决不可能的。但是右派分子恶毒地抹煞摆在我们面前的这些事实，把我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的辉煌成就描绘得一团漆黑。他们反对我们的“成绩是主要的，缺点和错误是个别的”的正确分析，恶意地把个别性质或部分性质的缺点和错误夸大为我国革命和建设中根本的或全面性质的缺点和错误，使一些立场不稳或是非不明的人认不清我国革命和建设的成果，企图实现右派分子反对党的领导，反对社会主义事业的阴谋。
    右派分子使时代车轮倒退的企图注定要失败
    右派分子把旧社会遗留下来，在今日我们工作中还存在着的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义，歪曲为是我国社会主义制度和党的领导所产生的，歪曲地宣传社会主义加上官僚主义比资本主义还危险，从而毁谤党和社会主义制度，企图把我们国家从社会主义拉回到资本主义的泥坑里去，使广大劳动人民重过旧中国的悲惨生活。这是全国人民决不能容忍的，必须和他们作坚决的斗争。
    右派分子企图利用一部分人对于新的制度还不习惯以至还有抵触情绪作为他们的活动基础，用以反对共产党的领导，动摇社会主义的制度。他们因工农群众不受利用，抓不住，就妄想利用一部分知识分子和工商界来进行罪恶活动。就如章乃器，他就企图利用工商界消极的一面来蛊惑工商界。他说：资产阶级已经没有两面性；资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子已经没有本质的差别；定息不是剥削，是不劳而获；官僚主义是比资本主义更加危险的敌人；等等。这就是否定阶级的存在，就是否定工人阶级的领导，就是反对共产党，反对社会主义。据七月三日人民日报所载，章乃器参加章伯钧、罗隆基在全聚德密谋的时候，他表示要在章、罗联盟策动的未来的反动组织中担任职务，证明他是跟他们的秘密组织勾结在一起的。要知道知识分子和工商业者纵然有少数人受他们的蛊惑，可是绝大多数知识分子和工商界是衷心地信赖共产党的领导的，是坚决要走社会主义的道路的。就是那些一时受到右派分子蛊惑的人，在反右派斗争中也会清醒过来，回到人民一边，对右派分子进行斗争的。右派分子利用消灭中的资产阶级的社会基础，篡夺领导权，使时代的车轮向后倒退的企图是注定要失败的。
      我们既要坚决展开对右派的斗争，也要积极帮助共产党整风
    全国人民必须更加紧密团结起来，对右派分子进行坚决的斗争，以巩固党的领导和保卫社会主义事业。我们要同右派分子划清界限，使右派分子处于完全孤立的地位。对于受到右派分子的影响，在思想上有某些错误的人，我们要把他们同右派分子区别开来。他们还是拥护党，愿意走社会主义道路的，只要他们同右派分子划清界限，参加到反右派分子的斗争中来，他们就可以在斗争中受到锻炼，改正错误，和全国人民团结在一起。而对那些坚决反对党，反对社会主义的右派分子，我们必须彻底地给予反击，斗争到底。
    有人认为我们对右派分子展开反击后，人民就不好“放”，不好“鸣”了。这种想法是错误的，主要是由于对党的整风运动缺乏了解所造成的。只要有利于社会主义，而不是不利于社会主义，只要有利于巩固共产党的领导，而不是反对或者削弱共产党的领导，只要在社会主义的共同基础上对党员的作风提意见，无论意见提得怎样尖锐，怎样片面，甚至是有错误的，我认为共产党都是欢迎的。右派分子正在造谣，说党在“收”了，不能讲话了。我们不要听信这种谣言，不要受右派分子的利用，仍要积极帮助党整风。七月一日人民日报社论说：“共产党继续整风，各民主党派也已开始整风。在猖狂进攻的右派被人民打退以后，整风就可以顺利进行了。”党在“收”了吗？决不是的。而且就我所知，凡是为帮助党和政府搞好工作提出的意见，都在加以分析研究，应接受的接受，其中尚有有待于研究的亦有一时办不到的或者有错误的，也都分别说清道理，难道这不是实事求是的精神吗？
    全国人民一定都明白：我们帮助党整风是要使党的领导更加巩固，才可以完成我们社会主义的建设，才可以使我们国家成为一个繁荣富强的社会主义工业国。
    全国人民一定都明白：要达到这个目的，我们要加强学习，提高社会主义觉悟，紧密地团结一致，在工人阶级政党——中国共产党的领导下，坚决地走社会主义的道路。我们对右派分子展开坚决的斗争不是为了别的，正是为了社会主义。社会主义是一定会完全胜利的。
