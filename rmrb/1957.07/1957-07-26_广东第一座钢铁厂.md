Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th: Guangdong Province's first steel and iron integrated plant in history will be built in the suburbs of Guangzhou.

According to the person in charge of relevant departments, after the plant is completed, it will produce 27,500 tons of steel and 8,000 tons of cast iron annually, which can basically meet the needs of industrial production in Guangzhou.

The raw materials required by this plant will be taken from iron ore in the province. Because of local materials and convenient transportation, it will have the advantages of low cost and high efficiency.

Construction of this plant will begin in November of this year and will be completed and put into production by the end of next year. In order to help this plant to be completed as soon as possible, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has agreed to allocate two iron-smelting blast furnaces and send engineering and technical personnel to Guangzhou to assist in the design work.

    广东第一座钢铁厂
    新华社广州25日电  广州市郊将要兴建一座广东省有史以来的第一座钢铁联合工厂。
    据有关方面负责人说，这个厂建成以后，年产钢材两万七千五百吨，铸造生铁八千吨，可以基本上满足广州市工业生产的需要。
    这个厂所需要的原料将取于本省铁矿。由于就地取材，运输方便，将有成本低、收效大的好处。
    这个厂将在今年11月间开始施工，明年年底建成投入生产。为了帮助这座厂早日建成，冶金工业部已经同意拨调两个炼铁高炉，并且派出工程技术人员到广州协助设计工作。
