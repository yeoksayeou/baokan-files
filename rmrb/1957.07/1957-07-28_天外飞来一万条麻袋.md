    A Hundred Thousand Hemp Sacks Fall From The Sky

    On June 19th, the railway station called to inform us that the Lushun-Dalian Oil and Grease Industrial Corporation had sent ten thousand hemp sacks a few days ago, and asked us to pick them up quickly. Strange! We didn't order them, so how could they send us so many hemp sacks? In order to comply with railway regulations and avoid fines, we used more than a dozen small carts and spent a full four or five hours picking up the goods. In order to protect state property, we also emptied the goods in the warehouse to store the hemp sacks.

    Almost two months have passed. We have sent telegrams and letters to the Oil and Grease Industrial Corporation several times, asking them to take the hemp sacks back. Not only did they not send anyone to pick them up, they didn't even reply to our letters. We really don't understand: how exactly are they treating these ten thousand hemp sacks? And we don't understand how they are working for the country?

    天外飞来一万条麻袋
    6月19日，火车站打电话通知我们：前几天旅大油脂工业总厂发来了一万条麻袋，叫赶快去起货。奇怪！我们没订货，他们怎么给发来这么多麻袋呢？为了遵守铁路规章，免得挨罚款，我们用了十几辆小车，足足拉了四、五小时，把货起回来了。为了保护国家财产，我们又把仓库里的货物腾出来装麻袋。
    时间过去快两个月了。我们曾数次给油脂工业总厂打电报、写信，要他们把麻袋领回去。他们不但不来人领取，连信都不回。我们真个不明白：他们究竟怎么对待这一万条麻袋？更不了解他们是怎么在为国家工作的？
