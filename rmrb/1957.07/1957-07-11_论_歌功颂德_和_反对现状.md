    On "Singing Praises" and "Opposing the Status Quo"
    Ruo Shui

    When positions differ, debates inevitably become troublesome, because not only is there no common ground, but even a lack of common language. This isn't to suggest language has a class nature, but rather that the same words or phrases are used in a good sense by one person and in a bad sense by another, often leading to misunderstandings.
    Therefore, words also have their fortunes and misfortunes. Under the rule of reactionary governments, in the mouths of ordinary people, "singing praises" was a bad term, and "opposing the status quo" was a good term; but in the mouths of the ruling class, "singing praises" was a good term, and "opposing the status quo" was a bad term. At that time, those who "sang praises" were seen by the rulers as loyal subjects and good citizens, but by the people as lackeys; those who "opposed the status quo" were seen by the rulers as rebels deserving death, but by the people as revolutionaries, the voice of the people. Why was this so? Because of the different positions.
    The Communist Party led the people in revolution, overthrew the old China, and established the new China, which fundamentally changed the status quo in China – a new status quo replaced the old. As the status quo fundamentally changed, people's attitudes toward the status quo also fundamentally changed. Thus, people felt that they could no longer use "opposing the status quo" in a good sense as they used to, nor could they use terms like "singing praises" in a bad sense as they used to. Why? The reason is simple: the current status quo was established by the people themselves, is fundamentally good, and there are many things that are now worthy of singing praises to.
    But there are still people who hold different views. Yang Yuqing is one of them, and Luo Yiqun is another. For them, the status quo of New China is simply intolerable; the people want to sing praises, but they want to curse. They are particularly dissatisfied with the Party's newspapers, because the Party's newspapers have not catered to their tastes by singing praises to the status quo. Yang Yuqing opened fire on the People's Daily: the editor-in-chief of the People's Daily should step down! Why? The accusation is: the People's Daily has been singing praises all these years! Whether the People's Daily has only been singing praises these years is not discussed here for the moment. Why not discuss it for the moment? Because Yang Yuqing's intention is not to oppose simply singing praises, but to simply oppose singing praises. This is called "singing praises is a crime." Who has the People's Daily been singing praises to? Singing praises to the Party, that is a crime; singing praises to the people, that is a crime; singing praises to socialism, that is a crime. With these three major crimes, shouldn't the editor-in-chief step down? It seems that the Party, the people, and socialism should not be praised under any circumstances, so what attitude should the newspaper take towards these? Yang Yuqing said: oppose the status quo. He didn't say what kind of status quo to oppose, we will clarify it for him, "oppose the status quo" means rebellion. Yang Yuqing declared passionately that he wanted to be a so-called "man of virtue," according to him, "the pen of a writer is naturally against the status quo, a true writer is against the status quo, and good articles from ancient times have opposed the status quo."
    "True writers" still exist today. Professor Huang Wanli of Tsinghua University has a novella opposing the status quo. I don't know if it counts as one of the "good articles from ancient times," but the People's Daily "recommended" it to readers in the "What's the Word" column. This novella is called "Whispers in the Flowerbed." Although it is called whispers, it is actually a big scolding, scolding those Goethean (Goethe means singing praises) scholars as the most shameless, scolding writers as spineless, scolding these scholars as either slaves or coffins (officials). In the present day, singing praises is "shameless," and not singing praises is "having backbone." – This "true writer" has no common language with the majority of the people.
    Of course, we do not believe that all singing praises is good. There are two kinds of people who sing praises now: one is sincere, and the other is insincere. The people see the Communist Party as "benefactors" and "saviors" (although the Communist Party has always opposed the concept of charity and denied "saviors," instead acknowledging that the people save themselves), this is sincere praise. There are also some people (of course, a very small number) whose praise is unnatural, hypocritical, and two-faced. This is not because someone is forcing them to sing praises, but because they are using double-dealing tactics and trying to be opportunistic. The latter kind of people's praise is actually blind flattery, sycophancy, and using the old society's tricks to deal with the Communist Party. Rightists are this kind of people. On the surface, they are singing praises, but behind their backs, they are cursing you as bastards. Luo Yiqun even wrote a seven-character律诗(lǜshī) called "Happy Poem on the Hopeful Bumper Harvest in Agriculture Throughout the Province" at the end of May this year, which even said "Truly knowing that cooperation makes every family happy, the drums of the commune and the village wine never stop," (these are "Goethean" lines of poetry, I don't know if Mr. Huang Wanli thinks it is shameful or shameless?) but before the ink was dry, the same Luo Yiqun shouted the tune that "farmers are on the verge of starvation"! Perhaps in Huang Wanli's view, this is another Mr. "Zhen Wuji"? But I think he should be called "Jia Goethe" or "Zhen Shameless."
    A true Communist Party member never asks others to sing praises to him personally, let alone dislikes flattery and sycophancy. Communist Party members must be vigilant against those sugar-coated bullets, and must also maintain a clear head even in the face of those well-intentioned praises. Communist Party members know that the work they do is insignificant compared to the entire Party, and that nothing can be accomplished without the support of the people. Communist Party members do not like people singing praises to themselves, but they believe that the Party is worthy of singing praises to, and the people are worthy of singing praises to. Comrade Mao Zedong said it well: "Why shouldn't we sing praises to the people, the creators of human world history? Why shouldn't we sing praises to the proletariat, the Communist Party, New Democracy, and Socialism?" ("Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art") True writers, in addition to criticism, must also sing praises, and there are now many good articles that are "singing praises." Yang Yuqing said that "good articles from ancient times opposed the status quo," "from ancient times" may be correct, but "since" is wrong, because the current history has opened a new era.
    Some people also advise us not to only listen to singing praises, but to pay attention to shortcomings. These people's criticisms are correct, and their motives are good. This kind of criticism is different from the criticism of Yang Yuqing and his ilk, we know how to distinguish between these two kinds of criticisms.
    The issue of singing praises must be analyzed, and the issue of opposing the status quo must also be analyzed. Our attitude towards the status quo is dialectical: we are both satisfied and dissatisfied, both affirming and negating. What is our status quo? All the existing conditions of politics, economy, and culture in New China are our status quo. Our status quo contains both good and bad things, the contradiction between the new and the old, the contradiction between growing things and decaying things, the contradiction between good and evil, the contradiction between beauty and ugliness, the contradiction between achievements and shortcomings, and so on. We resolutely maintain all the good things in the status quo, and oppose and overcome all the bad things in the status quo. The rightists are the opposite, they oppose the good things in the status quo and maintain the bad things in the status quo.
    The existence of rightists in our country is also a status quo, and we must oppose this status quo.
    Our status quo has a foundation, and this foundation is the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the Communist Party, which is the socialist system. This is a good thing, it is the lifeblood. Of course, we will definitely negate this status quo in the future. In the future, we will replace socialism with communism, and when the world reaches great harmony, we will also negate the Party. However, we must resolutely maintain it, consolidate it, and develop it now. Our opposition to all bad things in the status quo is also to defend this foundation. Our productivity has developed greatly since liberation, from this point of view we are satisfied, but productivity is still very backward, from this point of view we are not satisfied. Our relations of production are basically advanced socialist relations of production, in this respect we are satisfied, but these relations of production are not perfect, in this respect we are not satisfied. The Party's leadership has made great achievements, in this respect we are satisfied, but the Party's work still has many shortcomings and mistakes, in this respect we are not satisfied. Achievements are the main aspect, so our satisfaction is also the main aspect. But satisfaction is not complacency, the evil wind of the "three evils" cannot be ignored, precisely because of this, the Party decided to carry out rectification. However, overcoming the three evils is also to strengthen the Party's leadership. In our status quo, the positive and newborn things are in a dominant position, which is fundamentally different from the situation in the old China where the reactionary forces were in a dominant position.
    Anyone who is dissatisfied with the status quo always has a vision in mind, and they compare this vision with the status quo to generate dissatisfaction. Our dissatisfaction with the status quo is because we look forward and see the complete victory of socialism, and see communism. There are also people who look backward, they are not only dissatisfied with the status quo, but also fundamentally oppose the status quo. What do they yearn for? Although they didn't say it directly, it is clear from Huang Wanli's article, that is the American capitalist system. They do not oppose the "status quo" of American capitalism, and they do not oppose "singing praises" to American capitalism. Then, the question comes again: do they still count as "true writers," and are they also "the most shameless"?

    论“歌功颂德”和“反对现状”
    若水
    立场一不同，要争论起来总不免麻烦一些，因为不但没有共同观点，甚至还缺乏共同语言。这并不是主张语言有阶级性，只是说，同样的字眼或者词儿，你在好的意义上使用，他在坏的意义上使用，常常说不到一起。
    所以，字眼也有它的幸与不幸。在反动政府统治时期，在老百姓口中，“歌功颂德”是个坏字眼，“反对现状”是个好字眼；但是在统治阶级的嘴里，“歌功颂德”是好字眼，“反对现状”是坏字眼。那时候，“歌功颂德”的人在统治者看来是忠臣良民，在老百姓看来是奴才；“反对现状”的人在统治者看来是造反，要杀头，在老百姓看来是革命者，是人民的喉舌。为什么会这样呢？因为立场不同。
    共产党领导人民起来革命，推翻了旧中国，建立了新中国，这就使中国的现状起了根本的变化——新现状代替了旧现状。现状根本变化了，人们对现状的态度也根本变化了。于是，人们感到不能像从前那样习惯于在好的意义上使用“反对现状”这个词儿了，也不能像从前那样习惯于在坏的意义上使用歌颂一类的字样了。为什么呢？原因很简单：现在的现状是人民自己建立的，在根本上是好的，而现在需要歌颂和值得歌颂的事物也是很多的。
    但是还有人抱着不同的看法。杨玉清就是其中的一个，罗翼群也是其中的一个。对他们说来，新中国这个现状简直是不能忍受，人民要歌颂，而他们要诅咒。他们特别不满意党的报纸，因为党的报纸竟然没有投他们的口味，歌颂了现状。杨玉清向人民日报开了火：人民日报总编辑应该下台！为什么呢？罪状就是：人民日报这几年竟然一直歌功颂德！人民日报这几年是不是只有歌功颂德，这里暂且不论。为什么暂且不论？因为杨玉清的用意并不在反对单纯歌功颂德，而是单纯反对歌功颂德。这叫做“歌颂有罪”。人民日报歌颂了谁呢？歌颂了党，这有罪；歌颂了人民，这有罪；歌颂了社会主义，这有罪。有了这三大罪状，总编辑还不该下台吗？看来对于党、人民、社会主义是无论如何歌颂不得了，那么报纸对这些应该抱什么态度呢？杨玉清说：要反对现状。他没有说要反对什么样的现状，我们替他说明白一些，“反对现状”就是造反。杨玉清慷慨激昂地表示要做所谓“仁人志士”，据他说来，“文人的笔杆天然是反现状的，真正的文人是反现状的，从古以来的好文章是反现状的。”
    “真正的文人”现在还有，清华大学教授黄万里有一篇反现状的小说，算不算“从古以来的好文章”之一我不知道，不过人民日报是在“什么话”这一栏里向读者“推荐”了的。这篇小说叫做“花丛小语”。说是小语，其实是大骂，什么歌德派（歌德者，歌功颂德之谓也）学者最为无耻呀，什么文人多无骨呀，什么这些学者不是奴才便是棺才（官才）呀，都骂出来了。在现在，歌功颂德是“无耻”，不歌功颂德是“有骨气”。——这位“真正的文人”和大多数人民之间是没有共同语言的。
    当然，我们并不认为现在的一切歌功颂德都是好的。现在歌功颂德的有两种人：一种是真心的，一种是假意的。老百姓把共产党看做是“恩人”和“救星”（虽然共产党从来反对恩赐观点，否认“救星”，而是承认人民自己救自己），这是真心的歌颂。还有一种人（这种人当然是很少数）的歌颂却是不自然的，虚伪的，口是心非的。这并不是因为有谁来强迫他们歌功颂德，而是他们自己耍两面手段，想投机。后面这一种人的歌颂实际上是瞎捧场，是阿谀，是把旧社会的一套手腕用来对待共产党。右派就是这种人。他们表面上是歌功颂德，背后是骂你混蛋。罗翼群在今年五月底还写了一首“全省农业丰收有望喜赋”的七言律诗，里面还说“诚知合作家家乐，社鼓村醪日不休”，（这是“歌德派”诗句，不知黄万里先生认为有耻还是无耻？）但是墨迹未干，同一个罗翼群就高呼起“农民已到饿死边缘”的论调来了！也许在黄万里看来这又是一位“甄无忌”先生吧？不过我看倒该叫他“贾歌德”或者“甄无耻”。
    一个真正的共产党员决不要求别人对他个人歌颂，更不消说厌恶奉承阿谀。共产党员对于那些糖衣炮弹，固然要保持警惕，就是对于那些善意的赞扬，也要保持清醒的头脑。共产党员知道，他自己所做的工作，和整个党比起来是微不足道的，而且没有人民群众的支持，是什么事也不能成功的。共产党员不喜欢人们歌颂自己，但他认为，党是值得歌颂的，人民群众是值得歌颂的。毛泽东同志说得好：“对于人民，这个人类世界历史的创造者，为什么不应该歌颂呢？无产阶级，共产党，新民主主义，社会主义，为什么不应该歌颂呢？”（在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话）真正的文人，在现在除了批评以外，一定要歌颂，而现在有很多好文章都是“歌功颂德”的。杨玉清说“从古以来的好文章是反现状的”，“从古”也许是对的，“以来”就错了，因为现在的历史已经开辟一个新纪元了。
    有些人也忠告我们不要只听歌功颂德的话，要注意缺点，这些人的批评是对的，动机也是好的。这种批评同杨玉清之流的批评不同，我们是知道把这两种批评区别开来的。
    对于歌功颂德的问题要分析，对于反对现状的问题也要分析。我们对于现状的态度是辩证的：既满意又不满意，既肯定又否定。我们的现状是什么？新中国的政治、经济、文化的一切现存状况都是我们的现状。我们的现状中既包含着好的东西又包含着坏的东西，包含着新和旧的矛盾，成长着的事物和腐朽着的事物的矛盾，善和恶的矛盾，美和丑的矛盾，成绩和缺点的矛盾，等等。我们坚决维护现状中一切好的东西，反对和克服现状中一切坏的东西。右派分子相反，他们所反对的是现状中的好东西，所维护的是现状中的坏东西。
    在我们的国家里还有右派存在，这也是一种现状，我们就要反对这种现状。
    我们的现状有一个基础，这个基础就是共产党领导下的人民民主专政，就是社会主义制度。这是好的东西，是命根子。当然，将来一定我们也会否定这个现状的。将来我们要用共产主义来代替社会主义，而到了世界大同的时候，我们还要否定党。但是，现在我们却要坚决维护它，巩固它，发展它。我们反对现状中一切坏的事物，也是为了保卫这个基础。我们的生产力比解放前有了巨大的发展，从这方面看我们是满意的，但生产力还是很落后，从这方面看我们又不满意。我们的生产关系基本上是先进的社会主义的生产关系，在这方面我们是满意的，但这个生产关系还不完善，这一方面我们又不满意。党的领导有巨大成绩，这方面我们是满意的，但党的工作还有不少缺点和错误，这方面我们又不满意。成绩是主要的一面，因而我们的满意也是主要的一面。但满意不是满足，“三害”的歪风不能忽视，正因为这样，所以党决定要整风。但是克服三害也是为了加强党的领导。在我们的现状里，正面的新生的东西是居于统治地位的，这和在旧中国反动的势力占统治地位的情况是根本不同的。
    任何不满意现状的人，心目中总有一个憧憬，他拿这个憧憬和现状比较，才会发生不满意。我们对现状有所不满意，是由于我们向前看，看到了社会主义的完全胜利，看到了共产主义。还有一种向后看的人，他们不仅对现状有所不满意，而且根本反对现状。他们憧憬的是什么呢？他们虽没有直说，但是看黄万里的文章也是清楚的，那就是美国的资本主义制度。他们对于美国资本主义的“现状”并不反对，他们对于替美国资本主义“歌功颂德”也并不反对。那么，问题又来了：他们还算不算“真正的文人”，是否也是“最为无耻”呢？
