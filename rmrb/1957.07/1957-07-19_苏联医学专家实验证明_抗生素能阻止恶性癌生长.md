    Moscow Dispatch from our newspaper: In recent years, the Soviet Union has greatly expanded its work in the field of antibiotics. Experiments have proven that antibiotics can inhibit the growth of malignant tumors. This was stated by Soviet antibiotic authorities, Corresponding Academician Gerasimenkov and Yermolyeva, and physician Navashin.
    They said: Finding methods to treat malignant tumors, especially malignant cancer, is the most pressing issue in current medicine. Not long ago, it was believed that there was nothing anti-cancer to be found in antibiotics. Recent research in the Soviet Union, Japan, the United States, and other countries has overturned this view. Many experiments have proven that many agents can inhibit the growth of various malignant tumors. It is possible to use anti-cancer agents in combination with other therapies to treat cancer most effectively. It is also possible that new results will be researched in the near future. They said: Existing antibiotics are not yet able to treat many viral diseases, including poliomyelitis. There are also no very effective agents for influenza, skin diseases, etc. These problems should become the central focus of Soviet medical scientists when searching for new antibiotics. Antibiotics are not only used in medicine, but the prospects for using antibiotics in agriculture and the food industry are also very broad. Antibiotics can be used to stimulate feed growth, promote livestock to grow more meat, increase the egg production rate of chickens and ducks, reduce livestock and crop diseases, and preserve canned food for longer.
    Now, in addition to the two Antibiotics Research Institutes in Moscow, specialized research institutes have also been established in Leningrad and Sverdlovsk, and new laboratories have been opened in some universities. The production of antibiotic agents is increasing day by day. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, the production of penicillin increased by ten and a half times, and the production of streptomycin increased by forty-five times. By 1960, the production of antibiotics will be six times that of 1955.

    苏联医学专家实验证明
    抗生素能阻止恶性癌生长
    本报莫斯科讯  苏联在最近几年大大扩展了抗生素方面的工作。实验证明，用抗生素能阻止恶性癌的生长。这是苏联抗生素权威通讯院士格拉先科夫和叶尔莫列娃、医师纳瓦辛说的。
    他们说：寻找治疗恶性肿瘤首先是恶性癌的方法，是当前医学中最迫切的问题。不久以前还认为，在抗生素中找不到抗癌的东西。最近几年在苏联、日本、美国和其他国家的研究推翻了这种看法。许多实验证明，许多药剂能阻止各种恶性肿瘤的生长。有可能用抗癌剂结合其他疗法来治癌最有效。也有可能在不远将来研究出新的结果。他们说：现有的抗生素还不能够治疗许多病毒疾病包括脊髓灰质炎。对于流行性感冒、皮肤病等等也还没有十分有效的药剂。这些问题应该成为苏联医学家寻找新的抗生素时注意的中心。抗生素不仅仅用在医药上，在农业和食品工业上采用抗生素的前途也非常广阔。抗生素可以用来刺激饲料的生长，促使牲畜多长肉，提高鸡鸭的生蛋率、减少牲畜和作物的病害，把食品罐头保存得更久。
    现在除了在莫斯科有两个抗生素研究所，在列宁格勒和斯维尔德洛夫斯克也建立了专门的研究所，在某些高等学校里还开辟了新的实验所。抗生素药剂的产量一天天增多。在第五个五年计划时期，青霉素的产量增长了十倍半，链霉素的产量增长了四十五倍。到1960年抗生素的产量将为1955年的六倍。
