Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 19th: The French monthly "New Democracy" recently published an article by Claudin, a member of the Political Bureau of the Spanish Communist Party, entitled "The Crisis in Madrid." The article points out that the Spanish government crisis that broke out in February this year shows that the Franco dictatorship is approaching its end.

The author points out that the direct cause of the crisis was, of course, the extremely deteriorating economic situation. However, the decisive factor was the powerful mass movement that not only put forward economic demands but also demanded extensive political reforms: demanding democracy. In January and February, large-scale people's demonstrations took place in major cities such as Madrid and Barcelona. Leaflets distributed to residents openly called for the abolition of the dictatorship and the implementation of democratic reforms.

In order to save themselves, Franco and his followers reorganized the government, reducing the number of Falangist ministers in the government. However, this trick played in the "government crisis" can never deceive people.

The article points out: Emphasizing the militarism and pro-American policy of the dictatorship is one of the basic characteristics of the policy announced by the "new government." After the "new government" was formed, activities advocating "monarchical autocracy" were strengthened. The issue of restoring the monarchy has been openly raised. On the second day of the establishment of the "new government," more than 400 royalists held a meeting in Madrid.

The new government also plans to devalue the peseta as a "start" to solving economic problems.

These deceptive methods can no longer play a significant role. The mass movements of workers, peasants, university students, and the middle class are constantly developing and growing. The Franco government is most afraid of the leading role played by the working class and its party, the Communist Party, in this movement.

The Spanish Communist Party Political Bureau's statement on February 9th analyzing the significance of the people's marches and demonstrations in Madrid and Barcelona has been widely commented on by all Spanish newspapers. Official newspapers attempted to use this to intimidate those conservative and liberal figures. However, after eighteen years, experience has greatly reduced its "intimidating characteristics."

However, this does not mean underestimating the efforts and schemes that hinder the unity of anti-Franco forces. Among the leaders of these forces, especially within the Republican and Socialist parties in exile, some are still afraid of the people, hold narrow plans for one party, and dream of reorganizing the current situation by abandoning the communists.

The author concludes by saying that the Communist Party, relying on the mass movement, will do everything possible to resist this kind of resistance, and reiterates that all anti-Franco forces must seek unity and plan for a broad, peaceful, nationwide demonstration to show the firm position of the vast majority of Spaniards against the dictatorship and their desire to remove obstacles to expressing the will of the people for freedom.

### 西共政治局委员克拉乌丁指出：西班牙群众运动壮大佛朗哥政权日暮途穷

    西共政治局委员克拉乌丁指出：
    西班牙群众运动壮大佛朗哥政权日暮途穷
    据新华社19日讯　巴黎消息：法国“新民主”月刊最近刊登了西班牙共产党政治局委员克拉乌丁的一篇题为“马德里的危机”的文章。文章指出：今年2月爆发的西班牙政府危机表明，佛朗哥独裁政权已经日暮途穷。
    作者指出，危机的直接导因固然是经济情况极度恶化。但是，决定性的因素是强大的群众运动不仅提出了经济的要求，而且要求进行广泛的政治改革：要求民主。1月和2月先后在马德里、巴塞罗那等大城市发生了盛大的人民示威。在散发给居民的传单中，公开提出了取消独裁和实行民主改革的口号。
    佛朗哥及其党徒为了挽救自身，就改组了政府，减少了长枪党在政府中所占的部长职位。但是，这种在“政府危机”中玩弄的花招，是永远欺骗不了人的。
    文章指出：强调独裁政权的军国主义和亲美方针是“新政府”宣布的政策的基本特点之一。“新政府”组成以后，鼓吹“君主专制”的活动加强了。恢复君主专制的问题已经公开提出来了。在“新政府”成立的第二天，四百多名保皇派分子在马德里举行了会议。
    新政府还打算使比塞塔贬值，作为解决经济问题的“开端”。
    这些欺骗手法已经不能发生多大的作用。工人、农民、大学生和中产阶级的群众运动正在不断发展和壮大。佛朗哥政府最害怕工人阶级和它的政党——共产党——在这个运动中所起的领导作用。
    西班牙共产党政治局在2月9日关于分析马德里和巴塞罗那人民游行示威的意义的声明受到西班牙所有报纸广泛评论。官方报纸企图借此来恐吓那些保守和自由主义人士。但是十八年来，经验已经使得它大大地失去了“吓唬人的特性”。
    但是，这并不意味着要低估那种阻碍反佛朗哥力量团结起来的努力和计谋。在这种力量的领导中，特别是在流亡国外的共和党和社会党等党派内，有一些人还是害怕人民，抱着一个党的狭隘打算，他们梦想抛开共产党人整顿目前的局面。
    作者最后说，共产党依靠群众运动尽一切可能抵制这种反抗，并重申一切反佛朗哥的力量必须求得一致，并筹划广泛的和平性质的全民大示威，显示绝大多数的西班牙人反对独裁的坚定立场和他们为人民自由表示意志扫除障碍的愿望。
