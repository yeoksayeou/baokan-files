Xinhua News Agency, July 25th: Major rivers across the country have now entered the peak flood season. Because the rainfall areas are located in the Yellow River basin, the Shaying River basin (a tributary of the Huai River), and the upper reaches of the Yi and Shu Rivers, the main streams of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers have not yet experienced severe flooding. The water situation in the Hai River in North China and the Liao and Songhua Rivers in Northeast China is also basically stable. The flood peak of over 10,000 cubic meters per second at Huayuankou on the Yellow River has not yet flowed into the sea. A flood peak appeared on the tributary DaWen River yesterday, and the water level of Dongping Lake is still relatively high. The water levels of the Ying River and the Wo River (tributaries of the Huai River) are gradually receding. The water level of the Pearl River in South China is currently low.

Due to rainfall in areas such as Sichuan, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and its tributaries, the Jialing River and the Han River, once showed an upward trend. In mid-July, the Han River also experienced a major flood peak, and the water level from Xincheng to Wuhan in the lower reaches exceeded the local warning level.

Except for some changes in the water levels of tributaries such as the Ying River and the Wo River, the main stream of the Huai River has not changed significantly, and the water level is relatively normal.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 25th: Continuous rainfall has occurred in the basins of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and its tributaries, and flood peaks will continuously appear in the Yellow River.

The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters issued an emergency instruction yesterday, requiring stronger flood prevention measures. The instructions included: First, seize the time during the flood lull to inspect and repair dikes, replenish flood control materials, improve flood control organizations, and rectify flood control teams. Second, prepare for flood diversion and detention in case of extraordinarily large floods, and relocate and resettle people in the beach areas and already flooded areas with a high sense of responsibility.

    全国主要河流进入汛期
    长江汉水出现首次较大洪峰
    黄河中、下游洪峰又将出现
    据新华社25日讯　现在全国各主要河流都进入了大汛时期，由于雨区在黄河流域、淮河支流沙颍河流域和沂沭河上游地区，所以长江和淮河干流都还没有发生严重汛情。华北的海河，东北的辽河和松花江的水情也还是基本平稳的。黄河花园口一万秒公方以上流量的洪峰尚未下泄入海，支流大汶河昨天有洪峰出现，东平湖的水位还比较高。淮河支流颍河和涡河的水位都逐渐回落。华南珠江目前水位较低。
    由于四川等地下雨，长江上游及其支流嘉陵江、汉水等曾一度呈涨势。7月中旬，汉水也出现一次较大的洪峰，下游新城到武汉间的水位都突破了当地警戒水位。
    淮河除支流颍河和涡河等水位还有些变化外，干流无大变化，水位比较正常。
    据新华社郑州25日电　黄河中下游干支流流域又连续降雨，黄河又将连续出现洪峰。
    黄河防汛总指挥部在昨天就发出防御更大洪水的紧急指示要求：首先抓紧洪水间歇时间，检查和整修堤坝，充实防汛器材，健全防汛机构，整顿防汛队伍；其次，作好一旦发生特大洪水时的分洪滞洪准备工作，并以高度负责的精神做好滩区和已滞洪区群众的迁移安置工作。
