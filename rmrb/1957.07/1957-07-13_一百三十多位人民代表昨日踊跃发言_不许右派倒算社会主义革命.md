Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: The Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress continued its general discussion this morning and afternoon.

The representatives continued to use vivid facts from socialist construction and socialist transformation in various regions and fields to refute the various reactionary words and deeds of the rightists against socialism and the Party. Some representatives who had lost their people's stand and spread rightist erroneous remarks made self-criticisms at the meeting today.

Seventy-one representatives spoke in the morning.

Huang Changshui, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and Director of the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, explained the drastically different status of overseas Chinese at home and abroad before and after liberation in his speech, and expressed his gratitude for the people's government's consistent concern for the interests of overseas Chinese and domestic relatives of overseas Chinese.

Jin Zhonghua, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, exposed and analyzed the rampant conspiracies of rightists in Shanghai to oppose the Communist Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism. He said that these ugly rightists have been exposed under the fierce counterattack of the Shanghai people. Now they should make a thorough explanation to the people and pour out all the dirty things.

Shao Lizi, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that the nationwide struggle against rightists currently being carried out enthusiastically demonstrates that the people of the whole country resolutely support the Constitution of the socialist type. He expressed that he will better study Marxism in the future, constantly transform himself, draw a clear line with the rightists, and unswervingly follow the Chinese Communist Party and take the road of socialism. Shao Lizi also suggested in his speech that planned childbearing should be realized as soon as possible. He particularly emphasized the vigorous promotion of birth control in rural areas.

Li Renren, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province, delivered a joint speech on behalf of ten representatives: Chen Cisheng, Mo Naiqun, Lei Rongke, Jiang Zaiqiu, Mo Shouquan, Yang Wengui, Chen Jiyi, Zhao Lequn, and Lan Changfa. They expressed their heartfelt support for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's proposal to establish the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Patihan Sugurbayev, Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, spoke on the implementation of ethnic policies in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. He said that after liberation, the Party's ethnic policies were correctly implemented in Xinjiang, fundamentally changing the old ethnic relations and establishing new ethnic relations of equality, unity, and friendship.

Deng Yuzhi, General Secretary of the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China, said that Chinese Christians love their country, wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Communist Party, resolutely draw a clear line with the rightists, and launch a struggle against the influence of the rightists within Christianity.

Ye Duyi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, exposed Luo Longji's consistent anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and actions from history to the present, and also criticized his own series of erroneous views at the meeting.

Han Zhao'e, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, reviewed the facts that he expanded the position for the Zhang-Luo alliance in Shaanxi, as well as some of Zhang Bojun's anti-communist and anti-socialist facts. He said that even after arriving in Beijing this time, he was instructed by Zhang Bojun to meet with leading comrades, trying to test the handling of Zhang Bojun's problem and trying to extricate Zhang Bojun, which was extremely wrong. He expressed that he would now resolutely draw a clear ideological and political line with Zhang Bojun and others.

Fifty-four other representatives made written statements this morning.

Lan Gongwu, Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Bao Erhan, Chairman of the China Islamic Association, Guan Wenwei, Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province, Xu Kai, Director of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources, Tao Shufan, Vice Principal of the Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University, Zhang Lisheng, Counselor of the State Council, Ma Xingtai, Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhang Yun, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Liu Jingfan, Deputy Minister of Geology, writer Xie Bingxin, Wang Baozhen, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, representatives from Fujian Province Liu Yongsheng, Lin Yixin, Li Zhizhong, Hou Zhenya, Zheng Yibo, Xie Xuehong, Deng Baoshan, Governor of Gansu Province, Zhao Jianmin, Governor of Shandong Province, and Gui Yanfang, Director of the Shanghai Transportation Bureau, and other representatives, from the achievements of work in various regions and fields, from the results of inspections and personal experiences, sternly refuted the anti-socialist words and deeds of the bourgeois rightists.

Song Zichun, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, Wu Yunshan, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, Pan Erchang, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, and representatives Lu Dinghua, Fu Zicheng, and others, also focused on criticizing Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks in their written statements.

Tian Demin specifically exposed the fact that Huang Shaohong "appealed for justice" for the counter-revolutionary element Han Guoping.

Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the National Association for Science and Technology Popularization, Wang Yunsheng, President of Ta Kung Pao, and Che Xiangchen, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, mentioned in their written statements the great educational significance of the struggle against rightists for scientific and technological workers, journalists, school teachers, and young students.

Tao Zhiyue, Deputy Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wang Huzhen, Chief Engineer of the Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources, Li Weiguang, Acting Archbishop of the Nanjing Diocese of the Catholic Church, and Hu Wenyuan, Vice President of Shanghai Second Medical College, Luo Mingyi, President of South China Institute of Technology, and Lin Keming, Director of Guangzhou Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, medical workers Xu Zuoxia, Ke Lin, Huang Jiasi, Zhang Yangfen, medical workers Wang Shuzhen, Lin Qiaozhi, He Bihui, Yu Aifeng, Zhang Qinqiu, Deputy Minister of Textile Industry, Shu Xincheng, Director of the Finance and Economics Publishing House, Li Guowei, Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Yang Junsheng, General Manager of China Shipbuilding Factory, and shipbuilding engineer Sa Benxin, Shi Zenrong, Professor of Harbin Medical College, Wang Wending, Director of Chengdu Health Association, Ma Jian, Professor of Peking University, Li Yanlu, Vice Governor of Heilongjiang Province, Zaxi Wangxu, Vice Governor of Qinghai Province, Zheng Zhenduo, Deputy Minister of Culture, and other representatives, reported on the work of their respective regions and departments, and put forward criticisms and suggestions on the work in relevant fields in their written statements.

The executive chairmen of the morning session were: Luo Ronghuan, Li Xuefeng, Liu Geping, Rong Yiren, Cui Jiangong, Shu Sheyu, Li Jinxi, Sangji Yuexi, and Zhu Shunyu.

Sixty-seven representatives, including Li Jishen, continued to speak at the conference this afternoon.

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, was the first to speak. In his speech, he criticized the bourgeois rightists. He said that in order to consolidate the Party's leadership, to defend the socialist cause, and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and the unity of the people of the whole country, we must thoroughly expose and resolutely struggle against these rightists.

Shi Liang, Minister of Justice, firmly refuted the rightists' vicious attacks on the people's judicial work. She said that the rightist Huang Shaohong used his legal status to openly "appeal for injustice" for counter-revolutionary elements and exonerate counter-revolutionary elements, which is illegal behavior. The "Rehabilitation Committee" that Luo Longji wanted to establish violated the Constitution's provision that the power of trial is uniformly exercised by the people's courts. She said that we resolutely suppressed counter-revolutionary activities in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, and the rightists' opposition to our eliminating counter-revolutionaries is completely in vain.

Li Zhuchen, Executive Vice Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, revealed in his speech Zhang Naiqi's despicable aim of attempting to alienate and provoke industrialists and businessmen from the Party and the government. He pointed out the serious harm of the poison spread by the rightists to the industrial and commercial circles.

Yang Dongchun focused on the issue of ideological remolding of intellectuals in connection with the anti-rightist struggle in his speech. He analyzed that the most fundamental reason for the confusion of thought among intellectuals in the anti-rightist struggle is that intellectuals have not undergone practical training in the socialist revolution stage and have not withstood severe tests in the fiery mass struggle. Therefore, the position of some intellectuals has not yet changed. Yang Dongchun said that in the past seven years, the ideological level of intellectuals has improved to some extent, but this progress should not be overestimated. The great exposure of ideological confusion in the intellectual circles in the anti-rightist struggle is a very painful lesson. All progressive, kind, upright, and patriotic revolutionary intellectuals must further strengthen their ideological remolding and completely change their positions and worldviews under the leadership of the Party and in the mass struggle against rightists.

Fifteen ethnic minority representatives from Yunnan made a joint speech. They are: Dao Jingban (Dai), Zhao Cunxin (Dai), Yu Haiqing (Yi), Li Guanghua (Lahu), Li Hecai (Hani), Li Guiying (female, Yi), He Wanbao (Naxi), Hu Zhonghua (Kawa), Zhang Zizhai (Bai), Pei Aqian (Lisu), Lei Chunguo (Jingpo), Zhao Chongqi (Hui), Xiong Kaiyou (Miao), Long Mingchuan (Nong), and Gong Shou (Dai). Zhang Zizhai read the joint statement. In their joint speech, the fifteen representatives sternly denounced Long Yun's anti-Soviet fallacies and attempts to alienate ethnic minorities from the Party, and refuted Long Yun's reactionary theories of ethnic minority abolitionism and assimilationism.

The joint statement exposed the monstrous crimes committed by Long Yun during his rule in Yunnan. The joint statement said that the period of Long Yun's rule was the darkest period in Yunnan's history. He turned multi-ethnic Yunnan into a dark "ethnic prison" and a world-famous "opium kingdom." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, gold, U.S. dollars, and opium were the so-called "three treasures," and Long Yun was a major household of these "three treasures." The people called him the "Three Treasures Eunuch" (laughter continued to erupt throughout the audience at this point). It was at that time that Long Yun deposited a large amount of money he had plundered in American banks. The joint statement said that since liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan have not seriously settled old scores with Long Yun, only hoping that he would lean towards the people and do something good for the people. Even if he could not do good, he should not do bad things again. However, Long Yun did not receive the education he deserved from the people's forgiveness, and has remained stubborn, adhering to his reactionary position of landlord, bureaucratic, and bourgeois classes. The joint statement warned Long Yun: You must repent and surrender to the people and be a new person; otherwise, the people will never allow it.

Wang Guangying, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, revealed that Bi Mingqi and Zhang Naiqi echoed each other and made a series of absurd remarks against the leadership of the working class and against socialist transformation during the rectification movement.

Overseas Chinese representatives Yi Meihou, Su Zhenshou, Zhou Zheng, Wu Chan, Xie Yingrui, Ma Yusheng, Wu Huanxing, Wu Yixiu, Liao Sheng, Fang Junzhuang and other ten people made a joint written statement entitled "Overseas Chinese Resolutely Support the Socialist System." The statement said: Our overseas Chinese representatives have received a joint notice from the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Federations of Returned Overseas Chinese, requesting the National People's Congress to thoroughly crack down on all the vicious attempts of the rightists.

The composer He Luting offered opinions in his written statement on how to establish a system in organs, organizations, and schools to ensure that everyone can work actively.

National agricultural labor models Li Shunda, Wu Chun'an, Shen Jilan, Guo Yu'en, and Qu Yaoli expressed in a joint written statement that they welcome middle and high school graduates to return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

Yang Tingbao, Lin Keming, Zhu Zhaoxue, and Liang Sicheng, four representatives engaged in urban planning, architectural design, and architectural education, made a joint written statement on specific issues such as architectural work and urban planning, and put forward criticisms and suggestions.

Others who spoke individually or jointly or made written statements at the afternoon meeting today included: Wang Yizhai, Vice Governor of Henan Province, Lin Wenbiao, Chief Engineer of the Rubber Industry Management Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry, Lin Zhicheng, Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Lin Qiangyun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Yang Ziheng, Director of the Gansu Provincial Department of Transportation, Zai Tao, Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Xie Lihui and Ke Zhao, educators in institutions of higher learning, Sun Dehe, Chief Design Engineer of the Anshan General Institute of Design of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Li Zhuchen, Minister of the Ministry of Food Industry, Bai Yang, a famous film actress, Xu Xiaobing, a film worker, Liu Yingyuan, Li Yong, Li Shusen, Liu Dezhen, Liu Shimei, Huang Runping, and Guo Shude, industrial labor models, Liu Changsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Yang Xiandong, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture, Lan Tian, Engineer of the Southwest Design Branch of the Ministry of Railways, Zhao Zukang, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, Wang Guangying, Secretary-General of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Zhu Jisheng, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, Yang Weiyi, President of Jiangxi Agricultural College, Wang De'an, Governor of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture of Guizhou Province.

The executive chairmen of the afternoon session were: Shen Junru, Lin Feng, Lai Ruoyu, Xiong Kewu, Hu Heletei, Lin Qiaozhi, Chen Yuan, and Rao Xingli.

    不许右派倒算社会主义革命
    据新华社12日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天分上午下午继续进行大会讨论。
    代表们继续用各地区各方面社会主义建设和社会主义改造的生动事实，批驳了右派分子反社会主义反党的种种反动言行。有的代表曾经丧失人民立场，散布过右派错误言论，今天在会上作了检讨。
    上午发言的代表共七十一人。

    上海市副市长金仲华揭露和分析了右派分子在上海进行的反共、反人民、反社会主义的猖狂的阴谋活动。他说，这些丑恶的右派分子在上海人民的猛烈反击下原形毕露了，现在他们应该向人民彻底交代，把所有肮脏的东西倒出来。
    民革中央常务委员邵力子说，目前全国人民热烈地进行着的对右派分子的斗争，说明全国人民坚决拥护属于社会主义类型的宪法。他表示今后要更好地学习马克思主义，不断改造自己，同右派分子划清界限，坚定不移地跟着中国共产党，走社会主义的道路。邵力子在发言中还建议尽快地实现有计划的生育孩子。他特别强调要在农村中大力推行节育工作。

    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深第一个发言。他在发言中批判了资产阶级右派分子。他说，为了巩固党的领导，为了保卫社会主义事业，为了巩固无产阶级专政和全国人民的团结，我们必须向这些右派分子进行彻底的揭发和坚决的斗争。
    司法部部长史良对右派分子向人民司法工作的恶毒攻击进行了坚决的驳斥。她说，右派分子黄绍竑利用合法地位，公开替反革命分子“鸣冤”，为反革命分子开脱罪行，是违法的行为。罗隆基所要成立的“平反委员会”，是违反了宪法关于审判权统一由人民法院行使的规定。她说，我们按照宪法的规定坚决镇压了反革命的活动，右派分子反对我们肃清反革命，完全是徒劳的。
    中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会的常务副主任委员李烛尘在发言中揭露了章乃器企图离间挑拨工商业者与党和政府的关系的卑鄙目的，他指出了右派分子散播的毒素对工商界的严重危害。
    杨东莼在发言中联系反右派斗争着重谈到了知识分子的思想改造问题。他分析了知识界在反右派斗争中产生混乱思想的最根本原因，是知识分子在社会主义革命阶段中没有经过实际的锻炼，没有在火热的群众斗争中承受严峻的考验。因而，一部分知识分子的立场还没有转变。杨东莼说，七年来，知识分子的思想水平是有所提高的，但是这种进步不能估计过高。在反右派斗争中，知识界思想混乱情况的大暴露，是一次十分惨痛的教训。一切追求进步的、善良正直的、爱国的革命知识分子，必须在党的领导下，在反右派的群众斗争中，进一步加强思想改造，彻底改变自己的立场和世界观。
    来自云南的十五位少数民族代表作了联合发言，他们是：刀京版（傣族）、召存信（傣族）、余海清（彝族）、李光华（拉祜族）、李和才（哈尼族）、李桂英（女、彝族）、和万宝（纳西族）、胡忠华（佧佤族）、张子斋（白族）、裴阿欠（傈僳族）、雷春国（景颇族）、赵偅奇（回族）、熊开友（苗族）、龙明传（侬族）、龚绶（傣族）。联合发言由张子斋宣读。十五位代表在联合发言中严正斥责了龙云的反苏谬论和企图离间少数民族同党的关系的阴谋活动，驳斥了龙云的少数民族取消论和同化论的反动论调。
    联合发言揭露了龙云统治云南时期犯下的滔天罪行。联合发言说，龙云统治时期，是云南历史上最黑暗的一个时期，他把多民族的云南，变成暗无天日的“民族监狱”，变成举世闻名的“鸦片王国”。在抗战时期，黄金、美钞、鸦片是所谓的“三宝”，而龙云就是这“三宝”的大户，人民称之为“三宝太监”（这时全场不断发出笑声）。就在那个时候，龙云曾把他搜刮的大批金钱存到美国银行。联合发言说，解放以来，云南各族人民并未认真同龙云算旧账，只希望他靠拢人民，为人民做点好事，即使做不了好事，也不要再做坏事。但是龙云并没有从人民的宽恕里得到应有的教育，一直冥顽不灵，坚持其地主官僚资产阶级的反动立场。联合发言警告龙云：必须幡然悔悟，向人民投降，重新作人；否则，人民是绝不能允许的。
    天津市工商业联合会秘书长王光英揭露了毕鸣岐和章乃器一唱一和，在整风中发表一系列反对工人阶级领导、反对社会主义改造的荒谬言论。
    华侨代表蚁美厚、苏振寿、周铮、伍禅、谢应瑞、马玉声、吴桓兴、吴益修、廖胜、方君壮等十人作了题为“华侨坚决拥护社会主义制度”的联合书面发言。发言中说：我们华侨代表已经接到广东省和广州市的归国华侨联合会的联合通知，要求全国人民代表大会彻底打击右派分子的一切恶毒企图。
