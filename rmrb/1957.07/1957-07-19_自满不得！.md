    Complacency is Unacceptable!
    On July 8th, the Anhui Daily published an editorial titled "Complacency is Unacceptable," addressing the complacency among farmers due to the bumper harvest of summer crops and the good growth of autumn crops.

    The editorial stated that, based on the current situation, autumn crops across the province are generally growing well, with some crops even exceeding the planned planting area. However, economic crops such as summer corn, sweet potatoes, cotton, and tobacco have not met the planned planting area. In particular, some areas have experienced insect infestations. Therefore, we have no reason to be complacent.

    The editorial pointed out that the proportion of the summer harvest in the annual harvest is not large (about one-quarter). Although some counties had a bumper summer harvest, they did not complete the summer grain production plan because the winter planting area last year was smaller than in previous years. Especially in the polder areas along the Yangtze River, the summer harvest was not very good due to the heavy rain this spring. This increases the task of autumn production. July and August are the rainy season in Anhui Province, and it is too early to be certain that "a bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion."

    The editorial believes that in order to strive for a bumper autumn harvest, it is necessary not only to solve the ideological obstacle of complacency but also to immediately mobilize and do the following tasks well:

    First, seize the time, concentrate all forces, and complete the summer planting as soon as possible in a comprehensive manner. We should immediately check the current summer planting work. Check which crops have been planted according to plan? Which ones have not been planted? What are the reasons for not planting in time? How to remedy it, etc. At the same time, it is necessary to help communes and teams solve specific difficulties. The weather is changeable in July. Experience tells us that planting one day earlier means one more percent of harvest. All localities should concentrate all their efforts, take advantage of the moisture to rush to plant, and complete the summer planting task.

    Second, in the Huainan and Jiangnan areas, early rice has headed and flowered, and it will be fully harvested in half a month. Harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice is the busiest season. We must learn from the lesson of neglecting one thing for another last year and make proper arrangements for labor and livestock as soon as possible to ensure that we can harvest early rice in a timely manner, transplant late rice at the right time, and do a good job in the field management of mid-season rice.

    Third, strengthen field management of autumn crops. Anhui Province currently has more than 20 million mu of mid-season rice and more than 20 million mu of dry-land crops such as soybeans, as well as 12 million mu of sweet potatoes to be planted, all of which require timely weeding, topdressing, pest control, wind prevention, and flood prevention. Some people, holding the idea that "the sixth month is not busy," have relaxed field management. Some communes lack inspection and supervision in promoting the personal responsibility system for field management. These phenomena should be corrected. Anhui Province has not completed the cotton planting task according to plan this year and can only rely on strengthening the management of cotton fields and increasing the yield of cotton per unit area to complete this year's cotton production task.

### 自满不得！

    自满不得！
    7月8日安徽日报针对农民在午季丰收，秋季作物生长良好而产生的自满情绪发表了社论，题目是“自满不得”。
    社论说，就目前情况来看，全省秋季作物一般说是生长良好的，有的作物并且超过了计划播种面积。但是，夏玉米、山芋、棉花、烟叶等经济作物都未能按计划完成播种面积。特别是有些地区发生了虫害，因此，我们没有任何理由可以产生麻痹自满情绪。
    社论指出，午季收成在全年收成中的比重是不大的（四分之一左右）。有些县午季虽然丰收，但由于去年冬播面积比往年缩小了一些，并未能完成午季粮食生产计划。特别在沿江圩区，因为今春多雨，午季收成也并不太好。这就加重了秋季的生产任务。七、八月是安徽省多雨季节，现在就肯定“丰收已成定局”未免过早了。
    社论认为，争取秋季大丰收，不但要解决自满的思想障碍，还必须立即动员起来作好以下几件工作。
    第一，抓紧时间，集中一切力量，尽快地全面的完成夏种。当前夏种工作究竟如何，应当立即检查。检查那些作物按计划种完了？那些没有种完？没有及时种完的原因在那里？如何进行补救等等，同时要帮助社、队解决具体困难。7月里天气多变，经验告诉我们，早种一天就多一成收成。各地应集中一切力量，趁墒抢种，完成夏种任务。
    第二，淮南、江南地区早稻已抽穗扬花，半月后就可全面收割，收早稻栽晚稻，正是最繁忙的季节，必须接受去年顾此失彼的教训，及早的作好劳动力和畜力的妥善安排，保证既能及时收割早稻，又能适时插栽晚稻，还要做好中稻的田间管理工作。
    第三，加强秋季作物的田间管理。安徽省现有二千多万亩中稻和两千多万亩黄豆等旱粮作物，还有即将栽下的一千二百万亩山芋，都需要适时的进行锄草、追肥、防虫、防风和防涝等各项田间管理工作。有些人抱着“清水六月活不忙”的思想，放松了田间管理，有的社在推行田间管理个人负责制的工作中，缺乏检查和监督。这些现象都应当纠正。安徽省今年没有按计划完成植棉任务，只有依赖于加强棉田的管理，提高棉花单位面积产量来完成今年的棉花生产任务。
