Chen Mingshu Publicly Slanders Chairman Mao
Revolutionary Committee Central Group Unanimously Denounces Chen Mingshu's Arrogance and Shamelessness

(Our newspaper’s dispatch) On the morning of July 14th, the Revolutionary Committee Central Group held its 14th expanded meeting, once again exposing and criticizing Chen Mingshu's reactionary words and deeds. Speaking at the meeting were Li Jishen, Wu Maosun, Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, Chen Qiyuan, Gan Cisen, Nie Hong, Zhu Yunshan, Zhou Fanwen, Yu Zhenying, Zhao Zukang, Mei Gongbin, Zhu Xuefan, Shao Hengqiu, and others.

Wu Maosun focused on exposing Chen Mingshu's recent reactionary remarks slandering Chairman Mao, which aroused great indignation among the participants. Wu Maosun said: According to the revealed materials, Chen Mingshu openly compared Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the people of the whole country, to Bismarck of Germany and Ito Hirobumi of Japan. He described Chairman Mao as having "the faults of being ardent but not calm, hasty but not relaxed, agitated but difficult to settle, and observant but difficult to be thorough in his personal cultivation, which inevitably affect the wise judgment of observing people and listening to their words, making decisions, and determining plans, as well as the disproportionate emphasis and imbalance in policies and measures."

Chen Mingshu smeared Chairman Mao as "being fond of boasting and eager for success" and wanted Chairman Mao to "conduct more in-depth investigation to seek the truth." He said that Chairman Mao sometimes "is swayed by joy and anger, and in the heat of the moment, readily hurts the self-esteem and inherent status of senior cadres." He said that Chairman Mao "lightly believes in cadres' false reports and dogmatic analysis methods, and makes radical decisions without serious and detailed research." He believed that Chairman Mao "excessively despises the old" and "still disrespects classical literature," his basis being Chairman Mao's letter to Zang Kejia, in which he said, "Because it is old-style poetry, I am afraid that erroneous kinds will spread and mislead young people."

Chen Mingshu also slandered that the non-Party people Chairman Mao contacted were mostly "flatterers." He believed that "some people from the old China" "take credit for the work of Heaven, receive undeserved praise, and are filled with fame-seekers and parasites," and that they "use revolution as a guise to conceal flattery."

Chen Mingshu's unbridled attacks and slanders against Chairman Mao, the most beloved leader of the people of the whole country, aroused unparalleled indignation among everyone. Many people severely condemned his absurd words and deeds in their speeches.

Li Jishen said: Chen Mingshu is a very vile political careerist; he loves what evil people love and hates what good people hate.

Li Jishen said in his speech: Whether before or after liberation, Chen Mingshu had no intention of serving the people and the country. He proceeded from himself in everything and一心 (all of one heart) wanted to be a leader. Chen Mingshu shamelessly believed that he led every revolution before liberation, stole the credit of the people's revolution as his own, and even issued pamphlets to boast about himself. At the graduation ceremony of the North China Revolutionary University in 1951, the Central Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee sent Comrade Shao Lizi to represent the Revolutionary Committee, but Chen Mingshu went to speak without authorization, resulting in great dissatisfaction among the masses. Chen is full of Marxism-Leninism, but in reality, he is promoting his incoherent Buddhist idealism. During the Second Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee, Chen Mingshu provoked relationships everywhere, invited guests, wooed people, attacked others, and elevated himself, attempting to use comrades to support him as the leader of the Revolutionary Committee. In order to seize the leadership position of the Revolutionary Committee, he seized the three local organizations in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan, created personnel disputes, recognized enemies as friends, cultivated personal power, and caused great losses to the three local organizations.

When Chen Mingshu worked in Wuhan, he fabricated facts, wrote poems to insult the Communist Party, distributed them everywhere, and said that the guards were monitoring him. I want to ask Chen Mingshu: What secrets do you have? If you have no secrets, why do you suspect that the Communist Party sent people to monitor you? I ask you, what is your intention in slandering the Party so viciously?

Li Jishen said that Chen Mingshu's reactionary words and deeds have developed in recent years to the point of frantically attacking the Party and the Party's leader. He fabricated facts, slandered Chairman Mao, and cursed the Communist Party. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are wholeheartedly loved by the people of the whole country. What conscience do you have to attack so arrogantly? What a despicable and shameless political careerist you are! You are a person who "loves what evil people love and hates what good people hate." I have seen through you, you shameless person. Now, you are standing on the edge of the enemy-us boundary. Thoroughly confessing your crimes is your only way out, otherwise, the 600 million people of the country will never agree.

Cai Tingkai said: Chen Mingshu is a reactionary element who harbors evil intentions.

A mad, ungrateful reactionary.

Cai Tingkai said: I accuse and rebuke with unparalleled anger the evil Chen Mingshu, who harbors evil intentions, is extremely reactionary, mad, and ungrateful, and opposes the Party and the people.

Cai Tingkai said: The Chinese Communist Party has led the Chinese people to liberation through decades of arduous struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice. Now it is leading the people of the whole country to work hard and happily to build our socialist motherland. Which battle, which construction undertaking, has not seen Communist Party members suffering first? Without the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, how could we have today, how could the great cause of socialist and communist construction be carried out? But you, Chen Mingshu, arbitrarily slander Chairman Mao, the great leader loved by the people of the whole country, and curse the Communist Party. This behavior is tantamount to challenging the people of the whole country. You are truly extremely arrogant.

Cai Tingkai said: The Communist Party is selfless, our leader is great, very modest, and always considers problems from the perspective of 600 million people and from the interests of the world proletariat. This is recognized by peace-loving people all over the world. But Chen Mingshu slanders the leader as being "biased in listening" and "fond of boasting and eager for success." Chen Mingshu, your slander is turning black and white and confusing right and wrong. You eat the people's food, but you speak there on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek and the reactionaries. We will never tolerate this.

Cai Tingkai said that the Communist Party is great, Chairman Mao is great, and our cause is unprecedented. We want to build socialism and always follow the Communist Party. We want to sing praises. Why shouldn't we sing praises? It is true that all of us who follow the Communist Party on the road to socialism have become "flatterers" in your eyes; Chen Mingshu! You are truly a shameless thing that flatters Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei! You also slander Chairman Mao, saying that "he is sometimes inevitably swayed by joy and happiness, and in the heat of the moment, readily hurts the self-esteem and inherent status of senior cadres." This is also unfounded and turns right and wrong. Take you as an example! Look at you, this "senior cadre"! You have consistently supported Chiang and opposed the Communist Party; even on the eve of liberation, you were still colluding with Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. After liberation, the people let you serve as a member of the Central People's Government and also let you take part of the work responsibility in Central and South China. What contributions have you made to the people that can withstand such generous treatment from the people? But you, unwilling to work hard to reform yourself, have consistently held a resistant and rebellious attitude towards the Party, and have even developed to the point of supporting the reactionary Liang Shuming at the enlarged meeting of the Central People's Government. Your reactionary words and deeds have made you lose the people's trust in you. When the National People's Congress nominated representatives in 1954, because Chairman Li of our party was recuperating, I was entrusted to negotiate with several responsible comrades from the Central Committee. According to the wishes of the masses, because your actions have lost your qualifications as a people's representative, it was decided not to nominate you. The leading party was still generous, and in order to take care of you, hoped that you would correct your mistakes, and still nominated you. You have made such a big mistake, and the party still patiently persuades the people to give you a chance to rehabilitate yourself. You should change your ways, thoroughly repent, and strive to make amends for your crimes in order to live up to the party's concern and care for you and the comrades' hopes for you. The facts of the past few years have conclusively proved that you are an ungrateful and shameless reactionary element.

Jiang Guangnai continued to expose Chen Mingshu's facts of opposing the Communist Party and supporting Chiang Kai-shek

Jiang Guangnai said in his speech that he can be a witness to Chen Mingshu's various ugly histories. He fully agreed with Comrade Mei Gongbin's sixteen-character evaluation of Chen Mingshu: "In name, he opposes Chiang, but in reality, he opposes the Communist Party; in name, he resists Japan, but in reality, he supports Chiang." Then Jiang Guangnai further revealed several facts about Chen Mingshu's support for Chiang and opposition to the Communist Party. Jiang Guangnai said, first, Chiang Kai-shek launched a large-scale attack on the "Soviet area" in Jiangxi. At that time, I led my troops stationed in Ganzhou. The soldiers were extremely angry at Chen Jitang's trampling on Guangdong. I wanted to use the contradiction between Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Jitang to fight back to Guangdong, but at this time Chen Mingshu returned from Japan, Chiang Kai-shek appointed him as the "Commander-in-Chief of the Left Wing Army for Suppressing Bandits," and he rushed to Ganzhou, prevented me from fighting back to Guangdong, and insisted on listening to Chiang Kai-shek's command to participate in the "suppression of the Communist Party." Isn't Chen Mingshu's support for Chiang and opposition to the Communist Party ironclad proof?

Second, when I was running the Fujian People's Government, I signed a military agreement with Guangdong and Guangxi, agreeing to jointly oppose Chiang Kai-shek. But when Chiang Kai-shek advanced into Fujian, Chen Mingshu did not consider how to resolutely resist Chiang Kai-shek's attack, but instead advocated attacking Chen Jitang in Guangdong. Chen Mingshu is a person who is often so faithless and fickle. At that time, his intention in attacking Guangdong was very obvious, that is, to "atone for his crimes" to Chiang Kai-shek, so as to return to Chiang Kai-shek's embrace. It's truly shameless in the extreme.

Third, as Comrade Wu Maosun mentioned last time, on the eve of the "January 28th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War, the military situation at the front was very urgent, but Chen Mingshu telegraphed me, asking me to go to Nanjing. I knew that Chiang Kai-shek was against the Anti-Japanese War, and there would be no good things to do in Nanjing, so I ignored it. Therefore, Chen Mingshu did not contribute to the Anti-Japanese War of the 19th Route Army, and the 19th Route Army was able to resolutely resist the Japanese invaders entirely because it received the encouragement and support of the people of the whole country. But Chen Mingshu has always written the Anti-Japanese War of the 19th Route Army on his own merit book, boasting everywhere.

Fourth, everyone knows that Chen Mingshu has nothing to do with the cultural and educational circles whether before or after liberation, but in recent years, he has suddenly become enthusiastic about culture and education, going everywhere to collect information, win people over, and connect people. After he returned from setting fire in Shanghai, I went to question him, you are not in the education field, why are you messing around in this area, he said: "Now politics is not very easy to do, I will do more work in culture and education in the future." Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji focused on setting fires in the cultural and educational circles. Luo Longji also said that he wanted to be the Minister of Higher Education in order to grab senior intellectuals, and Chen Mingshu was also setting fires in the cultural and educational circles, saying that he wanted to "do more work" in this area. Chen Mingshu, why are you so consistent with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji? You must thoroughly confess what relationship you have with the Zhang-Luo alliance?

Jiang Guangnai continued, saying that all the activities of right-wing careerists boil down to opposing the Communist Party, and Chen Mingshu went a step further, opposing the Party and first aiming his arrow at Chairman Mao, the most brilliant leader of the Party and the people of the whole country.

The people praise Chairman Mao as "the sun" and "the savior," but Chen Mingshu slandered our leader as not being aware of state affairs, not contacting workers and peasants, not knowing the people's hardships, and not caring about intellectuals. Chairman Mao is the leader of the proletarian revolution, but Chen Mingshu compared Chairman Mao with Bismarck, the originator of German militarism, and Ito Hirobumi, the originator of Japanese militarism. Isn't this the same tune as Dulles, McCarthy, Chiang Kai-shek and others who slandered our leader as a great dictator? But Chen Mingshu is still not satisfied with this, or is afraid that others cannot understand his meaning, and also concentratedly put forward Chairman Mao's "four major crimes," the so-called "fond of boasting and eager for success, moody, biased in listening, and despising the old." Chen Mingshu, even a three-year-old child can refute your distortions and slanders to the point of being completely defeated and raise their small fists to beat you to death.

Chen Mingshu secretly went to Shanghai to set fire.

He also asked others to "keep it a secret."

Chen Qiyuan said that in early June this year, when the rightists were frantically attacking the Party, Chen Mingshu secretly went to Shanghai, and also asked Comrade Zhang Su to keep it a secret for him, and not to publish his actions in Shanghai newspapers. Chen Qiyuan asked Chen Mingshu: "Why keep it a secret? What activities did you have in Shanghai? When the New Shanghai Middle School made trouble, what ideas did you give?" Chen Qiyuan also said that in the spring of 1927, when Chen Mingshu was the garrison commander of Wuhan and commander of the 11th Army, Chiang Kai-shek was engaged in separatist activities in Nanchang. At that time, Wuhan asked Chen Mingshu, Chen Gongbo and others to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and ask him not to make a split. But Chen Mingshu went and disappeared without a trace, and as a result surrendered to Chiang Kai-shek.

Gan Cisen revealed in his speech that Chen Mingshu boasted in Shanghai that his article published in the People's Daily, "Seeking Teachers and Friends from Non-Party Members," and an article by Zhang Naiqi were the most weighty, and Communist Party members were also studying these two articles. Chen Mingshu talked with more than 20 bad people who were dissatisfied with the Party, including Jing Kelin (a member expelled from the Revolutionary Committee), Yu Balin, etc. Chen Mingshu said to Zhou Yilin: "The Communist Party does not make a historical conclusion for you, the Revolutionary Committee will make a conclusion for you." He also said to Yu Balin: "It was the Communist Party who messed with you, not me, Chen Mingshu." Chen Mingshu once gave Yu Balin 600 yuan, Zhou Yilin 600 yuan, and the family of a Liu surnamed counter-revolutionary element 300 yuan from the dividends he received from the joint state-private enterprises. Chen Mingshu and Luo Haisha secretly discussed seizing the leadership of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, believing that Zhao Zukang was not good and so-and-so was good, and recommended them to the United Front Work Department in an attempt to control the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee organization.

Chen Mingshu must thoroughly confess the anti-Party conspiracy clique

Nie Hong said that in my last speech, I pointed out that from the revelations of comrades, it can be seen that Chen Mingshu has a conspiracy group with special agents, counter-revolutionaries with major crimes in history, and some dissatisfied elements such as Luo Haisha, Wang Cifu, and Luo Weizhi as the backbone. It is said that Chen Mingshu told Luo Weizhi about our meeting through his secretary Wang Zhinan that afternoon, and then I received two threatening letters from Luo Weizhi, asking me to declare that my speech was based on "misunderstanding," otherwise I would be held criminally responsible. I want to ask Chen Mingshu: Did you and Luo Weizhi and others enter into an alliance, instructing Luo Weizhi to threaten me so that I would not dare to further expose your conspiracy? Last winter, Chen Mingshu wrote a letter of 40,000 to 50,000 words to Comrade Li Xuefeng. This letter is a collection of poisonous weeds, making great slanders and libels against the Party and Party members. It was the origin of his later public proposal to abolish the school's party committee system. Luo Weizhi of the Petroleum Institute, Zheng Ke of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, and some other rightists who have been exposed, all collected a large number of materials for him and participated in the secret symposium he organized; Luo Weizhi and Zheng Ke also participated in the drafting of that letter. Now I know that Luo Weizhi also demanded the abolition of the party committee system at the Petroleum Institute and had close ties with an anti-Party clique at the Petroleum Institute. Zheng Ke frantically attacked the Party at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts and was the backbone of an anti-Party clique at the Academy of Arts and Crafts. In addition, Chen Mingshu also has an anti-Party clique in Shanghai centered on the special agent Luo Haisha. When he went to Shanghai, he also wanted Luo Haisha to carry out activities in Hong Kong. I want to ask Chen Mingshu: In which regions and schools do your conspiracy group have branches? Who is in charge? What is the relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance? How did you cooperate to attack the Party? You still have two copies of the letter you wrote to Comrade Li Xuefeng. You must hand them over quickly.

Zhu Yunshan revealed that Chen Mingshu has been recruiting henchmen everywhere in the past year and storing "ammunition" for attacking the Party.

Zhu Yunshan said in his speech that Chen Mingshu's anti-Party activities have intensified in the past year and have reached the edge of self-isolation from the people. Then, he revealed some new materials about Chen Mingshu's hatred and opposition to the Party. He said that all reactionary bourgeois rightists, in order to seize the leadership of the democratic parties, must first attack the progressive elements who are close to the Party and exclude cross-party members who help work in the democratic parties. Chen Mingshu is the same, and his methods are vicious. He ridiculed the articles written by progressive people as "written by secretaries" and "insincere"; some comrades who were originally close to him, because they recognized his face and drew a line with him, he said "no friends," meaning he blamed others for not being friendly enough. In fact, comrades who have known him the deepest and longest have long been unwilling to be friends with him. After the People's Daily editorial was published on June 8, he said that the anonymous letter received by Lu Yuwen was fabricated, saying that Lu Yuwen was a clown. Chen Mingshu even slandered the cross-party members who help work in the democratic parties as "only creating estrangement," and viciously cursed "the work of party members participating in democratic parties is not adopted by politicians with a little brains in the autocratic dynasty."

Zhu Yunshan said that the inspection work of the people's representatives is a serious and responsible work, but Chen Mingshu deliberately described it as "the government arranges in advance, and real materials cannot be obtained." Therefore, last winter, he came up with a "secret inspection." He specially selected people who were dissatisfied with the Party in various schools and invited them to his home for meetings batch after batch. The so-called "materials" he used to slander the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, slander the party leadership of the school, and slander the Communist Party were obtained in this way. It is no accident that he adopted this approach. On the one hand, his purpose was to use this to recruit henchmen, and on the other hand, he wanted to store ammunition for attacking the Party. Chen Mingshu should thoroughly explain these situations! I heard that he also wrote a letter of 10,000 words to attack the Party this spring. Chen Mingshu should hand this letter over to the Revolutionary Committee organization for review!

Zhu Yunshan said that after the start of helping the Party's rectification, Chen Mingshu's activities to attack the Party intensified. In mid-May, after he made several absurd remarks at the United Front Work Department's symposium, he hurriedly ran to Shanghai to encourage his henchmen Luo Haisha and others to make trouble at New Shanghai Middle School. According to the revelations of comrades such as Wu Yiwu and Zhang Bao, members of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, Chen Mingshu and other reactionary elements were carrying out organized and planned activities. Chen Mingshu should thoroughly confess the purpose and activities of his trip to Shanghai and the truth about the Chen-Luo anti-Party group. Zhou Fanwen said in his speech that once when he was eating at the Xidan Shopping Mall, Chen Mingshu said: "I think Stalin will become worthless in the future." Later, the People's Daily published two articles on "The Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," which made a fair evaluation of Stalin's merits and demerits, but Chen Mingshu was not interested and always regarded Stalin as a sinner for eternity. After the Hungarian incident, Chen Mingshu said: "The Hungarian incident broke out under the rule of Stalinists and was a spontaneous political movement of the people."

Zhang Zhizhong's speech criticized the reactionary words and deeds of Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, and Tan Tiwu; and talked about some of his feelings about the ideological transformation of people from the old society and the old regime.

Also speaking at today's meeting were Wu Xinda, He Guiyan, Hou Jingru, and Wang Baozhen.

    陈铭枢公然诬蔑毛主席
    民革中央小组一致痛斥陈铭枢狂妄无耻
    本报讯　14日上午，民革中央小组举行十四次扩大会议，再一次揭发并批判陈铭枢的反动言行。在会上发言的，有李济深、吴茂荪、蔡廷锴、蒋光鼐、陈其瑗、甘祠森、聂轰、朱蕴山、周范文、于振瀛、赵祖康、梅龚彬、朱学范、邵恒秋等。
    吴茂荪在会上集中地揭发了最近一个时期陈铭枢污蔑毛主席的一些反动言论，引起了参加会议的人的极大愤慨。吴茂荪说：根据揭露的材料，陈铭枢公然把全国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席同德国的俾斯麦、日本的伊藤博文相提并论。他把毛主席说成是“个人修养上的热而不淡，疾而不舒，燥而难宁，察而难周之失，也难免于影响到察人听言，决策定计的睿断，以及在政策措施上的畸轻畸重、失缓失急。”
    陈铭枢污蔑毛主席“好大喜功”，并要毛主席“更加深入体察，以求究竟”。他说毛主席有时“为喜怒所乘，在一个浪潮之下，轻于挫伤高级干部的自尊心和他们的固有地位”。他说毛主席“轻信干部的虚假汇报与教条主义的分析方法，未经郑重细致的研究，即作过激的决定”。他认为毛主席“过分鄙夷旧的”，“对古典文学尚有不尊重之处”，他的根据是毛主席在致臧克家的信中有“因为是旧体诗，怕谬种流传，遗误青年”一句话。
    陈铭枢还污蔑毛主席所接触的非党人士多是“趋附之辈”。他认为“来自旧中国的某些上层人士”“贪天之功者有之，不虞之誉者有之，争名猎位，禄蠹充斥”，认为他们是“以革命作幌子，包藏卑媚”。
    陈铭枢这样肆无忌惮地攻击和污蔑全国人民最敬爱的领袖毛主席，引起了大家的无比愤慨。许多人在发言中都严厉地斥责了他的这种荒谬言行。
    李济深说：陈铭枢是一个十分恶劣的政治野心家；他恶人之所好，好人之所恶
    李济深发言说：陈铭枢不论在解放前解放后，都毫无为人民为国家服务之心，他一切从个人出发，一心想作领袖，他是一个十分恶劣的政治野心家。陈铭枢无耻地认为解放前每次革命都是他领导的，窃取人民革命之功为己功，还印发小册子，为自己吹嘘。1951年华北革大毕业典礼，民革中常会派邵力子同志代表民革参加，陈铭枢却擅自去讲话，结果群众大为不满。陈满口马列主义，实际上是宣传他的不伦不类的佛学唯心论。陈铭枢在民革二届二中全会时，到处挑拨关系，请客拉人，打击别人，抬高自己，妄图利用同志捧他为民革领袖。他为了夺取民革的领导地位，抓住上海、南京、武汉三个地方组织，制造人事纠纷，认敌为我，培植私人势力，使三个地方组织造成很大损失。
    陈铭枢在武汉工作时，捏造事实，题诗污辱共产党，到处散发，说警卫员监视他。我要问陈铭枢：你有什么不可告人的事情？如果没有不可告人的事情，你为什么怀疑共产党派人监视你？我问你，你这样恶毒诽谤党，用心何在？
    李济深说，陈铭枢的反动言行近年来发展到向党和党的领袖猖狂进攻的地步。他捏造事实，诽谤毛主席，大骂共产党。毛主席和共产党是全国人民衷心爱戴的，你这样狂妄进攻，还有什么天良可言？你是多么卑鄙无耻的政治野心家！你是一个“恶人之所好，好人之所恶”的人，我对你这个无耻之徒已经看透了。现在，你已站在敌我界线的边沿上了，彻底交代罪行，才是你的生路，否则全国六亿人民是绝对不能答应的。
    蔡廷锴说：陈铭枢是一个包藏祸心
    丧心病狂、忘恩负义的反动分子
    蔡廷锴说：我以无比的愤怒心情控诉斥责包藏祸心、反动透顶、丧心病狂、忘恩负义、反党反人民的万恶的陈铭枢。
    蔡廷锴说：中国共产党几十年来艰苦奋斗流血牺牲领导着中国人民获得解放。现在正领导着全国人民辛勤地欢欣鼓舞地建设我们的社会主义的祖国。哪一个战役，哪一件建设事业不是共产党员吃苦在先。没有党和毛主席的英明的正确的领导我们怎么会有今日，社会主义共产主义建设的大业怎能够进行。而你陈铭枢却肆意诋毁全国人民热爱的伟大领袖毛主席，谩骂共产党。这种行为无异于向全国人民挑战，你真狂妄到极点了。
    蔡廷锴说：共产党是大公无私的，我们的领袖是伟大的，非常谦虚，考虑问题，永远是从六亿人口出发的，从全世界无产阶级利益出发的。这是全世界爱好和平的人们所公认的。而陈铭枢却诽谤领袖，“偏听偏信”，“好大喜功”。陈铭枢，你的诽谤是颠倒黑白，混淆是非。你吃人民的饭，却在那里替蒋介石和反动派说话，我们是决不能容忍的。
    蔡廷锴说，共产党是伟大的，毛主席是伟大的，我们的事业是前人所未有的。我们要建设社会主义，永远跟着共产党走。我们是要歌颂的。为什么不该歌颂呢？不错，我们这一切跟着共产党走社会主义道路的人们在你的眼里，竟变成“趋附之辈”；陈铭枢！你才真正是个趋附蒋介石汪精卫的无耻的东西！你还诽谤毛主席，竟说“有时尚不免为喜乐所乘，在一个浪潮之下，轻于挫伤高级干部的自尊心和他们的固有地位”。这也是毫无根据颠倒是非的，就拿你来说吧！就看你这个“高级干部”吧！你一贯地拥蒋反共；一直到解放前夕还是和蒋介石的特务勾搭着。解放之后人民让你任中央人民政府委员，还让你在中南负一部分工作责任。你对人民有甚么贡献能经得起人民这样的宽待？而你呢，不肯努力改造，却一贯对党抱着抵触反抗的情绪，竟发展到在中央人民政府扩大会议上为反动的梁漱溟撑腰。你的反动言行，已经使你失去了人民对你的信任。在1954年协商全国人民代表提名的时候，因本党李主席正在休养，我受委托和中央几个负责同志协商。根据群众的意愿，由于你的所作所为已经丧失了作为人民代表的资格，决定不提你的名。还是领导党宽大，为了照顾你，希望你改正错误，还是提了你的名。你犯了这样大的错误，党还要耐心说服人民给你自新的机会。你就应该革面洗心，痛改前非，争取立功赎罪，才不辜负党对你的关怀照顾和同志们对你的希望。几年来的事实，你的反共反人民的罪恶活动，确凿地证明了你是个忘恩负义，没有廉耻的反动分子。
    蒋光鼐继续揭露陈铭枢反共拥蒋的事实
    蒋光鼐在会上发言说，他可以作陈铭枢种种丑恶历史的见证人，他完全同意梅龚彬同志给陈铭枢下的十六个字的评语：“名为反蒋，实则反共，名为抗日，实则拥蒋。”接着蒋光鼐补充揭露了陈铭枢几件拥蒋反共的事实。蒋光鼐说，第一，蒋介石在江西大举进攻“苏区”，当时我率部驻在赣州，士兵对陈济棠蹂躏广东，极为愤慨，我想利用蒋介石与陈济棠的矛盾打回广东，可是这时陈铭枢从日本回来，蒋介石封他做“剿匪左翼军总司令”，他连忙赶到赣州，阻止我打回广东，坚持要听蒋介石的指挥参加“剿共”。陈铭枢的拥蒋反共，这难道不是一个铁证吗？
    第二，我在搞福建人民政府的时候，曾经同广东和广西订立了一个军事协议，相约联合反蒋。可是当蒋介石进兵福建的时候，陈铭枢却不考虑怎样坚决抵抗蒋介石的进攻，反而又主张去打广东的陈济棠。陈铭枢这个人就是经常这样的背信弃义，反复无常。当时他之所以要去打广东，用心是很明显的，就是想对蒋介石来一个“将功折罪”，好重新回到蒋介石的怀抱，真是无耻之尤。
    第三，吴茂荪同志上次已经谈到，在“一·二八”淞沪抗战前夕，前方的军情正十分紧急，陈铭枢却打电报给我，要我去南京。我知道蒋介石是反对抗日的，去南京没有好事，就置之不理。所以陈铭枢对于十九路军的抗日，并无寸功可言，而十九路军之能够对日本侵略者进行坚决的抵抗，也完全是由于得到了全国人民的鼓励和支持。可是陈铭枢却一直把十九路军的抗日写在自己的功劳簿上，到处招摇撞骗。
    第四，大家都知道陈铭枢无论在解放前和解放后同文化教育界都是风马牛不相及的，可是近年来，他忽然对文化教育热衷起来，到处去搜集情况，拉拢人，联络人。他从上海点火回来，我曾去质问他，你不是教育界，为什么要在这方面乱搞，他说：“现在政治不太好搞，我今后要在文化教育方面多做些工作。”章伯钧、罗隆基著重在文化教育界放火。罗隆基还说他想当高教部部长，为抓高级知识分子，而陈铭枢也在文化教育界点火，说要在这方面“多做工作”。陈铭枢，你为什么会同章伯钧、罗隆基这么一致呢？你必须彻底坦白交代，你和章、罗联盟究竟有些什么关系？
    蒋光鼐接着说，右派野心家一切活动都归结于反对共产党，陈铭枢更进一步，他反对党而首先把箭头对准了党和全国人民最英明的领袖毛主席。
    人民歌颂毛主席“是太阳”，“是救星”，陈铭枢竟诬蔑我们的领袖不察国家大事，不联系工农群众，不知民间疾苦，不关心知识分子。毛主席是无产阶级革命的领袖，而陈铭枢却把毛主席同德意志军国主义的鼻祖俾斯麦，和日本军国主义的鼻祖伊藤博文来相提并论，这和杜勒斯、麦卡锡、蒋介石之流，诬蔑我们的领袖是大独裁者，岂不正是同一声调吗？可是陈铭枢还不以此为满足，或者还怕别人不能明白他的意思，还集中地提出了毛主席的“四大罪状”，所谓“好大喜功，喜怒无常，偏听偏信，鄙夷旧的。”陈铭枢，你这种歪曲和污蔑连三岁小孩子也能把你驳得体无完肤，也要举起他们的小拳头来活活把你打死。
    陈铭枢偷偷到上海点火
    又要别人“保守秘密”
    陈其瑗说，今年六月初，正当右派分子向党猖狂进攻的时候，陈铭枢竟然秘密到上海，还要张苏同志为他保守秘密，不要上海的报纸登载他的行动。陈其瑗问陈铭枢：“为什么要守秘密？你在上海有那些活动？新沪中学闹事，你出了些什么主意？”陈其瑗还说，1927年春天，陈铭枢任武汉卫戍司令兼第十一军军长的时候，蒋介石在南昌搞分裂活动。当时武汉方面曾要陈铭枢、陈公博等去见蒋介石，要他不要闹分裂。可是陈铭枢一去杳如黄鹤，结果投降了蒋介石。
    甘祠森在发言中揭发，陈铭枢到上海自吹，他在人民日报发表的文章“向非党人士求师访友”和章乃器的一篇文章，最有分量，共产党员也在学习这两篇文章。陈铭枢找过二十多个对党不满的坏人谈过话，其中有景克林（民革开除的党员）、余巴林等。陈铭枢对周一林说：“共产党不给你作历史结论，民革给你作结论。”又对余巴林说：“是共产党搞你的，不是我陈铭枢搞的。”陈铭枢曾把在公私合营企业所得到的股息，送给余巴林六百元，送给周一林六百元，送给刘姓反革命分子家属三百元。陈铭枢和罗海沙秘密商量夺取上海民革领导权，认为赵祖康不好，某某等好，向统战部推荐，企图控制上海民革组织。
    陈铭枢必须彻底交代反党阴谋小集团
    聂轰说，我在上次发言中，曾经指出从同志们的揭发，可以看出陈铭枢有一个从历史上有重大罪行的特务、反革命分子和一些不满分子如罗海沙、王次甫、罗伟之之流为骨干的阴谋集团，据说当天下午陈铭枢就通过他的秘书王之南把我们开会的情况告诉了罗伟之，跟着我就接到了罗伟之两封带恐吓性的信，要求我声明我的发言是出于“误会”，否则就要负刑事责任。我要问陈铭枢：你是不是同罗伟之等人订立了攻守同盟，指使罗伟之来威胁我，使我不敢进一步来揭发你的阴谋？去年冬天，陈铭枢写过一封四、五万字的信给李雪峰同志，这封信集毒草之大成，对党和党员大肆污蔑和诽谤，是他后来公开提出撤消学校党委制的张本。石油学院的罗伟之、中央工艺美术学院的郑可，还有一些其他已被揭发的右派分子，都为他搜集了大批的材料，参加过他组织的秘密座谈；罗伟之和郑可还参加了那封信的起草。现在知道罗伟之在石油学院也要求取消党委制，同石油学院的一个反党小集团有密切的联系。郑可在中央工艺美术学院猖狂向党进攻，是工艺美术学院一个反党小集团的骨干分子。此外，陈铭枢在上海还有一个以特务罗海沙为中心的反党小集团，他去上海还要罗海沙去香港活动。我要问陈铭枢：你的阴谋集团在哪些地区和哪些学校有分支机构？负责的是什么人？跟章罗联盟有什么关系？你们怎样配合向党进攻？你写给李雪峰同志的信还保留两份，你要赶快交出来。
    朱蕴山揭露陈铭枢近一年来到处收罗党羽，储备向党进攻的“弹药”
    朱蕴山在发言中，首先说明陈铭枢这一年来变本加厉地进行反党活动，已经到了自绝于人民的边沿。接着，他揭发了陈铭枢仇视党、反对党的一些新材料。他说，一切反动的资产阶级右派分子，为了攫取民主党派的领导权，首先就要打击靠拢党的进步分子，排斥在民主党派帮助工作的交叉党员。陈铭枢也是这样，而他的手段是恶毒的。他讥笑进步人士所写的文章是“出于秘书之手”，“言不由衷”；有的本来和他接近的同志，因为认清了他的面目，和他划清了界限，他就说“没有朋友了”，意思是怪别人不够朋友。其实知道他最深最久的同志，早已不愿和他做朋友了。6月8日人民日报社论发表后，他说卢郁文接到的匿名信是捏造的，说卢郁文是小丑。对于在民主党派帮助工作的交叉党员，陈铭枢竟污蔑他们“只会造成隔阂”，并恶毒地咒骂“党员参加民主党派的工作，为专制王朝稍有头脑的政治家所不取。”
    朱蕴山说，人民代表的视察工作，本是一项严肃认真的工作，但陈铭枢却别有用心地说成是“政府事先布置好了，得不到真实材料。”因此，去年冬天，他别出心裁，搞了一个“秘密视察”。在各学校专门挑选对党不满分子，一批又一批的约到他家去开会。他诬蔑肃反运动，诬蔑学校党的领导，诬蔑共产党的一些所谓“材料”，都是采用这种方式得到的。他采取这种方式，不是偶然的。他的目的，一方面是要借此收罗党羽，一方面是要储备向党进攻的弹药。陈铭枢应该将这些情况彻底交代！听说他在今年春天还写了一封向党进攻的万言书，陈铭枢应把这个万言书交到民革组织上来审查！
    朱蕴山说，帮助党整风开始后，陈铭枢向党进攻的活动加紧了。5月中旬，他在统战部座谈会上发表了几次荒谬言论之后，就匆匆跑到上海去，鼓动他的党羽罗海沙等在新沪中学闹事。根据上海民革成员吴艺五、张胞等同志的揭发，陈铭枢和罗海沙等反动分子，是在进行有组织有计划的活动。陈铭枢应把他去上海的目的和活动情况，以及陈罗反党集团的真象，彻底交代。周范文发言说，有一次在西单商场吃饭时，陈铭枢说：“我看，斯大林将来要变成一文不值。”以后，人民日报发表了两篇“论无产阶级专政的历史经验”，对斯大林的功过作了公正的评价，但是陈铭枢不感兴趣，一直把斯大林看成千古的罪人。在匈牙利事件发生后，陈铭枢却说：“匈牙利事件是在斯大林主义者统治下而爆发的，是人民自发的政治运动。”
    张治中的发言，对龙云、黄绍竑、陈铭枢和谭惕吾的反动言行进行了批驳；并对从旧社会旧政权来的人进行思想改造问题，谈了他的一些感想。
    在今天会上发言的还有、吴信达、贺贵严、侯镜如、王葆真等人。
