Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th – A recent article in "Pravda" pointed out that the Soviet Union's grain sown area has now leaped to the first place in the world.

The article said that in 1956, the Soviet Union's grain sown area reached 128.3 million hectares, greatly exceeding the level of the United States (71.3 million hectares), one of the world's major grain-producing countries, and exceeding the total grain sown area of Canada, Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany by 85.1 million hectares. This year, the Soviet Union's grain sown area increased by another 1.5 million hectares compared to last year.

In terms of unit area yield and quality of cotton, the most important industrial raw material crop, the Soviet Union now also ranks first in the world. Last year, the Soviet Union harvested an average of 21.6 quintals (each quintal equals 200 catties) of cotton per hectare, while the average cotton yield per hectare in capitalist countries was only 7.5 quintals, of which the United States had only 13.5 quintals.

TASS reports that Uzbekistan, the Soviet Union's most important cotton-producing region, now ranks third in the world in terms of total cotton production, second only to the United States and China. Last year, it harvested more than 2.85 million tons of cotton, more than four times the amount during the Tsarist era. In terms of cotton yield per unit area, it has surpassed Egypt, Turkey, and Iran. Tajikistan ranks second in the Soviet Union in terms of total cotton production, but its cotton yield per unit area last year exceeded all other regions of the Soviet Union and was higher than any other country in the world.

The Soviet Union also leads the world in sugar beet production. In terms of unit area yield, the Kyrgyz Republic of the Soviet Union caught up with the United States last year and greatly exceeded the levels of France, Italy, Britain, and Denmark.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th – Some Soviet republics where industry was very backward before the October Revolution have now caught up with many industrialized capitalist countries in terms of industrial output per capita.

The industrial production level of the Kyrgyz Republic in Central Asia has now greatly exceeded some capitalist countries in Europe and Asia. Its coal and oil production per capita is higher than that of Italy and Japan, and its sugar production has exceeded countries such as France, Italy, and West Germany. At present, this national republic has established approximately 500 large-scale modern industrial enterprises, whose output every ten days is now much greater than the total annual industrial output of Kyrgyzstan in 1913 before the revolution.

Uzbekistan was one of the "most backward frontiers" of Tsarist Russia. At that time, someone wanted to open a textile factory in this cotton-producing region, but the governor-general sent here by the Tsar refused on the grounds that it "conflicted with the interests of factory owners in Moscow and Ivanovo in Russia." Under Soviet power, the per capita production of cotton fabrics in this national republic has now exceeded that of Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and other countries. Thirty years ago, the first hydroelectric power station in the republic's history was built here, but its electricity production level has now greatly exceeded many countries. If calculated per capita, each Uzbek now consumes the equivalent of 100 times the electricity consumed by an Iranian, or twice the electricity consumed by an Italian or Spaniard.

In the years since the establishment of Soviet power, more than 1,000 large industrial enterprises have been built in the Georgian Republic, and the total industrial output is almost 29 times greater than in 1931. Now, its pig iron production per capita is several times higher than that of industrialized Italy and Japan, its steel production is greater than the total steel production of Switzerland, Norway, and Turkey combined, and its manganese ore production exceeds the total production of South Africa, Ghana, French Morocco, Congo, Japan, and the United States.

    社会主义制度下的生产力突飞猛进
    苏联谷物播种面积跃居世界首位
    不少共和国工业产量按人口比例超过许多资本主义国家
    新华社莫斯科30日电　“真理报”最近的一篇文章指出，苏联的谷物播种面积现在已经跃居世界第一位。
    文章说，1956年苏联的谷物播种面积达一亿二千八百三十万公顷，大大超过世界主要产谷物国家之一美国的水平（七千一百三十万公顷），比加拿大、英国、法国、意大利和西德的谷物播种面积的总和还多八千五百一十万公顷。而在今年，苏联的谷物播种面积又比去年增加一百五十万公顷。
    就最重要的工业原料作物棉花的单位面积产量和质量来说，苏联现在也占世界第一位。苏联去年平均要从每公顷土地上收获二十一点六公担（每公担合二百市斤）棉花，而资本主义国家每公顷土地的棉花产量平均只有七点五公担，其中，美国只有十三点五公担。
    塔斯社的消息说，苏联最主要的产棉区乌兹别克共和国在棉花总产量方面现在仅次于美国和中国，居世界第三位。去年这里收获了二百八十五万吨以上的棉花，比沙皇时代增加了四倍多。就棉花单位面积产量来看，它已经超过了埃及、土耳其和伊朗。塔吉克共和国的棉花总产量居苏联第二位，然而它的棉花单位面积产量去年却超过苏联其他地区，并且比世界上任何国家都高。
    苏联的甜菜生产也占世界第一位。就单位面积产量来说，苏联的吉尔吉斯共和国在去年已经赶上了美国，并且大大超过了法国、意大利、英国和丹麦的水平。
    新华社莫斯科30日电　苏联一些在十月革命以前工业非常落后的加盟共和国，现在在按人口平均计算工业产量方面已经赶上了许多工业发达的资本主义国家。
    中亚细亚的吉尔吉斯共和国的工业生产水平现在已经大大超过了欧洲和亚洲的一些资本主义国家。按人口平均计算，它的煤和石油产量要比意大利和日本多，糖产量已经超过了法国、意大利和西德这样一些国家。目前，这个民族共和国已经建立了约五百个现代化大工业企业，它们现在每十天的产量还比革命前1913年吉尔吉斯工业全年的总产量多得多。
    乌兹别克是沙皇时代俄国“最落后的边疆”之一。当时，有人曾经想在这个盛产棉花的地区开办一家纺织工厂，可是被沙皇派驻在这里的总督以“因与俄国之莫斯科及伊凡诺沃的工厂厂主利益相冲突”的理由拒绝了。在苏维埃政权下，现在这个民族共和国按人口平均计算的棉织品产量，已经超过了英国、法国、意大利、日本等国。三十年前，这里才开始建成了共和国有史以来的头一个水电站，可是它的电力生产水平现在已经大大超过了许多国家，如果按人口平均，每个乌兹别克人现在所能消费的电力已经等于伊朗的一百倍，等于意大利或者西班牙的两倍。
    格鲁吉亚共和国在苏维埃政权建立后的年代中建成了一千多个大工业企业，工业总产量几乎比1931年多二十九倍。现在，它出产的生铁按人口平均计算等于工业发达的意大利和日本的好几倍，钢产量比瑞士、挪威和土耳其几国钢产量的总和还多，锰矿砂产量超过南非联邦、加纳、法属摩洛哥、刚果、日本和美国等国产量的总和。
