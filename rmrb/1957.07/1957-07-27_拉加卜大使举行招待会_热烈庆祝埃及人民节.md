Xinhua News Agency, July 26th—Egyptian Ambassador to China, Ragheb, held a reception this afternoon to celebrate Egypt's "People's Day."

　　Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception, and on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended warm congratulations to the Egyptian government and people. He said that the Chinese people sincerely congratulate the Egyptian people on achieving greater success and more victories in the cause of safeguarding national independence and building their motherland.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai said that in the past five years, especially since last year, the Egyptian people, under the leadership of President Nasser, have traversed a difficult but victorious road. The Egyptian people have consolidated their unity and developed their economy and culture. The Egyptian people have resolutely opposed colonialism, adhered to a foreign policy of peace and neutrality, and stood stronger by defeating various imperialist intimidations, threats, and even armed aggression. At present, the Egyptian people still face many difficulties, especially as U.S. imperialism is insidiously replacing the position of British and French imperialism in actively invading the Middle East, and is meanly engaging in activities to undermine the unity of Arab countries and isolate Egypt. However, we believe that the seasoned Egyptian people will surely unite with the people of Arab countries, overcome all kinds of difficulties, defeat the conspiracies of imperialism, and open up a broader path towards prosperity and strength for themselves. The Egyptian people are by no means isolated. The Egyptian people can believe that the Chinese people and all peace-loving countries and people in the world will, as in the past, resolutely support your just struggle. Premier Zhou Enlai finally proposed a toast to the heroic Egyptian people, to the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people, to the friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries and world peace, and to the health of His Excellency President Nasser!

　　Ambassador Ragheb spoke at the beginning of the reception. He said that the revolution of the armed forces that began on July 23, 1952, under the wise leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser, ended the then corrupt regime. On July 26 of the same year, the last king of the dynastic rule was forced to leave the country, and a brand new page in Egyptian history was unfolded.

　　After narrating the achievements Egypt has made in internal reform and economic construction in recent years, Ambassador Ragheb said that the nationalization of the Suez Canal and the return of this area to Egypt can be said to be a great achievement of the Egyptian revolution. The canal's transit fees will help improve the canal's navigation and consolidate Egypt's national economy.

　　Ambassador Ragheb said that the aims of Egypt’s revolution in foreign policy are:
　　1. To pursue an independent policy of active neutrality. Egypt does not believe that military alliances are the way to maintain world peace.
　　2. Strengthening Egypt’s relations with Asian and African countries and abiding by the resolutions of the Bandung Conference are the results of pursuing the above-mentioned policy, as is recognizing the People's Republic of China.
　　3. To further strengthen Egypt’s relations with other Arab countries. The liberation of many Arab countries deeply oppressed by colonialism proves that this policy has its merits and will inevitably lead to the unity and prosperity of the entire Arab world.

　　Ambassador Ragheb said that the revolution has been very cautious in establishing a national democratic order, and the convening of the National Assembly on July 23 this year marks the completion of this task. He said, however, that these achievements were obtained in the face of strong opposition from imperialism and its accomplices. Egypt has had to face the struggle against attempts to drag it into military alliances, the struggle against Israeli threats, the struggle to defend Egypt's rights as an international entity and to play an independent role in international affairs! The struggle against the economic pressure imposed on Egypt after the nationalization of the Suez Canal, the struggle to resist armed aggression, and the struggle against undermining the unity of Arab countries and attempts to isolate Egypt in the Arab world. He said that Egypt has achieved victory in all these struggles, all thanks to the political talent of Nasser, supported by all the Egyptian people and peace-loving countries around the world.

　　Ambassador Ragheb added that Egypt and China are closely united together against imperialism, no matter what disguises it uses to cover up its ugly plans; striving to improve the people's living standards and maintain peace. The struggles of Egypt and China have won the support of peace-loving people all over the world.

　　Ambassador Ragheb finally proposed a toast to the achievements of the Chinese revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, to the achievements of the Egyptian revolution under the leadership of President Nasser, and to world unity and world peace!

　　Also attending the reception were Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen and Chen Shutong, Vice-Premier He Long, Deputy Foreign Minister Zhang Wentian, people from all walks of life in China, as well as diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China.

    拉加卜大使举行招待会
    热烈庆祝埃及人民节
    据新华社26日讯　埃及驻中国大使拉加卜今天下午举行招待会，庆祝埃及的“人民节”。
    周恩来总理出席了招待会，他代表中国政府和人民向埃及政府和人民致以热烈的祝贺。他说，中国人民衷心地祝贺埃及人民在维护民族独立和建设祖国的事业中取得更大的成就和更多的胜利。
    周恩来总理说，最近五年来，特别是去年以来，埃及人民在纳赛尔总统的领导下，走过了一段艰辛而胜利的道路。埃及人民巩固了自己的团结并且发展了自己的经济和文化。埃及人民坚决反对殖民主义，坚持和平中立的外交政策，并且击败了帝国主义的各种恐吓、威胁、以至武装侵略而更加坚强地站立起来了。目前摆在埃及人民面前还有不少的困难，特别是美帝国主义正在阴险地代替英法帝国主义的地位积极侵略中东，并且卑鄙地进行破坏阿拉伯国家团结和孤立埃及的活动。但是，我们相信，经过锻炼的埃及人民，一定能够团结阿拉伯各国人民，战胜各种困难，击败帝国主义的阴谋，而给自己开辟一条更加宽阔的走向繁荣富强的道路。埃及人民决不是孤立的。埃及人民可以相信，中国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，都会像过去一样，坚决支持你们的正义斗争。周恩来总理最后提议为英勇的埃及人民，为中埃两国人民的友谊，为亚非国家友好合作和世界和平，为纳赛尔总统阁下的健康干杯！
    拉加卜大使在招待会开始时讲话。他说，1952年7月23日，在加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔英明领导下开始的武装部队的革命，结束了当时腐败的政权。同年7月26日，王朝统治的最后一个国王被迫离开了国土，埃及的历史就展开了崭新的一页。
    拉加卜大使在叙述了埃及几年来在内政改革和经济建设等方面所取得的成就以后说，苏伊士运河的收归国有，和这一地区的归还埃及，可以说是埃及革命的壮举。运河的通行税将有助于改善运河的航行和巩固埃及的国民经济。
    拉加卜大使说，埃及在对外政策方面革命的目的是：
    1、奉行积极中立的独立政策。埃及不相信军事同盟是保持世界和平的方法。
    2、加强埃及与亚非国家的关系，遵守万隆会议的决议，承认中华人民共和国，就是奉行上述政策的结果。
    3、进一步加强埃及与其他阿拉伯国家的关系，许多深受殖民主义压迫的阿拉伯国家的解放，证明这个政策是有它的功绩的，并将必然导致整个阿拉伯世界的团结与繁荣。
    拉加卜大使说，革命一直非常谨慎的在建立一个全国的民主秩序，今年7月23日国民议会的召开标志着这个任务的完成。他说，但是，这些成就是在帝国主义与其同谋者的极力反对之下获得的。埃及不得不面对着反对企图把它拖入军事同盟的斗争，反对以色列威胁的斗争，维护埃及作为国际实体的权利和在国际事务担任独立角色的斗争！反对在苏伊士运河国有化之后加于埃及的经济压力的斗争，抵抗武装侵略的斗争，反对破坏阿拉伯国家的团结和企图使埃及在阿拉伯世界中孤立的斗争。他说，埃及在所有这些斗争中，都取得了胜利，这一切都归功于全体埃及人民和全世界爱好和平的国家所支持的纳赛尔的政治才干。
    拉加卜大使又说，埃中两国正紧密地团结在一起，反对帝国主义，不管它用什么样的伪装来遮盖它的丑恶计划；努力提高人民的生活水平和维护和平。埃中两国的斗争获得了全世界爱好和平人民的支持。
    拉加卜大使最后提议为在毛泽东主席领导下的中国革命获得的成就，为在纳赛尔总统领导下的埃及革命所获得的成就，为世界团结与世界和平干杯！
    出席招待会的，还有副委员长李济深、陈叔通，副总理贺龙，外交部副部长张闻天和中国各方面的人士以及各国驻华使节和外交官员。
