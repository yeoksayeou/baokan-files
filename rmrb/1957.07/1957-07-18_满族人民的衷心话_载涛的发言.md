Manchurian People's Heartfelt Words
Zai Tao's Speech

I fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the various work reports of the leading comrades.

After studying and discussing the Premier's report, I have gained tremendous insights and improvements in my thinking. Without the correct leadership of the great Communist Party, our motherland would not have stood up and achieved its current international status. Without the Five Great Movements and the Three Great Transformations, it would have been impossible to victoriously enter socialism. Our China has leaped from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial weak position to socialism. This is the blessing of our 600 million people, the great fruit of the Communist Party's leadership, and a historical miracle!

Judging from the production increase figures cited in the report, it can be proven that the speed and breadth of our country's production development are advancing by leaps and bounds. Needless to say, the production situation in previous dynasties before liberation cannot be compared with today's situation at all. Even looking at the achievements of the past few years since liberation, they have been increasing year by year and changing with each passing day.

As for the lives of the broad masses of the people, whether in politics, culture, or material aspects, they have been significantly improved with the development of production. During my inspection, I saw that whether they were Han people or people of minority nationalities, under the leadership, care, and education of the Communist Party, their production has been improving day by day, and their lives have therefore been improving day by day. Taking the situation of our Manchurian people as an example, compared to the tragic experience of being oppressed and discriminated against during the reactionary rule, left to fend for ourselves, there is a world of difference. Now, under the leadership of the Party, our Manchurian people are joyfully working together with all fraternal nationalities, learning advanced skills, improving their lives, and making significant progress in clothing, food, housing, transportation, politics, and culture. When the Manchurian people in various places met me, they expressed their gratitude to the Party and the government for their care. They expressed their heartfelt support for the Party's great and correct policies.

Obvious facts and brilliant achievements are placed before us, but the right-wing elements unscrupulously distort and even slander them. Did they really not see them? No, they have other intentions. They want to pull the progressive society back to capitalist society so that the bourgeoisie can be restored. I now solemnly warn the right-wing elements that your dreams are in vain. I represent our Manchurian people in warning you that we have full confidence in crushing your reactionary thoughts and absurd words and deeds. Socialism will not allow the slightest wavering. We will definitely do our best to defend this great cause and the fruits of our liberation.

Now, the Manchurian people in various places are enthusiastically demanding to study Marxism-Leninism in their political life. For example, in Chengdu, they have already organized study groups with the local Mongolians. In terms of cultural education, a Manchurian primary school has been established in Guangzhou. Manchurians have also participated in various visiting groups in various places. Everyone has seen the leaping construction achievements, which has greatly increased their confidence and enhanced their enthusiasm for progress. I would like to represent all our Manchurian people in expressing our heartfelt words: from now on, we will always unite and advance under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the government, and strive to build a more glorious and splendid socialist society!

### 满族人民的衷心话  载涛的发言

    满族人民的衷心话
    载涛的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和各位领导同志的各项工作报告。
    我学习了讨论了总理的报告后，在思想认识上得到极大的收获和提高。若没有伟大的共产党的正确领导，我们祖国不会站起来得到今天的国际地位，若没有五大运动、三大改造，是不可能这样胜利的走入社会主义。我们中国从一个半封建半殖民地的弱小地位，一跃而进入了社会主义，这是我们六亿人民的如天之福，这是共产党领导的伟大果实，是历史上的奇迹！
    从报告中所举出的增产数字来看，可以证明我国生产发展速度广度的突飞猛进。这不用说在解放前历代的生产情况根本不能和今天相比，即从解放以来几年的成绩来看，也是逐年增加，日新月异。
    至于广大人民的生活，无论在政治上、文化上、物质上，都随着生产的发达，得到显著的提高。我在视察中看到，无论汉族人民或少数民族人民，他们在共产党的领导关怀和教育下，生产日有提高，因之生活日有改进。即以我们满族人民的情况来说，比起过去在反动统治时期的被压迫、歧视，任其自生自灭的悲惨遭遇，真是有天渊之别。现在我们满族人民在党的领导下欢欣鼓舞的和各兄弟民族共同劳动，学习先进技能，提高生活，衣、食、住、行和政治、文化，都有显著的增进。各地满族人民在见到我的时候，都表现了感激党和政府对他们的关怀。对于党的伟大、正确的政策，都表现出衷心的拥护。
    明显的事实、辉煌的成绩摆在我们的面前，而右派分子却毫无良心的加以歪曲以至诬蔑。他们果然是没有看见吗？不是，他们是另有居心，是想把进步的社会拉回到资本主义社会，以便资产阶级得到复辟。我现在郑重地警告右派分子，你们的梦想是枉费心机，我代表我们满族人民警告你们，你们的反动思想，荒谬言行，我们有十足的把握使之粉碎。社会主义是坚决不容许丝毫动摇的。我们一定全力保卫这项伟大事业，保卫我们翻身的果实。
    现在我们各地的满族人民在政治生活上，就热烈的要求学习马列主义，像成都已经和当地蒙民一同组织起学习会。在文化教育上，广州成立了满族小学；各地历次的参观团，也都有满民参加，大家看到飞跃的建设成绩，更增加了绝大的信心，更提高了要求进步的热情。我谨代表我们全体满民，说出衷心的话：今后永远在共产党和政府的正确领导下团结前进，为建设更光辉、更灿烂的社会主义社会而奋斗！
