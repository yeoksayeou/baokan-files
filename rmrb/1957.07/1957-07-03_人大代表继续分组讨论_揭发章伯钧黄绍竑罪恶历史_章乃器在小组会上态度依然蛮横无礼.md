Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued group discussions this morning.

The bourgeois rightists Zhang Bojun, Huang Shaohong, and others continued to be criticized by the delegates. At the group meetings of delegates from Guangxi and Anhui provinces, delegates exposed Huang Shaohong's anti-Party and anti-people criminal history and Zhang Bojun's consistent two-faced tactics in politics. Huang Rong, a delegate from Guangxi Province who had fought against Huang Shaohong on the battlefield for more than 20 years, was most familiar with Huang Shaohong's anti-Party and anti-people criminal history. Today, he said at the group meeting that Huang Shaohong grew up in a despotic landlord family and was known for his brutality in Guangxi. In April 1927, Huang Shaohong went to Nanjing to participate in the "Party Purification" meeting convened by Chiang Kai-shek. On the morning of the day Chiang Kai-shek launched the "April 12th" coup, Huang Shaohong arrested and killed ninety Communist Party members in Nanning. From April to September of that year, Huang Shaohong arrested tens of thousands of people in various parts of Guangxi, including Communist Party members, revolutionary cadres, and progressive masses, and brutally slaughtered them.

Huang Rong said that after the Nanchang Uprising of the Red Army in 1927, Huang Shaohong first sent one of his divisions to attack the troops of Generals He Long and Ye Ting. Later, Huang Shaohong himself led two divisions to attack the troops of He Long and Ye Ting. Huang Rong also angrily pointed out that in 1941, Huang Shaohong colluded with Gu Zhutong in the Southern Anhui Incident.

Huang Rong pointed out that Huang Shaohong was a reactionary element with countless blood debts and firm anti-communist and anti-people views in the past. After liberation, the people forgave him and gave him the opportunity to serve the people, but he continued to oppose the Party and the people. He said that it is not too late for Huang Shaohong to turn back today. As long as he makes a profound self-criticism and honestly confesses, the people will still give him a way out.

Wei Zhangping, Vice President of Guangxi Nationalities Institute, said that everyone knows that there were many bandits in Guangxi before liberation, which was a major threat to the people's lives. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the elimination of hidden traitors after liberation, Guangxi saw an unprecedented stable social order where people did not pick up lost items and doors were not locked at night. However, Huang Shaohong was unwilling to see these things. When he inspected Guangxi, he specifically looked for faults, saying that this struggle was wrong and that the punishment for that counter-revolutionary was too severe. He turned a blind eye and deaf ear to the great achievements Guangxi Province has made in recent years. Why is this?

Faced with these facts, Huang Shaohong had to admit that his mistakes "were extremely serious" and that his remarks spread like poison in society, for which he felt "very uneasy." Huang Shaohong admitted that his thinking was reactionary and that his behavior "was going in the opposite direction, going further and further, becoming more and more reactionary." The delegates believed that his self-criticism was still empty and lacked the determination to thoroughly confess and reform.

At the group meeting of delegates from Anhui Province, Zhou Xinmin, a Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, exposed Zhang Bojun's consistent practice of playing two-faced tactics in politics. Zhou Xinmin said that Zhang Bojun pretended to be progressive after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and was very close to the Chinese Communist Party delegation in Chongqing at that time; but secretly, his relationship with the Youth Party was very close. In November 1946, the Youth Party and Zhang Bojun, in the name of the third force, wrote a letter to Chiang Kai-shek, saying that if negotiations with the Communist Party could not reach an agreement, they hoped that Chiang Kai-shek would convene a pseudo-National Assembly. The Youth Party representatives and Zhang Bojun expressed in the letter that they would participate in the pseudo-National Assembly. On the morning of the day they wrote the letter to Chiang Kai-shek, the representatives of the third force met with Zhou Enlai, the then representative of the Chinese Communist Party, but they did not mention to Zhou Enlai that they had written the letter to Chiang Kai-shek. Zhou Xinmin said that Zhang Bojun used this two-faced tactic to deceive the Chinese Communist Party and colluded with the Youth Party to carry out the conspiracy to undermine the resolutions of the Old Political Consultative Conference.

Zhou Xinmin said that on May 1, 1948, the Chinese Communist Party issued the call to "all democratic parties, people's organizations, and social figures to promptly convene a political consultative conference to discuss and realize the convocation of a people's congress and the establishment of a democratic coalition government." At that time, representatives of various democratic parties in Hong Kong unanimously supported the CCP's "May 1st" call. Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun also sent a telegram to Yan'an, expressing their support. However, Zhang Bojun's support was fake. He secretly cursed the Communist Party and attempted to turn China into a "three-way division of the world": the Communist Party in the Yellow River basin, Chiang Kai-shek in the Yangtze River basin, and the third force in the South China region. At that time, Zhang Bojun also wanted to win over Li Zongren and others to retreat to South China and jointly establish and develop a third force in South China. At the same time, he secretly organized the so-called "Democratic Action Committee," formulated a program, and secretly united Liang Shuming, Zhang Dongsun, Luo Longji, and others to coordinate his activities in Hong Kong, in order to undermine the CCP's "May 1st" call.

Zhou Xinmin also said that Zhang Bojun consistently hated Communist Party members in the Democratic League. Before liberation, he said to Zhu Yunshan, a Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, that the Democratic League should not have secret Communist Party members within the League. In 1947, the newspaper run by the Ministry of National Defense of the Kuomintang government published three articles introducing the history and activities of three Communist Party members in the Democratic League. According to later investigations, most of these materials were provided by Zhang Bojun. Some delegates also pointed out that Zhang Bojun secretly attacked some Communist Party members within the League. Usually, he often wildly guessed who was a Communist Party member and who was not.

In the past few days, Zhang Naiqi has shown an extremely bad attitude that is intolerable in the Sichuan Provincial delegation group meeting. He put on the airs of the bourgeoisie, was arrogant, refused to self-criticize, and said that "no anti-Party or anti-socialist thoughts can be detected even after three years of self-examination." He even openly scolded those who exposed him. Zhang Naiqi's bad attitude aroused great indignation among the delegates, who believed that this was a blatant contempt for the people's representatives entrusted by the people, and demanded that he thoroughly examine and confess. Many delegates also talked about the important practical significance of the policy of "eliminating all counter-revolutionaries."

    人大代表继续分组讨论
    揭发章伯钧黄绍竑罪恶历史
    章乃器在小组会上态度依然蛮横无礼
    据新华社2日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天上午分组讨论。
    资产阶级右派分子章伯钧、黄绍竑等继续受到代表们的批判。在广西、安徽两省的代表小组会上，代表们揭露了黄绍竑反党反人民的罪恶历史和章伯钧在政治上一贯的两面手法。曾经同黄绍竑在战场上斗争过二十多年的广西省代表黄荣，最熟悉黄绍竑的反党反人民的罪恶历史，今天他在小组会上说，黄绍竑在一个恶霸地主家庭长大，在广西他以残暴闻名。1927年4月黄绍竑到南京参加了蒋介石召开的清党会议，在蒋介石发动“四·一二”政变的当天早晨，黄绍竑在南宁逮捕了九十名共产党员加以杀害。从这一年的4月到9月，黄绍竑在广西各地逮捕了成千上万的人，其中包括共产党员、革命干部和进步群众，惨酷地加以屠杀。
    黄荣说，1927年红军南昌起义后，黄绍竑起先派出他的一个师去攻打贺龙和叶挺将军的部队，后来黄绍竑又自己率领两个师兵力去攻打贺龙和叶挺部队。黄荣还愤怒地指出，在1941年，黄绍竑曾同顾祝同合谋过皖南事变。
    黄荣指出，黄绍竑过去是一个血债累累、坚决反共反人民的反动分子，解放以后人民宽恕了他，给了他为人民服务的机会，但他却继续反党反人民。他说，黄绍竑今天回头还不晚，只要深刻检讨，老实交代，人民还是会给他一条出路的。
    广西民族学院副院长韦章平说，大家知道，解放以前广西的土匪是很多的，这对人民生活是一个重大的威胁。解放后经过镇反和肃反运动后，广西出现了路不拾遗、夜不闭户的空前安定的社会秩序。可是黄绍竑不愿意看到这些，他在广西视察时专找岔子，说这个斗错了，那个反革命分子处分重了。他对几年来广西省取得的伟大成绩一概闭眼不看，充耳不闻，这是为了什么？
    黄绍竑面对这些事实，不得不承认他的错误“是十分严重的”，他的言论像毒素一般散布在社会上，对此，他感到“十分不安”。黄绍竑承认他的思想是反动的，他的行为“是在向反对的方向走，越走越远，越走越反动”。代表们认为他的检讨仍然空洞，仍然缺乏彻底交代革心洗面的决心。
    在安徽省代表小组会上，民主同盟中央常务委员周新民揭发章伯钧在政治上一贯耍弄两面派的手法。周新民说，章伯钧在抗日战争胜利后伪装进步，和当时在重庆的中国共产党代表团很接近；但暗中和青年党的关系却很密切。1946年11月间，青年党和章伯钧等以第三势力方面的名义写信给蒋介石，说假如与中共和谈不能达成协议，即希望蒋介石召开伪国大。青年党代表和章伯钧在信中表示要参加伪国大。在他们写信给蒋介石的当天上午，第三势力方面的代表见到了当时中共代表周恩来，但他们没有向周恩来谈到他们写信给蒋介石的事情。周新民说，章伯钧就是以这种两面手法欺骗中国共产党，和青年党一起进行破坏旧政协决议的阴谋活动。
    周新民说，1948年5月1日中国共产党发出了“各民主党派、各人民团体及社会贤达，迅速召开政治协商会议，讨论并实现召集人民代表大会，成立民主联合政府”的号召。当时在香港的各民主党派代表一致拥护中共“五一”号召。沈钧儒和章伯钧并拍发电报到延安，表示拥护。可是章伯钧是假拥护，他暗中骂共产党，并企图把当时的中国变成“天下三分”的局面：共产党在黄河流域，蒋介石在长江流域，第三势力方面在华南一带。章伯钧当时还想拉拢李宗仁等退到华南，共同在华南建立和发展第三势力。同时他还秘密组织了所谓“民主行动委员会”，制定了纲领，暗中联合梁漱溟、张东荪、罗隆基等配合他在香港的活动，以此来破坏中共“五一”号召。
    周新民还说，章伯钧一贯仇视在民主同盟内的共产党员。解放前他就对民革中央常务委员朱蕴山说，民主同盟不要秘密的共产党员在民盟内部。1947年，国民党政府国防部办的报纸曾发表三篇文章，介绍了三个在民盟内的共产党员的历史和活动。据以后调查，这些材料大部分是章伯钧供给的。还有代表指出章伯钧对盟内一些共产党员暗中进行打击，平时他常胡乱猜疑谁是共产党员，谁不是共产党员。
    章乃器这几天在四川省代表小组会上，表现了令人不能容忍的极端恶劣的态度，他摆出资产阶级的臭架子，态度横蛮，拒绝检讨，说“再检查三年也检查不出反党反社会主义思想”。甚至公然谩骂揭发他的人。章乃器的这种恶劣态度，激起代表们极大的愤慨，代表们认为这是章乃器对于受人民委托的人民代表的公然藐视，要他彻底检查交代。许多代表发言中还谈到“有反必肃”的方针的重要现实意义。
