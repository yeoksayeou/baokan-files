    “Little Devil Squad”
    Major Wang Zhengfu
    In 1940, when our 27th Regiment was operating north of the Daqing River in Central Hebei, there was a group of poor children who fed pigs and herded cattle for landlords. They often surrounded us and asked, "What brand is your gun? How many bullets does it hold?" "When are you leaving?"
    One day, the troops were about to depart. This group of children arrived very early. One tugged at your clothes, murmuring, "Uncle, I want to go with you!" Another grabbed your hand, sucking on it, "Uncle, I want to be a Eighth Route Army soldier!" They made such a fuss that you couldn't handle them even with eight mouths.
    Seeing that they were not as tall as rifles, I said, "Want to be an Eighth Route Army soldier? Good, then first see if you are as tall as this gun." Unexpectedly, this made them chatter even more. "I am as tall as the gun!" "I'm only a little bit shorter!" One "little devil" was even more straightforward: "Regardless of whether I am as tall as the gun, I want to be an Eighth Route Army soldier to fight the Japanese devils!"
    And so, no matter what we said, they just wouldn't go back. Later, the regimental leaders helplessly said, "These little fellows..." and decided to keep them, assigning them as messengers in the regimental and battalion headquarters.
    A few days later, the little fellows, seeing that they hadn't gotten a gun yet, puffed up their cheeks and grumbled all day about going down to the company. "I've already become an Eighth Route Army soldier, but I haven't even touched a gun." "If they don't give us one, we'll snatch it from the devils." From then on, whenever there was a battle with the Japanese, they would try to sneak to the front lines, always hoping to find an opportunity to get a gun to use.
    These "little devils" were only allowed to be organized into a squad and assigned to the Fourth Company as soldiers in the second year after joining the Youth Team (similar to the Youth League) by the regimental leaders.
    In that year, the Japanese devils launched the "May First" Great Sweep. The people of Central Hebei were entirely involved in the intense anti-sweep struggle. At dawn on June 16th, as we were covering the transfer of the Party and government leading organs of Central Hebei to Zhangshi Village in Nangong, the enemy followed closely behind.
    The terrain of Zhangshi Village was very unfavorable to us. Not far from the village was an enemy stronghold, and 500 meters north of the village was a bunker. The area around the village was also a flat plain. Only in the northwest corner of the village were there a few dilapidated houses and trees.
    The regimental commander placed our Second Battalion on the west and north sides of the village. The battalion decided that Platoon Leader Li Cai would lead the "Little Devil Squad" to defend these few protruding dilapidated houses and monitor the enemy's movements.
    As soon as the troops were deployed, the enemy began shelling us with a thunderous roar. Soon, gunfire erupted everywhere, and the entire line was engaged with the enemy.
    The area defended by the "Little Devil Squad" was the main target of the Japanese attack. The enemy attempted to seize this place as a forward position. Under the command of the platoon leader, the little devils used the remaining walls and rubble as cover, and in coordination with the firepower of their friendly neighbors on the left and right sides, formed a tight fire net, repelling several enemy assaults.
    The battle became more and more intense, and we were surrounded on all sides. The battalion commander ordered me to go to the "Little Devil Squad's" position to see how they were doing, encourage them to hold out until dark, and strengthen the fire support to their left and right flanks.
    I quickly emerged from a gap in the broken wall and rolled vigorously down the depression towards the northwest. I rolled all the way to the back of a large fallen tree. I looked at my body and saw that my clothes had been pierced by more than a dozen holes. A piece of skin had been shot off my right arm. I slightly raised my head and looked around. There was not a single person in sight, only broken bricks, tiles, smoke, and dust filling the area. I was immediately shocked: "Could it be...?" I crawled forward a few more steps and found two little devils covered in gray mud behind the tree stump. They were hiding in a pit under the tree trunk, still holding grenades in their hands, silently watching the enemy. I hurriedly crawled over to them. Just as I was about to speak, I heard a "bang!" A shot fired by the Japanese devils hit one of the little devils in the ear. He trembled slightly, touched his bloody ear with his right hand, and said, "Special Commissioner, look! The devils are afraid that I won't grow up, so they pierced an ear hole for me." Then he cursed fiercely, "These sons of bitches! Only coming, never going. Um, look at that area!" I looked in the direction he was pointing and saw a large area of enemy corpses lying scattered in front of the position.
    I bandaged his ear, gave them a few more instructions, and crawled to the back of the wall to find Comrade Li Cai. He told me, "These little fellows are very strong. When they run out of bullets, they pounce on the enemy corpses like little tigers to find more." He wiped the ash from his mouth and continued, "Now four comrades have been wounded, three lightly and one seriously. We have repeatedly tried to persuade them to go down, but they say that they would rather die than leave the front line at this time..." He paused slightly and said in a pleading tone, "Special Commissioner, it's good that you've come! You go and persuade them..." He didn't finish speaking when he sneezed. Immediately, I also smelled a pungent odor. The Japanese devils had released poison gas. "Quick! Quick! Chew up the garlic you brought, cover your mouths and noses with handkerchiefs, and prepare to counterattack the devil's charge immediately!"
    The little devils hadn't had a drop of water for a whole day and night. Their lips were cracked with dryness, and their clever eyes were constantly tearing up from the irritation of the poison gas. Soon, the Japanese devils crawled up. The little fellows gritted their teeth one by one, constantly wiping their eyes with handkerchiefs and cursing, "You have poison gas, but we have grenades! Come on! Let's see who gets who!"
    Seeing that the Japanese devils were crawling very close, a shout of "Fire!" went up! Rifles and grenades all came together, directly hitting the devils, who dropped a pile of corpses and scurried back with their tails between their legs.
    I went to see the seriously wounded little devil again. He was lying in a pile of bricks and tiles, and fresh blood was still seeping through the bandages. I gently hugged him and said, "Little devil, come down with me!" He pushed my hand away and said, "Go down? Hmph! I will never go down until the devils are completely wiped out!" I wanted to force him to carry him away, but unexpectedly, he was like a nail hammered into the ground, holding tightly to his rifle without moving.
    They held out until 10:30 in the evening before successfully breaking through with the troops.

    “小鬼班”
    少校　王正夫
    1940年，我们二十七团在冀中大清河北边活动时，有一群给地主喂猪、放牛的苦孩子，时常围着我们问道：“你这个枪是啥牌子？能打几个子儿呀？”“你们啥时候走呀？”
    一天，部队要出发了。这群孩子，老早的就跑来了。这个拉着你的衣服咕哝着：“叔叔，我要跟你们走！”那个拽着你的手?吮着：“叔叔，我要当八路！”闹的你长八张嘴也应付不过他们来。
    我看他们都没步枪高，就说：“要当八路？那好，你们自己先看看有没有这支枪高？”没曾想，这下更惹的他们七嘴八舌的嚷开了。“我有枪高！”“我就差那么一点点呀！”有个“小鬼”来的更干脆：“不管有没有枪高，反正我要当八路去打日本鬼子！”
    就这样，不管怎么说，就是不回去，后来团首长无可奈何的说了声：“这群小家伙呀……。”就把他们留下来，安置在团、营部当小通讯员了。
    几天后，小家伙们，看看自己还没有落着枪，一个个把嘴鼓的老高，整天咕哝着要下连去；“我都成了八路了，连个枪毛还没摸着呢。”“不给，咱从鬼子手里去夺。”从此，一和鬼子打上仗，他们就抽空往最前沿钻，老想能抓个机会落上一支枪使使。
    这几个“小鬼”，在加入青年队（类似青年团的组织）的第二年，团首长才肯放手把他们组织成一个班，编到四连当战士去。
    就在这年，日本鬼子开始了“五一”大扫荡。冀中人民整个卷入了火热的反扫荡斗争中。6月16日拂晓，我们掩护着冀中的党政领导机关，刚转移到南宫掌史村，敌人就尾随着追上来了。
    掌史村的地形，对我们很不利，村子不远的地方，就是敌人的据点，村北五百公尺处，就有一个堡垒。村子周围，又是一马平川的开阔地。只有村子西北角孤零零地有几间破烂房子和几棵树。
    团长把我们二营摆在村西和北面，营里决定李才排长带领“小鬼班”坚守这几间突出的破房子，监视敌人动静。
    部队刚布置开来，敌人就轰隆隆地向我们开了炮。不一会，枪炮声四起，全线都和敌人接上火了。
    “小鬼班”坚守的这块地方，是鬼子攻击的主要目标。敌人企图强占这里作为先头阵地。小鬼们在排长的指挥下，利用残墙断壁做掩体，以手榴弹、步枪和左右两侧的友邻火力配合起来，组成一道严密的火网，打退了鬼子的几次冲击。
    战斗越来越激烈了，我们四面受敌包围。营长命令我到“小鬼班”的阵地上去看看，鼓励他们坚持到天黑，并加强左右两侧的火力支援他们。
    我迅速从断墙缺口处钻出来，一股劲的顺洼地朝西北方向滚去。一气就滚到一棵炸倒了的大树后面。我看了看身上，衣服上被打穿了十来个窟窿。右臂上打掉了一块肉皮。我稍稍抬起头来往四周一望，一个人影也没有，尽是些残砖碎瓦，硝烟和灰尘弥漫着这个地方。我心里顿时一震：“难道……？”我又向前爬了几步，在树楂子那边发现了两个满脸灰泥的小鬼，他们正隐蔽在树干下面凹坑里，手里还握着手榴弹，一动不动的监视着敌人。我赶忙爬过去，刚要和他们说话，只听“叭”的一声，鬼子打来一枪，正打在一个小鬼的耳朵上。他微微震动了一下，用右手摸着血淋淋的耳朵说：“特派员，你看！鬼子还怕老子不成人呢，给我扎了个耳朵眼。”接着又狠狠的骂起来：“这些狗日的！只有来的没有去的。嗯，看那一片！”我顺着他手指的方向看去，阵地前面横七竖八的躺着一大片敌人的尸体。
    我给他把耳朵包扎上，又嘱咐了他俩几句话，就爬到墙根后面找到了李才同志。他跟我说：“这群小家伙可坚强哩，子弹打光了，就像小老虎似的扑到敌尸堆里去摸。”他擦了擦嘴上的灰泥接着又说：“现在有四个同志负伤了，三个轻的，一个重的。再三劝他们都不下去，却说，就是死也不在这时候下火线……。”他稍停了一下，像央求似的说：“特派员，你来的正好！你去动员……。”他没说完就打起嚏喷，顿时我也感到一股刺鼻的气味，鬼子放毒气了。“快！快！把带的大蒜嚼碎，用手帕捂住口鼻，立刻准备还击鬼子的冲锋！”
    小鬼们一昼夜没有喝一口水了，嘴唇干的裂了缝，他们那机灵的眼睛，被毒气刺激的不住地流泪水。不一会，鬼子爬着冲上来了。小家伙们一个个都咬着牙，不断用手帕擦着眼睛骂道：“你们有毒气，老子有手榴弹，来吧！看谁整住谁！”
    眼看着鬼子爬得很近了。一声“打”！步枪、手榴弹，一齐上来了，直打得鬼子扔下一片死尸，夹着尾巴又滚回去了。
    我又去看那个负重伤的小鬼。他躺在一个砖瓦堆子里，鲜血还在不住的透过绷带流出来。我轻轻抱住他说：“小鬼，跟我下去吧！”他推开我的手说：“下去？哼！不把鬼子消灭完，我决不下去！”我想强把他背走，不料，他就像钉子楔在那里一样，一动也不动的紧抓着他那只步枪。
    他们一直坚持到晚上十点半钟，才和部队一起胜利突围。
