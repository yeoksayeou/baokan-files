Xinhua News Agency, New York: An article published in the June issue of the American magazine "New Republic" stated that people currently living in American big cities are living a "nightmarish life."

    The article said that whether in New York, Chicago, or Philadelphia, people's "social status is determined by their work status, which is often determined by the ability to climb up the ladder. Espionage, flattering superiors and bullying subordinates, and conspiracies have become means of daily life. The most basic daily services are characterized by their indifference, such as bus drivers ignoring you on rainy days, and doctors and hospitals treating you as rows of moving corpses."

    People living in American big cities also "live in a state of constant feeling that disaster is about to strike." Violent deaths occur so frequently that people have become "indifferent" to them. Taking New York as an example, "A woman was hit and killed by a truck while crossing Herald Square, her head shattered; a plane crashed into the top of the Empire State Building; someone was pushed off the crowded subway platform and fell onto the tracks; flower pots and wooden fences falling from buildings hit an elderly black man or killed a driver; countless cases of beatings to death occur every day; these things are no longer surprising, so the newspapers never publish them." In addition, atomic war exercises create "citywide paranoia."

### 美国大城市里的人过着梦魇般的生活

    美国大城市里的人过着梦魇般的生活
    新华社讯　纽约消息：6月份一期的美国“新共和”杂志刊载一篇文章说，目前住在美国大城市里的人所过的是“梦魇般的生活”。
    这篇文章说，不论在纽约、芝加哥或者费城，人们的“社会的地位是由工作地位决定的，而工作地位又往往由向上爬的本领所决定。刺探内情、媚上欺下、阴谋诡计已经成为日常生活的手段。最基本的日常服务以它的冷漠著称，例如下雨天公共汽车司机不理会你，医生和医院把你当作排成队的会行动的死尸”。
    住在美国大城市里的人还“生活在一种经常感觉灾难即将到来的状态之中”。暴死事件是这样经常发生，以至人们对这些事情已经变得“漫不经心”了。以纽约为例，“一个女人在横穿先驱报广场的时候被卡车撞死，脑袋粉碎；飞机撞在帝国大厦大楼顶上；有人在拥挤的地下铁路的月台上被挤跌在铁轨上，从大楼大厦上面掉下来的花盆和木栅栏打中一个老年黑人或打死一个司机；每天数不尽的殴打致死的事件；这类事情已经毫不稀奇，以至报上也从不登载”。此外，还有原子战争演习，更造成“横扫全城的草木皆兵的恐惧”。
