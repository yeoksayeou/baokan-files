    Worries of Fishermen on the Shores of Liangzi Lake
    Qu Zhonghuai
    Liangzi Lake is the third largest lake in Hubei Province, bordering the three counties of Echeng, Wuchang, and Daye, with a water surface area of more than 653,000 mu, and is one of the main fish producing areas in Hubei Province. The annual fish production of the entire lake is about 13 million jin, and tens of thousands of fishermen depend on it for their livelihoods.
    In recent years, the fish production of Liangzi Lake has dropped sharply. Last year's output was only more than 6 million jin, a decrease of 50% compared with 1953; in the past, many lotus plants were grown in the lake forks, but now a considerable part of the water surface is barren.
    Why is this happening? Originally, the fish source of Liangzi Lake came from two sources: fish fry entering from the Yangtze River and reproduction by parent fish in the lake. In recent years, the Yangtze River irrigation outlets have been blocked, and fish fry from the river cannot enter the lake; and the parent fish and young fish in the lake have been severely damaged. The main spawning areas have been surrounded by local agricultural cooperatives to catch fish. The Gongyou Township's three agricultural cooperatives in Echeng County alone have enclosed more than 8,000 mu of lake, and plan to catch 30,000 jin of parent fish this year. We know that one parent fish lays 300,000 to 400,000 eggs, and based on a 10% survival rate, one parent fish can reproduce 30,000 to 40,000 fish.
    This practice of draining the pond to catch all the fish has not yet attracted the attention of the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Department, and some agricultural cooperatives even believe that this practice is "small investment and big profit." But the vast majority of fishermen are worried about this situation. They said, "Once there are no fish in the water, we will have to drink plain water."

    梁子湖畔渔民的忧虑
    屈仲槐
    梁子湖是湖北省第三大湖，横套鄂城、武昌、大冶三县，水面六十五万三千多亩，为湖北省主要鱼产地之一。全湖鱼的年产量在一千三百万斤左右，数万渔民依此为生。
    近年来，梁子湖鱼产量急剧下降，去年的产量只有六百多万斤，比1953年减少50％；过去湖叉多植莲，但现在相当部分的水面荒芜了。
    为什么会如此？原来梁子湖的鱼源有二：从长江灌入鱼苗和靠本湖亲鱼繁殖。近年来长江灌口被堵死，江里鱼苗不能入湖；而本湖的亲鱼和幼鱼，又遭到了严重的破坏。主要产卵区被当地农业社围湖捉鱼。仅鄂城县公有乡三个农业社就围湖八千多亩，今年计划捕亲鱼三万斤。我们知道一条亲鱼产卵三十至四十万，以10％成活率计算，一条亲鱼可以繁殖三至四万尾鱼。
    这种竭泽而渔的做法，至今没有引起湖北省水产部门的注意，有些农业社还认为这种作法“投资小，收益大”。但绝大多数渔民对这种情况表示忧虑，他们说：“一旦水中无鱼，我们就要喝白水了。”
