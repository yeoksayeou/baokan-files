The Production Potential of Third-Category Cooperatives Cannot Be Ignored
    Wuxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Rectifies Third-Category Cooperatives with Good Results

    Hangzhou Dispatch from our Newspaper: Our reporter Liu Fan reports: After forty days of rectification, the eighty-five third-category cooperatives in Wuxing County, Zhejiang, have been transformed from being disorganized to consolidated, which will play a significant role in striving for a bumper harvest in the county this year.

    These third-category cooperatives account for 23% of the county's agricultural cooperatives. For example, last year the average yield of rice in the third-category cooperatives was only 440 jin, which was 20% lower than the average yield of other cooperatives in the county (550 jin). This year, the county's rice production increase target has been raised from last year's 556 jin per mu to 700 jin. In order to ensure the realization of the production increase target, tapping the potential of third-category cooperatives has become an urgent task.

    Starting in April, the Wuxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized more than 170 cadres to go deep into the third-category cooperatives to assist cooperative cadres in solving problems and leading production. Now the work situation has undergone a fundamental change: the labor attendance rate has risen from 20% in the past to more than 90%; the area of accumulated fertilizer fields has increased from 403 mu to more than 16,200 mu; and the area of changed cropping systems has also increased significantly. After discussions by members of the eighty-five third-category cooperatives, a rice production increase target for this year was set at 610 jin. Now these cooperatives are working hard to achieve this production increase target.

    不能忽视三类社的增产潜力
    中共吴兴县委整顿三类社已收良好效果
    本报杭州电　本报记者刘凡报道：浙江吴兴县的八十五个三类社，经过四十天整顿，已经由涣散变为巩固，对争取今年全县大丰收将起显著作用。
    这个县的三类社占全县农业社的23％。如去年三类社水稻的平均产量只达四百四十斤，比全县其他社的平均产量（五百五十斤）低20％。今年全县水稻增产指标已从去年亩产五百五十六斤提到七百斤。为了保证增产指标实现，挖掘三类社的潜力，已经是刻不容缓的任务了。
    从4月间开始，中共吴兴县委组织一百七十多名干部深入三类社，协助社干部解决问题，领导生产，现在工作情况已经有了根本性的转变：劳动出勤率从过去的20％上升到90％以上；积肥的田由四百零三亩增至一万六千二百多亩；改变耕作制度的面积也有显著增加。经过八十五个三类社社员的讨论，订出了今年水稻增产指标——六百一十斤。现在这些社正在为实现这个增产指标而努力。
