    Jiangsu Jiangpu Agricultural Cooperative Cadres Strike Back Against Rightist Echoers
    Not Allowing Landlords to Usurp Leadership of Agricultural Cooperatives
    (Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, July 28th) The Jiangpu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened an enlarged meeting of agricultural cooperative branch secretaries and above. Over two hundred agricultural cooperative cadres angrily exposed and criticized the words and deeds of a small number of landlords, rich peasants, and other bad elements in the countryside who took the opportunity to spread rumors, confuse and incite the masses, and carry out sabotage activities.

    In the previous period, illegal landlords and rich peasant elements in the rural areas of Jiangpu County echoed the rightist elements, openly provoking by saying, "The unified purchase and sale of grain is good, but four hundred and eighty catties of grain is not enough to eat." A landlord from the "May Fourth" Agricultural Cooperative in Daqiao Township even conspired to usurp the leadership of the cooperative, campaigning among the members to elect him as the cooperative's director. Zhang Jiyao, a landlord from the Tuanjie Cooperative in Longshan Township, even arrogantly calculated accounts for the members, saying, "Before liberation, you only paid me fifty dan of rent. Now you pay public grain and sell surplus grain, and the government takes away more than one hundred dan. Is it better to have landlords, or is it better to have the Communist Party?" A threatening anonymous letter was also posted on the door of the director of the Liying Cooperative in Lingshan Township by bad elements.

    At the meeting, the cooperative cadres started by talking about the changes in their own and their villagers' lives before and after liberation, refuting the vicious remarks attacking the Party. Chen Yijin, a cadre from the Seven-Alliance Cooperative, said, "In our Youhu team, out of forty-six households, seventeen were in debt every year. At the end of the year, more than a dozen households had no rice to celebrate the New Year, and several people even froze to death one year. After liberation, every family has enough to eat and wear. Last year, in the cooperative's dividend distribution, everyone received enough rations." The cooperative cadres in Baima Township discussed the major flood in 1931, when farmers had money but could not buy grain. More than ten people starved to death in Baima Temple alone. However, during the major flood in 1954, when some areas breached the dikes and had no harvest, the state transferred rice from Sichuan and supplied it to farmers at normal prices, and transferred wheat seeds from other places to support production in the disaster areas. Aren't these all benefits of the unified purchase and sale system?

    After the cooperative cadres raised their understanding, they believed that it was necessary to encourage everyone to speak up more, to carry out propaganda and education work for the farmers at any time, and to expose and struggle against individual landlords and rich peasants who seriously violated the law.

### 江苏江浦农业社干部反击右派应声虫  不让地主篡夺农业社领导权

    江苏江浦农业社干部反击右派应声虫
    不让地主篡夺农业社领导权
    本报南京28日电　中共江浦县委最近召开农业社支部书记以上干部扩大会，二百多农业社社干部愤怒地揭发和批驳了农村中少数地主、富农及其他坏分子乘机造谣，迷惑和煽动群众，进行破坏活动的言行。
    前一时期，江浦县农村中的不法地主和富农分子和右派分子相呼应，公开挑拨说：“粮食统购统销好，就是四百八十斤粮吃不饱”。大桥乡“五四”农业社的地主甚至阴谋篡夺社的领导权，在社员中活动选他当社长。龙山乡团结社地主张继尧还狂妄的向社员算账，说“解放前你们只交五十担租给我，现在你们交公粮、卖余粮，要给政府搞去一百多担，还是地主好，还是共产党好？”灵山乡李营社社主任的大门上，也被坏分子贴上了匿名的恐吓信。
    会上，社干部从本村、本人解放前后生活变化谈起，驳斥了对党进行攻击的恶毒言论。七联社社干部陈倚金说：“我们油胡队四十六户人家，解放前有十七户年年背债，一到年底总有十几户无米过年，有一年还冻死了几个人。解放后家家有吃有穿，去年在社里分红，每人都分到了足够的口粮。”白马乡的社干部在讨论中谈到1931年大水灾，农民有钱买不到粮，单白马寺就饿死十多人，可是1954年大水时，有的地区破圩，颗粒无收，国家从四川调来大米，依平时价格供应给农民，从外地调来麦种支持灾区生产，这不都是统购统销的好处吗？
    社干部们在提高了认识后，认为要提倡大家多动嘴巴，随时向农民做宣传教育工作，并对个别严重违法的地主、富农进行揭露和斗争。
