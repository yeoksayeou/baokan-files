Guangdong Province Must Seize the Summer Planting Work
    Wu Erxiang

    Currently, there is a noteworthy situation in Guangdong Province's agricultural production: the summer planting work is progressing slowly. The planting of late rice is generally later than last year, and technical reforms are often not completed as planned. For example, in the Hainan area, the original requirement for late rice seed selection was to reach 90% this year, but only 58% was actually completed; the requirement for seed disinfection was to reach 60%, but only 21% was completed. The late rice planting and seed disinfection work in the Gaoyao Special Zone is not as good as last year. In some areas, the management of late rice seedling fields is lacking dedicated personnel, and seedlings are left to be beaten by rain, washed away by water, and trampled by people and livestock. Some agricultural cooperatives, due to unreasonable work points, have affected the enthusiasm of the members, resulting in poor drainage and irrigation in the seedling fields, and failure to fertilize or untimely fertilization, causing the seedlings to turn yellow, wither, and even rot. In ten townships of Hua County, more than 3,000 mu of seedling fields have been affected by pests.

    The greatest threat to late rice production is the shortage of fertilizer. At present, the province has accumulated over 300 million dan of native and miscellaneous fertilizers, a decrease of about 50% compared to the same period last year, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated in various regions is also uneven. In counties such as Lufeng, Zengcheng, and Boluo, the average is only 300 jin per mu, and in some cases, it is less than 100 jin per mu.

    There are many reasons why the summer planting work is not going well this year. For example, there was excessive rainfall in the first half of the year, and a lot of labor was spent on flood prevention and disaster relief; the spread of influenza in rural areas also affected the attendance of cooperative members. At the same time, farmers believe that there is an intercalary August this year, so they can take their time, which has led to some relaxation. However, the main reason is that the specific leadership of production was relaxed during the previous period. Some regions conducted democratic rectification of cooperatives in isolation, neglecting current production; some, due to the lack of timely and correct handling of the problems exposed in the democratic rectification, caused many opinions among the cooperative members, resulting in cadres being hesitant and afraid to lead, and even having negative and regressive thoughts. Some village cadres were afraid of reorganization, worried about returning home to production, and thus relaxed their leadership over current production.

    Doing a good job in summer planting and striving for a bumper harvest of late rice is of great significance to Guangdong Province's grain production increase this year. Judging from the current summer harvest situation, although the province suffered a rare flood disaster in the first half of the year, it is estimated that there will still be a slight increase compared to last year, which is gratifying. However, this year's spring harvest crops have decreased in production. To complete the province's plan to increase grain production by 2 billion jin, we have to rely on the second half of the year, and the key to increasing production lies in strengthening leadership. There are still about twenty days before the busy summer planting season. As long as we can properly and rationally use labor and overcome difficulties, it is still possible to complete the production increase plan.

    At present, provincial-level agencies have transferred more than 5,000 cadres to rural areas to assist farmers in summer harvesting and summer planting, and party and government departments at the special district and county levels will also send a large number of cadres down. These are all favorable conditions for doing a good job in summer planting.

### 广东省要抓紧夏种工作

    广东省要抓紧夏种工作
    吴尔祥
    目前，广东省农业生产中有一个值得注意的情况，就是夏种工作进展缓慢。晚稻播种一般都比去年迟些，技术改革也多不能完成计划。像海南区今年晚稻选种工作原要求达到90％，实际只完成58％；种子消毒要求达到60％，只完成21％。高要专区晚稻播种和种子消毒工作不如去年好。部分地区晚稻秧田管理工作，因为缺乏专人管理，秧苗任凭雨打、水冲、人畜践踏；有的农业社因为工分不合理，影响了社员的积极性，以致秧田排灌不好，不施肥或施肥不及时，致使秧苗发黄、枯萎，甚至腐烂。化县十个乡，受虫害的秧田就有三千多亩。
    对晚稻生产威胁最大的是肥料不足。目前全省积土杂肥约三亿多担，比去年同期减少了50％左右，而且各地区积肥的数量也不平衡。陆丰、增城、博罗等县平均每亩地只有三百斤，少的每亩还不到一百斤。
    今年夏种工作不好，原因是多方面的。比如上半年雨水过多，防洪抗灾花了不少劳动力；农村流行性感冒蔓延，社员出勤也受到影响。同时农民认为今年有一个闰8月，可以慢慢来，因而产生了某些松懈情绪。但是主要的原因，是由于前一段放松了生产的具体领导。有些地区孤立地进行民主整社，忽视了当前的生产；有的由于在民主整社中，对暴露出来的问题缺乏及时、正确处理，社员意见很多，造成了干部缩手缩脚，不敢领导，甚至有消极退坡的思想。一些乡村干部害怕整编，耽心回家生产，由此放松了对当前生产的领导。
    做好夏种工作，争取晚稻丰收，对广东省今年粮食增产是有着重大的意义。从目前夏收的情况来看，上半年虽然遭受了几十年少见的洪水灾害，估计比去年仍能稍有增产，这是可喜的。但是今年春收作物减产，要完成全省增产粮食二十亿斤的计划，不得不指望下半年了，而增产的关键则在于加强领导。现在离夏种大忙还有二十来天，只要能够好好地合理使用劳动力，战胜困难，完成增产的计划仍然是可能的。
    目前省级机关已抽调五千多名干部下乡协助农民夏收夏种，专县各级党政部门也将抽出大批干部下去，这些都是做好夏种工作的有利条件。
