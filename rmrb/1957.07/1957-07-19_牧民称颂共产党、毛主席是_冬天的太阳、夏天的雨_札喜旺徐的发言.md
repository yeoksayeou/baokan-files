Herdsmen Praise the Communist Party and Chairman Mao as "The Sun in Winter, The Rain in Summer"
Zha Xi Wang Xu's Speech

I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo. Looking at the development of Qinghai Province, the national financial performance in 1956 was correct, and the national budget allocation for 1957 is also appropriate. We will resolutely implement it. Now, I will report on the situation of the pilot livestock production cooperatives in Qinghai Province.

Before Liberation, a large number of herdsmen went bankrupt and became beggars; after Liberation, their economic status generally rose

Before Liberation, due to the brutal national oppression and internal tribal conflicts, the livestock production of the Tibetan and Mongolian people was in a state of stagnation for a long time. Especially during the Kuomintang rule, it suffered serious damage, and production dropped sharply. According to the 1937 data, the number of livestock in the province was 12.38 million, but by the time of liberation in 1949, it was only 7 million. The serious damage to production caused a large number of herdsmen to go bankrupt and become beggars, with the number of extremely poor households accounting for 20 percent of the total number of herdsmen.

After Liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government resolutely implemented the policy of national regional autonomy and freedom of religious belief, formulated a policy of protecting and developing livestock production, and implemented a series of policies such as "no struggle, no division, no class distinction," mutual benefit for herdsmen and herd owners, assisting poor herdsmen in developing production, and organizing mutual support between industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry. As a result, it promoted the rapid development of livestock production. By 1956, the total number of livestock in the province reached 15.96 million, an increase of 128 percent compared to 1949. With the development of production, the economic status of herdsmen has generally risen, and the number of extremely poor households has gradually decreased. According to a survey of 135 herdsmen households in the Shang A Quhu tribe of Xinghai County, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, in 1949, there were 80 extremely poor households and poor herdsmen households with less than 20 sheep, accounting for 59.25 percent of the total number of households in the tribe. By 1956, there were still 3 such poor herdsmen households, accounting for only 2 percent of the total number of households. According to a survey of 27 households in this tribe, the average living expenditure per person in 1956 was 278 yuan (the highest living expenditure per person for multi-livestock households was 781 yuan, and the average living expenditure per person for poor households was 154 yuan), indicating that the lives of herdsmen have been significantly improved.

In recent years, in the Qinghai pastoral area, national regional autonomy has been universally promoted, some unreasonable old systems have been gradually reformed, and a large number of minority cadres have been trained. The unity among and within various nationalities has been unprecedentedly consolidated and strengthened. The herdsmen all know where these happy lives come from, so they praise the Communist Party and Chairman Mao as "the sun in winter, the rain in summer," and regard their current lives as "gold and silver sun and moon."

The number of people requesting to build cooperatives and farms is increasing day by day

However, with the increasing development of production, some new problems have also been raised. The old relations of production are not adapted to the development of productive forces. In order to develop production and enhance national unity, it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation of the animal husbandry economy. After several years of progress in various tasks, people of all ethnic groups have a further understanding of socialism. Based on the above situation, since the winter of 1955, we have piloted 38 livestock production cooperatives with livestock as shares and unified management, and one jointly owned public-private livestock farm composed of five livestock owner households in areas with a good working foundation and mature conditions. The experience of piloting these cooperatives and jointly owned public-private livestock farms has proved the superiority of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. According to the statistics of 14 cooperatives: 4 cooperatives had 100 percent of members increasing their income, among which the total income of Dolan Red Star Cooperative (mainly Mongolian) increased by 47.14 percent compared with 1955; 5 cooperatives had more than 90 percent of members increasing their income, among which the total income of Tianjun Pioneer Cooperative (mainly Tibetan) increased by 47.76 percent compared with 1955; 2 cooperatives had more than 80 percent of members increasing their income; and 3 cooperatives had about 70 percent of members increasing their income. The net income of the five livestock owners in the jointly owned public-private livestock farm increased by 7,000 yuan compared with 1955. At the same time, it has played a positive role in promoting unity, improving feeding and management, improving grazing systems, preventing natural disasters, carrying out cultural learning, and training cadres. The facts of developing production and increasing the income of cooperative members have educated the herdsmen masses, making them clearly realize that socialism is happiness, thereby reducing their doubts about socialism, and the number of people requesting to build cooperatives and farms is increasing day by day.

Preliminary experience in running livestock production cooperatives

In the course of more than a year of work, we have initially explored some experience in running livestock production cooperatives. I think these experiences are roughly as follows:

1. In pastoral areas, due to the vast area and scattered residence of herdsmen, the scale of the cooperative should not be too large. According to the situation in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province, a cooperative is generally suitable for about ten households; the form of the cooperative should be low rather than high at present; all systems and methods in the cooperative should be gradually improved and improved on the basis of the original production and living habits of the herdsmen; at present, special attention should be paid to ensuring that it is not only conducive to unified management, but also fully reflects the herdsmen's private ownership of livestock.

2. Running a cooperative must adhere to the principle of being both conducive to unity and conducive to production development. In order to achieve the goal of unity, it is necessary to constantly carry out socialist education to cooperative members to improve their class consciousness; when dealing with some specific problems within the cooperative, it is necessary to pay attention to the interests of both poor households and multi-livestock households. Developing production and improving the lives of herdsmen is the purpose of carrying out socialist transformation and the key to consolidating the cooperative. Therefore, ensuring that the cooperative increases production and strives for the vast majority of members to increase their income is also a fundamental symbol of running a livestock production cooperative well.

3. It is necessary to implement the policy of voluntariness and mutual benefit. For herdsmen who urgently request to run a cooperative, we must earnestly organize them; for herdsmen who still have concerns, we must patiently work with them and be good at waiting; for poor households and multi-livestock households in the cooperative, we must treat them equally. We must resolutely implement the policy of voluntary joining and freedom of withdrawal from the cooperative. In terms of income distribution, cooperative members with more labor and less livestock or more livestock and less labor should be able to obtain reasonable income, because infringing on the interests of any party will have an adverse impact on the development of livestock production.

4. Implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief and doing a good job in the united front work of national and religious upper-class figures have a great effect on the socialist transformation of pastoral areas. During the pilot period of the cooperative or when dealing with major issues related to the cooperative, full consultation with local representatives from all walks of life and striving for their sympathy and support are beneficial to running the cooperative well. In the process of carrying out socialist transformation, if the role of national and religious representatives is ignored and their patriotic ideology and enthusiasm for building socialism are not fully utilized, it will inevitably have an adverse impact on the socialist transformation of animal husbandry.

According to the central government's guidelines and policies on implementing socialist transformation of the animal husbandry economy, combined with the characteristics of Qinghai's pastoral areas and animal husbandry economy, we particularly emphasized the spirit of broad policies, stable steps, and long time when specifically implementing socialist transformation of the animal husbandry economy. Various policies that have been effective in the pastoral areas must be firmly and unswervingly continued to be implemented during the socialist transformation.

Facts have proved that as long as national relations are united, social order is stable, the masses have demands, representatives also express their support, and there are also cooperative-running cadres of their own nationality, then there are not many difficulties in running livestock production cooperatives in areas with an existing foundation of mutual aid production.

For the transformation of livestock owner economy, we resolutely implemented the policy of peaceful transformation, that is, we adopted the methods of economic redemption and political unity and arrangement. In terms of the form of transformation, we listened to the livestock owners' voluntariness. They can join the production cooperative, or organize a jointly owned public-private livestock farm, or have their livestock raised by state-owned, jointly owned public-private livestock farms and cooperatives. If they do not adopt the above forms, they are also allowed to continue to operate independently, and the state will still give them assistance. As a result of this approach, it has played a good role in stabilizing the hearts of the people in the pastoral areas, eliminating livestock owners' concerns, and developing livestock production.

Moving towards a happy and bright road

Undoubtedly, the achievements we have made in our work in the pastoral areas are very significant. However, there are also many shortcomings and errors. For example, at the beginning of the pilot cooperative, there was a hasty mood of being greedy for greatness and quick success, pursuing advanced forms, and trying to reach the sky in one step; the publicity and explanation work among the herdsmen masses and the consultation work with representatives were not done enough; a few cadres even had a coercive and commanding style, and there was once a phenomenon of a small number of people requesting to withdraw from the cooperative. It should be admitted that these shortcomings and errors have brought certain losses to the work, but the reason for the problems is mainly because we lack experience in this area and do not understand the characteristics and situation of the pastoral areas well enough, which is by no means caused by collectivization itself. Some people see the shortcomings in the work and completely deny the achievements, doubt the collectivization policy, and even oppose the socialist transformation of the animal husbandry economy, which we believe is extremely inappropriate. The people of the Qinghai pastoral area firmly believe that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we gradually complete the socialist transformation of the animal husbandry economy, so as to forever get rid of the state of poverty and move towards a happy and bright road.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of all ethnic groups in the pastoral areas have achieved great achievements, which no one can deny or deny. The rightists said that the government's work was "a complete mess," which is a complete fabrication. We minority people resolutely oppose the rightists' crazy attack on the Party and the people of all ethnic groups. We must resolutely fight the rightists to the end.

The above speech may have inappropriate parts, please correct me, representatives.

### 牧民称颂共产党、毛主席是“冬天的太阳、夏天的雨”   札喜旺徐的发言

    牧民称颂共产党、毛主席是“冬天的太阳、夏天的雨”
    札喜旺徐的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和李先念、薄一波副总理的报告。以青海省的发展情况看，一九五六年国家财政执行情况是正确的，一九五七年的国家预算分配也是适宜的，我们坚决贯彻执行。现在我就青海省试办畜牧业生产合作社的一些情况，作如下汇报。
    解放前大批牧民破产沦为乞丐；解放后经济地位普遍上升
    解放前，由于残酷的民族压迫和民族内部部落间的对立，使藏族和蒙古族人民的畜牧业生产，长期处于停滞状态，特别在国民党统治时代，更遭受到严重的破坏，生产急剧下降，根据一九三七年的资料，全省牲畜头数为一千二百三十八万头，到一九四九年解放时，仅有七百万头。生产的严重破坏，使大批牧民破产沦为乞丐，赤贫户达牧民总数的百分之二十。
    解放后，共产党和人民政府坚决贯彻了民族区域自治和宗教信仰自由的政策，制订了保护与发展畜牧业生产的方针，贯彻执行了“不斗不分，不划阶级”、牧工牧主两利、扶助贫苦牧民发展生产、组织工、农、牧业相互支援等一系列的政策，因而，促进了畜牧业生产的迅速发展，到一九五六年，全省牲畜总数达到一千五百九十六万头，较一九四九年增加了百分之一百二十八。随着生产的发展，牧民的经济地位普遍上升，赤贫户已经逐渐减少。根据海南藏族自治州兴海县上阿曲乎部落一百三十五户牧民的调查，一九四九年有赤贫户和折合不足二十只羊的贫苦牧民八十户，占全部落总户数的百分之五十九点二五，到一九五六年，这样的贫苦牧民还有三户，仅占总户数的百分之二了。又根据这个部落二十七户的调查，一九五六年每人平均生活支出为二百七十八元（多畜户每人最高生活支出为七百八十一元，贫苦户每人平均生活支出为一百五十四元），说明牧民的生活已经有了显著的改善。
    几年来，青海牧业区在普遍地推行了民族区域自治，逐步地对一些不合理的旧制度进行改革，并且培养了大批的少数民族干部的情况下，各民族间和民族内部的团结空前地巩固和增强了。牧民们都懂得这些幸福生活是那里来的，因而他们称颂共产党、毛主席是“冬天的太阳、夏天的雨”，把现在的生活看成是“金银日月”一般。
    要求建社办场的人日有增加
    但是，随着生产的日益发展，也提出了一些新的问题，旧的生产关系和生产力的发展是不相适应的，为了发展生产，为了增强民族团结，因而，对畜牧业经济就需要进行社会主义改造，而经过几年来各项工作的进展，各族人民对社会主义已有了进一步的认识。根据上述的情况，从一九五五年冬季以来，我们在工作基础较好、条件成熟的地区，试办了三十八个以牲畜入股、统一经营为特点的畜牧业生产合作社和一个由五户牧主组成的公私合营牧场。试办这些合作社和公私合营牧场的经验证明了畜牧业社会主义改造的优越性，根据十四个社的统计：百分之百的社员增加收入的有四个社，其中都兰红星社
  （主要是蒙古族）总收入较一九五五年增加了百分之四十七点一四；百分之九十以上的社员增加收入的有五个社，其中天峻先锋社（主要是藏族）总收入较一九五五年增加了百分之四十七点七六；百分之八十以上的社员增加收入的有两个社；百分之七十左右的社员增加收入的有三个社。公私合营牧场五户牧主的纯收入，较一九五五年增加了七千元。同时，对增进团结、改善饲放管理、改进放牧制度、防御自然灾害、开展文化学习、培养干部都起了积极的作用。发展生产和增加社员收入的事实教育了牧民群众，使他们清楚地认识到：社会主义是幸福的，从而减少了对社会主义的疑虑，要求建社办场的人日有增加。
    办畜牧业生产合作社的初步经验
    在一年多的工作过程中，我们对办畜牧业生产合作社，初步地摸索了一些经验。这些经验，我认为大体上有以下几点：
    1、在牧业区，由于地区辽阔，牧民居住分散，社的规模不宜过大。按照青海省牧业区的情况，一个社一般以十户左右为宜；合作社的形式，目前宜低不宜高；社内的一切制度和办法，要在牧民原有生产、生活习惯的基础上，逐步改进和提高；在目前，要特别注意既有利于统一经营，又能充分体现牧民对牲畜的私有权。
    2、办社必须坚持既有利于团结，又有利于生产发展的原则。为了达到团结的目的，要经常地向社员进行社会主义教育，以提高其阶级觉悟；处理社内的一些具体问题的时候，必须注意到贫苦户和多畜户双方的利益。发展生产，改善牧民的生活，是进行社会主义改造的目的，也是巩固合作社的关键。因此，保证合作社增加生产，争取绝大多数社员增加收入，同样是办好畜牧业生产合作社的根本标志。
    3、必须贯彻自愿互利政策，对于迫切要求办社的牧民，要认真地把他们组织起来；对于还有顾虑的牧民，要耐心地向他们进行工作，善于等待；对于社内的贫苦户和多畜户，要平等相待。要坚决执行入社自愿、退社自由的方针。在收益分配方面，要使劳力多、牲畜少或牲畜多、劳力少的社员，都能得到合理的收益，因为侵犯了任何一方面的利益，都将对发展畜牧业生产发生不利的影响。
    4、贯彻宗教信仰自由的政策和做好民族、宗教上层人士的统一战线工作，对于牧业区的社会主义改造有很大作用。在试办合作社期间或者在处理有关社内外的重大问题的时候，同当地各方面的代表人士进行充分的协商，争取他们的同情和支持，对于办好合作社有好处。在进行社会主义改造的过程中，如果忽视民族、宗教代表人士的作用，不充分发挥他们的爱国主义思想和建设社会主义的热情，也势必对畜牧业社会主义改造事业发生不利的影响。
    根据中央对畜牧业经济实行社会主义改造的方针政策，结合青海牧业区和畜牧业经济的特点，在具体执行的时候，我们特别强调了对畜牧业经济进行社会主义改造必须本着政策宽、步骤稳和时间长的精神。在牧业区行之有效的各项政策，在社会主义改造的时候，必须坚定不移地继续贯彻下去。
    事实证明：只要民族关系是团结的，社会秩序是安定的，群众有要求，代表人士也表示赞助，同时又有了本民族的办社干部，那么，在已有互助生产基础的地区举办畜牧业生产合作社，困难是不多的。
    对于牧主经济的改造，我们则坚决地贯彻了和平改造的方针，即采取了在经济上赎买和在政治上团结、安排的办法。在改造的形式上，听取牧主的自愿，可以加入生产合作社，也可以组织公私合营牧场，或者由国营、公私合营牧场和合作社代放他们的牲畜，不采取以上形式，也允许继续单独经营，国家仍然给以帮助。这样作法的结果，对于安定牧业区人心、消除牧主顾虑和发展畜牧业生产，都起了良好的作用。
    走向幸福光明的大道
    无疑的，我们在牧业区工作中所取得的成绩是很显著的。但是，缺点和错误也是不少的，例如，在开始试办合作社的时候，曾出现了贪大求快，追求高级形式，企图一步登天的急躁情绪；在牧民群众中的宣传解释工作和同代表人士的协商工作，都做得不够；少数干部甚至还有强迫命令的作风，一度产生过少数人要求退社的现象。应该承认，这些缺点和错误，曾给工作带来了一定的损失，但是，问题产生的原因，主要是由于我们缺乏这方面的经验，对牧业区的特点和情况还了解得不够所致，绝不是由于合作化本身所引起的。有些人看到工作中的缺点，就全盘否定成绩，怀疑合作化政策，甚至反对对畜牧业经济进行社会主义改造，我们认为这是极不应该的。青海牧业区人民坚决地相信，只有在中国共产党、毛主席的领导下，逐步地完成对畜牧业经济的社会主义改造，才能永远摆脱贫困的状态，走向幸福光明的大道。
    牧业区各族人民在党和政府的领导下，已经取得了伟大的成就，这是任何人都不能否认，也否认不了的。右派分子说政府工作“一团糟”，是彻头彻尾的造谣，我们少数民族人民坚决反对右派分子对党和各族人民的疯狂进攻，我们要和右派分子坚决斗争到底。
    以上发言，可能有不妥之处，请各位代表指正。
