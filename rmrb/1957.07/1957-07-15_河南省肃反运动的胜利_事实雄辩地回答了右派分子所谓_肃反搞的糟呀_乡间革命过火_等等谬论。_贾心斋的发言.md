My speech

I fully support Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government. I fully agree with the work reports made by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen. I am willing to earnestly study and implement the spirit of these reports, and strive for socialist construction under the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

Now, I will only report to the conference on the situation of the anti-counterrevolutionary work in Henan Province, using ironclad facts to refute the rightists' anti-Party, anti-socialist, and absurd remarks of viciously attacking the people.

In 1955, when the high tide of the socialist revolution was about to arrive, the remaining counter-revolutionary elements frantically carried out various sabotage activities. In order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and defend socialist construction, in the second half of 1955, our province launched an anti-counterrevolutionary struggle, and arrested a group of counter-revolutionary elements who were guilty of heinous crimes, resolutely hostile to the people, and continued to carry out sabotage activities, as well as those organized and hidden counter-revolutionary groups. In Taikang County, Guo Xinpo, the counter-revolutionary bandit leader who used cruel methods such as chopping with knives, burning with fire, disemboweling, cutting tongues, and gouging eyes, was captured, responsible for killing 128 of our cadres and masses. The Anyang Public Security Bureau captured Wu Lantian, the head of the pseudo "Exterminate Communism Work Group." This criminal killed more than 160 Communist Party members, cadres, and militiamen in the Huaxian area alone from 1940 to 1945. In February 1956, Nanyang County cracked down on the counter-revolutionary organization "Chinese Peasants' United Party." They had a party program and constitution, roamed the junction of Nanyang, Tanghe, and Xinye counties, developed counter-revolutionary organizations, and attempted to occupy Tanghe, Biyang, Xinye, Xiangyang, Fancheng and other counties, claiming to cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek's counter-attack on the mainland. The Xuchang Public Security Bureau cracked down on the "Zhongtiandao" organization. The Dao leaders Zhang Zicheng, Zhang Yong'an, etc. secretly developed more than 180 Dao believers in the Shangcheng, Shangcai, Xihua, Linying, and Yancheng county areas, conspiring to riot. In addition, some special agents and spies who had been lurking for a long time to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities were also arrested, such as Fan Jiayuan and Wang Ruoping, sent by the Chiang Kai-shek special agent "Internal Investigation Bureau." In April 1955, they pretended to be a couple and infiltrated our Kaifeng City Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company to work. They repeatedly reported the situation to the special agent leader of the bandits living in South Vietnam, and instructed their younger sister to marry an officer of our artillery school in an attempt to collect our military intelligence. During the arrest, the criminal was found to have tools for repairing radio stations and radio station password evidence. Another example is Fu Ping, the "Action Column Leader of the Southern Section of the Pinghan Road" sent by the "Chiang Special Committee," the so-called "all-purpose special agent." In 1956, he sneaked into the Xinyang area of ​​our province in an attempt to manufacture detonator explosives to destroy the bridges of the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. During the cracking of the case, evidence of his crime of using chemically soaked underpants and socks was seized.

In 1956, according to the changes in the enemy's situation, we launched a political offensive and further implemented a lenient policy, calling on counter-revolutionary elements to voluntarily surrender to the government. Among the counter-revolutionary elements who surrendered themselves within a year, many were fugitive and newly advanced counter-revolutionary elements with serious crimes and great popular indignation. At the same time, a large number of weapons and reactionary documents were seized in the political offensive. According to statistics, a total of 16 machine guns, 1,129 rifles, 80,757 rounds of various bullets, and more than 70,000 other counter-revolutionary material documents were seized.

After our country achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution last year, the domestic political situation has undergone fundamental changes. Based on this situation, in 1956, our province, in accordance with the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program, combined with the rectification of agricultural cooperatives, mobilized the masses to evaluate landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements, and incorporated them into the cooperative for supervision and transformation. In the labor transformation, most of them turned to the good direction, and the number of people who had their landlord and rich peasant hats removed and their components changed increased day by day.

Last year, Henan also achieved great success in the anti-counterrevolutionary movement carried out internally, and uncovered a group of counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements, including special agents, murderers who caused great public outrage, and hooligans with extremely bad character. For example, Zhang Jinyu, a technician at the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, was a special agent sent by the "Chiang Special Committee" and the "Free China Labor League." After sneaking into the factory, he pretended to be active on the surface, but secretly provoked discord, instigated workers to leave the factory, and reported the factory's production, equipment, personnel and other information to the Hong Kong special agent agency. The Zhengzhou Railway Administration found a seven-member Central Statistics Bureau special agent group headed by Duan Shuangyin. The entire group has been hiding since liberation. Duan Shuangyin once infiltrated our Communist Youth League and served as a member of the League branch committee. Qin Huixiang of Xinyang Coal Construction Company once served as the deputy head of Yan Xishan's assassination group and was a counter-revolutionary element with bloody debts for the massacre of fifteen people. Cheng Shaoyao of the Huai River Harnessing Machinery General Team defected in 1940 and served as a Japanese intelligence officer and a Kuomintang returning home regiment platoon leader. He beat to death three people, including our district chief and county government section chief, and set their bodies on fire, seizing more than 20 guns. This criminal fled during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries due to great public indignation, and the masses tied a paper figurine to replace Cheng and executed him. Li Centao, a teacher at the Yiyang County No. 1 Junior Middle School in Luoyang Prefecture, was a district captain of the Three Youth Leagues. He consistently raped and played with male and female students, totaling 47 people, and repeatedly refused to mend his ways. There are many similar examples, which cannot be listed one by one. In colleges and universities, a group of current counter-revolutionary elements with conclusive evidence were also exposed, and there were even more people who had reactionary and criminal behavior in history. In addition, a large number of weapons and ammunition were handed over during the movement. According to preliminary statistics: 592 various guns, 2 cannons, a box of shells, 10 machine guns, 13,510 rounds of ammunition, and a large number of reactionary documents were handed over.

The above achievements and facts eloquently refute the rightists' absurd arguments such as: "The anti-counterrevolutionary movement was a mess" and "The revolution in the countryside went too far," and slander the activists as "reconnaissance is a special agent," and slander the anti-counterrevolutionary movement as creating "the period of Qin Shihuang, occasionally speaking to abandon the market" and other fallacies. These absurd remarks by the rightists show that they are ignoring the achievements of the anti-counterrevolutionary movement with their conscience and closing their eyes, and prominently demonstrate their anti-people and anti-socialist essence. The result of our anti-counterrevolutionary movement is good. It not only basically eliminated the counter-revolutionary elements, but also significantly reduced counter-revolutionary cases and sabotage accidents compared with the past, and the social order has become more stable. At the same time, it has also purified the internal affairs, clarified some problems that have been hanging for many years by some comrades, and improved the consciousness of the masses, thus creating a new atmosphere of unity and production and active work, and further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship. Facts have proved that the anti-counterrevolutionary movement is completely necessary. Our ability to achieve victory in the anti-counterrevolutionary struggle is the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government.

First of all, the policy of "combining suppression with leniency" was conscientiously implemented. In addition to punishing counter-revolutionary elements who committed serious crimes, caused great public indignation, and carried out current sabotage activities, all counter-revolutionary elements who voluntarily surrendered and confessed their crimes were given lenient treatment.

Secondly, the principle of "raising vigilance, eliminating all special agents, preventing deviations, and not wrongly accusing a good person" put forward by Chairman Mao was conscientiously implemented, and each counter-revolutionary case was investigated and studied, and the spirit of handling affairs in accordance with the law was implemented.

Thirdly, the mass line was implemented, and extensive publicity work was carried out. It was an extremely profound political education for the broad masses of workers, peasants, cadres, and intellectuals. In the movement, it enabled them to draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, raised their vigilance, and improved their ability to identify counter-revolutionary elements and their enthusiasm for fighting against the enemy. The masses enthusiastically reported many counter-revolutionary elements with serious crimes and deep concealment. The movement proved that only by closely combining specialized agencies with the broad masses can all cunning enemies be defeated.

Some shortcomings and mistakes have also occurred in the anti-counterrevolutionary movement. A small number of people who could have been arrested without being arrested were arrested, and some people who had general historical problems but should not have been treated as counter-revolutionary elements were also fought. Some excessive phenomena were also discovered in the middle of the struggle, but these phenomena were promptly corrected after they were discovered. Of course, the shortcomings and mistakes found in the anti-counterrevolutionary movement, although they are extremely few and individual problems, must be taken as a warning.

Due to the victory of the three major transformations, the changes in the economic base, and the victory of the anti-counterrevolutionary movement in recent years, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been basically eliminated. However, there are still counter-revolutionary elements who continue to carry out sabotage activities; in particular, imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are still actively sending special agents and spies to undermine our socialist construction cause. Therefore, we cannot relax our vigilance against the enemy struggle, further strengthen our work, implement the principle of "counter-revolutionary elements must be eliminated, and mistakes must be corrected," and conscientiously implement Chairman Mao's instruction on "correctly handling the problem of contradictions among the people," draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves, continue to fight against counter-revolutionary elements, and strive to protect the smooth progress of socialist construction and the safety of people's lives and property!

Please point out whether the above speech is appropriate!

    河南省肃反运动的胜利
    事实雄辩地回答了右派分子所谓“肃反搞的糟呀”“乡间革命过火”等等谬论。
    贾心斋的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告和周总理关于政府工作的报告，完全同意李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长兼秘书长所作的各项工作报告，我愿意认真的学习和贯彻执行这些报告的精神，在中国共产党的领导下为社会主义建设而奋斗。
    现在我仅把河南省的肃反工作情况向大会报告一下，以铁一般的事实来驳斥右派分子反党、反社会主义，向人民进行恶毒进攻的荒谬言论。
    一九五五年在社会主义革命高潮即将到来的时候，残余的反革命分子又疯狂地进行各种破坏活动。为了巩固人民民主专政，保卫社会主义建设，在一九五五年的下半年我省开展了肃反斗争，对那些罪大恶极、坚决与人民为敌、继续进行破坏活动的反革命分子和那些有组织的隐蔽的反革命集团依法逮捕了一批。太康县捕获了以刀铡、火烫、剖腹、割舌、挖眼等残酷手段，杀害我干部和群众一百二十八名的反革命匪首郭馨坡。安阳公安处捕获了伪“灭共工作团”团长吴兰田，该犯一九四零年至一九四五年间，仅在滑县一带即杀害共产党员、干部和民兵一百六十余名。南阳县一九五六年二月破获了反革命组织“中国农民联合党”，他们有党纲党章，流窜于南阳、唐河、新野三县结合部，发展反革命组织，企图占据唐河、泌阳、新野、襄阳、樊城等县，声言配合蒋介石反攻大陆。许昌公安处破获了“中天道”的组织，道首张自成、张永安等在商城、上蔡、西华、临?、郾城等县地区秘密发展道徒一百八十余名，阴谋进行暴乱，此外还捕获了一些长期潜伏进行反革命破坏活动的特务、间谍分子，如蒋特“内调局”派遣的樊家源、王若萍，他们于一九五五年四月冒充夫妇打入我开封市花纱布公司工作，曾多次向匪住南越特务头子报告情况，并且指示其妹与我炮校军官结婚，企图搜集我军事情报，在逮捕时查出该犯修理电台工具和电台密码罪证。又如“蒋特中委会”派遣的“平汉路南段行动纵队长”，所谓“万能特务”扶平，他于一九五六年潜入我省信阳一带，企图制造雷管炸药，破坏我京汉铁路南段的桥梁。在破案中缴出他用化学药品浸透过的裤头、袜子等罪证。
    一九五六年根据敌情的变化，我们开展了政治攻势，进一步实行了宽大政策，号召反革命分子自动向政府投案自首。一年中投案自首的反革命分子，其中有不少是罪恶严重、民愤很大的漏网和新进的反革命分子。同时在政治攻势中还缴获了大批武器和反动证件，据统计共缴获机枪十六挺，长枪一千一百二十九枝，各种子弹八万零七百五十七发，其他反动物资证件七万余件。
    在去年我国社会主义革命取得决定性的胜利以后，国内政治形势已经发生了根本变化。根据这一情况，一九五六年我省按照全国农业发展纲要中的规定，结合整顿农业合作社，发动群众对地主、富农分子和反革命分子进行评议，把他们纳入社内监督改造，在劳动改造中多数向好的方向转变，摘掉地主、富农帽子，改变成分的一天天加多。
    河南去年在内部开展的肃反运动也取得了很大成绩，查出了一批反革命分子和其他坏分子，其中有特务分子、民愤很大的杀人凶犯和品质极端恶劣的流氓分子等。如郑州纺织机械厂技术员张锦玉，是“蒋特中委会”“自由中国劳工同盟”派遣的特务，混入该厂后，表面伪装积极，暗地则挑拨离间，策动工人离厂，并且将该厂生产、设备、人员等情况，向香港特务机关汇报。郑州铁路管理局，查出以段双印为组长的一个七人中统特务小组，全组从解放隐蔽至今。段双印曾混入我青年团担任团支部委员。信阳煤建公司秦会祥，曾经任阎锡山的暗杀团团副，是残杀十五条人命血债累累的反革命分子。治淮机械总队程少瑶，一九四零年叛变后担任日寇情报员，国民党还乡团分队长，曾打死我区长、县府科长等三人并纵火焚尸，夺枪二十余枝，该犯因民愤大在镇反时潜逃，群众即扎一纸人代替程犯枪毙。洛阳专区宜阳县第一初级中学教员李岑涛是三青团区队长，一贯奸污玩弄男女学生共达四十七人，屡教不改。类似以上例子很多，不能一一枚举。在大专学校中也搞出一批证据确凿的现行反革命分子，在历史上有反动罪恶行为的就更多。除此之外，在运动中还缴出大量武器和弹药，根据初步统计：交出各种枪五百九十二枝，炮两门，炮弹一箱，机枪十挺，子弹一万三千五百一十发，及大量反动证件。
    以上成绩和事实，雄辩地回答了右派分子所谓：“肃反搞的糟呀”，“乡间革命过火”，并且诬蔑积极分子“侦察情况是特务”，诬蔑肃反运动造成了“秦始皇时期偶语弃市”等谬论，右派分子的这些荒谬言论说明了他们昧着良心，闭着眼睛抹煞肃反成绩，突出地表现出他们的反人民反社会主义的本质。我们的肃反运动结果是良好的，不仅基本上肃清了反革命分子，反革命案件和破坏事故较前显著的减少，社会秩序更加稳定了，同时也纯洁了内部，把一部分同志多年来悬而未决的问题弄清了，群众的觉悟也提高了，因而出现了团结生产、积极工作的新气象，更进一步的巩固了人民民主专政，事实证明了肃反运动是完全必要的。我们能够取得肃反斗争的胜利，是由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导的结果。
    首先，是认真地贯彻执行了“镇压与宽大相结合”的政策。我们除了对罪恶严重、民愤很大和进行现行破坏活动的反革命分子予以惩办外，凡自动投案自首坦白罪恶的反革命分子，均进行了宽大处理。
    其次，认真执行了毛主席提出的“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子，防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”的方针，对每一个反革命案件均进行了调查研究，贯彻执行了依法办事的精神。
    再次，贯彻执行了群众路线，广泛的开展了宣传工作，对广大工人、农民、干部、知识分子是一次极其深刻的政治教育，在运动中使他们划清了敌我界限，提高了警惕，提高了识别反革命分子的能力和对敌斗争的积极性。群众热烈的检举了许多罪恶重大，隐蔽很深的反革命分子，在运动中证明专门机关与广大群众紧密的结合起来，才能战胜一切狡猾的敌人。
    在肃反运动中也发生过一些缺点和错误，曾捕了少数虽有罪也可以不捕的人，也斗了虽有一般历史问题但不应该当作反革命分子来斗争的人，在斗争中间也曾经发现一些过火的现象，但在这些现象被发现以后就及时纠正了。当然，在肃反中所发现的缺点和错误，虽然是极少数和个别的问题，也必须引以为戒。
    由于三大改造的胜利，经济基础的变化和几年来肃反运动的胜利，反革命残余势力已经基本上肃清了，但是还有反革命分子，仍不断的进行破坏活动；特别是帝国主义与蒋介石集团，仍积极地派遣特务间谍，来破坏我们的社会主义建设事业，因而，我们还不能放松对敌斗争的警惕，进一步的加强工作，贯彻执行“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，认真执行毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示，划清敌我界限，继续同反革命分子作斗争，以保卫社会主义建设事业的顺利进行和人民生命财产的安全而奋斗！
    以上发言是否有当，请指正！
