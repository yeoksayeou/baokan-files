    Our Country's Great Achievements in Disaster Relief
    ——Refuting the Rightists' Slander that "The People's Government is Ineffective in Disaster Relief"
    Xiong Tianjing, Director of the Rural Relief Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs

    Recently, bourgeois rightists have launched a frenzied attack on the leadership of the Party and the socialist system from all sides. In the area of disaster relief work, they have spread many slanders with a gloating attitude. They said that "the People's Government is ineffective in disaster relief," "the people in the disaster areas are suffering terribly," and "the masses are on the verge of death." I am responsible for the specific work of disaster relief and it is necessary to make a brief introduction to the situation of disaster relief work and the great achievements made since the founding of the country, to help people from all walks of life further recognize the insidious conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists.

    The Tragic Situation After Disasters in History

    Historically, our country has been a disaster-prone country. This is not only because our country has long been under the rule of reactionary classes, social productivity is very low, and the agricultural economy is very backward, making it impossible for people to have full control over natural disasters. More importantly, successive ruling classes, especially the Kuomintang reactionaries, not only did not provide disaster relief, but directly created disasters. They over-felled forests and destroyed water conservancy, causing disasters to increase and become more serious with each generation; and they took advantage of the people's plight, levied exorbitant taxes, and made a fortune from disasters. Therefore, whenever a disaster occurred, an extremely tragic scene was presented. "Thousands of miles of red land," "nine out of ten houses empty," "starving corpses on the roads," and "people eating human flesh" are commonly seen phrases in historical records. Although the fertility rate of our country's population is high, the population growth rate in the past was not very large. In 1835, that is, the 15th year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, the national population was 401.76 million, and after more than 100 years in the Kuomintang era, it was still only 450 million. One of the main reasons for this is that a large number of people often died from disasters. According to the "History of Famine Relief in China": In the Qing Dynasty, the statistics for the eight years of Jiaqing 15th and 16th years, Daoguang 26th year, Xianfeng 7th year, Guangxu 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 14th years showed that 65.78 million people died from disasters; during the Kuomintang rule, statistics for the sixteen years from 1920 to 1936 also showed that 18.35 million people died from disasters. Of course, the records are not complete. These tragic histories, histories that young people cannot imagine, were immediately reversed after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the eight years since the founding of the country, the disaster-stricken area has been at most 229 million mu (1956) and at least 56 million mu (1951); the disaster-stricken population has been at most 74 million (1956) and at least 27 million (1952). In 1954, the year with the most serious disaster, 15,551 people died from the disaster; in 1956, 10,679 people died from the disaster. The vast majority of them were drowned in situations where they could not escape in time due to levee breaches, mountain floods, or tidal surges; only 44 people actually starved to death in 1954, and only 578 in 1956. This is incomparable to the situation in the old society where hundreds of thousands, millions, or even tens of millions of people died after disasters.

    Important Instructions of the Party and the Government on Disaster Relief Work

    In 1949, the People's Republic of China was founded, facing the dilapidated situation left by imperialism and reactionary ruling classes for many years. The first thing to do was how to overcome the current extraordinary disaster. The State Council's instructions on production and disaster relief in December 1949 stated: "The people's governments and people's organizations at all levels must pay high attention and recognize that production and disaster relief is a matter of life and death for millions of people, a matter of consolidating the new democratic regime in disaster areas, and a key issue in launching the major production campaign and building a new China next year. It is absolutely impermissible to adopt a bureaucratic attitude of indifference to this issue." The supplementary instructions on production and disaster relief from the Ministry of Internal Affairs in January 1950 stated: "The people's governments at all levels must take a high degree of responsibility for disaster relief and must not let a single person starve to death! Those who do not understand the disaster situation, are unprepared for the spring famine, and have no way to deal with the coming hunger should be punished; on the contrary, they are meritorious servants of the people and should be rewarded." The central government clearly put forward the disaster relief policy: "Production for self-relief, thrift to survive the famine, mutual assistance among the masses, supplemented by necessary government relief." In the past few years, the people's governments at all levels and the broad masses of cadres and people have resolutely implemented this policy, created a series of effective methods, and taken various effective actions to overcome the severe disasters such as the once-in-a-century flood, the once-in-fifty-year typhoon, the once-in-decades drought, and the historically rare frost, time and time again. Not only did very few people starve to death, but no matter how big the disaster or the area with continuous disasters, production could be quickly restored and a good harvest could be strived for, creating many miracles that had never been seen in history!

    Great Achievements in Disaster Relief Work

    Rescue Work When Disasters Strike

    In order to change the natural landscape and increase the ability to resist disasters, the country has taken many great measures in the fundamental treatment of rivers, large and small water conservancy projects, soil and water conservation, and afforestation projects, and these measures have already or are playing a role. However, due to the vast territory of our country and the complex natural conditions, the efforts of the past few years since liberation are not enough to completely control natural disasters. Therefore, disasters of varying degrees still occur in these years. But disasters can be resisted. When a disaster occurs, party and government leaders at all levels always regard rescue as the overriding task, mobilizing millions and tens of millions of cadres and people to invest in the struggle against flood prevention, disaster relief, drought resistance, frost prevention, and insect capture. Small disasters can be completely eliminated, and large disasters can reduce losses. The flood in the Jianghuai River basin in 1954 was larger than that in 1931. In 1931, Wuhan City was flooded for four months and countless people died. In 1954, the water level in Wuhan City was nearly three meters higher than when it breached in 1931. The people of the city lived in the encirclement of water and fought the flood for three months with extreme calmness and order. The dikes rose with the water, and finally drove back the flood. In this year, six heavily disaster-stricken provinces including Anhui and Hubei transferred more than 13 million disaster victims rescued to non-disaster areas. Where the disaster victims went, the cadres went, and the supplies went. The property that the disaster victims could carry was not lost, and no accidents occurred from the transfer to the return. An old gentleman said: If I hadn't inspected it myself, I almost couldn't believe that such a thing could happen. The power of the people is truly great! 1956 was another year of major flooding. The water level of the Songhua River in Harbin City was two or three meters higher than the city surface. Under the heroic resistance of the people of the city, the safety of the city was also ensured. In this year, the coastal provinces also carried out the struggle against typhoons: After receiving the warning, Shanghai City completed the defense work in a very short time, effectively protecting the lives and property of the people of the city, and the losses were minimal. The hundreds of miles of sea dikes and river embankments in Jiangsu Province blocked the impact of typhoons and tides. In addition, large-scale drought resistance has also achieved great results. In the spring of 1952, a nationwide drought prevention and resistance movement was launched, and canals were built and wells were dug, expanding the irrigated area by more than 32.4 million mu, which played a huge role in ensuring the good harvest of that year; last year, Hunan suffered a severe drought, and cooperatives organized members to draw water over mountains and across streams, finally turning the drought into a "scattered disaster." Another example is large-scale frost prevention. Although large-scale frosts rarely seen in history were encountered in 1953 and 1954, the provinces mobilized the masses to water and save seedlings, finally saving the harvest. Such deeds are too numerous to mention. In every struggle to rescue disasters, the broad masses of cadres have been selfless, guarding wherever there is danger. Among the cadres who sacrificed for disaster resistance, there were county heads, township heads, company and platoon leaders of the army, and other cadres and activists. In the 1954 struggle to defend Wuhan City alone, 108 outstanding comrades sacrificed themselves. The above-mentioned great deeds have never happened in history.

    Recovery Work After a Disaster

    The most important task after a disaster is to restore production. We have seized on this point, and the slogan is "production for disaster relief." Developing temporary side occupations is a stopgap measure, while restoring and developing the original agricultural and sideline occupations is a fundamental solution. After floods and typhoons, breaching and restoring embankments, draining water and planting wheat, rushing to plant late autumn crops, repairing houses, etc.; after frosts and droughts, rescuing seedlings, strengthening field management, rushing to transport seeds, and implementing replanting and changing planting, etc. These often require huge financial and human resources, and require extensive mobilization and meticulous organization. In 1954, the Jianghuai River basin suffered a major flood that had not been seen in a century. The disaster-stricken provinces, disaster areas, and non-disaster areas worked together to use various methods to strive for more grain harvest. The five provinces of Hubei, Anhui, etc. harvested a total of 7.9 billion jin of grain, which played a huge role in easing the disaster situation. Coupled with sideline production, a few months later, in the spring of 1955, except for some houses that were still sheds, the disaster situation was no longer visible. This was still the situation before cooperation. After cooperation, people were organized, and materials, tools, and funds were concentrated, making the power of production for self-relief even stronger, and the recovery of production in the disaster areas was faster and better. In 1956, the flood in Hebei Province was the largest, but Hebei Province planted more than 38 million mu of wheat, exceeding the highest wheat planting area in history. During this period, statistics from five provinces including Hebei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Hunan showed that the sideline income of disaster victims reached 408 million yuan, which could buy more than 4 billion jin of grain. This provides a strong guarantee for the current and future lives of the people in the disaster areas. This is how it was done in the first few years after liberation, when our country's economic strength was still very weak, and it is still done this way now, which makes us no longer see the tragic scenes after disasters in history, and can confidently overcome disasters and create a life of food, clothing, shelter, and work by relying on the power of the masses themselves.

    The High Concern of the Party and the Government for the People in Disaster Areas

    Vigorously Carry Out Relief and Support

    Disaster victims mainly rely on production for self-relief to survive the famine. The government has made great efforts to provide relief and support to disaster victims who cannot produce or whose production is not enough to support themselves. Every year, the state allocates a large amount of funds for production and disaster relief. In the eight years since the founding of the country, the state has issued a total of more than 1.29 billion yuan in relief funds, of which more than 370 million yuan has been allocated to various disaster areas from the disaster in 1956 to the present, plus the loans used for flood prevention, disaster relief, breach blocking, and distribution in disaster areas, totaling 860 million yuan. For the relief item alone, calculated at 2.5 yuan per person per month, it can maintain the life of more than 24.6 million people for half a year. Among them, Hebei Province alone issued 110.4 million yuan in relief funds. The disaster victims receiving relief generally account for 40% in heavily disaster-stricken areas, and up to 70% in some areas, and 20% in lightly disaster-stricken areas. Last winter alone, 4.26 million people were rescued. In order to make the relief fair and reasonable, we advocated the principle of "combining leadership mastery with democratic evaluation." In the process of implementing this principle, various localities have created many good distribution methods. For example, Hunan and Jiangsu's "one-time evaluation, phased distribution," Hebei's "fixed work production, fixed quota relief," and many areas' combined distribution of relief funds, loans, and preferential treatment funds have all achieved good results. In particular, whenever disaster victims are in critical condition, the broad masses of rural cadres overcome difficulties and personally go to the door to provide relief, so that disaster victims can turn danger into safety. After the great flood in the Jianghuai River basin in 1954, it was followed by cold waves and heavy snow. Many cadres led the masses to break ice, sweep snow, build bridges, and open roads, so that the supply of materials in the disaster areas was not interrupted by the wind and snow. Moreover, they carried grain, funds, and clothing to visit and rescue households one by one, so that the disaster victims besieged by wind and snow were spared from hunger and cold. There are many similar situations. Which government in history has provided so much support to the people in disaster areas? There has never been one. The masses in the disaster areas said it well: "In the old society, no one cared about disasters. Now, when disasters occur, there is no worry about food or clothing. We have rice and flour to survive the famine. If it weren't for the Communist Party, we would be selling our sons and daughters and selling our fields!"

    Guarantee the Grain Supply in Disaster Areas

    The urgent task of disaster relief is to ensure that disaster victims have food to eat. At the beginning of the founding of the country, grain funds were limited, and we could only ensure that disaster victims had grain mixed with substitutes to eat. In recent years, there has been more grain, and transportation has become more convenient. In particular, with the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sales, the state has been able to ensure that disaster areas receive a more normal grain supply. Although it is still necessary to save and survive the famine, it is much different than before. Take 1956 as an example, more than 7 billion jin of grain was transferred from various provinces across the country to seven heavily disaster-stricken provinces. If these grains were transported by large trucks with a load of three tons, more than 1.31 million large trucks would be needed, and they would need to be arranged in a line 13,100 kilometers long, which is equivalent to three round trips from Beijing to Guangzhou. Last year, 3.68 billion jin of grain was transferred to Hebei Province, the province with the most severe disaster. There are 15 million disaster victims in Hebei Province. The transferred grain, calculated at 245 jin per person, is enough for all disaster victims in the province to eat for one year. Of course, the transferred grain was not all evenly distributed to the disaster victims, and the disaster victims still had other sideline income. Therefore, although they suffered a major disaster, the lives of the disaster victims were still relatively stable. If the state had not implemented the policy of unified purchase and sales, it would have been difficult to uniformly allocate so much grain to the disaster areas. At the same time, it would not have been possible to ensure that there was no shortage of grain supply in the disaster areas and that grain prices did not rise at all.

    Establish Institutions to Conduct In-Depth Disaster Investigation

    In order to coordinate and arrange various disaster relief matters, the central government and the governments at all levels in the disaster areas have established production and disaster relief committees and offices with the participation of relevant departments, and have formulated comprehensive plans for production and disaster relief at all levels, so that all links in production and disaster relief can be effectively coordinated and carried out in an orderly manner. In order to grasp the disaster situation in a timely manner and solve the existing problems in the disaster areas, the relevant areas have stipulated a system of reporting disasters from the bottom up and investigating disasters from the top down. The State Council and the relevant ministries and commissions have repeatedly sent senior responsible cadres to visit various places and provide on-site guidance. The provincial party secretaries and governors of the disaster-stricken provinces have also continuously gone deep into the disaster areas for inspection. As for the number of responsible cadres at the prefecture and county levels who went to the countryside to investigate disasters, there were even more. During the rain and snow period last year, Henan Province sent more than 50,000 cadres at all levels to investigate disasters. Many disaster areas implemented a layer-by-layer contract responsibility system of "county cadres contracting townships, township cadres contracting communities, and community cadres contracting households." These cadres were stationed in the disaster areas for a long time, eating, living, and working with the disaster victims, offering ideas, finding solutions, and spending the disaster with the masses until the harvest came down before returning to the offices. Many cadres responsible for disaster relief work, such as Comrade Yang Dehua, the former director of the Civil Affairs Department of Guangxi Province, have always been concerned about the suffering of disaster victims and have waged a resolute struggle against bureaucracy that disregards the lives of the people. There are many such comrades and they deserve to be praised. Due to the serious responsibility of cadres at all levels for disaster relief and the continuous strengthening of leadership and inspection, it is generally possible to achieve: rapid reflection of the situation, timely resolution of problems, and ensuring the smooth progress of various tasks in the disaster areas.

    Shortcomings in Disaster Relief Work

    The achievements in production and disaster relief are endless. We should give sufficient estimation to the historic victory in the struggle against disasters, and the unlimited efforts of cadres and people. The bourgeois rightists say that "the People's Government is ineffective in disaster relief" and that there are more shortcomings than achievements, which is not in line with the facts. It should be seen that: after the land reform and agricultural production cooperation, the change in production relations; the government, the people, and the army stood on the same front to fight against disasters; the whole country unanimously supported the disaster areas, "whatever is needed is available"; is the source of disaster relief strength. Otherwise, one cannot understand why unprecedented victories can be achieved.

    The achievements in disaster relief work are great, but there are still many shortcomings, some of which are particularly serious. The battlefield of disaster relief is very wide, and there are often phenomena such as forgetting there for here, attaching importance to heavily disaster-stricken areas and neglecting lightly disaster-stricken areas, attaching importance to central areas and neglecting marginal mountainous areas. Disaster relief work requires the cooperation of many work departments, and sometimes the cooperation is not enough, such as when the money arrives, the grain does not arrive; when distributing relief funds, it is not completely fair and reasonable. This requires vigorous inspection and timely correction, otherwise it will cause undue damage to the disaster victims. Individual local leaders have serious bureaucracy and do not care about the people's lives. For example, in the spring of 1956, a major event of starvation deaths occurred in Guangxi Province. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have respectively given severe punishments to the relevant responsible personnel. As the person responsible for the specific work of disaster relief nationwide, I am responsible for failing to detect it in advance and suggesting that the leadership stop it in time.

    Strive to Fundamentally Eliminate Disasters

    Our country has a vast area, and disasters may occur every year. Under the current conditions, we can reduce disasters with human power, but we cannot eliminate disasters; fighting against disasters is still a long-term and arduous task. The "National Agricultural Development Program" (Draft) has pointed out the direction of efforts to fundamentally eliminate disasters for us. The program stipulates: Starting from 1956, ordinary floods, droughts, and the most serious insect pests and diseases that endanger crops will be basically eliminated within seven to twelve years. We should make persistent efforts and strive to gradually realize this great call of the central government. First of all, we must adopt various effective measures to transform nature and transform the land, such as planting trees and afforestation, building water conservancy, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and appropriately reforming the farming system. Anhui Province promoted "three reforms" in the farming system (that is, changing the proportion of seasonal harvests in northern Anhui, changing to planting high-yielding and water-resistant crops, and changing the habit of extensive planting and low harvest), increasing grain production by a total of 3.44 billion jin in 1955 and 1956; Tianjin Prefecture of Hebei Province implemented low-lying land transformation and changed planting. In 1956, 4.4 million mu of water-resistant, high-yielding, and early-maturing flood-avoiding crops were replanted in 58 low-lying depressions, harvesting more than 660 million jin of grain. These methods are all very good. Secondly, disaster-stricken areas should strengthen disaster relief and prevention institutions and formulate comprehensive and long-term disaster prevention plans. All localities should pay attention to disaster prevention work, especially disaster-stricken areas. The original disaster relief committees and offices in these areas should continue to be strengthened. Lead disaster relief when there is a disaster, and prepare for disaster prevention when there is no disaster. It is also necessary to formulate comprehensive and long-term disaster prevention plans based on the local natural conditions, terrain conditions, production conditions, and the historical occurrence and development of disasters, and to organize and step-by-step realize the requirements for eliminating disasters. Third, it is necessary to advocate agricultural cooperatives to store grain and prepare for famine. The "National Agricultural Development Program" (Draft) proposes: "Requiring all agricultural production cooperatives, in addition to the grain for their own consumption and to guarantee the needs of the country, to store enough surplus grain for one year, one and a half years, or two years of consumption, starting from 1956, within twelve years, according to the local conditions, in preparation for emergencies." Places with bumper harvests of summer and autumn crops this year should start to seriously study this issue, and after typical trials, call on qualified agricultural cooperatives to implement grain storage and famine preparation in accordance with the requirements of the program.

    We already have rich experience in disaster relief and prevention, and strong material and human resources for disaster relief and prevention. As long as we severely overcome the bureaucracy that is divorced from the people, we will definitely be able to defeat disasters and gradually eliminate disasters!

    我国救灾工作的伟大成绩
    ——驳斥右派分子说“人民政府救灾不力”的谰言
    内务部农村救济司司长　熊天荆
    近来资产阶级右派分子，从各方面向党的领导和社会主义制度，进行了猖狂的进攻。在救灾工作方面，他们同样以幸灾乐祸的态度，散布了许多谰言。说什么“人民政府救灾不力”，“灾区人民苦的不得了”，“群众处于死亡的边缘”等。我是负责具体救灾工作的，有必要把建国以来的救灾工作情况，和取得的伟大成绩，作一番简略介绍，帮助各界人民进一步认清资产阶级右派分子的毒辣阴谋。
    历史上灾后的悲惨景况
    我国历史上是一个多灾的国家，这不仅是由于我国长期处在反动阶级的统治下，社会生产力很低，农业经济很落后，人民不可能有充分控制自然灾害的能力，更重要的是历代统治阶级，特别是国民党反动派，不但不救灾，而且直接造灾。他们滥伐森林，破坏水利，使灾荒一代比一代增多，一次比一次严重；并且乘人民之危，横征暴敛，发灾荒财。因此，每当遇灾，便呈现出一副极为悲惨的景象。“赤地千里”、“十室九空”、“道殣相望”、“人食人肉”，是记载上常见的词句。我国人口的生育率虽然大，而过去人口的增长率却不很大，1835年即清道光15年，全国人口为四亿零一百七十六万，到国民党时代经过一百多年，仍只四亿五千万，其主要原因之一，就是常常有大量的人口死于灾荒。据“中国救荒史”记载：清嘉庆15、16年，道光26年、咸丰7年、光绪2、3、4、14年等八年的统计，死于灾荒的人口达六千五百七十八万人；国民党统治时期，自1920年到1936年中十六年的统计，死于灾荒的人口也达一千八百三十五万人。自然，记载并不是完全的。这些悲惨的历史，年青的人想像不到的历史，在中华人民共和国成立以后立即得到了扭转。建国八年来，受灾面积最多到二亿二千九百多万亩（1956年），最少有五千六百多万亩（1951年）；受灾人口最多到七千四百多万人（1956年），最少有二千七百多万人（1952年）。受灾最重的1954年，因灾死亡一万五千五百五十一人；1956年，因灾死亡一万零六百七十九人。其中绝大多数是在溃堤决口、山洪暴发或海潮袭击，来不及躲避的情况下淹死的；真正饿死的1954年仅四十四人，1956年也仅五百七十八人。这和旧社会灾后死亡几十万、几百万乃至几千万的情况，是不可同日而语的。
    党和政府对救灾工作的重要指示
    1949年中华人民共和国成立，面临着多年来帝国主义和反动统治阶级遗留下的残破不堪的局面，第一件事是如何战胜当前的特大灾荒。1949年12月政务院生产救灾指示说：“必须引起各级人民政府及人民团体高度的注意，认识到生产救灾是关系到几百万人的生死问题，是新民主主义政权在灾区巩固存在的问题，是开展明年大生产运动、建设新中国的关键问题之一，决不可对这个问题采取漠不关心的官僚主义态度。”1950年1月内务部生产救灾的补充指示说：“各级人民政府要对救灾负起高度的责任，不要饿死一个人！如有对灾情不了解，对春荒无准备，饥饿来临毫无办法，那就应受到责罚；反之则是人民的功臣，应受到奖励”。中央并明确提出救灾的方针是：“生产自救、节约度荒、群众互助，并辅以政府必要的救济”。几年来各级人民政府和广大的干部、群众坚决执行了这一方针，创造了一系列的有效办法和采取了各种有效行动，一次又一次地战胜了百年未有的水灾、五十年来未有的台风灾、几十年来未有的旱灾以及历史上少有的霜冻等严重灾害。不仅很少有饿死人的事，而且不论如何大的灾或连灾的地区，都能马上恢复生产，争取丰收，创造出了许多历史上从来没有过的奇迹！
    救灾工作的伟大成就
    灾来时的抢救工作
    为着改变自然面貌，增加抗灾力量，国家在根治河流、大型小型的水利工程上，水土保持、封山育林工程上，采取了许多伟大措施，而且已经或正在发挥效果。但是，由于我国的国土很大，自然条件又很复杂，解放以后短短几年的努力，还不可能完全控制自然灾害，因此，这几年仍有不同程度的灾荒发生。但灾是可以抵抗的。有灾发生，各级党政领导总是把抢救做为压倒一切的任务，动员上百万、上千万的干部、群众投入防汛、抢险、抗旱、防霜、捕虫的斗争，小灾可以完全消灭，大灾可以缩小损失。1954年江淮流域的洪水大于1931年，1931年武汉市曾被淹四个月，死人无数，而1954年武汉市水位比1931年决口时高出近三公尺，该市人民住在水的包围中，极为镇静和极有秩序地与洪水搏斗了三个月，水涨堤高，终于把洪水打退。这一年安徽、湖北等六个重灾省，把一千三百多万抢救出来的灾民，转移到非灾区，灾民到那里，干部到那里，供应也到那里。灾民可携带的财物没有损失，从转出到迁回，没有发生任何意外。有一位老先生说：不是我亲自视察，我几乎不能相信有这样的事，人民的力量真是伟大！1956年又是一个大水年，哈尔滨市松花江的水位高出市面二、三公尺，在全市人民英勇抗御下，也确保了该市的安全。这一年沿海各省又进行了抗御台风的斗争：上海市在得到警报后，极短的时间，做好了防御工作，使全市人民生命财产得到有效的保障，损失至微。江苏省数百里的海塘江堤，挡住了台风、海潮的冲击。此外，如大规模的抗旱，同样取得了伟大成绩。1952年春季，开展了全国性的防旱抗旱运动，修渠、打井，共扩大灌溉面积三千二百四十余万亩，对保证这一年的丰收起了极大的作用；去年湖南大旱，合作社组织社员车水翻山、越涧，终于使旱灾成为“插花灾”。再如大规模的防霜，1953、1954两年，虽然遭到历史上少见的大霜冻，但经过各省发动群众浇水救苗，终于挽回了收成。这类事迹，不胜枚举。在每次抢救灾害的斗争中，广大干部都奋不顾身，那里危险守在那里。为抗灾牺牲的干部，有县长、乡长、部队的连排长，及其他干部和积极分子，仅1954年保卫武汉市的斗争，就牺牲了一百零八位优秀的同志。上述这些伟大事迹，历史上是没有过的。
    成灾后的恢复工作
    成灾以后最重要的任务是恢复生产。我们抓住了这一点，口号是“生产救灾”。发展临时性的副业是治标，恢复并发展原有的农副业是治本。水灾、风灾后，堵口复堤、排水种麦、抢种晚秋、修盖房屋等；霜灾、旱灾后，抢救禾苗、加强田间管理、抢运种子、实行补种改种等。这些，常常要投入巨大的财力和人力，要有广泛的动员和细致的组织。1954年江淮流域遭到百年未有的大水，受灾各省，灾区与非灾区共同努力，利用各种办法争取多收粮食，湖北、安徽等五省共多收粮食七十九亿斤，对缓和灾情起了很大作用。加上副业生产，几个月后，1955年的春天，除了有一些住房还是棚子以外，已看不出受灾景况。这还是合作化以前的情况。合作化以后，人都组织起来，物资、工具和资金都集中起来，生产自救的力量更为增强了，灾区生产恢复的又快、又好。1956年河北省的水灾是最大了，但河北省种麦三千八百多万亩，超过了历史上最高的种麦面积。在这期间，河北、河南、黑龙江、吉林、湖南等五省统计，灾民的副业收入达四亿零八百多万元，可买粮食四十多亿斤。这就给灾区人民目前的和今后的生活以有力的保障。解放头几年，在我国经济力量还很薄弱的时候，是这样办，现在仍是这样办，这就使我们已不再重见历史上灾后的悲惨景象，而能有信心地战胜灾荒，用群众自己的力量创造出有吃有穿、安居乐业的生活。
    党和政府对灾区人民的高度关怀
    大力进行救济和扶持
    灾民度荒主要靠生产自救，对不能生产或生产不足自给的灾民，政府作了大力的救济和扶持。每年国家都拨出大批款项用于生产救灾。建国八年来国家发出的救济款共达十二亿九千余万元，其中1956年灾后到现在，拨给各灾区的救济款即达三亿七千余万元，加上用于防汛、抢险、堵口，及发放灾区的贷款，共达八亿六千万元。单只救济一项，按每人每月救济二点五元计算，即可维持二千四百六十多万人半年的生活。其中河北一省，即发放了救济款一亿一千零四十万元，受救济的灾民，在重灾区一般占40％，多的达70％，在轻灾区也占20％。仅去年冬季就救济了四百二十六万人。为了救济的公平合理，我们提倡“领导掌握与民主评议相结合”的原则。各地在执行这一原则中，创造了许多好的发放办法。如湖南、江苏的“一次评议、分期发放”，河北的“定工生产、定额救济”，许多地区的救济款、贷款、优抚款等结合发放的办法，都收到了良好的效果。特别是每当灾民处在危急的时候，广大农村干部，克服艰难困苦，亲自上门救济，使灾民转危为安。1954年江淮流域大水灾之后，继之以寒潮大雪，许多干部带领群众破冰、扫雪、架桥、开路，使灾区物资供应未因风雪而中断。而且背粮、携款、带衣逐户查访急救，使被风雪围困的灾民免于挨饿受冻。类似这样的情况很多，历史上那一个政府曾对灾区人民作过这样多的支持？没有过的。灾区群众说得好：“旧社会闹灾没人管，现在闹灾不愁吃、不愁穿，有米有面过荒年，如果不是共产党，卖儿卖女卖庄田！”
    保证灾区粮食供应
    救灾的迫切任务是保证灾民有吃的。开国之初，粮款有限，只能保证灾民有粮掺着代食品吃；近年粮食多了些，调运也便利了些，特别是实行了统购统销政策，国家已有把握保证灾区得到比较正常的粮食供应，虽然还要节约度荒，但比之以前已大大不同。拿1956年来说，从全国各省调入七个重灾省的粮食达七十多亿斤，这些粮食如果用载重三吨的大卡车来运，就需要一百三十一万多辆大卡车，需要摆成长达一万三千一百多公里的行列，这等于从北京到广州来回三趟之远。去年调往受灾最重的河北一省的粮食，即达三十六亿八千万斤。河北全省有灾民一千五百万人，调入的粮食按每人二百四十五斤计算，可够全省灾民吃一年。当然，调入的粮食不是全部平均分配给了灾民，而灾民尚有其他的副业收入，因而虽然遭了特大的灾，灾民生活还是相当安定的。如果不是国家实行了统购统销政策，要想把这么多粮食统一调配到灾区，是很难办到的。同时，要保证灾区粮食供应不缺，粮价一点不涨，也是不可能办到的。
    建立机构深入查灾
    中央和灾区各级政府，为了统筹安排各项救灾事宜，都成立了有有关部门参加的生产救灾委员会和办公室，层层制订了生产救灾的全面规划，使生产救灾的各个环节，都能有效配合，有条不紊地进行。为了及时掌握灾情，解决灾区存在的问题，有关地区都规定了自下而上的报灾和自上而下的查灾制度。国务院和有关各部，曾多次派高级负责干部亲赴各地视察和就地指导工作。受灾各省的省委书记、省长，更不断深入灾区检查。至于专、县负责干部下乡查灾的人数就更多了，河南省去年雨雪期间，派出查灾的各级干部达五万多人。许多灾区实行了“县干部包乡、乡干部包社、社干部包户”的层层包干负责制度，这些干部长驻灾区，与灾民同吃、同住、同劳动，出主意，想办法，与群众共度灾荒，不到收成下来不回机关。许多负责救灾工作的干部，如广西省前民政厅厅长杨德华同志，始终一贯的关心灾民的疾苦，曾向漠视民命的官僚主义作了坚决的斗争，这样的同志人数不少，是值得赞扬的。由于各级干部对救灾的认真负责，不断加强领导和检查，一般都能做到：情况反映迅速，问题解决及时，保证了灾区各项工作的顺利进行。
    救灾工作中的缺点
    生产救灾的成绩是说不完的。我们应该对同灾荒作斗争的历史性的胜利、干部和人民的无限努力，给以足够的估计。资产阶级右派分子说“人民政府救灾不力”，缺点多于成绩，是不符合事实的。应该看到：土地改革和农业生产合作化后，生产关系的改变；政府、人民、军队站在一条战线上向灾荒作战；全国一致支援灾区，“要什么有什么”；是救灾力量的来源。否则，不能了解为何能取得史无前例的胜利。
    救灾工作的成绩很大，但缺点仍是很多，有的且特别严重。救灾的战场很宽，常有为了这里，忘记那里；重视重灾区，忽视轻灾区；重视中心区，忽视边缘山区等现象。救灾工作需要许多工作部门配合，有时配合不够，如钱到了，粮没有到；发放救济款时，没做到完全公平合理。这就必须检查有力、纠正及时，否则就会给灾民以不应有的损害。个别地方领导干部官僚主义严重，不关心人民生活，如广西省在1956年春季发生饿死人的重大事件，中共中央和国务院已分别给予有关负责人员以严厉处分。我是负责全国救灾具体工作的，未能事先察觉，建议领导及时给以制止，是负有一定责任的。
    为基本消灭灾荒而斗争
    我国地区广大，每年都可能有灾荒发生。在目前条件下，我们可以用人力减少灾荒，但尚不能消灭灾荒；和灾荒作斗争还是长期的、艰巨的任务。“全国农业发展纲要”（草案）已经为我们指出了基本消灭灾荒的努力方向，纲要规定：从1956年开始，在七年至十二年内基本上消灭普通的水灾、旱灾和危害农作物最严重的虫灾和病害。我们应当再接再厉，为逐步实现中央的这一伟大号召而斗争。首先，要因地制宜，采用各种有效措施，改造自然，改造土地，如植树造林、兴修水利、防治病虫害，以及适当的改革耕作制度等。安徽省在耕作制度上推行“三改”（即在淮北地区改变季节收成比重、改种高产耐水作物、改变广种薄收的习惯），1955、1956两年增产粮食共三十四亿四千万斤；河北省天津专区实行洼地改造、改种，1956年在五十八个洼淀里改种了四百四十多万亩耐水高产和早熟避涝作物，收获粮食六亿六千多万斤；这些办法，都是很好的。其次，连灾地区要加强救灾、防灾机构，制订全面的、长远的防灾规划。防灾工作，各地都要注意，连灾地区尤其要注意。这些地区原有的救灾委员会和办公室，应当继续加强，有灾领导救灾，无灾筹备防灾。还需针对当地的自然条件、地形条件、生产条件以及历年灾荒发生发展的情况，订出全面的、长远的防灾规划，有组织、有步骤地实现消灭灾荒的要求。再次，要提倡农业社储粮备荒。“全国农业发展纲要”（草案）提出：“要求一切农业生产合作社，除了自己食用的和保证国家需要的粮食以外，从1956年开始，在十二年内，按照各地情况，分别储积足够一年、一年半或者两年食用的余粮，以备紧急时候的需要。”今年夏、秋作物丰收的地方，应当开始认真研究这一问题，经过典型试办，号召有条件的农业社，根据纲要的要求，实行储粮备荒。
    我们已有丰富的救灾防灾经验，强大的救灾防灾的物力与人力，只要我们严厉地克服脱离人民的官僚主义，我们就一定能打败灾荒，并逐步消灭灾荒！
