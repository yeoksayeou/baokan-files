Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, July 25th. The large-scale Jilin Fertilizer Plant has been completed ahead of schedule, and the first set of equipment has been officially put into production. The main products of this fertilizer plant, synthetic ammonia (i.e., ammonia) and methanol, are all transformed from air, Songhua River water, and poor-quality coal.

The synthetic ammonia produced by the Jilin Fertilizer Plant is mainly used to produce nitric acid. Nitric acid and synthetic ammonia combined produce ammonium nitrate, which is the chemical fertilizer produced in large quantities by this factory. The production of synthetic ammonia, nitric acid, and ammonium nitrate is quite complex, passing through nine workshops to form a complete production system. The factory's other main product, methanol, has not yet begun production.

The Jilin Fertilizer Plant is very large in scale. According to its designed capacity, its annual production of chemical fertilizers is almost equal to half of the national chemical fertilizer output in 1952. Starting next year, the factory will be expanded, and its output can be increased four or five times.

The Jilin Fertilizer Plant was built with the full and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The factory officially started construction in the first half of 1955 and was originally planned to be completed and produce products next year. After the high tide of agricultural cooperation in the country appeared, in order to meet the needs of agricultural technological transformation, the factory took steps to accelerate construction, thus completing it ahead of schedule and putting the first set of equipment into production as soon as possible. It is expected that all the factory's equipment will be put into production in September and October. Before this, the factory had processed a batch of chemical fertilizers using synthetic ammonia from other factories.

The completion of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant is of great significance for establishing the foundation of China's chemical fertilizer industry. This factory is large in scale, has advanced production technology, and the chemical fertilizer ammonium nitrate it produces has a higher nitrogen content than the several chemical fertilizers currently used in large quantities in various regions, and nitrogen is an indispensable nutrient for crops. The synthetic ammonia and nitric acid produced by this factory are important raw materials for the chemical industry. In addition to producing chemical fertilizers, these raw materials can also produce many products such as plastics, paints, and dyes. From the long-term development of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant, after the factory is expanded, it will use these two products and some other products as raw materials to produce Kapron and other types of man-made fibers, increasing textile industry products.

The methanol produced by the Jilin Fertilizer Plant can provide important raw materials for the development of China's plastics industry. Methanol, when mixed with gasoline (or benzene) in proportion, can be used as a good fuel for automobiles and tractors. After the factory starts production, it will also train a large number of technical personnel for China to master modern chemical equipment.

### 吉林肥料厂提前建成  每年生产的化学肥料接近1952年全国产量的一半

    吉林肥料厂提前建成
    每年生产的化学肥料接近1952年全国产量的一半
    新华社吉林25日电　规模巨大的吉林肥料厂提前建成，第一套设备正式投入生产。这个肥料厂生产的主要产品合成氨（即阿母尼亚）和甲醇，都是从空气、松花江水和质量很坏的煤变化来的。
    吉林肥料厂生产的合成氨，主要是用来生产硝酸，硝酸和合成氨合起来生产的硝酸铵，就是这个工厂大量出产的化学肥料。合成氨、硝酸、硝酸铵的生产相当复杂，先后经过九个车间，构成一套完整的生产系统。这个厂的另一种主要产品甲醇，目前还没有开始生产。
    吉林肥料厂的规模很大，按照设计能力，它每年生产的化学肥料几乎等于1952年全国化学肥料产量的一半。从明年开始，这个工厂将进行扩建，产量还可增加四、五倍。
    吉林肥料厂是在苏联全面无私援助下建成的。工厂从1955年上半年正式动工兴建，原计划在明年建成并出产品。全国农业合作化高潮出现后，为适应农业技术改造的需要，这个工厂采取了加速建设的步骤，因而提前建成，并使第一套设备尽先投入生产。预计在9、10月间，这个厂的设备就能全部投入生产。在这以前，这个工厂曾用外厂的合成氨加工了一批化学肥料。
    吉林肥料厂的建成，对于建立我国化学肥料工业的基础有着重要意义。这个厂的规模巨大，生产技术先进，生产的化学肥料硝酸铵，比目前各地大量使用的几种化学肥料含的氮量都高，而氮是农作物不可缺少的养料。这个厂生产的合成氨和硝酸，是化学工业的重要原料。这些原料除能生产化学肥料以外，还可以生产塑料、油漆、染料等很多产品。从吉林肥料厂的远景发展来看，这个工厂在扩建后将用这两种产品和其他一些产品作原料，来生产卡普隆等一类的人造纤维，增加纺织工业产品。
    吉林肥料厂生产的甲醇，即可为我国发展塑料工业提供重要的原料。甲醇按比例和汽油（或者苯）掺合，可以当作很好的燃料，供应汽车和拖拉机使用。这个工厂开工生产后，还将为我国掌握现代化工设备培养大批技术人材。
