Xinhua News Agency, July 10th: The Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress continued its general debate this afternoon. Thirty-eight representatives spoke or submitted written statements at the meeting. They continued to expose and criticize the reactionary nature of the bourgeois rightists, tore off the various disguises of the rightists' anti-socialist remarks, and warned the rightists to turn back in time, honestly confess their crimes to the people, and correct their mistakes. Many representatives also emphasized that this anti-rightist struggle is an extremely profound education and test for people from all walks of life, especially intellectuals.

Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, was the first to speak today. He said that the Party and the government have always been uniting, educating, and trusting Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and other rightists. However, they used their political positions, work units, and party organizations to pursue their extreme individualistic ambitions, engage in conspiracies, slander the leaders of the Party and the government, sow discord between the Party and the people, and undermine the socialist system. Shen Junru said that our Democratic League and other democratic parties have passed resolutions to resolutely struggle against the rightists and to carry out rectification within the democratic parties. This is absolutely necessary. We must never allow the socialist cause to be harmed or the socialist system to be shaken. He hoped that the members of the Democratic League and the intellectuals they are connected with will first draw a clear political and ideological line with the bourgeois rightists, stand firm on their socialist position, bravely plunge into the fiery struggle against the rightists, overcome sentimentalism, and carry the battle through to the end.

Wang Kunlun, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), said that the rampant attacks of the rightists have seriously reminded the democratic parties, making the RCCK, like other democratic parties, undergo another severe test in this great storm. He said that the democratic parties must first examine whether they truly accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Without the leadership and supervision of the Communist Party, the democratic parties cannot guarantee the correctness of their political line and course of action.

Xu Simin, Deputy Chairman of the New Rangoon News Agency, who just returned from overseas, said that the right-wing ambitious people took the opportunity of the People's Government widely opening up avenues of speech to spread fallacies that violate the wishes of the people of the whole country, including overseas Chinese. These fallacies are painful to relatives and gladdening to enemies, and patriotic overseas Chinese cannot agree to them at all. We overseas Chinese in Burma resolutely support the people of the motherland in refuting these malicious remarks with a solemn attitude and clarifying right and wrong.

Hu Yuzhi, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, exposed and criticized the criminal conspiracy of the Zhang Bojun-Luo Longji alliance against the Communist Party and socialism. He believes that it is incorrect to say that the Zhang-Luo alliance took completely blind action due to a momentary impulse. In fact, the conspiracy group headed by Zhang and Luo not only had a clear political program, but also had strategies, tactics, policies, and steps. It used a section of unremolded intellectuals to spread the poison of absolute democracy and individual liberalism, inciting them to be dissatisfied with the Party, so that when the time came, a Hungarian event could be created in China. Hu Yuzhi said that intellectuals should learn a lesson from this incident. Only by resolutely taking the socialist road and truly accepting the leadership of the Communist Party is there a bright future. If they leave the leadership of the Party, they will lose their way and eventually fall into the quagmire of the bourgeois rightists.

Army representative Zhang Ming made a joint speech on behalf of Ding Zhihui, Wang Zhaocai, Wang Yougen, Wang Weifu, Jiang Xueshan, Song Zhongfu, Zhou Wenjiang, Ma Chunyu, Cui Jiangong, Zhang Yingcai, Guo Enzhi, Lu Changrong, Huang Chouhe, Yang Zaixian, Zhao Maochen, Zhao Renhu, Liu Zilin, Liu Meicun and other nineteen people. He said that the many reactionary remarks spread by the rightists and their criminal activities against the Party, the people, and socialism have aroused the boundless anger of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Zhang Ming said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will always be the guardians of socialism. If anyone dares to undermine the sacred socialist cause, they will, together with the people of the whole country and under the leadership of the Party, thoroughly defeat it. Zhang Ming's speech constantly aroused stormy applause throughout the hall.

In Weichen, a national model agricultural laborer, warned the rightists, "Our peasants and the Communist Party will always be of one heart and one mind, taking the broad road of socialism." In Weichen recounted the development of the Huangtugang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beijing in recent years.

Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that the rightists vainly attempted to ignite fires among the workers and peasants, inciting the workers and peasants to be dissatisfied with the Party and the government. Their calculations were wrong. The workers and peasants have a long-term, flesh-and-blood intimate relationship with the Communist Party. No amount of discord can separate them. The broad masses of workers are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party, implementing the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift, and launching the movement for increasing production and practicing economy and the movement of advanced producers to build our motherland into a great socialist country.

Tang Shengzhi, Vice-Governor of Hunan Province, exposed the situation in Hunan where rightists echoed each other from top to bottom, lighting fires and fanning the flames everywhere. He said that this anti-rightist struggle is related to the future of our motherland and the future of the people. Every supporter of socialism should actively participate in this struggle.

Xia Kangnong, Vice-President of the Southwest Nationalities Institute, analyzed the various disguises of the rightists' anti-socialist remarks. He said that the nature of the rightists' crimes is serious, and the disguise of their thoughts and remarks is also vicious and sinister. Among them, several articles published under the name of Fei Xiaotong left behind entire, coherent confessions reflecting the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Ma Wanshui, Director of the Longyan Iron Mine Engineering Company, said that whether from the production situation of the Longyan Iron Mine or the lives of the workers, the comparison between after liberation and before liberation is truly like heaven and earth. He refuted the rightist remarks and hoped that the rightists would turn back in time and honestly correct their mistakes.

Liu Peizhi, Director of the Heilongjiang Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that some members of the China National Democratic Construction Association and industrialists and businessmen in Heilongjiang Province have not yet freed themselves from the influence of the rightists. They must be educated to recognize the true face of the rightists, correct their ideological errors, and faithfully accept socialist transformation.

Fu Jingwen, a model industrial worker in Wuhan, exposed the fact that the rightist Ma Zhemin in Hubei Province launched a mad attack on the Communist Party, and exposed Ma Zhemin's false self-criticism made at the Hubei Provincial Representative Group meeting.

Eight representatives submitted written speeches this afternoon. Liang Xi, Minister of Forestry, writer Wang Tongzhao, and famous traditional Chinese medicine doctor Xiao Longyou, who were unable to attend the meeting due to illness, also made written speeches to the conference today. Pan Zinian, Deputy Director of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, refuted the various fallacies of the bourgeois rightists distorting and slandering Marxism-Leninism in a written speech. Huo Weide, Vice-Governor of Gansu Province, based on the situation in Gansu Province, explained that the lives of farmers have gradually improved in recent years, and exposed the rumors and slanders of the rightists that farmers are dissatisfied with the Communist Party. The written speeches of Yao Shunfu, Manager of Zhejiang Zhenen Silk Weaving Factory, and Zheng Bijiang, Principal of Jiangsu Hushu Pass Sericulture School, respectively criticized and suggested on the slow development of China's silk industry. Wang Shiying, Governor of Shanxi Province, spoke about water conservancy construction related to agricultural production increase in Shanxi Province.

The executive chairmen of today's meeting were: Li Weihan, Wang Weizhou, Yang Mingxuan, Zhou Shutao, Long Yun, Ba Jin, Deng Fangzhi, and Xiraojiacuo.

The afternoon meeting started at three o'clock and ended at seven o'clock.

    在反右派的风浪里经受严重的考验
    沈钧儒王昆仑胡愈之等代表谈反击右派的重大意义
    据新华社10日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天下午继续进行大会讨论。有三十八位代表在会上发言或书面发言。他们继续揭露和批判了资产阶级右派分子的反动面目，撕掉了右派分子反社会主义言论的各种伪装，警告右派分子必须及早回头，老老实实地向人民认罪，改正错误。许多代表还强调指出，这次反右派的斗争，对于各界人民，特别是知识分子，是一次极其深刻的教育和考验。
    中国民主同盟主席沈钧儒今天第一个发言。他说，党和政府对章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器以及其他右派分子，一直是在团结他们、教育他们、信任他们的。但是他们却利用了自己的政治地位、工作机关和党派组织，来发挥他们的极端个人主义的野心，进行阴谋活动，诋毁党和政府的领导人，挑拨党和人民之间的团结，破坏社会主义制度。沈钧儒说，我们民盟和各民主党派已经通过决议，向右派分子进行坚决的斗争，并且在民主党派内部进行整风。这是完全必要的。我们决不能让社会主义事业受到损害，社会主义制度受到动摇。他希望民主同盟的成员和它们所联系的知识分子，首先同资产阶级右派分子认真划清政治和思想界线，站稳自己的社会主义立场，勇敢地投入反对右派的火热斗争中，克服温情主义，把战斗进行到底。
    民革中央宣传部长王昆仑说，这次右派分子的猖狂进攻，严重的提醒了各民主党派，使民革和各民主党派一样，在这次大风浪中，又经受了一次严重的考验。他说，民主党派首先要检验它是否真正接受共产党的领导，没有共产党的领导和监督，民主党派就不能保证政治路线和行动方向的正确。
    刚从海外回来的新仰光报社副董事长徐四民说，右派野心家借人民政府广开言路的机会，散布违反全国人民包括海外华侨心愿的谬论，这些谬论是为亲者痛、仇者快，国外爱国华侨是绝对不能同意的。我们缅甸华侨坚决拥护祖国人民以严正态度，对这些恶毒言论严加驳斥，辨明是非。
    中国民主同盟中央秘书长胡愈之揭露和批判了章伯钧、罗隆基联盟反共反社会主义的罪恶阴谋。他认为，那种说章罗联盟只是由于一时冲动，而采取了完全盲目的行动的说法，是不对的。事实上，以章罗为首的阴谋集团，不仅有明确的政治纲领，而且有战略战术，方针步骤。它利用一部分未经改造的知识分子，散播绝对民主和个人自由主义的毒素，鼓动他们对党不满，以便于时机到来的时候，在中国造成一次匈牙利事件。胡愈之说，知识分子，应该从这一事件中接受教训，只有坚决地走社会主义道路，真正接受共产党领导才是唯一的光明大路，要是离开了党的领导，就会迷失方向，最后陷入资产阶级右派的泥坑中。
    部队代表张明代表丁志辉、王兆才、王有根、王维福、江雪山、宋忠福、周文江、马春雨、崔建功、张英才、郭恩志、陆昌荣、黄丑和、杨在先、赵毛臣、赵仁虎、刘子林、刘梅村等十九人作了联合发言。他说，右派分子所散布的许多反动的言论和他们所进行的反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶活动，已经激起了人民解放军广大官兵无比的愤怒。张明说，中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军永远是社会主义的卫士，如果有人胆敢破坏神圣的社会主义事业，他们将同全国人民一道在党的领导下，彻底地打垮它。张明代表的发言不断地激起全场暴风雨般的掌声。
    全国农业劳动模范殷维臣警告右派分子说，“我们农民和共产党永远一条心，走社会主义这条平川大道。”殷维臣讲述了他所在的北京市黄土岗农业生产合作社几年来的发展。
    中华全国总工会副主席朱学范说，右派分子妄想在工农群众中点火，煽动工农群众对党和政府的不满，他们的算盘打错了。工农群众同共产党有着长期的血肉般的亲密关系，任何挑拨离间都不能把他们分离开的。广大的工人群众从他们自己的切身生活经验中知道，“我们工人和共产党是一条命一条心”。现在全国职工热烈响应党的号召，贯彻勤俭建国的方针，开展增产节约运动和先进生产者运动，要把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
    湖南省副省长唐生智揭露了在湖南的右派分子上下呼应，到处点火扇风的情形。他说，这次反右派的斗争，关系着我们祖国的前途和人民的将来，每一个拥护社会主义者都应该积极投入这一斗争。
    西南民族学院副院长夏康农剖析了右派分子反社会主义言论的各种伪装。他说，右派分子们罪行的性质是严重的，他们思想、言论的伪装也是毒辣阴险的。其中，用费孝通的名字发表过的几篇文章，在反映章罗同盟反党、反社会主义活动方面，留下了整篇的、有连贯性的供状。
    龙烟铁矿工程公司主任马万水说，不论从龙烟铁矿的生产情况和工人生活来看，解放后和解放前比较，真是天上地下了。他驳斥了右派言论，希望右派分子及早回头，老老实实地改正错误。
    黑龙江工商联主任委员刘珮芝说，黑龙江省的民建成员和工商业者中间有一部分人还没有从右派分子的影响下解脱出来，必须教育他们认清右派分子的真面目，纠正思想错误，忠实地接受社会主义改造。
    武汉市工业劳动模范傅景文揭露了湖北省右派分子马哲民向共产党狂妄进攻的事实，揭穿了马哲民在湖北省代表小组会上所作的假检讨。
    今天下午书面发言的有八位代表。因病不能出席会议的林业部部长梁希、作家王统照、著名中医萧龙友，今天也向大会作了书面发言。中国科学院哲学社会科学部副主任潘梓年，在书面发言中驳斥了资产阶级右派分子歪曲和污蔑马克思列宁主义的各种谬论。甘肃省副省长霍维德根据甘肃省的情况，说明几年来农民的生活已经逐步得到改善，揭穿了右派分子所说的农民对共产党不满的造谣和诬蔑。浙江振恩丝织厂经理姚顺甫和江苏浒墅关蚕丝学校校长郑辟疆的书面发言，分别对我国蚕丝事业发展缓慢的现象提出了批评和建议。山西省省长王世英讲了与山西省农业增产有关的水利建设问题。
    今天大会执行主席是：李维汉、王维舟、杨明轩、周叔韬、龙云、巴金、邓芳芝、喜饶嘉错。
    下午的会议从三时开始，到七时结束。
