Reported by our newspaper: On July 11th, the People's Publishing House and the World Knowledge Publishing House held a symposium to expose and refute the anti-Party and anti-socialist malicious remarks of Zeng Yanxiu, the Deputy Director and Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the People's Publishing House, who is also a Communist Party member.

	He slandered that the Party has degenerated and become a sectarian group protecting vested interests, and that the masses are "full of grievances" against the Party.
	Song Jiaxiu, the leader of the editorial team of the People's Publishing House, said that Zeng Yanxiu is like Nagy of Hungary. His answer to the reporter of the People's Publishing House blackboard newspaper on June 2nd fully demonstrated his "Nagy" identity.
	In this question and answer session attacking the Party, he slandered that the Party's "contradiction with the broad masses is so deep"! "Grievances are rife, and the people are dissatisfied and angry with the ruling party." He even confused right and wrong, comparing our Party with the Kuomintang, which brought disaster to the country and the people. He said that the corruption of the Kuomintang was astonishing, but what about the Communist Party? "In the past eight years, a considerable number of party members have been infected with dirty and decadent things" and "want to control the regime." Therefore, "the Party and non-Party members are as far apart as 108,000 miles." At a symposium held by the World Knowledge Publishing House on May 30th, he bluntly said: "The Kuomintang seized power in 1927, and people shouted slogans to overthrow them during the 'September 18th' Incident. We have been in power for seven years now, and although no one has shouted slogans to overthrow us yet, many people dare to be angry but dare not speak out." He also said: After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, "the Kuomintang returned to Nanjing and Shanghai and engaged in their 'five sons climbing the ranks,' and their prestige declined in one or two months. Although our Party is not like the Kuomintang, similar signs have appeared in the seven or eight years since entering the city." He also used "mountain spring water is clear, but spring water is turbid when it leaves the mountain" to scold party members for being corrupt. He applauded the reactionary remarks of other rightists and supported their attacks on the Party.
	Huang Shimian, an editor of the geography group of the People's Publishing House, said that Zeng Yanxiu's reactionary remarks played a role in colluding with the rightists in society and attacking the Party from within and without. Zhang Zhonghui, deputy section chief of the proofreading section of the People's Publishing House and member of the China Democratic League, said that Zeng Yanxiu said that "the Party and non-Party members are as far apart as 108,000 miles." As a non-Party cadre, I don't feel that way. I think the Party still pays attention to contacting the masses in all aspects. Although there are shortcomings in the work, it cannot be said that way. Zeng Yanxiu also said that "the masses are full of grievances." I don't know what it is based on? In fact, since liberation, everyone's living standards have improved. May I ask who are those people who are "full of grievances"? Zhong Yuanfan, an editor of the economics group of the People's Publishing House, said that Zeng Yanxiu repeatedly talked about "conservatism" among party member cadres. The "conservatism" he said was not conservatism in work, but that the Communist Party wanted to "control the regime" and "deep down in their minds, they want to maintain their considerable status and identity," saying that "after more than ten years of party membership and a little culture, they will inevitably become a section chief." Zeng Yanxiu always regards the Communist Party as a handful of sectarian groups that protect vested interests, and regards it as a degenerate party. He confuses the nature of our party, the fundamental purpose of our party, and the reactionary Kuomintang. The fact is very clear, it is not that the Party has degenerated, but that Zeng Yanxiu himself has deteriorated ideologically and in life.
	Wang Jigeng, an editor of the World Knowledge Publishing House, said that Zeng's answers to reporters played two roles: First, it called on rightists to attack the Party, comparing the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which is equivalent to calling on rightists to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party. Second, to the party, it is calling on party members to betray the party.
	Wang Zhiming, Deputy Director of the Administrative Office of the People's Publishing House, Xing Xianting, Secretary of the Party Branch, and Wang Shuji, an editor, all exposed many facts to prove that Zeng Yanxiu's privileged thinking was serious. For example, he haggled over life and status, lost his temper and scolded cadres over trivial matters, and had to be urged three times and four times to pay party dues. When the party group leader notified him to attend party meetings, he often refused to participate. Deputy Director Zhou Baochang listed facts to prove that the Party branch of the People's Publishing House had done a lot of work and had achieved results. Of course, there were also shortcomings, but Zeng Yanxiu's claim that the branch had degenerated was completely malicious slander.
	Huang Shimian, an editor of the People's Publishing House, said that Chu Anping said "the Party's world," and Zeng said "controlling the regime," echoing each other, and there was no difference. Xing Xianting, secretary of the Party branch of the People's Publishing House, said that Zeng was a vanguard in attacking the Party, and was even worse than Chu Anping.

	He slandered the Central Propaganda Department, attempting to negate the great achievements of the publishing industry in the past eight years; he also advocated "cutting off" the Publishing Bureau and running "comrade publishing houses."
	Everyone also pointed out that Zeng Yanxiu disregarded the facts, slandered the leadership of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Culture over the publishing industry, and negated the great achievements of the publishing industry in the past eight years, saying that publishing work was even worse after the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique. Zeng Yanxiu said, "After liberation, until the policy of 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend' was put forward, I don't think there was any policy or leadership in publishing," "The Central Propaganda Department never gave positive instructions on what should be published." Zhao Xiaoen, director of the publishing department of the People's Publishing House, said, "I don't think Zeng Yanxiu's statement came from the mouth of the Deputy Director and Communist Party member of the People's Publishing House, a national political book publishing house. We cannot imagine how our work has been carried out in the past few years without a policy and without leadership? Is it completely laissez-faire and blindly carried out?" I don't know much about the overall publishing situation, but just taking the People's Publishing House as an example, just citing one fact proves that Zeng Yanxiu is talking nonsense. In 1954, the report of the Central Propaganda Department approved by the Party Central Committee made specific and clear instructions on the publishing policy and tasks of the People's Publishing House. We are working according to this instruction. Zeng Yanxiu came to our agency to work when this instruction came down. How could he have forgotten it? Why did he say there was no policy?" He listed the Marxist-Leninist classics and other academic works published in recent years, and forcefully refuted Zeng's rumors and slanders.
	Many comrades revealed that Zeng Yanxiu advocated abolishing the Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, which directly leads the national publishing work. He said: "Cutting off this bureau will not cause China to perish." At the same time, he also advocated running "comrade publishing houses." Many people said, aren't some rightists advocating weakening or even abolishing the state's leadership over publishing work? Isn't this colluding from within and without? Liang Chunfu, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the World Knowledge Publishing House, said that at the People's Daily symposium, Zeng Yanxiu echoed Lan Yuyi, Deputy Director of the Popular Reading Publishing House, and denied the achievements of the publishing industry in the past eight years, attempting to use this opportunity to provoke attacks and slanders against the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Culture in the publishing industry.
	Deng Bucheng, Deputy Director of the Planning and Finance Office of the People's Publishing House, pointed out that Zeng's advocacy of running comrade publishing houses is no different from the rightists' desire to run comrade news agencies and comrade newspapers. That is to restore capitalist freedom of the press and publication. This is the program he put forward after completely negating the Party's leadership.
	Zeng Yanxiu's anti-Soviet remarks were also criticized by everyone. Zhou Baochang, Deputy Director of the People's Publishing House, and other comrades revealed that Zeng Yanxiu opposed learning from Soviet experience in publishing work under the guise of opposing dogmatism, believing that publishing work had been messed up in the past because of learning from the Soviet Union.
	Zeng Yanxiu made a brief statement at the meeting, saying: "I have made mistakes, but I am not anti-Party or anti-socialist. Everyone says that today, it seems that I am the worst person. I should consider it again." Everyone was very dissatisfied with his attitude of refusing to criticize and not explaining his review.

### 党内也有右派分子  曾彦修蜕化变质了  人民出版社和世界知识出版社联合举行批判会

    党内也有右派分子
    曾彦修蜕化变质了
    人民出版社和世界知识出版社联合举行批判会
    本报讯　7月11日，人民出版社和世界知识出版社举行座谈会，揭露和驳斥身为共产党员的人民出版社副社长兼副总编辑的曾彦修的反党、反社会主义的恶毒言论。
    他污蔑党已经蜕化变质，沦为保护既得利益的宗派集团，群众对党“怨声载道”
    人民出版社编辑组长宋家修说，曾彦修有如匈牙利的纳吉，他6月2日答人民出版社黑板报记者问，就充分说明了他的“纳吉”身份。
    在这篇向党进攻的答记者问中，他污蔑党“原来和广大群众矛盾如此之深”！“怨声载道，人民对当权的政党不满而愤怒”。他甚至混淆黑白，拿我们的党和祸国殃民的国民党相提并论。他说国民党腐败惊人，而共产党呢？“八年来相当大的一部分党员，沾染了肮脏的腐朽的东西”，“要把持政权”。因而“党和非党相隔十万八千里”。他在5月30日世界知识出版社召开的座谈会上，露骨地说：“国民党1927年取得政权，‘九一八’时人民就喊打倒他们的口号，我们取得政权现在七年，虽然还没有人喊出打倒我们的口号，但已有许多人敢怒而不敢言”了。他又说：抗日战争“胜利后国民党回到南京、上海，大搞其‘五子登科’，一两个月就威信下降。我们党虽未像国民党，但入城七、八年来，已有类似迹象”。他又用“在山泉水清，出山泉水浊”来骂党员腐化了。他对其他右派分子的反动言论大声喝采，支持他们向党进攻。
    人民出版社地理组编辑黄世绵说，曾彦修的反动言论和社会上的右派分子起了里应外合，向党进攻的作用。人民出版社校对科副科长、民盟盟员张仲恢说，曾彦修说“党和非党相隔十万八千里”，我作为一个非党干部，体会并不是这样，我觉得党在各方面还是注意联系群众的，虽然工作中有缺点，但不能那么说。曾彦修还说什么“群众怨声载道”不知根据什么？事实上，解放以来，大家的生活水平都提高了，试问那些人“怨声载道”？人民出版社经济组编辑钟远藩说，曾彦修反复讲党员干部有“保守主义”，他说的“保守主义”并不是工作上的保守主义，而是说共产党要“把持政权”，“思想深处要保持自己相当地位和身份”，说什么“有十几年党龄和一点文化，少不了当一个科长”。曾彦修总是把共产党看成为一撮保护已得利益的宗派主义集团，看成为蜕化变质的党，他把我们党的性质、党的根本目的和反动透顶的国民党混为一谈了。事实很清楚，不是党蜕化了，倒是曾彦修本人在思想上和生活上变质蜕化了。
    世界知识出版社编辑王济庚说，曾的答记者问，起了两种作用：一、号召右派分子向党进攻，把国民党和共产党相提并论，等于号召右派来推翻共产党的领导。二、对党内说，是号召党员叛党。
    人民出版社行政处副处长王志明、党支部书记邢显庭、编辑王淑吉等纷纷揭发了许多事实，证明曾彦修的特权思想严重，例如计较生活、地位，小事情就发大脾气骂干部，而且交党费也要三催四催，党小组长通知他开党的会议，他常常不愿参加。副社长周保昌列举事实来证明人民出版社的党支部是做了许多工作，是有成绩的，当然也有缺点，但曾彦修说支部蜕化了，这完全是恶意的诽谤。
    人民出版社编辑黄士绵说，储安平说“党天下”，曾说“把持政权”，互相呼应，没有两样。人民出版社党支部书记邢显庭说，曾是向党进攻的急先锋，较储安平有过之无不及。
    他诽谤中央宣传部，企图否定出版事业八年来的巨大成就；还主张“砍掉”出版局，办“同人出版社”
    大家还指出了曾彦修无视事实，毁谤中共中央宣传部和文化部对出版事业的领导，和否定八年来出版事业的巨大成就，说出版工作在反胡风反革命集团斗争后更糟糕了。曾彦修说，“解放后，直到‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’的方针提出以前，我认为在出版方面是没有方针，没有领导的”，“中宣部从未正面指示出版方面应出些什么”。人民出版社出版部主任赵晓恩说，我认为曾彦修的这种说法，不像出诸于国家政治书籍出版社——人民出版社副社长、共产党员的口中。我们不能设想，如果没有方针，没有领导，这几年我们的工作是怎样进行的呢？是完全自流、盲目地进行的吗？我对全面出版的情况不了解，单就人民出版社来说，只要举一个事实，就证明曾彦修是胡说。1954年党中央批转中宣部的报告中，专对人民出版社的出版方针任务，作过既具体又明确的指示，我们是循着这个指示来进行工作的。这个指示下来时正是曾彦修来我社担任工作的时候，怎么会忘记了呢？为什么要说没有方针呢？他列举了几年来所出版的马列主义经典著作，和其他学术著作，有力地驳斥了曾的造谣毁谤。
    不少同志揭露，曾彦修主张取消直接领导国家出版工作的文化部出版局，他说：“把这个局砍掉，中国不会亡”。同时，又主张办“同人出版社”。许多人说，有些右派分子不是在主张削弱，甚至取消国家对出版工作的领导吗？这不是里应外合，又是什么呢？世界知识出版社副总编辑梁纯夫说，曾彦修在人民日报座谈会上与通俗读物出版社副社长蓝钰一呼一应，一口否定八年来出版事业的成绩，企图利用这个机会挑起出版界对中宣部和文化部的进攻和诽谤。
    人民出版社计划财务室副主任邓步城指出，曾主张办同人出版社，是和右派分子要办同人通讯社、同人报纸没有分别的，那就是恢复新闻出版的资本主义自由，这是他完全否定党的领导以后所提出的纲领。
    曾彦修的反苏言论也受到大家的批判。人民出版社副社长周保昌和其他同志的揭露，曾彦修在反对教条主义的幌子下，反对在出版工作上学习苏联经验，认为过去就是因为学习苏联把出版工作搞糟了。
    曾彦修在会上作了简单的发言，他说：“我有错误，但不是反党反社会主义。今天大家这样说，当然好像我就是最坏的人啦。我应当再三考虑”，大家对他这种拒绝批判，毫不交代检讨的态度，非常不满。
