Tolerance of Rightists is Inhumane to the People
Wu Yifang's Speech
I fully endorse and agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and other reports submitted to the congress by the central leading comrades. After listening to Premier Zhou's report, my thinking was greatly enlightened and educated. Now I will superficially express some personal experiences.

Premier Zhou's report, based on the principles put forward by Chairman Mao in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," comprehensively summarized the experiences and lessons of the people of the whole country in their work in 1956, and affirmed the great achievements in their work. Furthermore, it thoroughly clarified once again the basic system of our country, and gave a powerful and stern rebuttal to the various fallacies of the Rightists who did not want socialism and did not want the leadership of the Party, and who slandered the basic system of the country, fundamentally safeguarding the people's democratic dictatorship state led by the Communist Party, which is also to protect the interests of China's 600 million people. This report made us more clearly distinguish the most fundamental issues of right and wrong in national life, and recognize that the struggle with the Rightists is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. We intellectuals must unite with the workers, peasants, and working people of the whole country on the basis of socialism and resolutely defeat the rampant attacks of the bourgeois Rightists.

The Chinese people's choice to take the socialist road and have the leadership of the Communist Party is a historical conclusion made by the people of the whole country after a century of heroic struggle, and is stipulated in the solemn constitution. The facts after liberation have also proved that China can only take the socialist road. In these short eight years, the economic, political, cultural, educational, and ideological construction of our country has truly progressed by leaps and bounds. The unity of the people of the whole country in construction has given many international friends the deepest impression. Foreign friends who have visited our country, even those from capitalist countries hostile to us, believe that the brilliant achievements we have achieved in these years are a miracle and are amazed. Indeed, it cannot but be called a miracle to change from such an extremely poor and backward country to the brand-new look of prosperity we have today. But the so-called miracle has no secret. It precisely embodies the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. It is precisely the result of 600 million people truly becoming the masters of the country and giving play to their creative labor. It is precisely due to the correct leadership of the great and glorious Communist Party of China. Take education as an example, the achievements in the past eight years have also been enormous. At present, there are 227 institutions of higher learning in the country, with the number of students nearly quadrupling compared with the early days of liberation (1949); more than 6,700 secondary schools, with the number of students more than five times that of the early days of liberation; and more than 529,000 primary schools, with the number of students more than three times that of the early days of liberation. Not only has the quantity increased rapidly, but the quality of education has also been greatly improved through major measures such as educational reform. The spirit of the people's teachers, who are conscientious and responsible, and cultivate talents for socialist construction, is also very valuable. These achievements are incomparable to those before liberation. People still have fresh memories of the dilapidated state of education in old China. Could it be that the Rightists have such great ability to write off these achievements? Can they close their eyes and ignore the objective facts?

The Rightists also said that laymen cannot lead experts, and the Party cannot lead scientific and cultural undertakings. This absurd argument is also completely inconsistent with the facts. Leadership includes two aspects, one is the leadership of policies and principles, and the other is the leadership of professional technology, and the leadership of policies and principles is the main one. The Party has the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, the correct political line and organizational line, and rich experience in struggle and work. Therefore, the Party is not a layman in grasping policies and principles but an expert. As for the leadership of professional technology, the Party has always required Party members to learn things they do not understand, to study their professions, and to be familiar with technology, and the Party is also good at relying on the strength of the masses, and in fact it is capable of leading. The practice of the past eight years has proved that the Party has successfully led all work. The twelve-year science plan jointly formulated by hundreds of scientific experts would not have been possible without the leadership of the Communist Party. The so-called "laymen cannot lead experts" is just the ambition of the Rightists to conspire to usurp the leadership of the Party.

In this rectification movement, a small number of bourgeois Rightists, unwilling to see the elimination of their class, took the opportunity to launch a vicious attack on the socialist system and the leadership of the Party. These Rightists must be resolutely repelled, because if not, it will shake the foundation of our country. Now the struggle against the Rightists has begun to develop in depth, and the broad revolutionary intellectuals and members of democratic parties have actively engaged in this struggle. However, some people still regard the Rightists with a "good heart" and are even unwilling to wage a merciless struggle against them because they do not fully understand the harm of the Rightist fallacies and the seriousness of the struggle against the Rightists. This sentimental attitude is wrong, because it is actually forgiving the Rightists, loving individuals but not the masses. Tolerance of the Rightists is inhumane to the people. It is obviously extremely detrimental to socialist construction. We must fight to the end and never stop until complete victory.

The struggle against the Rightists is an acute class struggle on the political and ideological fronts. This struggle also tells us that intellectuals must strengthen self-remolding. After the great social changes in 1956, we basically completed the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, but for intellectuals who were educated by the bourgeoisie and deeply influenced by the bourgeoisie, our thinking still remains on the original basis, and we cannot quickly change the old habits under the private ownership system. Therefore, we must strive to transform our thinking, constantly study Marxism-Leninism, improve our socialist consciousness, and establish a proletarian world outlook. The process of this anti-Rightist struggle is precisely the process of self-remolding. This is the most practical and profound class education. We must use this struggle to temper ourselves and transform ourselves.

### 对右派分子宽容就是对人民不仁  吴贻芳的发言

    对右派分子宽容就是对人民不仁
    吴贻芳的发言
    我完全拥护和同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告及其他各位中央领导同志向大会提出的各项报告。我在听了周总理的报告后，思想上得到了很大的启发和教育。现在我很肤浅的说一些个人的体会。
    周总理的报告，依据毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲演所提出的方针，全面地总结了全国人民在一九五六年工作中的经验教训，肯定了工作中的伟大成绩。并且再一次透彻地阐明了我们国家的基本制度，对右派分子不要社会主义和不要党的领导，诋毁国家基本制度的种种谬论，给予了有力的、严正的驳斥，从根本上维护了共产党领导的人民民主专政的国家，也就是保卫了我国六亿人民的利益。这一报告，使我们更清楚地明辨了国家生活中最根本的是非问题，认清了同右派的斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。我们知识分子要和全国工农劳动人民一起，在社会主义的基础上团结起来，坚决打垮资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻。
    中国人民要走社会主义道路和要共产党的领导，这是全国人民经过百年来英勇奋斗所作出的历史结论，在庄严的宪法上早有规定。解放后的事实也证明中国只有走社会主义的道路。这短短的八年中，我国人民在经济、政治、文教、思想各方面的建设真是一日千里，飞速进展。全国人民团结一致地从事建设，给了许多国际友人最深刻的印象。访问过我国的外国朋友，甚至连敌视我们的资本主义国家里来的人，也认为这几年我们获得的辉煌成就是一种奇迹，都感到惊异。的确，从我们这样极端贫困落后的大国，改变到今天这样欣欣向荣的崭新面貌，不能不说是一种奇迹。但所谓奇迹，并没有什么秘诀。而正是体现了社会主义制度的无比优越性。正是由六亿人民真正做了国家的主人，发挥了创造性劳动的结果。正是由于伟大的、光荣的中国共产党正确领导的结果。就拿教育事业来说，这八年来的成就也是巨大的。现在全国有高等学校二百二十七所，学生较解放初（一九四九年）发展到将近四倍；中等学校六千七百多所，学生较解放初发展到五倍以上；小学校五十二万九千多所，学生较解放初发展到三倍以上。不但数量上增长迅速，而且通过教育改革等重大措施，教育的质量也有很大提高。现在人民教师那种认真负责，为社会主义建设培养人材的精神也是很可贵的。这些成就与解放前是不可比拟的。旧中国教育事业那种破破烂烂的局面，人们还记忆犹新。难道右派分子竟有这么大的本领把这些成绩一笔勾销吗？难道能闭着眼睛不看客观存在的事实吗？
    右派分子还说：外行不能领导内行，党不能领导科学文教事业。这种荒谬论调也是完全不符合事实的。领导包括两个方面，一方面是政策方针的领导，一方面是业务技术上的领导，而政策方针的领导则是主要的，党有马克思列宁主义的思想武器，有正确的政治路线和组织路线，有丰富斗争经验和工作经验。所以党在掌握政策方针上并不是外行而是内行。至于业务技术上的领导，党也一向要求党员学会自己不懂的东西，要他们钻研业务、熟悉技术，而且党还善于依靠群众的力量，事实上也是能够领导的。过去八年的实践证明，党已经成功地领导了一切工作。几百位科学专家共同制定的十二年科学规划，要不是共产党领导，是不可能的。所谓“外行不能领导内行”的说法，只不过是右派分子阴谋篡夺党的领导的野心罢了。
    在这次整风运动中，少数资产阶级的右派分子不甘心他们本阶级的被消灭，乘机向社会主义制度和党的领导展开了恶毒的进攻，对于这些右派分子，必须加以坚决的回击，因为不这样，就会动摇我们国家的根基。现在反右派斗争已开始深入发展了，广大的革命知识分子和民主党派的成员已积极的投入了这场斗争。但是，有一些人由于对右派谬论的危害性和反右派斗争的严重性还认识不足，因而还以“好心肠”来看待右派分子，更不愿意对他们进行无情的斗争。这种温情主义的态度是错误的，因为这实际上就是原谅右派分子，是怜个人而不爱大众。对右派分子的宽容就是对人民的不仁。显然是极不利于社会主义建设的。我们必须斗争到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    反右派斗争是政治战线上、思想战线上的激烈的阶级斗争。这一斗争也告诉我们，知识分子必须加强自我改造。在一九五六年社会大变革后，我们基本上完成了实行生产资料公有制的社会主义改造，但对于受资产阶级教育和受资产阶级影响较深的知识分子来说，我们的思想还停留在原有的基础上，还不能很快改变私有制度下的老习惯。因此我们要努力改造自己的思想，不断地学习马克思列宁主义，来提高社会主义觉悟，树立无产阶级的世界观。而这次反右派斗争的过程，正是自我改造的过程，这是一次最实际的深刻的阶级教育，我们要通过这一场斗争来锻炼自己，改造自己。
