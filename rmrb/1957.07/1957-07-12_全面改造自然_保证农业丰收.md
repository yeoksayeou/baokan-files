Comprehensive Transformation of Nature to Guarantee Agricultural Abundance

Resolutely and vigorously fighting against water, making every effort to utilize and control water, is not only a fundamental measure to change the backward state of agricultural production in Shanxi but also an unshirkable task for the people of Shanxi to support neighboring provinces in overcoming natural disasters and to cooperate with the comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River and Hai River projects.

Wang Shiying's Speech

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of other responsible comrades. The facts in the reports powerfully prove that in the past year, our country has achieved great achievements in socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of the bourgeois right-wing elements have been shattered in the face of ironclad facts. Through the victorious struggle against the right-wing, the people of all strata throughout the country have become more clearly aware and more consolidated in their unity. We believe that on the basis of the unity of the people of all strata and nationalities throughout the country, we will further promote the continuous victorious advancement of our country's great socialist construction. Many people have spoken about refuting the right-wing elements' remarks, and I fully agree with and support them, so I will not repeat them. I would like to talk about the issue of water conservancy construction related to agricultural production increase in our province, in order to obtain strong support and assistance from all parties.

Shanxi's agricultural production, like that of other parts of the country, has greatly developed in recent years under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. Especially after the realization of advanced agricultural cooperatives, the speed of development has become more significant. For example, although 11.9 million mu of cultivated land in the province suffered serious natural disasters in 1956, the total grain output still exceeded the highest historical annual output, reaching 8.67 billion jin. The result of the development of agricultural production has been a considerable improvement in the lives of the broad masses of urban and rural people and a significant increase in rural purchasing power; at the same time, it has powerfully supported the development of national industrial construction and cultural education. However, it should also be noted that the speed of agricultural development in Shanxi Province still lags far behind the needs of national construction and people's lives. From 1952 to 1956, the grain yield per unit area in the province has been hovering around 130 jin, and the total output has been fluctuating between 7.6 billion jin and 8.6 billion jin. This slow rate of development is very inconsistent with the rapid development of industrial construction and the rapid increase of urban and rural population in Shanxi Province. Now, it is felt that there is an annual shortage of grain, and the development of economic crops is also affected. If this situation is not changed quickly, the difficulties encountered in the future can be foreseen. We must try every means to change this situation and believe that on the basis of the province's realization of advanced agricultural cooperativization and the unity of the people of the whole province, we will certainly be able to change this situation.

Why can't agricultural production in Shanxi Province develop rapidly? This is mainly due to the limitation of natural conditions. Shanxi is greatly affected by natural disasters such as spring drought, autumn flooding, mountain floods, hail, and saline-alkali soil every year. At the same time, we have not grasped the fundamental work of how to control and utilize water tightly enough in our leadership, and we have not done enough. Why do I say this?

First, Shanxi has a high terrain and a dry climate. The annual rainfall is only about 400 millimeters, while the annual evaporation is over 1,000 millimeters; at the same time, the distribution of rainfall is extremely uneven, mostly concentrated in July, August, and September. During this period, rainfall accounts for about 60% of the total annual rainfall, thus forming a phenomenon where nine out of ten years are drought-stricken, and spring drought and autumn flooding cannot guarantee planting and harvesting. The threat of drought exists almost every year. In the seven years since liberation, the area of cultivated land affected by drought each year has been about 5 million mu. The most serious was in 1955, when the total rainfall from May to August was only 73.4 millimeters, causing 56 counties and cities to suffer from drought (there are a total of 100 counties and cities in the province), with a total of 20.18 million mu of cultivated land affected by the disaster. Despite emergency relief, grain production was still reduced by 1.7 billion jin, and the affected population reached more than 3.14 million people.

Second, the total area of land suitable for forestry, animal husbandry, and cultivation in the province is 224.5 million mu, and the mountainous area accounts for 175.8 million mu, accounting for 75% of the total area of the province. Most of these areas lack forest and pasture cover, and the sand and gravel are exposed. Therefore, without rain, it is extremely dry, and with rain, mountain floods break out, and a large amount of soil and water is lost. According to investigations and estimates, the area of serious soil erosion reaches 160 million mu, and the amount of silt lost each year is as high as 300 million tons (one system flows into the Hai River through the Sanggan River, Hutuo River, and Zhang River through the Hebei Plain; the other system flows into the Yellow River through the Fen River and Qin River through the central and southern basins of Shanxi, and the amount of silt loss is estimated to account for about half each), which is equivalent to the loss of 37,600 jin of fertile topsoil from each mu of cultivated land in the mountainous areas of Shanxi every year (about equal to more than one inch thick of cultivated land topsoil). As a result, the soil fertility of cultivated land in the vast Loess Plateau area is decreasing year by year. In addition, these areas are sparsely populated, the cultivation is extensive, there is little fertilizer, and there is insufficient rainfall. Therefore, the yield per unit area has long remained at an average level of 40 to 60 jin per mu and cannot be improved, and sometimes even nothing is harvested. Such serious soil erosion not only seriously endangers agricultural production in Shanxi but also poses a great hazard to agricultural production in neighboring provinces such as the Hebei Plain and northern Henan; at the same time, it has a very serious impact on the extension of the life of the Guanting Reservoir. If this continues, it will also be a great threat to the life of the Sanmenxia Reservoir. If we can concentrate our efforts and carry out treatment early, turning water harm into water conservancy, it will save and produce great wealth for the country every year.

Third, Shanxi is the source of several major rivers in North China. Due to the large bare mountains and unpredictable climate changes, there are frequent rainstorms and hail disasters. Also, because the mountains are steep, the rivers are narrow and the slopes are steep, and the sources are short and the flows are rapid, mountain floods break out and cause disasters when it rains heavily. In the past seven years, an average of more than 1,200 villages and towns and more than 1.2 million mu of cultivated land have been flooded each year. The most serious were in 1954 and 1956. In 1954, a total of 4.49 million mu of crops were flooded, more than 200,000 houses collapsed, 419 people died, and more than 37,800 large and small livestock died; in 1956, 3.04 million mu of crops were flooded, more than 170,000 houses collapsed, 750 people died, 986 people were injured, more than 16,000 large and small livestock died, and 7,041 irrigation, flood control, and transportation bridge projects were destroyed. At the same time, destructive disasters occurred in Wangli Village in Pingding County, Chedan Village in Pingshun County, and Shiziping in Fanshi County, where the entire villages were submerged due to mountain collapses and landslides. A total of 539 houses were submerged in the three small villages, 237 people died, and other property was completely lost. This situation, especially in the upper and middle reaches of each river system, seriously damages agricultural production in mountainous and riverside areas, and causes greater flood disasters to neighboring provinces such as Hebei and Henan in the lower reaches. It is understood that the extent of the floods suffered by Hebei Province in the past two years is even more serious than that of Shanxi. According to the disaster statistics of 1956 alone, a total of 45 million mu of crops were flooded, more than 2.6 million houses collapsed, and more than 15 million people were affected by the disaster (including 9 million people in severely affected areas), resulting in a reduction of 5 billion jin of grain and more than 300 million jin of cotton. If the reduction in production due to disasters and all the losses suffered, as well as the relief grain funds allocated by the state each year, are added together, the amount is quite alarming. If we can concentrate our efforts and carry out treatment early, turning water harm into water conservancy, it will save and produce great wealth for the country every year.

Fourth, Shanxi's topography is surrounded by mountains and low-lying in the middle, forming several large basins. These areas are the essence of our province, but due to the lack of proper and qualified irrigation, water storage, and drainage systems, some areas have also adopted the method of flood irrigation, which has caused the groundwater level to rise year by year, causing a large number of land to become marshy and salinized. At present, the province has about 800,000 mu of marshland and 1.6 million mu of saline land, of which 1.2 million mu have been completely abandoned. This trend is still continuing in the Jinan, Jinzhong, Xinding Basins, and Yanbei Basins, and the situation is very serious. For example, Beihezong Village in Ying County, Yanbei, used to be the essence of the county, known as the granary. There were more than 10,000 mu of good land, with orchards and vegetable gardens everywhere, and the people's lives were very prosperous. However, since 1948, the groundwater level has continued to rise, and the land has gradually become alkaline. Now, only 5,000 mu of land is left that can be barely planted, and the rest have been alkalized and abandoned. The orchards and vegetable gardens no longer exist, production has declined year by year, and the people's lives have become increasingly impoverished. In 1949, the village could still pay more than 100,000 jin of public grain to the state, but by 1956, it not only did not pay public grain but was supplied with 70,000 jin of food grain by the state. In short, marshiness and salinization have seriously threatened the most fertile wheat and cotton producing areas in Shanxi. It is necessary to vigorously stop the continued development of this serious situation.

Fifth, Shanxi has abundant water conservancy resources, but due to the limitations of economic conditions and the fact that our work cannot keep up, the utilization rate of resources is extremely low. According to hydrological data, the total amount of water flowing out of the province's rivers annually is 10.9 billion cubic meters, but currently only 2 billion cubic meters can be utilized, less than one-fifth of the total flow. If we can build reservoirs in advance and store a large amount of water, the Hebei Plain can be spared from disasters, which will be of great benefit to the comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River and Hai River. According to the understanding of some areas in 69 counties and cities, if the water conservancy of each river system is fully developed and the groundwater sources, mountain stream water, and spring water are utilized, it is expected that the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 33 million mu, accounting for about 50% of the total cultivated land area. However, at present, there are only 12.24 million mu of irrigated land in Shanxi Province, accounting for only 16% of the total cultivated land area of more than 70 million mu. This situation not only seriously affects the increase of the multiple cropping index in Shanxi but also seriously affects the exploration of the potential for land production increase.

From the above analysis, we can draw the following conclusion: resolutely and vigorously fighting against water, making every effort to control water and utilize water, is not only a fundamental measure to improve agricultural production in Shanxi, develop a variety of economies in mountainous areas such as agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and thoroughly change the backward state of agricultural production in Shanxi; but also an unshirkable task for the people of Shanxi to support neighboring provinces of Hebei and Henan in overcoming natural disasters and to cooperate with the comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River and Hai River projects. The specific methods of struggle are: do a good job in soil and water conservation and water conservancy construction, and build more reservoirs to store a large amount of water. We have always been clear about this point. In order to implement this measure, the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress has made a resolution, and the Provincial People's Committee has formulated specific implementation plans. The people of the whole province have made a lot of efforts under the leadership of the Party and government at all levels and have achieved certain results. As of the end of 1956, the province had completed 150,000 projects such as opening canals, repairing ponds, and building small reservoirs, and dug 110,000 wells, increasing the province's irrigated area from 3.68 million mu in 1949 to the current 12.24 million mu; a total of more than 70,000 flood control and drainage projects have been completed, 19.8 million mu have been afforested and mountains have been closed for forest cultivation, 10.7 million mu of terraced fields have been built, 5.21 million mu of pasture have been planted, and a total of 42.85 million mu of soil erosion can be controlled; at the same time, some experience has been gained in the investigation and improvement of salinized soil. The above-mentioned efforts have shown a certain effect in changing the natural features of Shanxi and improving agricultural production in Shanxi. The natural features of some areas have begun to change, and agricultural output has been improved. For example, through continuous efforts, the irrigated area in Hongzhao County has been greatly expanded, and the output has been greatly improved. At present, the county has 250,000 mu of clear water land, with an average yield of 600 jin per mu of grain land, 150,000 mu of flood land, with an average of 300 jin per mu of grain land, and 490,000 mu of dry land, with an average yield of 160 jin per mu. In 1956, Gaoping County harnessed the Dan River, and the irrigated area increased from 18,800 mu to 98,000 mu. After a portion of the land benefited, the grain output increased by 6.6 million jin that year, accounting for 45% of the county's total output increase. For example, the Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Jinluo Township, Zhongyang County, where soil erosion is very serious, had more than 300 mu of flat land that was flooded every year. In 1955, the output was reduced by more than 20,000 jin due to the disaster. In 1956, after soil and water conservation was carried out, although there were 14 major rainstorms, the soil and water did not leave the ditch, and the flat land was not eroded, so a bumper harvest was obtained. The most outstanding achievement is the Yangjingdi Agricultural Cooperative in Pingshun County. In five years, it has closed mountains for forest cultivation of 10,000 mu, planted 4,000 mu of barren mountains, planted 330,000 trees, built 1,013 water conservancy and soil and water conservation projects, 84 mu of silted beach land, 500 mu of flood irrigation land, and renovated 2,230 mu of terraced fields, basically changing the natural features and agricultural production of the entire village. In 1956, the agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production achieved an all-round bumper harvest. The total income of the cooperative was more than 100,000 yuan, with an average income of 105 yuan per person, an increase of 27% over 1955. Practice has proved that if we want to improve agricultural production, we must vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work and develop water conservancy construction. This is a fundamental measure, and we will unswervingly promote this measure throughout the province and adhere to it to the end.

We plan to expand the irrigated area by another 10.4 million mu, improve the irrigation area by 6 million mu, improve 1.7 million mu of saline-alkali land, build 17.3 million mu of terraced fields, afforest 40 million mu, plant 24.8 million mu of pasture, and manage 23.8 million mu of gullies in the ten years from 1958 to 1967, excluding the construction of reservoirs for the comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River and Hai River. It is estimated that after the completion of this plan, the historical features of Shanxi, which are prone to disasters, will be greatly changed. The land utilization rate will increase from the current 56% to 86%. Compared with the current level, the annual grain output will increase by 7.8 billion jin, and the total grain output will reach 16.4 billion jin, and the pasture output will increase by 15 billion jin. By 1967, calculated on the basis of an average of 20 million people in the province, each person will have 820 jin of grain. At the same time, with the development of agricultural production, various economies such as animal husbandry, fruit trees, sericulture, beekeeping, specialties, and sideline industries will also flourish. By then, it will make a great contribution to supporting national construction, cooperating with the comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River and Hai River, and supporting neighboring provinces of Hebei and Henan in reducing flood disasters and developing agricultural production.

However, the realization of such a huge and comprehensive plan for transforming nature is not an easy task. It requires a large investment of capital and labor and a persistent and long-term struggle to succeed. According to our preliminary and rough calculations, the completion of this plan will require a total investment of more than 480 million man-days and more than 420 million yuan in capital within ten years. The task is very arduous, because almost all soil and water conservation projects and a considerable part of water conservancy construction projects are distributed in the mountainous areas of western Shanxi, northwestern Shanxi, northeastern Shanxi, and Yanbei, where transportation is inconvenient, the area is sparsely populated, and the lives of farmers are relatively difficult. The investment capacity of farmers in these areas is very weak, and most of them are poor mountainous areas and old base areas that need state relief every year. According to this specific situation and the tasks of comprehensive treatment of the Yellow River and Hai River, requiring our province to complete the soil and water conservation work in mountainous areas ahead of schedule has increased the arduousness of the task. In the process of implementing this plan, in addition to relying mainly on the active efforts of our province and relying on the strength of the masses, we also hope that the central government can provide appropriate assistance and support in terms of economy and technical strength, and Hebei can provide strong assistance in coordinating with the comprehensive treatment of the Hai River project. In the past few years, our province has made some deviations in carrying out water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation work, but we have also accumulated and gained many valuable experiences and lessons, and mastered a part of hydrological and geological data; the broad masses of people have seen and realized the benefits of water conservancy construction and soil and water conservation work for increasing agricultural production from the achievements that have been made; the advanced agricultural cooperativization in the province has created the possibility of carrying out large-scale transformation of natural conditions, and confidence has been enhanced. With the joint efforts of the people of the whole province and under the correct leadership and support of the central government, I think the completion of this great and comprehensive plan for transforming nature will surely be successfully realized.

    全面改造自然  保证农业丰收
    坚决地大力地和水进行斗争，想尽一切办法利用水和控制水，不仅是改变山西农业生产落后状态的一项根本措施，而且是山西人民支援友邻省区战胜自然灾害以及配合根治黄河和海河工程的义不容辞的任务。
    王世英的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周总理的政府工作报告和其他几位负责同志的报告。从报告的事实中有力地证明了，过去一年来，我国在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业上已取得了伟大的成就，资产阶级右派分子反党反社会主义的言论和行动，在铁的事实面前已碰得粉碎。全国各阶层人民通过反右派的胜利斗争，认识更加明确了，团结更加巩固了，我们相信在全国各阶层各民族人民团结一致的基础上，将会进一步促进我国伟大的社会主义建设事业的不断胜利前进。有关驳斥右派分子的言论大家说得很多了，我完全同意和拥护，不再重复。我想就我省农业增产方面有关的水利建设问题谈一谈，以求得各方面有力的支持和帮助。
    山西的农业生产同全国各地一样，在中共中央和国务院正确领导之下，几年来已有很大的发展，特别在实现了农业高级合作化以后，发展的速度更为显著。如一九五六年全省虽然有一千一百九十万亩耕地遭受了严重的自然灾害，但粮食总产量还超过了历史上的最高年产量，达到了八十六亿七千万斤。农业生产发展的结果，使城乡广大人民生活得到相当的改善，使农村购买力有了显著的提高；同时有力的支援了国家工业建设和文化教育事业的发展。虽然如此，但还应当看到，山西农业发展的速度仍远远落在国家建设和人民生活需要的后面，从一九五二年到一九五六年，全省粮食单位面积产量一直在一百三十斤的水平上左右摇摆，总产量一直在七十六亿斤到八十六亿斤之间上下翻腾。这种缓慢的发展速度，与山西省工业建设迅速发展和城乡人口迅速增加的情况对比起来是很不相称的，现在已感到每年粮食不足，经济作物发展上也受到影响。这一形势如不迅速加以改变，今后所遇到的困难将是可以预料到的。我们必须想尽一切办法来改变这种情况，并且相信，在全省已经实现了农业高级合作化和全省人民团结一致的基础上，一定能够改变这种情况。
    山西省农业生产为什么不能迅速向前发展呢？这主要是受了自然条件的限制，山西每年所受春旱、秋涝、山洪、冰雹、盐渍碱化土地等自然灾害的影响是很大的，同时在我们领导上对如何控制水和利用水这一根本性的工作也抓的不紧，做的不够。为什么这样说呢？
    第一，山西地势高亢，气候干燥，全年降雨量只有四百公厘左右，而年蒸发量却在一千公厘以上；同时雨量的分布又极不均匀，多集中于七、八、九三个月内，在此时期降雨量约占全年总雨量的百分之六十以上，故形成十年九旱和春旱秋涝不能保种保收的现象。旱灾的威胁几乎年年都有。解放七年来，每年因旱成灾的耕地面积约在五百万亩左右，最严重的是一九五五年，从五月到八月总共只降雨七十三点四公厘，使五十六个县市遭受旱灾（全省共一百个县市），受灾耕地共达二千零十八万亩，虽经急救仍减产粮食十七亿斤，成灾人口达三百一十四万余人。
    第二，全省宜林、牧和可耕地总面积为二亿二千四百五十万亩，而山区即占一亿七千五百八十万亩，占全省总面积的百分之七十五，这些地区大部分缺乏森林、牧草复盖，砂石裸露，因而，无雨则十分干旱，有雨即山洪暴发，水土大量流失。据调查估算，严重水土流失面积共达一亿六千万亩，每年流失的泥沙量高达三亿吨以上（一系由桑干河、滹沱河、漳河经河北平原流入海河；一系由汾河、沁河经山西中、南部盆地流入黄河，流失泥沙量估计约各占一半），等于每年从山西山区每亩耕地上流失肥沃表土三万七千六百斤（约等于耕地表土的一寸多厚），其结果使广大的黄土丘陵地区的耕地土壤肥力逐年降低，加以这些地区地广人稀，耕作粗放，肥料少，雨水不足，所以单位面积产量，长期以来一直停留在每亩平均四十斤到六十斤的水平上而不能提高，有时甚至颗粒不收。这样严重的水土流失，不仅严重地危害着山西的农业生产，而且对于河北平原及豫北地区等友邻省份的农业生产也给了极大的危害；同时对官厅水库寿命的延长也受到极为严重的影响，如果这样继续下去，对三门峡水库的寿命也将是一很大的威胁。
    第三，山西为华北几条主要河流的发源地，由于山大光秃，气候变化无常，时有暴雨冰雹为灾；又因山势峻峭，河窄坡陡，源短流急，雨大时，山洪暴发泛滥成灾。七年来，全省每年平均有一千二百多个村镇，一百二十多万亩耕地遭受洪灾。最严重的是一九五四年和一九五六年。一九五四年共淹没庄稼四百四十九万亩，倒塌房屋二十余万间，死人四百一十九口，死大小牲畜三万七千八百多头；一九五六年淹没庄稼三百零四万亩，倒塌房屋十七万余间，死人七百五十口，伤人九百八十六口，死大小牲畜一万六千多头，冲毁灌溉、防洪、交通桥梁等工程七千零四十一处。同时还发生了平定县汪里村、平顺县车耽村、繁峙县狮子坪等三村陷山塌坡全村复没的毁灭性灾害，三小村共淹没房屋五百三十九间，死人二百三十七口，其他财产损失净尽。这种情况特别在各河系的上、中游，严重地破坏着山区和沿河地区的农业生产，到下游则给河北和河南等友邻省区造成更大的洪水灾害。据了解河北省两年遭受水灾的程度，比山西更为严重，仅一九五六年灾情统计：共淹没庄稼四千五百万亩，倒塌房屋二百六十多万间，成灾人口一千五百多万（其中重灾区人口九百万），因灾减产粮食五十亿斤，棉花三亿多斤。如把因灾减产及所受的一切损失和国家每年拨出的救济粮款加在一起，数目是相当惊人的。若能集中力量，早作治理，变水害为水利，每年将会给国家节约和生产出极大的财富来。
    第四，山西地形，周围环山，中间低洼，形成几个大盆地，这些地区本是我省精华所在，但由于缺乏应有的和合乎规格的灌溉和蓄水、排水系统，有些地区又沿习采用大水漫灌的办法，致使地下水位逐年上升，引起大量土地的沼泽化和盐渍化。全省目前大约共有沼泽地八十万亩，盐渍地一百六十万亩，其中已经完全弃耕者已达一百二十万亩，这种趋势无论晋南、晋中、忻定盆地和雁北盆地都还在继续发展中，这样下去情况是十分严重的。如雁北应县北河种村，过去为该县精华号称谷仓，共有好地万余亩，果园、菜园到处皆是，人民生活十分富裕，但自一九四八年以来，地下水位不断上升，土地逐渐碱化，现在只留下五千亩土地勉强可种，其余均碱化弃耕，果园、菜园均已无存，生产逐年下降，人民生活日渐贫困，该村一九四九年还能向国家交纳公粮十万余斤，到一九五六年不仅未出公粮，反由国家供应了口粮七万斤。总之沼泽化和盐渍化已严重威胁着山西最富饶的麦棉产区。必须大力制止这一严重形势的延续发展。
    第五，山西有丰富的水利资源，但由于经济条件的限制和我们的工作赶不上去，以致对资源的利用率极低。根据水文资料推算，全省河流年流出水的总量达一百零九亿公方，但目前仅能利用二十亿公方，不到总流量的五分之一。如能提前兴修水库、大量蓄水即可使河北平原免于灾害，对根治黄河、海河大有裨益。又据六十九个县市部分地区的了解，如充分开发各河系的水利和利用地下水源以及山涧溪水和泉水，预计可扩大水浇地三千三百多万亩，约占耕地总面积的百分之五十左右，但现在山西全省只有水浇地一千二百二十四万亩，仅占耕地总面积七千多万亩的百分之十六，这种情况不但严重地影响着山西复播指数的提高，也严重地影响土地增产潜在力的发掘。
    从以上几方面的分析可以得出这样的结论：坚决大力地和水进行斗争，想尽一切办法控制水和利用水，不仅是提高山西农业生产，发展山区农、林、牧多种经济，彻底改变山西农业生产的落后状态的一项根本措施；而且也是山西人民支援河北、河南友邻省区战胜自然灾害以及配合根治黄河和海河工程的一项义不容辞的任务。斗争的具体方法是：做好水土保持和水利建设，多建水库大量蓄水。对于这一点，我们一向是明确的，为了贯彻执行这一措施，山西省人民代表大会曾作过决议，省人民委员会曾制定了具体实施方案，全省人民在各级党和政府的领导下已做了不少的努力，并且已取得了一定的成绩。截至一九五六年年底止，全省共完成开渠、修塘、构筑小型水库等工程十五万件、打井十一万眼，使全省的灌溉面积由一九四九年的三百六十八万亩增加到现在的一千二百二十四万亩；共修成防洪、排涝工程七万余宗，造林和封山育林一千九百八十万亩，修梯田一千零七十万亩，种牧草五百二十一万亩，共可控制水土流失面积四千二百八十五万亩；同时在调查和改良盐渍化土壤方面也取得了一些经验。上述努力，对于改变山西的自然面貌，提高山西的农业生产已经显示出一定的作用，部分地区的自然面貌已经开始改变，农业产量已有所提高。例如洪赵县经过不断的努力，灌溉面积大为扩展，产量大大提高，现全县有清水地二十五万亩，每亩粮田平均产量达六百斤，洪水地十五万亩，每亩粮田平均达三百斤，旱地粮田四十九万亩，每亩平均产量为一百六十斤。高平县一九五六年治理丹河，水浇地由一万八千八百亩增加到九万八千亩，在一部分土地受益之后，当年就增产粮食六百六十万斤，占全县总增产量的百分之四十五。再如，水土流失很严重的中阳县金罗乡金星农业社，原有三百多亩平地每年遭受水灾，一九五五年曾因灾减产二万余斤，一九五六年进行了水土保持之后，虽经过十四次较大的暴雨，水土均未出沟，平地未遭冲蚀，因而获得了丰收。成绩最突出的是平顺县羊井底农业社，在五年的时间内，封山育林一万亩，荒山播种四千亩，植树三十三万株，修筑水利、水土保持工程一千零十三件，淤滩地八十四亩，引洪浇地五百亩，整修梯田二千二百三十亩，把全村的自然面貌和农业生产情况基本上改变了，一九五六年农、林、牧、副业生产获得了全面丰收，全社共收入十万余元，平均每人收入一百零五元，比一九五五年提高百分之二十七。实践证明，要想提高农业生产，就必须大力进行水土保持工作和发展水利建设事业，这是一项根本性的措施，我们将毫不动摇的把这一措施在全省普遍推行起来，并坚持贯彻到底。
    我们计划在一九五八年到一九六七年的十年之内，除根治黄河、海河兴建水库不计外，拟再扩大水浇地一千零四十万亩，改善灌溉面积六百万亩，改良盐碱地一百七十万亩，修梯田一千七百三十万亩，造林四千万亩，种牧草二千四百八十万亩，治理沟壑二千三百八十万亩。预计这个计划完成之后，对山西来说，多灾的历史面貌将会大大改观，土地利用率将由现在的百分之五十六提高到百分之八十六，和现在水平比较，每年将增产粮食七十八亿斤，粮食总产量将达到一百六十四亿斤，增产牧草一百五十亿斤。到一九六七年全省按二千万人口平均计算，每人将有粮食八百二十斤。同时随着农业生产的发展，畜牧、果树、蚕桑、养蜂、特产、副业等各种经济也会蓬勃地发展起来。到那时，对于支援国家建设，配合根治黄河、海河，对于支援河北、河南友邻省减少洪水灾害发展农业生产等将会有巨大的贡献。
    但实现这样一个巨大的全面的改造自然规划，并不是件轻而易举的事，需要付出很大的投资和劳力，经过一个坚持不懈的较长时期的斗争才能成功。经我们初步粗略计算，完成这个计划十年之内共需投入劳力四亿八千多万个，资金四亿二千多万元。任务是十分艰巨的，因为几乎是全部水土保持工程和相当一部分水利建设工程是分布在交通不便，地广人稀，农民生活较苦的晋西、晋西北、晋东北和雁北等山区，而这些地区农民的投资力很薄弱，多半是每年需要国家救济的贫困山区和老根据地，根据这一具体情况以及根治黄河、海河等任务，要求我省提前完成山区的水土保持工作，就更增加了任务的艰巨性。在实施这个计划的过程中，除了主要靠我省积极努力，依靠群众自身力量之外，还希望中央能在经济上和技术力量上给予适当的帮助和支持，河北方面在配合根治海河工程上能予以大力协助。几年来我省在进行水利建设和水土保持工作中，虽出过一些偏差，但也积累和取得了许多宝贵经验和教训，并掌握了一部分水文、地质资料；广大群众从已得的成绩中看到和体会到水利建设和水土保持工作对农业增产的利益；全省农业高级合作化更创造了进行大规模改造自然条件的可能性，信心增强了，这些积极的有利因素，在我省全体人民共同努力下，在中央的正确领导和支持下，我想完成这个伟大的全面的改造自然规划，一定能胜利实现。
