Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued its plenary discussion this morning. Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others made written self-criticisms at the meeting, expressing their "submission and confession to the people," and requested to continue making thorough explanations. Zhang Naiqi also made a written self-criticism, acknowledging some of his erroneous statements.

Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, and others also made written self-criticisms at the meeting.

A total of twenty-five people spoke today. The general discussion of the meeting concluded here. A total of four hundred and eight people spoke at the meeting.

Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, spoke at the meeting on the U.S. aggressive clique's policy of hostility toward our country. He said: "The U.S. aggressive clique has recently issued many arrogant cries against the Chinese people, attempting to maintain their bankrupt policy of hostility toward the Chinese people. On June 28, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles personally came forward to defend this policy and falsely accused the People's Republic of China of five 'incitements to war' in the past seven years."

Zhang Hanfu cited irrefutable facts to vigorously refute Dulles' slander against our country. He said that it is not the People's Republic of China, but the U.S. aggressive clique represented by Dulles himself, that "has a record of continuous armed aggression."

Zhang Hanfu said that Dulles viciously slandered the Chinese people because he wanted to use this method of reversing right and wrong to cover up the U.S. aggressive clique's evil conspiracy to carry out armed aggression, establish military bases, and wage war threats in the Far East.

Zhang Hanfu accused the United States of undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement and creating tensions, and undermining the peace and independence of the countries of Indochina; at the same time, he pointed out that Dulles wanted to find an excuse for the United States to further interfere in the Philippines and Malaya.

Zhang Hanfu sternly accused the United States of carrying out subversive activities in Tibet, China, and of occupying Taiwan.

Zhang Hanfu pointed out that Dulles, in his speech on June 28 which reversed right and wrong, exposed the U.S. conspiracy to engage in subversive activities in China by encouraging and supporting the words and actions of bourgeois rightists in our country who oppose the Communist Party.

Finally, Zhang Hanfu said: "The problem now is that the United States insists on being hostile to our country, occupying Taiwan, and carrying out subversive activities against our country. The Chinese people cannot but express their firmest opposition to such a policy and must wage a long-term and resolute struggle against this imperialist aggressive policy and will never give up until the goal is achieved."

Hu Sheng sternly refuted the anti-socialist scientific work program put forward by the rightists in his speech. He called on Marxist social science researchers to actively rise up to smash the bourgeois social science restoration conspiracy and the capitalist restoration conspiracy.

Hu Sheng pointed out that some rightists maliciously criticize us for neglecting social sciences, but their purpose is actually to demand that bourgeois social sciences be valued. They are attempting to restore bourgeois social sciences under the guise of valuing social sciences. The opinions put forward in the name of the Science Planning Group of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League mainly put forward such a proposition of letting bourgeois social sciences be restored in the field of social sciences. This is one of the most important contents of the entire reactionary program of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Luo Yi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said that if the rightists want to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, they need to find masses who can wave flags and shout for them. They attempted to find supporters and sympathizers among young intellectuals who lack social and political experience. They took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to spread poison and ignite fires everywhere. But what are the facts? Those who followed these rightist leaders were nothing more than a very few scum like Lin Xiling and Tan Tianrong. Some students were once deceived, but the vast majority of students always stood on the side of the Party. Luo Yi pointed out that Chinese youth have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Since the "May Fourth Movement," the Chinese youth movement has always been under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party. Anyone who attempts to separate Chinese youth from the Communist Party will surely suffer a shameful defeat.

Luo Yi said that today, the flames of class struggle in our country have not been extinguished, and the ideas and habits of the bourgeoisie still have a great influence on young people. Therefore, the most important thing for young people in our country is to firmly establish a proletarian stance and learn to judge whether people's words and actions are correct according to the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao. They must also constantly and humbly learn from workers and peasants and be firmly linked with workers and peasants.

Zhang Bojun, in his written self-criticism entitled "Submitting and Confessing to the People," admitted that his erroneous thoughts and crimes had historical roots, a reactionary class essence, and consistency. He said that since last year, he had been advocating the trite ideas of bourgeois rightists in many private conversations and meetings of all sizes. He said that under the guidance of his anti-socialist and anti-people bourgeois rightist ideology, the serious erroneous words and deeds he had committed in the past year or so, especially during the period of helping the Party in its rectification campaign, were unforgivable.

Zhang Bojun said that when he proposed in 1956 that the CPPCC be regarded as a "Senate," and this year at a forum held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, he put forward the idea of a "Political Design Institute," these proposals were undoubtedly intended to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat and the system of the People's Congress with bourgeois democracy, which would inevitably lead to the anti-Party and anti-people path of capitalist restoration.

Zhang Bojun admitted that he had proposed that the democratic parties should develop one or two million members and that the organizations of the democratic parties could be developed to the county level. He had also said that after the basic completion of socialism, the nature and tasks of the democratic parties should be re-evaluated, and the nature and tasks of the democratic parties should be raised a step higher. He said that these proposals of his were an attempt to expand the political forces of the democratic parties, increase political capital, and satisfy his personal political desires, forming a situation of "rivaling" the Party.

Regarding the Zhang-Luo alliance, Zhang Bojun said that their alliance was "from ideological resonance to political alliance." The most basic factor in the alliance was that they both stood on the bourgeois position. He compromised with Luo Longji in order to gain a certain political influence among the intellectuals in the China Democratic League through Luo Longji's connections.

Zhang Bojun said that the purpose of his and Luo Longji's convening of four group discussions in the China Democratic League when the CPC's rectification campaign began was to use a set of bourgeois views of intellectuals to promote bourgeois democracy and science, and to confuse the people's understanding of the superiority of socialism and the irremovability of the Party's leadership.

Zhang Bojun also examined his arrogant anti-Party conspiracy of convening six professors' meetings on June 6, examined his behavior of tampering with the political direction of Guangming Daily, and his attempt to gain political capital through the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. He finally said that his self-criticism today was not comprehensive or profound enough. He will continue to make a thorough explanation to the relevant departments on all the issues that must be explained.

Luo Longji said in his written statement that he was "a person who has committed a crime," and he expressed his "submission and confession" to the people's representatives and the people of the whole country.

First, he said that his speech at the United Front Work Department forum on May 22 "had the responsibility of provoking and igniting the recent rampant attacks on the Party and chaotic behavior of rightists, even reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries, throughout the country." It was "completely losing the stand of the Chinese people, becoming a spokesman for the enemy, and supporting the enemy."

Second, he talked about his remarks on the "contradiction between the Communist Party and the democratic parties in the development of intellectuals." He said that this "actually amounted to hoping that the Communist Party would not develop among intellectuals in order to achieve the purpose of expanding the organization of the democratic parties, strengthening their forces, and rivaling the leading Party."

Third, he admitted that "for more than a year, he had cooperated with Zhang Bojun in directing the China Democratic League in the right direction." Therefore, the rightists in the China Democratic League participated in the rampant anti-Party and anti-socialist attacks, "which was not accidental."

Fourth, he said that since 1949, he had been engaging in sectarianism and engaging in "intangible organizations" in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. "This intangible organization not only exists in Beijing, but is also spread in many provinces in East China, Central South, and Southwest China." He admitted that a group of people in this "intangible organization" had "almost all had anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and behaviors in the rightist attack, and even colluded with local rightists to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies."

Fifth, he said that after the Hungarian incident, he believed it was a "split" in the peace camp. He admitted that he "arbitrarily spread the pessimistic atmosphere of the international situation."

Sixth, regarding his relationship with Wenhui Daily, he admitted that he "cannot shirk the responsibility for the influence he often instilled in rightist ideas through Pu Xixiu."

Luo Longji also examined his mistakes in the Ministry of Forestry and his mistakes of pride and complacency and contempt for progressive elements.

Regarding the "Zhang-Luo Alliance," he made some defenses. He admitted that for more than a year, he and Zhang Bojun had supported each other politically, leading the China Democratic League in the wrong direction, attempting to "jointly decide national policies with the Communist Party and exercise power in parallel," but he did not think this was an alliance between Zhang and Luo.

Luo Longji finally asked the people's representatives to allow him "the opportunity to make further thorough confession in the future."

Zhang Naiqi, in his written statement, emphasized that the nature of his mistakes "is the ideology and style of bourgeois individualism." He talked about a lot of his ideological "individualism," "individual heroism," "individual liberalism," and "individualistic impulse," as well as "one-sidedness" in his thinking methods, and so on.

Zhang Naiqi negated his erroneous arguments that "fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income," "there is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements," and "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." He emphasized that these were all "theoretical errors."

Zhang Naiqi said, "A person who has committed serious bourgeois individualism definitely belongs to the right wing on the ideological front," but he also said that he "really has nothing in common with those rightists who are politically anti-Party and anti-socialist."

Zhang Naiqi did not admit that he had made anti-Party and anti-socialist agitation among industrialists and businessmen. He said, "I have always believed that my problem is only a problem of thought; my mistake is only a theoretical mistake. Of course, if my theoretical mistakes have caused fluctuations beyond the influence of the trend of the times, then I should be responsible."

Huang Shaohong, in his written statement, examined the erroneous opinions he put forward at the forum of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, as well as the errors in his work inspection and usual words and deeds. He said that he "forgot the sins of history," "which led to many anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and actions, which are not only intolerable to human feelings but also intolerable to legal principles." He said that he had always suspected the mass struggle method in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, which was his ideological manifestation of leaving a way out for counter-revolutionary elements by departing from the people's stand. He said that some of the problems he reflected at the CPPCC forum "99% were based on letters from counter-revolutionary elements or their family members, or events seen and heard during inspections." He also explained some of his relationships with Lin Xiling and Xie Xin. He said that his "anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and actions are not accidental, but have historical roots and are consistent from beginning to end." He hoped to continue to receive criticism and help.

Chen Mingshu, in his written statement, examined his many absurd remarks such as "abolishing the school party committee system" and "only mentioning shortcomings and not mentioning advantages," which are a kind of anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist crime. He said that although he had emphasized that "his subjective wishes were good intentions and he did not attempt to shake the basic system of the country, and at the same time he did not have the slightest connection with the Zhang-Luo alliance and anyone in the alliance, but the destructive effect that occurred objectively was consistent with the anti-Party activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and in terms of ideological essence, they were also of the same vein."

Chen Mingshu said, "Some representatives criticized me as an ambitious person with a desire to be a great leader. Judging from the historical development and ideological essence, these are unavoidable facts." He said that "the history of his life is ugly, and all his past activities in the military and political fields were reactionary and speculative." "Although he has undergone many years of party education after liberation, due to deep-rooted habits, he has not yet changed his position, and this bad trait will emerge as soon as there is an opportunity."

Tan Tiwu, member of the Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Zhang Yunchuan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Pan Dakui, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Li Boqiu, member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Ma Zhemin, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Huang Yaomian, member of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic League, Song Yunbin, Deputy Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, and Qian Sunqing, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, also made self-criticisms or written self-criticisms at the meeting today.

The representatives who made written statements today also included Chen Qiyuan, Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways, Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou, Chen Li, Deputy Director of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, Xiang De, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, the famous Henan Opera actress Chang Xiangyu, soccer player Zhang Junxiu, and Li Chenggan, Director of the National Bureau of Metrology.

The executive chairmen of the morning session were: Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Wu Yuzhang, Deng Yingchao, Ma Yinchu, Zhao Maochen, Sheng Pihua, Zhao Zhongyao, Chen Wangdao, Yang Zhihua, and Dao Jingban.

    全国人民代表大会会议结束讨论
    章汉夫痛驳杜勒斯颠倒是非
    章伯钧罗隆基等右派首脑表示“向人民低头认罪”
    新华社15日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天上午继续进行大会讨论。章伯钧、罗隆基等人在会上作了书面检讨，表示“向人民低头认罪”，并要求继续作彻底交代。章乃器也作了书面检讨，他承认了他的一些错误言论。
    黄绍竑、陈铭枢等人也在会上作了书面检讨。
    今天发言的共有二十五人。大会讨论到此结束，前后在大会上发言的共有四百零八人。
    外交部副部长章汉夫在大会上就美国侵略集团敌视我国的政策发言。他说：“美国侵略集团最近对中国人民发出了许多狂妄的叫嚣，企图维持他们已经破产的敌视中国人民的政策。6月28日美国国务卿杜勒斯又亲自出马来为这种政策辩护，并且诬蔑中华人民共和国七年来犯了五次‘鼓动战争’的‘罪行’”。
    章汉夫举出无可辩驳的事实痛驳杜勒斯对我国的这些诬蔑。他说，“具有连续进行武装侵略记录”的不是中华人民共和国，而正是以杜勒斯为代表的美国侵略集团自己。
    章汉夫说，杜勒斯之所以恶毒地诬蔑中国人民，是因为他想用这种颠倒是非的办法来掩饰美国侵略集团在远东地区进行武装侵略、建立军事基地和进行战争威胁的罪恶阴谋。
    章汉夫指责美国破坏朝鲜停战协定和制造紧张局势，破坏印度支那各国的和平和独立；同时指出杜勒斯想寻找借口，以便美国对菲律宾和马来亚进行进一步的干涉。
    章汉夫严正地指责美国在我国西藏进行颠复活动以及霸占台湾。
    章汉夫指出，杜勒斯在6月28日那篇颠倒是非的演说中，对于我国资产阶级右派分子反对共产党的言论和行动的鼓励和支持，把美国在中国搞颠复活动的阴谋暴露无遗。
    最后，章汉夫说：“现在的问题是美国坚持敌视我国，侵占我国台湾，对我国进行颠复活动的问题。对于这样的政策，中国人民不能不表示最坚决的反对，并且要对这个帝国主义侵略政策进行长期的坚决的斗争，不达目的，决不罢休。”
    胡绳在发言中严正驳斥了右派分子提出的反社会主义的科学工作纲领。他要求马克思主义的社会科学研究工作者，积极地起来为粉碎资产阶级社会科学复辟阴谋和资本主义复辟阴谋而斗争。
    胡绳指出，有些右派分子恶意地批评我们轻视社会科学，其目的实际上是要求重视资产阶级社会科学。他们是在重视社会科学的叫嚣下面企图使资产阶级的社会科学复辟。以民盟中央科学规划问题小组的名义提出来的意见书，在社会科学方面主要的就是提出了这样一个让资产阶级社会科学复辟的主张。这是章罗同盟的全部反动纲领中极为重要的内容之一。
    共青团中央书记处书记罗毅说，右派分子要进行反党、反社会主义的勾当，就需要找能够为他们摇旗呐喊的群众。他们企图从缺乏社会政治经验的知识青年中，找到他们的附和者和支持者。他们利用共产党整风的机会，到处放毒、点火。但是事实怎样呢？跟着这批右派头子跑的也不过是极少数像林希翎、谭天荣这样的败类。有一部分学生曾被蒙蔽，而极大多数学生始终站在党的一边。罗毅指出：中国青年有光荣的革命传统，从“五四运动”以来，中国青年运动一直就是在伟大的中国共产党领导之下的。谁妄想把中国青年跟共产党分裂开来，谁就一定会遭到可耻的失败。
    罗毅说，今天，在我国阶级斗争的火焰并没有熄灭，资产阶级的思想和习惯对青年还发生着很大的影响。因此，对我国青年来说，最最重要的事情就是要巩固地确立起无产阶级立场，学会按照毛主席提出的六项政治标准去鉴别人们的言论、行动是否正确。还必须经常虚心地向工农学习，牢固地和工农连结在一起。
    章伯钧在以“向人民低头认罪”为题的书面检讨中，承认他的错误思想和罪行是有历史的根源、反动的阶级本质和一贯性的。他说，从去年以来他就在许多私人谈话和大小会议上鼓吹资产阶级右派思想的滥调。他说，他在反社会主义反人民的资产阶级右派思想主导之下，最近一年多来，特别是在帮助党整风期间所犯的严重错误的言行，是难以饶恕的。
    章伯钧说，他在1956年提出把政协作为“参议院”看待，今年在中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上，他又提出“政治设计院”的主张，这些主张是不折不扣地想用资产阶级的民主，来代替无产阶级专政，来代替人民代表大会制度，其结果必然走上反党反人民的资本主义复辟道路上去。
    章伯钧承认他曾提出过民主党派要发展一、二百万人、民主党派组织可以发展到县一级的主张，也曾说过社会主义基本完成后，民主党派的性质与任务应该重新估价，应该把民主党派的性质和任务提高一步。他说，他的这些主张是企图扩大民主党派的政治势力，增加政治资本，以满足个人的政治欲望，形成同党“分庭抗礼”的形势。
    关于章罗联盟问题，章伯钧说，他们联盟是“由思想上的共鸣，进到政治上的联盟”，联盟的结合，最基本的因素是由于彼此都是站在资产阶级的立场。他向罗隆基妥协，是想通过罗隆基的关系在民盟内大知识分子中间取得一定的政治影响。
    章伯钧说，他与罗隆基在中共整风开始时在民盟组织四个小组座谈会的目的，是想通过大知识分子一套资产阶级的看法，宣扬资产阶级的民主和科学，混淆人民对于社会主义优越性和党的领导不可动摇性的认识。
    章伯钧还检查了他在6月6日召集六教授开会的狂妄的反党阴谋，检查了篡改光明日报政治方向的行为和他企图通过农工民主党取得政治资本的活动。他最后说，他今天的检讨不够全面也不够深刻。关于一切必须交代的问题，他将继续向有关单位彻底交代。
    罗隆基在他的书面发言中说，他是“一个有了罪过的人”，他表示向人民代表和全国人民“低头认罪”。
    首先，他说他5月22日在统战部座谈会上的发言，“对最近全国各地右派分子，甚至反动分子和反革命分子猖狂向党进攻的造乱行为，有了挑拨和点火的责任”。是“完全失去了中国人民的立场，成了敌人的代言人，为敌人张目”。
    其次，他谈到他的关于“共产党和民主党派在知识分子中发展的矛盾”的言论，他说，这“实际等于希望共产党不在知识分子中发展，以达到民主党派扩大组织、加强力量，对领导党分庭抗礼的目的”。
    第三、他承认他“一年多来，同章伯钧合作，把民盟指向了右的方向”。因此，民盟中的右派分子参加了反党反社会主义的猖狂进攻，“这不是偶然的”。
    第四、他说，从1949年起，他在民盟中央闹宗派主义，搞“无形组织”，“这个无形组织不仅在北京有，并且散布在华东、中南和西南许多省份”。他承认，这个“无形组织”中的一批人在右派的进攻中，“几乎都有了反党反社会主义的言论和行为，甚至还勾结了当地的右派分子进行反党反社会主义的阴谋”。
    第五、他说，匈牙利事件以后，他曾认为是和平阵营的“分裂”。他承认他“任意散布国际形势的悲观空气”。
    第六、关于他同文汇报的关系，他承认，他“通过浦熙修经常灌输右派思想的影响是不能推卸责任的”。
    罗隆基另外还检讨了他在森林工业部的错误，和骄傲自满、轻视进步分子的错误。
    关于“章罗联盟”问题，他作了一些辩解。他承认一年多来同章伯钧在政治上互相支持，使民盟走上错误的方向，企图“同共产党共同决定国策，平行执掌政权”，但是他不认为这是章罗的联盟。
    罗隆基最后要求人民代表让他将来“有进一步彻底坦白交代的机会”。
    章乃器在书面发言中，强调他的错误的性质“是资产阶级的个人主义的思想和作风”。他谈了一大堆他思想上的“个人主义”、“个人英雄主义”、“个人自由主义”以及“个人主义的意气”、思想方法上的“片面性”等等。
    章乃器否定了他的“定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获”，“资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子没有本质的区别”、“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”的错误论点。他强调这些都是“理论上的错误”。
    章乃器说，“一个犯有严重的资产阶级个人主义的人，他在思想战线上肯定是属于右派的”，但是他又说，他“同那些在政治上反党、反社会主义的右派分子，的确是毫无相同之处”。
    章乃器不承认他在工商业者中作过反党反社会主义的鼓动。他说，“我始终认为，我的问题只是思想的问题；我的错误只是理论上的错误。当然，如果我的理论错误已经造成了超出时代思潮影响所可能引起的波动，那我应该负责。”
    黄绍竑在书面发言中检讨了他在中共中央统战部座谈会上所提的错误意见，以及视察工作和平时言论行动上的错误。他说，他“把历史的罪恶忘了”，“以致发生许多反党、反人民、反社会主义的言论和行动，不但人情所不许，也为法理所不容。”他说，他一向怀疑肃反运动中的群众性的斗争方式，这就是他脱离人民立场为反革命分子留后路的思想表现。他说，他在政协座谈会反映的一些问题，“99％都是根据反革命分子或其家属的来信，或视察中所见所闻的事件”。他还交代了他同林希翎、谢昕的一些关系。他说，他的“反党、反人民、反社会主义的言论和行动并不是偶然的，是有历史根源的，前后一贯的”，他希望继续得到批判和帮助。
    陈铭枢在书面发言中检讨他发表的“撤销学校党委制”、“只提缺点不提优点”等许多荒谬言论，是一种反党、反人民、反社会主义的罪恶。他说，尽管他曾强调“自己的主观愿望是善意的，并没有动摇国家基本制度的企图，同时也没有与章罗联盟及其联盟中的任何人有丝毫联系，但在客观上所发生的破坏作用，是与章罗联盟的反党活动一致的，而且在思想本质上与他们也是一脉相承的。”
    陈铭枢说，“有的代表批评我是一个野心家，有大领袖欲，从我的历史发展和我的思想本质来看，这都是不可逃避的事实”。他说，他“一生的历史是丑恶的，过去在军事、政治上的一切活动都是反动的、投机的”，“解放后虽然经过多年的党的教育，但由于积习太深，还没有把立场转变过来，而这种劣根性，一有机会就会冒出”。
    今天在会上检讨或作书面检讨的还有民革中常委谭惕吾，民盟中央副秘书长、农工民主党中央执行局委员张云川，民盟四川省委主任委员潘大逵，农工民主党中央执行局委员李伯球，民盟湖北省委主任委员马哲民，民盟中常委黄药眠，民盟浙江省委副主任委员宋云彬和江苏省工商联主任委员钱孙卿。
    今天作书面发言的代表还有内务部副部长陈其瑗、铁道部部长滕代远、中苏友好协会总会秘书长钱俊瑞、广州市市长朱光、长江水利委员会副主任陈离、湖南省工商联主任委员向德、著名豫剧演员常香玉、足球运动员张俊秀、国家计量局局长李承干。
    上午大会执行主席是：陈叔通、程潜、吴玉章、邓颖超、马寅初、赵毛臣、盛丕华、赵忠尧、陈望道、杨之华、刀京版。
