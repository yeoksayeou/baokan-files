The following is the English translation:

I sincerely support Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, and reports on other tasks, and I will vigorously promote and strive to assist the government in implementing and executing them. I am a representative of the Hui people, and I would like to speak about some aspects of the lives of the Hui people in the Qinghai region before and after liberation.

The Tragic Past Cannot Be Exhausted in Three Days and Three Nights

There are more than 270,000 Hui people in the Qinghai region, the vast majority of whom live in agricultural areas. Before liberation, although the reactionary ruler at the time, Ma Bufang, was also a Hui person in terms of ethnic composition, he was a reactionary ringleader who implemented the policies of the reactionary Kuomintang government and served the reactionary ruling class. Therefore, the Hui people in the Qinghai region, like other ethnic groups, were in a position of being oppressed and enslaved, living a very poor, painful, and fearful existence. At that time, most of the young and middle-aged men were drafted into the army by the Ma bandits, and a small number of young and middle-aged men also fled and became displaced for fear of being drafted. Due to the lack of labor in the countryside, crops had not yielded good harvests for many years. Coupled with the reactionary government's exorbitant taxes and levies, the lives of the masses were very miserable. They ate coarse highland barley and wore coarse woolen jackets. In some years, farmers could not even afford highland barley or woolen jackets. If a disaster occurred, large numbers of people would starve to death. I remember one year when a disaster occurred, the price of grain reached 100 silver dollars per stone, and more than 1,000 people starved to death. At the same time, due to traffic blockages at that time, coupled with the so-called "departure tax," various supplies became very expensive once they reached Qinghai. For example, at that time, 100 jin of wool in Qinghai could only be exchanged for one or two bricks of tea (now 100 jin of wool can be exchanged for more than ten to twenty bricks of tea). People's daily necessities were often difficult to buy or unaffordable. The material life of the people was like this at that time, and other aspects were even more unimaginable. Take education as an example. At that time, Ma Bufang ran a Kunlun Middle School. This school was nominally a middle school, but in reality, it was a military training camp. Students had to enter this school before even graduating from elementary school (sometimes even before graduating from junior elementary school). After entering, they did not learn science and culture, but rather war and killing. After graduation (sometimes even before graduation), they were completely used as soldiers, and even eleven- or twelve-year-old children were incorporated into the army to serve as cannon fodder. Looking at the religious beliefs of the Hui people at that time, their religious beliefs were also frequently persecuted. The Imams, Ahongs, and Mullas of the mosques often could not engage in their religious professions with peace of mind. Some mosques also had to pay exorbitant taxes and levies and hire laborers for Ma Bufang. Some mosques used all the donations and grain given by religious followers each year to pay exorbitant taxes and levies and hire laborers, forcing the Ahongs to be unable to maintain their livelihoods and had to leave the mosques. There was also a period when, due to the shortage of conscripts, even the Mullas of the mosques were reorganized into the army. Even more tragic was that the reactionary ruling class created ethnic contradictions at that time. Ethnic and sectarian disputes occurred frequently in various places, sometimes resulting in bloodshed, broken families, and long-term inability to produce in entire villages and townships. All of the above-mentioned tragic and painful lives simply cannot be exhausted in three days and three nights, and these painful life experiences will not be forgotten by anyone.

Where Did Today's Good Life Come From?

1949 finally arrived. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and drove away the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs. From then on, the people of all ethnic groups were forever freed from those suffering days and saw the light of day. After liberation, the Communist Party and the People's Government implemented a policy of ethnic equality and unity, and implemented ethnic regional autonomy in minority areas. According to the policy of freedom of religious belief, religious temples and the religious activities of religious believers were respected and protected. In the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, our Hui people and other ethnic groups have carried out land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance against America and aid to Korea, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and other tasks. The understanding of the people of all ethnic groups has been enhanced, disputes between and within ethnic groups have basically disappeared, and ethnic unity has been greatly strengthened. Furthermore, on the basis of these tasks, the socialist transformation has been basically completed. More than 90% of the Hui people and other ethnic groups have jointly organized ethnic joint cooperatives, which has provided a solid foundation for ethnic unity. Now, all ethnic groups work together, unite, love each other, and are as close as a family. In the past few years, through the correct implementation of the five major movements, socialist transformation, and other policies, agricultural production has developed considerably, and the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have improved considerably. Purchasing power has increased by about two times compared to 1949. In the past, sometimes even coarse grains were not available, but now they can eat white flour. In the past, the masses mostly wore coarse sackcloth or at most coarse twill, but now many people can wear fine khaki fabric. Before liberation, only a few wealthy families fried oily cakes for the Eid al-Adha festival, but now frying oily cakes has become widespread for the Eid al-Adha festival, and the Eid al-Adha festival is becoming more and more prosperous year by year. All of this is a world of difference compared to the period of Chiang and Ma bandit gangs rule. And how did all this come about? It came about because the Communist Party led the people of all ethnic groups to take the socialist road. Without the leadership of the Communist Party and without the socialist road, it would be impossible for minority nationalities to have what they have today.

However, strangely enough, recently those bourgeois rightists have actually obliterated the great achievements of the Communist Party's leadership and launched a massive attack on the Communist Party and the people of all ethnic groups, even secretly organizing alliances, attempting to abolish the Communist Party's leadership, overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship, and prevent the people of all ethnic groups from taking the socialist road. This arrogant idea that violates the will of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country will never succeed. The eyes of the people of all ethnic groups are sharp and will not be confused by the fallacies of the bourgeois rightists. On behalf of the Hui people in the Qinghai region, I express that we must resolutely oppose this fallacy of the bourgeois rightists, resolutely shatter this conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists, and continue to unite the people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government to resolutely take the socialist road in the future.

    青海回族人民的恨和爱
    马兴泰的发言
    我真诚的拥护毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告，拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和其他各项工作的报告，并要大力宣传，努力协助政府贯彻和执行。我是个回民代表，我就青海地区解放前后回民生活的一些情况作如下发言。
    惨痛的往事三天三夜说不完
    青海地区有回民二十七万多人，绝大多数居住在农业区，各县解放前，虽然当时的反动统治者马步芳，就民族成分来看，也是回族，但由于他本身是个反动头子，执行着国民党反动政府的政策，为反动统治阶级服务，所以青海地区的回民所处的地位和其他民族一样，是被压迫、被奴役的地位，生活是非常贫穷、痛苦、惊恐不安的。当时大部分青壮年被马匪拉了壮丁，少部分青壮年也因怕拉壮丁而逃亡在外，流离失所。农村里因劳力缺乏，庄稼多年没有好的收成，再加上反动政府的苛捐杂税、差役等等，群众的生活非常凄惨，吃的是粗粮青稞，穿的是粗羊毛织成的褐褂，有些年间农民连青稞也吃不到，褐褂也穿不上，如果发生了灾荒，就大批的饿死人。记得曾有一年因发生灾荒，粮食每石卖价达到一百多白洋，饿死了一千多人。同时，因那时候的交通阻塞，再加上所谓“离境税”等等，各种物资用品一到青海就非常昂贵，例如那时青海的一百斤羊毛，只能换一两块砖茶（现在一百斤羊毛，能换十多块至二十块砖茶），人民的生活必需品，经常不容易买到或买不起。那时人民的物质生活都是这样的，其他就更不堪设想了。以教育来说吧，那时马步芳办过一个昆仑中学，这所学校名义上是中学，实际上是军事训练所，学生还等不到小学毕业（有时还等不到初小毕业），就得进这所学校，进去后，学的不是科学、文化，而是学的战争和杀人，等到毕业（有时还等不到毕业），就完全去充当军队，甚至将十一、二岁的儿童也编为军队去充当炮灰。再看那时回民的宗教信仰吧，那时人民的宗教信仰也是经常受到迫害的，清真寺的教长、阿訇、满拉经常不能安心从事自己的宗教职业，有些清真寺也要出苛捐杂税，也要给马步芳雇壮丁，有些清真寺将每年信教群众送的布施和粮食完全交了苛捐杂税和雇了壮丁，逼得阿訇生活无法维持，只好离开寺院。还有个时期因壮丁紧张，连清真寺的满拉都整编成军队。更残痛的是反动统治阶级当时制造民族矛盾，各地经常发生民族之间、民族内部和教派纠纷，有时发生后闹得头破血流，家破人亡，整村整乡长期无法生产。所有上述这种种凄惨痛苦的生活，简直三天三夜也说不完，而这些惨痛的生活经历每一个人都是不会忘记的。
    今天的好日子是哪里来的？
    一九四九年终于到来了，全国各族人民在中国共产党、毛主席的领导下，推翻了国民党反动统治，赶走了蒋马匪帮，从此各族人民才永远摆脱了那些苦难的日月，才见天日了。解放后，共产党和人民政府实行民族平等团结政策，在少数民族地区实行了民族区域自治。根据宗教信仰自由政策，尊重和保护了宗教寺院和信教群众的宗教活动。几年来在共产党和人民政府的领导下，我们回民和其他民族一起进行了土改、镇反、抗美援朝、“三反”、“五反”等各项运动，各族人民的认识提高了，民族之间和民族内部的纠纷已基本绝迹，民族团结大大增强了，并且在这些工作基础上，基本上完成了社会主义改造，百分之九十以上的回民和其他民族一起共同组织了民族联合社，使民族团结已有了稳固的基础。现在各民族在一起共同劳动，团结友爱，亲如一家人。几年来经过五大运动和社会主义改造及其他各项政策的正确贯彻，农业生产已有了相当发展，各族人民的生活已有了相当改善，购买力与一九四九年相比，提高了两倍左右，过去有时连粗粮也吃不到的，现在还能吃到白面，过去群众穿的多是粗褐子或至多是粗斜布，现在则许多人都能穿到细卡机布。解放前，过尔德节煎油果的只是很少的富裕家庭，现在过尔德节则普遍都煎油果子，而且尔德节一年比一年过得丰盛。这一切与蒋马匪帮统治时期相比，真是天地之别。而这一切如何得来的呢？是由于共产党领导各族人民走社会主义得来的。如果没有共产党的领导，没有社会主义道路，要想少数民族有今天，决不可能。
    但是，奇怪的是最近那些资产阶级右派分子竟抹煞共产党领导的伟大功绩，大肆向共产党和各族人民进攻，甚至暗中组织联盟，企图取消共产党的领导，推翻人民民主专政，不要各族人民走社会主义道路，这种违反全国各族人民意志的狂妄想法是决不可能得逞的。各族人民的眼睛是雪亮的，一定不会被资产阶级右派分子的谬论所迷惑。我代表青海地区的回族表示：我们要坚决反对资产阶级右派分子的这种谬论，要坚决的粉碎资产阶级右派分子这种阴谋，并要今后进一步在共产党和人民政府的领导下，团结各族人民坚决地走社会主义道路。
