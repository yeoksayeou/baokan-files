Announcement Regarding Earlier Publication Time

Joint Announcement by People's Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Workers' Daily, China Youth Daily, Beijing Daily, Guangming Daily, Xinhua News Agency, Beijing Postal Bureau

    Recently, the publication time of newspapers has been very late, seriously affecting the time for the post office to deliver newspapers and for readers to read them. In order to enable readers in the Beijing urban area (inner city and outer suburbs) to read the newspapers around 8:00 AM, and to allow newspapers for other cities to catch the earliest train possible, People's Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Workers' Daily, China Youth Daily, Beijing Daily, Guangming Daily, Xinhua News Agency, and the Beijing Postal Bureau held a meeting and agreed that: starting from July 5th, all newspapers will be published earlier (printing to begin before 4:00 AM), and this will be trialed from July 1st. Therefore, if any departments have manuscripts that urgently need to be published the next day, they should all be sent to the respective newspaper offices and Xinhua News Agency before 10:00 PM starting from July 1st; the deadline for manuscripts sent by Xinhua News Agency to various newspaper offices is 12:30 AM. Manuscripts exceeding these times will be postponed for publication by one day.

    关于提早出报时间的启事
    人民日报、大公报、工人日报、中国青年报、北京日报、光明日报、新华通讯社、北京市邮局联合启事
    最近一个时期，报纸的出版时间很晚，严重地影响了邮局送报和读者看报的时间。为了使北京市区（城内及关厢）读者能在八点钟左右读到报纸，并使外埠报纸尽可能赶上最早的一班火车，人民日报、大公报、工人日报、中国青年报、北京日报、光明日报、新华通讯社同北京市邮局开会协议：从7月5日起一律提早出版（四点钟以前开印），并从7月1日起试行。为此，各部门如有急于要在第二天见报的稿件，从7月1日开始应一律于夜十时前发到各报社和新华社；新华社发给各报社的稿件在夜十二时半截稿。超过以上时间的稿件，一律推迟一天发表。
