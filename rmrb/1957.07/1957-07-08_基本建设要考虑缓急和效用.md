    Basic Construction Must Consider Urgency and Effectiveness
    Cheng Shifan
    This meeting is the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress, which means that the term of the current People's Representatives is coming to an end. I deeply regret that during my term, I have not adequately reflected the opinions of the people to the government in a timely manner. At this meeting, I intend to reflect some opinions of the people of our province (Anhui) on national basic construction for the government's reference.

    Doing Eighty Years' Worth of Work in Eight Years
    Speaking of the construction achievements and speed of New China, everyone at home and abroad is full of praise, and even imperialist countries cannot help but be shocked. Among these countries, many hostile and contemptuous "representatives" and "reporters," after visiting New China, could not help but admit that they had discovered unexpected miracles: the completion of the socialist revolution was unexpectedly fast; industrial construction was unexpectedly rapid; life was unexpectedly good; the people were unexpectedly united and energetic… This is indeed the case. Not to mention the whole country, let's take Anhui's industry as an example. In the past, its foundation was the weakest. At the time of liberation in 1949, there were only a few old factories and mines, with extremely simple equipment and very backward production methods. In the past few years, not only have all the old factories and mines received at the time been restored and transformed, but also many new factories and mines have been built. In 1956 alone, 50 new factories were put into production. The province's total industrial output value rose to 659% of that in 1950, and dozens of new industrial products were successfully manufactured and trial-produced. In short, in this short period of eight years, the government has done what was not done in the previous eighty years, or even longer. As a Chinese person, I am very satisfied and approve of this.

    However, it is impossible for all construction undertakings to satisfy everyone and leave no room for opinions. Especially socialist construction, which is completely new to us, must be modified in the process of exploration and learn lessons from failures. Therefore, the emergence of some errors and shortcomings is also understandable. What are the current shortcomings in construction? That is, some construction lacks long-term plans and comprehensive perspectives, focusing only on the present and neglecting the future; focusing on one aspect and neglecting the other; some construction is too hasty, while some things that should be done have not been done. Let me give two examples!

    Forestry Should Have Foresight
    First, the issue of timber harvesting. The state needs to harvest a large amount of timber every year for construction needs. At that time, the masses were also very willing to harvest and transport a large amount of timber for their livelihood needs, and to have work to do. Therefore, when logging, they often only considered the needs of the moment, logging without a plan, ignoring selective retention, and not asking how the future would be. If we continue to log at the scale of the province's large-scale logging last year and the estimated reduced logging of 450,000 cubic meters this year, the available timber forests in the Dabie Mountains and Huangshan areas of the province will be cut down in no more than seven or eight years. As for the newly planted forests, not only are the quantity and quality far from sufficient, but even with the fastest afforestation, it will take at least twenty-five years for them to grow into usable pine and fir timber forests, and forty years to become large timber. May I ask: In these seventeen to thirty-two years of "transition," can the country do without timber? Can some construction projects be put on hold due to insufficient timber? Is it possible to regulate the climate, conserve water sources, and prevent natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and sand without relying on forests? Is it possible not to improve the living standards of the people in mountainous areas who depend on this for their livelihoods? (They are already worried now.) It is absolutely impossible. Therefore, I suggest that the state should consider the total amount of existing usable timber forests in the country and the amount of timber needed for a considerable period of time, determine the annual logging volume, and coordinate with the forestry departments of various provinces and regions to strengthen afforestation work as soon as possible, so as to take both the near and the far into account and overcome the contradiction of "transition" in the future; otherwise, we will commit a historical error.

    Flood Control Cannot Rely Solely on Reservoirs
    Second, the issue of water management. "We must harness the Huai River well" is Chairman Mao's call. In recent years, the governments of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces have been working hard towards this goal, and have therefore made considerable achievements. In Anhui alone, from 1950 to the spring of 1956, more than 1.5 billion cubic meters of earthwork had been completed. Not only have river courses and embankments been repaired and ditches excavated, but also four large reservoirs have been built at Foziling, Meishan, Xianghongdian, and Mozitan. Among them, Foziling and Meishan have been completed successively, and Xianghongdian and Mozitan reservoirs are also planned to play a flood control role this year. Based on my personal experience, to build a reservoir in the marginal mountainous area of a watershed, it is necessary to first vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work, and at the same time open up downstream irrigation canals, so as to fully exert the flood control, irrigation, and power generation functions of the reservoir. Moreover, the watershed controlled by reservoirs in marginal mountainous areas is not large. If it rains above the reservoir, it will inevitably rain below the reservoir. If the center of the rain is in the downstream plain, the reservoir will not only not play a flood control role, but also will not be able to reduce waterlogging disasters. The characteristic of the Huai River is that the plain area is large. Therefore, although several mountainous reservoirs have been built, waterlogging disasters are still serious. Mountain valley reservoirs can only block part of the mountain water (mountain floods can be divided into various small valley dams to alleviate them), but cannot block the water in the plain. Historically, the Huai River has been breached and diverted to the sea by the Yellow River many times, and has overflowed, with the southeastern part of Henan and the northern part of Anhui and Jiangsu provinces covered by the mud and sand carried each time, turning the fertile land into barren land. Most of the main and tributary streams are silted up, the water flow is not smooth, the riverbeds are filled too high, and there are no fixed small tributaries and ditch banks. Most of the original lakes have also been silted up and shrunk, and the water storage capacity is extremely small. Therefore, there is the current situation of great disasters in heavy rain, small disasters in light rain, and drought disasters in no rain. I would like to ask the government to consider allocating a portion of funds from this year and the second plan to dredge some of the main and tributary streams and excavate a large number of large and small ditches and sluices to form a water network similar to that of southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang. The function of the water network should be able to store a large amount of rainwater during the rainy season, not only to prevent waterlogging disasters, but also to evenly retain water in the plain. Wouldn't it be as beautiful as the two crops of rice and wheat in the plains of southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang?

    What the people of northern Anhui hope for most now is to avoid waterlogging disasters and harvest more grain. The government can also avoid disaster relief every year. Although the masses are grateful to the government for disaster relief every year, they always feel that it is not as good as what they get from their own labor.

    Therefore, I would like to suggest that the government, in planning to control the harm of the Yellow River and develop its water conservancy, should consider two points when building dams across the river:

    Prioritize Soil and Water Conservation
    First, prioritize soil and water conservation work, and immediately, continuously, and conscientiously start doing a variety of soil and water conservation work. Otherwise, after the dams across the river are built, the reservoirs on the main and tributary streams will easily be silted up and filled with mud and sand washed down from the Loess Plateau, losing their effectiveness. The Sanmenxia project, which has already started and is such a large-scale comprehensive water conservancy hub, requires an investment of more than 1 billion yuan. According to the current situation of soil and water loss, I personally think that it can only maintain a lifespan of twenty to thirty years, which is incomprehensible. I would like to suggest that the government postpone the construction of dams in a planned way, allocate a portion of the huge investment funds and send a large team of manpower down to help the people in the area to rush to do a variety of soil and water conservation work, and at the same time vigorously carry out publicity work, so that the people know the importance of this work, which is not only beneficial to themselves, but also of great benefit to the entire country. It is necessary to adopt the method of public assistance and private management, explaining that it mainly relies on the strength of the masses, and the government only strives to help in economic and technical aspects, and it is necessary to ensure that the masses are consciously and willingly effective.

    Suggestions on Building Dams Across the River
    Second, the main spirit of the plan is to build 46 dams across the main stream of the Yellow River, turning the Yellow River into a terraced river, and making it possible for the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River to be fully navigable, so that 500-ton tugboats can sail from the estuary to Lanzhou, greatly improving the transportation situation in the Yellow River basin. However, I think that most of the 46 dams will be dozens of meters high, and the difference in water level above and below the Sanmenxia dam will be as high as 90 meters. If ordinary ship locks are built in such dams, or a series of stepped ship locks or a deep-well ship lock is built, the construction project will be very large, difficult, and not very practical. I would like to suggest using a very ordinary and simple method. This method is to build two inclined planes, upper and lower, at one end of the dam or select a suitable part. The inclined plane can be made of stone or reinforced concrete, and the slope can be made gentler. At the junction of the two inclined planes, that is, at the top of the dam, leave a plane 30 meters long and 30 meters wide. The width of the inclined plane itself is also 30 meters. Divide the plane and the inclined plane into two halves, one for winding up the water boat and the other for winding down the water boat. Each side should be equipped with two electric motors, and each motor should be directly installed with a winch drum, which is used to wind the steel wire rope to wind the boat up or down (detailed illustrations are not detailed here). However, I suggest that when building each dam, the appropriate method of passing ships should be carefully considered at the same time, and the location for building ship locks or inclined planes should be determined, and should not be ignored, so as to achieve the goal proposed in the comprehensive plan for governing the Yellow River that 500-ton tugboats can sail from the estuary to Lanzhou.

    In short, I hope that those who are in charge of basic construction work will carefully consider the priority, importance, and effectiveness of various basic construction projects, and make overall plans to take both the near and the far into account. If the investment is appropriate, even if the money is small, it can be used to its full potential and achieve twice the result with half the effort.

    Whether the above opinions are appropriate or not, please criticize and correct them.

    基本建设要考虑缓急和效用
    程士范
    这次会议是全国人民代表大会第一届第四次会议，这就意味着本届人民代表的任期将满。本人深愧在任职期间代表人民及时向政府反映意见不够。此次会上，拟将本省（安徽）人民对国家基本建设的点滴意见反映出来，供政府参考。
    八年做了八十年的事情
    谈到新中国的建设成就与速度，国内国外，莫不赞扬，甚至帝国主义国家，也不能不为之震惊，这些国家中，许多怀着敌意和轻视的“代表”“记者们”，在访问过新中国后，也不能不承认他们发现了意料之外的奇迹：社会主义革命的完成意料之外的快；工业建设意料之外的迅速；生活意料之外的美好；人民意料之外的团结、有劲……。事实确是如此，且不说全国，就以安徽工业来说，过去基础最微弱。一九四九年解放时仅有几处陈旧的厂矿，设备极简陋，生产方式极落后。几年来，不仅恢复改造了原接收的一切破旧厂矿，而且新建了许多新型工厂、矿山，仅1956年即有五十个新建厂投入生产，全省工业总产值上升为1950年的659％，新制和试制成功的工业产品达数十种。总之，在这短短八年时刻里，政府做了以前八十年，甚至更长期内没有做到的事情。作为一个中国人，我非常满意和赞成。
    但是，一切建设事业要使群众都满意，没有意见，那也是不可能的。特别是社会主义建设，对我们来说是毫无经验，必须在摸索的过程中修改，在失败中吸取教训。因此，一些错误和缺点的产生也是无可厚非的。目前建设中的缺点是什么呢？即某些建设缺乏长远打算和全面观点，只顾眼前，忽视将来；顾此一面，忽视另一面；有些建设冒进了，而有些该做的又没有做起来。仅举两件事为例！
    伐木造林要有远见
    第一、木材的采伐问题。国家为了建设需要，每年都得采伐大量木材。当时群众为了生活需要，有工作做，也很愿意采伐和运送大量木材。因此，伐木时往往只顾眼前需要，无计划的采伐，不顾分别留养，不问往后日子如何？照本省去年大量采伐和今年已酌减的预计采伐四十五万立方公尺的规模伐下去，就本省大别山区和黄山区的可用木材林，不要七八年就要砍光了。而新造的林呢！不仅数量质量远不敷用，就是尽快的造林，要等它先成长为可用的松杉木材林，起码也得要二十五年才可成中材，四十年才可成大材。试问：在这“青黄不接”的十七至三十二年中，国家可不可以不用木材呢？可不可以因木材不够而把某些建设摆下来呢？调节气候，涵养水源，防止水、旱、风、沙等自然灾害，不靠森林行不行呢？山区靠此为生的人民生活水平不提高行不行呢？（现在他们已经在发愁了）决不可以。所以，建议国家应从全国现有可用木材林的总量和相当长时期内木材的需用量，两方面来考虑，确定逐年的伐木量。并配合各省区林业厅及早加强造林工作，做到远近兼顾，以克服今后“青黄不接”的矛盾，否则将要犯历史性的错误。
    防涝不能只靠水库
    第二、治水问题。“一定要把淮河修好”这是毛主席的号召。几年来，豫、皖、苏省政府都在循此目标努力，因此取得不少成绩。仅安徽一九五○年至一九五六年春，已做土方十五亿余公方。不仅修整了河道、堤防，开挖了沟壑，而且修建了佛子岭、梅山、响洪甸、磨子潭四处大型水库，其中佛、梅已先后建成，响、磨水库也计划今年起拦洪作用。根据我个人体会，在一个流域的边缘山区筑水库，需要先行大力开展水土保持工作，同时开采下游灌溉渠道，才能充分发挥水库的拦洪、灌溉和发电等作用。且边缘山区水库控制流域面不大，水库以上下雨，下游不能不下雨，若雨的中心在下游平原内，水库不但不能起杀洪作用，更不能减免涝灾。淮河的特点是平原面积大，故虽已修筑了几个山区水库，而涝灾仍然严重，盖山谷水库，只能拦部分山水（山洪可分做各种小型谷坊来减轻），不能拦平原之水。淮河历史上经过多次黄河决口夺淮入海和泛溢，豫之东南部及皖苏之北部，并每次所挟带泥沙，淹盖了该部分肥沃土地使变成瘦瘠。干支流大部淤塞，水流不畅，各河身淤填过高，且无固定小支流、沟滨，原有湖泊也大都淤填缩小，容水量极微，因此成大雨大灾，小雨小灾，无雨旱灾的危害现状。不如请政府从今年起及第二个计划考虑先拨一部分款项作疏浚部分干支流及大量开挖大小沟渠和水闸，形成似苏南浙北之水网。水网作用要能达到暴雨季节能贮藏大量雨水，不但要使不成涝灾，并且能将水均匀的留在平原之内，岂有不能像苏南浙北平原之稻麦两熟之美吗？
    目前淮北人民所最仰望者，能免涝灾，多收粮食。政府也可免年年救灾。年年救灾，群众对政府虽然感激，但总觉得不如从自己劳动得来的好。
    因此，我想建议政府对根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的规划，在修筑拦河坝时，要考虑两点：
    抢先做好水土保持工作
    一、抢先做好水土保持工作，立即地、长期地、切实地着手做多种多样的水土保持工作，否则拦河坝筑成后，干流、支流上的水库是很容易被由黄土区冲刷下来的泥沙淤填满而丧失其效用的。现在已经动工的三门峡这样大型的综合水利枢纽，要投资十多亿元，按现在的水土流失情况，我个人想也只不过能维持二十至三十年的寿命，这是不可理解的事。我想建议政府对修建拦河工程作有计划的从缓，拨一部分的巨额投资款项及派大队人力下去帮助该区人民抢做多种多样的水土保持工作，同时要大力做好宣传工作，使人民知道这项工作的重要性不但对他们自身有益，对整个国家也有莫大益处，要以公助民办的方式，说明主要靠人民群众的力量，政府只在经济及技术方面努力帮助，务必要使人民群众自觉自愿的才能收效。
    对修建拦河坝的建议
    二、规划之主要精神是在黄河干流中建筑四十六座拦河坝，把黄河变成一条梯河，并使黄河中、下游可以全线通航，五百吨拖船能由海口航行至兰州，使黄河流域交通运输状况得到很大改善。但我想到四十六座拦河坝大部分的坝高要达数十公尺，三门峡拦河坝上下水面相差要达九十公尺高，若在这样的拦河坝中建筑普通船闸，或建立连续几座梯形船闸，或建立一种深井式船闸，对建筑工程均非常浩大，而困难且不太实用。我想建议用一较非常平凡而简单的办法。这种办法是在拦河坝一端或选定一适宜部分建筑上下两个斜面，斜面可以用石料砌成或用钢筋混凝土造成，坡度可造得平缓一些。在两斜面衔接处即坝顶部留一三十公尺长和三十公尺宽的平面，斜面本身宽度亦为三十公尺。把平面和斜面都各分两半，一半备绞上水船用，一半备绞下水船用。每面各要装电马达两座，每座马达上直接安装一部绞车辊筒，用以绞卷钢丝绳把船绞上或放下（详细图说不在这里细讲了）。不过我建议在建筑每一座拦河坝时，同时应该将适当的过船办法考虑周详，划定建筑船闸或斜面的地位，不要忽略，以求达到治理黄河综合规划中所提出的五百吨拖船能自海口航行到兰州的目的。
    总之，希望掌握基建工作者，要慎重考虑各色各样的基本建设的轻重缓急，效用大小和通盘筹划兼顾远景。投资得当，钱虽少，也能运用裕余，得到事半功倍的效果。
    以上意见，是否有当，请诸位批判指正。
