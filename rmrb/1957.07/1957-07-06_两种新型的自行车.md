Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 5th: The Tianjin Bicycle Factory successfully trial-produced two new types of bicycles in June that had not been produced domestically before. One is a 14-inch travel bicycle that can be folded and carried by hand. Although its wheels are half the size of ordinary Flying Pigeon brand bicycles, it still rides quickly because its chainring is larger and its freewheel is smaller. The other bicycle, although it cannot be folded, has handlebars and a seat that can be adjusted according to people's needs, so it is suitable for both men and women, adults and children. A total of five of these two types of bicycles were made, each weighing about 30 jin.

Currently, the factory is soliciting opinions on these two types of bicycles in order to determine the production quantity based on market needs.

    两种新型的自行车
    新华社天津5日电　天津自行车厂在6月份试制成功两种国内还没有生产过的新型自行车。一种是可以折叠起来提在手里的十四吋旅行式自行车，虽然它的轮子比普通飞鸽牌自行车小一半，但因为它的轮盘较大，飞轮较小，因此骑起来仍然很快。另一种自行车，虽然不能折叠，但它的车把、车鞍子，可以按照人们的需要进行调剂，因此，能适合男女、大人小孩骑用。这两种自行车共制成五辆，每辆净重三十斤左右。
    目前工厂正在征求对这两种自行车的意见，以便根据市场需要，决定生产数量。
