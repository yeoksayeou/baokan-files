Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 23rd: The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting of secretaries of prefectural and municipal committees from the 16th to the 18th, proposing that the current policy for rural work in Fujian Province is to further strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, launch a mass-based production increase campaign, strive for a bumper autumn grain harvest, and strive to fulfill the annual agricultural production plan.

The meeting believed that since the provincial committee's enlarged meeting in February, most rural grassroots organizations have undergone democratic rectification and socialist education, the democratic work style of cadres has been strengthened, and participation in and leadership of production has initially become the norm; the policy of democratic management of cooperatives has also been further implemented, thus improving the relationship between the Party and the masses, and boosting the production enthusiasm of the broad masses. However, since the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, insufficient leadership has been devoted to production, and some grassroots leaders have exhibited a negative attitude of being afraid to lead. Therefore, the provincial committee decided to immediately further strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, with the provincial and prefectural levels dedicating more effort than in the past to leading production work; leadership organs at and below the county level should go all out to improve rural production. The meeting pointed out that carrying out class education in the anti-Rightist struggle among the broad grassroots cadres and peasants in rural areas has become an important driving force for promoting current rural production work. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to deeply conduct class education against the Rightists in rural areas, so that the broad grassroots cadres and peasants can further recognize the current situation and the nature of the struggle, as well as their responsibilities in the anti-Rightist struggle, in order to use practical actions in carrying out various tasks, especially production work, to counter the rampant attacks of bourgeois Rightist elements. It is necessary to educate cadres and peasants to heighten their vigilance, expose and resolutely crack down on the heinous activities of some landlords, rich peasants, and remnant counter-revolutionaries to restore their power. All levels of political and legal organs should strengthen the socialist legal system, protect the fruits of the peasants' liberation and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

The meeting pointed out that the unit area yield of early rice has mostly exceeded last year's; intermediate and late rice are also mostly growing well, and a bumper harvest is expected; diversified economy and sideline production have also achieved great development. However, due to the reduction of early rice planting area in some areas, and natural disasters in some areas, the total grain output in the first half of the year may be less than the same period last year, but better than normal years' harvests. Therefore, striving for a bumper autumn harvest is of great significance for striving to fulfill the annual agricultural production plan and consolidating cooperatives. The meeting believed that as long as leadership is strengthened, the critical period of July and August is seized, and all tasks are carried out conscientiously, a bumper autumn harvest is hopeful.

The meeting believed that consolidating cooperatives is directly related to striving for a bumper autumn harvest. While doing a good job in production, it is necessary to vigorously improve the consolidation of cooperatives. The main tasks currently are: First, conscientiously carry out summer harvest distribution, especially grain distribution, so that national grain procurement, cooperative members' rations, and livestock feed can be guaranteed; Second, continue to improve democratic management of cooperatives, currently mainly establishing and improving the system of members' representative meetings, and fully utilizing the role of veteran peasant technical advisory committees; Third, continue to implement the policy of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives and managing households; Fourth, further implement mutually beneficial policies, repay price reductions and interest on time, and the wasteland reclaimed by cooperative members themselves this year can be used as cooperative members' private plots; Fifth, strengthen education on the superiority of cooperativization for cooperative members, and actively solve existing problems.

    为了完成全年农业生产计划
    福建省决定加强生产领导开展增产运动
    新华社福州23日电　中共福建省委在16日到18日召开地、市委书记会议，提出福建省当前农村工作的方针是：进一步加强农业生产的领导，开展群众性的增产运动，力争秋季粮食大丰收，争取完成全年农业生产计划。
    会议认为，自2月省委扩大会议以后，大部农村基层组织进行了民主整风整社，干部民主作风加强了，参加生产和领导生产已初成风气；民主办社的方针也得到进一步贯彻，因而党群关系有所改善，广大群众生产情绪高涨。但自整风和反右派斗争以来生产领导力量投放不足，有些基层领导干部存在不敢领导的消极情绪。因此省委决定立即进一步加强对农业生产的领导，省、地两级要以比过去更多的力量来领导生产工作；县以下各级领导机关要全力以赴搞好农村生产。会议指出，在广大农村基层干部和农民中进行反右派斗争的阶级教育，已成为推动作好当前农村生产工作的重要动力。因此，继续在农村中深入进行反右派的阶级教育，使广大基层干部和农民进一步认清当前形势和斗争性质以及自己在反右派斗争中的责任，以作好各项工作，特别是生产工作的实际行动，反击资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻。要教育干部和农民提高警惕，揭露和坚决打击有些地主、富农和残余反革命分子复辟的罪恶活动。各级政法机关应加强社会主义的法制工作，保卫农民的翻身果实和农业合作社的巩固。
    会议指出，早稻单位面积产量大都超过去年；中稻、晚稻也大部生长良好，可望丰收；多种经济和副业生产也获得很大发展。但因部分地区早稻种植面积减少，部分地区遭受自然灾害等，上半年粮食总产量可能比去年同季减少，但比正常年景的收成还要好。因此力争秋季大丰收对争取完成全年农业生产计划和巩固合作社有重大意义。会议认为只要加强领导，抓紧7、8月份的关键时期，切实做好各项工作，秋季大丰收是有希望的。
    会议认为，整顿和巩固合作社对争取秋季大丰收有直接关系。在做好生产工作的同时，要大力搞好巩固合作社工作，当前主要做好以下几件事：一、认真做好夏收分配，特别是粮食分配，使国家粮食征购、社员口粮、牲畜饲料都能得到保证；二、继续搞好民主办社，目前主要是建立和健全社员代表大会制度，以及充分发挥老农技术顾问委员会的作用；三、继续贯彻勤俭办社和勤俭治家的方针；四、进一步贯彻互利政策，按期偿还折价和利息，社员今年自己开的荒地，可作为社员自留地；五、加强对社员的合作化优越性的教育，积极解决好现存的问题。
