    Strengthen the unity of the socialist forces led by the Soviet Union.
    Many fraternal parties from various countries support the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee.
    The central leading bodies or leaders of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Albania, Italy, France, Austria, Japan, and Israel have issued resolutions or statements on the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov. The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party also wrote a letter expressing support for the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session.
    The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany issued a statement on the 4th, saying, "The Politburo welcomes the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee." The statement continued, "This resolution is an expression of the Marxist-Leninist unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and guarantees the consistent implementation of the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany wholeheartedly and unconditionally supports the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU."
    The resolution passed by the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party stated that the Hungarian Party Central Committee agrees with the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee to expose and eliminate the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov, and welcomes the CPSU Central Committee's determination to defend the unity of the Party and to defend the political line based on the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU. This is an effective help for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party to further consolidate the unity of the Party and oppose attacks from any direction.
    The communique issued by the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party on July 4 stated: "The Albanian Party Central Committee fully agrees with the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and unanimously condemns the anti-Party and sectarian activities of the Malenkov-Kaganovich-Molotov group." The plenary session also passed a letter to the CPSU Central Committee, stating that the Albanian Labor Party, while consolidating the unity of its ranks, will continue to fight for the further unity of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and for the unity of the international communist movement.
    In a letter to the CPSU Central Committee on the 6th, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party expressed full support for and agreement with the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session. The letter stated: The Korean Workers' Party will make every effort to further strengthen the unity with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, defend the friendship between the people of Korea and the Soviet Union, and further strengthen the internationalist unity of the socialist camp centered on the Soviet Union.
    Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti issued a statement saying that the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee "involves a series of issues that are of extreme importance not only to the Communist Parties of various countries, but also to the entire labor movement and people's movement. What is being referred to here is the political line adopted by the 20th Congress of the CPSU and put forward to the entire international workers' movement." He continued, "We have always firmly supported this policy." He also said, "The CPSU Central Committee has solemnly affirmed its political line. Insisting on the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, insisting on implementing these resolutions in all aspects, and insisting on destroying all resistance against doing so will only achieve greater results."
    The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a resolution on the 4th, stating that the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee is extremely important not only for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but also for the entire international communist workers' movement. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party is confident that it expresses the feelings of the entire French Communist Party, the working class, the working peasants, and the advanced intellectuals, expresses its complete agreement with the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee, and announces its solidarity with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee. The resolution also called on members of the French Communist Party to discuss the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee and to engage in activities to defend peace, strive for the realization of demands, strive for freedom, strive for socialism, strive for the unity of the working class, and strive for the unity of all democratic forces in accordance with it.
    At a meeting held on the 4th, the members of the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party listened to a report by Feinberg, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Austrian Communist Party, on the resolution of the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, and unanimously supported the decision of the CPSU Central Committee. After condemning sectarian activities, Feinberg emphasized that the unbreakable unity of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is not only of great significance for the future communist construction of the Soviet Union, but also for the entire international workers' movement and for the struggle of the world for peace and progress.
    The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the 4th, saying that the resolution of the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session proves that the CPSU has achieved its new unity and the strengthening of collective leadership. The statement also said that the Japanese Communist Party, which is facing the upcoming Seventh Party Congress, must learn this lesson to strengthen Party unity and must pay serious attention to anti-Party activities that undermine Party discipline.
    The resolution passed by the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Israel stated "complete support for the resolution of the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the CPSU," and pointed out that, from the perspective of the international influence of this resolution, it is of great help to the struggle of the people of the Middle East countries—including Israel—for peace and national independence.

    7月4日举行的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会全体会议发表的公报说：“阿尔巴尼亚党中央全会完全赞同苏共中央的决议，并且一致谴责马林科夫—卡冈诺维奇—莫洛托夫集团的反党和宗派活动。”全会还通过了致苏共中央的信，表示阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在巩固自己队伍的团结的同时，将继续为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量的进一步团结、为国际共产主义运动的团结而斗争。
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会6日在写给苏共中央的信中表示完全支持和赞同苏共中央全会的决议。这封信说：朝鲜劳动党将尽一切力量来进一步加强同苏联共产党的团结，保卫朝苏人民之间的友谊和进一步加强以苏联为中心的社会主义阵营的国际主义团结。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂发表的声明说，苏共中央的决议“涉及一系列的问题，这些问题不仅对各国共产党，而且对整个工人运动和人民运动，都具有极其重大的意义。这里所说的就是，为苏共二十次代表大会所通过、并向整个国际工人运动提出的政治方针。”他接着说：“我们始终坚决拥护这一方针。”他还说：“苏共中央郑重地肯定了自己的政治方针。坚持苏共二十次代表大会的决议，坚持在各方面贯彻这些决议，坚持摧毁反对这样作的一切反抗，这样只会收到更大的成效。”
    法国共产党中央委员会4日发布决议说，苏共中央的决议不仅对于苏联共产党、而且对于整个国际共产主义工人运动都是极其重要的。法共中央自信表达了法国共产党全党、工人阶级、劳动农民和先进知识分子的感情，对苏共中央的决议表示完全同意，并且宣布同苏联共产党和它的中央委员会精诚团结。决议还号召法共党员讨论苏共中央的决议，并且根据它从事保卫和平、争取实现要求、争取自由、争取社会主义、争取工人阶级团结、争取一切民主力量团结的活动。
    奥地利共产党中央委员会的委员在4日举行的会议上听取了奥共中央政治局委员费恩伯关于苏共中央全会决议的报告后，一致拥护苏共中央的决定。费恩伯谴责了宗派活动后强调指出，苏联共产党的牢不可破的团结不仅对苏联今后的共产主义建设有十分重要的意义，而且也对整个国际工人运动、对全世界争取和平和进步的斗争有十分重要的意义。
    日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会4日发表的声明说，苏共中央全会的决议证明，苏共已经达到了它的新的团结和集体领导的加强。声明又说，正面临着将要召开第七次党代表大会的日本共产党，必须学习这个教训来加强党的团结，并且要严重地注意破坏党的纪律的反党活动。
    以色列共产党中央委员会全体会议通过的决议表示“完全拥护苏共中央全会的决议”，并且指出，从这一决议的国际影响来看，它对中东各国——其中包括以色列——的人民争取和平和民族独立的斗争，有很大的帮助。
