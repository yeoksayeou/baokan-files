Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 30th - Members of the Che'tian Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtian Township, Anfu County, Jiangxi Province, gathered on the evening of June 24th to refute the fallacies of bourgeois rightists against socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party, and exposed Luo Longji's reactionary words and deeds in his hometown.

Fengtian Township is Luo Longji's hometown. The cooperative members revealed that when Luo Longji returned home the summer before last, he did not ask what benefits the farmers had gained under the leadership of the Party. Instead, he deliberately looked for loopholes, and when talking to others, he always asked with ulterior motives: "What's wrong with collectivization?" and "What's wrong with unified purchase and sale?"

Zhou Shou-cai, a cooperative cadre, said that as soon as Luo Longji returned home, he went to the house of Luo Mu-zeng (Luo Longji's third elder brother), an illegal and tyrannical landlord. He didn't go out to understand the situation but just listened to his sister-in-law. He summoned me and said fiercely: "Why are the people left with nothing to eat?" In fact, every family in the village had grain to eat. At that time, Luo Longji wanted to see the warehouse, which was the property of the people of the whole country and included his share. He deliberately sarcastically said, "Is it okay to borrow your warehouse for a look?"

The cooperative members also revealed Luo Longji's words and deeds in maintaining the families of illegal landlords during the land reform, and that he had always harbored resentment towards the farmers' just actions. Luo Longji's third elder brother, Luo Mu-zeng, relied on collecting rent to exploit the farmers before liberation. He served as a puppet township representative and relied on Luo Longji's influence to extort and blackmail everywhere, occupying twenty-five mu of civilian land alone. The masses hated him to the bone, and he was classified as a tyrannical landlord during the land reform. Luo Longji instructed his younger brother, Luo Zhao-rui, to write a letter from Beijing to the township government threatening: "On what grounds did you classify Luo Mu-zeng as a landlord and confiscate his property? A reply is required quickly." During the land reform, the farmers struggled against Luo Longji's sister-in-law and confiscated her gold and silver during the calculation of exploitation debts. When Luo Longji returned home the year before last, he questioned cooperative cadre Zhou Shou-cai: "You say that the small-scale peasant economy is difficult to fathom, and there may be deviations in the unified purchase and sale of individual households. But how is it that so much gold and silver could be dug out when the landlords' property was confiscated during the land reform?" Cooperative member Zhou Bo-gen said, "It is clear from this that Luo Longji's call for the establishment of a committee without the leadership of the Communist Party, to 'redress grievances' and 'rehabilitate' counter-revolutionaries, is intended to release his gang of foxes and dogs to stir up trouble."

The cooperative members believe that the Party and the people of the whole country must be vigilant and must not allow the conspiracy of the bourgeois rightists to succeed, so as to safeguard our revolutionary achievements and build socialism well.

    罗隆基家乡的农民指责罗隆基包庇地主仇恨农民
    新华社南昌30日电　江西省安福县枫田乡车田农业社社员，在6月24日晚上集会，驳斥资产阶级右派分子反对社会主义、反对共产党领导的谬论，并揭发了罗隆基在家乡的反动言行。
    枫田乡是罗隆基的家乡。社员们揭露说，前年夏天，罗隆基回家时，根本不问农民在党的领导下得到了什么好处，却专门钻空子，和别人谈话时，总是别有用心地问：“搞合作化有什么不好？”，“统购统销有什么不好？”。
    社干部周受才说，罗隆基一回家就到不法的恶霸地主罗慕增（罗隆基的三哥）家去，也不出去了解情况，光听他嫂嫂说话，并把我找去凶凶地说：“为什么搞得老百姓没有吃？”其实，全村每家都有粮食吃。当时罗隆基要去看仓库，这本是全国人民的财产，也有他的一份；他却故意挖苦说：“借你们的仓库看行不行？”
    社员们还揭发了罗隆基在土地改革时维护不法地主家庭的言行，并且一直对农民的正义行动怀恨在心。罗隆基的三哥罗慕增，解放前靠收租谷剥削农民吃饭，做过伪乡民代表，并且依仗罗隆基的势力，到处敲诈勒索，光霸占的民田就有二十五亩，群众恨之入骨，土地改革时被划为恶霸地主。罗隆基竟指使他弟弟罗兆瑞从北京写信到乡政府威胁说：“你们划罗慕增的地主，并且没收他的财产，是根据什么条文，限赶快答复。”在土地改革中农民斗争了罗隆基的嫂嫂，并在算剥削账中没收了他嫂嫂的金银，罗隆基在前年回家时还质问社干部周受才说：“你说小农经济难摸底，统购统销个别户可能有偏差，而土地改革时没收地主财产，有多少金、银，为什么都能挖出来呢？”社员周伯根说：“从这里分明看出罗隆基叫喊要成立一个不要共产党领导的委员会，替反革命申‘冤’‘平反’，为的是要把他的狐群狗党放出来兴风作浪。”
    社员们认为：党和全国人民要提高警惕，千万不能让资产阶级右派分子的阴谋得逞，保卫我们的革命成果，把社会主义建设好。
