	Radio in a Steel Helmet
	The U.S. Army Department announced on June 8th that "a radio receiver installed in the middle of a steel helmet has been successfully trial-produced." The power source for this radio is solar energy. On sunny days, the solar energy is converted into electricity and directly supplied to the radio, allowing it to operate. If it encounters nighttime or rainy weather, it uses a device made of nickel and cadmium, specially designed to store solar energy, to power the radio.

    装在钢盔里的收音机
    美陆军部在6月8日宣布“一种装在钢盔中间的无线电收音机，已经试制成功”。这种收音机的电源是利用太阳能。晴天，太阳能变成的电力，直接输往收音机，让它进行工作。如果遇上夜间和下雨天气，它就利用一种用镍、镉制成，专门用来储存太阳能的设备，来开动收音机。
