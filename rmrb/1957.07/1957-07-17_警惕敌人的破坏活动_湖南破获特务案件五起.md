Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th - Hunan Province's public security organs have recently uncovered five cases of espionage dispatched by Chiang Kai-shek's spy agencies. The five main spies, Yan Houde, Zuo Cailin, Duan Hanxiang, Huang Shoushan, and Yao Gang, along with seven other spies they developed, have been arrested according to law.

Yan Houde, Zuo Cailin, Duan Hanxiang, Huang Shoushan, and Yao Gang all received training in Hong Kong at Kuomintang spy agencies in so-called "establishing a party behind enemy lines," "psychological warfare," as well as action sabotage, intelligence gathering, secret writing communication, and other espionage techniques. The spy agencies appointed Yan Houde as "Leader of the Second Group of the Southern Hunan Enemy-Occupied Area Organization Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee's Second Group," Huang Shoushan as "Intelligence Liaison Officer of the Kuomintang Central Committee's Second Group," Yao Gang as "Leader of the Hunan Youth Movement Liaison Group of the Kuomintang Central Committee's Second Group," Duan Hanxiang as "Correspondent of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense," and Zuo Cailin as "Hengyang Direct Reporting Spy of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense." They were given specific tasks and dispatched to the mainland to carry out sabotage activities.

Starting from July of last year, this group of spies carried a large amount of activity funds and secret writing reagents and infiltrated Changsha, Hengyang, and other places such as Chaling and Qidong. They lurked in urban and rural areas and along railway lines. The main tasks of Yan Houde, Huang Shoushan, and Duan Hanxiang were to develop spy organizations, recruit remaining counter-revolutionary forces, and carry out so-called "establishing a party behind enemy lines." They used various despicable means, through so-called "relatives and friends routes" and deceptive enticements, to develop members of the Three People's Principles Youth League like Liao Yuanzhuo, the family members of counter-revolutionaries like Zhou Shigen, reactionary military officers Xiao Qixun, Xiao Shuxun, and Huang Changshou, and landlord elements Zhang Xiuxi and Huang Dazhi in Chaling, Hengyang, Qidong, Shaoyang, and other places to join their spy organization. They also repeatedly collected intelligence for the Kuomintang spy agencies. At the same time, they spread counter-revolutionary rumors among some backward masses, boasting about the strength of the US and Chiang, provoking the relationship between the masses and the Party and the government, and undermining the government's various policies and decrees.

With the support and assistance of the people, the local public security organs, after in-depth investigation and careful reconnaissance, grasped the definite evidence of this group of spies. When the activities of Yan Houde, Huang Shoushan, and Duan Hanxiang were at their most rampant, they were arrested and brought to justice. Yao Gang accepted the task from the spy agency and sneaked into the mainland from Hong Kong, attempting to carry out so-called "youth movement liaison" activities in the mainland, but he was uncovered not long after he infiltrated Changsha. After the spy Zuo Cailin learned that Duan Hanxiang and other spies in the same system as him had been arrested, he fled in panic, but he was intercepted by the public security organs in time. The other seven spies were also captured one after another.

When the public security organs arrested this group of spies, they found more than 30 items in their residences and on their persons, including secret writing reagents, intelligence drafts, reactionary leaflets, and instructions from Kuomintang spy agencies, as well as a portion of the funds for espionage activities. Because the evidence was irrefutable, these spies could not deny it and have confessed to their crimes.

    警惕敌人的破坏活动
    湖南破获特务案件五起
    新华社长沙16日电　湖南省公安机关最近先后破获了五起蒋介石集团特务机关的派遣特务案件，主要的五名特务分子颜厚德、左才林、段翰香、黄守善、姚刚以及他们所发展的其他七名特务分子已经被依法逮捕。
    颜厚德、左才林、段翰香、黄守善、姚刚都在香港的国民党特务机关受过所谓“敌后建党”、“心理作战”以及行动破坏、情报搜集、密写通讯等特工技术训练。特务机关委派颜厚德为“国民党中委会二组湘南敌后组织部第二组组长”，黄守善为“国民党中委会二组情报联络员”，姚刚为“国民党中委会二组湖南青运联络组组长”，段翰香为“国防部二厅通讯员”，左才林为“国防部二厅衡阳直属谍报员”，并且向他们交代了具体的任务，把他们派遣到大陆进行破坏活动。
    这批特务分子从去年7月起携带大量活动经费和密写药剂等分别潜来长沙、衡阳及茶陵、祁东等地，分别潜伏在城市、农村和铁路沿线地区，颜厚德、黄守善、段翰香的主要任务是发展特务组织，搜罗残余反革命势力，进行所谓“敌后建党”。他们利用各种卑鄙手段，通过所谓“亲友路线”和欺骗利诱的办法，分别在茶陵、衡阳、祁东、邵阳等地发展了三青团分子廖远卓，反革命分子的家属周世根，反动军官萧奇勋、萧树勋、黄昌寿，地主分子张修溪、黄大志参加了他们的特务组织，还多次搜集情报供给国民党特务机关；同时，在某些落后群众中大肆散布反革命谣言，吹嘘美蒋实力，挑拨群众同党和政府的关系，破坏政府的各项政策法令。
    当地公安机关在人民群众的支持和协助下，经过深入的调查研究和周密侦察，掌握了这一批特务分子的确切罪证，当颜厚德、黄守善、段翰香的活动正在嚣张之际，就将他们分别逮捕归案。姚刚接受特务机关的任务从香港潜入大陆，妄图在内地开展所谓“青运联络”活动，但潜来长沙不久也被破获；特务分子左才林在知道和他同一系统的特务段翰香等已经被捕的消息后，仓皇逃遁，也为公安机关及时截获，其他七名特务分子也先后全部落网。
    公安机关在逮捕这批特务分子时，在他们的住处和身上共搜出了密写药剂、情报底稿、反动传单、国民党特务机关的指示文件等三十多件和特务活动经费一部。由于罪证确凿，抵赖不了，这些特务分子已经供认了他们的罪行。
