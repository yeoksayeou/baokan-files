Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 13th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Shi Zhengzhang reports: In the southern Anhui region, tens of thousands of cadres and farmers recently waged an extremely arduous struggle against extraordinary floods. Thanks to timely rescue efforts, they finally overcame the rare, extraordinary floods. Some disaster areas are now carrying out relief work.

At the beginning of July, the basins of the Qingyi River, Shui Du River, Qiupu River, Qingtong River, Langchuan River, and Zhang River in southern Anhui experienced concentrated heavy rainfall and mountain torrents, causing widespread river flooding and creating conditions like the 1954 floods. When the floods threatened the lives and property of the people along the rivers, party and government leaders at all levels led large numbers of cadres to critical locations to direct flood prevention and rescue work. In the counties south of the Yangtze River in the Anqing area, under the command of responsible party and government cadres, no levees were breached during flood prevention and rescue. Currently, the flood peaks of these rivers have subsided, and cadres at all levels are working with farmers to repair dikes and strengthen flood control efforts.

This powerful and concentrated rainstorm caused flood damage in some areas such as Langxi, Guangde, and Xuancheng. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Anhui Provincial People's Committee have sent working groups to the disaster areas to express their condolences to the victims and have allocated a batch of relief funds and rations to support the victims' production. The Wuhu Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also instructed relevant departments to allocate 7 million jin of grain and 190,000 yuan in loans to help the victims overcome difficulties in production and life. Currently, farmers in the affected areas are rushing to drain water and replant seedlings to restore production.

Zhengzhou, July 13th: From July 6th to 10th, Henan Province experienced two consecutive heavy rains, with the center of rainfall in the Funiu Mountain area. According to measurements in eleven counties including Fangcheng, Nanyang, and Lushan, the average daily rainfall was 100 to 200 millimeters. This is the first heavy rain encountered in Henan Province since entering the flood season.

The characteristic of this rainfall was its intensity, with a maximum rainfall of 87 millimeters per hour. Therefore, despite the day and night efforts of the broad masses of cadres and people in rescue and drainage, some areas still suffered from disaster. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen counties including Luohe, Xiangxian, and Yexian, more than 1.41 million mu of land were flooded, more than 590,000 mu of land were waterlogged, and more than 30,000 houses collapsed. According to preliminary statistics from Yexian and Minquan counties alone, more than 280 villages were surrounded by water. Currently, the broad masses of people and cadres in the above-mentioned seventeen counties are fighting the floods intensely.

The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a standing committee meeting on the 12th to review the province's flood control work. The meeting emphasized that this year's climate is unpredictable, and it is necessary to overcome complacency and fully prepare for flood control. The Henan Provincial People's Committee has sent letters of condolence to the disaster areas and the masses who actively participated in flood control, encouraging everyone to persevere in the fight against the floods.

    皖南人民战胜特大洪水  河南部分地区暴雨成灾
    据新华社合肥13日电　新华社记者石正章报道：安徽省皖南地区成千上万的干部和农民最近与特大洪水进行了一次非常艰苦的斗争。由于抢救及时，终于战胜了多年罕见的特大洪水。部分受灾地区现在正在进行善后工作。
    7月初，皖南青弋江、水陼江、秋浦河、青通河、郎川河和漳河等流域，由于暴雨集中，山洪暴发，河水普遍上涨，出现了1954年型的特大洪水。在洪水威胁着沿河人民的生命财产的时候，各级党、政负责人都率领大批干部，赶往险要地点领导防洪抢险工作。安庆专区在江南的各县，在党、政负责干部指挥防洪抢险下，没有溃破一个圩。目前这些河流的洪峰都已下降，各地干部又和农民一道整修堤防，加强防汛工作。
    这次强大而集中的暴雨，使郎溪、广德、宣城等部分地区遭受了洪水灾害。中共安徽省委员会和安徽省人民委员会已派出工作组，分赴受灾地区慰问灾民，并拨发了一批救济款和口粮，支持灾民生产。中共芜湖地方委员会也指令有关部门拨下七百万斤粮食和十九万元贷款，帮助灾民克服生产和生活上的困难。现在，受灾地区农民正在突击排水补苗，恢复生产。
    本报郑州13日电　7月6日至10日，河南省连续两次大雨，降雨中心在伏牛山区。据方城、南阳、鲁山等十一个县的测量，一天的降雨量平均为一百公厘至二百公厘。这是进入汛期以来，河南省首次遇到的大雨。
    这次降雨的特点是强度大，最多一小时降雨八十七公厘。因此，虽经广大干部和群众日夜抢险、排涝，仍有部分地区受到灾害。根据漯河、襄县、叶县等十七个县不完全统计，被洪水淹地一百四十一万多亩，内涝淹地五十九万多亩，塌房三万多间。被水包围的村庄，仅叶县和民权县初步统计，就有二百八十多个。现上述十七个县的广大群众和干部正在紧张地同洪水搏斗中。
    中共河南省委12日召开常委会议，检查了全省防汛工作。会议强调指出今年气候变化无常，必须克服麻痹思想，充分做好防汛准备工作。河南省人民委员会已对受灾地区和积极参加防汛群众发出慰问信，勉励大家坚持与洪水搏斗。
