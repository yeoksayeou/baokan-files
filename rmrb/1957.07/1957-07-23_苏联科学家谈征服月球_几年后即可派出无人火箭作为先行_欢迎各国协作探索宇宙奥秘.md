Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 22nd: Soviet Deputy Doctor of Technical Sciences, Khlebtsevich, recently spoke further to a reporter from the Soviet "Labor News" about his radio-controlled cosmic rocket plan. He said that the Soviet Union will conquer the moon with radio-controlled rockets and small tanks or laboratories in the next five to ten years. The feasibility of this flight has a solid scientific basis. In particular, the development of television science now makes it possible for us to send the first unmanned cosmic rockets without waiting for the final resolution of the problem of human life under new conditions. The take-off and landing of the rocket will be realized under the control of radio and television institutions. After the mobile laboratory shaped like a tracked mini-tank arrives on the moon, it will automatically photograph the phenomena on the surface of the moon and the sky and transmit them to the earth through television equipment. Millions of television viewers on Earth will be able to see it. He said that this plan is relatively simple and easy to implement, and saves fuel. This type of unmanned rocket does not require special protective equipment, and it may not even need to fly back. According to the designers' designs, manned rockets require millions of tons of structure and fuel. But to send a laboratory, only two hundred and fifty tons are needed. Sending unmanned rockets can also select landing sites for future manned rockets, and send fuel, equipment, water, air, and food in advance.

Khlebtsevich said that his plan was proposed several years ago. Not long ago, the American "Mechanics Illustrated" published an article by Haas. This author said uneasily that the United States would need at least thirty years to explore the moon. The Soviet plan is much earlier and costs less. Therefore, the United States must now declare its rights to the moon and must conquer the moon earlier than the Soviet Union. Khlebtsevich said that Soviet scholars do not understand the intention of this article. Soviet scientists do not want to build military bases on the moon to threaten the United States. Their efforts in this regard are to understand the secrets of the universe more quickly. Moreover, Soviet scientists are willing to cooperate with scientists from the United States and other countries to realize this plan.

    苏联科学家谈征服月球
    几年后即可派出无人火箭作为先行
    欢迎各国协作探索宇宙奥秘
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联技术科学副博士赫列勃采维奇，最近对苏联“劳动报”记者进一步谈到了他的放射宇宙火箭计划。他说，苏联将在今后五年到十年的时间内，用无线电指挥火箭和小型坦克或实验室来征服月球。这种飞行的现实性有巩固的科学根据。特别是现在电视科学的发展，使我们可能发出第一批无人的宇宙火箭，不必等待最后解决人类在新条件下生活的问题。火箭的起飞降落都将在无线电、电视机关的控制下实现。火箭上的像履带形小坦克车的活动实验室到达月球后，将自动把月亮表面和天空的现象拍摄下来，通过电视装备传往地球。成百万的地球上的电视观众可以看到它。他说，这个方案比较简单易行，而且节约燃料。这种不带人的火箭不要特别的保护设备，而且也可以不必飞回来。如果根据设计师们的设计，载人的火箭须要几百万吨结构和燃料。但为了送去一座实验室，只须二百五十吨就可以了。派遣无人火箭还可以为未来载人的火箭选择降落地点，事先送去燃料、装备、水、空气和食物。
    赫列勃采维奇说，他的计划几年以前就提出了。不久前，美国“机械学画刊”登载了哈斯的一篇文章。这位作者不安地说，美国将至少在三十年内才能到月球上去探险。而苏联的计划要早得多，而且费用也很少。因此，美国现在必须宣布它对月球的权利，并且必须比苏联早征服月球。赫列勃采维奇说，苏联学者不理解这篇文章的用意。苏联科学家根本不想在月球上建立军事基地来威胁美国，他们在这方面的努力是要更快地了解宇宙的秘密。而且苏联科学家愿意和美国以及其他国家的科学家合作来实现这个计划。
