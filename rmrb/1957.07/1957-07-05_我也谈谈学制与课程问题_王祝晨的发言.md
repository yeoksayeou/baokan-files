Having studied and discussed Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," and all other reports, I express my agreement and support.

Now, I would also like to talk about the education system and curriculum issues:

When discussing the education system and curriculum, do not forget that China is a large country with complex situations. More flexibility should be given to various regions, and it should not be too rigid. I largely agree with Liao Shicheng's "My Opinions on the Education System" published in Wenhui Daily on April 13th and 14th, 1957. I believe that reducing primary school to four years is feasible. Currently, the high primary, junior high, and senior high school curricula have considerable overlap. Removing high primary, as Liao Shicheng said, would be beneficial.

However, adequate preparation is necessary; otherwise, it will be as unworkable as the five-year primary school system. The main issue is that rural areas have single-teacher primary schools, with one school per village, one classroom, students of all grades in one class, and a teacher usually with a high primary school education level. This is practically a private school and not worthy of being called a school. How can a four-year primary school system be implemented? I suggest that, taking advantage of the current agricultural cooperation, village primary schools should be merged in suitable locations, or at least jointly operated. Teachers should have at least a junior teacher training school education. The enrollment age can be six, seven, or eight years old. The length of schooling for older students can be shortened, combined with the literacy campaign. Schools can be government-run, privately-run, or jointly run by the government and the people. The proportions should be adapted to local conditions. Only then can education be easily popularized.

Once the education system is established, it must be matched with the school's basic construction, curriculum, and teachers before the four-year primary school system can be implemented. Do not make changes haphazardly if they cannot be matched. After removing high primary schools, some of the existing high primary schools can be converted into college preparatory classes, some upgraded to junior high schools, and some transformed into employment training classes or vocational schools. All should be based on specific conditions and be realistic, not aiming too high or divorcing from reality.

Recently, the Ministry of Education sought opinions on adding foreign languages to junior high schools, which still views junior high school from the old perspective of only preparing for higher education. If we consider that most junior high school graduates will be employed in the future, and fewer will pursue higher education, why sacrifice the majority to cater to the minority? Moreover, adding two or three hours of foreign language per week in junior high school will only distract students, increase their burden, and have little effect. If it is for the convenience of learning scientific and mathematical symbols, learning some English alphabet, phonetic transcription, two or three hundred common words, and everyday phrases as an introduction to foreign languages is acceptable. As long as the pronunciation is correct, it does not need to be included in the formal curriculum and can be used as extracurricular practice. In the early years of the Republic of China, some universities and colleges were colonized, and courses, textbooks, and entrance examination questions were mostly in English. Shandong University and Shandong Higher Normal School were ordered to close, and many middle school graduates could not pass the entrance exams. This forced us to add English in high primary schools and invite teachers from the Nanjing River and Maritime Engineering School to Jinan to tutor middle school and normal school students in English and mathematics after school. At that time, the students were older and often did not have time to focus on Chinese and other subjects, concentrating all their efforts on learning English and mathematics. By the time of the May Fourth Movement, the level of Shandong middle school students finally caught up with the national level. To this day, I still regret my mistake in adding English to high primary schools, and I still feel pained by the neglect of Chinese in middle school normal schools. I advise the Ministry of Education not to repeat the same mistakes. It is best to let junior high school students concentrate on building a solid foundation in the Chinese language, which will be of immense benefit whether they pursue higher education or seek employment. If you don't learn the Chinese language well in middle school normal school, you will encounter difficulties everywhere. This is my lifelong experience in education work.

If the curriculum is not adapted to a well-defined education system, the system will still be an empty shell. Primary and secondary education have a dual task: on the one hand, they should prepare students for higher education (hereinafter referred to as higher education), and on the other hand, they should cultivate new citizens with socialist consciousness, a certain level of cultural and scientific knowledge, and a healthy physique for the country (hereinafter referred to as employment). The old curriculum only had one, which was for higher education. After liberation, the 1951 new education system established the status of education for the working people and worker-peasant cadres in the education system at all levels, guaranteeing the working people the opportunity to receive education, but the curriculum still had only one, which was still for higher education. All roads led to university, but none were suitable for employment, so school education was divorced from productive labor.

To remedy this problem, there was the so-called dual-track system, where the schools for higher education attended by the children of the ruling class and the upper class in capitalist countries were one track, and the employment schools attended by the working people were another. This kind of unequal education system is now outdated. The 1922 new education system was formulated at a joint conference of provincial education associations in Jinan, and I was involved in it. It stipulated that secondary education should use an elective system, and that supplementary schools or classes for secondary courses should be established in various places. This was implemented until 1933, and those who experienced that education personally still praise that method as very good. In the primary and secondary school curriculum, in the early years of the Republic of China, the slogan of practical education was put forward. Recently, learning from the Soviet Union, basic production knowledge was added to middle schools, and manual labor was added to primary schools. Recently, the Ministry of Education has also given instructions to add agricultural knowledge. These are all ways to correct deviations.

Today, there are specialized colleges parallel to universities, technical schools and normal schools parallel to senior high schools, and only junior normal schools, which are being reduced, parallel to junior high schools, and nothing parallel to high primary schools. Relying solely on the subjects students study in school, without various kinds of tutoring classes, how can we adapt to the myriad of complex situations? The biggest problem in China today lies here. As Liao Shicheng said, the elective course system should be restored in senior high school from the second grade onwards, and various tutoring classes for employment and higher education should be added to senior and junior high schools. Each school does not need to be exactly the same and can develop one or two special subjects according to certain conditions. For example, basic production knowledge courses can be more easily managed if they are concentrated in one or two schools rather than taught and equipped in the same way in every school. The same applies to senior high schools. Because the high primary schools that were only for higher education have been removed and junior high schools and various tutoring classes have been added. Similarly, because of the separate establishment and merger of senior high schools, it is easier to set up schools for various tutoring classes by dividing or selecting subjects. However, how to train teachers for various tutoring classes should also be planned early. Students who wish to enter tutoring classes should pay tuition fees, and the government can also add a considerable number of scholarships. We can also learn from the Qingdao Huaxin Yarn Factory and open a mechanical and electrical training class, absorbing high primary school graduates for part-work and part-study, recovering the cost of training apprentices from production, and the apprentices also receive a small wage. Recently, some people have advocated setting up preparatory courses in universities. I believe that as long as various tutoring classes are set up together, they can be used to replace university preparatory courses, and there is no need to set up preparatory courses in universities. Alternatively, we can consider changing senior high school to a four-year system, adopting a departmental elective system from the second and third grades onwards.

Primary schools all had manual labor before liberation. Sometimes, the teacher assigned tasks that exceeded the children's abilities, and families often did the work for the children. This habit of children being separated from labor as soon as they enter school in the old society must be vigorously changed. I suggest that primary school manual labor should not be equipped by the school or taught by the teacher. All of it should be entrusted to families and agricultural cooperatives. In cities, it should be entrusted to families and neighborhood committees, letting them first teach children to do their own things, not to be served by others, such as washing their faces, sweeping the floor, making their beds, washing their clothes, fetching water, cooking, and making their own toys. At the same time, they should share certain family labor, agricultural cooperative or street voluntary labor that they are capable of, regular cleaning and hygiene, eliminating the four pests, planting trees, sunflowers, castor beans, raising chickens, feeding pigs, pulling weeds, collecting manure, simple industrial and agricultural work, keeping household accounts, recording work points, writing diaries, writing letters, and writing notes, cultivating children's labor habits, knowledge, and skills. That and the school curriculum should be given equal importance. If either of them does not meet the standards, they cannot graduate. The People's Daily editorial on June 5, 1957, "Laboring While Studying," points out a bright path for school education.

If the education system is good and the curriculum is good, but the textbooks are not well matched, the results will be half the effort. I once tried to compile a literacy manual for the working people. The first lesson was "One Person." When teaching, I explained that there was a kind of ape that originally walked on all fours. Because it loved labor, it gradually turned the back two limbs into two legs, stood upright, and turned the front two limbs into two hands, each with a thumb that could stand alone. Two hands are like four hands. The thumb is unique to humans, so the standing "亻" with outstretched hands is used to represent the human form. This is called "Labor Created Man Himself." The character "个" resembles a bamboo leaf. This lesson instills the correct attitude towards labor in students' lives from the very beginning. Primary school textbooks can also be done in the same way. We hope that the Ministry of Education will compile literacy textbooks based on Wang Yunwu's Two Thousand Characters for Children and other references, combined with simplified Chinese characters and standard pronunciation, and teach primary and secondary school teachers to learn to use them flexibly, laying a good foundation for children's literacy (some of the characters with more than eighteen strokes in the Ministry of Education's promulgated list of commonly used characters are not commonly used, while the character "孕" for contraception is not included and should be revised).

The junior high school Chinese language course is divided into literature and Chinese language. Why is the teaching material so profound that it is like that of a Qing Dynasty scholar, and the existing primary and secondary school teachers do not have that level of university education? We hope that junior high school students will only need to be able to write fluent vernacular Chinese, write Chinese characters neatly and clearly, not make mistakes in writing, and be able to read simple books and newspapers. As for whether they know linguistics or literary history, that is secondary. Teaching chemistry before physics in middle school was a good Chinese experience. Changing to teaching physics before chemistry makes it difficult and unrewarding for teachers and students because students have not learned mathematics well. This kind of thing can be handled flexibly by various places, and the Ministry of Education does not need to manage it too much or too rigidly. Similarly, primary and secondary school textbooks should all have national unified textbooks, which are mainly compiled by the central government, and should all have local special textbooks, which are compiled by the local governments. On the one hand, cultivate a love for the country and hometown, and on the other hand, cultivate knowledge and skills to adapt to the environment. When the two are used together, the purpose of education can be fully achieved. We taught Shandong local textbooks in Shandong and taught relevant Jinan textbooks from The Travels of Lao Can in Jinan. Students felt it was intimate, interesting, and easy to learn. If the central government takes over all the primary and secondary school textbooks without leaving room for local special textbooks, it would not be as good as considering the actual situation of China with 600 million people.

In order to improve the quality and expand the quantity of schools at all levels, the practice of the Beiyang government of encouraging donations to build schools and the experience of the Chinese National Association for the Advancement of Education in promoting popular education are all worth adopting. Currently, some universities and colleges enroll senior high school graduates whose level cannot keep up with the class and still have to provide them with remedial lessons. Why not provide them with remedial lessons before they enter universities? For example, university teachers and students can help drive the nearby middle schools, and middle school teachers and students can help drive the nearby primary schools or the literacy campaign. Agencies, enterprises, factories, mines, and agricultural cooperatives can also run their own schools, tutoring classes, train apprentices, or contact nearby schools to help each other. For example, the newspapers, magazines, and books they have read, the teaching aids they have made, the sports venues, the practice gardens, the simple technology, the current affairs and policy learning reports, the assistance with teacher preparation, the assistance with student review, human resources, material resources, and financial resources can all provide various conveniences to the schools they help drive. The schools that are helped and driven should also reward the schools, agencies, enterprises, factories, mines, agricultural cooperatives, etc. that help and drive them appropriately (such as voluntary labor) in order to establish close ties. This is a trend that should be especially promoted.

Many of the above opinions are based on my personal experience. Are they correct? I request all representatives to give me criticism and correction!

### 我也谈谈学制与课程问题  王祝晨的发言

    我也谈谈学制与课程问题
    王祝晨的发言
    学习和讨论了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲话，和周总理“政府工作报告”及其他一切报告，我表示同意和拥护。
    现在，我也来谈谈学制与课程问题：
    谈到学制与课程，不要忘记中国是个大国，情形复杂，要多留给各地以弹性，不应过于死板。文汇报一九五七年四月十三、四日廖世承的“我对于学制的意见”，我大体同意。我认为小学改为四年是可以的。目前，高小、初中、高中教材三个大圆周，重复的不少，裁去高小，有如廖世承所说，是有好处的。
    可是要有相当的准备，否则将和五年一贯制小学一样行不通。主要的是乡村单设初级小学，是一村一个小学，一个教室，一班学生各年级都有，一个教师多是高小程度，这简直是私塾，够不上叫做学校，那能实行小学四年制呢？我建议趁今农业合作化，把各村小学合并于适中适当地点，至少联合起来。教师应提到初师毕业程度，入学年龄六岁、七岁、八岁都可，年龄大的在校年限可以缩短，和扫盲运动结合起来。也可官办，也可民办，也可官民合办，此中比例，因地制宜。这才容易普及教育。
    学制制订好，必须学校的基本建设、课程、教师，配合得上，才可改为四年制小学，配合不上的不可乱改。裁去高小，把现有的高小，有的改为升学补习班，有的提升为初中，有的改设为就业训练班、职业学校。全要按照一定条件，实事求是，不要好高鹜远，脱离实际。
    近来教育部征求在初中添设外国语的意见，仍是把初中作为只顾升学的旧眼光。如果顾及初中毕业生将来就业者多，升学的少，为什么牺牲多数来俯就少数呢？而且初中每周添两三点外国语，徒分学生精力，加重学生负担，效率不大。如为学习理化学术符号便利，学习点英语字母拼音常用字二三百字，及日常用语作为练习外国语开头，只要读音正确，不必列入正式课程，只作为业余练习，是可以的。民国初年，有些高等学校殖民地化，课程用书，招生试题，多用英文。山东高等学校和高等师范奉令停办，中学毕业生多考不上升学，逼得我们在高小添英文，从南京河海工程学校请派教员来济南为中学师范学生课外补习英文数学。那时在校学生年龄较大，多不暇顾及国文及其他科目，集中全力学习英文数学。到了五四运动时，山东中学生程度，才赶上全国水平。对在高小添英文，至今忏悔不了我的罪过，对中学师范忽视国文，至今我仍痛心疾首。我劝教育部不要重蹈复辙，最好让初中学生专心努力打好语文基础，无论升学或就业，都有说不尽的好处。在中学师范学不好语文，到处都要有苦处。这是我一生教育工作的经验。
    定好学制，如果课程不相适应，学制仍是一个空架子。中小学教育具有双重任务：一方面它应替学生做好升学的准备（以后简称升学），一方面要为国家培养具有社会主义觉悟一定文化科学知识水平和健康体质的新公民（以后简称就业）。而旧有课程只有一个，那就是为升学。解放后，一九五一年的新学制，确定劳动人民和工农干部教育在各级学校教育系统中的地位，保证劳动人民有受教育的机会，但课程仍只有一个，仍是为升学。条条道路通大学，条条道路不适于就业，于是学校教育和生产劳动脱节。
    为着补救这个毛病，有所谓双轨制，那就是资本主义国家为它统治阶级及上层社会子女所进的升学学校是一轨，劳动人民所进的就业学校是一轨。这一种不平等的学制于今已不行时了。一九二二年新学制是全国省教育会联合会在济南开会时制订的，我曾与闻其事。那里规定中等教育得用选科制，各地得设中等课程之补习学校或补习科，实行到一九三三年，亲身受过那时教育的，至今称赞那种办法很好。在中小学课程中，民国初年，提出实用教育的口号，近来学习苏联在中学添基本生产知识，在小学添手工劳动，最近教育部又有添加农业知识的指示。都不失为补偏救弊的一种办法。
    于今和大学平行的有专科，和高中平行的有技术学校和师范，和初中平行的就只有初级师范还要缩减，和高小平行的就什么都没有了。只凭学生在校学习的科目，没有各种各样的补习班，怎样适应复杂万状的情形呢？中国目前绝大毛病，就在这里。诚如廖世承所说，高中从二年级起恢复分科选科制，并把高、初中为就业的为升学的各种各样科目补习班添设起来。各校不必一模一样，都可根据一定条件发挥一两科特长。如基本生产知识科目，各校同样开课，同样设备，不如集中一两校来办较为容易，高中亦然。因为裁去了单为升学的高小而添办了初中和各种补习班。同样，因为高中的单设和合并，便于分科或选科而腾挪出添办各种补习班的学校。惟怎样训练各种各样补习班的教师，亦应提早规划。学生愿入补习班的都要缴纳学费，政府也可添设相当数量的助学金。还可仿照青岛华新纱厂开办机电训练班，吸收高小毕业生半工半读，从生产中收回培养学徒的教养费用，学徒的亦得到低微的工资。近来有人主张大学设预科。我以为只要各种各样补习班，一齐办起来，就可顶大学预科之用，不必再在大学设预科。再不然，可考虑高中改为四年制，从二三年级起，采用分科选科制。
    小学在解放前都有手工劳作，有时教师分配作业超过儿童能力，常有家庭替儿童代作。旧社会儿童一入学校，家庭就叫他脱离劳动，这个习惯必须力改。我建议小学手工劳动，不必由学校设备，不必由教师任教。全部委托家庭和农业合作社，在城市就委托家庭和居民委员会，让他先教儿童学会自己的事情自己干，不叫别人伺候他，例如洗脸扫地、整理床铺、缝洗衣服、取水、做饭、自制玩具。同时分担他力能胜任的一定家庭劳动、农业社或街道义务劳动、经常清洁卫生、除四害、种树、种向日葵、种蓖麻子、养鸡、喂猪、拔草、拾粪、简易工农活、记家庭日用帐、记工分、写日记、写信、写便条、养成儿童的劳动习惯知识技能，和校内课程并重，那一样不够标准，都不能毕业。人民日报一九五七年六月五日“一面劳动一面读书”社论，正为学校教育指出光明大道。
    学制好，课程好，教材配合不够好，也将事倍而功半。我曾试编过劳动人民识字手册，第一课是“一个人”。教学时说明有一种类人猿，原用四肢走路。因为它热爱劳动，渐渐把后两肢变成两条腿，直立步行，把前两肢变成两只手，每只手有一个大拇指，独当一面，两只手就好像四只手。大拇指是人类所特有的，所以用伸着手站着“亻”来象人形，这就叫“劳动创造了人类本身”。个字象竹叶形。这一课一入学就端正学生人生的劳动态度，初小课文也可照办。我们希望教育部根据王?友的文字蒙求二千余字及其他参考，结合汉字简化，普通语标准音编为识字课本，教给中小学教师学会灵活运用，为儿童识字打好基础（教育部颁布的常用字表十八画以上的字，有些不是常用字，而避孕的“孕”字反而没有列入，应该修正）。
      初中语文课分为文学、汉语，不知为什么教材高深得像前清秀才，现有中小学教师多没大学过的那样水平？我们希望初中学生，只要白话文做得文从字顺，汉字写得端正清楚，不写错白字，能够阅读浅显书报，予愿已足，至于语言学、文学史会不会倒在其次。中学先教化学后教物理本是中国优良经验。改为先教物理后教化学，学生数学没有学到，师生就费力而不讨好。这种事可由各地变通办理，教育部用不着管的太多太死。同样，中、小学教材都应有全国统一教材，由中央主编，都应有地方特殊教材，由地方自编，一方面培养爱国爱乡心理，一方面培养适应环境的知识技能。两者互相为用，教育目的才能完全达到。我们在山东教过山东乡土教材，在济南教过老残游记上的有关济南教材，学生感觉亲切有味而容易学会。中央把中、小学教材全部包揽，不给地方的特殊教材留有余地，如从六万万人口的中国实际情形考虑过，当不如是。
    为要提高各级学校的质量，扩大各级学校的数量，北洋政府的捐资兴学奖励，中国平民教育促进会促进平民教育的经验，都有可采之处。目前有些高等学校，招收的高中毕业生程度跟不上班，还得为他们补习功课。何如在高中学生未入高等学校之前，就为他们补习功课呢？如高等学校师生帮助带动附近中等学校，中等学校师生帮助带动附近小学或扫除文盲运动。机关、企业、工矿、农业社同样可自办学校、补习班、带徒弟或和附近学校联系互相帮助。如看过的报章杂志书籍，试制的教具产品、运动场所、实习园地、浅近技术、时事政策学习报告、帮助教师备课、帮助学生复习、人力物力财力等，都可给它所帮助带动的学校以种种便利，被帮助带动的学校也应恰如其分地酬报帮助带动它的学校、机关、企业、工矿、农业社等（如义务劳动）以便密切联系。这是一种风气，应该特别提倡的。
    上述这个意见，不少是我亲身经验过的，是否正确？请求各位代表给予我以批评和指正！
