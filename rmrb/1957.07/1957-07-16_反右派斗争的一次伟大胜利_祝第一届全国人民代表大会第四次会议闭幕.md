A Great Victory in the Anti-Rightist Struggle
    —Congratulating the Closing of the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress

    The Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress has victoriously completed its tasks. After full discussion, the congress passed resolutions on Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, on the 1956 state final accounts and the 1957 state budget, and on the 1957 national economic plan, resolutions on the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, resolutions on the work reports of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, resolutions on the election of deputies to the Second National People's Congress, resolutions on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, resolutions on the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, resolutions on the death penalty cases to be judged or approved by the Supreme People's Court, and resolutions on Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the Sino-Burmese border issue.
    This congress was held at a time when the struggle of the people of the whole country against the bourgeois right-wingers was entering its climax. As everyone knows, this struggle is actually a continuation of the socialist revolution of 1956 on the political and ideological fronts, and it is of great importance to the future of the entire country and the destiny of the people. Therefore, from the various reports of the congress to the group discussions and congress speeches, it was filled with the revolutionary spirit of opposing the bourgeois right-wingers. The representatives refuted the erroneous remarks spread by the right-wingers with their own personal experiences, proving that China must adhere to the socialist road, and that to take the socialist road, the leadership of the Communist Party must be upheld. Whether in the speeches at the congress or in the group discussions, the representatives (except for a very few right-wingers) expressed extreme indignation at the right-wingers and warm support for the Communist Party's line, policies, and the country's fundamental system. The representatives also exposed many reactionary activities of the right-wingers. Their righteous and stern questions forced the right-wingers among the representatives to bow their heads and confess their guilt. This is a great victory in the anti-rightist struggle.
    The course of this congress vividly proved that the great unity of the people of the whole country on the basis of socialism is very solid and unshakable. The bourgeois right-wingers completely underestimated this point when they were launching a frenzied attack on the people's socialist cause. Blinded by greed, they made completely wrong estimates of the political situation within the people. Their gamble has failed. This congress also proved that although the transformation of intellectuals and the transformation of industry and commerce are far from complete, great achievements have already been made. The majority of intellectuals and representatives of industry and commerce stood on the side of supporting socialism in this struggle, and through the tempering of this struggle, their understanding has become clearer.
    At this congress, the right-wingers among the representatives, after being exposed and criticized by all sides, made self-criticisms of their mistakes. Among them, some people's self-criticisms showed a determination to repent, although the sincerity of the self-criticisms varied; some people's self-criticisms, whether they were attempting to muddle through with deceptive tactics that avoided the important and dwelt on the trivial, or whether they also had some intention of confessing and repenting, needs to be proven by their future actions; and some people's "self-criticisms," at a glance, showed that they had not confessed with sincerity. However, as long as they are not incorrigible and do not cut themselves off from the people, as long as they truly begin to admit their mistakes, they are always welcome. Everything in the world changes, and the right-wingers are also changing. Because the people have waged a resolute struggle against the right-wingers, the right-wingers are now isolated, and if they are unwilling to cut themselves off from the people, then they now have no other way out except to thoroughly admit their mistakes and start anew. Premier Zhou said in the government work report, "We hope that, through the impetus of external forces, the experience of life, and their own awakening, the right-wingers can suddenly repent and accept transformation. The door to socialist transformation is open to them." As long as they turn back to good, then the principle of learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones and curing the disease to save the patient is still applicable to them, and they still have the possibility of turning from negative factors into positive factors.
    This National People's Congress was a great success, which will not only greatly promote the progress of our various tasks, but also greatly promote the anti-rightist struggle of the people of the whole country. However, it should be seen that completely crushing the activities of the right-wingers politically and ideologically is still a long-term task. We should continue to adopt the method of exposing the facts of the right-wingers' reactionary activities and reasoning, on the basis of the victories we have already achieved, so that the struggle can be deepened and our country's socialist revolution can achieve a complete victory on the political and ideological fronts.

### 反右派斗争的一次伟大胜利——祝第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议闭幕

    反右派斗争的一次伟大胜利
    ——祝第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议闭幕
    第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议已经胜利地完成了它的任务。大会经过了充分的讨论之后，通过了关于周恩来总理的政府工作报告，关于1956年国家决算和1957年国家预算和关于1957年度国民经济计划的决议，关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告的决议，关于最高人民法院工作报告和最高人民检察院工作报告的决议，关于第二届全国人民代表大会代表选举问题的决议，关于成立广西僮族自治区的决议，关于成立宁夏回族自治区的决议，关于死刑案件由最高人民法院判决或者核准的决议，关于周恩来总理兼外交部长关于中缅边界问题的报告的决议。
    这次大会开会期间，正是全国人民反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争进入高潮的时候。大家知道，这一斗争实际上是1956年的社会主义革命在政治战线和思想战线上的继续，它对于整个国家的前途和全国人民的命运关系十分重大。因此，从大会的各项报告到小组讨论和大会发言，一直充满了反对资产阶级右派的革命精神。代表们用自己亲身经历的事实驳斥了右派分子散布的错误言论，证明中国必须坚持走社会主义道路，而要走社会主义道路就必须坚持共产党的领导。不论在大会发言中和小组讨论中，代表们（除极少数右派分子以外）都表现了对右派分子的极端愤慨，表现了对共产党的路线、政策和对国家的根本制度的热烈拥护。代表们还揭露了许多右派分子的反动活动。他们的义正词严的责问，迫使代表中的右派分子不能不低头认罪。这是反右派斗争的一次伟大胜利。
    这次大会的进程，生动地证明了全国人民在社会主义基础上的大团结是十分巩固的，不可动摇的。资产阶级右派分子在向人民的社会主义事业猖狂进攻的时候完全没有估计到这一点。利令智昏，他们对于人民内部的政治形势作了完全错误的估计。他们的赌博落空了。这次大会还证明了知识分子的改造和工商界的改造虽然远没有完成，但是已经取得很大的成绩。大多数知识分子和工商界的代表在这一斗争中是站在拥护社会主义方面的，而且经过这一次斗争的锻炼，他们的认识更明确了。
    在这次大会上，代表中的右派分子们经过各方面的揭发和批判，对自己的错误作了检讨。其中，有些人的检讨表示有悔改的决心，虽然检讨的诚恳程度各有不同；有些人的检讨，究竟是企图用避重就轻的欺骗手法蒙混过关，还是也有若干交代悔改之意，需要他们今后用自己的行动来证明；也有些人的“检讨”，一望而知是还没有交代悔改的诚意的。但是，只要他们不是怙恶不悛、自绝于人民，只要他们真正开始承认自己的错误，总是值得欢迎的。世界上的一切事物都会发生变化，右派分子们也在变化。由于人民向右派分子进行了坚决的斗争，右派分子现在孤立起来了，只要他们不愿自绝于人民，那末，他们现在除了彻底认错、重新作人以外，已再没有别的出路。周总理在政府工作报告中说，“我们希望，经过外力的推动、生活的体验和自己的觉悟，右派分子能够幡然悔悟，接受改造。社会主义改造的大门对他们是开着的。”只要他们回心向善，那么，惩前毖后、治病救人的原则对于他们还是适用的，他们还是有可能由消极因素变为积极因素。
    这次全国人民代表大会开得很好，不仅会大大推进我们的各项工作的前进，而且大大推动了全国人民的反右派斗争。但是应该看到，在政治上、思想上完全粉碎右派的活动，还是一个长时间的任务。我们应该在已经取得的胜利的基础上，继续采取揭露右派的反动活动事实和说理的方法，使斗争深入下去，使我国的社会主义革命在政治战线和思想战线上得到彻底的胜利。
