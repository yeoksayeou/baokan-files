Ma Zhemin, the chairman of the China Democratic League's Hubei Provincial Committee and president of the Central South University of Finance and Economics, who has consistently portrayed himself as a Marxist-Leninist, has been exposed for what he truly is in the current wave of mass struggle against the rightists. It turns out that he is a political careerist cloaked in Marxist-Leninist garb, standing on the bourgeois side, and opposing socialism.

He dispatched people to light fires everywhere, demanding that League members "expose the dark secrets of the Party" and that "an elephant's trunk could be described as a bamboo tube."

In the early stages of the rectification campaign, Ma Zhemin told a reporter from the Guangming Daily that in order to truly "speak out," the leadership must first boldly "let go," allowing everyone to "pour out their grievances" and "vent their complaints" to relieve ideological pressure and constraints. He also said that people had been made to suffer too much and become too heartbroken during the ideological remolding movement, especially during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. To this end, he first dispatched rightist elements from the provincial committee of the China Democratic League to major universities and colleges in the Wuhan area to stir up trouble. At a Wuhan City League members' meeting, Ma Zhemin even said, "This time, in helping the Party to rectify, anything can be said. For example, an elephant's trunk can be described as a bamboo tube." Ma Zhemin's confidant, Lu Mingqiu, even impersonated the United Front Work Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CCP to secretly stir up trouble at the Central China Institute of Technology.

When Ma Zhemin sent people to the Central China Normal College to collect materials on "suppressing counter-revolutionaries" and "wage reform," some cadres of the League branch at the Central China Normal College did not approve of collecting materials behind the backs of the college's Party committee. Therefore, they disregarded these League members who leaned towards the Party and took action themselves. They again sent Lu Mingqiu to this branch, calling on all League members to "not talk about viewpoints or positions, but to expose the dark secrets of the Party." In late May, rightist elements from the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League held a "black meeting" at Zhongshan Park in Hankou, attended by teachers from the Wuhan Normal College. After the meeting, they sent Zhang Yunmian and Li Qiushan to various schools to promote the experience of organizing this "black meeting."

Ma Zhemin also instructed members of the Provincial Committee of the Democratic League to collect opinions from workers and peasants about the Party in various counties, and asked everyone to pay attention to the activities of young students. He said, "Only when these people are mobilized can the 'speaking out' be successful... Workers and students rising up will have great power."

He incited students to petition in Beijing. He said, "First affirming achievements is the main thing, is simply bullshit."

As president of the Central South University of Finance and Economics, Ma Zhemin seized upon the weakness of young students' inexperience and openly incited them, attempting to use them as tools against socialism. He presented himself as a representative of student interests, attending large and small student meetings and meeting with student representatives every day. After a few students raised the issues of "unclear professional training goals, low social status for graduates, and low wages," Ma Zhemin took the opportunity to deliver an inflammatory speech, arguing that these opinions were "completely correct" and "not exaggerating the facts at all," and that he "fully supported" them. He said, "There are too many problems at the Central South University of Finance and Economics, which is at a critical juncture. Everyone's opinions have saved the University of Finance and Economics." He added, "In the past, our summaries of teaching work always started by affirming achievements as the main thing, but now it seems like it was simply bullshit." Then he incited the students, saying, "For the problems you have, the school will do its best to solve those it can; for those it cannot solve, it will ask for instructions from the Ministry of Higher Education; if the Ministry of Higher Education cannot solve them, then in order not to delay your youth, I will agree to your request to leave the University of Finance and Economics and transfer to another university; as long as your problems are solved, I don't care if I am no longer the president."

Some students felt discouraged after hearing Ma Zhemin's words and only wanted to transfer to another university. At this point, Ma Zhemin repeatedly told the students that he "deeply sympathized" with the "suffering" of young people and said, "I am preparing to forward the students' opinions to the Ministry of Higher Education and ask them to send someone to solve the problems. If they don't send anyone, we will send a delegation to Beijing." Under Ma Zhemin's incitement, the students immediately organized a delegation to go to Beijing. Before their departure, Ma Zhemin added fuel to the fire, saying, "You go and make a fuss, it's no problem. The bureaucracy of the Ministry of Higher Education is very serious, you should put them on the spot."

Ma Zhemin also viciously slandered the Party's cadre policy, further inciting students' dissatisfaction with the Party. He told students in the Department of Agricultural Economics, "Your training goals are clear. The goals are managerial cadres such as section chiefs and farm managers. However, these positions are all occupied by old cadres. These people don't have high professional skills, but they must be leaders. They can't do any work other than leading." He also said that the current contradictions between the Party and workers, peasants, and young students surpassed the contradictions between the Party and senior intellectuals. He attempted to incite workers, peasants, and young students to oppose the Party, shake the Party's foundations, and thereby destroy the Party.

He instructed professors who had previously leaned toward the Party to "help the Party rectify" with the attitude of "approving what the Party approves, and disapproving what the Party disapproves."

Ma Zhemin incited the teachers of the Central South University of Finance and Economics to oppose the Party. He actively encouraged those who had been investigated in the "Three-Anti," "Ideological Remolding," and "Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries" movements to "pour out their grievances as much as possible." He told professors who had previously leaned toward the Party, "You people have helped the Party build the wall in the past, always approving what the Party approves and disapproving what the Party disapproves. Therefore, in this help to the Party's rectification, you must 'go against the previous path'." That is, take the attitude of "approving what the Party disapproves, and disapproving what the Party approves." Professor Li Guangwei refuted him, saying, "What the Party disapproves of is the enemy of the people, do you want me to approve of them?"

Professor Wang Xianglin (chairman of the League branch) said, "Once, President Ma told me that Party cadres have a fascist style; the 'Further Discussion on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat' is dogmatic. He wanted to abolish the Party committee system in the school, but he didn't say it himself, but wanted me to bring it up. I said that it would probably be wrong for the school to not have the leadership of the Party committee. He immediately put on a stern face and said, 'Your thinking is not clear; if the Party committee system is not abolished, it will be impossible to convince the stubborn elements within the Party.'"

He spread rumors about abolishing the school's Party committee system, demanding that League members offer more opinions to "persuade" Party members to leave the school.

Ma Zhemin fabricated facts to slander the Party, exaggerating some shortcomings in the work into the whole; expanding the mistakes of individual Party members into the mistakes of the entire Party, attempting to achieve the goal of weakening the Party's leadership. Professor Shao Zifeng of Central China Normal College said, "Once, at the Standing Committee meeting of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the League, Ma Zhemin openly said that the old cadres are 'adhering to the three major isms (referring to sectarianism, subjectivism, and bureaucratism), and are well-versed in the Four Books of Confucius (grabbing pigtails, labeling, putting on airs, and wanting face)'; saying that 'old Party members are all empiricists, and new Party members are dogmatists, unable to cope with the complex situation after liberation'." Last year, Ma Zhemin, in his capacity as a national people's representative, returned from an inspection in Sichuan and told Professor Wang Xianglin and others at the Central South University of Finance and Economics: "A professor at a certain university in Sichuan told me: Communist Party members are some wooden men, with simple thoughts. This professor is unwilling to join the Party and unwilling to associate with these wooden men."

At a "Symposium on the Party Committee System in Universities and Colleges" convened by the Provincial Committee of the Democratic League, Ma Zhemin sent Lu Mingqiu to announce on his behalf: "The Central Government has decided to change the Party committee system in universities and colleges. Only a few Party members are unwilling to withdraw. Therefore, it is hoped that those present will offer more opinions on the Party committee system and expose the shortcomings as much as possible in order to persuade those Party members." After discussion, with the exception of two or three people who conditionally agreed to abolish the Party committee system, the majority of those present opposed abolishing the Party committee system. However, Ma Zhemin still said: "The Party committee system is increasingly hindering the development of universities and colleges." In his summary, he deliberately distorted the opinions of the participants, saying that everyone believed that "the Party committee system cannot exist."

As early as last summer, he began promoting Zhang Bojun's "two-house system" proposal.

Ma Zhemin's anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracy activities are guided by a clear bourgeois political program. On June 12, Ma Zhemin said to the faculty and staff of the Central South University of Finance and Economics: "In the future, the differences among the people will be the difference between progressing quickly and slowly towards the same goal, and there will be no major difference. Therefore, we cannot keep the concept of class fixed in our minds." He vehemently attacked the organizational form of the people's democratic government—democratic centralism; actively supported the "political design institute" proposed by Zhang Bojun, wanting to engage in bourgeois democracy and a "two-house system." He said, "The CPPCC was a power organ in its early stages, but it changed after the National People's Congress. Some people have proposed that the CPPCC should have the right to supervise the government and should become the nature of the upper house. I advocate this." (Ma Zhemin's report at Songmen Villa in Lushan in August 1956). He also said: "The CPPCC may be changed to a form equivalent to the upper house of capitalist countries; the People's Representative Conference may be changed to a form equivalent to the lower house. In this way, the relationship between the Party and the democratic parties for long-term coexistence will be fixed. The democratic parties must be confident, and we will also live ten thousand years." (Report at a symposium of grassroots cadres of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League on July 14, 1956).

Therefore, starting in the second half of last year, Ma Zhemin instructed the China Democratic League branches in major universities and colleges in the Wuhan area to actively expand their organizations. He said, "The China Democratic League is the only ferryboat for intellectuals to transition to socialism." Ma Zhemin also sent full-time cadre Chen Zhongzheng to the Central China Agricultural College to instruct: "The organizational activities of the League do not have to be discussed with the Party." In order to realize his political ambitions and compete with the Party on an equal footing, Ma Zhemin strongly advocated that the China Democratic League establish a newspaper in Wuhan to expand the League's influence.

He slandered the People's Daily's editorial against the rightists as dogmatism, and publicly defended Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, and others.

When the People's Daily published a series of editorials, fiercely counterattacking the rampant anti-communist and anti-socialist attacks of the rightists, Ma Zhemin relied on the false mask of progress he had always worn and his double-dealing tactics to resist stubbornly. He slandered the People's Daily editorial as a remnant of dogmatism; saying that the People's Daily's pointing out that the rightists were engaging in class struggle was wrong. At the same time, he publicly defended the reactionary remarks of Zhang Bojun, Chu Anping, Chen Xingui, and others, saying: "Their views are wrong, but whether it is a matter of position, I dare not draw a conclusion." He also said: "These people, at best, just want to engage in a little bourgeois democracy." He believed that Zhang Naiqi was somewhat backward, but those who opposed Zhang Naiqi were not necessarily progressive.

He was originally a revolutionary traitor, first betraying the Party, then betraying the League, and still complaining that Chiang Kai-shek was not promising.

Ma Zhemin's anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracy was not accidental. Ma Zhemin was born into a bureaucratic landlord family. After messing around in Japan for two years, he returned and joined the Chinese Communist Party. Not long after joining the Party, he was sent to the Soviet Union to study. In 1926, after the victory of the Northern Expeditionary Army reached Wuhan, Ma Zhemin returned to China. After the failure of the Great Revolution, Ma Zhemin was greedy for life and afraid of death. He disobeyed the work assigned by the Party and secretly took his family to Shanghai, joined the Chinese Kuomintang "Reorganization Faction" organized by Wang Jingwei and others, and declared that he "would overthrow the Communist Party with his left hand and Chiang Kai-shek with his right hand." During the Anti-Japanese War, Ma Zhemin was in Chengdu. When the democratic movement in the Chiang-controlled area was high, he ran to Chongqing with a progressive appearance and joined the Democratic League. However, because he was greedy for life and afraid of death, after being arrested in Chongqing, he immediately wagged his tail at Zhang Dulun (the puppet mayor of Chongqing) and wrote a letter declaring his withdrawal from the Democratic League. For this reason, the Central Committee of the Democratic League wanted to expel him from the League. Because Zhang Bojun helped with all his might, it was barely put aside. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhang Dulun served as the puppet chairman of Hubei Province, and Ma Zhemin hurriedly followed him to Hubei and, through Zhang's relationship, became a professor at the Hubei Agricultural College. After liberation, Ma Zhemin often recalled the favors of the reactionaries to him, and could not help but feel resentful, saying to everyone he met: "Chiang Kai-shek did not do well, and was not promising." From here, we can understand why Ma Zhemin wanted to oppose communism and socialism.

    章罗联盟驻武汉专员——马哲民
    凡坤
    一贯以马克思列宁主义者自居的民盟湖北省主委、中南财经学院院长马哲民，这些天来，在广大群众反右派斗争的浪潮下，原形毕露。原来他是一个披着马列主义外衣、站在资产阶级立场、反对社会主义的政治野心家。
    他派人四出点火，要盟员“揭开党的黑幕”，“把象鼻子说成竹筒都可以。”
    整风运动初期，马哲民对光明日报记者说：要想真正鸣起来，首先要领导方面大胆地“放”，要让大家“吐苦水”、“发牢骚”，这样才能解除思想上的压抑和束缚。他还说：在思想改造运动中、特别是在肃反运动中，把人们搞得太苦了、太伤心了。为此，他首先派遣民盟省委机关的右派分子，到武汉地区各大、专学校去点火。在一次武汉市盟员大会上，马哲民甚至说：“这次帮助党整风，什么都可以说，比如把象鼻子说成竹筒都可以。”马哲民的亲信陆鸣秋，并冒用中共湖北省委统战部的名义，秘密地到华中工学院去点火。
    当马哲民派人到华中师范学院去搜集“肃反”和“工资改革”资料时，华师盟支部的一些干部不赞成背着学院党委来搜集材料。于是，他们便撇开这些靠拢党的盟员，自己动起手来。并再次派陆鸣秋到这个支部，号召全体盟员：“不要讲什么观点立场，要揭开党的黑幕。”5月下旬，民盟湖北省委的右派分子，并在汉口中山公园召开了一个由武汉师专教师参加的“黑会”，会后并派张云冕、李秋山到各校去推动组织这次“黑会”的经验。
    马哲民还叫省民盟委员到各县去搜集工人、农民对党的意见；并要大家注意青年学生的活动。他说：“只有这些人动起来，才能‘鸣放’得起来……工人、学生起来，力量就大得很。”
    他煽动学生到北京请愿。他说：“首先肯定成绩是主要的，简直是放狗屁。”
    身为中南财经学院院长的马哲民，抓住了青年学生年纪轻、缺乏经验的弱点，明目张胆地煽动他们，企图利用他们作反社会主义的工具。他俨然以学生利益的代表者，出席同学们的大、小会议，天天接见学生代表。当少数同学提出“专业培养目标不明确、毕业生社会地位低、工资待遇低”的意见之后，马哲民便趁机发表了一篇煽动性的演说，认为，这些意见是“完全正确的”、“一点也没有夸大事实”，他“完全支持”。他说：“中南财经学院问题太多，正处在紧急关头，大家提出这些意见是挽救了财院。”他还说：“过去我们的教学工作总结中，首先肯定成绩是主要的，现在看起来简直是放狗屁。”接着他煽动同学说：“你们的问题，学校能够解决的尽力解决；不能解决的，请示高教部；如果高教部解决不了，那应为了不贻误你们的青春，你们要求离开财院、转院我也同意；只要你们的问题解决了，我这个院长不当也可以。”
    有些同学听了马哲民这一席话之后，很泄气。只想闹转院。这时，马哲民又一再向同学们表示，他“十分同情”青年人的“苦楚”，并说：“准备把同学们的意见转给高教部，请他们派人来解决。如果他们不来人，我们就派代表团上北京。”在马哲民的煽动下，同学们立即组织了一个代表团赴北京，出发前，马哲民又火上加油地说：“你们去闹，没问题。高教部的官僚主义很严重，要将他一军。”
    马哲民并恶毒地污蔑党的干部政策，进一步煽动学生对党不满。他对农业经济系的同学说：“你们的培养目标是明确的。目标是科长、场长等管理干部。但是，这些位子都被老干部占了。这些人业务不高，但都一定得当领导，除了领导之外，其他工作他们不能做。”他还说，目前党和工人、农民及青年学生之间的矛盾，超越了党与高级知识分子的矛盾。他企图煽动工人、农民及青年学生与党闹对立，动摇党的基础，从而把党搞垮。
    他教唆以往靠拢党的教授，要以“党所好恶之，党所恶好之”的态度“帮助党整风”。
    马哲民煽动中南财经学院的教师们与党闹对立。他积极鼓动过去在“三反”、“思想改造”和“肃反”运动中被审查过的人“尽量吐苦水”。他对过去靠拢党的教授说：“你们这些人，平时是帮助党筑了墙的，总是党之所好好之，党之所恶恶之，因此，在这次帮助党整风中，要“逆以往之道而行”。也就是采取“党所好恶之，党所恶好之”的态度。李光维教授曾反驳他说：“党所恶的是人民的敌人，难道也要我去好吗？”
    王祥麟教授（民盟支部主委）说：“有一次马院长对我说，党员干部是法西斯作风；‘再论无产阶级专政的历史经验’是教条。他想取消学校中的党委制，自己却不说，而要我去提。我说，学校不要党委领导恐怕不对头。他立即板起面孔说：是你的思想没搞通；党委制不取消，就无法说服党内的顽固派。”
    他散布取消学校党委制的谣言，要求盟员多提意见，“说服”党员退出学校。
    马哲民捏造事实污蔑党，把工作中的部分缺点扩大为全部；把个别党员的错误，扩大为全党的错误，企图以此达到削弱党的领导的目的。华中师范学院邵子风教授说：“有一次，在盟武汉市委常委会上，马哲民公开说：老干部是“坚持三大主义（指宗派主义、主观主义、官僚主义）、熟读四子书（抓辫子、扣帽子、摆架子、要面子）”；说“老党员都是经验主义，新党员是教条主义，应付不了解放后的复杂局面。”去年，马哲民以全国人民代表的身份，从四川视察回来，向中南财经学院教授王祥麟等说：“四川某大学有一个教授对我说：共产党员是一些木头人，思想简单。这位教授不愿入党，不愿与这些木头人为伍。”
    在一次民盟省委召开的“高校党委制座谈会”上，马哲民派陆鸣秋代他宣布说：“中央已决定改变高校党委制，只有少数党员不肯退出，因此希望到会者对党委制多提些意见，尽量揭露缺点，以便说服那些党员。”经过讨论，除了有两三个人附有条件的赞成取消党委制外，大多数到会者都反对取消党委制。然而，马哲民仍然说：“党委制越来越阻碍了高等学校的发展。”在总结时，他故意歪曲与会者的意见，说大家认为“党委制不能存在”。
    早在去年夏天，他就开始推销章伯钧“两院制”的主张。
    马哲民反共、反社会主义的阴谋活动，是有明确的资产阶级政治纲领作指导的。6月12日，马哲民对中南财经学院的教职员作报告时说：“今后人民内部的差别，是同一前进目标下的进步快、慢之分，没有多大差别了。因此，我们不能把阶级观念老放在脑子里不变。”他极力攻击人民民主政权的组织形式——民主集中制；积极支持章伯钧提出的“政治设计院”，要搞资产阶级民主、搞“两院制”。他说：“政协初期是一个权力机关，但在全国人民代表大会后就改变了。有人提出：政协应该对政府有监督权、应成为上议院的性质。我主张这样提。”（马哲民1956年8月在庐山松门别墅的报告）。他还说：“政协可能改为相当于资本主义国家上议院形式；人民代表会可能改成相当于下议院的形式。如此，就把党与民主党派长期共存的关系固定下来了。民主党派要自信起来，我们也要万岁了。”（1956年7月14日在民盟武汉市委基层干部座谈会上报告）
    于是，从去年下半年开始，马哲民便指示武汉地区各大专学校中的民盟支部积极扩大组织。他说：“民盟是知识分子过渡到社会主义的唯一的一只渡船。”马哲民并派专职干部陈中正，到华中农学院去指示：“盟组织活动，可不必和党商量。”为了实现他的政治野心，与党分庭抗礼，马哲民极力主张民盟在武汉市创办报纸，以扩大盟的影响。
    他污蔑人民日报反击右派的社论是教条主义，公开为章伯钧、储安平等辩护。
    当人民日报发表了一系列社论，对右派分子的反共、反社会主义的猖狂进攻猛烈回击的时候，马哲民仗着平时伪装进步的假面具和两面派手法进行顽抗。他污蔑人民日报社论是教条主义残余；说人民日报指出右派分子进行阶级斗争不对。同时，公开为章伯钧、储安平、陈新桂等人的反动言论辩护说：“他们的观点是错误的，是不是立场问题，还不敢做结论。”他还说：“这些人充其量不过是想搞点资产阶级民主。”他认为章乃器是落后一些，但反对章乃器的人也不一定进步。
    他原来是一个革命叛徒，先叛党，又叛盟，至今还埋怨蒋介石不争气。
    马哲民反共、反社会主义的阴谋，并不是偶然产生的。马哲民出身于官僚地主家庭，在日本鬼混过两年回来后，参加了中国共产党。入党不久，便被党派到苏联去学习。1926年，北伐军胜利到达武汉后，马哲民回国。大革命失败后，马哲民贪生怕死，不服从党所分配的工作，偷偷摸摸地带着眷属跑到上海，加入了汪精卫等组织的中国国民党“改组派”，宣布“要左手打倒共产党、右手打倒蒋介石”。抗日战争时期，马哲民在成都。当蒋管区民主运动高涨时期，他以进步面貌跑到重庆，参加了民主同盟。但是，由于他贪生怕死，他在重庆被捕后，马上摇尾乞怜于张笃伦（伪重庆市长），并写信声明脱离民盟。为此，民盟中央要开除他的盟籍。因为章伯钧竭力帮忙，才马马虎虎搁下来。抗日战争胜利后，张笃伦任伪湖北省主席，马哲民又连忙跟他赶到湖北，通过张的关系，到湖北农学院当教授。马哲民在解放后每每回忆起反动派对他的恩惠时，不由得牢骚满腹，逢人便说：“蒋介石不好好地搞，不争气。”从这里即可了解到：马哲民为什么要反共、反社会主义了。
