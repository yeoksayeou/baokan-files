Editorial: Four Suggestions on Developing Agriculture

In the process of national economic development, there is currently a prominent contradiction: although China's agriculture has greatly developed since liberation, it still lags far behind the needs of the people's livelihood and the requirements of light industry development. Actively and correctly resolving this contradiction is key to further boosting China's national economy.

Chairman Mao taught us: "China is a large agricultural country. The rural population accounts for more than 80% of the national population. The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture. Only then can industry have raw materials and markets, and be able to accumulate more funds for the establishment of a strong heavy industry." It should be pointed out that state planning agencies and certain local authorities generally paid more attention to industry and less attention to agriculture in the past. After the promulgation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), attention to agricultural development has increased, but some places still do not pay as much attention as to industrial development. In the future, the development of industry and the development of agriculture must go hand in hand, with equal attention.

In the second half of 1957, in addition to strengthening flood prevention, drainage, weeding, topdressing, pest control, seedling protection, autumn harvest, and autumn plowing to strive for a bumper harvest, we must also look ahead and behind, summarize experience, and make proper arrangements for agricultural development in the next few years, especially in 1958, as early as possible. Any work that can be started early should be started early.

Now, based on the experience of implementing China's First Five-Year Plan and the upcoming start of the Second Five-Year Plan, we would like to offer four suggestions to the relevant departments of state organs and local authorities.

First, build water conservancy projects, focusing on medium and small-sized ones. During the First Five-Year Plan period, about 60% of China's water conservancy investment was used in large-scale water conservancy projects. There is no doubt that large-scale projects such as the comprehensive harnessing of the Huai River and the comprehensive harnessing of the Yellow River are necessary. However, considering China's financial and economic situation, the need for less investment and quick results, and the specific situation of severe waterlogging disasters in our country, water conservancy construction, like industrial construction, should also implement a combination of large, medium, and small-sized projects in the future, with a focus on medium and small-sized projects (especially drainage). The construction of river harnessing and large reservoirs should be comprehensively planned, repeatedly studied, carefully decided, and carried out in stages. For medium-sized projects, especially small-sized projects that have been designed and will have significant benefits in the current or next year, they should be carried out first. In terms of project types, flood prevention and irrigation should be valued, but soil and water conservation and drainage should be placed in the most important positions. The population in China's mountainous areas accounts for about one-third of the national population, and the arable land area in mountainous areas (including hilly areas) accounts for nearly one-half of the national arable land area. Doing a good job in soil and water conservation is not only beneficial to agricultural production in mountainous areas, but also can reduce flood damage in plain areas. The effect of soil and water conservation work seems to be slow, but according to the typical experience of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi and other provinces, all places where the work is done well can increase production in the current year, so it must be carried out actively. According to the records of the past eight years, the arable land area affected by water disasters (mainly waterlogging) in China is about 40 to 50 million mu in bumper harvest years, about 60 to 70 million mu in normal years, and more than 150 million mu in lean years. Among the affected areas, waterlogging disasters account for about 40 to 50 million mu each year, and more than 120 million mu in 1956. These disaster-stricken areas have mainly been in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui provinces, which have large populations and fertile land. Drainage projects cost less and yield faster results than reclamation projects. Therefore, drainage projects should not only be placed on the main agenda of water conservancy construction, but also should be placed in the primary position of agricultural construction. We suggest that local authorities and water conservancy departments, in addition to actively preventing floods, should devote part of their efforts to seriously planning medium and small-sized water conservancy construction projects for next year, and after obtaining the consent of the state planning department, strive to start preparing for construction work after autumn this year.

Second, increase fertilizer production. Using various methods to increase fertilizer accumulation is an effective way to increase fertilizer sources in China at present. Currently, we should step up the work of planting green manure and weeding and matting circles to increase farmyard manure, as discussed in this newspaper's editorial on July 19. In the long run, increasing the production of chemical fertilizers and increasing the supply of fuel to rural areas, combined with water conservancy construction, have a decisive significance for agricultural production. During the First Five-Year Plan period, China built a total of thirteen larger chemical fertilizer plants. After all of them are completed, they can produce 1.06 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer, 640,000 tons of superphosphate, and 360,000 tons of phosphate rock powder annually. In the next two or three years, in addition to quickly completing these enterprises that have already started construction and putting them into production, a large number of medium and small-sized chemical fertilizer factories should also be built. The construction of these factories should basically rely on self-design and self-manufacturing equipment to achieve the goal of less investment and quick results. We suggest that the relevant departments of state organs, in conjunction with local authorities, conduct a comprehensive plan for the factory type, regional distribution, equipment manufacturing, raw material supply, product variety, construction sequence, etc. of chemical fertilizer factories, and implement them gradually, striving for a rapid increase in China's chemical fertilizer production in five to seven years. Closely related to increasing fertilizer production is increasing the mining of local small coal mines. Increasing the amount of coal supplied to rural areas can save a large amount of plant fuel and feed, thereby increasing fertilizer and increasing the planting area of ​​high-yield crops. Currently, about one-third of the total coal produced in China is supplied to rural areas. The quantity is not small, but it is far from meeting the needs of rural areas. With the development of China's industry and transportation, the demand for coal is increasing by more than 10 million tons every year. Therefore, in the future, the construction and production increase of modern coal mining industry should mainly meet the growing needs of industry and transportation, and it is impossible to increase the supply to rural areas in large quantities as in the past. So, how to increase the supply of coal needed by rural areas? Because China is rich in coal resources, and the people have many years of mining experience, decentralized mining of small mines saves transportation and is convenient for supply. Therefore, in the future, rural coal use should be based on local self-sufficiency and supplemented by central allocation. In 1957, the state opened up the mining of small coal kilns and encouraged local coal production policies, and local coal production will increase by more than 5.8 million tons compared with 1956, which shows that the potential is great. Therefore, we suggest that local authorities, according to the coal resource situation, the traditional mining experience of the people, and transportation conditions in their provinces and counties, mobilize and organize the masses to mine in a planned way to increase production and increase the supply to rural areas. The investment and management methods of local coal mines can be diverse. Agricultural production cooperatives can be used as a sideline business, and county and provincial investment management can also be adopted.

Third, take into account both increasing grain production and increasing cotton production. Before China can greatly expand its arable land area, in order to increase grain production and appropriately ensure the needs of people's consumption growth, it is necessary and correct to generally no longer expand the planting area of ​​industrial raw material crops. However, clothing must also be appropriately guaranteed. According to preliminary statistics, the national cotton planting area in 1957 was about 87 million mu, a decrease of 6.8 million mu compared with 93.8 million mu in 1956, which has a relatively significant impact on the increase in cotton production and the increase in yarn and cloth production in the next year. Therefore, whether it is appropriate to continue to reduce the cotton planting area is worth studying. In order to appropriately meet the growing clothing needs of the Chinese people, we should vigorously develop the synthetic fiber industry and open up resources for fibers other than cotton in the future. We suggest that the chemical industry department immediately start planning the long-term development plan of China's synthetic fiber industry, and start pilot construction in the next two years. The textile industry and the paper industry should conduct a comprehensive economic and technical study on saving wood, rationally utilizing cotton linters, sugarcane bagasse, cotton stalks and other fiber raw materials, and gradually reduce the amount of wood, cotton linters, and hemp skins used in the paper industry, and use these good materials to increase the production of textile industrial products. However, the greater effect of these measures will be at least three to five years later, so cotton is still the main raw material for the textile industry in the next three to five years. We believe that the cotton planting area in China should be stabilized at the level of last year and this year in the next few years. The expansion of the planting area of ​​food crops relies more on soil and water conservation, drainage, and reclamation of wasteland. This is especially recommended for consideration by Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong and other provinces with particularly high cotton planting.

Fourth, expand the arable land area. First of all, the relevant departments of state organs and local authorities must take resolute and effective steps to change the serious waste of arable land in capital construction, strictly implement the State Council's promulgated measures for land requisition for national construction, and strictly implement the examination and approval system. As everyone knows, it costs more than 1 billion yuan to reclaim 10 million mu of wasteland, and the total output of grain planted annually is about 2 billion jin; the construction occupies 10 million mu of arable land, which is at least equivalent to 1 billion yuan of funds, and the output of crops produced on these cultivated lands far exceeds the output of newly reclaimed wastelands. Therefore, we request that all relevant departments and local authorities resolutely restrict the occupation of arable land, and immediately return the arable land that has been over-occupied and occupied but not used by various construction units to farmers for cultivation. It is recommended that the departments in charge of construction re-study the quotas for construction land for industrial and mining enterprises, schools, and other buildings, reduce the scale of urban construction, and greatly reduce the amount of land occupied; and when it is necessary to occupy land, occupy wasteland and secondary land as much as possible to avoid occupying good arable land. When building reservoirs and other water conservancy projects, careful planning and repeated accounting should be carried out to strive to use less arable land and greatly increase the benefited area. Secondly, it is also necessary to appropriately increase the amount of wasteland reclamation according to the possible conditions of national financial and material resources. When reclaiming wasteland, first reclaim the cultivated wasteland and saline-alkali land in areas with a large population or convenient transportation, because the reclamation and planting of these wastelands will have a faster effect on alleviating the tight grain supply in areas with a high population density. Secondly, reclaim the wasteland in remote areas. When reclaiming wasteland in remote areas, we must fully consider human conditions, transportation conditions, supply possibilities, housing conditions, water supply conditions, and the economic effect of investment. The experience of wasteland reclamation in the past few years has proved that wasteland reclamation in remote areas is a very difficult task. Whether it is food, clothing, housing, or transportation, it is difficult in the first few years. Only after four or five years can the degree of difficulty be gradually reduced and better labor results be obtained. Therefore, whether it is military reclamation or civilian reclamation, when mobilizing people to reclaim land, we must do a good job in political and ideological work, and ask everyone to contribute to the motherland with a spirit of hard work and endurance. The practice of not emphasizing the hardship of wasteland reclamation, only emphasizing the beauty of the prospect, and making promises one-sidedly is wrong. We suggest that the agricultural authorities and local authorities conduct a comprehensive plan for the reclamation of cultivated wasteland and raw wasteland as soon as possible, and implement it step by step according to the possible conditions of the country's financial and material resources.

Further developing China's agriculture is a very big issue, and it is related to a wide range of aspects. The above four points are only a few of the more prominent major problems currently existing. Since 1958 is the starting year of China's Second Five-Year Plan, the backwardness of China's agriculture must be effectively and systematically changed in the future. We especially recommend that relevant departments and local authorities seize the time, plan comprehensively, and implement them gradually.

### 关于发展农业的四点建议

    关于发展农业的四点建议
    在国民经济的发展过程中，现在有一个突出的矛盾，这就是我国农业在解放以来虽然有了很大的发展，但是仍然大大地落后于人民生活的要求，落后于轻工业发展的要求。积极地和正确地解决这一个矛盾，是使我国国民经济进一步高涨的关键。
    毛主席教导我们：“我国是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的80％以上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才能有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。”应该指出，国家计划机关和某些地方当局，过去一般是注意工业较多，注意农业较少。在全国农业发展纲要（草案）公布之后，对于发展农业注意增加了，但有些地方还比不上对于发展工业的注意。今后对于发展工业和发展农业，必须同时并举，同等注意。
    1957年下半年除了必须加强防洪、排涝、锄草、追肥、除虫、护苗、秋收、秋耕等工作，以争取大丰收以外，还必须瞻前顾后，总结经验，为今后几年特别是1958年的农业发展，提早进行妥善的安排。凡是能提早动手的工作都应该提早动手。
    现在我们根据我国第一个五年计划执行的经验和第二个五年计划即将开始的情况，向国家机关的有关部门和地方当局提出四点建议。
    第一、兴修水利，以中小型为主。第一个五年计划期间，我国水利建设，大约以60％的投资用在大型水利方面。毫无疑问，像根治淮河、根治黄河的大型工程是必要的。但是考虑到我国的财政经济状况，要求投资少、收效快，以及我国内涝成灾特别严重的具体情况，在水利建设方面也同工业建设方面一样，今后也应该实行大型、中型、小型相结合，并且以中、小型（其中特别是排涝）为主的方针。根治河流和大型水库的建设，应该全面规划，反复研究，慎重定案，分期进行。对于中型工程、特别是小型工程，只要是经过设计、当年或次年即有显著效益的，应该首先举办。在工程种类方面，防洪和灌溉固然应该重视，可是水土保持和排涝更须摆在首要的位置。我国山区的人口约占全国人口的三分之一，山区（包括丘陵地区）的耕地面积占全国耕地面积将近二分之一。做好水土保持工作，不只是对于山区的农业增产有利，而且可以减少平原地区的洪水为害。水土保持的工作，效果看来是慢的，但是根据陕西、甘肃、山西等省的典型经验，凡是做好工作的地方，当年就能够增加生产，因此必须积极进行。我国水灾（主要是内涝）为害的耕地面积，根据最近八年来的记载，丰收的年份在四至五千万亩左右，平年在六至七千万亩左右，歉年在一亿五千万亩以上。在受灾面积中，由于内涝成灾的每年都在四至五千万亩左右，1956年达一亿二千万亩以上。这些受灾的地区，历年主要都在人口众多、土地肥沃的河北、河南、山东、苏北、皖北等省区。排涝工程比起开荒的工程，所费较少，收效较快。因此，排涝工程不仅应该摆在水利建设的主要日程上，而且应该摆在农业建设的首要地位。我们建议：地方当局和水利部门，目前除了积极防洪以外，分出一部分力量认真规划明年的中、小型水利建设项目，经过国家计划部门的同意以后，争取在今年秋后即着手准备施工的工作。
    第二、增产肥料。用多种多样的办法增积肥料，是当前我国增加肥料来源的有效办法。目前应该加紧压绿肥、锄草垫圈增加厩肥的工作，本报在7月19日的社论中已有论述。从长远打算，增加化学肥料的生产和增加对于农村燃料的供应量，这两项同水利建设结合起来，对于农业的增产具有决定的意义。第一个五年计划期间，我国建设的较大的化学肥料厂共十三个，全部建成后，可以年产氮肥一百零六万吨、过磷酸钙六十四万吨、磷矿粉三十六万吨。在今后两三年内，除过把这些已经开始建设的企业迅速建成投入生产以外，还应该建设大量的中、小型化学肥料工厂。这些工厂的建设，基本上应该自力设计，自力制造设备，以达到投资少、收效快的目的。我们建议：国家机关的有关部门结合地方当局，对于化肥工厂的厂型、地区分布、设备制造、原料供应和产品品种、建设先后等等迅速进行全面规划，逐步实施，务求五年到七年间我国化学肥料的生产有突飞猛进的增长。同增产肥料有密切关系的是增加地方小窑煤矿的开采。增加对于农村供应煤炭的数量，可以节省出大量的植物燃料、饲料，因而也可以增加肥料，并且增加高产作物的种植面积。目前我国生产的煤炭总数中，大约有三分之一是供应农村的，数量已经不算少，但还远不能满足农村的需要。随着我国工业和运输事业的发展，煤炭的需要量，每年都有一千万吨以上的增加。因此，今后现代煤矿工业的建设和生产的增加，主要应该满足不断增长的工业和运输事业的需要，不可能像过去那样大量增加对农村的供应量。那么，怎样增加农村需要煤炭的供应量呢？由于我国煤炭资源丰富，民间又有多年的开采经验，分散开采小矿，节省运输，便于供应。因此，今后农村用煤，以实行地方自给为主、中央抽补为辅的方针为好。1957年国家开放了小窑煤矿的开采和鼓励地方增产煤炭的政策，地方煤炭的产量将比1956年增加五百八十万吨以上，可见潜力是很大的。因此，我们建议地方当局，根据本省、本县的煤炭资源情况、人民开采的传统经验和运输条件，有计划地发动和组织群众开采，以增加产量和增加对农村的供应量。地方煤矿的投资和经营方式可以是多种多样的，农业生产合作社作为副业的经营方式，县、省投资经营都可采用。
    第三、增产粮食和增产棉花兼顾。在我国还不能大量扩大耕地面积以前，为了增产粮食，适当保证人民消费增长的需要，一般地不再扩大工业原料作物的种植面积是必要的和正确的。但是穿衣也必须适当保证。根据初步统计，1957年全国棉田种植面积约八千七百万亩，比1956年的九千三百八十万亩减少了六百八十万亩，这就比较显著地影响到棉花产量的增加和下年度纱布的增产。因此，棉田种植面积继续缩小是否适当，值得研究。为了适当满足我国人民不断增长的衣着需要，今后应该大力发展合成纤维工业和开辟棉花以外的其他纤维的资源。我们建议化学工业部门立即着手规划我国合成纤维工业的远景发展计划，并且在明后年内即开始进行试点建设。纺织工业和造纸工业部门对于节约木材、合理利用棉短绒、甘蔗渣、棉秸及其他纤维原料，应该作全面的经济和技术的研究，逐步减少造纸工业的木材、棉绒、麻皮的使用数量，用这些好材料增产纺织工业品。但是这些措施较大的成效最短也在三、五年之后，因此，三、五年内纺织工业的主要原料还是棉花。我们考虑，今后几年内我国棉花的种植面积应该稳定在去年和今年种植的水平上。粮食作物种植面积的扩大，更多地依靠水土保持、排涝、开垦荒地来解决。这一点特别建议河北、河南、江苏、山东等植棉特多的省份加以考虑。
    第四、扩大耕地面积。首先，国家机关的有关部门和地方当局，必须采取坚决的和有效的步骤，改变基本建设中浪费耕地的严重情况，严格执行国务院公布的关于国家建设征用土地办法和严格执行审批制度。大家知道，开垦一千万亩荒地要花人民币十亿元以上，全部种植粮食每年生产约二十亿斤左右；建设占用耕地一千万亩，至少等于十亿元的资金，这些熟地生产的农作物，则远远超过新垦荒地的产量。因此，我们要求各有关部门和地方当局坚决限制占用耕地，把各建设单位多占的和占而不用的耕地，立即退还给农民耕种。建议主管建设的部门，重新研究工矿企业、学校及其他建筑用地的定额，缩小城市建设的规模，大量减少占用土地的数量；并且在必须占用土地的时候，尽可能地占用荒地、次地，避免占用好的耕地。在兴建水库和其他水利工程的时候，应该仔细规划，反复核算，力求少用耕地，大大地增加受益面积。其次，根据国家财力、物力的可能条件，适当增加开垦荒地的数量也是必要的。在开垦荒地的时候，先开垦人口较多或者交通较便的地区的熟荒地、盐碱地，因为这些荒地开垦种植之后，对于缓和人口密度较大的地区的粮食供应紧张情况，会较快地收到效果。其次再开垦边远地区的荒地。在开垦边远地区的荒地的时候，必须充分考虑人力条件、运输条件、供应可能、住宅条件、供水条件和投资的经济效果。过去几年开荒的经验证明，在边远地区开荒是一件十分艰苦的工作，无论食、衣、住、行，在开始几年都是艰苦的，要经过四、五年之后，才能逐步减轻艰苦的程度，得到较好的劳动果实。因此，无论是军垦、民垦，在动员人们去开垦的时候，都必须做好政治思想工作，要大家以艰苦耐劳的精神，为祖国贡献一分力量，那种不强调开荒的艰苦，只强调远景的美丽而片面地许愿的做法是不对的。我们建议，农业主管部门和地方当局，对于开垦熟荒地和生荒地迅速进行全面规划，根据国家的财力、物力可能条件，逐步实行。
    进一步发展我国农业的问题是一个很大的问题，联系方面很广。上述四项，只是当前存在的比较突出的几个大问题。由于1958年是我国第二个五年计划的开始年度，我国农业落后的情况，今后必须有效地和有步骤地予以改变，特建议有关部门和地方当局，抓紧时间，全面规划，逐步实行。
