Moscow, July 27th (via this newspaper's dispatch) The festival opens today (the 28th). Currently, youth representatives from over a hundred countries have arrived within the Soviet border, and tens of thousands more young people from various nations are on their way to Moscow. On the 26th, the people of Moscow welcomed youth guests from over thirty countries at the Kiev Railway Station. These days, on the streets of Moscow, one can see Indian girls wearing saris, Chinese girls in cheongsams, Mexican students in wide-brimmed hats, and Soviet youth in various national costumes... The joyful songs of young people from various countries have begun to fly everywhere in this city.

Talented Soviet artists have ingeniously decorated the city in a way that is both beautiful and generous. Over two hundred squares, streets, and pocket parks are beautifully adorned. From the Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition to the Road to Happiness at the Central Stadium under Lenin Hills, the scene is truly magnificent: Along "Peace Street" (i.e., Yaroslavl Highway), there are posters with the word "Peace" written in various languages and countless flags embroidered with peace doves. On "Labor Street" (i.e., First Citizen Street), images of peasants and miners, shepherds and fishermen, divers and explorers, scientists and musicians... all kinds of working people appear. At one end of "Friendship Street" (i.e., Garden Ring Road), national flags of various countries flutter in the wind, and at the other end, in the heart of the street, stands a giant statue of youth wearing the costumes of the fifteen Soviet republics. On the 28th, the teams of young people from various countries will step across this road of peace and friendship, heading towards the venue.

In Dzerzhinsky Square, the flying carpet arranged according to Russian folk tales makes you feel interesting and novel. On the streets next to the square, large-scale scientific posters showing rockets taking off and atomic ships breaking through the ice are posted, attracting people to explore the mysteries of the universe and nature.

Even more unique is the "Literary Street" arranged on Gogol Boulevard, where you come here as if reading a history of Russian and Soviet literature. On both sides of the boulevard, green trees hide dozens of huge models of famous Soviet literary works with exquisite illustrations, various characters from books you are familiar with such as "The Tale of Igor's Campaign," "Eugene Onegin," "Anna Karenina," "Mother," "Quiet Flows the Don," and "The Young Guard" appear before your eyes one by one. On "Music Street," which is set up on Herzen Street, banners with musical scores are hung high in the street, and instrument models are placed next to the street, making you feel as if you are enjoying a moving piece of music.

The layout of Uprising Square is the most thought-provoking. On a dilapidated high wall, one side is painted with a huge plume of smoke from an atomic bomb explosion, and the other side is painted with smoky Stalingrad and Port Said, the broken walls and ruins of Pyongyang and Coventry, ... In front of this high wall, a statue of a mother and child stands solemnly, the mother's hand making a "no" gesture, reaching forward, as if she is telling the young people of all countries: "This must never happen again!"

Peace and friendship have spread throughout the streets and alleys of Moscow, and into every household. Even every window in this city has been decorated. Starting from the 28th, millions of citizens of Moscow will celebrate this festival of youth together with young people from more than one hundred and forty countries around the world.

    各国青年客人云集　欢乐歌声到处飞扬
    世界青年联欢节今在莫斯科开幕
    本报莫斯科27日电　联欢节今天（28日）开幕了。现在，一百多个国家的青年代表们已经到达了苏联国境，还有各国上万青年正在前来莫斯科的路上。26日这一天，莫斯科人又在基辅车站迎接了三十多个国家的青年客人。这些天在莫斯科街头可以看到披着沙丽的印度少女，穿着旗袍的中国姑娘，戴着阔边帽的墨西哥学生，穿着各种民族服装的苏联青年……。各国年青人的欢乐的歌声开始在这个城市里到处飞扬。
  　多才多艺的苏联艺术家，别出心裁地把这座城市打扮得既美丽又大方。两百多广场、街道和街心花园装饰得漂亮得很。工农业展览馆到列宁山下的中央体育场的幸福路上，真是气象万千：“和平街”（即雅罗斯拉夫大道）两旁装饰着用各国文字写着“和平”字样的招贴画和无数绣着和平鸽的旗子。“劳动街”（即第一市民街）上出现了农妇和矿工、牧人和渔夫、潜水员和勘探员、科学家和音乐家……各种劳动人民的形象。在“友谊街”（即花园环形大道）的一头，各国国旗迎风招展，另一头街心中竖立起穿着苏联十五个加盟共和国的服装的青年巨像。二十八日，各国青年的队伍，将踏过这条和平和友谊的幸福之路，走向会场。
    在捷尔任斯基广场上，根据俄罗斯民间故事布置起来的飞毯，使你感到有趣而新奇。在广场旁边的街头上，张贴着表现火箭腾空和原子船破冰前进的大幅科学招贴画，在吸引人去探测宇宙和大自然的奥秘。
    更加别致的是在果戈里林荫路上布置起来的“文学街”，你来到这里简直等于读一本俄罗斯和苏联的文学史。林荫路的两旁，绿树掩映着几十个挂着精美插图的苏联文学名著的巨大的模型，一座你所熟悉的“伊戈尔王子出征记”“欧根·奥涅金”“安娜·卡列尼娜”“母亲”“静静的顿河”“青年近卫军”等书中的各式人物，一个个出现在你的眼前。在赫尔岑大街上布置起来的“音乐街”上，高悬街中的是写着乐谱的横幅，乐器模型放在街旁，使你仿佛欣赏了一首动人的乐曲。
    起义广场的布置最能引人深思。一所残破的高墙上，一面画着原子弹爆炸时巨大的烟柱，一面画着烟火弥漫的斯大林格勒和塞得港，断壁残垣的平壤和考文垂，……。在这个高墙前面，庄严地树立着一个母与子雕像，母亲的一只手作着“不许”的姿势，伸向前方，她仿佛告诉各国青年们：“决不许此事重演！”
    和平和友谊已经走遍了莫斯科的大街和小巷，走遍了家家户户。在这个城市里甚至每一个窗口都装饰起来了。从二十八日起，莫斯科的几百万市民将同来自世界各地的一百四十多个国家的青年一起开始欢度这个青春的节日。
