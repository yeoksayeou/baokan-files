    Poetry Handbill
    This is a Perilous Battle
    Jing Yandun
    This is a perilous battle,
    Happening while we sing!
    Fiercely waged in the bright sunshine,
    Victory decided on future goals!
    This is a perilous battle,
    Happening while we sing!
    Arise, passionate warriors,
    The motherland calls to you earnestly!
    It cannot entrust its fate to the Rightists,
    Cannot fall into the treasonous plot!
    The leadership of the Communist Party cannot be shaken,
    The lesson learned for this was countless heads!
    Catching the Fox Demon
    Yan Ling
    Wagging, wagging, wagging,
    Tail wagging eight zhang high.
    Wagging in the air, swaying,
    Fox stench spreading throughout the city.
    Annoyed at the fox stench,
    Pick up steel forks and iron picks.
    Everyone come to catch the fox demon,
    Don't let it slip away!
    Clamp, clamp, clamp,
    The fox clamps its rotten tail.
    "I didn't mean to release toxic gas,
    Just that my tail was itchy!"
    Beating chest and stamping feet, wailing,
    Only because its stinky fur was pulled.
    When you soften your heart and loosen your grip,
    It will return to its lair to sharpen its teeth!
    Catch, catch, catch,
    Don't let the fox demon return to its lair.
    Make it forsake evil and return to the righteous path,
    From now on, no more being unruly!
    Keep it in the zoo,
    Give it food and drink,
    Everyone learn to recognize the fox,
    See how it drags its tail.
    Rightist Portrait
    Rui Hongzhuo
    I'll help you
    You first put down your weapons
    I'll help you
    You close your eyes tightly
    I'll help you
    You bind your hands firmly
    Let me draw my white knife
        ——To help you
    (Beijing University Poetry Journal "Red Building")

    诗传单
    这是一场险恶的战斗
    井岩盾
    这是一场险恶的战斗，
    发生在我们歌唱的时候！
    在明媚的阳光里激烈进行，
    在未来的目标上决定胜负！
    这是一场险恶的战斗，
    发生在我们歌唱的时候！
    热情的战士们站起来啊，
    祖国向你们殷切唤呼！
    它不能把命运交给右派，
    不能陷入卖国的阴谋！
    共产党的领导不能动摇，
    换来这教训是无数人头！
    捉狐妖
    燕凌
    翘呀翘，翘呀翘，
    尾巴翘得八丈高。
    翘到空中摇呀摇，
    狐臭散得满城臊。
    闻到狐臭心里恼，
    拿起钢叉和铁镐。
    大家都来捉狐妖，
    切莫叫它溜掉了！
    夹呀夹，夹呀夹，
    狐狸夹起烂尾巴。
    “我本无心放毒气
    不过尾巴发痒啦！”
    捶胸顿足号啕哭，
    只因臭毛被人拔。
    等你心软手放松，
    它又回窝去磨牙！
    捉呀捉，捉呀捉，
    不许狐妖回老窝。
    要它改邪来归正，
    从此不许再撒泼！
    动物园里养着它，
    给它吃来给它喝，
    人人学会认狐狸，
    看它尾巴怎样拖。
    右派肖像
    芮虹灼
    我帮助你
    你先放下武器
    我帮助你
    你把两眼紧闭
    我帮助你
    你把双手缚牢
    让我抽出白刀
        ——帮助你
    （北京大学诗刊“红楼”）
