I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Our Huangtugang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beijing, which started as a mutual aid team of only three households in 1951, has developed into an advanced cooperative of 2,003 households after several years. Since cooperativization last year, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, the members have been highly enthusiastic about production, converting more than 2,080 mu of dry land into paddy fields (including 450 mu of low-lying and barren land turned into paddy fields, with the yield per mu increasing from the previous 30-40 jin to an average of 360 jin after becoming paddy fields). With the help of the state, our cooperative installed 44 electric water pumps, dug four electric wells, installed eight electric mills, and also installed telephones and a wired broadcasting network. People can hear about national events and entertainment programs every day within a range of 14 li from north to south and 8 li from east to west in our township. Things that we never dared to dream of in the past have now been realized. Before liberation, our township only had 250 primary school students, and the children of poor peasants could not afford to go to school. Now our township has 1,000 primary school students and more than 120 middle school students, which shows that the culture of the peasants has also been greatly improved. The 83 households of elderly, weak, orphaned, and disabled people in our township have also received the "Five Guarantees" treatment, and their lives have been taken care of.

Last year, due to excessive rainfall, our cooperative suffered a severe flood that had not been seen in decades. Out of the 17,080 mu of land in the entire cooperative, 12,000 mu were severely affected, of which more than 7,000 mu were the most severely affected, yielding only 10% or even no harvest. Although we suffered such a severe flood, because we gave full play to the advantages of cooperativization, the lives of the members were fully guaranteed. No one in the entire cooperative went hungry, and no one ate chaff. They ate pure rice and pure flour. Seven hundred houses collapsed in the flood last year, and new houses have now been rebuilt. Since liberation, our township has built more than 1,000 new houses, many of which are brick houses. Last spring, the state lent our cooperative 140,000 yuan, plus electricity loans. We ran the cooperative diligently and economized. After such a heavy flood, our cooperative not only did not borrow a penny from the state this year, but has already repaid 134,000 yuan of state loans. These facts are ironclad proof that makes the members even more aware of the benefits of cooperativization. Some members said, "The cooperative is good. If it weren't for the cooperative, all the land would be flooded, and we wouldn't even be able to harvest the seeds, let alone have congee to drink." Some members said, "We still have to say that the cooperative is good. When there is flooding, there are high lands; when it is neither dry nor flooded, there is flat land." Some said, "If it weren't for the cooperative, I don't know how many households would have fled the famine, begged for food, and had no clothes to wear." The members recalled that in 1943, during the Japanese occupation, they ate "co-prosperity flour." Because they were hungry and had nothing to eat, poor peasant Liu Rulin pulled two carrots from the landlord's field and was sent to prison by the local tyrant landlord, where he was tortured. Liu Rulin and his son Dadan died in prison like this. Liu Rulin's mother, an old woman in her seventies or eighties, also died in grief. Liu Rulin's wife fled to Zhangjiakou, and his child was given away. The whole family was separated. Now Liu Rulin's wife has returned from Zhangjiakou and has grandchildren. How good is liberation, how good is land reform, how good is cooperativization, how good is socialism? Aren't these all facts? The right-wingers say that "cooperativization has been messed up," that "the lives of the peasants have not improved," and that "the unified purchase and sales system has been messed up." They are all not looking at the facts and are talking nonsense. After the members heard the news through newspapers and radio broadcasts, they were extremely angry at the right-wingers. The members said, "If it weren't for the unified purchase and sales system, we would have starved to death in such a flood last year because we would not have had enough food to eat." Some members said angrily, "The state cannot give the right-wingers free food and drink. They eat and drink ours, and they still hate us. Don't give them anything to eat or drink!" Some members said, "We have to let the right-wingers go to the countryside to see for themselves, let them work. If they don't work, they don't know the situation and talk nonsense with their eyes open!" We warn the right-wingers: We peasants will always be of one heart with the Communist Party, and we only have this one broad road of socialism. Whoever dares to oppose socialism, we will crush their spines!

    谁要敢反对社会主义我们就要打碎他的脊骨
    殷维臣的发言
    我完全同意周总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长的报告。
    我们北京市黄土岗农业生产合作社，由一九五一年只有三户的互助组，经过几年的发展，现在已经是二千零三户的高级社了。去年合作化以后，社员在共产党、毛主席和人民政府的英明领导下生产情绪很高，把二千零八十多亩旱地改为水地（其中有四百五十亩是洼地、荒地变为稻田，每亩产量从以前的三、四十斤增加到变稻田后每亩平均产量三百六十斤）。在国家的帮助下，我们社安装了四十四个电力水泵，打了四眼电井，安了八盘电磨，还安上了电话和有线广播网，全乡南北十四里东西八里内每天都能听到国家大事和文娱节目。真是从前不敢梦想的事，现在也实现了。解放前我乡只有小学生二百五十人，那时贫农的子女是上不起学的。现在我乡有小学生一千人，上中学有一百二十多人，这说明农民的文化也大大提高了。我乡老弱孤寡的八十三户，也受到了五保待遇，生活都得到了照顾。
    去年因为雨水过大，我们社受了几十年未有的严重涝灾。全社一万七千零八十亩土地中，有一万二千亩受了重灾，其中最重的七千多亩，只收了一成甚至颗粒未收。虽然受了这样严重的涝灾，因为发挥了合作化的优越性，社员的生活完全有保证。全社没有一个挨饿的，也没有吃糠的，吃的是净米净面，去年涝灾里倒塌了房子七百间，现在都修盖了新房。解放以来我乡共盖了新房一千多间，其中好多是砖房。去年春天国家贷给我们社贷款十四万元，另外还有电力贷款，我们勤俭办社、努力节约，经过这样重的涝灾，今年我们社不但没有借国家一块钱，到现在已经归还了国家贷款十三万四千元。这些事实，就是铁一样的证明，使得社员们更加认识了合作化的好处。有的社员说：“还是合作社好，要不是合作社，地全泡了，连籽也收不回来，连粥也喝不上。”有的社员说：“还得说合作社好，涝了有高地，不旱不涝有平川地。”有的说：“要不是有合作社，不知道有多少户逃荒、要饭、穿不上衣裳。”社员们想起一九四三年日本占领时期吃共合面那年，因为挨饿没的吃，贫农刘汝林上地主的地里拔了两根胡罗卜，就被恶霸地主送到监狱里，非刑拷打，刘汝林和他儿子大旦就这样死在监狱里了，刘汝林的母亲，七、八十岁的老太太也急死了，刘汝林的妻子逃荒到张家口去了，他的小孩给了人，一家子妻离子散。现在刘汝林的妻子由张家口回来了，也抱了孙子了。解放了多么好，土地改革多么好，合作化多么好，社会主义多么好，这不都是事实吗？右派分子说什么“合作化搞糟了”，“农民生活没有改善”，“统购统销搞糟了”，全是不看事实，一派胡言乱语，社员们听了读报和广播以后，对右派分子气愤极了。社员们说：“要是没有统购统销，去年这样涝灾，我们吃不上粮食就得饿死。”有的社员气得说：“国家不能给右派分子白吃白喝，他吃着我们，喝着我们，还恨我们，不给他吃喝！”有的社员说：“得让右派分子下农村来看一看，让他们来劳动，他不劳动不知道情况，睁着眼胡说！”我们警告右派分子：我们农民和共产党永远一条心，我们只有社会主义这一条平川大道。谁要敢反对社会主义，我们就要打碎他的脊骨！
