How to Ensure Normal Vegetable Supply During the Off-Season
The Key Lies in Planting More Autumn Vegetables

    The season for sowing autumn vegetables is approaching. In order to ensure a normal supply of vegetables to the people in cities and industrial and mining areas during the winter and spring off-season, cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and various parts of Jilin Province have already formulated plans to expand autumn vegetable production early and have studied several relevant issues in expanding autumn vegetable production to ensure the smooth completion of the production increase plan. The seven districts of Beijing's suburbs plan to sow 145,640 mu of autumn vegetables this year, an increase of about 40,000 mu compared to last year; it is estimated that this year's vegetable production will be 908.37 million jin, an increase of nearly 300 million jin compared to last year.

    Of the autumn vegetables sown in Beijing this year, 70% are Chinese cabbage and radish, and the rest are potherb mustard, mustard greens, spinach, autumn cucumbers, and autumn hyacinth beans.

    With the support of the state, vegetable cooperatives in the suburbs of Beijing have received 900,000 yuan in advance purchase deposits and commercial fertilizers for developing vegetable production. According to market demand, Tianjin plans to plant 83,000 mu of autumn vegetables this year, requiring a total autumn vegetable output of 470 million jin. The main varieties planned for sowing are Chinese cabbage, spinach, scallions, green radish, white radish, drought-resistant radish, carrots, mustard greens, and potherb mustard.

    In order to ensure the completion of the autumn vegetable production task, the relevant departments in Tianjin have solved the problems of lack of funds, fertilizers, and seeds for horticultural cooperatives, and have also made regulations on vegetable price guarantees and seasonal price differences. With the support of the state, farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang are taking measures such as increasing the number of wells and exchanging improved varieties to expand the autumn vegetable planting area. According to estimates, the area of ​​autumn vegetables in the suburbs this year can be expanded to 3,700 hectares, with an estimated output of 150,000 to 160,000 tons. This year's autumn vegetable area has expanded by about 60% compared to last year, and the output is about double that of last year.

    In order to ensure the completion of the task of increasing autumn vegetable production, relevant departments in Shenyang have taken corresponding measures. The Municipal Vegetable Company has formulated advance purchase methods and will implement advance purchases of Chinese cabbage produced in the suburbs. In order to ensure the normal supply of vegetables during the off-season this winter and next spring, Taiyuan will have an autumn vegetable planting area of ​​69,252 mu this year, an increase of about 10% over the previous year. Calculated at an average vegetable yield of 2,836 jin per mu, it is estimated that 196.444 million jin of Chinese cabbage, radish, scallions, potatoes (summer-sown and autumn-harvested), etc., can be produced. Excluding the part for farmers' own consumption and losses, 11.0157 million jin of commercial vegetables will be available on the market. At present, the Municipal Vegetable Company is signing production and sales contracts with vegetable production cooperatives in accordance with the above plan. Jilin Province has a short frost-free period and limited seasons for growing vegetables. For six or seven months of the year, it relies on storage methods to supply vegetables. If fewer autumn vegetables are planted, the amount of vegetable reserves in winter and early spring will be reduced, which is very detrimental to the lives of the majority of urban and county residents. Therefore, the Jilin Provincial People's Committee issued instructions requiring all localities to strengthen leadership and do a good job in autumn vegetable planting. The instructions require cities such as Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Liaoyuan, and Tonghua, as well as the counties surrounding them, to support each other, strengthen ties, and do a good job in vegetable production planning to ensure the yield and variety of vegetables.

    怎样保证蔬菜淡季供应正常
    关键在于多种秋菜
    播种秋菜的季节就要到了。为了保证城市和工矿区人民今冬明春蔬菜淡季供应正常，北京、天津、沈阳、太原等城市和吉林省各地，已经提早制定了扩大秋菜生产的计划，研究了扩大秋菜生产中的若干有关问题，以保证增产计划能够顺利完成。北　京市郊七个区计划今年播种秋菜十四万五千六百四十亩，比去年扩大四万亩左右；预计今年可产菜九亿零八百三十七万斤，比去年增加近三亿斤。
    北京市今年播种的秋菜70％是大白菜和萝卜，其余部分是雪里红、芥菜、菠菜、秋黄瓜、秋扁豆等。
    在国家支援下，北京市郊各蔬菜合作社已获得九十万元发展蔬菜生产的预购定金和商品肥料。天　津根据市场需求情况，今年计划种植八万三千亩秋菜，要求秋菜总产量达到四亿七千斤。计划播种的主要品种是：大白菜、菠菜、大葱、青萝卜、白萝卜、旱萝卜、胡萝卜、芥菜和雪里红。
    为了保证秋菜生产任务的完成，天津市有关部门解决了园田社缺少资金、肥料和种子等问题，并对蔬菜的保价、季节差价等问题作了规定。沈　阳郊区的农民在国家的支援下，正采取增设水井、串换良种等措施扩大秋菜播种面积。根据预计，今年市郊秋菜的面积可以扩大到三千七百公顷，预计产量是十五万吨到十六万吨。今年秋菜的面积比去年扩大60％左右，产量约比去年增加一倍。
    为了保证增产秋菜任务的完成，沈阳市各有关部门采取了相应的措施。市蔬菜公司订出预购办法，将对郊区生产的白菜实行预购。太
　原为了保证今冬明春淡季的蔬菜正常供应，今年秋菜播种面积将达到六万九千二百五十二亩，比上年约增加10％。按每亩平均产菜二千八百三十六斤计算，预计可产白菜、萝卜、大葱、马铃薯（是夏播秋收的）等一亿九千六百四十四万斤，除农民自食和损耗部分外，将有一亿零一百五十七万斤商品菜上市。目前市蔬菜公司正在和蔬菜生产社按照上述计划订立产销合同。吉林省无霜期短，生长蔬菜的节季有限。一年有六、七个月是依靠储备的办法来供应蔬菜的。秋菜种得少，冬天和初春的蔬菜储备量就要减少，这对于广大城市和县城居民的生活很不利。因此吉林省人民委员会发出指示，要求各地加强领导，做好秋菜播种工作。指示要求长春、吉林、四平、辽源和通化等城市以及它们周围的县，要互相支援，加强联系，做好蔬菜生产规划，保证蔬菜的产量和品种。（本报综合消息）＊名　辞　解　释＊
            什么是秋菜
    这里所说的秋菜，是指北方地区在晚夏或入秋播种，当年11月间收获的蔬菜。秋菜的种类主要是：大白菜、萝卜、胡萝卜、芥菜、蔓菁、菠菜等。
    秋菜可以在园田里栽种，也可以在大田里栽种。河北、河南、山西、山东等地区的农民多有在大田里栽种萝卜、芥菜的经验。
    秋菜一般耐储藏，储藏期有些可以长到半年。
