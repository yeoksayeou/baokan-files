How Rightists Set Fires in the Peking Opera World
Chinese Peking Opera Theatre, Li Huifang

We have already seen from the newspapers the anti-socialist conspiratorial activities carried out by the rightist Chen Renbing in the Shanghai Peking Opera circles. In Beijing, the Zhang-Luo alliance also carried out similar conspiracies in the Chinese Peking Opera Theatre.

On June 5th and June 13th, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party convened two symposiums for Peking Opera and ballad singers. Some of our actors and comrades were very surprised when they received the invitations, thinking: the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has never had any contact with us, what are they inviting us to a meeting for? Later, we learned that "it was to help the Communist Party with the rectification campaign." We have always trusted the democratic parties, believing them to be progressive organizations that "coexist for a long time and supervise each other" with the Communist Party, so helping the Party with the rectification campaign is naturally a good thing. Therefore, we accepted the invitation to attend the symposium.

The first symposium on June 5th was held at the Political Consultative Conference Cultural Club on Nanheyan Street. The second symposium was held on June 13th at the Beijing Hotel. The first invitation was issued in the names of Ye Gongchuo, Li Boqiu, Li Jiansheng, and Li Wanchun. Why was Ye Gongchuo there? At the beginning of the symposium, Li Boqiu introduced that Mr. Ye had joined the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party at the beginning of the rectification campaign. This made it clear that the rightists wanted to use Mr. Ye's name to establish a relationship with Peking Opera actors, and then launch their conspiracy.

Li Wanchun also played the role of a wire-puller here. Ye Shengchang, a comrade from our theatre, seemed to be very active, and he was the contact point for many actors in our theatre. They were extremely polite to the actors who attended the symposium, using cars to pick them up and drop them off. Some were even kept behind for a lavish dinner.

At the beginning of the symposium, several old gentlemen spoke, talking about issues related to artistic reform. The rightists saw this "gentle breeze and fine rain" scene and felt that it did not suit their intentions. At that time, a man named Xing Wenxin (who seemed to be working as a secretary or clerk) passed a note to Ye Shengchang, so they signaled each other and the topic changed. Then, actors from our theatre spoke. Some said: they didn't dare to talk at the symposium held by the People's Daily, and they didn't dare to talk inside the Peking Opera Theatre. Today, with the support of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, they have dispelled their worries and are not afraid of anything. Thus, some actors who had "dispelled their worries" made many slanders and attacks against the Chinese Peking Opera Theatre. Some said that the reason why the national opera circles are not doing well and why there are many serious shortcomings is due to the Chinese Peking Opera Theatre, and the reason why the Chinese Peking Opera Theatre is not good is because the deputy director, Communist Party member Ma Shaobo, is not leading well, that is, the Communist Party is not leading well. Some even said that the Peking Opera circles cannot see the light of day unless Ma Shaobo is overthrown. Others said that the Chinese Peking Opera Theatre has the atmosphere of a concentration camp and an iron curtain. When these people spoke, Li Wanchun constantly chimed in and applauded, and pretended to be surprised and said: So your Chinese Peking Opera Theatre is so dark!

The people who spoke at the meeting had personal feelings, and their words became more and more detached from the facts. They only wanted to enjoy themselves for a while and win the "sympathy" of the "host", but this was exactly what the "host" wanted. At that time, I thought: where is this exposing contradictions and helping the Party with the rectification campaign? Isn't this just lying through one's teeth?

Halfway through the meeting, Huang Qixiang rushed over, and Zhang Bojun also rushed over despite the pain of having just had a tooth extracted, showing that the rightists attached great importance to winning over the Peking Opera circles. Zhang bowed to everyone as he entered the door and said, "Thank you for your hard work." Li Jiansheng (Zhang Bojun's wife) immediately reported to him that today's meeting was going very well. It turned out that what the rightists wanted was this kind of symposium that attacked the Party's leadership and vilified the Party as much as possible. What we thought was terrible, they said was very good.

Zhang Bojun expressed his concern for the actors and said that our actors have a mass base. Looking back today, when he said this, on the one hand, he was putting a high hat on us, and on the other hand, if we caused trouble, it would have a great impact on the masses, and it would be easy to pull the masses to the right wing through us. This makes us even more aware of why the rightists are working so hard to set fires in the opera circles.

They held such meetings in an organized and planned manner. This is even more obvious from the second symposium held on June 13th. At the first symposium, the people hosting the meeting raised the question of who to invite to participate next time. What they cared about most was to find more "dissatisfied elements" to complain and to express opinions against the Party's leadership. Obviously, someone later gave them a list, and some comrades from our theatre were invited to participate again for the second time. These newly invited people were mostly those who they thought usually had some personal emotions and were dissatisfied with the organization.

This meeting was held after the People's Daily published an editorial exposing the activities of the rightists. At the beginning of the meeting, Li Boqiu, in response to the People's Daily's editorial, said: "There are criticisms outside, and there are also counter-criticisms. Some people say that this is not letting go but tightening up. Some people dare not let go and keep their words in their stomachs, but there are still people who dare to continue to let go. The problem is that a minority cannot ask people supported by the majority to step down. It's like an actor performing on stage, most people like it, and he can't step down just because a few people ask him to step down; but the majority cannot kick out the minority who have different opinions. Some people did not ask to step down, but the opinions put forward were sharper. It is unfair to criticize such people as people who are asking to step down." The implication of these words is very clear today. It is also very clear what he is referring to by criticism, stepping down, the majority and the minority.

After his opening remarks, the people who were invited, under his call, spoke one after another. Some people's speeches were not in accordance with the facts, but many people also made some correct comments on the Peking Opera Theatre. According to the rightists' arrangements, they originally hoped that this time would be more lively than last time, and more fires would be set, but the people who were invited could not tell more "bad things". Li Boqiu was very disappointed, so in the end he had to make the excuse that "it was getting late" and ended it hastily.

While the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party was setting fires in the Peking Opera circles, it was also taking the opportunity to develop a large number of party members. This is fully in line with the plan to develop millions of party members with ulterior motives. Some actors actually filled out forms under their temptation and could not refuse. An application was submitted on June 12th, and on the 13th it was announced that it had been approved for membership (this comrade declared on the 18th that he wanted to withdraw from the party). The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party also has a set of methods, that is, to promise preferential treatment to some actors with prestige, and after joining the party, they can become members of the Central Committee. It turns out that in order to achieve their goals, they are so generous in giving political gifts!

Some of our actor comrades are politically numb, and the rightists in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party have seized on this weakness, wooing us and using us as their tools. Some of our actor comrades do have opinions about the leadership of the theatre, and many of the opinions are correct and necessary to put forward, but they should be based on facts and should not talk nonsense. They should stand firm and put forward positive opinions in order to improve Peking Opera. It is very dangerous to have an unstable position and be wooed and instigated by the rightists and start to move around. If the Party had not promptly led the anti-rightist struggle, many people would have been fooled by the rightists. I hope that those actor comrades who have been fooled will dare to expose how they were wooed and fooled.

    右派分子怎样在京剧界放火
    中国京剧院　李慧芳
    我们从报纸上已经看到右派分子陈仁炳在上海京剧界所进行的反社会主义的阴谋活动。在北京，章罗联盟在中国京剧院也进行了同样的阴谋活动。
    6月5日和6月13日，由农工民主党出面先后召开了两次京剧、曲艺演员座谈会。我们一些演员同志接到请帖时，都觉得很奇怪，心想：农工党和我们素无来往，请我们开什么会呢？后来一问，才知道“是帮助共产党整风”。我们向来对民主党派是信任的，认为它们都是和共产党“长期共存、互相监督”的进步组织，帮助党整风，自然是好事。因此就应邀出席座谈会了。
    6月5日的第一次座谈会是在南河沿政协文化俱乐部举行的。第二次座谈会是6月13日在北京饭店举行的。第一次请柬上由叶恭绰、李伯球、李健生、李万春四人出名。为什么有叶恭绰呢？座谈会一开始，李伯球就介绍，叶老先生是整风开始时参加农工民主党的。这就清楚了，右派分子是想借重叶老的名字和京剧演员拉上关系，然后再展开他们的阴谋活动。
    李万春在这里也起了引线的作用。我院的叶盛长同志看来也很活跃，对我院许多演员的联系都是通过他的。他们对参加座谈的演员们客气极了，用小汽车接送。有的还留下来，吃了丰盛的晚餐。
    座谈开始的时候，有几位老先生发言，谈的都是些艺术改革上的问题，右派分子眼看这种“和风细雨”的场面，不合他们的心意，当时有个叫邢文新的（似乎是做秘书、干事工作的人）递条子给叶盛长，于是他们互相示意，话题就转了。接着就由我院的演员发言。他们有的说：在人民日报召开的座谈会上不敢谈，在京剧院内部不敢谈，今天有了农工民主党的支持，才打消顾虑，什么都不怕了。于是“打破顾虑”的某些演员就对中国京剧院进行很多诬蔑和攻击。有的说，全国戏曲界所以搞不好，所以存在许多严重的缺点，是由于中国京剧院的关系，而中国京剧院所以不好是因为副院长、共产党员马少波领导得不好，也就是共产党领导得不好。甚至说，不打倒马少波京剧界不能大放光明。还有的说，中国京剧院有集中营的味道，有铁幕。在这些人发言的时候，李万春不断地帮腔喝采，并故做惊讶地说：原来你们中国京剧院这么黑暗哪！
    在场发言的人是有个人情绪的，话说得愈来愈脱离事实，只想痛快一时博得“主人”的“同情”，可是这正中“主人”的下怀。当时我心里想：这哪儿是揭发矛盾，帮助党整风呢？这不是睁着眼睛说瞎话吗？
    会进行一半的时候，黄琪翔赶来了，章伯钧刚拔完了牙也不顾痛地匆忙赶来了，可见右派分子对于争取京剧界是很重视的。章进门就向大家拱手，并说：“辛苦辛苦”。李健生（章伯钧的爱人）当即向他汇报说，今天的会开得很好。原来右派分子要的就是这种攻击党的领导、把党骂得愈臭愈好的座谈会。我们觉得糟透了的，他们就说好得很。
    章伯钧表示对演员很关心，并说我们演员是有群众的。今天想来，他说这话，一方面是给我们戴高帽子，另一方面是如果我们闹起事来，在群众中影响大，容易通过我们把群众拉到右派方面去。这也就使我们更加明白右派分子为什么要这么努力在戏曲界点火。
    他们开这样的会确实是有组织、有计划的。从6月13日开的第二次座谈会看来就更加明显了。在第一次座谈会时，主持会议的人提出下次请哪些人来参加的问题。他们最关心的是要找更多的“不满分子”来诉苦，来发表反对党的领导的言论。显然后来有人给他们提了名单，第二次我院又有些同志被邀参加了。这些新邀的大都是他们认为平常有些个人情绪的、对组织有些不满的人。
    这次会是在人民日报揭露右派活动的社论发表之后召开的。会一开始，李伯球针对人民日报的社论说：“外面有批评，也有反批评。有人说，这不是放是收了。有人不敢放了，把话放在肚子里，但是还有人敢继续放。问题在于少数人不能叫有多数人拥护的人下台。好比演员在台上演戏，多数人喜欢，不能因少数人叫他下台他就下台；但是多数人也不能把不同意见的少数人打出去。有人并没有叫下台，不过提出的意见尖锐些，如果把这种人也当做叫下台的人一样来批评那就不公平了。”他这些话的弦外之音在今天看来是很清楚了。他所指的批评，下台，多数人和少数人，究竟是指什么也很清楚了。
    在他的开场白说完之后，被邀来的人在他号召之下，纷纷发言。有人发言不符事实，但也有许多人对京剧院提一些正确的意见。照右派分子的布置来看，他们本来希望这一次比上一次热闹，多放些火，但是被邀来的人讲不出更多“坏事情”。李伯球大失所望，所以临了只得借口“天色不早”草草收场了。
    农工民主党一面在京剧界放火，一面利用时机大量发展党员，这是完全符合别有用心的发展几百万党员的计划的。居然有演员在他们诱惑之下情不可却地填了表。在6月12日提出申请，13日就被宣布批准入党（这位同志18日又声明要退党）。农工民主党还有一套手法，就是对一些有声望的演员，答应给予优待，入党以后可以做中央委员。原来他们为了达到自己的目的，是这样慷慨地拿政治送礼！
    我们的演员同志们，有些人在政治上是麻痹的，农工民主党里的右派分子，就抓住我们这一弱点，拉拢我们，充当他们的工具。我们有些演员同志们确实对剧院领导有意见，并且有好多意见是正确的，提出来也是必要的，但是应该实事求是，不应该乱说瞎话，更应该站稳立场，为了把京剧搞好而提出积极性的意见。立场不稳被右派分子一拉拢，一煽动，就乱动起来，那是很危险的。如果没有党及时领导展开反右派的斗争，有好些人还要大上右派分子的当呢。希望那些上了当的演员同志们，大胆起来揭发，他们是怎样被拉拢上当的。
