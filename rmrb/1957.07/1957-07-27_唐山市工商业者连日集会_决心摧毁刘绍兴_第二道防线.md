    Tangshan Industrialists and Businessmen Hold Gatherings for Days
    Determined to Destroy Liu Shaoxing's "Second Line of Defense"

    (Our dispatch) Tangshan City's vast numbers of industrialists and businessmen are currently engaged in an irreconcilable struggle against Liu Shaoxing, the right-wing element, deputy director of the Tangshan City Federation of Industry and Commerce, and private deputy director of the public-private joint venture Datong Rubber Factory.

    In early June, Liu Shaoxing participated in a forum for industrialists and businessmen convened by the United Front Work Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee in Baoding. He colluded with right-wing elements such as Gao Zhensheng to openly stir up trouble and spread poison at the meeting, saying, "There is not much difference between the thinking of workers and capitalists." He also slandered the public factory director, saying that he "treats private personnel as thieves." Upright industrialists and businessmen Cao Xuezhong and Tong Yongnian (who also attended the provincial meeting) refuted their fallacies. Those who agreed with Liu Shaoxing stepped forward to scold Tong Yongnian for being "shameless" and threatened to beat Cao Xuezhong, clamoring for great democracy. In order to expand their reactionary market, Liu Shaoxing and his cohorts personally helped individual industrialists and businessmen from Qinhuangdao, who came to the province to attend the meeting, draft anti-communist and anti-socialist speeches late at night, inciting backward elements to attack the Party.

    Liu Shaoxing has consistently held a hostile attitude towards socialist transformation. In 1954, when he saw that some larger private factories in Tangshan City had implemented public-private joint ownership, he attempted to ruin the Datong Rubber Factory. At that time, the boiler of the Datong Rubber Factory was in danger of exploding, and the workers submitted more than a dozen suggestions, requesting immediate repairs. However, Liu Shaoxing carelessly said: Let's just get through the day, make what we can. If it blows up, so be it. The longer it lasts, the more thousands of yuan I can pocket. Sure enough, the boiler exploded before long. At this time, Liu Shaoxing said: If the factory catches fire, I have nothing else to do but walk into the fire and coexist with the "position." Liu Shaoxing would rather destroy the factory than coexist with capitalism. After the enterprise was jointly operated, Liu Shaoxing used his position to undermine the prestige of the public representatives and alienate the relationship between the workers and the public representatives. In 1954, Zhang Xingwu, director of the East Mining District Federation of Industry and Commerce, actively promoted national construction bonds. Liu Shaoxing spread inflammatory remarks among industrialists and businessmen, saying that Zhang Xingwu had sold out the industrialists and businessmen of the East Mining District and given gifts; he also said, "The Communist Party cannot hold onto power and cannot build the country."

    For the past fifteen days, the city's vast numbers of industrialists and businessmen have continuously and severely criticized Liu Shaoxing's fallacies. Zhang Runtian vehemently criticized Liu Shaoxing, saying: "After liberation, the Communist Party rescued Liu Shaoxing from a life of eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, and shameless licentiousness, and also arranged a glorious position for him. But Liu Shaoxing actually used the Party's rectification as an opportunity to spread anti-socialist fallacies. Does he have any conscience? Liu Shaoxing's attempt to provoke the relationship between the Federation of Industry and Commerce and industrialists and businessmen, and to attack activists, is precisely to achieve the purpose of 'knocking down the Party's helpers,' so that backbone elements will break away from the Party and weaken the progressive forces, in order to do whatever he wants in the Federation of Industry and Commerce." Dong Ruisheng questioned Liu Shaoxing, saying: "Industrialists and businessmen with conscience all feel the warmth of the Party's policy of peaceful transformation; but you say that the public treats the private as thieves. What are your intentions? You must make a thorough account."

    Liu Shaoxing has admitted to collective reactionary activities, but refuses to confess the specific facts. He has indicated that he will retreat to the "second line of defense." The city's industrialists and businessmen are determined to fight Liu Shaoxing to the end.

    唐山市工商业者连日集会
    决心摧毁刘绍兴“第二道防线”
    本报讯　唐山市的广大工商业者，正在同右派分子唐山市工商联副主任、公私合营大同橡胶厂私方副厂长刘绍兴进行不调和的斗争。
    6月初，刘绍兴在保定参加省委统战部召开的工商界人士座谈会，和右派分子高振声等勾结起来，公开在会上兴风作浪，散布毒素，说“工人和资本家的思想已经没有多大区别。”他还诬蔑公方厂长“拿私方人员当贼看”。正直的工商业者曹学忠、佟永年（一同到省参加会的）驳斥了他们的谬论，和刘绍兴气味相投的人就出头谩骂佟永年“恬不知耻”，并要殴打曹学忠，叫嚷着要搞大民主。为了扩大他们的反动市场，和刘绍兴一伙的人在深夜里亲手帮助秦皇岛来省参加会的个别工商业者，起草反共反社会主义的发言稿，煽动落后分子向党进攻。
    刘绍兴对社会主义改造一贯抱着敌对态度。1954年他看到唐山市某些较大的私营工厂实行了公私合营，他就企图把大同橡胶厂搞垮。那时，大同橡胶厂的锅炉有发生爆炸的危险，职工提出十几份建议，要求马上修理。刘绍兴却满不在乎地说：混一天，少两半晌，炸碎了拉倒，多凑合一天，我多捞它一千元。果然时间不长锅炉就爆炸了。这时刘绍兴却说：如果厂子失了火，我没有别的，只有走进火里去，与“阵地”共存亡。刘绍兴就是宁愿把厂子毁掉，也要和资本主义共存亡的。企业合营后，刘绍兴利用他的职位，破坏公方代表威信，离间工人与公方代表的关系。1954年，东矿区工商联主任张星五积极推销国家建设公债，刘绍兴就在工商界中散布煽动性的言论，说张星五把东矿区工商业者出卖了，送了礼；还说什么“共产党守不住天下，建不了国”。
    近十五天来，全市广大工商业者连续对刘绍兴的谬论进行了严厉的批判。张润田痛斥刘绍兴说：“解放后，共产党把刘绍兴由吃喝嫖赌荒淫无耻的生活中拯救出来，还给安排了光荣的职务。但刘绍兴居然借党整风之机，散布反社会主义的谬论，还有一点良心吗？刘绍兴挑拨工商联和工商业者的关系，打击积极分子，正是要达到‘打掉党的助手’的目的，使骨干分子脱离党，削弱进步力量，以便在工商联里为所欲为。”董瑞生质问刘绍兴说：“有良心的工商业者，都感到党的和平改造政策的温暖；而你却说公方把私方当贼看，到底你居心何在？必须彻底交代。”
    刘绍兴已承认有集体反动活动，但不交代具体事实。他表示要退守“第二道防线”。全市工商业者，决心同刘绍兴斗争到底。
