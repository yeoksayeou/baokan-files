We fully agree with Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the various reports presented at the conference.

In the past few days, we have also studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" several times. We have learned a lot of useful things from this speech. The six political criteria proposed in the speech provide us with a yardstick for distinguishing right from wrong and friend from foe, and give us the most powerful ideological weapon to fight against bourgeois rightists.

We are members of the China Democratic League from Sichuan. Please allow us to report on how the rightists of the Democratic League are carrying out conspiracies in Sichuan. First, let us briefly talk about the Central Committee of the Democratic League.

Rightists Attempt to Use Intellectuals as Tools for Capitalist Restoration

From the materials that have been revealed, we know that the bourgeois rightists, headed by Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, are "middle-of-the-road" elements filled with bourgeois ideas and with historical roots in opposing the Communist Party's leadership of the revolution. Before liberation, in the stage of democratic revolution, the "middle-of-the-road" elements may have still had a bit of progressive air; after the national liberation, after the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was overthrown, if the "middle-of-the-road" elements remaining on the mainland have not repented, then it is only natural that this kind of people will sooner or later lean towards anti-Party and anti-socialism and be hostile to the people's democratic dictatorship.

Bourgeois rightists, to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism, must also prepare some capital. They can't get any "political capital" from the awakened workers and peasants. What to do? Their eyes turned to intellectuals, attempting and already scheming to use them. They saw that after the basic victory of the socialist revolution, the means of production were publicly owned. The only way to restore capitalism was to deceive the intellectuals who came from the old society and use their weaknesses in terms of their positions, viewpoints, and ways of thinking, which had not yet been transformed, to provoke and incite them as "political capital" for capitalist restoration. Rightists fundamentally do not think about how to help intellectuals actively carry out ideological transformation and continuously improve their ideological and political level. On the contrary, they drag them back, consciously negate the glorious achievements of New China, and one-sidedly exaggerate certain individual shortcomings of the Party's work towards intellectuals in the past. In this way, on the one hand, they provoke the relationship between the Party and the intellectuals, and on the other hand, in order to win over some intellectuals for their own use, they deliberately cater to the backward consciousness of intellectuals, saying things like "treating the virtuous with courtesy" and "visiting thatched cottages three times," self-appointing themselves as Zhuge Liang and comparing the people to Adou ("the blind masses"), cultivating the "lofty" thinking and "guest" mentality of intellectuals. In addition, right-wing "theoreticians" also say things like "the early spring weather of intellectuals" and so on, exuding an atmosphere of depression, sentimentality, and sorrow, as if for more than eight years after liberation, intellectuals have been living in severe cold without "thawing." Even nearly a year after the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" was proposed, the situation remained the same. Therefore, if the enthusiasm of intellectuals has not been brought into play, it seems that the intellectuals' position problem has been completely resolved, and there is no problem in terms of ideological consciousness, and there is no need to continue ideological transformation, and all responsibility lies with the Communist Party. In this way, "the contradiction between the small intellectuals of the working class and the big intellectuals of the petty bourgeoisie becomes the main contradiction of the present" (Luo Longji). The fallacies that the working-class party cannot lead intellectuals, cannot lead science and universities, etc. followed. It seems that the entire cultural and educational circles should be handed over to the Zhang-Luo Alliance to lead, and even the state power must be led jointly by all parties or by rotation. In this way, how could the Democratic League, whose leadership was usurped by the Zhang-Luo Alliance, not experience such a major problem of political dynamics turning to the right for a period of time? How could it not be used as a weapon to frantically attack the Party and socialism?

Sichuan is a large province. Just in terms of universities, there are more than twenty in Chengdu and Chongqing, with many intellectuals and many League members. At the same time, it is the "birthplace of the Democratic League." Therefore, the Zhang-Luo Alliance attaches great importance to Sichuan as a "base." Their conspiracy activities will certainly not relax in the remote Sichuan Province. Pan Dakui and others, who are named every day in newspapers in various parts of Sichuan, are the "generals" under Zhang and Luo and the backbone of the right-wing group. According to the materials that have been revealed, Pan Dakui has also done a lot of work of "calling the wind and rain and pushing the waves" in the anti-Party and anti-socialist political storm, and this work is echoing internally and externally and coordinating from top to bottom, and it has indeed achieved "organization, planning, program, and line," with common language, consistent practices, and exactly the same.

Right-wing ambitious people, such as Zhang and Luo, have been engaged in "political transactions" for decades and can be said to be "rich in political experience." Therefore, when they carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities, they will never convene any conferences or write out programs or plans and ask their subordinates to implement them. Their conspiracy is extremely secret, and the way of carrying it out is very flexible: individual connections, saying a little here, saying a little there, talking about some this time, and talking about some next time. The various aspects are combined before and after, and in reality, it becomes a complete set, that is: on the political line, it is anti-Party and anti-socialist, taking the capitalist road; on the organizational line, it is to combine the open and legal organizational form with the secret individual connections and the invisible organizational form, and a plan to "develop one million League members" has been drawn up, a large number of backward elements and even elements with hostile emotions towards the Party are absorbed, and gradually an "opposition party" that is opposed to the Party is formed. The action program during the rectification period is to use the name of "help" to light fires everywhere, provoke right and wrong, and attempt to increase the prestige of the League by weakening and attacking the Party's prestige, "let go" and develop a group of League members, and put forward the slogan of developing organizations on the so-called "front line." From the materials revealed in various places recently, isn't the intention of all this very clear?

The Conspiracy Activities of Sichuan Rightist Elements Pan Dakui and Others

Now, let us report on the situation of Sichuan rightist elements such as Pan Dakui, so that we can see one aspect of the conspiracy activities of the rightist elements (due to time constraints, many materials are not presented here).

First, Pan said: "Zhang Bojun has been engaged in politics for many years and is keenly aware," and believes that "Zhang's views are very insightful politically." He not only repeatedly promoted Zhang's proposal for a "two-chamber system" but also, after Zhang's fallacy of a "political design institute" was put forward, he also proposed that democratic parties should participate in the design, direction, and rehearsal work of major universities. Immediately afterwards, Pan's "general" Zhao Yiming proposed a "consultation plan" in Ya'an, echoing Zhang's "political design institute," etc., from top to bottom, exactly the same. The plot of the Zhang-Luo alliance, from the central government to the local level, has been carried out all the way to the grassroots.

Shu Jun, of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, said when conveying the spirit of the National Work Conference of the Democratic League in March this year: The Party has put forward the slogan of "political freedom, organizational independence, equal status, and managing their own affairs" for democratic parties. After checking, we learned that the last eight characters were "summarized" by Zhang Bojun. The anti-Party thinking of the Zhang-Luo Alliance of setting up separate courts has been carried out from the central government to the local level, forming Pan Dakui's instruction to Zhao Yiming: "Get rid of the Party's leadership, emphasize the independence and freedom of democratic parties, and be on an equal footing, not in the socialist direction."

This spring, Luo Longji, in his capacity as a people's representative, vice chairman of the Democratic League, and minister of the Ministry of Forestry Industry, came to Sichuan to "inspect" his work. He saw the trees but not the forest. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China asked Luo to offer his opinions. He did not specifically raise problems in person but secretly took back a large number of so-called "accusations" and "reports" that clamored for "deviations" in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, as the basis for proposing a "rehabilitation committee." Pan openly supported Luo's proposal in Sichuan and further proposed that "rehabilitation" should also include the "three-anti" and "five-anti" campaigns.

When Luo Longji came to Chengdu this year, when Fan Puzhai invited Luo to dinner, Luo affirmed in his conversation that Hu Feng was wrong, and Fan also echoed that Hu Feng may not be a counter-revolutionary. Pan also said: "Whether Hu Feng is a counter-revolutionary, in my opinion, is still a problem." This is obviously breathing through the same nostril as Zhang Bojun, who believes that Hu Feng is a "historical figure," echoing each other from top to bottom.

Secondly, Pan's views on intellectuals and his actions in provoking the relationship between the Party and intellectuals can be said to be a Sichuan version of Zhang and Luo's methods. Pan firmly supported Luo Longji's wrong opinions on the intellectual question, opposed the correct opinions of Comrade Hu Yuzhi, which were supported by the majority, and pointed out that the sentence "a relatively large number of comrades agree with Comrade Hu Yuzhi's opinions" should be deleted from the report. At a symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee, Pan, borrowing the opinions of others, slandered "the Party treats intellectuals as worse than dog shit, not even as good as being in prison, where there is still humane treatment."

In addition, when Pan conveyed the spirit of the Central Work Conference of the Democratic League among League members in Chengdu universities, he used the example of Sun Dayu, a League member from Fudan University, who insulted the Party's responsible comrades as counter-revolutionaries, to encourage everyone to speak out and let go, and he also said: "This is a way of speaking out and letting go." In this way, he used "speaking out" and "letting go" to "help" the rectification and attack the Party, causing a lot of trouble in Chengdu universities. In particular, Zhao Yiming's "lighting fire" at Sichuan Agricultural College in Ya'an was even more prominent. Due to Zhao's "work," a part of the teachers and students of the college made a big fuss about moving back to Chengdu, the school order was chaotic, and it was difficult to carry out the rectification movement.

In Chongqing, Shu Jun, of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, put forward ten instructions in his report, including, "...(2) League organizations and League members should speak out righteously against dogmatism and authority and break superstitions;...(4) League organizations should do the work of removing hats; (5) League organizations should do the work of relieving the siege; (6) League organizations should do political insurance work..." Who exactly does Shu Jun want to "remove the hat" for? Who is he relieving the siege for? And who is he providing political insurance for? Is this to guide League members onto the road of socialism, or is it to use them as stepping stones for a few ambitious people? Let's see how Shu Jun, Li Kang, and others "speak out righteously."

Originally, the Party's rectification was planned and step-by-step. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China had decided to postpone the work in primary schools, but Shu Jun, Li Kang, and others repeatedly asked Comrade Liu Lanqi, who worked in primary schools, to go to the United Front Work Department to "pour out her grievances" and had already registered for her, insisting that she "pour out" her grievances.

Comrade Jin Xiru, the dean of Chongqing University (a League member), was forced to say that he "has a position but no power." He also said: "Others say they have a position but no power, why do you say you have a position and power?!" In mid-May, when Peng Dixian passed through Chongqing on his way back to Chengdu, Shu Jun encouraged Peng to say: "This time, Chairman Pan Dakui spoke out very well in Chengdu, I hope you will also speak out and let go when you go back!" Fortunately, Peng Dixian was not fooled. May I ask, what is this if not provoking right and wrong and lighting fires everywhere? Why do they want to do this?

Comrade Li Linzheng, a League member in Chongqing, said: The work of Shu and Li has always been passive, but after the National Work Conference of the Democratic League, they became active. Compared with before, they are like two different people, which shows that they have accepted the views of rightists such as Zhang and Luo and admire their remarks wholeheartedly. What kind of tricks did the Zhang-Luo alliance play at the work conference of the Democratic League? The eyes of the masses are sharp, and it can no longer be concealed.

Even more absurd is that Han Wenqi (Standing Committee Member of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Democratic League), a rightist element in Sichuan, in his lengthy written speech "helping" the Party's rectification, was full of hostility towards the Party from beginning to end. Han believes that: (1) The suppression of counter-revolutionaries is "bold suspicion" and a mess; (2) The Party has taken care of everything – the fallacy of "the Party's world"; (3) "Achievements are the main and shortcomings are secondary" is a cliché; (4) "The majority of Party members are ignorant and ignorant," and judging good people from bad people also requires a certain "cultural foundation." In short, this is tantamount to saying that the working-class party cannot lead the revolution, cannot do a good job in construction, please "step down." What is this?!

Are such serious wrong fallacies and actions individual, accidental coincidences? Absolutely not!

Luo Longji Has Been Running a Right-Wing Group in the League for Many Years

As early as May 1948, after the Third Plenary Session of the Democratic League resolved to abandon the middle road, Zhang Bojun secretly ordered Zhang Songtao, a League member in Sichuan, to bring back a cloth strip from Hong Kong, "instructing" the Sichuan League organization, the content of which was to advocate taking the middle road and establish "bases" in Sichuan. At that time, Pan Dakui, Fan Puzhai, and others were responsible for the Sichuan League organization.

Luo Longji has been running a right-wing small group in the League for more than ten years. This small group includes Zhang Dongsun, Zeng Zhaolun, Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Fan Puzhai, Zhang Zhihe, Ye Duyi, Pan Dakui, Liu Wangliming, Zhou Jingwen, and others. They have always adopted the method of "uniting the backward, winning over the middle, and attacking the progressive," slandering progressive elements and saying that they are "not the Party's helpers but thugs." They don't like League members leading other League members forward and insist on League members withdrawing from the League. At the same time, they also take an opposing attitude towards League members striving to join the Party. Why are there these situations? The reason is very simple, because if everyone progresses, they will have no market to spread fallacies, and their "political capital" will be gone.

In 1950, Luo gathered Zhang Songtao and two other people in Beijing to plan how to return to Sichuan to seize the local organization of the League. In 1951, Luo sent a special letter to Fan Puzhai, asking him to go to Chongqing to assist Pan. The letter also said: "I have no other strengths in my life, but I only know how to fight to the end." The purpose of these people's struggle is obvious today. That is, anti-Party and anti-socialism. This spring, Fan Puzhai also went to the United Front Work Department of Sichuan Province to reflect that we did not cooperate with Pan, so Pan could not achieve anything. After the Zhang Dongsun incident in 1953, Luo's small group did not dare to engage in public activities anymore, and changed to the way of "meeting friends through literature" and "individual connections" to contact each other. Luo sat in the central government to command, and the "generals" in various places responded one after another. Is this accidental?

    揭露章罗联盟在四川的阴谋
    彭迪先、曾庶凡、刘承钊、刘兰畦的发言
    我们完全同意周总理的“政府工作报告”和大会上的各项报告。
    在这几天，我们又学习了几次毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话。我们从这篇讲话里学得了不少有益的东西。讲话中提出的六项政治标准，给我们以明辨是非、分清敌我的准绳，使我们掌握了和资产阶级右派分子进行斗争的最有力的思想武器。
    我们是来自四川的中国民主同盟的盟员。请大会允许我们汇报一下民盟右派分子在四川如何进行阴谋活动的。首先请让我们简单地从民盟中央谈起。
    右派企图利用知识分子做资本主义复辟的工具
    从已经揭露的材料看来，我们知道，以章伯钧、罗隆基为首的资产阶级右派分子，是在头脑中充满着资产阶级思想的、具有历史根源的反对共产党领导革命的“中间路线”分子。解放前，在民主革命阶段，“中间路线”分子可能还有一点进步的气息；到了全国解放，国民党反动统治被推翻之后，残留在大陆上的“中间路线”分子，如果还没有翻然悔悟，那末，这一类人迟早会一边倒向反党反社会主义，敌视人民民主专政，这可说是很自然的事情。
    资产阶级右派分子，要反对共产党，要反对社会主义，也得准备一点本钱。他们在翻身觉悟了的工农群众中是根本捞不着什么“政治资本”的。怎么办？他们的眼睛就转向知识分子，企图而且已经在知识分子身上打主意。他们眼看社会主义革命基本胜利后，生产资料公有了，只有蒙蔽从旧社会来的知识分子，并利用他们在立场观点和思想作风方面还未获得改造的一些弱点，把他们挑拨和煽动起来作为使资本主义复辟的“政治资本”。右派分子根本不去想如何帮助知识分子积极进行思想改造，不断提高思想政治水平，相反地，却拉他们的后腿，有意识地否定新中国的辉煌成就，片面夸大过去党在对待知识分子工作中的某些个别缺点。这样，一方面挑拨党与知识分子的关系，一方面为了拉拢一些知识分子供他们利用，故意迎合知识分子的落后意识，说什么“礼贤下士”“三顾茅庐”等等，自封为诸葛亮，把人民比作阿斗（“群盲”），培养知识分子的“清高”思想和“作客”情绪。此外，右派“理论家”，还说什么“知识分子的早春天气”如何如何，散发出一种抑郁、感伤和哀怨的气氛，好像解放后八年多来，知识分子一直都过着严寒生活，没有“解冻”。甚至在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针提出后将近一年，情况依然如故。因此，知识分子的积极性如果还没有发挥出来，似乎知识分子的立场问题已经完全解决了，在思想意识方面也没有什么问题，用不着继续进行思想改造了，一切责任都在共产党方面。这样“工人阶级的小知识分子和小资产阶级的大知识分子之间的矛盾，就形成为当前的主要矛盾”（罗隆基）。工人阶级的政党不能领导知识分子，不能领导科学和高等学校等等谬论就跟着出现了。似乎整个文教界都应该交给章罗联盟领导，甚至国家政权也必须各党派共同领导或轮流执政。这样，被章罗联盟篡夺了领导权的民盟，怎样不在一段时期内发生政治动态向右转的这样重大问题呢？怎样不被用来作为向党向社会主义猖狂进攻的武器呢？
    四川是一个大省，只就高等学校来说，成渝两地就有二十几所，有不少知识分子，有不少盟员，同时又是“民盟发祥地”，因此，章罗联盟对四川这个“据点”是极其重视的。他们的阴谋活动当然不会放松边远的四川省。四川各地报纸上天天点名的潘大逵等，就是章罗手下的“大将”、右派集团中的骨干分子。根据已经揭发的材料看来，在反党反社会主义的政治风浪中，潘大逵也作了不少“呼风唤雨，推涛作浪”的工作，而且这些工作是内外呼应、上下配合的，确实做到了“有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线”，语言共同，作法一致，一模一样。
    右派野心家，如章罗之流，是搞了几十年“政治交易”的，可说是“富有政治经验”。因此，在他们进行反党反社会主义阴谋活动时，绝不会召开什么大会，写出纲领、计划之类叫他们下面的人去执行。他们的阴谋是极其隐秘的，进行的方式是很灵活的，个别串连，东说一点，西说一点，这次谈一些，那次又谈一些，前后各方面合起来实际就成了一套，那就是：在政治路线上是反党反社会主义，走资本主义的道路；在组织路线上是将公开合法的组织形式同秘密个别串连的无形的组织形式结合起来，订出了“发展盟员一百万”的计划，大量吸收落后的甚至对党有敌对情绪的分子，逐渐形成为一个与党闹对立的“反对党”。在整风期间的行动纲领，就是以“帮助”为名，到处点火，挑拨是非，并企图从削弱和打击党的威信中来提高盟的威信，“放手”发展一批盟员，提出了所谓“火线”上发展组织的口号。所有这些，从最近各地揭露的材料看来，其用意还不很明白吗？
    四川右派分子潘大逵等的阴谋活动
    现在，让我们汇报一下四川右派分子潘大逵等的情况，就可见右派分子阴谋活动之一斑（因限于时间，很多材料不在此提出）。
    首先，潘说：“章伯钧是搞了多年政治的，感觉锐敏”，并认为“章的主张很有政治见解”，不但一再宣扬章的“上下两院制”的主张，并在章的“政治设计院”的谬论提出后，他也提出民主党派应当参加各大专学校领导的设计、导演、排演的工作。紧接着，潘的“大将”赵一明，就在雅安提出什么“协商方案”，与章的“政治设计院”等上下呼应，如出一辙。章罗联盟的企图，就这样由中央到地方，一直搞到基层。
    民盟重庆市委舒军，在传达今年三月民盟全国工作会议时曾说：党提出了民主党派“政治自由、组织独立，地位平等、自己当家”的口号。经过查对，才知道后面八个字是章伯钧“归纳”出来的。章罗联盟的分庭抗礼的反党思想，由中央贯穿到地方，形成为潘大逵对赵一明的指示：“脱离党的领导，强调民主党派独立自由，平起平坐，不要社会主义方向。”
    今春，罗隆基以人民代表、民盟副主席、森林工业部部长的身份到四川“视察”工作。他见树不见林。中共四川省委曾请罗提意见，他当面不具体提出问题，却秘密的带回一大批叫嚣肃反有“偏差”的所谓“控告”“检举”信件，作为提出“平反委员会”的根据。潘在四川公开支持罗的主张，并进一步提出“平反”还要包括“三反”“五反”在内。
    今年罗隆基来成都时，在范朴斋请罗吃饭的时候，罗在言谈中肯定胡风是搞错了，范也附和说胡风可能不是反革命。潘也说过：“胡风是不是反革命，据我看来还是一个问题。”这跟章伯钧认为胡风是“历史人物”，显然是一鼻孔出气，上下呼应的。
    其次，潘对知识分子的看法以及在挑拨党和知识分子的关系等方面，可以说是章罗手法在四川的翻版。潘坚决支持罗隆基对知识分子问题的错误意见，反对大多数人赞成的胡愈之同志的正确意见，并指出要把“比较多数的同志同意胡愈之同志的意见”一句从报告中删去。潘在四川省委统战部召开的座谈会上，借反映别人意见诬蔑“党把知识分子当狗屎都不如，还不如坐监狱，监狱还有人道待遇”。
    此外，潘在成都高等学校盟员中传达民盟中央工作会议精神时，以复旦大学一个盟员孙大雨辱骂党的负责同志是反革命作为例子来鼓励大家鸣、放，他还说：“这是一种鸣、放的方式。”这样他就利用“鸣”“放”，“帮助”整风，向党进攻，乱鸣乱放，在成都的高等学校中引起了不少乱子。特别是赵一明在雅安四川农学院“点火”更为突出。由于赵的“工作”，该院一部分师生大闹要迁回成都，学校秩序混乱，影响整风运动难于开展。
    在重庆，民盟市委舒军在作传达报告时，提出了十点指示，其中，“……（二）对教条主义、权威，盟组织和盟员要仗义执言，打破迷信；……（四）盟组织要做摘帽子的工作；（五）盟组织要做解围工作；（六）盟组织要做政治保险工作……”。舒军究竟要为谁“摘帽子”？为谁解围？又为谁作政治保险呢？这是想把盟员引导上社会主义的道路，还是想把他们当作少数野心家的垫脚石呢？我们且看舒军、李康等是怎样“仗义执言”的。
    本来，党的整风是有计划有步骤的。中共重庆市委已决定小学方面稍缓再搞，而舒军、李康等都一再叫在小学工作的刘兰畦同志到统战部去“吐苦水”，并已代为报名，非去“吐”不可。
    重庆大学教务长金锡如同志（盟员），曾被迫叫他一定要说“有职无权”。还说：“别人都说有职无权，为什么你要说有职有权？！”五月中旬，彭迪先路过重庆回成都，舒军鼓动彭说：“这次潘大逵主委在成都鸣、放得很好，希望你回去也大鸣大放！”好在彭迪先还没有上当。试问，这不是挑拨是非，到处点火是什么？他们为什么要这样搞？
    重庆盟员李麟征同志说：舒、李二人的工作一向是消沉的，但在民盟全国工作会议以后便活跃起来了，前后相比，判若两人，可见他们是接受了章罗等右派的主张的，对他们的言论是钦佩得五体投地的。章罗联盟在民盟工作会议时搞了一些什么鬼，群众的眼睛是雪亮的，再也隐瞒不过了。
    还有更荒唐的是：四川的右派分子韩文畦（民盟四川省委会常务委员）在他“帮助”党整风所提出的冗长的书面发言中，从头到尾充满着对党的敌对情绪。韩认为：（一）肃反是“大胆怀疑”，一团糟；（二）党包办了一切——“党天下”的谬论；（三）“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的”是陈词滥调；（四）“大多数党员愚昧无知”，而判断好人坏人，还要有一定的“文化基础”。总而言之，这等于说工人阶级的政党不能领导革命，搞不好建设，请“下台”吧。这是什么话？！
    像这样一些严重错误的谬论和行动是个别的、偶然巧合的吗？绝对不是！
    罗隆基在盟内搞右派集团已有多年历史
    早在一九四八年五月，民盟三中全会已决议放弃中间路线之后，章伯钧还秘密地令四川盟员张松涛从香港带回布条，“指示”四川盟组织，内容是鼓吹走中间路线，在四川搞“据点”。当时，潘大逵、范朴斋等就是四川盟组织的负责人。
    罗隆基在盟内搞右派小集团，已有十年以上历史，这个小集团包括张东荪、曾昭抡、潘光旦、费孝通、吴景超、范朴斋、张志和、叶笃义、潘大逵、刘王立明、周鲸文等人。他们一贯地采取“团结落后，争取中间，打击进步”的办法，诬蔑进步分子，说他们“不是党的助手，而是打手”。他们不喜欢盟内党员带动其他盟员前进，硬要盟内党员退盟。同时他们对盟员争取入党也是采取反对的态度。为什么有这种种情况呢？道理很简单，因为如果大家都进步了，他们就没有散布谬论的市场了，“政治资本”也没有了。
    一九五○年，罗约集张松涛等三人，在京策划如何回川夺取盟的地方组织，一九五一年罗专函范朴斋，叫他到重庆助潘一臂之力。信中又说：“弟一生别无他长，唯知斗争到底而已。”这些人的斗争目的，在今天是显而易见的。那就是反党反社会主义。今春范朴斋还专门到四川省统战部反映我们不与潘合作，使潘不能有所作为。一九五三年张东荪事件后，罗的小集团不敢再公开活动了，改用“以文会友”、“个别串连”的方式来联系，罗坐在中央指挥，各地“大将”就纷纷响应，这是偶然的吗？章罗联盟，利令智昏，错误地估计了目前的形势，妄想在中国制造匈牙利事件，混水摸鱼，这是我们能容忍的吗？
    不错，四川是一个大省，有不少知识分子，有不少盟员，又是民盟的“发祥地”，因此，右派分子始终想在四川搞一个很坚实的“据点”。他们一直进行着各种各样的阴谋活动。四川盟内的斗争是一直没有中断过的。
    解放初期，四川民盟整理组织，清洗了一批不够盟员条件的盟员出盟，这就引起右派分子始终怀恨在心。去年以来，他们又决定“大发展”的方针，而四川民盟又没有大力加以贯彻，他们也是很不满意的。（一九五六年民盟在全国约发展盟员百分之三十左右，四川只有百分之十几，其中成都更少。）因此，潘等大声疾呼要“川流不息的发展”，要在“大鸣大放”的“火线”上发展，强调“发展就是工作”，要大力发展中间和落后的。这种无原则的大发展，显然是要为右派野心家积聚“政治资本”。这不仅会削弱民盟在革命队伍中的战斗力量，而且还会发展到“与党平分秋色”和与党分庭抗礼。作为党领导下的一个民主党派，民盟应不应该这样搞呢？显然这是违反盟章的、错误的。
    章罗联盟，一方面要以潘为其联盟中的一个重要环节，但同时又经常感到这一环节不够坚实，因此，一有机会就有人要到四川“视察”，“助一臂之力”。在最近几个月，罗隆基、费孝通、马哲民、范朴斋、刘王立明等都到四川去过。这样，在四川的天空上怎么不黑云乱翻呢？
    盟员要在自我改造方面痛下功夫
    在这次章罗联盟所掀起的政治大风浪中，有的人是立场不够稳的，有的人甚至是曾经被他们蒙蔽利用过，他们的谬论可能有过一些市场。最近，经过各方面的揭露，章罗联盟的阴谋已被粉碎了，他们的丑恶面目我们也已经看清楚了。我们热烈希望一些立场不稳的，误入歧途，被他们利用过的人，赶快翻然悔悟，站稳人民的立场，跟章罗右派野心家在思想上割断联系，在政治上划清界限，参加到反右派的斗争行列中来。人民群众是很欢迎他们这样做的。就是章罗二人，我们也希望他们及早向人民悔过，老老实实地交代一切，接受改造，不要自绝于人民。
    为了吸取这次章罗联盟事件的严重教训，我们知识分子特别是盟员同志，要在自我教育和自我改造方面痛下功夫，随时警惕着要站稳立场，要防止右派分子来钻我们的空子，要清除我们从旧社会带来的坏思想和坏习惯，以适应新社会的需要。我们要经常记着毛主席的指示，我们如果离开社会主义事业，离开共产党所领导的劳动人民，就会无所依靠，是不能有任何光明的前途的（“讲话”第二八页）。因此，跟着党走社会主义的道路，是我们知识分子唯一的光荣的平安大道，这是不容任何怀疑和动摇的。
    作为中国民主同盟的盟员，我们特别对自己的组织提出热烈的期待。我们要求民盟通过反右派斗争和整风学习，肃清右派的思想影响，在党的领导下，更健康的帮助知识分子进行自我改造，协助动员知识分子发挥智慧，发挥才能，反映知识分子的正当利益和要求，贯彻执行党对知识分子的政策，把知识分子更紧密地团结在党的周围。在目前情况下，在思想上首先必须进一步明确：民主党派要能够做到“长期共存、互相监督”，就必须建立在拥护共产党、走社会主义道路的共同基础上。民盟如果没有党的领导，在解放前的几次政治大风浪中即早已被毁灭了。党的领导，是我们工作的出发点和搞好工作的保证。其次，除了明确政治方向之外，我们还要根据毛主席“讲话”中所提出的六个标准来判明是非、划清敌我，不容有任何含混。因此，我们坚决反对右派野心家利用盟的合法组织的形式来掩盖一切反党反社会主义的阴谋活动。我们绝对不作“马路政客”的政治资本。我们绝对不作“小资产阶级大知识分子妄想篡夺无产阶级领导权的垫脚石。我们要同右派分子斗争到底。为了纯洁民盟的组织，加强民盟在革命队伍中的战斗力，我们完全拥护民盟暂时停止发展组织、进行整风。经过整风，解决盟内的许多错误思想，提高思想认识。今后民盟的组织和发展的方针，一定要建立在接受共产党领导和拥护走社会主义道路的进步知识分子的基础上。根据同样的原则，我们主张民盟的各级领导必须加以改进，并使其能掌握在真正接受党的领导和坚决走社会主义道路的成员的手中，领导和团结全国盟员和联系的群众跟着共产党走，并真心诚意的为社会主义事业服务。我们要坚决防止民盟的各级领导机构被右派分子所盘踞作为反党反社会主义的阵地。我们认为，我们的主张不仅是符合于民盟的利益，同时也是符合于全国人民的利益和愿望的。
    民盟这次虽然出现了章伯钧、罗隆基这一小撮右派野心家，但仍然不能否定民盟在知识界所起的一些好的作用。我们相信民盟是经得起考验的。我们相信党的领导，也相信大多数盟员知识分子的政治觉悟，因此有理由相信在党的领导和群众的监督下，还会遵循社会主义的道路继续前进，不至于辜负“长期共存、互相监督”，“一切为了社会主义”的使命。
    我们已经投入这次政治上和思想上的反右派斗争。我们决心通过这次斗争的锻炼和盟内整风的学习，提高思想政治水平，在党的领导下，更好地为社会主义建设服务。
    以上发言，请各位代表指正。
