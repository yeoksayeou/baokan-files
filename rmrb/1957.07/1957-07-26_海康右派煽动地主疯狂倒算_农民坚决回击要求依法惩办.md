Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 25th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Liang Fuqing, Chen Rijing report): In Haikang County, Guangdong Province, some landlord elements, incited and supported by Wu Lin, deputy county magistrate of Haikang County and head of the Haikang County branch of the China Democratic League, have recently been frantically seeking to settle scores with the peasants. Seventy-nine landlord households have already declared that they will reclaim the houses confiscated during the land reform from the peasants, and some landlords have even brazenly forced their way into the homes of peasants to live.

In June of this year, Wu Lin, under the guise of "inspection," went to Nantian Township in Haikang County to collude with landlords and controlled elements everywhere, seeking to settle accounts with the peasants. Wu Lin everywhere clamored for the landlords, saying, "These people are so old and their lives are so hard. Isn't the government taking care of the 'Five Guarantees' households? Why not return their houses to them?" In the county town, Wu Lin even went to the offices of grassroots cadres and coerced them into returning the orchard of landlord Tang Quan's mother. Lin Zeyiing, a teacher at Haikang County No. 1 Middle School and a landlord element, also received Wu Lin's support in demanding that peasants return their houses. Wu Lin repeatedly asked the County People's Committee and the Secretary of the CCP Town Committee to handle the matter according to the absurd demands of the landlord elements. Under Wu Lin's incitement and support, the local landlord elements responded with a hundred calls. Seventy-nine households have already declared that they will reclaim the confiscated houses. Among them, Zhou Bingyuan, a former backbone element of the Kuomintang, even brazenly forced his way back into his original house. Some landlord elements in the county town even wantonly threatened the peasants, saying, "You must move out immediately, otherwise you will have to pay rent later." Some landlords even threatened the cadres, saying, "You confiscated my house without a written agreement, this won't do!" The landlord Lin Wenchao even wrote a letter to his so-called "most beloved person" Wu Lin, saying, "We are in the same situation and will share the same fate."

As early as May of this year, Wu Lin proposed an absurd proposal for the so-called "request to return houses" at a meeting of the Guangdong Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference. In addition to denying his own landlord status, he also unreasonably demanded that the house be returned to him for his own residence. After Wu Lin returned to Haikang County, he continuously made absurd demands to Deputy County Magistrate Zeng Decai, demanding that the houses confiscated during the land reform be returned to him immediately. He also threatened Lin Hua, director of the County People's Committee Office, several times, asking him to inform the Secretary of the CCP County Committee to implement his will. Later, Wu Lin's brother's wife went to the Shentang District Government to demand the return of the house and threatened the peasants who had received materials from Wu Lin's house during the land reform, saying, "How many of the clothes you got from my family are left? Are they worn out?"

Is Wu Lin a landlord? The peasants in his hometown gave him an account: The Wu family had nine people, with three laborers, none of whom participated in labor. Before the land reform, his family had 16.8 mu of land, all relying on hired short-term laborers to cultivate, exploiting these short-term laborers for 600 labor days a year. The family also had a long-term worker and a maidservant. All the land in Beijia, Xitou, and other villages was rented out, collecting more than 40 shi of rent grain each year. Wu Lin also forcibly occupied 40 mu of public land in Beitan Village, assigning it to his henchman Wu Fuhai to manage and hiring short-term laborers to cultivate it. Wu Lin also consistently engaged in usury. According to calculations at the time of the land reform, the high-interest loans he extended were equivalent to 1,500 silver dollars.

In addition, according to revelations from local peasants, Wu Lin also successively held reactionary positions before liberation as "Special Commissioner for Party Purification" in Suixi County of the Kuomintang, "Secretary of the Haikang County Party Headquarters," "Executive Committee Member of the Suixi County Party Headquarters," clerk of the pseudo "Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau," "Telegraph Inspector of the Guangzhou News Office Inspection Office," "Councilor of the South Road Guerrilla Headquarters," and "Instructor of the Suixi County Cadre Training Institute."

During the land reform, the local peasants legally confiscated and distributed Wu Lin's two large tile houses and Western-style buildings. In order to maintain the interests of the landlord class, Wu Lin expressed extreme dissatisfaction and hatred towards the Party and the peasant masses. Therefore, he took the opportunity of the great "blooming and contending" to incite the landlords everywhere to seek to settle accounts with the peasants.

Wu Lin's crimes aroused the righteous indignation of the peasants throughout Haikang County. They all demanded to settle the accounts of exploitation with Wu Lin. At the beginning of this month, the peasants in the county town held a rally to struggle against Zhou Bingyuan, the landlord element who forcibly seized the peasants' houses, and demanded that the government punish Wu Lin and all the landlords who sought to settle accounts with the peasants according to the law. The responsible persons of the Party and government organs of Haikang County attended the meeting and expressed their support for the just actions of the peasants.

    海康右派煽动地主疯狂倒算  农民坚决回击要求依法惩办
    新华社广州25日电　新华社记者梁福擎、陈日晶报道：广东省海康县的一些地主分子在海康县副县长、民盟海康县负责人吴林的煽动和支持下，最近正在疯狂地向农民进行倒算，已经有七十九户地主声言要向农民夺回土地改革时被没收的房屋，有些地主竟公然强行搬进农民的家里居住。
    今年6月，吴林借“视察”名义到海康县南田乡到处串连地主和被管制分子向农民进行倒算。吴林到处为地主叫嚣说：“这些人年纪那么大，生活又苦，政府不是照顾五保户吗？为什么就不给他们发还房屋？”在县城镇，吴林竟跑到基层干部的办公室胁逼干部退回地主唐权母的果园。海康县第一中学教师、地主分子林则英要求农民倒退房子，也得到吴林的支持，吴林曾数次要求县人民委员会和中共镇委书记按照地主分子的荒谬要求处理。在吴林的煽动和支持下，当地的地主分子一呼百应，已经有七十九户声言要夺回已被没收的房屋。其中前国民党的骨干分子周炳元甚至公然强行搬入原屋居住。县城镇有的地主分子还肆意恐吓农民说：“你们要马上迁走，否则以后就要同你们算租钱。”有的地主甚至向干部威胁说：“你没有立字据就没收了我的屋，不成！”地主林文超还写了一封信给他的所谓“最心爱的人”吴林说：“我们处境相同，祸福同当。”
    早在今年5月，吴林在广东省政协的一次会议上提出了一项所谓“请发还房屋”的荒谬提案。他除了否认他自己的地主成分外，还无理要求将房屋交还他本人居住。吴林回到海康县以后，就不断向副县长曾德才提出荒谬要求，要马上将他在土地改革时被没收的房屋交还给他，又几次气势汹汹地要挟县人民委员会办公室主任林华，要他转告中共县委书记，按照他的意旨执行。以后，吴林的弟妇就到沈塘区政府索还房屋，并向在土地改革时分得吴林家中物资的农民恐吓说：“你们分得我家的衣服还剩多少？穿破了没有？”
    吴林是不是地主呢？他的家乡的农民给他算了一笔账：吴家九口，有三个劳动力，全不参加劳动。土地改革前他家有十六点八亩田，全靠雇短工耕种，一年里就剥削这些短工六百个劳动日；家里还有一名长工和婢女。他家在北家、溪头等村的土地都全部出租，每年收租谷四十石以上。吴林还强占了北谭村的四十亩公田，给他的狗腿子吴福海管理，并雇短工耕种。吴林还一贯放高利贷，根据土地改革时的计算，他放出的高利贷款折合银元有一千五百元。
    此外，根据当地农民揭露，吴林在解放前还历任国民党遂溪县“清党特派员”、“海康县党部秘书”、“遂溪县党部执行委员”、伪“广州市公安局科员”、“广州新闻处检查所电讯检查员”、“南路游击司令部参议”、“遂溪县干训所教官”等反动职务。
    土地改革时，当地农民曾依法将吴林的大瓦房和大洋楼各一座没收分配。吴林为了保持地主阶级的利益，对党和农民群众表示极端的不满和仇恨。因此，这次乘大“鸣”大“放”的机会到处煽动地主向农民进行倒算。
    吴林的罪行激起了海康县全县农民的义愤，他们都纷纷要求和吴林算剥削账。本月初，县城镇农民曾开大会斗争强夺农民房屋的地主分子周炳元，并要求政府依法惩办吴林和一切向农民倒算的地主。海康县党、政机关的负责人都出席了大会，对农民的正义行动表示支持。
