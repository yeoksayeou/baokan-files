Xinhua News Agency, July 24th, New York: American reporter Arnold Beichman, after conducting an on-the-ground interview with the Algerian National Liberation Army, praised it as an army that is "disciplined, has manpower, has weapons, has command, and has fighting spirit," and certainly not the "rabble" that the French colonialists call it. Beichman's interview report was published in the latest issue of "Newsweek."

Beichman lived with officers and soldiers of the National Liberation Army for three days and three nights in the secret headquarters of the National Liberation Army. He described the soldiers as young and strong, capable of marching approximately fifty miles through rugged terrain with light weapons and ammunition between dusk and dawn. He also said that the National Liberation Army has stockpiled munitions, food, and medicine in various war zones according to strategic principles, and can supply the troops' needs at any time.

    阿尔及利亚民族解放军是有纪律有斗志的军队
    美国记者说实话
    新华社24日讯  纽约消息：美国记者阿诺德·贝奇曼在对阿尔及利亚民族解放军进行实地采访之后，赞扬它是一支“有纪律、有人力、有武器、有指挥、有斗志”的军队，而绝不是像法国殖民者所说的“乌合之众”。贝奇曼的这篇采访报道发表在最近一期的“新闻周刊”上。
    贝奇曼曾经在阿尔及利亚民族解放军的秘密指挥部里同民族解放军官兵共同生活了三天三夜。他形容那些士兵是年轻力壮的，他们能带着轻型武器和弹药在黄昏之后和黎明之前穿越崎岖地带行军五十英里左右。他还说，民族解放军在战区各地都根据战略原则贮藏有军火、粮食和医药，可以随时供应部队的需要。
