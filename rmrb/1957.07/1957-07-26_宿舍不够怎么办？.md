    At the recently concluded National People's Congress meeting, some people's representatives made suggestions on solving the problem of employee housing and preventing the influx of rural population into cities. This is a significant and timely suggestion.

    Not long ago, I visited cities such as Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Wuhan. In these cities, I saw rows upon rows of employee dormitories, some resembling worker cities and others worker villages. Yet, in these very places, I heard everywhere that there weren't enough dormitories and that the housing situation was very tight. Is it really the case that too few employee dormitories have been built? According to recent survey materials from the State Planning Commission and the State Construction Commission, employee dormitories have not been built too little; on the contrary, too many have been built. It would be beyond the country's financial and material capacity to build a large number more.

    The First Five-Year Plan stipulated that the construction area for employee dormitories should be approximately 46 million square meters, which was appropriate compared to the production development figures stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. However, in the first four years of implementing the Five-Year Plan, 65.15 million square meters were built, exceeding the Five-Year Plan by more than 41%. If we add the dormitories that have already been approved for construction this year, the number is even more prominent. The rate of increase in employee dormitories has far exceeded the rate of production development in our country. According to preliminary calculations by the State Planning Commission, although the total output value of industry, handicrafts, agriculture, and sideline occupations in our country reached the 1957 targets stipulated in the Five-Year Plan in 1956, it only exceeded them by a little more than 2%.

    These dormitories, calculated according to the quota set when the Five-Year Plan was compiled (60% of employees with dependents, with an average of 20 square meters of dormitory construction area per employee), could accommodate more than 3.2 million employees. The Five-Year Plan stipulated that the number of employees would only increase by 4.22 million. After deducting a portion of employees who originally had homes in the countryside or cities and did not need the state to provide dormitories, these dormitories would originally have been sufficient. However, in recent years, especially last year, the number of employees increased excessively, some employees brought dependents when they could have done without, and too many employees requested to bring dependents, causing the dormitory problem to become tense in various places. In these four years, the number of newly added employees requesting state-provided dormitories alone was 5.61 million. Adding in those whose dormitory problems were not resolved before 1952, the contradiction between supply and demand is even greater.

    Can this contradiction be quickly resolved at present? The answer is no. Because to resolve it completely would require at least 112.18 million square meters of dormitories, which, according to the average cost of 57 yuan per square meter of employee dormitories in the previous four years, would require an investment of nearly 6.4 billion yuan.

    In the past four years, the state's investment in employee dormitory construction has reached 3.644 billion yuan, accounting for 8.9% of the total investment in capital construction over the past four years. If the investment increases to 6.4 billion yuan, it will account for 15% of the capital construction investment stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.

    Moreover, simply spending this amount of money is not enough. Because building more dormitories and housing more people requires adding more welfare facilities and public utilities, such as shops, theaters, hospitals, nurseries, primary and secondary schools, post and telecommunications bureaus, barbershops, bathhouses, canteens, and so on. According to surveys in cities such as Baotou and Luoyang, each additional urban resident requires an increase of approximately 1.8 square meters of public service and welfare building area. At an average construction cost of 72 yuan per square meter for public service and welfare buildings, each person requires an additional investment of more than 129 yuan.

    Furthermore, increasing the population also necessitates a corresponding increase in municipal engineering – roads, water supply, drainage, transportation, and so on.

    Combining dormitories, public service and welfare buildings, and municipal engineering, according to preliminary calculations by the State Construction Commission, each additional urban resident requires construction costs of 558 to 695 yuan, and each additional family of employees with dependents (calculated as a family of four) requires construction costs of 2,620 to 3,280 yuan. This figure does not include the investment in various equipment needed for public services, welfare services, and municipal engineering.

    According to a nationwide census of 99 cities conducted by the State Statistics Bureau in September of last year, approximately 1.1 million employees requested family housing. Adding in the newly added employees later, it is estimated that there are approximately 2.5 million employees nationwide. Even if we calculate that 60% of the employees requesting family housing, it would still require single dormitories for 1 million people and family housing for 1.5 million households. To completely solve the dormitory problem for these employees would require at least 4.488 billion to 5.615 billion yuan. This amount of money is approximately equivalent to 70% to 86% of the total investment in industrial construction in our country last year. If this money were used to build steel plants, their production capacity would be greater than the current total steel output of our country. If this money were used to build textile mills, their spindles and looms would be equal to approximately twice the total spindles and looms of our country's textile industry. The state cannot come up with such a huge amount of money, otherwise, it would mean abandoning the Five-Year Plan and socialist construction.

    Unrestrictedly satisfying employees' demands for dormitories, and having the state "take care of" all employee housing, is not only beyond the country's financial capacity but also beyond its material capacity. For example, although we used our greatest efforts to build more than 24 million square meters last year, the increased employees last year requested dormitories totaling more than 44 million square meters. This year, raw materials are particularly scarce, and wood, steel, cement, etc., are not enough. Even if the state has money, it is powerless to build more dormitories.

    So, where is the way out? Judging from the current situation of solving the dormitory problem in various places, there seem to be two ways out: one is to rationally allocate housing so that more people can live in the existing dormitories; the other is to increase dormitory construction area in small and medium-sized cities through employee-funded self-construction or self-construction with public assistance and by lowering construction standards, so that more people can live there. Both can be done and should be done, because the allocation of dormitories in some places is indeed very unreasonable; self-construction, assisted construction, and lowering standards can indeed build more houses. However, both of these methods cannot fundamentally solve the problem, especially the problem in large cities. Because not only are these two methods limited in solving the problem, but even if everyone is housed, the problems of urban public utilities and welfare facilities, municipal construction, etc., still cannot be solved, and solving these problems will in turn lead to dormitory problems.

    So, is there a third way to fundamentally solve the problem? Yes, that is what some people's representatives at this National People's Congress and people here who study economic life problems pointed out: change the method of "taking care of" everything, and handle it separately according to specific conditions and circumstances. For example, family members of employees who can choose not to come to the city or not to come to large and medium-sized cities should not come, family members of employees who can return to the countryside or return home should return, those who can postpone establishing a family should not rush to establish a family, and so on. This not only solves the dormitory problem but also alleviates the current excessive burden on cities and is also very beneficial to the rural economy.

    Some people say: "Five generations under one roof" and "three generations under one roof" are certainly worthy of sympathy, but some "five generations" and "three generations" who were originally living separately should not rush to "live under one roof," and some "five generations" and "three generations" can also develop more slowly.

    According to reports, recently some employees have voluntarily sent their families back to the countryside or small and medium-sized cities. It seems that as long as the reasons are explained clearly, this path can be taken. (Xinhua News Agency Special)

### 宿舍不够怎么办？

    宿舍不够怎么办？
    新华社记者　田林
    在最近闭幕的全国人民代表大会会议上，有些人民代表对解决职工宿舍和制止农村人口流入城市的问题提出了建议。这是一个重大而适时的建议。
    不久以前，我访问了郑州、洛阳、武汉等城市。在这些城市里，我看到职工宿舍栉比林立，有的像工人城，有的像工人村。也就在这些地方，记者却到处听说宿舍不够住，说宿舍情况很紧张。究竟职工宿舍是否盖得太少了呢？根据国家计划委员会和国家建设委员会最近调查的材料来看，职工宿舍不是盖的太少，恰恰相反，盖得太多了。要再大量修建，国家的财力和物力就负担不起了。
    第一个五年计划规定职工宿舍修建面积约为四千六百万平方公尺，这个数字和五年计划规定的生产发展数字相比是适当的。但是，在实行五年计划的前四年中就盖了六千五百一十五万平方公尺，超过五年计划41％以上。如果加上今年已经批准要修建的宿舍，数字就更突出。职工宿舍增加的速度已经远远地超过了我国生产发展的速度。根据计委的初步材料计算，我国工业、手工业、农业和副业的生产总值，1956年虽然已经达到了五年计划规定的1957年的指标，但是仅仅只超过2％多一点。
    这些宿舍，按照编制五年计划时所作定额（带眷职工占60％，每个职工平均占宿舍建筑面积二十平方公尺）计算，可供三百二十多万职工居住。而五年计划规定增加职工的人数不过四百二十二万。除去一部分原在乡村或城市有家不必要国家供给宿舍的职工以外，这些宿舍本来是可以够住的。但是几年来，尤其是去年职工增加过多，有些职工可以不带家眷而带了家眷，以及要求带家眷的职工太多，宿舍问题就在各地紧张起来。在这四年当中，只是新增职工要求国家供给宿舍的就有五百六十一万人。加上1952年以前没有解决宿舍问题的人在内，供求之间的矛盾就更加大。
    这个矛盾目前能否很快得到解决呢？答复是否定的。因为要统统解决，就至少需要一亿一千二百一十八万平方公尺宿舍，按照前四年职工宿舍的平均造价每平方公尺五十七元计算，需要投资近六十四亿元。
    四年来，国家用于职工宿舍建设的投资已达三十六点四四亿元，占四年来基建投资总额的8.9％。如果投资增加到六十四亿元，就将占到五年计划所规定的基建投资的15％。
    而且，单单支出这笔费用还是不够的。因为多修了宿舍，多住了人，就要多添福利设施和公用事业设施，如商店、影剧院、医院、托儿所、中小学、邮电局、理发店、洗澡堂、饭堂等等。根据包头、洛阳等城市的调查，城市人口每增加一个人约需要增加公共事业建筑和福利建筑面积一点八平方公尺。以公共事业建筑和福利建筑平均每平方公尺造价为七十二元计算，每人就又需要增加投资一百二十九元多。
    还有，增加人口还必需相应增加市政工程——道路、供水、排水、交通等等。
    把宿舍、公共事业和福利建筑、市政工程三项合在一起，根据国家建设委员会初步计算，城市人口每增加一人需要建设费用五百五十八元到六百九十五元，每增加一户带眷职工（以全家四口人算）需要建设费用二千六百二十到三千二百八十元。这个数字还没有包括公共事业、福利事业、市政工程所需要的各种设备投资。
    根据国家统计局去年9月对全国九十九个城市的普查，职工要求家属宿舍的约有一百一十万人，加上后来新增加的职工，估计全国共有二百五十万人左右。就按要求家属宿舍的职工占60％计算，也需要住一百万人的单身宿舍和住一百五十万户的家属宿舍。要统统解决这些职工的宿舍问题，至少就需要四十四亿八千八百万元到五十六亿一千五百万元。这些钱约相当于去年我国工业建设全部投资的70％到86％。这些钱如果用来建设钢铁厂，它的生产能力比目前我国钢铁产量的总和还大。这些钱如果用来建设纺织厂，它的纱锭和布机可以等于目前我国纺织工业全部纱锭和布机的两倍左右。这样巨大数量的钱，国家是拿不出来的，否则只有不搞五年计划，不搞社会主义建设。
    无限制地满足职工对于宿舍的要求，要国家把职工宿舍统统“包下来”，不仅国家的财力不能对付，国家的物力也同样不能对付。比如去年虽然用了最大力量修建了二千四百多万平方公尺，而去年增加的职工就要求宿舍四千四百多万平方公尺。今年，原材料特别紧张，木料、钢材、水泥等等都不够用，即使国家有钱，要盖更多的宿舍也无能为力。
    那么，出路在哪里呢？从目前各地解决宿舍问题的情况来看，出路似乎有两条：一是合理分配住房，使现有的宿舍多住一些人；一是在中小城市由职工出资自建或用自建公助的办法和降低建筑标准的办法，来增加宿舍建筑面积，多住一些人。二者都可以办，都应该办，因为有些地方宿舍分配确实很不合理；自建、助建和降低标准确实能多盖房子。但是这二者又都还不能根本解决问题，尤其是不能解决大城市的问题。因为不仅这两种办法解决问题有局限性，而且即使把人都住下去，城市公用事业和福利设施、市政建设等等问题仍然不能解决，而要解决这些问题就又有宿舍问题。
    那么有没有根本解决问题的第三条路呢？有，那就是这次人代会上有些人民代表和此间研究经济生活问题的人士指出的：改变统统“包下来”的办法，按照具体条件和情况分别处理。比如可以不来城市或可以不来大中城市的职工家属不来，可以回乡村或回家的职工家属回去，可以晚一点建立家庭的不要急于建立家庭，等等。这样不仅可以解决宿舍问题，而且可以减轻目前城市的过重负担，对农村经济也很有利。
    有人说：“五世同堂”、“三世同堂”固然值得同情，但是有些原来分居的“五世”和“三世”最好还是不要急于“同堂”，有些“五世”和“三世”还可以发展得慢一些。
    据报载，近来已经有一些职工自动把家眷送回农村或中小城市。看来只要把道理讲清楚，这条路是可以走通的。　（新华社专稿）
