    New "White Paper"
    Cui Qi

    Dulles' recent speeches, filled with hostility towards the Chinese people, remind one of the White Paper on China published by the U.S. State Department eight years ago. At that time, Acheson pinned the United States' hopes of regaining control over China on the "democratic individualists" of China. Today, the Chinese bourgeois rightists' attack on the socialist cause has again intoxicated Acheson's successors. "Like a familiar swallow returning," the American ruling class sees that China's "democratic individualism" seems not to have died out, and so Acheson's illusions are revived. Dulles drunkenly slandered that "the Chinese people are first and foremost individualists" and "do not like communism." He even "confidently" "assumes" that socialist China is a "vanishing" phenomenon.

    "A Convenient Working Hypothesis"

    Why does Dulles have to rehash these delirious ravings eight years after Acheson's illusions were shattered? Needless to say, he is trying to encourage some bourgeois rightists in China to "bravely" attack the socialist cause. However, this is not the whole problem. In fact, even Dulles himself knows that he cannot rally a crowd with a single shout; moreover, his own situation is extremely embarrassing. Dulles is howling in a situation where the current U.S. policy toward China has reached a dead end. He is lying on a stranded ship, yet wants to play the role of a hero, which can only be a low-level farce.

    Dulles said that the reason he believes that socialist China is about to "vanish" is merely "a convenient working hypothesis." The "work" mentioned here refers to the United States' policy and activities of hostility towards the Chinese people. Because the pressure to change the current U.S. policy toward China is growing day by day, both domestically and abroad, Dulles, who stubbornly implements this policy, does indeed feel that it is not "convenient to work." Therefore, Dulles imagined a way out. He told the American public: The People's Republic of China is about to "vanish," why should the United States recognize it? Why should it deal with it? He thought that as long as he shouted this, the resistance to continuing the policy of hostility towards China would be reduced.

    Who is Controlling Dulles' Mouth?

    However, Dulles miscalculated. Even within the United States, there is not much of a market for hostile remarks against China. As for his "hypothesis," it did not make it "convenient to work" for him. Even U.S. Senator Humphrey believes that Dulles' "hypothesis" is "not taking a realistic attitude." The "New York Post" accused Dulles of "daydreaming" and "liking wishful thinking." Gordon Walker, the chief Far East correspondent for the "Christian Science Monitor," also recently opposed Dulles' statement in his dispatch. He wrote that, based on his extensive travel experience in the Far East, "he has not found much opinion anywhere to support the view that the Red Chinese regime is merely temporary." Walker also reported the following: U.S. State Department officials stationed in the Far East "are puzzled about the whereabouts of the painstakingly collected reports they sent to Washington, most of which provided concrete reasons why Mr. Dulles' words are unreasonable."

    Indeed, where did the reports of American diplomats go? This is a mystery. It seems that Dulles does not like these reports, because the content of these reports is fundamentally incompatible with his "convenient working hypothesis." It seems that Dulles does not even need the intelligence of American diplomats. All he needs is the will of the monopoly capital groups. What is Dulles' "hypothesis" based on? Nothing! It is entirely the class instinct and the servility to serve monopoly capital that controls his mouth...

    Artificially Creating a State of Ignorance

    In order to implement the policy of non-recognition of China and hostility towards China, Dulles and his ilk believe that the best way is to prevent the American people from knowing the truth about the new China, or even knowing the existence of the new China. Therefore, for many years, the U.S. State Department has prohibited American citizens from visiting China and American reporters from interviewing in China. In this way, it can implement a comprehensive blockade and distortion of news about the new China, trapping millions of thoughtful American people in a gourd and soaking them in a large vat of rumor and slander.

    However, this artificially created state of ignorance cannot but make the broad masses of the American public feel dissatisfied. In particular, the American press demands the right of free access. This pressure has become greater and greater. Therefore, recently, U.S. Senator Mansfield also believes that U.S. policy toward China is "in an awkward position due to the state of ignorance artificially created by the government."

    This is a difficult problem facing Dulles: If the American people are allowed to know the truth, then the Great Wall built up with lies for eight years will collapse, and the policy toward China built on this will be further shaken; however, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep the American people locked up for a long time. Dulles' recent speech hostile to the Chinese people did not achieve his intended purpose, which proves this.

    What is "Vanishing"?

    Dulles' many speeches about China can be regarded as a sequel to Acheson's White Paper. It is also full of deep-seated hatred for the Chinese people, but it also marks the helpless failure of the U.S. policy toward China. Like Acheson, Dulles asserted that socialist China is about to "vanish." But what exactly is "vanishing"? It is not the revolutionary and construction cause of the Chinese people, but the plans, dreams, and "white papers" of the American ruling class against the Chinese people, one after another. The socialist road chosen by the Chinese people will absolutely not be changed, nor will it be changed! However, can the current U.S. policy toward China be adhered to forever without change? Can its ban on American citizens visiting China and American reporters from interviewing in China also be adhered to forever without change? Let us wait and see what the facts will show.

    新“白皮书”
    崔奇
    杜勒斯最近连续发表的敌视中国人民的演说，使人们想起了八年前美国国务院公布的关于中国问题的白皮书。那时候，艾奇逊曾把美国重新统治中国的希望，寄托在中国的“民主个人主义者”身上。而今天，中国资产阶级右派分子向社会主义事业的进攻，又使艾奇逊的继承者们陶醉了。“似曾相识燕归来”，美国统治集团一看，中国的“民主个人主义”似乎并未绝种，于是艾奇逊式的幻想又复活了。杜勒斯醉熏熏地污蔑说，“中国人民首先是个人主义者”，是“不喜欢共产主义”的。他甚至“有信心地”“假设”社会主义的中国是一种“要消逝的”现象。
    “便于工作的假设”
    在艾奇逊的幻想破灭了八年之后，杜勒斯还要重新咀嚼这些梦呓，这是为什么呢？不消说，他企图鼓励中国的一些资产阶级右派分子“勇敢”地攻击社会主义事业。不过，这并不是问题的全部。其实，连杜勒斯自己也会知道，他并不能振臂一呼而应者云集；何况他本身的处境就是狼狈不堪的。杜勒斯是在美国现行对华政策走入绝路的情况下发出号叫的。他躺在一只搁浅的船上，却想扮演英雄的角色，这只能是一幕低级的滑稽戏而已。
    杜勒斯说，他所以要认为社会主义的中国即将“消逝”，不过是“一种便于工作的假设”。这儿所说的“工作”，就是指的美国敌视中国人民的政策和活动。由于在美国国内和国外，要求改变美国现行对华政策的压力一天天地在增长，因此顽固执行这个政策的杜勒斯的确感到不“便于工作”了。于是，杜勒斯就臆想出一条出路，他向美国公众说：中华人民共和国就要“消逝”了，美国何必承认它呢？何必同它打交道呢？他想，只要这样一喊，那么继续执行敌视中国政策的阻力就会减少了。
    谁在支配着杜勒斯的嘴巴？
    但是，杜勒斯失算了。敌视中国的言论，就是在美国国内也没有多少市场。至于他的“假设”，更没有使他“便于工作”。连美国参议员汉弗来也认为，杜勒斯所说的“假设”是“没有采取现实态度”。“纽约邮报”指责杜勒斯是在“作白日梦”，“喜欢妄想”。“基督教科学箴言报”驻远东首席记者戈登·沃克最近在他的通讯中，也反对杜勒斯的说法。他写道，根据他在远东的广泛旅行的经验，“在任何地方他都没有发现有很多意见足以支持认为赤色中国政权仅仅是暂时的看法”。沃克并且报道了这样一件事情：美国国务院驻远东的官员们“正在对他们给华盛顿送去的辛辛苦苦搜集的报告的下落感到不解，这些报告的大部分提出了具体的理由，证明为什么杜勒斯先生的话是没有道理的”。
    真的，美国外交官员的报告到那儿去了呢？这是一个谜。看来，杜勒斯是不喜欢这些报告的，因为这些报告的内容同他的“便于工作的假设”根本不能相容。看来，杜勒斯甚至连美国外交官的情报也是不需要的，他所需要的只是垄断资本集团的意旨。杜勒斯的“假设”究竟是根据什么东西呢？什么也没有！完全是阶级本能和为垄断资本效劳的奴性，在支配着他的嘴巴……。
    人为地制造无知状态
    为了执行不承认中国和敌视中国的政策，杜勒斯之流觉得最好的办法是让美国人民不知道新中国的真相，甚至不知道新中国的存在。因此，多年以来，美国国务院一直禁止美国公民访问中国，禁止美国记者到中国采访。这样，它就可以对有关新中国的新闻实行全面的封锁和歪曲，把千百万有思想的美国公众都闷在葫芦里，并且泡在一个造谣污蔑的大染缸里。
    可是，这种人为地制造的无知状态，不能不使美国广大公众感到不满。特别是美国新闻界，他们要求自由采访的权利。这种压力已经越来越大了。因此，最近美国参议员曼斯菲尔德也认为，美国对华政策“由于政府人为地造成的无知状态而陷于窘迫的境地”。
    这就是杜勒斯所面临的一个难题：如果让美国人民知道真相，那么八年来用谎言所堆积起来的一条长城就会崩溃，建筑在这上边的对华政策也就会进一步动摇；但是，要想长期把美国人民封锁起来，那也是越来越困难了。杜勒斯最近发表敌视中国人民的演说，并没有达到他预期的目的，这就是证明。
    是什么东西在“消逝”？
    杜勒斯关于中国的许多演说，可以看作是艾奇逊的白皮书的续篇，它同样充满着对中国人民的刻骨的仇视，但同样也标志着美国对华政策的无可奈何的失败。杜勒斯同艾奇逊一样，断言社会主义的中国要“消逝”。可是，究竟是什么东西在“消逝”？不是中国人民的革命事业和建设事业，而是美国统治集团反对中国人民的一个又一个的计划，一个又一个的梦想，一个又一个的“白皮书”。中国人民所选择的社会主义道路，是绝对也不想改变，也不会改变的！但是，美国统治集团的现行对华政策是不是能够永远坚持不改变？它不许美国公民访华，不许美国记者到中国采访的禁令，是不是也能够永远坚持不改变？我们还是等着看事实吧。（附图片）
    这是刊登在美国“圣路易邮电报”上的一张漫画，题目是“它总有一天会倒塌的”。它讽刺杜勒斯妄想中华人民共和国“消逝”的白昼梦。
