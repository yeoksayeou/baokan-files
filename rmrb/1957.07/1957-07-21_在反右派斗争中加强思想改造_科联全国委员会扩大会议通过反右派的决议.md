Xinhua News Agency, July 20th: The enlarged meeting of the National Committee of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies concluded today.

The meeting passed the "Resolution of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies on Opposing Bourgeois Rightists." The resolution stated: The Second Enlarged Meeting of the First National Committee of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies unanimously and severely condemns the organized, planned, and program-driven anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracies of the bourgeois rightists, and solemnly refutes the absurd statements and reactionary behaviors of the bourgeois rightists in the scientific community. The bourgeois rightists attempted to first concentrate their forces to open a breach and seize leadership on the front of scientific undertakings. The "Several Opinions on Issues Concerning China's Scientific System" proposed by Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and others under the overall conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance is an extremely insidious and vicious, thoroughly anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific program, which prominently provides full proof of this.

The resolution pointed out that the emergence of some bourgeois rightists in the national science and technology community, and the presence of rightists like Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang in the Standing Committee of the National CAST, and the fact that some scientists were used by the rightists, deserves profound vigilance from our science and technology community. Some people believe that science and technology workers can ignore politics, no longer need to engage in ideological remolding, and no longer need to study Marxism-Leninism. This is completely wrong.

The resolution called on science and technology workers nationwide, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, to thoroughly draw a line between themselves and the bourgeois rightists politically and ideologically, and to join the people of the whole country in launching an anti-rightist struggle, defeating the rampant attacks of the rightists; to strengthen their ideological remolding in the struggle, to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, to gradually establish and consolidate the proletarian communist world outlook, to better serve socialist construction, so that our socialist revolution can achieve a thorough and complete victory on the political and ideological fronts; to continue to criticize and expose Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang and other rightists in the science and technology community, and to order them to thoroughly confess all anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist thoughts and actions, and conscientiously accept remolding and repent, otherwise they will cut themselves off from the people and suffer the consequences of their own actions.

The meeting also passed the "Resolution on the Future Work Direction and Tasks of the National CAST." The resolution agreed with the opening speech of Chairman Li Siguang and the report made by Vice Chairman Hou Debang on "The Main Work and Future Guidelines and Tasks of the National CAST Since Its Establishment."

    在反右派斗争中加强思想改造
    科联全国委员会扩大会议通过反右派的决议
    据新华社20日讯　中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会全国委员会扩大会议今天闭幕。
    会议通过了“中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会关于反对资产阶级右派分子的决议”。决议说：全国科联第一届全国委员会第二次扩大会议一致严厉谴责资产阶级右派分子有组织有计划有纲领的反党反人民反社会主义的阴谋活动，严正驳斥了科学界的资产阶级右派分子的荒谬言论和反动行为。资产阶级右派分子企图在科学事业的阵地上先集中力量打开缺口夺取领导权，在章罗联盟总的阴谋下，曾昭抡、钱伟长等人所提出的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”这一极为阴险恶毒的彻头彻尾的反党反社会主义科学纲领，就突出地给予了充分证明。
    决议指出，全国科学技术界出现了一些资产阶级右派分子，在全国科联常务委员中也出现了曾昭抡、钱伟长这样的右派分子，而且有一些科学家被右派分子所利用。因此，值得我们科学技术界深刻警惕。有些人认为科学技术工作者可以不过问政治，不必再进行思想改造，不必再学习马克思列宁主义，这是十分错误的。
    决议号召全国科学技术工作者，在中国共产党的领导下同全国人民一道从政治上和思想上彻底同资产阶级右派分子划清界限，投入反右派的斗争，击溃右派分子的猖狂进攻；在斗争中加强自己的思想改造，加强对马克思列宁主义的学习，逐步树立和巩固无产阶级的共产主义世界观，更好地为社会主义建设服务，使我国的社会主义革命在政治战线和思想战线上得到彻底的完全的胜利，继续批判和揭发曾昭抡、钱伟长和科学技术界其他右派分子，责成他们彻底地交代一切反党反人民反社会主义的思想和行动，认真地接受改造，悔过自新，否则将自绝于人民，自食其恶果。
    会议还通过了“关于全国科联今后工作方向与任务的决议”，决议同意主席李四光的开幕词和副主席侯德榜所作“全国科联成立以来主要工作和今后方针任务”的报告。
