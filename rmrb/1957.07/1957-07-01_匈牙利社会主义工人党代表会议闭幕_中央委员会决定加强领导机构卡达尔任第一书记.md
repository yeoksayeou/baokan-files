	Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report, Budapest Dispatch: The National Congress of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, after three days of sessions, closed on June 29th.

	The meetings on the 28th and 29th discussed Kádár's report on the political situation and the tasks of the party made by the Provisional Central Committee, and Marosán's report on the Party Constitution.

	Kish, a member of the Executive Committee of the Party Central Committee, spoke on cadre work on June 28th. He said that in the past twelve years, the party's cadres have worked actively and selflessly for the victory of the great cause of the party and socialism. Therefore, it would be completely unfair to say that the party's entire policy on cadres in the past was wrong and harmful.

	Révai József said at the meeting that because the counter-revolutionaries have not been completely crushed politically and ideologically, it is necessary to concentrate the main firepower to oppose revisionism and the traitorous Nagy-Losonczy group. At the same time, it is also necessary to resolutely oppose "leftist" errors expressed in any form.

	Komócsin, Chairman of the National Executive Committee of the Hungarian Communist Youth League, said in his speech that the Hungarian Communist Youth League has developed greatly. In less than a quarter of a year, the organizations of the League have been established in various large factories. There are now 120,000 League members in the country.

	More than thirty people spoke at the meeting in the past three days. Kádár made a concluding speech. Then, the meeting adopted the resolution of the Party's National Congress and elected the members of the Party Central Committee and the Supervisory Committee according to Szomogyi's proposal. The elected members of the Central Committee are Kádár, Münnich, Fock, Marosán, Kish and other fifty-three people, and there are ten alternate members. Fodor and other seven people were elected as members of the Supervisory Committee.

	Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 30th: According to the announcement of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party on June 29th, the Central Committee newly elected by the Party's National Congress has held a meeting to strengthen the Party's leadership structure.

	The Central Committee strengthened the Executive Committee of the original Provisional Central Committee into a Political Bureau, and co-opted Fock as a member of the Political Bureau, and Komócsin and Nemes as alternate members. There are eleven members of the Political Bureau. The Central Committee strengthened the Secretariat. There are five secretaries in total. Kádár is the First Secretary, and the other four are Fock, Kállai, Kish and Marosán.

	This meeting also expanded the original Inspection Committee (formerly translated as Supervisory Committee – Editor's Note) of the Provisional Central Committee to nine people through co-option. Szomogyi was elected as the Chairman of the Inspection Committee, and the newly elected members also include Vass, Birkás and Nyuhreler.

    党中央执行委员会委员基什6月28日在发言中谈到了干部工作。他说，在过去十二年中，党的干部为了党和社会主义的伟大事业的胜利积极忘我地进行了劳动。因此，如果说过去党在干部方面的全部政策是错误的和有害的，那是完全不公正的。
    雷瓦伊·约瑟夫在会上说，因为反革命分子在政治和思想上还没有完全被粉碎，所以必须集中主要的火力来反对修正主义、反对叛变的纳吉—洛松齐集团。同时还必须坚决反对不论以任何形式表现出来的“左”倾错误。
    匈牙利共产主义青年团全国执行委员会主席科莫钦在发言中说，匈牙利共青团已经有了很大的发展，在不到一个季度内，各个大工厂都建立了团的组织。全国现在已经有十二万团员了。
    三天来在会上发言的共有三十多人。卡达尔最后作了总结性的发言。接着，会议通过了党的全国代表会议的决议，并且根据绍莫吉的建议选举了党中央委员会和监察委员会的委员。当选的中央委员会委员有卡达尔、明尼赫、福克、马罗山、基什等五十三人，候补委员共十人。当选为监察委员会委员的有福道尔等七人。
    新华社布达佩斯30日电　据匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会6月29日公布，新由党的全国代表会议选出的中央委员会已经举行会议，加强了党的领导机构。
    中央委员会把原来临时中央委员会的执行委员会加强成为政治局，并且补选了福克为政治局委员、科莫钦和耐梅什为候补委员。政治局委员共有十一人。中央委员会加强了书记处。书记共有五人。卡达尔为第一书记，其余四人是福克、卡拉伊、基什和马罗山。
