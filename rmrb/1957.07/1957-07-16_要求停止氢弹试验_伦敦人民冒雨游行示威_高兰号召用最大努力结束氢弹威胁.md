    (Dispatch from our correspondent in London, July 14th) The British people held a march and demonstration and mass meeting in London today in the rain for the "March for Life," demanding a halt to hydrogen bomb tests and demanding that the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee immediately reach an agreement on this issue.
    This movement was organized by the British Communist Party's newspaper, the "Daily Worker." At 3:30 PM, a large crowd of workers, shop assistants, intellectuals, and housewives began to depart from Hyde Park.
    The march was led by eighty women wearing black shawls. Following them was a group of children holding balloons of various colors printed with the slogan "Stop Hydrogen Bomb Tests." Then came the contingents of various trade unions and Communist Party regional committees, including representatives from the Midlands and Kent, holding thousands of placards demanding an immediate halt to hydrogen bomb tests. The numbers on the placards indicated that the cost of manufacturing a hydrogen bomb could fund or establish one hundred hospitals, ten nuclear power plants, twenty-five thousand homes, five hundred libraries, ten thousand clubs, or one hundred and fifty schools.
    In the march, mothers pushed their children in strollers, following behind a striking banner that read, "Children's Lives Are Under Threat." Some strollers also had milk bottles hanging on them.
    When the procession passed through Oxford Street and Regent Street, the commercial center of London's West End, it encountered a downpour. The demonstrators, those mothers and children, continued to move forward in the rain. At this time, the police "maintaining order" followed the procession in large trucks. Mounted police in dark blue raincoats followed on either side of the demonstrators, separating the large procession into twelve sections.
    The march entered Trafalgar Square at 4:30 PM and held a massive rally attended by five thousand people. British Communist Party General Secretary Gollan spoke at the meeting. He said, "The most urgent task of our time is to stop the testing of nuclear weapons." He pointed out that the hydrogen bomb is a temptation for aggressors. It seriously increases the danger of war and is also an important cause of tension in the world situation.
    Gollan said, "The hydrogen bomb has enormous destructive power. But there is an even greater force in the world, and that is the power of the people to win and defend lasting peace. In recent months, the potential of the people to eliminate nuclear weapons has been demonstrated. Let us use this power to make a final and greatest effort to end this threat forever."
    Gollan condemned the obstructionist behavior of Western countries in the disarmament negotiations. He said that if the Disarmament Subcommittee ends without reaching an agreement, it would be a crime against humanity.
    The assembly passed a resolution demanding that an agreement be reached immediately on stopping hydrogen bomb tests. This resolution has been delivered by elected representatives to 10 Downing Street, the official residence of the British Prime Minister.

    要求停止氢弹试验
    伦敦人民冒雨游行示威
    高兰号召用最大努力结束氢弹威胁
    本报伦敦14日电　英国人民今天在伦敦冒雨举行“向生命进军”的游行示威和群众大会，要求停止氢弹试验，要求联合国裁军小组委员会立即就这一问题达成协议。
    这次运动是由英共机关报“工人日报”组织的。下午三时半，由工人、店员、知识分子和家庭主妇组成的庞大的群众队伍，开始从海德公园出发。
    游行队伍以八十名围着黑色披肩的妇女为前导。之后，是一队儿童，他们拿着印有“停止氢弹试验”口号的各色气球。然后，是各个工会和共产党地区委员会的队伍，其中包括来自密特兰和肯特的代表，他们举着成千个标语牌，要求立即停止氢弹试验。标语牌上的数字表明，制造一颗氢弹的费用，可以创办或设立一百个医院，十个原子能发电站，两万五千所住宅，五百个图书馆，一万个俱乐部，或者是一百五十所学校。
    在游行队伍中，母亲们用婴儿车推着自己的孩子，跟随着一幅触目惊心的写着“孩子们的生命正受着威胁”的大幅旗帜后面。有一些小车上还挂着盛有牛奶的奶瓶。
    当队伍通过伦敦西区的商业中心牛津街和摄政街时，遇到了倾盆大雨。游行示威的人们，那些母亲和孩子冒雨继续前进。这时候，“维持秩序”的警察们坐在大卡车里尾随着队伍行进。穿着藏青雨衣的骑警则追随在示威者的两侧。他们把这个庞大的队伍分隔成十二段。
    游行队伍在下午四时半进入特拉法加广场，举行有五千人参加的声势浩大的群众大会。英共总书记高兰在会上讲话。他说：“我们当代最紧迫的任务，就是停止核子武器的试验。”他指出，氢弹对于侵略者来说是种诱惑。它严重地增加了战争危险，也是造成世界局势紧张的重要原因。
    高兰说：“氢弹具有极大的摧毁力。但是世界上还有一种更大的力量，这就是人民想要赢得与保卫持久和平的力量。在最近几个月中，人民想要销毁核武器的潜力已经显示出来了。让我们运用这个力量作最后的和最大的努力，来永远结束这种威胁。”
    高兰谴责了西方国家在裁军谈判中的怠工行为。他说，假如裁军小组没有达成协议而结束，这是对人类的罪恶。
    大会通过了要求立即就停止氢弹试验达成协议的决议。这一决议已由推选出来的代表们送到唐宁街十号英国首相官邸。
