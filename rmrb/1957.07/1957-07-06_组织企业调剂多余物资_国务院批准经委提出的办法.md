Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The State Council approved the State Economic Commission's report on organizing the adjustment of surplus materials in enterprise departments in the future on June 25th. It also notified relevant agencies across the country to specifically organize the material adjustment work with reference to the methods for adjusting surplus materials proposed in the State Economic Commission's report, in order to benefit mutual support, adjust what is available and what is lacking, and provide material guarantees for better completion of the national economic plan.

The method for adjusting surplus materials proposed by the State Economic Commission is that first, the People's Committees of each province, city, and autonomous region should establish leading organizations for adjusting inventory surplus materials to be responsible for this work. In order to take care of each department first arranging its annual and quarterly material supply plans within its own department, before each national unified allocation and central department allocation of material orders, a balance adjustment can be carried out within the department's management system, but long-distance transportation and unreasonable transfers should be avoided as much as possible. After each allocation of material orders meeting, all central and local enterprises should report their inventory of surplus materials and urgently needed materials to the local competent authority for adjusting materials according to the prescribed time, and the local authorities will make unified adjustments.

The State Economic Commission's report, approved by the State Council, stated that in order to smoothly carry out the material adjustment work, all departments and provinces and cities need to educate their subordinate units, overcome departmentalism, establish an overall concept, and stop any panic buying and speculative purchasing of materials, as well as improper "barter" practices. It also pointed out that the heads of all enterprises should be responsible for reviewing the surplus materials and urgently needed materials reported by their enterprises.

    组织企业调剂多余物资
    国务院批准经委提出的办法
    据新华社讯　国务院6月25日批准国家经济委员会关于今后组织调剂企业部门库存多余物资问题的报告，并且通知全国有关机关，参照经委报告中提出的调剂多余物资的办法，具体组织物资调剂工作，以利互相支持，调剂有无，为更好地完成国民经济计划提供物资保证。
    经委提出的调剂多余物资的办法，首先是由各省市和自治区人民委员会成立调剂库存多余物资的领导机构，负责这一工作。为照顾各部门首先在本部门内安排好年度和季度的物资供应计划，在每次国家统一分配和中央各部分配的物资订货之前，可先在本部门管理系统内进行平衡调剂，但是应尽可能地避免远距离运输和不合理的调拨。每次分配物资的订货会议以后，中央和地方的所有企业，都应该把库存多余物资和急需的物资，按照规定时间，报送当地调剂物资的主管机构，由当地统一调剂。
    国务院批准的经委的报告中说，为了顺利地进行物资调剂工作，各部门、各省市还需教育所属单位、克服本位主义，树立整体观念，制止任何抢购和套购物资，以及不正当的“物物交换”等作法。并且指出，各企业的负责人，对本企业所报多余物资和急需物资，应负责审核。
