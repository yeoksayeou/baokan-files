Being an official of socialism, eating socialist food, reading socialist books and newspapers, seeing and personally experiencing the glorious achievements of socialist construction, and having eight years pass by without the slightest movement, not only without movement, but also plotting to bite back, only someone with "ulterior ambition" could have such ability.

Some right-wing elements say: the reason they are like this is because they come from the exploiting class; they have received Anglo-American capitalist education; and they have not studied hard, so that their reactionary stance still exists. It is true that the reactionary stance of the right-wing elements is deeply rooted. However, many people with reactionary stances have been reformed; most of those who have not been completely reformed are "stubborn but not solid"; even the stubborn ones do not all cause trouble. The right-wing elements are not like this, they not only have a firm reactionary stance, but also a personal ambition to expand their reactionary stance.

Ambition is a hidden heart, but in fact they have already clearly told people.

Historical ambitious people have two "aphorisms": one is called "He can be replaced." To replace him does not mean that if I take your position, I can do more things, or do more for the people, but it means that if I take your position, I can stand on the head of the people and act like a tyrant, "You can't do it, I'll do it," "Bi-cameral system," "Democratic parties take turns to govern," "Party committees withdraw from schools," "Public representatives withdraw from joint public-private enterprises," and so on. No matter the size of the organ or career, in a word, I want to "replace him." Haven't they already been given positions under the state's policies of "contracting" and "appropriate arrangements"? Some positions are already very high. But they say it's not enough, although the official position is high and the salary is generous, they can't freely "piss" on the heads of the people.

The other sentence is: "To be under one person, to stretch above ten thousand people." Ambitious people know that the people are their enemies, so they need a backstage, otherwise they cannot stand firm. The emperors who used to "stretch above ten thousand people" recognized heaven as their father, saying they were the "sons of heaven." Conceptually, the powerful "heaven" could be their father. In reality, powerful people—foreign aggressors—could even more be their fathers. From Shi Jingtang to Empress Dowager Cixi, Yuan Shikai, and Chiang Kai-shek, it was all like this. The right-wing elements have not neglected this tradition. They said to the American imperialists: "You bought the wrong horse." The American imperialists probably learned a lesson from their failure. From Acheson to Dulles, they have pinned their hopes of aggression on so-called Chinese democratic individualists. Just when the right-wing elements were clamoring, Dulles gave a speech in which he said: "The Chinese people are first and foremost individualists. We are confident in using this assumption as the basis of our policy: the enforced uniformity of international communism, in China and elsewhere, is a passing rather than a permanent phenomenon." Dulles and the right-wing elements had the same clever plan: China would be in great chaos, and the Communist Party would not be able to stand firm. "Individualists" will make the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system "disappear." I am not saying that the right-wing elements have colluded with the aggressors, but if anyone wants to collude with imperialism to oppose the motherland, his ending is very clear. The fact is obvious, without the Communist Party, it is not that the country will not be destroyed, but that it will be destroyed immediately.

Ambition, it is said, "is born in the heart, harms the cause, is born in the cause, harms the government." It can stifle a person's wisdom, making them unable to see themselves, nor can they see others. "An ant trying to shake a big tree is laughable and does not measure its own strength." The tragedy of the right-wing gentlemen is here. But the bigger tragedy is yet to come. Not only are the people of the whole country denouncing them, but more importantly, the aggressors on the other side of the Pacific and the traitorous bandits in Taiwan are cheering for them and paying their respects from afar.

Some people say: I didn't start the fire, I was used by the right-wing. The one who presides over the fire is the great ambitious, and those who are sent to start the fire and those who are ignited by the fire must also have "gunpowder" hidden in their bodies. Those who gloat and try to take advantage of the fire, regardless of whether their ambition is big or small, obvious or latent, must expose and confess it themselves, and then they can abandon it. This is a gate. Leaving this gate is beyond transformation, called "self-severance from the people." Turning back from here, crushing ambition—Dulles calls it individualism, anyway, it's the same—then you can return to the standpoint of the people, return to the standpoint of socialism, and become a new socialist person. A butcher knife, no matter whether it is hidden under the clothes or in other secret places, cannot pretend to be a Buddha. Only by putting down the butcher knife can one become a Buddha on the spot.

    野心
    谢觉哉
    做社会主义之官，吃社会主义之饭，读社会主义之书和报，看到并亲自体验到社会主义建设之辉煌成就，时间经过了八年，而一点无动于衷，不仅无动于衷，且要阴谋反噬，不是“别具野心”的人，不可能有这等本事。
    有的右派分子说：他们之所以这样，是出身剥削阶级；受过英美资本主义教育；加上没有好好学习，以致反动立场仍然存在。不错，右派分子的反动立场是根深蒂固的。但不少有反动立场的人，已得到了改造；未完全改造过的人也多数是“顽而不固”；就是顽固的人也不都闹事。右派分子不这样，他们不是只有坚定的反动立场，而且有要扩张其反动立场的个人野心。
    野心者不可告人之心也，其实他们也已经明白地告诉人了。
    历史上的野心家有两句“隽语”：一句叫“彼可取而代也”。取而代之，并不是说我取了你的地位，比你能多做事、能多为人民服务，而是说取了你的地位，好站在人民的头上作威作福，“你不行，我来”、“两院制”、“民主党派轮流执政”、“党委退出学校”、“公方代表退出公私合营企业”及其他等等，机关事业不论大小，一句话，我要“取而代之”。他们不是已在国家“包下来”和“适当安排”的政策下都有了地位吗，有的职位已经很高。但他们说，不过瘾，虽然是官高禄厚，却不能自由地在人民的头上“洒尿”。
    另一句话是：“屈于一人之下，伸于万人之上”。野心家知道人民是他们的对头，因此需要有后台，不然就站不住。以前“伸于万人之上”的皇帝，认天做老子，说自己是“天子”，概念上有势力的“天”可以做老子，实际上，有势力的人——外国的侵略者更可以做老子。从石敬瑭到西太后、袁世凯、蒋介石都是如此。右派分子也并没忽视这个传统。他们对美帝国主义者说：“你们买错了马”。美帝国主义者大概也从失败中吸取了教训，从艾奇逊到杜勒斯都已经把侵略的希望寄托在所谓中国民主的个人主义者身上。恰恰就在右派分子嚣张的时候，杜勒斯发表了演说，他说：“中国人民首先是个人主义者。我们有信心把这样一种假设作为我们政策的根据：国际共产主义的强求一致的统治，在中国和其他地方一样，是一种要消逝的而不是一种永久的现象”。杜勒斯和右派分子的妙算一样：中国即会大乱，共产党站不住了。“个人主义者”即会使共产党的领导和社会主义制度“消逝”。我不是说右派分子和侵略者已有甚么勾结，但是，如果谁想勾结帝国主义来反对祖国，他的结局是很清楚的。事实很明显，没有共产党不是不会亡国，而是马上要亡国的。
    野心这东西，叫做“生于其心，害于其事，生于其事，害于其政”。它能扼杀人的智慧，使之看不清自己，也看不清别人。“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”。右派先生们的悲剧，就在这里。但大的悲剧还在后面。不仅是全国人民在向他们声讨，而重要的是太平洋彼岸的侵略者和台湾的卖国匪帮正在向他们欢呼并遥致敬意。
    有人说：我没有点火、我是被右派利用了。主持点火的是大野心者，被派去点火和一被点就着了的人，身上必然也藏有“焰硝”。幸灾乐祸，企图趁火打劫的人，不管他的野心大或小，显著或潜伏，都要做到自己把它揭露、交代，然后能把它抛弃。这是一个关，出此关就是化外，叫做“自绝于人民”。从这里回头，把野心——杜勒斯把它叫个人主义，总之是一样——粉碎，然后可以回到人民的立场，回到社会主义的立场，成为社会主义的新人。　　屠刀，不论是藏在衣底或其他秘密的地方，都无法假装为佛的，只有放下屠刀，才可以立地成佛。
