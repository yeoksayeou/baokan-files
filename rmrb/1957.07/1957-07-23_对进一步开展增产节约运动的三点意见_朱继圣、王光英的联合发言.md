We fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou and the government's leaders, as well as Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen, and express our heartfelt support.

From the reports, we see the great achievements of the country's socialist construction and that our country's first Five-Year Plan can be completed and overfulfilled on schedule. These inspiring great achievements truly fill us with infinite joy and encouragement.

**The Facts of Tianjin's Industrial Development Shatter the Rightists' Lies**

However, a small handful of frantic bourgeois right-wing elements do not feel this way. They are taking advantage of the opportunity to help the Party rectify its work style, spreading absurd anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, and launching a frenzied attack on the Party and the people of the whole country, vainly attempting to seize this opportunity to bring down the Party, overthrow the leadership of the working class, and plot a capitalist restoration. Both of us are industrialists and businessmen, working in Tianjin. In May of this year, we also inspected the development of industrial production increase and economy practice in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. We are willing to refute these right-wing elements with these ironclad facts.

First, looking at Tianjin City, industrial production has increased fivefold in eight years, and the number of workers has doubled. During the first Five-Year Plan period, industrial production increased by an average of 21 percent each year, reaching the planned level one year ahead of schedule. Many precision machines and some products with higher technical levels that could not be manufactured in the past can now be manufactured. Since the vigorous development of the increase production and economy practice movement this year, more than 10,000 rationalization proposals submitted by employees have been adopted and put into production, which can create a value of more than 22 million yuan. Therefore, although the supply of raw materials has been quite tight in the past six months, production has still increased by 12.8 percent compared with the same period last year, successfully completing 51.4 percent of the annual plan. Even combining our original enterprises—Tianjin Renli Wool Textile Factory and Modern Chemical Factory—they have also achieved rapid development after joint operation. The equipment has been expanded, the number of employees has increased, and the variety, quantity, quality, and labor productivity of products have also been significantly increased and improved.

During this trip to Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other cities, we also saw the vigorous development of the increase production and economy practice movement. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the enthusiasm of the vast number of employees has been unprecedentedly high. Generally, they find out the key problems existing in the enterprise and set economy targets through methods such as investigating waste, checking quality, comparing advanced practices, and carefully calculating accounts. In terms of administrative leadership, the spirit of striving to increase production while practicing economy on the premise of ensuring and improving quality has been implemented. Therefore, the planned targets for increasing production and economy practice in the first quarter of this year in each city have been successfully completed, and the results will be even more significant as the second quarter is deepened. Just the amazing achievements in production that we have personally seen are enough to fully illustrate the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. That small handful of right-wing elements vainly attempt to obliterate the facts and use rhetoric to confuse us and lead us to take the old road. We will never be deceived by them. We understand that continuing to deeply accept transformation and smoothly pass through the transition period is the greatest interest of industrialists and businessmen. The absurd anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks spread by Zhang Naiqi and Bi Mingqi in the industrial and commercial circles are futile. We will definitely draw a clear line with these right-wing elements, fight to the end, and never stop until victory.

**Opinions on Further Developing the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement**

Below are some of our experiences and immature opinions on further developing the increase production and economy practice, for reference.

1.  **Regarding the Cooperative Relationship Between Industry and Trade:**

    *Suggest that each province and city establish an authority to strengthen cooperation between industrial and trade departments.*

    At present, there are still some uncoordinated phenomena between industry and trade, which affect the further development of the increase production and economy practice to varying degrees. For example, in terms of raw material supply, some trade departments have not well implemented the spirit of serving production and consumption, and their understanding of the needs of industrial production is insufficient, causing undue losses to the industrial side. According to the feedback from Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuxi and other places, many of the imported Syrian cotton, Uruguayan wool, and Indian and Pakistani jute are of poor quality and contain many impurities, which do not meet the contract requirements, thus affecting the quality, cost, and production plan of the products. We believe that when purchasing imported raw materials, special personnel should be sent to be responsible for inspection before shipment to overcome these shortcomings. In addition, the main raw material Zhejiang jute required by the Zhejiang Jute Textile Factory, because the trade department has not paid enough attention to the technical guidance that should be combined with the needs of the factory in terms of degumming processing by farmers, the quality of the original jute has declined, affecting the production of jute textiles. We believe that the two departments of industry and trade should closely cooperate in the work of providing technical guidance to farmers. These examples are not isolated. If industry and trade can strengthen cooperation, we believe that these shortcomings can be overcome. For example, the Hangzhou silk reeling industry sent people to closely cooperate with the trade department to collect cocoons in the countryside and provide technical guidance, which has achieved good results and is a good experience worthy of attention. Another example is a book cover painted cloth produced by the Tianjin Modern Chemical Factory, which is most suitable for six-pound wide-faced fine cloth, while the trade department used to supply mostly twelve-pound white cloth (the width is also relatively narrow), which wasted cotton cloth and cotton yarn. The bookbinding industry also complained that the painted cloth was too thick and not easy to use. The wrangling between industry and trade lasted for a long time, and it was not resolved until the municipal party committee handled it and fully supplied six-pound wide-faced fine cloth. Through the cooperation between industry and trade, just calculating the task of producing 20,000 pieces of book cover painted cloth by the Modern Chemical Factory for the whole year, calculating the cotton yarn saved from weaving and the extra book covers cut out, it can increase production by more than 1 million yuan for the country throughout the year.

    In addition, there are also uncoordinated phenomena between industry and trade in terms of production arrangements and product acceptance. Some industrial departments have reported that the industrial plan does not count, and the commercial department has the final say; the production arrangement plan of some commercial departments comes down late, making it impossible for the industrial quarterly production plan to connect; in product acceptance, wrangling things happen constantly; in profit distribution, they also feel that commerce is too high and industry is too low, and they demand reasonable adjustments to processing fees.

    The issue of strengthening the cooperative relationship between industry and trade is an important link in further developing the increase production and economy practice. The central government has already noticed this. We believe that if the planning committees of each province and city strengthen management in this regard, establish an authority, and promptly discover and solve problems through scheduling and inspection, so that it can play the role of the production command, it can strengthen cooperation and reduce wrangling. In addition to this, our opinion is whether we can have more "designated factories" between industries, connecting factories that are related in production and sales or in work procedures for fixed supply, allowing them to solve problems such as supply and sales, specifications, and quality through cooperation. This not only allows the production and sales parties to play a role in mutual supervision, but also improves quality, reduces costs, and reduces disputes over raw material supply and acceptance. The trade department can still control and guide through certain procedures, so as not to affect the plan and profit turnover. This can promote the enthusiasm and initiative of grassroots factories and tap more potential productivity.

2.  **Regarding Enterprise Leadership:**

    *Suggest that the central government hand over the specific leadership of enterprises to local governments and increase the power of grassroots enterprises.*

    According to our understanding, at present, the central government and local governments do not cooperate enough in terms of production leadership for the central directly-affiliated factories scattered in various places, and the spirit of dual leadership of the central government and local governments has not been well implemented, affecting the positive role of local governments and hindering the further development of the increase production and economy practice. For example, the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill and the Tianjin Public-Private Joint Venture Lizhong Acid Factory both need iron sulfide as raw material, but due to different equipment, the paper mill needs powder, and the acid factory needs lumps, while the supply of raw materials is a mixture of lumps and powder. If the two factories cooperate and exchange the lumps and powder to make full use of them, it will be beneficial to both parties. However, due to the different leadership systems, the exchange problem between the two parties cannot be well resolved. The powder left over from Lizhong has no use and can only be used to fill the ground, while the paper mill hires people to smash the lumps into powder, wasting a lot of manpower and material resources. Another example is that after the Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill was placed under the leadership of the central government, because it had to frequently ask the central government for instructions, more than half of the heads of functional departments were stationed in Beijing, spending half a year on the work of asking for instructions. Therefore, we believe that in the future, the central government may consider only focusing on the big picture and grasping planning targets, and the specific leadership work can be delegated to the local party committees and administrations; at the same time, it can also consider increasing the power of grassroots enterprises, so that they can play their initiative, flexibility, and adaptability under planning control, and establish a system in the enterprise to link the enthusiasm of employees with the enterprise's planning and reward system, to more effectively mobilize all positive factors.

3.  **Regarding the Exchange of Experience and Technology:**

    *Experience and technology should be exchanged in many ways.*

    At present, many places attach importance to the exchange of experience and technology between ports, which is a good phenomenon, but some do not pay enough attention to local exchange work, and there is a tendency to focus on learning from other places. In addition, there are still undue confidentiality boundaries in the exchange of experience and technology, which affect the further improvement of technology. Due to time constraints, I will not give more examples. As for the experimental research work of the central government and local governments in the industrial field, there is also a phenomenon that each holds its own ground and fails to communicate and cooperate. We believe that in order to improve the level of production technology in our country as soon as possible, we should closely coordinate the design, research, experimentation, and production links, and link factories, schools, research, experimentation, and design departments into an organic whole to overcome the current shortcomings. This can not only effectively improve the level of production technology, but also is a major force in promoting the increase production and economy practice.

    These opinions of ours may be very one-sided. Please correct us, representatives.

    对进一步开展增产节约运动的三点意见
    朱继圣、王光英的联合发言
    我们完全同意周总理和政府各位首长以及彭真副委员长的报告，并表示衷心拥护。
    我们从报告中看到国家的社会主义建设的丰功伟绩和我国第一个五年计划完全可以如期完成和超额完成这些振奋人心的伟大成就后，真使我们感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。
    天津工业发展的事实粉碎了右派谎言
    但是竟有一小撮丧心病狂的资产阶级右派分子并不是这样感受的，他们竟利用帮助党进行整风的机会，散布反党、反社会主义的荒谬言论，向党、向全国人民猖狂进攻，妄想抓住这个机会把党整垮，推翻工人阶级的领导，阴谋资本主义复辟。我们二人都是工商业者，工作岗位都在天津，今年五月间又到上海、杭州等地视察了工业增产节约的开展情况，我们愿意把这些铁的事实对右派分子进行驳斥。
    首先就天津市来看，八年来工业生产增长了五倍，工人增长了两倍；在第一个五年计划期间工业生产每年平均增长百分之二十一，提前一年达到了计划水平，许多过去不能制造的精密机器和一些技术水平较高的产品也能制造了。今年大力开展了增产节约运动以后，职工提出的合理化建议已被采纳投入生产的就有一万多件，可以创造价值二千二百多万元。因此，这半年来虽然原料供应情况相当紧张，而仍能比去年同期增产百分之十二点八，顺利地完成全年计划的百分之五十一点四。就是结合到我们原来经营的企业——天津仁立毛纺织厂和近代化学厂，合营后也都得到飞跃发展，设备扩充了，职工增加了，产品的品种、数量、质量和劳动生产率也都有了显著的增加和提高。
    我们这次在上海、杭州等市也同样看到了增产节约运动的蓬勃开展情况，在党的统一领导下，广大职工的积极性空前高涨，一般都是通过查浪费、查质量、比先进、算细账的方法，找出企业中存在的关键问题，定出节约指标。在行政领导方面则贯彻了以保证和提高质量为前提厉行节约努力增产的精神。所以本年第一季度各该市的增产节约计划指标都已顺利完成，第二季度深入开展下去，成绩将更加显著。只就我们亲身看到的一些生产上惊人的成就，已经可以充分说明了中国共产党领导的英明正确和社会主义制度的无比优越性，那一小撮右派分子妄想抹煞事实，用花言巧语来迷惑我们走回头路，我们是绝不受他们的欺骗的。我们懂得继续深入地接受改造、平平稳稳地渡过过渡时期，是工商业者的最大利益。章乃器、毕鸣岐在工商界中所散布的反党、反社会主义的荒谬言论是枉费心机的。我们一定和这些右派分子划清界限，斗争到底，不到胜利，决不收兵。
    对进一步开展增产节约运动的意见
    下面再就我们的一些体会，对进一步开展增产节约提出几点不成熟的意见，供作参考。
    一、关于工贸之间的协作关系：
    建议各省市设立一个权力机构，加强工业与贸易部门的协作
    目前工贸之间还存在一些不够协调的现象，在不同程度上影响了增产节约的进一步开展。例如原料供应方面，有些贸易部门没有很好地贯彻为生产和消费服务的精神，对工业生产的需要了解不够，使工业方面遭到不应有的损失。据天津、上海、杭州、无锡各方面的反映，进口叙利亚的棉花、乌拉圭的羊毛、印度和巴基斯坦的黄麻很多是质次杂多，不符合合同规定，因而影响了产品的质量、成本和生产计划。我们认为购买进口原料，应派专人在装运之前负责检验，才能克服这些缺点。再有浙江麻纺织厂需用的主要原料浙江黄麻，由于贸易部门对于农民加工脱胶方面应结合工厂需要进行技术指导这一点注意不够，使原麻产质量下降，影响了麻织品的生产。我们认为工贸两个部门应密切配合对农民进行技术指导的工作。这些例子并不是个别的，如果工贸之间能够加强协作，我们相信这些缺点是可以克服的。例如杭州缫丝工业派人与贸易部门密切协作，下乡收茧，并进行技术指导，收到了很好的效果，就是值得注意的好经验。又如天津近代化学厂生产的一项书皮漆布，最适宜用六磅宽面细布，而贸易部门过去供应的大部分是十二磅白布（幅面还比较窄），既浪费了棉布，又浪费了棉纱，制本业还嫌漆布厚不好用。工贸之间扯皮很久，经市委处理才得到解决，充分供应了六磅宽面细布，通过工贸之间的协作，只就近代化学厂全年生产书皮漆布这一项的任务两万匹计算，从织布节约棉纱，多裁了书皮来算一笔总账，全年就可为国家增产一百多万元。
    此外在生产安排及产品验收方面，工贸之间也存在着不够协调的现象。有些工业部门反映说：工业的计划不算数，商业部门说了算；有的商业部门生产安排计划下来得晚，使工业的季度生产计划衔接不上；在产品验收上，不断有些扯皮的事发生；在利润分配上也感到商业偏高、工业偏低，要求对工缴费加以合理调整。
    关于加强工贸之间的协作关系问题，是进一步开展增产节约的一个重要环节，中央已经注意到此。我们认为如果由各省市的计划委员会加强这方面的管理，设立一个权力机构，通过调度和检查及时发现问题、解决问题，使其发挥生产指挥部的作用，是可以加强协作、减少扯皮的。除此，我们的意见是否可以在工业之间多搞些“定位厂”，把产销上或工序上有联系的工厂串连起来固定供应，让它们自己通过协作来解决供销、规格、质量等方面的问题。这样不仅产销双方可以起到相互督促的作用，同时也可以提高质量、降低成本，减少原料供应和验收上的纠纷。在贸易部门仍可通过一定手续加以掌握和指导，不致影响计划和利润上缴。这样可以促进基层厂发挥积极性和主动性，能挖出更多的潜在生产力。
    二、关于企业领导的问题：
    建议中央把企业的具体领导工作交给地方去作，并增加基层企业的权力
    根据我们了解，目前中央与地方，对散在各地方的中央直属厂，在生产领导方面配合不够，没有很好地贯彻中央与地方双重领导的精神，影响了地方上的积极作用，也阻碍了增产节约进一步开展。例如国营天津造纸厂和天津公私合营利中酸厂都需用硫化铁做原料，但由于设备不同，造纸厂需要粉末，酸厂需要块，而原料的供应则块末混合在一起，如果两厂通过合作，把原料块末互相交换充分利用，对于双方都是有利的。但由于领导系统不同，双方在交换上的问题，就不能很好解决。利中剩下来的末没有用途只好填地，造纸厂则雇人把块砸成粉末，浪费了不少人力物力。又如杭州华丰造纸厂划归中央领导后，因须经常向中央请示，职能科的负责人半数以上常驻北京，一年内有半年的时间耗费到请示工作中去。因此，我们认为今后中央是否可以考虑只从大处着眼，抓计划指标，具体领导工作可以下放到地方党委和行政去作；同时也可以考虑增加基层企业的权力，使其能在计划控制下发挥主动性、灵活性和适应性，并在企业中建立制度，把职工的积极性和企业的计划性以及奖励制度联系起来，更有效地来调动一切积极因素。
    三、关于经验技术交流方面的问题：
    应当多方面交流经验和技术
    目前各地多重视到埠际间的经验技术交流，这是很好的现象，但也有的对于本地的交流工作重视不够，有偏重向外地学习的趋向。此外在经验技术交流方面也还存有不应有的保密界限，影响了技术的进一步提高。因为时间关系不再多举例子。至于中央和地方在工业方面的试验研究工作，也还有各抱一摊未能沟通情况通力协作的现象。我们认为为了尽快地提高我国的生产技术水平，应该把设计、研究、试验、生产各个环节紧密配合起来，使工厂、学校、研究、试验以及设计部门联成一个有机体，来克服当前存在的缺点，这不仅可以有效地提高生产技术水平，同时也是推动增产节约的重大力量。
    我们这些意见可能是很片面的，还请各位代表指正。
