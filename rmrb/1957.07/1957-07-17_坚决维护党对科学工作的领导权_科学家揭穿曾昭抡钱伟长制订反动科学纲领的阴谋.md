Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Scientists continued to hold symposiums today to criticize the anti-socialist scientific program of bourgeois rightists and counter the rightists' attack on the scientific field.

Today's symposium was presided over by Zhang Jingfu, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Fourteen scientists spoke at the meeting, and three submitted written statements.

Zhao Jiuzhang criticized the slogan of "protecting scientists" in the anti-socialist scientific program in his speech, pointing out that this was a complete slander against the Party. He believes that the Party truly protects and cares for scientists. After the intellectuals' conference, the Party took many measures to ensure scientists' working time. He himself can usually spend four-sixths or five-sixths of his time on research work. He said that thanks to the Party's support for scientific research, the working conditions of Chinese scientists have been greatly improved. Taking meteorology as an example, it was fundamentally impossible to use Chinese data for meteorological research during the Anti-Japanese War. In the eight years since liberation, the number of meteorological observatories and stations in my country has increased from less than 100 in the early days of liberation to 1,377 now, and the number of upper-air meteorological stations has increased from a few in the past to 70 now. Zhao Jiuzhang said that when he was in Japan recently, the American representative expressed surprise at the development of China's meteorological research work.

He questioned whether Zeng Zhaolun's claim that the contradiction between universities and research institutes is very large is a man-made provocation or an objective fact? He used the Institute of Geophysics as an example to illustrate that this research institution not only supported industrial sectors (Ministry of Geology, Meteorological Bureau), but also carried out extensive cooperation with Peking University, Wuhan University, and Beijing Institute of Geological Exploration. Some majors in these universities were established with the assistance of the institute, and there was no contradiction between them.

Qian Weichang and Zeng Zhaolun are ambitious people in the scientific community. Their practices are consistent with the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Qian Xuesen refuted the rightists' claim that scientific research should be completely free, without planning or organization. Qian Xuesen said that it is no longer the handicraft era of scientific research, and scientific research must be carried out in a planned manner. It is completely impossible to conduct modern scientific research without planning. Qian Xuesen pointed out that Qian Weichang's anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks are not accidental. Qian Xuesen said that Qian Weichang has not yet fully recognized the crimes he committed. Qian Weichang's statement that Tsinghua University should be run like the California Institute of Technology (formerly mistaken for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) may seem insignificant, but his spreading of this capitalist school system and his activities throughout the country are an act of rebellion against the people and the Party. Qian Xuesen also exposed Qian Weichang's consistent two-faced tactics. On the one hand, he approved the second five-year plan of the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the academic committee of the Institute of Mechanics, saying that the plan was "not vigorous enough" and "not done enough"; on the other hand, he said at Tsinghua University that this plan would not work and would "definitely be smashed to pieces and collapse," implying that he wanted to start a new set of things at Tsinghua. Qian Xuesen said that Qian Weichang is completely a liar who uses political tactics and has no scientific flavor at all. He is the most vicious and ruthless political careerist.

Yang Shixian said that Zeng Zhaolun's becoming an important figure in the Luo Longji clique had a long history (in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War). Yang Shixian pointed out that Zeng Zhaolun not only wanted to "compete with the Communist Party," but also wanted to replace it. Didn't he say that "laymen cannot lead experts"? When formulating the twelve-year science vision plan last year, Zeng Zhaolun, as a member of the Science Planning Committee, did not formally raise his opinions at the meeting, but asked Qian Weichang to first feel out the situation and create an opposition plan, attempting to use the hat of the China Democratic League and tens of thousands of senior intellectuals to pressure the leadership of the Science Planning Committee and attempt to win over some masses among intellectuals. This approach is consistent with their assessment of the overall national situation and with all the actions of the Zhang-Luo alliance. Zeng Zhaolun's claim that this group was proposed temporarily and accidentally and was used by Zhang and Luo is completely a deceptive rhetoric that must be exposed. Yang Shixian also represented Ye Qisun, Huang Ziqing, Yun Ziqiang, Liu Dagang, Hua Luogeng and others in exposing Qian Weichang for submitting a provocative proposal during the second plenary meeting of the academic departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and urging several academic department members to sign it. This proposal was sent out without discussion. He questioned Qian Weichang: What were you trying to do by proposing in this proposal that "there are still opposition to scientific research in higher education institutions, especially unfair attacks on scientific research," and suggesting that the academic department assembly "publicly criticize" it? You told me more than once that the work of the academic department organization was not done well. Is this the kind of organizational work you wanted to do?

Zhang Guangdou said that Qian viciously attacked the scientific system stipulated by the Party, calling it the source of "departmentalism" and "gradually forming a wall between units." In essence, Qian did not like this scientific system and was attacking the Party's leadership. Qian proposed that research work should "accommodate people." Zhang Guangdou said that if scientific research work "accommodates people," it would disperse the strength, and the content of research work would also be determined by people's interests and expertise, without organization or planning. This bourgeois scientific work line cannot meet the needs of socialist construction.

Rightists advocate replacing the socialist scientific line with the bourgeois scientific line and abolishing the Party's leadership.

He said that Qian said in the "Zhengming" (Contending) magazine that there is no organization in our country that can uniformly manage the research work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, higher education institutions, and enterprises. The Science Planning Committee only manages the plan, not the funding or conditions. The academic departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences only manage the work of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. These words are essentially against the overall leadership of the Science Planning Committee, against the academic leadership of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and more fundamentally, against the Party's leadership. Zhang Guangdou pointed out that Qian also has a set of claims against the Party's leadership in higher education institutions. He proposed the bourgeois teaching line to confront the socialist teaching line proposed by the Party. He proposed "professors governing the school," establishing a "professors' association," and "decentralizing human rights," "decentralizing funding rights," and "decentralizing teaching rights," with the "Party committee responsible for managing affairs" and so-called "ideological work." He also proposed "openly running the Party" and "allowing the masses to participate in Party affairs," which is clearly to abolish the Party's leadership.

Huang Ziqing said that he has known Zeng Zhaolun for more than thirty years, and they were classmates in their youth. He understands that Zeng's character is consistently good at seizing power and manipulating power, judging people rather than things, and using personal likes and dislikes as the standard. Zeng Zhaolun controlled the Chinese Chemical Society for more than twenty years, and was the main figure in the Chinese Chemical Society from its establishment to 1952. The crux of the disunity in China's chemical community is mainly due to Zeng's bossy style. Zeng excluded dissidents in the Chinese Chemical Society and excluded some highly prestigious chemists from the Chinese Chemical Society. The journal of the Chinese Chemical Society, the Chinese Chemical Society Journal (now the Chinese Journal of Chemistry), has always been controlled by him alone. The editorial committee was entirely decided by him, and the publication of articles was also decided by him. It was not until 1952, when the Chinese Chemical Society held a congress in Beijing, that the situation of Zeng's control was changed based on the opinions of the masses and the Chinese Chemical Society was re-elected. Since then, the Chinese Journal of Chemistry has truly embarked on the right track. Huang Ziqing also cited several examples to illustrate that Zeng is a typical example of power manipulation. He said that when the Chinese Chemical Society held a meeting in 1956, the representatives were all nominated by Zeng. Zeng divided the representatives into three categories: specially invited representatives, ordinary representatives, and observers. At that time, Professor Fu Ying was nationally known in the field of colloid chemistry, but he did not even have the qualifications of an observer because Zeng did not like Fu. However, there was a teaching assistant who graduated in 1948 on the list of specially invited representatives. In the early days of liberation, the Chinese Academy of Sciences wanted to create chemical terms. Zeng was the president of the Chinese Chemical Society at that time, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences asked him to nominate candidates. Zeng nominated almost all organic chemists at that time, but there were no scientists in inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, etc. The chemical terms created in this way were of course unsuitable and unsatisfactory. Later, under the criticism of the chemical community, Zeng Zhaolun had no choice but to establish a term research committee, expanding it to more than 100 people, deliberately dispersing the strength, making it unable to function at all.

Zhang Wei pointed out that Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang said that the formulation of the anti-socialist scientific program was an accidental event in a short period of time, which is not in line with the facts. He believes that their activities are "planned in secret rooms and ignited at the grassroots level." He said that the China Democratic League's temporary research group on "scientific planning issues" was established on May 13, but the facts confessed by Zeng Zhaolun show that Zeng had exchanged opinions with Zhang and Luo on scientific system issues as early as Beidaihe in August last year. A letter from the China Democratic League to the Science Planning Committee also stated that they had solicited opinions on scientific system issues from league members in various places in April and May. This letter concentratedly illustrates that their conspiracy activities were not a matter of a day or two. Zhang Wei said that Zhang Bojun mentioned in his confession that Zeng Zhaolun, Qian Weichang, and Fei Xiaotong had visited him on June 5. Zhang Wei questioned what Zeng and Qian had planned in Zhang's secret room besides planning this anti-socialist scientific program. Zhang Wei also exposed the fact that Qian Weichang was igniting fires everywhere. June 6 was Qian's busiest day. After returning to Tsinghua University from the emergency meeting convened by Zhang Bojun, he held a discussion with students on the election of the president of Tsinghua University from 3:00 to 5:00 p.m., and students visited him again from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. The impression Qian gave to the students at that time was that he was afraid that the world would not be chaotic. After 6:00 p.m., Qian went to see the big-character posters again. When he met a teacher in the campus who was not very familiar with him, Qian enthusiastically asked him if he was planning to speak at the "free forum." Qian could ask students to find him. Zhang Wei said that he has worked with Qian since 1947. He believes that Qian's anti-Party remarks and actions are not accidental. He said that the Party has always trusted and valued Qian Weichang, but Qian has been superficially showing progress since the beginning of liberation, but secretly doing his best to slander the Party. During the adjustment of departments, Qian and Fei Xiaotong came up with a plan of "ten colleges and thirty-two departments" to confront the then Ministry of Education's plan for the adjustment of departments. He said that Qian is the vice president of Tsinghua University and has participated in the research of many major affairs of the school, but he said that he has power without responsibility; and Qian did not consult with any of the school's leaders beforehand when he engaged in the movement of merging science and engineering schools among students. Zhang Wei exposed that Qian also made malicious attacks on the leaders of the Party Central Committee. Qian said: "The rectification campaign is not going well because the line from Liu Shaoqi to Peng Zhen does not advocate the rectification campaign." Zhang Wei questioned what Qian Weichang's intention was in saying these words and should make a thorough confession.

Rightist elements did not anticipate that senior intellectuals, after several years of education, had already parted ways with them.

Jian Bozan said that many rightist elements now say that they were "used" and "dragged into the water." He believes that Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang cannot be said to have been used. They played an active role in proposing this reactionary scientific program. He said that this scientific program is actually the vanguard battle for the rightist elements to attack the Party and socialism. The rightist elements believe that senior intellectuals are all "Adou" (a metaphor for someone incompetent) and think that they can open a gap here and establish a base. They not only set their sights on older scientists, but also on the second generation, making long-term plans, creating a "free market," wooing the masses, and organizing forces. They believe that this has hit the Communist Party's vitals. Jian Bozan said that the rightist elements did not anticipate that senior intellectuals, after several years of education, had already parted ways with them. They underestimated us. He said that we can still make suggestions and discuss issues such as scientific research time and materials. It is inevitable that the suggestions will be biased and rushed, and that the statements will be somewhat fiery, but we want to do a good job, not like the rightist elements who want to overthrow the Communist Party and oppose Marxism. Making suggestions with good intentions is accidental fire, while the rightists are intentionally setting fire. He said that senior intellectuals will never be used by them and will definitely defeat the rightist elements.

An important lesson from the anti-rightist struggle is that scientists must rely on the Party's leadership.

Feng Depi said that in this anti-rightist struggle, he learned an important lesson, which is that scientists must rely on the Party's leadership. Ideological remolding is a long-term task, but the issue of stance must be resolved first. Our country's scientific undertakings have achieved major development in a wide range and on an unprecedented scale in recent years. There are also some problems in the work, such as time, equipment, materials, and cadre issues. We want to discuss and resolve them, but we must see what position we take to treat these problems. The rightist elements have made them sound like a mess. Feng Depi said that the issue of scientists' time for research work must not only consider today's time, but also tomorrow's time. Before liberation, scientists did not know what would happen tomorrow and lived one day at a time. It was fundamentally impossible to make a three-year or five-year plan. Now there are complete conditions to make a five-year or ten-year plan, and even if a scientist dies, his career can be expected to continue. The time issue for general researchers has been resolved, and the leaders are also studying and resolving the time issue for a small number of scientists who hold leadership positions. The same is true for other equipment and material issues. The rightist elements actually proposed the slogan of "protecting scientists." What is this? Even if measured by the moral standards of the old society, it is dishonest and unconscionable and cannot be justified.

Chen Wangdao, Hou Debang, Fu Ying, Chen Jianguo, Shi Zhiren, Zheng Dian, and others also spoke at the meeting today. They were all dissatisfied with Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang's confessions at the last symposium. Hou Debang said that the Party is not satisfied with the great achievements made in the past eight years. In order to overcome the shortcomings in the work, the Party launched a rectification campaign and asked non-Party members to make suggestions to help the rectification campaign. However, some people took the opportunity to muddy the waters, slander the Party, and attempt to make the Party lose its prestige among the people and replace it. This is such a serious crime. Fu Ying said that the leadership of various schools is actively trying to solve the problem of scientists' working conditions, but the rightist elements want to take the lead in coming up with an anti-socialist scientific program. Is this not to make scientists across the country mistakenly believe that the China Democratic League spoke for them before the leadership solved the problem of scientists' working conditions? This is not just Zeng Zhaolun's confessed idea of "competing with the Communist Party," but the rightists want to lead science. Chen Wangdao said that the procedure for formulating the anti-socialist scientific program is a fraud. The process of formulating this program is sneaky. The reporting on the formulation process is not open and aboveboard. Only five people participated in the formulation of this document. Including Fei Xiaotong, who later revised the manuscript, and a cadre who drafted it at the beginning, there were only seven people in total. However, when Guangming Daily published the news and commentary, it said that it had widely solicited the opinions of league members.

Zheng Zhenduo, Luo Ergang, and Lu Xueshan, who did not attend due to poor health, all submitted written statements. Qian Jiaju criticizes his own erroneous thoughts, believing that the anti-rightist struggle is the most profound class education in his life.

Qian Jiaju made a self-criticism at the meeting today, entitled "Accepting Painful Lessons and Conducting a Deep Examination of Myself." He admitted that he bears a certain political responsibility for proposing this anti-socialist scientific program. He said that this anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific program is the first shot fired by the Zhang-Luo alliance to attack the Party in politics; ideologically, it is a question of who will defeat whom between the capitalist ideological system and the socialist ideological system. He said, "I am a researcher of social sciences and have always studied Marxist political economy. How could I be politically paralyzed to such an incurable degree? The only reason that can be explained is that in the depths of my mind, there are anti-Party and anti-socialist things that are connected to this reactionary program, which can resonate with this reactionary program, and it is not just 'peaceful coexistence.'" He said that the reactionary arguments in the reactionary program are in sync with a speech I made at a conference of members of the academic departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the end of April this year. First, in my speech at the conference of academic departments, I advocated that cultivating the younger generation of scientists should involve a bit of a "free market" as a supplement to the socialist unified allocation. I advocated that the personnel allocation of research work cadres should be determined by the scientists who guide the research, not by the personnel department. I opposed the personnel department's "unified" control over scientific research workers in the past and advocated opening up a "free market" for scientific research workers. Isn't this the source of the so-called equal treatment of cadres in the reactionary program? Having a bit of a "free market" means denying the necessity of the state's planned allocation of manpower for scientific research, which is against centralized democracy. The development of this kind of thinking leads to a state of anarchy, which is to advocate absolute "freedom" without leadership. Second, in my speech at the conference of academic departments, I proposed that "some people can only regard the leadership's speeches or government policies and measures as objective economic laws, and they consider it to be the best of research to find some materials to cite or promote." "Of course, the government is very cautious in formulating policies and guidelines, and they are basically based on objective conditions. However, it is also impossible to imagine that the government's economic policies or economic measures are completely in line with the laws of objective things and are perfect at every stage and every link." This passage is the basis for the third paragraph of the reactionary program on social science issues. There is also a paragraph in my speech that says: "Some people say that today there are only three ways to do economic work: one is to move dogmas; the second is to study the history of economic thought or the economic history of the pre-liberation period; and the third is to study foreign economic issues." Here, although it reflects that some people have such a view, this view is obviously not in line with the facts. Third, the most serious mistake in the reactionary program is to propose that we must first change our attitude towards bourgeois social science and "restore" capitalist social science. This is a naked exposure of the typical capitalist restoration thought. This passage is Fei Xiaotong's masterpiece. The two sentences "should be restored" and "should be valued" were personally added by Fei Xiaotong. But in the depths of my mind, there is also a common foundation. I once said in my speech at the conference of academic departments: "For the social sciences of capitalist countries, we should not adopt a method of completely denying them and knocking them down with one blow. The social sciences of capitalist countries basically belong to the category of bourgeois ideology and serve the bourgeoisie. However, there are also some desirable aspects, such as if we can absorb them, criticize the wrong ones, and inherit the correct ones, we can promote Marxism-Leninism and enrich Marxism-Leninism. Unfortunately, in the past few years, some disciplines, as long as the Soviet Union did not have them, we completely denied them, thinking that they were useless, such as sociology, political science, psychology, law, etc. We have completely denied them all. This method of self-isolation is really very naive and ridiculous." Although this passage is different from Fei Xiaotong's in terms of wording and degree, it is the same in essence. This is truly the most prominent manifestation of my own bourgeois ideology. Social science is the science with the strongest class nature. The sociology, political science, and law of capitalist countries are completely ideological weapons that serve the bourgeoisie and consolidate the bourgeois dictatorship. We want to "restore" them. Isn't this covering up for the restoration of the bourgeoisie? Although I did not propose to "restore" them, advocating that they should not be completely denied is only fifty steps away from Fei Xiaotong's "restoration" theory. Fourth, I overestimated the progressiveness of old intellectuals after liberation. Although this point is not reflected in the reactionary program, I particularly exposed my erroneous view in my speech at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. I said: "For the old intellectuals in our country who studied bourgeois social science before liberation, we also underestimated their role and progressiveness... It is a completely metaphysical view, not a dialectical view, to regard old intellectuals as always being old intellectuals." I also expressed the same erroneous opinion at the symposium of various parties convened by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. Now it seems that the problem is not underestimating the intellectuals from the old society, but overestimating them. From this struggle against the anti-Party and anti-people rightist elements, aren't the vast majority of the rightist elements who have been exposed senior intellectuals? As for myself, I usually consider myself a progressive intellectual, but from this time as a member of the five-person group of the China Democratic League, I did not recognize the reactionary nature of such a major anti-Party and anti-people scientific program. Whether I am still a progressive intellectual is also a big question. This proves that the ideological remolding of intellectuals is a transformation that changes one's bones. Zhang and Luo have already targeted me as an object they want to hunt. "Zhengming" magazine agreed that I would edit it, and they recommended me to be a member of the Scientific Planning Committee of the State Council, proving that they are trying their best to win me over. He said that this incident has given me the most profound class education in my life. I want to take this incident as a lesson, further transform my own thoughts, study Marxism-Leninism, and completely abandon the bourgeois world outlook and establish the proletarian world outlook.

    坚决维护党对科学工作的领导权
    科学家揭穿曾昭抡钱伟长制订反动科学纲领的阴谋
    新华社16日讯　今天，科学家继续举行座谈会，批判资产阶级右派分子反社会主义的科学纲领，反击右派向科学领域的进攻。
    今天的座谈会由科学院副院长张劲夫主持，到会的科学家有十四位发了言，有三位作了书面发言。
    赵九章在发言中批判了反社会主义科学纲领中提出的“保护科学家”的口号，指出这完全是对党的诬蔑。他认为党是真正保护和爱护科学家的。知识分子会议以后，党作了不少措施来保证科学家的工作时间。他自己平时已能以六分之四或六分之五的时间来进行研究工作。他说，由于党支持科学研究工作，中国科学家的工作条件已大为改善，以气象为例，抗战期间要用中国的资料作气象研究是根本不可能的。解放八年来，我国的气象观测台、站已经由解放初期的不到一百台发展到现在的一千三百七十七台，高空气象台由过去的几台发展到现在的七十台。赵九章说，他最近在日本时，美国代表对我国气象研究工作的发展表示惊讶。
    他质问曾昭抡所谓大学和研究所矛盾很大，是人为的挑拨还是客观的事实？他以地球物理研究所为例，说明这个研究机构不仅支援了产业部门（地质部、气象局），并且和北京大学、武汉大学、北京地质勘探学院进行广泛的合作，这几个学校的一些专业就是研究所协助之下搞起来的，彼此间并无矛盾。
    钱伟长曾昭抡是科学界的野心家  他们的作法同章罗联盟是一致的
    钱学森在会上驳斥了右派分子的科学研究要完全自由，不要计划不要组织的说法。钱学森说，现在已经不是科学研究的手工业时代，科学研究必须要有计划地进行。如果说不要计划能进行现代科学研究，那完全是不可能的。钱学森指出，钱伟长的反党反社会主义言行不是偶然的。钱学森说，钱伟长对自己所犯的罪行还没有很好认识。钱伟长说要把清华大学办成像加里福尼亚理工学院（前误为马萨诸塞理工学院），好像并没有什么，但他传播这个资本主义学校制度，并在全国范围内活动，却是一种对人民对党的反叛行为。钱学森并揭发钱伟长一贯耍两面派的手法。他一方面在科学院力学研究所的学术委员会上赞成力学研究所第二个五年计划，还说这个计划“劲头小”，“作得不够”；一方面又在清华大学说这个计划不行，“一定会碰得头破血流，非垮台不可”，言下大有在清华重搞一套之意。钱学森说，钱伟长完全是一个说谎话耍政治手腕的人，没有一点科学家的味道，是最恶劣和狠毒的政治野心家。
    杨石先说，曾昭抡成为罗隆基小集团的重要人物是由来已久（在抗战初期）的。杨石先指出，曾昭抡不仅是想“与共产党分庭抗礼”，而是要取而代之。他不是说“外行不能领导内行”吗。在去年制订十二年科学远景规划时，曾昭抡身为科学规划委员会委员，有意见不在会上正式提出，而要钱伟长先摸摸底，制造一个反对方案，企图用民盟和几万高级知识分子的帽子来压迫科学规划委员会的领导并企图在知识分子中争取一些群众。这种作法和他们对整个国家局势的估计是一致的，和章罗联盟的全部行动是一致的。曾昭抡说这个小组是临时偶然提出的，是被章罗所利用了，完全是蒙混大家的花言巧语，必须予以揭穿。杨石先还代表叶企孙、黄子卿、恽子强、柳大纲、华罗庚等揭发钱伟长在科学院第二次学部委员全体会议期间，曾提出一个挑拨性的提案，并怂恿几个学部委员签了名，这个提案没有经过讨论就送出。他质问钱伟长：你在这个提案里提出“目前高等学校内还有反对科学研究，尤其对科学研究散布着不公平的攻击”，建议学部大会“公开批评”，这是在想干什么？你不只一次对我说：学部组织工作做得不好，你所想作的组织工作就是这样的组织工作吗？
    张光斗说，钱恶毒地攻击党所规定的科学体制，说成是“本位主义”的根源，“在单位与单位之间逐渐形成一堵墙”。实质上是钱不喜欢这样的科学体制，是攻击党的领导。钱提出把研究工作去“就人”，张光斗说，如果科学研究工作去“就人”，就会使力量分散，研究工作的内容也将随着人的兴趣、专长而定，既没有组织，又没有计划。这种资产阶级的科学工作路线是不能满足社会主义建设需要的。
    右派主张以资产阶级的科学路线代替社会主义的科学路线，取消党的领导
    他说，钱在“争鸣”月刊上说，我国没有一个机构能够把科学院、高等学校、企业部门的研究工作统一管起来。科学规划委员会只管计划，不管经费，不管条件。科学院的学部只管科学院的工作。这些话实质上是反对科学规划委员会的总领导，反对科学院的学术领导，更基本的是反对党的领导。张光斗指出，钱在高等学校中，也有一套攻击党的领导的主张。他提出资产阶级的教学路线，和党所提出的社会主义教学路线相对抗。他提出“教授治校”、要成立“教授会”、把“人权下放”、“经费权下放”、“教学权下放”等等，“党委会负责管事务”和所谓“思想工作”。他还提出“公开办党”，“党务由群众参加”，这是明明白白地要取消党的领导。
    黄子卿说，他和曾昭抡认识三十多年，青年时代就是同学。他了解曾的为人是一贯地好抓权和弄权，对人不对事，以个人爱憎为标准。曾昭抡把持化学会二十多年，从化学会成立到1952年一直是化学会的主要人物。我国化学界不团结的症结主要是由于曾的把头作风。曾在化学会排斥异己，把一些名望很高的化学家排斥在化学会之外。化学会所办的刊物化学会会志（即今日化学学报），一直抓在他一个人的手里，编辑委员完全由他一人决定，发表文章也由他一人决定。一直到1952年，北京开化学会代表大会时，根据群众意见改选化学会，才改变了曾的把持局面。以后，化学学报才真正走上轨道。黄子卿还举了几个例子说明曾是弄权的典型。他说1956年化学会开会，代表都由曾提名，曾把代表分为三类：特邀代表、普通代表和列席代表。当时，傅鹰教授在胶体化学方面是全国闻名的，却连个列席代表的资格都没有，原因是曾不喜欢傅在特邀代表的名单中，却有一个1948年才毕业的助教。解放初期，科学院要搞化学名词。曾当时是化学会会长，科学院让他提名。曾当时提的差不多都是有机化学家，却没有无机化学、分析化学等方面的科学家。这样搞出来的化学名词当然不合用，不能令人满意。后来在化学界的批评下，曾昭抡不得已又成立了一个名词研究委员会，扩大到一百多人，故意分散力量，使它根本不能起作用。
    张维指出，曾昭抡、钱伟长把反社会主义科学纲领的制订说成是短时期内偶然的事情，这是和事实不符合的。他认为他们的活动就是
  “策划于密室，点火于基层”。他说，民盟“科学规划问题”临时研究组成立于5月13日，但是从曾昭抡交代过的事实说明，曾远在去年8月北戴河时，就和章、罗交换过关于科学体制问题的意见，在一封民盟给科学规划委员会的信中也说明他们在四、五月间已经对科学体制问题在各地盟员中征求过意见。这封信集中地说明了他们的阴谋活动，不是一朝一夕的事情。张维说，章伯钧在交代中提到6月5日曾昭抡、钱伟长、费孝通曾去找过他。张维质问曾、钱在章的密室中除了策划这个反社会主义科学纲领外，还策划了些什么？张维还揭露钱伟长到处点火的事实。6月6日是钱最忙的一天，在参加过章伯钧召集的紧急会议回到清华大学以后，下午三点到五点和学生座谈清华大学的校长选举问题，五点到六点又有学生访问他。钱当时的情绪给学生的印象是唯恐天下不乱。六点以后，钱又去看大字报。在校园里遇到一位平时不很熟悉的教师，钱热心地问他是否准备在“自由讲坛”上讲话，钱可以让学生去找他。张维说，他从1947年起和钱共事。他认为钱的反党言行并不是偶然的。他说，党对钱伟长一贯是信任和重视的，但是钱从刚解放时起就表面上表现进步，背后却极尽污蔑党的能事。院系调整时，钱和费孝通搞了一个“十院三十二系”的方案，和当时的教育部院系调整方案对抗。他说，钱是清华大学副校长，参加了学校里很多主要事务的研究，但他反说有职无权；而钱在学生中搞理工合校的运动，事先却没有和学校的任何一位领导人商量过。张维揭露钱还对党中央的负责人进行过恶意的攻击，钱说：“鸣放搞不好，因为刘少奇到彭真这一条线是不主张鸣放的。”张维质问钱伟长，说这些话的用意是什么，应该彻底交代。
    右派分子没有估计到，高级知识分子受了几年教育，已经同他们分了家
    翦伯赞说，现在许多右派分子都说“被利用了”，“被拉下水了”。他认为曾昭抡、钱伟长不能说是被利用的，他们在提出这个反动科学纲领上起了主动作用。他说，这个科学纲领，实际上是右派分子向党向社会主义进攻的前哨战。右派分子认为高级知识分子都是“阿斗”，以为可以在这里打开一个缺口，建立据点。他们不仅看上了年老的科学家，还看中了第二代，作长远打算，搞点“自由市场”，拉拢群众，组织力量。他们认为这一下打中了共产党的要害。翦伯赞说，右派分子没有估计到，高级知识分子受了几年教育，已经同他们分了家，他们把我们估计过低了。他说，科学研究的时间、资料等问题，我们还可以提意见讨论，提意见也不免偏急，讲得走了一点火，但我们是想搞好工作，不是像右派分子要搞垮共产党，要反掉马克思主义。动机好的提意见是走火无心，而右派却是放火有意。他说，高级知识分子决不被他们利用，一定要把右派打垮。
    反右派斗争的一个重要教训，就是科学家要依靠党的领导
    冯德培说在这次反右派斗争中，他得到一个重要教训，就是科学家要依靠党的领导。思想改造是一项长期的工作，但要首先解决立场问题。我们国家的科学事业几年来在广阔范围内和空前规模上获得重大发展，工作中也存在一些问题，例如时间、设备、资料、干部问题，我们是要讨论和解决的，但要看站在什么立场上对待这些问题，右派分子就把它们说的乌烟瘴气。冯德培说，关于科学家从事研究工作的时间问题，不仅要考虑今天的时间，还要考虑明天的时间。解放前科学家今天不知明天的事，作一天和尚撞一天钟，要作三年五年计划根本不可能。现在完全有条件作五年十年计划，甚至一个科学家死了，还可以预计他的事业的继续。现在一般研究人员的时间问题已经解决，少数担任领导工作的科学家的时间问题，领导上也正在研究解决。其他设备资料问题也是如此。右派分子竟然提出“保护科学家”的口号，这是什么话，即使用旧社会的道德标准来衡量，也是不老实，不凭良心，是通不过的。
    今天在会上发言的，还有陈望道、侯德榜、傅鹰、陈建功、石志仁、郑奠等，他们一致不满意曾昭抡、钱伟长在上次座谈会上的交代。侯德榜说，党对八年来取得的伟大成就并不满足，为了克服工作中的缺点，开展整风，请党外人士提意见帮助整风，而有些人竟乘机混水摸鱼，诬蔑党，企图使党在人民中失去威望，取而代之。这是何等重大的罪行。傅鹰说，各校领导方面都在积极设法解决科学家的工作条件问题，但右派分子要抢先一步搞出一个反社会主义的科学纲领来，这是不是想让全国科学家误认为是民盟代他们说了话，领导上才解决科学家的工作条件的。这不仅仅是曾昭抡交代的“与共产党分庭抗礼”的思想，而是右派想要领导科学。陈望道说，从反社会主义科学纲领的制订程序来说是一个欺诈。这个纲领制订过程是鬼鬼祟祟的。对于制订过程的报道也不是光明正大的。这个文件的制订，参与其事的只有五个人，加上后来改稿的费孝通和最先起草的一个干部，也总共不过七个人。而光明日报发表消息和评论时却说已广泛征求了盟员的意见。
    郑振铎、罗尔纲和因身体不好未到会的陆学善都提出了书面发言。千家驹批判自己的错误思想，认为反右派斗争是生平最深刻的阶级教育
    千家驹今天在会上作了“接受惨痛教训，深刻检查自己”的检讨。他承认在提出这个反社会主义的科学纲领上负有一定的政治责任。他说，这一反党反社会主义的科学纲领，在政治上是章罗联盟向党进攻的第一炮；在思想上，这是资本主义思想体系和社会主义思想体系谁战胜谁的问题。他说，我是研究社会科学的，而且一向研究马克思主义政治经济学的，竟至于政治麻痹到这样不可救药的程度，可以解释的唯一理由就是在我思想深处有和这个反动纲领相通的反党、反社会主义的东西，可以和这个反动纲领起共鸣，还不止是“和平共处”而已。他说，反动纲领中的反动论点和我在今年4月底在中国科学院学部委员大会中的一次发言对照，可以看出它们是互相合拍的。第一，我在学部大会发言中主张培养年青一代的科学家要搞点“自由市场”，作为社会主义统一调配的补充。我主张对于研究工作干部的人事调配，应决定于指导研究的科学家，而不是决定于人事部门。我反对过去人事部门对科学研究工作者“统”的太死，主张开放科学研究工作者的“自由市场”。这不就是反动纲领中所谓培养干部一视同仁等论调的张本吗？搞点“自由市场”，这就是否定国家对科学研究工作有计划的调配人力的必要性，也就是反对集中的民主。这种思想发展下去，就是无政府状态，也就是主张无领导的绝对的“自由”。第二，我在学部大会发言中提出“有的人就只能以领导的发言或政府的政策措施当成客观的经济规律。找点材料来引证一下或宣扬一番，即算尽研究之能事。固然，政府制定政策方针是十分慎重的，基本上也是以客观情况做依据的。但亦不可能设想政府的经济政策或经济措施，在每一阶段每一环节都是完全附合客观事物发展规律，尽善尽美的。”这一段话就是反动纲领中所提出关于社会科学的问题第三段话的根据。我在发言中还有一段说：“有人说，今天做经济工作只有三条路，一搬弄教条；二研究经济思想史或解放前的经济史料；三研究外国经济问题。”这里，虽反映有的人有这样一种看法，但这样看法显然不符合事实的。第三，反动纲领中错误严重的就是提出首先要改变对待资产阶级社会科学的态度和“恢复”资本主义社会科学一段话，这是典型的资本主义复辟思想赤裸裸的暴露。这一段话虽然是费孝通的得意之笔，“应当恢复”和“应当重视”两句是费孝通亲笔加入的。但在我的思想深处也是有共同的基础的，我在学部大会发言中曾经说：“对于资本主义国家的社会科学，不要采取一律否定，一棍子打死的办法。资本主义国家的社会科学，基本上属于资产阶级思想范畴，为资产阶级服务的，但是其中，也不无可取的地方，如能加以吸收，错误的加以批判，正确部分加以继承，即可发扬马列主义，丰富马列主义。不幸过去几年，有些学科，只要苏联所没有的，我们就一律否定，认为一无是处，如社会学、政治学、心理学、法律学等等都全部加以否定，这种故步自封的办法，实在是十分幼稚可笑的。”这一段话虽然与费孝通的有辞句上程度上的不同，本质上却是一样的。这真是我自己资产阶级思想最突出的表现。社会科学是阶级性最强的科学，资本主义国家的社会学、政治学、法律学是完全为资产阶级服务，巩固资产阶级专政的思想武器，我们要加以“恢复”，这不是为资产阶级复辟打掩护是什么呢？我虽然没有提出要“恢复”的话，但主张不要全部加以否定，这和费孝通的“恢复”论也不过五十步百步之差而已。第四，我把解放后旧知识分子的进步性估价过高，这一点虽然没有在反动纲领中反映出来，但我在科学院发言中却特别暴露了我这一错误观点。我说：“对于我国解放前学习资产阶级社会科学的旧知识分子，我们也是对他们的作用和进步估计不足的……把旧知识分子看成永远是旧知识分子，这是十足的形而上学的观点，不是辩证法的看法。”在中共中央统战部召开的各党派座谈会上也发表了同样的错误意见。现在看来，对旧社会来的知识分子不是估计过低而是估计过高的问题。从这次对右派分子反党、反人民的斗争中，暴露出来的右派分子绝大多数不是高级知识分子吗？以自己来说，我平时是以进步的知识分子自居的，但从这次作为民盟五人小组的一成员，竟不认识这样重大的反党反人民的科学纲领的反动性质，我是否还是一个进步的知识分子，也就大成问题了。这证明知识分子的思想改造是一种脱胎换骨的改造。章、罗已经把我作为他们所要猎取的一个对象。“争鸣”月刊同意由我来编，他们又推荐我做国务院科学规划委员会的委员，证明他们正在千方百计地争取我。他说，这一事件给了我生平一次最深刻的阶级教育。我要以这件事件为教训，进一步改造自己的思想，学习马列主义，彻底抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的世界观。
