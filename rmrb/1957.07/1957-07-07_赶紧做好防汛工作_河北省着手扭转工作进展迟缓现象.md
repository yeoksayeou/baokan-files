Speed Up Flood Control Work
Hebei Province Starts to Reverse Slow Progress

(Our correspondent, Lu Sheng, reports from Baoding on the 6th) The issue of rapidly implementing flood control work and preparing to overcome floods at any time has been placed before the party and government leading organs and the people of Hebei Province.

According to materials from the Water Conservancy Department: of the province's twenty-nine water conservancy basic construction projects this year, twenty are flood prevention and drainage projects. Because the tasks for these projects were determined relatively late, and the design and review work couldn't keep up, the projects originally planned to be completed in the first half of the year only started in May. As a result, most major projects will be delayed until the flood season to be constructed, which will increase the difficulty of construction. Currently, because it is the busy farming season, and also busy with locust extermination, some projects are delayed again and again due to labor shortages and cannot be constructed. The flood control project in Handan City requires 970,000 cubic meters of earthwork to be completed before heavy rains, but construction only started in mid-June. If it is delayed until the end of July to complete, it will require an additional 7,000 laborers. According to statistics on June 20: the quality of the seven pre-flood partial projects and the five basic completed earthwork projects in the province are generally good, but some projects only focused on catching up with the progress and affected the quality of the project. For example, the Zhanghe North Dam in Handan was found to have many leaks after a test of 30 millimeters of rain on June 9 due to improper compaction.

In terms of flood control work, since the provincial flood control meeting in early June, various localities have successively established flood control organizations and have begun various flood control preparations. According to incomplete statistics from the five special districts of Tongxian, Baoding, Tangshan, Handan, and Tianjin: more than 13 million jin of straw material, more than 23,000 jin of stones, more than 1.3 million bricks and more than 10,000 wooden beams, 360,000 sacks, and 36,000 pieces of matting have been transported to the embankment sections. The main problems currently are: the progress of flood control preparations is very slow, the rescue teams in many areas have not been organized well, and the materials are not sufficiently prepared. Therefore, if a flood occurs, they will be passively defending and even suffer unnecessary losses. The incident of the breach of the Fuyang River in Pingxiang and Ren counties a few days ago is an example. Some cadres and masses also have a paralyzing thought, they believe that they have done a lot of flood control and drainage projects this year, and the dikes are built higher and larger, so it doesn't matter if there is a big flood, and even think that big floods will not occur year after year.

In order to quickly prepare for flood control and lay a material foundation for overcoming floods, the Hebei Provincial People's Committee issued instructions to the special commissioners, municipal and county, and autonomous county people's committees on June 29, emphasizing that all localities should accept the lessons of the Pingxiang and Ren counties due to carelessness and insufficient preparation work which caused the breach of the Fuyang River, and immediately conduct a serious inspection of the preparation work of flood control projects, materials, and human resources organization. The dikes with poor quality should be repaired and reinforced; the irrigation outlets, culverts, and entrance roads on the dikes should be immediately blocked, and those that have been blocked should also be inspected to ensure the safety of the dike body. The instructions put forward different tasks and work for the riverine areas, plain areas, mountainous areas, and coastal areas with different flood control tasks; for the unfinished water conservancy basic construction projects, the instructions require all localities to distinguish the priorities of the projects, deal with them separately, those that can be completed should be completed within a time limit, and those that cannot be completed should concentrate efforts to complete the main projects or the main items in the projects, and do a good job in the safety protection of the construction site for the projects that span the flood season.

### 赶紧做好防汛工作  河北省着手扭转工作进展迟缓现象

    赶紧做好防汛工作
    河北省着手扭转工作进展迟缓现象
    本报保定6日电　记者鲁生报道：迅速做好防汛工作，准备随时战胜洪水的问题，已经摆在河北省党政领导机关和全省人民的面前。
    据水利厅材料：全省今年的二十九项水利基本建设中有二十项防洪排水工程。由于这些工程的任务确定的较晚，加上设计和审核工作赶不上去，结果原计划上半年完成的工程在5月份才开工，因此大部分主要工程将拖到汛期才可施工，这就要增加施工的困难。目前由于正值农忙季节，又加上忙于灭蝗，有些工程因劳力紧张一拖再拖，不能施工。邯郸市防洪工程需在大雨前完成的土方工程就有九十七万公方，但是6月中旬才开工，若延至7月底完工，还需增加七千民工。根据6月20日统计：全省已经完工的七项汛前部分工程和基本完工的五项土方工程的质量，一般都是好的，但是也有部分工程只注意了赶进度，影响了工程质量。如邯郸漳河北大堤由于夯打不实，经6月9日三十公厘雨的一次考验，就发现了很多漏洞。
    在防汛工作方面，从6月上旬省防汛会议以来，各地都已先后建立了防汛组织，并且已经开始进行各项防汛准备工作。据通县、保定、唐山、邯郸、天津五个专区不完全统计：已经把一千三百多万斤的秸草料，两万三千多斤的石头，一百三十多万块砖和一万多棵木梁，三十六万条麻袋，三万六千片席子都运到了堤段。目前存在的主要问题是：防汛准备工作进展很迟缓，许多地区的抢险队还没组织好，物料也准备的不充分，因此一遇洪水就会被动招架，甚至遭到不应有的损失。前些天滏阳河平乡、任县决口的事件就是例子。还有些地区的干部和群众存有麻痹思想，他们认为今年已经做了很多防汛防涝工程，堤防修的又高又大，来大水没关系，甚至认为大水不会连年闹。
    为了迅速做好防汛准备，给战胜洪水打下物质基础，河北省人民委员会特于6月29日向各专署市县以及自治县人民委员会发出指示，强调指出各地应接受平乡、任县由于麻痹大意、准备工作不足而造成滏阳河决口事件的教训，立即对防汛工程、物料、人力组织等准备工作认真地进行一次检查。对质量不好的堤段要进行修整加固；对堤上的浇地沽口、涵洞、口道要立即堵闭，已经堵闭的也要经过检查以确保堤身安全。指示中对防汛任务不同的沿河地区、平原地区、山区、滨海区都提出了不同的任务和工作；对于未完成的水利基本建设工程，指示要求各地分清工程的轻重缓急，分别处理，能完成的要限期完成，不能完成的要集中力量完成主要工程或工程中的主要项目，对跨越汛期的工程，要作好工地安全保护工作。
