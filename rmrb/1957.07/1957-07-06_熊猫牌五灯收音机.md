Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 5th: The new 1957 Panda brand five-tube AC broadcast radio is the latest design trial-produced by the state-owned Nanjing Radio Factory, absorbing the advantages of many famous foreign radios. The shape of this radio is slightly larger than the currently produced Red Star brand radio. The coffee-colored case is matched with a gracefully curved milky white panel and two symmetrical double knobs, making the style beautiful and elegant. The radio's circuit design and main parts have been greatly improved, and the parts are installed on a movable base plate, making disassembly and repair convenient. This year, it is planned to produce one thousand of this model of radio.
  The Panda brand radio is the fifth type of radio produced by the Nanjing Radio Factory. Before liberation, this factory was an assembly plant relying on imported radio parts. After liberation, it has been expanded year by year and has become the largest radio manufacturer in China.

    熊猫牌五灯收音机
    据新华社南京5日电　1957年新型的熊猫牌五灯交流广播收音机，是国营南京无线电厂吸收了外国许多名牌收音机的优点，在最近设计试制成功的。这种收音机的外型比目前生产的红星牌收音机稍大一点，咖啡色的外壳配上曲线柔美的乳白色面板和两个对称的双套旋钮，式样美丽大方。收音机的线路设计和主要零件有很大改进，机件装置在活动的底板上，拆修方便。今年计划生产这个型号的收音机一千部。
  熊猫牌收音机是南京无线电厂生产的第五种收音机。这个厂解放前是一个依靠国外进口收音机零件的装配工厂，解放后连年扩建，已经成为我国收音机产量最大的制造厂。
