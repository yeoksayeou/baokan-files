The Zhang-Luo Alliance is Insidious and Ferocious
Democratic League Symposium Exposes Their Wild Ambitions to Dominate the Democratic League, Control the Cultural and Educational Circles, and Overthrow Socialism

(Our Dispatch) The second rectification symposium of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League continued on the evening of June 30. Luo Longji made every effort to quibble about his mistakes at the afternoon symposium. At the beginning of the evening session, everyone indignantly exposed and criticized Luo Longji's mistakes and his dishonest confession. Some of the people who spoke at this meeting had relatively close relationships with Luo Longji, but they did not reveal many facts.

Gao Chongmin was the first to speak at the evening meeting. He first criticized Luo Longji's attitude in his afternoon speech. He said: Luo Longji's speech was not an explanation, but merely a defense of the materials exposed in the newspapers and by his comrades. He expressed not only dissatisfaction but even indignation at this speech. Gao Chongmin also said: Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji are both good at playing two-faced tricks. They appear to support the leadership of the Communist Party on the surface, but secretly plot against it. They often said, "Which thing can we make the decision on? Not only can we not make the decision, but we can't even say a word more." Zhang Bojun said, "I, as a minister, am just guarding the spirit tablet." Luo Longji said, "I can do diplomatic work, but they (referring to the Communist Party) asked me to manage wood." After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, especially after the Polish and Hungarian events, these two ambitious men, Zhang and Luo, believed that the time had come. Therefore, they believed that socialist democracy should surpass capitalist democracy. The president of a capitalist country serves a term of three or four years, but how many years did Stalin serve? And how many years will Chairman Mao serve?

Gao Chongmin pointed out: Zhang and Luo were originally fighting each other, but recently they have united. Since the Democratic League's work conference this year, many major matters within the League have been decided solely by Zhang and Luo. They planned to squeeze out Chairman Shen Junru and ask Shen Junru to retire as the honorary chairman of the Democratic League, and then have Zhang Bojun serve as chairman and Luo Longji as executive vice chairman. They also planned to squeeze out all the progressive elements in the League. Zhang and Luo, with one hand, attacked progressive elements, and with the other hand, tried their best to win over right-wing elements, first arranging some people from their small organizations in the League's departments to control the cultural and educational circles. Zhang Bojun knew that Luo Longji had close relationships with so-called great intellectuals. He wanted to cooperate with Luo Longji because Luo had the capital of great intellectuals. Zhang Bojun believed that he was politically experienced. The two of them cooperated to create conditions to overthrow the Party's leadership and replace it. Gao Chongmin said that Zhang and Luo never reported their work to Shen Junru, and many major matters were not discussed with Shi Liang and me. They handled everything themselves and, in the name of the Central Committee of the League, established four groups, namely, the group for abolishing the Party committee system in universities, the group for long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, the group for scientific planning, and the group for having positions without power. In addition, they also placed their confidants in propaganda organs to provoke relations between the Party and the masses and instigate anti-communism. For example, Pu Xixiu was placed in Wenhui Daily, and they also attempted to place Chen Xingui in Guangming Daily. They also predicted, "The world will definitely change within fifteen years." That is to say, they wanted to overthrow the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and overthrow socialism within fifteen years.

Zhang and Luo hated Marxism-Leninism even more, saying, "What Marxism-Leninism, it's all rigid minds. Marxism-Leninism is a kind of handicraft. Have Marx and Lenin ever seen atomic energy? Marxism-Leninism must also change." They were even more insulting to comrades who wanted to join the Party, saying, "Why be someone else's son, grandson, or disciple? The Party's circle is only ten million, and there is much to be done outside the circle. The people the Party trusts are not necessarily all good, and there are also good people the Party doesn't trust." "People who want to join the Party are all for political convenience, and after death, they will enter the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery," and so on.

After Gao Chongmin's speech, the speakers included Guo Zechen, Zeng Zhaolun, Ye Duyi, Pan Dakui, Standing Committee Members of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, Zhang Guofan, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Democratic League, Xu Zhucheng, Editor-in-Chief of Shanghai Wenhui Daily, Pu Xixiu, Deputy Editor-in-Chief, and Zhang Jian, a member of the Democratic League. In addition, Fei Xiaotong, Ma Zhemin, Standing Committee Members of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, as well as Zhang Zhihe, Luo Hanxian, Zhang Yunchuan, Wen Jiasi, Yang Ziheng, and Qiao Chuanjue, made written statements.

Guo Zechen said: Luo Longji said that he was satisfied after becoming a minister. In my opinion, such a person's ambition is not to be a minister, but to take advantage of the loopholes in socialism to carry out anti-communist conspiracies. After he became a minister, he advocated that the selection of students to study in the Soviet Union should not be based on political standards. When the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference wanted to establish a reception group for foreign guests, Luo Longji insisted on having this group assigned to him to lead. Luo Longji also requested the establishment of an intellectual committee in the CPPCC. What is the motive, what is the purpose, Luo Longji needs to be examined.

Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun formed an alliance within the League. Luo often said, "I am not as good as Zhang Bojun in talking about Marxism-Leninism, and Zhang Bojun is not as good as me in talking about the UK and the US." He also said, "Wherever Zhang Bojun goes, I will follow." Why do Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun cooperate so well? Obviously, they are politically consistent. In the past, it was said that there were differences between the two, but that was only because they were inconsistent in the struggle for power and profit. Opposition to the Communist Party was also consistent in the past.

Zeng Zhaolun said: In the early days of liberation, Luo Longji wrote a letter to Zhao Wenbi in Shanghai, and one sentence in the letter was, "Organization against organization." What does this sentence mean? In addition, Luo Longji told me two or three times that he hoped to put Pan Dakui in the position of President of Chongqing University. This matter shows that he consciously wanted to seize the leadership of universities. Zeng Zhaolun said: Luo Longji said that he only engaged in sectarianism in Beijing and had no contact with other places. This is not true. I know that in the period of 1950-1951, he had contact with Wang Zhiguang in Taiyuan, Du Maizhi in Changsha, etc. At that time, Peng Wenyin and Chen Renbing always went to see him whenever they came from Shanghai.

    章罗联盟阴险凶狠
    民盟座谈会揭露他们妄想独霸民盟、控制文教界、反掉社会主义
    本报讯　民盟中央第二次整风座谈会在6月30日晚上继续进行。罗隆基在下午的座谈会上对他自己的错误百般进行狡辩。晚上的会议一开始，大家就愤慨地对罗隆基的错误以及他的不老实的交代进行揭发和批判。在这次会议上发言的有些人和罗隆基的关系是比较密切的，但是，他们并没有揭发出很多事实。
    高崇民是在晚上的会议上第一个发言。他首先批判了罗隆基在下午的会议上发言的态度。他说：罗隆基的发言并不是交代，只是对报纸上及同志们所揭发的材料进行辩解。他表示对这个发言不仅不满意，甚至是愤慨。高崇民还说：章伯钧、罗隆基都是善于玩弄两面手法，他们表面上拥护共产党的领导，但背地里又阴谋反对共产党的领导。他们常说：“哪一件事是我们可以做了主的？不但做不了主，连话都不能多说一句。”章伯钧说：“我这个部长就是守灵牌。”罗隆基说：“我可以做外交工作，但是人家（指共产党）叫我去管木头。”在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，特别是波兰、匈牙利事件以后，章、罗这两个野心家就认为时机已到，于是他们认为：社会主义民主应当超过资本主义民主才是，资本主义国家的总统三、四年一任，而斯大林做了多少年？毛主席又不知要做多少年？
    高崇民指出：章、罗两人本来是钩心斗角的，但是近来联合起来了。从今年民盟工作会议以后，盟内许多重大事情，都由章、罗两人独断专行，他们计划排挤沈钧儒主席，叫沈钧儒退居民盟的名誉主席，然后由章伯钧担任主席，由罗隆基担任常务副主席。他们并计划将盟内的进步分子全部排挤出去。章、罗二人一只手打击进步分子，一只手则尽量拉拢右派分子，首先把他们的小组织中间的一些人，安排在盟的各部会，控制文教界。章伯钧知道，罗隆基和所谓大知识分子关系密切，他要和罗隆基合作，就因为罗有大知识分子的本钱。章伯钧自认为自己在政治上有经验，两人合作，就能创造条件，推翻党的领导，他们起而代之。高崇民说，章、罗两人做的事情，从来不向沈钧儒做工作报告，许多重大的事情也不同史良和我商量。他们两人包办，用盟中央的名义，成立了四个小组，即取消高等学校党委制小组，长期共存、互相监督小组，科学规划小组，有职无权小组。另外，他们还将他们的心腹安插在言论机关，以便挑拨党群关系，煽动反共。例如把浦熙修安插到文汇报，又企图把陈新桂安插到光明日报中去，他们还预言说：“十五年内世界一定要变。”就是说，他们要在十五年内反掉中国共产党的领导，反掉社会主义。
    章、罗二人更仇恨马列主义，说：“什么马列主义，都是刻板的脑筋。马列主义是一种手工业，马克思、列宁见过原子能吗？马列主义也是要变的。”对于要求入党的同志则更加侮蔑，他们说：“为什么要去做人家的儿子、孙子、徒子徒孙呢？党的圈子只有一千万，圈子外面还大有文章可做。党相信的人未见得都好，党不相信的人也有好的”“想入党的人都是为了政治上便利，死后进八宝山”等等。
    在高崇民发言后，发言的有民盟中央常务委员郭则沉、曾昭抡、叶笃义、潘大逵，民盟天津市委主任委员张国藩，上海文汇报总编辑徐铸成、副总编辑浦熙修和民盟成员张健。此外，民盟中央常务委员费孝通、马哲民，以及张志和、罗涵先、张云川、闻家驷、杨子恒、乔传珏作了书面发言。
    郭则沉说：罗隆基说，当了部长之后，满意了。我看：这样的人其志不在部长，是想钻社会主义的空子，进行反对共产党的阴谋活动。他当了部长以后，主张部里选派留苏学生不应以政治为标准。政协全国委员会要成立外宾接待组，罗隆基坚持要把这个组划归他来领导。罗隆基还要求在政协成立知识分子委员会。这是什么动机，什么目的，罗隆基要检查。
    罗隆基和章伯钧在盟内搞联盟。罗常讲：“谈马列主义我不如章伯钧，谈英美章伯钧不如我”。又说“章伯钧走到那里，我跟到那里”。罗隆基与章伯钧为什么合作得这样好，很显然，他们在政治上是一致的。过去说他们两人有分歧，那只是在争权夺利上不一致，反对共产党，这在过去也是一致的。
    曾昭抡说：解放初期，罗隆基曾写信给上海的赵文璧，信里有一句话是：“以组织对组织，”这句话是什么意思。另外，罗隆基有两、三次对我说，希望把潘大逵放在重庆大学校长的位子上。这件事表示他是有意识地要夺取高等学校的领导的。曾昭抡说：罗隆基说自己搞宗派，只是在北京联络了一批人和外地没有什么联系。这不是事实。我知道在1950——1951年那一段，他是与太原王之光、长沙杜迈之等是有联系的。那时候彭文应、陈仁炳每次从上海来也总是去看他。
