Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: The chief of staff of Spanish dictator Franco's office, Luis Carrero Blanco, announced in parliament on the 15th that if the sixty-four-year-old Franco dies or retires, Spain will restore the monarchy.

As the resistance against Franco's dictatorship within the country intensifies, and the contradictions between the Spanish Falange and the Royalists continue to expand, Franco is attempting to maintain his current rule by promising to restore the monarchy.

    独夫佛朗哥一旦毕命  西班牙王室将要复辟
    据新华社16日讯　西班牙独裁者佛朗哥的办公厅主任路易斯·布兰科15日在议会上宣布：如果六十四岁的佛朗哥死了或者退休了，西班牙将恢复君主制度。
    由于佛朗哥独裁政权在国内遭到的反抗日益强烈，西班牙长枪党和保皇党之间的矛盾在不断扩大，佛朗哥企图用同意恢复君主制度的诺言来维持目前的统治。
