Xinhua News Agency, June 6th: The Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held its fourteenth meeting this morning, discussing and adopting a decision to launch a rectification campaign within the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee organization, with the struggle against bourgeois right-wing elements as its main content.

At the meeting, Chu Xichun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, made a "Report on the Situation of the Struggle Against Rightists and the Party Rectification in the Central and Local Organizations of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee." Mei Gongbin, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, explained the rectification decision. The meeting discussed the decision in light of the current situation of the anti-rightist struggle within the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee organization.

Cheng Qian, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, and Zhu Xuefan, Standing Committee member, and more than twenty others spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their support for the decision and focused on discussing issues such as the handling of right-wing elements in the movement, the leadership of the rectification, and the content of the rectification.

The meeting passed the decision on the rectification of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee organization.

At today's meeting, Chu Xichun also read a letter from all the students of the Archives Research Class of the Renmin University of China to the Central Committee Group of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee. The letter stated that they were very angry after seeing Huang Shaohong's sinister face revealed in the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee Group of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, especially after seeing Huang Shaohong's statement that "students welcome Ge Peiqi because Ge Peiqi has a mass base among students." Huang Shaohong's statement is a slander against all the students of Renmin University of China. The recent signature campaign against Ge Peiqi's anti-socialist fallacies held in their school proves that, apart from a few right-wing elements like Lin Xiling, Huang Shaohong's admired protégé, no student is Ge Peiqi's mass base. The letter demanded that Huang Shaohong honestly confess to the people, otherwise he will isolate himself from the people and be abandoned by the people.

Then, Chu Xichun read a letter from the students of the Biology Department of Beijing Normal University to the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee. The letter stated that Beijing Normal University recently exposed Lu Huaibao and Xie Xin, two counter-revolutionary elements with conclusive evidence, in the anti-rightist struggle, and Lu and Xie are precisely two of the people on Huang Shaohong's list of "appeals" for counter-revolutionary elements. The letter demanded that the Central Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee thoroughly investigate all of Huang Shaohong's anti-people, anti-socialist, and anti-Party leadership activities; and demanded that Huang Shaohong thoroughly explain why he "appealed" for current counter-revolutionary elements such as Lu Huaibao and Xie Xin? What is the relationship between them?

    民革决定开展整风运动
    北京师范大学生物系学生要求民革中央
    彻底追查黄绍竑包庇反革命分子的活动
    据新华社6日讯　中国国民党革命委员会常务委员会今天上午举行第十四次会议，讨论并通过在民革组织内开展以反对资产阶级右派分子的斗争为主要内容的整风运动的决定。
    会上，民革中央副秘书长楚溪春作了“关于民革中央及地方组织对反击右派斗争及党内整风有关情况的报告”。民革中央秘书长梅龚彬就整风决定作了说明。会议联系当前民革组织内反右派斗争的情况，对这个决定进行了讨论。
    民革中央副主席程潜和常务委员朱学范等二十多人在会上发了言。他们一致表示拥护这个决定，并且着重就运动中对右派分子的处理问题、整风的领导问题、整风的内容问题等进行了讨论。
    会议通过了关于民革组织整风的决定。
    在今天的会议上，楚溪春还宣读了中国人民大学档案研究班全体学生写给民革中央小组的一封信。信上说，他们在报上看到民革中央小组扩大会议揭露的黄绍竑的阴谋嘴脸，尤其是看到黄绍竑说“学生欢迎葛佩琦，因为葛佩琦在学生中有群众”以后，非常气愤。黄绍竑这种说法，是对中国人民大学全体同学的诬蔑。从他们学校最近举行的一次反对葛佩琦反社会主义谬论的签名活动就证明，除了黄绍竑所钦佩的得意门生林希翎之类的几个右派分子以外，没有一个学生是葛佩琦的群众。这封信要求黄绍竑老老实实向人民交代，否则将自绝于人民，被人民抛弃。
    然后，楚溪春又宣读了北京师范大学生物系学生给民革中央的一封信。信中说，北京师范大学最近在反右派斗争中，揭露了鹿怀宝、谢昕两个罪证确凿的反革命分子，而鹿、谢正是黄绍竑为反革命分子“申冤”名单中的两个。这封信要求民革中央应彻底追查黄绍竑的一切反人民反社会主义反对党的领导的活动；要黄绍竑彻底交代为什么为现行反革命分子鹿怀宝、谢昕等申冤？他们之间有什么关系？
