The vast number of overseas Chinese are proud to have such a great socialist motherland
Huang Changshui's Speech

I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Chief Procurator Zhang, President Dong, Vice Chairman Peng, and Vice Premier Ulanhu.

From our distant ancestors to our generation, why did we run abroad and become overseas Chinese in foreign lands? The reason is very simple: it was the result of imperialist aggression in old China. What was our life like when we arrived abroad? For a long time, because most of our places of residence were under the direct and indirect control of imperialism, our compatriots were economically squeezed everywhere and politically oppressed and discriminated against. For many years, we have been helpless orphans overseas.

Modern overseas Chinese history is filled with the blood and tears of millions of overseas Chinese. Only the Communist Party has realized the long-cherished wish of overseas Chinese.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, overseas Chinese returning to China were always inevitably subjected to bullying by local feudal bosses and local bullies, threats from Kuomintang officials and party hacks, and various forms of exploitation. Going to the countryside also meant suffering from raids by bandits and kidnapping for ransom. At that time, in the overseas Chinese hometowns of southern Fujian, who dared to spend the night at home after returning? Especially after the end of World War II and before the total collapse of the Kuomintang, due to runaway inflation, a large amount of the hard-earned remittances of overseas Chinese went into the pockets of the four big families. At that time, many elderly overseas Chinese who were preparing to return home to retire remitted their life savings back, and when they arrived in their hometowns, they found that their life's hard work had turned into a pile of waste paper. In order to survive, they had to try their best, with tears in their eyes, to find a way to borrow travel expenses to return to their original place of residence and continue to work like horses and cattle. A history of modern overseas Chinese is filled with the sorrowful blood and tears of millions of overseas Chinese.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to their corruption and incompetence, they could not protect overseas Chinese abroad, and even poisoned them; domestically, the darkness of politics made it impossible for the relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese to survive in their hometowns, making overseas Chinese regard returning to the country as a dangerous path. Therefore, the vast number of overseas Chinese, like their compatriots at home, always hoped to change the status quo of old China as soon as possible, to destroy the Kuomintang's reactionary rule as soon as possible, to change China's long-standing weakness, and to hope that the motherland could be liberated and become strong as soon as possible. To be honest, from the painful experience of overseas Chinese over the years, that is, from their own vital interests, they are more eager to have a prosperous and strong motherland that can protect their legitimate rights and interests.

Since the Opium War, in the past century, many patriotic people with lofty ideals have stepped forward and shed their blood, seeking nothing more than to change China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial status, but they took the road of capitalism, and all failed. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, after thirty years of long-term arduous struggle, after the First and Second Revolutionary Civil Wars, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in old China was overthrown, realizing the long-cherished expectations of the people of the whole country, including millions of overseas Chinese, and realizing the great socialist New China. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. The vast number of overseas Chinese are proud to have such a great motherland.

After liberation, the motherland's political, economic, and cultural construction has made amazing progress.

In the seven years since liberation, millions of overseas Chinese have seen very clearly that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the motherland has made amazing progress in political, economic, cultural, and educational construction, completed the achievements that our ancestors could not complete for a hundred years, changed the long-standing bad social customs of old China, and improved the motherland's international status. Every year since liberation, many overseas Chinese have returned to China for sightseeing, giving overseas Chinese a general feeling that the motherland has completely changed. Compared with old China, our motherland has become so lovely. Overseas Chinese are the most realistic. When they set foot on the land of the motherland, what surprised them most was that in just a few years, the motherland had eliminated bandits, local feudal bosses, prostitutes, gambling, and opium. From the places they have been to, they have personally experienced great changes in social customs, and the motherland has achieved "no one picks up lost articles on the road, and doors are not locked at night." In terms of economic construction, the motherland's progress is even more rapid. Through the eyes of overseas Chinese themselves, they have seen that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the motherland has completed many great construction projects. Fujian, the hometown of overseas Chinese, not only has the best highway in the country, but also has the railway that the people of the whole province and overseas Chinese have longed for for many years - the Yingxia Railway. The Yangtze River Bridge, spanning the Yangtze River and involving a huge project, which they never dared to imagine in the past, has finally been built. From the Xinhai Revolution to the eve of national liberation, old China not only had no heavy industry to speak of, but also its light industry was very weak. Now we not only have our own manufactured cars, but also our own manufactured jet aircraft and many large-scale machine tools made with our own materials. The achievements we have made in economic construction in the past seven years are undeniable even by capitalist countries. The recent United Nations World Economic Report also acknowledges that China's industrial growth rate in 1956 ranked first in the world.

The People's Government has adopted various measures to protect the legitimate interests of overseas Chinese and their relatives.

The People's Government has always cared about the interests of overseas Chinese abroad and their relatives at home. In the early days of liberation, in order to prevent the relatives of overseas Chinese from being affected by price fluctuations, the state formulated measures for remittances and deposits in the original currency. After China's currency system stabilized and the currency systems of some countries depreciated, the state formulated measures for remittances in Renminbi to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and their relatives. In order to protect the interests of overseas Chinese and their relatives, in accordance with Article 11 of the Constitution, which stipulates that "the state protects the ownership of citizens' legitimate income, savings, houses, and various means of livelihood," the State Council issued an order on February 23, 1955, regarding the implementation of the policy of protecting overseas remittances, which enabled the vast number of overseas Chinese and their relatives to generally receive personal benefits. At the same time, it also enabled overseas Chinese and their relatives to invest overseas remittances in production or invest in state investment companies, as well as to protect and encourage the establishment of public welfare undertakings in their hometowns. The People's Government can also pay off the outstanding deposits of the old Kuomintang reactionary rule period's pre-liberation money shops, of which overseas Chinese and their relatives' deposits account for a considerable amount, making the beneficiaries feel overjoyed and feel like "the hungry get food, and the thirsty get drink," expressing infinite gratitude to the People's Government.

We realize that without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, it would not be possible to defeat the Kuomintang reactionary forces that poisoned the Chinese people for more than 20 years; without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, it would not be possible to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in old China and complete China's new democratic revolution; without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the motherland's construction undertakings in all aspects could not have progressed so rapidly today, and China's political prestige in the international arena could not have been raised like today. Facts tell us that only under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, taking the socialist road, is it possible for our motherland to achieve today's achievements in all aspects. No matter how imperialism and its running dogs, a small handful of counter-revolutionary elements at home and abroad, slander and hate the motherland, they cannot deny the iron-clad facts of the great construction achievements. The motherland, taking the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party, is growing stronger day by day.

Resolutely repel the attack of the right-wing elements and defend the fruits of the motherland's victory.

In order to strengthen the unity of the whole country, strengthen the unity within and outside the Party, correctly handle contradictions among the people, the Communist Party of China launched a rectification movement against bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism. Through this movement, the Marxist ideological level of the entire Party is improved, the work style is improved, to meet the needs of socialist transformation and socialist construction, which is beneficial to the country and the people. This further illustrates that our Party—the Communist Party of China—is great, and our system—the socialist system—is superior. The Communist Party of China is a party that serves the people. The Party is a symbol of the interests of the broadest masses of the people, and it is the beacon of the motherland's independence, prosperity, and democratic freedom. The current rectification movement also fully demonstrates that the Communist Party of China is a party that can continuously eliminate certain shortcomings and errors in its work through criticism and self-criticism and move forward. This fully explains why the Communist Party of China is the party trusted by the people of the whole country, including overseas Chinese. Every liberated Chinese person does not want to see his motherland become a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country again, and will never allow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism to be restored in China. We overseas Chinese and the people of the whole country firmly believe that the socialist road is the only road that the motherland should take.

However, in this rectification movement, right-wing elements with ulterior motives, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chen Xingu, and Chu Anping, have appeared, expressing hatred for the Communist Party and socialism in their words and actions. These right-wing elements with ulterior motives attempted to use the rectification to weaken the people's democratic dictatorship, oppose the leadership of the Party, oppose socialism, and undermine our socialist cause. As an overseas Chinese and a businessman, I especially want to expose Zhang Naiqi's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and actions. First of all, it should be said that a bourgeois element like me, who still needs to be vigorously transformed, is still sometimes inevitably deceived by Zhang Naiqi's "candied arsenic" due to class stand, viewpoint, and class feelings. If it were not for the Party's exposure of the right-wing elements this time, I would not have been able to see that this is a struggle between two lines. For example, at a symposium convened by the United Front Work Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, I talked about the issue of Party branches in small factories. I hoped that the Municipal Committee would consider whether Party branches should be established in some small factories that do not meet the conditions. This shows that my understanding of the Party's organizational system is very ignorant, and more seriously, it shows that ideologically, I do not rely on the Party's leadership enough. I must resolutely overcome and improve this, and step up self-education and self-transformation. Zhang Naiqi's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities fully and centrally reflect the negative side of the bourgeoisie's two-sided nature. It is a blatant propaganda of the restoration of capitalism, a reactionary political action, and uses all kinds of vicious and shameless means such as distortion, rumor-mongering, provocation, incitement, deception, and anesthetization to slander the Communist Party and socialism, attempting to stir up dissatisfaction among the industrial and commercial circles towards the Party and the government, in order to achieve their despicable, filthy, and unspeakable purposes. In order to safeguard the hard-won fruits of the motherland's revolution, to consolidate the motherland's socialist construction, and to express the trust of the people of the whole country, including overseas Chinese, in the leadership of the Party, we must resolutely draw a clear line with all right-wing elements, fight them to the end, and repel their rampant attacks. We must unite and resolutely advance under the leadership of the Communist Party of China forever, and always follow the Communist Party of China.

    广大华侨都以我们有这样一个伟大的社会主义祖国而自豪
    黄长水的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李副总理、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长、彭副委员长和乌兰夫副总理的报告。
    从我们的远祖到我们这一辈，为什么要往国外跑，到异国异乡去当华侨？道理很简单，那就是在旧中国由于帝国主义侵略的结果。我们到了国外，我们的生活又是怎样呢？长时期以来由于广大的侨居地都在帝国主义直接和间接的控制下，我们侨胞在经济上处处受到排挤，政治上受压迫、受歧视。多少年来我们一直是无依无靠的海外孤儿。
    近代华侨史充满了千百万侨胞的血泪，只有共产党才实现了侨胞多年的愿望
    在国民党反动统治时期，侨胞回国，总难免要受地方上各种封建把头、地方恶霸的欺凌，国民党官吏、党棍的威胁和多方的压榨。到乡下去还要遭受土匪强盗的洗劫、绑票勒赎。当时在闽南侨乡，华侨回来，谁敢在家里过夜？尤其是第二次世界大战结束以后和国民党总崩溃以前，由于恶性通货膨胀，多少华侨的血汗汇款都进了四大家族的腰包。当时有不少准备回家养老的老华侨，把毕生的积蓄汇回来，他们到了家乡才发现自己毕生的血汗变成了一堆废纸。他们为了活命，只好拼老命，含着眼泪再想办法借路费回原居留地去继续当马牛。一部近代华侨史是充满了千百万侨胞的辛酸血泪的。
    在国民党反动统治时期，由于他们的腐败无能，在国外既无法保护华侨，甚至毒害华侨；在国内同样因政治黑暗使侨乡的侨眷和归侨都无法生存，使侨胞视归国为畏途，所以广大的华侨和国内同胞一样，总是希望早日改变旧中国的现状，希望早日摧毁国民党的反动统治，希望能改变百年来中国积弱的面貌，希望祖国能早一点解放，早一天强盛起来。老实说，从华侨多少年来的惨痛经验，也就是从他们的切身利益出发，他们更加渴望有一个能够保护他们的正当权益、繁荣富强的祖国。
    自从鸦片战争以来，在过去百年中，多少爱国的仁人志士，前仆后继地抛头颅流鲜血，所求的无非是要改变中国半封建半殖民地的地位，但是他们走的是资本主义的道路，结果都失败了。只有在中国共产党领导下，经过了三十年长期的艰苦奋斗，经过了第一、二次国内革命战争、抗日战争和解放战争，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在旧中国的统治，才实现了包括千百万国外华侨在内的全国人民多年来的期望，实现了伟大的社会主义的新中国。没有共产党，便没有新中国。广大的国外华侨都以有这样一个伟大的祖国而自豪。
    解放后祖国的政治、经济、文化建设有了惊人的进步
    解放七年来，国外千百万的侨胞看得很清楚，祖国在共产党领导下，在政治、经济、文化教育各方面的建设有了惊人的进步，完成了百年来我们的先人所无法完成的功业，改变了长时期以来旧中国的不良的社会风气，提高了祖国在国际上的地位。解放后每年都有很多的华侨回国观光，给侨胞们一个总的感觉是：祖国的面貌全变了。和旧中国对比，我们的祖国变得太可爱了。华侨是最现实的，当他们踏上了祖国的土地，最使他们惊奇的是就在这短短几年中，祖国已经消灭了土匪、地方封建把头、妓女、赌博和鸦片烟。从他们到过的地方，他们亲身体会到社会风气有很大的改变，祖国已经做到“道不拾遗、夜不闭户”。在经济建设上，祖国的进步更是迅速的。通过华侨自己的眼睛，他们看到了祖国在共产党领导下，完成了许多伟大的建设事业。华侨故乡的福建不仅有全国最好的公路，而且有了全省同胞和国外侨胞多少年来渴望的铁路——鹰厦铁路。横跨长江，工程浩大的长江大桥，过去连想都不敢想的，现在也终于建成了。从辛亥革命到全国解放前，旧中国不但谈不上有什么重工业，就是轻工业也微弱得很。现在我们不但有自己制造的汽车，同时也有自己制造的喷气式飞机和用自己的材料制造的许多大型的工作母机。七年来我们在经济建设上的成就，连资本主义的国家也不敢加以否认，最近联合国世界经济报告亦承认我国在一九五六年工业增长速度占世界第一位。
    人民政府采取了多种措施来保护侨胞、侨眷的正当利益
    人民政府一向关怀国外华侨和国内侨眷的利益。解放初期，为使侨眷不受物价波动的影响，国家制定了原币汇款及存款办法。在我国币制稳定、某些国家币制贬值后，国家又制定人民币汇款的办法，以保障侨胞、侨眷的利益。而为了保护侨胞、侨眷的利益，根据宪法第十一条“国家保护公民的合法收入、储蓄、房屋和各种生活资料的所有权”的规定，国务院在一九五五年二月二十三日发布了关于贯彻保护侨汇政策的命令，使得广大华侨、侨眷普遍受到切身的利益。同时也使得华侨、侨眷把侨汇投入生产或者向国家投资公司入股，以及在家乡兴办公益事业得到保护和鼓励。人民政府还能付国民党反动统治时期的解放前银钱业未清偿存款，其中华侨、侨眷存款占相当大的数目，使受益的人喜出望外地感到像“饥者得食、渴者得饮”似的，对人民政府表示无限的感激。
    我们认识到，没有中国共产党的领导，就不能够打垮荼毒中国人民二十多年的国民党反动势力；没有中国共产党的领导，就不能够推翻帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在旧中国的统治与完成中国的新民主主义革命；没有中国共产党的领导，祖国的各方面的建设事业就不能够像今天这样突飞猛进，中国在国际上的政治威望就不能够像今天这样的提高。事实告诉我们，只有在中国共产党正确领导下，走社会主义的道路，我们祖国今天在各方面的成就才有可能。不管帝国主义和它的走狗，国内外一小撮的反革命分子对祖国如何诬蔑和仇视，却不能否认伟大的建设成就的铁一般的事实，在共产党领导下走社会主义道路的祖国是日益壮大起来。
    坚决击退右派分子的进攻，保卫祖国胜利的果实
    中国共产党为了加强全国上下的团结，加强党内外的团结，正确处理人民内部矛盾，开展了反对官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义的整风运动。通过这一运动来提高全党马克思主义的思想水平，改进作风，以适应社会主义改造和社会主义建设的需要，这对于国家、人民都是有益的，从这一点更可以说明我们的党——中国共产党是伟大的，我们的制度——社会主义制度是优越的。中国共产党是为人民服务的党，党就是最广大人民的利益的象征，就是祖国独立、富强与民主自由的明灯。从这次的整风运动也充分说明了中国共产党是能够不断地通过批评与自我批评来消除工作上的某些缺点和错误而前进的党。从这一点也就充分说明为什么中国共产党是包括华侨在内的全国人民所信赖的党。解放了的每一个中国的人民都不愿意使自己的祖国再成为半封建半殖民地，决不让帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国复辟。我们海外侨胞和全国人民坚决认定社会主义道路是祖国唯一应该走的道路。
    但在这次整风运动中，却出现了章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、陈新桂、储安平等别有用心的右派分子仇视共产党、仇视社会主义的言论和行动。这些别有用心的右派分子，企图利用整风来削弱人民民主专政，反对党的领导，反对社会主义，破坏我们的社会主义事业。我作为一个华侨又是一个工商业者，特别要揭发的是章乃器的反党、反社会主义的言论和行动。首先应该说，像我这样还须继续大力改造的一个资产阶级分子，由于阶级立场、观点、阶级感情的关系，仍然有时不免为章乃器的“蜜饯砒霜”所迷惑，如果没有这次党对右派分子的揭露，我还不能看出这是两条路线的斗争问题。譬如我在中共广州市委会统战部召开的座谈会上，我曾谈到小型工厂的党支部问题。我希望市委会考虑对某些条件不够的小型工厂是否都要设立党支部。这就说明我对党的组织制度的认识是非常无知的，更严重的是表现了在思想上对依靠党的领导不够，我必需坚决加以克服和提高，加紧自我教育，自我改造。章乃器的反党、反社会主义活动，是充分地集中地反映了资产阶级两面性的消极一面，是露骨地宣传资本主义的复辟，是一种反动的政治行动，并且施用歪曲、造谣、挑拨、煽动、欺骗、麻醉、笼络等等一切恶毒的无耻的手段，诽谤共产党和社会主义，企图对工商界煽起对党和政府的不满情绪，来达到他们的卑鄙龌龊不可告人的目的。为了维护祖国得来不易的革命胜利果实，为了巩固祖国的社会主义建设，为了表示包括华侨在内的全国人民对党的领导的信赖，我们要坚决和一切右派分子划清界限，和他们斗争到底，击退他们的猖狂进攻；我们要团结起来，坚决地永远在中国共产党的领导下前进，永远跟中国共产党走。
