On the Film Front

Cai Chusheng's Speech

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and other reports. Here, I will introduce the development of China's people's film industry over the past eight years for your reference.

Toxic Films Eliminated, Beneficial Films Occupy the Position

In this anti-rightist struggle, according to materials revealed from various aspects, the new China's people's film industry has also become one of the targets of the rightists' rampant attacks. They similarly adopted an attitude of negating everything to oppose the Party's leadership in the film industry. However, the facts can never be denied. Under the Party and the government's infinitely kind concern and guidance, the new China's people's film industry, along with the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation, has undergone great development and achieved great successes. This is prominently manifested in artistic creation, consistently adhering to Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. First of all, the films we produce, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, reflect the lives and struggles of the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers. In terms of content and nature, they are different from the works before liberation. As of the end of last year, over the past seven years, we have produced 266 various feature films, 1,183 short films, and translated 1,426 excellent foreign feature and short films. At the same time, in order to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we have also added several new types of films, such as newsreels, science education films, and animated films. Our news photography teams traveled across mountains and rivers, producing a large number of newsreels that timely reported on the construction and struggles carried out by the Chinese people in various fields. Some comrades even sacrificed their precious lives for this on the front lines. In spreading materialism and improving the people's scientific and cultural level, the role of science education films is also extremely significant. The production of animated films is also increasingly loved by the vast audience. Some of these types of films basically did not exist before liberation; especially the large-scale production of newsreels and science education films, which capitalist producers before liberation were unwilling to do.

Because our production implemented the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, our films inevitably established an inseparable connection with the broad masses of the people. Although some of our films are better and some are worse, the fact proves that everyone still likes to watch domestic films extremely much. After a period of struggle, we finally, in 1951, completely eliminated the imperialist toxic films that had long occupied the Chinese film market and eroded the Chinese people's thinking, and used our own films, films from socialist countries, and beneficial foreign films to occupy the position.

Many Films Welcomed by Audiences, Also Highly Reputable Internationally

In these eight years, the number of our film projection units has developed from 646 in the early days of liberation to more than 9,000, including more than 900 cinemas, nearly 7,000 projection teams, and more than 1,000 clubs. Our projection teams are widely distributed throughout the country, sending a large number of various films to factories, mines, rural areas, and ethnic minority areas. The result of resolutely serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers in this way is that film, the most mass-based art, has begun to exert its enormous role. In 1949, the number of film viewers was only more than 47 million, but in 1956 it reached nearly 1.4 billion. Using works that depict and express the lives and struggles of the Chinese people to educate the broad masses of the people, the breadth and depth of its influence is inestimable. For example, "The White Haired Girl" not only gave more than 100 million viewers a lesson in class education, but also encouraged the broad masses of peasants to resolutely struggle against the landlord class in the land reform. After the release of "An Incorrigible Scoundrel," a large number of reactionary secret society members immediately went to the public security departments to register themselves. After watching "Resist America, Aid Korea, First Collection" and "Steel Fighter," many viewers expressed: "The American imperialists' dream of using war to plunder the fruits of our country's victory is absolutely intolerable! We are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and resolutely rise up to defend the fruits of our revolution!" The heroic figures portrayed in "Dong Cunrui" and "Shangganling" left an indelible impression on the minds of the broad masses of the people. They will always inspire us to move forward and educate our children and grandchildren. Science education films such as "Cultivating Strong Seedlings," "Advanced Bricklaying Method," and "Foundation Construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge" widely disseminated industrial and agricultural production knowledge. Our stage art films not only enriched the cultural life of the people at home, but also gained international reputation; "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" has been to many countries and caused a sensation in Hong Kong, Macau, and Southeast Asia. Many of our films have also won international awards. Many of our films depicting revolutionary wars are welcomed by the people of Asia and Africa. For example, when "Chicken Feather Letter" was released in Egypt, it was called "China's First Volunteer Army." Our films have participated in various international activities or have been regularly screened in more than 40 countries. This great role and influence played internationally is something that could not have been imagined in the past.

A Good Foundation Has Been Laid in Film Technology and Industry

In addition, we have also laid a good foundation in film technology and industry, and have trained a considerable number of cadres. Various projectors can now be completely manufactured by ourselves; small cameras have been successfully trial-produced; large cameras, film developing machines, and recording machines are about to be trial-produced; wide-screen stereo equipment requiring high technology is being trial-produced; large film copy developing and printing factories and film manufacturing factories are being planned; color films have gone from nothing to something, and last year produced 30 feature and short films, and all of them have been able to master the technology from shooting to developing and printing themselves; the first wide-screen cinema has opened in the capital, and the first wide-screen documentary "May Day Festival" has met with the audience. Through training classes, rotation training classes, seminars, film academies, etc., more than 36,000 projectionists nationwide have been trained, as well as art creation cadres and various technical cadres, especially working cadres needed for those types of films that did not exist before liberation.

The above-mentioned many achievements can only be obtained under the leadership and care of the Party; the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" led by the Party has greatly improved the political and ideological level of film creators. Only under the leadership of the Party, and with the vigorous carrying out of the five major political movements across the country, can our film workers be ideologically transformed and create those achievements. The rightists say that having the Party's leadership is worse than not having the Party's leadership, or that the more the Party leads, the worse it gets. This is a purposeful, shameless, and malicious slander!

Errors and Shortcomings in the Film Industry Are Being Vigorously Overcome

While the film industry has achieved great development and achievements, it has also made some mistakes, had some serious shortcomings, and still has many shortcomings. In the early days of liberation, we took a correct path, but later made mistakes and shortcomings and took a detour; subsequently, some problems were not corrected in time, and at the same time, some new shortcomings arose.

Various types of films have their different situations and different problems, but artistic films have made more prominent errors in production and creation. For example, 26 films were produced in 1950, but 1951 was a blank year, and only 6 were reluctantly produced in 1952. After that, it increased every year during the correction of deviations, and only reached 38 last year. In addition to the inevitable factors such as lack of experience, the reason is that we have made subjectivist and dogmatic errors and have had shortcomings in both artistic leadership and business management.

In artistic leadership, first of all, we have unrealistically demanded the writing of so-called epic, monumental, and general "great works" that summarize a certain historical era. This subjectivism, which does not proceed from the truth of life, the needs of the people, and our artistic and technical level, caused us to deny a considerable number of scripts with a certain level from 1951 to 1952, greatly suffocating the output of artistic films, and making new and old creators feel great depression. Secondly, we had a narrow understanding of implementing the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a period of time, believing that serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers must almost entirely directly depict the workers, peasants, and soldiers, thus greatly restricting writers in the selection of themes. At the same time, under this erroneous understanding, the use of personnel, especially old artistic workers, was also subject to some undue restrictions. Thirdly, we have gained a lot in learning socialist realism, but we also have certain shortcomings, that is, we have not learned well, deeply, or thoroughly enough, creating some rigid rules and regulations, bringing constraints to creation; on the other hand, we have neglected the progressive traditions of the past film art industry and lacked the absorption of its valuable experience, which has also limited the richness and variety of films and limited the enthusiasm and creativity of creators.

The above-mentioned errors and shortcomings are generally manifested in violating the laws of artistic creation, interfering too much, and artistic films are more seriously affected. As a result, the output is small, the quality is not high, and the potential of artistic creators is not fully utilized. The audience does not like to watch some of our formulaic works, and they have put forward many well-intentioned and pertinent criticisms and opinions, which are worthy of attention by our leading workers and creators in future improvement work.

In addition, in business management, we have also made mistakes and shortcomings of being divorced from reality and neglecting progressive traditions. During the period when the output of artistic films was at its lowest, we attempted to abolish the existing film production bases in various places and concentrate all film production work in Beijing, which was a serious and extremely erroneous idea that was divorced from the reality of our country with 600 million people and vast territory. In various aspects of the film industry, some of the systems, regulations, and methods are also managed too strictly, too rigidly, and too centrally. For example, a film has to go through multiple repeated review and approval procedures from the theme plan, literary script, storyboard script, actor sample film, entire sample film to the finished film, and so on.

During the eight years, these errors and shortcomings have been continuously improved, and some have been vigorously criticized and corrected. After the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," there have been more significant improvements, such as decentralizing the power of creation, making the film studio a complete art creation and film production institution. However, some problems have not been completely resolved. For example, actors and orchestras have not been given sufficient opportunities for artistic practice due to the small output of works, and efforts still need to be made to improve this in the future.

The Rightists' Negation of the Achievements of the Film Industry Is to Engage in Capitalist Film Production

In the past eight years, the achievements of China's people's film industry have been great, and can be said to be unprecedented, and should not be negated. However, some people ignore reality, emphasize the shortcomings of the small output of artistic films in a certain period and the low quality of some works, clamoring loudly to retreat, to retreat to before liberation, and call it "for the sake of progress." This kind of clamor is clearly exaggerating shortcomings, negating achievements, and thus drawing the conclusion that everything has gone wrong since liberation. They live in the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party, in the socialist system and the people's democratic dictatorship, and absurdly believe that these shortcomings are the result of implementing the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They do not see that the films after liberation reflect the lives and struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is an epoch-making event, an expansion rather than a reduction of themes, and also something that would be impossible under reactionary rule. We once narrowly understood the direction of the workers, peasants, and soldiers due to subjectivism, causing shortcomings in our work, but it is extremely erroneous to say that we can do without the direction of the workers, peasants, and soldiers because of this. They even use capitalist methods, purely proceeding from box office value, to prove that our films have been abandoned by the workers, peasants, and soldiers; calculating income and expenditure, we also have a surplus to hand over to the state treasury, and this surplus is also increasing year by year. They do not see that the connection between our films and the masses is expanding unprecedentedly, and that thousands upon thousands of people have received increasingly deep and broad education and influence from the films. They do not see the fact that most of the audience are workers, peasants, and ethnic minorities who could not see movies at all before liberation. They found another reason, the so-called "administrative interference," believing that the small number and poor quality of works are the result of administrative interference. As I mentioned above about shortcomings and errors, they seem to have found the "key"; however, while opposing "administrative interference" in artistic creation, they unconsciously exposed their own position. It turns out that under the guise of flourishing creation and freedom of creation, they even want to oppose the leadership of the Party and the government in the political content, artistic ideas, and planned production of films, which cannot but make people feel that they want to engage in capitalist film production. They equated leadership with "interference," and regarded "administration" and "interference" as twin brothers, so all leadership - including Party and administrative leadership - in all matters is considered to be laymen, all "interference," and they say that this kind of leadership can at most copy dogmas, so the more leadership, the worse it gets, and it must be completely and entirely abolished!…

What exactly is going on?

"The Film Gongs and Drums" Cannot Be Struck, The Rightists' Ugly Faces Reveal Their True Colors

In the autumn of last year, in order to improve shortcomings and work, we followed the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" put forward by the Party Central Committee, and held a series of meetings to discuss and formulate a plan to improve film production in order to implement this policy. Just when we were preparing to improve according to this plan, Chen Renbing, a rightist in the Shanghai rightist group in the Zhang-Luo Alliance, used the Shanghai Film Studio's China Democratic League branch, set aside the Party and administrative leadership in the factory, and successively held five forums, using this factory as their arson point! At the same time, Shanghai's Wenhui Bao immediately cooperated with this activity, launching the discussion of "Why Are There So Few Good Domestic Films?" The newspaper and its Beijing office also seized the article "The Film Gongs and Drums," adding fuel to the fire, and clamoring with all their might. In those forums and discussions, many opinions were worth considering, some were correct, and some were wrong. However, the organizers of the forums and discussions were clearly purposeful. They excluded positive remarks, attacked comrades who spoke fairly as "big shots," did not speak for "little people," and even people who spoke aggressively could be approved for "joining the league on the front line" on the spot. The purpose was to exaggerate the shortcomings in the film industry as much as possible, negate achievements, provoke the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, and oppose the Party's leadership!

Through this nationwide struggle against rightist elements, the rights and wrongs have been made clear to the world, and their ugly faces have been exposed! Luo Longji - Chen Renbing - Shanghai Film Studio's China Democratic League branch is one line, and Luo Longji - Pu Xixiu - Wenhui Bao is another line. These two lines are connected, following the Zhang-Luo Alliance's program of attacking the Party, opposing the Party's leadership in the film industry, and negating the achievements of the film industry in the past eight years, attempting to open a gap in cultural work. This series of events was greatly praised by the Zhang-Luo Alliance, who considered it a "typical experience" and wanted to use this experience to set fires everywhere. Obviously, the Zhang-Luo Alliance was not for anything else, but to slander and negate the great achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in the socialist revolution and construction, which are unprecedented in ancient and modern times, and attempted to make the Party "step down," to make counter-revolutionaries rise up to "claim lives," and at the same time some people wanted to "kill the Communist Party,"… In a word, it was to engage in capitalist restoration, to drag the Chinese people back to the abyss of suffering in the past!

All of our film workers must distinguish between right and wrong, stand firm, draw a clear line with the rightists in this anti-rightist struggle, and draw sufficient lessons from the development of events since last year. People who have been deceived or used should turn back from their errors, thoroughly expose the crimes of the rightists, and confess the mistakes they have made in order to seek the forgiveness of the people. Otherwise, they will isolate themselves from the people and will be forever spurned by the people!

Let More Brilliant Flowers Bloom in the Garden of Film Art

Let all of our film workers mobilize, to defend our great motherland, to defend our infinitely superior socialist system, and under the leadership of the Party, carry out a resolute struggle against the anti-Party and anti-socialist rightist elements, until their evil conspiracy is completely, thoroughly, and cleanly smashed!

In addition, we must strive to improve our level of Marxism-Leninism in the days to come, delve into life, continuously carry out ideological transformation, strengthen the study of artistic theory and skills, continue to study business, better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and well accept the excellent traditions of Chinese film and Chinese literature and art, in order to improve the quantity and quality of our works. With the vigorous development of our country's socialist economic construction and the increasingly urgent demands of the broad masses of the people for culture and art, our cause must accelerate development. For example: technical equipment and raw material supply will mostly be self-manufactured without relying on foreign countries in the second five-year plan; new film studios are being planned in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Xi'an; the target of producing 100 artistic films per year will be reached in the second five-year plan; excellent foreign films will still be translated into Chinese dialogue in large quantities and widely screened in the country; the themes of newsreels will be oriented to the whole country, widely developed and improved in quality; science education films will greatly increase production, playing a pioneering role in the technical revolution of socialist construction; animated films will also increase production and pay more attention to national style… and so on.

We believe that the film workers of the whole country, under the leadership of our great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, and with the support of local governments and people from all walks of life, will be full of confidence, continue to implement the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, continue to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," continue to earnestly and practically improve leadership and management work, improve systems and various systems, further exert the potential of various staff members, and constantly strive to prosper film creation, increase output, and improve quality, thereby promoting Chinese film art to achieve higher achievements, and making more brilliant and beautiful flowers bloom in the garden of film art!

### 在电影战线上  蔡楚生的发言

专栏：

    在电影战线上
    蔡楚生的发言
    我完全同意和拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告和其他的各项报告。在这里，我将八年来中国人民电影事业发展的情况介绍一下，供大家参考。
    有毒的影片被排除干净  有益的影片占领了阵地
    在这次反右派的斗争中，根据各方面所揭发出来的材料，新中国的人民电影事业，也成为右派分子猖狂进攻的目标之一，他们同样地采取了抹煞一切的态度，来反对党在电影事业中的领导。但是，事实永远是抹煞不了的，新中国人民的电影事业，在党和政府无限亲切的关心与指导下，随着国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造，有着很大的发展和成绩。突出地表现在艺术创作上，一贯地坚持着毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向。首先，我们制作的影片，是在马克思列宁主义的指导下，反映我国工农兵人民大众的生活和斗争的，在内容和性质上，已和解放前的作品不同。截至去年底，七年来，我们已制作了各种长片二百六十六部、短片一千一百八十三部，翻译了优秀的长短外国片一千四百二十六部。同时，为了更好地为工农兵服务，还增加了新闻纪录片、科学教育片、美术片等几种新的片种。我们的新闻摄影队，跋山涉水，制作了大量的及时报道我国人民在各方面所进行的建设与斗争的新闻纪录片，有的同志并在火线上为此而献出自己宝贵的生命。在传播唯物主义思想、提高人民的科学文化水平上，科学教育片的作用也是极其显著的。美术片的制作，也日益受到广大观众的喜爱。这些片种，有些在解放以前基本上是没有的；尤其是新闻纪录片和科学教育片的大量制作，更是解放前的资本家所不肯为的。
    由于我们的制作贯彻了为工农兵服务的方向，我们的影片就必然地与广大人民建立了不可分割的联系。虽然我们的影片有较好也有较差的，但事实证明，大家还是极其喜欢看国产影片的。我们经过了一番斗争，终于在一九五一年，把长久盘踞着中国电影市场的、侵蚀着中国人民思想的、帝国主义有毒的影片彻底排除干净，并用我国自制的影片、社会主义国家的影片、以及有益的外国影片来占领阵地。
    许多影片受到观众欢迎  在国际上也有很高声誉
    这八年中，我国的放映单位已从解放初期的六百四十六个发展到九千多个，其中包括九百多个电影院、将近七千个放映队和一千多个俱乐部。我们的放映队，广布全国，将大量的各种影片送到工矿、农村、少数民族地区去。这样坚决地为工农兵服务的结果，才使电影这一最具有群众性的艺术，开始发挥它巨大的作用。一九四九年的电影观众只有四千七百多万人次，一九五六年已高达近十四亿人次。用描写和表现我国人民的生活与斗争的作品来教育广大的人民，其影响的广泛和深刻，更是不可估量的。如“白毛女”，不只是给一亿多观众上了阶级教育的一课，并且在土地改革中，鼓励了广大农民向地主阶级作坚决斗争的意志。“一贯害人道”上映后，大批反动会道门的分子，立刻就纷纷自动向公安部门去登记。看了“抗美援朝第一辑”“钢铁战士”的观众，很多人这样表示：“美帝国主义者梦想用战争掠夺我国的胜利果实，这是决不能容忍的！我们随时响应祖国号召，坚决起来保卫我们革命的果实！”“董存瑞”“上甘岭”所表现的英雄人物形象，在广大人民的思想上留下了不可磨灭的印象，他们将永远鼓舞着我们前进，并教育着我们的子孙。“培育壮秧”“先进砌砖法”“武汉长江大桥基础施工”等科学教育片，广泛地传播了工农业的生产知识。我们的舞台艺术片，不但丰富了国内人民的文化生活，而且获得了国际上的声誉；“梁山伯与祝英台”即到过许多国家，并轰动了港澳和东南亚。我们还有许多影片获得了国际上的褒奖。我们很多描写革命战争的影片，得到亚非人民的欢迎，如“鸡毛信”在埃及上映时即被称为是“中国的第一支志愿军”。我们的影片在四十多个国家参加过各种国际活动或作经常的放映，这种在国际上所起的很大的作用和影响，更是过去所不能想望的。
    电影技术和工业方面已奠定了良好的基础
    此外，我们在电影技术和工业方面也已奠定了良好的基础，并培养了相当数量的干部。各种放映机现在已完全可以自己制造；小型摄影机已试制成功；大型摄影机、洗片机、录音机即将试制完成；需要高度技术的宽银幕立体声设备正进行试制；大型影片拷贝洗印厂和胶片制造厂正在筹建；彩色影片从无到有，去年已生产长短影片三十部，而且全部都已能够自己掌握从拍摄到洗印的技术；第一座宽银幕影院已在首都开幕，第一部宽银幕纪录片
  “五月的节日”已与观众相见。通过训练班、轮训班、讲习会、电影学院等，已培养了全国三万六千多放映员，和培养了艺术创作干部与各种技术干部，特别是培养了解放前所没有的那些片种所需要的工作干部。
    上述这许多成绩，是只有在党的领导和关怀下才能获得的；党所领导的对“武训传”影片的批判，更大大地提高了电影创作人员的政治思想水平。也只有在党的领导下，全国轰轰烈烈地进行了五大政治运动，我们的电影工作者才能得到思想改造，才能创造出那些成绩来。右派分子说有党的领导不如没有党的领导，或是说党越领导越坏，这是别有用心的、无耻而恶毒的毁谤！
    电影事业中的错误和缺点正在大力克服
    电影事业在获得了很大的发展和成就的同时，也犯过一些错误，有过一些严重的缺点，至今也还存在着不少缺点。解放初期，我们走过一段正确的道路，后来产生了错误和缺点而走了一段弯路；随后，有的问题纠正得还不够及时，同时又有些新的缺点产生。
    各种片种都有它不同的情况和存在着不同的问题，但以艺术片在生产和创作上所犯过的错误为较突出。如一九五○年生产了二十六部影片，一九五一年竟是一个空白年，一九五二年勉强生产了六部，其后在纠偏中每年增长，到去年才达到三十八部。除由于缺乏经验等不可避免的因素外，其原因是我们在艺术领导上和事业管理上都曾犯过主观主义和教条主义的错误与存在过缺点。
    在艺术领导上，首先我们就曾脱离实际地要求写所谓史诗式、纪念碑式的、概括某一个历史时代的“伟大作品”。这种不从生活的真实、人民的需要和我们艺术、技术的实际水平出发的主观主义，使我们在一九五一年到一九五二年间否定了具有一定水平的相当多的剧本，艺术片的产量大大地受了窒息，并使新老的创作工作者都感到莫大的苦闷。其次是，我们对贯彻为工农兵服务的方向上，在一个时期内有过狭隘的理解，认为为工农兵服务，就非几乎全部是直接描写工农兵不可，因此而使作家在对题材的选择上，大大地受到了不应有的限制。同时，在这种错误的理解下，人员的使用，尤其是老的艺术工作者，也随之受到一些不应有的限制。再次，我们在学习社会主义现实主义上，是有很大的收获的，但也有一定的缺点，那就是我们还学习得不好、不深不透，造成了一些清规戒律，给创作带来了束缚；在另一方面，我们又忽视过去电影艺术事业的进步传统，缺乏吸取其可取的经验，这也限制了影片的丰富多采、限制了创作人员的积极性和创造性。
    上述这些错误和缺点，总的是表现在违反艺术创作的规律，干涉过多，受影响的以艺术片较为严重，其结果是产量少、质量不高，艺术创作人员的潜力发挥不够。我们某些流于公式的作品，观众是不喜欢看的，他们并提出了许多善意的、中肯的批评和意见，是值得我们的领导工作者和创作工作者在今后的改进工作中加以重视的。
    此外，在事业管理上，我们也曾有过脱离实际、忽视进步传统的错误和缺点。在上述艺术片生产量最低落的期间，就曾企图废弃已有各地的制片基地，把制片工作等全部都集中到北京来，这是一种严重地脱离了我们这样拥有六亿人口、辽阔广大的国家的实际的极端错误的想法。电影事业的各个方面，在体制上、制度和办法上，有些也管得过严过死过于集中，如一部影片从主题计划、文学剧本、分镜头剧本、演员样片、全部样片到完成片等，就要经过多次的反复审查、批准的手续等等。
    八年的过程中，这些错误和缺点在不断地改进着，有些已得到大力的批判和纠正。在党中央提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针后，更有显著的改进，如将创作的职权下放，使制片厂成为完整的艺术创作和制片生产的机构。但有些问题还未彻底解决，如演员、乐团，因为作品的产量少，没有给他们以充分的艺术实践的机会，还需要在今后努力设法加以改善。
    右派抹煞电影事业的成就是要搞资本主义电影生产
    八年来，中国人民电影事业的成绩是很大的，可以说是空前的，绝不容加以抹煞的；可是偏偏有人无视现实，强调了某一个时期艺术片的产量不多，和某些作品质量不高的缺点，大肆叫嚣，要向后退，退到解放前去，而美其名曰“为了前进”。这种叫嚣，明明是夸大缺点，抹煞成绩，因而得出了解放以来一切都搞糟了的结论。他们生活在共产党领导下的新中国，生活在社会主义制度和人民民主专政的政权下，竟荒谬到认为这些缺点是贯彻工农兵方向的结果。他们看不到解放后的影片反映了工农兵的生活和斗争是个划时代的事件，是题材的扩大而不是缩小，同时也是反动统治下绝不可能做到的事情。我们曾因主观主义而狭隘地理解工农兵方向，造成了工作中的缺点，但因此而说可以不要工农兵方向则是极端谬误的。他们甚至于以资本主义的方法，单纯地从票房价值出发，去证明我们的影片被工农兵所抛弃；计算一下收支，我们也是有盈余上缴国库的，并且这种盈余还在逐年增长。他们没有看到我们的影片与群众的联系正在空前地扩大着，千千万万的人民受到了电影日益深广的教育和影响。他们更没有看到大部分的观众是解放前根本就看不到电影的工人、农民和少数民族的这一事实。他们找到另一原因是所谓“行政干涉”，认为作品之少和不好是行政干涉的结果。正如我上面所提到的缺点和错误，他们像是找到了“要害”；可是，他们在反对艺术创作的“行政干涉”之余，却不自觉地把自己的立场暴露出来了。原来他们在繁荣创作、创作自由的幌子下，却连影片的政治内容、艺术思想和计划生产都要反对党和政府的领导，这就不能不使人感到他们是要搞资本主义的电影生产。他们把领导和“干涉”划了个等号，把“行政”和“干涉”看成了孪生兄弟，因之把一切领导——包括党和行政领导——在一切问题上的领导，都被认为是外行，都是“干涉”，而说这种领导最多也不过会搬搬教条，所以是愈领导愈糟，必须彻底、全部取消！……
    这究竟是怎么一回事呢？
    “电影的锣鼓”敲不起来  右派的丑脸显露原形
    去年秋季，我们为了改进缺点和工作，遵循着党中央所提出的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，召开了一系列的会议，讨论和制订了为贯彻这一方针而改进制片工作的方案。正当准备按此方案进行改进的时候，章罗联盟中的上海右派集团的陈仁炳，就利用了上海电影制片厂的民盟支部，撇开了厂中党和行政上的领导，先后召开了五次座谈会，把这个厂当作他们的放火点！同时，上海的文汇报也立即配合着这一活动，发起了“为什么好的国产片这样少？”的讨论，该报及其驻京办事处同时又抓住了“电影的锣鼓”一文，火上加油，悉力叫嚣。在那些座谈和讨论中，有许多意见是值得我们考虑的，有些也是正确的，也有些是错误的。而座谈和讨论的组织者们，却很明显地是别有用心的，他们排斥正面言论，打击说公道话的同志是
  “大人物”，不替“小人物”说话，甚至发言激烈的人可以当场被批准“火线入盟”。目的则在尽量夸大电影事业中的缺点，抹煞成绩，挑拨党与非党的关系，反对党的领导！
    通过这次全国反右派分子的斗争，是非已大白于天下，他们的丑恶的嘴脸已被暴露出来了！罗隆基——陈仁炳——上海电影制片厂民盟支部是一条线，罗隆基——浦熙修——文汇报又是一条线。这两条线脉络相通，按照着章罗联盟向党进攻的纲领，反对党在电影事业中的领导和抹煞电影事业八年来所获得的成就，企图在文化工作上打出一个缺口。这一连串的事件，大受章罗联盟的赞许，认为是“典型经验”，要使用这种经验到处放火。很显然，章罗联盟不是为了别的，而是从各个方面来毁谤和否定中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在社会主义革命和建设上所获得的震烁古今、史无前例的伟大的成就，并企图要党“下台”，要反革命者都起来“索命”，同时也有人要“杀共产党”，……一句话，就是要搞资本主义复辟，要把中国人民拖回到过去那个苦难的深渊！
    我们全体的电影工作者，在这次反右派的斗争中，必须明辨是非，站稳立场，和右派分子划清界线，并从去年以来事件的发展中吸取足够的经验教训。如是受过迷惑或被利用的人，就应迷途立返，彻底地揭露右派分子的罪行，和交代自己所犯的错误，以求得人民的宽恕，否则就是自绝于人民，而将永为人民所唾弃！
    让电影艺术的园地中开放出更灿烂的花朵
    让我们全体电影工作者都动员起来，为捍卫我们伟大的祖国，为捍卫我们无限优越的社会主义制度，而在党的领导下，向反党、反社会主义的右派分子进行坚决的斗争，一直到把他们这种罪恶的阴谋全部、彻底、干净地粉碎了为止！
    此外，我们还要在今后的日子中，努力提高马克思列宁主义水平，深入生活，不断进行思想改造，加强对艺术理论和技巧的学习，继续钻研业务，更好地学习苏联先进经验，并很好地接受中国电影和中国文学艺术上优良的传统，以提高我们作品的数量和质量。随着我国社会主义经济建设的蓬勃发展，与广大人民对文化艺术所提出的日益迫切的要求，我们的事业还须加速发展。如：技术设备和原材料的供应，在第二个五年计划内大部分都要不依赖国外，而期能自行制造；北京、广州和西安正在筹建新的制片厂；第二个五年计划中将要达到年产一百部艺术片的指标；优秀的外国片仍将大量译制华语对白，在国内广泛放映；新闻纪录片的题材将要面向全国，广加发展并提高质量；科学教育片将要大量增加产量，使在社会主义建设的技术革命中起到先锋的作用；美术片也要增加产量和更多地注意民族风格……等等。
    我们相信，全国的电影工作者，在我们伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在中央人民政府的领导下，在各地政府及各界人士的支持下，一定会满怀着信心，继续贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方向，继续执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，继续认真和切实地改善领导管理工作，改善体制和各项制度，进一步发挥各种工作人员的潜在力量，不断地为繁荣电影创作、增加产量、提高质量而奋斗，从而促使中国的电影艺术获致更高的成就，使电影艺术的园地中开放出更灿烂美丽的花朵！
