Only the Communist Party Can Thoroughly Liberate Ethnic Minorities
Ma Leting Discusses Significant Political and Economic Changes Among the Hui People of Anhui

    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Report on the Work of the Government and the other work reports submitted to the congress. Now I would like to offer some opinions on the production and living conditions of the Hui people in Anhui.
    Before liberation, our Anhui Hui people (approximately 140,000) were cruelly exploited and oppressed under reactionary rule. Most were engaged in petty trade, leading a precarious existence. They had no political standing in society, and their economy and culture were extremely impoverished and backward. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the implementation of the policy of national equality, the broad masses of Hui people in our province have achieved complete liberation in politics, economics, and culture. This is primarily manifested in the political sphere: in recent years, over a thousand Hui cadres have been trained and promoted to participate in the work of governments at all levels, achieving the status of being masters of our own affairs. According to election statistics, 718 Hui people were elected as grassroots people's representatives, 207 were elected as city and county people's representatives in 39 cities and counties, 7 were elected as provincial people's representatives, and 7 were members of the provincial CPPCC. According to the provisions of the electoral law, the population of Hui people in our province is not sufficient to elect a National People's Congress representative, but our province elected one nonetheless. In Xiuning County, where there are only five Hui households, one county people's representative was elected. Furthermore, in the Erlong Township, a Hui-populated area in Dingyuan, an ethnic township was established, and the cadres were ethnicized, allowing the Hui people to manage their own affairs. I deeply feel that only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the Hui people have political status.
    We have not only turned over politically but have also received strong support from the government economically. During the land reform, we Hui people, like our Han brothers, were allocated land and other property. In order to support the rapid development of production and improve the lives of the Hui people, the government also allocated a large amount of special funds for production subsidies, and banks provided low-interest loans. Social relief was also given priority to helping the Hui people solve many difficulties in production and life.
    In 1956, during the high tide of socialist transformation, the Hui people of our province, along with the broad masses of the people, joyfully embarked on the road of socialism. In rural areas, more than 98 percent of the Hui people joined agricultural producers' cooperatives, forming over 500 cooperatives together with our Han brothers. They actively engaged in developing production and, after a tense struggle against natural disasters, achieved great results, consolidating the agricultural cooperatives and increasing the income of most members. According to a survey of the Sipu Central Agricultural Cooperative in Wuhe County (a cooperative with more Hui people than Han people, totaling 224 households with 1,019 people), although it suffered a major flood last year, it overcame the natural disaster because of the greater strength of being organized, the advantages of collective disaster resistance, the implementation of production reforms, and the strong support from the government and the Han people. As a result, it achieved a 40 percent increase in production compared to when they were farming individually in the past. The lives of the cooperative members have also improved significantly. In a short period after the autumn harvest, 25 cooperative member households built new houses, 34 renovated old houses, and the members collectively bought more than 18,000 feet of cloth, sewed 1,500 cotton-padded clothes, 450 unlined clothes, made 20 new cotton quilts, and bought 280 health shirts, 60 pairs of sneakers, 45 pairs of rubber shoes, and 15 thermos bottles. The family of cooperative member Liu Wanli lacked grain for several months of the year before joining the cooperative and had never worn cotton pants in winter. After joining the cooperative, not only did he not lack grain, but he also built a new house, married a wife, and his entire family of six added six sets of cotton-padded clothes and three health shirts.
    The Hui people living in cities and towns, under the government's policy of overall planning and appropriate arrangements, had their businesses and stalls placed under joint public-private ownership or cooperative management. Personnel were also appropriately arranged, and the government gave priority to labor employment. At the same time, it also organized impoverished urban Hui people to develop various sideline productions, with the government providing support and care in terms of funds, technology, and taxation. This not only provided production opportunities for some Hui people who had no fixed occupations and whose families lacked labor, but also improved their lives. For example, Cheng Yushun, a Hui member of the Bo County Saltpeter Production Cooperative, had not had a quilt for the past ten years, but this year he made two cotton quilts. Zhang Shoufa of the Hefei Railway Station Catering Cooperative Group used to have a very hard life, and his whole family did not even have a cotton quilt. Now three members of his family participate in the cooperative group, earning a monthly salary of 130 yuan. This not only improved his life, but he also added new quilts and new clothes this year.
    In recent years, the government has also strongly supported the development of cultural and educational undertakings for the Hui people, allocating nearly 400,000 yuan in special education subsidies to help Hui primary schools build school buildings, purchase equipment, subsidize the lives of Hui employees, and solve the difficulties of Hui middle school students in seeking education. At present, there are 32 Hui primary schools in the province with 13,964 students, accounting for 10 percent of the total Hui population; and 1,470 Hui middle school students, accounting for 1.05 percent of the total Hui population. Before liberation, there were no Hui college students in Shouxian County, but now there are 13 college students in Chengguan Town alone. At the same time, the government also provides special funds to support medical treatment for Hui people's diseases. In 1956 alone, 14,108 people in the province enjoyed medical reduction and exemption, using more than 18,000 yuan. Hui clinics were also established in Bengbu and Wuhu, which greatly improved the health conditions of the Hui people. In addition, special care and attention are given to the living arrangements of Ahongs (Imams), and the supply of beef, oil, and grain for the three major festivals.
    The above facts fully demonstrate that only the Communist Party and the People's Government can thoroughly liberate our ethnic minorities, enable us to escape the suffering of oppression and exploitation, and gradually improve our economic and cultural living standards. Only the socialist system has brought us prosperity and happiness. Some right-wing elements say that the Communist Party has messed things up, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. They are closing their eyes and talking nonsense, and they have ulterior motives. From our personal experiences in the past few years, we Hui people deeply understand that without the Chinese Communist Party, the Hui people would not have the good life we have today. We resolutely support the leadership of the Communist Party, uphold the socialist system, and will never allow any anti-Party or anti-socialist conspiracies. Our Hui people, along with the people of the whole country, will resolutely crush the attacks of the right-wing elements to defend our achievements. Of course, the lives of our Hui people are not yet so good now, and some still face difficulties. But it is certain that they are much better than before liberation. This is not because the Communist Party has messed things up, but precisely the result of the long-term exploitation and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. We Hui people have full confidence that, under the leadership and support of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, we will rely on our own strength to overcome various difficulties and, together with the people of all ethnic groups, build a prosperous and happy socialism, and further improve our living standards on the basis of developing production.

    只有共产党才使少数民族得到彻底的解放
    马乐庭谈安徽回民政治上、经济上的重大变化
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和提交大会的其他几个工作报告。现在我就安徽的回民生产、生活情况，发表一点意见。
    我们安徽的回民（约十四万人）解放前在反动统治的残酷剥削与压迫下，大都从事小商小贩，过着朝不保夕的生活，在社会上没有政治地位，经济文化也都是极端贫困和落后。解放后在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，贯彻了民族平等政策，我省广大回族人民不论在政治、经济、文化上都获得了彻底解放，首先表现在政治方面：几年来培养和提拔了回民干部约一千人以上参加各级政权工作，做到了当家作主。据普选统计，回民当选为基层人民代表的有七百一十八人，在三十九个市县中当选为市县人民代表的有二百零七人；当选省人民代表的有七人；省政协委员的七人。如果根据选举法规定我省回民是不够选一个全国人民代表的，可是我省却选出了一名；休宁县只有五户回民也选了一名县人民代表；在定远回民聚居区二龙乡还建立了民族乡，干部实行了民族化，由回民自己管理自己的事务。我深深体会，只有中国共产党领导，才能有回民的政治地位。
    我们不但在政治上翻了身，同时在经济上也得到政府的大力支持。土改时我们回民和汉民兄弟一样分得了土地等五大财产。政府为了支持回民迅速发展生产和改善生活，还拨发了大量的生产补助专款，并由银行发放低利贷款，社会救济也都给予优先照顾，帮助回民解决了很多生产上和生活上的困难。
    一九五六年我省回民在社会主义改造高潮中和广大人民一道，欢欣鼓舞地走上了社会主义的道路。在农村，有百分之九十八以上的回民参加了农业生产合作社，与汉民兄弟共同组织了五百多个社，积极地进行发展生产，经过和自然灾害进行紧张的斗争，取得了很大的成绩，使农业社巩固下来，社员收入大都有所增加。据五河县四铺中心农业社（是个回民多汉民少的社，计224户1019人）调查，去年虽然受了很大的涝灾，但由于组织起来力量大，发挥了集体抗灾的优越性，实行了生产改革，并得到了政府和汉民的大力支援，因而就战胜了自然灾害，获得了比过去单干时增产四成的收成，社员的生活也随着有了显著的提高。该社在秋收后不长的一个时期，就有二十五户社员盖了新房，三十四户翻修了旧房，社员们共买布一万八千多尺，缝制棉衣一千五百多件，单衣四百五十件，做新棉被二十床，购买卫生衣二百八十件、球鞋六十双、胶鞋四十五双、热水瓶十五个。社员刘万礼家，入社前一年要缺几个月口粮，冬天未穿过棉裤，入社后不仅口粮不缺，还盖了新房，娶了媳妇，全家六口添制棉衣六套，卫生衣三件。
    住在城镇的回民，在政府统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针下，经营的企业和摊贩都分别实行公私合营或合作经营，人员亦得到适当安排，政府并在劳动就业上给予优先照顾。同时还组织了城市贫苦回民开展各种副业生产，政府在资金、技术和税收上都给予支持和照顾，不仅使部分无固定职业的和家庭缺少劳动力的回民有了生产门路，而且也改善了他们的生活。例如亳县制硝生产社回民程玉顺，过去十来年都没有被子，今年做了两床棉被。合肥车站饮食合作小组的张寿发过去生活很苦，全家连棉被都没有，现有三人参加合作小组，每月得工资一百三十元，这不但改善了生活，今年还添制了新被和新衣。
    几年来政府还大力支持回民发展文教事业。拨发了近四十万元教育补助专款，帮助回民小学修建校舍，添置设备，补助回民员工生活，解决回民中学生求学的困难。现在全省共有回民小学三十二所，学生一万三千九百六十四人，占回民总人口的百分之十；回民中学生一千四百七十人，占回民总人口的百分之一点零五。解放前寿县没有回民大学生，现在仅城关镇就有大学生十三人。同时政府对回民疾病医疗方面，也有专款支持，仅一九五六年全省享受医疗减免费的有一万四千一百零八人次，用款一万八千多元，还在蚌埠、芜湖两市建立回民诊所，这就大大地改善了回民的卫生条件。另外对阿訇生活照顾问题，三大节宰牛、油粮供应等等也都给予特殊关怀和照顾。
    以上事实充分说明，只有共产党和人民政府才使我们少数民族得到彻底的解放，使我们摆脱了受压迫、受剥削的苦难，逐步提高了我们的经济、文化生活水平；只有社会主义制度，才给我们带来了繁荣和幸福。有些右派分子说共产党把事情都办糟了，这是完全不符合事实的。是闭着眼睛说瞎话，这是别有用心的。我们回民从几年来的亲身体验中，深刻的了解，没有中国共产党就没有回民今天的好日子。我们坚决地拥护共产党的领导，拥护社会主义制度，决不容许任何反党、反社会主义的阴谋。我省回民和全国人民一道坚决地粉碎右派分子进攻，来保卫我们的胜利果实。当然我们回民的生活现在还不是那么美好，有的还存在着一些困难，肯定的说比解放前好多了，但这并不是共产党搞糟的，而正是国民党反动统治长期剥削压榨的结果。我们回民有充分的信心在中国共产党和人民政府的领导与支持下，依靠本身力量，克服各种困难，和各族人民一起共同建设繁荣幸福的社会主义，在发展生产的基础上进一步地提高我们的生活水平。
