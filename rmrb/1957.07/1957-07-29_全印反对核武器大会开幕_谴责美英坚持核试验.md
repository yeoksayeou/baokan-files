Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 28th: The All-India Anti-Nuclear Weapons Conference opened in New Delhi on the evening of the 27th.

The conference was initiated by over one hundred members of parliament and social celebrities. It will send a delegation to participate in the World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs to be held in Tokyo in August.

The chairman of the All-India Anti-Nuclear Weapons Conference, Ramishwary Nehru, said in her opening speech that NATO countries and the entire Southeast Asia region have stored a great number of nuclear weapons. The people and government of India have unanimously protested. They recognize that India cannot avoid the common danger.

She said that the conference "declares to the world: We are determined to unite with people in other parts of the world to demand that such weapons no longer be produced, that such tests no longer be conducted, and that all existing stockpiles be destroyed."

Parliamentarians Anup Singh, Hirendra Mukerjee, Naushir Bharucha, Govinda Reddy, and Braham Prakash all called for an immediate ban on nuclear testing in their speeches. Some warned that the US decision to transport nuclear weapons to South Korea increased the danger to Asia. Most speakers criticized the United States and the United Kingdom for continuing to conduct nuclear tests when the Soviet Union had already announced its agreement to ban such weapons. They demanded that the United States and the United Kingdom respect world public opinion.

    全印反对核武器大会开幕  谴责美英坚持核试验
    据新华社新德里28日电　全印反对核武器代表大会27日傍晚在新德里开幕。
    代表大会是由一百多名国会议员和社会名流发起的。它将派遣代表团参加8月份在东京举行的禁止原子弹和氢弹世界大会。
    全印反对核武器代表大会主席拉米希瓦里·尼赫鲁在开幕词中说，北大西洋公约组织国家和整个东南亚都储存了好多核武器。印度人民和政府一致提出抗议。他们认识到，印度也避免不了大家共同的危险。
    她说，代表大会“向全世界宣布：我们决心和世界上其他地区的人民团结一致，要求不再生产这种武器，不再进行这种试验，并且销毁所有现存的储备”。
    议员阿努普·辛格、希伦·慕克吉、诺什尔·巴鲁查、戈文达·雷迪和布腊姆·普腊卡什在演说中都要求立即禁止核试验。有些人警告说，美国关于运送核武器到南朝鲜去的决定对亚洲增加了危险。大部分发言的人都批评美国和联合王国在苏联已经宣布同意禁止这种武器的时候还坚持进行核试验。他们要求美国和联合王国尊重世界舆论。
