We industrialists and businessmen, along with the people of the whole country, celebrate the glorious festival of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army with excitement and gratitude.

We industrialists and businessmen sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army: The great spirit and fine qualities of the People's Liberation Army have changed our perception of the army and made us fall in love with the people's own army. We industrialists and businessmen have experienced the long-term civil wars of the warlords and the long-term exploitation of the Kuomintang, suffering from the evils of the reactionary army's rape, plunder, and all kinds of evil deeds, which made us deeply resent the army. However, in the early days of liberation, the People's Liberation Army we saw was so disciplined and so kind. Not only did they not take a single needle or thread from the people, but they also helped the weak and aided the poor, blending with the people like milk and water. We told each other: These are Chairman Mao's children, the soldiers cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party! We people have a truly our own army, we feel excited and proud.

We industrialists and businessmen sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army: When the Japanese invaders ravaged most of our country's territory, and the Kuomintang army actively opposed communism and passively resisted Japan, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army led by the Chinese Communist Party resisted the invading army of Japanese imperialism, defended the sacred territory of the motherland, and won the final victory of the War of Resistance. If it were not for the heroic resistance of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, China would never have been able to resist the Japanese invaders for eight years, let alone have the final victory. The safety of our industrialists and businessmen's lives and property is inseparable from the heroic struggle of the People's Liberation Army's predecessor—the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army.

We industrialists and businessmen sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army: We industrialists and businessmen, along with the people of the whole country, were oppressed by the three major enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and the reactionary Kuomintang government, and were in a precarious situation every day. Not only were enterprises likely to go bankrupt at any time, but personal safety was also not guaranteed. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army thoroughly eliminated the three major enemies and the reactionary Kuomintang regime, liberated the whole of China, and rescued the people of the whole country from the abyss of suffering. We industrialists and businessmen were able to get rid of the oppression of the three major enemies, and under the correct policy of the Chinese Communist Party of utilizing, restricting, and transforming us, we accepted socialist transformation and gloriously embarked on the road of socialism.

We industrialists and businessmen sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army: Not long after the founding of New China, American imperialism launched the heinous war of aggression against Korea, attempting to conquer Korea and then subvert our country. Under the call of the Chinese Communist Party, the outstanding soldiers of the People's Liberation Army formed the Chinese People's Volunteers, shouldering the sacred responsibility of resisting America and aiding Korea, and defending the country. The People's Volunteers defeated the many with the few on the Korean battlefield, annihilating thousands upon thousands of enemies, and forcing American imperialism to retreat to the 38th parallel and bow its head to negotiate peace, which created a miracle in the history of world war. We cheer for our most beloved people, the great achievements of the Volunteers will be immortal!

We industrialists and businessmen sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army: The fact that our people can quickly restore the national economy, implement planned economic construction, over fulfill the First Five-Year Plan and successfully prepare to start the Second Five-Year Plan, to establish a solid foundation for our country's industrialization, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, is because the powerful People's Liberation Army has defended our country's sacred territory, and at the same time defended peace in the Far East and the world, enabling our country to carry out socialist construction in a peaceful environment, and gradually transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country. We industrialists and businessmen, along with the people of the whole country, can enjoy an increasingly better and happier life under the socialist system, and we must not forget the People's Liberation Army soldiers cultivated by the Chinese Communist Party.

We industrialists and businessmen sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army: We industrialists and businessmen are transforming from exploiters to laborers, and the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army provide us with a good example for self-transformation. The People's Liberation Army's spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, its heroic, indomitable, and persevering revolutionary heroism, its spirit of overcoming all difficulties and its hard-working and simple style, as well as its tradition of unity and democracy, have given us industrialists and businessmen extremely profound practical education, and are all things that we industrialists and businessmen must study hard in order to transform ourselves.

We industrialists and businessmen sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army: The People's Liberation Army are all good children of Chairman Mao and good soldiers of the Chinese Communist Party. Under the cultivation and education of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, countless immortal heroes and martyrs like Huang Jiguang and Dong Cunrui have emerged. Our children all regard being able to join the People's Liberation Army as the supreme glory, and we are also proud that our children can become a People's Liberation Army soldier. The People's Liberation Army is a fighting force, but also a production army, a good teacher and helpful friend of the masses, and also a school for the greatest collectivist education. The People's Liberation Army is not only famous in the world as an invincible mainstay for safeguarding the cause of peace, but also has set a brilliant example for the people of the whole country in engaging in agricultural and forestry production, helping the people to prevent floods and provide disaster relief, and practicing thrift. Every soldier of the People's Liberation Army has a lofty spirit of patriotism and internationalism and the idea of revolutionary optimism. Many of our children have received the best education in the army, which has given them excellent qualities, and like all the soldiers, they have also become the most beloved people.

Of course, when we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, we will never forget the history of the People's Liberation Army's growth. Our People's Liberation Army has gone from nothing to something, from small to large, from weak to strong, through a long and tortuous road, and finally grown into an invincible force. In these thirty long years, Chairman Mao's children and the Party's soldiers have repeatedly crushed the Kuomintang reactionary army's "encirclement and suppression"; in the unprecedented 25,000-mile Long March, they crossed snow-capped mountains and grasslands, and experienced unimaginable hardships; in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, countless martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed their lives for the liberation and security of the motherland. The fact that our country can be so strong today, and our people can be so happy today, is entirely due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and we must not forget the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army.

At a time when the nationwide anti-rightist struggle is being carried out in depth, celebrating the glorious festival of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army is of even greater significance. The People's Liberation Army has endured countless hardships, sweating and shedding blood, to liberate our country from the enslaved and oppressed semi-feudal and semi-colonial state and embark on the bright socialist road; while the rightists have lost all conscience and are carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracies, trying to drag our country back to the miserable dead end before liberation—the dead end of capitalism, which is something that our people will never tolerate. Remembering the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army's heroic struggle further strengthens our hatred for the rightists, and at the same time inspires our determination to fight against the rightists. We must thoroughly, cleanly, and completely defeat all the reactionary activities of the rightists, in order to commemorate the great festival of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.

Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the great socialist cause!

    我们工商业者衷心感谢人民解放军
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员　陈叔通
    我们全国工商业者和全国人民一起，以满怀兴奋和感激的心情，庆祝中国人民解放军建军三十周年的光辉节日。
    我们工商业者衷心感谢解放军：解放军的伟大精神和优良品质使我们改变了对军队的观感。爱上了人民自己的军队。我们工商业者都经历过军阀的长期内战和国民党的长期榨取，受尽了反动派军队的奸淫掳掠、无恶不作的灾害，使我们对军队感到深恶痛绝。但是，在解放初期，我们看到的人民解放军，纪律是这样的严明，态度是这样的和蔼，不仅不拿人民一针一线，而且扶弱济贫，和人民水乳交融。我们彼此相告：这就是毛主席的子弟，中国共产党教养出来的战士！我们人民有了真正自己的军队，感到兴奋，也感到骄傲。
    我们工商业者衷心感谢解放军：在日寇铁蹄纵横我国大部领土，国民党军队积极反共、消极抗日的时候，中国共产党领导下的八路军和新四军抗御了日本帝国主义的侵略军队，保卫了祖国神圣河山，取得了抗战的最后胜利。如果不是八路军和新四军的英勇抗战，我国决不可能抵抗日寇八年，更不会有最后的胜利。我们工商业者能够保持身家生命的安全，是和解放军的前身——八路军和新四军的英勇奋斗完全分不开的。
    我们工商业者衷心感谢解放军：我们工商业者和全国人民一起，受到帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三大敌人和国民党反动政府的压迫，每天处在风雨飘摇之中，不仅企业随时可能破产，就是人身安全也没有保障。人民解放军在中国共产党领导下，彻底消灭了三大敌人和国民党反动政权，解放了全中国，把全国人民从水深火热之中拯救出来。我们工商业者才摆脱了三大敌人的压迫，在中国共产党对我们的利用、限制和改造的正确政策下，接受了社会主义改造，光荣地走上了社会主义的道路。
    我们工商业者衷心感谢解放军：在新中国成立不久，美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的罪恶战争，企图征服朝鲜，进而颠覆我国。人民解放军的优秀战士在中国共产党的号召下，组成了中国人民志愿军，担负起抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣责任。人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上以寡胜众，歼灭了成千成万的敌人后，逼使美帝国主义不得不退到三八线，俯首议和，更是创造了世界战史上的奇迹。我们为我们的最可爱的人欢呼，志愿军的丰功伟业将永垂千秋！
    我们工商业者衷心感谢解放军：我们全国人民在中国共产党领导下能够迅速地恢复国民经济，实行有计划的经济建设，并且超额完成第一个五年计划，胜利地准备开始第二个五年计划，建立我国工业化的巩固的基础，就是由于强大的解放军保卫了我国神圣的领土，同时也就保卫了远东和世界和平，使我国能够在和平的环境中进行社会主义建设，逐步把我国由落后的农业国改变为先进的社会主义的工业国家。我们工商业者和全国人民一起，能够在社会主义制度下享受越来越美好的幸福生活，决不能忘记中国共产党培养出来的解放军战士。
    我们工商业者衷心感谢解放军：我们工商业者正由剥削者向劳动者转变中，人民解放军的优良传统，为我们进行自我改造提供了良好的范例。人民解放军的全心全意为人民服务的精神，英勇顽强、坚忍不拔的革命英雄主义的气概，克服一切困难和艰苦朴素的作风，以及团结、民主的传统，给予了我们工商业者极为深刻的现实的教育，都是我们工商业者为了改造自己而必须好好地学习的。
    我们工商业者衷心感谢解放军：人民解放军都是毛主席的好子弟，中国共产党的好战士，在毛主席和共产党的培养教育下，产生了无数的像黄继光、董存瑞这样千古不朽的英雄烈士。我们的子女都以能够参加解放军为无上的光荣，我们也以我们的子女能够成为一个解放军战士而感到骄傲。解放军是战斗的部队，也是生产的大军，是群众的良师益友，也是一个最伟大的集体主义教育的学校。解放军不仅以一个不可战胜的、保卫和平事业的中流砥柱著名于世界，而且在从事农林生产，帮助人民防汛救灾以及厉行节约等各方面，也都给全国人民做出了光辉的榜样。解放军战士人人都具有崇高的爱国主义和国际主义的精神和革命的乐观主义的思想。我们很多人的子女在部队中受到了最好的教育，使他们具有优良品质，和所有战士一样，也都成为最可爱的人。
    自然，我们庆祝解放军建军三十周年纪念，决不会忘记解放军成长的历史。我们的人民解放军从无到有，从小到大，从弱到强，经过一条漫长曲折的道路，终于生长壮大成为一支不可战胜的力量。在这三十年的漫长岁月中，毛主席的子弟，党的战士，曾经多次粉碎了国民党反动军队的“围剿”；在史无前例的二万五千里长征中，过雪山、越草原，经历了难以想像的千辛万苦；在抗日战争、解放战争以及抗美援朝战争中，更不知有多少烈士，为了祖国的解放和安全，流尽了自己的鲜血，牺牲了自己的生命。我们的国家能够有今日这样强盛，我国的人民能够有今日这样的幸福，完全应该归功于中国共产党的领导，完全不能忘记人民解放军的伟大业绩。
    在全国正在深入展开反右派斗争的时候，我们庆祝人民解放军建军三十周年的光荣的节日，更具有重大的意义。人民解放军经受了说不尽的艰苦，流汗流血，把我国从被奴役、被压迫的半封建半殖民地中解放出来，走上了光明的社会主义道路；而右派分子丧尽良心，进行反党反社会主义的阴谋活动，却想把我国拉回到解放前的悲惨死路——资本主义的死路上去，这是我们全国人民决不能容忍的。想起解放军英勇奋斗的伟大业绩，更加增强了我们对右派分子的愤恨，同时也鼓舞了我们对右派分子斗争的决心。我们一定要彻底、干净、完全击溃所有右派分子的反动活动，用以纪念人民解放军建军三十周年的伟大节日。
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的社会主义事业万岁！
