(Reported by this newspaper) A compilation of news from the Shandong Dazhong Daily and Qingdao Daily: Faculty and students of Shandong University and members of the Qingdao branch of the September 3rd Society have been holding meetings for the past half-month to expose and condemn Lu Kanru, Vice President of Shandong University and Chairman of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the September 3rd Society, for his fallacies and conspiratorial activities against the leadership of the Party and against socialism.

Lu Kanru, this sanctimonious scholar, literary historian, director of the Writers Association, and member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), has gradually exposed his true colors as a bourgeois rightist during this period of great airing of views and debates. He started fires everywhere, shooting poisonous arrows at the Party; he attempted to use the September 3rd Society and Shandong University as a base to organize a team to launch a frenzied attack on the Party.

Using a Falsified Record of Chairman Mao's Speech to Start Fires Everywhere

Like all rightists, Lu Kanru was most enthusiastic about opposing the leadership of the Party. In Qingdao, he was the first to shout the slogan "Abolish the Party Committee System in Schools."

On June 2nd, at a so-called democratic school management forum jointly held by the Shandong University and Qingdao Medical College branches of the "September 3rd Society," he viciously attacked the legitimacy of the Party's leadership at the outset of his speech. He said, "I don't know much about the Party committee system. In the past, the Ministry of Higher Education did not have a clear stipulation, nor did I see any formal documents." He also said, "The Party committee system and the 'three evils' are not two separate things, but are mutually cause and effect." He distorted the Party's leadership as the personal leadership of the Party committee secretary. The so-called mutual cause and effect meant that if the Party committee was not abolished, the "three evils" would never be eradicated. This "brilliant idea" was in the same vein as the fallacies of "Party's world" and "the three evils are produced by the people's democratic dictatorship system."

Someone criticized his fallacy as poisonous weeds, which immediately angered this "scholar." In his article "My Views on the School's Party Committee System" published in "New Shandong University," he said that those who criticized him "never dreamed that this so-called 'poisonous weed' was planted by Chairman Mao himself."

After repeated investigations, Lu Kanru had to admit that this was written based on a falsified record of Chairman Mao's speech. This record was introduced to him by Chen Yangzhi, the rightist and Deputy Chairman of the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. Later, the Municipal Committee of the Democratic League sent the third issue of the "Study Bulletin" published by the League's Municipal Committee, which contained this record. Lu Kanru also admitted that at that time, he thought this record "hit the nail on the head."

Lu Kanru printed this falsified record of the speech as it was, distributed it, started fires everywhere, and organized all members of Shandong University and Qingdao Medical College to discuss it. He also sent this record to the Preparatory Committee of the September 3rd Society's Jinan Branch. The Jinan Branch and the Qingdao Branch of the September 3rd Society were parallel organizations, but he said in the official letter: "Print and circulate it widely as soon as possible." Huang Shaoming, the Secretary-General of the Jinan Branch, felt as if he had found a treasure after seeing the official letter and record. He truly played the role of starting a fire.

Backstage Commander of the Anti-Communist Rightist Publication "Democracy Newspaper"

The "Democracy Newspaper," edited by the Shandong University branch of the September 3rd Society, was a distinct rightist publication that opposed the leadership of the Party and opposed socialism. The articles it published focused on attacking the Party committee and the Party committee system, and went to extremes in distorting, slandering, and cursing. The inaugural speech stated the purpose of the publication was to: "Expose the contradictions between the Party and the masses, as well as the mistakes made in the anti-three, ideological remolding, especially in the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, to help and supervise the Party to do a good job in redressing injustices and summarizing the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, to tear down walls and fill ditches, and to promote unity;" "Expose the shortcomings of the Party committee system in our school, and discuss plans for running the school well, etc." What kind of smell is this? On the first page of the first issue was printed Lu Kanru's speech at the so-called "democratic school management" forum jointly held by the Shandong University and Qingdao Medical College branches of the September 3rd Society. The original title was "My Views on the School's Party Committee System," but Lu Kanru felt that the title of his proud masterpiece was not clear enough, and personally changed it to "I Support Abolishing the Party Committee System in Schools." As Zhan Yuanji, a member of the September 3rd Society, said, this speech to abolish the Party committee system was essentially a program he put forward for the "Democracy Newspaper." Liu Hongbin, the rightist who presided over the "Democracy Newspaper," confessed at the faculty and staff meeting of the Physics Department held by the Shandong University Trade Union that the decision to transform the big-character posters into the Democracy Newspaper (the predecessor of the Democracy Newspaper was big-character posters) was decided after a meeting of the Shandong University Branch of the September 3rd Society, and the chairman of this meeting was Lu Kanru. Under the chairmanship of Lu Kanru, the Standing Committee of the Qingdao Branch of the September 3rd Society also passed a resolution to incorporate the "Democracy Newspaper" into the branch's "Newsletter." Li Zhongyi, a member of the editorial board of the "Democracy Newspaper," also revealed that Liu Hongbin had told him that after three or four issues of the "Democracy Newspaper," it would be changed to letterpress printing and distributed in Qingdao. A letterpress newspaper has people, money, and support.

Isn't it clear who the behind-the-scenes boss of the "Democracy Newspaper" is?

Holding Back the Qingdao Branch in Resisting the Anti-Rightist Struggle

Lu Kanru's conspiratorial activities under the guise of "helping the Party rectify its work style" had a set of strategies.

At the beginning of the airing of views and debates, Lu Kanru and the September 3rd Society he led, down to the grassroots organizations, were very active. People like Liu Hongbin and Chen Jishu can be said to have been quite arrogant. They colluded with other rightists such as Shu Xingbei from Shandong University, to conspire to launch a major offensive. Liu Hongbin presided over the "Democracy Newspaper," calling out: "Young comrades, let's fight!" "The light is coming!" They launched multiple attacks on Associate Professor Lu Guangting for saying a fair word: "We must prevent unhealthy trends." In addition to seizing on the fundamental goal of opposing the Party's leadership, Lu Kanru also specially formed a "core group" to support anti-Party speeches and ensure "no retaliation."

However, after the People's Daily editorial "Why Is This?" was published, Lu Kanru's attitude immediately became passive. The "Democracy Newspaper," which had been rampant for a while, was suspended. After a perfunctory expanded meeting of the branch committee was held on June 13th to criticize the rightists, it simply remained silent for half a month. During this period, someone suggested holding a meeting to criticize the rightists, but Lu Kanru simply ignored it. At the so-called meeting to criticize the rightists on June 13th, Lu Kanru even defended Chu Anping's "Party's world," saying, "It can be interpreted as 'the world belongs to the Party,' or it can be interpreted as 'the Party is for the world.'"

Responding to Chu Anping's Calls

Lu Kanru's defense of Chu Anping was not without reason. It turned out that Lu Kanru and Chu Anping had been in contact for a long time. Chu had been to Qingdao, and Lu Kanru also met with Chu when he went to Beijing for meetings. Until the beginning of June, Chu even wrote a personal letter inviting Lu Kanru to write for the Guangming Daily. According to the Dazhong Daily report on July 1st, Lu Kanru had given strong support to Chu Anping's activities of attacking the Party. Under the entrustment of Chu Anping in two letters, Lu Kanru convened a symposium of members of democratic parties in Qingdao in the name of the Guangming Daily editorial department. At this meeting, Chen Yangzhi, Xu Yiguan and others made many anti-communist and anti-socialist fallacies. The meeting records occupied an entire page of the Guangming Daily on June 5th. At that time, there was only one assistant reporter from Guangming Daily attending the meeting. This symposium was organized single-handedly by Lu Kanru at the behest of Chu Anping.

Recruiting Troops and Buying Horses to Cultivate Cronies

Zhao Shengzhi, professor of the Chinese Department of Shandong University and Deputy Secretary-General of the September 3rd Society, said in his confession about his relationship with Lu Kanru: After Lu Kanru returned from a series of meetings in Beijing in April this year, he first wanted to expand the organization. Not only in this city, but also planned to establish directly affiliated groups in Yantai and Weifang. Lu Kanru also planned to establish a provincial-level organization of the "September 3rd Society" and let the Jinan branch go to Qufu to develop organizations and establish directly affiliated groups. At the same time, Lu Kanru had preliminary plans for how many members would be in the provincial-level organization and the distribution of candidates, and he had cultivated his cronies in various places, wanting to be the head when the provincial-level organization was established.

Zhao Shengzhi also said that in order to create a false impression, when the Qingdao Branch was re-elected, there were less than 170 members, but Lu Kanru advocated electing 50 members, so that he could win over more people to work for him. He also instructed the branch to specially collect materials on the so-called inadequate coverage of the September 3rd Society's activities by the Qingdao Daily and complained to the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attempting to use the Party newspaper to publicize the activities of the September 3rd Society in a big way in order to expand its influence. At a meeting of the Shandong University branch, Liu Hongbin revealed that Lu Kanru was very active in developing members, and once told him that counter-revolutionaries could also be developed.

Great Popular Indignation Continues to Pursue and Attack

After Lu Kanru's rampant words and deeds of attacking the Party were exposed, there was great popular indignation. At the Shandong University Faculty of Arts and Sciences conference on July 9th, Professor Tong Shuye severely refuted Lu Kanru's sinister attempt to abolish the Party's leadership.

The rectification committee of the Qingdao Branch of the September 3rd Society continued to investigate Lu Kanru at its first expanded meeting held on July 11th. Faced with the facts presented by everyone, Lu Kanru admitted some things and evaded many others. Everyone asked him to continue to examine and confess his problems in depth.

    道貌岸然的“学者”原来是野心勃勃的阴谋家
    陆侃如想把“九三”分社变成反共司令部
    山东大学师生和分社成员群起反击　右派的美梦破灭了
    本报讯　综合山东大众日报和青岛日报消息：山东大学的师生和九三学社青岛分社的成员，在最近半个月来，连日开会揭露和斥责山东大学副校长、九三学社青岛市主任委员陆侃如的反对党的领导、反对社会主义的谬论和阴谋活动。
    陆侃如，这位道貌岸然的学者、文学史家、作家协会理事、全国政协委员，在这次大鸣大放中，逐渐暴露了自己的资产阶级右派分子的真面目。他四处点火，向党放出毒箭；他妄图以九三学社和山东大学为阵地，组织起一支向党猖狂进攻的队伍。
    利用被篡改了的毛主席讲话记录到处放火
    和所有右派分子一样，陆侃如最热心的是反对党的领导。在青岛，他第一个喊出了“取消学校里的党委制”的口号。
    6月2日，他在“九三”山东大学和青岛医学院支社联合召开的所谓民主办校座谈会上讲话，一开头就恶毒地攻击党的领导的合法性。他说：“关于党委制我知道的不多，过去高教部没有明文规定，也没有见正式文件”。又说，“党委制与三害不是两回事，而是互为因果。”他把党的领导，曲解为党委书记个人领导。所谓互为因果，即是党委会不撤销，“三害”就永远除不掉。这个“高见”与“党天下”和“三害产生于人民民主专政制度”的谬论是异曲同工的。
    有人批评他的这种谬论是毒草，一下触怒了这位“学者”，他在“新山大”发表的“我对学校党委制的看法”一文中说批评他的人“做梦也没想到这棵所谓‘毒草’还是毛主席亲手种下的”。
    经过多次追查，陆侃如才不得不说出这是根据一份被篡改了的毛主席讲话记录稿写的。而这份记录稿则是右派分子民盟青岛市副主任委员陈仰之介绍给他的。以后民盟市委送来刊有这一记录稿的盟市委出版的“学习简报”第三期。陆侃如也承认，当时他就认为这个记录稿“正中下怀”。
    陆侃如拿到这份被篡改了的讲话记录稿，就照样打印，往下分发，四处点火，并且组织山大和青岛医学院全体社员进行讨论。他还把这份记录稿发给九三济南分社筹委会。九三济南分社和青岛分社是平行的组织，而他却在公函中说：“尽速翻印，普遍传达”。而济南分社秘书长黄绍鸣见到公函和记录稿后，“如获至宝”，他真正起了点火的作用。
    幕后指挥反共的右派刊物“民主报”
    九三山东大学支社主编的“民主报”，是一个鲜明的反对党的领导、反社会主义的右派刊物，所载文章都是集中攻击党委和党委制，极尽其歪曲、诬蔑、谩骂之能事。发刊辞中说明了该刊的宗旨是：“揭露党群间的矛盾，以及三反、思想改造，特别在肃反运动中发生的错误，帮助和监督党作好平反工作和肃反总结，拆墙填沟，搞好团结；”“揭露党委制在我校所存在的缺点，讨论办好学校方案等问题。”试问这是一股什么气味？而在第一期第一页上印的正是陆侃如在九三山东大学和青岛医学院支社联合召开的所谓“民主办校”座谈会上的讲话稿，原标题是“我对学校党委制的看法”，陆侃如嫌他这篇得意杰作的标题不明确，曾亲笔改为“我赞成撤销学校里的党委制”。正如九三学社社员詹元吉说的，这个取消党委制的讲话，实质上是他为“民主报”提出的一个纲领。“民主报”的主持者右派分子刘鸿宾在山东大学工会召开的物理系教职员会议上交代，关于大字报转为民主报（民主报的前身原是大字报），是经过九三山东大学支社会议讨论决定的，这次会议的主持人就是陆侃如。九三分社常委会在陆侃如的主持下，还通过了一项决议，要把“民主报”并入分社的“社讯”。“民主报”编委李仲益还揭发刘鸿宾曾对他说：“民主报”出三、四期后要改为铅印，要在青岛市内发行。铅印报是有人、有钱、有支持的。
    “民主报”的后台老板是谁，还不清楚吗？把持青岛分社抗拒反右派斗争陆侃如在“帮助党整风”的幌子下，进行的阴谋活动，是有他一套战略的。
    鸣放一开始，陆侃如和他们领导的九三分社直至基层组织，是非常活跃的。其中像刘鸿宾、陈继述等人，可以说是相当嚣张，他们与山东大学的其他右派分子束星北等相勾结，共谋大举进攻。刘鸿宾主持“民主报”，号召：“青年同志们战斗起来吧！”“光明就要来临！”他们对于说了一句“要防止歪风邪气”公道话的陆光庭副教授，多方进行打击。陆侃如除了抓住反对党的领导这一根本目标以外，还专门组成“核心小组”，为反党言论撑腰，保证“不受打击报复”。
    可是当人民日报社论“这是为什么？”发表后，陆侃如的态度马上变得消极起来。猖狂一时的“民主报”停刊了。批判右派的事情，自从6月13日马马虎虎地开了一次分社委员扩大会以后，就干脆偃旗息鼓，保持缄默达半月之久。其间曾有人建议开会批判右派，陆侃如竟置之不理。就在6月13日那次所谓批判右派的会上，陆侃如竟然挺身为储安平的“党天下”辩护，说什么“可以解释为‘天下为党’，也可以解释为‘党为天下’”。
    同储安平此呼彼应
    陆侃如为储安平辩护，是言出有因的。原来，陆侃如和储安平早有联系。储来过青岛，陆侃如去北京开会也与储见面。直至6月初，储还亲笔写信约陆侃如为光明日报写稿。据7月1日大众日报报道：陆侃如对储安平向党进攻的活动，曾作了有力的支持。在储安平的两次书信委托下，陆侃如用光明日报编辑部名义在青岛召开民主党派成员座谈会。在这个会上，陈仰之、徐一贯等发表了许多反共、反社会主义谬论。会议记录占了6月5日光明日报的一整版。当时光明日报参加会的，只有一个助理记者。这次座谈会是陆侃如受储安平之托一手包办的。
    招兵买马培养亲信
    山东大学中文系教授、九三分社副秘书长赵省之在交代同陆侃如的关系时，说：陆侃如从今年4月在北京开了一系列会议回来后，首先要扩大发展组织。不仅在本市，并且还计划在烟台、潍坊成立直属小组。陆侃如还计划成立“九三”的省级组织，并让济南分社到曲阜去发展组织，成立直属小组。同时，陆侃如对于成立省级组织后设多少委员及人选分配，都有了初步计划，而且在各地都培养了他的亲信，想在省级组织成立时由他当头子。
    赵省之还说到，为了虚张声势，在青岛分社改选时，社员不到一百七十名，陆侃如主张选举五十名委员，也好多拉拢一些人为他卖力。他还责成分社专门收集一些所谓青岛日报对九三分社活动报道不够的材料，到中共青岛市委去控告，企图利用党报大肆宣扬九三分社的活动，以扩大影响。在山东大学支社的一次会上，刘鸿宾谈出：陆侃如发展社员很积极，曾对他说过，反革命分子也可以发展。
    群情激愤继续追击
    陆侃如猖狂向党进攻的言行被揭露出来之后，群情激愤。在7月9日山东大学文科师生大会上，童书业教授严厉驳斥了陆侃如企图取消党的领导的罪恶企图。
    九三青岛分社整风委员会，在7月11日召开的首次扩大会议上，继续追查陆侃如。陆侃如在大家摆出的事实面前，承认了一些，逃避了许多。大家要他继续深入检查和交代问题。
