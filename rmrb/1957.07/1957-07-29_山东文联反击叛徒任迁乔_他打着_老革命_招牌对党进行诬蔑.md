Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th: Since July 9th, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has continuously used various methods to refute the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of Ren Qianqiao, a rightist within the Party.

Ren Qianqiao is a Communist Party member and the director of the Art Department of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles. During the "Great Blooming and Great Contending" campaign, he shamelessly betrayed the Party, wielding the banner of "old revolutionary" to slander that there was no democracy inside or outside the Party, and to slander that the Party and the Party Central Committee had committed serious errors but refused to make self-criticism. He said that "the cult of personality has become a system" within the Party, and "Why can we shout 'Long Live Chairman Mao,' but not 'Long Live Gao Gang and Rao Shushi'?" He even spoke up for Gao Gang.

Ren Qianqiao was extremely opposed to the struggle against the rightists, and slandered that the Chinese Communist Party was not even as good as the Kuomintang. On the organization's blackboard newspaper, he continuously published three cartoons that slandered and insulted the Party.

After a stern struggle, faced with the large number of facts that were exposed, Ren Qianqiao only admitted and confessed to some of his reactionary words and deeds, but still maintained a dishonest attitude of minimizing the severity and reducing the magnitude of his offenses, avoiding discussing his serious reactionary words and deeds that slandered the Party and the Party's leaders. The Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has decided to convene a meeting of literary and art circles in Shandong Province and Jinan City in the near future to continue exposing and refuting Ren Qianqiao's reactionary words and deeds.

    山东文联反击叛徒任迁乔
    他打着“老革命”招牌对党进行诬蔑
    新华社济南28日电　山东省文学艺术工作者联合会自7月9日以来，连续通过各种方式，驳斥党内右派分子任迁乔的反党反社会主义言行。
    任迁乔是共产党员，是省文联艺术部部长。他在“大放大鸣”当中无耻地背叛了党，打着“老革命”的招牌，污蔑党内党外根本没有民主，污蔑党和党中央犯了严重的错误又不作自我批评，说党内“个人崇拜成了系统”、“为什么能喊毛主席万岁，就不能喊高岗、饶漱石万岁？”他还为高岗喊冤。
    任迁乔极端反对反击右派的斗争，诽谤中国共产党还不如国民党。在机关黑板报上，他曾经连续发表了污蔑谩骂党的三幅漫画。
    经过严正的斗争，任迁乔在被揭发的大量事实面前，只承认和交代了自己的一些反动言行，但还是抱着避重就轻、化大为小的不老实态度，对于污蔑党和党的领袖的严重反动言行避而不谈。省文联决定最近召开山东省及济南市文艺界会议，继续对任迁乔的反动言行进行揭发和驳斥。
