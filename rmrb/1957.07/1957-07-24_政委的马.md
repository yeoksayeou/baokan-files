    The Political Commissar's Horse
    Wei Yan
    On the march,
    Dark clouds gradually rise,
    Suddenly, thunder and lightning,
    Then, a downpour…
    By a small river,
    I saw the political commissar's big red horse;
    I said: Comrade Political Commissar,
    Raise the horse's reins a bit.
    Who knew the answer,
    Was the battalion headquarters' little messenger.
    I asked: Where is the political commissar?
    The little devil blinked his eyes,
    And said very shyly:
    I got blisters on my feet,
    Falling behind the team,
    The political commissar saw me,
    And insisted on pulling me up on top.
    He also said:
    "Little devil, be careful not to fall,
    Pull the reins tight."

    政委的马
    卫雁
    行军路上，
    乌云渐渐升起，
    突然间，雷鸣闪电，
    接着，暴雨倾泄……
    在一条小河旁，
    我看见政委的大红马；
    我说：政委同志呀，
    把马的缰绳抬高点。
    那知回答的，
    却是营部的小通讯员。
    我问：政委呢？
    小鬼?了?眼，
    说得很腼腆：
    我脚上打了泡，
    掉在队伍的后面，
    叫政委看见了，
    硬把我拖在上边。
    他还说：
    “小鬼，注意别摔了，
    把缰绳拉紧点。”
