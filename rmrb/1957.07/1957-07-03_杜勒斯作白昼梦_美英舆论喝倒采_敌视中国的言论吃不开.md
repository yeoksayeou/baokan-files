Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 2nd - Democratic Senator Humphrey of the United States criticized Dulles' recent speech hostile to the People's Republic of China on the 1st, believing it showed that American policy was based on fantasy. He said that Dulles believed that "communist rule" in China was a "transient rather than a permanent phenomenon," which was an "overly optimistic" idea, just as he said two years ago that the Soviet Union was on the "verge of collapse."

Senator Magnuson also believes that "it is necessary to re-examine" Dulles' China policy because this policy is "so rigid." He specifically pointed out that the United States cannot effectively prohibit trade with China forever.

The "New York Post" said on June 29 that the China policy pursued by Dulles was "both unrealistic and inconsistent with the pace of American allies." Dulles' hope that the Chinese government will collapse is "daydreaming" and "wishful thinking."

Xinhua News Agency, London, 2nd - British newspapers continue to criticize US Secretary of State Dulles' anti-China speech delivered in San Francisco on June 28.

The Edinburgh newspaper "The Scotsman" commented on Saturday that the arguments in Dulles' speech were weak. The real reasons for the US policy toward China are: first, for strategic needs, it hopes to maintain the base in Taiwan; second, if the United States abandons its extremely hostile attitude toward China, it will lose prestige.

The Liverpool "Daily Post" said on Saturday: Dulles' major policy statement resulted in great disappointment, and this is not the first time.

    杜勒斯作白昼梦
    美英舆论喝倒采
    敌视中国的言论吃不开
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国民主党参议员汉弗1日抨击杜勒斯最近发表的敌视中华人民共和国的演说，认为它表明美国的政策是建基在空想之上的。他说，杜勒斯认为“共产主义的统治”在中国是一种“要消逝的，而不是一种永久的现象”，这是一种“过分乐观”的想法，正如他在两年前说苏联已经到了“瓦解的边缘”一样。
    参议员麦格纳逊也认为“有必要重新审查”杜勒斯的对华政策，因为这个政策是“如此僵硬”。他特别指出，美国是不能永远有效地禁止同中国的贸易的。
    “纽约邮报”6月29日说，杜勒斯推行的对华政策是“既不现实，又和美国盟国的步调不一致”。杜勒斯盼望中国政府垮台，这是“白日作梦”和“喜欢妄想”。
    据新华社伦敦2日电　英国报纸继续批评美国国务卿杜勒斯6月28日在旧金山发表的敌视中国的演说。
    爱丁堡报纸“苏格兰人报”星期六评论说，杜勒斯演说中的论据是软弱无力的。美国对华政策的真正的原因是：一，为了战略上的需要，希望保持台湾的基地；二，如果美国放弃极端敌视中国的态度，它将会丧失威信。
    利物浦“每日邮报”星期六说：杜勒斯的重大政策声明结果使人大为失望，这次已经不是第一次了。
