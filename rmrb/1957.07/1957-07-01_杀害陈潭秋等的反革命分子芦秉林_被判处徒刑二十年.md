This newspaper, Lanzhou, 29th: On the afternoon of June 28th, the Lanzhou Municipal People's Court publicly tried the counter-revolutionary element Lu Binglin (original name Lu Qingfu), who murdered Chen Tanqiu, Mao Zemin, Lin Jilu, and others, and sentenced the criminal to twenty years imprisonment, with five years deprivation of political rights.

Lu Binglin confessed that in August and September of 1943, the Sheng Shicai bandits carried out a mass slaughter of our revolutionary martyrs. At that time, the criminal Lu was an official in the Second Prison of the pseudo-Xinjiang Provincial Public Security Administration. Under the command of special agent heads Li Yingqi, Zhang Guangqian, and Liu Bingde, he and several other executioners personally strangled our Party Central Committee member and Party representative stationed in Xinjiang Province, Chen Tanqiu, Xinjiang Finance Department Director Mao Zemin, and Xinjiang College Dean Lin Jilu, and other comrades with ropes. Progressive figures Zang Gufeng, Chen Xiuying, and ten others were also murdered at the same time. From 1940 to 1944, the Sheng bandits' Second Prison successively killed more than 300 people, including Communist Party members, democrats, and innocent people. In these counter-revolutionary activities, the criminal Lu always served as an executioner or was responsible for cleaning up the execution ground and eliminating corpses.
