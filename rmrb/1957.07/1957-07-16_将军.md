    General
    Peng Jingfeng
    In the evening, we were walking on the newly built road in the suburbs. A gloomy dark cloud was chasing closely behind us, and soon it caught up with us, darkening half of the sky. Under the cover of the dark cloud, a whirlwind mixed with a sudden rainstorm swept over us, stirring up sand and stones on the road, and the green willows on both sides were bent to one side. Only we were still walking in the wind and rain. It was worth getting wet to attend a wonderful evening party tonight.
    Just as the raindrops started to fall on our clothes, a burst of rapid horn sounds came from behind. A green jeep caught up with us. We dodged to the side of the road, but the car stopped, and a familiar voice came from inside: "Are you going to the party? Get in!"
    We looked back and saw a major general sitting in the car.
    The major general was a military region leader we were quite familiar with. He didn't have the intimidating authority of a general. Seeing the kind smile that often appeared on his face, and his gentle and refined demeanor, who would have thought that he was a battle-hardened general who had shaken the frontier? We young people all loved to be around him. He often told us stories of his battles during the revolutionary war and patiently listened to our writing plans....
    At this time, it was completely dark, and the rain was getting heavier and heavier. The heavy rain was mixed with thunder and lightning. The jeep was running on the bumpy road, and raindrops splashed in bursts, wetting the general's clothes. We remembered that a few days ago, the logistics department had bought a brand-new blue minibus for him to use, but why wasn't he using it? When we asked about this, the general smiled, "That's a waste, I returned it to them."
    Although the general's words were so plain, our hearts couldn't help but be moved. Why was the general so frugal! Two days ago, we heard that in order to help solve the housing difficulties of the机关 (organizations directly under the Communist Party of China), he gave up part of the small western-style building he lived in....
    We didn't know what to say to him, so we just said, "You're not in good health, you should try to live more comfortably."
      "No, I can't excuse myself like that." The general seriously interrupted us. He lit a cigarette, calmly exhaled a puff of smoke, and then said, "We should always remember the hard past. During the Long March, I relied on my two legs to complete those tens of thousands of miles! Once, during a night breakout, I was injured and couldn't walk, so I completely relied on our commander (he was our regimental commander) to carry me. At that time, it was impossible to find a horse to ride. Now that we have a jeep to ride in, can we still be dissatisfied?"
    The jeep was still speeding in the rain. At a sharp turn in an alley, it overtook four people riding bicycles. It seemed that one of them wasn't riding very well, wobbling. When the car passed, they dodged to the side and almost hit a telephone pole. The general stopped talking and said to the driver, "Slow down, watch out for pedestrians."
    When the car arrived at the entrance of the theater, it was already crowded with cars and people. The general got out of the car and habitually glanced at the row of parked cars, saying to the people next to him, "Why hasn't the commander arrived yet?"
    He stood at the entrance of the theater waiting. On this windy and rainy night, there were few pedestrians on the street, only the dim streetlights were swaying sadly in the wind and rain. After waiting for a long time, there wasn't a single car in sight. Only four people riding bicycles rode towards the theater. The general remembered that they were the same people he had met earlier, and smiled at us again: "They are also here to attend the party. In such heavy rain, riding a bicycle is more difficult than me sitting in a jeep!"
    Before he finished speaking, the four people had arrived at the entrance of the theater. One of them, while getting off his bicycle, asked, "Where do we park the bikes? Is there a storage fee?"
    As soon as he heard this familiar voice, the major general immediately ran down the steps in the rain, exclaiming in surprise, "Commander, why are you riding a bicycle?"
    The commander, while unbuttoning his raincoat, said with a smile, "What's the big deal! It's not much different from riding a horse...."
    The major general helped the commander up the slippery steps with concern. The two of them walked into the theater, talking and laughing intimately.
    The people at the entrance were stunned. If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, who would have believed that this person riding a bicycle was our commander-in-chief?
    After the party, we got into the major general's jeep again. He rarely spoke along the way, only constantly smoking. From the flash of light when he lit the match, we saw his thoughtful face, just like he was deeply thinking in front of a military map during the war. After a long while, he said to us, "Everyone should often examine themselves. Sometimes, you think you're already very good, but after an examination, you're still far from it! Comrades, you are still very young, you should pay more attention!"
    The next morning, as I walked into the gate of the barracks, a bicycle rang its bell and caught up with me from behind. Before I could turn around to look, the bicycle had already sped ahead; the rising sun shone on the cyclist, and I saw a golden star shining brightly on his shoulder.

    将军
    彭荆风
    傍晚，我们走在城郊那条新辟的大道上，一块阴森森的乌云，紧紧在后边追赶着，一会儿就撵到了我们头顶上，把半边天都遮得发暗了。在乌云的掩护下，旋风夹着急骤的雨点斜扑过来，卷起了路上的沙石，两旁的青青杨柳也歪向一边。只有我们还在冒着风雨走着。为了赶去参加今夜一个精彩的晚会，淋雨也值得。
    当雨点刚淋到我们的衣服上时，后边响起了一阵急骤的喇叭声，一辆绿色小吉普车追了上来，我们往路旁一闪躲，车子却停住了，一个熟悉的声音从车内传出来：“是去参加晚会么？上来吧！”
    我们回头一看，车内坐着一位少将同志。
    少将是我们比较熟悉的一位军区首长。他身上没有那种使人畏惧的将军威严，看到那经常显现在脸上的慈祥笑容；那温文尔雅的风度，谁能想到，他就是一位身经百战，威震边陲的将军呢？我们这些年青人都爱和他接近，他常常和我们讲述他在革命战争中的战斗故事。耐心地倾听我们的写作计划……。
    这时，天色已完全黑了，雨也下得越来越大了，急雨中还夹杂着响雷和闪电，小吉普车在坎坷不平的马路上奔跑着，雨点一阵阵地飘进来，把将军的衣服都溅湿了。我们想起来，前些日子，后勤部门曾买了一辆崭新的蓝色小包车送给他用，他怎么不坐呢？当我们问起这事时，将军却笑了笑，“那是浪费，我退回给他们了。”
    将军的语句虽然那样平淡，我们的心不禁都激动起来了，将军为什么要这样俭朴呵！前两天，我们就听说，他为了帮助解决机关住房的困难，把自己住的那座小洋楼让出了一部分来……。
    我们不知道该怎么对他说，只好说道：“你身体不太好，尽可能还是过得舒适一些。”
      “不，不能这样原谅自己。”将军严肃地打断了我们的话头。他燃起了一支香烟，从容地吐出了一口烟圈后，才说道：“我们应该时常记住那艰苦的过去，长征的时候，我就是依靠两条腿走完那几万里路的呢！有一次黑夜突围中，我受了伤走不动了，就完全依靠我们司令员背着我走（他是我们的团长），那时，想找一匹骑的马都不可能，现在有了这吉普车坐，还能不满足么？”
    吉普车还在雨地里急驶着，在一个急拐弯的巷口上超过了四辆骑自行车的人，看来，其中有个人的车子骑得并不好，摇摇晃晃的，汽车驶过时，他们往旁边一闪，几乎撞到了路旁的电线杆上，将军停住了话语，对驾驶员说了一句：“慢点，注意行人。”
    车子到了剧场门口，那里已是车如流水，挤满人了，将军下了车，习惯地向那一排停着的小汽车扫了一眼，对旁边的人说道：“司令员怎么还没来？”
    他就站在剧场的门口等候着。这大风雨的晚上，街道上的行人很少，只有昏暗的街灯在风雨中凄凉地摇晃着。等了好一会，都不见一辆汽车的影子，只有四个骑自行车的人向剧场这边驰了过来，将军还记得是刚才遇见的那几个人，又笑着对我们道：他们也是来参加晚会的。这么大的雨，坐自行车比我坐吉普车总要辛苦一些吧！”
    话没说完，那四个人已来到剧场门口了，其中一个人，一边下车，一边问道：“车子靠在那里呀？收不收寄存费呀！”
    一听到这熟悉的声音，少将立即冒着雨从台阶上跑了下去，惊讶地喊着：“司令员同志，你怎么骑自行车了？”
    司令员一边解雨衣的扣子，一边笑着说道：“这有什么关系嘛！这还不是和骑马差不多。……”
    少将关心地搀扶着司令员走上那泥滑的台阶，他俩亲热地说笑着走进了剧场。
    门口的人都被惊得目瞪口呆了，要不是亲眼看见的，谁能一下就相信，这位骑自行车的人，就是我们的上将司令员同志呢？
    晚会散了后，我们又坐进了少将同志的吉普车，一路上，他很少说话，只是不断地吸着烟，从他擦燃火柴亮光一闪中，我们看到了他那若有所思的脸孔，就像他在战争中对着军事地图深思一样。过了好一会，他才对我们说了一句：“每一个人都要常常检查自己，有的时候，你自己以为已经很不错了，但一检查还是差得很远呢！同志，你们还很年轻，更要注意呀！”
    第二天早上，我刚走进营房的大门，一辆自行车响着铃当从我身后追了上来，我还来不及回头看时，车子已驰到前边去了；初升的太阳，照着骑车人，我看见了一颗金星在他肩上放射着灿烂的光芒。
