    Colored Stone Inlay

    The colored stone inlay made of Qingtian stone has only about forty or fifty years of history, and it has a different style and originality from other inlays in China.

    Artisans use the various natural colors of Qingtian stone, saw them into thin slices, and piece them together, carving and inlaying various flowers, birds, figures, and landscapes. The colors are beautiful, and the lines are flexible. Fine details can represent willow branches, and rough details can represent rocks. Well-carved and inlaid figures' costumes can represent light silk and soft satin. The fish-scale patterns on the armor of military generals can also be represented by the natural colors of colored stones. Ge Kejian, He Mingsheng

    彩石雕嵌
    青田石作的彩石雕嵌还只有四五十年历史，同我国其他地区的镶嵌，有着不同的风格和独创之处。
    艺人们利用青田石的各种天然色彩，锯成薄片，拼凑起来，雕嵌成各种花鸟、人物、山水。色彩美丽，线条灵活，细可以表现柳丝，粗可以表现岩石。人物的服饰雕嵌得好的，能表现轻罗软缎。武将盔甲上的鱼鳞斑纹，也能以彩石的自然色彩表现。　葛克俭　贺鸣声
