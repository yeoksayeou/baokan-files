Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 24th: TASS reported that the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Malik, delivered Bulganin's reply to British Prime Minister Macmillan's letter of June 14th to Macmillan on July 22nd.

In his reply, Bulganin pointed out that neither from Macmillan's letter nor from the position taken by Britain in the Disarmament Subcommittee was there any sign of hope that the British government was willing to take jointly negotiated measures on the issue of disarmament, including the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon explosion tests.

Bulganin pointed out that it is now absolutely necessary to reach an agreement on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, separating this issue from other disarmament measures.

Bulganin pointed out that the British government proposes to decide whether to suspend nuclear tests based on whether agreement can be reached on other disarmament measures. Bulganin wrote that posing the question in this way means that negotiations to stop nuclear weapons testing are doomed to fail in advance. This position is a completely contradictory one.

Bulganin continued, writing that the British government is single-mindedly trying to entangle the entire disarmament issue with other unresolved political issues, including complex issues such as the reunification of Germany. Even those who are completely ignorant of diplomacy cannot help but suspect whether the British government and its NATO allies truly want to achieve the goals set by the United Nations for the Disarmament Subcommittee.

Next, Bulganin addressed the issue of European security in his reply. He wrote that Britain is actually evading a serious discussion of concrete proposals on this issue. Bulganin suggested that European countries and the United States jointly guarantee not to provide military or economic assistance to any country that disrupts peace in Europe, regardless of whether they have any alliance with the aggressor.

Bulganin continued, writing that the practice of stockpiling atomic weapons in Europe and launching an atomic arms race among European countries is threateningly deepening the danger of an atomic war breaking out in Europe. Bulganin therefore urged Macmillan to pay attention to a Soviet proposal that the three nuclear-weapon states – the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States – agree not to store such weapons on German territory.

Bulganin also said that he regretted that Macmillan's reply avoided mentioning the Soviet government's proposal to Western governments to condemn the use of force as a means of resolving outstanding issues in the Middle East. He wrote that the Soviet government still believes that the great powers undertaking this obligation would promote the stability and normalization of the overall situation in the Middle East.

Bulganin emphasized that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Middle East issue has always followed the following guidelines: to strive to ensure lasting peace in the Middle East, while taking into account the interests of all parties, but with respect for the sovereignty and independence of Middle Eastern countries.

When addressing the German issue in his reply, Bulganin said that the reunification of Germany is a matter for the existing two German states – the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Bulganin pointed out that they should negotiate this issue.

Bulganin wrote that the British government, like the United States and the French government, has violated the four-power agreement on the post-war development of Germany for many years. Bulganin asked: Are not the actions now taken by Western countries to revive militarism and form a military alliance with West German revanchist forces like a new Munich policy?

In his reply, Bulganin wrote that the Soviet government believes that strengthening economic ties between the Soviet Union and Britain on the basis of equality and mutual benefit will help establish closer relations between the two countries.

When discussing the expansion of cultural ties, he pointed out that, regrettably, the British authorities have in recent months refused to implement many important measures in Soviet-British cultural exchanges that the two sides had previously agreed upon.

Bulganin proposed that negotiations be held in the near future between representatives of the State Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations under the Council of Ministers of the USSR, which was recently established, and representatives of the British Council, in order to jointly plan the implementation of plans for cultural and scientific-technical exchanges.

    布尔加宁复函麦克米伦
    斥责英国在裁军问题上立场矛盾
    建议共同保证不援助破坏和平的国家
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：苏联驻英国大使马立克7月22日把布尔加宁答复英国首相6月14日来信的回信交给麦克米伦。
    布尔加宁在回信中指出，无论从麦克米伦的信中，或是从英国在裁军小组委员会上采取的立场来看，都看不出有任何给人以希望的迹象，表明英国政府愿意就裁军问题，包括停止原子武器和氢武器的爆炸试验的问题，采取共同协商的措施。
    布尔加宁指出，现在已经十分有必要就停止试验原子弹和氢弹问题达成协议，把这个问题同裁军的其他措施分开来。
    布尔加宁指出，英国政府提出要看是否能在裁军的其他措施上达成协议来决定是否暂停核试验问题。布尔加宁写道，这样提问题，意味着事先注定停止核武器试验的谈判一定失败。这种立场是一种完全自相矛盾的立场。
    布尔加宁接着写道，英国政府一心要使整个裁军问题同其他一些悬而未决的政治问题，包括像统一德国这样复杂的问题纠缠起来。即使那些在外交上是一无所知的人看到这一切也不禁要怀疑：英国政府和它的北大西洋公约组织盟国是否真正想达到联合国向裁军小组委员会提出的宗旨。
    接着，布尔加宁在复信中谈到了关于欧洲安全的问题。他写道，实际上英国是回避对这个问题的具体建议进行认真的讨论。布尔加宁建议，欧洲国家和美国共同保证不给任何一个破坏欧洲和平的国家以军事或者经济援助，不管它们同侵略国有没有什么同盟关系。
    布尔加宁接着写道，在欧洲囤积原子武器和欧洲国家掀起原子军备竞赛的做法，都是威胁性地加深了在欧洲爆发原子战争的危险。布尔加宁为此促请麦克米伦注意苏联的一项建议，即苏联、英国和美国这三个拥有核武器的国家约定不在德国境内存放这种武器。
    布尔加宁又说，他表示遗憾的是，在麦克米伦的回信中对苏联政府向西方国家政府提出的、谴责把武力作为解决中近东悬而未决问题的手段的建议避而不谈。他写道，苏联政府仍然认为，大国承担这一义务会促使中近东整个局势的稳定和正常。
    布尔加宁强调指出，苏联对中近东问题的态度一直遵循下列方针：致力于确保中近东的持久和平，同时考虑到各方的利益，但必须尊重中近东国家的主权和独立。
    布尔加宁在回信中谈到德国问题时说，德国的统一是现有的两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的事情。布尔加宁指出，应该由它们就这一问题进行谈判。
    布尔加宁写道，英国政府同美国和法国政府一样，违背关于战后发展德国的四国协定已经很多年了。布尔加宁问道：西方国家现在所采取的复活军国主义和同西德复仇主义势力结成军事联盟的行动难道不是像新的慕尼黑政策吗？
    布尔加宁在回信中写道，苏联政府认为，加强苏联和英国之间的以平等互利为基础的经济联系将有助于建立两国间更加密切的关系。
    在谈到扩大文化联系的时候，他指出，遗憾的是，英国当局在最近几个月以来拒绝实行许多从前双方已经取得协议的，苏英文化交流方面的重要措施。
    布尔加宁提议在最近由不久以前建立的苏联部长会议所属的国家对外文化委员会的代表和英国文化委员会的代表举行谈判，以便共同筹划文化和科学技术交流方面的实行计划。
