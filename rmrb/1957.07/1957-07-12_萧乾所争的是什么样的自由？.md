What Kind of Freedom is Xiao Qian Arguing For?
He Gurun

On June 1st, Xiao Qian published an article in the "People's Daily" entitled "Reassurance, Tolerance, and Personnel Work." The article mentions that it is now "early summer weather." From "early spring weather" to "early summer weather," it seems like a welcome progress, but upon closer analysis, it is not entirely so. We are open to any good criticism and suggestions; however, it is also appropriate for people to raise questions about some of the fundamental arguments in this article, especially regarding the issue of freedom. The article states:

	"Unfortunately, we cannot yet say that every Chinese person has the freedom of speech and writing."

When it comes to freedom, this is a matter of principle, and people can use it to measure the rationality of our socialist system. Freedom, in the development of human history, is a beautiful goal that millions have pursued and fought for. However, anyone with a little common sense understands that from different class positions and viewpoints, the noble word "freedom" has long been understood differently by different people. What exactly is the freedom that this article believes Chinese people do not yet have? I think it would be clearer to use the author's own words. He says: "We should tolerate people you don't like, tolerate words you don't like." He believes that in exercising "democracy" and "dictatorship," we should not easily treat "reckless speech" as "reckless action." If the freedom the author is arguing for is this kind of freedom, then it is worth considering: It is true that people engaged in various tasks should always humbly listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses to overcome shortcomings and correct mistakes in their work, which is absolutely necessary in our socialist democratic life; but we cannot help but ask: Should we also use the "generosity" demanded by this author to tolerate the anti-Party and anti-socialist "reckless speech" of people like Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Luo Longji, Chu Anping, and Ge Peiqi, and silence the people?

If our freedom is to defend "reckless speech," I ask, does this reflect the socialist freedom and democracy that reflects the interests of the people? Whose class's freedom is this "freedom," and for whose benefit?

From "Reassurance, Tolerance, and Personnel Work," what is hindering the author's pursuit of the freedom of "reckless speech"? It is said that dogmatists "in leadership positions" are responsible. Of course, we must resolutely oppose "leftist" dogmatism. However, is the tragic picture in the article, which depicts our real life as "killing a chicken to scare the monkeys," "the rabbit dies, the fox grieves," "a mantis trying to stop a chariot," and "it is not just one person who is beaten to death with one stick, but many people," true? I ask: If it is so terrifying and miserable, what is the joyful breathing of the new society in our lives? Moreover, these are all coming from leaders "in high positions." What excellence and beauty can such a society have? The author further finds another reason hindering so-called freedom: that is, there are personnel departments in institutions and organizations that are like "police stations," and the personnel departments are the right-hand men of the Party organization. It is very clear that what is being attacked here is of course the Party organization. If we look back at some of the recent speeches of right-wing elements, aren't they also slandering the personnel departments as plainclothes teams and attacking Party members as special agents? Think about it, isn't the saying about "police stations" too similar to these sayings? No matter how sharp the criticism is, we should absorb the correct parts from the criticism to correct our work, but people must also distinguish between right and wrong. We oppose "leftist" dogmatism, but we must also oppose rightist revisionism, which is even more dangerous. If the excuse of criticizing dogmatism is to strive for the freedom of anti-Party and anti-socialist "reckless speech" and promote bourgeois right-wing ideas, then this kind of criticism is worth considering carefully. We must consider what kind of road this kind of statement is paving the way for. Because regarding the anti-Party and anti-socialist "reckless speech" of right-wing elements, Premier Zhou Enlai said very well in the "Government Work Report": "The people will not agree to grant this kind of freedom."

    萧乾所争的是什么样的自由？
    何谷润
    6月1日，萧乾在“人民日报”发表了一篇题名“放心·容忍·人事工作”的文章。文中谈到现在是“初夏气候里”。从“早春天气”到“初夏气候”，看起来似乎是一个可喜的进展，但仔细分析一下，并不全然如此。我们对于任何好的批评和建议，都是虚心接受的；但是，对于像这篇文章中的若干根本论点，特别是关于自由这个问题，人们提出疑问来，也是应该的。文章中说：
      “可惜我们目前还不能进一步说：每个中国人都已经有了说话和写作的自由了。”
    谈到自由，这是个原则性问题，人们可以拿它来衡量我们社会主义制度的是不是合理。自由，在人类历史发展中，是一个千万人为之追求、奋斗的美好的目标，不过，稍有常识的人都懂得，从不同的阶级立场、观点出发，自由，这个崇高的字眼，也早已被不同的人，作着不同的理解了。这篇文章认为中国人所还没有的自由，到底是什么呢？我想还是拿作者自己的话说，可以更明白些。他说：“应容忍你不喜欢的人，容忍你不喜欢的话。”他认为掌握“民主”与“专政”，不应轻易把“乱说”当作“乱动”来办。如果说作者所争的自由是这样的自由，那就值得推敲推敲：不错，从事各项工作的人，应当随时虚心听取群众的意见和批评，来克服工作中的缺点，纠正错误，这是我们社会主义民主生活中绝对必要的；但我们也不能不问：对于像章伯钧、章乃器、罗隆基、储安平、葛佩琦之流的反党、反社会主义的“乱说”，也应该以这位作者所要求的那样的“雅量”，加以容忍，而使人民默不作声吗？
    如果我们的自由，是为“乱说”辩护，试问，这是反映了人民利益的社会主义自由和民主吗？这种“自由”究竟是哪一阶级的自由，对谁有利的自由呢？
    从“放心·容忍·人事工作”里看，究竟是什么妨碍了作者所争取的“乱说”的自由呢？据说“居于领导地位”的教条主义者要负责。当然，“左”的教条主义，我们一定要坚决反对。不过，文章中把我们现实生活描画成为“杀鸡吓猴”、“兔死狐悲”、螳臂不可抗拒车轮、“一棍子打死的绝不是一个人，而是许多人”的一幅悲惨图画是否真实呢？试问：如果这样恐怖、凄惨，在我们生活中，还有什么新社会的畅快的呼吸呢？更何况这些又都是来自“居于高位”的领导，这样的社会还有什么优越和美好可说？作者还进一步找到另一妨碍所谓自由的原因：那就是机关、团体里有着“派出所”一样的人事部门，而人事部门又是党组织的左右手。很明白，这里所攻击的当然是党的组织了。如果我们把最近的一些右派分子言论翻翻看，不是他们也在诬蔑人事部门是便衣队，攻击党员是特务吗？想想看，所谓派出所的说法，不是跟这些说法太相似了吗？批评无论多么尖锐，我们都应从批评中吸取正确的部分来改正工作，但是人们也必须分清是非。我们反对“左”的教条主义，却也要反对具有更大危险性的右的修正主义，如果借口批判教条主义，而其目的是为了争取反党、反社会主义的“乱说”的自由，推销资产阶级右派思想，那么这种批判就值得好好考虑了，我们必须考虑这种说法到底是为什么开辟道路。因为对于右派分子反党、反社会主义的“乱说”，周恩来总理在“政府工作报告”中说得非常好：“人民是不会同意给予这种自由的。”
