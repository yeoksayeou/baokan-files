    A Conspiracy to Invade Syria is Underway
    Israeli troops have recently been constantly provoking incidents and creating tension on the Israeli-Syrian border. This situation shows that an imperialist conspiracy to invade Syria is underway. This deserves the close attention of all those who care about peace in the Middle East and the world.
    Syria, because it adheres to a policy of peace, neutrality, and opposition to colonialism together with Egypt, is regarded by the imperialists, especially the American imperialists who are actively expanding in the Middle East, as a thorn in their side. Since the failure of the British, French, and Israeli invasion of Egypt, the United States has been trying its best to isolate Egypt and Syria, exerting pressure on them in all aspects, attempting to remove the main obstacles on the road to implementing the Eisenhower Doctrine. And Syria, due to its geographical location and domestic political situation, has become the number one target for American aggression.
    The United States mainly adopts subversive activities in its aggression against Syria. On the one hand, the United States creates economic difficulties for Syria, hinders its exports of cotton, wheat, and barley, and incites discontent within Syria; on the other hand, it actively supports pro-imperialist right-wing forces, encouraging them to launch coups. Especially after the Jordan incident, the United States, using the Baghdad Pact countries and Jordan, formed a threatening encirclement against Syria. The pro-Western forces within Syria were encouraged and eager to try. They once attempted to expel Syria's patriotic young officers, even assassinate them, and seize control of the army in order to facilitate a coup. They also attempted to win the by-elections in the parliament to show their strength. However, the patriotic nationalist forces within Syria are quite strong, and these conspiracies of the United States have been foiled.
    Therefore, the United States is now adopting more blatant means to subvert Syria. Judging from the facts revealed by the Egyptian and Syrian press and the dynamics in various aspects, the American conspiracy is as follows: The United States smuggles weapons from Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan into Syria, attempting to organize armed rebellions among nomadic tribes and certain mountain residents. At the same time, the United States directs the Israeli armed forces to provoke incidents on the Israeli-Syrian border, making the Syrian army concentrate on the border, which facilitates the conspirators to seize important cities such as Damascus and Aleppo. If this plan fails, Israel will launch an offensive against Syria, and then pro-Western Arab countries such as Jordan and Lebanon, under the direction of the United States, will send troops into Syria under the pretext of dealing with Israeli aggression, nominally supporting Syria, but in fact supporting Syria's pro-Western forces to overthrow the current Syrian government and achieve a coup.
    This American conspiracy has the support and cooperation of France. Because France once implemented the so-called "mandate rule" over Syria before World War II, it is very familiar with the situation in Syria. It is not difficult for it to find some agents and internal collaborators in Syria. Therefore, after the Israeli army provoked incidents on the Israeli-Syrian border, Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir went to Paris to discuss with the French government. After she returned from France, Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion clamored to a Zionist group from the United States that it was impossible for Israel to coexist peacefully with Arab countries. He later said that the Israeli army had received instructions on how to deal with Syrian "provocations," which were actually instructions on how to provoke Syria. At the same time, Lebanon and Jordan also suddenly seemed to have changed their unfriendly attitude towards Syria some time ago. Lebanese Foreign Minister Malik, known for being pro-American, announced that Lebanon believes that an attack on one Arab country is an attack on Lebanese territory. And a spokesman for the Jordanian Ministry of Defense also said that the Jordanian army is ready at any time. Jordan believes that an invasion of Syria is an invasion of Jordan.
    It is obvious that the imperialist conspiracy to invade Syria is ready. This conspiracy is basically the same as the Anglo-French conspiracy to invade Egypt, using Israel as a tool of aggression. The difference is that the imperialists have learned a little lesson from the failure of the invasion of Egypt, and this time they will not directly come forward, but will pull the strings behind the scenes, causing Arab countries to fight among themselves and benefit from it. The recent US shipment of a large amount of military supplies worth $20.7 million to Lebanon and the provision of $10 million in military aid to Jordan are obviously not accidental coincidences, but planned arrangements.
    However, no matter how cleverly the imperialists disguise and conceal, their conspiracy of aggression cannot be hidden from anyone. If they have forgotten the lessons of the failure of the invasion of Egypt so quickly and dare to re-ignite a war of aggression in the Middle East, undermining peace in the Middle East and the world, they will inevitably suffer a greater defeat. The Syrian people, with a patriotic tradition, will resolutely strike back against the invaders. And their just struggle will surely receive the full support of peace-loving people all over the world. The victory of the Egyptian people's anti-aggression struggle shows that although the struggle of the Middle Eastern people to safeguard their independence is very arduous, with the resolute efforts of the Middle Eastern people and the support of peace-loving people of all countries, the final victory will surely belong to them.

### 侵略叙利亚的阴谋在进行中

    侵略叙利亚的阴谋在进行中
    以色列军队最近不断在以色列和叙利亚边境进行挑衅，制造紧张局势。这个情况说明：一个针对叙利亚的帝国主义侵略阴谋正在进行之中。这值得一切关心中东和世界和平的人们的密切注意。
    叙利亚因为同埃及一起，坚持实行和平中立和反对殖民主义的政策，因而被帝国主义者们、特别是正在中东积极扩张的美帝国主义看作是眼中钉。从英、法、以色列侵略埃及失败以后，美国就竭力孤立埃及和叙利亚，对它们施加各方面的压力，企图扫除在推行艾森豪威尔主义的道路上的主要障碍。而叙利亚由于地理位置和国内的政治情势，就成为美国进行侵略的第一号目标。
    美国对叙利亚的侵略主要采取颠覆活动的方式。美国一方面给叙利亚制造经济困难，阻挠它的棉花、小麦、大麦的出口，在叙利亚国内煽动不满情绪；另一方面积极支持亲帝国主义的右翼势力，鼓动它们起来实行政变。特别在约旦事件发生之后，美国利用巴格达集团国家和约旦等，对叙利亚形成了压境之势，叙利亚国内的亲西方势力受到了鼓励，跃跃欲试。他们曾经企图驱逐叙利亚的爱国的青年军官，甚至于暗杀他们，夺取对军队的控制，以便于实行政变。他们也曾经企图在议会补缺选举中取得胜利，以显示自己的力量。但是叙利亚国内爱国的民族主义的力量相当强大，美国的这些阴谋都遭到了失败。
    因此，美国现在采取了更加露骨的手段来颠覆叙利亚。从埃及和叙利亚报界所揭露的事实和各方面的动态看来，美国的阴谋是这样的：美国从土耳其、黎巴嫩和约旦把武器偷运进叙利亚国境，企图在游牧部落和某些山地居民中组织武装暴动。同时，美国指使以色列的武装部队在以、叙边境挑衅，使得叙利亚军队向边境集中，便于阴谋者夺取大马士革、阿勒颇等重要城市。万一此计不成，以色列就将对叙利亚发动进攻，然后约旦、黎巴嫩等亲西方的阿拉伯国家在美国指使下，将以对付以色列侵略为借口，把军队开进叙利亚，名为支持叙利亚，实则支持叙利亚的亲西方势力，推翻现在的叙利亚政府，实现政变。
    美国的这个阴谋，得到法国的支持和配合。因为法国在二次大战以前曾经对叙利亚实行所谓“委任统治”，它对叙利亚的情况是很熟悉的。它不难在叙利亚找到一些代理人和内应。所以，在以色列军队在以、叙边境进行挑衅以后，以色列外交部长梅厄夫人就到巴黎去同法国政府商量。在她从法国回去以后，以色列总理本—古里安就对从美国去的一个犹太复国主义者团体叫嚷说，以色列同阿拉伯国家之间不可能和平共处。他后来又说，以色列军队已经接到了如何对付叙利亚“挑衅”的指示，实际上就是如何向叙利亚实行挑衅的指示。同时，黎巴嫩和约旦也忽然似乎改变了它们前些时候对叙利亚的不友好的态度。以亲美著名的黎巴嫩外交部长马利克宣布，黎巴嫩认为对一个阿拉伯国家的进攻就是对黎巴嫩领土的进攻。而约旦的国防部发言人也说，约旦军队随时准备着。约旦认为对叙利亚的侵略就是对约旦的侵略。
    很明显，帝国主义侵略叙利亚的阴谋已经准备就绪了。这个阴谋同英法侵略埃及的阴谋基本上是一样的，都是用以色列作为侵略的工具。所不同的是帝国主义者们从侵略埃及失败中学了一点乖，这次将不直接出头露面，而是在幕后牵线，使阿拉伯国家同室操戈，自相残杀，然后从中取利。美国最近把价值二千零七十万美元的大批军事物资运到黎巴嫩，给予约旦一千万美元军事援助，显然决不是偶然的巧合，而是有计划的布置。
    然而，尽管帝国主义者们如何巧妙地伪装和掩饰，他们的侵略阴谋是瞒不住任何人的。如果他们竟然这样迅速地忘记了侵略埃及失败的教训，胆敢在中东重新挑起侵略战争，破坏中东和世界的和平，他们必然要遭到更大的失败。具有爱国主义传统的叙利亚人民将会坚决地给予侵略者以回击。而他们的正义斗争，也一定会得到全世界爱好和平的人民的全力支持。埃及人民反侵略斗争的胜利，说明中东人民维护他们独立的斗争尽管十分艰苦，但是在中东人民的坚决努力和各国爱好和平的人民的支持下，最后的胜利必将属于他们。
