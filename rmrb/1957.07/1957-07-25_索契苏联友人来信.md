    Letter from a Soviet Friend in Sochi
    In early July, the editorial department of our newspaper received a letter from Comrade Na Wumofu, a teacher at Sochi No. 11 Middle School, a famous resort in southern Soviet Union. This letter reported on the students of No. 11 Middle School diligently learning Chinese. The following is a brief summary of the letter:
    At the beginning of this year, the Young Pioneers of Class A, Grade 6 of Sochi No. 11 Middle School invited me to give a report on the great People's China. The children were very interested in everything about China. During the break in the report, the children surrounded me, asking all sorts of questions, and requested that I organize a Chinese group in this class. On March 3rd of this year, the Chinese group was officially established, and it was named after the Chinese heroine Liu Hulan. All forty students in Class A, Grade 6 of No. 11 Middle School wanted to join the Chinese group. Finally, after discussing with the homeroom teacher, only students with a score of five or four were allowed to join the group.
    I myself have been studying China since 1936. On October 18, 1936, I gave my first report on China in the city of Rostov-on-Don. Since then, I have been systematically engaged in research in this area. Of course, my knowledge of Chinese is still very limited. For example, I cannot recognize handwritten Chinese characters, and I still have to consult a dictionary when analyzing articles, but I can still teach the children. In addition, I teach the children according to Lenin's principle: "Better fewer, but better." (The upper right picture shows the author teaching the children Chinese.)
    The study period for the Liu Hulan Chinese Group is four years, with four lessons per month. In addition to language learning, I also talk about important events in the current life of People's China in each lesson. On May 14th, I read Li Yueran's article in the "Friendly Newspaper" to the students, which mentioned Chairman Voroshilov inviting Comrade Mao Zedong to recuperate in Sochi. When the children heard this, they cheered "Good! Very good!" in Chinese. They immediately asked to learn poems about Mao Zedong and words to say when welcoming him. The girls even thought about what clothes the whole group should wear to welcome the distinguished guests.
    Of course, we know very little. But as the old Chinese proverb says, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." Now, we have taken the first step.
    On July 1st this year, the 36th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the Liu Hulan Chinese Group held a grand celebration. That morning, the children all came to school wearing clean white shirts and red scarves, with badges bearing the Chinese characters "Friendship" hanging on the left side of their chests. In the classroom where the celebration was held, the children hung pictures of Lenin and Mao Zedong and the national emblems of China and the Soviet Union. Above the blackboard hung a portrait of the young Chinese hero Liu Hulan. Chinese students also attended our celebration and introduced the life of the Chinese people. I introduced the heroic history of the Communist Party of China to the children. Finally, the children sang the song "Moscow-Beijing" in Chinese.

### 索契苏联友人来信

    索契苏联友人来信
    7月初，我报编辑部曾收到苏联南部著名休养地索契第十一中学教员拿武莫夫同志的一封来信，这封信报道了十一中学的学生们在紧张学习中文的情形。下面就是这封信的简要内容：
    今年年初，索契第十一中学六年级甲班的少先队员邀我去作关于伟大的人民中国的报告。孩子们对于中国的一切非常感兴趣。在作报告休息的时候，孩子们把我紧紧地包围起来，问长问短，并且要求我在这个班组织一个中文小组。今年3月3日，中文小组正式成立了，这个小组是以中国的女英雄刘胡兰的名字来命名的。第十一中学六年级甲班所有的四十个学生都要加入中文小组，最后同班主任商量的结果，只允许学习成绩五分或四分的学生加入这个小组。
    我自己是从1936年就开始研究中国的。1936年10月18日我在顿河上的罗斯托夫城市第一次作了关于中国的报告。从此以后，我就在这方面系统地进行研究工作。当然，我的中文知道的还很少，例如，手写的中文字我就认不清，分析文章时还要查字典，但是我还能够教孩子们。此外，我教孩子们是遵照列宁的这个原则的：宁肯少些，但要好些。（右上图就是作者教孩子们学习中文时的情况）
    刘胡兰中文小组的学习期限是四年，每月上四次课。除了语言学习以外，我每次上课都要讲一讲目前人民中国生活中的重要事件。5月14日我给学生们读了“友好报”上李越然的文章，文章里谈到了伏罗希洛夫主席邀请毛泽东同志到索契休养的事。孩子们听到这里就用中文欢呼“好！很好！”他们马上要求学习关于毛泽东的诗歌，学习欢迎时说的话。女孩子们甚至想到全组的学生应该穿什么衣服去欢迎贵宾。
    当然，我们知道的还很少、很少。但是正像中国古老的谚语所说的，千里路程也要从第一步开始，现在，我们已经走了第一步。
    今年7月1日中国共产党诞生三十六周年的时候，刘胡兰中文小组举行了隆重的庆祝会。那一天清晨，孩子们都穿着洁白的衬衫带着红领巾来到学校，他们胸前的左方都挂着写着中文“友好”两个字的牌子。在举行庆祝会的教室里，孩子们挂着列宁和毛泽东的照片及中苏两国的国徽，在黑板上方还挂着中国人民少年英雄刘胡兰的肖像。中国留学生也出席了我们举行的庆祝会，并且介绍了中国人民的生活情况。我向孩子们介绍了中国共产党的英勇历史。最后孩子们用中文唱了“莫斯科—北京”的歌曲。（左图就是他们集会时的照片）
