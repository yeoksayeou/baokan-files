Today's Wuzhi Mountain

The Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture has been established for five years. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the 600,000 people of all ethnic groups in the Wuzhi Mountain area have made great achievements and undergone great changes in all aspects. The primitive farming methods of slash-and-burn cultivation and using cattle to tread fields have been replaced by cooperatives in which more than 90% of farmers participate and the gradual adoption of advanced farming techniques. At present, the prefecture is self-sufficient in grain, with an average of 600 catties of rations per person per year.

In terms of cultural construction, the era of the Li people having no written language has also come to an end due to the recent formulation of the Li language script.

Now, people of all ethnic groups are continuing to work hard to build a beautiful socialist Wuzhi Mountain area and strive to realize the eleven-year construction plan of the autonomous prefecture adopted by the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

    今日的五指山
    海南岛黎族苗族自治州建立已经五周年了。五年来，五指山区六十多万各族人民在中国共产党的领导下，各方面取得了巨大成就，经历了伟大的变化。过去刀耕火种、用牛踩田的原始耕种方法，已由90％以上的农民参加的合作社和逐步采用的先进耕作技术所代替；目前全州粮食已能自给，平均每人一年有六百斤口粮。
    在文化建设方面，由于最近制订了黎族文字方案，黎族没有文字的时代也宣告结束。
    现在，各族人民正为建设一个美丽的社会主义的五指山区而继续努力；为实现中国共产党海南黎族苗族自治州第一次代表大会所通过的自治州十一年建设规划而奋斗。　赵慕志摄（南方日报社稿）
