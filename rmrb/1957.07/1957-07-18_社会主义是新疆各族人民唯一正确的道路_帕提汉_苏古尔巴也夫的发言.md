I fully agree with Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1956 national financial statement and the 1957 national budget, Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the results of the 1956 national economic plan and the 1957 national economic plan, and the reports of other comrades.

In the short seven years since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our people have achieved a decisive victory in the three major socialist transformations on the basis of the five major movements, and have made brilliant achievements in industrial construction and agricultural production. This has brought about fundamental changes in our country's social and economic landscape. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our various ethnic groups are united and are confidently and steadily advancing towards building a prosperous and strong socialist society.

I would now like to express my views on the implementation of ethnic policies in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region:

    Fundamental Change in Old Ethnic Relations

After liberation, the Party's ethnic policies were correctly implemented in the Xinjiang region, fundamentally changing the old ethnic relations and realizing new ethnic relations of equality, unity, and fraternity. A series of ethnic policy education campaigns were carried out among the vast number of cadres and the people, thereby enhancing the political and ideological level of the people and cadres of all ethnic groups, and continuously strengthening the unity and fraternity among all ethnic groups. On the basis of ethnic unity and fraternity, a series of social reforms and socialist transformations were completed. From 1953 to 1955, ethnic regional autonomy was promoted from bottom to top, and five autonomous prefectures, six autonomous counties, and some autonomous townships were established successively. In October 1955, the establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was formally announced. Since then, the aspiration of the people of all ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs has been realized, and the enthusiasm of all ethnic groups for socialist construction has been further enhanced.

In recent years, according to the needs of democratic reform, socialist transformation, socialist construction, and the development of various undertakings, we have paid special attention to the training of ethnic minority cadres in the implementation of ethnic policies. For example, various cadre schools and training courses have been established, and ethnic minority cadres have been sent to the interior for study. In addition, a large number of ethnic minority cadres, especially a group of Party member cadres with communist awareness, have been trained and promoted through various mass movements. At present, there are 61,330 ethnic minority cadres in the entire autonomous region, accounting for about 54.75 percent of the total number of cadres in the autonomous region, an increase of 22 times compared with the early days of liberation. Not only has the number of ethnic minority cadres greatly increased, but their political and ideological level and professional ability have also been considerably improved. A large number of backbone cadres and leading cadres of various ethnic groups have been trained, and they are all serving as leaders in Party and government organs. For example, ethnic minority cadres at the level of chairman of the autonomous region, commissioner, and county head account for about 68.59 percent. Ethnic minority cadres account for 57.29 percent of the section-level cadres in county people's committees. A considerable number of ethnic minority cadres also hold responsible positions in Party committees at all levels. The languages, scripts, customs, and habits of ethnic minorities are respected. In ethnic regional autonomous organs at all levels, the languages and scripts of the local ethnic groups are mostly used, which facilitates ethnic minority cadres in exercising their powers and improving work efficiency, and also further strengthens the connection between the Party and the people's government and the people of all ethnic groups.

Since liberation, in light of the specific conditions in Xinjiang and the needs of the people of all ethnic groups, industrial construction has been vigorously developed. As of 1956, there were a total of 17 industrial and mining enterprises above the quota and 658 industrial and mining enterprises below the quota in the region. Among the industrial and mining enterprises below the quota, 311 factories and mines were established after liberation. The total industrial output value increased by 49.1 times compared with 1949. With the development of industry, the number of ethnic minority workers in industrial and mining enterprises has increased to 19,546, accounting for 33.52 percent of the total number of employees in industrial and mining enterprises in the region, and most of these employees have mastered new technologies. This means that a contingent of ethnic minority workers has been trained in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The cultivated land area of the entire autonomous region has increased by 47.26 percent compared with 1949, the total grain output has increased by 1.06 times compared with 1949, and the cotton output has increased by 10 times. Due to the development and improvement of industrial and agricultural production, the cultural education and health undertakings of the people in the autonomous region have also been greatly developed. In 1949, there was only one university in the autonomous region, which increased to five in 1956. There are now 124 secondary schools, an increase of three times compared with 1949. The number of students in universities and secondary schools has increased by six times, and the number of primary school students has increased by more than 50 percent. The number of hospitals in the region has increased by 61.2 percent compared with 1949, and the number of beds has increased by four and a half times.

In recent years, great achievements have also been made in the united front work. Religious figures, representative figures of various ethnic groups, and all patriotic democratic figures have been united, and they have been helped to carry out ideological transformation. Therefore, they have played a significant role in socialist transformation, socialist construction, and the unity of the people of all ethnic groups. At present, the socialist transformation in the autonomous region has been basically completed and has achieved remarkable results. Comrade Saifudin has already given a detailed explanation on this point, and I don't need to talk more about it.

In general, the achievements we have made since liberation are enormous. These achievements fully prove the correctness of the Party's leadership and the Party's ethnic policies, and prove that the socialist road is the only correct road for all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The people of the entire autonomous region have a profound understanding of this based on their own life practice. The rightists attempt to reject the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose the socialist system. The people of all ethnic groups in our autonomous region are extremely indignant at these illusions of the rightists and are resolutely opposed to them.

    Overcome Shortcomings and Continue to Move Forward

Of course, there are also shortcomings in our region in the implementation of ethnic policies. For example, some autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties have not yet formulated autonomous regulations, and have not formulated the necessary specific regulations based on the characteristics of each autonomous region on the basis of the unified national legal system. Higher-level leading organs do not respect the powers of subordinate autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties enough, and do not pay enough attention to the development of various aspects of the more backward autonomous regions. In ethnic groups that have implemented regional autonomy, there is a lack of due attention to some issues of other ethnic groups in their autonomous regions. In some autonomous regions, there is no proper consideration for members of autonomous ethnic groups in the people's police, and there are still few ethnic minority cadres in some autonomous region organs, especially in the commercial and trade departments. Therefore, in commercial and trade work, many problems that could have been avoided have been caused due to insufficient understanding of ethnic characteristics and needs, as well as language barriers.

The financial powers of the various autonomous regions have not yet been clearly defined, so that each autonomous region cannot work well according to the specific conditions of the local area and give greater play to its initiative. In some ethnic regional autonomous organs, the use of their own ethnic languages and scripts has not been given sufficient attention. There are also phenomena of insufficient respect for ethnic customs and habits. The spirit of mutual respect, mutual assistance, and mutual learning between individual Han cadres and ethnic minority cadres is not enough.

It should be stated that the above-mentioned shortcomings are produced under the circumstances of lack of work experience and low level of cadres, and are happening in the course of advancement. But it must be affirmed that our achievements are the main ones, and no rational person can obliterate these facts. We will never allow the rightists to find individual shortcomings in our great achievements and take advantage of them. We must resolutely repel the rampant attacks of the rightists. The rightists attempt to oppose the leadership of the Party, undermine ethnic unity, and hinder the smooth progress of our socialist construction. The people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region will clearly pay attention to their conspiracies and tricks. The people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region cherish the Party and the people's government as they cherish their own eyes. We, the people of all ethnic groups, live in the embrace of the great motherland, and we must further consolidate the unity and unification of the motherland, thoroughly complete the socialist transformation, and fight bravely for socialist construction! In the future, we will implement the Party's ethnic policies on the basis of our existing work, regularly check their implementation, strengthen the publicity and education of internationalism and patriotism, further strengthen the equal, united, friendly, and mutually helpful relations among all ethnic groups, and mutually respect customs and habits, and overcome and prevent the tendency of great Han chauvinism and local nationalism existing in a few cadres. We must attach importance to giving play to the autonomous rights of the various autonomous organs, and divide the financial powers of the autonomous organs at all levels, because the clear division of financial powers is conducive to the autonomous organs to better develop production and construction and cultural and educational undertakings according to the specific conditions of the local area, and to better give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people of all ethnic groups, so as to rapidly improve the people's livelihood.

In the training of ethnic minority cadres, quantity and quality should be given equal importance. Only by training a large number of ethnic minority cadres with a certain political and professional level can we fully exercise autonomous powers, smoothly develop various undertakings, and strengthen and consolidate the connection with the masses of the people. In addition, with the help of the Han people and Han cadres, our construction will develop more smoothly.

In order to train ethnic minority cadres, it is necessary to vigorously develop cultural and educational undertakings. For this reason, the relevant departments of the central government are required to pay special attention to the cultural and educational undertakings in ethnic minority areas and provide financial support. At the same time, in ethnic minority areas, we should also attach importance to the use of local ethnic languages and scripts and the training of translation cadres.

In the training of local ethnic minority workers, we have done a lot of work since liberation and have trained a certain number of ethnic minority workers. However, some places do not pay enough attention to it. For example, when the relevant departments of the central government allocate workers needed by state-owned factories and mines directly under the central government, most of them are dispatched from various provinces in the interior, which is correct in one aspect, but we should first absorb local ethnic minority workers. If the number of people is insufficient, we should then recruit from the interior in a planned way. This can not only solve the local labor employment problem, but more importantly, it can cultivate and strengthen the contingent of ethnic minority workers. This has great significance politically and economically.

The people of all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region sincerely love and support the savior of all ethnic groups—the Chinese Communist Party, and sincerely support the socialist system. They, together with all the fraternal ethnic groups in the country, rely on the help of the elder brother of all ethnic minorities—the Han people, to fight for the construction of a great socialist society. We firmly believe that we will surely achieve the final victory!

    社会主义是新疆各族人民唯一正确的道路
    帕提汉·苏古尔巴也夫的发言
    我完全同意周总理关于政府工作的报告，李先念副总理关于一九五六年国家决算和一九五七年国家预算的报告，薄一波副总理关于一九五六年国民经济计划执行结果和一九五七年国民经济计划的报告，及其他同志的报告。
    我国人民在解放后的短短七年间，由于中国共产党的正确领导，在五大运动基础上取得了三大社会主义改造的决定性胜利；在工业建设和农业生产方面取得了辉煌的成就。这就使我国社会和经济面貌起了根本的变化。我们各族人民在中国共产党领导下，团结一致，正在满怀信心地为建设富强的社会主义社会稳步地前进着。
    我现在仅就新疆维吾尔自治区贯彻执行民族政策情况方面，发表一点意见：
    旧的民族关系根本改变
    解放后，新疆地区正确执行了党的民族政策，根本改变了旧的民族关系，实现了民族平等、团结和友爱的新的民族关系，在广大干部和人民群众中进行了一系列的民族政策教育，从而提高了各民族人民和干部的政治思想水平，使各族人民的团结友爱不断的增强，在民族团结友爱的基础上，完成了一系列的社会改革和社会主义改造事业。在一九五三年至一九五五年，自下而上的推行了民族区域自治，先后成立了五个自治州、六个自治县和一些自治乡。一九五五年十月正式宣布了新疆维吾尔自治区的成立。从此实现了各民族人民当家作主的愿望，并更进一步地提高了各族人民社会主义建设的积极性。
    几年来，根据民主改革，社会主义改造，社会主义建设和各项事业发展的需要，在执行民族政策工作中，我们特别重视了民族干部的培养。例如：开办了各种干部学校和训练班，派送民族干部到内地学习等。此外，还通过各种群众运动培养和提拔了大批民族干部，特别是培养了一批具有共产主义觉悟的党员干部。现在全自治区有民族干部六万一千三百三十名，约占全自治区干部总数的百分之五十四点七五。较解放初期增加了二十二倍。民族干部不仅在数量上有了很大的增长，在政治思想水平和业务能力上也有相当的提高。培养了大批的各民族骨干干部和领导干部，他们都在党政机关中担任领导工作。例如政府的自治区主席、专员、县长级的民族干部约占百分之六十八点五九。县人民委员会科长级干部中民族干部占百分之五十七点二九。各级党委机关中也有相当数量的民族干部担任负责工作。少数民族的语言、文字、风俗习惯，是受到尊重的。各级民族区域自治机关中，大都使用着本地民族的语文，这就便利于民族干部行使职权提高工作效率，同时也进一步加强了党和人民政府同各族人民之间的联系。
    解放以来，根据新疆的具体情况和各族人民的需要，大力发展了工业建设，截至一九五六年，全区范围内共有限额以上的工矿企业十七个，限额以下的工矿企业六百五十八个，在限额以下的工矿企业中三百一十一个厂矿是在解放后建立起来的，工业总产值较一九四九年增长四十九点一倍。随着工业的发展，工矿企业中民族工人的数目已增加到一万九千五百四十六人，占全区工矿企业职工总数的百分之三十三点五二，其中大多数职工都掌握了新的技术。这就是说，在新疆维吾尔自治区已经培养了少数民族工人阶级的队伍。全自治区的耕地面积较一九四九年增加了百分之四十七点二六，粮食总产量较一九四九年增加了一点零六倍，棉花的产量增加了十倍。由于工农业生产的发展和提高，自治区人民的文化教育、卫生事业也得到了很大的发展。一九四九年自治区仅有一所大学，一九五六年增加到了五所，中等学校现有一百二十四所，较一九四九年增加了三倍，大中学校的学生数目共增加了六倍，小学学生数目增加了百分之五十以上。全区的医院较一九四九年增加了百分之六十一点二，病床增加了四倍半。
    这几年在统一战线工作方面，也获得了很大的成绩。团结了宗教人士、各民族的代表性人士和一切爱国民主人士，并帮助他们进行了思想改造，因此，他们在社会主义改造和社会主义建设以及各民族人民的团结中起了重大的作用。目前自治区的社会主义改造已经基本完成，并获得了显著的成绩。关于这一点赛福鼎同志已作了详细的说明，我不必要多谈了。
    总起来说，解放以来我们所取得的成就是巨大的。这些成就的取得充分地证明了党的领导和党的民族政策的正确，证明社会主义的道路是新疆各族人民唯一的正确道路。对此全自治区人民根据自己的生活实践体会是很深刻的。右派分子企图不要共产党领导，反对社会主义制度，我们自治区各族人民对右派分子这些幻想是十分愤慨的、是坚决反对的。
    克服缺点，继续前进
    当然我区在执行民族政策上也是有缺点的，如有的自治州、自治县至今还没有制定出自治条例，没有在国家的统一法制的基础上，根据各自治地方的特点，制定需要的单行法规。上级领导机关对于所属自治州、自治县的职权尊重不够，对于较落后的自治地方的各方面的发展重视不够。在实行了区域自治的民族中，对于其自治地方的其他民族的一些问题缺乏应有的重视。有些自治地方的人民警察中，没有适当照顾自治民族成员，有些自治地方的机关中，本民族干部还少。尤其商贸部门的民族干部则更少。因此在商业贸易工作方面，由于对民族特点和需要了解不够以及语言方面的隔阂而造成了许多本来可以避免发生的问题。
    各个自治地方的财政权限还未明确划分，因此使各该自治地方不能很好的根据当地具体情况进行工作和发挥更大的积极性。有些民族区域自治机关中，对于本民族文字的使用上，还未得到充分的重视。对于民族风俗习惯也还有不够尊重的现象。在个别汉族干部和民族干部之间互相尊重、互相帮助、互相学习的精神不够。
    应该说明：上述的缺点是在缺少工作经验和干部水平不高的情况下产生的，是前进中发生的，但必须肯定我们的成绩是主要的，任何有理智的人都不能抹煞这些事实。我们决不允许右派分子在我们的巨大成绩中找出个别缺点钻空子，我们一定要坚决打退右派分子的猖狂进攻。右派分子企图反对党的领导，破坏民族团结，以及阻碍我们的社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。自治区各族人民是会清楚的注意着他们的阴谋诡计。自治区各族人民像爱护自己的眼珠一样爱护着党和人民政府。我们各族人民生活在伟大祖国的怀抱里，要更加巩固祖国的团结和统一，彻底地完成社会主义改造，勇往直前的为进行社会主义建设而斗争！今后我们将在已有的工作基础上贯彻执行党的民族政策，定期地检查其执行情况，加强国际主义与爱国主义的宣传教育，更进一步地加强各民族之间的平等、团结、友爱、互助关系并互相尊重风俗习惯，克服与防止在少数干部中存在着的大民族主义与地方民族主义的倾向。要重视发挥各自治机关的自治权利，划分各级自治机关的财政权限，因为明确划分财政权限，有利于自治机关更好地根据地方的具体条件发展生产建设和文化教育事业，更好地发挥各族人民的积极性与创造性，以达到迅速改善人民生活的目的。
    在培养少数民族干部方面，应当是数量与质量并重。只有培养出大批具备一定政治业务水平的民族干部，才能充分发挥自治职权，顺利发展各项事业，并能加强与巩固同人民群众的联系。再加上汉族人民和汉族干部的帮助，就会使我们的建设更加顺利地向前发展。
    为了培养民族干部，必须大力发展文化教育事业，为此要求中央有关部门特别重视民族地区的文教事业，并在财政上予以照顾。同时在民族地区还应重视使用当地民族的语言文字和培养翻译干部的工作。
    在培养地方民族工人方面，解放后，我们做了不少的工作，培养了一定数量的民族工人。但有些地方还重视不够，例如中央有关部门调配直属中央的国营厂矿中需要的工人时，大部分是由内地各省调派的，这在一方面是对的，但应该首先吸收当地的民族工人，若人数不足时，再有计划地由内地招聘。这样既可以解决当地劳动就业问题，同时更重要的是可以培养壮大少数民族工人的队伍。这不论在政治上、经济上来说，都有着重大的意义。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的各族人民，衷心地爱戴和拥护各民族的救星——中国共产党，衷心地拥护社会主义制度。他们同全国的各个兄弟民族一起，依靠各少数民族的老大哥——汉族人民的帮助，为建设伟大的社会主义社会而奋斗，我们坚决相信一定能取得最后胜利！
