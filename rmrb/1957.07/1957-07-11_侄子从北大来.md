    My Nephew Comes from Peking University
    Yu Lin
    One Sunday last month, my nephew, who is studying at Peking University, came to see me in the city. He told me, with some anger and some anxiety, that rightists in the school were using the rectification campaign to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. His anger was easy to understand, and his anxiety was because there had been no counterattack against the rightists at that time, and he was worried that even bigger things would happen.
    His words made me angry too. My alma mater is Yenching University. After the merger of Yenching University and Peking University, I also regarded the current Peking University as my alma mater. When I think back to when I was studying there, when half of China was being trampled under the iron hooves of Japanese invaders, how much our generation of young people longed for the motherland to be liberated from the enemy's bloody claws, longed for the motherland to one day become a free and prosperous country. Many people were willing to sacrifice everything for this goal, including their own lives. But today, when the motherland has already experienced two revolutionary victories, some people are standing up to oppose socialism and oppose the new China. How can I not be angry!
    I really want to talk to those classmates who have been confused, captured, and used by them. I'm only a little over ten years older than you, but it's like we're separated by a long era. We lived under the enemy's bayonets at that time. Classmates and relatives would suddenly disappear. The piercing sound of police cars in the middle of the night would wake you up. You had to be searched at city gates and street corners before you could pass. To read a favorite book, you had to be sneaky. You had to look around at the people around you before saying anything. I remember walking on the streets of Beijing at that time, like a homeless wanderer, watching the yellow trucks of the Japanese invaders rushing around, and feeling that myself and this beloved land—the weeping willows on Qionghua Island and the green waves beside the Jade Belt Bridge—were suffering infinite humiliation.
    In such depressed days, young people used various methods to find a way to change the status quo. I once sought truth in the works of Lu Xun, Mao Dun, and Ba Jin, and I also sought a way out in Nietzsche's philosophy and in "Mutual Aid." Finally, I found Marxism-Leninism and joined the Party. Only then did I no longer feel lonely and no longer feel homeless. I clearly remember the tremendous emotion when we read "On New Democracy" and "On Protracted War," secretly transported from the liberated areas. It was as if a force suddenly filled your whole body, as if someone groping for a road in boundless darkness had suddenly found a guiding light.
    Under the leadership of the Party, we organized reading groups under various names, striving for and uniting many young people groping for a road in the dark. The spark left by the "December 9th" Movement was inherited by us. What I mean by "inherited" includes not only the spiritual aspect but also the material aspect. During the "December 9th" Movement, the Party and the "National Salvation Vanguard" organization of Yenching University had a box of progressive books, including some introductory books on Marxism-Leninism, which were left to us. This box of books was hidden in the home of a professor who was willing to protect us, and I was the one who contacted that professor. When we secretly organized the reading and discussion of these books, how excited and excited we were. We also saved money to support comrades in difficult circumstances, introduced people to the liberated areas, and rescued those who were arrested...
    I also remembered the excitement when I entered the anti-Japanese base area in the liberated area, and the sacrifice of Comrade Wang Ce, who went to the liberated area with us. She was a sophomore at Yenching University and went to the grassroots level to work soon after arriving in the liberated area, working in the Party's propaganda work in the district. She was quickly loved by the peasants. In the autumn of 1943, the enemy carried out a major "mopping-up operation." She had malaria and insisted on working around the enemy's strongholds and was unfortunately captured. The cunning enemy saw that she was a cadre and threatened her in every possible way. But she only answered all the enemy's questions with silence. The enemy inquired about her identity from the masses, but no one was willing to tell them. Finally, the enemy killed her with bayonets. Before she sacrificed, another classmate from Yenching University died in battle while breaking through in the Pingxi base area. I think of these things because they gave me encouragement and determination every time I encountered difficulties in work or thought. When enjoying the joy of victory, I would also think of them. When the whole country was liberated, I returned to Beijing and saw revolutionary troops walking where the enemy used to rush around, and saw us secretly chanting "Mao Zedong," "Communist Party" in places, openly cheering "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" I shed tears. We dedicated all our youthful strength for this day!
    When I heard my nephew talk about the anti-Party activities of the rightists at Peking University, I was angry at their reactionary words and deeds, and also angry that they had tarnished the deceased. I not only myself, but also in the name of the dead, wanted to file a complaint. We will never allow these anti-Party and anti-socialist scum to tarnish our alma mater, to tarnish the place where these martyrs once engaged in underground struggles. The glorious traditions of the "May Fourth" and "December 9th" Movements must not be trampled and distorted by these scum.
    I told my nephew not to worry, the people will not allow these few ambitious people to be rampant, and recent facts have already proved this.

    侄子从北大来
    俞林
    上个月的一个星期日，在北京大学学习的侄子进城来看我，他带着几分愤怒、几分忧虑地告诉我，学校里右派分子正利用整风从事反党、反社会主义的活动。他的愤怒是好理解的，他的忧虑是因为当时还没有向右派分子进行反击，担心会闹更大的事情。
    他的话使我也愤怒了。我的母校是燕京大学，燕大和北大合并后，我也就把现在的北大看做我的母校。想起我在那里读书的时候，半个中国正处在日寇铁蹄的践踏下，我们那一代青年是多么渴望着祖国从敌人的血爪下解放，渴望着祖国有一天能变成一个自由富强的国家。很多人愿意为着这个目的牺牲自己的一切，包括自己的生命。可是，在今天，在祖国已经经历了两个革命胜利的今天，竟有人站出来反对社会主义，反对新中国，我怎么能不愤怒呢！
    我很想跟那些被他们迷惑俘虏和利用过的同学们谈一谈。我比你们才只大十几岁，可是我们却像隔着一段很长的年代，我们那时候在敌人的刺刀下过日子，同学和亲友会突然失踪，夜半刺耳的警车会把你惊醒，在城门、街口要经过搜身才能通过。看一本喜欢的书，要偷偷摸摸的，说任何一句话要看看周围的人。我记得当时走到北京的街道上，就像是一个无家可归的流浪儿，看着日寇的黄卡车在横冲直闯，就觉得自己和这亲爱的土地——琼岛上的垂柳和玉蝀桥边的碧波都蒙受着无限的羞辱。
    在这样苦闷的日子里，青年们用着种种方法寻找改变现状的道路。我曾从鲁迅、茅盾、巴金的著作里寻找真理，也曾在尼采哲学那里，在“互助论”那里寻找出路。最后找到了马列主义，加入了党，这时候我才不再感到孤独，不再感到无家可归了。我清楚地记得我们阅读从解放区秘密运来的“新民主主义论”和“论持久战”时的那种巨大的感情，就好像有一股什么力量一下子塞满了你的周身，好像一个在无边的黑暗里摸索道路的人，突然找到了引路的明灯。
    在党的领导下，我们组织了各种名义的读书会，争取和团结了很多在黑暗中摸索道路的青年，“一二九”运动所留下的火种被我们继承了。我所说的“继承”，除了精神方面，还有物质的一面。“一二九”时燕大的党和“民先”组织有一箱进步书籍，包括一些马列主义的启蒙书，遗交给我们了，这箱书藏在一个肯掩护我们的教授家里，由我和那位教授联系。当我们秘密地组织阅读和讨论这些书的时候，我们是多么兴奋和激动呵。我们还积钱支援生活困难的同志，介绍人到解放区去，营救被捕的人……
    我又想起了进解放区抗日根据地时的那种激动的心情，想起了和我们一起到解放区的王册同志的牺牲，她是燕大二年级的学生，到解放区不久就到下层锻炼，在区里担任党的宣传工作，很快就受到农民的喜爱。1943年秋天敌人大“扫荡”，她发着疟疾，在敌人据点周围坚持工作，不幸被俘。狡猾的敌人看出她是个干部，百般威胁她。但是她只用沉默回答敌人的一切问话。敌人向群众打听她的身份，没一个人肯讲，最后敌人用刺刀杀害了她。在她牺牲之前，另一位燕大的同学在平西根据地突围时战死。我想到这些，是因为我每次遇到工作上或思想上的困难时，他们就给了我鼓励和决心。在享受胜利的欢乐的时候，我也会想到他们。当全国解放，我重回到北京，看到过去敌人横冲直闯的地方走着革命的队伍，看到我们秘密地念着“毛泽东”、“共产党”的地方，公开地欢呼着“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”我流泪了，我们就是为着这一天献出全部青春的力量呵！
    当我听到侄子讲北大右派分子反党活动的情形时，我为他们的反动言行而愤怒，也为了他们玷污了死者而愤怒，我不仅自己，而且还要以死者的名义提出控诉。决不容许这些反党反社会主义的败类玷污我们的母校，玷污这些烈士曾从事过地下斗争的地方。“五四”和“一二九”的光荣传统不容被这些败类践踏歪曲。
    我告诉侄子不必忧虑，人民不会允许这些少数野心分子猖狂，最近的事实已经证实了这一点。
