    Who is Huang Shaohong Protecting? What Cases is He Reversing?
    Our Staff Reporters' Collective Interview
    Huang Shaohong, in his capacity as a National People's Congress deputy, has been specifically collecting materials on counter-revolutionary cases during his inspection tours and from letters from the people. He cries injustice for counter-revolutionary elements and attacks our country's public security and judicial work and the anti-counter-revolutionary movement. In recent years, he has listed a number of cases in meetings such as the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, pointing out this as a miscarriage of justice and that as a disruption of the legal system; today he wants to appeal for this, tomorrow he wants to overturn that. Recently, we interviewed responsible comrades from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the public security and judicial departments regarding the cases raised by Huang Shaohong. The facts prove: First, the cases raised by Huang Shaohong are definitely not limited to the Xie Xin and Liu Maolin cases he admitted to at the National People's Congress meeting on the 15th of this month, but twelve cases. Second, among the twelve cases, one case was completely unfounded, two cases were criminal cases, and another case, the so-called Liu Maolin case, was completely contrary to Huang Shaohong's description and did not constitute a judicial case. Apart from this, the remaining eight cases are all counter-revolutionary cases. Third, even in these eight counter-revolutionary cases, there is not a single miscarriage of justice, and many criminals have been treated with leniency. Now, these eight cases are announced below. Readers will easily see who Huang Shaohong is ultimately protecting and what cases he is reversing.

    "Was the Anti-Counter-Revolutionary Campaign at Beijing Normal University Botched?"
    Huang Shaohong repeatedly stated: The anti-counter-revolutionary campaign at Beijing Normal University was botched. A certain young woman was struggled against and arrested during the anti-counter-revolutionary campaign because she returned from Hong Kong, and has not yet been properly arranged for. He also said that the prison transferred this young woman's cell because it was afraid of inspection by People's Representatives. He claimed that he would inspect the anti-counter-revolutionary work at Beijing Normal University in his capacity as a National People's Congress deputy to "seek justice" for her.

    The young woman Huang Shaohong was referring to is Xie Xin, the counter-revolutionary element exposed at the Beijing Normal University faculty and staff assembly on July 3rd.

    According to the information obtained by reporters from the public security department and the materials published in this newspaper on July 7, the situation of this case is as follows: Xie Xin, also known as Xie Ruizhen and Xie Zhen, is from Fuzhou, Fujian Province. As early as 1943 to 1945, Xie Xin cohabitated with Wang Tiaoxun, the director of the Fujian Investigation and Statistics Office of the Kuomintang Military Statistics Bureau, and had close contact with Kuomintang secret agents Yan Lingfeng, Zhang Yizhou, and others. She went to Hong Kong in 1947. According to Xie Xin, before she returned to the mainland, Lai Wenqing, the former director of the Fujian Provincial Investigation and Statistics Office of the Kuomintang Internal Investigation Bureau, had planned to introduce her to work in the Philippines, but it did not happen.

    In September 1949, Xie Xin came to Beijing and entered the Russian Department of Beijing Normal University through the All-China Students' Federation. After entering the university, she was consistently lax in her studies, frequently went out dancing, and did not return late at night. In 1950, she met Huang Shaohong at a dance hall in the Political Consultative Conference Cultural Club.

    Due to her poor academic performance, she had been held back several times. After studying for eight years, she is still a fourth-year student. She has not corrected her words and actions, but shamelessly slanders the school officials as "persecuting" her and sends letters of complaint everywhere.

    Before the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, Xie Xin wrote reactionary slogans three times, such as: "People's hearts are like jackals, killing without seeing blood. I want to fight against this group of jackals and dogs!" "What kind of world is this! So dark! There is no place to reason." "I want to kill people!" After the anti-counter-revolutionary movement began, Xie Xin's reactionary words and deeds were exposed by her classmates. Dissatisfied, she bought two kitchen knives, attempting to kill Yuan Xingju, the deputy leader of the study group. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested her according to law on July 31, 1955.

    After Xie Xin was arrested, she confessed to the above facts in her interrogation records and handwritten confessions, and expressed her willingness to repent. The Beijing People's Procuratorate, based on the lenient policy, exempted her from prosecution and released her back to the school on November 23, 1956.

    However, after returning to school, Xie Xin continued to make trouble unreasonably, went to the Municipal People's Procuratorate to overturn her original confession, and demanded to revise the original conclusion. At the same time, she wrote letters to Party and government leaders and school officials to file complaints and make many extremely unreasonable demands. For example, she demanded that she be paid a salary at the level of a government Grade One clerk from the date of her arrest, and later changed her request to be paid retroactively from 1955 at the salary of a lecturer, and requested an immediate advance of 500 yuan; she demanded to move off-campus for recuperation, with a monthly subsidy of 20 yuan for rent. Xie refused to accept the criticisms of these unreasonable demands from the leadership.

    After the rectification movement began, Xie Xin took this opportunity to launch a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, posted so-called "bloody tears accusations" as big-character posters, demanded that her reputation be restored, and reiterated her so-called "accusations" at the free forum assembly. After everyone refuted her words and actions with facts, she went to reporters from imperialist countries to appeal for her "persecution." She told people: I want to go to Hong Kong to engage in counter-revolution, I want to publicize to imperialism, and publicize everything about me to the United Nations.

    Huang Shaohong has known Xie Xin for a long time and cannot be completely unaware of her situation, but he insists on reversing black and white, and making the slander that she was "struggled against and arrested during the anti-counter-revolutionary campaign just because she returned from Hong Kong," and saying that "the anti-counter-revolutionary campaign at Normal University was botched." Why is Huang Shaohong so partial to Xie Xin? As for the prison transferring prisoners' cells, it is also an extremely common thing, but Huang Shaohong seizes on this matter to make a big fuss. What is his intention?

    The So-Called Case That Might Be "Buried at the Bottom of the Sea"
    Huang Shaohong once raised a so-called "wrongful case" that might be "buried at the bottom of the sea." This matter was revealed in the "Letters from Readers" column of this newspaper on July 5.

    The person arrested in this case is Han Guoping, a teacher at the cadre spare-time school in Longguan County, Hebei Province. In 1946, when Han Guoping was studying at Taiyuan Industrial School, he joined the Kuomintang, served as the secretary of the Kuomintang district branch and district party headquarters, and engaged in anti-communist propaganda on the streets and in cinemas in Taiyuan.

    In 1947, Han Guoping entered Fu Jen Catholic University in Beijing, and colluded with secret agent Xing Lianzhong to undermine the student movement, persecute progressive students, beat the class meeting chairman, and disrupt the class meeting organization. After Fan Guangdou, a progressive student at Fu Jen Catholic University, was arrested by the Kuomintang reactionary government, some progressive students attempted to rescue him. Han Guoping and Xing Lianzhong repeatedly tracked down the students who carried out the rescue, forcing these students to leave Beijing. Between the autumn and winter of 1948, the Kuomintang carried out large-scale sabotage of the underground organizations of the Communist Party and progressive groups in Beijing. After progressive students Yang Shaohan, Gao Qifei, and others, who lived in the same room as Han Guoping, were forced to leave Beijing, Han Guoping immediately searched their remaining luggage, intimidated the people who were keeping the luggage, and tracked down the whereabouts of Yang Shaohan and others. These counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of Han Guoping were reported by the victims and exposed by those who carried out reactionary activities with him.

    After liberation, Han Guoping's counter-revolutionary activities did not stop. In 1950, Han Guoping worked at the Liberal Arts Institute of Peking University and also served as a teacher at the street adult night school. During this period, he obstructed young Wang Shuxian from joining the military cadre school and obstructed teacher Chen Youhe from joining the League, and publicly spread various reactionary remarks. Therefore, he was dismissed by these two units in August and October 1951, respectively. In 1952, Han Guoping worked at the Chahar-Suiyuan Workers and Peasants Cadre Cultural Remedial School, and continued to spread reactionary remarks and molested women. All the teachers of the school jointly reported Han Guoping. In the autumn of 1952, Han Guoping was transferred to the Longguan County Cadre Spare-time School. Here, he openly incited students to strike and colluded with some teachers to squeeze out the school's director of teaching.

    During the anti-counter-revolutionary movement in 1955, the Longguan County People's Government arrested Han Guoping. During his detention, Han Guoping also incited sabotage among the prisoners. After a public trial by the Longguan County Court, Han Guoping was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprived of political rights for three years. Afterwards, the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court considered the Longguan County Court's sentence against Han Guoping to be slightly heavy, revoked the original sentence of the Longguan County People's Court, and released him.

    It is entirely appropriate to arrest and give certain punishment to Han Guoping, a reactionary element who has consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary activities in history, and continued to carry out sabotage after liberation and even during detention. As for the fact that the sentence was temporarily heavier, it cannot be called a "wrongful case." However, Huang Shaohong only listened to the "appeal" of Han Guoping's family and asserted that if the original sentence was not corrected in time, it might be "buried at the bottom of the sea." Who is Huang Shaohong ultimately crying injustice for?

    Is it "Fabricated" or Truly Counter-Revolutionary?
    Huang Shaohong requested an early trial of the counter-revolutionary element Su Qingyan case during his inspection in Guangxi. He also relayed Su Qingyan's words, saying that the government's handling of him was "fabricated."

    Su Qingyan was a technician at the Guangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture. Before liberation, he served as a Three People's Principles Youth League instructor in Shaoyang and a specialist at the Hunan Provincial Pseudo-News Office. He was responsible for reviewing news reports in Changsha newspapers. When he found progressive remarks, he would draw up a list and report it to the pseudo-provincial government for sealing. Under his persecution, the Changsha "Practice News" was sealed three times, and the "Wanwan News" was sealed once.

    After the liberation of Changsha, he still adhered to a reactionary stance. In his report to Huang Jie, the pseudo-governor of Hunan Province, he said: "When this government moved westward, I received a personal instruction from the former Secretary-General Yang Jixun to stay until the second batch of migration. Unexpectedly, the traitors Cheng (Qian) and Chen (Mingren) suddenly announced their rebellion on August 4. I have been deeply educated by the Party and the country and influenced by the President's personality. My conscience has not been extinguished, and I have suffered to submit to the rebellion. However, because the war between Changsha and Shaoyang was in a stalemate and traffic was cut off, coupled with the surveillance of the bandits, there was no chance to escape. Only now have I escaped from the tiger's mouth after many twists and turns."

    In 1949, Su Qingyan continued to write and publish reactionary articles and was arrested by the Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau. In September 1950, the judicial authorities released him based on the lenient policy, and then he applied for the Hunan Agricultural College. During his studies, he continued to spread rumors to confuse the public. During the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, he was arrested again with the approval of the Provincial Procuratorate.

    Another case Huang Shaohong requested an early trial for was the He Zhi case.

    He Zhi was a reactionary pseudo-military officer. Before liberation, he served as a platoon leader, company commander, adjutant with the rank of second lieutenant and first lieutenant, extra inspector and chief of the pseudo-police station, and deputy of the pseudo-police squad in Nanning. During his tenure as deputy of the pseudo-assault team, in October 1949, He Zhi personally led the assault team to surround the Nanning Normal School and arrested our underground party members and progressive students Wei Jiakui, Huang Bohong, Deng Rihong, Wei Mingxin, and others. After liberation, during his retention period, He Zhi privately sold a military telephone in 1950; and sold two revolvers for Tang Yinchang, the pseudo-police chief inspector, and Qiu Tiexiong, the pseudo-police, earning ten silver dollars.

    From 1952 to 1953, He Zhi was absorbed into the Nanning Engineering Team. During this period, he continued to spread ideas of changing the sky and spread rumors to undermine the system. On September 20, 1955, with the approval of the Nanning Municipal Procuratorate, he was arrested according to law and sentenced to six years of imprisonment by the Municipal Court.

    Readers can see that arresting the above two counter-revolutionary elements with notorious records is not a "fabricated" affair, is it? What is the motive for Huang Shaohong's hasty request for an "early trial" of these two cases?

    Calling "Injustice" Without Distinguishing Right from Wrong and With Ulterior Motives
    Huang Shaohong also stated that there was an 83-year-old Kuomintang member who was suspected by the government of having counter-revolutionary behavior and was detained for two years. This person's son worked in a customs office and was sentenced to three years in prison for allegedly harboring his counter-revolutionary father. Now, the father's problem has been clarified, and there is no problem, but the son is still serving his sentence. Therefore, he again demanded to "seek justice" for him.

    According to reporters' interviews with the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau: This 83-year-old Kuomintang member is named Dong Qunfu (original name Dong Fukai). After the Xinhai Revolution, he had been active in officialdom. After Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal in 1927, he served as the commissioner of the tenth administrative inspectorate district of Guizhou Province, member of the Purification Committee of Jiangxi Province, Major General Staff of the Security Command, and pseudo-county magistrate, and other reactionary positions. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as a judge in the headquarters of the Military Commission of the pseudo-National Government. From 1946 to April 1949, he served as the chairman of the pseudo-Nankang County Council. During this period, he occupied farmers' fish ponds and land, defrauded people of money, and beat workers on false pretenses. After the liberation of Jiangxi, he secretly ran to Guangzhou and never confessed his historical problems. The Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested him with the approval of the Municipal Procuratorate on August 12, 1955.

    During the preliminary hearing, Dong Qunfu admitted part of his crimes. At the same time, because he was over eighty years old and had lost the ability to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, it was decided not to pursue the matter, and he was released by the Guangzhou Municipal Court on October 15, 1956.

    One of Dong Qunfu's sons is named Dong Laiying, a Christian who originally worked at the Guangzhou Customs. Another son is named Dong Laidao, a reactionary military officer who was sentenced for counter-revolutionary crimes and is still in labor reform. During the anti-counter-revolutionary movement, Dong Laiying harbored his counter-revolutionary father and his younger brother, and used the opportunity of preaching to spread rumors and create trouble, spreading inflammatory remarks such as "Socialism opposes God and must strive to find a way out at all costs." The local public security authorities arrested him according to law on January 20, 1956, and sentenced him to three years in prison.

    Dong Qunfu has serious reactionary behavior in history and refused to confess after liberation. Is such a person really "no problem"? Dong Laiying harbored his counter-revolutionary father and his younger brother and spread reactionary remarks. Can this be tolerated? Of course, sentencing him to three years in prison based on this is relatively heavy and can be corrected. But Huang Shaohong called injustice for reactionary elements with ulterior motives and attacked the people's judicial organs for not having the legal system. What position is he speaking from?

    Shielding Counter-Revolutionary Elements Who Refuse to Confess
    Huang Shaohong also criticized the public security organs for handling cases carelessly and delaying them. He gave an example, saying that a female prisoner's mother told him that her daughter had been arrested for nine months and still did not know where she was being held.

    The female prisoner who was detained at that time was named Wu Renyi, a former student at the Shanghai First Medical College. In the autumn of 1949, Wu Renyi joined the "Legion of Mary" counter-revolutionary organization at Shanghai Aurora Girls' High School. In 1950, she became the vice president of the "Legion of Mary Immaculate Mother Branch." When Shanghai banned the "Legion of Mary" in 1951, she refused to register and burned evidence of the "Legion of Mary" reactionary organization, such as "military flags," "military volumes," and "Legion of Mary manuals," twice in 1951 and 1952. In 1953, during the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, she also beat and insulted patriotic Christians Feng Yuzhen and Wang Aihua. During the "anti-counter-revolutionary" movement in 1955, she "reported" to the counter-revolutionary element Zhu Hongsheng (Catholic priest, already arrested) about the situation of some Catholic believers with problems at the Shanghai First Medical College confessing to the organization, and prevented Yan Erliang (believer) from confessing his problems. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, based on these crimes, requested the Municipal Procuratorate for approval to arrest her on April 3, 1955.

    After Wu Renyi was arrested, she underwent eighteen preliminary hearings. In the fifteen preliminary hearings before February 1956, she consistently refused to confess her guilt. It was not until the sixteenth preliminary hearing at the end of August of that year that she gradually confessed her crimes and wrote five confession records and repentance letters. Because her crimes had been verified, the Public Security Bureau sent her to the Municipal Procuratorate for prosecution after the preliminary hearing ended on February 23, 1956. The Shanghai Second Intermediate People's Court, considering that she had shown signs of repentance, decided to exempt her from criminal punishment, educate and release her, and return her to her original school to continue her studies on September 22 of that year.

    Huang Shaohong actually shielded this person who did not confess in fifteen preliminary hearings. But he criticized the public security organs for their patient work as delay. Why is this?

    While in custody, Wu Renyi had asked her family for things five times. The second and third times, the Shanghai Municipal Prison wrote to notify her family, and her mother delivered the items herself. The time was December 1955. This means that her family had already known her whereabouts after Wu Renyi was arrested. Huang Shaohong's statement is also completely inconsistent with the facts.

    Defending the Counter-Revolutionary Element Ling Xianyang in Many Ways
    Another case that Huang Shaohong used to attack the people's public security and judicial organs was the Ling Xianyang counter-revolutionary case.

    Ling Xianyang was a Kuomintang member and one of Kong Xiangxi's confidants. He served as a business specialist for the Kuomintang China National Aviation Corporation, secretary of the Central Bank, manager of the Shanghai Qiujiang Wharf, manager of the Central Trust Bureau Printing Factory, president of the Business School of the University of Shanghai, general manager of the Central Printing Factory, Kuomintang receiving commissioner, president of the University of Shanghai, and other positions.

    In January 1936, Ling Xianyang, under Kong Xiangxi's secret order, participated in the "Kuomintang Military Commission Delegation to Germany" and signed the "Sino-German Trade Secret Agreement" with the Hitler government. After the War of Resistance Against Japan began, fascist Germany helped Japanese militarists invade China in many ways, and the people of the whole country were extremely angry. However, Ling Xianyang continued to be responsible for purchasing minerals and agricultural products in Hong Kong and transporting them to Germany until 1940.

    In the spring of 1946, during Ling Xianyang's tenure as general manager of the pseudo-Central Printing Factory, the workers of the factories under the factory in Shanghai went on strike to demand higher wages. Ling sent people to notify the pseudo-police bureau to suppress the strike, beat the workers, and arrested twenty workers on the spot. Afterwards, with Ling's approval, 125 workers who led and actively participated in the strike were dismissed. At the end of 1948, the pseudo-Ministry of Finance planned to dismantle all the machines of the Central Printing Factory and transport them to Taiwan. Ling Xianyang colluded with Wu Kaixian, the director of the pseudo-Shanghai Social Bureau, to suppress the workers who protested against the dismantling and transportation of the machines, and finally transported one-third of the factory's machines to Taiwan.

    During Ling Xianyang's tenure as president of the University of Shanghai, he actively undermined the school's student movement. In November 1947, patriotic students at the University of Shanghai prepared to strike and hold a memorial service to protest against the Kuomintang secret agents' unwarranted killing of Yu Zisan, a student at Zhejiang University. Ling convened an emergency school administrative meeting and decided to notify all teachers to attend classes on time and to tear down any slogans or wall posters that appeared. He also personally instructed Feng Jiasheng, the director of general affairs of the school, to notify the pseudo-Jiangwan Police Branch to send plainclothes police to prepare for suppression. Afterwards, he presided over a school affairs meeting again and decided to give Wu Hengji and other patriotic students who led and actively participated in this student movement a warning. On January 29, 1948, patriotic students at the University of Shanghai sent representatives to support the "fight for democracy and oppose persecution" movement of students at Tongji University. He decided to give He Muzhai and other nine patriotic students who participated in this student movement "suspension" and Wang Zongji and other twelve students "probation." In June of the same year, the people of the whole country launched a patriotic movement against the United States' support for Japan, and students at the University of Shanghai also organized societies and published publications to carry out propaganda. Ling again used the excuse of violating the so-called "school regulations" to order the banning of progressive students' organizations, prohibit the publication of progressive publications, and expel Yu Suzhen and other fifteen patriotic students who actively participated in this movement.

    Based on the above-mentioned crimes, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Ling Xianyang on April 27, 1951. However, considering that his crimes occurred before liberation and that he was able to confess his guilt in the years after his arrest, the judicial authorities decided to give him lenient treatment, and the Shanghai Higher People's Court announced on February 13 of this year that he would not be held criminally responsible (Ling Xianyang had been released on bail on January 4 of this year).

    However, Huang Shaohong seized on some problems in the legal procedures to attack the people's public security and judicial organs. He said: First, after arresting Ling Xianyang in 1951, he was not tried or sentenced for a long time. He also said: "I went to Shanghai to review the case files, but the case files were not in the court or the procuratorate. They were finally retrieved from the public security organs." Second, he said: "During the interrogation, he (Ling Xianyang) was asked how many sects there were in the church, how German fascism was organized, and how many school affairs meetings were held. It is impossible to achieve a thorough confession in this way."

    According to reporters' interviews with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau: After Ling Xianyang was arrested, in order to clarify his criminal facts, the public security organs alone conducted dozens of interrogations, including six times in 1951, and ordered him to write five confessions; many interrogations were also conducted from 1951 to 1953, and there were 22 handwritten confessions by Ling; 43 interrogation records were made in 1954; and seven interrogations were conducted successively from November 1954 to September 1955. How can this be said to be a long time without trial or sentencing? As for the complete case files of Ling's case, they were already in the Shanghai Municipal People's Procuratorate when Huang Shaohong went to Shanghai for inspection and were not backlogged in the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

    In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau only questioned Ling Xianyang about the discussions at the school affairs meeting on suppressing the student movement and who participated in it during the preliminary hearing. At the same time, considering that Ling had gone to Germany in 1936 under orders to meet with Hitler and sign the "Sino-German Trade Secret Agreement," and had been in trade contact with the representatives of fascist Germany stationed in Chongqing during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was asked about his collusion with fascist Germany during the War of Resistance Against Japan, not about the organization of German fascism. This is also completely different from Huang Shaohong's statement.

    Attempting to Overturn Cases With Various Excuses
    Huang Shaohong also raised a case, saying: "Some defendants cannot understand the interrogator's questions and must be assisted by lawyers. For example, one defendant fully admitted in the indictment that he had served as a Japanese translator, swept the countryside, tortured peasants, and other crimes. But after the lawyer talked with the defendant, he found that he was only thirteen or fourteen years old when he was a translator. Because he cooked for the Japanese army, he learned Japanese and was asked to translate when the Japanese tortured the peasants. After the lawyer analyzed and defended the defendant's favorable materials, the case was re-investigated and handled."

    According to the results of the investigation by the Shanghai judicial organs, the case that Huang Shaohong referred to was the Li Qingyu case in Shanghai. It has been verified that Li Qingyu's time as a Japanese translator was from 1941 to 1945. At that time, his age was fourteen to eighteen years old, not "only thirteen or fourteen years old."

    During Li Qingyu's time as a Japanese translator, Li Qingyu was present every time when farmers Yao Fuxiu and others were killed by the Japanese. Another victimized farmer, Wang Shuying, was personally searched and arrested by Li Qingyu. Secondly, Li Qingyu also actively participated when the Japanese burned down civilian houses, and he extorted money from the masses by relying on the power of the Japanese. But after liberation, Li Qingyu did not confess these crimes.

    Li Qingyu is resented by the people in his hometown—Songjiang County, Jiangsu. The masses requested the People's Government to arrest him and return him to his place of origin for handling. In September 1955, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested him and Li Qingyu confessed to the above facts during the interrogation. Afterwards, after research by the Shanghai Municipal Procuratorate and the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, the crimes committed by the defendant were all before liberation, and he was relatively young at the time, belonging to historical crimes. After being arrested, he was able to confess his guilt. The First Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Procuratorate decided not to prosecute Li Qingyu's case. He was released in April 1956 and returned to his original unit to continue working.

    It is certainly not a bad thing for lawyers to help defendants. However, after readers verify the facts, it is not difficult to see that the issue of using lawyers raised by Huang Shaohong in this case is just an excuse, and the basic spirit is to completely overturn this case. Li Qingyu's crimes are supported by both material evidence and witnesses, and he himself confessed to them. Can this be overturned?

    From the above eight cases, readers can see that those whom Huang Shaohong wants to protect are almost entirely historical or current counter-revolutionary elements. What he extremely hates are the people's judicial and public security organs. Huang Shaohong's attacks on the judicial and public security organs are definitely not for the purpose of establishing a revolutionary legal system. On the contrary, they are deliberate slanders aimed at weakening and defeating the most important organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is also Huang Shaohong's attack on socialism and an important part of his anti-socialist conspiracy. We must be a hundred times more vigilant and defeat this attack by the right-wing elements!

专栏：

    黄绍竑保护的什么人？翻的什么案？
    本报记者集体采访
    黄绍竑以全国人民代表的身分，在去各地视察工作的时候，或从人民来信之中，专门收集反革命案件的材料，替反革命分子叫冤，攻击我国公安司法工作和肃反运动。近年来，他在全国人民代表大会、全国政协会议等会议上，先后列举了一些案件，指这个是冤狱、指那个是破坏法制；今天要为这个申冤，明天要为那个翻案。最近，我们就黄绍竑提出的那些案件，访问了人大常委会办公厅和公安、司法部门的负责同志。事实证明：一、黄绍竑所提出的案件，决不止于本月15日他在人大会议上承认的谢昕和刘茂林两案，而是十二案。二、十二案中，一案根本是查无其事，两案是刑事案例，另一案即所谓刘茂林案，事实同黄绍竑的说法完全相反，也未构成司法案件。除此而外，其余八案都是反革命案件。三、就在这八个反革命案件中，也没有一案冤狱，而且好些案犯都得到了宽大处理。现在将这八案公布于后，读者不难看出黄绍竑究竟保护的什么人？翻的什么案？
    “北京师范大学的肃反搞坏了”吗？
    黄绍竑反复地提出：北京师范大学的肃反搞坏了，某某女青年因为从香港回来，而在肃反中被斗被捕，现在还没有适当的安排。又说当时监狱调动这个女青年的狱室，是害怕人民代表去视察。他声称要以全国人民代表大会代表的身份，去北京师范大学检查肃反工作，为她“申冤”。
    黄绍竑所指的这个女青年，就是7月3日北京师范大学师生员工大会上揭露的反革命分子谢昕。
    根据记者向公安部门了解，和7月7日本报刊登的材料，这个案件的情况如下：谢昕又名谢瑞珍、谢珍，福建福州人。早在1943年至1945年期间，谢昕就同国民党军统局福建调统室主任王调勋姘居，并同军统特务严灵峰、张逸舟等来往密切。1947年去香港。据谢昕对人说，她回大陆以前，原国民党内调局福建省调统处处长赖文清，曾经打算介绍她去菲律宾工作，因故没有去成。
    1949年9月，谢昕来北京，经全国学联介绍入北京师范大学俄文系学习。入学后，她学习一贯松懈，经常外出跳舞，深夜不归，并在1950年在政协文化俱乐部跳舞场中结识了黄绍竑。
    由于她的学习成绩低劣，曾数次留级，读了八年大学，目前仍是四年级学生。她丝毫不改正自己的言行，却无耻地诬蔑学校有关人员对她“迫害”，并向各处发信控告。
    肃反运动前，谢昕有三次写反动标语，如：“人心似豺狼，杀人不见血，我要与这批豺狼狗彘作斗争”。“这是什么世界啊！这么黑暗啊！连讲道理的地方都没有了”。“我要杀人！”等等。肃反运动开始后，谢昕的反动言行，被她的同学揭发。她心怀不满，买了两把菜刀，企图杀害领导学习的党员副小组长袁行榘。因此，北京市公安局于1955年7月31日依法逮捕了她。
    谢昕被捕后，在预审口供和亲笔供词中，都承认了上述的事实，并表示愿意改悔。北京人民检察院根据宽大政策，免予起诉，于1956年11月23日将她释放回校。
    但是，谢昕回校后继续无理取闹，并到市人民检察院推翻原供词，要求修改原结论。同时先后给党政负责人和校内负责人写信提出控告和很多极不合理的要求。如要求自逮捕日起按政府一级科员待遇发薪金，后又改变要求自1955年起按讲师待遇补发薪金，并要求立即先支五百元；要求迁居校外养病，每月津贴二十元房钱。领导上对这些无理要求进行的批评，谢都拒绝接受。
    整风运动开始以后，谢昕又借这个机会向共产党猖狂进攻，贴出所谓“血泪控诉”的大字报，要求还她名誉，并在自由论坛大会上重述了她的所谓“控诉”。当大家以事实反驳了她的言行以后，她又去找帝国主义国家记者，申诉她被“迫害”的情况。并对人说：我要到香港去反革命，我要向帝国主义宣传，向联合国宣传有关我的一切。
    黄绍竑和谢昕相交很久，对她的情况，绝不会一无所知，可是，却硬要颠倒黑白，提出只是“因为从香港回来，而在肃反中被斗被捕”的诽谤，并说什么“师大的肃反搞坏了”。黄绍竑为什么这样偏袒谢昕呢？至于监狱调换犯人狱室，也是极平常的事，黄绍竑却抓住这件事情大做文章，这又是什么居心呢？
    所谓可能成为“冤沉海底”的案件
    黄绍竑曾经提出一件所谓可能“冤沉海底”的“冤案”。这事曾在7月5日本报读者来信栏中有所揭发。
    这件案子的被捕者是河北省龙关县干部业余学校教员韩国屏。韩国屏1946年在太原工业学校读书的时候就参加了国民党，担任过国民党区分部和区党部书记，在太原街头和电影院里进行过反共的宣传。
    1947年韩国屏进入北京辅仁大学，又同特务分子邢连仲勾结，破坏学生运动、迫害进步同学、殴打班会主席、破坏班会组织。辅仁大学的进步学生范光斗被国民党反动政府逮捕后，一些进步学生曾进行营救。韩国屏、邢连仲多次追查进行营救的同学，迫使这些学生离开了北京。1948年秋冬之间，国民党在北京大肆破坏共产党和进步团体的地下组织，和韩国屏同房居住的进步学生杨绍汉、高起飞等被迫离开北京后，韩国屏立即去搜查他们留下的行李，向保存行李的人进行恫吓，追查杨绍汉等的下落。韩国屏的这些反革命破坏活动有被害人的检举，也有同他一道进行反动活动的人的揭发。
    解放以后，韩国屏的反革命活动并没有停止。1950年，韩国屏在北京大学文科研究所工作，兼任街道成人夜校教员。这一期间他曾经阻挠青年王淑贤参加军干学校和阻挠教师陈幼和入团，并公开散布各种反动言论。因此，1951年8月和10月先后被这两个单位开除。1952年韩国屏在察南工农干部文化补习学校工作，仍不断散布反动言论，还曾调戏妇女。该校全体教师曾联名检举韩国屏。1952年秋，韩国屏被调到龙关县干部业余学校，在这里，他又公开煽动学生罢课，并拉拢部分教员排挤该校教导主任。
    1955年肃反运动中，龙关县人民政府逮捕了韩国屏。韩国屏在被捕关押期间还在犯人中进行煽动破坏。经过龙关县法院公审，判处韩国屏有期徒刑八年，剥夺政治权利三年。其后，河北省高级人民法院认为龙关县法院对韩国屏的判处稍重，撤销了龙关县人民法院的原判，将他释放。
    对韩国屏这个历史上一贯进行反革命活动、解放后以至关押期间继续进行破坏的反动分子，进行逮捕并给以一定的处分是完全应当的。至于一时判刑较重了，也不能说成是什么“冤案”。可是，黄绍竑只听信韩国屏的家属的“申诉”，就一口咬定如果不及时纠正原判，就可能“冤沉海底”，黄绍竑究竟是替谁在叫冤呢？
    是“莫须有”呢？还是真的反革命？
    黄绍竑在广西视察时曾经要求提前审理反革命分子粟青岩案。并且转述粟青岩的话，说政府对他的处理，是“莫须有”的事。
    粟青岩是广西省农业厅技术员。解放前充当了邵阳三青团指导员、湖南省伪新闻处专员等。他曾负责审查长沙市各报新闻报道，发现刊有进步言论的时候，便开具名单报伪省府查封。在他的迫害下，长沙市“实践报”被查封三次，“晚晚报”被查封一次。
    长沙解放后，他仍坚持反动立场。在他写给伪湖南省主席黄杰的报告中说：“本府西迁时，曾奉前秘书长杨绩荪面谕留到第二批迁移，不意程（潜）、陈（明仁）二逆忽于8月4日宣布叛变，职深受党国教育及总裁人格熏陶，良知未泯，且苦附逆，惟因长、邵间战事胶着，交通断绝，加之匪逆监视，无机逃脱，迄今始辗转逃出虎口”。
    1949年粟青岩继续写发反动文章，被长沙市公安局逮捕。1950年9月，司法机关本宽大政策将他释放，后即投考湖南农学院。在学习期间仍造谣惑众。在肃反运动中，经省检察院批准，再次将他逮捕。
    黄绍竑要求提前审理的另一案件是何治案。
    何治，是一个反动的伪军官，解放前曾任伪军排、连长，少、中尉副官，伪警局额外督察、所长，南宁市伪警局突击队副等职。在任伪突击队副期内，于1949年10月间，何治曾亲率突击队员包围南宁师范学校，并逮捕我地下党员和进步学生韦嘉魁、黄波洪、邓日红、韦明新等。解放后，留用期间，何治于1950年曾私卖军用电话机一架；并且替伪警局督察长唐荫昌、伪警丘铁雄销售左轮手枪两枝，分得银洋十元。
    1952年至1953年，何治被吸收到南宁市工程队工作，在此期间，还在散布变天思想，造谣破坏。1955年9月20日经南宁市检察院批准，依法逮捕，经市法院判处六年徒刑。
    读者可以看出，逮捕以上两个劣迹昭著的反革命分子，难道还是“莫须有”的吗？黄绍竑急急忙忙地要求“提前审理”这两件案子的动机是什么呢？
    不辨是非、别有企图地叫“屈”
    黄绍竑还曾提出：有一个八十三岁的国民党员，被政府怀疑有反革命行为，关押了二年。这个人的儿子在某海关工作，有关方面说他包庇反革命的父亲，也被判刑三年。现在，父亲的问题已查清，没有问题，但是儿子还在服刑中。因此他又要求为他“伸冤”了。
    据记者访问广州市公安机关后了解：这个八十三岁的国民党员叫董群辅（原名董福开）。辛亥革命后，他就曾在宦场活动。1927年蒋介石叛变后，当过贵州省第十区行政督察专员、江西省清党委员、保安司令部少将参谋和伪县长等反动职务。抗日战争期间，当过伪国民政府军委总司令行营法官。1946年至1949年4月，一直任伪南康县参议长。在这个期间，他曾经霸占过农民的渔塘、土地，骗取人民钱财，借故殴打工人。江西解放后，他偷跑到广州，一直没有交代他的历史问题。广州市公安局在1955年8月12日经市检察院批准逮捕了他。
    在预审中，董群辅承认了一部分罪行，同时因为他已年过八十，丧失了进行反革命活动的能力，决定不再追究，1956年10月15日由广州市法院释放。
    董群辅的一个儿子叫董来英，基督教徒，原在广州海关工作。另一个儿子叫董来焘，是反动军官，因反革命罪行被判刑后尚在劳改中。在肃反运动中，董来英包庇反革命父亲和他的弟弟，并且利用传道的机会，造谣生非，散布“社会主义反对神，要不惜代价争取出路”等煽动性的言论。当地公安机关于1956年1月20日依法逮捕了他，判了三年徒刑。
    董群辅在历史上有严重的反动行为，解放后又拒不交代，这样的人是真的“没有问题”吗？董来英包庇反革命的父亲和他的弟弟，散布反动的言论，难道也能容许吗？当然，据此而判处三年徒刑，是比较重了一些，是可以加以纠正的。可是黄绍竑却别有企图地为反动分子叫屈，攻击人民司法机关没有法制，究竟是站在什么立场说话呢？
    袒护拒不坦白的反革命分子
    黄绍竑还曾经指责公安机关办案粗糙拖延，并举例说，一个女犯的母亲告诉他，她的女儿被捕九个月了，还不知道被关押在什么地方。
    这个当时被扣捕的女犯叫吴礽艺，原是上海市第一医学院的学生。1949年秋天，吴礽艺在上海震旦女中参加了“圣母军”反革命组织。1950年，她作了“圣母军无玷之母支会”的副会长。1951年，上海取缔“圣母军”的时候，她拒不登记，并且在1951年和1952年，先后两次烧毁“圣母军”反动组织的“军旗”、“军卷”和“圣母军手册”等罪证。1953年，在反帝爱国运动中，她还殴打、辱骂过爱国教徒冯玉贞、王爱华等人。1955年“肃反”的时候，她曾经把上海第一医学院某些有问题的天主教徒向组织上作交代的情况，“汇报”给反革命分子朱洪声（天主教神甫、已逮捕），并且阻止严而良（教徒）坦白交代问题。上海市公安局根据她的这些罪行，于1955年4月3日报请市检察院批准，把她逮捕。
    吴礽艺被捕后，曾先后经过十八次预审。在1956年2月以前的十五次预审中，她始终拒不坦白认罪；一直到当年8月底进行第十六次预审的时候，她才陆续坦白了自己的罪行，并且写了五次认罪笔录和悔过书。因为她的罪行已经查证属实，公安局便在1956年2月23日预审终结后，送市检察院起诉。上海市第二中级人民法院考虑到她已有悔悟认罪表现，便在当年9月22日判决免予刑事处分，教育释放，回原校继续求学。
    对这个十五次预审都不坦白的分子，黄绍竑竟然加以袒护。而对公安机关的耐心的工作，却指责是拖延。这是为什么呢？
    吴礽艺在押期间，曾经向家里要过五次东西，其中第二、三两次，是上海市监狱写信通知她的家属，由她的母亲自己送去的。时间是1955年12月。这就是说吴礽艺被捕后，其家属早已知道了他的下落了，黄绍竑的说法也与事实完全不合。
    多方为反革命分子凌宪扬辩护
    黄绍竑用以攻击人民公安、司法机关的另一案件，是凌宪扬反革命案。
    凌宪扬是国民党员，孔祥熙的亲信之一。当过国民党中国航空公司业务专员、中央银行秘书、上海虬江码头经理、中央信托局印刷厂经理、沪江大学商学院院长、中央印刷厂总经理、国民党接收专员、沪江大学校长等。
    1936年1月，凌宪扬受了孔祥熙的密令，参加“国民党军事委员会赴德考察团”，与希特勒政府签订“中德贸易密约”。抗战开始后，法西斯德国从多方面帮助日本军国主义者侵略中国，全国人民愤激万分，而凌宪扬却仍继续在香港负责采购矿产和农产品运往德国，直到1940年止。
    1946年春，凌宪扬任伪中央印刷厂总经理期间，该厂所属上海各厂工人因要求提高工资而罢工，凌派人通知伪警察局进行镇压，殴打工人，并当场将二十名工人逮捕。事后，又经凌批准将领导和积极参加罢工的一百二十五名工人开除。1948年底，伪财政部拟将中央印刷厂的机器全部拆运台湾，凌宪扬又勾结伪上海社会局局长吴开先镇压抗议拆运机器的工人，终于将该厂三分之一的机器运往台湾。
    凌宪扬任沪江大学校长期间，曾积极破坏该校的学生运动。1947年11月，沪江大学爱国学生为抗议国民党特务无辜杀害浙江大学学生于子三，准备罢课并进行追悼。凌召开紧急校务行政会议，决定通知全校教员准时上课，倘有标语或墙报出现即行撕毁。他还亲自指使该校总务长冯家声通知伪江湾警察分局，派便衣警察准备镇压。事后，他再次主持校务会议，决定给予领导和积极参加此次学运的爱国学生吴恒基等人以警告处分。1948年1月29日，沪江大学爱国学生推派代表支援同济大学学生“争民主、反迫害”运动，他决定给予参加此次学运的爱国学生何穆斋等九人“停学”处分，王宗基等十二人“试读”处分。同年6月，全国人民掀起了反对美帝扶持日本的爱国运动，沪江大学学生也纷纷组织社团、出版刊物，进行宣传。凌又借口违反所谓“校规”，勒令取缔进步学生的社团组织，禁止出版进步刊物，并将积极参加这次运动的爱国学生余素贞等十五人开除。
    根据以上种种罪行，上海市公安局在1951年4月27日将凌宪扬逮捕。但又考虑到他犯罪在解放以前，被捕后的几年中，尚能坦白认罪，因此司法机关决定给予宽大处理，由上海市高级人民法院于今年2月13日宣布不追究刑事责任（凌宪扬已在今年1月4日先行保释在外）。
    可是，黄绍竑却抓住法律程序方面的一些问题来向人民公安、司法机关进攻。他说：第一，1951年逮捕凌宪扬以后，长期不审不判。又说：“我到上海要调阅案卷，可是案卷不在法院，也不在检察院，最后在公安机关调出来”。第二，他说：“审讯中问他（凌宪扬）教会有多少派，问他德国法西斯是怎样组织的，校务会议开了多少次等。这样要做到坦白彻底就不行了。”
    据记者向上海公安机关了解：凌宪扬被捕后，为了弄清他的犯罪事实，仅公安机关即进行了数十次审讯，计1951年六次，并令他写了五次自白书；1951年至1953年也进行了多次审讯，并有凌的亲笔供词二十二次；1954年作过四十三次审讯笔录；1954年11月至1955年9月，又先后提审七次。这怎么能说是长期不审不判呢？至于凌案的全部案卷，在黄绍竑去上海检查时，已经在上海市人民检察院，并未积压在市公安局。
    此外，上海市公安局在预审中，只追问过凌宪扬有关校务会议讨论镇压学运的情况以及有那些人参加等问题。同时又鉴于凌曾于1936年奉令去德国会见希特勒签订“中德贸易密约”，在抗日期间仍一直和法西斯德国派在重庆的代表进行贸易联系，所以曾经问过他在抗日期间和法西斯德国勾结的情况，并不是问他德国法西斯的组织。这也和黄绍竑的说法完全不一样。
    用各种借口企图翻案
    黄绍竑还曾经提出一案说：“有的被告对审判员的问话不能体会，必须律师帮助他们。例如有一个被告对起诉书说他曾任日本翻译，下乡扫荡，刑拷农民等罪行全部承认。但经律师与被告谈话后，发现他当翻译时，年仅十三、四岁，因代日军烧饭，学会日语，在日本人拷打农民时要他传话。律师从被告有利的材料分析辩护后，该案也重新侦查处理。”
    据上海司法机关调查的结果，黄绍竑所指的这个案件，是上海李庆余案。李庆余充当日寇翻译的时间，已经查明是在1941年至1945年，当时他的年龄是十四周岁到十八周岁，不是“年仅十三、四岁”。
    李庆余在充当日寇翻译期间，在农民姚福秀等五人被日寇杀害时，李庆余每次都在场当翻译。另一个被害农民王淑英，则是由李庆余亲自搜捕的。其次，在日寇烧毁民房时，李庆余也曾积极参加，他并依仗日寇势力，敲诈群众。但在解放后，李庆余没有交代这些罪行。
    李庆余在他的家乡——江苏松江县是有民愤的。群众曾要求人民政府将他捕回原籍处理。1955年9月上海市公安局曾将他逮捕，在审讯中李庆余供认了以上事实。其后，上海市检察院和上海市公安局经过研究，被告所犯罪恶均在解放前，且当时年岁较轻，属历史罪恶，被捕后还能坦白认罪，经上海市检察院第一分院决定对李庆余案不予起诉。于1956年4月释放，回原单位继续工作。
    请律师给被告以帮助，这当然不是坏事。但是读者在对证了事实以后，就不难看出黄绍竑在此案中所提出的请用律师问题，只是一种借口，而其基本精神，则是根本推翻此案。李庆余的罪行，人证物证俱在，他自己也供认不讳，难道这能够翻案的吗？
    从以上八案中，读者可以看出黄绍竑所要保护的，几乎完全是历史的或现行的反革命分子。他所极端仇视的，则是人民的司法和公安机关。黄绍竑对司法和公安机关的攻击，决不是为了要建立革命法制，相反地，却是蓄意诽谤，用以削弱和攻垮无产阶级专政的最重要的机构。这也就是黄绍竑向社会主义的进攻，是他的反社会主义的阴谋活动中的一个重要部分。我们必须百倍警惕，打退右派分子的这一场进攻！
