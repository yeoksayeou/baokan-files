　　Zhang Bojun cursed: "Mao Zedong is the biggest rogue in Chinese history." Why? Because the Communist Party defeated Chiang Kai-shek, the situation of confrontation between North and South was gone, Zhang Bojun's hope of dividing the world into three parts between the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and himself vanished, the day of becoming a ruler was nowhere in sight, so he couldn't restrain himself from hurling insults.

　　In the eyes of the people, the right-wing elements and the like of Chiang Kai-shek are heroes; while in the eyes of the people, the good leaders, in the eyes of Chiang Kai-shek and his ilk, are bandits, and in the eyes of the right-wing element Zhang Bojun, are big rogues. The boundary here is very clear, isn't it? People of different classes and different positions have different views of people and things!

　　But what kind of role is the one who curses others as big rogues playing? Let's look at the materials exposed by Mr. Yan Xinmin of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in the People's Daily on July 3rd. Here, I will only quote a small passage: "After liberation, when several friends talked to Zhang Bojun about the sacrifice of Zeng Wei and others for the revolution, he said that Zeng Wei deserved to die, who told him not to listen to me." The people express respect, grief, and remembrance for the martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution, whether they are Communist Party members or non-Communist Party members, but Zhang Bojun cursed them—cursed his own comrades in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party who sacrificed for the revolution as deserving to die. This is truly an insidious, cold-blooded, and ruthless political rogue face.

 　 流氓相
　　岳军
    章伯钧骂道：“毛泽东是中国历史上第一个大流氓”，为什么？因为共产党把蒋介石打垮了，南北对持的局面没有了，章伯钧想和国、共三分天下的希望幻灭了，称君之日遥遥无期了，于是乎情不可遏地辱骂了起来。
    人民眼里的右派分子，蒋介石之流看来是好汉；而人民眼里的好领袖，蒋介石之流看来是匪，右派分子章伯钧看来是大流氓。这里界线本来就很清楚，不同阶级不同立场的人看人看事本来就不同的?！
    但骂别人是大流氓者自己又是什么样的角色呢？且看7月3日人民日报农工民主党严信民先生揭发的材料，这儿只引一小段：“解放后几位朋友向章伯钧谈到曾伟等为革命牺牲的时候，他说曾伟死的活该，谁叫他不听我的话。”人民对为革命牺牲的先烈，不管是共产党员或非共产党员，都表示尊敬、哀痛和纪念，但章伯钧却骂他们——骂他自己农工民主党内为革命牺牲的同志活该。这是道道地地一副阴险、冷酷、翻脸无情的政治流氓相。
