    Poetry Handbill
    This is poetry, and also a handbill;
    It is a bugle call, and also a bullet.
    
    Nursery Rhyme
    Jin Jin
    Rightists, rightists,
    Like monsters,
    Saying nice things to your face,
    Sabotaging behind your back.
    Seeing the sun,
    They say it's dark,
    Happy life,
    They call it miserable.
    Socialism,
    They say it's unfavorable,
    Mention America,
    Their hearts are filled with joy.
    What is this?
    It's a bad thing,
    If it doesn't change,
    Then throw it in the trash!
    
    Shrapnel
    Liu Yunzhi
    To the Repenters
    The south wind and the north-bound rain,
    Which way are they blowing and scraping the rudder to turn?
    The words spoken and the water spilled,
    Trying to deny them will be difficult.
    
    To Those Who Argue for Conscience
    Don't be too obsessed with your compassionate "conscience,"
    The weight of truth outweighs it by more than a thousand pounds!
    Let me read you again that famous warning:
    "Pity for the enemy is cruelty to the people."
    
    To the Objectivists
    Don't pray to step on an auspicious cloud,
    And ascend into space to pick stars;
    If you really want to objectively explore problems,
    Don't you need a pair of class-based eyes?
    (Originally published in Peking University's poetry journal "Red Mansion")

    The Starving Wolf Comes Down the Mountain
    Chun Cao
    The starving wolf comes down the mountain,
    Qinghua produced a Master Qian.
    The toad climbed to the top of the tree,
    Master Qian一心想偷天 (wholeheartedly wants to steal the sky).
    Carrying a bamboo basket to fetch water,
    Master Qian's legs are worn out.
    A clap of thunder before and after the Awakening of Insects,
    Master Qian woke up in the middle of the night.
    Sweating cold sweat and wearing a mournful face,
    Master Qian is beaten with a stick but still shamelessly brazen.
    (Originally published in Tsinghua University's "Street Poetry")

    Waves Washing Sand
    (A Serious Warning to Qian Weichang)
    D郎耍无赖，众怒难排 (D Lang is playing rogue, public anger is hard to appease),
    Several self-criticisms, who are you deceiving?
    The magic tricks are exhausted, exposing your true colors.
    Turn back early, rein in at the edge of the cliff,
    The door of socialism is open.
    Cutting yourself off from the people is not the right path, you deserve to regret it.
          (Originally published on a Tsinghua University wall poster)

    Such Tricks
    What you exposed,
    He has already said;
    What you didn't expose,
    He has already forgotten;
    Important matters,
    He understates and glosses over,
    Unimportant matters,
    He chatters on and on.
     (Originally published on Peking University's "666" wall poster)

### 诗传单

专栏：诗传单

    诗传单
    这里是诗，也是传单；
    它是号角，也是子弹。
    儿歌
    金近
    右派右派，
    像个妖怪，
    当面说好，
    背后破坏。
    见到太阳，
    他说黑暗，
    幸福生活，
    他叫悲惨。
    社会主义，
    他说不利，
    提起美国，
    心里欢喜。
    这是什么？
    是坏东西，
    他要不改，
    那就扔进垃圾箱里！
    霰弹
    刘耘之
    给耍赖者
    南来的风啊北去的雨，
    吹刮着方向舵转向哪里？
    讲出来的话啊泼下地的水，
    想要赖掉可是难的。
    给良心论者
    不要过于执迷你慈悲的“良心”，
    真理的重量胜过它何止千斤？
    让我再给你读读那有名的警句：
    “对敌人的怜悯就是对人民的残忍。”
    给客观主义者
    不要祈求脚下踏一朵祥云，
    升到太空里去采摘星星；
    假使真想客观地探讨问题，
    难道不需要有一双阶级的眼睛？
    （原载北京大学诗刊“红楼”）
    饿瘦了的恶狼下山来
    春草
    饿瘦了的恶狼下山来，
    清华出了个钱二爷。
    蛤蟆爬上了树尖尖，
    钱二爷一心想偷天。
    提着竹篮去打水，
    忙坏了二爷两条腿。
    惊蛰前后一声雷，
    钱二爷梦醒后半夜。
    流着冷汗哭丧着脸，
    钱二爷挨棍还厚着脸。
    （原载清华大学“街头诗”）
    浪淘沙
    （正告钱伟长）
    大郎耍无赖，众怒难排，
    几番检讨骗谁来？
    戏法花招都用尽，毕露形骸。
    及早回头来，勒马悬崖，
    社会主义大门开。
    自绝人民非大道，后悔活该。
          （原载清华大学墙报）
    如此伎俩
    你揭开的，
    他都说了；
    你没揭的，
    他都忘了；
    事关紧要，
    他淡写轻描，
    无关紧要的，
    他唠唠叨叨。
     （原载北京大学“666”墙报）
