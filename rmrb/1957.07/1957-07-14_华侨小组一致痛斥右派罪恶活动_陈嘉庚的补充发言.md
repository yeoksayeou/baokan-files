Overseas Chinese Group Unanimously Denounces Rightists' Heinous Activities
Chen Jiageng's Supplementary Speech

　　After I came to Beijing last month to report, I submitted my speech to the General Assembly Secretariat before the adjournment of the General Assembly. At that time, I did not fully understand the reactionary conspiracy of the Rightists. Therefore, in my speech at the General Assembly, my main opinion was to eradicate bureaucracy. Later, after hearing the Rightists' fallacies of "Party's World," "Political Design Institute," "Rehabilitation Committee," and "Bureaucracy is more dangerous than Capitalism," I thought they were just fallacies at the time and did not understand the situation was so serious. After the opening of the National People's Congress, after listening to Premier Zhou's government work report and seeing the exposure of the crimes of the Zhang-Luo Alliance and other Rightists from all sides, and the Rightist leaders' own confessions, I realized that the Rightists' activities were programmatic and organized, opposing the Communist Party and opposing socialism, attempting to shake the foundation of the country and undermine the construction of the motherland. I was infinitely indignant. I immediately sent a letter to Chairman Mao, believing that their treasonous crimes must be severely punished according to the law, and they must not be tolerated because they are intellectuals, lest the people of the whole country despise right and wrong. Fortunately. The people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, must unswervingly take the socialist road. Our Overseas Chinese group has been discussing for days, based on this common belief, and unanimously denounces the criminal activities of the Rightists. In order to make the situation clearer to overseas Chinese, I am making this supplementary speech to the General Assembly.

    华侨小组一致痛斥右派罪恶活动
    陈嘉庚的补充发言
    我前月来京报到后，在大会延期未开前就将发言稿送大会秘书处，其时对右派反动阴谋尚未完全知情，故在大会发言，主要是根绝官僚主义的意见。迨后听到右派“党天下”、“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”、“官僚主义比资本主义还危险”的谬论，当时以为是谬论而已，不了解情形如此严重。全国人民代表大会开幕以后，听了周总理的政府工作报告，看到各方面对章罗联盟及其他右派的罪行的揭露，和右派头目自己的交代，才认识到右派的活动，是有纲领、有组织的，是反对共产党、反对社会主义，妄图动摇国本，破坏祖国的建设。我无限愤慨。即日呈函毛主席，认为彼等叛逆罪恶，必须依法严办，万不可以他们为知识分子而宽容，致全国人民轻视是非，幸甚。全国人民要在中国共产党领导下走社会主义道路是不可动摇的。我们华侨小组连日讨论，本此共同信念，对右派分子的罪恶活动，一致痛斥。为使国外华侨更明了情况，我特向大会作此补充发言。
