All Judicial Cadres Unite Around the Party to Thoroughly Crush the Rightists' Frenzied Attack
Shi Liang's Speech

    I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Prosecutor-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now I would like to offer some opinions on judicial work.

    People's Judicial Work Has Achieved Remarkable Success

    Since last year, people's judicial work, under the correct leadership of the Party and the state, relying on the support of the broad masses and the efforts of all judicial cadres, has achieved remarkable success. People's courts across the country have conscientiously, in accordance with the provisions of the People's Court Organization Law, tried a large number of criminal and civil cases, and correctly exerted their functions of exercising dictatorship over the enemy and mediating internal disputes among the people. At the same time, the state's legal system has been further implemented in judicial activities. According to incomplete statistics, more than 246,000 people's assessors have now been elected across the country; people's courts at all levels in Liaoning, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and other provinces have legally implemented the people's assessor system in 80% to 90% of their cases. Cases that are legally tried in public by people's courts at all levels account for more than 90% of all cases, the remainder being cases that should not be tried in public according to law. In addition to conscientiously protecting the defendant's right to defense, we have actively established a people's lawyer system to further safeguard the rights and legitimate interests of litigants. By the end of June this year, lawyer organizations had been established in the locations of higher and intermediate people's courts, cities with a population of more than 300,000, and county towns in a few rural areas. There are now 19 lawyer association preparatory committees, 820 legal advisory offices, and 2,528 lawyers and staff members nationwide. Lawyer work is very popular among the masses. Wherever the work is carried out well, legal advisory offices are overwhelmed with clients. In order to train reserve judicial cadres, in addition to the six law departments in comprehensive universities under the leadership of the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Justice also manages four political and legal colleges and has established three law schools in Shanghai, Jinan, and Chongqing; it is now strengthening the teaching staff and improving the quality of teaching to meet the needs of training judicial cadres. In addition, the people's courts and lawyer organizations have used all their activities to conduct extensive legal publicity to the masses. According to statistics from 151 units in four provinces and regions, including Jiangsu, last year alone, 2,474 legal lectures were given, with more than one million listeners. This has greatly helped to raise the awareness of cadres and the masses to abide by the law, to resolve disputes among the people, and to promote unity among the masses. This work must be strengthened in the future. It should be pointed out that although our work has made great achievements, there are still many shortcomings and errors, such as: the quality of handling cases is not high enough, there are delays in handling cases, some places do not implement various trial systems seriously enough, the quality of judicial cadres cannot fully meet the needs of current practical work, and the organization and business construction of lawyer work needs to be further strengthened, etc. We warmly welcome criticism from all sides, and we firmly believe that through this rectification movement, the shortcomings in judicial work will be greatly overcome.

    Rightists are Enthusiastic Spokespersons for Counter-Revolutionaries

    However, just as we were further examining and improving our work in accordance with Chairman Mao's great instruction on correctly handling contradictions among the people, bourgeois rightists such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Huang Shaohong, Long Yun, Chen Mingshu, etc., under the pretext of helping the Communist Party to rectify, launched a frenzied attack on us from all sides, among whom Luo Longji, Huang Shaohong, Tan Tiwu, Wang Zaoshi, Yang Zhaolong, Yang Yuqing and others launched vicious attacks on the people's judicial work under the leadership of the Party. They first focused their attack on our counter-revolutionary suppression work, saying that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was done poorly" and "done wrongly." They clamored everywhere, encouraging counter-revolutionaries to "reverse verdicts" and "cry injustice." Huang Shaohong showed extraordinary "concern" for judicial work, always posing as a defender of people's democracy and the legal system, but in fact, he was not interested in helping us improve our work, but was using his inspection work as an opportunity to collect individual "wrong case" materials and "cry injustice" for counter-revolutionaries everywhere. This person, who posed as a "Bao Longtu" for counter-revolutionaries and a "hero" in the eyes of counter-revolutionaries, not only spoke for counter-revolutionaries at last year's National People's Congress and this year's CPPCC, but also used his legal status to publicly exonerate counter-revolutionaries and engage in illegal activities. The recent exposure in the newspapers of his sheltering of counter-revolutionaries such as Xie Xin is the best illustration. In order to achieve their goal of exonerating counter-revolutionaries, Luo Longji proposed the establishment of a "Rehabilitation Committee" as a system of its own. That is to say, they attempted to transcend the state's legal people's judicial organs and get rid of the Party's leadership, and release in large numbers those deeply sinful counter-revolutionaries who had been arrested and sentenced. What a vicious conspiracy this is! Everyone knows that the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was completely necessary. I ask, if we had not carried out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, would we be able to live such a peaceful life today and build our socialism in peace and stability? Every honest person will give a correct answer. Of course, there were also shortcomings and errors in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, that is, there were individual wrongly judged cases, but the achievements were the main thing. This is an undeniable iron fact; and even if there were individual shortcomings and errors, we have not relaxed our efforts to correct them in the slightest. The people's courts in various places have seriously and conscientiously carried out or are carrying out the correction and handling of wrong cases in accordance with the principle of "errors must be corrected." This has been clearly and specifically explained in the reports of Premier Zhou and Prosecutor-General Zhang Dingcheng, and I fully agree with their assessment of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Why do the rightists turn a blind eye to the great achievements of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, but insist on exaggerating the shortcomings and errors in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries? Why are they so enthusiastic about being spokespersons for counter-revolutionaries? It turns out that they have ulterior motives.

    What the Rightists Want is American-Style Rule of Law

    The rightists say that we are "lawless" and "emphasize rule by man and disregard rule by law," saying that our country is not as "serious about the rule of law as the United States." It turns out that the rule of law they want is different from the rule of law we want. What they want is American-style rule of law. They also say that suppressing counter-revolutionaries is "unconstitutional" and "illegal." Whose "constitution" and whose "law" is this violating? If it is said that we have violated the constitution and laws of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is a fact, and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have forever and thoroughly abolished Chiang's constitution and the entire pseudo-legal system. This was expressly stipulated in Article 17 of the Common Program as early as 1949. If it is said that it is the constitution and laws of the People's Republic of China, then we have steadfastly implemented the provisions of Article 19 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and resolutely suppressed the activities of counter-revolutionaries; while actions like Huang Shaohong's "crying injustice" for counter-revolutionaries and Luo Longji's proposed "Rehabilitation Committee" are precisely violating the constitution's provisions on resolutely punishing counter-revolutionaries and that the power of adjudication is uniformly exercised by the people's courts. The rightists' opposition to our suppressing counter-revolutionaries and to our mobilizing the masses to expose counter-revolutionaries hiding in every corner is completely futile. The people of the whole country and the people's judicial organs, under the leadership of the Party, must resolutely suppress and handle counter-revolutionaries according to law at all times. We have, are, and will continue to adhere to the principle of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed." I advise the rightists to open their eyes and take a look. This is now the people's China, and it is no longer the old China under reactionary rule that you yearn for.

    Rightists are Clamoring to "Summon Back the Souls" of the Old Law

    The rightists not only oppose suppressing counter-revolutionaries, but also fundamentally oppose the people's democratic legal system. They say that judicial reform "strikes all the old judges, old prosecutors, and other old legal personnel with one blow," and criticize us for not "inheriting" the old law. They are clamoring to "summon back the souls" of the old law, to have the old legal personnel "return to the team," to revive the old law, and to have the old judicial personnel take the stage. They say that our trial personnel, especially those who grew up in the revolutionary struggle, "do not understand the law," have a "low level of Chinese," and "cannot write judgments," and that the quality of work of the old legal personnel "is still beyond the reach of today's judicial organs' serving cadres." Therefore, they are clamoring everywhere to have the people's judicial cadres "step down" and "get off the stage." Then who should "take the stage"? They want the rightists to "take the stage." Luo Longji said what was in his heart: "It would be more appropriate for me to run the Ministry of Justice." Is not the conspiracy of these rightists to usurp the people's judicial organs, this important weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship, very obvious? I solemnly warn the rightists that the people's democratic regime was bought with the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs, and we must firmly protect it. The state's power of adjudication must be firmly held in the hands of the people themselves. It is a delusion for the rightists to try to seize it. In fact, under the denunciation of the broad masses, their conspiracy has completely failed.

    The So-Called "Popular Grievances" are Just the "Grievances" of the Rightists

    The great achievements of judicial reform are well known. It has purified our judicial organs politically, ideologically, and organizationally, and is of great significance for the construction of the people's judicial work. I reported on this at the first session of this National People's Congress. Facts have proved that if we do not thoroughly abolish the old legal system, resolutely criticize the reactionary old legal viewpoints, and remove and transfer those old judicial personnel who are anti-Party, anti-people, anti-socialist, and unsuitable for people's judicial work from the people's judicial organs, then our judicial organs cannot be truly people's judicial organs, and our judicial work cannot meet the needs of the people and the needs of building socialism today. Of course, many of the old legal personnel are willing to reform. Our criticism of the old legal viewpoints is precisely to help them better serve the socialist cause of the motherland. Our judicial organs shoulder the serious and arduous task of suppressing the enemy, protecting the people, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and safeguarding the order of socialist construction. All personnel engaged in judicial work must be loyal to the people, loyal to socialism, and strictly abide by the state's laws and regulations. The vast majority of our existing judicial cadres are good. They serve the people diligently and cautiously. They have a clear class stand and are clear about the distinction between the enemy and ourselves. They conduct resolute and ingenious struggles against cunning criminals in court, and carefully and meticulously protect the interests of the people. In order to investigate and clarify the facts of the case, they often climb mountains and cross rivers, traveling many roads, sometimes even forgetting to eat. Although their work is so hard, they are still enthusiastic and work actively. How can all these excellent qualities of the people's judicial cadres be compared with the judges in the Kuomintang reactionary government offices and all the reactionary courts that oppressed the people? Although some of them still lack sufficient legal and scientific knowledge and their policy level is not high, they have made significant progress and improvements in the work practice of the past few years through training. In addition to the Central and Northeast, Northwest, and Central South Political and Legal Cadre Schools, provinces and cities have also run cadre training courses. In recent years, more than 20,000 cadres have been trained in central and provincial-level business training institutions. At the same time, we also organized in-service cadres to study on their own. The majority of in-service cadres have studied the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism on the theory of state and law, and various current laws, regulations, and related policies. Since last year, we have also strengthened business learning and promoted the system of commending advanced workers and promoting advanced work experience. All of this is not to say that our judicial cadres are basically able to correctly handle cases according to law and are working hard to improve? Then why do the rightists spread rumors and curse our cadres everywhere, saying that "it is not enough to quell the people's anger without them stepping down"? I ask, what "popular grievances" do our judicial cadres have? It is clear that it is precisely because we resolutely implement our people's democratic legal system, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and oppose the remnants of old legal viewpoints and old government office styles that the rightists are quite saddened. If it is said that it is "popular grievances," then it is obviously not the "grievances" of the people, but the "grievances" of the rightists!

    Don't Let Young People Fall For Their Tricks

    In order to fundamentally change the organizational composition of the people's judicial organs, the rightists also attempted to control and manipulate the education of political and legal departments. They called the reform of legal education and the adjustment of departments "sectarianism" and "doctrinairism," saying that teaching reform was "striking the old legal experts with one blow," and some even alarmingly said that China's legal education "has regressed by 20 years." I ask, what was legal education like 20 years ago? What was taught and learned at that time? What kind of talent was cultivated? I was a student at an old law school. As far as I know, old legal education was not only for cultivating "talent" to serve the reactionary ruling class, but also many students could get a diploma without attending classes. Today, our political and legal departments are not training "talent" for the reactionary ruling class, but cultivating political and legal work cadres for the people's regime. We have reformed the old bourgeois legal education system, put forward serious requirements for students, and opened many new courses. This has never happened in the history of Chinese legal education, and its content and nature are fundamentally different from the past. Is all of this "regressing by 20 years"? The purpose of the rightists is to have students in schools learn the laws of bourgeois countries, the laws of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and not to learn socialist laws and laws that serve the people. To this end, they also drafted a set of plans to restore the old legal education and prepared a list of rightists in power. They want to "drive out the Party thugs" in the political and legal departments, curse the old cadres as "eating Party food," saying that they cannot engage in legal teaching work, saying that "the old cadres of the political and legal colleges regard the old intellectuals as landlords and capitalists, and adopt a policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation," and even say that people who teach the old law are like "slaves." In fact, the Party values all old legal experts who are willing to serve socialism. In the political and legal departments, there are now not only many old professors teaching classes, but some also shoulder more important positions, but the rightists are ignoring the facts, maliciously distorting the Party's policy towards intellectuals, provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses in the legal field, and opposing the Communist Party. They are also spreading rumors and inciting trouble among students in the political and legal departments, saying that non-Party members and non-League members cannot be judges, and that graduates from political and legal departments can only be clerks, etc. Let's take the Beijing Intermediate People's Court as an example! There are a total of 52 judges and assistant judges in this court, including 17 Party members, 11 League members, and the remaining 24 are non-Party members and non-League members. How can this be said that the political and legal departments are "all the same"? Let's take the Beijing Intermediate People's Court as an example again. A total of 10 graduates from political and legal departments have been assigned to the court in recent years, and they are all now working as judges. It should be explained that the work of clerks is an important part of the entire trial work, and I think it is necessary for students who have just graduated from university to be clerks. This is beneficial to cultivating their practical working ability and making them familiar with trial business. Now some people underestimate the work of clerks, which is wrong. One of the training goals of the political and legal departments is to train talents who can take on trial work. The rightists are attempting to use this to incite students in the political and legal departments to make trouble and take the opportunity to usurp the Party's leadership over the political and legal departments. We must resolutely fight back and not let young people fall for their tricks.

    Resolutely Smash the Rightists' Sinister Conspiracy

    From the above, it can be seen that the rightists' conspiracy is to restore the old legal system in our country and seize the weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship. They oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose the people's democratic legal system in order to carry out capitalist restoration. This sinister conspiracy can no longer be concealed. We must resolutely and thoroughly smash it! The people's judicial work must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, further strive to consolidate our country's people's democratic dictatorship. All judicial cadres must closely unite around the Party, overcome the shortcomings in their work, and thoroughly crush the rightists' frenzied attack against the Party, the people, and socialism! At the same time, we hope that the rightists will repent as soon as possible and not cut themselves off from the people.

    Finally, I want to solemnly and clearly state that we must take the socialist road! We must have the leadership of the Communist Party!

### 全体司法干部团结在党的周围  彻底打垮右派分子的猖狂进攻  史良的发言

    全体司法干部团结在党的周围  彻底打垮右派分子的猖狂进攻
    史良的发言
    我完全同意周总理、李先念、薄一波副总理和张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长的报告。现在我想就司法工作讲一点意见。
    人民司法工作取得了显著的成绩
    去年以来，人民司法工作在党和国家的正确领导下，依靠了广大群众的支持和全体司法干部的努力，取得了显著的成绩。全国各地人民法院，认真地按照人民法院组织法的规定，审理了大量的刑、民事案件，正确地发挥了对敌人实行专政和调处人民内部纠纷的职能。同时，在审判活动中更进一步贯彻了国家的法制。据不完全统计，现在全国已选出人民陪审员二十四万六千多人；辽宁、浙江、安徽、福建等省各级人民法院，已经有80％到90％的案件，依法实行了人民陪审员制度。各级人民法院依法实行公开审理的案件，已占全部案件的90％以上，其余是依法不应实行公开审理的。除了认真保护被告人的辩护权外，我们积极地建设了人民律师制度，以进一步维护诉讼当事人的权利和合法利益。到今年6月底为止，在高级和中级人民法院所在地、人口在30万以上的市和少数农村地区的县城，均已建立了律师组织，现全国已有律师协会筹委会19个，法律顾问处820处，律师和工作人员2，528人。律师工作深受群众欢迎，凡是工作开展得好的地方，法律顾问处接待当事人都是应接不暇的。为了培养后备司法干部，除了高教部领导的设在综合大学内的六个法律系外，司法部还管理有四个政法学院，并在上海、济南、重庆三地建立了三所法律学校；现正加强师资的力量，提高教学质量，以适应培养司法干部的需要。此外，人民法院和律师组织，还运用自己的全部活动，广泛地向群众进行了法律宣传。仅据江苏等四个省区的151个单位统计，去年一年，光法律讲演就作了2，474次，听众达百万人以上。这就大大有助于提高干部和群众的守法观念，有助于解决人民内部的纠纷和促进群众之间的团结。这一工作今后必须加强。应当指出，我们的工作虽然有很大成绩，但是也还存在不少缺点和错误，例如：办案质量还不够高，办案也有不及时的现象，有的地方执行各项审判制度还不够认真，司法干部的质量还不能完全满足当前实际工作的需要，律师工作的组织与业务建设还需进一步加强等等。我们热忱地欢迎各方面的批评，我们坚信，通过这次整风运动，司法工作中所存在的缺点将得到很大的克服。
    右派分子热心作反革命分子的代言人
    但是，正当我们根据毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的伟大指示，进一步检查和改进工作的时候，资产阶级右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、黄绍竑、龙云、陈铭枢等借口帮助共产党整风，从四面八方向我们猖狂进攻，其中罗隆基、黄绍竑、谭惕吾、王造时、杨兆龙、杨玉清等人向党领导下的人民司法工作开展了恶毒的攻击。他们首先集中攻击了我们的肃反工作，说“肃反搞糟了”，“搞错了”，他们到处叫嚷，鼓励反革命分子“翻案”、“叫冤”。黄绍竑对于司法工作表现了异常的“关心”，一直装着人民民主法制维护者的样子，其实他感觉兴趣的并不是怎样帮助我们改进工作，他是利用视察工作的机会，搜集个别的“错案”材料，到处替反革命分子“鸣冤”。这位俨然以反革命分子的“包龙图”自居和反革命分子眼中的“英雄”，不仅在去年的人大和今年的政协会议上，替反革命分子说话，而且他还利用自己的合法地位，公开为反革命分子开脱罪责，干出违法的勾当。最近报纸上揭发的他庇护反革命分子谢昕等事例，就是最好的说明。右派分子为了达到他们开脱反革命分子的目的，罗隆基就提出要成立一个自成系统的“平反委员会”。这就是说，他们企图超越国家法定的人民司法机关并摆脱党的领导，把那些罪恶深重已被逮捕、判刑的反革命分子，大批放掉。这是一个多么毒辣的阴谋啊！大家都知道，肃反运动是完全必要的，试问，如果不搞肃反运动，我们今天能够过这样平静的日子，能够安安稳稳地建设我们的社会主义吗？每一个正直的人，都会作出正确的答复。当然肃反运动中也有缺点和错误，即有个别错判的案件，但是成绩是主要的，这是不容否认的铁的事实；而且即令是个别缺点和错误，我们亦丝毫没有放松纠正的工作。各地人民法院对于错案已本着“有错必纠”的方针，严肃认真地进行了或者正在进行纠正和处理。这在周总理和张鼎丞检察长的报告中已经作了明确而具体的说明，我完全同意他们对于肃反运动所作的估价。右派分子为什么对肃反运动的伟大成绩视而不见，却偏偏要夸大肃反运动中的缺点和错误呢？为什么那么热心作反革命分子的代言人呢？原来他们是别有用心的。
    右派分子要的是美国式的法治
    右派分子说我们是“无法无天”，是“重人治而轻法治”，说我国不及“美国法治认真”，原来他们所要的法治同我们所要的法治不一样，他们要的是美国式的法治。他们又说镇压反革命是“违宪”、“违法”，这是违的什么人的“宪”、什么人的“法”呢？如果说我们是违了国民党反动派之宪、之法，那是事实，而且中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，已经永远和彻底地废除了蒋记宪法和整个伪法统，这早在1949年的共同纲领第十七条中作了明文规定。如果要说是中华人民共和国之宪、之法，那末，我们是坚定不移地执行了中华人民共和国宪法第十九条的规定，坚决镇压了反革命的活动；而像黄绍竑之类这样为反革命分子“鸣冤”和罗隆基所要成立的“平反委员会”，却正是违反了宪法关于坚决惩办反革命分子和审判权统一由人民法院行使的规定。右派分子反对我们肃清反革命，反对我们发动群众把隐藏在各个角落的反革命分子揭露出来，是完全徒劳的。全国人民和人民的司法机关在党的领导下，对于反革命分子，在任何时候都是必须坚决加以肃清和依法处理的，我们过去是、现在是、将来还是坚持“有反必肃”的方针。我劝右派分子睁开眼睛看一看，现在是人民的中国，早已不是你们所向往的反动统治的旧中国了。
    右派分子大声疾呼要为旧法“招魂”
    右派分子不只是反对镇压反革命，而且从根本上反对人民民主法制。他们说司法改革对旧法官、旧检察官和其他旧法人员是“一棍子打死”，责备我们对旧法不“继承”，他们大声疾呼要为旧法“招魂”，要旧法人员“归队”，使旧法复活，旧司法人员上台。他们说我们的审判人员，特别是从革命斗争中成长起来的审判人员“不懂法律”、“中文水平低”、“不会写判决”，说旧法人员的工作质量“还是今天司法机关在职干部所不及的”。因此，他们就到处叫嚷要人民的司法干部“下轿”、“下台”。那末要谁“上台”呢？他们是要右派分子“上台”，罗隆基说出了心底话：“我搞司法部还恰当些”。这些右派分子企图篡夺人民司法机关这个人民民主专政的重要武器的阴谋，不是非常明显的吗？我严正地警告右派分子，人民民主政权是无数革命先烈用鲜血换来的，我们一定要牢牢地保护它，国家的审判权，一定要紧紧地掌握在人民自己的手里，右派分子要夺取是妄想。事实上，在广大群众的声讨下，他们的阴谋是完全破产了。
    所谓“民愤”不过是右派分子之“愤”罢了
    司法改革的巨大成绩是人所共知的，它从政治上、思想上、组织上纯洁了我们的司法机关，对于人民司法工作的建设具有重大的意义。这一点，我在本届全国人民代表大会的第一次会议上曾做过报告。事实证明，如果我们不彻底地废除旧法统，坚决地批判反动的旧法观点，并把那些反党、反人民、反社会主义和不适宜作人民司法工作的旧司法人员，清除和调出人民的司法机关，那末，我们的司法机关，就不可能是真正的人民司法机关，我们的司法工作，就不能合乎人民的要求，合乎今天建设社会主义的要求。当然，旧法人员中有很多是愿意改造的，我们批判旧法观点，也正是为了帮助他们能更好地为祖国社会主义事业服务。我们的司法机关担负着镇压敌人、保护人民、巩固人民民主专政、保障社会主义建设秩序的严肃而又繁重的任务，一切从事司法工作的人员，必须是忠于人民、忠于社会主义的严守国家法纪的人。我们现有的司法干部，绝大多数是好的，他们勤恳、谨慎地为人民服务，他们具有鲜明的阶级立场，敌我分明；他们在法庭上对诡计多端的罪犯进行着坚决而机智的斗争，对人民的利益则谨慎而仔细地保卫着；他们为了调查弄清案情，往往登山涉水，跑很多路，有时连饭也顾不上吃。虽然他们的工作那样辛苦，但仍然是热情饱满，积极工作。人民司法干部所有这些优良品质，岂是国民党反动衙门和一切压迫人民的反动法院中的法官老爷们所可比拟的吗？他们中虽然有些人还缺乏足够的法律科学知识，政策水平还不高，但在几年来的工作实践中经过培养和锻炼，都有了显著的进步和提高。我们除了举办了中央和东北、西北、中南政法干部学校外，各省、市还开办了干部轮训班。几年来，在职司法干部经过中央和省一级的业务训练机构训练的干部已达两万余名。同时，我们还组织了在职干部的业务自修，广大在职干部都学习了马克思列宁主义关于国家与法的理论等基本知识，和各项现行的法律、法令及有关的政策。去年以来，还加强了业务学习，推行了表扬先进工作者和推广先进工作经验等制度。所有这些，不正是说明我们的司法干部在基本上是能够依法正确地处理案件并正在努力提高吗？那么右派分子为什么要到处造谣咒骂我们这些干部，说我们“不下台不足以平民愤”呢？试问，我们的司法干部有什么“民愤”呢。很清楚，就是因为我们坚决地执行我国人民民主法制，镇压了反革命，反对了残存的旧法观点和旧衙门作风，因而使右派分子颇为伤心。如果要说是“民愤”的话，那显然不是人民群众之“愤”，而是右派分子之“愤”罢了！
    不让青年上他们的当
    右派分子为了要从根本上改变人民司法机关的组织成分，他们还企图控制和把持政法院系的教育。他们把法学教育的改革和院系调整叫作“宗派主义”、“教条主义”，说教学改革是“把旧法学家一棍子打死了”，甚至有人危言耸听地说我国法学教育“已经倒退20年”。请问，20年前法学教育是怎样的呢？当时教的、学的都是些什么？培养些什么样的人才呢？我是在旧的法律学校当过学生的，据我所知，旧的法学教育不仅是为了培养为反动统治阶级服务的“人才”，而且有许多学生不上课就可以拿到毕业证书。今天，我们的政法院系，不是为反动统治阶级训练“人才”，而是为人民政权培养政法工作干部。我们把旧的资产阶级的法学教育制度加以改革，对学生提出了严肃的要求，开设了许多新的课程，这是中国法学教育史上从来没有过的，其内容与性质更是与过去根本不相同的。所有这些，难道是“倒退20年”了吗？右派分子的目的就是要学校的学生去学习资产阶级国家的法律、国民党反动派的法律，而不要学习社会主义的法律、为人民服务的法律。他们为此还拟定了一套恢复旧法学教育的方案，并且准备了右派分子掌权的名单。他们要在政法院系中
  “驱逐党棍子”，咒骂老干部是“吃党饭”，说他们不能搞法律教学工作，说“政法学院老干部把旧知识分子看成地主、资本家，采用的是利用、限制、改造政策”，甚至说教旧法的人好像“奴隶”一样。事实上，党对一切愿意为社会主义服务的老法学家是重视的，在政法院系中，现在不但有不少老教授正在开课教书，有的还担负着更多的重要职务，而右派分子竟然抹煞事实，恶意地歪曲党对知识分子的政策，挑拨法学界的党群关系，反对共产党。他们还在政法院系的学生中，造谣点火，说不是党团员不能当审判员，政法院系的毕业生只能当书记员等等。我们就以北京市中级人民法院为例来看吧！这个法院里共有审判员和助理审判员52人，其中党员17人，团员11人，其余24人都是非党团员。这怎么能说政法部门“清一色”呢？我们再以北京市中级人民法院为例，几年来先后分配到该院的政法院系毕业生共10人，现在都担任着审判员的工作。应当说明，书记员的工作，是整个审判工作中的一个重要的组成部分，刚从大学毕业的学生当书记员，我认为是必要的，这对于培养他们的实际工作能力，使他们熟悉审判业务，都有好处。现在有些人轻视书记员的工作是错误的。政法院系的培养目标，其中有一项就是培养能够担任审判工作的人才的。右派分子竟企图以此来煽动政法院系学生闹事，乘机篡夺党对政法院系的领导，我们必须坚决地予以反击，不让青年上他们的当。
    坚决粉碎右派分子的罪恶阴谋
    由上可见，右派分子的阴谋是要在我国恢复旧法统，夺取人民民主专政的武器，他们反对共产党的领导，反对人民民主法制，以便实行资本主义复辟。这个罪恶的阴谋，现在是无法再掩盖的了，我们必须坚决彻底地加以粉碎！人民的司法工作，必须在共产党领导下，必须进一步地为巩固我国的人民民主专政而努力。全体司法干部，必须紧密地团结在党的周围，克服自己工作中的缺点，彻底打垮右派分子反党、反人民、反社会主义的猖狂进攻！同时，我们希望右派分子及早悔悟，不要自绝于人民。
    最后，我还要严正而明确的讲，我们一定要走社会主义的道路！一定要共产党的领导！
