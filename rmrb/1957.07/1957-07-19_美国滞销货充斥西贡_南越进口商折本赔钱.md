Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 18th: According to Saigon newspapers, over 40,000 tons of American goods, including cloth, flour, condensed milk, and cigarettes, are currently stockpiled in Saigon's dock warehouses. However, 1,500 to 3,000 tons of American consumer goods continue to flood into Saigon daily.

The majority of these overstocked goods were imported under the U.S. "Aid" program for the second quarter. According to this program, South Vietnam will import over 40 million U.S. dollars worth of American goods in this quarter, with cloth accounting for the largest share at 7.5 million U.S. dollars, followed by condensed milk, powdered milk, flour, and sugar, with dairy products alone accounting for 4.2 million U.S. dollars.

Due to the limited sales of American consumer goods in South Vietnam, South Vietnamese importers dealing in these commodities are suffering significant losses and are constantly complaining. Recently, South Vietnamese importers collectively wrote to Ngo Dinh Diem's Ministry of Economy, requesting a change to the U.S. "Aid" import program, seeking ways to export the surplus flour and condensed milk to neighboring countries, and immediately returning the large deposits to the importers.

    美国滞销货充斥西贡  南越进口商折本赔钱
    据新华社河内18日讯  据西贡报纸报道，西贡码头仓库中目前积存的美国布匹、面粉、炼乳、纸烟等货物已经超过四万吨。但是，每天仍然有一千五百到三千吨的美国消费品涌到西贡。
    这些因滞销而积压下来的货物大部分是根据美国第二季度“援助”计划进口的。按照这项计划，在这一季度中南越将进口四千多万美元的美国货物，其中布匹最多，占七百五十万美元，其次是炼乳、奶粉、面粉和糖，单奶制品一项就占四百二十万美元。
    由于美国消费品在南越销路不广，经营这些商品的南越进口商遭到很大亏损，叫苦连天。最近，南越进口商已经集体写信给吴庭艳的经济部，要求改变美“援”的进口计划，设法把过剩的面粉、炼乳输往邻近国家，并且立即退还进口商的大量押金。
