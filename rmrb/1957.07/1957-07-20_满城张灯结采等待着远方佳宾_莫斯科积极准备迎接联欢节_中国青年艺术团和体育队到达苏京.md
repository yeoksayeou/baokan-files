    Moscow is actively preparing to welcome distinguished guests participating in the Festival. (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th)

    Every district in Moscow is festooned with lanterns and decorations, competing to see which street and which building is the most beautifully decorated. Many districts have moved large quantities of flowers, plants, and trees from outside the city, giving each courtyard and street garden a completely new look. In the Shcherbakov district, where the delegates' dormitories are located, more than two thousand young people participate in voluntary labor every day, opening up countless lawns, flowerbeds, and tree-lined paths. It is estimated that young people throughout the city have recently planted no fewer than eight million flowers. Many residents have also ingeniously decorated their houses.

    To help foreign delegates visit Moscow's famous historical sites and scenic spots, a large number of young people have volunteered to serve as guides. During the Festival, two hundred large-scale city-wide tours will be organized for foreign delegates. Famous museums are preparing to receive guests from various countries. The interior of the Lenin Museum Gallery has been renovated, and foreign language guidebooks and picture albums have been published. In addition to the museum staff, more than five hundred university students will serve as guides, explaining to guests in English, French, German, and other languages.

    Bookstore clerks and library managers will also do their part to welcome foreign friends. Each library has compiled a special Festival book catalog and has organized relevant books about the country responsible for the reception in this district, so that young people in the district can understand the country's history, literature, and art.

    (Special dispatch from our newspaper in Moscow, 19th) The Chinese Youth Art Troupe and Sports Team, a group of more than 400 people, who came to participate in the Sixth World Youth Festival, arrived in Moscow by train today. They were warmly welcomed by the Moscow City Committee of the Soviet Komsomol and the youth of the Moscow Proletarian District.

    Today, the weather in Moscow was clear, and the Yaroslavl Station was filled with a festive atmosphere, with Chinese and Soviet national flags and Festival flags hanging everywhere. Timofeeva, Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Komsomol, warmly said at the welcoming ceremony that Soviet youth warmly welcomed the arrival of Chinese youth guests, and Chinese comrades would feel at home in Moscow. Zhou Weizhi, head of the Chinese Youth Art Troupe, said: "We have come to Moscow for world peace, to strengthen mutual understanding and make friends with young people from all countries, and also to learn." Then he congratulated the close fraternal friendship between the people and youth of China and the Soviet Union and wished the Festival a complete success.

    据新华社莫斯科19日电  莫斯科人民正在积极准备迎接参加联欢节的远方客人。
    莫斯科各区都在张灯结采，比赛那一条街、那一所房子装饰得最美丽。许多区从城外移来大批花草林木，把每个庭院、街心花园布置得面目一新。代表们宿舍所在地的谢尔巴科夫区每天有两千多青年参加义务劳动，辟出无数的草地、花畦和林荫路。估计全市青年最近栽种的花不下八百万株。许多居民也独出心裁地把房子装饰起来。
    为了帮助外国代表参观莫斯科名胜古迹，大批的青少年自动要求担任向导。联欢节期间将组织外国代表进行二百次大规模的全城参观。著名博物馆正在进行接待各国客人参观的准备。列宁博物馆画廊内部都进行了整理，出版了外国文的导游指南和画册。除各博物馆的工作人员外，五百多个大学生将担任导游员，用英、法、德等国的语言向客人们解说。
    书店店员和图书馆管理人员也要为接待外国朋友的工作尽一份力量。各个图书馆编制了专门的联欢节图书目录，并且把本区负责接待的国家的有关书籍整理出来，便于本区青年了解该国的历史、文学、艺术。
    本报莫斯科19日专电  前来参加第六届世界青年联欢节的中国青年艺术团和体育队一行四百多人，于今天乘火车到达莫斯科。他们受到了苏联共青团莫斯科市委和莫斯科无产阶级区青年的热烈欢迎。
    今天，莫斯科天气晴朗，雅罗斯拉夫车站洋溢着节日的气氛，到处悬挂着中苏两国国旗和联欢节的旗帜。共青团莫斯科市委书记季莫菲耶娃在欢迎会上热情地说，苏联青年热烈欢迎中国青年客人们的来临，中国同志们在莫斯科将会感到像在自己家里一样。中国青年艺术团团长周巍峙说：“我们到莫斯科是为世界和平来的，是为了同各国青年加强互相了解和交朋友来的，也是为了学习来的。”接着他祝贺中苏两国人民和青年的亲密无间的兄弟友谊，并预祝联欢节胜利成功。
