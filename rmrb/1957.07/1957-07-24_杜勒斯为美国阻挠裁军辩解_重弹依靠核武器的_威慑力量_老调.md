Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 23rd: Dulles said on July 22nd that the United States believes that guaranteeing the abolition of nuclear weapons is unworkable.

Dulles delivered a television speech to the nation that day to "clarify its attitude" on the issue of disarmament. He stated that the United States' starting point remains the possible use of nuclear weapons in war, and the United States will continue to rely on the "deterrent" of nuclear weapons. Therefore, nuclear weapons testing must also continue.

Dulles attempted to portray the Soviet Union's proposals in the talks as "completely unworkable" and defended the US's attitude of obstructing a genuine disarmament agreement.

Dulles explained the four suggestions currently put forward by the United States:

One, the United States proposes establishing a system of inspection. The United States is prepared to accept inspection of all its territory in North America in exchange for inspection of the Soviet Union. The United States is also prepared to consider establishing limited areas that can gradually expand. For example, an initial area could include the area within the Arctic Circle and the corresponding parts of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, as well as Eastern Siberia, the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Kuril Islands.

Two, the United States suggests taking a triple action on the atomic nucleus. Dulles said that the United States "does not propose to eliminate nuclear weapons or eliminate the possibility of using such weapons."

Three, the United States is ready to begin reducing and adjusting non-nuclear armaments and armed forces, and suggests limiting the military personnel of the Soviet Union and the United States to no more than 2.5 million each.

Four, it is suggested to formulate a system to "ensure" that "space missiles" are used entirely for "peaceful and scientific purposes."

Dulles said that these "initial" steps proposed by the United States are "limited," and further disarmament steps will depend on resolving political issues. He said, "Research on arms limitation and research on political solutions must be carried out together."

### 杜勒斯为美国阻挠裁军辩解  重弹依靠核武器的“威慑力量”老调

    杜勒斯为美国阻挠裁军辩解
    重弹依靠核武器的“威慑力量”老调
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：杜勒斯7月22日说，美国认为，保证废止核武器是行不通的。
    杜勒斯这一天就裁军问题向全国发表了一篇“澄清态度”的电视演说。他表示，美国的出发点仍然是在战争中有可能使用核武器，美国仍然要依靠核武器的“威慑力量”，因此，核武器试验也必须继续进行。
    杜勒斯企图把苏联在会谈中提出的建议说成是“完全行不通的”，而为美国自己阻挠达成真正裁军协议的态度辩护。
    杜勒斯说明美国目前提出的四点建议是：
    一、美国建议建立一种视察制度。美国准备接受对它在北美的全部领土的视察，以视察苏联为交换条件。美国也准备考虑建立有限的能够逐渐扩大的地区，例如，一个初期的地区可以包括北极圈以内的地区和阿拉斯加及阿留申群岛，以及东西伯利亚、堪察加半岛和千岛群岛的相应部分。
    二、美国建议在原子核方面采取一个三重行动。杜勒斯说，美国“并不建议消灭核武器，或者消除使用这种武器的可能性”。
    三、美国准备着手裁减和调整非核军备和武装部队，建议把苏美两国军事人员限制为各不超过二百五十万人。
    四、建议拟定制度，“保证”把“太空导弹”完全用于“和平和科学目的”。
    杜勒斯说，美国建议采取的这些“开端”步骤是“有限制的”，要再进一步采取裁军步骤就要取决于解决政治问题。他说，“军备限制方面的研究和政治解决方面的研究必须一道进行。”
