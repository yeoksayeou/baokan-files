(Xinhua News Agency, July 10th) At the news work symposium continuing today, Pu Xixiu began to make some confessions.

    **In Order to Grasp Big Intellectuals, Luo Longji Wanted to Be Minister of Higher Education**

    Pu Xixiu said: The Zhang-Luo alliance was organized and planned. Last August in Beidaihe, their primary goal was to usurp leadership within the league. Their strategy was to attack the left, win over the middle, and unite the right. They vehemently attacked Vice-Chairman Shi Liang, believed that Chairman Shen Junru should retire, and considered Vice-Chairman Gao Chongmin insignificant. Luo Longji even secretly discussed with Zeng Zhaolun how to arrange personnel within the league, encouraging Zeng to engage more in league affairs and less in outside matters. They also negotiated to use the grassroots organizations of the China Democratic League to get intellectuals in various universities into their hands. After returning to Beijing, Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun personally went to universities to conduct activities, Luo went to Renmin University, and Zhang went to the Railway Institute. Luo Longji also held many intellectual get-together seminars, inviting people with problems and many opinions. Luo even claimed to seek justice for these people. Pu Xixiu said: After the China Democratic League's National Work Conference in April, Luo Longji was very happy, saying that party members should withdraw from the league, and democratic parties could truly achieve organizational independence and political freedom from then on; the democratic parties had great prospects. Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji always felt that being Minister of Forest Industries was beneath his talents. In the early days of liberation, he wanted to be Minister of Foreign Affairs, then Minister of Justice; now, Luo Longji was wholeheartedly thinking of becoming Minister of Higher Education, believing that this would enable him to better grasp the big intellectuals.

    Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji's rightist clique became more hidden after the Zhang Dongsun incident. Luo Longji and Zeng Zhaolun had the closest relationship. Luo Longji's public speeches would all be discussed with Fei Xiaotong, Pan Guangdan, and Wu Jingchao. Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji paid special attention to the China Democratic League organizations in Shanghai and the Southwest. When I went to Shanghai in 1950, he asked me to bring letters to Peng Wenyin and Zhao Wenbi, telling them to unite and strive for electoral victory to avoid benefiting from their disunity. When I went to Shanghai in 1953 and 1954, Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, Zhao Wenbi, and Lu Yi of Luo Longji's clique all treated me to meals. They all hoped I would convey to Luo Longji that they had a lot of grievances. Some people felt that their work arrangements were inappropriate, and Lu Yi also hoped that Wenhui Daily and Xinmin Evening News would cooperate better. Luo Longji often boasted to me that arranging for Pan Dakui to work in Sichuan and arranging for me to work in the Wenhui Daily office were his most skillful achievements.

    **Luo Longji Considered Arranging for Pu Xixiu to Work at Wenhui Daily His "Proud Masterpiece"**

    Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji tried every means to get me to do the work of the Wenhui Daily office, not allowing me to study or work for other newspapers and periodicals. On April 2nd last year, Luo Longji wrote to me from Moscow, telling me that in the personnel arrangement of Wenhui Daily, "don't be too honest, you should fight for what you should fight for." Last October, when Wenhui Daily resumed publication, he said to me again: "Wenhui Daily is a newspaper with great prospects, this should be your life's work, don't complain anymore about me arranging you to work in the Wenhui Daily office." Luo Longji also instructed his confidant Liu Guanghua to come to work at the Wenhui Daily office and wanted to give Liu important responsibilities. Later, during the rectification campaign, Liu Guanghua lit fires everywhere. When Wenhui Daily resumed publication, the original idea was to focus on middle-level intellectuals while also considering big intellectuals, but Luo Longji believed that more big intellectuals should be cultivated to represent them and speak for them more. We also followed his advice. Therefore, Wenhui Daily implemented the "speaking out freely as the main focus" policy of the Zhang-Luo alliance from the very beginning of its resumption of publication. Luo Longji also told us not to listen to the party group. We told him that the party group had changed personnel, but he said: "Regardless of whether the personnel change or not, the party group is always the party group." In my work, I always asked him for advice. We had phone calls every day. He often slandered party member responsible cadres in front of me. It was because of this that I refused the introduction of party members from the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee to work in the Wenhui Daily office.

    **Luo Longji Personally Commanded Who to Organize to Write What Articles**

    Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji also controlled the Wenhui Daily office in terms of organizing and writing articles. For example, on the issue of the scientific system, Luo told me on the phone that the "Contending" editorial department had just held a symposium on the scientific system, and you can send someone to talk to Qian Weichang. For example, on the issue of school party committees, he told us to find Fei Xiaotong; on the issue of reactionary sociology, he told us to find Li Jinghan, and so on. I also talked to him about the report on the "Peking University Democracy Wall."

    **Many People Spoke, Listing Facts and Believing That Pu Xixiu's Confession Was Not Thorough Enough**

    After Pu Xixiu's confession, Xuan Dizhi of Xinhua News Agency, Ye Gang, a reporter for Wenhui Daily, Xu Yian of Guangming Daily, and Zhu Bin of the Xinhua News Agency Beijing Branch spoke one after another. They said that it was good that Pu Xixiu was able to confess part of the situation, but they also cited many facts to show that Pu Xixiu's confession was not thorough enough, and they hoped that she would continue to confess.

    Ye Gang said: For a long time, Pu Xixiu's remarks in the Wenhui Daily office were Luo Longji's remarks. Wenhui Daily relied on the rightists of the China Democratic League and promoted the views of the rightists of the China Democratic League. Since the resumption of publication of Wenhui Daily, Pu Xixiu had wanted to absorb all the editors and reporters of the Wenhui Daily Beijing office into the China Democratic League organization. Ye Gang then cited some specific examples of Pu Xixiu's instructions to him in his interviews, explaining the situation in which Pu Xixiu promoted rightist views in specific business. Ye Gang said that the Wenhui Daily Beijing office was in the rightist network of the China Democratic League from its policy, organization to its specific business, but Pu Xixiu's confession was still evasive.

    Xu Yian of Guangming Daily revealed at the meeting that Pu Xixiu had met with Lou Bangyan, Peng Zigang, and Fei Xiaotong to discuss writing articles to refute the People's Daily's criticism of Chu Anping. He said: Pu Xixiu should confess things like this, but she did not. Xu Yian also said that Lou Bangyan had said that what Peng Zigang said at the meeting that day was completely rightist remarks.

    Zhu Bin of the Xinhua News Agency Beijing Branch exposed Pu Xixiu's attack on the state news agency. She said: In mid-May, Pu Xixiu sent two people to the Xinhua News Agency Beijing Branch to solicit articles. They repeatedly emphasized that they wanted articles that could "uncover the lid" and provoke "speaking out freely"; and said that any form would do, as long as it could play the role of "uncovering the lid." They also specifically pointed out some units and wanted us to "uncover the lid" for them.

    Xu Zhucheng continued to confess at the meeting today. He said that his exclusion of party members and opposition to the leadership of the party was consistent, but in the short 20 days after returning to Shanghai from the Soviet Union on May 14, his anti-party words and deeds developed to an extremely serious level. He said that on the third day of returning to Shanghai, he attended the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Work Conference and heard the rightist Lu Yi attacking the Communist Party members of Xinmin Evening News by name, which resonated with him ideologically. Xu Zhucheng said that he had repeatedly proposed to clarify the division of labor of the editorial board under the pretext of "the party replacing the government" at the newspaper's editorial board meeting, attempting to weaken the leadership role of Qin Benli, the party member deputy editor-in-chief, in the editorial department. Later, he rudely interfered with Qin Benli's work several times, and even proposed that Qin Benli be in charge of the second page exclusively. When the Wenhui Daily Party Group was established, Xu Zhucheng was concerned that it would hinder his arbitrary decision-making. After Chu Anping's fallacy of "the party's world" was published, Xu immediately convened the editorial board to discuss the newspaper's future practices, believing that Wenhui Daily's bourgeois orientation at that time was not enough, and even wanted to run Wenhui Daily into a so-called folk newspaper that sang against the party.

    Xu Zhucheng also revealed some of the relationship between Pu Xixiu and Luo Longji.

    After Xu Zhucheng spoke, Zou Fanyang of Xinmin Evening News, Zhu Youshi of the Journalism Department of Renmin University, Gao Ji of the People's Daily, and many others spoke one after another, raising many questions to Xu Zhucheng.
