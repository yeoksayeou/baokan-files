(Xinhua News Agency, July 10th) At the news work symposium continuing today, Pu Xixiu began to make some confessions.

    **In Order to Grasp Big Intellectuals, Luo Longji Wanted to Be Minister of Higher Education**

    Pu Xixiu said: The Zhang-Luo alliance was organized and planned. Last August in Beidaihe, their primary goal was to usurp leadership within the league. Their strategy was to attack the left, win over the middle, and unite the right. They vehemently attacked Vice-Chairman Shi Liang, believed that Chairman Shen Junru should retire, and considered Vice-Chairman Gao Chongmin insignificant. Luo Longji even secretly discussed with Zeng Zhaolun how to arrange personnel within the league, encouraging Zeng to engage more in league affairs and less in outside matters. They also negotiated to use the grassroots organizations of the China Democratic League to get intellectuals in various universities into their hands. After returning to Beijing, Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun personally went to universities to conduct activities, Luo went to Renmin University, and Zhang went to the Railway Institute. Luo Longji also held many intellectual get-together seminars, inviting people with problems and many opinions. Luo even claimed to seek justice for these people. Pu Xixiu said: After the China Democratic League's National Work Conference in April, Luo Longji was very happy, saying that party members should withdraw from the league, and democratic parties could truly achieve organizational independence and political freedom from then on; the democratic parties had great prospects. Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji always felt that being Minister of Forest Industries was beneath his talents. In the early days of liberation, he wanted to be Minister of Foreign Affairs, then Minister of Justice; now, Luo Longji was wholeheartedly thinking of becoming Minister of Higher Education, believing that this would enable him to better grasp the big intellectuals.

    Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji's rightist clique became more hidden after the Zhang Dongsun incident. Luo Longji and Zeng Zhaolun had the closest relationship. Luo Longji's public speeches would all be discussed with Fei Xiaotong, Pan Guangdan, and Wu Jingchao. Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji paid special attention to the China Democratic League organizations in Shanghai and the Southwest. When I went to Shanghai in 1950, he asked me to bring letters to Peng Wenyin and Zhao Wenbi, telling them to unite and strive for electoral victory to avoid benefiting from their disunity. When I went to Shanghai in 1953 and 1954, Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, Zhao Wenbi, and Lu Yi of Luo Longji's clique all treated me to meals. They all hoped I would convey to Luo Longji that they had a lot of grievances. Some people felt that their work arrangements were inappropriate, and Lu Yi also hoped that Wenhui Daily and Xinmin Evening News would cooperate better. Luo Longji often boasted to me that arranging for Pan Dakui to work in Sichuan and arranging for me to work in the Wenhui Daily office were his most skillful achievements.

    **Luo Longji Considered Arranging for Pu Xixiu to Work at Wenhui Daily His "Proud Masterpiece"**

    Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji tried every means to get me to do the work of the Wenhui Daily office, not allowing me to study or work for other newspapers and periodicals. On April 2nd last year, Luo Longji wrote to me from Moscow, telling me that in the personnel arrangement of Wenhui Daily, "don't be too honest, you should fight for what you should fight for." Last October, when Wenhui Daily resumed publication, he said to me again: "Wenhui Daily is a newspaper with great prospects, this should be your life's work, don't complain anymore about me arranging you to work in the Wenhui Daily office." Luo Longji also instructed his confidant Liu Guanghua to come to work at the Wenhui Daily office and wanted to give Liu important responsibilities. Later, during the rectification campaign, Liu Guanghua lit fires everywhere. When Wenhui Daily resumed publication, the original idea was to focus on middle-level intellectuals while also considering big intellectuals, but Luo Longji believed that more big intellectuals should be cultivated to represent them and speak for them more. We also followed his advice. Therefore, Wenhui Daily implemented the "speaking out freely as the main focus" policy of the Zhang-Luo alliance from the very beginning of its resumption of publication. Luo Longji also told us not to listen to the party group. We told him that the party group had changed personnel, but he said: "Regardless of whether the personnel change or not, the party group is always the party group." In my work, I always asked him for advice. We had phone calls every day. He often slandered party member responsible cadres in front of me. It was because of this that I refused the introduction of party members from the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee to work in the Wenhui Daily office.

    **Luo Longji Personally Commanded Who to Organize to Write What Articles**

    Pu Xixiu said: Luo Longji also controlled the Wenhui Daily office in terms of organizing and writing articles. For example, on the issue of the scientific system, Luo told me on the phone that the "Contending" editorial department had just held a symposium on the scientific system, and you can send someone to talk to Qian Weichang. For example, on the issue of school party committees, he told us to find Fei Xiaotong; on the issue of reactionary sociology, he told us to find Li Jinghan, and so on. I also talked to him about the report on the "Peking University Democracy Wall."

    **Many People Spoke, Listing Facts and Believing That Pu Xixiu's Confession Was Not Thorough Enough**

    After Pu Xixiu's confession, Xuan Dizhi of Xinhua News Agency, Ye Gang, a reporter for Wenhui Daily, Xu Yian of Guangming Daily, and Zhu Bin of the Xinhua News Agency Beijing Branch spoke one after another. They said that it was good that Pu Xixiu was able to confess part of the situation, but they also cited many facts to show that Pu Xixiu's confession was not thorough enough, and they hoped that she would continue to confess.

    Ye Gang said: For a long time, Pu Xixiu's remarks in the Wenhui Daily office were Luo Longji's remarks. Wenhui Daily relied on the rightists of the China Democratic League and promoted the views of the rightists of the China Democratic League. Since the resumption of publication of Wenhui Daily, Pu Xixiu had wanted to absorb all the editors and reporters of the Wenhui Daily Beijing office into the China Democratic League organization. Ye Gang then cited some specific examples of Pu Xixiu's instructions to him in his interviews, explaining the situation in which Pu Xixiu promoted rightist views in specific business. Ye Gang said that the Wenhui Daily Beijing office was in the rightist network of the China Democratic League from its policy, organization to its specific business, but Pu Xixiu's confession was still evasive.

    Xu Yian of Guangming Daily revealed at the meeting that Pu Xixiu had met with Lou Bangyan, Peng Zigang, and Fei Xiaotong to discuss writing articles to refute the People's Daily's criticism of Chu Anping. He said: Pu Xixiu should confess things like this, but she did not. Xu Yian also said that Lou Bangyan had said that what Peng Zigang said at the meeting that day was completely rightist remarks.

    Zhu Bin of the Xinhua News Agency Beijing Branch exposed Pu Xixiu's attack on the state news agency. She said: In mid-May, Pu Xixiu sent two people to the Xinhua News Agency Beijing Branch to solicit articles. They repeatedly emphasized that they wanted articles that could "uncover the lid" and provoke "speaking out freely"; and said that any form would do, as long as it could play the role of "uncovering the lid." They also specifically pointed out some units and wanted us to "uncover the lid" for them.

    Xu Zhucheng continued to confess at the meeting today. He said that his exclusion of party members and opposition to the leadership of the party was consistent, but in the short 20 days after returning to Shanghai from the Soviet Union on May 14, his anti-party words and deeds developed to an extremely serious level. He said that on the third day of returning to Shanghai, he attended the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Work Conference and heard the rightist Lu Yi attacking the Communist Party members of Xinmin Evening News by name, which resonated with him ideologically. Xu Zhucheng said that he had repeatedly proposed to clarify the division of labor of the editorial board under the pretext of "the party replacing the government" at the newspaper's editorial board meeting, attempting to weaken the leadership role of Qin Benli, the party member deputy editor-in-chief, in the editorial department. Later, he rudely interfered with Qin Benli's work several times, and even proposed that Qin Benli be in charge of the second page exclusively. When the Wenhui Daily Party Group was established, Xu Zhucheng was concerned that it would hinder his arbitrary decision-making. After Chu Anping's fallacy of "the party's world" was published, Xu immediately convened the editorial board to discuss the newspaper's future practices, believing that Wenhui Daily's bourgeois orientation at that time was not enough, and even wanted to run Wenhui Daily into a so-called folk newspaper that sang against the party.

    Xu Zhucheng also revealed some of the relationship between Pu Xixiu and Luo Longji.

    After Xu Zhucheng spoke, Zou Fanyang of Xinmin Evening News, Zhu Youshi of the Journalism Department of Renmin University, Gao Ji of the People's Daily, and many others spoke one after another, raising many questions to Xu Zhucheng.

### 罗隆基怎样控制文汇报？  浦熙修开始吐露内情

    罗隆基怎样控制文汇报？
    浦熙修开始吐露内情
    据新华社10日讯　在今天继续举行的新闻工作座谈会上，浦熙修开始作了一些交代。
    为了抓大知识分子  罗隆基想当高教部长
    浦熙修说：章罗联盟是有组织有计划的。去年8月在北戴河，他们首先是想篡夺盟内的领导权，他们的策略是打击左派，争取中间，团结右派。他们对于史良副主席大肆攻击，他们认为沈钧儒主席应该退休，高崇民副主席无足轻重。罗隆基还曾和曾昭抡密议如何安排盟内人事，鼓励曾多搞盟务，少兼外面的事。他们还协商过要通过民盟基层组织把各高等学校的知识分子抓到手里。在回到北京后，罗隆基、章伯钧都亲自到大学里去活动，罗去人民大学，章去铁道学院。罗隆基还搞了许多次知识分子串连座谈会，找的都是有问题、意见多的人。罗还自称要替这些人伸冤。浦熙修说：民盟四月全国工作会议以后，罗隆基就大为高兴，说是党员要从盟内撤退，民主党派从此可以真正作到组织独立，政治自由，民主党派大有搞头了。浦熙修说：罗隆基总是认为当森林工业部长委屈了他的才能。解放初期他想当外交部长，后来又相当司法部长，现在罗隆基是一心想当高教部长，他认为这样才能更好地抓大知识分子。
    浦熙修说：罗隆基的右派小集团在张东荪事件以后，变得更加隐蔽了。罗隆基和曾昭抡的关系最密切。罗隆基的公开发言，都要请费孝通、潘光旦、吴景超三人去协商。浦熙修说：罗隆基特别注意上海和西南两地的民盟组织。1950年我到上海时，他曾托我带信给彭文应、赵文璧，要我告诉他们团结起来，争取选举胜利，以免渔人得利。1953、1954年我去上海时，罗隆基小集团的彭文应、陈仁炳、赵文璧、陆诒都请我吃过饭，他们都希望我转告罗隆基他们都有一肚子牢骚，有些人认为他们的工作安排不适当，陆诒还希望文汇报和新闻日报更好地合作。罗隆基常向我夸口把潘大逵安排在四川和把我安排在文汇报办事处是他最拿手的杰作。
    把浦熙修安排在文汇报罗隆基认为是“得意杰作”
    浦熙修说：罗隆基曾经千方百计要我搞文汇报办事处的工作，不让我去学习和作其他报刊的工作。去年4月2日罗隆基从莫斯科给我来信，叫我在文汇报的人事安排上，“不必太老实，当争的应该争”。去年10月，文汇报复刊时，他又对我说：“文汇报是一张大有搞头的报纸，这应该是你一辈子的事业了，不必再埋怨我把你安排在文汇报办事处的工作岗位上。”罗隆基又指使他的亲信刘光华到文汇报办事处来工作，并且要重用刘。以后在整风期间，刘光华就到处点火。文汇报复刊时，原来想以中层知识分子为中心，兼顾大知识分子，罗隆基认为要多搞大知识分子，代表他们，多替他们说话。我们也听从了他的意见。所以文汇报在复刊之初就贯彻了章罗联盟的“鸣放为主”的方针。罗隆基还要我们不要听党组的话。我们告诉他党组换了人，他说：“不管换人不换人，党组总是党组。”在工作中，我有事总是问他，我们每天总有电话来往。他常常在我的面前诽谤党员负责干部。正是这样，我才拒绝中宣部介绍党员来文汇报办事处工作。
    组织什么人写什么稿  罗隆基都要亲自指挥
    浦熙修说：罗隆基对于文汇报办事处的组稿写稿方面也是加以控制的。例如科学体制问题，罗就在电话中告诉我，“争鸣”编辑部刚开过科学体制座谈会，你可以派人找钱伟长谈谈。又如关于学校党委问题，他就叫我们找费孝通；关于反动社会学问题，他就叫我们找李景汉等等。关于“北大民主墙”的报道，我也和他谈起过。
    许多人发言列举事实认为浦熙修的交代还不彻底
    浦熙修交代后，新华社宣谛之、文汇报记者叶冈、光明日报徐亦安、新华社北京分社朱彬等相继发言，他们说浦熙修能够交代一部分情况是好的，但他们也举出了许多事实说明浦熙修还交代得不彻底，希望她继续交代。
    叶冈说：长期以来，浦熙修在文汇报办事处的言论就是罗隆基的言论，文汇报依靠的是民盟右派，宣传的是民盟右派的观点。文汇报复刊以来，浦熙修曾经想把文汇报北京办事处的编辑、记者全部吸收到民盟组织里去。叶冈接着举出浦熙修指挥他采访中的一些具体事例，说明浦熙修在具体业务中宣传右派观点的情形。叶冈说，文汇报北京办事处从方针、组织到具体业务都处在民盟右派罗网中，但浦熙修的交代还在遮遮掩掩。
    光明日报徐亦安在会上揭发了浦熙修约楼邦彦、彭子冈和费孝通开会，讨论写文章反驳人民日报对储安平批评的情况，他说：像这一类事情，浦熙修都应该交代，但她没有交代。徐亦安还说楼邦彦曾经讲过，彭子冈在那天会上讲的话，完全是右派言论。
    新华社北京分社的朱彬揭露了浦熙修向国家通讯社进攻的情况，她说：在5月中旬，浦熙修曾派了两个人到新华社北京分社约稿。他们再三强调要能够“揭盖子”、能够挑起“鸣放”的稿子；并且说不拘什么形式，只要能起“揭盖子”的作用就行。他们又具体指出了一些单位，要我们为他们去“揭盖子”。
    徐铸成今天在会上继续进行交代。他说他排斥党员和反对党的领导是一贯的，但在5月14日从苏联回上海后的短短二十天中，反党言行更发展到极其严重的程度。他说，回上海第三天参加上海市委宣传工作会议，听到右派分子陆诒点名攻击新闻日报的共产党员，思想上起了共鸣。徐铸成说，他曾以“以党代政”为借口，在报社编委会上，一再提出要明确编委分工，企图削弱党员副总编辑钦本立在编辑部的领导作用。以后又好几次粗暴地干涉过钦本立的工作，甚至提出要钦本立专管二版。在文汇报党组成立时，徐铸成耽心妨害他的独断专行。储安平的“党天下”谬论发表后，徐连忙召开编委会，讨论报纸今后的做法，认为当时文汇报的资产阶级方向还不够，还想把文汇报办成一张和党唱对台戏的所谓民间报纸。
    徐铸成还揭发了一些浦熙修和罗隆基的关系。
    在徐铸成发言后，新闻日报的邹凡扬、人民大学新闻系的朱友石、人民日报的高集等多人相继发言，对徐铸成提出了许多问题。
