More Concern for the Lives of Poor Peasants
Wang Zhiguo, Secretary of the CPC Xiangtan Prefectural Committee

After the realization of agricultural cooperativization in the Xiangtan area of Hunan, agricultural cooperatives have gradually become consolidated, and the living standards of the broad masses of farmers have gradually risen. This year's rural production campaign is in full swing, better than any previous year. However, we must not conclude that our work is already very good and that there are no problems with the lives of farmers. This spring, I stayed in the Gubei Cooperative in Xiangyin for five days and felt that how to improve the lives of the current poor peasants is still a big problem.

The Lives of Current Poor Peasants Are Still Difficult

Gubei Cooperative is a cooperative that has been running for a year and a half, located in a hilly area with good water conservancy conditions, and natural disasters do not pose a major threat to it. Despite the great drought last year, rice production still increased, with each labor day earning 1.15 yuan. The living standards of all cooperative members gradually improved. This year's spring plowing production is also going well, and cooperative members are stable, with no households requesting to withdraw from the cooperative. However, according to our understanding, the improvement in living standards of all farmers in the cooperative has varied over the past few years. Most have improved, but a few have not, and their lives remain difficult. The living standards of the current 215 cooperative member households can be roughly divided into five categories: The first category is relatively well-off, with 102 households, accounting for 47% of the total number of households. These people have gradually improved since liberation and now have enough to eat, live, wear, and use, with some savings. The second category can make ends meet, with basic food and clothing, but no savings. There are 62 households, accounting for 29%. The third category has insufficient food and clothing, and production and life are somewhat difficult, requiring support. There are 32 households, accounting for 15% of the total number of households. The fourth category has extreme difficulties in food, clothing, and use, and is extremely poor, with 5 households, accounting for 2.4% of the total. In addition, there are 14 five-guarantee households, who are taken care of by the agricultural cooperative, but most of them live worse than before and have great opinions, believing that the cooperative has taken advantage of them.

The problem of the aforementioned fourth category of five extremely poor households is very serious. I went to the home of one of them, named Zhang Yongchang. His entire family of six has only one laborer, himself. He was an activist during the land reform and was allocated land and houses, but he is often sick, has lost sight in one eye, and is physically weak. He fell ill again when he went to work last spring, and only recovered after transplanting seedlings, working only a hundred or so labor days throughout the year. He now has 1,500 catties of grain without money to buy, and some of the grain already distributed has been sold to pay off debts. His family's meals are not guaranteed. The whole family of six has only one tattered and black cotton quilt, with two large holes in the middle, stuffed with burlap sacks. His eldest daughter, sixteen years old, shares a bed with a neighbor's daughter. He himself, his wife, and three children share this tattered cotton quilt, with rice straw underneath. He only has one iron pot for cooking, which he borrowed from the cooperative director's house. We inquired at other cooperatives and were told that there are several households like this. If they are not given urgent aid and their difficulties are not fundamentally resolved, they will not be able to survive. The aforementioned third category of households also needs specific leadership and support; otherwise, they may not be able to make ends meet with the slightest carelessness. The difficulties of these people are mostly due to having a large family with weak labor, a thin family foundation, and being unable to manage their households well. If the lives of these people cannot improve, it will affect the consolidation of the agricultural cooperative. I believe that in today's realization of agricultural cooperativization, in the process of leading the comprehensive development of production in agricultural cooperatives, prominently caring for the lives of these people and vigorously supporting them to gradually improve is an important link in consolidating agricultural cooperatives and a concrete task in implementing class policy.

Both Resolve Their Current Difficulties and Help Them Gradually Improve

How can we help the current poor peasants gradually improve? According to the experience of various places, it must be: comprehensive arrangement, household-by-household planning, and assistance from dedicated personnel; we must pay attention to solving current living difficulties and take a long-term perspective, fundamentally helping them to gradually improve. The Dengjiafang Agricultural Cooperative is doing just that. A member of this cooperative, Chu Zhenglian, has a family of seven, with only one laborer, no quilt, and covers himself with raincoats and tattered cotton quilts. He joined the cooperative last year, worked well, and received 70% of his grain ration. This year, cooperative cadres assigned dedicated personnel to help him make a comprehensive family plan, allowing him to work in the cooperative according to a plan (how many labor days to do in the cooperative each month) and apply household fertilizer on a monthly basis; organize his wife to raise fifteen chickens and plant three points of wheat and one hundred and fifty sweet potato seedlings; and the cooperative helped him buy a ten-yuan piglet to raise (the money will be returned to the cooperative when the pig is sold). As long as he can work according to the plan, he will be able to make ends meet after this year's production.

However, at present, many rural cadres and cooperative cadres still do not understand the actual difficulties of the current poor peasants and rarely pay attention to and care for them. Some, even if they pay attention, mostly treat the symptoms rather than the root cause, not considering long-term solutions. For example, cooperative member Zhang Yongchang is having difficulty in life, and the cooperative he belongs to has already helped him three times this year. The first time the cooperative director gave him two yuan, the second time three yuan, and the third time fifty catties of grain, and there is no other way. Now he has nothing to eat again. Therefore, at present, we still need to prominently raise the issue of difficult households, requiring rural cadres and cooperative cadres to pay attention to the current living problems and future income increase problems of difficult cooperative members. The most important method is to make comprehensive and reasonable arrangements for them in agricultural work arrangement and sideline production. Relief loans should be concentrated mainly on difficult households, especially extremely poor households. Cadres should be assigned to specifically oversee how these extremely poor households live at present and how they will improve in the future, providing long-term assistance. The well-off households that have already improved should be educated to help difficult cooperative members overcome difficulties and improve together, not exclude them, and not forget their roots.

Change the Five-Guarantee Method and Improve the Living Standards of Five-Guarantee Households

Five-guarantee households are part of the current poor peasants. The implementation of the five-guarantee system after the realization of cooperativization has given these people a reliance, so the five-guarantee households support the policies of the Party and the government. However, due to the initial establishment of cooperatives, the cooperative's public welfare fund is limited, and the five-guarantee method is not yet perfect, so the lives of five-guarantee households are not very stable. At a farmers' symposium we held in Gubei Cooperative this time, a five-guarantee household named Zhang Ziqing raised an opinion to us, saying, "The People's Government stipulates the five guarantees so that our lonely and widowed households have something to rely on and live a better life, but now life is not as good as it used to be." What is the reason for this? After investigation and research, the reason is this: Gubei Cooperative has a total of 14 five-guarantee households, with 15 people, of whom 13 are unable to work. During the land reform, each person was allocated an average of 2.9 mu of land, yielding 1,280 catties of production. These fields are generally near the village and of good quality. In the past, six households relied on relatives, two households relied on friends, and six households hired people to cultivate these fields, paying little labor themselves. The public grain that should be handed over each year was also reduced or exempted by 60%. The state also provided relief funds of about 140 yuan per year to the 14 households. In this way, their lives before the five guarantees were generally very good. After the five guarantees, each person only received a basic grain ration of 450 catties, 150 catties of sweet potatoes, 2,000 catties of straw (fuel), and one catty of oil. The state relief fund for the 14 households was only 33 yuan, with an average living standard of only 32 yuan per person per year. For example, Zhang Ziqing, 72 years old, had two and a half mu of land. In the past, he hired people to cultivate it and could harvest more than 1,200 catties of grain, netting 600 to 700 catties of grain after deducting labor costs. In addition, he could also harvest 300 to 400 catties of sweet potatoes and enjoy 15 yuan in state relief funds, living a very good life. Compared with before the five guarantees, the current life is of course very different. He now wants to withdraw from the cooperative and have someone else cultivate the fields for him.

From here, we realize that there are indeed problems in the implementation of the five-guarantee policy. Only a small number of cooperatives have done the five guarantees perfectly, and most cooperatives have not fully settled the five-guarantee households. The cooperative's economic conditions are limited, and the public welfare fund cannot temporarily solve all the problems of the five-guarantee households, making the cooperative cadres very embarrassed. Some cooperatives, although they have arranged and taken good care of the five-guarantee households, members also have opinions about too much care. In order to solve this problem, we discussed with cooperative cadres and considered changing the form of the five guarantees, turning the fields of the five-guarantee households into five-guarantee public welfare fields within the cooperative, which would be uniformly cultivated by the cooperative, and the income would be specifically used to solve the living problems of the five-guarantee households. In terms of method, labor and costs can be calculated separately for each household. Each year, the income is calculated according to the social labor price, deducting wages, cattle rent, seeds, fertilizers, and the actual public grain handed over after production reduction, and the rest is given to the five-guarantee households in full (this is actually equivalent to the cooperative contracting the cultivation). The fields of the five-guarantee households can also be kept as a separate account, which can be collectively distributed by the five-guarantee households. According to the results of doing this, it is calculated that the living standards of the five-guarantee households in Gubei Cooperative this year can be increased from 32 yuan last year to 42 yuan. The five-guarantee households will get more real benefits, and they will also be distributed the fruits grown on their original land, and they will have a long-term reliance, so they will naturally be more satisfied. Other cooperative members who cultivate the fields for the five-guarantee households, after deducting wages, etc., will also feel that they are not completely raising the five-guarantee households for nothing. I think this method can be tried.

    更多地关心贫农生活
    中共湘潭地委书记　王治国
    湖南湘潭地区实现了农业合作化以后，农业社逐渐趋于巩固，广大农民的生活水平亦逐渐上升。今年农村生产运动搞得热火朝天，比过去任何一年都好。但绝不能就此认为我们工作已经很好了，农民生活一点问题也没有了。今年春末我到湘阴古培社住了五天，感觉到如何使现贫农的生活有所改善，还是一个很大的问题。
    现贫农的生活还很困难
    古培社是个办了一年半的社，处在丘陵地区，水利条件好，自然灾害对它威胁不大，去年那样的大旱，稻谷仍然增产了，每个劳动日分一元一角五分，全社农民生活逐步上升。今年春耕生产也搞得不坏，社员情绪稳定，没有一户要求退社的，但据我们了解，全社的农户中，几年来生活上升的情况是不同的，多数的上升，少数的没有上升，生活仍很困难。现在二百一十五户社员的生活水平大体可分五类：第一类是较富裕的，有一百零二户、占全社户数47％。这些人解放以来逐步上升，现在有吃、有住、有穿、有用，多少还有点积余。第二类生活过得去，吃穿基本够用，但没有积余。共六十二户，占29％。第三类吃、穿不大足，生产、生活都有些困难，需要支持。共有三十二户，占总户数15％。第四类吃、穿、用极端困难，赤贫如洗，共五户，占总户2.4％。此外有十四户五保户，他们虽由农业社包起来了，但大都生活不如以前，意见很大，认为合作社占了他们的便宜。
    上述第四类五户的极贫户，问题非常严重。我到了其中一户叫张永昌的家里。他全家六口人仅他一人劳动。土地改革时是积极分子，分得了田地、房屋，但他经常生病，瞎了一只眼睛，体力不强。去年春天出工时又病倒了，到插秧后才好，全年只作百多个劳动日。现在有一千五百斤口粮没钱买，已分回的也出卖一部分还账了，生活上餐不接下餐。全家六口人，只一床又烂又黑的破棉絮，中间两个大窟窿，用麻袋塞住。大女孩十六岁，和邻居女孩搭铺。他自己和妻子及三个小孩合盖着这条破棉絮，下面垫的是稻草。他做饭只一个铁锅，还是从社长家中借来的。我们打听了其他合作社，据说像这样的户都有几户。对他们如不急救，并且从根本上帮助解决困难，是无法生存下去的。上述第三类户，也必须有具体的领导和支持，不然，稍一不得法也会过不去。这些人的困难大都是由于人多劳力弱，家底薄又不会理家等因素形成的。这些人的生活不能上升，就会影响农业社的巩固。我认为在实现了农业合作化的今天，在领导农业社全面发展生产的过程中，突出的关心这些人的生活，大力加以扶持，使他们逐步上升，是我们巩固农业社的一个重要环节，也是贯彻阶级政策的具体工作。
    既要解决他们当前困难又要帮助他们逐步上升
    如何帮助现贫农逐步上升呢？根据各地经验，必须是：全面安排，逐户规划，专人帮助；既要注意解决当前生活困难，又要从长远着眼，从根本上帮助他们逐步上升。有个邓家坊农业社就是这样做的。这个社的社员楚正连，全家七口人，一个人劳动，没有被子，盖蓑衣和破棉絮。去年入社，劳动好，拿回了70％的口粮。今年社干部指定专人帮他作出了全面的家庭计划，让他有计划地分月出工（每月社内做多少劳动日），分月投家肥；组织他妻子养鸡十五只，并种了三分小麦，一百五十蔸洋芋；社内帮他买了只十元的小猪养着（卖了猪还钱给社内）。只要他能按计划出工，今年生产下来即可过得去了。
    但目前也有不少的农村干部和社干部，还不了解现贫农的实际困难，很少注意和关心他们。有的虽然注意了，又多是头痛医头、脚痛医脚，不从长期解决问题着想。如社员张永昌的生活困难，他所在的社今年已经帮助了他三次，第一次社长支给二元，第二次三元，第三次五十斤谷，此外别无他法，现在他又没有吃的了。因此，目前我们还需要突出地提出困难户的问题，要求农村干部和社干部注意困难社员的当前生活问题和今后增加收入问题。最主要的办法，是在农业排工当中和副业生产当中，对他们加以全面的合理的安排。救济贷款应集中主要部分用在困难户身上，特别是赤贫如洗的困难户身上。这些赤贫户当前如何生活，以后如何上升，要指定干部专门掌握，长期帮助。对于已上升的富裕户，应教育他们帮助困难社员共同克服困难，共同上升，不要排斥他们，不要忘本。
    改变五保办法，提高五保户生活水平
    五保户是现贫农的一部分。合作化实现以后实行五保，使这些人有了依靠，因此五保户对党和政府的政策是拥护的。但由于合作社初办，社的公益金有限，五保的办法还不完善，因而使五保户生活还不很稳定。我们这次在古培社的一个农民座谈会上，有个五保户叫张自清的，向我们提出了意见，说：“人民政府规定五保，是要我们孤寡户生活有所依靠，日子过得更好，但现在生活不如过去好。”这是什么原因呢？经过调查研究，其原因是这样：古培社共十四户五保户，十五口人，其中十三人不能劳动。土改时，每人平均分有二点九亩田，一千二百八十斤产量，这些田一般是近田好田。过去这些田的耕种，有六户靠亲戚，二户靠朋友，六户请人种，自己付出的劳动代价不多。每年应交的公粮又减免了60％。十四户人家每年国家还要救济一百四十元左右。这样，他们在五保前的生活一般是过得很好的。五保后他们每人只分得基本口粮四百五十斤，甘薯一百五十斤，稻草二千斤（燃料），油一斤，国家救济十四户共三十三元，每人一年平均生活水平只三十二元。如七十二岁的张自清，二亩半田，过去请人耕种，能收一千二百多斤谷子，除去工本费净得六、七百斤粮食。另外还能收到三、四百斤甘薯，享有国家救济款十五元，生活过得很好。五保后的生活与以前比较，当然相差很远。他现在想退社，将田请人代耕。
    从这里，我们想到在执行五保政策上确实是有问题的。五保作得完全好的社是少数的，大部分社对五保户全面安置不够。社的经济条件有限，公益金暂时还不能解决五保户的全部问题，社干很为难。有的社虽然对五保户安排照顾得好，但社员对照顾过多也有意见。为了解决这个问题，我们同社干部商量，考虑在五保的形式上予以改变，将五保户的田作为社内的五保公益田，由社内统一耕种，其收入专门解决五保户的生活问题。在方法上可以分户计算人工、成本。每年收入按社会劳动工价扣除工资、耕牛租金、种子、肥料和减产后实交的公粮，其余部分全部给五保户
  （这实际等于由社内包耕）。也可以把五保户的田单独立账，由五保户集体分配。照这样作的结果，计算起来，古培社五保户的生活水平，今年可由去年的三十二元提高到四十二元，五保户得到较多的实惠，又是分得原来自己土地上生长的果实，而且长期有了靠头，他们自然会比较满意了。其他社员给五保户作田，扣回了工资等等，也会感到并不是完全白养五保户了。我认为这办法可以试行。
