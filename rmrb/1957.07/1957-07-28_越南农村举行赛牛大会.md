    In April, Shou Xuan County in Qinghua Province, Vietnam, held a buffalo race to select the best-raised buffaloes. The twenty-eight buffaloes that participated in the competition were selected from 15,672 bulls and cows over three years old in the entire county through four levels of preliminary rounds: village, township, area, and district. As a result of the evaluation, the buffaloes of Du Shi Mian, an old farmer woman from Chun Bai Township, and He Ru Feng, an old farmer woman from Shou Jin Township, won the first prize for bulls and cows respectively.
    Du Shi Mian's bull is eight years old this year and is strong and well-built. It is 1.16 meters tall and 1.34 meters long. This bull has mated with cows 71 times, and each time the cow gave birth to a calf. He Ru Feng's cow is thirteen years old, 1.03 meters tall, and 1.17 meters long. It has continuously given birth to eleven calves in the past eleven years. To reward the two old ladies for their careful care of the cattle, the government awarded them each 30,000 yuan (Vietnamese currency). (Photo attached)

    清化省寿春县4月间举行了赛牛大会，评选哪一户的牛饲养的最好。参加比赛的二十八头牛，是经过村、乡、片、区等四级预赛，从全县一万五千六百七十二头三岁以上的牡牛和牝牛中挑选出来的。评选结果，寿春县春拜乡农民杜氏棉老太太和寿进乡何如奉老太太的牛，分别获得了牡牛和牝牛的第一奖。
    杜氏棉老太太的牡牛今年八岁，长的膘肥筋壮。身高一点一六公尺，身长一点三四公尺。这头牛七十一次同牝牛交配，每次牝牛都生了小牛。何如奉老太太的牝牛十三岁，身高一点○三公尺，长一点一七公尺，最近十一年来，连续生了十一头小牛。为了奖励两位老太太对牛的悉心照管，政府发给她们每人三万元（越南币）奖金。（附图片）
