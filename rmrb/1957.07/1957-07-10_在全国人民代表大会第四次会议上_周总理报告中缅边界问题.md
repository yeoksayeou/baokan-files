Xinhua News Agency, July 9th. Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai delivered a "Report on the Sino-Burmese Border Issue" this afternoon at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: "After numerous contacts and discussions between the governments of China and Burma, based on the spirit of friendship and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, they have reached a consensus on the overall aspects. We believe that, through continued consultation and coordination of the views of both sides on specific issues, the Sino-Burmese border issue will be resolved comprehensively, fairly, and reasonably."

In this special report, Premier Zhou Enlai described the process by which our government has handled the Sino-Burmese border issue so far, and explained the basic policy that our government has followed in handling the Sino-Burmese border issue.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the consistent policy of our country in international affairs since its founding has been to strive for the easing of the world situation and to strive for peaceful coexistence with all countries in the world, especially with our neighboring countries. The basic policy of peaceful diplomacy is also the basis for our government's handling of the Sino-Burmese border issue. He pointed out that the position taken by our government in resolving the Sino-Burmese border issue is based on safeguarding our national interests, and at the same time promoting Sino-Burmese friendship and the unity of Asian and African countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai explained the complex historical background of the Sino-Burmese border issue, and pointed out how historical data should be correctly used to seek a fair and reasonable solution to the Sino-Burmese border issue.

Premier Zhou Enlai also pointed out that the Sino-Burmese border issue is directly related to the interests of various ethnic groups living along the Sino-Burmese border. In view of this situation, we need even more to consult with the Burmese government to take measures to make the future demarcated border a border of peace and friendship, and to further develop the close ties between the border people of the two countries.

At the end of Premier Zhou Enlai's report, the entire audience applauded warmly for a long time.

Following that, the meeting continued with the general discussion. Today, eight representatives spoke at the meeting, including Li Dequan and Da Punsheng.

Minister of Health Li Dequan, in her speech, refuted the fallacy of rightists who slandered the leadership of the Communist Party as a "Party-dominated world." She said that the hearts of the Chinese people are linked with the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Since the beginning of history, no political party has united the broadest masses of the people like the Communist Party, correctly pointed out the goals of their struggle, and no members of any party have had such a high degree of class consciousness, selflessness, self-sacrifice, and wholehearted service to the people as the Communist Party members. It is our infinite glory and happiness, and also the unprecedented glory and happiness of the Chinese people since the beginning of history, to have the leadership of such a glorious and great Communist Party and such a wise leader as Chairman Mao.

Li Dequan said that in this rectification movement, the people of the whole country, especially the workers and peasants, showed their infinite loyalty and love for the Party. Only a very small number of ambitious careerists with ulterior motives exposed their true colors and were spurned by the broad masses of the people. Li Dequan warned the rightists that they should wake up in time, pull back from the brink, and return to the shore, and not cut themselves off from the people.

Da Punsheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association, expressed his full support for the establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In his speech, he said that the Hui people were overjoyed and spread the news to each other after hearing this news, celebrating this great event for the Hui nationality. He said that there are more than 3.5 million Hui people in the country, most of whom live in various parts of the country due to historical reasons. It is very appropriate to choose Ningxia and its surrounding areas in Gansu Province, where there is a large Hui population, to establish a Hui autonomous region. This region includes seventeen counties and two cities, covering an area of more than 77,800 square kilometers, with a population of more than 1.7 million, and is rich in products and minerals. The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway will pass through the region. This is a region with great development prospects. He said that we must build the autonomous region well. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the help of all ethnic brothers and sisters in the country, especially the Han brothers, we will definitely develop our political, economic, cultural and other aspects of construction, and gradually become an advanced socialist nation. In order to build the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region well, he particularly emphasized three things: the Hui people must unite well internally, they must unite well with all ethnic groups, and they must rely closely on the leadership of the Communist Party.

Dong Qiwu, General of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Wang Tao, Engineer of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, Liu Shenge, Deputy Director of the Shenyang Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yu Hongzheng, Director of the Northwest Institute of Agricultural Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yang Shixian, President of Nankai University, and Guan Baojia, Governor of the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazak Autonomous Prefecture, delivered written speeches today. Dong Qiwu refuted the anti-socialist remarks of the rightists in all aspects. He expressed his determination to study hard, raise his awareness, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland. Wang Tao put forward suggestions on the further development of my country's cement industry. In a joint written speech, Liu Shenge and Yu Hongzheng put forward criticisms and suggestions on strengthening the development of animal husbandry, aquaculture, and production in mountainous areas, unifying the leadership of the forest logging industry and forest management departments, improving the rational logging methods of forests, and soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Yang Shixian spoke about the achievements of higher education and put forward suggestions on improving higher education work in the future. Guan Baojia introduced the remarkable changes and developments in various aspects such as politics, economy, culture, and education in the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan-Kazak Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province in recent years.

Today's executive chairmen of the congress were: Peng Zhen, Shao Lizi, Gao Chongmin, Liao Chengzhi, Zhu Dehai, Zhou Xinfang, Gong Tianmin, and Meng Tai.

Today's afternoon meeting started at 3:00 PM and ended at 7:00 PM.

    在全国人民代表大会第四次会议上
    周总理报告中缅边界问题
    他说：通过继续协商，中缅边界问题就将得到全面的和公平合理的解决。
    新华社9日讯　国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来今天下午在第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议上作了“关于中缅边界问题的报告”。
    周恩来总理说：“中缅两国政府根据友好的精神和和平共处的五项原则，对中缅边界问题进行了多次的接触和商谈以后，已经在总的方面取得一致意见。我们相信，通过继续的协商，把双方在具体问题上的意见加以协调以后，中缅边界问题就将得到全面的和公平合理的解决。”
    周恩来总理在这个专门报告中，叙述了我国政府到目前为止处理中缅边界问题的经过，说明了我国政府在处理中缅边界问题中所遵循的基本政策。
    周恩来总理说，我们的国家自从开国以来在国际事务中一贯奉行的政策，就是争取世界局势的和缓，争取同世界各国、特别是同我们的邻国，和平共处。我国政府在处理中缅边界问题时所根据的，也正是这个基本的和平外交政策。他指出，我国政府在解决中缅边界问题上所采取的立场，是从维护我国的民族利益出发的，同时也是从促进中缅友谊和亚非各国团结的利益出发的。
    周恩来总理说明中缅边界问题的复杂的历史背景，指出应该怎样正确地运用历史资料来求得中缅边界问题的公平合理的解决。
    周恩来总理并且指出，中缅边界问题直接地关系到聚居在中缅边境的各民族的利益。鉴于这种情况，我们就更加需要同缅甸政府协商采取措施，使将来划定的边界成为和平友好的边界，进一步发展两国边民之间的亲密联系。
    周恩来总理报告结束时，全场长时间地热烈鼓掌。
    接着，会议继续进行大会讨论。今天在大会上发言的代表有李德全、达浦生等八人。
    卫生部部长李德全在发言中驳斥了右派分子污蔑共产党的领导是
  “党天下”的谬论。她说，中国人民的心是和共产党和毛主席联在一起的。自有史以来，没有任何政党像共产党这样团结了最广大的人民，为他们正确地指出奋斗的目标，也没有任何党派的成员像共产党员那样具有高度的阶级觉悟，大公无私，自我牺牲，全心全意为人民服务的精神。中国人民有这样光荣伟大的共产党的领导，有这样英明的领袖毛主席，这是我们无限的光荣和幸福，也是中国人民有史以来没有的光荣和幸福。
    李德全说，在这次整风运动中，全国人民首先是工人和农民表现出对党的无限忠诚和热爱，只有极少数别有用心的野心家暴露了他们的原形而为广大人民所唾弃。李德全警告右派分子，应该及时猛醒，悬崖勒马，回头是岸，不要自绝于人民。
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生表示完全拥护成立宁夏回族自治区和广西僮族自治区。他在发言中说，回族人民听到这个消息以后，都欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，庆贺这件回回民族的大喜事。他说，全国回族人民共有三百五十多万，由于历史原因，大部分居住在全国各地。现在选择甘肃境内回族人口较多的宁夏及其附近地区建立回族自治区，是十分适当的。这个地区包括十七个县和两个市，面积有七万七千八百多平方公里，人口有一百七十多万，物产丰富，矿藏很多，包兰铁路将穿越过境。这是很有发展前途的地区。他说，我们一定要将自治区建设好。我们一定能在共产党领导下，在全国各族兄弟，特别是汉族兄弟的帮助下，发展我们的政治、经济、文化等各方面建设，逐步地成为先进的社会主义民族。要建设好宁夏回族自治区，他特别强调了三件事：回族内部一定要很好团结，要和各族人民很好团结，要紧紧依靠共产党的领导。
    中国人民解放军董其武将军、建筑材料工业部工程师王涛、中国科学院沈阳林业土壤研究所副所长刘慎谔和中国科学院西北农业生物研究所所长虞宏正、南开大学校长杨石先、海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州州长官保加，今天作了书面发言。董其武从各方面驳斥了右派分子反社会主义的言论。他表示要努力学习，提高觉悟，来保卫祖国的社会主义建设。王涛就进一步发展我国水泥工业问题，提出了建议。刘慎谔、虞宏正在书面联合发言中，对加强发展畜牧业、水产业以及山区各业生产、统一森林采伐工业部门和森林经营部门的领导、改进森林的合理采伐方式，以及黄河中游的水土保持工作，提出了批评和建议。杨石先讲了高等教育的成就，并对今后改进高等教育工作问题提出了建议。官保加介绍了青海省海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州几年来在政治、经济、文化教育等各方面的显著变化和发展。
    今天大会执行主席是：彭真、邵力子、高崇民、廖承志、朱德海、周信芳、巩天民、孟泰。
    今天下午的会议从三时开始，到七时结束。
