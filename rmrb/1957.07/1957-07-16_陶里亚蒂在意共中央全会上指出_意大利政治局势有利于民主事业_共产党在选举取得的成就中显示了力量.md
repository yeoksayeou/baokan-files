Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 15th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party held a plenary session from July 11th to 13th. The meeting heard a report from the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Togliatti, on the results of the recent Italian municipal elections and on the political situation.

　　Togliatti began by talking about the domestic political situation. He emphasized that the most important event in recent months has been the disruption of the political balance based on the alliance between the Christian Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Republican Party. This is because it does not meet the requirements of national life, and because it is only used to mask conservative and reactionary changes. Togliatti pointed out that this development is an important positive factor for the democratic cause in Italy.

　　Togliatti said that after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, our enemies desperately tried to create the impression in broad public opinion that communism was encountering a crisis, in an attempt to split the ranks of the working class and maintain their reactionary rule. However, this conspiracy has gone bankrupt. The recent elections held in many provincial capitals and other cities in the mainland of our country prove that our party not only retains its political strength, but also shows that it is capable of expanding its base among voters. The achievements we have made in the elections are a heavy blow to all those who preach about the crisis of communism. Togliatti then pointed out that there are still some extremely disturbing factors in the current political situation, and pointed out that the attacks of large entrepreneurs and landlords are also increasing. He said that the Christian Democrats openly want to strive for a complete monopoly on the political leadership of the country. The ruling class is attempting to attack the republican constitution in order to prevent any reforms to the country's economic and political structure, and to strengthen the enslavement of Italy by imperialist powers.

　　Togliatti spoke about the relationship with the Socialist Party. He said that the attempt by the Social Democratic Party and the Socialist Party to carry out a merger detrimental to the Communist Party behind the back of the Communist Party not only fails to create any opportunity for a democratic choice in the face of the threat of clerical attacks, but eliminates any such possibility. This cannot but cause a crisis among the Socialist Party's voters, and cannot but cause a crisis within the Socialist Party itself.

　　Togliatti said: Only cooperation and mutual understanding between all forces that rely on the working masses and are committed to democracy and socialism can be a serious, realistic, and practically effective choice.

　　Togliatti emphasized that the party is following the path prescribed by the Eighth Congress. We have had a series of contacts with communist parties in other countries. Thanks to these meetings and all our activities, we have made a positive contribution to the implementation of the guidelines of the 20th Congress, especially in the struggle against revisionism, formalism, and opportunism that have appeared in our ranks since the 20th Congress.

　　Referring to the resolution of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, Togliatti said that the Italian communists expressed their full support for the CPSU Central Committee. The plenary session of the Central Committee unanimously adopted Togliatti's report. The plenary session also unanimously adopted a resolution on accepting the Trieste Communist Party organization as an autonomous provincial committee of the Italian Communist Party.

    陶里亚蒂在意共中央全会上指出
    意大利政治局势有利于民主事业
    共产党在选举取得的成就中显示了力量
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社罗马14日讯：意大利共产党中央委员会7月11日到13日举行了全体会议。会议听取了共产党总书记陶里亚蒂关于不久以前意大利市政选举的结果和关于政治形势的报告。
    陶里亚蒂一开始先谈到国内的政治情况。他强调说，最近几个月来最重要的事件是以天主教民主党同自由党、社会民主党和共和党的联盟为基础的政治均势受到了破坏。这是因为它不符合国家生活的要求，因为它仅仅被用来掩饰保守和反动的变革。陶里亚蒂指出，这一发展对意大利的民主事业是重要的积极因素。
    陶里亚蒂说，在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后，我们的敌人拚命在广泛的舆论中造成共产主义遭遇危机的印象，企图用这种办法来分裂工人阶级队伍，保持他们的反动统治。但是，这种阴谋已经破产了。最近在许多省会和我国大陆部分的其他城市举行的选举，证明我们党不仅保有自己的政治力量，而且表明它是有能力在选民中扩大自己的基础的。我们在选举中获得的成绩是对一切宣扬共产主义危机的人的沉重打击。陶里亚蒂接着指出了在目前的政治局势下还存在着一些使人极其不安的因素，指出了大企业家和地主的进攻也在日益加强。他说，天主教民主党人公开想争取完全垄断国家的政治领导。统治阶级企图打击共和国宪法，以阻挠对国家的经济和政治结构实行任何改革，并且加强帝国主义强国对意大利的奴役。
    陶里亚蒂讲到了和社会党的关系。他说，社会民主党和社会党想背着共产党实行不利于共产党的合并，这种企图不仅不能在教权派进攻的威胁面前开创任何民主选择的机会，反而消除了任何这种可能。这不能不在社会党的选民中引起了危机，而且也不能不部分地在社会党内引起了危机。
    陶里亚蒂说：只有一切依靠劳动群众和致力于民主与社会主义的力量实行合作，相互谅解，才可能是一个认真、现实而实际有效的选择。
    陶里亚蒂强调说，党走着第八次代表大会所规定的道路。我们曾与其它国家的共产党有过一系列的接触。由于这些晤谈和我们的一切活动，我们在实现二十次代表大会的方针方面，特别是在对二十次代表大会以后我们队伍中出现的修正主义、公式主义和机会主义作斗争方面，做出了积极的贡献。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到苏共中央六月全会的决议时说，意大利共产党员对于苏共中央表示完全拥护。中央委员会全体会议一致通过了陶里亚蒂的报告。全体会议还一致通过了关于接受的里雅斯特共产党组织为意大利共产党的一个自治省委会的决议案。
