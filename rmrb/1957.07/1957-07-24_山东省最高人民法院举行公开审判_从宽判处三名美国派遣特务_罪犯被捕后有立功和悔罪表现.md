(Reported by our newspaper from Jinan, July 23rd) The Shandong Provincial Higher People's Court publicly tried the U.S.-sent special agent counter-revolutionary case at Pearl Spring in Jinan on July 23rd, a case that the people of the whole country have been concerned about, involving two groups captured last year in Haiyang County, Shandong Province. Special agent Li Tianqing was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, Yuan Amu to five years of imprisonment, and Ren Longren (Korean) to seven years of imprisonment.

These two groups of special agents, originally under the Tokyo spy organization of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, landed by sea on May 10th and June 6th last year, respectively. The first group of special agents, Li Tianqing (leader), Yuan Amu, and Wu Bojun, who committed suicide by taking poison at the time of capture, received special agent training from the U.S. spy agency. Under the specific command of U.S. spy officer Captain Raymond (transliteration), they attempted to land in Northeast China and Shandong Province five times between December 1955 and March 1956, failing each time until the sixth attempt, when they landed at Dongjiazhuang, Haiyang County. However, less than twelve hours after landing, they were discovered by three local young women, Xin Qingyun and others, and were quickly captured by our garrison troops, public security organs, and militia.

The second group of special agents, Ren Longren, Zheng Yunhai (who drowned), and Cui Changzhen (Korean, who was shot dead on the spot), landed at Dongjiazhuang in an attempt to pick up Li Tianqing and the others, but were besieged and captured by our garrison troops and public security organs. From the beginning of 1953 to June 1955, Ren Longren had successively transported six groups of special agents to Longyanpu, Wengjin, Changshanchuan, and Hanchuan in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. After July 1955, he transported four groups of special agents to Northeast China and Shandong Province. This time, he received the punishment he deserved from the people of our country.

After the procurator read the indictment, the judges questioned the special agent Li Tianqing and others one by one based on the indictment. Under the angry gazes of more than 1,600 attending citizens, especially in the face of the ironclad evidence exhibited in court, such as confiscated coastal communication devices, triangular mirrors, infrared flashlights, pistols, daggers, and forged demobilized soldier certificates, they lowered their heads and admitted to all their counter-revolutionary facts, including attempting to gather information on the radar locations and troop deployments of our army, as well as collecting a large number of our work permits, membership cards, and other various documents and personal belongings, in order to prepare for the large-scale dispatch of special agents in the future.

After the procurator and defense lawyers debated the facts of the special agents Li Tianqing and others betraying the motherland and endangering national security, the judges announced the verdicts. They pointed out that Li Tianqing had shown merit after being arrested. Therefore, in accordance with the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, and atonement for merit," he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Yuan Amu did not resist arrest and showed signs of confessing and repenting, so he was also given a lenient sentence of five years of imprisonment. Ren Longren was loyal to the U.S. spy agency and repeatedly sailed ships to illegally cross the border, so he was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. All the counter-revolutionary equipment and activity funds of the criminals Li Tianqing and others were confiscated.

    山东省最高人民法院举行公开审判
    从宽判处三名美国派遣特务
    罪犯被捕后有立功和悔罪表现
    本报济南23日电　全国人民关心的去年从山东海阳县捕获的两批美国派遣特务反革命案，山东省最高人民法院已于23日在济南珍珠泉公开审判。特务分子李天庆被判处有期徒刑一年，袁阿木被判处有期徒刑五年，任龙仁（朝鲜人）被判处有期徒刑七年。
    这两批美国中央情报局原属东京间谍机关的派遣特务，是在去年5月10日和6月6日分别由海上登陆的。第一批特务分子李天庆（组长）、袁阿木及就捕时畏罪服毒自杀的吴伯钧，接受了美国间谍机关特务训练，在美国间谍分子雷蒙（译音）上尉具体指挥下，于1955年12月至1956年3月间，曾五次企图在我国东北和山东登陆未逞，第六次始在海阳县董家庄登陆，但登陆后不到十二小时，即为当地青年妇女辛清云等三人发现，被我驻军与公安机关、民兵迅速捕获。
    第二批特务分子任龙仁和郑允海（已淹死）、崔昌镇（朝鲜人，已当场击毙）在董家庄登陆，企图将李天庆等三人接回去，结果遇到我驻军和公安机关围剿捕获。任龙仁自1953年初至1955年6月，曾先后向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国龙岩浦、瓮津、长山川、汉川等地输送六批特务分子，1955年7月以后，向我国东北、山东地区输送过四批特务，这一次才受到我国人民的应有惩罚。
    当检察长宣读了起诉书后，审判员根据起诉书一一发问，特务分子李天庆等在一千六百多名旁听公民的怒视下，特别是在当庭展览了缴获的海岸联络器、三角镜、红外线手电筒、手枪、匕首、伪造复员军人证等铁证面前，低着头承认了他们全部反革命事实，及企图搜集我军雷达部位、部队分布情况，及大量搜集我工作证、会员证等各种证件和自用物品，以便为今后大量派遣特务做好准备等罪行。
    经过检察长和辩护律师辩论了特务分子李天庆等背叛祖国、危害国家安全等反革命罪行的事实后，审判员宣布判决，他指出：李天庆在被捕后有立功表现，故根据“坦白从宽、抗拒从严、立功折罪”的政策，判处有期徒刑一年；袁阿木在被捕时无拒捕行为，并有认罪悔改之意，亦予从轻判处，判有期徒刑五年；任龙仁效忠美国间谍机关，多次驾驶船只偷越国境，判处有期徒刑七年。罪犯李天庆等的一切反革命用具和活动经费，全部没收。
