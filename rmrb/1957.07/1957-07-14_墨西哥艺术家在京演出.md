Xinhua News Agency, July 12th:
	Famous Mexican folk ballet dancers, Joséfina Lavalle and Oscar Bringas, gave their premiere performance at the People's Theater tonight. The Salvador Three Brothers Chorus also performed.
	Lavalle, who has fifteen years of dance experience, is the director and founder of the Mexican Folk Ballet Dance Troupe, one of the three ballet dance troupes in all of Mexico. This dance troupe was established in 1948 and enjoys a great reputation in the country. Many of the nine dances performed by Lavalle tonight were adapted from the forms and content of local ethnic dances in her country. They are full of the flavor of life, enthusiastic and unrestrained, yet subtle and profound.
	The Salvador Three Brothers, dressed in Mexican national costumes, sang leaning on each other, holding guitars and mandolins. They sang fourteen songs, but added more songs at the enthusiastic applause of the audience.

    墨西哥艺术家在京演出
    据新华社12日讯　著名墨西哥民间芭蕾舞蹈家何塞费纳·拉瓦丽叶和奥斯加尔·布恩特今晚在人民剧场举行首次公演。萨尔瓦多三兄弟合唱团也同时演出。
    具有十五年舞蹈历史的拉瓦丽叶是全墨西哥三个芭蕾舞蹈团之一的墨西哥民间芭蕾舞蹈团团长兼创办人。这个舞蹈团于1948年成立，在国内享有很大声誉。拉瓦丽叶今天晚上表演的九个舞蹈中有很多是吸收了本国各地方民族舞蹈的形式和内容而改编的，生活气息浓厚，热情豪放，而又含蓄深刻。
    萨尔瓦多三兄弟穿着墨西哥民族服装，手抱吉他和曼陀林，相倚而歌。他们唱了十四个歌，但在观众热烈鼓掌下又加唱了歌。
