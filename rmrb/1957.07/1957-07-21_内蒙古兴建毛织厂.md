Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 19th: A modern woolen mill is under construction in Hohhot. According to the established project schedule, this factory will be put into production in the first quarter of next year.

This is a woolen mill with a considerable production capacity, capable of processing more than 6.2 million kilograms of wool and cashmere annually. It will produce large quantities of yarn and plush for winter clothing for people across the country. Yarn, one of its main products, will have an annual output sufficient for 2.18 million people to make a sweater each.

Except for the wool selection process, the factory's combing, carding, scouring, dyeing, spinning, and finishing processes are all mechanized.

The factory will be expanded year by year in the future. After the expansion, various wool fabrics, blankets, and serge can also be woven.
