In his speech, Yu Yanong said that Anhui Province encountered very serious natural disasters last year, but the lives of the majority of farmers were still able to improve: the average rural population of the province possessed 655 jin of grain per person, an increase of 38 jin compared to 1955; the sales volume of daily necessities also increased significantly.

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and fully agree with the work reports made by Vice Premiers Li and Bo, Prosecutor-General Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng. We believe that the central government's policies adopted in 1956 were completely correct. This is not only proven by the great achievements made in the nationwide socialist transformation and socialist construction, but also fully and concretely demonstrated by the various achievements made in Anhui Province over the past year in implementing the central government's policies. Now, I would like to express some opinions on the rural work situation in Anhui Province over the past year.

In 1956, Anhui Province achieved agricultural collectivization. A total of 6.8 million peasant households joined cooperatives, accounting for 98.13% of the total number of households in the province. Among them, the number of households joining advanced cooperatives accounted for 94.84% of the total number of households. This fundamentally changed the relations of production in the rural areas of our province, enabling millions of farmers to embark on the road of socialism, thereby eliminating the danger of the small-peasant economy polarizing and avoiding the suffering of taking the capitalist road.

In the first year of realizing collectivization in our province, we encountered very serious natural disasters. Last year's summer harvest crops suffered a severe drought with no significant rainfall for five months. Wheat generally developed diseases, and some areas were flooded. Autumn crops were hit by nine heavy rainstorms and one strong typhoon, and the total sown area affected by flooding reached more than 80 million mu, accounting for about 50% of the total sown area. In the struggle against natural disasters, agricultural production cooperatives demonstrated their tremendous superiority and brought into play the collective strength in fighting disasters. Under the slogans of "competing with water for land" and "competing with water for grain," the broad masses of cooperative members actively went into the water to rush the harvest, support seedlings, drain water, and replant. Several million mu of land were replanted four or five times. The hardship of the struggle can be imagined. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives in various places extensively promoted agricultural production reforms. Double-cropping rice was widely promoted in the areas along the Yangtze River, and rice was vigorously replanted in the areas along the Huai River. The planting area of high-yield crops such as corn and Shengli No. 100 sweet potatoes was expanded. Most of these replanting measures achieved the goals of avoiding disasters, ensuring harvests, and increasing production. After the disasters, governments at all levels actively organized the masses to carry out sideline production to increase the income of cooperative members and make up for disaster losses. Thanks to the tenacious struggle of the people of the province, we once again overcame the severe drought. From the perspective of the income of agricultural production cooperatives, about 53% of the cooperatives achieved increased production, about 10% maintained production, and 34% reduced production due to more severe disasters. Only about 3.5% of the cooperatives reduced production due to poor management. The vast majority of the cooperatives that increased production ensured that more than 90% of their members increased their income. Widows, widowers, orphans, and other households in difficulty were all provided with the "five guarantees" and received appropriate care. We can affirm that if agricultural collectivization had not been implemented, it would have been impossible to overcome such a large natural disaster and achieve such great results in production.

It must also be stated that the strong support of the state played a very important role in our province's disaster relief and agricultural collectivization last year, and promptly solved many difficulties for poor farmers in joining cooperatives and for disaster victims in terms of production and livelihood. In 1956, the relief funds issued by our province were equivalent to 53.5% of the province's agricultural tax revenue for that year. If we add various expenditures in agriculture (including water conservancy), the total was more than twice the agricultural tax revenue for that year. In addition, a large amount of agricultural loans and advance purchase deposits for grain and economic crops were issued, totaling 4.58 billion jin of grain. The scale was huge, the timing of the issuance was appropriate, and the care was comprehensive, which had never happened in any dynasty. Especially during the autumn sowing season, the government organized a large number of people to transport more than 400 million jin of improved varieties from eight provinces, including Sichuan, day and night, and lent or exchanged them to agricultural cooperatives in a timely manner, which not only ensured timely sowing but also enabled about 70% of the wheat in the Huai River basin of our province to be sown with improved varieties, resulting in a general bumper harvest this summer. Therefore, we can say that although some planning arrangements were too large last year, and the state issued some extra money, causing some difficulties in the supply of materials and the planning arrangements for this year, we should learn from the experience; but from an objective point of view, it still strongly supported the development of production and did good things for the people.

With the strong support of the state, our province's disaster relief work not only met the requirement of "no one starving to death in disaster relief," but also enabled the lives of the majority of farmers to improve even in a year of great disaster. First of all, in terms of grain possession in rural areas, the average rural population of the province possessed 655 jin of grain per person, an increase of 38 jin compared to 1955. The amount possessed in non-disaster areas was greater than the provincial average, but the grain supply standard in disaster areas was also higher than in the past. Secondly, in terms of sales of daily necessities, there was a significant increase compared to the bumper year of 1955. If the sales volume in 1955 was 100, then the sales volume in 1956 was: cotton cloth 115.12, towels 140.88, bamboo shell thermos bottles 132.4, rubber shoes 138.79, soap 118.06, and wine 103.95. In the first quarter of this year, the sales volume of daily necessities in the 15 heavily affected counties such as Yingshang and Huaiyuan accounted for the following percentages of the sales volume in the same period last year: cotton cloth 79.87, towels 111, bamboo shell thermos bottles 153.3, rubber shoes 189.66, soap 135.76, cigarettes 127.31, and wine 147.55. Although the sales volume of cotton cloth decreased somewhat, a large number of clothes were donated by government agencies, employees, military officers and soldiers, and Shanghai and other places to support the severely affected areas, which in effect offset the reduced consumption of cotton cloth sales in the first quarter of this year. Here, I once again express my gratitude on behalf of the people in the disaster areas. Furthermore, in terms of the living conditions of the masses in the disaster areas, although there are some difficulties, they are generally normal. Clothing is generally better than in the past, and the phenomenon of people being poorly clad and in rags is rarely seen. The number of migrants from outside the province is also much smaller than in previous years, and most of them are looking for temporary work in large cities and industrial and mining areas. For example, many of the disaster victims who were mobilized to return to their hometowns from Shanghai, Xi'an, and other places by our province's personnel had dozens of yuan in RMB with them when they left, and some were unwilling to stay in the disaster relief reception stations set up by the government when they returned, and went to stay in hotels at their own expense, which is enough to show their living conditions.

Last year, although our province achieved great results in rural work, there were also some shortcomings and mistakes. After collectivization, the political and ideological education of farmers was not strengthened accordingly; when conducting socialist long-term publicity, the arduousness of the construction process was not emphasized; and education on thrift and diligence in managing households was also insufficient. As a result, many farmers still lack a comprehensive understanding of socialism and "taking the cooperative as their home," and their demands for improving their lives are too high and too urgent, and there is a mentality of simply relying on agricultural cooperatives and the government. Taking disaster relief as an example, in the early days of liberation, the government provided disaster victims with 4 to 6 liang of rice per person per day, and the masses were very grateful. Now, the prescribed relief standard for disaster victims is 12 liang of grain per person per day during the slack season and 1 jin of grain during the busy season, but the masses still complain that it is too little. In addition, there is bureaucracy in our work, and some problems that could have been solved have not been resolved in a timely and appropriate manner, which led to the phenomenon of making trouble over grain and relief in a few places in the disaster areas this spring. Secondly, when promoting agricultural production reforms, although we emphasized adapting to local conditions and times, the specific inspection and assistance were insufficient. In some places, the masses were not seriously mobilized for discussion during the promotion; some adopted simple administrative orders, and did not follow the principle of adapting to local conditions and blindly copied and applied them, regardless of local specific conditions and agricultural time, resulting in some unnecessary losses. Furthermore, on the scale of agricultural production cooperatives, some places blindly pursued large sizes, making production management inconvenient. Some cooperatives did not implement contracting work and assigning production, and their financial systems were not sound, and non-productive expenditures were too large. There were also a few members and cadres who loved small gains or embezzlement, which affected the consolidation of cooperatives.

We have already taken many measures to check and correct these problems. This spring, our province conducted a general rectification of agricultural cooperatives. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Anhui Provincial People's Committee, based on the model charter of agricultural cooperatives and the relevant instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, combined with our province's experience over the past year, made 18 specific provisions for solving some of the problems existing in agricultural cooperatives, and widely publicized and implemented them. Overly large cooperatives and teams have been appropriately reduced in size according to the actual situation. The methods of contracting work and assigning production, excess production belonging to the team, and compensation for reduced production have been generally implemented. The financial accounts of the cooperatives have been cleared up, the principle of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily" has been implemented, non-productive expenditures have been reduced, and cadres have also participated in production together with the members. While rectifying the cooperatives, the government has also actively improved grain work. On the one hand, the grain supply standard in disaster areas during the busy season has been increased, and the amount of grain transferred and the necessary livestock feed in non-disaster areas have been increased. On the other hand, the grain purchase task for 1957 has been assigned to the cooperatives, and reductions will be made after the autumn if there are disasters, so that the cooperatives and members have a clear idea of how much grain the state will purchase in 1957, so as to arrange production. It is also stipulated that 60% of the grain overproduced by the production team after completing the contracting work and assigning production tasks will be distributed to the members who overproduced, and the other 40% will be sold to the state by the cooperative or used for internal adjustments as needed. In terms of production guidance, the government has adopted the method of consulting with the masses. The production plan is first proposed from top to bottom, adapting to local conditions to put forward target requirements, and then discussed democratically from bottom to top in conjunction with contracting work and assigning production before being finalized. It is stipulated that double-cropping rice should not be planted after the summer solstice, and late rice should not be planted after the beginning of autumn, to prevent sowing from being delayed. The above-mentioned measures must be implemented by cadres at all levels. In addition to constantly dispatching a large number of cadres to the countryside to help with the work, the leading organs at the provincial, special, and county levels also combine the reorganization and merging of districts and townships, decentralize cadres to strengthen the leadership of counties and townships, and send 17,950 people to agricultural cooperatives to specifically lead production. In particular, many responsible cadres at the provincial, special, and county levels work with the masses when they go to the countryside to help with production, creating a very good impact among the masses and closely linking the masses and the government. This has enabled many contradictions between cooperatives and teams, teams and teams, cooperatives (teams) and members, and cooperatives and the state to be resolved in a timely and appropriate manner, and some contradictions are being gradually resolved, which has greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the broad masses. I believe that through this rectification movement, we will be able to further overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy ideologically, and will be able to better handle the contradictions within the people correctly in accordance with the principles instructed by Chairman Mao. At the same time, in the rectification movement, we welcome well-intentioned criticisms of our government work on the one hand; on the other hand, we must distinguish right from wrong, be vigilant, and resolutely defeat the attacks of the right-wing elements to ensure and accelerate the development of our socialist cause.

### 大灾之年生活也提高了

    大灾之年生活也提高了
    余亚农的发言中说，安徽省去年遇到了十分严重的自然灾害，但广大农民的生活仍能有所提高：全省农村人口平均每人占有粮食六百五十五斤，比1955年增加三十八斤；日用品的销售量也增长了很多。
    我完全拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告。并完全同意李、薄两位副总理和张检察长、董院长、彭副委员长所作的工作报告。我们认为，一九五六年中央所采取的方针是完全正确的，这不仅为全国社会主义改造和社会主义建设取得的伟大成就所证明，而且从我们安徽省一年来执行中央的方针所取得的各项成绩来说，也得到了充分的具体的证明。现在我仅就安徽省一年来农村工作方面的情况，发表一些意见。
    一九五六年，我们安徽全省实现了农业合作化，入社农户共达六百八十万户，占全省总农户的百分之九十八点一三，其中加入高级社的农户，占总农户的百分之九十四点八四。这样使我省农村的生产关系发生了根本改变，使千百万农民走上了社会主义的道路。从而就消灭了小农经济向两极分化的危险，避免了走资本主义道路的苦难。
    我省实现合作化的第一年，就遇到了十分严重的自然灾害。去年的夏收作物曾遭受五个月未下过透雨的大旱，小麦普遍生疸，部分受涝；秋季作物先后遭受九次大暴雨和一次强台风的袭击，先后受涝的播种面积共达八千余万亩，占总播种面积的百分之五十左右。在与自然灾害斗争中，农业生产合作社显示了巨大的优越性，发挥了集体的抗灾力量。广大社员在“与水争地”、“与水争粮”的口号下，积极下水抢收，扶棵救苗，排涝补种，经过四排五种者有数百万亩，斗争的艰苦是可以设想的。同时，各地农业社，都大规模地推行了农业生产改革，沿江地区普遍推广了双季稻，沿淮地区大力改种了水稻，并扩大了玉米、胜利百号山芋等高产作物的种植面积。这些改种措施，绝大部分都达到了避灾保收和增产的目的。受灾后，各级政府积极组织群众开展了副业生产，增加社员的收入，弥补受灾损失。由于全省人民进行了顽强的斗争，因而又一次的战胜了严重的灾荒。从农业生产合作社的收益来看，则约有百分之五十三的社得到了增产，百分之十左右的社保产，百分之三十四的社因为受灾较重减产，而因管理不善减产的社仅占百分之三点五左右。增产社绝大部分做到了百分之九十以上的社员增加了收入，鳏寡孤独等困难户都实行了五保，得到了适当的照顾。我们可以肯定，如果不是实行了农业合作化，要想战胜这样大的自然灾害，在生产上取得这样大的成绩，是不可能的。
    还须说明一点，就是国家的大力支持，对于我省去年的生产救灾和农业合作化起了非常重要的作用，及时的解决了贫苦农民入社基金和灾民生产、生活方面的许多困难。一九五六年我省发放的救济款相等于当年全省农业税收的百分之五十三点五，如加上农业方面（包括水利）的各项支出，则共为当年农业税收的两倍以上。另外，还发放了大量的农业贷款及粮食、经济作物的预购定金，总额共可折合粮食四十五亿八千万斤，其数量之巨大，发放之适时，照顾之周到，是任何朝代都没有过的。特别是在秋种时，政府组织了大批人力，星夜从四川等八省调运了四亿多斤优良品种，及时贷放或者换给农业社，不仅保证了适时下种，而且使我省淮河流域广大地区有百分之七十左右的小麦都用良种播种，使今年夏季得到了普遍的丰收。因此，我们可以说，虽然去年由于某些计划安排偏大，国家多发放了些钱，造成了物资供应和今年计划安排上的某些困难，应当从中吸取经验；但从客观效果上看还是有力的支持了生产的发展，为人民办了好事的。
    在国家的大力支持下，我省的生产救灾工作，不仅做到了“救灾不饿死人”的要求，而且使广大农民的生活在大灾之年仍能有所提高。首先，以农村的粮食占有量来说，全省农村人口平均每人占有粮食六百五十五斤，比一九五五年增加三十八斤，其中非灾区的占有量要多于全省平均数，但灾区的粮食供应标准亦较过去提高。其次，以日用品销售量来说，较丰收的一九五五年还有很大的增长。如一九五五年的销售量为一百，则一九五六年的销售量为：棉布一百一十五点一二，毛巾一百四十点八八，竹壳热水瓶一百三十二点四，胶鞋一百三十八点七九，肥皂一百一十八点零六，酒一百零三点九五。今年第一季度颍上、怀远等十五个重灾县，日用品销售量占去年同期销售量的百分数为：棉布七十九点八七，毛巾一百一十一，竹壳热水瓶一百五十三点三，胶鞋一百八十九点六六，肥皂一百三十五点七六，纸烟一百二十七点三一，酒一百四十七点五五。棉布销售量虽然有所减少，但去冬各机关职工、部队官兵及上海等地捐献了大批衣服支援了重灾区，这在实际上就抵补了今年第一季度棉布销售量减少部分的消费。在这里，我再一次代表灾区人民表示感谢。再以灾区群众生活情况来说，虽然存在着某些困难，但一般都是正常的。衣着普遍比过去好，衣不遮体，破烂不堪的现象很少看到；外进灾民亦较历年大为减少，并且大多数是为了到大城市、工矿区寻找临时工作的。如我省派员从上海、西安等地动员回乡的灾民，很多人去时随身带有人民币几十元，回来时有的不愿住政府设的灾民接待站，而去自费住旅馆，这都足以说明他们的生活情况。
    去年我省在农村工作方面，虽然取得的成绩是巨大的，但也存在着一些缺点和错误。在合作化后，对农民的政治思想教育工作，没有相应的加强；在进行社会主义远景宣传时，没有强调指出建设过程的艰苦性；勤俭持家的教育也很不够。因而很多农民对社会主义、对“以社为家”还缺乏全面的了解，对生活改善要求的过高过急，存在着单纯依赖农业社和政府的思想。以救灾为例，解放初期政府救济灾民每人每天口粮四两至六两大米，群众即感恩不尽；现在规定灾民每人每天救济标准，农闲时十二两粮，农忙时一斤粮，但群众还嫌少。再加上我们工作中存在有官僚主义，有些可能解决的问题，没有得到及时妥善解决，以致今年春季灾区的少数地方曾发生了闹粮食闹救济的现象。其次，在推行农业生产改革时，我们虽然强调了因地因时制宜，但具体检查帮助不够。有些地方在推行时，未认真发动群众讨论；有的采取单纯的行政命令办法，不按照因地因时制宜的原则，盲目的硬搬硬套，不顾当地具体条件和农时，结果造成了一些不应有的损失。再者，在农业生产合作社的规模上，曾有些地方盲目贪大，致使生产管理不便，有些社未实行包工包产，财务制度也不健全，非生产开支过大；并有少数社员和干部爱小便宜或贪污的现象，影响了合作社的巩固。
    以上这些问题，我们已经采取许多措施，进行检查纠正。今年春季我省对农业社普遍地进行了一次整顿工作，中共安徽省委和安徽省人民委员会根据农业社示范章程和中共中央、国务院的有关指示，结合我省一年来的经验，对于解决农业社中存在的若干问题作了十八条具体规定，广泛的进行宣传贯彻。对于过大的社、队都按实际情况适当划小，普遍推行了包工包产、超产归队、减产赔偿的办法，清理了社里的财务账目，贯彻了“勤俭办社”方针，减少了非生产开支，干部也都和社员一起参加生产。与整社同时，政府还积极改进了粮食工作。一方面提高了灾区在农忙时的粮食供应标准，增加了非灾区的调剂粮和必要的牲口饲料；另方面将一九五七年粮食征购任务分配到社，秋后有灾照减，使社和社员对一九五七年国家征购多少粮食有个底，以便安排生产。并规定生产队完成包工包产任务超产的粮食，以百分之六十分配给超产了的社员，另外百分之四十由社根据需要卖给国家或作社内调剂。在生产指导上，政府采取了和群众商量的办法，生产计划先由上而下，因地制宜的提出指标要求，再由下而上结合包工包产，进行民主讨论而后定案；对推广双季稻规定了夏至后不栽早稻，立秋后不栽晚稻，以防播种失时。上述各种措施，都要通过各级干部贯彻执行的，省、专、县各级领导机关，除了不断的抽调大批干部下乡帮助工作外，还结合整编及撤区并乡，下放干部加强县、乡的领导，并有一万七千九百五十人下放到农业社具体领导生产。特别是省、专、县许多负责干部在下乡帮助生产时和群众一同劳动，在群众中造成了极好的影响，密切了群众和政府的关系。这就使社与队、队与队、社（队）与社员、社与国家的许多矛盾及时得到了适当的解决，有些矛盾则正在逐步解决，从而也就大大鼓舞了广大群众的生产积极性。我相信，通过这次整风运动，将可以更进一步地从思想上克服主观主义和官僚主义，将能够更好的按照毛主席指示的原则，正确处理人民内部的矛盾。同时，在整风运动中，我们一方面欢迎对我们政府工作的善意批评；另一方面要明辨是非，提高警惕，坚决击溃右派分子的进攻。以保障和加速发展我们的社会主义事业。
