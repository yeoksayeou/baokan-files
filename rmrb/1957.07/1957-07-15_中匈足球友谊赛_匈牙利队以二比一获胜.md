    China-Hungary Football Friendly
    Hungary Wins 2-1

    (Our dispatch) The Hungarian National Football Team's third team played a friendly match yesterday at the Beijing Xian Nong Tan Stadium against the Chinese Football League's second team. The visiting team won 2-1.
    The first half of the match proceeded at a leisurely pace. It wasn't until the 18th minute that the visiting team's left winger Dorigi, left inside forward Lauhos, and center forward Opova used a series of crossing short passes from the left side, breaking past the home team's defense. With a resounding shot from center forward Opova, the ball entered the net from the right corner of the goal, opening the scoring. Less than a minute after the restart, the home team's left winger Cui Hengxie received the ball in midfield and, single-handedly, stormed the visiting team's territory. The visiting team's goalkeeper Deluk was caught off guard, and the ball flew straight into the net, leveling the score. The 1-1 draw was maintained until the end of the first half. In the 15th minute of the second half, the visiting team's right winger Jokotić scored a goal amidst the chaos. The final score was 2-1.
    After the match, many spectators expressed their opinions to our reporter through interviews or phone calls: the match was not intense or enthusiastic enough, and there were a relatively large number of fouls.

    中匈足球友谊赛
    匈牙利队以二比一获胜
    本报讯　匈牙利国家足球队第三队，昨天在北京市先农坛体育场与我国足球联队二队举行友谊比赛。客队以二比一获胜。
    上半场的前半段比赛，是在慢条斯理的状态中进行的。直到第十八分钟时，客队左翼道里格、左内锋劳霍士和中锋奥波瓦三人，才从左边使出了交叉短传，?过了主队的后卫，随着中锋奥波瓦的声响球从门的右角入网，首开纪录。比赛重新开始不到一分钟，主队左翼崔亨燮从中场得球，单枪匹马，直捣客队腹地，客队守门员德娄克措手不及，球儿直飞网底形成一平。一比一的和局一直保持到上半场终了。下半场十五分钟时客队右翼约可蒂契在乱军中射入一球。最后以二比一告终。
    比赛结束后，很多观众都用面谈或电话的方式向本报记者反映他们的观感：比赛不够紧张不够热烈，犯规次数比较多。
