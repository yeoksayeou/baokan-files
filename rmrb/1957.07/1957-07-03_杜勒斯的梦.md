Dulles' Dream
By Our Staff Commentator

When the Chinese bourgeois rightists launched their frenzied attack on the proletariat this time, the American imperialists were smug and gleeful. They excitedly dusted off their old White Papers, thinking that the realization of the White Paper's ideals seemed to be within reach. Eight years ago, when the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people against the traitorous rule of Chiang Kai-shek was winning a decisive victory on the mainland, the US State Department published a White Paper on the China issue. This White Paper, which nakedly exposed the American imperialists' ambitions to invade China, educated the Chinese people, especially the patriotic intellectuals – the so-called "democratic individualists." Because the American "White Paper" openly admitted that the likes of Marshall and Stuart had attempted to use the means of organizing anti-communist factions within the Chinese democratic camp to enable the tottering reactionary regime of Chiang Kai-shek to "regain its grip on intellectuals and the masses." And then US Secretary of State Acheson placed the hope of restoring capitalism in China on these "democratic individualists" in China. Acheson wrote at the time: "We continue to believe that in the near future... China's long civilization and democratic individualism will eventually rise again, and China will eventually overthrow foreign fetters (referring to the Chinese people's regime). I believe we should encourage all developments in China that are working now or in the future to achieve this goal.”

The American "White Paper" then opened the eyes of many Chinese intellectuals. The vast majority of patriotic intellectuals abandoned their illusions about the United States and embarked on the path of sharing the destiny with the people. After eight years of earth-shaking changes in Chinese society, a large part of these intellectuals have firmly supported socialism, and some have even joined the Chinese Communist Party. There are also some who are not yet accustomed to the socialist system. They still need time and effort to adjust the relationship between their individuals and the social collective. This is originally a normal phenomenon and not surprising.

However, among the intellectuals in China, there is also such a small group of people. They verbally support the Communist Party and socialism, but in reality, they are dissatisfied with and hostile to the Communist Party and socialism. They have a strong liking for and illusions about the United States, and they are extremely attached to capitalism and bourgeois parliamentary politics. The further the Chinese socialist revolution and socialist construction develop, the more eager they are to jump off the bus and go back, just like passengers who have boarded the wrong bus. This small group of people are the rightists among Chinese intellectuals, that is, the "democratic individualists" that Acheson was counting on. They are Acheson's potential allies in China. Like Acheson, they pin their ambitions on those intellectuals whose bourgeois ideas have not been completely eradicated.

Eight years have passed. Dulles replaced Acheson. But the American plot to subvert the Chinese revolution by using Chinese intellectual rightists has not been realized. Eight years have passed. China has completed the socialist revolution after completing the new democratic revolution, but the Chinese intellectual rightists' plan to seize political leadership has not been realized. The Chinese rightists have held their breath for eight years under the pressure of the people, and the rectification movement launched by the Chinese Communist Party made them feel that the day of their rise had come. They used this opportunity to attack the Communist Party and the socialist revolution led by the Communist Party, develop organizations, and win over intellectuals, attempting to realize their ambitions. This frenzied attack by the Chinese rightists on the Communist Party immediately aroused cheers from across the Pacific Ocean.

The US Information Service attaches great importance to the absurd remarks of the Chinese rightists. It rebroadcast the words of Ge Peiqi, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Long Yun, and others, praising their "stubbornness." The "New York Times" even said that Long Yun's words of inciting Sino-Soviet relations were "very useful" and "a good thing." In a speech extremely hostile to the Chinese people on June 28, Dulles specifically quoted the words of Ge Peiqi, a lecturer at the Chinese People's University, who cursed the Chinese Communist Party, and praised them as "brave words." Dulles also concluded that the Chinese people do not like communism.

The "Chinese people" in Dulles' mind are nothing more than the "democratic individualists" in Acheson's mind. Because Dulles then said: "The Chinese people are first and foremost individualists." Dulles was happy to find that "democratic individualists" had not disappeared in China, and therefore "confidently" assumed that socialist China "is a passing, not a permanent phenomenon." Dulles also put forward the same proposition as Acheson put forward eight years ago. But this time, it is not only to cheer on the American aggressors, but also to cheer on the Chinese rightists who are being countered by the people. Dulles said this: "We believe that it is the responsibility of ourselves, our allies, and the Chinese people to do everything possible to make this phenomenon disappear."

Of course, Dulles is just following Acheson's old dream that has already been shattered. On the issue of China policy, the United States has become a fish stranded in a dry rut, unable to move. And the rightists among the Chinese bourgeoisie and intellectuals have also become fish stranded in a dry rut, washed ashore by the socialist tide of the Chinese people. Dulles, this fish in a dry rut, is now moistening the Chinese rightists, this fish in a dry rut, with saliva, but bubbles are just bubbles after all. If they want to rely on this bubble to jump into the socialist sea of China and muddy the water, it can only be a dream that can never be realized.

Dulles indeed regards the Chinese "democratic individualists" as his confidants, and has given them the task of cooperating with the United States, internally and externally, to overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship in China and establish American colonial rule. The Chinese people should thank Dulles. Look, Dulles is once again giving the Chinese people a thought-provoking political lesson.

    杜勒斯的梦
    本报评论员
    当中国资产阶级右派分子这次向无产阶级进行猖狂进攻的时候，美国帝国主义分子沾沾自喜，他们兴高采烈地翻开了过去的白皮书，以为实现白皮书的理想似乎有了指望了。八年以前，在中国人民反对蒋介石卖国统治的革命斗争在大陆上胜局已定的时候，美国国务院曾经发表了一个关于中国问题的白皮书。这个赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义侵略中国的野心的白皮书，当时曾经教育了中国人民，特别是中国的爱国的知识分子们——所谓“民主个人主义者”们。因为，美国的“白皮书”公开承认，马歇尔和司徒雷登之流，曾经企图用在中国民主阵营内部组织反共派别的手段，使得摇摇欲坠的蒋介石反动政权“能恢复把握住知识分子和群众”。而当时的美国国务卿艾奇逊，也把在中国复辟资本主义的希望寄托在中国的这些“民主个人主义者”身上。艾奇逊当时曾经这样写道：“我们继续相信，在不久的将来……中国的悠久文明和民主个人主义终将再起，中国终将推翻外来的羁绊（指中国的人民政权）。我认为我们应当鼓励在中国的一切发展，这些发展在现在或将来都是为了达到这个目标而工作。”
    美国的“白皮书”当时擦亮了中国许多知识分子的眼睛。绝大多数爱国的知识分子放弃了对美国的幻想，走上了同人民共命运的道路。经过中国社会八年来的惊天动地的变化，这些知识分子中的一大部分人，已经坚定地拥护社会主义，有的还参加了中国共产党。其中也有一部分人，对于社会主义制度还不大习惯。他们还需要时间和努力，来调整他们个人同社会集体之间的关系。这原是正常的现象，不足为奇。
    但是，在中国的知识分子里面，也有这么一小批人。他们口头上拥护共产党，拥护社会主义，但是实际上却对共产党和社会主义心怀不满，抱着敌视的态度。他们对于美国具有强烈的好感和幻想，对于资本主义和资产阶级议会政治不胜依恋。中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设愈是往前发展，他们就像坐错了车子的乘客一样愈是急于想跳车走回头去。这一小批人是中国知识分子中的右派，也就是艾奇逊所指望的“民主个人主义者”。他们是艾奇逊在中国的潜在的同盟者。他们像艾奇逊一样，把自己的野心寄托在那些资产阶级思想的孽根未净的知识分子身上。
    八年过去了。杜勒斯替换了艾奇逊。可是美国利用中国知识分子右派颠复中国革命的阴谋没有实现。八年过去了。中国在完成了新民主主义革命以后又完成了社会主义革命，可是中国知识分子右派夺取政治领导权的打算没有实现。中国的右派分子在人民的压力下面憋了八年的气，中国共产党开展整风运动使他们觉得出头的日子来了。他们利用这个机会大肆攻击共产党和共产党领导的社会主义革命，发展组织，拉拢知识分子，企图实现他们的野心。中国右派分子对共产党的这种猖狂进攻，立即引起了太平洋彼岸的喝采声。
    美国新闻处对中国右派分子的荒谬言论，极为重视。它转播了葛佩琦、章伯钧、章乃器、储安平、龙云等人所说的话，称赞他们的“倔强”。“纽约时报”还把龙云的挑拨中苏关系的话说作是“很有用的”、“一件好事”。杜勒斯在6月28日发表的极端敌视中国人民的演说中，特地引用了中国人民大学讲师葛佩琦所说的咒骂中国共产党的话，并且夸奖为“勇敢的话”。杜勒斯并且据以得出结论说，中国人民不喜欢共产主义。
    杜勒斯心目中的“中国人民”，无非就是艾奇逊心目中的“民主个人主义者”。因为杜勒斯接着就说：“中国人民首先是个人主义者”。杜勒斯因为发现“民主个人主义者”在中国还没有绝迹而感到高兴，并且因此而“有信心地”假设社会主义的中国“是一种要消逝的、而不是一种永久的现象”。杜勒斯还提出了同艾奇逊在八年以前提出的一模一样的主张。不过这一次不仅是为了给美国的侵略分子打气，也是为了给遭到人民反击的中国的右派分子打气。杜勒斯是这样说的：“我们认为，尽一切可能使这种现象消逝，是我们自己、我们的盟国和中国人民的责任。”
    当然，杜勒斯只是在依着艾奇逊早经破灭的旧梦。在对中国的政策问题上，美国已经成了一条动弹不得的涸辙之鲋。而中国资产阶级和知识分子中的右派分子，也已经成为被中国人民的社会主义的浪潮冲上岸来的涸辙之鲋。杜勒斯这条涸辙之鲋，现在对中国右派分子这条涸辙之鲋濡之以沫，可是泡沫毕竟只是泡沫。他们要想凭着这点泡沫跳进中国的社会主义大海，把海水搞混，那只能是永远不能实现的幻梦。
    杜勒斯的确把中国的“民主个人主义者”看作是自己的心腹，并且向他们交代了任务，要他们配合美国，里应外合，来推翻中国的人民民主专政，建立美国的殖民统治。中国人民应该感谢杜勒斯，你看，杜勒斯又在给中国人民上了一堂值得深思的政治课。
