Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued its plenary discussions this afternoon. Thirteen representatives from various regions spoke at today's meeting.

The speaking representatives unanimously agreed with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and other reports of the congress. They cited specific situations in their respective regions to further illustrate the great achievements made in various tasks over the past year, and put forward criticisms and suggestions regarding relevant government work. Some representatives also sternly refuted the absurd remarks of the right-wing elements who oppose the Party and socialism.

The representatives who spoke at today's meeting included Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission; Yu Kaiquan, Hydraulic Engineer of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry; Xi Rao Jia Cuo, President of the Buddhist Association of China and Vice Governor of Qinghai Province; Wu Zhipu, Governor of Henan Province; Ning Wu, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province; Zhu Jiu (female), Industrial Labor Model of Hubei Province; Rao Xingli, Agricultural Labor Model of Hubei Province; Wang Yanan, President of Xiamen University; Qian Changzhao, Member of the NPC Legislative Affairs Commission; Li Minghao, Vice Governor of Hubei Province; and Li Hui (female), Deputy Commissioner of the Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province. Ma Yinchu, President of Peking University, and Pan Shu, President of Nanjing University, submitted written speeches at the meeting.

The executive chairmen presiding over today's meeting were: Shen Junru, Lin Feng, Lai Ruoyu, Xiong Kewu, Hu Heletei, Lin Qiaozhi, Chen Yuan, and Rao Xingli.

Today's meeting began at 3:00 PM and ended at 6:55 PM. The meeting will continue tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress held group discussions this morning, continuing to expose and criticize the erroneous words and deeds of bourgeois right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun.

Zhang Bojun made a self-criticism at the Anhui Province delegation meeting today. Zhang Bojun admitted to his alliance relationship with Luo Longji, saying, "The relationship between the Zhang-Luo alliance pointed out in the newspapers is not a false accusation." He said: "The two of us are of one mind and have formed an alliance from thought to work." Some representatives believed that Zhang Bojun's self-criticism was still very insincere and incomplete.

Yang Ziheng, representative of Gansu Province and Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, exposed some of Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks at the group meeting today. Yang Ziheng said that once this year, he went to Beijing for a meeting, and Zhang Bojun invited him and more than a dozen other people (Yang Ziheng did not specify who those people were) to his home for dinner. Zhang Bojun said to everyone: "Marxism is outdated. More than a hundred years ago, capitalists exploited workers to the extreme, and Marx created Marxism based on the situation at that time to carry out class struggle, which was powerful. But the thing that is planted in people's minds is to make people resist the rulers, and this kind of thinking is very useful for carrying out revolution, overthrowing the rulers, and seizing power. But now that power has been seized and the working class itself has become the ruler, the old set is outdated, and emphasizing it again will lead to struggles against ourselves. Stalin made such a mistake, so the social system must be changed."

Yang Ziheng said that Zhang Bojun also maliciously distorted Chairman Mao's words to promote his idea that "the world is about to change drastically." After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Zhang Bojun shouted that he had "seen through" the development of the situation, saying, "The world is about to change, and the Soviet Union is also about to change." Zhang Bojun said: "Chairman Mao put forward ten articles last year (referring to the 'Ten Major Relationships') and twelve articles this year (referring to the speech 'On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'), which is to make greater changes, while dogmatists have a short-sighted vision and ignore the objective facts at home and abroad. They want to rule forever." Zhang Bojun said that in fact, "the Polish and Hungarian incidents are lessons."

During the China Democratic League work conference in April this year, Zhang Bojun, in conversations with Yang Ziheng and others, revealed a great admiration for international revisionists, and he also said some slanderous things about the Soviet Union.

Zhang Bojun also said that world politics will also move towards "democracy," and he believed that "the democratic life in Britain is very worthy of attention, and the democracy in Hyde Park in Britain is very good."

Zhang Bojun also said to Yang Ziheng: "There are two things in life, one is material and the other is spiritual. Just asking him to wear suits, live in tall buildings, and eat Western food, but not asking him to think independently, is like the lions and tigers in the Western Suburbs Park. Although they eat well, they have no freedom."

After Yang Ziheng spoke, the representatives of Gansu Province believed that it was good for him to make an expose, but it was not thorough enough, and they hoped that he would make further disclosures.

At the Jiangsu Province delegation meeting, Shi Liang, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic League, said that the Zhang-Luo alliance was not a matter of one morning or evening, and their anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds were too numerous to count. She said that Zhang Bojun had always been unconvinced of the leadership of the Communist Party; after the Hungarian incident, Zhang Bojun often said: "Look, within three years (sometimes saying 'within two years' or 'within one year'), there must be changes in China."

Shi Liang said that once, Chairman Mao convened a Supreme State Council meeting, and the chairmen and vice-chairmen of the China Democratic League all attended. When Chairman Mao spoke, Zhang and Luo did not take notes, but when they conveyed it to the League, they embellished and even distorted the facts. They did not talk about other issues in Chairman Mao's speech, but only emphasized the Hungarian incident, Stalin's mistakes, and other aspects. After listening to Zhang and Luo's report, Shi Liang immediately pointed out that according to her records, some of the content that Zhang and Luo spoke about was not mentioned at the Supreme State Council meeting. This incident caused great dissatisfaction with Zhang and Luo.

At the Beijing delegation meeting, the famous mathematician Hua Luogeng exposed some of the reactionary words and deeds of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Hua Luogeng said that after Luo Longji underwent ideological remolding in Beijing universities, he expressed dissatisfaction with the idea of "taking off your pants and cutting off your tail" for the ideological remolding of intellectuals. He believed that one would have Marxism-Leninism even if one did not study Marxism-Leninism, and he declared that he himself had never studied Marxism-Leninism but had written articles with Marxism-Leninism. At that time, Zhang Bojun also said with a slanderous tone that Marxism-Leninism was not worth studying, and that studying it would only add some dogmas, and it would be better to study "Zeng Guofan's Family Letters."

The Guangdong Province delegation today asked those who had close alliance relations with Zhang and Luo to make a clear explanation. The representatives were particularly dissatisfied with Huang Qixiang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and Li Boqiu, Deputy Secretary-General, believing that they were the closest to Zhang Bojun, but their attitude was very ambiguous in the struggle to expose Zhang and Luo's conspiracy. Li Boqiu only talked about some situations that others had already talked about, such as how Zhang Bojun organized 21 symposiums in Beijing under the name of helping the Communist Party to rectify the style of work. As for himself, he did not talk about any specific facts, but only concluded that he himself was "deep into the fortress, coexisting peacefully, losing vigilance, and being trapped in a siege." Some representatives said that Li Boqiu, on the one hand, claimed to be a leftist and said how Zhang Bojun squeezed him out, but on the other hand, he accepted Zhang Bojun's instructions to set fires everywhere in Beijing and engage in extensive activities; and he was particularly enthusiastic about implementing Zhang Bojun's instructions on "large-scale organizational development," personally inviting guests and recruiting people. Some representatives said that since the opening of this National People's Congress, Li Boqiu often asked for leave, saying that he was going to help Zhang Bojun confess, but to this day he has not helped to produce anything. The representatives asked Li Boqiu not to avoid the substantive issues, as that would not do him any good. The Shanghai delegation today criticized some of the erroneous words and deeds of the three representatives of this group, Yang Yitang, Lin Handa, and Qian Duansheng. In today's speech, Yang Yitang only repeated some of Zhang Bojun's materials that had already been exposed in the newspapers, and did not explain his relationship with Zhang Bojun and the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance at all. Yang Yitang's speech aroused great dissatisfaction among the representatives. Hu Yuzhi pointed out that the Zhang-Luo alliance attempted to rely on two parties and two newspapers, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party was completely controllable by Zhang Bojun. Yang Yitang, as the Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, should explain how Zhang Bojun asked him to develop the organization and recruit troops.

    全国人民代表大会进行大会和分组讨论
    各地代表追击章罗联盟
    据新华社3日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天下午继续进行大会讨论。来自各地的十三位人民代表在今天的会议上发了言。
    发言的代表一致同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告及大会的其他各项报告，并且举出各地的具体情况进一步说明了过去一年来各项工作取得的巨大成就和对有关的政府工作提出了批评、建议。其中有些代表并对右派分子的反党反社会主义的荒谬言论，进行了严正的驳斥。
    今天在会议上发言的，有国防委员会副主席张治中、电力工业部水电工程师于开泉、中国佛教协会会长、青海省副省长喜饶嘉错、河南省省长吴芝圃、辽宁省副省长宁武、湖北省工业劳动模范朱玖（女）、湖北省农业劳动模范饶兴礼、厦门大学校长王亚南、人大法案委员会委员钱昌照、湖北省副省长李明灏、山西省晋南专署副专员李辉（女）。北京大学校长马寅初和南京大学校长潘菽在会议上作了书面发言。
    主持今天会议的执行主席是：沈钧儒、林枫、赖若愚、熊克武、胡和勒泰、林巧稚、陈垣、饶兴礼。
    今天的会议在下午三时开始，六时五十五分结束。明天，会议将继续举行。
    新华社3日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天上午分组讨论，继续揭发和批判了章伯钧等资产阶级右派分子的错误言行。
    章伯钧今天在安徽省代表小组会上作了检讨。章伯钧承认了和罗隆基的联盟关系，他说，“报上指出的章罗联盟的关系，不是冤枉的。”他说：“我们两人心心相印，从思想到工作结成了联盟”。有的代表认为章伯钧的检讨仍很不老实，很不彻底。
    甘肃省代表、民盟甘肃省委员会主任委员杨子恒，今天在小组会上揭发了章伯钧的一些反动言行。杨子恒说，今年有一次他到北京开会，章伯钧曾请他和另外十几个人（杨子恒没有交代是那些人）到家里吃饭，章伯钧对大家说：“马克思主义已经过时了，一百几十年以前，资本家剥削工人到了极点，马克思根据那时的情况，创造出马克思主义进行阶级斗争，这是有力量的；但它种到人们头脑中的东西是要人们反抗统治者，这种思想对于搞革命、推倒统治者、夺取政权很有用。但是现在已经取得了政权，工人阶级自己成了统治者，以前那一套就过时了，再强调就会引导到对自己的斗争。斯大林就是犯了这样的错误，因此社会制度要变一变。”
    杨子恒说，章伯钧还恶意地歪曲毛主席的话来宣扬他的“天下要大变”的思想。苏共二十次大会以后，章伯钧大叫“看中了”形势的发展，说“天下要变，苏联也要变”。章伯钧说：“毛主席去年提出十条（指十大关系），今年提出十二条（指关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话），就是要作更大的转变，而教条主义者眼光短浅，不顾国际国内的客观事实，他们想永远统治下去。”章伯钧说，其实“波匈事件就是教训”。
    今年4月民盟工作会议期间，章伯钧同杨子恒等人谈话中，曾经流露出对国际上的修正主义者十分崇拜的情绪，他还讲了一些诬蔑苏联的话。
    章伯钧还曾经说，世界政治还要走上“民主”，他认为“英国的民主生活很值得注意，英国海德公园的民主就很好”。
    章伯钧还对杨子恒说：“生活有二个东西，一个是物质的，一个是精神的。仅仅叫他穿西服、住高楼、吃西餐，而不叫他独立思考，这就好比西郊公园里的狮子和老虎，吃的虽好，可没有自由。”
    杨子恒发言后，甘肃省代表们认为他能够进行揭发是好的，但是还不彻底，希望他作进一步的揭露。
    在江苏省代表小组会上，中国民主同盟副主席史良说，章罗联盟不是一朝一夕的事，他们反党反社会主义的言行讲不胜讲。她说，章伯钧对共产党的领导一直是不服的；匈牙利事件发生后，章伯钧经常说：“你看，三年之内（有时说“二年之内”或“一年之内”）中国一定要有变化。”
    史良说，有一次，毛主席召开最高国务会议，民盟的正副主席都参加了。毛主席讲话时，章罗二人都没记录，会后向盟内传达，他们却添油加醋甚至歪曲事实，他们不谈毛主席讲话中的其他问题，单只强调匈牙利事件、斯大林的错误等方面的问题。史良听了章罗的传达报告后立刻指出：根据她的记录，章罗讲的有些内容，最高国务会议上并没有讲。这件事引起章罗很大不满。
    在北京市代表小组会上，著名数学家华罗庚揭发章伯钧、罗隆基的一些反动言行。华罗庚说，罗隆基在北京高等学校进行思想改造后，对知识分子的思想改造要“脱裤子割尾巴”的提法颇表不满。他认为不学马列主义就有马列主义，并宣称他自己从不学马列主义却写出有马列主义的文章。当时，章伯钧还带着诬蔑的口气说，马列主义不值得学，学了也只是增加些教条，还不如学学“曾国藩家书”。
    广东省代表小组今天要那些同章罗同盟关系密切的人物，出来交代清楚。代表们特别对农工民主党副主席黄琪翔和副秘书长李伯球表示不满，认为他们是最接近章伯钧的人，但是在揭露章罗阴谋的斗争中，他们的态度却十分暧昧。李伯球今天只谈了章伯钧怎样以帮助共产党整风为名，在北京市组织二十一次座谈会等别人已经谈过的一些情况。至于他自己怎样，并没有谈出具体事实，只是作出结论说，他自己是“深入堡垒，和平共居，失去警惕，陷于重围”。有的代表说，李伯球一方面以左派自居，说章伯钧如何排挤他，可是一方面又接受章伯钧的指使，在北京到处点火，大肆活动；并对执行章伯钧“组织大发展”的指示特别热心，亲自出马请客拉人。有的代表说，这次全国人民代表大会开会，李伯球常常请假，说是要去帮助章伯钧交代，可是到今天并没有帮助出什么东西来。代表们要求李伯球不要避开实质问题，那样对自己并无好处。上海市代表小组今天对这个组的代表杨逸棠、林汉达、钱端升三人的一些错误言行进行了批判。杨逸棠在今天的发言中，只是把报上早已揭露过的章伯钧的一些材料重复了一遍，丝毫没有交代他和章伯钧的关系以及章罗联盟的反党、反社会主义阴谋活动。杨逸棠的发言引起代表们极大不满。胡愈之指出，章罗联盟是企图倚靠两个党派、两个报纸，而农工民主党是章伯钧完全可以控制的，杨逸棠作为农工民主党中央执行局的组织部副部长应该交代章伯钧怎样叫他发展组织、招兵买马的情况。
