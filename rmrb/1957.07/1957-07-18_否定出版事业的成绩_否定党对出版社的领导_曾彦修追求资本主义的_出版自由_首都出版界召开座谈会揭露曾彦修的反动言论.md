Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: The capital's publishing circle held consecutive symposiums on the 15th and 17th to expose and refute Zeng Yanxiu's anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds. More than a hundred people from the publishing industry and staff from dozens of publishing houses attended the symposium. Qian Junrui, Chen Kehan, and Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Ministers of the Ministry of Culture, also attended the symposium. Fourteen people spoke at the meeting.

	Thoroughly Refuting Rightist Arguments is the Only Way to Improve Publishing Work

	Huang Luofeng, Assistant Minister of Culture and Director of the Publishing Bureau, explained that the symposium had two purposes: one was to launch an anti-Rightist struggle in the publishing industry, and the other was to further study and improve publishing work. He said: In the past six months, especially after the rectification campaign, people in the cultural field have put forward many opinions on publishing work. The vast majority of these are good and have greatly helped to improve publishing work. We have already improved some work; we will propose solutions to some major issues and study them together with everyone. Huang Luofeng said: However, during the rectification campaign, a few Rightist elements launched malicious attacks on publishing work. Among them, Zeng Yanxiu, Deputy Director of the People's Publishing House and a Communist Party member, is a representative figure. We must thoroughly refute the rightist arguments, distinguish between major rights and wrongs, so that we can improve our work along the socialist road on the basis of ideological unity.

	The Achievements of the Publishing Industry are Enormous, and Rightist Elements Cannot Deny Them

	Veteran publisher Shu Xincheng refuted the reactionary argument of Rightist elements about the publishing industry "not as good as before" with his personal experience of working in publishing for forty years and the changes he has seen in the publishing industry before and after liberation. Shu Xincheng said: The prominent spirit of the publishing industry after liberation is to serve the broad masses of the people and socialism. This is fundamentally different from the publishing industry in the old society. The publishing industry in the old society was to safeguard the interests of the ruling class. Although a few intellectuals engaged in publishing with "conscience," the vast majority were "profit-oriented," engaged in "free competition," and there were also many briefcase bookstores, illegally printing manuscripts, publishing pornographic books, and publishing all kinds of messy books with discounts. Those engaged in the publishing industry were even illiterate. After liberation, the people's government carried out socialist transformation of private publishing, and pornographic publications and speculative bookstores were gradually eliminated; the bad habit of rushing to publish similar books to compete for the market was also gradually reformed. The government made unified arrangements for personnel in the old publishing industry, and the pricing standards for books and periodicals were gradually unified. In the past few years, many specialized publishing houses and local publishing houses have been established, and books and periodicals are distributed uniformly, so that readers in many remote areas can also buy books; in addition, national minority language publishing houses have been established, which have never existed in history. These achievements are very significant. Before liberation, the reactionary regime did not have any "leadership" over the publishing industry, only destruction, checking manuscripts, prohibiting distribution, and various localities could arbitrarily ban books, detain books, arrest editors, pressure managers, and extort money under various pretexts. I was sued for "Yangzhou Anecdotes" and fought a lawsuit, and finally settled the matter by sending more than a dozen "Sibu Beiyao". Regarding the system issue, Shu Xincheng said: The division of labor between publishing, printing, and distribution in the people's publishing industry is good. This can improve the quality of work in all aspects and meet the needs of the broad masses of the people. It can also save a lot of manpower and materials for the country. Some shortcomings in the implementation are secondary. The so-called publishing, printing, and distribution integration system in old China was not good, especially after liberation it was not suitable. The main reason for this at that time was to compete with peers, publishing books mainly for "ten thousand profits per book," and publishing books for academic purposes was very rare; in terms of printing, they often accepted external work for profit and shelved books and periodicals; they did not run bookstores and had no place to distribute. Shu Xincheng said: Of course, there are still areas for improvement in our publishing work, and I personally have some opinions on publishing work, but the rightist elements' negation of the great achievements of the people's publishing industry, opposition to the Party's leadership, and advocacy of restoring the capitalist operating system are all wrong, and I firmly oppose them. Shu Xincheng said: After liberation, we have added more than 40 million primary school students and more than 20 million adults to participate in literacy campaigns. These more than 60 million people need popular booklets. The Party has seen these people, so we have published many popular books that are beneficial to the people, but the rightist elements cannot see these 60 million people, and they oppose the publication of popular books. Because their minds contain anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist toxins, which have ideological roots and are by no means accidental.

	The Broad Masses Need Popular Reading Materials, But Zeng Yanxiu Says Booklets are "Flooding the Market"

	Song Jiaxiu of the People's Publishing House refuted Zeng Yanxiu's absurd statement that "academic works have basically stopped after liberation, and booklets are flooding the market." Song Jiaxiu said: Among our 600 million people, more than 500 million are workers and peasants, and a large part of them are illiterate, and the cultural level of those who are literate is not high. The Party wants to guide them to socialism, so of course it is necessary to especially focus on their political and ideological education and publish more popular and easy-to-understand books for them to read. Even the millions of intellectuals are all people who have come from the old society, and they all have their original set of ideas in their minds. The vast majority of them have never been exposed to Marxism-Leninism, and they have to learn from scratch. Should we rush to let Marxism-Leninism occupy the market and control the masses, or should we let bourgeois ideas flood the market? In the past few years, a considerable number of booklets have been published, and indeed some of them were not carefully selected, but there are many good popular reading materials among them. Many intellectuals admit that these books have played an undeniable role in raising the people's political awareness and ideological level. Regarding the issue of publishing academic works, Song Jiaxiu said that, taking the People's Publishing House alone, in addition to the classic works of Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, it has also published Hegel's Lectures on the History of Philosophy and the works of Aristotle, Feuerbach, Diderot, Rousseau, and others. The scale and richness of the reference materials for the history of Western philosophy that will be published soon are not only unprecedented in our country, but can also show its strengths among similar books published in various countries, and there are more than dozens or hundreds of other examples. Song Jiaxiu said that this proves that Zeng Yanxiu's statement is completely ignoring the facts.

	Lu Mu of the Workers' Publishing House, Zhu Zhongwen of the Popular Publishing House, and others listed facts to criticize Zeng Yanxiu's negation of the role of popular reading materials. At the same time, they questioned Zeng Yanxiu, why did he insist that no weighty academic works have been published since liberation? Are the classic works of Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong not considered weighty academic works? What does Zeng mean by weighty academic works?

	Zhang Mingyang, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the World Knowledge Press, said in his speech that the publishing work in the past eight years has made great achievements, and it is not "a complete mess" as Zeng Yanxiu said. Zeng Yanxiu should know what publishing has done after liberation. Why does he deny the achievements with his eyes closed? Because Zeng Yanxiu is essentially opposed to publishing books on Marxism-Leninism. The twelve-year long-term plan for the publishing industry stipulates that "the first thing is to publish Marxism-Leninism," and Zeng said, "Can we build our country solely on some dogmatic booklets?" Zhang Mingyang said that Zeng Yanxiu emphasized everywhere that the Party does not pay attention to publishing work, has no policy, and no leadership. He advocated running "partnership publishing houses" and "related publishing houses to find their own backstage bosses." Is this to strengthen the Party's leadership over the publishing industry? No one will believe it. The truth is that Zeng Yanxiu does not want the Party's leadership and wants to restore the so-called freedom of publishing under capitalism.

	Zeng Yanxiu Attempts to Overthrow the Publishing Policy and Let Bourgeois "Academic Works" Flood the Market

	Liang Chunfu, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the World Knowledge Press, said that it is not that Zeng Yanxiu did not know that the publishing industry had policies before the "double hundred" policy was put forward, but that he bitterly opposed these policies, negated these policies, and wanted to overthrow these policies. Specifically, he opposes the publishing policy of promoting Marxism-Leninism, serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and serving socialist economic and cultural construction. Liang Chunfu said that Zeng Yanxiu seems to highly praise the "double hundred" policy and believes that the publishing system should be considered on the basis of this policy. But in fact, Zeng Yanxiu's understanding of the policy is completely different from the policy put forward by the Party Central Committee. The Party's "double hundred" policy is based on promoting Marxism-Leninism, serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and serving socialism. Zeng Yanxiu's policy completely negates this foundation, and its purpose is to restore capitalist publishing freedom and let so-called bourgeois "academic works" flood the market.

	Zhao Shaohou, a veteran translator and editor of the People's Literature Publishing House, questioned Zeng Yanxiu at the meeting: What facts and statistics did you base your judgment on that we have published many third- and fourth-rate translated books since liberation, and not a single representative work has been translated. Zhao Shaohou said that if Zeng Yanxiu does not regard Aristophanes, Shakespeare, Moliere, Tolstoy, Pushkin, Dante, Goethe, Shelley, Dickens, Mark Twain, Tagore, etc. as third- and fourth-rate writers, then we have made considerable achievements in this area. For example, the twelve volumes of Shakespeare's Collected Plays have been distributed to 240,000 copies, and Moliere's plays have been published in nine types, and his multi-volume collection will be published soon. As for modern progressive writers such as Aragon and Steele of France, Jack Lindsay of England, Maltz of the United States, Amado of Brazil, Neruda of Chile, Hikmet of Turkey, etc., we have all published their works. Zhao Shaohou said: Due to the improvement of the ideological awareness and living conditions of translators, and more time to translate carefully, coupled with the serious processing of the editorial departments of various publishing houses, the quality of translation now is much higher than before liberation. What Zeng Yanxiu said that in the past few years we have only translated some booklets of foreigners' nonsense is really nonsense.

	Shen Peng, an editor of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, said that we have no common language with the rightist elements. The rightist elements say "it's terrible," and we say it's very good. Shen Peng refuted Zeng Yanxiu's fallacies that the publishing industry "has no leadership" and "is a complete mess" since liberation with the two completely different situations of the fine arts publishing industry before and after liberation. Shen Peng said that if "there is no leadership, the establishment of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, a national professional fine arts publishing institution, would be difficult to imagine. Shen Peng also cited the case of Beijing Rongbaozhai, which is famous at home and abroad for its woodblock watermark technology, being heavily in debt and almost closing down at the beginning of liberation, but after being changed to state-owned, its business has flourished, illustrating how this was achieved without leadership.

	Shen Peng said that the publishing work in the past few years has been led, directed, and achieved. Zeng Yanxiu either put on rightist glasses and couldn't see it, or deliberately pretended not to see it. But no matter what the reason, Zeng Yanxiu cannot deny that he has other intentions. He wants to smuggle in another set of "leadership" and "direction" to achieve another kind of achievement. Shen Peng said that if Zeng Yanxiu's set of reactionary program on the so-called "leadership" issue is realized, naturally there will be no "direction." Marxist-Leninist works can be dispensed with, popular reading materials that educate the working people with socialist ideas can be dispensed with, works translated from the Soviet Union can be dispensed with, advanced Soviet experience can not be learned, plans can not be made... Shen Peng said, look, what kind of "direction" does Zeng Yanxiu follow!

	Shi Gongxian of the People's Railway Publishing House refuted the fallacy of Zeng Yanxiu and other rightist elements negating the achievements of the publishing industry with facts. He pointed out that Zeng Yanxiu's statement that the Party "controls the regime" and "China will not perish if the publishing bureau is cut off" is really in the same tune as the reactionary remarks of Huang Shaohong, Chu Anping, and Ge Peiqi.

	Li Guojun of the Finance and Economics Publishing House, Fan Yong, Chen Jin, Deng Bucheng of the People's Publishing House, and Liu Zongbi of the Xinhua Map Publishing House also spoke at the meeting.

	Zeng Yanxiu spoke at the end of the symposium on the 17th. He said that he had been arrogant for a long time and did not study Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies and guidelines well, so he made mistakes. But he also said that he was only dissatisfied with the Party ideologically, not politically opposed to the Party.

	The meeting will continue to be held.

    否定出版事业的成绩  否定党对出版社的领导
    曾彦修追求资本主义的“出版自由”
    首都出版界召开座谈会揭露曾彦修的反动言论
    新华社17日讯  首都出版界15日和17日连续召开座谈会，揭露和驳斥曾彦修的反党、反社会主义的言行。出席座谈会的有出版界人士和几十个出版社的工作人员百余人。文化部副部长钱俊瑞、陈克寒、张致祥也出席了这一座谈会。在会上发言的有十四个人。
    彻底驳倒右派言论，才能改进出版工作
    文化部部长助理、出版事业管理局局长黄洛峰说明这次座谈会有两个内容，一是展开出版界的反右派斗争，一是进一步研究改进出版工作。他说：半年多来，特别是整风以后，文化界人士对出版工作提出了很多意见。其中绝大部分是好的，对改进出版工作有很大的帮助。有些工作，我们已在改进；有些关系重大的问题将提出方案同大家共同研究。黄洛峰说：但在整风中也有少数右派分子对出版工作进行了恶意的攻击，这中间，人民出版社副社长、共产党员曾彦修是代表人物之一。必须彻底驳倒右派言论，辨明大是大非，我们才可以在思想一致的基础之上，循着社会主义的道路，改进我们的工作。
    出版事业成绩巨大，右派分子不能抹煞
    老出版家舒新城以从事出版工作四十年的亲身经历和他看到的解放前后出版事业的变化驳斥右派分子关于出版事业“今不如昔”的反动论点。舒新城说：解放后出版事业的突出精神是为广大的人民服务，为社会主义服务，这和旧社会的出版事业，有着本质上的不同。旧社会的出版事业是维护统治阶级的利益的，虽然也有少数知识分子凭着“良心”在搞出版事业，但绝大多数是“唯利是图”的，搞“自由竞争”，还有不少皮包书店，偷印书稿，出黄色书，出一折八扣的乱七八糟的书，搞出版事业的甚至是不识字的人。解放以后，人民政府对私营出版业进行了社会主义改造，黄色书刊和投机书店逐步消灭；抢出同类书争夺市场的恶习也逐步改革了，政府对旧出版业的人员作了统一的安排，书刊定价标准逐步统一。几年来建立了许多专业出版社和地方出版社，书刊统一发行，使许多偏僻地区的读者也能买到书籍；另外还建立了历史上从来没有过的民族文字出版社，这些成就是很显著的。解放以前，反动政权对出版事业没有任何的“领导”，只有摧残，检查书稿，禁止发行，各地方也可以任意禁书、扣书，捕编辑，压经理，借故索诈更是司空见惯的事。我为了“扬州闲话”就被人控告，打官司，结果是送了十几部“四部备要”才了事。关于体制问题，舒新城说：人民出版事业的出版、印刷、发行分工是好的，这可以使各方面分别提高工作质量，满足广大人民的需要，也可以为国家节省大量人力和物资，执行中有些缺点是次要的。在旧中国的所谓出版、印刷、发行的三位一体制并不好，特别在解放后不适用了。那时所以如此，主要是为了对同行进行竞争，出书以“一本万利”为主，为学术目的出书是极少的；印刷方面常常为了利润而接收外件搁置书刊；自己不搞书店，没有地方可以发行。舒新城说：当然我们的出版工作还有可以改进的地方，我个人对出版工作也有些意见，但右派分子否定人民出版事业的巨大成绩，反对党的领导，主张恢复资本主义经营体制，都是错误的，我坚决反对。舒新城说：解放后我们增加了四千多万小学生，二千多万成人参加了扫盲学习，这六千多万人需要通俗小册子。党是看到了这些人的，所以我们出了很多对人民有益的通俗书籍，但右派分子看不见这六千万人，他们反对出版通俗书籍。因为他们的头脑中有反党、反人民、反社会主义的毒素，这是有思想根源的，绝不是偶然的。
    广大群众需要通俗读物，曾彦修却说小册子“泛滥市场”
    人民出版社的宋家修在会上驳斥了曾彦修的“解放后基本上停止了学术性著作，而让小册子泛滥于市场”的谰言。宋家修说：我们六亿人口中五亿多是工农群众，他们还有很大一部分不识字，识字的文化水平也不高，党要引导他们走向社会主义，当然要特别着重对他们的政治思想教育，多出些通俗易懂的书给他们读。就是几百万的知识分子吧，也都是旧社会的过来人，脑子里都有自己原来的一套，他们绝大多数人过去从没有接触过马列主义，他们要从头学习。我们还是应该赶紧让马列主义占领市场掌握群众呢，还是应该让资产阶级思想的东西泛滥于市场？过去几年所出相当大量的小册子中，确实有一部分选择不严，但其中好的通俗读物不在少数，很多知识分子都承认这些书籍对于提高人民的政治觉悟和思想水平方面起过不容否认的作用。关于出版学术著作的问题，宋家修说，仅就人民出版社而言，马列主义经典著作、毛泽东同志的著作以外，就出版了黑格尔哲学史讲演录和亚里斯多德、费尔巴哈、狄德罗、卢梭等人的著作。即将出版的西方哲学史参考资料的规模之巨大、内容之丰富，不仅我国过去所未有，就是放在各国所出的同类书中也能显出自己的长处，其他的例子何止数十百种。宋家修说，这证明曾彦修的说法完全是抹煞事实。
    工人出版社鲁牧，通俗出版社朱中文等列举事实，批驳曾彦修否定通俗读物的作用。同时质问曾彦修，为什么要硬说解放以来没有出版什么有分量的学术著作，难道马列主义的经典著作和毛泽东同志的著作算不得有分量的学术著作吗？曾所谓有分量的学术著作是指的什么？
    世界知识社副总编辑张明养在会上发言说，八年来的出版工作有很大成绩，完全不是如曾彦修所说的“一团糟”。解放后出版方面做了些什么工作，曾彦修应当说是知道的。他为什么要这样闭着眼否定成绩呢？因为曾彦修实质上是反对出马列主义的书。出版事业的十二年远景规划中规定“第一要出马列主义”，曾就说“难道我们单靠些教条主义小册子就能立国吗？”张明养说，曾彦修处处强调党对出版工作不重视，没有方针没有领导，他主张办“同人出版社”“有关的出版社各自找自己的后台老板”，难道这是要加强党对出版事业的领导吗？谁也不会相信。真象是：曾彦修不要党的领导，要恢复资本主义的所谓出版自由。
    曾彦修企图推翻出版事业方针，让资产阶级的“学术著作”泛滥
    世界知识出版社副总编辑梁纯夫说，曾彦修不是不知道在百家争鸣、百花齐放方针提出以前出版事业是有方针的，而是他深恶痛绝地反对这些方针，否定这些方针，要推翻这些方针。具体来说，就是他反对宣传马克思列宁主义、为工农兵服务、为社会主义经济、文化建设服务的出版方针。梁纯夫说，曾彦修好像非常赞扬“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，认为要在这个方针基础上来考虑出版制度。但事实上，曾彦修所了解的方针和党中央所提出的方针本质上是完全两样的。党的百家争鸣、百花齐放方针是建立在宣传马克思列宁主义、为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的基础上的。而曾彦修的方针却完全否定了这一基础，其目的在于恢复资本主义的出版自由，让所谓资产阶级“学术著作”泛滥。
    老翻译家、人民文学出版社编辑赵少候在会上质问曾彦修：究竟根据什么事实，什么统计，断定我们解放以来出了不少三四流的翻译书，有代表性的著作一本也不翻。赵少候说，如果曾彦修不是把阿里斯陀芬、莎士比亚、莫里哀、托尔斯泰、普式庚、但丁、歌德、雪莱、狄更斯、马克吐温、泰戈尔等当作三四流作家的话，那么我们在这方面是有了相当大的成绩的。如莎士比亚的戏剧集十二卷已发行到二十四万册，莫里哀的剧本已出到九种，不久就要出他的多卷集。至于现代的进步作家如法国的阿拉贡、斯梯、英国的杰克林赛、美国的马尔兹、巴西的亚马多、智利的聂鲁达、土耳其的希克梅特等等的著作，我们都出版了。赵少候说：由于翻译工作者思想觉悟的提高、生活条件的改善和有更多的时间可以细心翻译，再加以各出版社编辑部的认真加工，现在的翻译质量比解放前提高不少。曾彦修所说几年来只翻了些外国人胡说八道的小册子，这才是真正的胡说八道了。
    人民美术出版社编辑沈鹏说，我们和右派分子没有共同的语言。右派分子说“糟得很”，我们就说好得很。沈鹏以解放前后美术出版事业的两种迥然不同的景况，驳斥曾彦修所谓解放后出版事业“没有领导”“一团糟”等等谬论。沈鹏说，倘若“没有领导，人民美术出版社这样一个全国性的专业美术出版机构的成立就很难设想。沈鹏还举出以木版水印技术驰名国内外的北京荣宝斋在解放初负债累累，几乎倒闭，而从改为国营后，业务蒸蒸日上的事例，说明如果没有领导这又是怎样实现的呢？
    沈鹏说，几年来的出版工作是有领导、有方向、有成绩的。曾彦修或者是戴上了右派眼镜看不到，或者是故意装作看不见。但无论属于何种原因，曾彦修都不能否认他别有企图。他要偷运另外一套“领导”、“方向”，达到另外一种成绩。沈鹏说，曾彦修所谓“领导”问题的一套反动纲领如果实现，自然就不会“没有方向”了。马列主义著作可以不要，以社会主义思想教育劳动人民的通俗读物可以不要，从苏联翻译过来的著作可以不要，苏联的先进经验可以不学，计划可以不订……。沈鹏说，我们看，曾彦修遵循的是怎样的“方向”啊！
    人民铁道出版社的施公先以事实驳斥了曾彦修和其他右派分子否定出版事业成绩的谬论。他指出：曾彦修所说党“把持政权”“砍掉出版局中国不会亡”真是与黄绍竑、储安平、葛佩琦的反动言论异曲同工。
    在会上发言的还有财政经济出版社的李国钧，人民出版社的范用、陈今、邓步城和新华地图出版社的刘宗弼。
    曾彦修在17日座谈会结束时发了言。他说，他长期以来自高自大，对马克思列宁主义和党的方针政策不好好学习，以至犯了错误。但是他又说，他只是在思想上对党有不满，而不是政治上反对党。
    会议将继续举行。
