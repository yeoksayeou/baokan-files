Those Drawn into the Rightist Mire Should Act as Witnesses Exposing Rightist Conspiracies

    In his speech, Fei Xiaotong admitted that he had been exploited by Luo Longji for several years. He then exposed some of the conspiratorial activities of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji against the Party and socialism. He said:

    Two years ago, Zhang Bojun said everywhere: in the future, there will only be three kinds of people in society: workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and the democratic parties must become parties of intellectuals. From then on, the old grudges between Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun disappeared completely. Why was this? Dr. Luo Longji, who never submitted to anyone, was willing to be second-in-command and see eye-to-eye with Zhang Bojun. Why was this? He said it was because they had a common cause to pursue, to make a final struggle for the dying bourgeoisie. Their "concern" for intellectuals was to make intellectuals resist transformation, in order to preserve a glimmer of hope for the bourgeoisie.

    He said: Comrades who work in the League all know that Zhang and Luo never ask about how the League conducts its specific work. They are busy with their own affairs. But two years ago, when our Culture and Education Committee used the method of networking to discover problems among intellectuals, they intervened. They personally came forward to invite people with problems and those with grievances to seminars. Why was this? I am the one who initiated this networking method, and I am responsible.

    He said that they did have a policy. Their policy was: unite the backward, win over the middle, and strike at the progressive. This was not written down, but Zhang and Luo's words and deeds spelled out this policy. In their eyes, those who are ideologically backward and have grievances against the Party are the only decent people. He vigorously advocated absorbing backward elements into the League, with the aim of protecting their backwardness, arranging jobs and political positions for them, and making demands on the Party and the government on their behalf, in order to raise his status among these people.

    He said that Luo Longji's most hated people were the Party members in the League. He inquired behind their backs about who were Party members. He repeatedly asked whether Chu Tunan was a Party member. He attacked Deng Chumin. He publicized the shortcomings of progressive elements, causing intermediate elements to leave the progressive forces and be influenced by him.

    Next, Fei Xiaotong exposed some of Luo Longji's conspiratorial methods:

    First, using good names to do bad things, using the Party's policies to pull the rug out from under others. Luo often used what the Chairman said, what the Premier said to scare people. For example, using the idea that intellectuals are part of the working class to negate transformation, using conducting transformation through professional work to negate theoretical study, using the Hundred Schools of Thought to let loose anti-socialist remarks, using mutual supervision to engage in bourgeois democracy, and so on. Furthermore, using the opportunity of relaying instructions to distort the Party's instructions. His echoing of Zhang Bojun's relaying of the school Party committee system is a typical example.

    Second, using the shortcomings in the work of the Party and the government, exaggerating them to attack the Party's prestige and alienate the relationship between Party members and non-Party members. To give an example, there was a Tsinghua alumnus, Wang Shizhuo, who was allegedly criticized for several years for telling a joke. Luo Longji told me about this matter several times. This kind of example can arouse the sympathy of intellectuals with unstable stances. What was he gloating about?

    Third, using public speeches to provoke and attack the Party. He emphasized the issue of the relationship between Party members and non-Party members, placing the main responsibility on the Party member side. He used the individual case of a student studying abroad pulling a rickshaw to publicize it to the outside world. He was very concerned about the Culture and Education Committee's investigation of intellectuals, and specially selected some prominent examples to publicize them as speaking materials.

    Fourth, using others to take responsibility for him. He is most adept at using other people's erroneous remarks for propaganda. He used the fact that I said in a symposium that intellectuals have two lids (this statement itself is extremely wrong) and extended it, vividly describing it, and said that it was my invention. He also used my saying that "there are also Zhuge Liangs among intellectuals" once and extended it to "Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage," saying that it was the same as my meaning. He also did things this way. He said that "Contending [Zhengming] Monthly" had nothing to do with him, but in fact, I had attended a meeting once, and several of us opposed immediate public release, but he said that he had already signed a contract with the post office and there was no need to discuss it. He clearly instructed that the policy of "Contending" was to "say what others dare not say," but he said that he had never managed "Contending." He controlled Wenhui Bao, but he did not come forward himself, but went through Pu Xixiu.

    Fei Xiaotong also said: He has been trying very hard to win me over in the past two years. He wanted to use me to contact intellectuals. He used to be a famous miser, but why has he changed in the past two years? He took advantage of the fact that I lived in the suburbs and that it was inconvenient to eat and rest, and repeatedly invited me to his home for dinner and rest after meetings. During these times, he would promote his opinions to influence us and speak ill of progressive elements. I have heard a lot of bad things about Vice Chairman Shi Liang. If he is not engaged in factionalism, why does he slander comrades behind their backs? He most hates my association with Hu Yuzhi.

    He is afraid that others will see through his engagement in secret groups. At least in front of us, he is very careful to contact us separately, and he has said to me more than once that he will no longer engage in factionalism, and in order to avoid others speaking, he will no longer recommend anyone, saying that Zhang Zhihe's becoming a member of the CPPCC was not his doing, etc. In fact, he wanted to replace Chu Tunan with Zeng Zhaolun, and later used me to be the Minister of Culture and Education, squeezing out Chu Tunan. In the past two months, he also used Wenhui Bao to publish news about me several times, even fabricating rumors that one of my books was in eleven languages. This news came from Wenhui Bao. In the past two years, I have been deeply poisoned by him. I have already become a Rightist, what other ideas does he have, is he simply trying to get me somewhere? He specializes in discovering other people's shortcomings, using these shortcomings to serve him. This set of methods has been exposed today!

    Finally, Fei Xiaotong said: We, who have been drawn into the Rightist mire, are precisely the witnesses to expose their conspiracies. We must accuse their crimes and recognize our own mistakes. We repent and turn to the people. Think about it, if the Communist Party had not promptly exposed their conspiracy, how great a crime would we have committed!

    被拉入右派泥坑的人应该作揭发右派阴谋的见证人
    费孝通在发言中承认，几年来他被罗隆基所利用。接着他揭发了章伯钧、罗隆基进行反党反社会主义的一些阴谋活动。他说：
    两年前，章伯钧到处说：今后社会上只剩三种人了：工、农和知识分子，民主党派必须成为知识分子的政党。从此，罗隆基和章伯钧宿怨全消。这是为了什么？素来谁都不服的罗隆基博士却甘心屈居老二，和章伯钧一鼻孔出气，这又是为了什么？他说，这是因为他们有一件共同的大事要干，为垂死的资产阶级作最后的挣扎。他们“关心”知识分子是要知识分子抗拒改造，是为了要为资产阶级保留一线生机。
    他说：在盟内做工作的同志全都知道，章罗从来不过问盟怎样进行具体工作。他们忙着他们的事。但是两年前，我们文教委员会采用串联方法去发现知识分子问题时，他们却插手进来了。他们亲自出马，邀请有问题的人，有不满情绪的人来座谈，这又是为什么呢？创议这个串联方法的人，就是我，我是有责任的。
    他说，他们不是没有方针。他们的方针是：团结落后，争取中间，打击进步。这是没有见诸文字的，但章罗的言行写出了这个方针。在他们看来，思想落后的，对党有不满情绪的人才是正派人。他大力鼓吹要吸收落后分子入盟，目的是为了保护他们的落后性，为他们安排工作和政治地位，代表他们向党和政府提出要求，以提高他在这些人中的地位。
    他说，罗隆基最讨厌的是盟内的党员，他在背后打听谁是党员，他曾多次打听楚图南是不是党员。他打击邓初民。他宣传进步分子的缺点，使中间分子离开进步力量，受他的影响。
    接着，费孝通揭发了罗隆基进行阴谋的一些手法：
    第一，利用好名词做坏事，利用党的政策来偷天换日。罗经常用主席怎样说，总理怎样说来唬人。比如用知识分子是工人阶级来否定改造，用通过业务进行改造来否定理论学习，用百家争鸣来大放反社会主义的言论，用互相监督来搞资产阶级民主等等。更进一步，利用传达的机会来歪曲党的指示，他附和章伯钧关于学校党委制的传达就是一个典型例子。
    第二，利用党和政府工作上的缺点，加以夸大来打击党的威信，离间党和非党的关系。举一个例子，有个清华的校友，王士倬，据说是因为说了一句笑话，整了几年。这事罗隆基在我面前就讲了好几回，这种例子是会引起立场不稳的知识分子的同情的。他津津乐道，为的是什么？
    第三，利用公开发言，进行挑拨和向党进攻。他强调党和非党关系问题，把主要责任放在党员一方面。他用个别留学生拉车的事来向外宣传。他对于文教委员会关于知识分子的调查很关心，而且专门挑选一些突出的事例来宣传，作为发言资料。
    第四，利用别人来替他负责。他最善于利用别人的错误言论来作宣传。他用我在一次座谈会说了知识分子有两个盖子的话，（这话本身是极错误的）而加以引伸，绘形绘色，而说这是我的发明。又用我一次说“知识分子中也有诸葛亮”，又引伸到三顾茅庐，说是和我的意思相同。他做事也是这样。他把“争鸣月刊”说得和他毫无关系，而事实上，我曾参加过一次会，我们好几个人反对马上公开发行，而他说已经和邮局签订合同，不必讨论。他明明指示，“争鸣”的方针是“说人家不敢说的话”，而他却说他没有管过“争鸣”。他控制文汇报，但是却不自己出面，要通过浦熙修。
    费孝通还说：他这两年来，对我拉拢得很厉害。他想利用我去联系知识分子，他原是一个出名的吝啬鬼，但是这两年为什么变了？他利用我住在郊外，吃饭和休息不方便，多次开会完了邀我去他家里便饭和休息。在这些时间，他就宣传他的意见，来影响我们，说进步分子的坏话。我就听到过不少关于史良副主席的坏话。他不搞宗派，为什么要在背后毁谤同志呢？他最讨厌我和胡愈之来往。
    他怕别人识破他搞秘密团体，至少在我们面前他很小心地分别联系，而且在我面前不止一次说不再搞宗派了，而且为了免得别人说话，不再推荐任何人了，说张志和当政协委员并不是他搞的等等。事实上，他想把曾昭抡代替楚图南，后来又把我用来当文教部长，排挤楚图南。在过去二个月里，他还通过文汇报来几次发表关于我的消息，甚至造谣说我的一本书有十一国文字。这个消息是从文汇报来的。这两年我受他的毒害已经很深。我已经成了右派分子，他还在打什么主意，简直是要把我搞到什么地方去？他专门发现别人的缺点，利用这些缺点，来为他服务，这套手法在今天是都拆穿了！
    最后，费孝通说：我们这些已被他们拉入了右派泥坑的人，正是揭发他们阴谋的见证人。我们要控诉他们的罪恶，认识我们自己的错误。我们翻悔过来，投向人民。想一想，如果不是共产党及时地把他们的阴谋揭破，我们这些人将做下多大的罪恶！
