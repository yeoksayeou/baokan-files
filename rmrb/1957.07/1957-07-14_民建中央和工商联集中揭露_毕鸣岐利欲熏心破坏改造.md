Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA) and the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC) held two joint meetings on the 8th and 12th to focus on exposing and criticizing the reactionary words and deeds of the bourgeois rightist Bi Mingqi.

At these two meetings, more than 40 people spoke. Bi Mingqi also made two self-criticisms at the meetings. At the meeting on the 8th, the youth of the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles specially selected 14 representatives to expose Bi Mingqi's ugly words and deeds.

Zhu Jisheng, vice chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, said at the meeting on the 8th that Bi Mingqi was an extremely individualistic person filled with political ambition. When the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce was established in 1950, Bi was elected as one of the four vice chairmen, but he was very dissatisfied with being arranged as the fourth vice chairman according to the number of votes. Later, Li Zhinan, a representative of state-owned enterprises, voluntarily stepped down to fourth place so that Bi Mingqi could become the second, and only then was he satisfied. When the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CNDCA was reorganized last year, the original chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CNDCA, Li Zhuchen, could not serve in Tianjin due to heavy workload. Bi Mingqi saw this opportunity and advocated that the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal CNDCA and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should be unified, and he said to others, "I am the one who can truly represent the industrial and commercial circles." He attempted to elevate himself and win the trust of the industrial and commercial circles. The government once arranged for Bi Mingqi to be the manager of the Tianjin Animal Products Company, but he said the absurd remark that "being arranged as the manager of the Animal Products Company is equivalent to being unemployed." After the merger of all trades last year, the United Front Work Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce consulted many times and made proper arrangements for the work of industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin. When Bi Mingqi conveyed this arrangement, he did not mention the United Front Work Department at all, as if it was arranged by his own efforts alone, intentionally obliterating the care of the Party and the government for industrialists and businessmen. After the rectification campaign began this time, Bi Mingqi said to others that now it is our time to speak. He once asked Tang Baoxing to write an article in support of Zhang Naiqi's fallacy that the bourgeoisie no longer had a dual character.

Zhu Jisheng also accused Bi Mingqi of being accustomed to playing the two-faced trick of saying one thing in public and another in private. He said that when selling public bonds, Bi Mingqi appeared to be very active on the surface, but behind his back he said to others that "public bonds are sucking the blood of the industrial and commercial circles." Regarding fixed interest rates, Bi Mingqi said that if the government gave him 1,000 yuan per month according to his current standard of living, he could forgo the fixed interest. But when the fixed interest was set at five percent, he instigated others to come forward and propose that the fixed interest rate for enterprises opened after liberation should be higher than five percent, because his Xinmin Chemical Factory was opened after liberation.

Tian Yupou exposed that Bi Mingqi had consistently ignored the leadership of the Party. Once, someone criticized Bi Mingqi for not respecting the leading personnel of the Party Committee, and Bi Mingqi said, "The Federation of Industry and Commerce is independent, don't think too much about those."

Bi Mingqi's first empty self-criticism was criticized by the participants. Today, Bi Mingqi made a second self-criticism. He said that after graduating from a church school, he worked as a comprador in a foreign firm, helping imperialists exploit the Chinese people. Therefore, he has extreme individualism, a concept of fame and fortune, and vanity. Before liberation, he loved money. After liberation, especially after the merger of all trades, he attached great importance to reputation and status. His work was active on the surface, but in his bones he had serious selfish calculations; on the surface, he posed as a progressive element taking the socialist road, but in reality he was a hypocrite, a fake progressive, and his mind was filled with decadent capitalist ideas. The examples he listed in his self-criticism were mostly those that had already been exposed by everyone.

At the meeting, more than 30 people raised questions and criticisms to Bi Mingqi, asking him to explain the specifics, and also exposed many facts and asked Bi Mingqi to answer.

Wang Guangying said that at the beginning of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Bi Mingqi said to Li Zhuchen, "It is better for the industrial and commercial circles not to get involved in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, so as not to get burned." An industrialist in Tianjin volunteered to participate in land reform, but Bi Mingqi asked him to leave a note saying, "If anything happens, we can't be responsible." Wang Guangying asked Bi Mingqi what was the motive for saying these words? Why not make a self-criticism?

Tian Yupou revealed that after people from the industrial and commercial circles in Harbin criticized Bi Mingqi's fallacies at a forum held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, Bi said to him: "The Northeast was liberated early, the Communist Party controls it tightly, and the rule is strict, which does not reflect the real situation of the industrial and commercial circles." Tian Yupou asked Bi Mingqi to explain what was the intention of saying these words?

Che Chongyuan read a paragraph from an exposure material written by a staff member of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce at the meeting. This material said that after the CPC Central Committee issued instructions for rectification at the end of April, Bi believed that the time had come. On the one hand, he pretended to be progressive and said that the Federation of Industry and Commerce should also participate in the rectification; on the other hand, he ignited and incited the industrial and commercial circles. In early May, Bi inspected Tianjin as a representative of the National People's Congress and tried every means to instigate industrialists and businessmen to attack the Party. For example, when Zhang Ziheng, the private deputy director of the New Tianjin Dyeing Factory, and others proposed that the government should accelerate the abolition of private ownership, remove the "capitalist" labels from private personnel, and allow private personnel to join the trade union, Bi immediately expressed his support. He said: The label of capitalist is not suitable for you, I have always advocated removing the label for you, and I have made many proposals to the central government, but there has been no reply so far. He also said: I am also willing to remove the label, but the government insists on making me wear it. When Bi convened a meeting of private personnel in another factory, he said that the enthusiasm of the private personnel in your factory created more wealth than the workers, and they are stronger than the workers.

Liu Shizeng revealed that in April of this year, Bi asked Tian, a famous blind fortune teller in Tianjin, to tell his fortune. Tian said that Bi might become a minister this year. So Bi prepared to become a minister and promised others official positions.

Chen Shutong, Li Zhuchen, and many others spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that Bi Mingqi's self-criticism was very cunning. He answered one sentence for every sentence people said, talking about small things but not big things, talking about general things but not important things, defending himself on the one hand, and criticizing others on the other. He only admitted ideological problems and did not confess important facts. They also questioned Bi Mingqi what was the intention of "bringing the industrial and commercial circles in the Northwest and Southwest under control"? They asked Bi Mingqi to reflect deeply and promptly turn back after the meeting.

    民建中央和工商联集中揭露
    毕鸣岐利欲熏心破坏改造
    据新华社12日讯　民主建国会中央常委会和全国工商联常委会在8日和12日举行两次联席会议，集中地揭发和批判了资产阶级右派分子毕鸣岐的反动言行。
    在这两次会议上，共有四十多人发言，毕鸣岐也在会上作了两次检讨。在8日会议上，天津市工商界青年特地推选十四个代表前来揭发毕鸣岐的丑恶言行。
    天津市工商联副主任委员朱继圣在8日的会议上说，毕鸣岐是个充满着政治野心的极端个人主义者。1950年天津市工商联成立时，毕被选为四个副主任委员之一，但是他很不满意按票数多少安排为第四副主委，以后国营企业的代表李之楠自愿降为第四，由毕鸣岐当第二位，他才满足。去年民建天津市委改选的时候，原来民建天津市委的主任委员李烛尘因工作繁重，不能在天津任职，毕鸣岐看中了这个时机，就主张天津市民建和工商联的领导要一元化，并且对别人说：“我是真正能够代表工商界的。”企图抬高自己，博得工商界对他的信任。政府曾经安排毕鸣岐为天津市畜产公司经理，他却说出“安排为畜产公司经理等于失业”的怪话。去年全行业合营以后，中共天津市委统战部同天津市工商联多次协商，对天津市工商业者的工作作了妥善安排，毕鸣岐在传达这个安排意见的时候，只字不提统战部，仿佛是由他一人之力在安排的，有意地抹杀党和政府对工商业者的照顾。这次整风开始后，毕鸣岐对人说，现在是我们说话的时候了。他曾要唐宝兴写文章赞助章乃器的资产阶级已经没有两面性的谬论。
    朱继圣还指责毕鸣岐惯于玩弄明一套暗一套的两面派手法。他说，在推销公债的时候，毕鸣岐表面很积极，背地却对人说“公债是吸工商界的血”。对于定息，毕鸣岐说，如果政府按他目前的生活水准，每月给他一千元，他就可以不要定息。而当定息确定为五厘的时候，他又怂恿别人出面提出解放以后开设的企业定息应高于五厘，因为他的新民化工厂是在解放后开办的。
    田玉璞揭发毕鸣岐一贯漠视党的领导，有一次别人批评毕鸣岐不尊重党委领导人员，而毕鸣岐说：“工商联是独立的，不要过多地考虑那些。”
    毕鸣岐第一次的空洞的检讨，遭到与会者的批评。今天毕鸣岐作了第二次检查，他说，他在教会学校毕业以后，就在洋行当买办，帮助帝国主义者剥削中国人民，因此他有极端个人主义思想、名利观念和虚荣心。解放以前爱的是钱，在解放以后特别是全行业合营以后，名誉地位观念很重。他的工作表面上是积极的，但骨子里却有严重的自私自利的打算；表面上是以走社会主义道路的进步分子自居，实际是个假君子，假进步，脑子里装的是资本主义腐朽的思想。他在检查中列举的几个事例大都是大家已揭发的。
    在会上有三十多人向毕鸣岐提出质问和批评，要求他具体交代，还揭发许多事实要求毕鸣岐答复。
    王光英说，在抗美援朝开始的时候，毕鸣岐对李烛尘说，“抗美援朝，工商界还是不搞的好，免得惹火烧身”。天津市有位工商业者自愿去参加土地改革，而毕鸣岐要他留个字据，说“要是出了什么事，我们可负不了责任。”王光英问毕鸣岐说这些话的动机是什么？为什么不作检查？
    田玉璞揭露当哈尔滨工商界人士在中共中央统战部召开的座谈会上批判了毕鸣岐的谬论后，毕对他说：“东北解放得早，共产党控制得紧，统治的严，反映的不是工商界的真实情况。”田玉璞要毕鸣岐说明讲这些话的用意是什么？
    车重远在会上念了一段天津市工商联一位工作人员写的一份揭发材料。这个材料说，在4月底，中共中央发出整风指示后，毕认为时机已到，一面装出一副进步面孔，说工商联也要参加整风；一面在工商界中点火煽动。在5月初，毕以全国人民代表大会代表的身份在天津市视察，千方百计地煽动工商业者向党进攻。如在新天津染厂私方副厂长张子衡等提出政府应加速取消私有制，给私方人员摘帽子，吸收私方人员参加工会的时候，毕立即表示支持，他说：资本家的帽子戴在你们头上不合适，我一直主张给你们摘帽子，向中央提了好多次，可是到现在还没有答复。他还说：我也愿意摘帽子，可是政府非叫我戴着不可。毕在另外一个厂召集私方人员开会时说，你们厂的私方人员的积极性比工人创造的财富多，比工人强。
    刘士增揭发今年4月，毕找天津有名的田瞎子算命，田说，毕可能在今年当上部长。于是毕就做当部长的准备，并向别人许愿封官。
    陈叔通、李烛尘等许多人在会上讲了话，他们指出毕鸣岐的检讨很狡猾，人家说一句他答一句，说小不说大、谈一般不谈重要的，一面为自己辩解，一面又批评别人。只承认思想问题，不交代重要的事实。他们还责问毕鸣岐“要把西北、西南工商界抓过来”是什么企图？他们要求毕鸣岐在会后再深思猛省，及时回头。
