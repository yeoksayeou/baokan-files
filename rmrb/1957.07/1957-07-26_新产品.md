    New Products
    Giant Transformer
    This newspaper reports: A giant transformer capable of providing lighting for a city of two million people has recently been successfully manufactured at the Shenyang Transformer Factory.

    This is China's largest 20,000 kVA, 220,000-volt high-voltage giant power transformer. It can transmit electricity over a distance of more than 800 kilometers, capable of transmitting electricity from Shenyang to Beijing. It weighs 80 tons and is over five meters in height.
    Tubeless Tires
    This newspaper reports: Currently, ordinary tires cannot be used without inner tubes. However, the Tianjin Rubber Industry Research Institute has recently successfully trial-produced a type of tubeless tire. The main advantages of this tire are that it is resistant to punctures, easy to repair, simplifies the production process, and has a more stable internal pressure. At the same time, because there is no inner tube, internal friction is reduced, which can also extend the life of the tire.

    This type of tire has two layers of special rubber added: one is a sealing layer to prevent air leakage; the other is a self-sealing layer, which automatically seals the tire after it has been punctured by a nail.
    Five Types of High-Quality Steel Plates
    Xinhua News Agency reports: Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has successfully trial-produced five types of high-quality steel plates in the first half of this year, and they are already in mass production. Among these five types of high-quality steel plates are boiler steel plates and bridge steel plates, which are urgently needed for China's industrial construction. The boiler steel plate is specially used for manufacturing medium-pressure boilers and can withstand a pressure of 600 pounds per square centimeter. The bridge steel plate is not only suitable for building bridges in general areas, but can also guarantee that it will not be affected by the climate in cold places with temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.

    Boiler steel plates, etc., used to rely on imports. Now, imports can be gradually reduced, and many factories, mines, and construction departments can also receive timely supplies.
    Western Medicine for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 25: A new Western medicine product for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis—Cinchophen—has recently been officially put into production at the Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory, and the first batch of products has already been shipped.

    This drug is a white crystalline organic chemical synthetic agent, synthesized from a total of more than ten kinds of chemicals. Cinchophen has the effects of antipyretic, analgesic, and uric acid excretion and is currently a good medicine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

    In addition to manufacturing Cinchophen injections, the Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory will also manufacture a large number of oral Cinchophen tablets to facilitate the application of the drug by the vast number of farmers.

    Cinchophen is the first new product manufactured by China's pharmaceutical industry, and the Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory is also currently the only factory in China producing Cinchophen. In the past, the Cinchophen used in Chinese medicine was all imported. This year, the quantity of Cinchophen produced by the Xi'an Pharmaceutical Factory is equivalent to half of the national import volume; after the new equipment capacity of this factory is brought into play next year, the production quantity will be more than ten tons more than the national demand, and it can be supplied for export.

    新产品
    巨大的变压器
    本报讯　一台能够供二百万人口的城市照明用的巨型变压器，最近在沈阳变压器厂制造成功。
    这是我国最大的一台二万千伏安二十二万伏高电压的巨型电力变压器。送电距离可达八百多公里，从沈阳能送电到北京。体重八十吨。高度在五公尺以上。
    没有内胎的轮胎
    本报讯　目前一般的轮胎离开内胎就不能使用。天津橡胶工业科学研究所最近却试制成功了一种没有内胎的轮胎。这种轮胎的主要优点是不怕刺伤，补胎方便，生产工序简化，内压比较稳定。同时，由于没有内胎，减少了内部的摩擦，还可以延长轮胎的寿命。
    这种轮胎里增贴了两层特殊胶料：一层是密封层，防止漏气；另一层是自封层，它的功用是在轮胎被钉子刺穿以后能自动封合。
    五种优质钢钢板
    据新华社讯　重庆钢铁公司今年上半年试制成功了五种优质钢钢板，并且已经大批生产。这五种优质钢钢板中，有我国工业建设迫切需要的锅炉钢板和桥梁钢板。锅炉钢板是专门制造中压锅炉用的，它每平方公分能承受六百磅的压力。桥梁钢板，不仅适合在一般地区建设桥梁用，在摄氏零下二十度的寒冷地方也能保证不受气候影响。
    锅炉钢板等，过去是依靠进口的物资，现在就可以逐渐减少进口，许多厂矿和建设部门也可以得到及时供应。
    治疗风湿性关节炎的西药
    据新华社西安25日电　一种治疗风湿性关节炎的西药新产品——辛可芬，最近在西安制药厂正式投入生产，第一批产品已经出厂。
    这种药物是白色结晶的有机化学合成剂，共用十几种化学物合成。辛可芬有退热、止痛和排泄尿酸等效能，是目前治疗风湿性关节炎的良药。
    西安制药厂现在除了制造辛可芬注射剂以外，为照顾广大农民应用时的便利，还将大量制造口服辛可芬药片。
    辛可芬是我国制药工业第一次制造的新产品，西安制药厂也是我国目前唯一生产辛可芬的工厂。过去，我国医药上用的辛可芬都是进口货。今年，西安制药厂生产的辛可芬数量，相当全国进口量的一半；明年这座工厂的新建设备能力发挥以后，生产的数量要比全国需要量多十吨以上，可以供应出口。
