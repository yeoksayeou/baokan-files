Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: At the joint meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association held today, Rong Yiren, Sheng Pihua, Liu Jingji, Xiang De, Huang Changshui, Deng Jixing and other six people examined their erroneous speeches and bourgeois stance and thoughts in helping the Communist Party in the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, and launched mutual criticism.

    In the afternoon, bourgeois rightist Qian Sunqing also made an account at the meeting.

    Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, spoke first. Through some specific examples, he examined that due to his strong bourgeois stand and viewpoints, he had produced many actions that were divorced from the leadership of the Party and unfavorable to socialism.

    Rong Yiren examines that he sympathized with Zhang Naiqi's remarks, expanded the contradiction between the Party and the industrial and commercial circles, and now he has awakened.

    Rong Yiren first examined that at the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association last year, when everyone launched a struggle with Zhang Naiqi on the two-sidedness of the national bourgeoisie and other issues, he was confused by Zhang Naiqi's statement that there were factions within the association, and believed that he should stay out of it. He did not approve of others criticizing Zhang Naiqi by name, thinking it was a personal attack. When several comrades of the China Democratic National Construction Association invited him to reason with Zhang Naiqi in order to unite and win him over, Zhang Naiqi put forward the absurd statement that "the Chinese national bourgeoisie is a revolutionary class," but at that time he said, "the Chinese national bourgeoisie has a revolutionary side and a non-revolutionary side." He said that because he emphasized that the national bourgeoisie has a patriotic side, and then affirmed its "love for socialism" from patriotism, he did not understand that without the education of the Party and without socialist transformation, the national bourgeoisie could not love socialism. He said, "My view shows that I have strong bourgeois feelings and a bourgeois stand. This stand is on the common ground with Zhang Naiqi. Therefore, in that struggle, I not only did not become an aid, but actually became an obstacle to the struggle."

    Rong Yiren then examined the incident in May this year when he raised the issue of the public representative of the Simingtang Pharmacy wounding the private manager at the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Work Conference. He said that it was okay to raise this matter, but because his stand and viewpoint were wrong, he exaggerated such individual problems and made a big deal out of a small issue. Under the grand principle of "to promote democracy, we must safeguard the rule of law," he pointed out this matter and "cornered" Ke Qingshi, the First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and Xu Jianguo, the Deputy Mayor, demanding that they immediately deal with this problem. He said: "Because of my speech, it has produced a very bad influence, expanded the contradiction between the industrial and commercial circles and the Party and the government, and in effect, it helped the industrial and commercial circles with ‘counterproductive assistance’."

    Rong Yiren also examined that he had personal prejudices and attacked activists in the industrial and commercial circles based on personal preferences, etc.

    Rong Yiren went on to talk about how, due to his serious bourgeois feelings and stance, the rightist Zhang Naiqi had carried out various activities to win him over and win him over.

    He said that when Zhang Naiqi came to Shanghai for inspection last year, he asked the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association to invite him to a symposium. Zhang Naiqi made a long reactionary speech at the meeting, encouraging the industrial and commercial circles to "raise their heads," saying that the industrial and commercial circles had not "raised their heads" after the overall industry joint venture. At that meeting, Zhang Naiqi also viciously slandered and attacked the leadership of the Party under the guise of opposing dogmatism and sectarianism. He wanted to seize Shanghai, the city with the most concentrated private industry and commerce, as his "political capital" to attack the Party. Rong Yiren said that Zhang Naiqi's activities in Shanghai that time found a "market" and won "applause," leaving a very bad influence in the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles. As a result, after the China Democratic National Construction Association made a resolution on Zhang's issue at the Second Plenary Session, the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles did not pay attention to the discussion of this resolution, and neither did he himself.

    Rong Yiren also revealed that when the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held in March this year, Zhang Naiqi said to him during the break, "The Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association should be re-evaluated and checked." One evening during the meeting, Zhang Naiqi first went to see Hu Juewen and then went to see him, and talked to him about how fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income; two-sidedness exists in all classes; and that remoulding is idealism, a "supernatural" and "skinning" series of fallacies. Rong Yiren said, "Why did Zhang Naiqi talk to me about these issues at that time? Today, it seems that he was looking for a market for his reactionary arguments, especially finding Hu Juewen first and then coming to me, which shows that he attempted to find 'supporters' and 'fellow travelers' in the leadership of the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles. Combining his evil activities in Shanghai last year and his 'lobbying' with me, it shows that he wanted to lay the foundation first, then pull up the upper level, and grasp the upper level before developing the foundation. The ultimate goal is to seize the opportunity to attack the Party and socialism."

    Rong Yiren said: "Due to my strong bourgeois feelings, I had something in common with Zhang Naiqi, and I also thought he was knowledgeable. I unknowingly helped him in his activities. I talked to the responsible comrades of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association several times. He has 'talent' and we should unite with him. I forgot that only on the basis of socialism can we unite. How can we talk about uniting with an anti-Party and anti-people rightist?"

    Rong Yiren said: "Now I have awakened. I must resolutely exercise myself in the anti-Rightist struggle. I thank the Party for shouting loudly at me at the critical moment, so that I can wake up and turn back, so as not to leave the bright road of socialism." Rong Yiren also expressed his gratitude to the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce for their criticism and help.

    Sheng Pihua said: People like us are prone to have sentimentalism in the struggle, which is not conducive to the struggle.

    Sheng Pihua, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Association and Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, made a self-criticism at the meeting. He said: "The anti-Rightist struggle can also educate oneself. I have a deep understanding of this. I remember the night before the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association last year, the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association launched a struggle against Zhang Naiqi's issue on the two-sidedness of the national bourgeoisie. During the discussion, I thought that the national bourgeoisie had two sides, but when the draft resolution was put to a vote, I did not raise my hand." At the industrial and commercial symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, I once said in my speech: "I think the industrial and commercial circles have two sides, but I don't object if others say they don't." I know this sentence is wrong, so I proposed to withdraw it at the joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce.

    Sheng Pihua said: "In this anti-Rightist struggle, comrades have criticized me for not raising my hand when voting on the issue of two-sidedness in the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association last year. At first, I felt that this was a misunderstanding of me by my comrades. But after constant mutual enlightenment in the anti-Rightist struggle and in-depth analysis, I realized that although I thought that the national bourgeoisie still had two sides after the high tide of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, I did not raise this issue to the principled status of accepting transformation by the industrial and commercial circles. Therefore, in this year's speech, I would say 'I think there are two sides, but I don't object if others say there are not,' and I would not raise my hand when voting last year. This shows that I am sometimes vague about standing firm on the socialist stand. Without this anti-Rightist struggle, it would not be possible for me to have such a deep understanding of the importance of such a principled issue."

    Sheng Pihua finally said: "It is not easy to stand firm on the socialist stand. The anti-Rightist struggle is not only to crush the reactionary conspiracy of the rightists, but also a good exercise for us to stand firm on the socialist stand. People like us are prone to sentimentalism in the struggle, which is not conducive to the struggle. This deserves our vigilance."

    Liu Jingji, Xiang De, Huang Changshui, and Deng Jixing said that they should disinfect themselves and step up self-transformation.

    Liu Jingji, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, examined himself and said: This struggle against the rightists has given me an extremely profound socialist education. I want to use this education to play a disinfecting role in myself, and use the rightists as a mirror to reflect myself.

    Liu Jingji examined five facts and believed that some of his past erroneous remarks were in the same vein as the fallacies of rightists such as Zhang Naiqi. For example, in March this year, at the National Political Consultative Conference, he suggested that in enterprises with conditions, if there are also private personnel with certain conditions, he hoped that the state would provide more training and that public representatives could be dispensed with, and that these private representatives would be responsible for the administrative leadership of the entire factory under the leadership of the enterprise Party committee and professional companies. He said that although this argument went around in circles, its purpose was still not to have public representatives, which was as absurd as the rightists' demand to withdraw public representatives. For example, he repeatedly emphasized that after the industrial and commercial circles handed over the means of production, especially after the implementation of fixed interest, the relationship between capitalists and the means of production has undergone fundamental changes, and the state should provide more training for private personnel so that they can be trained in major responsibilities, and that not sending public representatives is a good opportunity to better train and exercise private personnel. He also repeatedly emphasized promoting workers as administrative leaders as much as possible. In fact, the promotion of workers is treated as guests of the private personnel, and the working people are still looked down upon.

    Liu Jingji revealed that at the beginning of the liberation, when he was engaged in labor-capital relations work in Shanghai, Zhang Naiqi once said to him that the current labor-capital antagonism is like a book. In the past, it was rolled too far to the right and could not be flattened. Now the workers are suppressing you capitalists, which is equivalent to rolling the book to the left and holding it in your hand. He also revealed that Lin Diffei, one of the members of Zhang Naiqi's small group in the China Democratic National Construction Association, attempted to win him over and anesthetize and provoke him and the national capitalists at the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

    Xiang De, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, examined his erroneous remarks at the Hunan Provincial Political Consultative Conference in May this year. The topic of his speech at that time was: "What is hindering the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen?" In his speech, he said that the sectarianism of Party members was quite serious, that "Party members are good at being officials," and that some units emphasized class relations in public-private relations, looking at people with class prejudices; that the government did not care about the suffering of private personnel, etc.; but he did not mention a word about strengthening self-education and self-transformation for industrialists and businessmen. Xiang De said that these remarks fueled the dissatisfaction of industrialists and businessmen with the Party and the government, causing them to leave the Party and the government; instead of strengthening the self-transformation of industrialists and businessmen, they relaxed the self-transformation of industrialists and businessmen.

    Xiang De examined his erroneous thoughts and said: At the beginning of "blooming" and "contending," I had strong bourgeois feelings. As soon as I heard about the difficulties of private personnel, I used them as speech materials without analysis. I did not consider whether it would affect the development of the negative side of private personnel. My mistake this time was a mistake of stand. Xiang De said that he would first disinfect himself, remove corruption and generate muscle, and draw a clear line with the rightists.

    Huang Changshui believes that his mistake is mainly that he verbally supports the Party and socialism, but forgets it when he encounters specific problems. He said that at a symposium of responsible persons of various democratic parties convened by the United Front Work Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC on May 17, he said that small enterprises generally have Party branches, public representatives, trade unions, and Communist Youth League branches, and there are too many levels, which is not conducive to work. He hoped that the Municipal Committee would consider whether to set up Party branches in some small enterprises that do not meet certain conditions. He said that he now realizes that this statement is wrong and a manifestation of insufficient attention to and reliance on the Party. He acted as a spokesperson for the rightists. He said that he will strengthen transformation in the future, completely eliminate bourgeois ideology, and always follow the Communist Party.

    Deng Jixing today examined her proposal to the government to issue "nationalization bonds for joint state-private enterprises" at the industrial and commercial symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. This proposal was to have the government issue a kind of bond to the capitalists, recover the private shares, and then change the joint venture enterprises into state-owned enterprises. She said that this proposal was wrong and has applied to the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee to withdraw it.

    Deng Jixing examined that the reason why she put forward this proposal was that she mistakenly believed that the class contradictions in the joint venture enterprises after the overall industry joint venture were mainly due to the existence of the fixed interest system, and that she did not realize that it was because exploitation still existed and class relations still existed.

    Deng Jixing also criticized her statement that "fixed interest is different from the profits generated by private ownership, because fixed interest is paid even if individual enterprises have no surplus."

    Deng Jixing said that for eight years, she has been a member of the Propaganda and Education Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association. She had more meetings with Zhang Naiqi and was deeply poisoned by him, so she resonated with Zhang Naiqi's fallacies. Deng Jixing did not seriously examine her own erroneous words and deeds.

    After examining herself, Deng Jixing also revealed a few things about Zhang Naiqi. She said that in August last year, Pu Xixiu lived at Luo Longji's place in Beidaihe and saw Zhang Naiqi often talking to Luo Longji secretly at night. What exactly did he discuss with Luo Longji? Deng Jixing also said that Zhang Naiqi once said that if the political power were to rotate and it was the turn of the China Democratic National Construction Association, he would definitely be framed. He should explain the method of "rotation of political power" and whether he conspired with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji.

    Also speaking today were Gong Tianmin, Jing Shuping, Hu Ziying, Tang Di Yin, Wang Guangying, Huang Yanpei, and Chen Shutong.

    Huang Yanpei said that he hoped that everyone would continue to help those who have made mistakes correct their mistakes with the attitude of treating illnesses and saving people, and that those who have made erroneous remarks should honestly examine themselves.

    Chen Shutong said: We have all spent decades in the old society, and old ideas are deeply rooted. At the same time, taking the socialist road is an earth-shaking change and not an easy task. Therefore, don't lose confidence because you have made mistakes. If you turn back after making mistakes, you can still embark on the bright road of socialism.

    Rightist Qian Sunqing said in his account, "I have embarked on the road of anti-socialism."

    After the above-mentioned people spoke, Qian Sunqing, a bourgeois rightist who was severely criticized by the people from all walks of life in Jiangsu, then accounted for his reactionary words and deeds.

    Qian Sunqing initially affirmed that his past words and deeds were consistently reactionary and had brought very bad influences and harms to the Party and the people and had embarked on the road of anti-socialism.

    Qian Sunqing said that since liberation, although he has also participated in various major movements, he has only coped with them. Emotionally and ideologically, he still resisted transformation. Today's examination shows that he represents only a small number of feudal landlords and backward industrial and commercial interests. For example, in the land reform movement, he had absurd views such as "Southern Jiangsu does not have big landlords, which is different from Northern Jiangsu" and "Is the land reform movement too excessive?" In the "Five Antis" movement, he cried out for the unjust treatment of arrested profiteers; in the "Suppress Counterrevolutionaries" and "Eliminate Counterrevolutionaries" movements, he was dissatisfied with these movements when he saw acquaintances being suppressed. The most prominent thing was to cry out for the unjust treatment of traitors Qian Fenggao, profiteer Zhao Zhangji, and Zhang Renshan. Recently, in the "blooming" and "contending," he still spread anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies and attacked the Party and the government. Qian Sunqing said that all of this proves that his reactionary thoughts are very intense, to the point of being a spokesperson for reactionary elements, landlords, and profiteers. Qian Sunqing also said that after returning to Jiangsu, he would continue to accept the help of the masses and thoroughly account for his problems.

    Then, Leng Yu, Liu Guojun, and Li Wenjie criticized Qian Sunqing for not only having extremely despicable bourgeois thoughts but also extremely reactionary feudal landlord thoughts.

    Li Zhuchen, the chairman of the meeting, earnestly advised Qian Sunqing to deeply examine himself after returning to Jiangsu and not to cut himself off from the people.

    工商界要在反右派斗争中继续改造
    荣毅仁、盛丕华、刘靖基、向德、黄长水、邓季惺检查自己的错误
    据新华社19日讯  在今天举行的全国工商联和民建中央常委联席会议上，荣毅仁、盛丕华、刘靖基、向德、黄长水、邓季惺等六人对自己这次在帮助共产党整风和反右派斗争中的错误言论以及资产阶级立场和思想进行检查，并展开相互批评。
    下午，资产阶级右派分子钱孙卿也在会上作了交代。
    全国工商联副主任委员、上海市工商联副主任委员荣毅仁首先发言，他通过一些具体事例，检查了自己由于存在着浓厚的资产阶级立场、观点，以致产生了许多脱离党的领导和不利于社会主义的行动。
    荣毅仁检讨他同情过章乃器的言论，扩大了党同工商界的矛盾，现在清醒过来了
    荣毅仁首先检查了他在去年民建二中全会时，大家与章乃器为对民族资产阶级的两面性等问题展开斗争时，他为章乃器提出的会内有宗派的说法所迷惑，认为自己应该置身事外，对于别人指名道姓地批判章乃器，心里就不以为然，认为这是人身攻击。当民建几位同志为了团结争取章乃器邀他一起去和章乃器说理时，章乃器又向他们提出了“中国民族资产阶级是革命的阶级”的荒谬言论，而当时他却说，“中国民族资产阶级有革命的一面也有不革命的一面”。他说，由于他强调了民族资产阶级有爱国的一面，再从爱国来肯定它“爱社会主义”，而没有了解没有党的教育，不经过社会主义改造，民族资产阶级是不可能爱社会主义的。他说，“我的这种看法，说明我有浓厚的资产阶级感情和资产阶级立场，这个立场是站在和章乃器共同之处的，因此在那场斗争中，我不仅没有成为助力，实际成为斗争中的阻力”。
    荣毅仁接着检查了今年5月他在中共上海市委宣传工作会议上提出四明堂药局公方代表刀伤私方经理的事件。他说，这件事提出是可以的，但是由于他的立场观点不对，把这样的个别问题夸张了，用小题目做大文章，他在“要发扬民主必须要维护法纪”的大原则下指出这件事，并且“将”了中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施、副市长许建国的“军”，要求他们立即处理这个问题。他说：“由于我的这个发言，产生了很坏的影响，扩大了工商界同党与政府的矛盾，在效果上是为工商界帮了‘倒忙’。”
    荣毅仁还检查了他存在着个人偏见，从个人喜爱出发以致打击了工商界的积极分子等等错误。
    荣毅仁接着谈到由于他的严重的资产阶级感情和立场，右派分子章乃器曾对他进行种种争取、拉拢活动。
    他说，章乃器去年到上海视察时，要求上海市工商联和民建会为他邀集一个座谈会。章乃器在会上发表了长篇反动言论，鼓励工商界“抬起头来”，说工商界在全行业合营后还没有“抬头”，在那个会上章乃器还以反对教条主义、宗派主义为幌子来恶毒地污蔑和攻击党的领导，他想把上海这个私营工商业最集中的城市抓在手里，作为他的“政治资本”来向党进攻。荣毅仁说，章乃器那次在上海的活动是找到了“市场”博得了“掌声”的，在上海工商界中留下了很坏的影响，以致在民建二中全会关于章的问题，作出决议后，上海工商界对这个决议的讨论是不重视，他自己也是如此。
    荣毅仁还揭露在今年3月全国人民政协举行全体委员会时，章乃器在休息时对他说，“民建二中全会应重新估价，加以检查。”会议期间的有一天晚上，章乃器先去看了胡厥文然后又去看他，和他谈到定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获；两面性是各个阶级都存在的；脱胎换骨是唯心主义，是“超凡入圣”“抽筋剥皮”等一系列谬论。荣毅仁说，“章乃器为什么那时找我谈这些问题呢？今天看来他是在为他的反动论点找市场，特别是先找胡厥文再来找我，这说明他企图在上海工商界的领导层中找寻‘支持者’和‘同路人’，结合他去年在上海的罪恶活动及向我的‘游说’，说明他想先铺底子后拉上层，抓牢上层再发展基础，而最终目的就是伺机而发，向党、向社会主义进攻”。
    荣毅仁说：“由于我的浓厚的资产阶级感情，和章乃器有了共同之处，还认为他是有学问的，不知不觉地帮助他活动，我曾经好几次和民建中央负责同志谈，他有‘才干’，要团结他，我忘记了只有在社会主义基础上才能团结，和一个反党、反人民的右派分子那里谈得上团结呢？”
    荣毅仁说：“现在我清醒过来了，我要坚决在反右派斗争中锻炼自己，感谢党在我危险关头向我大喝一声，使我能猛醒回头，不致离开了社会主义的康庄大道。”荣毅仁还表示感谢民建和工商联对他的批评和帮助。
    盛丕华说：像我们这样的人，在斗争中容易有温情主义，这对斗争是不利的
    民建会中央常委会副主委、上海市工商联主任委员盛丕华在会上作了自我批评。他说：“在反右派斗争中同时也是能够教育自己的，这一点我的体会是很深的。记得去年民建会召开二中全会的前夜，在民建中央常务委员会上对章乃器的关于民族资产阶级两面性问题，展开了斗争，在讨论中我是认为民族资产阶级有两面性的，但当决议草案提付表决的时候，我没有举手”。这次中共中央统战部召开的工商座谈会上，在我发言中曾经谈到：“我认为工商界是有两面性的，但别人说没有，我也不反对。”这一句话我知道错了，所以在民建会和工商联的常务委员联席会议上提出收回了。
    盛丕华说：“在这次反右派斗争中，曾经有同志对我去年民建会中常委表决两面性问题时没有举手，提出了批评。起初我觉得这是同志们对我的误解。但经过反右派斗争中不断的互相启发，自己也深入分析，我才认识到虽然认为民族资产阶级在私营工商业改造高潮之后还存在两面性，但我并没有将这一问题提高到有关工商界接受改造的原则性地位来认识，因此在今年的发言中才会有‘我认为有两面性，别人说没有，我也不反对’的说法，才会在去年表决时不举手。这说明我对于站稳社会主义立场，有时也是会模糊的。如果没有这一次反右派斗争，对于这样一个原则性问题的重要性，不可能使我有如此深刻的认识。”
    盛丕华最后说：“站稳社会主义立场，并不是很容易的。反右派斗争，不仅是为了粉碎右派分子的反动阴谋，也是我们自己站稳社会主义立场很好的锻炼。我们这样的人，在斗争中容易有温情主义，这对斗争是不利的。这一点值得我们警惕”。
    刘靖基、向德、黄长水、邓季惺表示要在自己身上消毒，加紧自我改造
    民建上海市委员会副主委刘靖基检讨说：这次反右派分子的斗争，使我受到了一次无比深刻的社会主义教育。我要把这次教育在我身上起消毒作用，把右派分子作为镜子，照一照自己。
    刘靖基检查了五点事实，认为自己过去的一些错误言论，与章乃器等右派分子的谬论一脉相通。如今年3月，他在全国政协会议上建议，在有条件的企业中，如果又有一定条件的私方人员，希望国家多加培养，可以不必派公方代表，即由这些私方代表，在企业党委和专业公司的领导下，担当全厂行政领导工作。他说，这个论调虽然兜了个圈子，其目的也还是不要公方代表，和右派分子要求撤出公方代表的主张，同样是荒谬的。再如他一再强调，工商界生产资料交出后，特别是实行定息后，资本家和生产资料的关系已发生根本变化，国家应对私方人员多加培养，使他们能在重大责任中得到锻炼，并认为不派公方代表就是对私方人员更好地培养、锻炼的好机会。他还一再强调尽量提拔职工为行政领导。而实际上是把提升职工作为私方人员的陪客，还是看不起劳动人民。
    刘靖基揭发，解放初期，他在上海搞劳资关系的工作的时候，章乃器曾对他说，现在劳资对立，等于一本书，过去向右卷得太多了，一直放不平；现在工人把你们资本家压下来，等于把书向左卷，捏在手上。他还揭发了章乃器在民建会内的小集团成员之一林涤非，在民建会二中全会上企图拉拢他和民族资本家进行麻醉、挑拨的事实。
    湖南省工商业联合会主任委员向德检讨了今年5月他在湖南省政治协商会上的错误言论。他那次发言的题目是：“是什么阻碍了工商业者积极性的发挥？”他在发言中说，党员的宗派主义相当严重，“党员好做官”以及有些单位在公私关系中强调阶级关系，以阶级成见看人；政府不关心私方人员疾苦等；而对工商业者应加强自我教育、自我改造，一句未提。向德说，这些言论，助长了工商业者对党和政府的不满情绪，使他们离开党和政府；不是加强工商业者的自我改造，而是放松工商业者的自我改造。
    向德检查自己的错误思想说：“鸣”“放”开始时，我有浓厚的资产阶级感情，一听到私方人员如何困难的话，即不加分析，作为发言资料。没有考虑是否影响到私方人员消极一面的发展。我这次的错误，是立场的错误。向德表示要先在自己身上消毒，去腐生肌，和右派分子划清界限。
    黄长水认为自己的错误，主要是口头上拥护党拥护社会主义，但碰到具体问题就忘掉了。他说他在5月17日中共广州市委会统战部召开的各民主党派负责人座谈会上，曾说一般小型企业有了党支部、公方代表、工会、团支部，又有生产管理委员会，层次太多，对工作不利，希望市委会考虑对某些条件不够的小型企业是否都要设立党支部。他说他现在认识到这种提法是错误的，是对党重视和依靠不够的一种表现。做了右派分子的代言人。他表示今后要加强改造，彻底清除资产阶级思想，永远跟着共产党走。
    邓季惺今天就她在中共中央统战部召开的工商界座谈会上，向政府提出发行“公私合营企业国有化公债”的建议，进行检查。这个建议就是要政府发行一种公债给资本家，把私股股票收回，然后把合营企业改为国营。她说，这个建议是错误的，已经向中共中央统战部申请撤销。
    邓季惺检查她之所以提出这个建议，是错误地认为全行业合营以后，合营企业中存在阶级矛盾主要是由于定息制度还存在的原故，而没有认识到是由于剥削还存在，阶级关系还存在。
    邓季惺还批判了她的“定息与私有制产生的利润不同，因为个别企业没有盈余也支付定息”的说法。
    邓季惺说，八年来担任民建中央常委会宣教委员会委员，同章乃器在一起开会的时候比较多，中了他的毒素比较深，因此同章乃器的谬论起了共鸣。邓季惺对她自己的错误言行并没有认真检讨。
    邓季惺在检查自己以后，还揭发了章乃器几件事。她说，去年8月浦熙修到北戴河住在罗隆基处，看见章乃器常常在夜间找罗隆基密谈，究竟同罗隆基商量了些什么？邓季惺还说章乃器曾经说，如果政权轮庄，轮到民建时，他一定会被陷害。他应该交代“政权轮庄”的办法，是否同章伯钧、罗隆基密谋过？
    今天发言的还有巩天民、经叔平、胡子婴、汤蒂因、王光英、黄炎培、陈叔通等人。
    黄炎培说，希望大家继续以治病救人的态度帮助犯了错误的人改正错误，发表了错误言论的人应该老老实实地检查。
    陈叔通说：我们都是在旧社会过了几十年的人，旧的思想根深蒂固，同时走社会主义道路是个翻天复地的变革，并不是很容易的事，因此不要因为犯了错误就失去信心，犯了错误自己回头，还是可以走上社会主义的光明大道。
    右派分子钱孙卿在交代中说“我走上了反社会主义的道路”
    在上述人士发言以后，受到江苏各界人民严厉批判的资产阶级右派分子钱孙卿，接着对自己的反动言行作了交代。
    钱孙卿一开始就肯定自己过去的言行是一贯反动的，对于党和人民带来了很坏的影响和危害，已经走上了反社会主义的道路。
    钱孙卿说，解放以后，他虽然也参加了历次大运动，但都是应付过关，在情绪上和思想上还是抗拒改造的。今天检查，自己所代表的只是一小撮封建地主和落后工商界的不法利益。如在土地改革运动中，曾有“苏南无大地主，不同于苏北”，“土改运动是不是太过火”等荒谬的看法；在“五反”运动中，为被捕的奸商喊冤；在“镇反”、 “肃反”运动中，看到熟识的人被镇压了，就不满意这些运动，最突出的是为汉奸钱凤皋、奸商赵章吉、张仁山叫冤。最近在“鸣”
  “放”中，仍然散布反党反社会主义的谬论，攻击党和政府。钱孙卿说，所有这些，证明他的反动思想十分炽烈，以至做了反动分子和地主、奸商的代言人。钱孙卿还表示回到江苏以后，准备继续接受群众的帮助，彻底交代自己的问题。
    接着，冷遹、刘国钧、李文杰等人批判钱孙卿不仅有极其卑鄙的资产阶级思想，还有极其反动的封建地主思想。
    会议执行主席李烛尘，最后谆谆地告诫钱孙卿回到江苏以后还要深刻检查，不要自绝于人民。
