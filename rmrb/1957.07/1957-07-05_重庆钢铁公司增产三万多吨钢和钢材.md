Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 4th: Chongqing Iron and Steel Company produced more than 32,000 tons of steel and steel products above the state plan in the first half of this year, completing 43% of the annual plan for increased production of steel and steel products.

This year, in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, Chongqing Iron and Steel Company first focused on the most important production departments to improve production management, resulting in significant improvements in production. Steel plates, the company's most important product, saw a production volume in the first half of this year that exceeded the total production volume of the entire last year by more than 2,000 tons. The company's total steel production in the first half of the year increased by 72% compared to the same period last year. The steel production in the steelmaking workshop also increased by more than 8,000 tons compared to the first half of last year.

This year, the company also strengthened its work in technical management, financial costs, and other aspects, changing the past tendency to unilaterally pursue output while neglecting quality and cost. The qualification rate of various major steel products generally reached more than 99% in the first half of this year, while most of them were only a little over 98% last year. At the same time, all production departments emphasized increasing production by saving raw materials, which greatly reduced the consumption of raw materials and waste losses. The steel saved from reducing metal consumption in the rolling mill alone in the first half of the year can be used to produce more than 1,600 tons of steel products.

    重庆钢铁公司增产三万多吨钢和钢材
    新华社重庆4日电　重庆钢铁公司今年上半年比国家计划多生产了三万二千多吨钢和钢材，完成全年增产钢和钢材计划的43％。
    今年在增产节约运动中，重庆钢铁公司首先抓住了最主要的生产部门来改进生产管理，使生产情况有了显著改进。作为这个公司最主要产品的钢板，今年上半年的产量比去年全年还要多二千多吨。上半年全公司的钢材产量比去年同期增加了72％。炼钢车间钢的产量也比去年上半年增加了八千多吨。
    这个公司今年还从技术管理、财务成本等多方面加强工作，改变了过去片面追求产量而忽视质量和成本的倾向。各种主要钢铁产品今年上半年的合格率一般都达到了99％以上，而去年大部分只有98％多一点。同时，各个生产部门强调从节约原材料中来增产，因此使原材料的消耗和浪费损失等大大减少。单是轧钢车间上半年从降低金属消耗中节约出来的钢，就可以多生产一千六百多吨钢材。
