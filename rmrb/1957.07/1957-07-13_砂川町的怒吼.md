    The Fury of Sunagawa Town
    Pei Da
    The heroic town of Sunagawa has once again erupted in a furious roar – the Japanese people's struggle against the expansion of American military bases has reignited.
    At dawn on June 27th, the alarm bells of Sunagawa Town shattered the silence of the rainy day, summoning farmers, workers, and students to the local U.S. military airfield. There, an official surveying team was secretly measuring the farmers' land in the rain. Prior to this, the Director of the Japanese Procurement Bureau had stated: "Surveying work will be carried out if it doesn't rain," seemingly attempting to deceive the local residents. However, the battle-tested residents of Sunagawa Town were not lulled into complacency, and they discovered the surveying team as soon as it appeared.
    When the Sunagawa Fourth Action Team attempted to enter the base to prevent the surveying work, U.S. military police hastily closed the gates. But the student contingent charged from the other side, knocking down the barriers and surging into the base. At this point, U.S. military police brandished tear gas to stop the students from advancing, leading to a standoff. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the surveying team hurriedly took the opportunity to slip away. The U.S. military police confronted the students for four hours. Finally, thirty military police officers armed with clubs launched an attack on the unarmed young students, seriously injuring three of them. At this point, the Japanese students, unbowed by violence, became even more incensed. Facing the U.S. military's machine guns, they sang the "Song of the National Independence Action Team": Against the enemy's bloody rule, we will fight with the blood of justice; fiercely strike down the traitors, drive away the national enemies!
    The brutality of the U.S. military enraged people from all walks of life in Japan. That night, residents of Sunagawa Town erected three sixty-meter-high flagpoles at the end of the airstrip, hoisted the Japanese flag high, and used it to obstruct U.S. military aircraft from taking off. The All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomies issued a statement on the 27th, strongly protesting the U.S. military police's violent act of injuring students. The statement said that no matter how brutal the oppression, it could not subdue the Japanese people. On the 29th, more than 3,000 people, including farmers, workers, and students from Sunagawa Town, held a rally, demanding that the Japanese government stop surveying the land and abolish the unequal treaties that subjugate Japan to the United States. The rally passed a declaration, resolutely stating that they would unite closely and fight to the end!
    On July 8th, the Japanese government dispatched two thousand police officers and more than a dozen armored vehicles to forcibly survey the land in Sunagawa Town. At the same time, Sunagawa Town held a mass rally of three thousand people, passing a letter of protest to U.S. President Eisenhower, strongly protesting the United States' insistence on expanding the U.S. military air base and preparing for atomic warfare, despite the opposition of the Japanese people. The day after the rally, about five hundred residents of Sunagawa Town, workers, students, and Socialist Party Diet members held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. Slogans of "Yankee Go Home!" and songs crossed the tightly closed gates and stormed into the U.S. Embassy.
    Starting from the 7th, Japanese worker and student groups began a major mobilization, with an estimated six thousand people heading to Sunagawa Town to support the residents' struggle against the expansion of the military base.
    The struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town against the expansion of the Tachikawa base was launched in the spring of 1955 after U.S. military authorities decided to expand five strategic air force bases in Tachikawa, Yokota, Kisarazu, Niigata, and Komaki. In 1955, the Japanese government dispatched five thousand police officers on several occasions, clashing with residents of Sunagawa Town and injuring more than two hundred residents. During that struggle, the Japanese authorities only managed to drive thirty wooden stakes into the land in Sunagawa Town. Local residents resolutely stated: "Although the stakes can be driven into the ground, they cannot be driven into our hearts." This slogan immediately became the slogan for the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. military bases nationwide. Under these circumstances, the Japanese authorities turned to a policy of appeasement and bribery towards the residents of Sunagawa Town, but this also met with failure.
    In 1956, the residents of Sunagawa Town put forward a new slogan: "We won't let the stakes be driven into our hearts, and we won't let the stakes be driven into our land!" In mid-October, the Japanese authorities mobilized two thousand police officers wearing helmets and carrying pistols and batons to launch two fierce attacks on the people defending the land of Sunagawa Town, injuring thousands of people. The residents of Sunagawa Town and workers and students from all over Japan held hands, forming a wall of flesh and blood with thousands of people, resisting the police's attack. The blood of the Japanese people once again stained the land they swore to defend. Under the protest of the people nationwide, the Japanese authorities finally stopped the surveying work. The U.S. military's plan to expand the air force base was once again dealt a severe blow in Sunagawa Town.
    For more than two years, the heroic struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town has set a shining example for the struggle against U.S. military bases in various parts of Japan. The strong will of the people of Sunagawa Town, who are "willing to be crushed to death by road rollers rather than let the U.S. military seize their land," demonstrates the heroic spirit of the Japanese people in safeguarding national sovereignty and independence. The righteous people of all countries are watching the new resistance struggle of the residents of Sunagawa Town with admiration and sympathy, hoping that they will achieve greater victories!

    砂川町的怒吼
    裴达
    英雄的砂川町又发出了愤怒的吼声——日本人民反对美国扩张军事基地的斗争重新爆发了。
    6月27日清晨，砂川町的警钟打破了雨天的沉寂，号召农民、工人和学生奔赴当地的美军飞机场。在那里，官方测量队正在冒雨偷偷地测量农民的土地。在这以前，日本调达局长曾发表声明：“如果不下雨就进行测量工作”，看来显然是在欺骗当地居民。但是，经过斗争考验的砂川町居民，并没有因此放松警惕，测量队一出现就被他们发现了。
    在砂川第四行动队要进入基地阻止测量工作的时候，美军宪兵赶忙关闭了栅门。但是学生队伍从另一边冲倒了栏栅，涌进了基地。这时，美国宪兵挥舞着摧泪弹阻止学生前进，同学生们形成了对峙的局面。测量队见势不妙，慌忙趁这个时候溜走了。美军宪兵同学生们对峙了四小时之久，以后，终于由三十名手持棍棒的宪兵向手无寸铁的青年学生发动了进攻，使三名学生受了重伤。这时，不为强暴所屈的日本学生群情更加激昂，他们面对着美军机关枪高唱“民族独立行动队之歌”：对敌人的血腥统治，要以正义的鲜血去抗争；狠狠打击卖国贼，赶走那民族敌人！
    美军暴行激怒了日本各界人民。当天夜间，砂川町居民在飞机跑道的尽头竖起了三根六十公尺高的旗杆，高高地挂起了日本国旗，并用以阻挠美军飞机起飞。全日本学生自治会总联合会在27日发表声明，严重抗议美军宪兵击伤学生的横暴行为。声明说，无论怎么凶暴的压迫，也不能使日本人民屈服。29日，砂川町农民、工人和学生等三千多人举行大会，要求日本政府停止测量土地，废除使日本隶属于美国的不平等条约。大会通过宣言，坚决表示要紧密团结，斗争到底！
    7月8日，日本政府出动两千名警察和十几辆装甲车，在砂川町强行测量土地。与此同时，砂川町举行了三千人的群众大会，通过了给美国总统艾森豪威尔的抗议书，严重抗议美国不顾日本人民的反对，强行扩大美军空军基地和进行原子战争准备。大会第二天，砂川町居民和工人、学生、社会党国会议员共约五百人，在东京美国大使馆前举行示威。“美国佬滚回去！”的口号声、歌声越过紧闭着的大门，冲进了美国大使馆。
    从7日开始，日本工人和学生团体开始大动员，预计将有六千人前往砂川町，支援砂川町居民反对扩大军事基地的斗争。
    砂川町居民反对扩大立川基地的斗争，是在1955年春天美军当局决定扩建立川、横田、木更津、新澙、小牧等五个战略空军机场之后被迫展开的。1955年，日本政府先后出动了五千名警察，数次和砂川町居民发生冲突，打伤了二百多名居民。在那次斗争中，日本当局只在砂川町的土地上打下了三十个木桩。当地居民坚决表示：“尽管木桩能打在土里，但是打不进我们的心”。这个口号立刻变成了日本全国人民反对美军基地的斗争口号，在这种情况下，日本当局转而对砂川町居民实现怀柔和收买的政策，但结果也遭到了失败。
    1956年，砂川町居民提出了新的斗争口号：“不让木桩打进我们的心，也不让木桩打进我们的地里！”10月中旬，日本当局动员了两千名带着钢盔、手枪、木棍的警察向保卫砂川町土地的人民群众进行了两次凶猛的攻击，使成千的人受了伤。砂川町居民和从日本全国各地前来支援的工人、学生们手挽着手，用数千人的身体结成了血肉的围墙，抗击了警察队的进攻，日本人民的鲜血又一次染红了他们誓死保卫的土地。日本当局在全国人民抗议之下，终于停止了测量工作。美军扩充空军基地的计划，在砂川町再一次遭到严重的打击。
    两年多来，砂川町居民的英勇斗争，给日本各地反对美国军事基地的斗争树立了光辉的榜样。砂川町人民“宁愿被压路机辗死，也不让美军夺走土地”的坚强意志，表现了日本人民维护民族主权和独立的英勇气概。各国的正义人民怀着敬佩和同情的心情注视着砂川町居民新的反抗斗争，希望他们取得更大的胜利！
