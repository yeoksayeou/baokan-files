The entire staff of the State Planning Commission holds a meeting to protest Zhang Bojun's slander against the Commission.

    (Reported by our newspaper) The entire staff of the State Planning Commission and the State Statistical Bureau unanimously and with great anger protested Zhang Bojun's slander against the Commission.
    The article written by Min Ganghou, a standing committee member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, published in the People's Daily on July 4, exposed the circumstances of an emergency meeting convened by bourgeois rightist Zhang Bojun on June 6 with several well-known scholars. At this meeting, Zhang Bojun shamelessly fabricated rumors: "The problems within the Communist Party are also significant. The State Planning Commission is almost entirely composed of Party members, but big-character posters calling for Li Fuchun's dismissal were posted at Li's door. This was unexpected."
    The staff of the State Planning Commission personally participated in the rectification movement of the Commission and personally saw every big-character poster. They could not tolerate Zhang Bojun's unfounded slander and defamation. A fire of anger was immediately ignited in the office buildings of the State Planning Commission and the State Statistical Bureau. The Transportation Bureau, Finance and Banking Bureau, Foreign Trade Bureau and other units held meetings successively to protest this groundless and shameless rant of the rightists. Protest big-character posters were plastered all over the square pillars in the hall. Many comrades demanded that a mass meeting be convened to express their protest, and more people wanted to question Zhang Bojun as to why he fabricated rumors and slandered the state planning economic organs.
    At 5:00 PM, the entire staff of the State Planning Commission and the State Statistical Bureau gathered in the auditorium to hold a meeting, expressing a strong protest against Zhang Bojun's slander and defamation. Before the chairman's brief speech was even finished, slips of paper requesting to speak at the meeting were continuously handed to the stage.
    At the meeting, Comrade Zheng Xiuming said: "I am a civil servant in Director Li Fuchun's office. I have never seen such big-character posters in front of the director's office. I want to ask Zhang Bojun, what is your basis for spreading this kind of rumor?"
    Comrade Qi Xiangwu, representative of the Statistical Bureau, said: "We are all comrades working under the leadership of Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and we work in the same building. No one has seen such big-character posters posted at his office door. This once again proves that right-wing careerists are spreading rumors and setting fires everywhere, and are frantically attacking the Party."
    After denouncing Zhang Bojun's reactionary remarks, Comrade Jin Jiayuan, representative of the Machinery Bureau, excitedly asked, "Have we ever seen big-character posters demanding the dismissal of Vice Premier Li Fuchun?" The hall immediately resounded with cries of "No!" He angrily demanded that Zhang Bojun publicly examine his reactionary words and deeds, and demanded that Zhang Bojun bear all political responsibility. Finally, he shouted: "We must defeat the frantic attacks of all right-wing elements!"
    Comrade Zhao Lianzhen said: "The comrades of our State Planning Commission have all seen it with their own eyes. There is no such thing. It is simply seeing a ghost in broad daylight. It is a complete and utter fabrication. Why did Zhang Bojun launch a vicious attack on the State Planning Commission? Because the planned economy is the fundamental system for the development of our country's socialist economy. And this gang of rightists extremely hate the transformation of the private ownership of the means of production into public ownership. The State Planning Commission is a comprehensive department of our Party and government that guides the national economy to develop in a planned and proportionate manner. The rightists' attack on the Commission is nothing more than an attempt to destroy this strategic stronghold. This is in the same vein as Zhang's remarks attacking the State Planning Commission at the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee on May 8."
    Twenty people spoke at the meeting, and more requested to speak. Some represented a bureau, some represented a division, and some spoke individually, but they all represented the wishes of the entire staff of the State Planning Commission and the State Statistical Bureau.
    In accordance with the requirements of these speeches, the meeting unanimously passed a letter of protest to Zhang Bojun, and elected twenty representatives to question and protest Zhang Bojun in person.

    国家计委全体工作人员举行大会
    抗议章伯钧对计委的造谣诽谤
    本报讯　国家计划委员会和国家统计局全体工作人员以极大的愤怒一致抗议章伯钧对计委的造谣诽谤。
    7月4日人民日报上发表的民盟中央常务委员闵刚侯写的文章，揭露资产阶级右派分子章伯钧6月6日召集的一次几位知名学者紧急会议的情况。在这个会上章伯钧曾无耻造谣：“共产党内部问题也大，计委差不多都是党员，但撤换李富春的大字报贴在李的门口，这是估计不到的。”
    国家计委的工作人员都亲自参加过计委的整风运动，亲自看过每张大字报，他们无法容忍章伯钧这种无中生有的造谣污蔑，在国家计委和国家统计局的办公大楼里，立即燃起了愤怒的火焰。交通局、财金局、外贸局等单位先后集会，抗议右派分子的这种毫无根据的无耻谰言。抗议的大字报，贴满了大厅的方柱上。许多同志要求召开群众大会，表示自己的抗议，更多的人要去质问章伯钧，为什么造谣污蔑国家计划经济机关。
    下午五时，国家计委和国家统计局全体工作人员聚集在大礼堂举行大会，对章伯钧的造谣污蔑，表示了强烈的抗议。当主席简短的发言还没有完，要求在会上发言的纸条已经接连地递上台来。
    在大会上，郑修明同志说：“我是李富春主任办公室的公务员，主任办公室门前从来没有看见这样的大字报，我要问章伯钧，你是根据什么来散布这种谣言”。
    统计局代表齐向武同志说：“我们都是在李富春副总理领导下，又是在一个楼里工作的同志，谁也没有看到这样的大字报贴在他办公室的门口。这再一次证明右派野心家在到处造谣放火，向党猖狂进攻”。
    机械局代表金家源同志痛斥了章伯钧的反动谰言后，激动地问“我们有没有看到过要求撤换李富春副总理的大字报？”会场上立即响起了“没有！”的呼声。他愤怒地要求章伯钧公开检查其反动言行，并要求章伯钧应承担一切政治责任。最后，他高呼：“一定要打退一切右派分子的猖狂进攻！”
    赵莲贞同志说：“我们国家计委的同志有目共睹，那儿有这回事，简直是白天见鬼，完全是彻头彻尾的捏造。章伯钧为什么要对国家计委进行恶毒的攻击呢？因为计划经济是我国发展社会主义经济的根本制度。而变生产资料私有制为公有制，是这帮右派分子所极端痛恨的。国家计委是我们党和政府指导国民经济有计划、按比例发展的综合部门。右派分子对计委的攻击，不过是企图摧毁这个战略据点而已。这和章5月8日在中共中央统战部座谈会上攻击国家计委的言论是一脉相承的。”
    在会上发言的达二十人，要求发言的更多，他们有的代表一个局，有的是代表一个处，有的是个人发言，但是却都代表着计委和统计局全体工作人员的意愿。
    根据这些发言的要求，大会一致通过了向章伯钧的抗议书，并且推派了二十名代表去当面向章伯钧质问和抗议。
