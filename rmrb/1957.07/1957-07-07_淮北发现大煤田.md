　　Huaibei Discovers Large Coalfield
　　(Our dispatch from Hefei, July 5) Reporter Wu Rongjiang reports: Geological exploration personnel, known as the pioneers of industrial construction, have newly discovered a large coalfield area of ​​120 square kilometers in the Huaibei Plain. Geological data for the construction of three pairs of mines have now been ascertained; geological data reports on these three well fields will soon be completed and submitted to the coal mine design departments.
　　The geological exploration team, which began operating in the Huaibei Plain in 1955, is currently concentrating its main efforts on drilling work in the Zhahe Plain of Suixi County. Through drilling, it has been confirmed that the Zhahe Plain is a large coalfield. According to preliminary statistics, the coal reserves in the southern part of the Zhahe Plain alone amount to 300 million tons. It is estimated that more than ten pairs of mines can be built in the entire Zhahe Plain. The three well fields that have been explored are located in the southern part of the Zhahe Plain; there are mainly three minable coal seams, and the thickness of the coal seams is relatively stable, with thicker ones reaching three to four meters. Most of the coal in these three well fields is anthracite, and one-third is coking coal. Currently, drilling work has also begun in an area of over 1,000 square kilometers westward and southward from the Zhahe Plain, extending into Yongcheng County in Henan Province.
　　Based on the geological structure of the Huaibei Plain, it has long been believed that coal is deposited here. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, no exploration was conducted. Now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, geological exploration personnel have finally discovered a large coalfield here. After the construction of wells and mining in the future, the increasingly developed industry in East China will be better able to meet its coal needs, and the people of Huaibei, who are constantly suffering from disasters and often lack fuel, will also have sufficient fuel.
　　In order to accelerate the exploration of coal resources in the Huaibei Plain, the Ministry of Geology has recently increased investment in geological exploration in Huaibei and has brought in advanced well logging instruments.

    淮北发现大煤田
    本报合肥5日电　记者吴荣江报道：号称工业建设尖兵的地质勘探人员，在千里淮北平原新发现了面积达一百二十平方公里的大块煤田区。现在已经探明了可建三对矿井的地质资料；关于这三个井田的地质资料报告，不久即可编写完毕，交给煤矿设计部门。
    从1955年开始活跃在淮北平原的地质勘探队伍，目前正集中主要力量在濉溪县的闸河平原上进行钻探工作。经过钻探，已经肯定闸河平原是一块大煤田。据初步统计，仅闸河平原南部，煤炭储量就有三亿吨。整个闸河平原，估计可以建设十多对矿井。已经探明的三个井田，是在闸河平原南部；可采煤层主要有三层，煤层厚度比较平稳，较厚的有三到四公尺。这三个井田大部分是无烟煤，三分之一是炼焦用煤。现在，从闸河平原向西向南一千余平方公里的范围内，钻探工作也已开始，并且跨到了河南省的永城县境。
    根据淮北平原的地质构造情况，很早就有人认为这里蕴藏有煤炭。但在国民党反动派统治时期，没有进行过勘查。现在，在共产党领导下，地质勘探人员终于在这里发现了大煤田。将来建井开采以后，华东地区日益发展的工业在用煤方面将可更好的得到满足，因不断遭灾而经常缺乏燃料的淮北人民，也将得到充足的燃料。
    为了加速探明淮北平原的煤炭资源，地质部最近增加了淮北地质勘探的投资，并调来了先进的探井测定仪器。
