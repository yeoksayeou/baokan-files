    Rapid Advances in Soviet Aviation Industry
    Four New Aircraft Undergoing Flight Tests
    (People's Daily, Moscow, July 10) Several new types of turb jet and turboprop giant civil aircraft were exhibited today at the Vnukovo Airport, demonstrating the rapid advances in the Soviet aviation industry.
    Among them are the Tu-104A and Tu-110, designed by designers led by Tupolev; the Ukrainian type, designed by designers led by Antonov; and the Moscow type, designed by designers led by Ilyushin. According to Soviet Aviation Industry Minister Demintiev, speaking to a reporter from Pravda, these new aircraft are more economical and comfortable than existing civil aircraft. They can carry twelve to fourteen tons of cargo, and the cabins can accommodate seventy to one hundred passengers. They can fly at an altitude of eight to ten thousand meters, so they are not affected by atmospheric conditions. They are equipped with the latest equipment, so they can fly day and night in complex weather conditions.
    The Tu-104A is an improved version of the fifty-seat Tu-104. It has three cabins and can carry seventy passengers. It has a maximum speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour, a cruising speed of 800 kilometers per hour, and can fly 3,000 kilometers without landing.
    The Tu-110 has four turbojet engines. It will fly on domestic and international trunk lines to carry passengers, cargo, and mail. It comes in two versions, one for seventy-eight passengers and one for one hundred passengers. It has four cabins. It has a maximum speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour, a cruising speed of 800 kilometers per hour, and can fly 3,450 kilometers without landing.
    The Ukrainian type has four turboprop engines. It can fly to an altitude of 8,000 meters, with a cruising speed of more than 800 kilometers per hour. It has three cabins and can carry eighty-four passengers. The cabin has a special children's room.
    The Moscow type has four turboprop engines. It will be used on domestic and international routes to carry passengers, cargo, and mail. There are several types, the main one of which can carry 75 to 100 passengers. Its cruising speed is 600 to 650 kilometers per hour.

    苏联航空工业突飞猛进
    四种新式飞机在试航中
    本报莫斯科10日电　今天在伏努科夫飞机场上展览了几种涡轮喷气和涡轮螺旋桨的新式巨型民航机，它们显示苏联航空工业的突飞猛进。
    这里有由图波列夫领导的设计师们制造的图—104A型和图—110型，有安东诺夫领导的设计师们制造的乌克兰型，有伊留申领导的设计师们制造的莫斯科型。据苏联航空工业部部长杰明捷夫对真理报记者谈：这些新式飞机比现有的民航机更经济，更舒服。它们能载十二到十四吨货物，客舱里能载七十到一百位乘客。它们能飞在八千到一万公尺高空，所以不受大气条件的影响。它们装配有最新的设备，所以能够在复杂的气候里昼夜航行。
    图—104A型是把五十座位的图—104改进的产物。它有三个客舱，能载七十位乘客。最高速度一小时一千公里，航行速度一小时八百公里，航行三千公里不着陆。
    图—110型有四个涡轮喷气发动机。它将航行在苏联国内和国际干线上，用来载客、运货和送邮件。它有载七十八位和一百位乘客的两种。它有四个客舱。最高速度一小时一千公里，航行速度一小时八百公里，航行三千四百五十公里不着陆。乌克兰型有四个涡轮螺旋桨发动机。能飞到八千公尺高，航行速度一小时八百多公里。它有三个客舱，可载八十四位乘客。舱里设有专门的儿童室。
    莫斯科型有四个涡轮螺旋桨发动机。它将用在国内和国际航线上，载运乘客、货物和邮件。它有几种，主要的一种可载客七十五人到一百人。它的航行速度一小时六百到六百五十公里。
