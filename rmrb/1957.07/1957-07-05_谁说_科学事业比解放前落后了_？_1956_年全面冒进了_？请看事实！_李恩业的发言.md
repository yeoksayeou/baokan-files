I fully support the Constitution, the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." I will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's principles to draw a clear line in politics and ideology with the right-wing elements, and carry out necessary and resolute struggles against such people.

I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Bo Yibo of the State Council, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, President Dong Biwu of the Supreme People's Court, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. These reports fully demonstrate the brilliant achievements and great victories of our socialist construction and socialist transformation. These reports once again prove the superiority of the people's democratic regime. Under the leadership of the Party and the generous and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, the path of socialism is the only correct, bright, and happy path for the people of the whole country. The people's regime under the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance have been further consolidated due to the growth of socialist economic power.

Facts Seen in Two Inspections

As a coking chemical worker, I saw with great excitement and gratitude the high-speed development of China's coking chemical industry, and the unprecedented growth and improvement of the ranks of coking chemical technology operators, design and construction personnel, teachers, and scientific researchers. The planned production of 7.46 million tons of coke in 1957 is a figure I could not have dreamed of before liberation. The coking chemical industry was almost blank in old China. Those who studied this major had to go abroad to study; the bleak situation of having no place to use their skills after returning home is in stark contrast to today's brilliant development, which makes today's greatness and brightness even more apparent. I firmly oppose the extremely erroneous statement that "China's first Five-Year Plan was ruined." I use the facts I saw and learned in two inspections to oppose the erroneous statements that "China's national economic development plan had a full-scale leap forward in 1956" and "China's scientific undertakings are more backward after liberation than during the Kuomintang era."

Last April, I was transferred from Benxi Iron and Steel Company to the Beijing Iron and Steel Industry Comprehensive Research Institute. In December, I returned to Benxi for inspection. Having been away from Benxi for more than seven months, I felt that time had passed quickly, but in this short six-day inspection, I saw that Benxi City had made even faster progress in production and construction and other aspects, which made me deeply appreciate the correctness of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's call to oppose right-leaning conservatism and the enormous power it generated; at the same time, I also saw certain tensions in the great construction and great development.

Benxi City's 1956 state-owned and local state-owned industrial production plan is expected to fully complete the main indicators such as output value, labor productivity, profit, and cost. The two major state-owned enterprises in Benxi City, Iron and Steel Company and Mining Bureau, are also expected to complete the total output value of the fifth Five-Year Plan in 1957 in 1956; the development of local state-owned industry is also very fast, with the total output value in 1956 alone being 524 percent of that in 1952, and the output value task in 1957 of the fifth Five-Year Plan was completed ahead of schedule in May last year.

The early commissioning of new large-scale enterprises such as the state-expanded and reconstructed Gongyuan Cement Plant, the two coke ovens and chemical product equipment of the Gongyuan Coking Plant, the No. 1 turbine generator of the Third Power Plant, the new large blast furnace of the Gongyuan Iron Plant, and the Second Machine Repair Plant has greatly improved the technical level of industrial production in Benxi, and made great contributions to the needs of national industrialization, the training of cadres, and the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards. This is also a major achievement of Benxi City's socialist construction.

The original factories and mining enterprises also saw a new upsurge under the call to oppose right-leaning conservatism. Advanced producer movements were also widely carried out in various factories, and a large number of rationalization proposals were put forward. The enthusiasm of the vast number of employees to learn and promote advanced experience was also unprecedentedly high. Taking Benxi Steel Plant as an example, with the rational increase of a small amount of equipment, the creative enthusiasm of the employees was further brought into play, and the potential of the existing equipment was fully utilized, so that the total output value and output were doubled. All this shows that Benxi City's industrial production and construction are developing rapidly in accordance with the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical."

During the inspection, according to the reflections from various aspects and what I saw personally, there are still some problems and tensions in industrial production, such as tight transportation and loading and unloading, insufficient raw materials, engineering design, construction quality, equipment efficiency, cadre level, and employee housing. These problems have already been reported in writing to the Standing Committee for transfer to relevant departments for resolution, and will not be repeated.

This year I participated in the inspection in Beijing and visited more than a dozen scientific research units under the Academy of Sciences and various ministries. I saw a rapid increase in scientific research institutions, especially the establishment of research units that did not exist in old China, such as atomic energy, electronics, and automation research institutes, which marked a new milestone in the development of China's scientific research work; the ranks of scientific researchers have been rapidly expanded, and I saw two research institutes with more than a thousand people; the instruments, medicines, and books and equipment needed for scientific research work have been greatly supplied and supported; scientific research work has achieved great achievements, such as the high purification of semiconductor germanium and the trial production of semiconductor electron tubes. These facts have made me deeply appreciate the Party and the government's concern and attention to scientific research undertakings. The formulation of the twelve-year scientific plan has enabled scientific workers to recognize their glorious future and the arduous tasks they bear. The optimistic assessment of the scientific research situation made by President Guo Moruo in his speech at the Supreme State Conference has increased our courage, confidence, and strength to overcome difficulties and improve research work.

Areas That Still Need to Be Improved

Because the foundation left by old China was very weak, although there has been great development in the past few years, it is still far from meeting social needs. In the rapid development, there are inevitably some unhealthy situations. In order to raise the vigilance of our scientific researchers, and in order to win the attention and help of all representatives to our scientific research work, I now put forward some unhealthy situations that I saw in this inspection that I think.

1. Situations That Do Not Conform to the Policy of Building the Country Through Diligence and Thrift

(1) Too much land is occupied. For example, a research institute in the eastern suburbs has requisitioned 55 mu of land, which is about 36,630 square meters. At present, the buildings occupy a total of about 3,666 square meters, and the land use efficiency is only 10 percent. The institute has handed over 6 mu of land to farmers for use, but there is still a lot of open space. According to the reflection, the reasons for this situation are that it was originally planned to establish a comprehensive research institute, but later it was expanded into a research institute, and the headquarters and another research institute were found in the western suburbs. The second is that the Urban Planning Commission did not agree in the past to build employee dormitories in the area of the already requisitioned land, so the open space cannot be used. For example, a research institute in the western suburbs has requisitioned 158,000 square meters of land, and the current land use area, including temporary buildings, accounts for no more than 20,000 square meters, and the land use efficiency is only 13 percent. If the land area occupied by temporary buildings is not included, the land utilization rate is only 11 percent.

(2) The building area is large. For example, a research institute in the northern suburbs has built about 22,399 square meters of experimental buildings, experimental factories, design buildings, etc. (basically completed in the second quarter of this year) because the original plan was for a total of 4,300 employees. At present, there are only 463 people, and each person occupies about 50 square meters of building area.

(3) The utilization efficiency of books, instruments, and equipment is not high. For some books that can be temporarily used in common, such as periodicals, and some equipment that can be temporarily used in common, such as material testing machines, the import departments are required to supply more and more urgently, which has caused some tension and difficulties in the country's foreign exchange and supply departments that can be eased.

(4) There is a lack of senior scientific research personnel, and the increase in junior researchers is faster and the proportion is larger. Many young scientific researchers feel that their enthusiasm and strength cannot be fully utilized, and they cannot get full guidance and training from senior scientific researchers. Senior scientific researchers feel that young people are demanding training too urgently and cannot concentrate on research.

2. Organizational Leadership

(1) Leaders do not have enough contact with the masses. At a forum during the inspection, the masses asked that the number of times the president, vice presidents, and secretary-general of the Academy of Sciences visit the institute each year should not be less than the number of times the people's representatives inspect.

(2) Leaders hold many concurrent positions and do not have enough time to lead research work. According to a reflection at a forum, a leading comrade holds more than 20 concurrent positions and can only go to the institute for two hours a week. The leading comrade himself also believes that this problem should be solved as soon as possible. Another institute's director can only go to the institute to work one afternoon a week. I think that if we can appropriately concentrate our energy to do research work well, it will be more beneficial to the country and the people than holding too many concurrent positions and dispersing our energy.

(3) The division of labor and cooperation in scientific research work is not good enough. For example, the research work on recovering semiconductor germanium from ammonia water jointly carried out by Benxi Iron and Steel Company and our Iron and Steel Industry Comprehensive Research Institute has only been coordinated with relevant topics within the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Therefore, we, as the raw material supply research department, cannot figure out the research and use needs. The tasks assigned by the ministry are urgent and heavy, forcing us to abandon the normal and reliable research procedures and carry out semi-industrial production tests in advance. Scientific research work often encounters accidents and difficulties, so carrying out semi-industrial production tests in advance may cause greater waste to the country. The research and use departments also do not understand that we are already making the greatest efforts, and they are still worried that no one cares about the raw materials every day. On the other hand, the research and use departments have not formally submitted the major problem of the loss of 90% of germanium in processing to relevant departments for research to reduce losses, such as the research on cutting slices with ultrasonic new technology and recovering germanium from cutting chips. This may cause a huge waste of valuable rare metal germanium, and at the same time increase the burden and pressure on our raw material supply researchers tenfold. I saw this problem during the inspection, and I would like to take this opportunity to tell everyone that our research and recovery of germanium is extracted from ammonia water with a concentration of 5/10,000. "It is not easy to obtain." We have the need and the responsibility to cherish it more.

Although today's coking chemical industry has made great progress, it is still far from meeting the ever-increasing needs of society. Chairman Mao said: "The establishment of the socialist system has opened up a path for us to reach the ideal state, and the realization of the ideal state depends on our hard work." As a member of the coking chemical workers, I am willing to, under the leadership of the Party and the government, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao to "continue to transform myself, gradually abandon the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian, communist worldview," strengthen learning, further adapt to the needs of the country and society, and contribute more to our glorious and great common cause!

    谁说“科学事业比解放前落后了”？
    “1956年全面冒进了”？请看事实！
    李恩业的发言
    我完全拥护宪法，拥护工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，拥护毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演。我坚决遵照毛主席的方针在政治上和思想上同右派分子划清界限，并且对这种人进行必要的坚决斗争。
    我完全同意国务院周总理，李、薄两位副总理，最高人民检察院张检察长，最高人民法院董院长和人大常委会彭副委员长等的报告。这些报告充分说明了我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的辉煌成就与伟大胜利。这些报告又一次证明了人民民主政权的优越性。全国人民在党的领导和苏联等兄弟国家慷慨无私的援助下，走社会主义的道路是唯一正确的、光明和幸福的道路。工人阶级领导下的人民政权和工农联盟，已经由于社会主义经济力量的增长而更加巩固。
    在两次视察中看到的事实
    作为一个炼焦化学工作者，我怀着万分兴奋和感激的心情看到了我国炼焦化学工业生产的高速度发展；炼焦化学技术操作、设计施工、教学和科学研究工作者队伍的空前壮大与提高。一九五七年计划生产七百四十六万吨焦炭是我在解放前梦想不到的数字。炼焦化学工业在旧中国几乎是个空白。学习这个专业的人只有到外国去学习；学成归国后，技术无用武之地的暗淡情况和今天的辉煌发展情况相对照，就更显出今天的伟大和光明。我坚决反对“我国第一个五年计划搞坏了”的极端错误言论。我用在两次视察中所看到和了解到的事实来反对“我国的发展国民经济计划在一九五六年全面冒进了”、“中国科学事业在解放后比国民党时代落后了”的错误言论。
    去年四月我由本溪钢铁公司调到北京钢铁工业综合研究所工作，十二月又回到本溪视察，离开本溪七个多月，感到时间过得很快，但是在这次短短六天视察中看到本溪市在生产建设上和其他方面的工作进步更快，使我深切体会到党中央和毛主席所提出来的反右倾保守思想的正确和它所产生的巨大力量；同时也看到在大建设大发展中某些紧张情况。
    本溪市一九五六年国营及地方国营的工业生产计划预计可全面完成产值、劳动生产率、利润、成本等主要指标。本溪市两大国营企业的钢铁公司和矿务局，预计一九五六年也可完成五年计划中一九五七年的生产总值；地方国营工业发展也很快，仅一九五六年的生产总值即为一九五二年的百分之五百二十四，并在去年五月提前完成五年计划中一九五七年的产值任务。
    国家扩建和改建的工源水泥厂，工源焦化厂的两座炼焦炉和化学产品设备，第三电厂的一号透平发电机，工源铁厂的一座新式大型高炉和第二机修厂等新式大型企业的提前投入生产，大大提高了本溪工业生产技术水平，对国家工业化的需要和培养干部以及提高人民物质文化生活水平都有巨大贡献，这也是本溪市社会主义建设的重大成就。
    原有的厂矿企业，在反对右倾保守的号召下，也出现了新的高潮。各厂并普遍地开展了先进生产者运动，提出大量的合理化建议，广大职工学习和推广先进经验的热情也空前高涨，仅以本溪钢厂为例，在合理增加少量设备的条件下，进一步发挥了职工的创造积极性，充分利用了现有设备潜力，使生产总值和产量增加了一倍。这都说明本溪市的工业生产建设遵循着“又多，又快，又好，又省”的方针迅速发展。
    在视察期间，根据各方面反映和亲自看到的，在工业生产上还存在一些问题和紧张情况，例如运输装卸紧张，原料不足，工程设计，施工质量，设备效率，干部水平，职工住宅等某些问题，早已书面报告常委会转有关部门解决，不再重复。
    今年我参加了在北京市的视察，看了十几个科学院的和各部所属的科学研究单位，我看到了科学研究机构迅速增加，其中尤其是旧中国没有的研究单位，如原子能，电子学，自动化等研究所的成立，标志着我国科学研究工作发展的新里程；科学研究工作者的队伍迅速扩大，我看到两个一千多人的研究所；科学研究工作所需要的仪器药品和图书设备得到大力的供应和支援；科学研究工作得到很大的成就，例如半导体锗的高度提纯和半导体电子管的试制。这些事实都使我深切体会到党和政府对科学研究事业的关怀和重视，十二年科学规划的制定使科学工作者认清自己的光荣前途和所负担的艰巨任务。郭院长在最高国务会议上发言中对科学研究情况所作的乐观估计，使我们增加勇气，增加信心，增加力量，来克服困难，改进研究工作。
    还需要继续改进的地方
    由于旧中国留下的基础十分薄弱，虽然几年来有了很大发展，仍然远不能适应社会需要。在迅速发展中也免不了有某些不健康的情况。为了提高我们科学研究工作者的警惕，为了争取各位代表对我们科学研究工作的注意和帮助，现在我提出在这次视察中所看到的某些我所认为不健康的情况。
    一、不合于勤俭建国方针的情况
    （1）占用土地较多，例如东郊一个研究所已征购土地五十五亩，约折合三万六千六百三十平方公尺，目前已建房屋占地共约三千六百六十六平方公尺，土地使用效率仅百分之十，该所已将土地六亩交农民使用，但空地仍多，根据反映造成这个情况的原因，其一是原准备成立综合研究所，后来扩大成研究院，将院部和另一个研究所在西郊另找地点，其二是城市规划委员会过去不同意该所在已征购土地面积范围内建造职工宿舍，因而不能利用空地，例如西郊一个研究所已征购土地十五万八千平方公尺，目前土地使用面积连同临时建筑物占地三千平方公尺合计在内也不过二万平方公尺，土地使用效率仅百分之十三，如果不计临时建筑物占地面积，土地利用率仅百分之十一。
    （2）房屋面积较大，例如北郊一个研究所因为原计划总工作人数四千三百人，已建筑了试验楼，试验工厂，设计楼等共约二万二千三百九十九平方公尺（今年第二季基本完工），目前仅有四百六十三人，计每人占房屋面积约五十平方公尺。
    （3）图书仪器及设备使用效率不高，对某些可以暂时合用共用的图书如过期刊物，某些可以暂时合用共用的设备如材料试验机等要求进口部门供应较多较急，因而造成国家外汇上和供应部门的某些可以缓和的紧张情况和困难。
    （4）高级科学研究人员缺乏，低级研究人员增加较快比例较大，许多青年科学研究人员感到积极性和力量不能充分发挥，得不到高级科学研究人员的充分指导和培养。高级科学研究人员感到青年要求培养过急，不能专心研究。
    二、组织领导方面
   （1）领导与群众接触不够，在视察中一次座谈会上群众提出要求科学院院长、副院长、秘书长等领导同志每年到所的次数不少于人民代表视察的次数。
   （2）领导兼职多，没有足够的时间来领导研究工作，根据一次座谈会上反映，领导同志身兼二十余职，每周只能到所二小时，领导同志自己也认为应当早日解决这个问题。另外一个研究所所长每周只有一个下午可以到所工作，我认为如果能适当地集中精力做好研究工作会比过多地兼任职务，分散精力对国家人民更有利些。
   （3）科学研究工作中分工协作不够好，例如本溪钢铁公司和我们钢铁工业综合研究所合作的从氨水中回收半导体锗的研究工作只在冶金部内与有关专题进行了协调，因此使我们作为原料供应研究部门摸不清研究使用需要的底。部里交给的任务较急较重，迫使我们不能不放弃正常的可靠的研究程序，提前进行半工业生产试验。科学研究工作常常会遇到意外和困难，因此提前进行半工业生产试验就有可能给国家造成较大的浪费。研究使用部门也不了解我们已经在作最大努力，他们还天天愁原料无人过问。另一方面，研究使用部门对于锗在加工中损失十分之九的重大问题，也没有正式提交有关部门进行研究，减少损失，例如用超声波新技术截片和从截片制片碎屑中回收锗的研究等，这样就一方面可能造成宝贵的稀有金属锗的巨大浪费，同时也加重了我们原料供应研究工作者十倍的负担和压力。我在视察中看到这个问题，我想借这个机会告诉大家，我们研究回收锗是从千万分之五的氨水中提出来的，“得来大不易”我们有必要也有责任更珍视它。
  今天的炼焦化学工业虽然已经有了巨大的发展，但是还远不能适应社会日益增长的需要，毛主席说：“社会主义制度的建立已经给我们开辟了一条达到理想境界的道路，而理想境界的实现还要靠我们辛勤劳动。”作为炼焦化学工作者的一员，我愿在党政的领导下，按照毛主席所指示的方向“继续改造自己，逐步抛弃资产阶级的世界观而树立无产阶级的，共产主义的世界观”，加强学习，进一步适应国家社会需要，为我们光荣伟大的共同事业贡献出更多的力量！
