Zhang Naiqi, under the Alluring Banner of the "Seven Gentlemen," Engaged in Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Activities

We are members of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA). Since joining the CDNCA nearly seven years ago, we have received significant education from the organization under the leadership of the Party, and our ideological transformation has been greatly assisted and supervised. However, Zhang Naiqi, as one of the leaders of the CDNCA, not only did not provide us with any education or assistance but, on the contrary, used insidious means to hold us back at every turn. Because of our low level of education and poor political sense, we always fell for his conspiracies on certain issues. Over the years, we were unknowingly mesmerized by his writings and speeches. This time, under the guise of helping the Party to rectify its work style, he again released a large amount of poison, trying to drag us down again, but this vicious conspiracy was quickly exposed by the people and refuted by the CDNCA Central Committee, which awakened us and saved us. When we think about the poisonous drugs that Zhang Naiqi spread to us in the past, we feel terrified. If the people had not quickly exposed his conspiracy, we would have been in danger of being poisoned to death by him. Therefore, we sincerely thank the Party and the people.

Zhang Naiqi is a special rightist element in our industrial and commercial circles. He uses the banner of the "Seven Gentlemen" of the past to carry out criminal activities against the Party and the people. After liberation, he pretended to support the Party, but privately peddled a large amount of capitalist goods. He had a planned conspiracy, vicious steps, and an ultimate goal. He used the remarks of backward elements in the industrial and commercial circles as capital to attack the Party, and used letter contacts to encourage and support backward elements, echoing each other. He always said that progressive industrialists and businessmen were fake progressives, and that industrialists and businessmen who were dissatisfied with the government were true progressives, in order to expand his market and attempt to overthrow socialism and restore capitalism. All his actions are in violation of the Constitution, against the people of the whole country, and aimed at dragging the patriotic industrial and commercial circles away from socialism to a point of no return. He is insidious and vicious, more vicious than jackals and tigers. We are extremely indignant and want to accuse him to the people of the whole country.

Zhang Naiqi's Fallacies and Their Adverse Influence in Anhui and Henan Provinces

Zhang Naiqi's opposition to the Party and the people has been consistent. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he had secret dealings with Song Ziwen, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and others. When he was the acting secretary-general and concurrently the director of the finance department of the puppet provincial government in Anhui, he also had close relations with Kuomintang secret agents and had physical relations with a female secret agent named Wang, doing many unspeakable things. When he worked in the National Salvation Association, he sent a secret letter sealed with sealing wax to Song Ziwen. After he was arrested and released from prison, he asked the National Salvation Daily to promote "less summons, more suggestions." When he was in Hankou, he sold himself to Chen Cheng and even served as a central cadre of the reactionary Three People's Principles Youth League. After liberation, he pretended to be progressive. Especially since the First National Congress of the CDNCA in 1955, Zhang Naiqi's peddling of capitalism has become even more blatant. At the solemn meeting, he even distorted the speeches of national leaders, saying, "The Chinese national bourgeoisie is the red bourgeoisie," attempting to make the bourgeoisie resist transformation and oppose the leadership of the working class. In 1956, he denied that the Chinese national bourgeoisie at the present stage still had two sides. This year, he took advantage of the opportunity to help the Party rectify its work style and released fallacies such as blurring class boundaries and denying the leadership of the working class. How many people in the national industrial and commercial circles unknowingly ate his honey-flavored arsenic and became his ideological prisoners. Since Zhang Naiqi issued extremely sinful fallacies at the symposium held by the Central United Front Work Department, the ideological fluctuations of some industrial and commercial circles in Anhui and Henan provinces have been very severe. In particular, backward elements are most interested in his speech. They said, "Zhang Naiqi's words truly represent us. Zhang Naiqi is truly worthy of being a leader of the industrial and commercial circles, with a sense of justice and backbone." Some also said, "This time I will also speak, even if I say something wrong, it will be good to vent my anger." Others said, "Zhang Naiqi can speak, and we can also speak." Thus, a small number of like-minded people passed on Zhang Naiqi's fallacies, or even snippets, to each other, finding common ground with their thoughts and feelings and taking them as allies. They even said to the industrial and commercial circles: "Zhang Naiqi spoke so well in the central government. Now we have to see if our provincial leaders will come out to speak for us this time. If they don't speak for the industrial and commercial circles like Zhang Naiqi, they are not worthy of being backbone elements." Because they were too deeply poisoned by Zhang Naiqi, they disdained to read the articles of comrades Sun Qimeng, Sun Xiaocun, Qian Jiaju, Wu Dakun, and others, and dismissed them all as "dogmatism, which cannot solve the problem." As for E'rang himself, due to his lack of ideological understanding and poor political sense, he was also harmed by Zhang Naiqi to a certain extent. Of course, there was also a part of the old consciousness in his mind at work. For example, Zhang Naiqi described the essential transformation of the national bourgeoisie as pulling out tendons and peeling off skin. I was also confused by his thoughts at the time, and I felt that what he said seemed to make sense: now that the bourgeoisie has handed over their enterprises and basically become state civil servants, they should be given more encouragement, why must the transformation be described as pulling out tendons and peeling off skin. Now we realize that, in fact, the so-called pulling out tendons and peeling off skin only describes the arduousness and thoroughness of the transformation. Only after undergoing the transformation of pulling out tendons and peeling off skin can the national bourgeois elements become laborers in the true sense of the word. E'rang also made many wrong remarks at some symposiums in Anhui that were enough to affect the thinking of the industrial and commercial circles, such as saying that the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns had side effects, that the government's actions were true ideas and false consultations, that some party members were impersonal, that private personnel generally had positions without power, and that people in the industrial and commercial circles were afraid of the backbone elements of the industrial and commercial circles, and the attitude was quite bad. Thinking back today, I really hate myself. The education received this time is profound, and I will better accept transformation in the future. For example, Zhang Dongye, chairman of the CDNCA in Hefei, said that except for 12 million party members, more than 20 million members of the Communist Youth League, and some workers, the hearts of the remaining 500 million people are filled with inferiority and depression. He also said that when speaking to the Party, one must "look at the sky early when the rooster crows" and act according to the color of the Party. He also blamed the responsibility of public and private silence on the Party's respect for scholars but lack of closeness, and impersonality. He said that scholars should be kept if they are suitable and left if they are not. Aren't these anti-Party and slanderous remarks in the same vein as Zhang Naiqi? Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks have a certain market in Anhui and Henan. The reason why it has such a market is because Zhang Naiqi seized and used the weaknesses of the industrial and commercial circles to attack. From another perspective, this also confirms that the two sides of the Chinese national bourgeoisie still exist, and the political and ideological education of the national bourgeois elements still needs to be strengthened.

Zhang Naiqi's anti-Party fallacies not only have a certain market in the industrial and commercial circles in Anhui and Henan, but also in a small number of intellectuals. Because he hangs the sign of the Seven Gentlemen, what he writes always puts the government's policy-oriented things in the front, and interspersed with anti-Party and anti-people things. If you are superficial or careless, it is difficult to see his private goods. At present, he holds an important position in the central government, and he boasts that he is highly skilled and good at deceiving people, so a small number of intellectuals are fascinated by him. Therefore, we hope that everyone will expose him as much as possible, and the newspapers should widely publicize him, and publish his crimes in time, so as to save a small number of intellectuals from falling into his trap and being harmed by him.

Zhang Naiqi Used Insidious Means to Rope in a Small Group of Backward Elements in an Attempt to Rebel

Now I want to talk about how the government is too lenient towards Zhang Naiqi, and the people trust him too much, but Zhang Naiqi is a complete and authentic heartless guy. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the People's Government and the people have not held Zhang Naiqi accountable for what he has done in the past, but have given Zhang Naiqi high positions and generous treatment, and have successively served as a member of the Government Affairs Council, a deputy to the National People's Congress, the Minister of Food, and the vice-chairman of the CDNCA and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. His lover was arranged to hold an important position in the CDNCA General Association. He not only did not repay the government's heavy trust and the people's earnest leniency, but instead was ungrateful, used his position to do unscrupulous things, and created all kinds of anti-socialist remarks that slandered the Party. His intentions were ulterior, he wanted to overthrow socialism, he wanted to pull capitalism back, and he did his best to drag patriotic industrialists and businessmen to a point of no return. Zhang Naiqi described the patriotic industrialists and businessmen's gratitude to the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the praise and cheers for the peaceful transformation of the national bourgeoisie, as "the old routine of the bourgeoisie," "it is not strange to be courteous," "singing praises," "fake positive" and so on. Zhang Naiqi believed that the strange and complaining remarks of some backward industrialists and businessmen were correct, positive, and sincere, and he seized this backward strange tune, supported it overtly, and encouraged it covertly. For example, Li Kangnian proposed that the fixed interest rate should be paid in one lump sum for twenty years. He supported Li Kangnian, saying, "This opinion is correct." Wu Jincui raised the question of whether to learn from the working class, and Zhang Naiqi supported him at any time, saying, "Wu Jincui has courage." Dong Shaochen proposed that the public representatives should be withdrawn from the joint state-private enterprises, and Zhang Naiqi believed that it was worth studying. He always supported Bi Mingqi's anti-Party remarks, saying that the opinions were consistent. Zhang Naiqi used this insidious means to rope in a small group of backward elements to be his minions, to conspire to rebel, and to win the cheers of Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan and imperialism. Zhang Naiqi, you should ask yourself, what has the Communist Party of China and the people of the whole country done to you that is wrong? What has made it difficult for you? You should say a word of conscience to the representatives of the people of the whole country, why do you have such hatred for the Party and the people? How can you be worthy of the revolutionary martyrs who crossed the snow-capped mountains and grasslands for your madness to attack the Party? How can you be worthy of the working class who are working hard to produce for the country and the people? How can you be worthy of our lively and innocent next generation? Zhang Naiqi, we still want to ask you now: you distort Chairman Mao's speech; you said that there is no difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class except for the fixed interest rate; you said that the Chinese national bourgeoisie has no two sides; you publicly publicized that the work of the Ministry of Food has positions and powers that were won through struggle; why did you ask people to look at "Looking West at Chang'an" when they wanted to marry a Communist Party member? You said that "fixed interest is not exploitation, it is unearned income"; you said that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism"; you said that the Five-Anti Campaign was the Communist Party treating the national bourgeoisie as an enemy; you said "the bourgeoisie handed over the means of production without nostalgia, which is much better than people who shout slogans and post slogans empty-handed"; you bought antiques and said you were "looking at the political situation and making economic calculations," what political situation are you looking at? You explain. We want to question you about the above fallacies: what is your motive? What is your intention? What is your attempt? You must honestly confess, otherwise we cannot tolerate it.

Zhang Naiqi, we want to tell you that in the past few years, we have been cultivated and educated by the Party, and our minds are no worse than yours. We can recognize your counterfeit coin. At most, we will be deceived by you for a while, and we will never be used by you for a long time. We are grateful for the Party's guidance, we are determined to follow the Party, accept transformation, work hard to study and work, this is the eternal happiness of our children and grandchildren, and we will never be fooled by you again, and you should not dream anymore. Zhang Naiqi, your sign is not the golden sign you imagined, but a "dirty, rotten, and smelly" one.

Zhang Naiqi, ah! We were so close, we almost ate the candy you "Zhang Ji" manufactured, which was coated with sugar on the outside and arsenic on the inside. If the Party had not pointed it out in time, our lives would have been almost lost in your hands. How can you bear it? We still sincerely tell you and all the rightists that you should hurry up and listen to Premier Zhou's words, to be thoroughly aware, sincerely bow your heads to the people, admit your sins and mistakes, and thoroughly confess, and the people of the whole country will still be lenient to you. If you still persist in your delusion and insist on opposing socialism, we will never spare you. At that time, we will pull out your tendons and peel off your skin.

### 我们险些吃了“章记”糖衣砒霜  潘锷鏱、鲁定华、傅子诚的联合发言

专栏：

    我们险些吃了“章记”糖衣砒霜
    潘锷鏱、鲁定华、傅子诚的联合发言
    我完全拥护周总理政府工作报告和完全同意李副总理、薄副总理、乌兰夫副总理、董院长、张检察长、彭副委员长的报告。
    章乃器打着七君子的迷人招牌干着反党反社会主义的勾当
    我们是中国民主建国会的会员，自从参加民建会以来将近七个年头，在这期间民建组织在党的领导下对我们教育是很大的，帮助和督促我们进行思想改造的成绩是巨大的。但是作为民建领导人之一的章乃器对我们平素不但没有给予一点教育帮助，相反地处处用阴险的手段来拖我们后腿，我们因为文化水平低，政治嗅觉差，所以在某些问题上总是上了他的阴谋的当。几年来在不知不觉中被他所写所讲的迷住了。这次在他以帮助党整风为名又大放毒素，想再一次拉我们下水，但是这个恶毒阴谋很快的被人民揭穿了。被民建中央驳斥了，从而惊醒了我们，使我们得救。我们想起章乃器过去对我们散播的阴谋毒药真是毛骨悚然。如果不是人民对他的阴谋很快揭穿，我们就有被他毒药害死的危险。因此我们衷心地感谢党，感谢人民。
    章乃器是我们工商界中特号的右派分子，他打着过去七君子招牌，做着反党反人民的罪恶勾当。解放后他伪装拥护党，私下里却大量贩卖资本主义私货，他有阴谋的计划，有恶毒的步骤，有最终目的。他利用工商界中落后分子的言论作为向党进攻的资本，并且用写信联络的办法进行对落后分子鼓励、支持，互相呼应，凡是进步工商业者他总说是假进步，凡是对政府不满的工商业者他总说是真进步，扩大他的市场，企图达到推翻社会主义，恢复资本主义的目的，他的一切所作所为是违反宪法的，是反对全国人民，是要把全国爱国工商界脱离社会主义拖到万劫不复之地。阴险毒辣，比豺狼虎豹还要恶毒十分。我们万分愤恨，我们要向全国人民控诉他。
    章乃器的谬论在安徽、河南两地的恶劣影响
    章乃器反党反人民是一贯的。抗日战争刚开始时期与宋子文、李宗仁、白崇禧等就有秘密往来。他在安徽任伪省府代秘书长兼伪财政厅厅长时候，与国民党特务也来往甚密，并且与一个姓王的女特务搞上肉体关系，做出许多不可告人之事。他在救国会工作时候曾派人送给宋子文一封用火漆封口的秘密信。当他被捕出狱以后要救国日报做“少号召、多建议”的宣传。他在汉口时候卖身投靠陈诚，居然担任了反动的三青团中央干事。解放后他伪装进步，特别自从一九五五年民建第一次全国代表大会以来，章乃器贩卖资本主义更显露骨，在庄严的大会上居然歪曲国家领袖言论，说：“中国民族资产阶级是红色资产阶级”，企图使资产阶级抗拒改造来反对工人阶级的领导。一九五六年他又否定现阶段的中国民族资产阶级还有两面性。今年他又利用帮助党整风机会，大放模糊阶级界限、否定工人阶级领导等等谬论，全国工商界不知有多少人，当吃了他的蜜汁砒霜之后，做了他的思想俘虏。自从章乃器在中央统战部召开的座谈会上发出罪大恶极谬论以后，我们安徽、河南两地部分工商界思想波动很剧烈，尤其是落后分子对他发言最感兴趣。他们说：“章乃器说话真正代表了我们，章乃器真不愧是工商界领导人物，有正义感，有骨气。”有的还说：“这次我也说话，就是说错了出口气也是好的。”也有人说：“章乃器能说，我们也能说。”于是少数气味相投的人把章乃器的谬论，甚至是片言只字在互相传观，从中找出跟他们的思想情感相通的地方，引为同调。他们甚至向工商界说：“章乃器在中央讲得这么好，现在要看我们省里领导人在这次是否给我们出来讲话了，如果不照章乃器那样地替工商界讲话，就不配做骨干分子。”由于他们中了章乃器的毒素太深了，因此，看见报上登载孙起孟、孙晓屯、千家驹、吴大琨等同志文章，他们都不屑一看，一概抹煞说：“是教条主义，不能解决问题。”说到锷鏱本人，由于思想认识不高，政治嗅觉不灵，也曾在一定程度上受到章乃器的毒害。当然自己脑海中也有一部分旧的意识作怪。比如，章乃器把民族资产阶级分子脱胎换骨的本质改造，说成是抽筋剥皮，我在思想上也曾受到他的迷惑，当时觉得他说得好像有道理：资产阶级分子今天既已交出企业，基本上成为国家的公职人员，就应该多给他们鼓励，何必一定要把改造说成脱胎换骨。现在我们认识到，其实，所谓脱胎换骨，只是形容改造的艰巨性和彻底性，民族资产阶级分子，只有经过脱胎换骨的改造，才能成为名副其实的劳动者。锷鏱在安徽的一些座谈会上还说了许多足以影响工商界思想的错误的论调。如说三反、五反有副作用啦，政府做事是真主意假商量啦，某些党员没有人情味啦，私方人员普遍存在有职无权啦，工商界人士怕工商界骨干分子啦等等，并且态度还相当不好，今天回想起真是痛恨自己。这一次受到的教育是深刻的，今后更好的来接受改造自己。又如，合肥市民建主委张东野说，全国除了一千二百万党员，二千多万团员和若干工人以外，其余五亿几千万人的心里都是感到自卑和消沉，还说对党说话要“鸡鸣早看天”，看看党的颜色行事，又说公私相对无言的责任，归罪为党对士尊而不亲，没有人情味，对士应该合则留，不合则去等反党诬党言论，这不是跟章乃器一鼻孔出气吗？章乃器的反动言论，在我们安徽、河南两地是有一定市场的，其所以有这样的市场，是因为章乃器抓住和利用了工商界的弱点，加以进攻；从另一方面看，这也是证实了中国民族资产阶级的两面性依然存在，对于民族资产阶级分子的政治思想教育，依然有加强的必要。
    章乃器的反党谬论，在安徽、河南不但在工商界中有一定市场，就是在一小部分知识分子中也有市场的。因为他挂了七君子招牌，他所写的东西，总是开头用政府政策性东西摆在前头，而内中夹杂着反党反人民的东西，假如表面或者粗心大意地就很难看出他夹杂私货。而目前他在中央任着重要职务，他夸耀自己本领又高，骗人又有一手，所以很有一小部分知识分子给他迷住。因此，我们希望大家尽量揭发，报章上要广泛宣传，将他的罪恶及时公布，以挽救一小部分知识分子免得落入他的圈套，被他陷害。
    章乃器用阴险手腕拉拢一小撮落后分子企图造反
    现在再想谈一谈政府对章乃器实在太宽大，人民对他也实在太信任了，而章乃器却是十足道地的一个没有良心的家伙。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，人民政府和人民对章乃器过去所作所为，不咎既往，而给章乃器以很高职位，优厚待遇，先后担任了政务委员、全国人民代表、粮食部部长、民建和全国工商联副主委，他的爱人安排在民建总会任要职。他对政府托付之重，人民对他殷切宽大，不但不以恩将恩报，反而忘恩负义，利用他的地位做出丧尽天良的事情，创造出种种污蔑党的反社会主义言论，居心叵测，想推翻社会主义，想把资本主义拉回头，用尽心机要把爱国工商业者拉到万劫不复之地。章乃器对爱国工商业者的感激共产党、感激人民政府，对民族资产阶级和平改造歌颂声、欢呼声，说成是“资产阶级老一套”，是“礼多人不怪”，是“歌功颂德”，是“假积极”等等。对一部分落后工商业者的怪论牢骚，章乃器认为是正确、积极的，是真心话，并且抓住这种落后怪腔怪调，明支持，暗鼓励。比如，李康年提出定息要二十年，一次付清。他就支持李康年说：“这个意见是正确的。”吴金萃提出要不要向工人阶级学习问题，章乃器随时支持他说：“吴金萃有勇气。”董少臣提出在公私合营企业中要撤出公方代表，章乃器认为值得研究。对毕鸣岐反党论调随时支持说是意见一致。章乃器就用这种阴险手腕拉拢一小撮落后分子做他虾兵蟹将，来阴谋造反，来博得台湾蒋介石和帝国主义的喝采。章乃器，你应该抚心自问，中国共产党和全国人民有哪些地方对你不起？有哪些地方给你过不去？你应该要向全国人民代表说一句良心话，你为什么对党对人民有这样仇恨。你这样丧心病狂向党进攻，你怎样对得起过雪山、越草原的革命先烈？怎样对得起出力流汗为国为民在努力生产的工人阶级？怎样对得起我们活泼天真的后一代？章乃器我们现在还要问问你：你歪曲毛主席讲话；你说资产阶级与工人阶级除了定息以外，并没有什么区别了；你说中国民族资产阶级没有两面性了；你公开宣传粮食部工作有职有权是斗争得来的；人家要嫁给一个共产党员，为什么你要人家看看“西望长安”？你说“定息不是剥削，是不劳而获”；你说“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”；你说五反是共产党把民族资产阶级当作敌人看待；你说
  “资产阶级交出生产资料没有留恋，比赤手空拳喊喊口号，贴贴标语的人好得多了”；你买进古董说是“看看政治行情，打打经济算盘”，你看什么政治行情？你说明。以上这些谬论我们要质问你：你的动机是什么？用意何在？企图是什么？你要老老实实地坦白交代，否则我们是不能容忍的。
    章乃器，我们要告诉你，几年来我们承蒙党的培养教育，我们头脑不比你差，我们能识别你这块夹铜洋钿啦，我们至多给你蒙蔽一时，决不会给你长期利用。我们感激党的引导，我们坚决跟党走，接受改造努力学习、工作，这是我们子子孙孙的永远幸福，永远再也不会上你的当了，你也再不要梦想了。章乃器，你这块招牌不是像你自己想像的金字招牌了，而是一块“脏、烂、臭”了。
    章乃器呵！我们好险呀，险些儿吃了你“章记”制造的外包糖衣内藏砒霜的糖果，如果不是党及时指出，我们的生命险乎断送在你手里，你于心何忍？我们现在还是诚恳告诉你和一切右派分子，你们赶快听周总理话，要彻底觉悟，诚心地向人民低头认罪认错，彻底坦白交代，全国人民还是对你宽大的。如果你仍执迷不悟，坚持反对社会主义，我们是决不会饶你的，到那时候，我们是要抽你的筋，剥你的皮了。
