    Lugou Bridge Sketches
    Li Xiao

    Twenty years have passed like fleeting clouds, but Lugou Bridge remains the same.

    The sky above Lugou Bridge is still a seamless expanse of blue. Below the bridge, the Yongding River still flows slowly through the arches, but the water has become clearer and more crystalline, with schools of fish clearly visible. Looking southwest, across the wide riverbed and plain, one can see the factories and chimneys of Changxindian; looking north, the Western Hills are still faintly visible, like a painter's delicate stroke of ink between the water and the sky.

    However, when those of us who grew up in the flames of the Anti-Japanese War come to the Lugou Bridge twenty years later, how can this picturesque scenery calm our hearts? Gazing at the surging river, silently counting the stone lions at the bridgehead, how can we stop the events of the past twenty years from surging into our minds like the Yongding River?

    At this moment, it is already midday. Lugou Bridge is bathed in bright sunlight. Even the stone lions on the bridge seem to be fast asleep. Only in the green fields on both sides of the bridge, some working figures are occasionally visible, and sometimes the southern breeze carries a few songs, breaking the silence around.

    Occasionally, a long train passes over the iron bridge that runs parallel to Lugou Bridge. In those days, this iron bridge was occupied by Japanese soldiers, who recklessly fired guns and cannons at Lugou Bridge and Wanping City; today, trains carrying thousands of passengers, timber, coal, and so on, pass smoothly over it!

    Occasionally, someone drives a cart across the bridge, the donkey's hooves clattering against the stones. The cart is loaded with red bricks and lime for building houses. The old villager is reluctant to take a break, urging the little donkey to hurry towards the construction site.

    Occasionally, one or two people carrying a load of katydids pass by. They rest at a small teahouse at the east end of the bridge. The katydids' crisp chirping awakens the people resting in the street. Adults poke their heads out to see if it is time to go back to work; children run over, their eyes wide, listening attentively to the little insects' cheerful songs.

    On the road leading to Lugou Bridge, the township secretary rides his bicycle home for lunch. This young man, who grew up by Lugou Bridge, like all the people of Lugou Bridge, heard the first shot fired by the Japanese devils, experienced the days of bloody war, and endured the dark eight years and the equally difficult years after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Until Beijing was liberated, he joined the army and followed the army south, all the way to the South China Sea. Then he returned to civilian life and came back to the Lugou Bridge where he grew up.

    If the Lugou Bridge in our memory is still connected to the gunfire of national liberation, then the colorful scene of life before our eyes has become a cheerful movement in the symphony of our socialist construction, hasn't it?

    Yes, Lugou Bridge is like a kind and stern old man, a witness to a history of suffering. Listen to these stories: Right under the imperial pavilion west of the bridge, thirteen strong men were stabbed to death by Japanese soldiers with bayonets, their blood staining the green grass and the stones red. A rickshaw puller passing over the bridge was forced by Japanese soldiers to stand on a stone lion, preparing to use him as a target for shooting practice. People's lives struggled in hunger and disease, carved and mutilated by the guns and knives of the Japanese devils. Corpses were constantly thrown from the city walls to the outside – where wild dogs were drooling, their tongues blood red. These bloody events are clearly remembered by the elderly people of Lugou Bridge, clearly remembered by the young people, and the children will remember them as well. Because, whenever they are picky and pout in a fit of temper, the older generation will tell them stories of the past, warning them not to be unaware of the blessings they enjoy.

    Lugou Bridge, you are also a witness to a happy life!

    On the wall of the township people's committee office, we saw several award banners, which show that the people of Lugou Bridge township have made great achievements in the project of diverting the Yongding River water and dredging the Feng River, in the literacy campaign, and in mass cultural activities. The hard work of the people of Lugou Bridge is worthy of this heroic land. More than four hundred and sixty peasant households in the township have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. The township head stretched out his hands for us to see, the calloused hands were already red and swollen, but he said casually: "It's nothing, I still have to rush to harvest wheat tonight."

    …The summer evening came to Lugou Bridge, and the production team members returned from the fields. They, men and women, chatted and laughed, opening their clothes as they walked to let the evening breeze dry their sweat; some held popsicles, crossing the bridge in groups of three or five.

    The afterglow of the setting sun on the Western Hills gradually faded. In the northwest of the bridge, in the depths of the twilight, a large spark bursts out. Someone said that it was the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, and about another furnace of iron has been produced.

    Lugou Bridge, can you tell us: What beautiful scenery will there be in another twenty years? On that day, we will definitely come to see you again…

    芦沟桥散笔
    李效
    二十年如同过眼云烟，芦沟桥依然是当年的芦沟桥。
    芦沟桥的上空，依然是浑然一色蔚蓝。桥下面，永定河水依然缓缓地流过桥洞，只是河水变得澄澈和晶莹，游鱼历历可数。向西南望，越过宽阔的河床和平野，能看到长辛店的厂房和烟囱；向北望，西山依然隐隐约约，像画家在水天之间涂上一抹绰约有致的黛痕。
    然而，当我们这群在抗日的烽火中长大起来的人，二十年后来到芦沟桥头的时候，这如画的风光又怎能使我们的心情宁静？凝视着滔滔的河水，默数着桥头的石狮子，我们又怎能遏阻二十年的往事像永定河水似地一齐涌上心头？
    此刻，已是晌午时分。芦沟桥沐浴在明灿的阳光里。连桥上的石狮子，也似乎酣然入梦了。只有桥两岸碧绿的庄稼地里，不时露出一些劳动着的人影，有时南风还吹来几声小唱，打破四周的宁静。
    偶尔，和芦沟桥并列着的铁桥上，驰过一长列火车。当年，这铁桥曾被日本兵占据，肆无忌惮地朝芦沟桥、朝宛平城开枪放炮；今天，列车载着成千旅客、载着木材、黑煤等等，从上面平平稳稳地驶过！
    偶尔，有人赶着大车从桥上走过，驴蹄敲打着石块得得作响。大车上装着修筑房屋的红砖、石灰。赶车的老乡舍不得歇一口气，赶着小毛驴朝建筑工地奔走。
    偶尔，一两个挑着一担蝈蝈儿的人从这里经过。他们在桥东头的小茶馆里歇了下来。蝈蝈儿的清脆的鸣声，惊醒了街头歇凉的人们。大人们探出头来，看看是不是已经到了又该劳动的时候；孩子们跑了拢来，睁着大眼睛，谛听着这小虫子的欢歌。
    在通往芦沟桥的大路上，乡秘书骑着自行车回家吃午饭去了。这个在芦沟桥畔长大的年青人，同所有的芦沟桥人一样，亲耳听到过日本鬼子的第一声炮声，经历过血火纷飞的日子，度过黯淡的八年和抗日战争胜利后的同样苦难的岁月。直到北京解放，他参了军，随着大军南下，走到南海边。然后复员回来，回到生长他的芦沟桥边。
    如果说，记忆里的芦沟桥还是跟民族解放的炮声连在一起；那么，眼前的这幅彩色的生活画，岂不成为我们的社会主义建设的交响乐中的一个轻快的乐句么？
    是的，芦沟桥像个慈祥而又严峻的老人，是苦难的历史的见证人。请听听下面这些故事吧：就在桥西皇亭下，十三个身强力壮的汉子被日本兵用刺刀戳死，鲜血染红了青草，染红了石头。一个洋车夫从桥上经过，日本兵却强迫他站到石狮子上，准备把他当作靶子打枪嬉乐。人们的生命在饥饿和疾病里挣扎着，在日本鬼子的枪刀尖上雕残着。死尸，不断地从城头抛到城外去——那儿，野狗正吐露着血红的舌头。这些血淋淋的事迹，芦沟桥乡的老年人记得清楚，年青人记得清楚，而且，孩子们也会记得清楚。因为，每当他们挑三拣四噘着小嘴发脾气的时候，老一辈的人便会诉说着往事，告诫他们别身在福中不知福。
    芦沟桥，你也是幸福生活的见证人！
    在乡人民委员会办公室的墙上，我们看到了好几面奖旗，它们显示出芦沟桥乡的人民在引永定河水、疏浚凤河的工程中，在扫盲工作中，在群众文化活动方面，都做出了很好的成绩。芦沟桥畔人民的辛勤的劳动，无愧于英雄的土地。全乡四百六十多户农民都参加了农业生产合作社。乡长把他的双手伸开给我们看，布满了茧疤的手已经红肿了，但是他却毫不在意地说：“没有什么，晚上还得赶收麦子哩。”
    ……夏日的黄昏来到了芦沟桥头，生产队员们从地里回来了。他们和她们，有的谈笑着，一面走一面敞开衣襟，让晚风吹干汗水；有的含着冰棍，三五成群地过桥来。
    西山上面的一抹晚霞，渐渐地淡了。在桥的西北边，在暮霭深处，散出一大朵火花，有人说，那是石景山钢铁厂，大约又出一炉铁了。
    芦沟桥，你能不能告诉我们：再过二十年，又会是怎样美丽的情景呢？那一天，我们一定再来看你……
