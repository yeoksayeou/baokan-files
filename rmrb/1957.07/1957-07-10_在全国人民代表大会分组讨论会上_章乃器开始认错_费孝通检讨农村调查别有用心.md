Xinhua News Agency, July 9th: The Fourth Session of the National People's Congress held group discussions this morning, continuing to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of bourgeois right-wingers. Some representative groups continued to discuss the government's work reports.

At the Sichuan Province representative group meeting today, Zhang Naiqi, in his self-criticism, categorized himself as a so-called leftist figure. He said that some of his remarks were "easily exploited by right-wing elements." He stated: "Placing me among the right-wing, under the label of anti-Party and anti-socialist, deprives the anti-rightist struggle of someone who could play a role." He asked, "Why not mobilize this strength of mine?" (His words elicited laughter).

Zhang Naiqi also said, "After eight years, I believe that even those with minds full of bourgeois thoughts can still follow the socialist path." Therefore, he has always believed that he "only has bourgeois individualistic thinking and is definitely not politically anti-Party or anti-socialist." He described himself as a "lofty person who is not interested in politics and does not associate with others."

In his self-criticism, Zhang Naiqi said that after studying Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report, he had "a new understanding" of his past remarks. He now believes that "the fixed interest taken by capitalists is exploitation," negating his original statement that "fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income." He further stated that "there is an essential difference between national bourgeoisie and working-class elements from the perspective of exploitation and anti-exploitation." He negated his original statement that "there is no essential difference between national bourgeoisie and working-class elements." He said that his statement that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism" did not imply that "socialism inevitably leads to bureaucracy." In his view, this statement was "easily exploited by right-wing elements," so he negated the statement that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism."

At the Anhui Province representative group meeting, Zhu Yunshan, Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said that Zhang Bojun's political ambition was very large. Once, Li Shijun, vice chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, came to Beijing, and Zhang Bojun invited him to his home for dinner. At that time, Zhang Bojun spoke at length to Li Shijun about his bicameral system and other issues. Li Shijun asked Zhang Bojun, "What does the bicameral system mean?" Zhang Bojun said, "You people are really confused; the situation is developing." Li Shijun then said, "China's current system is stipulated by the Constitution." Zhang Bojun replied, "The Constitution can also be amended." Zhu Yunshan said that Zhang Bojun's political ambition could be clearly seen from this conversation.

Fei Xiaotong said at the Jiangsu Province representative group meeting today that his so-called rural survey conducted in Kai Xian Township, Zhenze District, Wujiang County, this spring, taking advantage of his inspection trip to Jiangsu, was "essentially a political activity." He said that his rural survey material was intended to be published by a publishing company in the United Kingdom. In this survey, he said he "raised questions and suggestions from a bourgeois standpoint, which in essence was to more forcefully oppose the Party's policies." Some suggestions were "tantamount to provoking the relationship between peasants and the Party." In April and May, he also ignited points in Suzhou and Wuxi, convening several symposiums for members of the China Democratic League in middle schools, urging them to speak out freely.

Fei Xiaotong said he attempted to use "New Observer" magazine to expand his influence. He said, "Some of the reporters at New Observer are my students, and I wanted to use the invitation from New Observer to open up a field to expand the influence of my thoughts." On June 10th, he wanted to write an article for New Observer entitled "Speakers are Innocent, Mistakes Must Be Corrected." He said that New Observer was influenced by him and should be examined.

Fei Xiaotong also talked about the following: On the evening of June 11th, Fei went to Chu Anping's house to see him and talked about Chu's "Party-dominated World" speech. Chu Anping said at the time: "The words have already been said, and there will be people who agree with me." Chu also took out a stack of letters and said: "These people all agree with me."

On June 6th, Fei Xiaotong, at the invitation of Pu Xixiu, made a statement to Ye Gang, a reporter from the Shanghai "Wen Hui Bao." Fei Xiaotong said that, in retrospect, the content of this conversation was essentially the same as the questions raised by Chu Anping in his "Party-dominated World" speech. He said that this conversation proved that his conspiracy with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji was completely consistent. He only asked Pu Xixiu not to publish it after seeing the People's Daily editorial on June 8th.

Zhang Yunchuan stated in his self-criticism at the Henan representative group meeting that he still has "resistance factors" and a "sojourner mentality" towards the Party deep in his mind. Zhang Yunchuan said that since liberation, he has often been dissatisfied with the Party and has said many anti-Party things, sometimes expressing it very seriously, "even seeming to hate the Communist Party." He said that although the wording of his reactionary remarks was different from that of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, in essence, he was ideologically and politically consistent with Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji.

Zhang Yunchuan said that the root of his anti-Party and anti-socialist thinking was: first, his position was that of the landlord class; second, he said that he had engaged in the third line for more than 20 years, and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party after liberation was the general trend, but deep down he still harbored some "resistance factors" and a "sojourner mentality"; third, he had many bourgeois ideas about fame and position.

Tang Shengzhi, Vice Governor of Hunan Province, exposed the facts of Pan Guangdan and others instigating ethnic relations in the Hunan region at the Hunan Province representative group meeting. Tang Shengzhi said that Pan Guangdan colluded with individual intellectuals of the Tujia ethnic group in Hunan, spreading rumors that the government did not recognize the Tujia as an ethnic group, thereby provoking ethnic relations. Democratic parties and representatives from all walks of life in Hunan Province organized a Tujia visiting group to visit four counties inhabited by the Tujia people, including Longshan and Yongshun. They visited 114 townships and 186 agricultural production cooperatives, and held more than 1,000 various types of symposiums. They learned that the Tujia had long existed as an ethnic group, that the Tujia and other ethnic groups got along very well, and that the vast majority of the Tujia people advocated the establishment of a joint autonomous region. This exposed the right-wing elements' conspiracy to instigate division.

Some representatives from the Shandong Province representative group today put forward opinions on solving the clothing problem for 600 million people, and representatives from Shaanxi Province raised opinions on implementing the Marriage Law.

### 在全国人民代表大会分组讨论会上  章乃器开始认错  费孝通检讨农村调查别有用心

    在全国人民代表大会分组讨论会上
    章乃器开始认错
    费孝通检讨农村调查别有用心
    据新华社9日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天上午分组讨论，继续揭露和批判资产阶级右派分子的反动言行。有些代表小组继续讨论了政府各项工作报告。
    章乃器今天在四川省代表小组会上作检讨的时候，把他自己列为所谓左派人物。他说，他有些言论“容易被右派分子所利用”。他说：“这次把我摆在右派里，在反党反社会主义的帽子下面，失去了一个在反右派斗争中能起作用的人。”他说：“为什么不动员我这份力量呢？”（他的话引起了笑声）。
    章乃器还说，“经过八年，我认为就是有满脑子资产阶级思想的人，仍然可以走社会主义道路。”因此，他始终认为，他“只是有资产阶级个人主义思想，政治上决不是反党反社会主义的”。他把他自己说成是一个“对政治不感兴趣的不同流合污的孤高的人”。
    章乃器在检讨中说，他学习了毛主席的讲话、周总理的报告以后，对自己过去的言论“有了新的认识”。现在他认为“资本家所拿的定息是剥削”，他否定原来说的“定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获的收入”的说法。他又说，“民族资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子从剥削与反剥削来看，是有本质的区别的”。他否定原来说的“民族资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子已经没有本质的区别”的说法。他说，他提出的“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”的说法，并没有“社会主义必然带来官僚主义”的意思，照他看来，这种说法只是“容易被右派分子所利用”，因此他否定“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”的说法。
    在安徽省代表小组会上，民革中央常务委员朱蕴山说，章伯钧的政治野心是很大的，有一次民革江苏省委员会副主任委员李世军到北京来，章伯钧曾请他到家里吃饭。当时，章伯钧向李世军大谈其两院制等问题。李世军问章伯钧：“两院制是什么意思”？章伯钧说：“你们这些人真胡涂，局势是发展的”。李世军又说：“中国的现行制度是宪法规定的”。章伯钧回答说：“宪法也可以修改”。朱蕴山说，从章伯钧的这次谈话中，可以清楚地看出章伯钧的政治野心。
    费孝通今天在江苏省代表小组会上说，今年春天，他利用去江苏视察机会，在吴江县震泽区开弦乡进行的所谓农村调查，“实质上是一种政治活动”。他说，他的这个农村调查材料，是准备送到英国一家出版公司去出版的。在这个调查中，他说他“从资产阶级立场来提出问题和建议，实质上是要更有力的反对党的政策。”有的建议“等于是在农民面前挑拨他们和党的关系”。他4、5月间，还曾在苏州、无锡两地基层点火，召开了几次中学盟员座谈会，要他们大鸣大放。
    费孝通说他企图利用“新观察”杂志来扩大他的影响。他说：“新观察记者中有我的学生，我想利用新观察约稿的关系，开拓一个扩大我思想影响的园地。”6月10日，他曾经想给新观察写一篇题为“言者无罪，有错必改”的文章。他说，新观察受了他的影响，应该检查。
    费孝通还谈到这样一些事情：6月11日晚上，费到储安平家去看他，谈到储的“党天下”的发言，储安平当时曾说：“话已经说了，有群众会同意我的”。储还拿出一叠信来说：“这些人都赞成我。”
    6月6日，费孝通应浦熙修之约，向上海“文汇报”记者叶冈发表了一篇谈话。费孝通说，现在看来，这篇谈话的内容，实质上就是储安平在“党天下”发言里提出的问题。他说，这篇谈话证明，他和章伯钧、罗隆基的阴谋是完全相合的。他因为看到6月8日人民日报社论，才要浦熙修不要把它发表。
    张云川在河南代表小组检讨说，他思想深处至今对党还有“抗拒因素”和“作客思想”。张云川说，自解放以来，他对党常常心怀不满，说了很多反党的话，有时表现很严重，“甚至看来是仇恨共产党的”。他说，他的反动言论所用的辞句尽管与章伯钧罗隆基有所不同，实质上与章伯钧罗隆基在思想上和政治上是一致的。
    张云川说，他的反党反社会主义思想根源是：首先，他的立场是地主阶级立场；其次，他说他搞了二十多年的第三条路线，解放以后接受共产党的领导是大势所趋，而思想深处还藏有一些“抗拒因素”和“作客思想”；第三，他有不少资产阶级的名位思想。
    湖南省副省长唐生智在湖南省代表小组会上揭发了潘光旦等挑拨湖南地区民族关系的事实。唐生智说，潘光旦和湖南土家族个别知识分子串通一气，到处扬言说政府不承认土家族是个民族，挑拨民族关系。湖南省各民主党派和各界代表曾为此问题组织了土家族访问团，到土家族居住的龙山、永顺等四县访问，共访问了一百一十四个乡镇、一百八十六个农业生产合作社，召开一千多次各种类型的座谈会，了解到土家族早就作为一个民族而存在，土家族和其他民族相处得很好，绝大多数土家族人民主张成立联合自治区，这就揭穿了右派分子的挑拨阴谋。
    山东省代表小组的一些代表今天就解决六亿人民的穿衣问题、陕西省代表对贯彻婚姻法问题提出了意见。
