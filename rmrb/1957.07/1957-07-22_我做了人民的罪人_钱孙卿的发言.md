Since liberation, especially during this rectification movement, I have committed extremely serious errors. After everyone's criticism and help, I have initially realized that my errors are of an anti-Party, anti-socialist nature. I have made a preliminary written self-criticism to Jiangsu Province, and I plan to continue to accept the help of the masses after returning to the province, to thoroughly confess my problems. Now, I sincerely confess my mistakes to the people of the whole country, admitting that I have become a sinner of the people.

The people of Jiangsu Province have refuted and criticized my past anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks. Currently, my old friends and children have all drawn a clear ideological line with me, but they are still seizing the opportunity to rescue me. I now see clearly that I am in an isolated position, already standing on the edge of breaking away from the industrial and commercial circles and the ranks of the people. Due to my past words and deeds, which have been consistently reactionary, I have brought very bad political influence and harm to the Party and the people. I thank everyone for their help, which has enabled me to open my eyes and recognize that socialism is the only direction and way out for our people and industrial and commercial circles. This shows that everyone is trying to save me from sinking deeper into the quagmire of a reactionary position, unable to extricate myself, and cutting myself off from the people.

Since liberation, the Party and the government have given me great trust and have not mistreated me in any way. They have taken special care and provided preferential treatment to me and my children, arranging appropriate jobs for all of us. I became a National People's Congress representative, Chairman of the Jiangsu Federation of Industry and Commerce, Vice Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and a member of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee. I should have loyally relied on the Party and the government, better reformed myself, and better served the people. Only in this way could I live up to the trust and care of the Party and the government. On the contrary, I even issued anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies, truly failing the Party and the people.

After listening to Premier Zhou's report, the facts prove that our country's socialist construction achievements are brilliant and major, while the shortcomings are individual and minor. This is entirely in line with objective reality. Taking the disaster relief work in Jiangsu Province as an example, the disaster situation in Jiangsu Province last year was very serious. In the past, under reactionary rule, it would inevitably have caused great losses and chaos. However, under the leadership of the Central Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, the people of the whole province were mobilized to carry out disaster relief and completely overcame this serious disaster. The social order was stable. I personally experienced these facts. Without the leadership of the Party, it would have been impossible to overcome such serious and arduous difficulties. In the past, I just didn't look at the achievements, only looked at the shortcomings, and exaggerated them, so I made a huge mistake. In this struggle against right-wing elements, I can see more clearly that the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, are united and resolutely opposed to any words and deeds that are detrimental to socialism. Now, right-wing elements have been forced to surrender to the people one after another, achieving brilliant results. Therefore, if I do not awaken and repent, listen to Chairman Mao, and follow the Communist Party, all that lies before me is a dead end.

I am an old intellectual from a landlord family. For decades, I have been an agent serving the exploitation interests of the bourgeoisie. After liberation, although I also participated in the past major movements, I just went through the motions. The ideological education I received was not deep or thorough enough. Emotionally and ideologically, I still resisted reform. Therefore, my old ideas were not shaken, and I did not consciously accept reform well. My view of things has not fundamentally changed. Such bad ideas have accumulated deeper and deeper, and when they are exposed, they cause serious errors, even to the point of opposing the Party and the working class. In the past, I always thought I represented the "interests of the local people" and the "legitimate interests of the industrial and commercial circles." Today, measuring it against the standards of socialism, what I represent is only the illegal interests of a small group of feudal landlords and backward industrial and commercial circles. From such a wrong perspective, I cannot see the positive role of the past major movements. For example, in the land reform movement, I had absurd views such as "landlords in southern Jiangsu are different from the big landlords in northern Jiangsu" and "is the land reform movement too excessive?" In the "Five-Anti" movement, not only did I not invest myself well in the movement, but I also spoke up for the arrested奸商 (profiteers). In the "Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries" and "Eliminating Hidden Counter-revolutionaries" movements, I saw some people I used to be familiar with being suppressed, and I was dissatisfied with these movements. Therefore, in this "Blooming and Contending," I put forward fallacies such as "officials have laws, but the people do not" and "the constitution is abandoned as soon as a movement comes" to attack the Party. This statement is inconsistent with the facts. The constitution of our country is a constitution that protects the people and seeks happiness for the people. Because I only want to protect the so-called legitimate interests of the declining class, I cannot see the constitution. I even forgot that I was entrusted by the people to raise my hand and pass the constitution supported by the people. At the recent symposium of industrial and commercial circles across the country, I continued to spread anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies. All of this proves that the remnants of my reactionary thoughts are very intense. I have always stood on the position of the declining class and the bourgeoisie who resist reform, acting as a spokesman for reactionary elements, landlords, and profiteers, even failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, unable to see the reactionary nature of these people, indulging the negative and backward aspects of my own thoughts, and failing to restrain myself, thereby bringing serious losses to the cause of the Party and the people. This is my most unforgivable mistake in recent years.

I also examined that my past work in the Jiangsu Federation of Industry and Commerce was also passive. The hope of the people and industrial and commercial circles for me was that I should play a positive leading role in assisting the Party and the government in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and accept transformation together with bourgeois elements, smoothly entering socialist society. Because my thinking represented the backward and negative side of the bourgeoisie, and I did not see that accepting transformation was the biggest and most fundamental interest of the industrial and commercial circles, therefore, in my work in the Federation of Industry and Commerce, I emphasized that the Federation of Industry and Commerce should not become a "errand-running" organization, and that it should not be separated from the masses. This was tantamount to wanting the Federation of Industry and Commerce to take the path of separating from the leadership of the Party and the working class, to encourage some backward industrialists and merchants to passively resist socialist transformation. In the past, I thought that this would prevent me from being separated from the "masses" of industrial and commercial circles. In fact, this practice precisely harmed the most fundamental interests of the industrial and commercial circles. All patriotic and conscious industrial and commercial circles have risen up to oppose it and will never allow anyone to confuse them and embark on the path of being anti-Party and anti-socialist. Now, I am truly separated from the masses of industrial and commercial circles. My absurd words and deeds have great harmfulness, affecting the enthusiasm of socialist transformation in the industrial and commercial circles of Jiangsu Province. I should not evade the serious responsibility that I should bear.

At the symposium of industrial and commercial circles across the country, I heard Minister Li Weihan put forward in his concluding remarks that the problem of small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants should be dealt with appropriately and has been handed over to a special group for research. This shows the serious attitude of the Party in rectifying while correcting. The struggle of the Democratic National Construction Association Central Committee and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce to criticize the reactionary remarks of right-wing element Zhang Naiqi had a great educational significance for me, opening my eyes and recognizing the harmfulness of my past reactionary remarks. Now, Chairman Mao teaches us and Premier Zhou clearly pointed out in the government work report that the struggle against the right-wing is a struggle between two lines, and explained that if right-wing elements can awaken and repent and accept transformation, the door of socialist transformation is open to them. If they persist in their reactionary stance, resist transformation, and even take actions to sabotage socialist construction, then they will cut themselves off from the people. I have now realized that I have made serious mistakes in the past and have embarked on the reactionary path of being anti-Party and anti-socialist. I now sincerely accept everyone's criticism, confess to the people of the whole country that I am a sinner of the people, bow my head to the people and confess my guilt, and resolutely guarantee to the people of the whole country that I am determined to completely eliminate the bad things of my past reactionary thoughts, so that I can stand on the socialist position, loyally accept the leadership of the Party and the working class, transform myself in the cause of socialist transformation and socialist construction, play my due role, redeem myself, and repay the Party and the people of the whole country for their expectations and forgiveness.

    我做了人民的罪人
    钱孙卿的发言
    解放几年来，特别在这次整风运动中，我犯下了极其严重的错误。经过大家批判和帮助，我初步认识到自己的错误是属于反党、反社会主义的性质的，已初步向江苏省作出书面检查，回省后，还准备继续接受群众的帮助，彻底交代自己的问题，现在真心诚意地向全国人民承认自己错误，承认自己做了人民的罪人。
    这次江苏省全省人民对我过去反党和反社会主义言论进行了驳斥和批判，目前我的老朋友和儿女都与我划清思想界限，但他们还都抓紧机会对我进行抢救。我现在看清楚自己已经处于孤立地位，已经站在脱离工商界和人民的队伍的边缘，由于我过去的言行，一贯地是反动的，对于党和人民带来了很坏的政治影响和危害，我感谢大家对我的帮助，使我能够张开了眼睛，认清了社会主义是我们全国人民和工商界的唯一的方向和出路，说明大家是在挽救我，不要更深地陷进反动立场的泥坑，不能自拔，自绝于人民。
    解放几年来，党和政府给我很大的信任，一点也没有亏待我，对我和我的儿女特别照顾和优待，都安排了适当的工作，我就做了全国人民代表、江苏工商联主委、江苏省政协副主席、江苏省人民委员会委员，就应该忠诚地依靠党和政府，更好地改造自己，更好地为人民服务，这样做才不辜负党和政府对我的信任和照顾。恰恰相反，我竟然发出反党、反社会主义的谬论，真是对不起党、对不起人民。
    我听了周总理的报告，事实证明了我国社会主义建设成就是辉煌的、主要的，缺点是个别的，这完全是符合客观情况的，就以江苏省救灾工作来看，在去年江苏省的灾情是非常严重的，如在过去反动统治下，必然会造成很大的损失、混乱，而在中央和江苏省省委领导下，发动全省人民进行救灾，完全战胜了这个严重的灾荒，社会秩序是平稳的。这些事实也是我亲身体会到，没有党的领导，不可能克服这样严重的、艰巨的困难。过去我就是不看成就，只看缺点，而且夸大它，所以犯了天大的错误。在这次反右派分子斗争中，我更清楚地看到全国人民在党的领导下，团结一致的、坚决反对不利于社会主义的任何言行活动，现在已迫使右派分子纷纷向人民投降，取得了辉煌的战果。所以我如再不憣然悔悟，听毛主席的话，跟共产党走，在我面前的只是一条死胡同。
    我是一个旧知识分子，地主家庭出身的，我几十年来一直是为资产阶级的剥削利益服务的代理人，解放后，虽然也参加了历次的大运动，但都是应付过关，所受的思想教育不深不透，在情绪上和思想上还是抗拒改造的。因此对于旧思想没有受到震动而自觉地很好地接受改造。对于事物的看法，没有从根本上改变，这样的坏思想，愈积愈深，暴露出来，就造成严重的错误，甚至发展到与党和工人阶级对立的地步，我过去一直以为代表“地方人民利益”代表“工商界合法利益”，今天拿社会主义的准则衡量一下，我所代表的只是一小撮封建地主和落后工商界的不法利益，从这样一个错误的角度上看问题，就看不到历次大运动的积极作用，如在土改运动中，我有“苏南地主不同于苏北的大地主”“土改运动是不是太过火”等荒谬的看法，在“五反”运动中，我不但没有很好的投入运动中去，反而为被捕的奸商喊冤，在“镇反”、“肃反”运动中，我看到过去和我熟悉的一些人被镇压了，就不满意这些运动，因此在这次“鸣、放”中，提出了“官有法”“民无法”，“运动一来就丢掉了宪法”的谬论来攻击党，这个说法是和事实不符的，我们国家的宪法是保护人民和为人民谋幸福的宪法，因为我只想保护没落阶级的所谓合法利益，就看不到宪法。甚至我忘记了受人民委托，举手通过人民所拥护的宪法，在最近举行的全国工商界座谈会上我仍然散布反党、反社会主义的谬论。所有这些，在在证明我的反动思想残余，十分炽烈，一直站在没落阶级和抗拒改造的资产阶级的立场，做了反动分子和地主、奸商的代言人，竟至敌我不分，看不到这些人的反动本质，放纵自己思想消极落后的一面，不加克制，从而给党和人民的事业带来了严重的损失，这是我几年来最不可饶恕的错误。
    我检查过去在江苏省工商联工作也是消极的，人民和工商界对我的希望，是在协助党和政府对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造中应起积极带头作用，和资产阶级分子一起接受改造，平平稳稳地走入社会主义社会。由于我的思想上代表了资产阶级的落后消极一面，没有看到接受改造是工商界最大的最根本的利益，因此我在工商联工作中，强调工商联不要变成“办差”机构，脱离了群众，这无异要工商联走上脱离党和工人阶级领导的方向，来鼓励部分落后的工商业者，消极对抗社会主义改造，过去我自己认为这样可以不脱离工商界“群众”，事实上，这样的做法，恰恰是损害了工商界最根本的利益，全体爱国有觉悟的工商界已经群起反对，决不允许任何人迷惑他们走上反党反社会主义的道路，现在我是真正的脱离了工商界群众。我的荒谬言行有很大的危害性，影响了江苏省工商界社会主义改造的积极性，不应该诿卸应由我来负的严重责任。
    我在全国工商界座谈会上听到李维汉部长在总结发言中提出关于中小工商业者的问题，应当寻求适当的处理办法，已交专门小组研究，这已说明了党边整边改的认真态度，民建中央和全国工商联对于批判右派分子章乃器反动言论的斗争，对我是有很大的教育意义，使我睁开了眼睛，认识了过去反动言论的危害性。现在毛主席教导我们及周总理在政府工作报告中明确指出反对右派的斗争是二条路线的斗争，并说明右派分子能够憣然悔悟，接受改造，社会主义改造大门对他们是开着的，如坚持反动立场，抗拒改造，甚至采取破坏社会主义建设的行动，那么，他们就将自绝于人民，我现在已认识到过去犯了严重错误，已走上反党、反社会主义的反动道路，我现在诚心诚意接受大家的批判，向全国人民承认自己是人民的罪人，向人民低头认罪，并坚决向全国人民保证自己有决心将过去反动思想的坏东西，全部清除出去，使自己站到社会主义的立场上来，忠诚接受党和工人阶级的领导，在社会主义改造和社会主义建设的事业中改造自己，发挥应有的作用，立功赎罪，来报答党和全国人民对我的期望和饶恕。
