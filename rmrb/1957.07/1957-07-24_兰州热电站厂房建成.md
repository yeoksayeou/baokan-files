Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 23rd: The factory building of the modern Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant has recently been completed. Some of the generators and boilers inside the factory building have also been installed and are undergoing partial trial operation.

The construction of this plant began in December 1955, and both the design and construction were carried out with the help of Soviet experts. The advanced experience of Soviet large-scale combined installation was adopted in the equipment installation, which shortened the installation time. Now, according to the initial assessment of relevant technical personnel and Soviet experts, the project quality and installation quality meet the standards, and most of them are rated as first-class.

Lanzhou City currently has only one power plant, which cannot meet the growing electricity needs of industrial construction. After this plant is put into operation, in addition to fully supplying electricity, hot water, and steam to large industrial enterprises in the Lanzhou area, it can also supply electricity to Yongdeng Cement Plant and Baiyin City.

    兰州热电站厂房建成
    据新华社兰州23日电　现代化的兰州热电站的厂房工程最近已经建成。厂房内的部分发电机和锅炉也安装好了，正进行部分试运转。
    这个厂1955年12月开工兴建，从设计到施工都是在苏联专家帮助下进行的。在设备安装中采取苏联的大组合安装的先进经验，缩短了安装时间。现在，根据有关技术人员和苏联专家的初步鉴定，认为工程质量和安装质量合乎标准，并且大部分属于甲等。
    兰州市现在仅有一座发电厂，不能满足工业建设日益增长的用电需要。这个厂投入生产后，除充分供给兰州地区大工业企业的电、热水和蒸气外，还可供应永登水泥厂和白银市的用电。
