    Liaoning's State-Owned and Locally State-Owned Industries
    Fulfill Five-Year Total Output Value Plan Ahead of Schedule
    1957 Total Industrial Output Value More Than Three Times the Highest Level Before Liberation
    (Our newspaper, Shenyang, 10th) Reporter Jin Yukun reports: Liaoning Province, which produces two-thirds of the country's steel, one-third of its machinery industrial products, and most of its synthetic petroleum, completed the accumulated total output value of the First Five-Year Plan for industry in early July, ahead of schedule. The industrial production level required by the Five-Year Plan was achieved at the end of October last year. According to the actual performance of the previous four years and this year's plan, state-owned and local state-owned enterprises in the province have accumulated a total of 10.3 billion yuan for the state during the five years, exceeding the state's total investment in the Liaoning region during the First Five-Year Plan by 66%. This money can be used to build 295 textile mills with 100,000 spindles each. By the end of 1956, the proportion of the output value of modern industry in Liaoning Province in the total industrial and agricultural output value of the province had increased from 62% in 1952 to 73.6%. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the cumulative total output value of state-owned and local state-owned industries in the province for the five years will exceed the target by 13%; the volume of capital construction work will exceed the target by 12.6%.
    In order to make full use of China's old heavy industrial base, the state carried out large-scale industrial capital construction here during the First Five-Year Plan. Of the 694 industrial construction projects above the quota in the country, 92 are in the Liaoning region, of which 24 belong to the 156 key projects. So far, among these 24 key projects, 13 new and renovated units, including the Fuxin Haizhou Open-pit Mine, Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, Shenyang Cable Factory, Fushun Aluminum Factory, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, Ping'an Vertical Shaft, Fuxin Power Plant, Dalian Thermal Power Plant, and Benxi Gongyuan Iron Factory, have been fully or basically put into production. Seven new or renovated units, including Anshan Iron and Steel, Fushun Two Open-pit Mines, Fushun Laohutai Inclined Shaft, Fushun Victory Inclined Shaft, Fushun Longfeng Inclined Shaft, and Fushun Petroleum No. 2 Factory, have been largely or partially put into production. By the end of this year, 35 of the 48 major sub-projects of the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex will be completed and put into production. After the above-mentioned key projects are put into production one after another, by the end of 1957, the steel production capacity can be increased by 1.67 million tons, the pig iron production capacity by 2.8 million tons, the steel production capacity by 1.1 million tons, the coal production capacity by 6.7 million tons, and the machine tool production capacity by 3,800 units.
    Due to the commissioning of a large number of new factories and a series of technological transformations in old factories, the production technology level of industries such as steel and machinery has been greatly improved. In 1956, the daily output per cubic meter of blast furnace volume increased to 1.35 tons of iron; the daily output per square meter of hearth area of open-hearth furnaces increased to 6.58 tons of steel. Both of these exceeded the most advanced level in the United States in 1955. Before liberation, only general steel types and a small amount of special steel could be produced here. Now the number of special steel types in the province has increased to more than 250. Over the past few years, new and old machinery factories in the province have produced more than 1,400 new products. 80% of the smelting equipment required for the construction of the three iron and steel bases in Anshan, Baotou, and Wuhan, such as mixer furnaces and sintering furnaces, are manufactured and supplied by machinery factories in Shenyang and Dalian. The successfully trial-produced 40,500 kVA, 220,000-volt high-voltage large transformer, the fast-pulling, fast-running 1-5-1 new steam locomotive, the 140-ton bridge crane, and the ocean-going freighter with a displacement of more than 22,000 tons that is being manufactured and can sail directly to San Francisco in the United States are all important products that China has never manufactured before.
    In the Liaoning region, the annual output of steel and pig iron in 1957 will be more than doubled compared with 1953. In the machinery industry, the annual output of machine tools will increase from 4,101 in 1952 to 7,600 in 1957. The production of coal and synthetic petroleum has also greatly developed. In 1957, the coal output here will increase by more than 10 million tons compared with 1952. The synthetic petroleum manufactured using coal and oil shale in Liaoning Province has also increased from 230,000 tons in 1952 to 820,000 tons in 1957, an increase of 2.5 times in five years.
    The old industry in the Liaoning region was established by Japanese imperialism during the 14 years of invading Northeast China in order to frantically plunder our country's resources. Before liberation, except for the Dalian area, almost all of them had stopped production. The total output value in 1948 was only 50% of that in 1943. From the time of liberation to the end of the economic recovery period, the industrial production in the Liaoning region exceeded the highest level in history. The total industrial output value of the province in 1957 is more than three times the highest production level of 1943 before liberation. From 1937 to 1943 was the golden age of economic leap forward in Liaoning Province before liberation, but the average annual growth rate was only 8.9%. In the four years from 1953 to 1956, the average growth rate was as high as 22%; if the recovery period is added, the average speed is as high as 30.3%. These facts show that the speed of development and brilliant achievements of socialist economic construction carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party are far beyond the comparison of capitalism.

    辽宁国营和地方国营工业
    提前完成五年总产值计划
    1957年工业总产值相当于解放前最高水平三倍多
    本报沈阳10日电　记者金雨困报道：生产全国三分之二的钢铁、三分之一的机械工业产品和大部分人造石油的辽宁地区，7月上旬提前完成了第一个五年计划工业的累积总产值；五年计划要求的工业生产水平，在去年10月底就提前达到了。按照前四年实绩和今年的计划，全省国营和地方国营企业五年中共为国家积累资金一百零三亿元，超过第一个五年计划期间国家在辽宁地区全部投资66％。这些钱，可以用来建设二百九十五个十万纱锭的纺织厂。到1956年年底，辽宁省现代工业的产值在全省工农业总产值中的比重，已经由1952年的62％上升到73.6％。预计到今年年底，全省国营和地方国营工业五年的累积总产值可超额13％；基本建设工作量可超额12.6％。
    国家为了充分利用我国旧有的重工业基地，第一个五年计划期间在这里进行了规模巨大的工业基本建设。全国六百九十四项限额以上的工业建设，在辽宁地区就有九十二项，其中属于一百五十六项重点工程的又有二十四项。到目前为止，在这二十四项重点工程中，已经有阜新海州露天矿、沈阳第一机床厂、沈阳电缆厂、抚顺铝厂、沈阳风动工具厂、平安竖井、阜新发电厂、大连热电站、本溪工源铁厂等十三个新建、改建单位全部或基本投入生产，已有鞍钢、抚顺两露天矿、抚顺老虎台斜井、抚顺胜利斜井、抚顺龙凤斜井、抚顺石油二厂等七个新建或改建单位大部或部分投入生产。鞍山钢铁联合企业的四十八个主要分项工程，到今年年底共可有三十五项完工投入生产。上述重点工程陆续投入生产以后，到1957年底即可增加钢的生产能力一百六十七万吨，生铁生产能力二百八十万吨，钢材生产能力一百一十万吨，煤炭生产能力六百七十万吨，机床生产能力三千八百台。
    由于大批新工厂投入生产和老工厂进行了一系列的技术改造，钢铁和机械等工业的生产技术水平都有很大提高。1956年，高炉每立方公尺容积每昼夜产量，已经提高到一点三五吨铁；平炉每平方公尺炉底面积每昼夜产量，提高到六点五八吨钢。这两项都超过了美国1955年最先进的水平。解放以前，这里仅能生产一般的钢种和少量特殊钢，现在全省特殊钢的品种已经增加到二百五十种以上。全省新老机械工厂，几年来制成的新产品有一千四百多种。鞍山、包头、武汉三个钢铁基地建设所需的混铁炉、烧结炉等冶炼设备，80％都由沈阳和旅大的机械工厂制造供应。已经试制成功的四万零五百千伏安、二十二万伏特的高压大型变压器，拉得多、跑得快的1—5—1新型蒸汽机车，起重一百四十吨的桥式起重机，以及正在制造的可以一直航行到美国旧金山的排水量二万二千多吨的远洋大货轮等，都是我国从来没有制造过的重要产品。
    辽宁地区1957年钢和生铁的年产量，都比1953年提高两倍以上；机械工业中，机床的年产量，由1952年的四千一百零一台提高到1957年的七千六百台。煤炭和人造石油的生产也有极大发展。1957年这里煤的产量将比1952年增加一千多万吨。利用辽宁省的煤和油母页岩制造的人造石油，也由1952年的年产二十三万吨增加到1957年的八十二万吨，五年中提高二点五倍。
    辽宁地区旧有的工业是日本帝国主义侵入东北十四年中，为疯狂掠夺我国资源而建立起来的。解放前夕除旅大地区外，几乎大部都已停止生产。1948年的生产总值仅及1943年的50％。解放后到经济恢复期末，辽宁地区的工业生产便超过了历史上的最高水平。1957年全省工业总产值相当于解放前生产水平最高的1943年的三倍多。1937年到1943年是辽宁省解放以前经济飞跃发展的黄金时代，但每年生产平均的增长速度仅达8.9％；在1953年到1956年的四年中，平均增长速度却高达22％；如果加上恢复时期，平均速度要高达30.3％。这些事实说明，在共产党领导下进行的社会主义经济建设，它的发展速度和光辉成就，是远非资本主义所能比拟的。
