    I completely agree with the reports given by Premier Zhou and other responsible comrades at this conference.
    Many representatives have said it well here: the bourgeois Rightists' attack on the Chinese Communist Party, on the people of the whole country, and on socialism this time has a complete program and well-thought-out strategies and tactics. Their goal is very clear, which is to eliminate socialism and restore capitalism, and in essence, to restore the semi-colonial and semi-feudal reactionary rule. This sinister purpose is also reflected in their "foreign policy." We can well imagine that if the Rightists' conspiracy succeeds and there really is a "rotation of power," and Luo Longji really becomes the foreign minister he dreams of, then the Rightists will implement their "foreign policy," which is essentially formulated for them by the US State Department.
    Rightist Ring Leaders' "Foreign Policy" is to Oppose the Soviet Union and Rely on the United States
    What is the essence of the "foreign policy" of the Zhang-Luo alliance and Rightist ring leaders such as Long Yun? It is: to oppose the Soviet Union and rely on the United States.
    Although the preamble to our country's constitution emphatically points out "opposition to imperialism," and points out that "our country has established an unbreakable friendship with the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and with the people's democratic countries... This friendship will continue to develop and consolidate," and although when our National People's Congress passed this constitution so solemnly three years ago, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Long Yun, and others also raised their hands to express their approval, and at the same time, Article 18 of the constitution stipulates that "all state organ workers must... abide by the constitution and the law," but the Rightist ring leaders can ignore all of these. What they are devoted to and insist on implementing in foreign relations is the "anti-Soviet, pro-American" policy.
    Luo Longji Consistently Opposes the Soviet Union and is Pro-American
    Luo Longji, one of the ring leaders of the former National Socialist Party (i.e., the Minsha Party), is fully capable of competing with Zhang Junmai, another ring leader of the National Socialist Party, on the issue of anti-Sovietism and anti-communism. As early as twenty-seven years ago, Luo Longji wrote: "Russia is now taking the opportunity to rise... The Communists are reaping the benefits, and once all of East Asia is communized, there will be no intact eggs under the overturned nest," he suggested that the reactionary factions of China and Japan unite to oppose the Soviet Union and "suppress the Communists." Since liberation, he has consistently opposed the policy of leaning to one side, hating the Soviet Union and advocating a pro-American line. He never forgets that US imperialism can one day buy Luo Longji, buy this group of "democratic individualists," so that it is more beneficial to US imperialism than Chiang Kai-shek. Luo Longji often said, "I want both socialism and the American way of life." We say that what you want is not true socialism, but Hitler-style, Zhang Junmai-style "national socialism." You are just using "socialism" as a cover to promote your "American way of life," to entice our people to take a pro-American line and become slaves of US imperialism.
    Zhang Bojun's Anti-Soviet Remarks in Moscow Must be Explained to the People
    Zhang Bojun, who started his career by opposing the Communist Party, is not weak on the anti-Soviet front. Apart from other things, just take his slander against the Soviet Union since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In fact, he actively participated in the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist cheerleading organized by the international bourgeois reactionaries on a global scale last year. As a people's representative, we all have the right to question Zhang Bojun: Last year, when you participated in the delegation of our National People's Congress (note that this is a delegation of our National People's Congress!) on a visit abroad, what kind of anti-Soviet remarks did you make at a banquet in the Kremlin in Moscow? Why did you make such anti-Soviet remarks? You must make a thorough explanation to all the representatives and the people of the whole country.
    Long Yun, Wang Jingwei's "Brother," Wantonly Provokes Sino-Soviet Relations
    Long Yun, this "brother," accomplice, protector, and liaison of the great traitor Wang Jingwei, has recently shown his skills in anti-Soviet activities. At the meeting of the Standing Committee of our National People's Congress on June 13 this year, he wantonly provoked Sino-Soviet relations, proposing that the Soviet Union's loans to our country were unreasonable and gave us pressure; accusing "when the Soviet army liberated the Northeast, they moved away a lot of industrial equipment," and so on. At the same time, Long Yun vigorously promoted in the Standing Committee of our National People's Congress how generous and kind the United States is. People cannot help but ask: Mr. Long Yun, after attending so many sessions of the National People's Congress, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the CPPCC, the Supreme State Council, and various meetings and forums, don't you even know that the Soviet Union's loans to us are to help our construction, with very low interest rates, even without interest? When the Soviet army helped us liberate the Northeast, the United States was helping Chiang Kai-shek airlift troops to the Northeast in a big way, wanting to make the Northeast a US military base. If those industrial equipment were not moved away, wouldn't it directly help the US and Chiang and greatly hinder the liberation of the whole country? Moreover, don't you know that since liberation, the industrial equipment supplied by the Soviet government to us, whether in quantity or technology, exceeds those old equipment many times over? Rightist gentlemen, you all know these things. Knowing it, keeping it in your stomach, not talking about it, and distorting and reversing it, that is your skill.
    Compare the Soviet Union and the United States
    Rightist gentlemen often ask us to compare the Soviet Union and the United States. Indeed, we need to compare, it is not good not to make such a comparison. People are not afraid of not knowing the goods, but are afraid of comparing goods. The Chinese people have come to a conclusion from the experience of actual life, from all aspects, comparing and comparing for decades: the Soviet Union is good to us, and the United States is very bad to us. Let's compare it. To name a few of the most obvious:
    The Soviet Union is a true socialist country, in which there is no oppression, no exploitation, no poverty, the people enjoy the greatest freedom, and the economy and culture can develop smoothly in a planned way. It treats the people of all countries and all nationalities equally, and it supports weak nations and the oppressed. This is very good. This conforms to the long-standing ideals and aspirations of the broad masses of our people. Therefore, we choose to take this path - "take the Russian path" (Sun Yat-sen), take the socialist path.
    The United States is a typical capitalist country, a typical imperialist country. In this country, the rich are extremely rich, and the poor are extremely poor; a small handful of financial oligarchs enjoy the greatest and all freedoms, but the broad masses of working people only have the "freedom" of hunger, poverty, unemployment, and persecution. It bullies and oppresses other countries and exercises colonial rule over backward and weak countries. This system and way of life in the United States only suit the tastes of a very small number of big bourgeoisie and their intellectuals in China, and are hated by the broad masses of our people, and have been increasingly hated by the people of the world recently. For such an imperialist country, the will of all our people is: we must never be close to it, we must never learn from it. This question has been resolved by the historical development of our country for decades.
    Who helped our revolution? Who helped our construction? Was it the socialist Soviet Union? Or the imperialist United States? Let's take a brief look back.
    The United States has Always Hated the People of our Country and has Tried its Best to Undermine our Peaceful Construction
    The US government has never given any help to our country's democratic revolution, even in the old democratic revolution led by the bourgeoisie before 1919, except for suppression (such as against the Boxers); when it came to the new democratic revolution led by the working class, it held even more bestial hatred, and it was even more impossible to talk about any help. During our country's War of Resistance Against Japan, only because Japan launched an attack on the United States did the United States regard China as an allied army, attempting to use our strength to attack the Japanese aggressors, but even then, the US government desperately supported the Chiang Kai-shek group, melting the communists and destroying the communists, and attacking the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan ended, the US government used all its power to direct and support the Chiang Kai-shek group to launch an anti-communist and anti-people national civil war. During that period, the US aid to Chiang Kai-shek did reach the shocking figure of 4.6 billion US dollars. This is probably the American generosity and kindness that Long Yun, Luo Longji, and others admire so much! The People's Republic of China was established, and our country was about to start a socialist revolution and socialist construction. What was the attitude of the United States? Resolutely not to recognize it! Comprehensive embargo! Attacking Korea and Vietnam in order to further attack our country and strangle the young People's Republic of China in the cradle. Long-term occupation of our sacred territory Taiwan, using the US-Japan-Chiang treaty and the Manila Treaty to encircle and threaten us! Resolutely not allowing the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations! Sending special agents and spies to our country to sabotage and disrupt. Mobilizing its own troops and arming the troops of the Chiang Kai-shek group to harass our country and undermine our peaceful construction. Until recently, Mr. Dulles loudly praised the remarks of the domestic right-wing elements in our country, echoing each other, praying for "the disappearance of communist China!" All this is the US government's "help" to our country's revolution and construction!
    The Soviet Union's Sincere and Selfless Help to the People of our Country is as Big as the Sky
    What about the Soviet Union? It is exactly like everyone knows, completely different from US imperialism. The Soviet Union has always supported our country's revolution. Lenin first gave Sun Yat-sen a high evaluation. As soon as the October Revolution succeeded, the Soviet Russian government first announced the abolition of all unequal treaties that Tsarist Russia had imposed on our country. The Soviet Union supported Sun Yat-sen in reorganizing the Kuomintang and strongly supported our country's first domestic revolutionary war. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union supported our country's resistance against Japan in all aspects, until it sent advisers and pilots to fight alongside the Chinese military and civilians, especially the Soviet army's dispatch of troops to the Northeast to finally defeat the Kwantung Army, which greatly accelerated the victory of our country's War of Resistance Against Japan. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union was the first to recognize our country. On February 14, 1950, it signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with our country. Since then, the Soviet Union began long-term, comprehensive and selfless assistance to our country. The Soviet government gave our country low-interest and interest-free loans to help our country restore and develop its economy; supported us in resisting US aggression and aiding Korea; sent a large number of experts and helped us build through technical cooperation. Developed Sino-Soviet trade, making the US embargo policy against our country bankrupt. Since our country began the construction of the first five-year plan in 1953, the Soviet Union has successively decided to help our country build and rebuild 156 important enterprises that are decisive for our country's industrialization. They helped us design, supply first-class equipment, and help us install it. The Soviet Union helped our country build large-scale projects such as reservoirs and the Yangtze River Iron Bridge, and helped us make water conservancy plans for the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Last year, the Soviet Union sent excellent scientists to help Chinese scientists formulate a twelve-year scientific development plan, to help our country build atomic reactors and cyclotrons; our country sent thousands of students to the Soviet Union to help us train a large number of experts, and so on. The Soviet government and people's long-term sincere and selfless help to our country's revolution and construction is as big as the sky. Could it be that the right-wing elements are really blocking the sky with one hand?
    The Rightist Elements Want us to Compare. Okay! What is the result of our comparison? Chairman Mao said in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Look at it! Who designed and equipped so many important factories for us? Did the United States give it to us? Did the United Kingdom give it to us? They didn't give it to us. Only the Soviet Union is willing to do this, because it is a socialist country and our allied country." This is our conclusion.
    Rightist Ambitious Figures Misjudged the Situation
    Rightist elements attempt to use every opportunity to realize their anti-Soviet agitation and conspiracy. Since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956, those right-wing ambitious figures have made completely wrong assessments of the domestic situation in the Soviet Union and the entire international situation. They believed that the situation in the Soviet Union was about to change drastically, and the international situation was also about to change drastically. Especially since the Polish and Hungarian events occurred between October and November, they believed that the socialist camp was not strong, the international situation was not heading towards relaxation but was becoming more tense, and even a third world war was about to break out. Therefore, they tried their best to occupy a place in the world-scale anti-Soviet and anti-Communist movement instigated by international bourgeois reactionaries, using the banner of criticizing Stalin and opposing dogmatism to launch vicious attacks on the Soviet Union. In this regard, Zhang Bojun can be regarded as a typical figure.
    This is the "Kind Heart" of the Rightists
    We say that we learn from foreign experience, as long as they are good, we must learn, but we must first and foremost learn from the Soviet Union. When learning, we must oppose the attitude of dogmatism, which is completely necessary. However, the right-wing elements, on the one hand, completely wiped out our achievements in learning from the Soviet Union, and at the same time, further used the signboard of opposing dogmatism to deny the great value of the Soviet Union's advanced experience, and politically tried to create an illusion in the minds of the people that we have made great losses in our work because we learned from the Soviet Union wrongly, and it seems that this loss should be the responsibility of the Soviet Union's experience, should be the responsibility of the experts sent to China by the Soviet Union, should be the responsibility of the Soviet Union. Therefore, for the Rightists, opposing dogmatism is opposing the Soviet Union. Isn't the rectification movement going to oppose subjectivism and oppose dogmatism? That's great, the opportunity is rare, take this opportunity to oppose the Soviet Union, kill several birds with one stone, wouldn't it be wonderful! This is the "kind heart" of the right-wing elements to help the Party's rectification!
    The Extremely Reactionary Essence of Rightist Thought
    The right-wing elements always want to seize some handles for the purpose of slandering and vilifying the Soviet Union with regard to various measures in the Soviet Union. For example, the Soviet Union's party and government decided to carry out large-scale land reclamation, which is undoubtedly a great thing, but the right-wing elements want to say that the Soviet Union's food problem is serious and there is a famine. The Soviet Union's party and government recently decided to adjust the management institutions of the national economy and expand the authority of the allied republics and localities. This is obviously an extremely important and timely measure to promote the Soviet Union's communist construction. But the right-wing elements want to say that the leading prestige of the Soviet Union's Party Central Committee has been reduced. In short, these bourgeois right-wing elements, starting from their class instinct of hatred, look at all the problems of the Soviet Union and all aspects of Sino-Soviet relations. What the people say is good, they always say is bad, and vice versa, what the people say is bad, they insist on saying is good. Different positions produce such fundamental differences. These bourgeois right-wing elements use extremely narrow aggressive nationalist ideas to oppose the proletarian internationalist ideas on the Soviet Union issue. And on the issue of US imperialism, they also deal with it according to their inherent national capitulationism. This further exposes the extremely reactionary essence of bourgeois right-wing thought.
    Long Live the Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance!
    All members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the people of the whole country express their infinite anger at the bourgeois right-wing's rampant anti-Soviet conspiracy. We and the people of the whole country resolutely counterattack the bourgeois right-wing's anti-Communist, anti-people, anti-socialist, and anti-Soviet attack this time. We will never withdraw until we completely smash the right-wing conspiracy. We must continue to firmly develop and consolidate the unity and cooperation with the great Soviet Union, and at the same time develop and consolidate the unity and cooperation of all socialist countries. This is our basic policy and our basic interest. Our rock-solid unity is based on internationalism and national equality, and cannot be undermined by any instigation. It is the decisive guarantee for world peace and the cause of human progress. All anti-Soviet conspiracies of the right-wing elements are bound to fail. Socialism is bound to win. Long live the great Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance!

### 彻底粉碎右派的进攻，继续发展和巩固中苏伟大友谊！  钱俊瑞的发言

    彻底粉碎右派的进攻，继续发展和巩固中苏伟大友谊！
    钱俊瑞的发言
    我完全同意周总理和其他几位负责同志在这次大会上的报告。
    许多代表在这里说得很好：资产阶级右派这次向中国共产党、向全国人民、向社会主义的进攻，是有全套纲领的，是有经过深思熟虑的战略战术的。他们的目标十分明确，就是消灭社会主义，恢复资本主义，实质上也就是使半殖民地半封建的反动统治复辟。这个罪恶的目的同样反映在他们的“对外政策”上。我们完全可以设想，如果右派的阴谋得逞，真个来一个
  “轮流执政”，罗隆基真个当上了他寤寐求之的外交部长，那末右派就会实行他们的实质上是美国国务院为他们制定的“对外政策”。
    右派头目的“对外政策”是反对苏联，投靠美国
    什么是章罗同盟和龙云等右派头目的“对外政策”的实质呢？那就是：反对苏联，投靠美国。
    尽管我们国家的宪法在序言中强调地指出“反对帝国主义”，指出“我国同伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、同各人民民主国家已经建立了牢不可破的友谊……这种友谊将继续发展和巩固”，而且尽管在三年前我们全国人民代表大会第一次会议如此庄严隆重地通过这个宪法的时候，章伯钧、罗隆基、龙云等也都举手表示赞成，同时宪法第十八条又规定了“一切国家机关工作人员必须……服从宪法和法律”，但是所有这些，右派头子们都可以置之不理。他们在对外关系上所拳拳服膺而且坚持贯彻的就是“反苏，亲美”四个大字。
    罗隆基一贯反苏亲美
    前国社党（即民社党）头子之一罗隆基在反苏反共问题上是完全能够和国社党的另一头目张君劢媲美的。早在二十七年前，罗隆基就写道：“俄国如今已乘机而起，……共产渔人之利，一旦东亚全部赤化，复巢之下宁有完卵”，他献计中日两国反动派联合反苏“剿共”。解放以来，他一贯反对一面倒的国策，仇视苏联，提倡亲美路线。他念念不忘美帝国主义能够有朝一日来买罗隆基这匹马，买“民主个人主义者”这一窝子的马，以便比蒋介石更有利于美帝国主义。罗隆基常说，“我既要社会主义，又要美国生活方式。”我们说，你要的并不是真正的社会主义，而是希特勒式、张君劢式的“国家社会主义”，你不过是用“社会主义”作幌子，宣扬你的“美国生活方式”，利诱我国人民走亲美路线，当美帝国主义的奴才而已。
    章伯钧在莫斯科的反苏谈话，必须向人民交代
    反共起家的章伯钧在反苏阵线上并不示弱。别的且不说吧，单说从苏联共产党二十次代表大会以后他对苏联的污蔑中伤，实际上异常积极地参加了去年国际资产阶级反动派在世界范围内组织的反苏反共的啦啦队。作为人民代表，我们都有权质问章伯钧：在去年你参加我国人大代表团（注意，这是我们全国人民代表大会的代表团！）出国访问，你在莫斯科克里姆林宫的一次宴会上，曾经发表了一篇什么样子的反苏谈话？你为什么要发表这样一篇反苏谈话？你必须向全体代表和全国人民作彻底的交代。
    龙云这位汪精卫的“仁兄”放肆地挑拨中苏关系
    龙云，这位大卖国贼汪精卫的“仁兄”、同谋者、庇护人和联络员，最近在反苏活动上特别显出他的身手。他在今年六月十三日的我们人大的常务委员会会议上，竟然放肆地挑拨中苏关系，提出什么苏联对我国的借款不合理，并且给我们以压力呀；指责“苏军解放东北时，搬走了许多工业装备”呀，等等。同时龙云又在我们人大的常委会上大肆宣传美国如何如何大方和善良。人们不禁要问：龙云先生，你参加多少次的人大会议、人大常务会议、政协会议、最高国务会议，以及各种各样的会议和座谈会，你难道连苏联对我们的贷款是帮助我国的建设，利率很低，甚至没有利息，这一点还不知道么？苏军帮助我们解放东北时，美国正帮助蒋介石大举空运军队到东北，要使东北成为美国的军事基地，那些工业装备如果不搬走，不是直接地帮助了美蒋，大大地阻碍全国的解放么？而且，你难道不知道，解放以来，苏联政府供给我们的工业装备，不论在数量上和技术上，不知要超过那些旧有的装备多少倍么？右派先生们，这些你们是统统知道的。知道了，放在肚子里，不讲，而且加以歪曲和颠倒，这就算是你们的本领。
    把苏联和美国比一比
    右派先生们常常要我们把苏联和美国比一比。的确需要比，不作这样的比较是不好的，不怕不识货，只怕货比货。中国人民从实际生活的体验中，从各方面比，比来比去，比了几十年，才得出一条结论就是：苏联对我们好，美国对我们很不好。试比一下吧。举其荦荦大者：
    苏联是一个真正的社会主义国家，在这个国家里没有压迫、没有剥削、没有穷困，人民享有最大的自由，经济文化可以有计划地顺畅地发展。它以平等对待各国人民、各个民族，他扶助弱小民族和被压迫者。这个好得很。这合乎我国广大人民历来的理想和愿望。因此，我们就选择走这条路——“走俄国人的路”（孙中山），走社会主义的路。
    美国是一个典型的资本主义国家，典型的帝国主义国家。在这个国家里，富的富煞，穷的穷煞；一小撮金融寡头享有最大的和一切的自由，广大劳动人民却只有饥饿、贫困、失业和受迫害的“自由”。它欺负和压迫别的国家，对落后的弱小的国家实行殖民主义的统治。美国的这种制度，这种生活方式，只合乎中国极少数大资产阶级和他们的知识分子的脾胃，而遭到我国广大人民的痛恨，而且近来越来越厉害地遭到了全世界人民的痛恨。对于这样的帝国主义国家，我们全体人民的意志是：决不可亲，决不可学。这个问题已经为几十年来我国的历史发展所解决了。
    谁帮助了我们的革命？谁帮助了我们的建设？是社会主义的苏联？还是帝国主义的美国？让我们简单地回顾一下吧。
    美国一贯仇视我国人民  极力破坏我国和平建设
    美国政府对于我国的民主革命，即使在一九一九年以前资产阶级领导的旧民主革命时期，除了镇压（如对义和团），从来没有给以任何帮助；到工人阶级领导的新民主革命时期，它就更加抱持兽性的仇视，更加说不到什么帮助了。我国抗日战争时期，只因为日本向美国发动了进攻，美国才以中国为同盟军，企图用我们的力量来打击日本侵略者，但是即使在那时，美国政府也拼命地支持蒋介石集团、溶共灭共，打击八路军、新四军的政策。抗日战争一结束，美国政府就用了全力指使和支援蒋介石集团，发动反共反人民的全国大内战。就在那个时期，美国给予蒋介石的贷款援助确乎达到四十六亿美元的惊人数字。这大概就是龙云、罗隆基之流所钦羡莫名的美国式的大方和善良罢！中华人民共和国成立了，我国要开始进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设了，美国的态度怎样呢？坚决不承认！全面禁运！进攻朝鲜、越南，以便进一步进攻我国，把年轻的中华人民共和国扼杀在摇篮里。长期侵占我们的神圣领土台湾，用美日蒋条约和马尼拉条约来包围威胁我们！坚决不让中华人民共和国进入联合国！派遣特务间谍来我国破坏捣乱。动员自己的军队，武装蒋介石集团的军队来我国境内骚扰，破坏我们的和平建设。一直到最近杜勒斯先生对我国国内右派分子的言论大声叫好，相互呼应，祈祷着“共产主义中国的消逝！”这一切，就是美国政府对我国革命和建设的“帮助”！
    苏联对我国人民真诚无私给我们的帮助像天一般大
    苏联怎么样呢？那正像大家所熟知的，他和美帝国主义完全两样。苏联对我国的革命从来就支持。列宁对于孙中山首先给以崇高的评价。十月革命一成功，苏俄政府首先宣布取消帝俄对我国的一切不平等条约。苏联支持孙中山改组国民党，大力支持我国的第一次国内革命战争。在抗日战争时期，苏联在各方面支援我国的抗战，一直到派遣顾问和飞行员，同我国军民共同浴血作战，特别是苏军出兵东北最后击败关东军，大大加速了我国抗日战争的胜利。中华人民共和国成立后，苏联第一个承认我国。一九五○年二月十四日就和我国签订中苏友好同盟互助条约，从此苏联就开始了对我国长期的、全面的、无私的援助。苏联政府给我国以低利和无利贷款，帮助我国恢复和发展经济；支援我们抗美援朝；派遣大批专家和通过技术合作来帮助我们建设。发展中苏贸易，使美国对我国的禁运政策破产。从一九五三年我国开始了第一个五年计划的建设后，苏联曾先后决定帮助我国新建和改建对我国工业化有决定意义的一百五十六项重要企业，他们帮助我们设计，供应头等的装备，帮助我们安装。苏联帮助我国建设大规模的水库和长江大铁桥一类的大工程，帮助我们作黄河和长江的水利规划。去年苏联派遣优秀的科学家，帮同我国科学家作出十二年科学发展的规划，为我国建立原子反应堆和回旋加速器；我国派遣几千留学生到苏联，帮助我们培养大批专家，等等。苏联政府和人民长时期来对我国的革命和建设这样真诚无私的帮助，真像天一般大，难道右派分子果真是一手遮天么？
    右派分子要我们比一比。好吧！我们比较一下的结果怎么样呢？毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话中说：“大家看吧！谁给我们设计和装备了这么多的重要工厂呢？美国给我们没有？英国给我们没有？他们都不给。只有苏联肯这样做，因为它是社会主义国家，是我们的同盟国家。”这就是我们的结论。
    右派野心家错估了形势
    右派分子企图利用一切机会实现他们反苏的煽动和阴谋。从一九五六年苏共第二十次党代表大会以后，那些右派野心家对苏联国内形势和整个国际形势作了完全错误的估计。他们认为苏联的局面要大变了，国际局势也要大变了。特别从十月十一月间波兰和匈牙利事件发生以后，他们认为社会主义阵营不牢靠了，国际局势不是走向和缓而是更趋紧张了，甚至第三次世界大战快爆发了。于是他们竭力想要在国际资产阶级反动派所煽动的世界规模的反苏反共运动中占一席地，借批判斯大林和反对教条主义的旗子来对苏联进行恶毒的攻击。在这一方面，章伯钧可算是一个典型人物。
    这就是右派的“好心肠”
    我们说，我们学习外国的经验，只要它们是好的，我们都要学，但是我们首先和主要的还是要学苏联。在学习的时候，我们要反对教条主义的态度，这是完全必须的。但是右派分子一方面把我们学习苏联的成绩一笔加以抹煞，同时进一步用反对教条主义的招牌，来否定苏联先进经验的重大价值，在政治上企图在人民心目中造成一种错觉，似乎我们因为学苏联学错了，在工作中已经造成了很大的损失，似乎这种损失就应该由苏联经验负责，应该由苏联派来中国的专家负责，应该由苏联负责。因此，对于右派说来，反对教条主义就是反对苏联。整风运动不是要反对主观主义，反对教条主义吗？那好极了，机会难得，借此反苏，一举数得，岂不妙哉！这就是右派分子的帮助党整风的一股“好心肠”！
    右派思想极端反动的本质
    右派分子对于苏联国内的各种措施，总想抓些把柄来达到他们中伤和污蔑苏联的目的。比如，苏联的党和政府决定大规模垦荒，那无疑是件大好事，但右派分子却要说苏联粮食问题严重，闹荒了。苏联党和政府最近决定调整国民经济的管理机构，扩大加盟共和国和地方的权限。这对推进苏联的共产主义建设显然是极其重要和适时的措施。但右派分子却要说，苏联党中央的领导威信降低了。总之，这些资产阶级右派分子从他们的阶级本能的仇视出发，看待苏联的一切问题，看待中苏关系的一切方面，人民说是好的，他们总说是坏的，反之，人民说是坏的，他们偏说是好的。立场不同，就产生了这样根本的分歧。这些资产阶级右派分子在对苏联的问题上用极端狭隘的侵略性的民族主义思想，来反对无产阶级的国际主义思想。而在对美帝国主义的问题上，他们却根据也是他们所固有的民族投降主义来打交道了。这就更加暴露出资产阶级右派思想极端反动的本质。
    中苏友好同盟万岁！
    中苏友好协会全体会员和全国人民对于资产阶级右派猖狂的反苏阴谋表示无比的愤怒。我们和全国人民一起坚决回击资产阶级右派这一次反共、反人民、反社会主义、反苏的进攻。不彻底粉碎右派的阴谋，我们决不收兵。我们一定要继续坚定不移地发展和巩固同伟大苏联的团结合作，同时发展和巩固一切社会主义国家的团结和合作。这是我们的基本方针，也是我们的基本利益所在。我们的这种坚如磐石的团结，是建立在国际主义和民族平等的基础上的，是任何挑拨离间所不能破坏的。它是世界和平和人类进步事业的决定性的保证。右派分子的一切反苏阴谋一定归于失败。社会主义一定胜利。伟大的中苏友好同盟万岁！
