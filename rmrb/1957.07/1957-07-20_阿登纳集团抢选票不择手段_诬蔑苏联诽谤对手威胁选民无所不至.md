Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 19th: As the date of the general election scheduled for September approaches, Adenauer and his Christian Democratic Union are stepping up their efforts to use deception and threats to win votes.

Eighty-one-year-old Adenauer, in weather of about one hundred degrees Fahrenheit, desperately travels to various places to deliver campaign speeches. On the one hand, he reiterates the slander that the Soviet Union has "aggressive intentions" to defend his unpopular "policy of strength," and on the other hand, he guarantees everywhere that he will improve the lives of workers and farmers.

What gives Adenauer the biggest headache is that he has an electoral opponent who opposes militaristic policies—the Social Democratic Party. Therefore, he slanders this party in every possible way.

Echoing Adenauer's approach, the Christian Democratic Union also hurriedly announced an agricultural program at an agricultural conference held in Cologne, making promises to farmers regarding the modernization of production technology in small and medium-sized farms and the use of tariffs to protect domestic agricultural products. At the same time, it also tries to restrict the electoral freedom of believers through the church. Bishops openly tell their believers: they are not allowed to elect Social Democratic parliamentary candidates, but must elect Christian Democratic Union candidates to show "loyalty" to the church.

    阿登纳集团抢选票不择手段
    诬蔑苏联诽谤对手威胁选民无所不至
    据新华社19日讯  波恩消息：随着定在9月举行的大选日期的临近，阿登纳和他的基督教民主联盟正在加紧施展欺骗和威胁的手段来进行争取选票的活动。
    八十一岁的阿登纳在华氏一百度左右的炎热的天气下，拼命到各地发表竞选演说。他一方面重弹苏联有“侵略意图”的谰调来为他的不得人心的“实力政策”辩护，另一方面还到处保证，他将改善工人和农民的生活。
    使阿登纳最感头痛的是他有着一个反对军国主义政策的竞选对手——社会民主党，他因而对这个党百般诽谤。
    与阿登纳的作法相呼应，基督教民主联盟也急急忙忙在科隆召开的农业会议上宣布了一项农业纲领，向农民作出了关于中小农场生产技术现代化和利用关税保护国内农产品的诺言。同时，它又设法通过教会来限制教徒们的选举自由。主教们公开告诉他们的教徒们：不准选举社会民主党的议员候选人，必须选举基督教民主联盟的候选人，以表示对教会的“忠诚”。
