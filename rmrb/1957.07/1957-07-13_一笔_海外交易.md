    An "Overseas Deal"
    On May 24, eleven Arab countries, including Egypt, Iraq, and Jordan, jointly suggested that the United States participate in an international investigation into France's atrocities against the Algerian people, and demanded that the United States stop its military aid to France, because this aid was being used by France to pursue a colonial policy in Algeria.
    After more than a month, the United States finally issued a reply note to the eleven Arab countries. It believed that the Arab countries' proposal was "not conducive to a peaceful solution to the problem"; and that the US military aid "is provided within the scope of cooperative arrangements for common defense" and "is in line with the US government's policy and the interests of the free world," and therefore cannot be stopped.
    There is no common language between colonialism and Arab nationalism. What exactly do the United States' so-called "peaceful solution" and "free world interests" mean? In the "Overseas Trade" column of the American "Time" magazine published on July 1, there was a newsletter titled "Gold from the Sand." This newsletter inadvertently provided an excellent footnote to Washington's diplomatic rhetoric.
    "Time" magazine reported with greedy eyes on the remarks of the first French Minister for the Sahara and the mineral deposits that have been identified in the Sahara Desert: one million tons of manganese ore with a content of 45%, 100 million tons of coal, 2.5 billion tons of iron ore with a content of 53%-65%, and 25 million tons of copper ore. In addition, rich deposits of gold, platinum, nickel, tin, chromium, uranium, and other minerals have been discovered in the Ahaggar Mountains in the central Sahara Desert. As for oil, "Time" magazine said: "The prospects are even brighter." In just three areas south of Algiers, there are reserves of 3.5 billion barrels, and the potential reserves are 7 billion barrels, the purity of which is "so high that it can be used to power internal combustion engines without refining."
    According to "Time" magazine, while the US State Department was delaying its response to the just demands of the eleven Arab countries, several American oil companies were conducting intensive negotiations with the French government in Paris. After September, New York Mobil Oil Company, Cities Service Company, and others will obtain oil exploration rights on 27 million acres of land. According to American oil merchants, France will sell 45% of the equity to American companies and Anglo-Dutch oil companies.
    Oil is just one of the abundant treasures in the Sahara Desert, but from the recent oil negotiations between the United States and France, we can see what the US standard for "peacefully resolving the problem" in its note to the eleven Arab countries is, and what the content of the so-called "free world interests" is. The high-sounding diplomatic rhetoric of the US note cannot hide the dirty "overseas deal" in the colonialist diplomatic black shop that uses the blood of the Algerian people to exchange for oil.

### 一笔“海外交易”

    一笔“海外交易”
    5月24日，埃及、伊拉克、约旦等十一个阿拉伯国家曾经联合建议美国参加对法国屠杀阿尔及利亚人民暴行的国际调查，并且要求美国停止对法国的军事援助，因为这种援助正被法国利用来在阿尔及利亚推行殖民政策。
    拖了一个多月，美国才对十一个阿拉伯国家提出答复照会。它认为阿拉伯国家的建议“不利于和平解决问题”；而美国的军事援助“是在共同防御的合作安排范围内提供的”，“是符合美国政府政策和自由世界利益的”，因此不能停止。
    殖民主义和阿拉伯民族主义之间是没有共同语言的。美国的所谓“和平解决”和“自由世界利益”到底是什么意思呢？在7月1日出版的美国“时代周刊”的“海外交易”一栏中，有一篇题为“沙中取金”的通讯。这篇通讯无意间替华盛顿的外交辞令作了极好的注脚。
    “时代周刊”垂涎三尺地报道了法国第一任撒哈拉部部长的谈话和已经在撒哈拉沙漠中探明的矿藏：含量45％的一百万吨锰矿，一亿吨煤矿，含量53％—65％的数达二十五亿吨的铁矿，二千五百万吨铜矿。另外，在撒哈拉沙漠中部的阿哈加尔山区，还发现了丰富的金、白金、镍、锡、铬、铀等矿藏。至于石油，“时代周刊”说：“前景更是光辉灿烂”。仅在阿尔及尔以南三个地区中，即有三十五亿桶的藏量，而可能藏量是七十亿桶，其纯度是“无需提炼，就可用来开动内燃机”。
    根据“时代周刊”的透露，就在美国国务院对十一个阿拉伯国家的正义要求迟迟不作答复的时候，美国的几家石油公司却在巴黎和法国政府进行紧锣密鼓的谈判。9月份以后，纽约美孚油公司、城市服务公司等即将获得二千七百万英亩土地上的石油开采权。据美国石油商人估计，法国将出售45％的权益给美国的公司和英荷石油公司。
    石油只不过是撒哈拉沙漠中丰富宝藏之一，但是从美、法最近举行的石油谈判就可以看出美国在给十一个阿拉伯国家照会中的所谓“和平解决问题”的标准究竟是什么，所谓“自由世界利益”的内容究竟是些什么。美国的照会的堂皇的外交辞令掩盖不了殖民主义外交黑店中这笔用阿尔及利亚人民的鲜血来换取石油的肮脏的“海外交易”。
