Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Yuan Xuefen, Chang Xiangyu, Chen Shufang, and Lang Xianfen, representatives of the National People's Congress, submitted opinions to the opera circle on the 21st, suggesting that they improve the quality of operas and not perform bad plays. The full text is as follows:

    Following the Second National Opera Repertoire Conference in 1956, the Ministry of Culture, based on the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," announced the decision to open up all traditional opera repertoires.

    From 1950 to 1952, the Central Opera Reform Committee successively decided to stop performing twenty-six opera repertoires. This played a positive role in clarifying the chaotic situation of the performing repertoire and was supported by the broad masses and opera workers. It was right to do so at the time.

    At present, the large-scale and tempestuous mass class struggle in the country has basically ended, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been consolidated. The direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers has been generally recognized by the literary and art circles, the face of the opera stage has also changed, and the political consciousness of the broad audience and artists has been improved. On this basis, especially under the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" put forward by the Party, it is no longer necessary to take administrative orders to prohibit bad plays that have been passed down from the past. In addition, there was a lack of specific analysis of the repertoires that were stopped at that time, and some deviations occurred in the implementation, creating many rigid rules and regulations. Some of the traditional repertoires, due to the mixing of essence and dross, were implicated by the banned plays. In the case of not distinguishing jade from stone, even those not within the twenty-six were abandoned. In order to implement the policy of boldly opening up the repertoire, removing inappropriate rigid rules and regulations in the repertoire work, and better carrying out the work of excavating traditional repertoires, in the future, we should use various repertoire competitions of varying quality, free discussions, and methods of ideological criticism, so that excellent repertoires continue to emerge and improve. For bad plays, let the broad masses and artists identify, discuss, criticize, and choose, so as to receive education and improve their ideological level. This will solve the problem more thoroughly.

    The measure of opening up the repertoire has been warmly welcomed by the artists, and a particularly active phenomenon of performing repertoires has appeared on the stage, which is a good phenomenon. However, on the other hand, according to recent incomplete statistics, in seventeen cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing, some troupes are using the repertoires that were once banned, performing them unchanged to attract audiences. It is said that individual places have even put plays that are worse than the twenty-six on the stage. We know that some of the banned plays also have artistic value, and of course they can be appropriately revised and reorganized to meet the audience. But there are also some that have nothing but horror, ugliness, or obscenity and vulgarity, such as "Killing Son for Revenge" and "Huang Shi's Daughter's Journey to the Underworld." Several troupes in Beijing and Tianjin are performing such bad plays at the same time, forming a phenomenon of competing to release poisonous weeds. Many audiences and artists who have improved their awareness have expressed dissatisfaction with these plays and have filed objections with the cultural authorities and troupes. If this trend continues, it will lead the beautiful opera art to a path of degeneration and regression.

    The purpose of opening up the repertoire is to better promote the excellent traditions in our opera art. Although the government does not use administrative orders to ban bad plays, we must recognize that this does not mean that there are no standards of good and bad in art. Originally, in our artistic undertakings, we must first have the cultivation to distinguish between fine and rough, beautiful and ugly, so that we will not go astray, and of course, we should do the same in the selection of repertoires. Therefore, we should have something to promote and something to oppose. What we advocate are excellent repertoires that are rich in ideology and artistry. As for things that are not of much value in content and performance, and are even ugly, obscene, terrifying, and harmful to people's physical and mental health, they are what we firmly oppose.

    It has been eight years since liberation. Through the education of the Party, we have made great progress in our thinking. We realize that we also bear great responsibilities in the socialist construction cause. Now that the Party and the government allow us to be masters in our own cause, we should make further efforts for the healthy development of opera art; do not lose the trust of the people that we have won since liberation.

    We put forward the following three points for the response of the opera circle:

    (1) We will continue to work hard under the leadership of the Party to improve the ideological and artistic quality of opera, use socialism and patriotism to temper ourselves, and influence the audience.

    (2) We agree to perform more excellent repertoires with educational significance and skills, and improve some plays that have no significance but have skills.

    (3) We agree not to perform bad plays that are ugly, obscene, terrifying, and harmful to people's physical and mental health.

### 梅兰芳、周信芳、程砚秋、袁雪芬、常香玉、陈书舫、郎咸芬  建议戏曲界不演坏戏

    建议戏曲界不演坏戏
    新华社讯　全国人民代表大会代表梅兰芳、周信芳、程砚秋、袁雪芬、常香玉、陈书舫和郎咸芬21日向戏曲界提出提高戏曲质量，不演坏戏的意见。全文如下：
    在1956年第二次全国戏曲剧目工作会议之后，文化部根据“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，宣布了对所有传统剧目一律开放的决定。
    从1950年到1952年间，先后经中央戏曲改进委员会决议停演了二十六出戏曲剧目。这对澄清上演剧目混乱状况，曾起了积极的作用，也受到广大群众与戏曲工作者的拥护，当时这样做是对的。
    到了目前，国内大规模的疾风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争基本上已经结束，人民民主专政已经巩固。文艺为工农兵服务的方向已为文艺界所公认，戏曲舞台的面貌也已改变，广大观众和艺人的政治觉悟都有所提高，在这样的基础上，特别是在党提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针下，对于过去流传下来的坏戏已没有采取以行政命令禁止的必要。加以当时对停演剧目缺乏具体分析，在执行中又发生过一些偏差，造成许多清规戒律，其中一部分传统剧目，由于菁华和糟粕揉和在一起，受到禁戏的株连，在玉石不分的情况下，甚至不在这二十六出之内的，也被摈弃了。为了贯彻大胆放手开放剧目的方针，去掉剧目工作中不适当的清规戒律，使挖掘传统剧目的工作更好地开展，今后应该通过各种良莠不齐的剧目竞赛，自由讨论和思想批判的方法，使优秀剧目不断出现与提高，对于坏戏让广大群众和艺人进行鉴别，讨论，批判和取舍，从而接受教育，提高思想水平，这样解决问题就会更彻底一些。
    开放剧目的措施受到了艺人的热烈欢迎，在舞台上呈现了上演剧目分外活跃的现象，这现象是好的。但是另一方面，据最近不完全的统计，在北京、天津、上海、武汉、重庆等十七个城市中，有一些剧团，以曾经禁演过的剧目，原封不动地演出来号召观众，据说个别的地方把比二十六出更坏的戏，也搬上了舞台。我们知道在禁戏中也有一部分是有艺术价值的，当然可以经过适当的修改整理来和观众见面，但也有一部分除了恐怖丑恶或淫猥低级之外，再没有什么内容了，如“杀子报”、“黄氏女游阴”之类，这样的坏戏在北京、天津各地就有好几个剧团同时演出，形成了竞放毒草的现象。很多觉悟已经提高的观众和艺人对这些戏表示不满，纷纷给文化主管部门和剧团提出反对意见。此风若长，就会将优美的戏曲艺术引向堕落倒退的道路。
    开放剧目的目的，是为了更好地发扬我们戏曲艺术中的优良传统，虽然政府不用行政命令来取缔坏戏，但我们必须认识到这不等于艺术上没有好坏的标准。本来我们在艺术事业中，首先就要有辨别精粗美恶的修养，才不会走错道路，在剧目的选择上当然也应如此。所以我们应该有所提倡，也有所反对。我们提倡的是富有思想性艺术性的优秀剧目，至于内容和表演无甚价值甚而丑恶、淫猥、恐怖，对人们身心健康有害的东西，则是我们所坚决反对的。
    解放八年了，我们经过党的教育，在思想上已有了很大的提高，我们认识到在社会主义建设事业中，我们也负着很大的责任，现在党和政府让我们在自己事业上当家作主，我们应该为戏曲艺术的健康发展，作更进一步的努力；不要把解放以来曾经争取到的人民的信任又丧失掉了。
    我们提出下述三点意见征求戏曲界的响应：
    （1）我们继续努力在党的领导下，提高戏曲的思想质量与艺术质量，以社会主义、爱国主义精神锻炼自己，影响观众。
    （2）我们相约多演富有教育意义和技术的优秀剧目，并把一些虽无甚意义但有技术的戏加以改进。
    （3）我们相约不演丑恶、淫猥、恐怖、有害人民身心健康的坏戏。
