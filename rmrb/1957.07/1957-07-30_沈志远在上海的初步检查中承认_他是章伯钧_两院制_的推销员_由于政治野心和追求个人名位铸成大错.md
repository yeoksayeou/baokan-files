    Shen Zhiyuan Admits in Preliminary Self-Criticism in Shanghai That He Was Zhang Bojun's "Bicameral System" Promoter, Making a Grave Mistake Due to Political Ambition and the Pursuit of Personal Fame
    (Xinhua News Agency Dispatch) Shen Zhiyuan, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and Director of the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Economic Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, admitted at a forum of Shanghai philosophy and social science circles on the 27th that he had committed a serious error of opposing the Communist Party and socialism, and was a complete rightist, and made a preliminary self-criticism.
    The philosophers and social scientists here have held three forums in succession in recent days, criticizing and questioning Shen Zhiyuan's series of erroneous words and deeds over the past year and his ambiguous attitude in the anti-rightist struggle. Shen Zhiyuan's self-criticism on the 27th concerned only a part of the errors he had committed. As for the part related to the China Democratic League, he said that he would examine himself within the League.
    Shen Zhiyuan admitted some of the facts revealed by everyone. He said that he had acted as Zhang Bojun's voluntary promoter of the "bicameral system," bringing Zhang Bojun's remarks on the "bicameral system" from Beijing to Shanghai to be conveyed within the League, and even asking the Standing Committee of the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League to discuss and study it, causing ideological confusion. Shen Zhiyuan admitted that he had committed a major crime of inciting the masses to attack the Party. His attack on dogmatism was not a genuine opposition to dogmatism, but an attack on the ideological leadership of Marxism-Leninism. His suggestion to change the Party committee system in universities was essentially an attempt to abolish the Party's leadership over universities. His demand to "open up" the publishing industry to society was to provide convenience for the peddlers of bourgeois ideology, and his advocacy of opening up a "free market" for hiring talents meant the destruction of the socialist personnel system of the state's planned and unified allocation of talent.
    In his speech, Shen Zhiyuan also admitted some of the mistakes he had committed in implementing the reactionary scientific program of the Zhang-Luo alliance.
    In his speech, Shen Zhiyuan made a preliminary self-criticism of the ideological roots of these errors, which were his thoughts of pursuing personal fame and political ambition. He said: In 1949, when the Central People's Government was established, he was appointed Director of the Translation Bureau of the General Administration of Publications, while many other democratic figures became vice ministers and university presidents. He felt dissatisfied and echoed the rumors of "better a late revolution than an early revolution, better no revolution than a late revolution." When he first arrived in Shanghai, he was announced as the Director of the Counselor's Office of the East China Military and Political Committee, but he refused the appointment on the pretext that the work of the Counselor's Office was difficult to handle, but in fact, he disliked the low position. In 1953, when he became Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the East China Administrative Committee, he again felt that he had no real power. In the past two or three years, although he was reluctant to give up scientific research, he was unwilling not to engage in social activities in order to increase his political capital. Whenever he had the opportunity, he would unscrupulously lower the prestige of the Party and raise the status and role of the China Democratic League in order to confront the Party and bargain with it to improve his political status. When Zhang Bojun proposed the "bicameral system," he thought that when it was implemented, he, Shen Zhiyuan, would certainly have a share, and a resonance occurred in his mind.
    Shen Zhiyuan admitted that on many political issues, he always supported the Party on the surface, but he was often swayed by "observing the wind direction, watching the climate, and a speculative mentality."
    Speaking of his relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance clique, Shen Zhiyuan said that they were mutually exploiting each other. Chen Renbing and other members of the Zhang-Luo alliance clique used him to manipulate and control the affairs of the League, and he used them to consolidate and improve his position. He admired Chen Renbing's experience of setting fires in the five forums held at the Shanghai Film Studio and wanted to introduce it at the working conference of the China Democratic League. Shen Zhiyuan said that for more than a year, he had often read and believed one-sided reflections and reports from the grassroots collected by Chen Renbing and Sun Siming, which further fueled the long-standing accumulated dissatisfaction with the Party in his heart. Coupled with the stimulation of the "great blooming and contending" atmosphere and the pressure from some backward masses at the grassroots level of the China Democratic League demanding that the Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League guarantee the "great blooming and contending," his major mistake finally erupted from the inner brewing into public action, falling into the rightist quagmire of opposing the Party and socialism.
    Shen Zhiyuan finally said: In the past thirty-two years, he grew up under the education and training of the Communist Party, and the Party gave him the opportunity to study in the Soviet Union. In the most difficult and arduous time of the democratic revolution, he shamefully became a deserter from the vanguard of the revolution. After leaving the Party, he participated in the democratic revolution again. In the difficult environment, the Communist Party still constantly gave him encouragement, education, help, and even care and consideration in life. Now he holds important positions in various fields in Shanghai, such as Vice Chairman of the CPPCC, Member of the Municipal People's Committee, Deputy Director of the Municipal Philosophy and Social Science Preparatory Committee, etc. He, who has not fundamentally reformed himself, does not make redoubled efforts for the people's cause to repay the Party, but becomes more complacent, arrogant, and even disregards the Party. In order to pursue personal fame, he repays kindness with hatred, reverses black and white, and rabidly attacks the Party. He said that he would take this mistake as the most painful lesson of his life, always rally around the Party, and under the leadership of the Party, thoroughly correct his past mistakes, cleanse his mind and reform himself, and start anew.
    Shen Zhiyuan's attitude on the 27th was somewhat changed compared to before, and the attendees asked him to continue his self-criticism.

### 沈志远在上海的初步检查中承认  他是章伯钧“两院制”的推销员  由于政治野心和追求个人名位铸成大错

    沈志远在上海的初步检查中承认
    他是章伯钧“两院制”的推销员
    由于政治野心和追求个人名位铸成大错
    本报讯　民盟上海市委主任委员、中国科学院上海经济研究所筹备处主任沈志远，27日在上海市哲学社会科学界人士座谈会上承认自己犯了反共产党反社会主义的严重错误，是一个十足的右派分子，并进行了初步检查。
    这里的哲学社会科学家们连日来先后举行了三次座谈会，对沈志远一年以来所犯的一系列错误言行和反右派斗争中的暖昧态度，提出了批评和质问。沈志远27日检查的是他犯的错误的一部分。至于有关民盟的部分，他表示将在盟内检查。
    沈志远承认大家揭发的一些事实。他说，他做了章伯钧的“两院制”的义务推销员，将章伯钧关于“两院制”的言论由北京带到上海盟内传达，还要民盟市委常委讨论研究，引起了思想混乱。沈志远承认，他犯了鼓动群众向党进攻的重大罪行。他攻击教条主义，并不是真正反对教条主义，而是攻击马列主义的思想领导。他建议改变高等学校的党委制，实质上是想取消党对高等学校的领导。他要求出版事业“向社会开放”，是为资产阶级思想的贩卖者开方便之门，他主张开放聘用人才的“自由市场”，是意味着对国家有计划的统一调配人才的社会主义人事制度的破坏。
    沈志远发言中还承认他自己为贯彻章罗联盟的反动科学纲领所犯的一些错误。
    沈志远在发言中初步检查了他产生这些错误的思想根源，是他存在着追求个人名位的思想和政治野心。他说：1949年，中央人民政府成立时，他被任命为出版总署翻译局局长，而别的许多民主人士当了副部长、大学校长，就心怀不满，附和“早革命不如迟革命，迟革命不如不革命”的流言。到上海之初，发表他当华东军政委员会参事室主任，他借口参事室工作不好办拒绝这一任命，实际上是嫌职位低。1953年当了华东行政委员会文教委员会副主任，又嫌没有实权。近二、三年来虽然舍不得放弃科学研究，但又不愿不搞社会活动，以增加政治资本。有机会就不择手段地压低党的威信，抬高民盟的地位和作用，达到与党分庭抗礼，讨价还价，以提高自己的政治地位。章伯钧提出“两院制”，他想实行时总有我沈志远一份，思想上发生共鸣。
    沈志远承认，自己在许多政治问题上表面上总是拥护党，但常常是为“看风色、观气候、投机心理”所左右。
    说到他和章罗联盟小集团的关系时，沈志远说，他们是互相利用。章罗联盟小集团分子陈仁炳等利用他操纵把持盟务，他利用他们巩固和提高自己的地位。他很欣赏陈仁炳在上海电影制片厂召开五次座谈会放火的经验，曾想在民盟工作会议上加以介绍。沈志远说，一年多来他经常阅读并偏听偏信陈仁炳、孙斯鸣主持搜集的基层的片面反映和汇报，更加助长了心中久已存在的日积月累的对党不满的情绪，再加上大鸣大放空气的刺激，和民盟基层部分落后群众要求民盟市委保证大放大鸣的压力，他的大错终于由内心的酝酿爆发为公开的行动，堕落到反党反社会主义的右派泥坑中。
    沈志远最后说：三十二年来，他在共产党的教育和培养下成长起来，党给了他留学苏联的机会。在民主革命最艰难困苦的时候，他可耻地成为革命先锋队的逃兵。脱党后他又参加了民主革命。在艰苦的环境中，共产党仍不断给他以鼓励、教育、帮助乃至于生活上的关怀照顾。现在他在上海一身兼任各方面重要职务，如政协副主席、市人民委员会委员、市哲学社会科学筹备委员会副主任等等，他这个根本没有脱胎换骨的人，根本不去为人民事业加倍努力来报答党，反而更加自满，目空一切甚至目中无党，为了追求个人名位，恩将仇报，颠倒黑白，猖狂地向党进攻。他表示，要将这次错误作为一生最惨痛的教训，永远靠拢党，在党的领导下，痛改前非，洗面革心，重新做人。
    沈志远27日态度比以前有了一些转变，到会者要求他继续检查交代。
