    I hate myself for being used by Zhang Bojun as a tool to ignite fires, supporting Huang Qixiang in implementing Zhang Bojun's path in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party.
    Li Boqiu's speech

    I. I am grateful to the Communist Party and the mass of people for the bugle call of the anti-Rightist struggle that awakened me from the mire of error. My serious mistake was, first of all, under the instructions of Zhang Bojun, convening various symposiums in Beijing to encourage free airing of views, falling into Zhang Bojun's anti-Party, anti-socialist conspiracy trap, and becoming one of Zhang Bojun's tools for spreading poison and igniting fires. Furthermore, since last year, I have supported Huang Qixiang in implementing Zhang Bojun's line in the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, leading the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party into an extremely suspicious and dangerous direction. The most obvious example is the April meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party this year, where Zhang and Huang painstakingly sought to make Huang Qixiang the vice chairman, and I was his supporter. After the meeting, Zhang Bojun wanted to "personally govern" and grasp all power in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and was attempting to recruit more "confidants" and expand significantly. Fortunately, the Party and the people promptly exposed and countered the anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy of the right-wing elements, rescuing the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party.

    II. Now, let's examine the truth of Zhang Bojun's and Huang Qixiang's activities in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and my mistakes based on several important facts.

    1. Zhang Bojun, using his position under the guise of assisting the Chinese Communist Party in rectification, directly instructed the Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to hold symposiums in six areas. Zhang Bojun said: "The Jiusan Society is doing well and is leading the way. The Central Committee of the China Democratic League and the Municipal Committee are working separately, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party should not lag behind. The Central Committee and the Municipal Committee should co-organize, and the Central Committee will support if the city lacks funds." First, he invited liaison persons from various fields who were contacted for convening the symposiums. Among them were many of Zhang Bojun's confidants, such as Zhang Shenfu, Wang Youyong, and Wang Zhenxin. Zhang Bojun said at the meeting: "To help the Chinese Communist Party in rectification, we must eliminate concerns and invite more non-Party members, including people from other parties, to participate." He also said: "Senior intellectuals have a background and fewer concerns. Middle and lower-level intellectuals have more concerns and fewer opportunities to speak, so we must also organize them to participate in symposiums. Beijing should hold more than a dozen symposiums before the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress in late June. After Beijing gets it going, the Central Committee will send people to Shanghai and other places to help the local areas get it going." Under Zhang Bojun's personal supervision, the symposiums were held very frequently, one after another. He also instructed Li Jiansheng to convene two symposiums for women in her individual capacity. Zhang thought the initial symposium report was too simple and asked the cadres to organize the records every day, highlight the problems, and rush them to Guangming Daily for publication. The content should be extensive, and it doesn't matter if it takes up a large page. Zhang Bojun attended each symposium to offer encouragement (except for the symposium for cultural workers and calligraphers and painters). Many fallacies against the Party leadership emerged at the symposiums. In particular, Hu Ming and Zhu Qixian, professors from the Normal University invited by Zhang Shenfu, made wild remarks about running schools democratically, essentially opposing the Party committee system. Today, it is clear that Zhang Bojun was coordinating with the arrangements of Guangming Daily and the China Democratic League to provoke dissatisfied elements to ignite fires, spread poison, and fuel the flames. He also attempted to expand his influence, win over dissatisfied intellectuals, and recruit all sorts of people.

    2. Simultaneously with the symposiums, Zhang Bojun and Huang Qixiang, during this period, gathered members of the Central Executive Bureau and heads of various departments of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party for meetings and meals at the Cultural Club. Even the office meetings were moved to the Cultural Club twice. Most noteworthy was the gathering on the afternoon of June 6, attended by members of the Central Executive Bureau, heads of various departments and offices, as well as Zhang Shenfu, Wang Zhenxin, Wang Youyong, Zeng Ziying, and Qiu Zhe, Yang Ziheng, Cai Yiming, and Zhan Yunqing. According to Huang Qixiang's confession in the Guangdong group of the National People's Congress, the list of participants for this gathering was determined by him and Zhang Bojun. At this time, Zhang Bojun made many fallacious remarks, mainly including the following points: (1) The democratic parties should develop two to three million members, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party can develop to twenty to thirty thousand this year, and in the future, not only should the counties develop, but also the rural areas. (2) The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party has a set of assets—that is, experienced veterans of political activities. Those who have lost contact in the past must all be recruited back. Those who have been through labor reform or served their sentences can all come, and people from the "Old Three Parties" must all be arranged for. (3) He instructed Zhang Yunchuan to go to Zhengzhou to develop the organization (Zhang left Beijing for Zhengzhou on the 7th). (4) "Zhonghua Forum" must be established immediately, to be run by Zhang Shenfu and He Zhongmin. (5) A policy research committee should be established, with seventy to eighty experts and senior intellectuals participating. Judging from the materials revealed from various aspects recently, Zhang Bojun was precisely at the most intense time of his anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities during those days. He was about to introduce more "confidants" to take control of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, further develop the organization, and expand publicity to expand influence and prepare for greater "capital."

    3. Zhang Bojun had been preoccupied with establishing "Zhonghua Forum" since last year. When Zhang Bojun returned from Beidaihe, he often invited senior intellectuals from the Central Committee and local areas of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to talk extensively about changing propaganda work, first changing "Study Correspondence" to "Progress Newspaper." At the same time, he wanted to revive "Zhonghua Forum," which had been run in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War, and personally edit it into "Oriental Magazine." He often said that He Zhongmin, Qiu Elun, Ding Fangtuo, and Wu Menghui should participate in the editorial work. We did not agree with this approach and requested the establishment of a journal preparatory group, with Li Boqiu, Yan Xinmin, Huang Shanji, Xia Kangnong, Xu Binu, and Zhang Yunchuan nominated by the Executive Bureau meeting to form the group. A meeting was held, and preliminary exchanges of views took place. (Wu Menghui recorded) After the group discussion, I consulted with He Zhongmin, Qiu Elun, and Zhang Yukang, and compiled the group's records into a journal plan outline for discussion. I discussed this draft journal plan outline with comrades when I inspected Guangdong and Shanghai. Most agreed that it should be a publication for studying Marxist-Leninist theory, helping ideological transformation, and combining theory with practice to analyze current events and policies. However, it was completely different from Zhang's opinion, and Zhang ignored it and still talked about his own set of "Zhonghua Forum." This year, Zhang wanted to get it up and running as soon as possible and revealed his intention to have Zhang Shenfu and He Zhongmin run it.

    4. Regarding the "Policy Research Committee" issue. According to the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, a preparatory committee for the Delegates' Congress was to be established. The Central Executive Bureau also decided to establish a preparatory group for the Delegates' Congress. However, because Zhang did not want to establish a preparatory committee, he wanted to set up a policy committee, and Huang Qixiang made this group idle and disbanded it. Later, because we opposed Zhang, he still insisted on his own opinion, but changed it to a policy research committee. During the National Work Conference in March, he said at the meeting that he wanted to move the method of setting up several committees in the China Democratic League over. Once, he invited members of the Executive Bureau to talk and expressed that he wanted to arrange for Zhang Yunchuan and He Shikun to each preside over a committee. Later, because Zhang and He disagreed with him on the election of the vice chairman at the Third Plenary Session, the matter was put on hold. This meeting was scheduled to establish a preparatory committee for the Delegates' Congress. Zhang had no choice but to insist on only members of the Central Executive Bureau as members of the preparatory committee and refused to add people. In fact, Zhang Bojun did not want to convene the Delegates' Congress; he wanted to cancel the preparatory work. He insisted on establishing a policy research committee, and Huang Qixiang said that Zhang did not agree with the number of cadres distributed in consultation with the various departments and offices and wanted to reserve more places for him to arrange. Obviously, Zhang Bojun at this time was trying his best to arrange people in his pocket and was preparing to recruit all sorts of people so that he could do whatever he wanted in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party.

    5. Regarding the issue of electing Huang Qixiang as vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party at the Third Plenary Session. I returned to Beijing from Shanghai in mid-January, and Huang Qixiang immediately asked me to talk at his home about the related issues of members of the CPPCC, members of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC, members of the Standing Committee of the NPC, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and secretary-general. He said, "Comrade Xu Bing asked about filling vacancies for members of the CPPCC." He also said, "I have discussed this matter with Comrade Tong Zechen and believe that solving the vice-chairman issue is not difficult, but solving the secretary-general issue is more difficult." Huang asked me to agree to resolve the vice-chairman and secretary-general issues in two separate meetings in the future. He also stated that if he became vice-chairman and a member of the Standing Committee of the NPC, he could give up the positions of deputy director of the Sports Commission and member of the Legislative Affairs Committee. Another time, Huang invited Zechen and me to Huang's home, and we still talked about this series of issues. Zechen said to Huang's face that Huang's vice-chairmanship was not a problem and said, "I originally thought that Boqiu could be recommended as secretary-general, but this is difficult. Boqiu should humbly examine himself." I was very grateful for Zechen's criticism at the time. When I went to Zechen's home again, I expressed that I wanted to support Ji Lao as vice-chairman. If that could not be realized for the time being, Ji Lao could be secretary-general, and if he was still in Nanjing, I would act on his behalf. I also proposed that Ji Lao be a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC. Zechen and I also talked about how to unite progressive elements and properly arrange for them in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. I insisted on asking Wang Shenlin to get rid of his Shandong work and work full-time for the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party since last summer, so I fully agreed with Zechen's arrangement opinions. However, later, when negotiating the nomination of members of the CPPCC, my opinions that I had discussed with Zechen were rejected by Zhang Bojun. During the National Work Conference of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zechen fell ill. Before Zechen fell ill, he told me that he had suggested to Zhang to invite some responsible comrades to discuss the issues to be resolved at the Third Plenary Session, but Zhang was unwilling to talk. During the April meeting, Shenlin and Xinmin adopted a passive attitude, and I was in an isolated situation. Zhang Bojun arbitrarily issued instructions. On the day before the election, Zhang Bojun formally nominated Huang Qixiang as vice-chairman and Yang Yitang and Wang Yifan as members of the Executive Bureau. At that time, Zhang Yunchuan, on behalf of He Shikun, submitted a written statement pointing out that Huang Qixiang's relationship with Yang Hu had not been explained and firmly opposed the election of the vice-chairman, causing a heated debate. However, Zhang declared: "Make a resolution first, hand over everything to Zhang Bojun for full authority, and then deliberate on the election." At that time, I opposed making such a resolution on the one hand, but vigorously supported Huang Qixiang as vice-chairman on the other hand. Today, it seems that this was another big mistake I made in falling into the trap of Zhang and Huang.

    6. Regarding the development of the organization and the handling of cadres. Zhang Bojun strongly proposed the large-scale development of the organization after returning from Beidaihe. He advocated breaking the "defense zone system" and advocated all-round and unlimited development at the upper, middle, and lower levels, among youth, and in large, medium, and small cities. He was dissatisfied with the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party's focused development, mainly among the middle and upper levels and in large and medium-sized cities. However, he greatly appreciated the development in Tianjin. Although I insisted on developing the organization in Beijing mainly in the medical field and on the original foundation, and on cultivating backbones, uniting the middle, and facing the backward in the work, the mass work focused on facing the backward, and I appreciated the network-style development, which has increased by one and a half times from last year to May this year. This was echoing Zhang Bojun. At this year's National Work Conference, Zhang Bojun talked about the fallacy of "large-scale development" with even greater enthusiasm. The resolution of the National Work Conference, in addition to adhering to the principle of focusing on the key points, the original foundation, and the middle and upper levels, also accepted Zhang Bojun's opinion to develop towards the cultural, art, and craft fields. Moreover, organizations should be developed in large and medium-sized cities without organizations, and organizations can also be developed in small cities according to possibility and necessity, which paved the way for Zhang Bojun's large-scale development. Large-scale development requires a large number of cadres. At the National Work Conference, the responsible cadres of local organizations suggested that the central government can transfer current cadres from various places to support the new organizational work of the central government. However, Zhang Bojun was unwilling to transfer cadres according to the organizational system, but instead took out dozens of so-called "Old Three Parties" lists from his pocket. There was no shortage of people who had been through labor reform or sentenced. He regarded these people as having political experience. Zhang Bojun planned to arrange Lian Ruiqi as the first deputy chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee and Liu Zongkuan as the chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Committee before going abroad last year. Later, after the opposition of local comrades, Liu Zongkuan was changed to deputy chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee, and Lian Ruiqi was promoted to a member of the CPPCC. According to Wang Yifan's confession, Zhang Bojun asked him to rectify Mei Rixin and Liao Shao after he went to Guangdong and Jiangxi. During the April meeting this year, he greatly promoted cadres from various places. After the meeting, he asked Cai Yiming and Zhan Yunqing to come to Beijing for face-to-face talks. Zhang Bojun verbally said that he wanted Communist Party members to participate in the work of the democratic parties, but in reality, he wanted to use it as a "smoke screen." According to Huang Qixiang's confession in the Guangdong group of the National People's Congress, Zhang and Huang were discussing inviting Comrade Xu Binu to be the secretary-general of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in May. However, after consulting the United Front Work Department, they believed that he could be appointed as a deputy. On June 5, they also discussed appointing Xu Binu as deputy secretary-general. This was obviously Zhang Bojun's trick to deepen the "protective color of the poisonous snake." Zhang Bojun often used treacherous, sinister, and two-faced tactics in the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. He often vilified Zhang Yunchuan, accusing him of being an activist, saying that he was scolding him, and saying that Zhang Yunchuan wrote a letter scolding him for being Shi Jingtang, who sold the Party for glory, and was furious. After Zhang and He quarreled with Huang Qixiang in October last year, Zhang Bojun also found Wang Shenlin, Yan Xinmin, and me to talk about pretending to rectify Zhang and He, which were all methods to cover up his anti-communist face with Zhang Yunchuan.

    7. The most shameful and abominable thing about Zhang Bojun is his consistent anti-Soviet, anti-communist stance and hatred of Stalin. According to Zhang Bojun's confession in the inspection group, he had cooperated with the traitor Ye Qing as early as 1930, but only stopped because Li and Ji told him that Ye Qing had even sold his wife. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Third Party introduced two Trotskyists, Zhu Daijie and Zhu Jingtao, to serve as members of the Central Committee at the meeting held in Wuhan, and cursed Stalin as the biggest bureaucrat in the world. Zhang Bojun also confessed that he had contact with Chen Duxiu at that time and had communicated with Chen Gongbo. Since last year, he has been even more unscrupulous in his anti-Soviet and anti-communist stance, vilifying Stalin and maliciously slandering Soviet leaders. He described the Beria incident as a factional struggle. He compared the great victory of the Chinese Communist Party's leadership in the Chinese revolution to Liu Bang's imperial career in the Han Dynasty. He also thought that Chiang Kai-shek was too stupid and that Marshall had not done a good job in the China Democratic League. He boasted about the merits of the China Democratic League to show that Zhang and Luo were "heroes." He superficially praised Chairman Mao but essentially slandered him. He thought that Chairman Mao benefited from the "Four Books" and "Zizhi Tongjian." Russia simply did not have Chinese "culture." Zhang Bojun criticized Liu Shaoqi's political report at the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, regarding the analysis of the social foundation of the democratic parties and Minister Li Weihan's speech, as "dogmatism." On June 9, he also said at Huang Qixiang's home: At the State Council meeting on the 7th, when discussing the issue of population survey and statistics, Bao Mou criticized how sharply, ridiculing Premier Zhou for being "embarrassed on the spot and unable to answer." Zhang Bojun was even more inhumanely and viciously stabbing in the back at the responsible cadres of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. He often provoked one person today and attacked another tomorrow. Zhang Bojun was most resentful of those who had working relationships and direct contact with the United Front Work Department since last year. Once last year, he pointed to me, Shenlin, Xinmin, etc. at Huang Qixiang's home and said: "Which one of you has not accused me to the United Front Work Department! I'm afraid only Huang Qixiang hasn't." Zhang often used Huang Qixiang to deal with us. Huang was superficially more amiable than Zhang, but he implemented Zhang Bojun's intentions and gradually led the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party onto an extremely suspicious and dangerous path according to all of Zhang Bojun's arrangements. If the Communist Party and the people had not promptly counterattacked the right-wing elements, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party would have faced even more serious dangers.

    Here, I offer my hope to Huang Qixiang: Since you have vowed to fight Zhang Bojun's line to the end, you should thoroughly expose what Zhang Bojun's real intention was in asking you to carry out his work? What did you yourself ask of Zhang? You used to fool around under Chiang Kai-shek, and later went to Germany to serve as a reactionary military delegation. After returning to China, you took a big detour to Hong Kong. Many comrades opposed your actions, but Zhang Bojun supported you. Zhang Bojun has been relying on you to run the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in recent years. What is the secret agreement between Zhang Bojun and you? You also have a very close relationship with Huang Shaohong. You must honestly confess and thoroughly expose everything.

    (III) How do I now recognize my mistakes?

    My sins are unforgivable! I am heartbroken, and I have failed the trust of the Party and the people. Self-righteous subjectivism and base personal power ideology blinded my eyes, made me a tool for Zhang Bojun to ignite fires, and fell into the mire of the right-wing elements' conspiracy without realizing it. Now I thank the Party for awakening me and saving me, and I thank the comrades for criticizing me. I am determined to thoroughly transform myself under the leadership of the Party, resolutely fight the right-wing elements to the end, and accept a rigorous political test.

    First of all, I reflect that self-righteous subjectivism has seriously harmed myself and damaged the socialist cause. My understanding of internal contradictions among the people is wrong, subjective, and one-sided. I believe that antagonistic class contradictions have basically been transformed into non-antagonistic ones. The class struggle is over, and the only problems in the future are ideological problems. Therefore, I emphasize expanding democratic life, believing that we must expand democratic life to further implement the leadership of the Communist Party, and only by guiding the masses in democratic political life can we carry out ideological transformation. When the Chinese Communist Party's rectification movement began, the Party called on all democratic parties and non-party members to help with rectification. I believe that we can strive to contact the masses, collect opinions, and play a helpful role. Therefore, when Zhang Bojun arranged for the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to hold symposiums in six areas, I was completely unaware of his ulterior motives, and only felt that he was arranging it too hastily and too much. After the symposiums began, I completely let go and allowed the liaison persons from all fields to determine the list of participants (many of the liaison persons were appointed by Zhang Bojun) and set the time. In the initial stage, I was worried that the masses had concerns, so I always encouraged free airing of views and breaking down concerns. I also pointed out that correct opinions should be resolved, and incorrect opinions should also be explained. After the records were organized, all the problems were ranked and discussed with the relevant units. If they could be resolved, they would be resolved. If there were cases where they should be released but were not released, or should be changed but were not changed, I would reflect them to the higher-level Party committees, and they would definitely implement the principle of releasing and changing. I asked those who participated in the symposiums to believe in the Communist Party, promote the three loves: love the Communist Party, love the country, and love socialism, and to be realistic and freely air their views regarding the three evils. Regarding the dissatisfaction and some fallacies hostile to the Party and socialism that appeared at the symposiums, I also believed that we should let the poisonous weeds grow out and then criticize and eliminate them. When analyzing the ideological situation of the symposiums with the cadres, I also emphasized that with the strong leadership of the Communist Party, the solid socialist economic foundation, and the solid people's democratic dictatorship, we are not afraid of countercurrents. All these views and statements have become right-wing elements provoking dissatisfaction and fueling the flames. They fully demonstrate a situation of ambiguous stance and extremely serious right-leaning paralysis in politics and ideology. Therefore, I lost political vigilance, not only could not see Zhang Bojun's conspiracy, but also unconsciously walked into Zhang Bojun's trap and became a tool for him to ignite fires and spread poison.

    I also reflect that after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, as a young man, I devoted myself to the Third Road, and the backward roots are very deep. Although I later realized that there was only a way out by following the Communist Party, I have not undergone strict revolutionary class education since participating in revolutionary work, my thinking has not been transformed well, and I have also carried a progressive baggage, being arrogant and self-righteous. These various bourgeois consciousnesses seize every opportunity to emerge. Not seeing the class struggle and wrongly recognizing it is a bourgeois viewpoint. This viewpoint blinded myself, and I derived an erroneous view from the feedback of intellectuals during the inspections last winter and this spring: that is, some organs have serious sectarianism, and some Communist Party members are stained with the privileged thinking of the ruling class. Therefore, I understood some people's dissatisfaction and resentment towards the leadership as a phenomenon that was bound to occur under the circumstances of carrying out the rectification movement and freely airing views. Coupled with the bad idea of seeking performance, I believed that the China Democratic League had played an active role in the adjustment of departments and teaching reforms in the past and had been valued by the Ministry of Higher Education. After the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party focused on the medical and health field, I often hoped to have the opportunity to play a role and show off. Therefore, this time I attached great importance to the feedback from the medical and health field. Regarding the joint clinics in various districts and the issue of adjusting drug prices and consultation fees for practicing physicians, I planned to synthesize the opinions from the symposiums in various districts, add investigation and analysis, and then submit them to the health authorities.

    What I often felt distressed about in the work of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party was that the political tasks were heavy, but there were few people doing the work. Comrades who were basically consistent in their political attitudes often had conflicts in their work attitudes and ways of thinking. For the problems that should be solved in the work attitude, we often cannot take a consistent and proactive approach. On the contrary, some problems were solved by Huang Qixiang coming out to communicate opinions and provide support. The issue of Zhong Dai serving as deputy minister of the Organization Department was resolved by Huang Qixiang's proposal and insistence. I believe this is a good thing that is beneficial to the work. I myself also believe that the responsibilities I have assumed in the past few years are disproportionate to the position I am in, which has increased the difficulty of the work. If I continue to undertake work tasks in the future, I should be the secretary-general in addition to Ji Fang. However, recently, because the United Front Work Department has repeatedly stated that it will not interfere in the internal affairs of the democratic parties, Zhang Bojun has become even more unscrupulous in his two-faced tactics. After the April meeting of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Zhang immediately reversed right and wrong, provoked and said to Huang Qixiang: "It was Ji Fang who opposed you." At the same time, he persuaded Wang Shenlin to take leave to rest in Qingdao, intending to exclude me from the Central Committee, suppress the issue of the secretary-general that should be resolved, and released a vicious trick to Yang Yitang, saying that he wanted to suggest that I go to Beijing as the deputy mayor. These are all things that make me angry. But since that is the case, why did I fall into his trap? I should dig out the inferior roots buried deep in my thinking. This is none other than wholeheartedly wanting to solve the secretary-general problem. I believe that solving this problem not only unlocks the key to the work, but also satisfies my personal power ideology. I wrongly thought that I could communicate the opinions of various comrades through Huang Qixiang, and I thought that comrades such as Xu Binu would definitely support me. Therefore, I hoped that Huang Qixiang would solicit more opinions from Binu and others, and at the same time, I tried to reduce Zhang Bojun's suspicion. Although I was very dissatisfied with Zhang Bojun in my heart, I still had to succumb to Zhang Bojun's open and legal status and power, and I still listened to his instructions on the work he arranged. I thought that my work was active and responsible, and Huang's words to Zhang would make it easier to solve the secretary-general problem. Such thinking obviously ignores the struggle of political principles and falls into personnel circles. Moreover, I completely made wrong estimates of the development of internal contradictions among the people and the development of the rectification movement. I completely underestimated the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements on the Party and socialism, and I only regarded Zhang Bojun as a blackmailing rogue politician. I did not estimate the set of conspiracy activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance and his ambitious practices. Therefore, I only regarded the remarks of Zhang Bojun and other right-wing elements as absurd rantings. I served as a tool for Zhang Bojun's anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist political conspiracy, and I still thought that I had always been determined to be loyal to the leadership of the Party, loyal to socialism, and loyal to the people's democratic dictatorship. Moreover, the Party and the people gave me great trust, which was fundamentally different from Zhang Bojun and other right-wing elements. I did not consciously realize that precisely at the tense moment of the conspiracy activities of the right-wing elements attacking the Party, the people, and socialism, I did bad things that undermined the leadership of the Party and undermined socialism. After the anti-rightist struggle was launched, I still did not realize the seriousness of the struggle between the two roads, and I was still worried that Zhang Bojun might pass the test in the background, so the initial struggle was not firm enough, and I did not realize my mistakes. I am really heartbroken and have nowhere to hide, heartbroken that I fell into the mire of the right-wing conspiracy. Every time I think of failing the trust of the Party and the people, I want to cry. But I am determined to undergo tests in the anti-rightist political struggle, resolutely fight the right-wing elements to the end under the leadership of the Party, and draw a line with Zhang Bojun and others in politics and ideology. I am determined to thoroughly transform myself in the actual struggle of socialism, closely relying on the leadership of the Party and the supervision of the working people, and the tempering of labor life.

    I sincerely accept the exposure and criticism of the masses to recognize my mistakes. But if there are any inconsistencies with the facts, please allow me to request an examination of the true situation and give me severe education!

### 我痛恨自己给章伯钧利用作点火的工具，支持了黄琪翔在农工民主党执行章伯钧的道路  李伯球的发言

专栏：

    我痛恨自己给章伯钧利用作点火的工具，支持了黄琪翔在农工民主党执行章伯钧的道路
    李伯球的发言
    一、我感激共产党和人民群众反右派斗争的号角把我从错误的泥坑里警醒。我的严重错误首先是受章伯钧的指使，在北京市召开了各种座谈会，鼓励大鸣大放，上了章伯钧反党、反社会主义阴谋的圈套，变为章伯钧放毒、点火的工具之一。并且在去年以来，支持了黄琪翔在农工党中央执行章伯钧的路线，把农工党引入极可疑的、危险的方向。最明显的是今年农工民主党四月会议，章、黄处心积虑要实现黄琪翔的副主席，我做了他的支持者。会议以后，章伯钧在农工民主党要“亲政”要掌握全部权力，正企图更多地引用“心腹”，进行大发展。所幸党和人民及时揭发和反击右派分子反党、反社会主义的阴谋，把农工党挽救过来。
    二、现在从几件重要的事实来看看章伯钧、黄琪翔在农工民主党活动的真相和我的错误。
    1．章伯钧利用他的地位假借帮助中共整风，直接指使农工民主党中央和北京市委员会举行六个方面的座谈会。章伯钧说：“九三做得好，走在前头。民盟中央同市委正在分头搞，农工民主党也不应落后。中央和市委合办，市没有钱中央支持。”首先邀集了为召开座谈会而联系的各方面联络人。其中就有不少章伯钧的心腹，如张申府、王又庸、王枕心等。章伯钧在会上说：“帮助中共整风，要破除顾虑，多邀集农工党外人士包括其他党派的人来参加。”并说：“高级知识分子都有来头，顾虑少。中下层知识分子顾虑多，说话的机会又少，也要组织他们座谈。北京市要在六月底，人大四次会议前开十几个座谈会。北京搞开了，中央要派人到上海各地去帮助地方搞。”在章伯钧亲自督促之下，座谈会开得很常，一次接一次。他还指使李健生用个人名义召开了两次妇女界座谈。初次座谈报道，章认为太简单，要求干部每天整理记录，把问题突出来赶给光明日报发表。内容要多，占版面不妨大。每一方面座谈会章伯钧都来作一番鼓励（只有文化工作者和书画家座谈会章未到）。座谈会上出现了不少反党领导的谬论。尤其是张申府邀集来的师大教授胡明、朱启贤等，大发民主办校实质上反对党委制的狂言。今天来看显然章伯钧是配合光明日报和民盟的布置，来挑拨不满分子去点火、放毒、推波助浪。并还企图扩大他的影响，拉拢不满的知识分子，收罗“三教九流”。
      2．与开座谈会同时，章伯钧、黄琪翔在这时期，约集农工民主党中央执行局委员各部门负责人，在文化俱乐部会谈吃饭。连办公会议也移到文化俱乐部开了两次。最值得注意的是六月六日下午的集会，参加的人除中央执行局委员、各部、处负责人以外，还有张申府、王枕心、王又庸、曾子英以及丘哲、杨子恒、蔡一鸣、詹云青。据黄琪翔在人大广东小组交代说这次集会的名单是他与章伯钧商定的。这一次章伯钧大发谬言，主要有如下几点：（1）民主党派发展二、三百万，农工民主党今年就可以发展到二、三万人，将来不仅县要发展；还要发展到农村去。（2）农工党有一套资本——即有政治活动经验的老人。过去失去联系的现在都要收罗回来。劳改的、办刑的期满了都可以来，“老三党”的人都要得到安排。（3）交代张云川到郑州去发展组织（张于七日离京赴郑）。（4）要马上办“中华论坛”，由张申府、何仲珉来办。（5）成立政策研究委员会，要七、八十位专家、高级知识分子参加。从近来各方面揭露出来的材料看章伯钧那几天正是反党、反社会主义阴谋活动最紧张的时候。他正要引进更多的“心腹”来掌握农工党中央，进一步发展组织扩大宣传，来扩大影响，准备更大的“资本”。
    3．章伯钧去年以来就念念不忘办“中华论坛”，章伯钧由北戴河回来时，常常邀集农工党中央和地方来的高级知识分子大谈改变宣传工作，首先要把“学习通讯”改为“前进报”。同时又要复办抗日时期重庆办过的“中华论坛”，并要亲自主编办成“东方杂志”。经常说要何仲珉、丘锷仑、丁方拓、吴孟辉参加编辑工作。我们不同意这样办，要求建立期刊筹备小组，并由执行局会议推定李伯球、严信民、黄善继、夏康农、徐彬如、张云川组成小组。曾召开过一次会，初步的交换了意见。（吴孟辉记录）小组谈后，我曾约何仲珉、丘锷仑、张育康谈，将小组记录综合成期刊计划大纲以供讨论。这种期刊计划大纲初稿，我到广东、上海视察曾约集同志们讨论。大致都同意办成为学习马列主义理论、帮助思想改造结合实际来分析时事政策的刊物。但与章的意见完全不同，章即置之不理，还是谈他自己一套的“中华论坛”。到了今年章更要早日办起来，并露出心底要张申府、何仲珉来办了。
    4．关于“政策研究委员会”问题。按照农工党中央委员会第二次全体会议决议，是要成立党员代表筹备委员会。中央执行局亦决定成立代表大会筹备小组。但因章不愿建立筹备委员会，要设一政策委员会，黄琪翔就让这个小组无事可做而解散。以后因我们反对章仍然坚持自己的意见，不过改为政策研究委员会而已。三月间，全国工作会议时，他在会上说要把在民盟设立几个委员会的办法搬过来。有一次他邀集执行局的人谈表示要安排张云川、何世琨各主持一个委员会。后来因张、何在三中全会反对选副主席上同他发生了争执，问题才搁下来。这次会议预定要成立党员代表大会筹备委员会，章无可奈何，又坚持只以中央执行局委员为筹委拒绝增加人，其实章伯钧是不愿召开代表大会的，他要使筹备工作取消。一定要设立政策研究委员会，对于各部、处协商分配的干部名额，黄琪翔说章不同意，要多留名额给他安排。显然章伯钧这时候是要竭力安排他腰包里的人，并准备收罗“三教九流”的人物，以便在农工党为所欲为。
    5．关于三中全会选黄琪翔为农工党中央委员会副主席问题。我一月中由上海回到北京，黄琪翔即找我到他家里谈，关于政协委员、政协常委、人大常委、农工党中央副主席、秘书长相关的问题。他说：“徐冰同志问到政协委员补缺问题。”他又说：“同则沉同志商量过此事，认为解决副主席不困难，解决秘书长困难就大。”黄要求我同意将来开会把副主席和秘书长分开两次会来解决。并表示当了副主席、人大常委，那末体委副主任、法案委员都可让出来。又一次是黄约则沉和我到黄家，仍然谈关于这一连串问题。则沉当面说黄的副主席没问题，并说：“我本来认为秘书长可推伯球，但这有困难，伯球要好好虚心检查自己。”我当时很感激则沉的批评。我再到则沉家时表示要支持季老任副主席，如一时未实现，由季老任秘书长，他如仍在南京则我代他。并提出季老任政协常委。我和则沉还谈到在农工党如何团结进步分子，并适当安排问题。我在去年夏即坚持要求王深林摆脱山东工作专任农工党中央事，所以对则沉的安排意见，我完全同意。但后来协商政协委员提名时，我坚持同则沉谈过的意见都被章伯钧拒绝了。在农工党全国工作会议时则沉病了。则沉病前告诉我他曾向章建议约一些负责同志商量三中全会要解决的问题，章不愿谈。四月会议时深林、信民采取消极态度，我处于孤立的境地。章伯钧任意发纵指使。临到选举前一天，章伯钧才正式提名黄琪翔为副主席，杨逸棠、王一帆为执行局委员。当时张云川代何世琨提出书面指出黄琪翔与杨虎关系未交代，坚决反对选副主席，引起激烈的争论。章却宣称：“先作出决议，一切交章伯钧全权办理，然后再酝酿选举。”我当时一面反对作出这样的决议，一面却极力支持黄琪翔为副主席。今天看来，这又是我上章、黄圈套的一个大错误。
    6．关于发展组织和处理干部问题。章伯钧强烈地提出大发展组织是在北戴河回来之后。他主张打破“防区制”，主张上中下层、青年、大中小城市，全面地无限地发展。他对农工党有重点的、以中上层、大中城市为主的发展工作是不满意的。他对天津的发展却大为赞赏。我在北京市发展组织虽然坚持医药界和原有基础的发展为主，并在工作上以培养骨干，团结中间，面向落后为原则。但群众工作偏重面向落后，并赞赏撒网式的发展，去年到今年五月以前，即发展了一倍半。这是附和了章伯钧的。到了今年全国工作会议，章伯钧“大发展”的谬论更谈得有劲头。全国工作会议的决议，除了坚持重点和原有基础、中上层为主的方针以外，还接受了章伯钧的意见要向文化界美术工艺等方面发展。并且要在没有组织的大、中城市都发展，小城市也可以根据可能与必要发展组织，这就为章伯钧的大发展开辟了道路。大发展就要有一大批干部，在全国工作会议中，各地组织的负责干部建议，各地可以现职干部由中央调来支持中央新建组织工作。但章伯钧不愿按照组织系统去抽调干部，而从自己的腰包里提出几十个所谓“老三党”名单。劳改过的、判过刑的无所不有。以这些人为有政治经验。章伯钧去年将出国前即打算安排连瑞琦为上海市委第一副主委，刘宗宽为重庆市主委。后来经当地同志反对，才把刘宗宽改为四川省委副主委，把连瑞琦提为政协委员。据王一帆交代，章伯钧当他去广东、江西时要他去整一整梅日新和廖少议。今年四月会议期间，对各地干部则大加拉拔。会议后又要蔡一鸣、詹云青来京面谈。章伯钧口头上说要共产党员来参加民主党派工作，但实际上是想利用来作“掩眼法”。据黄琪翔在人大广东小组交代，五月间章、黄正商量要请徐彬如同志来作农工党中央秘书长。但征询统战部以后，他们认为可改任副的。六月五日，他们还商量要徐彬如任副秘书长的事。这显然是章伯钧为了加深“毒蛇的保护色”的诡计。章伯钧在农工民主党中央常常用奸险阴狠的一打一拉的两面手法。他常常把张云川丑诋积极分子，说成是骂他，并说张云川写信骂过他是卖党求荣的石敬塘，而发怒。去年十月间张、何同黄琪翔争嘈后，章伯钧还找王深林、严信民和我等谈假装要整张、何，这些都是借以掩盖自己同张云川同样反共面目的手法。
    7．章伯钧最可耻又最可恶的是一贯地反苏反共、仇恨斯大林，据章伯钧自己在检查小组供认远在一九三○年曾经同叛徒叶青合作过，只因李、季告诉他叶青连妻子都出卖才作罢。抗日战争时期，第三党在武汉召开的会议上引进了朱代杰、朱静陶两个托派来做中委；大骂斯大林是世界上最大的官僚主义。章伯钧还供认，那时候同陈独秀来往，同陈公博也通声气。去年来反苏反共更无忌惮，丑诋斯大林，恶意中伤苏联的领导人员。他把贝利亚事件说成是派系斗争。把中国共产党领导中国革命伟大的胜利比汉朝刘邦的帝业。并且以为蒋介石太愚蠢了，马歇尔没有做好民盟的工作等。夸耀民盟的功劳来显示章、罗是“英雄”。对于毛主席表面颂扬，实质上是诋毁。他以为毛主席得力于“四书”和“资治通鉴”。俄国就是没有中国“文化”。章伯钧对刘少奇委员长在中共八大的政治报告，关于民主党派在社会基础的分析和李维汉部长的发言，诋为“教条主义”。六月九日还在黄琪翔家里说：七日国务院会议上，讨论人口调查统计工作问题时，包某批评如何尖锐，讥笑周总理“当场难堪，无话可答”。章伯钧对于农工党中央负责干部，更是毫无人性的、恶毒地明枪暗箭。今天向这个挑挑，明天又抢这个打那个。去年以来同统战部有工作关系、直接来往的，章伯钧是最疾忌的。去年有一次在黄琪翔家里指着我和深林、信民等说：“你们那一个没有向统战部控告我呢！恐怕只有黄琪翔没有。”章又常常通过黄琪翔来对付我们。黄表面比章和善，但是他执行了章伯钧的意图，并使农工民主党按照章伯钧的一切布置，逐步走上极可疑的和危险的道路。如果不是共产党和人民及时地对右派分子反击，农工民主党将面临更严重的危险。
    这里，我对黄琪翔提出希望：你既然立誓要和章伯钧路线斗争到底；你就应该把章伯钧要你执行工作的真实企图是什么？你自己要求于章的又是什么？彻底揭发出来。你过去投到蒋介石下面鬼混，以后到德国去做反动的军事代表团，回国后又绕了很大圈子才到香港，很多同志都反对你这种种行动，但章伯钧是支持你的，这几年章伯钧又依靠你来搞农工民主党，章伯钧同你到底密契的是什么？你同黄绍竑又是来往很密切的。你必须老老实实交代彻底揭发。
    （三）我现在怎样认识自己的错误呢？
    我的罪过是不可饶恕的！我痛心、我辜负了党和人民的信任。自以为是的主观主义，卑劣的个人权位思想，蒙蔽了自己的眼睛，做了章伯钧点火的工具，掉下右派分子阴谋的污泥坑里而不自觉。现在我感谢党警醒了我，挽救了我，感谢同志们批判我。我决心要在党领导下彻底改造自己，坚决地同右派分子斗争到底，并接受严肃的政治考验。
    首先我反省到自以为是的主观主义严重地害了自己，损害了社会主义事业。对于人民内部矛盾的认识就是错误的、主观片面的。以为对抗性的阶级矛盾，基本上已经转化为非对抗性的了。阶级斗争结束了，今后问题只是思想问题。因此强调扩大民主生活，认为要扩大民主生活中，来进一步贯彻共产党的领导，也只有引导群众在民主的政治生活中，进行思想改造。中共整风运动开始，党号召各民主党派、无党派人士帮助整风。我认为可以努力联系群众，搜集意见，来发挥帮助的作用。所以章伯钧布置农工党六个方面的座谈会，我完全没有警惕到他别有用心，只嫌他布置得太急、太多而已。座谈会开始进行后，完全放手各方面给联系人去定名单，（联系人中很多章伯钧指定的）定时间。初期还担心群众有顾虑，总是鼓励鸣放，打破顾虑。并指出意见对的要求得到解决，意见不对的也要有交代说明。记录整理出来，把所有问题排队同有关单位商量，可解决的解决，下面如有当放不放或当改不改的，反映到上级党委，一定会贯彻放、贯彻改的方针。要求参加座谈的人相信共产党，发扬三爱：爱共产党、爱国家、爱社会主义，针对三害，实事求是，大鸣大放。对于座谈会出现的不满情绪和有些对党对社会主义怀着敌意的谬论，还认为毒草也让它长出来，再加批判和消除。同干部分析座谈会的思想情况时，还强调有坚强的共产党领导，巩固的社会主义经济基础，巩固的人民民主专政，不怕逆流。所有这些看法和说法都成为右派分子挑引不满推波助浪了。都是充分表现立场模糊，政治上思想上右倾麻痹十分严重的情况。所以丧失政治警惕，不仅看不见章伯钧的阴谋，并且不自觉地走上了章伯钧的圈套，变为替他点火、放毒的工具。
    我又反省到一九二七大革命失败后，以一个青年投身于第三条道路，落后的根是很深的。后来虽已觉悟到只有跟共产党走才有出路；但参加革命工作以来没有经过严格的革命的阶级教育，思想没有改造好；并且背了进步包袱，自高自大、自以为是。这种种资产阶级的意识随时找机会冒出来。看不见阶级斗争错误认识就是资产阶级观点。这种观点蒙蔽了自己，并且从去冬视察和今春以来知识分子的反映中得出一个错误的看法：那就是认为有些机关宗派主义严重，有些共产党员沾染了统治阶级的特权思想。因此把有些人对领导的不满情绪和反感，理解为在整风运动开展鸣放的情况下必然有的现象。加上好求表现的恶劣思想，认为民盟过去对院系调整、教学改革发挥了积极作用，得到高教部的重视。农工党以医卫界为重点以后，常常希望能有机会，发挥作用来表现一番。所以这次我极重视医卫界的反映，对各区联合诊所，开业医师，关于药价诊费调整问题，打算向综合各区座谈意见，再加调查和分析，然后向卫生机关提出来。
    我在农工党工作中经常感到苦恼的是：政治任务重，做工作的人少。政治上基本态度一致的同志，在工作态度和思想方法方面，又常常发生矛盾。对于工作态度上应该解决的问题，常常不能采取一致的主动的办法。反过来有些问题由黄琪翔出来沟通意见和支持得到了解决。钟岱任组织部副部长问题就是由黄琪翔提出及坚持而解决的。我认为这是对工作有利的好事。我自己更认为几年来所负的责任同所处的职位不相称，增加了工作上的困难。今后还要继续担任工作任务，除季方以外就应该由我来担任秘书长。但近来因统战部对民主党派内部的内部事务一再表示不过问，章伯钧对我们更肆无忌惮地一打一拉。农工党四月会议后，章立即颠倒是非，进行挑拨对黄琪翔说：“反对你的是季方。”同时又劝王深林请假去青岛休息，立意要把我排斥出中央，把应该解决的秘书长问题压住不解决，并对杨逸棠放出恶毒的诡计，说要建议我去北京市当副市长。这些都是使我愤怒的。但是既然如此，为什么我还上了他的圈套呢？我应该挖出埋藏在我思想深处的劣根来。这不是别的：而是全心想求得秘书长问题的解决。我认为解决这个问题，既打开工作的关键，又满足了个人权位思想，错误地想通过黄琪翔去沟通各同志意见，自以为徐彬如等同志一定会支持我的。所以希望黄琪翔多征询彬如等意见，同时还努力想减少章伯钧的疑忌，尽管心中十分不满章伯钧，但是章伯钧的公开合法的地位权力还不得不屈从的，对于他布置的工作还是听他指使行事。以为我工作积极负责，黄对章的说话，解决秘书长的问题就更有力。这样的想法显然是忽视政治原则斗争，陷入人事圈子了。并且对人民内部矛盾和整风运动的发展情况，完全作了错误的估计。完全没有估计到右派分子向党向社会主义的猖狂进攻，对章伯钧只看作是一个敲诈的流氓政客，对章、罗联盟的一套阴谋活动和他野心勃勃的做法都是没有估计到。因此把章伯钧等右派分子的言论，只看作荒谬的狂言。自己充当了章伯钧反党、反人民、反社会主义的政治阴谋工具，还自以为我一向矢志忠于党的领导，忠诚于社会主义，忠诚于人民民主专政。并且党和人民给我极大的信任，同章伯钧等右派分子有根本不同。竟然没有自觉到正是在右派分子向党、向人民、向社会主义进攻的阴谋活动紧张的时际，我做了破坏党的领导，破坏社会主义的恶劣事情。我在反右派斗争开展以后，还不认识两条道路斗争的严重性，还顾虑章伯钧可能后台过关，初时的斗争就不够坚决，更没有认识自己的错误。我实在痛心到无地自容，痛心自己竟掉下右派阴谋的污泥坑里。我每一想到辜负党、辜负人民的信任，我就要痛哭。但我决心要在反右派的政治斗争中经受考验，在党的领导下，坚决地同右派分子斗争到底，同章伯钧等划清政治上、思想上的界线。决心在社会主义的实际斗争中，紧紧地依靠党的领导和劳动人民的监督、劳动生活的磨炼来彻底改造自己。
    我衷诚地接受群众的揭发和批判来认识自己的错误。但其中有与事实不符的，请允许我要求检查真实情况，给我严厉的教育！
