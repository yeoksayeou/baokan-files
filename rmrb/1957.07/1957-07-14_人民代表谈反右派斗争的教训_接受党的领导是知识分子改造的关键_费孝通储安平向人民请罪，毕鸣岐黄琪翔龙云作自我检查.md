Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: The Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress continued its plenary discussions today, both morning and afternoon. The representatives who spoke continued to focus on denouncing the rightists' absurd remarks and despicable methods against the Party and socialism. At the morning session, Bi Mingqi made a self-criticism of his erroneous statements. At the afternoon session, Fei Xiaotong and Chu Anping made speeches entitled "Kneeling Before the People to Confess Sins" and "Surrendering to the People," respectively. Huang Qixiang confessed and criticized his relationship with Zhang Bojun. Long Yun, in a written statement, examined his absurd remarks against the Party's leadership and socialism.

A total of twenty-seven representatives spoke in the morning.

The famous mathematician Hua Luogeng refuted the rightists' absurd remarks that the Party could not lead science, university education, and intellectuals. He said, "Search your conscience and compare it with the past. Who can deny that the speed of development of science and education after liberation is unprecedented in our country's history! Why is this? Is it only due to the efforts of a small number of scientists and a few professors? If that were the case, then these great achievements should have appeared long before liberation. Our past painful life shows that these achievements cannot be obtained by professors running schools, nor can they be created by a number of scientists without organization or leadership, but were created for us by the Party leading the revolution, shedding hot blood, and sacrificing their lives." Hua Luogeng said that the Party is fully capable of leading science and education, and not only can it lead, but judging from the achievements of the past few years, it has led extremely well.

Sun Qimeng, Vice Chairman of the China Democratic National Construction Association, took Zhang Naiqi as an example to expose and criticize the rightists' consistent anti-Party remarks and despicable methods. He said that Zhang Naiqi's sinister anti-Party method was to do everything possible to distort, slander, and negate the Party's fundamental theories and policies regarding the bourgeoisie, and to peddle his arguments beautifying the bourgeoisie at every opportunity, fundamentally negating the leadership of the working class and the leadership of the Party from the standpoint of the class foundation.

Xian Ying, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, recalled the grand occasion of the "Democratic Home" in Chongqing from 1940 to 1945. He said that the Democratic League had laid a correct path from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution because it had never deviated from the leadership of the Communist Party. However, today, when the socialist revolution has already achieved a basic victory, and when socialist construction is being carried out victoriously year after year, rightists such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, who came from the "Democratic Home," are attempting to oppose the Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism, and vainly attempt to steal the revolutionary fruits of the broad masses of the people, truly destroying the reputation of the "Democratic Home." Xian Ying said that as the host of the "Democratic Home," he felt particularly angry about this.

Cai Chusheng, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, talked about the great development and achievements of the people's film industry in New China. He criticized the rightists' rampant attacks on the people's film industry.

Li Guojun, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Finance and Economics Publishing House, denounced the rightists' rampant attacks on the basic system stipulated in our country's constitution, on the just cause of the hard work of the people of the whole country, and on the friendly unity between socialist countries.

Bi Mingqi, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, made a self-criticism at the meeting. He said that none of his main erroneous remarks were not the same as Zhang Naiqi's reactionary arguments. The reason why he spoke the same language and breathed the same air as Zhang Naiqi was precisely because he and Zhang Naiqi stood on the same position, representing the reactionary thoughts of the backward side of the bourgeoisie in a concentrated way, and thus became a supporter and peddler of Zhang Naiqi's reactionary remarks. He dug out the ideological roots of his mistakes as being due to the fact that the essence of the bourgeoisie's pursuit of profit had not been changed at all, and had developed to the point of vying for fame and power. Bi Mingqi expressed his determination to correct his mistakes and his willingness to thoroughly transform himself under the leadership of the working class.

Yi Ruisheng, a model agricultural laborer from Jiangxi, introduced the improved living conditions of the members of their agricultural cooperative.

Twenty representatives made written statements in the morning. The written statements of Gu Dacun, Deputy Governor of Guangdong Province, Qin Yingji, Deputy Governor of Guangxi Province, Wang Dezhi, Deputy Director of the Capital Construction Department of the Ministry of Coal Industry, Zheng Jiuhong, an industrial labor model, He Shikun, a member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, Gu Zhibiao, Procurator General of the Sichuan People's Procuratorate, Yu Zhenying, a standing committee member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Wang Guosong, Lu Shijia, Zhao Zhongyao, Qian Chongshu, Yan Jingyao, and Gu Gongxu, workers in higher education, science, and technology, and Chen Chengyi, Deputy Governor of Gansu Province, refuted the rightists' slanders against the Party and the people from the great achievements made in various regions in industrial and agricultural production, cultural education, justice, and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries.

Sun Xiaocun, President of Beijing Agricultural University, Zhang Dongmu, Deputy Mayor of Jinan and Manager of the Dongyuansheng Dyeing Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, and Zheng Lizhai, Chairman of the Gansu Federation of Industry and Commerce, exposed the vicious methods used by Zhang Naiqi to oppose the Party and socialism and the harm caused by his reactionary remarks to the industrial and commercial circles.

Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture, Lu Han, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and Ma Sicong, President of the Central Conservatory of Music, spoke about cultural work, education work in Yunnan, and music work, respectively. Shen Yanbing also specifically criticized some absurd arguments that have recently appeared in cultural circles.

The executive chairmen of the morning session were: Guo Moruo, Chen Jiageng, Tan Zheng, Xie Fumin, Lü Hongbin, Dapusheng, Yan Jici, and Huang Changshui.

A total of thirty representatives spoke in the afternoon.

Ji Fang, Guo Zechen, Wang Shenlin, and Yan Xinmin, members of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, first made a joint statement this afternoon. They severely condemned Zhang Bojun's rightist remarks and activities, and made a guarantee to the congress, the Communist Party, and the people of the whole country: in order to uphold socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party, they must fight the rightists to the end! They once again warned Zhang Bojun: he must wake up, turn back as soon as possible, and make a thorough and frank confession to the people of the whole country.

Li Bozhao, Vice President of the Central Academy of Drama, used many specific examples she saw during her inspection of colleges and universities in Chengdu and Chongqing to show that the weakness of ideological and political work is a more common and fundamental problem in schools. She demanded strengthening the党委制 (Party committee system) in schools, strengthening the work of the Marxism-Leninism teaching and research section in schools, and strengthening the study of current events and policies in schools.

Pei Aqian, the governor of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, listed facts to expose the bloody history of the Lisu people of Nujiang under Long Yun's rule.

Ou Baichuan, Deputy Governor of Guizhou Province, spoke about the work in Guizhou Province. He described the development of economic, cultural, and educational undertakings in Guizhou Province in recent years, and also talked about the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries in Guizhou Province.

Liang Sicheng, a professor at Tsinghua University, made a speech entitled "Why I Love Our Party So Much." Liang Sicheng talked about how he once had the frustration that "the Party is good at everything, but it's a pity that it doesn't understand architecture." He single-handedly wanted to launch an anti-Party movement in the field of architecture. His erroneous theories influenced many architects across the country and caused huge waste. When his mistakes were criticized, the Party patiently reasoned with him and did not equate him with Hu Shi, Hu Feng, Liang Shuming, etc., who were being criticized at the time, because his mistake was an academic ideological issue. Liang Sicheng said, "I know the Party's meticulous care for me, and I can only be moved from the depths of my heart." Liang Sicheng also criticized his leniency towards the rightists.

Fei Xiaotong, in his speech entitled "Kneeling Before the People to Confess Sins," exposed some of his anti-Party and anti-socialist activities since the second half of 1955. Fei Xiaotong admitted that he had become a core member of the Zhang-Luo alliance in thought and action, admitted that he had put forward some anti-Party and anti-socialist proposals in the Democratic League, offered advice and suggestions to Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun, actively participated in the discussion and drafting of the Zhang-Luo alliance's anti-socialist program, and used the opportunity of inspection work to carry out liaison and igniting activities to the League organizations in various places. Fei Xiaotong said that his kneeling before the people to confess sins and continuing to expose his crimes was also to testify to the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

After exposing his reactionary remarks and actions, Fei Xiaotong said that he hated his past and must change his position; he hated the Zhang-Luo alliance and he must draw a clear line with them and make a clean break. He expressed his gratitude to the Party for the benevolent and righteous education it had given him. Fei Xiaotong also said that he had only been awake for a short time, his understanding was not deep, and he would give a detailed account and conduct an in-depth review of his crimes and his thoughts.

Huang Qixiang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, examined himself for "being captured by Zhang Bojun in thought and action." He said that the Zhang-Luo alliance, which centered on the Democratic League as its activity center, was supported by him within the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. During the rectification campaign, he participated in the symposium organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and played a role in igniting fires everywhere. After Zhang Bojun's anti-communist and anti-socialist crimes were exposed, he helped Zhang Bojun make a false self-criticism.

Huang Qixiang said that because his own position was unstable, he had no true love for the people, nor did he have true hatred for the enemy, so he wanted to help Zhang Bojun get rid of the situation, thinking that this was helping a "friend." Therefore, it was inappropriate for him to be in charge of the work of the group leading the examination of Zhang Bojun's crimes within the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and he was criticized by the masses, which was completely right.

Huang Qixiang said that he came from a feudal landlord family and had lived in the old society for a long time. He had stains in history and was also infected with many toxins of European and American bourgeois social life. After liberation, he received the education of the Communist Party, but he cherished the old more than he accepted the new, and bourgeois ideology and feudal remnants were deeply hidden in his soul. Therefore, his actions showed that he could not distinguish between enemies and friends, took chances, and was irresponsible to the people's work, until he was willing to be captured.

Huang Qixiang said that he vowed to completely draw a line with Zhang Bojun politically and ideologically, stand on the people's position, and resolutely fight the Zhang Bojun line to the end.

Chu Anping, entitled "Surrendering to the People," made a self-criticism of his reactionary remarks and actions to the congress. He said, "Today, in this solemn venue, and through the congress, I sincerely admit my mistakes to the people of the whole country, plead guilty to the people, and surrender to the people."

Chu Anping said: "The severe criticism of me by the people of the whole country has made me seriously realize that if I do not make up my mind to fundamentally transform my thinking and change my position, I will have no future." He said that he would cut himself open, peel off the skin of the "bourgeois rightist," and draw a clear line with the Zhang-Luo alliance ideologically and politically.

Chu Anping admitted that his speech at the symposium of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee on June 1 and his work in the Guangming Daily had made serious anti-Party and anti-socialist mistakes. He said that the essence of his mistakes was to serve the anti-Party activities of the bourgeois rightists, with the Zhang-Luo alliance as the core.

He said that his "Party's World" speech was absolutely wrong. The saying "Party's World" is completely inconsistent with the facts. He said that he wanted to use the hat of "Party's World" to oppose the leadership of the Party and attempt to split the relationship between the Party and the people. The fallacy of "Party's World" essentially became a cheerleader for the anti-Party conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Long Yun said in his written review that his reactionary remarks "had a bad influence on Sino-Soviet friendship and unity, socialist construction, and the leadership of the Party." He talked about the "roots" of his vague thinking and unstable position: "The guiding ideology is the ideology of the feudal landlord class, mixed with the bourgeois democratic and free ideology."

When criticizing his anti-Soviet fallacies, Long Yun emphasized that his remarks had a bad effect objectively. He said, "No matter what my subjective wishes were—whether they were based on narrow 'patriotism' or on considering the difficult financial situation of the country—this absurd remark, in its objective effect, aroused 'stirring up Sino-Soviet friendship, undermining international unity, and thus undermining our country's socialist construction事业 (cause)'."

Regarding the fallacies he published on the issue of ethnic minorities, he admitted that "they have produced the effect of undermining ethnic unity." He said that he "was very sorry to the people of Yunnan and the ethnic minorities of Yunnan." However, he said that some of the formulations of the questions were "confusing" the meanings of ethnicity and place of origin; some were due to "hearsay."

Long Yun said that the people of Yunnan originally hated him to the bone, but under the persuasion and understanding of the Party, he was given "importance and preferential treatment" politically and received "meticulous care" in life. However, he said, "Because I am in a high position and out of touch with reality, and also because my blood pressure is too high and I am prone to impulsiveness, I think about things and say things as they come to mind," so "I exaggerate and make mistakes again and again." Long Yun said that he is determined to take the socialist road, transform himself, and start anew.

Eighteen other representatives spoke or made written statements at the afternoon session, including: industrialists and businessmen Le Songsheng, Pu Jiexu, and Zhu Jisheng, Wang Huayun, Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Zhang Xiruo, Minister of Education, Lu Zihe, Standing Committee Member of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, artists Liu Kaiqu and Wu Zuoren, Sun Diancai, Deputy Governor of Gansu Province, Qiao Chuanjue, Deputy Mayor of Dalian City, Kui Bi, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, Wu Yifang, Deputy Governor of Jiangsu Province, Bai Xiqing, Deputy Director of the Central Institute of Hygiene, Chu Yinghuang, Chief Engineer of the Electrical Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, Fei Guangtai, Chief Engineer of the Fushun Mining Bureau, Zhang Zifu, an industrial labor model, and Li Guiying, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Huize Lead-Zinc Mine Committee.

The executive chairmen presiding over the afternoon meeting were: Huang Yanpei, Xu Teli, Ma Mingfang, Cai Tingkai, Deng Chumin, Hu Yaobang, Ou Baichuan, Guoji Mugu, Mei Lanfang, and Zhou Wenjiang.

    人民代表谈反右派斗争的教训
    接受党的领导是知识分子改造的关键
    费孝通储安平向人民请罪，毕鸣岐黄琪翔龙云作自我检查
    据新华社13日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天分上午下午继续进行大会讨论。发言的代表们继续集中地斥责了右派分子的反党、反社会主义的荒谬言论和卑劣手法。在上午会议上，毕鸣岐就他的错误言论作了检查。在下午会议上，费孝通、储安平分别以“向人民伏罪”、“向人民投降”为题作了发言；黄琪翔交代和批判了他同章伯钧的关系。龙云在书面发言中检查了他的反对党的领导、反对社会主义的荒谬言论。
    上午发言的代表共二十七人。
    著名数学家华罗庚驳斥了右派分子所谓党不能领导科学、大学教育和知识分子的荒谬言论。他说，扪一扪良心，比一比既往，谁能否认，解放后科学和教育事业的发展速度是我国史无前例的！这是由于什么？难道只是由于极少数科学家和少数教授们的努力吗？果真如此，那么这些伟绩应该在解放前早就出现了。我们以往的痛苦生活说明了这些成就不是教授治校所能获得的，也不是没组织没领导的若干科学家所能创造出来的，而是党领导革命，流热血、抛头颅给我们创造出来的。华罗庚说，党是完全能够领导科学和教育的，不但能领导，照这几年的成绩看来，而且领导得极好。
    中国民主建国会副主任委员孙起孟以章乃器为例，揭露和批判了右派分子一贯反党的言论和卑劣手法。他说，章乃器阴狠的反党办法，就是用尽千方百计去歪曲、污蔑、否定党关于资产阶级的根本理论、政策，无孔不入地贩运他的美化资产阶级的论调，从阶级基础的立脚点上根本否定工人阶级的领导，否定党的领导。
    民盟中央委员鲜英在发言中回忆起了1940年到1945年期间重庆“民主之家”的盛况。他说，民盟由于始终没有离开共产党的领导，才奠定了由民主主义革命走向社会主义革命的正确路线。可是，在社会主义革命已经获得基本胜利的今天，在社会主义建设一年一年地胜利进行的今天，出自“民主之家”的章伯钧、罗隆基等右派分子竟企图反党、反人民、反社会主义，妄想窃取广大人民的革命果实，真是破坏了“民主之家”的门风。鲜英说，他做为“民主之家”的东道主，对此特别感到愤怒。
    文化部电影事业管理局副局长蔡楚生在发言中，谈到了新中国人民的电影事业的巨大发展和成绩。他批驳了右派分子向人民电影事业猖狂进攻的言行。
    财经出版社副总编辑李国钧斥责了右派分子向我国宪法所规定的基本制度、向全国人民艰苦奋斗的正义事业、向社会主义国家之间的友好团结发动的猖狂进攻。
    天津市工商联主任委员毕鸣岐在会上作了检讨。他说，他的主要的错误言论，没有一处不是和章乃器的反动论调相同的。他所以和章乃器同语言、共呼吸，正是由于他同章乃器站在同一个立场上，集中地代表了资产阶级落后一面的反动思想，因而也就成了章乃器反动言论的支持者和贩卖者。他挖掘他错误的思想根源是由于资产阶级唯利是图的本质原封未动，发展到争名夺位。毕鸣岐表示决心改正错误，愿意在工人阶级领导下彻底进行自我改造。
    江西农业劳动模范易瑞生介绍了他们农业社社员生活改善的情况。
    有二十位代表在上午作了书面发言。广东省副省长古大存，广西省副省长覃应机，煤炭工业部基本建设司副司长王德滋，工业劳动模范郑久鸿，农工民主党中央执行局委员何世琨，四川人民检察院检察长谷志标，民革中央常务委员于振瀛，高等教育、科学和技术工作者王国松、陆士嘉、赵忠尧、钱崇澍、严景耀、顾功叙，甘肃省副省长陈成义等代表的书面发言，从各地区工农业生产、文化教育、司法、肃反等方面取得的巨大成绩，回击了右派分子对党、对人民的污蔑。
    北京农业大学校长孙晓村，济南市副市长、公私合营东元盛染厂经理张东木，甘肃省工商联主任委员郑立斋，揭发了章乃器反党、反社会主义使用的恶毒手法以及他的反动言行对工商界所造成的危害。
    文化部部长沈雁冰、体育运动委员会副主任卢汉、中央音乐学院院长马思聪，分别讲了文化工作、云南的教育工作，和音乐工作。沈雁冰还特别批判了最近文化界出现的一些荒谬的论调。
    上午大会执行主席是：郭沫若、陈嘉庚、谭政、谢扶民、吕鸿宾、达浦生、严济慈、黄长水。
    下午发言的代表共有三十人。
    农工民主党中央执行局委员季方、郭则沉、王深林、严信民今天下午首先作了联合发言。他们严厉地谴责了章伯钧的右派言论和活动，并且向大会、向共产党和全国人民提出保证说：为了坚持社会主义，坚持共产党的领导，他们一定要和右派分子斗争到底！他们再一次警告章伯钧：必须幡然悔悟，及早回头，彻底向全国人民作出坦白的交代。
    中央戏剧学院副院长李伯钊以她在成都和重庆高等院校视察看到的许多具体事例，说明思想政治工作薄弱是学校中较为普遍而带有根本性的毛病。她要求加强学校的党委制，要求加强学校马列主义教研室的工作，要求加强学校时事政策的学习。
    云南省怒江傈僳族自治州州长裴阿欠列举事实揭露龙云统治下怒江傈僳族人民的血泪史。
    贵州省副省长欧百川就贵州省的工作情况发言。他叙述了贵州省几年来经济文教事业的发展情况，并且谈到了贵州省的肃反工作。
    清华大学教授梁思成作了题为“我为什么这样爱我们的党”的发言。梁思成谈到他曾经有过“党什么都好、就是可惜不懂建筑”的烦恼，他一个人单枪匹马地想搞一个在建筑领域中的反党运动。他的错误理论在全国范围内影响了不少的建筑师，造成巨大浪费。当他的错误受到批判的时候，党耐心地同他讲道理，并没有把他同当时正在受到批判的胡适、胡风、梁漱溟等同起来，因为他的错误是一个学术思想问题。梁思成说，我知道党对我的无微不至的爱护，我只有从心眼最深处感动。梁思成还批判了他对右派分子的温情主义。
    费孝通在题为“向人民伏罪”的发言中，揭发了他自己从1955年下半年以来的一些反党反社会主义活动。费孝通承认他在思想上、行动上已经成了章罗联盟中的核心分子，承认他曾经在民盟提出一些反党反社会主义的主张，为罗隆基、章伯钧出谋献策，积极参加章罗联盟的反社会主义纲领的讨论和起草，他曾经利用视察工作的机会，向各地盟组织进行串连点火活动。费孝通说，他向人民伏罪，继续揭露自己的罪行，也就是为揭露章罗联盟的阴谋作见证。
    费孝通在揭露他的反动言行以后说，他痛恨自己的过去，必须转变立场；他痛恨章罗联盟，他一定要和他们划清界线，一刀两断。他表示感激党对他所进行的仁至义尽的教育。费孝通还说，他清醒还不久，认识还不深，对于他的罪行和他的思想还要详细交代，深入检讨。
    中国农工民主党副主席黄琪翔检讨他自己“在思想上和行动上做了章伯钧的俘虏”。他说，以民主同盟为活动中心的章罗联盟，在农工民主党内是得到他的支持的。整风期间，他参加了农工民主党北京市委会所组织的座谈会，到处起点火作用。章伯钧的反共、反社会主义罪行被揭露以后，他又帮助章伯钧做了假检讨。
    黄琪翔说，因为他自己立场不稳，对人民没有真爱，对敌人也没有真恨，就想替章伯钧解脱，以为这样才算得帮助“朋友”。因此，他在农工民主党内担负领导检查章伯钧罪行小组的工作是不相称的，受到了群众的指责，是完全应该的。
    黄琪翔说，他是一个封建地主家庭出身而又长期生活在旧社会的军人，在历史上是有污点的，后来又沾染上不少欧美资产阶级社会生活的毒素。解放后，他受到了共产党的教育，但留恋旧的多于接受新的，资产阶级思想和封建残余思想浓厚地潜藏在他的灵魂深处。因此就在行动上表现为敌我不分、投机取巧、对人民工作不负责，直到甘心作俘虏。
    黄琪翔表示他立誓在政治上和思想上彻底和章伯钧划清界限，站在人民的立场，坚决和章伯钧路线斗争到底。
    储安平以“向人民投降”为题向大会检讨自己的反动言行。他说：“我今天在这个庄严的会场上，并通过大会向全国人民真诚地承认我的错误，向人民请罪，向人民投降。”
    储安平说：“全国人民对我的严厉批判，使我严肃地认识到，假如我不痛下决心，从根本上改造自己的思想，改变自己的立场，我就没有前途。”他表示要向自己开刀，剥去“资产阶级右派分子”的皮，在思想上政治上和章罗联盟划清界限。
    储安平承认他6月1日在中共中央统战部座谈会上的发言以及在光明日报的工作都犯了反党反社会主义的严重错误。他说，他所犯的错误，实质上为以章罗联盟为核心的资产阶级右派分子的反党活动而服务。
    他说，他的“党天下”的发言是绝对错误的。“党天下”之说，和事实完全不符。他说，他想用“党天下”这顶帽子来反对党的领导，企图分裂党和人民的关系。“党天下”的谬论实质上成为替章罗联盟的反党阴谋摇旗呐喊。
    龙云在书面检讨中说，他的反动言论“对中苏友谊团结，社会主义的建设，党的领导都有坏的影响”。他谈到他思想模糊和立场不稳的“根源”，“主导思想是封建地主阶级的思想，又渗杂了资产阶级民主自由的思想”。
    龙云在批判他的反苏谬论时，强调他的言论是在客观上发生了不好的效果，他说，“不论我主观的愿望怎样——是从狭隘的‘爱国主义’出发也好，或是从考虑国家财政困难的情况提出也好，但这种荒谬言论在客观效果上，引起了‘挑拨中苏友谊，破坏国际团结，从而破坏我国社会主义建设事业’”。
    关于他发表的少数民族问题的谬论，他承认“产生了破坏民族团结的作用”，他说他“十分对不起云南人民和云南少数民族”。不过他说有些问题的提法，他是把民族与籍贯的涵义“混同”了；有的是由于“道听途说”。
    龙云说，云南人民原是恨他入骨的，但在党的说服和谅解下，他在政治上得到“重视和优待”，在生活上得到了“无微不至的照顾”。不过，他说，“由于忝居高位，脱离实际，兼之血压过高，容易冲动，想到那里，说到那里”，因此“言过其实，一错再错”。龙云说，他今后决心要走社会主义道路，改造自己，重新做人。
    在下午大会上发言或书面发言的还有十八位代表，他们是：工商业者乐松生、浦洁修、朱继圣，黄河水利委员会主任王化云，教育部部长张奚若，政协四川省委员会常委卢子鹤，美术家刘开渠、吴作人，甘肃省副省长孙殿才，旅大市副市长乔传珏，内蒙古自治区副主席奎璧，中华全国归国华侨联合会主席陈嘉庚，江苏省副省长吴贻芳，中央卫生研究院副院长白希清，第一机械工业部电工局总工程师褚应璜，抚顺矿务局总工程师费广泰，工业劳动模范张子富，中共会泽铅锌矿委员会宣传部副部长李桂英。
    主持下午会议的执行主席是：黄炎培、徐特立、马明方、蔡廷锴、邓初民、胡耀邦、欧百川、果基木古、梅兰芳、周文江。
