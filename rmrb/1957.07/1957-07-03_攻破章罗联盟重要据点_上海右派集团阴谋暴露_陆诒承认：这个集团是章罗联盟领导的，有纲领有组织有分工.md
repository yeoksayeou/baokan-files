Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd. At the meeting held last night by the Shanghai Xinwen Ribao (Shanghai News Daily) to expose and criticize the bourgeois rightist Lu Yi, Lu Yi admitted that the Shanghai rightists Chen Renbing, Peng Wenyin, Wang Zao Shi, Yang Zhaolong, Wang Hengshou, Xia Gaoyang, Sun Dayu, Xu Jie, Han Ming and Lu Yi were a conspiratorial group led by the Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji alliance. This group was anti-people, anti-socialist and opposed to the leadership of the Communist Party. They had a program, a strict organization and a division of labor. Their division of labor was that Chen Renbing, Peng Wenyin, etc. were responsible for the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League and the literary and drama circles, Wang Zao Shi, Yang Zhaolong, etc. attacked judicial work, Lu Yi, etc. took charge of the press, and Sun Dayu, Xu Jie, etc. set fires in universities.

Luo Longji Estimated that a Hungarian Event Might Occur in China and Instigated Shanghai Rightists to Engage in Conspiratorial Activities by Taking Advantage of the Rectification Campaign

Lu Yi admitted that they frequently communicated secretly with the Zhang-Luo alliance in Beijing to conspire. At a secret gathering this spring, Luo Longji instructed them to take advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to further carry out a series of conspiratorial activities. Luo Longji estimated at the time that China was in "a mess" and that a Hungarian event might occur.

Lu Yi said that as early as last summer, this group had planned to attack the leadership of the Communist Party, and that this reached a climax during the recent "great blooming and contending." He said that the Zhang Mengwen incident at the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress meeting last year was the beginning of the rightists' blatant attack on the Party. On the very night of Zhang Mengwen's speech, Wang Zao Shi, Peng Wenyin, Lu Yi, Sun Dayu and Zhao Wenbi conspired together. Sun Dayu complained that Zhang Mengwen had examined himself too early and was too impatient. Sure enough, Sun Dayu later publicly slandered more than sixty people inside and outside the Party as counter-revolutionaries at the CPPCC meeting. This speech had been carefully studied by Wang Zao Shi, Peng Wenyin, Lu Yi, Zhao Wenbi, Zhang Mengwen and others at Sun Dayu's home. They met until late at night. Later, when the Municipal CPPCC held a meeting to set up an investigation team to deal with Sun Dayu's slanderous speech, these rightists defended Sun Dayu in every possible way at the meeting and conspired again at Sun's house that night. Sun Dayu even said arrogantly: "I am not afraid of holding a meeting of thousands of people, I am not afraid of going to court, I am not even afraid of going to the International Court of Justice."

Lu Yi admitted that their "exposing counter-revolutionaries" was a vicious means to attack the Party and Party activists. Lu Yi said that as early as 1954, Peng Wenyin advocated "purging counter-revolutionaries" within the China Democratic League. He opened a list of "counter-revolutionaries," including Fu Yu Chen, Han Xue Zhang, etc. Peng Wenyin's purpose was to warn these people not to lean towards the Party.

This spring, when Wang Zao Shi went to Beijing to attend the National CPPCC meeting, he had several secret talks with Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Gu Zhizhong, Pan Dakui and others. Luo Longji analyzed the international situation and said that the international situation might not ease and that a Hungarian event might occur in China. There was no hope for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and if the United States attacked, they would have to flee to the interior again and suffer the hardships of the eight years of the War of Resistance. Luo also believed that the country was in a "mess" and that strikes were rampant. Therefore, these rightists deployed a series of conspiratorial activities. At this time, Lu Yi also happened to go to Beijing to attend the CCP Central Propaganda Work Conference and offered advice to Wang Zao Shi at the Qianmen Hotel. He said to Wang Zao Shi, you must speak at the National CPPCC meeting, otherwise, this trip will be in vain. Sure enough, Wang Zao Shi peddled American-style democracy in his speech, and the insidious metaphor of "more Tang Taizongs and fewer Wei Zhengs" in the speech was Lu Yi's idea. Wang Zao Shi greatly appreciated Lu Yi's "brilliant plan" at the time and said triumphantly afterwards that the only speeches that could be compared to his at the CPPCC meeting were those of Huang Shaohong, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, especially Huang Shaohong's speech, which was "the most weighty." Huang Shaohong extremely slandered the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movement in this speech.

Conspiring to Organize a Reactionary Political Party at Quanjude Restaurant

Luo Longji Gave Instructions Face to Face and Zhang Naiqi Was Willing to Come Forward

As soon as Lu Yi arrived in Beijing, he visited Gu Zhizhong. Gu Zhizhong was Lu Yi's teacher and also the person who introduced him to Chen Bulei, the Kuomintang secret service chief, before liberation. Lu Yi reported to Gu Zhizhong on the situation in Shanghai and also talked about Sun Dayu. Gu instructed that Sun Dayu should talk about strategy. Gu Zhizhong, Lu Yi, Wang Zao Shi and others also wanted to organize a reactionary political party in the name of restoring the National Salvation Association, and they had discussed this at the Quanjude Restaurant. They vainly attempted to win over young people, students and overseas Chinese to join the organization as their reactionary capital. Luo Longji also instructed Wang Zao Shi face to face, saying that organization was a secondary issue, that the Communist Party did not like them to engage in organization, and that the key was to find ways to win over the masses. Luo also repeatedly instructed them to be careful, and Zhang Naiqi also expressed his willingness to take a position in this future reactionary organization.

After Lu Yi and Wang Zao Shi returned to Shanghai, they discussed major plans with Sun Dayu and others. Sun Dayu even felt that the name of the National Salvation Association was not good and advocated simply forming another political party. Lu Yi said that this was of course a bourgeois political party.

After Lu Yi returned from Beijing, Chen Renbing wanted him to deploy anti-Party activities within the League in the name of conveying the Central Propaganda Conference. Chen Renbing had already determined that the Shanghai Film Studio and other literary units should be the ignition points, so he wanted Lu Yi to talk more about the reaction in Beijing to the article "The Gongs and Drums of Film" in order to incite dissatisfaction among the film industry towards the Party's leadership. Wang Zao Shi also wanted Lu Yi to report on the preparations for the Shanghai Propaganda Conference on a regular basis and was particularly concerned about when the Shanghai universities would start blooming and contending in order to start fires. Lu Yi himself also sowed the seeds of fire within the Xinwen Ribao (News Daily) office.

After the Shanghai Propaganda Conference, Rightists Conspired Day and Night to Counteract the Measures

Seizing Newspapers, Setting Fires Everywhere, Attempting to Overthrow the Party

After the opening of the Shanghai Propaganda Conference, these bourgeois rightists were active day and night, both inside and outside the meeting, and maintained close contact. They went to Sun Dayu's home for gatherings several times. The various anti-socialist and anti-Party fallacies they made at the meeting had been collectively studied and discussed. During the conference, Lu Yi also used his position to tell Wang Zao Shi and others that some factories were causing trouble and some schools were on strike. Wang Zao Shi shouted at the propaganda conference, "Put the focus of blooming and contending on the grassroots." Chen Renbing saw a one-sided phenomenon at the propaganda conference and thought, "The situation is stronger than people," so he threw out the trump card of "settling old scores." After Lu Yi reported the situation of blooming and contending in the Xinwen Ribao to Chen Renbing, Chen Renbing said that since Shen Gong (Shen Zhiyuan) was supporting you, you should go ahead and do it boldly. They blatantly attempted to disrupt the Party's rectification steps.

Attempting to Seize Newspaper Leadership to Serve the Rightists

Lu Yi said that these bourgeois rightists attached great importance to seizing the leadership of newspapers to make newspapers serve the reactionary conspiracies of the rightists. To achieve this goal, they extremely slandered socialist newspapers. Lu Yi believed that the newspapers were "full of dogmatism." Peng Wenyin also said: "There is too little news in the newspapers, turning the people into blind and deaf people." He said that the content of American newspapers was rich. He attempted to change the direction of the people's newspapers by this. Lu Yi said that Chen Renbing paid great attention to Wenhui Bao. When he went to Shanghai Film Studio to set fires, he cooperated with Wenhui Bao. Chen Renbing once told Lu Yi that Xinwen Ribao should learn from Wenhui Bao. In order to seize the leadership of the newspaper, Xu Zhucheng of Wenhui Bao introduced Lu Yi to the "demolition of the wall experience" of driving away party members. Xu said: "The demolition of the wall experience that I want to introduce is very enlightening to your Xinwen Ribao." Lu Yi reported back to the newspaper office to publicize Xu Zhucheng's experience everywhere. Wang Zao Shi even encouraged Lu Yi to take control of Xinwen Ribao. He said to Lu Yi that you cannot be inferior to Jin Zhonghua (President of Xinwen Ribao), we are all upset about this, and Gu Zhizhong is also very upset. He also wanted Lu Yi to be on the night shift so that he could decide on the acceptance or rejection of manuscripts. As a result, Lu Yi actively attacked Jin Zhonghua and Communist Party members within the newspaper office in order to "take command" himself.

Before and after the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Conference, they specifically encouraged reactionary and wrong opinions, and attacked correct opinions. Wenhui Bao reporter Lu Wen attacked Mayor Chen Yi, and Chen Renbing said that he had courage. Lu Mang made a speech attacking activists at the Municipal Political Consultative Conference, and Peng Wenyin had a secret talk with Lu Yi: "I have launched a signature campaign to support Lu Mang, and someone will come to you in a few days, you must publish it." Lu Yi said that he did not agree with Han Ming and Lu Mang making a joint speech at the time, because in his opinion, if you want to fight, you should hit the key points, and the speeches of Lu Mang, Han Ming, etc. attacking activists outside the party were not key points.

They often spread rumors that the Party dared not let go or was going to take it back. Chen Renbing even gloated and said that the Communist Party's lifeblood was the workers and peasants, so they were most afraid of saying that the lives of the workers and peasants were not good. Today, the situation below is not good, so it is necessary to take it back, otherwise, wouldn't it be chaotic?

Peng Wenyin Came Up with Three "Brilliant Plans" to Resist Confession

The Rightists' Attempt to Establish an Offensive and Defensive Alliance Ultimately Failed

After Shanghai and the whole country launched a vigorous anti-bourgeois rightist struggle, Peng Wenyin had secret discussions with Lu Yi, Wang Zao Shi and others to discuss countermeasures. Peng Wenyin proposed three ways to resist confession: not to speak; to speak a little; to have a big debate. After the newspaper exposed Lu Yi's anti-socialist and anti-Party leadership activities, Chen Renbing and Wang Zao Shi told Lu Yi to be "firm" and "calm down." Chen Renbing also said that the Communist Party always does things in a gust of wind, and after a gust of wind, I will still be my professor, and you will still be your deputy editor-in-chief. He also said shamelessly: "If you want to be a typical example, then be a typical example." Han Ming, Luo Longji's confidant who slandered democrats with Lu Mang at the CPPCC meeting, also came to visit several times to establish an offensive and defensive alliance with Lu Yi. He told Lu Yi not to take things too seriously. Didn't you see that the Shanghai Film Studio Democratic League branch has not expressed its position? He also said that Peng Wenyin was still smiling these days, what was there to be afraid of? He also wanted to see Lu Yi's draft of his self-criticism and warned Lu Yi to "stand firm and not fall."

After Lu Yi confessed the above situation, many people stood up and spoke, believing that it was good for him to start confessing. They hoped that he would make up his mind and make a thorough confession.

    攻破章罗联盟重要据点
    上海右派集团阴谋暴露
    陆诒承认：这个集团是章罗联盟领导的，有纲领有组织有分工
    新华社上海2日电　昨天晚上，在上海新闻日报举行的揭发、批判资产阶级右派分子陆诒的会议上，陆诒承认了上海的右派分子陈仁炳、彭文应、王造时、杨兆龙、王恒守、夏高阳、孙大雨、许杰、韩鸣和陆诒等是章伯钧、罗隆基联盟领导下的一个有纲领、有严密组织和分工的反人民、反社会主义和反对共产党领导的阴谋集团。他们的分工是陈仁炳、彭文应等抓民盟上海市委和文艺戏剧界，王造时、杨兆龙等进攻司法工作，陆诒等抓新闻界，孙大雨、许杰等则在高等学校放火。
    罗隆基估计国内可能发生匈牙利事件
    指使上海右派利用整风进行阴谋活动
    陆诒承认他们和北京章、罗联盟经常信使来往密谋，在今春一次秘密集会上，罗隆基曾指示他们要利用共产党整风的机会，进一步作一系列的阴谋活动。罗隆基当时估计，中国国内是“一团糟”，也可能发生匈牙利事件。
    陆诒说，早在去年夏季，这个集团已经有计划地向共产党的领导进攻，到最近“大放大鸣”期间达到了高潮。他说，去年上海市人民代表大会会议上发生的张孟闻事件，是右派分子明目张胆向党进攻的开始。就在张孟闻发言的当天晚上，王造时、彭文应、陆诒、孙大雨、赵文璧就在一起密谋。孙大雨并抱怨张孟闻检查得太早，沉不住气。果然，后来孙大雨在政协会议上公开污蔑六十几位党内外人士为反革命分子。而这个发言稿是事先在孙大雨家里经过王造时、彭文应、陆诒、赵文璧、张孟闻等人周密研究过的。他们当时开会直到深夜。后来，市政协开会，准备成立调查组处理孙大雨的污蔑性的发言。会上，这些右派分子又多方为孙大雨辩护，当夜又在孙家密谋对策。孙大雨竟狂妄地说：“就是开几千人的大会，我不怕，打官司，我不怕，就是上国际法庭，我也不怕。”
    陆诒承认，他们“检举反革命”是一个恶毒的手段，就是打击党和党外的积极分子。陆诒说，早在1954年，彭文应即主张在民盟内“肃清反革命”，他开了一张“反革命”名单，其中包括傅于琛、韩学章等。彭文应的目的是警告这些人不得向党靠拢。
    今年春天，王造时去北京列席全国政协会议时，就和罗隆基、章乃器、顾执中、潘大逵等数度密谈。罗隆基分析国际形势说，国际局势未必缓和，中国也可能发生匈牙利事件。和平解放台湾没有希望，万一美国进攻，又得逃到内地，再受抗战八年的苦头。罗并认为国内是一团“糟”，罢工罢课闹得很厉害。因此，这些右派分子就部署了一系列的阴谋活动。这时候，陆诒也正好去北京出席中共中央宣传工作会议，曾在前门饭店向王造时献策。他对王造时说，你必须在全国政协会议上发言，否则，真是“虚此一行”了。果然，王造时在发言中贩卖了美国式的民主，而发言中“唐太宗多，魏征少”的阴险的比喻，就是陆诒出的主意。王造时当时对陆诒的这个“妙计”极为赞赏，事后洋洋得意地说，政协会上能与他的发言媲美的只有黄绍竑、章伯钧和罗隆基，尤以黄绍竑的发言“最有份量”。黄绍竑在这一次发言中极端地污蔑了肃反运动。
    在全聚德饭馆密谋组织反动政党
    罗隆基面授机宜章乃器愿意出马
    陆诒一到北京，就去拜访了顾执中。顾执中是陆诒的老师，也是他解放前投奔国民党特务头子陈布雷的引见人。陆诒向顾执中汇报了上海情况，也谈到孙大雨，顾曾指示说孙大雨要讲策略。顾执中、陆诒和王造时等还想借用恢复救国会的名义来组织一个反动的政党，并曾为此在“全聚德”饭馆会商。他们妄想拉拢青年、学生和海外华侨参加组织，作为他们的反动资本。罗隆基还向王造时面授机宜说，组织是次要问题，共产党就不喜欢我们搞组织，关键在于设法拉拢群众。罗并一再指示他们要小心，章乃器也表示要在这个未来的反动组织中担任职务。
    陆诒、王造时回到上海，就与孙大雨等共商大计，孙大雨还嫌救国会名义不好，主张干脆另组政党。陆诒说，这当然是资产阶级政党。
    陆诒从北京回来后，陈仁炳要他在盟内借传达中央宣传会议为名来部署反党活动。陈仁炳早已确定把上海电影制片厂等文艺单位作为放火点，因此要陆诒多谈“电影的锣鼓”一文在北京的反应，以此来煽动电影界对党的领导的不满。王造时也要陆诒经常汇报上海宣传会议的准备情况，并特别关心上海高等学校何时开始鸣放，以便放火。陆诒自己也在新闻日报社内部撒下了火种。
    上海宣传会议后右派日夜密商对策
    夺取报纸、到处放火、企图把党整垮
    上海宣传会议开幕后，这些资产阶级右派分子日日夜夜，会内会外，活动频繁，联系密切。他们几次去孙大雨家中集会。他们在会上发表的种种反社会主义和反对党的领导的谬论都经过集体研究和讨论。陆诒在会议期间，还利用职务的便利，曾告诉王造时等有的工厂在闹事，有的学校罢课，王造时即在宣传会议上大叫“把鸣放重点放到基层去”。陈仁炳看到宣传会议上有一边倒的现象，认为，“形势比人还强”，就抛出了“算旧账”的王牌。陆诒向陈仁炳汇报新闻日报鸣放情况后，陈仁炳说，沈公（沈志远）既为你们撑腰，你们放手干好了。明目张胆地企图打乱党的整风步骤。
    企图夺取报纸领导使之为右派服务
    陆诒说，这些资产阶级右派分子很重视夺取报纸的领导，使报纸为右派的反动阴谋服务。为了达到这个目的，他们对社会主义的报纸极尽诬蔑。陆诒认为报纸“一片教条主义”。彭文应也说：“报纸新闻太少，把老百姓变成瞎子和聋子了。”他说，美国报纸内容就丰富。他企图以此来改变人民报纸的方向。陆诒说，陈仁炳对文汇报非常注意，他到上影放火，即与文汇报配合进行。陈仁炳曾告诉陆诒，新闻日报应向文汇报看齐。为了夺取报纸的领导权，文汇报徐铸成曾向陆诒介绍将党员赶走的“拆墙经验”，徐说：“我要介绍的拆墙经验，对你们新闻日报很有启发。”陆诒即回报社到处宣传徐铸成的经验。王造时更鼓励陆诒要掌握新闻日报，他对陆诒说，你不能屈居于金仲华（新闻日报社长）之下，我们都为此不平，顾执中也很不平。他并要陆诒值夜班，可以决定稿件的取舍。由此，陆诒就在报社内积极攻击金仲华和共产党员，以便自己来“挂帅”。
    在中共上海市委宣传会议前后，他们专门对反动的错误的意见加以鼓励，而对正确的意见加以打击。文汇报记者吕文攻击陈毅市长，陈仁炳说，有勇气。鲁莽在市政协会议上作了攻击积极分子的发言，彭文应找陆诒密谈：“我已发起支持鲁莽的签名运动，日内有人去找你，你一定要发表”。陆诒说，他当时不赞成韩鸣与鲁莽联合发言，因为在他看来，要打就应打中要害，鲁莽、韩鸣等的发言打击党外积极分子并非要害。
    他们经常散布谣言说党不敢放或要收了。陈仁炳更幸灾乐祸地说，共产党的命根子是工农群众，所以最忌说工农生活不好，今天下面形势已有些不妙，所以收有必要，否则不是要乱了吗？
    彭文应想出三条“妙计”抗拒交代
    右派企图订立攻守同盟终归失败
    上海和全国展开轰轰烈烈的反资产阶级右派斗争后，彭文应曾与陆诒、王造时等密商对策。彭文应提出抗拒交代的三个办法：不讲话；讲一点；大辩论。报上揭露了陆诒的反社会主义和反对党的领导活动后，陈仁炳、王造时要陆诒“坚定”、“沉住气”。陈仁炳还说，共产党作事从来就是一阵风，一阵风过了，我还是当我的教授，你还是当你的副总编辑。他还无耻地说：“做典型，就做做典型。”与鲁莽在政协会上一起污蔑民主人士的罗隆基的亲信韩鸣，还数次登门，要和陆诒订立攻守同盟。他告诉陆诒说，不要把事情看得太严重了，你不看上影民盟支部也没有表示态度吗？又说，彭文应这几天还是笑嘻嘻的，怕什么？他并要看陆诒检讨的稿子，警告陆诒“要站住，不要倒下去了”。
    陆诒交代上述情况后，不少人起立发言，认为他开始交代是好的。希望他痛下决心，作彻底的交代。
