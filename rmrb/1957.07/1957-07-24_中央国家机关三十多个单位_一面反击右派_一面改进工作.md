More Than Thirty Central State Organs:
While Counterattacking the Rightists, Simultaneously Improving Work

    (Our Dispatch) More than thirty units, including the central ministries and the State Planning Commission, are simultaneously counterattacking the Rightists and improving their work, promptly resolving some problems raised by the masses that could be immediately solved. Some problems involving a wide range and not easily resolved at the moment are also being studied and addressed separately.

    Most units have leaders personally taking charge, establishing various groups or committees to study and address the criticisms and suggestions made by the masses. The Ministry of Railways, based on the opinions of its employees, established six groups for policy, personnel and wages, welfare, and system respectively to carry out work.

    Some ministries have revised some inappropriately stipulated regulations. The "Safety Regulations for Coal Mines and Oil Shale Mines" promulgated by the Ministry of Coal Industry in 1955 had been the subject of opinions from many coal mines, who believed some articles were inappropriate. After the start of this rectification campaign, many technicians also raised suggestions for revision. To this end, the Ministry of Coal Industry established a special group headed by the director of the General Office, with the participation of relevant engineering and technical personnel, to review the articles of the regulations one by one and put forward preliminary revisions. The Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry, and the Ministry of Communications, etc., have all carefully studied the opinions of the masses regarding some unreasonable clauses in the previously stipulated confidentiality system, and have formulated new regulations respectively.

    Various units have also adjusted some unreasonable organizational structures. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has set up three offices for supply, sales, and scrap metal recycling in several major cities such as Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, and Shanghai, each with its own set of institutions, warehouses, and equipment. Now, accepting the opinions of the masses, it has been decided to merge these three offices to unify the management of these three businesses. This can save a lot of expenses and manpower. This ministry originally did not set up a unified management agency in Yunnan. Fifteen non-ferrous metal units there often had to ask for instructions from Beijing before problems could be solved. Not only did it take a lot of time to travel back and forth, but sometimes the ministry and bureaus found it difficult to deal with problems because they did not fully understand the situation of these enterprises. In June, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry decided to add a Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau in Yunnan to uniformly manage these fifteen units. The Hydrogeology Section and the Engineering Geology Section of the Exploration Company of the Ministry of Chemical Industry originally had one drilling team each, and were often busy and idle unevenly. Now they have been merged into one drilling team. The Gas Separation Section and the Synthetic Ammonia Section of the Nitrogen Fertilizer Design Institute have also been merged into one section in accordance with the spirit of facilitating work.

    In terms of living welfare, all ministries have made improvements. The Ministry of Chemical Industry established a Muslim canteen to take care of the living habits of Muslims, and also abolished some unreasonable living benefits for senior cadres. All nurseries were changed from full-time to daytime care, admitting one hundred more children. The Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways carried out an adjustment of the office, freeing up fourteen rooms to solve the accommodation problems of more than seventy single employees. Previously, the offices of the director and section chiefs of this bureau were large rooms. Now they have been changed to small rooms, and those who can work together have been merged into one office. The Ministry of Geology re-examined the welfare subsidy work according to the opinions of the masses. Unreasonable subsidies have been stopped and recovered, and new subsidy standards have been formulated. The Party member ranks in some units were too high, and reasonable adjustments were also made. Fifteen Party members in the Ministry of Justice voluntarily applied for demotion; three Party members in the Ministry of Foreign Trade offered to be demoted by one level; and four Party members in the China National Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation proposed to waive their technical allowances.

    Recently, the leadership style of various units has improved, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has been further strengthened. Some cadres in the Finance Department of the Ministry of Chemical Industry used to say that they often could not see the director of the department. Now, the director of this department takes the initiative to talk to some people every day. Some leading cadres of the Broadcasting Administration go to the transmitting station every day to understand the situation and help solve problems at any time. The station directors of various transmitting stations have also changed the situation of not entering the machine room unless there is an accident, and spend a certain amount of time in the machine room every day. Some bureau directors of the State Planning Commission also talk to comrades in the bureau during holidays, or have fun with young people, which is welcomed by everyone.

    Since the start of the rectification movement, right-wing elements have slandered that the shortcomings of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were the main thing, but the facts have given them a powerful counterattack. This time, many central units have specially reviewed the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, made conclusions for some people who had not been concluded, and publicly explained some situations to the masses. According to the review by the Party Committee of State Organs, the conclusions made in the past on those who were investigated were basically correct. However, there were also some individual shortcomings, such as some conclusions having overly lenient or severe wording. The various ministries are prepared to deal appropriately with this part of the problem.

### 中央国家机关三十多个单位  一面反击右派  一面改进工作

    中央国家机关三十多个单位
    一面反击右派  一面改进工作
    本报讯　中央各部和国家计委等三十几个单位，一边反击右派、一边改进工作，及时解决了群众提出的一些马上可以解决的问题；一些牵扯面广，一时不能解决的问题，也正在分别研究处理。
    各单位大都由领导人员亲自动手，成立了各种小组或委员会，来研究处理群众提出的批评和建议。铁道部就根据职工们提的意见，成立了方针政策、人事工资、生活福利、体制等六个小组分别进行工作。
    有些部对于一些规定得不恰当的条例作了修改。煤炭工业部1955年颁发的关于煤矿和油母页岩矿的保安规程，过去有不少煤矿曾经提出意见，认为其中有些条文不恰当。这次整风运动开始以后，也有许多技术人员提出了修改意见。煤炭工业部为此成立了以办公厅主任为首、吸收有关工程技术人员参加的专题小组，对规程的条文逐条进行了审查，并提出了初步的修改意见。轻工业部、电力工业部、交通部等单位，过去规定的保密制度有的条文不很合理，现在都根据群众意见经过周密研究，分别订出了新的条例。
    各单位对一些不合理的组织机构，也进行了调整。冶金工业部在沈阳、天津、武汉、上海等几个大城市，都分别设有供应、销售和废金属回收三个办事处，各有一套机构、仓库和设备。现在接受群众的意见，决定把这三个处合并，统一管理这三项业务。这样可以节省不少开支和人力。这个部原来没有在云南设立统一的管理机构，当地的十五个有色金属单位，有事往往要到北京请示才能解决，不但往返要花很多时间，有时候部、局由于对这些企业的情况不完全了解，处理问题也感困难。6月间，冶金工业部已经决定在云南增设有色金属局，统一管理这十五个单位。化学工业部勘察公司水文地质科和工程地质科原来各有一个钻探队，经常忙闲不均，现在已把它们合并成一个钻探队；氮肥设计院的气体分离科和合成氨科也根据便利工作的精神，合并成了一个科。
    在生活福利方面，各部都作了改进。化工部为了照顾回民的生活习惯，成立了回民食堂；还取消了对高级干部的一些不合理的生活待遇。托儿所全部改全托为日托，多收了一百个孩子。铁道部设计总局把办公室进行了一次调整，腾出了十四间房子，解决了七十多个单身职工的住宿问题。以前，这个局的局长、处长的办公室都是大房间，现在改为小房间，能合并在一块办公的就合并在一块。地质部根据群众的意见，对福利补助工作重新做了检查，不合理的补助已经停止和收回，并且制订了新的补助标准，有些单位的党员级别偏高，也作了合理的调整。司法部有十五个党员，自动申请降级；对外贸易部有三个党员提出愿意降一级；中国对外贸易运输公司有四个党员提出不要技术津贴。
    最近，各个单位的领导作风都有了改进，党群关系进一步密切。化工部财务司有些干部过去曾说：经常见不到司长的面。现在，这个司的司长每天都主动地找一些人谈心。广播事业局有的领导干部每天都到发射台了解情况，随时帮助解决问题。各发射台的台长也改变了过去不出事故不进机房的情况，每天抽出一定时间到机房办公。国家计划委员会有的局长，在假日里也找局里的同志谈心，或者同青年们一起联欢，受到大家的欢迎。
    整风运动开始以来，右派分子污蔑肃反斗争缺点是主要的，但是事实却给了他们一个有力的回击。这次中央很多单位把肃反斗争专门做了复查，给有些没有做结论的人做了结论，有些情况还向群众作了公开交代。根据中共国家机关党委的复查，过去对那些被审查的人所作的结论基本上是正确的。但也有个别缺点，如有些结论在措辞上有畸轻畸重的现象。对于这一部分问题，各部都准备做适当处理。
