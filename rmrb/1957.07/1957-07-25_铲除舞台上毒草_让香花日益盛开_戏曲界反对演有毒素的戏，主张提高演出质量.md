Eradicate Poisonous Weeds from the Stage, Let Fragrant Flowers Bloom Ever More Luxuriantly.
The Opera Circle Opposes Performing Plays with Toxic Elements, Advocating for Improved Performance Quality

(Our Newspaper) Report: Since the opening up of repertoire, a vibrant scene has appeared on opera stages across the country. However, many troupes have also brought some previously banned, terrifying, and obscene plays to the stage unchanged. This situation has long aroused opposition from many people in the opera circle and the general audience.

At a recent symposium on the performance situation of plays convened by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC and the Bureau of Culture, Jiang Miaoxiang said that opening up banned plays is entirely correct, but these plays should be performed selectively in the spirit of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new". Xi Xiaobo said that the plays we perform should also be based on the six criteria proposed by Chairman Mao in his speech at the Supreme State Conference. Today's art should serve socialism, and actors should self-censor plays with toxic elements. Xiao Changhua expressed his firm opposition to the performance of bad plays such as "Killing Son for Retribution". Actors Xue Yanqin, Xin Fengxia, Cao Jinfu, Lian Kuoru, and others present at the meeting unanimously advocated not performing bad plays.

On the 21st of this month, National People's Congress representatives Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Yuan Xuefen, Chang Xiangyu, Chen Shufang, and Lang Xianfen put forward three suggestions to the opera circle, agreeing not to perform bad plays. This has aroused enthusiastic responses from the majority of artists, especially in Shanghai, where bad plays such as "Jiangshi" (Zombie) and "Afei" (Hooligan) have been quite popular recently. The famous actor Yu Zhenfei expressed his firm support for this call in the newspaper, saying that he felt ashamed to see these bad plays being performed. To say that these kinds of plays are "inheriting and carrying forward tradition" is a slander against the excellent traditions of our country's opera cause! What we want to inherit and carry forward is definitely not these ugly, vulgar, and depraved things, but the beautiful, noble, and uplifting true art! Yu Zhenfei asked the opera circle to carefully read the opinions put forward by Mei Lanfang and others, to improve the ideological and artistic quality of opera under the leadership of the Party, and to temper themselves with the spirit of socialist patriotism to influence the audience. He believes that as a people's actor in New China, one should know how important one's responsibility is. The veteran Yue opera artist Tu Xinghua said that although the government has lifted the ban on some plays, the performance of many problematic old plays should be cautious, and plays such as "Killing Son for Retribution" should not be performed. In addition, Shanghai opera actor Gu Yuzhen, Xiju opera actor Yao Cheng, and He Xianmin, head of the Jinfeng Yongju Opera Troupe, all expressed their sincere agreement with the suggestions of Mei Lanfang and others, to eradicate poisonous weeds from the stage and make fragrant flowers bloom ever more luxuriantly.

    铲除舞台上毒草  让香花日益盛开
    戏曲界反对演有毒素的戏，主张提高演出质量
    本报讯　自从剧目开放以来，全国各地戏曲舞台上显出一片活跃景象。但也有不少剧团将原来禁演的一些恐怖、淫猥的剧目，原封不动地搬上了舞台。这种情况早已引起了很多戏曲界人士和广大观众的反对。
    在政协北京市委会和文化局最近召开的有关剧目上演情况座谈会上，姜妙香说，开放禁戏是完全正确的，但对待这些剧目应本着推陈出新的精神有选择地上演。奚啸伯说，我们上演的剧目也应以毛主席在最高国务会议讲演中所提的六条为标准，今天的艺术应该为社会主义服务，演员对有毒素的戏要自禁。萧长华表示坚决反对“杀子报”等坏戏的演出。到会的雪艳琴、新凤霞、曹金福、连阔如等演员一致主张不要演出坏戏。
    本月21日，全国人民代表大会代表梅兰芳、周信芳、程砚秋、袁雪芬、常香玉、陈书舫和郎咸芬又向戏曲界提出三点建议，相约不演坏戏。这在“僵尸”“阿飞”等坏戏最近相当流行的上海首先引起了广大艺人的热烈响应。著名演员俞振飞在报上表示坚决拥护这个号召，他说，看到这些坏剧目演出很感惭愧。说这类戏是“继承和发扬传统”，这是对我们祖国戏曲事业的优秀传统的污蔑！我们所要继承和发扬的绝不是这些丑恶、下流、引人堕落的东西，而是那些优美、高尚、教人向上的真正艺术！俞振飞要求戏曲界都仔细读一读梅兰芳等所提的意见，要在党的领导下，提高戏曲的思想质量和艺术质量，以社会主义爱国主义精神锻炼自己，影响观众。他认为做一个新中国的人民演员，都应当知道自己的责任是何等重大。越剧老艺人屠杏花说，有些戏，政府虽然已取消了禁令，但许多有问题的老戏搬演应该慎重，像“杀子报”等戏是不应搬演的。此外，沪剧演员顾月珍、锡剧演员姚澄、堇风甬剧团团长贺显民等都纷纷表示衷心赞成梅兰芳等的建议，要铲除舞台上的毒草，使香花日益盛开。
