I completely agree with and support Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of other responsible comrades. Especially after studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," I feel even more enlightened.

**The Lives of Peasants Today are Uncomparable to Pre-Liberation**

Some time ago, some right-wing elements launched massive attacks and slanders against our Party and government. They said we don't need the leadership of the Party! It's as if the socialist system is a "three evils"! Agricultural cooperation has no advantages, and the lives of peasants have declined, etc. These anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks have already been opposed and refuted by the people of the whole country. I am a farmer, and I would like to express some opinions on the issue of agricultural cooperatives, and ask all representatives to see whether agricultural cooperatives really have advantages, and whether the lives of peasants have declined or improved. Now let's start with my cooperative. This Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative, like other brother cooperatives, is considered a relatively good cooperative, but there are many cooperatives like mine. My cooperative was established in the autumn of 1951. When it was first established, there were only three households, but now it has developed to 1,996 households, with 9,230 people, and a total of 20 natural villages. It has 22,000 mu of land, bordering the Shu River in the east and Yuhuang Mountain in the west, with plains and mountains. The land is not good, and the lives of peasants were very hard in the past, especially after the serious devastation of the war. Take my Patriotic Village as an example. In the past, each person only averaged 1.6 mu of land. There was little land, and the livestock and farm tools were very poor. It was considered very good to live on bran and vegetable for half a year. Generally, they ate what they harvested. After the harvest, they ate it all. Sometimes they even ate the crops as they ripened. If there was a disaster, they had to go to Guandong to beg for food. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, there were 32 households in my village, and 25 of them went to Guandong. Only seven households did not go. So there is a saying in my place: "The poor venture south, the rich enter Beijing, and those forced by circumstances go to Guandong."

Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, land reform was implemented in 1947, and peasants were allocated land. The masses wanted to cultivate the land well, but if they were not organized, they would still be the same as in the past. There is a Lü Du-shi in my village, with a family of five and no labor force (women and children). Although she had nine mu of land, she could not produce and worried about not being able to cultivate the land every day. After being organized, she didn't have to worry about it, and she didn't have to worry about not being able to cultivate the land. The cooperative also assigned her some light work. Her family earned more than 250 workdays a year. Last year, her family received 2,500 jin of grain and more than 40 yuan. Let's talk about a strong laborer, Lü An-li, with a family of three and four and a half mu of land. Although he was young and strong, he had little land and no place to use his strength. His income was very low, and the couple fought all the time. In 1952, the second year after joining the cooperative, he sold 500 jin of surplus grain. In 1955, he sold 800 jin of surplus grain. Last year, he received more than 2,400 jin of grain and more than 180 yuan in cash. He also raised a donkey and a pig, and built three tile-roofed houses. The family was also harmonious. Building tile-roofed houses is a big deal in my place. Many people had never even seen them in the past, let alone lived in them. Now there are five or six households building tile-roofed houses in my village alone, and even more in my entire cooperative. The masses in my place say that now there are "three mores" and "three lesses": more people wearing printed cloth, more new houses, and more people going to school; fewer beggars, fewer people wearing ragged clothes, and fewer people asking for debts. The cultural level in my place has improved very quickly. There are more than 30 graduates of senior primary school in my cooperative alone, and there are also many graduates of junior middle school. Many households have three or four children in school. Young people in my village aged 21 or 22 are all literate. In the past, we couldn't even find an accountant in my place, but now it is not a problem. This is not to say that there are many junior middle school graduates and senior primary school graduates in my place, nor is it to say that we don't need to improve our culture. No, our cooperative still needs more junior middle school graduates and senior primary school graduates to help promote agricultural science and technology, and it needs even more people with high cultural and scientific skills to help improve agricultural production knowledge. We welcome junior middle school graduates, senior primary school graduates, and people with higher education to go to the countryside and to agricultural cooperatives in large numbers.

The production of my cooperative has greatly improved since it was organized. The biggest agricultural production task in my place is deep plowing to improve the soil. In the past two years, my cooperative has deeply plowed more than 4,000 mu of land. Some of this deeply plowed land can produce twice as much wheat as land that has not been deeply plowed. This year, the deeply plowed land averaged more than 250 jin of wheat, while the land that was not deeply plowed only produced more than 120 jin. If we were not organized, where would we get the labor to plow the land? As for water conservancy, my cooperative dug 350 wells and opened a nine-li-long irrigation canal (drawing water from the Shu River) and built four reservoirs from the time of senior collectivization in 1955 to the spring of 1956. This also could not have been done if we were not organized. In terms of farm tools, my cooperative has added many new-style walking plows and waterwheels. What is particularly exciting is that there is a tractor station in my county. If it were not for agricultural cooperation and unified land use, tractors could not be used. Unified land use has another advantage, which is that we can plant whatever the country needs, what the masses eat, and what is suitable for the land, according to the needs of the country. Who could do this before we were organized? In recent years, we have also renovated and greened barren mountains and terraced fields. Since 1953, my cooperative has planted more than 200,000 trees. Some of the fruit trees that have been planted are already bearing fruit. The barren mountains that have been barren for many years have changed. This also could not have been done without being organized. Weren't these mountains barren for decades or even hundreds of years? Now my cooperative also has 500,000 saplings, ready to continue greening. The Liuqing River, which has been a scourge for many years, has also been renovated this year, repairing 15 li of river embankment and reclaiming more than 40 mu of land eroded by the river. There has also been great development in animal husbandry. In the past, very few of the 20 villages in my cooperative raised pigs. Now pig-raising households account for 85% of the cooperative. The cooperative raises a total of 2,700 pigs, an average of nearly one and a half pigs per household. The cooperative raises 500 sows, which can give birth to more than 10,000 piglets a year. This has laid a good foundation for the development of pig raising. The cooperative has a total of 830 draft animals. In the past, we only raised small donkeys, but now we also raise mules and horses, and we also have cattle.

Let's talk about the sideline production of my cooperative. The sideline businesses operated by my cooperative are diverse. There are now 18 types (blacksmith, carpenter, bow making, cart pressing, papermaking, flour mill, oil mill, lime kiln, brick kiln, etc.). These sideline businesses not only supply our cooperative and facilitate the members, but also help other cooperatives. Last year, our sideline production brought in a total of 90,000 yuan, an average of more than 200 yuan per day. Could this be done without being organized? Finally, let's talk about our grain income. Because we deeply plow the land, apply more fertilizer, water the land, plant trees to conserve soil and water, raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer, etc., the grain yield of my cooperative has increased year by year. Before the establishment of the cooperative in my village, the average yield per mu in 1948 was 185 jin (this was still with mutual aid teams). Since the establishment of the cooperative in 1951, although my cooperative started with three households and many new households joined every year, our yield has still increased by more than double that of 1948. Last year, the total yield was an average of 408.5 jin per mu. Of course, we think the increase in production is still not fast enough. In 1956, the total income of my cooperative was: 6.18 million jin of grain, 1.44 million jin turned over to the state (public and surplus grain), 380,000 jin of seeds and feed, and the remaining 4.36 million jin were distributed to the members (my cooperative had a total of 8,400 people in 1956), an average of 500 jin of net ration per person. This is incomparable to pre-liberation, and compared with the ration during the mutual aid team period, it is 160 jin more per person. Looking at the average number of jin of grain per person, the rate of increase is not very fast. This is because the population of my cooperative has increased very rapidly. In 1956, the cooperative had 350 births, and the number of deaths, including old and young, was 34, which means that the number of people increased by 316 after offsetting births and deaths. If it were not for the cooperative, it would be difficult to guarantee the rations for these people. In addition to the 500 jin of ration per person, each member also received an average of more than 10 yuan in cash, plus other depreciated prices. Last year, each person's average total income was more than 70 yuan. The personal household sideline businesses of the members were not included. Therefore, some members said: "There are very few people who have little to eat and wear now, and the days of being exploited and oppressed will never come again. After joining the cooperative, we are more worry-free and less laborious, and our income is higher. We can live a few more years than if we worked on our own." After studying Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at this meeting, I realized more clearly the contradictions within the cooperative and deeply understood that Chairman Mao's words that the cooperative will definitely be consolidated after three to five years are completely correct. At the same time, I also deeply realized that Chairman Mao's words that the cooperative must be built up through hard struggle are completely correct. My cooperative has gone from nothing to something, from small to large, through a period of hard struggle, before reaching where it is today.

**Our Cooperative Has Shortcomings But They Can Be Overcome**

Our Patriotic Cooperative has made great achievements in recent years, but this does not mean that we are all good and have no shortcomings. We still have some shortcomings. These shortcomings are caused on the one hand by the cooperative and the cooperative cadres themselves, and on the other hand by the county, district, and township cadres. Our shortcomings are first of all that after the senior collectivization of the cooperative, the cooperative cadres were overwhelmed by the victory and did not take a look at how much money they had in their pockets. They blindly engaged in basic construction and demanded too much and too large. However, they did not put enough effort into production that would yield great returns in the same year, such as deep plowing and careful cultivation, processing and fertilization, etc. They did not adequately educate the members on the "accumulation of wealth from small things" and thriftiness. After the members received the grain, they did not save a portion of the grain for the coming year as they had done in the past. Instead, they believed that the land had been handed over to the cooperative and that they were completely dependent on the cooperative. Some members said: "Eat quickly, winnow quickly, if there's nothing to eat, go to the big field, if there's nothing to spend, go to the bank, if you're sick, go to the pharmacy." The members also had higher demands for housing. The thatched houses that they had lived in for decades had to be repaired in the first year of joining the cooperative. For example, there was a Ma Lianyu whose house was built only the year before last. It was just a little short and small. This spring, seeing everyone building houses, he also wanted to build one, and even wanted to build a tile-roofed house. However, he only built a thatched house this spring and ran up a debt, which affected his life. In terms of eating and dressing, we used to live on bran and vegetables for half a year in my place, which was considered a good life. Now no one eats bran anymore, and no one wants to eat coarse food or wear old clothes. Some members said that in the past, they saved money to buy two more mu of land and leave it to their children to live a good life. Now that the land has been handed over to the cooperative, what's the point of saving it if we don't eat or wear it? Eat it all up and then ask the cooperative for it. Therefore, the cooperative was once short of grain and money. In short, our political education for the members and our education on running the cooperative thriftily were not adequate. We did not educate the members on the spirit of thrift that the elderly used to talk about: "Eat according to the year, dress according to the year, a family starts with thrift and diligence, and eat and dress according to the family's wealth." Therefore, some members are not struggling and have the idea that everything is covered by the cooperative. Secondly, the spirit of running the cooperative democratically is not good. It is not democratic enough. For example, when formulating production plans, we did not widely solicit the opinions of the elderly, young people, and women members. Instead, a few people formulated the plan and passed it at the members' meeting. In this way, the members did not have a deep understanding of the production plan. When formulating the plan, they often emphasized their own opinions and thought that their opinions were stronger than others. Especially in the plan, there was not enough consideration for issues such as the New Year, festivals, weddings, funerals, and marriages. Therefore, some members have opinions. Third, there are shortcomings in the technical management of livestock raising. Emphasis was placed on centralized feeding of livestock, and pigs were also fed centrally. In this way, the cooperative built many pigsties and cowsheds, which cost a lot of money and wasted fodder. Livestock and pigs were also prone to death, and the cooperative suffered great losses. The promotion of improved varieties and technical improvements was not adapted to local conditions and gradually promoted based on the existing experience of the masses. For example, when planting Golden Queen corn, even on fertile land, there were only 1,800 plants, and at most no more than 2,300 plants. However, with the promotion of dense planting, some people planted 3,000 plants, and there was not enough fertilizer. As a result, only some corn stalks grew, and no corn cobs grew.

However, we believe that the above shortcomings are contradictions among the people and must be resolved in accordance with the method of handling contradictions among the people. We have been solving these problems since last year, and we have already solved some of them. Recently, our Party branch and the cooperative committee held a meeting and discussed them. Everyone agreed that these shortcomings must be further overcome. As long as we humbly listen to the opinions of the vast number of members and resolutely implement the policy of running the cooperative thriftily and democratically, these shortcomings can be quickly overcome.

**We Estimate That By 1962, We Will Reach the Living Standards of Well-to-do Middle Peasants**

Now let's talk about our future plans: In terms of grain production, we aim to reach a total output of 8.26 million jin in 1957, with an average yield of 450 jin per mu. Each person can receive an average ration of 650 to 700 jin. Including sideline income, each person's average income will reach more than 80 yuan. If we complete the above tasks, we will have overfulfilled our first five-year plan. Our plan for the second five-year plan is: By 1962, we will strive to reach a total grain income of 12 million jin (excluding economic crops), with an average yield increase of about 600 jin per mu. The measures to be taken: We will organize and deeply plow all 22,000 mu of land in my cooperative. We will increase fertilizer from an average of 6 carts per mu in 1956 to 13 carts. We will expand the irrigated area by 6,600 mu. We will cultivate and improve better varieties. We will develop animal husbandry. First, we will help the members raise their own pigs. The cooperative will only raise sows to cultivate good breeds for the members. Each household will raise an average of about five pigs, and the whole cooperative will raise about 10,000 pigs. We will accumulate a total of 300,000 carts of manure. Each pig, including manure, will also earn a net profit of 20 yuan, for a total net profit of 200,000 yuan. We will also expand the planting area of feed. We will strengthen epidemic prevention, train veterinary personnel, raise more breeding livestock, and continue to strengthen the work of the artificial insemination station. In terms of draft animals, we will gradually replace small donkeys with mules, horses, and cattle. Mountains and forests: In the second five-year plan, we will plant 700,000 trees (fruit trees, mulberry trees, timber forests, etc.). The saplings have already been cultivated, and we will carry out pruning, tending, and pest control. These 700,000 trees are expected to bring in at least 15 cents per tree by 1962, for a total income of 105,000 yuan. We will further improve the quality of sideline businesses, fix costs, and strengthen management. We expect that the actual income can be increased to 150,000 yuan by 1962.

The above is the situation of our planned production growth. We expect that our population will also have a considerable increase. By that time, if the population increases to 11,000 people, each person can get an average of 850 jin of actual grain, more than 40 yuan in cash, and a total depreciated calculation, each person's average annual net income will reach more than 100 yuan. If we complete these tasks, we can reach the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants. Some of our members said: "Our cooperative is located on the east of the Shu River and on the west of Yuhuang Mountain, with mountains, water, and plains. After the completion of the second five-year plan, there will be green mountains, clear waters, and terraced fields everywhere. The reservoirs in the mountains are like clear springs, and the water flows windingly to the terraced fields. The barren mountains for many years have become orchards, the bad land has become fertile land, and the thatched houses for many years have become tiled eaves. By that time, we will feel the fullness of our lives." Everything I said is done by the Party leading the peasants. If we don't want the leadership of the Party, it means we don't want us peasants.

Some right-wing elements say that "the lives of peasants have not improved," and Mr. Huang Shaohong also said that "trouble in the world lies in the countryside," as if to say that we peasants are going to rebel. Some people also think that the unified purchase and sale of grain has messed things up. Where did you hear these words from? I know that only landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, people who oppose socialism, who oppose the unified purchase and sale of grain, and who oppose cooperation say these words. Other people don't say these words. If you don't believe me, then I will first invite these people to live in my place and see for themselves. I will take care of your food and give you fine grains to eat. The cooperative can also pay for your travel expenses. See if the production and life of the peasants in my place are good, whether they have improved, whether the unified purchase and sale has messed things up, whether cooperation has ruined things, and whether the Party members in the countryside have completely separated from the masses. Are the words you said true? These distorted words really make me angry. I resolutely oppose them.

In addition, I would like to make a suggestion. I ask all comrades whose families live in the countryside: government workers, military officers, teachers, and workers should be very thrifty and remit more money home to help their families live. At the same time, we must educate our families to take the lead in the work of consolidating the cooperative. Some family members have antagonistic emotions towards the cooperative and feel that the cooperative is not good for them. Some family members in the countryside seem to have a bit of privileged thinking, which affects the relationship between the masses and the government. Of course, agricultural cooperatives should also take good care of the production and life of family members. I suggest that in-service comrades can establish communication relations with the cooperative.

专栏：

    驳“天下不太平问题在农村”的谬论
    吕鸿宾的发言
    我听了周总理所作政府工作报告和其他负责同志的报告后，我是完全同意和拥护。特别是经过了对毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的学习，使我心里更加亮堂了。
    现在农民的生活同解放前无法相比
    前些日子有些右派分子对我们党和政府大肆攻击和污蔑。不要党的领导啦！好像社会主义制度就是“三害”啦！合作化没有优越性，农民生活降低啦等等。这些反党反社会主义的言论已经遭到了全国人民的反对和驳斥。俺是一个农民，只是就农业合作社问题发表一点意见，请各位代表看看农业合作社究竟有没有优越性，农民生活降低了，还是提高了。现在就从俺那个社说起。这个爱国农业合作社和其他兄弟社一样，俺这个社算是一个较好的社，可是像俺这样的社是很多的。俺这个社是一九五一年秋天建立起来的，才建立的时候，只有三户，可是到了现在已经发展到一千九百九十六户了，有九千二百三十人，共有二十个自然村，土地有二万二千亩，东靠着沭河，西边是玉皇山，有平原，有山地，土地并不好，过去农民生活很苦，特别是经过了战争的严重摧残。就拿俺那个爱国村来说，过去每人只平均一亩六分地。土地少，牲畜农具很差，能过糠菜半年粮的生活就算很不错的了。一般的都是跟着碌?吃饭，打完了也就吃完了，有时还要熟那棵吃那棵，庄稼熟完了也就吃光了。如果遇到灾荒，就只有下关东要饭吃，民国十七年，俺村共有三十二户，就有二十五户下了关东，只有七户没有去。所以俺那里有句俗话说：“穷闯南，富进京，力逼梁山下关东。”
    自从解放后，在党和政府领导下，从一九四七年实行了土地改革，农民都分得了土地，群众就想着把地种好，可是不组织起来还是要和过去一样。俺村有个吕杜氏，家有五口人，无劳力（妇女小孩子），虽有九亩地，可是她就无法生产，天天愁地种不上，组织起来后她就不用操心了，也不愁地种不上了，社里还分配了一些轻活给她干，她全家一年挣了二百五十多个劳动日，去年她家分了二千五百斤粮，还有四十多块钱。再说一个劳力强的户吕安里，家有三口人，四亩半地，虽然年青力壮，但是土地少，有劲无处使，收入很少，生活困难，两口子就光打仗，一九五二年入社后第二年就卖了余粮五百斤，一九五五年又卖了余粮八百斤，去年他共分了口粮二千四百多斤，还有现款一百八十多块，家里也养上了一头驴，一头猪，还盖了三间瓦房，家庭也和睦了。在俺那里盖瓦房是个大事，有很多人过去连见都没有见过，不用说住了。现在光俺村就有五、六户盖瓦房的，就俺全社说那就更多了。俺那里群众都说现在是“三多”“三少”了；穿花布的多了，新房子多了，念书的多了；要饭的少了，穿破衣服的少了，要账的少了。在文化程度上俺那里提高的很快，高小毕业生光俺社就有三十多个，初中毕业生也不少，有不少户一家就有三、四个念书的，俺村二十一、二岁的青年没有不识字的。过去俺那里找个记账的都找不着，现在是不成问题了。这并不是说，俺那里初中毕业生和高小毕业生就很多了，也不是说俺就不用再提高文化了。不是的，我们那个合作社里还是需要更多的初中毕业生和高小毕业生来帮助推广农业科学技术，也更需要有很高的文化科学人材，来帮助提高农业生产知识。我们大量欢迎初中毕业生、高小毕业生和有更高文化的人到农村去，到农业合作社里去。
    俺社的生产自从组织起来后有很大的提高，在俺那里农业生产上最大的一项工作是深翻土地改良土壤，这二年来俺社就深翻土地四千多亩，这些深翻的土地有的地比没有深翻的土地种小麦能多打一倍。今年深翻的地平均产小麦二百五十多斤，没深翻的只产一百二十多斤。如果不组织起来，那里有这些劳力翻地。再说水利，俺社自一九五五年高级化后到一九五六年春共打了三百五十眼井，开了一条九里长的引河灌溉沟（引沭河的水），修了四个蓄水池。如果不组织起来这点也是办不到的。在农具方面，俺社里增加了很多新式步犁和水车。特别使人兴奋的是，俺县里有了拖拉机站，如果不是农业合作化，土地统一使用，拖拉机也就不能用了。土地统一使用后还有一个好处，就是可以按照国家的需要，需要什么，就种什么，群众吃什么就种什么，什么土地种什么合适就种什么，没组织起来前这点谁能办到。这几年来我们对荒山梯田，也进行了修整和绿化，从一九五三年起俺社就栽树二十多万棵，栽的果树有的已经结果了，多少年来光油油的荒山变了样了，这个不组织起来也是办不到的。过去这些山不是已经荒了几十年几百年了吗？现在俺社还有树苗五十万棵，准备继续绿化。过去多年为害的柳青河今年也进行了修整，修了十五里路长的河沿、填出了四十多亩被河水冲刷的土地。在畜牧业上也有很大发展，过去俺社这二十个村养猪的很少，现在养猪户已经占全社百分之八十五了。全社共养猪二千七百头，每户平均接近一头半猪，全社养母猪五百头，一年能生小猪一万多头，这就为发展养猪事业打下了很好的基础。全社共有耕畜八百三十头，过去俺那里只养小毛驴，现在也养上骡马了，也有了黄牛。
    再说俺社的副业生产，俺社经营的副业是多样的，现在共有十八种（铁匠、木匠、洋弓、压车、造纸、粉房、油房、石灰窑、砖瓦窑等等），这些副业除了供应本社和便利社员外，还要帮助其他社。我们这些副业生产去年一共收入了九万元，每天平均二百多元。这个不组织起来能办到吗？最后再说一说我们的粮食收入，由于我们深翻地多施肥、水浇，封山造林、保持水土，养猪积肥等等，使得俺社粮食产量逐年上增。俺村没有建社前，一九四八年每亩平均产量是一百八十五斤（这还是有了互助组）而从一九五一年建社后，虽然俺社是由三户开始，每年都有很多新户入社，可是我们的产量还是比一九四八年增加了一倍以上。去年总产量是每亩平均产四百零八斤半。当然我们认为增产还是不快的。一九五六年俺社的总收入是：粮食六百一十八万斤，交给国家（公、余粮）一百四十四万斤，种子饲料三十八万斤，余四百三十六万斤分给了社员（一九五六年俺社共有八千四百人），每人平均净分口粮五百斤。这和解放前是无法相比，和互助组时口粮比较是每人多得一百六十斤，从每人平均粮食斤数上看增长的速度并不很快，这是因为俺社人口增加的很快，一九五六年全社就生了三百五十个小孩，连老带小死亡是三十四人，生死相抵还增加了三百一十六人，如果不是合作社，这些人的口粮就很难保证了。社员每人除了分得五百斤口粮外，平均每人还分得现款十元多，再加其他折价，去年每人平均共收入七十块钱以上。社员的个人家庭副业未计算在内。所以有的社员说：现在少吃无穿的人很少了，受剥削受压迫的日子永远也不会再有了。入了社后又省心又省力，收入还多，比起自己单干能多活几年。这次来开会我学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告后，使我更加明白合作社内的矛盾，和深刻体会到毛主席所说的合作社经过三、五年就一定能够巩固下来的话，是完全正确的。同时我也深深体会到毛主席说的合作社一定要在艰苦奋斗中建立起来的话是完全正确的。俺这个社就是从无到有，从小到大，经过了一段艰苦奋斗的过程，才到了今天的。
    我们的合作社也有缺点但是一定能够克服
    我们爱国社在这几年有了很大的成绩，但这并不是说我们就什么都好没有缺点了，我们也还是存在着一些缺点的，这些缺点一方面是合作社和社干本身造成的，另一方面县、区、乡干部也要负责。我们的缺点首先是，合作社高级化以后，社干被胜利冲昏了头脑，没摸摸自己的腰里有多少钱，就盲目搞基本建设，又要求过多过大。而没有拿出足够的力量来投入在当年就有收益大的生产上去。如深耕细作、加工施肥等。对社员“财从细起”的勤俭节约教育不够，社员分到粮食后不是和过去一样省吃俭用积蓄一部分粮食以备来年，而是认为土地已经交给合作社了，就一切依赖合作社。有的社员就这样说：快点吃，快点扬，没的吃，上大场，没的花，上银行，病病洋洋进药房。在住房上社员也要求高了，几十年来住着的草房，一入社头一年就要修理，比方，有一个马连玉，他家的房是前年才栅的，就只是矮点小点，今春看着人人盖房，他也要盖，还想盖瓦房，可是今春只盖草房就拉下了账，影响了生活。在吃饭穿衣上，过去我们那里过的是半年糠菜半年粮的生活是好户，现在没有吃糠的了，都不愿吃粗的穿旧的了，有些社员就说过去省吃俭用是想多置二亩地，留给孩子们过好日子，现在土地入了合作社了，不吃不穿留着干什么，吃净花完再向社里要。所以造成了社里一度粮、钱紧张。总之我们对社员的政治教育和勤俭办社的教育很不够，没有把过去老年人常说的：随年吃饭，随年穿衣，家从俭勤起，吃饭穿衣量家当的这种节约精神教育社员，因而使得有些社员不艰苦，存在着一切均由社里包下来的思想。其次是贯彻民主办社的精神不好，还不够民主，比如说在制定生产计划的时候，没有广泛的征求老年、青年、妇女社员的意见，而是几个人制定出来，在社员大会上通过，这样社员对生产计划了解的就不深刻，在制定计划的时候还往往强调自己的意见，认为自己的意见比别人强。特别是在计划中对过年过节，婚、丧、嫁、娶这些问题上照顾不周。因而有些社员有意见。第三是在牲畜喂养技术管理上有缺点。牲畜强调一律集中喂养，猪也要集中喂养，这样社里就建筑了很多猪圈、牛棚，花钱很多，也浪费了草料，牲畜和猪还容易死亡，社里损失很大。推广优良品种技术改良方面不能因地制宜，根据群众已有经验逐渐推广，如种金皇后玉米，肥沃的土地也不过一千八百棵，最多不能超过二千三百棵，而一推广密植，有的就种到三千棵，肥料又上不足，结果光长了些玉米秸没长玉米棒。
    但是以上这些缺点，我们认为是人民内部问题，必须按照处理人民内部矛盾的方法来解决，从去年我们就已经来解决这些问题，也已经解决了一些，最近我们党支部和社委会曾召开了会议，进行了讨论，大家一致认为这些缺点必须再进一步克服，只要我们虚心听取广大社员的意见，坚决贯彻勤俭办社民主办社的方针，这些缺点就一定能够很快的克服。
    预计到一九六二年，我们就能达到富裕中农的生活水平
    下面再说一说我们今后的打算：在粮食生产上一九五七年总产量要求达到八百二十六万斤。每亩平均产量四百五十斤。每人平均可分得口粮六百五十斤到七百斤，连副业收入计算在内每人平均收入达到八十元以上。完成了以上任务，就超额完成了我们制定的第一个五年计划。对第二个五年计划打算：到一九六二年粮食总收入争取达到一千二百万斤（经济作物不在内），每亩平均产量增产六百斤左右。采取的措施：把俺社全部土地二万二千亩进行整理，全部深翻一遍，增加肥料，从一九五六年每亩平均上六车增加到十三车。扩大水浇地六千六百亩。培育改良更好的品种。发展畜牧业，首先帮助社员自己养猪，社里光养母猪，给社员培育良种，每户平均养五头左右，全社养一万头左右，共积粪三十万车，每头猪连粪在内还获纯利二十元，共可获纯利二十万元。并扩大饲料种植面积。加强防疫，培养兽医人员，多养种畜，继续加强人工授精站的工作。耕畜方面逐渐把小毛驴换成骡、马、黄牛。山林：在第二个五年计划内种植七十万棵树（果树、桑树、用材林等），树苗已经育成，并进行整枝、抚育、除虫工作。这七十万棵树，预计到一九六二年每棵最少可收入一角五分钱，共可收入十万五千元。副业再提高质量，固定成本，加强管理，预计到一九六二年实收入可增加到十五万元。
    以上是我们计划生产增长的情况，我们的人口预计也要有相当数量的增加。到那时如果增加到一万一千人的话，每人平均可得实有粮八百五十斤，现款四十多元，一共折价计算，每人每年纯收入平均将达百元以上。完成了这些任务，我们就可以达到富裕中农的生活，我们的社员有的就这样说：“我们的社，东靠沭河，西靠玉皇山，有山有水有平原。第二个五年计划完成后，山青水秀遍地是畦田。山上的水池似清泉，池水弯弯曲曲流到畦田。多年的荒山变成果园，不好的土地变成良田，多年的草房变瓦檐。到那时才觉到我们生活的美满。”俺说的这一切，都是党领导着农民来办的，如果不要党的领导，就是不要俺这些农民。
    有些右派分子说：“农民生活没有提高”，黄绍竑先生也说“天下不太平问题在农村”，好像是说我们农民要造反，有人还认为粮食统购统销搞糟了。这些话你们是从那里听来的。我知道，只有地主富农、反革命分子、反对社会主义、反对粮食统购统销和反对合作化的人，才说这些话，其他的人是没有说的，如果不相信的话，那么我就先请这些人到俺那里去住着看一看，俺管着你吃，给你细粮吃，合作社里也可以给你出上路费，看看俺那个地方农民生产和生活好不好，有没有提高，统购统销是不是搞糟了，合作化是不是搞坏了，农村的党员是不是完全脱离了群众。你说的那些话是不是事实？这些歪曲事实的话真把俺气火了，俺是坚决反对的。
    另外，我提出一个建议，要求所有家属住在农村的同志：政府工作人员、军官、教职员、工人要很好节约，多往家汇钱，帮助家中生活。同时，要教育家属在巩固合作社的工作中起带头作用。个别的家属和合作社有对立的情绪，感到合作社对他们没有好处。有些家属在农村好像有点特权思想，影响了群众和政府的关系。当然，农业合作社也应当很好地照顾家属生产和生活。我建议在职同志可以与合作社建立通信关系。
