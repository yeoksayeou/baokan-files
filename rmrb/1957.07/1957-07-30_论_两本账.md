The Nanjing Xinhua Daily published an editorial on July 27th titled "On 'Two Sets of Books'," excerpts of which are as follows:

Rightist Deng Haoming (Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee and Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party) once viciously slandered the Party, saying, "The Party has two sets of books, one good and one bad. When they need you, they use the good book to calculate, and when there's a problem, they use the bad book." In fact, where does the Party have two sets of books? The so-called books are nothing more than a historical file for each cadre in the country.

Is it necessary for the state to establish a historical file system for cadres? The answer is absolutely necessary. This is a national personnel system, one of the fundamental systems of the state. There is no country in the world without a personnel system. Establishing historical files for cadres is to comprehensively understand their character and abilities, systematically examine their growth process, clarify their basic situation, so as to correctly assign their work, realistically educate and improve them, ensure the purity of state organs, and organize them to actively and faithfully serve the cause of socialism. As for what is recorded in the files, generally speaking, it is certainly not just one entry; there are merits and demerits, strengths and weaknesses, good parts and bad parts, all of which are two aspects of one account. Of course, for the vast majority of cadres, the good and bad parts in each account are not absolute or unchangeable. The issue lies in each cadre consciously striving, learning lessons from their own history, doing more good deeds, and increasing the good parts in their account, which relatively reduces the proportion of the bad parts in the account.

Rightists are most afraid of the state's personnel system and most afraid of having an account (cadre file) that records their history and present words and deeds. This is because not only is their history dirty and cannot be exposed to the light of day, but even after the people have given them leniency and appropriate arrangements, they are still unwilling to give up and want to carry out evil activities against the Party, against the Soviet Union, and against the people. Therefore, they are most afraid of people knowing their anti-communist ugly history. Investigating their criminal history is a necessary step to educate the people and defeat the Rightists. This can enable the people to recognize that their anti-Party and anti-people activities are consistent; it can effectively educate the broad masses, raise political awareness and revolutionary vigilance, and accurately identify their key points to counterattack; it can unite the people of the whole country, win over the centrists, and thoroughly defeat the Rightists. As for all well-intentioned criticisms and all good people who occasionally say the wrong thing, we will never invoke this principle. Among these friends, are there not also a very few who have done some things in the past that were sorry to the people? But today they are performing very well, supporting socialism, supporting the Party, and in this anti-Rightist struggle, hasn't no one been implicated, and has no one mentioned their past? The Party has always insisted on being kind to people and does not like to settle old scores, and many people have had practical experience of this.

    论“两本账”
    南京新华日报7月27日发表题为“论‘两本账’”的社论，摘要如下：
    右派分子邓昊明（农工民主党江苏省省委兼南京市主任委员曾经恶毒地诬蔑党，说“党有两本账，一本好账，一本坏账，要你时用好账算，有问题，用坏账算”。其实，党哪里有两本账？所谓账，不外是国家对干部的每人一份历史档案而已。
    国家要不要建立干部的历史档案制度呢？回答是绝对的必要。这是国家的一种人事制度，是国家的根本制度之一。世界上根本没有人事制度的国家是不存在的。建立干部的历史档案，是为了要全面的了解干部的品德才能，系统地考察干部的成长过程，弄清干部的基本情况，以便正确地分配他们的工作，切合实际地教育提高他们，保证国家机关的纯洁，组织他们积极地、忠实地为社会主义事业服务。至于账内所记，一般说来，确非一笔，有功也有过，有优点也有缺点，有好的部分也有坏的部分，那都是一本账的两笔。当然，对于广大干部来说，每一本账里的好坏部分，并不是绝对的，不可变化的。问题是在于每个干部必须自觉的努力，从自己的历史中吸取教训，多做好事，增加账中好的部分，这就相对地缩小了账中坏的部分的比例。
    右派分子最怕国家的人事制度，最怕有一本账（干部档案），记录他们的历史和现在的言行，这是因为他们不但历史上肮脏污浊见不得天日，而且他们在人民给以宽大处理和适当安排之后，还是其心不死，要进行反共反苏反人民的罪恶勾当，所以他们最怕人家知道他们的反共丑史。追查他们的罪恶历史，是教育人民、战胜右派的必要步骤。这可以使人民认清他们反共反人民的活动是一贯的；可以有效地教育广大群众，提高政治觉悟和革命警惕性，看准他们的要害去反击；可以团结全国人民，争取中派，彻底打垮右派。至于对于一切善意的批评，对于一切偶尔说错了话的好人，我们就决不援用这个原则。在这些朋友中，不是也有极少数的人过去也曾经做过一些对不起人民的事情吗？但是今天他们表现很好，拥护社会主义，拥护党，在这次反右派斗争中不是谁也没有牵涉到他们，更没有人提及他们的往事吗？党始终是坚持与人为善的，是不喜欢算人家的老账的，这一点，许多人都是有实际体会的。
