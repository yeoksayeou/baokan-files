Rightists are Like Trying to Recover Salt from Water, and a Blind Man Crossing a Bridge
Yi Ruisheng says: We also agree to "settle old scores." We want to make our sons and grandsons know the suffering their fathers endured in the past, so they won't say foolish things.
I fully support Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and Premier Zhou's Government Work Report. I completely agree with the reports of comrades Li Xiannian, Bo Yibo, and others, and will resolutely implement them in my future work.

I am the director of the First Agricultural Cooperative of Nianfeng Township, Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province. I didn't go to school and couldn't speak well in the past. Now, seeing the rightists say, "Agricultural collectivization has no advantages, and the lives of farmers are very hard and have not improved," I am very angry. If ignorant children say this, we can't blame them because they are young and ignorant. But you rightists, you guys who have studied for so many years, gone to college, and some even studied abroad, don't you understand or know how miserable the farmers were in the old society? Have you really not seen the improvement in farmers' lives after liberation? This is really a strange thing. Take our cooperative as an example. The entire cooperative has 283 households with 1,293 people. Before liberation, they could not eat enough or wear warm clothes and lived like animals. Most of the land we farmers cultivated belonged to landlords and rich peasants. For every dan (approximately 50 kg) of grain harvested, we had to pay six dou (approximately 30 kg) in rent, plus the grain and taxes demanded by the reactionary government and all kinds of extortion. As a result, after working for a year, we didn't have much grain left and had to eat wild vegetables and borrow from others to survive. It was common to go without oil or salt for days and without fish or meat during the New Year. Forty to fifty percent of farmers couldn't wear tattered cotton-padded clothes or cover themselves with broken cotton quilts in winter. The houses most farmers lived in were drafty on all sides, and when it rained, it rained heavily outside and drizzled inside; when it didn't rain outside, it still dripped inside. The Kuomintang reactionary government didn't care about the life or death of the people and also conscripted laborers and soldiers and cruelly oppressed us. We farmers had to flee from famine. I remember when we fought against the Japanese devils during the War of Resistance, none of the 104 households in my village had anything to eat. Life forced us to flee to other places, causing families to be separated and destroyed. During the 70 days of our escape, 76 people died of starvation, illness, and freezing. How tragic! Rightists, aren't you advocating settling old scores? Then fine, let's settle three accounts of Jiangxi now:

The first account: According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 340,000 Red Army family households in the province (some households had two or three people joining the army), and more than 100,000 people participated in the 25,000-li Long March. Less than 1,000 of them are still working in the People's Liberation Army and local areas.

The second account: In 1934, after the Red Army went north to resist the Japanese and the Kuomintang occupied the Soviet area, more than one million people in the Soviet area were killed.

The third account: Before the Great Revolution, Jiangxi had a population of 26 million. Due to the Kuomintang's long-term rule and large-scale massacres and devastation, only 13 million people were left when it was liberated in 1949. The province's population had decreased by nearly half, and now it has only recovered to 18.2 million. Rightists, have you forgotten these past accounts? If you have forgotten, the people of Jiangxi can't forget. If you rightists really want to settle accounts, now, not to mention letting you repay the principal, you will never be able to repay even a bit of the interest. We want to pour out our grievances, to make our sons and grandsons know how their fathers were exploited and oppressed by landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists, and how the people in the old revolutionary base areas were massacred and devastated by the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Rightists spread rumors saying that the lives of farmers are very hard and that cooperatives have no advantages. This is really telling lies with their eyes open. If you understand our cooperative, you will know whether the lives of farmers have improved! After liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government, we farmers were liberated and became masters of our own destiny. In 1950, we organized a mutual aid team of 11 households. In 1953, it was transformed into a primary cooperative with 34 households. In 1954, it expanded to 104 households. In the winter of 1955, it was transformed into an advanced cooperative with 283 households. Because collectivization has great advantages, production has greatly developed. The cultivated land area and rice yield increased from 470 jin per mu (approximately 705 kg per hectare) in 1949 to nearly 1,000 jin per mu (approximately 1500 kg per hectare) in 1956. Sideline production has also greatly increased. Now, each household raises three pigs and has more than 30 chickens and ducks. In 1956, our average annual net income per person reached more than 90 yuan, an increase of nearly one and a half times compared to before liberation. Except for a few households that have some difficulties in their lives, the rest have reached the level of middle peasants, and more than 70% of the members have reached the living standards of well-to-do middle peasants. In the past, before the establishment of the cooperative, our cooperative lacked an average of three to four months of food per household per year. In 1956, in addition to fully guaranteeing the members' food, seeds, and fodder, we also sold more than 330,000 jin of surplus grain. Now, everyone not only eats their fill and wears warm clothes, but their lives are also improving year by year. Last year, our cooperative slaughtered more than 90 New Year pigs. In the past, we wore tattered clothes, but now we have both single-layered and cotton-padded clothes, and we have all replaced them with new clothes. The quilts have also been replaced with new covers and new cotton. In the past, we couldn't afford rubber shoes, but now more than 90% of farmers wear them.

We have also been liberated culturally. Of the 1,293 people in the entire cooperative, only more than 30 people had attended primary school in the past, and six had attended junior high school. Now, 90% of the people are literate and can read newspapers, and illiteracy has been basically eliminated. Now, there are more than 130 children in our cooperative attending primary school, 25 attending junior high school, and 15 attending middle school. There are seven in high school and university.

Since liberation, our lives have not only improved, but environmental sanitation has also greatly improved, and the population has increased. Since liberation, more than 200 children have been added to the 283 households. In the past eight years, only 15 people have died due to old age or illness. The masses say, "The Communist Party is our great savior," and "Agricultural collectivization has brought us happiness." This fully demonstrates that due to the advantages of collectivization, production has increased, and the people's material and cultural lives have been significantly improved and raised.

Rightists, you may not want to hear about the improvement of people's lives, but we will say it; not only will we say it, but we will also compose folk songs to sing it. If you don't want to listen, we will sing it anyway.

Rightists, I am now warning you, if you do not accept transformation, oppose socialism, and want to take the capitalist road, then you are like trying to recover salt from water, wasting your efforts, and like a blind man crossing a bridge, heading for a dead end. Don't you even dream of making us farmers live like animals again, we won't. We have the Communist Party, the People's Government, and agricultural cooperatives. We have taken root, and our roots are very firm. You cannot defeat us. We have 600 million people closely united around the Communist Party. We will always follow the Communist Party. We know that the victory of the revolution was achieved under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, through long-term hard struggle and the bloodshed and sacrifice of many revolutionary martyrs. We must resolutely defend the fruits of the revolutionary victory, resolutely take the socialist road, and not fear any storms, or you demons and ghosts stirring up trouble. If you are determined to oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose the people, we will resolutely overthrow you.

    右派分子是水里捞盐瞎子过桥
    易瑞生说：我们也同意“算旧账”，我们要使我们的儿子和孙子知道老子过去受的苦，不要说蠢话。
    我完全拥护毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告和周总理的政府工作报告。完全同意李先念、薄一波等同志的报告，并在今后实际工作中，坚决贯彻执行。
    我是江西省萍乡县年丰乡第一农业社主任。我过去没有读过书、不会讲话，现在看到右派分子说：“农业合作化没有优越性，农民生活很苦，没有得到改善”，我很气愤。如果不懂事的孩子这样说，我们不能怪他，因为他们小，年幼无知，可是右派分子们，你们这些家伙，念过多少年书，读过大学，有的留过洋，难道还不懂事、不知道旧社会的农民怎样困苦吗？真的没有看到解放后农民生活的改善吗？这真是一件怪事。就拿我们社来说，全社二百八十三户，一千二百九十三人，在解放前吃不饱、穿不暖，过着牛马的生活。我们农民种的土地，绝大部分都是地主富农的，收一担谷，要交六斗租，再加上反动政府要粮、要税和各种敲诈勒索。这样，我们劳动一年，就没有剩下多少粮食，不得不再吃些野菜和东讨西借来活命。几天吃不上油、盐，过年吃不上鱼和肉，这是很平常的事情；有百分之四十到百分之五十的农民到冬天穿不上烂棉袄，盖不上破棉被；绝大多数农民住的房子是四面都透风，在下雨天，外边大下，屋里小下，外边不下，屋里还下。国民党反动政府不管人民的死活，还要拉夫捉丁和残酷压迫，我们农民不得不逃荒逃命，曾记得，在抗战打日本鬼子那年，我家那个村一百零四户都没得吃，生活逼着我们逃荒外地，弄得妻离子散，家破人亡。在七十天的逃难中，饿死、病死和冻死了七十六个人，这有多凄惨啊！右派分子们，你们不是主张算旧账吗？那么好罢，现在就算一算我们江西的三笔账：
    第一笔账，据不完全统计，全省有三十四万多户红军家属（其中有些户参军的有二至三人），有十多万人参加了二万五千里长征，现在还在解放军和地方工作的不到一千人。
    第二笔账，一九三四年红军北上抗日，国民党占领苏区以后，苏区人民被杀害的上百万人。
    第三笔账，大革命前，江西有二千六百万人口。由于国民党的长期统治和大批屠杀与摧残，到1949年解放的时候，只剩下一千三百多万人。全省人口将近减少一半，现在才恢复到一千八百二十万。右派分子们，过去的这些账，难道你们都忘了吗？你们忘了，我们江西人民可忘不了。如果你们这些右派分子，真正要算账，现在不要说让你们还本，就是还点利息你们也永远还不起。我们要诉苦，要使我们的儿子和孙子知道他们的老子过去是如何受地主、富农、资本家剥削压迫，如何受国民党反动派对老根据地人民大批屠杀和摧残。
    右派分子造谣说，农民生活很苦，合作社没有优越性，真是睁着眼睛说瞎话，如果你们了解一下我们的社，就会知道农民的生活改善了没有！解放以后，我们农民在毛主席、共产党和人民政府领导下，翻了身，做了主人。我们于一九五○年组织了一个十一户的互助组，一九五三年转为初级社，三十四户，一九五四年扩大到一百零四户，一九五五年冬转为高级社，扩大到二百八十三户。因为合作化有很大优越性，生产大大发展了，耕地面积稻谷产量从一九四九年每亩四百七十斤到一九五六年提高到将近一千斤。副业生产也有很大增加，现在我们每户养到三头猪，有三十多只鸡鸭。我们一九五六年每人全年平均纯收入达到九十多元，比解放前增加将近一倍半。除个别户，在生活上稍有困难外，其余都达到了中农生活水平，其中百分之七十以上的社员，达到了富裕中农的生活水平。过去在未建社前，我社每户平均全年要缺三、四个月口粮，一九五六年除了充分保证社员口粮、种子、饲料以外，还卖了三十三万多斤余粮。现在大家不但吃得饱、穿得暖，而且生活逐年改善。去年我社仅杀年猪共九十多头。过去是破衣烂袄，现在是有单有棉，都换上了新衣服，被子也换上了新面子和新棉絮；过去穿不上胶鞋，现在有百分之九十以上的农民都穿上了。
    在文化上我们也翻了身。全社一千二百九十三人中，过去只有三十多个人上过小学，六个读过高小，现在百分之九十的人都识字，能够看报纸，基本上扫除了文盲。现在我们社里，有一百三十多个孩子读初小，二十五个读高小，十五个读初中，在高中和大学的有七个。
    解放以后，我们的生活不但得到了改善，环境卫生也随着有很大的改善，人口增加了。从解放到现在二百八十三户中，增添了二百多个孩子。八年来，因年老或疾病死亡的仅十五人。群众说：“共产党是我们的大救星”，“农业合作化给我们带来了幸福”。这就可以充分说明，由于合作化的优越性，增加了生产，人民物质文化生活得到了显著的改善与提高。
    右派分子们，你们可能不愿意听人民生活改善的话，但我们要说；不但要说，我们还编成山歌去唱，你们不愿意听我们偏要唱。
    右派分子们，我现在警告你们，如果你们不接受改造，反对社会主义，要走资本主义道路的话，那就是水里捞盐，枉费心机，瞎子过桥，死路一条。你们别妄想叫我们农民再过牛马的日子吧，我们是不过的。我们有了共产党，有了人民政府，有了农业合作社，我们扎了根，而且根还扎得很牢固，你们是打不倒的。我们有六万万的人民，紧密地团结在共产党的周围，我们永远跟着共产党走，我们知道，革命的胜利，是在共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，经过长期的艰苦奋斗和许多革命先烈的流血牺牲，才获得今天的胜利。我们要坚决保卫革命的胜利的果实，坚决走社会主义道路，不怕任何狂风暴雨，不怕你们这些妖魔鬼怪兴风作浪，如果你们要坚决反党、反社会主义、反人民，我们就坚决打倒你们。
