(Reported by this newspaper) The China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) Central Leadership Comrades' Rectification Forum continued on the morning of the 7th. Lin Handa made a preliminary self-criticism at the meeting, but his self-criticism was not thorough. Many people further exposed Lin Handa's fallacies and double-dealing tactics at the meeting, demanding that he conduct a thorough examination. The forum was presided over by Xu Guangping.

In his self-criticism, Lin Handa admitted that his speech at the United Front Work Department's forum was a serious mistake. He believed that this speech played a role in provoking discord, splitting the people, smearing socialist cultural construction, and undermining and weakening the Party's leadership, and was therefore harmful to the people. Lin Handa said that his speech at the United Front Work Department's forum was spoken with "sincerity," was "singing the same tune" as the rightists, and was standing on the "side of the rightists." However, Lin Handa believed that the root cause of the error was only due to "the petty-bourgeois intellectuals' being ambitious and prone to extremes." He said it was because the Party did not care enough about him politically, leading to dissatisfaction with the Party and having a "sour grapes" mentality. At the same time, he also said that he not only had not abandoned the bourgeois ideology but also missed the Anglo-American way of life, had feelings for bourgeois democracy, and only obeyed but did not love the people's democratic dictatorship system. He expressed that he would transform himself well in the future and draw a clear line with the rightists.

After Lin Handa's self-criticism, Xu Boxin first pointed out that his self-criticism was insufficient. Xu Boxin said that Lin Handa said today that he wanted to draw a clear line with the rightists, but on July 3, at Ma Xulun's house, he also said such things as: "The anti-rightist struggle is a life-and-death struggle. If it is done well, the Hungarian incident can be avoided; if it is not done well, it is hard to say." Xu Boxin said, what is the intention of saying these words? Wang Hongzhen believed that Lin Handa's saying this was political blackmail and showed resistance to the anti-rightist struggle.

Zheng Fanglong, a cadre of the CAPD Central Office, exposed many of Lin Handa's erroneous words and deeds. Zheng Fanglong said that Lin Handa had always disliked hearing about achievements, believing that writing summaries and talking about achievements was stereotypical writing, and always liked to emphasize shortcomings. This time, at the United Front Work Department's forum, he again erased the achievements of the education cause and exaggerated the shortcomings in the work. This shows that his erroneous remarks are consistent. Zheng Fanglong said that Lin Handa also said: "It is really difficult for intellectuals to behave. If you get close to the leadership, others will say you are climbing up; if you interact with subordinates, they will say you are currying favor with the masses; if you run around among cadres of the same level, they will say you are forming cliques. In this way, you can only shut your doors and thank guests, and never interact with each other until you die." Therefore, Lin Handa advocated that the organizational life of the CAPD should allow intellectuals to complain. Zheng Fanglong said, the situation and mood of intellectuals are definitely not like that now, what position is Lin Handa standing on when he says such things?

Feng Binfu severely criticized Lin Handa's self-criticism. Feng Binfu said that since the beginning of the anti-rightist struggle, he had never heard Lin Handa criticize the Zhang-Luo alliance. On the contrary, he pointed his finger at Zhou Jianren, blaming him for not saying that the wall should be torn down on both sides.

At the meeting, some people also raised questions asking Lin Handa to conduct an in-depth examination and confession. Liang Ming exposed that Lin Handa repeatedly advocated developing the organization during the rectification period and advocated that grassroots organizations could hold forums without waiting for the Party's arrangements when helping the Party with rectification.

    林汉达的错误言行是一贯的
    民进整风座谈会继续进行批判和揭发
    本报讯　中国民主促进会中央领导同志整风座谈会在7日上午继续举行。林汉达在会上初步作了检讨，但他检讨得不深刻。很多人在会上进一步揭露林汉达的谬论和两面手法，要求他彻底检查。座谈会由许广平主持。
    林汉达在检讨中，承认他在统战部座谈会的发言是犯了严重的错误。他认为这个发言是起了挑拨离间分裂人民、污蔑社会主义文化建设、破坏和削弱党的领导的作用，因而是危害人民的。林汉达说，他在统战部座谈会的发言是讲了“真心话”，是同右派分子“一鼻孔出气”，是站在“右派的一边”。但是，林汉达认为错误的根源只是由于“小资产阶级知识分子好高骛远，好走极端。”说是因为党对他政治上关心不够，致对党不满，有狐狸吃不到酸葡萄的情绪。同时，他又说自己不但没有抛弃资产阶级的思想意识，而且留恋英美的生活方式，对资产阶级的民主有感情，对于人民民主专政制度只是服从而并不热爱。他表示今后要好好改造自己，与右派分子划清界限。
    林汉达检讨后，徐伯昕首先指出他的检讨很不够。徐伯昕说，林汉达今天表示要与右派划清界限，但他7月3日在马叙伦家里还说过这样的话：“反右派斗争是生死斗争，搞得好，可以避免匈牙利事件，搞得不好，就很难说。”徐伯昕说，说这些话的用意何在？王鸿桢认为林汉达说这种话是政治讹诈，是对反右派斗争有抵触情绪。
    民进中央机关干部郑芳龙揭发了林汉达的许多错误言行。郑芳龙说，林汉达一向不爱听成绩，认为写总结谈成绩是八股，总是喜欢强调缺点，这次他在统战部座谈会上又抹煞了教育事业的成绩，夸大了工作中的缺点。可见他的错误言论是一贯的。郑芳龙说，林汉达还说过：“知识分子做人真难，你靠拢领导，别人说你是往上爬，跟下级交往，说你是拉拢群众，在同级干部之间跑跑，又说你搞小圈子，这样只好闭门谢客，老死不相往来。”因此林汉达主张民进的组织生活应让知识分子发牢骚。郑芳龙说，现在知识分子的处境和心情绝不是那样，林汉达说这种话是站在什么立场。
    冯宾符严厉批评了林汉达的检讨。冯宾符说，从反右派斗争开始，从来没有听见林汉达批判过章罗联盟，反而指着鼻子责问周建人，怪他不应说墙要两面拆。
    会上，还有人提出问题要求林汉达深入检查和交代。梁明揭露林汉达一再主张在整风期间还要发展组织，在帮助党整风时又主张基层组织可以不等待党的布置就开座谈会。
