Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 18th. A type of rice that can overwinter—winter rice—has great potential for promotion under suitable natural conditions. This is the conclusion reached by more than 70 agricultural technicians from Guangxi Province after recently visiting Debao County in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture to observe the planting of winter rice.

Currently, more than 100,000 mu of winter rice in the southwestern part of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, including Tian'e, Daxin, Ningming, and Debao counties, has been harvested. Debao County's more than 23,000 mu of winter rice is estimated to yield an average of 350 jin per mu, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year. The highest yields reach 600-700 jin per mu.

Winter rice is transplanted in November after the autumn harvest each year and harvested before the busy summer harvest season (June), which can regulate labor and animal power. It has fewer pests and diseases, avoids the harm of floods caused by summer mountain torrents, has a more stable yield, and matures more than half a month earlier than early corn and early rice. Planting a crop of winter rice in mid-season or late-season rice fields enables some deep, wet fields and cold water fields in mountainous areas that cannot grow double-cropping rice to grow two crops of rice each year. According to statistics from Debao County last year, the average yield per mu of winter and late-season rice in the county was 50% higher than the yield of early and late-season rice.

The visitors exchanged techniques and management experiences in cultivating winter rice in various places, and made a summary in order to further promote the planting of winter rice this winter.

    越冬的水稻——冬稻
    新华社南宁18日电　一种能越冬的水稻——冬稻，在适宜的自然条件下，有很大的推广价值。这是广西省七十多个农业技术人员最近参观了桂西僮族自治州德保县种植冬稻的情况以后作出的结论。
    目前，桂西僮族自治州西南部的天峨、大新、宁明、德保等县的十多万亩冬稻已收割完毕。德保县二万三千多亩冬稻，估计平均每亩可收三百五十斤，比去年增加两成多。产量最高的每亩达六、七百斤。
    冬稻在每年秋收以后的11月间插秧，第二年夏收大忙以前（6月）收割，能够调节劳动力和畜力。病虫害少，可以避免夏季山洪暴发所造成的水灾危害，产量较稳定，而且比早玉米、早稻成熟期提早半个月以上。在中稻或晚稻田增种一季冬稻，使一些不能种植双季种的山区深湿田和冷水田每年也能种植两季水稻。据德保县去年统计，全县冬、晚两季水稻平均每亩产量比早、晚两季水稻产量高50％。
    参观的人交流了各地栽培冬稻的技术、管理经验，作出了总结，以便今冬进一步推广种植冬稻。
