    Destroy the Rightists' Stronghold at Peking University
    Liu Qun, Zhou Dingfang, Jiang Huai
    The reactionary clique of rightists at Peking University – the organization known by two names, "Hundred Flowers Society" and "Plaza" – has had its schemes exposed after more than a month of struggle against rightists. Those who were deceived are gradually awakening; the masses in the middle have opened their eyes and seen the anti-Party and anti-socialist activities carried out by this small group of rightists. This group has already begun to disintegrate internally, and many rightists have surrendered.

    Political Conspiracy
    From the beginning, this small group engaged in planned and organized activities with clear political goals. Their aim was to use Peking University as a base, and through publications and organizations, establish connections with rightists in universities across the country. They wanted to spread the flames of anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiment to all universities, then extend it to middle schools, disrupting the schools. Then, they would spread the fire to factories and rural areas. In the words of the rightists, they were "uniting the lone armies" of rightists, the so-called "democratic fighters," to "carry out a long-term struggle" and "lead the student movement through publications." They declared they wanted to "seize the right to speak" and run "publications with viewpoints different from the Party Central Committee."

    Before the reactionary publication "Plaza" was even organized, as early as May 29th, rightists Wang Guoxiang, Cui Defu, and others from Peking University, along with rightist Lin Xiling from the Renmin University of China, secretly discussed the organization, nature, purpose, and assessment of the current situation regarding the publication. They defined their task as: "We must be at the forefront, we are the fire-starters, we must lead the movement well, we must enlighten the masses."

    Garbage Dump of the New Society
    Just as the school Party committee was conducting rectification in a planned and step-by-step manner, the reactionary clique "Plaza" openly emerged. At this time, the rightists shifted their focus from the "Hundred Flowers Society" to "Plaza." They gathered all the so-called "democratic fighters" together. "Plaza" became the main base for rightists throughout the school.

    The editorial board of "Plaza" was jointly formed by the "Hundred Flowers Society," "Hundred Flowers Forum," "Free Forum," and the Zhang (Yuanxun) Shen (Zeyi) poetry school, a grand alliance of rightists. All fifteen people who participated in the "Plaza" editorial board were well-known rightists in the school. Although rightists Tan Tianrong and Xu Nanting were not nominally on the editorial board, they actively participated in the work of "Plaza."

    Who were the core members of the reactionary clique "Plaza"? These fifteen people included Liu Qidi, a counter-revolutionary who had been released after being treated with leniency; Li Yansheng, who had twice sneaked into the women's bathroom, sentenced to eight months in prison for theft, and had just been released; Long Yinghua, a communist traitor; Li Yabai, who consistently stole books; Ye Yusheng, a coward who deserted the front lines during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, spreading rumors everywhere; Zhang Yuanxun, who sabotaged participation in the military cadre school, spread reactionary remarks, and was expelled from the Communist Youth League and had a blood feud for killing his brother; Chen Fengxiao, a reactionary bourgeois element... These people, who styled themselves as "democratic fighters," came from families of landlords, bureaucrats, and capitalists, accounting for eleven out of fifteen, or 75 percent. Before liberation, most of these people lived in the upper echelons of society, feeling superior to others. After liberation, in the various social reforms and movements, most of their parents and elder brothers were objects of mass struggle and reform. Among these fifteen rightists, 40 percent had direct relatives who were sentenced or executed by the people's courts. This is the historical and social root of why they hate the Party and socialism.

    Their Action Program
    After the core organization of rightists, the "Plaza" editorial board, was formed, they also formulated a unified action program that was reactionary and political. At the first preparatory meeting of "Plaza," fourteen guidelines were established. These guidelines were thoroughly anti-Party and anti-socialist. Their struggle guidelines were "to gradually shift the center to exploring the roots of the three evils, so that everyone clearly recognizes that the problem is not merely a matter of work style, but involves the national system." "We must strive for freedom of opinion and thoroughly realize the rights of speech, publication, assembly, and association. With free opinion, we can calmly reason and create social pressure to force the conservative forces to retreat." "Abolish the censorship system for publications, allow private newspapers and periodicals, otherwise there is no material guarantee of the policy of blooming and contending." Their guidelines also stipulated, "In order to gradually realize the above plan, we must make our organization the core of the current mass movement. Therefore, we should expand our influence through various forms, in addition to debates, speeches, discussion groups and other activities, gradually expanding our influence outside the school." Based on the situation in the school at the time, the rightists proposed: "We should be concerned about the urgent issues raised by the students, we should adopt a sharp and rigorous attitude, and we should make the organization a permanent one."

    From this, it can be seen that they selected the Party's leadership and socialism as the general goal of their attack. The reason they particularly emphasized "gradually shifting the center to exploring the roots of the three evils" and "clarifying that this is a matter of the national system" was to negate the leadership of the Party and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    They also particularly emphasized: "Striving for freedom of opinion," "thoroughly realizing the rights of speech, publication, assembly, and association," "abolishing the publication censorship system," and so on. The real purpose was to use the guise of "striving for socialist democracy" to allow these rightists and counter-revolutionaries, who had been deprived of their political rights by the people, to have the freedom to speak and act recklessly, so as to "create social pressure" and force the Communist Party to "retreat."

    The Reactionary Activities of "Plaza"
    After "Plaza" was published, the rightist backbone members shifted their focus from the "Hundred Flowers Society" to the "Plaza" editorial board and gathered more rightists together. The "Plaza" editorial board was no longer simply an organization that published periodicals, but a core organization of a reactionary clique of rightists, and the "Hundred Flowers Society" had actually become its outer organization.

    In order to realize their political conspiracy and implement their action program, these rightists, in addition to separately posting big-character posters, giving speeches, participating in debates, opening "philosophy lectures," and sending reactionary propaganda to various places, used "Plaza" as the main offensive position, and carried out activities outside the school in its organizational name.

    The editors of "Plaza" first actively carried out activities within the school. They claimed that "Plaza" was the school's own publication, a publication that was "anti-dogmatic," to deceive students and win their support. They held many secret meetings to discuss plans to attack the Party and socialism. Zhang Yuanxun, the editor-in-chief of "Plaza," said, "With a publication, it will be easy to do things. We can open fire on them." Cui Defu, the deputy editor-in-chief, said, "The publication should be distributed nationwide; the fire should be lit in every corner of the country."

    However, the rightists' beautiful plan did not come true. After seeing the catalog of "Plaza," the students saw through its reactionary face. Under the opposition of the students, it had to be renamed "Selected Essays from the Peking University Democracy Wall" before it could be published.

    Although the manuscripts for the first issue of "Plaza" were selected from big-character posters on the "Democracy Wall," every word and sentence was soaked in reactionary poison.

    Lighting Fires Everywhere, Bumping into Walls Everywhere
    While carrying out conspiratorial activities in the school, the "Plaza" editorial board also planned to "mobilize the people of the country in June to petition the National People's Congress and create a Hungarian incident on the streets." In order to implement their plan, in addition to carrying out written and verbal propaganda, they also secretly carried out some organizational activities. They made extensive contacts with rightists in various universities in Beijing. Chen Fengxiao, one of the main figures of "Plaza," went to Beijing Normal University to contact the two reactionary cliques, "Bitter Medicine" and "Voice of the Underclass," and instructed them that only opposing the school Party committee was "too narrow-minded and short-sighted, and in the future, they should deal with bigger problems and dig out the roots." Subsequently, the heads of these two organizations went to Peking University to obtain reactionary propaganda materials, attempting to subvert the school journal of Beijing Normal University, seize control of the radio station, and publish publications. They also incited rightists at the Beijing Institute of Geology and the Petroleum Institute to establish organizations of the "Hundred Flowers Society Branch." Han Hongpeng, the rightist leader at the Geological Institute, who was fostered by "Plaza," had always claimed that he wanted to kill all the communists.

    In order to establish a foothold in Tianjin, on June 2, Tan Tianrong and five others, posing as a "Peking University Visiting Group," went to Nankai University, Tianjin University, Tianjin Normal College, and other universities in Tianjin to light fires.

    In addition, they fancifully compiled seven reactionary articles they had written into a "Democracy Relay Baton" and widely distributed them to universities across the country.

    All these actions of the rightists had the opposite effect to what they intended. They ran into walls everywhere. Students from the Geological Institute, Agricultural Mechanization Institute, and other schools were very angry when they saw their reactionary activities and sent representatives to Peking University to expose them. Tan Tianrong and others could not say a few words in front of the students of Nankai University and Normal College in Tianjin before everyone saw their true colors as rightists and drove them off the stage. Wang Daqi, a fourth-year student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Tianjin University, was initially misled by them. After raising his awareness, he came to Peking University to expose Tan Tianrong's conspiracy. The schools that received the reactionary propaganda of the rightists also wrote letters to Peking University, protesting and criticizing Tan Tianrong.

    After discovering the reactionary remarks of "Plaza," the workers of the Beijing No. 1 Printing Factory immediately refused to typeset it, and reasoned with the rightists Zhang Yuanxun, Shen Zeyi, Zhang Jingzhong and others. How could these rightists out-argue the workers? They had to lie and say that it was not reactionary. However, that could not be denied! The workers resolutely refused to typeset "Plaza," leaving them humiliated.

    Complex External Connections
    The connection between "Plaza" and the rightists in society was also frequent and constant. They often went to the home of Lin Xiling, a rightist from the Renmin University of China, to discuss matters. Before the establishment of "Plaza," Lin Xiling had pointed out that "Tan Tianrong and Liu Qidi have no prestige" and could not serve on the editorial board, advocating "discovering some hidden talents." Cui Defu, the deputy editor-in-chief of "Plaza," had gone to Tan Tiwu's home to report the situation of "Plaza" to Lin Xiling. After the anti-rightist struggle began, Lin Xiling rebuked the editors of "Plaza" for clarifying her relationship with "Plaza." Another line was connected through Xu Nanting, an active supporter of "Plaza." Xu Nanting's father, Xu Hansan, was a confidant of Zhang Naiqi. Some secret reports and confidential documents obtained by Xu Nanting were conveyed at the secret meetings of "Plaza."

    On the morning of June 5, the "Plaza" editorial department posted a sensational big-character poster entitled "Save the Children, Plaza is in Difficult Labor!" saying that "Plaza" was in difficulty and asking students to lend, donate, or pay subscriptions to them. On the same morning, they also sent someone to the Jiusan Society to find Deputy Secretary-General Wang Zhixiang to ask for donations. There is a conversation here that is very thought-provoking. Wang Zhixiang said, "If the Party committee donates one yuan to you, we can donate one thousand yuan." They said, "We have money already, it doesn't matter how much you donate, we mainly hope you support us." Then, they also said that the paper and printing problems had been solved. And "Save Plaza" was just a smokescreen to prevent people from investigating its funding.

    The funding of this reactionary clique was very generous. It can be seen from one of their expenditure tables: one hundred yuan was spent on publicity in Tianjin, one hundred yuan on mimeographing leaflets... a total expenditure of more than 1,700 yuan. After Tan Tianrong returned from Tianjin, he wrote a letter to "Plaza" requesting that he be allocated "personal activity expenses." According to Zhang Yuanxun's initial confession, Chen Fengxiao had taken out more than 700 yuan, and this money was remitted to Chen Fengxiao by registered mail from "friends outside the school." Who are these "friends outside the school"? It is necessary to get to the bottom of this.

    Full-Scale Counterattack
    The reactionary activities of the reactionary clique of rightists, the "Hundred Flowers Society" and "Plaza," were met with a counterattack by the broad masses of students. Since the criticism of it began in mid-June, various large and small meetings have been held every day. After being exposed and refuted by the students of the whole school, they began to disintegrate and "retreat." On June 23, the "Hundred Flowers Society" held a members' meeting. At the meeting, Tan Tianrong, Liu Qidi and others were condemned for their anti-socialist words and deeds. On the spot, several members, including Hong Yunmei, jointly issued a statement of withdrawal from the society, expressing their firm determination to draw a clear line with the rightists. The "Plaza" editorial board also posted a big-character poster saying "Disband Plaza." However, the rightists were playing a double game. The day after they announced the dissolution of the "Plaza" editorial board, these "editors" held secret meetings one after another on Kunming Lake and at the Haidian Hotel, and made three decisions: first, silence; second, resolutely not admit that they were rightists; third, do it again after school starts next semester.

    These rightists adhere to the "principle of offensive and defensive alliance" to resist stubbornly. However, in the face of the powerful anti-rightist struggle, their offensive and defensive alliance has been continuously broken. Shen Zeyi, a rightist backbone member, had already made a review and confession at the criticism meeting of the whole school on the 20th, and pleaded guilty to the people. Some rightist backbone members have also expressed their remorse. Although this reactionary clique that was once rampant has disintegrated, there are still many rightists who are stubbornly resisting. Students are further expanding criticism to completely defeat the rightists' stronghold at Peking University.

    摧毁右派分子在北京大学的据点
    刘群、周定舫、江淮
    北京大学右派分子反动小集团——“百花学社”“广场”，这个一班人马，两个招牌的组织，经过月余的反右派的斗争，他们的阴谋被揭露出来了。受蒙骗的人逐渐觉悟过来；中间的群众都擦亮了眼睛，看清他们这一小撮右派分子所干的反党反社会主义勾当。这个集团内部已经开始分化，许多右派分子缴械投降。
    政治阴谋
    他们这个小集团，一开始就进行有计划有组织的活动，他们有明确的政治目的。他们的目的是：以北京大学为据点，通过刊物、社团，同全国高等学校的右派分子建立联系，把反党反社会主义的火，放到全国各高等学校去，然后蔓延到中学，把学校搞乱，再把这火放到工厂、农村。用右派分子的话说，他们是“团结孤军作战”的右派分子，所谓“民主战士”们，“进行长期斗争”，并“通过刊物来领导学生运动”，他们声言要“把发言权夺过来”，办和“党中央观点不同的刊物”。
    “广场”这个反动刊物还未组织之前，早在5月29日，北京大学的右派分子王国乡、崔德甫等和中国人民大学右派分子林希翎密谋商讨关于出版该刊物的组织、性质、目的和对当前情况的估计等问题。他们给自己确定了任务：“我们要走在前面，我们是点火人，我们要好好领导运动，我们启发群众”。
    新社会的垃圾堆
    正当学校党委有计划有步骤进行整风的时候，这个反动小集团“广场”，公开冒了出来，这时右派分子把重心从“百花学社”转到“广场”上来。他们把所谓“民主战士”都集合起来了。“广场”成为全校右派分子的大本营。
    “广场”编委会是由“百花学社”、“百花坛”、“自由论坛”张（元勋）、沈（泽宜）诗派联合组成的，是右派分子的大联合。参加“广场”编委会的十五个人，都是全校著名的右派分子。右派分子谭天荣、许南亭虽名义上没有在编委会里，但他们积极参加“广场”的工作。
    反动小集团“广场”的核心分子是些什么人？这十五个人，他们是被宽大释放的反革命分子刘奇弟；是两次潜入女浴室，因偷盗被判八个月徒刑，刚刚刑满的李燕生；是共产党叛徒龙英华；是一贯盗窃书籍的李亚白；是抗美援朝前线的怕死鬼——逃兵，到处造谣的叶于泩；是破坏参加军干校、散布反动言论和被开除团籍和有杀兄之仇的张元勋；是反动的资产阶级分子陈奉孝……。这些自封为“民主战士”的人，从他们的家庭出身来看：出身于地主、官僚、资本家家庭的就有十一人，占百分之七十五。这些人在解放前，大多数生活在上层社会，高人一等。解放后，在历次社会改造等运动当中，他们的父兄大部是群众斗争、改造的对象。这十五名右派分子中，有百分之四十的直系亲属被人民法院判刑、处死，这就是他们为什么仇视党和社会主义的历史根源和社会根源。
    他们的行动纲领
    右派分子核心组织“广场”编委会形成以后，他们还制定了统一行动的反动政治纲领。在“广场”第一次筹备会上，确定了十四条纲领。这些纲领彻头彻尾是反党反社会主义的。他们的斗争纲领是“逐步把中心移到探讨三害的根源，使大家明确认识，问题不单是作风，而是牵涉到国家制度。”“要争取舆论自由，彻底实现言论、出版、集会、结社的权利，有了自由的舆论，它就可以从容说理，造成社会压力，迫使保守势力退却”。“取消出版的检查制度，允许私人办报刊，否则鸣放的方针就没有物质保证”。他们的纲领还规定，“为了逐步实现以上计划，必须使自己的社团成为当前运动群众的核心。为此，应该通过各种形式扩大影响，此外配合以辩论会、讲演、讨论会等活动方式，想逐渐把影响扩大到校外去。”右派分子们根据当时学校的情况，提出：“应该关心同学们提出的迫切问题，应采取尖锐严谨的态度，应使社团成为长久性的组织”。
    从这里可以看出，他们选定党的领导和社会主义，作为他们进攻的总的目标。他们所以特别强调要“逐步把中心移到探讨三害根源”上去，“明确这是国家制度”问题，目的就是妄想用这个来否定党的领导和无产阶级专政。
    他们还特别强调：“争取舆论自由”，“彻底实现言论、出版、集会、结社的权利”，“取消出版检查制度”，等等，真正目的就是为了打着“争取社会主义民主”的幌子，以达到这些右派分子以及被人民剥夺政治权利的反革命分子有乱说乱动的自由以后，以便“造成社会压力，”迫使共产党“退却”。
    “广场”的反动活动
    “广场”出版后，右派骨干分子就把重心从“百花学社”转到了“广场”的编委会，并且结集了更多的右派分子。“广场”编委会已经不单纯是一个出版刊物的机构，而是一个右派分子反动小集团的核心组织，“百花学社”实际上已成为它的外围组织。
    为了实现他们的政治阴谋，贯彻他们的行动纲领，这些右派分子除去分别的贴大字报、演说、参加辩论、开“哲学讲座”、向各地寄发宣传品，进行反动宣传以外，更以“广场”作为主要的进攻阵地，并以它的组织名义，在校外开展活动。
    “广场”的编委们，首先就在校内积极地活动起来。他们声言“广场”是全校学生自己的刊物，是“反教条主义”的刊物，来骗取学生的支持。他们举行了许多次的秘密会议，商讨向党向社会主义进攻的计划。“广场”主编张元勋说，“有了刊物就好办了，可以向他们开炮了。”副主编王国卿说，“刊物要发行全国；把火点到全国各个角落。”
    可是，右派分子的美妙计划没有实现，同学们看到了“广场”的目录以后，就识破它的反动面貌。在同学们的反对下，它不得不改名为“北大民主墙选辑”出版。
    第一期“广场”的稿子虽是从“民主墙”上的大字报里选出来的，但它每字每句都是在反动的毒汁里浸过的。
    到处点火，到处碰壁
    “广场”编委们于在校内进行阴谋活动的同时，还计划在“6月份发动全国人民向人代会请愿，上街搞匈牙利事件”。为了实行他们的计划，除去进行文字的、口头的宣传以外，还秘密进行一些组织活动。他们与北京各院校的右派分子，进行广泛的联系。“广场”主将之一陈奉孝去北京师范大学同该校的“苦药”、“底层之声”两个反动小集团联系，指示他们只反对学校党委，是“气量太小，眼光短浅，以后应当搞大问题，挖苦根”。接着，这两个社团的负责人就到北大取去了反动宣传品，企图搞垮北京师范大学的校刊，掌握广播台，出刊物。他们还策动在北京地质学院和石油学院的右派分子，成立了“百花学社支社”的组织。“广场”一手扶植的地质学院右派头目韩鸿鹏，一直声称要杀完所有的共产党员。
    右派分子为了在天津扎根，6月2日，谭天荣等六人，冒充“北大访问团”名义，前去天津南开大学、天津大学、天津师范学院等各院校点火。
    除此以外，他们还异想天开地把他们自己写的七篇反动文章，编成“民主接力棒”，广泛地散发到全国各地高等学校中。
    右派分子所有这些行动，效果都与他们的打算完全相反。他们到处碰壁。地质学院、农业机械化学院等校学生看到他们的反动活动，非常愤慨，派了代表到北京大学去揭发。谭天荣等在天津南开大学和师范学院学生面前讲不几句话，大家就看出了他们的右派分子的真面目，将他们轰下台去。天津大学机械系四年级学生王大齐，当初受了他们的迷惑，在提高觉悟后，就来北京大学揭发谭天荣的阴谋。收到右派分子反动宣传品的学校，也都纷纷给北京大学写信，对谭天荣提出抗议和批判。
    北京印刷一厂工人发现了“广场”的反动言论以后，马上就拒绝排印，并且和右派分子张元勋、沈泽宜、张景中等人讲理。这些右派分子怎么能讲过工人呢？只好胡赖，说那不是反动言论。可是，那是赖不掉的！工人们坚决不排印“广场”，让他们碰了一鼻子灰回去。
    对外的复杂联系
    “广场”与社会上的右派分子的联系也是经常的、频繁的。他们经常到中国人民大学右派分子林希翎那里商量。林希翎在“广场”成立前，曾指出“谭天荣和刘奇弟没有威信”，不能担任编委，主张“另发现一些隐名能人。”“广场”副主编崔德甫曾到谭惕吾家里向林希翎汇报“广场”的情况。反右派斗争开始后，林希翎责备“广场”编委为什么把她和“广场”的关系明确化。另一条线是通过“广场”的积极支持者许南亭联系的，许南亭的父亲许汉三是章乃器的亲信。许南亭得到的一些秘密报告和秘密文件，都在“广场”的秘密会议上进行传达。
    6月5日上午“广场”编辑部贴出“救救孩子，广场在难产中！”的煽动性大字报，说“广场”有困难，要求同学们贷款、捐款或交订费给他们。就在同一天上午，他们又派人去九三学社找副秘书长王之相要求捐款。这里有一段对话，非常引人深思。王之相说，“如果党委捐一块钱给你们，我们可以捐一千元。”他们说，“我们早就有钱了，你们捐多少没有关系，主要是希望你们支持。”接着，他们又表示纸张、印刷问题都已解决。而“救救广场”不过是一个烟幕，使人们不去追究它的经费问题。
    这个反动集团的经费是很宽裕的，从他们的一张支出表中可以看出：到天津去宣传花去一百元，油印传单一百元……共计支出一千七百多元。而谭天荣从天津回来以后，曾写信给“广场”，要求拨给他“个人活动经费”。经费的来源，据张元勋初步交代，陈奉孝曾先后掏出了七百多元，这些钱都是“校外朋友”用挂号信汇给陈奉孝的。这些“校外朋友”是什么人呢？是必须搞个水落石出的。
    全线反击
    右派分子反动小集团“百花学社”、“广场”的反动活动，遭到广大同学们的反击。从6月中旬对它展开批判以来，各种大会小会天天在进行着。经全校学生的揭露和批驳后，它们开始分化和“退却”。6月23日，“百花学社”举行了社员大会。会上，谴责了谭天荣、刘奇弟等人反社会主义的言行。当场，就有洪允楣等几个社员联合发表了退社声明，表示坚决与右派分子划清界线。“广场”编委会也曾贴出一张“解散广场”的大字报。但是，右派分子们却在耍两面派手法。就在他们宣布“广场”编委会解散的第二天，这些“编委”们就在昆明湖上、在海淀酒店接连召开了秘密会议，并作出三条决定：一，沉默；二，坚决不承认自己是右派分子；三，下学期开学后再干。
    这些右派分子坚守“攻守同盟原则”来进行顽抗。但在声势浩大的反右派斗争面前，他们的攻守同盟又连续被击破。右派骨干分子沈泽宜，已在20日全校学生的批判大会上，作了检讨交代，向人民请罪。有的右派骨干分子，也纷纷表示悔过。这个嚣张一时的反动小集团虽然已经分化，但是还有不少右派分子顽抗。广大学生正在进一步展开批判，来彻底打垮右派分子在北京大学的据点。
