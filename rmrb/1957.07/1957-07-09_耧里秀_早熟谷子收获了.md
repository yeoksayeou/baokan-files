    "Louli Xiu"
    Early Millet Harvested

  This newspaper reports that nearly one hundred mu of early-maturing millet, "Louli Xiu," planted by the Chengguan and Dengta Agricultural Cooperatives in Xinle County, Hebei Province, has been harvested and brought in. According to the threshing that has already taken place, twenty-three jin and twelve liang of millet have been harvested from slightly more than a quarter of a mu, which translates to a yield of over 500 jin per mu.

    This type of millet is sown during the "Spring Equinox" and can be harvested during the "Summer Solstice," with a growing period of only about ninety days. It can be planted on various types of soil (for example, when planted in sandy soil, more fertilizer can be applied to increase the yield), and it is more labor-saving than planting other varieties of millet (only one weeding is needed after the seedlings emerge). Because it is harvested early, planting it in low-lying and flood-prone areas can avoid floods and insect pests; planting it in areas with insufficient grain can prevent famine. "Louli Xiu" also has a high milling rate. The milling rate of ordinary millet varieties is only 60%, while "Louli Xiu" can reach 80%. However, "Louli Xiu" millet also has some shortcomings. That is, the stalks are short (only about one chi tall), and the rice is not very sticky (not suitable for making porridge).

    The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Agricultural Bureau has notified Xinle County to reserve 12,000 jin of "Louli Xiu" seeds in preparation for promoting it throughout the entire prefecture. (Pei Guoxun)

    “耧里秀”
    早熟谷子收获了
  本报讯　河北新乐县城关和灯塔两个农业社种植的近百亩早熟谷子——耧里秀，已经收割登场了。据已经收打的情况看，四分一厘多地共收谷子二十三斤十二两，折合一亩能收五百多斤。
    这种谷子在“春分”播种，“夏至”即可收获，成长期只有九十来天。它可以在各种土质的土地上种植（如在沙土地内种植，只要多施肥料，就能多收），而且比种别的品种的谷子省工（苗子出土后，只要锄一次）。因为它收获早，在低洼易涝地区种植，可以避免水灾和虫灾；在粮食不足的地区种植，可以防荒。“耧里秀”的出米率也高，一般品种的谷子出米率只有60％，而“耧里秀”能达到80％。但是，“耧里秀”谷子也有一些缺点。这就是秸秆低（只有一尺来高），米的粘性不大（不适于做稀饭）。
    石家庄专署农业局已通知新乐县，留一万二千斤“耧里秀”种子，准备在全专区推广。　（裴国勋）
