    Questioning Huang Shaohong
    -- I Have No Grievance to Air, Why Are You Airing a Grievance for Me? What Are Your Intentions?
    Liu Maolin
    In the People's Daily on July 16th, I saw Huang Shaohong's speech. He said: "At the CPPCC symposium, based on some letters from the people, 99% of which were from counter-revolutionaries or their families, or incidents seen and heard during inspections, I casually reflected on them without analysis and research, such as reflecting on... the Liu Maolin problem at the Railway Elementary School..." These words made me very astonished. I do not know Huang Shaohong, and neither I nor my family have written to him. He has not "inspected" my school either. Why would he know about the "Liu Maolin problem" and even take it to the CPPCC symposium to "casually reflect" on it? What exactly is the so-called "Liu Maolin problem"?
    Before liberation, when I was studying at Beijing Municipal Normal School, I joined the Three People's Principles Youth League. After graduation, I went to work at Xizhimen Rotary Elementary School. There was a special agent at the school, and I had some dealings with him. On the eve of liberation, when he fled to Nanjing, I gave him a pair of sneakers. After liberation, I joined the Communist Youth League. However, I did not clearly explain my activities in the Three People's Principles Youth League. I also did not mention my dealings with the special agent. In addition, I had some reactionary and muddled ideas. Especially after seeing the constant exposure of special agent cases in the newspapers, I was deeply afraid of being implicated and became fearful. However, due to insufficient awareness and a lack of firm stance, I had many concerns: I was afraid of worrying my mother, afraid that the organization would no longer trust me, and afraid of losing prestige among the masses. Therefore, I was unwilling to confess to the organization, procrastinating day after day.
    At that time, the organization trusted me very much. I served as the chairman of the trade union, but precisely because of my inner turmoil, I was never at ease in my work. I had no long-term plans in my work, as if I was always preparing to make a confession. When I returned home and saw everyone happy, I was both jealous and angry. I was irritable, did not greet my neighbors, and was not patient in helping my niece with her homework. My niece's teeth were bad, but I had no mind to take her to the doctor. I always finished my meals in a hurry, unable to taste anything. I was unwilling to save any extra money, spending it casually because I had no confidence in my future and did not know what my fate would be. Young as I was, I felt like I would have one less chance to see my loved one each time we met. I was truly in a state of "startled by the rustling of leaves in the wind, seeing every bush as an enemy."
    In the summer vacation of 1955, the learning for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries began. The study group specially convened a meeting of Party and League members, putting forward strict requirements, including the statement "Failure to report known information will result in expulsion from the Party or League." After the meeting, I used my rest time to write down some of my reactionary and muddled thoughts and criticized them. At the same time, I confessed my social connections and reported some suspicious situations in my work unit. However, I did not mention my activities in the Three People's Principles Youth League or my dealings with the special agent. After writing it, I submitted it automatically. In the small group study sessions, I also took the initiative to examine myself. Everyone criticized my reactionary and muddled thoughts, and I felt very uncomfortable, beginning to stubbornly argue. The first meeting ended in discord. At this time, the organization began to help me and began to enlighten me from my work, saying, "Why is the work not done well?" At the time, I felt that such a judgment was wrong. I did not answer, only pointing to the fountain pen given to me by the trade union, meaning, "If the work is bad, where did the pen come from?" I gave him the cold shoulder. Afterwards, the organization often talked to me, but instead of humbly examining myself, I developed an antagonistic attitude. I had a premonition that a struggle against me was inevitable, and I began to express sympathy for those being struggled against, saying behind their backs: "Whoever struggles wrongly will be responsible." The leaders and the masses linked my behavior with my historical problems, expressing suspicion towards me and conducting a small group struggle. The storm came, and my panicked appearance made people even more suspicious. Their questions were so sharp and their stance so clear that it was a wake-up call for me, making me realize that I needed to settle accounts with my consistent guiding ideology. The comrades were very enthusiastic, aiming to make me confess my historical political problems and my social connections. Although I adopted a stubborn attitude of refusing to confess, the comrades continued to analyze, help, analyze again, and help again. After individual help from the leaders, I finally confessed all my problems.
    The office for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was particularly concerned about my work morale, telling me to be at ease in my work. The Party and League leaders, as well as the branch committee, all gave me individual help, specifically discussing my ideological problems and stance problems, explaining them in such an in-depth, simple, and easy-to-understand way that I gained a lot. The League organization also held a special branch meeting for me, based on the facts, helping me to systematically criticize my words and deeds before and after liberation. Finally, they also put forward hopes for me in all aspects, allowing me to completely settle accounts with everything in the past. The series of education I received from the organization gradually increased my awareness and strengthened my revolutionary stance. I felt that the education I received in this movement was better than the total of six years of learning after liberation. I realized that the organization had always cared for me, that the organization had not forgotten me, and that I had let the organization down in many ways. Later, my problems were clarified, and a conclusion was made as a historical issue. I was not given any administrative punishment, only an appropriate punishment within the League. A weight was lifted from my heart. I got rid of my burden completely, and I felt relaxed and happy. The subsequent issues were only to strive for the revocation of the punishment and to better serve the people. I began to be active. My work situation was completely the opposite of what it was before the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. My work was solid, at ease, and had long-term plans, and my efficiency was also high. My relationship with my comrades was closer, my temper was no longer irritable, I was kind to my neighbors, I could systematically help my niece with her studies, I was willing to properly manage my salary, and I loved my children. In short, I saw my bright future and began to live normally.
    The organization trusted me even more. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, my salary was rated at level two, and my monthly salary increased by fourteen yuan. The economy in my home was obviously more prosperous. In addition to my elementary school work, I was also allowed to concurrently teach history in the middle school class, participate in security work, and serve as the head of the teaching and research group and the head of the study group. With the help of my superiors and comrades, my work made some achievements. In the school's award evaluation at the end of 1956, I was awarded the second prize and received a bonus. My sense of responsibility to the school became stronger and stronger. The People's Daily editorial said: "Clarifying their doubts, drawing conclusions, and relieving them of their mental burden will facilitate their active work. This is beneficial to the people's cause and to themselves." I personally experienced that this was absolutely true. I deeply felt the greatness and correctness of the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and felt the warmth of the organization. I did not, as the rightist Huang Shaohong imagined, stand in opposition to the Party. The organization was not wrong, and I was not wronged. The conclusion was not "counter-revolutionary." For me, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was done well, not messed up.
    Why did Huang Shaohong raise the "Liu Maolin problem"? His younger sister works in my school and personally participated in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. According to her, she "sympathized" with me and told others about me. It just so happened that Huang Shaohong was wearing tinted glasses, looking everywhere for anti-Party and anti-socialist political capital. He instinctively "paid attention to correcting mistakes" and "cried injustice for counter-revolutionaries," and then went to "casually reflect" on the "Liu Maolin problem." As a people's representative, can the four words "casually reflect" be explained away?

### 质问黄绍竑——我无冤要申，你为我申冤，居心何在？

    质问黄绍竑
    ——我无冤要申，你为我申冤，居心何在？
    刘茂林
    在7月16日的人民日报上，看到黄绍竑的发言。他说：“我在政协座谈会上根据一些人民来信，99％都是反革命分子或其家属的来信，或视察中所见所闻的事件，不加分析研究随便反映，如反映……铁道小学的刘茂林问题……。”这些话使我非常惊异。我和黄绍竑素不相识，我和我的家属并没有给他去信，他也没到我校“视察”，为什么他会知道“刘茂林问题”，而且拿到政协座谈会上去“随便反映”呢？所谓“刘茂林问题”又是怎么回事呢？
    解放以前，我在北京市立师范学校念书的时候，加入了三青团。毕业后到西直门扶轮小学工作，校中有个特务，我和他有些往来，解放前夕，他逃到南京去时，我曾送给他一双球鞋。解放以后，我入了团。可是，我在三青团的活动并没有交代清楚。和特务的往来也没有提。加之我还有一些反动、糊涂思想。特别见到报纸上不断揭发特务的案子，我深怕连累上我，开始恐惧起来。但是由于觉悟不够，立场不坚定，因此，顾虑很多：怕母亲着急，怕组织上不再相信自己，怕在群众中失去威信，便不肯向组织上坦白，拖一天算一天。
    当时，组织对我很信任，我担任工会主席，可是，就是因为心里有病，工作上总不安心，工作中没有长远计划，好像随时要准备着办交代。回到家里，见到大家快快乐乐，我又嫉妒又生气，脾气暴躁，也不和邻居打招呼，不耐心帮助侄女温课，侄女的牙齿坏了，也没有心思带她去治。饭总是匆匆地吃完，吃不出什么味道，有富裕钱也不肯储蓄，随便用掉，因为对自己的前途没有信心，不知道自己是个什么结局，年青青的，对自己的爱人也有见一次少一次的感觉，真是“风声鹤唳，草木皆兵”。
    1955年暑假，开始了肃反学习。学习班特别召集党团员开了一次会，对党团员提出了严格的要求，其中有“知情不报，开除党籍、团籍”的话。会后，我便利用休息时间，把自己的一些反动思想、糊涂思想写了出来，并进行了批判，同时交代了社会关系，又检举了一些本单位可疑的情况。可是对于三青团的活动，以及和特务的往来，并没有提，写好了就自动交了上去。在小组学习会上，也主动争取检查自己。大家对我的反动思想和糊涂思想进行了批判，我感到很不舒服，开始顽固地辩驳。第一次会闹个不欢而散。这时组织上对我开始了帮助，同时由工作上开始启发我，说：“为什么工作做得不好呢？”我当时认为这样武断是不对的，我没有回答，只指着工会奖给我的钢笔叫他看，意思是说，工作坏哪里来的钢笔？给他软钉子碰。以后，组织上常找我谈话，我不但没有更虚心的检查，反而产生了对抗情绪，我有一种预感：对我的斗争难免了，我对于被斗的对象便开始表示同情，背后对他说：谁斗错了谁负责。领导上和群众把我的表现和历史问题联系起来看，对我表示怀疑，便进行了小组斗争。暴风骤雨来了，我的恐慌样子，越发使人怀疑。他们的问题那样尖锐，立场那样鲜明，对我真是一个当头棒喝，使我猛醒。首先我感到需要清算自己的一贯的主导思想了。同志们热情很高，目的是要我交代历史政治问题，交代社会关系。我虽然采取了拒不坦白的顽抗态度，可是同志们还是继续分析，帮助，再分析，再帮助，又经过领导上的个别帮助，终于使我把所有的问题坦白出来了。
    肃反办公室特别关心我的工作情绪，告诉我工作中要安心。党、团的负责人，以及分团委，全对我进行了个别帮助，专门和我谈了思想问题，立场问题，讲得是那样深入浅出，通俗易懂，使我有好多收获。团组织还特别为我开了支部会，根据事实，帮助我把解放前后的言行，进行了系统的批判。最后还从各方面提出对我的希望，使我把过去的一切，整个清算一番。组织上对我一系列的教育，逐步提高了我的觉悟，坚定了我的革命立场。我感到在这次运动中受到的教育，胜过了解放以后六年学习的总和。我认识到，组织是一贯关怀我的，组织并没有忘掉我，而我在很多方面是对不起组织的。后来，我的问题弄清楚了，作为历史问题作了结论，并没有给予行政处分，只在团内给予适当处分。我心里的一块石头落了地。包袱彻底丢掉了，轻松愉快了，以后的问题只是争取撤消处分，和更好地为人民服务了。我开始积极起来。工作情况和肃反以前完全相反。工作踏实、安心，有长远的计划，效率也高了。和同志们的关系更密切了，脾气也不暴躁了，对邻居也和蔼起来了，能够系统地帮助侄女学习了，薪水也肯好好支配了，对孩子也疼爱起来了。总之，我看到了自己光明的前途，开始正常地生活了。
    组织上对于我，也更加信任了。肃反以后，薪金给我评在二级，月薪增加了十四元，家中的经济，显然宽裕了。除了我的小学工作以外，又让我兼任中学班的历史课，参加保卫工作，担任教研组长，学习小组长。由于上级和同志们的帮助，使我的工作有了一些成绩，在1956年底学校评奖中，我被评上二等奖，得了奖金。我对学校的责任感也越来越强。人民日报的社论说：“对他们弄清了疑点，做出了结论，使他们去掉了精神负担，便于积极工作。这无论对于人民事业或者对于他们本人，都是有利的”，我亲身体验到这是千真万确的。深深感到肃反政策的伟大和正确，感到组织的温暖。我并没有像右派分子黄绍竑想像的那样，和党对立起来。组织没有错，我也不冤，结论也不是“反革命”。对我来说，肃反是搞好了，而不是搞糟了。
    黄绍竑为什么提出了“刘茂林问题”呢？他的妹妹是在我校工作，亲身参加了肃反，据她说是“同情”我，把关于我的事说了出去。恰好黄绍竑戴着有色眼镜在到处寻觅反党反社会主义的政治资本，他本能地“注意有错必纠”和“为反革命分子喊冤”，便去“随便反映”“刘茂林问题”了。做为人民代表，“随便反映”四个字，交代得下去么？
