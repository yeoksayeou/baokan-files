    The Difficult Situation of the US Policy towards China
    by George Wheeler, American writer

    The British relaxation of trade restrictions against China, coupled with the strong protests of the Taiwanese people against the US occupation policy, has violently shaken the US State Department's Far East policy. Various trends are developing, reflecting sharp and ever-widening contradictions between economic, political, and military goals.

    The US State Department pretends that China does not exist, except for Taiwan. However, everything involving the Chinese government is vehemently condemned. This policy seems naive and is regarded as "unrealistic and ineffective." But this oversimplifies the matter. Representatives of Wall Street have their shrewd plans for dealing with complex situations beyond their control and have chosen a path they consider most advantageous.

    There are multiple reasons for the US to initiate an embargo against China. First, it is suitable for maintaining international tensions, conforms to US military plans, and supports the fallacy that the People's Republic of China does not exist. Compared to Japan and Britain, the US suffers far less from the embargo against China, and some of the losses have been compensated by countries that have become more dependent on the US market. In recent years, economic conditions in various countries have changed greatly, and Britain has finally realized that it must have a different trade policy towards China than that of American capitalists. Other countries have followed Britain's example. This forces the United States to reconsider the economic aspects of its policy towards China. If other capitalist countries begin to supply China with machinery and equipment, then the argument that continuing the embargo against China can hinder the development of "Red China" will no longer hold. On the other hand, after other countries relax the embargo, especially if the State Department allows Japan and China to trade, some competitors will be drawn away from Latin America and other markets where American manufacturers are currently encountering difficulties.

    For this reason, we find that some conservatives in the US Senate, such as Senator Johnson of Texas, are launching a movement to reconsider the US embargo policy. Southern senators hope that Japanese textiles will find a larger market in China so that they will buy more American cotton. Therefore, they cautiously hint that a "new look" may not be a bad thing. But there is no pressure yet to drastically modify economic policy.

    In political and military terms, the reaction to Britain's actions is very different. Secretary of State Dulles and Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson are almost frantically defending the current embargo and the policy of non-recognition of China. This is because they recognize that this is a foundation for the entire US Far East policy, and if this foundation does not exist, the entire building will collapse. This policy is built on concealing the situation in China from the American people. The policy of blocking news from China is already very unpopular, and once trade with China is allowed, it will be impossible to continue to hide the significant and practical changes taking place there, and then more people will demand the restoration of China's seat in the United Nations and the US recognition of the People's Republic of China. This would expose the fact that Chiang Kai-shek has no right to represent the Chinese people and that Chiang Kai-shek's regime is maintained only by US military power, and further negate the fabricated claim that the Chiang Kai-shek regime represents, for example, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. The US State Department believes, for some reason, that this fabrication has great value.

    If Chiang Kai-shek falls (he inevitably will), the US military situation in Taiwan will be even more difficult than it is now. But this is not the worst consequence. US military authorities are particularly afraid that losing Taiwan will inevitably encourage a "Yankee Go Home" movement throughout Southeast Asia.

    Restoring China's legitimate status in the United Nations would weaken US hegemony within the United Nations and greatly strengthen the international organization, thereby helping to restore its inherent goal of promoting peaceful coexistence. This event, coinciding with a new high tide of calls against the danger of atomic war, could spur genuine rather than sham action on disarmament. In any case, this pressure is growing, and the crisis in China policy may lead to demands for large cuts in military spending. If this is done, many bourgeois economists fear that it will accelerate the long-delayed arrival of the US economic crisis.

    From this, it can be seen why the US State Department is clinging to a policy that seemed "unrealistic" from the beginning. This is because the interests of US monopoly capital are threatened, and the danger is even greater in the long run, although the American people will benefit from changing this policy.

    美国对华政策的困难处境
    美国作家　乔治·惠勒
    英国放宽对中国的贸易限制，加上台湾人民的强烈抗议美国占领政策，猛烈地动摇了美国国务院的远东政策。各种不同的趋向正在发展，这些不同的趋向，反映了在经济、政治和军事目标之间尖锐而又不断扩大的矛盾。
    美国国务院假装除了台湾以外，中国就不存在。然而，凡是涉及中国政府的每一件事，却又进行猛烈的谴责。这种政策看来很幼稚，而且被视为“不现实和没有效果的”。但是这样未免把事情看得过于简单。华尔街的代表对于应付自己力量所不能控制的复杂局势，自有其精明的打算，而且选择了一条他们认为最为有利的道路。
    美国发起对中国施行禁运有多种原因。首先，它适宜于维持国际紧张局势，也符合美国的军事计划，并且支持了中华人民共和国不存在的谬论。同日本和英国比较，美国对华实施禁运损失要少得多，而且一部分损失已经由那些对美国市场增加依赖性的国家所补偿了。近年来各国经济情况已有很大变化，英国终于认识到必须要有一种和美国资本家迥然不同的对华贸易政策。其他一些国家也追随了英国的榜样。这迫使美国在对华政策的经济方面重新进行考虑。如果其他资本主义国家开始供给中国机器和设备，那么继续对中国执行禁运可以阻滞“红色中国”发展的论调就再也站不住脚。另一方面，在其他国家放宽禁运之后，特别是假如国务院允许日本和中国进行贸易，就会将一些竞争者，从目前美国制造商正在遇到困难的拉丁美洲和其他市场中吸引过去。
    由于这种原因，我们发现在美国参议院的一些保守派分子中，譬如得克萨斯州参议员约翰逊，正在开展一项重新考虑美国禁运政策的运动。南方参议员希望日本的纺织品在中国得到更大的市场，这样他们就会购买更多的美棉。因此，他们慎重地暗示，“新面貌”未始不是一桩好事。但是目前还未形成一种压力，促使剧烈修改经济政策。
    在政治和军事方面，英国的行动引起的反应就大不相同。国务卿杜勒斯和负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊，近乎疯狂地捍卫现行的禁运和不承认中国的政策。这是因为他们认识到这是构成美国的整个远东政策的一项基础，如果这项基础不存在，全部建筑就会崩溃。这项政策是建筑在对美国人民蒙蔽中国情况之上。封锁中国新闻的政策已经非常不得人心，一旦允许和中国进行贸易，就无法继续隐瞒那里正在发生的重大和实际变化的事实，而且，接着就会有更多的人提出恢复中国在联合国席位和美国承认中华人民共和国的要求。这样一来，就会暴露蒋介石没有权利代表中国人民的事实，并且也暴露了只是由于美国的军事力量才保持了蒋介石的政权的事实，进而否定了这样一种捏造的说法——蒋介石政权是代表譬如在东南亚的华侨的。美国国务院由于某种原因，认为这种捏造是具有很大价值的。
    如果蒋介石垮台了（他必然要垮台），美国在台湾的军事处境就会比现在还要困难。但是这还不是最坏的后果。美国军事当局特别害怕，丢了台湾，势必会在整个东南亚鼓励了“让美国佬滚蛋”的运动。
    恢复中国在联合国的合法地位，就会削弱美国在联合国内的霸权，并且大为加强这个国际组织，从而有助于恢复它固有的促进和平共处的目标。这件事，正巧发生在反对原子战争危险的呼声达到新高潮的时候，它能促使对裁军采取真正而不是虚假的行动。无论如何，这种压力正在增长，而对华政策的危机可能引起要求大量削减军事开支。如果这样做了，许多资产阶级经济学家担心将会加速长期拖延了的美国经济危机的到来。
    从这里可以看出，美国国务院对从开头起就显得很“不现实”的政策抓紧不放的原因。这是因为美国垄断资本的利益受到威胁，而且从长远来看，危险性还要更大，虽然美国人民将因改变这种政策而得益。　（林龙铁译）
