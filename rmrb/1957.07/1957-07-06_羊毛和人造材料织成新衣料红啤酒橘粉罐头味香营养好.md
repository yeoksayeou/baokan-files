Xinhua News Agency, July 5th: This year, China's food, textile, and other industrial sectors have successfully trial-produced and put into production many new products.

In the food industry, the wine, sugar, and canned goods industries have new products meeting consumers. The Happiness brand red beer trial-produced by the Beijing Brewery is similar in color to red wine, has both the aroma of wine and the aroma of malt, and contains rich protein and vitamins. The dry red wine, longan wine, rose muscat wine, and a white spirit with added sugar and spices trial-produced by the Beijing Winery have also been put on the market. In order to produce as much candy as possible to meet consumer needs this year, in the situation of insufficient raw sugar supply, the Tianjin Kisling Food Factory successfully trial-produced 19 new varieties of soft candy and fruit-filled candy in the first quarter. Shanghai Food Factory No. 1 also used the leftover orange pieces and idle equipment from making orange canned goods to trial-produce orange powder canned goods. The orange powder in the canned goods can be mixed with water to make delicious orange juice.

The textile industry has produced more than 20 new wool textile products this year. Among the new products, most are overcoat fabrics, serge, and tweed blended with wool and man-made materials. They are generally soft and wear-resistant, and have good tensile strength. Their elasticity is slightly worse than pure wool fabrics, but the cost and selling price are cheaper than pure wool fabrics.

    羊毛和人造材料织成新衣料红啤酒橘粉罐头味香营养好
    据新华社5日讯  我国食品、纺织等工业部门今年又有很多种新产品试制成功和投入生产。
    食品工业中酒、糖、罐头行业都有新产品同消费者见了面。北京啤酒厂试制出来的幸福牌红啤酒，跟红葡萄酒的颜色差不多，既有酒的香味又有麦芽香味，同时含有丰富的蛋白质和维生素。北京酿酒厂试制成功的红干葡萄酒、龙眼葡萄酒、玫瑰香葡萄酒和一种加了糖及香料的白酒，也都已经上市。为了在今年原料糖供应不足的情况下尽量多生产一些糖果来满足消费者的需要，天津起士林食品厂在第一季度试制成功了十九种新品种的软糖和中间夹有水果的糖。上海食品一厂也利用做橘子罐头剩下的碎橘子和闲置设备试制了橘粉罐头，把罐头中的橘粉用水冲开，就能作成鲜美可口的橘汁。
    纺织工业今年已经生产了二十多种毛纺织新产品。新产品中，用羊毛和人造材料混纺的大衣呢、哔叽、花呢占多数。它们一般都柔软耐磨，拉力也好，就是弹性略比纯毛织品差，但成本、售价比纯毛织品便宜。
