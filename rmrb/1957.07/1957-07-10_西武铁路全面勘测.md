Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 6th: A comprehensive survey has begun for the Xi (an) - Wu (wei) Railway, an important trunk line of the Northwest railway network.

The Xi-Wu Railway will pass through the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region and the future Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and is of great significance to the development of the economy of the old revolutionary base areas and minority nationality areas. Xi'an is on the Longhai Railway, and Wuwei is on the Lanxin Railway. The construction of this railway, running parallel to the western section of the Longhai Railway, can reduce the excessively heavy transportation tasks of the western section of the Longhai Railway and ensure the increasing transportation of goods and materials in the Northwest. In the future, goods and materials transported from the Soviet Union through the Lanxin Railway to North China and Northeast China can also pass through the western section of the Xi-Wu Railway and then be transported northward via the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway. This route is several hundred kilometers shorter than going around Lanzhou.

The eastern side of this railway is overlapping mountains, the western side has large deserts, and the central area is an earthquake zone. Therefore, the surveyors must collect a large amount of topographic, geological, hydrological, and alignment selection data in difficult environments, and make detailed comparative plans in order to survey an economically reasonable line.

    西武铁路全面勘测
    新华社兰州6日电　西北铁路网的一条重要干线——西（安）武（威）铁路开始全面勘测。
    西武铁路将经过陕甘宁边区和未来的宁夏回族自治区，对发展老区和少数民族地区经济的关系很大。西安在陇海线上，武威在兰新线上，建设这条同陇海路西段并行的铁路，可以减低陇海路西段过重的运输任务，保证西北愈来愈多的物资运输。将来由苏联通过兰新路运往华北、东北的物资，也可以借道西武铁路的西段，再经过包兰铁路北运，这样比绕道兰州可以少走好几百公里的路。
    这条铁路的东边是重叠的山岭，西面有大沙漠，中部一带是地震区，因此勘测人员要在艰苦的环境里收集大量地形、地质、水文、选线等资料，做详细的比较方案，以便勘测出一条经济合理的线路来。
