    Half-Month Agricultural Situation
    Minor Heat (July 7th) - Major Heat (July 23rd)
    During these past two weeks, the basic situation of agricultural production in various regions is as follows: In the provinces of the Yangtze River Basin, the harvesting of early rice has entered a tense stage, and the transplanting of late rice has also begun; in the northern provinces, the spring-sown crops are growing vigorously, with most spring corn, spring millet, and sorghum, etc., already budding, heading, and flowering; the summer-sown crops that have already been planted are generally emerging well, and thinning, topdressing, and weeding are now beginning; in the northeastern and northwestern provinces, the harvesting of spring wheat is expected to be basically completed around mid-August. Currently, there is still drought in the Northwest region, and drought conditions are also present in Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Zhejiang, Wenzhou, and parts of Guangxi; many areas in Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces have recently suffered from floods and waterlogging due to prolonged heavy rain; farmers in the above-mentioned areas are vigorously carrying out drought resistance and drainage work.
    
    Intensify the Harvesting of Early Rice
    Over one hundred million mu of single-season and double-season early rice in the southern provinces has generally matured and harvesting has begun. As of now, the harvesting has been completed in Guangdong, southern Guangxi, southern Jiangxi, Yunnan, and southern Fujian; the provinces in the Yangtze River Basin have entered a tense harvesting stage, and individual areas with later seasons will also enter the busiest harvesting period by the end of this month. Judging from the situation in various places, the early rice crop is generally better this year than last year.
    Some areas have experienced a prolonged spring harvest, delaying the transplanting of early rice seedlings, and the seedlings grew slowly due to excessive rain from the end of April to mid-May, resulting in a later early rice harvest than last year. Therefore, in order to transplant late rice seedlings before "Beginning of Autumn," it is necessary to do a good job in organizing the labor force and strive to complete the early rice harvest as soon as possible, without affecting the quality of the harvest.
    
    Strive for a Bumper Autumn Harvest
    Doing a good job in the field management of autumn crops has a decisive impact on striving for a bumper harvest this autumn. At present, in most areas of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, the progress of intertillage and hoeing is fast and timely, and hoeing will be completed around the end of this month; in the North China region, spring-sown crops have mostly been hoed three times, and some areas have been hoed four to five times, and earthing up is now in progress.
    However, since the beginning of the rainy season, some areas have suffered from disasters such as water, wind, and hail; pests such as corn borers, sorghum borers, millet borers, autumn locusts, and cotton bollworms have also occurred widely in various places; weed infestation has appeared in some areas, and summer manure accumulation work is still far from adequate. These situations indicate that in order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest, it is still necessary to further strengthen field management, fight against various disasters, and vigorously carry out manure accumulation work.

### 半月农情  小暑（7月7日）——大暑（7月23日）

    半月农情
    小暑（7月7日）——大暑（7月23日）
    在这半月内，各地农业生产的基本情况是：长江流域各省早稻收割进入紧张阶段，晚稻的栽插工作亦已开始；北方各省的春播作物生长茁壮，大部春玉米、春谷子和高粱等，已经打苞、抽穗、扬花；已播的夏种作物，一般出苗良好，现正开始间苗、追肥、除草；东北、西北各省的春小麦的收割工作，预计在8月中旬前后即可基本结束。目前，西北地区还有干旱现象，江西、福建、湖南、浙江、温州地区和广西部分地区亦呈现旱象；河南、山东、安徽、江苏等省不少地区最近因长期暴雨造成洪水和内涝灾害；以上地区的农民正大力开展抗旱和排涝工作。
    加紧收割早稻
    南方各省的一亿多亩单季和双季早稻，已经普遍成熟，并开镰收割。截至目前为止，广东、广西南部、江西赣南地区、云南和福建的南部已收割完毕，长江流域各省进入紧张的收割阶段，个别季节较迟的地区亦将于本月底进入收割的大忙时期。从各地情况看来，今年早稻一般比去年好。
    部分地区因春收作物收获期拖长，早稻秧苗插的晚了，加上4月底到5月中旬多雨，禾苗成长较慢，结果早稻收获期比去年要晚。因此，为了在“立秋”前能插下晚稻秧苗，就必须做好劳动力组织工作，在不影响收割质量的原则下，争取尽快完成早稻收割工作。
    争取大秋作物丰收
    做好大秋作物的田间管理工作，对争取今年秋季大丰收有决定性的影响。目前辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等地大部地区，中耕铲趟进度较快而及时，将在本月底前后挂锄；华北地区的春播作物，大部已锄过三遍，有的地区已锄了四至五遍，现正进行培土工作。
    但进入雨季以来，有些地区遭受了水、风、雹等灾害；玉米钻心虫、高粱螟虫、谷粘虫、秋蝗、棉花红铃虫等虫害又在各地普遍发生；部分地区出现草荒现象，夏季积肥工作开展的还很不够。这些情况说明，为了争取实现农业大丰收，还必须进一步加强田间管理，向各种灾害作斗争，并大力开展积肥工作。
