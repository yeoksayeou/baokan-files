We are all representatives of overseas Chinese, and we fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report on the socialist revolution, socialist construction, people's lives, the basic system of the country, and domestic and international unity, as well as the work reports of other department heads. In our enthusiastic discussions over the past few days, we unanimously believe that the achievements made by the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government in leading the people of the country to implement the First Five-Year Plan for national economic construction are in line with the wishes of the people. These reports correctly affirmed the achievements, summarized the experiences, and gave a relentless blow to the sabotage conspiracies of the bourgeois right-wing elements. These reports pointed out that our initial achievements have laid a good foundation for the country's Second Five-Year Plan. We would like to express our most sincere gratitude to the Party and the government.

    The Motherland's Leap Forward Emboldens Overseas Chinese

Like the people of the whole country, overseas Chinese are very concerned about the achievements made in the motherland's socialist construction. It can be said that every piece of victorious news about these achievements is the most important source of joy and encouragement for the 13 million overseas Chinese and the 10 million family members of overseas Chinese in the country. In particular, when we recall how low the international status of the motherland was before liberation, how the feudal warlords and comprador classes' reactionary governments only knew how to curry favor with the enemy, seeking glory and humiliating the country, and how our beautiful rivers and mountains became semi-colonies, the overseas Chinese were ashamed and indignant for a long time. Today, the People's Republic of China has leaped forward from a backward state and become capable of manufacturing jet planes, automobiles, precision instruments, and machine tools; building the great Yangtze River Bridge and the Yingxia Railway; our industrial construction speed is even recognized by the United Nations as the world's first; our international reputation shines brightly on the earth and is respected by people all over the world; the united 600 million people, together with the Soviet Union, have become a great fortress for defending world peace. We overseas Chinese feel proud of these honors and feel we can hold our heads high. Who should we thank? First of all, we must thank Chairman Mao and the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

    The Communist Party Has Given Us Strength and Confidence

We will not forget how terrible the destitute, poor, sad, and desperate situation of the working people of the motherland was before liberation. Every year, millions of people died of hunger and natural disasters; in 1943, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, more than 400,000 people were lost in Taishan and Chaoyang counties alone (the "Tomb of Ten Thousand People" in Chaoyang is a tragic memorial to the workers, peasants, and family members of overseas Chinese who were collectively buried because they starved to death); in Guangdong and Fujian provinces alone, 200,000 to 300,000 people had to abandon their parents, wives, and children to make a living overseas every year. Today, under the care and love of the Party and the government, the vast majority of the people have not only seen great improvements in their lives, but also feel the happiness of national rebirth and growth, and have seen the glory of a prosperous socialist society. The feelings of sadness and despair are gone forever, replaced by the confidence to move towards a prosperous and happy socialism. Who gave us this strength and confidence? Mainly only the Chinese Communist Party.

In the hometowns of overseas Chinese, Guangdong and Fujian provinces, bandits, despots, and "big sky twos" ran rampant before liberation, defying the law. Returning overseas Chinese naturally became their prey. The Chiang Kai-shek clique and local warlords regarded overseas Chinese as objects of extortion, deception, and blackmail. What was especially poisonous was their "big ocean coupons" and "gold round coupons," which cruelly exploited them, turning the years of hard work and sweat of thousands of overseas Chinese into nothing in an instant. Today, a peaceful world where doors are not closed at night has appeared in various overseas Chinese hometowns. Bandits, despots, big sky twos, and corrupt officials have been punished by the people. In particular, the value of the Renminbi has been tested for more than seven years, making the lives of overseas Chinese compatriots worry-free. These are all earth-shaking changes that we returned overseas Chinese have personally experienced. Without the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in our socialist reform and the people's democratic dictatorship, it would not have been possible.

    The Party and Government Show Meticulous Care for Overseas Chinese Persecuted Overseas

We overseas Chinese especially deeply appreciate the care of the Party and the government for overseas Chinese who have been persecuted overseas, which is no different from the love of parents for their children. In recent years, more than 20,000 refugees who have been forcibly deported from Malaya, Thailand, and other places have received warm reception, relief, and appropriate resettlement from the government. The government has allocated 20 to 30 million yuan in special funds to help these refugees. In contrast, when a group of overseas Chinese expelled from Malaya arrived in Shantou in 1948 when Guangdong was not yet liberated, they were detained in the Shi Paotai Prison by the Kuomintang reactionary government and subjected to inhumane extortion. Some of those who had no money to bribe were imprisoned until Shantou was liberated in 1949 before they were released. What a sharp contrast! Right-wing elements say the Communist Party is bad, but we overseas Chinese say the right-wing elements have lost all conscience.

Since liberation, thanks to the superior methods of school education in the motherland and under the call of patriotism, overseas Chinese have sent their children back to the country to study in large numbers, reaching 5,000 to 6,000 people every year (it is estimated that this year may increase to 7,000 to 8,000 people). To take care of the wishes of overseas Chinese, the government specially built three supplementary schools in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Xiamen, spending more than 10 million yuan in construction costs to receive these young people who have returned to their motherland from the five continents of the world, so that they feel the warmth and love of the Communist Party and the motherland government as soon as they arrive in the country.

    Overseas Chinese Love the Motherland and Will Always Follow the Communist Party

In the seven years since liberation, more than 300,000 overseas Chinese have returned to the country to visit their relatives, bringing back the love of overseas Chinese for the motherland. Countless overseas Chinese have built houses, schools, bridges, and roads in their hometowns and done various public welfare undertakings. They have established more than 20 overseas Chinese middle schools and many primary schools in Guangdong and Fujian provinces. In the past two years, they have built a picturesque overseas Chinese new village in Guangzhou. They have built thousands of new houses in more than 50 counties and cities in overseas Chinese hometowns. Every year, thousands of overseas Chinese from all walks of life come to major cities in the motherland to inspect industrial and cultural construction, and countless overseas Chinese remit their labor savings from overseas to invest in and support the motherland's socialist construction. They support the Party and the government with concrete actions and take pride in being able to do their best. The hypocrisy, honeyed words, and double-dealing tactics of the bourgeois right-wing elements in carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist activities can only be said to be insane compared with the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for the motherland!

The above facts show that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is precisely the source of happiness and joy for all the people of our country and the guarantee of our country's glorious and strong position. The Party is our great benefactor, and she is now and will be the leader of our country's construction, leading us from victory to victory until socialism is completed. We overseas Chinese will, together with the people of the whole country, always follow the Communist Party.

    Determined to Fight the Right-Wing Elements to the End

The Party is carrying out a rectification campaign against the "three evils" in order to better complete the tasks entrusted to it by the people, which is conducive to strengthening the Party's leadership and strengthening socialist construction. Right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, and Chen Mingshu took the opportunity to carry out heinous activities against the Party, against socialism, and even to undermine Sino-Soviet unity, which aroused our boundless indignation.

The Zhang-Luo alliance and other right-wing elements such as Huang Shaohong used the vile methods of inverting right and wrong and exaggerating shortcomings to describe the overall great achievements of the motherland's construction as a "complete mess," saying that the "Five-Year Plan has collapsed," the "suppression of counter-revolutionaries has collapsed," the "state purchase and marketing has collapsed," and "non-Party students have no future." In short, everything is "very dark." They sent right-wing pawns and reporters to universities and major cities to spread poison and set fires, saying, "If students take to the streets and intellectuals take the lead, the Communist Party will fall." At the same time, they wanted to avenge the "wrongs" and "hatreds" of counter-revolutionary elements, dreaming that the Hungarian October Incident could be repeated in China and that they could transform themselves into the Nagy group. This is clearly a full-fledged attempt at rebellion and revolt.

Zhang Naiqi emphasized that fixed interest is not exploitation, said that the bourgeoisie no longer has two sides, and incited the industrial and commercial circles to blur class lines and resist transformation. He openly demanded that the Communist Party organization and public representatives be driven out of joint state-private enterprises. The obvious purpose of these fallacies is to demand the restoration of capitalism in industrial and commercial enterprises. This is clearly a resistance to the articles in the Constitution regarding the leadership of the working class and socialist transformation.

Their fallacies, coupled with organized, programmatic, and division-of-labor actions, created a rampant attack on the people's democratic power. Their vicious rumors and shameless slanders, coupled with Long Yun's anti-Soviet fallacies, were praised by the United States and Taiwan. We overseas Chinese, together with the people of the whole country, will never allow their rampant rebellious behavior. We overseas Chinese representatives have received a joint notice from the Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal Overseas Chinese Federations, demanding that the National People's Congress thoroughly crack down on all the poisonous attempts of the right-wing elements. If they do not thoroughly repent and honestly confess their crimes, they will be severely punished by law.

We are determined to fully fight against the right-wing elements. At the same time, all returned overseas Chinese and family members of overseas Chinese are determined to draw a clear line with the right-wing elements politically and ideologically, and will always unite around the Communist Party and advance along the road of socialism together with the people of the whole country.

    华侨坚决拥护社会主义制度
    蚁美厚、苏振寿、周  铮、伍  禅、谢应瑞、马玉声、吴桓兴、吴益修、廖胜、方君壮的联合发言
    我们都是华侨代表，我们完全同意周总理在政府工作报告中所谈的关于社会主义革命、关于社会主义建设、关于人民生活、关于国家的基本制度和关于国内外团结等问题的全部内容，并完全同意其他各部门首长的工作报告。我们在连日的热烈讨论当中，一致认为中国共产党和中央人民政府在领导全国人民执行国民经济建设第一个五年计划所取得的成就是符合人民的愿望的。这些报告正确地肯定了成绩，总结了经验，并给资产阶级右派分子的破坏阴谋以无情痛击，这些报告指出我们的初步成就已经为祖国第二个五年计划奠定了良好的基础。我们谨向党和政府表示最衷诚的感谢。
    祖国飞跃前进  华侨扬眉吐气
    和全国人民一样，华侨对祖国社会主义建设所取得的成就，是非常关心的。可以这样说，这些成就的每一项胜利消息，都是使国外一千三百万华侨和国内一千万华侨家属欢欣鼓舞的最重要源泉。特别是当我们回忆到解放前祖国国际地位何等低落，封建军阀和买办阶级的反动政府只知媚敌求荣，丧权辱国，我们的锦绣河山，变为半殖民地，海外华侨长期蒙垢怀惭，悲愤填膺。今天，中华人民共和国已经从落后的状态飞跃前进，变为能够自己制造喷气飞机、汽车、精密仪器、工作母机；自己建筑了伟大的长江大桥和鹰厦铁路；我们的工业建设速度甚至联合国也不得不公认为世界第一；我们的国际荣誉在地球上放出万丈光芒，受到全世界人民异口同声的钦敬；团结一致的六亿人民和苏联在一起，已经成为保卫世界和平的伟大堡垒。我们华侨因为有了这些光荣而感到可以扬眉吐气，我们要感谢谁？首先要感谢毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导。
    共产党给了我们力量和信心
    我们不会忘记，解放前祖国劳动人民的颠沛穷苦、悲哀绝望情况，是何等的可怖，全国每年经常有几百万人死于饥饿和自然灾害；一九四三年抗战时期仅台山、潮阳两县就丧失人口四十多万人（现在潮阳的“万人坟”，就是当时集体抛埋饿死的工人农民和华侨家属的悲惨纪念）；仅广东、福建两省，每年经常有二三十万人口必须抛弃父母妻儿到外洋去谋生。今天，则绝大多数人民在党和政府的关怀爱护之下，不但生活有了大大的改善，并且都感到民族新生和壮大的幸福，都看到美满繁荣的社会主义社会的光辉，悲哀绝望的情绪已一去不回了，代之的是满怀信心的走向繁荣幸福的社会主义，谁给我们这些力量和信心？主要只有中国共产党。
    我们华侨家乡广东和福建两省，解放前土匪、恶霸、“大天二”横行霸道，无法无天，归国华侨天然成为他们的俎上肉。蒋介石集团和地方军阀，更把华侨看做是他们巧取豪夺、欺骗勒索的对象。尤其毒恶的是他们的“大洋券”、“金圆券”的残酷剥削，使千千万万华侨积年累月的劳动血汗，顷刻化为乌有。今天，各地侨乡已经出现了夜不闭户的升平世界；土匪、恶霸、大天二和贪官污吏都受到人民的惩罚；尤其是人民币价值已经经过了七年多来的考验，使侨胞生活无忧无虑。这些都是我们归国华侨亲身体会到的翻天复地的变化。没有中国共产党领导我们的社会主义改革和人民民主专政是不可能有的。
    党和政府对海外受到迫害的华侨爱护备至
    我们华侨尤其深刻体会到党和政府对在海外受迫害的华侨的爱护，和亲生父母爱护自己的儿女没有两样。近年来从马来亚、泰国等地被强制出境的难侨，前后达二万多人，他们都得到政府的殷勤接待救济和适当安置。为了救济这些难侨，政府拨给专款已达二三千万元。相反，当一九四八年广东未解放时，一批由马来亚被驱逐出境的华侨，到达汕头时竟被国民党反动政府押入石炮台监狱，惨无人道的进行勒索敲诈，其中一部分无钱可贿赂的，竟被禁押到一九四九年汕头解放时才得到自由。这是何等尖锐的对比！右派分子说共产党不好，我们华侨说右派分子是丧尽天良。
    解放后由于祖国学校教育方法优越，海外华侨在爱国主义号召下，纷纷送儿女回国就学，每年达五六千人（今年估计可能增至七八千人），祖国政府照顾华侨的愿望，特地在广州、北京、厦门三个城市建筑了三个补习学校，用去建筑费已达一千多万元，来接待这些从世界五大洲回到自己的祖国怀抱的青年，使他们一抵国门就感到共产党和祖国政府的温暖慈爱。
    华侨热爱祖国，永远跟着共产党走
    解放后七年多以来，华侨回国省亲已达三十多万人，他们都带回了侨胞对祖国的热爱，无数华侨在家乡建房屋、办学校、造桥修路，做种种公益事业。他们在广东、福建两省已经办了二十多个华侨中学和许多小学。最近二年来，他们在广州建筑了一个美丽如画的华侨新村。他们在侨乡五十多个县市建筑了数以千计的新住宅。每年有数以千计的华侨各阶层人士到祖国各大城市考察工业建设和文化建设，还有无数华侨把他们的劳动积蓄从海外汇回来投资支持祖国的社会主义建设。他们用具体行动来支持党和政府，并以能够如此尽力为自身的光荣。资产阶级右派分子的口是心非，口蜜腹剑，耍两面派手段来进行反党反社会主义活动，和华侨对祖国的热情相比，只能说他们右派分子是丧心病狂！
    以上事实说明中国共产党的领导正是我们全国人民的幸福和快乐的泉源，是我们国家光荣强大地位的保证；党正是我们的大恩人，她现在是、将来也将是我们国家建设的领导者，她正引导我们从胜利走向胜利，直到社会主义完成。我们华侨将和全国人民一道，永远跟着共产党走。
    决心同右派分子斗争到底
    党为了更好地完成人民所付托的任务而进行反“三害”的整风，这是有利于加强党的领导作用和加强社会主义建设的。右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平、龙云、黄绍竑、陈铭枢等则乘机进行反党、反社会主义、甚至破坏中苏团结的罪恶活动，引起了我们无比的愤恨。
    章、罗联盟以及黄绍竑等右派分子利用颠倒是非、夸大缺点的恶劣手法，把祖国建设的全面伟大成就描写为“一团糟”，说什么“五年计划搞垮了”、“肃反搞垮了”、“统购统销搞垮了”、“非党员学生无前途”，总之，甚么都是“黑暗得很”。他们派出右派爪牙和记者到各大学、各大城市去放毒放火，他们说“学生上街，知识分子带头，共产党就会倒台”，同时他们要为反革命分子有“冤”报冤，有“仇”报仇，梦想匈牙利十月事件可以在中国重演，自己化身为纳吉集团，这明明是十足不扣的叛乱造反企图。
    章乃器强调定息不是剥削，说资产阶级已经没有两面性，蛊惑工商界模糊阶级界线和抗拒改造，公然要求把共产党组织和公方代表赶出公私合营企业，这些谬论的明显目的就是要求资本主义在工商企业中复辟。这显然是对宪法中关于工人阶级领导和社会主义改造等条文的反抗。
    他们的谬论配合着有组织、有纲领、有分工的行动，造成对人民民主政权的猖狂进攻。他们的恶毒造谣、无耻诬蔑、配合着龙云的反苏谬论，得到了美国和台湾的赞美，我们华侨和全国人民一道绝不容许他们的猖狂造反行为。我们华侨代表已经接到广东省和广州市的归国华侨联合会的联合通知，要求全国人民代表大会彻底打击右派分子的一切恶毒企图，如果他们不彻底悔罪，坦白交代出他们的罪恶，就要严厉予以法律制裁。
    我们决心全力地对右派分子进行全面斗争，同时全体归国华侨和华侨家属坚决在政治上和思想上与右派分子划清界线，永远团结在共产党的周围，与全国人民一道，向社会主义的道路前进。
