    Rambling on the Film "The Fugitive"
  　Shen Jiyu
    French writer Michel André, based on his personal experiences during World War II, wrote the novella "One Evening"; later, he collaborated with René Clément, the director of the film "Lost in Paris," to adapt the novella into the film "The Fugitive."
    "The Fugitive," in a suspenseful style, portrays the adventurous journey of three people who escaped from a German concentration camp, presenting us with a series of thrilling scenes: the fugitives mistakenly enter a flak battery in the forest and are repeatedly questioned by German sentries; to avoid railway patrolmen, they have to lie down between the tracks and let the train rumble over them... Many rapidly unfolding plots lead us into a very thrilling and critical state, and also prompt us to be more concerned and suspenseful about the fugitives' encounters and fate. And these thrilling plots are not highlighted for superficial effects; they are closely related to the central idea of the entire film, and make this central idea clearer: the friendship and solidarity generated among the fugitives in adversity, as well as the people's help and support for them, are important factors in defeating the enemy and overcoming difficulties.
    Although the story of the film is very simple, and a considerable portion of it depicts the activities of the fugitives in a carriage, it does not feel lengthy or dull at all, because the filmmakers and actors have a good grasp of the characters' rich and complex mental states, and portray the characters' different personalities.
    From the views and handling of many issues, we can clearly see that the social experiences and political views of the three fugitives are different. For example, on the view of "freedom," some are prepared to continue the struggle after escaping the clutches of the enemy, while others are willing to return home and live a stable life. Also, for example, the problem of "water," the water they store is getting less and less, and thirst threatens them. At this time, Pierre and Michel always try their best to restrain themselves, holding the spirit of sharing the same boat, enduring the pain and overcoming the difficulties; however, François always wants to drink more water, snatch water, and even steal water. Here, isn't his selfish weakness exposed? Later, François realized that his approach was very bad, and decided to correct it, and volunteered to get off the train to fetch water. This courageous action shows that they have gained mutual trust, and their friendship is more consolidated. The development of the plot has also taken a big step forward at this point.
    It is worth mentioning that when the film expresses the activities of the fugitives in the carriage, it links it with the external environment. For example, when they still have a small amount of drinking water, other women and children who were kidnapped by the German bandits are desperately calling for "water...water" because of thirst; after they have no water, a German soldier opens a roadside tap and continuously releases water; as well as the activities of the German soldiers at various stations seen through the eyes of the fugitives, and so on. In this way, the scenes depicted in the film are wider and more realistic.
    The ending of the film is meaningful. The three fugitives face the vast sea, looking at their distant motherland, with a common new wish: "Peaceful happiness, like our freedom today, must be obtained by our joint efforts!" Such an idea goes far beyond the scope of the story told by "The Fugitive," and arouses our deep thinking about the significance of current life and struggle.

    漫谈影片“逃亡者”
  　沈基宇
    法国作家米歇尔·安德烈根据第二次世界大战期间亲身的经历，写成了中篇小说“某一天晚上”；后来，他又和影片“没有留下地址”的导演勒·夏诺阿合作，把小说改编成影片“逃亡者”。
    “逃亡者”以惊险样式表现了三个从德国集中营逃亡出来的人的历险过程，在我们面前展现出一幅幅惊心动魄的情景：逃亡者们误入树林里的高射炮阵地，受到了德国哨兵的再三盘问；为了躲避铁路上的巡逻兵，他们不得不卧倒在轨道中间，让火车隆隆地从他们身上驶过……许多急剧展开的情节，把我们带入非常惊险和危急的境界之中，也促使我们对于逃亡者的遭遇和命运的愈益关切和悬念。而这些惊险情节也并不是为了追求表面效果而突出的，它和整个影片的中心思想有着密切的联系，并且使这个中心思想更加明确了：逃亡者在患难中产生的友谊和团结力量，以及人民对他们的帮助和支持，是战胜敌人和克服困难的重要因素。
    虽然影片的故事很简单，而且其中有相当长一段戏是描写逃亡者在一节车厢中的活动的；但是由于摄制者和演员很好地把握住了人物的丰富而复杂的精神状态，刻划出了人物各自不同的性格，因此使人丝毫不感到冗长、沉闷。
    从对许多问题的看法和处理上，我们可以清楚地看出三个逃亡者的社会经历和政治见解都是各不相同的。譬如对于“自由”的看法吧，有人准备逃出敌人的魔掌后继续坚持斗争，有人却愿意回到家中安安稳稳地过日子。又譬如“水”的问题吧，他们存储的水越来越少了，干渴威胁着他们。这时候彼埃尔和米歇尔总是尽力克制着自己，抱着同舟共济的精神，忍受着痛苦，克服困难；然而弗朗沙阿却总是想多喝水，抢水喝，甚至偷水喝，在这里，他自私自利的弱点不是就暴露无遗了么？后来，弗朗沙阿认识到自己的作法很不好，决心改正，并自告奋勇下车去打水，这种勇敢的行动，说明他们之间已经取得相互的信任，他们的友谊更加巩固了。故事情节的发展至此也向前跃进了一大步。
    值得提出的是影片在表现逃亡者在车厢中的活动时，把它和外界环境联系起来了。例如当他们还有少量供饮用的水时，另外一些被德寇劫走的妇女和孩子却因干渴而拼命叫“水……水”；他们没有水了以后，一个德国兵去打开路旁的一个水龙头不停地哗哗地放水；以及通过逃亡者们的眼睛，看到的各个车站的德国兵的活动等等。这样一来，影片所表现的场景就更为广阔和真实些。
    影片的结尾是含意深长的。三个逃亡者对着辽阔的海面，遥望着远方的祖国，怀着一个共同的新的愿望：“和平的幸福，就像我们今天的自由一样，必须我们合力争取才能得到！”这样的思想，更远远超过了“逃亡者”所叙述的故事范围，而引起我们对于当前生活和斗争的意义的深深的思考。
