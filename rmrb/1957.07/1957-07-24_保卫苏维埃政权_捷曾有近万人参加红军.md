    Defending the Soviet Regime
    Nearly 10,000 Czechs Participated in the Red Army
    Czechoslovak historians are studying the activities of Czechoslovak progressive forces during the Russian Revolution of 1917. Part of the results of this work will be compiled into a book to be published this year. According to existing materials, nearly 10,000 Czechs and Slovaks participated in the Red Army after the October Revolution. Czech and Slovak social democratic organizations were established in Kiev after the February Revolution in 1917. After the Great October Socialist Revolution, at the initiative of the Czech and Slovak left-wing social democratic organizations, some Red Army combat units composed of Czechs and Slovaks were established. By the end of May 1918, these combat units were led by Czechoslovak Communists.

    The Czechoslovak Red Army troops were an important combat force in the International Detachment of the Fifth Army of the Soviet Red Army at that time. It fought on three fronts where the Entente invading forces launched attacks, and powerfully assisted the Red Army in stopping the anti-Soviet riots of the former Czech White Guard Corps.

    保卫苏维埃政权
    捷曾有近万人参加红军
    捷克斯洛伐克历史学家们正在研究捷克斯洛伐克进步力量在1917年俄国革命期间的活动情况。这项工作的一部分成果将编成著作在今年内出版。根据现有的材料表明，曾经有近一万名捷克人和斯洛伐克人在十月革命以后参加了红军。捷克和斯洛伐克的社会民主组织在1917年二月革命以后就在当时的基辅成立起来了。伟大的十月社会主义革命以后，在捷克和斯洛伐克左翼社会民主组织的创议之下，建立了一些由捷克人和斯洛伐克人组成的红军战斗单位。到1918年5月底时，这些战斗单位就由捷克斯洛伐克共产党人领导了。
    在当时苏维埃红军第五军的国际支队中，捷克斯洛伐克红军部队曾是一支重要的战斗力量。它在协约国侵略军队发动进攻的三条战线上都曾进行过战斗，并且有力地协助红军制止了前捷克白卫军团的反苏暴动。
