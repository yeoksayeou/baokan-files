Production Teams Must Also Publicize Finances

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Zhejiang Daily, all production teams of the Wusi Agricultural Cooperative in Wuyi Township, Zhuji County, are able to clear their accounts daily, make monthly settlements, and publicize their finances on time, which is highly appreciated by the cooperative members.

    The Wusi Cooperative has eighteen production teams, equipped with twenty-three bookkeepers. Fifteen of them already have two years of bookkeeping experience, while the other eight are newcomers. Thanks to the cooperative's assistance, the bookkeepers' work has greatly improved, and now most small teams can clear their accounts daily and make monthly settlements.

    The methods used by this cooperative to improve the bookkeepers' professional skills include not only centralized training, but also the dispatch of accountants to the small teams to provide guidance to the bookkeepers. In addition, mutual learning among the bookkeepers is also an important way to improve their professional skills.

    The Zhejiang Daily published a short commentary on this, saying: In the work of implementing financial transparency, agricultural cooperatives in various places pay more attention to publicizing the finances of the entire cooperative, and less attention to publicizing the finances of the production teams. Therefore, some cooperative members are still not satisfied, saying: "The accounts of the team are not clear, and the publicity of the cooperative's finances is of little use."

    The commentary pointed out: After the implementation of the separation of powers between the cooperative and the team, the accounts of the production team are much more complicated than in the past. Now the team not only has to keep labor work point accounts, but also product income and expenditure registration accounts, and also carry out its own income distribution, etc. These many financial accounts are of the greatest concern to the cooperative members, especially labor work point accounts and advance payment accounts, etc., which are directly related to the interests of the cooperative members. If there is a problem with these accounts, it will cause dissatisfaction among the cooperative members. At the same time, in order to sort out the finances of the entire cooperative and make them public on time, the first step is to sort out and publicize the finances of the production teams.

    However, the biggest difficulty in publicizing the finances of the production teams is that the bookkeepers have low professional skills and cannot undertake the financial work of the production teams. Therefore, it is very necessary to improve the bookkeepers' professional skills.

### 生产队也要公开财政

    生产队也要公开财政
    本报讯　据浙江日报消息：诸暨县五一乡五四农业社所有生产队的账目都能够做到日清月结，按时公布，社员非常满意。
    五四社十八个生产队，配有记账员二十三人，除十五个已有二年的记账经验外，其他八个都是新手。由于合作社对他们的帮助，记账员的工作有了很大的提高，现在一般小队都能做到账目日清月结。
    这个社提高记账员业务水平的方法，除了集中训练以外，主要是由会计员深入到小队去对记账员进行辅导。此外，记账员之间相互学习，也是提高业务水平的重要办法。
    浙江日报为此发表短评说：各地农业社在实行财政公开的工作中，比较注意公开全社性的财政，不大注意公开生产队的财政。因此，有些社员仍旧不够满意，他们说：队里的账目不清楚，社里的财政公开了也没有多大用处。
    短评指出：实行社、队分权以后，生产队里的账目比过去复杂得多了。现在队里不仅要记劳动工分账，还有产品的收支登记账，还要搞生产队自己的收益分配等等。这许多财务账目是社员最关心的，尤其是劳动工分账和预支账等等，直接关系到社员的利益，这些账目如果有毛病，就会引起社员的不满。同时，要想把全社性的财政清理好，并且做到按时公开，首先就要清理和公开生产队的财政。
    但是生产队公开财政的最大困难是，记账员业务水平低，不能担负生产队的财务工作。因此提高记账员业务水平是十分必要的。
