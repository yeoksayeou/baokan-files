The National People's Congress representatives Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Yuan Xuefen, Chang Xiangyu, Chen Shufang, and Lang Xianfen submitted written opinions to the opera community on the 21st of this month, demanding the improvement of the ideological and artistic quality of opera, the performance of more excellent dramas with educational significance, and the avoidance of performing ugly, obscene, terrifying, and harmful dramas that damage the physical and mental health of the people. This is a timely and important call, and we hope that the national opera community will actively respond to and support it.

As their opinion stated, since the Ministry of Culture opened up twenty-six previously banned dramas, noteworthy new situations have emerged in the opera community. On the one hand, due to the elimination of "restrictive rules" that were unfavorable to the development of opera art, the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of artists have been further enhanced, and the opera stages in various regions have presented a lively new atmosphere. But on the other hand, some troupes that lack a sense of responsibility for the people's art have released a lot of "poisonous weeds," such as "Killing Son for Revenge," and in some cities, there has even been a phenomenon of several troupes "competing to release poisonous weeds," which has aroused criticism from many audiences and dissatisfaction from many respected opera artists. This criticism and dissatisfaction are justified. Opera art is an art with broad mass appeal, influencing the thoughts and feelings of tens of thousands of viewers every day. If we do not pay attention to the ideological and artistic nature of the repertoire and randomly release "poisonous weeds," it is a step backward. This is certainly not the original intention of the Ministry of Culture in opening up the repertoire.

One of the important reasons for this deviation is the misunderstanding of the meaning of "opening up the repertoire." "Opening up the repertoire" is one of the specific measures to improve leadership methods in the new situation, creating a more favorable atmosphere for the smooth development of opera work. In the past seven or eight years, under the guidance of the correct policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," the excavation of opera repertoire and the reform of opera have achieved great success and rich experience, and the political and ideological level of opera artists and the vast number of audiences have also been improved. The new situation requires new leadership methods, and it is already possible to hand over the decision-making power of performing repertoire to the troupes. Through the research and discussion of artists, through the supervision of the audience and social criticism, it is entirely possible to determine which plays should be put on the stage, and how to criticize and fight against harmful plays if they are put on the stage. Chairman Mao said in his report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "It is of course not right to fail to criticize, to watch erroneous ideas spread unchecked, and to allow them to occupy the market. Errors must be criticized and poisonous weeds must be fought against. ... We must learn together with the masses to carefully distinguish between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and together use correct methods to fight against poisonous weeds." This is the attitude we should take towards bad plays that poison the people, and it is also the attitude we should take towards all poisonous weeds.

On the one hand, national opera troupes and artists must adhere to the policy of boldly releasing repertoire, and on the other hand, they must treat the performing repertoire with a responsible attitude. Which repertoires can be moved to the stage unchanged, which repertoires must be appropriately modified, and which repertoires have no conditions for modification must be carefully studied and discussed. The performance repertoire should strive to be broad and diverse, not only cherishing repertoires with high ideological and artistic value, but also cherishing all repertoires that are relatively healthy in content and can give the audience aesthetic enjoyment, and even for some repertoires that are not easy to distinguish between good and bad for a while, they should not be easily rejected, and the audience and social commentary can be used to make appraisals. However, if a repertoire that is obviously harmful to the audience and has no conditions for modification is put on the stage, it must of course be severely criticized. It is wrong to take a laissez-faire attitude towards the performance of bad plays, which is a manifestation of a right-leaning viewpoint.

Judging from the opera repertoires that have already been performed, the vast majority are good, beneficial to the audience, and welcomed by the audience. After all, the "poisonous weeds" that have aroused a lot of audience resentment are in the minority. China's opera heritage is so rich that we can certainly continue to excavate and sort out many performable repertoires. Therefore, taking a prudent attitude towards the performance repertoire will not only not reduce the richness and variety of the performance repertoire, but also continuously improve the quality of opera performances.

### 有毒草就得进行斗争

    有毒草就得进行斗争
    全国人民代表大会代表梅兰芳、周信芳、程砚秋、袁雪芬、常香玉、陈书舫和郎咸芬，在本月21日向戏曲界提出书面意见，要求提高戏曲的思想质量和艺术质量，多演有教育意义的优秀剧目，不演丑恶、淫猥、恐怖、有害人民身心健康的坏戏。这是切合时宜的重要号召，我们希望全国戏曲界积极加以响应和支持。
    正如他们的意见书所说，自从文化部开放二十六个停演剧目以来，戏曲界出现了值得注意的新情况。在一方面，由于不利于戏曲艺术发展的“清规戒律”的消除，广大艺人的积极性和创造性更为提高，各地戏曲舞台呈现了活跃的新气象。但在另一方面，也有一些对人民艺术事业缺乏责任心的剧团放出了不少“毒草”，如“杀子报”之类，有些城市甚至出现了好几个剧团“竞放毒草”的现象，引起了很多观众的指责，也引起了不少有声望的戏曲艺人的不满。这种指责和不满是正当的。戏曲艺术是富有广泛群众性的艺术，每天影响着成千成万观众的思想感情。若不注意剧目的思想性和艺术性，乱放“毒草”，那就是开倒车了。这当然不是文化部开放剧目的本意。
    产生这种偏向的重要原因之一，是对于“开放剧目”的意义的误解。“开放剧目”是在新情况下改进领导方法的具体措施之一，为戏曲工作的顺利发展创造更有利的气氛。七、八年来，在“百花齐放，推陈出新”的正确方针的指导下，戏曲剧目的挖掘和戏曲改革工作都取得了巨大的成绩和丰富的经验，戏曲艺人和广大观众的政治水平和思想水平也都有所提高。新的情况要求新的领导方法，已经可以把上演剧目的决定权交给剧团。通过艺人的研究和讨论，通过观众的监督和社会的批评，完全可以确定哪些戏应该搬上舞台，而哪些有害的戏如果搬上舞台，应该怎样去进行批判和斗争。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告中说：“不加批评，看着错误思想到处泛滥，任凭它们去占领市场，当然不行。有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。……我们要同群众一起来学会谨慎地辨别香花和毒草，并且一起来用正确的方法同毒草作斗争。”这是我们对待毒害人民的坏戏所应取的态度，也是我们对待一切毒草所应取的态度。
    全国戏曲剧团和艺人一方面必须坚持大胆放手挖掘剧目的方针，另一方面又必须以认真负责的态度对待上演剧目。哪些剧目可以原封不动地搬上舞台，哪些剧目必须加以适当修改，哪些剧目没有修改条件，都要认真研究和讨论。演出剧目应该力求广泛、多样，不但要珍重有高度思想性和艺术性的剧目，而且要珍重一切内容比较健康而又能给予观众以美感享受的剧目，甚至对某些一时不易辨别好坏的剧目，也不应该轻易地加以否定，可以让观众和社会评论来作鉴定。但是显然对观众有害无益、又没有修改条件的剧目，如果搬上了舞台，当然必须加以严正的批判。对于坏戏的上演采取听其自然的态度是错误的，那是一种右倾观点的表现。
    从已经演出的戏曲剧目看来，绝大部分都是好的，对观众有益，受观众欢迎的，引起许多观众反感的“毒草”毕竟占少数。我国戏曲遗产是那样丰富，一定还可以继续挖掘、整理出不少可演的剧目来。所以对演出剧目采取审慎态度，非但不会减损演出剧目的丰富多采，而且能够不断提高戏曲演出的质量。
