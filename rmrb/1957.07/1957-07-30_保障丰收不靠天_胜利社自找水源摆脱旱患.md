    Guaranteeing a Bumper Harvest Without Relying on Heaven
    Victory Cooperative Finds its Own Water Source, Overcoming Drought
    This year, Yining County in Xinjiang has experienced scarce rainfall, and some crops are suffering from drought. The Victory Cooperative's management committee, believing they cannot rely on heaven for water, dispatched a water-finding team of twenty-seven young and strong cooperative members to the mountains to search for exploitable water sources. After five days of searching, digging, and dredging in the mountains, they finally found more than 150 springs, which can irrigate approximately 2,000 mu of land.

    保障丰收不靠天
    胜利社自找水源摆脱旱患
    新疆伊宁县今年雨量稀少，部分庄稼受旱。胜利社社管委会认为不能靠天等水，就派二十七个青壮年社员组成找水队，上山去寻找可加利用的水源，他们在山上经过了五天的寻找，挖掘和疏浚，终于找到了一百五十多个泉眼，约可灌溉两千多亩土地。
