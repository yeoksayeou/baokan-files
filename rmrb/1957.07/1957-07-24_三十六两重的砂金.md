Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 22nd: A natural gold nugget weighing thirty-six taels has recently been discovered at the famous Wulaga Gold Mine in Jiayin County, Heilongjiang Province. This natural gold nugget is the heaviest one discovered in Heilongjiang Province since liberation. In 1950, two natural gold nuggets weighing twenty-eight taels and twenty-two taels respectively were discovered in the Huma Gold Mine. According to veteran gold mine workers, this natural gold nugget is about 80-90% pure and can be refined into twenty-four to twenty-eight taels of pure gold, which is equivalent to the production of more than one hundred gold miners in a day. Calculated at the state purchase price, it is worth more than 3,000 yuan. Now, this natural gold nugget has been purchased by the Provincial Department of Industry and is displayed in the Provincial Local Industrial Products Exhibition Hall.

    三十六两重的砂金
    新华社哈尔滨22日电  黑龙江省嘉荫县著名的靰鞡嘎金矿，最近发现一块三十六两重的自然砂金。这块自然砂金是黑龙江省在解放后发现的自然砂金中最重的一块。1950年在呼玛金矿曾发现过二十八两和二十二两重的两块自然砂金。这块自然砂金经金矿老工人鉴定，纯度约有八、九成，可提炼出纯金二十四两到二十八两，等于一百多名采金工人一天的生产量。按国家收购价格计算，可值三千多元。现在，这块自然砂金经省工业厅收购后，已陈列在省地方工业产品展览馆中。
