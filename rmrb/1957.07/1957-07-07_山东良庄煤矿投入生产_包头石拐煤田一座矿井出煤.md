    Shandong Liangzhuang Coal Mine Goes into Production
    A Mine in the Shig拐 Coalfield of Baotou Starts Coal Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th – The newly built Shandong Liangzhuang Coal Mine officially went into production on the 1st.
    This mine is located in central Shandong Province, and the Cinnan branch line of the Jinpu Railway provides direct access to the mining site. The coal deposits here are abundant and of good quality, suitable for transportation, power industry, and domestic use. The construction of this coal mine began in September 1954. It was designed according to the latest Soviet standards, and the entire production process, from underground mining to loading onto trains on the surface, has basically eliminated heavy manual labor.
    After inspection and trial operation, the project quality of this mine meets the standards stipulated by the state. After it goes into production, it can produce 300,000 tons of coal annually, and the designed maximum annual output reaches 450,000 tons.
    Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 5th – A modern mine in the Shig拐 Coalfield near Baotou went into production on the 1st. This mine can produce 300,000 tons of coking coal per year.
    The Shig拐 Coalfield is the coking coal base of Inner Mongolia. The coal produced here will be supplied to the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex in large quantities. Two other newly built modern vertical shafts, each with an annual output of 600,000 tons, are under intense construction in this coalfield.
    The mine that went into production on July 1st has a mostly mechanized production process. In order to transport the large amount of coal produced by this mine to Baotou and various parts of Inner Mongolia, the railway line from Baotou to the mining area has been opened to traffic.

    山东良庄煤矿投入生产
    包头石拐煤田一座矿井出煤
    新华社济南5日电　新建山东良庄煤矿在1日正式投入生产。
    这个矿井位于山东省中部，由津浦铁路的磁南支线可以直通采煤现场。这里煤藏丰富，质地良好，可供交通运输、电力工业和生活需用。这个煤矿从1954年9月开始建井，是按照苏联最新标准设计的，从井下采煤到地面装入火车，整个生产过程基本上消除了笨重的体力劳动。
    这个矿井经过检查和试运转，工程质量合乎国家规定的标准。它投入生产以后，每年可产煤三十万吨，设计最高年产量达四十五万吨。
    新华社包头5日电　在包头附近的石拐煤田一座现代化的矿井1日投入生产。这座矿井一年可以生产三十万吨炼焦煤。
    石拐煤田是内蒙古的炼焦煤基地。这里生产的煤，将大量供应包头钢铁联合企业。另外两座新建的年产各六十万吨的现代化竖井，正在这个煤田上紧张地进行建设。
    7月1日投入生产的这座矿井，绝大部分生产过程是机械化的。为了把这个矿井生产的大量煤炭运到包头和内蒙古各地，从包头通往矿区的铁路线已经通车。
