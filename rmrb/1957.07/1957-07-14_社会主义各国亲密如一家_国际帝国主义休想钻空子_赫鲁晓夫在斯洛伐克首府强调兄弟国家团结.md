Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 13th: The Soviet Communist Party and government delegation visited Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, on July 12th.

The delegation visited one of the largest scientific research institutions here, the Welding Research Institute, attended a reception jointly held by the Central Committee of the Slovak Communist Party, the Slovak Administrative Committee, and the Slovak National Assembly, and laid a wreath at the tomb of Soviet soldiers on Slavín Hill in the afternoon.

Khrushchev, Bulganin, and other members of the Soviet delegation attended a mass rally on Gottwald Square.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Slovak Communist Party, Bačílek, addressed the gathering of 120,000 people, welcoming the distinguished guests, saying that without the Soviet Union, there would be no freedom for us, and no path for us to socialism. Therefore, we will always be loyal to Gottwald's slogan: "Trust and friendship with the Soviet Union will always be the touchstone of Czechoslovak socialist patriotism." Bačílek said that international imperialism is trying to undermine the unity of the socialist camp, and trying to separate the people's democratic countries from the center of the international workers' movement and the fortress of peace - the great Soviet Union. We always resolutely and consistently rebuff these enemy conspiracies with closer unity with the Soviet Union and closer relations with it.

Next, Khrushchev spoke. He said that your achievements, like the achievements of all socialist countries, make the imperialists uneasy. They are doing their best to harm our countries. However, as long as the countries of the socialist camp get along like a friendly and united family, their despicable tricks will not succeed.

The relations between socialist countries are based on the principles of complete equality, mutual assistance, and comprehensive cooperation. This relationship has particularly effectively helped our countries to advance rapidly in the cause of building a new society, and to overcome economic and other difficulties more easily. This is the reason why we are strong, and why we are invincible.

Khrushchev said that some people in Western countries are not interested in easing international tensions and are trying to entangle the issue of disarmament with the issue of German reunification. The purpose of handling the issue in this way is to undermine disarmament work, because the issue of general disarmament and the issue of German reunification are two completely different issues.

Khrushchev then said that the Soviet Union is pursuing Lenin's policy of peace diplomacy, and the Soviet Union is acting in accordance with the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. The Soviet Union will unswervingly strive to consolidate peace and ensure the safety of all peoples.

    社会主义各国亲密如一家  国际帝国主义休想钻空子
    赫鲁晓夫在斯洛伐克首府强调兄弟国家团结
    据新华社布拉格13日电　苏联共产党和政府代表团7月12日在斯洛伐克首府布拉迪斯拉发参观访问。
    代表团参观了这里最大的科学研究机构之一——焊接研究所，出席了斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会、斯洛伐克行政委员会和斯洛伐克民族议会联合举行的招待会，并且在下午到斯拉文斯克山上的苏军战士墓前献了花圈。
    赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁和苏联代表团其他人员在哥特瓦尔德广场参加群众欢迎大会。
    斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记巴契列克在这个有十二万群众参加的集会上致词，欢迎贵宾们说，没有苏联，就没有我们的自由，也没有我们走向社会主义的道路。因此，我们将永远忠于哥特瓦尔德的口号：“对苏联的信任和友谊永远是捷克斯洛伐克社会主义爱国主义的试金石”。巴契列克说，国际帝国主义力图破坏社会主义阵营的团结，力图把人民民主国家同国际工人运动的中心和和平堡垒——伟大的苏联分割开来。我们总是以同苏联更加紧密的团结和对它更加亲密的关系坚决一致地回击敌人的这些阴谋。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫讲话。他说，你们取得的成就同一切社会主义国家取得的成就一样，使帝国主义者感到惶惶不安。他们竭力想害我们这些国家。但是，只要社会主义阵营的国家相处得像一个友好团结的大家庭，他们的卑鄙的勾当就无法得逞。
    社会主义国家之间的关系是建立在完全平等、互助和全面合作这些原则的基础上的。这种关系特别有效地帮助了我们这些国家在建设新社会的事业上迅速前进，更易于克服经济方面和其他方面的困难。我们之所以有力量，我们之所以不可战胜，就是由于这个原因。
    赫鲁晓夫说，一些西方国家人士对缓和国际紧张局势不感兴趣，竭力把裁军问题同统一德国问题纠缠在一起。这样处理问题，其目的就是想破坏裁军工作，因为，普遍裁军问题和统一德国问题，这是截然不同的两个问题。
    赫鲁晓夫随后说，苏联执行列宁的和平外交政策，苏联本着不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则行事。苏联将坚忍不拔地为巩固和平，为各国人民的安全而奋斗。
