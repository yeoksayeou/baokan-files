At dinnertime, her mother was frantic with worry because little Mary was missing. The next morning, the news came: Six-year-old Mary was found in a pile of wood about a mile from her home, she had been raped, suffered terribly and died.

    六岁的女孩被强奸致死
    美国“时代”周刊最近刊载一条消息说：在底特律，一个六岁的女孩玛丽·德·古兴有一天蹦蹦跳跳到街上去和她的朋友玩去了。晚饭的时候，她的母亲着急得要发疯了，因为小玛丽失踪了。第二天早上，消息传来了：六岁的玛丽是在离家一里路的地方的木头堆里找到的，她被强奸，受到极可怕的残害，死掉了。
