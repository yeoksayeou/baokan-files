Following the Korean Armistice, the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV), under the principle of being ready to cope with possible sudden incidents, have been intensively engaged in regular training. Over the past four years, remarkable progress has been made, and their combat effectiveness has continuously strengthened.

Prior to 1955, more than half of the CPV units had overall shooting training scores that were below passing. Last year, the shooting training scores of most units reached good or above, and this year, the divisions and regiments implementing the first and second basic shooting exercises for infantry weapons have achieved excellent or good results. The professional and technical training of various arms and specialized units (detachments) has also achieved relatively significant results. Last year, the CPV representatives invited to participate in the national artillery company commander shooting competition all passed, achieving second place overall. In the national artillery company tactical and shooting competition, the CPV's 37 anti-aircraft artillery unit won first place. In the 1954 national armored corps crew competition, the CPV was still at the bottom, but in last year's competition, it jumped to first place in the country. Now, various specialized troops and specialized units (detachments) have initially mastered various complex technologies and can closely cooperate with infantry units in modern warfare.

The vast numbers of officers and soldiers of the CPV have actively responded to the Party's call to "advance towards military science and technology." Last year alone, 64,208 outstanding shooters, technical experts, and advanced workers emerged, including 34,939 outstanding shooters, 23,631 technical experts, and 5,638 advanced workers.

In regular training, the CPV units have begun to attach importance to applying the experience from the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to training with analysis and research, making the training content more in line with actual combat requirements. In recent years, all units have strengthened night training and mountain offensive and defensive training, paying attention to using the valuable experience from past battles, greatly improving the ability of grassroots commanders to organize and command battles in special terrain and conditions, and training soldiers in coordinated actions in night operations, so that new comrades without combat experience gradually become accustomed to night operations.

Since the Korean Armistice, the U.S. invading forces and the Syngman Rhee clique have continuously violated the armistice agreement and engaged in a series of conspiracies. Therefore, the CPV's training has always been closely integrated with combat readiness. The troops guarding the front lines and key points have always maintained a high degree of vigilance. They turn their positions into classrooms or training grounds, and can immediately engage in combat should a situation arise. The anti-aircraft artillery unit guarding a certain river bridge conducts a combat readiness inspection every morning as usual, and can usually switch to first-level combat readiness within a few tens of seconds.

    志愿军战斗力不断加强
    本报讯　朝鲜停战后，志愿军在随时准备应付可能的突然事变的方针下，紧张地进行了正规训练，四年来，成绩突飞猛进，战斗力不断加强。
    1955年以前，志愿军射击训练成绩尚有半数以上单位总评不及格。去年各单位射击训练成绩大都达到良好以上，今年实施步兵武器基本射击第一、二练习的师、团，成绩都是优秀或良好。各兵种、各特业部（分）队的专业技术训练，同样获得了比较明显的成绩。去年应邀参加全国炮兵连长射击竞赛的志愿军代表100％及格，总成绩是第二名；在全国炮兵连战术、射击竞赛中，志愿军37高炮获得第一名。1954年全国装甲兵乘员竞赛时，志愿军还屈居末位，但去年竞赛时，就一跃而为全国第一名。现在，各特种兵、各特业部（分）队都初步掌握了各种复杂技术，并能紧密地配合步兵部队进行现代化作战了。
    志愿军广大官兵积极响应了党所提出的“向军事科学技术进军”的号召，去年一年就出现了优等射手、技术能手和先进工作者六万四千二百零八名，其中优等射手三万四千九百三十九名，技术能手二万三千六百三十一名，先进工作者五千六百三十八名。
    在正规训练中，志愿军各部队都开始重视把抗美援朝战争中的经验，有分析、有研究地运用到训练中去，使训练内容更加切合实战要求。近年来，各部队都加强了夜间训练和山地攻防训练，注意运用过去作战中的宝贵经验，大大提高了基层指挥员在特种地形、条件下组织指挥战斗的能力，锻炼了士兵在夜间作战的协同动作，使没有实战经验的新同志逐渐习惯了夜间行动。
    美国侵略军和李承晚集团从朝鲜停战以来，不断地破坏停战协定，进行着一连串的阴谋活动。因此，志愿军的训练始终是和战备密切结合在一起的。守卫在一线和各要点的部队，始终保持着高度警惕，他们把阵地变成课堂或教练场，一有情况就能立即投入战斗。保卫某江桥的高射炮部队，他们每天早晨都照例进行战备检查，平时能够在几十秒钟以内转入一级战斗准备。
