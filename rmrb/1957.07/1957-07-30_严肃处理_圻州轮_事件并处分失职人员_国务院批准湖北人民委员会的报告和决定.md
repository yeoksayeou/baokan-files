Xinhua News Agency, 29th - The State Council today approved the Hubei Provincial People's Committee's request report and decision on punishing those responsible for the accident of the "Qizhou Wheel" under the Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration. The "Qizhou Wheel" caught fire and sank on April 26th on the Yangtze River near Xihepu, Huanggang County, Hubei, resulting in 117 deaths.

After investigation, it was determined that the main reason for this serious accident was that the engine room personnel of the "Qizhou Wheel" violated operating procedures. Now, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee and the Ministry of Communications have earnestly carried out the aftermath work such as recovering bodies, providing medical treatment, compensation, repatriation, burial, and providing pensions. The Hubei Provincial People's Committee has also made decisions to punish the relevant derelict personnel. It was decided to give Chen Ying, Director of the Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration, a dismissal punishment; to give Captain Tang Xiangang and Chief Mate Chen Yufu a dismissal punishment, and it is recommended that the Procuratorate file a public prosecution against Tang Xiangan and punish him according to law. Yu Shiyuan, the duty engine mechanic and Chen Ruyi, the duty oiler of the Qizhou wheel, the direct persons responsible for this accident, have already died in the accident and are exempted from prosecution.

In addition, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee has also decided to issue a circular of commendation for the active rescue efforts of all the crew members of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration's "Yangtze No. 302" tugboat and the calm handling of the accident by Zhou Jiucai, a sailor on the "Qizhou Wheel," as well as the selfless rescue efforts and heroic sacrifices of two military passengers, and to hold a memorial service and provide pensions for the deceased.
