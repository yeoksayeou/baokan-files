    High Mountains as Witness, Flowing Water as Proof!
    Dong Junlun, Jiang Yuan
    The Yishan mountain area is indeed a beautiful place, with its majestic peaks touching the white clouds, its green slopes adorned with beautiful flowers, its tall cliffs hung with silver waterfalls, and its splashing river, roaring day and night. However, the lives of the people who live in the mountains were not as leisurely and carefree as some literati and artists have described.

    A few days ago, we arrived at the village of Jiejiahe in the Yishan area. Relatively speaking, the soil here is considered good in Yishan. The village has only about a hundred households. Upon entering the village, the most noticeable thing is the newly built thatched houses. They are so numerous, row upon row along the roadside. There are no restaurants in the mountain village. We had lunch at a local villager's home. The family consisted of six people: a grandmother in her seventies, a son, a daughter-in-law, and three granddaughters. The children sat on stools in front of us, and the grandmother was busy boiling water for us. We casually asked the older woman, "Are these three children all yours?" "No, the one in white is from my younger son's family!" "Who is she wearing mourning for?" "For her father! He died last autumn." "What about her mother?" The grandmother sighed deeply. After a moment of silence, she finally spoke: "She is with her aunt! Her mother left, not just recently, but many years ago. She remarried before her father died, before liberation! Not for any other reason, but because of poverty! Poverty broke up the family. That woman was also honest. She walked with a stick begging for three years. That spring, she couldn't beg for food anymore. There was nothing to eat at home, only a short fork of peanut cake left. She said, 'I'll leave! We can't all starve to death at home! I'll raise this little one and he'll still be a member of your family!' The couple never argued or fought! He saw her halfway... The older one stayed with me. Life has been better since the cooperative was established! How could my son not miss his wife and children? If it were today's society, the family wouldn't have broken up! It's hard to see this child. Back then, who would have thought there would be today? If she had known there would be today, his mother wouldn't have left!" The firewood went out, and a thick smoke rose. The grandmother wiped her tears with her clothes...

    In the afternoon, we met the captain of the second production team, Li Chunshou. He was always smiling, with two front teeth missing. When asked, we learned that he had knocked them out last year while pushing manure. He said with a smile: "You see, our land here is all mountainous. If people save energy, the animals have to work harder. I put too much effort in, broke the cart shaft, and hit the crossbar, knocking out two teeth. The animals belong to the cooperative, so you have to be careful." We asked him how life was now, and he told us that his family of eleven people received more than seven thousand jin of grain last year. As if afraid we wouldn't understand, he explained: "This seven thousand jin of grain is more than enough! A family doesn't just consist of adults, there are also children! I am very content! Now, after working, we eat our fill, drink our fill, and lie down on the bed comfortably to sleep. But back then, after begging for a day, the whole family covered themselves with a ragged raincoat at night, and were too hungry to sleep..." This same Li Chunshou's mother had led five children to escape famine and beg outside for many years. One of Li Chunshou's brothers and one of his sisters were sold in Qingzhou Prefecture, exchanging people for grain to eat. Didn't the mother love her children? Didn't it hurt to bite your own finger? But at that time, Jiejiahe was overgrown with weeds, and the village head ran off with small wolf cubs. At that time, the old government only knew how to ask them for donations and taxes, regardless of their hailstorms and droughts, or the oppression and exploitation they suffered. Where did those rightist gentlemen's "anger" go then? Why didn't we hear a word of "sympathy" from them?

    In the evening, we went to the grandmother's house for dinner again. The mountain wind was very cool, and thick clouds surged from the deep blue Yishan peaks. While the older woman was preparing our meal, she kept looking at the sky. We took advantage of the time before eating to open the "People's Daily". Heavens! We simply couldn't believe our eyes. There were actually those saboteurs who dreamed of opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat, opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, and opposing the people's path of socialism. Did they want the days of freezing, starving, and selling wives and children to return to this beautiful mountain area? We were simply furious and wanted to immediately tell the grandmother's family about the dark hearts of these saboteurs. At this time, the grandmother had already gone out. After the older woman finished preparing the meal, she still frowned and looked at the sky. She turned her head and said apologetically: "Comrades, you don't know, my heart jumps whenever it's cloudy. In those years, when it rained, we couldn't go out and couldn't beg for food, and the whole family had to starve blankly. We were just afraid of starving, and it caused me this illness. Now, there is food everywhere, what is there to be afraid of? I just can't help myself." As she spoke, she looked again at the high stack of golden pancakes. She smiled. Thunder rumbled, and lightning flashed, making the tall Yishan look even more majestic and solemn. From the mountain valley came a deep, rumbling sound, and in the wind, the river roared. Listen! The high mountains and flowing water are all angry. In those old societies of heavy taxes and selling wives and children, how many cries had these mountains heard, how many tears had this flowing water tasted... Of course, these would not move those rightist elements, because they were used to eating the blood and sweat of the people and living the bourgeois life. They didn't know how the days of freezing and starving were spent, and they could never understand what it was like to sell wives and children. Listen to the past suffering of the people in this mountain area, and look at their current lives. The barren mountains of the past are now planted with lush green trees, and the gullies where they used to take refuge are now clear reservoirs. Even they will tell those rightist elements to stop making destructive remarks. Every mountain and every stream here is proof.

    高山作证，流水为凭！
    董均伦　江源
    沂山山区确实是一个美丽的地方，那雄伟的山尖触着白云，那青青的山坡上开着好看的鲜花，那高大的峭壁上挂着银亮的瀑布，那飞溅着水花的小河，日日夜夜的哗哗发响，可是生长在山区的人们，他们过去的日子，并不像有的文人、墨客所描写的那样悠闲，自在。
    前几天，我们到了沂山地区的接家河村，说起来这里的土质在沂山里，是不错的了。这个村子统共算起来也不过百十户人家，进村来，最惹人注意的，就是那些新盖的草屋，它们是那样的多，一栋又一栋的座落在路旁。山村里是没有饭店的，午饭，我们是在一家老乡家里吃的。他们一家六口人，一个七十多岁的老奶奶，一个儿子，一个媳妇，还有三个孙女。孩子们搬着板凳坐在我们跟前，老奶奶忙着替我们烧开水。我们很随便的问那个大嫂：“这三个孩子都是你的吗？”“不，那个穿白的是俺小叔家的呀！”“给谁穿孝呢？”“给他爹呀！他爹在去年秋天死去了。”“他娘呢？”那老奶奶长长的叹了一口气，一阵沉默以后，老奶奶才开口了：“他是跟着他大娘呀！他娘走了，不是才走的，走了多年啦，解放前，他爹没死就另嫁了人啊！不为别的，就是穷走了呀！穷散了呀，那媳妇子也是老实人，在这里拄着棍子讨了三年饭，那年春天，讨饭也讨不出来了，家里什么吃的也没有，只还有一叉长短的一块花生饼，她说道：‘我走了吧！不能都在家里饿死呀！我抱着这个小的，把他养大成人还是你家人呀！’小两口子从来没红红脸，吵吵嘴啊！他把她送到了半路……剩下这个大的，就跟着我了。前年办了社，日子好过啦！俺那儿怎么能不想他那老婆孩子，要是在今天这个社会里，那还能家破人散呀！看看这个孩子就难受。从前，那里寻思还有今天，知道有今天，他娘也不会走啊！”柴火灭了，冒出了一阵浓烟，老奶奶掀起衣襟擦了擦眼泪……。
    过午的时候，我们认识了第二生产队队长——李春收，他总是笑哈哈的，中间还缺着两个门牙。问起来，才知道是去年推粪磕去的。他笑着说道：“你们看见了吧，我们这里都是山岭地，人要是省了劲，牲口就要费力了。我使的劲大了，把车盘抻断了，磕在车档上，牙也碰去了两个。牲口是社里的，就更得上心呀。”我们问他，现在的生活过得怎样，他告诉说，去年他家十一口人分了七千多斤粮。好像生怕我们不明白似的，还解释说道：“这七千多斤粮是满够用的啊！一家人不能只是大人，还有孩子哪！我是很知足啊！这如今做活回来，吃得饱饱的，喝得足足的，往炕上一躺，舒舒服服的睡了。可是那阵，讨了一天饭，夜里全家盖着一件破蓑衣，肚子饿的还睡不着……。”就是这个李春收的娘，曾经领着五个孩子逃荒到外面讨饭多年，李春收的一个兄弟和一个妹妹，就是卖在青州府，把人换回粮吃了。难道当娘的不疼孩子吗？难道自己的指头自己咬着不疼吗？可是那时候的接家河，庄里草长老高，庄头就跑小狼羔。那时候，旧政府只知道跟他们要捐要税，不管他们有什么雹灾旱灾，受什么样的欺压剥削，那时候，那些右派先生们的“火气”，到那里去了？为什么听不到他们的一句“同情”的话呢？
    晚上，我们又去那老奶奶家吃饭，山风吹得很凉，浓云从那深蓝色的沂山顶上涌了上来。大嫂一面给我们拾掇饭，一面不住的看天，我们趁吃饭以前这点时间，掀开“人民日报”。天呀！我们简直不相信自己的眼睛，居然有那种破坏分子，竟梦想反对无产阶级专政，竟反对共产党的领导，竟反对人民走社会主义的路子，难道说还要让那受冻受饿典妻卖子的日子回到这美丽的山区里来吗？我们简直是忿怒极了，想把这些破坏分子的黑心肠，立刻告诉老奶奶一家人。这时老奶奶已经出去了。大嫂拾掇完饭，还皱着眉头看天，她转回了头，不好意思的说道：“同志，您是不知道啊，一到阴天，我的心就跳，那些年月，到了下雨天，出不去，讨不上吃的来，一家人就得白瞪眼挨饿，就是饿怕了，饿出这么个病来，现在，满屋里，都是吃的，还害怕什么，就是不由自己啊。”说着又看了一下那摞得高高的金黄煎饼，她笑了。雷响了，闪也亮了，那高大的沂山看去更加威武庄严，从山涧里传出了深沉的、隆隆的响声，风声中，河水哗啦啦的吼叫。听吧！高山流水都发怒了。在那些捐税重重，典妻卖子的旧社会里，这些大山听到过多少哭声，这流水尝过多少眼泪……当然，这一些不会打动那些右派分子们，因为他们吃惯了的是人民的血汗，过惯了的是资产阶级生活，他们不知道受冻挨饿的日子怎么过的，他们也永远体会不到，典妻卖子的人是什么滋味。听一听这山区的人们过去的苦处，看一看他们现在的生活吧。从前荒秃的大山，现在已经栽满碧绿的小树，从前他们躲难的山沟，现在已是清清的水库，连它们也要告诉那些右派分子们，少发表破坏言论，这里的一山一水都是凭证。
