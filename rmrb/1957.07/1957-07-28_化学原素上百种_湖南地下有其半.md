Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 26th (Xinhua reporter Liu Haijin): Through exploration since liberation, particularly during the First Five-Year Plan, Hunan Province has been proven to be one of the provinces with the richest mineral resources in our country. Up to now, Hunan Province has discovered dozens of kinds of non-ferrous, rare, and ferrous metals, as well as non-metallic minerals. Of all one hundred and one elements in the periodic table of chemical elements, more than half can be obtained from the aforementioned dozens of mineral types. Almost every one of these dozens of mineral types has more than one deposit in Hunan Province, and the vast majority of the minerals have great or considerable industrial mining value.

According to existing materials from the geological departments, the known mineral deposits in Hunan Province with industrial mining value include known deposits of antimony, realgar, lead, zinc, tungsten, tin, and molybdenum. There are also many non-ferrous and rare metal deposits that are rare in China, such as beryllium, bismuth, germanium, cadmium, lithium, tantalum, and gallium. There are relatively large reserves of coal and very abundant manganese, and a considerable amount of iron ore south of the Yangtze River. There are also non-metallic minerals such as diamonds, barite, fluorite, graphite, porcelain clay, and phosphate rock.

    化学原素上百种  湖南地下有其半
    据新华社长沙26日电　新华社记者刘海金报道：经过解放以后特别是第一个五年计划期间的勘探，湖南省被证明是我国矿产最丰富的省份之一。到目前为止，湖南省发现的有色、稀有和黑色金属和非金属的矿种已经有几十种，化学原素周期表中所有一百○一种原素，半数以上可以从上述几十种矿种中得到。这几十种矿种在湖南省几乎每种都不止有一个矿床，而绝大多数矿种具有很大的或相当大的工业开采价值。
    根据地质部门现有的材料，湖南省现在已知有工业开采价值的矿床中，包括有已知的锑矿、雄黄矿、铅、锌、钨、锡、钼矿；有国内少见的铍、铋、锗、镉、锂、钽、镓等许多有色和稀有金属矿床；有长江以南储量较多的煤和很丰富的锰和相当数量的铁矿；还有金刚石，重晶石、萤石、石墨、瓷土和磷矿等非金属矿。
