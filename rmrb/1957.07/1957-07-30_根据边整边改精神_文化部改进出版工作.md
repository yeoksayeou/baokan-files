Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: The Ministry of Culture, accepting the well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions from various sectors regarding publishing work, and acting according to the Central government's spirit of rectification while correcting, is actively taking measures to gradually improve publishing work. A specialized group has been established to sort out and study the opinions and suggestions on publishing work from various aspects, prioritizing them according to their importance and urgency, and beginning to improve or formulate specific plans for gradually improving publishing work.

In the first half of this year, many publishing and distribution units have already strived to improve existing shortcomings in their work based on the opinions put forward by various parties. The phenomena of duplication in publications and "sloppiness" caused by poor quality have decreased in the first half of this year. In the past, situations where printed documents were stockpiled or sold out due to subjective estimations based on learning needs have also changed.

The publication of academic works and research materials has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. For example, the People's Publishing House and Sanlian Bookstore have published Tang Yongtong's "Draft on Wei-Jin Metaphysics," Cen Zhongmian's "History of the Yellow River's Changes," and translations such as Hegel's "Lectures on the History of Philosophy." The Science Press, Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, Shanghai People's Publishing House, and Hubei People's Publishing House have also published many academic works.

In addition, the Ministry of Culture has also issued a notice requiring publishers in various provinces and cities to not only pay attention to publishing popular and intermediate-level books but also to publish academic works by local authors.

In order to meet readers' needs and solve the problem of shortages of some books, publishing units such as the People's Publishing House, People's Literature Publishing House, and Science Press have decided to reprint a large number of books. Books that have been reprinted and are being reprinted include classic works such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Das Kapital," "Dialectics of Nature," and "Philosophical Notebooks," as well as important literary works and reference books such as "Anna Karenina," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Three Hundred Tang Poems," "Defend Yan'an," "Midnight," and "Selected Materials on Modern Chinese History."

Many publishing houses have already improved or are improving the editing and proofreading system, further clarifying the responsibilities of editors and authors in book publishing, in order to reduce conflicts between writers and publishers and enable publishers to cooperate better with writers to improve the quality of book publishing. In terms of book distribution, it has been preliminarily decided that qualified and necessary publishers can consider distributing some of their own books, and more publishers can run their own mail order business; at the same time, it has also been clarified that the number of books printed is determined by the publisher, and the number of orders is determined by the bookstore.

    根据边整边改精神
    文化部改进出版工作
    据新华社28日讯　文化部接受各界人士对出版工作的善意批评和建议，根据中央边整边改的精神，正在积极采取措施，逐步改进出版工作。目前已经成立了专门的小组，负责整理和研究各方面对出版工作的意见和建议，分别轻重缓急，开始改进或拟定逐步改进出版工作的具体方案。
    今年上半年，不少出版发行单位已经根据各方面提出的意见，努力改进工作中存在的缺点。出版物的重复和因质量不高而造成
  “滥”的现象，在今年上半年已经减少。过去因配合学习需要，凭主观估计形成印刷文件积压或脱销的情况，也已经有所改变。
    学术著作和供研究需要的资料书的出版，比去年同期有很大增长。如人民出版社和三联书店就出版了汤用彤的“魏晋玄学论稿”，岑仲勉的“黄河变迁史”等著作，以及黑格尔的“哲学史讲演录”等翻译著作。科学出版社、商务印书馆、中华书局、上海人民出版社、湖北人民出版社出版的学术著作也不少。
    此外，文化部并且已经发出通知，要求各省市出版社除注意出版通俗的中级的图书外，也应该注意出版地方作者的学术著作。
    为了供应读者需要，解决部分缺书现象，人民出版社、人民文学出版社、科学出版社等出版单位，还决定重印一大批书籍。已经重印和正在重印中的书籍，有“毛泽东选集”“资本论”、“自然辩证法”、“哲学笔记”等经典著作，也有“安娜·卡列尼娜”、“三国演义”、“唐诗三百首”、“保卫延安”、“子夜”、“中国近代史资料选辑”等重要的文学作品和工具书。
    不少出版社已经或正在改进编辑审校制度，进一步明确了在书籍出版上编辑和作者分别负担的责任，以减少作家同出版社之间的矛盾，使出版社同作家更好的合作以提高书籍出版的质量。在书籍发行方面，已初步决定，有条件、有必要的出版社可以考虑自己发行一部分书籍，更多的出版社可以自办邮购业务；同时，还明确了书籍的印数由出版社决定，订货数由书店决定的原则。
