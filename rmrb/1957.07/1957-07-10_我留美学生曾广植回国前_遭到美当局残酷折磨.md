Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 8th: Our student Zeng Guangzhi, who returned here from the United States on the evening of the 6th, told reporters yesterday that after the US Immigration Bureau learned that Ambassador Wang Bingnan had requested his return to China in Geneva, they handcuffed him and locked him in a mental hospital. He was deported only after being tortured in the mental hospital for fourteen months.

As Zeng Guangzhi spoke, he rolled up his sleeves, letting the reporters see a small scar left by the handcuffs on his right wrist. He said that in the mental hospital, he was kept in a solitary, dark room for a long time. He was not allowed to see friends or write to his mother. He said: "Later, they suddenly deported me without any explanation and let me return to China."

Zeng Guangzhi is thirty-eight years old this year and was originally studying organic chemistry at Purdue University in Indiana. He shows no signs of being mentally abnormal. He said that his body and mind were very normal when he was arrested. Shortly before his arrest, the university doctor had given him a full examination and found that he had no problems. He produced a copy of his transcript issued by the school authorities a month before he was forcibly sent to the mental hospital, which stated that his grades in theoretical organic chemistry and advanced pharmaceutical chemistry were both A.

Zeng Guangzhi said that he will soon go to Beijing, where he hopes to make teaching his career.

Xinhua News Agency, July 9th, Lafayette, Indiana: An official at Purdue University in Indiana admitted on the 8th that US authorities had kept Chinese student Zeng Guangzhi in a mental sanatorium in Indiana for fourteen months.

Professor Titchenor, the foreign student advisor at Purdue University, said that Zeng Guangzhi was "a good young man." But he thought Zeng's view of the world was "problematic." He said that if he could change in this respect, he would be "a remarkable student."

    我留美学生曾广植回国前
    遭到美当局残酷折磨
    据新华社广州8日电　6日晚上从美国回到这里的我国留学生曾广植昨天对记者说，美国移民局在知道王炳南大使已经在日内瓦要求让他回中国以后，给他戴上手铐，把他关进了一所精神病院。他在精神病院内受了十四个月的折磨以后才被驱逐出境。
    曾广植说着卷起了衣袖，让记者们看他右手腕上被手铐留下的一小块伤痕。他说，在精神病院内，他长期被关在一间单人的黑屋子内。在那里既不准接见朋友，也无法写信给他的母亲。他说：“后来，他们又未经任何解释突然把我驱逐出境，放我回中国了。”
    曾广植今年三十八岁，原来在印第安纳的帕都大学攻读有机化学。丝毫没有神经不正常的样子。他说他在被捕的时候身体和精神都很正常。在被捕前不久，大学里的医生曾经对他作了全面检查，查明他没有什么毛病。他拿出了在被强制送入精神病院的一月前学校当局发给他的成绩单的抄本，其中说明他在理论有机化学和高等制药化学方面的成绩都是甲等。
    曾广植说，他不久就要到北京去，他希望在那里以教学为自己的职业。
    据新华社9日讯　印第安纳州拉斐德县讯：美国帕都大学的一个负责人8日承认美国当局曾经把中国留美学生曾广植关在印第安纳州的一个精神病疗养院内达十四个月之久。
    帕都大学的外国学生顾问提彻诺尔教授说，曾广植是“一个很好的年轻人”。但是他认为曾对世界的看法“有问题”。他说，如果在这方面他能够有所改变，那他就会是“一个了不起的学生”。
