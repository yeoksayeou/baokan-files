To the Editor:

Recently, during the public trial at the Dongdan District People's Court, a criminal named Wang Yufeng said the following while being sentenced: "The person who visited me and asked me to write materials expressing opinions about the leadership was the rightist Tan Tiwu."

Wang Yufeng was a technician at the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. In his work, he consistently failed to work diligently, disobeyed leadership, and verbally abused leaders. He would go to work when he was happy, and not go when he was unhappy. From January 1956, he even stopped going to work for six consecutive months, while still receiving his salary. This was because he harbored extreme hatred for socialism. He said, "If my past landlord living standard was 200%, it was only 130% during the Japanese puppet regime, and now it has been reduced to 60%." Therefore, he openly said, "The change in life has determined what I should support and what path I should take?" The leaders of the Ministry patiently educated him, and colleagues constantly helped him, but he not only did not change but also cursed anyone who tried to help him.

The Ministry of Petroleum Industry, seeing that Wang Yufeng was beyond redemption, had no choice but to dismiss him from the organization. After being dismissed, Wang Yufeng went to Kunming, Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places to swindle and cheat, posing as a Communist Party member and an engineer; he did not pay for lodging or meals. Or he would curse the Communist Party and leading cadres in the streets. After the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC discovered this, they sent him back to Beijing. After returning to Beijing, Wang Yufeng wrote letters everywhere "accusing" the leading cadres of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. After the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress received Wang Yufeng's letter, it sent Tan Tiwu to investigate the truth of the matter.

After accepting this task, Tan Tiwu first talked to Wang Yufeng and then asked the leading cadres of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry to report to her and make self-criticisms. When reporting to the "NPC," Tan Tiwu did not base her report on all the materials, but rather on Wang Yufeng's statements and the self-criticisms of individual leaders of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. She also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Industry's dismissal of Wang Yufeng was wrong and that Wang Yufeng should be reinstated.

The comrades in the Ministry of Petroleum Industry were very angry about this practice and immediately wrote a letter to the Standing Committee of the "NPC," asking Tan Tiwu to come down to investigate the truth and listen to everyone's voices. However, Tan Tiwu never came. Now we understand that if Tan Tiwu had really come down, she would not have been able to manipulate things. Is Tan Tiwu really unclear about this matter? Of course not. This is because she has ulterior motives.

After Wang Yufeng received Tan Tiwu's support, his attitude became even worse. He openly posted reactionary slogans on the street, shouting that he wanted to kill Communist Party members... One night, Wang Yufeng pretended to be drunk and rushed into Minister Li's dormitory, making a scene, destroying objects, and attempting to commit violence. He was stopped by public security personnel. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry filed a lawsuit with the court and reported the situation to Tan Tiwu. At this time, Tan Tiwu said that only the court could handle it now. That night, Tan Tiwu rushed to Wang Yufeng's house to discuss matters. After Wang Yufeng was arrested, Tan Tiwu went to the court to defend Wang Yufeng, saying that the Communist Party and the People's Government had violated Wang Yufeng's human rights and demanded his release.

From these facts, it is not difficult to see that Wang Yufeng's disregard for the law and his daring to post reactionary slogans on the street and attempt to kill people are inseparable from Tan Tiwu's encouragement and support. We cannot help but ask: Tan Tiwu is a people's representative; instead of standing on the people's side and speaking for the people, she went to support Wang Yufeng. What is the reason for this? Why don't you make a self-criticism on this type of issue?

### 谭惕吾支持的是什么样的人？

    谭惕吾支持的是什么样的人？编辑同志：
    最近在东单区人民法院的公审会上，一个名叫王裕丰的罪犯在被判徒刑的时候这样说：“访问我和要我写对领导意见的材料的人就是右派分子谭惕吾。”
    王裕丰是石油工业部的技术员，在工作中一贯不好好工作，不服从领导，谩骂领导；高兴时就上班，不高兴时就不上班。从1956年1月起，他竟连续达六个月不上班，而工资却照领。这因为他对社会主义怀着极度的仇恨。他说：“我过去过的地主生活标准如果是200％，在日伪时期只有130％，而现在竟降低到60％。”因此他公开说：“生活的改变决定了我应该拥护什么，走什么道路？”部的领导干部耐心地对他进行教育，同事也不断地对他进行帮助，他不仅不改，而且谁去帮助他就骂谁。
    石油工业部看到王裕丰已不可教育，只得把他开除出机关。被开除后，王裕丰就到昆明、成都、重庆等地招摇撞骗，冒充共产党员，冒充工程师；住宿、吃饭都不给钱。或者沿街谩骂共产党，谩骂领导干部。中共重庆市委发现后就把他送回北京。王裕丰回到北京后，便四处写信“控告”石油工业部的领导干部。“人大”常委会接到王裕丰的信后，就派谭惕吾去了解这一事情的真相。
    谭惕吾接受这一任务后，先去找王裕丰谈话，然后叫石油工业部的领导干部向她汇报和检讨。向“人大”作汇报时，谭惕吾不是根据全部材料，而是根据王裕丰的谈话，和石油工业部个别领导干部的检讨；并说石油工业部开除王裕丰是错误的，应该恢复王裕丰的职务。
    石油工业部的同志对这种作法非常气愤，马上写信给“人大”常委会，要求谭惕吾下来了解真相，听听大家的呼声。谭惕吾却始终没有来。现在我们才了解，谭惕吾真下来了，就没有戏法可变了。谭惕吾是否真不清楚这回事呢？当然不是。这因为她有不可告人的目的。
    王裕丰得到谭惕吾的支持后，态度就更加恶劣，公然在大街上贴反动标语，叫喊要杀共产党员……。在一个晚上，王裕丰假装喝醉了酒，冲到李部长的宿舍里大吵大闹、捣毁物件，并企图行凶，后经公安人员制止。石油工业部为此一面向法院提起诉讼，一面将这情况向谭惕吾反映。这时谭惕吾说现在只有由法院来处理了。当夜谭惕吾却又赶到王裕丰家里去商量事情。王裕丰被逮捕后，谭惕吾就到法院去替王裕丰辩护，说这是共产党和人民政府侵犯了王裕丰的人权，要法院释放。
    从这些事实不难看出，王裕丰之所以这样目无法纪，敢在大街上张贴反动标语，要行凶杀人，这与谭惕吾的怂恿、支持分不开的。我们不禁要问：谭惕吾是人民代表，不站在人民的立场替人民说话，反而去支持王裕丰。这究竟是为了什么？在这一类问题上你为什么不作检查呢？
