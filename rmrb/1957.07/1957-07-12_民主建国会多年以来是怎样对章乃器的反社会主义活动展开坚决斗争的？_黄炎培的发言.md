Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people is, in our opinion, another creative development of Marxism-Leninism in the specific conditions of China. It not only helps us all to brighten our eyes and more clearly see the path of our country's advance towards socialism, but also provides us with a weapon to thoroughly defeat the ambitions of the rightists.

Premier Zhou's government work report, based on the principles put forward in Chairman Mao's report, specifically explained the great achievements made by our country in socialist revolution and socialist construction in 1956. It also humbly pointed out the shortcomings and errors in our work, and at the same time, used ironclad facts to refute the various fallacies of the rightists against socialism and the people's democratic dictatorship.

What I never expected was that: The Constitution of the People's Republic of China, with its articles stipulated so clearly, and not even three years since its promulgation, today Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, and others who personally participated in raising their hands to pass that supreme and solemn national fundamental law, dare to openly say to the people, and secretly do things that are absolutely contrary to the Constitution with absurd and outrageous remarks and behaviors. No wonder it aroused the anger of the broad masses of the people. As one of the persons in charge of the China Democratic National Construction Association, I have the obligation to specifically explain to the National People's Congress about Zhang Naiqi, a right-wing ambitious element within the China Democratic National Construction Association.

As everyone knows, the right-wing ambitious element Zhang Naiqi was decided by the joint meeting of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce on June 19th to: "Suspend all duties within the association and order self-criticism" for the China Democratic National Construction Association, and "Suspend duties for self-criticism" for the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

Now I will give you a brief report on the struggle between the China Democratic National Construction Association and Zhang Naiqi, so that everyone can fully understand Zhang Naiqi's ugly true face and join us in continuing to launch a resolute struggle against Zhang Naiqi nationwide!

Representatives! Everyone already knows that Zhang Naiqi used all kinds of cunning tricks at the State Council meeting, was disrespectful to the Premier, refused all criticism, and insisted that he was very good (written in the Dagong Daily on June 28th). Zhang Naiqi put on the stinking airs of the bourgeoisie at the Sichuan group meeting, spoke rudely, and showed an intolerable and extremely bad attitude (written in the People's Daily on July 3rd). Representatives! Who knew that Zhang Naiqi's cunning, rudeness, and bad behavior were already "commonplace" in the meetings and groups of the China Democratic National Construction Association.

Zhang Naiqi previously held the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Standing Committee in the China Democratic National Construction Association. His remarks had a certain influence among the broad industrial and commercial circles. Since liberation, Zhang Naiqi has long used his position in the China Democratic National Construction Association to spread a lot of poison to the industrial and commercial circles. Many comrades of the China Democratic National Construction Association have been fighting against him for a long time. The struggle started very early. Now everyone further realizes that our struggle against Zhang Naiqi is simply a struggle between two lines. Zhang Naiqi does not take the socialist road like us, but instead takes the capitalist road.

As everyone knows, the China Democratic National Construction Association is a democratic party mainly composed of national bourgeois elements. After liberation, as China's revolution had entered the stage of socialist revolution, its main political task was to undertake the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In the process of this transformation, it also helped the ideological remolding of national bourgeois elements. In short, the political line of the China Democratic National Construction Association accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has been consistent.

Zhang Naiqi has made a big fuss about the political line of the China Democratic National Construction Association three times, and the small troubles are too numerous to mention.

However, the China Democratic National Construction Association had disagreements on this point, mainly with Zhang Naiqi. Since liberation, Zhang Naiqi has consistently quarreled with many comrades in the leadership of the China Democratic National Construction Association, causing disunity. In the past, everyone did not quite understand his intentions. Now, looking back, we deeply realize that what he was fighting for with us, besides his personal leadership position and so on, was mainly the political line of the China Democratic National Construction Association. In our memory, Zhang Naiqi has made a big fuss with us about the political line of the China Democratic National Construction Association three times since liberation, and the small troubles are too numerous to mention. Now let me briefly talk about how the three big troubles happened:

The first time was in April 1950. It was not long after liberation, and we had agreed to make uniting, supporting, educating, and transforming national industrialists and businessmen the main task of the association. Zhang Naiqi initially had no objection. Later, he suddenly expressed his disagreement. The question he raised was "Who unites, supports, educates, and transforms them?" He believed that "This may be interpreted as some prescient and even self-proclaimed activists uniting the generally backward and pitiful national industrialists and businessmen, supporting, educating, and transforming them." Therefore, he said: "The China Democratic National Construction Association belongs to them (referring to industrialists and businessmen). Revolutionary intellectuals and young cadres are only serving them." It is very clear that he did not want the association to absorb revolutionary intellectuals and young cadres to assist industrialists and businessmen in carrying out transformation under the leadership of the Party, but only wanted the association to become a purely bourgeois political party.

At that time, Zhang Naiqi gave speeches everywhere in Beijing and Tianjin, advocating that industrialists and businessmen should work hard to "exploit," and beautified the "exploitation" of Chinese capitalists, such as saying that the exploitation of Chinese capitalists was "exploitation without exploitation consciousness," etc. On the one hand, he emphasized within the association that intellectuals must not be ashamed to serve the bourgeoisie, and so on. In Zhang Naiqi's mind, there was never the idea that the China Democratic National Construction Association was responsible for the transformation of bourgeois elements under the leadership of the Party. Of course, Zhang Naiqi's views could not but be opposed by the majority of comrades in our association. During the "Three-Anti" campaign, many comrades gave severe criticism. But Zhang Naiqi did not show any repentance.

The second time was in 1955, when the China Democratic National Construction Association held its first National Congress, Zhang Naiqi again had a serious dispute with us on the political line. This was the "red bourgeois political party" issue he raised at the time.

The word "red" represents revolution and belongs to the scope of common sense. The Chinese national bourgeoisie, at the stage of socialist revolution, as a class, is already a class to be eliminated. How can the word "red" be used to represent it again? Zhang Naiqi should not have known that his reason for proposing this slogan at that time was obviously that in his mind, the Chinese national bourgeoisie was a class that did not need to be transformed, let alone a class that needed to be eliminated. He wanted to regard the China Democratic National Construction Association as a "red bourgeois political party" in order to compete with the red working-class party, isn't this intention obvious enough! The members of the China Democratic National Construction Association are clear-headed. As soon as Zhang Naiqi's slogan was put forward, like in 1950, it was immediately opposed by the vast majority of members. But Zhang Naiqi still did not realize his mistakes.

The third time was in 1956, when the association held its First Session of the Second Plenary Meeting, Zhang Naiqi began to put forward a series of absurd theories to oppose the bourgeoisie accepting socialist transformation. The main issues were related to the two-sidedness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie and the relationship with the working class.

In 1956, Zhang Naiqi initially said at the First Session of the Second Plenary Meeting of the China Democratic National Construction Association that the Chinese national bourgeoisie no longer had the so-called "two-sidedness" after the overall public-private partnership of the entire industry. Later, he said that the "two-sidedness" of the bourgeoisie was the same as that of the working class. It was only the "two-sidedness" of "advanced" and "backward". In addition, he unscrupulously vilified the Chinese working class, vilified Communist Party members, and used this to provoke industrialists and businessmen to accept the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party). The First Session of the Second Plenary Meeting of the China Democratic National Construction Association solemnly criticized Zhang Naiqi's fallacies for this reason, and solemnly made a resolution stating that the two-sidedness of the Chinese national bourgeoisie still existed after the overall public-private partnership of capitalist industry and commerce. Although its content and form of expression have been different from the past. But the bourgeoisie and the working class are obviously not comparable in essence. The meeting especially emphasized that China's people's democratic dictatorship is essentially a form of proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision proposed by the Chinese Communist Party must not be understood as having any essential similarity with the "democratic politics" under any capitalist system, and must not be understood as we can compete with the Chinese Communist Party! We believe that any misinterpretation of this principle that deviates from socialist principles is wrong. From today's point of view, our arguments at the time were not only against Zhang Naiqi, but also against all the arguments of today's rightists, and were tit-for-tat.

After the rectification campaign began, Zhang Naiqi continued to attack the Party frantically, becoming a representative of a small group of people who opposed taking the socialist road.

After the several resolutions of the Second Plenary Meeting of the China Democratic National Construction Association were conveyed to all members, they were supported by the majority of members. But Zhang Naiqi was not reconciled to his failure. After the Second Plenary Meeting, not only did he continue to adhere to his absurd arguments, but he simply further distorted Chairman Mao's remarks, saying that the working class also had a two-sided class, thereby confusing the distinction between the bourgeoisie and the working class, and denying that the transformation of the Chinese national bourgeoisie was a "transformation of bones." Of course, the reason why Zhang Naiqi wanted to make a big fuss about the "two-sidedness" of the bourgeoisie was to resist the Party's transformation work on national bourgeois elements, that is, Zhang Naiqi opposed the leadership of the Party, which of course has been a long-standing matter. But in the past, it was relatively hidden. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, when inspecting the work of the United Front Work Department, his anti-Party attitude took the opportunity to be exposed.

After the Party's rectification movement began this year, in addition to continuing to spread many of the original absurd arguments, Zhang Naiqi even more blatantly launched a frantic attack on the Party. For example, in his article "Starting from the Ideological Basis of 'Walls' and 'Gullies'" published in the People's Daily, he openly distorted the original meaning of Stalin's saying that Party members are made of special materials, and in essence opposed the role of Party members as the vanguard of the working class. He also put forward slogans such as opposing "big partyism" and opposing the Party organization "coming to the fore," excluding the Party's leadership over democratic parties and the Party's leadership over all administrative work. It can be said that it is no different from Chu Anping's idea of "the party's world".

Zhang Naiqi not only opposed the Party himself, but also encouraged industrialists and businessmen to oppose the Party together. Posing as a sympathizer of industrialists and businessmen, in his article "Several Questions on the Transformation Counseling Work of Industry and Commerce" published in the June issue of the Industry and Commerce Circles Monthly, he actually raised the banner of anti-doctrinairism and bureaucracy, and directly launched the most vicious attacks on Party leaders who advocated that today's industrialists and businessmen still have two-sidedness. Zhang Naiqi also put forward the slogan "Bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism" in an article titled "Several Issues Concerning the Guidance of Industrial and Commercial Transformation," while praising capitalism and vilifying socialism.

From this, it can be seen that the road that Zhang Naiqi plans to take is indeed the opposite of the road we are taking. Because what we are taking is the socialist road, the deeper we go, the more we feel the need to pay more attention to transforming ourselves and the need to get closer to the Party. And Zhang Naiqi is the opposite. The deeper he goes, the more he wants to oppose the leadership of the Party, and the more he wants to oppose accepting socialist transformation. This precisely illustrates the law of social development. When the vast majority of Chinese national industrialists and businessmen are willing to accept the leadership of the Party and move towards the socialist road, there will inevitably be a small group of people who will rise up to oppose taking this socialist road - and Zhang Naiqi is precisely the representative of this small group of people.

The political line of accepting socialist transformation and the leadership of the Party must not be changed.

Based on what has been said above, we can see that Zhang Naiqi's becoming a right-wing ambitious element is by no means accidental, nor is it sudden. In the past, outsiders did not understand and thought that there was long-term disunity and factionalism within the China Democratic National Construction Association. Today, everyone understands that it is not anything else at all, it is the struggle between two lines, the struggle between accepting socialist transformation and not accepting socialist transformation, and the struggle between accepting the leadership of the Party and not accepting the leadership of the Party. Here, I would like to especially point out that due to the Party's consistent correct leadership and assistance, the vast majority of our China Democratic National Construction Association members, including many industrialists and businessmen, are willing to get closer to the Party and accept the leadership of the Party. Therefore, since liberation, although there have been many shortcomings and errors in our work, we have not been lost because of the influence of Zhang Naiqi's fallacies. We have not lost our political direction, or even had changes in the political line of the China Democratic National Construction Association. This should be gratifying to the people of the whole country. From now on, I dare to guarantee to the conference that the China Democratic National Construction Association will always follow the Chinese Communist Party.

We are taking further steps to expose and analyze Zhang Naiqi's bad qualities, fierce behavior, and all the despicable methods he used to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. What I want to explain here is that after participating in the struggle against a right-wing ambitious element like Zhang Naiqi, I have a new insight, that is: In the past, I swallowed the principle of "unity, criticism, unity" whole. Now I further realize Chairman Mao's new instruction "Starting from the desire for unity, after criticism or struggle, the contradictions are resolved, so as to achieve new unity on a new basis." This point is worth savoring carefully. What is called "new basis"? Judging from the fact that a large group of members of the China Democratic National Construction Association have been fighting with Zhang Naiqi for a long time and have never been able to achieve unity, the "new basis" that cannot be achieved is the common political basis. If the routes taken by each other are already two, can a common political basis still be achieved? Chairman Mao's report also has a brilliant instruction: "Without correct political views, it is equivalent to having no soul." Everyone thinks: If the soul is gone, can a common political basis still be established with him? Can we still unite with him? Comrades of the China Democratic National Construction Association have used a lot of patience and persuasion methods for Zhang Naiqi for many years, but have finally failed to achieve unity. Now we have received Chairman Mao's instructions. Representatives! Many friendly parties and groups in the audience, some are launching rectification work, and some are also cracking down on right-wing ambitious elements like our China Democratic National Construction Association. The China Democratic National Construction Association is willing to contribute all its fighting experience to everyone for reference.

The struggle against Zhang Naiqi is a link in the entire anti-rightist struggle. We will never stop until we achieve our goal.

The Zhang Naiqi issue, and even the issue of all rightists, is no longer an issue of individual people, but an issue of a small group of anti-socialist and anti-Party small groups that have emerged in the process of socialist transformation in our country. These rightists are actually echoing and supporting each other. As far as Zhang Naiqi is concerned, he openly supported Chu Anping and openly asked Zhang Bojun to "not surrender," all of which were written on the newspaper. This shows that the struggle we are launching against Zhang Naiqi today is an important link in the entire anti-rightist struggle.

Now, the anti-Party and anti-socialist true face of the bourgeois rightists represented by Zhang Naiqi has been nakedly exposed. But the rightists under his influence still exist in various places. We must be vigilant and continue to expand and thoroughly carry out this anti-rightist revolutionary struggle nationwide. This is a serious class struggle. We, the people who support the Party and support socialism, must stand firm, resolutely participate in the battle, and never stop until we achieve our goal.

Representatives! We all personally participated in the formulation of the Constitution. I personally firmly believe with great confidence that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, led by the working class, and based on the worker-peasant alliance, the people's democratic system will surely be able to eliminate exploitation and poverty through peaceful means and build a prosperous and happy socialist society. What we have mastered is the truth, and this truth has gradually been accepted by the broad masses of the people and has become an irresistible force. Where is this force manifested? It is manifested in the eight characters often said by the general public: "The general trend is irreversible, and the people's hearts are inclined to it." This small group of right-wing ambitious elements, including Zhang Naiqi, vainly try to stir up trouble, and the result will only become a bubble. I believe that after this anti-rightist struggle, not only the China Democratic National Construction Association and various friendly parties and groups will strive to win more comrades who sincerely believe in the Chinese Communist Party and more powerfully participate in socialist construction and socialist transformation, but also see that the unity of the broad masses of the people across the country is more consolidated.

Let all the people who support the Chinese Communist Party and support Chairman Mao Zedong unite in the victory of this great anti-rightist struggle!

Resolutely accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!

Resolutely take the socialist road!

    民主建国会多年以来是怎样对章乃器的反社会主义活动展开坚决斗争的？
    黄炎培的发言
    毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题报告，我们认为是马克思列宁主义在中国具体情况下又一次创造性的发展，它不但帮助我们大家擦亮了眼睛，使得更加明确地看清楚我们国家向社会主义前进的道路，还供给了我们一个彻底击败右派野心分子的武器。
    周总理政府工作报告根据了毛主席报告所提出的方针，具体地说明了一九五六年我国在社会主义革命与社会主义建设工作中所取得的巨大成就，也虚心地指出了工作中间的缺点跟错误，同时用铁一般的事实驳斥了右派的反社会主义、反人民民主专政的各种谬论。
    我万万料不到的是：中华人民共和国宪法一条又一条地规定得那么明确，公布还没有满三年，到今天就是当时亲身参加举手通过那部无上庄严的国家根本大法的章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器等在人民面前敢于明目张胆地说，偷偷摸摸地干那些和宪法绝对违反的荒谬绝伦的言论和行为。怪不得激起广大人民群众的愤怒。作为一个中国民主建国会负责人之一的我，有义务要向全国人民代表大会上特别说明中国民主建国会中间一个右派野心分子章乃器。
    大家都知道右派野心分子章乃器，在本年六月十九号给中国民主建国会跟全国工商业联合会两会联席会议决定：民建是“停止会内全部职务，责令检讨”，工商联是“停职检讨”。
    我现在把民建前前后后跟章乃器的斗争情况来向大家做一个简要的报告，让大家充分认识章乃器丑恶的真面目之后和我们一道来向章乃器在全国范围内继续展开坚决的斗争！
    代表们！大家已经知道：章乃器在国务院会上耍尽刁滑手法，对总理口出不逊，拒绝一切批评，硬说自己很好（写在六月二十八日大公报上）。章乃器在四川小组会上摆出资产阶级的臭架子，出言蛮横，表现了令人不能容忍的、极端恶劣态度（写在七月三日人民日报上）。代表们！那里知道章乃器这种刁滑、蛮横、恶劣在民建会场上、小组上，这些已经是“家常便饭”了。
    章乃器从前在民建所担任的职务是中央常务委员会副主任委员。他的言论在广大的工商界中是有他的一定影响的。章乃器自解放以来，曾经长期地利用他在民建的地位，对工商界散布了很多的毒素。民建许多同志曾经长期地跟他展开了斗争。斗争是很早展开的。到现在大家进一步认识到我们对章乃器的斗争，简直是两条路线的斗争。章乃器不和我们同样走社会主义路线，而竟是走资本主义路线。
    大家都知道，中国民主建国会是一个以民族资产阶级分子为主要组成成员的民主党派。这一党派，在解放以后由于中国的革命已经进入了社会主义革命的阶段，它的主要政治任务，就是担负着在中国共产党领导下帮助资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作。还在这一改造工作的进行过程中间，同时帮助民族资产阶级分子的思想改造。总之，民建接受中国共产党领导的政治路线是一贯的。
    章乃器在民建政治路线上曾大闹过三次，小闹就一言难尽了
    但是，民建就在这一点上发生分歧了，主要就是章乃器。自解放以来，章乃器一贯地在民建领导层中间，跟许多同志闹意见，闹不团结。过去大家还不很了解他的意图，现在回想起来，深深地认识到他跟我们争的，除了他个人的领导地位等等以外，重点还是民建的政治路线问题。在我们的记忆中，章乃器自解放以来，一共在民建的政治路线问题上与我们大闹过三次，小闹一言难尽了。现在让我把三次怎样大闹简单地说一说：
    第一次是在一九五○年四月，那时刚解放不久，我们曾经商定把团结、扶助、教育、改造民族工商业者做会的主要任务。章乃器开头没有异议。后来忽然表示不同意。提出的问题是“谁团结、扶助、教育、改造他们呢？”他认为“这可能被解释为是某些先知先觉以至自命为积极分子的人们去团结一般落后的可怜的民族工商业者，去扶助、教育、改造他们”。因此他说：“民建是属于他们（指工商业者）的。革命知识分子和青年干部都只是为他们服务。”这样很明白，他就是不要本会在党的领导下，吸收革命知识分子与青年干部来协助工商业者进行改造，而只要本会变成一个纯粹的资产阶级政党。
    章乃器在当时，一方面在北京、天津各地到处演说，提倡工商业者要努力“剥削”，并把中国资本家的“剥削”加以美化，如说中国资本家的剥削乃是没有“剥削意识的剥削”等。一方面又在会内强调知识分子必须不耻于为资产阶级服务等等。在章乃器的心目中从来没有民建会是在党的领导下担任对资产阶级分子的改造工作这一想法。当然，章乃器这些见解，是不可能不遭到我们会内的多数同志们的反对的。在“三反”的时候，许多同志给予很严厉的批判。但章乃器却毫不表示悔改。
    第二次是一九五五年，民建召开第一次全国代表大会，章乃器又跟我们在政治路线问题上发生了严重的争执。这就是当时他所提出的“红色资产阶级政党”问题。
  “红色”两字，是代表革命的，是属于常识范围的。中国民族资产阶级到了社会主义的革命阶段，作为阶级来说，已经是一个要被消灭的阶级，怎么可以再用“红色”两字来代表它？章乃器不应该不知道，他的所以要在当时提出这个口号，显然是在他心目中，中国的民族资产阶级是一个不需要改造的阶级，更谈不到是一个需要被消灭的阶级。他想把中国民主建国会，看成是一个“红色资产阶级政党”，来借此与红色的工人阶级政党分庭抗礼，这种意图还不够明显吗！民建会员同志们头脑是清醒的。章乃器这个口号一提出，跟他在一九五○年一样，立刻遭到了绝大多数会员同志们的反对。但章乃器也依然毫不觉悟。
    第三次是一九五六年本会召开一届二中全会的时候，章乃器又开始提出了一系列的荒谬理论，来反对资产阶级接受社会主义改造。主要就是有关中国民族资产阶级两面性问题跟工人阶级的关系问题。
    一九五六年章乃器在民建一届二中全会上最初说中国的民族资产阶级在全行业公私合营以后，已经没有所谓“两面性”了。后来又说资产阶级的“两面性”是与工人阶级一样的。仅仅只是“先进”与“落后”的“两面性”。此外，他又放肆地丑化中国的工人阶级，丑化共产党员，借以挑拨工商业者接受工人阶级（通过共产党）的领导。民建一届二中全会，为此曾严正地批驳了章乃器这些谬论，并且郑重地作出决议，说明中国民族资产阶级的两面性在资本主义工商业全行业公私合营后依然还是存在的。虽然它的内容与表现形式已经与过去有所不同。但资产阶级与工人阶级在本质上显然还是不能相提并论的。会议更特别强调了我国的人民民主专政在实质上是无产阶级专政的一种形式。因此对于中国共产党提出的长期共存、互相监督的方针，决不能理解为与任何资本主义制度下的“民主政治”有什么本质相同之处，决不能理解为我们可以与中国共产党分庭抗礼！我们认为任何离开了社会主义原则的，对这一方针的曲解都是错误的。从今天看来，我们当时的这些论点不仅仅是对章乃器，而是对今天所有右派分子的论点，都是针锋相对。
    整风开始后，章乃器继续猖狂向党进攻，成为一小撮反对走社会主义道路的人的代表
    民建二中全会几个决议，向全体会员中作了传达后，是取得多数会员同志们的拥护的。但章乃器并不甘心于他的失败，在二中全会后，不但仍然继续坚持他的荒谬论点，并索性进一步地歪曲毛主席的言论，把工人阶级亦说成还有两面性的阶级，借此来混同资产阶级与工人阶级之间的区别，不承认中国民族资产阶级的改造是“脱胎换骨”的改造。当然，章乃器的所以要在资产阶级“两面性”等等问题上大做文章，目的是在抗拒党对民族资产阶级分子的改造工作，也就是章乃器反对党的领导，这当然是由来已久的事情。但过去还比较隐蔽，自苏共二十次代表大会后，在检查统战部工作的时候，他的反党态度乘机暴露起来了。
    今年党的整风运动开始后，章乃器除继续散布过去原有的许多荒谬论点外，还更加露骨地对党猖狂进攻起来。如他在人民日报上所发表的“从‘墙’与‘沟’的思想基础说起”一篇文章中间，公然地曲解斯大林所说的党员乃是特殊材料造成的话的本意，在实质上反对党员乃是工人阶级的先锋队的作用。他更提出了反对“大党主义”，反对党组织“上前台”等口号，排斥党对民主党派的领导，党对一切行政工作的领导。和储安平的“党天下”思想，可以说没有两样。
    章乃器不但自己反对党，还鼓动工商业者一道来反对党。装成一个对工商业者的同情者的样子，在六月号的工商界月刊中所发表的“关于中国民族资产阶级的两面性问题”一篇文章中间，竟打起了反教条主义官僚们的旗帜，直接对主张今天的工商业者还有两面性的党的领导同志们作了最恶毒的攻击。章乃器又在“关于工商改造辅导工作的几个问题”一篇文章中间，提出了“官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人”这样的口号来一面歌颂资本主义，一面丑化社会主义。
    由此可见章乃器所打算走的道路，是确确实实与我们所走的道路相反的。因为我们所走的是社会主义道路，所以愈深入一步，愈感觉有更加着重改造自己的必要，有更加靠拢党的必要。而章乃器正相反。愈深入一步，愈要起来反对党的领导，愈要起来反对接受社会主义改造。这正说明了社会发展规律，当绝大多数中国的民族工商业者都愿意接受党的领导而走向社会主义道路的时候，定会有那么一小撮人起来反对走这条社会主义的道路——而章乃器正是这一小撮人的代表。
    接受社会主义改造和党的领导这个政治路线决不许改变
    根据上面所说，我们可以看出章乃器所以成为右派野心分子，绝不是偶然的，也绝不是突如其来的。过去外面的人不了解，认为民建内部长期闹不团结、闹宗派，今天大家明白了，完全不是别的，就是两条路线的斗争，就是接受社会主义改造跟不接受社会主义改造的斗争，接受党的领导跟不接受党的领导的斗争。在这里我要特别提出由于党一贯地正确领导和帮助，我们绝大多数民建会员包括不少工商业者的愿意靠拢党与接受党的领导，所以民建自解放以来，虽然在工作上存在着不少的缺点和错误，还不曾为了受到章乃器谬论的影响，迷失了我们政治方向，甚至发生民建政治路线的变化。这是应该向全国人民告慰的。今后敢于向大会保证民建永远跟中国共产党走。
    章乃器恶劣的品质，凶狠的行为和他为了反党、反社会主义而使用的种种卑鄙的手法，我们正在一步进一步地揭发和分析。在这里所要说明的，只是我在参加了对于像章乃器这样一个右派野心分子的斗争之后，有一点新的感悟，就是：我过去囫囵吞枣地只记住了“团结、批评、团结”，这个原则。现在我进一步体会到毛主席新的指示“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结”。这点值得细细回味。什么叫做“新的基础”呢？从民建一大群会员同志们长期跟章乃器斗争，总无法达到团结这一件事情看来，这达不到的“新的基础”，就是共同的政治基础。彼此走的路线已经是两条了，还会达到共同的政治基础吗？毛主席报告中间还有一句精辟的指示：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”大家想：灵魂都没有了，还能和他建立共同政治基础吗？还能和他团结吗？民建同志们多少年来为了章乃器，前前后后，不知用了多少忍耐工夫，多少说服方法，终于达不到团结，现在得到毛主席的指示了。代表们！在座不少友党、友团，有的正在展开整风工作，有的和我们民建同样地正在打击右派野心分子，民建愿把这斗争经验倾筐倒箧地贡献出来，让大家参考。
    对章乃器的斗争是整个反右派斗争的一环，不达目的，决不收兵
    章乃器问题，乃至一切右派分子问题，已经不是什么个别的人的问题，而是我们国家内部在社会主义改造过程中间出现了一小撮反社会主义、反党的小集团的问题。这些右派分子实际上是彼此在互相呼应、互相支援的。就章乃器来说，他公然支持储安平，公然要章伯钧“不投降”，一切都写明在报纸上。这就说明我们今天对章乃器所展开的斗争，就是整个反对右派斗争中间的重要一环。
    现在以章乃器为代表的资产阶级右派分子，反党、反社会主义的真面目是已经赤裸裸地暴露出来了。但在他影响下的右派分子，各地依然存在着。我们必须提高警惕，在全国范围内将这一反右派的革命斗争，继续扩大展开，彻底地进行下去，这是一场严肃的阶级斗争，我们拥护党、拥护社会主义的人民群众，站稳立场，坚决地参加作战，不达目的，决不收兵。
    代表们！我们都是亲身参加制订宪法的。我个人是抱着莫大的信心，坚决认定在中国共产党领导下，由工人阶级领导，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度，一定能够通过和平的道路，消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的。我们所掌握的是真理，这真理已经逐渐地为广大的人民群众所接受，而成为不可抗的力量。这力量表现在那里呢？表现在一般人口头常说的八个字：“大势所趋，人心所向。”这一小撮右派野心分子包括章乃器，妄想兴风作浪，结果将成一个泡沫罢了，我相信经过这一场反右派斗争，不但民建和各友党、友团都会争取到更多的忠诚地信仰中国共产党的同志，更有力地参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造，同时还将看到广大的全国人民的团结更加巩固。
    让我们一切拥护中国共产党、拥护毛泽东主席的人民都在这一场伟大的反右派斗争胜利中间团结起来！
    坚决接受中国共产党领导！
    坚决走社会主义道路！
