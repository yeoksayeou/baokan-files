Following the Sino-Soviet combined mountaineering team's conquest of Mount Muztagata, located in our Xinjiang territory at an altitude of 7,546 meters above sea level, last year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions organized China's first high-altitude exploration team this year in April. This young climbing team, with unparalleled perseverance, overcame numerous difficulties and on June 13th reached the summit of Mount Gongga in western Sichuan, at an altitude of 7,590 meters above sea level, winning glorious honor for the motherland. We express our heartfelt congratulations on the climbing team's success.

Mountaineering is a very good sport. In addition to promoting human health and cultivating courage and perseverance, it has special effects not found in general sports projects, such as enriching scientific knowledge and supporting economic construction.

Mountaineers living and training in the complex and changeable high-mountain environment inevitably encounter various serious difficulties. For example, to climb a high mountain, they often have to carry 25 to 30 kilograms of food and equipment, climb steep rocks, pass through narrow ridges or "snow bridges," cross rapid mountain streams, cross glaciers, fight against storms, and overcome severe cold and intense ultraviolet reflections. To overcome these extraordinary difficulties, mountaineers must not only possess abundant physical strength, agile physical ability, good endurance, and speed, but also have highly courageous, tenacious, hard-working, united, friendly qualities, and a spirit of collectivism. The process of overcoming various difficulties is the process of cultivating the all-round development of mountaineers, and it is also the process of conducting communist education for them.

Mountaineering is closely related to scientific research. Mountaineers often use their climbing skills, courage, and wisdom to climb various high mountains and steep peaks that are not easily accessible to ordinary people, explore the rich resources of the motherland's mountainous areas, and provide scientists with various research materials. Therefore, mountaineers are powerful assistants to scientists. Soviet mountaineers have made great contributions in this regard. Last year, when the Sino-Soviet combined mountaineering team climbed Mount Muztagata, they corrected the map of the Mount Muztagata area and collected many rock and plant specimens and took many photos of glaciers and snow mountains without scientists' guidance and necessary instruments. These materials are of great help in studying the geological age and climate of the mountainous area and mountain range, and therefore aroused great interest among relevant scientists in Beijing. This year, Peking University and Beijing Agricultural University sent three outstanding young scientists to participate in the climbing of Mount Gongga to guide scientific research. This shows that China's mountaineering movement has been combined with scientific research from the very beginning. We hope that more scientists will participate in mountaineering in the future, develop high-altitude scientific research, and serve our country's economic construction.

Mountaineering is also of great benefit to aviation, geological exploration, and other construction work. Mountaineers can climb steep high mountains not only because they have unwavering perseverance and have mastered climbing techniques and protection methods, but also because they have gained high-altitude adaptation through training. Last year, after four Chinese team members of the Sino-Soviet climbing team completed their mountaineering mission and returned to Beijing, they conducted experiments in the air pressure chamber of the Air Force Research Institute. They rose from the ground to an altitude of 9,020 meters above sea level (staying for ten minutes), and the ascent and descent took about four hours. They also performed intelligence tests (arithmetic problems, etc.) during the ascent, and their reactions were generally normal. According to aviation physiology research, altitudes of 6,000 to 8,000 meters can cause people to lose their ability to work, become unconscious, and even die. Aviation personnel generally need to wear oxygen when ascending to altitudes above 6,000 meters. High-altitude adaptation training for aviation personnel is very important, and mountaineering is one of the best training methods. At that time, the Chinese team members also received many letters from geological exploration workers and surveying and mapping workers, requesting them to introduce knowledge about high-altitude adaptation training, mountaineering techniques and protection methods, and methods for selecting mountaineering routes and identifying ice cracks. It can be seen that conducting training on mountaineering knowledge and techniques among geological exploration personnel and other people working in mountainous areas is of great significance.

Climbing Mount Gongga is an exploratory activity, the main purpose of which is to explore high-altitude secrets and engage in high-altitude scientific research. This type of mountaineering activity has certain risks. In addition, there is also a more mass-oriented mountaineering activity for the purpose of active rest and physical exercise. These two types of activities are combined with each other. China is a mountainous country, and most of the world's famous peaks above 8,000 meters are located within our borders, which have long been longed for by mountaineers from various countries. After the Sino-Soviet mountaineers climbed Mount Muztagata last year, it attracted widespread attention internationally. At the same time, organizations from five or six countries have successively requested to come to China for mountaineering or to exchange information on high-altitude scientific research. This situation requires us to gain experience in high-altitude climbing and high-altitude scientific research as soon as possible, so that it may be possible to gradually conquer our country's famous mountains and peaks in the future. This is a matter of our motherland's dignity and honor.

Four comrades of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions climbing team unfortunately sacrificed in the process of completing the task of climbing Mount Gongga. They dedicated their precious lives for the honor of the motherland, and we feel extremely grieved. At the same time, their noble qualities of courage, perseverance, and self-sacrifice have educated us. In order to commemorate them, we should seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of this mountaineering and gradually carry out mass mountaineering activities in our country.

    祝攀登贡嘎山的胜利
    蔡树藩
    继去年中苏混合爬山队征服我国新疆境内的拔海七千五百四十六公尺的慕士塔格山之后，今年4月中华全国总工会组织了我国第一支高山探险队。这支年青的爬山队，以无比的毅力，战胜了重重困难，在6月13日登上了四川西部拔海七千五百九十公尺的贡嘎山顶峰，为祖国争得了光辉的荣誉。我们对爬山队的成功，表示衷心地祝贺。
    爬山运动是个很好的运动项目，它除了能促进人体健康和培养人们勇敢、毅力以外，在丰富科学知识和支援经济建设等方面，有一般体育项目所没有的特殊作用。
    爬山运动员在复杂多变的高山环境里生活与锻炼，必然要碰到种种严重困难。例如为了登上高山往往要背上二十五到三十公斤重的食品与装备，攀登陡峭的岩石，通过狭窄的山脊或“雪桥”，穿过山间急流，跨过冰河，与狂风暴雨搏斗，战胜严寒与紫外线的强烈反射。克服这些超乎寻常的困难，爬山运动员不仅要具备充沛的体力、机敏的体能、良好的耐力和速度，而且必须有高度的勇敢顽强、刻苦耐劳、团结友爱的品质和集体主义精神。而克服各种困难的过程，就是培养爬山运动员们全面发展的过程，也是向他们进行共产主义教育的过程。
    爬山运动与科学研究工作有密切关系。爬山运动员经常用自己的爬山技术、勇敢和智慧攀登各种常人所不易登上的高山峻岭，探索祖国山区丰富的资源，为科学家提供各种研究资料，因此爬山运动员是科学家有力的助手。苏联爬山运动员在这方面有很大贡献。去年中苏混合爬山队攀登慕士塔格山时，在没有科学家指导和必要的仪器的情况下，还校正了慕士塔格山山区地图，收集许多岩石、植物标本，拍摄了许多有关冰河、雪山的照片。这些资料对研究该山区、山脉的地质年代及气候有很大帮助。因此，引起北京科学界有关科学家们极大兴趣。今年，北京大学、北京农业大学更派了三位优秀的青年科学家参加攀登贡嘎山的活动，指导科学研究工作。这说明，我国爬山运动一开始就与科学研究工作结合起来了。我们希望今后有更多的科学家参加爬山运动，发展高山科学研究工作，为我国经济建设服务。
    爬山运动对航空、地质勘探等项建设工作也是大有好处的。爬山运动员能够登上险峻的高山，不仅因为他们具有坚韧不拔的毅力，和掌握了爬山技术与保护方法，更重要的是他们经过锻炼获得了高空适应能力。去年中苏爬山队有四名中国队员在完成登山任务回北京以后，在空军研究所气压舱中作了试验，他们从地面上升至拔海九千零二十公尺（停留十分钟），升降共约四小时，在上升过程中还作了智力测验（算术学题等），反应一般正常。根据航空生理学的研究，六千至八千公尺的高度能使人丧失工作能力，昏迷甚而死亡。航空人员一般升至六千公尺以上就要带氧气。航空人员高空适应性的锻炼是非常重要的，而登山就是很好的锻炼方法之一。中国队员当时还收到许多地质勘探工作人员和测绘工作人员的来信，要求向他们介绍有关高山适应性锻炼知识、登山技术与保护方法，以及选择登山路线和识别冰裂缝的方法等。由此可见，在地质勘探人员及其他山区工作的人员中进行有关爬山知识和技术的训练有着重要的意义。
    攀登贡嘎山是一种探险性质的活动，其主要目的是探索高山秘密及从事高山科学研究工作。这种登山活动有一定的危险性。另外还有一种以积极休息和锻炼身体为目的、更具有群众性的爬山活动。而这两种活动是互相结合的。我国是个多山的国家，世界上八千公尺以上的著名高峰，绝大多数在我国境内，已久为各国爬山家所向往。去年中苏爬山运动员登上慕士塔格山以后，更引起国际上的广泛注意；同时，有五、六个国家有关的组织曾先后提出要求到我国登山或交换有关高山科学研究工作资料。这一情况要求我们在攀登高山和高山科学研究工作方面尽快的取得经验，以便有可能将来逐步地征服我国各名山和高峰。这是关系到我们祖国的尊严和荣誉的问题。
    中华全国总工会爬山队在这次完成攀登贡嘎山任务的过程中有四位同志不幸牺牲，他们为了祖国的荣誉而献出了自己宝贵的生命，我们感到万分沉痛；同时，他们勇敢坚毅和自我牺牲的高尚品质，使我们得到了教育。为了纪念他们，应该认真总结此次登山的经验教训，并逐步地把我国群众性的爬山运动开展起来。
