The Sun's Myriad Rays Illuminate the Goblins and Monsters in the Cloudy Shadows
Tang Shengzhi's Speech

I fully endorse Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, Premier Zhou's government work report, and agree with other reports.

From Chairman Mao's speech to Premier Zhou's report, it has truly been an "unusual spring." The myriad rays of the rising sun have revealed the goblins and monsters lurking in the dark clouds, making people vigilantly aware of many things. Originally, the Chinese Communist Party proactively invited non-Party members to help with rectification, but the bourgeois right-wing elements seized the opportunity to ignite fires everywhere, engaging in anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist political conspiracy activities with an agenda, organization, and plan. Originally, it was about correctly handling contradictions among the people, but the bourgeois right-wing elements turned friendship into hostility, launching a frantic attack on the working class and the people of the whole country. The bourgeois right-wing elements, placing themselves within the people, violated the promise of accepting the leadership of the Communist Party and the constitution they personally raised their hands to pass, attempting to usurp leadership, shake the foundation of the country, and drag the standing-up China back to the slave status of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. The revolutionary martyrs, the people of the whole country, and all righteous patriots cannot agree with this sinful subversive activity of the right-wing elements.

A More Beautiful Future of the Motherland Lies Before Us

I am someone who came over from the reactionary ruling group, personally experiencing several historical stages since the Xinhai Revolution, and I have a deep understanding of the major changes in society. Comparing the old and new societies, comparing the old and new China, they are completely different worlds, simply not comparable. The darkness and sin of the past and the happiness and brightness of today make me deeply appreciate the difficulty of the people's entrepreneurship and the hardship of nation-building. We have finally been able to see such a good society today and live in such a lovely motherland, but the right-wing elements want to destroy our common cause and harm our children and grandchildren. They are truly insane and intolerable by heaven, reason, and the law of the land. The great, correct, and glorious Chinese Communist Party is the leading and core force of the Chinese people. It led the Chinese people to overthrow the three major enemies that had long oppressed them. It led the Chinese people to achieve the victory of the five major movements, basically completed the three major transformations, changed the thousands-year-old exploitative relations of production, and liberated the productive forces. It led the Chinese people to carry out socialist construction, realize the first Five-Year Plan, and do extremely glorious and great things that our predecessors had never done before. It led the Chinese people to transform the divided and chaotic old China, where the people had no rights, into an unprecedentedly unified people's democratic country.

"The more beautiful future of the motherland is right before us." Such a tremendous change, revolution, and construction are the greatest achievements created by the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people, worthy of the people's eternal and great praise. Why do the right-wing elements, like Dulles of the imperialists, categorically deny these facts that are before them? May I ask, which of the things the Communist Party has done violates the interests of the people? Which of them is not a great good thing for the sake of the people's interests? "Only socialism can save China." Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, no socialism, and nothing for the people. May I ask, what reason do the right-wing elements have to oppose this fact and truth that is before them? Industrialization, cooperativization, the Five-Year Plan, national unity, Sino-Soviet friendship, etc.—these great good things related to the happy life of our 600 million people and the long-term interests of our children and grandchildren are things the right-wing elements have never liked to talk about much, and if they do, it is reluctantly and deceptively. But "political design institute," "rehabilitation committee," "Party's world," "the bourgeoisie has no two sides," "Soviet aggression," etc.—these shameless common slanders of the imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries are things the right-wing elements relish. It can be seen that the bourgeois right-wing elements and the people have nothing in common politically or ideologically. The bourgeois right-wing elements have a common language with Dulles, but they have no common language with the working people. The right-wing elements speak of "love for the country," "support for the Communist Party," and "support for socialism," but in their hearts, they are "traitors," "anti-Communists," and "supporters of capitalism." They are not reconciled to the loss of "the country," communism, and the people being masters of their own affairs, and they still want to make a desperate struggle.

The People Like What the Rightists Oppose; The Rightists Support What the People Dislike

What the people want is a people's democratic dictatorship system led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, while what the rightists want is a capitalist bicameral system and a bourgeois "opposition party." They attempt to replace democratic centralism with "absolute democracy" and "alternating rule," and to replace the leadership of the working class with the leadership of the bourgeoisie.

What the people want is socialist legality and the eradication of counter-revolutionaries, while what the rightists want is the complete collection of Six Laws and the protection of counter-revolutionaries. They use "legality" as an excuse to negate the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and as an excuse to resist the Party's rectification, avenging the counter-revolutionaries. Their so-called "legality" is actually synonymous with shackling the hands and feet of the people and is a law to protect counter-revolutionaries.

What the people want is a socialist economic system, while what the rightists want is capitalist ownership. They deny socialist transformation, deny the superiority of cooperativization, deny that the bourgeoisie has two sides, and curse the Five-Year Plan for ruining things and the unified purchase and sale of grain for messing things up, attempting to remove public representatives and fix interest rates for twenty years in order to allow capitalism to be restored.

What the people want is the guiding ideology of Marxism-Leninism and socialist culture and education, while what the rightists want is the guiding ideology of bourgeois idealism and capitalist culture and education. They deny the Party's leadership over culture and science, deny the necessity of ideological remolding, and attempt to abolish the school Party committee system and Marxist-Leninist political classes, implementing so-called "professors governing the school" and "colleagues running the newspaper" in order to allow bourgeois ideology to run rampant freely.

What the people want is the People's Liberation Army to defend the motherland and protect the cause of socialist construction, while what the rightists want is some kind of "democratic joint army" to guard the borders, attempting to seize military power and split the motherland.

What the people want is great national unity, while what the rightists want is great national division. They sow discord between the Han people and minority nationalities, and they do not recognize the existence of minority nationalities, essentially wanting to protect Han chauvinism and negate the Party's nationality policy.

What the people want is the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance, while what the rightists want is to be friendly with American imperialism. They do not actively oppose American imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan, but vigorously oppose the Soviet Union's sincere and selfless assistance to our country and its noble international friendship, and oppose our assistance to other countries, attempting to replace proletarian internationalism with bourgeois nationalism.

What the people want is the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, while what the rightists want is Acheson's White Paper and Dulles's speech on China policy.

Clearly, the rightists oppose what the people like, and the rightists support what the people dislike. Aren't the rightists' loves and hates completely obvious? If we were to follow the rightists' proposals on politics, economics, culture, military affairs, nationalities, and diplomacy, what would be left for the people besides national subjugation and slavery? May I ask Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, Chen Mingshu, and Tan Tiwu, why are you doing this? Who exactly benefits from doing this? What are your intentions? You are fellow travelers of the imperialists and opponents of the people. We want to sternly warn you: The Chinese Communist Party represents the interests of the entire Chinese people and shares the same destiny and breath with the people of the whole country. Opposing the Communist Party is opposing the people. The leading position of the Chinese Communist Party has been affirmed by the people of the whole country, and the socialist road is what the people of the whole country are determined to follow to the end. No matter what individual or social group wants to overthrow these two things, they are enemies of the people and will be opposed by the people of the whole country. Today's world belongs to the people, and the people's world cannot be defeated by any enemy. The bourgeoisie eats the food of the workers and peasants, so they should honestly work for the workers and peasants and obey the workers and peasants. This is the most ordinary truth and the most practical politics. If they are not reconciled or unconvinced, the peasants' hoes and the workers' shovels are something no class enemy can withstand.

This is a Serious Political Issue

Judging from the materials that have been revealed, the reactionary speeches and sinful activities of the bourgeois right-wing elements today are not just general ideological problems but serious political issues. Because they are not ordinary or simple rightists but a united, organized, and lined-up right-wing group. The Zhang-Luo alliance is the nerve center of the entire right-wing organization. The right-wing group uses the democratic parties such as the China Democratic League and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party as political capital and the stubborn bourgeois elements who have lost their means of production and the bourgeois intellectuals who have not yet been transformed as the social foundation to establish a nationwide system of conspiracy activities. When the rectification began, the right-wing leaders "launched attacks" from above, and right-wing elements in various places responded from below, linking up and echoing each other. Judging from their program, steps, and methods, almost everything was the same across the country. This fully shows that this frantic attack by the right-wing group was not accidental but had been planned and prepared for a considerable period. The situation in Hunan is no exception. Du Maizhi, the actual person in charge of the Hunan Democratic League, was a backbone member of the Zhang-Luo right-wing group and one of Luo Longji's confidants. The Hunan Democratic League right-wing's activity plan was the local concretization of the Zhang-Luo alliance's political program. Their strategic policy of attacking the Party was also to unite the rightists, win over the middle, and isolate and attack the leftists. Under the guise of helping the Party with rectification, they emphasized great airing of views and great blooming, creating an atmosphere where only shortcomings and errors could be spoken of and achievements and merits were not allowed. Among people from all walks of life, at the provincial CPPCC conference, at five major universities, and within the organs of certain parties and groups, they ignited fires and fanned the flames everywhere, doing everything they could to slander, scold, fabricate rumors, and distort the truth, depicting the Communist Party as completely black and utterly useless. They blocked progressive elements from joining the Party and pulled some people with political and historical problems, those who were dissatisfied with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and even counter-revolutionaries into their organization, colluding with each other. They attacked, cursed, and vilified all Communist Party members and activists, saying that these people were "lackeys," "troublemakers," and "plainclothes police of the Kuomintang era." They cursed those who were close to the Communist Party as well, not allowing people to speak fairly, saying that speaking fairly was hindering "airing" and "blooming." They gave small favors to the middle people, trying their best to win them over and incite them to oppose the Party. They even openly asked the Party committee to withdraw from universities, proposed "anti-class theory," provoked relations between Party members, shouted to Communist Party members to "rebel," saying that "dictatorship has been imposed on the people," saying that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was a nationwide mistake," wanting the "Communist Party to rebuild the Party," wanting the "Communist Party and democratic parties to form a political party together," wanting to "expel those Communist Party members who should be expelled, imprison those who should be imprisoned, and execute those who should be executed." What Beijing was doing was the "rehabilitation committee," and in Hunan they wanted to establish a "post-suppression of counter-revolutionaries committee," to "grant amnesty" and "rehabilitate." What Beijing was doing was the Guangming Daily, and in Hunan they wanted to run a "colleague newspaper," gathering a group of old newspaper rascals, holding forums, and petitioning the provincial Party committee, so that they could "publicize" and "contend." Beijing had the Hundred Flowers Society, and Hunan had the Thawing Society. Beijing had Lin Xiling, Tan Tianrong, and others' "program," "declaration," "speech," and "flower bush whispers," and Hunan had Liu Guoping, Yang Jihua, and others' "twenty-four articles," "sincere words and insights," and "three stifled angers." In Beijing, someone secretly threw bombs, and in Hunan, someone openly beat workers and cadres, wanting "white knives in, red knives out." … Under the guise of opposing bureaucratism, they opposed the socialist system, saying that bureaucratism was a product and synonym of socialism. Under the guise of opposing sectarianism, they opposed the leadership of the Communist Party, saying that sectarianism was a product and synonym of the proletarian dictatorship. Under the guise of opposing dogmatism, they promoted revisionism and opposed Marxism-Leninism, saying that dogmatism was a product and synonym of Marxism-Leninism. Under the banner of "mutual supervision," they reactively sang "opposition plays" to the Party. This frantic attack by the right-wing group nationwide, in its malicious and insidious essence, is the American imperialists' "subversive activity" and the Taiwan reactionaries' "counterattack on the mainland."

The Rightists Had a Pipe Dream

The reason why the bourgeois right-wing elements are so rampant and vicious has its social roots, historical roots, and ideological roots. Originally, they had ulterior motives and were up to no good. They not only did not approve of the socialist revolution but also had long disapproved of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution. They were keen on bourgeois democracy and never forgot the middle road and the third force. Since their welcome to the new while seeing off the old was false in the past, of course, they are even more unwilling to transform themselves now. On the eve of the national liberation, the imperialist element Acheson, in his "helpless confession," pinned his hopes on this small group of "democratic individualists." The Chinese Communist Party earnestly advised the middle class, middle-of-the-roaders, and all those who were still wavering and hesitant within China at the time to "discard illusions and prepare for struggle." The vast majority of old intellectuals and old military and government personnel recognized the direction under the education of the Party and stood on the side of the masses of the people, but a few right-wing political careerists never changed their positions and discarded their illusions. They painstakingly planned, hid murderous intentions, and watched for changes in the world, so that once there was any movement, they could realize their dream of "competing with the Communist Party for the world" and re-enact a new Romance of the Three Kingdoms. In recent years, under the powerful power of the people, they did not dare to act rashly. Since the 20th Congress of the CPSU last year, and the subsequent events in Poland and Hungary, they thought that socialism was not working, Marxism-Leninism was useless, the alliance was anti-Communist, and they were eager to try. This year, when the CCP began its rectification, they thought that they had "capital," "knowledge," and "masses," and that the conditions for "launching an attack" were ripe, and that the time for "attacking" had matured. So, using helping the Chinese Communist Party with rectification as a guise and treating the handling of contradictions among the people as a shield, they planned in secret rooms, ignited fires at the grassroots level, developed organizations, incited the masses, with poisonous flames soaring to great heights and wreaking havoc in all directions. They attempted to first occupy the press, cultural, and education circles, and then seize other circles, using hot guns and cold arrows, "verbal attacks and written criticisms," launching a large-scale attack on the Communist Party, with wolves howling and ghosts screaming for a time, making the earth smoggy and difficult for honest people to breathe. The Party only temporarily refrained from counterattacking, based on the principle that the revolutionary consciousness of the masses should be cultivated in the wind and rain of struggle rather than in a greenhouse. They were convinced that the Communist Party was in trouble this time, unable to let things go further or rein them in, and even less able to use the army to suppress them. With no way to implement any of the three strategies, they were in a dilemma, and in the end, they would have to ask our leader to come out and save the situation or clean up the mess. Even if they couldn't replace everything completely, they would have to divide the world into three parts, treating the people as a fool and making a joke out of history. In their drunken euphoria, they were proud and complacent, thinking that "the only heroes in the world are Zhang and Luo." The oligarchs of the Atlantic and the clowns of Taiwan were also unwilling to be lonely, doing their best to cheer them on from the sidelines. Dulles even fantasized that China would "disappear" from then on, frequently paying his respects to these "individualists." The oligarch gentlemen of the right, you are wrong to be happy. You have overestimated your own magical powers and underestimated the power of the people of the whole country to support the Communist Party and defend socialism. You fantasize that your sinful activities will win over the masses and win the sympathy of society. That is simply a pipe dream!

Confessing Their Crimes to the People of the Whole Country is the Only Way Out for the Rightists

The bourgeois right-wing figures are the anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist bourgeois reactionaries. These figures are not right only today; they have been consistently right throughout history. They have always been peddlers who watch the political market and make political calculations. Supporting the Communist Party, serving the people, and taking the socialist road are all lies to them. There is no falsehood in class struggle. The bourgeoisie is eliminated, and the proletariat is victorious. This is history. Historical negative figures—class enemies at every historical stage—are always looking for opportunities to express themselves. If they don't expose themselves today, they will expose themselves tomorrow; if they don't expose themselves now, they will expose themselves in the future. The leading figures of the bourgeois right-wing are no exception today. When their ugly faces had not yet been exposed, when their guise of being patriotic and progressive and mixed among the people had not yet been stripped away, the people treated them very favorably, giving them high positions and entrusting them with important tasks, not remembering old grievances and not blaming the past, hoping that they would do some good things for the people and continue to do so consistently. But people do not know shame, and horses do not know how long their faces are. These political careerists not only did not think about repaying the favor, but they even forgot their gratitude and became complacent and out of control, wanting to settle old scores, bring down the Communist Party, and overthrow socialism. They don't think about how much blood debt and old scores they owe the people. They don't think about who gave them the positions of representatives, committee members, and ministers. What are the people giving them the positions of representatives, committee members, and ministers for? Leaving the leadership of the Communist Party and violating socialist principles, what good can they do? For these masters who still want to ride on the heads of the people, the representatives of the people of the whole country have the right, obligation, and responsibility to hold them accountable, and they must answer: What exactly are you doing? We sternly warn all right-wing elements! You have already stepped onto the dangerous road pointed out by the imperialists. If you do not exclude yourselves from the united front and do not cut yourselves off from the people, then you must rein in on the edge of the cliff, honestly and thoroughly confess your crimes to the people of the whole country, and give a frank account, otherwise there is no way out.

The Most Basic Lesson I Learned From This Anti-Rightist Struggle

I, too, have committed crimes against the people in history, and I have not done many good things for the people. But the patriotic conscience, the sense of justice, and the education of the Communist Party and the working people have made me understand where the hearts of the people are today and the general trend of events. I admit my guilt, accept the situation, give up, and truly surrender to the people. I sincerely support socialism and honestly accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Therefore, the people still give me the opportunity to serve today and help me to pursue progress and understand the truth. I am not saying that my thinking is brilliant. I know that my level is limited, and I am far from making a fundamental change in my worldview, but I am determined and confident to gradually complete this change. The most basic lesson I have learned from this anti-rightist struggle is that we must strengthen ideological remolding. If we do not constantly be vigilant and pay attention to whether we have firmly stood on the socialist position in our thinking, then it will be difficult to avoid being influenced and used by the rightists, and we will unconsciously produce words and deeds that are detrimental to socialism. We must admit that the bourgeoisie has two sides, and bourgeois intellectuals also have two sides. We have already experienced the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution. Through the five major movements and the three major transformations, we have made progress, but on the ideological front, judging and examining ourselves with the six political criteria of Chairman Mao's speech, I think our ideological remolding is very insufficient and not very adapted to today's revolutionary situation and political position. I believe that breaking capitalism, establishing socialism, striving to increase the socialist side, and minimizing the capitalist side, "gradually establishing a communist worldview, gradually learning Marxism-Leninism well, and gradually integrating with workers and peasants," remains a serious task for bourgeois and bourgeois intellectuals to continue self-transformation.

This anti-rightist struggle is essentially an unavoidable struggle of who will defeat whom between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in politics and ideology. It is a struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology, and a struggle between the socialist line and the capitalist line, which is related to the future of our motherland and the future of the people. Any individual or group that supports socialism should actively participate in this struggle. Wolves always want to eat people. Any leniency towards the rightists is cruelty towards the people.

Comrades and friends of all democratic parties! This anti-rightist struggle is a great opportunity for us to further transform ourselves. We must firmly stand on the socialist position and fight against the rightists, ruthlessly exposing and criticizing the rightists, and defending the interests of socialism, and defeat the rampaging rightists. Through this struggle, we will examine our own positions, viewpoints, and thoughts and feelings, and undergo a profound test of class struggle and socialist education, so that we can rectify the style of our democratic parties, continue to truly help the Chinese Communist Party with rectification, and thereby achieve true unity based on common language on the basis of socialism. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will continue to consolidate and develop our great people's democratic united front and rapidly advance the construction of our great motherland along the socialist path.

专栏：

    旭日的万丈光芒照射出阴云里的魑魅魍魉
    唐生智的发言
    我完全拥护毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲演、周总理的政府工作报告，同意其他各项报告。
    从主席讲演到总理报告这一段时期，真是一个“不平常的春天”，旭日东升的万丈光芒透视着乌云阴霾里面的魑魅魍魉，使人们警觉地认识了许多东西。本来是中国共产党主动地请党外人士帮助整风，而资产阶级右派分子却乘机到处点火，有纲领有组织有计划地进行反共反人民反社会主义的政治阴谋活动；本来是正确地处理人民内部矛盾，而资产阶级右派分子却反友为敌，向工人阶级和全国人民发动了猖狂的进攻。资产阶级右派分子置身人民内部，竟违背接受共产党领导的诺言，违背亲自举手通过的宪法，妄图篡夺领导，动摇国本，想把站起来的中国重新拉回到半封建半殖民地的奴隶地位，对于右派分子这种罪恶的颠复活动，革命的先烈不答应，全国人民不答应，一切正义的爱国人士都不能答应。
    我们面前是祖国更加美好的将来
    我是从反动统治集团起义过来的人，亲身经历了辛亥革命以来的几个历史阶段，对社会的大变动是有深刻感受的。对比一下新旧社会，对比一下新旧中国，那完全是两个不同的世界，简直不可以同日而语。过去的黑暗罪恶，今日的幸福光明，使我亲切体会到人民创业之不易，建国之艰难。我们好容易能看到有今天这样好的社会，生活在这样可爱的祖国，而右派分子竟想破坏我们共同的事业，危害我们的儿孙后代，真是丧心病狂，天理国法之所不容。伟大的、正确的、光荣的中国共产党是中国人民的领导力量和核心力量，他领导中国人民打倒了长期压在人民头上的三大敌人；他领导中国人民取得了五大运动的胜利，基本上完成了三大改造，改变了几千年来人剥削人的生产关系，解放了生产力；他领导中国人民进行社会主义建设，实现第一个五年计划，做着我们前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业；他领导中国人民把分裂混乱的人民无权的旧中国改变成为空前统一的人民民主国家。
  “祖国的更加美好的将来，正摆在我们面前”。这样翻天复地的大转变，大革命，大建设，正是中国共产党领导中国人民所创造出来的最伟大的成绩，值得人民永远的大大的歌颂。为什么右派分子和帝国主义杜勒斯一样，矢口否认摆在他们面前的这些事实呢？试问共产党所做的事，有那一件事违背了人民的利益？有那一件事不是为人民利益着想的大好事？“只有社会主义能够救中国”，没有共产党就没有新中国，就没有社会主义，就没有人民的一切。试问右派分子有什么理由来反对摆在他们面前的这个事实和真理呢？工业化、合作化、五年计划、民族团结、中苏友好等等，这些关系我们六亿人民幸福生活和我们儿孙后代长远利益的大好事，右派分子从来是不大喜欢讲的，要讲也是勉强的，骗人的。而什么“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”、“党天下”、“资产阶级没有两面性”、“苏联侵略”等等，这些帝国主义、蒋介石反动派的无耻的共同谰言，右派分子却津津乐道。可见资产阶级右派分子和人民在政治上思想上是没有任何共同点的。资产阶级右派分子和杜勒斯有共同的语言，而和劳动人民是没有任何共同语言的。右派分子口里讲“爱国”、“拥共”、“拥护社会主义”，骨子里却是“叛国”、“反共”、“拥护资本主义”，对亡“国”、共产、人民当家作主不甘心，还想作垂死的挣扎。
    人民所喜欢的东西，右派反对；人民不喜欢的东西，右派拥护
    人民要的是以工人阶级为领导以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政制度，要的是
  中国共产党的领导，而右派分子要的却是资本主义两院制，要的是资产阶级的“反对党”，他们企图以“绝对民主”“轮流执政”来代替民主集中，以资产阶级的领导来代替工人阶级的领导。
      人民要的是社会主义法制，肃清反革命，而右派分子要的却是六法全书，保护反革命。他们借口“法制”来否定肃反，借口“法制”来对抗党的整风，为反革命复仇，他们的所谓“法制”，实际上就是束缚人民群众手脚的同义语，就是保护反革命的法。
    人民要的是社会主义的经济制度，而右派分子要的却是资本主义所有制，他们否认社会主义改造，否认合作化的优越性，否认资产阶级有两面性，骂五年计划搞坏了，骂粮食统购统销搞糟了，企图撤掉公方代表，定息二十年，好让资本主义复辟。
    人民要的是马克思列宁主义的指导思想和社会主义的文化教育，而右派分子要的却是资产阶级唯心主义的指导思想和资本主义的文化教育。他们否认党对文化科学的领导，否认思想改造的必要性，企图取消学校党委制和马列主义政治课，实行什么“教授治校”“同人办报”，好让资产阶级思想自由泛滥。
    人民要的是人民解放军，保卫祖国，保卫社会主义建设事业，而右派分子要的却是什么“民主联军”守边防，企图争取兵权，分裂祖国。
    人民要的是民族大团结，而右派分子要的却是民族大分裂，他们挑拨汉族与少数民族关系，不承认有少数民族，实质上是想保护大汉族主义，否定党的民族政策。
    人民要的是中苏友好同盟，而右派分子要的却是同美帝国主义亲善，他们不积极反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾，而极力反对苏联对我国的真诚无私的援助和崇高的国际友谊，反对我们援助别的国家，企图以资产阶级的民族主义来代替无产阶级的国际主义。
    人民要的是中华人民共和国宪法和毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲演，而右派分子要的却是美国艾奇逊的白皮书和杜勒斯对华政策的演说。
    显然，人民所喜欢的东西，右派分子反对，人民所不喜欢的东西，右派分子拥护，右派分子的爱爱仇仇，岂不是昭然若揭。假若按照右派分子的政治、经济、文化、军事、民族、外交各方面的主张做去，除了亡国做奴隶之外，人民还有什么？试问章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、龙云、黄绍竑、陈铭枢、谭惕吾，你们这样做是为甚么？这样做究竟对谁有利？你们是何居心？你们是帝国主义的同路人，人民的反对者。我们要严正警告你们：中国共产党代表全中国人民的利益，和全国人民同命运，共呼吸，反对共产党就是反对人民。中国共产党的领导地位是全国人民肯定了的，社会主义的道路是全国人民坚定不移要走到底的，不论任何个人或任何社会集团，要想推翻这两条，就是人民的公敌，就要遭到全国人民的反对。今天的天下是人民的天下，人民的天下是任何敌人也打不垮的。资产阶级吃工人农民的饭，就应该为工人农民老老实实做事，就得规规矩矩服工人农民的管，这是最平凡的真理，也是最实际的政治，不甘心，不服气，农民的锄头，工人的铁锹，任何阶级敌人都是受不了的。
    这是严重的政治问题
    从已经揭露的材料来看，今天资产阶级右派分子的反动言论和罪恶活动，绝不是什么一般思想问题，而是严重的政治问题。因为他们并不是平常的、简单的右派，而是联合起来的有组织有路线的右派集团，章罗联盟就是整个右派组织的神经中枢。右派集团以民盟、农工民主党等民主党派为政治资本，以失掉了生产资料的顽固的资产阶级分子和尚未改造过来的资产阶级知识分子为社会基础，建立了一个遍布全国的阴谋活动系统。整风一来，右派首脑人物“发难”于上，各地右派分子响应于下，上下串连，八方呼应，从他们的纲领、步骤、作法来看，全国各地几乎是一模一样，这就充分说明右派集团这一次猖狂进攻并不是偶然的，而是有相当时期的部署和准备的。湖南的情况也不例外，湖南民盟的实际负责人杜迈之，便是章罗右派集团的一个骨干，是罗隆基的亲信之一，湖南民盟右派的活动计划就是在地方上具体化了的章罗联盟的政治纲领。他们向党进攻的战略方针也是采取了团结右派、争取中间、孤立和打击左派的策略，在帮助党整风的名义之下，强调大放大鸣，造成一种只许讲缺点错误，不许讲成绩优点的空气，在社会各阶层人士中间，在省政协会议上，在五个大专学校，在某些党派团体机关内部到处点火扇风，极尽污蔑、谩骂、造谣歪曲的能事，把共产党描写得漆黑一团，一无是处，他们阻拦进步分子入党，而把一些有政治历史问题、对肃反不满的、甚至反革命分子拉进他们的组织，串通声气。凡是共产党员和积极分子，他们就加以攻击、咒骂、丑化，说这些人是“奴才”，是“害群之马”，是国民党时代的“便衣警察”；把靠近共产党的人，也骂得一塌糊涂；不让人们说公道话，说公道话就是阻碍“鸣”“放”；对中间的人便小恩小惠，极力拉拢，煽惑他们反党；甚至公开要党委退出高等学校，提出“反阶级论”，挑拨党员与党员的关系，向共产党员喊话，要他们“起义”，说“专政专到人民头上来了”，说“肃反是全国性的错误”，要“共产党重新建党”，要“共产党和民主党派合组政党”，要把共产党员“开除的开除，坐牢的坐牢，枪毙的枪毙”。北京搞的是“平反委员会”，他们在湖南就要搞“肃反善后委员会”，由他们来“大赦”“平反”，北京搞的是光明日报，他们在湖南就要办“同人报”，纠合一班旧的报痞子，开座谈会，向省委请愿，由他们来“宣传”“争鸣”。北京有百花社，湖南就有解冻社，北京有林希翎、谭天荣等的什么“纲领”“宣言”“讲演”“花丛小语”，湖南就有刘果平、杨继华等的什么“二十四条”“忠言和管见”“三透闷气”。北京有人秘密地扔炸弹，湖南就有人公开地打工人、打干部，要“白刀子进，红刀子出”。……他们在反对官僚主义的幌子下，反对社会主义制度，把官僚主义说成是社会主义的产物和代名词，他们在反对宗派主义的幌子下，反对共产党的领导，把宗派主义说成是无产阶级专政的产物和代名词，他们在反对教条主义的幌子下，宣传修正主义，反对马克思列宁主义，把教条主义说成是马克思列宁主义的产物和代名词。他们打着“互相监督”的旗号，反动地和党唱“对台戏”。右派集团在全国范围内的这种猖狂的进攻，其恶毒阴险的实质就是美帝国主义的“颠复活动”，台湾反动派的“大陆反攻”。
    右派分子作了一场白日梦
    资产阶级右派分子之所以这样的猖狂毒辣，是有其社会根源、历史根源和思想根源的。原来他们是早有企图别有用心的，他们不但是不赞成社会主义革命，而且也早就不赞成反帝反封建的民主革命。他们热中于资产阶级民主，念念不忘中间路线和第三势力。他们过去送旧迎新既然是假的，现在要脱胎换骨当然就更不甘心。全国解放前夕，帝国主义分子艾奇逊在他
  “无可奈何的供状”里，就曾寄希望于这一小撮“民主个人主义”的拥护者，中国共产党曾苦口婆心地劝告过当时中国内部的中间阶层、中间派和一切还在动摇犹豫着的人们“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”，绝大多数的旧知识分子和旧军政人员在党的教育下都认清方向，站到人民大众方面来了，而少数右派政治野心家却始终没有改变他们的立场，丢掉他们的幻想。他们处心积虑，潜藏杀机，窥伺天下之变，一旦有了动静，便好实现他们所梦想的“和共产党争天下”重演新的三国演义。几年来，在人民强大的威力下，他们还不敢轻举妄动，从去年苏共第二十次党代表大会以后，接连着发生波、匈事件，他们就以为社会主义不行了，马列主义不中用了，联盟反共，跃跃欲试。今年中共整风，他们自以为有“资本”，有“知识”，有“群众”，“发难”的条件具备了，“进攻”的时机成熟了，于是借帮助中国共产党整风作幌子，拿处理人民内部矛盾作盾牌，密室策划，基层点火，发展组织，煽动群众，毒焰万丈，施虐四方，他们企图先占领新闻、文化、教育界，然后夺取其他各界，热枪冷箭，“口诛笔伐”，大举向共产党进攻，一时狼嗥鬼叫，搞得大地上乌烟瘴气。使正直的人们呼吸都感到有点困难。党只是根据群众革命的觉悟应该在斗争的风雨里培养而不应该在温室里培养的原则，暂时不给予回击，而他们满以为这一回共产党可不行了，既不能再放，又不能再收，更不能拿军队来镇压，三策莫施，进退维谷，到时就非求于我盟主出来挽救危局或者收拾残局不可，纵不能全部取而代之，少不得也要三分天下，把人民当阿斗，拿历史开玩笑，酒酣脑胀，踌躇满志，以为“天下英雄唯章与罗耳”。大西洋的寡头，台湾的小丑，也不甘寂寞，从旁极力打气喝彩，杜勒斯还幻想中国从此将要“消逝”，频频向这些“个人主义”者致意。右派的寡头先生们，你们高兴得错了，你们把自己的神通估计得太高了，把全国人民拥护共产党、保卫社会主义的力量估计得太低了。你们幻想你们的罪恶活动，会争取得到群众，会赢得社会的同情，那简直是白日做梦！
    向全国人民低头认罪是右派分子唯一的出路
    资产阶级右派人物，就是反共反人民反社会主义的资产阶级反动派，这一派人物，并不是今天才右，过去在历史上一贯地就是右，从来就是看政治行情打政治算盘的市侩，拥护共产党，为人民服务，走社会主义道路，对他们来说，全是假话。阶级斗争是没有假的，资产阶级消灭了，无产阶级胜利了，这就是历史。历史上的反面人物——各个历史阶段的阶级敌人，总是要寻找机会来表现他们自己的，今天不暴露，明天会暴露，现在不暴露，将来会暴露，今天资产阶级右派的首脑人物，并不例外。当他们丑恶的面貌尚未暴露的时候，当他们混在人民当中爱国进步的伪装还未被剥夺的时候，人民对他们是非常优遇的，待之以高位，委之以重任，不念旧恶，不咎既往，希望他们为人民做些好事并一贯地做下去。人不知廉耻，马不知脸长，这些政治野心家们不但不思有所报效，居然忘恩负义，得意忘形，反而想算老账，整垮共产党，打倒社会主义。他们不想想，他们欠了人民多少血债和老账，他们不想想，他们的代表、委员、部长是谁给他们当的？人民给他们当代表、委员、部长是干什么事的？离开了共产党的领导，违背了社会主义原则，他们能够做出一件什么好事？对于这些还想骑在人民头上的老爷，全国人民代表有权利有义务有责任向他们追究，而且一定要他们回答，你们究竟搞甚么？我们严正警告一切右派分子们！你们已经走到帝国主义所指引的危险道路上去了。如果你们不自外于统一战线，不自绝于人民，那就必须悬崖勒马，老老实实地彻底地向全国人民低头认罪，坦白交代，否则是没有任何出路的。
    从这次反右派斗争中我得到的最基本的教训
    我在历史上对人民也是有罪的，对人民也并没有做多少好事，但爱国的良心，正义的情感，共产党和劳动人民的教育，使我懂得今天的人心所向大势所趋，认罪，服气，死心，向人民真投降，诚诚恳恳拥护社会主义，老老实实接受共产党的领导，所以人民今天仍然给我以效力的机会，并且帮助我去追求进步，认识真理。我不是说我的思想就高明了，我自知水平有限，从世界观上来一个根本转变还差得很远，但我有决心有信心去逐步完成这个转变。在这次反右派的斗争中，我得到最基本的教训是：必须加强思想改造。如果不在思想上，时加警惕和注意自己是否站稳了社会主义立场，那就难保不受右派分子的影响和利用，就会不自觉地产生不利于社会主义的言行。我们必须承认，资产阶级有两面性，资产阶级知识分子也有两面性。我们已经经历了民主革命和社会主义革命，通过五大运动和三大改造，我们已经有了进步，但是在思想战线上，拿主席讲演的六项政治标准衡量检查一下，我认为我们的思想改造是很不够的，同我们今天的革命形势和政治地位还是很不适应的。我认为破资本主义，立社会主义，努力增多社会主义的一面，尽量减少资本主义的一面，“逐步地树立共产主义世界观，逐步地学好马克思列宁主义，逐步地同工人农民打成一片，”仍然是资产阶级、资产阶级知识分子继续自我改造的严重任务。
    这次反右派的斗争，实质上是无产阶级和资产阶级在政治上和思想上一场不可避免的谁战胜谁的斗争，是无产阶级思想与资产阶级思想的斗争，是社会主义路线与资本主义路线的斗争，关系着我们祖国的前途和人民的将来，拥护社会主义的任何个人和任何集团都应当积极投入这种斗争。狼总是要吃人的，对右派分子的任何姑息，都是对人民的残忍。
    各民主党派的同志们，朋友们！这次反右派的斗争，正是我们进一步改造自己的大好机会。我们必须坚定地站在社会主义立场上和右派分子进行斗争，无情地揭露和批判右派分子，捍卫社会主义的利益，把猖狂进攻的右派分子打下去。通过这次斗争，检查我们自己的立场观点和思想感情，接受一次深刻的阶级斗争考验和社会主义教育，这样，才能整好我们民主党派的风，才能继续真正帮助中国共产党整风，从而在社会主义的基础上达到有共同语言的真团结，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下继续巩固和发展我们伟大的人民民主统一战线，沿着社会主义的轨道，把我们伟大的祖国建设事业迅速向前推进。
