Oman, also known as Muscat and Oman, is composed of the Sultanate of Muscat and the Imamate of Oman. It is located on the southeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, near the entrance to the Persian Gulf, bordered by the Arabian Sea to the east, the Arabian Desert to the west, and Trucial Oman to the northwest. It covers an area of over 212,000 square kilometers. The capital is Muscat. The population is approximately 550,000, mostly Arabs, who adhere to Islam. There are also significant numbers of Baloch, West Indians, and Blacks.

Oman's terrain includes three types of regions: coastal plains, mountainous areas, and plateaus. Mountains extend all the way to the coast. There are no railways within the country. Approximately 400 kilometers of highways connect the coastal towns, while the interior relies on camel caravans. Oman's climate is very hot and dry, with considerable temperature variations inland and little rainfall.

Oman's economy is very backward, with only some primitive handicraft production. Dates are produced along the coast, while nomadic tribes in the desert regions raise camels.

Oman is an ancient country. Due to its location at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, occupying an important geographical position, it attracted the attention of colonialists early on. As early as 1508, the Portuguese invaded and occupied the Muscat area along the coast. In 1650, taking advantage of a major blow dealt to the Portuguese by the British in Persia, Arab tribes overthrew Portuguese rule and established the Yaruba dynasty. In the 1730s, Oman was conquered by the Persians. In 1741, Ahmed bin Said, from the Yemeni royal family, drove out the Persians and established control over Oman. In the late eighteenth century, Oman became a target for British and French rivalry. In 1798, the British East India Company and the Omani government signed their first treaty, granting Britain the right to establish businesses in Oman. In 1839 and 1891, Britain forced Oman to sign enslaving treaties, consolidating its control over Oman and excluding French influence. In 1939, Britain and Oman signed a "Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation," and in 1951, they signed another "Friendship" treaty, reaffirming Britain's enjoyment of various privileges in Oman for over a century, turning Oman into a British protectorate.

The colonialists' invasion and plunder of Oman aroused resolute resistance from the Omani people. As early as the late nineteenth century, various Omani tribes launched large-scale uprisings. In 1913, the independent Imamate of Oman was established within Oman, with Nizwa as its capital, refusing to recognize British rule. In 1920, the Treaty of Seeb was signed, with the Sultanate of Muscat recognizing the independence of Oman. However, in December 1955, under British command, the Muscat Sultan's army invaded the Imamate of Oman, occupying Nizwa and other places. Imam Ghalib bin Ali of Oman had to flee from Nizwa, but he resolutely rejected the British ultimatum, declaring that he would forever defend his country and demanding that other Arab countries support him in driving out the British colonialists. With British support, the Sultan of Muscat established control over the Imamate of Oman. Subsequently, the local people repeatedly attacked British airfields to oppose British rule.

In 1949, rich oil deposits were discovered near the Buraimi Oasis in the northeast of the Imamate of Oman. Because Oman and Saudi Arabia did not have a clear boundary in the Buraimi region, the issue of sovereignty over the Buraimi Oasis had not been resolved. Britain, under the guise of Oman's "protectorate," attempted to seize the region, while the United States, which had obtained oil exploration rights in Saudi Arabia, also coveted the oil resources of the Buraimi Oasis, and therefore actively supported Saudi Arabia in acquiring the Buraimi Oasis. In the past, Britain had repeatedly instructed the Sultan of Muscat to invade Oman, reflecting the contradictions between the Anglo-American oil monopoly groups in their struggle for oil.

    阿曼
    阿曼，又叫马斯喀特和阿曼，是由马斯喀特苏丹国和阿曼伊斯兰教长国组成的。它位于阿拉伯半岛的东南端，靠近波斯湾的入口处，东临阿拉伯海；西与阿拉伯大沙漠接壤，西北和特鲁西尔阿曼相邻。面积有二十一万二千多平方公里。首都是马斯喀特。人口约五十五万，大部分是阿拉伯人，信仰伊斯兰教，也有不少俾路支人、西印度人和黑人。
    阿曼的地形包括三种地区：沿海平原、山脉地带和高原。山岭一直延伸到海边。境内没有铁路，联系着沿海各城镇的汽车公路约四百公里，与内地连系则依靠骆驼队。阿曼的气候非常炎热和干燥，内地温度的变化相当大，雨量很少。
    阿曼的经济很落后，只有一些原始的手工业生产。沿海出产大枣，在沙漠地区的游牧部落则饲养骆驼。
    阿曼是一个古国。由于它位于波斯湾入口处，占据重要的地理条件，它很早就引起了殖民者的注意。远在1508年，葡萄牙人便侵占了沿海的马斯喀特一带。1650年，阿拉伯部落趁英国在波斯给予葡萄牙人重大打击时，推翻了葡萄牙人的统治，建立了亚里巴王朝。十八世纪三十年代，阿曼被波斯人征服。到了1741年，系出也门王族的阿哈默德·赛义德赶走了波斯人，建立了对阿曼的统治权。十八世纪末，阿曼成了英法争夺的目标。1798年，英国的东印度公司和阿曼政府签订了第一个条约，英国取得了在阿曼建立企业的权利。在1839年和1891年，英国强迫阿曼签订了奴役性的条约，巩固了对阿曼的控制，排挤了法国势力。1939年英国与阿曼签订了“友好、通商和航海条约”，1951年又签订了“友好”条约，肯定了英国在阿曼享受了一百多年的各种特权，阿曼变成了英国的保护国。
    殖民者对阿曼的侵略和掠夺，引起了阿曼人民的坚决反抗，早在十九世纪末叶，阿曼各部落就发动过大规模起义。1913年在阿曼境内成立了独立的阿曼伊斯兰教长国，以尼兹瓦为首都，不承认英国的统治。1920年签订了萨比卜条约，马斯喀特苏丹国承认阿曼的独立。但是，1955年12月英国指挥马斯喀特苏丹军队侵入阿曼伊斯兰教长国，占领了尼兹瓦和其他地方。阿曼伊斯兰教教长加利布·阿里不得不从尼兹瓦逃走，但他坚决拒绝了英国的最后通牒，宣称将永远保卫自己的国家，并要求其他阿拉伯国家支持他把英国殖民者赶走。在英国支持下，马斯喀特的苏丹建立了对阿曼伊斯兰教长国的统治。此后，当地人民多次袭击英国飞机场，反对英国的统治。
    1949年，在阿曼伊斯兰教长国东北的布赖米绿洲附近发现了丰富的石油矿藏。由于阿曼和沙特阿拉伯在布赖米地区没有明确的边界，布赖米绿洲的主权问题一直未获解决。英国以阿曼“保护国”的身份企图占有这个地区，而取得了沙特阿拉伯石油开采权的美国也非常垂涎布赖米绿洲的石油资源，因此，它积极支持沙特阿拉伯取得布赖米绿洲。在过去，英国屡次指使马斯喀特苏丹进犯阿曼，就已反映了美英石油垄断集团争夺石油的矛盾。
