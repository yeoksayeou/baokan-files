Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 7th: According to Saigon newspapers, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities are expanding their persecution of Overseas Chinese.

The Ngo Dinh Diem authorities recently forced eleven Overseas Chinese doctors in Saigon to cease practicing medicine. In October 1956, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, in order to force locally born Overseas Chinese to adopt Vietnamese nationality, promulgated a law stipulating that Overseas Chinese doctors could not practice medicine in South Vietnam unless they adopted Vietnamese nationality. At the same time, it was stipulated that Overseas Chinese doctors who had already been granted permission to practice medicine before the promulgation of the above-mentioned law could "continue to practice for two years." However, only half a year later, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities announced the cancellation of this provision.

Recently, Overseas Chinese in various parts of South Vietnam who are engaged in industries listed as prohibited for Overseas Chinese are frequently summoned by the police of the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, requiring them to adopt Vietnamese nationality within a limited time, otherwise they will have to transfer their shops to Vietnamese people. In some places, it was originally announced that Overseas Chinese engaged in prohibited items could switch to non-prohibited items such as canned goods, condensed milk, and foreign wine. However, in Thu Dau Mot, near Saigon, eighty Overseas Chinese shops were ordered to close down less than a month after changing their business.

In Bien Hoa, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities forced Overseas Chinese who were banned from doing business to pay the full year's license tax, which was opposed by the Overseas Chinese because they were forced to close down after only four months of operation this year.

The Saigon Enterprise Bureau recently refused to process the procedures for Overseas Chinese to transfer real estate to other Overseas Chinese. It unreasonably stipulated that Overseas Chinese can only transfer real estate to Vietnamese people or to Overseas Chinese who have already adopted Vietnamese nationality. Locally born Overseas Chinese must first adopt Vietnamese nationality before they can sell their property. At the same time, the Saigon Foreign Exchange Bureau, under the pretext of "revising regulations," has announced the suspension of approving "free foreign exchange" to Overseas Chinese as a subsidy for their children studying outside of South Vietnam.

### 朝令夕改　火上加油  南越加紧迫害华侨

    朝令夕改　火上加油
    南越加紧迫害华侨
    新华社河内7日电　据西贡报纸报道：吴庭艳当局正在扩大对华侨的迫害。
    吴庭艳当局最近在西贡迫令十一名华侨医师停业。在1956年10月间，吴庭艳当局为了强迫土生华侨入越南籍，曾经颁布一个法律，规定华侨医师除非加入越南籍不得在南越开业。同时规定在上项法令颁布之前已经获准开业的华侨医师可以“继续执业两年”。但是只有半年时间，吴庭艳当局就又宣布把这个规定取消。
    最近南越各地经营被列为禁止华侨经营的行业的华侨经常被吴庭艳当局的警察召去，要他们限期加入越南籍，否则就要把商店转让给越南人。有些地方原来宣布，经营禁营物品的华侨可以改营罐头、炼乳、洋酒等非禁营物品。但是在西贡附近的土龙木有八十家华侨商店在改变营业不到一个月的时间又被勒令停业。
    在边和，吴庭艳当局迫令遭到禁止营业的华侨缴全年牌照税，遭到华侨的反对，因为他们在今年只经营了四个月就被迫关门。
    西贡企业局最近拒绝办理华侨将不动产转让给其他华侨的手续。它无理地规定，华侨只能把不动产转让给越南人或者转让给已经加入越南籍的华侨。土生华侨要先加入越南籍以后才能出卖产业。同时，西贡外汇局借口“修改条例”，已经宣布停止批给华侨作为接济在南越境外求学的子女所需要的“自由外汇”。
