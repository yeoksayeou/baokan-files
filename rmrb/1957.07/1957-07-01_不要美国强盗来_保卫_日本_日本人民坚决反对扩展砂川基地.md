Xinhua News Agency, 30th -- Tokyo Dispatch: More than three thousand farmers, workers, and students in Sunagawa held a rally on June 29th, demanding that the Japanese government immediately cease surveying land and abolish the unequal treaties that subordinate Japan to the United States.

    The rally passed a resolution strongly protesting the illegal suppression by the U.S. military and those manipulated by the U.S. military against the people involved in the struggle against the Sunagawa base. The masses participating in the rally also held a demonstration march towards the U.S. military base.

    Secretary-General Asanuma Inejirō of the Socialist Party said at the meeting that the Japanese government, with the support of U.S. military tear gas, clubs, and machine guns, forcibly surveyed the land in Sunagawa, which exposed its traitorous nature. Asanuma also said that the communiqué of Kishida Nobusuke's talks with the United States proved that he had agreed to the U.S. policy of turning Japan and Okinawa into U.S. nuclear war bases.

    Japan Communist Party representative Iwama Masao, cultural representative and Aichi University professor Takakuwa Sumio, representatives of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, representatives of the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, and Okamoto Ushitaro, representative of the Support Council of Trade Unions Against the Expansion of the Sunagawa Base, also delivered speeches at the meeting, expressing their support.

    Aoki Ichigoro, head of the Anti-Expansion of the Sunagawa Base Alliance, angrily said that the United States says its troops are stationed in Japan to defend Japan, but we do not want bandits holding machine guns and tear gas to seize our land to defend Japan.

    The declaration passed by the meeting firmly stated that the Sunagawa farmers and the Japanese people opposing the expansion of the base will firmly unite and fight to the end to achieve the goal of abolishing the base, striving for complete independence, and defending peace.

    不要美国强盗来“保卫”日本
    日本人民坚决反对扩展砂川基地
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：砂川农民、工人和学生等三千多人6月29日在砂川举行大会，要求日本政府立即停止测量土地，废除使日本隶属于美国的不平等条约。
    大会通过决议，严重抗议由美军和由美军的操纵而施加在反对砂川基地斗争的人民身上的不法镇压。参加大会的群众并且向美军基地举行示威游行。
    社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎在会上说，日本政府在美军的催泪弹、木棍和机关枪的支援下，强制测量砂川的土地，这就暴露了它的卖国性。浅沼又说，岸信介同美国会谈的公报，证明他是答应了美国把日本和冲绳变成美国的原子核战争基地的政策。
    日本共产党代表岩间正男，文化界代表、爱知大学教授高桑纯夫，日本工会总评议会代表，全日本学生自治会总联合会代表和反对扩展砂川基地工会支援协议会代表冈本丑太郎等人也相继在会上致词表示支持。
    反对扩展砂川基地联盟、行动队长青木市五郎愤慨地说，美国说它的军队驻扎在日本是为了保卫日本，但是，我们是不要手持机关枪和催泪弹来夺取我们的土地的强盗来保卫日本的。
    大会通过的宣言坚决表示，砂川农民和反对扩展基地的日本人民将牢牢地团结起来，为完成撤销基地、争取完全独立和保卫和平的目的而斗争到底。
