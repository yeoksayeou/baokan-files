Our newspaper’s June 22nd editorial, in “An Unusual Spring,” wrote: “Those who attack socialism discover that it is not the Communist Party that is surrounded by the masses, but themselves.” The recent experience of Guangdong rightist Luo Yiqun, who, under the guise of inspection, went to the countryside to incite farmers against the Communist Party, is the most vivid annotation of this statement.

Luo Yiqun took the opportunity of helping the Party in its rectification campaign to stir up trouble, making absurd statements, saying that "the people of Guangdong are on the verge of starvation."

Spring came to Guangdong. Guangdong was sunny everywhere. Unexpectedly, a black wind suddenly rose on the flat ground, and a puff of poisonous smoke emerged from the side. People immediately smelled that monsters and demons were at work, one of whom was Luo Yiqun, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and deputy director of the Guangdong Provincial Councilors' Office.

In the early stage of the Party's rectification movement, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee invited democratic personages to hold symposiums. Luo Yiqun harbored evil plans and hid slander under the guise of compassion, putting forward the absurd argument that the people of Guangdong were "on the verge of starvation," and attacked the People's Government for "whether the grain requisition and various taxes are too heavy, whether the purchase prices of agricultural products are too low, and whether the profits of state-owned commodities are too high," viciously provoking the relationship between the masses and the Party and the People's Government. At this meeting, Luo Yiqun also slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, saying that the activists in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were "attempting to gain the trust of the Party and to obtain a shortcut to joining the Party and the League at the expense of the reputation, status, or lives of others."

Luo Yiqun's fallacy aroused a solemn rebuttal from people from all walks of life. At the same time, at many symposiums, everyone successively revealed Luo Yiqun's consistent anti-Communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist remarks and actions. However, Luo Yiqun neither listened to the just and stern rebuttals made by people from all walks of life, nor did he believe the convincing facts listed in the rebuttals. He decided to conduct an inspection in the countryside, on the one hand, to find evidence for his fallacy, and on the other hand, to go to the countryside to ignite the fire, attempting to use his fallacy to incite the masses as his backing for attacking the Party.

Luo Yiqun, under the pretext of inspection, personally went to the countryside to start a fire and find a basis for his fallacy.

From June 11th to 16th, Luo Yiqun "inspected" Xingning. When he saw farmers, he would first ask: Is there enough food to eat? Is there enough oil and meat to eat? Why is your complexion so yellow? He even asked farmers who were very sturdy: Why are you so weak? Of course, he did not get the answer that satisfied him.

Before Luo Yiqun returned to his hometown of Longtian Township in Xingning County, he first wrote several letters to the local landlords, counter-revolutionaries under surveillance, and former military officers, asking them to collect materials. After Luo Yiqun arrived, he immediately made arrangements and colluded with some people to hold two meetings specifically to collect materials on "farmers on the verge of starvation."

But Luo Yiqun traveled from Xingning to Pingyuan, to Jiaoling, from the countryside to the schools, not knowing how many places he went to, how many people he met, or how much effort he spent, but he could not find any material to support the idea of "farmers being on the verge of starvation."

Luo Yiqun traveled to many areas in several counties, but not only did he not find any basis for his fallacy, but he also fell into the heavy encirclement of angry masses.

Did Luo Yiqun's insidious activities have no results at all? No, there were results. His activities were applauded by a small group of counter-revolutionaries, landlords, and people under surveillance. Wherever he went, rumors were rampant, and the enemies were arrogant. Some landlords composed folk songs to satirize the peasants. Some shouted, "See when the heads of cadres and commune members will fall." Counter-revolutionaries spread rumors: "The Kuomintang has landed in Shantou," "The Kuomintang has bombed Guangzhou into ruins." In Duopo Township, where Luo Yiqun had been, there even appeared reactionary slogans of "Down with the Communist bandits" and "The time is ripe for farmers on the verge of starvation to take action to overthrow the Communist bandits."

However, there was also another kind of result, which was the angry counterattack of the broad masses of people. In Jiaoling

Luo Yiqun was at a loss for words, so he had to say: "There is absolutely no verge of starvation in Jiaoling."

During his five days in Jiaoling County, Luo Yiqun was already surrounded by local farmers, students, and workers. On the 24th, the faculty and students of Jiaoling County No. 2 Middle School questioned Luo Yiqun on the spot: Why did you say that the farmers in Guangdong were on the verge of starvation? On the 25th, No. 2 Middle School sent dozens of representatives to the county seat to invite him to attend a symposium, preparing to continue to refute his fallacy, but Luo Yiqun refused.

The next day, teachers and students from No. 2 Middle School, teachers from No. 1 Middle School, and some staff from government organizations held a five-hour symposium with Luo Yiqun. Luo Yiqun could not exonerate his fallacy, and even falsely claimed that "I said the verge of starvation refers to the city, not the countryside, and refers to the whole country, not your place." On the 28th, more than 1,000 farmers, students, and workers in Jiaoling County held a symposium in the cultural center. Speakers successively cited facts to refute Luo Yiqun's fallacy. Luo Yiqun was at a loss for words and said in embarrassment: "There is absolutely no verge of starvation in Jiaoling." Seeing that things were not going well, Luo Yiqun secretly left Jiaoling at six o'clock in the morning on the 29th and fled in a hurry. In Meixian

Luo Yiqun shirked responsibility, and he actually said that the fallacy of "verge of starvation" was a misrepresentation by Nanfang Daily through taking things out of context.

However, Luo Yiqun did not give up. He went from Jiaoling to Meixian, attempting to continue peddling his fallacy and inciting the masses against the Communist Party. However, Luo Yiqun's plan was wrong again. At 9:00 a.m. on June 29th, when the news of Luo Yiqun's arrival in Meicheng spread, about 2,000 residents, workers, students, and government cadres in Meicheng went to his residence with anger to question him: "What is the basis for the claim that farmers are on the verge of starvation?" Then, farmers from Fucheng, Shuibai, Fuda, Chengdong, Chengxi, Xiyang and other townships also sent more than 1,000 representatives to come and reason with Luo Yiqun after hearing the news. Luo Yiqun unloaded his luggage for about 30 minutes, and the entire four-story building of the hotel and the doorway and the street were filled with people looking for him to argue. At about 11:00 a.m., at the Meixian People's Cinema, more than 3,000 workers, peasants, residents, and cadres debated with Luo Yiqun. Many people refuted Luo Yiqun's fallacy with facts from their own personal experiences. Luo Yiqun could not answer, and he blamed others, saying that his fallacy of "verge of starvation" was a misrepresentation by Nanfang Daily through taking things out of context! At about 12:00 p.m., various slogans of "Oppose rightist Luo Yiqun," "Support the Communist Party," and "Resolutely take the socialist road" appeared in the streets and alleys of Meicheng. At 3:30 p.m., about 1,000 workers and teachers gathered at the Workers' Cultural Palace to refute Luo Yiqun's fallacy. In Xingning

Luo Yiqun simply denied the debt, and he actually denied that he had said the words "farmers are on the verge of starvation."

Luo Yiqun was terrified by the voices of justice in Meixian. Early in the morning of the 30th, he left Meixian and went to Xingning.

Farmers in Guantian Township, 40 miles away from Xingning County, were waiting for him on the highway in advance to debate with Luo Yiqun face to face. When Luo Yiqun arrived by car, more than 50 farmers immediately surrounded him. Only because the worker representatives from Xingning County and the farmer representatives from the suburbs repeatedly explained to the local farmers that Luo Yiqun should be sent to the county seat as soon as possible did the farmers let him go. Luo Yiqun entered the city and arrived in front of the hotel, and was immediately surrounded by more and more people. Only after repeated persuasion by the workers maintaining order did the masses make way for Luo Yiqun.

Soon, representatives of workers and farmers entered the hotel to visit Luo Yiqun. A worker representative said: We people with the smell of sweat have come to visit you! Luo Yiqun replied: I want to rest. Then someone questioned him: Now that you are surrounded by the people you said are "on the verge of starvation," what are your thoughts? Luo Yiqun shamelessly denied that he had said the words "farmers are on the verge of starvation."

That afternoon, people from all walks of life in Xingning held a symposium to refute Luo Yiqun's fallacy. The meeting was originally invited to 150 people, but during the meeting, more and more workers and farmers participated, increasing to 1,500 people. The worker and farmer representatives who spoke at the meeting refuted Luo Yiqun with irrefutable facts.

The car carrying Luo Yiqun traveled one mile in 40 minutes.

On July 1st, 50,000 people in Xingning County gathered and marched to continue denouncing Luo Yiqun's fallacy and his reactionary activities.

On the same day, there were two mass gatherings that wanted Luo Yiqun to come and debate. But as soon as Luo Yiqun went out, he was surrounded by the masses. The County People's Committee had to prepare a car to carry Luo Yiqun to the venue of the conference. Along the way, the car moved slowly with the help of the people's police opening the way. After the meeting, Luo Yiqun had just slipped out from behind the stage when the road was blocked by tens of thousands of angry people. Even the car could not get up. Everyone shouted to continue to debate with Luo Yiqun, and some hated him so much that they wanted to poke him with the handle of an umbrella. Luo Yiqun entered the car under the protection of the police and the worker pickets. When the car started, the crowd still ran tightly around the car. Along the way, the merchants, shop assistants, and peddlers in the shops along the street also surrounded and scolded Luo Yiqun. In this way, the car could only move like a snail in the tight encirclement of the masses. Although it was only a mile or so from the venue to the County People's Committee, it took 40 minutes to drive.

On July 2nd, Luo Yiqun was still surrounded by the masses.

Without the protection of the people's police, Luo Yiqun could not move an inch.

During his stay in Xingning County, Luo Yiqun did not dare to leave the people's police. The angry masses made this once rampant politician panic. He did not even dare to stay in the hotel, because every day a large number of workers and farmers came to the hotel to debate with him. He asked the county magistrate to live in the County People's Committee. His request was granted. But no matter where he lived, as soon as Luo Yiqun went out, hundreds or even thousands of people would surround him. Without the protection of three or four policemen, he could not leave the dormitory a step. He wanted a haircut. Although the barber shop was only a hundred steps away from the County People's Committee, how could Luo Yiqun, who could not move an inch, safely cross this short distance and reach the barber shop? So he had to invite the barber to the dormitory to give him a haircut.

Luo Yiqun could not get away. In a terrible fix, the People's Government tried all kinds of methods to get him back to Guangzhou.

Without finding any basis for his fallacy and being counterattacked by the masses, Luo Yiqun decided to return to Guangzhou. On July 5th, he left Xingning by car, but at noon, when the car arrived in Heyuan, it was surrounded by people coming from all directions to debate with him. Luo Yiqun, huddled in the carriage and trembling, was surrounded by the masses and entered the Heyuan County People's Committee. At the request of the masses, the Heyuan County Magistrate agreed to organize a Preparatory Committee of Representatives from All Walks of Life in Heyuan County to Refute Rightists and debate with Luo Yiqun. That night, 5,000 people from urban and rural areas participated in the conference in the rain and severely condemned Luo Yiqun's fallacy.

Cadres persuaded the masses not to stop the car halfway.

From Heyuan City to Guangzhou, it is necessary to pass through Boluo, Zengcheng and other places. On the evening of the 5th and the morning of the 6th, many people in these two counties were preparing to wait for Luo Yiqun to reason with him. Under this situation, how could Luo Yiqun return to Guangzhou? Heyuan County asked the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee for instructions. Considering that there were more people in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City who wanted to debate with Luo Yiqun, and considering that he was old, the province decided to send the Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference to pick him up in Heyuan by special car, and told the leading cadres of Boluo and Zengcheng counties by telephone to persuade the masses not to stop the car halfway.

On the morning of the 6th, as soon as Luo Yiqun came out of the Heyuan County People's Committee, he was surrounded by more than 100 people who wanted to keep him and continue the debate. After the county magistrate repeatedly persuaded him, the masses agreed to let him go, but they put up slogans all over the car body.

Covering himself tightly with a sack, he was not discovered by the masses.

The car body was covered with slogans, and he would definitely be recognized by the masses. Therefore, as soon as he left the city, he immediately washed the slogans clean with water. At the same time, sacks were prepared in the car so that Luo Yiqun could lie in the place behind the car where luggage was placed, telling him to cover his body with sacks as soon as he saw the masses. It seems that Luo Yiqun was sincerely grateful for the arrangements made by the Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He lay down quietly, covering his stomach and legs with two sacks, and holding the edges of the sacks vigilantly with both hands. As soon as he saw crowds and villages, he immediately covered himself tightly with sacks.

Drive fast and stop less to avoid accidents.

The car sped towards Guangzhou at a speed of 80 miles per hour. When approaching Zengcheng, a door panel was erected next to a village with the words "Question Luo Yiqun" written on it. Some people gathered and watched this speeding car with suspicious eyes. Luo Yiqun found out and repeatedly asked people to tell the driver to continue to speed up. Luo Yiqun said that he must not stop in a town near here, otherwise, he believed that Zengcheng would definitely not be able to pass. Asked him why? He replied: There are many merchants from Xingning in this town, and they can recognize me. When the car entered Zengcheng, the people in the car were holding a handful of sweat. Because the streets were full of slogans questioning Luo Yiqun, and there were many people waiting to question Luo Yiqun standing on the side of the road. This car, which was already traveling at a speed of more than 40 kilometers per hour, aroused everyone's suspicion and attention. Some people looked into the car, obviously looking for Luo Yiqun, whom they had been waiting for. However, the car was driving so fast, and Luo Yiqun was covered so tightly with sacks, how could the masses discover him? In this way, Luo Yiqun finally passed the eyes and ears of the masses along the way under careful protection. Although he was in a terrible fix, he returned to Guangzhou safely, ending his unusual "inspection."

What kind of person was Luo Yiqun originally? As early as 1924, he was a member of the right wing of the Kuomintang.

People can't help but ask: What kind of person is this extremely crazy rightist Luo Yiqun?

Luo Yiqun was originally a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. This man, who called himself "the only successor of Mr. Sun Yat-sen," betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen as early as 1924 and became a member of the right wing of the Kuomintang headed by Hu Hanmin. From then on, he hated the Communist Party. Even today, as long as he hears others studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's writings, he scolds, "It's really shameful!" During the Anti-Japanese War, Luo Yiqun was the director of the Southern Administrative Office of the Kuomintang. At that time, he persecuted progressive people in many ways. Zhang Yan, the Southern Commissioner of the Kuomintang, cooperated with the people's armed forces led by the Communist Party to resist Japan. Luo Yiqun, who had always been anti-communist, strictly monitored him and constantly informed against him, and finally forced Zhang Yan to flee to Guangxi, where he fell into the hands of Kuomintang agents and was killed.

Luo Yiqun said that "Guangdong farmers are on the verge of starvation" now, which is naturally a slander; but what was the life of Guangdong farmers when Luo Yiqun was a high-ranking Kuomintang official? It is enough to say 1943. The drought that year was shorter than in 1955, but more than one million people starved to death in Guangdong Province. At that time, some people who were desperate for hunger robbed Luo Yiqun's car of rice. When Luo Yiqun caught them, he instructed his confidants to kill the people who robbed the rice!

Luo Yiqun is also one of the biggest landlords and bullies in Xingning County, sheltering gambling dens and smoking, truly committing all kinds of evil. Before liberation, he also colluded with the four major families of Chiang, Soong, Kong, and Chen, sucking a large amount of people's fat and ointment in the Central South region, and bought foreign houses and cars in Guangzhou.

Luo Yiqun has always hated the Communist Party. On the eve of the liberation of Guangzhou, at a "Memorial Week," Luo Yiqun, in view of the crumbling reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, in despair, cried loudly to the portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, scolding Mr. Sun Yat-sen for not having vision and using Chiang Kai-shek wrongly, so that he could not eliminate the Communist Party. His words were certainly dissatisfied with the reactionaries, and he was warned by Chiang's secret agents. So he had to flee to Hong Kong. But at that time, he still held the idea of "wait and see" about the Kuomintang and was not completely disappointed. It was not until September 1949, when the People's Liberation Army attacked the Guangdong border with irresistible force, that he signed the telegram of uprising in Hong Kong.

However, Chiang Kai-shek's rule did give him some benefits. Therefore, after liberation, in his autobiography, he still referred to Chiang Kai-shek as "Principal Chiang" and "Commander-in-Chief Chiang." Even this year, when speaking at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, he publicly referred to Chiang Kai-shek as "Mr. Chiang." Luo Yiqun also missed the old regime. In 1950, when he came to Beijing, he stayed at the Beijing Hotel. In order to show his identity, he deliberately placed his fake National Congress attendance certificate on the table. According to people who are familiar with him, the purpose of his doing so was, on the one hand, to show that he had such a "high" status in the past, and at the same time, he missed the reactionary ruling regime of the Kuomintang, trying to preserve the desire to be a big official under Chiang Kai-shek.

Luo Yiqun's anti-Communist and anti-people remarks did not completely stop after liberation. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries last year, Luo Yiqun viciously scolded the people of the Communist Party branch as "simply secret agents." Long ago, Luo Yiqun advocated organizing so-called "impartial people" to check the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Last year, when Luo Yiqun went to Beijing to attend a meeting, he proposed to organize an "organization composed of 'impartial people' without Communist Party members and people's representatives to conduct 'rehabilitation.'" Even during this "inspection," he still did not forget to oppose communism. At Jiaoling No. 2 Middle School, he clamored that "it doesn't matter if you are anti-Communist and anti-socialist." Despite the fact that Luo Yiqun was so reactionary in the past, the Party and the government have taken great care of him since liberation, but he is not satisfied. He has been active in various places, trying to climb higher. He went to Beijing to ask to be appointed as the chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and also asked Governor Tao Zhu to appoint him as the curator of the Guangdong Provincial Museum of Literature and History. When his requests were not fulfilled, he was dissatisfied with the Communist Party and the government, and even the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang organization. He had collected dozens of letters from people who had been suppressed, sent to labor reform, or placed under surveillance in the past, especially three of them, which he kept on him all day long as capital for carrying out reactionary activities, and said that he would "hide them in famous mountains and pass them on to future generations." At a symposium held by the United Front Work Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, when someone talked about the achievements of the Communist Party, Luo Yiqun scolded others as "shameless! Shameless!"

Who is really shameless? Luo Yiqun should be able to answer this question after this experience in the countryside!

专栏：

    罗翼群放火不成烧了自己
    本报6月22日社论在“不平常的春天”里写道：“向社会主义进攻的人们发现，被群众包围的并不是共产党，而是他们自己”。广东的右派分子罗翼群最近借视察之名下乡煽动农民反对共产党的遭遇，就是这段话的最生动的注解。
    借帮助党整风的机会兴风作浪，罗翼群大发谬论，他说“广东人民接近饿死的边缘”
    春天来到广东。广东处处艳阳天。不料，平地黑风骤起，斜刺里冒出一股毒烟，人们顿时嗅出这是牛鬼蛇神在作怪，其中一个就是全国政协委员、广东省参事室副主任罗翼群。
    党进行整风运动初期，广东省人民委员会邀请民主人士举行座谈会。罗翼群心惴恶计，把毁谤藏在悲天悯人的外衣里，提出了所谓广东人民“接近饿死的边缘”的谬论，并攻击人民政府“征粮及各种税收是否过重，征购农产价格是否有偏低，国营商品利润是否过高”，恶毒地挑拨群众同党和人民政府的关系。在这次会上，罗翼群还诬蔑肃反运动，把肃反运动中的积极分子说成是“不惜牺牲他人的名誉、地位或生命，企图取得党的信任，为争取入党入团的捷径”。
    罗翼群的谬论，激起了各界人士严正的驳斥。同时，在许多座谈会上，大家先后揭发了罗翼群一贯的反共、反人民、反社会主义的言论和行动。但是，罗翼群对各界人士所作的义正辞严的驳斥，对大家在反驳中所列举的有说服力的事实，既不倾听，更不相信。他决定要到农村作一次视察，一方面为他的谬论找寻证据，另一方面去到农村进行点火，企图用自己的谬论煽动群众作为他向党进攻的后盾。
    罗翼群假借视察名义，亲自到农村放火，并为自己的谬论找根据
    6月11日到16日，罗翼群在兴宁“视察”。他见到农民就先问：粮食够不够吃？油、肉够不够吃？你的脸色为甚么这样黄？甚至面对着体格非常结实的农民也问：你为甚么这样瘦弱？当然，他没有得到使他满意的回答。
    罗翼群在回到他的家乡兴宁县龙田乡以前，更先写了几封信给村里的地主分子、被管制的反革命分子和旧军官，要他们搜集材料。罗翼群到了以后，又立即做了布置，并且串连了一些人开了两次会，专门搜集“农民接近饿死边缘”的材料。
    但是罗翼群从兴宁到平远，到蕉岭，从农村跑到学校，不知走了多少地方，不知碰到多少人，不知费了多少力气，就是找不到“农民接近饿死边缘”的材料。
    罗翼群走了几个县的很多地区，不但没有给自己的谬论找到任何根据，反而陷入愤怒的群众重重的包围
    难道罗翼群这些包藏祸心的活动毫无结果吗？不，有结果的。他的活动，受到了反革命分子、地主分子和被管制分子一小撮人的喝采。他所到之处，谣言四起，敌人嚣张。有的地主分子编山歌讽刺农民。有人叫嚣“看干部和社员的头几时会掉”。反革命分子造谣：“国民党在汕头登陆了”，“国民党将广州炸滥了”。在罗翼群到过的笃坡乡，更出现了“打倒共匪”、“农民到饿死边缘，行动起来打倒共匪的时机成熟了”的反动标语。
    但是，也还有另外一种结果，这就是广大人民群众的愤怒的反击。在蕉岭
    罗翼群理屈词穷，他只好说：“在蕉岭没有到饿死的边缘，绝对没有”
    罗翼群在蕉岭县的五天当中，就已经陷入了当地农民、学生、职工的重围之中。24日，蕉岭县第二中学教职员和学生就曾当场质问罗翼群：你为什么说广东农民接近饿死的边缘？25日，第二中学又派了代表几十人到县城请他参加座谈会，准备继续驳斥他的谬论，但是罗翼群拒绝了。
    第二天，第二中学师生、一中老师、一些机关职工，一起与罗翼群举行了五小时的座谈。罗翼群不能为他的谬论开脱，竟又诡称“我说饿死边缘指的是城市并不是农村，指的全国不是指你们这里”。28日，蕉岭县城一千多名农民、学生、职工又在文化馆举行座谈会，发言人接连举出事实驳斥罗翼群的谬论。罗翼群理屈词穷，狼狈不堪地说：“在蕉岭没有到饿死的边缘，绝对没有。”一看事情不妙，29日清早六点钟，罗翼群便偷偷地离开了蕉岭，溜之大吉了。在梅县
    罗翼群推卸责任，他居然说“饿死边缘”的谬论是被南方日报断章取义弄错了
    但是，罗翼群并没有死心。他从蕉岭到了梅县，企图继续兜售他的谬论，煽动群众反对共产党。可是，罗翼群的算盘又打错了。6月29日上午九点钟，当罗翼群来到梅城镇的消息传出后，梅城镇的居民、工人、学生、机关干部约二千多人，怀着愤怒的心情到他的住所去质问他：“农民接近饿死的边缘的根据何在？”接着，附城、水白、扶大、城东、城西、西阳等乡的农民听到消息后，也派了代表一千多人赶来和罗翼群讲理。罗翼群卸下行装大约有三十分钟，整个旅社的四层楼内和门口、大街上都站满了找他辩理的人群。上午十一时左右，在梅县人民电影院，三千多工人、农民、居民、干部，向罗翼群展开争辩。许多人都用切身经历的事实驳斥了罗翼群的谬论。罗翼群不能作答，他竟嫁祸于人，说他的“饿死边缘”的谬论是被南方日报断章取义弄错了！十二时左右，梅城镇大街小巷出现了各式各样的“反对右派分子罗翼群”，“拥护共产党”，“坚决走社会主义道路”的标语。下午三时半，又有约一千名工人、教师在工人文化宫集会，驳斥罗翼群的谬论。在兴宁
    罗翼群干脆赖账，他竟然否认他说过“农民接近饿死边缘”的话
    罗翼群在梅县，被正义的呼声吓得狼狈不堪，30日清早，他离开梅县去到兴宁。
    距离兴宁县城四十里的官田乡的农民，为了当面和罗翼群辩论，预先在公路上等他。当罗翼群乘车到达后，五十多个农民立即包围了他。只是由于兴宁县城的工人代表和城郊农民代表反复向当地农民说明，要赶快把罗翼群送到县城去，农民才放他走开。罗翼群进城到了旅馆门前，又立即被越来越多的群众所包围。经过维持秩序工人的一再劝说，群众才给罗翼群让开路来。
    不久，工人和农民的代表进入旅馆访问罗翼群。一个工人代表说：我们这些有汗酸味的人访问你来了！罗翼群回答说：我要休息。随后有人质问他：现在你被你所说的“接近饿死边缘”的人们包围起来，你有甚么感想？罗翼群竟无耻地否认他说过“农民接近饿死边缘”的话。
    当天下午，兴宁各界人民举行了驳斥罗翼群谬论的座谈会。这个会议原来邀请了一百五十人参加，但在会议进行中，工人、农民越来越多，一直增加到一千五百人。会上发言的工人和农民的代表，用无可辩驳的事实驳斥了罗翼群。
    一里多的路程，载罗翼群的车子走了四十分钟
    7月1日，兴宁县五万群众集会游行，继续痛斥罗翼群的谬论和他进行的反动活动。
    当天，有两个群众集会要罗翼群去辩理。但罗一出门，即被群众包围。县人民委员会只好备汽车把罗翼群载到大会会场去，一路上，要靠人民警察的开路，汽车才慢慢地走动。大会结束后，罗翼群刚从台后溜出来，去路就被几万愤怒的群众挤得水泄不通，连汽车都上不去。大家高呼，要继续和罗翼群辩理，有人恨得想用雨伞柄戳他；罗翼群在民警、工人纠察队保护下进了汽车。汽车开动时，人群还紧紧地围着汽车跑。一路上，沿街店户的商人、店员、小贩也都围上来，痛骂罗翼群。这样，汽车只能在群众的紧紧包围中蜗牛似地开行，从大会会场到县人民委员会虽然只有一里多的途程，却足足开了四十多分钟。
    7月2日，罗翼群仍然陷在群众的包围之中。
    没有人民警察的保护，罗翼群寸步难行
    在兴宁县期间，罗翼群不敢离开人民警察。愤怒的群众，使这个猖狂一时的政客惊慌失措起来。他甚至不敢住在旅馆了，因为每天有大批工人和农民到旅馆中来和他辩理。他向县长要求住到县人民委员会去。他的要求得到了应允。但无论住在那里，罗翼群只要一出门，就有几百人甚至几千人围上来。没有三、四个警察保护，他便不能离开宿舍一步。他要理发，虽然理发店离开县人民委员会只不过百步之遥，但是已经寸步难行的罗翼群，怎么能平平安安地跨过这段短短的距离，到达理发馆呢？于是只得把理发师请到宿舍来理。
    罗翼群无计脱身，狼狈万状，人民政府想了种种办法，才使他回到广州
    没有为自己的谬论寻到任何根据，又受到群众的反击，罗翼群决定要回广州了。7月5日，他乘车由兴宁出发，但中午车到河源，又被从四面八方到来的群众包围起来，要和他辩理。与罗翼群缩在车厢里发抖，被群众簇拥着进了河源县人民委员会。河源县长在群众的要求下，同意组织河源县各界人民代表反右派分子筹委会，同罗翼群辩理。当晚，城乡五千群众冒雨参加了大会，对罗翼群的谬论进行了严厉的斥责。
    干部说服群众不要半路拦车
    河源城到广州，中间要经过博罗、增城等地。5日晚、6日早晨，这两县有许多群众准备等待罗翼群说理。在这种形势下，罗翼群如何才能回到广州？河源县向广东省人民委员会请示。省里考虑到广东省、广州市还有更多的人要同罗翼群辩论，又念他年纪大了，便决定派省政协副秘书长乘专车到河源接他回来，并且打电话告诉博罗、增城两县的领导干部，说服群众，不要半路拦车。
    6日上午，罗翼群从河源县人民委员会刚一出来，又被一百多群众包围，要留下他继续辩论。经过县长一再说服，群众同意他走了，但是在车身上贴满了标语。
    麻袋紧遮身总算未被群众发现
    车身贴满标语，一定会被群众认出。于是，一出城，马上就用水把标语涮洗干净。同时，车上准备了麻袋，让罗翼群躺在车后放行李的地方，告诉他一看到群众，就把身体用麻袋遮起来。看来，罗翼群是衷心地感激政协副秘书长的安排的。他安静地躺下来，用两条麻袋遮好肚子和两腿，两只手警惕地捏着麻袋边。只要看到人群和村庄，他立刻用麻袋把自己盖严。
    少停车开快车免得发生意外
    汽车以每小时八十里的速度向广州开进。快到增城的时候，在一个村庄旁边竖着一块门板，上面写着“质问罗翼群”五个大字。还聚集着一些人用怀疑的眼光注视着这辆急驶的车子。罗翼群发现了，连连求人告诉司机，继续加快速度。罗翼群说在这附近的一个镇子上绝对不能停车，不然，他认为增城肯定过不去。问他为什么？他答道：这个镇上有兴宁的许多商人，他们能认出我来。车子进入增城时，车上的人都捏着一把汗。因为满街都是质问罗翼群的标语，道旁又站着许多等待质问罗翼群的群众。这辆时速已经超过四十公里的车子，引起了大家的怀疑和注意，有些人探头看着坐在车子里的人，显然是在找寻车上是不是坐着他们久等的罗翼群，可是，车子开得这样快，罗翼群又被麻袋盖得那样严，群众怎么能发现呢？就这样，罗翼群终于在周密的保护下混过了沿途群众的耳目。虽然是十分狼狈，但他却平安地回到了广州，结束了他这一次不平常的“视察”。
    罗翼群本来是个什么样的人呢？远在1924年他就是国民党右派中的一分子
    人们不能不问：这个疯狂之极的右派分子罗翼群是什么样的人？
  罗翼群，原来是国民党的中央委员。这个自称为“孙中山先生唯一继承人”的人，远在1924年就背叛孙中山先生，成为以胡汉民为首的国民党右派分子。从那时起，他就仇恨共产党，直到今天，他只要听见别人学习马列主义和毛主席的著作，他就大骂“真是可耻”！抗战时期，罗翼群是国民党的南路行署主任。当时他曾多方迫害进步人士。国民党的南路专员张炎和共产党领导的人民武装合作抗日，一贯反共的罗翼群就对他严加监视，并且不断告密，最后迫使张炎出走广西，结果落在国民党特务手里被杀害了。
    罗翼群说现在“广东农民接近饿死边缘”，这自然是诬蔑；但是，罗翼群当国民党高官时期，广东农民的生活如何呢？只说1943年就够了。那年的旱灾比1955年要短，但是广东全省饿死的人在一百万以上。当时，有些饿急了的人抢了罗翼群的一车米，被罗翼群捉到，他便指使他的亲信把抢米的人杀死了！
    罗翼群还是兴宁县数一数二的大地主大恶霸，包庇烟赌，真正是无恶不作。解放前，他还和蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族勾结在一起，在中南地区吸吮了大批民脂民膏，在广州买下了洋房和小汽车。
    罗翼群是一直仇恨共产党的。广州解放前夕，在一次“纪念周”上，罗翼群鉴于国民党反动统治的摇摇欲坠，绝望之余，他对着孙中山先生遗像大哭，骂孙中山先生没有眼光，错用了蒋介石，以致不能消灭共产党。他的话，反动派当然是不满的，他因此受到蒋帮特务的警告。于是他不得不逃到香港。但当时他对国民党仍抱着“看看再说”的想法，并没有完全失望。直到1949年9月，解放大军势如破竹地攻到广东边境时，他才在香港签名参加通电起义。
    但是，蒋介石的统治毕竟给了他些好处，因此，解放以后，在他的自传里，他仍称蒋介石为“蒋校长”、“蒋总司令”。直到今年在全国政协会议上发言时，他还公开称蒋介石为“蒋先生”。罗翼群对旧政权也是念念不忘。1950年他来北京时，住在北京饭店。他为了显示自己的身份，故意将他的伪国大出席证摆在桌子上。据熟悉他的人说，他这样做的目的，一方面是表示他过去有那样“高”的地位，同时还留恋国民党反动统治政权，妄图保留着想做蒋介石大官的愿望。
    罗翼群的反共反人民的言论在解放以后并没有完全停止，去年肃反时，罗翼群就恶毒地辱骂中共支部的人“简直是特务”。还在很早以前，罗翼群就主张要组织所谓“公正人士”检查肃反。去年罗翼群到北京开会时就提出要组织一个“由‘公正人士’组成的、没有共产党员和人民代表的机构来进行‘平反’”。就在这次“视察”中，他也还念念不忘反共。他在蕉岭第二中学就曾叫嚣“反共、反社会主义不要紧”。尽管罗翼群过去如此反动，解放以后党和政府对他还是很照顾，但他并不满足，个人四处活动，想爬得更高。他曾到北京活动，要求委他为民革广东省委员会主任委员，还曾要求陶铸省长委他当广东省文史馆馆长。要求未遂，他就对中共和政府甚至民革组织不满。他曾弄了几十封以前被镇压或劳改、管制的人的来信，特别是其中三封信，整天藏在身上，当作进行反动活动的资本，并说要“藏之名山，传诸后人”。在中共广东省委统战部召开的座谈会上，有人谈到共产党的功绩，罗翼群竟骂别人“无耻！无耻！”
    究竟谁才是真正无耻呢？罗翼群有了这次下乡的经历，该可以回答了吧！
