Since July 6th, the Heze and Jining regions in southwestern Shandong, and the Linyi region in southern Shandong, have been hit by four rounds of heavy rainfall, with rainfall generally exceeding 500 millimeters and reaching over 700 millimeters in some areas. The water levels of major rivers and small to medium-sized rivers have risen sharply, with nearly a thousand breaches and overflows occurring. Many farmlands have been flooded.

    山东部分地区暴雨成灾
    各级领导及驻军已组织力量前往抢救
    新华社济南18日电  今年山东地区暴雨来得又早又猛，从7月6日以来，鲁西南的菏泽、济宁专区和鲁南的临沂专区，连降四次暴雨，降雨量一般在五百公厘以上，有些地区多至七百多公厘。主要河流和中小河流水位猛涨，先后漫溢决口近千处，不少农田被淹。单县、曹县、城武和苍山等县有许多村庄被大水包围，房舍冲塌很多，人畜也有伤亡。
    目前，受灾地区的党、政机关干部和驻军，全力投入了抢险救灾工作。山东省人民委员会、省防汛指挥部也组织交通运输等部门的人力物力前往抢救，并拨救济款四十万元。昨天中央有关部门派出飞机三架，装有橡皮船、救生圈和熟食品等，飞往灾区空投。中国人民解放军驻济南部队的领导机关，也派出了工程兵部队，携带大批物资、器械，分赴重灾区抢救。（附图片）
