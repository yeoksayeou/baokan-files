Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 29th: British youth participating in the festival held a meeting and gathering with Chinese youth today in the beer hall of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition in Moscow.

The Chinese and British youth arrived almost simultaneously. As soon as they got out of the cars, they linked arms and chatted in small groups. Stephen, a student from Oxford University in England, said in his first sentence: "I am very interested in the construction of New China."

How eager the friends living in capitalist Britain are to know about New China. Miller, a primary school teacher from Scotland, said that before coming to Moscow, more than 90% of British youth expressed that the first people they wanted to meet after coming to Moscow were Chinese youth. This wish came true today. Miller personally tied a colorful scarf prepared for the festival around the neck of Wu Xueqian, the deputy head of the Chinese youth delegation. She said: I admire the progress of New China very much. Let us establish a lasting and cordial friendship.

Ke Wennan, a British youth who lived in China for nine years and is now an employee of a Chinese bookstore in London, volunteered to be a Mandarin translator this time. He said that it was very difficult for them to participate in the festival because the British government did not support it. He said that even dance troupes subsidized by the British government did not come because they did not get the support of the British government.

Among the youth from these two countries thousands of miles apart, there are Christians, students, and young capitalists. They sat together in the beer hall covered with green vines, and strolled together beside the flowerbeds and fountains, chatting casually without any restraint.

The Chinese youth gave satisfactory answers to the questions raised by British friends about China's election system and other issues.

During the meeting, British friends also performed Scottish dances and accordion solos; Chinese youth also performed peacock dances for two people and flute solos.

Many people exchanged names, addresses, commemorative badges and gifts. They said that although their ideologies are different, the bond of friendship connects everyone together.

Wu Xueqian said on behalf of the Chinese youth: Britain and China are both world powers. Let the youth of our two countries join hands in the cause of safeguarding peace.

    联欢节是友谊的纽带
    中英青年亲切会见
    新华社莫斯科29日电　参加联欢节的英国青年，今天在莫斯科苏联农业展览会的啤酒房里，和中国青年举行了会见联欢会。
    中英两国青年几乎是同时到达的。他们一下汽车就手挽着手，三三两两地交谈起来。英国牛津大学学生斯蒂芬的第一句话就是：“我对新中国的建设很感兴趣。”
    生活在资本主义英国的朋友们是多么渴望知道新中国的情况。苏格兰的小学教师米勒说，英国青年在来莫斯科以前，有90％以上的人表示来莫斯科后第一个要会见的是中国青年。这个愿望在今天实现了。米勒把他们为联欢节准备的一块采色头巾亲自系在中国青年代表团副团长吴学谦颈上。她说：我很羡慕新中国的进步。让我们建立长久的亲切的友谊吧。
    在中国居住过九年的英国青年柯文南现在是伦敦一家中文书店的营业员。这次他自动担任了华语翻译。他说，他们来参加联欢节是很困难的。因为英国政府不予支持。他说，曾经有受英国政府津贴的歌舞团就因为得不到英国政府的支持而没有来。
    这两个相距万里的国家的青年中，有基督教徒、学生和青年资本家。他们一同坐在复盖着绿色葡萄藤的啤酒房内，一同漫步在花圃和喷泉旁边，毫无拘束地随便交谈。
    中国青年对英国朋友提出的关于中国选举制度等问题都作了满意的回答。
    会见时，英国朋友还表演了苏格兰舞蹈和手风琴独奏；中国青年也表演了双人孔雀舞和笛子独奏等节目。
    许多人互留姓名、住址，互赠纪念章和礼物。他们表示，彼此意识形态虽然不同，但是，友谊的纽带把大家连在一起。
    吴学谦代表中国青年说：英国和中国都是世界大国，让我们两国青年在维护和平的事业中携起手来。
