Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 25th: The Polish Press Agency reported that the Security Bureau of the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs recently arrested a spy named Weska, who was dispatched to Poland by the West Berlin office of the U.S. Department of Defense's Military Intelligence Agency to conduct espionage activities.

Weska is a West German citizen who had previously committed economic crimes. After escaping to Sweden last year, he managed to infiltrate Poland and impersonated a Swedish citizen. Last summer, he went to West Berlin and established contact with personnel from the American intelligence agency. He received espionage training there and was then sent back to Poland to carry out espionage activities. He also attempted to establish a spy organization.

He was arrested while trying to go to West Berlin after collecting intelligence materials. Polish security personnel found intelligence written in invisible ink on his person, containing important information about Poland's national defense. During the interrogation, documents containing the instructions and espionage tasks he had received were also seized.

    波兰逮捕一美国间谍
    新华社华沙25日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰内务部保安处最近逮捕了美国国防部军事情报局西柏林办事处派遣到波兰来进行间谍活动的一个特务，名叫韦斯卡。
    韦斯卡是一个曾经犯有经济罪行的西德公民。他在去年逃到瑞典后设法混入波兰，并且冒充瑞典公民。去年夏天他去西柏林时同美国情报机关人员建立了联系，在那里受了间谍训练，然后被派回波兰进行间谍活动。他还曾经企图建立间谍组织。
    他是在搜集到谍报材料后试图前往西柏林的时候被逮捕的。波兰保安人员在他身上搜出了用密写药水写的关于波兰国防重要情报的谍报。在侦讯期间还查获了他所接受的指令和间谍任务文件等。
