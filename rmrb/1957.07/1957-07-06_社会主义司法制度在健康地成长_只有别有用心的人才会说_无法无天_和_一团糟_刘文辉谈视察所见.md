    The socialist judicial system is growing healthily.
    Only those with ulterior motives would say "lawlessness" and "a mess."
    Liu Wenhui discusses observations from inspection

    I completely agree with Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," as well as the various reports by Vice Premier Li, Vice Premier Bo, Procurator-General Zhang, President Dong, and Vice Chairman Peng.

    This time, I inspected various judicial departments in Sichuan, successively visiting the Department of Justice, Higher People's Court, Procuratorate, Department of Public Security, Legal Advisory Office, Notary Office, as well as detention centers, prisons, and labor reform printing plants. I would now like to give a brief report on the true situation and my own experiences from the inspection.

    During the inspection, what impressed me most was the People's Assessor system. The vast majority of People's Assessors are directly elected by the people, with a small portion recommended by institutions, organizations, enterprises, and factories. Sichuan province has now developed to 40,729 people, and Chengdu city currently has 1,174 people. During their two-year term, they take turns on duty, 15 days in urban areas and 10 days in suburban areas. Their representation is very broad, representing all strata of society and various occupations, directly participating in the court's trial work, powerfully combating counter-revolutionaries, punishing criminal offenders, and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the people. Based on our actual observation of trials and feedback from the assessors' symposium, not only are the assessors given due respect, realizing equal power with the judges, but also all the assessors can competently and happily perform their duties. Although some of them have low levels of education and cannot read case files, they can understand the case and offer opinions with the help of the court and judges. Moreover, because they come from the people, are familiar with public sentiment, and have close ties with the masses, it is easy for them to understand the situation and investigate the facts, which not only makes the trial more correct, but also expands the influence of law-abiding behavior among the masses, educates the masses about the law, and reduces crime and disputes among the masses, playing a role in preventing crime and disputes. These are all evidenced by living facts. To save time, I will only give one example. In a section of Chengdu's Dongcheng District, there were seven divorce cases in a short period of time. The assessors contacted the local mediation committee, neighbors, and the masses to learn more, and then analyzed and researched with the judges, believing that it was mainly caused by living conditions, coupled with a lack of legal awareness. Couples would go to court to request a divorce if there was a slight dispute between them. Therefore, the assessors suggested choosing one case for public trial on the spot and conducting education. At the end of the trial, it was determined that the conditions were not met for divorce. There were two or three hundred people participating in the trial, and everyone was satisfied, thinking that the handling was appropriate, and the other six cases were automatically withdrawn. In addition, some residents who had marital discord have since reconciled.

    Secondly, the duties of the People's Lawyers, now undertaken by the newly established Legal Advisory Office, not only provide convenience to the people and help improve the strength of trials, but are also a powerful assistant for publicizing legal compliance to citizens, and an effective way to reduce disputes, prevent crime, and strengthen internal unity among the people. For example, in Chengdu last year, there were 415 people who inquired and automatically did not file a lawsuit after receiving an answer. The Notary Office has also had a certain effect in preventing disputes.

    At all levels of courts, procuratorates, and public security departments, the tasks stipulated by various organizational laws and arrest and detention regulations have been basically completed in terms of mutual restriction and mutual supervision. For example, in addition to timely combating counter-revolutionaries and bad elements, so that sabotage and suspected sabotage accidents have decreased by 82% in the past year, and various types of criminal cases have decreased by 43.6%, the public security departments generally act in accordance with the law and accept the investigation supervision of the procuratorate. The procuratorate can also be realistic in performing its various supervisory duties. For example, last year, the public security departments in Sichuan province requested approval for the arrest of 27,395 people, and the procuratorate, based on the government's more lenient policy on counter-suppression work, only approved the arrest of 9,240 people. The Higher People's Court reviewed 89 death sentences, and only approved 19 of them because of the new lenient policy. This shows, on the one hand, the conscientious practice of mutual restriction and mutual supervision, and on the other hand, it shows that the relevant judicial organs at all levels have implemented the spirit of seeking truth from facts in the legal system. We have witnessed the Higher People's Court showing a very cautious attitude in all aspects of the review of death sentences, and every detail of the case has been repeatedly considered to ensure that it does not violate the facts, reason, or the law.

    In terms of labor reform, the comrades in charge of prisons and labor reform organs basically carry out reform according to the principle of "education first, production second," and allocate labor according to specific possibilities. Regarding old, weak, sick, disabled, and female prisoners who cannot work, Sichuan granted parole, early release, medical parole, and extra-mural execution to 3,660 people by the end of last year. The prisons and labor reform printing plants we saw this time are truly well taken care of in terms of medical and health care and living conditions. The proportion of labor reform prisoners who have changed from not being able to work to being skilled in labor is very large, and through the combination of punishment and reform, and the combination of labor production and political education, the vast majority have recognized their crimes and abandoned their counter-revolutionary positions. In addition to exposing counter-revolutionary clues and handing over hidden weapons, they have also put forward rationalization proposals for production, of which 31 have been promoted to the entire province by relevant departments. There are also many prisoners who apply to remain in their original labor reform units as employees after serving their sentences, which shows that the labor reform prisoners are very happy to be engaged in appropriate labor.

    Since the promulgation of the Constitution, the People's Court Organization Law, the People's Procuratorate Organization Law, the Arrest and Detention Regulations, and other laws, the institutions and systems of the relevant judicial departments have been rapidly established and are gradually growing vigorously. All of the above achievements, except for those right-wing elements with ulterior motives, will not be denied by anyone.

    However, there are still some shortcomings. For example, some cadres have not received professional training. Only 36.2% of the judicial cadres in Sichuan province have received professional legal training. Among the 2,459 procuratorial cadres in the province, only 186 have received specialized legal education, and only 460 have received short-term business training. Generally, there is a feeling of unfamiliarity with the work and a lack of legal knowledge, which affects the quality of trials. For example, in the concluded cases accepted by the Higher People's Court: only 26.5% of the criminal cases upheld the original judgment, 44% of civil cases, 46.6% of criminal cases sent back for retrial after handling appeals, and 30.7% of civil cases. In retrial cases, 30% of criminal cases were acquitted. And the speed of the trial is not very high. All of these shortcomings should be improved.

    Despite some shortcomings in our people's judicial work, if we compare it with the judicial situation in the old society, there is a world of difference. "The yamen faces south, and if you have reason but no money, don't come in." These two sentences give a general evaluation of the judicial situation for thousands of years before liberation. Not to mention that the laws of the exploiting classes were originally for the service of the exploiting classes, only to say that bribery and mutual protection among officials were rampant in the judicial organs at that time. Today, the situation of corruption and selling cases has completely disappeared, and even our enemies cannot but admit this iron fact. In the past, many lawyers were profit-seeking and chose the best prey. Today's lawyers have basically established the spirit of serving the people and have become a powerful assistant in strengthening the rule of law. Everyone knows the dark and cruel situation in prisons in the past. But today, I have personally seen that the general prisoners in prisons and labor camps are not only full of energy and strong in physique, but those who have no culture have also learned culture, and those who have no skills have learned skills. Everyone said, "We are not sitting in prison, we are simply living in school." As for the People's Assessor system, which embodies the socialist spirit of democracy, it is something that has never appeared in the past.

    However, at present, there is a countercurrent in the rectification movement. Some right-wing elements are deliberately looking for some mistakes in judicial work, deliberately exaggerating some shortcomings in the judicial field, saying that it is "lawless" and describing it as "a mess," which is simply a provocative slander against the hardworking and sincere judicial workers across the country. These people's opinions do not proceed from the interests of the 600 million people, do not proceed from the desire for unity between the party and the masses, and do not proceed from objectively existing facts, but have ulterior motives, attempting to negate all achievements and weaken the prestige of the party in order to abolish the leadership of the party and pull the people back from the broad road of socialism to the dead end of capitalism. This is not only intolerable to the vast majority of the people, but even if you ask the labor reform prisoners, they will unanimously and resolutely oppose it. I have nothing else to say to these right-wing elements, but I hope they "rein in at the edge of the cliff," otherwise they will "regret it too late."

    As for some comrades who, out of the desire to improve their work, put forward the opinion that the legal system should be strengthened. I think this opinion is basically correct and timely. But if it is overemphasized that the shortcomings and mistakes of our state organ cadres - especially party members - are all caused by the lack of a complete codified law and judicial system, as if if there had been a complete codified law and judicial system at the beginning of the founding of the country, perhaps most of the shortcomings and mistakes would not have occurred. I think it would be very incorrect to have this view.

    First of all, I think that the reasons for the shortcomings and mistakes of party member cadres are mainly two: one is that the non-working class ideology left over from the old society continues to invade them, and the other is that their own efforts are not enough to adapt to the too rapid development of the objective new situation. As for the lack of a complete codified law and judicial system, it is definitely not the main reason for the shortcomings and mistakes.

    Secondly, we should know that it was impossible to have a complete codified law and judicial system at the beginning of the founding of the country. Everyone knows that the legal system is the superstructure, and the new superstructure develops with the development of the new foundation - the sum of production relations. Before the basic completion of the three major transformations in our country, the new foundation had not been completely laid, so we could only formulate various regulations in succession according to the objective situation, such as the Land Law and the Marriage Law, and it was impossible to produce a complete code of codified law. These superstructures cannot be conjured up like magic tricks. They all have their own conditions and laws of generation and growth. Now, looking at the situation of the departments related to the people's judicial work that I have inspected this time, I think that our country's socialist judicial system is gradually growing healthily. As for the complete codified law, it will gradually meet the people of the whole country in the near future. Once these new superstructures are produced and grown up, they will become the greatest dynamic force, actively helping the formation and consolidation of their own foundation. That is to say, actively help the socialist economic base to be formed and consolidated quickly. Therefore, I am full of confidence and very optimistic about the future of judicial work and legal science for socialist construction.

    社会主义司法制度在健康地成长
    只有别有用心的人才会说“无法无天”和“一团糟”
    刘文辉谈视察所见
    我完全同意周总理的“政府工作报告”，以及李副总理、薄副总理、张检察长、董院长、彭副委员长的各项报告。
    这次我在四川视察的是有关司法的各个部门，先后视察了司法厅、高级法院、检察院、公安厅、法律顾问处、公证处以及看守所、监狱、劳改印刷所等处。现在把视察所得的真实情况和自己的一点体会作一个简略的报告。
    在视察中给我印象最深的是人民陪审制度。人民陪审员绝大部分由人民群众直接选举，少部分由机关、团体、企业、工厂等推选。四川一省现已发展到四万零七百二十九人，成都市现有一千一百七十四人。他们在两年的任期中，每年轮值，城区十五天，郊区十天。他们的代表性是非常广泛的，代表着各阶层各种不同的职业，直接参加法院的审判工作，协助法院有力地打击了反革命，制裁了刑事犯，保障了人民的正当权益。根据我们实际观审与召开陪审员座谈会的反映，不仅陪审员得到应有的尊重，实现了与审判员同等的权力，并且各陪审员都能胜任愉快。虽然其中有的文化较低不能阅卷，但经法院和审判员的帮助，都能明了案情，提出意见。并且因为他们来自民间，熟悉民情，与群众有密切联系，便于了解情况，调查事实，不特使审判更加正确，同时在群众中扩大了遵守法制的影响，教育了群众对法律的认识，减少了群众的犯罪和纠纷，起到了预防犯罪和纠纷的作用。这些都是有活生生的事实为证，为了节省时间，我只举一个例子。成都东城区的一个地段，在短时间内接连就有七个离婚案。陪审员找到当地调解委员会、邻居和群众详细了解，再同审判员分析研究，认为主要由于生活情况引起，加上法律观念不强，夫妇间稍有争执，便告到法院要求离婚。因此陪审员建议，选择一案就地公开审判，并进行教育。审理终结，认为条件不够，不能离婚。当时参加的群众有二、三百人，大家都满意，认为处理恰当，其他六案自动撤回。另外有些夫妇不和的居民也就从此和好了。
    其次，人民律师的职务，现由初办的法律顾问处来担任，不特便利人民，帮助提高审判力量，并且也是对公民守法宣传教育的有力助手，也是减少纠纷、防止犯罪、加强人民内部团结的有效方法。例如成都市去年就有四百一十五件询问的当事人，经过解答后，即自动地不进行诉讼了。在预防纠纷方面，公证处也发生了一定的效力。
    各级法院、检察院、公安部门在互相制约、互相监督上，基本上完成了各项组织法和逮捕拘留条例所规定的任务。如公安部门除及时打击反革命分子和坏分子，使一年来的破坏和破坏嫌疑事故下降百分之八十二，各类刑事案件下降百分之四十三点六外，一般做到依法办事，接受检察院的侦察监督。检察院在实行各项监督的职务上，也能实事求是。例如去年四川全省公安部门提请批准逮捕者为二万七千三百九十五人，检察院根据政府肃反工作的更加宽大的政策，仅仅批准逮捕九千二百四十人。高级法院对死刑复核八十九人，也因为根据新的宽大政策，只核准十九人。这就一方面说明互相制约、互相监督的认真实践，另方面说明各级有关司法的机关贯彻了实事求是的法制精神。我们目睹高级法院对于死刑复核各方面都表现出非常慎重的态度，案情的一枝一节都经过反复推敲，务求达到于事、于理、于法皆不违背。
    就劳动改造来说，主管监狱及劳动改造机关的同志，基本上是根据“教育第一，生产第二”的原则来进行改造，并且按照具体的可能性来分配劳动。关于老、弱、病、残、女犯等不能劳动的，四川于去年底给予假释、提前释放、保外就医、监外执行的已达三千六百六十人。我们此次所见的各监狱及劳改印刷所，在医疗卫生及生活待遇等方面都是真正得到妥善的照顾。而劳改的人犯，不仅由不会劳动而变为熟练劳动的比例很大，并且经过惩办与改造相结合和劳动生产与政治教育相结合的措施，绝大多数都认识了自己的罪恶，放弃了反革命的立场，除揭发反革命线索，交出隐藏的武器而外，还纷纷提出生产上的合理化建议，经有关部门向全省推广的就有三十一件。还有不少的犯人，刑满后申请仍然留在原劳改单位作为职工，这就可见劳改的人犯都是很愉快地在进行适当的劳动。
    自从宪法、人民法院组织法、人民检察院组织法、逮捕拘留条例等等法律先后颁布以来的短时期内，有关司法各部门的机构和制度都已迅速地建立起来，并且生气勃勃地在逐渐成长。以上种种成绩，除了别有用心的右派分子而外，无论何人，都是不会加以否定的。
    但是同时也还存在着一些缺点。例如有些干部还没有受过专业训练，四川全省司法干部受过法律专业训练的只占百分之三十六点二。全省检察干部二千四百五十九人中，受过专门法律教育的只一百八十六人，受过短期业务训练的仅四百六十人。一般感觉到业务生疏，法律知识缺乏，因而影响到审判的质量，例如高级法院受理上诉的已结案件：维持原判的刑事案仅占百分之二十六点五，民事案占百分之四十四，处理申诉案发回再审的刑事案占百分之四十六点六，民事案占百分之三十点七，再审案件刑事改判无罪的占百分之三十。并且审判的速度也不太高。所有这些缺点都是应当努力改善的。
    尽管我们的人民司法工作还存在着一些缺点，但是如果拿来和旧社会的司法情况相比，那就真有天渊之别。“衙门向南开，有理无钱休进来”，这两句话就把解放前几千年的司法情况给予了一个总的评价。不说剥削阶级的法律，本来就是为剥削阶级服务的，只说当时司法机关的贿赂公行，官官相卫。今天贪污卖案的情况已经完全绝迹，就是我们的敌人，也不能不承认这个铁的事实。过去很多律师的唯利是图，择肥而噬。今天的律师们已经基本上树立起为人民服务的精神，成为加强法治的有力助手。过去监狱里黑暗残酷的情况，这是人人尽知的。而今天我亲眼看见一般监狱和劳改的人犯，一个个不但精神饱满，体格坚强，并且没有文化的还学到文化，没有技术的学到技术，大家都说：“我们不是在坐监，我们简直在住学校。”至于今天体现社会主义民主精神的人民陪审制度，更是过去从来没有出现过的事情。
    但是目前，整风运动中出现了一股逆流。有些右派分子故意在找寻司法工作中的一些错误，故意在夸大司法范围内的一些缺点，说成是“无法无天”，形容成“一团糟”，这简直是对全国辛勤诚恳的司法工作者进行挑衅式的诬蔑。这些人的意见，不是从六亿人民的利益出发，不是从党群团结的愿望出发，不是从客观存在的事实出发，而是别有用心，企图否定一切成绩，削弱党的威信，以便取消党的领导，把人民从社会主义的康庄大道拉回头去走向资本主义的死胡同。这不但为绝大多数的人民群众所不容，就是去问劳改犯人，他们也会异口同声坚决反对的。我对于这些右派分子，没有别的话可说，只是希望他们“临崖勒马”，不然就“后悔莫及”了。
    至于有些同志从改进工作的愿望出发，提出应当加强法制的意见。我认为这种意见基本上是正确的，而且是适时的。但是如果过分强调地说，我们国家机关干部——首先是党员的缺点和错误，都是由于没有完整的成文法律和司法制度所产生的，好像在建国之初，如果早有一套完整的成文法律和司法制度，也许绝大部分的缺点和错误都将不会产生。我认为如果有这种看法，那是很不正确的。
    首先，我认为党员干部的缺点和错误产生的原因主要是两种：一种是旧社会遗留下来的非工人阶级思想不断地向他们侵袭，一种是他们自己的努力不够，不能适应客观新形势太快的发展。至于没有完整的成文法律和司法制度却绝对不是产生缺点和错误的主要原因。
    其次，我们应当知道，在建国之初，就不可能有一套完整的成文法律和司法制度。大家都知道，法律制度是上层建筑，新的上层建筑是随着新的基础——生产关系的总和的发展而发展的。我国在三大改造没有基本完成以前，新的基础还没有完全奠定，因此只能依据客观情况陆续制订各种法规，如土地法、婚姻法等，不可能产生整套的完备的成文法典。这些上层建筑也不能像变戏法一样眨个眼睛就可以变出来的，都有它们各自产生和成长的条件和规律。现在就我这次视察到的人民司法工作有关各部门的情况来看，我认为我国的社会主义司法制度是正在健康地逐渐成长。至于完整的成文法典，在不久的将来也会逐步地和全国人民见面。当这些新的上层建筑一旦产生和成长起来，它就要成为最大的能动力量，积极帮助自己基础的形成和巩固。也就是说积极帮助社会主义的经济基础很快地形成和巩固起来。因此，我对于司法工作和法律科学对于社会主义建设的前途，都是满怀信心和非常乐观的。
