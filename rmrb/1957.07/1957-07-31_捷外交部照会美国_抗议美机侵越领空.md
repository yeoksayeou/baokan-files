    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 30th. According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 29th, the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry handed a note to the U.S. Embassy in Prague, protesting the intrusion of U.S. military aircraft into Czechoslovak airspace.

    The note pointed out that at 12:08 on July 27th of this year, two U.S. military aircraft flew from West Germany and intruded into Czechoslovak airspace in the Klenčí area at the foot of Čerchov Mountain, flying all the way to the vicinity of Prague. After flying for twenty-eight minutes, the two aircraft entered Austrian territory ten kilometers east of Vratěnín. Two other U.S. aircraft, flying from West Germany, intruded into Czechoslovak territory in the Přední Zvonková area at 12:11, and left Czechoslovak territory at 12:16 from the Dolní Dvořiště area. Subsequently, these two aircraft again intruded into Czechoslovak airspace from Austrian territory in the Bratislava area.

    The note further pointed out that the above circumstances prove that this was an intentional violation of Czechoslovak airspace for the purpose of gathering intelligence. The deep intrusion of U.S. military aircraft into Czechoslovak airspace and their stay within Czechoslovak territory for some time rule out the possibility of accidental overflight; moreover, they did not act in accordance with the signals emitted by a Czechoslovak aircraft using red light.

    The Foreign Ministry's note pointed out that Czechoslovakia had previously lodged protests with the United States on many occasions, and the U.S. authorities had also guaranteed that they would take action to prevent the recurrence of incidents of this nature.

    According to the instructions of the Czechoslovak government, the Foreign Ministry strongly protested the repeated and blatant violations of Czechoslovak airspace by U.S. military aircraft and demanded that immediate and necessary measures be taken to effectively prevent the occurrence of any such incidents.

    捷外交部照会美国
    抗议美机侵越领空
    新华社布拉格30日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社29日讯：捷克斯洛伐克外交部交给美国驻布拉格大使馆一份照会，抗议美国军用飞机侵犯捷克斯洛伐克的领空。
    照会指出，今年7月27日十二时零八分，两架美国军用飞机从西德境内飞来，在切尔霍夫山麓克伦齐地区侵入捷克斯洛伐克领空，一直飞到布拉格附近。这两架飞机在飞行了二十八分钟以后，在佛拉特宁以东十公里的地方飞入奥地利国境。另外两架从西德境内飞来的美国飞机，十二时十一分在普雷德尼兹冯科瓦地区侵入捷克斯洛伐克国境，在十二时十六分从多耳尼德沃里斯特地区飞离捷克斯洛伐克国境。接着，这两架飞机又在布拉迪斯拉发地区从奥地利境内侵入捷克斯洛伐克领空。
    照会接着指出，上述情况证明，这是为了收集情报而有意侵犯捷克斯洛伐克领空的。美国军用飞机深入地侵入捷克斯洛伐克领空，在捷克斯洛伐克境内停留了一些时候，这就排除了偶然飞越的可能性；而且，它们没有按照捷克斯洛伐克的一架飞机用红光向它们发出的信号行事。
    外交部的照会指出，捷克斯洛伐克以前曾经多次向美国提出抗议，而且美国当局也曾经保证采取行动来防止这类性质的事件继续发生。
    外交部根据捷克斯洛伐克政府的指示，坚决抗议美国军用飞机屡次不断地公然侵犯捷克斯洛伐克领空的行为，并且要求立即采取必要的措施来有效地防止发生任何这类事件。
