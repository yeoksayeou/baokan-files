Anshan Daily Exposes Rightist Elements Within the Newspaper
Li Huizhong Uses Party Newspaper to Attack the Party

    This newspaper reports: According to the Liaoning Daily, all staff members of the Anshan Daily held continuous meetings from July 15th to 17th, exposing the crimes of rightist element and Deputy Editor-in-Chief Li Huizhong, who colluded with editors Hou Yun, Xue Mai, Gao Wei, Zhang Shi, Liu Mu, and You Qingxin to use the newspaper to attack the Party.
    On May 14th, Anshan City's journalists organized a forum, requesting more support from all sides for journalists' interviewing activities. These requests were originally reasonable, and the Municipal Party Committee supported them, and a news report could be published. However, Li Huizhong and others took the opportunity to write a news piece that named and criticized many cadres, essentially attacking the Municipal Party Committee, and prepared to publish it. The Municipal Party Committee considered this inappropriate and suggested revisions. Li Huizhong and others insisted on not making revisions and took the opportunity to incite the masses, saying, "This is a test of the Municipal Party Committee." Then, Zhang Shi, who had the closest relationship with him, said, "This is a struggle of whether we are men or dogs." Hou Yun and Xue Mai, who were also very close to him, openly called on Party members to betray the Party, saying, "Those who are not afraid of losing their Party membership cards, follow me." The masses did not listen to them. They then cursed the Municipal Party Committee as "stupid," "idiotic," and so on. Afterwards, several responsible comrades from the Municipal Party Committee went to the newspaper office several times to explain to everyone, but rightist element Li Huizhong and others incited the masses not to receive the responsible comrades from the Municipal Party Committee. The Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of the newspaper's editorial board, but Li Huizhong also refused to attend. He also criticized Party members who did not participate in anti-Party activities as being "for the sake of their Party membership cards, wives, and children." He undisguisedly said, "I am not afraid of being expelled from the Party, going to jail, or returning home to farm; I will still have to make revolution in ten years."
    In early June, Li Huizhong, through editors Xue Mai and Hou Yun, who had serious anti-Party sentiments, wantonly slandered the Anshan Municipal Party Committee at a meeting, saying that the Anshan Daily had become a hateful teacher due to the Municipal Party Committee's leadership using dogmatic methods. Ge Peiqi's anti-Party remarks made everyone grind their teeth, but when the vast workers, peasants, soldiers, and patriotic people across the country rose up to refute them, Li Huizhong said, "Ge Peiqi saved the bureaucracy, but those who opposed bureaucracy suffered." During the "blooming and contending" period, Li Huizhong was responsible for the third page, and he took the opportunity to publish a large number of articles, poems, and cartoons attacking the Party. The article "Why Are You So Quiet!" written by a person named Zhu Gezhou, which was published in the top column of the third page on May 25th, is the most typical example. The poem openly pointed to the Anshan Daily and the Anshan Municipal Party Committee, saying, "Anshan Daily, ah, Anshan Daily, why are you so quiet! Is it that the winds of Anshan lack the necessity for reporting, or is someone using their hands to strangle your throat?" On the same day, there was also a short article titled "We Need a Prosperous Spring," which highly praised the "Wenhui Daily's" bourgeois political orientation and its reports attacking the Party, saying, "When will spring come to Anshan?" Li Huizhong also personally organized or instructed the newspaper's art staff to draw some cartoons, many of which were full of poison. One was a half-sky with a hot sun hanging, an old cadre squatting in the sunlight, holding an umbrella. Under the cadre's feet were some flowers, and he used the umbrella to shield the sun tightly, hindering the blooming of the "flowers."
    Now, Li Huizhong's reactionary face has been initially exposed, and attendees unanimously demanded that he thoroughly confess his anti-Party words and deeds.

    鞍山日报揭露社内右派分子
    李惠众利用党报向党进攻
    本报讯　据辽宁日报报道：鞍山日报全体工作人员于7月15至17日连日集会，揭发右派分子、副总编辑李惠众串连编辑侯韵、薛麦、高伟、张实、刘穆和游庆新等人，利用报纸向党进攻的罪行。
    5月14日，鞍山市新闻工作者组织座谈，要求各方面给予记者的采访活动以更多的支持。这些要求本来是合理的，市委也支持，也可以发消息。可是李惠众等人却趁机写出一篇点名批评了很多干部，实质上是攻击市委的新闻，准备发表。市委认为这样做不甚合适，提出修改意见。李惠众等却坚持不愿修改，并乘机煽动群众说：“这是对市委一次考验。”接着，和他关系最密切的张实说：“这是我们做人还是做狗的斗争。”和他关系最密切的侯韵、薛麦则更公开要求党员叛党，说：“不怕丢党票的都跟我走。”群众并没有听他们的话。他们便骂市委“愚蠢”，“混蛋”等等。事后，市委几位负责同志几次到报社准备向大家解释，但右派分子李惠众等煽动群众不要接见市委负责同志。市委召集报社的编委会议，李惠众也拒绝参加。他还批评没有参加反党活动的党员是“为了党票，老婆孩子。”并毫不掩饰地说：“我不怕开除党籍，蹲班房、回家种地都行，十年后还得让我革命。”
    6月上旬，李惠众通过有严重反党情绪的编辑薛麦和侯韵在会上大肆污蔑中共鞍山市委，说：鞍山日报由于市委用教条主义方法领导，已经变成一个面目可憎的教师爷。葛佩琦的反党言论人人切齿，可是当各地广大工人、农民、士兵以及爱国人士起来驳斥的时候，李惠众却说：“葛佩琦救了官僚主义的驾，反官僚主义的人却遭了殃。”在“鸣放”期间，李惠众分工负责第三版，他趁机编发了大量向党进攻的文章、诗歌和漫画。5月25日三版头栏刊登的一个叫朱歌舟写的“你为何这样静悄悄！”就是最典型的一例。诗的一开头就明目张胆地指鞍山日报以及鞍山市委说：“鞍山日报啊鞍山日报，你为何这样静悄悄！究竟是鞍山的风缺少报道的必要，还是有人用手把你的咽喉卡住了？”同一天报上还有一篇题为“我们需要一个繁荣的春天”的短文，对“文汇报”的资产阶级政治方向和向党进攻的报道大加推崇赞扬，说：“春天什么时候降临鞍山呢？”李惠众还亲自组织或者授意报社美术工作人员画了一些漫画，其中很多是毒气十足的。有一付是半天挂着一个火热的太阳，阳光下蹲着一位老干部，撑着伞，这个干部脚下有些花，他用伞把阳光遮得严严实实，妨碍了“花”的放。
    现在，李惠众的反动面目已经被初步揭穿了，到会人员一致要求他彻底交代自己的反党言行。
