    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 1st: The first modern vertical shaft mine built in Northwest China, the Sanlidong Vertical Shaft of the Tongchuan Coal Mine, was officially put into production today. This new type of vertical shaft mine, with an annual production capacity of 600,000 tons of coal, will produce 140,000 tons of coal for the Shaanxi region this year. This coal will mainly supply factories and mines along the Longhai Railway in Shaanxi Province.
    Construction of the Sanlidong Vertical Shaft, located in the Tongchuan mining area of the Weibei Coalfield, began in August 1954 and took thirty-five months to complete. Although coal was discovered in this mining area as early as the 1440s, and small coal kilns were opened during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, the Kuomintang government also successively established old-fashioned and backward small coal mines from 1927 onwards. However, by the eve of liberation, the annual output of this mining area only reached about 300,000 tons. After liberation, the annual output of the newly built Sanlidong Vertical Shaft in this mining area is twice as large as the output of the Kuomintang's twenty-two years of mine construction. The current production level of the Tongchuan mining area has also expanded more than twice that time. If the annual output of the Taoyuan adit and Wangjiahe vertical shaft, which are under construction, are added, the increase will be nearly eight times that of the twenty-two years before liberation.
    Today, trains on the Xianyang-Tongchuan railway line transported coal extracted from the Sanlidong Vertical Shaft for the first time. The Sanlidong Vertical Shaft will serve the industry of Shaanxi for seventy or eighty years.

    三里洞竖井出煤
    据新华社西安1日电　西北新建成的第一对现代化竖井——铜川煤矿三里洞竖井，今天正式投入生产。这对年产六十万吨煤炭的新型竖井，今年就可以给陕西地区生产十四万吨煤炭。这些煤炭主要供给陕西省陇海铁路沿线的工矿使用。
    1954年8月动工兴建的三里洞竖井，共建了三十五个月。它建在渭北煤田上的铜川矿区。这个矿区虽在公元十五世纪四十年代就发现了煤，在明朝嘉靖年间就开了小煤窑；从1927年起国民党统治时期虽然也陆续建立了旧式落后的小煤矿，但是到解放前夕，这个矿区的年产量才达到三十万吨左右。解放以后这个矿区新建的三里洞竖井的年产量就比国民党建矿二十二年的产量大一倍。今年铜川矿区现有生产水平也比那时扩大了两倍多。如果加上正在施工的桃园平洞和王家河竖井年产量计算，将比解放前二十二年增加近八倍。
    今天咸阳——铜川铁路线上的火车，第一次把三里洞竖井采出的煤运出来。三里洞竖井将要为陕西的工业服务七、八十年的时间。
