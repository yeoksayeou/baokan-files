    Attempting to Salvage the Dictatorial Regime
    Franco Reorganizes the Falange
    Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: Spanish dictator Franco is reorganizing his Falange party in order to weaken forces within the party that oppose him and to alleviate the strong dissatisfaction of the Spanish people.
    The Falange is Spain's only legal political party. According to an order signed by Franco and announced on July 27th, many of the party's "national delegations" (equivalent to party leadership organizations at the government ministry level) will be abolished, reducing the number of "national delegations" from the original twenty to eight.
    According to Spanish political figures, the reorganization of the Falange is closely related to Spain's economic and political crisis. Under Franco's dictatorial regime, Spain's economic situation is deteriorating, and large-scale anti-Franco mass demonstrations have erupted in Spain several times in the past two years. This situation is also reflected within the Falange party, with some members expressing dissatisfaction with Franco, which triggered the government crisis this spring. Franco's recently announced plan to restore the monarchy has also aroused dissatisfaction among some influential figures within the Falange.

### 企图挽救独裁政权  佛朗哥改组长枪党

    企图挽救独裁政权
    佛朗哥改组长枪党
    据新华社29日讯　西班牙独裁者佛朗哥正在改组他的长枪党，以便削弱党内反对他的力量，并且缓和西班牙人民的强烈不满。
    长枪党是西班牙的唯一合法政党。根据在7月27日宣布的由佛朗哥签署的一项命令，将撤消党的许多个“全国代表团”（相当于政府部一级的党内领导机构），把“全国代表团”的数目由原来的二十个减少到八个。
    据西班牙政界人士指出，长枪党的改组是和西班牙的经济和政治危机密切相关的。在佛朗哥独裁政权下，西班牙的经济情况愈来愈恶化，近两年来在西班牙几次暴发了反佛朗哥的大规模群众示威。这种情况也反映到长枪党内部来，党内一些人对佛朗哥表示不满，结果触发了今年春天的政府危机。佛朗哥不久前宣布的王室复辟计划，也在长枪党内引起一些有势力人物的不满。
