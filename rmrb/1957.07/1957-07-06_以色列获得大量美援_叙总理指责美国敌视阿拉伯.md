Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 4th: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on July 3rd that the United States is giving a large amount of military and financial aid to the aggressors and plunderers who are hostile to Arab countries, with the aim of pointing the spearhead at the chests of Arab countries and preventing their political and economic development.

Al-Assali made these remarks when commenting on Dulles' remarks at a press conference on July 2nd. He pointed out that the United States had supported the Zionist aggressors against Palestine several years ago, and did not feel ashamed at all. That invasion displaced one million Arabs, leaving them homeless and wandering.

Referring to Dulles' defense of France's atrocities in Algeria, al-Assali said that the United States supports French imperialism in carrying out massacres and horrific wars in Algeria. He accused the United States of wanting to make the Algerian issue a second Palestine.

    以色列获得大量美援
    叙总理指责美国敌视阿拉伯
    新华社大马士革4日电　叙利亚总理阿萨利7月3日说，美国大量给予敌对阿拉伯国家的侵略者和掠夺者以军事和财政援助，目的是要把矛头对准阿拉伯国家的胸口，阻止它们在政治上和经济上的发展。
    阿萨利是在评论杜勒斯7月2日在记者招待会的谈话时这样说的。他指出，美国在几年以前就曾经支持过犹太复国主义者对巴勒斯坦的侵略，而且一点不感到抱愧。那次侵略使一百万阿拉伯人颠沛失所，流落他乡。
    阿萨利在谈到杜勒斯为法国在阿尔及利亚的暴行辩护的谈话时说，美国支持法帝国主义在阿尔及利亚大肆屠杀，进行惨绝人寰的战争。他指责美国要使阿尔及利亚问题成为巴勒斯坦第二。
