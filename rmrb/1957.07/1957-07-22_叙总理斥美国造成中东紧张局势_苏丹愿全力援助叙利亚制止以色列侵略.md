Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, Damascus Dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on July 20th: It is the United States, not the Soviet Union, that is creating tension in the Middle East.

Eisenhower recently blamed the Soviet Union's arms supply for causing disputes in the Middle East at a press conference. Al-Assali's remarks were in response to his accusation.

Al-Assali told the press: "The actual situation is exactly the opposite. The real reason for the disputes in the Middle East is the large amount of military and financial aid that the United States gives to Israel. Encouraged by this aid, Israel has carried out hundreds of acts of aggression against Arabs."

Al-Assali said: Syria and Egypt purchased weapons from socialist countries "purely for self-defense."

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 21st: According to the "Masses Newspaper" on July 20th, Syrian Army Chief of Staff Nizam al-Din said that the arms purchase agreement signed between Syria and Czechoslovakia was purely commercial in nature and had no strings attached. The Chief of Staff said that Syria turned to a policy of obtaining weapons from socialist countries in October 1955. In the two years prior to this, Syria had tried to purchase weapons from the West, but was rejected.

Xinhua News Agency, July 21st, Damascus Dispatch: Sudanese Minister to Syria, Ahmed, said on July 20th that Sudan is prepared to provide "all possible assistance to help Syria stop any future Israeli attacks."

Ahmed said that he made this promise during discussions with Syrian Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Tarazi.

Ahmed said that Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil is drafting "a practical plan aimed at eliminating internal Arab divisions."

    叙总理斥美国造成中东紧张局势
    苏丹愿全力援助叙利亚制止以色列侵略
    新华社21日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利7月20日说：造成中东紧张局势的是美国，而不是苏联。
    艾森豪威尔最近曾经在记者招待会上指责苏联提供的武器引起了中东地区的纠纷。阿萨利的话就是针对他的指责而发的。
    阿萨利对报界说：“实际情况恰恰相反。造成中东纠纷的真正原因是美国给以色列的大量军事和财政援助。以色列受到这种援助的鼓励对阿拉伯进行了成百次的侵略活动。”
    阿萨利说：叙利亚和埃及从社会主义国家购买武器“仅仅是为了自卫”。
    据新华社大马士革21日电　据7月20日的“群众报”说，叙利亚陆军参谋长尼扎姆丁说，叙利亚同捷克斯洛伐克签订的购买武器协定纯粹是商业性质的，没有附带任何条件。这位参谋长说，叙利亚转而采取从社会主义国家获得武器的政策是在1955年10月。在这以前的两年间，叙利亚曾经设法从西方购买武器，但是遭到了它们的拒绝。
    新华社21日讯　大马士革消息：苏丹驻叙利亚公使艾哈迈德7月20日说，苏丹准备提供“一切可能的援助来帮助叙利亚制止以色列将来的任何进攻。”
    艾哈迈德说，他是在和叙利亚外交部秘书长塔拉齐进行商谈的时候提出这个诺言的。
    艾哈迈德说，苏丹总理哈利勒正在起草“一项实际可行的计划，这项计划的目的是消除阿拉伯内部的分歧。”
