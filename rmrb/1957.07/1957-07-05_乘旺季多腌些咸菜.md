    Take Advantage of the Peak Season to Pickle More Vegetables

    The peak season for vegetables has arrived. To avoid vegetable stockpiling and spoilage, Beijing's commercial departments, in addition to vigorously organizing sales, also plan to pickle 5.75 million jin of vegetables. Currently, 76 vegetable pits (each pit can pickle more than 20,000 jin) and more than 3,200 large vats (each vat pickles 500 jin of vegetables) have been prepared for pickling vegetables.

    However, the amount of vegetables that the state can pickle is ultimately limited. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal Non-Staple Food Commercial Bureau has mobilized the catering units of various organizations and groups, as well as the general public, to store or pickle more vegetables during this peak season in preparation for the off-season.

    There are more than 830,000 households in Beijing. If each household can pickle some vegetables, the number would be considerable.

    乘旺季多腌些咸菜
    菜蔬的旺季已到，为避免菜蔬积压、腐烂，北京市商业部门除了大力组织推销外，还计划腌制咸菜五百七十五万斤。目前已准备好七十六个菜池（每个菜池可腌二万多斤）、三千二百多口大缸（每口缸腌菜五百斤）作腌菜用。
    但是国家能腌制蔬菜的数量究竟有限，因此北京市副食品商业局已动员各机关、团体的伙食单位及广大市民乘此旺季多储存或腌制一些菜蔬，以备淡季的需要。
    北京全市有八十三万多户居民，如果每户都能腌制一些菜蔬，数字是很可观的。
