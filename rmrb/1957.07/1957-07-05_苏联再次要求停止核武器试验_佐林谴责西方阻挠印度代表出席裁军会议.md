Xinhua News Agency, London, July 3rd: Soviet representative Zorin stated at the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee on July 2nd that the Soviet Union proposes immediately resolving the issue of halting atomic and hydrogen weapons tests, and separating this issue entirely, without linking it to any other matters.

Zorin spoke after British Foreign Secretary Lloyd issued a statement on behalf of the Western Four concerning the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

Zorin expressed satisfaction with the Western countries' representatives' acknowledgement that the Soviet Union's proposal of June 14th opened the way for concluding an agreement to halt atomic and hydrogen weapons tests. However, he pointed out that some of the arguments reflected in the Western countries' statement made it impossible to have a sufficiently clear understanding of the Western countries' attitude on certain fundamental issues. In particular, it was difficult to discern from this statement whether the Western countries agreed to separate the issue of a temporary halt to nuclear weapons tests from other disarmament issues and actively resolve it immediately. It was also difficult to discern whether the Western countries agreed to halt tests for two or three years, or whether they would propose a different time frame. Zorin said that, of course, these are not technical issues, but policy issues. Therefore, the answer to this question should certainly be given here during the discussions of the Disarmament Subcommittee.

Zorin then refuted Lloyd's claim that the recent British hydrogen weapon test "improved the possibility of reaching an agreement." The Soviet delegation could not agree with this statement, considering it completely erroneous and not in the interests of consolidating peace.

Zorin reminded that the issue of the safety of mankind from atomic and hydrogen weapons tests did not arise only from the British test this year, but because the United States conducted a test as early as March 1954. Zorin said that as early as 1955, the Soviet Union raised the issue in the Subcommittee of the need to immediately halt all kinds of atomic and hydrogen weapons tests. At that time, the Western countries generally believed that there was no need to discuss this issue. Now the situation has changed, and the Western countries have concluded that stopping tests, or at least temporarily stopping tests, is possible and even necessary.

Zorin said that the whole world now firmly demands a positive resolution to this issue.

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 2nd: Soviet representative Zorin issued a statement at the United Nations Disarmament Committee Subcommittee meeting on July 2nd, condemning the representatives of Western countries for obstructing the attendance of the Indian representative at the Subcommittee meeting to present his views on disarmament issues.

Zorin said: The Soviet delegation is particularly surprised by the attitude taken by the Western countries, especially considering that the Subcommittee is now immediately beginning to discuss the issue of halting atomic and hydrogen weapons tests, and the Indian government is particularly concerned about resolving this issue, because the Indian government has put forward its proposals, and the United Nations General Assembly has submitted these opinions to us for study. Considering this situation and that the Indian Prime Minister is currently in London, the Soviet delegation believes that listening to the Indian representative's views is particularly appropriate and very realistic at this time. The Soviet delegation regrets very much that the attitude taken by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and other Western countries is hindering India from participating in the Subcommittee. The Soviet delegation can only assess this attitude of the Western countries as an unwillingness to listen in the Subcommittee to the opinions of governments that are not members of the Subcommittee and that are calling for easing international tensions and halting atomic and hydrogen weapons tests. Naturally, this cannot but have a bad influence on the entire work of the Subcommittee.

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 4th: American representative Stassen, who is attending the London disarmament talks, rejected on July 3rd the suggestion made by Soviet representative Zorin to have the Disarmament Subcommittee listen to the opinions of the Indian representative.

Stassen, using the excuse that now is not the time for the Subcommittee to change its rules of procedure, insisted that inviting India to participate would not be helpful to the committee.

### 苏联再次要求停止核武器试验  佐林谴责西方阻挠印度代表出席裁军会议

    苏联再次要求停止核武器试验
    佐林谴责西方阻挠印度代表出席裁军会议
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社伦敦3日讯：苏联代表佐林7月2日在联合国裁军小组委员会上说，苏联建议立即解决关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题，并且把这个问题单独分出来，不同其他任何问题牵涉在一起。
    佐林是在英国外交大臣劳埃德发表西方四国关于停止试验核武器问题的声明后发言的。
    佐林对西方国家代表承认苏联6月14日的建议为缔结停止试验原子武器和氢武器协定开辟了道路这种说法表示满意。但是他指出，西方国家的声明所反映的一些论点，使人对西方国家在某些基本问题的态度上不能有足够清楚的了解。特别是从这个声明中很难看出，西方国家是否同意把暂时停止试验核武器问题从裁军的其他问题中分出来，并且立即积极地加以解决。同时也很难看出，西方国家是否同意在二、三年内停止试验，或者它们将提出另外的期限。佐林说，当然，这并不是技术问题，而是政策问题。所以对这个问题的回答当然应当在裁军小组委员会讨论的时候在这里作出。
    佐林接着驳斥劳埃德的所谓最近英国举行的氢武器试验好像“改善了达成协议的可能性”的说法。苏联代表团不能同意这种说法，认为这种说法是完全错误的而且不符合巩固和平的利益。
    佐林提醒说，试验原子武器和氢武器对人类的安全问题决不是从今年英国进行试验的时候才发生的，而是因为还在1954年3月美国就进行了试验。佐林说，还在1955年，苏联就在小组委员会提出了关于必须立即停止试验各种原子武器和氢武器的问题。当时西方国家笼统地认为讨论这个问题是不需要的。现在情况变了，于是西方国家得出结论说，停止试验或者尽管是暂时停止试验是可能的，而且甚至是必需的。
    佐林说，现在全世界都坚决要求对这一问题作出积极的决议。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社伦敦2日讯：苏联代表佐林2日在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议上发表声明，谴责西方国家的代表阻挠印度代表出席小组委员会会议陈述对裁军问题的意见。
    佐林说：苏联代表团对西方国家所采取的这种态度感到特别惊异，特别是考虑到小组委员会现在紧接着开始讨论关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题，而印度政府却对解决这一问题特别关心，因为印度政府曾提出它的建议，并已由联合国大会把这些意见交给我们研究。考虑到这一情况以及印度总理目前正在伦敦，苏联代表团认为，倾听印度代表的意见在目前是特别合适和十分现实的。苏联代表团感到非常遗憾的是，美国、英国和其他西方国家的代表对这一建议所采取的态度阻碍着印度参加小组委员会。苏联代表团不能对西方国家的这种态度再作另外的估价，只能认为他们不愿在小组委员会中倾听要求缓和国际紧张局势、停止试验原子武器和氢武器的非小组委员会成员国政府的意见，当然，这对小组委员会的整个工作不能不起坏的影响。
    新华社伦敦4日电　出席伦敦裁军谈判的美国代表史塔生3日拒绝了苏联代表佐林提出的主张裁军小组委员会听取印度代表的意见的建议。
    史塔生借口现在不是小组委员会改变议事程序的时候，硬说邀请印度参加对委员会不会有帮助。
