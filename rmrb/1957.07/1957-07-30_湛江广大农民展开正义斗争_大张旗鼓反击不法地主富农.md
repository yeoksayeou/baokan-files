Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 29th: A socialist propaganda and education movement is being carried out in various counties of the Zhanjiang Special District, Guangdong Province, to resolutely crack down on the sabotage activities of a small number of counter-revolutionaries and unlawful landlords and rich peasants.

Recently, encouraged by the reactionary words and deeds of bourgeois rightists in various places, a small number of counter-revolutionaries and unlawful landlords and rich peasants in the rural areas of Zhanjiang Special District have wantonly spread rumors and engaged in sabotage, incited commune members to withdraw from the cooperatives, and even beaten cadres, frantically attempting to settle scores with the peasants. According to statistics from eleven counties, including Haikang, Yangjiang, and Yangchun, there have been 627 instances of unlawful landlords and rich peasants settling scores with the peasants, of which Haikang County alone accounted for 418.

In the past half-month, under the unified leadership of the Zhanjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, various counties in the Zhanjiang Special District have launched a vigorous counterattack against the sabotage activities of remnant counter-revolutionaries and unlawful landlords and rich peasants. In areas where unlawful landlords and rich peasants have been rampant in settling scores with the peasants, mass class struggles have been launched vigorously. In Yangchun County, more than 70,000 farmers participated in the struggle against unlawful landlords, and in Haikang County, the number reached more than 30,000. Many townships in various counties have convened commune member meetings, small-scale discussion meetings, and meetings of poor and lower-middle peasants to conduct socialist education among the peasants. Yangchun County effectively helped peasants calculate three accounts by comparing the achievements and shortcomings of various tasks since liberation; the changes in farmers' lives before and after liberation; the differences between unified purchase and marketing and the capitalist free market; and the future of cooperatives and individual households.

Before launching the socialist propaganda and education movement in rural areas, various counties convened cadre meetings to educate cadres to distinguish between contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, to criticize right-leaning paralysis, and to dispel cadres' concerns about shrinking back and not daring to work boldly, so that cadres' minds gradually became clear.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 29th: People from all walks of life in Haikang County held a rally on the 23rd with the participation of 6,000 people to expose the crimes of rightist Wu Lin (Deputy County Head of Haikang County and head of the Haikang County branch of the China Democratic League) in inciting landlords to launch a counter-offensive and settle scores with the peasants.

According to the revelations at the meeting, shortly after Wu Lin took office as deputy county head, landlord Lin Wenchao wrote a letter to congratulate him, calling him his "most beloved person," saying that they were in the same situation and would share the same fate, and cursed the Communist Party as "murderous and evil, tyrannical, and bound to go bankrupt and die."

With the support of Wu Lin, landlords Lin Zeyi, Tang Dezun, Wu Tianqi, and others were extremely arrogant and demanded houses and rent from farmers everywhere. Lin Zeyi also proclaimed everywhere that he had the support of Deputy County Head Wu Lin, and he banged on the table and cursed cadres at the town's Housing Management Committee. Some landlords threatened farmers menacingly. Some farmers, after being threatened, returned the houses they had exchanged with landlords during the land reform.

The meeting also revealed that Wu Lin appeared as an active implementer of the Communist Party's policy on intellectuals to undermine the relationship between the Communist Party and intellectuals. Wu Lin also raised the banner of caring for intellectuals to complain and plead for landlords, bureaucrats, and criminals. Landlords, former bureaucrats, and released criminals often came and went from his home, and he actively sought positions for these people in government agencies and schools. Wu Lin once wanted to introduce You Geng?, a landlord and local bully who had served as a judge advocate in the Kuomintang's 63rd Army for many years and was now under supervision, to work in a government agency, but he was greatly disappointed when he failed. According to the revelations, Wu Lin tried every means to find a job for released criminal Chen Junwen. Wu Lin also opened a list of more than a dozen people like Chen Junwen and asked the education section to arrange jobs for them. When this list was rejected, Wu Lin became furious and said he was "having the title without power."

The meeting revealed that Wu Lin also consciously violated the policies of the Communist Party and the government on the issue of conducting labor education for graduating students. He spread poison to students and carried out instigation and incitement. At a meeting of the Haikang County People's Committee to deploy teachers to conduct labor education for students, he slandered the agricultural cooperativization movement as not as good as individual farming, and in a discussion with middle school students, he supported the students' mistaken view that participating in agricultural production was a waste of talent. He said: It is "somewhat" a waste of talent for high school students to participate in agricultural production, and he openly believed that high school graduates should "switch shifts" with some government cadres with low education levels.

    湛江广大农民展开正义斗争
    大张旗鼓反击不法地主富农
    据新华社广州29日电　广东省湛江专区各县正在对广大农民展开一个社会主义宣传教育运动，坚决打击少数反革命分子和不法地主、富农的破坏活动。
    最近一时期以来，湛江专区农村的少数反革命分子和不法地主、富农受到各地资产阶级右派分子反动言行的鼓励，大肆造谣破坏，煽动社员退社，甚至殴打干部，猖狂地向农民倒算。据海康、阳江、阳春等十一个县统计，不法地主、富农向农民倒算的事件已发生六百二十七起，其中仅海康县就有四百一十八起。
    近半个月内，湛江专区各县在中共湛江地委统一领导下，对残余反革命分子和不法地主、富农的破坏活动展开了有力的反击。在不法地主、富农向农民倒算猖狂的地区，已经大张旗鼓地开展了群众性的阶级斗争。阳春县各地参加斗争不法地主的农民达七万多人，海康县达三万多人。各县许多乡都召开了社员大会、小型座谈会和贫农、下中农会议，向农民进行社会主义教育。阳春县以对比解放以来各方面工作的成绩大还是缺点多；解放前后农民的生活变化；统购统销和资本主义自由市场的不同情况；合作社和单干户的前途，具体地帮助农民算三笔账，收效很好。
    在农村展开社会主义宣传教育运动以前，各县都召开了干部会议，教育干部分清人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的界限，批判右倾麻痹思想，解除干部缩手缩脚、不敢大胆工作的顾虑，使干部的头脑逐步清醒过来。
    据新华社广州29日电　海康县城乡各界人民在23日举行了一个有六千名群众参加的集会，揭发右派分子吴林（海康县副县长、民盟海康县负责人）煽动地主向农民进行反攻倒算等罪行。
    据会上揭露，吴林担任副县长不久，地主分子林文超就写信向他道贺，称他为“最心爱的人”，说他们处境相同，祸福同当，信中咒骂共产党为“行凶作恶、横行无理之徒，必然走向破产和死亡”。
    在吴林的支持下，地主林则英、唐德尊、吴天齐等气焰万丈，到处向农民要房屋要房租。林则英还到处扬言有副县长吴林支持他，并到城镇房屋管理委员会拍案大骂干部。有些地主声势汹汹地恐吓农民。有的农民受到恐吓后将在土地改革时和地主换的房子调回。
    会上还揭露，吴林以共产党的知识分子政策的积极执行者的姿态出现来破坏共产党和知识分子的关系。吴林还打着关怀知识分子的旗帜为地主官僚罪犯诉苦鸣冤，地主、旧官僚分子和释放的犯人时常出入他的家门，他积极为这些人在政府机关和学校谋职位。吴林曾想把一个担任国民党六十三军军法官多年、现被管制的地主恶霸游庚?，介绍到政府机关工作，后来没有成功，他大为惋惜。据揭露，吴林曾经千方百计替释放犯陈俊文找职业。吴林还开了一个十多个像陈俊文这类人的名单要教育科为他们安排工作。当这个名单被拒绝以后，吴林就大发雷霆，说他是“有职无权”。
    会上揭露，在对应届毕业生进行劳动教育的问题上，吴林也有意识地违背共产党和政府的政策。他向学生散播毒素，进行挑拨、煽动。在海康县人民委员会一次布置教师向学生进行劳动教育的会议上，他污蔑农业合作化运动不如单干好，并在一次和中学生座谈时支持学生认为参加农业生产是大材小用的错误论点。他说：高中生参加农业生产是“有些”大材小用，他公然认为高中毕业生应当同有些文化水平低的机关干部“换班”。
