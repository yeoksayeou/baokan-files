I wholeheartedly support Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report.

Recently, the fallacies of the rightists have pained my heart. Therefore, in addition to participating in the joint statement, I would like to say some words from the bottom of my heart.

Long Yun has consistently been anti-people, and recently, he has been stirring up trouble among our minority nationalities, trying to get us to betray the Communist Party and regress from the path of socialism, back to the old road where he held us by the neck for eighteen years. This is simply a daydream! The notorious Long Yun can no longer deceive us.

**The Tears of Blood of the Lisu People Are Not Yet Dry - Long Yun Can No Longer Deceive People**

We, the people of all nationalities in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, have not yet forgotten the blood and tears under the rule of the Kuomintang – Long Yun. The officials he sent to conquer us were greedy, cruel, and worse than tigers and wolves. The mountains were already poor valleys, and they still had to drain the river to catch fish. Dozens of kinds of levies were collected every day. Debts from this year would accrue interest for the next. There were taxes on raising pigs, taxes on crossing bridges, and even taxes for airplanes flying overhead. Each household had to pay at least sixty silver dollars every year. Lai Huisheng, the puppet county magistrate of Gongshan (said to have originally been Long Yun's opium-smoking attendant), demanded gifts from every household to celebrate his birthday, stipulating that each family had to provide at least one yuan and a chicken. Oxen ploughing in the fields were taken away and slaughtered. Those who failed to pay on time were arrested, imprisoned, and severely beaten. The greedy officials plundered cedar coffins, mountain products, and medicinal materials without compensation, and even forced people to carry them thousands of miles away. When people were reduced to skin and bones, they were still stripped of their skin and marrow. Under any pretext, they would be hung up and extorted. Countless families were ruined and perished. In Sha'ajia Village, Bijiang, thirty-two households sold twenty-one children. In my village, fifteen out of twenty households fled abroad to seek refuge. Two-thirds of the families couldn't afford salt, and five months were spent eating only a hundred catties of corn. The soup was so thin it could be used as a mirror. People gathered wild vegetables, hunted birds, and starvation was everywhere!

We also took risks when we could no longer endure it. On one occasion, we used wooden sticks and stones to beat the puppet county magistrate of Fugong to death. But as a result, Long Yun sent troops to suppress us, burning down over three hundred households, killing and forcing to death two hundred Lisu people. The Xiduo River was filled with maggots on corpses, and water couldn't be drunk for more than a year! Even in normal times, Long Yun's government said we "submit to force but not to virtue," and "don't shed tears until we see the coffin." The lives of the people were worth less than ants in their eyes. A farmer, Labao, spat near a soldier, and was shot dead for saying "dirty thing." Miao A'cizhao went to see an official in national costume with a waist knife, and was beaten to death for "attempting to assassinate."

These tears of blood have not yet dried. If Long Yun dares to come to our Nujiang to talk nonsense, to drag us back to the old path, then we can drown you with the blood and tears you forced out!

**When We Were About to Die of Thirst, the Communist Party Sent Cool Water**

Long Yun resents the entry of the People's Liberation Army into Yunnan, resents the Communist Party's rescue of the people of all nationalities. His heart is as incompatible with ours as water and fire. We, however, hate that the Kuomintang-Long Yun collapsed too late. Why didn't the Communist Party come a few years earlier? After liberation, "orphans and widows found their parents." The government transported large quantities of grain and materials from the interior for relief and to promote unity and production. Startled birds returned to their nests in the forest. The families who had fled gradually returned to settle down. Those suffering in fiery pits and ice cellars escaped! The masses sang: "Salt was cut off for half a year, and Chairman Mao sent salt. When we were about to die of thirst, the Communist Party sent cool water!"

In 1954, the autonomous region was established (renamed a prefecture in January 1957), and life is getting better and better. In the past, "monkeys don't sit on benches, and Lisu don't become officials." But now we are masters of our own affairs. The prefecture has eight hundred and forty-six ethnic minority cadres holding various positions, and more than nine hundred advanced ethnic cadres are helping us, sharing our joys and sorrows. We treat them as sons and daughters of the Nujiang people. Long Yun wants us to reject Han cadres, but that is impossible!

Long Yun wants us to seize the "opportunity of a lifetime," using the name of "regional autonomy" and "self-reliance" to resist the leadership of the Party and establish an independent kingdom. That is like tigers and wolves blocking the sheep's path, and otters trying to separate fish from water. He wants to block our path to development! We are very clear: Long Yun - the Kuomintang devastated our region, reducing it to a barren land, a pile of ruins, and oppressed our minority peoples into poverty and backwardness. Without the leadership of the Party, the support of the state, and the help of advanced nationalities, how can we develop?

In recent years, the government has issued relief loans of about two million yuan. In the previous two years alone, it issued eleven thousand pieces of farm equipment, four million catties of grain, forty-five thousand pieces of winter clothing, and over one thousand head of draft animals. It built five hundred and fifty-nine canals, opened up ten thousand and five hundred mu of terraced fields, and learned how to process fertilizers and replant spring wheat. It also established three farms, two agricultural technology stations, and nine handicraft factories, training over two hundred handicraft workers. Almost every mountain valley has a trading agency. As a result, grain production in the four border counties has increased by 55.3 percent, from an average of 260 catties per person to 404 catties. Sideline income has also increased. The masses say: the leadership of the Communist Party is more intimate than parents helping children walk, and more earnest than farmers tending their crops. In Ekolo Township, two hundred and seventy-five households had only one hundred and forty-one hoes before liberation, but now they have seven hundred and twenty. Before liberation, they had only two hundred and ninety-seven pieces of cloth clothing and one cotton quilt, but now they have one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine pieces of cloth clothing and one hundred and eighty-seven cotton quilts. The masses said: "Now we eat dry rice, and one day's meal is worth three days' grain in the past." In the past, people hid when they saw someone wearing cloth clothes, but now everyone wears them. In the past, people in Nujiang killed livestock and worshiped ghosts when they were sick, and there was nowhere to find medicine. Now there are thirty-one health institutions. In a region with only 120,000 people, more than 330,000 people were treated in 1956 alone. Now we have our own new script, which is being promoted among young and middle-aged people. The original nineteen primary schools, which only forced students to attend and demanded tuition and grain, have now been increased to one hundred and two, educating seven thousand four hundred and eighty-three students. We have also opened the first ethnic middle school, which we never even dreamed of!

The rightists stubbornly refuse to see these achievements, and stubbornly refuse to hear about these changes. On the contrary, they regard these achievements and changes as a "complete mess." That is why Long Yun openly stated that "as for the development after autonomy, I don't think the Communist Party has any solutions." I want to solemnly warn Long Yun: The Communist Party has the most and the best solutions. It is the Kuomintang-Long Yun who had no solutions for development but had solutions for destruction! Since liberation, we have become smarter. We can distinguish wolves from sheep, and we can distinguish honey from poison.

**Farmers of All Nationalities in the Prefecture Have Determined That Cooperativization Is the Road to Happiness**

After 1956, according to the social characteristics of our region, we adopted the method of direct transition, carrying out socialist transformation without land reform. We are very happy: The one hundred and forty-six cooperatives that were built on a trial basis were all successful. Among the first sixty-seven cooperatives to be established on a trial basis, twelve increased production by more than 80%, and the others all increased production to varying degrees. 83% of the members increased their income. The Luchu Luo cooperative in Lushui had an income of ninety-five dan of grain and two hundred and ninety yuan of sideline income in the spring of 1955. In the first year after the cooperative was established, it received two hundred and five point two dan of grain and eight hundred and sixty-four yuan of sideline income in the spring, more than doubling the grain production and nearly tripling the sideline income. Now, the number of farmers joining cooperatives in the four border counties has reached 12.5% of the total number of farm households, and the number of those joining mutual aid groups has reached 60%. I dare to assert that farmers of all nationalities in the prefecture have seen the superiority of cooperatives and have determined that cooperativization is the direction of happiness. The rightists attempt to spread negative sentiments among us, using rumors such as "many cooperatives in the interior are being dissolved," "it may not be suitable for border areas," and "are we moving too fast" to scare us. This will only arouse our infinite indignation and will absolutely not shake our will.

Of course, we will still encounter difficulties in our progress. There are still some shortcomings in our work, such as the remnants of local nationalism and great Han chauvinism among cadres; in the trial establishment of cooperatives, there was insufficient research on the characteristics of nationalities and regions, and there were still defects in the coordination of various tasks, etc. But I want to tell the rightists: These are matters within our people. We have been constantly overcoming them, and in the future we will continue to overcome them in our work and in the rectification movement, according to Chairman Mao's instructions. You don't think you can take advantage of loopholes to sabotage! Grabbing a black wool from a white blanket and insisting that we call the white blanket a black blanket is impossible. A withered grass cannot block the torrent of the river, and no force can block our path!

Fellow representatives: Let us unite closely around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and not allow the rightists to talk and act recklessly, and not allow the rightists to engage in sabotage among minority nationalities. I guarantee: We are willing, under the leadership of the Party, with the support of the national government at all levels, and with the help of advanced nationalities, to advance unswervingly along the socialist road together with the people of all nationalities across the country!

    不准右派分子在少数民族中间捣鬼
    裴阿欠的发言
    毛主席的演讲和周总理的报告，我衷心拥护。
    最近右派分子的谬论，刺痛了我的心，所以我参加联合发言之外，还想说一些心头话。
    龙云一贯反人民，最近还在我们少数民族中间捣鬼，想叫我们背叛共产党，从社会主义的路上倒退回去，退到他卡住我们脖子走了十八年的老路上。这简直是白天做憨梦！恶名昭彰的龙云，再也骗不了我们。
    傈僳族人民血泪未干，龙云再也骗不了人
    我们云南省怒江傈僳族自治州各族人民，直到现在，还没有忘记国民党——龙云统治下的血和泪。他派来征服我们的官员，贪馋凶恶，胜过虎狼。原来就是穷山谷，还要戽干河水来打鱼。几十种派款天天收，今年欠款明年就加利，养猪有税，过桥有税，连飞机飞过去一下也有税，每户每年要出六十多银元。贡山伪县长赖汇生（据说原来是龙的烧烟手），祝自己生日而户户派礼，规定每家起码要出一元钱和一只鸡，正在犁地的耕牛拉去杀吃了，缴款误了期的抓去就监禁毒打；贪官们把杉柏棺木、山货药材，无代价的刮了去，还派白工送背到千里之外。骨头上面只有一层皮了，还要揭去皮子敲骨髓，借个名目就吊打勒索，不知有多少家破人亡的事例：碧江沙阿甲村三十二户就卖了二十一个孩子；我的村子二十户就有十五户人家逃往国外去避难。三分之二的人家吃不上盐巴，五个月只吃一百斤包谷，面汤可以当作镜子照，采野菜，打雀鸟，到处是饿殍！
    我们也曾经在忍无可忍的时候去冒险，有一次就用木棍石块打死了福贡伪县长。但是结果，龙云派兵来剿办，烧光了三百几十户人家，杀死和逼死二百多傈僳族人民，西朵河上飘满了尸体上的蛆，一年多还喝不成水！就在平时，龙云政府说我们“服威不服德”，“不见棺材不掉泪”，人民的生命在他们的心目中还不如蚂蚁：农民腊保在一个军人旁边吐了一口痰，骂声“脏东西”就一枪打死了；妙阿此照民族装束挂着腰刀去见官，就说“企图行凶”被打死了！
    这些血泪还没有干，要是龙云到我们怒江去胡说八道，要拖我们走回头路，那么，就可以用你所逼出来的血泪淹死你！
    就要渴死的时候，共产党送来了凉水
    龙云怨恨解放军进入云南，怨恨共产党救出了各族人民，他的心眼与我们是水火不相容，我们却恨国民党龙云垮的太迟了，共产党为什么不早来几年呢？解放了，
  “孤儿寡女找到了爹娘”，政府从内地运来大批粮食、物资，搞救济，搞团结生产，惊弓之鸟回到树林里栖息了，逃出去的人家陆续回来安居了，在火坑冰窖里受罪的人脱身了！群众歌唱说：“断了半年盐，毛主席送来了盐巴；就要渴死的时辰，共产党送来了凉水”！
    一九五四年成立自治区（一九五七年一月改州），日子越来越好了。过去是“猴子不坐凳，傈僳不做官”，而现在我们当家作主了，全州已经有了八百四十六个民族干部担任各项工作，还有先进民族干部九百余人帮助着我们，与我们同呼吸、共甘苦，我们把他们当作怒江人民的儿女，龙云要我们拒绝汉族干部是做不到的！
    龙云要我们乘“千载一时之机”，借着“区域自治”“自力更生”之名，抗拒党的领导，搞独立王国，那才叫做虎狼拦着羊群的去路，水獭要把鱼和水分开，他想堵死我们发展的前途！我们非常明白：龙云——国民党把我们地区糟蹋成一片赤地，一堆废墟，把我们少数民族人民压迫成贫困又落后。没有党的领导、国家的扶持和先进民族的帮助，叫我们怎么发展呢？
    几年来政府发放了救济贷款约二百万元，单算去前两年就发放了十一万件农具，四百万斤粮食，四万五千件寒衣，一千多头耕畜；兴修了五百五十九条水沟，开了一万零五百亩梯田，学会了加工施肥，复种小春。还设立了三个农场，两个农技站和九个手工业工厂，培养了二百多手工工人，差不多每个山凹里都有了贸易机构。这样，边四县粮食已经增加了百分之五十五点三，由每人平均二百六十斤提高到四百零四斤；副业收入也增加了。群众说：共产党的领导比父母搀着孩子走路还亲切，比种田人招呼庄稼还认真。俄科罗乡二百七十五户人家，解放前只有一百四十一把锄头，现在有了七百二十把；解放前只有二百九十七件布衣服、一床棉被，到现在有了一千七百八十九件布衣服和一百八十七床棉被。群众说：“现在吃干饭，一天吃的抵得过去三天粮”。从前看见穿布衣服的人就躲，现在人人都穿上了。过去怒江人病了就杀牲祭鬼，要吃药也没处找，现在有了三十一个卫生机构，一个只有十二万人口的地区，一九五六年一年就诊治了三十三万多人次；现在我们有了自己的新文字，已经在青壮年中推广，原来只有强派学生、学款学粮的十九所小学，现在成立了一百零二所，教育着学生七千四百八十三人，还开办了从来做梦也没有想到过的第一所民族中学！
    右派分子睁着眼睛不愿看这些成绩，竖着耳朵不愿听这些变化，反而把这些成绩、变化当作“一团糟”，所以龙云才公然提出“自治以后的发展，我看共产党也没有办法”。要正告龙云：共产党的办法最多也最好，没有发展办法而有摧残办法的，倒是国民党龙云！解放以来，我们变聪明了，狼和羊能分得开，蜂蜜和毒药也辨得清。
    全州各族农民认定了合作化是幸福之路
    一九五六年后，我们根据自己地区的社会特点，采取了直接过渡的办法，不经过土地改革就进行社会主义改造。我们非常高兴：试建的一百四十六个合作社都成功了。第一批试办的六十七个社中，增产八成以上的有十二个，其他都有不同程度的增产，百分之八十三的社员都增加了收入。泸水鲁初罗社三十四户，一九五五年大春粮食收入九十五石、副业收入二百九十元，办社后头一年，大春就收到二百零五点二石，副业收入八百六十四元，粮食增产一倍多，副业增加将近二倍，现在边四县入社农民已达总农户百分之十二点五，加入互助组的达百分之六十。我敢断言：全州各族农民已经看清了合作社的优越性，已经认定了合作化是幸福的方向。右派分子企图在我们中间散布消极情绪，拿什么“内地退社的多呀”，“未必适合边疆地区”，“走快了没有”等等谰言吓唬我们，只会引起我们的无比愤恨，绝对动摇不了我们的意志。
    当然，在我们前进中还会遇到困难。工作中也还有些缺点，例如干部中还残存着地方民族主义及大民族主义思想；试办合作社中，研究民族及地区的特点不够，各项工作的配合还有缺陷等等。但是要告诉右派分子：这是我们人民内部的事，我们曾经不断克服，今后更将依据主席的指示，不断在工作中和整风中克服，你们休想来钻空子破坏！抓住白毡子里的一根黑羊毛，一定要叫我们把白毡子说成黑毡子是做不到的。一棵枯草堵不了滔滔江水，没有任何力量可以拦堵我们的去路！
    各位代表：让我们紧紧地团结在共产党和毛主席的周围，不许右派分子乱说乱动，不许右派分子在少数民族中间捣鬼。我保证：我们愿在党的领导下，在国家各级政府的扶持下，在先进民族的帮助下，与全国各族人民一道，沿着社会主义的道路，毫不动摇的前进！
