Any force cannot separate China's youth from the Communist Party and Socialism.
Luo Yi's speech

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the work reports of Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. These reports vividly illustrate the great achievements of our country's various constructions, provide a completely correct assessment of the country's various tasks, powerfully criticize various erroneous ideas, and clearly point out the direction for future progress. Undoubtedly, these reports have given China's youth another profound Marxist education, equipping them with powerful ideological weapons in the current fierce struggle to counter the bourgeois right-wing elements.

The Broad Masses of Youth Have Learned to Identify Demons and Monsters and Are Launching a Counterattack with the Force of a Thousand Armies
The past few months have been extremely extraordinary in our country's political life. Our great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, delivered the speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." This speech provided a profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the current situation in our country, gave us sharp weapons for understanding and dealing with various issues in socialist construction, and greatly enhanced people's confidence in the great socialist cause under the leadership of our wise Party. The Party Central Committee's call to launch a rectification movement throughout the Party further aroused the determination of the broad masses of cadres and the people to overcome shortcomings and strengthen unity. However, the right-wing elements, blinded by greed, misjudged the situation and miscalculated. They mistakenly believed that the prestige of the Communist Party had collapsed, that the people would follow them, and that the time had come for them to seize leadership. Therefore, under the guise of "helping the Party with rectification," they launched a large-scale attack on the Party and the socialist cause, attempting to create a capitalist restoration. The people of our country promptly exposed the reactionary schemes of the right-wing elements. Thus, in the eyes of the right-wing elements, the situation that had been very favorable to them just over a month ago suddenly changed. They discovered that the people had not followed them, but instead they were surrounded by the people. A small group of right-wing elements were like "rats crossing the street," with everyone shouting to beat them. This is a great victory for the people of our country in consolidating the socialist cause! This is a great victory because it has made it clear to the people of the whole country that there are still demons and monsters in our society, a group of people who are kind on the surface but evil at heart, ready to seize opportunities and create restorationist reactionary politicians, hooligans, and schemers! If these demons and monsters are not exposed, they will cause endless trouble for our socialist cause. But all demons can only operate in the dark. When they are dragged into the sunlight and people see their true faces, all their charming sorcery is over. This is a great victory, also because the broad masses of the people, especially our youth, have learned how to identify demons and monsters and how to expose various heresies and evil arts, thereby greatly enhancing their awareness. This is a major victory for proletarian ideology. If we say that in the past few years, our socialist revolution has already solved the basic issue of the ownership of the means of production, but the question of "who defeats whom" in the ideological and political fields has not yet been resolved, then this anti-rightist struggle will greatly contribute to the resolution of the latter question. This is of extreme importance for the final victory of our socialism. China's youth know that defending socialism is defending the happiness and future of the youth. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of youth are launching a powerful counterattack against the right-wing elements with the force of a thousand armies.

Anyone Who Attempts to Split the Youth from the Party is Bound to Suffer a Shameful Defeat
To carry out their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, the right-wing elements need to find masses who can wave flags and shout for them. Therefore, they attempted to find supporters and adherents among the young intellectuals who lack social and political experience. They saw that many university students were responding to the Party's rectification movement and making many criticisms and suggestions about the work, and they thought this was an opportunity to be exploited. So they acted wantonly everywhere, spreading poison and lighting fires everywhere. They even became carried away and said: Now students are looking for leaders everywhere, expecting them to come out and speak. They said that at the beginning of liberation, students wanted to settle down and study because they had made too much trouble before liberation, and the workload was heavy, and the Party's prestige was high, so it was calm for a few years. Now the situation is different, the Party is seriously divorced from the masses, coupled with the impact of the Polish and Hungarian events, the situation is on the verge of exploding. What utter nonsense! Why did the students "make so much trouble" before liberation? Because the broad masses of students and people were subjected to the heavy oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. They demanded the establishment of an independent, democratic, and free new China. Why was it "calm" after liberation? Because the ideal of establishing a new China had been realized, and students naturally wanted to settle down and study in order to learn the skills to build a new China. This is a well-known truth, but they simply refuse to see it that way. They thought that if students followed the Communist Party to overthrow the reactionary regime before liberation, today students would also follow them, this group of right-wing elements, to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party. What are the facts? Even in May and June, when they thought the situation was very favorable to them, only a very small number of dregs like Lin Xiling and Tan Tianrong faithfully followed this group of right-wing leaders. Some students were deceived, but the vast majority of students still stood on the side of the Party. We Chinese youth have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Since the "May Fourth Movement," the Chinese youth movement has always been under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party. Anyone who attempts to split China's youth from our Party is bound to suffer a shameful defeat.

Without the Party, There Can Be No Revolutionary Spirit; The Right-Wing Elements Want to Pull the Youth Backwards
The right-wing elements also know that in our country today, anyone who openly raises the banner of anti-Party and anti-socialism and openly peddles the fallacy of capitalist restoration will have no market. The right-wing elements always coat their poison with bright and attractive colors. They attempt to use the so-called "May Fourth Spirit" to lure students. But we know that at the time of the "May Fourth Movement," there were two kinds of spirit, one was the spirit of surrender represented by the bourgeois right-wing elements, which was to turn the clock back; the other was the revolutionary spirit represented by intellectuals with communist ideas, which was to push the times forward. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there can be no talk of the "May Fourth" revolutionary spirit. The right-wing elements always dress themselves up as the most "revolutionary," seemingly even more "revolutionary" than the Communist Party and the working class. They talk about "thorough democracy and freedom," "genuine socialism," and so on. But we know that in the current stage of human social development, there are only two systems to choose from, either the decadent capitalist system or the progressive socialist system. Today, for the vast majority of the people, is there any system more free, more democratic, and more wonderful than socialism? Anyone who opposes our socialist system today, no matter how beautifully he speaks, still belongs to the capitalist camp, outwardly "left" but actually right. We also know that there are various parties in the world that fly the banner of socialism, but only in countries led by the Communist Party can a socialist system be truly established, and humanity can truly begin its spring. Precisely because young people are full of ideals and eagerly pursue a bright future, they must steadfastly be loyal to the Party and loyal to the socialist system. We will never let the right-wing elements, under the guise of beautiful words, pull us backwards.

The Socialist System Gives Young People a Great Future; The Right-Wing's Capitalist Goods Cannot Confuse People
The right-wing elements also pretend to be the most caring and concerned about the youth. They say that "socialism restricts the development of the youth's personality" and that "studying Marxism-Leninism will hinder the youth's independent thinking." Under the guise of "bold exploration," "pursuit of truth," and "independent thinking," they spread skepticism and nihilism to the youth, peddle bourgeois liberalism, encourage young people to blindly pursue personal development, and attempt to lead the youth away from the leadership of the Party, to doubt everything, to be dissatisfied with everything, and to deny everything. But China's youth know who led us to rescue the motherland from a troubled situation, who led us to make such great progress in our country's industry, agriculture, culture, and education in just a few years, and who led the people of our country to be able to hold their heads high and truly stand before the people of the world. Who has truly enabled the people of our country to be the masters of their own affairs and control their own destiny, and who has brought such a happy life and an infinitely bright future to the youth of our country today. It is none other than the Communist Party, which is hated by the right-wing elements, and the Marxism-Leninism, which is opposed by them. We young people deeply understand from our own personal experience that the truth is Marxism-Leninism. Our Party is the standard-bearer armed with Marxism-Leninism that leads the people of our country to advance victoriously. The so-called independent thinking and bold exploration is to bravely solve the new problems that constantly arise in socialist construction under the guidance of the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method. Only by learning and mastering Marxism-Leninism can our minds be truly liberated, and can our personal wisdom and talents be infinitely developed. Under our socialist system, every young person who is loyal to serving the people under the leadership of the Communist Party has a great future. We will never let the right-wing elements confuse our eyes with some capitalist goods and lead us astray.

Firmly Establish a Proletarian Stand and Carry the Struggle Against the Right-Wing to the End
The right-wing elements' conspiracy to deceive the youth and seize the youth has failed. China's youth have received a profound education in this storm. Today, in our country, the flames of class struggle have not been extinguished, and the ideas and habits of the bourgeoisie still have a great influence on the youth. Why do different people often have different views on the same thing? This is obviously due to different positions and viewpoints. Therefore, for the youth of our country, the most important thing is to firmly establish a proletarian stand, learn to use the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" to identify whether people's words and actions are correct, to distinguish between "fragrant flowers" or "poisonous weeds," and thus to determine what we should approve of or oppose. For young intellectuals, it is also necessary to constantly learn humbly from the workers and peasants and to be firmly linked with the workers and peasants.

Now the struggle against the right-wing elements is far from over. Many right-wing elements are still stubbornly resisting. We must attack fiercely and pursue fiercely, and we must not have any tenderness. We must not tolerate evil for the black sheep among the youth, but we must resolutely struggle against them. Their only way out is to thoroughly repent and start anew.

Flowers cultivated in a greenhouse cannot withstand the wind and frost, and true warriors can only grow in battle. After this great storm of class struggle, China's younger generation has been tempered more strongly than before. We must firmly hold the banner of socialism in our own hands, and under the leadership of our great Party, advance from victory to victory!

    任何力量都不能使我国青年同共产党和社会主义分离开
    罗毅的发言
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长的各项工作报告。这些报告生动地说明了我国各项建设的伟大成就，对国家各项工作作了完全正确的估价，有力地批判了各种错误思想，明确地指出了今后前进的方向。无疑地，这些报告使我国青年又受到了一次深刻的马克思主义的教育，使青年在目前反击资产阶级右派分子的猛烈斗争中，获得了有力的思想武器。
    广大青年学会识别妖魔鬼怪  正以千军万马之势展开反击
    过去的几个月，是我国政治生活上极不平凡的几个月。我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志，发表了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演。这篇讲演，对我国当前形势作了深刻的马克思列宁主义的分析，给了我们认识和处理社会主义建设中各项问题的锐利武器，大大地增强了人们对我们英明的党领导下的伟大的社会主义事业的信心。党中央关于在全党开展整风运动的号召，更激起了广大干部和群众对克服缺点、加强团结的决心。可是利令智昏的右派分子，却错看了形势，错打了算盘。他们误认为共产党的威信垮台了，人民群众会跟着他们跑了，他们篡夺领导的时机来到了。于是，他们打着“帮助党整风”的幌子，对党、对社会主义事业大举进攻，妄想造成资本主义的复辟。我国人民及时揭发了右派分子的反动阴谋。于是在右派分子看来，仅仅一个多月前对他们还十分有利的形势，突然起了变化，他们发现人民群众并没有跟他们走，倒是他们受到了人民群众的包围，一小撮右派分子就像“老鼠过街”那样，人人都在喊打。这是我国人民巩固社会主义事业斗争中的一个伟大胜利！这是一个伟大的胜利，因为它使全国人民都清楚地看到，在我们社会里，还存在着一批妖魔鬼怪，一批面善心恶，随时准备待机而起制造复辟的反动政客、流氓和阴谋家！这些牛鬼蛇神如果不揭发出来，就会对我们社会主义事业造成无穷的后患。但是一切妖魔总是只在黑暗里才能进行活动，当他们被拉到太阳底下，人们看穿了他们的真实面目后，他们一切迷人的邪术也就完蛋了。这是一个伟大的胜利，还在于广大人民，特别是我们青年，从中学会了如何去识别妖魔鬼怪，如何去揭穿各种妖道邪术，从而大大地提高了自己的觉悟。这是无产阶级思想的一个重大胜利。如果说，过去几年中，我们社会主义革命是已经解决了生产资料所有制这个基本问题，而在意识形态、政治思想领域内的“谁战胜谁”的问题尚未解决的话，那么这一次反右派斗争，就将大大有利于后一个问题的解决。这对我们社会主义的最后胜利有极重大的意义。我国青年知道，保卫社会主义，就是保卫青年的幸福和未来。现在广大青年，正在党的领导下以千军万马之势，对右派分子展开强大的反击。
    谁妄想把青年跟党分裂开来  谁就一定遭到可耻的失败
    右派分子要进行反党、反社会主义的勾当，他们就需要找能够为他们摇旗呐喊的群众。于是他们就企图从缺乏社会政治经验的知识青年中，找到他们的附和者和支持者。他们看到许多高等学校学生，响应党的整风运动，对工作提出了许多批评建议，就认为这是可乘之机，于是到处大肆活动，到处放毒、点火。他们甚至得意忘形地说：现在学生到处在找领袖，在期望他们这班人出来讲话。说什么，解放之初，学生因为解放前闹的太多，想安下心来学习，那时功课也重，党的威信也高，所以平静了几年。现在情况不同了，党严重地脱离了群众，加以波匈事件的影响，形势就一触即发。真是发昏第十三章！解放前学生为什么“闹得多”呢？因为广大学生和人民，受到帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的重重压迫，他们要求建立一个独立、民主、自由的新中国。解放之后为什么“平静”了呢？因为建立新中国的理想已经实现了，学生当然要安下心来学习，以便学会本领建设新中国。这是人所皆知的道理，但是他们却偏偏不这样看。他们以为，解放以前学生会跟着共产党推翻反动政权，今天学生也会跟着他们这批右派分子来推翻共产党的领导。事实怎样呢？即使在他们认为形势对他们大为有利的五、六月里，忠实地跟着这批右派头子跑的也只不过是极少数像林希翎、谭天荣这样的败类。有一部分学生曾被蒙蔽，而极大多数学生却仍然是站在党的一边。我们中国青年有着光荣的革命传统，从“五四运动”以来，中国青年运动一直就是在伟大的中国共产党领导之下的。谁妄想把我国青年跟我们党分裂开来，谁就一定会遭到可耻的失败。
    离开党就谈不上什么革命精神  右派分子是想拉青年去开倒车
    右派分子也知道，在我们国家里，今天谁如果公开打起反党、反社会主义的旗帜，公开贩卖资本主义复辟的谬论，是没有什么市场的。右派分子总是把他们的毒药涂上鲜艳诱人的颜色。他们妄想用什么“五四精神”来诱骗学生。但是我们知道，在“五四运动”的时候，就有两种精神，一种是资产阶级右派分子所代表的投降精神，这就是想让时代开倒车；另一种则是具有共产主义思想的知识分子所代表的革命精神，把时代推向前进。离开了共产党的领导，就谈不到什么“五四”革命精神。右派分子又总是把自己打扮得是最“革命”的，似乎是比共产党和工人阶级还要更“革命”一些。他们说什么要“彻底的民主自由”，要“真正的社会主义”等等。但是我们知道，在人类社会发展的现阶段，只可能选择两种制度，要末是腐朽的资本主义制度，要末是进步的社会主义制度。在今天，对于最大多数的人民来说，难道还有什么比社会主义更自由、更民主、更美妙的制度么？谁要反对我们今天的社会主义制度，不管他说得多么漂亮，还是属于资本主义这一窝，貌“左”而实右。我们还知道，世界上还有各种各样打着社会主义招牌的政党，但是只有在共产党领导的国家中，才能真正地建立社会主义制度，人类才真正开始了自己的春天。正因为青年们富于理想，热烈追求美好的未来，青年们就要坚定不移地忠实于党、忠实于社会主义制度。我们决不让右派分子在美丽词句的伪装下，把我们拉去开倒车。
    社会主义制度使青年有远大前途  右派的资本主义货色迷糊不了人
    右派分子还装出最爱护青年、关怀青年的样子。说什么“社会主义束缚了青年的个性发展”，“学习马列主义会妨碍青年的独立思考”。他们在“大胆探索”、“追求真理”、“独立思考”的词句下，向青年散布怀疑主义和虚无主义，贩卖资产阶级自由主义的私货，鼓励青年盲目追求个人的发展，企图引导青年脱离党的领导，怀疑一切，不满一切，否定一切。但是我国青年知道，是谁领导我们把祖国从多灾多难的境遇中解救出来，是谁领导着我们在短短的几年中使我国的工业、农业、文化教育获得如此巨大的发展，是谁领导我国人民能够扬眉吐气在世界人民面前真正站立起来。是谁使我国人民真正做到了当家做主，自己掌握了自己的命运，是谁为我国青年带来了今天这样幸福的生活和展示了无限美好的未来。这不是别的，正是被右派分子所痛恨的共产党，和为他们所反对的马克思列宁主义。我们青年从自己切身的体会中深刻地懂得，真理，这就是马克思列宁主义。我们的党，就是用马列主义武装起来的领导我国人民胜利前进的旗手。所谓独立思考、大胆探索，这就是要在马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法的指导下，勇敢地去解决在社会主义建设中不断出现的新的问题。只有学习和掌握了马列主义，才能使我们的思想得到真正的解放，才能无限地发展个人的智慧和才能。在我们社会主义制度下，在共产党领导下的每一个忠诚为人民服务的青年，都有远大的前途。我们决不让右派分子用资本主义的一些货色来迷糊自己的眼睛，走入歧途。
    巩固地确立起无产阶级立场  把反击右派的斗争进行到底
    右派分子欺骗青年、夺取青年的阴谋已经破产了。我国青年在这场风浪中受到了深刻的教育。今天，在我国，阶级斗争的火焰并没有熄灭，资产阶级的思想和习惯对青年还发生着很大的影响。为什么同样一件事情，不同的人却常常有各种不同的看法呢？这显然是由于立场和观点不相同的缘故。因此对我国青年来说，最重要的事情就是要巩固地确立起无产阶级立场，学会按照毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中所提出的六项政治标准，去鉴别人们的言论、行动是否正确，辨别什么是“香花”或“毒草”，并从而去确定什么是我们应该赞成的或反对的。对于青年知识分子来说，还必须经常虚心地向工农学习，牢固地和工农连结在一起。
    现在反击右派的斗争还远没有结束，不少右派分子还在继续顽抗，我们一定要狠狠地攻，狠狠地追，决不能有一点温情。对于青年中的害群之马也不能姑息养奸，而要坚决斗争。他们的唯一出路，就是彻底悔改自新。
    温室里培养的花朵经不起风霜，真正的战士只有在战斗中才能成长。经过这次阶级斗争的大风浪，我国的年轻一代是比以前锻炼得更坚强了。我们一定要把社会主义的大旗紧握在自己的手里，在我们伟大的党的领导下，从胜利走向胜利！
