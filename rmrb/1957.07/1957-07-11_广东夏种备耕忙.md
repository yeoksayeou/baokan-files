Guangdong's Summer Planting Preparations in Full Swing

(Our dispatch) Rural areas throughout Guangdong province are busily engaged in summer planting preparations. In the Chaoshan Plain, the Pearl River Delta, and the West River areas, late rice sowing has already concluded. In Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula, where the season begins earlier, rice transplanting has begun successively. Currently, rice seedlings are generally growing lush and strong, and farmers are strengthening paddy field management.

Farmers in Shantou, Gaoyao, and other regions are working from dawn till dusk to accumulate fertilizer and drain and irrigate the paddy fields. In Chao'an, Puning, Raoping, and three other counties, after rectifying the cooperatives and studying documents on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, more than 440 cooperatives have established veteran farmer advisory offices and convened meetings of production team leaders and farmer technicians to study technical measures such as seed selection, seed soaking, and sparse sowing. Consequently, the degree of blind production in various counties has been greatly reduced. Currently, the province has accumulated more than 280 million dan of fertilizer, generally of good quality.

However, at present, a small number of agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas are not sufficiently motivated, and the masses lack confidence in increasing production. These situations have attracted the attention of the leadership, and cadres have been dispatched to villages to assist agricultural cooperatives in planning labor and repairing and supplementing farm implements and plowing cattle. In Xinxing County, 438 out of 500 cooperatives have repaired plows and harrows and have designated special personnel to manage paddy fields, implementing an inspection and supervision system. To support farmers in summer planting, the provincial supply and marketing cooperative has also promptly allocated 14 tons of chemical fertilizer to meet production needs.

    广东夏种备耕忙
    本报讯　广东省各地农村正在繁忙地进行夏种备耕活动。潮汕平原、珠江三角洲和西江等地区，晚稻播种已经结束，季节较早的海南岛和雷州半岛已经陆续插秧，现在各地秧苗一般生长青绿壮旺，农民正在加强秧田管理。
    汕头、高要等专区的农民，起早贪黑的进行积肥和秧田的排水灌水工作；潮安、普宁、饶平等六县通过整社，学习关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的文件以后，有四百四十多个社成立了老农顾问处，并召开生产队长、农民技术员会议，研究选种、浸种和疏播等技术措施，因而各县在生产中的盲目性大大减少。现在全省积肥已经达到二亿八千多万担，质量一般良好。
    但是，目前尚有少数灾区农业社的劲头不太足，群众对增产信心不高。这些情况已经引起领导部门的重视，并派出干部到村里帮助农业社做好劳动力规划和农具、耕牛的修理补充工作。新兴县五百个社中，有四百三十八个社修补好犁耙，并且指定专人管理秧田，实现检查督促制度。省供销合作社为了支援农民夏种，也及时调拨了十四吨化学肥料，供应生产需要。
