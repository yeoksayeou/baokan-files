Xinhua News Agency, July 27th, London: The London Disarmament Conference continued on July 25th and 26th. Western nations’ representatives at the conference continued to avoid discussing the immediate prevention of nuclear testing and substantial troop reductions.

On July 25th, U.S. representative Stassen suggested that within three months after a "partial disarmament agreement" came into effect, both sides, East and West, should establish a technical committee to study the "supervision of missiles." In his speech, Stassen did not discuss matters of principle regarding disarmament, focusing instead on minor details of "supervision."

Stassen has not yet presented the full U.S. proposal. Western news agency reports said that Zorin asked Stassen at the July 26th meeting when the U.S. suggestions would be fully presented. Stassen was unwilling to commit to a specific date.

Since returning to London on May 28th, Stassen spent nearly four weeks preparing the U.S. proposal and then another four weeks presenting it. He has said he will need another four or five weeks to complete his presentation.

Xinhua News Agency, London, July 26th: The British Peace Committee issued a statement on July 25th calling for continued disarmament negotiations. The statement said: "A recess now would dash the hopes of millions of people throughout the world."

The London Disarmament Subcommittee is scheduled to report to the United Nations Disarmament Commission on August 1st. The Western nations, which have repeatedly obstructed negotiations, either intend to continue playing delaying tactics or hope for a recess. On the same morning, six women leaders submitted a letter to the Disarmament Subcommittee, which said: "Complete disarmament is very complex, but we believe it is possible in the next few days to reach an agreement on hydrogen bomb testing as a separate but important step."

    西方国家代表回避当前重要问题
    伦敦裁军会议停滞不前
    史塔生说美国方案还要一个多月才提完
    新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：伦敦裁军会议7月25日和26日继续举行。西方国家代表在会议上继续避免谈论立即防止核试验问题和大量裁减军队问题。
    美国代表史塔生7月25日建议：在“局部裁军协议”生效后三个月以内由东西双方成立一个技术委员会，研究“监督导弹”问题。史塔生在发言中除了谈到“监督”方面的枝节问题外，没有谈到裁军的原则性问题。
    史塔生还没有提出美国方案的全部。西方通讯社消息说，佐林在7月26日会议上问史塔生：什么时候才能把美国的建议提完。史塔生不愿说定什么时候。
    自从史塔生5月28日回到伦敦以来，他用了近四个星期的时间酝酿提出美国的方案，又用了随后的四个星期来提出美国的方案。他曾经说过：他要再用四、五个星期来提完他的方案。
    新华社伦敦26日电　英国和平委员会7月25日发表声明，要求继续进行裁军谈判。声明说：“在现在休会将使全世界千百万人的希望破灭。”
    伦敦裁军小组委员会应该在8月1日向联合国裁军委员会汇报工作。在谈判中屡施阻挠的西方国家不是想继续玩弄拖延手段，就是希望休会。同一天上午，有六位妇女领袖把一封信交给了裁军小组委员会，这封信说：“全面裁军是很复杂的，但是我们认为，在今后几天内就氢弹试验问题达成协议，作为一个单独的、然而是重要的步骤，这是可能的。”
