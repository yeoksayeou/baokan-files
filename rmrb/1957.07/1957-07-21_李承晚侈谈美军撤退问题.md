Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th: Seoul dispatch: Syngman Rhee told a group of American reporters in Seoul today that if the "Chinese Communists" withdrew from North Korea, he would demand that American troops withdraw from South Korea.

At the same time, Syngman Rhee arrogantly expressed that he "disdained to attach importance" to the proposal by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a political conference. He also said that South Korea would participate in an international conference convened to discuss the reunification of Korea. He said, however, that no one had asked him to attend any such conference.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly proposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the entire Korean peninsula and has requested the speedy convening of an international conference with the broad participation of relevant countries to promote the realization of this proposal and to achieve the peaceful unification of Korea. However, these proposals have been unreasonably rejected by the United States and Syngman Rhee.

Syngman Rhee also stated yesterday that he firmly opposed reducing his troops and the so-called "first-line defense forces" of the United States in South Korea. Today, he suddenly stated that if the Chinese People's Volunteers agreed to withdraw from northern Korea and promised not to return, he would "approve of the withdrawal of foreign troops." His purpose is not only to cover up the long-term occupation of South Korea by American troops, but also to dream of realizing his constantly clamoring "northward advance" and the conspiracy to unify Korea by force. Today, he openly and arrogantly said that in the event of the withdrawal of foreign troops, "North Korea is a very small factor." He said: "I have always told my friends (Americans) that peaceful reunification of Korea is impossible. If you are unwilling to fight the communists, then let us do it."

    李承晚侈谈美军撤退问题
    据新华社平壤19日电　汉城消息：李承晚今天在汉城向一批美国记者说，要是“中国共产党人”撤出北朝鲜的话，他将要求美国军队撤出南朝鲜。
    李承晚同时狂妄地表示“不屑重视”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国提出的召开政治会议的建议。他又说，南朝鲜将参加为了讨论朝鲜的重新统一问题而召开的国际会议。他说，但是，还没有人要求过他参加任何这样的会议。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国曾经多次提出从全朝鲜地区撤出一切外国军队的主张，并且要求迅速召开有关国家广泛参加的国际会议，来促进这一主张的实现和达成朝鲜的和平统一。但是，这些主张，一直遭到美国和李承晚的无理拒绝。
    李承晚在昨天还表示坚决反对削减他的军队和美国在南朝鲜的所谓“第一线防御力量”，今天突然表示，如果中国人民志愿军同意撤出朝鲜北部并且答应不再回来，他就“赞成外国军队撤退”，其目的不但是为美军长期占据南朝鲜打掩护，并且还梦想实现他所不断叫嚣的“北进”和武力统一朝鲜的阴谋。他今天公然狂妄地说：在外国军队撤退的情况下，“北朝鲜是个很微小的因素。”他说：“我一直对我的朋友们（美国人）说，和平统一朝鲜是办不到的。如果你们不愿意打共产党，那就让我们来干吧。”
