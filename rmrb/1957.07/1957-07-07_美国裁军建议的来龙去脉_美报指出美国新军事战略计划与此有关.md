Xinhua News Agency, New York, 6th: American newspapers report that behind the disarmament and related nuclear test proposals currently put forward by the United States in the London disarmament talks lies a red line, namely the new US military strategic plan.

In American political circles, some people believe that under the guarantee that the US's new military strategic plan can be implemented, it may be worthwhile to reach a "preliminary disarmament agreement" with the Soviet Union, so as to change the embarrassing position of the US being criticized by world public opinion.

At the same time, there is still a considerable powerful force in American military and political circles that opposes reaching any disarmament agreement. What these people are actually worried about is that even a "preliminary disarmament agreement" may risk opening the floodgates to the torrent of peace.

Within the American ruling group, this debate over whether or not to prepare to reach an agreement is still continuing. It seems that the current US authorities' policy towards the London disarmament talks is, on the one hand, to put forward its disarmament proposals to cope with public opinion. On the other hand, its proposals are also mixed with many problems and conditions, so as to use these to continue entanglement and delay time in the negotiations.

The US government put forward the so-called "New New Look" plan after the Hungarian incident and the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt last year. This new plan is based on nuclear weapons, and the army will be "changed into a smaller but more specialized force."

In promoting the "New New Look" plan, heavy financial pressure has been encountered. Huge military expenditures have already created the threat of inflation in the United States, and have therefore aroused demands for "economy" and tax reduction. Defense Secretary Wilson recently said at a conference discussing various "defense" issues that if the US armed forces are to remain within the 38 billion US dollar "defense" budget, military manpower would have to be reduced. From these backgrounds, it is not difficult to understand the US disarmament proposals.

The United States has also proposed that it can suspend nuclear weapons testing for ten months, but at the same time, an agreement should be reached to stop the production of fissile materials for military purposes. The reason for this, it is revealed, is that the US's reserves of explosives used to make hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs are currently excessive. As for why the suspension of testing is for ten months, according to the American "Daily News," this proposal "has very little risk, because it will probably take the United States about ten months to plan the next batch of tests."

    美国裁军建议的来龙去脉
    美报指出美国新军事战略计划与此有关
    据新华社6日讯　纽约消息：美国报刊报道，美国目前在伦敦裁军谈判中所提出的裁军和有关核试验的建议后面有着一根红线，那就是美国的新军事战略计划。
    在美国政界里，有一些人认为，在保证能够贯彻美国的新军事战略计划下，不妨同苏联达成“初步裁军协议”，这样可以改变美国目前受世界舆论指责的难堪地位。
    同时，在美国军界和政界里还有相当强大的势力，反对达成任何裁军协议。这些人实际上担心的是，即使是“初步裁军协议”，也可能要冒给和平洪流开闸的危险。
    在美国统治集团里，这场准备不准备达成协议的争论还在继续着。看来，美国当局目前对伦敦裁军会谈的方针是，一方面提出它的裁军建议来应付舆论。另一方面，在它的建议里又夹带着许多问题和条件，以利用这些来在谈判中继续纠缠，拖延时间。
    美国政府在去年匈牙利事件和英法以色列侵略埃及以后提出了所谓“新新面貌”计划。这个新计划是以核武器为基础，陆军将“被改为规模更小，但更加专门化的军队”。
    在推行“新新面貌”计划中，遇到了沉重的财政压力。庞大的军事开支在美国国内已经造成通货膨胀的威胁，并且因此而引起了“节约”和减低捐税的要求。国防部长威尔逊最近在一次讨论各种“防务”问题的会议上说，如果美国的武装部队要留在三百八十亿美元的“防务”预算之内，军事人力就不得不减少。从这些背景就不难理解美国的裁军建议。
    美国还提出可以暂停核武器试验十个月，但同时要协议停止生产用于军事目的的分裂物质。其中原因，据透露是，美国用来制造氢弹和原子弹的爆炸物储蓄量目前已经多得过剩了。至于为什么是暂停试验十个月，据美国“每日新闻”说，这个建议“危险性很少，因为美国要筹划下一批试验大概也需要十个月”。
