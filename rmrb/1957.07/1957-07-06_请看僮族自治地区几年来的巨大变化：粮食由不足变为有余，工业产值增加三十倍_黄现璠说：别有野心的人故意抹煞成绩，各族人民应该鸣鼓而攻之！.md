    Please look at the great changes in the Zhuang Autonomous Region over the past few years:
    Grain has changed from insufficient to surplus, and industrial output value has increased thirtyfold.
    Huang Xianfan says: Those with ulterior motives deliberately obliterate achievements, and people of all ethnic groups should attack them collectively!
    I fully agree with the various reports of the government leaders. If the congress passes the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, as a representative of the Zhuang people, I will support it even more and express my heartfelt gratitude!
    Since the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 1952, which was changed to a prefecture last year, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government and their continuous care and attention, great achievements have been made in the past few years. Before liberation, the entire prefecture was always unable to be self-sufficient in grain. In 1956, 98.8 percent of farmers in the prefecture participated in agricultural cooperatives, resulting in increased production. In 1956, grain reached more than 5.6 billion jin, an increase of about 30 percent compared with the highest annual output before liberation. It is not only sufficient for self-sufficiency but also has surplus grain to support national socialist construction. The development of factories and mining enterprises is also rapid. Before liberation, there were only a few. After liberation, by the end of 1956, there were 478, more than three times the number in the early days of liberation. In 1956, the total industrial output value of the prefecture reached 125.554 million yuan, an increase of 30 times compared with the early days of liberation. Other undertakings such as transportation, culture, education, and health have also made considerable achievements, thus improving people's lives significantly. The purchasing power of the people in the prefecture, calculated in RMB, was 19.92 million yuan in 1953 and 95 million yuan in 1954, an increase of 476 percent over the previous year. There was even more increase after 1954. What has happened in Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture is the same as that in other parts of the country. Who can deny that our country's construction in recent years, thanks to the leadership of the Party, has achieved mainly significant progress? The rightists, with ulterior motives, deliberately obliterate achievements, exaggerate shortcomings, and vainly attempt to abolish the leadership of the Party, which is wrong and reactionary. The people of all ethnic groups across the country should "attack them collectively."
    Now I would like to offer some opinions on the development of production undertakings and cultural education in Guixi and Guangxi.
    Guangxi has an area of more than 218,000 square kilometers. The residential areas of Zhuang, Miao, Yao, Dong, and other ethnic minorities account for 70 percent, and the Han nationality accounts for 30 percent (see the illustrations in my book "A Brief History of the Zhuang Nationality in Guangxi," which was distributed at the conference). A characteristic of ethnic minority residential areas is that there are more mountains, the soil quality is poor, the productivity is low, and life is difficult. In the Bama Donglan area of the Youjiang revolutionary base, there is a popular folk song: "The West Mountain is as high as the sky, living on porridge all year round. If you want to eat your fill and dress warmly, unless the stone mountain turns into money." The Zhuang people live in such a geographical environment, and they need to work particularly hard and develop various production undertakings in order to overcome difficulties and solve their lives.
    However, this geographical environment, while having its disadvantages, also has its advantages. It has a particularly large number of special local products, about 500 kinds, of which about 170 kinds have a large output, which is a good natural condition for engaging in sideline occupations. However, for many varieties, such as asparagus cochinchinensis pollen, ligusticum chuanxiong, and fleeceflower root, although the government has already purchased them, the prices are quite low. In the Longlin area, a person cannot earn even three jiao a day for their labor. Radix Adenophorae, ox seven, mountain seven, Imperata cylindrica and the like are generally considered valuable, but the government has not yet purchased them and has no listed prices. I recently went to the Baise area for inspection, and in many areas, the national trade bureaus have not effectively implemented the national trade policy of "no profit and no loss, profit and loss, and using profit to compensate for losses." Special local products have not received due attention, and it is impossible to stimulate and encourage farmers' production, let alone development. I hope that in terms of national trade, reasonable prices should be given to special local products, and prices should be appropriately increased, as well as appropriate and maximum possible purchases.
    The Guixi Zhuang area is particularly rich in mineral resources. According to several years of exploration, non-ferrous metals, ferrous metals, rare metals, and non-metallic minerals are widely distributed. Most of the lead, zinc, and other mineral deposits in Guangxi Province are in the Zhuang and other ethnic minority areas. Recently, eight new minerals have been discovered in the province, and 52 of the 70 mineral areas are in the Zhuang area. Their reserves are also very rich. For example, coal reserves account for 92 percent of the province's reserves, and manganese reserves account for 90 percent of the province's reserves. Therefore, in this area, the government should gradually develop industrial and mining enterprises. At the same time, Guixi has a vast area and a sparse population, with an average population density of just over 50 people per square kilometer. There is a considerable amount of usable land, which provides good geographical conditions for developing cash crops, special local products, animal husbandry, and forestry. For example, Baise, Longlin, and other counties have many vast natural pastures with abundant water and grass, which can be used with less money and more benefits. If the government pays attention and invests in gradually developing and utilizing these open spaces and various mineral resources, it will not only improve the economic conditions of the Zhuang and other ethnic minority areas, but also be beneficial to the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Furthermore, Guangxi's cultural and educational undertakings have made considerable achievements in recent years thanks to the leadership of the Party; in particular, the successful creation of the Zhuang script is a great happy event for the Zhuang people. However, in general, the development of culture and education in Guangxi is still very slow. Therefore, I hope that Guangxi University can be re-established soon. In 1955, when the national unified enrollment was held, Guangxi candidates did not perform well and were admitted very few, and even fewer Zhuang children from the Zuoyoujiang and Hongshuihe regions were admitted. The reasons are not only one, but the poor quality of middle school teachers is very related. In the past few years, I have often gone to the above-mentioned places for inspection. Generally, less than 40% of the teachers in various middle schools have graduated or studied at universities and colleges, and most of them are high school graduates. A teacher from Chongzuo Middle School said to me: "I graduated from the old-style middle school, and I didn't learn a certain course at first. Because no one was in charge, I had to teach it. I prepare lessons very hard, but the results are still not great." Moreover, in order to develop various industrial and mining and other production undertakings in Guangxi, it is necessary to have various construction technical talents, and these talents are currently very lacking in Guangxi and need to be cultivated urgently. In the past, some areas did not have universities. Recently, in order to cultivate construction talents, they have been established one after another. Guangxi University should also be restored as soon as possible. However, according to relevant information: "The Ministry of Higher Education has not considered the restoration of Guangxi University in the second five-year plan." Such a delay is not the wish of the people of Guangxi. Of course, the Ministry of Higher Education has always been concerned about education in Guangxi. It may not be considered due to issues such as funding and teachers. Now some provinces do not have universities, not just Guangxi. However, I believe that the situations in various provinces are different, and the conditions are different, so they cannot be compared. Establishing a university in a region with relatively backward culture and many ethnic minorities, cultivating their children, and improving their culture, spending some money, cannot be said to have a great impact, and the state has no budget. Furthermore, if it is thought that there is a lack of teachers, according to my understanding, there are many Zhuang professors and lecturers in Guangxi who are scattered in various provinces teaching. They have expressed their willingness to return if Guangxi University is restored. Also, Guangxi University, from the perspective of its training objects, should have a certain number of ethnic minority teachers to meet the actual educational requirements of this region. It is not too late for the government to start cultivating them now. Many Zhuang, Dong, and other ethnic groups have the ability to do so, as long as the Ministry of Higher Education is willing to transfer and cultivate them, it is not difficult to do. Therefore, I hope that Guangxi University can be restored in the next one or two years. Please the Ministry of Higher Education consider, consider, and consider again! ! !
    In addition, Guangxi's scientific research institutions, except for a few people in the Guangxi Branch of the South China Botanical Research Institute, most of the research institutions in various departments have not been established. At present, the scientific research work of the three colleges in Guangxi (Normal, Agricultural, and Medical Colleges) is also not carried out well, and the research funding is extremely limited or non-existent. According to Vice President Wang of Guangxi Normal College: In recent years, scientific research work has not been able to be carried out due to lack of funding. I hope that I will reflect this matter in Beijing. For example, the area of Guiping and Guixian in Guangxi is the birthplace of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution. Some universities in Beijing have sent students to investigate, but the students of the Department of History of Guangxi Normal College, which is very close at hand, have been making investigation budgets every year since 1953, but they have never been approved due to lack of money.
    In short, I believe that the government's cultural and educational leading departments should not only pay attention to, but also pay more attention to, cultural and educational undertakings and scientific research work in remote areas, especially in areas where many ethnic minorities live.

    请看僮族自治地区几年来的巨大变化：
    粮食由不足变为有余，工业产值增加三十倍
    黄现璠说：别有野心的人故意抹煞成绩，各族人民应该鸣鼓而攻之！
    我对于政府首长各项报告完全同意。对于大会若果通过成立广西僮族自治区，我是僮族代表，更加拥护，衷心感谢！
    自一九五二年桂西僮族自治区成立，去年改为州，由于党和政府正确领导，不断的关怀照顾，几年来，取得很大的成绩。全州解放前，粮食一向不能自给，一九五六年全州农户百分之九十八点八参加农业合作社，得到增产，一九五六年粮食达到五十六亿多斤，比解放前最高年产量增加百分之三十左右。不但足以自给，且有余粮支援国家社会主义建设。厂矿企业，发展也快。解放前，它们没有几个，解放后到一九五六年底，共有四百七十八个，比解放初期增加三倍多。一九五六年，全州工业总产值达一亿二千五百五十四万元，比解放初期增加三十倍。其他交通、文教、卫生等事业也取得不少成绩，因而人民生活得到不少的改善，全州人民购买力以人民币计，一九五三年为一千九百九十二万元，一九五四年为九千五百万元，比上年度增加百分之四百七十六。一九五四年以后增加更多。僮族自治州如此，全国各地可想而知。谁说我国几年来建设，由于有了党的领导，成绩不是主要的、非常显著的？右派分子，别有野心的故意抹煞成绩，夸大缺点，和妄想取消党的领导，是错误的、反动的。全国各族人民，应该“鸣鼓而攻之”。
    现在我想就发展桂西生产事业和广西文化教育发表一些意见。
    广西面积共二十一万八千多平方公里，僮、苗、瑶、侗等少数民族住区占百分之七十，汉族占百分之三十（可看大会发拙著广西僮族简史插图）。少数民族住区，有一个特点，就是山岭较多，土质较坏，生产力低，生活艰苦。右江革命根据地的巴马东兰一带，流行这样一首民谣：“西山山高高如天，生来粥水过终年，要想食饱穿得暖，除非石山变成钱。”僮族人民生存在这样地理环境，须要特别辛勤劳动和发展各种生产事业，才能克服困难，解决生活。
    不过这种地理环境，固有它的坏处，也有它的好处，它的土特产特别众多，约五百多种，产量较大的约一百七十种，是搞副业很好的自然条件。奈因许多品种，如天冬花粉、黄青、首乌等，政府虽已收购，价格颇低。隆林地区，一个人一天劳动得不到三角钱。白干参、牛七、山山七、五环草等，一般认为有价值，但政府现今尚未收购没有牌价。我最近到百色专区去视察，不少地区民族贸易局尚没很好的贯彻“不赚不赔、有赚有赔和以赚补赔”的民族贸易政策，土特产得不到应有的重视，不能刺激鼓励农民生产，更谈不到发展。我希望民族贸易方面，对于土特产，合理的给与价格和适当的提高价格，以及适当的尽量的收购。
    桂西僮族地区矿藏特别丰富，据几年来勘探，有色金属、黑色金属、稀有金属和非金属矿产分布很广。广西全省铅锌等矿藏，绝大部分都在僮族和其他少数民族地区，最近全省新发现八种矿产，七十个有矿地区中就有五十二个在僮族地区。它们的贮量也很丰富。如煤的贮量，占全省贮量的百分之九十二，锰的贮量，占全省贮量的百分之九十。因此，在这个地区，政府应逐步发展工矿事业。同时桂西一带地广人稀，人口密度平均每平方公里五十人强，可以利用的土地面积相当的多，是提供发展经济作物、土特产、畜牧和森林等事业很好的地理条件，如百色隆林等县，就有不少水草丰足的很广大的天然牧场，可以用钱少而收益多。若政府予以重视、投资，把这些旷地和各种矿藏逐步开辟发掘利用起来，不独可以改善僮族和其他少数民族地区的经济状况，即对于祖国社会主义的建设也是有利。
    再，广西文化教育事业，几年来由于党的领导，取得不少成绩；特别是僮文创造之成功，是僮族人民破天荒的一件大喜事。但是，一般来说，广西文化教育的发展仍然很迟慢。所以我希望最近能够恢复成立广西大学。一九五五年全国统一招生，广西考生成绩不好，取录很少，而左右两江红水河的僮族子弟取录更少。原因固非一端，惟中学教师质量较差，大有关系。我几年来，常到以上各地去视察，各中学教师，大学和专科学院毕业或肄业的，一般不及十分之四，多数是高中毕业。崇左中学一位教师对我说：“我是旧制中学毕业，原没学过某课程，因无人担任要我教，我备课很苦，收效仍不大。”并且为发展广西各种工矿和其他生产事业必须有各种建设技术人才，而这些人才，广西现在正十分缺乏，亟须培养。过去有些地区，没有大学，最近为培养建设人才，都先后建立起来，广西大学也就该早些恢复。惟近据有关方面消息：“高教部对于恢复广西大学，第二个五年计划内，尚未考虑到”，这样延迟，殊非广西人民的愿望。固然，高教部对于广西教育一向是关心的。可能因经费、教师等问题，故不予以考虑。今有些省份，也没有大学，不单独广西。不过我认为各省情况不同，条件互异，不能相提并论。在文化比较落后和有很多少数民族的地区，成立一个大学，培养他们子弟，提高他们文化，用些钱，不能说就发生很大影响，国家没有预算。再若以为教师缺乏，据我了解，广西仅僮族教授讲师，分散在各省教书的就不少，广西大学恢复，他们曾经表示愿意回来。又广西大学恢复，从它培养的对象，理应有一定数量少数民族教师才能合这个地区教育实际要求，现今政府若即着手培养，尚且未晚，僮、侗等族子弟有许多足以胜任，只要高教部愿意调用和肯加栽培，事是不难办的。所以我希望广西大学能在最近一、二年内恢复，请高教部考虑，考虑，再考虑！！！
    此外，广西科学研究机构，除华南植物研究所广西分所寥寥数人外，各部门的研究机构多未建立起来，今广西三个学院（师范、农和医学院），科学研究工作开展也不够好，研究经费极其有限或者没有。据广西师院王副院长对我说：近年来，因没有经费，无法开展科学研究工作，望我到北京反映此事。例如广西桂平、贵县一带，是太平天国革命的发祥地，北京有些大学尚派学生去调查，但近在咫尺的广西师院历史系学生，自一九五三年起，年年都造调查预算，因没有钱，始终不得批准去。
    总之，我认为边远地区，特别是有不少少数民族居住的地区，文化教育事业和科学研究工作，政府的文化教育领导部门，不但应该注意，而且应该多多注意才对。
