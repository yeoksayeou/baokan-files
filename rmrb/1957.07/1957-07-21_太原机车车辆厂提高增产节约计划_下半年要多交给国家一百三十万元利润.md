    Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant Improves Production Increase and Savings Plan
    To Hand Over 1.3 Million Yuan More in Profits to the State in the Second Half of the Year
    (Our report) According to the *Shanxi Daily*, workers at the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory completed 98% of their annual profit delivery plan in the first half of the year. Recently, they held another workers' representative conference to continue tapping potential, proposing new production increase and savings plans and specific measures to complete the plan, deciding to increase profit delivery to the state by another 1.3 million yuan in the second half of the year.
    Before the workers' representative conference, the factory's trade union organized more than twenty worker representatives, along with relevant technical and management personnel, to form two inspection teams, going deep into departments and workshops to conduct a comprehensive and detailed inspection of the factory's production increase and savings, labor protection, and welfare aspects. The inspection revealed that the completion of the state production plan in the first half of the year was good, but leading cadres and the masses of workers had varying degrees of pride and complacency, and the movement to increase production and practice economy lacked a comprehensive perspective, neglecting the improvement of quality and the saving of management expenses. Therefore, there was still considerable potential for increasing production and practicing economy. The worker representatives, while inspecting, absorbed the opinions of the workers and put forward 147 improvement measures and criticisms.
    The factory's administrative leaders listened attentively to the worker representatives' criticisms of enterprise management and leadership style, carefully studied the various improvement suggestions put forward by the worker representatives, and organized technical and management personnel and workshop directors to conduct a thorough accounting of various economic and technical indicators, identified loopholes in production waste, and adopted more than twenty production increase and savings measures. At the same time, the Party committee inspected and criticized the conservative attitude and complacent and lax mood of some leading cadres toward revising the production increase and savings plan. Thus, after several discussions and studies, the originally planned profit delivery in the annual production increase and savings plan was finally raised from 1.53 million yuan to 2.8 million yuan, and this figure was specifically allocated to each workshop. The workers' representative conference unanimously passed a resolution guaranteeing efforts to achieve this production increase and savings plan.

    太原机车车辆厂提高增产节约计划
    下半年要多交给国家一百三十万元利润
    本报讯　山西日报消息：太原机车车辆修理工厂职工上半年完成了全年上缴利润计划的98％。最近，他们又举行职工代表大会，继续挖掘潜力，提出了新的增产节约计划和完成计划的具体措施，决定下半年再给国家增加上缴利润一百三十万元。
    职工代表大会召开以前，厂工会组织二十多个职工代表，同有关技术、管理人员组成两个视察检查小组，深入科室、车间，对全厂增产节约、劳动保护和生活福利等方面的情况，进行了全面细致的检查。检查中发现，上半年完成国家生产计划情况较好，但是领导干部和职工群众中，存在着不同程度的骄傲、自满情绪，增产节约运动中缺乏全面观点，忽视提高质量和节约管理费用，因此还有不少增产节约的潜力。职工代表们一边检查，一边吸收职工意见，提出了一百四十七项改进措施和批评意见。
    工厂行政领导人员虚心听取了职工代表对企业管理、领导作风方面的批评，认真研究了职工代表提出的各项改进意见，组织技术、管理人员和车间主任，从各项经济技术指标上进行摸底算账，找出了生产中浪费的漏洞，采取了二十多项增产节约措施。同时，党委会检查批判了部分领导干部对修改增产节约计划的保守态度和自满松懈情绪。这样，经过数次讨论研究，最后把原定全年增产节约计划中的上缴利润，由一百五十三万元提高到二百八十万元，并将这个数字具体分配到各个车间。职工代表大会一致通过决议，保证努力实现这个增产节约计划。
