Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: The State Council issued a notice on the 13th regarding strengthening heatstroke prevention and cooling measures in enterprises.

The notice stated that heatstroke prevention and cooling measures in enterprises are important measures related to the health of employees and ensuring the completion of production tasks. In recent years, due to the emphasis placed on heatstroke prevention and cooling measures by enterprise leaders, many enterprises have not had heatstroke accidents for more than three years; however, there are still some enterprises that have either not paid enough attention to heatstroke prevention and cooling measures, relaxing timely arrangements and specific leadership for heatstroke prevention and cooling work, thus affecting the health of employees; or due to a lack of technical knowledge and experience in heatstroke prevention and cooling, many cooling equipment investments have yielded little benefit, and some have even made technical errors.

In order to make enterprises universally value and strengthen heatstroke prevention and cooling work, prevent heatstroke accidents, and ensure the completion of production tasks, the notice puts forward the following requirements:

I. The People's Committees of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should uniformly organize forces, coordinate with industrial and transportation management departments and labor and health departments, and with the participation of trade union organizations, to conduct an inspection of the heatstroke prevention and cooling work of local enterprises. Experiences worthy of promotion in heatstroke prevention and cooling measures should be organized for experience exchange among enterprises in the same industry or of the same type; for units that neglect heatstroke prevention and cooling work and seriously affect the health of employees, they should be urged to quickly take effective measures to improve the situation.

II. The industrial and transportation departments of the State Council should pay close attention to the heatstroke prevention and cooling situation of their subordinate enterprises and actively assist in the inspection of the heatstroke prevention and cooling work of their subordinate enterprises; organize a certain force to conduct inspections in key units or units with relatively weak heatstroke prevention and cooling work, and urge them to strengthen heatstroke prevention and cooling work; for the materials, funds, and technical forces necessary for subordinate enterprises to improve heatstroke prevention and cooling that are possible to achieve, they should actively resolve them.

III. The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Health should also actively help local governments and departments to do a good job in this heatstroke prevention and cooling work in coordination with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; invite several experts as much as possible to assist local governments in strengthening technical guidance for heatstroke prevention and cooling work in enterprises. After the summer, they should cooperate with relevant departments to summarize this year's heatstroke prevention and cooling work, propose improvement measures, and make preparations for next year's heatstroke prevention and cooling work as early as possible.

IV. Heatstroke prevention and cooling work must implement the spirit of economy. The addition of new cooling equipment should take measures that cost less, yield greater results, and produce quick results; and the focus of work should be placed on inspecting the original heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment, managing and using the original heatstroke prevention and cooling equipment well, and having a rational management and application system.

    国务院通知各地企业加强防暑降温工作
    新华社14日讯　国务院在13日发出关于加强企业中的防暑降温工作的通知。
    通知说，企业的防暑降温工作是关系职工群众身体健康和保证完成生产任务的一项重要措施。几年来由于企业领导方面的重视防暑降温工作，不少企业已有三年多未发生中暑事故；但是尚有一部分企业，或者由于对防暑降温工作重视不够，放松了对防暑降温工作进行及时布置和具体领导，因而影响了职工健康；或者由于缺乏防暑降温的技术知识和缺乏经验，以致不少降温设备花钱多收效少，甚至还有的发生了技术上错误。
    为了使企业中普遍重视和加强防暑降温工作，防止发生中暑事故，保证完成生产任务，通知提出如下要求：
    一、各省、市、自治区人民委员会应该统一组织力量，协同工业、交通管理部门和劳动卫生部门，并吸收工会组织参加，将当地企业的防暑降温工作进行一次检查，对防暑降温措施中值得推广的经验，应该组织同一行业或同一类型的企业进行经验交流；对于忽视防暑降温工作严重影响职工健康的单位，应当督促他们迅速采取有效措施，加以改善。
    二、国务院各工业、交通部门应该密切注视所属企业的防暑降温情况并积极协助各地检查所属企业的防暑降温工作；组织一定力量，有重点的或在防暑降温工作比较薄弱的单位，进行检查，督促他们加强防暑降温工作；对于所属企业改善防暑降温所必需而又可能办到的资材、经费和技术力量，应该积极予以解决。
    三、劳动部、卫生部也应该协同全国总工会积极帮助各地、各部门做好这次防暑降温工作；尽可能邀请若干专家协助各地加强企业中防暑降温工作的技术指导。在暑期过后，应协同各有关部门总结今年防暑降温工作，提出改进措施，及早为明年防暑降温工作作好准备。
    四、防暑降温工作，必须贯彻节约精神。对添置新的降温设备应该采取花钱少、收效大、收效快的办法；并应把工作的重点放在检查原有的防暑降温设备上，使原有的防暑降温设备管好、用好，有合理的管理和运用制度。
