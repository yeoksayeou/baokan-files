Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – According to the “Akahata” newspaper, Japanese Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary Sanzo Nosaka recently told the newspaper's reporter that the upcoming Seventh National Congress of the Japanese Communist Party will be of epoch-making significance in the party's history. It will further strengthen the ideological and organizational unity of the Japanese Communist Party and enable the party to develop further.

    In answering questions from the "Akahata" reporter, Nosaka said that this congress has a special task: it must not only summarize the work since the Sixth National Congress and determine the policies on current issues; it must also summarize the party's work over the past decade, including the internal party problems after 1950. The agenda of the congress includes: the work report of the Central Committee, the program issue, the revision of the Party Constitution, and the election of leading cadres. Nosaka said that the issues included in these agenda items are extremely important and complex. We must concentrate the wisdom of the whole party, carefully deliberate on them, and draw correct conclusions.

    Nosaka said that in terms of preparatory work, we first started with the program issue. The Seventh and Eighth Central Committee meetings have decided to propose to the Seventh National Congress suggestions on discussing and revising the Party's New Program of 1951. In order to submit a proposal on the program issue to the Seventh National Congress, the Ninth Central Committee meeting held in November of last year appointed a Program Committee composed of twelve members. At the same time, research materials and discussions on the "Program Issue" were successively published in the "Zenei" magazine. The Program Committee has held seventeen meetings so far. In addition, six subcommittees were established to study international situation, state power, monopoly capital, agriculture, mass movements, and documents, respectively. Each subcommittee has held six to eighteen meetings, respectively. The Central Committee Enlarged Meeting has also conducted four discussions on key issues. Currently, it has reached the stage where the Program Committee will submit specific proposals to the Central Committee soon.

    Nosaka said that regarding the issue of revising the draft Party Constitution adopted by the Sixth National Congress, the Party Constitution Revision Committee appointed by the Central Committee has discussed it about thirty times, and the revised draft is roughly ready.

    Nosaka said that regarding the internal party problems that occurred after the Sixth National Congress held in December 1947, the Central Committee is also conducting discussions in order to give a correct political assessment and thereby draw lessons.

    Nosaka finally said that the date of the congress will be decided by the Central Committee soon and then announced.

    总结过去工作　决定当前方针
    日共将召开全国代表大会
    野坂强调会议在党史中的划时代意义
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”报道，日本共产党中央委员会第一书记野坂参三最近对这家报纸的记者说，正在筹备中的日本共产党第七次全国代表大会将在党的历史上具有划时代的意义。它将进一步加强日本共产党在思想上和组织上的团结，使党更加向前发展。
    野坂在回答“赤旗报”记者的问题时说，这次代表大会负有特别的任务，它不仅要总结第六次全国代表会议以后的工作，决定关于当前各项问题的方针；同时还要总结包括1950年以后的党内问题在内的过去十年来党的工作。大会的议程有：中央委员会的工作报告、纲领问题、修改党章和选举领导干部。野坂说，这些议程中所包括的问题都是极其重要和复杂的。必须集中全党的智慧，慎重地加以审议，并且作出正确的结论。
    野坂说，在筹备工作方面，我们首先着手进行的是纲领问题。第七次和第八次中央委员会会议已经决定向第七次全国代表大会提出关于讨论、修改1951年党的新纲领的建议。为了向第七次全国代表大会提出关于纲领问题的提案，在去年11月举行的第九次中央委员会会议任命成立了由十二人组成的纲领问题委员会。与此同时，陆续在“前卫”杂志上发表了关于“纲领问题”的研究资料和讨论。纲领问题委员会到现在已经举行了十七次会议。另外，还成立了六个小组委员会分别研究国际形势、国家权力、垄断资本、农业、群众运动、文献等问题，各小组委员会已经分别举行了六次到十八次会议。中央委员会扩大会议也已就关键性问题进行了四次讨论。目前，已经到了由纲领问题委员会在最近向中央委员会提出具体方案的阶段。
    野坂说，关于修改第六次全国代表会议所通过的党章草案问题，中央委员会任命的修改党章委员会已经讨论了三十次左右，修改草案大致已经准备好了。
    野坂说，关于从1947年12月举行的第六次全国代表大会以后发生的党内问题，中央委员会也正在进行讨论，以便在政治上给予正确的估价，从而吸取经验教训。
    野坂最后说，关于召开大会的日期，不久将由中央委员会作出决定后加以公布。
