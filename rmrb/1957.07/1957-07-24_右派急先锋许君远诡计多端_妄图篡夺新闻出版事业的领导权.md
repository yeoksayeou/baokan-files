　　Shanghai’s rightist element Xu Junyuan often refers to himself as a "veteran journalist." The background of this "veteran journalist" is indeed not simple. Not to mention the distant past, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, Xu Junyuan served as the deputy editor-in-chief of the Chongqing Kuomintang Central Daily News and as the personal secretary of Yu Bin, a war criminal and a degenerate in religious circles. Due to Yu Bin's favor, in 1945 he served as a special correspondent for the staunchly anti-communist Yi Shi Bao, covering the San Francisco United Nations Conference news. Before and after the liberation of Shanghai, he served as the editing director and head of the data room of Shanghai Ta Kung Pao. During this period, Xu Junyuan did an excellent job for the reactionaries. In San Francisco, he issued a large number of reports slandering the Soviet delegation. While American soldiers committed murder, robbery, and all sorts of evil deeds in China, Xu Junyuan whitewashed them, saying that "many American soldiers fighting in the Far East helped their countrymen increase their understanding and goodwill towards China." On the very day Shanghai was liberated, Xu Junyuan still used a Central News Agency news release, both in the title and in the text, to call the Communist Party "Communist bandits."

　　After liberation, the people did not "settle old scores" with Xu Junyuan, but gave him the opportunity to work and reform himself (he is currently the deputy director of the First Editorial Office of the Shanghai Culture Publishing House). However, Xu Junyuan has consistently been dissatisfied with the Party and with socialism. Like all rightist elements, during the rectification campaign, Xu Junyuan believed that "the time had come" and launched a frenzied attack on the Party and the news and publication industry it leads.

　　"Should newspapers continue to operate like this?" On May 21, Xu Junyuan used such a provocative title to publish an article in Wenhui Bao that negated the working class's line in running newspapers and promoted the bourgeoisie's line in running newspapers.

　　In this programmatic article, which was both theoretical and systematic, Xu Junyuan released many poisonous arrows. The first poisonous arrow was to deny the achievements of newspaper work since liberation, to try to uglify the Party newspaper and the people's newspapers led by the Party, in order to negate the socialist direction of newspapers. Xu Junyuan slanderously said that "newspapers after liberation only preach," "lecture with a straight face all day long," and "put on the face of a Party member, without a smile." "To be frank, there is a high wall between the newspaper and the reader." How to tear down the wall? Here, Xu Junyuan greatly peddled the theory of "taste." Newspapers should be interesting, but what kind of taste did Xu Junyuan want? Nothing but "food and sex," "British news figure Tang Sheng in Beijing does not talk about his love affair with the princess," "Calligraphy, chess, painting, and calligraphy...contain rich nutrition"... Xu Junyuan boasted that "the stronger the taste, the more attractive it is; the more newspapers can attract readers, the more they can play a guiding role." He even described taste as "a fine tradition of Chinese newspapers." The reason why Xu Junyuan vigorously promoted the theory of taste was actually to oppose newspapers promoting Marxism-Leninism, promoting the Party's policies, and opposing the guiding role of newspapers.

　　This "veteran journalist," while wantonly belittling today's people's newspapers, did not conceal his nostalgia for the Ta Kung Pao, which "helped the big boss by scolding him a little" under Chiang Kai-shek's rule before liberation. He said: "In the past, I often heard people say, 'I have been a reader of Ta Kung Pao for twenty years,' and the words were filled with deep friendship, which made people feel very comfortable. After liberation, few people do not read the People's Daily, but no one says that he is an old friend of the People's Daily." He blatantly demanded that the Party newspapers of today be reformed with the bourgeois newspaper management policy of the pre-liberation Ta Kung Pao.

　　Another poisonous arrow released by Xu Junyuan was the demand for "freedom of the press." In his view, our newspapers have very serious rules and regulations, not only in the editorial department, but also "the pressure from readers is great." He "suggests that the Party newspaper should be more lenient in the selection of news and play a leading role." He demanded that today's journalists once again become "uncrowned kings." The leading organs must not treat journalists as ordinary office cadres, otherwise, they "will make them feel inferior." And journalists cannot be satisfied with being responsible to the people and to the socialist cause. He said, "Is it enough to only talk about 'responsibility'?" We must also learn some "special skills" from the "uncrowned kings" of the old society, that is, "striding into the doors of 'adults and gentlemen'," interviewing whatever they want, "being invincible," and "even being able to figure out the ins and outs behind the news."

　　When Xu Junyuan wrote this article, it was precisely when the rightist elements had already launched a frenzied attack, and Wenhui Bao had become a major tool of the rightists, when rightist remarks on the newspaper had already covered the sun like a dark cloud. Still, Xu Junyuan felt unsatisfied, saying that the newspaper was not released thoroughly or widely, and demanded that the newspaper relax its news standards and let go of its fire. He used inflammatory language to challenge the Party newspaper: "Everyone is shouting 'tear down the wall,' and the Party newspaper still wants to build a fortress and stick to its own ways. If this continues, how can we guide the work of uniting Party and non-Party comrades?" "Staying in the same old rut and falling behind other newspapers is not the best policy."

　　In this challenge to the Party and the Party's newspapers, Xu Junyuan also released some poisonous arrows. At the end of this challenge, he raised "a question": "The voices of people running schools and people running periodicals have been shouted out. Then, can we consider people running newspapers?" Running a "people's newspaper" for rightist elements is precisely the goal that Xu Junyuan has been pursuing for a long time. According to revelations from people in Shanghai's news industry, this "veteran journalist," who has close ties with Lu Yi, Gu Zhizhong, and others, has already made specific preparations for running a "people's newspaper."

　　Although Xu Junyuan is a "veteran journalist" with "more than 20 years of experience in running newspapers," he is currently working in a publishing house; if you think that what he is attacking is only the news front and that he will give up the publishing house as a position, then you would underestimate this rightist "hero."

　　Xu Junyuan in Shanghai Culture Publishing House usually finds various excuses not to attend the meetings. But once the rectification started, he enthusiastically attended the meetings, and he always made separate records for each meeting. When the company established the "System Reform Group," he automatically signed up to participate, and he also recommended members of the group, and he was responsible for convening the meetings. Why is Xu Junyuan so interested in the "system" issue? It turns out that the Culture Publishing House was transformed from the Four Joint Publishing Houses (Beixin, Guangyi, Ren Shijian, etc.), Chunming, Guoguang, Wenyu and other private publishing houses. Xu Junyuan (he was originally from the Four Joint Publishing Houses) was unwilling to this transformation, so he used the great opportunity of "blooming" and "contending" to plan a restoration, inciting the capitalists of these bookstores to restore private ownership, and even asking Huang Jiayin to restore the "home" publishing house and "West Wind" magazine that had already closed down. This is how he painstakingly tried to undermine the publishing houses led by the Party and drag the publishing industry back to the old road of capitalism.

　　Just like he wanted to run a "people's newspaper," Xu Junyuan also wanted to run a "people's publishing house" and a "expert publishing house." He even drafted a list of more than 20 people for a people's publishing house, but there was not a single Party member or Youth League member.

　　Xu Junyuan's hatred of the Communist Party and opposition to socialism has been consistent. When the private publishing house he worked for was changed to a joint state-private enterprise, he spread the word that "after the joint state-private enterprise, it will be difficult to do things with Party members leading." After the publishing house had Party leadership, he said: "This climate is very bad," "Party members in the publishing house are monitoring the masses." He used various opportunities to attack Party members and comrades who were close to the Party. He generally denounced all Party members or comrades transferred from the organization as "low-energy" and "laymen." He even said: "It is a waste for the higher-ups to send people here, and it is unfair to the people." His ulterior motive was to drive away the Communist Party members. Xu Junyuan greatly wooed people who were dissatisfied with the Party or had been subjected to government scrutiny. He is a member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. At a debate, a comrade expressed opinions that differed from those of some Party members, and he gave him a thumbs up and praised him, and tried his best to have the Peasants' and Workers' branch admit him to the Party. Xu Zhongnian taught at the Foreign Languages ​​Institute. Because he and Xu Junyuan had similar tastes, he was also introduced by him and developed from a member of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party's Cultural Publishing House branch to a Party member. In the past, when he was in the China Academic Society, Xu Junyuan opposed the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and shielded reactionary elements. In this "blooming" and "contending," Xu Junyuan also "spoke out for justice" for the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng, saying that "Hu Feng has talent," "Why not let Hu Feng out to let him bloom?" When the Shanghai Journalism School ended in 1954, the students were assigned to work in various departments in consideration of the students' actual situation and work needs. Xu Junyuan and some people with ulterior motives secretly gathered in June this year to incite them to march and petition and fight against the Communist Party cadres.

### 右派急先锋许君远诡计多端  妄图篡夺新闻出版事业的领导权

    右派急先锋许君远诡计多端
    妄图篡夺新闻出版事业的领导权
    本报综合消息：上海的右派分子许君远经常以“老报人”自居。这位“老报人”的来历，也真不简单。远的不说，抗战时期，许君远就当过重庆国民党中央日报的副总编辑，做过战犯也是宗教界败类于斌的私人秘书，由于于斌的青睐，1945年当过坚决反共的益世报的特派记者，采访过旧金山联合国大会新闻，上海解放前后又担任上海大公报的编辑主任和资料室主任。许君远在这段时期，为反动派做了很出色的工作。在旧金山的时候，他发了大量污蔑苏联代表团的报道。美国兵在中国杀人、抢劫，无恶不作，许君远却给他们搽粉，说什么“许多到远东作战的美国士兵，帮助他们国人对中国增加认识，增加好感”。就在上海刚解放的一天，许君远还是用中央社的新闻稿，不论在标题和文内骂共产党为“共匪”。
    解放以后，人民并没有跟许君远“算旧账”，给了他工作和改造自己的机会（他现在是上海文化出版社第一编辑室副主任）。可是许君远却一贯对党、对社会主义不满。像一切右派分子一样，就在整风期间，许君远认为“时候到了”，向党和党所领导的新闻出版事业发起了猖狂的进攻。
    “报纸应当这样干下去吗？”5月21日，许君远用了这样一个富于煽动性的题目，在文汇报发表了一篇否定工人阶级办报路线、宣传资产阶级办报路线的文章。
    在这篇有理论、有系统的办报纲领中，许君远放出了许多毒箭。第一枝毒箭是否定解放以来报纸工作的成绩，尽量丑化党报和党所领导的人民报纸，借以否定报纸的社会主义方向。许君远诬蔑说：“解放后的报纸只顾说教”，“成天板起面孔来说道理”，“摆着党员面孔，没有笑容”。“说坦白些，就是报纸和读者之间有了一道高墙”。怎样拆墙呢？在这里，许君远大大地贩卖了一通趣味论。报纸是得有趣味，但是许君远要的是什么样的趣味呢？不是别的，是“食色性也”，“英国新闻人物唐生在京不谈与公主恋爱事”，“琴棋书画……含有丰富的营养”……。许君远鼓吹说：“趣味性越强，越能引人入胜；报纸越能大量争取读者，越能发挥指导性的作用”。他甚至把趣味说成“中国报纸的一种优良传统”。许君远所以大肆宣传趣味论，其实是要反对报纸宣传马列主义，宣传党的政策，反对报纸的指导作用。
    这位“老报人”在肆意诋毁今天的人民报纸的时候，丝毫也不掩盖他对于解放前对蒋介石统治“小骂大帮忙”的大公报的缅怀。他说：“过去常常听人讲起，‘我是大公报二十年的读者了’，话里弥漫着深厚的友情，叫人听起来很舒服。解放后很少人不看人民日报，但却没有人说他是人民日报的老朋友。”他露骨地要求以解放前大公报的资产阶级办报方针来改造今天的党报。
    许君远放出的另一枝毒箭是要求“新闻自由”。在他看来，我们报纸的清规戒律很严重，不但编辑部如此，而且“读者的压力是大的”。他“建议，在选择新闻上，党报的尺度应该更放宽些，起个带头作用”。他要求今天的新闻记者重新成为“无冕之王”。领导机关不能把新闻记者当作一般机关干部看待，那样就“会使他们产生自卑的情绪”。而记者也不能满足于对人民负责，对社会主义事业负责。他说，“只谈‘负责’就够了吗？”还要向旧社会的“无冕之王”学习一些“特长”，即“昂首阔步出入于‘大人先生’之门”，要采访什么就采访什么，“无往而不利”，“甚至对新闻幕后的来龙去脉也能摸个清清楚楚”。
    许君远写这篇文章的时候，正是右派分子已经猖狂进攻，文汇报已经成为右派主要工具，报纸上右派言论已经像一片乌云遮住了太阳的时候，而许君远犹感未足，说报纸放得不透、不广，要求报纸放宽新闻尺度，大放其火。他用煽动性的语言向党报将了一军：“大家都在喊叫‘拆墙’，党报还想筑寨自固，长此以往，如何指导党与非党同志的团结工作？”“故步自封，落在其他报纸后面，并非上计”。
    在这份向党和党的报纸的挑战书中，许君远还放了一些毒箭。而在这份挑战书的结尾，他提了“一个问题”：“目前同人办学校、同人办刊物的声音喊出来了，那么同人办报是不是也可以考虑呢？”办一张右派分子的“同人报纸”，正是许君远追求已久的目标。据上海新闻界人士揭发，这位和陆诒、顾执中等往来密切的“老报人”，已经作了办“同人报纸”的具体准备。
    许君远虽然是一个“有二十多年办报经验”的“老报人”，但目前是身在出版社；如果以为他所进攻的只是新闻这条战线，而会放弃出版社这个阵地，那就未免小看了这名右派“英雄”了。
    许君远平日在上海文化出版社，常常寻找各种借口，不参加社的会议。但是整风一开始，他参加会议就起劲了，每次出席必另作记录。社里成立“体制小组”，他自动报名参加，而且推荐小组成员，由他负责召集会议。许君远对“体制”问题为什么这样感兴趣呢？原来文化出版社是由四联出版社（北新、广益、人世间等）、春明、国光、文娱等私营出版社改造而成的。许君远（他原是四联的）是不甘心于这种改造的，就利用“鸣”“放”的绝好机会策划复辟，煽动这些书店的资方恢复私营，甚至要黄嘉音恢复早已歇业了的“家”出版社和“西风”杂志。他就是这样处心积虑地要搞垮党领导的出版社，要把出版事业拖回到资本主义的老路上去。
    就像他想办“同人报纸”一样，许君远还想搞什么“同人出版社”、“专家出版社”。他甚至拟定了一个包括二十多人的同人出版社的名单，可就是没有一个党员或团员。
    许君远仇视共产党、反对社会主义是一贯的。当他工作的私营出版社改为公私合营的时候，他放空气说：“公私合营后，有党员领导，就不好搞了。”在出版社有了党的领导后，他就说：“这种气候很不好”，“党员在出版社是监视群众的”。他利用各种机会打击党员，打击靠拢党的同志，凡是党员或机关调来的同志，他一概斥之为“低能”、“外行”，他甚至说：“上面派人来是浪费，对不起人民。”其不可告人的目的就是赶走共产党员。对党不满或者受过政府审查的人，许君远就大加拉拢。他是农工民主党的成员。在一次辩论会上有位同志发表了与有些党员不同的意见，他就翘起大拇指叫好，竭力要农工支部吸收他入党。徐仲年是在外国语学院教书的，由于和许君远臭味相投，也经他介绍，由农工民主党文化出版社支部发展为党员。过去在中华学艺社的时候，许君远曾经反对肃反，包庇反动分子。在这次“鸣”“放”中，许君远还为反革命分子胡风“申冤”，说“胡风有才华”，“为什么不把胡风放出来让他开开花？”1954年上海新闻学校结束时，考虑到学生的实际情况和工作需要，曾将学员分配到各部门去工作。许君远和有些别有用心的分子，就在今年6月秘密集会，煽动他们游行请愿，斗争共产党的干部。
