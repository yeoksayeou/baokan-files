Learn from the People's Liberation Army and Carry the Anti-Rightist Struggle Through to the End
Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League

Every "August 1st" Army Day further stirs our respect and love for the Chinese People's Liberation Army. To learn from the PLA's fine traditions, to learn from the PLA's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people under the leadership of the Communist Party, is the desire of every progressive person. This year, as we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the PLA, which also coincides with the nationwide struggle of the people to counterattack the bourgeois rightists and launch a fierce struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism in politics and ideology, learning from the PLA is of even greater significance.

What should we learn from the PLA? The Chinese People's Liberation Army was created and organized by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao; it is a people's armed force that has grown through constant education and training. It not only has fine military traditions, but more importantly, it has fine political traditions. Chairman Mao said: "A person without correct political views is like a soul without a body." When building the army, the Chinese Communist Party, starting from the Red Army era, first gave the PLA a great soul. This great soul has enabled the PLA to have the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, fearing no difficulties, and fearing no sacrifice. This is the heart of a great communist who is willing to sacrifice himself for the liberation of all mankind. It is extremely important for us, members of the China Democratic League, to strive to learn this spirit.

Our members of the China Democratic League are intellectuals who grew up in the old society and were educated in bourgeois schools. From a class composition point of view, the vast majority come from bourgeois or petty-bourgeois families. Although many of them participated in the revolution during the bourgeois democratic revolution, and most of them expressed their support for the socialist system after liberation, and many have worked hard to study Marxism and sincerely carry out self-reform, making varying degrees of progress in their thinking, most of the members still retain more or less bourgeois ideas and are politically in an intermediate state; a considerable number of them are full of bourgeois ideas, oppose the Communist Party and socialism, and are bourgeois rightists in politics. These rightists are creating trouble. Facts revealed recently by the people of the whole country show that the rightists have dragged part of the organization of the China Democratic League backward and onto the bourgeois road. Many members have lost their political direction and are following them to varying degrees. Now, as the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance and other rightists to oppose communism and socialism has been exposed, the people of the whole country have launched a counterattack against the rampant attacks of the bourgeois rightists, and our China Democratic League and other democratic parties have awakened from a state of ambiguity, realizing the poisonous harm of the rightists' opposition to communism, the people, and socialism; realizing that as an intellectual, as a member of the China Democratic League, one must first stand firm politically and draw a clear line with the rightists, otherwise one will degenerate into an enemy of the people.

However, having such awareness is not enough. To be able to resolutely stand firm politically, it is necessary to truly transform one's own position, sincerely accept Marxism, and accept the leadership of the Communist Party in the in-depth anti-rightist struggle, in the normal rectification in the future, and in daily self-reform work, so that one has a correct world outlook. Only such people truly have a "soul" and a heart to serve the people.

How to transform oneself? In addition to studying Marxism, it is more important to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is what the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have repeatedly taught us. Workers are our teachers, and the People's Liberation Army is our teacher. Therefore, when commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the army, we members of the China Democratic League should make a grand wish to learn from the People's Liberation Army, and at present, in particular, to learn from the People's Liberation Army's incomparably heroic, resolute, and unwavering fighting spirit, and to carry the struggle against the bourgeois rightists through to the end. All intellectuals must be determined to pass the socialist test and win a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front.

    向人民解放军学习  把反右派斗争贯彻到底
    中国民主同盟主席　沈钧儒
    每逢“八一”建军佳节，更加激起我们崇敬和爱戴中国人民解放军的心情。学习解放军的优良传统，学习解放军在共产党领导下，全心全意为人民服务的精神，是每一个追求进步的人的意愿。在今年，解放军建军三十周年纪念，又恰是全国人民向资产阶级右派分子进行反击，在政治上、思想上展开社会主义和资本主义两条道路的激烈斗争的时候，向解放军学习，其意义就更为重大了。
    向解放军学什么？中国人民解放军是中国共产党、毛泽东主席所创造、组织起来的；在不断教育和训练下，而成长的一支人民的武装。不但有优良的军事传统，更重要的是有优良的政治传统。毛主席说：一个人若是“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。中国共产党在建军的时候，由红军时代起，首先给解放军一个伟大的灵魂。这个伟大的灵魂，使得解放军具有了全心全意为人民服务，不怕困难，不怕牺牲的精神。这是为了解放全人类而不惜自我牺牲的、伟大的共产主义者的心怀。努力学习这种精神，对于我们民盟的盟员来说，是极为重要的事。
    我们中国民主同盟的盟员，都是从旧社会里生长，并且受资产阶级教育的知识分子。从阶级成分上来看，绝大多数又是出身于资产阶级或是小资产阶级的家庭。虽然其中有不少的人，在资产阶级民主革命运动中，参加了革命；大多数人在解放后表示赞成社会主义制度；还有不少人努力学习马克思主义，真心诚意地进行自我改造，在思想上有了不同程度的进步，但是，盟员中大多数的人仍然保留或多或少的资产阶级思想，政治上处于中间状态；还有相当数目的人，充满着资产阶级思想，反对共产党和社会主义，在政治上是资产阶级的右派。这些右派分子，在兴风作浪。从最近全国人民所揭发的事实说明，右派分子已经把民盟的一部分组织，拉向后退，走上了资产阶级的道路。不少盟员迷失了政治方向，在不同程度上，跟着他们走。现在由于章罗联盟和其他右派分子反共反社会主义的阴谋败露，全国人民对于资产阶级右派分子的猖狂进攻进行了反击，我们民盟和各民主党派由模糊的状态中惊醒过来，了解到右派分子反共反人民反社会主义的毒害；了解到作为一个知识分子，作为一个民盟盟员，首先要在政治上站稳立场，和右派分子划清界线，不然就会堕落蜕化成为人民的敌人。
    但是有了这样的认识，还是不够的。要能坚决地站稳政治立场，就必须在深入的反右派斗争中，在今后正常的整风中，在日常的自我改造工作中，真正地改造自己的立场，真心诚意地接受马克思主义，接受共产党的领导，使自己具有正确的世界观。这样的人，才是真正有了“灵魂”，有了为人民服务的心怀。
    如何改造自己。除了学习马克思主义，更重要的是要同工农兵打成一片，向工农兵学习，这是共产党、毛主席一再教导我们的。工人是我们的老师，解放军是我们的老师。所以，在纪念建军三十周年的时候，我们民盟盟员应当立下宏愿，向解放军学习，而在目前，特别是学习人民解放军的无比英勇的坚决不移的战斗精神，把反资产阶级右派的斗争贯彻到底。一切知识分子都要抱定决心，过社会主义这一关，并且在政治思想战线上，取得社会主义革命的伟大胜利。
