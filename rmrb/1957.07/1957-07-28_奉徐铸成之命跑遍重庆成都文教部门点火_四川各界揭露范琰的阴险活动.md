    On Xu Zhucheng's Orders, Running All Over Chongqing and Chengdu's Cultural and Educational Departments to Start Fires
    All Circles in Sichuan Expose Fan Yan's Insidious Activities

    (By our newspaper's dispatch) Recently, people from all walks of life in Sichuan Province have continuously exposed in newspapers and at forums the fact that Fan Yan, a reporter for Wenhui Daily and a rightist, has been setting fires everywhere, carrying out anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy activities.

    Fan Yan (Huan Bangxian, member of the China Democratic League), since arriving in Sichuan in April this year on the orders of Xu Zhucheng, the rightist director and editor-in-chief of Wenhui Daily, has traveled all over the cultural and educational departments of Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places, using the "activity funds" Wenhui Daily gave him to invite people to dinner, watch plays, and win over his so-called "masses."

    In his interviewing activities, Fan Yan went everywhere looking for people to write articles "complaining of grievances" and "seeking redress," looking for people to provide "typical" "negative materials." He once said to people that any manuscripts involving criticism of the Party committee should be published.

    The "Interview with Liu Shahe on 'Grass and Trees'" was a "masterpiece" of Fan Yan's anti-Party activities. Before entering Sichuan, he had deliberately challenged the Party and the people on the "Grass and Trees" issue. When interviewing the rightist Liu Shahe, Fan Yan's attitude was unusually active, saying that Shanghai was paying close attention to the incident of the crude criticism of "Grass and Trees," asking Liu Shahe to speak freely, and inciting him by saying: "You don't have to be afraid, we will be responsible if problems arise." After this interview was written, he sent it out in a hurry, regardless of others' advice to carefully verify the facts. After the manuscript was published, he wrote a letter to another Wenhui Daily reporter saying, "Setting a fire is indeed a great pleasure." Soon after, Liu Shahe shook hands with Fan Yan to thank him.

    During Fan Yan's interviews in Sichuan, Xu Zhucheng often called him to give instructions, saying things like "You have made a contribution, and I thank you on behalf of Wenhui Daily." After "Liu Shahe on 'Grass and Trees'" was published, Xu Zhucheng called again to praise him.

### 奉徐铸成之命跑遍重庆成都文教部门点火  四川各界揭露范琰的阴险活动

    奉徐铸成之命跑遍重庆成都文教部门点火
    四川各界揭露范琰的阴险活动
    本报讯　四川省各界人士最近在报刊和座谈会上，连续揭露了文汇报记者、右派分子范琰到处放火，进行反党、反社会主义阴谋活动的事实。
    范琰（宦邦显、民盟盟员）自今年4月奉文汇报社长兼总编辑右派分子徐铸成之命到四川后，跑遍成都、重庆等地文教部门，用文汇报给他的“活动费”请人吃饭、看戏，拉拢他所谓的“群众”。
    范琰在采访活动中，到处找人写“诉苦”“申冤”的文章，找人提供“典型”的“反面材料”。他曾向人说，凡涉及到批评党委的稿子，都要发。
    “流沙河谈‘草木篇’”这篇访问记，是范琰反党活动中的一篇“杰作”。他在入川前就蓄意在“草木篇”问题上，向党和人民挑战。在访问右派分子流沙河时，范琰的态度异常积极，说是上海方面很注意粗暴批评“草木篇”的事件，请流沙河畅谈，并煽动说：“你不用怕，出了问题，由我们负责。”这篇访问记写成后，他不管别人劝他慎重核对事实的劝告即匆匆寄出。稿件刊出后，他写信给文汇报另一记者说：“放了一把火毕竟是一大快事。”不久，流沙河即向范琰握手致谢。
    范琰在四川采访过程中，徐铸成经常打电话给他指示。并说什么“你有功，我代表文汇报感谢你。”“流沙河谈‘草木篇’”发表后，徐铸成又打电话表扬他。
