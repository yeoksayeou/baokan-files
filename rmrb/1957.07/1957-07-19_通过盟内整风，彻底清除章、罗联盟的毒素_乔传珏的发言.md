I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and other reports.

During the meeting, with immense gratitude, we celebrated a great festival—the 36th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. We sincerely thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It was the Communist Party that led the people of the whole country to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries, completed the bourgeois democratic revolution, rescued the people of the whole country from dire straits, and in a short period of time, led the people of the whole country to achieve the basic victory of the socialist revolution and the major achievements of socialist construction. Our country has only been established for eight years, and in politics, it has built a unified and rock-solid people's democratic dictatorship. In the economy, it has greatly exceeded the pre-liberation level of backward agricultural production, and has rapidly established and developed its own heavy and light industries almost from ruins, becoming one of the countries with the fastest industrial development in the world. In culture and education, it has greatly changed the ignorance and backwardness historically left to our people, and is actively moving towards the international advanced level. These ironclad facts are not only personally felt by the people of the whole country, but also recognized by our enemies who hate us. All this is the result of the wise leadership of the Communist Party, the result of the people's democratic dictatorship, that is, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it also eloquently proves the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. Therefore, it is natural and reasonable for the people to love the Communist Party. Since the liberation of Lushun-Dalian, I have been working in one place for eleven years. I have personally seen how the Party led the people of the whole city to carry out social democratic reforms and rapidly restored and developed production on the ruins of the colonial economy; when the country entered the period of planned construction, how the Party led the people of the whole city to develop the socialist economy and culture to support national construction and systematically carried out socialist transformation. I also deeply appreciate how the Soviet army united and cooperated with the Chinese people during its stationing in Lushun-Dalian, and vigilantly defended the peace in the Far East with heroic and selfless spirit; and how the Soviet experts displayed a high degree of internationalism in the restoration and development of the national economy in our city, and gave us sincere and selfless help. Therefore, any absurd remarks made by bourgeois rightists to distort the truth, confuse right and wrong, and attempt to obliterate the great achievements of the Party and the state in various fields, and attempt to undermine Sino-Soviet friendship are absolutely untenable. We must resolutely refute them.

The Rightists Want to Lead the Entire China Democratic League to a Dead End

I am one of the responsible persons of the local organizations of the China Democratic League in Liaoning Province and Lushun-Dalian City. I express my boundless indignation at the right-wing careerists such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, who occupy the leading positions in the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, and their anti-communist groups. On behalf of myself and the vast majority of members of the China Democratic League in Liaoning Province, I accuse them of their shameless criminal activities against the Communist Party and against socialism. We know that the China Democratic League followed a middle-of-the-road line from its establishment in 1941 until its headquarters was forced to dissolve in 1947, but at the Third Plenary Session of the China Democratic League held in Hong Kong in 1948, it liquidated the middle-of-the-road line and decided to "lean to one side," that is, to lean to the side of the people and cooperate closely with the Communist Party. The subsequent League Charter stipulated that it would accept the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party and take the socialist road. The National League Members Congress last year also determined the general policy of "everything for socialism." All of this is in line with the interests of the country and the wishes of the vast majority of League members. However, we did not expect that this small group of right-wing careerists would be hypocritical and frantically play the tricks of double-dealers, using the legal status within the League to secretly engage in illegal and criminal activities. The facts revealed in the anti-rightist struggle in the past few days prove that Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and others have still insisted on their middle-of-the-road line from 1948 to the present. On the surface, they pretended to accept socialist transformation and the leadership of the Communist Party, but secretly, for ten years, they have never stopped their anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracies. When the Communist Party began to rectify its work style and invited non-Party people to put forward criticisms and opinions, they thought the opportunity was not to be missed, so they advocated the establishment of a national power organ outside the National People's Congress—a "Political Design Institute"—to exclude the Communist Party's leadership over state affairs; they advocated the establishment of a "Rehabilitation Committee" to "seek redress" for counter-revolutionaries. When a gust of wind blew in the early June liberalization, they mistakenly estimated that "the Communist Party was on its way out," that they could show their cards to the Communist Party, and that they could come out to "clean up the mess" in order to usurp leadership and implement capitalist restoration. So they immediately extended their clutches to various places, especially to institutions of higher learning and intellectuals, plotting to abolish the school committee system; weakening the Party's leadership over scientific research, and doing their best to provoke relations between the Party and intellectuals, and frantically attacking the Party. Obviously, they are determined to lead the entire China Democratic League to the dead end of anti-Party and anti-socialism in order to satisfy their insatiable political ambitions. We solemnly tell them: your attempts to lead the China Democratic League astray are in vain. We will resolutely follow the Communist Party and resolutely take the socialist road. All parties are paying close attention to the National Working Conference of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League held in April this year is very necessary. Although that meeting was ostensibly to seek to improve the work of the China Democratic League under the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, it was actually used by Zhang and Luo to peddle their "private goods" and issue secret orders to their anti-communist group. What secret orders Zhang and Luo issued to the members of their anti-communist group during the meeting is unknown, but I and other comrades who attended the meeting did "learn" something about the "private goods" they peddled. For example, Zhang Bojun said at a forum for responsible persons of local organizations: since the 20th Congress of the CPSU, major changes have taken place in the international and domestic situation. We should re-study and evaluate China's democratic parties. With the changes in the domestic and international situation, the nature and tasks of the democratic parties will develop and change, and socialist democracy will also develop and change. It is still changing now. I didn't understand the true meaning of what he said at the time, but now I understand. The change in the democratic parties he talked about was to become equal to the Party or to have each party take turns in power; the change in socialist democracy he talked about was to change socialist democracy into capitalist democracy. This is obviously an anti-communist and anti-socialist fallacy. In his report on his visit to six countries during the National Working Conference, Zhang Bojun not only spread some revisionism, but also provoked and slandered the relations between socialist countries, especially the relations between other socialist countries and the Soviet Union. When Zhang Bojun talked about improving the leadership work of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League at the forum for responsible persons of local organizations, he said that the organization should be adjusted, and new political and legal committees, financial and economic committees, and cultural and educational committees should be established to conduct "investigation and research" on national policies. Most of the members of the China Democratic League are engaged in cultural, educational, and scientific and technological work. It is understandable to establish a cultural and educational committee, but they advocated the establishment of political and legal and financial and economic committees. I don't know what their intention is. Today, when we connect it with the "Political Design Institute" and the "Rehabilitation Committee" that they advocate establishing, it is not difficult to see that they have ulterior motives.

The Lushun-Dalian China Democratic League Organization Was Influenced by the Zhang-Luo Group

It should be admitted that the thinking of the middle-of-the-road line that the Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji group has consistently adhered to, although they did not dare to express it openly in the past period, has also seriously affected many local organizations consciously or unconsciously. Taking the Lushun-Dalian China Democratic League organization as an example, in the past year or so, due to the ideological influence of the Zhang-Luo group on the issue of intellectuals, the progressive side of the League members, the side that played a positive role in national construction, has been excessively exaggerated, while the negative side that needs to be transformed has been ignored, thus greatly relaxing ideological transformation work. We have united and accommodated the shortcomings and mistakes of some backward elements in the League without principle, and rarely carried out criticism and education. We often emphasize that the work of schools and scientific research institutions should adapt to the characteristics of intellectuals from the perspective of representing the legitimate interests of intellectuals, but rarely consider how to strengthen the ideological transformation of League members to meet the needs of national construction. Since the Party Central Committee put forward the principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision last year, we have often one-sidedly emphasized supervising the Party, while accepting the Party's leadership and supervision has been far from enough. In terms of developing the organization, under the ideological influence of the Zhang-Luo group's large-scale development, the development has been very rapid in the past year or so, and it has nearly doubled (more than 100 people) last year alone. After the National Working Conference of the China Democratic League this year, under the principle of combining development and consolidation, the organization continued to be vigorously developed, and it has long ignored the important condition of taking progressive elements as the backbone in the work of developing the organization, and has absorbed many middle and backward elements into the League. This actually helped the bourgeois rightists such as Zhang and Luo and served to expand their political capital.

I Also Made Some Mistakes

During the period of helping the Party rectify its work style, many absurd remarks appeared among the League members in Lushun-Dalian, which also shows that our ideological and political work was very weak in the past period. And I personally also made some mistakes during the liberalization period, especially in the early stage of the anti-rightist struggle. For example, at the forum of the United Front Work Department of the Municipal Party Committee, without analyzing the reactionary nature of the political propositions of the Zhang-Luo alliance, I rashly expressed my support for organizing an alliance of intellectuals. Although my motivation for making this suggestion was to reduce the trouble of several democratic parties intersecting in the development of organizations, and the party I mentioned was one that must accept the leadership of the Communist Party, thus fundamentally different from the reactionary party advocated by Ye Duyi for the purpose of being equal to or sharing the limelight with the Party, it also helped the bourgeois rightists to expand the influence of their reactionary political propositions among intellectuals to a certain extent. I also adopted an attitude of accommodation and catering to the League members' liberalization, with more encouragement than criticism. I once said that no matter what opinions and criticisms, as long as they start from caring for the Party and improving work, the China Democratic League organization will give its support, and if it is truly subjected to retaliation, the China Democratic League organization will definitely speak out for justice. I didn't expect that a few right-wing elements in the League would distort and use it as an excuse to attack the Party. For me, the most serious mistake was the lack of political sensitivity to the right-wing elements' attack on the Party and socialism, and the existence of a sentimental attitude towards the right-wing elements. In the early stage of liberalization, I not only did not see through the reactionary nature of the disguised and destructive remarks made by the Zhang-Luo alliance—the establishment of a "Political Design Institute" and a "Rehabilitation Committee"—but also failed to distinguish the nature of the erroneous remarks of some League members in this city (such as Wu Xiang, Yang Changkui, Qiao Shumin, etc.). I never dared to face the obviously erroneous and absurd remarks as anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks and conduct a resolute struggle. I thought that since the Party had long proposed "the speaker is not guilty, the listener should take warning," these erroneous remarks would naturally distinguish right from wrong after free debate, so why rush it. Soon, the workers and peasants spoke, and members of other democratic parties also began to criticize. Under the control of a right-leaning mood, I still condoned and was ambiguous, unable to resolutely draw a clear line with the right-wing elements; I hesitated and watched, unwilling to carry out a resolute struggle against them. For a period of time, it greatly hindered the development of the anti-rightist struggle of the Lushun-Dalian China Democratic League organization. Why did I do this? Now, when I examine it, it is mainly because I have not stood firm on the socialist position, and I lack an understanding of the anti-rightist struggle as a most serious and profound class struggle. I fear that I am acting too hastily and struggling against the wrong people, and even fear hurting the right-wing elements, while I am not so concerned about the right-wing elements hurting the Party and socialism. In the past few years, due to my relaxation of self-education and self-transformation in the past movements, coupled with poor political theory study and low political level, I swayed and fluctuated, and had many concerns when I encountered major issues of right and wrong, and could not stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and summon the courage to launch a resolute struggle against the right-wing elements. Through studying Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the various reports of the conference, as well as participating in discussions at the conference, I have a further understanding of my mistakes. I am determined to continue to deeply examine and strive to transform myself, resolutely draw a clear political and ideological line with the bourgeois right-wing elements, stand firm on the socialist position, and bravely throw myself into the hot struggle against the right-wing elements, overcome sentimentalism, and launch a relentless struggle against the bourgeois right-wing elements, so as to defend the Party and socialism together with the people of the whole country, and temper myself and improve myself in this fierce political and ideological battle. We will, through party rectification within the League, seriously examine the political and organizational lines of the Lushun-Dalian China Democratic League organization, thoroughly criticize and eliminate the reactionary ideological toxins of the Zhang-Luo alliance, and, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the leadership of the higher-level League organization, make the Lushun-Dalian China Democratic League organization move forward along the correct path.

### 通过盟内整风，彻底清除章、罗联盟的毒素  乔传珏的发言

    通过盟内整风，彻底清除章、罗联盟的毒素
    乔传珏的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和其他各项报告。
    我们在会议的期间里，怀着万分感激的心情，庆祝了一个伟大的节日——中国共产党诞生三十六周年纪念日。我们诚心诚意地感谢共产党和毛主席。因为是共产党领导全国人民打倒了国民党反动派，完成了资产阶级民主革命，拯救全国人民于水深火热之中，并且又在短短的时期内，领导全国人民取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利和社会主义建设的重大成就。我们国家建国以来仅仅八年，在政治上已经建成了全国统一的、稳如泰山的人民民主专政的政权。在经济上已经使落后的农业生产大大超过了解放前的水平，并且几乎是在废墟上迅速建立和发展了自己的重工业和轻工业，而成为全世界工业发展最快的一个国家。在文化教育上已经大大地改变了历史上所遗留给我国人民的愚昧和落后的状态，正朝着国际的先进水平积极地前进着。这些铁的事实，不仅为全国人民所亲身感受，同时也为仇视我们的敌人所共认。所有这一切，都是共产党的英明领导的结果，都是人民民主专政即无产阶级专政的结果，也雄辩地证明了社会主义制度具有无可比拟的优越性，所以，人民热爱共产党，这是天经地义和情理之自然的。我从旅大解放以来，一直在一个地方工作十一年。我亲眼看到党是怎样领导全市人民进行了社会民主改革，并在殖民地经济的废墟上迅速恢复和发展了生产；当国家进入有计划的建设时期，党又怎样领导全市人民发展社会主义经济和文化，以支援国家建设并有步骤地进行了社会主义改造。我也深切地体会到苏联军队在驻旅大期间怎样同中国人民团结合作，以英勇忘我的精神，警惕地保卫了远东和平；苏联专家在我市恢复和发展国民经济中，怎样发挥高度的国际主义精神，给予我们真诚无私的帮助。因此资产阶级右派分子颠倒是非，混淆黑白，企图抹煞党和国家在各方面的伟大成就，企图破坏中苏友谊而发出的任何荒谬言论，都是绝对站不住脚的。我们必须坚决予以驳斥。
    右派分子要把整个民盟带进绝路
    我是辽宁省和旅大市民盟地方组织负责人之一。我对于盘踞民盟中央领导地位的章伯钧、罗隆基等右派野心家和他们的反共集团，表示无比的愤慨。我代表个人和辽宁省绝大多数盟员控诉他们反对共产党、反对社会主义的无耻的罪恶活动。我们知道，民盟从一九四一年成立时起到一九四七年总部被迫解散时止是走着中间路线的，但是到了一九四八年在香港召开民盟三中全会就清算了中间路线，决定了“一边倒”即倒向人民这一边，与共产党密切合作。在后来的盟章里规定了接受工人阶级和共产党的领导，走社会主义的道路。去年全国盟员代表大会并确定了“一切为了社会主义”的总方针。所有这些都是符合于国家利益的，也符合于绝大多数盟员的愿望的。但是我们没有想到这一小撮右派野心家竟口是心非，丧心病狂地玩弄两面派的手法，利用盟内的合法地位，偷偷摸摸干着非法的罪恶勾当。根据这几天反右派斗争中所揭发的事实证明章伯钧、罗隆基从一九四八年到现在仍然还是坚持着他们的中间路线，表面上伪装着接受社会主义改造，接受共产党领导，暗中却十年如一日地始终没有停止过反共、反社会主义的阴谋活动。当共产党开始整风并邀请党外人士提出批评和意见的时候，他们以为时机不可失，于是就主张在全国人民代表大会之外，另成立一个国家权力机关——“政治设计院”以排斥共产党对国家事务的领导；主张成立“平反委员会”来替反革命分子“伸冤雪恨”。在六月初旬鸣放中刮起一股歪风的时候，他们错误地估计“共产党大势已去”，他们可以和共产党摊牌，由他们出来“收拾残局”，以便篡夺领导权，实行资本主义复辟。于是顿时向各地，特别是高等院校和知识分子中间，伸出他们的魔爪，阴谋取消学校党委制；削弱党对于科学研究工作的领导，竭力挑拨党与知识分子的关系，疯狂向党进攻。很显然，他们是决心把整个民盟带进反党、反社会主义的绝路上去，以满足他们贪得无厌的政治野心。我们严正地告诉他们：你们想把民盟带入歧途是枉费心机的。我们坚决跟着共产党走，坚决走社会主义道路。各方面人士都密切注意今年四月民盟中央召开的全国工作会议是十分必要的。那次会议虽然表面上是为了在长期共存、互相监督的方针下，谋求改进民盟的工作，但实际上却被章、罗利用，来贩卖他们的“私货”，向他们的反共集团发布密令。章、罗在会议期间向他们的反共集团的成员，究竟发布了那些密令，不得而知，但他们贩卖的“私货”，我同其他与会同志一样却“领教”了一些。如章伯钧在一次地方组织负责人座谈会上说：从苏共第二十次代表大会以后，国际国内形势已发生了重大变化，我们应该对中国的民主党派，重新进行研究和估价，随着国内外形势的变化，民主党派的性质、任务将要发展和变化，社会主义民主也将发展变化。现在正在继续变化。我当时不了解他讲的真实意义，现在明白了。他讲的民主党派的变化，就是要变成同党分庭抗礼或各党派轮流执政；他讲的社会主义民主的变化，就是要变社会主义民主为资本主义民主。这显然是一种反共反社会主义的谬论。章伯钧在全国工作会议期间所作的访问六国的报告中，除了撒布一些修正主义而外，并对社会主义各国之间的关系，特别是别的社会主义国家同苏联的关系，进行了挑拨和中伤。章伯钧在地方组织负责人座谈会上，谈到改进民盟中央领导工作时，说要调整机构，新成立政法委员会、财经委员会和文教委员会等，专门对国家政策进行“调查研究”工作。民盟的成员大部分是从事文教和科学技术工作的，成立文教委员会还可以理解，而他们却主张成立政法、财经委员会，不知其用意何在。今天同他们主张成立的“政治设计院”和“平反委员会”联系起来一看，就不难看出：他们是别有用心的了。
    旅大民盟组织受了章、罗集团的影响
    应该承认章伯钧、罗隆基集团一贯坚持着的中间路线的思想，在过去一个时期虽然未敢明目张胆地表露出来，但也早使许多地方组织自觉地或不自觉地受到了严重的影响。以旅大市民盟组织来说，近一年多以来，由于在知识分子问题上，受到章、罗集团一定的思想影响，过分夸大了盟员的进步的一面，对国家建设起积极作用一面的，而忽视了需要改造的消极的一面，因而大大放松了思想改造工作。对盟内某些后进分子的缺点和错误无原则的团结、迁就，很少进行批评、教育。我们往往从代表知识分子的正当利益出发，强调学校和科学研究机关的工作要适应知识分子特点，而很少考虑如何加强盟员的思想改造工作，以适应国家建设的需要。从去年党中央提出长期共存、互相监督的方针以后，我们往往片面地强调对党实行监督，而接受党的领导和监督则非常不够。在发展组织上，在章、罗集团大发展的思想影响下，一年多以来发展很快，去年一年就发展了近一倍（100余名）。今年民盟全国工作会议以后，在发展与巩固相结合的方针下，仍继续大力发展组织，而且很早就忽视了发展组织工作中以进步分子为骨干这一重要条件，吸收了不少中间、落后分子入盟。这实际上给章、罗等资产阶级右派分子帮了忙，为他们扩大政治资本服了务。
    我也犯了一些错误
    在帮助党整风时期，旅大盟员中间出现了许多荒谬言论，也正说明了过去一个时期，我们的思想政治工作是非常薄弱的。而我个人在鸣放时期，特别在反右派斗争的初期，也犯了一些错误。如在市委统战部座谈会上，对于章、罗联盟政治主张的反动的本质，不加以分析，就冒然表示赞同组织知识分子联盟。尽管我提这个意见的动机是为了减少几个民主党派在发展组织上交叉碰头的麻烦，并且我说的这个党派是必须接受共产党领导的，因而和叶笃义讲的以和党分庭抗礼或平分秋色为目的的反动党派根本不同，但也在一定程度上帮助了资产阶级右派分子在知识分子中扩大他们的反动的政治主张的影响。我对盟员鸣、放也采取了迁就、迎合的态度，鼓励有余，批判不足。我曾说过不管任何意见和批评，只要是从爱护党出发、从改进工作出发的，民盟组织都将给予支持，如果真正受到打击报复，民盟组织一定做到仗义执言。没有想到盟内少数右派分子却加以歪曲利用，作为他们攻击党的借口。对我说来最严重的错误还在于对右派分子向党、向社会主义进攻，缺乏政治敏感性和对于右派分子存有温情主义。在鸣、放初期，我不仅没有看穿章、罗联盟提出的伪装起来的破坏性的言论——成立“政治设计院”、“平反委员会”的反动的本质，而且对本市某些盟员（如吴襄、杨常骙、乔树民等）的错误言论的性质也没能辨别清楚。我对于显然是错误的荒谬的言论，总不肯以反党、反社会主义的言论，加以正视，并进行坚决的斗争。我心里想既然党早已提出“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，这些错误言论，将来经过自由辩论，自然就会明辨是非，何必操之过急。不久，工人、农民说话了，其他民主党派成员也开始批判了，我在一种右倾情绪的支配下，还是姑息暧昧，不能毅然同右派分子分清界限；徘徊观望，不愿意对他们进行坚决的斗争，在一个时期内大大妨碍了旅大民盟组织反右派斗争的开展，我为什么竟会这样呢？现在检查起来，主要还是因为没有站稳社会主义立场，对于反右派斗争是一场最严肃最深刻的阶级斗争缺乏认识，唯恐操之过急，斗错了人，甚至怕伤害右派分子，而对右派分子伤害党、伤害社会主义则显得不是那么关切。几年来由于自己在历次运动中放松了自我教育，自我改造，加上政治理论学习差，政治水平低，因而一遇大是大非的紧要关头，就摇摆动荡，顾虑重重，不能坚定立场，明辨是非，鼓起勇气，向右派分子展开坚决的斗争。通过学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告和大会各项报告以及参加大会、小会讨论，对自己的错误有了进一步的认识。我决心继续深入检查和努力改造自己，坚决同资产阶级右派分子认真划清政治和思想界线，站稳社会主义立场，勇敢地投入反右派的火热斗争中去，克服温情主义，和资产阶级右派分子展开毫不留情的斗争，来同全国人民一道保卫党、保卫社会主义，并在这一场激烈的政治、思想战斗中锻炼自己，提高自己。我们将通过盟内整风，认真检查旅大市民盟组织的政治路线和组织路线，彻底批判和清除章、罗联盟反动的思想毒素，在共产党的领导下，在上级盟组织的领导下，使旅大市民盟组织沿着正确的道路前进。
