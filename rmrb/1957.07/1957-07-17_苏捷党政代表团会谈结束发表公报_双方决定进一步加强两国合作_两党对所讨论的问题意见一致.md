(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency, the communiqué on the visit of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation to Czechoslovakia was signed at the Prague Palace at 10:00 AM on the 16th. On the Soviet side, the communiqué was signed by Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and on the Czechoslovak side by Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

The communiqué stated that during the talks, the two sides exchanged views on issues of mutual concern.

The representatives of both sides noted with satisfaction that since the signing of the Soviet-Czech Joint Declaration in January this year, relations between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life have continued to develop smoothly.

The solid foundation of these relations is the great friendship arising from the common interests of the two peoples, from the common ideas and goals of building socialism and striving for world peace, and from deep mutual trust and respect.

The communiqué pointed out that in recent months, important talks have been held on the coordination of industrial production and economic policies, as well as on scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries. Some specific agreements have been signed in the economic field. Talks on other agreements are progressing smoothly. The long-term trade agreement for 1958-60, which will be signed soon, will play a particularly important role.

Mutual visits by citizens of the two countries and exchanges of delegations of economic workers, social groups, scientists, and artists are expanding.

The communiqué stated that during the talks, the two delegations expressed completely identical views on the current development of the international situation. The communiqué said that the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia believe that the fundamental goal of all peace-loving people is to strive to ease international tensions, for universal disarmament and reduction of armed forces, for the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and for the immediate cessation of testing these weapons. The solution to this problem cannot be delayed any longer.

The communiqué stated that the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia fully believe that the basic principle of relations between the peoples of all countries should be peace, friendship, and mutual coexistence between all countries, regardless of their political and economic systems.

The communiqué continued that the talks between the representatives of the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia confirmed the complete agreement of the two parties on all issues discussed.

The representatives of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia informed the representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union about the efforts made by the CPCz recently to resolutely implement the decisions of the Party's National Congress and all the resolutions adopted after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. They also told the Soviet representatives about the important decisions made by the CPCz Central Committee at its two recent plenary sessions, which discussed the issue of greatly improving the efficiency of the Czechoslovak national economy and current issues in the party's ideological work.

The communiqué stated that the representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union affirmed and fully endorsed the measures taken by the CPCz Central Committee in the political, ideological, and economic fields.

The communiqué stated that the representatives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union informed the CPCz representatives about the most important measures taken by the CPSU to further develop Soviet industry and agriculture. They specifically explained the proceedings of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, at which the activities of the anti-Party group of Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov were discussed.

The communiqué stated that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and all CPCz members fully agree with these decisions. They resolutely condemn the anti-Party views and sectarian activities of the Malenkov, Kaganovich, and Molotov group, and believe that exposing this anti-Party group will help further strengthen the solidarity within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the purity of its Central Committee, and the struggle to successfully implement the party's general line determined by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 16th – According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, the Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, I.T. Grishin, held a reception in Prague on July 15th for the visit of the Soviet Party and Government Delegation to Czechoslovakia.

    双方的代表们满意地指出，自从今年1月签订了苏捷联合宣言以来，苏联和捷克斯洛伐克在政治、经济和文化生活的各个方面的关系都继续有顺利的发展。
    这些关系的坚固基础就是从两国人民的共同利益、从建设社会主义和争取世界和平的共同思想和目标、以及从深厚的互相信任和尊重中产生的伟大友谊。
    公报指出说，在最近几个月里，已经就两国的工业生产和经济政策的配合问题和科学与技术的合作问题举行了重要的会谈。在经济方面签订了一些具体协定。就其他一些协定举行的会谈正在顺利地进行。不久即将签订的1958—60年的长期贸易协定将起一种特别重要的作用。
    两国公民的互相访问、经济工作者、社会团体人员、科学家和艺术家代表团的相互往来正在扩大。
    公报说，在会谈过程中，两国代表团对目前国际局势的发展表现了完全一致的意见。公报说，苏联和捷克斯洛伐克认为，所有爱好和平人民的基本目标就是要为缓和国际紧张局势，为普遍裁减军备和武装部队，为无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器，为立刻停止试验这些武器而奋斗。这个问题的解决不能够再事拖延。
    公报说，苏联和捷克斯洛伐克完全相信，各国人民之间关系的基本原则应当是各国之间的和平、友谊和互相共处，而不管它们的政治和经济制度如何。

    公报说，捷共中央和捷共全体党员完全同意这些决定。他们坚决谴责马林科夫、卡冈诺维奇和莫洛托夫集团的反党意见和宗派活动，并且认为揭露这个反党集团将有助于进一步加强苏联共产党内部团结的事业，它的中央委员会的纯洁性、以及为顺利地执行苏联共产党第二十次代表大会确定的党的总路线的斗争。
