This newspaper's reporter from Hekou reported on the 28th: The southern section of the Bihe Railway has laid tracks to Majie, 28 kilometers from Hekou, today. Thus, including the northern section, a total of 85 kilometers of track have been laid on the 177-kilometer-long Bihe line. In mid-July, floods occurred in Vietnam, destroying the railway, and the transportation of steel rails will be suspended for about a month. During this period, the track-laying work on the Bihe line will also be suspended. Currently, all the bridge piers and abutments on the entire line have been completed, only a small portion of the steel beam riveting work remains, and the sleepers are also largely ready. As long as the steel rails continue to arrive, they can be laid in time.

The Bihe Railway has a narrow roadbed, sharp curves, high bridges, and numerous culverts. Coupled with inconvenient transportation, few villages along the way, and hot weather, the difficulties are rarely seen in railway construction across the country. However, the railway soldiers, maintaining the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army, seem even more energetic on such a line. At the beginning of the project, there was a time when vegetables could not be transported in, and the supply of grain was also insufficient. The soldiers would go to the mountains to pick some wild vegetables and cook some porridge, and they still worked just as hard. The Fifth Company, responsible for assembling the bridges, was mostly composed of novices. Coupled with the hot weather, after ten minutes in the sun, they would be as wet as if they had come out of the water. Those who were new to burning rivets had their faces swollen from the sun and heat. However, they still completed their task more than half a month ahead of schedule. The riveting work increased from more than ninety rivets per person per day at the beginning to more than two hundred and twenty rivets, with a maximum of three hundred and nineteen rivets, far exceeding the quota of one hundred and eighty rivets.

### 条件越困难　工作越有劲  碧河铁路铺轨已近一半

    条件越困难　工作越有劲
    碧河铁路铺轨已近一半
    本报河口28日电　碧河铁路南段已于今日铺轨到离河口二十八公里的马街，至此，连北段在内，全长一百七十七公里的碧河线已共铺轨八十五公里。本月中旬，越南发生洪水，冲毁铁路，钢轨的运输大约要停止一个多月。在这一段时间内，碧河线的铺轨工作也将停止。现在，全线的桥墩桥台都已完成，钢梁的拼铆工作只差一小部分了，枕木亦大体准备就绪，只要钢轨继续运来，就可及时铺上。
    碧河线路基窄、弯道急、桥梁高、涵洞多，加上交通不便，沿途村寨少，天气热，困难之多，在全国的铁路修建中都是少见的。但保持着解放军光荣传统的铁道兵，在这样的线路上反而显得更有劲。在工程刚开始时，曾有一度运不来菜，粮食也供应不上，战士们就到山上采些野菜，熬些粥，吃了一样的干活。负责拼装桥梁的五连，绝大部分是新手，加上天气热，太阳晒上十分钟，浑身就湿得像水里钻出来的一样。初烧铆钉的，日晒火烤，甚至把脸都烤肿了。但他们还是提前半个多月完成了任务，其中的钉铆工作，由开始时每天每支镑铆九十多个钉提高到二百二十多个钉，最高达到三百一十九个，远远的超过了一百八十个钉的定额。
