Not Complacent After a Bountiful Harvest
Hubei Launches a Production Increase Campaign

(Our dispatch) After a bountiful summer harvest in Hubei Province, the early rice harvest was also plentiful. The intermediate rice harvest is also expected to be plentiful, and the late rice and cotton crops are also growing well. The vast number of grassroots cadres and the masses are full of praise for this year's production. Some cooperatives are putting on operas to celebrate the harvest. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly reminded everyone to be wary of complacency and lethargy. According to inspections, there is an imbalance in production in various regions. Taking the Yichang area as an example: 50% to 60% of the crops are expected to increase production compared to last year, 30% of the crops can only maintain last year's production level, and 10% of the crops will be reduced compared to last year. To this end, the Provincial Committee instructed all regions to launch a mass production increase campaign to strive for an even greater harvest.

Currently, this campaign is developing and playing a significant role in promoting current production work. Xing Shan County (mountainous area) decided to weed the rice and corn crops one more time and apply fertilizer one more time than originally planned. In addition, according to the habits of the masses, 3 million mu of late autumn crops will be sown. These two measures can increase grain production by 5 million jin, which can exceed this year's production increase plan.

In order to overcome the difficulty of fertilizer shortages, various regions have adopted measures such as adjusting the low price of fertilizer, paying a portion of cash in advance for the purchase of members' fertilizer, and rationally arranging labor to launch a mass fertilizer accumulation campaign. In some areas, the fertilizer problem can almost be solved.

In order to strive for multiple plantings and harvests, various regions are restoring the planting of small miscellaneous grains that were squeezed out in the early days of cooperativization. Cooperatives hand over wasteland on abandoned dikes, hillsides, field edges, and beside houses to production teams or distribute them to individual members for use. Whoever plants it harvests it, and it is not counted as a unified purchase task. The Huanggang area estimates that this year's production of small miscellaneous grains can be increased by 80 million jin.

In addition, various regions are strengthening the leadership of about 10% of the backward cooperatives. A total of more than 1,200 government cadres from 26 counties including Echeng and Xishui have been sent to backward cooperatives to help with their work. Xiangyang and Yichang areas are launching large-scale drought resistance campaigns. Currently, some backward cooperatives have begun to change their production situation. (Gu Weijin)

    丰收不自满
    湖北开展增产突击运动
    本报讯　湖北省夏季丰收以后，早稻又告丰收，目前中稻又已丰收在望，晚稻和棉花等作物也长得好。广大基层干部和群众对于今年生产，一片叫好之声。有些合作社唱戏庆祝丰收。中共湖北省委及时提醒大家警惕自满麻痹思想。据检查，各地生产存在不平衡的现象。以宜昌专区为例：有50％到60％的作物可比去年增产，30％的作物只能保持去年的生产水平，10％的作物要比去年减产。为此，省委指示各地开展群众性的增产突击运动，争取更大丰收。
    目前这个运动正在发展，对于推动当前生产工作起了很大作用。兴山县（山区）决定将水稻和苞谷比原计划多薅一次草，多追一次肥。另外根据群众习惯，播种晚秋作物三百万亩。这两项措施可增产粮食五百万斤，可超额完成今年增产计划。
    各地为克服肥料困难，采取调整肥料的偏低价格、收购社员肥料预先付出一部分现金、合理安排劳力等办法，掀起群众性的积肥运动，有些地区肥料问题差不多可以解决了。
    为了争取多种多收，各地都在恢复种植合作化初期挤掉的小杂粮。合作社把废堤、山坡、田头、屋边的荒地交给生产队或分给社员个人使用，谁种谁收，不算统购任务。黄冈专区预计，今年可以增产小杂粮八千万斤。
    此外，各地正在加强约占10％的落后社的领导。鄂城、浠水等二十六个县共派出机关干部一千二百多名到落后社去帮助工作。襄阳和宜昌专区正在掀起大规模的抗旱运动。目前有些落后社开始改变生产状况。　（古维进）
