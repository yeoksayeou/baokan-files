    世界青年联欢节
    1，世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节是怎样一种活动？过去几次联欢节是在那里举行的？
    答：世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节是各国不同信仰、不同民族和种族的青年和学生和平友好的联欢节日。历届联欢节都是世界民主青年联盟组织的。联欢节的目的是促进各国青年的友谊合作与文化交流，动员广大青年为缓和国际紧张局势、争取持久和平而斗争。
    第一届联欢节是1947年7月20日至8月17日在捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格举行的。有七十一个国家的一万七千多名青年参加。
    第二届联欢节是1949年8月14日至28日在匈牙利首都布达佩斯举行的。有八十二个国家的一万多名青年参加。
    第三届联欢节是1951年8月5日至19日在柏林举行的。有一百零四个国家的二万六千名青年参加。
    第四届联欢节是1953年8月2日至16日在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特举行的。有一百一十一个国家的三万名青年参加。
    第五届联欢节是1955年7月31日至8月14日在波兰首都华沙举行的。有一百十四个国家的三万多名青年参加。
    2、本届联欢节的规模怎样？将有那些活动？
    答：本届（第六届）联欢节定于1957年7月28日到8月11日在莫斯科举行。将有一百四十个国家和地区的三万多名青年参加联欢活动。此外，苏联各地将有八万青年到莫斯科同各国青年客人共度佳节。这样大的规模在联欢节的历史上是空前的。
    本届联欢节的活动将是非常丰富多采的。联欢节的筹备委员会已经订出了联欢节的各项活动的节目，每天的活动有三百五十种到四百种之多，仅仅是活动节目就可编成一本六十多页厚的书。
    7月28日那天，参加联欢节的青年们将在中央列宁运动场举行开幕仪式。随着联欢节的开始，国际和平与友谊大会开幕，各国代表团将就和平与友谊这个题目进行广泛的讨论。根据参加联欢节的青年的各种不同宗教信仰，不同职业和不同的嗜好，将为他们组织多种多样的集会。
    学习各种不同学科的学生将分别举行讨论会，并听取著名学者的演讲。
    国际学生俱乐部将成为参加联欢节的学生的一个活动中心。这里将举行同苏联南极探险队队员的会见，放映电影、举行芭蕾舞晚会等。
    联欢节将是青年们尽情歌唱跳舞的节日，人们可以欣赏到各个国家的民间歌舞。
    联欢节期间，青年们将要举行集会来纪念对发展世界科学和文化有贡献的各国人士。
    从7月29日到8月11日举行的第三届国际青年友谊运动会是和联欢节同时举行的最重要的项目之一，它的规模将是体育运动历史上最大的一次。　（何德一）
