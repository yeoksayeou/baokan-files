    Torch Festival
    Sinan
    Today (June 25th of the Lunar Calendar) is the Torch Festival of the people of Yunnan.

    The origin of this Torch Festival has a beautiful and touching story.

    Around the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty, Yunnan was in an era of "Six Zhao" (Mengshe, Yuexi, Langqiong, Dengtan, Shilang, Mengshe) vying for power.

    Among the six Zhao, Mengshe Zhao (Nanzhao) had the strongest power and Zhao King Piluoge's ambition was also great, attempting day and night to swallow the other five Zhao and make himself the supreme ruler of Yunnan.

    Piluoge built a magnificent Songming Tower in the capital—Dali. It was entirely constructed of oily pine wood, decorated inside with various wild animal skins and brocades, and furnished with many rare and precious objects. Piluoge would drink and watch palace maids perform local dances here every day with his officials.

    June 25th of the Lunar Calendar was the annual ancestral worship ceremony of the Six Zhao. Piluoge had prepared a conspiracy in advance, summoning the five Zhao kings to a banquet at Songming Tower. Lady Shanshan, the wife of Dengtan Zhao King, knew that Piluoge had ill intentions and dissuaded her husband from going, but the Dengtan Zhao King dared not disobey the order and attended as scheduled. Before leaving, Lady Shanshan personally put an iron bracelet on her husband's arm.

    Late at night, on the towering Songming Tower, the lights were brilliant, shining like daylight, and the sound of elephant drums shook the wilderness. When the five Zhao kings were reveling in singing and dancing, Piluoge slipped downstairs under a pretext, beat the drum as a signal, and the ambushing soldiers immediately set fire to the tower. Instantly, flames engulfed the Songming Tower, and the fire soared into the sky. In an instant, the Songming Tower was reduced to ashes, and all five Zhao kings were burned to death.

    Afterward, Piluoge announced that the five Zhao kings were drunk and caused a fire, and ordered the wives of the five Zhao to come and collect the bodies.

    At that time, countless people were burned to death, and the corpses were piled up, making it impossible to distinguish them. Only Lady Shanshan found her husband's body based on the iron bracelet on his arm, and carried it back to Dengtan Zhao for burial. Her wisdom was sincerely praised by the people.

    Piluoge heard that Lady Shanshan was virtuous and beautiful, and sent an envoy to force her to marry him. Lady Shanshan sternly refused, which angered Piluoge, who immediately sent a large army to besiege Dengtan Zhao (in Dengchuan County).

    Lady Shanshan was not afraid in the face of the powerful enemy. She personally supervised the soldiers to defend the city.

    After more than three months of isolated and arduous fighting, the city ran out of food and reinforcements. Finally, Lady Shanshan put on gorgeous clothes, solemnly bound herself to a chair, and starved to death. Before her death, she said, "I am going to the heavens to appeal for my husband's grievances"……

    Since then, every year on the night of June 25th of the Lunar Calendar, the people of Yunnan light torches to mourn this staunch and unyielding Lady Shanshan. Torches and silver flowers can be seen everywhere in rural and urban areas, forming a sea of fire. Young people hold up torches, singing and dancing in the fields, welcoming a bumper harvest of crops.

    火把节
    思南
    今天（农历六月二十五日）是云南人民的火把节。
    这火把节的来源，有一段美丽、动人的故事。
    大约唐代开元年间，云南正是“六诏”（蒙隽、越析、浪穹、邆赕、施浪、蒙舍）割据的时代。
    六诏中，蒙舍诏（南诏）的势力最强、诏王皮罗阁的野心也很大，日夜企图吞灭其他的五诏，使自己成为云南的最高统治者。
    皮罗阁在都城——大理建造了一座气势雄峻的松明大楼。全部采用油质的松木结构，里面用各种猛兽皮和锦绣装饰，陈设了不少的珍奇玩物。皮罗阁每天就与臣僚们在此饮酒，观看宫女表演的土风舞。
    农历六月二十五日是六诏一年一度的祭祖大典，皮罗阁预先布置下一个阴谋，召集五诏王在松明楼宴会。邆赕诏王的妻子慈善夫人深知皮罗阁不怀好意，劝阻她的丈夫勿去，可是邆赕诏王不敢违命，如期赴会。临行时，慈善夫人亲手把一支铁钏套在丈夫臂上。
    深夜，高耸入云的松明楼上，灯烛辉煌，照耀如同白昼，象鼓声震动四野。当五诏王正尽情地狂欢歌舞的时候，皮罗阁借故溜下楼来，击鼓为号，埋伏的士兵立即举火焚楼，顿时烈焰笼罩了松明楼，火光冲天，刹那间，松明楼便化为灰烬，五诏王全被焚死。
    事后，皮罗阁宣布说五诏王酒醉失火，引起火灾，命令五诏夫人前来收尸。
    当时烧死的人不计其数，尸骸累累，无法辨别，只有慈善夫人根据臂上铁钏而寻到了丈夫的尸首，便载回邆赕诏安葬，她的智慧获得人民衷心的赞扬。
    皮罗阁听说慈善夫人贤能而又美丽，派使者强迫说亲，慈善夫人严词拒绝，把皮罗阁惹恼了，立刻调大军围攻邆赕诏（邓川县境）。
    慈善夫人在强大的敌人威胁面前，毫不畏怯，她亲自督率士兵坚守城池。
    经过三个多月的孤军苦战，城内粮尽援绝。最后慈善夫人穿上艳丽的服装，庄严地将自己缚在座椅上，绝食而死。临死时说：“我向苍天去伸雪丈夫的冤屈”……
    从此，每年农历六月二十五日的夜里，云南人民就点燃火把悼念这位坚贞不屈的慈善夫人，农村和城市里到处火树银花，蔚成一片火海。小伙子们高举着火把，在田野间载歌载舞，迎接庄稼的大丰收。
