    I am a representative of the workers' families, and I fully agree with Premier Zhou's and Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo's reports. Our workers' families will further encourage our relatives to exceed the first Five-Year Plan, and together with the workers, contribute even greater strength to the country's socialist construction and the people's better life.
    Now, newspapers have published some absurd remarks by bourgeois rightists. The rightists distort the facts and have ulterior motives. Our workers' families must wage a resolute struggle against these reactionary remarks.
    The rightists say: People's living standards have not improved. We say: Since liberation, the living standards of workers have greatly improved. Before liberation, we workers were treated as beasts of burden and slaves, working hard all year round. But we were often only half-fed, lived in dilapidated houses, and countless people died of starvation, freezing, and lack of money for medical treatment. We wore clothes patched upon patches. My father-in-law's single trousers were patched so many times that they weighed several pounds when he died. What about now? Not only can we eat our fill, but our living standards are gradually improving. Many workers live in buildings. In summer, they can wear printed cloth shirts, and in winter, they can wear woolen trousers. For example, in the seventh group of the fourth branch of our factory, out of 31 households, only a few had never gone hungry under the Kuomintang. After liberation, 23 households bought bicycles, eight bought sewing machines, 16 bought radios, and 22 bought watches. Can you say that our living standards have not improved?
    The rightists say: Now it is the "Party's world." We say: Now it is the era of the true people. What status did our workers' families have in society in the past? After liberation, the workers became the masters of the country, and even workers' family members like me can become national people's representatives. Sun Ruizhi, a worker's family member, became a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We are not Communist Party members, but we can personally participate in discussions of national affairs. Many of our workers' family members have also been elected as government committee members and people's representatives in provinces, cities, and districts. They are not Communist Party members either, but tens of millions of workers' family members across the country have already participated in grassroots government work. These facts fully demonstrate that the rightists' claim of the "Party's world" is a deliberate slander against our Party and a smear against the non-Party masses who are serving socialism.
    After liberation, our workers' families have not only improved their living standards and raised their political status, but also gained culture. Before liberation, we were almost all illiterate. Now, seven out of ten workers' family members in our factory have gone to school. In recent years, more than 400 have graduated from junior primary school, including 180 who have graduated from senior primary school. All of this has been brought to us by the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, there would be no happiness for us today. The rightists say they want to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party. We workers' families firmly disagree. We are of one heart and one mind with the Communist Party, resolutely support the Communist Party, and will always follow the Communist Party. While I am attending the meeting here, the family sisters in the factory have brought me several letters asking me to question the rightists, what exactly is their intention in publishing those fallacies.
    Although our living standards have improved now, we cannot say that there are no difficulties at all. However, our current difficulties are fundamentally different from the difficulties before liberation. The difficulties before liberation were the kind that made it impossible for us workers to live and threatened our lives, while today's difficulties are brought about by the rapid development of the country's socialist construction. This is the country's difficulty, and it is also our own difficulty. Because the country has a poor foundation and insufficient funds, it wants to build factories, open mines, and engage in construction, and it is impossible to raise our living standards very high and very quickly all at once. How should we treat these difficulties? Should we just sit and complain, waiting for the country to solve them? That won't work. The country is ours, and we have a responsibility to solve the difficulties together with the country, using our own strength to solve our own problems. At present, the country is implementing the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, and our families must first achieve diligence and thrift in managing the household. In our daily lives at home, we must live within our means, spend money in a planned way, save water, electricity, grain, and coal, and engage in some sideline production, which can not only solve the difficulties of our own family life and reduce the burden on the country, but also have surplus money to deposit in the bank to help the country's construction. For example, the four family committees of our factory originally had 12 households in need of state relief. Since the families did a good job of careful calculation and planned living, these 12 households no longer needed state relief in the second half of 1956. Seventy percent of the families in our factory have savings in the bank. One branch with about 300 households saved more than 2,400 kilograms of grain for the country in the first half of 1957 because of their diligence and thrift in managing the household.
    Our factory built more than 20,000 square meters of houses for the workers last year. In the old society, who cared whether our workers' families had a place to live? They didn't even let our families enter the factory gate. But now, even though so many houses have been built, they are not enough to live in. This is mainly because many of our workers have gotten married and had children after liberation, so the factory's construction of houses cannot keep up with the needs of the families. We should save money and find our own ways to solve this problem. Last year, the workers in our factory built houses with public assistance. At that time, there were no bricks, so thousands of our family members dug and picked bricks themselves, contributing 280,000 bricks, and smoothly built more than 100 houses. In the future, we can also mobilize family members who live close to the factory not to move into the workers' dormitories, but we hope that the government can give employees who do not have housing and whose families are in other places a certain amount of vacation every year so that they can go home to see their families, or set up guest houses in the factory so that their families can come and stay for a few days a year. In addition, we must also promote birth control and advise employees and their families to have children in a planned way, so that the housing will not be so tight.
    Furthermore, the occasional insufficient supply of vegetables and pork is also due to the increase in our country's population and the improvement of people's living standards. In the past, we only bought meat once during the New Year and holidays. Now, we generally eat it once or twice a week. With more people eating meat, and production not increasing so quickly, of course there will be a shortage. We can also solve this problem ourselves. Our workers' families are all capable of working. If we grow some vegetables in front of and behind our houses, it will not only be enough for our own families to eat, but some can also be sold, which will not only supply the market but also subsidize family life. For example, 29 households in our second branch harvested more than 2,800 kilograms of green vegetables in 1956. This year, our factory families planted 100,000 eggplant and chili plants. If we assume that each plant yields one kilogram, we can roughly harvest 100,000 kilograms. Our factory is in the suburbs and has the conditions. We have already raised more than 200 fat pigs to supplement the supply of pork in the market. This year, we plan to raise 500 pigs.
    The problems of childcare and schooling are not unsolvable either. Now, many factory and mining units have organized nurseries and kindergartens for their workers' families. The families in our factory have set up 73 of them, accommodating more than 1,680 children. At this national conference of workers' family representatives, I heard that the families of the Nankou Railway Factory have organized remedial classes for out-of-school children, which has solved the problem of unemployment for primary school graduates. I believe we can also solve this problem.
    We workers' families know that the workers bear a very important responsibility in socialist construction, and we have thought of many ways and done a lot of work to enable our relatives to concentrate on production. For example, we know that every minute and every second is very precious during workers' production time. However, most of the workers' families are small families, and if something happens at home, the workers need to ask for leave to take care of it. In order to prevent the workers from delaying production due to family matters, our families have organized mutual assistance. For example, the eldest child of Wang Haixiang, an employee of our factory, was sick, and his wife took the eldest child to the hospital, leaving a one-year-old child at home. Wang Haixiang would have had to ask for leave to take care of the child. Later, the family members of the group took turns to take care of the child for him and cooked for him every day. They helped him for two weeks until his wife was discharged from the hospital. Wang Haixiang did not miss a single shift. It has now become a habit for our workers' families to help each other in the group to solve the difficulties of childbirth, illness, marriage, and funerals when there is no one to take care of them. In 1956, we provided mutual assistance to families with childbirth and illness 2,123 times, for a total of 4,582 days.
    Although our workers' families have done some work, there are still some problems that require support and solutions from all parties. During my inspection in Anshan this time, I found that some family activists have many tasks, many meetings, and a heavy burden. For example, Wang Xiulan, a family member of the Anshan Refractory Factory, holds 13 positions concurrently. The district people's committee, the street office, the police station, the trade union, the court, the health bureau, the epidemic prevention station, the bank, the department store, the insurance company...etc., all directly assign work to her. Meng Shuqing, director of the family committee of the Anshan Ore Dressing Plant, held 54 meetings in 23 days in September 1956, and Jin Xilan, the deputy director, held 63 meetings in 30 days. The family activists are so busy that they can't eat, can't work, and have no time to study or go deep into the masses. In particular, street offices often hold meetings without considering the family's cooking time, so that employees cannot eat when they return home. This is a problem that exists universally in cities across the country, seriously affecting the development of our family mass work, and we urgently hope that the local party committees, people's governments, trade unions, and women's federations will provide a quick solution.

    现在是真正人民的天下  非党群众不容右派诬蔑
    高凤琴的发言
    我是一个职工家属代表，我完全同意周总理和李先念、薄一波两位副总理的报告。我们职工家属将进一步鼓励自己的亲人超额完成第一个五年计划，要和职工共同为国家的社会主义建设，为人民更美好的生活贡献出更大的力量。
    现在报纸上发表了一些资产阶级右派的荒谬言论，右派分子歪曲事实，别有用心，我们职工家属要和这些反动言论作坚决的斗争。
    右派分子说：人民生活没有提高。我们说，解放以来，工人的生活是大大提高了。解放前，我们工人给人当牛马，做奴隶，一年忙到头。可是我们常常是吃的半饱半饥，住的是破房子，饿死、冻死、生病没钱医的数不清，穿的是补钉罗补钉，我公公临死时，一条单裤补成好几斤重。现在呢，不但能吃饱了，生活还逐步改善了。很多工人住上楼房了，夏天能穿上花布衫，冬天能穿上呢子裤了。比如我们厂四分会第七小组三十一户，在国民党时只有几户没挨过饿，解放后买自行车的就有二十三户，另买缝纫机八台，收音机十六台，手表二十二个。这能说我们的生活没有提高吗？
    右派分子说：现在是“党天下”。我们说：现在是真正人民的天下。过去我们工人家属在社会上有什么地位？解放了，工人当了国家的主人，就连我这样的职工家属也能当上全国人民代表。职工家属孙瑞芝当上了全国政协的委员。我们都不是共产党员，都能来亲身参加讨论国家大事。我们还有许多职工家属被选为省、市、区的政府委员、人民代表，她们也不是共产党员，但全国有几千万职工家属群众已经参加了基层政权工作。这些事实完全说明右派分子说“党天下”是有意的毁谤我们的党和诬蔑正在为社会主义服务的非党群众。
    解放后，我们职工家属不仅生活改善了，政治地位提高了，而且有了文化。解放前，我们几乎全是文盲，现在我厂职工家属十个人当中就有七个人上了学。几年来初小毕业的有四百多人，其中包括高小毕业的有一百八十人。这些都是共产党给我们带来的。没有共产党就没有我们今天的幸福。右派分子说要取消共产党的领导，我们职工家属是坚决不能同意的。我们和共产党一条心一条命，坚决拥护共产党，永远跟着共产党走。我在这里开会，厂里的家属姐妹给我带来好几封信，要我去质问右派分子，发表那些谬论究竟安的什么心。
    现在我们的生活虽然提高了，但是不能说没有任何困难了。不过我们现在的困难跟解放前的困难是根本不相同的。解放前的困难是叫我们工人活不下去要命的困难，而今天的困难是祖国社会主义建设迅速发展带来的困难。这是国家的困难，也是我们自己的困难。国家因为底子穷，资金不足，要盖工厂，开矿山，搞建设，不可能一下子把我们的生活提得很高、很快。我们怎样来对待这些困难呢？难道就坐着嚷嚷、埋怨，等着国家来解决吗？那是不行的。国家是我们的，我们有责任和国家共同来解决困难。用我们自己的力量解决自己的问题。目前国家贯彻勤俭建国的精神，我们家属首先要做到勤俭持家，我们在家过日子要做到量入为出，有计划的开支，节约水、电、粮、煤，搞些副业生产，不仅解决自己家庭生活的困难，减轻国家负担，还可以有余钱存入银行帮助国家建设。比如，我们厂四个家属委员会分会原来有十二户需要国家救济，自从家属做到精打细算，有计划地过日子后，一九五六年下半年这十二户都不需要国家救济了。我们厂百分之七十的家属在银行有了储蓄，有一个分会三百来户，因为勤俭持家，一九五七年上半年为国家节约粮食二千四百多斤。
    我们厂去年为工人盖了二万多平方公尺房子。在旧社会谁管我们工人家属有没有房子住，就连厂子门也不让我们家属进。可是现在盖那么多房子还不够住，这主要是我们工人解放后结婚的多，孩子生得多，所以工厂盖房子总跟不上家属们的需要。我们应该积蓄，自己想办法解决，去年我们厂的工人自建公助盖房子，当时没有砖，我们几千个家属自己动手挖砖、拣砖，供献砖二十八万块，就顺利地盖了一百多间房子。今后我们还可以动员住离厂近的家属不搬到工房来住，不过希望政府能够给没有房子而家在外地的职工每年有一定的假期，让他们能够回家看看家属，或者在厂里设招待所，让他们的家属一年能来住些日子。另外，我们还要宣传节育，劝职工和家属有计划的生孩子，那么，房子也就不会那么紧张了。
    再说，蔬菜、猪肉有时供应不足，这也是我们国家人口增多，人民生活提高的缘故。过去我们过年过节才买一回肉，现在一般的一星期都要吃一两回，吃肉的人多了，生产提高没那么快，当然就要不够。这问题我们自己也是可以解决的。我们职工家属都是能劳动的，在房前房后自己种些菜，不但够自己家吃，有的还可以卖出一部分，既供应了市场，又补贴了家庭生活。比方我们二分会二十九户，一九五六年就收获青菜二千八百多斤。今年我们厂家属种了十万棵茄子和辣椒，一棵就打算出一斤吧，大致就能收十万来斤。我们厂在郊区，有条件，我们已养了二百多头肥猪，补助市场上猪肉的供应，今年我们计划养五百头猪。
    孩子寄托和升学问题也不是没法解决的。现在许多厂矿单位的职工家属都组织了托儿站、幼儿园，我们厂家属就办了七十三个，共收托孩子一千六百八十多名。在这次全国职工家属代表会议上，我听见铁路南口工厂家属举办失学儿童补习班，解决了小学毕业生的失学问题，我相信我们也是可以解决的。
    我们工人家属知道工人在社会主义建设中，担负的责任非常重大，想了许多办法，做了许多工作来使自己的亲人一心一意的搞好生产。比如，我们知道工人在生产时间一分钟一秒钟都是非常宝贵的。可是职工的家庭差不多都是小家庭，家里有点事，就需要职工请假在家照顾。我们家属为了不让职工因家里的事耽误生产，组织了互助。比如我厂职工王海祥的大孩子有病，他老婆带大孩子住院，家里扔下一个一岁的小孩子，本来王海祥就得请假在家照顾，后来小组的家属轮流给他带那小孩，每天还给他做饭，共互助了两个星期，直等他老婆出院，王海祥一个班也没脱。我们职工家属现在在小组里互相帮助解决生育、疾病、婚丧等没有人照顾的困难已经成了习惯。一九五六年我们互助生孩子、生病的家属二千一百二十三人次，共四千五百八十二天。
    我们职工家属虽然做了一些工作，但是还有一些问题，需要各方面给予我们支持解决。我这次到鞍山视察，发现有些家属积极分子任务多、会议多，负担很重。像鞍山耐火厂家属王秀兰，身兼十三职，区人民委员会、街道办事处、派出所、工会、法院、卫生局、防疫站、银行、百货公司、保险公司……等等，都直接向她布置工作。鞍山选矿厂家属委员会主任孟淑清，一九五六年九月在二十三天中开了五十四次会，副主任金喜兰在三十天中开了六十三次会。家属积极分子忙得饭也吃不上，活也做不上，学习、深入群众都没时间。特别是街道办事处开会往往不照顾家属做饭时间，以致职工回家吃不到饭。这是一个在全国各城市普遍存在的问题，严重地影响着我们家属群众工作的开展，迫切希望各地党委、人民政府、工会和妇联给予迅速解决。
