Xinhua News Agency, July 6th: People's representatives continued their general discussions at the Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress this afternoon.

Today, the representatives who spoke at the meeting included Xu Chongqing, Chen Qiyou, Mao Henian, Wang Shiming, Zhou Gucheng, Rong Yiren, Yang Ding'an, Wu Han, Sun Zuobin, Chen Rutang, Gao Zhenwu, Li Fangyao, Wu Tongming, Lu Zhenfan, and Gong Tianmin. Representatives Ma Xulun, Deng Guozhang, Ye Shengtao, Deng Wenzhao, and An Wenqin submitted written speeches, totaling twenty people. They used concrete facts to illustrate the tremendous achievements our country has made in socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past few years and offered criticisms and suggestions regarding shortcomings and problems in our work. Many representatives continued to sternly refute the anti-socialist and reactionary words and deeds of the bourgeois rightists.

Today's executive chairmen of the meeting were: Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Wu Yuzhang, Deng Yingchao, Ma Mingfang, Zhao Maochen, Zhao Zhongyao, Chen Wangdao, and Dao Jingban.

Today's meeting started at 3:00 PM and ended at 7:00 PM.

Tomorrow, Sunday, will be a day of recess.

Xinhua News Agency, July 6th: Many delegation groups at the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress continued to expose and criticize the reactionary words and deeds of bourgeois rightists this morning. In recent days, many delegation groups have also discussed the work of various government departments and offered criticisms and suggestions.

The Yunnan delegation group held meetings last night and this morning to further expose and criticize Long Yun's reactionary words and deeds.

Under the repeated urging of the representatives, Long Yun read his written "ideological self-criticism" at the group meeting last night. However, the representatives believed that his "self-criticism" did not expose his consistent anti-people and anti-socialist stance and the true purpose of his anti-Soviet and anti-Communist remarks made after the rectification campaign began.

In his self-criticism, Long Yun admitted that his remarks against the Soviet Union, against the Communist Party, and denying our country's ethnic minorities "were serious mistakes and had a negative impact on Sino-Soviet friendship and unity, socialist construction, and the leadership of the Party." However, he believed that these mistakes were only due to "not studying hard enough for the past eight years," "holding a high position and being detached from reality," and "having high blood pressure and being easily impulsive."

When criticizing his anti-Soviet remarks, Long Yun admitted that this was "not distinguishing between friend and foe," "confusing right and wrong," and "repaying kindness with malice," but he still emphasized that his motive was "patriotic" and only had the effect of being "anti-Soviet, anti-socialist, anti-Party, and anti-people" objectively. In his self-criticism, Long Yun also said that his provocative remarks denying the existence of ethnic minorities and claiming that "ethnic minorities should rely on their own efforts and not depend on others, and the Communist Party has no solution" were due to his "lack of understanding of the Communist Party's ethnic policy." Everyone believed that Long Yun's statement was a complete deception, and the representatives of various ethnic minorities were especially indignant. Everyone pointed out that Long Yun had consistently provoked the relationship between the Party and various ethnic minorities, and his fallacious remarks denying the existence of ethnic minorities after the start of the rectification campaign were not accidental.

Many representatives expressed even greater dissatisfaction with Long Yun's repeated boasting in his "self-criticism" about his advocacy of "enriching the country and strengthening the military," his "hatred of Chiang" and "opposition to Chiang" during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and his claim that the people's desire for democracy and freedom "fully conformed to my subjective wishes." The representatives said that Long Yun's crimes of exploiting and massacring the people during his eighteen years of rule in Yunnan "cannot be washed away even by the waters of the Jinsha River." (Editor's note: For detailed information on the Yunnan delegation group's criticism of Long Yun's reactionary remarks in recent days, see page two of today's newspaper.)

Luo Longji repeated the same words he said yesterday in the Jiangxi delegation group today. The representatives believed that Luo Longji's speech yesterday was a slight improvement compared to the previous few days, but today he has regressed. They hoped that Luo Longji would bravely confess the specific activities of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

The Hubei delegation group continued to criticize the reactionary words and deeds of Ma Zhemin, director of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and a member of the Luo Longji clique, today. According to the representatives, Ma Zhemin took advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to launch a frenzied attack on the Communist Party, starting fires everywhere and spreading various reactionary remarks, such as saying that "the suppression of counter-revolutionaries is the logic of killing," saying that "the Communist Party has hindered society," saying that "the Communist Party only knows how to hate people and does not know how to love people," saying that the Communist Party "treats people like slaves," and saying that "Marxism-Leninism is empiricism plus dogmatism," and so on. At today's group meeting, Ma Zhemin once again made a "self-criticism," but still did not examine his reactionary words and deeds or confess his relationship with the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Representatives of the Zhejiang delegation group have been exposing and refuting the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of Song Yunbin and Li Shihao in recent days. The representatives said that at the beginning of the rectification movement, Song Yunbin, as the vice chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League and the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, used his legal status to start fires everywhere, exaggerating the individual shortcomings he saw during his inspection, and aggressively saying that the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China was not good enough and that this rectification movement should be used to concentrate fire on rectifying the Communist Party. He also provoked the relationship between students, parents, and the Party on the issue of students entering higher education, giving reports to teachers at a certain middle school several times to promote his reactionary remarks. The representatives also said that Song Yunbin was also a stronghold of Wenhui Daily in Zhejiang, Xu Zhucheng was his close friend, and all the reporters from Wenhui Daily who went to Hangzhou to start fires went through him. However, Song Yunbin has not made a deep self-criticism or confession on these issues.

Li Shihao is the person in charge of the Zhejiang local organization of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. He played a role of "echoing from the south and the north" with Zhang Bojun during the period of "great blooming and contending." When Zhang Bojun proposed a "political design institute" in Beijing, Li Shihao proposed in Hangzhou the issue of "reconsidering the role and status of democratic parties and their relationship with the Party." Li Shihao has admitted that some of his anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks were "different tunes played with equal skill" as Zhang Bojun, and said that he was implementing Zhang Bojun's "policy, guidelines, and line."

At the Jiangsu delegation group meeting, Fei Xiaotong exposed Zeng Zhaolun during his self-criticism. He said that the "Several Opinions on Issues Related to China's Scientific System," which was criticized by Guo Moruo as an anti-socialist scientific program and was proposed in the name of the temporary research group on "Scientific Planning Issues" of the China Democratic League, was initially drafted by Zeng Zhaolun and was ultimately decided by Zeng Zhaolun to be published in Guangming Daily on June 9. Fei Xiaotong said that in March of this year, when the China Democratic League held a national working conference, Zeng Zhaolun wrote a note to Fei Xiaotong, saying that the Ministry of Higher Education was preparing to release several issues, including the teaching system issue and the scientific planning issue. Fei Xiaotong forwarded this note to Zhang Bojun, asking whether Zhang wanted to "proceed." If he wanted to "proceed," he would invite people to talk about it. Zhang Bojun said "it can be proceeded," and Luo Longji also agreed. On the evening of June 2, at the CPPCC Cultural Club, Zeng Zhaolun handed the typed scientific system plan mentioned above to Fei Xiaotong, asking Fei to revise it. Fei said that he made some revisions at the time and added two sentences. After Fei revised it, Zeng Zhaolun took it back for typing. On June 5, Zeng Zhaolun and two others convened a meeting to discuss the plan revised by Fei Xiaotong. According to Fei Xiaotong, the proposal to establish the so-called China Democratic League "Scientific Planning Issues" group meeting was first proposed by Zeng Zhaolun.

Xia Yan of the Shanghai delegation group exposed Xu Zhucheng's consistent exclusion of Communist Party members working at Wenhui Daily. In the past, when Huan Xiang worked at Wenhui Daily, Xu was dissatisfied; later, when Wenhui Daily moved to Hong Kong and resumed publication, Xu resolutely refused to allow Huan Xiang to participate in the work of Wenhui Daily and asked two other Party members to withdraw from Wenhui Daily. After liberation, Xu Zhucheng repeatedly squeezed out Party member leading cadres, or placed Communist Party members in positions where they could not play a decisive role. For example, during the period of "great blooming and contending," Xu transferred Qin Benli, the Party member leading cadre of Wenhui Daily, to the international department, making it impossible for Qin to lead the reporting work on domestic "blooming and contending" issues.

In recent days, in addition to sternly refuting the anti-Party and anti-socialist words and deeds of the rightists, overseas Chinese representatives have also suggested that the government assist overseas Chinese in developing the mountains and wastelands of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Fujian provinces during the Second Five-Year Plan period to cultivate subtropical economic crops.

In recent days, the Anhui, Sichuan, and Guizhou delegation groups have offered many criticisms and suggestions while discussing various government work. Zhou Susheng, a representative from Anhui Province, suggested that the government establish a special agency and stipulate some systems to handle waste products. The representatives from Anhui Province strongly agreed with Zhou Susheng's suggestion.

Some representatives in the Guizhou delegation group raised opinions on issues such as the distribution of universities and scientific research work. Representative Luo Dengyi believed that there were too many universities distributed in Beijing. Some schools, such as the Iron and Steel Institute and the Petroleum Institute, could be established near iron and steel bases and petroleum bases, which would greatly benefit the connection between schools and industrial departments and the close combination of theory and practice. He believed that the excessive concentration of schools not only had a certain impact on student training, but also increased the urban population and added a burden to the city.

Qin Renchang, a representative from Yunnan Province and a botanist, suggested that the government give appropriate attention to the development of animal husbandry. He said that many regions in our country, such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, northwestern Yunnan, and western Sichuan, are animal husbandry areas. Whether animal husbandry develops or not is not only related to the lives of the vast people, especially ethnic minorities, but is also an important part of our country's national economy. In the past few years, our country's animal husbandry has developed, but in the 1957 national economic development plan, not enough emphasis was placed on the development of animal husbandry. He hoped that the central government would invest appropriately in animal husbandry to further develop our country's animal husbandry.

    人民代表继续批判右派分子
    龙云的“检讨”没有暴露他一贯反动的立场
    据新华社6日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天下午继续进行大会讨论。
    今天在大会上发言的代表有许崇清、陈其尤、毛鹤年、汪世铭、周谷城、荣毅仁、杨定安、吴晗、孙作宾、陈汝棠、高镇五、李仿尧、吴通明、陆镇藩、巩天民，书面发言的代表有马叙伦、邓国章、叶圣陶、邓文钊、安文钦，共二十人。他们用具体事实说明了几年来我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设所取得的巨大成绩，对工作中的缺点和问题提出了批评建议。许多代表继续严正地驳斥了资产阶级右派分子反社会主义的反动言行。
    今天大会执行主席是：陈叔通、程潜、吴玉章、邓颖超、马明方、赵毛臣、赵忠尧、陈望道、刀京版。
    今天的会议从下午三时开始，到七时结束。
    明天星期日，将休会一天。
    据新华社6日讯　全国人民代表大会第四次会议许多代表小组今天上午继续揭露和批判资产阶级右派分子的反动言行。连日来许多代表小组还讨论了政府各方面的工作，提出了批评和建议。
    云南省代表小组在昨天晚间和今天上午举行小组会，进一步揭露和批判了龙云的反动言行。
    在代表们一再督促下，龙云昨天晚上在小组会上宣读了他的书面的“思想检讨”。但是，代表们认为他的“检讨”没有暴露他一贯反人民反社会主义的立场和在整风以后发出的反苏反共言论的真实目的。
    龙云在检讨中，承认他的反苏、反共、否认我国少数民族等言行“是犯了严重的错误，对中苏友谊团结，社会主义的建设，党的领导都有坏的影响”。但是他认为，产生这些错误，只是由于“八年来没有好好学习”，“忝居高位，脱离实际”，“血压过高，容易冲动”。
    龙云在检讨他的反苏言行时，承认这是“不分敌我”、“混淆是非”、“以怨报德”，但他仍然强调他的动机是“爱国”的，只在客观上起了“反苏、反社会主义、反党、反人民”的效果。龙云在检讨中，还说他发表否认少数民族以及“少数民族应自力更生，不要依靠别人，共产党没什么办法”等挑拨性言论，是由于他“不了解共产党的民族政策”。大家认为，龙云的这种说法是彻头彻尾的欺骗，各少数民族代表尤其愤慨。大家指出，龙云一贯挑拨党和各少数民族的关系，他在整风开始后又发表否认少数民族存在的谬论，并不是偶然的。
    许多代表对于龙云在“检讨”中，一再夸耀的所谓他主张“富国强兵”，在抗日战争时期“仇蒋”、“反蒋”，人民渴望民主自由“十分符合我的主观愿望”等言论，表示了更大的不满。代表们说，龙云统治云南十八年，剥削和屠杀人民的罪恶，是“金沙江水也洗不清的”。（编者按：几日来云南代表小组批判龙云反动言行的详细情况，见今日本报二版）
    罗隆基今天在江西省代表小组重复他昨天讲过的话。代表们认为，罗隆基昨天的发言比前几天有了一点进步，但是今天却倒退了。他们希望罗隆基勇敢地交代章罗联盟的具体活动。
    湖北省代表小组今天继续批判了民盟湖北省委主任委员、罗隆基小集团成员之一马哲民的反动言行。据代表们揭露，马哲民利用共产党整风机会向共产党进行了疯狂的进攻，到处点火，散布各种反动言论，如说“肃反是杀人的逻辑”，说“共产党对社会起了阻碍作用”，说“共产党是只知恨人不知爱人”，说共产党“把人当奴隶”，说“马列主义是经验主义加教条主义”等等。在今天的小组会上，马哲民再次作了“检讨”，但是仍没有检查自己的反动言行，交代和章罗联盟的关系。
    浙江省小组的代表连日来对宋云彬和李士豪的反党反社会主义言行进行揭露和驳斥。代表们说，在整风运动开始的时候，身为浙江省民盟副主委、浙江省文联主席的宋云彬利用自己的合法地位到处放火，把视察中见到的个别缺点加以夸大，气势汹汹地说中共浙江省委不行，要用这次整风的机会集中火力整共产党。他并在学生升学问题上挑拨学生、家长和党的关系，几次到某中学向教师作报告，宣传他的反动言论。代表们还说，宋云彬还是文汇报在浙江的据点，徐铸成是他的密友，文汇报所有到杭州去点火的记者都是通过他的。但是，宋云彬对这些问题都没有作深刻检讨和交代。
    李士豪是农工民主党浙江地方组织的负责人。他在大放大鸣中和章伯钧起了“南北呼应”的作用。当章伯钧在北京提出“政治设计院”的时候，李士豪就在杭州提出“要重新考虑民主党派的作用、地位与党的关系”问题。李士豪已承认他说的一些反党反社会主义言论与章伯钧是“异曲同工”，并且说他是执行了章伯钧的“政策方针路线”。
    在江苏省代表小组会上，费孝通在作自我批判时揭发了曾昭抡。他说，被郭沫若斥之为一个反社会主义的科学纲领的用民盟“科学规划问题”临时研究组名义提出的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”，其初稿系出自曾昭抡之手，并且最后由曾昭抡决定在6月9日光明日报上发表。费孝通说，今年3月民盟举行全国工作会议时，曾昭抡写了个纸条子给费孝通，说高等教育部准备把几个问题放出来，其中有教学制度问题、科学规划问题。费孝通把这个纸条子转给章伯钧，问章是否要“进行”，如果要“进行”，他就约人谈谈。章伯钧说“可以进行”，罗隆基也表示同意。6月2日晚上，在政协文化俱乐部，曾昭抡把打字的上述科学体制方案交给费孝通，要费修改。费说，他当时作了一些修改，并且加上了两句。费改过以后，曾昭抡又拿去打字。6月5日，曾昭抡等三人召集了一个会，讨论费孝通修改过的方案。据费孝通说，要设立所谓民盟“科学规划问题”小组会，最早也是曾昭抡提出来的。
    上海市代表小组夏衍揭露了徐铸成一贯排斥在文汇报工作的共产党员的事实。过去宦乡在文汇报工作，徐就不满；后来文汇报搬到香港复刊，徐坚决不要宦乡参加文汇报工作，并要另外两个党员退出文汇报。解放后，徐铸成又屡次把党员负责干部排挤出来，或者把共产党员放在不能起决定作用的位置上。如在大鸣大放期间，徐把文汇报的党员负责干部钦本立调到国际部去，使钦无法领导国内鸣放问题的报道工作。
    华侨代表们，最近几天除严厉地驳斥了右派分子的反党反社会主义的言行外，还建议政府在第二个五年计划期间协助华侨开发广东、广西、云南和福建等省的山林荒地，垦植亚热带经济作物。
    安徽、四川、贵州等代表小组连日来在讨论政府各项工作中，提出了许多批评建议。安徽省代表周苏生建议政府设立专门机构，规定一些制度，来处理废品。安徽省代表很同意周苏生的建议。
    贵州省代表小组中有些代表对高等学校的分布、科学研究工作等问题，提出了意见。罗登义代表认为北京高等学校分布过多，有些学校如钢铁学院、石油学院等，完全可以设立在钢铁基地和石油基地附近，这样对于学校和产业部门的联系，对于理论和实际密切结合，都有很大好处。他认为学校过于集中，不但对学生培养有一定影响，而且使城市人口增多，给城市增加了负担。
    云南省代表、植物学家秦仁昌建议政府对发展畜牧业给以适当重视。他说，我国内蒙、新疆、青海、云南西北部、四川西部等许多地区，都是畜牧区。畜牧业发展与否，不但关系到广大人民特别是少数民族的生活，而且也是我国国民经济的重要组成部分。过去几年我国畜牧业是有发展的，但是在1957年国民经济发展计划中，对发展畜牧业强调不够。他希望中央对畜牧业给以适当投资，进一步发展我国的畜牧业。
