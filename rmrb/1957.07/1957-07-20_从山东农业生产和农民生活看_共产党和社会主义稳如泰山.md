From Shandong's Agricultural Production and Farmers' Lives:
The Communist Party and Socialism are as Solid as Mount Tai

In the first year after basic collectivization (1956), Shandong's total agricultural output value increased by 17%, nearly six times higher than the growth rate in the first three years of the Five-Year Plan. The amount of food available to farmers per person per year is increasing year by year, and their purchasing power is growing year by year. Farmers' lives have improved significantly compared to the past, but the standard is still relatively low. In 1956, there were shortcomings and errors such as neglecting sideline occupations and coarse grain production. Efforts are being made to achieve an average of 700 jin of grain per person within three to five years. The words and deeds of the rightists are merely a few poisonous weeds on Mount Tai. We can distinguish between well-intentioned criticism and malicious attacks.

Zhao Jianmin's Speech

In this meeting, I further studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and listened to the reports of Premier Zhou and other responsible comrades. I agree with and support these reports and will resolutely implement them.

Now I would like to talk about some opinions on agricultural production and farmers' lives in Shandong Province. In our province, 96.2% of farm households have joined cooperatives, of which 84.2% have joined advanced cooperatives, thus changing the face of small-scale individual farming that has existed for thousands of years. The socialist consciousness and production enthusiasm of farmers are unprecedentedly high. Although some areas suffered severe natural disasters in 1956, agricultural production still achieved a bumper harvest. Total grain output reached 29.35 billion jin, an increase of 8.7% over 1955, exceeding the highest pre-war annual output by 36.7% and exceeding the level of the First Five-Year Plan by 2.9%. The total agricultural output value was about 5.1 billion yuan, an increase of 17% over 1955, about six times higher than the growth rate of 2.2% in the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan. This fully demonstrates the superiority of collectivization and the great achievements of the Party and the government in rural work. According to a typical survey of income distribution in 746 agricultural cooperatives in 53 counties and cities in 1956, it is estimated that 63% of cooperative members in the province increased their income compared to 1955, 14% remained the same, and 23% decreased slightly. The vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants increased their income. Most of those who had reduced income were rich peasants and upper-middle peasants. Their income was much higher than that of poor peasants in the past. In the first year of cooperative establishment, there was no foundation, and some were affected by disasters, so a decrease in income was natural. The situation in cooperatives that had been established for three to five years was different, and the income of upper-middle peasants also increased. Secondly, the income of cooperative members in some severely affected areas decreased. Furthermore, some cooperatives were poorly managed, with large projects and waste, which also led to a reduction in the income of cooperative members. It should be noted that 1956 was a year of great changes in the foundation of small-scale individual farming that had existed for thousands of years. Thousands of households of individual farmers had just come together, with a weak foundation, farmers were not yet accustomed, cadres lacked experience, and the various working systems within the cooperative were not yet in place. In particular, some cooperatives suffered severe natural disasters in the first year. Under such circumstances, the vast majority of cooperatives increased their output, which is a huge achievement!

What is the life of farmers like now? Shandong is a province with a large population and little land. Grain output is lower than the national average, and the lives of farmers are still lower than those in other provinces. But compared to the past, the lives of farmers have improved significantly. From the perspective of the amount of food available to farmers throughout the province: according to the survey, the average annual food ration per person was 363 jin in 1954, 368 jin in 1955, and 393 jin in 1956; and the quality of food gradually improved. Of course, the living standards vary from region to region, with the high reaching more than 500 jin per person per year and the low less than 360 jin. Farmers' incomes are also different. The average annual income per person in Jiaodong and Luxibei technical crop areas is about 130 yuan, while the average annual income per person in Luzhongnan is about 65 yuan. The income per person in cotton and tobacco areas is about 25% greater than that in grain areas. From the perspective of farmers' purchasing power: the average annual purchasing power per person was 16.04 yuan in 1950, 29.29 yuan in 1952, 37.69 yuan in 1955, and 42.16 yuan in 1956. Farmers' purchasing power in 1956 increased by 1.63 times compared to 1950 (purchasing power includes the purchase of means of production). From the perspective of farmers' clothing: in the old society, about 60% of farmers wore clothes with patches upon patches, with 60-year-old cotton-padded jackets and 20-year-old coats. Now, when you go to the countryside, you can see that more than 70% of farmers are warmly and well-dressed, and clothes with patches upon patches are rarely seen. The above situation proves that most farmers can eat their fill and dress warmly, and some farmers eat well, dress well, and have surpluses. The life of being scantily clad, not having enough to eat, and eating chaff and vegetables for half a year is gone forever. However, about 15% of farm households in rural areas still have relatively difficult lives. These households are mostly those with large populations and few laborers, as well as those affected by illness and disaster. It is difficult for their labor income to maintain the lives of the whole family. Furthermore, households affected by disaster have difficult lives. The cooperatives have just been established, and the public accumulation and welfare funds are small. For the time being, only the five-guarantee households can be taken care of, and it is not possible to take care of all of the above households, so their lives are relatively difficult for the time being. Although these households have difficulties in life, they are still better off than in the past with the relief and assistance of the government and the cooperatives. In the old society, some of these households had to flee famine, beg for food, sell their children, and become separated from their wives and children.

Although the lives of farmers have improved significantly compared to the past, the standard of living is still relatively low at present, and the rate of improvement in living standards is also relatively slow. This is because: (1) China used to be a backward agricultural country with a poor foundation and backward tools, so production and life could not be raised too high all at once. (2) Precisely because of the above reasons, the labor value created by farmers is low. For example, farmers' living consumption accounts for 75% of the value of output income. (3) The abundance or scarcity of agricultural production still largely depends on natural conditions and it is not yet possible to completely overcome natural disasters. (4) Our province has a large population and little land. The population is increasing year by year, but the land cannot be increased, and the amount of land owned per person is shrinking year by year. In addition, the area of cash crops is expanding, the area of construction land is increasing, and the area of grain cultivation is shrinking, which is also a reason. For example, our province increased by about 1.1 million people last year. Calculating 360 jin of food per person, 396 million jin of grain is used up in one year. Eating an extra half ounce of grain per person per day does not seem to improve life much, but our province with 52 million people must increase grain production by 1.17 billion jin throughout the year. In addition, Shandong's characteristic is that there are many sweet potatoes, which account for about one-third of the food ration. If sweet potatoes are not preserved well and rot, it will seriously affect life.

Some people cannot see the above overall situation, or avoid talking about the overall situation, and only criticize and blame, saying that rural work is a mess and that farmers' lives are miserable, which is obviously wrong.

Of course, we also have many shortcomings and errors in our rural work. For more than a year, we have concentrated our efforts on carrying out the grain production increase campaign, but have neglected sideline production, so sideline income has decreased somewhat compared to the past, and farmers feel short of money. Secondly, the arrangement of the sown area of grain crops was not appropriate last year, and the sown area of some miscellaneous grains and minor miscellaneous grains was reduced compared to 1955, such as sorghum reduced by 7.86 million mu, mung beans reduced by 490,000 mu, and peas reduced by 260,000 mu. As a result, some farmers feel that the food is simple, eat whatever they have, and cannot adjust their lives, and feel that there is insufficient firewood. Furthermore, insufficient attention was paid to the raising and breeding of livestock, and the number of cattle, mules, and donkeys decreased somewhat compared to 1955. In addition, some individual areas purchased a little more and supplied a little less or the supply was not timely, resulting in some farmers not having enough food to eat and living in difficulty. At present, some third-category cooperatives still have many problems and are relatively chaotic, requiring vigorous rectification.

The above shortcomings and errors are closely related to our leadership's bureaucracy and subjectivism. Of course, some are also due to our lack of experience in our work. We will continue to deeply implement the Party Central Committee's instructions on rectification and Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," resolutely overcome the leadership's bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, vigorously lead farmers to carry out the production increase and economy campaign, implement the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, and strive to achieve an average of 700 jin of grain per person (now it is 574 jin) within three to five years, so that all farmers "eat their fill and dress warmly," and strive to make all farmers "eat well and dress well" in about ten years. According to Shandong's various conditions, we are very confident of achieving the above requirements, so that farmers can gradually improve their lives better on the basis of production development.

Since Shandong launched the rectification campaign, the democratic parties, democrats, intellectuals, and people from other walks of life have put forward many opinions to the Party in order to improve and enhance the Party's leadership and to strengthen the socialist system, and have carried out sharp and pertinent criticisms, which have been of great help to the Party's rectification. Although some criticisms are one-sided and somewhat extreme in attitude, the motives are good and should be welcomed. However, it must also be pointed out that a very small number of rightists are engaging in activities with ulterior motives in the name of helping the Party to rectify itself. They seize on certain shortcomings in our work and exaggerate and slander them, fundamentally negating all the achievements in our work and provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses. They attack and insult some progressive people who are close to the Communist Party. Some of them propose to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party and implement joint leadership by all parties, the so-called "the stupid get out, the capable get on." Some people who were struggled against in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement shouted that they were wronged. A very small number of them are indeed wronged and have been or are being corrected. However, some people do have crimes in history and are not wronged. They want to take the opportunity to counterattack, and some even continue to engage in sabotage activities, adding crime to crime. In short, their purpose is to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism. They think that the Communist Party is already "crippled" and that the "opportunity" for restoration has arrived. They think that "the Communist Party is already sick and bedridden," lost consciousness, and cannot distinguish between good people and bad people. Therefore, pretending to be doctors treating diseases, they want to kill the Communist Party with one blow. Why do they dare to be so rampant? The reason is very simple: this is a fierce class struggle. Now I cannot but remind them that the Communist Party has taken root among 600 million people and can never be overthrown! Your behavior is just like a few poisonous weeds on Mount Tai. Let you instigate it! It is a dream to try to instigate the Communist Party, which is as solid as Mount Tai! The Chinese people will never forget that it was the Communist Party of China that led the people to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, thereby liberating the Chinese people! It was the Communist Party that led the people to help the Korean people defeat the aggression of American imperialism, thereby defending the independence of the motherland and safeguarding the safe construction of the motherland! It was the Communist Party that led the people to heal the wounds of war and build the motherland so strongly, thereby making China, which had been humble and submissive for more than a hundred years, stand tall in the world! It is the Communist Party that is leading the people to strive to build a backward agricultural country into a prosperous and strong socialist industrial country! Therefore, the 600 million Chinese people will always follow the Communist Party.

At the same time, it should also be explained that some democratic people in Shandong recently saw that we were counter-criticizing the rightists and did not dare to continue to criticize the shortcomings and errors of the Party, fearing that they would be labeled as rightists and suffer retaliation. I think this is a misunderstanding and unnecessary concern. Who is a friend, who is a rightist, what is well-intentioned criticism, and what is malicious attack, we can distinguish clearly. We sincerely hope that comrades and friends outside the Party will eliminate unnecessary concerns, boldly carry out criticism, and help the Party to rectify itself. The Communist Party will never avoid medical treatment and will never retaliate. Even those rightists, as long as they can pull back from the brink, admit their mistakes, change their positions, and support socialism, the Party and the people are still willing to unite and transform them and jointly build socialism.

Finally, I would like to make the following two suggestions:

(1) On the issue of immigration and land reclamation. There are many wastelands in our country that need to be reclaimed, and provinces with dense populations in the interior have sufficient labor force. Therefore, we should immigrate and reclaim land in a planned and step-by-step manner to develop production and improve people's lives. However, this is an extremely arduous and complex propaganda mobilization and organizational preparation work. Leaders at all levels lack experience, and the investment is very large. Therefore, it is recommended that relevant departments of the State Council convene a meeting of relevant provinces to summarize the experiences and lessons of immigration and land reclamation work in recent years and make detailed preparations for future immigration work and formulate an immigration and land reclamation plan.

(2) On the issue of preventing and handling water conservancy disputes. Water conservancy disputes are a historical legacy. Today and in the future, with the progress of water conservancy construction, internal contradictions among the people caused by water conservancy problems will continue to occur. Our province's Weiyun River is located downstream of Henan and Hebei; the Yishu and Nanyun Rivers of the Huai River system are located upstream of Jiangsu. In recent years, we have made many mistakes in the issue of water conservancy disputes. In order to timely solve and prevent water conservancy disputes, it is recommended that the State Council formulate "Principles and Regulations for Handling and Preventing Water Conservancy Disputes," such as the issue of obtaining the consent of both parties before carrying out water conservancy construction in two regions; the issue of unified understanding of customary law; and the issue of small interests being subordinate to large interests, which should have clear regulations.

Please criticize and correct any inappropriate points in my speech.

    从山东农业生产和农民生活看
    共产党和社会主义稳如泰山
    基本实现合作化后的第一年（1956年），山东农业总产值增长17％，比五年计划头三年的增长速度提高近六倍——农民每人实用口粮一年比一年多，购买力一年比一年大——农民生活比过去显著改善了，但水平仍然比较低——1956年曾发生了忽视副业和杂粮生产等缺点和错误——争取在三、五年内达到平均每人占有七百斤粮食——右派的言行不过是泰山上的几根毒草——我们对善意的批评和恶意的攻击是能够分辨的
    赵健民的发言
    在这次会议中，进一步地学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，听了周总理和其他负责同志的报告。我同意和拥护这些报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我就山东省的农业生产和农民生活问题谈一些意见。我省已经入社的农户占总农户的百分之九十六点二，其中参加高级社的占总农户的百分之八十四点二，从而改变了几千年来个体小农经济的面貌，农民的社会主义觉悟和生产积极性空前高涨。虽然一九五六年部分地区遭到严重自然灾害，但农业生产仍然获得丰收，粮食总产量达到二百九十三点五亿斤，比一九五五年增长百分之八点七，超过战前最高年产量的百分之三十六点七，超过第一个五年计划水平的百分之二点九。农业总产值约五十一亿元，比一九五五年增长百分之十七，约比第一个五年计划前三年增长速度百分之二点二提高了近六倍，这充分显示了合作化的优越性，显示了党和政府在农村工作中的巨大成绩。根据一九五六年五十三个县、市，七百四十六个农业社收益分配的典型调查估算，全省有百分之六十三的社员比一九五五年增加了收入，有百分之十四的社员不增不减，有百分之二十三的社员比一九五五年的收入有些减少。绝大部分的贫农和下中农都增加了收入。减少收入的，大部分是富农和上中农，他们过去的收入比贫农高的多，在合作社初办的第一年，没有基础，有的还遭到灾害，减少收入也是自然的情况，三、五年的老社情况就不同了，上中农的收入也有增加；其次有些重灾区的社员收入减少了；再是部分社经营管理不善，铺的摊子大，浪费大，也造成了社员收入的减少。应该看到：一九五六年是几千年来个体小农经济基础大变革的一年，千家万户的个体农民刚凑在一起，底子薄，农民还不习惯，干部还缺乏经验，社内各项工作制度尚未就绪；特别是有些社头一年就遭到严重自然灾害，在这种情况下，绝大部分合作社增加了产量，这是一个巨大的成绩！
    现在农民的生活究竟怎样呢？我们山东是一个人口多、土地少的省份，粮食产量低于全国的平均水平，农民生活比别的省份还是低的。但是比较过去，农民的生活是有了显著改善。从全省农民实用口粮方面看：据调查一九五四年每人全年平均口粮三百六十三斤，一九五五年是三百六十八斤，一九五六年是三百九十三斤；而且用粮质量逐步提高。当然地区与地区之间生活不一，高的每人全年口粮五百多斤，低的还不足三百六十斤。农民的收入也不一样，胶东、鲁西北各技术作物区每人全年平均收入一百三十元左右，而鲁中南每人全年平均收入六十五元左右，棉区和烟区每人收入约大于粮区的百分之二十五。从农民购买力方面看：一九五○年每人全年平均十六点零四元，一九五二年是二十九点二九元，一九五五年是三十七点六九元，一九五六年是四十二点一六元；一九五六年农民购买力比一九五○年增加了一点六三倍（购买力中包括购买生产资料）。从农民穿衣服方面看：旧社会有百分之六十左右的农民穿补钉加补钉的衣服，有六十年的棉袄，二十年的褂子；现在到农村看一看，有百分之七十以上的农民穿的暖穿的好，补钉加补钉的衣服很少见。上述情况证明：大部分农民可以吃饱穿暖，有些农民吃的好，穿的好，还有剩余。衣不蔽体、食不饱肚、糠菜半年粮的生活一去不复返了。但是，目前农村仍有百分之十五左右的农户生活较困难。这些困难户，大都是人口多而劳力少和病灾户，他们的劳动所得很难维持全家的生活；再是受灾户生活困难。合作社刚成立，公积公益金很少，暂时只能照顾五保户，对上述户还不可能全部照顾，所以他们的生活暂时就比较困难。这些户虽然生活上困难，但在政府及合作社的救济和帮助下，比过去还是好的；在旧社会这些户中有的就得逃荒、要饭、出卖子女、妻离子散。
    农民的生活虽然比过去有了显著改善，但就目前来讲，生活水平还是比较低的，而且生活上升的速度也是比较缓慢的。这是因为：（1）中国过去是一个落后的农业国，底子穷、工具落后，因而生产和生活还不可能一下子提得太高；（2）正因为上述原因，农民所创造的劳动价值低，如农民的生活消费就占了产值收入的百分之七十五；（3）农业生产的丰歉，目前在很大程度上还是取决于自然条件，还不可能完全战胜自然灾害；（4）我省人多地少，人口逐年增加，而土地不能增加，每人平均占有土地量逐年缩小，再加上经济作物面积扩大，建设用地增加，而粮食种植面积缩小了，这也是一个原因。如我省去年约增加了一百一十万人口，每人按三百六十斤口粮计，一年即用去粮食三亿九千六百万斤。每人每天多吃半两粮食，在生活上并看不出有什么改善，可是我省五千二百万人口，全年就得增产粮食十一亿七千万斤。此外，我们山东的特点是地瓜多，在口粮中地瓜占了三分之一左右，如果地瓜保存不好，霉烂了，就严重地影响到生活。
    有些人看不到上述全面情况，或者避而不谈全面情况，一味地批评责难，说农村工作一团糟，说农民生活苦，这显然是错误的。
    当然，我们在农村工作上也有不少缺点和错误。一年多以来，我们集中力量开展粮食的增产运动，而对副业生产有所忽视，因而副业收入比过去有些减少，农民感到钱紧。其次，去年对粮食作物播种面积安排不够妥善，有些杂粮及小杂粮的播种面积比一九五五年减少了，如高粱减少七百八十六万亩，绿豆减少四十九万亩，豌豆减少二十六万亩，因而部分农民感到食粮单纯，有什么吃什么，无法调剂生活，并感到烧柴不足。再是对牲畜的饲养繁殖注意不够，牛、骡、驴比一九五五年减少了一些。此外，个别地区统购多了一些，供应少了一些或供应不及时，致使一部分农民粮食不够吃，生活困难。目前仍有些三类社问题很多，比较混乱，需要大力整顿。
    以上缺点和错误与我们领导上的官僚主义、主观主义是有很大关系的，当然也有些是属于我们工作上缺乏经验所致。我们将继续深入地贯彻执行党中央关于整风的指示和毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，坚决克服领导上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，大力领导农民开展增产节约运动，贯彻勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，争取在三、五年内达到平均每人占有七百斤粮食（现在是五百七十四斤），使所有农民“吃饱穿暖”，争取在十年左右使所有农民“吃好穿好”。根据山东各方面的条件，我们很有信心达到上述要求，使农民在生产发展的基础上，逐步地更好地改善生活。
    我们山东自开展整风以来，各民主党派、民主人士、知识分子和其他各界人民，为了改进和提高党的领导，为了加强社会主义制度，给党提出了很多意见，开展了尖锐而中肯的批评，这对党的整风有很大的帮助；虽然有些批评存在片面性，在态度上有些偏激，但动机还是好的，应该欢迎。但是，也不能不指出：有极少数右派分子，借帮助党整风的名义，进行别有用心的活动。他们抓着我们工作中的某些缺点加以夸大、诽谤，根本否定我们工作中的一切成绩，挑拨党群关系；他们打击、辱骂靠拢共产党的一些进步人士；他们有的提出取消共产党的领导，要实行各党派共同领导，所谓“愚者滚蛋，贤者上台”。有些在肃反运动中被斗争的人大喊冤枉，其中有极少数人是真冤枉，现已纠正和正在纠正中，但有些人历史上确实有罪恶，并不冤枉，他们想乘机反扑，有的并继续进行破坏活动，罪上加罪。总之他们的目的是反对共产党，反对社会主义。他们认为共产党已经“残废了”，复辟的“时机”到了，认为“共产党已经病得卧床不起”，失去知觉，辨别不出好人和坏人了。因此假装医生治病的面孔，想一棍子打死共产党。他们为什么竟敢如此猖狂呢？道理很简单：这是激烈的阶级斗争。现在我不能不提醒他们：共产党在六亿人民中已经生了根，是永远打不倒的！你们的行为只不过是像泰山上的几根毒草，任你煽动吧！要想把稳如泰山的共产党煽动倒，那是作梦！中国人民永远不会忘记：是中国共产党领导人民打倒了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，从而使中国人民翻了身，得到了解放！是共产党领导人民帮助朝鲜人民打退了美帝国主义的进攻，从而保卫了祖国的独立，保卫了祖国的安全建设！是共产党领导人民医治了战争的创伤，把祖国建设得这么强大，从而使百余年来卑躬屈膝的中国在世界上挺起了胸膛！是共产党领导人民正在为把一个落后的农业国建设成为一个繁荣富强的社会主义工业国而奋斗！所以六亿中国人民是会永远跟着共产党走的。
    同时也应该说明：在我们山东最近有部分民主人士，看到我们对右派分子进行反批评，就不敢继续批评党的缺点错误了，怕戴上右派分子的帽子，怕受打击报复。我认为这是一个误会，是不必要的顾虑。谁是朋友，谁是右派分子，那是善意的批评，那是恶意的攻击，我们是能够辨别清楚的。我们恳切地希望党外同志们、朋友们，消除不必要的顾虑，大胆地开展批评，帮助党整风。共产党绝不讳疾忌医，更不会打击报复。就是那些右派分子，只要他们能悬崖勒马，承认错误，改变立场，拥护社会主义，党和人民仍然愿意团结改造他们，共同建设社会主义。
    最后，提出如下两点建议：
    （一）关于移民垦荒问题。我国需要开垦的荒地很多，内地人口稠密的省份又有充分的劳动力，因此应该有计划有步骤地移民垦荒，以发展生产，改善人民生活。但这是一项极其繁重复杂的宣传动员与组织准备工作，各级领导上缺乏经验，投资又很大，因此建议国务院有关部门召开有关省份的会议，总结几年来移民垦荒工作的经验教训，并对今后移民工作进行细致的准备，制定出移民垦荒规划。
    （二）关于防止与处理水利纠纷问题。水利纠纷是一个历史遗留下来的问题，在今天以及今后随着水利建设的进展，还会不断发生因水利问题而引起的人民内部矛盾。我省卫运河处在河南、河北下游；淮河系统的沂沭、南运河则处在江苏上游，几年来我们在水利纠纷问题上犯过不少错误。为了及时解决与防止水利纠纷，建议国务院制定“处理与防止水利纠纷的原则规定”，如有关两地区水利建设，在进行前必须取得双方同意的问题；习惯法的统一认识问题；小利益服从大利益的问题，均应有明确的规定。
    我的讲话有不妥之处，请批评指正。
