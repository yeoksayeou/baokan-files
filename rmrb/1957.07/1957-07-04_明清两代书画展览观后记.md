    Postscript to the Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting of the Ming and Qing Dynasties
    Zhang Boju
    China's art of calligraphy has been dormant for quite some time. Last year, the Palace Museum exhibited a selection of calligraphy from the Jin, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. Today, the calligraphy of the Ming and Qing dynasties is being exhibited at Beihai, which is exciting.
    Since the Qin dynasty, from Li Si onwards to the present, calligraphers have emerged in great numbers over these two thousand years. There are countless famous masters, each with their own distinct charm and style, and each era with its own unique form and appearance. However, the number of ancient ink works that have been preserved and passed down to the present is far less than that of paintings. Apart from the Warring States bamboo slips and Han dynasty wooden slips that have been excavated in recent years, there are only two Jin dynasty ink works: Lu Ji's "Ping Fu Tie" and Wang Xun's "Bo Yuan Tie." The rest are all copies or traced copies. Few Tang dynasty ink works have survived, and their authenticity is questionable. There are more Song and Yuan dynasty ink works, but they are mostly from the four major calligraphers of the Song dynasty and Cai Xiang is especially rare, the Yuan dynasty is not beyond Zhao Mengfu, Xian Yushu, etc., and the number of other calligraphers is not much. Therefore, to study brushwork from ancient ink works, one should look to the Ming and Qing dynasties. Firstly, there were many calligraphers in the Ming and Qing dynasties, and secondly, these two dynasties are closer to the present. The calligraphy of these two dynasties is still very important for tracing the origins and branches of research. The calligraphy section of this exhibition includes more than forty pieces, including vertical scrolls, hand scrolls, and fan paintings. Among the vertical scrolls, Fu Qingzhu's and Wang Duo's cursive scripts, Zhang Ruitu's running script, and Zheng Gu Kou's official script are all full of spirit, authentic and refined. Among the hand scrolls, Dong Qichang's running script stands out, with turns and folds that show squareness and no hint of roundness or affectation. There is a postscript at the end saying: "This is Shangshu's (董其昌) most得意 (satisfying) work. He used a chicken feather brush when writing it, following the style of Yan Lugong. He particularly treasured this kind of writing and specially inscribed it on a bolt of Wu silk for Master Wang Dongli, using the remaining ink to create this." There is also a long scroll by Zhang Ruitu, full of ink and spirit, and a scroll by Xia Yan of the Ming dynasty, written with a worn-out brush, with occasional brush strokes passing through the strokes, very old and vigorous. There is also a cursive script scroll by the Tiger Crouching Old Man, a poem scroll of Du Fu's "Autumn Thoughts", with a postscript by Zhou Zhaoxiang saying it is the work of Shi Kefa. Judging from the two seals under the signature, one says "Treasure of the Tiger Crouching Immortal" and the other says "Poetry follows Du Fu and calligraphy follows Wang Xizhi". This is not at all Shi Kefa's tone, and although the cursive script is wild, it is not elegant and must be the work of someone outside of officialdom. Among the fan paintings, the outstanding one is the gold-painted fan written by Gu Dingchen. Gu Dingchen's political reputation among the people of Jiangnan is somewhat like that of Peng Peng in the "Peng Gong An" and Shi Buquan in the "Shi Gong An". His ink works are rarely circulated. Although he is not a famous calligrapher, this fan painting is quite dangerous and upright. Yang Fa and Jin Nong's running cursive and official script are also masterpieces among the fan paintings. They are all outstanding among the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, and Yang Fa's works are especially rare. Huang Shen's cursive script fan painting is still in his style. He is known for his paintings, and calligraphy is his spare time. The calligraphy of other calligraphers such as Zha Shengsun, Weng Tanxi, Xu Jian'an, Jiang Shijie, Gong Banqian, and others are all authentic.
    Looking at this exhibition as a whole, the number and variety of calligraphers are not enough, and the second and third-rate works have not been exhibited. Exhibiting them batch by batch like this is also a way to allow visitors to concentrate and avoid being too tired. If hundreds of pieces are exhibited at once, visitors will feel overwhelmed and only be able to skim through them without being able to carefully ponder them.
    I suggest that museum operations should have a principle-based regulation. For example, the painting gallery of the Palace Museum should be a system of Chinese painting history, and the inscription and ink gallery should be a system of Chinese calligraphy history. All representative writers and representative works of an era should be included in this system. The redundant and repetitive cultural relics can also be allocated to local museums to enrich their content. In order to cooperate with the historical development of Beijing, it is still necessary to widely collect and enrich the cultural relics of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. In terms of exhibitions, the author's brief history and the content of the works should be introduced as much as possible. For cursive script, small seal script and other difficult-to-recognize fonts, a translation should be attached for the convenience of the public.

    明清两代书画展览观后记
    张伯驹
    中国的书法艺术已经沉寂了好些时候，去年故宫博物院展出了一次晋唐宋元法书，今天在北海又展出了明清两代的法书，这是令人感到兴奋的事。
    秦代以后，从李斯起直到现在，在这二千多年中书人辈出，著名的大家多不胜举，这么多的古今大小书家，各人有各人的不同的气韵风格，各个时代有各个时代的体势面貌，可是古代墨迹能保存流传到现在的，为数比画却少得多。除近年来陆续发掘出土的战国木简绘书和汉代木简以外，晋代墨迹只有陆机平复帖王珣伯远帖两帖，此外皆是临本钩本。唐代墨迹流传也不多，而且真伪杂陈，宋元墨迹比较多些，但不出四家而蔡特少，元不出赵子昂鲜于枢等，其他家数不多。因此要从古人墨迹观摹笔法，还应向明清两代去找寻，一则明清书家很多，二则明清两代去今较近，这两代的书法在研究方面探本分流，还是非常需要的。这次展出的法书部分有四十多件，包括立幅、手卷、扇面三类。立幅中傅青主、王铎的草书、张瑞图的行书、郑谷口的分书都是神采奕奕，真而且精，手卷里突出的有董其昌的行书，转折带方势无圆熟姿媚的习气，后面有一段跋语说：“此尚书极得意笔也，书时用鸡翎笔，法颜鲁公、最自矜重此一种书，特为王东里师题吴绫一匹，余墨作此”。另有张瑞图的一个长卷，笔酣墨饱，神采飞动，明人夏言的一个卷子，是用退笔写的，笔画间时有笔丝拂过，很老健苍劲。还有虎卧老人草书，杜工部秋兴诗卷，后有周肇祥跋谓是史可法笔。观其署款下有两方图章，一曰虎卧大仙墨宝，一曰诗宗李杜字法钟王。这根本不是史公的口气，而且草书虽狂而不雅，必系方外的作品。扇面中突出的有顾鼎臣写的泥金扇，顾鼎臣在江南民间的政治声望颇有些像彭公案里的彭朋，施公案里的施不全。他的墨迹流传很少，他虽不是一个有名的书家，但这一个扇面写得相当险劲挺拔。杨法、金农的行草隶书亦是扇面中的精品，在扬州八怪中他们都是杰出的，杨法的遗迹尤少。黄瘿瓢的草书扇面，还是他的一路。他以画名，书是他的余事。其余如查声山、翁覃溪、徐健庵、姜实节、龚半千及其他等各家的法书皆是真迹。
    统观这次展览，书法方面家数及数量还不够多，还有第二、三等批未能展出。似这样一批一批地展出也是一个办法，使参观的人可以精神集中，免得太累，数量太多一展出就是几百件，参观的人也会感到应接不暇，弄成走马看花，而不能仔细地揣摩。
    我建议博物馆业务应当有一个原则性的规定，例如故宫博物院的绘画馆应当是中国绘画史系统，铭刻墨迹馆应当是中国书法史系统。凡是一个时代的代表作家与代表作品，都应当归入这一个系统里。其多余重复的文物，也可以拨给地方博物馆来充实内容。为配合北京市的都市历史，对元明清的文物还需要广搜博采，予以丰富，在展览方面，应尽可能的介绍作者略历与作品内容，对书法的狂草、大小篆等不易辨识的字体附书释文，对群众就更便利了。
