Xinhua News Agency, July 27th: During the period of heavy rains in Shandong and Henan in July, the flood diversion and storage projects built over the years on the Sha River, Ying River, and Ru River in Henan, and the Yi and Shu Rivers in Shandong have all played a significant role. Thanks to the flood diversion and storage in the middle and upper reaches, the downstream areas of these rivers, with the strong defenses of the people in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, have not experienced any breaches as of now.

During this period, the Sha River experienced four extraordinarily large flood peaks in Yexian County. The Nihewa flood storage area, built in 1955 upstream of the Luohe Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, with an area of 100 square kilometers, was opened four times to store floodwater, accumulating 340 million cubic meters of water. The largest single diversion stored 130 million cubic meters, allowing the flood flow to be contained to around the designed flow rate of 3,000 cubic meters per second as it passed through the Luohe Railway Bridge. This ensured the normal operation of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and protected the safety of the more than one million mu of farmland along both sides of the railway, as well as the cities of Luohe and Zhoukou.

The Laowangpo flood storage project on the Hong River, another major tributary of the Huai River, has been diverting and storing floodwater since 1951, and there have been no breaches in this area since then. Although the water level of the Hong River was not particularly high this year, it did experience a series of significant flood peaks. It also diverted and stored floodwater four times, totaling 173 million cubic meters, with the largest single diversion being 91 million cubic meters, protecting approximately one million mu of land in the Xiping and Shangcai areas from flooding.

In addition, although the rainfall in the upper reaches of the reservoirs on the Ying River (Baisha), Shi River (Nanwan), Zhentou River (Baoshan), and Ru River (Banqiao) was not particularly heavy, the Baisha Reservoir has still intercepted over 80 million cubic meters of floodwater, reducing the burden and disaster situation on the Ying River below the Baisha Reservoir. The Banqiao Reservoir intercepted over 70 million cubic meters of floodwater, weakening the flood peak after the Ru River and Hong River merged.

### 鲁、豫境内蓄洪工程发挥作用

    鲁、豫境内蓄洪工程发挥作用
    据新华社27日讯　山东、河南7月暴雨时期，河南沙河、颍河、汝河等河，和山东沂、沭等河历年所修的分洪、蓄洪工程都发挥了很大的效益。由于中上游分洪、蓄洪，这些河流的下游在皖北和苏北人民的严防下面，截至目前都没有发生过漫决。
    这次沙河在叶县连续出现过四次特大洪峰。在这期间，1955年在京汉铁路的漯河铁桥上游建成的，一百平方公里面积的泥河洼蓄洪区曾经四次开闸，蓄洪三·四亿公方，最多的一次分蓄洪水一·三亿公方，使洪水流量通过漯河铁桥时能够约束在设计流量三千秒公方左右，从而保证了京汉铁路的正常通车，保障了铁路两岸、漯河市、周口市及沿河一百多万亩农田的安全。
    淮河另一条大支流洪河的老王坡蓄洪工程，自1951年以来，随时分蓄洪水后，这一带从没有决过口。今年7月初到现在，洪河的水虽然不特别大，但也一连出现相当大的洪峰，也曾四次分蓄洪水，共分洪一·七三亿公方，最多的一次分洪○·九一亿公方，保住了西平、上蔡一带百万亩左右的土地免于水灾。
  此外，颍河上的白沙，溮河上的南湾，溱头河上的薄山、汝河上的板桥等水库，虽然由于水库上游的雨量不太大，但是白沙水库也已拦蓄了八千多万公方洪水，减轻了白沙水库以下颍河的负担和灾情；板桥水库拦蓄了七千多万公方洪水，削弱了汝河和洪河汇流以后的洪峰。
