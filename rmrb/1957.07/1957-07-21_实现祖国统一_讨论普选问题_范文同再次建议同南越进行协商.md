Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 20th. Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote a letter to Ngo Dinh Diem on July 18, again suggesting a consultative conference be held to discuss the issue of free general elections to achieve national reunification. The full text of the letter is as follows:

For nearly a century, especially in the eight or nine years of the war of resistance, our people have persisted in unity and heroic struggle against imperialist aggression, against plots to split the country, and for the independence and unification of the motherland, and for the peace and happiness of all the people. The Geneva Accords restored peace to Vietnam and recognized that Vietnam's independence and unity fully conformed to the deep aspirations of all the people for generations and to the interests of world peace.

Based on the Geneva Accords and the aspirations of all the people, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a letter to the responsible authorities in the South on July 19, 1955, suggesting a consultative conference to discuss the issue of free general elections nationwide in order to achieve national reunification. On May 11, 1956, following the joint letter issued by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on May 8, 1956, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam once again suggested a consultative conference to discuss holding free general elections nationwide based on the principles of universality, equality, directness, and secrecy, while emphasizing the need to continue implementing the provisions of the Geneva Accords on the cessation of hostilities in order to consolidate peace and create favorable conditions for the general election.

The above suggestions demonstrate that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is constantly striving and is always ready to create all favorable conditions for realizing the most pressing aspiration of our people – that is, to consolidate peace and achieve national reunification.

The above letter has not yet been answered by the Government of the Republic of Vietnam, and consultation and general elections have not been realized. During this period, US imperialism has increasingly interfered in South Vietnam, such as strengthening military forces, intensifying the illegal transportation of foreign military personnel and new war materials, expanding and adding military bases in the South, and designating the South as a protected area of ​​the Southeast Asia Military Alliance. All of these are inseparable from US imperialism's war preparations and threaten peace in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. The policy of strengthening military forces and increasing US aid has led to the increasing stagnation of the Southern economy and its increasing dependence on foreign countries. Politically, the people's democratic rights and freedoms have been violated, and the patriotic sentiments and peaceful reunification aspirations of the Southern compatriots have been trampled upon and suppressed. Normal relations between the North and the South have been severed, seriously harming the interests and feelings of compatriots in both the North and the South.

In short, US imperialism's policy of interference has seriously infringed upon the independence, autonomy, and national spirit of the Southern people.

Sir:

The division of the country has made every Vietnamese patriot deeply worried about the fate of the nation and the future of the motherland, and has made the people of the South and the North long for and look forward to the reunion of the North and the South, the reunification of the country, and the ability of the people to live and work in peace and contentment.

The entire Vietnamese nation must resolutely unite and struggle to stop the division of the country and realize a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

Based on the will of all the people, I, on behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, am writing this letter again to suggest to the Southern authorities that a consultative conference be held between representatives of the governments of the two regions in order to discuss the issue of free general elections for the realization of national reunification.

The Government of the Republic of Vietnam has also announced that it hopes to unify the country through peaceful means and free general elections. This is what all the people demand must be realized. If the government of the Republic of Vietnam truly has such a desire, then this is a good foundation for us to jointly consult and solve all problems in the spirit of mutual understanding and tolerance for the highest interests of the motherland, in order to conduct free general elections and unify the country nationwide.

I hope that the Government of the Republic of Vietnam will not reject the reasonable and legitimate suggestion of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. We must make great efforts together to overcome all difficulties and try to answer the deep aspirations of all the people. Here, I would like to reiterate the suggestions made by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the past on the restoration and development of normal relations between the two regions in all aspects, in order to satisfy the interests and feelings of the people of the South and the North. This urgent demand of the people must be resolved.

### 实现祖国统一　讨论普选问题  范文同再次建议同南越进行协商

    实现祖国统一　讨论普选问题
    范文同再次建议同南越进行协商
    新华社河内20日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同7月18日写信给吴庭艳，再次建议召开协商会议来讨论实现国家统一的自由普选问题。这封信的全文如下：
    将近一个世纪、尤其是近八、九年抗战以来，我国人民曾经为反对帝国主义的侵略，反对分裂国家的阴谋，为争取祖国的独立和统一、全体人民的和平和幸福而坚持团结和英勇的斗争。日内瓦协议恢复了越南的和平，公认越南的独立和统一是完全符合于全体人民世世代代所期待的深切愿望和符合于世界和平的利益的。
    越南民主共和国政府根据日内瓦协议和全体人民的愿望，曾经在1955年7月19日致函南方负责当局，建议召开协商会议，讨论全国范围内的自由普选问题，以便实现国家的统一。1956年5月11日，继日内瓦会议两主席于1956年5月8日发表公函之后，越南民主共和国政府再一次建议召开协商会议，借以讨论在全国范围内按普遍、平等、直接和秘密的原则举行自由普选的问题，同时强调必须继续履行日内瓦协议关于停止敌对行动的各项条款，以便能够巩固和平，为普选创造有利条件。
    上述建议表明，越南民主共和国政府正在不断努力，并且随时准备着为实现我国人民最迫切的愿望——即为巩固和平和实现国家统一而创造一切顺利的条件。
    上述信件还未得到越南共和国政府的答复，协商和普选没有获得实现。就在这段期间，美帝国主义日益深入地干涉越南南方。如加强军事力量，加紧非法运入外国军事人员和新的战争物资，在南方扩充和增设军事基地，把南方划为东南亚军事联盟的保护地区，所有这些都同美帝国主义的备战阴谋分不开，威胁到越南和东南亚的和平。加强军事力量和加强美援的政策，使得南方经济日益停滞不前，日益附属于外国。在政治上，人民的自由民主权利被侵犯，南方同胞的爱国心和和平统一的愿望被蹂躏和镇压。南北正常关系被割裂，严重地损害了南北两方的同胞的利益和感情。
    总之，美帝国主义的干涉政策严重地侵犯了南方人民的独立、自主权和民族精神。
    先生：
    国家被分割的情况，使得每一个越南爱国者对国家的命运和祖国的前途深感忧虑，使南方和北方人民渴望和期待着南北团圆、国家统一和人民能够安居乐业。
    整个越南民族必须坚决团结起来进行斗争，目的在制止国家被分割的情况，实现一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南国家。
    根据全体人民的意志，我代表越南民主共和国政府再一次写这封信，向南方当局建议召开两地区的政府代表之间的协商会议，以便讨论为实现国家统一而举行的自由普选问题。
    越南共和国政府也曾经宣布说，它希望通过和平方式和自由普选来统一国家。这一点是全体人民要求必须实现的。越南共和国政权如果真正有这样的愿望，那么，这就是一个良好的基础，使得我们能够为了祖国的最高利益，而以互相谅解和忍让的精神来共同协商解决一切问题，以便在全国范围内进行自由普选和统一国家。
    我希望越南共和国政府不拒绝越南民主共和国政府的合情合理的建议。我们必须作出很大的努力，共同克服一切困难，设法答复全体人民的深切愿望。在此，我谨再次提出越南民主共和国政府过去就恢复和发展两地区之间在各方面的正常关系，以满足南方和北方人民的利益和感情问题的建议。人民的这个迫切要求必须得到解决。
