Tan Tiwu is a Double-Dealer of More Than Twenty Years
She said, "I myself have been able to have positions and power in the past and present because I am a double-dealer." "If I were not a double-dealer, the Kuomintang would have beheaded me upon their return."
(Our newspaper dispatch) At the joint meeting of the Central Committee Small Group and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) on July 27, many people thoroughly exposed the ugly face of the rightist Tan Tiwu, who had long concealed herself under the guise of a "leftist," with powerful facts, and some people who had been misled and deceived by Tan Tiwu actively participated in the struggle.

Why did Tan Tiwu dare to take the lead in frantically attacking the Party by taking advantage of the Party's rectification campaign? It turned out that this was the result of the support and sympathy of several rightists from the RCCK. Regarding this issue, Qu Wu, a member of the Standing Committee of the RCCK Central Committee, revealed that on June 10, he went to Tan Tiwu's house to persuade Tan to accept criticism and admit her mistakes. But Tan flatly stated that she had no mistakes, and said, "There are many people who support and sympathize with me."

Su Congzhou, an alternate member of the RCCK Central Committee and a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee, tore off Tan Tiwu's mask of "utter devotion to the Party." He said that Tan Tiwu had been promoted three times under Huang Shaohong, from clerk to section chief to secretary. She was Huang Shaohong's reactionary partner for twenty years.

During the Anti-Japanese War, she infiltrated the Democratic Revolutionary League. The organization wanted her to work on Huang Shaohong, but she remained loyal to Huang Shaohong. When Li Zongren ran for vice president, Huang Shaohong planned for Li and Tan Tiwu cheered for Li, fully believing that if Li Zongren succeeded, she could rise to prominence. When the Minlian (SanMin Zhuyi Comrades Association) was fighting the enemy most intensely in Shanghai and Nanjing, it suspected that she was leaking secrets to Huang Shaohong, so it forced her to go to Hong Kong. After she arrived in Hong Kong, her reactionary words and deeds became even more blatant, completely speaking with one voice with Huang Shaohong, which aroused great dissatisfaction among democrats, cultural circles, and women's circles in Hong Kong. After liberation, Tan Tiwu still defended Huang Shaohong everywhere. Therefore, Su Congzhou believes that for twenty years, Tan Tiwu has not been utterly devoted to the Party, but utterly devoted to Huang Shaohong. Tan Tiwu did not turn from left to right, but has always been a thorough rightist.

From the two facts revealed by Yu Zhenying and Wu Maosun, members of the Standing Committee of the RCCK Central Committee, before and after liberation, it is even clearer to see Tan Tiwu's "leftist" mask. Yu Zhenying said that in the summer of 1948, the Minlian established a secret political group in the puppet Legislative Yuan, but Tan Tiwu, as a member of this group, exposed all the members of the group to Huang Shaohong. Wu Maosun said that in March and April 1949, after Tan arrived in Beijing from Hong Kong, the organization hoped that she would issue a statement to "draw a clear line between revolution and counter-revolution," but she jumped up and yelled, "What revolution and counter-revolution, Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek are dead, it's still the same..." This is the true content of Tan Tiwu's "utter devotion." Regarding the relationship between Tan Tiwu and the rightist Lin Xiling, which everyone repeatedly asked Tan Tiwu to explain, Zhao Shourui made a forceful revelation. Zhao Shourui said that just as the rightists were launching a frenzied attack on the Party, the rightist Lin Xiling moved into Tan Tiwu's home. On the one hand, she let Lin Xiling's cronies spread rumors in the school that Lin was "persecuted" and "missing"; on the other hand, she gathered some reactionary lackeys from Renmin University and Peking University together to plan in secret rooms, collect intelligence, and direct actions. What was Tan Tiwu doing at home? She quibbled, saying that because she "felt Lin Xiling was suspicious, she wanted to investigate her at home." Zhao Shourui said that this was ridiculous.

On June 8, the People's Daily published an editorial entitled "Why Is This So?" Tan Tiwu immediately instructed Lin Xiling to go to the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to protest. On June 10, before Lin Xiling left Tan's house, Tan Tiwu gave Lin face-to-face struggle tactics, saying, "The direction has shifted somewhat, and you can admit your mistakes when you go back. Bow your head when you should, and stand up when you should."

Zhao Shourui also revealed another thing that Tan Tiwu did to poison young people: Tan Tiwu said to a young student in her family, "Being in this society (referring to the new society) also requires double-dealing. History is like this, this faction and that faction, this party and that party, it is not okay to lean to either faction or party. For example, before liberation, the Kuomintang wanted to kill the heads of the Communists, and now the Communist Party wants to kill the heads of the Kuomintang..." and shamelessly said, "I myself have been able to have positions and power in the past and present because I am a double-dealer. Look how good my life is now!" Then she said her inner thoughts: "If I were not a double-dealer, the Kuomintang would have beheaded me upon their return."

Zhou Fanwen revealed that Tan Tiwu supported the reactionary publication "Guangchang" of Peking University. On June 7, Cui Defu (deputy editor-in-chief of Guangchang), a reactionary student from Peking University, went to Tan Tiwu's home through Lin Xiling's introduction. At that time, Lin Xiling and Huang Shaohong were both present. Tan Tiwu expressed warm welcome to this reactionary element. Cui reported to Tan, Huang, etc., on the situation of the great blooming and great contending at Peking University, as well as the preparations for running "Guangchang." At that time, Tan Tiwu asked Lin to write a note and asked Cui to go to Dongsi Santiao to find a young painter to withdraw 200 yuan, but the money was not received because the painter was not there.

In the face of the numerous facts revealed by everyone, Tan Tiwu adopted a bad attitude of denial, lying, and resistance, which aroused great anger from everyone, and they were determined to fight her resolutely.

    谭惕吾是二十多年的老两面派
    她说：“我自己过去现在由于是两面派，所以过去现在都能有职务有权力。”“如果不是两面派，国民党回来就要杀我的头。”
    本报讯　在7月27日的民革中央小组和北京市委会联席会议上，许多人以有力的事实，彻底揭穿了长期以“左派”的假象掩盖着的右派分子谭惕吾的丑恶面目，一些曾经受谭惕吾蒙蔽、欺骗的人积极地参加了斗争。
    谭惕吾为什么敢于趁党整风之机担任起疯狂向党进攻的急先锋呢？原来这是民革几个右派分子支持和同情的结果。关于这个问题，民革中央常务委员屈武揭发说，6月10日他到谭惕吾的家里劝谭接受批评，承认错误。而谭却一口咬定说她没有错误，并且说：“支持和同情我的人很多。”
    民革中央候补委员、北京市常委苏从周撕破了谭惕吾“对党忠心耿耿”的幌子。他说，谭惕吾在黄绍竑手下由科员而科长而秘书，连升三级。她是黄绍竑二十年如一日的反动伙伴。
    抗日期间，她混进了民主革命同盟，组织上要她做黄绍竑的工作，但她仍然效忠于黄绍竑。李宗仁竞选副总统时，黄绍竑为李出谋定计，谭惕吾为李摇旗呐喊，满以为李宗仁一旦成功，她就可以飞黄腾达。民联（三民主义同志联合会）在上海南京同敌人斗争最紧张的时候，发现她有泄露机密给黄绍竑的嫌疑，才逼着她去香港。她到香港后，反动言行更为露骨，完全和黄绍竑一鼻孔出气，引起在港民主人士、文化界、妇女界的极大不满。解放后，谭惕吾仍然处处袒护黄绍竑。因此苏从周认为二十年来谭惕吾不是对党忠心耿耿，而是对黄绍竑忠心耿耿。谭惕吾不是从左向右转，而从来就是一个彻头彻尾的右派分子。
    从民革中央常委于振瀛、吴茂荪所揭露的解放前后的两件事实，更加可以看清谭惕吾的“左派”假面目。于振瀛说，1948年夏，民联在伪立法院内成立了秘密的政治小组，而作为这个小组成员的谭惕吾却把小组的人全部暴露给黄绍竑。吴茂荪说，1949年3、4月，谭由香港到北京以后，组织上希望她发表一个声明，“划清革命与反革命的界线”时，她竟暴跳如雷地说：“什么革命反革命，毛泽东、蒋介石死了，还不是一样……”这就是谭惕吾“忠心耿耿”的真实内容。对于大家一再要谭惕吾交代的同右派分子林希翎的关系问题，赵寿瑞作了有力的揭发。赵寿瑞说，正当右派分子向党发动疯狂进攻的时候，右派分子林希翎搬到了谭惕吾的家里。一方面让林希翎的党羽在学校造谣说林“受迫害”“失踪”了；另一方面把人民大学和北京大学中的一些反动喽啰，都聚集在一起，策划于密室之中，搜集情报，指挥行动。谭惕吾在家里干些什么呢？她狡辩说，因为“觉得林希翎可疑，要在家考察她”。赵寿瑞说，这是可笑的。
    6月8日人民日报发表了“这是为什么”的社论，谭惕吾立即指示林希翎到中共中央办公厅去提抗议。6月10日当林希翎离开谭家之前，谭惕吾对林面授斗争策略说：“目前方向有所转移，回去有错误可以承认。该低头就低头，到了该起来的时候就起来。”
    赵寿瑞还揭露了谭惕吾另一件毒化青年的事：谭惕吾对她家里的一个青年学生说“处在这种社会（指新社会）也需要两面派。历史就是这样的，这一派那一派，这一党那一党，倒向那一派那一党都不行。比如解放前国民党要杀共产党的头，现在共产党要杀国民党的头，……。”并无耻地说“我自己过去现在由于是两面派，所以过去现在都能有职务有权力，你看我现在的生活多么好呵！”然后她说了内心话：“如果不是两面派，国民党回来就要杀我的头。”
    周范文揭露了谭惕吾支持北大反动刊物“广场”的事。6月7日北大反动学生崔德甫（广场副主编）通过林希翎的介绍到谭惕吾家里去，当时林希翎和黄绍竑都在座，谭惕吾对这个反动分子表示热诚欢迎。崔向谭、黄等汇报了北大大放大鸣情况，以及有关筹办“广场”的事情。当时谭惕吾要林开一条子，叫崔到东四三条找一个青年画家取款二百元，因画家不在，钱未取到。
    在大家揭露出的大量事实面前，谭惕吾采取了抵赖、撒泼、抗拒的恶劣态度，激起了大家极大的愤怒，决心同她坚决斗争。
