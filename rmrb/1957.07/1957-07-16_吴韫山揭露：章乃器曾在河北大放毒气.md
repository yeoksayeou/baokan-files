Wu Yunshan Reveals:
Zhang Naiqi Once Released Poisonous Gas in Hebei

    I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government and fully agree with all other work reports. Premier Zhou's report further inspired the enthusiasm of the people across the country to build socialism, made our direction forward clearer, further strengthened our confidence in taking the socialist road, and made us more clearly aware of the reactionary nature of the right-wing elements, increasing our ideological weapons for fighting against them.

    Since the unfolding of the rectification movement of the Chinese Communist Party, people from all walks of life across the country have responded to the Party's call, putting forward criticisms and suggestions to the Party with good intentions, out of a desire to care for the Party and the cause of socialism. These criticisms and suggestions have been valued and welcomed by the Party. This will play an active and beneficial role in helping the Party overcome shortcomings and mistakes and further strengthen the Party's leadership in building the cause of socialism. This is what the Party needs, and it is also the responsibility we should fulfill to the Party—the Communist Party—the core of national leadership. However, right-wing elements have taken advantage of the opportunity to help the Party in its rectification to launch malicious attacks on the Party and spread anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacies with ulterior motives. Zhang Naiqi is one of the most vicious and insidious among them. Echoing each other, right-wing elements like Zhang Naiqi unscrupulously promoted in industrial and commercial circles: "The bourgeoisie no longer has two sides"; "There is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements"; "Bourgeois elements love socialism even without transformation, and bourgeois elements do not need to undergo fundamental transformation"; "Fixed interest is not exploitation but unearned income." He said, "Socialist enterprises are not as superior as modern capitalist enterprises"; "Bureaucratism is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." He also said that his position and power in the Ministry of Food were obtained through struggle," etc. This shameless method of glorifying the bourgeoisie, uglifying the working class, confusing right and wrong, and reversing black and white is a complete attempt to deny the Party's leadership, refuse the socialist transformation of bourgeois elements, and vainly attempt to achieve his anti-socialist political goals.

    Zhang Naiqi Incites Capitalists to Confront the Working Class

    Zhang Naiqi's anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiratorial activities have been consistent. Whenever there is an opportunity, he engages in large-scale activities to release his political toxins, and the industrial and commercial circles have been greatly harmed by him. Leaving aside the early periods, even after the announcement of our country's general task, his words and deeds clearly reveal his conspiracy. In the winter of 1955, at the enlarged meeting of the executive committee of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, he gave a speech entitled "Settle Down and Raise Your Heads," inciting the industrial and commercial circles. Under the guise of promoting the policy of peaceful transformation, he slandered those who spoke and acted based on Marxist-Leninist theory as dogmatists and scolded those who helped the industrial and commercial circles in their transformation as "dog-headed military advisors." He also said to the industrial and commercial circles: "Raise your heads and don't be inferior," implying that the industrial and commercial circles should confront the working class. This caused dissatisfaction and discontent with the transformation among some industrialists and businessmen with low levels of awareness. He also gave speeches with the same title in Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and other cities in Hebei Province, with the same bad effect. After the overall public-private partnership, he promoted the absurd idea of "red capitalists," saying that "the bourgeoisie no longer has two sides"; "Those who enter socialism with means of production are more glorious than those who shout slogans empty-handed." Although the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) launched a fierce debate on this, the ideological confusion caused in the industrial and commercial circles has not been completely eliminated to this day. After the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, most of the democratic parties promptly issued instructions to study the documents of the Eighth National Congress. Many members of the CDNCA Central Committee in Beijing urged the CDNCA headquarters to issue similar instructions quickly, but Zhang Naiqi, as the vice chairman of the CDNCA Central Committee, rebuked everyone for being "formalistic" and scolded everyone for having "capitalist competitive thinking." This arrogant attitude was extremely infuriating. Since the launch of the Party's rectification movement, Zhang Naiqi has published a series of absurd arguments, causing those who were originally confused by him to sink deeper and become unwilling to continue accepting transformation. Some have even developed to the point of being anti-Party and anti-socialist. For example, in the Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce and in the industrial and commercial circles of Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Qinhuangdao, Handan, and other cities, some people have expressed complete agreement with Zhang Naiqi's arguments, some have vigorously peddled Zhang Naiqi's reactionary capitalist private goods, and some have shamelessly quoted Zhang Naiqi's arguments and adopted Zhang Naiqi's two-faced methods to attack the Party. They said, "After the public-private partnership, the wall between the Party and non-Party members has become higher and higher, and the ditch has become deeper and deeper. The wall was built by the Party, and the ditch was dug by the Party." They said: "In enterprises, the public representatives and staff always emphasize standing firm on the working class's position in everything, always mentioning capitalists, always mentioning transformation, hurting the self-esteem of private personnel and affecting their enthusiasm." They proposed to abolish the title of public representatives in joint ventures, which in essence meant abolishing the public representatives, vainly attempting to achieve their goal of changing our country's fundamental system. They unscrupulously attacked the advanced backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles, saying that the Federation of Industry and Commerce did not represent the legitimate interests of the industrial and commercial circles, slandering the Federation of Industry and Commerce as "just a ladder for the backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles to climb up," and slandering the advanced backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles as people who "stroke their beards, flatter, and brag." Some even blatantly clamored that "Chen Shutong cannot represent the industrial and commercial circles; only Zhang Naiqi can speak for the industrial and commercial circles." More seriously, like Zhang Naiqi, they consciously wanted to portray the United Front Work Department of the Party Committee as a bunch of darkness. They said against their conscience that "the United Front Work Department of the Party Committee is not sufficient in uniting those above and below, those big and small, and only unites men and not women, and the industrial and commercial circles do not know what the United Front Work Department does." They exaggerated the shortcomings of individual Party member cadres into a universal phenomenon, and did everything they could to slander and defame the Party and the Party's leadership, trying to use this to provoke industrialists and businessmen to oppose the Party's leadership.

    Some Industrial and Commercial Figures in Hebei Province Have Been Deeply Poisoned

    Zhang Naiqi's most insidious method is to exploit the weaknesses of the bourgeois thoughts and feelings that actually exist in the industrial and commercial circles to capture the industrial and commercial circles. His absurd arguments have deeply poisoned some industrialists and businessmen with low levels of awareness in our Hebei Province. Some people have completely lost their way, unable to distinguish right from wrong, and in the process of helping the Party in its rectification, they have consciously or unconsciously spoken from a position that deviated from socialism, uttering the same language as Zhang Naiqi. Some backbone elements have even wavered, standing outside the backbone elements and also satirizing progressive elements. From some vice chairmen of our Hebei Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce to ordinary industrialists and businessmen, many people have recently made self-criticisms, saying that they "were fooled by Zhang Naiqi and blindly followed him on a dangerous path for a period of time." Zhang Naiqi also insisted that he did not seek a market in the industrial and commercial circles. Then, what is it that you are swindling and cheating everywhere, peddling poison, if not seeking a market? He also said that his anti-socialist remarks were not harmful. Then, judging from the above situation in our Hebei Province, can it be said that it has nothing to do with Zhang Naiqi's conspiratorial incitement? If it is true, then it can only be said to the anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing ambitious elements. Is there any other explanation?

    What is even more infuriating is that after Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was officially published, Zhang Naiqi still did not show any remorse and insisted on his reactionary position. Moreover, at the plenary meeting of the State Council held on the eve of Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," Zhang Naiqi not only resisted criticism and refused transformation but also more rampantly slandered the Party. Before and during this conference, he turned a deaf ear to the accusations and criticisms made against him by people from all walks of life across the country and people's representatives. He treated the decisions of the CDNCA and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce as child's play. This fully shows that Zhang Naiqi is resisting to the end and cutting himself off from the people!

    We Must Resolutely Fight to the End Against Zhang Naiqi and Other Right-Wing Elements

    I fully agree with the statements of the CDNCA and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce on supporting Premier Zhou's report and resolutely fight to the end against right-wing elements such as Zhang Naiqi.

    Over the past few years, under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, our ideological understanding as industrialists and businessmen has greatly improved. Under the inspiration of the state's redemption policy, more than a year ago, we joyously and enthusiastically implemented the overall public-private partnership and embarked on the road of collectivization, entering the gate of socialism. The Party and the government have been encouraging our enthusiasm in all aspects, politically and economically, so that we can study, work, and accept transformation with peace of mind, in order to smoothly pass through the transition period and finally transform into glorious socialist laborers. The reason why our Chinese national bourgeoisie has such good fortune and such a bright future is precisely because the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, based on the theoretical principles of Marxism-Leninism combined with the two-sided characteristics of our national bourgeoisie itself, have adopted a policy of peaceful transformation. At the same time, the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen are also advancing along this path. They have strengthened their self-transformation and strived for the help of others, transitioning to becoming veritable laborers. However, right-wing elements such as Zhang Naiqi deny the two-sidedness and slander those who analyze the two-sidedness of the national bourgeoisie based on Marxist-Leninist theory as dogmatists, attempting to oppose Marxism-Leninism with revisionism under the guise of opposing dogmatism. They vainly attempt to turn back the wheel of the times, trying to make industrialists and businessmen relax their self-transformation and return to the dead end of capitalism. This is absolutely not allowed by the people of the whole country, and it is also resolutely opposed by us patriotic, socialist-supporting industrialists and businessmen.

    Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" is a shining beacon, illuminating our eyes, illuminating our hearts, making us understand what are the remarks that support the Communist Party and support socialism, and what are the remarks that oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism, and arming our minds. Premier Zhou's solemn criticism of the reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements has given us a guide to action for counterattacking the right-wing attacks. We industrialists and businessmen must listen to Chairman Mao and follow the Communist Party. Although some of our friends in the industrial and commercial circles have been temporarily confused by the right-wing remarks due to their lack of vigilance, I think that after studying Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report, everyone will quickly wake up, draw a clear line with the right-wing elements, and jointly launch an irreconcilable struggle against all conspirators who oppose the Party's leadership and sabotage the socialist cause. We must stand firm on the socialist position and resolutely fight to the end with the right-wing elements, and in the process of fighting against the right-wing elements, we will be tempered and improved, in order to strengthen our self-transformation. Speaking of this, I want to warn those right-wing elements that your ugly faces have been exposed. I urge you to turn back quickly, thoroughly admit your mistakes, repent sincerely, and honestly confess to the people. The people will give you a path to self-renewal. If you still insist on your reactionary position and persist in your delusion, the result will inevitably be self-destruction.

    Finally, let me say one more sentence: Chairman Mao's words are a powerful weapon for building socialism. Let us unite and advance victoriously along the bright road of socialism under Chairman Mao's banner.

### 吴韫山揭露：章乃器曾在河北大放毒气

专栏：

    吴韫山揭露：
    章乃器曾在河北大放毒气
    我衷心拥护周总理关于政府工作的报告，并完全同意其他各项工作报告。周总理的报告，进一步鼓舞了全国人民建设社会主义的积极性，使我们更加明确了前进的方向，进一步坚定了走社会主义道路的信心，并使我们更加清楚的认识了右派分子的反动面目，增加了我们对右派分子进行斗争的思想武器。
    中国共产党的整风运动展开以来，全国各阶层人民响应了党的号召，本着爱护党、爱护社会主义事业的愿望出发，向党善意的提出了批评和建议，受到了党的重视和欢迎。这对于帮助党克服缺点和错误，进一步加强党对建设社会主义事业的领导，将起到积极有益的作用。这是党所需要的，也是我们对国家领导核心的党——共产党应尽的责任。但是，右派分子利用帮助党整风之机，向党发出恶意的攻击，别有用心的散布反党反社会主义的谬论。章乃器即是其中最为恶毒阴险的一个。右派分子章乃器与其他右派分子互相呼应，在工商界中肆无忌惮的宣传：“资产阶级已经没有两面性”；“资产阶级分子与工人阶级分子之间已没有本质的区别”；“资产阶级分子不再改造也爱社会主义，资产阶级分子决不需要脱胎换骨的改造”；“定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获”。他说：“社会主义企业不如现代化的资本主义企业优越”；“官僚主义是比资本主义更加危险的敌人”。他还说，他在粮食部的有职有权是经过斗争得来的”等等。他这种无耻的以美化资产阶级丑化工人阶级，混淆是非，颠倒黑白，阴险毒辣的手法，完全是企图否认党的领导，拒绝对资产阶级分子的社会主义改造，妄想达到其反社会主义的政治目的。
    章乃器煽动资本家向工人阶级分庭抗礼
    章乃器反党反社会主义的阴谋活动是一贯的。只要一有机会，他就大肆活动，放射他的政治毒素，工商界受其毒害很大。过早的暂且不谈，仅就我们国家的总任务公布以后，他的言论和活动中，就可明显的看出他的阴谋。一九五五年冬季他在我们河北省工商联执委扩大会议上曾以“心安下去，头抬起来”为题，向工商界进行煽动。他在宣扬和平改造政策的幌子下，诬蔑根据马列主义理论讲话和办事的人为教条主义者，骂帮助工商界进行改造的人是狗头军师。他并向工商界说：“要抬起头来，不要自卑”，暗示工商界应该向工人阶级分庭抗礼。曾引起一些觉悟水平不高的工商业者对党不满，对改造不满。他在河北省的保定、石家庄等市的工商界中也作过同样题目的讲演，也起到同样坏的作用。全行业公私合营以后，他又宣传“红色资产阶级”的滥调，说什么“资产阶级已没有两面性”；“带着生产资料进入社会主义的人比那些赤手空拳空喊口号的人更光荣”。对此，民建二中全会虽然开展了激烈的争论，但是，在工商界中引起的思想混乱，到现在还未彻底清除。中国共产党的八大会议以后，各民主党派大都及时地发出了学习八大文件的指示，好多在京的民建中央委员催促民建总会赶快发出同样的指示，而身为民建中央副主委的章乃器却斥责大家是“形式主义”，骂大家是“资本主义竞争思想”。他这种不逊的态度，令人十分愤慨。自从党的整风运动开展以来，章乃器又发表了一系列的荒谬论调，使原来受他迷惑的人，陷溺更深，不愿继续接受改造，有的甚至已经发展到反党反社会主义的程度，比如在我们河北省工商联和唐山、石家庄、张家口、保定、秦皇岛、邯郸等市的工商界中，均有人提出完全同意章乃器的论调，有人大肆贩运章乃器的反动的资本主义私货，有的人竟无耻的引用章乃器的论调，采用章乃器的两面手法，向党进攻。他们说什么“公私合营以后，党和非党之间的墙日渐高起来，沟日渐深起来。墙是党垒的，沟是党挖的。”他们说：“公方和职工在企业中，大事小事处处强调站稳工人阶级立场，开口资本家，闭口资本家，开口改造，闭口改造，伤害了私方人员的自尊心，影响了私方人员的积极性。”他们提出：取消合营企业中公方代表的名义，实质上即是撤销公方代表，妄想以此达到其改变我们国家根本制度的目的。他们肆无忌惮的打击工商界的先进骨干分子，说什么工商联没有代表工商界的合法利益，诬蔑工商联“只是工商界骨干分子向上爬的阶梯”，诬蔑工商界的先进骨干分子是“捋须、拍马、吹牛”的人。甚至有的竟明目张胆的叫嚣“陈叔通代表不了工商界，只有章乃器才能代表工商界说话”。更严重的是他们和章乃器一样，有意识的想把党委统战部说成一团黑，他们昧着良心说“党委统战部对上对下，对大对小，统的都很不够，而且是统男不统女，说工商界不知道统战部是干什么的”。他们把个别党员干部的缺点，扩大说成为普遍现象，对党和党的领导，极尽其诬蔑诽谤之能事，想以此来挑拨工商业者反对党的领导。
    河北省一些工商界人士受毒甚深
    章乃器最阴谋的手法是利用工商界实际上存在的资产阶级思想感情的弱点，来俘虏工商界。他的滥调在我们河北省有一些觉悟水平不高的工商界人士，受毒很深。有些人完全迷失了方向，不能辨别是非，在帮助党整风的过程中，自觉不自觉的离开了社会主义立场讲话，发出了与章乃器同样的语言。甚至有的骨干分子，发生了动摇，却站在骨干分子之外，也讽刺进步分子。从我们河北省工商联有的副主委到一般工商业者，近来有好多人自我检讨“上了章乃器的当，盲目的跟他走了一段危险的道路”。章乃器还硬说他没有在工商界找市场，那末，你到处招摇撞骗，贩卖毒品，不是找市场是什么呢？他还说他的反社会主义言论没有危害性，那么就从我们河北省以上情况来看，能够说与章乃器的阴谋煽动无关吗？如果是真的话，那只有是对反党反社会主义的右派野心分子而言，难道还有别的解释吗？
    更令人愤慨的是在毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演正式发表了以后，章乃器仍然没有丝毫悔悟，还是坚持他的反动立场；并且在周总理作“政府工作报告”的前夕所召开的国务院全体会议上，章乃器不仅抗拒批评，拒绝改造，反而更加猖狂地对党大施诬蔑。在我们这次大会以前和大会期间，全国各界人民和人民代表对他提出的指责和批判，他都置若罔闻，他对于民建会和全国工商联组织上的决定当作儿戏。这充分说明章乃器是顽抗到底，自绝于人民！
    我们要坚决同章乃器和其他右派分子斗争到底
    我完全同意民建会和全国工商联关于拥护周总理的报告的声明，坚决同章乃器等右派分子斗争到底。
    我们工商业者几年来，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导教育下，思想认识有了很大的进步，并且在国家的赎买政策的感召下，在一年多以前，欢欣鼓舞的全部实行了公私合营和走上了合作化道路，迈进了社会主义的大门。而且党和政府从政治上、经济上各个方面来鼓舞我们的热情，使我们能够安心学习，安心工作，安心接受改造，以便平平稳稳地走过过渡时期，最后转变成为社会主义的光荣劳动者。我们中国民族资产阶级之所以有这样的幸运，有这样的光明前途，正是由于中国共产党和毛主席根据马克思列宁主义的理论原则结合我们民族资产阶级本身所存在的两面性的特点，采取了和平改造政策的结果。同时，绝大部分工商业者也正是沿着这条道路前进的，他们加强了自我改造，并争取别人的帮助，向着名副其实的劳动者过渡。但是，章乃器等右派分子却否认两面性，诬蔑根据马列主义理论分析民族资产阶级存在两面性的人为教条主义者，企图在反对教条主义的幌子下，以修正主义来反对马列主义。他们妄想扭转时代的车轮，企图使工商业者放松自我改造，再回到资本主义的死路上去。这是全国人民所决不能允许的，也是我们爱国的、拥护社会主义的工商业者所坚决反对的。
    毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，是光芒万丈的指路明灯，照亮了我们的眼睛，照亮了我们的心，使我们懂得了什么是拥护共产党、拥护社会主义的言论，什么是反对共产党、反对社会主义的言论，武装了我们的头脑。周总理对右派分子反动言论的严正批判，更使我们有了反击右派进攻的行动指南。我们工商业者一定要听毛主席的话，跟共产党走。我们工商界当中虽然有一些朋友由于警惕性不高，一时被右派言论所迷惑，我想大家学习了毛主席的讲演和周总理的报告，一定会很快的醒悟过来，与右派分子划清界限，来共同向一切反对党的领导、破坏社会主义事业的阴谋分子，展开不调和的斗争。我们一定要站稳社会主义立场，坚决同右派分子斗争到底，并且在与右派进行斗争中，使自己受到锻炼，得到提高，以加强自我改造。说到这里，我要正告那些右派分子们，你们的鬼脸已经暴露出来，要你们赶快回头，彻底承认错误，痛改前非，向人民老老实实的交代，人民是会给你们以自新之路的。如果仍然坚持反动立场，执迷不悟，其结果必然是自取灭亡。
    最后，再让我说一句，毛主席的话是建设社会主义的有力武器，让我们大家团结起来，在毛主席的旗帜下，沿着社会主义的光明大道胜利前进。
