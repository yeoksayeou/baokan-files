I warmly support Premier Zhou’s and Vice Premiers Li and Bo’s reports, and all the reports made to the conference.

In his report, Premier Zhou used vivid examples to affirm the great achievements in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, pointed out the shortcomings and errors in our work, and sternly and forcefully refuted the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks of the right-wing elements. I want to warn those right-wing elements that China's people's democratic regime and socialist system are the fruits of the Chinese people's nearly century-long anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle, and the result of the Chinese people's decades of bloody sacrifices and heroic struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. It is supported and endorsed by the broad masses and cannot be easily overthrown. The wheel of history will never turn backwards; this is the law of social development. The wild words and absurd arguments of the right-wing elements can only win the applause of American imperialism and the reactionary elements in Taiwan. The Chinese people will never let them go. We must resolutely struggle to the end until their conspiracy is completely crushed. Only in this way can the socialist system be further consolidated, and the cause of socialist construction can proceed smoothly.

In his report to this conference, Vice Premier Bo pointed out that the reduction in cotton cloth production this year is mainly due to the agricultural disasters last year, which resulted in the failure to complete the cotton production plan. Therefore, he proposed that in the future, the state should have the necessary reserves of industrial raw materials such as cotton, under possible conditions, to regulate production and consumption after lean years and reduce fluctuations in social and economic life. I wholeheartedly agree and hope that this measure can be implemented in the future.

Now, I would like to offer some suggestions on how to improve the quality of raw cotton and tap the potential of textile raw material resources.

Due to the influence of natural conditions on agricultural production, cotton harvests fluctuate, which often causes many difficulties for the textile industry in arranging production. Last year, due to natural disasters in most cotton-producing areas, cotton production was greatly reduced, and the maturity of the fiber was poor, the amount of yellow cotton increased, and the quality significantly declined, resulting in a lower average grade of raw cotton this year than in previous years. The quality of raw cotton directly affects the quality of yarn and cloth. Since liberation, the work of improving cotton seeds has been done well, and the length of cotton fiber has increased from 27.6632 inches in 1950 to the current 33.6032 inches. There has also been progress in cotton processing. The amount of Class B impurities (cottonseeds, broken seeds, silt, etc.) in processed raw cotton has gradually decreased, but there are still many small impurities with fibers and short fibers. Textile factories cannot completely remove the knots and impurities, which causes finished products to be downgraded. In order to facilitate the smooth progress of the textile factory's processing technology and improve the quality of yarn and cloth, we must find ways to improve the quality of raw cotton in all aspects.

1.  Cotton Picking: The current practice of "four separations" in rural areas (separate picking, separate storage, separate drying, and separate selling) is beneficial to improving the quality of seed cotton, but it lacks technical guidance and is not thorough enough. Errors often occur in cotton grading. For example, a certain grade of cotton often contains other grades or yellow cotton, which affects the accuracy of cotton allocation in yarn factories.

When agricultural cooperatives assess the work points of cotton pickers, some cooperatives do not consider the quality, but assess points based solely on quantity, prompting members to be greedy for quantity and ignore quality, resulting in more broken branches, leaf debris, and boll fragments in seed cotton.

In some areas, in order to arrange winter plowing early, or to plant grain in cotton fields, cotton stalks are pulled up in advance. For example, in the Xiangyang area of Hubei, about 40% of the total output last year was from cotton stalks pulled up to pick unopened bolls. As a result, the maturity of the cotton was insufficient, and the grade was reduced by one to four grades, which also reduced farmers' income. The result is not worth the loss.

In order to improve cotton picking, relevant departments have done a lot of work in the past. To ensure that it gets on the right track in the future, it is hoped that a special management agency will be designated to study and formulate cotton picking regulations to guide the current cotton picking work, based on the situation in China's rural areas.

2.  Preliminary Cotton Processing: At present, supply and marketing cooperatives are mainly engaged in the preliminary processing of cotton. Some agricultural cooperatives also carry out ginning and sell lint cotton to increase sideline income. The main tools for ginning are saw-tooth and roller cotton gins, which are generally outdated and have weak technical capabilities. Some ginning mills unilaterally pursue the lint yield and abnormally accelerate the speed. For example, under normal circumstances, a power-driven ginning machine should rotate at 800 to 850 revolutions per minute, and the output per machine per hour should be about 150 catties. However, in major cotton-producing areas such as Henan and Hebei, the speed has been increased to 1,000 to 1,200 revolutions, and the output per machine per hour has increased to 180 to 200 catties. Since these areas do not rely on improving technology to increase production, but only seek shortcuts by increasing the speed, the result is often broken cottonseeds, removal of the bottom lint, and a reduction in the quality of the processed raw cotton.

The practice of removing the bottom lint from cottonseeds like shaving a bald head, as pointed out in the "Experimental Report on the Amount of Surplus Lint Yield and Bottom Lint from Power-Driven Processing" issued by the Commercial Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Supervision on February 14 this year: "The surplus lint yield that the procurement system fraudulently obtains due to poor processing becomes their 'excellent processing' added value. However, for the textile system, it spends more state funds to buy short fibers that have no textile value and brings difficulties to the textile process and increases the loss of fly waste." Due to the harm of short fibers, the opening and cleaning and carding processes in yarn factories increase the amount of fly waste and reduce the production rate. In the spinning process, short fibers form a floating state, which destroys normal drafting and causes uneven yarn evenness. Moreover, because short fibers have poor cohesion and are easy to slip off, they affect the strength of the yarn.

Crushing cottonseeds will increase the amount of small impurities with fibers in the raw cotton, which is very unfavorable to the textile process, because the impurities are small and have fibers, which are easily entangled with other fibers and are not easy to remove, causing thick and thin spots in the yarn and reducing the strength. Poor yarn will also increase the defects in the cloth, and dyeing will also produce uneven dyeing and streaks due to impurities that cannot be completely removed.

Therefore, from a national perspective, the unreasonable production increase methods of ginning mills will cause losses to the country. As pointed out in the experimental report of the Commercial Supervision Bureau: if the amount of cottonseed bottom lint in every 100 catties of lint cotton processed by power-driven machines, which accounts for half of the country's cotton production, is reduced by 0.05%, it can reduce bottom lint by 630,000 dan. Just the waste of transportation capacity alone can save the country 1,050 train cars.

We hope that the department in charge of preliminary cotton processing can agree with us on the quality requirements of raw cotton, because when various impurities and unopened bolls have not yet been mixed with lint cotton, they are only attached to the outer layer of the cotton and are easy to separate and remove. If we pay more attention to machine maintenance and ensure that the operating conditions are normal, then we will not crush cottonseeds or remove the bottom lint, or at least we can greatly reduce this phenomenon. If a ginning mill crushes one less cottonseed or removes one more infertile seed, the yarn factory can reduce hundreds of small impurities that need to be removed. Therefore, in terms of removing impurities, ginning mills can achieve twice the result with half the effort, which is much more cost-effective than the yarn factory's half the result with twice the effort. We hope that the preliminary cotton processing department can cooperate well with us and work together to economically and rationally utilize national resources. To this end, I suggest:

1.  Organize relevant departments to jointly study and formulate ginning process regulations, and reasonably stipulate the lint yield, impurity content, and short fiber rate.
2.  Improve ginning technology and ginning equipment.
3.  Implement a reward system of higher prices for higher quality, as an incentive to improve the quality of raw cotton in terms of processing technology.
4.  Encourage and promote technical cooperation between ginning mills and textile factories, with textile technicians helping ginning mills improve their technical work. Textile factories in some areas have carried out this work and it has been well received and has achieved good results.

5.  Utilization of Cottonseed Lint: Under the guidance of the principle of "building the country diligently and thriftily," we should study and tap the potential of national resources in all aspects. For example, I mentioned earlier that cottonseed bottom lint is very harmful to the textile process, but this does not mean that cottonseed lint is waste. If handled properly, it is a wealth that benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood, because it is an excellent raw material for man-made fibers and also a raw material for papermaking. It can also be used for wadding, nitrocellulose, sanitary cotton, etc. According to Soviet data, 5% of short fibers can be stripped from every 100 catties of ginned cottonseeds. If calculated based on the amount of lint cotton produced in my country last year, then about 2.89 million dan of short fibers can be stripped from cottonseeds. This can not only be exchanged for part of the civil wadding for spinning to supplement the shortage of raw cotton, but also provide good raw materials for the future development of man-made fibers. In addition, stripping the short fibers from the cottonseeds can also increase the oil yield of cottonseed oil pressing (to prevent the oil from being absorbed by the short fibers), which is beneficial and harmless.

It is recommended that the state pay attention to the utilization of short fibers, designate a special management unit to study and take measures to implement it, and lay the foundation for the development of the man-made fiber industry to meet the needs of the broad consumer base.

Please criticize the above three points if there are any inappropriate places.

    从各方面提高原棉质量
    张琴秋的发言
    我热烈拥护周总理与李、薄副总理的报告，和为大会所作的各项报告。
    总理的报告中，用活生生的事例肯定了社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的伟大成就，指出了工作中的缺点和错误，并且严正有力地批驳了右派分子反党、反社会主义的言论。我要警告那些右派分子，我国人民民主政权、社会主义制度是中国人民经过近百年来反帝反封建的革命斗争，是中国人民在中国共产党领导下，经过数十年流血牺牲、英勇奋斗所换得来的果实，它为广大群众所支持和拥护，决不是轻易能够推翻的。历史的车轮决不会往后倒退，这就是社会发展的规律。右派分子的狂言谰语，只能博得美帝和台湾反动分子的喝彩，中国人民决不会放过他们的，一定要坚决斗争到底，一直到彻底粉碎他们的阴谋为止。只有这样，社会主义制度才能更加巩固，社会主义的建设事业才能顺利进行。
    薄副总理在这次大会上的报告中指出，今年纱布减产主要是由于去年农业遭受灾害，棉花没有完成生产计划所致，因而提出今后国家对于棉花等工业原料，在可能条件下要有必要数量的储备，以调剂歉年之后的生产和消费，减少社会经济生活的波动。我衷心表示赞成，并且希望今后能实现这个措施。
    现在，我想在关于如何提高原棉质量和挖掘纺织原料资源的问题，提出几点意见。
    由于农业生产受着自然条件的影响，棉花收成时好时坏，使纺织工业在安排生产上常发生很多困难。去年由于大部产棉区遭受了自然灾害，棉花大大地减产，而且纤维成熟度差、黄花增多、质量显著下降，致使今年的原棉平均品级比过去几年都要低。原棉质量的好坏，直接影响到纱布的质量。解放几年来由于对改良棉种的工作做得较好，棉纤维的长度已从一九五○年的27.6632英寸提高到目前的33.6032英寸。棉花加工方面也有进步，加工后的原棉中，乙类杂质（棉籽、破籽、泥沙等）已逐渐减少，但是带纤维的细小杂质和短绒等还很多，纺织厂因棉结杂质清除不尽造成成品降级。为了有利于纺织厂加工工艺的顺利进行和提高纱布质量，必须设法从各方面来提高原棉质量。
    一、棉花采摘方面：当前农村实行分摘、分存、分晒、分卖的四分法，这对改进籽棉质量是有好处的，但是缺乏技术指导，做得尚不够彻底，棉花分级中常出现差错，例如某种品级棉花中，常混入其他品级或黄花，这就会影响纱厂配棉方面的正确性。
    农业合作社在评定采棉工分时，有的社不管质量好坏，一律按数量评分，促使社员贪多图快，追求数量而忽视质量，结果增加了籽棉中的碎枝、叶屑和铃片。
    有的地区为了提早布置冬耕，或将棉田翻种粮食而提前拔掉棉株，例如湖北襄阳专区，去年拔秆剥桃棉约占总产量的百分之四十，棉花因之成熟度不足，降低品级一——四级，农民的收入也因此减少，这样做的结果是得不偿失的。
    为了改进棉花的采摘工作，有关部门在过去已做了不少工作，为使今后更能步入正轨，希望能根据我国农村情况指定专管机关，研究并制订采棉规程，以指导当前采棉工作。
    二、棉花初步加工方面：目前经营棉花初步加工的主要是供销合作社，有的农业合作社为增加副业收入，也进行轧花，出售皮棉。轧花主要工具是锯齿与皮辊轧花机，一般说都是设备陈旧、技术力量薄弱。尚有部分轧花厂因为片面追求衣分，而不正常地加快了车速，例如在正常情况下，动力轧花机每分钟应该是八百至八百五十转，每一台时产量是一百五十斤左右，而目前在河南、河北等主要产棉区，车速已被提高到一千至一千二百转，每一台时产量增加到一百八十至二百斤。由于这些地区不是依靠改进技术来增加产量，而是只从提高车速上找窍门，所以结果常常是轧碎棉籽、啃掉底绒，降低了加工后原棉的质量。
    像剃光头似地啃掉棉籽底绒的做法，正如监察部商业监察局今年二月十四日“关于动力加工盈余衣分和底绒多少的试验报告”中指出：“采购系统因加工不良而虚盈的衣分，成为他们‘加工优良’的增值，在纺织系统来说，却多花了国家资金买进毫无纺织价值的短绒，还给纺织工艺上带来困难和增加落棉量的损失。”由于短绒的危害，使纱厂清花、钢丝工序增加落棉量，降低制成率；在纺纱过程中短绒形成浮游状态，破坏正常牵伸，造成条干不匀；而且因为短绒抱合力差，容易滑脱，影响到纱的强力。
    轧碎棉籽，就会在原棉中增加带纤维的细小杂质，这对纺织工艺是很不利的，因为杂质细小，且带纤维，容易与其他纤维纠缠在一起，不易除去，使成纱发生粗细节，强力减退；成纱不良，也就会增加布的疵点，漂染方面也会因杂质除不尽而产生染色不匀、条花等现象。
    因此，从全国范围说，轧花厂不合理的增产办法会给国家造成损失的。按商业监察局试验报告中指出：占全国棉产量半数由动力机加工的原棉，如果每百斤皮棉中减少棉籽底绒百分之零点五，则可减少底绒六十三万担，单就运输能力的浪费，就可为国家节约一千零五十个车皮。
    我们希望棉花初步加工的主管部门，对原棉质量要求的看法能与我们取得一致，因为各种杂质和僵瓣还没有和皮棉混轧在一起时，只附在棉花的外层，容易分离，容易清除。如果多注意一些机器保全、保养，使运转情况能够处于正常状态，则不致轧碎棉籽，啃掉底绒，或至少可以大大减轻这种现象。轧花厂少轧碎一颗棉籽或多清除掉一粒不孕籽，纱厂就可以减少百余粒需要清除的细小杂质。因此在清除杂质方面说，轧花厂可以收事半功倍之效，比较纱厂的事倍功半不知要合算多少倍。希望棉花初步加工部门能与我们很好合作，共同为经济、合理地利用国家资源而努力。为此，我建议：
    1．组织有关部门，共同研究制定轧花工艺规程，合理规定衣分率、含杂率与短绒率。
    2．改进轧花技术和轧花设备。
    3．实行优质优价的奖励制度，作为加工技术上提高原棉质量的鼓励。
    4．鼓励和推行轧花厂和纺织厂的技术合作，由纺织技术人员帮助轨花厂改进技术工作。有些地区的纺织厂曾进行过这一工作，很受欢迎，效果良好。
    三、棉籽绒利用方面：在“勤俭建国”的方针指导下，应该研究从各方面来挖掘国家资源利用的潜力，例如前面我曾提到棉籽底绒对纺织工艺有很大害处，但是这并不等于说棉籽绒是废物，如若处理得当，却是一项有利于国计民生的财富。因为它是人造纤维的优良原料，也是造纸的原料，同时又可用做絮棉、硝化棉、卫生棉等。根据苏联的资料，轧花后的棉籽，每百斤可以剥取短绒百分之五，如果以我国去年所产皮棉量计算，则可从棉籽上剥取短绒二百八十九万担左右，这不仅可以换回部分民用絮棉供纺纱用，以补充原棉的不足，而且还可为今后发展人造纤维提供良好的原料。另外，棉籽上的短绒剥净，还可提高棉籽榨油的出油率（油免被短绒吸去），这是有百利而无一弊的。
    建议国家对短绒的利用加以重视，指定专管单位来研究，并采取措施加以实现，为人造纤维工业的发展打下基础，以满足广大消费者的需要。
    以上三点意见，如有不妥之处，请大家批评。
