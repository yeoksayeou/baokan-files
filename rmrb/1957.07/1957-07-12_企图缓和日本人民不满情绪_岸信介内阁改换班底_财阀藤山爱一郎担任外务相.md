Xinhua News Agency report: According to Xinhua News Agency, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet formally announced its reorganization on the evening of the 10th. The new cabinet was sworn in at the same time.

Kishi Nobusuke succeeded Tanzan Ishibashi as Prime Minister of Japan in February of this year. Most of the members of the Ishibashi Cabinet were not changed. In this cabinet reshuffle, Kishi Nobusuke replaced most of the cabinet members, with the aim of easing the people's opposition to his policies by changing personnel and strengthening the leadership position of the Kishi Nobusuke faction in the cabinet.

In the reorganized cabinet, Kishi Nobusuke continues to serve as Prime Minister; Mitsujiro Ishii continues as Deputy Prime Minister and concurrently serves as Director-General of the Hokkaido Development Agency and Director-General of the Administrative Management Agency. Aiichiro Fujiyama, a giant in the business world (Chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry) who has the closest relationship with Kishi Nobusuke, serves as Foreign Minister.

The selection of the Minister of Finance, which had caused controversy, was finally decided to be Naoto Ichimanda, former Minister of Finance in the Hatoyama Cabinet. Hayato Ikeda, who insisted on continuing as Minister of Finance, did not participate in the new cabinet because he refused to accept the position of Director-General of the Defense Agency that Kishi Nobusuke gave him.

Other important members of the new cabinet are: Minister of International Trade and Industry: Shigemitsu Maeo (former Deputy Chairman of the Policy Research Council of the former Liberal Party), Minister of Justice: Toshiki Karasawa (former Vice Minister of the former Ministry of Home Affairs and Director-General of the Legislation Bureau), Director-General of the Defense Agency: Juichi Tsushima (former Minister of Finance and Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan), Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency: Ichiro Kono (former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Hatoyama Cabinet), Chief Cabinet Secretary: Kiichi Aichi (former Minister of International Trade and Industry).

Prior to the cabinet reshuffle, the leading cadres of the Liberal Democratic Party were also changed. Secretary-General was assumed by Shojiro Kawashima of the Kishi Nobusuke faction, former Secretary-General Takeo Miki became Chairman of the Policy Research Council, Shigemasu Sunada continued to serve as Chairman of the General Affairs Council, and Kazuo Miura became Chairman of the Organization Committee.

After being sworn in, the new cabinet held its first meeting. After the meeting, Kishi Nobusuke issued a statement saying that the new cabinet would make special efforts to conduct "eternal cooperation" with the United States and implement "economic cooperation" with Southeast Asian countries.

In terms of domestic affairs, Kishi Nobusuke also made many promises. He hoped that the new cabinet could eliminate the "three evils" of corruption, violence, and poverty. He also said that he would quickly reverse the imbalance in international payments and formulate a long-term economic plan.

Kishi Nobusuke stated that he did not plan to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet in July and did not intend to hold a general election this year.

The Japan Socialist Party issued a statement on the evening of July 10, believing that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet's reorganization had established a typical conservative regime with a prominent reactionary color. The Socialist Party's statement pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's anti-communist attitude, anti-Asian, pro-American foreign policy, and negative attitude towards Japan-China trade will not be changed in the slightest by the appointment of Aiichiro Fujiyama, a representative of monopoly capitalists, as Foreign Minister. The statement said that looking at other cabinet members, one can only conclude that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is prepared to implement increasingly severe anti-constitutional, reactionary suppression policies and police policies.

The Socialist Party accused Kishi Nobusuke of shifting the responsibility for the Japanese economic crisis to former Finance Minister Hayato Ikeda alone, believing that the entire Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet was responsible and should therefore hold a general election or resign en masse. The Socialist Party also accused Kishi Nobusuke of attempting to continue to implement the failed fiscal policy with the help of the new Minister of Finance, Naoto Ichimanda, and using deflationary policies to protect large capitalists and shift the burden to working people and small and medium-sized enterprises.

Yoshio Shiga, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out on the 11th that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet, composed of bureaucrats and war criminals, will embark on a path of further deepening Japan's subordination to the United States. Shiga said that especially the fact that Toshiki Karasawa, who was the head of the police during the war, was appointed Minister of Justice proves that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet will implement a policy of strengthening the suppression of the working class and the Japanese people. He stated that the Japanese Communist Party will demand that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet convene an extraordinary session of the Diet and dissolve the Diet to hold a general election.

    企图缓和日本人民不满情绪
    岸信介内阁改换班底
    财阀藤山爱一郎担任外务相
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：日本岸信介内阁10日晚间正式宣布改组。新的内阁同时宣誓就职。
    岸信介在今年2月接替石桥湛山担任了日本首相，石桥内阁的大部分阁员没有更动。岸信介在这次改组内阁中更换了大部分阁员，其目的是想用更换人事的办法来缓和人民对他的政策的反对，并加强岸信介派在内阁中的领导地位。
    在改组后的内阁中，岸信介继续担任首相；石井光次郎继任副首相，并且兼任北海道开发厅长官和行政管理厅长官。同岸信介关系最密切的实业界巨头（日本商工会议所会长）藤山爱一郎担任外务相。
    曾经引起争执的藏相人选最后决定由前鸠山内阁藏相一万田尚登担任。坚持要连任藏相的池田勇人由于拒绝接受岸信介给他的防卫厅长官的职位，没有参加新内阁。
    新内阁的其他重要阁员是：通商产业相：前尾繁三郎（曾任前自由党政务调查会副会长），法务相：唐泽俊树（曾任前内务省次官和法制局长），防卫厅长官：津岛寿一（曾任藏相和日本银行副总裁），经济企划厅长官：河野一郎（前鸠山内阁农林相），内阁官房长官：爱知揆一（曾任通商产业相）。
    在改组内阁以前，自由民主党的领导干部也作了更动。干事长由岸信介派的川岛正次郎担任，原来的干事长三木武夫担任政务调查会长，总务会长继续由砂田重政担任，组织委员长由三浦一雄担任。
    新内阁在宣誓就职后举行第一次会议。会后，岸信介发表谈话说，新内阁特别要努力同美国进行“永恒的合作”，同东南亚各国实行“经济合作”。
    在内政方面，岸信介又许下了许多诺言。他希望新内阁能够扫除贪污、暴力和贫困这“三恶”。他还说要迅速扭转国际收支的不平衡状态，拟订长期的经济计划。
    岸信介表示在7月内不准备召开国会临时会议，在今年内不打算举行大选。
    日本社会党7月10日晚上发表声明，认为岸信介内阁这次改组，是建立了一个反动色彩突出的、典型的保守政权。社会党的声明指出，岸信介所抱的反共态度和反亚洲的、追随美国的外交政策，以及对日中贸易所采取的消极态度，丝毫也不会因为垄断资本家的代表——藤山爱一郎的出任外相而有所改变。声明说，看一下其它阁员，也只能认为岸信介内阁已经作好准备，它将日益严厉地执行反宪法的、反动的镇压政策和警察政策。
    社会党指责岸信介把引起日本经济危机的责任推卸给前藏相池田勇人一人，认为岸信介整个内阁都有责任，因此应该举行大选或者总辞职。社会党还指责岸信介企图借助新任藏相一万田尚登继续执行已经遭到失败的财政政策，利用通货紧缩政策来保卫大资本家，把负担转嫁给劳动人民和中小企业。
    日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会委员志贺义雄11日指出，由官僚和战犯组成的岸信介内阁将走上进一步加深日本从属于美国的道路。志贺说，尤其是由战时做过警察头子的唐泽俊树来当法务大臣这件事，证明岸信介内阁将实行加强对工人阶级和日本人民的镇压政策。他表示，日本共产党将要求岸信介内阁召开国会临时会议，并且解散国会来举行大选。
