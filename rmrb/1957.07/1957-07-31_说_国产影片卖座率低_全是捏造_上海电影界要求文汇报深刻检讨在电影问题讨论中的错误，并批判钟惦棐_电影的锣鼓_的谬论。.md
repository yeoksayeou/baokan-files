Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 29th: The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Film Workers' Federation convened a symposium on July 26th and 27th, gathering representatives from all aspects of the Shanghai film industry, to expose and refute the serious errors in the Wenhui Daily's film discussion and the fallacies in the article "The Drumbeat of Cinema" by Zhong Dianfei, a commentator for the Literary Gazette.

Many film workers present unanimously condemned: In the discussion "Why Are There So Few Good Domestic Films?" initiated by Wenhui Daily last November, many articles viciously slandered the people's film industry and completely negated the significant achievements made by the Party's leadership in the film industry since liberation. Its essence was a rampant attack on the people's film industry under the leadership of the Party, attempting to guide the post-liberation film industry onto the capitalist road. Speakers at the meeting demanded that Wenhui Daily must conduct a profound self-examination, confess its crimes to the people, and redeem the negative impact it has created among the people of the country.

In the film discussion, Wenhui Daily portrayed domestic films as having poor attendance and low quality, thus not welcomed by audiences. At the meeting, Hu Zhifan, manager of the Shanghai Film Distribution Company, cited many facts to refute this. He said: Since liberation, the film industry has made great progress. Shanghai had only fifty screening units in 1949, but by 1956, it had grown to one hundred and sixty-six. The number of moviegoers in 1956 had increased by 226.8% compared to 1950. Comparing the largest cinema in Shanghai, the Grand Cinema, its highest annual attendance before liberation was 1.1 million, but now it has increased to 2.47 million.

Hu Zhifan said: According to the highest attendance records of previous film weeks, the French Film Week, with the highest attendance among capitalist countries' films, had an attendance rate of only 89.7%; while the Shanghai Film Studio's New Film Exhibition Week held in Shanghai this year reached an attendance rate of 93.8%. Looking at the most popular films among audiences, "Railway Guerrilla" had a 100% attendance rate in Shanghai, "The Family" had 99.9%, and "Mother" had 99.2%; while the popular French film "The Valiant Adventures of Till Eulenspiegel" among capitalist countries had an attendance rate of 96.3%, and "No Room to Rent" had an attendance rate of 82.4%. He said: The number of domestic films is also considerable. Shanghai screened forty-eight new domestic films in 1956 alone, compared to eighteen films from various capitalist countries. Hu Zhifan questioned Wenhui Daily: Don't these facts demonstrate the tremendous achievements made by the people's film industry under the leadership of the Party since liberation?

Many film workers refuted at the symposium: In many articles in Wenhui Daily, the lowest attendance rates of some domestic films were cited to illustrate that domestic films do not have high attendance rates, or general domestic films were compared with the highest-grossing French film "The Valiant Adventures of Till Eulenspiegel" from capitalist countries to conclude that domestic films are of low quality, have poor attendance, and are not welcomed by audiences. This is extremely one-sided and unfair.

At the meeting, directors Chen Xihe and Ying Yunwei, and screenwriter Li Tianji also severely criticized Zhong Dianfei's fallacies in "The Drumbeat of Cinema" on issues such as "worker-peasant-soldier films," "administrative leadership replacing artistic leadership," and "film tradition." Director Zheng Junli pointed out: Zhong Dianfei's so-called "respect for the artistic tradition of film is actually expressed as a view of people" is a malicious argument. He said that Zhong Dianfei's intention was to slander the film leadership in recent years for cutting off the film tradition and "disrespecting" artists, portraying this as a result of "sectarianism." This argument, on the surface, uses the guise of "caring for people," but is actually a vicious conspiracy to direct the spearhead at the film leadership. Everyone expressed great indignation at Zhong Dianfei's words and deeds in this film discussion.

At the meeting, many film workers also used their experiences in the old and new societies to refute the lies of right-wing elements who negated the achievements of the Party's leadership in the film industry, citing a large number of facts from the development of the film industry, the training of new forces, and the improvement of technical equipment.

The symposium will continue.

    说“国产影片卖座率低”全是捏造
    上海电影界要求文汇报深刻检讨在电影问题讨论中的错误，并批判钟惦棐“电影的锣鼓”的谬论。
    新华社上海29日电　上海电影工作者联谊会筹备委员会26、27日召集上海电影界各方面代表举行座谈会，对文汇报电影问题讨论中的严重错误和文艺报评论员钟惦棐的“电影的锣鼓”一文中的谬论，进行了揭发和驳斥。
    到会的许多电影工作者一致指斥：文汇报去年11月发起的“为什么好的国产片这样少”的讨论中，有许多文章对人民电影事业恶毒地加以污蔑，一笔抹煞解放后党对电影事业领导所取得的重大成就，其实质是在向党领导的人民电影事业进行猖狂的进攻，企图把解放后的电影事业引导到资本主义道路上去。在会上发言的人要文汇报必须作深刻检查，向人民认罪，挽回已经在全国人民中造成的恶劣影响。
    文汇报在电影问题讨论中，曾把国产片说成上座率不好，质量不高，因此观众不欢迎。会上，上海市电影放映公司经理胡治藩列举了许多事实，加以反驳。他说：解放以来，电影事业有很大的发展。上海1949年只有五十个放映单位，1956年就发展到一百六十六个。观众的人次1956年已经比1950年增长226.8％。如拿上海最大的大光明电影院来比较，解放前最高一年观众人次是一百一十万，现在却增加到二百四十七万。
    胡治藩说：根据历次举行电影周最高的上座率记录来看，资本主义国家影片中上座率最高的法国电影周，上座率只有89.7％；而今年在上海举行的上影新片展览周的上座率，就达93.8％。再拿观众最喜爱的几部影片来看，“铁道游击队”在上海放映的上座率是100％，“家”是99.9％，“母亲”是99.2％；而观众喜爱的资本主义国家中的法国影片“勇士的奇遇”的上座率是96.3％，“没有留下地址”的上座率是82.4％。他说：国产片的数量也是不少的。上海在1956年一年放映的国产新片就有四十八部，各资本主义国家的影片为十八部。胡治藩质问文汇报：这些事实难道不是说明解放后党领导的人民电影事业获得的巨大成就吗？
    不少电影工作者在座谈会上驳斥说：在文汇报的许多文章中，列举了一些国产片上座率最低的例子，来说明国产片上座率不高，或者把一般的国产片与资本主义国家卖座最高的法国影片“勇士的奇遇”对比，以此得出国产片质量不高、上座率情况不好、观众不欢迎的结论，这是极端片面和不公正的。
    在这个会上，导演陈西禾、应云卫，编导李天济等还严厉地批驳了钟惦棐在“电影的锣鼓”一文中，对“工农兵电影”、“行政领导代替艺术领导”、“电影传统”等问题发表的谬论。导演郑君里指出：钟惦棐所谓的“尊重电影的艺术传统实际表现成为对人的看法”是一种恶毒的论调。他说，钟惦棐的用意是想污蔑近年来电影领导隔断电影传统，对艺术家“不尊重”，把这说成是“宗派主义”的结果。这种论调表面上打着“关心人”的幌子，实际上是把矛头指向电影领导的一种毒辣阴谋。大家对钟惦棐在这次电影问题讨论中的言行，表示极大愤慨。
    会上，许多电影工作者还以他们在新旧社会的经历，从电影事业的发展，新生力量的培养，技术设备的改进等方面，列举大量事实，驳斥了右派分子抹煞党领导电影事业的成就的谎言。
    座谈会还将继续举行。
