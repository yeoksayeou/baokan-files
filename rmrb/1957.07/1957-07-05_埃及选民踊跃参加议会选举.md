Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 4th. The Egyptian National Assembly elections were completed on time at 5:00 PM on July 3rd in 269 constituencies.

Vote counting began this morning. The election results will be announced later today.

Voters were very enthusiastic. Early in the morning of the 3rd, long lines formed in front of polling stations. The vast majority of constituencies across the country were peaceful, with only a few places experiencing clashes between voters.

In Cairo, women appeared particularly active. Egyptian women, who were voting for the first time, walked along the long queues in front of the polling stations, striving to promote the platforms of their candidates. Among the thousand-plus candidates, there were five female candidates who campaigned with their own slogans, such as abolishing polygamy and relaxing the conditions for women's marriage. Of the approximately six million voters in Egypt, about two hundred thousand are women.

Male voters are required to participate in the vote. Male voters who do not participate without a valid reason will be fined one Egyptian pound or imprisoned for ten days.

Egyptian President Nasser did not participate in the vote because there was only one candidate in his constituency. According to regulations, this constituency did not need to hold an election, and the only candidate was automatically elected. This candidate is the Egyptian Minister of Interior, Mohieddin.

Constituencies where no candidate obtained an absolute majority of votes in the July 3rd vote will hold a second round of voting on July 14th. The five constituencies without a qualified candidate will hold elections at a later date.

    埃及选民踊跃参加议会选举
    新华社开罗4日电　埃及国民议会选举3日下午五点钟在二百六十九个选区中按时完成。
    今天上午开始点票。选举结果将在今天晚些时候发表。
    投票者很踊跃。3日一清早投票站前就排了长长的行列。全国绝大多数选区都平静无事，只有少数地方曾发生选民冲突事件。
    在开罗，妇女们显得特别积极。第一次获得选举权的埃及妇女沿着排在投票站前的长列队伍走来走去，竭力宣传她们的候选人的主张。在一千多个候选人中，妇女候选人共有五人，她们以自己的口号竞选，例如废除一夫多妻制和放宽妇女婚姻的条件。在埃及大约六百万选民中，妇女选民大约有二十万人。
    男选民必须参加投票。无故不参加投票的男选民要罚款一埃镑或受十天监禁处分。
    埃及总统纳赛尔没有参加投票，因为他所属的选区只有一个候选人，按照规定，这个选区不必进行选举，唯一的候选人自然当选。这个候选人就是埃及内政部长毛希丁。
    在3日的投票中没有任何候选人取得绝对多数票的选区将在7月14日举行第二次投票。没有一个合格候选人的五个选区将在更晚些时候进行选举。
