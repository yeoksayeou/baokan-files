    Selling Capitalist Goods Under the Guise of "Anti-Dogmatism"
    Qian Weichang is a Broker for the Zhang-Luo Alliance in the Scientific Community
    (Our Dispatch) Tsinghua University convened a large meeting on the 13th to criticize the rightist Qian Weichang, vice president of Tsinghua University. In addition to the faculty, students and staff of Tsinghua University, many representatives from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, and various schools in Beijing attended the meeting. The Great Auditorium, many classrooms, and the large lawn in front of the auditorium were filled with people. At the same time, the faculty, students, and staff of Peking University also listened to the live broadcast of the meeting on campus.
    Today's meeting was presided over by Chen Shihua, Vice President of Tsinghua University, and Liu Bing, Deputy Secretary of the Tsinghua University Party Committee. Chen Shihua first made a brief speech, followed by the fifth self-criticism by the rightist Qian Weichang. During his speech, notes were constantly passed to the stage demanding that he honestly and thoroughly confess.
    Subsequently, many professors, students, and staff members exposed and criticized Qian Weichang's anti-Party leadership and anti-socialist remarks and actions at the meeting. They focused on Qian Weichang's acts of inciting discord between the Party and senior intellectuals, opposing the leadership of the Party, opposing the socialist education policy and system, negating the achievements of teaching reform, advocating a capitalist education system, plotting an anti-socialist scientific program, and instigating a large-scale signature campaign demanding the merger of science and engineering universities.
    Professor Zhang Zigao cited facts to illustrate the Party's care and respect for senior intellectuals, refuting Qian Weichang's fallacies of inciting discord between the Party and senior intellectuals.
    Professor Zhang Zigao said: On May 17, the People's Daily published an interview with Qian Weichang entitled "Qian Weichang Speaks Earnestly About Contradictions" to a Xinhua News Agency reporter. Qian Weichang created many contradictions there. The first was the contradiction between Party members and non-Party members. He believed that not only was this the case at Tsinghua, but the underestimation of the role and enthusiasm of older professors was a widespread and serious problem in universities across the country. He also cited the case of Mr. Liang Sicheng as an example. Later, Mr. Liang's article on his understanding of the rectification campaign was published, and everyone saw that Mr. Liang was still very active and supported the Party. Now I want to ask you what your intentions were at the time? Were you trying to win over some people to testify for you? The Party has repeatedly encouraged me to take charge of the research work on the history of Chinese chemistry. When I was ill, Party members and Youth League members took care of me, which made me grateful to the point of tears. Later, Principal Jiang and Vice Principal Liu also came to my home to express their condolences. Is this not showing concern? As far as I know, Mr. Chen Yuan of Beijing Normal University and Mr. Tang Yongtong of Peking University have both received high academic respect and very thoughtful care when they were ill. Recently, two old classmates, both around seventy years old, came to see me. They work at Anhui Institute of Mining and are both working with great enthusiasm. Is this not a manifestation of enthusiasm? Take you, Qian Weichang, as an example. Isn't your position and honor much higher than before liberation? Can you still say that the Party underestimates your role?
    After Qian Weichang became the vice president, he opposed the president. Qian Weichang brought out the old Tsinghua to oppose the new Tsinghua, generally believing that the present is not as good as the past. The new Tsinghua is different from the old Tsinghua. The new Tsinghua inherited some good traditions, criticized some bad habits, and cultivated a new force. The student surpasses the teacher, and each generation surpasses the previous one. This is the phenomenon of development. I love the old Tsinghua, and I especially love the new Tsinghua. Qian Weichang, on the other hand, thinks that this is not good and that is not right. What are your intentions?
    Qian Weichang also said that another route is faster than it (referring to the Party's work). This is his anti-Party route, which is the capitalist route, to race against the Party's route, which is the socialist route. Of course, he cannot openly propose this. He always uses deceptive tactics, changing the soup but not the medicine, with one set of rhetoric on the surface and another set at heart, to achieve his goals.
    On the issue of the scientific system, Qian Weichang, as a member of the Science Planning Commission, took advantage of the Party's trust in him to take out the contents of the commission's suggestions on science planning. Under the direction of Zhang Bojun, he and other rightists, such as Zeng Zhaolun and Fei Xiaotong, greatly tampered with it, adding some bourgeois toxins, as suggestions from the China Democratic League working group. They did not want the Party's leadership in scientific research, they did not want scientific research to be planned, they did not want scientific research to be combined with the needs of our country's current production and construction, and they did not want to conduct political and ideological education for the new scientific research forces. This is an anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific program.
    On January 7, Guangming Daily published Qian Weichang's talk on teaching plans and training objectives, which essentially negated the policy of learning from the Soviet Union and the achievements of teaching reform in general. In terms of teaching links, it negated production internships and graduation designs, and ignored the significance of professional courses and professional settings. He departed from the socialist education system, which is to train advanced technical cadres in a planned and targeted manner, and attempted to revert to the capitalist education system, namely general education. Guangming Daily also published a series of reports and articles with the same tone as Qian Weichang, but did not mention a word about the articles by Du Qinghua and Li Youshan of our school affirming the teaching reform, attempting to create an atmosphere favorable to Qian Weichang. Qian Weichang also took advantage of various opportunities to spread remarks violating socialism in various places. Until the rectification movement, his attacks on the Party became even more rampant.
    Associate Professor He Chengjun also made a preliminary account of his relationship with Qian Weichang at the meeting. He said that during the rectification and airing of views, due to long-term opposition to the organization and standing on a reactionary position, I made a big mistake. On June 2, the comrades of the student union invited me to give a speech at the free forum. I was afraid that the mood would be wrong, I would say the wrong thing, and there would be chaos, so I declined. Later, Qian Weichang said to me, "It's good to speak, you can expand your influence!" Now I want to ask Qian Weichang: "What influence do you want to expand? Do you want students to take to the streets, create chaos, and then you come to clean up the mess?" Qian Weichang also told me that the central government is unwilling to let go of the Tsinghua line.
    Professor Zhang Guangdou believes that the anti-socialist scientific program formulated by Qian Weichang is an attempt to replace the Party's leadership over scientific work with rightists.
    Professor Zhang Guangdou said: The "Several Opinions on Issues Concerning China's Scientific System" proposed by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League's "Scientific Planning Issues" group is an anti-Party and anti-socialist program. This reactionary program was drafted by Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang, among others. In this program, there is no mention of the Communist Party of China; nor is there any mention of the Party Central Committee's call to march into science, the correctness of the Party's scientific policies, and the great achievements of China's scientific undertaking under the leadership of the Party since liberation; nor is there any mention of socialist construction and the need for scientific research to fulfill the country's scientific and technological tasks. On the contrary, we see wanton attacks and distortions of the scientific policies and guidelines formulated by the Party, and we also see the utmost efforts to incite discord between the Party and scientists, and between the Party and young intellectuals. Qian Weichang and others intend to get rid of the Party's leadership over scientific work and replace it with his bourgeois rightists. Qian Weichang viciously attacked the scientific system formulated by the Party, aiming to undermine the socialist scientific cause. Qian Weichang used double-dealing tactics, attacking the Academy of Sciences in universities for "monopolizing without doing anything," wanting to use universities as research centers; and attacking universities in the Academy of Sciences for suppressing scientific research. He set fires on both sides, sowing discord, and fearing that the world would not be in chaos.
    Professor Zhang Wei revealed Qian Weichang's long-term conspiracy to formulate an anti-socialist scientific program.
    Professor Zhang Wei said: I want to reveal Qian Weichang's conspiracy to implement his anti-Party and anti-socialist scientific program. This program is the scientific part of Zhang Bojun's political design institute. They planned to use this program to first open a gap in the cultural, educational, and scientific departments. This is an organized, planned, programmed, and routed activity of their group over a long period of time. We can affirm the reactionary nature of their activities on the basis of three aspects: First, for a long time, Qian Weichang has used various occasions and opportunities to extensively understand the situation and carry out incitement and agitation. His opposition to the Party's leadership of scientific research has been long-standing. For a long time, he has spent a lot of effort in figuring out the situation of scientists in various places and understanding what dissatisfactions those people have with the Party. He used Fei Xiaotong's method of contacting people to mobilize everywhere. Second, he organized and planned to formulate and implement this poisonous scientific program. He began to carry out activities from March and April. Later, the "Temporary Research Group on Scientific Planning Issues" established in the name of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League was mainly planned by Zeng Zhaolun and Qian Weichang. Zhang Bojun believed that this program was a major event. When Guangming Daily, under his control, published this program on June 9, he wrote a short commentary saying that this program "has opened up new ways for mutual supervision, represents the legitimate interests of its members, and the work of the China Democratic League is only the beginning of this new way of working." What does this mean? This means that the Communist Party can no longer represent the legitimate interests of scientists, and it is clearly announced that there will be other programs in the future, this is only the first beginning, the rightists are extremely arrogant. It can be seen that these rightists attach great importance to this document. The Science Planning Commission was originally scheduled to hold a meeting on June 13 to solve a series of problems. Qian Weichang and Zeng Zhaolun, taking advantage of their positions as members of the Science Planning Commission, fully understood the problems that the Science Planning Commission was going to solve, and held continuous meetings before June 9 to discuss and hurriedly put these problems in their reactionary program as a disguise. In fact, the core of the program is their anti-Party and anti-socialist conspiracy. They used double-dealing tactics to try to win the support of the masses for their anti-Party scientific program. What is even more vicious is that before submitting this plan in the name of the China Democratic League to the Science Planning Commission, they hurriedly published it in the Guangming Daily to put pressure on the Science Planning Commission, that is, on the Party and the government, and launched a rampant attack. Third, after seeing the conspiracy exposed, Qian Weichang used double-dealing tactics to cover up and retreat. On the first day of the Science Planning Commission meeting, they were still aggressive and wanted the Science Planning Commission to submit this reactionary scientific program to the conference for discussion. On the second day (June 14), after the speech of Shi Liang, vice chairman of the China Democratic League, exposing Zhang Bojun's anti-Party conspiracy was published in the newspaper, Qian Weichang and Zeng Zhaolun shrank back. On the third day, he changed his face again and said that he supported the leadership of the Party. Could it be that Qian Weichang forgot all the items in his scientific program that opposed the leadership of the Party and did not want the Academy of Sciences to be the locomotive after sleeping for one night? No, he was covering up and retreating. Zhang Wei also questioned Qian Weichang, saying that in a so-called review in the Ministry of Higher Education on the evening of July 11, Zeng Zhaolun also said that the natural science part of this reactionary scientific program was actually mostly Qian Weichang's idea and presided over it. Therefore, we want to ask Qian Weichang and Zeng Zhaolun, what is the situation?
    Professor Zhang Mingtao said that Qian Weichang said that the current five-year students are not as good as the four-year students before liberation. This means that the past British and American education system is much better than the current Soviet education system. Is it possible that the British and American education system is suitable for socialist countries? After the exposure of many old teachers, this argument has no place to stand. What is the purpose of Qian Weichang putting forward this argument? Many teachers have improved their teaching level through learning from the Soviet Union. The lectures are no longer scholastic, but closely integrated with production practice. The topics of our current course design and graduation design are all from actual topics of the enterprise sector, and the reference materials used by students are the reference materials used by engineers. Students' ability to work independently has improved compared to the past. It was impossible to ask students to make a usable design in the past.
    The road that Qian Weichang flaunts is the capitalist road. Everyone is very clear that China must take the socialist road, which is the firm and unwavering road of the 600 million people of the country.
    Qian Weichang said that he wants to take the socialist road, so why does he painstakingly cancel the leadership of the Party and open a gap for the bourgeois rightists in the cultural and educational departments? Everyone knows that without the leadership of the Communist Party, it would not be possible to drive away the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and it would not be possible to lay the foundation for China's socialist construction in just eight years. The Communist Party is not only the lifeline of workers and peasants, but also the lifeline of all patriotic intellectuals. We intellectuals must defend the Party, defend socialism, and never allow the rightists to overthrow the Communist Party.
    Chang Jiong reviewed his own sentimentalism, saying that he clearly saw that Qian Weichang was the vanguard of the Zhang-Luo Group's attack on the Party in higher education.
    Professor Chang Jiong reviewed and accounted for his relationship with Qian Weichang and the many influences he had received from Qian. Although his review and accounting were not deep enough, they were still welcomed by everyone.
    Chang Jiong said that since Qian Weichang led the work of the Radio Engineering Department, he had painstakingly wanted to open a gap from the Radio Engineering Department as a bridgehead for his attack on the whole school and the Party. Because my position was unstable, I was incited by him. In the anti-rightist struggle, I made the mistake of sentimentalism, and I shielded him. Now I have clearly seen that Qian Weichang is the vanguard of the Zhang-Luo Group's attack on the Party in higher education. Qian Weichang knew that I had many views in the teaching reform discussion that were the same as his, so he wooed me, and from then on, he deliberately incited my relationship with the Party and my views on the leadership. He told me that his teaching views were only disagreed with by Harbin Institute of Technology and Tsinghua University in the whole country. He said, isn't this clear! The leaders of these two schools are dogmatists and cannot be persuaded. These words were clearly nonsense. Qian Weichang also deliberately wanted to promote the Radio Engineering Department as his political capital. At this time, Qian Weichang began to openly attack the leadership, saying that the school was afraid of reviewing dogmatism and that people were organized to attack him. At that time, because I was ideologically captured by Qian, I also thought that it was dogmatic to say that teaching problems were class struggles and two lines. Thinking about it now, Qian Weichang, Meng Zhaoying, and I all denied that the teaching discussion was a class struggle problem. Regarding the issue of revising the teaching plan of the Radio Engineering Department, Qian supported Meng Zhaoying's opinion. Although I had some different views, I did not argue at the time. Before reporting to the school leaders, we reached a consensus, that is, formed a united front.
    Qian Weichang and Meng Zhaoying had the same opinions on teaching issues, and the same on political issues. Therefore, during the rectification period, Qian Weichang and Meng Zhaoying took advantage of the rectification opportunity to boldly attack the Party. In the department, Meng Zhaoying behaved arbitrarily and looked down on everyone. He always wanted to suppress the Party leadership in the department. Qian Weichang, on the other hand, outside the department, made a big fuss about the issue of sectarianism within the department as an excuse to attack the Party. They cooperated very well from the inside and outside. At this time, Qian Weichang not only went to the student free forum to talk about teaching issues himself, but also encouraged Meng Zhaoying and me to speak to the students. This was nothing more than trying to win over the masses and oppose the Party's teaching policy.
    After the symposium of teachers of the Radio Engineering Department was published in "New Tsinghua", some teachers and Party members in the department had opinions. Qian Weichang took the opportunity to incite. He said: "Quickly put up a big-character poster, writing that New Tsinghua distorts the facts and takes things out of context, we are not responsible." His purpose was to arouse the dissatisfaction of the masses with "New Tsinghua". We did not listen to him at the time. Later, when writing the big-character poster, Qian Weichang changed his mind again, teaching us to write more good words, such as "We are loyal and love the Party", he said that this way we would not be labeled.
    At twelve o'clock on the night of June 1, I heard Qian Weichang's child making noise at the door. My wife thought something had happened to Qian's family, so she hurried out to see, only to see Qian taking the child to put up big-character posters. When Qian Weichang saw that our door was still open, he ran in and cursed like a madman: "Tonight, big-character posters have been posted all over the wall (referring to the first big-character poster questioning the relationship between Qian Weichang and Zhang Bojun). The problem is very clear, it is to attack me, anyway, they can't catch my pigtail. I want to tell Premier Zhou about this matter. Either I get out, or Jiang Nanxiang gets out. I resign to Premier Zhou. If I am allowed to resign, that's fine. If I am not allowed to resign, I have to make it clear." He also said: "Let's go, we must leave Tsinghua and go to the Academy of Sciences. Research work is better than teaching. You go too! Meng Zhaoying has already gone to the Academy of Sciences, let Ma Shixiong also go. We still have many people who want to go, let's see how Jiang Nanxiang explains."
    Student Zhao Baochu revealed that Qian Weichang instigated students to "make trouble" and single-handedly created the large-scale signature campaign for the merger of science and engineering universities.
    Zhao Baochu, a fourth-year student in the Department of Engineering Physics, said: Now I want to reveal the situation of the 6,000-person signature campaign for the merger of science and engineering universities, which was created single-handedly by Qian Weichang. This is part of his political conspiracy. On the evening of June 1, more than 20 students in our class visited him. He colorfully boasted to us about how high the quality of students was before liberation, saying that writing decent papers in the third and fourth grades was nothing at all, and he boasted about the old style of study. Then someone mentioned that there was a signature campaign for the merger of science and engineering universities in front of the Science Museum. Qian asked, "How many people have signed?" We said more than 600 people. Qian said, "600 people is too few, 6,000 people is more like it, let the Ministry of Higher Education see the opinions of the masses." And he repeatedly emphasized the need to struggle, and victory will always be achieved through struggle. Someone asked, why doesn't Mr. Qian come out to speak? He said, it is not convenient for me to come forward, you do it well, the Ministry of Higher Education has already admitted that this is a dogmatic mistake. Qian Weichang also put forward several plans at that time: the Department of Science of Peking University should be merged into Tsinghua, or the Department of Science of Peking University should be merged into Tsinghua, and the others should be merged with Renmin University to be called Peking University, and the Peking University signboard should be hung at Renmin University, and the dogmatic name of Renmin University should simply be discarded. Qian Weichang also said that even if it cannot be merged with Peking University, at least it should sing a rival show, as long as Tsinghua starts a science department, many famous professors will come, and some Chinese professors in the United States will definitely come as long as Tsinghua does it.
    After Qian Weichang's instigation, a large-scale working group for the merger of science and engineering universities was established in Class Eight of the Department of Engineering Physics on the morning of the next day. Five people were appointed as the head and deputy heads, and working groups for students, professors, propaganda, and logistics were set up. If manpower was insufficient, the union with Physics Nine was formed. It was not enough to rely on the students alone, teachers had to help. It was decided to do it on a large scale throughout the school, go to each class to organize signatures, and prepare in many ways. For example, visiting department directors and famous professors, organizing forums and professor reports, writing a large number of big-character posters, printing signature papers... and so on. As soon as it comes out, it must be a grand event that shocks the whole school. The working group was personally directed by Qian Weichang. Qian was very proud, and the specific plans of the working group were implemented only after he agreed. At that time, the most critical and important issue was to invite the nationally famous scientists Qian Xuesen and Hua Luogeng to speak, because Qian Weichang was very clear that the students would listen to Qian Xuesen and Hua Luogeng. As long as they said that the merger of science and engineering universities was good, everyone would sign up enthusiastically. This task was personally responsible by Qian Weichang. Hua Luogeng had just had an operation in the hospital at the time and was not suitable for giving reports. Qian Weichang said that this was a minor illness, he could speak, and he still had to invite him. Later, he probably didn't invite him. For Qian Xuesen, Qian Weichang knew that he was unwilling to talk about the issue of the merger of science and engineering universities, so he decided at the time to superficially invite Qian Xuesen to give a report on technical science, but in fact, he asked people to pass notes at the meeting, forcing him to answer this question. Qian Weichang planned and instigated it in this way!
    Professor Zhong Shimo believes that Qian Weichang not only knew in advance about Chu Anping's so-called "Party World" fallacy, but also jointly planned it.
    Professor Zhong Shimo said, I am now going to reveal that rightist Qian Weichang is an important accomplice of Chu Anping's fallacy of "Party World". Qian Weichang once said at the student free forum that he never dreamed that he had anything to do with Chu Anping's statement of "Party World". However, the day after Chu Anping published the anti-Party and anti-socialist fallacy of "Party World", Qian Weichang said to me in a very affirmative tone during the break of the expanded preparatory committee of the Institute of Automation of the Academy of Sciences that he fully agreed with the opinions expressed by Chu Anping. He also said, how can it work if every unit has a Party member as the head! He did not show the slightest opposition to Chu Anping's remarks, on the contrary, his words, tone, and demeanor fully indicated that he was an active supporter of Chu Anping's fallacy. He not only agreed with Chu Anping's so-called fallacy of "Party World", but also knew about it in advance and jointly planned it. Qian Weichang revealed such a flaw in his third confession. He said that Chu Anping came to Tsinghua on May 26 to talk to him about raising the issue of eliminating counter-revolutionaries at the National People's Congress, talking about feeling out the bottom of the airing of views, and making suggestions to Chairman Mao, and so on. That day, Qian Weichang said that the main content of the airing of views in the school was sectarianism, and Chu Anping said, "It's like this everywhere, it's really a family world". Chu Anping said in his confession that he had discussed the "Party World" fallacy with Luo Longji and Qian Weichang before publishing it. Isn't the reason why the rightists want to say "Party World" is to oppose the leadership of the Party? Isn't it to make all kinds of work depart from the leadership of the Communist Party and deviate from the socialist track? We know that leaving the leadership of the Party will bring great disasters to the people. We will never forget the lessons of history! If we follow the proposals of the rightists, it will be to destroy our country and make our heads fall to the ground!
    Lecturer Xia Zhenying said, what is the relationship between Qian Weichang and Zeng Zhaolun? You said yourself that you only had contact recently, that only scientific planning is a political issue, and that other contacts are not political. Can this be believed? Zeng Zhaolun wanted you to feel out the bottom of the cultural and educational circles, is this not a political issue? How did you feel it out? In early March, when college graduates in Taiyuan had opinions on graduation design, you flew to Taiyuan on March 12 and spoke to thousands of students on March 13. May I ask who sent you there? What did you talk about? You also gave a report at the founding meeting of the Taiyuan Association for Science and Technology, who asked you to go again? You took advantage of the opportunity to accompany experts on visits and inspections, frequently contacting members of the China Democratic League in Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, and gave a speech at a conference of thousands of people in Guangzhou. Is this not a political issue? Secondly, regarding your relationship with Zhang Bojun, you said that you did not have much contact. Why did you become close friends after one meeting on June 6? Zeng Zhaolun said in his review at the Ministry of Higher Education that your speech at the meeting on the 6th was the most intense, so that Zeng Zhaolun was also infected and excited for a long time. Zeng Zhaolun said that after you analyzed the situation, you proposed three solutions. The first was that the Communist Party mobilize three million troops to take to the streets, which would lose people's hearts, and the Communist Party would not do it. Second, the Communist Party proposed to take it back, which would also lose people's hearts, so intellectuals would not speak in the future. Third, the China Democratic League came out to speak, and obviously the third method was feasible. Why don't you confess these words? Furthermore, you said that your relationship with Luo Longji was only to listen to his reports a few times, which is obviously not the case. Zeng Zhaolun talked about your enthusiasm for the work of intellectuals, and Luo Longji was more concerned about the affairs of intellectuals, so Luo had more contact with you, why don't you confess it? You also said that you only met Chu Anping once, but you were talking about political issues, he discussed the "Party World" matter with you, only once, how could you talk so deeply?
    Li Yonglu, a technician at the Thermal Engineering Laboratory, said, our staff did not expect that there are now such a group of anti-socialist rightists. They took advantage of the rectification movement to spread various fallacies. Qian Weichang advocated professor governance of the school, which our staff do not agree with. I want to ask Qian Weichang, can you run a school without staff? We will never allow going back to the old university where professors governed the school, because only in today's new university led by the Communist Party can our staff be valued.
    Now, the political status and political rights of the staff are equal. Is there such democracy in the world except in countries led by the Communist Party? Unexpectedly, some people are still calling for so-called returning power to the people, is it to return the people's power to Qian Weichang?
    The disadvantages of the old society cannot be exhausted, and the advantages of the new society cannot be exhausted. The rightists Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji want to ride on the heads of our working people for the benefit of their small group of people. Our staff tell the rightists that your attempt to seize the people's power will never be realized. In this life-and-death struggle, we staff resolutely unite around the Party and resolutely defeat the attacks of the rightists.
    This meeting lasted from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Teachers such as Wang Tan, Ma Liang, and Jin Lan also spoke at the meeting. Because there are still many people who want to speak, the meeting will continue on the evening of the 14th.

    在“反教条”旗帜的掩护下贩卖资本主义私货
    钱伟长是章罗联盟在科学界的掮客
    本报讯　清华大学在13日召开了批判右派分子、清华大学副校长钱伟长的大会。参加大会的除清华大学全校师生员工外，还有中国科学院、高等教育部以及北京各学校的许多代表。在大礼堂里和许多教室中，以及礼堂门前的大草坪上都坐满了人。与此同时，在北京大学的校园里，全校师生员工也收听了这个大会的实况广播。
    今天的会议是由清华大学副校长陈士骅和清华大学党委副书记刘冰主持。陈士骅首先作了简短发言，接着即由右派分子钱伟长做第五次检查交代。在他发言过程中，会场上不断递上条子来要他老老实实的作彻底的交代。
    接着，许多教授、学生以及职工在大会上揭露和批判了钱伟长的反对党的领导、反对社会主义的言论和行动。他们着重谈到了钱伟长挑拨党和高级知识分子的关系，反对党的领导，反对社会主义的教育方针和制度，否定教学改革的成绩，提倡资本主义的教育制度，策划反社会主义的科学纲领，煽动要求理工合校大签名等反动活动。
    张子高教授列举事实说明党对高级知识分子的关怀和尊重，驳斥钱伟长挑拨党与高级知识分子关系的谬论
    张子高教授说：5月17日人民日报登了“钱伟长语重心长谈矛盾”那篇向新华社记者的谈话。钱伟长在那里制造了许多矛盾。首先是党和非党人士之间的矛盾，他认为不仅清华如此，目前全国高等学校对老教授的作用和积极性的估计不足是个普遍严重问题。他并且引用梁思成先生的情况为例。后来梁先生对整风的体会文章发表了，大家看到梁先生还是很积极的，是拥护党的。现在我要问你当时是何居心？是不是想拉拢一些人为你作证呢？党屡次鼓励我把中国化学史研究工作抓起来，当我生病时，党团员在周围照顾我，使我感激流泪。后来蒋校长、刘副校长也都到我家来慰问，这难道是人情味薄吗？就我所知，北京师范大学的陈垣先生，北京大学的汤用彤先生，这几位老先生都是学术上得到很高的尊重，有病时又得到非常周到的照顾。最近有两位老同学来看我，都是七十左右年岁的人。他们在安徽矿业学院工作，都是兴致勃勃地在干。这难道不是积极性的表现吗？再拿你钱伟长本人来说，职位荣誉那一件不比解放前来得高许多，这难道还说党估计作用不足吗？
    钱伟长做了副校长，就同校长搞对立，钱伟长把老清华搬出来，和新清华对立，一概以为今不如昔。新清华是与老清华有所不同，新清华承继了一部分优良传统，批判了一部分不良的习惯，同时培养出一部分新生力量。青出于蓝，一辈胜过一辈，正是发展的现象。我爱老清华，我尤其爱新清华。钱伟长则以为这样也不好，那样也不对，究竟你是何居心？
    钱伟长还说过，另外一条路线比它（指党的工作）走得快，这就是他的反党路线，也就是资本主义的路线，要和党的路线，也就是社会主义路线赛跑。当然，他不能明目张胆地这样提，他总是用偷天换日的，换汤不换药的，表面上一套，骨子里一套，来达到他的目的。
    在科学体制问题上，钱伟长身为科学规划委员会委员，利用党对他的信任，把委员会对科学规划建议的内容拿了出来，在章伯钧指使之下，和其他右派分子曾昭抡、费孝通大加篡改，加入一些资产阶级的毒素，作为民盟工作小组的建议。他们不要党在科学研究中的领导，他们不要科学研究计划性，他们不要科学研究结合我国当前生产建设的需要，他们不要对新生的科学研究力量进行政治思想教育工作。这是反党反社会主义的科学纲领。
    1月7日光明日报发表钱伟长关于教学计划、培养目标问题的谈话，实质上在总的方面是否定了学习苏联的方针和教学改革的成绩，在教学环节方面否定了生产实习、毕业设计，忽视了专业课和专业设置的意义。他离开社会主义教育制度，即有计划有目标的培养高级技术干部，而企图转回到资本主义教育制度，即通才教育。光明日报还发表一系列与钱伟长论调相同的报道和文章，对我校杜庆华、李酉山肯定教学改革的文章，则一字不提，企图造成对钱伟长有利的气氛。钱伟长还借种种机会在各地散布违反社会主义的言论，一直到整风运动中，向党的进攻更加猖獗。
    何成钧副教授在会上也把他和钱伟长的关系做了初步交代。他说，我在整风鸣放期间，由于长期与组织对立，站在反动立场上，犯了大错误。6月2日，学生会的同志邀我到自由论坛上去讲演，我怕情绪不对头，话说错，出乱子，就推辞不去。后来钱伟长对我说：“去讲也好，可以扩大影响！”我现在要问钱伟长：“你要扩大什么影响？你是否想要学生上街，制造混乱局面，然后你来收拾残局？”钱伟长还同我讲，中央对清华这条线就是不肯放。
    张光斗教授认为钱伟长参加制定的反社会主义的科学纲领，是企图使党对科学工作的领导由右派分子取而代之
    张光斗教授说：民盟中央“科学规划问题”组提出的“对于有关我国科学体制问题的几点意见”是反党反社会主义的纲领。这个反动纲领是由曾昭抡和钱伟长等所起草的，在这个纲领中，没有提到中国共产党；也没有提到党中央向科学进军的号召，党的科学政策的正确，以及解放后我国科学事业在党领导下取得的巨大成就；也没有提到社会主义建设以及科学研究要完成国家的科学技术任务。相反地，我们却看到对党所制定的科学政策和方针的肆意攻击和歪曲，并且竭力挑拨党和科学家、党和青年知识分子的关系。钱伟长等的意图是要摆脱党对科学工作的领导，由他的这些资产阶级右派分子“取而代之”。钱伟长恶毒地攻击党所制定的科学体制，目的在破坏社会主义科学事业。钱伟长使用了两面派手法，在高等学校中攻击科学院“一家独占，占而不为”，要以高等学校作为研究中心；在科学院那里他又攻击高等学校压制科学研究。两面放火，挑拨离间，唯恐天下不乱。
    张维教授揭露钱伟长为制定反社会主义科学纲领所作的长期阴谋活动
    张维教授说：我要揭露钱伟长贯彻他的反党反社会主义科学纲领的阴谋活动。这个纲领是章伯钧的政治设计院中科学的部分。他们策划着用这个纲领首先在文教和科学部门中打开缺口。这是他们这个集团在长时间内有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线的活动。我们这样肯定他们的活动的这种反动性质，是有根据的。这可从三方面来看：第一，长时期以来钱伟长利用各种场合和机会广泛了解情况，进行挑拨煽动。他反对党对于科学研究的领导由来已久，长时间来他花了许多力量在摸各地科学家的底，了解那些人对党有些什么不满情绪。他用了费孝通的串联方法各处发动。第二，他有组织、有计划地拟定和贯彻这个毒恶的科学纲领。他从3、4月间就开始进行活动。以后假借民盟中央名义成立的“科学规划问题临时研究组”，就是由曾昭抡和钱伟长主谋的。章伯钧认为这个纲领是一件大事，在他把持下的光明日报在6月9日发表这个纲领的同时，就写了短评，说这个纲领“为互相监督开拓了新的道路，是代表其成员的正当利益，民盟这件工作还只是这一新工作方式方法的开端”。这是什么意思呢？这是说，共产党已然不能代表科学家的正当利益了，明明宣布以后还要其他方面的纲领，这只是第一次的开端，右派分子狂妄到了极点。可见这些右派分子对于这一文件的重视。科学规划委员会原定在6月13日开会解决一系列的问题的。钱伟长和曾昭抡利用是科学规划委员会的委员的职务，将科学规划委员会要解决的问题完全摸了底，就在6月9日前连续开会商量，赶忙将这些问题也放在他们的反动纲领内，做为外衣。其实，纲领核心是他们的反党、反社会主义的阴谋主张。他们利用两面派手法想争取群众对他们反党的科学纲领的支持。更毒辣的是他们在向科学规划委员会提出这一假借民盟名义的方案之前，就赶忙在光明日报发表，向科学规划委员会，也就是向党和政府施加压力，猖狂进攻。第三，钱伟长在看到阴谋暴露后，又用两面派手法，打掩护，撤退。科学规划委员会开会的第一天，他们还是气势汹汹，要科学规划委员会将这一反动科学纲领提至大会讨论，到了第二天（6月14日）民盟副主席史良揭发了章伯钧的反党阴谋的发言登在报上后，钱伟长和曾昭抡就缩回去了。第三天他又换了一副嘴脸说拥护党的领导。难道钱伟长睡了一宿觉，把他那科学纲领中反对党的领导，不要科学院做火车头等项主张全都忘记了吗？不是的，他是要掩护撤退。张维并质问钱伟长说，7月11日晚曾昭抡在高教部中的一次所谓检讨中，还说到这个反动的科学纲领的自然科学部分实际上多是钱伟长在出主意主持，因此我们要问钱伟长和曾昭抡，到底情况如何？
    章名涛教授说，钱伟长说现在五年制的学生不如解放前四年制的学生。这就是说过去的英美式的教育制度比现在学习苏联的教育制度要好的多。难道说英美的教育制度是适应社会主义国家的么？经过许多老教师的揭露，这种论点已经没有立锥之地。钱伟长提出这种论点的用意何在呢？许多教师通过学习苏联，教学水平提高了。讲课再不是经院式的，而是与生产实际密切结合。我们现在做的课程设计和毕业设计的题目，都是来自企业部门的实际的题目，学生用的参考资料是工程师们用的参考资料。学生独立工作的能力比从前提高了，从前叫学生做一个能用的设计是不可能的。
    钱伟长标榜的道路是资本主义的道路。大家都很清楚，中国必须走社会主义的道路，这是全国六亿人民坚定不移的道路。
    钱伟长说他要走社会主义道路，那么为什么要处心积虑地取消党的领导，在文教部门为资产阶级右派打开缺口呢？大家都知道没有共产党的领导，是不能赶跑蒋介石匪帮，不可能在短短的八年中奠定了中国社会主义建设的基石的，共产党不仅是工农的命根子，也是一切爱国知识分子的命根子。我们知识分子要保卫党、保卫社会主义，决不允许右派分子推翻共产党。
    常迥检讨自己的温情主义，他说看清楚了钱伟长是章罗集团在高教方面向党进攻的急先锋
    常迥教授在会上检查交代了他和钱伟长的关系和他受到钱的许多影响，他的检查交代虽然还不够深刻，但还是受到了大家的欢迎。
    常迥说，自从钱伟长领导无线电系的工作以来，他就处心积虑地想从无线电系打开一个缺口，作为他向全校进攻向党进攻的桥头堡。由于我的立场不稳，我受到了他的煽动。在反右派斗争中，我犯了温情主义的错误，我包庇了他。现在我已经看清楚钱伟长是章、罗集团在高教方面进攻的急先锋。钱伟长知道我在教学改革讨论当中有许多观点和他的看法有相同之点，他就拉拢我，也就从那时起，别有用心地挑拨我和党的关系和对领导的看法。他跟我说，他的教学观点，全国只有哈尔滨工业大学和清华大学不同意。他说，这还不清楚吗！这两个学校的领导都是教条主义者，没法说通。他这些话明明是胡说。钱伟长还别有用心的要把无线电系吹起来，做为他的政治资本。就在这时，钱伟长开始明目张胆地攻击领导，他说学校怕检讨教条主义，说组织人来打击他。我当时因为思想上被钱俘虏，我也认为把教学问题说成阶级斗争、两条路线，这真是教条。现在想起来，当时钱伟长、孟昭英和我三人都否认教学讨论是阶级斗争的问题。对于无线电系修订教学计划的问题，钱支持孟昭英的意见，我虽有些不同看法，当时也就没有争辩。我们在向学校领导汇报以前，几个人先取得了一致的意见，也就是形成一个联合阵线。
    钱伟长和孟昭英在教学问题上意见一致，在政治问题上也是一样的。因此，到了整风期间，钱伟长和孟昭英借整风机会，大胆地向党进攻。在系里，孟昭英表现得独断独行，目空一切。他总想把系里的党领导压下去。而钱伟长则在系外，借系内宗派主义的问题，大肆渲染，做为向党进攻的口实，里应外合，配得很好。就在这时，钱伟长不但自己到学生自由论坛上大讲教学问题，还鼓动孟昭英和我去给学生讲话。这无非想争取群众，和党的教学方针相对立。
    当无线电系教师座谈会在“新清华”上发表以后，系里有几位教师和党员之间有了意见。钱伟长就乘机大肆挑拨。他说：“赶快出张大字报，写新清华歪曲事实、断章取义，我们概不负责”。他的目的是为了引起群众对“新清华”的不满，我们当时没有听他的话。后来写大字报的时候，钱伟长又多变了个主意，教我们多写些好话，如“我们是忠实热爱党的”，他说这样就戴不上帽子了。
    6月1日晚上十二点，我听到钱伟长家小孩在门口吵吵闹闹，我爱人以为钱家出了什么事，赶快出去看，只见钱带着小孩去贴大字报。钱伟长见我们门还开着，就跑了进来，像疯了似的，大骂一阵：“今天一晚大字报贴了满墙（指第一次质问钱伟长和章伯钧的关系的大字报），问题很清楚，就是要打我，反正抓不着我的小辫子。这件事我要去告诉周总理，不是我滚蛋，就是蒋南翔滚蛋。我向周总理辞职，允许我辞职，就算啦，不允许我辞职，就得说个明白”。他还说：“走，一定要离清华，到科学院去。做研究工作比教学好，你也走！孟昭英反正已经去科学院，让马世雄也走。我们还有许多人要走，看蒋南翔怎么交代。”
    学生赵葆初揭露钱伟长煽动学生“闹事”，一手制造理工合校大签名
    工程物理系四年级学生赵葆初说：现在我想揭露一下钱伟长一手制造的理工合校六千人大签名的情况，这是他政治阴谋活动中的一部分。在6月1日晚上，我们班二十多位同学去访他，他有声有色地向我们吹嘘了解放前的学生质量多么高，说什么三、四年级写出像样的论文根本算不了什么，又吹嘘老学风。接着有人提到说科学馆前面在搞理工合校签名，钱问“有多少人签名了？”我们说六百多人了。钱说“六百多人太少了，六千多人还差不多，让高教部看看群众的意见”。而且他再三强调要斗争，经过斗争总会胜利的。有人问，钱先生为什么不出来讲话呢？他说，我出面不方便，你们去搞好，高教部已经承认这是一个教条主义的错误。钱伟长当时还提出了几个方案：北大理学院并到清华来，或者北大理学院并到清华，其它和人大合并叫北京大学，把北京大学的牌子挂到人大去，把人民大学这个教条主义的名字就干脆不要了。钱伟长还说，就是不能和北大并，至少要唱对台戏才好，只要清华搞起理学院来，很多名教授都会来的，有的在美国的中国教授只要清华搞就一定会来的。
    在钱伟长煽动以后，第二天上午工程物理系八班一个规模浩大的理工合校工作组成立了，设正副组长五人，下设同学、教授、宣传、后勤等工作小组，人力不足，联合了物九，光靠同学还不行，要教师帮助，决定在全校大搞，到每个班上去组织签名，而且多方面进行准备工作。例如访问系主任、名教授，组织论坛及教授报告会，写出大量大字报，印签名纸……等等。一出来，就要声势浩大，全校震动。工作组由钱伟长亲自指挥，钱非常得意，工作组具体计划都是他同意后才执行的。当时最关键最重要的问题，是要请全国著名科学家钱学森和华罗庚来讲话，因为钱伟长是非常清楚地知道，钱学森和华罗庚的话是同学们听得进的。只要他们说理工合校好，大家签名就会很踊跃。这个任务由钱伟长亲自负责，华罗庚当时刚从医院里开完刀，身体不适于作报告。钱伟长说，这是小病，可以讲，还是要去请。后来大概没请到。对钱学森，钱伟长知道他不愿讲理工合校这个问题，当时就决定表面上去请钱学森来做技术科学的报告，实际上在会上叫人递条子逼着他回答这个问题。钱伟长就是这样阴谋策划煽动的！
    钟士模教授认为储安平的所谓“党天下”谬论，钱伟长不但事先知道而且曾共同策划
    钟士模教授说，我现在要揭发右派分子钱伟长是储安平“党天下”谬论的重要同谋者。钱伟长在学生自由论坛上曾经说他连做梦也没有想到与储安平发表“党天下”言论有什么关系。可是就在储安平发表“党天下”的反党反社会主义的谬论的第二天，钱伟长就在科学院自动化研究所开扩大筹委会的休息时间用很肯定的口气对我说，他对储安平所发表的意见是完全赞成的，他还说每一个单位都按上一个党员做头那怎么能行呀！丝毫也听不出他有半点反对储安平的议论，相反地他的言语声调神态完全表明他是储安平谬论的积极支持者。他不仅赞成储安平的所谓“党天下”的谬论，而且事先也知道，并且共同策划。钱伟长在第三次的交代中曾经露了这样的马脚，他说储安平5月26日来清华找他谈到要在人大提肃反问题，谈到要摸鸣放的底，要向毛主席提意见等等。那天钱伟长表示过学校中鸣放的主要内容是宗派主义，储安平就说“到处都如此，真是家天下”。储安平在交代时说他在发表“党天下”谬论之前是与罗隆基、钱伟长商量过的。右派分子之所以要说“党天下”，不就是在反对党的领导吗？不是要使各种工作脱离共产党的领导，脱离社会主义的轨道吗？我们知道脱离党的领导会给人民带来很大灾害。我们是决不会忘记历史上的教训的！假使按照右派分子的主张，就是要我们亡国，要我们人头落地！
    夏镇英讲师说，钱伟长与曾昭抡的关系，到底如何？你自己说只是最近有联系，只是科学规划是政治问题，其他接触都不是政治性的。这能使人相信吗？曾昭抡曾要你摸文教界的底，这不是政治问题吗？你是怎么摸的？你在3月初当太原高等学校毕业生对毕业设计有意见时，3月12日你坐飞机到太原，13日对数千学生讲话，试问谁让你去的？谈了些什么？你又在太原科联分会成立大会上做报告，这又是谁要你去的？你借着陪专家访问、考察机会，在南京、上海、广州等地与盟员接触频繁，在广州几千人大会上讲话。这是不是政治性问题？其次你与章伯钧的关系，你讲接触不多，为何6月6日一次会就一见如故？曾昭抡在高教部检讨时说你在6日会上的发言最激烈，以致曾昭抡也受了感染，激动了好久。曾昭抡说当你们分析形势后，你提出三种解决办法，第一是共产党动员三百万军队上街，这会失去人心，共产党不会干。第二，共产党提出收，这也会失去人心，这样知识分子以后就不讲话了。第三，是由民盟出来讲话，显然第三个办法可行。这些话你为何不交代？再有，你说你和罗隆基的关系，只是听过他几次报告，这显然不是事实，曾昭抡谈过你对知识分子工作热心，而罗隆基过问知识分子事情多，因此罗和你接触较多，为什么也不交代？你还说你与储安平只一面之交，但你们谈的都是政治问题，“党天下”事他与你商量过，只一次之交，何以谈的如此之深？
    热工实验室技工李永禄说，我们职工没想到现在有这么一批反社会主义右派分子，他们乘整风运动散布各种谬论。钱伟长主张教授治校，我们职工都不同意。我要问钱伟长你办学校不要职工行吗？我们绝不允许再回到教授治校的旧大学，因为只有在共产党领导的今天的新大学里，我们职工才受到了重视。
    现在，职工们的政治地位、政治权利平等。世界上除去共产党领导的国家，还有这样的民主吗？居然，还有人叫唤所谓还政于民，是不是将人民政权还给钱伟长？
    旧社会的坏处说不完，新社会的好处说不完。右派分子章伯钧、罗隆基为了他们一撮人的利益，还要骑在我们劳动人民的头上。我们职工告诉右派分子，你想夺人民的政权是永远不能实现的。我们职工在这样你死我活的斗争中，坚决地团结在党的周围，坚决打退右派分子的进攻。
    这次大会从上午八点钟一直开到下午六点钟，会上发言的还有汪坦、马良、金兰等教师。因为要求发言的人还很多，大会将在14日晚继续举行。
