Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 29th: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: At the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese side, the Military Armistice Commission held a meeting yesterday. At the meeting, Major General Zheng Guolu, chief commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side, lodged a serious protest with the US side regarding its recent sabotage of the Armistice Agreement and the agreement between the armistice parties, and its unilateral decision to cease submitting reports to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission regarding the replacement of combat materiel, demanding that the US side retract this unilateral decision. Zheng Guolu also demanded that the US side immediately transport all combat materiel illegally brought into South Korea out of Korea and immediately submit related reports to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Military Armistice Commission.

Major General Zheng Guolu suggested that the Military Armistice Commission write a reply to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's letter to the Military Armistice Commission dated July 25, 1957, in the spirit mentioned above.

At the meeting, Zheng Guolu pointed out that the Korean and Chinese side had already lodged strong protests twice at the Military Armistice Commission regarding the US side's unilateral announcement of the abandonment of Article 13 (b) of the Armistice Agreement and the introduction of new weapons into South Korea, and demanded that the US side withdraw this decision. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of the People's Republic of China had issued statements respectively, denouncing the US side's behavior and warning the US side to terminate such behavior. All the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world have also raised stern protests and condemnations against the US side's behavior.

However, the US side not only did not stop its behavior of sabotaging the Armistice Agreement, but also unilaterally notified the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on June 29 that the US side had decided to cease submitting reports to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Military Armistice Commission regarding the replacement of combat materiel after June 21, and from then until today, has not submitted any such reports.

Zheng Guolu pointed out that the US side's behavior is an illegal act of grossly trampling on the provisions of the Armistice Agreement and the agreements between the two sides.

Major General Zheng Guolu finally announced that the Korean and Chinese side firmly maintains that all the clauses of the Armistice Agreement must continue to be implemented, and the Korean and Chinese side now and in the future resolutely opposes and will never allow the US side to sabotage the Armistice Agreement. The Korean and Chinese side once again warned the US side that it cannot escape responsibility at any time for all the consequences it has caused. The Korean and Chinese side, together with peace-loving people all over the world, will closely watch the actions of the US side.

    美方片面决定不向中监会报告替换作战物资
    朝中方面抗议美方破坏停战协定
    据新华社平壤29日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会在朝中方面的建议下昨天举行会议。朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将在会上就美方最近破坏停战协定和停战双方的协议，片面决定停止向中立国监察委员会提出关于替换作战物资报告一事，向美方提出严重抗议，要求美方收回这一片面决定。郑国禄并且要求美方立即把非法运入南朝鲜的一切作战物资运出朝鲜境外，立即向中立国监察委员会和军事停战委员会提出与此有关的报告。
    郑国禄少将建议，军事停战委员会要以上述精神写回信答复中立国监察委员会1957年7月25日给军事停战委员会的信。
    郑国禄在会上指出，朝中方面已经在军事停战委员会上两次就美方片面宣布废弃停战协定第十三款卯项，向南朝鲜运入新武器事提出强烈的抗议，并且要求美方撤回这一决定。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府曾分别发表声明，斥责美方的这种行为，并且警告美方要终止这种行为。全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民也对美方的行为提出严正的抗议和谴责。
    但是，美方不但不停止破坏停战协定的行为，反而在6月29日片面通知中立国监察委员会，美方决定在6月21日以后停止向中立国监察委员会和军事停战委员会提出关于替换作战物资的报告，并且从那时以后到今天为止，没有提出一项这类报告。
    郑国禄指出，美方的这种行为是粗暴地蹂躏停战协定的规定和双方协议的非法行为。
    郑国禄少将最后宣布，朝中方面坚决主张必须继续履行停战协定的一切条款，朝中方面现在和将来都坚决反对并决不允许美方破坏停战协定。朝中方面并且再一次向美方提出警告，美方对它所造成的一切后果，任何时候也不能逃避责任。朝中方面同全世界爱好和平的人民将密切注视美方的行动。
