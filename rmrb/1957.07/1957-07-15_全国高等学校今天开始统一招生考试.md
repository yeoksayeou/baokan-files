Xinhua News Agency, July 14th: Over 250,000 young people will begin taking the national unified entrance examination for higher education institutions across the country starting on the 15th.

This year, among the young people applying for higher education institutions nationwide, over 180,000 are graduating senior high school students and graduates of worker-peasant rapid middle schools. Compared to this year's higher education enrollment plan, this represents a ratio of 1.7:1. This is a welcome phenomenon, the first of its kind since liberation.

This year, the proportion of high school graduates and worker-peasant rapid middle school graduates among the applicants has also increased from 42.6% last year to 71.4%. In addition, as of July 14th, the number of returned overseas Chinese students and students from Hong Kong and Macau participating in this examination has exceeded 2,800. The number of employed cadres, primary school teachers, and educated youth awaiting employment who are applying to higher education institutions has decreased compared to previous years.

Prior to the examination, to facilitate candidate registration, the Higher Education Enrollment Committees in various regions increased the number of examination districts nationwide from the original 91 to 110. In particular, remote areas such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region increased from two to six districts, and Yunnan increased from two to seven. Examination districts were established in areas with concentrated minority populations such as Hailar in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Baoshan in Yunnan, and Yishan in Guangxi. The distribution of examination centers in various regions is also more widespread.

    在考试前，各地高等学校招生工作委员会为了便利考生报考，全国的考区从原设的九十一个增加到一百一十个，特别是边远地区，如内蒙古自治区由两个增加到六个；云南由两个增加到七个。内蒙古自治区的海拉尔，云南的保山，广西的宜山等少数民族聚居地区，都设置了考区。各地的考场分布更广。
