The Heilongjiang Province Democratic National Construction Association Members and Industrialists and Businessmen
To Draw a Clear Line with Rightists, Distinguish Right from Wrong
Liu Peizhi's Speech

    I have listened to the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, etc., at this conference, and studied Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." I have gained profound insights and been greatly encouraged. I have further realized that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our great motherland has achieved unprecedented and tremendous brilliant achievements in politics, economy, culture, education, transportation, health, mining, industrial and agricultural production, and so on in the short few years since the founding of the country. What is even more exciting is that our country's international status has been raised to an unprecedented level, and our country's First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy is about to be victoriously completed and overfulfilled. This great plan has brought about profound historical changes in our country's social life. I fully agree with the various reports made at the conference and will strive to implement them with practical actions. Vice Premier Li pointed out in his report that 1956 was the year with the greatest natural disasters in our country in decades. As everyone knows, at that time, the disasters were severe in various places, and flood control, dike repair, gap plugging, and construction work were extremely tense. Our city of Harbin was one of the severely affected areas. When the water situation was serious, the responsible comrades of the provincial and municipal party and government all lived on the flood control construction site, and all provincial and municipal agencies stopped working, mobilizing residents day and night to go all out to repair dikes and control floods, and transferred some of the People's Liberation Army to assist greatly, and finally overcame the floods. Although Songpu District in Jiangbei, Harbin, was flooded, tens of thousands of residents in the district were evacuated in advance, and no one died.

    Although 1956 was the year with the greatest disasters in our country, grain production still increased by more than 15 billion catties compared with 1955. Therefore, the achievements of cooperation are great, especially our country's unified purchase and sale of grain and unified allocation, so that any disaster area has grain to eat; this year, the disaster areas have quickly resumed production, which fully proves the unparalleled superiority of socialism.

    In his report, the Premier gave serious criticism to the rightists' attack on the Party under the guise of the Party's rectification campaign. It was clearly pointed out that although the vast majority of private industrialists and businessmen have participated in joint state-private ownership, they still have exploitative relations because they still receive fixed interest, and the dual nature of the bourgeoisie still exists. Absurd and erroneous remarks such as some people "advocating or agreeing to extend the fixed interest for twenty years," "wanting to pay the twenty-year fixed interest in one lump sum," "fixed interest is not exploitation, but merely unearned income," "there is no essential difference between the bourgeoisie and the working class, and the bourgeoisie does not need to be reformed," and "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism" were also analyzed and criticized one by one. This has made us more clearly aware of the reactionary features of the rightists, increased our weapons for the struggle against the rightists, further distinguished right from wrong, distinguished between ourselves and the enemy, and better carried out a resolute struggle against the rightists!

    For a month, the people of the whole country have responded to the call of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the spirit of caring for the Party and helping the Party to further improve its work, they have earnestly put forward criticisms and opinions to the Party, which have been valued and welcomed by the Party. Like the industrialists, businessmen, and people from all walks of life, we have seriously expressed our opinions and actively helped the Party in its rectification campaign; however, the rightists have taken advantage of this opportunity, using helping the Party in its rectification campaign as a cover, and frantically launched activities against the Party, against the working class, and to undermine the socialist cause. Zhang Naiqi is a prominent figure among the rightists.

    Zhang Naiqi's distorted fallacies were criticized by comrades at the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic National Construction Association last winter.

    Recently, he took advantage of the Party's rectification campaign and issued a series of absurd remarks, spreading poison and causing extremely bad influences on industrialists and businessmen in various places. Comrades have once again seriously criticized his mistakes and patiently helped him repeatedly in good faith, in order to urge him to reflect and hope that he can rein in at the precipice; however, he insisted on his anti-socialist activities, and the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce only took measures.

    The Central Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have jointly issued a notice, unanimously supporting Premier Zhou's report to the National People's Congress. All members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association and all industrialists and businessmen of the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce express their warm support for Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's report to the Congress, and guarantee that under the leadership of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, they will further strengthen publicity and education work among members of the Democratic National Construction Association and industrialists and businessmen in our province, draw a clear line in politics and ideology, stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, and smash all reactionary activities of the rightists.

    Among the members of the Democratic National Construction Association and industrialists and businessmen in our province, some people have not yet freed themselves from the influence of the rightists. Therefore, in addition to continuing to wage a resolute struggle against the rightists represented by Zhang Naiqi, it is also necessary to educate them to recognize the true face of the rightists, correct ideological errors, and promote their awareness. They must faithfully accept socialist transformation and advance towards the broad road of socialism, and strive for this work goal.

    It is recommended that the government establish and improve enterprise management committees in joint state-private enterprises, clearly stipulate management systems, and be composed of party, government, labor union, and private representatives. Formulate a clear division of labor. Under the leadership of the public representative, the private sector has duties and rights. In order to transform thinking and improve socialist awareness, we should give play to initiative, and more actively and openly consult and handle affairs, and further strengthen learning. Through practice in enterprises and continuous training, we will gradually become genuine laborers.

    This time, helping the Party in its rectification campaign has improved my personal understanding and educated myself. Through the struggle with the rightists, my thinking has become clearer, but I still feel that my learning is very insufficient. In the future, I am willing to further study hard, strengthen my work, resolutely unite around the Party, and actively serve the people better in order to transform myself, temper myself, and gradually become a self-reliant laborer.

    Finally, I guarantee that I will convey the spirit and resolutions of this conference to the masses in our province.

    黑龙江省民建会员和工商业者
    要同右派分子划清界限辨明是非
    刘珮芝的发言
    我在这次大会上听了周总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理、彭真副委员长等的各项报告，并学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，使我受到深刻的体会，给予我们以莫大的鼓舞，进一步认识了伟大的祖国在中国共产党领导下，在建国短短的几年中，在政治、经济、文化、教育、交通、卫生、矿业、工农业生产等等各个方面，莫不获得了空前巨大的辉煌成就。使人更加兴奋的是我国的国际地位空前地提高和我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划即将胜利地完成与超额完成，这个伟大计划使我国社会生活发生了历史性的深刻变化。我完全同意大会上所作的各项报告，并以实际行动为实现贯彻而努力。李副总理报告中曾指出，一九五六年是我国几十年来自然灾害最大的一年。大家都知道，当时各地方灾情严重，防汛、修堤、堵口、工事，是极为紧张的。我们哈尔滨市就是严重灾区之一，当水情严重时，省、市党政负责同志全部住在防汛工地，省、市大小机关停止办公，夜以继日地动员居民全力以赴的进行修堤防汛工作，并调来部分解放军大力协助，终于战胜了洪水。虽然哈市江北松浦区被淹，但区内数万居民均事先救出，未死亡一人。
    一九五六年我国的灾害是最大的一年，但仍比一九五五年增收粮食一百五十多亿斤。因此合作化成绩是伟大的，尤其是我国粮食统购统销，统一调配，使任何灾区都有粮吃；今年灾区又很快的恢复了生产，这充分证明了，社会主义无比的优越性。
    总理报告中对于右派分子借党整风的机会向党的进攻，给予了严肃的批判。明确指出：私营工商业者绝大部分虽然已参加了公私合营，但是由于他们还拿定息，因此还有剥削关系，资产阶级的两面性依然存在。对于有人“主张或者赞成把定息延长二十年”，“想把二十年定息一次付清”，“定息不是剥削，仅仅是不劳而获”，“资产阶级分子和工人阶级已没有本质的差别，资产阶级不需要改造了”，“官僚主义是比资本主义更加危险的敌人”等荒谬错误言论，也一一进行了分析批判。使我们更加清楚地认识了右派分子的反动面目，增加了我们对右派分子斗争的武器；进一步辨明是非，分清敌我，更好地对右派分子进行坚决斗争！
    一个月以来，全国人民响应中国共产党的号召，以爱护党帮助党进一步改进工作的精神，认真地对党提出了批评和意见，受到了党的重视和欢迎。我们工商业者和各界人民一样，认真地发表了自己的意见，积极帮助党整风；但是右派分子利用了这个机会，以帮助党整风作幌子，疯狂地开展了反对党、反对工人阶级和破坏社会主义事业的活动，章乃器就是右派分子突出的一人。
    章乃器在去年冬民建举行二中全会时，他的歪曲谬论已受到同志们的批判。
    最近他利用党整风机会，又发表了一系列的荒谬言论，施放毒素，给与各地方工商业者造成了极其恶劣的影响。同志们对他的错误，再进行了严肃的批判，并善意反复耐心的对他进行帮助，以促其反省，希望他能悬崖勒马；但他坚持他的反社会主义活动，民建、全联两会才采取了措施。
    民建中央、全国工商联已联合发出了通告，一致拥护周总理在全国人民代表大会上的报告，我们黑龙江省民建会全体会员和工商联的全体工商业者对于毛主席的讲演和周总理在大会上的报告表示热诚拥护，并保证在我省中共党委领导下更进一步对于民建会员、工商业者加强宣教工作，在政治上思想上划清界限，站稳立场，辨明是非，粉碎右派分子的一切反动活动。
    在我省的民建成员和工商业者中间有部分人还没有从右派分子的影响下解脱出来，因此，除必须继续同以章乃器为代表的右派分子，进行坚决的斗争外，还必须教育他们认清右派分子的真面目，纠正思想错误，促进他们能够觉悟，必须忠实地接受社会主义改造，向社会主义康庄大道前进，为这一工作目标而努力。
    建议政府在公私合营企业中，建立健全企业管理委员会，明确规定管理制度，由党政工团私组成之。制定明确分工，在公方代表领导下，私方有职有权，为了改造思想，提高社会主义觉悟，应发挥积极性，更主动的努力开诚相见协商办事，进一步加强学习。通过在企业中实践和不断的锻炼，逐步地成为名符其实的劳动者。
    我这次帮助党整风，提高了个人认识，教育了自己，通过和右派分子的斗争，使我的思想更加明确了，但仍感到自己的学习是很不够的，今后愿更进一步地努力学习、加强工作，坚决地团结在党的周围，积极地更好的为人民服务，来改造自己，锻炼自己，使自己逐步地成为自食其力的劳动者。
    最后我表示保证将这次大会的精神和决议贯彻到我省群众中去。
