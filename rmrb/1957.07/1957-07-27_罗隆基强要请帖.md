Luo Longji Forcibly Demands Tickets

To the Editor:

The following exposes aspects of Luo Longji's behavior, but through these instances, one can see the essence of this rightist.

In the past, whenever there were exciting games at the gymnasium, Luo Longji would always ask for tickets, and if he wasn't satisfied, he would get angry. To accommodate him and avoid trouble, the Sports Commission would often proactively send him a ticket. Even so, this difficult-to-please minister was still not satisfied. In June of last year, during a match between the French Labor Federation basketball team and the Chinese national team, Luo Longji called to ask for tickets, and the Sports Commission sent him a front-row ticket in the North Stand. Because it wasn't a ticket for the main stand, Luo Longji flew into a rage, saying, "If you don't want me to watch, just say so! Giving me a North Stand ticket, who will be responsible for the safety of my car parked there!" In fact, many diplomatic officials and heads of various ministries were also sitting in the North Stand.

In August of last year, when the Romanian basketball team came to China for a visit and matches, the gymnasium issued priority ticket purchase notices to accommodate the heads of various ministries, and, of course, Minister Luo Longji received one as well. This minister, who was used to waiting for people to send him tickets, was very unhappy with this notice. He immediately called the General Office of the Sports Commission and said, "I didn't receive a notice, I don't care if the ministry received it or not," "Even if the ministry received it, how would they know I want to watch the game?" "The ticket purchase time is in the newspaper, I don't have time to pay attention to those small advertisements in the newspaper," "Even if I received the notice, I wouldn't have time to buy tickets," and so on. In short, he made it increasingly clear: he didn't want to buy tickets, he wanted complimentary tickets, preferably a pass to the main stand.

In Luo Longji's view, it would be a disgrace for someone as famous as him not to sit in the main stand; if the Sports Commission didn't give him a pass to the main stand, they were too out of touch. Luo Longji's thoughts were not only expressed through his secretary, who said, "He is a level-four minister and should be given a pass to the main stand," but he also directly hinted at it several times in phone calls. Once he said he saw a Communist Party member minister sitting in the main stand, so why couldn't he sit there; another time he said he saw Gao Chongmin holding a pass at the airport, so why wasn't one given to him; one time he simply said directly that he wanted a pass to the main stand, and he also wanted one for Huang Shaohong. In fact, according to our observations, the only special person who often shamelessly insisted on sitting in the main stand with an ordinary ticket was him.

Luo Longji's desire to only feel comfortable sitting in the main stand could not be satisfied due to the limited number of seats in the main stand. This accumulated into uncontrollable anger in his heart time and time again. On the evening of October 14th last year, during a basketball game that was part of the Olympic Games selection trials, the newspaper clearly stated that those with priority purchase cards could buy tickets at the gymnasium from 12:00 noon to 5:00 pm on the 13th, and would not be served after the deadline. Minister Luo insisted on sending someone to buy tickets on the 14th, after the tickets had already been sold out, which was, of course, difficult to resolve. Minister Luo was furious and grabbed the phone to question the Sports Commission: "I'm asking you, why didn't you sell tickets to me! Who decided not to reserve tickets for ministers, was it He Long or Cai Shufan! Who did you sell the front-row tickets to, where did the passes to the main stand go! Your gymnasium staff is simply corrupt, and the Sports Commission leadership is seriously bureaucratic! As a representative of the People's Congress, I'm inspecting your work, and you must immediately report the entire situation to me." (At this point, he asked for the name of the person answering the phone, in order to facilitate the inspection.) "Let me tell you, I'm definitely going to watch today, I'll go in even without a ticket!" With a "bang," he slammed down the phone.

The above-revealed material is only a part of Luo Longji's poor behavior in this regard.

### 罗隆基强要请帖

专栏：读者来信

    罗隆基强要请帖编辑同志：
    这里揭露的虽然是罗隆基作风方面的事情，但是通过这些事情，可以看出这个右派分子的本质。
    过去每逢体育馆有比较精彩的球赛时，罗隆基总来要票，一不如意，就发脾气。为了照顾也是为了减少麻烦，体委会常主动的给他送张票去。就这样，仍然得不到这位难伺候的部长的满意。去年6月间法国劳联篮球队与我国联队的一场比赛，罗隆基打电话来要票，体委就给他送去了一张北台前排的票。因为不是主席台的票，罗隆基就大发脾气说：“不叫我看就算了！给我北台的票，我的汽车放在那里，我的安全谁来负责！”其实，有许多外交官员和各部的首长，也都是坐在北台。
    去年8月间，罗马尼亚的篮球队，来我国访问比赛时，为了照顾各部首长，体育馆特印发了优先购票的通知，当然也无例外的给罗隆基部长发去了一份。这位习惯等人家送票的部长，对于这个通知很不满意，马上给体委办公厅打来个电话，说：“我没有接到通知，部里是否接到了我不管”、“就是部里接到，他们怎么知道我要去看球赛呢？”“购票时间见报纸，我那有时间去注意报纸上那些小广告呢”、“就是我接到通知，又那有时间去买票呢”等等。总之，愈说愈明白：不买票，要赠票，最好给他发张主席台的请帖。
    在罗隆基看来，像他这样一位鼎鼎大名的人物，不坐在主席台上，是丢面子的事；不发给他主席台的请帖，体委也是太不识时务。罗隆基的这点心事，除了通过秘书替他表达说，“他是四级部长，应当发张主席台的请帖”以外，他也直接的打电话透露过几次了。一次说什么他看到有个党员部长坐到主席台上了，为什么他不能坐；一次说什么他在飞机场上见到高崇民拿着一张请帖，为什么就不发给他；一次干脆直接了当的说他要一张主席台的请帖，还要给黄绍竑也要一张。其实，据我们临场所见，时常拿着普通票，死皮赖脸的硬到主席台上坐的，却只有他这样一位特殊的人物。
    罗隆基的这种非坐主席台才舒服的欲望，由于主席台的坐位太少，不能给他解决，这便在他心里一次一次的积下了难以遏制的怒火。去年10月14日晚上举行的参加奥运会选拔赛的一场篮球比赛，报上登着明明白白，持优先购票证者于13日中午十二时至下午五时，到体育馆购票，过时不候。这位罗部长偏在14日下午票已售光的时候，才派人来买票，这当然是很难解决了。罗部长大怒，抓起电话质问体委：“我问你们，为什么不卖票给我！不给部长留票是谁的主张，是贺龙还是蔡树藩！你们把前排的票都卖给谁了，主席台的请贴发到那里去了！你们体育馆的工作人员简直是腐败作风，体委领导是严重的官僚主义！我以人民代表大会代表的资格，检查你们的工作，你们必须马上将全部情况向我报告。”（这时他问了一下接电话的人叫什么名子，以便于检查）“告诉你们今天我一定去看，没有票也要进去！”“光”的一声，摔下了电话。
    以上所揭露的材料，只是罗隆基在这方面所表现的恶劣行为的一部分。
