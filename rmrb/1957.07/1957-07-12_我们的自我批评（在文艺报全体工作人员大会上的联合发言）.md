Our Self-Criticism
(Joint Speech at the General Meeting of All Staff of the Wenyi Bao)
Zhang Guangnian, Editor-in-Chief of Wenyi Bao; Hou Jinjing, Deputy Editor-in-Chief; Chen Xiaoyu

In May and June, precisely when the bourgeois rightists launched a frantic attack nationwide, and the internal contradictions of this newspaper also became extremely acute, a batch of poisonous weeds was released from our weekly; including articles reflecting rightist ideas, inflammatory reports, and bourgeois tabloid-style personal attacks. Of course, some of the poisonous weeds were released consciously by us, in preparation for criticism; but some were not. We did not promptly recognize the harmfulness of some poisonous weeds, nor did we promptly organize powerful rebuttals. Under the pressure of rightist ideas and right-leaning sentiments within the editorial department, we made some compromises and concessions that we should not have made. On these issues, it was essentially a shameful surrender to bourgeois ideology!

We conducted a comprehensive review of the publications from the seventh issue onwards, and now we are making a responsible explanation here.

(1) The following articles can be seen at a glance as reflecting rightist ideas: Issue 7: "Speaking Frankly by Opening the Window"; Issue 8: "There Seems to Be People Who Are Always Right"; Issue 9: "I Raise My Head and Stick Out My Chest to Join the Battle!"; Issue 10: "A Suddenly Realized Smile"; "Who Does the People's Literature Publishing House Serve?"; Issue 11: "From the Encounter of an Essay to the Question of 'Things Were Better in the Past.'"

(2) The following articles are inflammatory reports and articles: Issue 9: "Can We Lead a Theater Troupe in the Way We Lead Troops?"; "After the Publication of Comrade Zhang Quan's Article 'About Me'"; "A Letter to Comrade Liu Zhiming"; Issue 10: "Voices Muffled Under the Lid"; Issue 11: "The First Voice of Changchun Film Studio"; "Chiefs Visit the Peking Opera Theater for the First Time."

In addition, the three reports on Issue 8, "Let the Singers and Instrumentalists Sing Out!", Issue 11, "The Writers Association Widely Opens Channels for Speech During Rectification"; and Issue 12, "The Sound of Seeking Friends," made objectivist reports on some of the wrong speeches, causing a negative impact.

When publishing articles by military writers exposing contradictions in Issues 10 and 11, the use of the headline "Let Military Writers Be Liberated from the Rules and Regulations" was deliberately sensational and inflammatory.

(3) Our "Literary Tea House" has been criticized by literary circles and readers. Of course, it has also been applauded by another group of people with strange voices. Although not all the articles in the "Tea House" are bad, articles such as "It's Easy to Handle Things with Our Own People," "Fan-Shaped Zone," "An Actor's Visit," "A Record of a Private Conversation," "Record of Silencing," and "Ten Times the Value" are by no means criticisms with good intentions, and must be said to be bourgeois tabloid-style personal attacks. Among them, "It's Easy to Handle Things with Our Own People" and "Record of Silencing" launched indiscriminate and malicious attacks on the People's Literature Publishing House, and were clearly ill-intentioned.

(4) In addition, there are some articles, such as "Realism, or Formalism?" and "Can Cumbersome Formulas Guide Creation?" We cannot agree with certain arguments in these two articles about creating new heroic figures, especially about the views on ideal figures. These types of issues can be discussed as academic issues over a longer period of time.

From the seventh issue to the fifteenth issue, our publication published nearly two hundred articles, large and small, many of which are good articles. During the rectification period, comrades inside and outside the Party criticized dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy, or speeches at symposiums, most of which were good and necessary, although we cannot completely agree with some opinions, we still welcome and appreciate them. These must not be confused with rightist ideas and inflammatory remarks.

However, as a Marxist literary criticism publication, just when the sky was filled with dark clouds some time ago, we also published some things that were comparable to the poisonous weeds in Wenhui Bao. How did this happen?

It should be explained here: some poisonous weeds were released consciously. Like the first category of articles mentioned above, and the two articles in the "Tea House" attacking the People's Publishing House, some were released as poisonous weeds, and some were seen in the proofs, or after publication, and were considered bad articles that we were going to refute. Of course, there were one or two articles for which we did not see the depth of its harm at the time; at the same time, due to the sharp contradictions within the editorial department, our hands and feet were tied, and we did not organize a rebuttal in a timely manner. Now we should immediately correct this mistake and automatically float to the surface.

Our main mistake was making compromises on several inflammatory reports by our newspaper's reporters, and agreeing to publish the articles in "Literary Tea House" other than "It's Easy to Handle Things with Our Own People" and "Record of Silencing" because we thought the "problems were not big."

I would like to specifically talk about the reports of our newspaper's reporters. Of course, our reporters are very hardworking, and some reports are good, or the problems are not big, but there are also inflammatory reports, especially "The First Voice of Changchun Film Studio," which is very inflammatory. We did not see this report in advance, and actually agreed to publish it in the most prominent position on the cover. Later, when we read it in the proofs, we felt it was inappropriate, but we were afraid that major changes would delay the publication date, so we only told the art department to make individual modifications and still published it. It should be said that this is irresponsible and a serious dereliction of duty.

We should especially talk about "Literary Tea House." This was opened up at the cadre meeting for improving work, accepting the suggestions of some comrades. However, there was a lack of specific arrangements for the direction and content of this column, and a lack of due vigilance about its impact and consequences. This column actually surpassed Wenhui Bao. Some low-taste, harmful and useless for rectification, and personally attacking things were thrown out of this column. We always said that the nature of this column should be changed, and we and the editing comrades of the "Tea House" have made plans, but we have not resolutely promoted its realization. This is also our mistake, which has caused great losses to our cause. Every comrade who has a sense of responsibility to the Party and the literary cause cannot help but feel heartbroken when they think about it. We have already told the editing comrades of this column that the future "Tea House" should make up for its past mistakes and should become a sharp soldier in exposing rightists and rightist ideas.

In the previous period, rightist ideas represented by Tang Yin and Tang Dacheng launched a fierce challenge to us; at the same time, the bourgeois style of Wenhui Bao influenced a large number of comrades in our editorial department, and the internal contradictions of the editorial department were very sharp. It can be said that our struggle was quite arduous. However, can our mistakes be excused because of this? Isn't it precisely in the most difficult times that Communist Party members need to stick to their positions? However, when the internal and external struggles were very tense, we abandoned some important positions. In order to seek formal unity and avoid the division of the editorial department, we made certain compromises and concessions to rightist ideas and rightist sentiments, and showed a shameful surrender of losing the Marxist-Leninist stand in some work! Last year, we made a serious mistake in the publication of "The Gongs and Drums of Cinema," and the Party Central Committee rang the alarm for us, but we did not learn a profound lesson from it. This shows that right-leaning ideas have also eroded our minds to a certain extent, and we cannot withstand strict tests on every issue. Although we have always carried out a sharp struggle against rightist ideas, we have made mistakes on some issues and have failed to live up to the trust of the Party and the people.

Comrades! Don't be discouraged! Now our task is, on the one hand, to pick up the hoe and hoe out the poisonous weeds we released with our own hands, and on the other hand, to set up a battle formation and launch an irreconcilable struggle with rightists and rightist ideas. Let us further test ourselves in this struggle. Comrades, stand firmly with the Party!

    我们的自我批评
    （在文艺报全体工作人员大会上的联合发言）
    文艺报总编辑　张光年　副总编辑　侯金镜　陈笑雨
    5、6月间，就是当资产阶级右派在全国范围内展开了猖狂进攻、本报内部矛盾也闹得非常尖锐化的时候，从我们的周刊上，放出了一批毒草；其中包括反映了右派思想的文章，煽动性的报道，和资产阶级小报式的、进行人身攻击的短文。当然，有些毒草是我们有意识地放出的，准备批驳的；但有些却不是这样。我们对有些毒草没有及时认清它的危害性，没有及时组织有力的反驳。在编辑部右派思想和右倾情绪的压力下，我们做了一些不应该有的妥协和让步。在这些问题上，实质上是对资产阶级思想的可耻的投降！
    我们对第七期以后的刊物做了一次全面的检查，现在在这里做出负责的交代。
      （一）可以一眼看出来是反映了右派思想的文章，有以下几篇：第七期：“打开窗户说亮话”；第八期：“有种好像永远都是正确的人”；第九期：“我昂起头，挺起胸来，投入战斗！”；第十期：“豁然开朗的笑容”；“人民文学出版社为谁服务？”；第十一期：“从一篇杂文的遭遇谈到‘今不如昔’的问题”。
    （二）煽动性的报道和文章有以下几篇：第九期：“能用带兵的方式带剧团吗？”；“张权同志的‘关于我’一文发表以后”；“致刘芝明同志”；第十期：“闷在盖子里的声音”；第十一期：“长影的第一个声音”；“首长首次到京剧院去”。
    此外，第八期上“让歌唱家演奏家们，鸣起来吧！”、第十一期上“作协在整风中广开言路”；第十二期上“嘤嘤求友声”这三篇报道，对部分的错误发言做了客观主义的报道，造成了不良影响。
    在第十期、第十一期发表部队作家揭露矛盾的文章的时候，连续用了“让部队作家从清规戒律里解放出来”的大标题，也是故意耸人听闻的，带有煽动性的。
    （三）我们的“文艺茶座”受到文艺界和读者的责难。当然，它也受到另外一部分人的怪声叫好。“茶座”里虽然并不都是坏文章，但是像“自己人都好办”、“扇形地带”、“演员求见记”、“一次个别谈话实录”、“封嘴记”、“身价十倍”等篇，都决不是与人为善的批评，都不能不说是资产阶级小报式的、进行人身攻击的东西。其中“自己人都好办”和“封嘴记”，对人民文学出版社进行了不分清红皂白的恶意攻击，显然是来意不善的。
    （四）另外还有一些文章，像“现实主义、还是公式主义？”“烦琐的公式可以指导创作吗？”这两篇文章中关于创造新英雄人物的某些论点，特别是关于理想人物的看法，我们是不能同意的。这类问题，可以在较长时期内当做学术问题来讨论。
    从第七期到第十五期为止，我们的刊物上发表了大大小小近两百篇文章，其中很多是好文章。在整风期间，党内外同志对教条主义、宗派主义、官僚主义进行批评，或在座谈会上的发言，绝大部分也是好的，必要的，尽管有些意见我们不能完全同意，我们至今仍然是欢迎的，感谢的。这些决不能和右派思想和煽动性的言论混为一谈。
    但是我们作为一个马克思主义的文艺评论刊物，正当前些时天空闹得乌云乱飞的时候，我们也发表了一些和文汇报上的毒草不相上下的东西，这到底是怎么一回事呢？
    应当在这里说明：有些毒草是有意识地放出来的。像前面举的第一类的文章，和“茶座”中攻击人民出版社的两篇文章，有的是当成毒草放的，有的是在大样上看到了，或出版以后看到了，认为是不好的文章，也是要准备反驳的。当然，其中有一两篇文章，我们对它的毒害当时没有看得很深切；同时，由于编辑部内部的尖锐矛盾拖住了我们的手脚，我们没有及时地组织反驳。现在应当立即来纠正这个错误，自动浮到水面上来。
    我们的主要错误是对本报记者的几篇带有煽动性的报道作了妥协，对“文艺茶座”里除“自己人都好办”、“封嘴记”以外的几篇文章，认为“问题不大”而同意发表了。
    我想特别谈谈本报记者的报道。当然，我们的记者是很辛苦的，有些报道是好的，或问题不大的，但也有煽动性的报道，特别是“长影的第一个声音”是带有很大煽动性的。这篇报道我们事先没有看到，居然同意发表在封面的最突出的地位。后来在大样上读到了，觉得不妥，又怕更动太大，延误出版日期，就仅仅告诉艺术部做了个别地方的修改仍然发表了。应当说，这是不负责任的，严重的失职行为。
    应当特别谈谈“文艺茶座。”这是在改进工作的干部会议上，我们接受某些同志的建议而开辟的。但是对这一栏的方针和内容，缺乏具体的安排，对它的影响和后果，也缺乏应有的警惕。这一栏，实际赛过了文汇报。从这一栏里抛出了一些低级趣味的、对整风有害无益的、进行人身攻击的东西。我们总说这一栏的性质要转，要改变，并且和“茶座”的编辑同志订出了计划，但是没有坚决地促其实现。这也是我们的错误，对我们的事业是造成了很大损失的。每一个对党、对文艺事业有责任心的同志，想起来是不能不痛心的。我们已经和这一栏的编辑同志说过了，今后的“茶座”应当将功折罪，应当成为揭露右派分子和右派思想的尖兵。
    在前一个时期，以唐因、唐达成为代表的右派思想向我们进行了猛烈的挑战；同时，文汇报的资产阶级作风影响了我们编辑部的很大部分同志，编辑部的内部矛盾十分尖锐，可以说，我们的斗争是相当艰苦的。但是，难道因为这样可以原谅我们的错误吗？不正是在最艰难的时候才需要共产党员来坚持自己的阵地吗？可是我们在内外斗争非常紧张的时候，却放弃了某些重要阵地，为了求得形式上的团结，避免编辑部的分裂，对右派思想和右派情绪做了某些妥协和让步，在一部分工作上表现了失掉马克思列宁主义立场的、可耻的投降！去年，我们在发表“电影的锣鼓”的问题上犯过严重的错误，党中央对我们敲过警钟，我们没有从中取得深刻的教训。这说明右倾思想也在一定程度上侵蚀了我们的头脑，我们并不是在每个问题上都能经得住严格的考验。我们虽然一直和右派思想进行了尖锐的斗争，但是在有些问题上，我们犯了错误，辜负了党和人民对我们的信托。
    同志们！决不要灰心丧气！现在我们的任务是，一方面拿起锄头，锄掉我们亲手放出来的毒草，一方面摆开阵势，和右派分子、和右派思想展开不调和的斗争。让我们在这一场斗争中进一步地考验自己。同志们，坚决地和党站在一起吧！
