The proposal made on the 21st of this month by National People's Congress representatives Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Yuan Xuefen, Chang Xiangyu, Chen Shufang, and Lang Xianfen, demanding the improvement of the ideological and artistic quality of opera, more performances of excellent and educational plays, and the cessation of performing ugly, obscene, terrifying, and harmful bad plays that damage the people's physical and mental health, is correct. We, the veteran Kunqu opera artists, completely support and endorse this proposal.

Since the Second National Opera Repertoire Conference, the opening up of previously banned plays has brought a new flourishing phenomenon to the opera art scene. Many artists are actively excavating, sorting out, and researching the excellent traditional repertoire in the heritage. Some of the plays have been warmly welcomed by the audience during performances, indicating that not only fragrant flowers exist, but also many similar things are waiting for us to inherit. However, there are also a small number of artists who do not start from the perspective of inheriting and developing the opera art. They indiscriminately and uncritically revive plays that were previously banned. These plays are indeed of low ideological and artistic quality, have little educational significance, and are even ugly and highly poisonous bad plays. For example, what do plays like "Killing Son for Revenge" and "Yellow Lady's Perilous Journey" offer to the audience? But they do not consider these things and are not responsible for art. They want to take advantage of the opportunity of opening up the repertoire to spread those bad plays that have been abandoned by the people among the masses, only caring about the profits from the performances and not considering the consequences. This approach misunderstands the meaning of opening up the repertoire, causing some confusion and unhealthy state in the flourishing phenomenon of opera art, and arousing great dissatisfaction among the audience. We believe that today, as an opera artist, we must not only be responsible for art, but more importantly, be responsible for the audience. We bear the heavy responsibility of educating and promoting social progress. If we only regard art as an "object for entertainment" and the audience as "consumers" of art, and treat them casually, this is an unacceptable attitude, and we disagree with doing so.

We agree with the proposal put forward by Mei Lanfang and other comrades to the opera community and are willing to pledge that we will resolutely not perform bad plays. We must carefully study and discuss the plays to be staged, and never give poisonous plays to the audience. We will also persist in fighting and opposing all bad plays that are staged. We also hope that the opera community will strengthen unity, and with everyone's efforts, we will remove those bad plays that poison the people from the opera stage more quickly, so as to clarify the past chaotic state of distinguishing fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds, and make the opera art better serve the broad masses of people in socialist construction.

    我们坚决反对演坏戏
    本月21日，全国人民代表大会代表梅兰芳、周信芳、程砚秋、袁雪芬、常香玉、陈书舫和郎咸芬等同志提出的，要求提高戏曲的思想质量和艺术质量，多演有教育意义的优秀剧目，不演丑恶、淫猥、恐怖、有害人民身心健康的坏戏。这一号召是正确的，我们昆曲老艺人完全护拥和支持这个建议。
    自从第二次全国戏曲剧目工作会议之后，以前禁演的剧目开放以来，戏曲艺术事业呈现出新的繁荣现象，很多艺人都在积极地挖掘、整理和研究着遗产中的优秀传统剧目，有的剧目已在演出中受到了观众的热烈欢迎，说明了不但是香花，而且类似这样的东西还很有，正有待于我们去继承。但是，也有小部分艺人，他们却不是从继承与发展戏曲艺术事业的观点出发，他们毫无选择和批判地来搬演过去曾经禁演的剧目，而这些剧目又的确是思想质量和艺术质量不高、教育意义不大，甚至丑恶不堪、毒素很大的坏戏。如：“杀子报”和“黄氏女游险”之类，究竟给观众的是些什么呢？可是他们并不考虑这些，对艺术并不负责任。他们想趁着剧目开放的机会，把那些被人民所摈弃的坏戏散播在群众中，只顾演出的赢利，却不顾所造成的后果。这种做法误解了剧目开放的意义，造成了戏曲艺术事业繁荣现象中的某些混乱与不健康状态，引起了观众极大的不满。我们认为今天做为一个戏曲艺人，不但要对艺术负责，更重要的是要对观众负责，我们身负教育和推动社会前进的重担，如果只把艺术当做任人“消遣的物品”，把观众当做是对艺术的“消遣者”，就可以随便地去对待它们，这是不应该有的态度，我们是不同意这样做的。
    我们同意梅兰芳等同志向戏曲界提出的建议，并愿意相约，自己坚决不演坏戏。对上演的剧目，一定要经过慎重研究和讨论，决不拿有毒素的剧目去给观众看，对上演的一切坏戏，我们也一定坚持斗争和反对。我们还希望戏曲界加强团结起来，在大家的努力下，把那些毒害人民的坏戏更快地从戏曲舞台上除掉，以澄清已往香花和毒草不分的混乱状态，使得戏曲事业更能为社会主义建设中的广大人民去服务。
