    Eliminate the Poison Spread by Qian Weichang
    Wang Tan, Professor of Tsinghua University
    During the rightists' frenzied attacks, the rightists in cultural, educational, and scientific circles were the most rampant. They betrayed the Party's care and love for scientists, relied on the status and honor given to them by the working people, and took advantage of some vague consciousness among intellectuals and the lack of experience and isolation from the old era among young intellectuals. Taking advantage of the rectification movement, they vigorously incited and spread anti-socialist fallacies, attempting to achieve their political conspiracy of first seizing leadership in cultural, educational, and scientific circles. This delusion has been exposed and severely attacked by the people of the whole country. Their conspiracy has failed, their ambitions have been exposed, and they are already in the midst of denunciations from all directions.
    Qian Weichang, a rightist in cultural, educational, and scientific circles, has long been spreading poison in the ideological field of intellectuals, trying to drag cultural, educational, and scientific research work onto the capitalist road, ruining the socialist future of all of us.
    In recent years, the country has carried out fundamental reforms of the old education it took over, and the achievements have been enormous. However, Qian Weichang believes that "since the adjustment of departments, this atmosphere of self-study from top to bottom, from teachers to students, has been completely destroyed, which is a great loss" (June 18, 1957, Tsinghua student dazibao: "We Interviewed Vice President Qian"), "The work initiative of college graduates is generally very poor; everything waits for people to teach them by hand, and everything relies on opening training classes" (January 7, 1957, Guangming Daily, "Qian Weichang on the Training Objectives of Higher Industrial Schools"). He even so belittles the achievements of our teaching reform, saying that college graduates rely entirely on opening training classes! Then what is his opinion? Although he did not say it clearly, it can be clearly seen that there is a difference in the line. He wants us to take the capitalist road.
    He tried his best to render the emotion of "now is not as good as before", saying that "China's old education system was neither British nor American, nor German nor Japanese, but a set of things pieced together by China itself" (May 31, 1957, speech at the Tsinghua student free forum). "Before liberation, some schools had their own study style, such as Zhejiang University being good at theory... At that time, students lived very freely... The atmosphere of self-study"; at the same time, he looked down on the Soviet experience, saying, "There are too many Soviet engineers, and there is a lack of new technology in industry. This is due to inertia and the limitations of planning. In teaching, too much emphasis is placed on graduation design, and everything serves graduation design. Although the Soviet Union has a strong technical force, its development potential is not great!" (January 1957, speech at the first symposium on revising the teaching plan of the Ministry of Higher Education) He opposed the planned training of talents. He said: "We are not saying that we cannot divide it more finely and set goals to train according to plan under any circumstances. However, this is only possible when industrial development is relatively fixed and develops at a constant ratio, and there are no revolutionary changes in technology... But the specific situation of our country is not like this" (January 31, 1957, People's Daily, "The Training Objectives of Higher Industrial Schools"). He believes that training "engineers" is not realistic, "In higher engineering schools, the three courses of mathematics, physics, and chemistry should be the main ones" (January 7, 1957, Guangming Daily, "Qian Weichang on the Training Objectives of Higher Industrial Schools").
    In summary, isn't his intention clear! No to the Soviet Union! Yes to Britain, the United States, Germany, and Japan! As the vice president of Tsinghua University, his influence is both deep and broad. Some young people have accepted his arguments and have doubted the achievements of teaching reform, proposing the opinion of being willing to learn foreign languages and not planning to complete graduation designs; not attaching importance to construction technology, building materials and other courses, thinking that these are all empirical knowledge, which will be encountered in actual work; not attaching importance to production internships; even looking down on engineers, "people's hearts are toward the academy"; how dangerous this is!
    Higher industrial schools train economic construction cadres needed by socialism. Among them are scientists, but also a large number of engineers who contribute their lifelong strength to practical work. If young intellectuals are all influenced by Qian Weichang and do not accept being trained as "engineers," wouldn't it hinder our socialist future! In fact, he himself understands that industry needs talents in various categories, and the old-fashioned general education cannot meet this need; it is also unrealistic to send graduates who only master mathematics, physics, and chemistry to our country's current industry, which has a very weak foundation, to be trained into various specialized talents. His contradictory arguments in recent years can only be said to be with ulterior motives!
    Qian's rendering of "now is not as good as before" is not in accordance with the facts. He is not the only one who has been through it. Who can forget the old education with a dropout rate of 50%-60%, and by the time they were about to graduate, they were either wearing deep glasses or suffering from lung disease! Even so, there were still many "defective products leaving the factory," and "graduation is unemployment"! Speaking of the atmosphere of self-study, it immediately reminds people of the analogy of "the grass is in front, and the whip is behind." Today, the few well-known scientists we can see mark the countless struggling scholars who had no way out in the past! Do we still want to sing the praises of these days and encourage everyone to go backwards!
    Qian Weichang's opposition to the planned training of talents is exactly the same as his advocacy in the "Science Program" that "research work" and "funding" should be "based on people," which is a thorough anti-socialist argument that opposes adapting to the needs of the country.
    The educational reform line of the rightist Qian Weichang is extremely harmful and must be resolutely criticized. While his political conspiracy and the Zhang-Luo alliance are being destroyed, the poison he spread in the ideological field of intellectuals will inevitably be thoroughly eliminated by this struggle. Let us draw a clear line, raise our awareness, and contribute our strength under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to the education needed for our country's socialist transformation and socialist construction.

    清除钱伟长散布的毒素
    清华大学教授　汪坦
    在右派分子疯狂进攻里，文教科学界的右派分子是最为猖狂的。他们背弃了党对科学家的关怀爱护，凭借了劳动人民给他们的地位和荣誉，利用了知识分子的一些模糊意识及青年知识分子缺乏经验和对旧时代的隔阂，趁着整风的机会，大肆煽动，散布反社会主义谬论，妄想达到他们首先夺取文教科学界的领导权的政治阴谋。这种妄想已经为全国人民所揭穿，给予痛击，他们阴谋破产，野心毕露，已经处于四面八方声讨里。
    文教科学界的右派分子钱伟长，长久以来就在知识分子思想领域内散布毒素，要把文教科学研究工作拉上资本主义道路，断送我们大家的社会主义前程。
    几年来，国家对接收过来的旧教育进行了根本性的改革，成绩是巨大的。然而钱伟长却认为“院系调整以来，把这种从上到下，从教师到同学的这种自己钻研的风气全打垮了，这是一个很大的损失”（1957年6月18日清华学生大字报：“我们访问了钱副校长”），
  “高等学校毕业生的工作主动性一般很差；一切都等待着人去把着手教，一切依赖于开训练班”（1957年1月7日，光明日报“钱伟长谈高等工业学校的培养目标问题”）。他竟如此贬低我们教学改革的成果，说成高等学校毕业生一切依赖于开训练班！那末他的意见究竟是怎样呢？他自己虽然没有明说，却可以清楚地看到这里存在着路线上的分歧，他要我们走资本主义的道路。
    他竭力渲染“今不如昔”的情绪，说“中国的旧教育制度，既非英美，又非德日，而是一套拼凑起来的中国自己的东西”（1957年5月31日在清华学生自由论坛上的讲话）。“解放前，有些学校都有自己的学风，像浙大擅长理论……当时学生生活很自由……自己钻研的风气”；同时又看不起苏联的经验，他说，“苏联的工程师太多了，在工业中缺乏新的技术。这是由于惰性和计划的限制，在教学中太钻毕业设计了，一切都服务于毕业设计，苏联的技术力量虽强，但发展潜力不大！”（1957年1月在高教部第一次修订教学计划座谈会上的发言）他反对按计划培养人材。他说：“我们并不是说在什么情况下都不能分得较细，订定目标，来按计划培养的。但是，这只有在工业发展比较定型的情况下，按不变的比例发展着，技术上没有什么革命性的变化时才是可能的。……但是，我们国家的具体情况不是这样的”（1957年1月31日，人民日报“高等工业学校的培养目标问题”）。他认为培养“工程师”不现实，“在高等工科学校中，应当以数、理、化三门课为主”（1957年1月7日，光明日报“钱伟长谈高等工业学校的培养目标问题”）。
    综上所述，他的意图还不清楚么！不要苏联！要英美德日！作为清华大学副校长，他的影响是既深且广的，部分青年就接受了他这些论点，曾怀疑教学改革的成就，提出了情愿学外文，不打算完成毕业设计的意见；不重视施工技术建筑材料等课程，认为这些都是经验性的知识，到实际工作中一碰就会；不重视生产实习；甚至于看不起工程师，“人心向院”；这是何等危险！
    高等工业学校所培养的是社会主义所需要的经济建设干部，中间有科学家，更有大量不辞辛劳贡献出毕生力量在实际工作中的工程师，如果青年知识分子都受了钱伟长的影响，不接受被当作“工程师”的培养，岂不阻碍了我们的社会主义前程！其实他自己是懂得工业需要分门别类的人材，而旧式通才教育是不能满足这一需要的；把只掌握数理化的毕业生送到基础非常薄弱的我国目前工业中去培养成各项专门人材也是不现实的。他近年来反来倒去自相矛盾的论点，只能说是别有用心！
    钱所渲染的“今不如昔”，是不符合事实的。过来人不是只有他一个人，谁能忘记淘汰率高达50％—60％的旧式教育，到了快毕业的时候，不是戴了深度眼镜，就是患了肺病！即使这样，“出厂的废品”还是不少，“毕业就是失业”！说起自己钻研的风气，立刻令人想到“草儿在前，鞭儿在后”的比方。如今我们所能看到零星的几个知名科学家，却标志着过去的多少千万个走头无路的苦学之士！难道还要歌颂这些日子，鼓动大家走回头路么！
    钱伟长的反对按计划培养人材，和他在“科学纲领”中主张“研究工作”和“经费”都应该“就人”是完全一样的，是反对适应国家需要的彻头彻尾反社会主义的论点。
    右派分子钱伟长的教育改革路线，为害是极为严重的，必须坚决予以批判。在他的政治阴谋和章罗联盟毁灭的同时，他散布在知识分子思想领域中的毒素，必然也为这项斗争所彻底清除。让我们划清界限，提高觉悟，在中国共产党领导下，为适应我们国家社会主义改造和社会主义建设所需要的教育而贡献出自己的力量。
