Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd—The Fourth Session of the First National People's Congress listened this afternoon to the "Report on the Work of the Supreme People's Court" by Dong Biwu, President of the Supreme People's Court, and the work report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress by Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National people's Congress, on behalf of the Standing Committee. At today's meeting, the general discussion began.

Today, Dong Biwu focused on reporting to the Congress on the work of the Supreme People's Court from January to May 1957 and the current situation in national adjudication work.

Dong Biwu said that the total number of first-instance criminal and civil cases accepted by people's courts at all levels nationwide last year decreased by about one-third compared with 1955, among which criminal cases decreased significantly, with counter-revolutionary cases decreasing by more than 40%. In the first quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of last year, civil cases increased slightly, while criminal cases continued to decline. Dong Biwu pointed out that the decline in criminal cases marks a reduction in crime in our country, especially marking that counter-revolutionary forces have been basically eliminated. However, it should never be concluded from this that the remnants of counter-revolution and bad elements who disrupt social order will soon be completely eliminated. He said that struggling against all criminal phenomena and continuing to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship remains the top priority task of the people's courts.

Dong Biwu refuted the absurd arguments of the rightists who attacked judicial reform and criticized our judges for not understanding their profession. He pointed out that earnestly studying Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," earnestly carrying out the rectification movement, and carrying out the struggle against the rightists politically and ideologically are extremely important political tasks for people's courts at all levels.

In his work report on behalf of the Standing Committee, Peng Zhen reported on the various tasks carried out by the Standing Committee in the year since the closing of the Third Session of the First National People's Congress until now.

Following this, the general discussion began. The National People's Congress representatives who spoke at the meeting today included Chen Jiageng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Zhu Shunyu, Shanghai industrial labor model; Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society; Shao Xianghua, chief engineer of Anshan Iron and Steel Company; and Zhang Huiting, Anhui agricultural labor model.

Today's executive chairmen of the meeting were Luo Ronghuan, Li Xuefeng, Rong Yiren, Cui Jiangong, Shu Sheyu, Li Jinxi, Sangjiyuexi, and Zhu Shunyu.

A total of 955 representatives attended today's meeting.

Today's meeting began at 3:00 PM and ended at 5:30 PM.

    全国人民代表大会第四次会议
    听取两个报告　开始大会讨论
    董必武在报告中指出：巩固人民民主专政是头等重要任务
    据新华社2日讯　第一届全国人民代表大会第四次会议今天下午听取了最高人民法院院长董必武作的“关于最高人民法院工作的报告”，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长兼秘书长彭真代表常务委员会作的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。在今天的会议上，开始大会讨论。
    董必武今天着重向大会报告了最高人民法院1957年1月至5月的工作和当前全国审判工作方面的情况。
    董必武说，去年全国各级人民法院受理第一审刑事、民事案件的总数比1955年下降约三分之一，其中显著下降的是刑事案件，反革命案件下降40％以上。今年第一季度比去年第一季度，民事案件略有上升，而刑事案件仍有下降。董必武指出，刑事案件的下降，标志着我国犯罪现象的减少，特别是标志着反革命势力已经基本上肃清。但是，决不能由此得出结论，说反革命残余和破坏社会秩序的坏分子很快就会完全趋于消灭。他说，同一切犯罪现象作斗争，继续巩固人民民主专政，仍是人民法院的头等重要任务。
    董必武驳斥了右派分子攻击司法改革和批评我们审判员不懂业务等的荒谬论调。他指出，认真学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演，认真开展整风运动和在政治上、思想上反右派的斗争，是当前各级人民法院的一项十分重要的政治任务。
    彭真在他代表常务委员会所作的工作报告中，报告了常务委员会从第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议闭幕以后到现在一年来所进行的各项工作。
    接着，大会讨论开始。今天在大会上发言的全国人民代表大会代表，有人民政协全国委员会副主席陈嘉庚、上海工业劳动模范朱顺余、九三学社主席许德珩、鞍山钢铁公司总工程师邵象华、安徽农业劳动模范张会亭。
    今天会议执行主席是罗荣桓、李雪峰、荣毅仁、崔建功、舒舍予、黎锦熙、桑吉悦希、朱顺余。
    今天出席会议的代表共九百五十五人。
    今天会议在下午三时开始，五时三十分结束。
