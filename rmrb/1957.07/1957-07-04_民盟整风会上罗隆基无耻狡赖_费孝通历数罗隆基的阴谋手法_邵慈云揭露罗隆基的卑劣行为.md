    (Our dispatch) At the third rectification forum held by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League on the night of July 3, Fei Xiaotong exposed Luo Longji's rightist tactics; he also read a letter from Luo Longji's secretary, Shao Ciyun, exposing Luo Longji's various base behaviors. Luo Longji continued to use a hostile attitude to deny his anti-communist and anti-socialist conspiracy activities. At the beginning of this forum, Hu Yuzhi, who presided over the meeting, announced that Luo Longji was responsible for explaining the following issues: 1. How to control Wenhui Daily through Pu Xixiu; 2. The issue of discussing his speech draft with Chu Anping in advance; 3. The situation of the small clique; 4. The Zhang-Luo alliance issue. However, Luo Longji did not make any explanations. Luo Longji used trivial and exhausting sophistry to waste everyone's time. His explanation began at 7:45 p.m. and was stopped at 9:30 p.m. In nearly two hours of speaking, he did not explain any facts, and he refused to admit even the materials that everyone had already exposed and confirmed. At the beginning, he said that he wanted to explain an important issue. He said that after he proposed the establishment of a rehabilitation committee at the United Front Work Department's symposium, he received 170 letters, of which more than 130 were about the rehabilitation committee issue. When his secretary asked him how to deal with these letters, he instructed the secretary to reply to the letters supporting the rehabilitation committee: "Please create public opinion in all aspects and suggest it to the United Front Work Department and the National Committee of the CPPCC." In fact, this was not Luo Longji's explanation. Shi Liang had already exposed him on this issue at the last forum. Today, he helplessly admitted this fact, but did not further discuss what his attempt was in doing so, and what other plans he had, etc.
    When talking about the issue of how to control Wenhui Daily through Pu Xixiu, Luo Longji talked about many unimportant irrelevant things, and fundamentally denied the serious issue that Xu Zhucheng and others had exposed, which was using Wenhui Daily through Pu Xixiu. He even downplayed some undeniable important facts as a few inappropriate words. When Qian Jiaju stood up to question him whether the People's Daily editorial's criticism of Wenhui Daily was a fact, Luo Longji cunningly said, "I don't express my opinion. If I say that I didn't control Wenhui Daily, you will say that I am quibbling; if I want to admit it, I don't want to put a label on myself indiscriminately." Regarding Chu Anping's fallacy of "the party's world," Chu Anping had already admitted at the group meeting of the National People's Congress that the issues in his speech had been discussed with Luo Longji in advance. However, when Luo Longji explained this issue, he still tried his best to quibble, sometimes saying that their opinions were inconsistent when talking about the "old monk and the little monk" issue, and sometimes saying that Chu Anping did not say that he would speak at the United Front Work Department that day, etc. When Zhang Manjun and Shi Liang were so angered by his quibbling that they could not bear it, they announced Chu Anping's speech at the NPC group meeting, especially Shi Liang pointed out that the current issue is not whether to look at the speech draft, but whether Chu Anping discussed with you and was influenced by you. Afterwards, Luo Longji continued to deny it to the end, saying that facts are always facts, and I won't argue anymore.
    Regarding Luo Longji's reactionary sectarian activities, everyone has already exposed many facts. However, when Luo Longji explained this issue, he first said that he had not prepared in advance, and now he couldn't remember it, and couldn't explain it. Then he said that he was referring to the small clique two or three years ago, and denied the sectarian activities in the past two years. When someone in the meeting asked him to explain the materials exposed by Lu Yi of the Shanghai Xinwen Daily, he cunningly used some unimportant things to perfunctorily deal with everyone, or explained and shirked some facts, or said that he couldn't remember some issues. Someone raised a question to question him, but he avoided answering and instead counterattacked others, saying: "Even if Lu Yi of Shanghai said it, I would ask him to provide evidence." And he repeatedly said, "If there are small clique activities, you can kill my head." At this time, the people at the meeting were so angered by Luo Longji's hostile attitude of refusing to explain that they could no longer bear it. Shi Liang rebuked him, saying, "You keep saying kill your head, this is a hooligan attitude." Min Ganghou said, "When you defend yourself, you speak so clearly. When you are asked to explain the list of the small clique, you say you have forgotten. Now I will announce it for you." Min Ganghou immediately announced that Luo Longji's small clique included: Zeng Zhaolun, Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, Wu Jingchao, Fan Puzhai, Zhang Zhihe, Ye Duyi, Pan Dakui, Liu Wang Liming, Zhang Dongsun, and Zhou Jingwen; Luo Longji's strongholds were Pan Dakui in the southwest, Wang Wenguang in Taiyuan, Jiang Zhenzhong in Zhejiang, Peng Wenyin and Chen Renbing in Shanghai, and Du Maizhi in Hunan, and Ma Zhemin in Hubei.
    The time of the forum had been mostly taken up by Luo Longji's sophistry. With everyone's unanimous agreement, Hu Yuzhi stopped Luo Longji's sophistry and began to let everyone expose him. At this time, Luo Longji turned around and bit back: "Now you don't let me explain, and when everyone talks about it later, you will say that I didn't explain." A burst of contemptuous laughter erupted in the meeting, and no one paid attention to his last quibble.
    Pu Xixiu first spoke at the meeting. She read some letters from Luo Longji to her, most of which were things that had already been discussed at the symposium of journalists.

    民盟整风会上罗隆基无耻狡赖
    费孝通历数罗隆基的阴谋手法
    邵慈云揭露罗隆基的卑劣行为
    本报讯　在7月3日夜民盟中央举行的第三次整风座谈会上，费孝通揭露了罗隆基的右派手法；还宣读了罗隆基的秘书邵慈云揭发罗隆基的各种卑劣行为的信。罗隆基仍然用敌对的态度抵赖他反共反社会主义的阴谋活动。这次座谈会一开始，主持会议的胡愈之宣布责成罗隆基就以下几个问题进行交代：一、如何通过浦熙修控制文汇报；二、和储安平事先商量他的发言稿的问题；三、小集团的情况；四、章罗联盟问题。但是，罗隆基并没有进行什么交代。罗隆基用琐碎的令人疲劳的狡辩来消磨大家的时间。他的交代从七点四十五分开始，九点半被制止，在将近两小时的发言中，他并没有交代出任何事实，甚至连大家已经揭发证实的材料，他也不肯承认。一开始，他说他要交代一个重要问题。他说，在统战部座谈会上他提出了成立平反委员会的主张后，曾收到一百七十封信，其中有一百三十多件是谈平反委员会问题的。当他的秘书请示他这些信如何处理时，他指示秘书，对赞成平反委员会的信，要回信：“请在各方面造成舆论，请向统战部和政协全国委员会建议。”实际上，这并不是罗隆基的交代，这个问题在上次座谈会上，史良就已经揭发了他。今天，他无可奈何地承认了这点事实，但是并没有进一步谈他这样做的企图是什么，还有什么打算等等。
    谈到如何通过浦熙修控制文汇报的问题时，罗隆基扯了许多不关紧要的闲事，而根本否认了徐铸成等已经揭发的通过浦熙修利用文汇报这个严重问题。甚至把某些无法抵赖的重要事实轻描淡写为一两句不妥当的话。当千家驹起来质问他，人民日报社论对文汇报的批评是否事实时，罗隆基竟然狡猾地说，“我不表示意见，说没控制文汇报，你们说我是狡赖；要承认，我又不愿乱给自己带帽子。”关于储安平的“党天下”的谬论问题，储安平在人民代表大会的小组会上已经承认了他这次发言中的问题事先同罗隆基商量过。但是，罗隆基在交代这个问题时，仍然百般狡辩，时而说在谈“老和尚小和尚”问题时，他们的意见不一致，时而说储安平那天并没说要在统战部发言等等。当张曼筠、史良为他的狡辩激怒得不能忍耐，宣布了储安平在人代会小组会的发言，特别是史良指出，现在的问题已不是看不看发言稿的问题，而是储安平同你商量受你影响的问题。以后，罗隆基仍然抵赖到底，说什么事实总是事实，我不辩了。
    对于罗隆基反动宗派活动，大家已经揭发了许多事实。可是罗隆基在交代这个问题时，先讲他事先没有准备，现在想不起来了，不能交代。继而又说他指的是两三年以前的小集团，一口否认这两年的宗派活动。当会场上有人要他就上海新闻日报陆诒所揭露的材料进行交代时，他又狡猾地用一些不关紧要的事情来搪塞大家，或者是解释推托某些事实，或者是说某些问题记不清了。有人提出问题质问，他避而不答，反而反击别人说：就是上海陆诒说了，我也要他拿出证据。”而且一再说什么“如有小集团活动，可以杀我的头”。这时，会场上的人已为罗隆基拒不交代的敌对态度激怒得再也不能忍耐。史良责斥他说“你开口闭口说杀你的头，这是耍流氓态度。”闵刚侯说，你为自己辩护时，讲得那么清楚，要你交代小集团名单，你就说你忘了，现在我替你宣布。闵刚侯立即宣布说：罗隆基的小集团包括：曾昭抡、潘光旦、费孝通、吴景超、范朴斋、张志和、叶笃义、潘大逵，刘王立明，张东荪、周鲸文；罗隆基的据点，在西南的是潘大逵，在太原的是王文光，在浙江的是姜震中，在上海的是彭文应、陈仁炳，在湖南的是杜迈之，在湖北的是马哲民。
    座谈会的时间已经被罗隆基的狡辩占去了大半。胡愈之在大家一致同意的情况下，制止了罗隆基的狡辩，开始让大家揭发。而这时罗隆基竟然反咬一口：“现在你们不让我交代，回头大家讲出来了，又要说我不交代。”会场上发出一片轻蔑的笑声，没有人理睬他的最后的狡赖。
    浦熙修首先在会上发言，她宣读了罗隆基给她的一些信件，这些大多是在新闻工作者座谈会上已经谈过的东西。
