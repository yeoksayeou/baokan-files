    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 21st: The people on both sides of the Yi River and Shu River in Shandong Province have initially overcome the extraordinary flood unseen in a century.

    Since the beginning of July, the Yimeng mountainous area has experienced continuous heavy rain, causing the water levels of the Yi and Shu rivers to rise sharply, with three extraordinary flood peaks appearing consecutively. Among them, the maximum flood peak flow of the Shu River on the 16th reached 3,450 cubic meters per second, exceeding the guaranteed flow by 750 cubic meters per second; the maximum flood peak flow of the Yi River at 23:00 on the 19th reached 15,500 cubic meters per second, exceeding the guaranteed flow by 5,100 cubic meters per second. This is an extraordinary flood unprecedented in the historical records of the two rivers.

    Thanks to the early preparations made by the people along the rivers and the flood control departments at all levels, more than 50,000 cadres, masses, and soldiers immediately and organizedly threw themselves into the flood prevention and rescue struggle after the flood occurred. Mu Lin, a member of the Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, Zhu Qimin, Secretary of the Linyi Prefectural Party Committee, and Li Xiping, Commissioner of the Linyi Prefectural Commissioner's Office, braved the rain to go to the dikes, directing everyone to rush to build a one-meter-high secondary embankment along the river. At the same time, the masses in dangerous areas were evacuated to higher ground. In the midst of the wind and rain, everyone united and overcame many unimaginable difficulties. When most of the telephone lines were blown down by the wind, the cavalry unit of a certain PLA unit immediately took on the task of reporting the flood situation, ensuring the connection between the flood control headquarters and the construction site.

    Although the flood on the east bank of the Yi River from Matou to Liujiangkou overflowed the secondary embankment, and the Shu River also experienced slope collapse and other dangerous situations in Tancheng, most of the dangerous sections were turned from danger to safety under the round-the-clock guard and rescue efforts of cadres, masses, and soldiers. On the morning of the 19th, two breaches occurred in the Yi River within the Tancheng territory, but no serious losses were caused due to timely rescue.

    山东沂河沭河两岸人民
    初步战胜百年罕有的特大洪水
    新华社济南21日电　山东省沂河、沭河两岸人民，初步战胜了百年来罕有的特大洪水。
    7月上旬以来，沂蒙山区连降暴雨，沂、沭两河水位猛涨，连续出现了三次特大洪峰。其中沭河在16日最大一次洪峰流量达三千四百五十秒公方，超过保证流量七百五十秒公方；沂河在19日23时的最大洪峰流量达一万五千五百秒公方，超过保证流量五千一百秒公方。这是两河历史资料上所未有的特大洪水。
    由于沿河人民和各级防汛部门早有准备，汛情发生后，两河沿岸立即有干部、群众和部队五万多人有组织地投入了防汛抢险斗争。中共山东省委常委穆林、中共临沂地委书记朱奇民、临沂专署专员李希平等都冒雨上堤，指挥大家在沿河抢修起一公尺高的子埝。同时，危险地带的群众都转移到高地。在狂风暴雨中，大家团结一致，克服了许多难以想像的困难。当电话线路大部被风刮断时，解放军某部的骑兵部队立即担负起报汛工作，保证了防汛指挥部和工地之间的联系。
    虽然沂河东岸马头至刘江口一段洪水漫过子埝，沭河在郯城也出现塌坡等险象，但是在干部、群众和部队日夜坚守抢护下，做到水涨堤高使大部险工都转危为安。19日晨，沂河在郯城境内决口两处，也因抢救及时而未造成严重损失。
