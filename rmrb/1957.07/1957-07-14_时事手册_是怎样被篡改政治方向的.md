How the "Current Events Handbook" Was Corrupted Politically
By Li Pengyin, Editorial Staff of the Current Events Handbook

After reading Comrade Fen Ruo's article, "Who Controls the Editorial Department of the Current Events Handbook?", as an editor of the Current Events Handbook, I feel deeply ashamed and heartbroken. As Comrade Fen Ruo's article points out, the Current Events Handbook, due to the publication of two so-called comprehensive reports in the tenth and eleventh issues that did not critically examine the "voicing opinions" and "blooming" situations in various regions, and the publication in the eleventh issue of a vicious essay that made slanderous attacks on the Party's rectification policy, seriously lost its proletarian stance for a period and embarked on a bourgeois political direction. Indeed, one cannot help but wonder: who controls the editorial department of the Current Events Handbook?

How did the Current Events Handbook's editorial department completely lose its position in this political struggle? What was the process by which the Current Events Handbook's political direction was once corrupted? Where did the main figures in the editorial department want to lead the Current Events Handbook? I believe I have a responsibility to reveal what I know to the readers regarding all these issues that have already attracted widespread attention.

Major Editors Had Bourgeois Ideologies, Were Dissatisfied with the Party, and Colluded with Rightists

First, let's talk about how things happened:

Under the frenzied attacks of rightists against the Party, socialism, and the people's democratic dictatorship, several main editors of the Current Events Handbook's editorial department, including the person in charge, Deputy Director of the Editorial Office Yu Gan, editors Liu Chenggong, Liang Ming, Wang Zhimin, and Deng Shusheng, because their bourgeois worldviews and bourgeois journalistic viewpoints had not been seriously criticized and reformed, almost from the beginning praised and resonated with the absurd arguments of the bourgeois rightists attacking the Communist Party's leadership and socialism. In particular, the attacks by Gu Zhizhong and others on socialist journalism received an even greater response from them. Lan Yu, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House and a Communist Party member who was directly in charge of the Current Events Handbook starting from the eleventh issue, also responded enthusiastically. They began to negate everything the Current Events Handbook had done in the past, believing that everything published in the past was dogmatic, repeatedly saying that the Current Events Handbook, which in the past had a clear proletarian stance, had a "hateful face." They began to curse the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China's guidance to the editorial department as a "dogmatic set of things." Someone openly raised the question: "Is the Current Events Handbook an official publication or a folk publication?" as if being an "official publication" was very disgraceful. Someone suggested that the Current Events Handbook should also "greatly voice opinions and bloom." Since these comrades praised and echoed the rightists' anti-communist fallacies, they considered the rightists' attacks on socialism to be the so-called "pulse of society," believing that the Current Events Handbook "should not stand outside this struggle." Under the domination of this kind of thinking, they put forward a plan to "innovate" the layout of the Current Events Handbook. The main content of this plan was to continuously comprehensively report on the situation of "greatly voicing opinions and blooming," to set up a column for short essays called "Three Words and Two Phrases," and to engage in some "soft" things in the publication, and so on. Obviously, this approach was fundamentally incompatible with the Current Events Handbook's inherent proletarian stance and the task of socialist mass education. But unfortunately, during this period, this bourgeois journalistic viewpoint prevailed in the editorial department and received the support of Lan Yu. Any opposition to this approach, or opinions that expressed doubt about this approach, were rejected, attacked, and suppressed. I remember when drafting the reporting plan for the eleventh issue, they wanted to follow up the article "Shanghai in the Midst of Great Voicing Opinions and Blooming" with another comprehensive "great synthesis." At this time, I raised the opposite opinion. I said, "If we comprehensively report without criticism, some of the erroneous arguments will affect the readers." But Yu Gan and Wang Zhimin said, "Our responsibility is not to criticize, but simply to objectively present these arguments to the readers." They also said, "One of our tasks is to collect newspaper articles." Deng Shusheng also excitedly said, "Are we breathing with the same pulse as society, or are we standing outside this struggle?" As a result, my opinion was not supported. I also pointed out two points, namely, that even if 90 percent of the "voicing opinions" and "blooming" opinions are positive, there is still a small part that is wrong, and we should pay attention to it; and that I heard that the grassroots level is not yet carrying out rectification, and we should not present the erroneous opinions in the "voicing opinions" and "blooming" to them. But these opinions were also rejected. So, Yu Gan and the other six people, in the name of the "Journal's Reference Room," divided the work and jointly wrote the article "Spring Breeze Turns into Rain, Great Voicing Opinions and Blooming." When looking at the proof of this article, although I felt that the article tasted wrong, I did not fundamentally negate it. I only made a few suggestions at a few very blatant places. Yu Gan adopted my suggestions and made slight revisions, diluting the anti-Party and anti-socialist atmosphere of the article somewhat. I also raised objections to the essay "Stewed Pork Knuckle with Gentle Heat" published in the eleventh issue. However, Yu Gan did not adopt them.

More importantly, in the editing process of the eleventh issue, when Chairman Mao's instructions on the rectification movement – his speech to the representatives of the Communist Youth League – had already been published in the newspaper, I suggested to Yu Gan that we invite someone to write a short article to elaborate on the idea that "all statements and actions that deviate from socialism are wrong," but Yu Gan refused, believing that doing so would hinder "voicing opinions and blooming." When looking at the proofs, although the event of Chairman Mao's meeting with the representatives of the Communist Youth League was listed in the news brief on the last page, not a single word was mentioned about the content of Chairman Mao's speech. I pointed this out to Yu Gan, and he then allowed me to add it. This kind of handling was of course very wrong. The question here is, why was Yu Gan so interested in the absurd words of the rightists, but treated Chairman Mao's instruction as a mere breeze?

Regarding how the main editors of the Current Events Handbook's editorial department echoed the rightists' reactionary statements, one can also mention the reaction caused by Chu Anping's June 1 speech on the so-called "Party's World" to them. At that time, Yu Gan and several others unanimously expressed their appreciation for this fallacy, believing that it "made a lot of sense," that "the attitude was well-intentioned," and that it "provided a good example of criticizing the Party, because it also raised opinions about Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou." Conversely, regarding Mr. He Xiangning's written statement published in the newspaper on the same day, they merely said that "He Xiangning also criticized the Party members of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission." I reminded them at the time that He Xiangning warned the rightists not to be rightists for life. But they were not interested in this point at all. Even after the Party newspaper launched a counterattack against the rightist statements, some people still believed that the criticisms of the newspapers and the workers and peasants "were not enough to convince Chu Anping," that "what Chu Anping said was the truth," and that "Chu Anping and Ge Peiqi should be treated separately." From these facts, I find it difficult to distinguish what the difference is between several editors of the Current Events Handbook's editorial department and the rightists.

After the People's Daily criticized the bourgeois political direction of Wenhui Daily and Guangming Daily, I suggested to Yu Gan that we should conduct a review of the political direction and class stand of the editorial department during this period. I also criticized the editorial department's right-leaning thoughts and the errors in the tenth and eleventh issues at the plenary editorial department's rectification meeting on June 21. But my criticism and suggestions were met with Yu Gan's dictatorial accusations. He said: What position are you standing in to make such criticisms? You seem to be an "imperial envoy."

Obviously, for the errors made by the Current Events Handbook in terms of political stance in the tenth and eleventh issues, every editor of the Current Events Handbook (including myself) has an inescapable responsibility. The Deputy Editor-in-Chief Lan Yu, who finally reviewed the manuscripts, should also bear political responsibility, while Yu Gan, the Deputy Director of the Editorial Department, should bear the main responsibility.

During this period, Yu Gan and several other editors acted as echoers of the bourgeois reactionary rightists. This was by no means accidental. The reason why Yu Gan made such a serious mistake was because he had long held bourgeois ideas, had a resistant attitude towards ideological transformation, and harbored deep dissatisfaction with the Party's leadership. It was precisely this dissatisfaction with the Party's leadership that made him quickly meet with the rightists' attacks on the Party, causing him to leave the position of a Communist Party member and stand in a position antagonistic to the Party. Others such as Communist Party member and editor Liang Ming, and Party group leader, branch committee member, and editor Liu Chenggong, Communist Youth League member and editor Deng Shusheng, also had similar situations.

They Resisted the Party's Leadership and Demanded "Independent" Action

It should be pointed out that they not only acted as echoers of the rightists in words, but also opposed the Party's leadership in action and strived for the "independence" of the Current Events Handbook.

The Current Events Handbook was originally founded by the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China in October 1950. Half a year later, it was handed over to the leadership of the Xinhua News Agency. In January 1954, the Central Propaganda Department, considering that this was a popular journal, decided to transfer it to the leadership of the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House. At the same time, the Central Propaganda Department has always paid attention to providing guidance in terms of propaganda policies. But Yu Gan and others have always been deeply dissatisfied with this decision, regarding this decision as a "forced marriage," calling the Current Events Handbook "living under someone else's roof." Yu Gan had long planned to make the "Current Events Handbook" independent. In 1955 and 1956, several people headed by Yu Gan repeatedly submitted reports to the Central Propaganda Department, requesting a change to this decision. The Central Propaganda Department, considering this to be an act lacking organizational and disciplinary concepts, instructed the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House's Party organization to educate the Party members and non-Party cadres of the Current Events Handbook. The Popular Reading Materials Publishing House once conducted an ideological criticism in the editorial department of the Current Events Handbook. But Yu Gan did not accept it, and even believed that this was the Popular Publishing House trying to "subdue" them.

From then on, Yu Gan, Liang Ming, and others superficially obeyed the organization's decision, but in reality, they resisted the leadership of the Popular Publishing House in various ways. The most obvious example was the open exclusion of Comrade Mao Qin, a Communist Party member who had originally worked in the Central Propaganda Department and was transferred to the Current Events Handbook by the Popular Publishing House, saying that Mao Qin was a "typical example of sectarianism and dogmatism harming," and was sent by the superior to "supervise" them, and they discriminated against and attacked her in all aspects.

As soon as the rectification began, the rightists in the press and publishing circles released statements about running so-called "cooperative news agencies," "cooperative newspapers," and "cooperative magazines," attempting to seize leadership over the press and publishing industry, while Lan Yu, the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House, also proposed a theory of re-"reorganizing" the publishing industry led by the Party. These arguments completely catered to the tastes of Yu Gan and others. They believed that the opportunity to break away from the Party's leadership and strive for the "independence" of the Current Events Handbook had arrived.

After the start of the rectification, the first and repeatedly raised question by most people in the Current Events Handbook's editorial department headed by Yu Gan was the so-called "independence" issue, the so-called "where to go" issue, and some also called it the "affiliation" issue and the "way out" issue. They raised the so-called independent demands of the Current Events Handbook under the pretext of opposing the bureaucracy and sectarianism of the superior. Yu Gan openly stated that the Current Events Handbook should "get rid of" the "incompetent" leadership of the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House, should have an "independently acting editorial department," should have an "independently responsible environment," and an "affiliation," but he also said that this "affiliation" was not a relationship of "intervening in everything from personnel to editing," nor was it the kind of "reviewing manuscripts" relationship that "Popular" has with us now. He said that the editorial department should be "independently active and independently responsible." Someone else plainly said that there should be an "affiliation" because there needs to be a place to manage salaries and housing! Yu Gan himself also said bluntly, "What 'affiliation' or 'no affiliation,' it's enough to have a place for the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League to manage and have a place to have organizational life." Although Yu Gan said that "getting rid of" the leadership of the Popular Publishing House does not necessarily mean that he will "deviate from the Party's leadership" or "deviate from socialism," this approach and thinking clearly resists the Party's leadership and rejects the Party's leadership. This is echoing the activities of the bourgeois rightists opposing the Communist Party's leadership.

They Drafted an Anti-Party "Appeal," Attempting to Oppose the Party with "Social Pressure"

In order to achieve the goal of the Current Events Handbook's editorial department's "independence," the editorial department headed by Yu Gan also decided to "appeal to public opinion and strive for social sympathy" to help solve this problem with social "pressure." This decision was passed at the Current Events Handbook editorial office's rectification forum on June 6. At that time, Liang Ming was elected to draft an "appeal," and Yu Gan volunteered to "help." This "appeal" was prepared to be sent to the People's Daily for publication. If the People's Daily did not publish it, it would be sent to Guangming Daily and Wenhui Daily. If it still wasn't published, it would be published in the Current Events Handbook, taking up three or four pages. This plan had already received the support of Lan Yu in advance. It was only because the counterattack against the bourgeois rightists began soon after that this so-called "appeal" did not have time to be completed and sent out.

This "appeal" is a thoroughly anti-Party thing. It begins by saying: "Dear readers, you will never know the experiences of the Current Events Handbook's editorial department, how much loss the 'three evils' have caused it." The appeal said: "In order to save the fate of the publication, we cannot but appeal to society, asking the broad masses of readers to give us support and strength." The "appeal" described the superior's decision to change the leadership relationship as "kicking the Current Events Handbook around like a football." The appeal said that "the Popular Publishing House has all 'three evils' towards the Current Events Handbook," saying that "there is not a shred of goodwill" towards "the Ministry of Culture and the Publishing House, these two superiors who are high above." The "appeal" even attempted to agitate readers by taking the fact that newsprint was in short supply and the Publication Bureau once decided to limit the distribution of the Current Events Handbook and other publications. Yu Gan and Liang Ming are both Communist Party members. Who would believe that this so-called "appeal" came from the hands of two Communist Party members after reading it? Who can believe that these Communist Party members would actually use the pressure of the bourgeois rightists' attacks on the Party (the so-called social pressure) to achieve their anti-Party conspiracy?

In order to achieve the so-called "independence," Party members Yu Gan, Liu Chenggong, and Liang Ming, at the editorial department's rectification meeting, launched a large-scale attack on the superior leading organs, launching personal attacks and curses on the leaders, and consciously carried out incitement and provocation among non-Party comrades. Yu Gan, as the chairman of the Current Events Handbook's rectification forum, first pointed out that the Current Events Handbook's experience was a so-called "typical three evils," and that a certain non-Party comrade was a "typical victim of the 'three evils'." He also called on people who had grievances in the suppression of counterrevolutionaries or other aspects to "sue for injustice and complain of suffering," calling on these comrades to "pour out bitterness" and "protect themselves," and also said that certain two non-Party comrades "were sent here because no one wanted them." Yu Gan was very dissatisfied with the superior's instructions on the Party members' need to abide by Party discipline during the rectification, saying that "this is equivalent to asking me to 'voice opinions' and 'bloom' again, but also to put a seal on my mouth." Party group leader and branch committee member Liu Chenggong said that he "brought a rebellious character from the old society," and he quoted Gorky's famous saying about resisting the Tsarist rule, saying that "people come into the world to resist." He said that before joining the Party, he had suffered from the "harm" of "sectarianism." After joining the Party, he added the harm of this sectarianism to others. Liu Chenggong, just like the bourgeois rightists, vigorously attacked our Party and government's cadre policies and personnel system, and vigorously attacked the Party's discipline. He said that the Party had sectarianism in the past, but now that the class struggle has basically ended, the standards of morality, talent, and qualifications that the Party had made for cadres in the past are "no longer applicable." The conclusions and assessments made by the Party for cadres in the past were all "inappropriate" and should be "disclosed" and "re-evaluated" to show the Party's "equal treatment" of intellectuals. He also said that now our country is supporting a group of "incompetent" and "unqualified" old cadres who should "give up" their jobs and create conditions for society to "freely choose occupations." If there is any truth to these words, it is that the Party organization, in the past period, did not recognize the true faces of these so-called Communist Party members who were hanging the title of Communist Party member, and treated them as Communist Party members.

Since the start of the struggle against the rightists, the above-mentioned anti-Party activities of Yu Gan, Liu Chenggong, Liang Ming, and others have been forced to stop, but for a period of time, they have expressed resistance and doubt about the Party and the people's masses' struggle against the rightists. Liu Chenggong even said: The reason for refuting the rightists now is probably that some senior cadres in the Party do not understand the ideological direction of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Liang Ming also doubted whether the People's Daily's criticism of Wenhui Daily was "excessive," and wondered whether it was right for the Minjian and others to launch a liquidation of Zhang Naqi's thinking and turn the spearhead of the rectification to the rightists.

Based on the above situation, it can be seen that the Current Events Handbook's editorial department was manipulated by Yu Gan and other anti-Party people with rightist ideas who betrayed their class standing for a period of time. We must thoroughly expose and criticize their erroneous ideas and bring the Current Events Handbook back to the right path.

    “时事手册”是怎样被篡改政治方向的
    时事手册编辑  李蓬茵
    读了奋若同志的“时事手册编辑部操纵在谁手里？”一文以后，我作为时事手册的一个编辑人员，感到十分羞愧，十分痛心。正如奋若同志的文章所指出的，时事手册由于在第十期和第十一期刊登了两篇对各地“鸣”“放”情况的毫无批判的所谓综合报道，又在第十一期刊登了对党的整风方针作诬蔑性攻击的恶毒的小品文，其所产生的后果，使时事手册在一个时期内严重地丧失了无产阶级的立场，走上了资产阶级的政治方向。的确，不能不使人怀疑：时事手册编辑部操纵在谁手里？
    时事手册编辑部为什么会在这次政治斗争中完全丧失立场呢？时事手册政治方向之所以一度被篡改的过程是怎样的呢？编辑部的主要人物想把时事手册引导到那里去呢？所有这些已经引起广大读者注意的问题，我认为我有责任尽我所知，向读者揭发。
    主要编辑人员有资产阶级思想，对党不满，与右派分子一拍即合
    首先谈谈事情发生的过程：
    在右派分子反党、反社会主义和反人民民主专政的猖狂进攻下，时事手册编辑部的几个主要编辑人员，包括负责人，编辑室副主任于干、编辑刘沉弓、梁明、王志民和邓蜀生等，由于他们的资产阶级的世界观和资产阶级的新闻观点都没有得到认真的批判和改造，因此对于资产阶级右派分子攻击共产党的领导和社会主义的一些荒谬言论，几乎一开始就加以赞扬和共鸣。特别是顾执中等人对社会主义新闻事业的进攻，更得到了他们的响应。从十一期起负责直接领导时事手册工作的通俗读物出版社副总编辑、共产党员蓝钰也热烈响应。他们开始否定时事手册过去的一切，认为过去登载的东西都是教条主义的，一再说过去的具有鲜明的无产阶级立场的时事手册“面目可憎”。他们开始咒骂中共中央宣传部对编辑部的指导是“教条主义的一套”。有人公开提出：“时事手册究竟是官方刊物还是民间刊物”的问题，似乎作为“官方刊物”是很不光彩的了。有人提出时事手册也应当“大放大鸣”。这些同志既然赞扬和附和右派的反共谬论，于是就认为右派对社会主义的进攻是所谓“社会的脉搏”，认为时事手册“不应当站在这个斗争之外”。就在这种思想的支配之下，他们提出了“革新”时事手册的版面的计划。这个计划的主要内容，就是要不断地把“大鸣”“大放”的情况加以综合报道，设立“三言两语”的小品文专栏，以及在刊物上搞一些“软性”的东西等等。很显然，这种做法，是同时事手册所固有的无产阶级立场和社会主义的群众教育的任务，根本不符合的。但是不幸，在这一个时期，这种资产阶级的新闻观点在编辑部竟然占了上风，并且得到了蓝钰的支持。凡是反对这样做，或者是对这种做法表示怀疑的意见，都受到拒绝、打击和压制。记得在拟订第十一期报道计划的时候，他们要继“上海在大放大鸣中”一文之后，再来一篇全面的“大综合”，这时，我是提过相反的意见的。我说：“如果不加批判地综合报道，其中一些错误言论就会影响读者。”但于干和王志明说：“我们的责任不在批判，只是把这些言论客观地端给读者就行了”。他们还说：“我们的任务之一，就是作报纸的集纳”。邓蜀生也激动地说：“我们是与社会同脉搏共呼吸呢？还是站在这个斗争之外呢”？结果我的意见没有得到支持。我又指出两点，即“鸣”“放”的意见纵然百分之九十是积极的，但也有一小部分是错误的，我们应当注意；听说基层现在还不搞整风，我们不应当把“鸣”“放”中的错误意见往下面端，但是这些意见也受到排斥。于是以于干为首的六人就以“本刊资料室”名义分工合作写出了“春风化雨、大放大鸣”一文。在看这篇文章的清样时，我虽觉得这篇文章味道不对，但是我却没有从根本上去否定它，我只在几处十分露骨的地方提了几点意见，于干采纳了我的意见略加修改，把这篇文章的反党反社会主义的气氛稍为冲淡了一些。我对于第十一期上所载的“文火炖猪蹄”的小品文，也是提过意见的。但是，于干并没有采纳。
    更重要的是，在第十一期的编辑过程中，当时毛主席的关于整风运动的指示——对共青团代表们的讲话已在报上发表，我就向于干提议请人写一篇短文阐述一下“一切离开社会主义的言论和行动都是错误的”的思想，但是于干加以拒绝，认为这样做就会妨碍“鸣”“放”。在看清样时，毛主席接见共青团代表这件事虽被列入最后一页的要闻简报中，但毛主席的讲话内容却一个字也没有提到。我向于干提出，他才让我添了上去。这样处理当然是非常错误的。这里的问题是，于干为什么对右派分子的一派胡言那么感到兴趣，而对毛主席的这个指示却当做耳边风呢？
    关于时事手册编辑部的几个主要的编辑人员是怎样附和右派的反动言论，还可以提到储安平六月一日关于所谓“党天下”的发言对他们所引起的反应。当时于干和其他几人，对于这个谬论一致表示欣赏，认为“说得很有道理”，“态度是善意的”，是“提供了批评党的一个好榜样，因为对毛主席和周总理也提了意见”。相反地，对于报纸上同一天登出的何香凝先生的书面发言，他们却仅仅是说“何香凝也批评了侨委的党员。”我当时曾提醒说，何香凝警告右派分子，不要一辈子作右派。但是他们对这一点却丝毫不感到兴趣。甚至在党报对右派言论开展反击以后，还有人认为报纸和工农群众的批评“不足以说服储安平”，“储安平所说的是事实”，认为“对储安平和葛佩琦应该分别对待才对”。从这些事实中，我很难分辨时事手册编辑部的几个编辑与右派分子究竟有什么区别。
    在人民日报对于文汇报和光明日报的资产阶级的政治方向进行批评以后，我曾向于干提出建议，要求对编辑部这一个时期的政治方向和阶级立场作一次检查，我并且在六月二十一日召开的全编辑部的整风会上对编辑部的右倾思想和第十、第十一两期刊物上的错误作了批评。但是我的批评和建议遭到了于干的专横的指责，他说：你是站在什么地位来作这样的批评的？你似乎是一个“钦差大臣”。
    显然，对于时事手册第十期和第十一期在政治立场上所犯的错误，时事手册的每一个编辑（包括我自己在内）都是有不可逃避的责任的，最后审阅稿子的副总编辑蓝钰也应当担负政治的责任，而编辑部副主任于干更要担负主要的责任。
    这一个时期，于干和其他几位编辑充当了资产阶级反动右派分子的应声虫，这决不是偶然的。于干之所以发生这样严重的错误，是因为他长久以来存在资产阶级思想，对思想改造有对抗情绪，对党的领导，深怀不满。正是这种对党的领导的不满情绪，使他迅速地与右派分子对党的进攻迎合一起，使他离开了共产党员的立场，站到与党相对抗的地位。其他如共产党员、编辑梁明和党小组长、支部委员、编辑刘沉弓，共青团员、编辑邓蜀生也有类似的情况。
    他们抵制党的领导，要求“独立”行事
    应当指出，他们不仅在言论上作了右派分子的应声虫，并且在行动上还反对党的领导，争取时事手册的“独立”。
    时事手册这个刊物原来是中共中央宣传部在1950年10月创办的。半年后交由新华社领导。1954年1月，党中央宣传部鉴于这是一个通俗期刊，决定把它改属通俗读物出版社领导。同时，中央宣传部在宣传方针上一直注意加以指导。但于干等对于这个决定一直深怀不满，把这个决定看成是“强迫婚姻”，叫时事手册“寄人篱下”。于干早就打算要使“时事手册”独立。1955年和1956年，以于干为首的几个人曾一再上书中宣部，请求改变这个决定。中宣部鉴于这是一种缺乏组织观念和纪律观念的行为，曾经责成通俗读物出版社党组织对时事手册的党员和非党干部进行教育。通俗读物出版社曾经在时事手册编辑部进行了一次思想批判。但是于干没有接受，竟认为这是通俗出版社想“压服”他们。
    从这以后，于干、梁明等在表面上服从了组织的决定，实际上是从各方面抵制通俗出版社的领导。最明显的例子是公然排挤由通俗出版社调到时事手册的原在中宣部工作过的共产党员毛勤同志，说毛勤是“宗派主义、教条主义危害的典型”，是上级派去“监督”他们的，就在各方面对她实行歧视和攻击。
    这次整风刚一开始，新闻出版界的右派分子就放出了办所谓“同人通讯社”、“同人报纸”和“同人杂志”的言论，企图夺取对新闻出版事业的领导权，而通俗读物出版社副总编辑蓝钰也提出了重新“改组”党所领导的出版事业的论调。这些论调完全投合了于干等人的口味。他们认为摆脱党的领导，争取时事手册的“独立”的时机已经到来了。
    整风开始以后，以于干为首的时事手册编辑部的大多数人首先和一再提出的问题就是所谓“独立”问题、所谓“何去何从”问题，也有人说成“归口”问题和“出路”问题。他们是在反对上级的官僚主义和宗派主义的借口下，提出所谓时事手册的独立要求的。于干公开声言时事手册要“摆脱”通俗读物出版社的“不称职”的领导，要有一个“独立行事的编辑部”，要有一个“独立负责的环境”，一个“归口”，不过他又说，这个“归口”并不是“从人事到编辑什么都来过问”的关系，也不是现在“通俗”对我们的这种“审稿”关系。他说编辑部应当是“独立活动、独立负责的”。有人则明明白白地说，要有个“归口”，因为要领薪水、要住房子，这些事总得有个地方管嘛！于干自己也曾直截了当地说过“什么‘归口’不‘归口’，党政工团有个地方管，有个地方过组织生活也就行了。”于干嘴里虽说“摆脱”通俗出版社的领导，不见得就会“游离于党的领导之外”，就会“游离于社会主义之外”，但是这种作法和想法，却明明是抵制党的领导，不要党的领导。这是和资产阶级右派分子反对共产党的领导的活动互相呼应的。
    他们草拟反党的“申诉书”，企图以“社会压力”反对党
    为了达到时事手册编辑部“独立”的目的，以于干为首的编辑部还曾决定把时事手册的问题“诉诸舆论，争取社会同情”，以社会“压力”来帮助解决这个问题。这个决定是在六月六日时事手册编辑室整风座谈会上通过的，当时并推举了由梁明执笔，草拟一个“申诉书”，于干自愿“帮助”。这个“申诉书”是准备送人民日报刊载的，如果人民日报不登就送光明日报、文汇报。如果仍不登就在时事手册拿三、四页篇幅来登。这个计划事先就得到了蓝钰的支持。只是因为不久以后就开始了对于资产阶级右派的反击，这个所谓“申诉书”才没有来得及完稿和送出。
    这个“申诉书”是一个彻头彻尾的反党的东西。它一开头就说：“亲爱的读者，你们绝不会知道时事手册编辑部的遭遇，‘三害’给它造成了多大损失”。申诉书说：“为了挽救刊物的命运，我们不能不诉诸社会，要求广大读者给我们以支持和力量”。“申诉书”把上级改变领导关系的决定，说成是把时事手册“当作皮球一样踢来踢去”。申诉书说“通俗出版社对时事手册是‘三害’俱全”，说“对于文化部和出版社这两个高高在上的上司”，“没有一点好感”。“申诉书”甚至企图拿新闻纸供不应求，出版局一度决定限制时事手册及其他刊物发行数量这件事，来对读者进行煽动。于干和梁明都是共产党员，人们看了这个所谓“申诉书”，谁会相信这是出于两个共产党员的手笔呢？谁又能相信，这些共产党员竟会借资产阶级右派对党进攻的压力（即所谓社会压力）来达到反党的阴谋目的呢？
    为了达到所谓“独立”的目的，党员于干、刘沉弓、梁明三人，在编辑部的整风会上，曾对上级领导机关大肆攻击，对于领导人进行了人身攻击和咒骂，在非党同志中有意识地进行煽动和挑拨。作为时事手册整风座谈会主持人的于干首先指出时事手册的遭遇是所谓“典型的三害”，某某非党同志又是“典型的‘三害’的受害者”。他并号召在肃反或其他方面对党有不满情绪的人“有冤诉冤，有苦诉苦”，号召这些同志“吐苦水”，“自己保护自己”，又说某某两个非党同志，“是因为没有人要”才送到我们这里来的。于干对于上级所作关于整风中党员要遵守党的纪律的指示非常不满，说“这等于又要我‘鸣’‘放’又要我嘴上贴上封条。”党小组长、支委刘沉弓说，他“从旧社会带来了一个叛逆的性格”，他并引用高尔基反抗沙皇统治的名言，说“人到世界上就是来反抗的”。他说他在入党之前，曾经受过“宗派主义”之“害”，入党后，自己又把这种宗派主义之“害”反加于别人。刘沉弓和资产阶级右派分子一模一样地大肆攻击我们党和政府的干部政策和人事制度，大肆攻击党的纪律。他说党过去有宗派主义，现在阶级斗争基本结束了，党过去对干部所作的德、才、资的标准“不适用”了。党过去对干部所作的结论和鉴定等等都“不合适”了，应该把这些档案“公开”，“重新估价”，以示党对知识分子的“一视同仁”。他还说，现在我们的国家养着一批“没有能力”的“不称职”的老干部，这些人应该把工作岗位“让出来”，给社会创造“自由选择职业”的条件。假如他们这些话还有一定道理的话，那就是党组织在过去一个时期内，还不认识这样一些挂着共产党员称号的所谓共产党员的真面目，对他们还当做共产党员看待。
    自反右派的斗争开始以后，上述于干、刘沉弓、梁明等的反党活动虽然被迫停止了，但是在一个时期内，他们对党和人民群众所进行的反右派的斗争，是表示抗拒和怀疑的。刘沉弓竟然说：现在驳斥右派，大概还是党内某些高级干部对“百花齐放百家争鸣”的方针思想不通的原故。梁明也怀疑人民日报对文汇报的批评是不是“过火”了，认为民建等发起清算章乃器的思想，把整风矛头转向右派分子是不是对的。
    根据以上的情况，可以看出时事手册编辑部，在一个时期内是为于干等叛变阶级立场的反党的具有右派思想的人所操纵了。我们必须彻底地揭露和批判他们的错误思想，把时事手册引回正道上来。
