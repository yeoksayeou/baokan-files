Begging for Forgiveness from the People
Huang Qixiang's Speech

Please allow me to speak here with a very heavy heart.

My position in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party is Vice Chairman and Secretary-General. I had organizational and working relationships with Zhang Bojun, and I became Zhang Bojun's captive in thought and action. I am willing to thoroughly confess and criticize this.

The Zhang-Luo alliance, with the Democratic League as its activity center, received my support within the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. During the rectification campaign, I participated in the so-called symposiums organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, starting fires everywhere and causing significant damage to the prestige of the Communist Party. After Zhang Bojun's anti-Communist and anti-socialist crimes were exposed, and he wanted to make a false self-criticism, I blindly helped him. The mistakes I made on the Zhang Bojun issue are serious and undeniable.

I have known Zhang Bojun for many years, and we have worked together for eight years since liberation. Anyone with a bit of political acumen would have noticed Zhang Bojun's political ambition and careerist face long ago. For eight years, especially in the last two years, Zhang Bojun's anti-Communist and anti-socialist thoughts and remarks have emerged, along with many conspiracies, yet I felt nothing. This is a completely irresponsible attitude towards the people's cause, and I cannot shirk responsibility.

After Zhang Bojun's crimes were exposed, I hesitated and watched, which shows that deep in my mind, I had many things in common with Zhang Bojun. I often boasted of my red heart and loyalty to the Communist Party and socialism, but when it came to reality, everything became an illusion: I was unmoved when people cursed the Communist Party; I was unmoved when people said that socialism lacked democracy; I tacitly agreed when people said the Soviet Union was bad; I secretly sympathized when people said capitalism was good. All this shows that I have no real feelings for the Communist Party and no real love for socialism. I could not stand the test of facts.

After Zhang Bojun's crimes were exposed to the people of the whole country and received severe condemnation, for a considerable period of time, I always thought it was only a matter of thought. Everyone criticized, and I also criticized, but in reality, I was unwilling to treat this ideological class struggle, which is related to the life and death of the country, with a serious attitude. Not only that, because my position was unstable and my understanding was vague, I had no true love for the people and no true hatred for the enemy, so I wanted to help Zhang Bojun get away with it, thinking that this was helping a "friend." Therefore, whether it was exposing or criticizing, it was fundamentally weak and intolerable. Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, I was in charge of the work of the leading inspection group for Zhang Bojun's crimes in the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, which was obviously inappropriate, and the working methods could not but be wrong. Therefore, I have been criticized and suspected by the masses, which is completely right. I hereby express my acceptance of the beneficial lessons the masses have given me.

Where did Zhang Bojun's anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and actions come from? He was originally just a rogue street politician. After liberation, the people treated him well. Why was he still not satisfied and wanted to indulge in fantasy and even be hostile to the people? This shows that the toxicity and danger of the bourgeoisie's pursuit of maximum profit are unimaginable. The saying "After becoming emperor, one wants to be an immortal" and the current imperialists' threat of atomic war to maintain the exploitation system are all developed from this kind of reactionary thinking. Speaking of myself, why did I follow Zhang Bojun? I think the main reason is that my ideological direction is the same as his, and I was learning from him. If our thoughts are the same, our actions can be used by each other, so it is not surprising that I naturally supported Zhang Bojun.

I played a consultative role in Zhang Bojun's "self-criticism" published in the newspaper on June 14. On the night of the 13th, he took me to his house, saying that someone had told him that the situation was tense and that he should quickly make a self-criticism to avoid affecting the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and he wanted me to help him. At that time, I knew that he had not come to terms with his thoughts and could not make a self-criticism, but I also thought that it was good for him to admit his mistakes, and it was also good for the "fortress" to surrender (as Zhang Bojun himself said), so I did not refuse to help him. Until recently, I still thought that I had not done anything wrong. After my comrades pointed it out, I finally realized that this was a serious mistake. I was not only helping Zhang Bojun revise his false self-criticism and false surrender; ideologically, I was equal to making a false self-criticism and false surrender for myself, trying to muddle through. This is a concrete manifestation of a dishonest attitude and an irresponsible attitude towards the people's cause.

I am a soldier from a feudal landlord family who has lived in the old society for a long time. I have stains in my history, and later I was contaminated with a lot of toxins from the social life of the European and American bourgeoisie. In my youth, there is no doubt that my thinking was feudal; after the Great Revolution, for twenty years, it was mixed with some bourgeois ideas. After liberation, I received the education of the Communist Party, but my progress was very slow, and I missed the old more than I accepted the new. Bourgeois ideas and feudal remnants were deeply hidden in my soul. As for the Marxist-Leninist ideological stance, viewpoints, and methods, I simply could not grasp and use them. In this anti-rightist struggle, I was exposed:

1. Zhang Bojun and I often came into contact and often heard his reactionary remarks, but I didn't care. This not only shows that I completely lost my vigilance against him, but also shows that his ideological toxins have invaded my mind without resistance.
2. I found Zhang Bojun's absurd remarks, but I neither argued with him nor reflected them in time, which shows that I objectively shielded him and had serious political responsibility.
3. I studied Chairman Mao's policy of "unity, criticism, unity," but I did not seek thorough understanding, but only one-sidedly emphasized unity, abandoned principles, dared not criticize, and dared not struggle, and accommodated Zhang Bojun in everything, which led to serious mistakes. The root of my thinking is that I am willing to muddle along with Zhang Bojun and make personal plans, and I have not put the people's cause in my eyes.
4. When Zhang Bojun came to pick me up on the night of June 13 to help him make a false self-criticism, it was clear that an enemy was standing in front of me, but I still couldn't see him clearly and was willing to be used by him. This shows that my sentimentalism and individualism have firmly occupied the dominant position, so that I lost the people's position and covered up for Zhang Bojun to muddle through. Objectively, it is an alliance of attack and defense.
5. In terms of working methods, I have always made the mistakes of being subjective, impatient, and divorced from the masses. This is inseparable from my bourgeois individualism and arrogant style. After the seriousness of the Zhang Bojun issue was revealed and my procrastinating and weak leadership methods and the fact that the exposure was not thorough were suspected by the masses, I was very distressed. But I was self-righteous, did not humbly ask people for advice, and did not earnestly express my determination to struggle to the leadership and ask for specific help. This is a very big mistake. Just then, Han Zhao'e, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and the Democratic League, and Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province, was actually active in the Qianmen Hotel, saying that someone wanted to beat Zhang Bojun to death with one stick, expressing "injustice," and privately proposed a list of members of the inspection team, asking people for consent, trying to help Zhang Bojun get away with it. Han Zhao'e's friendship with Zhang Bojun was not good. Why did he work so hard this time to take the non-organizational route to help Zhang Bojun? It is not enough to say that he is sentimental. In fact, there is an unspeakable secret. Since Han Zhao'e is determined to take off his pants, he should thoroughly explain the content of this matter from beginning to end. As for the lessons I personally learned on this issue, I knew about Han Zhao'e's conspiracy, but I only took a contemptuous attitude and did not stop it. Instead, I lost my composure and criticized him on purpose, and my own thinking was also confused. Therefore, it aggravated the seriousness of the mistakes in the working leadership method.

Representatives, after deep reflection, I think my mistakes are serious and my responsibility is inescapable. I was a captive of Zhang Bojun, I participated in Zhang Bojun's criminal activities, and the bourgeois ideological essence seriously exists deep in my mind, and there are still many feudal remnants. Therefore, my actions are characterized by the inability to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, opportunism, irresponsibility for the people's work, and sentimentality towards people, even to the point of willingly being a captive. The result of the development of this kind of thinking is that I will embark on the anti-Party and anti-socialist road without realizing it.

Zhang Bojun's crimes have been exposed, and the people of the whole country are continuing to expose and criticize Zhang Bojun's crimes, and continue to wage a resolute struggle against Zhang Bojun and all right-wing elements. I, who have made serious mistakes, am willing to express honestly to the representatives: I admit my mistakes, be vigilant, and guarantee that I will not make mistakes in the future; and I swear to draw a line between Zhang Bojun and myself thoroughly in politics and thought, stand on the people's position, and resolutely fight Zhang Bojun's line to the end. Up to now, I have felt that the anti-rightist class struggle is the first great pain in my life, and at the same time, it is the beginning of a happy era. Without this struggle, I would not be able to get rid of the old ideological consciousness, and I would not be able to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and distinguish right from wrong. Without this struggle, I would inevitably fall into the mud ditch and become the residue in the torrent of the times, and cut myself off from the people. In the future, I can only strengthen learning and transformation in order to strive for continuous progress.

Since the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, for twenty years, I fled, I surrendered to Chiang, I opposed Chiang, and my actions in the Anti-Japanese War showed wavering, but my thoughts never left the Communist Party for a moment. Even in the most difficult days, I never had the heart to leave the Communist Party. Only the Communist Party can save China. This is what I have always firmly believed. In the eight years since liberation, I have been satisfied with everything that the people and I have obtained. If there is a problem with my thinking, it is that my position is too high, my life is too good, and my contribution to the people is too little. I have good wishes, but I have no intention of being anti-Communist; I have patriotic enthusiasm, but I have no intention of being anti-socialist, and I have no "great talent" to create my own set. I love the Communist Party, I love socialism; I am willing to work forever for the prosperity and strength of the motherland; I am more willing to live forever in the lovely embrace of the beautiful and warm socialist motherland. What other way can I go except to follow the Communist Party wholeheartedly forever?

Representatives, I have made mistakes, and I accept any criticism, especially the criticism of the current mistakes. I can only face my mistakes and resolutely correct them. It's just that the reason why I made mistakes was because of a stumble, not because of my own volition. Therefore, I have the courage to ask you not to abandon me, this prodigal son who has lost his way, and I ask you to forgive me. Recently, my mood has been heavy and difficult to describe in words; I feel that I have been wronged, so I am hesitant, pessimistic, disappointed, and painful. I almost lost my confidence in everything in the world. I am ashamed to open my eyes in front of my loved ones: my elderly mother, my virtuous wife, and my innocent and lively daughter. I am afraid that they will suspect me, hate me, and finally leave me. Now, I have woken up, and I realize that only optimism, struggle, thorough understanding of mistakes, and correction of mistakes are the ways for people to embark on the bright road of self-salvation. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, whether you are an enemy or a friend, whether it is true love or fake love, there are objective facts to rely on. Any concealment and sophistry are in vain; personal gains and losses should not be taken to heart.

Dear representatives! Let me assure you once again: I am determined to devote myself to the cruel battle on the ideological front, thoroughly draw a line between myself and Zhang Bojun's reactionary political line, stand firm, strengthen learning, strengthen transformation, and strive for continuous progress; I ask you to reach out and criticize me and help me. I also guarantee to you: resolutely support the Communist Party with action, resolutely support socialism with action; for this, I am unreservedly ready to contribute my last remaining segment of life at any time. Long live the Communist Party of China!

### 请求人民的宽恕  黄琪翔的发言

    请求人民的宽恕
    黄琪翔的发言
    请允许我以十分沉痛的心情在这里发言。
    我在农工民主党的职务是副主席兼秘书长，和章伯钧有组织关系和工作关系，并且在思想上和行动上做了章伯钧的俘虏，我对此愿意彻底交代和批判。
    以民主同盟为活动中心的章罗联盟，在农工民主党内是得到我的支持的。整风期间，我参加了农工民主党北京市委会所组织的所谓座谈会，到处起点火作用，造成了共产党威信上重大的损失；章伯钧的反共、反社会主义罪行被揭露以后，他要做假检讨，我又盲目地帮助了他。我在章伯钧问题上所犯的错误是严重的，是无可置辩的。
    我和章伯钧过去多年相识，解放以后，共事也已足有八年。章伯钧的政客野心家面目，凡是有一点政治嗅觉的人都早已察觉到了。八年以来，特别是最近两年以来，章伯钧的反共、反社会主义思想和言论冒头，而且有很多阴谋活动，我竟丝毫没有感觉，这是对人民事业完全不负责的态度，是不能推卸责任的。
    章伯钧的罪行被揭发以后，我迟疑观望，这说明我的思想深处和章伯钧有不少共同之点。我经常自负，以赤胆忠诚拥护共产党，拥护社会主义，但一接触实际，则一切都变成假象：人家骂共产党我无动于衷；人家说社会主义缺乏民主我也无动于衷；人家说苏联不好我默认；人家说资本主义好我暗中同情。一切一切，说明我对共产党没有真正的感情，对社会主义也没有真正的热爱。我经不住事实的考验。
    章伯钧罪行在全国人民面前揭露出来并且受到了严正的谴责以后，在相当长的时间内，我一直以为只是思想问题；大家批判，我也批判，实际上是不愿以认真严肃的态度来看待这一个关系到国家生死存亡的思想上的阶级斗争问题。不但如此，我因为立场不稳，认识模糊，对人民没有真爱，对敌人也就没有真恨，所以就想替章伯钧解脱，以为这样才算得帮助“朋友”；因此揭发也好，批判也好，根本上软弱无力，令人不能忍耐。在这种思想指导之下，我在农工民主党内负了领导检查章伯钧罪行小组的工作，显然是不相称的，工作方法也不可能不是错误的，因此受到了群众的指责和怀疑，是完全应该的，我在此表示接受群众对我有益的教训。
    章伯钧的反共、反社会主义言论和行动从何而来呢？他原不过是一个流氓马路政客，解放以后，人民待他不薄，为什么他还不满足而要想入非非甚至不惜与人民为敌呢？这就说明追求最高利润的资产阶级思想的毒害性与危险性是难以想像的。俗话说的“做了皇帝想神仙”和今天帝国主义者以原子战争威胁来维持剥削制度等等，都是从这种反动的思想发展起来的。拿我个人来说，为什么会跟着章伯钧走呢？我认为主要的就是我的思想方向和他是相同的，我在向他学习。思想相同，行动就不妨彼此互相利用，因此我很自然地支持了章伯钧是不足奇怪的。
    章伯钧六月十四日在报上发表的“检讨”，我是起了参谋作用的。十三日夜里他把我接到家里去，说是有人告诉他形势紧张，应该赶快做检讨，以免农工民主党受影响，并且要我帮助他。当时我知道他思想上还不通，没法检讨，但又认为他表示承认错误是好的，“堡垒”投降（章伯钧自己说的）也是好的，因此我没有拒绝帮助他。一直到最近以前，我还以为这事并没有做错。经过同志们指出，我终于认识到这就是一种严重的错误。我不仅是替章伯钧改假检讨，假投降；在思想上来说，我就等于替自己做假检讨，假投降，企图蒙混过关。这是一种不老实的态度和对人民事业不负责的态度的具体表现。
    我是一个封建地主家庭出身而又长期生活在旧社会的军人，我在历史上是有污点的，后来又沾染上不少欧美资产阶级社会生活的毒素。青年时代，无疑我的思想是封建的；大革命以后，二十年间又渗杂了一些资产阶级思想。解放后，我受到了共产党的教育，但进步很慢，留恋旧的多于接受新的；资产阶级思想和封建残余思想浓厚地潜藏在我的灵魂深处；马克思列宁主义思想的立场、观点和方法，对我来说，简直还无法掌握运用。就在这一次反右派斗争中我暴露了：
    1．章伯钧和我经常接触，经常听到他的反动言论，而我毫不在意，这不仅是说明我对他完全失去警惕，而且说明了他的思想毒素已经毫无抵抗地侵入了我的脑子里。
    2．我发觉了章伯钧的荒谬言论，既不和他争论，又不及时反映，这说明了客观上我是包庇了他的，我有严重的政治责任。
    3．我学习了毛主席的“团结、批评、团结”的政策，不求甚解，而只片面强调了团结，放弃原则，不敢批评，更不敢斗争，遇事迁就章伯钧，以致造成严重的错误。我的思想根源是愿意和章伯钧胡混在一起，作个人打算，而没有把人民事业放在眼里。
    4．当六月十三日夜里章伯钧来接我去帮助他作假检讨的时候，明明站在我面前的已经是一个敌人而还看不清，甘心给他利用，这说明了我的温情主义和个人主义已经稳稳地占了征服的地位，以致失掉了人民的立场，为章伯钧打掩护，混过关。客观上就是攻守同盟。
    5．在工作方法上，我从来就犯主观，急躁，脱离群众的毛病，这是和我的资产阶级个人主义、自高自大的作风分不开的。与章伯钧问题的严重性揭发。我的拖拉软弱的领导方法以及揭露不彻底的事实受到了群众的怀疑以后，我十分苦恼。但自以为是，不虚心找人商量，也不向领导方面恳切表示斗争的决心和请求具体帮助，这是一种极大的错误。恰好，这时农工民主党和民盟中委陕西省副省长韩兆鹗竟在前门饭店四出活动，说有人要把章伯钧一棍子打死，表示“抱不平”，而且私自提出检查小组组成人员名单，向人征求同意，企图为章伯钧解脱。韩兆鹗和章伯钧的交情是并不好的，为甚么他这次偏偏那样卖力气走非组织路线为章伯钧图解脱呢？刚说温情是不够的，实际上是有不可告人之隐的。韩兆鹗既然决心脱裤子，就应该把这事内容源源本本彻底交代出来。至于我个人在这个问题上所取得的教训，是我知道了韩兆鹗的阴谋活动，只采取鄙视态度，不加制止；反而沉不住气，借故把他批评一顿，而自己的思想也陷于混乱，因此便加重了工作领导方法上错误的严重性。
    代表们，经过深刻反省，我认为我的错误是严重的，责任是无可逃避的；我做了章伯钧的俘虏，我参加了章伯钧的罪恶活动，我的思想深处严重地存在着资产阶级的思想本质，而且还有不少的封建残余，因此行动上就表现为敌我不分、投机取巧、对人民工作不负责以及温情对人直至甘心作俘虏等等，这种思想的发展，结果就是走上反党、反社会主义道路而毫不自觉。
    章伯钧的罪行已经揭破了，全国人民正在继续对章伯钧的罪行进行揭发和批判，并且继续和章伯钧及一切右派分子作坚决的斗争。曾经犯过严重错误的我对此愿意正直地向代表们表示：我承认自己的错误，警惕自己，保证以后不再犯错误；并且立誓在政治上和思想上彻底和章伯钧划清界限，站在人民的立场，坚决和章伯钧路线斗争到底。到现在为止，我已经感觉到，反右派的阶级斗争，对我是毕生第一次大痛苦，同时又是幸福时代的开始；没有这个斗争，我就不可能摆脱旧的思想意识，也就不可能分清敌我、明辨是非；没有这个斗争，我就难免终于掉在泥沟，成为时代狂流中的残渣，而自绝于人民。今后我只有加强学习，加强改造，以争取不断进步。
    自从一九二七年大革命失败以后，二十年间，我逃亡，我投蒋，我反蒋，我抗日行动表现动摇，但思想上没有一时一刻离开共产党，即令在最艰难的日子里我也从来不忍离开共产党；只有共产党才能救中国，这是我始终深信不疑的。解放八年以来，我满足于人民和我自己所得到的一切。如果说我思想上还有问题的话，那就是我的地位过高，生活过优，而对人民的贡献太少。我有善良的愿望，而决无反共之心；我有爱国的热情，而决无反社会主义，自搞一套的“雄才大略”。我爱共产党，我爱社会主义；我愿意永远为祖国的富强繁荣事业而奋斗；我更愿意永远生活在美丽温暖的社会主义祖国的可爱的怀抱里。除了一心一意永远跟着共产党走以外我还有什么路可走呢？
    代表们，我是犯了错误的，任何批评，我都接受，特别是对于当前的错误的批评。我只有正视自己的错误，坚决改正错误。只是我犯错误的原因是由于失足而不是由于自愿，因此我有勇气来请求你们，不要遗弃我这曾经迷失道路的浪子，并且请求你们宽恕。最近以来，我的心情沉重难以语言刻画的；我觉得自己受到冤屈，因此我彷徨、悲观、失望、痛苦，我几乎失掉了对于人间一切的信心。我羞愧到不敢在我的亲爱的人：我的年老的母亲、我的贤良的妻子、我的天真活泼的女儿的面前睁开眼睛。我怕他们怀疑我，憎恨我，最后离开我。现在，我清醒过来了，我认识到只有乐观奋斗彻底认识错误，纠正错误，才是人们走上光明自救的大道；在中国共产党英明领导之下，是敌人是朋友，是真爱是假爱，自有客观事实可据，任何隐瞒和狡辩，都是枉费心机；个人得失荣辱，更不应该介意。
    敬爱的代表们！让我再一次向你们保证：我决心投入思想战线上的残酷战斗，和章伯钧反动政治路线彻底划清界限，站稳立场，加强学习，加强改造，争取不断进步；请求你们伸出手来，批评我，帮助我。我并且还向你们保证：坚决以行动来拥护共产党，坚决以行动来拥护社会主义；为着这个，我毫无保留地随时准备着贡献出我仅存的最后一段生命。中国共产党万岁！
