    Tackling Waterlogging is a Good Way to Increase Grain Production
    Jilin Waterlogging Control Project Mostly Completed
    (Our newspaper Changchun dispatch) The waterlogging control projects planned for this year in Jilin Province have been mostly completed. The total investment in the projects amounts to more than 1.42 million yuan, with 1.95 million cubic meters of earthwork completed, protecting an area of over 79,000 hectares of farmland.
    Waterlogging has always been one of the main reasons for reduced grain production in Jilin Province. In 1956, the total area affected by floods in the province reached more than 960,000 hectares, of which waterlogged areas accounted for more than 585,000 hectares, about 60% of the total flooded area. In the past, there was a lack of overall planning in waterlogging control, and only emphasis was placed on digging ditches for drainage, without implementing the principle of combining storage and discharge. This year's control projects have paid attention to correcting some of the past shortcomings. Of course, it is not enough to rely solely on state-invested projects. Small-scale, mass-based waterlogging control projects should not be ignored either.

    治理内涝是增产粮食的好方法
    吉林内涝治理工程大部竣工
    本报长春电  吉林省今年计划修建的内涝治理工程已大部竣工。全部工程投资额达一百四十二万多元，完成土方量一百九十五万公方，保田面积可达七万九千多公顷。
    吉林省内涝灾害一直成为粮食减产的主要原因之一，1956年全省水灾面积达到九十六万多公顷，其中内涝面积就有五十八万五千多公顷，占水灾总面积60％左右。过去，在治理内涝方面，缺少全面规划，只强调挖沟排水，没有贯彻蓄泄兼顾的原则，今年的治理工程已注意纠正过去的一些缺点。当然单纯依靠国家投资兴建的工程是不够的，群众性的小型治涝工程也不容忽视。
