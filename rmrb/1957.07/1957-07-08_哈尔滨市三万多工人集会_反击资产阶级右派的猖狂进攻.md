Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 6th. More than 30,000 workers in Harbin rallied on the evening of the 5th to refute the reactionary remarks of rightist elements.

    Du Shuhua, a steel worker from the Northeast Third Engineering Company, spoke at the rally, using his own personal experiences to illustrate the enormous changes between the old and new societies. He said that now we workers have labor protection and our lives have improved. Recently, I had high blood pressure, and the factory sent me to a sanatorium for recuperation. This was something I could never have dreamed of in the old society. No matter how the rightists spread rumors, we love the Communist Party.

    Xu Minda, a female worker from the Harbin Linen Textile Factory, said, "The rightists say that socialist construction is 'all dark.' Let them open their eyes and take a look at our linen factory! In 1949, this place was still a wilderness, but by 1952, this modern factory was built. Near our factory, the Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory and the Electric Motor Factory have also been built. Under the leadership of the Party, our factory reached the production level of the first Five-Year Plan more than a year ahead of schedule. Last year, our factory's labor productivity increased by 173.5% compared to 1953. The rightists are trying to deny our construction achievements. Isn't this blatant lying?" A total of six people, including workers and technicians, spoke at the meeting.

    On the same day, hundreds of thousands of workers in Harbin listened to the live broadcast of the meeting.

    哈尔滨市三万多工人集会
    反击资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻
    新华社哈尔滨6日电　5日傍晚，哈尔滨市三万多工人集会驳斥右派分子的反动言论。
    东北第三工程公司钢筋工人杜树华在大会上讲话，以他自己的亲身经历说明新旧社会的巨大变化。他说，现在我们工人有劳动保护，生活都改善了。我最近血压高，工厂还送我到疗养所休养，这在旧社会是做梦也想不到的。不管右派分子怎样造谣，我们是热爱共产党的。
    哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂女工徐敏达说，右派分子说什么社会主义建设“一团黑”，就让他们睁开眼睛来看看我们的亚麻厂吧，1949年这块地方还是一片荒野，到1952年就建成了这座近代化的大工厂。在我们厂附近，量具刃具厂、电机厂也建设起来了。在党的领导下，我们厂提前一年多达到了第一个五年计划的生产水平。去年，我们厂的劳动生产率比1953年提高了173.5％。右派分子企图否定我们建设的成就，这不是睁着眼睛说瞎话吗？在会上发言的有工人、技术人员共六人。
    当天，哈尔滨市还有十几万工人收听了会场的实况广播。
