Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 29th: Kathmandu dispatch: Nepal's new Prime Minister, Dr. K.I. Singh, stated on July 28th that Nepal's current diplomatic relations will remain unchanged.

In his first policy statement broadcast, made within forty-eight hours of taking over the government of Nepal, Singh emphasized the "age-old" relationship between Nepal and India. He said that the religious, cultural, and geographical ties between Nepal and India are a "natural fact," and no one should harbor resentment towards this connection.

Singh believes that Nepal needs foreign cooperation in the economic field. However, he said that only Nepal's "closest neighbors" should be given the opportunity to participate in Nepal's industrial activities.

When discussing domestic affairs, Singh said that his government will implement a four-point program to improve the country's current "backward situation." He expressed his intention to make every effort to "rectify the national disorder." The new Prime Minister's proposed minimum national program is as follows: (1) To hold fair elections as quickly as possible; (2) To deal with the current dangerous food situation "to the best of our ability"; (3) To resolve the land issue "within an appropriate timeframe and to the extent possible"; (4) To eliminate corruption, injustice, illegal activities, and other malpractices "as quickly as possible," and to increase national income with "maximum effort."

    辛格发表政策声明
    尼泊尔外交关系不变
    据新华社新德里29日电　加德满都消息：尼泊尔新首相辛格博士7月28日说，尼泊尔目前的外交关系不会有改变。
    辛格在接管尼泊尔政府工作后四十八小时内发表的第一篇政策声明广播中，强调了尼泊尔同印度之间“自古以来”就有的关系。他说，尼泊尔同印度在宗教、文化和地理上的联系是“天然实事”，谁也不应该有反对这种联系的情绪。
    辛格认为尼泊尔在经济方面需要外国的合作。但是他说，只能对尼泊尔“最亲密的邻邦”提供参与尼泊尔的工业活动的机会。
    辛格在谈到国内事务的时候说，他的政府将执行四点纲领来改进国家目前的“落后情况”。他表示要尽一切努力“整顿全国的紊乱情况”。新首相提出的国家最低纲领如下：（一）尽可能快地举行公正的选举；（二）“尽我们所能”处理目前粮食方面的危险情况；（三）“在适当的时限和可能范围内”解决土地问题；（四）“尽可能快地”消灭贪污、不公正行动、违法现象等弊端，并且用“最大的努力”增加国民收入。
