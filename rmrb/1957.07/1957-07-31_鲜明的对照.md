A Stark Contrast
By Our Staff Commentator

On July 27, the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, issued a statement on the question of German reunification. On July 29, the governments of the United States, Great Britain, France, and West Germany also issued a declaration in Berlin on the same issue. A comparison of these two documents clearly reveals who genuinely desires the reunification of Germany and who is striving to deepen the division of Germany.

To resolve the German question, the specific circumstances of Germany's existence must be taken into account. Today, two states of different natures exist in Germany: the German Democratic Republic, which, in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, has eliminated the forces of militarism, confiscated the property of monopoly capital and large landowners, and embarked on the path of peace and socialism; and the Federal Republic of Germany, where the Potsdam Agreement has been violated, the forces of militarism have regained power, and Hitler's Wehrmacht is being rebuilt.

Under these circumstances, any plan to restore German unity must proceed from this reality. Otherwise, it will only be empty talk. Based on this situation, the government of the German Democratic Republic has repeatedly appealed to and made suggestions to West Germany, advocating that both sides send representatives to seek an agreement on restoring national unity through consultation and understanding. However, the Western countries and the West German government have insisted on not recognizing the existence of the German Democratic Republic and have consistently rejected this reasonable suggestion.

This time, the German Democratic Republic put forward a new proposal, advocating that East and West Germany form a federation as a preliminary step towards German unification, while also demanding that an agreement be reached first to prohibit the storage and production of atomic weapons on German soil; that both Germanies withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, abolish conscription, and reach an agreement on the strength of their respective armies. The proposal also called on the Four Powers to withdraw their troops from the entirety of Germany. Considering the different situations of the two Germanies, this federation does not necessarily have to discuss the further development of West Germany or the German Democratic Republic at this stage, but can first reach an agreement on certain issues, such as the economy, tariffs, currency, transportation, and news, to implement a common policy. In this way, the German Democratic Republic's proposal avoids resolving issues for which conditions are not yet ripe and strives to reach an agreement on some commonly related issues in order to improve relations between East and West Germany and create favorable conditions for German reunification.

However, this new effort by the German Democratic Republic was immediately unreasonably rejected by the Western countries and the West German government. Their hasty rejection shows that they are very afraid that this reasonable proposal will arouse the hope of the West German people for the restoration of German unity. This would be detrimental to their policy of maintaining the division of Germany.

After rejecting the specific proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic, they issued a declaration, trying their best to portray themselves as the creators of German unity and the creators of peace. However, as the British "Manchester Guardian" said, this declaration "says nothing new." The declaration avoids mentioning the proposals put forward by the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, the declaration insists on calling the West German government "the only government qualified to speak for all the German people"; the declaration still insists on using the old method of so-called "free elections" to unify Germany and emphasizes that the unified Germany has the right to participate in the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization military bloc. In this way, the declaration neither wants to recognize the reality that there are two Germanies, nor does it agree that the future unified Germany should not participate in any aggressive group, and any plan for a unified Germany must have this guarantee in order to conform to the interests of European security.

The facts are very clear that any all-German election is impossible without understanding and consultation between the two Germanies. Before the forces of militarism have been eliminated in West Germany and foreign troops have not been completely withdrawn, the so-called "free elections" there will be nothing more than a beautiful lie. The purpose of "all-German elections" under these circumstances is nothing more than to attempt to use the majority of the West German population to annex the German Democratic Republic, put the entire Germany in the hands of the forces of militarism, and thus become a larger atomic war base against the socialist camp.

Why did the Western countries and the West German government choose this time to issue this declaration? This is to cope with the upcoming West German general election. The German unification issue is an important issue in this year's election, and the Adenauer government's policy of obstructing German unification has been opposed by the broad masses of the West German people. In order to strengthen Adenauer's position in the election, they want to launch a propaganda offensive before the election using this declaration, pretending to "eagerly desire" German reunification and shirking their responsibility for dividing Germany, so as to deceive voters. Reuters pointed out in its report the value of this declaration "as an election document to Adenauer." Everyone knows that Western countries are helping Adenauer's party to continue in power in various ways.

The Western countries and the West German government hastily issued this declaration with ulterior motives after the new proposal of the German Democratic Republic was put forward, originally wanting to dilute the impact of this constructive proposal. However, the public has the opportunity to make a comparison, distinguish between sincere and practical efforts and false and empty propaganda, and draw the conclusions they deserve.

    7月27日，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥就德国重新统一问题发表了声明。29日，美、英、法三国和西德政府在柏林也就同一问题发表了一项宣言。对比之下，把这两个文件作一对比，就可清楚地看出：究竟谁是真正希望德国的重新统一，而谁又在竭力加深德国的分裂。
    要解决德国问题，必须考虑到德国存在的具体状况。今天在德国存在着两个性质不同的国家：一个是德意志民主共和国，它根据波茨坦宣言的规定，清除了军国主义的势力，没收了垄断资本和大地主的财产，走上了和平和社会主义的道路。一个是德意志联邦共和国，在那里，波茨坦协定遭到了破坏，军国主义势力重新掌权，希特勒的国防军又在重建。
    在这种形势下，恢复德国统一的任何方案，都必须从这个现实出发。否则就只能是空谈。根据这种情况，德意志民主共和国政府曾经多次向西德发出呼吁和建议，主张由双方互派代表，通过协商和谅解，来求得恢复国家统一的协议。但是西方国家和西德政府坚持不承认德意志民主共和国存在的事实，一直拒绝这项合理建议。
    这次德意志民主共和国提出了新的建议，主张东西德组成联邦，作为德国统一的初步步骤，同时要求：首先达成协议，禁止在德国土地上存放和生产原子武器；两个德国分别退出北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约，取消征兵制，就双方军队的实力问题达成协议。建议中还向四大国呼吁，撤出他们在德国全境的军队。考虑到两个德国的不同情况，这个联邦目前并不一定要讨论有关西德或民主德国的进一步发展的问题，而可以先只对某些问题，例如经济、关税、货币问题、运输和新闻等问题方面达成一个实行共同政策的协定。这样，民主德国的建议既避免了解决条件目前还未成熟的那些问题，又争取在一些共同有关的问题上达成协议，以便改善东西德之间的关系，为德国的重新统一创造有利的条件。
    但是，德意志民主共和国这一新努力，又立即遭到了西方国家和西德政府的无理拒绝。他们如此匆忙就加以拒绝，说明他们非常害怕这种合理的建议会引起西德人民对恢复德国统一的希望。这将不利于他们的保持德国分裂的政策。
    他们在一口拒绝了德意志民主共和国提出的具体建议之后，却发表了一个宣言，竭力把自己装扮成为德国统一的创导者和和平的缔造者。但是，正像英国“曼彻斯特卫报”所说的，这个宣言“没有说什么新东西”。宣言对德意志民主共和国提出的建议避而不谈。宣言同时硬把西德政府说成是“有资格代表全体德国人民发言的唯一政府”；宣言中依然坚持用所谓“自由选举”的老办法来统一德国，并且强调统一后的德国有权参加侵略性的北大西洋公约军事集团。这样，宣言既不愿意承认有两个德国存在的现实，又拒绝同意将来统一后的德国应当不参加任何侵略集团的主张，而任何统一德国的计划都必须要有这种保证，才能符合欧洲安全的利益。
    事实很清楚，没有两个德国之间的谅解和协商，任何全德的选举都是不可能的。在西德还没有肃清军国主义势力并且外国军队没有完全撤出以前，所谓“自由选举”在那里将不过是一句漂亮的谎话。这种情况下的“全德选举”，其目的无非是企图利用西德人口方面的多数，来把德意志民主共和国吞并过去，使整个德国都掌握在军国主义势力的手里，从而成为一个更大的反对社会主义阵营的原子战争基地。
    西方国家和西德政府为什么要选择这个时候来发表这个宣言呢？这是为了应付即将到来的西德大选。德国统一问题是今年大选中一个重要问题，而阿登纳政府的阻挠德国统一的政策，遭到了广大西德人民的反对。为了加强阿登纳在竞选中的地位，他们想在大选前利用这个宣言发动一个宣传攻势，假装“热望”于德国的重新统一，推卸他们分裂德国的责任，这样来欺骗选民。路透社在它的报道中指出了这个宣言“作为竞选文件对阿登纳的价值”。大家都知道，西方国家正在以各种方法来帮助阿登纳党继续执政。
    西方国家和西德政府在德意志民主共和国的新建议提出之后，就匆忙发表他们这篇别有用心的宣言，原是想这样来冲淡这个建设性建议的影响。但是公众却有机会来作一对比，区别真诚切实的努力和虚伪空洞的宣传，并得出应得的结论。
