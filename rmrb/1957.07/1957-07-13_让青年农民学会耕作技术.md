    Get Young Farmers to Learn Farming Techniques

    (I)
    Farmers have always valued the transmission of farming techniques. In the past, when a rural child grew to fifteen or sixteen years old, they would almost always learn how to plow, harrow, and sow seeds. However, since cooperativization, a noteworthy new situation has emerged in some areas: a lack of attention to cultivating the production techniques of young people. In agricultural cooperatives, labor is divided according to individual strengths. Because some young people lack farming techniques or have very low levels of skill, they can only do simple tasks. As a result, they don't come into contact with plows, harrows, seeders, and other farm implements. If this continues, it will be difficult to improve the production technique levels of young people.

    To fully utilize the role of farmers, it is first necessary to enable them to use various farm implements. Especially now that a large number of students are going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, and they are all novices in production, the issue of training young people to learn agricultural techniques is even more important. How to solve this problem? In my opinion, in addition to carrying out organizational work, such as assigning unskilled young people as assistants to skilled farmers to give them opportunities to learn techniques, and organizing technical learning for young people during slack seasons, it is also necessary to do a good job of ideological education. This work mainly involves mobilizing the older generation of farmers to patiently pass on their farming techniques to the younger generation and educating young farmers to humbly learn from the older generation of farmers. 　Zheng Jicheng

    (II)
    Based on the situation in our county, agricultural cooperatives have a dangerous tendency: since the mutual aid teams (as early as 1950), there has been an emphasis on adapting to individual abilities and rationally assigning labor, but the cultivation of production techniques for the younger generation has been neglected. Basically, the technically demanding tasks are done by middle-aged and elderly people. Before liberation, adult farmers here could master general farming techniques because they had little labor and many tasks; they had to learn. But the situation is quite different after collective production. In the Gaochao Cooperative's six and seven production teams in Xishui, Hubei, there are 45 male farmers between the ages of fourteen and fifty, fourteen of whom are under twenty-five. These young people under twenty-five have consistently done simple tasks such as carrying and hauling, so they cannot master more complex farming techniques. The 26-year-old "technician" Zhang Zuyun still doesn't know how to use oxen or sow rice seeds. The six-team technician, Zhang Wenqing (24 years old), mustered the courage to request to sow rice seeds, but the results were bad. Many production team cadres in the cooperatives believe that this is a major problem, and every cooperative has this situation.

### 让青年农民学会耕作技术

    让青年农民学会耕作技术
    （一）
    农民向来就很重视传授耕作技术的。过去，一个农村的孩子长到十五六岁时，差不多都要学会犁、耙、耩种。但是，合作化以后，某些地区出现了一种值得注意的新情况：不注意培养青年人的生产技术。农业社在生产劳动中是根据个人的特长分工的，由于有些青年没有耕作技术或者耕作技术很低，他们就只能作些简单的活，因此就接触不到犁、耙、耧等农具，长此以往，青年人的生产技术水平很难提高。
    要想充分发挥农民的作用，必须首先使农民学会使用各种农具。特别是目前有大批学生下乡参加农业生产，而他们都是生产上的外行，因此培养青年人学会农业技术的问题，就更加重要了。怎样解决这个问题？我认为除了进行组织工作，叫没有技术的青年作有技术农民的助手，给他们有学习技术的机会，在农闲时组织青年进行技术学习以外，还必须做好思想教育工作。这工作主要是动员老一辈农民把自己的耕作技术耐心地传授给青年一代；教育青年农民虚心向老一辈农民学习。　郑记成
    （二）
    从我们县的情况看来，各农业社存在着这样一个危险的倾向：自从互助组起（1950年就有），只强调了因人制宜、合理排工，而忽视了培养年青一代人的生产技术；凡是带技术性的活路，基本上都是壮年和老年人搞。解放前，我们这里的成年农民都能掌握一般耕作技术，因为那时他们劳力少，事情多，不学不行。可是集体生产以后的情况就大不相同了，湖北浠水高潮社六、七两生产队，十四岁到五十岁上的男农民共四十五人，二十五岁以下的十四人，这些二十五岁以下的青年，由于一贯作些掮挑等简单活，因此不能掌握较繁的耕作技术。二十六岁的“技术员”张祖云还不会用耕牛、不会下谷种。六队技术员张文清（二十四岁），鼓起勇气要求下谷子，结果下坏了。许多社的生产队的干部都认为这是个大问题，各个社都有这样的情况。
