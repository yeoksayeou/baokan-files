Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 29th - Thanks to the relief efforts of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the disaster-stricken herdsmen of more than one hundred tribes in the Nagqu pastoral area of Tibet have successfully overcome the famine. The affected herdsmen have received more than 100,000 catties of grain, and some have also received tea and loans.

The eight disaster relief work groups representing the Central Government, the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which went to the pastoral areas for disaster relief, have recently returned to Nagqu. During the two months of disaster relief work, the work groups traveled almost throughout the entire Nagqu pastoral area, providing relief to more than 60% of the statistically recorded households.

The vast Nagqu pastoral area suffered from drought last year, followed by heavy snowfall last winter and this spring, resulting in severe deaths of cattle and sheep.

At present, the pastures in northern Tibet are lush with grass and water, and the cattle and sheep are strong and healthy. The herdsmen are working hard to restore production.

    西藏黑河区牧民度过灾荒
    新华社拉萨29日电　西藏黑河牧区一百多个部落的受灾牧民，经过中央人民政府和中国共产党的救济，已经顺利度过灾荒。受灾牧民得到粮食十万斤以上，有的还得到茶叶和贷款。
    代表中央和中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹备委员会到牧区救灾的八个救灾工作组，最近已全部回到黑河。在两个月的救灾工作中，工作组几乎走遍了整个黑河牧区，救济面达到统计户数的百分之六十多。
    广阔的黑河牧区，由于去年天旱，去冬今春又连降大雪，引起牛羊严重死亡。
    目前，藏北牧区水草丰盛，牛羊肥壮，牧民们正努力恢复生产。
