    Warsaw Dispatch from Our Newspaper, July 21st: On the eve of the National Day of the People's Republic of Poland, our reporter paid a special visit to Comrade Jędrychowski, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Polish Council of Ministers, to ask him about the achievements of Poland's socialist construction. The following are the questions posed by the reporter and his answers:
    Question: Could you please talk about the basic achievements of socialist construction since the establishment of the People's Republic of Poland?
    Answer: The thirteen years since the establishment of the People's Republic of Poland have been thirteen years of vigorous development of our country's productive forces. The transformation of the economic base, such as the land reform completed in 1945-1946 and the nationalization of the basic means of production, is the foundation for such rapid development of the national economy.
    The greatest achievement in thirteen years has been in the industrial sector. It is clear when comparing the present with the past. In 1937, before the war, the coal production averaged 1,054 kilograms per capita. In 1956, it was 3,420 kilograms per capita, which is 325% of 1937. In 1937, steel production was 43 kilograms per capita, while in 1956 it was 180 kilograms, equal to 418% of 1937. In 1937, electricity generation was 106 kilowatt-hours per capita, while in 1956 it was 700 kilowatt-hours, equal to 660% of 1937. In 1937, cement was 38 kilograms per capita, while in 1956 it was 145 kilograms, equal to 382% of 1937.
    Therefore, these simple figures show that we have taken a big leap forward on the road of national industrialization. This leap has greatly shortened the distance between us and the most developed capitalist countries in terms of industrial production. Compared with France, we lagged behind France in terms of per capita production of major industrial products before the war. In 1956, after thirteen years of our efforts, in terms of coal production, France had 1,270 kilograms per capita, while our country had 3,420 kilograms per capita. In terms of sugar production, France had 34 kilograms per capita, while our country had 40 kilograms per capita. Of course, there are still some products such as steel, electricity, and cement, where our per capita production is still lower than that of France.
    When talking about industrial achievements, we cannot forget that in the past thirteen years we have created some completely new industrial sectors that did not exist in the past. These are the shipbuilding industry, the automobile manufacturing industry, and the chemical industry.
    Another achievement of our industrialization is the increase in the number of people employed in industry. In 1955, the number of people employed in industry was 2.18 million. If the number of people employed in industry in 1937 is taken as 100, then 1955 would be 253.
    Our achievements in agriculture are not as good as in industry. This is due to many reasons, including the mistakes we made. But nevertheless, the output of four types of grain per capita still exceeds the pre-war level. In animal husbandry, the number of pigs in 1956 was 20% higher than in 1938. But the number of cattle is still lower than before the war.
    We have also made considerable progress in agricultural mechanization. There were almost no tractors on Polish land before the war, while in 1956 there were 64,000 tractors working. In terms of electrification, only 1,263 rural areas were electrified in 1938, while 15,056 rural areas were electrified in 1955.
    Question: Could you please talk about the improvement of people's living standards since the establishment of the People's Republic of Poland?
    Answer: The improvement of living standards has been uneven over the past period. There have been periods of rapid development and periods of stagnation. Before 1951, living standards improved relatively quickly. This is because we quickly restored industrial and agricultural production. Moreover, restoration always costs less than reconstruction. During the period 1951-1953, we shifted from restoration to intense construction of the national economy. Not only did we build new factories, but we also created entirely new industrial sectors, including the defense industry. This placed too heavy a burden on the national income. In addition, poor agricultural harvests caused a temporary slight decline in people's living standards. From 1954, people's living standards began to rise again. After 1955, living standards continued to rise faster. Compared with the pre-war period, in 1955, the per capita consumption of meat and fat was 199% of 1938. Milk and dairy products were 128.7% of 1938. Sugar consumption was 250% of 1938. Wool consumption was 250% of 1938. Paper consumption was 244% of 1938. In the past year, we have generally increased the wages of workers. In 1957, the average wage of workers in socialist enterprises will increase by 19% compared with 1955. According to the five-year plan passed by the Polish Parliament a few days ago, by 1960, workers' wages will increase by 30% compared with 1955. The actual income of farmers will also increase by 30% compared with 1955.
    This rate of growth is rare in capitalist countries.

    波国家计划委员会主席答本报记者问
    波兰十三年来社会主义建设成就巨大
    生产力蓬勃发展人民生活水平显著提高
    本报华沙21日专电　在波兰人民共和国国庆日前夕，记者特走访波兰部长会议国家计划委员会主席英德里霍夫斯基同志，请他谈谈波兰社会主义建设的成就。下面是记者所提的问题和他的答复：
    问：请你谈谈波兰人民共和国成立以来社会主义建设的基本成就。
    答：波兰人民共和国成立以来的十三年是我国生产力蓬勃发展的十三年。经济基础的改造，如在1945—1946年完成的土地改革和基本生产资料的国有化等是国家经济如此迅速发展的基础。
    十三年来最大的成就是在工业方面。只要把现在同过去对比一下便可清楚。煤产量在战前1937年按人口平均计算，每个居民可分得一千零五十四公斤，而在1956年每人可分得三千四百二十公斤，即等于1937年的325％。钢产量在1937年每人可分得四十三公斤，而1956年为一百八十公斤，等于1937年的418％。发电量在1937年每人分得一百零六瓩时，而在1956年为七百瓩时，等于1937年的660％。水泥在1937年每人可分得三十八公斤，而在1956年为一百四十五公斤，等于1937年的382％。
    因此这些简单的数字表明我们在国家工业化的道路上跃进了一大步。这个跃进大大缩短了我们同世界上最发达的资本主义国家在工业生产量方面的距离。同法国来比，战前我们在主要工业品方面按人口平均计算都落后于法国。而在1956年，经过我们十三年的努力，在煤产量方面，法国每人可分得一千二百七十公斤，而我国每人可分得三千四百二十公斤，在糖产量方面，法国每人可分得三十四公斤，而我国每人可分得四十公斤。当然还有一些产品像钢、电力、水泥的产量按人口平均计算我们还低于法国。
    在谈到工业成就时，不能忘记我们在十三年中创造了一些过去没有的完全崭新的工业部门。这就是造船工业、汽车制造工业和化学工业。
    我们工业化的另一成就是在工业中就业人数的增加。在1955年，工业中的就业人数是二百十八万人。如果以1937年在工业中的就业人数为一百的话，1955年就是二百五十三。
    我们在农业方面的成就不如工业。这是由于许多原因造成的，其中包括我们犯的错误。但是虽然如此，四种谷物的产量按人口平均计仍然超过战前。在畜牧业方面猪的头数在1956年比1938年多20％。但牛的头数仍低于战前。
    我们在农业机械化方面也有不小的发展。战前在波兰的土地上几乎没有拖拉机而在1956年已有六万四千架拖拉机在工作。在电气化方面，1938年只有一千二百六十三个农村电气化，而在1955年已有一万五千零五十六个农村电气化了。
    问：请你谈谈波兰人民共和国成立以来人民生活水平提高的状况。
    答：过去一段时期里生活水平的提高是不平衡的。有发展较快的时期，也有停滞的时期。在1951年以前，生活水平的提高相当快。这是因为我们迅速地恢复了工业和农业的生产。而且恢复总是比重建花的钱少。在1951—1953年期间，我们从恢复转到紧张建设国民经济。不仅建设新的工厂，而且创建整个崭新的工业部门，包括国防工业。这就给国民收入背上了过重的负担。此外，由于农业收成不好，从而引起人民生活水平暂时的略微的下降。从1954年开始，人民生活水平又有上升。1955年后，生活水平继续较快地上升。同战前相比，1955年按人口平均计算，肉和脂肪的消耗量为1938年的199％。牛奶和奶制品为1938年的128.7％。糖的消耗量为1938年的250％。毛织品的消耗量为1938年的250％。纸的消耗量为1938年的244％。最近一年我们相当普遍地提高了职工的工资。1957年，社会主义企业职工的平均工资将比1955年增加19％。根据前几天波兰议会通过的五年计划，到1960年，职工的工资将比1955年增加30％。农民的实际收入也将比1955年增加30％。
    这种增长速度在资本主义国家是少有的。
