I fully agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports at the congress.

Since last year, our country's socialist revolution has achieved basic victory, and socialist construction has also achieved great successes, making it possible for us to complete and exceed the target of the first Five-Year Plan for the development of our national economy this year. Premier Zhou's report pointed out: This year will be recorded in our history as a year of great and glorious achievements. This is a year of great transformation. The working people of the whole country, all those who love the motherland, love the people, and love the cause of socialism, are rejoicing for this! The Chinese Communist Party has led the people of the whole country to achieve these great and glorious achievements. It is not complacent because of this. In order to achieve a complete victory in socialist construction, the Party Central Committee has decided to launch a rectification movement throughout the Party. The people of the whole country are enthusiastically supporting this correct measure of the Party and are helping the Party to carry out the rectification movement with a heart of love for the Party. However, the bourgeois right-wing elements believe that "the time has come." Under the guise of helping the Party to carry out the rectification movement, they engage in conspiracies and sabotage, using methods such as negating achievements, exaggerating mistakes, fabricating rumors and slanders, and instigating and agitating, to stir up trouble and light fires everywhere, opposing the leadership of the Communist Party, opposing the people's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system. But the people quickly saw through the conspiracies and tricks of the right-wing elements and angrily rose up to fight back. This is a serious class struggle on the ideological and political fronts, and we must carry this struggle through to the end and smash the conspiracies of the right-wing elements in order to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction.

50,000 People Denounce Luo Yiqun

The right-wing ambitious schemers' activities against socialism are conspiracies that have been prepared for a long time. Once they are set in motion, the right-wing elements in some places echo each other. The right-wing elements in Guangdong Province have tried their best to slander our achievements in rural work, spreading fallacies such as "Guangdong's agricultural cooperativization has been ruined" and "the lives of Guangdong's farmers are close to starvation." The right-wing element Luo Yiqun has recently been running around in the countryside, looking for materials about so-called "farmers close to starvation," spreading rumors and inciting people everywhere. He only dares to talk to landlords and counter-revolutionaries under surveillance, and does not dare to meet with workers and peasants. When Luo Yiqun arrived in his hometown of Xingning County, he aroused the anger of 50,000 people, who held rallies and parades to denounce him, listing countless examples of improved living standards since liberation, refuting his shameless slanders. As a result, he had to flee in panic, hide, and request to be escorted back to the province.

Guangdong has made great achievements in various aspects of work since last year, whether in industrial and agricultural production, cultural education, or the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. But the right-wing elements have tried their best to negate these achievements, especially focusing on negating our achievements in rural work. Now I will talk about the actual situation of rural work in Guangdong.

Guangdong Has Changed from a Grain-Deficient Province to a Province with a Surplus of Grain for External Transfer

Ninety-five percent of the farmers in Guangdong Province have been organized into agricultural cooperatives. Due to the superiority of the socialist economic system and relying on the hard work of all cooperative members, we have both established cooperatives and carried out production. Despite the weak foundation of agricultural cooperatives, lack of experience in running cooperatives, and severe natural disasters, we have still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. Last year, the total output value of agricultural and sideline production reached 3.385 billion yuan, an increase of 12.55 percent over the previous year. The total grain output reached 24 billion jin, an increase of 9.8 percent over the previous year, 50 percent over 1949, and 40 percent over 1936, the highest output before liberation. In the first three years of the first Five-Year Plan, the average annual increase in grain production was 1 billion jin, while last year alone, it increased by 2.1 billion jin. Last year, the total output value of cash crops in the province also increased by 11 percent over the previous year. More than 70 percent of the agricultural cooperatives in the province increased production, and more than 75 percent of the cooperative members increased their income. The number of counties with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu increased from three to six, and the number of cooperatives with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu increased from 850 to 3,670. More than 2,000 cooperatives have caught up with the average income level of upper-middle peasants. This great development of agricultural production is unprecedented in Guangdong's history. Everyone knows that Guangdong was a grain-deficient province before liberation. Now, it has not only achieved self-sufficiency, but can also transfer a portion externally to support national construction. Before liberation, most farmers had only 200 to 250 jin of rice ration per person, excluding miscellaneous grains. Now, they generally have about 400 jin (a total of 500 jin including miscellaneous grains converted to grain). In the Pearl River Delta rice-producing area, it is even as high as 600 to 700 jin. Last year, the social purchasing power in rural areas of the province increased by 10.68 percent over the previous year. The sales volume of cloth increased by 35.87 percent, an average increase of more than two zhang per household. Singlets increased by 42 percent, towels increased by 30 percent, sugar increased by 23.16 percent, and edible oil increased by 17 percent. Only the supply of pork has decreased somewhat, and measures are being taken to improve it. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the social inventory of live pigs will reach 10 million head, and then the supply of pork can also be increased.

Faced with such facts, the right-wing elements stubbornly insist that "agricultural cooperativization has been ruined" and "the lives of farmers are close to starvation." The right-wing elements put on a compassionate posture, pretending to be "representatives of farmers' interests," and accuse us of not caring about the suffering of the farmers. However, the farmers of Guangdong know that the first workers' and peasants' Soviet regime that distributed land to farmers was established in Guangdong under the leadership of the Communist Party. Later, the Communist Party led the farmers to persist in the revolutionary guerrilla war for more than 20 years. And at that time, it was precisely these disguised representatives of farmers' interests who oppressed and exploited the farmers. The farmers of Guangdong know that since liberation, it is the Communist Party that has led the farmers in carrying out land reform and agricultural cooperativization, and has led the farmers to increase production and improve their lives. Just to mention this spring, in order to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture, 158,000 cadres and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army directly participated in agricultural labor, helping farmers to accumulate fertilizer and build water conservancy projects. In May this year, floods rose sharply in various rivers in Guangdong. Tens of thousands of cadres and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army worked with the farmers to build dikes, prevent floods, and carry out rescue operations, overcoming the floods. In the struggle against the floods, six Communist Party members and three Communist Youth League members gave their lives. The farmers of Guangdong fully understand that only the Communist Party cares about the suffering of the farmers and truly represents the interests of the farmers. The right-wing elements' attempt to provoke the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the farmers is not only a futile effort, but is also destined to be severely attacked by the farmers.

We Warmly Welcome Well-Intentioned Criticism from Non-Party Members

The malicious attacks of the right-wing elements on the Communist Party are fundamentally different from the well-intentioned criticism of non-Party members. We resolutely counterattack the attacks of the right-wing elements, but we warmly welcome the well-intentioned criticism of non-Party members. We never hide our shortcomings and mistakes in our work. Taking agricultural production as an example, we once had a tendency to be one-sided in production guidance during the high tide of cooperativization, focusing on grain and neglecting diversified operations. When promoting advanced technologies, many regions did not combine them with local conditions and had a compulsory command style. The operation and management of cooperatives is not yet perfect, and the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically has not been implemented well enough, and so on. After we discovered these shortcomings and mistakes, we corrected them immediately. In this rectification movement, many non-Party members have put forward many beneficial criticisms and suggestions to us, which have been very helpful to our work. We are very grateful for their help.

We understand that only by constantly exposing and overcoming the shortcomings and mistakes in our work can we make our cause continue to advance and ensure that we achieve greater victories. On March 26th this year, the masses in Lanshan Township, Huazhou County, Guangdong, rioted in opposition to the construction of a leper village. Chen Lida, the director of the county public security bureau, ordered the shooting, resulting in the tragic incident of five people being killed and nine people being injured. We immediately conducted a serious investigation and punished the perpetrators. The director of the public security bureau who caused the incident was sentenced to life imprisonment, and other derelict personnel were given criminal or administrative punishments respectively. This painful incident deeply educated us and all cadres, and made us understand how to correctly handle contradictions among the people. For example, when cadres in Haifeng County handled the conflict among the masses in Haiwu Township, they adopted correct methods of persuasion and education, which reconciled the impending armed fight and prevented a major disaster from occurring. We must earnestly study Chairman Mao's instructions on "the question of correctly handling contradictions among the people," and are determined to conduct an in-depth examination of the shortcomings and mistakes in our work in the rectification movement, further strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses, strengthen the unity of the people, and improve our work. Our cause is brilliant, our ranks are vast and strong, and our socialist road is unshakable. We must implement the rectification movement, continue to study, work hard to practice, and strive for progress; we must also continue to deepen the struggle against the right-wing elements, and unite with the people of the whole country to move forward together!

    广东农业的大发展史无先例
    古大存的发言
    我完全同意周总理的政府工作报告和大会上其他各项报告。
    去年以来，我国的社会主义革命已经取得基本胜利，社会主义建设也获得巨大成绩，使我们有可能在今年完成和超额完成发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划。周总理报告指出：这一年就是以这些伟大光辉的成就载入我国史册的一年。这是伟大的转变的一年。全国劳动人民，一切爱祖国、爱人民、爱社会主义事业的人们，都为此而欢欣鼓舞！中国共产党领导全国人民取得了这些伟大光辉的成就，它并不因此而自满，为了社会主义建设取得彻底胜利，党中央决定在全党开展整风运动。全国人民都热烈地拥护党这一正确的措施，都以热爱党的心情来帮助党进行整风。但是资产阶级右派分子却认为“是时候了”，他们在帮助党整风的名义下进行阴谋破坏，用抹煞成绩、夸大错误、造谣诬蔑、挑拨煽动等办法，兴风作浪，到处点火，反对共产党的领导，反对人民民主专政和社会主义制度。但人民很快便识破了右派分子的阴谋诡计，愤怒地群起反击。这是一场严重的思想上政治上的阶级斗争，必须把这一斗争进行到底，把右派分子的阴谋粉碎，才能保证社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。
    五万群众声讨罗翼群
    右派野心家反对社会主义的活动，是早已有准备的阴谋，所以一动起来，有些地方的右派分子也就互相呼应。广东省的右派分子，竭力诬蔑我们在农村工作中的成绩，散播“广东的农业合作化搞坏了”、“广东农民的生活接近饿死的边缘”等谬论。右派分子罗翼群，最近几天还下乡奔走，寻找所谓“农民接近饿死边缘”的材料，到处造谣煽动，专找地主和被管制的反革命分子谈话，不敢和工农劳动人民见面。罗翼群到了他的家乡兴宁县，就引起了五万群众的愤怒，集会游行群起声讨，列举解放后生活改善的无数事例，驳斥他的无耻谰言，结果他只好抱头鼠窜，躲藏起来，要求护送回省。
    广东去年以来的工作，不论在工农业生产、文化教育、肃反等方面都取得巨大成绩。但右派分子竭力抹煞这些成绩，特别集中抹煞我们农村工作的成绩。现在我就以广东农村工作的实际情况来谈一谈。
    广东已由缺粮省份变成有余粮外调的省份
    广东全省农户的百分之九十五已经组织到农业社里来了。由于社会主义经济制度的优越性和依靠了全体社员的艰苦努力，我们一边办社，一边生产，虽在农业社家底单薄、办社经验不足和遭受到严重的自然灾害的情况下，仍取得了农业生产空前的大丰收。去年农副业生产总值达到三十三亿八千五百万元，比前年增长百分之十二点五五。粮食总产量达到二百四十亿斤，比前年增长百分之九点八，比一九四九年增长百分之五十，比解放前产量最高的一九三六年增加百分之四十。第一个五年计划的前三年，每年平均增产粮食十亿斤，而去年一年即增产二十一亿斤。去年全省经济作物总产值也比前年增加百分之十一。全省有百分之七十以上的农业社增产，百分之七十五以上的社员增加收入。千斤县由三个增至六个，千斤社由八百五十个增至三千六百七十个，有两千多个社赶上了上中农的平均收入水平。农业生产的这种大发展在广东是史无前例的。谁都知道，解放前的广东是个缺粮省份，现在不仅做到自给，而且还能外调一部分支援国家建设，解放前大多数农民除杂粮外每人只有二百斤至二百五十斤稻谷的口粮，现在一般都有四百斤左右（连杂粮折谷计入共五百斤），珠江平原水稻产区更达六百斤至七百斤。去年全省农村社会购买力比前年提高百分之十点六八，布匹销售量增加百分之三十五点八七，平均每户增加二丈多，背心增加百分之四十二，毛巾增加百分之三十，糖增加百分之二十三点一六，食油增加百分之十七。只有猪肉的供应减少一些，现正在采取措施改进，估计到年底生猪的社会存量可达到一千万头，那时猪肉的供应量也可以增加了。
    右派分子面对这样的事实，却硬说“农业合作化搞坏了”、“农民生活接近饿死边缘”。右派分子装出悲天悯人的姿态，伪装成“农民利益代表者”，指责我们不关心农民疾苦。但是，广东的农民知道，中国第一个分配土地给农民的工农苏维埃政权，是共产党领导在广东建立的，以后共产党又领导农民坚持了二十余年的革命游击战争。而在那个时候，压迫剥削农民的正是现在这些伪装的农民利益代表者。广东农民知道，解放以后，是共产党领导了农民进行土地改革和农业合作化，领导了农民增加生产，改善生活。单说今年春天，为了争取农业大丰收，全省有十五万八千名干部和解放军官兵直接参加农业劳动，帮助农民积肥、修水利；今年五月，广东各江洪水暴涨，数万干部和解放军官兵同农民一道上堤防洪抢险，战胜了水灾。在与洪水搏斗中，有六位共产党员和三位共青团员献出了自己的生命。广东农民完全懂得，只有共产党才是关心农民疾苦的，才是真正代表农民利益的。右派分子企图挑拨党和农民血肉相连的关系，不但是枉费心机，而且注定会遭到农民的痛击。
    我们热烈欢迎党外人士的善意批评
    右派分子对共产党的恶意攻击，同党外人士善意批评，是根本不同的。我们对于右派分子的进攻，是坚决地给以反击，但对于党外人士的善意批评，却是热诚欢迎的。我们也从不隐讳工作中的缺点和错误。以农业生产来说，我们在合作化高潮中曾经一度出现生产指导上的单一化偏向，抓紧了粮食，忽略了多种经营；在推广先进技术时，不少地区没有结合本地情况，发生过强迫命令作风；合作社的经营管理还不完善，勤俭办社和民主办社的方针贯彻得还不够好，等等。这些缺点和错误，我们检查出来以后，即予改正。在这次整风运动中，不少党外人士向我们提出许多有益的批评和建议，对工作很有帮助，我们很感谢他们的帮助。
    我们懂得，只有不断地揭露和克服工作上的缺点和错误，才能使得我们的事业不断前进，才能保证取得更大的胜利。今年三月二十六日，广东化县兰山乡群众因反对修建麻疯村闹事，县公安局长陈立达下令开枪，造成打死群众五人，打伤九人的惨痛事件。我们立即进行严肃处理，肇事的公安局长判处无期徒刑，其他失职人员分别受到刑事处分或行政处分。这一沉痛的事件，深刻地教育了我们和全体干部，使我们懂得如何正确处理人民内部的矛盾。如海丰县干部在处理该县海梧乡群众冲突事件时，由于采取了正确的说服教育的方法，使即将爆发的械斗得以和解，未致酿成大祸。我们要认真学习毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示，决心在整风运动中深入检查工作上的缺点和错误，进一步密切党与群众的关系，加强人民的团结，改进工作。我们的事业是光辉灿烂的，我们的队伍是广大坚强的，我们社会主义道路是不可动摇的，我们一定要贯彻整风运动，不断学习，努力实践，力求进步；也一定要继续深入反右派分子斗争，和全国人民团结一致共同前进！
