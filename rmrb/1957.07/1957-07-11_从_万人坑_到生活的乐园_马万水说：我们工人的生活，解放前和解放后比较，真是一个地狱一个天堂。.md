From "Mass Grave" to Paradise on Earth
    Ma Wanshui says: Compared to before and after liberation, the lives of us workers are truly like hell and heaven.

    I am a worker at the Longyan Iron Mine, now working as a technician. All the workers in our mine are very angry when we see the reactionary remarks of the right-wing elements in the newspaper. When I came, they asked me to represent all the workers in the mine to protest at this conference.

    First, I will talk about the brief situation of the Longyan Iron Mine. The Longyan Iron Mine has a large amount of ore reserves and high iron content. Everyone says it is a treasure land. In 1917, it was invested and mined by bureaucratic capitalists. During the twenty years until the July 7th Incident in 1937, it never officially started construction. After the July 7th Incident, the Japanese devils, in order to manufacture guns and bullets to attack the Chinese people, captured a lot of workers to mine for them with the method of spending no money or spending less money. Mining was entirely done by manpower, climbing ladders, carrying small baskets, people drilling holes, hand carts, and people loading ore. Not only was it laborious, but there was also no labor protection at all. Workers were often threatened by being crushed to death or falling to death. They mined like this for eight years and took away more than three million tons of ore. However, when they were mining, they only cared about digging ore, digging wherever there was ore, and digging a complete mine into a mess. After the Japanese devils surrendered, when the Kuomintang reactionaries came, they not only did not formally produce in the three years, but also dismantled and sold the equipment left by the Japanese, making a mess. This is the situation before liberation.

    However, after the Communist Party liberated the Zhangjiakou area for the second time in December 1948, in order to industrialize our country, it began restoration work from the day it was taken over. It was officially put into production in 1951 and started basic construction. Since 1951, production conditions have been improved year by year. Workers are picked up and dropped off by car, electric vehicles are used to enter and exit tunnels and pull ore, loading machines are used to load ore, and water-flushing rock drills with pneumatic brackets are used for drilling; workers wear canvas work clothes, high-top rubber shoes, and wicker hats, and are also given bread-style health cod liver oil pills. Due to the improvement of production conditions, coupled with the active labor of our workers, production has increased year by year. Taking our group as an example, since entering the first five-year plan, the production tunneling rate has increased rapidly, with the highest speed reaching 128.5 meters per month (cross-section of 13.8 cubic meters), and production tasks are overfulfilled every year. In 1953, we completed the production task of one year and three months in one year, in 1954, we completed the production task of one year and four and a half months in one year, and in 1955, we completed the production task of one year and nine months in one year. By April 2, 1956, we had completed the production task of the first five-year plan one year, eight months and twenty-eight days ahead of schedule (that is, in three years, three months and two days). Taking our entire mine as an example, if 1951 is counted as 100, 1952 increased by 100%, and by 1954, it increased by more than 200%. The annual production of ore is more than one million tons. You see how fast our production has increased.

    Let’s look at our basic construction, which is also progressing very quickly. The first large adit project of more than 8,000 meters long built by our mine has 5,000 meters officially put into production; the second large adit of 15,900 meters long is also under construction. After the completion of this phase of the project, the output can be increased from more than one million tons per year to three million tons.

    Judging from the production situation of our mine, comparing the short eight years after liberation with the more than thirty years before liberation, it is really a world of difference.

    Let me talk about the living conditions of our workers. Before liberation, Japanese devils and Kuomintang officials did not regard us as human beings. Workers were beaten and scolded by them, could not eat enough, could not dress warmly, lived in earthen kilns and shacks, suffered cruel oppression and exploitation, and lived a dark life. At that time, what was particularly frightening was "death." Workers were worried about being crushed to death in the well, and if they were sick, they had no medicine and waited to die. People died every day. The most people died, 170 people died in one day, some were buried alive while they were still breathing, some families were wiped out, and after death, they were pulled to the "mass grave." Who doesn't feel chills when mentioning "mass grave" now!

    What about after liberation? Our workers became masters. Our lives have also gradually improved with the development of production. The wages of all the workers in our mine have increased year by year, enjoying labor insurance benefits. The state has built more than 93,000 square meters of dormitories for us, and also built canteens, hospitals, bathhouses, clubs, schools, sanatoriums, nurseries, libraries...etc. for us. In a word, we have everything that our workers need. When you go to work, you can see the workers' happy work. After work, you can see the workers living a happy life. Our workers' children are all in elementary school and high school, and many are in middle school, and some have entered university. Taking our group as an example, all 27 people in the group were poor bachelors carrying a mouth on two shoulders before liberation; now what? The average monthly salary of each person is about 100 yuan. Twenty-six of them are married and have established happy families; nine have bought radios; twenty have bought watches; and twenty-seven all have several sets of new clothes.

    Compared to before and after liberation, the lives of us workers are truly like hell and heaven.

    We understand that it is the Communist Party of China and socialism that liberate the workers and seek welfare for the people. We workers resolutely support the Communist Party and resolutely support socialism. We understand that in the old society, imperialists and Chinese bureaucratic capitalists were eating our workers' flesh and drinking our workers' blood. Such a blood feud can never be forgotten. Now, the right-wing elements dare to spread reactionary remarks, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and want to pull us back into hell again. We will never allow it. I warn them that the people of the whole country are awakened people, not people who are ridden on their necks by them. The people's eyes are bright, and the right-wing elements' intentions are clearly seen. I hope they will turn back as soon as possible and honestly correct their mistakes; if they do not correct them, we will resolutely fight them and never stop until we defeat them thoroughly.

    Finally, I shout: Long live the Communist Party! Long live Chairman Mao!

    从“万人坑”到生活的乐园
    马万水说：我们工人的生活，解放前和解放后比较，真是一个地狱一个天堂。
    我是龙烟铁矿的工人，现在做技师工作。我们全矿的工人，看到报纸上右派分子的反动言论，都很气愤。我来的时候，他们叫我代表全矿工人，在这次大会上提出抗议。
    我先谈谈龙烟铁矿的简略情况。龙烟铁矿的矿石埋藏量大、铁质多，谁也说这是一块宝地。一九一七年由官僚资本家投资开采，到一九三七年七七事变这二十年里，始终没有正式开工。七七事变以后，日本鬼子为了制造枪炮子弹来打中国人，他们用不花钱或少花钱的办法，抓了很多的工人来给他们开矿。开矿完全是用人力，爬胡梯、背小筐，人打眼、手推车、人装矿石，不光是费劲，而且根本没有劳动保护，工人们经常受着砸死、摔死的威胁。这样开了八年，共弄走矿石三百多万吨。但是，他们在开矿的时候，只顾挖矿石，那里有那里挖，把一块完整的矿，挖了个乱七八糟。日本鬼子投降，国民党反动派来了以后，他们在三年的时间里，不但没有正式生产，反而把日本留下的设备拆的拆、卖的卖，弄了个一塌糊涂。这就是解放前的情况。
    可是，一九四八年十二月共产党二次解放张家口地区以后，为了我国的工业化，从接收那天起就开始了恢复工作。一九五一年正式投入生产，并开始基本建设。从一九五一年起，生产条件年年改进，工人上下班用汽车接送，进出坑道和拉矿石都用电车，装矿石用装车机，打眼用水湿钻岩机还带风动支架；工人上工有帆布工作服、高腰大胶鞋、柳条帽，还发给面包式的保健鱼肝油丸。由于生产条件的改进，再加上我们工人的积极劳动，生产就年年提高。拿我们小组来说，进入第一个五年计划以来，生产掘进率提高得很快，最高速度达到每月掘进一百二十八点五公尺（断面十三点八立方公尺），年年超额完成生产任务。一九五三年一年完成了一年零三个月的生产任务，一九五四年一年完成了一年零四个半月的生产任务，一九五五年一年完成了一年零九个月的生产任务，到一九五六年四月二日已提前一年零八个月又二十八天的时间（也就是用三年零三个月又两天的时间），完成了第一个五年计划的生产任务。拿我们全矿来说，如果一九五一年算做一百，一九五二年就提高了百分之百，到一九五四年，提高了百分之二百多，每年生产的矿石都在一百万吨以上。你看我们的生产提高得多快。
    再看看我们的基本建设，也是进展得很快。我们矿建设的八千多公尺长的第一大平硐工程，已有五千公尺正式投入生产；建设的一万五千九百公尺长的第二大平硐，也正在施工，这期工程完工后，产量即可由年产一百多万吨增加到三百万吨。
    从我们矿的生产情况来看，解放后短短的八年时间和解放前三十多年的时间比较，真是差到天上地下了。
    我再谈谈我们工人的生活情况。在解放前，日本鬼子和国民党的官员们，都不把我们当人看待，工人挨他们的打，挨他们的骂，吃不饱，穿不暖，住土窑，住窝铺，受尽了残酷的压迫和剥削，过着暗无天日的生活。在那个时候，特别使人害怕的是“死”。工人下井耽心砸死，有病没有医药等死，每天都得死人。死人最多的时候，一天死一百七十人，有的带气就活埋了，有的一家死绝了，死后拉到“万人坑”。提起“万人坑”现在谁不心寒！
    解放后呢？我们工人当了主人。我们的生活也随着生产的发展，逐步的得到了改善。我们全矿的工人，逐年都增加了工资，享受着劳保待遇，国家给我们盖了宿舍九万三千多平方公尺，还给我们建设了食堂、医院、浴池、俱乐部、学校、休养院、托儿所、图书馆……等等。一句话，凡是我们工人需要的，都有了。上班的时候你可以看到工人们的愉快劳动，下班以后，你可以看到工人们过着美满的生活。我们工人的子弟都上了初小和高小，不少的上了中学，有的入了大学。再拿我们小组来说，全组二十七人，解放前都是两个肩膀担着一个嘴的穷光棍；现在呢？每人每月的平均工资都在一百元左右。其中二十六人结了婚，建立了美满的家庭；九个人买了收音机；二十个人买了手表；二十七个人都有几套新衣服。
    我们工人的生活，解放前和解放后比较，真是一个地狱，一个天堂。
    我们懂得，解放工人的、为人民谋福利的是中国共产党，是社会主义，我们工人坚决拥护共产党，坚决拥护社会主义。我们懂得，在旧社会里，帝国主义者和中国的官僚资本家都是吃我们工人的肉、喝我们工人的血的，这样的血海深仇，是永辈子不能忘记的。现在右派分子竟敢散布反动言论，反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义，想把我们重新拉入地狱，我们是坚决不容许的。我警告他们，全国人民是已经觉悟的人民，而不是被他们骑在脖子上的人民了，人民的眼睛是亮的，右派分子打的什么主意，是看得清清楚楚的。希望他们及早回头，老老实实地改正错误；他们如果不改正，我们要和他们坚决的斗争，斗他们不彻底决不收兵。
    最后，我喊：共产党万岁！毛主席万岁！
