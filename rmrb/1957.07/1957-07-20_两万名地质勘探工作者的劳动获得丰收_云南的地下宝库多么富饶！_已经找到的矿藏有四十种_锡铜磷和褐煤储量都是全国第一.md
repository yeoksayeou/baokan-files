Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 18th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Huang Changlu): Twenty thousand geological prospecting workers are spread across the Yunnan Plateau. They have exceeded the state-assigned workload in the first Five-Year Plan, identifying forty types of minerals for the country. Among them, the reserves of tin, copper, phosphorus, and lignite currently rank first in the country.

Yunnan is located in the middle section of the Hengduan Mountains, with towering mountains and complex geological structures, suitable for the formation of various mineral deposits. The Cangshan and Helao Mountains in central Yunnan and the Gaoligong Mountains in western Yunnan have ancient metamorphic rock belts, producing copper, iron, and various rare metals. The eastern Yunnan area has more sedimentary mineral deposits, producing coal, phosphorus, and some building materials. At the junction of old and new strata are polymetallic mineral deposits. Geographically, a large part of Yunnan is subtropical, humid, and rainy, easily forming placer deposits.

Many years ago, some people believed that Yunnan was a region rich in mineral resources, but what exactly were those minerals? What were the reserves? It remained a mystery. Before liberation, there was only one drilling rig in the entire Yunnan province, and a handful of geological personnel conducted some geological surveys in individual mining areas. Many mining areas have had two to three hundred years of mining history, but all were blindly exploited. For example, the nationally renowned Gejiu Tin Mine has been mined for two hundred and fifty years, but there was no formal geological work before liberation, resulting in a large amount of resource damage and waste.

Large-scale geological exploration in Yunnan began in 1953. Veteran Chinese geologists and young geological prospecting personnel came successively from Northeast China, Beijing, Sichuan, and other places to the remote Yunnan Plateau. They spread out a vast geological prospecting network in dozens of counties from the Wumeng Mountains in the east to the Gaoligong Mountains in the west, the Jinsha River in the north, and the Hong River in the south. They reached the "malaria-infested areas" that people used to fear and climbed the steep cliffs that even apes found difficult to traverse. They endured the scorching heat of the tropical summer and overcame the difficulties brought to fieldwork by the long rainy season every year. By the end of last year, the total length of underground tunnels excavated had reached more than 700 li, the total depth drilled into the strata by drilling rigs was 90,000 zhang, and geological surveys of varying degrees of precision had been carried out in an area of more than 10,000 square kilometers.

Geological prospecting is an emerging field in our country. Before liberation, old geologists, due to limited conditions, mostly engaged in academic research on geology and stratigraphy, lacking systematic experience in prospecting procedures and methods. Therefore, many Soviet experts in geology, surveying, hydrology, and other fields came to Yunnan one after another, traversing mountains and rivers, to help our young geological prospecting personnel quickly master all the work from geological survey to prospecting and even laboratory analysis, so that the technical level of the geological prospecting team was rapidly improved.

According to the proven mineral reserves, Yunnan will become one of the important bases of China's non-ferrous metal industry. As one of the main sources of agricultural fertilizer, the preliminary proven reserves of phosphate rock in more than a dozen counties in central Yunnan are more than 2.6 billion tons. A phosphate mine in Kunyang County, on the shore of Dianchi Lake, is the largest phosphate mine in our country. Some people were worried about the prospects of Yunnan's industrial development because it was said that Yunnan was a province poor in coal production. Now, the coal reserves explored in only five places have reached 1.2 billion tons. The Xiaolongtan lignite field, located on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway line, has proven reserves of more than 800 million tons of lignite that can be used to extract petroleum, making it the largest proven lignite field in the country. The coking coalfield explored in Yongren County, on the bank of the Jinsha River in northern Yunnan, is not far from the Panzhihua Iron Mine in Sichuan Province, and will be able to support this steel base in the southwest in the future. In addition, many rare minerals urgently needed for national industrial construction have been discovered or are being explored in Yunnan.

Most of the discovered or proven minerals are buried in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated or mixed communities. Their successive development will provide reliable conditions for rapidly changing the backward economic situation of ethnic minorities.

    两万名地质勘探工作者的劳动获得丰收
    云南的地下宝库多么富饶！
    已经找到的矿藏有四十种  锡铜磷和褐煤储量都是全国第一
    新华社昆明18日电  新华社记者黄昌禄报道：两万名地质勘探工作人员遍布云南高原上，他们已经超额完成了第一个五年计划中国家规定的工作量，为国家找出四十种矿藏；其中锡、铜、磷和褐煤的储量，目前都占全国首位。
    云南位处横断山脉的中段，山岳横亘，地质构造复杂，适合于多种矿床的形成。滇中的苍山、和牢山和滇西的高黎贡山，有古老的变质岩带，出产铜、铁和各种稀有金属；滇东一带多沉积矿床，出产煤、磷和若干建筑材料，在老地层同新地层的交界处是多金属矿的矿床。在地理上，云南很大部分地区属亚热带，潮湿多雨，容易形成砂矿。
    多少年前，有人就认定云南系一矿藏丰硕的地区，但究竟是那些矿？蕴藏量有多少？却一直是个谜。解放前，云南全省只有一台钻探机，寥寥可数的几个地质人员在个别矿区作了一些地质调查工作。不少矿区具有两三百年的开采历史，但都是盲目开采。例如全国闻名的个旧锡矿，从开矿到现在已经有二百五十年，但是解放前始终没有正规的地质工作，造成资源的大量破坏和浪费。
    云南大规模的地质勘探是从1953年开始的。我国的老地质工作者和年轻的地质勘探人员，陆续从东北、北京、四川和其它地方来到遥远的云南高原。他们在东起乌蒙山、西迄高黎贡山、北至金沙江、南达红河的几十个县境，张开一幅庞大的地质勘探网。他们到达了过去人们谈虎色变的“瘴疠之区”，攀登上猿猴也难行走的峭岩绝壁。他们经受了热带夏季炎日的熏炙，战胜了每年一度漫长雨季给野外工作带来的困难。到去年年底，地下开凿的坑道合计就已有七百多里长，钻探机钻进地层的深度加起来共九万丈，在一万多平方公里的面积内进行了不同精确程度的地质调查。
    地质勘探在我国是一项新兴的工作。解放前，老地质学家们由于条件所限，大多从事于地质地层的学术研究，对勘探程序和方法缺乏系统的经验。因此，苏联的地质、测量、水文等各方面专家多人先后来到云南，翻山涉水，帮助我国年轻的地质勘探工作人员们，迅速掌握了从地质调查到勘探以至化验分析的全部工作，使地质勘探队伍的技术水平迅速提高。
    根据已经探明的矿量，云南将成为我国有色金属工业的重要基地之一。作为农业肥料主要来源之一的磷矿，在云南中部十多个县内，初步探明蕴藏量有二十六亿吨以上。位于滇池畔昆阳县内的一个磷矿，是我国储量最大的磷矿。曾经有人为云南工业发展前途耽心，因为据说云南是产煤贫乏的省份。现仅在五个地方勘探出的煤，储量就达十二亿吨。地处滇越铁路线上的小龙潭褐煤田，已探出可以提炼石油的褐煤有八亿多吨，是目前全国已探明的最大褐煤田。在滇北金沙江畔永仁县勘探出的炼焦煤田，距四川省的攀枝花铁矿不远，将来可以支援这个西南的钢铁基地。此外，许多国家工业建设亟需的稀有矿产，已在云南发现或正在勘探。
    已发现或探明的矿产，大部分埋藏在少数民族聚居或杂居地区，它们的陆续开发将为迅速改变少数民族落后经济现状提供可靠条件。
