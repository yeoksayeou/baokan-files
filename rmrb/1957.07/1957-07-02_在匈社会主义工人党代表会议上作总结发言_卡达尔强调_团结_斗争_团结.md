Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 1st: Kadar, in his concluding speech at the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party National Congress on June 29th, said that the atmosphere of the meeting was very good, and frank debates were conducted on matters of principle. Everyone had a completely consistent understanding of the counter-revolutionary events, but there were also some differing opinions regarding the evaluation of the past.

    Kadar said that the working class had made contributions in the struggle to defend the workers' regime. For forty years, the working class has been fighting tenaciously for the socialist revolution and the workers' regime. He also said that close unity between the Party and the armed forces is very necessary in the struggle against the enemy. The Party should first strengthen itself within the working class and the armed forces. If this is done, there is no need to worry about the issue of political power.

    Regarding the issue of relations with non-Party members, Kadar said that among non-Party members, the former members of the Working People's Party are very close to us, and we should establish contact with them to expand our mass base. The People's Republic has a law: except for Party positions, every non-Party member can hold any administrative position, but he should be loyal to the dictatorship of the proletariat and the People's Republic. This principle should take effect in practice.

    Regarding the issue of national unity discussed in the youth movement and literature, Kadar said that we can take the Chinese Communist Party's principle of "unity - struggle - unity" as our own principle. We are currently in the stage of struggle and must draw a clear line between who is on this side of the front and who is on the other.

    Kadar agreed with the comrades who said that economic and cultural work lagged behind other tasks. He pointed out that in order to protect public property, it is necessary to carry out socialist labor emulation campaigns and promote thrift.

    When talking about the workers' councils, Kadar said, I don't think the tendency to abolish the workers' councils is right.

    Kadar also talked about the issue of opposing nationalism. He said that we should take into account Hungary's special environment. For centuries, the Hungarian nation has been oppressed, and glorious national uprisings have played a progressive role. But we have repeatedly overemphasized this special environment one-sidedly, without pointing out that the Hungarian ruling class at that time used the name of the entire nation as an excuse to oppress other people. This is not right. In the struggle against nationalism, this should be seen.

    Kadar finally emphasized that this heated debate was very useful because it clarified some issues.

    在匈社会主义工人党代表会议上作总结发言
    卡达尔强调“团结——斗争——团结”
    据新华社布达佩斯1日电　卡达尔6月29日在匈牙利社会主义工人党全国代表会议上作总结性的发言时说，这次会议的气氛很好，对原则问题都作了坦率的争辩。大家对反革命事件的认识是完全一致的，但是在对过去的评价方面也有一些不同的意见。
    卡达尔说，在保卫工人政权的斗争中，有功劳的是工人阶级。为了社会主义革命和工人政权，工人阶级四十年来都在顽强地斗争着。他又说，在反对敌人的斗争中，党和武装力量的紧密团结是很必要的。党首先应当在工人阶级和武装部队中加强起来。做到了这一点，就不用担心政权问题了。
    谈到同党外人士的关系问题，卡达尔说，在党外人士中，过去的劳动人民党党员同我们很接近，我们应当同他们建立联系来扩展我们的群众基础。人民共和国有一条法律：除了党的职务以外，每个党外人士都可以担任任何行政职务，但是他应当忠于无产阶级专政和人民共和国。这条原则应当在实际当中生效。
    关于在青年运动和文学当中讨论过的全民团结问题，卡达尔说，我们可以拿中国共产党的“团结——斗争——团结”的原则作为自己的原则。我们现在正处在斗争阶段，要划清界限，搞清谁在战线的这方面，谁在另一方面。
    卡达尔对有的同志谈到的经济和文化工作同其他任务相比是落后了的说法，表示同意。他指出，为了保卫公共财产，开展社会主义劳动竞赛和提倡节约是必要的。
    谈到工人委员会的时候，卡达尔说，我不认为取消工人委员会的倾向是对的。
    卡达尔还谈到反对民族主义的问题。他说，我们应当考虑到匈牙利的特殊环境。几世纪以来，匈牙利民族一直受着压迫，光荣的民族起义曾经起了进步的作用。但是我们曾经多次过分地片面强调这种特殊环境，而没有指出当时匈牙利统治阶级以整个民族的名义为借口来压迫其他人民。这是不对的。在反对民族主义的斗争中，应当看到这一点。
    卡达尔最后强调说，这次热烈的辩论非常有用，因为它把一些问题弄清楚了。
