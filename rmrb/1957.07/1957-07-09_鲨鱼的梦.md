　　The Shark's Dream
    Lǐ Xué'áo
It is said that sharks are extremely vicious and love to eat people. In the deep sea, it had a sweet dream. It dreamed that it suddenly grew a thousand scaled claws, stretched towards the shore, gathered all the people, and ate them all up! So, it was elated, intoxicated, staring with its green, shimmering, ring-like eyes, peering at the shore, peering at the people. The tide rose, the sea clamored, surged, and it felt that the best opportunity had come. So, it opened its bloody mouth and pounced towards the shore, like a hungry wolf pouncing on a flock of sheep. The tide receded, the sea gradually calmed down, it never expected that it would be trapped in the shallows, the strong sunlight shone on it, the sharp steel forks pierced it, it jumped and raged, still unwilling to abandon its "sweet" dream!

　　鲨鱼的梦
    李学鳌据说，鲨鱼性情甚恶，最爱吃人。在深深的海底，它作过一个甜蜜的梦。它梦见它突然长出千只鳞爪，伸向海岸，把所有的人都拢来，一一吃尽！于是，它兴高采烈，醉意沉沉，瞪着绿光闪闪环珠大眼，窥视岸边，窥视着人们。涨潮了，海水喧嚣，汹涌，它觉得最好的时机已经来临。于是，张开血盆大口向岸上扑来，像一只饥饿的狼，扑向羊群。潮退了，海面逐渐沉静，它万万没想到啊，它竟被孤困在浅水滩中，强烈的日光射向它，锋利的钢叉刺向它，它暴跳着，狞笑着，仍不肯抛弃它“甜蜜”的梦！
