Xi'an, July 8th (Report from this newspaper) - In the rectification movement, Party organizations in many agencies, enterprises, factories, and schools in the Shaanxi region have actively implemented the spirit of "rectifying and reforming simultaneously," promptly addressing issues raised by the masses, thereby further strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses.

    In the process of addressing issues, attention has generally been paid to promoting democracy and widely soliciting the opinions of the masses. For example, when addressing problems, units such as the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau and the Xi'an Coal Mine Design Institute first had the problem-solving team put forward preliminary opinions, then absorbed some of the masses who had a better understanding of the situation or were more experienced in dealing with certain issues to participate in research and discussion, put forward preliminary plans, submitted them to the leadership for review, and then submitted them to the broad masses for discussion, and finally approved and implemented by the leadership. Due to the importance attached by the leadership and the mass line working methods adopted in handling problems, the problems were resolved relatively quickly, and the masses were also satisfied. For example, the masses at Xi'an Normal College raised more than 240 opinions in the rectification movement, and more than 100 have already been addressed. Employees of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways raised 159 opinions, and Comrade Wang Youming, the Party Secretary, gave classified explanations at the meeting on the issues that had been addressed and those that needed to be reported to higher authorities for resolution.

    At present, many leading personnel and Party member cadres in many units have voluntarily proposed to cancel the excessive care and special treatment they received in the past, and have formulated some necessary systems in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. For example, the four Party member deputy directors of the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau all voluntarily vacated the extra dormitories they occupied and changed their original two spacious offices into one. At the same time, the offices and dormitories of general cadres were also adjusted. The originally planned construction of a 1,200-square-meter building was also cancelled, saving the state more than 100,000 yuan in capital construction funds. The Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways recently approved the requests for demotion and salary reduction voluntarily proposed by three section chief-level and one section head-level Party member cadres. Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory also abolished unreasonable regulations such as cadres above the section level using office hours to study culture and the factory director not having to queue for haircuts. In addition, these units have clearly stipulated a system whereby leading cadres do not take cars for non-official purposes.

    Some units have also given timely solutions to some reasonable demands for living and welfare raised by employees. Last year, the Automobile Repair Factory of the General Logistics Department emphasized caring for the welfare of employees, and the scope of subsidies for employees with difficult living conditions was too wide. This year, in order to emphasize increasing production and practicing economy, subsidies were rarely or not given to some employees with truly difficult living conditions, and corrections have recently been made based on the opinions of the masses.

    Some colleges and universities have made appropriate changes to the methods of assigning graduates and retaining teaching assistants in order to make the graduate assignment work more reasonable. For example, Northwest University decided that before assigning graduates, the departments should first introduce the nature and regions of the assigned jobs to the graduates to prepare the students ideologically. Then, the departments will propose a list of assignments, discuss it at the department affairs meeting, solicit the opinions of teachers, and then the graduate office will sort out and study the preliminary list proposed by each department and submit it to the school leaders for review and approval by the provincial personnel department.

    Because the leading personnel of various units have accepted the opinions of the masses and actively solved some problems, they have eliminated the estrangement between the Party and the masses, creating a new atmosphere in the relationship between the Party and the masses. The masses reflected that the Party's courage to admit mistakes and correct shortcomings made us further realize the greatness of the Party and love the Communist Party even more.

### 右派分子看看整风会不会把党“整垮”  陕西边整边改密切党群关系

    右派分子看看整风会不会把党“整垮”
    陕西边整边改密切党群关系
    本报西安8日电　陕西地区很多机关、企业、工厂和学校的党组织在整风运动中积极贯彻“边整边改”的精神，及时处理群众提出的问题，从而更加密切了党与群众的联系。
    在处理问题过程中，一般都注意了发挥民主，广泛听取群众的意见。如西北纺织管理局、西安煤矿设计院等单位在处理问题时，都是首先由处理问题小组提出初步意见，再吸收一部分了解情况较多或处理某些问题较有经验的群众参加，进行研究讨论，提出初步方案，交领导上审查后，再交广大群众讨论，最后由领导上批准实行。由于领导上的重视和处理问题采取了群众路线的工作方法，问题解决的比较迅速，群众也感到满意。如西安师范学院在整风运动中群众共提出二百四十多条意见，现在已经处理了一百多条。铁道部第六工程局职工提出了一百五十九条意见，党委书记王右铭同志对已经处理和需要请示上级解决的问题在大会上都分类作了交代。
    目前，已经有很多单位的领导人员和党员干部自动提出取消过去给他们的过多照顾和特殊待遇，并根据增产节约的精神规定了一些必要的制度。如西北纺织管理局四个党员副局长都自动将多占的宿舍腾出来，并将原来用的两间宽敞的办公室改为一间，同时还调整了一般干部的办公室和宿舍。原来计划建立的一座一千二百平方公尺的大楼也可以不建了，给国家节省了十万多元的基建资金。铁道部第六工程局最近批准了三个科长级和一个股长级党员干部自觉自愿地提出来的降职降薪的要求。西安农业机械厂也取消了科级以上干部利用办公时间学习文化和厂长理发不排队等不合理的规定。另外，这些单位都明确规定了领导干部非因公不坐汽车的制度。
    有些单位对职工提出的一些合理的生活福利要求也给以及时的解决。总后勤部汽车修理厂去年强调关心职工福利时对职工生活困难补助面过宽，今年为了强调增产节约，对一些生活确实困难的职工又很少或没有补助，最近也根据群众的意见作了纠正。
    有些高等学校为了使毕业生分配工作做的更加合理，对毕业生分配工作和留助教等办法作了适当的变更。如西北大学决定分配毕业生以前，首先由系里向毕业生介绍分配的工作性质、地区，使学生思想上有所准备，然后由系里提出分配名单，在系务会议上进行讨论，征求教师们的意见，再由毕业生办公室将各系提出的初步名单整理研究，送学校领导上审核和省的人事部门批准。
    由于各单位的领导人员接受了群众的意见，积极解决了一些问题，消除了党和群众之间的隔阂，使党群关系上出现了新的气象。群众反映党这样勇于承认错误和改正缺点，使我们更进一步认识到党的伟大，更加热爱共产党。
