I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and other reports submitted to the Congress.

Vice Chairman Guo Moruo's speech at the Congress refuted the anti-socialist scientific program put forward by bourgeois rightists. I fully agree with this speech. I believe that the vast majority of natural scientists and social scientists in our country will, as Vice Chairman Guo Moruo said, unite more closely around the Party and the government through the resolute struggle against the rightists, and work better to serve the socialist cause.

Opening the Way for the Restoration of Bourgeois Social Science is Opening the Way for the Restoration of Capitalism

Socialism has opened up a truly broad path for our country's scientific endeavors. Both natural sciences and social sciences have been given the possibility of unprecedented smooth development. Our country uses great strength to promote and organize natural science research work, because the foundation of natural science left over from old China was very weak. If we do not catch up quickly, we will not be able to adapt to the national construction cause that is developing rapidly. The state's funding for scientific undertakings is mostly used in natural sciences; the training of professional cadres for scientific work is also mostly in natural sciences. All of this is necessary. But of course, this does not mean that the state does not value social sciences. The Marxist-Leninist theory of social history is the guiding principle of all our national work, and our country is carrying out a massive work of educating the people with Marxism. It is not in accordance with the facts to think that we despise social sciences.

Some rightists have come forward to maliciously criticize us for despising social sciences. What evidence do they have? The evidence is that bourgeois social science is no longer popular in the new China of the people. It turns out that what they want to value social science is actually to value bourgeois social science; it turns out that they are attempting to restore bourgeois social science under the guise of valuing social science. The opinion paper put forward in the name of the Science Planning Group of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, the central proposition in the social sciences is to "restore" bourgeois social science. This is an important issue. In the entire reactionary program of the Zhang-Luo alliance, this is one of the most important contents. Opening the way for the restoration of bourgeois social science is opening the way for the restoration of capitalism. I would like to express some opinions on this issue here.

Bourgeois Social Science was Bankrupt in the Era of Old China

Western bourgeois social science, that is, bourgeois socio-political doctrines, after being introduced into China, were once used to oppose feudal ideas in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and played a certain progressive role. However, as Chairman Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy," "Because of the weakness of the Chinese bourgeoisie and the world having entered the era of imperialism, this bourgeois ideology can only fight a few rounds and is defeated by the reactionary alliance of foreign imperialist enslavement ideology and Chinese feudalist restoration ideology."

In old China before the national liberation, although bourgeois social science was taught in schools and many books on bourgeois social science were published in bookstores, the various theories put forward by bourgeois social scientists could only be appreciated by a small group of people. Why were the broad masses of the people not interested in these theories? Part of this theory openly and directly cheered for the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, which of course could only arouse strong resentment from the masses; and another part, although seemingly seeking a new way out for the Chinese nation, only used some reformist empty talk to blur people's understanding of reality, and in fact still acted as apologists for reactionary rule in another form. At that time, the most realistic issue that the broad masses of the people were most concerned about was what the way out for China was. Whether or not a correct answer can be given to this question is the criterion for evaluating various socio-political doctrines. Bourgeois social science cannot answer this question. On this issue, bourgeois social science has long declared its complete bankruptcy. Is this not a fact?

On the Eve of National Liberation, Bourgeois Social Scientists Still Attempted to Use Reformist Proposals to Confront the Revolution

Here I would like to mention the situation on the eve of national liberation. At that time, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was on the verge of collapse, and the complete victory of the people's great revolution was in sight. But at this time, many bourgeois social scientists were still propagating the middle road, the third road, and still attempting to use reformist proposals to confront the revolution, vainly attempting to allow the reactionary ruling forces, which were destined to perish, to prolong their lives. Not to mention the political essays they published at that time, even some works with academic qualities contained this content. At that time, the "Observation Series" edited by Chu Anping bought this kind of work. In this series, Mr. Fei Xiaotong's book "Reconstruction of Rural Society" (published in 1948) is a clear example. In this book, it seems to advocate the abolition of feudal land ownership and advocate "land to the tiller," but the author is by no means planning for the interests of the peasants. He clearly stated: "My statement is entirely based on the survival interests of the landlord class." What he is interested in is not the liberation of the masses of the people, but how to find a "reasonable way out" for the "landlord class." He believes that the great storm of revolution is coming, "this is the key to the survival of the landlord class"; in this situation, the smartest way for the landlord class is to "automatically give up land rent" in exchange for "developing industry." In other words, the landlord class should transform themselves into capitalists, and shift from land exploitation to capital exploitation. According to him, "a government that serves the people" should implement this policy. In the eyes of such bourgeois social scientists, the exploiters should always be exploiters; in their view, it would be most "unreasonable" if, after the feudal land relations are eliminated, landlords were to find a way out in labor. This is something they have never thought of. At that time, a wave of land revolution had already been set off in the liberated areas. In Fei Xiaotong's book, he even used the resistance of the landlords to threaten the revolution. He said: "To implement land to the tiller, there must be a condition, that is, the landlords who originally lived on land rent must find another economic basis. ... They will not easily give up the land. If the landlord class is not given an economic way out, the resolution of the land problem cannot avoid violent factors." These are the conclusions reached by a bourgeois social scientist on such a major issue that relates to the fate of hundreds of millions of working people and also relates to the fate of the Chinese nation. Is it unreasonable for such social science to be spurned by the masses of the people?

Perhaps some people say that although bourgeois social science cannot solve the entire Chinese problem, it can still put forward valuable conclusions on individual issues, such as the population problem. Chinese bourgeois sociologists have indeed written many books on the population problem, which, in addition to retelling the theories of European and American bourgeoisie, also talk about China's population problem. But what conclusions did they get? In a university textbook "The Population Problem" published in 1934, the final conclusion is: "In order to recover the four provinces, our country must have military preparations, which is undoubtedly; but the more fundamental problem is probably not military preparations but the reduction of population. ... At present, the territory is shrinking day by day, and foreign troubles are becoming more and more urgent. We should reduce the size of the population and improve the knowledge of the people, and then we can implement the work of consolidating national defense." At that time, Japanese aggressors had not only occupied the "four northeastern provinces," but had also penetrated into North China. However, according to this social scientist, it is necessary to first reduce the size of the population in order to repel the invaders! Anyone with sound common sense cannot say such a thing, but this is actually what a famous bourgeois social scientist wrote in a grand book!

Bourgeois Social Science is Fundamentally Unscientific

In the so-called social sciences of the bourgeoisie, such nonsense is endless. Some social scientists in the Zhang-Luo alliance said very unhappily: "Some people think that there is no science to speak of in bourgeois society, because those things that were called 'social sciences' in the past are unscientific." In fact, bourgeois social science is not only unscientific, but also fundamentally anti-scientific. Scholars standing on the bourgeois position can never see the most fundamental factors that determine historical development in the complex and diverse relationships of social life, and can never truthfully examine the development history of class struggle and recognize the decisive role of the working people in history. Their so-called social science is, in essence, nothing more than putting a scientific disguise on some lies in order to safeguard the interests of the exploiting classes, and using them to oppose the true social science - the proletariat's Marxist-Leninist social science.

Should such social science be valued? Should it be "restored"? After reading the various conclusions in bourgeois social science that confuse right and wrong and reverse black and white, we will all feel that the common sense of ordinary workers and peasants is much more valuable than it.

As everyone knows, before national liberation, China did not only have bourgeois social science. Marxist-Leninist social science had already developed along with the people's revolutionary struggle led by the proletariat. Indeed, before liberation, bourgeois social science occupied a dominant position in the ideological circles, because it could adapt to or at least not violate the interests of the rulers of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and received their direct and indirect support. Although Marxist social science was in a state of oppression for a long time, it relied on its scientific nature and revolutionary nature to continuously wage struggles against bourgeois social science, which occupied the dominant position. As early as before national liberation, bourgeois social science had already exposed its bankruptcy in theory and practice. Now that the Chinese people have not only won the victory of the people's democratic revolution, but also won the victory of the socialist revolution, the foundation on which bourgeois social science relies, the capitalist system, has gone forever in China. At this time, wanting to "restore" bourgeois social science, isn't it a little too late?

Rightists Do Their Best to Attack Marxism and the State's Laws and Policies in Order to Restore the Capitalist System

Obviously, the rightists themselves can see that it is not an easy thing to restore bourgeois social science now. The opinion paper on scientific issues put forward under the command of the Zhang-Luo alliance said, "What should be restored should be restored immediately by taking appropriate steps, and what should be valued should be valued." What "appropriate steps" do they want to take? It seems that there are the following three basic steps:

First, attack Marxism. If the prestige of Marxist theory is not undermined, the restoration of bourgeois theory is of course hopeless. Therefore, they try their best to attack Marxism in the name of opposing dogmatism. They say that Marxism is dogmatism, something that stagnates and does not advance after it is formed.

Second, demand that the state formulate policies and laws based on the opinions of bourgeois social scientists. Since Marxism is dogmatism, then the policies and laws formulated under the guidance of Marxism are of course contrary to science. Therefore, the above-mentioned opinion paper said: "Another deviation in the social sciences is that policies and measures or government laws and regulations are often regarded as objective laws." In order to correct this "deviation," the government can only ask bourgeois social scientists for advice. The opinion paper said: "We believe that social science researchers should be encouraged to pay attention to investigation and research work, and provide opinions on the government's policies and laws in the spirit of seeking truth from facts."

As everyone can see, the first step mentioned above has been actively carried out by many rightists in the recent period. The second step has also been advocated by many rightists. Wang Zaoshi, a rightist in Shanghai, said this most clearly. He taught the Party and the government: "Seriously listen to and adopt the results of expert research. Many problems cannot be solved by common sense, let alone by dogma. ... Not only in the natural sciences, but especially in the social sciences (such as political science, including administrative management, law, economics, sociology, etc.) how to recruit our experienced scholars, entrust them to realistically contact the actual situation of various departments, research and provide programs for adoption."

If these two steps are achieved, then the third step, the restoration of the capitalist system, will of course follow. If state affairs are handled under the guidance of bourgeois social science, what will the result be if not the restoration of the capitalist system? Once the capitalist system is restored, it is of course no problem for bourgeois social science to restore its former dominant position.

Therefore, the "restoration" of bourgeois social science is not just a problem in the academic circles. Bourgeois social science is the superstructure of the capitalist system, and it also serves the capitalist system. Using bourgeois social science to negate Marxism is an attempt to use the capitalist system to negate the socialist system; striving for the ideological dominance of bourgeois social science is an attempt to win political dominance for the bourgeoisie. For this reason, the restoration of bourgeois social science has become one of the important programs of the rightist groups that oppose socialism.

Our Attitude Towards Bourgeois Social Science is Not Simply to Abolish it, But We Must Negate it in Principle.

Perhaps some people will say that although the opinion paper put forward by the science group of the China Democratic League advocates the restoration of bourgeois social science, it also recognizes transformation. The opinion paper said: "The old social science should be transformed rather than abolished." But it should be seen that since we want to "restore" and also "transform," what kind of transformation is this? The Chinese society has experienced such a huge change. People who attempt to "restore" bourgeois social science also know that it is impossible to simply move out their set of things as they were, so there must be a little bit of "remodeling." But since it is to restore bourgeois social science, then no matter how much it is embellished and what "transformation" is done, such as adding a little bit of socialist words, bourgeois social science is still bourgeois social science, and the essence has not changed.

Marxists do not advocate simply abolishing bourgeois social science. But we must negate it in principle. Standing on the Marxist position, after negating bourgeois social science in principle, we can then critically absorb various knowledge materials that are useful to us from it. Bourgeois social science is fundamentally anti-scientific, but it has accumulated a lot of knowledge materials in it. We can and should regard them as the heritage of human culture, and adopt and utilize them. People who have studied bourgeois social science, after ideological transformation and establishing a Marxist position, many of the knowledge they have accumulated in the past can in turn play an active role in promoting Marxist scientific research work. Facts have proved that the more people who can thoroughly negate bourgeois social science from the bottom up with Marxism, the more they can absorb some useful things from bourgeois social science. The rightists say that our negation of bourgeois social science is to completely write off bourgeois social science and completely negate all the knowledge of bourgeois social scientists. This is a malicious distortion.

We Advocate Free Debate to Distinguish Right from Wrong, While Rightists Try to Control Scientific Undertakings with Bourgeois Ideas.

"Don't you advocate letting a hundred flowers bloom?" - Yes, we will still advocate using the method of letting a hundred flowers bloom to carry out scientific research work in the future. We do not think that people can only have the right to speak on academic issues after they have completely completed ideological transformation. In discussing various academic issues in the social sciences, many people often reveal, and even adhere to, the old bourgeois views. This situation is understandable. We advocate that Marxism and various bourgeois viewpoints should freely engage in debates on academic issues, so as to truly distinguish right from wrong and solve problems ideologically. Doing so is good for exercising Marxism, good for eliminating the influence of bourgeois ideology in the social sciences, good for promoting the ideological transformation of intellectuals, and good for strengthening the leading position of Marxism-Leninism in the entire national life.

Rightists who advocate "restoring" bourgeois social science do not really welcome the method of letting a hundred flowers bloom. Because they clearly know that in free debate, unscientific and anti-scientific things cannot stand. The scientific work program they put forward is not a program for developing scientific work, but a program for controlling scientific undertakings with bourgeois ideas. In the social sciences they talk about, there is no place for Marxism. They want to make natural science separate from the leadership of the Party and separate from the leadership of Marxism, in order to use the bourgeois worldview and bourgeois socio-political views to capture natural scientists. They demand that bourgeois social science be only accepted, not criticized. For this reason, they hope to create a socio-political condition in which bourgeois social science has the freedom to publish any nonsense, while Marxism does not have the freedom to criticize bourgeois social science. Of course, under the socialist system, there will never be such socio-political conditions; to create such conditions, there is only the restoration of capitalism.

Before us is a huge struggle. This is a struggle between wanting capitalism or socialism, a struggle between wanting bourgeois socio-political doctrines or Marxism-Leninism to guide our national life. The ugly true faces of the rightist politicians and scholars have been nakedly exposed in front of the people of the whole country, but this struggle has not ended but only begun. To thoroughly win the victory on the ideological front, we still need to carry out a lot of work in depth. Marxist social science researchers of course cannot abandon their responsibilities. They should actively stand up to fight to crush the bourgeois social science restoration conspiracy and the capitalist restoration conspiracy, and should closely unite with the vast majority of natural scientists who support socialism in this struggle. They should also help many people who once stood on the position of bourgeois social science to continue ideological transformation, and mobilize them to jointly carry out this struggle.

### 绝不允许资产阶级社会科学复辟  胡绳的发言

专栏：

    绝不允许资产阶级社会科学复辟
    胡绳的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和提交大会的其他各项报告。
    郭沫若副委员长在大会上的发言驳斥了资产阶级右派分子所提出的一个反社会主义的科学工作纲领。我完全同意这个发言。我相信，我国绝大多数自然科学家和社会科学家都会像郭沫若副委员长所说的，在对右派分子进行坚决斗争中，更紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，更好地为服务于社会主义事业而努力。
    为资产阶级社会科学打开复辟道路也就是为资本主义打开复辟道路
    社会主义为我国的科学事业开辟了真正宽广的道路。无论自然科学还是社会科学都得到了从未有过的顺利发展的可能。我们的国家用很大的力量来推动和组织自然科学的研究工作，这是因为旧中国留下来的自然科学底子很薄弱，如果不急起直追，就不能适应一日千里地向前发展的国家建设事业。国家用于科学事业的经费，较多地用在自然科学方面；培养科学工作的专业干部，也以自然科学方面的较多，这都是必要的。但是这当然并不表示国家不重视社会科学。马克思列宁主义的社会历史理论是我们的一切国家工作的指导原则，我们的国家进行着用马克思主义教育人民群众的巨大规模的工作。认为我们轻视社会科学是与事实不符的。
    有些右派分子站出来恶意地批评我们轻视社会科学，他们有什么证据呢？证据是：资产阶级社会科学在人民的新中国已经吃不开了。原来他们要求重视社会科学，其实是要求重视资产阶级社会科学，原来他们是在重视社会科学的叫嚣下面企图使资产阶级的社会科学复辟。以民盟中央科学规划问题小组的名义提出来的意见书，在社会科学方面的中心主张就是要“恢复”资产阶级社会科学。这是一个重要的问题。在章罗同盟的全部反动纲领中，这一点是极重要的内容之一。为资产阶级社会科学打开复辟的道路也就是为资本主义打开复辟的道路。我想在这里就这个问题说一点意见。
    资产阶级社会科学在旧中国时代即已破产
    西方的资产阶级社会科学，即资产阶级的社会政治学说，输入中国后，曾经在十九世纪末年和二十世纪初年，被用来反对封建思想，起了一定的进步作用。但是，正像毛泽东主席在“新民主主义论”中所说的，“因为中国资产阶级的无力和世界已经进到帝国主义时代，这种资产阶级思想只能上阵打几个回合，就被外国帝国主义的奴化思想和中国封建主义的复古思想的反动同盟所打退了。”
    在全国解放以前的旧中国，虽然学校里讲的是资产阶级社会科学，书店里也出了很多资产阶级社会科学的书，但是资产阶级社会科学家提出的种种学说始终只能在一小群人中间受到欣赏。为什么广大群众对于这些学说不感兴趣呢？这种学说中，有一部分是公开地、直接地为帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治做啦啦队，当然只能引起群众的强烈反感；而另外一部分，虽然好像是要为中国民族寻求新的出路，但也只是用一些改良主义的空谈来模糊人们对于现实的认识，其实也还是在另一种形式下为反动统治当辩护士。在当时，中国的出路到底是什么，是广大群众所最关心的现实问题。能不能对这个问题作出正确的解答，是评价各种社会政治学说的标准。资产阶级社会科学解答不了这个问题。在这个问题上资产阶级社会科学早已宣告了它的彻底破产，这难道不是事实么？
    全国解放前夕，资产阶级社会科学家仍图用改良主义的主张来对抗革命
    在这里我想提一下在全国解放前夕的情形。那时国民党反动统治崩溃在即，人民大革命的彻底胜利在望。但是就在这个时候，不少资产阶级社会科学家却仍旧在宣传着中间道路，第三条道路，仍旧企图用改良主义的主张来对抗革命，妄想使注定要灭亡的反动统治势力苟延残喘。当时他们发表的政论文章不用说了，就是一些带有学术性质的作品中间也包含着这种内容。当时储安平主编的“观察丛书”所收买的就是这一类作品。在这套丛书中有费孝通先生著“乡土重建”（1948年出版）就是明显的例子。在这本书里，看起来好像是主张取消封建的土地所有制，主张“耕者有其田”，但是作者决不是为农民的利益打算。他明白地说：“我这种说法完全是站在地主阶层的生存兴趣上立论的”。他所感到兴趣的并不是人民大众的解放，而是怎样为“地主阶层”找寻“合理的出路”。他认为，革命的大风暴来了，“这是地主阶层生死关键所在”；在这种情形下，地主阶层最聪敏的办法是“自动放弃地租”，而以“开拓工业”为交换条件，换句话说，就是要地主摇身一变而为资本家，从土地剥削转到资本剥削上去。据他说，“一个为人民服务的政府”就应当实行这种政策。在这种资产阶级社会科学家看来，剥削者应当永远是剥削者；如果在消灭封建土地关系后，要地主在劳动中找寻出路，在他们看来，是最不“合理”的了，这是他们从来没有想到过的事。当时在解放区内，已经掀起了土地革命的浪潮，在费孝通这本书里居然用地主的反抗来威胁革命，他说：“实行耕者有其田，必须有一个条件，就是本来靠地租维持生活的地主得另外找一个经济的基础。……他们是不会轻易放弃土地的。如果不给地主阶层一个经济的出路，土地问题的解决过程中避免不了暴力的因素。”——这些就是一个资产阶级社会科学家在关系到几万万劳动人民的命运，也关系到中国民族命运的土地问题这样重大的问题上达到的结论。这样的社会科学要受到人民大众的唾弃，难道有什么不合理么？
    或许有人说，资产阶级的社会科学虽然不能解决整个中国问题，但在个别问题上还能够提出有价值的结论，例如人口问题。中国资产阶级的社会学家的确写了不少关于人口问题的书，其中除了转述欧美资产阶级的理论以外，也谈到中国的人口问题。但他们究竟得到些什么结论呢？在一本一九三四年出版的“人口问题”大学教科书中，最后结论说：“为求四省的恢复，我国必需有军事的准备，这是无疑的；但比较根本的问题恐怕还不是军备而是人口的减缩。……目下国土日蹙，外患日急，我们应该减少人口的数量，提高人民的知识，然后可以实行巩固国防的工作”。当时日本侵略者已经不仅侵占了“东北四省”，而且已经深入华北，可是据这个社会科学家的说法，必须首先减少人口的数量，才能打退侵略者！任何人依靠健全的常识都不能说出这种话来，可是这居然是一个有名的资产阶级社会科学家写在堂堂皇皇的大书上的话！
    资产阶级社会科学从根本上说来是反科学的
    在资产阶级的所谓社会科学中间，这类胡言乱语是举不胜举的。章罗同盟中的一些社会科学家很不高兴地说：“有人认为，资产阶级社会里没有科学可言，因为那些过去被称为‘社会科学’的东西都是不科学的。”其实，资产阶级的社会科学还不仅是不科学的，而且在根本上说来，是反科学的。站在资产阶级立场上的学者从来不能在社会生活的复杂多样的关系中看到决定历史发展的最根本的因素，从来不能实事求是地考察阶级斗争的发展历史而承认劳动人民在历史上的决定作用。他们的所谓社会科学，在根本上说来，不过是为了维护剥削阶级的利益而把一些谎话加上了科学的伪装，用以反对真正的社会科学——无产阶级的马克思列宁主义的社会科学。
    这样的社会科书难道应当受到重视？应当“恢复”么？看了资产阶级社会科学中的种种混淆是非，颠倒黑白的结论，我们都会感到，普通的工人农民的常识也要比它有价值得多。
    大家知道，在全国解放以前，中国并不是只有资产阶级的社会科学。马克思列宁主义的社会科学早已随着无产阶级领导的人民革命斗争而发展起来了。的确，在解放以前，资产阶级社会科学是在思想界中居于统治的地位，那是因为它能适应或至少不违反帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治者的利益，受到他们直接间接的支持的原故。马克思主义社会科学虽然长期处于被压迫的地位，但是依靠了它的科学性和革命性，不断地同居于统治地位的资产阶级社会科学进行了斗争。早在全国解放以前，资产阶级社会科学已经暴露了它在理论和实践上的破产。到了现在，中国人民不但已经取得了人民民主革命的胜利，而且已经取得了社会主义革命的胜利，资产阶级社会科学所依靠的基础，资本主义制度，在中国已经一去而不可复返，在这个时候，还想把资产阶级社会科学“恢复”起来，岂不是太晚一点了么？
    右派分子极力攻击马克思主义和国家的法令政策，以便使资本主义制度复辟
    显然，右派分子自己也看得出来，现在要来恢复资产阶级社会科学不是很容易的事情。在章罗同盟指挥下提出来的关于科学问题的意见书中说，“应当恢复的应即采取适当步骤予以恢复，应当重视的就应重视起来。”他们究竟要采取些什么“适当步骤”呢？看来有下列三个基本步骤：
    第一，攻击马克思主义。如果不破坏马克思主义理论的威信，资产阶级理论的复辟当然是没有希望的。所以他们尽力在反对教条主义的名义下攻击马克思主义，他们把马克思主义说成就是教条主义，说成是一经形成以后就停滞不进的东西。
    第二，要求国家根据资产阶级社会科学家的意见来制订政策法令。既然马克思主义就是教条主义，那么在马克思主义指导下制定的政策法令当然都是违反科学的了。所以上述意见书中说：“在社会科学方面的另一偏向是往往把政策措施或政府法令当成客观规律”。为了纠正这个“偏向”，政府当然只好向资产阶级社会科学家请教了。意见书中说：“我们认为应该鼓励社会科学研究工作者重视调查研究工作，根据实事求是的精神，对政府的政策法令提供意见”。
    大家看到，上述的第一个步骤，最近期间，已经有许多右派分子在积极地进行着了。这第二个步骤，也有许多右派分子在鼓吹着了。上海有个右派分子王造时，对这点说得最明确。他教训党和政府说：“认真听取并采用专家研究的成果。许多问题不是凭常识，更不是凭教条能解决的。……不但在自然科学方面，尤其在社会科学方面（例如政治学，包括行政管理学、法律学、经济学、社会学等等）如何延揽我们的老成学者，委托他们切实联系各部门的实际，研究并提供方案，以备采纳。”
    如果这两个步骤做到了，那么接着当然就来了第三个步骤，资本主义制度的复辟。国家的事情都在资产阶级社会科学的指导下办理，结果不是资本主义制度的复辟是什么呢？一旦资本主义制度复了辟，资产阶级社会科学恢复它的从前的统治地位当然是不成问题的了。
    所以资产阶级社会科学的“恢复”并不只是学术界中的问题。资产阶级社会科学是资本主义制度的上层建筑物，也是为资本主义制度服务的。用资产阶级社会科学来否定马克思主义，就是企图用资本主义制度来否定社会主义制度；为资产阶级社会科学争取思想上的统治地位，就是企图为资产阶级争取政治上的统治地位。就因为这样，恢复资产阶级社会科学这一点就成为反对社会主义的右派集团的重要纲领之一了。
    我们对待资产阶级社会科学的态度不是简单地取消，但一定要在原则上加以否定。
    也许有人说，在民盟科学小组提出的意见书中虽然主张恢复资产阶级社会科学，但同时也承认改造。意见书中说：“对待旧社会科学应当是改造而不是取消”。但是应当看到，既要“恢复”，又要“改造”，这是什么改造呢？中国社会已经经历了这样巨大的变化，企图“恢复”资产阶级社会科学的人也知道，如果完全照原样地把他们那一套搬出来是无论如何不行的了，所以必须多少有一点“改头换面”。但是既然是恢复资产阶级的社会科学，那么尽管涂脂抹粉，做了些什么“改造”，例如加上一点社会主义之类的字眼，资产阶级社会科学还是资产阶级社会科学，实质上是并没有改变的。
    马克思主义者并不主张简单地取消资产阶级社会科学。但我们一定要在原则上加以否定。站在马克思主义立场上，从原则上否定了资产阶级社会科学以后，我们才能够从它里面批判地吸取各种对我们有用的知识材料。资产阶级社会科学在根本上是反科学的，但是在它里面积累了许多知识材料，我们可以而且应当把它们看作人类文化的遗产，加以采择和利用。学过资产阶级社会科学的人，经过思想改造，确立了马克思主义立场以后，他们过去所累积的许多知识也能够反过来，对于推进马克思主义的科学研究工作起积极的作用。事实证明，愈是能够用马克思主义来彻底地从根本上否定资产阶级社会科学的人，就愈是能从资产阶级社会科学中吸取某些有用的东西。右派分子说，我们否定资产阶级社会科学，就是把资产阶级社会科学一笔勾消，把资产阶级社会科学家的一切知识全部否定，这是一种恶意的歪曲。
    我们主张自由争论达到明辨是非，而右派分子则力图用资产阶级思想来控制科学事业
    “你们不是主张百家争鸣么？”——是的，我们今后仍然主张用百家争鸣的方法来开展科学研究工作。我们并不认为，人们只有在彻底完成了思想改造以后才能够在学术问题上有发言权。在讨论社会科学上的各种学术问题时有许多人常常会流露出，甚至还坚持资产阶级的旧的观点，这种情形是可以理解的。我们主张在学术问题上应当让马克思主义和各种资产阶级观点自由地展开争论，以便真正辩明是非，从思想上解决问题。这样做，对于锻炼马克思主义是有好处的，对于清除资产阶级思想在社会科学上的影响也是有好处的；对于推进知识分子的思想改造是有好处的，对于加强马克思列宁主义在整个国家生活中的领导地位也是有好处的。
    主张“恢复”资产阶级社会科学的右派分子其实并不真正欢迎百家争鸣的办法。因为他们明明知道，在自由论争中，非科学的，反科学的东西是站不住脚的。他们所提出的科学工作纲领并不是发展科学工作的纲领，而是用资产阶级思想来控制科学事业的纲领。在他们所说的社会科学中，是没有马克思主义的地位的。他们要使自然科学脱离党的领导，脱离马克思主义的领导，为的就是要用资产阶级的世界观和资产阶级的社会政治观点来俘虏自然科学家。他们要求做到对于资产阶级社会科学只有接受，没有批判，为此他们就希望造成一种社会政治条件，在这种条件下，资产阶级社会科学有发表任何胡言乱语的自由，而马克思主义则没有批判资产阶级社会科学的自由。当然，在社会主义制度下，是决不会有这样的社会政治条件的；要创造这种条件，就只有资本主义的复辟。
    在我们面前是一场巨大的斗争。这是要资本主义还是要社会主义的斗争，这是要由资产阶级社会政治学说还是由马克思列宁主义来指导我们的国家生活的斗争。右派分子的政客和学者们的丑恶的真面目都已经在全国人民的面前赤裸裸地揭开了，但是这场斗争并没有结束而只是开始。在思想战线上要彻底取得胜利还需要我们深入地进行许多工作。马克思主义的社会科学研究工作者当然不能放弃自己的职责，应当积极地起来为粉碎资产阶级社会科学复辟阴谋和资本主义复辟阴谋而斗争，并且应当在这场斗争中和拥护社会主义的绝大多数自然科学家亲密地团结起来，也应当帮助许多曾经站在资产阶级社会科学立场上的人继续进行思想改造，动员他们共同来进行这场斗争。
