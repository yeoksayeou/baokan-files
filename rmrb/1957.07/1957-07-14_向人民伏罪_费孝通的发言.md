Kneeling Before the People to Confess Guilt
Fei Xiaotong's Speech

I kneel before the people to confess my guilt, continuing to expose my crimes, which is also to bear witness to the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo Alliance.

	1. In the second half of 1955, I worked in the Culture and Education Committee of the China Democratic League. In order to discover problems among intellectuals, I advocated organizing various small-scale forums, inviting League members and intellectuals connected to them who harbored dissatisfaction with the Party and socialism to speak their minds freely and express their grievances, adopting anonymous and non-critical working methods. Although this work reflected some of the darker aspects of intellectuals and had certain reference value, the harm it caused was extremely serious: ① It encouraged backward and reactionary ideas to surface, grow, and spread within the organization without criticism. ② It influenced middle-of-the-road elements. ③ It rarely invited progressive elements to participate, isolating and alienating progressive forces. ④ Instead of conducting work through regular organizational life, it adopted a method of directly selecting names freely by leading comrades and holding forums, giving ambitious elements an opportunity to use legitimate organizations to collude with backward elements and engage in conspiratorial activities. ⑤ It collected backward and reactionary opinions as a basis for a one-sided assessment of the situation of intellectuals, creating illusions within the League's leadership and providing the propaganda material needed by ambitious elements, stirring up their attempt to use these intellectuals as their political capital.

	During the start and progress of this work, I repeatedly reported to and sought instructions from meetings controlled by Zhang and Luo in the League Central Committee, receiving their approval and support. They even personally participated in such collusive activities. In the one to two months before the convening of the 1956 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), they instructed that this work be promoted as an experience to local organizations. In this work, I actually implemented the Zhang-Luo Alliance's policy of "uniting with the backward, winning over the middle, and attacking the progressive," and designed working methods to implement this policy.

	2. At the end of 1955, I went to Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou to inspect and understand the problems of intellectuals, promoting the above-mentioned collusive activities to the League organizations in these places, which had a negative impact.

	3. During the 1956 CPPCC, I provided materials and opinions for Luo Longji's speech that provoked discord between the Party and intellectuals.

	4. Zhang and Luo designated me to participate in drafting the work report of the China Democratic League's Second National Congress. Although this report underwent many revisions, I supported several points that were later exploited by right-wing elements at the time: ① First, "developing potential" was listed as the League's main task, which meant improving professional skills and doing a good job in one's position, while "raising awareness," i.e., ideological transformation, was relegated to a secondary position. ② Contacting the masses was put forward as a task, and emphasis was placed on contacting backward elements. ③ It affirmed the practice of leading comrades at all levels personally participating in collusive visits to League members and intellectuals connected to the League. ④ It criticized the failure to adequately represent the legitimate interests and demands of League members and the masses connected to the League, and to offer opinions and suggestions. Under Zhang and Luo's interpretation, the above points became replacing political study with professional study, absorbing backward elements to expand influence, conducting organizational activities through collusion from top to bottom, and representing backward demands to attack the Party. These were written under the direction and influence of Zhang and Luo, subtly infiltrating the Zhang-Luo's reactionary policy into the official documents of the China Democratic League, serving their conspiracy.

	5. After the League's National Congress, I went to the Southwest to participate in minority nationality survey work. The State Council's Expert Bureau asked me to take the opportunity to understand the implementation of the intellectual policy in Sichuan and Yunnan, and the League Central Committee also wanted me to inspect local League affairs. I combined these two tasks, using League members to understand the implementation of intellectual policy in several universities in Chengdu and Kunming. I again adopted the above-mentioned working methods, one-sidedly reflecting the opinions of backward elements. It has now been proven that many situations did not conform to the facts. Most of those who spoke the most at that time have now been exposed as right-wing elements. These people were encouraged by me at that time, opening up anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, and also influencing many middle-of-the-road elements. The essence of my work during that period was sowing the seeds for the Zhang-Luo conspiracy, playing an organizational role among backward elements.

	6. In Chengdu and Kunming, I promoted my understanding of "mutual supervision" of the bourgeoisie's nature within the League, and carried out activities through the League organizations in these two places. At that time, I believed that the League organization should collect, synthesize, analyze, and study the problems and demands of League members and the intellectuals connected to them, and put forward concrete suggestions to the Party and the government for their consideration. This was done in both Chengdu and Kunming, but it was carried out through internal reporting methods. This approach, under the conditions at that time, meant that there were bourgeois intellectuals both inside and outside the League, and there were also some anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wing elements. If the opinions put forward by these people were not criticized, and were synthesized, they would inevitably contain backward and reactionary demands. If these demands were publicly announced to society or submitted to the Party in the name of the League organization, then wouldn't the League become a political organization representing these backward and reactionary elements? Wouldn't it become a bourgeois political party? Wouldn't it break away from the Party's leadership? This cannot be seen as a problem of working methods, but rather a problem of political line. This approach is essentially the approach of a bourgeois party out of power. Zhang and Luo saw the essence of this work, so in May of this year, they personally organized four groups, adopting the erroneous parts of this method to formulate the anti-Party and anti-socialist program they needed. The first scientific program was created in this way, and it has already been publicly put forward to attack the Party.

	7. After returning to Beijing from the Southwest in February of this year, I made extremely absurd anti-Party remarks at a forum held by the League Central Committee. I have already exposed the record of this speech myself at the group meeting of this National People's Congress (NPC). At that time, I believed that the problems of intellectuals were mainly due to two lids not being lifted. These two lids were essentially: not opening up idealism in academia, and not opening up bourgeois democracy in politics. This was completely putting forward anti-Party and anti-socialist demands from the standpoint of the bourgeoisie. This also shows my erroneous understanding of the two policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" and "mutual supervision," exposing my deeply hidden, uncriticized, and unreformed serious bourgeois ideology, especially the two issues of bourgeois "freedom" and "democracy," which, at the critical juncture of entering socialism, not only manifested stubbornly and tortuously in thought, but also dominated my activities. These absurd arguments were valued by Zhang and Luo, repeatedly publicized, and further developed.

	8. Based on that speech, I wrote "Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals." Luo Longji had read the manuscript and encouraged me to publish it. This article used obscure and hidden techniques to convey the feelings of backward intellectuals, playing a stimulating and enlightening role, and stirring up these anti-Party and anti-socialist emotions. It should be viewed in connection with the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. This article was indeed a signal to open up anti-communist and anti-socialist remarks to attack the Party. I accept and thank the three representatives, Li Da, Xia Kangnong, and Yang Dongchun, for their criticism and help. I should further criticize myself.

	9. At the China Democratic League Central Working Conference in March of this year, I proposed that the League's future work should focus on helping League members improve their professional skills and conduct ideological transformation through professional work. In essence, this was to resist or weaken transformation by emphasizing professional work, which was a basic policy of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. However, at this time, this proposition could no longer satisfy Zhang and Luo's demands and was not accepted by the meeting. The policy proposed by Zhang and Luo at that time was actually just one word: "release." They wanted to use the League's organization to ignite fires everywhere. They did indeed do so later. I spoke at the group meeting of this conference, advocating that the League should play a role in "organizational supervision," that is, League members should speak on behalf of intellectuals at the CPPCC or NPC meetings, and implement mutual supervision of the Party in the name of the League's organization. In fact, I was demanding that the League organization use all public occasions to put forward the demands of bourgeois intellectuals, influence public opinion, and alienate the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. I once supported Luo Longji's speech at the last CPPCC on behalf of intellectuals, which is a concrete example illustrating the essence of my proposition. I also provided Luo Longji with some materials and opinions, although I disagreed with many aspects of his speech. I also used the same proposition to influence the local League organizations in Suzhou.

	10. In Shanghai's Wenhui Daily, at the propaganda work conference convened by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and in Contending Monthly, I repeatedly opposed abolishing bourgeois social sciences, demanded their restoration, and also demanded that those former social science workers who had changed careers be arranged to return to their positions as soon as possible. This is a reflection of the idea of bourgeois restoration and has already entered into action. In my case, the proposal to restore sociology was initiated by Wenhui Daily.

	11. During my inspection period in Jiangsu, I conducted a short-term rural survey. I raised questions and made suggestions from a bourgeois standpoint and method, which in essence played a role in opposing and questioning socialism. In the reports I wrote, not only was there no class analysis, but the emphasis on shortcomings was used to cover up the Party's achievements in rural work. In some suggestions, it had a negative impact on inciting discord between the Party and the peasants. I also attempted to use these materials to write works for external propaganda. If I had done so, the harm caused would inevitably have been greater. My rural survey can prove that it is impossible to correctly reflect social reality without standing on the working class's position. Therefore, bourgeois social science cannot become a science either. My proposal to restore the old social sciences is essentially a reactionary political demand.

	12. During my inspection period, I also promoted "great blooming and great contending" at the League member forums in Suzhou and Wuxi, encouraging them to boldly open up anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, and to ignite fires in these places for the Zhang-Luo conspiracy.

	13. Immediately after returning to Beijing from Jiangsu in early June, although only for a few days, I actively participated in the discussion and drafting of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's anti-socialist program. I was not a member of the scientific system issue group, but I participated in the discussion and also put forward some suggestions for revision to this group. Although the short commentary attached to this program when it was published in Guangming Daily was not written by me, I should admit that I held this view at the time. I also participated in the discussion of the school Party committee system issue group and put forward proposals to weaken the Party's leadership. In my conversation with a Wenhui Daily reporter on June 6th (not published), I even said: "Can this rectification solve such a problem: How to create a condition so that everyone can shoulder the burden of the country and carry it to socialism?" This is a statement of wanting to usurp the Party's leadership, which is similar to Chu Anping's "Party's World." This also reveals the ultimate goal of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, but it is not to carry it to socialism, but to return to the status of a colony. This reveals the conspiracy of bourgeois restoration.

	14. Since I had become a core member of the Zhang-Luo Alliance in thought and action, when the right-wing elements were rampantly attacking the Party during the high tide of the Party's rectification, I had just returned to Beijing and participated in the important activities of the Zhang-Luo Alliance. On June 5th, I found Zhang Bojun at his door. On June 6th, I participated in the meeting of the Cultural Club. I made remarks that the situation was tense, that I distrusted the Party, and that I sympathized with those who were purged, and I expressed serious anti-Party emotions. This meeting provided the ambitious Zhang Bojun with a wrong analysis, making him complacent, eager to try, and feeling that the world was about to fall into chaos, that the Party was in trouble, and that the democratic parties had a great future. On June 8th, I also echoed Zhang Bojun's completely absurd slander of the People's Daily editorial. After he convinced me, he wanted me to convey to the United Front Department in the conversation that he could help the Party to clean up the mess. I willingly did so. In fact, I was used by him to send a message to the Party demanding blackmail. It didn't stop there. On June 10th, I was called by Zhang Bojun again. When he heard me say "those who speak are not guilty," he insisted that I speak at the League Central Committee forum, and he even wanted to use me as a cover for his retreat in the end. My crimes have reached their peak. I have stood on the front line of the Zhang-Luo Alliance's attack on the Party. I have committed heinous crimes, crimes of treason. If the Party hadn't woken me up in time, I don't know what heinous things I would have done. The Party saved me.

What have I been doing in the past two years? For whom have I been working? Now I understand that I was serving the two ambitious men Zhang and Luo, I was serving the ghost of the bourgeoisie, that already dead class. I harmed the Party and harmed the people. Under the direction and influence of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, using the organization of the China Democratic League, standing on the position of the bourgeoisie, I embarked on an anti-Party and anti-socialist political line and committed a series of crimes that harmed the Party and harmed the people.

Why have I committed such a big crime? I am still deeply reflecting. The main reason is that I myself did not abandon the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, resisted the Party's education, and did not carry out the due transformation, so that I fell into the quagmire of the bourgeois rightists and participated in the conspiratorial activities of the Zhang-Luo Alliance.

I hate my past, I must change my position; I hate the Zhang-Luo Alliance, I must draw a clear line with them, cut them off completely. I am grateful to the Party for opening the door for those of us who have made mistakes, those who have fallen into the rightist quagmire, and for educating us with the utmost kindness. Let me bravely enter this door, embark on the road to life, thoroughly transform myself, and create opportunities to atone for my sins to the people.

I have only been awake for a short time, and my understanding is not deep. I still need to explain my crimes and my thoughts in detail and conduct in-depth self-criticism. Today, I can only continue to expose my crimes to the conference, testify to the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo Alliance, and kneel before the people to confess my guilt. I will continue to reflect and participate in the anti-rightist struggle; I will study and transform myself in the struggle. I am determined to accept the Party's education and take the socialist road under the Party's leadership.

    向人民伏罪
    费孝通的发言
    我向人民伏罪，继续揭露自己的罪行，也就是为揭露章罗联盟的阴谋作见证。
      1、一九五五年下半年，我在中国民主同盟文教委员会工作。为了要发现知识分子问题，主张通过组织各种小型座谈会，邀请那些对党对社会主义心怀不满的盟员和所联系的知识分子，畅所欲谈，一吐衷曲，并采取不记名，不批评的工作方法。这项工作虽则反映了一些知识分子的黑暗面，具有一定的参考价值，但所起的危害性是极端严重的。①鼓励落后和反动思想在组织里露头，不加批判，得到滋长和蔓延。②影响中间分子。③很少邀请进步分子参加，隔离和孤立了进步势力。④不通过正规的组织生活来进行工作而采取直接由领导同志自由挑选名单，进行座谈，给野心分子利用合法组织，串联落后分子，搞阴谋活动的机会。⑤搜集了落后和反动意见，作为片面估计知识分子情况的根据，在盟的领导层中造成错觉，提供野心分子所需要的宣传资料，打动了他们利用这些知识分子作为他们政治资本的企图。
    在这项工作的开始和进行中，曾多次在盟中央向章罗所把持的会议上汇报和请示，得到章罗的批准和支持，他们并且亲自参加了这种串联活动。在一九五六年政治协商会议召开前一至二个月中，他们并指使要把这项工作作为经验推广到地方组织。我在这项工作中实际上执行了章罗联盟的“团结落后、争取中间、打击进步”的方针，并设计了实行这个方针的工作方法。
    2、一九五五年年底，我到南京、苏州、杭州视察，了解知识分子问题，向这些地方的盟组织推广了上述的串联活动，发生了不良影响。
    3、一九五六年政治协商会议中，为罗隆基那个挑拨党和知识分子关系的发言提供了资料和意见。
    4、章罗指定我参加民盟第二届代表大会盟务报告的起草工作。这个报告虽则经过多次修改，但其中后来为右派分子所利用的几点，我当时是支持的：①首先列出“发挥潜力”作为盟的主要工作任务。“发挥潜力”就是提高业务水平，搞好岗位工作；而把“提高觉悟”，也就是思想改造，压在其次。②把联系群众作为任务提出，而且强调联系落后分子。③肯定了在各级组织的领导同志亲自参加下，开展对盟员和盟外知识分子的串联访问工作。④批评了不善于代表盟员和盟所联系的群众的正当利益和要求，提出意见和建议。以上几点在章罗的解释下成了以钻研业务代替政治学习，吸收落后分子扩大势力，上下串联进行组织活动，代表落后要求向党进攻。这些是在章罗指使和影响下写成的，把章罗的反动方针，隐蔽地渗入了民盟的正式文件，为他们的阴谋服务。
    5、盟代表大会后，我去西南参加少数民族调查工作，国务院专家局要我到四川、云南顺便了解知识分子政策执行情况，盟中央也要我视察当地盟务。我把这两项任务结合了起来，通过盟员来了解成都、昆明若干高等学校关于知识分子政策执行情况。我又采取了上述工作方法，片面地反映了落后分子的意见。现在证明许多情况是不符合事实的。当时发言最多的那些人，现在大多已暴露是右派分子。这些人在那个时间受到了我的鼓动，开放了反党反社会主义的言论，而且还影响了许多中间分子。我那段工作实质是为章罗阴谋埋下了火种，在落后分子中起了组织作用。
    6、我在成都和昆明，在盟内宣传了我对于“互相监督”资产阶级本质的理解，并通过这两地盟组织进行了活动。当时我认为盟组织应当搜集盟员和所联系的知识分子的问题和要求，加以综合，分析和研究，提出具体建议向党和政府反映。在成都和昆明都这样做了，但采取内部汇报方式进行的。这种做法，在当时的条件下，就是盟内外都存在着资产阶级知识分子，而且还有一些反党反社会主义的右派分子，对这些人所提出的意见不作批判，综合起来，其中必然具有落后和反动的要求，如果用盟的组织名义向社会公开或向党提出，那么盟不就成了一个代表这些落后和反动分子的政治组织了么？不就成了资产阶级政党了么？不是摆脱了党的领导了么？这不能看成是一个工作方法问题，而实在是一个政治路线问题。这种做法实质上是资产阶级在野党的做法。章罗看出了这个工作的本质，所以在今年五月里，不惜亲自动手，组织四个小组，采取这个方法的错误部分，来制定他们所需要的反党反社会主义的纲领。第一个科学纲领就是这样搞出来的，而且已经公开提出向党进攻。
    7、从西南回到北京，今年二月，我在盟中央召开的座谈会上，发表了极端荒谬的反党论调。这个发言的记录，我已在这次人代会小组会上自己揭发了。我当时认为知识分子问题主要是由于两个盖子没有揭开。这两个盖子实质上是：学术上没有开放唯心主义，政治上没有开放资产阶级民主。这完全是站在资产阶级立场上提出的反党反社会主义的要求。这也说明了我对“百家争鸣”、“互相监督”两个方针的错误理解，暴露了我深藏心底，没有批判和改造的严重资产阶级思想，特别是资产阶级的“自由”和“民主”这两个问题，在进入社会主义的关头上，不但在思想上顽强曲折地表现出来，而且支配了我的活动。这些荒谬论调却为章罗所重视，反复宣传，并且加以发挥。
    8、根据那个发言，我写了“知识分子的早春天气”，稿子曾经罗隆基看过，他怂恿我发表。这篇文章用了晦涩隐蔽的手法，传出了落后知识分子的心情，起了刺激和启导作用，把这些反党反社会主义情绪勾动了起来。更应当和章罗联盟的阴谋联系起来看，这篇文章确是一个开放反共反社会主义言论向党进攻的信号。我接受并感谢李达、夏康农和杨东莼等三位代表对我的批判和帮助。我应当进一步自己批判。
    9、今年三月，民盟中央工作会议上，我提出了盟今后工作应当着重帮助盟员提高业务水平，通过业务进行思想改造的主张。实质上，是要以强调业务来抗拒或削弱改造，这是章罗联盟的一个基本方针。但这时，这种主张已不能满足章罗的要求，没有被会议所接受。章罗那时所提出的方针其实就是一个“放”字。他们要利用盟的组织到处点火。后来他们确是这样做了。我在这次会议的小组会上发言，主张盟应当发生“组织监督”作用，就是在政协或人民代表会议上，盟员应当代表知识分子发言，以盟的组织名义实行对党的互相监督。事实上，我是要求盟组织利用一切公开场合提出资产阶级知识分子的要求，影响社会舆论，离间党和知识分子的关系。我曾支持罗隆基在上次政治协商会上代表知识分子发言，正是一个具体例子，说明了我这种主张本质是什么。我还供给罗隆基一部分资料和意见，虽则我有许多地方不同意他的发言的。我在苏州也用同样的主张影响了当地盟的组织。
    10、在上海文汇报，在中共所召开的宣传工作会议上，在争鸣月刊，我一再反对取消资产阶级社会科学，要求予以恢复，并且要求及早安排那些改行了的旧社会科学工作者归队。这是资产阶级复辟思想的反映，而且已进入活动。以我个人来说，恢复社会学的主张是被文汇报发动起来的。
    11、在江苏视察时期，我进行了短期的农村调查，我从资产阶级立场和方法提出问题和建议，实质上起了反对和怀疑社会主义的作用。在所写的报道中，不但没有阶级分析，而且以强调缺点来掩盖党在农村工作中的成就。在某些建议中，更起了挑拨党和农民关系的恶劣影响。我还企图用这些资料，另行写成对外宣传作品，如果这样做了，可能引起的危害性必然更大。我的农村调查可以证明，不站在工人阶级立场上是不可能正确反映社会实际的。因此资产阶级社会科学也是不可能成为科学的，我提出恢复旧社会科学的要求实质上是一种反动的政治要求。
    12、我在视察期间还在苏州和无锡两地盟员座谈会上提倡“大放大鸣”，鼓动他们大胆开放反党反社会主义的言论，为章罗阴谋在这些地方点火。
    13、六月初刚从江苏回到北京，虽则只有几天工夫，我积极参加了章罗联盟的反社会主义纲领的讨论和起草。我并不是科学体制问题小组的成员，但参加了讨论，而且还为这个小组提出了一些修改意见。这个纲领在光明日报发表时所附的短论，虽则并不是我所写的，但是我应当承认，我当时是具有这种看法的。我又参加了学校党委制问题小组的讨论，提出了削弱党的领导的主张。六月六日我和文汇报记者谈话中（并未发表）甚至这样说：“这次整风能不能解决这样一个问题：怎样创造一个条件，让大家都来挑起国家这个担子，把它挑到社会主义去？”这是要篡夺党的领导权的话，和储安平的“党天下”异曲而同工。这也说出了章罗联盟最终的目的，只是并不是挑到社会主义去，而是退回到殖民地的地位去。这揭露了资产阶级复辟的阴谋。
    14、我既然思想上、行动上已经成了章罗联盟中的核心分子，当右派分子利用党的整风猖狂向党进攻的高潮中，我刚回到北京，就参加了章罗联盟的重要活动。六月五日找到章伯钧门上，六月六日参加了文化俱乐部的会议，我发表了时局紧张，对党不信任，同情肃反分子等言论和严重的反党情绪。这个会议为章伯钧这个野心家提供了错误的分析，使他得意忘形，跃跃欲试，觉得天下即将大乱，党已陷入困境，民主党派大有可为了。六月八日我又附和了章伯钧对人民日报社论完全荒谬的谰言。他把我说服之后，要我在和统战部谈话中转达他可以帮助党来收拾局面的话。我甘心地这样做了。事实上，我被他用来送了一封向党讹诈的口信。还不止此。六月十日我又被章伯钧叫去，他听到我说“言者无罪”的话，坚持要我去盟中央座谈会上发言，还想最后用我作他退却的掩护。我的罪行已达到了最高峰。我已站在章罗联盟向党进攻的最前线，我犯下了弥天大罪，叛国的大罪。如果不是党及时一棒子把我打醒，我不知道还会做出什么罪大恶极的事来。党拯救了我。
    我这两年来究竟搞些什么？究竟为了谁？现在我已明白，我是为章罗这两个野心家服务，我是为资产阶级，那个已经死亡的阶级的阴魂服务。我危害了党，危害了人民。我是在章罗联盟的指使和影响下，利用民盟的组织，站在资产阶级立场上，走上了反党反社会主义的政治路线，做下了一系列危害党，危害人民的罪行。
    为什么我会犯下这样大罪？我现在还在深刻反省，主要是我自己没有放弃资产阶级的反动立场，抗拒党的教育，没有进行应有的改造，以致跌入资产阶级右派的泥坑，参加了章罗联盟的阴谋活动。
    我痛恨自己的过去，我必须转变立场；我痛恨章罗联盟，我一定要和他们划清界限，一刀两断。我感激党为我们犯了错误的人，跌在右派泥坑里的人，敞开着翻改的大门，而且仁至义尽地教育我们。让我勇敢地投入这个门，走上生路，彻底改造自己，创造向人民赎罪的机会。
    我清醒还不久，认识还不深，对于我的罪行和我的思想还要详细交代，深入检讨。今天只能向大会继续揭露我的罪行，为揭露章罗联盟的阴谋作证，向人民伏罪。我将继续反省，参加反右派斗争；在斗争中学习，改造自己，我决心接受党的教育，在党的领导下走社会主义道路。
