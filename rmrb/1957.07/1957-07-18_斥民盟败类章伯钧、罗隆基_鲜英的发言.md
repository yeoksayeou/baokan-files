    Denouncing the Democratic League's Scoundrels Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji
    Xian Ying's Speech
    I completely agree with Premier Zhou's two reports and all other work reports.
    A few days ago, in the assembly hall, some old friends said to me: "The 'Democratic Home' has produced people like Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, truly 'spoiling the family reputation'!" Why aren't you speaking up? Comrades, it's not that I wasn't speaking up; I am deeply saddened, I am very angry, so indignant that I didn't know where to begin. Under the enlightenment of these old friends, I recalled the grand occasion of the Chongqing "Democratic Home" from the time the Democratic League of Political Groups was established in 1940, followed by its development into the Democratic League, until the victory of the War of Resistance and the Kuomintang reactionary government moved back to Nanjing at the end of 1945. Because the late Chairman Zhang Lan of the Democratic League lived in my home, comrades of the Democratic League, various democratic parties and non-party figures, as well as the Chinese Communist comrades led by Premier Zhou Enlai, often met in my home, forming a place for collective discussion of the anti-Japanese democratic united front centered on the CCP. Vice Chairman Guo Moruo gave it the name "Democratic Home" at that time. The Democratic League grew and strengthened from that time on, under the encouragement, instigation, support, and leadership of the CCP. The Democratic League is a group of petty-bourgeois intellectuals and has its revolutionary limitations. However, because it never deviated from the leadership of the Communist Party, it laid a correct line from democratic revolution to socialist revolution under the party's tempering and education; Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, Du Binzheng, Yang Bokai, and many other martyrs' blood and the sweat of many comrades who sacrificed their families and worked hard, wrote a glorious page in modern revolutionary history for this purpose. Unexpectedly, today, when the socialist revolution has achieved a basic victory, and the socialist construction is being successfully completed year by year according to plan, there are actually right-wing elements who are anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist coming from the Democratic League, from the "Democratic Home." True, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji were both members of the "Democratic Home" at that time, and the founders of the Democratic League. Today they are both vice-chairmen of the Democratic League and have very high positions in the government. One would only say that they have received much and deep education and training from the Party and should try their best to serve the country, but who would have thought that they would embark on the road of being anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist, and even want to lead the Democratic League to the road of being anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist?
    Now everyone has exposed their crimes. They are political ambitious people, dissatisfied with their existing political status, wanting to seize the opportunity of the Party's rectification to grab something, to create a Hungarian incident, to achieve their ulterior motives. They also don't recall what kind of treatment they received under Chiang Kai-shek's rule: what their political status was like, it can be said that they had none at all; what their lives were like, poor, down and out, unable to make a living, I had to run around many times to help them out. After liberation, what are their political status and living treatment like? I don't need to say any more about this. But it is difficult to raise petty people, and their desires are insatiable. Everyone knows that Zhang Bojun became the Minister of Communications in the early days of the founding of the country, but from the beginning, he had no sense of responsibility for the glorious position entrusted to him by the people, worked passively, and amused himself by collecting antiques and calligraphy and paintings, and shamelessly thought that he was "a hero without a place to use his talents, so he had to do this." What kind of mood is this? Luo Longji, seeing Zhang as a minister, could not help but feel inferior, and at any time revealed his dissatisfaction with the Party. They were even more incompatible with each other; Luo scolded Zhang as a street politician, and Zhang scolded Luo as a right-wing element, each forming small cliques, slandering each other. At that time, the late Chairman Zhang Lan was most troubled by them two. Until the Democratic League was changed to collective leadership, Zhang and Luo both became vice-chairmen, and Luo also became the Minister of Forestry Industry, their contradictions gradually disappeared. As their anti-Party and anti-people stench attracted each other, they colluded with each other, and then formed the Zhang-Luo alliance and attacked the Party with all their strength. May I ask, what exactly should the Party and the people do to them then?
    People can see very clearly that truly helping the Party rectify its style, eliminate the three evils, for example, removing insects for fruit trees, is to ensure the prosperity of the fruit trees, so that they can bear more beautiful fruits. Who said that the fruit trees should be uprooted, and also said that it is helping it to remove insect pests? Zhang and Luo did just that in the rectification campaign. There are still many people in our league who do not understand right and wrong and have unstable positions, listening to their commands, secretly colluding with them, from the central government to various regions, spreading the forged transmission reports by Zhang Bojun within the league, colluding up and down outside the league, setting fires everywhere, trying to create a tense situation in order to achieve their anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist goals. If the majority of upright comrades had not exposed them in time, and the broad masses of the people had not given them a head-on blow, the harm would have been unimaginable if their crimes had continued to develop.
    Reactionary right-wing elements, you have miscalculated. Did you think that by using a few backward old intellectuals, you could stir up trouble and do whatever you want? You don't think that most intellectuals have undergone ideological transformation and have a firm belief in socialism and have a love for the new society. The brilliant achievements of various socialist constructions completed under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party in the eight years since the founding of the country are as obvious as the sun and the moon, and compared to the era of reactionary rule, eight years is truly better than a hundred years, a world of difference. People will not be shaken by your lies in the slightest. You think the masses are ignorant, easy to deceive, and you can use the method of exaggerating individual shortcomings to sensationalize? You don't think that the broad masses of the people have turned themselves over in struggle. Their sense of smell is very sharp, their eyes are very bright, and they see most clearly who is a friend and who is an enemy. The right-wing elements' every move is immediately discovered by them. They cherish their revolutionary achievements like they cherish their own eyes and will never allow the enemy to have the opportunity to sabotage. The right-wing elements' conspiracies and tricks will never succeed.
    The Democratic League's scum, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji and other right-wing elements, attempted to oppose the Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism, and vainly attempt to steal the revolutionary fruits of the broad masses of the people, truly ruining the reputation of the "Democratic Home." As the former host of the "Democratic Home," I feel particularly angry and particularly heartbroken about this. Today, as a member of the Democratic League, I am speaking here as a people's representative: I want to denounce them, accuse them, I want to fight them resolutely to the end together with all the comrades who love socialism and uphold justice, and I will never stop fighting until complete victory!

    斥民盟败类章伯钧、罗隆基
    鲜英的发言
    我完全同意周总理的两项报告和其他各项工作报告。
    前几天在大会会场内，有几位老朋友向我说：“民主之家”出了章伯钧、罗隆基这样的人，真是“败坏门风”啊！你怎么不说话呢？同志们，我不是不说话，我痛心得很，我愤怒得很，愤懑之极，正不知从何说起。在这几位老朋友启示之下，使我回想起从一九四○年民主政团同盟成立时起，随后发展为民主同盟，直到抗战胜利，一九四五年底国民党反动政府迁回南京时为止，在这一段时间里的重庆“民主之家”的盛况。由于民主同盟故主席张澜同志住在我家，所以民盟同志、各民主党派和无党派人士以及以周恩来总理为首的中共同志，都经常在我家碰头，形成以中共为中心的抗日民主统一战线的集议场所，郭沫若副委员长当时给它起了个名叫“民主之家”。民主同盟也就是从那时起，在中共的鼓励、策动、扶持、领导之下成长壮大起来的。民盟是小资产阶级知识分子集团，有它的革命局限性。但由于始终没有离开共产党的领导，在党的陶熔教育下，奠定了由民主主义革命走向社会主义革命的正确路线；以李公朴、闻一多、杜斌丞、杨伯凯和其他很多烈士们的血和很多舍身忘家、艰苦奋斗的同志们的汗，曾为了这个目的在现代革命史上写下了光荣的一页。想不到在社会主义革命已经获得基本胜利的今天，在社会主义建设一年一年地按计划胜利完成的今天，竟会有反党、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子出自民盟，出自“民主之家”。不错，章伯钧、罗隆基都是当时“民主之家”的成员，是民主同盟的发起人，在今天他们又都做了民盟的副主席，在政府中有很高的职位，只说他们受党的教育培养多而且深，应当如何力图为国报效才是，谁想他们竟会走上反党、反人民、反社会主义的道路，更甚至想把民盟引向反党、反人民、反社会主义的道路上去呢？
    现在大家都把他们的罪行揭发出来了。他们是政治野心家，不满于现有的政治地位，想趁党整风的机会捞一把，搞一个匈牙利事件，来达到他们不可告人的企图。他们也不回想回想自己在蒋介石的统治下受的是什么样的待遇：政治地位怎么样，可以说丝毫说不上；生活怎么样，穷困、潦倒、无以为生，我曾经多次奔走张罗接济过他们。解放以后，他们的政治地位和生活待遇又是怎么样呢，这可不用我再说了。可是小人难养，欲壑难填。大家知道章伯钧在开国初期就做了交通部长，但他自始就对人民付托的光荣职务毫无责任感，消极怠工，自己却以搜集古董字画自娱，还恬不知耻地自以为是“英雄无用武之地，只好如此而已”。请看这是什么心情？罗隆基见章做了部长，自己不免相形见拙，就随时流露出对党的不满情绪。他们彼此之间更是水火不相容，罗骂章是马路政客，章骂罗是右派分子，各搞小集团，互相诋毁，那时使故张澜主席最感头痛的就是他们两个。直到民盟改为集体领导，章、罗都作了副主席，罗亦作了森林工业部长，他们之间的矛盾才逐渐消失，随着他们反党、反人民的臭味相投，沆瀣一气，于是又结成了章、罗同盟，并力向党进攻。试问像这样的人，究竟要党和人民对他们如之何而后可呢？
    人们都看得十分清楚，真正帮助党整风，清除三害，譬如为果树除虫，是为了保证果树的繁荣，使它能够多结美好的果子，那有说是把果树连根拔掉，还说是在帮助它在除虫害的呢？章、罗两人在整风中就是这样干的。我们盟内还有不少是非不明，立场不稳的人，听他们的指挥，和他们秘密勾结，由中央以至各地区，在盟内散布章伯钧伪造的传达报告，在盟外上下串联，四处放火，企图造成紧张局势，以达到他们反党、反人民、反社会主义的目的。要不是多数持正的同志及时揭发，广大人民群众予以迎头痛击，让他们的罪行继续发展下去，其为害还堪设想吗？
    反动的右派分子们，你们估计错了。你们以为利用少数落后的旧知识分子，就可以兴风作浪，为所欲为了吗？你们不想大多数知识分子经过思想改造，对于社会主义有了坚定的信仰，对新社会产生了热爱。开国八年来在中国共产党领导之下完成的各种社会主义建设的辉煌成就，像太阳、月亮一样，有目共睹，比起反动统治时代，真是八年比一百年，霄壤迥别。人们丝毫也不会为你们的谰言所动摇的。你们以为群众无知，容易欺骗，可以用夸大个别缺点的手法来耸人听闻？你们不想广大人民群众都是在斗争中翻身过来的，他们的嗅觉非常锐敏，他们的眼睛非常明亮，对谁是朋友谁是敌人看得最清楚，右派分子的一举一动，他们立即发现；他们珍惜自己的革命成果，像爱护自己的眼珠一样，决不让敌人有机会来破坏。右派分子的阴谋诡计是决不会得逞的。
    民盟的败类章伯钧、罗隆基等右派分子们企图反党、反人民、反社会主义，妄想窃取广大人民的革命果实，真是败坏了“民主之家”的门风。作为曾是“民主之家”东道主的我，对此特别感到愤怒，特别痛心。今天我以一个民盟的成员作了人民代表在此发言：我要声讨他们，控诉他们，我要和全体热爱社会主义拥护正义的同志们一道和他们坚决斗争到底，不到全部胜利决不收兵！
