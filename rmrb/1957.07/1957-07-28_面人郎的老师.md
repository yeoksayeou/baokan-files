The Dough Figurine Maker's Teacher
By Our Correspondent Hu Daoyuan

    On the streets of Beijing, there used to be a short, big-nosed man walking around with a box on his back. Sometimes he would be at temple fairs, sometimes on street corners, setting down his box, opening his stool, and sitting down to work. Children would gather around, watching him. He would pick out a piece of kneaded dough from the box, and with a few twists and pinches, it would become a smiling Luohan or a white-haired, venerable Old Man of Longevity. Children could buy one to play with for a few copper coins. Some mothers would ask him to make a little doll, telling him to dress the doll in a certain color, and he would match it with the appropriate color. If you spent a little more money, he could even make you a Jiang Taigong fishing scene.

    This was already a matter of a dozen or twenty years ago. Not long ago, his neighbor, an old lady, mentioned this dough figurine maker to me, saying meaningfully, "These past few years, I don't know why, but he's disappeared!"

    At the National Congress of Arts and Crafts Artisans, I met this dough figurine maker. It turned out that he had relied on his craft to travel to several major cities and had now settled down in Shanghai. His name is Zhao Kuoming.

    Making a dough figurine for a child to play with – no one ever thought about preserving it for long. Once, a foreign businessman bought a lot of them to take back, and after some time, Zhao Kuoming received a letter from abroad saying that the dough figurines had all cracked. How could dough figurines be made durable and not crack? Zhao Kuoming pondered this question, just as he had pondered the image of the dough figurines, even dreaming about solutions. He thought that green bean vermicelli never cracked, so he mixed some green bean flour into the dough. He heard that walnut oil had good viscosity, so he bought some walnuts to extract oil and mix it into the dough. He saw that glue could fix cracks in rubber shoes, fish maw could glue two pieces of wood together, tallow soap never cracked, and beeswax candles lasted a long time. He bought them all for experiments, but none of them worked. Finally, he saw that pills in traditional Chinese medicine stores could be preserved for a long time, so he went to ask them what they used to mix them. It took him five years to find honey, which could prevent the dough figurines from cracking. From then on, his dough figurines could be preserved for a dozen or twenty years without spoiling, becoming a kind of artistic piece that could be displayed for a long time.

    The dough figurines he makes are lifelike: *The Meeting at the Embroidered Tower*, *The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl*, *The Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea*, *Guifei Intoxicated*… all are like scenes on a stage. However, before liberation, he could not get enough food and clothing relying solely on this craft. He was forced to work as a porter at the station and as a servant in the homes of the powerful. After liberation, his artistic talents were developed. His works have been displayed at labor model conferences or health exhibitions in cities such as Qiqihar, Ang'angxi, Sipingjie, Jinzhou, and Shenyang. After arriving in Shanghai, he also made models for the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Exhibition and the Transportation Exhibition. From 1955 to 1956, he received three awards for making dough figurine models. In this way, his craft, which was originally used for children to play with, was transformed into a very good propaganda tool.

    He is now the Deputy Director of the Shanghai Arts and Crafts Research Institute. Lang Shao'an, the famous dough figurine artist who caused a sensation among audiences at the London exhibition in August and September 1956, was a student he personally trained. (Attached picture)

    面人郎的老师
    本报记者　胡道源
    在北京街头上，有一个矮个儿、大鼻子的人，背着箱满街走。有时候他在庙会上，有时候就在街头巷尾，放下箱子，打开马扎，坐起来干活。孩子们见到了，就围起来，看着他。他从箱子里挑出一块和好的面，几搓几捏，就成为一个喜笑颜开的罗汉或是黄发垂鬓的寿星了。孩子们花上几个铜板，就可以买个来玩。有些做妈妈的，要他捏个小娃娃，叫他给娃娃穿身什么颜色的衣服，他就可以给她配上什么颜色来。要是多花几个钱，他还可以给你捏个姜太公钓鱼呢。
    这已经是十几二十年以前的事了。不久前，他的邻居老太太跟我谈到这位捏面人的时候，就意味深长地说：“这些年头，不知怎的都不见他了！”
    在全国工艺美术艺人代表会上，我见到了这个捏面人的人。原来他凭借那套手艺，走遍了好几个大城市，现在已经在上海安家立户了。他的名字就叫赵阔明。
    用面粉捏个玩意给孩子玩玩，谁也没想到要保存多久。有一次，一个外国商人买了很多回去，过了些日子，赵阔明就接到国外的来信，说是面人都裂了。怎样才能使面人经久不裂呢？赵阔明也像原先琢磨面人的形象一样，连梦里都在想办法。他想到绿豆制的粉条经久不裂，就在面里和些绿豆面；听见有人说是核桃油的粘性好，就买些核桃仁来榨油和面；见到胶水能够补好胶鞋的裂缝，鱼膘能够把两块木头粘在一起，牛油制的肥皂从不裂开，白腊炼的腊烛长久不变，他都一一买来试验，结果都没有成功。最后，他看见中药店里的丸药可以长期保存，就去问他们是用什么调匀的，这样花了五年功夫，才找到了能使面人不裂的蜂蜜。从这以后，他作的面人，就可以保存十几二十年不坏，成为一种可以长期摆设的艺术品了。
    他捏的面人神采活现，楼台会、天河配、八仙过海、贵妃醉酒……，都像舞台上的一样。可是，在解放前，光靠这门手艺还不能吃饱穿暖。他被迫当过车站里的脚行，权贵人家的仆役。解放了，他的艺术才能得到发展。在齐齐哈尔、昂昂溪、四平街、锦州、沈阳等城市劳模大会或卫生展览会上，都有他的作品。到上海后，还为肃反展览会和交通展览会做过模型，在1955年到1956年就以制造面塑模型得过三次奖励。这样，他这门原来是用来给孩子玩的手艺，一变而成很好的宣传工具了。
    他现在已经是上海市工艺美术研究室的副主任。1956年8、9月间在伦敦展览会上轰动了观众的面人郎——郎绍安，就是他一手教出来的徒弟。（附图片）
