    96% and 100%
    Recently, public opinion in countries such as Japan and the Philippines has strongly advocated safeguarding their own judicial sovereignty, demanding that their own judicial organs try cases of American soldiers committing murder and other crimes on their territories. On the question of how to respond to this demand, the US President and some members of Congress have been in dispute.
    The congressmen advocate acting tough. They not only refuse the demands of Japan, the Philippines, and other countries, but also submitted a proposal to the House of Representatives, demanding the enactment of a law to simply "prohibit foreign trials of American soldiers who have committed crimes on foreign territory." When the US House of Representatives voted on the next year's "Foreign Aid Bill" on the 17th, 134 congressmen voted in favor of listing the above proposal as an additional clause to the "Foreign Aid Bill."
    However, the government authorities believe it is better to adopt a more sophisticated attitude. The US President wrote a letter to Martin, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, on the 20th. He admitted that this issue involves the sovereignty of the countries concerned and that the people of all countries have intense feelings on this issue. Therefore, he requested that such a law not be enacted. He explained that the US government had already signed separate agreements with countries where US troops are stationed, and these agreements are "already modified to our (US) advantage." According to these agreements, American soldiers basically enjoy the privilege of not being subject to the laws of the host country, although the agreements stipulate certain exceptions, but in fact they are rarely implemented. He gave an example: the Japanese government "has relinquished its primary jurisdiction in more than 96% of the cases in which Japan has the right to try convicted criminals." Therefore, the US President implied that enacting another law would not only be superfluous, but would also affect the relationship between the United States and its "allies," thereby "seriously threatening our security."
    This letter from the US President inadvertently reveals a cunning tactic of American neo-colonialists. When dealing with others, it often uses a lot of words like "equality," "friendship," and "common security" to decorate its actions of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries. When signing a treaty that causes the other party to lose its rights and dignity, it also writes in some "rights" reserved for the other party, but in actual implementation, most of these reservations become empty words. This was originally a secret of the US government, but it was unexpected that these congressmen were not satisfied with more than 96% in seizing privileges and demanded 100%, which forced the President to expose the true colors of American neo-colonialism.

    96％和100％
    最近，日本和菲律宾等国公众舆论强烈主张维护本国的司法主权，要求由本国的司法机关审讯美国军人在它们的领土上杀人犯罪的事件。在如何应付这种要求的问题上，美国总统和一些国会议员发生了争执。
    议员们主张蛮干。他们不但拒绝日、菲等国的要求，而且向众议院提出了一个方案，要求制定一项法律，干脆“禁止外国审判在外国领土上犯有罪行的美国兵”。17日美国众院表决下一年度“援外法案”的时候，还有一百三十四名议员投票赞成把上述方案列为“援外法案”的一个附加条款。
    但是，政府当局认为不如采取圆滑态度。美国总统在20日写了一封信给众议院里的共和党头子马丁。他承认这问题牵涉到有关国家的主权。而各国的人民在这个问题上有着激烈的情绪。所以他要求不制定这样一条法律。他解释说，美国政府早就同驻有美军的国家分别签订了协定，这些协定是“已被修饰得对我们（美国）有利的”。根据这些协定，美国士兵基本上是享受不受驻在国法律管辖特权的，虽然协定中规定有某些例外情况，但事实上也是不大实行的。他举例说：日本政府“在96％以上日本有权利审判被断定的罪犯的案件中放弃了它的首要司法权”。因此，美国总统暗示，再制定一个法律不但是多余的，而且会反而影响美国和它的“盟国”的关系，从而“严重地威胁我们的安全”。
    美国总统这封信，无意中道出了美国新殖民主义者的一种狡猾手法。它在同别人打交道时，经常用一大堆“平等”、“友好”、“共同安全”之类的话来装璜它的侵犯别国主权的行动。在签订一项使对方丧权辱国的条约时，它也要写上若干为对方保留的“权利”，但在实际执行中，这些保留十之八九变成了空话。这原来是美国政府的一种机密，未想到这些议员在攫取特权中并不满足于96％以上而要求100％，这一下逼得总统把美国新殖民主义的马脚露出来了。
