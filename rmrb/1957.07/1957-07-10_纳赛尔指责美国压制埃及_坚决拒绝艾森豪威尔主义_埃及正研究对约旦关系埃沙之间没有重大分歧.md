Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 9th – Egyptian President Nasser said that the aid provided under the Eisenhower Doctrine has political conditions, "therefore, this kind of aid is unacceptable to us."

Nasser made these remarks on July 7 in a conversation with Wilbur Landrey, the Middle East bureau chief of United Press International. He emphasized Egypt's policy of non-alignment and refuted the Western countries' slander that this policy "opens the door for Soviet influence to penetrate the Middle East." He said, "When the West attempts to oppose nationalism, they meet with the opposition of the people, so they say this is opening the door for the Russians in the Middle East. The purpose of neutrality is sovereignty, dignity and independence."

Nasser accused the United States of "trying to exert political and economic pressure on Egypt." He said that if the United States' policy changes, relations between Egypt and the United States will improve.

Regarding the restoration of normal relations between Egypt and Britain and France, Nasser said that Egypt and Britain will resume negotiations in Rome in twenty days. Britain will send a delegation to Egypt to check British property in Egypt. He said that the Bank of France and the French government have requested negotiations with Egypt on economic issues, and these negotiations will be held soon.

Nasser said that he does not believe that there are major differences between Egypt and Saudi Arabia as reported in the newspapers. He also said that Egypt is studying its relations with Jordan. If Egypt is to provide financial assistance to Jordan, Egypt hopes to be certain that Jordan's situation will make it possible to fulfill the agreement concluded between Jordan and Egypt for the security of the two countries. Nasser refuted Dulles' recent statement that the United States is assisting Jordan because Egypt and Syria have not fulfilled their obligations to assist Jordan, saying: "I think Dulles is looking for an excuse for the new relationship between Jordan and the United States in front of the Jordanian people."

Nasser said that although Israel refuses to allow the United Nations Emergency Force to be stationed on both sides of the determined armistice line, for the sake of peace, Egypt's policy is to still allow the United Nations Emergency Force to be stationed on the demarcation line within Egyptian territory. He also said that Egypt will accept the ruling of the International Court of Justice on whether Israeli ships have the right to sail in the Suez Canal or the Gulf of Aqaba, as long as Israel first agrees to this ruling.

Regarding Egypt's internal affairs, Nasser said: "Our main task in the past and in the future is to improve the living standards of the people." He also said that due to the cancellation of all parties, we are in a state of vacuum in the political sphere, so a new and pure political life must be established in the next five years.

    纳赛尔指责美国压制埃及
    坚决拒绝艾森豪威尔主义
    埃及正研究对约旦关系埃沙之间没有重大分歧
    新华社9日讯　开罗消息：埃及总统纳赛尔说，根据艾森豪威尔主义所提供的援助是有政治条件的，“因此这种援助对我们来说是不可接受的。”
    纳赛尔是在7月7日对合众社中东分社社长威耳伯·兰德雷谈话时说这番话的。他强调了埃及采取的不参加集团的政策，并且驳斥了西方国家把这种政策说成是“为苏联势力渗入中东打开了道路”的谰言。他说：“当西方企图反对民族主义的时候，它们遇到了人民的反对，因此他们就说这是在中东给俄国人打开了道路。中立的目的是主权、尊严和独立。”
    纳赛尔指责美国“正在设法对埃及施加政治和经济压力”。他说，如果美国的政策有改变的话，埃及同美国的关系是会好起来的。
    在谈到埃及同英国和法国恢复正常关系的问题时，纳赛尔说，埃及同英国将在二十天内在罗马恢复谈判。英国将派一个代表团到埃及点查英国在埃及的财产。他说，法兰西银行和法国政府曾经要求同埃及在经济问题上举行谈判，这种谈判不久就会举行。
    纳赛尔说，他认为埃及同沙特阿拉伯之间并没有像报纸所说的那样发生重大分歧。他还说，埃及正在研究它同约旦的关系。如果要埃及给约旦财政援助，埃及希望能够肯定约旦的情况会使它有可能履行约旦和埃及之间为了两国安全而缔结的协定。纳赛尔驳斥了杜勒斯最近所说美国正在援助约旦是因为埃及和叙利亚没有履行它们援助约旦的义务的说法，他说：“我认为杜勒斯是在约旦人民面前为约旦和美国之间的新关系寻找借口。”
    纳赛尔说，虽然以色列拒绝联合国紧急部队驻扎在业经决定的停战线两边，但是为了和平，埃及的政策是仍然让联合国紧急部队驻扎在埃及境内的分界线上。他还说，埃及将接受国际法院就以色列船只是否有权在苏伊士运河或亚喀巴湾行驶的裁决，只要以色列先同意这个裁决。
    在谈到埃及的内政问题时，纳赛尔说：“我们的主要任务过去和将来都是提高人民的生活水平。”他还说，由于一切党派的取消，我们在政治方面处在一种真空状态，因此在今后五年内必须建立一种新的、纯洁的政治生活。
