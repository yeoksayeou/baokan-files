    A Vicious Right-Wing Clique

    The right-wing clique led by Pang Xunqin at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts launched a frenzied attack on the Party's leadership and the socialist cause before and after the Party began its rectification campaign. They attempted to first seize the leadership of this academy and then the leadership of the entire national arts and crafts field. The head of this right-wing clique, Pang Xunqin, was the vice president of the academy and the chairman of the China Democratic League branch. Its main members were Professor Zheng Ke, Liu Shouqiang, the secretary of the dean's office, and He Yanming, the secretary of the Arts and Crafts Science Research Institute. Liu and He were both Communist Party members, but Pang dragged them into the mire and made them important members of the right-wing clique. This clique was organized, had a program, and had a well-thought-out plan and strategic deployment for its attacks.

    Directing the Attack First at the Handicraft Industry Administration

    The Central Academy of Arts and Crafts was a new institution of higher learning established last year. The State Council stipulated that the academy would be under the business leadership of the Ministry of Culture and the administrative leadership of the Handicraft Industry Administration (hereinafter referred to as the Handicraft Administration). It is conceivable that such a newly established institution would have difficulties and shortcomings in its work. In response, teachers and students made some suggestions, many of which were correct, but the right-wing elements used this to launch an attack on the Party in order to achieve their goal of usurping leadership.

    Starting in November of last year, the Pang Xunqin clique launched active activities inside and outside the academy. Inside the academy, Pang said that the Handicraft Administration was an "amateur" in arts and crafts, and "amateurs" cannot lead professionals. He also spread rumors, sowing discord, saying: "The Handicraft Administration brought a group of people to engage in sectarianism and to monitor us." He did not recognize the Party branch in the academy, saying: "I have long ago negated the Party branch in the school." Liu Shouqiang also followed suit, shouting slogans, saying: "The Handicraft Administration is riding on the heads of others, and treats senior intellectuals with 'rape' tactics." He scolded those who leaned towards the Handicraft Administration as "lackeys" and "secret agents." They also wanted to sabotage the National Arts and Crafts Artists' Representative Conference held by the Handicraft Administration. They said that arts and crafts artists should not be led by the Handicraft Administration; and spread rumors that the convening of the Arts and Crafts Artists' Representative Conference was to provoke the relationship between artists and arts and crafts craftsmen. He Yanming also shouted: "I oppose this meeting, I want to sue." They also planned to hold another Arts and Crafts Artists' Representative Conference after the Handicraft Administration held its meeting, to compete with the Handicraft Administration.

    Outside the academy, they carried out activities everywhere, engaging in so-called "obtaining external support." The right-wing element Zheng Ke, ran to Chen Mingshu's door. At a cultural and educational symposium held by the CPPCC, he launched a massive attack on the Ministry of Culture and the Handicraft Administration. Chen Mingshu cheered them on at the meeting, shouting: "I want to warn the Ministry of Culture." At the same time, Pang sent Liu Shouqiang to Nanjing, Suzhou and Shanghai arts and crafts circles to carry out activities, declaring everywhere: "Pang Xunqin's fight against Deng Jie has received the support of Jiang Feng and others," "It is a nationwide struggle."

    After the rectification movement began, Pang Xunqin published an article in the People's Daily entitled "Follow the Party, the Truth Will Always See the Sun," falsely accusing the leadership of the Handicraft Industry Administration of "unreasonable and crude interference" in the work of art education. He falsely accused the Ministry of Culture of being "heartless parents" to the academy. And made distorted propaganda against the responsible comrades of the Party group of the Handicraft Administration. At a rectification forum, he said: "There are the ugliest, most despicable, and shameful things that cannot be seen in the Communist Party of the Handicraft Administration and the academy." "The Handicraft Industry Administration and the Party group are not qualified to lead us, I do not recognize the leadership of this Party, I have suffered all kinds of persecution, I want to rise up and fight." He also called on young people to "fight" with him. He Yanming also sang a duet with him, saying: "The Party members of the Handicraft Administration are all Deng Jie's Party members, an independent kingdom." He scolded the "personnel department" of the Handicraft Administration as a "privileged organ." At the same time, Pang also organized his right-wing clique to put forward "ten suggestions" to the Party. The suggestions openly proposed to "organize a Central Academy of Arts and Crafts Rectification Committee,... to thoroughly check the overall work of the Academy of Arts and Crafts since its establishment, comprehensively plan and adjust the academy's organizational structure and personnel establishment, establish various systems and other rectification measures." And said: "During the period when the Academy Affairs Rectification Committee is carrying out its work, it is necessary to remove the administrative powers of the current four presidents. The Academy Affairs Rectification Committee will consider candidates for the future president and vice president and submit them to the State Council for reappointment." The obvious purpose of their actions was to drive away the current president, Communist Party member Deng Jie, and the vice president and secretary of the CCP branch, Wang Jingrui.

    Proposed an Anti-Party Program and Received Support from Jiang Feng

    After the State Council decided on May 18 this year that the academy would be led by the Ministry of Culture, Pang Xunqin thought he had "won" and became even more blatant in his anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. He Yanming, under the guise of various departments, drafted a proposal and handed it to the Ministry of Culture. It said that Deng Jie was "incompetent" and "unable to lead this school"; advocated that Wang Jingrui also be transferred back to the Handicraft Administration; and suggested that the academy be led by an "Academy Affairs Committee." Pang Xunqin also designated Wang Jingrui and others to be transferred away from the school to the Ministry of Culture. When Vice Ministers Qian Junrui and Liu Zhiming summoned Pang and others for talks, the right-wing elements threatened them with great democracy, saying: "If the Ministry of Culture does not agree to our demands, the school will make a big democratic commotion." And said they wanted to "bomb" away President Deng Jie. At the same time, Zheng Ke put on an ugly face and knelt down to Comrades Qian and Liu, asking them to believe their claims.

    In the process of opposing the leadership of the Handicraft Administration, the Pang Xunqin right-wing clique had been calling for the Ministry of Culture to lead the academy, but it later proved that this was completely a trick. Early on, they believed that the leaders of the Ministry of Culture "did not understand" arts and crafts. They also did not respect the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee. Pang Xunqin said that the central leading comrades all liked handicrafts, and Zhu De liked those "cumbersome" things. Deng Jie's enthusiasm for handicrafts was to please the central government in order to get a "promotion." Shortly after the academy was transferred to the leadership of the Ministry of Culture, this right-wing clique came up with a reactionary "Central Academy of Arts and Crafts Organizational Regulations (Draft)," which openly abolished the Party's leadership in the school. In this "Draft," they put forward the "principles" and "specific measures" of "democratic school management." This "Organizational Regulations (Draft)" was more detailed than the "democratic school management" plan proposed by Tao Dayong. Pang Xunqin said that Jiang Feng, president of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, also agreed with this plan; The three suggestions put forward by Jiang Feng constituted the main content of the plan. This "Draft" abolished the Party committee system and stipulated that the highest authority of the school was the "Academy Affairs Committee"; "The Academy Affairs Committee shall be elected by all parties, including representatives of various departments, professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, staff representatives, the Communist Party, democratic parties, trade unions, and the Communist Youth League"; "The Academy Affairs Committee shall elect five to seven standing committee members to form the Standing Committee; elect the president and vice president and submit them to the State Council for appointment (approval)." Pang also proposed that Liu Shouqiang be the candidate for the Party's future member of the Academy Affairs Committee. At this time, the activities of the right-wing clique headed by Pang Xunqin could be said to have reached the most rampant degree of anti-Party and anti-socialism.

    Disintegrating the CCP Branch of the Academy, Replacing the Party with the League

    The tactics adopted by the Pang Xunqin right-wing clique when attacking the Party were appalling. They first disintegrated the Party branch from within. Liu Shouqiang was called "my incarnation" by Pang, and He Yanming was also Pang's capable "military advisor." Although they were "Communist Party members," in reality they had already been won over by Pang Xunqin's personal ambition. Pang Xunqin promised Liu that he could be the director of the dean's office and the secretary of the Communist Party branch in the future; he promised He that he would definitely be able to engage in business research work in the future. These were very agreeable to Liu and He's petty calculations. As a result, they betrayed the Party and became Pang Xunqin's agents in the Party. Liu Shouqiang was the propaganda and education committee member of the Party branch, and he told Pang Xunqin everything about the Party. He said: "Ideologically, I no longer have a line between inside and outside the Party, only a line between the Handicraft Administration and the academy." Liu Shouqiang provoked the relationship between Party members from the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Party members from the Handicraft Industry Administration, creating division. He described the Hungarian incident as a "revolutionary movement," and also said that "Party work can be done well even without Party members."

    Liu Shouqiang opposed the higher Party committee and the Youth League committee sending cadres to the academy to do Party and Youth League work. He said: "The academy does not need any more Party and League cadres, because there are people here doing Party and League work (referring to him and He)." Liu Shouqiang was single-mindedly thinking of "absorbing" Pang Xunqin into the Party, boasting how "active" and "enthusiastic about the arts and crafts cause" Pang was. Because the branch committee had never approved it, Pang had not been able to sneak into the Party.

    After the rectification began, Liu Shouqiang also proposed to bring He Yanming and Pang Xunqin into the rectification leadership group. He said: "The work of the academy and the rectification must be led by Pang Xunqin to be done well." Later, because the higher Party committee did not approve it, this conspiracy was not realized.

    After joining the League in October last year, Pang Xunqin claimed: "Although the Party members in our academy understand business, they are young; the cadres sent by the Handicraft Administration do not understand business, so the League should play a role." Later, what role did the League actually play? That is, he used the League as a base to attack the Party.

    In early May of this year, the Ministry of Culture asked the academy to make a work summary, so Pang Xunqin privately convened a meeting of the academy's China Democratic League branch, inviting a few Party members to participate, to summarize the work of the academy.

    The Pang Xunqin right-wing clique was very good at using two-faced tactics to incite the masses when carrying out anti-Party activities. In order to create dissatisfaction with the Handicraft Administration among the students, they distorted and publicized a "Plan for Establishing the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts (Draft)" proposed by the Handicraft Administration in March of this year, saying that the Handicraft Administration wanted to turn the school into a "workshop." When Dean Deng Jie convened teachers above the lecturer level from the entire academy to go to the Handicraft Administration to attend a meeting to discuss this "Draft," Pang immediately gathered the members of their small clique in advance and won over some teachers to hold a meeting to think about countermeasures. They walked into the house one by one, closed the curtains, and even put a sentry outside. This sneaky activity was called "underground activity" by Pang.

    The scope of activities of the Pang Xunqin right-wing clique was very wide. In addition to Liu Shouqiang going to Nanjing, Suzhou, Shanghai and other places to set fires, He Yanming went to Wenhui Daily several times to appeal for support. Mei Duo, a right-wing element of Wenhui Daily, also promised to write an editorial for them. They manipulated an unpublished publication called "Arts and Crafts Newsletter," using it to attack and slander the Handicraft Administration and the Party group of the Handicraft Administration in various ways. They also communicated with Xu Zhucheng, a right-wing element of Shanghai Wenhui Daily: In May, after Pang Xunqin's anti-Party remarks were published in the People's Daily, Xu Zhucheng wrote a letter to Pang Xunqin through Fu Lei to encourage him.

    Now all the teachers and students of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts have recognized Pang Xunqin's true colors, torn open his scholar's coat, exposed him as a fake arts and crafts artist, and actively launched a struggle against Pang Xunqin. Pang Xunqin has been very dishonest to this day, but the teachers and students unanimously expressed: We will never stop until we win a complete victory.

    一个毒辣的右派集团
    新华社记者　王孔诚
    中央工艺美术学院以庞熏琴为首的右派集团，在党开始整风前后，就向党的领导和社会主义事业进行了猖狂的进攻。企图先夺取这个学院的领导，进而夺取全国工艺美术界的领导。这个右派集团的首脑庞熏琴是学院的副院长和民盟区分部主任委员，它的主要成员是教授郑可，院长办公室秘书刘守强，工艺美术科学研究所秘书何燕明。刘、何两人都是共产党员，但被庞拉下泥坑成为右派集团的重要分子。这个集团是有组织，有纲领，而且在进攻中有周密计划和策略部署的。
    把进攻矛头首先对准手工业管理局
    中央工艺美术学院是去年才成立的一所新的高等学府。国务院规定该学院由文化部负责业务领导手工业管理局（下简称手管局）进行行政领导，这样一所新办的学府，工作上会有困难和缺点，是可想而知的。对此，师生们提了一些意见，其中不少意见是对的，但是右派分子为了达到篡夺领导权的目的，却利用这点向党展开了进攻。
    从去年11月间开始，庞熏琴集团就在院内院外展开积极的活动。在院内庞说：手管局对工艺美术是“外行”，“外行”不能领导内行。还造谣挑拨地说：“手管局带来了一套人马是搞宗派的，来监视我们的。”他不承认学院中的党支部说：“我早已把学校中的党支部否定了。”刘守强也跟着摇旗呐喊地说：“手管局是骑在别人头上的，对待高级知识分子是‘强奸’的手法。”他骂靠拢手管局的人是“狗腿子”“特务”。手管局召开全国工艺美术艺人代表会议，他们也要破坏。他们说，工艺美术艺人不应当由手管局领导；并造谣说，工艺美术艺人代表会议的召开是为了挑拨艺人和工艺美术家的关系。何燕明还叫喊道：“我反对这个会，我要控告。”他们还计划在手管局开毕艺人代表会议后，再开艺人代表会议，要和手管局唱对台戏。
    在院外，他们四出活动，进行所谓“取得外援”的工作。右派分子郑可，奔走于陈铭枢门下。在政协举行的文教座谈会上，对文化部和手管局大肆攻讦。陈铭枢在会上为他们打气撑腰，大喊：“我要警告文化部。”同时，庞派出刘守强到南京、苏州和上海工艺美术界活动，到处声言：“庞熏琴领导的反对邓洁的斗争，已得到江丰等人的支持”，“是全国规模的斗争”。
    整风运动开始后，庞熏琴在人民日报上发表了一篇题为“跟着党走，真理总会见太阳”的文章，诬蔑手工业管理局对学院的领导是对艺术教育工作的“无理而粗暴的干涉”。诬蔑文化部对学院是“忍心的父母”。并对手管局党组的负责同志作了歪曲的宣传。在一次整风座谈会上他说：“手管局和学院的共产党内有最丑恶、最卑鄙无耻，见不得人的东西。”“手工业管理局与党组不配领导我们，我不承认这个党的领导，我受尽迫害，我要起来斗争。”他还号召年青人一起跟他“斗争”。何燕明也和他唱双簧，他说：“手管局的党员都是邓洁的党员，是独立王国。”骂手管局“人事科”是“特权机关”。同时，庞还组织他的右派集团向党提出了“十点建议”。在建议书中公然提出要“组织一个中央工艺美术学院院务整顿委员会，……彻底检查工艺美术学院自建院以来的全面工作，通盘计划并调整学院组织机构和人事编制，建立各项制度等整顿措施”。并且说：“在院务整顿委员会执行工作期间，有必要解除现任四位院长的行政职权。由院务整顿委员会考虑今后的院长、副院长人选，提请国务院重新任命。”他们这样作的目的明显地就是想赶走正院长共产党员邓洁和副院长兼中共支部书记王景瑞。
    提出了反党纲领得到了江丰支持
    国务院在今年5月18日决定该院由文化部领导后，庞熏琴以为自己“胜利”了，便更加明目张胆地干起反党、反社会主义的勾当来。何燕明假冒各系的名义拟了一份建议书，交给文化部。其中说邓洁“不称职”，“无能力领导这个学校”；主张王景瑞也调回手管局；建议学院由“院务委员会”来进行领导。庞熏琴也向文化部指名要王景瑞等调离学校。在钱俊瑞、刘芝明两位副部长召集庞等谈话时，右派分子竟以大民主相威胁，说：“文化部如不答应我们的要求，学校会闹大民主”。并说要“轰”走邓洁院长。同时，郑可又装出一副丑相，向钱刘两同志下跪，要求相信他们那一套。
    庞熏琴右派集团在反对手管局领导的过程中，一直是在呼吁要文化部领导学院，可是后来证明他们这完全是一个骗局。很早他们就认为文化部的领导人“不懂”工艺美术。他们把党中央的领导同志也没看在眼里。庞熏琴说，中央的领导同志都喜欢手工艺，朱德就喜欢那些“繁琐”的东西。邓洁热心于手工艺是为了讨好中央，为了“升官”。在学院改由文化部领导之后不久，这一右派集团就拿出了一个反动的公然取消党在学校中领导权的“中央工艺美术学院组织条例简则”，在这个“简则”里他们提出了“民主治校”的“原则”和“具体措施”。这“组织条例简则”比陶大镛提出的“民主治校”方案还要详细。庞熏琴说，这个方案中央美术学院院长江丰也同意；江丰对他提出的三点建议，构成了方案的主要内容。这“简则”取消了党委制，确定学校最高的权力机关是“院务委员会”；“院务委员会由各方面选举产生，包括各系代表、教授、讲师、助教代表、职工代表、共产党、民主党派、工会、共青团代表”；“院务委员会选举常务委员五至七人，组成常务委员会；选举院长、副院长提请国务院任命（批准）。”庞还提出将来院务委员会的人选，党由刘守强担任候选人。这时候，以庞熏琴为首的右派集团的活动可说达到了反党反社会主义最猖獗的程度。
    瓦解学院的中共支部，以盟代党
    庞熏琴右派集团在对党进攻时采取的策略是使人怵目惊心的。他们首先由内部来瓦解党的支部。刘守强被庞称为“我的化身”，何燕明也是庞的得力“军师”。他们虽然是“共产党员”，实际上已是被庞熏琴拉过去的个人野心分子。庞熏琴答应刘将来可以作院长办公室的主任和共产党的支部书记；答应何将来一定可以搞业务研究工作。这些都很投合刘、何的小算盘。结果，他们就叛变了党，成为庞熏琴右派集团在党内的代理人。刘守强是党支部的宣教委员，他把党内的事情都毫无保留地告诉庞熏琴。他说：“我思想上已没有党内、党外这一条线，只有手管局和学院一条线。”刘守强挑拨由中央美术学院来的党员和手工业管理局来的党员之间的关系，制造分裂。他把匈牙利事件说成是“革命运动”，还说“没有党员的地方也可以作好党的工作”。
    刘守强反对上级党委和团委派干部来学院作党和团的工作。他说：“学院不需要再来党、团干部，因为这里有人作党、团的工作（指他和何）。”刘守强一心想把庞熏琴“吸收”进党里来，吹嘘庞如何“积极”，“热心于工艺美术事业”，由于支委会始终没有通过，所以庞才没有混进党内来。
    整风开始后，刘守强还提出要求把何燕明和庞熏琴拉到整风领导小组中来。他说：“学院的工作和整风必须要庞熏琴领导才能搞好。”后来由于上级党委没有批准，这一阴谋才没有实现。
    庞熏琴在去年10月入盟后即声称：“我院党员，虽懂业务，但年青；手管局派来的干部不懂业务，故盟应该起作用。”以后，盟到底起到什么作用呢？那就是他利用盟作为基地，向党进攻。
    今年5月初，文化部要学院作工作总结，庞熏琴便私自召集学院民盟支部开会，请少数党员参加，总结学院的工作。
    庞熏琴右派集团在进行反党活动时很会用两面手法去煽动群众。他们为了在学生中造成对手管局的不满，就把手管局在今年3月间提出的一个“创办中央工艺美术学院计划（草案）”歪曲地加以宣传，说手管局要把学校办成“作坊”。当邓洁院长召集全院讲师以上的教师去手管局开会，讨论这个“草案”时，庞即预先把他们的小集团成员聚在一起，并拉拢一部分教员开会想对策。他们一个个的走进房子，拉上窗帘，还在外面放了哨。这种鬼鬼祟祟的活动被庞称为“地下的活动”。
    庞熏琴右派集团的活动范围是很广的。除了刘守强去南京、苏州、上海等地放火外，何燕明曾几次去文汇报呼吁支持。文汇报的右派分子梅朵还答应给他们写社论。他们操纵了一个不公开发行的刊物“工艺美术通讯”，利用它对手管局和手管局党组进行各方面的攻击和诬蔑。他们和上海文汇报的右派分子徐铸成也通了气：5月，当庞熏琴的那篇反党言论在人民日报上发表之后，徐铸成曾通过傅雷给庞熏琴写过一封信，加以鼓励。
    现在中央工艺美术学院的全体师生已经认清了庞熏琴的真面目，撕开他学者的外衣，揭发他是一个冒牌的工艺美术家，积极地向庞熏琴展开了斗争。庞熏琴到现在为止，态度还很不老实，可是师生们一致表示：不获全胜，决不收兵。
