Xinhua News Agency, London, July 16th: According to TASS, Soviet representative Zorin criticized the American disarmament proposal on July 15th at the United Nations Disarmament Commission's Subcommittee.

He said that the American representative, Stassen, summarized on July 12th in the Subcommittee the current American attitude on the question of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and listed five points that the United States agreed to implement. However, it is not difficult to see that these points are merely generalities and do not explain the essence of the American position. This explanation absolutely does not help to clarify the American position and will not be conducive to seeking mutually acceptable agreements.

Zorin then compared the American and Soviet attitudes on the five points mentioned by Stassen. He said that Stassen's first point stated: "Stop testing." The American proposal to stop testing for ten months will not hinder regular testing according to already made plans, and the United States proposed that the premise for stopping testing is reaching an agreement on other disarmament issues. There are still great difficulties in the path of resolving these issues due to the position taken by Western countries.

The Soviet Union proposes to immediately make a decision to stop testing various atomic and hydrogen weapons for two to three years and to implement international supervision of this, and not to make this decision dependent on the resolution of other disarmament issues.

Stassen's second point stated, "Stop producing bombs." Everyone knows that the United States has not proposed to stop the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Its position on this issue is to suggest reaching an agreement on the future cessation of the production of fissile materials for military use. Here, the United States insists that all countries have the right to manufacture and improve atomic weapons with the fissile atomic materials that have already been accumulated.

The Soviet Union proposes to stop the production of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons, with the aim of making this measure of practical significance for eliminating the threat of atomic war, and this measure should be taken at the same time as completely prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, removing such weapons from the armaments of all countries, and destroying all such weapons now stored.

Stassen's third point stated, "Start using bombs for the needs of power stations." The United States proposes to gradually use fissile materials for peaceful purposes. At the same time, it firmly refuses to completely eliminate atomic and hydrogen weapons from the armaments of all countries.

The Soviet Union believes that it is necessary to completely eliminate atomic and hydrogen weapons from the armaments of all countries and to use fissile materials only for peaceful purposes: atomic energy power stations and transportation, etc.

Stassen's fourth point stated, "Never use nuclear weapons to aggress against other countries." How did the United States propose to solve this problem, and how did the Soviet Union propose to solve it? The United States and other Western countries refuse to undertake the obligation not to use atomic and hydrogen weapons, and they defend the use of such weapons for military purposes, saying that it is the main "deterrent" weapon.

The Soviet Union proposes that all countries now solemnly guarantee not to use any type of atomic and hydrogen weapons for military purposes.

Stassen's fifth point stated, "Continue to make the greatest efforts to reach an agreement stipulating the issue of signing a broad disarmament treaty after the first-step treaty."

We agree with the American statement that a broad disarmament agreement must be reached.

Zorin said that the Soviet Union has always advocated a fundamental solution to the disarmament problem. A proposal we submitted to the Subcommittee on March 18 can serve as the basis for reaching a broad disarmament agreement. The Soviet Union will do everything in its power to achieve this agreement.

    佐林剥开美国裁军方案的皮
    重申苏联主张根本解决裁军问题
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社伦敦16日讯：苏联代表佐林7月15日在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会上批评了美国的裁军提案。
    他说，美国代表史塔生7月12日在小组委员会上综述了美国目前在原子武器和氢武器问题上所采取的态度，列举了美国同意实行的五点。可是，不难看出，这几点只不过是一些泛泛之谈，决不说明美国立场的实质。这次说明绝对无助于对澄清美国的立场、决不会有利于谋求彼此所能接受的协议。
    佐林接着就史塔生谈到的五点把美国和苏联的态度作了对比。他说，史塔生的第一点说：“停止试验”。美国建议停止试验十个月，这一点也不会妨碍根据已作好的计划进行定期试验，并且美国提出停止试验的前提是就其他裁军问题达成协议。而在解决这些问题的道路上由于西方国家所采取的立场还存在着很大的困难。
    苏联建议立即作出停止试验各种原子武器和氢武器两、三年并对此实行国际监督的决定，并且不使这个决定取决于其他裁军问题的解决。
    史塔生的第二点说，“停止生产炸弹”。大家知道，美国没有建议停止生产原子武器和氢武器。它在这个问题上的立场是，建议就将来停止生产军用裂变物质的问题达成协议。这里美国坚持各国有权用已经积聚起来的可分裂原子材料制造和改进原子武器。
    苏联建议停止生产各种类型的原子武器和氢武器，目的是使这个措施对消除原子战争威胁具有现实意义，并且应该在采取这个措施的同时完全禁止原子武器和氢武器，从各国军备中取消这种武器，销毁现在储存的所有这种武器。
    史塔生的第三点说：“开始把炸弹用于动力站之需”。美国建议逐步把可分裂物用于和平目的。而与此同时，它坚决拒绝从各国军备中完全取消原子武器和氢武器。
    苏联认为必须从各国军备中完全取消原子武器和氢武器。使裂变物质仅用于和平目的：原子能电力站和运输等等。
    史塔生的第四点说：“永远不用核武器对别国进行侵略”。美国建议如何解决这个问题，而苏联又是建议如何解决的呢？美国和其他西方国家拒绝承担不使用原子武器和氢武器的义务，他们为使用这种武器于军事目的而辩护，说它是主要的“威慑”武器。
    苏联建议各国现在就郑重保证不使用任何类型的原子武器和氢武器于军事目的。
    史塔生的第五点说：“继续尽最大的努力达成协议，规定在第一个步骤的条约以后签订广泛的裁军条约的问题”。
    我们同意美国关于必须达成广泛的裁军协议的声明。
    佐林说，苏联过去和现在一直主张根本解决裁军问题。我们在3月18日向小组委员会提出的一项建议可以作为达成广泛的裁军协议的基础。苏联这方面将尽一切力量争取达成这项协议。
