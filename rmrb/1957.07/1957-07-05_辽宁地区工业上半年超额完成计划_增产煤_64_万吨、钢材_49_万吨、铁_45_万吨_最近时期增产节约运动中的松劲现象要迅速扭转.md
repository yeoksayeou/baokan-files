Title: Liaoning Province Industry Exceeds First Half of Year Plan: Coal Production Up 640,000 Tons, Steel Up 490,000 Tons, Iron Up 450,000 Tons. The Laxity in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement Must Be Swiftly Reversed

　　Shenyang, July 2nd. This newspaper reports that the state-owned and local state-owned industries in the Liaoning area have performed very well in completing their production tasks for the first half of this year; however, in recent times, the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement has become somewhat lax, and many problems have emerged in production, which are worthy of vigilance.

　　According to estimates from the Liaoning Provincial Statistics Bureau, the total output value plan for state-owned industries can be exceeded by 2.4% in the first half of the year, an increase of more than 16% compared to the same period last year, including an increase in production of 640,000 tons of raw coal, 490,000 tons of steel, 450,000 tons of pig iron, 620,000 tons of coke, 180,000 tons of cement, and 971 metal-cutting machine tools. Other plans such as labor productivity, commodity product costs, profits turned over to the state, and variety have all been completed well. The total output value plan for local state-owned industries can also be exceeded by 5.9%, an increase of 25% compared to the same period last year.

　　In the first half of this year, the factories and mines here have achieved extremely significant results in saving raw materials. For example, the electromechanical industry in the Shenyang area saved 1.84 million yuan of metal materials from January to May due to improved processes and designs. Steel plants throughout the province saved 30,000 tons of coke in the first quarter. Three coal mines throughout the province saved more than 14,000 cubic meters of pit props in the first quarter. From January to May, more than 15,000 cubic meters of pit props were also recovered. According to incomplete statistics from local industries, in the first quarter of this year alone, more than 8,200 tons of scrap iron and more than 6,500 tons of scrap steel were collected, which played a significant role in alleviating the tension in steel supply.

　　Judging from the current trend, the momentum of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement here has declined somewhat in the second quarter. Recently, some enterprises have started the rectification movement, and many leading personnel are busy studying and handling contradictions among the people. They have rarely seriously concerned themselves with and inspected the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, and the drums of Increase Production and Practice Economy have subsided in most enterprises. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel Company was originally a unit with a relatively good Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, increasing production by more than 80,000 tons of steel, iron, and steel products from January to May, but due to relaxed leadership, the originally planned Increase Production and Practice Economy plan was not completed.

　　Product quality has also shown a downward trend. Although the overall quality of state-owned industrial products has improved compared to last year, the quality of some products has also declined in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. For example, the first-class product rate of seamless steel pipes fell from 97% in the first quarter to 93% in May, and the first-class product rate of glass fell from 92% in the first quarter to 70% in April. In the context of market supply falling short of demand, the tendency of local industries to focus only on quantity and disregard quality is rising again.

　　The new product trial production plan has also not been completed satisfactorily. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel Company planned to trial produce 88 new products this year, but only 14 were actually trial produced by the beginning of June, and 51 of them had not even been started. Equipment accidents are still numerous. According to statistics from state-owned industries in five cities including Shenyang from January to May, although the total number of accidents decreased by 30% compared to the same period last year, major equipment accidents increased by 14% compared to the same period last year, resulting in losses of 5 million yuan due to accidents.

    辽宁地区工业上半年超额完成计划
    增产煤64万吨、钢材49万吨、铁45万吨
    最近时期增产节约运动中的松劲现象要迅速扭转
    本报沈阳2日电　辽宁地区国营工业和地方国营工业今年上半年的生产任务完成得很好；但是近一时期以来，增产节约运动有些松劲，生产中出现了不少问题，是值得警惕的。
    据辽宁省统计局预计，国营工业总产值计划上半年可超额2.4％完成，较去年同期总产值增长16％多，计多生产原煤六十四万吨，钢材四十九万吨，生铁四十五万吨，焦炭六十二万吨，水泥十八万吨，金属切削机床九百七十一台。其它劳动生产率、商品产品成本、上缴利润、品种等计划都完成得较好。地方国营工业总产值计划也可超额5.9％完成，较去年同期总产值增长了25％。
    今年上半年这里的厂矿在节约原材料方面效果极为显著。如沈阳地区的机电工业，在1至5月中，由于改进工艺和设计，节约了一百八十四万元的金属材料。全省炼钢厂在第一季度就节约了焦炭三万吨。全省三个煤矿在一季度就节约坑木一万四千多立方公尺。1至5月，还回收坑木一万五千多立方公尺。地方工业据不完全统计，仅今年第一季度就收废铁八千二百多吨，废钢六千五百多吨，对缓和钢铁供应紧张情况起了很大作用。
    就目前的趋势来看，这里的增产节约运动第二季度劲头有些下降。最近以来，一部分企业开始了整风运动，许多领导人员忙于研究处理人民内部矛盾，对增产节约运动就很少认真过问和进行检查，大部企业增产节约的锣鼓都消沉下来了。如鞍钢原是增产节约开展较好的一个单位，1至5月增产了八万多吨钢、铁和钢材，但是由于放松了领导，原订的增产节约计划没有完成。
    产品质量也有下降趋势。国营工业产品总的虽比去年有所改进，但有些产品质量，二季度较一季度也有下降。如无缝钢管一级品率，由一季度的97％降到5月份的93％，玻璃一级品率由一季度的92％降低到4月份的70％。地方工业在市场供不应求的情况下，只顾数量不顾质量的倾向又在抬头。
    新产品试制计划完成得也不能令人满意。如鞍钢今年计划试制新产品八十八项，实际到6月上旬仅试制成了十四项，其中有五十一项根本未动手进行试制。设备事故仍然很多。据沈阳等五个市国营工业1至5月统计，事故的总次数虽较去年同期减少了30％，但重大设备事故却较去年同期增加14％，因事故造成的损失达五百万元。
