Shanxi Province Local Industry
	Completes Five-Year Total Output Value Plan Ahead of Schedule

(Our Dispatch) The total output value of all factories and mines under the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry included in the national plan was originally planned to be 1,491 million yuan during the first Five-Year Plan period. This plan has recently been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded.

Before 1953, these medium and small-sized factories and mines in Shanxi not only could not produce steel, steel products, drilling rigs, winches, transformers, coking equipment, mine cars and other products, but even wire nails and iron wire could not meet local needs. Now, these things can all be produced. In the past four and a half years, more than 70 new types of major products have been added, including many new agricultural tools popular with farmers, such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, mountain plows, cultivators, and five-row seeders. The output of Shanxi's famous Fenjiu and Zhuyeqing wines, as well as daily necessities such as bowls, plates, clothing and socks, has increased significantly, and the variety of designs and colors has also increased.

    山西省地方工业
    提前完成五年总产值计划
    本报讯　山西省工业厅所属列入国家计划的全部厂矿，原计划在第一个五年计划期间累积完成总产值十四亿九千一百多万元，最近这一计划已经提前超额完成。
    1953年以前，山西这些中、小型厂矿不但不能生产钢、钢材、钻探机、卷扬机、变压器、炼焦设备、矿车等产品，就连洋钉、铁丝也不能供应当地的需要。现在，这些东西都能生产了。四年半来，仅主要产品就增加了七十多种，其中还包括受到农民欢迎的双轮双铧犁、山地犁、中耕器、五行拌种机等许多新式农具。山西名贵的汾酒、竹叶青酒，以及日常生活用品——碗、碟、衣、袜等，产量都有很大增加，花色品种也越来越多。
