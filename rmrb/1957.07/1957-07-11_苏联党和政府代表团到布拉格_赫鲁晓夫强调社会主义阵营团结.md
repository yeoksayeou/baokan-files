Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 10th: The Soviet Party and Government delegation, invited to visit Czechoslovakia, arrived in Prague this morning by special train. Prague presented a scene of joy today. Buildings along the streets were covered with flags and huge welcome slogans. From early morning, the streets leading to the station were filled with welcoming crowds.

The special train of the Soviet delegation entered the station at exactly 9:00 AM. The distinguished guests were accompanied from the Soviet-Czechoslovak border city of Čierna nad Tisou to the capital by Czechoslovak Communist Party and government leaders Novotný, Kopecký, Hendrych, and David. They received grand welcomes along the way as they passed through cities such as Košice, Žilina, and Olomouc.

Present at the Prague station today to welcome the Soviet guests were Czechoslovak Communist Party and government leaders such as Ďuriš, Fierlinger, Široký, and Zápotocký.

President Zápotocký delivered a welcome speech to the guests. He said that the friendship between the Czechoslovak and Soviet peoples is not only the result of common traditions and common struggles in the past, but also the main part and condition of our building socialism and guaranteeing our peaceful life.

The President continued, "The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, filled with the creative spirit of Leninism, gave people a powerful inspiring force to further expand the revolutionary movement throughout the world. The June meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union showed that the fraternal Communist Party of the Soviet Union consistently adheres to the conclusions of the 20th Congress; all attempts to divert the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from the path it has taken, to weaken its unity, and to change its Leninist policies are extremely foolish and desperate."

Zápotocký concluded by expressing his belief that the visit of the Soviet delegation to Czechoslovakia will greatly contribute to the further comprehensive development of the unbreakable friendship and alliance between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev then delivered a reply speech. He said that the working people of Czechoslovakia, united in the National Front with the Communist Party as the leading force and core, have made brilliant achievements in socialist construction and in consolidating the people's democratic system.

Khrushchev said that your achievements, like the achievements of other countries in the socialist camp, cannot but arouse the frantic hatred of imperialist reactionaries. The Hungarian incident clearly demonstrated the essence of the imperialist conspiracy. Our enemies are doing their utmost to undermine the unity of socialist countries, divide them, and then defeat them one by one, overthrowing the people's democratic system. As long as we join hands, as long as the entire socialist camp acts in unity, we will not fear any conspiracies of the enemies of socialism, the enemies of peace.

Khrushchev pointed out that the policy pursued by the imperialists is to deepen the division of Europe and establish military blocs in order to prevent the realization of Pan-European cooperation and the establishment of a solid peace.

Khrushchev said that we must strengthen the struggle to stop the arms race, to stop the production and use of thermonuclear weapons, and to stop the testing of such weapons.

### 苏联党和政府代表团到布拉格  赫鲁晓夫强调社会主义阵营团结

    苏联党和政府代表团到布拉格
    赫鲁晓夫强调社会主义阵营团结
    据新华社布拉格10日电　应邀到捷克斯洛伐克访问的苏联党和政府代表团今天上午乘专车到达布拉格。布拉格今天呈现出一片欢乐景象。各街道的建筑物上挂满了旗帜和巨幅的欢迎标语。在通往车站的街道上从清晨起就挤满了欢迎的人群。
    苏联代表团的专车在正九点钟进入车站。贵宾们是由捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府领导人诺沃提尼、柯别茨基、亨德里赫和戴维等从苏捷边境城市切尔纳陪同来到首都的。他们一路上在经过科息斯、日利纳、阿罗木茨等城市的时候，都受到了盛大的欢迎。
    今天到布拉格车站欢迎苏联客人的有捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的领导人杜兰斯基、费林格、西罗基、萨波托斯基等人。
    萨波托斯基总统向客人们致了欢迎词。他说，捷苏两国人民之间的友谊不仅是过去共同的传统和共同的斗争的结果，同时也是我们建设社会主义和保证我们国家的和平生活的主要部分和条件。
    总统继续说，“充满着创造性的列宁主义精神的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会给了人们以有力的鼓舞力量来进一步扩大全世界的革命运动。苏联共产党中央委员会在6月举行的会议表明，兄弟般的苏联共产党执行第二十次代表大会的结论是多末坚持一贯；企图使苏联共产党离开它所采取的道路、企图削弱它的团结和改变它的列宁主义政策的一切尝试是多末愚蠢和绝望。”
    萨波托斯基最后表示相信苏联代表团到捷克斯洛伐克来访问将大大有助于进一步全面发展捷苏两国之间的牢不可破的友谊和同盟。
    赫鲁晓夫接着致答词。他说，捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民团结在以共产党为主导力量和核心的民族阵线中，在社会主义建设以及巩固人民民主制度方面取得了辉煌的成就。
    赫鲁晓夫说，你们的成就像社会主义阵营其他国家的成就一样，不能不引起帝国主义反动派的疯狂的仇恨。匈牙利事件清楚地表明了帝国主义阴谋的实质。我们的敌人极力想破坏社会主义国家的团结，分裂它们，然后把它们各个击破，把人民民主制度推翻。只要我们手挽手，只要整个社会主义阵营团结一致地行动，我们就不怕社会主义的敌人、和平的敌人的任何阴谋。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，帝国主义者坚持的方针是加深欧洲的分裂、建立军事集团，以便阻止实现全欧合作和确立巩固和平的主张。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们必须加强争取停止军备竞赛、争取停止生产和使用热核武器、争取停止试验这种武器的斗争。
