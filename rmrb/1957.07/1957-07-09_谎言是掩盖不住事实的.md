    Lies Cannot Conceal the Truth
    Rightist elements say, "The present is not as good as the past," and "Emphasis on achievements is 'dogmatism'." But lies cannot conceal the truth.
    Take industrial construction alone. This year, the central industrial departments alone have 478 major factory and mine projects under construction simultaneously, of which 175 will be completed this year.
    From these pictures, we can also see the atmosphere and face of some large-scale construction. (Attached pictures)

    The renovation and expansion project of Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant has started in full swing. After the completion of all the projects in 1960, the production capacity will be five times higher than it is now, and it will be able to manufacture a large number of all-steel freight cars with high efficiency and a load capacity of 90-120 tons. This is the construction site of the steel casting workshop under expansion.

    右派分子说：“现在不如过去”，“讲成绩是主要的，便是‘教条主义’”。但是谎言是掩盖不住事实的。
    单就工业建设来说吧。今年，仅中央各工业部门就有四百七十八项大厂矿工程同时进行建设，其中有一百七十五项工程将在今年建设完成。
    从这些画面上，我们也可以看到一些大规模建设的气氛和面貌。（附图片）

    齐齐哈尔车辆制造厂的改建和扩建工程全面动工了。到1960年全部工程竣工以后，生产能力将比现在提高五倍，而且能够大量制造效率高、载重量达90—120吨的全钢货车。这是扩建中的铸钢车间工地。
