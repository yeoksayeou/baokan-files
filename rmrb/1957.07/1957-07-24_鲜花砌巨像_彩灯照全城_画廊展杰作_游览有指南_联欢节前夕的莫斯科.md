Gardeners at Moscow's Gorky Central Park of Culture and Rest, under the direction of artist Belyaev and horticultural engineer Lazareva, are meticulously "painting" two magnificent artistic masterpieces: a huge commemorative picture of "Lenin on the Rostrum" made of flowers, and a huge statue of Gorky made of flowers. The commemorative picture covers an area of approximately 250 square meters and is 40 meters wide. This picture can be seen from a great distance – even from Lenin Square.

More than 200 squares, streets, bridges, gardens, and boulevards in Moscow will be decorated with colorful and dazzling festive lights during the festival. The colored lights will consist of more than 1.5 million light bulbs and 3,000 searchlights. To install these lights, approximately 1,000 kilometers of wire and more than 40,000 meters of cable will be used. These lights will require a total of 8,000 kilowatts of electricity, which is equivalent to the electricity needed to illuminate a medium-sized city.

The famous Moscow State Tretyakov Gallery is preparing to welcome participants of the festival. During the festival, it will hold an exhibition of the works of the great Russian painter Repin. The exhibition will provide explanatory notes for visitors, explaining the important works. The gallery will also publish a guidebook to the entire gallery in Russian and other languages.

Under the leadership of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Youth League, various districts of Moscow and grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League have launched a socialist competition to decorate and green the capital. The winners of the competition, those units and individuals with a large number of workdays, a large number of flowers and plants planted, and exquisite and innovative decoration and greening work, will receive a variety of prizes. The Communist Youth League district committee that does the most outstanding decoration and greening work will receive a "Volga" car. Prizes for individuals include watches, cameras, ice skates, and tickets to the opening ceremony of the festival.

To facilitate visitors' tours of the vast and beautiful Moscow, the Geographical Publishing House has specially published a beautifully decorated tourist guide on the eve of the festival. This tourist guide is accompanied by a colored map of Moscow, with important places of interest marked on the route map.

    画廊展杰作　游览有指南
    联欢节前夕的莫斯科
    莫斯科高尔基中央文化休息公园的园丁们在装饰美术家别利亚耶夫和园艺工程师拉扎列娃领导下，正在精心“绘制”两幅瑰丽的艺术杰作——一幅是鲜花组成的巨大的纪念画“列宁在讲台上”，另一幅是鲜花组成的巨大的高尔基像。纪念画的面积约有二百五十平方公尺，宽达四十公尺。这幅画在很远的地方——从列宁广场都可以看到。
    莫斯科二百多个广场、街道、桥梁、街心花园、林荫大道在联欢节期间将装上五颜六色、光采夺目的节日彩灯。彩灯将由一百五十多万个灯泡和三千个探照灯组成。为了安装这些彩灯，还将使用一千公里左右的电线和四万多公尺电缆。这些彩灯一共需要一个八千瓩的发电机供应电力，也就是说，相当一个中等城市照明所需的电力。
    著名的莫斯科国立特列季亚科夫画廊正在准备迎接联欢节的参加者。在联欢节期间，它将举行伟大俄罗斯画家列宾的作品展览会。展览会将备有参观说明书，解释重要的作品。画廊还要用俄文和其他国家文字出版一本整个画廊的参观指南。
    莫斯科各区和共青团基层组织在共青团莫斯科市委会领导下展开了布置和绿化首都的社会主义竞赛。竞赛的优胜者，是工作日数量多、种植花草的数量多、布置和绿化工作精致新颖的单位和个人，他们可以得到多种奖品。布置和绿化工作做得最出色的共青团区委会将获得一辆“伏尔加”牌小轿车。奖给个人的奖品有表，照像机，冰鞋和参加联欢节开幕式的入场券等。
    为了便利客人游览巨大而美丽的莫斯科，地理出版社特地在联欢节前夕出版了一本装璜精美的游览指南，这本游览指南附有彩色的莫斯科简图，在路线图上注明了重要的名胜古迹等。
