Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 26th July: A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on July 25th that the Syrian government "strongly condemns the British government's brutal act of bombing the peaceful residents of Omani cities and villages" and considers this British armed intervention to be a "blatant aggression against an independent Arab country."

The spokesman also said that the Syrian government pays tribute to the heroic Omani nationalists and their leader, Imam Ghalib bin Ali. He said that the Syrian government is closely watching the "Omani liberation movement" and "is studying all means with other Arab sister countries to ensure Oman's independence and to deal with British aggression." The spokesman said that the Syrian government believes that the Arab people of Oman will surely defeat the imperialists and gain their independence and sovereignty.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 26th July: A spokesman for the Omani Imam's office in Cairo said on July 25th that the Omani Imam, Ghalib bin Ali, has rejected the Sultan of Muscat's proposal for a ceasefire and demanded that British troops and oil exploration teams withdraw from Oman and that the Sultan of Muscat abdicate.

The spokesman said that the Sultan of Muscat's envoy who was sent to request a ceasefire and a British officer accompanying him were returning after meeting with the Omani Imam when their car was blown up. The Sultan of Muscat's envoy was killed, and the British officer was seriously wounded in the leg. He said that the British authorities have sent the officer to a hospital in Aden.

The spokesman said that the armed insurgents in Oman have received the moral support of the governments of several Arab countries.

According to Western news agencies, the British Foreign Office denied the news regarding the Sultan of Muscat's request for a ceasefire on the same day.

Xinhua News Agency, July 26th: London dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd admitted in the House of Commons on July 25th that British ground forces are being transported into the Persian Gulf to suppress the Omani rebellious tribes. He reiterated that the British Air Force is already engaged in combat there.

In response to a question from former Labour Minister Shinwell, Lloyd said that it was untrue that British oil interests were directly related to the Oman incident.

Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, Bevan, pressed Lloyd, asking: Where did the rebellious tribes get their weapons? Why is Britain aiding the Sultan of Muscat?

Lloyd avoided answering directly. He only said that British aid to the Sultan of Muscat was not based on a treaty. He also said that the policies of both Britain and the United States are not to expand the Oman incident.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 26th July: "Al-Akhbar" said on the 25th that the current situation in Oman has two aspects: "The first aspect is that a nation wants to get rid of foreign rule. The second aspect is the Anglo-American contention for this oil-rich region."

The newspaper said in an editorial: "The Muscat incident is an incident of imperialism wanting to rule other countries. The Sultan of Muscat is protected by the British, who want those tribal people who have declared resistance to foreign rule to submit to this Sultan."

The newspaper pointed out that oil is the reason for Britain's efforts to control Muscat. The United States is unhappy with Britain's unilateral action to rule the Sultanate of Muscat and is trying to destroy British influence there.

The newspaper concluded that imperialists are jackals of the same lair. This is the reason why some newspapers in the West, such as the American "Boston Globe," even call for Anglo-American cooperation on this matter.

    叙利亚严斥英国侵略阿曼  阿曼教长要英国军队滚开
    劳埃德承认英地面部队正向阿曼进侵
    新华社大马士革26日电　叙利亚外交部发言人7月25日说，叙利亚政府“强烈谴责英国政府轰炸阿曼城市和乡村的和平居民的残暴行动”，并且认为英国这种武装干涉是“公然侵略一个独立的阿拉伯国家”。
    这位发言人还说，叙利亚政府向英勇的阿曼民族主义者及其领袖加勒布·阿里教长致敬。他说，叙利亚政府正在密切注意“阿曼解放运动”，并且“正在和其它阿拉伯姊妹国家研究一切办法来保障阿曼的独立，并且对付英国的侵略行动”。发言人说，叙利亚政府相信阿曼的阿拉伯人民必将战胜帝国主义者，并且获得它们的独立和主权。
    新华社开罗26日电　阿曼教长驻开罗办事处发言人7月25日说，阿曼教长加勒布·阿里已经拒绝了马斯喀特苏丹要求停火的建议，并且要求英国的军队和石油勘探队退出阿曼，马斯喀特苏丹退位。
    发言人说，马斯喀特苏丹派遣的要求停火的使者和陪同他的一个英国军官，在会见阿曼教长以后回去的路上，车子被炸坏，马斯喀特苏丹的使者身死，英国军官腿部受重伤。他说，英国当局已经把这个军官送到亚丁的医院去。
    发言人说，阿曼的武装起义者受到好几个阿拉伯国家的政府的道义支持。
    据西方通讯社报道，英国外交部在同一天否认了关于马斯喀特苏丹要求停火的消息。
    新华社26日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德7月25日在下院承认，英国地面部队正在运入波斯湾，以镇压阿曼起义部落。他再次宣布英国空军已经在那里投入战斗。
    劳埃德在回答前工党大臣辛威尔的问题时说，否认英国的石油利益跟这次阿曼事件直接有关。
    工党外交问题发言人比万追问劳埃德：起义部落的武器是从哪里来的？英国为什么要援助马斯喀特苏丹？
    劳埃德避免正面回答，他只说，英国援助马斯喀特苏丹不是根据条约。他还说，英国和美国的政策都是不要扩大阿曼事件。
    新华社开罗26日电　“消息报”25日说，阿曼目前的局势有两个方面：“第一个方面是，一个民族希望摆脱外国的统治。第二个方面是，英美争夺这个盛产石油的地区。”
    这家报纸在社论中说：“马斯喀特事件是帝国主义想统治别的国家的事件。马斯喀特苏丹受到英国人的保护，他们要那些宣布反抗外国统治的部族人民向这个苏丹屈服。”
    这家报纸指出，石油是英国努力控制马斯喀特的原因。美国对英国单独采取行动来统治马斯喀特苏丹国的做法感到不快，它企图摧毁英国在那里的势力。
    这家报纸最后说，帝国主义是一丘之貉。这就是西方的某些报纸，例如美国的“波士顿环球报”甚至要求英美在这件事情上合作的原因。
