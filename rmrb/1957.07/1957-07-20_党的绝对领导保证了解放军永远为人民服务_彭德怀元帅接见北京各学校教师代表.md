    党的绝对领导保证了解放军永远为人民服务
    彭德怀元帅接见北京各学校教师代表
    新华社19日讯  国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅，今天上午接见了北京市各学校和幼儿园的二十多名教师代表。这次接见是彭德怀元帅应北京市教育界为纪念“八一”建军三十周年而要求举行的。
    彭德怀元帅兴致勃勃地和教师们交谈了三个多小时。他向教师们介绍了人民解放军在各次革命战争中的艰苦斗争事迹和光荣传统，并且十分强调无产阶级政党——共产党领导人民军队的绝对必要性。他说，有了共产党对军队的绝对领导，中国人民解放军这支人民军队从成立到现在以至将来，都永远为人民服务，而不会变质。教育工作者陶淑范、杜怡芳等人在发言中希望军队不断有人到学校去讲革命斗争故事。彭德怀元帅接受教师们的这个要求。最后，教师们向彭德怀元帅赠送了小学生们自作的玩具和绘画等礼品。
