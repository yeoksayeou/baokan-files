Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 16th. Thai newspapers report that the spokesperson of the Socialist United Front of Thailand, Member of Parliament Nai Khlai Narapathi, and another Member of Parliament, Nai Sawang Datchu, jointly submitted an emergency proposal to the parliament on the 11th, requesting the parliament to establish a committee composed of representatives from various political parties to be responsible for investigating and studying how and why the government is implementing a foreign policy that follows the United States.

Prior to this, Nai Khlai had accused the United States at a press conference on the 10th of intensifying its interference in Thailand's internal affairs. He said that American "experts" controlled various Thai government departments like a spider web. Thailand is facing a serious threat from foreign imperialism. He demanded that the Thai government break free from the shackles of military agreements and adopt an independent and autonomous foreign policy.

At the press conference, Nai Khlai also advocated for the formation of a coalition government composed of various Thai political parties and patriotic independent politicians to prevent the crisis caused by imperialist interference.

The "Eternal Daily" published an editorial on the 11th entitled "Foreign Interference," stating that as the Thai people's determination to oppose imperialism becomes increasingly firm, foreign imperialism has adopted the tactic of creating divisions within Thailand's ruling groups, especially among those groups with real power. The newspaper called on the government to prevent the harm caused by foreign imperialism and to quickly and resolutely stop sowing discord.

The "Free Communications Daily" editorial on the 12th pointed out that the vast majority of the Thai people demand that the government change its policy, implement a neutral policy based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, break free from American constraints, and not act as an accomplice to imperialism in launching wars. The editorial emphasized that Thailand's complete alignment with the Western camp would only cause damage in all aspects.

    泰国社会主义联合阵线发言人
    要求摆脱美国转向独立
    揭露美国“专家”控制政府各部门
    新华社16日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，泰国社会主义联合阵线发言人、议员乃克莱·纳拉帕蒂和另一位议员乃沙旺·达趋在11日联名向议会提出一项紧急建议，要求议会成立一个由各个政党的代表组成的委员会，来负责调查和研究政府怎样实行和为什么要实行追随美国的外交政策。
    在此以前，乃克莱曾经在10日的记者招待会上指责美国正在加紧干涉泰国的内政，他说，美国的“专家”像蜘蛛网一样控制了泰国各个政府部门。泰国正面临着外国帝国主义的严重威胁。他要求泰国政府摆脱军事协定的束缚，转而采取独立自主的外交政策。
    乃克莱在这次记者招待会上还主张由泰国各个政党和爱国的独立政治家组成联合政府，以便制止由帝国主义干涉所引起的危机。
    “永恒报”11日发表题为“外国干涉”的社论说，在泰国人民反对帝国主义的意志日益坚决的情况下，外国帝国主义采取了在泰国统治集团内部，特别是在拥有实力的集团中制造分裂的手段。这家报纸要求政府防止外国帝国主义对泰国的危害，迅速和坚决地制止挑拨离间。
    “自由通讯报”12日的社论指出，泰国广大人民要求政府改变政策，实行五项原则的中立政策，摆脱美国束缚，不要充当帝国主义发动战争的助手。社论强调说，泰国把自己完全和西方阵营联系在一起，只会使自己在各方面遭受损害。
