Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 27th: The Shenzhen Border Public Security Bureau of Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, announced today: The Kuomintang secret service agency's plot to blow up the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day has been exposed. The fisherman, Wu Guang, who was lured and then coerced by the Kuomintang secret service agency in Hong Kong to return to carry out this bombing mission, surrendered himself to the local public security authorities on the 25th, handing over explosives and blasting equipment, and expressing his repentance to the motherland and the people.

The People's Committee of Bao'an County, Guangdong Province, also announced today that it would not pursue any charges against Wu Guang, and praised his actions of voluntarily surrendering himself, handing over the explosives, and preventing damage to state property and the loss of people's lives, and also awarded him a bonus.

Wu Guang lives in the Shenzhen border area and is an old fisherman. Not long ago, Wu Guang went to the Kowloon area. After being repeatedly lured and coerced by the Hong Kong Kuomintang secret service agency, he was given a package of American-made high-grade high explosives weighing one and a half kilograms to take back to Shenzhen, ordering Wu Guang to blow up the railway and trains near Shenzhen on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the army on "August 1st".

After Wu Guang returned to Shenzhen with the explosives, he deeply regretted being deceived by the Kuomintang secret service agency, felt that he must never do such a thing that betrays the motherland and endangers the people, and finally surrendered himself to the local public security authorities.

At a mass rally held in Shenzhen today by the Bao'an County People's Committee to announce the above decision, Wu Guang expressed his repentance to more than a thousand villagers and thanked the government for its leniency towards him.

    国民党特务企图爆破广州深圳路的阴谋败露
    新华社广州27日电　广东省宝安县深圳边防公安机关今天宣布：国民党特务机关企图在“八一”建军节三十周年纪念日前夕爆炸广州—深圳铁路的阴谋，已经败露。被香港地区的国民党特务机关诱骗后又胁迫他回来执行这项爆炸任务的渔民吴广，在25日向当地公安机关投案自首，交出了炸药和爆破器材，表示向祖国和人民悔罪。
    广东省宝安县人民委员会也已在今天宣布对吴广不加任何追究，并且对他自动投案，交出炸药，免致国家财产和人民生命遭受损害的行动予以表扬，还发给他一笔奖金。
    吴广家居深圳边防地区，是一个老渔民。不久前，吴广去九龙地区。香港国民党特务机关对他多方面的诱骗和胁迫以后，交了一包重达一公斤半的美国制造的高级烈性炸药给吴广带回深圳，要吴广在祖国人民欢庆“八一”建军节三十周年纪念日前夕，爆炸深圳附近的铁道和火车。
    吴广带着炸药回到深圳后，深悔自己受国民党特务机关的欺骗，感到绝不能干这种背叛祖国和危害人民的事情，终于向当地公安机关自首。
    吴广今天在宝安县人民委员会为宣布上项决定而在深圳举行的群众大会上，向一千多乡亲表示悔过，并且感激政府对他的宽大处理。
