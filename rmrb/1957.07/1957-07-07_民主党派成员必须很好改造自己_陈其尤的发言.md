Democratic Party Members Must Vigorously Remold Themselves
Chen Qiyou's Speech

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports on national work by other responsible comrades, as well as Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Since the Third Session last year, within a year, our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government, has continued its victorious advance, enabling the socialist revolution to achieve a fundamental victory, and socialist construction to achieve tremendous success. 1956 was a year of the greatest natural disasters in decades, yet in that year, the total industrial output value had already completed the first Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule and exceeded it by 9.5 percent; the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries completed 96 percent of the plan, an increase of 4.9 percent over the previous year, with the total grain output alone reaching 365 billion catties, an increase of 15.4 billion catties over the previous year; other construction has also had great growth. The acquisition of this astonishing achievement is inseparable from the entire national policy of implementing the people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the Communist Party and resolutely taking the socialist road.

May I ask, in the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, could it have been possible to achieve a grain production (excluding soybeans) of 365 billion catties and a cotton production of 22 million dan in just seven or eight years? Could we have independently manufactured jet aircraft, heavy-duty trucks, large-scale power generation equipment, and single-axis automatic lathes, and other important new products? Could we have trained 280,000 college graduates in five years? Could there have been today’s glorious achievements in any other construction endeavors? As for the achievements in national political life and international affairs, it goes without saying that they are incomparable to those of old China. These great achievements are well-known facts, which even our enemies cannot deny. Anyone with patriotic enthusiasm is encouraged by these achievements.

However, just as all of us delegates are about to gather at this Fourth Session to jointly summarize our country’s successful experiences over the past year and prepare to move further forward, a few right-wing elements who are people's representatives, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping, Huang Shaohong, Long Yun... and their followers, took advantage of the opportunity that the Communist Party invited democratic parties to assist the Communist Party in carrying out rectification, to reverse right and wrong, exaggerate deviations, and describe the great achievements of our country in all aspects as full of errors and completely dark. We must severely criticize them: (1) Our country's basic system is the socialist system, which is based on the specific historical conditions and international environment of our country, led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the worker-peasant alliance's people's democratic dictatorship. In our country, all power belongs to the people, and the National People's Congress is the organ for the people to exercise power. In addition to the people's congresses at all levels, there are also political consultative conferences at all levels composed of people from various parties, non-party democrats, and people from various people's organizations to assist the government in its work. In all these institutions, the Communists do not account for a majority, and often only account for about one-third. May I ask, is there a system more democratic and more suitable to the actual situation than this? However, the rightists say that this is a "Party-dominated world," that "a two-chamber system" is needed for democracy, or that the Party should not issue orders to the masses, which only shows that their purpose is to oppose the Party's leadership, oppose socialist democracy, and try to drag our country back to the dead end of capitalism. (2) The Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement is necessary to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, otherwise it will not be possible to guarantee the safety of our country's construction and the people's lives and property. In the past, we had great achievements in the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement. Precisely because of this, our social order is good, and our country can carry out construction peacefully. However, the rightists exaggerate the individual and local shortcomings in the movement, speak up for counter-revolutionaries, and describe the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as having extremely many deviations and being worthless, thus advocating the establishment of a rehabilitation committee to re-try the cases. Does this not show that their words reflect the emotions of the overthrown reactionary class? (3) The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and industrialists and businessmen was originally one of the main links in socialist transformation. Enterprises after joint state-private ownership must be operated and managed in accordance with socialist principles, and private personnel must be further transformed. However, the rightists say that the public representatives of joint state-private enterprises should withdraw, that the working class has nothing to learn, that industrialists and businessmen no longer have two sides and do not need to be transformed, and they also advocate extending the fixed interest to twenty years, and even say that taking fixed interest is not exploitation. What does this mean? This means that the rightists still want to retain and restore the capitalist economic foundation in joint ventures and resist socialist transformation. (4) They wantonly obliterate all the achievements of our country, and even ridicule that the two sentences "achievements are basic, deviations and mistakes are individual" are "dogmatism" and "new stereotypes." May I ask the rightists: What are your intentions? Are you not trying to negate the socialist system by negating the achievements? (5) Some people say that the people's lives after liberation are not as good as before liberation, and that socialism plus bureaucracy is worse than capitalism. Facts prove that they are talking nonsense with their eyes open. They want to use this to provoke the unity between the people and the Party and the government, so as to achieve their ulterior motives. (6) As for those who make public anti-Soviet remarks and deny the status of minority nationalities, their purpose is also very obvious in undermining the unity of the international socialist camp and the unity of various nationalities in the country.

Although all these fallacies are expressed in different forms, the purpose of the speakers is nothing more than to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose the people's democratic dictatorship, and finally oppose socialism. In other words, they want to drag New China back to the old road of semi-feudal and semi-colonialism before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It is not without reason that their remarks are praised by the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and the US government.

Of course, some of our country's work and our country's staff also have shortcomings, but these are only individual phenomena and contradictions among the people, which we can gradually improve and resolve through various democratic means. Chairman Mao's instructions on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the CPC Central Committee's rectification movement for the Party are all measures to actively improve the country's work. These right-wing elements want to use these internal contradictions to achieve their long-standing goal of opposing the Communist Party and the people and thus satisfy their personal political ambitions. Their intentions are obvious, and at the same time, they show their arrogance and ignorance. They do not understand that the Chinese people today will never go back to living under the cruel oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. On the contrary, if anyone wants them to go back, they will resolutely smash this conspiracy. The counterattack against the right-wing elements by the people in various places for more than a month is clear evidence.

Most of the leaders of the right-wing elements are senior cadres of democratic parties and responsible persons of state organs, and they have done such arrogant things, which shows that class struggle in our country is still very sharp, and shows that members of democratic parties (including responsible persons) must still vigorously study and remold themselves. I hope that after being criticized by the people of the whole country, they can follow the path indicated to them in Premier Zhou's report, repent as soon as possible, and thoroughly confess to the people, in order to be forgiven by the people. They should not think that they are smart and can muddle through.

I will definitely, as always, wholeheartedly engage in my work under the leadership of the Communist Party, and take the six principles indicated by Chairman Mao in his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" as the standard for judging our words and actions, conduct a thorough rectification within the Zhi Gong Party and assist the Chinese Communist Party in carrying out rectification.

We will forever advance under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party!

    民主党派成员必须很好改造自己
    陈其尤的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和其他几位负责人关于国家工作的报告，以及彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告。
    从去年第三次会议以来，一年之内，我们国家在共产党和政府的领导之下，继续以前的胜利前进，使社会主义革命已经取得了基本胜利，社会主义建设获得巨大成绩。一九五六年是几十年来自然灾害最大的一年，然而就在这一年里，工业总产值已经提前一年并超额完成了第一个五年计划的百分之九点五；农业和农副业的总产值完成了计划的百分之九十六，比上年增长百分之四点九，单是粮食总产量就达到了三千六百五十亿斤，比上年增加了一百五十四亿斤；其他建设亦都有了很大的增长。这种惊人的成绩的获得，是与在共产党的领导之下实施人民民主专政、坚决走社会主义道路的整个国策分不开的。
    试问在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，能够在短短七、八年中做到粮食年产量（不包括大豆）达到三千六百五十亿斤，棉花年产量达到二千二百万担的成绩吗？能够自制成喷气式飞机、载重汽车、大型发电设备和单轴自动车床等重要新产品吗？能够在五年之内培养出二十八万高等学校毕业生吗？能够在其他任何建设事业上有今天辉煌的成就吗？至于在国家政治生活上和国际事务上的成就，更不用说是旧中国所不能比拟的。这些伟大的成就，是尽人皆知的事实，连我们的敌人也不能否认。任何具有爱国热忱的人，都为这些成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    然而，正当我们全体代表将要聚集在这个第四次会议上，共同总结我们国家一年来的成功经验准备进一步向前迈进的前夕，竟有少数身为人民代表的右派分子如章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平、黄绍竑、龙云……等及其附从者们，利用共产党邀请民主党派协助共产党进行整风的机会，颠倒是非，夸大偏差，把我们国家在各方面的伟大成绩说成错误百出、黑漆一团。我们必须予以严正批驳：（一）我们国家的基本制度是社会主义制度，这就是根据我国特定的历史条件和国际环境而产生的，以工人阶级（通过共产党而领导）为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政制度。在我们国家里，一切权力属于人民，而全国人民代表大会是人民行使权力的机关。在各级人民代表大会之外，还有由各党派人士、无党派民主人士和各人民团体人士所组成的各级政治协商会议，协助政府工作。在所有这些机构里，共产党人都没有占多数，且常常只在三分之一左右。试问还有比这种制度更民主、更适合于实际情况的吗？但是右派分子却说这是“党天下”，说要“两院制”才民主，或者说党不要向群众发号施令，这只是表明他们的目的在反对党的领导、反对社会主义民主，想把我国拖回资本主义的死路上去。（二）肃反运动是巩固人民民主专政所必需的，否则就不能保证我们国家建设和人民生命财产的安全。过去我们在肃反运动上有伟大的成绩，正因如此，我们的社会秩序良好，我们国家才得以平安地进行建设。然而右派分子却夸大运动中个别的、局部的缺点，替反革命分子喊冤，把肃反说成偏差极多一无是处的事情，从而主张另行成立平反委员会重新审判，难道这不是表明他们的话反映了被推翻的反动阶级的情绪么？（三）对资本主义工商业和工商业者的改造，原是社会主义改造的主要环节之一。公私合营以后的企业必须按照社会主义的原则进行经营管理，私方人员必须进一步受到改造。然而右派分子却说公私合营企业的公方代表应当退出，说工人阶级没有什么可学的，说工商业者已经没有两面性，无须改造，并且还主张延长定息到二十年，甚至说拿定息不是剥削。这是什么意思呢？这就是说右派分子仍然想在合营企业中保留和恢复资本主义的经济基础，抗拒社会主义改造。（四）他们对我们国家的一切成就都肆意抹煞，竟嘲笑说“成绩是基本的，偏差和错误是个别的”这二句话是“教条主义”、“新八股”。试问右派分子：你们的居心何在？难道你们不是企图从否定成绩来否定社会主义制度么？（五）有人说，解放以后人民的生活比解放以前还不如，说社会主义加官僚主义比资本主义还坏。事实证明他们是睁着眼睛说胡话。他们是想借此挑拨人民和党与政府的团结，达到自己不可告人的目的。（六）至于那些发出公开反苏和否认少数民族的地位的言论的人，其目的在破坏国际社会主义阵营的团结和国内各民族的团结，也是很明显的。
    所有这些谬论，虽然表达的形式不同，然而说话的人的目的不外是反对共产党领导、反对人民民主专政，最后反对社会主义。换言之，他们是要把新中国拖回到一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以前半封建半殖民地的老路上去。他们的言论得到台湾蒋介石集团和美国政府的赞扬，并不是没有原因的。
    诚然，我们的国家工作和我们的国家工作人员有些亦是有缺点的，但是这些都只是个别现象和人民内部的矛盾，我们可以通过各种民主方式逐步改进和解决。毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示，中共中央对党的整风运动，都是积极改进国家工作的措施。这些右派分子却想利用这些内部矛盾，达到他们多年来反共反人民从而满足个人政治野心的目的，他们的居心何在不问可知，同时也表现了他们的猖狂和愚昧。他们不了解今天的中国人民，无论如何是不会重新走回到被帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义残酷压迫和剥削之下去生活的，相反地，倘有人要他们这样走回头路，他们一定要坚决粉碎这种阴谋的。一个多月来，各地人民对右派分子的反击，就是明证。
    右派分子的首领多数是民主党派的高级干部和国家机关的负责人，竟会做出这种狂妄的事来，这说明我国阶级斗争仍然是很尖锐的，说明民主党派成员（包括负责人在内）仍必须很好地进行学习，改造自己。我希望他们在受到全国人民的指责之后，能遵照周总理的报告对他们所指示的道路，早日幡然悔悟，彻底向人民交代，以期为人民所宽恕。他们不要以为自己聪明可以瞒混过去。
    我一定本着向来全心全意在共产党的领导下，从事我的工作，并以毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”一文中所指示的六条原则作为判断我们的言论和行动的标准，在致公党内进行彻底的整风并协助中国共产党进行整风。
    我们永远在中国共产党的领导下前进！
