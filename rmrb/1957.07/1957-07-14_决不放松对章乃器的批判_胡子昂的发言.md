I completely agree with Premier Zhou's government work report and other reports of the conference.

In his report, Premier Zhou used many concrete figures and vivid examples to illustrate the great achievements our country has made on all fronts in the past few years since liberation. The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has been basically completed nationwide. This is a socialist revolution that has transformed the private ownership of the means of production, which has existed for thousands of years, into public ownership. Who can say that these tremendous achievements were not due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government? The total industrial output value of our country increased by 17.7 billion yuan in the first three years of the Five-Year Plan, and by 13.9 billion yuan last year alone, completing and exceeding the targets for the final year of the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. The initial foundation for China's industrialization has been established. Is this not because the Party and the government correctly planned the steps for combining construction and transformation, enabling our country's socialist construction to achieve such a leap forward in development? Last year, our country suffered the worst natural disaster in recent decades, with 230 million mu of farmland affected and 70 million people affected. However, the total agricultural output value still increased by 2.74 billion yuan compared to 1955, and the total grain output even exceeded the Five-Year Plan. Is this not because of the active leadership and support of the Party and the government, and the superiority of the socialist system, which can withstand such severe disasters? The living standards of farmers, who account for more than 80 percent of China's population, have risen year by year since liberation. Last year alone, the purchasing power of farmers nationwide rose to 19.1 billion yuan, an increase of 136 percent compared to 1950. In seven years, the state has solved the employment problem for 13 million people, and the wages of workers and staff nationwide have increased by nearly 37 percent in the past four years. These are all unprecedented in Chinese history. Is it not because, under the leadership of the Party and the government, we chose the socialist path that the people of the whole country can have such a life today?

Those of us who have lived through the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang will never forget the situation at that time, especially when Chiang Kai-shek regarded Chongqing as his last stronghold. Bandits roamed rampant, robbing people in broad daylight, setting fire and looting at Chaotianmen, and secret agents drove people into the water. The four major families, on the one hand, sent planes from Hong Kong to transport gold yuan and silver yuan to buy up gold and U.S. dollars, and on the other hand, searched door-to-door for gold and silver jewelry. What a terrible era that world of cannibalism was! The reactionary regime never talked about construction. Chiang Kai-shek ruled for decades, and the people lived in darkness. In many areas, people had problems even eating coarse grains and salt. What level of life could there be? It has only been eight years since liberation, and the face of old China has been fundamentally changed, and it is still being continuously changed. These vivid examples are the most convincing stark contrast between the new and old societies.

Zhang Naiqi Attempts to Reverse the Wheels of History

However, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Huang Shaohong, Long Yun, Chu Anping and other bourgeois right-wing elements, turned a blind eye to all this, intentionally obliterating everything. They took advantage of the opportunity to help the Party rectify its work to stir up a counter-current against the Party, against the people, and against socialism, attempting to abolish the leadership of the Party and change our country's system according to their reactionary program, dragging the people of our country back to the road of old China. We express our great indignation at this.

Here, I will focus on the right-wing elements such as Zhang Naiqi who are seeking a market in our industrial and commercial circles, distorting the Party and the government's policy of peaceful transformation, which adopts the principles of overall planning, comprehensive consideration, and reasonable arrangements for private industry and commerce, instigating and enticing industrialists and businessmen to resist socialist transformation, and fundamentally abolishing the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class.

We believe that industrialists and businessmen are receiving fixed interest, and there is still an exploitative relationship with the working class; the dual nature of the bourgeoisie still exists. Zhang Naiqi stubbornly insists that fixed interest is not exploitation, but "unearned income"; the bourgeoisie no longer has a dual nature. We believe that the working class leads the bourgeoisie; there is an essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements, and the boundaries between these two classes cannot be blurred. Zhang Naiqi stubbornly insists that "the difference between leaders and those led in history can only be the difference between the advanced and the backward"; "capitalists hand over their enterprises without any reluctance, which is a selfless quality." We believe that to change from an exploiter to a self-reliant laborer, one must undergo an essential transformation of "remolding one's bones and marrow." Zhang Naiqi stubbornly insists that the bourgeois elements have been transformed almost completely, "If we still have to remold our bones and marrow, it will only increase endless worries for the industrial and commercial circles," "We believe that to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen, we must also help them to seriously carry out transformation." Zhang Naiqi stubbornly insists that emphasizing socialist transformation, "all they will get is negativity, and there will never be any enthusiasm." We believe that we must resolutely take the socialist road, and capitalism is our deadly enemy. Zhang Naiqi stubbornly insists that "bureaucracy is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism." In short, we want to help the industrial and commercial circles to thoroughly transform and take the socialist road, but Zhang Naiqi is stubbornly and stubbornly pushing the wheels of history backward, wanting to take the capitalist road.

Zhang Naiqi's Anti-Communism and Anti-Socialism Have a Long History

We understand that Zhang Naiqi's anti-Party and anti-socialist stance has roots and origins, and is by no means accidental. After the national liberation, he had long proposed that the "exploitation of the Chinese national bourgeoisie is glorious"; the positive and progressive aspects of the thinking of industrial and commercial circles "are already close to the thinking of the working class"; the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie "has been largely eliminated"; everything of the Democratic National Construction Association should "serve the bourgeoisie"; Zhang Naiqi also said at the Democratic National Construction Association's cadre meeting that since the four classes jointly exercise dictatorship, why must we confirm who leads whom. Once again, at a meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, comrades Jian Rilin and Liu Nianyi from Shanghai, in their speeches, examined their own families and how their fathers started by exploiting others. Zhang Naiqi strongly disagreed, believing that these two had not stood firm on the bourgeois position, and did not hesitate to come to their rooms to knock on their doors and advise them to be honest and not to have wild ideas. He often described the acceptance of transformation by industrial and commercial circles as blindly following, and supporting the Communist Party as rowdyism. His reactionary arguments further developed at the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic National Construction Association last year, and have now become even more intensified. What impresses me most is the issue of "red capitalists." We had already opposed his way of beautifying the bourgeoisie and blurring the boundaries between the bourgeoisie and the working class in 1955, believing that it was detrimental to transformation. He once laid down his arms under the comrades' strong rebuttals, but he raised his head again last year, and openly distorted Chairman Mao's speech, boldly fabricating, in front of comrades who were listening to Chairman Mao's speech with him, that Chairman Mao agreed with his concept of red capitalists. It was pure nonsense and slander against the leader. I could not bear it on the spot, and took out my diary to find Chairman Mao's speech notes to clarify that Chairman Mao did not say that. Under irrefutable circumstances, he was speechless, but still insisted on his mistakes and refused to correct them.

I will make a recollection of how Zhang Naiqi's bourgeois thoughts have been reflected in the association since liberation, undermining unity and causing losses to the association's work: The first period, approximately between 1949 and 1952, was his dispute with Comrade Shi Fuliang. After Comrade Shi Fuliang fell ill, it turned to a dispute with Comrade Huang Yanpei. By 1955, it can be said that it had reached a dispute between Zhang Naiqi and the entire association. This struggle, from last year's expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association, the Second Plenary Session, to the most recent dispute between Zhang Naiqi and the Standing Committee of the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, can be regarded as the culmination of the dispute between Zhang Naiqi and the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Extending to today, Zhang Naiqi is not only in dispute with the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, but Zhang Naiqi's bourgeois poisonous fire has spread to the dispute with the working class, the dispute with the Communist Party, and the dispute with the people of the whole country. This is not only an issue of ideological understanding, but also a political issue, a major issue of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. We must give it a severe counterattack, pursue it fiercely, until he bows his head, admits his guilt, and thoroughly corrects his mistakes. We will never stop until we achieve victory.

Over the years, in order to unite and win over Zhang Naiqi, we have given personal advice several times, group suggestions, round-table dinners, head-to-head meetings between the chairman and vice-chairman, from room groups to standing committee groups, to the Second Plenary Session, and the recent joint expanded meeting of the standing committees of the two associations. For the sake of work, for the transformation of private industry, and also to save him, we have adhered to Chairman Mao's teachings, using gentle breezes and fine rains, and patient persuasion. However, the gentler our breeze, the louder his counterattack; the finer our rain, the higher he raised his head. Many times, many people talked to him about unity and association affairs, but he always held his pipe, stared at the ceiling in a daze, and put on an air of being full of knowledge and unapproachable. First, he would scold the people he hated, and no matter what was said, he always insisted on his own way. This was the case in the past, and it is still the case now. Many of our comrades during this period only saw his extreme subjectivism and crazy arrogance, and did not deeply dissect Zhang Naiqi's position, viewpoint, ideological roots, and the essence of Zhang Naiqi as a person. They always tried to unite and win him over, but the results were completely in vain.

Zhang Naiqi has ulterior motives. He echoes and cooperates with right-wing elements such as Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji. Through this anti-rightist struggle, the broad masses of industrial and commercial circles have exposed this mystery. Why must Zhang Naiqi put on the cloak of socialism, hate the working class, and oppose the Party and socialism? This is because we have not thoroughly understood Zhang Naiqi's ideological system and grasped Zhang Naiqi's pulse in the past. He is a complete bourgeois element, and has a firm ideological root, that is, Zhang Naiqi can only allow a capitalist crown to be worn on his head, and everything else will not fit. It is precisely because his extreme bourgeois individualism has remained intact since liberation that he will always carry out activities and release his political toxins to realize his ambitions whenever there is an opportunity.

Zhang Naiqi Puts His Political Bet on a Market That Is Increasingly Declining, and Is Bound to Fail Miserably

Zhang Naiqi's series of reactionary words and deeds have already had an extremely bad influence in the industrial and commercial circles. His purpose of inciting the industrial and commercial circles to oppose the Party and socialism has been more clearly exposed recently. He specializes in the phrase "remolding one's bones and marrow," using all his thoughts, and maliciously distorts it, using phrases such as shedding the mortal body, changing to immortal bones, and drawing sinews and peeling skin to arouse the dissatisfaction of the industrial and commercial circles. As expected, many people have been deceived. Comrade Zhao Yuming from Chengdu believes that the Communist Party regards the bourgeoisie as useless things and wants to use whips to draw sinews and transform them. Kang Xinru from Chongqing said that the Communist Party wants the industrial and commercial circles to learn Taoism and give birth to babies on their heads, which can only be done by women who have been wives for two lifetimes. A branch head of the Democratic National Construction Association in Hangzhou publicly promoted at a branch meeting that "Zhang Naiqi is the true representative of our class," openly opposed the essential transformation of "remolding one's bones and marrow," and called on branch members to speak out about the "anger that has been endured for several years," and he is willing to fully support them. What is especially absurd is that a Huang Miaofu in Shanghai has recently unilaterally exaggerated the shortcomings in the work of the Party and the government, compiled them into booklets, and distributed them everywhere, undermining the prestige of the Party and the government. Zhang Naiqi wrote a letter to Huang, telling him that he would definitely do his best to support him. It seems that right-wing elements such as Zhang Naiqi have a certain market. The social foundation of their market is the negative side of the dual nature of the bourgeoisie. However, Zhang Naiqi has miscalculated. The economic foundation of capitalism has been dug up, and socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory. Your market is already a dying thing. Especially after this anti-rightist struggle, it will only increasingly expose its backwardness and reactionary nature. This is not your market, but the tomb that buries you. While you are admiring Li Kangnian's "Fixed Interest for Twenty Years" and Wu Jincui's "What to Learn from the Working Class," Li Kangnian has already withdrawn his suggestion, and Wu Jincui has already begun to examine himself. At the same time, you have aroused the anger of worker and farmer representatives in the Sichuan delegation group. They said that the Communist Party has liberated the whole of China, and the workers and peasants have gained a happy life. Zhang Naiqi wants to use those fallacies to undermine the unity of the Chinese people. We will fight you to the end. Zhang Naiqi wants to seize our happiness and return to the old road. We firmly express our determination to wage a resolute struggle against you, the anti-Party right-wing element. These solemn voices represent the strength of hundreds of millions of workers and peasants throughout China who support the Communist Party and defend socialism. This is something that no one dares to ignore. We warn right-wing elements such as Zhang Naiqi that if you put your political bet on this increasingly declining market, you will definitely have no future and will inevitably fail miserably. The people of the whole of China are clenching their fists and waiting for you. We believe that victory will definitely belong to us.

We Will Not Stop the Struggle Against the Rightists Until They Surrender

Friends in the industrial and commercial circles, accepting transformation is like climbing a mountain. You must move forward step by step, steadily and firmly, without shaking or swaying, and persist to the end. You must take another step forward even when you are at the top of a hundred-foot pole. After handing over the means of production, you must further hand over the bourgeois ideology before you can truly embark on a smooth road. Zhang Naiqi, the hero of the right-wing elements, does not want to see us reaching the top of the mountain and the light is already in sight. He is holding a black flag and shouting loudly: Li Kangnian, you are good. Fixed interest is not exploitation, and it is not wrong to take it for another twenty years. Wu Jincui is right. You don't have to learn from the working class. The bourgeoisie and the working class are the same, and both need to be transformed. He uses these statements to stop everyone from moving forward. How dangerous and malicious this is! Can Zhang Naiqi's statement and practice not be anti-Party and anti-socialist? Can Zhang Naiqi's behavior guarantee that there will be no anti-Party and anti-socialist elements even if his bones are burned to ashes? Is he worthy of saying that he loves the Party as he loves his eyes? (Refuting Zhang Naiqi's words) Please pay attention, stand firm, distinguish right from wrong, do not listen to the lies of the right-wing elements, and be careful not to fall from the mountainside. We must sharpen our eyes, see through the conspiracies and tricks of the rightists. We will not stop until the rightists surrender. The door to socialist transformation is open. If they persist in their reactionary stance and resist transformation, they will cut themselves off from the people. Friends in the industrial and commercial circles, do not be fooled by the right-wing elements. Draw a clear line as soon as possible, persist in transformation under the leadership of the Party, resolutely fight the right-wing elements to the end, and move forward bravely towards the socialist road without looking back.

Two Hopes

Finally, I will talk about two points. In recent years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our country's people's democratic united front has achieved great achievements in uniting the broad masses of people of all classes and strata in the country, mobilizing all positive factors, and serving socialism. It has also had a positive impact internationally and has received high praise. The Party has put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," which has far-reaching positive significance for consolidating and expanding the people's democratic united front. I believe that while putting forward this policy, we must strengthen the Party's leadership over all aspects of the united front, especially the leadership over the democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. The political freedom and organizational independence of the democratic parties do not mean that the Party's leadership does not need to be strengthened. In order for the democratic parties to be able to assume their responsibilities in the future and achieve long-term coexistence and mutual supervision with the Party, we earnestly hope that the Party will strengthen its leadership over our democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Our democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce must also unswervingly accept the leadership of the Party and work hard and contribute all our strength in the cause of building socialism.

Secondly, because the dual nature of the industrial and commercial circles still exists, and because the issue of who will win between socialism and capitalism in the ideological field has not been resolved, it is very necessary to vigorously strengthen the ideological transformation of the industrial and commercial circles. Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech to all members of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce two years ago that the propaganda departments of the Party committees should be responsible for the ideological education of the industrial and commercial circles. In the past year or so, the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Party has not managed this aspect of the work much, and some regions have not even managed it. The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association asked them for propaganda and education materials, but they did not provide enough support. We hope to change this situation. Of course, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association also had many shortcomings in carrying out ideological transformation in the industrial and commercial circles in the past. Everyone who works in the two associations, including myself, has a responsibility. We must strive to overcome these shortcomings and faults. We especially hope that friends in the industrial and commercial circles will recognize the great significance of ideological transformation, and its long-term and arduous nature, and unceasingly "destroy capitalism and establish socialism," so that socialism can achieve a decisive victory in our ideological field, and make ourselves truly glorious laborers of a socialist society. Comrades, let's work hard!

    决不放松对章乃器的批判
    胡子昂的发言
    我完全同意周总理所作的政府工作报告和大会的其他各项报告。
    周总理在报告中，用许多具体的数字、生动的事例，说明了我们的国家在解放几年来，已经在各个战线上取得了伟大的成就。全国农业、手工业和资本主义工商业基本上完成了社会主义改造，这是把几千年来的生产资料私有制变为公有制的社会主义革命。谁能说，这不是由于中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导，能够取得这样巨大的成就吗？我国的工业总产值在五年计划的前三年共增加了一百七十七亿元，去年一年就增加了一百三十九亿元，提前一年完成并超额完成了五年计划最后一年的指标，我国工业化初步基础已经建立起来。这不是党和政府正确地规划了建设和改造相结合的步骤，使我国的社会主义建设能够有这样一个飞跃的发展吗？去年，我们的国家遭到近几十年来最大的一次灾荒，受灾田地二亿三千万亩，受灾人口七千万，但是全国农业总产值仍比一九五五年增加了二十七亿四千万元；粮食总产量还超额完成了五年计划。这不是由于党和政府的积极领导与支持，社会主义制度的优越，能够经得住这样严重的灾情的考验吗？占我国人口百分之八十以上的农民，解放以来的生活逐年上升，去年一年全国农民的购买力上升到一百九十一亿元，比一九五○年增长了百分之一百三十六。在七年中，国家解决了一千三百万人的就业问题，全国职工工资在近四年中间提高了将近百分之三十七，这些都是中国历史上从所未有的。这不是在党和政府的领导下，选择了社会主义的道路，全国人民能够有今天这样的生活吗？
    我们过去只要曾经生活在国民党反动统治时期的人们，都永远不会忘记当时的景况，尤其是蒋介石把重庆当作最后魔窟的时候，盗匪横行，白昼抢人，朝天门纵火打劫，特务赶人下水，四大家族一面由香港派飞机装运金元券、银元券大肆抢购黄金美钞，一面挨门挨户搜括金银手饰，那种人吃人的世界，是多么可怕的时代！反动政权从来不谈建设，蒋介石统治几十年，人民生活在黑暗之中，许多地区的人民吃杂粮、吃盐都成问题，还有什么生活水平可说。解放才八年，已经根本改变了旧中国的面貌，还正在继续不断地改变中，这些活生生的事例，就是最有说服力量的新、旧社会的鲜明的对比。
    章乃器妄图倒转历史车轮
    但是，章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、黄绍竑、龙云、储安平等资产阶级右派分子，却睁开眼睛说瞎话，有意抹杀这一切，利用帮助党整风的机会掀起一股反党、反人民、反社会主义的逆流，妄想取消党的领导，按照他们的反动纲领来改变我们国家的制度，把我国人民拖回旧中国的道路。我们对此表示极大的愤恨。
    这里专谈在我们工商界找市场的章乃器等右派分子，歪曲党和政府用和平改造的政策对私营工商业采取统筹兼顾、合理安排和进行改造的方针，挑拨引诱工商业者抵抗社会主义改造，从根本上取消共产党和工人阶级的领导。
    我们认定，工商业者在拿定息，对工人阶级还存在剥削关系；资产阶级的两面性依然存在。章乃器硬说定息不是剥削，是“不劳而获”；资产阶级已经没有两面性了。我们认定工人阶级领导资产阶级；资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子有本质的差别，不能把这两个阶级的界限混淆起来。章乃器硬说“历史上领导者与被领导者的区别，都只能是先进与落后的区别”；“资本家毫无留恋地交出企业，就是大公无私的品质”。我们认定从一个剥削者改变为自食其力的劳动者，必须经过“脱胎换骨”的本质的改造。章乃器硬说，资产阶级分子已经改造的差不多了，“如果还要脱胎换骨，只能使工商界增加无穷的忧虑”，“我们认定要充分发挥工商业家的积极性，必须同时帮助他们认真进行改造。章乃器硬说，强调社会主义改造，“他们所得到的只能是消极性，而绝不会是积极性”。我们认定，要坚决走社会主义道路，资本主义是我们的死敌。章乃器硬说，“官僚主义是比资本主义更加危险的敌人”。总之，我们要帮助工商界彻底改造，走社会主义的路，章乃器却死心蹋地顽强地把历史车轮推向后转，要走资本主义的路。
    章乃器反共、反社会主义由来已久
    我们了解：章乃器的反党、反社会主义，是有本有源，决非偶然。全国解放以后，他早就提出中国民族资产阶级的“剥削是光荣的”；工商界积极、进步一面的思想，“已经接近工人阶级的思想”；民族资产阶级的两面性“已经大体上消除了”；民建会的一切都应该“为资产阶级服务”；章乃器还在民建干部会议上讲，既然四大阶级联合专政，何必一定确认谁领导谁。又有一次在全联的会上，上海简日林、刘念义两位同志，在发言中检查了自家的家庭，自己的父亲，如何剥削起家。章乃器大不为然，认为这两位没有站稳资产阶级立场，不惜来到住室叩门相告，劝他们老实点，不要想入非非。他常把工商界接受改造，说成是盲从，拥护共产党，说成是起哄。他的这些反动的论调，到了去年民建会二中全会时，进一步有了发展，到现在更是变本加厉。令我印象最深的，是“红色资产阶级”这个问题。我们在一九五五年就已经反对过他的这种美化资产阶级，模糊资产阶级与工人阶级界限的说法，认为对改造是不利的。他曾经在同志们的严词驳斥下，一度放下武器，但到去年又抬了头，并公开歪曲毛主席的讲话，胆大包天，当着同他一道听毛主席讲话的同志面前，捏造毛主席同意他的红色资产阶级的说法，真是一派胡言，诬蔑领袖，当场我实在忍耐不住了，拿出日记本找出毛主席讲话的笔记，辨明毛主席并不是那样说的。他在无可抵赖之下，无可置辩，但依然坚持错误不肯改正。
    我把解放以来这些年代里，章乃器的资产阶级思想反映在会内破坏团结、使会务受到损失试作一个回忆：第一个时期，大约在一九四九年到一九五二年之间，是他与施复亮同志之争。施复亮同志病后，又转到与黄炎培同志之争。到一九五五年，可以说已经到了章乃器与全会之争，这一斗争从去年民建常委扩大会议、二中全会以来，以至最近一次章乃器与民建会、工商联全体常委之争，算是章乃器与中国民主建国会与全国工商业联合会之争到了顶点。延至今天，章乃器不仅是与民建会、工商联之争，章乃器的资产阶级的毒火已经蔓延到与工人阶级之争、与共产党之争、与全国人民之争。这已经不仅是思想认识问题，而且是政治问题，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间的斗争的重大问题。我们必须予以严厉反击、猛追，一直追到他低头认罪、彻底改正错误为止，如不胜利决不收兵。
    这些年来我们为了团结争取章乃器，曾经若干次地个人劝告，小组进言，圆桌聚餐，主副委碰头，由房间小组到常会大组、到二中全会，及最近的两会常委联席扩大会，我们为了工作，为了对私改造，也为了挽救他，我们谨守着毛主席的教训，和风细雨，耐心说服。但是，我们的风越和，他反扑的声音越大，我们的雨越细，他的头抬得越高。很多时候很多人同他谈到团结，谈到会务，他总是衔着烟斗，向天花板出神，摆出一付满复经纶，高不可攀的面孔。首先把他所讨厌的人痛骂一顿，任凭怎样说，他始终坚持他的一套。过去如此，现在仍然如此。我们很多同志在这段时期，只看到他的极端的主观主义，疯狂的骄傲自大，并没有从章乃器的立场观点、思想根源，从章乃器这个人的本质加以深刻的解剖，总是团结争取，结果完全落空。
    章乃器是另有用心的。他同章伯钧、罗隆基等右派分子是彼此呼应，配合作战的。经过这次反右派斗争，广大工商界揭穿了这个谜。章乃器为什么一定要穿起社会主义的外衣，仇视工人阶级，反党、反社会主义呢？这就怪我们过去没有更深透了解章乃器的思想体系，摸清章乃器的脉搏。他是一个十足的资产阶级分子，早有一个不可动摇的思想根源，那就是章乃器头上只能容许戴一顶资本主义的王冠，除此以外，一切都将是不合尺寸的。正是由于他的这种极端的资产阶级个人主义立场解放以来原封不动，所以，只要一有机会，他总要大肆活动，放射他的政治毒素，实现他的野心。
    章乃器把政治赌注押在日趋没落的市场上，必然一败涂地
    章乃器的一系列反动言行，已经在工商界中产生了极恶劣的影响。他的煽动工商界反党、反社会主义的目的，最近暴露得更较明显。他专以脱胎换骨这一句话用尽心思，不惜恶毒曲解，用脱凡胎、换仙骨、抽筋剥皮等语句挑起工商界的不满。果然很多受到诱骗，成都赵瑀明同志，认为共产党是把资产阶级当成不成器的东西，要用鞭子来抽筋改造。重庆康心如说共产党要工商界学道，头顶上出婴儿，这只有二辈子做妇人。杭州民建会的一个支部负责人，在支部会上大肆宣传“章乃器是我们这个阶级的真正代表人物”，公开反对“脱胎换骨”的本质改造，并号召支部成员把“忍了好几年的气”，都讲出来，他愿全力支持。尤其荒谬的上海有个黄苗夫，最近他把党和政府工作中的缺点，片面地加以夸大，编印成小册子，到处分发，破坏党和政府的威信。章乃器写信告诉黄，我一定尽棉薄之力为你撑腰。看来章乃器等右派分子是有一定的市场。他们的市场的社会基础就是资产阶级两面性中的消极一面。但是，章乃器估计错了，资本主义的经济基础已经挖掉，社会主义改造已经取得决定性的胜利，你的市场已经是奄奄一息的垂死的东西，特别是经过这次反右派的斗争，只会日益暴露它的落后性、反动性。这不是你的市场，而是葬送你的坟墓。当你正在欣赏李康年“定息二十年”、吴金萃“向工人阶级学习什么”两篇“谬论”的时候，李康年已经撤回建议了，吴金萃已经开始检讨了。同时你在四川代表小组激起了工人、农民代表的愤怒，他们说共产党解放全中国，工人农民得到了幸福生活，章乃器要用那些谬论来破坏中国人民的团结，我们是要与你斗争到底。章乃器要夺取我们的幸福回到过去的老路，我们坚决表示要同你这个反党的右派分子作坚决的斗争。——这些严正的声音，代表了全中国千千万万个工农人民拥护共产党、捍卫社会主义的力量，这是任何人不敢忽视的。我们正告章乃器等右派分子，如果把政治赌注押在这个日趋没落的市场上，肯定没有前途，必然会一败涂地，我们全中国的人民，都握着拳头在等你，相信胜利一定是属于我们的。
    右派分子一天不投降、我们反对右派的斗争一天不罢休
    工商界的朋友们，接受改造犹如登山，必须步步前进、稳扎稳走，不摇不摆，坚持到底。百尺杆头还要再进一步，交出了生产资料，还要进一步交出资产阶级的思想，最后才可能走上坦途。章乃器这位右派分子的英雄，他不愿看到我们登山将要到顶，光明已经在望，手执黑旗在那里大声叫喊：李康年你是好的，定息不是剥削，再拿二十年也没有错；吴金萃是对的，可以不向工人阶级学习，资产阶级与工人阶级一样，都要改造。他用这些说法阻止大家前进，这是多么危险，这是多么恶毒。难道章乃器这种说法和做法，还不是反党、反社会主义吗？难道章乃器的这些行为，还能够保证他骨头烧成灰都没有反党反社会主义的成分吗？还配说爱护党向爱护眼睛一样吗？（驳章乃器语）请大家注意，要站稳立场、明辨是非、不要听信右派分子的谎言，谨防从半山上跌下来了。我们必须擦亮眼睛，识破右派的阴谋诡计，右派分子一天不投降，我们一天不罢休，社会主义改造大门是敞开的，如果他坚持反动立场，抗拒改造，那将自绝于人民。工商界朋友们，不要上右派分子的当。趁早划清界限在党的领导下，坚持改造，坚决同右派分子斗争到底，毫不回头地向着社会主义道路勇往迈进。
    两点希望
    最后，我谈两点。这些年来，在中国共产党领导下，我国人民民主统一战线在团结国内各阶级、各阶层的广大人民，调动一切积极因素，为社会主义服务，已经取得了巨大成就，并在国际上产生了积极的影响，获得了很高的评价，党提出“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，对于巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，有着深远的积极的意义。我认为，在提出这一方针的同时，必须加强党对统一战线内各个方面的领导，特别是加强对各民主党派、工商联的领导。民主党派的政治自由，组织独立，并不意味着不需要加强党的领导。为了使各民主党派今后能够担当起它的责任，实现同党长期共存、互相监督，我们殷切地期望党加强对我们民主党派、工商联的领导。我们民主党派、工商联也必须坚定不移地接受党的领导，在建设社会主义事业中，努力工作，贡献一切力量。
    其次，由于工商界的两面性还存在，由于思想领域中社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题还没有解决，大力加强工商界的思想改造，就是十分必要的。毛主席在前年对工商联全体执行委员的讲话中就已指出，党委宣传部门要管工商界的思想教育工作。一年多来，党中央宣传部对这方面的工作管得不多，有的地区甚至还没有管。工商联、民建会向他们要宣传教育材料没有，支持不够，我们希望改变这个情况。当然，工商联、民建会过去在对工商界进行思想改造工作中，也有不少缺点，担任两会工作的每一个人，包括我自己在内，都有责任，我们一定要努力来克服这些缺点和毛病。我们特别是期望工商界的朋友们，认清思想改造的重大意义，和它的长期性和艰巨性，一刻不停地“破资本主义、立社会主义”，让社会主义在我们的思想领域内取得决定性的胜利，使自己真正成为一个社会主义社会的光荣劳动者。同志们，努力吧！
