Xinhua News Agency, Hefei: In Anhui Province, the complacency and smugness among some cadres and farmers following the summer harvest is being reversed. Agricultural cooperatives are being urged to actively complete their summer planting plans and strengthen field management of autumn crops in an effort to achieve another great autumn harvest.

The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently instructed all localities to swiftly reverse the blindly optimistic, wait-for-harvest mentality, and immediately take action and adopt various measures to strive for an autumn harvest. The Bengbu Local Committee of the Communist Party of China convened meetings of county party secretaries in Chuxian, Suxian, and Bengbu at the end of June and the beginning of July. They studied and proposed seven key steps to strive for an autumn harvest: First, seize the time to comprehensively complete summer planting tasks as quickly as possible; second, do a good job in field management of mid- and early-autumn crops; third, starting in July, launch a mass manure accumulation campaign throughout the entire special district to prepare sufficient fertilizer for topdressing autumn crops and applying base fertilizer for autumn planting; fourth, take advantage of the lush grass growth in July and August to maintain existing livestock and actively develop grass sources and stockpile fodder in the Huai River area and economic crop areas, and vigorously breed young animals to overcome the shortage of animal power; fifth, in the spirit of adapting to local conditions, develop diversified sideline production to increase members' income, and immediately begin stockpiling raw materials for winter sideline production; sixth, conduct education on running cooperatives and households diligently and thriftily, saving food and preparing for disasters, and overcome extravagance and waste; seventh, strengthen leadership over agricultural production, with the first secretary of the county party committee personally taking charge of production, and county and district-level organizations should transfer as many cadres as possible to agricultural cooperatives to help with work, especially strengthening leadership in backward areas. The Anqing, Wuhu, Lu'an, and Fuyang Local Committees of the Communist Party of China have also studied specific methods for striving for an autumn harvest based on their specific local conditions.

Under the call and with the help of leading organizations, agricultural cooperatives in various places have promptly conducted ideological education among their members and quickly launched the work of striving for an autumn harvest. The blindly optimistic sentiment and slackening of efforts among farmers in Xuan County have been largely reversed. In Zhouwang District, the number of farmers participating in weeding and topdressing has increased from 11,000 to more than 22,000. In five days, they weeded over 44,000 mu of intermediate rice once and topdressed each mu with 10 dan of fertilizer. Farmers in Hanting District rushed to cultivate over 6,000 mu of wheat stubble land in the three days after the rain and planted 1,700 mu of miscellaneous grains. All 342 ponds and dams in the county that had been washed away by floods were repaired and filled with water. In the production inspection in Hanshan County, it was discovered that 50,000 mu of dry land in the county were vacant and uncultivated. The county immediately launched a campaign to eliminate idle land, demanding that not a single mu be left uncultivated. Initial achievements have been made in pest control and manure accumulation in various agricultural cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th: Grassroots cadres and farmers in Hunan Province have a blindly optimistic attitude of waiting for a bumper harvest. Some areas have taken measures and are actively taking action after inspecting their work.

Hunan Province is beginning to harvest early rice, and the mid-season rice is also growing well. This has caused a slackening of efforts in the minds of some rural cadres and farmers, who believe that this year the weather is favorable, and they will reap a bumper harvest even with their eyes closed. Therefore, they have neglected the management of late rice seedling beds and preparations for fertilizer needed for late rice. Currently, many agricultural cooperatives have not assigned specific personnel to cultivate late rice seedlings. A survey of 31 agricultural cooperatives in Hanshou County found that 10 of them had no one managing the late rice seedling beds, and the loss of seeds trampled by chickens and ducks exceeded 1,000 jin. Surveys in Xiangxiang, Linli, and other counties found that 10% to 30% of the late rice seedlings were sown too early. Some agricultural cooperatives have unreasonable compensation regulations for managing late rice seedlings, so the seedling protectors are not very active, and the seedling beds are not well managed.

Another problem in striving for a bumper harvest of late rice is the insufficient preparation of fertilizer, but the summer manure accumulation campaign in many areas has been slow to start. The main reasons for the slow start of the summer manure accumulation campaign are that some cooperative cadres have resistance in their thinking, emphasizing that they are too busy at the moment and that there are no sources of fertilizer. There are also a small number of production teams that are afraid of exceeding their contracted work points and are unwilling to contribute more labor to accumulate fertilizer. Now, some areas have begun to take remedial measures through inspection work.

    再接再厉争取秋季大丰收
    安徽湖南农民坐等丰收思想要扭转
    据新华社合肥电  安徽省农村中正在扭转部分干部和农民在夏季丰收后产生的麻痹自满思想，推动各农业社积极完成夏种计划，努力加强秋季作物的田间管理，再接再厉地争取秋季大丰收。
    中共安徽省委员会最近指示各地必须迅速扭转盲目乐观、坐等丰收的思想，立即行动起来，采取各种措施争取秋季丰收。中共蚌埠地方委员会在6月底7月初分别在滁县、宿县、蚌埠等地召开县委书记会议，研究并提出了争取秋季丰收的七个环节：一、要抢时间尽快地全面完成夏种任务；二、做好中、早秋作物的田间管理工作；三、从7月份起，在全专区范围内开展群众性的积肥运动，为秋庄稼的追肥和秋种施基肥准备充足的肥料；四、趁7、8月份是青草旺盛的季节，把现有的牲口保养好，在沿淮地区和经济作物地区要积极开辟草源，储备饲草，并大力繁殖幼畜，克服畜力不足的困难；五、根据因地制宜的精神，开展多种多样的副业生产，增加社员收入，并立即着手储备冬季副业生产的原料；六、开展勤俭办社、勤俭持家、省吃俭用、防备灾荒的教育，克服铺张浪费的现象；七、加强对农业生产的领导，县委第一书记要亲自抓生产，县、区两级机关应尽可能抽调一些干部到农业社去帮助工作，特别要加强对后进地区的领导。中共安庆、芜湖、六安、阜阳等地方委员会也都根据当地具体情况，研究了争取秋季丰收的具体办法。
    各地农业社在领导机关的号召和帮助下，及时向社员进行思想教育，很快地展开了争取秋季丰收的工作。宣城县农民中对生产的盲目乐观情绪和松劲思想，已经基本上扭转过来。周王区参加除草、追肥的农民由一万一千多人增加到两万二千多人，五天中把四万四千多亩中稻除了一次草，每亩追施了十担肥料。寒亭区农民在雨后三天中抢耕麦茬地六千多亩，已种上一千七百亩杂粮。全县被洪水冲毁的三百四十二口塘坝，也整修好了，并且蓄满了水。含山县在检查生产中发现，全县有五万亩旱地空着，没有种庄稼。这个县立即开展了一个消灭闲地运动，要求不荒一亩地。各地农业社在治虫和积肥工作方面已初步获得成绩。
    据新华社长沙16日电  湖南省农村基层干部和农民有坐等丰产的盲目乐观情绪。部分地区通过检查工作已采取措施积极行动起来。
    湖南省各地正开始收割早稻，全省中稻也生长良好，在一些农村干部和农民思想上产生了松劲情绪，认为今年风调雨顺，闭着眼睛也要捞一个丰收年，因此忽视了晚稻秧田管理和晚稻需肥等准备工作。目前许多农业社没有确定专人培育晚稻秧苗，汉寿县检查了三十一个农业社，发现有十个社的晚稻秧田无人管理，被鸡鸭践踏损失种谷一千多斤。湘乡、临澧等县检查，都有10％到30％的晚稻秧苗播种过早。有些农业社对管理晚稻秧苗的报酬规定不合理，因此护秧人很不积极，秧田管理得不好。
    争取晚稻丰收的另一个问题是肥料准备不足，但许多地区夏季积肥运动迟迟开展不起来。夏季积肥运动开展不起来的原因，主要是部分社干部思想上有抵触情绪，强调当前忙不过来和没有肥源。也有少数生产队怕超过包工工分，不愿多出工积肥。现在，有些地区通过检查工作，已开始采取措施进行补救。
