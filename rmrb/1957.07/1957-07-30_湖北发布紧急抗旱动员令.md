    Hubei Issues Emergency Drought Relief Mobilization Order

    (Our newspaper, Hankou, July 29th) On the afternoon of the 25th, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee held an emergency meeting on drought relief to discuss and decide on vigorous drought relief to ensure an all-round bumper harvest. Hubei Province has had no rain for the past half-month. Except for some mountainous areas in the Enshi and Xiangyang regions, the entire province is generally threatened by drought. According to the Meteorological Observatory forecast, there will still be no heavy rain in most parts of the province in the next ten days or so. In order to strive to prevent grain and cotton production from suffering disaster losses, the meeting requested leaders at all levels to first draw personnel from various departments directly under the provincial government to go to the front line, and organize 300 to 500 people to go to the countryside to help the masses fight drought. Urban factories and enterprises should also organize diesel engines, water pumps, and technical workers to go to the countryside to help the masses fight drought. On the 26th, the Provincial People's Committee issued a mobilization order of "Go All Out to Overcome the Drought Disaster" and is drawing cadres to go to the countryside. Agricultural cooperatives in drought-stricken areas are now vigorously using waterwheels to irrigate their fields.

    湖北发布紧急抗旱动员令
    本报汉口29日电　25日下午，湖北省人民委员会召开抗旱紧急会议，讨论决定大力抗旱，保证全面丰收。湖北省最近半月无雨，全省除恩施、襄阳专区部分山区外，其他地区普遍受到旱象威胁。据气象台预报：在未来十天左右全省大部分地区仍然没有大雨。为了争取粮食棉花产量不受灾害损失，会议要求各级领导，首先从省直属机关各部门抽调人员上前线，并组织三百到五百人下乡帮助群众抗旱，城市工厂、企业也要组织柴油机、抽水机和技术工人下乡，帮助群众抗旱。26日，省人民委员会发布了“全力以赴，战胜旱灾”的动员令，并在抽调干部下乡。现在各地受旱农业社正在大力车水灌田。
