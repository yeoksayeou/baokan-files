My Self-Criticism
Zhang Naiqi's Speech

I am a person who has made mistakes. The nature of my mistakes is the bourgeois individualist ideology and style. Indeed, before liberation, individual heroism played some beneficial roles for me. At that time, I was in a contradiction between the socialist ideal and the capitalist reality. Relying on the Party's leadership and my own individual heroism, which did not go along with the environment at the time, I was able to escape the quagmire and embark on the revolution. In 1952, I criticized my individualism. I realized that even if it had been useful to me in the old era, it would be absolutely unacceptable in the future. I realized that socialism—collectivism—is exactly opposed to individualism. In the subsequent three years or so, my individualism was somewhat overcome. However, since the 20th Congress of the CPSU in the spring of 1956, my individualism has grown again. Moreover, because I prided myself on not seeking fame or fortune and had no personal egoism, it fueled individual heroism and individual liberalism. Specifically, in my working relationships with many parties and even in my family relationships, disharmonious situations arose. And the mistakes that occurred this time in terms of speech are inseparable from my individualism and one-sided optimistic views. That is to say, I overestimated the socialist transformation of national bourgeois elements too optimistically; at the same time, because the article developed from a series of anti-dogmatism debates, it brought a lot of individualistic impulses, which also brought one-sidedness; also, publishing without carefully estimating the impact was a manifestation of a liberalist style.

After studying Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's government work report, and with the enthusiastic help of many comrades, my ideological understanding has been improved; now, let me first examine, correct, and clarify the following points:

I. Fixed interest is not exploitation, but unearned income – I originally said: from the perspective of individual private personnel, fixed interest is unearned income, not exploitation; from the perspective of the entire national bourgeoisie, it is the residue of exploitation. This was derived from the fact that someone in the past had affirmed that the contradiction between the working class and the national bourgeoisie was already a non-antagonistic contradiction. Now, Chairman Mao's speech analyzes that the contradictions among the people... when speaking of the exploited class and the exploiting class, besides the antagonistic side, there is also a non-antagonistic side. This analysis is very correct. Therefore, what he said later: that capitalists still take fixed interest, which means there is still exploitation, is also very correct. I should negate my original erroneous statement.

II. There is no essential difference between bourgeois elements and working-class elements – My original text interpreted "essence" as "instinctive, innate," "born with it, and lasting until death." This interpretation is one-sidedly exaggerated and divorced from reality. Therefore, the conclusion that there is no essential difference based on this erroneous interpretation is, of course, wrong. The general explanation for "essential difference" should be that there is an essential difference between exploitation and non-exploitation, and anti-exploitation. This essential difference certainly exists.

III. Bureaucratism is a more dangerous enemy than capitalism – I did not say that socialism inevitably brings bureaucratism. On the contrary, I believe that "as long as the 'three evils' are eliminated, it will become a standard socialist enterprise, institution." However, some rightists have already equated socialism with bureaucratism and even the "three evils," and my statement is easily confused with their statements. I should negate my statement.

IV. The national bourgeoisie no longer has a dual character – I did not say that. I said it has a dual character, but the content has changed. My statement may still be wrong and should be continued to be examined and corrected.

V. Industrialists and businessmen can love socialism without transformation – This is not what I said. In my article "On the Dual Character of the Chinese National Bourgeoisie," in paragraphs (2) and (3) alone, I mentioned the victory of the Party and government's transformation policy three times, and also emphasized that "existence determines consciousness," and that we should see the "great existence"—the strength of the people, the strength of the socialist economy, the unprecedented unity and prosperity of the motherland, and the growing unity and prosperity of the socialist camp.

There are other erroneous arguments that need to be corrected, and I will continue to examine them. Theoretical errors, once clarified, can be negated without hesitation.

I frankly admit that I strongly advocate shortening the distance between people within the people to facilitate unity and work. Coupled with my overly optimistic estimate of the socialist transformation of national bourgeois elements, unilaterally emphasizing the aspect of enhancing their enthusiasm, it is very likely to bring about the side effect of blurring class boundaries. But I would never be foolish enough to think that the bourgeoisie is smarter than the working class, or that capitalists are better than workers. I have always advocated that industrialists and businessmen need to undergo long-term human self-transformation. My overall evaluation of the Chinese national bourgeoisie is summarized in four sentences: congenitally deficient, acquired maladjustment, useful for a long time, and a fitting end. It means that it can play some beneficial role in our era and can eventually eliminate itself under the leadership of the working class; this is good. I don't think this is beautifying the bourgeoisie. I have always believed that it is a class that is more backward than the working class. A person who has committed serious bourgeois individualism certainly belongs to the right wing on the ideological front. But after thorough self-examination, I have nothing in common with those rightists who are politically anti-Party and anti-socialist.

Many people who have been close to me can prove that I am often a revolutionary optimist. I have said to many people that before liberation, there were three threats that constantly haunted me: one was political threat—the reactionaries could kill me at any time; another was social threat—the reactionaries could instigate hooligans to persecute me; and there was also an economic threat—enterprises could go bankrupt at any time, leading to unemployment. After liberation, these three threats have completely disappeared. I now have only one goal—to do the work assigned to me by the Party and the country well; learning is also for the sake of work. I often work and study for more than ten hours a day, all for the sake of socialism.

In the past eight years, my words and actions have indeed had nothing in common with those anti-Party and anti-socialist rightists. First, I have never exaggerated the shortcomings of the country's work or obliterated the achievements of the country's work. On the contrary, I often take pride in every little achievement of the country's work; because there is my extremely meager contribution in it. Second, I firmly believe in the strength of the Party and the country and never believe that the Hungarian incident will happen in our country, and I have never inquired about news of students possibly causing trouble. If I were to examine the one-sidedness of my thinking, it would only be one-sided optimism, and certainly not pessimism. Third, I have always participated in various tasks, meetings, and even inspections in various places with the consciousness of a master, helping the leadership to solve problems, and never creating troubles or stirring up fires everywhere. Fourth, I have always expressed the most friendly and sincere attitude towards the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, without the slightest violation of the spirit of "leaning to one side." Fifth, I have never engaged in any small organizations, nor have I ever strived for private rights; I often feel that the honor and treatment given to me by the country and the people are already too high, and I have never been the slightest bit dissatisfied. Therefore, I believe that I must work day and night and do my job well in order to be worthy of the Party and the country. Sixth, in this rectification movement, the opinions I have put forward to the Party have not exceeded the scope of criticizing the "three evils," and what I have pointed out are only the shortcomings of certain and partial Party members, and certainly do not involve the entire Party and the Party Central Committee. I believe that the current rumors about me will gradually be clarified.

In the past eight years, I have had no doubts about the principles and policies put forward by the Party. Not only have I had no doubts, but I have often felt that they were unexpectedly good. However, on certain specific issues or in the implementation of certain specific tasks, I have put forward many different opinions and have done my best to "know everything and say everything." The relationship of cooperation and collaboration with Party members is also harmonious in the vast majority of cases; but I have criticized the attitude and style of a small number of Party members. I am willing to ask for clarification and ask for reasons to be explained clearly, and my attitude is often straightforward. In my work, I feel that many Party members have not treated me as an outsider, and I myself feel that I should not isolate myself. The straightforwardness of my attitude is also something that I thought I had learned from the Party members; it may be that some of my own individualism has been added, making it not upright enough.

Since studying the documents of the 20th Congress of the CPSU and launching criticism of the personality cult, I have raised a series of opinions regarding the abnormal attitude of non-Party members towards Party members. I realize that the CCP has consistently opposed the personality cult; however, some of us non-Party members have violated the Party's intentions and engaged in the personality cult. For example, the National Committee of the CPPCC once passed a motion to establish Mao Zedong University, and I also raised my hand in favor at the time; this motion was not implemented because of Chairman Mao's opposition. A party that builds its own happiness on the basis of "making others share happiness," a party that strives to liberate itself in the struggle for the liberation of the vast majority of working people and all mankind; it is forced to wage war in order to eliminate war forever, and it implements dictatorship in order to finally eliminate dictatorship. This series of great selfless spirits is easy for many people to fail to appreciate or not appreciate enough. Respect for revolutionary leaders and even for Party members is right and proper; this is something that is based on reason and after deliberation. This is fundamentally different from mythologizing revolutionary leaders and engaging in blind personality cult of Party members. The communiqué of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party required Party members to be vigilant against the unprincipled flattery of the bourgeoisie, considering it sugar-coated bullets. I have criticized those phenomena that use unprincipled flattery and personality cult to corrupt Party members. Obviously, this is completely different from the so-called "uglifying Party members." Originally, what reason do I have to uglify Party members? I work with Party members every day, how can I uglify Party members? Frankly speaking, I did uglify some people who flatter Party members. It is also very possible that my attitude was a bit excessive in this regard.

I will never be anti-Party or anti-socialist. I will be loyal to the Party and loyal to socialism until I die. Setting goals and making resolutions is something that everyone's subjectivity can determine. How can one imagine that a person who, in the dark era, under the coercion and temptation of the enemy in every possible way, refused to express anti-communism, would today turn around and oppose the Party? How can one imagine that a person who pursued socialism in the quagmire of capitalism would today, when the cause of socialism has achieved such brilliant victories, turn around and oppose socialism? In the past eight years, I have not been aware of relying on any political capital to engage in activities for fame and gain. I wholeheartedly rely on the Party and am willing to be an ordinary citizen who earns his own living under the Party's arrangement.

It is even said that I participated in the meeting held by Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji at Quanjude and promised to take a position in the future reactionary organization they were plotting. I must state that this is completely unfounded. In the past two years, I have only been to Quanjude Restaurant four times, all on occasions when relevant parties were hosting foreign guests. My actions are visible to all and can be investigated. When Wang Zao visited Beijing last time, I had a conversation with him once. When he mentioned restoring the National Salvation Association and solicited my consent, I immediately refused outright. I said, first, I left the National Salvation Association when I was in Chongqing, and I did not participate in the dissolution of the National Salvation Association, so I am not qualified to advocate restoring it today; second, I am not interested in the work of democratic parties, and participating in one Minjian is already too much, and I have repeatedly wanted to withdraw, so how can I be in the mood to engage in a second one? Third, my past cooperation with some comrades of the National Salvation Association was not good, and I cannot hope that the cooperation will be good in the future. How can we talk about taking on a position?

Some people believe: "Many voices can melt metal"; "Zeng Shen killed someone", repeated three times, even a loving mother would be shaken. I think this is a thing of the old era. Today, I believe: "True gold fears no fire"; with the leadership of the Communist Party, right and wrong can certainly be distinguished.

I have always believed that my problem is only a problem of thought; my mistake is only a theoretical error. Of course, if my theoretical error has caused fluctuations that exceed what the influence of the spirit of the times could have caused, then I should be responsible. I request the leadership to combine motive and effect, examine it, and give me the punishment I deserve.

Obviously, many people will enter socialism with bourgeois individualist ideas. But I, as a state cadre, should no longer have individualist ideas. I will definitely resolutely overcome my individualist ideas. I hope comrades will continue to help me!

    我的检讨
    章乃器的发言
    我是一个犯错误的人。我的错误的性质，是资产阶级的个人主义的思想和作风。的确，在解放以前，个人英雄主义对我是起了一些有益作用的。那时我正处在社会主义的理想与资本主义的现实环境的矛盾。依靠党对于我的领导，也依靠我那不与当时环境同流合污的个人英雄主义，我才能脱离泥坑，走上革命。在一九五二年，我曾经批判了我的个人主义。我认识到：即使它在旧时代曾经对我有用，今后是无论如何都要不得的了。我认识到：社会主义——集体主义，同个人主义是恰好对立的。在以后的三年多的时间内，我的个人主义有所克服。但，从一九五六年春苏共二十次代表大会以后，我的个人主义又有所滋长。更因为自恃不争名夺利，没有什么个人利己主义，反而助长了个人英雄主义和个人自由主义。具体表现在同许多方面的工作关系上甚至家庭关系上，都发生了不协调的情况。而这次在言论方面所发生的错误，正是同我的个人主义和片面乐观观点分不开的。那就是说：我把民族资产阶级分子的社会主义改造估计得太乐观了；同时，由于文章是从一系列反教条主义的争论当中发展起来的，带来了许多个人主义的意气，也就带来了片面性；还有，发表而不慎重估计影响，又犯了自由主义的作风。
    在学习了毛主席的讲演和周总理的政府工作报告以后，又得到许多同志的热情帮助，我在思想认识上有所提高；现在先就以下几个论点，加以检查纠正和澄清：
    一、定息不是剥削，而是不劳而获——我本来说：定息从私方人员的个人来说，是不劳而获，而不是剥削；从整个民族资产阶级来说，则是剥削的残余。这是根据过去已经有人肯定：工人阶级同民族资产阶级的矛盾，已经是非对抗性的矛盾，而引伸出来的。现在毛主席的讲演分析了：人民内部的矛盾，……在被剥削阶级和剥削阶级之间说来，除了对抗性的一面之外，还有非对抗性的一面。这一分析是十分正确的。从而，他在下文所说的：资本家还拿取定息，也就是还有剥削，也是十分正确的。我应该否定我本来的错误说法。
    二、资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子没有本质的区别——我的原文把“本质”解释为“本能的、先天的”，“与生俱来，至死方休的”。这种解释是片面夸张、脱离实际的。因而，根据这种错误解释而得出没有本质区别的结论，当然是错误的。一般对于“本质不同”的解释，应该是剥削同不剥削、反剥削有本质的区别。这种本质的区别当然是存在的。
    三、官僚主义是比资本主义更危险的敌人——我并没有说，社会主义必然带来官僚主义。恰恰相反，我认为“只要肃清‘三害’，就成为标准的社会主义的企业、机关”。但，某些右派分子已经把社会主义与官僚主义甚至“三害”之间画上了等号，我的说法容易同他们的说法混淆起来。我应该否定我的说法。
    四、民族资产阶级已经没有两面性——我没有这样说。我说它有两面性，但内容已经改变。我的说法还会有错误，当继续检查改正。
    五、工商业家不经过改造就可以爱社会主义——这不是我说的。我在“关于中国民族资产阶级的两面性问题”文内，单在（二）、（三）两段内，就有三次提到了党和政府的改造政策的胜利，而且还强调提出，“存在决定意识”，要看到“大存在”——人民力量的强大、社会主义经济力量的强大、祖国史无先例的统一与兴盛和社会主义阵营的日益团结与繁荣。
    其他还有需要纠正的错误论点，容我继续检查。对于理论上的错误，一经搞清楚，是可以毫不顾惜地加以否定的。
    我坦白承认，我极力主张缩短人民内部人与人之间的距离，以利于团结和工作。加上了我对于民族资产阶级分子社会主义改造的过分乐观的估计，片面强调提高他们的积极性的一面，就很可能带来混淆阶级界限的副作用。但我绝对不会愚蠢到认为资产阶级比工人阶级高明，资本家比工人好。我一贯主张工商业家需要在长时期内进行人的自我改造。我对于中国民族资产阶级的估价，总的是四句话：先天不足，后天失调，长有所用，死得其所。是说它在我们的时代里能够发挥一些有益的作用，最后能够在工人阶级的领导下消灭自己；这是好的。我不认为这是美化资产阶级。我始终认为它是比工人阶级落后的阶级。一个犯有严重的资产阶级个人主义的人，他在思想战线上肯定是属于右派的。但我经深刻检查，我同那些在政治上反党、反社会主义的右派分子，是没有任何共同之点的。
    许多同我接近过的人都可以证明，我经常是一个革命乐观主义者。我曾向许多人说过，解放以前，有三种威胁经常纠缠着我：一种是政治威胁——反动派随时可以杀害我；另一种是社会威胁——反动派可以指使流氓迫害我；还有一种是经济威胁——企业随时可以破产，陷于失业。解放后，这三种威胁都完全消失了。我现在只有一条心——做好党和国家交给我的工作；学习也是为着工作。我每天工作和学习的时间，往往超过十小时，为的就是社会主义。
    八年来，我的言论和行动同那些反党、反社会主义的右派分子的确是毫无相同之处的。第一，我从来没有夸大国家工作的缺点，抹煞国家工作的成绩。刚刚相反，我经常为每一点一滴的国家工作成绩而引以为荣；因为那当中有我的极其微末的贡献。第二，我坚信党和国家的强大，绝不相信匈牙利事件会在我国发生，而且从来也不打听学生可能闹事的消息。如果要检查我的思想的片面性，那只是片面的乐观，而绝不是什么悲观。第三，我参加各项工作、各种会议，以至到各地去视察，一贯地都是以主人翁的自觉，帮助领导上解决问题，而绝不遇事生非，到处点火。第四，对苏联和其他兄弟国家，我一贯表示最友好、最真诚的态度，没有丝毫违背“一边倒”的精神。第五，我从来也不搞什么小组织，从来也不争取私人的权利；对于国家和人民给我的荣誉和待遇，经常觉得已经过高，从来没有丝毫不满。因此认为必须夜以继日的劳动，做好工作，才能对得起党和国家。第六，在这次整风运动中我对党所提的意见，没有超出批判“三害”的范围，所指的只是某些和部分党员的缺点，而绝没有涉及全党和党中央的地方。我相信，目前那些对于我的流言，都会逐步得到澄清。
    八年来，我对党所提出的方针、政策，是没有任何怀疑的。不但没有怀疑，而且往往还觉得是出于意外的好。但在某些具体问题的看法上或者某些具体工作的做法上，我是提了不少不同的意见的，是做到了“知无不言、言无不尽”的。与党员的合作共事关系，绝大多数也是和谐的；但对于少数党员的态度、作风是有批评的。我愿意问清楚道理，要求讲清楚道理，态度往往是直率的。在工作上，我觉得许多党员都没有把我当作外人，我自己也觉得不应该自外。态度的直率也自以为是从党员那里学来的；可能加上了一些自己的个人主义，就不够端正。
    自从学习了苏共二十次代表大会文件，展开了对个人崇拜的批判以后，我提了一系列有关非党人士对党员态度不够正常的意见。我认识到，中共是一贯反对个人崇拜的；但，我们一部分非党人士却违反了党的意旨，进行个人崇拜。如政协全国委员会，就曾经通过一个设立毛泽东大学的议案，当时我也是举手赞成的；这个议案是因为毛主席的反对才没有实行的。一个把自己的幸福建筑在“使别人同享幸福”的基础上的党，一个努力于最大多数劳动人民与全人类的解放斗争中来解放自己的党；它被迫进行战争，为的是永远消灭战争，它实行专政，为的是最后消灭专政。这一系列大公无私的伟大精神是容易使许多人体会不了或者体会不够的。对革命领袖以至对党员的尊敬是应该的，这是经过鉴别基于理智的事情。这同神化革命领袖，以至对党员进行盲目的个人崇拜，是根本不同的两回事。党的七届二中全会的公报要求党员警惕资产阶级的无原则的捧场，认为那是糖衣炮弹。我曾经批判了那些用无原则的捧场和个人崇拜腐蚀党员的现象。显而易见，这与所谓“丑化党员”是完全不同的两回事。本来，我有什么理由丑化党员？我每天和党员在一起工作，怎能丑化党员？坦白地说，我的确丑化了一些对党员进行阿谀奉承的人。也很可能，我在这上面态度又有些过火了。
    我绝不会反党、反社会主义。我到死都是忠于党、忠于社会主义的。立志、下决心，是每一个人的主观可以决定的。那能设想，一个在黑暗时代，在敌人千方百计的威逼利诱之下，都不肯表示反共的人，今天反而要反党？那能设想，一个在资本主义的泥坑里就追求社会主义的人，在今天社会主义事业已经取得如此辉煌胜利的时候，反而要反社会主义？八年来，我丝毫也没有意识到要依靠什么政治资本搞争名夺利的勾当。我一心依靠党，愿在党的安排下做一名自食其力的普通公民。
    居然有人说我参加了章伯钧、罗隆基在全聚德召开的会议，而且答应在他们所策动的未来的反动组织中担任职务。我必须声明，这是完全没有根据的。近两年来，我一共只到过四次全聚德餐馆，都是有关方面宴请外宾的场合。我的行动是众目共见的，是可以调查的。王造时上次来京的时候，我曾和他谈过一次话。当他提到要恢复救国会，征求我的同意的时候，我即一口回绝。我说，第一，我在重庆时就离开了救国会，救国会解散我也没有与闻，今天没有资格主张恢复它；第二，我对民主党派工作没有兴趣，参加了一个民建已经嫌多，屡次想退出，那有心情再搞第二个？第三，我和救国会的某些同志过去合作得不好，今后也不能希望合作得好。那能谈得到什么担任职务呢？
    某些人相信：“众口可以烁金”；“曾参杀人”，重复了三次，慈母也为之动摇。我认为，这是旧时代的事情了。在今天，我相信：“真金不怕火”；有了共产党的领导，一定可以明是非。
    我始终认为：我的问题只是思想的问题；我的错误只是理论上的错误。当然，如果我的理论错误已经造成了超出时代思潮影响所可能引起的波动，那我应该负责。我请求领导上结合动机和效果，加以检查，给我以应得的处分。
    显而易见，会有许多人带着资产阶级的个人主义思想进入社会主义。但我，作为一个国家干部，却不应该再有个人主义思想。我一定坚决克服我的个人主义思想。希望同志们继续帮助我！
