The Wishes of a Textile Worker
Speech by Yi Shijuan

I am a textile worker from Shanghai. I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo. I feel immensely excited about the country's tremendous achievements over the past year. After I return, I will definitely take practical action, along with all the workers in the factory, to actively carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, ensuring quality, and strive to complete or over fulfill the production tasks for the final year of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

I express my utmost support for Premier Zhou’s powerful refutation of the reactionary remarks of the right-wingers in his report. Before I came to Beijing, the workers in our factory expressed great anger at the fallacies of the right-wingers, and they wanted me to refute these right-wingers at this solemn meeting. Ge Peiqi said: “The people’s lives are very hard now, and the living standards that have improved are those of the Party members and cadres who used to wear broken shoes but now ride in cars and wear woolen uniforms.” This is completely malicious provocation and does not correspond to the facts at all. Take us workers, for example. Before liberation, we had no political or economic status at all. We lived a life worse than animals. The wages we received could not even support ourselves. We lived in shacks and attics, and we couldn’t even afford pickles, let alone pork. Entering the factory was like entering a prison. We were often beaten and scolded. I was just an apprentice then, and at meal times, I had to endure the so-called education of “Na Me Wen” while hungry. Once, I couldn’t hold on and fainted. Every day at work, I was always worried about being fired, and my life had no guarantee.

After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we working people stood up. Our political status improved, and our economic lives improved. Working hours were shorter than before liberation, and wages increased. Now we live a life where we don’t have to worry about clothing and food. We can eat pork every day in the factory. Who says we can't afford pork? Many workers have also bought radios, watches, etc., which we could not have dreamed of before liberation. Isn't this an improvement? After liberation, we also enjoy labor insurance. The factory has established nurseries and clinics, built workers' dormitories and clubs. After work, we can watch movies and other cultural and recreational programs. The factory also runs spare-time schools for us to learn culture and technology. Before liberation, female workers were kicked out of the factory as soon as they gave birth, but after liberation, the government stipulated 56 days of maternity leave with full pay, and the factory took many measures to protect female workers. Women who are more than seven months pregnant can have breaks during work, and there are designated breastfeeding times for babies. All this shows that the Party and the government care for us workers in every possible way. Every worker understands that without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no happiness today. Without the Communist Party, we working people would never be able to stand up. But the right-wingers oppose the leadership of the Party and say, "Without the Communist Party, China would not perish." Obviously, they want to call New China back to the old ways, to make our working class still be exploited, oppressed, and live a life worse than animals. This is absolutely not allowed by us workers.

The right-wingers also say that "the Communist Party is not democratic." These are the ambitious people who oppose socialism, attack the Party, and want to seize leadership. The people can see very clearly that we have a staff representative meeting in our factory, which discusses work regularly. Workers can raise any opinions through the staff representatives. Female workers enjoy the same democratic rights as male workers. There are also production suggestion books in the workshops. Male and female workers can write down their opinions at any time so that the leaders can deal with the opinions of the masses in a timely manner. In order to unite the staff and do a good job in production, the leaders also take time to participate in physical labor, which makes us very moved. Everyone has improved their production enthusiasm. Isn't this democracy? Could all this have been done in the past? Only the Communist Party can do this. The right-wingers spread rumors everywhere, trying to provoke and undermine the relationship between our workers and the Party. We workers will never be deceived by them. We must be vigilant, closely unite around the Party, support the leadership of the Party, and smash all the conspiratorial activities of the right-wingers, and fight to the end to complete socialist construction.

Of course, there are some shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party and the government. Precisely because of this, the Party launched the rectification movement. Now I would like to raise a few points of opinion on the issues I have thought about.

1.  In recent years, the cotton textile industry has developed greatly, but due to the impact of natural disasters, the supply of raw cotton is not very normal. Sometimes we have to increase production, and sometimes we have to reduce production. When production is reduced, the leaders still pay wages in order to take care of the lives of the workers, which increases the burden on the country. I hope that the country can maintain a certain reserve.

2.  After liberation, the government spent a lot of funds to build many worker’s dormitories for the workers, but there is still not enough housing. Only one hundred or so households have been allocated to the factory, but there are more than seven hundred households registered. It is difficult to be satisfied because there are too many people who want housing. The factory trade union also wants to help workers with better economic conditions build their own housing, but it is impossible to get vacant land. The leaders in Shanghai always emphasize urban planning, and the construction of houses must be in a certain format.

I heard Vice Premier Bo Yibo mentioned in the 1957 national economic plan investment that standards should be lowered on the basis of ensuring quality, and employees should be encouraged to build their own workshops. This is very correct. Housing is indeed a big problem. If the government were to spend a large amount of money to build worker’s dormitories to solve the housing problems of all workers, it is obviously impossible at present. Therefore, we should try to solve it in many ways, and at the same time, I hope that the leaders in Shanghai will give support and solutions.

If there is anything wrong with the above opinions, please representatives criticize.

    纺织女工的心愿
    裔式娟的发言
    我是上海的纺织女工。我完全同意周总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理的报告。对国家一年来的巨大成就，我感到无限的兴奋。我回去后一定以实际行动与全厂工人一道，在保证质量的条件下，更积极地展开增产节约运动，争取提前或超额完成第一个五年计划最后一年生产任务。
    我对于周总理报告中对右派分子反动言论的有力驳斥，表示万分拥护。当我来北京以前，我们厂里的工人对右派分子的谬论，都表示很愤怒，他们要我在这次庄严的大会上来驳斥这些右派分子。葛佩琦说：现在人民的生活很苦，生活水平提高的是那些过去穿破鞋、现在坐小汽车穿呢制服的党员和干部，这完全是恶毒的挑拨，根本不符合事实。拿我们工人来说，解放前我们在政治上、经济上根本没有地位，我们过着牛马不如的生活，拿的工资连自己也养不活，住的是草棚、三层阁，吃的连咸菜都吃不上，更谈不上吃猪肉。进工厂就像进了监牢，常常挨打受骂。我那时还是个养成工，到吃饭的时候，还要饿着肚子受“拿么温”的所谓教育，有一次我支撑不住，就昏倒了。每天做工都是提心吊胆的，就怕被停生意，生活毫无保障。
    解放后，在共产党领导下，我们劳动人民站起来了，政治地位提高了，经济生活都有了改善，工作时间比解放以前缩短了，工资也有了增加。现在我们过着穿吃均不愁的生活，在工厂里我们每天都可以吃到猪肉，谁说吃不上猪肉呢？有许多工人还买了收音机、手表等，在解放前我们做梦也是想不到的，这难道不是改善吗？解放后，我们还享受到劳保，工厂办了托儿所、医务室，造了工人宿舍、俱乐部，我们下班后能看到电影和其他文娱节目，厂里还办了业余学校，给我们学习文化，学习技术。厂里的女工在解放前生小孩就被资本家一脚踢出厂门，解放后政府规定产后五十六天休息，工资照给，工厂里采取了许多措施保护女工。怀孕七个月以上可以工间休息，生了孩子每天规定喂奶时间，这一切都说明党和政府对我们工人的关怀是无微不至的，我们每个工人都明白，没有共产党领导，就不会有今天的幸福，没有共产党，我们劳动人民就永远翻不了身。可是右派分子却反对党的领导，说“没有共产党，中国也不会亡”。很明显，他们是要叫新中国回到过去的老样子，叫我们工人阶级仍然受剥削，受压迫，过牛马不如的生活，这是我们工人绝对不容许的。
    右派分子还说“共产党不民主”，这是这些野心家反对社会主义，向党进攻，想夺取领导权。人民看得很清楚，我们工厂里就有职工代表会议，定期讨论工作，工人有什么意见都可以经过职工代表去提出，女工们和男工一样充分享受了民主的权利。车间里还有生产意见书，男女工人有意见可随时写上去，使领导上对群众的意见能做到即时处理。为了团结职工搞好生产，领导上还抽出时间参加体力劳动，这使得我们非常感动，大家都提高了生产热情，这难道不是民主吗？这一切过去能做得到吗？只有共产党，才能这样做。右派分子到处造谣，想挑拨破坏我们工人群众和党的关系，我们工人决不会受他们的欺骗，我们要提高警惕，紧密的团结在党的周围拥护党的领导，击破一切右派分子的阴谋活动，为完成社会主义建设斗争到底。
    当然在党和政府的工作中是有些缺点和错误的。正是为了这样，党才开展整风运动，现在我想就我所想到的问题，提几点意见。
    1、几年来棉纺织工业有了很大发展，但由于自然灾害的影响，原棉供应不很正常，有时要增产，有时要减产，减产时领导上为了照顾工人生活，工资还要付给，增加了国家的负担，希望国家能保持一定的储备量。
    2、解放后，政府曾经拿出了不少经费为工人建造了许多工房，但是住房还是不够，分配到厂里的房子只有一百多户，但登记的就有七百多户，要分得满意很困难，因为要房子的人太多了。厂工会也想帮助经济条件比较好的工人自建，于是空地也要不到，上海领导上总是强调城市规划，造房子要按一定的格式。
    我听了薄一波副总理在一九五七年国民经济计划投资中提到，在保证质量的基础上应降低标准，并鼓励职工自建工房，这是很正确的，住房确实是一个大的问题，如果要政府再拿出大批钱来造工人宿舍，解决所有工人的住房问题，在目前显然是不可能的，因此应该从多方面设法解决，同时希望上海的领导上给于支持和解决。
    以上意见，如有不对的地方，请代表提出批评。
