I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government, as well as the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, President Dong Biwu, and Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng. Now I will express some opinions on counterattacking right-wingers.

Without the Communist Party, there would be no good life

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the working class of our country and the people of the whole country have achieved a great victory in the socialist revolution. Socialist transformation has been basically completed nationwide, and socialist construction is steadily advancing on an expanding basis. Our country is now unprecedentedly prosperous and powerful. The lives of our people, especially the workers and peasants, have been significantly improved. These obvious facts fully prove the correctness of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, the people of our country would not have the good life we have today.

Currently, the people of our country are closely united around the Chinese Communist Party and are striving to build our motherland into a great socialist country. Building socialism is in the best interests of the people of the whole country and is the noble goal and sacred cause of the people of the whole country. Taking the socialist road is the firm and unshakable will of the people of the whole country. Therefore, Chairman Mao Zedong instructed us: "All words and deeds that deviate from socialism are completely wrong."

The vanguard of the working class of our country—the Chinese Communist Party—is the core force leading our country. It has won the heartfelt love and enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country. It is great, glorious, and correct. However, the Chinese Communist Party has never concealed its shortcomings and mistakes in its work. It has consistently grasped the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, followed the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, and combined it with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution to struggle for the interests of the Chinese people. Apart from the interests of the people, the Chinese Communist Party has no selfish interests. Precisely because of this, the Chinese Communist Party has never been afraid of criticism from outside the Party. After the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on the rectification movement on April 27 this year, the Party openly welcomed non-Party figures to help the Party rectify its work, and welcomed non-Party figures to criticize the bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism existing among Party members. What a bright and selfless act, only the political party of the working class can do this.

The right-wing's fallacies are poison gas bombs

Non-Party figures helping the Party rectify its work and making criticisms of the Party should have been aimed at consolidating the Party's leadership and achieving greater success in the socialist cause. Indeed, the vast majority of non-Party figures held this wish. They put forward criticisms to the Party based on the principle of "unity—criticism—unity," speaking freely and without reservation. However, during the great blooming and contending, a group of monsters and demons also emerged, and a batch of poisonous weeds was released. The bourgeois right-wingers took advantage of the Party's rectification movement with ulterior motives and exploited the loopholes. They feared that the world would not be in chaos, set fires everywhere, reversed black and white, confused right and wrong, and fiercely launched poisonous arrows at the Party. Their purpose was to fundamentally shake the Party's leadership, overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship, and restore capitalism in our country. This sinister conspiracy, judging from the recent successive exposures of the inside story of the Zhang-Luo alliance, is truly shocking and appalling. These right-wing careerists who vainly attempted to seize power, hated the Chinese Communist Party, hated the people's democratic dictatorship, they had been plotting for a long time, with organization, plans, programs, lines, and actions, painstakingly trying to usurp the leadership of the Party. From this point of view, the fallacies they uttered were by no means momentary impulses or slips of the tongue, but cleverly disguised poison gas bombs. Just look, aren't the Chiang gang's reactionary radio stations and newspapers in Taiwan and Hong Kong cheering them on! How can the working class of the whole country and the people of the whole country sit idly by and not launch a powerful counterattack against this frenzied attack by the bourgeois right-wingers?

It is worth noting that the right-wingers vainly attempted to set fire among the workers and peasants, inciting their dissatisfaction with the Party and the government. They said that "workers and peasants are the lifeline of the Communist Party," and shouted loudly to "put the focus of blooming and contending on the grassroots." Some right-wingers even clamored that trade unions should not be specialized in following the Communist Party's lead, but should play the role of an "opposition party," attempting to make trade unions break away from the Party's leadership. But I want to solemnly tell these right-wing gentlemen that your calculations are wrong. The broad masses of workers and peasants have the clearest eyes and the keenest sense of smell. Even if you are full of tricks, the broad masses of workers and peasants already know from their own personal experience that the Communist Party is their savior. The broad masses of workers across the country have roared at the right-wingers and launched a counterattack against the provocations of the right-wingers. The workers said that today's world is the world of the people, we and the Communist Party are of one mind and one soul, and we hope that those who are not clear about the situation will open their eyes and see clearly that whoever wants to shake the leadership of the Communist Party, we will fight him to the death! The workers' powerful counterattack gave the right-wing careerists a head-on blow. Under the bright eyes of the broad masses of workers and peasants, the bourgeois right-wingers have been exposed in their true colors, just like in a demon-revealing mirror.

The personal life experiences of the broad masses of workers

You must know that the workers and peasants have a long-term, flesh-and-blood intimate relationship with the Communist Party, and no amount of provocation can separate them. Why do the workers say "we and the Communist Party are of one mind and one soul"? This is not difficult to understand. Because the broad masses of workers know from their own personal life experiences that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can they ultimately liberate themselves, and only by closely following the Communist Party can they live a free, happy, and fulfilling life. That is the fact. In the old society, Chinese workers suffered cruel exploitation and oppression, were inadequately clothed, poorly fed, and had no democratic or free rights, living a slave life worse than that of cattle and horses. The Communist Party came, liberated them, and the workers became the masters of the new China. Isn't the first article of our solemn constitution clearly written: "The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." Among the more than 1,000 representatives of the National People's Congress, the highest organ of state power in our country, there are 129 representatives of workers and trade union systems. This fully demonstrates the improvement of the workers' political status. I would also like to briefly list a few facts to illustrate the improvement of workers' lives after liberation.

Workers' wage income has been continuously increasing, and the rate of increase is not slow. During the period of national economic recovery, from 1950 to 1952, the average money wage of workers and staff in the national industrial sector increased by 57.7 percent. The First Five-Year Plan stipulated that the average wage of workers and staff nationwide should increase by 33 percent. As a result of the implementation of the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, it increased by 33.5 percent in 1956 compared with 1952. The average annual wage of workers and staff nationwide in 1952 was 446 yuan, and it increased to 610 yuan in 1956. The total wage bill of workers and staff in our country has also increased a lot in recent years. For example, taking 1952 as 100, it was 140 in 1953, 159 in 1954, 179 in 1955, and 229 in 1956. Aren't these figures enough to show that workers' wages are constantly increasing?

In our country, there are many measures to increase the income of workers and staff and improve their lives. In addition to raising money wages, the state also expands health care services year by year, strengthens labor protection work, builds a large number of workers' and staff's residences, adds cultural and educational facilities, expands labor employment, and so on.

The number of workers and staff nationwide covered by labor insurance has been increasing rapidly year by year. By the end of 1956, 8 million workers and staff nationwide had implemented labor insurance. In enterprises and institutions that have not yet implemented the labor insurance regulations, other forms have been used to solve the difficulties of workers and staff in terms of birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability, such as state organs and schools implementing free medical care and other welfare measures, and many enterprises signing labor insurance contracts. With the continuous development of socialist construction, the state's expenditure on labor insurance has increased year by year. For example, taking 1951 as 100, it was 200 in 1952, 500 in 1953, 600 in 1954, 630 in 1955, and 810 in 1956. According to the provisions of the First Five-Year Plan, the state's expenditure on labor insurance funds, medical expenses, welfare expenses, and cultural and educational expenses for state-owned enterprises and state organs reached more than 5 billion yuan. The above-mentioned expenses paid by the state for workers and staff each year averaged 17 percent of the total wage bill of workers and staff. Aren't these facts enough to show that only in socialist countries can the birth, old age, illness, death, injury, and disability of workers and staff be guaranteed?

Before liberation, workers had no sanatoriums or convalescent homes of their own at all. After liberation, the people's government confiscated the villas of bureaucratic capitalists as workers' sanatoriums; at the same time, with the strong support of the people's government, labor insurance funds were used to build many sanatoriums and convalescent homes for workers. According to statistics at the end of 1956, there were 164 sanatoriums and convalescent homes run by the trade union system, with 23,775 beds. In 1956 alone, more than 100,000 workers and staff underwent sanatorium and convalescent care. In addition, more than 1,000 amateur sanatoriums (convalescent homes) were also run. The sanatoriums and convalescent homes run by the trade union played a good role in protecting and restoring the physical health of workers and staff.

Improving working conditions and protecting the safety and health of workers in the production process is a fundamental policy of our country. At present, the vast majority of enterprises nationwide have implemented an eight-hour workday and a one-day-off public holiday system per week. In many factories and mines, special attention is also paid to the protection of female workers. Female workers are prohibited from being used for particularly heavy work or work that hinders their reproductive function. In general production work, some enterprises implement protective measures for pregnant female workers, such as reducing their workload or changing to lighter work. In the production process, dangerous parts of mechanical rotation, boilers, variable-pressure containers, electrical equipment, etc., generally have protective devices and safety equipment. 90 percent of state-owned coal mines and most non-ferrous metal mines have adopted mechanical ventilation. Factories such as iron and steel smelting, chemical industry, and textiles, as well as workshops that produce high temperatures, radiant heat, dust, and harmful fumes, generally have ventilation, exhaust, heat insulation, cooling, or mechanization and sealing measures. According to statistics from 1953 to 1955 alone, the five departments of heavy industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, textiles, and railways allocated a total of 122.225 million yuan for improving working conditions; statistics in 1956 showed that 1,721 factories and mines allocated more than 33.32 million yuan in accordance with labor protection agreements. All these measures have played a huge role in protecting the safety and health of workers and staff.

Housing is one of the issues that is most closely related to the lives of workers and staff. Before liberation, the living conditions of workers and staff were extremely poor, or they simply had no houses to live in. After liberation, the state allocated large sums of money to build houses for workers and staff, solving the housing problems of many workers and staff. According to the provisions of the First Five-Year Plan, the area of ​​workers' and staff's residences to be built was 46.01 million square meters, while in the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, 61 million square meters were built, exceeding the area stipulated in the Five-Year Plan by 32.58 percent. In addition to the state investing in the construction of workers' and staff's residences, some departments have also adopted the method of self-construction with public assistance to help workers and staff build economical and practical residences. Aren't the above facts enough to show the Party and the government's concern for the health, safety, and living conditions of workers and staff?

In recent years, trade union organizations have paid attention to working with workers and staff to find ways, relying on the strength of the masses themselves, to carry out various mass mutual assistance and mutual aid activities to help workers and staff solve various difficulties that arise from time to time in their lives. For example, according to statistics from January to June 1956, 31,471 workers' and staff's mutual assistance savings societies were established at the grassroots level, with more than 4 million participants, a fund of more than 30.39 million yuan, and more than 4.59 million people borrowing, with a loan amount of more than 56.86 million yuan. In 1956, 30,911 family mutual assistance groups were organized at the grassroots level, with more than 360,000 family members participating. The forms and content of mass mutual assistance and mutual aid are diverse. Experience has proved that this is an effective way for workers and staff to solve certain life difficulties by relying on their own strength, and it is an important auxiliary method for trade unions to cooperate with the state to vigorously improve the lives of workers and staff.

The Party and the government also attach deep concern to the cultural and technical education and cultural and sports activities of workers and staff, and trade union organizations have also carried out huge work in this regard. According to statistics in 1956, there were 9,399 workers' and staff's spare-time cultural schools nationwide, with more than 5 million workers and staff participating in spare-time cultural studies. In 1956, the 18 central industrial ministries had a total of 212 technical schools, with 112,000 students. According to statistics in 1955, there were a total of 12,988 workers' cultural palaces and clubs, 1,735 film projectors, 27 workers' professional troupes, 4,898 amateur troupes, and 18 national workers' sports associations. These facilities and activities have played a significant role in improving the cultural and technical level of workers and staff and enriching their cultural life. Aren't these facts enough to show that the Party and the government attach deep concern not only to the livelihood and welfare of workers and staff, but also to their cultural life?

The increase in the number of employed workers since our country's liberation has been astonishing. In the early days of liberation, the number of workers and staff in our country was only 7.257 million. With the recovery and development of the national economy, the ranks of workers and staff in our country have now developed to 24 million. From 1949 to 1956, the average annual increase in workers and staff was about 1.3 million. This rate of increase in the number of employed workers is unprecedented in our country and rare in the world.

Only in socialist countries can the lives of workers and staff be improved like this

The above-mentioned ironclad facts of improving the lives of workers and staff fully refute the absurd lies of the right-wingers. The improvement in the lives of workers and staff is inseparable from the active efforts of the working masses, and it is inseparable from the leadership of the Party. Likewise, this is only possible in socialist countries. Of course, the current living standards of workers and staff in our country are still not high, and there are still some difficulties in the lives of a small number of workers and staff. However, in our socialist country, the system of human exploitation has been abolished. As long as workers and staff continue to improve labor productivity and continuously develop the country's construction, the material and cultural lives of workers and staff will continue to improve. Our working class understands best that only labor can create material wealth, and only labor can develop culture and art. Our country was still in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state not long ago, and its foundation was too poor and too backward. How can the improvement of the lives of workers and peasants reach the sky in one step? Precisely because of this, the people of the whole country are determined to build socialism under the leadership of the Communist Party, from one five-year plan to another, to create our increasingly happy and fulfilling life. Even if our generation has to endure temporary difficulties, our descendants will live carefree in a paradise. As the saying goes: the predecessors plant trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade. That is exactly what the workers and staff of our country think. Now, the workers and staff of the whole country are enthusiastically responding to the Party's call, continuing to carry forward the revolutionary fine tradition of hard work, implementing the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and launching a vigorous movement to increase production and practice economy and an advanced producer movement. These efforts are to build our motherland into a great socialist country, so that our lives will be increasingly fulfilling and happy.

The right-wingers have two roads in front of them, where to go?

Today, the bourgeois right-wingers are closing their eyes, obliterating the facts, and attempting to deny the glorious achievements the Party has made in state affairs and deny the superiority of socialism. They vainly attempt to usurp state power from the working-class party—the Communist Party—to make the country deviate from the socialist road and to make the working people return to the previous miserable life of being exploited and oppressed. We want to solemnly tell all right-wingers that the socialist force has become incomparably strong, the people's democratic system is as stable as a rock, and the people of the whole country are united like giants, marching towards socialism with full confidence under the leadership of the Communist Party. All the conspiracies of the right-wingers can only be as futile as a mantis trying to stop a chariot.

We will never allow the right-wingers to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, and we will never allow the conspiracy of capitalist restoration to succeed. Premier Zhou Enlai has systematically and solemnly criticized the anti-socialist words and deeds of the bourgeois right-wingers in his report on the work of the government, and has pointed out the way out for the right-wingers. Now there are two roads in front of the right-wingers: one is to surrender and honestly confess their problems, and truly accept the leadership of the Communist Party and take the socialist road; the other is to play tricks, muddle through, and continue to carry out conspiracies and sabotage. The former is the correct road, and the latter is the road to self-destruction from the people. Which way to go, the right-wingers should choose for themselves. The workers and staff of our country must carry the struggle against the right-wingers through to the end, and we must achieve victory before we give up!

### 全国职工一定要把反对右派分子的斗争进行到底  朱学范的发言

专栏：

    全国职工一定要把反对右派分子的斗争进行到底
    朱学范的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告，以及李先念、薄一波副总理、董必武院长、张鼎丞检察长所作的各项报告。现在我就反击右派分子，发表一些意见。没有共产党就没有美好生活
    我国工人阶级和全国人民，在中国共产党的领导下，已经取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利。社会主义改造在全国范围内已经基本上完成，社会主义建设在不断扩大的基础上稳步地前进。我们的国家现在是空前的繁荣，空前的强大。我国人民的生活，特别是工人农民的生活，已经得到显著的改善。这些有目共睹的事实，充分证明了中国共产党领导的正确。没有共产党，我们全国人民就没有今天的美好生活。
    当前我国人民紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，正在为着把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。建设社会主义，符合于全国人民的最大利益，是全国人民的崇高目标和神圣事业。走社会主义的道路，是全国人民坚定不移的意志。因此，毛泽东主席指示我们：“一切离开社会主义的言论行动是完全错误的。”
    我国工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党，是领导我们国家的核心力量。它获得了全国人民的衷心爱戴和热烈拥护。它是伟大的，光荣的，正确的。但是中国共产党从来就不隐讳自己在工作中的缺点和错误，它一贯地掌握着批评和自我批评的武器，遵循着马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，并结合着中国革命的具体实践，为着中国人民的利益而奋斗。除了人民的利益，中国共产党别无私自的利益。正因为这样，中国共产党从来就不怕来自党外的批评。今年四月二十七日中共中央发出关于整风运动的指示以后，党公开欢迎非党人士帮助党整风，欢迎非党人士对于党员中存在着的官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义展开批评。这是何等的光明磊落和大公无私，只有工人阶级的政党才能这样做。
    右派的谬论是毒气弹
    党外人士帮助党整风，对党提出批评意见，本来应当从巩固党的领导、使社会主义事业得到更大的成就出发。的确，绝大多数的党外人士是抱着这种愿望的，他们本着“团结——批评——团结”的方针对党提出批评，畅所欲言，毫无顾忌。但是在大鸣大放中，也鸣出了一批牛鬼蛇神，放出了一批毒草。资产阶级右派分子利用党开展整风的时机，别具用心，大钻空子。他们惟恐天下不乱，到处点火，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，向党狠狠地施放毒箭。其目的是要根本动摇党的领导，推翻人民民主专政，使资本主义在我国复辟。这种恶毒的阴谋，从最近接连揭露章罗联盟的内幕来看，真是骇人听闻、令人惊心动魄。这些妄图夺取权力的右派野心家，敌视中国共产党，敌视人民民主专政，他们密谋已久，有组织、有计划、有纲领、有路线、有行动，处心积虑地要篡夺党的领导权。由此看来，他们发出的谬论决不是一时的冲动或失言，而是巧妙地伪装着的毒气弹。试看，台湾和香港的蒋帮反动电台和报刊，不是正在为他们打气、喝彩么！全国工人阶级和全国人民，对于资产阶级右派分子的这种猖狂进攻，怎能坐视不予有力的反击呢？
    值得注意的是，右派分子妄想在工农群众中点火，煽动工农群众对党和政府的不满。他们说“工农是共产党的命根子”，大叫“把鸣放重点放到基层去”。有的右派分子还叫嚣工会不要专做共产党的尾巴，要起“反对党”的作用，企图使工会脱离党的领导。但是我要正告这些右派先生们，你们的算盘是打错了。广大的工人和农民，眼睛看得最清楚，嗅觉也灵敏。纵然你们诡计多端，广大的工农群众已经从自己的切身经验中，知道共产党是他们的救星。全国广大的工人群众已经向右派分子发出怒吼，对于右派分子的挑衅群起而反击。工人说，今日的天下是人民的天下，我们和共产党是一条命一条心，希望那些认识不清的人睁开眼睛看清楚，谁要动摇共产党的领导，我们就要跟他拚命！工人的有力反击，给右派野心家以当头棒喝。资产阶级右派分子在工农群众的雪亮眼睛注视下，像在照妖镜里一样，已经原形毕露了。
    广大工人的切身生活经验
    要知道，工农群众同共产党有着长期的血肉般的亲密关系，任何挑拨离间都不能把他们分离开来。为什么工人要说“我们和共产党是一条命一条心”呢？这是不难理解的。因为广大的工人群众从他们自己的切身生活经验中知道，只有在共产党领导下他们才能最终解放自己，只有紧紧地跟着共产党走才能过自由、幸福和美满的生活。事实就是这样。中国工人在旧社会里受着残酷的剥削和压迫，衣不蔽体，食不果腹，毫无民主自由权利，过着牛马不如的奴隶生活。共产党来了，解放了，工人成了新中国的主人。我国庄严的宪法的第一条，不就是明明白白地写着：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。”我们国家的最高权力机关全国人民代表大会的一千多名代表中，就有一百二十九名工人和工会系统的代表。这就充分地表明了工人政治地位的提高。我还想概括地列举几件事实，说明解放后工人生活的提高。
    工人的工资收入，不断有所增长，而且增长的速度是不慢的。在国民经济恢复时期，一九五○年到一九五二年全国工业部门职工的货币平均工资增加了百分之五十七点七。第一个五年计划规定全国职工的平均工资提高百分之三十三，五年计划前四年执行的结果，一九五六年比一九五二年增加了百分之三十三点五。一九五二年全国职工的年平均工资为四百四十六元，一九五六年提高到六百一十元。我国职工工资总额，几年来也是增加很多的。如以一九五二年为一百，一九五三年为一百四十，一九五四年为一百五十九，一九五五年为一百七十九，一九五六年为二百二十九。难道这些数字还不足以说明职工工资在不断提高吗？
    在我国，增加职工收入和改善职工生活的措施是多方面的。除了提高货币工资以外，国家还逐年扩充保健医疗事业，加强劳动保护工作，大量修建职工住宅，增添文化教育设施，扩大劳动就业，等等。
    全国实行劳动保险的职工人数是逐年迅速增加的，到一九五六年年底为止，全国已有八百万职工实行了劳动保险。在尚未实行劳动保险条例的企业和机关里，都用其他形式解决了职工的生、老、病、死、伤、残等困难问题，如国家机关和学校实行公费医疗和其他福利办法，许多企业签订劳动保险合同。随着社会主义建设的不断发展，国家用于劳动保险的费用逐年增加，如以一九五一年为一百，则一九五二年为二百，一九五三年为五百，一九五四年为六百，一九五五年为六百三十，一九五六年为八百一十。根据第一个五年计划的规定，国家用于国营企业和国家机关的劳动保险金、医药费、福利费和文教费的开支达五十亿元以上，国家每年为职工支出的上述各项费用平均相当于职工工资总额的百分之十七。难道这些事实，还不足以说明只有在社会主义国家里职工的生、老、病、死、伤、残，才有可能获得保障吗？
    解放前工人根本没有自己的疗养院和休养所。解放后人民政府没收了官僚资产阶级的别墅做为工人疗养院；同时在人民政府的大力支持下，用劳动保险金为工人修建了不少疗养院和休养所。根据一九五六年底的统计，工会系统举办的疗养院和休养所有一百六十四所，二万三千七百七十五张床位。仅一九五六年一年，经过疗养、休养的职工就有十万多人。此外，还举办了一千余处业余疗养（休养）所。工会举办的疗养院和休养所，在保障和恢复职工身体健康方面起了良好的作用。
    改善劳动条件，保护劳动者在生产过程中的安全和健康，是我国的一项根本政策。目前全国绝大多数企业都已经实行八小时工作日和每周休息一天的公休制度。在许多厂矿企业里，还特别重视女工的保护工作，对特殊繁重或有碍女工生育机能的工作，禁止使用女工；在一般的生产工作中，有些企业对怀孕女工实行减轻工作或调换轻工作的保护办法。在生产过程中，机械转动的危险部分、锅炉、变压容器、电气设备等，一般都有了防护装置和安全设备。国营煤矿有百分之九十的矿井和大部分有色金属矿，都采用了机械通风。钢铁冶炼、化工、纺织等工厂以及产生高温、辐射热、粉尘、有害烟雾等车间，一般都有了通风排气、隔热、防暑降温或者机械化、密闭化等措施。仅据一九五三年到一九五五年的统计，重工业、一机、二机、纺织、铁路五个部门用于改善劳动条件的拨款共计一亿二千二百二十五万元；一九五六年统计一千七百二十一个厂矿根据劳动保护协议书拨款为三千三百三十二万余元。所有这些措施，对职工的安全和健康起了巨大的保护作用。
    居住问题是同职工生活关系最密切的问题之一。解放以前，职工的居住条件是极其恶劣的，或者就是根本没有房子居住。解放以后，国家拨出大批款项给职工建筑住宅，解决了很多职工的居住问题。根据第一个五年计划的规定，建筑职工住宅面积为四千六百零一万平方米，而第一个五年计划的前四年就建筑了六千一百万平方米，已经超过了五年计划规定面积百分之三十二点五八。除了由国家投资建筑职工住宅外，有些部门还采用了自建公助的办法，帮助职工建筑经济适用的住宅，难道上述这些事实还不足以说明党和政府对职工健康、安全和居住条件的关心吗？
    几年来，工会组织注意了和职工共同想办法，依靠群众自己的力量，举办各种群众性的互助互济活动，帮助职工解决生活中不时发生的各种困难。例如根据一九五六年一月至六月的统计，在基层单位建立了职工互助储金会三万一千四百七十一个，参加人数四百余万人，基金三千零三十九万余元，借款人数四百五十九万余人次，借款金额五千六百八十六万余元。一九五六年在基层单位组织起来的家属互助组有三万零九百一十一个，参加的家属有三十六万余人。群众互助互济的形式和内容是多种多样的，经验证明，这是职工依靠自己的力量解决某些生活困难的有效方法，是工会配合国家大力改善职工生活的重要辅助方式。
    党和政府对于职工的文化技术教育和文化体育活动也寄以深切的关怀，工会组织在这方面也进行了巨大的工作。根据一九五六年的统计，全国有职工业余文化学校九千三百九十九所，参加业余文化学习的职工有五百多万人。一九五六年中央十八个工业部共有技工学校二百一十二所，学员十一万二千人。根据一九五五年的统计，全国共有工人文化宫、俱乐部一万二千九百八十八个，电影放映机一千七百三十五台，工人专业剧团二十七个，业余剧团四千八百九十八个，全国性的职工体育协会十八个。这些设备和活动，对于提高职工的文化技术水平，丰富职工的文化生活，起了显著的作用。难道这些事实，还不足以说明党和政府对职工群众除了生活福利以外，在文化生活上，也是寄予深切关怀的吗？
    自从我国解放以来劳动就业人数的增加是惊人的。在解放初期，我国职工人数只有七百二十五万七千人，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，现在我国的职工队伍已经发展到二千四百万人，从一九四九年到一九五六年，平均每年新增职工约为一百三十多万人。劳动就业人数的这种增加速度，在我国是空前的，在世界各国也是少有的。
    只有在社会主义的国家职工生活才有这样的改善
    上述这些改善职工生活的铁般事实，充分驳斥了右派分子的无稽谰言。职工生活能够得到这样的改善，是和工人群众的积极努力分不开的，是和党的领导分不开的，同样，只有在社会主义的国家才有这种可能。当然，目前我国职工的生活水平仍然是不高的，少部分职工生活还存在着一些困难。但是，在我们的社会主义国家里，已经废除了人剥削人的制度，只要职工不断提高劳动生产率，不断发展国家的建设事业，职工的物质、文化生活就会得到不断的提高。我们工人阶级最能懂得，只有劳动才能创造物质财富，只有劳动才能发展文化艺术。我们的国家不久以前还处于半封建半殖民地的地位，底子太穷太落后，工人农民生活的改善怎能一步登天？正因为这样，全国人民坚决地要在共产党领导之下建设社会主义，从一个五年计划到另一个五年计划，缔造我们日益幸福日益美满的生活。纵然我们这一代人还要忍受一时的困难，我们的后辈子孙却要无忧无虑地生活在一个极乐世界里。正如俗语所说的：前人种树后人乘凉。我们全国职工正是这样想的。现在全国职工热烈响应党的号召，继续发扬艰苦奋斗的革命优良传统，贯彻勤俭建国的方针，轰轰烈烈地开展着增产节约运动和先进生产者运动。这些努力，就是要把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，使我们的生活日益美满和幸福。
    右派分子面前有两条路，何去何从？
    今天资产阶级右派分子，竟然闭着眼睛，抹煞事实，企图否定党在国家事务中所获得的辉煌成就，否定社会主义的优越性。他们妄想把国家政权从工人阶级的政党——共产党手中篡夺过去，使国家背离社会主义道路，使劳动人民再回到从前那种被剥削被压迫的悲惨生活中去。我们要正告一切右派分子，社会主义力量已经无比强大，人民民主制度已经稳如磐石，全国人民团结得像巨人一样，在共产党的领导之下，满怀信心地走向社会主义。右派分子的一切阴谋活动，只能像螳臂挡车一样是徒劳枉然的。
    我们决不容许右派分子向党进行猖狂进攻，我们决不容许资本主义复辟阴谋得逞。周恩来总理在政府工作报告中已经系统地严正批判了资产阶级右派反社会主义的言论和行动，并且给右派分子指明了出路。现在摆在右派分子面前的有两条路：一条是举手投降，老老实实地交代问题，真正接受共产党的领导和走社会主义的道路；另一条是耍花枪，蒙混过关，继续施展阴谋和捣乱。前者是正确的道路，后者是自绝于人民的道路。何去何从，右派分子自己去选择。我们全国职工一定要把反对右派分子的斗争进行到底，一定要取得胜利才罢休！
