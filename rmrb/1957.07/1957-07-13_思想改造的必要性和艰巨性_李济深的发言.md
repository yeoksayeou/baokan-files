I fully agree with Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government and the reports of other responsible comrades.

Since the founding of our country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have achieved a decisive victory in the socialist revolution. The first Five-Year Plan will be completed and overfulfilled this year. In this short period, the private ownership of the means of production has been changed, exploitation has been eliminated, productive forces have been developed, the people's living standards have been improved, and our international status has been elevated. The common aspirations that the people of the whole country have long yearned to realize are now being gradually realized. How can one not be filled with joy and encouragement in the face of this fact?

We know that China is a large country with a population of 600 million, with a backward economy, backward culture, and a great lack of construction experience. It is certainly difficult to quickly build our country into a socialist industrial power on such a basis. At the same time, some errors and shortcomings will inevitably occur in the work process. However, as long as the people of the whole country unite as one, uphold the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, work hard, accumulate experience, improve our work, and bring into play all forces that can be brought into play, we are fully confident that we will certainly be able to correct errors and shortcomings, overcome difficulties, and advance victoriously in our work.

Those who only see small shortcomings and do not see great achievements can truly be said to be "able to see the tip of an autumn hair but not a cartload of firewood"; as for those who intentionally exaggerate shortcomings and deny achievements, they are simply ill-intentioned and have ulterior motives.

In the process of socialist transformation and socialist construction, the emergence of a small number of right-wing elements who oppose socialism, oppose the leadership of the Party, exaggerate shortcomings, and negate achievements is not accidental. Because since the basic completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, capitalist industry and commerce, and the decisive victory of the socialist revolution, the five economic sectors that once coexisted have been transformed into a single socialist economy. This is a huge transformation of the material foundation. The general trend and the will of the people are irresistible. However, the transformation of the economic material foundation does not mean that the superstructure will be transformed at the same time, nor does it mean that people's old ideas will immediately change accordingly. The transformation of ideas still requires a process. Therefore, after the transformation of the material foundation, it is necessary to strengthen ideological remolding, especially the ideological remolding of the old intellectuals, to adapt to the development of the new situation, so that they will not have ideological conflicts with new things.

In this great socialist transformation, intellectuals who have been subjected to the ideological influence of the old society for a long time, and intellectuals from feudal landlord class, petty-bourgeois, and bourgeois families, have shown various political attitudes. Some people, with the progress of society, have continuously improved their ideological awareness in the revolutionary practice of the past few years, and have been able to keep up with the progress of the times. Therefore, they have played an active role and contributed their strength in the cause of socialist transformation and construction. Another type of people, although they also played some role in the democratic revolution stage, their thinking has not progressed with the progress of society. Therefore, they have a vague understanding of new things, and even sometimes have conflicting emotions. There is also a kind of people, for eight years, the old ideas, the old consciousness, deeply rooted and unchanged. They always miss the past, feel that the old is better than the new, and have no affection for the new society at all. They always want to pull the wheel of history backward, trying to build their reactionary "paradise" according to their old bourgeois "blueprint." In addition, their personal bad qualities and political ambitions are at play, and finally they develop from dissatisfaction with the new society to the path of anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialism. In 1948, didn't they issue a statement supporting the convening of the New Political Consultative Conference and supporting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party? Now they have forgotten about it. In 1949, didn't they participate in the formulation and raise their hands to approve the Common Program? Now they have also forgotten about it. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, they have not expressed their unreserved approval and support for the discussion of the general line of the state's transition period, the formulation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and the decisions on various major policies and guidelines? Now they have also forgotten about it. Especially on the banner jointly presented by the democratic parties on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, didn't everyone unanimously agree to write the solemn words "Always follow the Chinese Communist Party"? Now they have also forgotten about it. The above facts are still fresh in my memory, but they have long forgotten the solemn political promises they made in the past, using the name of helping the Chinese Communist Party to rectify its work style, publishing many absurd remarks against the Party, the people, and socialism, and carrying out a series of conspiratorial activities, attempting to restore capitalism in China. This is an act of "disrespecting one's word" and "breaking faith and abandoning righteousness." Figures like Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Long Yun, Huang Shaohong, and Chen Mingshu belong to this category of right-wing representatives. In order to consolidate the Party's leadership, in order to defend the socialist cause, and in order to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and the unity of the people of the whole country, we must thoroughly expose and resolutely struggle against these right-wing elements.

However, many people from the old society, due to the dominance of old ideas, always find it difficult to understand the serious political significance and the depth and sharpness of this class struggle, and therefore inevitably generate a certain degree of sentimentalism. We know that many of them are indeed sincerely loving the new China, loving the Communist Party, and loving socialism, and are supporting the unfolding of the struggle against the right-wing. However, they inevitably have conflicting emotions about the views on certain issues arising in the struggle. Why do such contradictions arise in their minds? This is because since liberation, although they have undergone eight years of ideological remolding, the improvement of their political awareness has been very slow, far behind the requirements of the progress of the times. Therefore, in the face of serious battles, they hesitate and look back, and their fighting spirit is not firm. From this, I deeply feel the necessity and arduousness of ideological remolding. If we do not firmly demand the will to transform ourselves, thoroughly criticize ourselves, and temper ourselves in actual struggle, it will not be easy to break old ideas and establish new ideas, and to stand firm, distinguish right from wrong in the revolutionary struggle.

Many of us from the old society, especially the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), have been influenced by old ideas to varying degrees. Today, we must deeply understand that the anti-rightist struggle is a serious class struggle, although this is a contradiction within the people, this is a severe test for us. We must accept this political test with a serious and earnest attitude. We must be frank and sincere, and do not hesitate to correct our mistakes; we must trust the Party, trust the government, and resolutely take the socialist road; we must also recognize that ideological remolding is not an easy task. Without profound self-education and practical struggle training, we cannot make the new self defeat the old self and play an active role in the socialist cause. I expect this from people from the old society, and I use this to encourage myself.

### 思想改造的必要性和艰巨性  李济深的发言

    思想改造的必要性和艰巨性
    李济深的发言
    我完全同意周总理关于政府工作的报告和其他几位负责同志的报告。
    我国自开国以来，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，已经取得了社会主义革命决定性的胜利，第一个五年计划将于今年完成和超额完成。在这短短期间内，改变了生产资料私有制，消灭了剥削，发展了生产力，提高了人民生活水平，提高了国际地位，全国人民长期以来所渴求实现的共同愿望，现在已经逐步实现。在这一事实面前，怎不令人欢欣鼓舞？
    我们知道，中国是一个六亿人口的大国，经济落后，文化落后，建设经验又十分缺乏，要在这样的基础上，把我国很快地建成为一个社会主义的工业国，是有一定的困难，同时，在工作过程中，也不免会发生一些错误和缺点。但是，只要全国人民团结一致，本着勤俭建国的精神，艰苦奋斗，积累经验，改进工作，发挥一切可以发挥的力量，我们完全相信，在工作中，将一定能够改正错误、缺点，克服困难，胜利前进。
    那些只看见小的缺点，不看见巨大成绩的人，真可说是“明察秋毫之末而不见舆薪”；至于那些有意地夸大缺点、抹煞成绩的人，则简直是不怀好意，别有用心的了。
    在社会主义改造与社会主义建设过程中，出现了那些反对社会主义、反对党的领导，夸大缺点，否定成绩的少数右派分子，并不是偶然的。因为自从农业手工业资本主义工商业社会主义改造基本完成，社会主义革命取得了决定性胜利后，过去仍然并存的五种经济，已经转变为单一的社会主义经济，这是一个巨大的物质基础的转变。大势所趋，人心所向，谁也阻止不了这一股时代进步的洪流。但是，经济的物质基础的转变，并不等于上层建筑之同时转变，也不等于说，人们的旧思想也随之马上转变过来了，思想的转变还须要一个过程。因此，在物质基础转变之后，就得进行加强思想改造，特别是旧知识分子的思想改造，以适应新形势的发展，这样，他们才不致于对新事物，在思想上发生抵触。
    在这一次巨大的社会主义变革中，曾经长期受到旧社会思想熏染的知识分子和出身于封建地主阶级、小资产阶级、资产阶级家庭的知识分子，在政治态度上有各种不同的表现。有一种人随着社会的进步在几年来的革命实践中，不断地提高了自己的思想觉悟，能够跟着时代前进，因而在社会主义改造和建设事业中，发挥了积极性，贡献了力量。另一种人在民主主义革命阶段中，虽然也起过一些作用，但是他们的思想没有随着社会的进步而进步，因而对新事物认识模糊，甚至有时发生抵触情绪。还有一种人，八年以来，旧思想，旧意识，根深蒂固原封不动，他们总是怀念过去，觉得旧的比新的好，对新社会没有一点感情。他们随时想把历史的车轮拉向后退，企图依照他们旧的资产阶级“图式”来建设他们的反动的“极乐世界”，再加上他们个人的恶劣品质和政治野心从中作祟，终于从对新社会的不满，发展到反党、反人民、反社会主义的道路。一九四八年，他们不是曾经发表声明拥护过召开新政协，拥护中国共产党的领导么？现在他们忘记这回事了。一九四九年，他们不是曾经参加过制订和举手赞成通过共同纲领么？现在他们也忘记这回事了。中华人民共和国成立以来，关于国家过渡时期总路线的讨论，关于中华人民共和国宪法的制订以及各项重大的政策方针的决定，他们不是曾经表示无保留的赞成和拥护么？现在他们也忘记这回事了。尤其是在中国共产党诞生三十周年纪念日各民主党派联合敬献的锦旗上，不是大家一致同意写着“永远跟着中国共产党走”的庄严语句么？现在他们也忘记这回事了。以上事实，在我则记忆犹新，而他们则对于过去所作过的庄严政治诺言，早已忘记得一干二净，假借帮助中国共产党整风之名，发表许多反党、反人民、反社会主义的荒谬言论，并进行一系列的阴谋活动，企图使资本主义在中国复辟。这是一种“人而无信”、“背信弃义”的行为。章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、龙云、黄绍竑、陈铭枢之流，便是属于这一类右派分子的代表人物。为了巩固党的领导，为了保卫社会主义事业，为了巩固无产阶级专政和全国人民的团结，我们必须向这些右派分子进行彻底的揭发和坚决的斗争。
    但是有不少来自旧社会的人，由于受着旧思想的支配，总不容易了解这一场阶级斗争的严肃的政治意义及其深刻性与尖锐性，因而难免有时产生一定程度的温情主义。我们知道，他们之中有不少人也确是真心热爱新中国，热爱共产党，热爱社会主义的，而且是拥护展开反击右派斗争的，但是他们对于在斗争中产生的某些问题的看法，总不免发生抵触情绪。为什么在他们思想中会发生这样的矛盾呢？这是由于他们自解放以来，虽然经过了八年的思想改造，而政治觉悟的提高，却非常缓慢，远远赶不上时代进步的要求，因而在严肃的战斗面前，徘徊却顾，斗志不坚。从这里使我深深感到思想改造的必要性和艰巨性，如果不坚定要求脱胎换骨的意志，痛下针砭并在实际斗争中陶铸锻炼，便不容易破旧思想立新思想，并在革命斗争中，站稳立场，分清是非。
    我们当中有不少来自旧社会的人，尤其是民革的同志，对旧思想都有不同程度的熏染。今天，我们要深刻认识反右派斗争是一场严肃的阶级斗争，虽然这是属于人民内部的矛盾，这是对我们的一个严重的考验。我们必须以严肃认真的态度来接受这一政治考验。我们必须坦白真诚，知过而勿惮改；我们必须信任党，信任政府，坚决走社会主义的道路；我们更须认识思想改造不是一件轻而易举的事，没有深刻的自我教育和实际斗争锻炼便不能使新我战胜旧我，在社会主义事业中，发挥积极作用。我以此期待于来自旧社会的人们，并以此策励我自己。
