    With You (and one other poem)
    Li Ying
    Ah! With you, the water flows murmuring, the mountain breathes there, open every window and look, the plump wheat ears whisper softly. Ah! With you, there is the sound of life, there are stories and poems, and everything is full of light, patterns, colors, and everything gets its own place. Ah! With you, I discover my life is infinitely vast, even though it is just a leaf; I discover my life has a thousand forms, even though the heart is only one, death only comes once. Ah! With you, the world is worthy of being the world!

    We Are Not Afraid
    Having passed through so many years of gloomy winds and rains, endured so many curses, whippings, and impacts, we are strong, we are the strongest, is there a higher right to pride in my life than this? Then, get out of here, rightists! Yesterday, you were polite, bowing while gnashing your teeth, today, you are riding in, hacking and slashing. Watch out! You will be crushed! We are not afraid, we are absolutely not afraid. Together with the sun, since our Party has been able to walk from yesterday, how could it not walk towards tomorrow?

    有了你（外一首）
    李瑛呵！有了你，水才潺潺地流动，山才在那儿呼吸，打开每一扇窗子看吧，肥硕的麦穗轻声低语。呵！有了你，才有了生命的声音，才有了故事和诗，并且一切才充满亮光、花纹、色彩，一切才得到他们自己的位置。呵！有了你，我发现我的生命无比巨大，虽然它不过是一片叶子；我发现我的生命有一千个，虽然心只有一颗，死只有一次。呵！有了你，世界才不愧为世界！
    我们是不怕的穿过多少风雨如晦的年月，忍受过多少诅咒、鞭打、冲击，但我们是坚强的，我们是最坚强的，难道在我的生活中还有比这更高的骄傲的权利？那么，滚开吧，右派分子！昨天，你彬彬有礼地一面鞠着躬一面又咬牙切齿，今天，你又骑马冲来，连砍带劈。留心！你将粉碎！我们是不怕的，我们是绝对不怕的。和太阳一起，我们的党既然能够从昨天走来，岂不能朝明天走去？
