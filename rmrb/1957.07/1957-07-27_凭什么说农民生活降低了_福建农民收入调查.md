What Justifies Saying Farmers' Lives Have Declined?
    ——An Investigation into Farmers' Income in Fujian
    Zhang Mingyang
    Some ulteriorly motivated right-wing ambitious elements, under the guise of helping the Party to rectify its work style, have issued arrogant anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist clamors, saying that the unified purchase and sale system has messed things up, farmers' incomes have decreased, and people's lives have declined. What is the truth? Many workers and farmers have already spoken out, refuting these right-wing elements' nonsense with vivid facts from their own experiences. I would now like to use what I saw in the rural areas of Fujian Province during my inspection in April and May this year to illustrate whether farmers' incomes have actually increased and whether their lives have improved.
    During my time in Fujian, in addition to contacting the Provincial Department of Agriculture, I also visited five agricultural production cooperatives: the Gushan Advanced Cooperative and the Yifeng Advanced Cooperative in Wufeng Township in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, the Democratic Second Advanced Cooperative in Luoshan Township in Jinjiang County, the Gongnong Advanced Cooperative in Fumei Township in Longxi County, and the Buwen Advanced Cooperative in Buwen Township. From what I heard and saw, the incomes of Fujian farmers increased significantly last year, and their lives are improving year by year.
    First, let me talk about the general situation. Like other provinces, Fujian Province basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture in 1955. By the end of the year, 91.94% of farm households in the province had joined agricultural cooperatives, of which 76.18% were in advanced cooperatives. On the basis of the basic realization of agricultural collectivization, a production upsurge was universally launched, and increased production was achieved. The achievements were enormous. Although last year suffered from severe natural disasters such as drought (affecting 4.8 million mu), typhoons, and floods, and the task of supporting the front was very heavy, the vast majority of crops achieved increased production. Taking grain output as an example, it increased by 1.146 billion jin compared with 1955, basically realizing the planned increase of 9 billion jin (including soybeans), an increase of 16% compared with 1955, with an average increase of 73 jin of grain per person in the province. This increase is more than double the total increase from 1953 to 1955.
    Last year, the total agricultural output value, calculated at constant prices, increased by about 10% compared with 1955. According to the materials provided by the Department of Agriculture, the growth of the average total output value per agricultural population per year in Fujian Province over the years (Note 1) is shown in the following table:
    Year    Average Total Output Value per Person per Year (Yuan)    Increase Compared to 1949 (Yuan)
    1949      50.60                        ——
    1950      58.78                        8.18
    1951      60.81                        10.21
    1952      66.89                        16.29
    1953      70.59                        19.99
    1954      68.80                        18.20
    1955      69.92                        19.32
    1956      76.73                        26.13
    Not only did the total output and total output value increase, but also many high-yield records appeared. Longxi and Haicheng counties are double-cropping rice counties, and Lianhua Township in Haicheng County created a record of 2,002 jin of rice per mu. More than 60 mu of sweet potato fields in the Pinghe Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangpu County yielded more than 10,000 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 15,000 jin. In addition, there are also high-yield records such as 10,000 jin of tangerines and 100 jin of tea.
    With the development of production, the income of the vast majority of farmers has increased compared to the past. More than 80% of agricultural cooperatives in the province saw increased income for more than 80% of their members. There are more than 17,700 agricultural cooperatives in Fujian Province (statistics at the end of 1956). According to a survey of 9,643 cooperatives, 5,645 cooperatives saw increased income for more than 90% of their members, accounting for 58.54%; 2,452 cooperatives saw increased income for 80%-90% of their members, accounting for 25.43%; only 1,546 cooperatives saw increased income for less than 80% of their members, accounting for 16.03%. Not only did the cooperative members with labor receive due remuneration from the distribution, but also the widowed, orphaned, and lonely had support for their lives and deaths due to the implementation of the "Five Guarantees" policy.
    The above is about the general situation. Now let's talk about the increased production and increased income of farmers in several agricultural cooperatives I saw.
    The Gushan Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs of Fuzhou, led by Zheng Yimu, a national model worker and representative of the National People's Congress, has seen its output increase year after year. Its production increase is as follows: 20% increase in 1952 compared with 1951; 15% increase in 1953 compared with 1952; 10% increase in 1954 compared with 1953; 12% increase in 1955 compared with 1954.
    The total output value of the Gushan Cooperative in 1955 was 309,22 yuan, and the total output value in 1956 increased to 453,755 yuan, an increase of more than 46%. The cooperative plans to increase its total output value to 600,000 yuan this year.
    Last year, 942 of the cooperative's 1,013 households increased their production, accounting for 93% of the members. Among the 90 households belonging to the second production team (including 59 poor peasant households, 24 middle peasant households, 2 rich peasant households, 2 commercial capitalist-cum-landlord households, and 3 landlord households), not a single household did not increase its income compared to the previous year. The amount of increase varied, with the smallest being 0.5% and the largest being 270%. Among them, 8 households increased by 30%, 7 households by 40%, 7 households by 50%, 11 households by 60%, 13 households by 70%, and 9 households by 100%.
    The Democratic Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luotang Village, Luoshan Township, Jinjiang County, increased its grain production by 15% in 1956 compared with 1955. The Gongnong Cooperative in Fumei Township, Dongyu District, Longxi County, saw increased income for all cooperative members except for 28 households that reduced production and 9 households whose income remained the same as the previous year. Among them, 48 households increased their income by less than 50 yuan, 47 households by 100 yuan, 153 households by 200 yuan, 130 households by 300 yuan, 54 households by 400 yuan, and 106 households by less than 500 yuan.
    There are currently no province-wide statistics on the average annual net income of Fujian farmers. However, in general, the average annual net income of each farmer in Fujian is relatively high and is increasing year by year. In August 1956, the Rural Work Department of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China organized a rural economic typical survey to investigate the changes in the rural economy and the increase or decrease in the actual income of farmers in 12 townships before and after the unified purchase and sale of grain and before and after agricultural collectivization (i.e., 1953, 1955, and 1956). These 12 townships can be roughly divided into three types:
    1.  Plain areas: Chenmen Township and Qingwei Township in Minhou, Liantang Township in Nan'an, and Zhengban Township in Putian;
    2.  Mountain areas: Chongrui Township and Xikou Township in Guangze, Gaobu Township in Nanping, and Shuiwei Township in Jianyang;
    3.  Urban and suburban areas in mountain areas: Dongfeng Town and Mafen Township in Jian'ou, Tongyou Town in Jianyang, and Jiangtun Township in Jianning.
    The economic structure of these townships is as follows: Zhengban Township in the plain area focuses on cash crops, and Chenmen Township focuses on both grain and horticultural crops; Xikou Township and Gaobu Township in the mountain area basically focus on both agriculture and forestry; the other 8 townships mainly focus on grain crops, followed by animal husbandry and household sideline occupations.
    The increase or decrease in the average annual actual income (total income minus production costs, taxes, public accumulation, and other expenses) of each farmer in these 12 townships (Note 2) is shown in the following table:
    Absolute Numbers           Fixed Base Index (1953 = 100)
    1953    1955    1956     1953  1955    1956
    77.99 yuan 72.21 yuan 81.09 yuan  100    92.59  103.97
    The increase or decrease in the average annual net income per person in these three types of regions is shown in the following table:
                   Average Net Income per Person
    Year    Region
    1953    Plain Area    75.95 yuan  67.11 yuan  76.73 yuan
    1955    Mountain Area    84.15 yuan  91.34 yuan  108.46 yuan
    1956　  Urban and Suburban Area  81.68 yuan  80.44 yuan  81.84 yuan
    Calculated as a percentage, the increase in the average annual net income per person in these three types of regions is as follows (1953 = 100):
    Year    Region
    1953    Plain Area  100  88.36  101.03
    1955    Mountain Area  100  108.54 128.89
    1956 Urban and Suburban Area  100  98.48  100.20
    This survey data shows that the average annual net income of Fujian farmers is relatively high compared to the national average, and it is increasing year by year (the decrease in production in 1955 was a special circumstance). According to the materials I learned from the rural areas this time, the average annual actual income of Fujian farmers is even higher. The average actual income per person in the four cooperatives, Gushan Cooperative, etc., in 1956 is shown in the following table:
  Cooperative Name          Gushan Cooperative  Yifeng Cooperative    Democratic Second Cooperative  Gongnong Cooperative
  Average Actual Income per Person  100 yuan    69 yuan (Note 3)101 yuan   150 yuan
    The above average net income figures are mostly estimated figures from each cooperative and are not completely accurate, but they are not far from the actual situation. Because I surveyed the highest and lowest income situations in these four cooperatives, the average obtained was not much different from the above actual income figures.
    For example, Chen Yihua, a poor peasant in the Gushan Cooperative, used to be a temple keeper. After liberation, he started a family of six. Last year, his total income from agriculture and sideline occupations was 800 yuan, with an average actual income of 133 yuan per person; Wang Jinlong, a middle peasant with a family of eight, had a total income of about 800 yuan last year, with an average of about 100 yuan per person. In Zheng Yisan's family in Yifeng Cooperative, there were ten people, and the annual income from agriculture and sideline occupations was about 1,500 yuan, which is 150 yuan per person. The Zhuang Qimou family had five people, with an agricultural income of 248 yuan, plus a sideline income of about 300 yuan, for a total of 548 yuan, with an average of more than 109 yuan per person. Ni Shide's family in the Democratic Second Cooperative had five people, and the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations was 700 yuan (the income of his brother supporting the front was not included). If averaged by four people, the actual income per person would be as high as 175 yuan; the family with the lowest income (name not recorded in detail) had an average of about 100 yuan per person. In Chen Muchi's family in the Gongnong Cooperative, there were nine people, and the annual actual income from agriculture was 1454.50 yuan, plus a sideline income of about 300 yuan, for a total income of about 1,754 yuan, with an average of more than 195 yuan per person; Chen Qingyuan's family had five people (one of whom went to join the army), and the total annual income was more than 514 yuan, with each person getting about 103 yuan. If the highest and lowest net income per year of middle peasants in these cooperatives are compared, there is the following table:
    Cooperative Name    Gushan Cooperative    Yifeng Cooperative    Democratic Second Cooperative    Gongnong Cooperative
    Net Income  133 yuan     150 yuan      175 yuan       195 yuan
            100 yuan     109 yuan      100 yuan       103 yuan  
    Item     
    Highest Net Income per Person  Lowest Net Income per Person
    From the figures obtained from the actual investigation in the above aspects, the net income of each farmer in Fujian in a year is obviously relatively high, because the national average net income from agricultural production per farmer per year is about 70 yuan. (See the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou)
    With the increase in income, the living standards of the vast majority of farmers have improved to a certain extent. Nowadays, it is rare to see people wearing patched clothes in the countryside. In the southern Fujian area, rural women are more likely to wear brightly colored floral fabrics. At present, the vast majority of farmers in rural Fujian have fundamentally shaken off the poverty of "bran and vegetables as food, fire cages as cotton-padded jackets." What they are singing today is: "Happy smiles with bountiful distribution, more than a few yuan for a day's work; sufficient food and ample money, prosperous family and celebrating the harvest year."
    Note 1: The total output value over the years only includes the indicators included in the plan (other crops such as green manure and vegetables are not included, but agricultural by-products such as rice straw and wheat straw are included), and other farm household sideline livestock products such as milk, chickens, ducks, and goose eggs are not included.
    Note 2: Production generally decreased in 1955.
    Note 3: Does not include sideline income. The cooperative plans to increase its net income to 96 yuan this year.

    凭什么说农民生活降低了
    ——福建农民收入调查
    张明养
    一些别有用心的右派野心分子借帮助党整风之名，发出反党、反人民、反社会主义的狂妄叫嚣，说什么统购统销搞糟了，农民收入减少了，人民生活降低了。事实到底怎样呢？许多工人、农民已经出来说话了，他们以亲身经历的活生生事实驳斥了这批右派分子的胡说。我现在想以今年4、5月间到福建省视察所看到的农村情况来说明农民的收入到底增加了没有，生活到底改善了没有。
    我这次在福建，除了同省农业厅接触外，还访问了五个农业生产合作社：福州市近郊的鼓山高级社和五凤乡益风高级社，晋江县的罗山乡民主第二高级社，龙溪县孚美乡工农高级社和步文乡步文高级社。就我所听到的和看到的来说，福建农民的收入在去年一年中都有很大的增加，生活也一年比一年改善了。
    先就总的情况来说一说。同其他省份一样，福建省在1955年已基本上完成农业的社会主义改造，到年底为止，全省加入农业合作社的农户占总农户的91.94％，其中高级社占总农户的76.18％。在基本实现农业合作化的基础上，普遍掀起了生产高潮，获得了增产，成绩是巨大的。去年虽然曾受旱灾（旱灾面积达480万亩）、台风、洪水等严重自然灾害，并且支前任务又十分繁重，但绝大多数的农作物都获得了增产。如以粮食产量来说，比1955年增产11.46亿斤，基本实现了90亿斤（包括大豆）的增产计划，比1955年增产16％，全省平均每人可增73斤粮食。这个增产数字，等于1953—1955年增产总数的二倍多。
    去年农业总产值，按不变价格计算，比1955年增长10％左右。据农业厅所提供的材料，福建省历年来每一农业人口每年平均总产值（注一）的增长情况如下表：
    年份    每人每年平均总产值（元）    比1949年增长情况（元）
    1949      50.60                        ——
    1950      58.78                        8.18
    1951      60.81                        10.21
    1952      66.89                        16.29
    1953      70.59                        19.99
    1954      68.80                        18.20
    1955      69.92                        19.32
    1956      76.73                        26.13
    不但总产量和总产值增加了，而且出现了不少的高额丰产纪录。龙溪和海澄县是双季稻千斤县，海澄县的莲花乡创造稻谷亩产2，002斤的纪录，漳浦县平和农业社60多亩番薯田每亩产量都达万斤以上，其中最高的达15，000千斤。此外还有万斤柑、百斤茶等高额丰产纪录。
    随着生产的发展，绝大多数农民的收入比过去增加了。全省有80％以上的农业社的80％以上的社员增加了收入。福建全省共有17，700多个农业社（1956年终统计），根据对9，643社的调查统计，做到90％以上社员增加收入的有5，645个社，占58.54％；做到80％—90％的社员增加收入的有2，452个社，占25.43％；社员增加收入在80％以下的只有1，546个社，占16.03％。不但有劳力的社员从分配中得到了应有的报酬，就是鳏、寡、孤、独，由于执行“五保”政策关系，生养老死也有了依靠。
    以上是就一般情况来说的。现在谈谈我所看到的几个农业合作社增产和农民收入增加的情况。
    福州东郊鼓山高级农业生产合作社，是全国劳模和全国人民代表大会代表郑依牳领导的一个合作社，该社历年的产量都是增加的，其增产情况：1952年比1951年增产20％；1953年比1952年增产15％；1954年比1953年增产10％；1955年比1954年增产12％。
    鼓山社1955年的总产值为309，22元，1956年的总产值增加到453，755元，增加46％以上。该社计划今年的总产值将增至60万元。
    去年该社1，013户社员中有942户是增产的，即占社员93％。在属于第二生产队的90户（包括贫农59户，中农24户，富农2户，商业资本家兼地主2户，地主3户）中，没有一户不比前年增加收入。增加收入之数不等，少者为0.5％，多者为270％。其中增加30％者有8户，40％者有7户，50％者有7户，60％者有11户，70％者有13户，100％有9户。
    晋江县罗山乡罗棠村民主第二农业生产合作社，1956年的粮食比1955年增产15％。龙溪县东屿区孚美乡工农合作社，1956年除了28户减产、9户收入与前年相平外，其余社员的收入都是增加的。其中收入增加在50元以下者计48户，100元者47户，200元者153户，300元者130户，400元者54户，500元以下者106户。
    关于福建农民的一年平均净收入情况，目前还没有全省性的统计数字。不过一般说来，福建每个农民一年平均净收入是比较高的，而且在逐年增长。1956年8月，中共福建省委农村工作部曾组织一次农村经济典型调查，调查12个乡在粮食统购统销前后和农业合作化前后（亦即1953、1955、1956年）农村经济变化和农民实际收入增减情况。这12个乡大体可划分为3个类型：
    一、平原区：有闽侯城门乡、青围乡，南安莲塘乡，莆田郑坂乡；
    二、山区：有光泽崇瑞乡、西口乡，南平高埠乡，建阳水尾乡；
    三、山区的城镇郊区：有建瓯东峰镇、马坟乡，建阳童游镇，建宁将屯乡。
    这些乡的经济结构概况是：平原区的郑坂乡是以经济作物为主，城门乡是以粮食和园艺作物并重；山区的西口乡和高埠乡基本上农林并重；其他8个乡均以粮食作物为主，动物饲养业和家庭副业次之。
    这12个乡的每个农民一年平均实际收入（总收入除去生产费用、税收，公共积累及其他开支）的增减（注二）情况如下表：
    绝　对　数           定基指数（以1953年为100）
    1953    1955    1956     1953  1955    1956
    77.99元 72.21元 81.09元  100    92.59  103.97
    至于这三类地区每人一年平均净收入的增减情况如下表：
                   每人平均净收入
    年度    地区
    1953    平原区    75.95元  67.11元  76.73元
    1955    元山区    84.15元  91.34元  108.46元
    1956　  城镇郊区  81.68元  80.44元  81.84元
    如以百分比计算，这三类地区每人一年平均净收入的增产情形如下（以1953年为100）
    年度    地区
    1953    平原区  100  88.36  101.03
    1955    山　区  100  108.54 128.89
    1956城　镇郊区  100  98.48  100.20
    这个调查数字说明福建农民一年平均净收入在全国说起来是比较高的，而且年有增加（1955年减产系特殊情况）。根据我这次在农村了解所得材料，福建农民一年平均实收入是更高一些的。1956年鼓山社等四个社内每人平均实收入如下表：
  社　名          鼓山社  益风社    民主二社  工农社
  每人平均实收入  100元    69元（注三）101元   150元
    上面这些平均净收入数字，多为各该社估计数字，不完全正确，但与实际情况相差不远。因为我曾在这四个社中，调查一年最高收入和最低收入情况，所得平均数与上述实收入数字相差不多。
    例如鼓山社贫农陈依华过去为一看庙的人，解放后成家，共六人，去年农副业总收入800元，每人平均实收入133元；中农王金龙一家八人，去年总收入约800元；每人平均约100元。益风社郑彦三家，共十人，全年农副业收入约1，500元，每人为150元，庄其谋家五口人，农业收入248元，加上副业收入约300元，共计548元，每人平均为109元余。民主二社的倪世德一家五人，农副业收入共700元，（其兄支前收入未计在内）如以四人平均，则每人实收入达175元之多；收入最低一家（姓名未详记）每人平均约为100元。工农社的陈木池家，共九人，每年农业实收入1454.50元，加上副业收入约300元，共约收入1，754元，每人平均约195元余；陈清源家共五人（内一人去参军），年收入共514元余，每人约得103元。如将这几个社中农每年最高净收入和最低净收入相比，有如下表：
    社名    鼓山社    益风社    民主二社    工农社
    净收入  133元     150元      175元       195元
            100元     109元      100元       103元  
    项目     
    每人最高净收入  每人最低净收入
    就以上各方面实际调查所得的数字来看，福建每个农民一年的净收入，显然是比较高的，因为全国平均起来，每个农民一年的农业生产净收入，大约在70元左右。（见周总理所作政府工作报告）
    随着收入的增加，广大农民的生活水平都有了一定程度的提高。现在在农村中穿补丁衣服的已不多见，在闽南一带地区，农村妇女更多穿着颜色鲜艳的花布衣服。目前福建农村中的绝大多数农民已根本摆脱了“糠菜当粮草、火笼当棉袄”的贫困状态，他们今天所歌颂的是：“丰收分配笑连连，劳动一天块多钱；粮食充足钱宽用，财丁兴旺庆丰年”。
    注一、历年总产值仅包括列入计划的指标（其中绿肥、蔬菜等其他作物不包括在内，但农作物副产品如稻秆、麦秸等包括在内），其他农家副业畜产品如牛乳、鸡、鸭、鹅蛋等不包括在内。
    注二、1955年一般都是减产的。
    注三、不包括副业收入，该社今年计划净收入增至96元。
