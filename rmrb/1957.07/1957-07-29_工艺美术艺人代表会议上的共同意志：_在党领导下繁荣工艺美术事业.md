Strive to improve skills, strengthen creation and design, and improve patterns and varieties; 3. Do not be arrogant or complacent, learn with an open mind, and strengthen unity; 4. Conscientiously implement the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily" and "running enterprises diligently and thriftily," strive to do a good job in production, and consolidate socialist ownership; 5. Strengthen political study, improve ideological awareness, and actively participate in the anti-rightist struggle.

    During this meeting, the representatives also widely exchanged experiences through work observation, group discussions, and mutual visits.
