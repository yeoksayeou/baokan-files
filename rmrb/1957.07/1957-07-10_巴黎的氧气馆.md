    Oxygen Bars in Paris
    Currently, in Paris, a type of shop called "oxygen bar" is emerging. Customers don't come here to drink or order food, but to "feast" on fresh air. Technicians ask customers to take off their shoes, sit in leather chairs, and put on a transparent mask to breathe pure oxygen for several minutes, leaving them feeling refreshed and invigorated.

    巴黎的氧气馆
    目前在巴黎市内，一种叫做“氧气馆”的铺子应时兴起。顾客们到这里不是喝酒点菜，而是来“饱餐”新鲜空气。技术员让顾客脱下皮鞋，坐上皮椅，再给带上一只透明的面罩，呼吸上数分钟纯粹的氧气，使人精神爽然而出。
