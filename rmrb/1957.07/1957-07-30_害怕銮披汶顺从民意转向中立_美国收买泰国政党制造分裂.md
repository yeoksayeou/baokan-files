Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 28th: The Thai "Political Weekly" revealed on the 21st that the United States is spending a huge sum of 40 million baht to buy political parties in Thailand.

The report said that in order to conceal this fact, the United States remitted the money to a bank in Taipei, and then the bank transferred it to Bangkok for a leader of the Thai "Transformation Party" to receive.

"New Thai News" confirmed the above news, saying that the purpose of a certain Western power in doing so was to overthrow the current government. Because it feared that the Phibunsongkhram government would adopt a neutral policy in accordance with the requirements of the Thai people.

The "Political Weekly" also quoted an unnamed source close to the government as saying that another serious act of interference by the United States was to create divisions between Defense Minister Sarit Thanarat and Interior Minister Pao Sriyanond. In order to create tension in Thailand and create suspicion of the police among Thai soldiers, the United States shipped a large amount of arms to the Thai Police Department.

According to newspaper reports, Thai Prime Minister’s Secretary Phao Phenjati stated to the press that the United States is engaged in a wide variety of political activities in Thailand. The United States is openly supporting the current Thai government, but secretly supporting the opposition. This Justice Party leader, who has a close relationship with Phibunsongkhram, called on all Thai political parties to reject US support in order to avoid and eliminate potentially serious domestic political chaos.

    害怕銮披汶顺从民意转向中立
    美国收买泰国政党制造分裂
    据新华社28日讯　曼谷消息：泰国“政治周刊”21日透露，美国以四千万铢的巨额款项，在泰国进行收买政党的活动。
    消息说，为了掩饰这个事实，美国把这笔款项汇往台北一家银行，再由这家银行转往曼谷给泰国“变政团”的一个领导人物收下。
      “新泰报”证实了上述消息，它说，某西方大国这样做的目的，是为了推翻现政府。因为它害怕銮披汶政府会按照泰国人民的要求，采取中立政策。
      “政治周刊”还援引一位不愿透露姓名的接近官方人士透露的消息说，美国的另一项严重的干涉活动，就是在国防部长乃沙立和内政部长乃炮之间制造分裂。为了在泰国制造紧张局势和在泰国军人中制造对警察的猜疑，美国运了大批军火供给泰国警察厅。
    另据报纸报道，泰国总理秘书乃扁·文耶触向报界指出，美国在泰国所从事的政治活动，花样很多。美国公开是支持泰国现政府，但暗地里却在支持反对派。这位和銮披汶有密切关系的正义党领袖呼吁，为了避免和消除可能产生的严重的国内政局的混乱，泰国各个政党应当拒绝美国的支持。
