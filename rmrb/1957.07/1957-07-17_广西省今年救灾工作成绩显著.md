Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: Guangxi Province has learned from the lessons of deaths caused by disasters last year, and its disaster relief work this year has improved.

    First, the organizational leadership of disaster relief work has been strengthened. Disaster relief committees and offices have been established at all levels in the province, special districts, counties, and townships, and a series of effective measures have been taken. The Guangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee issued "Emergency Instructions on the Current Disaster Relief Work," and convened a meeting of prefectural party committee secretaries on June 10 to specifically deploy summer production disaster relief work. The meeting determined that the current rural work should focus on production for disaster relief, emphasizing comprehensive arrangements, all-out efforts, in-depth inspections, and doing a good job in grain unified sales, relief, disease medical treatment, and other tasks, and closely integrating them with production, caring about the people's suffering ideologically, and using all methods to ensure that no one starves to death again.

    In order to grasp the disaster situation in a timely manner, the Guangxi Provincial Production Disaster Relief Committee issued "Regulations on Investigating and Reporting Disasters During the Summer Famine Period" on June 10, requiring the production disaster relief offices of each special district and county to establish a regular reporting system to the provincial disaster relief office, and townships and districts to establish corresponding regular reporting systems to the county, and the county to the special district.

    The method of "overall planning, household-by-household arrangement, fixed work production, and fixed quota assistance" is also implemented throughout the province, so that the masses in disaster areas have unified arrangements from production to life, from money to grain. More than 5 million yuan of relief funds and more than 12 million yuan of agricultural loans have been issued to the disaster areas throughout the province. In order to ensure that the masses in disaster areas have money to buy grain, the provincial civil affairs, finance, and grain departments jointly issued a notice to distribute a portion of the relief funds in the form of grain. In order to solve the problem of over-consumption of grain, grain replenishment work has been carried out in various places. Guangxi Province plans to transfer 22.5 million jin of grain from Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and within the province to the disaster areas in June. At present, more than 1,230 trucks and other transportation tools supported by Guangxi Province and Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are rushing to the disaster areas.

    The Guangxi Provincial Health Department has also increased medical funds to various places by 20,500 yuan. More than 600,000 sulfonamide drugs have been issued, and 58 medical personnel have been transferred to work in severely affected areas to prevent the epidemic of diseases in disaster areas and rescue patients.

    广西省今年救灾工作成绩显著
    据新华社16日讯　广西省接受了去年因灾死人的教训，今年的救灾工作已经有了改进。
    首先是加强了救灾工作的组织领导。省、专、县、乡各级都先后建立了救灾委员会和办公室，采取了一系列的有效措施。广西省委、省人民委员会发出了“关于目前救灾工作的紧急指示”，并于6月10日召开地委书记会议，专门布署了夏季生产救灾工作。会议确定当前农村工作以生产救灾为中心，强调全面安排，全力以赴，深入检查和作好粮食统销、救济、疾病医疗等工作，并使之同生产紧密结合，从思想上关心人民疾苦，用一切办法保证不再饿死一个人。
    为了及时掌握灾情，广西省生产救灾委员会在6月10日发出了“关于夏荒期间查灾报灾的规定”指示，要求各专、县生产救灾办公室向省救灾办公室建立经常的定期汇报制度，乡、区向县，县向专区建立相应的定期汇报制度。
    在全省范围内还实行“全面规划、逐户安排、定工生产、定额辅助”的办法，使灾区群众从生产到生活，从钱到粮都有了统一的安排。全省已经发到灾区的救济款有五百多万元，农贷款一千二百多万元。为了保证灾区群众有钱能买到粮食，省民政、财政、粮食三厅共同发出通知，将一部分救济款折粮发放。为了解决吃过头粮问题，各地进行了粮食补销工作。广西省6月份计划从云南、贵州两省和省内调运粮食二千二百五十万斤到灾区。目前广西省和云贵两省支援的汽车一千二百三十多辆及其他运输工具正向灾区赶运。
    广西省卫生厅并已增拨各地医疗款二万零五百元。发出磺胺类药品六十多万片，抽调医务人员五十八人分赴重灾区工作，防止灾区疫病流行和抢救病人。
