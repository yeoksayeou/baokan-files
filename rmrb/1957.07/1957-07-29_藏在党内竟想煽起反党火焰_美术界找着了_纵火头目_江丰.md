Hiding Within the Party, Attempting to Ignite Anti-Party Flames
Art Circles Find the "Arsonist"—Jiang Feng

(Our Dispatch) Artists in the capital held a symposium yesterday at the Ministry of Culture, exposing and criticizing Jiang Feng's (President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Vice Chairman and Party Group Secretary of the Chinese Artists Association) anti-Party speeches and actions.

Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, briefly described Jiang Feng's anti-Party words and deeds at the meeting. He hoped that the art circles would launch a political debate and, in accordance with Chairman Mao's six criteria, distinguish between right and wrong.

According to the materials initially revealed at the meeting, Jiang Feng has consistently violated the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." Under the guise that traditional Chinese painting is "unscientific," "cannot reflect modern life," and "cannot serve politics," he belittled traditional Chinese painting and failed to unite traditional Chinese painters. This has seriously affected the Party's policy of inheriting and developing national traditions and the united front policy. Feng Xiangyi, an assistant teacher at the Academy of Fine Arts, revealed that Jiang Feng once said: "Letting a hundred flowers bloom may be feasible in society, but it is not feasible within our school. Our school only allows one flower to bloom, and that is socialist realism."

Behind the Scenes, He Instigated the Pang Xunqin Rightist Clique to Propose a Reactionary Program, Gathering Artists Inside and Outside the Party to Wage a "Final Battle" Against the Party

Last April, at a symposium held by the Party Group of the Ministry of Culture, the Party seriously criticized Jiang Feng's error of violating the Party's policy. However, instead of correcting his mistakes, Jiang Feng spread rumors within and outside the Party, falsely claiming that some leading comrades of the Ministry of Culture and the Artists Association had formed factions to frame and attack him, and falsely claiming that the Ministry of Culture was excluding oil painting, thereby inciting the art circles to oppose the leadership of the Party.

Lei Guiyuan, Vice President of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, said: Jiang Feng played a major role in the recent exposure of the Pang Xunqin rightist clique's frenzied attacks on the Party. Jiang Feng admitted in a letter to the Beijing Municipal Committee on July 4 that Pang Xunqin had visited Jiang Feng before drafting the anti-Party program (the so-called "Ten Suggestions" and "Regulations for Democratic School Management"), and the three opinions Jiang Feng put forward to him regarding the administrative organization of the academy constituted the central content of Pang Xunqin's anti-Party program. In fact, Jiang Feng had long opposed the Party's leadership over the school. He once said: "I do not agree with the school implementing a Party committee system. I have not implemented a Party committee system."

Li Geng, Wang Qi, Ai Zhongxin, and others revealed in their speeches that in May, the Party Group of the Ministry of Culture and the Party Group of the Artists Association jointly held several symposiums, inviting people in the art circles to offer their opinions. Jiang Feng carried out organization and instigation behind the scenes, opposing the leadership of the Party. After the second symposium convened by the Ministry of Culture, Jiang Feng gathered eleven artists inside and outside the Party, giving them instructions and assigning them tasks. Jiang Feng instructed: "This is the final battle," "the target should be concentrated," and "talk less about academic issues and more about factional activities." Jiang Feng and others also carried out instigation in units such as the oil painting training class and the sculpture factory. Wang Qi revealed that Li Zongjin (professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts) also suggested to Jiang Feng that he and Wu Zuoren jointly invite Xu Beihong's widow, Liao Jingwen, to speak at the Ministry of Culture. As a result, a large number of uninvited people suddenly appeared at the third symposium held on May 25. Some people even brought paintings and sculptures to participate, shouting and applauding at the meeting, forming a demonstration with strong hostility. The speeches of Mo Pu, Wang Manshuo, Li Zongjin, and others distorted the facts and openly attacked the Party. Some people falsely accused some comrades of the Party Group of the Ministry of Culture and the Party Group of the Artists Association of forming a factional group to "frame" Jiang Feng, attack oil painting, and split the unity of the art circles; some people falsely accused the Ministry of Culture of suppressing the Xu Beihong school of painting; some people attacked the People's Daily for factionalism. After the meeting, Jiang Feng and others expressed dissatisfaction with the news published in the People's Daily, believing that it "cannot reflect the excited emotions of the masses that day," and planned to hold a press conference for the Guangming Daily and the Wenhui Daily. They said, "If the People's Daily does not publish it, the Wenhui Daily must publish it." They compiled 60,000 words of records and planned to submit them to the Wenhui Daily for publication; in addition, they printed more than 100 copies, intending to distribute them to art colleges and artists associations across the country, igniting anti-Party flames in the art circles across the country.

Openly Opposing the Party's "Eighth National Congress" Resolutions and the Policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"

According to the revelations at the meeting, Jiang Feng harbored dissatisfaction with the Party for a long time and often scolded Party organizations within and outside the Party, spreading remarks that were unfavorable to the Party, unfavorable to socialism, and unfavorable to international unity. Jiang Feng was dissatisfied with our Party's life. He said: "There is a lot of darkness within the Party," "Many things are wrong within the Party," "My problems cannot be solved within the Party, they must be solved by the masses." He believed that "there is no democracy within the Party now, everything is predetermined." Jiang Feng believed that "there is nothing to learn from the documents of the Eighth National Congress." Jiang Feng opposed Party members listening to the Party and the Party's leading comrades. He expressed dissatisfaction with Zhou Yang, Qian Junrui, and other comrades quoting the words of Party leaders in their speeches. He said that the words of Party leaders "are not entirely correct in every sentence," and he attempted to use this to oppose Party leaders, saying that "it is very dangerous to decide problems based on one or two sentences from above, this is a kind of worship of authority." Jiang Feng once said: "What achievements have been made in the anti-Party purge movement? Many people say that the achievements of the anti-Party purge are the main thing, and deviations in mass movements are inevitable, this theory is very terrible." He also said: "What special agents have been purged in the literary and art circles?" Jiang Feng also sympathized with and co-opted people who had been investigated by the Party during the anti-Party purge movement, and opposed the comrades who led the anti-Party purge.

Most rampantly, in his speech at the Shanghai group of the National People's Congress, Jiang Feng openly opposed the resolutions of the Party's Eighth National Congress. He believed that the dogmatism and "leftist" opportunism that had emerged inside and outside the Party were due to the Eighth National Congress resolutions and the Party's proposal of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Jiang Feng also repeatedly made remarks unfavorable to Sino-Soviet unity at the Shanghai group meeting of the National People's Congress and on other occasions.

Liang Sicheng made a written statement at the meeting. He said: Jiang Feng's every word and deed completely violates the six criteria instructed by Chairman Mao. Jiang Feng, as today's People's Daily editorial said, is a rightist element within the Party.

An Old Communist Party Member, Yet Persistently Adhering to Individualistic Errors, Finally Embarking on an Anti-Party Road

Jiang Feng's anti-Party actions have even developed to the point of directly resisting the Party Central Committee. It was revealed at the meeting that because Jiang Feng had long violated the Party's literary and art policies, he did not convey some important instructions of central leading comrades regarding art work to the art circles, deliberately obstructing the implementation of the Party's policies in the art circles. In April of this year, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee inspected the work of the East China Branch of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and discovered that Jiang Feng, Mo Pu, and others had seriously violated the Party's literary and art policies. After this, the comrade in charge of the Party Central Committee instructed Jiang Feng to go to Hangzhou to accept the Party's investigation. However, Jiang Feng repeatedly delayed going. The comrades in charge of the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Culture repeatedly urged him, but Jiang Feng simply ignored them. He believed that the Party Central Committee "listened to only one side." When the rightist elements launched a frenzied attack on the Party, Jiang Feng became even more arrogant. He openly said: "Why should I go to Hangzhou now? I want to settle the score here!" Jiang Feng is an old Communist Party member. In the long life of revolutionary struggle, he was unwilling to strictly transform himself, persisted in and developed his bourgeois individualism, and finally embarked on a dead end of opposing the Party and opposing socialism.

Wu Zuoren, Wang Shikuo, Liu Kaiqu, and others also spoke at the symposium. More than 120 oil painters, traditional Chinese painters, printmakers, and art theorists from the capital attended yesterday's symposium. The symposium to expose and criticize Jiang Feng's anti-Party words and deeds will continue to be held.

### 藏在党内竟想煽起反党火焰  美术界找着了“纵火头目”——江丰

    藏在党内竟想煽起反党火焰
    美术界找着了“纵火头目”——江丰
    本报讯　首都的美术家们昨天在文化部召开的座谈会上，揭露、批判了江丰（中央美术学院院长、中国美术家协会副主席、党组书记）的反党言论和行动。
    文化部副部长钱俊瑞在会上简述了江丰的反党言行。他希望美术界展开一场政治大辩论，按照毛主席指示的六项标准，辨明大是大非。
    根据会上初步揭露的材料，江丰一贯违反党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针。在国画“不科学”，“不能反映现代生活”、“不能为政治服务”的借口下，轻视国画，不注意团结国画家。使党的继承和发扬民族传统的政策和统一战线政策受到严重影响。美术学院助教冯湘一揭露说，江丰曾经说过：“百花齐放在社会上可行，在我们学校内不行。我们校内只容许开一朵花，就是社会主义现实主义。”
    幕后指使庞熏琴右派集团提出反动纲领纠集党内外美术家向党进行“最后战斗”
    去年4月，在文化部党组召开的座谈会上，党严肃地批评了江丰的这种违反党的政策的错误。但是江丰非但不改正错误，反而在党内党外散播流言蜚语，诬称文化部和美协的一部分领导同志结成宗派，陷害和打击他，诬称文化部排斥油画，借此煽动美术界反对党的领导。
    中央工艺美术学院副院长雷圭元说：最近揭露的庞熏琴右派集团向党猖狂进攻的活动，江丰在这方面起了主要的作用。江丰在7月4日写给北京市委的信中也已承认，庞熏琴在起草反党纲领（所谓“十点建议”和“民主治校”简则）以前，曾访问江丰，江丰向他提出的关于学院行政组织的三点意见，构成了庞熏琴反党纲领的中心内容。事实上，江丰很早以前就反对党对学校的领导。他曾说：“我是不同意学校搞党委制的，我就没有搞党委制”。
    李赓、王琦、艾中信等在发言中揭露说，5月间文化部党组和美协党组联合召开了多次座谈会，邀请美艺界人士提意见。江丰在幕后进行组织和煽动，反对党的领导。文化部召集的第二次座谈会后，江丰曾召集党内外美术家十一人集会，面授机宜，布置任务。江丰指示：“这是最后的战斗”，“目标要集中”，“少谈学术问题，多谈宗派活动”。江丰等人并且在油画训练班和塑雕工厂等单位进行煽动。王琦揭发，李宗津（中央美术学院教授）还向江丰出主意，建议他和吴作人一起去邀请徐悲鸿夫人廖静文到文化部去发言。这样，在5月25日举行的第三次座谈会上，突然出现了大批未经邀请的人。有些人还带了绘画和雕塑作品去参加，在会上呐喊鼓掌，形成了一种带有强烈敌意的示威行动。莫扑、王曼硕、李宗津等人的发言，更是歪曲事实，露骨地向党进攻。有人诬蔑文化部党组和美协党组一部分同志结成宗派集团，“陷害”江丰，打击油画，分裂美术界团结；有人诬蔑文化部打击徐悲鸿画派；有人攻击人民日报有宗派主义。会后，江丰等人对于人民日报刊载的新闻还表示不满，认为“不能反映那天群众激奋的情绪”，准备举行光明日报和文汇报两报记者招待会。他们说，“人民日报不登就要文汇报登。”他们整理了六万字的记录，要交给文汇报发表；另外还印了一百多份，打算发给全国各地美术院校和美协，在全国各地美术界点燃起反党的火焰。
    公然反对党的“八大”决议和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针
    根据会上的揭发，长时期内，江丰对党怀有不满情绪，而且经常在党内党外辱骂党的组织，散布不利于党、不利于社会主义、不利于国际团结的言论。江丰不满意我们党的生活。他说：“党内黑暗很多”“党内许多东西搞错了”“我的问题党内不能解决，要由群众来解决”。他认为“现在党内不民主，什么都是圈定”。江丰认为，“八大文件没有什么可学的”。江丰反对党员听党和党的领导同志的话。他对于周扬、钱俊瑞等同志在讲话中引用党的领袖的话，表示不满。他说党的领袖的话“并不是每一句都是完全正确”，他企图以此来反对党的领袖，说什么“根据上面一两句话来决定问题是很危险的，这是一种崇拜权威的思想”。江丰曾说：“肃反运动有什么成绩？许多人都说肃反成绩是主要的，在群众运动中有偏差是不可避免的，这种理论非常可怕。”还说：“文艺界又肃出了什么特务？”江丰还同情和拉拢在肃反运动中受党审查过的人，反对领导肃反的同志。
    最为猖狂的是，在全国人民代表大会上海小组的发言中，江丰公然反对党的八大决议。他认为党内党外出现的教条主义和“左”倾机会主义，是因为八大决议和党提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的缘故。江丰还在人代会上海小组会上及其他场合，一再发表不利于中苏团结的言论。
    梁思成在会上作了书面发言。他说：江丰的一切言行，是与毛主席指示的六项标准完全违背的。江丰正如今天人民日报社论所说的，是党内的右派分子。
    一个老共产党员，却长期坚持个人主义错误，终于走上反党道路
    江丰的反党行动甚至已经发展到了直接抗拒党中央的地步。会上揭露，由于江丰长期违反党的文艺方针，他对中央领导同志关于美术工作的若干重要指示，也不向美术界传达，故意阻挠党的政策在美术界贯彻。今年4月，浙江省委检查了中央美术学院华东分院的工作，发现了江丰、莫扑等严重违反党的文艺政策的错误以后，党中央负责同志曾经指示江丰去杭州接受党的审查。江丰却一再拖延不去。中央宣传部和文化部负责同志再三催促，江丰根本置之不理。他认为党中央“偏听偏信”。在右派分子发动向党猖狂进攻的时候，江丰更加飞扬跋扈了，他公然说：“现在我为什么还要到杭州去，我要在这里把账算清楚！”江丰是一个老共产党员，在长期的革命斗争生活中，不愿严格改造自己，坚持和发展了他的资产阶级个人主义，终于走上了反党反社会主义的绝路。
    在座谈会上讲话的，还有吴作人、王式廓、刘开渠等。出席昨天的座谈会的，有首都的油画家、国画家、版画家、美术理论家等一百二十多人。揭露和批判江丰反党言行的座谈会还要继续举行。
