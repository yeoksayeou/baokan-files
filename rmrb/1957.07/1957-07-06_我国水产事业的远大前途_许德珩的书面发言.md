Please allow me to report on the main situation of China's aquatic industry and put forward suggestions for future aquatic work, requesting criticism and correction:

    Rich Aquatic Resources, Superior Production Conditions

China's aquatic resources are abundant. From the ocean's perspective, it faces the sea on the southeast, with a coastline of more than 11,000 kilometers. In this vast ocean, the cold currents of the north and the warm currents of the south converge, and inland rivers carry a large amount of organic matter, providing abundant bait, which is suitable for the large-scale habitation and reproduction of various fish and other aquatic plants and animals. Along the coast and in the adjacent high seas, in the sea area within a water depth of 200 meters suitable for fishery production, there are 436,000 square nautical miles. From the perspective of inland areas, China's rivers and lakes are crisscrossed, and ponds and swamps are dotted everywhere, with a water surface of about 160 million mu available for fishing and aquaculture. In addition, there are an increasing number of mountain ponds and reservoirs that can be used for fish farming, and there are also many paddy fields in the south that can be used for fish farming. Freshwater fish farming not only does not occupy farmland, but also has low costs, high benefits, and quick results. It has become a profession and sideline for fishermen and farmers. The fish farming industry has a long history and rich experience in China. "Fish" has always been compared with "rice and salt," which are most necessary for the people, and are collectively called "the source of national wealth." In short, whether from the ocean or freshwater, China's aquatic products have their superior production conditions. This is one of the unlimited treasures that China's socialist construction can utilize, and at the same time, it can be seen that China's aquatic industry has a bright future.

Aquatic products are an important non-staple food in people's lives. Its nutritional value is high. Although Mencius chose bear paws in the case of "cannot have both," "fish" was a food he "desired." The Chinese people express their beautiful life as "eating fish and meat," and call prosperous areas "the land of fish and rice," which also shows the position of fish in people's lives. At present, developing aquatic products can not only meet the growing needs of the people for non-staple foods and ease the tension in meat supply, but also have extensive uses in industry, agriculture, and medicine. In recent years, China's aquatic products have been exported to foreign countries and are widely welcomed in the international market and in short supply. Exporting one ton of prawns can exchange for six tons of steel, and one ton of dried shrimp can exchange for nine and a half tons of steel. Therefore, developing aquatic products, increasing the supply of non-staple foods for the people, expanding exports, earning foreign exchange, and supporting national construction are of great significance.

The aquatic industry is a mass production industry with low investment and high labor capacity. Developing aquatic products can expand the number of people employed and solve the living problems of a large part of the people. As the saying goes, "Three mountains, six waters, and one point of farmland" and "Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water," China has little land and a large population, and land reclamation is not easy. Going up the mountains and down to the water are both necessary ways out. From the perspective of solving the people's employment problem, the significance of "eating water" is even greater. At present, China's fishing population is about 4.57 million, plus other employed population of about 6 million. According to preliminary calculations, if the output of aquatic products can be increased to 4.3 million tons in the Second Five-Year Plan, it can solve the living problems of nearly 10 million people. Therefore, it is a major issue worthy of our attention today to solve the labor employment problem by developing the aquatic industry.

Among the 4.57 million fishermen, coastal fishermen account for more than half. These working people, who have lived in the long coastline for generations and engaged in production, not only have to fight against nature in the turbulent waves at all times, but also have to fight against the imperialist pirates who are eyeing them covetously to defend the motherland. Therefore, developing the aquatic industry and improving and stabilizing the lives of coastal fishermen are important strategies for consolidating national defense. Now, on the opposite side of China's northeast coast, there is the Li Chengran (Syngman Rhee) group, and in the south, there is the Ngo Dinh Diem group. Moreover, China's territory of Taiwan is still under the control of the US imperialism. These vicious enemies are looting and harassing in China's coastal areas, and the struggle is very sharp. Chinese fishermen and state-owned motorized fishing industry workers adhere to production in such a complex and sharp struggle situation, and cooperate with the heroic navy to guard the motherland's sea defense, becoming a sharp soldier guarding the coast. Therefore, developing the aquatic industry and doing a good job in fishermen's work are of extremely great significance to China's sea defense.

    Shortcomings and Problems in Development

Since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the efforts of aquatic staff at all levels, and the increase in the enthusiasm of the broad masses of fishermen, the cooperation of fishery has been basically realized, state-owned production enterprises have had a preliminary foundation, and aquatic supply and marketing enterprises have been generally established, so that China's aquatic industry has had greater development. Before liberation, the highest annual output in history was in 1936, when the output was 1.5 million tons. After the successive destruction by the Japanese, puppet, and Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regimes, the output in 1949 dropped to 450,000 tons. After liberation, by 1952, when the period of economic recovery was completed, the national aquatic output had reached 1.66 million tons, exceeding the highest historical record by 11 percent. After that, it developed year by year, and by last year, the total output had reached 2.64 million tons, an increase of more than 59 percent over 1952, ranking third in the world. We should affirm these achievements since liberation.

However, it must be admitted that China's aquatic industry still has many shortcomings and problems today:

First of all, comparing China's current aquatic output with aquatic resources, and comparing aquatic output with the needs of people's lives, they are very inconsistent. As mentioned earlier, China's coastal fishing grounds have an area of 436,000 square nautical miles, and there are many water surfaces available for aquaculture and fishing in inland areas. However, China's total output of marine and freshwater accounts for only about one-tenth of the world's total output. Furthermore, comparing it by population, if calculated by China's population and aquatic output last year, each person has only 8.5 jin per year, while the Soviet Union has an average of 27 jin per person, Britain and the United States both have about 30 jin, and Japan even reaches 105 jin. According to China's planned development speed, when the output increases to 4.3 million tons in the Second Five-Year Plan, the average per person will only be 13 jin, which is far behind the above-mentioned countries.

Secondly, the main producers of China's aquatic industry are 1.5 million laborers among the 4.57 million fishermen, and their main production tools are 440,000 non-powered wooden sailboats. They rely on these ships for production. There are currently only 400 state-owned fishing vessels, with 27,000 tons, plus more than 700 motorized sailboats of fishermen. These motorized fishing boats total only more than 1,100, with a deadweight of only more than 40,000 tons, accounting for 3.6 percent of the total deadweight of China's fishing boats, and only 4 percent of the tonnage of Japan's power fishing boats.

China's aquatic science is backward. At present, there are only 11 aquatic scientific research institutions in the country, and most of them have weak foundations. Japan has 60 such scientific research institutions, and the Soviet Union also has 29. China has only one aquatic college, and only one university has an aquatic department. There are only four secondary technical schools, while Japan has 17 such colleges and 60 secondary technical schools, and the Soviet Union also has 5 colleges and 13 secondary technical schools. As for China's scientific research talents, they are even more lacking. There are only more than 80 experts with independent research capabilities in the country, and their cooperation in work is not close enough. Therefore, although China's aquatic resources are abundant, the situation is still unclear, the life and migration patterns of fish are difficult to grasp, and the methods of marine and freshwater aquaculture have not been scientifically summarized and improved. China's aquatic industry is greatly restricted by natural conditions. Under this backward scientific condition, it is difficult to develop to the deep sea and the high seas without improvement.

Due to backward production tools and insufficient understanding of resource dynamics, fishing grounds are difficult to grasp, resulting in very low yields per unit area. In addition, fishery cooperatives have not yet been sound and consolidated, and business management is not perfect. Policy issues such as the valuation of tools and repayment of principal and interest left over from the fishery cooperatives have not been resolved, which cannot but affect the production and income of fishermen. Since liberation, the lives of fishermen have been greatly improved, but generally speaking, they are still relatively poor, and some even have to rely on government relief.

Third, due to our insufficient refrigeration, transportation, and processing equipment, there are also many problems in handling fish products and supply and marketing. Since aquatic products are scattered in production areas, have strong seasonality, and require high freshness, if they cannot be handled quickly and in a timely manner during the fishing season, the phenomenon of accumulation and spoilage in the production area and the inability to eat fish in the sales area will occur. According to incomplete statistics from April to June last year, more than 1,800 tons of fish were damaged and deteriorated due to insufficient transportation, refrigeration, and processing equipment. Therefore, along with the development of aquatic production, it is how to solve problems such as transportation and processing. In areas where railway transportation is convenient, the support of the railway transportation department can solve some difficulties. However, in areas where transportation is inconvenient, problems such as damage and spoilage are difficult to solve without proper refrigeration, transportation, and processing equipment.

Fourth, due to the lack of fishing ports and fishing navigation safety equipment (there are only 127 fishing navigation lighthouse built after liberation on the 11,000-kilometer coastline), wooden sailboats are greatly affected by natural conditions, and their ability to resist wind and waves is not strong. Reliable protection has not been obtained in terms of production safety. Although maritime deaths have decreased compared with the old era, after liberation, from 1951 to 1955, there were still an average of about 500 deaths each year. In 1956, there were also 268 deaths. From January to May this year, there have been 135 deaths and 63 injuries. This situation that makes people uneasy at all times must be improved as soon as possible.

In addition, due to the subjectivism and bureaucratism of our aquatic departments, some errors have also been caused. For example, improper control of fish prices and untimely supply of fishery materials have increased the contradictions between fishermen and the government; the expansion of water surface by state-owned enterprises has caused dissatisfaction among fishermen, which has increased the contradictions between state-owned aquatic enterprises and cooperative fisheries; due to the failure to solve the problems of income distribution between fishermen and farmers in fishery-agricultural joint cooperatives in a timely and reasonable manner, the contradictions between fishermen and farmers have increased; and due to the unreasonable arrangement of the use of fishing grounds between societies, between regions, and the work point evaluation of each fisherman within the cooperative, the contradictions between fishermen and fishermen have also increased. All of these are some prominent contradictions among the people that are in front of us and need to be resolved seriously and gradually.

  Some Opinions on Current Aquatic Work

The above is only a brief description of the situation of China's aquatic resources, the situation of aquatic production, and several outstanding problems existing in the production process; now, based on our contacts in the past year, I would like to put forward the following opinions on the current aquatic work:

1.  The main force of China's current aquatic work is the vast masses of fishermen, numbering 4.57 million, who are basically cooperatized. Their production tools are backward, but their production accounts for more than 92 percent of China's total aquatic output. Today, we must rely on this main production force for production, and we must recognize this fact. However, in today's national industrialization and fishery cooperatization, aquatic work must also gradually transition from the existing handicraft production method to the mechanical production method with the development of national industrialization and the accumulation of cooperatives. This is also the direction of China's fishery development, and it is a firm direction.

In order to take care of the present and prepare for the future, it is an urgent task to rectify and strengthen cooperative fisheries, improve the lives of fishermen, and give play to their potential to develop production. At the same time, in order to develop production, summarize and promote the good experiences of Chinese fishermen for a long time, gradually improve fishery technology, reasonably arrange and utilize existing fishing grounds, open up new fishing grounds, pay attention to resource protection, prohibit the use of tools that damage resources, and gradually improve these tools are also urgently needed. Second, the life safety of coastal fishermen is a problem that we should pay close attention to today. Of course, with China's current scientific level and national financial resources, it is impossible to prevent accidents from occurring to fishermen who are engaged in production in the 11,000-kilometer ocean, but it is urgent to further strengthen fishing navigation safety equipment such as beacons, lighthouses, typhoon shelters, and alarm stations, and to minimize casualties and ensure production safety. Third, it is also necessary to vigorously develop production, rectify and consolidate fishery production cooperatives, further implement the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily" and "running cooperatives democratically," correctly handle internal contradictions of cooperatives, and better solve labor organization, income distribution, and tool valuation issues in order to improve the production enthusiasm of cooperative members and increase income. We are now collecting materials to prepare a draft of the "Fishery Cooperative Charter" to reasonably arrange these issues. Fourth, ramie, wood, iron, tung oil, and Mao bamboo are all materials that fishermen often need for production tools such as boats and nets. In order to avoid delaying production, relevant departments are required to supply them in a timely manner. Especially in the case of tight supply of materials, they should be formally included in the local material plan for planned supply in combination with resource protection.

2.  Marine and freshwater aquaculture production has low costs, high benefits, stable yields, simple management, and is convenient for fishermen and farmers to operate locally. In terms of freshwater, China has more than 50 million mu of water surface available for aquaculture, but only more than 10 million mu are currently utilized, and there is still great potential for increasing production. In the future, the utilization of water surface should be comprehensively planned. Those that can be operated by cooperatives should be assigned to cooperatives for operation. Those that cooperatives are unable to operate can adopt the method of state stocking, mass fishing, joint operation, and reasonable distribution. Lakes that can be stocked should be gradually utilized. Individual lakes that are not closely related to fishermen and farmers can be directly operated by the state after properly arranging the livelihood of relevant fishermen and farmers. In the development of aquaculture production, it is necessary to expand aquaculture varieties, promote local cultivation of fish fry, and local stocking to avoid transportation deaths, and pay close attention to solving the problems of fish feed and fish disease prevention to increase yield per unit area, fully utilize the water surface that can be utilized, and vigorously develop mass aquaculture. If we can expand the utilization of 25 million mu of water surface in the near future, calculated at 45 jin per mu, we can increase the production of 550,000 tons of fish for the country. In recent years, one-mu thousand-jin fish ponds have appeared in some places (such as the Zhejiang Linghu Qinlao Fishery Cooperative, which uses 137 mu of ponds for fish farming, with an average yield of 1060 jin per mu). Compared with thousand-jin fish ponds and thousand-jin paddy fields, the output value of fish ponds is about four to five times that of paddy fields. It can be seen that freshwater aquaculture has high yields and great benefits.

In terms of shallow sea aquaculture, there are 6.8 million mu of area available for aquaculture, but less than one-tenth of it has been utilized, and the prospects for development are also very large. Shallow sea aquaculture includes fish, shellfish, shellfish, algae, etc. There are many kinds, most of which are non-staple foods with good nutrition and high value. For example, kelp is rich in iodine and has high nutritional value. In the past, China did not have its own aquaculture. After liberation, it was successfully trial-planted in the coastal areas of Liaoning and Shandong. Last year, it was planned to be actively transplanted to the south, and now trial planting in Zhejiang and Fujian has achieved good results. This year, provinces across the country have proposed that the annual demand is 70,000 tons, but we only produce more than 1,000 tons ourselves this year, and import 3,000 tons, a total of less than 5,000 tons, which is far from meeting the needs of the people. Pearls with high economic value can be used for medicine and can also be used as decorations. Japan only earns about 25 million yuan in renminbi from pearl farming exports each year. Guangdong used to produce them in the past, but unfortunately the business was interrupted. We are now planning to engage in research and continue production. The output value of shellfish such as razor clams, cockles, and oysters in shallow sea aquaculture is also very high.

3.  State-owned marine fishing enterprises are modern enterprises and the direction of our aquatic industry development. Since liberation, this part of the enterprise has developed relatively quickly. From the perspective of the tonnage of motorized fishing vessels, it increased from more than 17,000 tons in 1952 to more than 26,600 tons in 1956, an increase of 54 percent; from the perspective of output, it increased from 51,000 tons in 1952 to more than 110,000 tons in 1956, an increase of 113 percent. However, if its output is compared with the national total output, or its power equipment is compared with the power equipment of advanced fishing countries, it is very small. At the same time, since the number of fishing vessels has increased rapidly in recent years, but the technical work has not been correspondingly improved, the output of single ships has shown a downward trend. In order to further develop modern fishery, we must actively rectify, improve and develop state-owned marine fishing enterprises, gradually carry out technological transformation, and train technical forces so that they can master modern equipment. At the same time, implement a scientific production scheduling system so that it can adapt to changes in fish conditions to solve the contradiction between developing production and backward technology. It is planned to appropriately increase a part of fishing vessels and processing equipment, rebuild and add some fishing vessel bases, and open up new fishing grounds in the Second Five-Year Plan to lay the foundation for the large-scale development of deep-sea fishing and whaling. During the Third Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to consolidate China's coastal fisheries and actively develop towards the high seas.

4.  From the perspective of aquatic output, China has become one of the world's major aquatic countries, but aquatic science and technology are still extremely backward and there is a lack of specialized personnel. The situation in this regard has been briefly stated earlier. In order to develop China's aquatic industry, especially to lay the foundation for the further development of modern fishery in the future, we must step up the training of technical personnel, enrich the equipment of aquatic scientific research, and strengthen the leadership of various aquatic experimental research departments and aquatic schools. This requires more support from the state and the assistance of various relevant government departments so that we can make more achievements under the unified planning of the state.

5.  In order to support production and ensure supply, in terms of aquatic supply and marketing, efforts should be made to improve business management, strengthen the leadership of the free market, correctly implement the fish price policy, implement zoned supply, and improve the quality of fish products. In areas with concentrated coastal production and sales, increase refrigeration, processing, and transportation equipment to prevent loss and spoilage. In inland cities and industrial and mining areas, utilize wasteland water surfaces for aquaculture, build more fish storage reservoirs, and increase the supply of fresh and live aquatic products.

In addition, aquatic agencies have changed more frequently in recent years. In the early days of liberation, they were under the Ministry of Food Industry, and later changed to the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Commerce. It was not until May of last year that the Ministry of Aquatic Products was established. Aquatic agencies in various provinces and cities have changed frequently. At present, only fifteen provinces and cities have aquatic bureaus (bureaus), and ten provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have not established the necessary aquatic agencies. The aquatic agencies in some important fishery areas below the provincial level are weak, or even have no agencies. The issues of attribution and administrative leadership are also very chaotic. Some local aquatic bureaus are led by agricultural departments, some by commercial departments, and some by urban service departments. Due to chaotic leadership, inconvenience in work is caused, and some things even fall into a state of no one being responsible. This is extremely detrimental to the development of production. We hope that the government will promptly and appropriately resolve it when studying the system issue.

  Hope for Support and Assistance from All Parties

Dear representatives, please allow me to end my speech with a few simple words.

From the perspective of aquatic resource conditions and the production experience of the broad masses of fishermen, the development prospects of China's aquatic industry are bright. From an economic, social, and national defense perspective, it is necessary to develop the aquatic industry; from the current situation of tight non-staple food supply in the market and insufficient supply of aquatic products, it is also very urgent to develop aquatic products and supply the needs of people's lives. Moreover, for this cause, the country can use relatively less investment to get more returns. We hope that all representatives will give more support in this regard, and we hope that the relevant departments of the Party and government at all levels will further attach importance to aquatic work and give appropriate arrangements and assistance. Since the socialist economy is a planned and interconnected whole of various economic sectors, the aquatic industry must rely on the support and cooperation of various relevant departments to achieve due development. In the past, various relevant government departments have given great support to our work, especially our heroic navy, which has given great assistance in protecting the production and safety of fishermen at sea. On behalf of the national fishermen and all aquatic workers, I would like to express my gratitude.

The Ministry of Aquatic Products was established at the end of May 1956, and it has only been a little over a year now. We, especially myself, are still learning, and we don't know much about the situation, and there are many shortcomings and errors. The representatives are concerned about the aquatic industry. In the past year, they have repeatedly gone deep into the fishing areas during inspections and put forward many valuable opinions on aquatic work, which have played a great role in helping us improve our work. For the opinions put forward by the representatives, some of us have already started to do, some are studying to do, and all have been answered promptly. In order to correctly handle the contradictions among the people and implement the policy of "building the country diligently and thriftily" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," we hope that the representatives will supervise our aquatic work from time to time and give us more guidance and help.

    我国水产事业的远大前途
    许德珩的书面发言
    请允许我报告一下我国水产事业的主要情况并提出今后水产工作的意见，请求批评、指正：
    水产资源丰富　生产条件优越
    我国的水产资源丰富。从海洋来说，东南两面临海，海岸线长一万一千多公里，在这辽阔的海洋里，北方的寒流和南方的暖流，交错汇合，内陆江河夹带大量有机物质注入，饵料丰富，适宜多种鱼类和其他水生动植物大量的栖息和繁殖，沿海岸和邻近的公海，在水深二百公尺以内宜于渔业生产的海区，有四十三万六千平方海里。从内陆来说，我国江河湖泊，纵横罗列，池塘沼泽，棋布星罗，可供捕捞和养殖的水面约一亿六千余万亩，另外还有日益增多的山塘水库，可以养鱼，南方稻田可以养鱼的亦复不少。淡水养鱼既不占农田，而且成本低、利益大、收效快，已普遍地成为渔民和农民的专业和副业。养鱼事业在我国有悠久的历史，丰富的经验，历来就把“鱼”和人民最必需的“米盐”相提并论，同称“富国之源”。总之，无论从海洋和淡水来看，我国的水产都有它优越的生产条件，这是我国社会主义建设事业可以利用的无限宝藏之一，同时也可以看出我国水产事业发展的远大前途。
    水产品是人民生活中重要的一种副食品，它的营养价值高，孟子虽然在“不可得兼”的情况之下而选择熊掌，但“鱼”却是他“所欲”的一种食品。中国人民表示自己的生活之美好是“吃鱼吃肉”，称富裕之区是“鱼米之乡”，这也可以表现鱼在人民生活中的地位。在目前，发展水产不仅可以适应人民对副食品日益增长的需要，缓和肉类供应的紧张，而且在工业、农业、医药方面都有广泛的用途。我国水产品近年向国外出口，在国际市场上受到广泛欢迎，供不应求，出口一吨对虾可换回六吨钢材，一吨虾米可换回九吨半钢材。因此，发展水产，增加人民副食品供应，扩大出口，换取外汇，支援国家建设，意义是重大的。
    水产事业是一种投资少、容纳劳动力大的群众生产事业。发展水产可以扩大劳动就业人数，解决很大一部分人民的生活问题。俗话说“三山六水一分田”又说“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”，我国地少人多，垦荒不易，上山下水，都是必要的出路，而从解决人民就业问题来说，“吃水”的意义更大。目前我国渔业人口约为四百五十七万，加上其他从业人口约在六百万左右。据初步计算，如第二个五年计划能把水产产量增长到四百三十万吨，就可以解决近一千万人的生活问题。因此，从发展水产事业来解决劳动就业问题，是今天值得我们注意的一个重大问题。
    在四百五十七万渔民中，沿海渔民约占一半以上，这些世代聚居在漫长的海岸线上从事生产的劳动人民，他们不仅时时刻刻要在惊涛骇浪中同大自然作斗争，而且还要与虎视眈眈的帝国主义者海盗们作保卫祖国的斗争。因此，发展水产事业，改善并安定沿海渔民生活，是巩固国防的重要方策之一。现在在我国东北沿海的对面有李承晚集团，在南方有吴庭艳集团，而我国领土台湾还在美帝控制之下，这些凶恶敌人，在我国沿海区域掳劫骚扰，斗争十分尖锐。我国渔民和国营机轮渔业工作人员，在这样复杂尖锐的斗争情况下，坚持生产，并配合英勇的海军，警卫祖国海防，成为沿海一支保卫祖国的尖兵。因此，发展水产事业、做好渔民工作，对我国的海防来说，是有极其重大意义的。
    发展中的缺点和问题
    解放以来，由于党和政府的正确领导，各级水产工作人员的努力，广大渔民积极性的提高，渔业合作化已基本实现，国营生产企业已有了初步的基础，水产供销企业也普遍地建立起来，使得我国水产事业有了较大的发展。解放前，历史上最高年产量是一九三六年，这一年的产量是一百五十万吨，以后迭经日、伪、蒋反动政权的破坏，一九四九年产量降至四十五万吨。解放后，到一九五二年完成经济恢复时期，全国水产产量已达到一百六十六万吨，超过历史上最高记录百分之十一，以后逐年都有所发展，到去年，总产量已达到二百六十四万吨，比一九五二年又增加了百分之五十九强，跃居世界的第三位。今年的计划产量是二百八十一万六千吨，解放后的这些成绩，我们是应该加以肯定的。
    但是毋庸讳言，我国的水产事业今天仍存在着许多缺点和问题：
    首先，就目前我国水产产量和水产资源来比较，并就水产产量与人民生活需要来比较，都是很不相称的。如前所述，我国沿海渔场面积有四十三万六千平方海里，内陆可供养殖与捕捞的水面又很多，可是，我国的海洋淡水总产量却只占世界总产量十分之一左右。再按人口来作比较，如以去年我国人口和水产产量平均计算，每人每年只有八市斤半，而苏联平均每人有二十七市斤，英、美都约三十市斤，日本竟达到一百零五市斤。如按我国计划中的发展速度，第二个五年计划产量增至四百三十万吨时，每人每年平均也不过十三市斤，还远落于上述国家之后。
    其次，我国水产事业的主要生产者是四百五十七万渔民中一百五十万有劳动力的渔民，他们主要的生产工具是四十四万条无动力的木帆船，他们是靠这些船只来进行生产的，国营渔轮目前只有四百艘，二万七千吨，再加上渔民的机帆船七百多条，这些机动渔船一共只有一千一百余艘，载重量仅四万余吨，占我国渔船的总载重量百分之三点六，只占日本动力渔船吨数的百分之四。
    我国水产科学落后，目前全国水产科学研究机构仅有十一处，而且大部分基础薄弱，日本这样的科学研究机构则有六十处，苏联也有二十九处。水产高等学校我国只有一所，综合大学中只有一个大学有水产系，中等技术学校只有四所，而日本则有这样的高等学校十七所，中等技术学校六十所，苏联也有高等学校五所，中等技术学校十三所。至于我国科学研究人才则更形缺乏，全国有独立研究能力的专家仅八十余人，他们在工作上互相协作也还不够密切。因此，我国水产资源虽然丰富，但情况还摸不清楚，鱼类生活和洄游规律不易掌握，海洋淡水养殖方法，未能加以科学的总结与提高，我国水产事业受自然条件的限制很大，在此种科学落后的情况下，若不加以改进，而求向深海远洋发展是很困难的。
    由于生产工具落后，资源动态不够了解，渔场难于掌握，以致单位产量很低，加以渔业合作社尚未健全巩固，经营管理不够完善，渔业合作社中遗留下来的工具折价、还本付息等政策性问题尚未解决，不能不影响到渔民的生产和收入。解放以来，渔民的生活虽大大提高，但一般说来还比较苦，有的甚至要靠政府救济。
    第三，由于我们的冷藏、运输和加工的设备不足，在处理鱼品和供销方面，也存在着不少问题。由于水产品的产地分散，生产的时间性强，鲜活性的要求高，在渔汛期间，如不能迅速及时的处理，就要形成产地积压臭烂而销地吃不上鱼的现象。根据去年四月到六月间不完全的统计，由于运输、冷藏、加工设备不够而损坏变质的鱼就达一千八百多吨。因此，随着发展水产生产而来的，就是如何解决运销加工等类问题，在铁道运输便利的地方，得到铁道交通部门的支持，可以解决若干困难。可是，交通不便的地方，如无适当的冷藏、运输、加工设备，损坏臭烂问题就难解决。
    第四，由于渔港及渔航安全设备缺乏（在一万一千多公里长的海岸线上，仅有解放后才开始建立的渔用航标灯塔一百二十七处），木帆船受自然条件的影响很大，抵抗风浪的能力不强，在生产安全方面，还未能得到可靠的保障，海上死亡事故虽比旧时代减少，但解放以后，从一九五一年到一九五五年，平均每年仍有五百人左右的死亡，一九五六年也还死亡二百六十八人，今年一至五月已有一百三十五人死亡和六十三人受伤的不幸事故，这种使人时刻不安的情况必须从速加以改善。
    另外，由于我们水产部门领导上的主观主义和官僚主义，也造成若干的错误。如由于鱼价掌握不当，渔需物资供应不及时等等，就增加了渔民与政府之间的矛盾；由于国营企业扩大水面，引起渔民的不满，这就增加了国营水产企业与合作社渔业之间的矛盾；由于渔农结合社中渔民和农民的收益分配等问题未能及时地、合理地解决，就增加了渔民与农民之间的矛盾；又由于社与社间，地区与地区间渔场使用问题，合作社内部每个渔民的工分评比等问题未得到合理的安排，也增加了渔民与渔民之间的矛盾。所有这些，都是摆在我们面前一些突出的人民内部的矛盾，需要我们认真地、逐步地加以解决的。
  对当前水产工作的几点意见
    上面仅就我国水产资源情况、水产生产情况以及在生产进程中所存在的几个突出的问题，略陈梗概；现在再就一年来我们接触所及，对当前水产工作，提出下面的几点意见：
    1．我国目前水产工作的主力，是靠四百五十七万广大的基本上合作化了的渔民群众，他们的生产工具是落后的，而他们的生产量却占我国水产总产量百分之九十二以上，目前要依靠这支生产主力来进行生产，我们必须认清这一事实。可是在国家工业化和渔业合作化的今天，水产工作又必须随着国家工业化的发展和合作社的积累，从现有的手工业生产方式，逐步地过渡到机械的生产方式，这也是我国渔业发展的方向，并且是一定不移的方向。
    为了照顾现在，准备将来，整顿并加强合作社渔业，改善渔民生活，发挥他们的潜力来发展生产，是目前当务之急，同时，为发展生产，总结并推广我国渔民悠久的好的经验，逐步改进渔业技术，合理地安排和利用现有渔场，开辟新的渔场，注意资源保护，禁止使用损害资源的工具，逐步改进这些工具，这也是迫切需要的。第二、沿海渔民生命安全问题是今天我们应当高度注意的一个问题。当然，以我国目前科学水平和国家财力，要求在一万一千多公里的海洋中进行生产的渔民不发生事故，是不可能的，不过进一步地加强航标、灯塔、避风港、警报站等渔航安全设备，极力减少伤亡事故，保障生产安全，又是急不可缓的。第三、从大力发展生产，整顿巩固渔业生产合作社，进一步地贯彻“勤俭办社”“民主办社”的方针，正确处理合作社内部矛盾，更好地解决劳动组织、收益分配、工具折价问题，以提高社员生产积极性，来增加收入，也是必要的，我们现正搜集材料准备起草“渔业合作社章程”，合理地安排这些问题。第四、苎麻、木材、铁料、桐油、毛竹等都是渔民的生产工具如船、网等类经常需要的物资，为了作到不耽误生产，要求有关部门能够及时供应，特别在物资供应紧张的情况下，更应结合资源保护，正式列入地方物资计划，有计划地供应。
    2．海洋、淡水养殖生产，成本低、利益大、产量稳定、管理简便，便于渔民和农民就地经营。在淡水方面，我国可供养殖的水面五千余万亩，现只利用一千余万亩，增产潜力还很大。今后要全面规划水面的利用，凡合作社可以经营的，应划归合作社经营，合作社无力经营的，可采取国家放养、群众捕捞、联合经营、合理分成的办法。对可放养的湖泊逐步利用起来，个别与渔民和农民关系不大的湖泊，可在妥善安排有关的渔民和农民的生活出路以后，由国家直接经营。在发展养殖生产中，需要扩大养殖品种，提倡就地培育鱼苗，就地放养，以免运输死亡，并切实注意解决养鱼饲料和鱼病防治等问题，以提高单位产量，充分利用可以利用的水面，大力开展群众养殖业。如果我们最近能够扩大利用水面二千五百万亩，即以每亩产量四十五市斤计算，就能为国家增产五十五万吨鱼。近年来在一些地方出现了一亩千斤鱼塘（如浙江菱湖勤劳渔业社利用137亩池塘养鱼，平均每亩产1060斤），如以千斤鱼塘与千斤稻田相比，鱼塘的产值约为稻田的四倍到五倍。可见淡水养殖的产量高，利益是很大的。
    在浅海养殖方面，可供养殖的面积有六百八十万亩，现已利用的还不到十分之一，发展的前途也是很大的。浅海养殖有鱼、蚧、贝、藻等，种类很多，大半都是营养好、价值高的副食品。例如海带富有碘质，营养价值很高，以前我国自己没有养殖，解放以后，先后在辽宁、山东沿海试植成功。去年计划积极向南方移植，现在浙江、福建试植又获得良好的成果。今年全国各省提出全年需要量达七万吨，而我们今年自己生产的只千余吨，进口三千吨，两共不到五千吨，远不能满足人民的需要。经济价值很高的如珍珠，可以制药，又可以做装饰品，日本仅养珠一项，每年出口获利折人民币约二千五百余万元。我国广东过去曾有出产，可惜经营中断，我们现拟从事研究，继续生产。浅海养殖的蛏、蚶、牡犡等贝类，产值也是很高的。
    3．国营海洋捕捞企业，是现代化的企业，是我们水产事业发展的方向。解放以来，这一部分企业发展比较快。从机动渔轮的吨位来说，一九五二年一万七千余吨，一九五六年二万六千六百余吨，增长了百分之五十四；从产量来看，一九五二年五万一千吨，一九五六年达到十一万余吨，增长了百分之一百一十三。可是若把它的产量与全国总产量来比，或是把它的动力装备与渔业先进国家的动力装备来比，那都是很小的。同时，由于近来渔轮增加的较快，而技术工作未能相应的提高，单位船只产量有降低的趋势。为着进一步发展现代化渔业，我们对国营海洋捕捞企业目前是要积极地加以整顿、提高和发展，逐步进行技术改造，培养技术力量，使能掌握现代化的设备。同时，实行科学的生产调度制度，使能适应鱼情变化，以解决发展生产与技术落后的矛盾。准备在第二个五年计划中，适当地增加一部分渔轮和加工设备，改建并增建一些渔轮基地，开辟新的渔场，为大量发展远洋捕捞和捕鲸等打下基础。要在第三个五年计划期间，巩固我国的近海渔业，积极地向远洋发展。
      4．从水产产量来说，我国目前已成为世界主要的水产国家之一，但水产科学技术还极落后，专门人才缺乏，前面已就这方面的情况略加陈述，为发展我国水产事业，特别是为今后进一步发展现代化渔业打下基础，我们必须加紧技术人员的培养，充实水产科学研究的设备，加强各个水产试验研究部门和水产学校的领导，这更需要国家给我们支援，政府各有关部门的协助，使能在国家统一规划之下做出更多的成绩来。
    5．为了支持生产、保证供应，在水产供销工作方面，应努力改进经营管理，加强自由市场的领导，正确地贯彻鱼价政策，实行划区供应，提高鱼品质量。在沿海产销集中的地区，增加冷藏、加工、运输设备，防止损失臭烂。在内地城市和工矿区域，利用荒废水面，进行养殖，多建储鱼水库，增加鲜活水产供应。
    此外，年来水产机构变动较多，解放初期，曾隶属食品工业部，后改属农业部、商业部，至去年5月才成立水产部。各省市水产机构变动频繁，目前全国只有十五个省、市有水产厅（局），还有十个省、市、自治区未设立必要的水产机关，省以下某些重要渔业区的水产机构薄弱，甚至没有机构。归口和行政领导问题也十分零乱，地方上的水产局，有的由农业部门领导，有的由商业部门领导，也有的由城市服务部门领导，由于领导零乱，造成工作上的不便，有些事情甚至陷于无人负责状态。这是极不利于生产发展的，我们希望政府在研究体制问题时，从速加以适当的解决。
  希望各方面给以支持和协助
    各位代表，请允许我再用简单的几句话来结束我的发言。
    从水产资源条件和广大渔民群众的生产经验来说，我国水产事业发展的前途是远大的。从经济的、社会的、国防的观点来看，发展水产事业是必需的；从目前市场副食品供应紧张、水产品供应不足的情况看，发展水产，供应人民的生活需要，也是很迫切的，而且对于这一事业，国家可用比较少的投资得到更多的收益。我们希望各位代表在这方面更多的予以支持，更希望各级党、政有关部门进一步地重视水产工作，给以适当的安排、协助。由于社会主义经济是各个经济部门有计划的和相互联系的整体，水产事业必须依靠各有关部门的支持和协作，才能得到应有的发展。过去政府各个有关部门对于我们的工作，都给了很大的支持，特别是我们英勇的海军，在保护海上渔民生产与安全方面，给了很大的帮助，我谨代表全国渔民和全体水产职工，表示感谢。
    水产部是一九五六年五月底成立的，现在刚刚一年多一点，我们，特别是我个人现在还是在学习中，了解的情况不多，缺点和错误不少。各位代表对水产事业关心，一年以来，在视察中曾多次深入渔区，对水产工作提了不少的宝贵意见，对帮助我们改进工作，起了很大的作用。对于代表们所提的意见，我们有的已经开始在作，有的正在研究去作，并都即时地加以答复。为了正确地处理人民内部矛盾，贯彻“勤俭建国”“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，希望各位代表对我们水产工作，时加监督，给予我们更多的指教和帮助。
