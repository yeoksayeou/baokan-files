China's Water Conservancy Achievements Are Unmatched by Any Era Before Liberation
Xu Kai's Speech

I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li and Bo, and Vice Chairman Peng, and suggest that the congress approve them. Below, I would like to express some opinions specifically on the water conservancy construction before and after liberation.

During the rectification movement of the Communist Party, the rightists, with ulterior motives, confused right and wrong, reversed black and white, slandered the Communist Party, obliterated achievements, and even clamored loudly: "China has been ruined by the Communist Party," "The socialist system is the root of all evils," etc., which is absurd and intolerable. It is entirely necessary for the people of the whole country to refute and shatter the nonsense of the rightists with ironclad facts from the actual achievements in all aspects. Now, based on my personal experience of engaging in water conservancy work for forty consecutive years, I will make a rough comparison of the overall situation of the national water conservancy undertakings before and after liberation, to see whether our China has been ruined or improved by the Communist Party.

First, let's look at agricultural production, which best reflects the achievements of water conservancy construction, and how the situation of major grain production has changed. Before liberation, water and drought disasters continued year after year, so grain production could not be self-sufficient and had to rely on large amounts of imports from abroad. At that time, "Siamese rice," "Saigon rice," and "American flour" filled the market. Today, the elders present can remember, and the old customs import statistics materials can fully confirm this point. China was known as a major agricultural country, but its agricultural production was so low at that time. In 1949, when the country was liberated, the national grain output was only more than 210 billion jin. After several years of agricultural and water conservancy construction and the achievements of socialist transformation of agriculture, the national output reached 365 billion jin in 1956, solving the problem of feeding the people of the whole country, and a small amount can also be exported. Some people may think that such a change is nothing. True, looking ahead, it is still far from the goal we require in the "Agricultural Development Program," so it is nothing. However, if we recall the decades before liberation, it becomes a very precious page. It should be pointed out that China's agricultural production has not yet shaken off the influence of nature. Water and drought disasters still exist as usual, and sometimes they are still quite serious in different regions. It will take a long period of arduous struggle to gradually overcome natural disasters. However, judging from the development of national agricultural production, it should be admitted that the severity of water and drought disasters has begun to be alleviated to some extent, and fundamental changes have taken place in individual regions. Otherwise, it would be difficult to form a national situation of year-by-year increase in agricultural production. Closely related to this issue, I would like to talk about the changes in the main rivers before and after liberation, which can help explain the internal situation.

Eight Years of Water Conservancy Construction Have Changed the Face of Many Perennially Disaster-Stricken Areas

First, talking about the Yellow River, because the current channel of the Yellow River has been silting up for about a hundred years and is becoming increasingly elevated, and because of the indifference and incompetence of the ruling class in the old era, in the Kuomintang era, floods with a flow rate of about 3,000 cubic meters per second would cause breaches. Statistics show that breaches could occur twice every three years. The northern breaches flooded the North China Plain, and the southern breaches devastated the Huai River Plain. The sinking and suffering were deeply etched in the memories of hundreds of millions of people in the two major plains, even more so than in my own. However, since the lower reaches of the Yellow River have been in the hands of the people for ten years, the flood season flow rate is generally above 3,000 cubic meters per second, and in many years it is around 16,000 cubic meters per second, and the Yellow River has never breached. This is mainly because the People's Government has invested huge efforts to thoroughly strengthen the embankment works, thereby reversing the old situation of breaching twice every three years. Imagine, if the Yellow River still followed the same breaching pattern as before, then there would have been five or six breaches in the past ten years, which would have caused incalculable huge disasters. The contrast between the past and the present is truly worlds apart.

As for the fundamental control of the Yellow River, it was only a distant and lofty ideal for us before liberation. But now the Sanmenxia Reservoir has officially started construction. In another five years or so, the historical appearance of the Yellow River will be completely changed; the annotation that "the Yellow River is a scourge of China" will become a historical relic. This is unimaginable in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Without the Communist Party and without the socialist system, could such deeds have appeared? It is absolutely impossible.

Secondly, talking about the Yongding River, it is recorded in the history of Chinese water conservancy with the alias of "Little Yellow River," because its harmful nature is the same as that of the Yellow River, only the river is shorter and the water volume is smaller. During the first five-year plan, we completed the Guanting Reservoir. This river, named Yongding but actually moving and unsettled for a long time, truly entered the Yongding stage. At the same time, the flood that was once feared like a beast has been tamed to generate bright electricity and has flowed slowly into the capital of the people, serving the needs of the people's lives. Just look, how could such a great act of changing nature and changing history be imagined before liberation that it would appear before our eyes in just a few years!

In addition, among the rivers in North China, the Chaobai River has opened up a new downstream channel, the Daqing River has opened up the Duliujian River, and the Zhangwei River has preliminarily dredged the Sinvsi River. The main thing is to expand the flood discharge to the sea within the scope of the current actual possibilities. The completed project undoubtedly still cannot fully meet the requirements for eliminating water hazards, but compared with the old days, due to the increased discharge during the flood season and the accelerated drainage after the flood season, the scope and depth of the water disaster have undoubtedly been reduced. If there were no water control projects in recent years during the great floods of 1954 and last year, the disaster would have been even more serious, and Tianjin might not have been spared. I think this assessment is not an exaggeration.

The governance of the Huai River is familiar to everyone. The Huai River basin used to be in a situation of "heavy rain brings heavy disaster, light rain brings light disaster, and no rain brings drought." Since liberation, on the one hand, the fundamental situation of mutual interference and harm among the floods of the Huai, Yi, Si, and Shu rivers has been changed. The main thing is to open up sea routes for the floods of the Yi and Shu rivers respectively, eliminating the lateral threat to the Huai River basin; on the other hand, the Huai River itself is used for both storage and discharge, and the principle of treating both trunk and tributary and taking into account both upstream and downstream is followed. Reservoirs are built, river channels are dredged, lakes and depressions are controlled and utilized, the tail estuaries entering the Yangtze River and the sea are expanded, and efforts are actively made to promote various governance projects. At the current stage, regardless of heavy rain, light rain, or no rain, the size of the old disasters in terms of area and the depth of the disasters have been greatly reduced, changing the old situation. Among them, the Lixiahe area in northern Jiangsu has been freed from the historical situation of frequent water and drought disasters. It should be said that the achievements of the Huai River governance are very significant.

In the Yangtze River basin, in addition to strengthening the embankment works, flood diversion in Jingjiang, flood diversion in the lower reaches of the Hanshui River, and the regulation of Dongting South Lake have been carried out to eliminate disasters under certain flood standards. New water conservancy measures have also been implemented to varying degrees in other rivers across the country, resulting in new results. If people seize the opportunity to go and see in person and compare the current situation with the past, they can deeply understand how much change has taken place in just eight years, an unexpected change forward!

Irrigation Area Expanded After Liberation Exceeds Half of the Past National Irrigation Area

Now let's look at the development of irrigation, another important aspect of water conservancy construction. In 1949, the national irrigation area was only more than 300 million mu, which reached more than 500 million mu in 1956, that is to say, about 200 million mu have been expanded since liberation, more than half of the irrigation area accumulated over thousands of years. More than 100 million mu of it was expanded in 1956 alone, which is enough to fully illustrate the superiority of the socialist system and its incomparably great power.

In addition to irrigation, anti-logging projects of varying degrees have also been promoted in logging areas after liberation, benefiting an area of ​​more than 90 million mu.

To sum up, it can be seen that since liberation, the Party and the government have led the people of the whole country to launch a strong battle against natural disasters, which is an unprecedented battle in the history of our country; due to the vast area of ​​our country, the large number of river systems, and the severity of historical disasters, it will be a long-term and arduous task to comprehensively and thoroughly eliminate disasters. However, in the initial stage of this year's battle, great achievements have been made, thus ensuring the continuous growth of agricultural production, which is an undeniable fact.

The Level of Water Conservancy Science and Technology Has Been Significantly Improved, and Large Dams and Dams Can Generally Be Designed and Constructed by Themselves

In addition to water conservancy construction and flood control and irrigation, the development speed of hydropower generation is also rare, which has been discussed by Representative Yu Kaiquan, so I won’t say more. In terms of shipping construction, such as the renovation of Tanggu Port, the construction of Zhanjiang Port, the regulation of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the construction of countless ship lock projects on plain rivers, have all played an unprecedented role in water transportation.

Finally, what is also worth mentioning is that China's water conservancy science and technology have been significantly improved after liberation. As far as I know, before 1927, even a small sluice gate, such as the Jinshui Sluice in Hubei and the Shuangjin Sluice in northern Jiangsu, was designed by foreign engineers. This was not because the technicians at that time were so incompetent, but because the government at that time was fond of foreigners and superstitious about foreigners. From 1927 to the eve of liberation, Chinese technicians designed and built a small number of ship locks, spillway gates, and small hydropower stations, which are not worth mentioning from the current point of view. In short, in that period, there were wars, famines, and man-made disasters. The whole country could not talk about water conservancy construction, let alone the use of water conservancy technology, let alone the improvement of water conservancy technology.

After liberation, as mentioned above, water conservancy construction was actively carried out on a national scale. In addition to cultivating talents from schools, the Party and the government gave full trust to the original technicians, so that everyone could get good opportunities to exercise and improve their technical level in work practice. Especially in practical work, they received guidance and training from the exquisite technology of Soviet experts, and the improvement was even faster. At present, it can be said that except for difficult projects such as the Sanmenxia Dam on the Yellow River, large dams, dams, hydropower stations, etc. at the general international level can basically use their own technical forces to complete the entire design and construction. Of course, when encountering special difficult problems, it is still necessary to rely on the help of Soviet experts. In short, the current level of water conservancy technology cannot be compared with the old days, which is also a major achievement since liberation.

It can be seen that since liberation, water conservancy construction has progressed rapidly, which is unmatched by any era before liberation. This is an ironclad fact. However, all of us water conservancy workers realize that the current progress of water control work is far from meeting the requirements of socialist economic construction, nor can it meet the requirements of the people of the whole country to continuously improve their living standards. At the same time, it is admitted that there are many shortcomings and mistakes in the work, such as the failure of soil and water conservation work, the failure of agriculture, forestry and water conservancy departments to closely cooperate; the failure of large and small projects to be organically linked regardless of flood control, irrigation, or logging; the failure to unify planning for agricultural water conservancy and industrial water conservancy; some planning and design standards are too high and some have no standards; the failure to conduct reasonable research and solutions in advance between current interests and long-term interests, and between partial interests and overall interests; the failure of scientific research to closely combine with production needs, etc., which have brought more or less losses to various water conservancy undertakings. Therefore, there should not be any complacency about the existing achievements, and criticism from the people of the whole country is needed for the shortcomings and mistakes in order to achieve the purpose of improving the work. However, we must use iron fists to smash the conspiracy of the rightists who deliberately confuse black and white and obliterate the achievements of the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party, and protect socialist construction like protecting our eyes, and forever advance victoriously!

### 我国水利建设的成就是解放前任何时代不能比拟的  须恺的发言

专栏：

    我国水利建设的成就是解放前任何时代不能比拟的
    须恺的发言
    我完全同意周总理，李、薄副总理和彭副委员长的各项报告并建议大会予以通过。下面我想专就解放前后的水利建设问题表达一些意见。
    在共产党整风运动中，右派分子别有用心，混淆是非，颠倒黑白，诬蔑共产党，抹煞成绩，甚至大声叫嚷：“中国被共产党搞糟了”，“社会主义制度是一切祸害的根源”等等，荒谬绝伦，令人不可容忍。全国人民从各个方面的实际成就，以铁一般的事实来斥责粉碎右派分子的胡言乱语，是完全必要的。现在凭我从事水利工作连续四十年的亲身体会，将解放前后的全国水利事业面貌，就荦荦大者轮廓性的对比一下，看一看究竟我们中国给共产党搞糟了还是搞好了？
    首先，看一看最足以反映水利建设成就的农业生产，主要的粮食生产的情况发生了怎样一种变化。解放以前，水旱灾荒，连年不绝，因之粮食生产年年不能自给而必须依赖国外大量进口，当时“暹逻米”“西贡米”“花旗面粉”充斥市场，今日在座长者都能记忆，旧日海关进口货物统计材料更能充分证实这一点。中国号称农业大国，而当时的农业生产，就是那样低落。在全国解放的一九四九年全国粮食产量仅有二千一百多亿斤，经过几年来的农业和水利建设以及农业社会主义改造的成就，一九五六年全国产量达到了三千六百五十亿斤，解决了全国人民吃饱的问题，还有小量可以出口。这样的转变，有人或者觉得算不了什么，不错，我们望前看，距离我们在“农业发展纲要”中所要求的目标还远，是算不了什么，但是如果回忆一下解放前的几十年经过，就成为大可珍贵的一页了。应该指出，我国农业生产还没有摆脱自然影响，水旱灾害，照常存在，而且有时在不同地区，还相当严重，必须经过长时期的艰苦斗争，才能逐步战胜天灾。但是从全国农业生产的发展事实看，应该承认水旱灾害的深度已开始有所减轻，个别地区并已有了根本性的转变，否则就很难形成农业上全国性的逐年增产局面。紧密联系这个问题，我想谈一谈几条主要河流的解放前后的变化面貌，可以帮助说明问题的内在情况。
    八年的水利建设已经使许多常年受灾的地区改变了面貌
    第一谈到黄河，由于黄河现道经过一百年左右的淤积而日趋高仰，由于旧时代统治阶级的漠视和无能，在国民党时代，洪水流量达到三千秒公方左右就会发生决口，统计每三年可以发生决口两次。北决泛滥华北平原，南决糜烂淮河平原，陆沉惨痛，两大平原亿万人民的记忆中，比我当更为深切。但是自从黄河下游掌握在人民手中十年以来，汛期流量一般都在三千秒公方以上，不少年次在一万六千秒公方左右，而黄河未曾有过溃决，主要是由于人民政府投下了巨大力量，彻底加强了大堤工事，从而扭转了旧时三年两决的局面。设想一下，如果黄河仍像从前一样的决口规律，那末十年以来，就会发生过五六次决口，就会造成过没法计算的巨大灾害。前后对比，真不可同日而语。
    至于根治黄河，我们在解放以前只是一种遥远的崇高的理想而已，可是现在三门峡水库已经正式开工了，再有五年左右，黄河的历史面貌，就将彻头彻尾的改变了；“黄河是中国的祸害”的按语，就将成为历史陈迹了，这是古今中外所不能想像的，如果没有共产党，没有社会主义制度，能有这样的事迹出现么？是绝对不可能的。
    其次，谈到永定河，它是以“小黄河”的别号载在中国水利史上的，因为它的为害性质和黄河一样，仅仅河流较短水量较小而已。我们在第一个五年计划期间，就完成了官厅水库，这个名为永定而实际上长期迁徙无定的河流，才真正的进入了永定阶段。同时旧日畏之如猛兽的洪水，已经驯服的发出了光明的电，已经细水长流的进入了人民首都，为人民生活需要服务。试看，这样的改变自然、改变历史的伟举，解放以前如何能想像到只在短短几年时期就会呈现在我们眼前么！
    此外，在华北河流中，潮白河开辟了下游新河道，大清河开辟了独流减河，漳卫河初步疏浚了四女寺减河，主要的是就目前实际可能范围，扩大洪水出海泄量。已成工事，没有疑义对消除水害的要求还远远不能适应，但是同旧日相比，由于汛期泄量加大，汛后泄水加快，对于水灾的范围和深度均得减轻，是没有疑义的。如1954年和去年那样大水，如果没有几年来的治水工事，灾情一定更为严重，天津市亦恐难以幸免，我想这个成绩估计，并不夸大罢。
    淮河的治理，大家比较熟悉。淮河流域，从前是“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，无雨旱灾”的局面。解放以来，一方面将淮、沂、泗、沭各河洪水互相干扰为害的根本状况加以变革，主要的将沂、沭洪水各自开辟出海道路，消除了淮河流域的侧面威胁；一方面对淮河本身在蓄泄兼施，干支并治，上下游兼顾的方针原则下，修筑水库，浚治河槽，控制利用湖泊洼地，扩大入江入海尾闾，积极推进各项治理工事不遗余力。在目前阶段，不论大雨、小雨、无雨，旧日的灾害在区域的大小方面，在灾情的深度方面，已经大大减轻，改变了旧时面貌，其中如苏北里下河区域，已经摆脱了历史上经常水旱灾害的局面，应该说治淮成绩是十分显著的。
    在长江流域，除加强了堤防工事以外，举办了荆江分洪，汉水下游分洪，洞庭南湖整治等等蓄泄操纵工事，在一定的洪水标准下，消灭了灾害。全国其它河流，同样也都在不同程度上实施了新的水利措施，产生了新的成效。如果人们争取机会实地去看一看，拿目前的情况和过往的比一比，就可以深切知道短短八年中间，已经起了多么大的变化，一种想不到的前进的变化！
    解放后扩大灌溉面积已超过了过去全国灌溉面积的一半
    现在再从水利建设的另一重要方面，灌溉事业的发展方面看一看。在一九四九年全国灌溉面积仅有三亿多亩，到一九五六年达到了五亿多亩，就是说，解放以来扩大了两亿亩左右，比几千年来积累所得的灌溉面积的半数还多，其中有一亿多亩更是在一九五六年一年之中扩展的，这足以充分说明社会主义制度的优越性和无比伟大的力量。
    灌溉以外，解放后对沥涝地区也推进了不同程度的防涝工事，受益面积有九千多万亩。
    综上所述，可以看到解放以来，党和政府领导全国人民，对于自然灾害，已经展开了强有力的战斗，是我国历史上向所未有的战斗；由于我国幅员的广大，河系的众多，历史性灾害的深重，要想全面彻底消除灾害是长期的艰苦工作。但是在这几年战斗的开始阶段，已经取得了巨大成就，从而保障了农业生产的不断增长，是不可否认的事实。
    水利科学技术水平显著提高大闸大坝一般自己都可设计施工
    水利建设，防洪灌溉事业以外，在水力发电事业方面，发展速度也是难能少有的，于开泉代表已经有所论述，不再多说。在航运建设方面，如塘沽港的整修，湛江港的兴筑，长江上游航道的整治，以及平原河流无数船闸工程的建筑，都对水上交通运输起了前所未有的功效。
    末了，也是值得特别提到的，是我国水利科学技术在解放以后获得了显著提高。就我所知道，在一九二七年以前，虽则一个小小的水闸，例如湖北的金水闸，苏北的双金闸，还是外国工程师所设计的，这不是当时的技术人员无能到那样地步，乃是当时政府媚外和迷信洋人所形成的。一九二七年以后，直到解放前夕，我国技术人员自己设计建筑了少数船闸、泄水闸和小型水电站，从现在看来，那是无足称道的。总而言之，在那个时期，兵荒马乱，天灾人祸，整个国家谈不到水利建设，就谈不到水利技术的使用，更谈不到水利技术的提高。
    解放以后，如上面所讲，全国范围积极开展水利建设，党和政府除一方面从学校培养人才外，一方面对原有技术人员给以充分信任，使大家得到良好机会在工作实践中锻炼并提高各自的技术水平，尤其在实际工作中得到了苏联专家的精湛技术的指导和培植，提高得更为迅速。在目前可以说，除掉像黄河三门坝那样艰巨工程外，一般国际水平的大闸大坝和水电站等，基本上可以运用自己的技术力量来完成全部设计和施工，当然碰到特殊疑难问题，还必须依靠苏联专家的帮助。总之，目前的水利技术水平，和旧时已不能等量齐观，这也是解放以来所获得的重大成就。
    由此可见解放以来，水利建设一日千里，是解放前任何时代所不能比拟的，是铁一般的事实。但是我们水利工作者大家都认识到目前的治水工作进度，远不能满足社会主义经济建设的要求，也不能满足全国人民不断提高生活水平的要求。同时也承认在工作中间，存在着不少缺点和错误，例如水土保持工作，农林水利各部门未能密切配合；不论防洪灌溉或治涝，大小型未能有机联系；农业水利与工业水利未能统一规划；规划设计有些标准过高有些漫无标准；目前利益和长远利益之间、局部利益和整体利益之间未能事前合理研究解决；科学研究未能与生产需要紧密结合等等，都给各项水利事业带来了或多或少的损失。因之，对于已有成绩固然不应有任何自满情绪，对于缺点和错误正需要全国人民给以批评，以达到改进工作的目的。不过，像右派分子那样故意混淆黑白，将新中国在共产党领导下的成绩一笔抹煞，那种别有用心的诡计，我们必须从各个方面伸出铁腕来粉碎它们的阴谋，如同保护眼珠一样的保护社会主义建设，永远胜利前进！
