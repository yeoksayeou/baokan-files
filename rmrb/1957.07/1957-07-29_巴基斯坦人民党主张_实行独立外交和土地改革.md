Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 28th: According to newspaper reports on the 27th, the newly formed Pakistan National People's Party will establish new parliamentary groups in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies.

The constitution of the National People's Party, adopted by the democratic parties' representatives conference on the 26th, stipulates that the party's purpose and goals are: to develop Pakistan into a completely independent, sovereign, and prosperous federal state on the basis of two autonomous units, East Pakistan and West Pakistan; to guarantee all citizens freedom of speech, action, publication, assembly, association, organization of parades and strikes; and to abolish laws that allow imprisonment without trial and abolish all other repressive laws.

The party constitution stipulates that, for the development of the entire country, the National People's Party advocates prioritizing land reform, abolishing landlordism without compensation in East Pakistan, giving land to farmers, and striving for the highest land productivity in West Pakistan in order to provide economic support.

Currently, the National People's Party has four members in the National Assembly. They are National Party leader Mian Iftikharuddin, Democratic Party leader Mahmud Ali (who resigned from the East Pakistan cabinet on the evening of the 26th), and two other members who withdrew from the People's League.

In the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly, more than thirty members will form the parliamentary group of the National People's Party, of which twenty were originally members of the People's League and twelve were originally members of the Democratic Party. The eight members who originally belonged to the National Party will represent the new party in the West Pakistan Provincial Assembly.

    巴基斯坦人民党主张
    实行独立外交和土地改革
    据新华社卡拉奇28日电　据报纸27日报道，新成立的巴基斯坦民族人民党将在国民议会和省议会中成立新的议会党团。
    民主党派代表会议26日通过的民族人民党党章规定，党的宗旨和目标是：在东巴基斯坦和西巴基斯坦两个自治单位的基础上，使巴基斯坦发展成为一个完全独立的、主权的和繁荣的联邦国家，保证全体公民有言论、行动、出版、集会、结社、组织游行和罢工的自由，废除允许不经审讯就监禁的法律和废除其他所有的镇压法律。
    党章规定，为了整个国家的发展，民族人民党主张优先进行土地改革，在东巴基斯坦无偿地废除地主制，把土地给予农民，在西巴基斯坦争取土地的最高生产力以便提供经济支持。
    目前，民族人民党在国民议会中有四名议员。他们是民族党领袖米安·伊夫蒂卡鲁丁、民主党领袖马哈茂德·阿里（他26日晚退出了东巴基斯坦内阁）和另外两位退出了人民联盟的议员。
    在东巴基斯坦省议会，三十多名议员将成立民族人民党的议会党团，其中二十名原来是人民联盟盟员，十二名原来是民主党党员。原来属于民族党的八名议员将在西巴基斯坦省议会中代表新党。
