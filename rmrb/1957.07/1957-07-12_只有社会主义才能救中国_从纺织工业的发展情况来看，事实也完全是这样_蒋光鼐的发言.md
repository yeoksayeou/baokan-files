"Only Socialism Can Save China"
The Development of the Textile Industry Proves This Completely
Speech by Jiang Guangnai

Now I will offer some opinions on the main circumstances and issues concerning the textile industry.

Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": The rapid development of productivity in our country since the founding of the People's Republic of China proves that "only socialism can save China." The development of the textile industry proves this completely.

The Great Achievements Are Undeniable

From 1935 to 1949, before the founding of the People's Republic of China, our textile industry stagnated for fourteen years. During these fourteen years, not only was no new production capacity added, but the existing equipment was not fully utilized and even suffered damage, resulting in a sharp decline in productivity. In 1949, the national cotton yarn output was only 1.8 million bales, but by 1956 it had reached 5.24 million bales, an increase of nearly two times. The output of various other textiles also increased significantly. In 1956, the output of cotton cloth was 5.8 billion meters, wool fabric 14.25 million meters, silk fabric 80.32 million meters, and gunny sacks 78.68 million, all reaching or exceeding the production levels of the final year of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

In order to enable our textile industry to embark on a path of independent development, the state used great effort to develop the production of textile raw materials and establish a modern textile machinery manufacturing industry. In terms of the production and supply of textile raw materials, with the exception of fine wool, self-sufficiency has been basically achieved for all other textile raw materials. The development of textile machinery manufacturing has also been very rapid and significant. Before liberation, all complete sets of equipment relied entirely on imports. After the founding of the People's Republic, the state built and expanded seven textile machinery manufacturing plants, progressing from being unable to design and manufacture to mastering design and manufacturing themselves, and developing a production capacity of 800,000 spindles of complete sets of cotton spinning equipment and 20,000 looms per year. This not only meets domestic needs but also exports equipment to countries in Asia and Africa such as Burma and Egypt.

During the First Five-Year Plan, the state built 44 new cotton textile mills, totaling 2.4 million spindles, which is approximately half of the total number of spindles built in old China in more than half a century. In addition, four new printing and dyeing plants, three woolen textile mills, one woolen knitting factory, and the renovation of one cotton knitting factory, and seven silk factories (one of which is a modern joint silk factory), and six jute textile mills were constructed. The Shanghai Anle and Northeast Andong artificial fiber plants were restored and renovated. The Beijing synthetic artificial fiber plant and the Baoding artificial fiber plant are under construction. After the latter two plants are put into production, they will lay the foundation for further developing China's artificial fiber industry in terms of cultivating technical strength and accumulating experience.

The textile industry, which has the longest history and the largest proportion in China's private industry, has been completely transformed into joint state-private ownership, and individual handicraft textile industry has also completed cooperation. Production and management have improved and increased after joint operation and cooperation.

The development of the textile industry has not only supplied the needs of the people's livelihood and national construction, but also accumulated funds for the state. During the First Five-Year Plan, the textile industry handed over a total of more than 2.9 billion yuan in profits to the state, which is approximately 240 percent of the state's total investment in the Ministry of Textile Industry during the First Five-Year Plan.

The development of China's textile industry proves that our path of industrialization is completely correct, and that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can the above-mentioned great achievements be made. It is clear that all the fallacies of the rightists denying the achievements are unfounded.

Problems Arising in Progress

The rapid development of China's textile industry has inevitably brought about many problems. There are also shortcomings and errors in our work. Here I would like to talk about two issues.

1.  The insufficient supply of textile raw materials and the mismatch between the distribution plans and production plans for textiles are the main contradictions in the current development of China's textile industry. In the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, agricultural production was one year of normal harvest, one year of bumper harvest, and two years of poor harvest. The unstable supply of raw materials has brought many difficulties to the development of the textile industry. There have been large fluctuations in production arrangements, machinery manufacturing, and capital construction. In addition to the objective factor of insufficient raw material supply, subjectively, the lack of forward-looking and backward-looking balance work in the annual plans and long-term plans, and the inappropriate estimation of the possibility of increasing textile raw material production, as well as the estimation of the consumption level of urban and rural people, are also factors affecting the smooth progress of production arrangements, machinery manufacturing, and capital construction.

How to solve these contradictions? I think we need to work hard in two aspects.

First, from the perspective of raw materials, the main solution still relies on increased agricultural production. At the same time, it is also very important to actively improve cotton quality and improve ginning work. In terms of raw material procurement, the procurement rate last year was only 72.52 percent. This situation has already attracted the attention of relevant parties. I also hope that further measures can be taken to ensure the completion of the cotton procurement plan in order to adapt to the needs of further development of the textile industry in the future.

Considering that the living standards of the Chinese people will gradually improve in the future, and cotton resources are limited, in the Second Five-Year Plan, the wool, hemp, silk, and other textile industries and the artificial fiber industry will have appropriate development. Therefore, in addition to cotton, the state must also start to increase the production of high-grade textile raw materials such as wool, silkworm cocoons, and ramie as soon as possible. Currently, the fine wool needed for production in our country still relies on imports. During the Second Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to vigorously improve sheep breeds and improve wool quality so that the supply of fine wool in our country can gradually achieve self-sufficiency. The output of silkworm cocoons is not high, and the quality also needs to be further improved. It is understood that the key to increasing silkworm cocoon production lies in the fact that mulberry cultivation work cannot keep up, and it is necessary to actively cultivate mulberry forests to balance silkworm eggs and mulberry leaves. At the same time, improving silkworm breeds is also a very important task. The main reason why the quality of our cocoons is not good is that the silkworm breeds have degenerated, resulting in cocoons of different sizes and uneven cocoon layers, which affects the quality of silk. Efforts should be made to improve this.

From the perspective of industry, in recent years, we have had many shortcomings in our work in utilizing existing various raw material resources. Some raw materials that should be utilized or can be utilized, such as goat cashmere, camel hair, and castor silkworm cocoons, have not been actively used to overcome technical difficulties, and research work has also progressed relatively slowly. These need to be actively and planned to be resolved in the next few years.

Another way to solve the contradiction of insufficient raw material supply is to develop the artificial fiber and synthetic fiber industries. Because our country originally had no foundation in this area, there are many difficulties in equipment, technology, and production cooperation, and the resources of artificial fiber have not been completely resolved. These need to be gradually resolved in the process of learning and construction.

Secondly, when formulating long-term plans and annual plans, it is also necessary to consider various aspects of factors, especially raw material factors, as much as possible, and reduce and avoid excessive and large changes in plans. During the First Five-Year Plan, the annual plans for the textile industry were very unbalanced. Taking cotton yarn production as an example, taking 1952 as 100, 1953 was 113, 1954 was 127, 1955 was 109, and 1956 was 145. Last year, most cotton-producing areas in our country suffered varying degrees of drought and flood disasters, and cotton harvests were poor, plus a portion of cotton was not purchased. Therefore, the planned output for 1957 was greatly reduced, directly affecting the production of weaving, printing and dyeing, knitting, reproduction, and other industries. For the more difficult industries among them, such as handmade weaving, appropriate consideration has been given when arranging plans this year. The experience of implementing the plan in recent years has proven that if we do not actively and proactively study the various laws in our economic life, we cannot distinguish which economic phenomena are temporary and individual, and which are universal and exist for a longer period. It is inevitable that we cannot connect with sales plans or raw material increase plans, and we cannot base the production and capital construction of the textile industry on an active and fully reliable basis.

Considering that agriculture in our country is still relatively backward, natural disasters cannot be completely avoided, and agricultural production is still very unstable, strengthening raw material reserves will be an important task in realizing the planned development of the textile industry. If we did not adopt the method of arranging production according to all raw materials in 1956, but rather reduced production, suppose we produced 4.8 million bales of cotton yarn, then we could store 1.5 million dan of cotton, then in 1957 we would not have encountered many difficulties in arranging production due to insufficient raw materials. How to seriously absorb the experiences and lessons of the past few years, strengthen the balance of plans, gradually increase the necessary raw material reserves, reduce excessive and large changes, thereby avoiding losses and reducing waste, will be a very important aspect of implementing the "building the country through diligence and thrift" policy in the textile industry in the future, and this aspect of work must be vigorously strengthened and improved.

2.  It is imperative to ensure and improve product quality in increasing production and practicing thrift.

In recent years, the textile industry has gained many experiences and lessons in carrying out the movement to increase production and practice thrift. The movement to increase production and practice thrift in 1955 generally emphasized thrift, which was good, but partially neglected quality. As a result, the quality of some cloth declined, causing consumer dissatisfaction. In 1956, according to the instructions of the State Council, we spent a lot of effort to reverse this situation, and the quality of products and projects generally improved. Although the movement to increase production and practice thrift in 1957 has achieved certain results, some noteworthy problems have still emerged. The fundamental issue among them is how to correctly handle the relationship between increasing production and practicing thrift and improving product quality. This is also a problem that existed in the past and will continue to exist in the future. If this problem is not resolved ideologically, it will be impossible to make a correct assessment of the past movement to increase production and practice thrift, and to draw experiences and lessons from it to correctly guide the movement to increase production and practice thrift in the future.

Because the supply of raw materials in the textile industry is not abundant, and the cost of raw materials accounts for about 80 percent of the product cost, many comrades naturally put the main attention of carrying out the movement to increase production and practice thrift on saving raw materials. But on the other hand, the quality of the raw materials themselves, whether they are used reasonably, are directly related to the quality of the products. To improve product quality, we cannot ignore the quality and focus on the raw materials.

How to solve this contradiction? I believe that the principle of handling this contradiction must be to save raw materials on the basis of ensuring quality. Under the premise of not affecting quality, savings can and should be made. However, no matter what form is adopted, any practice that reduces quality in actual effect is wrong.

Next, I would like to talk about the issue of reducing yarn count. As a direction, according to the characteristics of our country's cotton fibers being longer and finer, as well as the trend that people's consumption level will increase day by day, the yarn count can be gradually and conditionally increased. However, when changing the yarn count, we must pay attention to the practical situation of the user units and the needs of consumers. This year, among the yarn counts that have been or are preparing to be reduced, some varieties, such as double-strand khaki and line poplin, originally had thicker yarn counts, and it is reasonable to reduce them now. However, it is wrong to indiscriminately change them regardless of the object. Because after the yarn count is reduced, although the yarn used is reduced, the cotton cloth becomes thinner and weaker, and the strength also decreases. In the cotton cloth that was reduced in yarn count in the first quarter of this year, the strength of some of them decreased by more than 10 percent. This situation has already caused some adverse effects in the supply of cotton cloth. The Ministry of Textile Industry and the Ministry of Commerce have already issued a joint notice for this purpose, making clear regulations on the relevant precautions for changing yarn counts. We will urge our affiliated enterprises to earnestly implement it, and at the same time, we also hope that all representatives can regularly give guidance and supervision.

In carrying out the movement to increase production and practice thrift, it is necessary to implement the struggle against two deviations, that is, both to support the enthusiasm of the masses and adopt any suggestion with practical value, and at the same time, also pay attention to preventing any practice of one-sided thrift that disregards quality, because the quality of textiles is related to the vital interests of everyone in the country. If the quality of textiles is not good, it will damage the interests of consumers, it will cause dissatisfaction among the people, and it will create or expand contradictions among the people. Only when we truly realize the important significance of improving product quality ideologically, will we implement the spirit of ensuring product quality in our actual actions, and carry out the movement to increase production and practice thrift in a healthy manner.

Fellow representatives: Rightist elements say: "Achievements are the main thing, and shortcomings are secondary. This is formalism and a kind of dogma." Just looking at the situation in the textile industry alone is completely sufficient to refute their malicious slanders.

Our textile industry can develop so rapidly, first of all, because the leadership of the Party is correct, and it also shows the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system. However, rightist elements want to overthrow the Communist Party and overthrow socialism. The attempt of the rightist elements is very obvious, that is, to strangle the only way for China to industrialize, to make our country return to the past semi-feudal and semi-colonial status, so that imperialism can arbitrarily squeeze us and cut us up, so that the broad masses of the people are not clothed, and a few bureaucratic bourgeoisie wear fur coats in winter and silk in summer. This is something that the people of the whole country and the workers of our textile industry will resolutely not agree to! Therefore, we and the rightist elements are irreconcilable and must completely defeat them. The leadership of the Communist Party must not be weakened, and the path of socialism must not be shaken. This is the fundamental guarantee for our country's independence and prosperity, and the freedom and happiness of the people!

### “只有社会主义才能救中国”  从纺织工业的发展情况来看，事实也完全是这样  蒋光鼐的发言

专栏：

    “只有社会主义才能救中国”
    从纺织工业的发展情况来看，事实也完全是这样
    蒋光鼐的发言
    现在我就纺织工业方面的一些主要情况和问题，发表些意见。
    毛泽东主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中指出：中华人民共和国成立以来，我国生产力飞跃发展的事实，证明了“只有社会主义能够救中国”。从纺织工业的发展情况来看，事实也完全是这样。
    巨大的成绩是否认不了的
    从一九三五年到一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以前，我国纺织工业停滞达十四年之久。在这十四年中间，不仅没有增加新的生产能力，就是原有的设备也没有充分利用，甚至遭到破坏，因而生产力急骤下降。一九四九年全国棉纱产量只有一百八十万件，但是到了一九五六年已达到五百二十四万件，增加了将近两倍。其他各种纺织品的产量，也有很大的增长。一九五六年棉布产量为五十八亿公尺，呢绒一千四百二十五万公尺，丝织品八千零三十二万公尺，麻袋七千八百六十八万条，都提前达到并超过了第一个五年计划最后一年的产量水平。
    为了使我国纺织工业能走上独立自主的发展道路，国家用了很大的力量来发展纺织原料的生产，和建立近代化的纺织机器制造业。在纺织原料的生产与供应方面，除了细支羊毛外，其他的各种纺织原料已基本上做到了自给。在纺织机器制造方面，发展也是很快很大的。在解放以前，所有成套设备，全部依赖进口，在人民共和国成立以后，国家新建和扩建了七个纺织机器制造厂，由不能设计制造，到自己掌握设计制造，生产能力发展到年产棉纺机八十万锭成套设备和二万台织布机，不仅已能满足国内的需要，而且还向亚非地区的缅甸、埃及等国家输出设备。
    在第一个五年计划内，国家新建了四十四个棉纺织厂，共计二百四十万锭，约相当于旧中国在半个多世纪内所建的纱锭总数的一半，此外还新建了四个印染厂，三个毛纺织厂，一个毛针织厂，改建一个棉针织厂，和七个丝绸厂（其中一个是近代化的联合丝绸厂），六个麻纺织厂，恢复并改建了上海安乐和东北安东两个人造纤维厂，正在筹建的有北京合成人造纤维厂和保定人造纤维厂。在后两个厂投入生产以后，将在培养技术力量、积累经验等方面，为进一步发展我国的人造纤维工业打下基础。
    我国私营工业中历史最久、比重最大的纺织工业，已全部实行了公私合营，个体手工纺织业也完成了合作化，并且在合营和合作化以后，生产与经营情况都有了改善和提高。
    纺织工业的发展，不仅供应了人民生活和国家建设的需要，而且为国家积累了资金。在第一个五年计划内，纺织工业上缴给国家的利润共计二十九亿余元，约等于在第一个五年计划内国家对纺织工业部全部投资的百分之二百四十。
    我国纺织工业的发展证明了我国工业化的道路是完全正确的，只有在共产党的领导下，纺织工业才能取得上述巨大的成绩。可见右派分子否定成绩的一切谬论都是没有根据的。
    在前进中发生的问题
    我国纺织工业发展这样快，不可避免地也带来了许多问题，我们在工作中也存在着缺点和错误，这里我想谈两个问题。
    一、纺织原料供应不足，和纺织品的分配计划与生产计划不相适应，是我国当前发展纺织工业的主要矛盾。在第一个五年计划的前四年中，农业生产情况是一年平收，一年丰收，两年歉收。由于原料供应情况不稳定，给纺织工业的发展带来了不少的困难，生产安排、机械制造、基本建设等方面都有很大波动，造成这种情况的原因，除了原料供应不足这一客观因素外，在主观上，对年度计划与远景计划没有做好瞻前顾后的平衡工作，对纺织原料增产可能性的估计，以及对城乡人民的消费水平的估计不尽合适等，也是影响生产安排、机器制造、基本建设等方面平稳进行的因素。
    怎样来解决这些矛盾呢？我认为需要从两个方面努力。
    首先，从原料方面来说，主要的解决办法还需依靠农业增产，同时，积极提高棉花品质，改进轧花工作，也是非常重要的。在原料收购方面，去年的收购率只有百分之七十二点五二，这种情况已经引起有关方面的注意。我还希望能进一步采取若干措施，来保证棉花收购计划的完成，以适应今后进一步发展纺织工业的需要。
    考虑到今后我国人民生活水平逐步提高，棉花资源又有限，在第二个五年计划内，毛、麻、丝等纺织工业和人造纤维工业将有适当的发展，因此，除了棉花以外，国家还必须及早着手增产羊毛、蚕茧以及苎麻等高级纺织原料，目前我国生产需用的细支羊毛仍旧依靠进口，在第二个五年计划内，需要大力改良羊种，提高羊毛质量，使我国细支羊毛的供应能逐步做到自给。蚕茧的产量还不高，质量亦有待进一步改进。据了解蚕茧增产的关键在于育桑工作跟不上，需要积极培育桑林，做到蚕种与桑叶相平衡。同时，改良蚕种，也是一项很重要的工作。我们茧子质量不好的主要原因在于蚕种退化，以致茧子大小不一，茧层厚薄不匀，影响丝的质量，应该力求改进。
    从工业方面来说，几年来在利用现有各种原料资源方面，我们工作中是有许多缺点的，有些应该利用也可以利用的原料，如山羊绒、驼绒、蓖麻蚕茧等，还没有积极地克服技术上的困难设法利用起来，研究工作也进展得比较迟缓，这些都需要在今后几年内积极地、有计划地给以解决。
    解决原料供应不足的矛盾的另一个办法，是发展人造纤维和合成纤维工业。由于我国原来在这一方面没有基础，在设备、技术和生产协作等方面都有许多困难，人造纤维的资源也没有彻底解决，这些都需要在一边学习、一边建设的过程中，逐步加以解决。
    其次，在制订远景计划与年度计划的时候，还必须瞻前顾后地考虑到各个方面的因素，特别是原料方面的因素，尽可能减少和避免计划过多过大的变动。在第一个五年计划内，纺织工业的年度计划是很不平衡的，拿棉纱生产来说，以一九五二年为一百，一九五三年为一百一十三，一九五四年为一百二十七，一九五五年为一百零九，一九五六年为一百四十五。去年我国大部产棉区均遭到了程度不同的水旱灾，棉花歉收，加之一部分棉花收购不上来，因此一九五七年年度计划产量减少了很多，直接影响了织布、印染、针织、复制等工业的生产，对其中比较困难的行业，如手工织布业，在今年安排计划的时候，已作了适当的照顾。几年来，我们执行计划的经验证明，如果不积极主动地研究我国经济生活中的各种规律，就无法区别那些经济现象是暂时性的、个别的，那些又是普遍的和在较长时期内存在的，就不可避免地不能和销售计划或者原料增产计划相衔接，就不能把纺织工业的生产和基本建设建立在积极而又充分可靠的基础上。
    考虑到目前我国农业还比较落后，自然灾害还不能完全避免，农业生产还很不稳定等等情况，因此加强原料的储备，将是实现有计划地发展纺织工业的一个重要工作，如果一九五六年不采取按全部原料安排生产的办法，而是生产减少些，假定说生产四百八十万件棉纱，那么就可以储存一百五十万担棉花，则一九五七年就不致因原料不足在安排生产时发生许多困难。如何认真吸取几年来的经验教训，加强计划的平衡工作，逐步增加必要的原料储备，减少过多过大的变动，从而避免损失，减少浪费，将是今后在纺织工业中贯彻“勤俭建国”方针的一个很重要的方面，必须大力加强和改进这一方面的工作。
    二、在增产节约中一定要切实保证与提高产品质量。
    几年来，纺织工业在开展增产节约运动方面，是有许多经验教训的，一九五五年的增产节约运动，普遍地重视了节约，这是好的，但却部分地忽视了质量，结果有些布的质量下降了，引起消费者的不满。一九五六年根据国务院的指示，我们花了很大的力量来扭转这种情况，产品质量与工程质量一般有了提高。一九五七年的增产节约运动，虽然获得了一定的成绩，但是仍出现了一些值得注意的问题，其中根本的问题是如何正确地处理增产节约与提高产品质量的关系，这也是过去存在、今后仍将存在的一个问题。这个问题，如果不从思想上加以解决，就无法对过去的增产节约运动作出正确的估价，并从中得出经验教训，以正确地指导今后的增产节约运动。
    由于纺织工业的原料供应不充裕，原料费用又占了产品成本的百分之八十左右，因而许多同志把开展增产节约运动的主要注意力，放到节约原料方面，这是很自然的。但另一方面，原料本身的质量好坏，使用是否合理，又直接关系到产品的质量，要提高产品质量，就不能不顾质量地在原料上打主意。
    怎样来解决这个矛盾呢？我认为，处理这个矛盾的原则，必须是在保证质量的基础上节约原料，在不影响质量的前提下，可以节约也应该节约。但是不管采用什么形式，只要在实际效果上降低了质量的作法，都是不对的。
    下面我想谈谈关于纱支改细的问题。作为一个方向来说，按照我国棉花纤维较长、较细等特点，以及人民消费水平将日益提高的趋势，可以逐步地有条件地提高纱支。但在改细的时候，一定要注意到使用单位的实用情况与消费者的需要。今年，在已经或准备改细的纱支中，有些品种，如双股线的卡其、线府绸等原来支纱较粗，现在改细是合理的。但不论对象，不加区别地滥改则是不对的。因为纱支改细以后，用纱虽然减少了，棉布却因此变稀、变薄，强力亦下降了。在今年第一季度改细的棉布中，有一部分强力下降了百分之十以上。这种情况，在棉布供应方面已经造成了某些不良的影响。现在纺织工业部与商业部已经为此发出了联合通知，对改变纱支的有关注意事项作了明确的规定，我们当督促所属企业认真贯彻执行，同时，也希望各位代表能经常给以指导和监督。
    在开展增产节约运动中，要贯彻反对两种偏向的斗争，即既要支持群众的积极性，采纳任何一件有实际价值的建议，同时，也要注意防止任何不顾质量的片面节约的作法，因为纺织品质量的好坏，关系到全国每个人的切身利益，纺织品的质量不好，就会损害消费者的利益，就要引起人民群众的不满，就要造成或者扩大人民内部的矛盾。只有我们从思想上真正认识到了提高产品质量的重要意义，我们才会在实际行动中来贯彻保证产品质量的精神，把增产节约运动健康地开展下去。
    各位代表：右派分子说：“成绩是主要的，缺点是次要的，这是形式主义，是一种教条。”单就纺织工业这一个方面的情况来看，也完全足以驳倒他们这种别有用心的谰言。
    我们的纺织工业能够这样迅速发展，首先由于党的领导正确，同时也说明我们社会主义制度的无比优越，可是右派分子却要反掉共产党，反掉社会主义。右派分子的企图是很明显的，就是要扼杀中国工业化唯一可走的道路，使我们的国家回复到过去半封建半殖民地的地位，好让帝国主义来任意压榨我们，宰割我们，使得广大的人民衣不蔽体，而少数官僚资产阶级冬穿泥裘，夏穿丝绸。这是全国人民和我们纺织工业工作者坚决不能答应的！所以我们同右派分子是势不两立，一定要彻底地把他们打垮。共产党的领导绝对不容削弱，社会主义的道路绝对不容动摇，这是我们国家独立富强、人民自由幸福的根本保证！
