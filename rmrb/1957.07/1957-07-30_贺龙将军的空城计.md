General He Long presented an empty fort, delighting Xiang Ziyun of Yongshun;
He walked right into the trap, unable to escape, his entire army annihilated, gladdening hearts.

It is said that in June 1929, General He Long led the Second Red Army Group to his hometown, Sangzhi, to mobilize the masses, strike down local bullies, distribute land, expand the Red Army, and establish revolutionary base areas, creating a lively atmosphere. The local authorities and the Xiangxi "剿共" (Bandit Suppression) Headquarters hurriedly ordered Xiang Ziyun, the "bandit suppression" commander stationed in Yongshun City, to immediately send troops to suppress them and posted notices everywhere: "Whoever kills He Long will be rewarded with five thousand silver dollars."

Xiang Ziyun did not take these "communist bandits" seriously. He ordered his assistants Zhou Hanzhi, Battalion Commander Xiang Jiexian, and Yongshun County Magistrate Luo Wenshu to lead 500 soldiers to "suppress" them, telling them to capture He Long alive and bring him back to claim the hefty reward.

But little did they know that as soon as Zhou Hanzhi and his gang of bandits arrived at Chixi River southwest of Sangzhi County, before they even saw He Long's shadow, they were ambushed by the Red Army who had been waiting for them. They were utterly defeated with over 300 casualties.

Xiang Ziyun was furious and, after scolding Zhou Hanzhi, immediately telegraphed his superior He Jian, saying, "I will personally lead troops to encircle and suppress Sangzhi from this day forth, vowing to eliminate the communist chieftain and repay the Party-state." He also confidently assured the Xiangxi "剿共" Headquarters, "Have the five thousand silver dollars ready, and I will bring He Long's head to redeem it."

On July 1st, Xiang Ziyun led his entire force, aggressively marching straight towards Sangzhi. A small detachment of the Red Army put up a brief resistance at the Chixi River before retreating. Xiang Ziyun was overjoyed and led his troops in close pursuit. When the Red Army retreated to Sangzhi County, they were outnumbered and outgunned, and instead of entering the city, they continued to "retreat" towards the east of the city.

Xiang Ziyun easily occupied the empty city of Sangzhi. Watching his flag slowly being raised over the city walls, he immediately revealed an arrogant demeanor, instructing his subordinates to report to his superiors, He Jian, and the Xiangxi "Bandit Suppression" Headquarters, that "the 'communist bandits' in the Sangzhi area have been basically eliminated, and we will return in triumph soon."

Xiang Ziyun was complacent, unaware that he had become a caged bird, trapped in the dragnet set up for him by General He Long.

It turned out that Sangzhi City was strategically located, with water on one side and mountains on three sides. Once the enemy had all entered the empty city, General He Long gave the order, and the red flags on all the hilltops were unfurled. The red flags led the Red Army, sweeping down towards the county seat from all directions. Immediately, the sounds of gunfire and battle cries resounded through the clouds. The enemy didn't even know what was happening! General He Long, holding a Browning pistol, led a team of Red Army soldiers to charge into the city from the north gate first, while the Red Army from the east and west gates also followed closely behind. The enemy was panicked and hastily fought back. In the close-quarters combat, the Red Army was particularly energetic. The flashing of blades and the flying of bullets were all that could be seen. The enemy was in complete disarray, abandoning artillery carts and ammunition scattered all over the streets, and among the countless runaway mules and horses, they fled in all directions, colliding with each other, trampling many to death. Many enemy soldiers simply threw down their weapons and knelt down to surrender.

In less than an afternoon, the majority of the enemy had been wiped out. Xiang Ziyun gathered his remaining troops and attempted to break through the south gate, heading straight for the Chixi River, attempting to cross and escape. The Red Army pursued the fleeing enemy.

Strangely, after the Red Army chased the enemy out of Sangzhi City, torrential rain suddenly poured down from the sky, and the sky grew darker and darker. The enemy was unfamiliar with the roads and paths, and some fell into ditches, while others fell into ponds. Later, the Red Army found many guns and drowned enemy soldiers in a large, water-filled pit in the fields.

At that time, Xiang Ziyun finally managed to reach the Chixi River, looking back at his scattered and demoralized remnants. Before him, the rushing floodwaters roared like ten thousand horses galloping, and in the dark, heavy rain, not a single ferry boat could be seen. At this moment, a Red Army unit, who had been waiting on the riverbank, suddenly appeared as if descending from the heavens and launched another surprise attack on the enemy. The small group of enemy soldiers could not withstand this attack and, pushing and shoving in a chaotic mass, shouting for their parents and falling into the water, they surrendered one after another. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Xiang Ziyun suddenly leaped onto his horse and whipped its rear. The startled horse reared up and jumped into the Chixi River. At this moment, the roar of the river grew even louder, and the waves rose even higher. Xiang Ziyun was tossed up and down by the waves, and in a flash of lightning, he was swept away by a giant wave and disappeared without a trace.

The battle ended there. Since then, the folk song at the beginning of this article has been circulating in the Sangzhi and Yongshun areas of Hunan, and it has been popular for more than thirty years.

    贺龙将军的空城计
    赵清学  张启正
    贺龙将军献空城，喜煞永顺向子云；
    自投罗网逃不脱，全军复没快人心。
    话说1929年6月间，贺龙将军带领红二军团来到他的家乡——桑植一带，发动群众，打土豪，分田地，扩大红军，建立革命根据地，闹得热火朝天。当地当权派和湘西“剿共”司令部慌忙命令驻永顺城“防匪”司令向子云马上出兵进剿，还到处粘贴告示：杀死贺龙者，赏光洋五千元。
    向子云不把这点“共匪”放在眼下。他命令他的助手周寒之、营长向捷先和永顺县县长罗文述领兵五百前往“讨伐”，叫他们捉个“活”的贺龙回去领重赏。
    那知道，周寒之一帮匪徒们刚到桑植县西南的赤溪河，连贺龙的影子还没有看见，就被早已等着的红军打得落花流水，死伤三百多人，大败而归。
    向子云气得暴跳如雷，怒骂周寒之一阵后，立即向上司何键打电报说：“即日亲赴桑植围剿，誓灭共魁，以报党国。”又向湘西“剿共”司令部拍胸脯说：“五千元光洋给我准备好，我就拿贺龙的首级来兑现。”
    7月1日，向子云带领他的全部人马，气势凶凶地直扑桑植而来。一小支红军在赤溪河畔阻击了一阵，不支而退。向子云大喜，率部紧紧追杀。红军撤退到桑植县城时，人少势薄，连城也没进，就继续向城东“败退”。
    向子云顺手占领了桑植这座空城，眼看着他的旗帜徐徐升到城头上，立时露出不可一世的气概，吩咐部下分别向上级何键和湘西“剿匪”司令部报捷：“桑植一带‘共匪’已基本肃清，不日即可凯旋归去。”
    向子云踌躇满志，那料想已成笼中鸟，陷在贺龙将军给他布置好的天罗地网中了。
    原来这桑植城地势险要，一面靠水，三面环山。等敌人全部进了空城，贺龙将军一声令下，各山头上的红旗都扯起来了。红旗带着红军，满山遍野冲向县城。顿时，枪声、喊杀声，响彻云霄，敌人还不知是怎么回事哩！贺龙将军手持卜克枪，率领一队红军先从北门杀进城来，东西两门的红军也紧跟着杀进了城内。敌人惊慌失措，仓惶应战。短兵相接，红军格外有劲。只见刀光闪闪，枪弹纷飞。敌人混乱不堪，丢下满街东倒西歪的炮车、弹药，夹在无数乱跑乱踢的骡马群中四散逃窜，自相撞倒踏死了不少，还有不少敌兵把枪一摔，跪下投降。
    不到一个下午，敌人被歼大半。向子云集合残部，向南门突围，直奔赤溪河，企图抢渡逃命。红军乘胜追击。
    说也怪，当红军把敌人追出桑植城后，天空突然降下倾盆大雨，天色也越来越黑。敌人不熟悉此地道路，有的摔到沟里，有的掉进池塘里。后来红军在田里一个积满了水的大深坑里，捞出了很多枪枝和淹死的敌兵。
    当时向子云好不容易跑到了赤溪河边，回顾身边残兵败将，七零八落，溃不成军。面前滚滚洪水，像万马奔腾般咆哮着，天黑雨大，一只渡船也不见。正在这时，早已候在河畔的一支红军，好像天兵下降似的，向敌人又来了个突然冲杀。一小撮敌人那里还经得起这一着，你推我挤乱作一团，喊爹唤妈跌地落水，纷纷投了降。向子云一看形势不对，猛地翻身上马，连抽几鞭马屁股。那失惊的马跃起前腿，跳进了赤溪河。这时河水吼声更大，浪头更高。向子云被大浪翻上翻下，在闪电的刹那，被一个巨浪卷得无影无踪了。
    这一仗，就此结束。自此以后，湖南桑植、永顺一带，就流传开了开头这首民谣，至今三十来年，盛传不衰。
