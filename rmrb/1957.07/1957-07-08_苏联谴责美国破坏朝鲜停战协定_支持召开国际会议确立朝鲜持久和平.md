Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 6th (TASS): The Soviet government issued the following statement regarding the United States undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement:

Thanks to the efforts of peace-loving people of all countries, the Korean War ended in 1953, and the Armistice Agreement was signed, which was a major contribution to easing international tensions in the Far East and the world. With the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, a dangerous source of war in the Far East was eliminated, opening up prospects for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

According to the Armistice Agreement (which stipulates the obligations of the signatory states to maintain peace in Korea), both sides should cease the introduction of reinforcing troops into Korea, including all kinds of new weapons. To ensure the supervision of the observance of these provisions, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission was established, which assumed an important function in maintaining peace in Korea.

As everyone knows, in order to strive for the transformation of the Korean Armistice into a lasting peace and to create conditions for the peaceful reunification of Korea, the Korean-Chinese side has always strictly abided by the various provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and has often striven to resolve the problems arising in the implementation of the Armistice Agreement through negotiations. In this regard, the fact that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reduced the number of its troops in 1956 and that several divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea can be pointed out.

The US military authorities, however, have adopted a different attitude in fulfilling their obligations under the Korean Armistice Agreement, consistently pursuing a policy of undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement. As everyone knows, last year, the United States tried to make its violation of the agreement free from international supervision, unilaterally stopped the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in South Korea, while rudely ignoring the legitimate protests of the Korean-Chinese side.

It is understandable that these blatant violations of the Armistice Agreement have absolutely no benefit to the improvement of the Korean situation. The statement issued on June 21st by the United States Forces Korea Command through their representatives in the Korean Military Armistice Commission that it considers itself not bound by the provisions of Article II, Paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement regarding the prohibition of bringing new weapons into Korea further complicates the situation.

At the same time as this statement, the US Department of Defense also issued a communiqué stating that the United States has decided to immediately send "modernized armaments" to South Korea, including fighter jets, bombers capable of carrying atomic weapons, tanks, and other weapons. A spokesman for the US Department of Defense also said that US forces in South Korea will be equipped with atomic weapons.

The United States' failure to comply with the most important provision of the Armistice Agreement regarding the prohibition of bringing weapons into Korea further exposes the purpose of the US ruling clique – to obstruct the easing of international tensions in the Far East and to implement plans to establish US atomic forces in this region, which in itself further complicates the situation, thereby greatly strengthening the threat to the cause of peace in the Far East. The US ruling clique maintains the tense situation in Korea, relying on the aggressive provocateurs of the South Korean regime, and strives to continue the de facto occupation of South Korea by US armed forces, thereby constantly threatening the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with aggression.

In order to cover up its refusal to comply with the international obligations clearly stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement, the US side insists that the Korean-Chinese side has violated the Armistice Agreement, although this claim has been refuted by the facts themselves.

It is not difficult to imagine what the situation would be like if the Korean-Chinese side also began to transport all kinds of new weapons into North Korea, including aircraft capable of carrying the latest weapons, and equipped the army with these weapons. Undoubtedly, the result would be a situation with very dangerous consequences.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of the People's Republic of China have lodged strong protests against the illegal actions of the US armed forces in violating the Armistice Agreement, demanding that the United States strictly abide by the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and proposing that an international conference be held with the participation of all relevant countries to establish lasting peace in Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

The Soviet government believes it is necessary to state that it fully supports the attitude expressed by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government

### 苏联谴责美国破坏朝鲜停战协定  支持召开国际会议确立朝鲜持久和平

    苏联谴责美国破坏朝鲜停战协定
    支持召开国际会议确立朝鲜持久和平
    新华社7日讯  塔斯社莫斯科6日讯：苏联政府就美国破坏朝鲜停战协定条款发表声明如下：
    由于各国爱好和平人民的努力，朝鲜战争在1953年停止了，并且签订了停战协定，这是对缓和远东和全世界国际紧张局势的一个重大贡献。随着朝鲜停战协定的签订，远东的危险的战争策源地被消灭，从而开辟了和平解决朝鲜问题的前景。
    根据停战协定（其中规定了缔约国对维持朝鲜和平的义务），双方应该停止向朝鲜调入增援部队，包括各种新武器。为了保证监督这些条款得到遵守，建立了中立国监察委员会，这个委员会担负了维持朝鲜和平的重要职能。
    大家知道，朝中方面为了力求使朝鲜停战转为持久和平并且为和平统一朝鲜创造条件，始终严格遵守停战协定的各项条款，并且经常力求用谈判的方式解决在执行停战协定过程中所发生的问题。在这方面可以指出1956年朝鲜民主主义人民共和国裁减军队人数和中国人民志愿军好几个师从朝鲜民主主义人民共和国撤出的事实。
    美国军事当局在执行它在朝鲜停战协定的义务方面却采取另外一种态度，一贯施行破坏朝鲜停战协定的政策。大家知道，去年，美国力图使自己破坏协定的行为不受国际的监督，片面地在南朝鲜停止中立国监察委员会的工作，同时粗暴地无视朝中方面合法的抗议。
    可以理解，这些公然破坏停战协定的行为，对于朝鲜局势的改善绝对没有好处。美国驻朝鲜部队司令部今年6月21日通过它们在朝鲜军事停战委员会中的代表声明，它认为自己不受停战协定第二条第十三款卯项关于禁止把新武器运进朝鲜的规定的约束，这样就使得局势更为复杂。
    在这个声明的同时，美国国防部还发表公报说，美国决定把美国的“现代化军备”，其中包括歼击机、能够装载原子武器的轰炸机、坦克和其他武器立即送到南朝鲜。美国国防部的发言人还说，美国驻南朝鲜部队将得到原子武器的装备。
    美国不遵守停战协定关于禁止把武器运入朝鲜的最重要的条款，更加暴露了美国统治集团的目的——阻挠缓和远东的国际紧张局势，在这一地区实现建立美国原子部队的计划，这本身就使得局势更加复杂起来，从而大大加强了对远东和平事业的威胁。美国统治集团维持着朝鲜的紧张局势，依靠南朝鲜政权的侵略挑拨分子，力图使美国武装力量实际上继续占领南朝鲜，从而使朝鲜民主主义人民共和国经常受到侵略的威胁。
    美国方面拒绝遵守朝鲜停战协定上明文规定的国际义务，为了替自己掩饰，硬说朝中方面破坏停战协定，虽然这种说法遭到了事实本身的驳斥。
    不难想像，假如朝中方面也开始往北朝鲜运入各式各样的新武器，包括诸如能够载运最新式武器的飞机在内，并且用这些武器装备军队，那么，情况将会演变成什么样子。无疑，结果将会造成具有非常危险后果的局面。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府已经对美国武装力量破坏停战协定的非法行动提出了坚决的抗议，要求美国严格地遵守朝鲜停战协定的条款，并且建议召开由一切有关国家参加的国际会议，以求确立朝鲜的持久和平和和平解决朝鲜问题。
    苏联政府认为有必要声明，它完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府在上述声明中所表明的态度。
    美国武装力量破坏朝鲜停战协定，以及把南朝鲜变为美国在远东的原子基地之一的挑衅行动，公然违反各国人民要求加强国与国之间信任和巩固亚洲及全世界和平的共同愿望。苏联政府注意到美国方面破坏朝鲜停战协定的非法行动，认为必须声明，这些行动的后果完全由美国负责。
