    A Shoulder-Pole Puppet Showman Speaks Out
    Yan Fengwu

    Rightist elements, taking advantage of the Communist Party's rectification campaign, are launching attacks on the Party using all sorts of shameless means. They talk about a "Party-controlled world," "a decline in people's living standards," and "only those who used to wear torn shoes but now ride in small cars and wear woolen uniforms have improved their lives," and other such fallacies. This is extremely infuriating.

    We should carefully examine whether living standards have improved after liberation. Facts speak louder than words, so let's just use the real situation of us folk puppet showmen to make a comparison!

    I am a shoulder-pole puppet showman who suffered oppression and discrimination in the old society. After liberation, I was emancipated and invited to be an actor in the National Puppet Theater. In the old society, my family had been performing shoulder-pole puppet shows for three generations. Life was always without support. When the Japanese devils were here, we ate mixed flour; we wore rags bought from the small market; when we were sick, we didn't have money to see a doctor and had to wait to die. If we died, we didn't have money for burial. There's a saying among our peers: "Wherever we die, we're buried there, a dog's belly is the coffin."

    In the 1945s, the Japanese devils surrendered, and we thought our lives could be improved. Who knew the Kuomintang came along, and their oppression of us poor people was the same as the Japanese devils, making life even more miserable and difficult for those in our profession. The money earned by a family in a day was not enough for one person. Kuomintang currency changed a thousand times a day. Millet flour rose three times a day. In the morning, it was 12,000 yuan a catty, 20,000 yuan at noon, and 28,000 yuan in the evening. This kind of situation simply made it impossible for us to survive. Isn't this dark and hopeless government the one that the rightist elements yearn for?

    In 1948, my family of eight couldn't survive in Beijing. So we returned to our home in the countryside. At that time, our hometown was an old liberated area, and the people's lives were very good. Only the landlords who had been struggled against were subject to the people's control. The landlords' lives were certainly lowered, because they could no longer ride on the heads of the people, acting like tyrants and oppressing the poor working people. From this time on, the dark and hopeless, gloomy and foggy days of the laboring people, and as the rightist elements say, the days full of darkness, passed. The people's lives have been improved, with fundamental changes from the past.

    After liberation, our lives are happy and fulfilling.

    I, this tramp who was not valued, had no culture, no status, and no home in the old society, am now cared for, and have also greatly improved politically and culturally. I have a wife and daughter, and I am reunited with my father, mother, brother, and sisters. Now our family of eight has support.

    We have received the Party's meticulous care. In 1955, my old father was ill. In the old society, he would have to wait to die; now we are not troubled. Medical expenses and hospitalization fees are all subsidized by the Party at the higher level. The Party always promptly solves whatever difficulties our family has.

    Those people with ulterior motives are using all kinds of tricks to sabotage our socialist construction and want to get rid of the Party's leadership. They spread rumors about the Party in all aspects and stir up trouble. However, the laboring people are determined to listen to Chairman Mao and follow the Communist Party. Without the Communist Party, there would be no happy life for the laboring people; without the Communist Party, there would be no happiness for us today. Rightist elements, open your eyes and see! Have our lives been lowered or improved?

    一个肩担戏艺人的话
    阎凤舞
    右派分子借着共产党整风的机会，用各种无耻的手段向党进攻。讲什么“党天下”、“人民生活降低了”、“只有过去穿破鞋现在坐小卧车穿呢子制服的人们生活提高了”等等谬论。这是使人非常愤慨的。
    我们应当仔细看看解放后生活是否提高了。事实胜雄辩，就只用我们民间木偶戏艺人的实事来对照一下吧！
    我是一个在旧社会受压迫受歧视的肩担戏艺人，解放后我得到了翻身，被邀请为国家木偶剧团的演员。在旧社会，我的家庭演肩担戏已经三代了。生活总是无依靠的，鬼子在的时候，我们吃的是混合面；穿的是从小市上买来的破烂；生病时没有看病的钱，只得挨着等死。要是死了也没有钱葬埋。我们同行有句话说：“那里死了那里埋，狗肚子就是棺材”。
    1945的年代里，日本鬼子投降了，我们想生活满可以改良，那知道国民党跟着来了，对我们穷人的压迫和日本鬼子一样，害得我们这行人的生活更惨更难了。一家一天所挣的钱，不够一个人的用。国民党的票纸，一日千变。小米面一天三涨。早晨起来一万二千元一斤、中午两万、晚上就两万八千元。这种情景简直叫我们难再生存。像这样暗无天日的政府，不正是右派分子所向往的政府吗？
    1948年我们一家八口在北京就无法生活了。所以回了乡下的家，那时我们的家乡是老解放区了，人民生活是很好的。只有被斗后的地主受着人民的管制。地主的生活当然是降低了，因为他们不能再骑在人民的头上作威作福的欺压贫困的劳动人民了。从这时起，劳动人民那暗无天日的阴愁多雾的、也正如右派分子所说到处是黑暗的日子过去了。人民的生活得到了提高，有了根本与过去不同的变化。
    解放后我们的生活是幸福的美满的。
    我这个在旧社会里不被重视、没有文化、没有地位、无家可归的流浪汉有了人管，在政治和文化上也有了很大的提高。我有了爱人和女儿，并和父亲母亲弟弟妹妹欢聚一堂。现在我们的八口之家生活有了依靠。
    我们得到了党的无微不至的照顾。1955年我的老父亲有病，在旧社会，就得挨着等死；现在我们就不为难了。医药费和住院费都是上级党给予的补助。我们家无论是那方面的困难党都是及时的给解决。
    那些别有用心的人们，从各方面巧用心机，想破坏我们的社会主义建设，不要党的领导，就在各方面造党的谣言，搬弄是非。然而，劳苦的人民是坚决听毛主席的话跟共产党走的。没有共产党就没有劳苦人民的幸福生活；没有共产党更没有我们幸福的今天。右派分子睁大眼睛看看吧！我们的生活是降低还是提高呢？
