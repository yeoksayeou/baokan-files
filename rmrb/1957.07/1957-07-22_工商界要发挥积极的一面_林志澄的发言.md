I agree with and support the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li and Bo, Vice Chairman Peng, President Dong, and Prosecutor-General Zhang, and I suggest that the congress approve them.

Resolutely Repulse the Rightists' Fallacies

The Chinese Communist Party's leadership of the Chinese people in building socialism embodies the highest interests of the Chinese people and has achieved brilliant successes. However, bourgeois rightists not only deny the brilliant achievements of our socialist construction but also issue absurd statements against the Communist Party, against socialism, and against the people's democratic dictatorship, attempting to drag our country back into the capitalist mire. For example, the bourgeois rightist Zhang Naiqi attempted to use absurd statements to exploit the negative aspects of the industrial and commercial sector to mislead them. He issued fallacies such as the bourgeoisie no longer having two sides, bourgeois elements and working-class elements no longer having essential differences, fixed interest not being exploitation but unearned income, and bureaucracy being a more dangerous enemy than capitalism. Our industrial and commercial sector must give play to its positive side and sternly refute these fallacies.

I believe that the bourgeoisie's means of production were accumulated through exploitation. The working class adopted a policy of redemption to peacefully transform our bourgeoisie. When we hand over the means of production to the people, the state also gives us many considerations and leads us along with the people of the whole country to a socialist society where generations can be wealthy. The state has taken such a responsible attitude, which is redemption to the end and the utmost benevolence! To regard redemption as a transaction and demand equivalent exchange is a very insatiable delusion and an exposure of the bourgeoisie's nature of pursuing profit and being greedy.

It is absolutely necessary to have public representatives in joint ventures. Demanding the abolition of this system would not be "joint public-private ownership," would not guarantee the Party's leadership, would not guarantee that the enterprise moves forward in the socialist direction, and would not coordinate labor-private relations, enhance unity, and improve production. For us private personnel, we would lack good teachers and helpful friends who can help us transform ourselves most regularly and specifically. Some public representatives have bad work styles, which is a fact, but it is not a problem of the entire system. A person's work style can be changed. It is unreasonable to demand the abolition of this system because of the bad work style of a few individuals. Some private personnel also have shortcomings. If someone were to demand the withdrawal of private personnel because of this, how would our industrial and commercial sector react? The proposal to withdraw public representatives is a blatant manifestation of refusing transformation.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution, and are now carrying out large-scale economic and cultural construction. Years of real-life experience have made us deeply realize that the socialist road is indeed the only way out for our nation, and the Chinese Communist Party is indeed wise, great, and correct. We industrialists, businessmen, and members of the China Democratic National Construction Association must not be misled by the rightists' fallacies. We must draw a clear line with them, resolutely counter their attacks on the Party and socialism! Under the leadership of the Party, we will continue to accept transformation and take the socialist road!

Arrangement Issues for Wholesalers and Transferred Personnel

In the private sector reform in Guangzhou, there is one issue that has not been completely resolved, namely the arrangement of wholesalers and transferred personnel. I hereby request the Central Committee to study and handle this.

Since the high tide of joint ventures, private personnel have generally received appropriate arrangements and their enthusiasm has been brought into play. However, the arrangements for individual personnel, especially some wholesalers and transferred personnel (including both labor and private parties), still have problems. Many of them have been engaged in commercial work for many years and have certain trade experience and specialized knowledge of certain commodities. They were transferred or closed down their businesses before the high tide of joint ventures and accepted arrangements. However, at that time, some of our leading departments did not arrange some of them in positions where they could best play their roles based on their experience and expertise. For example, an old expert who had been in the medicinal materials business for decades and had experience in identifying the authenticity and quality of medicinal materials and in storing and sorting medicinal materials was arranged to sell salted fish; some were arranged in industries they were familiar with, but only did general odd jobs, and their experience and expertise were not used or respected; and so on. This not only makes these old experts feel that they have "no place to use their talents," but also a loss to the country. At present, some state-owned and joint-venture businesses lack business personnel. Therefore, doing a good job in the arrangement work is beneficial to bringing their expertise and enthusiasm into play and to enriching the business strength of state-owned and joint-venture enterprises. Of course, on the other hand, our All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association must also strengthen ideological education for them.

Improve Guangzhou's Municipal Construction

Secondly, there are also problems in Guangzhou's public utilities and supply of raw materials, and many citizens of Guangzhou have opinions. I now also request the Central Committee to study and handle them.

Guangzhou is the southern gateway of the motherland, adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau, and is a city that was liberated later and originally had a relatively backward industrial production. The problems left over from the old society are also more prominent than in other cities, and overseas Chinese and international visitors come and go frequently, so doing a good job in Guangzhou's municipal construction is of great significance for developing production and for international perception.

1.  Electricity Equipment Issues: At present, Guangzhou's power supply capacity is far behind the needs of industrial production. Last year, it was estimated that the daily power shortage was about 19,000 kilowatts, and factories are increasing construction, expansion, and production, and the demand for power supply continues to increase. Over the past year, a series of measures have been taken, such as the city's factories implementing a rotational holiday system according to routes, or a late-night shift system; strengthening publicity and mobilizing government agencies and citizens to save and restrict lighting electricity, etc. These measures are effective, but it is still impossible to completely eliminate the long-term shortage of electricity. The Central Committee has now allocated an additional motor, which is expected to increase the power supply by 12,500 kilowatts, which is a powerful support for us. However, due to the postponement of the power generation time of the Liuxi River Hydropower Station and the reduction in power generation, it is estimated that Guangzhou still lacks a lot of electricity. Therefore, I hope that the Central Committee can quickly allocate the 10,000-kilowatt thermal power equipment that the State Council approved last year, so that Guangzhou's power supply problem can be fundamentally solved.

2.  Tap Water Supply Issues: Since liberation, Guangzhou's population has been growing continuously, and the number of water users in 1956 increased by about 50% compared to 1952. The original tap water equipment has long been unable to meet the demand. In addition, after the opening of Huangpu Outer Port, foreign ships come and go frequently, and the population of the port has also increased rapidly, so that shipping and residents' drinking water have not been resolved. Ocean-going vessels have to detour to other places to get drinking water, which has a bad impact. The Central Committee has designated that the Huangpu Port water supply problem must be solved this year, which is correct and necessary. However, there is still a large difference in the raw materials needed to increase the water supply, and I ask the Central Committee to help solve it.

3.  Telephone Equipment Issues: Guangzhou is to expand 4,000 telephone lines, and most of the machines ordered from Hungary have been shipped. These machines are very difficult to store in warehouses because they need to protect the insulation performance and avoid moisture. However, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications only approved an investment of 1 million yuan this year, which cannot even complete the project of opening 2,000 telephone lines (the budget is about 2.8 million yuan), so that all the new machines are shelved and cannot be put into production.

4.  Raw Material Supply Issues for Certain Factories: There is still a large difference in the supply of certain raw materials in Guangzhou. For example, no tinplate was allocated by the central government in the second quarter, and only 3.5% of the required amount of black iron sheet was allocated, which affected the production of 66 factories with about 10,500 employees; Guangdong is a sugar-producing area, but the province's allocation of orange juice to the city only meets 11% of the city's supply; also, the raw materials of some factories (such as Guangzhou Wire Factory) are mostly unified allocation materials, which are allocated by the central government, but they are not timely and uneven. Often, the needs of one raw material for two quarters or even the whole year arrive first, while another raw material only arrives in some quantities or even does not arrive at all, causing production difficulties.

5.  Rational Use of Construction Funds and Rational Allocation of Human Resources: A certain shipyard in Guangzhou directly under the Central Committee has not yet officially started production, but has already recruited a large number of Shanghai workers. In order to solve their housing problem, more than a dozen three-story dormitories have been built. In fact, according to the factory's tasks, Guangdong has a lot of technical strength that can be used, and many of the personnel recruited from Shanghai are young apprentices, which can also be solved near Guangzhou. The factory's approach has caused a lot of waste. The same situation of inappropriately calling a large number of workers from other provinces exists in a certain state-owned rubber factory in Guangzhou, and attention should be paid to correcting it in the future.

I believe that the arrangement of funds and the allocation of materials should of course have priorities, but I also hope that the Central Committee will gain a detailed and in-depth understanding of the situation based on the principle of overall planning and appropriate arrangements for local construction and production issues, rationally adjust the plan, appropriately balance it, and give the local necessary support, so as to avoid some projects being shelved halfway, backloging and wasting funds, and causing losses to the country.

### 工商界要发挥积极的一面  林志澄的发言

    工商界要发挥积极的一面
    林志澄的发言
    我同意和拥护周总理、李、薄副总理、彭副委员长、董院长和张检察长的报告，并建议大会予以通过。
    坚决回击右派的谬论
    中国共产党领导中国人民建设社会主义，体现了中国人民的最高利益，取得了辉煌的成就。但是资产阶级右派分子不独抹煞我们社会主义建设的辉煌成就，而且发出反对共产党、反对社会主义、反对人民民主专政的荒谬言论，企图把我们国家拉回到资本主义的泥坑里去。例如资产阶级右派分子章乃器就企图以荒谬言论利用工商界消极的一面来迷惑工商界。他发表了资产阶级已经没有两面性，资产阶级分子和工人阶级分子已经没有本质的差别，定息不是剥削而是不劳而获，官僚主义是比资本主义更加危险的敌人等等谬论。我们工商界必须发挥积极的一面，对这些谬论加以严正的驳斥。
    我认为，资产阶级的生产资料是通过剥削积累起来的。工人阶级为了和平改造我们资产阶级，采取了赎买的政策。当我们将生产资料交回给人民的时候，国家还给我们多方面的照顾，并且还带引我们同全国人民一道走向子孙万代世世富裕的社会主义社会。国家采取了这样负责的态度，就是赎买到底了，仁至义尽了！把赎买看成买卖，索取等价交换是很不知足的妄想，是资产阶级唯利是图、贪得无厌的本质的暴露。
    合营企业中设公方代表是完全必要的。要求废除这个制度就不成其为“公私合营”，就不能保证党的领导，就不能保证企业按照社会主义的方向前进，就不能协调劳私关系，增进团结，搞好生产；而对我们私方人员来说，就缺少了能够最经常地具体地帮助我们改造的良师益友。有些公方代表作风不好，这是事实，但不是整个制度问题。人的作风不好可以改变。由于个别人作风不好，就要求取消这个制度，是不合理的。有些私方人员也有缺点，试问如果有人因此要求撤出私方人员，我们工商界又会怎样讲呢？撤出公方代表的主张，是拒绝改造的露骨表现。
    我国人民在中国共产党领导下，取得了民主主义革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利，现在又进行着大规模的经济文化建设。多年来现实生活的体验，使我们深深体会到：社会主义道路确实是我国民族的唯一出路；中国共产党确实是英明、伟大和正确的。我们工商业者和民建成员，决不要为右派分子的谬论迷惑，我们要和他们划清界线，坚决回击他们对党、对社会主义的进攻！在党的领导下，继续接受改造，走社会主义的道路！
    批发商和转业户人员的安排问题
    广州市私改问题中，有一个问题，尚未得到完满解决，那就是批发商和转业户人员的安排问题。现谨提请中央研究处理。
    合营高潮以来，私方人员一般都获得了适当的安排，积极性也得到了发挥；但对个别人员特别是某些批发商和转业户的人员（包括劳私双方）的安排仍是存着问题的。他们当中不少人从事商业工作多年，有一定的贸易工作经验和对某些商品的专门知识。他们是在合营高潮前转业或歇业接受安排的。但当时我们某些领导部门，对其中某些人没有根据其经验专长把他们安排到最能够发挥作用的职位上去。例如：有个经营药材数十年，对识别药材的真伪优劣，对保管整理药材有经验的老行尊曾被安排卖咸鱼去了；有些虽安排在他熟识的行业，但只做一般勤杂工作，对其经验专长没有使用和尊重；等等。这样就不仅这些老行尊有“英雄无用武之地”之感，而对国家来说也是一种损失。目前某些国营和合营商业就有业务人员缺乏的情况。所以做好安排工作，对发挥他们的专长和积极性，对充实国营和合营企业的业务力量是有好处的。当然，另方面，我们工商联和民建会也要对他们加强思想教育工作。
    搞好广州的市政建设
    其次，广州市的公用事业及生产原料供应方面也存在问题，广州市民有不少意见，现在也同时提请中央研究处理。
    广州市是祖国的南大门，地邻港澳，又是解放较迟、原来工业生产较落后的一个城市。旧社会遗留下来的问题也比其他城市更觉突出，而侨胞和国际人士进出频繁，所以搞好广州市的市政建设对发展生产、对国际观感都有重要意义。
    一、电力设备问题——目前广州市供电能力大大落后于工业生产的需要，去年估计每日短给量约为一万九千瓩，而工厂增建、扩建、增产，对供电量的需求又续有增加。一年来，已采取了一系列的措施，如全市工厂按照路线实行轮休制，或深夜倒班制；加强宣传，动员机关、市民节约和限制照明用电等。这些措施是有效的，但还不可能彻底解除长期电力不足的紧张状态。现中央已增拨电机一部，预计可增加电力供应一万二千五百瓩，这对我们是一个有力的支援。但由于流溪河水电站发电的时间要推迟，发电量也减少，估计广州市电量尚缺很多。因此，希望中央能将国务院去年已批准的一万瓩火力发电设备迅速下拨，使广州市供电问题得到基本解决。
    二、自来水供应问题——解放以来，广州市人口不断增长，用水人数一九五六年比一九五二年增加了约百分之五十。原有自来水设备早已供不应求，加以开辟黄埔外港之后，外轮进出频繁，该港人口也迅速增加，以致航运和居民食水，至今无法解决。远洋航轮须绕到别处取给食水，影响不佳。中央对黄埔港供水问题，指定必须今年解决，这是正确和必要的。可是增加供水所必需的原料差额尚多，请中央协助解决。
    三、电话设备问题——广州市要扩建四千门电话，向匈牙利订购的机器，绝大部分已运到。这些机器，因要保护绝缘性能，避免潮湿，堆存仓库问题极难解决。但邮电部今年只批准投资一百万元，这连开放二千门电话的工程也不能完成（预算约需二百八十万元），使全部新机搁置不能投入生产。
    四、某些工厂原料供应问题——广州市某些原料供应差额尚大。例如：第二季度马口铁中央全无分配，黑铁皮只分配了需要量的百分之三点五，影响到六十六个厂，职工约一万零五百人的生产问题；广东是产糖区，但省分配给市的桔水，全市供应量仅及需要百分之十一；又如有些厂（如广州电线厂）的原料绝大部分是统配物资，由中央调拨，但不及时、不均衡，往往一种原料两个季度甚至全年的需要量都先到了，而另一种原料却只到了一些甚至完全没有到，致生产发生困难。
    五、建设资金合理使用和人力合理调配问题——广州直属中央的某造船厂，目前还没有正式开工生产，却已招用了大批上海工人。为了解决他们的居住问题，盖了十余座三层的宿舍。其实，按照该厂的任务来说，广东有很多技术力量可以调用，而从上海招来的人员中还有不少是青年学徒，这也是可以就近在广州解决的。该厂的做法，造成了许多浪费。像这样不恰当地大量调用外省工人的情况，广州国营某胶厂同样存在，今后应注意改正。
    我认为资金的安排，物资的调配，当然应该有主次缓急之分，但也希望中央对地方上的建设及生产问题，根据统筹兼顾，适当安排的方针，细致地深入地了解情况，合理地调整计划，适当地平衡一下，给地方上必要的支持，免使有些工程半途搁置，积压和浪费资金，招致国家的损失。
