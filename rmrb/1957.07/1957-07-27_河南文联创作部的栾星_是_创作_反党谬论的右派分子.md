Luan Xing of the Henan Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Creative Department
Is a Rightist Who "Created" Anti-Party Fallacies

(Our Dispatch) In the anti-rightist struggle, the Henan Federation of Literary and Art Circles exposed a series of reactionary statements by Luan Xing (Communist Party member), the person in charge of the federation's creative department and a rightist.

At a symposium convened by the Provincial Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education, Luan Xing, under the guise of opposing dogmatism, viciously vilified Marxism-Leninism as "official learning," making reactionary remarks against using Marxism-Leninism as the guiding ideology of the Party. Luan Xing said: "The three characteristics of dogmatism are: the 'turban air' of scholastic philosophy; the 'yamen tone' of relying on official power; and the 'hatchet man appearance' of wielding a battle-axe." He also negated the enormous development of ideological work in recent years, saying: "One of the reasons for the ideological stagnation in recent years lies here."

Luan Xing also arrogantly discussed his so-called "four ideological differences with the Party." Comrades from the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles pointed out during the debate that the basic idea behind Luan Xing's so-called "four instances of disagreement" was that "the Party does not understand literature and art," attempting to use this to completely negate the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work, thereby allowing his bourgeois literary and artistic ideas to spread without restraint.

At a meeting of the Federation's staff, Luan Xing said, "The editor's note to the People's Daily's publication of the three batches of materials on the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique has a dark side and side effects." Some comrades revealed that Luan Xing's counter-revolutionary remarks did not originate today; as early as last year, he had raised the question of "whether the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique case is a large 'literary inquisition'." During this round of airing opinions, he elaborated on the "literary inquisition" with some malicious intent, saying: "Today's proletarian dictatorship and the ideological rule of Marxism are even more ferocious and severe than the 'literary inquisition' of the Qing Dynasty."

Currently, the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles will further refute the statements of the rightist Luan Xing, launch a reasoned struggle, and the movement is developing in depth.

### 河南文联创作部的栾星  是“创作”反党谬论的右派分子

    河南文联创作部的栾星
    是“创作”反党谬论的右派分子
    本报讯　河南省文学艺术工作者联合会在反右派斗争中，揭发了该会创作部负责人、右派分子栾星（共产党员）一系列的反动言行。
    栾星在省委文教部召开的座谈会上假借反教条主义名义恶毒地诬蔑马克思列宁主义为“官学”，反对以马克思列宁主义作为党的指导思想的反动言论。栾星说：“教条主义的三个特色是：繁琐哲学的‘头巾气’；托官依势的‘衙门腔’；抡班斧的‘打手相’”。他还否定几年来思想工作的巨大发展，说：“几年来思想呆滞原因之一，是在这里。”
    栾星还狂妄地谈了他的所谓“与党的四次思想分歧”。省文联同志在辩论会上批判时指出，栾星所谓“四不服气”，其基本思想是认为“党不懂文艺”，企图借此把党对文艺工作的领导全盘否定，进而使其资产阶级文艺思想可以毫无约束地泛滥。
    在文联机关鸣放会上，栾星说，“人民日报发表的胡风反革命集团三批材料的编者按语有阴暗面、有副作用”。有的同志揭发栾星这种反革命言论不是出于今天，早在去年他就提出过“胡风反革命集团案件是不是一个大的‘文字狱’的问题”。这次鸣放中，他对“文字狱”又作了一些恶意的发挥，他说：“当今无产阶级专政、马克思主义的思想统治，比清朝的‘文字狱’还要凶，还要厉害”。
    目前省文联将进一步对右派分子栾星的言论进行驳斥，展开说理斗争，运动正深入开展中。
