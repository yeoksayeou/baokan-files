Xinhua News Agency, July 13th - Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are paying attention to implementing the principle of rectifying while correcting during the rectification campaign.

General Tang Liang, Political Commissar of the Nanjing Garrison, recently announced at a conference of representatives from Nanjing-based troops, agencies, and schools a decision to change the methods for leading cadres' use of vehicles, housing, and medical treatment. The decision stipulates that leading cadres cannot use cars for private matters; those living close to agencies can share a car with several people to go to work; special considerations such as reserving tickets and good seats for leading cadres in entertainment venues will be cancelled, and leading cadres will queue up to buy tickets for plays and movies like everyone else; the regulation that officers above the rank of school not register when seeking medical treatment will be abolished; unreasonable phenomena such as leading cadres and some senior cadres having too much housing should be adjusted.

The leading organs of the Navy and the Guangzhou Garrison have initially adjusted housing. After many sections and offices of the Navy's leading organs merged for office work, a number of rooms were freed up and converted into collective dormitories for cadres. A group of cadres from the leading organs of the Guangzhou Garrison have moved into dormitories vacated by leading cadres.

Many other units have taken measures to integrate officers and soldiers in their daily lives. The system of leading cadres meeting with soldiers established by a certain unit has been well received by the soldiers. Many soldiers have taken the initiative to find leading cadres to express their criticisms and opinions on various aspects. The practice of leading cadres helping with kitchen work on holidays has also become a system in a certain unit. Every Sunday, cadres go to the kitchen to help cooks prepare food and dishes. This unit has also promoted a system of agency cadres regularly residing in companies to help the companies and soldiers solve practical problems in a timely manner. Soldiers are very touched that officers eat, live, study, and work with them.

After studying the criticisms and suggestions made by senior intellectuals in the logistics system, the Party Committee of the Logistics Department of the Beijing Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army took many measures to improve its work. For example, it guaranteed the full implementation of the powers of non-Party cadres and made every effort to solve the problems of books, materials, and equipment for advancing towards science. A reply was given to each opinion.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 12th - According to the spirit of rectifying while correcting, agencies in Yunnan Province and Kunming City are gradually improving their work and leadership style.

At present, provincial and municipal government agencies have successively established special organizations, including non-Party members, responsible for sorting out and studying the opinions raised by the masses in the previous period and formulating specific plans for improving work.

Improvements that have already been made include: The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and the Kunming Municipal Party Committee have abolished the guard system, and the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee has also simplified entry and exit procedures. Starting in July, the work of the Provincial People's Committee in handling people's letters and visits has been personally led by a Deputy Governor, and each department and bureau has also designated a responsible cadre to directly lead this work. They will each devote a certain amount of time each month to personally read people's letters and meet with people's visits.

A climate of thrift and economy has emerged in provincial and municipal agencies. Leading cadres of various agencies have generally stopped taking cars to and from work and using public cars for private matters. Some special treatments for senior cadres have also been cancelled. Many leading cadres have also voluntarily vacated surplus houses and surplus furniture. Many agencies have announced the use of welfare funds in the past period, and some cadres have voluntarily returned unreasonable living allowances. Various agencies have recently conducted a general review of administrative expenses, and have taken measures such as modifying circuits and reducing light bulbs, distinguishing between public and private water use, cancelling unreasonable conference hospitality expenses, and cleaning up warehouses to utilize old materials, greatly reducing the expenditure of agency funds. Recently, the monthly telegram and telephone expenses of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee have only accounted for about 60% of the budget.

Many Party member cadres are also consciously improving their work style. All provincial and municipal agencies have now established fixed links with nearby factories and agricultural cooperatives. The participation of Kunming's leading cadres in physical labor is gradually becoming regularized.

    在整风中逐步改进工作
    解放军许多部队官兵生活打成一片
    云南省和昆明市各机关出现勤俭节约风气
    新华社13日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队在整风中注意贯彻边整边改的方针。
    南京驻军政治委员唐亮上将不久前在驻南京部队、机关、学校代表会议上，宣布了关于改变首长用车、住房、看病等办法的决定。这个决定规定首长有私事不能用小汽车，住得靠机关近的上班可以几人合乘一辆；取消娱乐场所留票、留好位置给首长等特殊照顾，今后看戏、看电影首长和大家一样排队买票；取消校以上军官看病不挂号的规定；对首长和某些高级干部住房过多的不合理现象，应进行调整。
    海军领导机关和广州驻军领导机关已经初步调整了住房。海军领导机关的许多科、处合并办公后，挤出了一批房间，改作干部的集体宿舍。广州驻军领导机关的一批干部，已经搬进了首长让出的宿舍。
    还有许多部队采取措施使官兵在生活上打成一片。某部建立的首长接见士兵的制度，大受士兵欢迎。不少士兵主动去找首长，谈出他们对各方面的批评和意见。某部首长假日帮助厨房工作也已形成制度，每星期日都有干部下厨房帮助炊事员做饭和做菜。这个部队还推行了机关干部常住连队，及时帮助连队和士兵解决实际问题的制度。士兵们对于军官和他们同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动，很受感动。
    中共北京部队后勤部党委研究了后勤系统高级知识分子提出的批评和建议后，采取了许多改进工作的措施。如保证非党干部充分实施职权；尽力解决向科学进军的图书资料和物资器材等。对每条意见都作到了有答复。
    新华社昆明12日电　云南省、昆明市各机关正在根据边整边改的精神，逐步改进工作和领导作风。
    目前，省、市级政府机关都陆续成立了包括党外人士参加的专门组织，负责整理和研究前一时期群众提出的意见，拟定改进工作的具体方案。
    现在已经改进的如：中共云南省委、昆明市委已经取消了门卫制度，省人民委员会也简化了出入手续。从7月份开始，省人民委员会处理人民来信来访的工作已经由一位副省长亲自领导起来，各厅、局也分别指定一个负责干部直接领导这一工作，他们将每月抽出一定的时间来亲自批阅人民来信和接见人民来访。
    省、市级机关已经出现了一片勤俭节约的气象。各机关领导干部已经普遍做到上、下班不坐汽车，私事不用公家汽车。高级干部的一些特殊待遇也都已经取消。许多领导干部并主动地让出了多余的房子和多余的家具。许多机关公布了过去一个时期的福利费的使用情况，有的干部主动地退出了不合理的生活补助费。各机关近来还普遍检查了行政费用的开支情况，分别采取了改装电路和改小灯泡、分清公私用水、取消不合理的会议招待费用、清理库房利用旧料等措施，大大减少了机关经费的开支。最近中共云南省委每月的电报、电话费支出只占预算的60％左右。
    许多党员干部也正在自觉地改进工作作风。所有省、市级机关，目前都分别和附近的工厂、农业社建立了固定的联系。昆明市领导干部参加体力劳动正在逐渐经常化。
