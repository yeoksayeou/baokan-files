I fully agree with the government's work reports. It demonstrates the authenticity of our national financial plan, the fulfillment and growth of the national economy according to budget, and the improvement of people's lives; it demonstrates that people's rights to freedom have been guaranteed; and that the authority of the law has been widely enhanced. I also agree with Vice Chairman Peng's report on the work of the Standing Committee.

I heard and saw Chairman Mao's instructions on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," which clearly explained the methods for us to distinguish right from wrong, resolve contradictions, and transform our thinking; and pointed out the formula of "unity—criticism—unity." These twelve instructions, based on the objective development requirements of our country's socialist construction, address contradictions in people's thinking in every sentence, encourage the advancement of socialist thought in every sentence, and are living examples of Marxist-Leninist philosophical laws in every sentence. They should not only serve as our compass in thought, speech, and action, but also be the most important, clearest, and most vivid lectures for us to learn Marxism-Leninism. In particular, the "Six Political Criteria" were put forward to facilitate those who "speak out" to do so better, and those who "unleash" to do so even more effectively. What most democratic personages cannot help but feel grateful and excited about is the proposal that "We hope that all democratic parties will pay attention to ideological remolding, strive to coexist with the Communist Party for a long time, and supervise each other to meet the needs of the new society." This is an extremely sincere, earnest, and far-sighted hope for the democratic parties, and also an extremely glorious and necessary task for the democratic parties in socialist construction.

Premier Zhou severely criticized the erroneous thinking of the right-wing elements in the government work report. I believe that Premier Zhou's words not only represent the vast number of working people in China, but also represent many progressive intellectuals. This criticism will certainly play a very good role.

At a time when the Chinese Communist Party's invitation to various democratic parties to participate in the rectification movement is progressing smoothly, most democratic personages feel that this great and brilliant rectification movement is unprecedented in ancient and modern history. Only under Chairman Mao's correct leadership, which has led the Chinese revolution to victory in a hundred battles and achieved brilliant achievements in socialist construction, and only a political party representing the proletariat that is not afraid of criticism can invite non-Party members to freely and fully express their criticisms. Unexpectedly, there have been speeches by right-wing elements opposing the Party and socialism. I never imagined that in the great new era, under the unity of the united front, and under Chairman Mao's kind education, a small number of senior staff members would have conspiracies against the Party and socialism, and some even wanted to take the opportunity to create a Hungarian incident, fish in troubled waters, and violate the interests of the people of the whole country, as well as the common wishes of the democratic parties. This is so astonishing, heartbreaking, and incredibly infuriating. This is not only intolerable to the vast number of working people, but also absolutely intolerable to us democratic personages.

Refuting the Absurd Arguments of the Right-Wing Elements

Some people say that the proletarian dictatorship system is not good. This is either a talk lacking political common sense or has ulterior motives. From my own personal experience, since I participated in the Tongmenghui led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen to carry out the revolution, after many arduous struggles, and also personally experienced the "two-party system" and "multi-party system" congresses, it was precisely because it was not a proletarian dictatorship system that it could not only fail to solve the suffering of the vast number of people, but also could not prevent politicians, warlords, and imperialists from colluding to do so many things that betrayed the country and harmed the people. There was simply no way to talk about developing domestic heavy industry, as well as light industry and agriculture. Since liberation, our country has undergone a hundred reforms. The first five-year plan for national economic construction can now be overfulfilled. The progress of industrial production far exceeds that of countries with capitalist systems. Some people actually say that the proletarian dictatorship system is not good. That is completely closing their eyes to the facts, blinded by greed, and indulging in fantasy.

The proletarian dictatorship system is to eliminate the system of exploitation of man by man and to build a socialist society by utilizing the proletarian regime. Without the proletarian dictatorship, how could we have cleared away all obstacles in the transitional period from the Five-Anti Campaign; how could we have achieved the victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, which unprecedentedly enhanced our international prestige; how could we have given strong support to weak and small countries in Asia and Africa, and played a great role in safeguarding world peace. It is absolutely wrong to blame the proletarian dictatorship system for the shortcomings in the work style of some Party member cadres. Now, isn't the rectification movement to correct deviations and mistakes? Some people actually want to take advantage of the rectification opportunity to develop anti-Party conspiracies. This is very absurd.

Some people say that agricultural cooperatives are "a complete mess." In the past two years, I have inspected dozens of agricultural cooperatives in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Hunan provinces and cities. None of the cooperatives I saw failed to increase production. In 1956, the great floods in the north and the severe drought in the south caused some agricultural cooperatives to reduce production. This was an accidental phenomenon caused by severe natural disasters, while increasing production is the inevitable law of agricultural cooperatives. To observe problems, one cannot only look at superficial, partial, and accidental phenomena, but should see that in last year's severe disasters, agricultural collectivization rescued and preserved a considerable output of many crops. Last year, there was a severe drought in Hunan, with no rain for two hundred days. In Ningxiang County, I saw water conservancy organizations where farmers pedaled waterwheels, connecting and turning up seven levels. More than twenty farmers cooperated together to pump water. If it were not for agricultural collectivization, how could there be such water conservancy organizations. Looking again at this year's National Agricultural Exhibition, the Liling County cooperative on display, even though it encountered last year's two hundred-day drought, still increased production compared to 1955. This all demonstrates the superiority of agricultural collectivization and also demonstrates the inevitability of increased production in agricultural cooperatives. People who say that agricultural cooperatives are a complete mess had better live in the countryside for a period of time and get to know them personally.

The saying "Party's world" – from what standpoint does one view this issue? Only by standing on the narrow-minded sectarian position of the bourgeoisie can such an absurd statement be conceived. Such a statement (1) does not conform to objective facts. Judging from the provisions of the Constitution; from the participation of democratic personages in political work; from the united front and the work of the CPPCC, the unity and cooperation of the people of the whole country; and from the class nature and people's nature in the philosophy of dialectical materialism, the statement "Party's world" is completely inconsistent with objective facts and has no theoretical basis. (2) From the perspective of socialist development, the saying "Party's world" is very short-sighted. From the standpoint of socialism, the Party spirit is to mobilize the vast number of intellectuals to jointly improve socialist moral qualities through ideological remolding, so as to jointly build socialism and communism; and to jointly enter a communist society where classes are eliminated and parties are eliminated. If you think this way, I hope that everyone will improve their qualities like communists, be selfless, "the world is for all," and "each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." What an ideal, lofty, bright, and beautiful society that would be! Principal Wu Yuzhang said: "Treating my compatriots as myself, and considering things as shared, is the spirit of socialism"; Minister Li Weihan said: "The Communist Party's responsibility is to liberate all mankind"; Marxism-Leninism is to "transform the world." Whoever wants to prevent the transformation of the world will surely be abandoned by the vast number of people and will be crushed by the wheels of socialism.

Some people say that proletarian dictatorship is the root cause of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism. I have read "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and many of Chairman Mao's essays and articles since liberation, as well as many documents issued by Party and government organs, all based on the spirit of "seeking truth from facts," combined with the opinions of the masses, and uniting all forces that can be united. Not only can I not find a sentence that can produce the root cause of the three isms, but on the contrary, in the articles on various rectification movements and in "Reform Our Study," the three isms are clearly and thoroughly criticized. Especially in April 1945, "On the Army's Production for Self-Sufficiency, and on the Importance of Rectification and Production Movements," it was pointed out that non-Marxist ideology was brought about by the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, proletarian dictatorship is not only not the root cause of the three isms, but must eliminate the three isms in order to fully realize the truth of Marxism. It is too improper to slander the Party in this way during the rectification period.

Premier Zhou repeatedly urged the right-wing elements to abandon their anti-socialist stance, "turn around, repent, and accept transformation," opening a door of socialist transformation for them. I hope they will immediately confess everything and accept socialist transformation, so as not to isolate themselves from the people.

Premier Zhou's solemn criticism of the right-wing elements is to prevent socialism from being sabotaged and to promote the victorious progress of socialism. It is a timely and necessary measure. This report will certainly play a great and good role in socialist transformation and construction.

(1) The vast number of working people, seeing the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, will naturally arouse indignation and wage a firm struggle. This report, with its timely and stern criticism of right-wing remarks, can calm public anger and appease people's hearts, playing a certain unifying role for all strata.

(2) Progressive intellectuals and general intellectuals may hear right-wing remarks, which confuse the public. But after hearing this report, they can clarify their thinking, further improve their understanding, and move forward, enhancing their study of Marxism-Leninism through the practice of struggle.

(3) It provides us with weapons to expose and shatter the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracies of the right-wing elements. I warn the right-wing elements to repent as early as possible, honestly and thoroughly confess to the people, and not to isolate themselves from the people.

(4) Criticizing the mistakes of the right-wing elements is more conducive to the rectification movement.

We Need to Work Harder to Transform Our Thinking

At the same time, in view of the mistakes made by the right-wing elements, we further recognize the necessity of ideological remolding. It is not easy for the democratic personages of the bourgeoisie to adapt to the needs of the new society if they do not abandon all old non-socialist ideas.

Premier Zhou especially emphasized in his report: "What the vast number of people hope for from the democratic parties is to firmly stand on the socialist position, pay attention to ideological remolding, and fully play their active role in national life." This is the same as what Chairman Mao hoped for from the democratic parties, which is extremely sincere, earnest, and far-sighted. Why ideological remolding? This is by no means being harsh on democratic personages, but simply because bourgeois thinking is not in line with socialist society. Because it is hoped that the democratic parties will jointly enter socialist and even communist society, we cannot but hope that they will pay attention to ideological remolding. These are words of advice and medicine for treating illnesses and saving people. We should humbly and sincerely accept these admonitions, constantly examine ourselves, constantly transform ourselves from social practice, firmly stand on the socialist position, fight against our own non-socialist thoughts, and fight against all anti-socialist thoughts, in order to fully play an active role in national life and bravely fight.

If we want to transform our thinking well, we must pay attention to clarifying our position. Premier Zhou's report mentioned "position" in many places. Chairman Mao once again pointed out in "Reform Our Study": "Find the position, find the viewpoint, find the method." If we do not put our thinking on the socialist position, it is impossible to fully understand the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and consequently, there will easily be great errors in viewpoints and methods. Therefore, I feel that it is necessary to regard the question of position as a key issue in ideological remolding. In order to remold our thinking well, we must first firmly stand on the socialist position.

Great Marxism-Leninism and the great Chinese Communist Party, for the liberation of all mankind and for the interests of the vast number of working people, have experienced many arduous struggles and many great sacrifices to have today's socialist world. Today, we need to stand together with the vast number of working people, completely centering our thoughts on the interests of the working people in our thinking and life practice, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, bravely move towards the beautiful and bright socialist world.

### 立场问题是思想改造的关键  王葆真的发言

    立场问题是思想改造的关键
    王葆真的发言
    我完全同意政府各项工作的报告。它说明了我国财政计划的真实性和国民经济按照预算的完成、增长以及人民生活的改善；说明人民自由权利的获得了保证；法律威信的广泛提高。我并同意彭副委员长关于常委会的工作报告。
    我听到并看到毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的指示，很明确讲给我们明辨是非、解决矛盾、改造思想的方法；并指明“团结——批评——团结”的公式。这十二项指示，目前都就我国社会主义建设客观发展的要求，句句是解决人们思想上的矛盾，句句是鼓励社会主义思想的提高，句句也是马列主义哲学规律中活生生的事例。它不仅是应当作为我们思想上、言论上、行动上的指南针，而且是我们学习马列主义最重要、最显明、最生动的讲课。特别是指出了“六条政治标准”以便于鸣者鸣的更好，放者放的更佳。最令民主人士不能不感激兴奋的，是提出“我们希望各民主党派都能注意思想改造，争取和共产党一道长期共存，互相监督，以适应新社会的需要”。这是对民主党派以极其诚恳、殷切、远大的希望，也是民主党派在社会主义建设中极其光荣而必须做好的任务。
    周总理在政府工作报告中，义正辞严地批判了右派分子的错误思想。我认为周总理的话，不仅是代表了中国广大的劳动人民，也代表了许多前进的知识分子。这一批判，一定起到很好的作用。
    在中国共产党邀请各民主党派参加整风运动正在顺利开展的时候，大多数民主人士都感觉到这一伟大英明的整风运动为古今中外历史所未有，只有在毛主席正确地领导中国革命百战百胜以及社会主义建设取得辉煌成就的今日，也只有不怕批评的代表无产阶级的政党，才能邀请党外人士大放大鸣地提出批评。不料，竟出现了反党、反社会主义右派分子的言论。我万也想不到在伟大的新时代，在统一战线的团结下，在毛主席亲切的教育下，竟有少数高级工作人员有反党、反社会主义的阴谋，甚至有人想乘机造成匈牙利事件，混水摸鱼，违反了全国人民的利益，也违反了民主党派共同的意愿。这是多么令人惊异痛心、无比愤怒的事情，这不仅是广大劳动人民所不能容许，更是我们民主人士所断断不能容忍。
    驳斥右派分子的荒谬言论
    有人说：无产阶级专政制度不好。这不是缺乏政治常识的谈话就是别有用心。我就自己亲身的经历来说：自从参加中山先生领导的同盟会进行革命以来，经过多少次艰苦斗争，也亲身经历过“两党制”和“多党制”的国会，就是因为不是无产阶级专政制度，不但不能解决广大人民的疾苦，也不能防止政客、军阀与帝国主义相勾结作出多少卖国残民的事情，对发展国内重工业以及轻工业和农业，根本无从谈起。自解放以来，我国百政维新，第一个五年国民经济建设计划，现在已可超额完成，工业增产进度，远过于资本主义制度的国家，竟有人说无产阶级专政制度不好，那完全是闭着眼睛不看事实，利令智昏，痴人说梦。
    无产阶级专政制度是为了消灭人剥削人的制度，是利用无产阶级政权来建设社会主义社会。如果没有无产阶级专政，何能从五大运动廓清过渡时期的一切障碍；何能有抗美援朝的胜利，空前地提高了国际威信；何能对亚非弱小国家作强有力的声援，起了保卫世界和平的伟大作用。万不该因为有些党员干部作风有缺点，错怪了无产阶级专政的制度。现在，整风运动，不就是为了改正偏差和错误么？竟有人想利用整风的时机，发展反党的阴谋，这是非常荒谬的。
    有人说，农业合作社“一团糟”。我这两年视察河北、山东、河南、江苏、浙江、上海、湖南各省市的几十个农业合作社，我所看的社，没有一个不是增产的。一九五六年北方大水灾，南方大旱灾，有若干农业社减产，这是因为自然灾害严重所发生偶然性的现象，而增加生产乃是农业合作社必然性的规律。因为农业社会主义合作化的集体经营，比个体的小农经济优越得多。观察问题不能只看表面的、局部的、偶然的现象，应当看在去年的严重灾害中，由于农业合作化抢救和保住许多农作物相当的产量。去年湖南大旱，二百天不落雨，我在宁乡县看到水利组织，农民脚踏水车，连接翻上七级，翻水农民二十余人共同合作，若非农业合作化，那能有这样的水利组织。再看今年全国农业展览会，展出的醴陵县合作社，虽遇到去年二百天的旱灾，仍比一九五五年增了产，这都说明了农业合作化的优越性，也说明农业合作社增产的必然性。说农业合作社一团糟的人，最好到乡下生活一个时期，亲自认识认识。
    “党天下”的说法，是从那个立场看问题呢？除了站在资产阶级狭隘的宗派主义立场，是不会想出这样荒谬的说法的。这样说法，（一）不符合客观事实。从宪法上的规定来看；从民主人士参与政治工作来看；从统一战线和政协工作、全国人民的团结合作来看；从辩证唯物主义的哲学上阶级性和人民性来看，“党天下”的说法，都是完全不符合客观的事实，是无理论根据的。（二）从社会主义的发展来看，“党天下”的说法，是非常没有远见的。从社会主义的立场来看，党性是要发动广大知识分子通过思想改造，共同提高社会主义道德品质，以共同建设社会主义和共产主义；以共同进入阶级消灭、党派消灭的共产主义社会。如果这样想，但愿人人提高如共产党员的品质，忘我无私，“天下为公”，“各尽所能，各取所需”，那是多么理想崇高光明美好的社会呀！吴玉章校长说：“民吾同胞，物吾同与，是社会主义的精神”；李维汉部长说：“共产党的责任，是要解放全人类”；马列主义就是要“改造世界”。谁要阻止改造世界，它一定要被广大人民所共弃，要被社会主义的车轮压的粉碎。
    有人说，无产阶级专政是主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义产生的根源。我看了“毛泽东选集”和解放以后毛主席许多文论，及党政机关发布许多文件，无非本着“实事求是”的精神结合群众的意见，并团结一切可能团结的力量。不但找不出一句话可以产生三个主义的根源，相反地，有关各次整风运动的文章中和“改造我们的学习”中，都很显明地，深透地批判了三个主义。特别是在一九四五年四月“论军队生产自给，兼论整风和生产两大运动的重要性”指明了非马克思主义思想是由小资产阶级所带来。因此，无产阶级专政，不但不是三个主义产生的根源，而且必须要把三个主义整掉，才能完全实现马克思主义的真理。在整风时期，如此诬蔑党，是太不应该的。
    周总理再三申告右派分子放弃反社会主义的立场，“幡然悔悟，接受改造”。给他们开了一面社会主义改造的大门。我希望他们立即坦白一切，接受社会主义改造，免至自绝于人民。
    周总理对右派分子这一严正的批判，是为了防止社会主义遭到破坏，并为了推动社会主义胜利的迈进，是适时而必要的措施。这一报告，对社会主义改造和建设，一定起到很大、很好的作用。
    （1）广大劳动人民，看到反党、反社会主义的言论，当然激起义愤，作坚强的斗争。这一报告，及时给右派言论以严正的批评，才能平众愤以安人心，对各阶层都起了一定的团结作用。
    （2）前进的知识分子和一般知识分子，可能听到右派言论，混淆视听，自听到这一报告，即可澄清思想，更加提高认识，向前迈进，从斗争的实践中，提高了马列主义的学习。
    （3）给了我们揭露和粉碎右派分子反共、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋以武器。我正告右派分子，应及早悔悟，老实彻底向人民交代清楚，勿自绝于人民。
    （4）批判了右派分子的错误，更利于整风运动。
    我们要更努力地改造自己的思想
    同时，我们鉴于右派分子发生的错误，更认识思想改造的必要。原来资产阶级的民主人士，如不放弃一切非社会主义的旧思想，要想适应于新社会的需要，也是很不容易的。
    周总理报告中，特别着重地指出：“广大人民所希望于各民主党派的就是坚定地站在社会主义的立场上，注意进行思想改造，以充分发挥他们在国家生活中的积极作用”。这和毛主席的指示中所希望各民主党派的，是同样地极其真切、诚恳而远大的。为什么要思想改造呢？这决不是苛责于民主人士，只是因为资产阶级的思想是不符合于社会主义社会的。因为希望各民主党派共同进入社会主义以至共产主义的社会，因而不能不希望注意进行思想改造。这是治病救人药石之言，我们应当虚心地真诚地接纳忠告，时时检查自己，时时从社会实践中改造自己，坚定地站在社会主义的立场上，向自己非社会主义的思想作斗争，向一切反社会主义的思想作斗争，为了充分发挥在国家生活中的积极作用而勇敢斗争。
    我们要想把自己思想改造好，必须注意明确自己的立场。周总理报告中许多处谈到“立场”。毛主席在“改造我们的学习”中，曾再次指出“找立场、找观点、找方法”。我们如果不把自己的思想放在社会主义的立场，就不可能完全理解马列主义的道理，因而观点、方法就很容易发生极大的错误。因此，我觉得需要把立场问题，看作思想改造的关键性问题，为了改好自己的思想，必须首先坚定地站在社会主义的立场。
    伟大的马列主义、伟大的中国共产党，为了解放全人类、为了广大劳动人民的利益，曾经历了几多艰苦斗争和几多巨大的牺牲，才有今日社会主义的世界。我们今日需要和广大劳动人民站在一起，从自己思想中和生活实践中，完全以劳动人民利益为思想中心，在共产党的领导下，向着美好光明的社会主义的世界勇敢迈进。
