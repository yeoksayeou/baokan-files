The people's own soldiers are forever loyal to the people
Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association

Historical memories are often inspiring.

Thirty years ago, after the Kuomintang betrayed its faith and carried out a shameless counter-revolutionary coup, the whole country was shrouded in gloom, and the sky suddenly turned dark. However, the heroic Chinese Communists and the revolutionary Chinese people "were not intimidated, conquered, or killed off. They crawled out of the ground, wiped the blood from their bodies, buried the bodies of their comrades, and continued to fight." On August 1, 1927, Comrades Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Ye Ting, He Long, and others led an army of 30,000 to launch the Nanchang Uprising. From then on, the Chinese people created their own armed forces - the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army; from then on, the Chinese people established Soviet power, and the red flag with the sickle and axe fluttered in the wind on Jinggang Mountain. Over the past thirty years, under the correct leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has grown from nothing, from small to large, from weak to strong, and has experienced the fiery trials of two revolutions. It has become a mighty force that is armed with Marxism-Leninism, has modern technical equipment and a high level of technical expertise, and is capable of joint operations by various services and arms.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army of both wisdom and courage, both civil and military, good at fighting, and also skilled in production and construction. How many in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, can match it!

From the end of 1930 to February 1933, the Kuomintang army launched four large-scale encirclements and suppressions against the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. The Red Army won complete victories in all four counter-encirclements, and its ranks grew and expanded accordingly. In October 1934, the Central Red Army withdrew from the Jiangxi base area and carried out the unprecedented and moving 25,000-li Long March. Under the bombing and pursuit of the enemy, the soldiers climbed high mountains, crossed grasslands, broke through the natural barrier of the Wujiang River, seized the Luding Bridge, and finally arrived at the Shaanxi-Gansu base area after all kinds of hardships. After the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan, in the dangerous situation and disadvantage of strong enemies pressing on the border, the Kuomintang army's layers of blockade and full-scale attack, and without any foreign aid, it learned guerrilla and mobile warfare tactics from the war, drove out the Japanese invaders, opened up revolutionary base areas, and in the Liberation War, it further conquered the north and suppressed the south, from the white mountains and black waters outside the pass to the coconut groves of Hainan Island, defeating the eight million Kuomintang troops "fed" by six billion US aid. In the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, its outstanding soldiers participated in the Chinese People's Volunteers and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army, driving the US aggressors back to the 38th parallel, disrupting the US imperialist timetable for aggression, and creating an unprecedented defeat in US war history.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is even more adept at engaging in industrial and agricultural production, making full use of time and space, in long-term and fierce battles, which not only reduced the burden on the people, but also strengthened the officers and soldiers' labor concepts and discipline, thereby improving the relationship between officers and soldiers and the relationship between the army and the people, becoming an excellent tradition. After liberation, it further responded to the Party's call and plunged into the massive tide of production, assisting farmers in spring plowing and autumn harvest. In many floods, in addition to providing food and clothing to ensure that no one was frozen or starved, the PLA soldiers stood at the forefront of flood control, even sacrificing their most precious lives on the Yellow River flood area in Henan and the Zhanggong Dyke in Wuhan. In addition, they are also skilled in building dikes, bridges, and roads. Rivers make way for them, and high mountains bow their heads to them. They have set a living example of man's determination to conquer nature.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the people's army. The soldiers are the sons and daughters of the working people. They share the fate, breathe the same air, and are connected by flesh and blood with the broad masses of the people. Under the education of the Party, they are even more able to serve and devote themselves to the people wholeheartedly and loyally under conscious discipline. They understand that fighting for the people is their sacred responsibility and supreme honor.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a democratic army. The soldiers were persecuted and exploited in the old society, and everyone has endless grievances to tell. However, once they enter the big family of the People's Liberation Army, bathed in the glory of revolutionary humanitarianism, they begin to feel the dignity and value of human beings, and everyone has equal personality. They are not mercenaries of any one person, they are the guardians of the country and the bridges of society. They have the freedom to criticize the shortcomings of their superiors' work and to suggest combat methods, as well as the obligation to obey their superiors' orders. The Chinese People's Liberation Army practices political democracy, military democracy, and economic democracy, and implements consistency between officers and soldiers, between the military and the people, and unity with our friends. It is an army that implements a high degree of centralism on a broad democratic basis. The combination of democracy and centralism, the combination of leadership and the masses, is the unswerving line of work of this army, and enables it to exert unparalleled power.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is an army of justice. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great furnace. After thousands of trials and tribulations, the soldiers' class consciousness has been unprecedentedly improved, which in turn inspires them to fight for the liberation of the Chinese people and the defense of world peace. This sacred mission makes them righteous and strong as steel in the face of any severe test, invincible and unconquerable.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the apple of the people's eye. Under its illumination, any demons and monsters will have nowhere to hide; the Chinese People's Liberation Army is the weapon in the people's hands. Under its counterattack, any ghosts and monsters will be smashed to pieces.

Right-wing gentlemen! I solemnly warn you: the people are a big tree, and you are mayflies. How can mayflies shake a big tree? With the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of workers and peasants, what is there to fear from your rebellion? Your only way out is: surrender. Whoever does not surrender will perish!

The wise and courageous people's own soldiers! I cheer for you! I salute you!

    人民的子弟兵永远忠于人民
    中国民主建国会中央委员会主任委员  黄炎培
    历史的回忆往往是令人振奋的。
    三十年前，在国民党背信弃义，实行无耻的反革命政变之后，全国一片阴霾，霎时天昏地暗。但是，英勇的中国共产党员和中国革命人民“并没有被吓倒，被征服，被杀绝，他们从地下爬起来，揩干身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了”。1927年8月1日，由周恩来、朱德、叶挺、贺龙诸同志率众三万，在南昌举行武装起义。从此，中国人民创造了自己的武装——工农红军；从此，中国人民建立了苏维埃政权，镰刀、斧头的红旗在井冈山上迎风飘扬。三十年来，中国人民解放军在党的正确领导和全国人民的支援下，从无到有，由小而大，转弱为强，经历两次革命的烈火锻炼，蔚为今日一支既有马列主义思想武装，又有现代技术装备和高度技术水平的诸兵种会同作战的军队，巍巍然不可摇撼的巨大力量。
    中国人民解放军是一支智勇双全，允文允武，既善于作战，又是生产、建设能手的圣军，古今中外，能有几个跟它匹敌！
    从1930年底到1933年2月，国民党军队曾向工农红军四次大围攻，红军在四次反围攻中都获全胜，队伍也随之而发展、壮大。1934年10月，中央红军退出江西根据地，进行了史无前例的、可歌可泣的二万五千里长征，在敌人的轰炸和追迫下，战士们越高山，涉草地，突破了乌江天险，飞夺了泸定大桥，历尽千辛万苦，终于到达了陕北根据地。全面抗战后，它又在强敌压境，国民党军队层层封锁和全面进攻，以及毫无外援的险境和劣势下，从战争中学会了游击和运动战术，驱逐了日本侵略军，开辟了革命根据地，在解放战争中，它更北征南剿，从关外的白山黑水打到海南岛的椰子林，击溃了在六十亿美援“喂养”下的八百万国民党军队。在抗美援朝中，它的优秀健儿，参加了中国人民志愿军，与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，把美国侵略军赶回三八线，打乱了美帝的侵略进程表，造成了美国战争史上前所未有的惨败。
    中国人民解放军更在长期的、激烈的战斗中，善于利用时间和空间，从事工农业生产，不但减轻了人民负担，而且增强了官兵的劳动观点和纪律性，从而改善了官兵关系和军民关系，成为一个优良的传统。解放后，它更响应党的号召，投入大规模的生产洪流，协助农民春耕，秋收。在多次水灾中，解放军战士除了解衣推食，不让有一个人冻饿外，更奋不顾身，站在防汛的最前列，在河南的黄泛区和武汉的张公堤上，他们甚至献出了最宝贵的生命。此外，他们更是修堤架桥和筑路的能手，河水为他们让路，高山向他们低头。他们做了人定胜天的活榜样。
    中国人民解放军是人民的军队。战士们是劳动人民的儿女，他们与广大人民共命运，同呼吸，血肉相连。在党的教育下，他们更能够在自觉的纪律下，全心全意为人民效劳、尽忠。他们明白，为人民而战是他们神圣的责任和无上的光荣。
    中国人民解放军是民主的军队。战士们在旧社会里遭迫害，受剥削，每一个人都有诉不尽的衷肠。可是，一到了人民解放军的大家庭里，在革命的人道主义的光辉沐浴下，他们开始感受到人的尊严和价值，他们人人有平等的人格。他们不是那一个人的雇佣兵，他们是国家的干城，社会的桥梁。他们有向上级批评工作缺点，建议作战方法的自由，也有对上级命令服从的义务。中国人民解放军实行政治民主，军事民主和经济民主，实行官兵一致，军兵一致和友我一致，它是一支在广泛的民主基础上实行高度集中的军队。民主与集中的结合，领导与群众的结合，是这支军队坚定不移的工作路线，并使它发挥无比强大的力量。
    中国人民解放军是正义的军队。中国人民解放军是一座大洪炉，战士们经过千锤百炼，阶级觉悟空前提高，更转而激励他们为解放中国人民和保卫世界和平而战。这个神圣的任务使他们在任何严酷的考验面前，正义磅礴，凝结得像钢铁般坚强，攻无不克，战无不胜。
    中国人民解放军是人民的掌上明珠，在它的照耀下，任何魅魑魍魉都将无所遁形；中国人民解放军是人民的手中武器，在它的反击下，任何牛鬼蛇神都将粉身碎骨。
    右派先生们！我严正地警告你们：人民是大树，你们是蜉蝣，蜉蝣怎么能够把大树摇撼。有了人民解放军，有了广大的工农群众，还怕你们造反。你们唯一的生路就是：投降。谁不投降，就自取灭亡！
    智勇双全的人民的子弟兵！我向你们欢呼！我向你们致敬！
