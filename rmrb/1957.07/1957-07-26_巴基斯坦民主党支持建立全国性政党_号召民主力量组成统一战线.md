Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, July 25th: The Supreme Council of the Pakistan Democratic Party unanimously resolved on July 23rd to actively participate in the Democratic Parties' Representatives Conference convened by Maulana Bhashani in Dhaka on July 25th. They welcomed activities dedicated to forming an all-Pakistan political party and expressed satisfaction with the steps taken by Bhashani and the National Awami Party in this regard.
  The Democratic Party's Supreme Council meeting opened on July 21st in Barisal, East Pakistan. The meeting lasted for three days, attended by two hundred members of the Supreme Council and two hundred and fifty party representatives.
  Democratic Party Chairman Daanish reiterated the demand for the implementation of an independent and neutral foreign policy, stating that the Baghdad Pact, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and the Pakistani-American military agreement had politically disfigured Pakistan in the past four years. He pointed out that these military treaties increased tension and the possibility of a third world war. He opposed the interference of SEATO and Baghdad Pact member states in Pakistan's internal affairs and opposed extraterritorial rights for Americans in Pakistan. Daanish said: "Our powerful allies are not the United Kingdom and the United States, but the peace-loving and democratic people of the whole world, and we should strive for their friendship."
  When representatives of the National Awami Party, invited to participate in the Democratic Party's Supreme Council meeting, appeared at the venue, the entire audience chanted slogans such as "East and West Pakistanis are brothers!" "Down with British and American imperialism!" and "Abolish the US-Pakistan military agreement!" National Awami Party leader Mian Iftikharuddin delivered a speech at the meeting, calling on the democratic forces of East and West Pakistan to form a united front in order to realize the ideals pursued by Pakistan.

    巴基斯坦民主党支持建立全国性政党
    号召民主力量组成统一战线
    新华社卡拉奇25日电　巴基斯坦民主党最高委员会7月23日一致决议积极参加大毛拉巴沙尼于7月25日在达卡召开的民主党派代表会议，欢迎致力组成一个全巴基斯坦的政党的活动，并且对巴沙尼和民族党在这一方面采取的步骤表示满意。
    民主党最高委员会是在7月21日在东巴基斯坦的巴里萨尔开幕的。会议举行了三天，出席会议的有二百名最高委员会的委员和二百五十名党代表。
    民主党主席丹尼什在会上重申执行独立的中立外交政策的要求，并且说，巴格达条约、东南亚条约组织和巴美军事协定在过去四年中已经使巴基斯坦在政治上面目全非。他指出，这些军事条约增加了紧张气氛和第三次世界大战的可能性。他反对东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约成员国干涉巴基斯坦内政，反对美国人在巴基斯坦享有治外法权。丹尼什说：“我们的强大的盟友不是联合王国和美国，而是全世界爱好和平的民主人民，我们应该争取他们的友谊。”
  当应邀参加民主党最高委员会会议的民族党的代表在会场出现时，全场高呼“东西巴基斯坦人是兄弟！”“打倒英美帝国主义！”“废除美巴军事协定”等口号。民族党领袖米安·伊夫蒂卡鲁丁在会上发表演说，号召东西巴基斯坦的民主力量组成一条统一战线，以便实现巴基斯坦所追求的理想。
