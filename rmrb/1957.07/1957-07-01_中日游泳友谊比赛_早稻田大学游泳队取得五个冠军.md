Sino-Japanese Swimming Friendship Competition
Waseda University Swimming Team Wins Five Championships

(Reported by our newspaper) A friendly swimming competition was held yesterday between the Chinese Youth Swimming Team and the Japanese Waseda University Swimming Team at the Taoranting Swimming Pool in Beijing. In the seven events, the Waseda University Swimming Team won five first places, while the Chinese Youth Swimming Team won first place in the men's 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke.

The five events in which the visiting team excelled were the men's 100-meter and 400-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, backstroke, and the men's 400-meter medley relay.

The 400-meter medley relay, combining backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle, was a fierce and exciting competition. As soon as the starting gun fired, Japan's national backstroke champion, Hase, took the lead. When he reached 100 meters, China's Huang Tansheng was far behind him. However, in the second leg, Mu Xiangxiong's breaststroke quickly caught up with Japan's Ota, and surpassed him by the end of the leg. In the third leg, the butterfly, Japan's Sakai overtook Wang Qiangli again. At the start of the final leg, Lin Jinzhu worked hard to catch up, and at 60 meters, he had overtaken Japan's national freestyle champion, Koga. However, as they approached the finish line, Koga surpassed him again. The visiting team's time was 4 minutes 29.5 seconds, and the home team lost by half a second.

Although Qi Lieyun won the 100-meter breaststroke with a time of 1 minute 13 seconds, this was 1.4 seconds slower than his time of 1 minute 11.6 seconds (breaking the world record) which he recently set in Guangzhou.

During the competition, teenagers from the Beijing Municipal Juvenile Amateur Swimming Sports School also performed various dives from the 7-meter and 10-meter high platforms.

After the competition, Premier Zhou and Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi shook hands with the athletes one by one and took photos together.

    中日游泳友谊比赛
    早稻田大学游泳队取得五个冠军
    本报讯　中国青年游泳队昨日在北京陶然亭游泳场对日本早稻田大学游泳队进行了一场友谊比赛，在七个比赛项目中，早稻田大学游泳队取得了五个第一名，中国青年游泳队取得了男子一百公尺、二百公尺蛙泳第一名。
    客队取得优胜的五个项目是男子一百公尺、四百公尺自由泳、一百公尺蝶泳、仰泳和男子四百公尺混合式接力。
    四百公尺仰泳、蛙泳、蝶泳和自由泳的混合式接力比赛，是一场激烈、动人的争夺比赛。枪声一响，日本的全国仰泳冠军长谷一路领先，当他到达一百公尺时，我国的黄潭胜远落在他的后面，但是第二棒穆祥雄的蛙泳却飞快地赶上了日本的太田，到达终点时反而超出，第三棒蝶泳日本的阪井又超过了王强立，最后一棒一开始林锦珠便努力赶上，在六十公尺时反已超过日本的全国自由泳冠军古贺，但快到终点时，又被古贺超出。客队的成绩是四分二十九秒五，主队以半秒之差败北。
    戚烈云虽然以一分十三秒的成绩取得了百公尺蛙泳的冠军，但这个成绩比他不久以前在广州创造的一分十一秒六（打破世界纪录）差了一秒四。
    在比赛中间，北京市少年业余游泳体育学校的青少年还在七公尺、十公尺高的跳台上，作了各种姿势的花式跳水表演。
    比赛完毕，周总理和贺龙、陈毅副总理和运动员一一握了手，并在一起照了相。
