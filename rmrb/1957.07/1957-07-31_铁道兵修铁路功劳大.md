Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: The Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has made many glorious contributions to the country's railway construction.

    During the Liberation War, the Railway Corps followed the various Liberation Armies to repair railways on major battlefields, supporting our front-line troops. In the last two years of the Liberation War, the Railway Corps repaired and opened more than 1,620 kilometers of railways and 976 bridges. In the year following the victory of the Liberation War, they restored 267 bridges and 146 kilometers of lines in the permanent restoration projects of several major trunk lines, such as the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the Longhai Railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and the Tongpu Railway, gradually restoring railway transportation to normal. At the same time, they undertook some new construction projects, including the construction of the Lai (Bin) - Mu (Nanguan) Railway and two forest railways in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains.

    With the implementation of China's First Five-Year Plan, the Railway Corps also actively participated in large-scale railway construction projects with unprecedented construction enthusiasm, including the construction of the Lizhan Railway, the Yingxia Railway, and the Baolan Railway currently under intense construction.

    In the First Five-Year Plan's railway construction projects, they also undertook the new construction of the Bi (Sezhai) - He (Kou) section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Jin (Chengjiang) - Du (Yun) section of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, the Nan (Ping) - Fu (Zhou) line in Fujian, the Hanshui Railway Bridge, the Yongjiang Bridge, and the Wuhan Hub Station. In total, since 1954, the Railway Corps has undertaken or cooperated with other units on nearly twenty important railway construction projects, and by the end of May 1957, it had laid a total of 1,534 kilometers and 482 meters of track.

    铁道兵修铁路功劳大
    据新华社28日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵部队，在祖国铁道建设中作出了许多光荣的贡献。
    铁道兵部队在解放战争时期就曾跟随各路解放大军在各个主要战场上抢修铁路，支援前线我军作战。解放战争最后两年内，由铁道兵部队抢修通车的铁路达到一千六百二十多公里，桥梁有九百七十六座。在解放战争胜利后的一年内，他们又在京汉路、粤汉路、陇海路、浙赣路、同蒲路等几条主要干线的永久复旧工程中，修复了桥梁二百六十七座，线路一百四十六公里，使铁路运输逐渐地恢复了正常状态。同时，他们还担负了部分新建工程。其中重要的工程有来（宾）睦（南关）铁路的建筑工程和大、小兴安岭地区的两条森林铁路工程。
    随着我国第一个五年计划的开始实施，铁道兵部队也以空前的建设热情积极地参加了大规模的铁路建设工程。其中有黎湛铁路的建设工程、鹰厦铁路的建筑工程和目前正在紧张施工的包兰铁路工程。
    在第一个五年计划铁路建设项目中，他们还担负了滇越铁路的碧（色寨）河（口）段、湘桂黔铁路的金（城江）都（匀）段新建工程，福建的南（平）福（州）线，汉水铁桥、邕江大桥和武汉枢纽站等项新建工程。总计从1954年以来，铁道兵担任或与其他单位合作的重要铁路建设项目已近二十项，到1957年5月底为止，累计已铺轨一千五百三十四公里四百八十二公尺。
