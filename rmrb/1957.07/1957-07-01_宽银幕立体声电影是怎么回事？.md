What is Wide-Screen Stereophonic Film?
    Qiú Yùzhōng
    Today, China's first wide-screen stereophonic cinema opened in Beijing. The invention of wide-screen stereophonic film has aroused great interest and provided the art of film with more diverse means of expression, strengthening its power of infection. The screen of a wide-screen stereophonic film is generally more than twice as large as an ordinary screen, almost equivalent to the range of human vision. Its stereophonic sound, emanating from numerous loudspeakers, also makes you feel real. When the lights in the cinema go out and the wide-screen stereophonic film begins, you feel as if you are there.

    Wide-screen stereophonic films have developed rapidly in countries around the world. They can be roughly divided into two major categories. One category uses 65mm wide film to shoot, or three cameras to shoot simultaneously, and then project them simultaneously, so that three 35mm wide films are combined into a complete image on the screen. Its screen is curved and made of a rubber-like material. This type is ideal in terms of sound and light quality and is suitable for large or open-air cinemas, but the entire production process and the equipment required for projection must be re-manufactured, which is very uneconomical. The other type uses anamorphic lenses. This anamorphic lens is added to an ordinary camera, and when shooting, it can compress the image on a 35mm negative horizontally by a factor of two, making it long and thin, just like the comical image we see in a funhouse mirror. When projecting, another type of anamorphic lens is added to the slightly modified projector to expand the image on the frame horizontally by a factor of two. In this way, we can see a fairly wide picture on the screen. Although the sound and light quality is slightly inferior to the former, since the width of the film used remains unchanged and all equipment does not need to be changed too much, it is simple and easy to implement, so it is suitable for medium and small cinemas. The renovation project of the Capital Cinema adopted this method.

    As for the principle of stereophonic sound, it is also relatively easy to understand. Ordinary films have only one integrated sound track on one side of the picture, which uses photosensitive recording. Since only one microphone is used for recording, only one loudspeaker can be placed behind the screen for sound reproduction. In this way, the sounds from front, back, left and right are artificially squeezed together, just like listening to the radio, so there will naturally be no stereoscopic feeling. The current stereophonic films have three or more magnetic sound tracks. When recording, three or more microphones are used; when reproducing sound, three or more loudspeakers are used behind the widened screen. The other one or several effects sound tracks are emitted from several small speakers installed around and above the auditorium. In this way, the speech of the characters on the screen will be divided into left, center, and right according to the movement or position of the characters; the loud singing will also be from far to near; when expressing battle scenes, there will be a barrage of gunfire throughout the theater, making the audience feel like they are on the battlefield.

    宽银幕立体声电影是怎么回事？
    裘毓忠
    今天，我国的第一座宽银幕立体声电影院在北京开幕了。宽银幕立体声电影的发明，引起了人们极大的兴趣，给电影艺术提供了更加多样的表现方法，加强了它的感染力量。宽银幕立体声电影的银幕，一般要比普通的银幕大到两倍以上。几乎相当于人的视野所及。它的从众多的扬声器中发出的具有立体感的声音，也使你感到真实。当电影院中的灯光熄灭，宽银幕立体声电影开映以后，你仿佛是身临其境了。
    宽银幕立体声电影在世界各国已经迅速地发展起来了。它在类型上大致可分为两大类。一类是用六十五毫米的宽胶片拍摄，或者是用三台摄影机同时拍摄，然后同时放映，使三条三十五毫米宽的影片在银幕上合成一个完整的形象。它的银幕是带弧度的，由一种类似橡胶的材料拼成。这一类型在声光质量方面都很合乎理想，适宜大型或露天电影院采用，但整个制作过程和放映时所需设备都得重新制造，很不经济。另外一种类型是采用变形透镜的。这种变形透镜加在普通的摄影机上，在拍摄时能将三十五毫米底片上的影像，在横向上压缩二倍，成为瘦长状态，就像我们在哈哈镜中所看到的滑稽形像一样。等到放映时，在略加改动后的放映机上，加上另外一种变形透镜，就可以将画幅上的影像在横向上扩大两倍。这样，我们在银幕上就可以看到一幅相当宽广的画面。虽然在声光的质量上略逊于前者，但由于所用之胶片宽度不变，一切设备均不必过多更动，简而易行，所以适宜中小型电影院采用。首都电影院的改建工程，就是采用的这种办法。
    至于立体声的原理，也比较容易了解。普通的影片在画面的一边只有一条利用感光录音的综合声带。由于录音时只用了一个传声器，所以还音时也只能在银幕背后放一个扬声器，这样把前后左右发出的声音都人为地挤在一起，如同从收音机里听广播一样，当然不会有立体的感觉。而现在的立体声电影则有三条以上的磁性声带。录音时，用三个或更多的传声器录音；还音时，在加宽了的银幕后用三个或更多的扬声器还音。另外的一条或几条效果声带，则由装在放映厅四周和顶上的若干小喇叭中发出。这样，银幕上人物的说话自会随着人物的移动或位置的不同有左中右之分；嘹亮的歌声也会由远而近；在表现战斗场面时，也会全场枪炮齐鸣，使观众感到如同身临战场了。（附图片）
