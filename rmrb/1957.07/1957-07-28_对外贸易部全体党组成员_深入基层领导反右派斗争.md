Xinhua News Agency, July 27th -- The leading cadres of the Party Group of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, in the anti-Rightist struggle, have gone deep into the grassroots, specifically helping various units to mobilize the masses and counterattack the Rightists, effectively promoting the development of the struggle.

    For more than a month, the Party Group has regarded leading this struggle as the most important work. All Party members (the Minister and Vice Ministers of Foreign Trade) have gone deep into various departments, bureaus, and companies according to their original scope of business leadership, combining business leadership with the leadership of the anti-Rightist struggle, so that the two aspects of work are comprehensively arranged. The Party Group holds weekly meetings to discuss and study the problems in the struggle. In order to concentrate efforts to solve problems, it has recently started to conduct typical reports at the Party Group meetings, collectively studying the problems of a certain Rightist element. This specific and in-depth approach has had very good results.

    Under the leadership of the Party Group, leading cadres of units affiliated to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, such as the Food Export Company, the Transportation Machinery Import Company, and the China National Import and Export Corporation, have universally carried out in-depth and meticulous work to mobilize the masses. They have talked separately with some cadres in their respective units who have a relatively vague understanding of the movement or have concerns, affirming the correct parts of their statements, criticizing the erroneous ones, and at the same time distinguishing their statements from those of the Rightist elements, enabling these people to raise their understanding, eliminate their concerns, and actively participate in the anti-Rightist struggle. Some company leaders have held such talks with fifty or sixty staff members, which has greatly moved many staff members.

    After the leading cadres of the Ministry of Foreign Trade went deep into the grassroots for specific leadership, they discovered problems in the struggle to criticize the Rightists and promptly put forward solutions. For example, recently they found that in the previous stage of the struggle to reason with the Rightist elements, due to the masses' insufficient understanding of the situation and the limitations of their level of understanding, some of the rebuttals were not systematic or powerful enough to hit the key points of the Rightist remarks. Therefore, they are preparing to hold nine consecutive report meetings from late July to August, where several leading cadres of the Ministry will make reports to Party members, League members, and activists, addressing some common problems of the Rightist elements' attacks on the Party. On the 26th, Vice Minister Li Zheren reported on the difference between "socialist democracy and capitalist democracy." While resolutely leading the anti-Rightist struggle, the Party Group of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is conscientiously starting to improve the shortcomings in its work. For example, more than 100 specific problems related to business work have been improved. The issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has already undergone a universal review, and inappropriate conclusions that were either too heavy or too light have been corrected. There have been even more improvements in living welfare, such as leading cadres with more housing giving up their houses; unreasonable subsidies have been returned; some Party member cadres have voluntarily lowered their ranks and salaries; and many of the unreasonable regulations regarding the living treatment of the leading cadres of the Ministry have also been improved.

### 对外贸易部全体党组成员  深入基层领导反右派斗争

    对外贸易部全体党组成员
    深入基层领导反右派斗争
    据新华社27日讯　对外贸易部党组的领导干部在反右派斗争中，深入基层，具体帮助各单位发动群众，反击右派，有力地推动了斗争的开展。
    一个多月来，党组把领导这一斗争当作最主要的工作，所有的党组成员（对外贸易部部长和副部长）都按自己原来领导的业务范围分工深入到各司、局和公司，把业务领导和反右派斗争的领导结合起来，使两方面的工作得到统筹安排。党组每周举行会议讨论研究斗争中的问题。为了集中力量解决问题，最近又开始在党组会上进行典型汇报，集体研究某一个右派分子的问题。这样具体深入，效果很好。
    在党组的领导下，对外贸易部所属的食品出口公司、运输机械进口公司、中国进出口公司等单位的领导干部普遍地进行了深入细致的发动群众的工作。他们分别和本单位的一些对运动认识比较模糊或者有顾虑的干部进行交谈，把他们言论中正确的部分肯定下来，错误的进行批评，同时把他们的言论和右派分子的言论划清，使这些人提高了认识，解除了顾虑，积极地投入了反右派斗争。有的公司的领导干部和五、六十个工作人员进行了这样的谈话，使许多工作人员十分感动。
    对外贸易部的领导干部在深入基层具体领导后，发现了批判右派斗争中的问题及时提出了解决办法。例如最近他们发现前一阶段对右派分子的说理斗争，由于群众对情况了解得不够和认识水平的限制，有的反驳的言论就不够系统、有力，不能击中右派言论的要害，因此他们就准备在7月下旬至8月份内，连续举行九次报告会，由部里的几位领导干部针对着右派分子向党进攻的一些共同性的问题分别向党团员、积极分子做报告。26日副部长李哲人就报告了“社会主义民主和资本主义民主”的区别问题。对外贸易部党组在坚决领导反右派斗争的同时，认真着手改进工作中的缺点，如有关业务工作上的具体问题已改进了一百多项：肃反问题已经进行了一次普遍的复查，对个别过重或过轻的不恰当的结论，作了改正。生活福利上的改进更多，如住房较多的领导干部腾出了房子；退出了不合理的补助费；有的党员干部自动降级降薪；部的领导干部的一些生活待遇上的不合理的规定也大都作了改进。
