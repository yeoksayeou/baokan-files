Is There Confidence in Completing the Plan?
Commentator of This Newspaper

More than half of 1957 has passed, and the autumn harvest is only two or three months away. Every agricultural cooperative needs to examine the implementation of this year's production and financial plans to see: How much of the plan to increase production and income has been achieved? Is it possible to achieve it all? Based on current conditions, can some items or numbers be added? Are there any wasteful expenditures in the cooperative? Are there still funds that can be used to strive for more production? Is there confidence in ensuring that the vast majority of members increase their income? If some members may have reduced income, how should this be remedied as soon as possible?

Such an examination is very beneficial. First of all, it can give people a clear understanding of the situation. After the examination, if the plan is being implemented well, then continue to work hard and strive to overfulfill the plan; if the plan is not being implemented well, find out the reasons, mobilize the masses to find ways to tap potential, and strive to increase production and income to make up for the shortcomings in the past implementation of the plan. It is still possible to do so. Shexian County in Hebei Province recently launched a "universal inspection of production plans in every township and cooperative," which not only promoted agricultural cooperatives to actively revise their production increase measures for the second half of the year, but also greatly enhanced the production increase confidence and enthusiasm of the vast number of cooperative members. Other agricultural cooperatives can also do this.

Some people think that cooperative members are most concerned about their work points and do not care much about the cooperative's plan. That's wrong. In fact, cooperative members care about both their work points and the cooperative's plan. When the agricultural cooperative announced the cooperative's plan at the beginning of the year, many cooperative members also privately made their own small plans: based on the estimated remuneration for each workday announced by the cooperative, they calculated how many workdays they could contribute throughout the year and how much income they might have. Many agricultural cooperatives also helped each household of members to make a one-year plan, writing each item on a form called "Knowing Everything a Year in Advance." Cooperative members actually linked the cooperative's big plan closely with their own small plans. Therefore, as the harvest days get closer and closer, cooperative members naturally become more and more concerned about the extent to which the cooperative's plan can be realized. If something happens to the agricultural cooperative's production (such as a disaster), their mood is more likely to fluctuate. At this time, if the agricultural cooperative does not inspect the plan and study countermeasures, the cooperative members will become centrifugal, disappointed in the agricultural cooperative, and find their own ways to increase income. This spring, the Yuanxi Township Agricultural Cooperative in Youxi County, Fujian Province, suffered a disaster, and only 43% of the planned wheat production was completed on 137 mu. Some cooperative members worried that the annual production plan could not be realized, and their income would be reduced at the end of the year, so they went out to engage in their own sideline businesses, and the enthusiasm of those who stayed behind was not great; later, the Yuanxi Township Party Branch and the cooperative management committee studied ways to remedy the losses of the previous season's production reduction. After discussing with the cooperative members, they decided that each labor force should accumulate an average of seven loads of fertilizer and increase production by 80 jin of grain, and the cooperative's 102 labor forces could increase production by more than 8,100 jin of grain; they required each production team to expand the planting of 34,000 sweet potato seedlings and expand the planting of 8 mu of millet in addition to completing the contracted production plan; these three items could increase production by more than 12,900 jin of grain, exceeding the wheat production reduction by more than 5,000 jin. These production increase measures were supported by all cooperative members. After inspecting the plan, the cooperative increased the topdressing of early rice; more than 1,400 loads of base fertilizer were also applied to 398 mu of late rice fields that were originally planned to not receive base fertilizer. The cooperative members' confidence in striving for a bumper autumn harvest has also increased.

Being good at using positive and reliable plans to encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses and to guide the production activities of agricultural cooperatives is an important leadership art. This year, many agricultural cooperatives have learned from the lesson of excessively high production increase targets last year, and their production plans are generally more realistic, which is good. However, plans are not only for people to see. No matter how good a plan is, if it is not frequently brought to the attention of the masses, let the masses check it regularly, and implement it with a clear understanding, it will still be in danger of falling through. It is hoped that all agricultural cooperatives will take advantage of the fact that there is still much to be done in striving for increased production in the fields, quickly take the production plan out of the drawers and cabinets, hand it over to all the cadres and members of the cooperative, give play to everyone's wisdom and enthusiasm, and do everything possible to strive for the complete realization of the plan and the overfulfillment of the plan. Agricultural cooperatives that have formulated "Knowing Everything a Year in Advance" forms for each household of cooperative members should also combine the inspection of the cooperative's plan with the inspection of each household's form (that is, each household's small plan), which will make this inspection more effective.

    完成计划有把握吗？
    本报评论员
    1957年过去大半年了，离秋收也不过两三个月。每一个农业社都有必要把今年的生产计划和财务计划的执行情况检查一下，看看：增加生产增加收入的计划已经实现了多少？有没有可能全部实现？根据目前的条件还能不能增添一些项目或数目？社里的开支有没有浪费的地方？还有没有资金可以用于争取更多增产？保证绝大多数社员增加收入有没有把握？如果有一部分社员可能减少收入应该怎样及早补救？
    这样的检查很有好处，首先可以使人们心中有数。经过检查，计划执行情况好的，就再接再厉，争取超额完成计划；计划执行情况不好的，就找出原因，发动社员群众想办法挖潜力，努力增加生产，增加收入，弥补过去执行计划中的不足，也还是来得及的。河北省涉县最近开展了“乡乡社社生产计划普遍大检查”，不但推动农业社积极增订了下半年的增产措施，而且大大提高了广大社员的增产信心和积极性。别的农业社也可以这样做。
    有人以为，社员们最关心自己的工分，而不大关心社里的计划。错了。其实，社员们既关心自己的工分，也关心社里的计划。当农业社年初宣布社里的计划的时候，许多社员私下里也订了自己的小计划：根据社里宣布的每个劳动日的预计报酬，来计算计算自己全年能出多少工，可能有多少收入。有不少农业社还帮助各户社员订了一年的计划，逐项写在叫做“一年早知道”的表格上。社员们实际上是把社里的大计划同自己的小计划紧紧地连在一起看的。因此，离收获的日子越来越近的时候，社员们自然也就越来越关心社里的计划究竟能实现到什么程度。假如农业社的生产发生了什么变故（例如受灾），他们的心情就更容易波动。这时候，如果农业社不来检查计划，研究对策，社员们就会发生离心力，对农业社失望，自行寻找增加收入的出路。福建省尤溪县园溪乡农业社今春受灾，一百三十七亩小麦只完成计划产量的43％。有些社员愁全年生产计划不能实现，年终会减少收入，就出去搞自己的副业，留下的人生产劲头也不大；后来，园溪乡党支部和社管理委员研究补救前季减产损失的办法，经过同社员商量，决定每个劳动力平均增积七担肥料，增产八十斤粮食，全社一百零二个劳动力可以增产八千一百多斤粮食；要求各个生产队在完成包产计划之外扩种三万四千株甘薯，扩种八亩稷子；这三项共可增产一万二千九百多斤粮食，超过小麦减产部分五千多斤。这些增产措施受到全体社员的拥护。检查计划以后，全社增加了早稻的追肥；原计划不下底肥的三百九十八亩晚稻田，也下了一千四百多担底肥。社员们争取秋季大丰收的信心也增加了。
    善于用积极而可靠的计划去鼓舞群众的生产积极性，去指导农业社的生产活动，这是一种重要的领导艺术。今年许多农业社接受了去年计划增产指标过高的教训，生产计划一般都订得比较接近实际，这是好的。但是，计划不光是为了给人看的。不管多么好的计划，如果不使它经常同群众见面，让群众经常来检查，并且心中有数地去执行，它仍然会有落空的危险。希望各个农业社趁着现在争取田间增产还大有可为的时候，赶快把生产计划从抽屉里和柜子里拿出来，交给全社的干部和群众，发挥大家的智慧和积极性，千方百计地争取完满地实现计划和超额完成计划。曾经为各户社员制订了“一年早知道”表格的农业社，还应该把社里的计划的检查同各户的表格（即各户的小计划）的检查结合起来，这样会使这次检查得到更好的效果。
