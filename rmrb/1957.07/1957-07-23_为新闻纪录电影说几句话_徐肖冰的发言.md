Title: A Few Words for News Documentary Films - Xu Xiaobing's Speech

I express my heartfelt support for Premier Zhou’s "Government Work Report" and all other reports. I am willing to strive to achieve the various resolutions of this conference. Here, I would like to express some opinions on several issues related to the film industry.

We have already achieved significant results, and we will work hard to overcome shortcomings and continue to move forward.

Shortly after Wenhui Bao initiated the discussion "Why are there so few good domestic films?" an article titled "The Gongs and Drums of Film" appeared in Beijing Wenyi Bao, written by the newspaper's commentator. Around that time, fallacies such as: New China's film industry has no achievements; the Party's control over film work is too strict and too much; the policy of "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers" is too narrow; the lives and well-being of film practitioners are not guaranteed; box office value is not as good as before liberation; the film industry should take a few steps backward, etc. were abundant and gained relatively widespread dissemination.

Is it true that New China's films are artistically and technically inferior to those of the past? Is it true that the policy of "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers" stifled creative freedom and damaged the breadth and diversity of subject matter? Is it true that our film workers are all without a way out and have bleak prospects? Is the path of socialist realism we have taken a wrong path? Are the ideological and artistic levels achieved by films such as "Millions of Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River," "Moving Mountains and Filling Seas," "Guilin Landscape," "The White-Haired Girl," "Dong Cunrui," "Shangganling," "The New Year's Sacrifice," etc. made after liberation all inferior to domestic films before liberation? At that time, it seemed that all such questions were about to be answered in the negative. This was truly a puzzling and strange thing. However, not long after, the newspapers exposed the conspiracies of certain right-wing elements, and the truth came to light. It turned out that Wenhui Bao was Luo Longji's mouthpiece. Right-wing elements chose certain people and events in the Shanghai film industry and used them to attack the Party's leadership in the film industry, regardless of the facts. They attempted to achieve the goal of occupying the film front by undermining the Party's prestige and role, so as to change the status of the working people on the screen and pull socialist films onto the capitalist track. Look, what a great conspiracy this is! Thanks to the timely and forceful counterattack by many of our film workers against Wenhui Bao's slander and the refutation of the fallacies of the commentator of Wenyi Bao and Zhu Zhuzhu and others, the right-wing elements did not succeed in the film industry. I think this was a rigorous test for the entire film industry, and we should draw profound lessons from it.

Everyone who has struggled through the old society's film industry will clearly remember how much political oppression the Kuomintang reactionaries imposed on us, and how brutally the capitalists exploited our blood and sweat. In that sinful era, what was the difference between people and commodities? What guarantees did we have for our lives and work? How many of our colleagues were persecuted and humiliated? Is it necessary to recount these painful experiences one by one? We should have a deeper understanding of the Party's kindness, the superiority of socialism, and the correctness of "serving workers, peasants, and soldiers" than the younger generation. We should cherish all this even more and be proud of it. Because the facts show that we and our labor truly become the treasures of the motherland only in the new society.

It is impossible to obliterate the Party's achievements in leading the film industry. Even before liberation, China's progressive film workers had already accepted the Party's influence and leadership. This made it possible to produce progressive films that were different from the then-pornographic films and deeply loved by the people. After liberation, the film industry grew stronger under the direct leadership of the Party and the government. The role it plays in the socialist transformation and construction, and the position it occupies in people's cultural life, are extremely significant. In 1956, the national film audience reached 1.39 billion. Although, calculated on the basis of the national population of 600 million, each person averages only a little more than twice a year, it is hundreds of times more than before liberation. Isn't this a remarkable thing?

Of course, we must humbly consider and accept sincere criticisms and suggestions from all sides. Because there are still many shortcomings and errors in all aspects of the film industry. Recently, I conducted an inspection of several aspects of the news documentary film industry. In recent years, its progress has been great, but there are also many problems. First of all, the artistic and technical quality of news documentary films is still very low, and the audience has criticized this more than once. This is one of the major problems that must be faced squarely.

I think the main reason why the quality of films cannot be improved quickly is that we who do leadership work do not have a strong enough sense of responsibility for the cause. Because of this, we do not care enough about the training and education of our subordinates, and we do not help enough. We have not criticized and abolished the restrictive rules and regulations that stifle creative enthusiasm thoroughly enough. We do not understand the laws of film art thoroughly enough. And therefore, we have not guided the cause well towards prosperity, and we have not satisfied the audience. In addition, the poor quality of films is also greatly related to our creative cadres themselves. It is undeniable that at present, some creative cadres are developing ideas that neglect politics, neglect the transformation of intellectuals, and even disrespect the Party's leadership. Therefore, phenomena such as freedom, looseness, separation from the masses, separation from life, pretending to understand when they don't, and being self-important exist among them. As a result, they often put personal fame and gain in the primary position and ignore the ideological, artistic, and combative nature of the films, and also seriously hinder themselves from obtaining more rapid improvement in their thinking and business. Under the influence of the negative factors existing in both the leadership and the led, some of our films are often not substantial in content, not perfect in form, easy to fall into the quagmire of formulaic conceptualization, and lose their touching artistic charm. This shortcoming must be vigorously overcome.

News documentaries have a wide audience.

It is worth emphasizing how all parties related to the news documentary film industry value this cause. Because as far as the current situation is concerned, news documentary films have not received the due attention from all parties, which has greatly hindered its further development.

One of the reasons for this situation is that people seem to be wondering whether news documentary films (as well as science education films) are popular. The facts show that it has a wide audience. Take the situation of Tianjin News Cinema as an example:

Comparison Table of Audience Numbers and Profits Paid by Tianjin News Cinema from 1954 to 1957 (with 1954 as 100)
	1954	1955	1956	1957
Audience Numbers	100	106	128	161
Profits Paid	100	95	138	177

This phenomenon is not accidental. Because it is basically the same in other places. For example, the Red Star Cinema in Beijing was a news cinema before last November. In the first four months of last year, the average audience per show of art films in Beijing was 411, while the Red Star Cinema reached 412. In the whole year of last year, the average number of seats in art film cinemas of the same level in Beijing was 846, and the news cinema had 680. Assuming that they are regarded as equal, the audience number of the news cinema is 1.2 times the average number of art film cinemas of the same level. This gratifying phenomenon proves that this kind of film is an indispensable thing in people's cultural life. Unfortunately, this point has not attracted the attention of all parties, but has been met with indifference and discrimination to a certain extent:

Canceling news cinemas in Shanghai and Beijing is a misstep.

First, some local cultural bureaus do not pay attention to the establishment of news cinemas, and some even canceled those that have already been established. For example, Shanghai City, put the news cinema in a remote and deserted place. Even so, the average audience per show in 1955 reached about 600 people. It declined slightly last year, but this year it not only restored the highest indicators in the past, but also developed solidly. According to common sense, it should receive the attention and encouragement of the leadership, but on the contrary, in May of this year, it was transferred by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture to the Film Actors Troupe to perform dramas. The Bureau of Culture neither consulted with the cinema beforehand, nor arranged the outlet for news documentary and science education films that were to be screened in the cinema afterwards.

Speaking of Beijing, this is the leading political and cultural metropolis in our country, and there is not even a news cinema at present. The original one was canceled by the Beijing Municipal People's Committee last November and changed to screen art films, just showing news documentaries in special screenings. The reason given was that the voters in Dongdan District had the following opinions:

1.	The Red Star Cinema specializes in showing documentaries to serve the whole city. This deprives the masses in Dongdan District of a place to watch feature films, thus failing to meet the increasingly high demand of the people for cultural life.

2.	After the Red Star Cinema specializes in showing documentaries, people from other districts who want to watch documentaries have to travel a long distance, saying that the masses waste time and fares, which is not in line with the principle of facilitating the masses.

3.	Although the Red Star Cinema is sometimes crowded when showing documentaries, this does not mean that the masses need a professional cinema showing documentaries. In fact, they passively watch "one mao (10 cents)" (the masses' name for documentaries) because they cannot see other films.

I believe that some citizens in Dongdan District may have this or that dissatisfaction with news documentary films, but I am afraid that they cannot represent the opinions of all voters in Dongdan District, let alone reflect the opinions of all residents in Beijing. The correctness of these opinions is worth questioning and considering.

The consequence of the Red Star Cinema changing to screen art films is that the number of screenings and audience of news documentary films in Beijing has dropped significantly:

Comparison Table of the Screening Situation of News Documentary Films in Beijing Before and After the Abolition of News Cinema
	January-April 1956	January-April 1957	1957 is % of 1956
Number of Screenings	900	659	73.2
Audience Number	372,063	228,052	61.3

In a country as vast as ours with a large population, there were originally only 13 news cinemas. Now, not only are they not actively creating new ones, but two have been cancelled, and these two happen to be located in the two largest and most famous cities in our country. This cannot but be said to be a phenomenon that is difficult to understand. It can be said with certainty that the Shanghai and Beijing Cultural Bureaus canceled news cinemas without reason, which not only directly affects the development of the news documentary film industry, but also lacks a mass perspective.

Why can't many areas see news documentaries?

Second, the number of distribution copies of news documentary films is too small. The number last year was not large, but this year it is not as good as last year. However, the number of 35mm film screening units nationwide has increased significantly this year compared to last year. The situation is shown in the following table:

Comparison Table of Screening Units and Product Copy Volume in 1957 and 1956
		1956	1957	1957 is % of 1956
Number of 35mm Screening Units	1,827	2,485	130
Average Number of Copies per Issue of News Bulletin	98	94	96
Average Number of Copies per Issue of Sports Bulletin	38	30	79
Average Number of Copies per Issue of Young Pioneers	37	30	81
Average Number of Copies per Film of Black and White Short Documentary	46	28	61

This is abnormal. What is the reason? Some people believe that it is caused by the shortage of film due to the tightening of foreign exchange. This is a fact, but it is not the key to the problem. Excluding long documentaries, the planned output of black and white news documentary films of the Central News Documentary Film Studio this year is 77% of the actual output last year. However, the percentage of the planned output of black and white copies directly proposed to the factory by the China Film Distribution Company compared with the actual output last year was first 98%, then reduced to 94% after a few months, and then reduced to 75% after half a year. After one reduction after another, judging from the reduction rate of film and copy output, the insufficient supply of film is still not the main reason for reducing orders. Obviously, the main problem lies not in the supply of film, but in the distribution company's view of the news documentary film industry, and in the film distribution policy.

The inevitable consequence of the small number of film distribution copies is that the distribution surface of news documentary films is narrow, otherwise, it can only be compensated for by seriously damaging the timeliness of distribution (which is the life of this kind of film) and reducing the quality of screening at a great cost. I investigated the distribution areas of the six recently produced news documentary films as follows:

Film Name	Number of Copies	Number of Provinces and Cities with Copies Distributed	Number of Provinces and Cities without Copies Distributed
The Five-Nation Trip	16	15	13
Premier Zhou's Visit to Hungary	24	14	9
Visiting Relatives from Afar	16	12	16
Public Secret	22	17	11
Ten Years of Inner Mongolia	8	8	20
The New Life of Dachen Island	6	6	22

The above table shows that vast areas of our country cannot see news documentary films or can only see them very late. This is directly detrimental to the audience.

It is unreasonable that news films do not pay attention to timeliness.

Third, the timeliness of distribution is very poor. News documentaries are valuable for their prompt screening, but there are serious problems in this regard at present. First of all, the Central News Documentary Film Studio is very slow in producing distribution copies of news magazine films. Taking the "News Bulletin" issued every five days as an example, 80% of the copies in the first half of 1955 were distributed within 10 days after the film was completed. This year, the opposite is true, 80% are distributed after 11 days. This phenomenon must be vigorously corrected. In addition, the film studio also seriously delays in providing film materials for reducing 16mm copies. I investigated 22 news magazine films and 20 short documentaries. According to the delivery date proposed by the China Film Distribution Company, the situation is as follows:

		News Magazine Films	Black and White Short Documentaries
		Number	%	Number	%
Total	22	100	20	100
Delivered in Advance or on Schedule	11	50	5	25
Delivered Late	11	50	15	75

The delay is up to 232 days. This situation cannot but seriously affect the work of reducing 16mm copies.

In addition to the above point, I think the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and the China Film Distribution Company should also bear great responsibility for the poor timeliness of film distribution. The company often delays in formulating orders for some documentary copies. In the past, when the power of film censorship had not been decentralized, the failure of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture to issue film censorship approval orders in time was one of the reasons for delaying copy orders.

According to the inspection of the 12 black and white short documentaries completed from January to April this year, it was found that only half of the copy orders were submitted within 10 days after the film was approved for censorship. The ordering of materials for reduction is also the case, and even more serious. Judging from the situation of the 12 news films and 17 short documentaries I investigated, it takes 4 to 6 months from the film being approved for censorship to being reduced into 16mm copies for the former, and most of the latter takes more than 6 months. As for when it will be delivered to the audience, it is even more difficult to imagine. It can be seen from this the timeliness of distribution.

What is particularly worth mentioning here is the national language translation film. There are very few copies of this type of film, and the timeliness of distribution is particularly poor. According to the survey results, the time from the film being approved for censorship to being translated and reduced into a 16mm copy is at least one year and at most three years. This is really outrageous, but the fact is exactly like this. For example, the short film "The First Step in Transforming the Yellow River" was released at the end of January 1955. As of the end of May this year, there were still no Uyghur and Tibetan versions of the reduction materials submitted, and it is currently impossible to predict when the copies will be released. In addition, the copy volume of national language translation documentaries is generally 5 copies each for the Uyghur and Mongolian versions, and 6 copies for the Tibetan version. Compared with the particularly large areas where minority nationalities live, this is really disproportionate.

The above situations are sufficient to illustrate the shortcomings in the work of the Central Film Administration Bureau, which directly leads my country's film industry. How should the production and distribution of news documentary films adapt? How should the timeliness of its production and distribution be strengthened? Issues such as how to pay attention to the translation of minority languages were not sufficiently studied in the past. I hope that the Film Bureau will carefully consider it and make appropriate arrangements. At the same time, I hope that science education films also need to be given due attention, because as far as I know, it is basically in a similar position to news documentary films, and there are also many difficulties.

I take this opportunity to request the Ministry of Culture, the Film Bureau, the cultural bureaus of various provinces and cities, and the cultural and educational departments in the trade union system: Pay attention to the current situation and development of news documentary films and science education films; conduct a relatively comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth inspection of the work in this area at present. If there are indeed shortcomings and errors, they should be overcome in a timely and effective manner. Please support us and supervise us as much as possible within your ability, because this cause was established not long ago and has a weak foundation, and it needs support and care from all sides. I firmly believe that our news documentary film workers and film workers across the country, after the rectification movement and the struggle against right-wing elements, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, and with the help of the broad masses of people, will be able to more deeply appreciate the importance of knowing one's mistakes and correcting them, and hating evil like an enemy, and will be able to confidently lead my country's news documentary films and the entire film industry to a higher level.

### 为新闻纪录电影说几句话  徐肖冰的发言

    为新闻纪录电影说几句话
    徐肖冰的发言
    我对周总理的“政府工作报告”及其他各项报告表示衷心的拥护。我愿为实现这次大会的各项决议而奋斗。在这里，我想就有关电影事业的几个问题发表一些意见。
    我们已经有了显著成绩，我们还将努力克服缺点继续前进
    去年文汇报发起“为什么好的国产影片这样少”的讨论后不久，北京文艺报出现一篇由该报评论员所写，题为“电影的锣鼓”的文章。在这前后，新中国的电影事业没有成绩；党对电影工作管得太死、太多；“为工农兵服务”的方针太狭隘；电影从业员的生活和生命没有保障；票房价值不如解放以前；电影事业应向后退几步等等谬论不一而足，并获得比较广泛的传播。
    是不是新中国的电影在艺术上、技术上都不如过去呢？是不是“为工农兵服务”的方针扼杀了创作的自由、损害了题材的广泛和多样？是不是我国的电影工作者都是那样地没有出路和前途暗淡无光？我们所走的社会主义现实主义的道路是不是一条错路？解放以后所摄制的影片“百万雄师下江南”、“移山填海”、“桂林山水”、“白毛女”、“董存瑞”、“上甘岭”、“祝福”等等思想上、艺术上所达到的水平是不是都不如解放前的国产影片？诸如此类的问题在那个时候仿佛都要作否定的回答。这真是一桩令人费解的怪事。但过不多久，报上揭发了某些右派分子的阴谋，遂使真相大白。原来文汇报是罗隆基的喉舌。右派分子选中了上海电影界的某些人和事不顾事实地用以攻击党在电影界的领导。他们以破坏党的威信和作用为手段，企图达到占领电影阵地的目的，以便就此改变劳动人民在银幕上的地位，把社会主义的电影拉上资本主义的轨道。请看，这是多大的阴谋！由于我们许多电影工作者及时而有力地回击了文汇报的诽谤，驳斥了文艺报评论员及朱煮竹之流的谬论，右派分子在电影界并未得逞。我觉得这对于整个电影界来说，是一次严格的考验，我们应该从这里得出深刻的经验教训。
    每一个从旧社会电影界里挣扎过来的人，都会清楚地记得：解放前，国民党反动派对我们施加了多少政治上的压迫，资本家对我们的血汗进行了何等惨重的剥削；在那个罪恶的时代里，人和商品有何区别？我们的生活和工作有什么保障？我们有多少同行被迫害和污辱了。这种可痛的经历还用得着逐一数述吗？我们应该比年轻一代更加深刻地体会到党的亲切、社会主义的优越和“为工农兵服务”的正确。我们应该更加珍重这一切，并以此自豪。因为事实说明，我们和我们的劳动只有在新社会才真正成为祖国的财宝。
    企图抹煞党领导电影事业的功绩是不可能的。即使在解放以前，我国的进步电影工作者就已经接受了党的影响和领导；这就是有可能制作出区别于当时的黄色电影并深得人民喜爱的进步电影。解放以后，电影事业在党和政府的直接领导下壮大起来。它在社会主义改造和建设事业中所起的作用，在人民文化生活中所占的地位，都是极其显著的。一九五六年全国电影观众达十三亿九千万人次。虽然按全国六亿人口计算起来，每人每年平均还只两次多一点，但比之解放以前增加了几百倍。这难道不是一件了不得的大事吗？
    当然，我们必须虚心地考虑和接受来自各方面的真诚的批评和建议。因为电影事业在各方面还都存在不少的缺点和错误。最近我曾就关于新闻纪录电影事业几个方面的情况进行了视察。几年来它的进展是很大的，但问题也不少。首先，新闻纪录影片的艺术、技术质量还很低，观众曾经为此不只一次地提出批评。这是必须正视的重大问题之一。
    我觉得影片质量不能很快提高的主要原因是我们做领导工作的人对于事业的责任心还不够强。由于这一点，我们对下面干部的培养教育问题关怀不够、帮助不够；对束缚创作积极性的清规戒律批判得不够，废除得不彻底；对电影艺术的创作规律摸得不透；而且也因此没有很好地把事业引向繁荣，没有使观众得到满足。此外，影片质量不高和我们的创作干部本身也有很大的关系。不可否认，目前在一些创作干部身上滋长着忽视政治、忽视知识分子改造的思想；甚至不尊重党的领导。因此他们之中存在自由散漫、脱离群众、脱离生活、不懂装懂、自命不凡等现象。其结果往往是把个人的名利放在首要地位而忽视影片的思想性、艺术性和战斗性，并且还严重地妨碍自己在思想上和业务上获得更迅速的提高。在领导和被领导这两方面所存在的消极因素的影响下，我们有些影片往往内容不充实，形式不完美，易于陷入公式化概念化的泥坑，失去感人的艺术魅力。这种缺点必须大力予以克服。
    新闻纪录片拥有广大观众
    值得着重指出的是与新闻纪录电影事业有关的各方面如何重视这一事业的问题。因为就目前的状况来看，新闻纪录电影还未取得各方面应有的重视，这一点已大大地妨碍它作进一步的发展。
    造成这种状况的原因之一是：人们似乎在怀疑新闻纪录电影（还有科学教育电影）是不是受人欢迎。事实说明它是拥有广大观众的，试以天津新闻影院的状况为例：
    1954—1957年天津市新闻影院观众人次上缴利润比较表（以1954年为100）
          1954年　  1955年  　1956年　  1957年观众人次　100　      106　      128      161上缴利润　100       　95　      138　    177
    这种现象不是偶然的。因为在别的地方基本上也是如此。比如北京的红星影院，去年十一月前还是新闻影院，去年头四个月北京市艺术片平均每场观众四百一十一人，红星影院则达四百一十二人。去年全年北京市同级艺术片影院平均座位是八百四十六个，新闻影院六百八十个，假定把它们看成相等，则新闻影院的观众人次是同级艺术片影院平均人次的一点二倍。这种可喜的现象证明着这种影片是人民文化生活中不可缺少的东西。可惜这一点并未引起各方面的重视，反而在一定程度上遭到冷淡和歧视：
    上海北京取消新闻影院是失策的
    第一是有些地方的文化局对设立新闻影院一事还不重视，有的甚至把已经设立起来的取消了。比如上海市，把新闻影院设在一个偏僻而又冷落的地方。即使如此，一九五五年平均每场观众亦达六百人左右，去年稍有下降，今年不但恢复过去最高指标而且巩固地发展着。按常情来说，它应该得到领导上的重视与鼓励，但恰恰相反，今年5月里它被上海市文化局移交给电影演员剧团改演话剧了。事先文化局既未和影院商量，事后也未安排在该院上映的新闻纪录片和科学教育片的出路。
    再说北京，这是我国首屈一指的政治和文化的都会，目前连一个新闻影院都没有。原有的一个已于去年十一月被北京市人民委员会取消了，改映艺术片，只是带便专场放映新闻纪录片。理由据说是东单区选民们有如下的意见：
    ⒈红星影院专放纪录片是为全市服务的，这使东单区群众少了一个看故事片的场所，因而使愈来愈高涨的人民对文化生活的需要得不到满足。
    ⒉红星影院专放纪录片后，其他区想看纪录片的人要远路跑来，说群众浪费时间、车费，不符便利群众的方针。
    ⒊虽然红星放映纪录片也有时拥挤，但这并不能说明群众需要放映纪录片的专业影院，实际上是看不到其他影片被动地看“一毛钱”（群众对纪录片的称呼）。
    我相信在东单区有些公民，对新闻纪录片可能有这样或那样的不满情绪，但恐怕不能代表全东单区选民的意见，更不能反映全北京市居民的意见。这些意见的正确性是值得怀疑，值得斟酌的。
    红星改映艺术片后的后果是北京市新闻纪录影片的放映场数和观众人次有显著降落：
    新闻影院撤销前后新闻纪录影片在北京市上映情况比较表
            1956年  　1957年　  1957年是
            1—4月　   1—4月　   1956年的％放映场数　   900       　659     　73.2观众人次　   372，063  　228，052　61.3
    像我们这样地广人多的国家，新闻影院原只十三座，现在不但没有积极创设，反被取消了两座，而且这两座恰巧座落在我国最大的两座名著全球的都市里，这不能不说是一种使人难以理解的现象，肯定地说上海市和北京市文化局无故取消新闻影院，不仅直接影响新闻纪录电影事业的发展，而且是缺乏群众观点的。
  为什么很多地区看不到新闻纪录片
    第二是新闻纪录片发行拷贝数量太小。去年的数量并不大，今年却不如去年。但全国三十五毫米影片的放映单位今年比去年有显著的增加，情况如下表所示：1957年和1956年放映单位与产品拷贝量比较表
                1956年　  1957年　  1957年是
                                     1956年的％35毫米放映单位数 1，827  　2，485　  130新闻简报每号
  平均拷贝数　    98　      94　      96体育简报每号
  平均拷贝数　    38　      30　      79少先队每号平
  均拷贝数　      37　      30　      81黑白短纪录片每
  部平均拷贝数　  46　      28        61
    这是不正常的。原因何在呢？有人认为由于外汇紧缩，胶片不够造成。这是事实，但不是问题关键。除去长纪录片，今年中央新闻纪录电影制片厂黑白新闻纪录影片的计划产量是去年实际产量的百分之七十七，但由中国电影发行公司直接向该厂提出的黑白拷贝计划产量与去年实际产量的百分比先是百分之九十八，过了几个月减为百分之九十四，过了半年再减为百分之七十五。一减再减以后，从影片和拷贝的产量降低率来看，胶片供应不足仍然不是减少定货的主要理由。显然，主要的问题不在于胶片供应而在于发行公司对于新闻纪录电影事业的看法，在于影片的发行方针。
    影片发行拷贝量小的必然后果是新闻纪录片的发行面窄，不然只能用严重地损害发行时间性（这正是这种影片的生命）和降低放映质量的重大代价来弥补这个缺陷。我调查了最近制成的六部新闻纪录影片的发行区域如下：
    片　名  　拷贝数　  分到拷贝　  未分到拷贝
                        的省市数   　的省市数五国之行　       16　         15      　13周总理访问匈牙利 24　         14         9千里迢迢探亲人　 16　         12　       16公开的秘密       22         　17　       11内蒙十年　       8　           8       　20大陈岛的新生　   6　           6　       22
    上表说明我国广大地区看不到或很晚才能看到新闻纪录影片。这一点直接不利于观众。
    新闻片不讲求时间性太不合理
    第三是发行的时间性很差。新闻纪录片贵在迅速上映，但目前这一方面存在严重的问题。首先是中央新闻纪录电影制片厂对新闻杂志片的发行拷贝制作很慢。以五天一号的“新闻简报”为例，一九五五年上半年百分之八十的拷贝在该片完成后十天以内发齐，今年则相反，百分之八十在十一天以后发齐。这种现象是必须大力纠正的。此外，制片厂在提供缩制十六毫米拷贝的影片素材上也严重地存在拖延现象。我调查了二十二部新闻杂志片及二十部短纪录片，按照中国电影发行公司提出的交货日期来检查，情况如下：
              新闻杂志片　黑白短纪录片

    除上述一点外，我认为文化部电影局和中国电影发行公司还应对影片发行的时间性差负很大责任。该公司对有些纪录片拷贝往往拖延制定。过去影片审查权还未下放时，文化部电影局不能及时颁发影片审查通过令，是使拷贝定货拖延时日的原因之一。
    根据对今年一至四月份完成的十二部黑白短纪录片的检查，发现只有半数是在影片被审查通过后十天之内提出拷贝定单。对缩制用素材的定货也是如此，甚至还要严重些。就我所调查过的十二号新闻片及十七部短纪录片的情况来看，前者从影片审查通过到缩制成十六毫米拷贝要四至六个月，后者大多数要在六个月以上。至于何时送到观众眼前，那就更难设想了。由此可见发行时间性的一斑了。
    这里特别值得提起的是民族语翻译片。这一片种拷贝数量很少，而且发行的时间性尤其差。据调查结果来看，影片从审查通过经过译制到缩制成十六毫米拷贝的时间，短则一年，长则三年。这实在太不像话了，而事实正是如此。如短片“改造黄河第一步”是一九五五年一月底出片的，到今年五月底尚有维语、藏语两版的缩制素材没有交出，何时出拷贝，目前还无法推测。此外民族语翻译纪录片的拷贝量一般说来，维语版、蒙语版各五个，藏语版是六个。这与特别广大的兄弟民族聚居的地域比较起来，实在太不相称。
    以上各种情况足以说明直接领导我国电影事业的中央电影事业管理局在工作上的缺点。新闻纪录片的生产和发行工作应如何适应？它在制作和发行上的时间性应如何加强？少数民族语言的翻译片应如何重视等问题，过去是研究不足的。我希望由电影局慎重地加以考虑，并作出适当的安排。同时我希望对科学教育片也需要予以应有的重视，因为据我了解，它基本上处于和新闻纪录片相似的地位，困难也是很多的。
    我借此机会请求文化部，请求电影局和各省市的文化局，请求工会系统中的文化教育部门：注意到新闻纪录电影和科学教育电影事业的现状和发展；在目前进行一次比较全面地、系统地、深入地检查有关这一方面的工作，如果确实存在缺点和错误，就应该及时而有效地加以克服；请你们在可能范围内，极力地支持我们、监督我们，因为这一事业创立不久，根基薄弱，正需多方的扶持和关怀。我坚决相信：我们新闻纪录电影工作者，全国的电影工作者，通过整风运动和反右派分子的斗争以后，在党和政府的正确领导下，在广大群众的帮助下，是能够更深刻地体会到知过必改、疾恶如仇的重要性的，是能够信心百倍地把我国的新闻纪录电影和整个电影事业引向更高的水平的。
