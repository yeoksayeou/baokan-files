Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 22nd – The Czechoslovak News Agency published on July 21st the communiqué on Chairman Ho Chi Minh's visit to Czechoslovakia.

The communiqué stated that at the invitation of Czechoslovak President Zapotocky, Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam visited Czechoslovakia from July 17th to 21st.

During their stay in Czechoslovakia, Chairman Ho Chi Minh and his entourage visited Prague, Bratislava, and other places, toured some industrial enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, and social institutions, and learned about Czechoslovakia's political, economic, and cultural life. They were warmly received by the Czechoslovak President, government, and people.

During the visit, Chairman Ho Chi Minh held talks with President Zapotocky, First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee Novotny, Premier of the Republic Siroky, and others. These talks were a continuation of the talks held between the Czechoslovak government delegation and the Vietnamese government delegation in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in March this year. The talks touched on the current international situation and issues such as strengthening the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and further consolidating the fraternal ties and cooperation between Czechoslovakia and Vietnam.

The representatives of the two countries affirmed that they share the same views on assessing the development of the current international situation and on the struggle that must continue to be waged to ease international tensions, especially the struggle to achieve comprehensive disarmament, unconditionally ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, and immediately cease testing such weapons.

When exchanging views on the situation in Europe and Southeast Asia, both sides believed that all peace-loving countries must work together to oppose the militarization of West Germany and strive for the implementation of the 1954 Geneva Accords on Vietnam. The representative of the Czechoslovak Republic expressed full support for the demand put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 8, 1957, hoping to take effective measures to implement the Geneva Accords.

The representatives of the two countries were satisfied that the political, economic, and cultural ties between the two countries have developed successfully since the signing of the joint statement by the government delegations of Czechoslovakia and Vietnam on March 20 this year.

The talks were conducted in a spirit of sincerity, friendship, mutual understanding, and complete agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 22nd – Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and his entourage left Prague by plane on July 21st for a visit to Poland after concluding their visit to Czechoslovakia.

On the eve of his departure from Prague, Chairman Ho Chi Minh held a reception. Chairman Ho Chi Minh and President Zapotocky both spoke at the banquet.

In his speech, Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out the importance of the strong unity of the socialist camp, and he also recounted the third anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, which included provisions for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh said that these provisions have been seriously undermined by the American imperialists, who are trying to keep Vietnam divided forever and turn the South into their military base. He emphasized that "the Vietnamese people are firmly determined to fight to the end for the reunification of their motherland."

    越捷双方决定加强兄弟联系和合作
    新华社布拉格22日电　捷克斯洛伐克通讯社21日发表了胡志明主席访问捷克斯洛伐克的公报。
    公报说，越南民主共和国主席胡志明应捷克斯洛伐克总统萨波托斯基的邀请，自7月17日到21日访问了捷克斯洛伐克。
    胡志明主席和他的随行人员在捷克斯洛伐克逗留期间，访问了布拉格、布拉迪斯拉发和其他地方，参观了一些工业企业、农业合作社和社会机构，了解了捷克斯洛伐克的政治、经济和文化生活。他们受到了捷克斯洛伐克总统、政府和人民的热情接待。
    在访问期间，胡志明主席曾经同萨波托斯基总统、捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼、共和国总理西罗基等举行了会谈。这些会谈是捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团和越南政府代表团今年3月间在越南民主共和国举行的会谈的继续。会谈涉及到目前的国际局势，以及加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、进一步巩固捷越两国之间的兄弟联系和合作等问题。
    两国代表确定，他们对估计目前国际局势的发展，对必须继续为缓和国际紧张局势而进行的斗争，特别是为争取全面裁减军备、无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器以及立即停止试验这种武器的斗争的见解是一致的。
    在就欧洲和东南亚的局势交换意见的时候，双方认为一切爱好和平的国家必须共同努力，反对西德军国主义化，争取实现1954年关于越南的日内瓦协议。捷克斯洛伐克共和国的代表表示完全支持越南民主共和国1957年6月8日提出的希望采取有效措施来实现日内瓦协议的要求。
    两国代表满意地认为，自从今年3月20日签署捷越两国政府代表团的联合声明以来，两国的政治、经济和文化联系获得了成功的发展。
    会谈是在真诚、友好、互相谅解和完全一致的情况下进行的。
    据新华社布拉格22日电　越南民主共和国主席胡志明和随行人员，在结束了对捷克斯洛伐克的访问以后，21日乘飞机离开布拉格前往波兰访问。
    在离开布拉格前夕，胡志明主席举行了招待会。胡志明主席和萨波托斯基总统都在宴会上讲了话。
    胡志明主席在讲话中指出了社会主义阵营的坚强的团结的重要性，他还追述了日内瓦协议签订三周年纪念，这个协议中包括有和平统一越南的条款。胡志明说，这些条款遭到了美帝国主义者的严重破坏，他们企图使越南永远分裂下去和把南部变成他们的军事基地。他强调说，“越南人民有坚定的决心为祖国的统一斗争到底。”
