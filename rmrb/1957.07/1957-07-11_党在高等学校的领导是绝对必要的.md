Yang Shixian said: Rightists vainly attempt to seize various national leadership positions by controlling education; this treacherous scheme cannot escape the eyes of the people.

In recent years, the reforms we have carried out in education have played a significant role. If institutions of higher education had not undergone departmental adjustments and teaching reforms, they would not have been able to complete the task of providing the large number of talents urgently needed by the country's economic construction. If primary and secondary schools had not learned from the Soviet Union and expanded and improved, it would have been difficult to meet the ardent desire of the broad masses of people, especially the children of workers and peasants, to receive education. In the seven years from 1949 to 1956, more than 300,000 students who had received professional training graduated from institutions of higher education and worked in many positions. Nationwide, 60 to 70 percent of school-age children (average) are able to attend school. Considering the very weak educational foundation of the past, this cannot be regarded as anything but a miracle. This miracle, like many other miracles, was achieved under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, but rightists insist that the Party cannot lead education, and even advocate that Party committees withdraw from schools! They have ulterior motives. When such absurd remarks appeared in the newspapers in early June, the three democratic parties in Tianjin (China Democratic League, China Association for Promoting Democracy, Jiusan Society) convened dozens of the most prestigious professors from four institutions of higher education to hold a forum to study the leadership system of institutions of higher education. At the meeting, everyone unanimously criticized the rightists' fallacies, unanimously believing that the Party's leadership in institutions of higher education is absolutely necessary, and should not be canceled or weakened, but should be greatly strengthened, and put forward specific suggestions on how to strengthen it. Because education concerns the future destiny of the country, without the Party's ideological leadership and organizational guarantee, the socialist future would be difficult to maintain. Some of the rightists have political ambitions; they vainly attempt to usurp the Party's current political leadership and also vainly attempt to seize various future national leadership positions by controlling education. This treacherous scheme cannot escape the eyes of the people. Intellectuals across the country, especially members of democratic parties, must first draw a clear line with them ideologically and politically, and even more so, vigorously refute them among the masses so that their absurd remarks and fallacies gain no market.

Affirming our achievements in education does not mean that we have not made mistakes in educational reform, nor does it mean that everything is perfect now and does not need improvement. We have made many mistakes in the past, and there are still many shortcomings. During the Great Blooming and Contending and at the beginning of the rectification campaign, the masses put forward many criticisms, and most of them were correct. Party committees at all levels also expressed their acceptance of these correct criticisms and have corrected some items. We cannot stop blooming and contending, or stop criticizing Party organizations and members, because of the erroneous behavior of the rightists. These are two completely different things and should not be confused.

I have worked in institutions of higher education for many years. I would like to report to the conference on the situation I have experienced in one university, and representatives are requested to criticize and correct any incorrect points.

I. Teaching Quality is Constantly Improving

Many people criticize that the teaching quality of institutions of higher education has not been high in recent years, which is a fact. There are many reasons for this, the main ones being: (1) A large number of young and inexperienced teachers are teaching basic and professional courses; (2) There are a large number of students in the class and their levels vary widely, and teachers' energy is often spent on students with very poor levels; (3) The entire set of Soviet teaching system is copied, and a process is needed to understand the content and function well, and another process is needed to combine it with China's reality. Moreover, some of them were not successful experiences in the Soviet Union, so of course everyone's energy and time were wasted. Now the teaching reform has been basically completed. After this arduous process, young teachers have grown up and have more experience. Teaching plans and teaching outlines have been revised as much as possible to adapt to China's current situation. Due to the reduction in enrollment numbers and the increase in high school graduates, the quality of new students has been guaranteed, and the levels in a class will not differ too much. These situations all contribute to the improvement of teaching quality. In addition, we have paid special attention to and vigorously corrected the deviations that have occurred in the past. There are also many such deviations, and some are very serious. For example, one deviation is that students lack independent thinking ability. In the past, students' levels were uneven, and in order to reduce the number of unqualified products from schools, "guaranteed teaching and guaranteed learning" was excessively emphasized, and the responsibility for creating unqualified products was entirely pushed onto teachers. Moreover, the Soviet teaching plan had many courses and heavy hours, and most students could not digest them or even complete them, resulting in a reliance on teachers' thinking. Some students did a large part of their work with the teacher holding their hand. How can students use what they cannot chew and digest themselves! And teachers have done their best, spending several times the time to tutor students. Some students who could have made more efforts to think independently also took the opportunity to lean on the teacher. The losses caused to both sides are very large. In the past two years, we have paid attention to this issue, pointed out its harmfulness to students, and the situation in the class is also different from the past, so correction will not be too difficult.

Another deviation is the incorrect "expert" thinking among students. I am not saying that it is incorrect for students to have the ambition to become experts, but that their understanding of experts and how to achieve them is not correct enough. In the past, we excessively criticized the "general education" of Britain and the United States, emphasized expert thinking, and the majors in the Soviet Union were divided too finely in the past (now corrected). Some students mistakenly ignored basic courses, relaxed certain professional courses, and only paid attention to specialized courses, of course, also because the coursework was too heavy. As a result, the foundation is not solid, the bottom is very small, and what they know is only a little bit on top. This creates difficulties for them in their work after graduation, and it is difficult to match the caliber; even if it is temporarily matched, the future development prospects are not great. Such "experts" are of no benefit to the country or to individuals. Many of us believe that students only spend four or five years in school, and the most important thing is to lay a good foundation for a certain major so that they can continue to move forward on their own after leaving school. Some too specialized things can be left to learn and master in the workplace. This greatly reduces the difficulty of matching the caliber. The successful cultivation of an expert cannot be done by simply taking one or two courses in school in a short period of time.

Another deviation is that students' writing skills are too poor. They often cannot write clearly or fluently when describing things in simple words. They cannot read traditional Chinese books at all. They also do not have the ability to read a foreign language. Obviously, this does not meet the requirements of university students. The Ministry of Education and local education departments (bureaus) should bear a great responsibility for this situation. If it is said that some middle school students do not need these things, then students who aspire to go to university should have the opportunity to take elective courses. Many people have expressed dissatisfaction with this situation, and the Ministry of Education has only recently started to think of ways and take some measures, so that in recent years, the vast majority of university graduates can only hold a few textbooks and lecture notes as the only treasure trove of knowledge, and have no other self-study methods. If foreign language learning relies only on two or three years of training in university, it is not enough. Of course, this situation also exists among young teachers, and it is no wonder that many people worry that there will be a period of time without suitable successors after some old scholars and scientists die. We hope that secondary education and we can quickly change this situation together.

II. The Position of Teaching and Research has been Placed on a Correct Basis

In the past, the Ministry of Higher Education felt that the task of cultivating talents for national construction was very heavy and arduous, and emphasized the teaching aspect, which was necessary to vigorously carry out teaching reform in the early days of the founding of the country. After the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union returned to China, it was made clear that both are the normal tasks of institutions of higher education, and they are complementary to each other and should not be biased. Some people from the Ministry of Higher Education participated in the delegation. At the same time, foreign higher education personnel visiting China, such as the Minister of Higher Education of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet chief advisor to the State Council, also repeatedly pointed out the importance of developing research. The Ministry of Higher Education was slow to make arrangements, which disappointed many old scientists in institutions of higher education, resulting in the phenomenon of "people's hearts toward the Academy (of Sciences)". It was not until the end of the year before last that the Party put forward the slogan of marching toward science that a change began to take place. It was not until this spring that the higher education delegation to the Soviet Union realized that it must be actively promoted. Now, the Science Planning Commission of the State Council has made it clear that China's scientific system is composed of four parts: the Chinese Academy of Sciences, institutions of higher education, industrial sectors, and local areas, and must be considered as a whole, with division of labor and cooperation. Proper arrangements have also been made for funding and conditions. In this way, the work of higher education has finally embarked on a regular path that has been proven correct by long-term experience. However, scientific research needs a process of arduous labor to blossom and bear fruit in institutions of higher education. I believe that teachers in institutions of higher education have the confidence and determination to catch up with the world level in two five-year plans.

III. The Relationship between Young and Old Teachers is Gradually Returning to Normal, and the Relationship between the Party and the Masses on Campus will also Improve

Young teachers have relatively pure thoughts, are full of enthusiasm, are easy to accept new things, and are easy to progress politically. Therefore, in the early stage of teaching reform, they were mainly relied on to play a pioneering role to accelerate the pace of progress. In the process of ideological transformation, it was also found that old teachers had many problems, which were deeply rooted and difficult to change, and the necessary ideological shock could not be produced without the assistance of young people. In these processes, on the one hand, the self-confidence and pride of young teachers grew, and on the other hand, the prestige of old teachers was reduced, and even their academic achievements and rich experience were underestimated. The relationship between young and old became extremely abnormal. This situation is very detrimental to the progress of higher education. In the past two or three years, corrections have begun to be made and various measures have been taken. We have repeatedly pointed out to young comrades that academic achievements are the result of many years of hard work and study, and must be constantly guided by people who know the way to avoid detours. It is definitely not enough to rely solely on one's enthusiasm and initiative. Young people are easy to progress politically because they are less influenced by the old society; they may not be able to move forward quickly academically because the conditions required here are different. In the later stage of teaching reform, schools have relied more on old teachers for the improvement of professional courses, the preparation of specialized courses, and the leadership of graduation theses; since the call to march toward science was put forward, the importance of old teachers has become even more prominent. Some of them have rich research experience, and many have research training. Young teachers must strive for their leadership and training in order to march toward science. At the same time, in order to achieve more research results in a limited time, old teachers also need assistants and collaborators. This creates opportunities to improve the relationship between them and gradually normalize it. The relationship between young and old discussed above also involves the relationship between the Party and the masses, because nine out of ten young teachers are Party or League members, while only a very small number of old teachers are Party members. Of course, this is only a part of the relationship between the Party and the masses. In addition, there is the issue of old cadres. They have rich struggle experience, but they must have certain professional knowledge to work in institutions of higher education, which requires humble learning and active research. In addition, the thinking of senior intellectuals is complex, and the situation is also complex, and learning to correctly handle their problems is not easy, requiring detailed analysis and prudent research. The Party has begun the rectification movement to examine the various possible shortcomings in past work, which provides very favorable conditions for improving the relationship between the Party and the masses. The development of democratic parties in institutions of higher education also helps to improve relations in all aspects. In short, the relationship issue in institutions of higher education is an extremely complex, delicate, and long-term issue that must be paid attention to at all times.

IV. Political and Ideological Education must be Vigorously Strengthened

Although the teachers of institutions of higher education have undergone five major movements and diligent political study, and have made considerable progress in ideological understanding, they have ultimately been influenced by the bourgeoisie for a long time. Although young students are relatively simple, their worker-peasant composition is still very small, and most of them are still from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois backgrounds. Individualism and absolute democratic thinking are still lurking in the depths of their hearts, so some of them are not happy with the collective, do not like discipline, emphasize personal interests and personal needs, and often have great resistance to acting with leadership and planning. Therefore, the unity of freedom and discipline, and the application of democracy and centralism, are still extremely important issues in the ideological work of schools. A strong individualistic thinking will inevitably produce a self-righteous, arrogant, and selfish consciousness and style, and will not be willing to admit that there are priorities, and will not be able to cooperate with others. Therefore, difficulties have arisen in terms of public medical care, welfare funds, scholarships, etc., because the advanced socialist system is incompatible with the backward bourgeois thinking. People with these serious ideological shortcomings cannot play a good role in socialist construction. Therefore, we believe that today in institutions of higher education, political and ideological education must not be relaxed, but should be greatly strengthened, and education and criticism should be conducted regularly in conjunction with specific examples. Many intellectuals subjectively agree to accept the Party's leadership and support the socialist system, but sometimes their thoughts and actions resonate with the rightists and even go to the edge of the enemy-us boundary! The reason for this, on the one hand, is that the old ideology has not been transformed well, and it is necessary to study politics regularly and get theoretical guidance, and on the other hand, it is also because of insufficient emotional connection with workers and peasants. Therefore, Chairman Mao wants our senior intellectuals to get off their horses and look at flowers, and mingle with workers and peasants. Among young people, he advocates labor education so that they can deeply understand the truth that labor creates the world and that workers and peasants create wealth for the country, and deeply understand that this creation is not easy. With this kind of perceptual knowledge, they can stand firm. Our future political and ideological education work will be improved based on these principles.

    党在高等学校的领导是绝对必要的
    杨石先说：右派妄想通过把持教育来篡夺国家的各种领导权，这种奸谋诡计是逃不过人民的眼睛的。
    这几年来，我们在教育事业上所进行的改革是起了巨大的作用的。高等院校如果不是经过院系调整和教学改革，就无法完成国家在经济建设中迫切需要大量人材的任务；中小学如果不是经过学习苏联、扩展改进，亦很难应付广大人民特别是工农子弟热烈要求受到教育的愿望。七年当中（一九四九年至一九五六年）高等院校毕业了三十多万受过专业训练的学生，在许多岗位上进行工作。在全国范围内有百分之六七十及龄儿童（平均数）能够入学。从过去非常薄弱的教育基础上来看不能不算是一项奇迹。这一奇迹和许许多多其他奇迹一样，都是在中国共产党的领导下做出来的，而右派分子硬要说党不能领导教育，甚至主张党委退出学校！他们是别有用心的。当六月初旬报纸上出现了这种荒谬言论，我们天津市三个民主党派（民盟、民进、九三）召集了四个高等院校最有声望的教授数十人来举行座谈会，研究高等学校的领导体制问题。会上大家异口同声的批判了右派的谬论，一致认为党在高等学校的领导是绝对必要的，不但不应该取消或者削弱，反而应该大大的加强，并且分别提出了如何加强的具体意见。因为教育事业关系国家将来的命运，没有党的思想领导和组织保证，社会主义的前途就很难坚持了。右派分子当中某些人是有政治野心的，他们妄想篡夺现在党的政治领导权，并且还妄想通过把持教育来篡夺将来国家的各种领导权。这种奸谋诡计是逃不过人民的眼睛的。我们全国的知识分子，特别是民主党派的成员，首先要在思想上政治上和他们划清界限，更要在群众中予以大力的驳斥使他们的荒言谬论得不到任何市场。
    肯定我们在教育工作上的成绩，并不等于说我们在教育改革中没有犯错误，亦不是说现在一切都尽善尽美不需要改进了。过去我们犯的错误是不少的，现在存在的缺点亦还是很多的。在大鸣大放中，在整风开始时群众是提出了许多批评的，而其中一大部分是正确的。各级党委亦表示接受这种正确的批评并且对有些项目已作了纠正。我们不能因为右派分子的错误行为就不鸣不放了，就不向党组织和党员们提批评了。这完全是两桩事，不应混淆在一起。
    我是在高等学校工作多年的人，仅就我在一个大学中体会到的情况向大会汇报一下，其中有不正确的地方请代表们提出批评指正。
    一、教学质量正在不断的提高
    许多人批评这几年高等学校的教学质量不高，这是事实。构成的原因甚多，比较主要的有三个：（一）大批年青没有经验的教师在讲授基础课和专业课；（二）班内学生人数甚多而程度又相去悬殊，教师精力常常用在程度甚差的学生上；（三）整套搬用苏联教学制度，要很好的了解内容和作用需要一个过程，再结合中国实际又需要一个过程。何况有若干本来不是苏联的成功经验，当然就枉费了大家的精力和时间。现在教学改革已基本完成。经过这段艰苦历程，青年教师已成长了，有了较多经验。教学计划、教学大纲已尽量修改使和中国现状相适应。因招生数字减少，高中毕业生增多，新生质量有了保障，一班之中程度不致差别过大。这些情况都有助于教学质量的改进。此外，我们又针对过去所发生的偏差加以特别注意和大力纠正。这种偏差亦是不少的并且有的是非常严重的。例如一个偏差是学生缺乏独立思考能力。过去学生程度不齐，为了使学校少出废品，遂过分强调“保教保学”，将构成废品的责任全部推到教师身上。而苏联教学计划的课程门数既多，钟点亦重，多数学生不能消化甚至无法完成，遂造成了依赖教师的思想。有的学生一大部分的工作是教师把了手作的。学生自己不能咀嚼消化，怎么能运用呢！而教师则是尽了他们的最大努力，花费了几倍的时间来辅导学生。有的学生本来多作些努力是可以独立思考的，亦趁机倒在教师怀内了。对双方所造成的损失都是很大的。最近两年来我们已注意了这一问题，向学生指出它的危害性并且现在班上的情况亦与从前不同，纠正就不至有大的困难了。
    另一个偏差是学生当中不正确的“专家”思想。我不是说学生有了专家的志愿即不正确，而是说他们对于专家的理解和如何去达成专家的作法是不够正确的。我们过去过分的批评英美的“通才教育”，强调专家思想，加上苏联的专业在过去一段时期分得过细（现在已改正）。有些学生遂错误的忽视基础课，放松了某些专业课，只注意专门化的课，当然亦是因为课业太重的缘故。结果基础不固、底子很小，所知道的东西只上面的一点点。这就造成他们毕业后在工作上的困难，很难对上口径；即使暂时对上了，将来的发展前途亦不大。这样的“专家”，对于国家、对于个人都没有好处。我们不少人的看法是学生在校的时间只四五年，最主要的还是把某一专业的底子打好，使他离校后能自己继续前进，若干太专门的东西他可以留到工作岗位上再去学习掌握。这样就大大地减少了对口径的困难。一个专家的培养成功亦不是短期在学校读一两门课即行的。
    还有一个偏差是学生的文字工具太差。用简单的文字叙述事情往往是写不清楚，写不通顺。线装书完全不会看。一国外文阅读的能力亦没有。显然和大学生的要求是不符合的。这种情况的造成，教育部和地方的教育厅（局）应当负很大的责任。如果说一部分的中学生用不着这些东西，那么应当使有志升大学的学生有选修的机会。不少的人对这种情况表示过不满的意见，而教育部直到最近才在想办法、采取一些措施，以致这几年来绝大部分高等学校毕业生只能抱了几本教科书和讲义作为知识的唯一宝库，更无其他自学途径。外文的学习，如果只靠大学的两三年训练是不够的。这种情况当然亦同样存在于青年教师当中，难怪有不少的人担心某些老的学者和科学家死了将会有一段时间无适当的接班人。我们希望中等教育和我们一起能迅速改变这一情况。
    二、教学和研究的地位已摆在正确的基础上
    过去高教部感到为国家培养建设人材的任务非常沉重艰巨，突出强调了教学的一面，这在开国初期大力进行教学改革是有必要的。等到中国科学院访苏代表团回国后已明确两者都是高等学校的正常任务，并且它们是相辅相成不应有所偏废。高教部是有人参加代表团的。同时国外来华访问的高教人士如德意志民主共和国高教部长和国务院苏联总顾问都亦一再指出开展研究的重要性。高教部迟迟未作安排，使高等院校不少老科学家感到失望，因而产生了“人心向院（科学院）”的现象。直至前年底党提出了向科学进军的口号，才开始有了转变，今春高等教育赴苏访问团归国后方才恍然须积极加以推动。现在又经国务院科学规划委员会明确了我国的科学体制是由中国科学院、高等院校、产业部门和地方四个部分组成的，必须加以统筹兼顾，分工协作。对于经费和条件亦作了妥善安排。这样高等教育工作终于走上了正规的和长期经验证明是正确的道路。不过科学研究要在高等学校开花结实尚需要一段艰苦劳动的过程。我相信高等学校的教师是有信心和决心在两个五年计划内赶上世界水平的。
    三、教师的青老关系渐趋正常，校内的党群关系亦将有所改善
    青年教师思想比较纯洁，富于热情，容易接受新的事物，在政治上容易进步。故在教学改革初期，主要依靠他们起先锋的作用来加速前进的步伐。在思想改造的过程中，又发现老年教师毛病甚多，积重难返，不由青年群众协助不能产生思想上的必要震动。在这些过程中一方面滋长了青年教师的自信和骄傲情绪，另一方面降低了老教师的威信甚至低估了他们的学术成就和丰富经验。青老之间的关系变得极不正常。这一情况对于高等教育的进展是非常不利的。前二三年已开始纠正采取种种措施。我们一再向青年同志们指出学术造诣是多年刻苦钻研的结果，并须有识路的人经常指点才能不走弯路，绝不是单纯靠自己的热诚和积极性就行了。青年在政治上容易进步，因为他们受旧社会的影响较少；在学术上就不一定能很快的前进，因为这里要求的条件不同。在教学改革的后期关于专业课的改进，专门化课的准备和毕业论文的领导，学校已更多的依靠老年教师；自向科学进军的号召提出后老教师的重要性更加突出了。他们当中有些人是有丰富研究经验的，不少的人是有研究训练的。青年教师要向科学进军必须争取他们的领导和培养。同时老教师为了要在有限的时间内取得更多的研究成果，亦需要有助手和合作者。这样就创造了机会来改善他们之间的关系，使之逐渐走向正常化。上面所谈的青老关系亦涉及党群关系，因为青年教师十有九是党团员，而老教师则只极少数为党员。当然这只是党群关系的一部分。此外还有老干部的问题，他们有丰富的斗争经验，但在高等学校工作必须有一定的业务知识，这是需要虚心学习和积极钻研才能掌握的。加以高级知识分子的思想复杂，情况亦复杂，学会正确的处理他们的问题亦不是容易的事情，需要细致的分析和审慎的研究。党已开始了整风运动，检查过去工作中各种可能存在的缺点，就对改进党群关系提供了极有利的条件。民主党派在高等学校的发展亦有助于改善各方面的关系。总之，关系问题在高等学校是一项极其复杂、细致的长期问题，须要时时刻刻加以注意的。
    四、政治思想教育工作还必须大力加强
    高等学校的教师们虽然经过了五大运动和辛勤的政治学习，在思想认识上有了不少的提高，但终究是长期受了资产阶级的影响。青年学生虽然比较单纯，然而他们的工农成分还是很少，大部分仍是资产阶级和小资产阶级出身的，个人主义和绝对民主的思想仍在他们的心灵深处潜伏着，所以他们有些人不高兴集体、不喜欢纪律、强调个人兴趣和个人需要，对有领导有计划的行事往往产生很大的抵触情绪。故自由与纪律的统一、民主和集中的运用，在学校的思想工作中还是极重要的问题。有浓厚的个人主义思想必然产生自高自大、自私自利的意识和作风，就不肯承认有轻重缓急，就不能和别人合作。所以在公费医疗、福利费、助学金等等方面，都发生了困难，因为先进的社会主义制度和落后的资产阶级思想是不相容的。具有这些严重思想缺点的人在社会主义建设当中是不能起很好的作用的。故我们认为今天在高等学校内，政治思想教育工作绝对不能放松而是应当大大的加强，结合具体事例经常进行教育批判。许多知识分子在主观愿望上是同意接受党的领导的，是拥护社会主义制度的，而在思想行动上有时会与右派共鸣甚至走到敌我界限的边缘！其原因，一方面固然由于旧思想未改造好，要经常学习政治，得到理论的指导，另一方面亦由于在情感上和工农的联系不够。所以毛主席要我们高级知识分子下马观花与工农打成一片，在青年当中则提倡劳动教育使他们深刻体会劳动创造世界和工农为国家创造财富的真理而深刻体会这种创造是不容易的。有了这种感性知识就能够站稳立场。我们今后的政治思想教育工作，是要本着这些原则去改进的。
