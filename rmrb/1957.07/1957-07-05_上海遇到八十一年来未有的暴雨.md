Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 4th. Shanghai has been experiencing continuous heavy rain since July 1st. In the past three days, the rainfall has exceeded 200 millimeters. Such sustained and concentrated heavy rain is a rare phenomenon in Shanghai. According to meteorological data, in the past eighty-one years, the average monthly rainfall in Shanghai in July has only been 174.4 millimeters.

The roads in Shanghai's urban area are generally flooded, with water depths exceeding two *chi* in low-lying areas. Most of the trolleybuses were forced to stop operating today, and some buses have also been rerouted or shortened their routes. Some factories have temporarily suspended work to drain water due to flooding in the factory buildings. The suburbs of Shanghai are now a vast expanse of water, and low-lying crops have been almost completely submerged. In areas where drainage is possible, farmers are braving the rain to drain water.

This afternoon, the Municipal Flood Control Headquarters held an emergency telephone conference to deploy flood control work for various enterprises, factories, institutions, and suburban areas. According to an analysis by the Shanghai Central Meteorological Observatory, this heavy rain is caused by the confrontation between warm, humid air from the Pacific Ocean and cold air from the north over the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and there are no signs of it abating yet.

    上海遇到八十一年来未有的暴雨
    新华社上海4日电　从7月1日起，上海暴雨不断。三天多来，降雨量超过了二百公厘。这样持续、集中的暴雨是上海罕见的现象。据气象资料记载：在过去的八十一年中，上海7月份平均整个月的降雨量也只有174.4公厘。
    上海市区的马路已普遍积水，低洼地区水深二市尺以上；绝大部分电车今天被迫停驶，有的公共汽车也改道或缩短行驶路程。有些工厂因厂房进水，曾一度停工排水。上海市郊已一片汪洋，低矮农作物几乎全被淹没，能排水的地区，农民正冒雨排水中。
    今天下午，市防汛总指挥部召开了紧急电话会议，部署各企业、工厂、机关和郊区的防汛工作。据上海中心气象台分析，这次暴雨是太平洋的暖湿空气和北方的冷空气对峙在长江下游上空所造成，现在还未见有消退的迹象。
