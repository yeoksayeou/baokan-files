Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd. The Socialist Academy held a general meeting of all students this morning to expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks made by Yu Yong, a student and Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Communications.

According to the exposure, the bourgeois rightist Yu Yong, during the rectification campaign, made a series of fallacies at the Socialist Academy's general meetings and group meetings, viciously attacking the Party, the People's Government, and the socialist system from all aspects. He compared Chairman Mao to Emperor Chongzhen, a ruler who lost his country, saying, "How could there be ministers who lost the country without a ruler who lost the country?"

Yu Yong used the most刻薄 (kè bó: sharp, bitter, unkind) words to attack the Communist Party. He said, "The Communist Party in the past relied more on force to subdue people and less on virtue to convince people, especially subordinates who are completely commandist and practice a dictatorial system." He said that Communist Party members have a kind of "degenerative" manifestation, "They do not rely on labor, but on the Party for food and official positions." He spread rumors, saying, "Today's leaders and the led are completely in a relationship of rule and control, just like the leaders and subordinates in the old society, regarding the masses as mere commoners, superiors being superior, with the power of life and death at will; opposing me is opposing the Party, and opposing the Party is opposing the revolution." He also said, "The Kuomintang was a clerk politics, and now it is a secretary politics." "The messengers, guards, and secretaries are, in some ways, worse than the Kuomintang. Except for not wanting door gifts, messengers are no different from those in the Qing Dynasty." He also said that in society, Party members and non-Party members do not marry each other, attacking female comrades who are willing to marry Party and League members, saying, "If this develops, it will not be easy for non-Party members to find wives."

Yu Yong vigorously attacked our country's organizational structure. He said that various units discuss matters based on individuals, and titles are rampant, just like in feudal society, saying, "The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom perished so quickly because of the乱封官爵 (luàn fēng guān jué: chaotic conferral of official titles)." He cursed those who work in trade unions as "工官 (gōng guān: official in trade union)", those who run schools as "学官 (xué guān: official in school)", those who run businesses as "商官 (shāng guān: official in business)", and those who do women's work as "妇官 (fù guān: official in women's work)".

Yu Yong described the flourishing new countryside as "despotic and dictatorial," without "democratic politics," "many cadres have become local emperors and new bullies," farmers have "no place to cry injustice," and "even freedom of movement is lacking." He described our country's people's democratic dictatorship as a "Party dictatorship under the leadership of the proletariat" and the election of people's representatives and CPPCC members as being "distributed in the manner of shareholder dividends." Yu Yong advocated abolishing the political departments and supervisory bureaus of various units. In his view, these institutions are the creators of sectarianism, commandism, and bureaucracy.

Yu Yong attacked some leaders of democratic parties, saying that they only sing praises and only talk about achievements without mentioning shortcomings, in order to pursue personal enjoyment, creating a bad atmosphere in society.

Zhou Jiabin, a student of the Socialist Academy and Counselor of the Ministry of Water Resources, exposed Yu Yong's ugly history of being anti-Communist and anti-people in his speech. He said that Yu Yong was a Communist Party member during the Great Revolution. When Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution and implemented the purge in 1927, he fled to Shanghai and joined the Third Party. During the Anti-Japanese War, he defected from the Third Party and went over to Chiang Kai-shek, issued a declaration, and then joined the Revival Society, becoming an important figure in the Revival Society. During the Anti-Japanese War, Yu Yong was sent to the Northwest to help Hu Zongnan carry out anti-communist work, becoming Hu Zongnan's anti-communist political adviser. Before liberation, during the tenure of Xuan Tiewu and Qian Dajun as the Shanghai pseudo-garrison commander, Yu Yong served as a senior staff officer and was also a director of the Zhongzheng School.

The students expressed great indignation at Yu Yong's absurd remarks in their speeches, believing that his remarks were "the Voice of America, the voice of Taiwan." "It is a compilation of the reactionary remarks of rightists." Everyone demanded that Yu Yong take out all his unspeakable things, thoroughly criticize them, and bow his head to the people and confess his guilt.

    俞墉恶意毁谤我们国家的一切
    社会主义学院开始对他进行批判
    新华社23日讯　社会主义学院今天上午举行全体学员大会，揭露和批判学员、交通部专门委员俞墉的反党反社会主义言论。
    据揭露，资产阶级右派分子俞墉在整风期间，在社会主义学院的大会上和小组会上发表了一系列的谬论，从各方面恶毒地攻击党、人民政府和社会主义制度。他把毛主席比喻成与崇祯皇帝一样的亡国之君，说“不是亡国之君那里来的亡国之臣？”
    俞墉用了最刻薄的词句攻击共产党。他说，“共产党过去以力服人做得多，以德服人做得少，尤其是下属完全是命令主义，独裁制度”。说什么共产党员有一种“堕性”的表现，“他们不是靠劳动，而是靠党吃饭，靠党做官”。他造谣说，“今天领导者与被领导者，完全是统治的关系、控制的关系，如同旧社会的领导者与部下，把群众看成小百姓，上司高人一等，生杀欲夺，遂心所欲，反我就是反党，反党就是反革命”。他又说，“国民党是科员政治，现在是秘书政治。”“传达、警卫、秘书人员在某一点上，比国民党更坏，传达除了不要门包外，和清朝没有什么不同。”他还说，在社会上，党群不通婚，攻击女同志都愿意找党团员结婚，说“发展下去非党员讨老婆也不容易了”。
    俞墉大肆攻击我们国家的组织机构，他说，各单位因人议事，名义泛滥，和封建社会一样，说什么“太平天国灭亡之快，就是因为乱封官爵”。他骂作工会工作的人是“工官”，办学校的人是“学官”，办商业的人是“商官”，做妇女工作的是“妇官”。
    俞墉把欣欣向荣的新农村，说成是“专制独裁”，没有“民主政治”，“许多干部成了土皇帝、新恶霸”，农民“喊冤无处”，“连行动自由都没有”。他把我国的人民民主专政制度说成是“无产阶级领导下的党员专政”，把人民代表和政协委员的产生说成是“用股东分红的方式来分配”。俞墉主张取消各单位的政治部、监察局等，在他看来，这些机构是制造宗派主义、命令主义和官僚主义的。
    俞墉攻击有些民主党派的负责人，他们光歌功颂德，只讲成绩不讲缺点，是为了追求个人享乐，造成了社会上的不良空气。
    社会主义学院学员、水利部参事周嘉彬在发言中揭露了俞墉反共反人民的丑恶历史。他说，俞墉在大革命时代是一个共产党员，1927年蒋介石背叛革命实行清党的时候，他逃到上海加入了第三党。抗日战争期间，又叛变了第三党投向蒋介石，并发了宣言，而后参加了复兴社，成为复兴社的重要角色。抗日战争期间，俞墉被派到西北帮助胡宗南搞反共的工作，成了胡宗南反共的政治参谋。解放前，在宣铁吾和钱大钧任上海伪警备司令期间，俞墉任高级参谋，又是中正学校的校董。
    学员们在发言中对俞墉的荒谬言论一致表示极大的愤慨，认为他的言论是“美国之音，台湾之声。”
  “是集右派分子反动言论之大成。”大家要求俞墉把自己那些见不得人的东西统统拿出来，彻底进行批判，向人民低头认罪。
