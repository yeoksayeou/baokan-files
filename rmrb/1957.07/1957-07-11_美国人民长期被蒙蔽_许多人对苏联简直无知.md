    American People Have Long Been Deceived
    Many Are Simply Ignorant of the Soviet Union

    (Reported by this newspaper) The extent to which the American monopoly capital's propaganda machine has deceived ordinary American people can be seen from a survey on the Soviet Union conducted by the American "McCall's Magazine." According to an article titled "What Americans Don't Know About the Soviet Union" published in the June issue of the magazine, the participants in the survey included 500 men and 500 women from various regions, of different ages and educational levels. The following astonishing results were found in all the answers:

    Two-thirds of the women, when asked if they would like to visit the Soviet Union, refused a free trip to the Soviet Union. A woman from Georgia said: "It's too dangerous, they will kill Americans."

    In the Midwest and the South, most people believe that there are absolutely no churches left in the Soviet Union. A woman from Alabama said: "As far as we know, the churches have all been destroyed."

    The majority of people believe that there is no free love in the Soviet Union. One person in the Midwest even replied: "Do they still believe in love?"

    Only 54% of people knew that the Soviet Union fought alongside the United States in World War II. 10% of people thought that the United States and Germany fought together against the Soviet Union at that time.

    29% of people did not know that Moscow is the capital of the Soviet Union. Two-fifths of college graduates answered this question incorrectly.

    More than half of the people simply did not know who the head of the Soviet government was.

    The American bourgeois propaganda machine spreads a large amount of distorted news to the American people every day through tens of millions of newspapers and radio stations, causing ordinary American people to be suspicious and fearful of the Soviet Union, and to be very ignorant of the truth.

    美国人民长期被蒙蔽
    许多人对苏联简直无知
    本报讯　美国垄断资本的宣传机器已经把普通美国人民蒙蔽到什么程度，这一点从美国“麦考尔杂志”所进行的一次关于苏联情况的测验中可以得到说明。据该杂志6月号刊载的一篇题为“美国人不知道苏联什么”的文章报道，参加测验的人包括各地区、不同年龄和文化程度的五百名男子和五百名妇女。在全部答案中，有下列令人吃惊的结果：
    三分之二的妇女在回答是否愿访问苏联的问题时，拒绝免费去苏联旅行，佐治亚州一个妇女说：“这太危险，他们会打死美国人的。”
    在中西部和南部，大多数人都认为苏联完全没有教会了。阿拉巴姆的一个妇女说：“据我们所知，教会已经全被消灭了。”
    多半数人相信苏联没有自由恋爱，中西部有一个人甚至这样回答：“他们还相信爱情吗？”
    只有54％的人知道在第二次世界大战中苏联是同美国并肩作战的。有10％的人认为当时是美德联合同苏联作战的。
    29％的人不知道莫斯科是苏联的首都。高等学校毕业生中有五分之二答错了这个问题。
    有一多半的人干脆不知道苏联政府首脑是谁。
    美国资产阶级宣传机器每天通过几千万份报纸和广播台对美国人民散布大量歪曲了的消息，使得美国普通人民对苏联发生猜疑和恐惧，而对真相十分无知。
