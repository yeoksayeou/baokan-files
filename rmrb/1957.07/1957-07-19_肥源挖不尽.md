    Inexhaustible Sources of Fertilizer

    Returning Rice Straw to the Field as Fertilizer
    Returning the fresh rice straw left after harvesting early rice directly to the field as fertilizer for late rice is a good way to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage for late rice. According to tests, the rice straw left from one mu of land producing 450 jin of grain is about 750 jin, containing 4.5 jin of nitrogen, 11 liang of phosphorus, and 6 jin of potassium. The Xiangxiang County Farm has proven through years of experiments that applying 50%-60% of the rice straw left after harvesting early rice on one mu of late rice field is equivalent to 70-80 dan of "Da Dang" manure. Returning rice straw to the field can also improve the soil, increase the granular structure of the soil, loosen hardened soil, and increase the soil temperature of cold soaking fields.

    Intercropping Green Manure in Late Rice Fields
    Intercropping red clover in double-cropping late rice fields is the most economical and effective way to increase natural fertilizer in large quantities and continuously improve soil fertility. Red clover is a relatively moisture-tolerant green manure crop, suitable for planting in rice fields. Intercropping red clover can not only provide sufficient fertilizer for the field but also expand the fertilization area by two to five times or more. Red clover is a leguminous plant that can fix nitrogen from the air and turn it into nitrogen fertilizer through the action of rhizobia. The Qinghe Production Team of the Yitai Agricultural Cooperative in Wuhu County intercropped red clover in 3.4 mu of double-cropping late rice fields, with an average yield of 5,928 jin of fresh grass per mu. In addition to meeting the sufficient fertilizer needs of the field, it also increased the fertilization area by two times. The 3.4 mu of land planted with red clover yielded 600 jin of early rice per mu, which was 140 jin to 200 jin more than the adjacent fields without red clover.

    Large Quantity of Human Excrement and Urine
    One thousand jin of human feces contains about 10 jin of nitrogen, and one thousand jin of human urine contains about 5 jin of nitrogen. In terms of nitrogen content, human feces contain twice as much nitrogen as human urine. Generally, an adult excretes about 180 jin of feces and about 1,400 jin of urine per year. The nitrogen in feces is about 1 jin and 13 liang, which is equivalent to the amount of nitrogen in 25 jin of soybean cake; the nitrogen in urine is about 7 jin, which is equivalent to all the nitrogen in 100 jin of soybean cake. If half of the urine excreted by an adult in a year can be utilized, it is equivalent to the effect of more than 50 jin of soybean cake.
    If an agricultural production cooperative with 1,000 households has 5,000 people, calculated as 3,000 adults, if half of the urine of 3,000 people can be collected and utilized, it would be equivalent to increasing nitrogen fertilizer by more than 150,000 jin of soybean cake per year, which can increase grain production by about 200,000 jin; if it is used to increase vegetable production, the effect will be even better.

    Livestock Manure is an Important Source of Fertilizer
    Under normal circumstances, how much fertilizer can various livestock accumulate in a year? Each horse can accumulate 30,000 jin (calculated with half soil mixed in, same below); each cow can accumulate 40,000 jin; each pig can accumulate 16,000 jin; each sheep can accumulate 2,000 jin; every 20 chickens can accumulate 600 jin; each kang (heated brick bed) can yield 500 jin of kang cave soil; each household can accumulate an average of 2,000 jin of plant ash.

    Cities Have Plenty of Miscellaneous Fertilizer
    According to a survey by the Production Materials Management Department of the Wuhan Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in addition to producing 4 million dan of human excrement and urine annually, Wuhan City can also produce more than 600,000 dan of local and miscellaneous fertilizers such as pig manure, cow manure, chicken manure, oil residue, sauce residue, sugar residue, pig hair fluff, chicken and duck feathers, etc., and 4 million dan of rice husk ash, pig and cattle skin scraps, tangerine peel residue, human hair, garbage, ditch mud, etc. annually. These fertilizers combined are more than enough to meet the needs of suburban agricultural production. (Yangtze Daily)

    Peat Reserves Are Very Rich
    According to preliminary surveys by industrial and mineral exploration departments, the peat reserves in Yuyao, Yinxian, Pingyang, and Hangzhou West Lake alone are estimated to be 6.7 million tons.
    According to the results of tests by the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the organic matter content in the peat found in this province is generally above 50%, and the nitrogen content is about 1.5% to 2%, and it also contains a small amount of phosphorus and potassium. If calculated only by nitrogen, every 100 jin of peat is equivalent to 8 to 9 jin of ammonium sulfate.  (Zhejiang Daily)

    肥源挖不尽
    稻草还田是肥料
    把早稻收割后留下的新鲜稻草，就地还田作晚稻肥料，是解决晚稻缺肥的一个好办法。据化验，一亩产谷四百五十斤的田留下的稻草约为七百五十斤，其中含氮四斤半、磷十一两、钾六斤。湘乡县农场经过历年试验证明，一亩晚稻田施用本田早稻收割后留下稻草的50％—60％，能抵七十一八十担大凼粪。稻草还田，还能够改良土壤，增加土壤中的团粒结构，使板结的泥土变得松软，使冷浸田增加泥温。

    晚稻田里套种绿肥
    在双季晚稻田里套种红花草，是大量增加自然肥料、不断提高土壤肥力的最经济和最有效的办法。红花草是较耐湿的绿肥作物，适合在稻田里种植。套种红花草不仅能使本田得到足够的肥料，而且还可扩大二至五倍以上的施肥面积。红花草是豆科植物，借根瘤菌的作用，可以固定空气里的氮气，变成氮肥。芜湖县易太农业社庆和生产队在三亩四分双季晚稻田里套种的红花草，每亩平均收鲜草五千九百二十八斤，除了满足本田足够的肥料以外，还增加了二倍施肥面积。这三亩四分种红花草的田，早稻每亩收六百斤，比连边没有种红花草的田每亩多收一百四十斤至二百斤。

    人粪尿的数量很大
    一千斤人粪里含氮素十斤左右，一千斤人尿里含氮素五斤左右，从含氮量来说，人粪比人尿多一倍。一般成年人每年排泄粪的数量约为一百八十斤左右，尿约一千四百斤左右，粪里面的氮素约为一斤十三两，相当二十五斤豆饼里面的氮素数量；尿里的氮素约为七斤左右，相当一百斤豆饼中所有的氮素。一个成年人一年排泄的尿，若能利用一半的话，就等于五十多斤豆饼的效果。
    假如一个有一千户的农业生产合作社中有五千人，按三千成年人计算，如果能够把三千人的尿收集一半来利用的话，一年就等于增加十五万多斤豆饼的氮肥，就可以增产粮食二十万斤左右；若是用来增产蔬菜，那效果就更好了。
                          （北京日报）
    牲畜粪是一项重要的肥源
    在一般的情况下，一年内各种牲畜可以积攒多少肥料？每匹马可积三万斤
  （按混土一半计算，以下同）；每头牛可积四万斤；每口猪可积一万六千斤；每只羊可积二千斤；每二十只鸡可积六百斤；每铺炕可折五百斤炕洞土；每户平均能攒二千斤草木灰。
                      （黑龙江日报）
    城市的杂肥多得很
    据武汉市供销合作社生产资料经理部的调查，武汉市每年除了能生产人粪尿四百万担以外，猪粪、牛粪、鸡粪、油渣、酱渣、糖渣、猪毛绒子、鸡鸭毛等土杂肥料每年可出六十余万担，糠壳烧灰、猪牛皮屑、桔子皮渣、人发、垃圾、沟泥等等，每年也可出四百万担。这些肥料加起来，供应郊区农业生产的需要是足足有余的。（长江日报）
    泥炭蕴藏非常丰富
    根据工业矿产勘查部门的初步调查估计，仅在余姚、鄞县、平阳和杭市西湖等地就蕴藏着泥炭六百七十万吨。
    据省农业科学研究所化验的结果，本省所发现的泥炭中的有机质含量一般都在50％以上，氮素含量1.5％到2％左右，还含有少量的磷素和钾素。如光以氮素来计算，每百斤泥炭就相当于硫酸铵八斤到九斤。  （浙江日报）
