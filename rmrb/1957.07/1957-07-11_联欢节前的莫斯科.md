    Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper: The Sixth World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship will open soon, and Moscow is working hard to prepare for the conference.
    The festival will open on July 28th, and a grand opening ceremony will be held at the newly built Lenin Central Stadium in Moscow. Representatives of different races from all continents will gather here. Nearly 30,000 representatives from 147 countries will participate. To successfully hold such a large-scale festival requires a lot of preparation: arranging the conference schedule, decorating the venue and the city. During the festival, the entire Moscow will become a large garden, with every street and square becoming a place for young people from all over the world to communicate and celebrate. In addition, various competitions, visits, and exhibitions need to be organized, accommodation for the representatives must be prepared, and translators for various languages ​​must be arranged... All these complex tasks are the responsibility of the Festival Preparatory Committee.
    The Preparatory Committee receives many letters and telegrams every day. For example, on June 20th, the Preparatory Committee received registration forms from France, Belgium, and other countries to participate in the meeting of philatelic enthusiasts. In addition, seven countries registered to participate in the gathering of radio enthusiasts, and twelve countries registered to participate in the meeting of film enthusiasts. The programs of the festival are diverse, and the symposiums by young people of the same profession will be a new form.
    Soviet artists are racking their brains to beautify the streets and squares of Moscow. The trees on both sides of many streets will be covered with wooden bottle-shaped covers, and tall green trees will become flowers inserted in large vases. Girls and young men in various national costumes will dance folk dances or brisk waltzes in the squares. In the square in front of the Kursk Railway Station, a large "flying carpet" will be erected in the sky, just like in Russian fairy tales, with young people of all nationalities embracing on the carpet.
    Now, as you walk on the streets of Moscow, you can see posters for the festival everywhere. Some use the national flags of various countries to form a beautiful wreath, and some twist them into the Arabic numeral "6", representing the Sixth World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship. According to the Soviet "Spark" magazine, more than two million copies of such posters have now been printed.
    In order to select representatives to participate in the festival, the Communist Youth League organizations in various parts of the Soviet Union organized local youth festivals, selecting outstanding performers to participate in the Moscow Festival competition. The Leningrad University Choir has won the right to participate in the festival, and the delegation from Sverdlovsk will perform the "Ural Gem Dance."
    The delegations from afar have already set off, and in half a month they will set foot on Soviet soil—Moscow is ready to welcome guests. (Attached picture)

    联欢节前的莫斯科
    本报莫斯科航讯：第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节很快就要开幕了，莫斯科正在紧张地进行大会的准备工作。
    这次联欢节将在7月28日开幕，在去年新建成的莫斯科列宁中央运动场要举行隆重的开幕式，来自各洲的不同种族的代表在这里将齐集一堂。将有一百四十七个国家的将近三万名代表参加。要开好这样规模巨大的联欢节是要做好很多准备工作的：要排好大会日程，要布置会场，装饰城市，在联欢节的时候，整个莫斯科将变成一个大花园，任何一个街道、广场全将变成各国青年交谈联欢的所在。另外要组织各种比赛、参观和展览，要为代表准备住处，要准备各种语言的翻译……这许多复杂的工作全由联欢节筹备委员会负责。
    筹备委员会每天都接到许多信件和电报，例如6月20日这一天筹备委员会就接到法国、比利时等国报名参加集邮爱好者会见的报名书，另外有七个国家报名参加无线电爱好者的集会，十二个国家报名参加电影爱好者的会见。联欢的节目是各种各样的，由同样职业青年的座谈会，将是一个新的形式。
    苏联的艺术家们正在为美化莫斯科街道、广场方面，费尽心思。许多街道两旁的树木将穿上木制的瓶状外罩，而高大的绿树将变成插在大花瓶里的一支花。穿着各种民族服装的姑娘和小伙子将在广场上跳着集体舞或轻快的华尔兹。而在库尔斯克火车站前的广场上空，将像俄罗斯童话里说的一样，架起一个大型的“飞毯”，毯上立着拥抱在一起的各民族青年。
    现在当你走在莫斯科街上，你到处都可以看见联欢节的招贴画有的用各国国旗组成一个美丽的花环，有的把它盘成个阿拉伯数字“6”，表示第六届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节，据苏联“火星”杂志报道，这样的招贴画现在印成了二百多万份。
    为了选派参加联欢节的代表，苏联各地共青团组织组织了地方性的青年联欢节，选拔了优秀的表演者参加莫斯科联欢节比赛。列宁格勒大学的合唱团已经取得了参加联欢节的权利，斯维尔德洛夫斯克的代表团将表演“乌拉尔宝石舞”。
    远方的代表团已经启程了，再过半个月他们将踏上苏联国土——莫斯科已经准备好迎接客人。（附图片）
