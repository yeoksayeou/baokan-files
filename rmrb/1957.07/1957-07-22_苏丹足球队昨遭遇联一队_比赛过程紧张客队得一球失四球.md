    Sudan Football Team Encounters Joint Team One Yesterday
    Tense Match Sees Visiting Team Score One Goal, Concede Four

    (Our Dispatch) The Sudan football team played a tense friendly match against China's Joint Team One for eighty minutes yesterday afternoon at the Xiannongtan Stadium. Joint Team One won with a score of four to one.

    After the match, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long went onto the field to shake hands with the players of both teams one by one and took photos together.

    At the start of the match, the visiting team was aggressive, with the defenders and midfielders rushing forward to assist the attack. They made five fierce shots within six minutes. Fortunately, Zhang Junxiu was agile and saved several dangerous shots that were almost certain to score. After the visiting team missed these scoring opportunities, their offensive momentum gradually weakened. In the fourteenth minute, Fang Renqiu, the left inside forward of the home team, received a pass from the midfielders and shot fiercely into the net from fifteen yards, opening the scoring. In the twenty-second minute, the home team's forward Qi Jin created chaos in front of the visiting team's goal. Nian Weisi seized the opportunity to shoot, and the goalkeeper Fasil fumbled the catch, allowing Wang Lu to catch up and push the ball into the net.

    In the second half, the home team replaced wingers Wang Lu and Ha Zengguang with Cong Zheyu and Xing Guifu; the visiting team's goalkeeper Fasil was replaced by Dudu. After the match resumed, both sides had their share of attacks, but none were successful. In the thirteenth minute, the visiting team used three beautiful aerial passes to push the ball into the home team's penalty area. Center forward Sheri volleyed the ball, and it flew into the net from the left corner. Less than two minutes later, the visiting team's goal was in danger. Dudu mistakenly threw the ball to Fang Renqiu, who shot fiercely. Dudu could not retreat in time and watched the ball enter the net. In the twenty-fifth minute, Nian Weisi scored another goal from eighteen yards, making it four to one. This score was maintained until the end of the match. (Attached photo)

    苏丹足球队昨遭遇联一队
    比赛过程紧张客队得一球失四球
    本报讯　苏丹足球队昨日下午在先农坛体育场和我国联队一队进行了历时八十分钟紧张的友谊比赛。联一队以四比一获胜。
    比赛完毕，周总理、贺龙副总理到场上同双方队员一一握手，并在一起摄影。
    比赛一开始，客队咄咄逼人，后卫前卫一齐冲出助攻，在六分钟内作了五次凶猛的射门，幸赖张俊秀身手矫捷，扑出了好几个势在必进的险球。客队失却这些破门机会后，攻势渐衰。到十四分钟时，主队左内锋方纫秋在获得前卫供应的球后，在十五码处猛射进网，首开记录。到二十二分钟时，主队前锋齐进，客队门前陷于混乱。年维泗乘隙射门，守门员法西尔接球漏手，被王陆赶上拨入网内。
    下半时，主队以丛者余、邢桂福替换两翼王陆、哈增光；客队门将由都都接替法西尔。比赛开始后，双方互有进攻，但都无建树。至十三分钟时，客队以三下漂亮的空中传球，将球压到主队禁区，中锋舍利凌空一脚，皮球从左角飞入网内。不到二分钟，客队大门告警，都都误将球儿掷给方纫秋，方举脚猛射，都都退守不及，眼送球儿入网。到二十五分钟时，年维泗在十八码处又射进一球，成四比一。这个记录保持至终场。（附图片）
