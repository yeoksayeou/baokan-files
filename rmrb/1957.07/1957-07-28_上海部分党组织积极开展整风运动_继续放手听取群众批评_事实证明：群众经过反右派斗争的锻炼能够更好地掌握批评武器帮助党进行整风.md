This is a dispatch from our Shanghai bureau: While carrying out the anti-Rightist struggle, the Communist Party organizations in many Shanghai municipal organs and groups have continued to openly listen to the criticisms and opinions of the masses, helping the Party to carry out the rectification movement. After the launch of the anti-Rightist struggle, some people said with ulterior motives: "If this continues, the masses will not dare to speak again in the future." The recent facts of many Shanghai organs mobilizing the masses to continue offering opinions to the Party prove that this is absolutely not the case. The reporter saw blackboards filled with various big-character posters in many organs, on both sides of the corridors, with all kinds of frank criticisms of the work and Party leaders written on them. On the blackboard of the CPC Hongkou District Committee, the reporter saw many critical articles from the masses. Someone criticized the Organization Department for upgrading too many cadres during cadre evaluation and salary assessment. About 90% of the cadres in the organs were upgraded, while the cadres of the Organization Department achieved a "full house," with 100% promotion. Someone criticized the unfairness of caring for cadres. A cadre in the Propaganda Department had 800 yuan in savings in the bank and was still subsidized 10 yuan per month. Comrades from the Zhabei District Rectification Office told the reporter: On the first day of mobilizing the masses to offer opinions in the District Public Security Bureau, the masses put forward more than 300 opinions. Because the masses were tempered by the anti-Rightist struggle and studied the documents, everyone could better master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and distinguish fragrant flowers from poisonous weeds. Nearly a thousand staff members in sixty-one units in Putuo District offered 2,955 opinions to the leaders. According to preliminary analysis, 2,642 opinions were well-intentioned and basically correct, and only a small number of opinions had personal biases or were inconsistent with the facts. There were also very few Rightist fallacies that were anti-socialist. However, these fallacies had very little market. Some organs have already solved some specific problems that are easier to solve, according to the spirit of "rectifying while correcting." The People's Bank of Zhabei District has increased the number of employees receiving hardship subsidies as needed and resolved the problem of excessively long working hours for civil servants. Wu Yulin, Director of the Zhabei District Taxation Bureau, and three other Communist Party members voluntarily vacated some of their own houses for the allocation team to distribute. Fifteen households of employees in the bureau have already solved their housing difficulties.

    上海部分党组织积极开展整风运动
    继续放手听取群众批评
    事实证明：群众经过反右派斗争的锻炼能够更好地掌握批评武器帮助党进行整风
    本报上海电　上海市在开展反右派斗争的同时，许多机关、团体的共产党组织，继续放手地听取群众的批评和意见，帮助党开展整风运动。反右派斗争开展以后，有人别有用心地说：“这样一来，以后群众再也不敢说话了。”最近上海很多机关发动群众继续向党提意见的事实证明，完全不是这样。记者在很多机关的黑板报上，两边走廊上，看到贴满了各式各样的大字报，上面写着各种对工作，对党的领导人的直率批评。在中共虹口区委会的黑板报上，记者看到许多来自群众的批评稿件，有人批评组织部在掌握干部评级评薪时，升级的面太宽，机关中有90％左右都升了级，而组织部的干部则来了个“满堂红”，百分之百地提了级。有人批评照顾干部不公平，宣传部一个干部在银行里有八百元存款，还每月补助他十元。闸北区整风办公室的同志告诉记者：区公安分局在动员群众提意见的第一天内，群众就提出了三百多条意见，由于群众受到了反右派斗争的锻炼，学习了文件，大家更能正确地掌握批评与自我批评的武器，识别香花与毒草。普陀区六十一个单位的近千工作人员，对领导上提了二千九百五十五条意见，根据初步分析，有二千六百四十二条意见是善意的，基本正确的，只有小部分意见带有个人的偏激情绪，或与事实不符。还有很少数则是反社会主义的右派谬论。但这些谬论很少有市场。有的机关已经根据“边整边改”的精神，在解决若干较易解决的具体问题。闸北区的人民银行已按需要增加了职工困难补助的人数，解决了公务员劳动时间过长问题。闸北区税务局长吴玉林等四个共产党员主动地腾出一些自己住的房屋给调配小组分配。局里已有十五户职工解决了房屋的困难。
