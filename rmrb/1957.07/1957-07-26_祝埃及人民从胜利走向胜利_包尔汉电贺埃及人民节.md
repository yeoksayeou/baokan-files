    Wishing the Egyptian People Continuous Victories
    Burhan Sends Telegram to Congratulate Egyptian People's Day
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) Burhan, President of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association, sent a telegram to Egyptian President Nasser on July 26 to congratulate Egypt's "People's Day." The telegram reads as follows:
    To His Excellency President Nasser:
    As Your Excellency and the people of your country are joyously celebrating "People's Day," I extend warm, brotherly congratulations to Your Excellency and the Egyptian people on behalf of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association.
    Five years ago today, the Egyptian people overthrew the Farouk dynasty that was oppressing them. On the same day last year, they recovered sovereignty over the Suez Canal, a victory that was warmly celebrated by people all over the world. However, the evil imperialists were unwilling to accept their defeat and launched a war of aggression against Egypt, attempting to stage a comeback and seize the Suez Canal. Under Your Excellency's leadership, the Egyptian people bravely defended their motherland and, after the war, defended the integrity of the Suez Canal's sovereignty with the same resolute and courageous spirit, defeating a series of imperialist conspiracies and setting a brilliant example of anti-colonialism and the struggle for sovereign independence. I wish the Egyptian people continuous victories; may the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people be forever glorious.
  　President of the Sino-Egyptian Friendship Association Burhan, July 26

    祝埃及人民从胜利走向胜利
    包尔汉电贺埃及人民节
    本报讯　中埃友好协会会长包尔汉7月26日致电埃及共和国总统纳赛尔，祝贺埃及“人民节”。电文如下：纳赛尔总统阁下：
    当阁下和贵国人民欢欣鼓舞庆祝“人民节”的时候，我代表中埃友协向阁下和埃及人民致以热烈的、兄弟般的祝贺。
    五年前的今天，埃及人民推翻了压在自己头上的法鲁克王朝。去年同一天，收复了苏伊士运河的主权，这是全世界人民热烈庆祝的胜利，但是，万恶的帝国主义者不甘心自己的失败，发动了侵埃战争，企图卷土重来夺取苏伊士运河。埃及人民曾在阁下的领导下奋起保卫了自己的祖国，在战后又以同样坚决勇敢的精神，捍卫了苏伊士运河主权的完整，击败了帝国主义的一系列阴谋，竖起了反殖民主义争取主权独立的光辉典范。祝埃及人民从胜利走向胜利；祝中埃两国人民兄弟般的友谊永恒光辉。
  　中埃友好协会会长包尔汉　7月26日
