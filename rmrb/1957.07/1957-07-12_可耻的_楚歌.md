Shameful "Song of Chu"
　　Gǔ Sīfàn
　　Dai Jiaxiang, a history professor at East China Normal University, wrote an anti-Soviet and anti-communist "Letter to All Students," using the pseudonym "Song of Chu," which was published on a student-run blackboard newspaper. Why use this pseudonym? The meaning is very clear: he has great ambition and wants to trap the Communist Party in a "Song of Chu on all sides."
　　Let's listen to what this "Song of Chu" is singing: "The Three Great -isms are brothers born of the same mother, and this mother is the Communist Party's autocratic centralism... In addition, there is a 'Great -ism' that is even more painfully harmful, which has caused our Chinese nation to lose its independence, lose its self-esteem, and abandon the long-standing cultural traditions of the motherland for five thousand years. This Great -ism is dogmatism..." In his view, "dogmatism" undoubtedly refers to Marxism-Leninism. In his view, Marxism-Leninism and its adherents are guilty of heinous crimes, and he wishes he could emulate Emperor Gaozu of Han in those years, leading a large army to surround them at Gaixia, and annihilate them in one fell swoop amidst the sounds of the Song of Chu on all sides.
　　Not long ago, a fierce struggle against the right-wingers unfolded, and Dai Jiaxiang himself became Xiang Yu, trapped in the "Song of Chu on all sides." Xiang Yu was worthy of being a hero in his final moments. When we read the "Biography of Xiang Yu" up to "My strength uprooted mountains, my spirit overshadowed the world, but the time is unfavorable, and my steed will not go forth...", we cannot help but sigh in admiration. However, that professor still wanted to quibble. To escape the misfortune of "suicide at Wujiang," he asked the history department clerk who had "single-line contact" with him to impersonate him, and threatened, "It's okay if you admit it. If you say I wrote it, what proof do you have?" Unexpectedly, under the denunciation of five thousand teachers, students, and staff at East China Normal University, the clerk finally could not "substitute" any longer and confessed the truth. Thus, countless angry eyes in the hall focused on the dejected "King of Chu." His face was sallow, his eyes like dead fish. The carpenter made his own cangue to wear. If he does not awaken, there is only one way to die.

    可耻的“楚歌”
  　谷斯范
    华东师范大学有个历史系教授戴家祥，写了篇反苏反共的
  “告全体同学书”，化名“楚歌”，登在学生办的黑板报上。为什么化这个名？意思很明显，他有壮志雄心，要陷共产党于“四面楚歌”之中。
    且听唱的什么“楚歌”吧：“三大主义是一母所生的难兄难弟，这个母体是共产党人的专制集权……此外还有‘一大主义’为害更为凄痛，他使我们中华民族丧失独立性，失去自尊心，遗弃了祖国五千年来悠久文化传统，这一大主义即教条主义也。……”“教条主义”无疑是指马列主义，在他看来，马列主义和它的信奉者罪恶滔天，恨不得效当年之汉高祖，率重兵围之于垓下，在四面楚歌声中一鼓而歼之。
    曾几何时，反右派分子的激烈斗争展开了，戴家祥自己倒做了楚霸王，陷身于“四面楚歌”。项羽不愧为末路英雄，我们读“项羽本纪”至“力拔山兮气盖世，时不利兮骓不逝……”，不免击节三叹。可是那位教授还想狡赖，为逃避“自刎乌江”的恶运，就叫跟他“单线联系”的历史系资料员冒名顶替，并威胁说：“你承认好了，没有关系。如果说是我写的，你有什么凭据？”不料资料员在华东师大五千师生员工的声讨下，也终于“顶替”不住，如实招供了。于是，会场上无数忿怒的眼光集中在灰溜溜的“楚霸王”身上，他的脸色枯黄，眼如死鱼，木匠做枷自己戴，再不觉醒，只有死路一条了。
