Editorial: Properly Arrange for the Assignment of Primary and Secondary School Graduates to the Countryside

    The summer vacation is about to begin. After the summer vacation, a large number of primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their studies need to be arranged for. How should we arrange this? There are two basic methods: First, mobilize and persuade students whose homes are in the countryside to return home to participate in agricultural production. For students whose homes are in the cities, if they cannot study independently at home and cannot be arranged for in the cities, we should also persuade and arrange for them to engage in agricultural labor in the countryside as much as possible. Second, rely on the masses and social organizations to adopt various forms, under the principle of voluntariness, to absorb students who cannot continue their studies to continue learning, waiting for employment or further education.
    Mobilizing primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to participate in agricultural production, or organizing them to study independently, waiting for employment and further education, is the fundamental policy that the country will adopt for a considerable period of time in the future. This is because the purpose of general education in New China is mainly to cultivate physically strong manual laborers with socialist consciousness and culture; the secondary purpose is to lay the foundation of general knowledge for cultivating specialized talents. It is a matter of course and a normal phenomenon for primary and secondary school students to engage in productive labor after graduating and not being able to continue their studies. In a certain period, our industrial and mining enterprises will not increase the number of workers by much. Due to the excessive increase in the number of employees last year, industrial and mining enterprises and other units still have a surplus of employees. Although some service industries and handicrafts in cities can absorb a portion of people, the number is very limited. Therefore, for primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their studies, participating in agricultural production is a major way out.
    It is a glorious thing for primary and secondary school graduates to participate in agricultural production. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Our country is a large agricultural country, with the agricultural population accounting for more than 80 percent of the country's population. The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture, so that industry will have raw materials and markets, and it will be possible to accumulate more funds for establishing a strong heavy industry." After the realization of cooperation, agriculture will increasingly need a culturally literate labor force. Therefore, mobilizing primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their studies to participate in agricultural production is a matter of great significance to the country's socialist construction. If educated youths have a sufficient understanding of this aspect, they will surely enthusiastically go to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.
    Educated youths should realize that only by resolving to participate in industrial and agricultural production and integrating with the worker and peasant masses can they stand firmly on the position of the working people and truly become a new type of intellectual. In this anti-rightist struggle, we have seen that many old intellectuals, because they had not participated in physical labor in the past and looked down on the working people, failed the test of the socialist revolution and struggle, and some of them became anti-socialist rightists. Today's educated youths should learn a lesson from this historical fact, work hard to participate in productive labor, first of all physical labor, and go to the worker and peasant masses to temper themselves, so that they can become strong builders of socialism and loyal socialist fighters.
    Mobilizing primary and secondary school graduates to participate in agricultural production is a meticulous ideological education work, and the method of persuasion must be adopted to help students solve specific ideological problems. At present, many graduating students may be able to accept the idea of going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production if they cannot continue their studies. However, because they have lived in the cities for a long time and do not understand the situation in the countryside, they still have many questions about going to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. For example, is the countryside really hard, what will they do when they go to the countryside, how much remuneration can they get for participating in agricultural production every day, can they support their families, are there learning and cultural entertainment activities in the countryside, and so on. Therefore, in addition to making clear the necessary principles, schools and parents should also conduct serious publicity and explanation work on the specific issues raised by graduates who cannot continue their studies and are preparing to participate in agricultural production. Students should be told that there are difficulties in going to the countryside to produce, the living conditions in the countryside are worse than those in the cities, and the first thing to do when going to the countryside is to learn to be a farmer, and they should have the determination to endure hardship and overcome difficulties. After going to the countryside, they should have good relations with the farmers and should not take advantage of the farmers. Schools can also organize students to visit agricultural cooperatives to help them understand the real life of farmers and the situation in the countryside. In this regard, Wuhan's approach to organizing primary and secondary school graduates to participate in agricultural production is very good. In mid-May this year, Wuhan organized nearly 900 self-study youths into three batches to visit agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs, eat and live with the farmers, and work with the farmers for six to eight hours a day. Through these activities, the students' and parents' original incorrect views on the countryside were changed, and many people volunteered to settle down in the countryside. In this way, the students truly volunteered and the parents agreed.
    When cities organize graduates to go to the countryside for production, it is also necessary to do a good job of investigation and research, carefully ascertain the situation in the countryside, and understand the actual needs of agricultural cooperatives for personnel. How many people can be placed, when will they go to the countryside, and how will the problems of accommodation, meals, joining the cooperative, cooperative foundation, labor and study be solved after going to the countryside? Agreements need to be reached with the relevant agricultural cooperatives, and they cannot be sent to the countryside blindly. Students who grow up in cities lack labor habits, and their labor income in the early stages of going to the countryside will not be very high. Therefore, their actual difficulties must be considered in advance. When Wuhan organized the first batch of students to go to the countryside for production, the mosquito nets, bedding, daily necessities, etc. of students with difficult family circumstances were solved with the assistance of neighborhood committees and relatives of students; the accommodation, meals, joining the cooperative, cooperative foundation, pocket money and other issues of students after arriving at the agricultural cooperative were negotiated with the agricultural cooperative the students went to, and the agricultural cooperative specifically studied and solved them. All localities can refer to this experience and find appropriate solutions according to the specific circumstances.
    Primary and secondary school graduates whose homes are in the countryside generally want to return to the countryside to participate in production; however, some primary and secondary school graduates whose homes are in the countryside see the difference between rural and urban life, dislike "the hard life in the countryside," "no future," and so on, and are unwilling to return to the countryside to participate in production. These erroneous ideas should also be analyzed and criticized, and youths should be persuaded to consciously and happily return to build a beautiful countryside.
    Time is already very tight, and all localities should seize the ideological and political work of graduates and students' parents, establish correct social public opinion, and overcome various obstacles to primary and secondary school graduates participating in agricultural production. Doing a good job in arranging for this year's graduates of primary and secondary schools who cannot continue their studies is not only of great importance to whether they can happily go to the agricultural production posts, but also to stabilizing the production emotions of rural youths, especially rural educated youths, and encouraging future graduates to participate in agricultural production.

### 妥善安排中小学毕业生下乡

    妥善安排中小学毕业生下乡
    今年的暑假就要开始了。暑假以后，大量不能升学的中小学毕业生需要安排。怎样安排呢？基本的办法有两条：第一是动员说服家在农村的学生回乡参加农业生产；家在城市的学生，如果不能在家自学，而在城市又无法安排的，也尽可能说服和安排他们到农村从事农业劳动。第二是依靠群众和社会团体，在自愿的原则下，采取各种形式，吸收不能升学的学生继续学习，等待就业或升学。
    动员不能升学的中小学毕业生到农村参加农业生产，或者组织他们自学，等待就业和升学，是国家在今后相当长的时间内所采取的根本方针。这是因为新中国普通教育的目的，主要是培养有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的体力劳动者；其次才是为培养专门人才打下普通知识的基础。中小学生毕业后不能升学，就去从事生产劳动，这是理所当然的正常现象。在一定时期内，我国工矿企业增加工人是不会很多的。由于去年职工人数增加过多，现在工矿企业等职工还有多余。城市某些服务行业、手工业虽然能吸收一部分人，但是数目很有限。因此，对于不能升学的中小学毕业生，参加农业生产是一个主要的出路。
    中小学毕业生参加农业生产是光荣的事情。毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中指出：“我国是一个大农业国，农业人口占全国人口的百分之八十以上，发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。”农业在实现合作化以后，将愈来愈需要有文化的劳动力。因此，动员不能升学的中小学毕业生参加农业生产，是对于国家社会主义建设有重大意义的事情。知识青年如果对这方面有足够的认识，一定会踊跃地到农村去参加农业生产。
    知识青年应该认识到，只有决心参加工农业生产，同工农群众打成一片，才能够站稳劳动人民的立场，使自己真正成为新型的知识分子。在这次反右派斗争中，我们看到，许多旧知识分子，由于过去没有参加过体力劳动，轻视劳动人民，因此，他们当中有一部分人经不起社会主义革命斗争的考验，成了反社会主义的右派分子。今天的知识青年，应该从这个历史事实中接受教训，努力参加生产劳动，首先是体力劳动，到工农群众中去锻炼自己，使自己成为坚强的社会主义的建设者，成为忠实的社会主义的战士。
    动员中小学毕业生参加农业生产，是一件细致的思想教育工作，必须采取说服的方法，帮助学生解决具体的思想问题。目前许多应届毕业生如果不能升学，到农村参加农业生产，从道理上讲他们是可能接受的。但是，由于他们久居城市，不了解农村情况，他们对于下乡参加农业生产还有许多疑问。例如，农村究竟苦不苦，下乡去做什么，参加农业生产每天能得到多少报酬，能不能养家，农村有没有学习和文化娱乐活动，等等。因此，对于不能升学而准备参加农业生产的毕业生的宣传教育工作，除了讲清楚必要的道理以外，学校和家长还应当针对他们提出的具体问题，进行认真的宣传解释工作。要告诉学生，下乡生产是有困难的，农村生活条件比城市要差，下乡首先是学习做一个农民，应当有决心吃苦和克服困难的思想准备，下乡之后要同农民搞好关系，不应当占农民的便宜。学校还可以组织学生到农业合作社参观，使他们了解农民的真实生活和农村的状况。在这方面，武汉市组织中小学毕业生参加农业生产的做法，是很好的。武汉市今年5月中旬组织了将近九百个自学青年，分三批到郊区农业合作社参观访问，同农民同吃、同住，并且每天同农民一起从事六至八小时的农业劳动。通过这些活动，改变了学生和家长原来对农村的不正确看法，许多人自愿到农村安家落户。这样，真正做到了学生自愿，家长同意。
    城市组织毕业生下乡生产，还需要做好调查研究工作，认真地查明农村情况，了解农业合作社用人的实际需要。究竟能够安置多少人，什么时候下乡，下乡后住宿、吃饭、入社、入社基金、劳动和学习等问题如何解决，都需要同有关的农业社达成协议，不能盲目地往乡下一送了事。生长在城市的学生，由于缺少劳动习惯，下乡初期的劳动收入还不会很多；因此，对于他们的实际困难必须预先有所考虑。武汉市组织第一批学生下乡生产的时候，对于家境困难的学生的蚊帐、被褥、日常用品等是依靠居民委员、学生亲属等协助解决的；学生到农业社之后的住宿、吃饭、入社、入社基金、零用钱等问题，是与学生所到的农业合作社协商，由农业社具体研究解决的。各地可以参考这一经验，按照具体情况，找出适当的办法。
    家在农村的中小学毕业生，一般是愿意回到农村参加生产的；但是，也有一部分家在农村的中小学毕业生，看到农村与城市生活的差别，嫌“农村生活苦”，“没有前途”，等等，因而不愿意回农村参加生产。对于这些错误思想，也应该进行分析批判，说服青年自觉地愉快地回去建设美丽的乡土。
    时间已经很紧迫了，各地应当抓紧对毕业生和学生家长的思想政治工作，树立正确的社会舆论，克服各种阻挠中小学毕业生参加农业生产的障碍。做好今年中小学不能升学的毕业生的安排工作，不仅是对于他们能否愉快地走向农业生产的岗位有重大关系，而且对于安定农村青年特别是农村知识青年的生产情绪，以及鼓励今后毕业生参加农业生产，也将发生重大的影响。
