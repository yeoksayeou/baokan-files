Xinhua News Agency, July 11th: Mongolian Ambassador to China, Rubsan, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 36th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception.

Speaking at the reception, Vice Chairman Zhu De extended warm fraternal congratulations to the government and people of the Mongolian People's Republic. He said that after thirty-six years of arduous struggle and diligent effort, the Mongolian people have achieved great successes in the cause of building socialism. The Chinese people have always regarded every achievement of the Mongolian people as their own victory and are encouraged by it.

Vice Chairman Zhu De added that under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government, the Mongolian people have made unremitting efforts to strengthen the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In recent years, the Mongolian People's Republic has also established diplomatic relations with many Asian countries that are peaceful and neutral, such as India, Burma, and Indonesia. This has strengthened cooperation with Asian countries and peoples who love peace and has made beneficial contributions to safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

Vice Chairman Zhu De spoke of the long-standing friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples and the increasing development of mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries in various fields such as politics, economy, culture, and science over the past eight years. Friendly exchanges between the governments and peoples of the two countries have become increasingly frequent. He said that these fully demonstrate the close unity between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples.

He wished the Mongolian people even greater achievements in building their motherland and safeguarding the cause of lasting world peace.

Ambassador Rubsan said at the beginning of the reception that in the past thirty-six years, the people and government of our country have resolutely pursued a policy of peace. With the selfless assistance of the people of our great friend, the Soviet Union, we have consolidated the power of national independence and achieved brilliant victories in all aspects of the country's political, economic, and cultural life. Especially in recent years, with the support of socialist countries, we have eliminated the backward conditions left over from many years of feudalism and achieved brilliant achievements in the cause of building socialism in our motherland.

He said that the economic and cultural relations between Mongolia and China have achieved great development. The great Chinese people, their government, and the glorious Chinese Communist Party have provided Mongolia with enormous economic assistance. The Mongolian people and government express their deep friendship and heartfelt gratitude for this.

He also congratulated the Chinese people on achieving new and even more brilliant victories in the cause of building socialism.

During the banquet, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and Ambassador Rubsan frequently proposed toasts to the unbreakable friendship between Mongolia and China, to the increasing prosperity and happiness of Mongolia and China, to lasting world peace, to the strong unity of the socialist camp, and to the health of the national and party leaders of Mongolia and China.
