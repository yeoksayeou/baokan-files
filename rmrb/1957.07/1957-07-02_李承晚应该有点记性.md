Syngman Rhee Should Have Some Memory
By People's Daily Commentator

After the United States openly announced its violation of Article 13 of the Korean Armistice Agreement and its intention to transport new weapons into South Korea, Syngman Rhee, sitting on his throne propped up by American bayonets, upon hearing the news, expressed "great agreement" and "great gratitude," and clamored to "fight bravely" to solve the so-called "Communist problem." This is truly a case of "when someone plays the flute, someone dances."

It's not the first time Syngman Rhee has clamored for war. Every time the United States wants to violate the Korean Armistice Agreement and create tension in Korea, Syngman Rhee comes out like a madman to yell and scream. Now that the United States is openly violating the main terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement, he is clamoring for "unification of Korea by force," demanding the complete tearing up of the Armistice Agreement, and openly advocating for turning South Korea into an American atomic war base. Syngman Rhee's subservient appearance is truly a sight to behold. As for Syngman Rhee offering advice to the United States, saying that the United States does not want to lose the entire Asian continent like it lost mainland China, and that the "wisest policy" for the United States is to strengthen his army, and that this is "very economical," this even more clearly demonstrates his identity: an American watchdog in South Korea.

Syngman Rhee and his master, the United States, have both used force in Korea. What was the result? The Syngman Rhee army and the so-called "United Nations forces," which started their invasion north from the 38th parallel, had to retreat back to where they launched their aggression after fighting for three years, and were still forced to sit down and negotiate. When Syngman Rhee strikes a "teacher" pose and clamors about "force," he should have some memory and remember the lessons the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteers taught him.

The Korean people and the Chinese people both love peace. The Chinese government fully agrees with the proposal of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to convene an international conference with broad participation of relevant countries in order to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean question. The three-year Korean War has proved that American napalm bombs and even bacteriological weapons are of no help to the "unification by force" that Syngman Rhee clamors for. Now, to try to frighten the Korean people with atomic weapons, history will prove that this is just a fantasy.

However, war mongers and their running dogs also have madness, and we must be vigilant.

    李承晚应该有点记性
    本报评论员
    在美国公然宣布破坏朝鲜停战协定第十三款、要把新武器运进南朝鲜以后，坐在美国刺刀支架起来的宝座上的李承晚，闻讯之下，表示“非常同意”，“非常感激”，并且又叫嚣要“奋起作战”来解决所谓“共产党问题”了。这真是所谓“有人吹笛子就有人跳舞”。
    李承晚叫嚣战争已经不是第一次了。当美国每次想要破坏朝鲜停战协定、在朝鲜制造紧张局势的时候，李承晚就像疯子一样要出来大叫大嚷一番。现在当美国公然破坏朝鲜停战协定的主要条款的时候，他又来叫嚷“武力统一朝鲜”，要求全面撕毁停战协定，并公然主张把南朝鲜充作美国的原子战争基地。李承晚的一付奴才相也就十足可观了。至于李承晚为美国献策，说美国不想像失去中国大陆一样失去整个亚洲，对美国来说，“最明智的政策”是加强他的军队，并且说这是“很经济的”，这就更加清楚地表明了他的身份：美国在南朝鲜的一条看门狗。
    武力，李承晚和他的主子美国在朝鲜是都使用过了的。结果如何呢？从三八线开始向北进犯的李承晚军队和所谓“联合国军”，在打了三年之后，仍然不得不退回到它们发动侵略的地方，仍然不得不被迫坐下来谈判。李承晚在摆出一付“教师爷”架式叫嚷什么“武力”的时候，应该有点记性，应该记得朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军给他的教训。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民都是热爱和平的。中国政府完全同意朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出的召开有关国家广泛参加的国际会议的建议，以便谋求和平统一朝鲜问题的解决。三年的朝鲜战争已经证明：美制凝固汽油弹乃至细菌武器，都无助于李承晚所叫嚷的“武力统一”。现在又想用原子武器来把朝鲜人民吓倒，历史将会证明，这只是一个幻想。
    然而，战争贩子和他的走狗也有疯狂性，我们不能不提高警惕。
