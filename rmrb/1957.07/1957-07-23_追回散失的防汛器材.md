    Recover Lost Flood Control Materials
    (Our report) The “Minwan Repair and Prevention Association” in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, prepared a batch of flood control materials last year (including thousands of pieces of tree branches, bamboo mats, sacks, and coir ropes). These were stored in specialized houses in the Shuanghe Cooperative of Shuangjiangkou Township, the Yuanzhou Cooperative of Quantang Township, and the Liming Cooperative, all well-placed in readiness for the flood season. However, a large part of these materials has now been lost. Now that the flood season has arrived, the members of these cooperatives should quickly return the flood control materials.

    追回散失的防汛器材
    本报讯　湖南宁乡县的“民垸修防会”去年准备了一批防汛器材（内有树条、晒簟、麻袋、棕索等共几千件），分别放在双江口乡的双河社，黎明社泉塘乡的园洲社，都用专门房子放置得很好，以备汛期之用。可是，现在这些器材已失掉了很大一部分。现在已到汛期，这些地方的社员应该快把防汛物资交回来。　（姜凤鸣　黄小似）
