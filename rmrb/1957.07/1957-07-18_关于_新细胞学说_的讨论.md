    Discussion on the "New Cell Theory"

    In 1950, the Soviet scientist Olga Lepeshinskaya proposed the "New Cell Theory." She believed that cells originated from "living matter," and that living matter without cellular form could develop into cells under certain conditions. Her main experimental basis was: ground hydra cells could regenerate into cells; egg yolk spheres of bird eggs could develop into cells; during animal wound healing, new cells formed from living matter, and so on. In other words, cells not only reproduce through cell division but can also be formed from living matter that does not have a cellular form, such as the "living matter" of disintegrated cells. This theory was once accepted by scientists in the Soviet Union and China. However, scientists did not obtain the same results when repeating Lepeshinskaya's experiments; thus, discussions began in the Soviet Union in 1953.

    Chinese scientists also have different views on Lepeshinskaya's theory. Recently, the "Acta Anatomica Sinica," "Acta Biologiae Experimentalis Sinica," "Kexue Tongbao (Chinese Science Bulletin)," and "Biology Bulletin," published by the Science Press, have published several papers presenting different viewpoints and experimental results.

    In response to the hydra aspect, one of the main bases of the "New Cell Theory," Wu Zhaofa's paper "A Re-examination of the 'Development of Hydra Protoplasm' Problem" ("Acta Anatomica Sinica," Vol. 1, No. 4) presents a counter-argument. According to the author's observation, what Lepeshinskaya described as "cells" were actually the fat globules of water fleas or copepods eaten by the hydra. These fat globules, under the action of hydrolysis and oxidation, could form vacuoles that resembled cells. The author compared ground hydra that had been fed water fleas and copepods with hydra that had been starved for several days or not fed these foods, and found that the latter did not develop fat globules. The author also found that these vacuoles resembling "cells" could be produced even when ground hydra cells were subjected to life-killing conditions, such as high temperature or "Formalin" treatment, thus proving that it was only a physical and chemical process, not a life development process.

    In response to the yolk sphere development aspect, Xue Shepu and Pu Yisen's "Study on the 'Cell Formation from Yolk Spheres' Problem During Chicken Embryo Development" ("Acta Anatomica Sinica," Vol. 2, No. 1), and Wu Zhaofa's "Using New Staining Methods to Reveal that Chicken Yolk Spheres Do Not Form Cells" ("Kexue Tongbao," 1957, No. 3) and other papers present counter-arguments. Xue and Pu mainly studied the changes in yolk spheres in the subgerminal cavity and between the inner and outer two germ layers; they also studied the origin of blood islands and the formation process of blood cells and blood vessels. In their experimental process, they did not find the phenomenon described by Lepeshinskaya that yolk spheres could develop into cells or blood islands. They found that yolk spheres were the embryo's nutrients, and did not have life characteristics themselves, and were ultimately decomposed and liquefied. Although yolk spheres in the subgerminal cavity and between the two germ layers could sometimes gradually decompose into granules or droplets, they were ultimately not living cells. In particular, by adopting the method of local cauterization of the blastodisc, they found that blood islands still formed from the mesoderm reaching the cauterized area; while outside the cauterized area, blood islands could not form because the mesoderm was blocked by the cauterized area. This proved that blood islands originated from the mesoderm, and also disproved Lepeshinskaya's claim that yolk spheres develop into blood island cells. In Wu Zhaofa's article, a new staining method was proposed that could stain yolk spheres and cell nuclei with completely different colors, facilitating experimental observation and distinction. He similarly proved that yolk spheres in the subgerminal cavity of chicken embryos did not form endoderm cells, and that yolk spheres between the two germ layers falling into the blood island area did not form blood island cells.

    Regarding wound healing, Zhu Run's two papers on "Studies on Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration" ("Acta Biologiae Experimentalis Sinica," Vol. 5, No. 2) also mentioned different arguments against Lepeshinskaya's theory. In the first paper, a histological study of the skin excision wound healing process in white mice, the author believes that it is difficult to explain the formation of new epidermal tissue from his own experiments using the development of "living matter." In the second paper, a study on the regeneration method of striated muscle fibers, the author said that he did not find, in his experiments, the process observed by Lepeshinskaya et al.: that the nucleoplasm broken down from cells could develop into the nucleus of muscle cells, and then further form muscle cells. Instead, the author believes that the formation of muscle cells is developed from the residual muscle nuclei and the surrounding sarcoplasm after the degeneration of the contractile substance of the injured muscle fibers.

    Although these scientists obtained completely different results from Lepeshinskaya in their experiments, they unanimously believe that Lepeshinskaya's starting point is still correct: the earliest life with cellular form must have developed from living matter that did not have a cellular form. The question is whether, under today's conditions, life can already be produced by the complete reproductive function of organisms, and whether it is still necessary to re-enact the lower form of primitive life development, which needs to be proven by facts.

### 关于“新细胞学说”的讨论

    关于“新细胞学说”的讨论
    苏联勒柏辛斯卡娅于1950年提出了“新细胞学说”；她认为细胞起源于“生活物质”，不具备细胞形态的生活物质，在一定条件下都可以演发为细胞。她的主要实验根据是：磨碎了的水螅细胞能重新演发成细胞；鸟卵营养物质的卵黄球能演发成细胞；动物创伤愈合时，从生活物质形成了新的细胞，等等。也就是说，细胞不仅通过细胞分裂的方式进行繁殖，还可以通过不具备细胞形态的生活物质，例如解体了的细胞的“生活物质”形成细胞。这个学说，曾一度为苏联和我国科学家所接受。但科学家们在重复勒柏辛斯卡娅的实验时，并没有得到相同的结果；于是从1953年起，在苏联展开了讨论。
    我国科学家对勒柏辛斯卡娅的学说也有着不同的看法。在科学出版社最近出版的“解剖学报”、“实验生物学报”、“科学通报”和“生物学通报”中，刊登了一些论文，提出不同的观点和实验结果。
    针对“新细胞学说”主要根据之一的水螅方面提出反证的，有武兆发“对‘水螅活质的演发’一问题的重新研究”（“解剖学报”一卷四期）的论文。据作者的观察，被勒柏辛斯卡娅所描述成“细胞”的，实际上是被水螅吃了的水蚤或剑水蚤的脂肪球，这种脂肪球在水解和氧化作用下，能形成貌似细胞的空泡；作者并把喂过水蚤、剑水蚤的水螅同饿了几日或不喂此类食物的水螅磨碎后作了比较，发现后者没有脂肪球发生。作者又把磨碎了的水螅细胞在能杀死生命的条件下，如经高温或“福尔马林”的处理，发现也能产生这种貌似“细胞”的空泡，因此证明它只是一种物理化学过程，并非生命的演发过程。
    针对卵黄球演发方面提出反证的，有薛社普和蒲以森的“鸡胚发育期中‘细胞从卵黄球形成’问题的研究”（“解剖学报”二卷一期），以及武兆发的“用新的染色方法揭示鸡卵黄球并不形成细胞”（“科学通报”1957年第三期）等论文。薛、蒲二人主要研究胚下腔和进入内外二胚层间的卵黄球的变化；同时对血岛的来源，以及血细胞、血管的形成过程也作了研究。在他们的实验过程中，并没发现勒柏辛斯卡娅所描述的卵黄球可以演变为细胞或血岛的现象。他们发现，卵黄球是胚胎的营养物质，本身并没有生命的特征，最后是被分解和液化；虽然卵黄球在胚下腔和二胚层间，有时能逐渐分解为颗粒或小滴状，但终究不是有生命的细胞。特别是采取了胚盘局部烧灼的方法，发现从中胚层到达烧灼区，仍然有血岛的形成；而烧灼区以外，由于和中胚层被烧灼区所阻，不能形成血岛。这证明血岛来源于中胚层，也反证了勒柏辛斯卡娅关于卵黄球演变为血岛细胞的说法。在武兆发的文章中，提出了一种新的染色方法，能够把卵黄球和细胞核染上完全不同的颜色，便于实验观察和区别；他同样证明鸡胚的胚下腔中的卵黄球并不形成内胚层细胞，落入血岛区的二胚层间的卵黄球也不形成血岛细胞。
    至于创伤愈合方面，在朱润的“创伤愈合和组织再生的研究”（“实验生物学报”五卷二期）的两篇论文中，也提到了对勒柏辛斯卡娅的不同论点。在第一篇关于白鼠皮肤切除创伤愈合过程的组织学研究中，作者认为从自己的实验中，很难用“生活物质”的演发来说明新生表皮组织的形成。在第二篇关于横纹肌纤维的再生方式的研究中，作者说在他的实验中并没有发现如勒柏辛斯卡娅等所观察到的：从细胞瓦解下来的核质，可以演化成肌细胞的核，再进而形成肌细胞的过程。而作者认为肌细胞的形成，是从受伤肌纤维的收缩物质退化后所遗留的肌核和它四周的肌浆发育而成的。
    虽然这些位科学家同勒柏辛斯卡娅在实验上得到完全不同的结果，但他们一致认为勒柏辛斯卡娅的出发点还是正确的，最初的有细胞形态的生命必然是从不具备细胞形态的生活物质发展而成。问题在于在今天的条件下，生命已可由生物的完备的繁殖机能来产生，是否还需要按照原始的生命发展的低级形态来重演，这就需要事实来证明。
