    Hebei Achieves Decisive Victory in Locust Extermination
    (Our newspaper's Baoding dispatch, 30th) Reporter Lu Sheng reports: Hebei Province has achieved a decisive victory in its locust extermination work. According to statistics from the Provincial Department of Agriculture on June 28th, over 2,993,000 mu of land throughout the province have been treated to eliminate locusts.
    Currently, apart from some areas that are still continuing large-scale extermination efforts, most areas have entered the stage of re-treatment and residual cleaning.
    In this locust extermination work, due to the personal involvement of leaders at all levels, the mobilization of the masses, the vigorous organization of medicine and machinery transportation, and the strengthening of technical guidance, the locust control work quickly became proactive. In the struggle to eliminate locusts, many areas carried out mutual support between neighboring districts and townships. The central government's dispatch of aircraft to help control locusts also boosted the enthusiasm of the masses in the locust-affected areas.
    The current issues that should be paid attention to in the locust extermination work are: for the few areas that do not meet the drug treatment standards, timely measures should be taken to eliminate them thoroughly through manual capture or manual picking. Attention should also be paid to sweeping up the remnants in the areas that have been treated once; attention should be paid to the activities and egg-laying of the residual locusts, and preparations should be made for the elimination of autumn locusts.

    河北灭蝗取得决定性胜利
    本报保定30日电　记者鲁生报道：河北省的灭蝗工作已取得了决定性的胜利。据省农业厅6月28日统计，全省已除治蝗虫二百九十九万三千余亩。
    目前除部分地区还在大规模地继续除治外，大部地区已进入复治、扫残肃清阶段中。
    在这次灭蝗工作中，由于各级领导干部亲自动手，发动群众、大力组织药械运输，以及加强技术指导，使治蝗工作很快转入主动。在除治蝗虫的斗争中，不少地区都进行了邻区邻乡的互相支援。中央派飞机帮助治蝗也鼓舞了蝗区群众的灭蝗情绪。
    目前灭蝗工作应该注意的问题是对少数不够药治标准的地区，要及时采取人工捕打或人工拾零的办法作到彻底消灭。在除治一遍的地区还要注意扫残；要注意残蝗的活动和产卵的情况，作好秋蝗的除治准备。
