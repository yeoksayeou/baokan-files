Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 11th: Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, who is currently visiting Korea, held a grand banquet in Pyongyang on July 10th.

Premier Kim Il-sung, Chairman Kim Tu-bong, other leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and government, and responsible persons from various democratic parties and social organizations attended the banquet. Diplomatic envoys of various countries to Korea also attended the banquet.

President Ho Chi Minh announced at the banquet that Premier Kim Il-sung had accepted the invitation to visit the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

President Ho Chi Minh said that the people of Vietnam and Korea both live in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. They are both struggling for the unification of their motherlands and advancing on the road of building socialism. The people of both countries still face difficulties, but under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, relying on their own efforts and the support of peace-loving people around the world, they will surely achieve victory. He finally proposed a toast to the ever-strengthening and developing friendship between Vietnam and Korea, and to the health of Premier Kim Il-sung and Chairman Kim Tu-bong.

Premier Kim Il-sung then spoke at the banquet, saying that President Ho Chi Minh's visit to Korea is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the friendship and solidarity between the people of the two countries. He said that the enemy is intensifying tensions in Asia and continuing to carry out sabotage activities in an attempt to disintegrate the unity and solidarity within our ranks, but no conspiracy of the enemy can shake the revolutionary ranks of the people united under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, nor can it make us retreat a step from the great road to socialism.

He said that the people of Korea and Vietnam are more closely united because of their common ideology, common goals, and the common situation of the two countries being divided into North and South.

Premier Kim Il-sung finally proposed a toast to the solidarity of the socialist camp, to the friendship and solidarity of the people of Korea and Vietnam, and to the health of President Ho Chi Minh.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 11th: Korean Central News Agency reported: Leaders of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and leaders of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party held talks in Pyongyang today.
