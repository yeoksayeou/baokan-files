    Mantises Trying to Stop a Chariot
    Zhu Yiqing
    Zhuangzi said: "Don't you know about the praying mantis? It raises its arms to stop the chariot wheel, not knowing it is incapable of doing so." Han Shi Waizhuan says: "Duke Zhuang of Qi went hunting and saw a mantis raising its legs to strike the wheel. He asked his driver. The driver said: 'This insect only knows to advance and not to retreat, not measuring its strength but lightly engaging the enemy. Its intent is clear.' Yet, this tiny mantis, how arrogant it is, daring to stop a chariot, not knowing it will die? Thinking about it again and again, I finally understood: 'The mantis is an insect, not human, hence ignorant.'"
    However, today, right-wing elements, though not insects, are even more ignorant than mantises. Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Chu Anping… and the like, along with the small group of bourgeois right-wingers who cheer them on, seize the opportunity of the Communist Party's rectification campaign to bare their fangs, wave their claws, stir up trouble, and do everything possible to incite the masses,妄想想 the world will descend into chaos so they can take over. Alas, the Communist Party remains as solid as a rock. The Communist Party has shortcomings, but just as the sun has sunspots, the right-wing gentlemen close their eyes and shout: "The sunspots have swallowed the sun!" But the people, after all, always have their eyes open. They see the sunspots, and even more so, they see the sun, because the sun's light is so strong!
    Today, on the road to socialism, anyone who wants to turn the wheel of history back to capitalism is wasting their time. The right-wing gentlemen overestimate themselves and insist on waving their arms to stop the chariot; I fear their fate will not be much better than that of the mantis.

    螳臂当车
    朱一清
    庄子曰：“女不知夫螳螂乎，怒臂以当车辙，不知其不胜任也”。韩诗外载：“齐庄公出猎，有螳螂举足将搏其轮。问其御。御曰：‘其为虫也，知进而不知退，不量力而轻就敌。其意显然’。然区区螳螂，何其狂妄，胆敢当车，岂不知死也？思之再三，久而悟曰：‘螳虫也，非人，无知故也’。”
    然而今天，右派分子虽非虫蟹，却比螳螂更加无知，章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、储安平……之流，及其摇旗呐喊的一小撮资产阶级右派分子，乘共产党整风之际，张牙舞爪，兴风作浪，百般煽动群众，妄想天下将乱，取而代之也。可惜共产党仍然坚如磐石，共产党有缺点，但正如太阳有黑斑，右派先生们闭着眼睛疾呼：“黑斑吞没了太阳”。但人民毕竟始终张着眼睛的。他们看到黑斑，更看到太阳，因为太阳的光芒是那样强烈啊！
    今天，在社会主义的道路上，谁想把历史的车轮扭向资本主义，这是枉费心机的，右派先生们不自量力，一定要摇臂当车，恐怕他们的命运是不会比螳螂强多少的。
