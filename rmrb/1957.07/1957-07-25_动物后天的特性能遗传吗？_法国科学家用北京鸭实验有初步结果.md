Xinhua News Agency, July 24th, Paris Dispatch: A group of French scientists, headed by biology professor Jacques Benoît, recently announced the preliminary results of their genetic experiments using Peking ducks. They altered certain traits of the Peking ducks through injection, and approximately 70% of the offspring of these ducks inherited the altered traits from their mothers.

In April of this year, these French scientists injected deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into the bodies of twelve ordinary Peking ducks. As a result, these Peking ducks acquired certain traits of Khaki Campbell ducks. There were significant changes in the color of their beaks and feathers, their size, the shape of their heads and bodies, and the way they walked. Twenty-six ducklings were hatched from the eggs of these injected Peking ducks, and approximately 70% of these ducklings retained the newly acquired traits of their mothers. For example, the beaks and feet of Peking ducks are originally orange-yellow, but the injected Peking ducks and their offspring did not develop this pigmentation.

Professor Benoît believes that if his findings can be applied to humans, it would have a profound impact, potentially increasing human resistance to certain diseases. Some French scientists believe that this discovery is one of the most important in biology, as no one has previously managed to induce "controlled" mutations in higher animals.

    动物后天的特性能遗传吗？
    法国科学家用北京鸭实验有初步结果
    新华社24日讯　巴黎消息：以生物学教授雅克·贝诺瓦为首的一批法国科学家最近宣布了他们用北京鸭做遗传学实验的初步结果，他们用注射方法改变了北京鸭的某些特性，这些鸭子的后一代约有70％把母代改变了的特性遗传下来。
    这些法国科学家在今年4月间把脱氧核糖核酸注射到十二只普通北京鸭的身体中去，结果这些北京鸭就具有卡基鸭的某些特性，它们嘴和羽毛的颜色、它们的大小、头和身体的形状以及它们走路的样子都发生了显著的变化。用这些经过注射的北京鸭的蛋孵出了二十六只小鸭，其中约有70％的小鸭保存了母代新得到的特性。例如，北京鸭的嘴和脚原来是橙黄色的，注射后的北京鸭和它的下一代就没有色素形成。
    贝诺瓦教授认为，如果他的发现能应用在人身上，那末就会有深远的影响，可能增加人对某些疾病的抵抗力。有的法国科学家认为，这个发现是生物学上最重要的发现之一，以前还没有人设法使高级动物发生“有控制的”突变。
