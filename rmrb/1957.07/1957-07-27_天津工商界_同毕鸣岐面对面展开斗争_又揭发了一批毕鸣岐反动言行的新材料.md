Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 26th. Yesterday, industrial and commercial figures in Tianjin launched their first face-to-face struggle against Bi Mingqi, a fellow traveler of Zhang Naiqi. After Bi Mingqi was criticized by many industrial and commercial figures at the joint meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association in Beijing, the meeting decided to let him return to Tianjin for a serious self-criticism and confession. However, at yesterday's joint meeting of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Bi Mingqi only vaguely admitted that "I am a person who has committed serious mistakes and should bow my head and confess my guilt to the Party and the people." He did not seriously examine his specific words and deeds against the Party and against socialism, which aroused great dissatisfaction among the participants. After his entire self-criticism was completed, in just over an hour, twenty-four people scrambled to expose and denounce his reactionary words and deeds. Tang Baoxin exposed another batch of new materials about the inextricable links between Bi Mingqi and Zhang Naiqi. Tang said: "Last year, when the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association criticized Zhang Naiqi's erroneous ideas, Bi Mingqi played a double-dealing trick. He agreed to criticize Zhang Naiqi on the spot, but finally said to me: 'Zhang Naiqi is too unwise. If I were him, I would make a self-criticism at the meeting to guarantee everyone's satisfaction, and after the meeting, I would do whatever I wanted.' A document drafted by the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association decided to criticize Zhang Naiqi's arguments. During the discussion process, Bi Mingqi said to Tang Baoxin and others: 'Let them discuss it, we will revise it.' He even deleted the main points of criticizing Zhang Naiqi."
    Wan Guoquan exposed the fact that Bi Mingqi slandered the Party's policies. Bi Mingqi once said: "The General Line is a lighthouse. When you get to the bottom of the lighthouse, the money will be gone." He also said: "This lighthouse is the lighthouse outside Dagu Port, it goes on and off." When the constitution was promulgated, Bi Mingqi said, "Today there is a constitution, but no criminal law. The leaders say a word and people are arrested. What is the use of the constitution?" Wang Zhizhou and Wang Jinbiao exposed that during the Five-Anti Campaign, Bi Mingqi had spread rumors saying: "The materials of the Five-Anti Campaign are based on suspicion. A label is attached and it's done, the government doesn't even investigate." After the Five-Anti Campaign, at a meeting of the Tianjin China Democratic National Construction Association, Bi Mingqi shook hands with everyone and said: "You have been wronged in the Five-Anti Campaign."

    天津工商界
    同毕鸣岐面对面展开斗争
    又揭发了一批毕鸣岐反动言行的新材料
    新华社天津26日电　昨天，天津市工商业者同章乃器的同路人——毕鸣岐展开了第一次的面对面的斗争。毕鸣岐在北京全国工商联和民建中央常委联席会议上受到全国许多工商业者的批判后，会议确定让他回天津认真地检讨和交代。可是毕鸣岐在昨天举行的天津市工商联和民建常委联席会议上，只是空洞地承认“我是一个犯了严重错误的人，应该向党向人民低头认罪。”没有认真地检查自己反党反社会主义的具体的言行，因而遭到与会者极大的不满。在他的检讨全部作完以后，只一个多小时的时间内，有二十四人争先揭发和指责他的反动言行。唐宝心揭发了毕鸣岐和章乃器千丝万缕的联系中的又一批新的材料。唐说：“去年民建二中全会批判章乃器的错误思想时，毕鸣岐耍两面派手法，当场同意批判章乃器，最后却对我说：‘章乃器太不智，要是我就在会上检讨一番，保管大家满意，会后我该怎么办还是怎么办。’民建中央在起草的一个文件中曾决定批判章乃器的论点，在大家讨论过程中，毕鸣岐找唐宝心等人说：‘叫他们讨论去吧，我们来改’。他竟把批判章乃器的主要地方都改掉了。”
    万国权揭发了毕鸣岐污蔑党的政策的事实，毕鸣岐曾说：“总路线是灯塔，等走到灯塔底下钱就光了。”又说：“这个灯塔是大沽口外的灯塔，一会着一会灭。”宪法公布时，毕鸣岐说：“今天有宪法，但没刑法，领导上说一句话就抓人，宪法有什么用？”王芷洲、王金标揭发毕鸣岐在五反的时候，毕曾造谣说：“五反的材料是怀疑来的，扣个帽子就办了，政府也不调查。”在五反以后，天津市民建召开的一次会议上，毕鸣岐和大家一一握手说：“你们在五反中受屈了。”
