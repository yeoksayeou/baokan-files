    Promptly Improve Work and Consolidate Rectification Achievements
    Many Universities and Colleges in Beijing Implement the Spirit of Rectification and Correction Simultaneously

    This newspaper reports that the Party committees of many universities and colleges in Beijing have seriously handled the criticisms and opinions raised by the masses during the rectification movement, implementing the spirit of rectification and correction simultaneously.
    Regarding the issue of rank, some Party members felt that their ranks had been assessed too high, and they voluntarily requested the Party organization to consider lowering them. After careful study, the Party committees of each school officially announced their agreement to the requests of some individuals, lowering their ranks from July. Four comrades from the Beijing Institute of Mining, three from the Beijing Russian Language Institute, and seven each from the Beijing Petroleum Institute and the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute had their ranks lowered.
    Regarding the issue of welfare subsidies, the rectification offices of each school established welfare inspection teams to conduct investigations and research. Now, according to the plans proposed by the welfare inspection teams of each school, the Party committees of each school announced that those who received unreasonable welfare subsidies would have them deducted in installments from July. Some Party cadres have already voluntarily returned welfare subsidies to the public for disposal. The Beijing Institute of Technology had not published the expenditure of welfare subsidies for more than a year, and it has now been decided to publish the expenditure of welfare subsidies once a month.
    Regarding housing allocation, many universities and colleges have established special research groups to formulate plans for reforming housing allocation and have begun to solve the problem of unreasonable housing. For example, the Beijing Institute of Geology and the Beijing Institute of Mining have converted sheds into temporary housing to solve the problem of insufficient dormitory space. Gao Yunsheng, President of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, and Vice President Wei Jingchang, and Wu Zimu, Vice President of the Beijing Institute of Mining, voluntarily gave up their houses or made adjustments.
    The schools are also working to improve the learning conditions for cadres and teaching equipment. The Beijing Medical College has put forward preliminary suggestions on the training and improvement of cadres at all levels, which will be submitted to the departments and teaching hospitals for the formulation of plans, and finally approved and implemented by the college.
    Students in the Marxism-Leninism Research Class of the Central Institute for Nationalities requested that lecture notes and materials on the modern history of the Chinese revolution be printed. After research by the leadership, it was decided to print an additional 200,000 words of materials and 300,000 words of lecture notes in addition to the original 800,000 words, and to purchase revolutionary history charts. Professor Shi Xinpu of the Department of Metallurgy at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology pointed out that the problem of the laboratory oxygen cylinder isolation room had not been solved in the past, which affected work, and improvements have now begun.
    In the past, the Beijing Institute of Technology and the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology had some inappropriate practices in the work assignments and other aspects of non-Party cadres, which are now being corrected. A nursery worker at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology was later transferred to a training factory as an apprentice. Everyone felt that her work assignment was inappropriate, and it has been decided to transfer her back to her original unit.
    In addition, unreasonable phenomena in general life in various schools are also being gradually resolved.
    Because some of the problems raised by the broad masses of non-Party members in the movement have been solved in a timely manner, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been gradually improved, and the enthusiasm of the masses to help the Party in the rectification movement has been further stimulated. At present, the schools are continuing to solve the problems that everyone has already raised.

    及时改进工作　巩固整风成果
    北京许多高等学校贯彻边整边改的精神
    本报讯　北京许多高等学校的党委会，对群众在整风中所提出的批评和意见，认真地进行了处理，贯彻了边整边改进的精神。
    在级别问题方面，一部分党员，感到自己的级别被评定得偏高了，就自动地向党组织提出要求，考虑降低。各校党委会经过慎重研究后，正式宣布同意一些人的要求，从7月份起降低一级。北京矿业学院有四个同志，北京俄语学院有三个同志，北京石油学院和北京外国语学院各有七个同志，降低了级别。
  关于福利补助费的问题，各校整风办公室都成立了福利检查小组，进行了调查研究。现在，各校党委会按照各校福利检查小组提出的方案，宣布领福利补助费不合理的从7月份起分期扣还。有些党员干部已经自动把福利补助费退还给公家处理。北京工业学院有一年多没有公布福利补助金开支情况，现在，决定每月公布一次福利补助金开支情况。
    在住房分配方面，许多高等学校，专门成立了研究小组，拟定改革住房分配方案，开始解决住房不合理的问题。如北京地质学院、北京矿业学院都把工棚改为临时住房，解决了一部分宿舍不足的问题。北京钢铁学院院长高芸生和副院长魏景昌、北京矿业学院副院长吴子牧等自动让出了房屋或进行了调整。
    在干部的学习条件和教学设备方面，各学校也着手改进。北京医学院对各级干部培养和提高的问题，提出了初步建议，交由各系、实习医院制定计划，最后再由院方批准实行。
    中央民族学院马列主义研究班同学要求印发中国现代革命史的讲义和资料，经领导研究后，决定除原来印发的八十万字外，另外再增印二十万字的资料和三十万字的讲义，并购买革命史挂图。北京钢铁学院冶金系教授石心圃提出，实验室氧气瓶隔离室的问题，过去一直没有解决，影响工作，现已着手改进。
    北京工业学院和北京钢铁学院过去对非党干部的工作分配和其他方面，有些不够妥善的地方，现在已着手纠正。北京钢铁学院有一个保育员，后来调到实习工厂做学徒，大家认为对她的工作分配不当，已决定调回原单位工作。
    此外，各校在一般生活上的不合理现象，也在逐步解决。
    由于广大党外群众在运动中所提出的问题，有的已经得到及时的解决，这样就逐步改善了党群关系，并更加激发了群众帮助党整风的热情。目前，各校正在继续解决大家已经提出来的问题。
