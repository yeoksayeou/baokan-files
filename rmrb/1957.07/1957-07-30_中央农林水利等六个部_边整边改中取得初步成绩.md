Xinhua News Agency, July 29th: The Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Water Conservancy, the Ministry of Aquatic Products, and the Ministry of Food have firmly implemented the policy of simultaneous rectification and reform during the rectification campaign and the struggle against bourgeois rightists, achieving preliminary results.

Since the beginning of the rectification campaign, these six ministries have absorbed cadres from both inside and outside the Communist Party to form rectification and reform committees or various groups. They have sorted out and studied the reasonable criticisms, suggestions, and requests put forward by everyone, proposed improvement plans, and implemented them according to the principle of starting with the easy and then the difficult, from urgent to gradual.

Currently, these six ministries have resolved the problem of cramped housing and lack of housing for some cadres. Cadres at the level of director and deputy director of departments and bureaus have voluntarily vacated some of their houses for other cadres to live in. The Ministry of Aquatic Products has solved the housing problem for fifty-five households. The Ministry of Water Conservancy has also borrowed some houses from other units to solve the problem of overcrowded housing for more than twenty households. In addition to the more than twenty rooms vacated by directors and deputy directors, the Ministry of Food has also allocated new houses with an area of 300 square meters for cadres to live in. The ministry has also repaired some old tables and chairs in the cadre dormitories.

These ministries have also made improvements in welfare subsidies and transportation for staff. The Ministry of Water Conservancy has readjusted welfare subsidies, canceling inappropriate welfare subsidies for some cadres. In order to take care of the living habits of Hui people, the Ministry of Water Conservancy has also set up a halal canteen. Since adjusting the use of cars, the Ministry of Food has reduced the amount of fuel used by cars from more than 1,100 kilograms to more than 700 kilograms in two months. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Conservancy both use special cars to pick up and drop off staff who live far away.

The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food have carefully studied the issue of cadre ranks and wages. Some Party members with higher wages in the Ministry of Food have voluntarily requested to lower their wages.

These ministries have also discussed the organizational structure and work system of some units and are gradually starting to adjust them. The Ministry of Food has changed the directly subordinate Oil and Fat Company and Feed Company into bureau-level organizations, thus streamlining more than 50 people to support the food departments in various provinces. The Ministry of Water Conservancy has changed the document receiving and dispatching system from "separate receiving and dispatching" to "unified dispatching and separate receiving." Unnecessary shifts have been abolished. Most departments and bureaus of this ministry have established some practical meeting systems, and the Hydrology Bureau has changed the excessive collective office hours in the past. The Afforestation Design Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry has decided to send a deputy director and eight cadres with strong political and technical qualifications to the directly subordinate afforestation survey team to strengthen leadership. The Party branch of the Afforestation Bureau has also assigned Party members to regularly contact those who want to join the Party and provide them with specific assistance.

    中央农林水利等六个部
    边整边改中取得初步成绩
    据新华社29日讯　中央农业部、农垦部、林业部、水利部、水产部和粮食部，在整风和反击资产阶级右派运动中，坚决执行边整边改的方针，取得初步成绩。
    这六个部自整风以来，吸收共产党内外的干部成立边整边改委员会或各种小组，对大家提出的合理的批评、建议和要求进行整理研究，提出改进方案，并按先易后难、由急到缓的方针加以改进。
    目前，这六个部已经解决了部分干部住房拥挤和没有房子住的困难问题。各部司、局长等干部都自动让出一部分房子给其他干部居住。水产部已经解决了五十五户人家的住宿问题。水利部还从其他单位借到一部分房子解决了二十多户人家住房过挤的现象。粮食部除司、局长让出的二十多间房子外，还拨出面积三百平方公尺的新房给干部居住。这个部还修补了干部宿舍里的一些破旧桌椅。
    这几个部对工作人员的福利补助和交通工具方面也作了改进。水利部对福利补助费重新作了调整，取消对某些干部不适当的福利补助费。为了照顾回民的生活习惯，水利部还另设了清真灶。粮食部自调整了小汽车的使用办法以后，在两个月内，汽车的用油量由一千一百多公斤下降到七百多公斤。农业部和水利部对住宿较远的工作人员都用专车接送。
    在干部级别和工资方面，农业部和粮食部都作了仔细研究。粮食部部分工资较高的党员都自动要求降低自己的工资。
    这几个部对有些单位的组织机构和工作制度也都作了讨论，并逐渐开始调整。粮食部将直属的油脂公司和饲料公司改设为局的机构，这样精简了五十多人，去支援各省的粮食部门。水利部将公文收发制度由“分收分发”改为“统发分收”。取消了不必要的值班制。这个部绝大多数司、局都建立了一些切实可行的会议制度，水文局改变了过去过多的集体办公时间。林业部造林设计局已决定抽派一位副处长和八名政治、技术条件较强的干部到直属造林调查队，加强领导。造林局党支部并分配党员经常联系要求入党的人，对他们进行具体帮助。
