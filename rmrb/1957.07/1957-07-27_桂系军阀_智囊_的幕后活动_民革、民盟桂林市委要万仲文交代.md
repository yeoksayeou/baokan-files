Behind-the-Scenes Activities of the Gui Clique Warlord's "Think Tank"
Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee and China Democratic League Guilin City Committees Demand Explanation from Wan Zhongwen

(Our dispatch) The Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (KMT RC) and the China Democratic League (CDL) Guilin City Committees have successively held symposiums in recent days to expose and criticize the anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of Wan Zhongwen, Chairman of the KMT RC Guilin City Committee, CDL member, and Director of General Affairs of Guangxi Normal College.

Before liberation, Wan Zhongwen was one of the "Six Gentlemen" in the think tank of the Gui clique warlords Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, devising plans for them for decades. After liberation, Wan Zhongwen frequently stirred up trouble and sowed discord within the KMT RC organization. At the propaganda conference convened by the CPC Guangxi Provincial Committee, Wan Zhongwen rarely expressed his opinions on the surface, but secretly wrote letters asking the full-time cadres of the KMT RC Guilin City Committee to compile materials on the cooperation between party members and non-party members in grassroots organizations, preparing to take them to the KMT RC Provincial Committee in Beijing to shoot arrows (attack).

After the Provincial Committee Propaganda Conference, Wan Zhongwen told the full-time cadres of the KMT RC Guilin City Committee that in the future, when convening forums for people from all walks of life, do not just talk about the history, nature, and tasks of the KMT RC, but talk more about the issue of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend." At a recent conference of the KMT RC Guilin City Committee, Wan Zhongwen shouted wildly: In the past, everyone said the Communist Party was good, but now we must reverse this and only say the Communist Party is bad. He also said: In the past, I did not represent the interests of the members, and I was too timid, but now I want to represent the interests of the members. How did Wan Zhongwen "represent the interests of the members"? At the height of the *Wenhui Bao's* promotion of the bourgeois orientation, he repeatedly praised the *Wenhui Bao*, saying how good it was. He also advocated handing over personnel, financial, and teaching work in schools to the college committee, in effect, restricting the leadership of the school's CPC Committee to social activities and political and ideological education. Wan Zhongwen also extremely viciously and publicly proposed "six criteria for the Communist Party's distrust of intellectuals." He also often told people that the Communist Party treated non-party members with a microscope and Communist Party members with a magnifying glass. He wanted to use this to sow discord between the Party and the masses.

At various symposiums, everyone unanimously stated that Wan Zhongwen must honestly examine and confess his anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds.

### 桂系军阀“智囊”的幕后活动  民革、民盟桂林市委要万仲文交代

    桂系军阀“智囊”的幕后活动
    民革、民盟桂林市委要万仲文交代
    本报讯　连日来，民革、民盟桂林市委先后召开座谈会，揭发和批判民革桂林市主委、民盟盟员、广西师范学院总务长万仲文的反共、反社会主义言行。
    万仲文在解放前是桂系军阀李宗仁、白崇禧的智囊团中“六君子”之一，替他们设谋筹划数十年。解放以后，万仲文在民革组织中经常兴风作浪，挑拨离间。在中共广西省委召开的宣传会议上，万仲文表面上很少发表意见，但暗地里却写信要民革桂林市委的专职干部给他整理基层组织党与非党合作共事的材料，准备给民革省委带到北京放箭。
    省委宣传会议后，万仲文对民革桂林市委的专职干部说，今后凡是召集社会人士开座谈会时，不要尽谈民革的历史、性质、任务，要多谈放鸣问题。在最近一次民革桂林市委的大会上，万仲文竟猖狂叫喊道：过去都说共产党好，现在我们要扭转过来，只说共产党的不好。他又说：过去我没有代表成员利益，缩手缩脚，现在我要代表成员利益了。万仲文是怎样“代表成员利益”的呢？正当文汇报宣扬资产阶级方向最厉害的时候，他一再推崇文汇报，说它如何好。他还主张把学校中的人事、财务、教学工作，交给院委会来办，实际上，就是要学校的中共党委的领导局限在社会活动和政治思想教育方面。万仲文还曾极其恶毒地公开提出“共产党对知识分子不信任的六条标准”。他还经常对人说共产党对待党外人士是用显微镜来看的，对共产党员则用放大镜来看。他想借此挑拨党群关系。
    在各个座谈会上，大家一致表示，万仲文必须老老实实地检查和交代反共反社会主义言行。
