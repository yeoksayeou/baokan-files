Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 30th - "Provided the labor force on the construction site is properly arranged, and the construction procedures are rationally organized, the production efficiency of the thousands of construction machines scattered across the Baotou Steel construction site can exceed the current national quota by one to two times." This is the conclusion reached by Su Hanyun, chief mechanical engineer of the Baotou Metallurgical Construction Corporation and a Communist Party member, after conducting an investigation into the use of construction machinery at the Baotou Steel construction site.

Not long ago, Su Hanyun submitted an analysis report, personally documenting the usage of construction machinery on the construction site, to the leaders of the Baotou Metallurgical Construction Corporation. The report, with concrete and credible on-site records, demonstrated that, due to the insufficiently rational organization of construction procedures on some sites, cranes that could have installed forty columns per day were only installing three. Su Hanyun said that he had recorded the work situation of a five-ton crane for half a day. Because the site management where this crane was working was relatively good and the construction procedures were arranged reasonably, the mechanical efficiency was fully utilized. This crane installed a total of 114 roof panels in 230 minutes. In terms of lifting tonnage, the crane's installation efficiency was several times higher than the national quota.

This old Communist Party member, who once served as an anti-Japanese guerrilla, transferred to the construction machinery management department during the period of the nation's First Five-Year Plan, with a cultural level of less than junior high school. In order to contribute his share to the country's industrialization, like millions of other Communist Party members, he launched an attack on the bastion of science and technology. Now, he can not only point out the performance, characteristics, and structural principles of the more than 1,200 construction machines on the construction site, but also discuss specific issues with professional technicians. Furthermore, he can propose topics on how to maximize the effectiveness of construction machinery based on the construction situation at various stages, and mobilize workers and technicians to conduct discussions.

    向科学技术的堡垒进攻
    苏汗云由外行变内行
    新华社包头30日电　“只要工地上的劳动力安排的得当，施工程序组织的合理，散布在包钢工地上的上千台施工机械，生产效率就可超过国家现行定额一倍到两倍”。这是包头冶金建筑总公司总机械师、共产党员苏汗云，对包钢工地的施工机械使用情况进行调查研究以后得出的结论。
    不久以前，苏汗云把一份亲自到工地调查纪录施工机械使用情况的分析报告，送给了包头冶金建筑总公司的领导同志。报告中以确凿可信的现场纪录说明，由于工地上施工程序组织的不够合理，有的工地上本来可以一天装吊四十根立柱的吊车，现在一天只能装吊三根。苏汗云说，他曾纪录了一台五吨吊车半天内的工作情况。由于这台吊车工作的现场管理得比较好，施工程序安排的比较合理，机械效能得到了充分发挥。这台吊车在二百三十分钟内，共装吊了屋面板一百一十四块，按起重吨数说，这台吊车的装吊效率比国家定额提高了好几倍。
    这个曾经当过抗日游击队队员的老共产党员，在国家第一个五年计划期间转业到施工机械管理部门时，文化水平还不到初中程度。他为了给祖国的工业化多贡献自己的一份力量，和千百万共产党员一样，向科学技术堡垒展开了进攻。现在，他不但可以指出工地上一千二百多台施工机械的性能、特点、结构原理，还能和专业的技术人员具体地讨论问题，并且可以根据各个时期的施工情况，提出如何发挥施工机械效能的课题，发动工人和技术人员进行讨论。
