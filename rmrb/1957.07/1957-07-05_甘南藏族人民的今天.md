Huang Zhengqing's speech pointed out: We have heard enough of the sweet talk of right-wing elements long before liberation. Only the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of all ethnic groups.

I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I will share some personal feelings.

Over the past eight years, our country has achieved a series of great accomplishments in all aspects. People of all ethnic groups are happily working and living in the united and friendly big family of the motherland, contributing their strength to the construction of socialism. When drinking water, we must remember the source. We must never forget the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. We Tibetan people have an even deeper understanding of this.

Take our Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture as an example. In the years of reactionary rule, we Tibetan people suffered heavy oppression. The reactionaries cruelly exploited and oppressed us, using various pretexts to demand money and property, cattle and sheep from us. They tried their best to sow discord among us, create disputes, and sacrifice our lives and property to satisfy their own greed. The reactionaries completely disregarded our customs and religious beliefs, and even sent troops to destroy our Labrang Monastery. They wanted us to remain in poverty and backwardness for a long time, living a subhuman life like slaves. If it were not for the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao leading the people of the whole country to defeat the reactionaries and liberate us, we Gannan Tibetan people would not know what tragic ending we would have faced.

From the day of liberation, we Gannan Tibetan people, like the people of all fraternal ethnic groups, began to live a new life full of hope and light under the brilliant light of the ethnic policies of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. In the past nearly eight years, the face of our Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has undergone tremendous changes. People of all ethnic groups have established a new relationship of friendship and cooperation on the basis of equality and unity. The unity within our Tibetan community is also strengthening day by day. The historical disputes are gradually being resolved fairly and reasonably. For example, the grassland dispute between the Gan'jia tribe of Xiahe County and the Jiawu tribe of Tongren County in Qinghai Province lasted for thirty-five years, resulting in the deaths of more than eighty people and the loss of more than 10,000 cattle and sheep. After liberation, through the patient mediation of the Party and the government, it has been properly resolved. Imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique repeatedly attempted to carry out counter-revolutionary activities in Gannan, but these conspiracies were defeated. In particular, the major victory in 1953 when the people of all ethnic groups in Gannan assisted the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the counter-revolutionary armed bandit Ma Liang was even more significant. Now, the social order in the Gannan area is unprecedentedly stable, and people of all ethnic groups live and work in peace and contentment, which was completely unimaginable before liberation.

As early as 1953, we in Gannan implemented ethnic regional autonomy and exercised the right of the people of our own ethnicity to be masters of our own affairs. Rapid development has been achieved in political, economic, and cultural undertakings. Development has been even faster, especially in 1956. Now, 113 primary cooperatives and 147 advanced cooperatives have been established in the agricultural areas of the prefecture, including 90 joint ethnic cooperatives and 36 single-ethnic cooperatives, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives reaching 54% of the total number of peasant households. In the semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, more than 1,200 agricultural and pastoral mutual aid teams and 170 pastoral mutual aid teams have been established. Livestock and agricultural production have increased year by year. In 1956, the number of livestock in the prefecture increased by more than 67,000 head, and grain production increased by more than 40 million jin. Before liberation, there was no industry in Gannan at all. Now a modern dairy factory has been built. Before liberation, Gannan had no access to automobiles or telephones. Now, automobiles are accessible to every county and telephones are accessible to every township. Before liberation, people could not get medical treatment when they were sick, and children had no opportunity to go to school. Now, medical institutions have been established in all counties, and there are mobile medical teams in pastoral areas. Poor people can enjoy free medical treatment. There are now two junior high schools and two junior normal schools in the prefecture, with 850 students. There are 194 primary schools with more than 16,000 students, and tent schools have begun to be piloted in pastoral areas. Great achievements have also been made in training ethnic minority cadres. Now the number of ethnic minority cadres in the prefecture has accounted for 37% of the total number of cadres. Many ethnic minority cadres are undertaking leadership positions at all levels. People from ethnic and religious upper classes are working in government agencies and political consultative bodies. The vast majority of Han cadres working in our autonomous prefecture are good. They are closely united with ethnic minority cadres, learn from each other, help each other, and do their work together. All the achievements of our autonomous prefecture are inseparable from the efforts of Han cadres.

Thanks to the various measures taken by the Party and the state to help us develop production and carry out construction, the lives of the people of all ethnic groups in Gannan have been greatly improved. Before liberation, every 100 jin of wool could only be exchanged for three bricks of tea or two bags of flour, but now it can be exchanged for 25 bricks of tea or six bags of flour. The 15 Tibetan and Han households in the ? (Sha) Da Village of Zhuoni County suffered greatly from food and clothing shortages before liberation. Now they are well-fed and well-clothed. In 1956, they increased grain production by more than 21,000 jin and sideline income by more than 1,600 yuan, and sold more than 3,500 jin of surplus grain to the state. Pu Hua, a herdsman of the Gan'jia tribe in Xiahe County, had only two cattle before liberation, but now he has six cattle and eighty sheep. There are endless examples like this.

Our work has also had shortcomings and mistakes. Some of these shortcomings and mistakes were caused by lack of experience, and some were caused by historical reasons. For example, remnants of Han chauvinism and local nationalism are one example. For these shortcomings and mistakes, whether Han cadres or ethnic minority cadres, Party member cadres or non-Party cadres, have a responsibility to correct them and learn lessons from them. In fact, most of the past shortcomings and mistakes have been corrected, and some are being improved. We say that achievements are the main thing and shortcomings and mistakes are individual cases. This is a fair statement based on facts and the heartfelt words of the broad masses of the people.

However, recently, some right-wing elements have taken advantage of the Party's rectification campaign, using helping the Party to rectify its style as a guise to spread reactionary remarks against the leadership of the Party, against the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, and against socialism. They have written off the great achievements made by the Party in leading the people of the whole country over the past eight years, deliberately exaggerating shortcomings, and even fabricating things out of thin air, describing the current situation of our motherland as a complete mess, worse than the period of reactionary rule. The right-wing elements' reversal of black and white, fabrication of rumors, and slander are nothing more than an attempt to drag our country from the socialist road to the capitalist road. Such reactionary words and deeds of the right-wing elements completely forget the fundamentals, betray their conscience, and completely violate the interests of the state and the people.

We Gannan Tibetan people have always been simple and straightforward, and our love and hate have always been clear. We hate the reactionaries because the reactionaries made us suffer so much. We love the Communist Party because the Communist Party has brought us happiness and light. No matter how eloquent the right-wing elements are, they will never be able to deceive us. We have heard enough of such eloquent words long before liberation. The facts of the past eight years tell us that only the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of all our ethnic groups. Forever following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and taking the socialist road means eternal happiness. This is our unwavering belief. We must, together with the people of all fraternal ethnic groups, defeat the rampant attacks of the right-wing elements, safeguard the leadership of the Party, safeguard the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, safeguard the socialist cause, and safeguard our big family of friendship and unity among all ethnic groups.

    甘南藏族人民的今天
    黄正清的发言指出：右派分子的花言巧语，早在解放前就已经听够了。只有共产党和毛主席，才是各族人民的救星。
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李先念、薄一波副总理、张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长和彭真副委员长的报告。现在，我讲一点个人的感想。
    八年来，我们国家在各个方面获得了一系列伟大的成就，各民族人民在团结友爱的祖国大家庭里愉快地劳动和生活，为建设社会主义贡献出自己的力量。饮水思源，我们决不能忘记中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导。这一点，我们藏族人民是体会得更加深刻的。
    拿我们甘南藏族自治州来说，在反动统治的年代里，我们藏族人民遭受着重重的压迫。反动派对我们进行残酷的剥削和压榨，利用种种借口向我们要钱财、要牛羊，竭力在我们中间挑拨离间，制造纠纷，牺牲我们的生命财产来满足他们自己的贪欲。反动派完全蔑视我们的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，甚至派军队破坏过我们的拉卜楞大寺。他们想叫我们长期处在贫困落后的境地，长期过着奴隶般的非人生活。如果不是中国共产党和毛主席领导全国人民打垮了反动派，把我们解放出来，我们甘南藏族人民真不知道要得到怎样悲惨的结局。
    从解放的那一天起，我们甘南藏族人民，同各兄弟民族人民一样，在中国共产党和毛主席的民族政策的光辉照耀下，开始过着充满希望和光明的新生活。在将近八年的期间，我们甘南藏族自治州的面貌已经发生了巨大的变化。各民族人民在平等团结的基础上建立了友爱合作的新关系。我们藏族内部的团结也一天比一天加强。历史上遗留下来的纠纷，逐步地得到公平合理的解决。像夏河县甘甲部落同青海省同仁县加吾部落的草山纠纷，历时三十五年，双方死了八十多人，损失牛羊一万多头，解放后经过党和政府的耐心调解，已经妥善解决。帝国主义和蒋介石集团曾经一再企图在甘南进行反革命活动，但是这些阴谋都遭到了失败。特别是一九五三年甘南各民族人民协助人民解放军剿灭反革命武装马良股匪，更是重大的胜利。现在，甘南地区的社会秩序空前安定，各民族人民安居乐业，这在解放前是完全不可想像的。
    早在一九五三年，我们甘南就实行了民族区域自治，行使了本民族当家作主的权利。在政治、经济和文化事业方面都得到迅速的发展。尤其在一九五六年发展更快。现在全州的农业区已经建立一百一十三个初级社和一百四十七个高级社，其中有九十个民族联合社和三十六个单一民族社，入社农户达到农户总数的百分之五十四。在半农半牧区，建立了一千二百多个农牧业互助组和一百七十个牧业互助组。畜牧业和农业生产历年都有增加。一九五六年全州牲畜增加了六万七千多头，粮食增产四千多万斤。解放前，甘南根本没有工业，现在已经建成一座现代化的乳品厂。解放前，甘南根本不通汽车，不通电话，现在已经是县县通汽车，乡乡通电话。解放前，人民有病得不到医疗，儿童没有机会上学，现在各县都设立了医疗机构，牧区还有巡回医疗队，贫苦人民可以享受免费治疗的待遇；全州现有初中两所，初师两所，学生八百五十人，小学一百九十四所，学生一万六千多人，并且在牧区开始试办帐篷小学，在培养少数民族干部方面也有很大成绩，现在全州少数民族干部人数已经占干部总数的百分之三十七。许多少数民族干部都担负着各级领导职务。民族宗教上层人士都在政府机关和政治协商机关工作。在我们自治州工作的汉族干部，绝大多数都是好的，他们同少数民族干部亲密团结，互相学习，互相帮助，共同做好工作。我们自治州的一切成就，是同汉族干部的努力分不开的。
    由于党和国家采取各种措施帮助我们发展生产，进行建设，甘南各民族人民的生活有了很大的改善。解放前，每百斤羊毛只能换三块砖茶或者两袋面粉，现在能换二十五块砖茶或者六袋面粉。卓尼县?（沙）大村的十五户藏民和汉民，解放前少吃缺穿，生活极苦，现在已经丰衣足食，一九五六年增产粮食二万一千多斤，副业收入一千六百多元，给国家卖余粮三千五百多斤。夏河县甘甲部落牧民普化，解放前只有两头牛，现在已经有六头牛，八十只羊。像这样的事例是说也说不完的。
    我们的工作也发生过缺点和错误。这些缺点和错误，有的是由于经验不足造成的，有的是由于历史原因造成的，譬如大汉族主义和地方民族主义思想残余就是一个例子。对于这些缺点和错误，不论汉族干部或者少数民族干部，党员干部或者非党干部，都有责任加以改正，并且从中取得教训。事实上，以往的缺点和错误，绝大部分已经得到改正，有的也正在改进中。我们说，成绩是主要的，缺点和错误是个别的，这是有事实根据的公道话，也是广大人民的心里话。
    但是，最近以来，有些右派分子乘着党进行整风的机会，把帮助党整风作为幌子，散布反对党的领导、反对工人阶级领导的人民民主专政、反对社会主义的反动言论，把党领导全国人民八年来取得的伟大成绩一笔抹煞，故意夸大缺点，甚至无中生有，把我们祖国的现状说得一团漆黑，说得比反动统治时期还不如。右派分子这样的颠倒黑白、造谣诬蔑，无非是企图把我国从社会主义的道路拖到资本主义的道路上去。右派分子这种反动言行，完全是忘了根本，昧了良心，完全是违背国家人民利益的。
    我们甘南藏族人民，向来是纯朴耿直的，我们的爱憎向来是分明的。我们恨反动派，因为反动派给我们吃尽了苦头。我们爱共产党，因为共产党给我们带来了幸福和光明。不管右派分子怎样花言巧语，永远欺骗不了我们。这样的花言巧语，我们早在解放前就已经听够了。八年来的事实告诉我们：只有共产党和毛主席，才是我们各民族人民的救星。永远跟着共产党和毛主席，走社会主义的道路，就永远是幸福。这是我们坚定不移的信念。我们一定要同各兄弟民族人民一道，击败右派分子的猖狂进攻，维护党的领导，维护工人阶级领导的人民民主专政，维护社会主义事业，维护我们各民族友爱团结的大家庭。
