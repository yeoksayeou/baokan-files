For Peace and Friendship
By our correspondents Li He and Cheng Guangrui

July 28th in Moscow was an extraordinary day, a day to remember. On this day, over thirty thousand young men and women from one hundred and twenty-two countries gathered in this city to hold a peace and friendship demonstration that shook the world.

No one will ever forget the scene of two million Muscovites lining the streets to welcome the youth representatives from various countries. Although the 28th was a Sunday, the people of Moscow got up very early and gathered along the streets where the representatives were to pass. The families living on Happiness Street opened all their doors and windows to welcome this youth contingent. This avenue became a long river of peace and friendship. Look, old women are bowing to you, women are blowing kisses to you, young people are holding your hands, and mothers are holding their children up for you to kiss. Everyone is waving to you from all the windows. All eyes are filled with joy. Everyone is shouting "Peace—Friendship." They use simple words to convey their deep friendship to the people of all countries. They shout "Port Said! Port Said!" to the heroic Egyptian youth. They shout "Moscow—Beijing!" "Mao Zedong!" to the Chinese brothers.

The welcome of the Muscovites to the Chinese brothers was so moving! At four-thirty in the morning, sixty-year-old Tatyana Yosifovna picked a bunch of bright red dahlias and spontaneously inserted them on the flagpole of the Chinese youth delegation. She wrote her heartfelt words on a note and attached it to the bouquet: "May your life and work be as beautiful as this bouquet of flowers." The driver Voroga, who drove the motorcycle for the Chinese delegation, said: "Being able to drive for the Chinese comrades is the greatest happiness of my life." At the entrance of Ostankino Park, an old man with white hair rushed towards the special car of the Chinese youth delegation, constantly shouting, "Salute to the Chinese brothers!" By the Moscow River, a disabled person used one hand to hold his other half-arm and shouted, "Moscow—Beijing, forever friendly!"

Friendship is the common language of young people from all countries. Before the opening of the conference, as the youth representatives were preparing to set off in front of the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, people saw British youth meeting Egyptian youth, French youth talking with Algerian youth, and American youth coming to greet the Chinese youth. Peace is the common thought of young people from all countries. In the parade, Japanese youth held up banners saying "Conclude an agreement to ban atomic weapons." French youth shouted "No more war!" When the parade reached Uprising Square, Condell Russell, a British youth representative and staff member of the British Association of Scientific Workers, pointed to a broken wall in the square behind the statue of the mother, depicting cities of various countries devastated by war, and said, "Look, Coventry is also on it, we must not let war happen again!"

The enthusiasm of the Muscovites lining the streets to welcome the youth delegations extended the time for the youth from various countries to have a get-together on the streets. The opening ceremony at the Central Stadium was extended and started at three o'clock in the afternoon. The opening ceremony and gymnastic dance performances lasted from three o'clock to nine o'clock. Hundreds of thousands of people were intoxicated with the joy of youth. This was the longest and grandest gathering in Moscow in many years. There cannot be two springs in a year, but people felt that a spring nurtured by the enthusiasm, friendship, and will for peace of the youth from all countries had appeared in Moscow. At three o'clock, when the ceremony of youth delegations from various countries parading around the field began, a group of girls carried a huge plum-shaped festival emblem into the stadium. The words "Peace—Friendship" surrounding the heart of the flower glittered in the sunlight. At this moment, the whole stadium burst into cheers. At more than nine o'clock in the evening, as the meeting was about to end, an airship rose up, hanging a huge festival emblem in the air above the venue. The yellow, blue, green, orange, and red petals of the flower, symbolizing the five continents, emitted a different kind of brilliance under the searchlights. The youth representatives from the five continents all looked up, how close their hearts were at this moment!

Flowers, flowers, flowers everywhere. Young people exchanged bouquets, and representatives waved bouquets. Soviet youth athletes performed various beautiful flowers with their fit bodies on a large green felt that resembled a meadow. Flowers, bouquets, garlands, and the Central Stadium itself was a large flower full of youth. In the square, the youth delegations and youth athletes from various countries were the flower hearts, and the audience wearing colorful costumes in the surrounding stands were the petals. Here, the youthful blood in people's bodies will boil.

The procession of youth delegations from various countries parading around the field was arranged in the order of the Russian alphabet. The first was Australia, the last was Japan, and finally the host, the Soviet Union. Regardless of large or small countries, large or small teams, guests or hosts, or any skin color or ethnicity, they congratulated and encouraged each other. There were so many delegations alone; how could the youth of the world not feel their strength? Zanzibar in Africa, Nicaragua in the Americas, and San Marino in Europe only had one or two representatives, but they were respected as equally as the delegations from Britain, France, Italy, and the United States. From the parade, it could be seen that there were many youth from European countries, and there were also many youth from distant places. People welcomed the representatives of Egypt and various Arab countries who were fighting for the independence of the people. The delegations from Jordan and Syria held up banners written in Arabic and Russian that read "Long Live Arab-Soviet Friendship!" The appearance of the Soviet and Chinese delegations caused the most enthusiastic applause and cheers in the venue. The colorful balloons of the Chinese delegation released the slogan "For Peace and Friendship." People watched these common languages written in Chinese go to the calm sky, emitting knowing smiles.

Peace and friendship! This is the purpose of holding the festival, and this is the direction of the efforts of the youth of the world. Representatives from the five continents were talking about this, Voroshilov was also talking about this, and the youth present will never forget Voroshilov's touching words: "Cherish peace." He said, unite the strength of your youth to defend peace, strengthen the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of all countries, and fight for a better future for all mankind! When thousands of young athletes performed striking out the atomic bomb, drawing peace doves, and writing peace characters in Russian, Chinese, Arabic, English, French, German, and Spanish, thousands of small flags on the east grandstand immediately lined up the words "For Peace and Friendship". Peace and friendship! This is the common voice of the entire venue, the entire Moscow, and the youth of the world.

    为了和平和友谊
    本报记者　李何　程光锐
    7月28日在莫斯科，这是一个不平常的日子，这是令人难忘的一天。这一天一百二十二个国家三万多青年男女们会聚在这个城市里举行了震撼世界的和平和友谊大示威。
    谁也忘记不了两百万莫斯科人夹道欢迎各国青年代表的情景。28日虽然是星期日，可是莫斯科人很早就起来了，他们陆续向代表们要经过的街道两旁汇集。住在幸福街上的人家打开了所有的门窗来欢迎这支青年队伍。这条大街变成了一条和平和友谊长河。你看，老太太们向你拱手，妇女们向你飞吻，青年们拉着你的手不放，母亲们把孩子们抱过来要你亲亲。所有的窗口里都有人向你挥手致意。所有的眼睛里都流露着欢乐的神采。所有的人都向你高呼“和平—友谊”。他们用一些简单的字传达对各国人民的深厚友情。他们向英勇的埃及青年们高呼“塞得港！塞得港！”他们向中国兄弟们高呼“莫斯科—北京！”“毛泽东！”
    莫斯科人对中国兄弟们的欢迎是那样地动人！六十岁的塔吉亚娜·约瑟夫在清早四点半钟就采来一束鲜红的大丽花自动地插在中国青年代表团旗竿上。她把心里话写在一张纸条上附在花束里：“愿你们的生活和劳动像这束鲜花一样美丽”。为中国代表团驾驶摩托车的驾驶员沃罗加说：“我能为中国同志们开车，是我一生中最大的幸福。”在奥斯丹金公园门口，一位白发苍苍的老头向中国青年代表团的专车奔来，不断喊着“向中国兄弟们致敬！”在莫斯科河边一位残废人用一只手握着他另一只半只胳膊高呼“莫斯科—北京，永远友好！”
    友谊是各国青年的共同言语。大会开幕前，青年代表们在全苏工农业展览会门前整装待发的时刻，人们看到英国青年会见了埃及青年，法国青年和阿尔及利亚青年在一起谈话，美国青年到中国青年这边来致意。和平是各国青年的共同思想。游行队伍中日本青年高举着“缔结禁止原子武器协定”的标语。法国的青年高呼“不准再有战争！”在游行队伍走到起义广场的时候，英国青年代表、英国科学工作者工会工作人员康达尔·鲁塞尔指着广场上母亲塑像后画着惨遭战祸的各国城市的一堵断墙说：“请看，那上面也有我们的考文垂，我们不能让战争重演！”
    莫斯科人夹道欢迎的热情，使各国青年队伍在街上联欢的时间延长了。中央运动场的开幕式延长到下午三点开始。开幕式和体操舞蹈表演从三点钟一直玩到九点钟。十几万人陶醉在青春的欢乐里，这是莫斯科许多年来最长最盛大的集会。一年不能有两个春天，但是人们觉得由各国青年的热情、友谊和和平的意志所孕育的春天在莫斯科出现了。三点钟各国青年代表队绕场一周仪式开始时，一群少女抬着巨大的梅花形联欢节徽章进场，这个花心上围着“和平—友谊”的字样在阳光下闪耀着，这时全场掀起了一片欢呼，晚上九点多钟，在会快要结束时，一只飞艇升起来，把一个巨大的联欢节徽章吊在会场上空。这个花朵上象征着五大洲的黄、蓝、绿、橙、红的花瓣在探照灯光下发出异样的光采。五大洲的青年代表们都在仰首观看，他们的心在这个时刻多么相近啊！
    花朵，花朵，到处是花朵。青年们互献花束，代表们挥动着花束。苏联青年男女运动员，在好像草地一样的大绿毡上用健美的身姿表演着各种艳丽的花朵。花朵、花束、花环，而中央运动场本身就是一个青春洋溢的大花朵。在广场中各国青年代表队和青年运动员是花心，周围看台上穿着各色服装的观众是花瓣。在这里，人们身上的青春的血液都会沸腾起来。
    各国青年代表队绕场一周的队伍，是按照俄文字母的次序排列的，头一个是澳大利亚，末一个是日本，最后是主人苏联。无论大国和小国，无论大队和小队，无论客人和主人，无论是那一种肤色，那一个民族，都互相贺采，互相鼓舞。仅仅代表队就有这样多；世界青年们怎么不能感到自己力量的强大呢。非洲的桑给巴、美洲的尼加拉瓜、欧洲的圣马力诺只有一两位代表，但是他们像英国、法国、意大利、美国的代表队一样平等地受到尊敬。从绕场的行列可以看到欧洲各国青年来的多，远方青年来的也不少，人们欢迎为人民独立斗争的埃及和阿拉伯各国青年的代表，约旦和叙利亚的代表队举着用阿拉伯文和俄文写的“阿拉伯和苏联友好万岁！”苏联和中国两个代表队的出现，在会场里引起了最热烈的掌声和喝采，中国代表队的五采轻气球把“为了和平与友谊”的标语放出去。人们目送这些用中文写的共同语言到平静的天空，发出会心的微笑。
    和平与友谊！这就是联欢节举行的目的，这就是世界青年努力的方向。五大洲代表说的是这件事，伏罗希洛夫说的也是这件事，在场的青年们将永远不会忘记伏罗希洛夫所赠的感人的一句话：“要珍爱和平。”他说，把自己青春的力量团结起来保卫和平，加强各国人民之间的友谊和互相了解吧，为全人类更好的未来斗争吧！当几千青年运动员表演对原子弹打叉、画出和平鸽和写出俄文、中文、阿拉伯文、英文、法文、德文、西班牙文的和平字样的时候，东看台上的几千面小旗立刻排出了“为了和平和友谊”的字句。和平与友谊！这是全会场、全莫斯科、全世界青年的共同声音。
