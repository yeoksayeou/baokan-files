    Oman Uprising Troubles Britain; British Ambassador to the US Complains America is Undermining Them
    (Dispatch from our London correspondent, July 22nd) The Omani tribal people's armed uprising has caused serious anxiety within the British government. British troops are actively deploying along the Persian Gulf coast, preparing to suppress the rebellious people.
    British Foreign Secretary Lloyd declared in the House of Commons on July 22nd that Britain had agreed to "aid" the Sultan of Oman (Muscat); local British authorities have been ordered to have "freedom to take military action within certain limits." He also said that British troops have taken small-scale "precautionary actions," because "the rebels are clearly receiving assistance from outside, so it is very proper for us to assist the Sultan (of Muscat)."
    According to British newspapers, Royal Air Force transport planes flew to the Kenya base on the evening of the 22nd, ready to transport some of the British troops there to Oman.
    Reports from Washington say that the British Ambassador to the US, Caccia, made it clear to Dulles at a secret meeting on the 19th that Britain is determined to crush any conspiracy that attempts to deprive it of its traditional interests in the oil-rich Persian Gulf. According to London's "Daily Express," the British Ambassador also accused the United States of supporting the rebels with dollars and weapons through Saudi Arabia.
    Beginning on July 22nd, British newspapers have expressed their determination to so-called "defend Middle East interests." An editorial in the "Daily Mail" stated: "Now there is only one path for Britain, and that is to quickly and decisively defend its vast and important interests with decisive action. This may be our last chance in the Middle East. If we give up this opportunity, we will have nothing left."

    阿曼起义闹得英国手忙脚乱
    英驻美大使怨美国挖墙脚
    本报伦敦22日电　阿曼部落人民武装起义引起了英国政府的严重焦虑。英国军队已在波斯湾沿岸积极进行部署，准备镇压起义人民。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德7月22日在下院宣称：英国已同意“援助”阿曼（马斯喀特）苏丹；当地的英国当局，已受命有“在某种限度内采取军事行动的自由”。他并说：英国军队已采取小规模的“警戒行动”，因为“叛乱分子显然从外界得到援助，所以我们援助（马斯喀特）苏丹是非常应该的。”
    据英国报纸报道：英国皇家空军的运输机并已于22日晚飞到怯尼亚基地，准备把该处的部分英军，运往阿曼。
    来自华盛顿的报道说，英国驻美大使卡西亚在19日的一次秘密会议上，向杜勒斯明确表示：英国决心粉碎一切企图剥夺它在盛产石油的波斯湾的传统利益的阴谋。另据伦敦“每日快报”报道，英国大使并指责美国通过沙特阿拉伯，以美元和武器支持叛军。
    从7月22日开始，英国报纸纷纷表示了所谓“保卫中东利益”的决心。“每日邮报”的社论说：“现在对英国来说只有一条道路，这就是迅速地坚决地以决定性的行动来保卫它的广大的重要利益，这可能是我们在中东的最后一次机会。如果放弃了这个机会，我们就再也不会留下什么东西了。”
