The Glorious Thirty Years

This year, August 1st, is the 30th anniversary of the founding of the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army. Under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has experienced a difficult struggle, growing stronger in battle, and becoming a people's army with high political consciousness, modern military equipment, rich combat experience, and cultural literacy.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, flesh and blood connected to the people, wholeheartedly fighting for the motherland and the people. It has lofty ideals and a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. Every soldier understands for whom he is serving, why he is fighting, and knows the present and future of the Chinese revolution. It has complete strategies, tactics, and rich combat experience. It has excellent traditions formed through long-term struggle. It is precisely because it is such a new type of army that it can overcome unparalleled dangers and difficulties, growing from small to large, from weak to strong, and becoming an invincible force.

Now, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is advancing towards modernization, and it will defend our great and beloved socialist motherland with even greater strength.
