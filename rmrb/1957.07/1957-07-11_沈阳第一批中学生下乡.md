Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 9th. On the morning of the 8th, more than 1,700 middle school students in Shenyang gathered to warmly send off the first group of 85 graduating junior middle school students to the countryside to participate in agricultural production.

Among the 85 students, only three have families living in the countryside, and 82 have lived in the city for a long time. They are the children of workers, farmers, engineers, teachers, doctors, and government officials, including the daughter of Huang Da, Deputy Governor of Liaoning Province. They are all determined to go to the countryside and become the first generation of cultured farmers in the motherland.

They are graduating junior middle school students from fifteen middle schools in Shenyang. After repeated education in school, especially after visiting the countryside or interning in agricultural cooperatives, they all realized the prospects of agricultural production and knew that the countryside urgently needed educated youth, thus laying the foundation for their determination to participate in agricultural production.

Shao Kai, Deputy Mayor of Shenyang, spoke at the farewell meeting, encouraging them to work diligently, be true farmers, and become capable builders of the motherland. He also instructed them not to act as teachers or stand above the masses after arriving in the countryside, but to integrate with the peasants and humbly learn from experienced old farmers.

That afternoon, they took large carts sent by several vegetable production cooperatives in the suburbs to welcome the new members and went to various cooperatives to participate in production.

    沈阳第一批中学生下乡
    新华社沈阳9日电　8日上午，沈阳市一千七百多名中学生集会，热烈欢送第一批下乡参加农业生产的八十五名本届初中毕业生。
    在八十五名学生中，只有三个人的家住在农村，八十二个人是长期住在城市的。他们是工人、农民、工程师、教师、医生和机关干部的子女，也有辽宁省副省长黄达的女儿。他们都立志到农村去，作祖国第一代有文化的农民。
    他们是沈阳市内十五所中学的应届初中毕业生。在学校经过反复教育，特别是到农村参观或在农业社实习以后，都认识到农业生产的前途，知道了农村迫切需要知识青年，因此奠定了参加农业生产的决心。
    沈阳市副市长邵凯，在欢送会上讲话，勉励他们勤勤恳恳，作一个真正的农民，成为祖国有本领的建设者。并嘱咐他们到农村后，不要好为人师，站在群众之上，要同农民打成一片，虚心向有生产经验的老农学习。
    当天下午，他们坐着市郊几个蔬菜生产合作社派来迎接新社员的大车，分赴各合作社去参加生产。
