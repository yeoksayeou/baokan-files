    Hurrah for Activists!
    Tian Ma
    The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique once scolded activists as "mantises" and "maggots crawling upwards." How could ivory come out of a dog's mouth? Let's not bother with that. Now, when the right-wingers are attacking the Communist Party, one of the targets they wield their cudgels against is still the activists. They scold activists as "moats," as "brave volunteers building walls and digging trenches," as "barbed wire outside the wall." Some people even say that activists are "more stinky than dog屎." In the eyes of these people, activists are truly worthless and deserve to die ten thousand times. One gentleman once said, "It wouldn't hurt to kill bureaucracy with one blow." I think some people are really trying to kill activists with one blow!
    It's easy to negate everything and curse everything; just move your mouth. The problem is that such reckless talk and cursing, though satisfying, can't knock anyone down or negate anything.
    There are probably two types of people who curse activists. One type considers themselves superior and says that activists are "sucking up" when they see them close to leaders. They negate all activists when they see that some activists have shortcomings and mistakes. Some of these people hold grudges against activists because they were wrongly hurt in the "Three-Anti" and Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries movements, and they take this rectification opportunity to vent and retaliate. They don't take a "cure the sickness and save the patient" attitude to help activists correct their shortcomings, but rather obliterate everything and curse everything. I won't talk much about these people here. I believe they will receive some education through this movement.
    What is worth noting is another type of people, whose attacks and slanders against activists are with ulterior motives. Activists are the link between the Party and the masses, enjoy high prestige among the masses, and have established great achievements in revolutionary struggles and production construction. Activists are not stinky at all, but very fragrant! This is common knowledge. Those right-wing figures with ulterior motives have not failed to see this point. On the contrary, they resent it precisely because they have seen it. They want to take advantage of the Communist Party's rectification to fish in troubled waters, attempting to change the situation and make the Communist Party step down. But their hearts are willing, yet their strength is insufficient—they have no mass base. Although people like Ge Peiqi and Wang Dezhou come out to pretend to speak on behalf of the people, the result proves that they can only represent themselves and a small group of people like them, and cannot represent anyone else. Therefore, the more the socialist cause advances, the greater the Communist Party's strength and the higher its prestige, the greater these gentlemen's antipathy becomes. The closer the Communist Party's connection with the masses, the more they feel their own weakness and isolation. But they are unwilling to accept the disillusionment of hope and still want to compete with the Communist Party. The Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique once waged a "heart-digging war" against the Party, while the right-wingers have chosen the "root-digging" tactic. They want to dig up the roots of the Communist Party, cut off the Communist Party's left and right hands, and isolate the Communist Party from the masses. Therefore, they have chosen activists as the target of attack. The tactics cannot be said to be not clever, and the means cannot be said to be not vicious. But heaven does not help people, and things are not so satisfactory. It is not the Communist Party that is isolated, but themselves. Their true colors are even more exposed in front of the masses!
    Saying that activists are "moats" and "barbed wire outside the wall," I think the analogy is very good. Activists are precisely the "river" protecting socialism and the "net" protecting socialism. When these conspirators with ulterior motives rampantly attack the Party and socialism, haven't they stepped forward to give a strong counterattack?
    Activists are the pride of the people and priceless treasures. May more new activists emerge. I want to shout: Hurrah for activists!

    积极分子万岁！
    天马
    胡风反革命集团曾经骂积极分子是“螳螂”，是“向上爬的蛆虫”，狗嘴里哪能出象牙，且不去管它。现在，右派分子在向共产党进攻的时候，狼牙棒挥舞的对象之一，仍是积极分子。他们骂积极分子是“护城河”；是“筑墙挖沟的义勇队”；是“墙外的铁丝网”。有的人甚至把积极分子说成“比狗屎还臭”。在这些人看来，积极分子真是一无是处，罪该万死了。有一位先生曾说“一棍子打死官僚主义未尝不可”，我看有些人真是企图一棍子打死积极分子哩！
    否定一切，骂倒一切是容易的，动动嘴巴就行；问题是这样信口开河，臭骂一通，痛快固然痛快，可就是骂不倒，也否定不了。
    骂积极分子的大概有两种人。一种人自命清高，看见积极分子接近领导，就说是“吹牛拍马”；看见某些积极分子有缺点错误就把所有的积极分子都否定了。其中有些人是因为在“三反”、肃反运动中受到了误伤，对积极分子怀恨在心，趁这次整风的机会来发泄和报复一下，他们对积极分子不是采取“治病救人”，帮助改正缺点的态度，而是抹煞一切，骂倒一切。这种人我这里不多谈，我相信经过这次运动，他们是会多少受到一些教育的。
    值得注意的倒是另外一种人，他们之攻击和诋毁积极分子是别有用心的。积极分子是党和群众联系的纽带，在群众中享有很高的威信，在革命斗争和生产建设中都建立了伟大的功绩，积极分子不是臭得很，而是香得很！这本是众所周知的事。那些别有用心的右派人物不是没有看到这一点，相反的，他们正是看到了这一点而怀恨在心。他们想趁共产党整风的机会来混水摸鱼，企图变天，要共产党下台。可是心有余而力不足——他们没有群众基础。虽然有葛佩琦、王德周之流出来冒充代表人民说话，但结果证明，除只能代表他们自己和与他们同类的一小撮人之外，谁也代表不了。因此，社会主义的事业愈前进，共产党的力量愈大、威信愈高，这些先生们的反感也就愈大；共产党与群众的联系愈紧密，他们也就愈感到自己的势单力薄，孤掌难鸣。但是他们又不甘心于希望的幻灭，还想与共产党决一雌雄。胡风反革命集团曾经对党进行“挖心战”，而右派分子们却选用了“挖根”的战术，他们要挖共产党的根，砍断共产党的左右手，使共产党在群众中孤立起来，于是他们选中了积极分子作为攻击的目标。战术不可谓不巧妙，手段不可谓不毒辣了。奈何天不佑人，事情不那么称心如意，被孤立的不是共产党，而是他们自己，他们的本来面目在群众面前更加暴露了！
    说积极分子是“护城河”，是“墙外的铁丝网”，我看比喻得很好，积极分子正是护社会主义之“河”，护社会主义之“网”，当这些别有用心的阴谋家们猖狂地向党、向社会主义进攻的时候，他们不是已经挺身而出予以有力的反击了么？
    积极分子是人民的骄傲，是无价的财宝，愿新的积极分子更多地涌现。我要高呼：积极分子万岁！
