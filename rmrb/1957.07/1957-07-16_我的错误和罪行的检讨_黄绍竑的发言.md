My Self-Criticism of Errors and Crimes
Huang Shaohong's Speech

I now present to the conference my self-criticism of errors and crimes:

At the United Front Work Department symposium, I expressed extremely serious erroneous opinions. After the continuous criticism from various representatives and listening to the reports from Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Chief Procurator Zhang Dingcheng of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and President Dong Biwu of the Supreme People's Court, I truly realized the extremely serious nature of my erroneous opinions. Like toxins, they were spread throughout society, affecting the prestige of the Party and the government. I am extremely apprehensive and hate myself for this! My serious error stemmed from my ideological standpoint.

An ideological standpoint is formed by each person's life history. I came from a landlord family, and seven-eighths of my life was spent in the old society. Moreover, I served as a bureaucrat and warlord in the Kuomintang reactionary regime for more than twenty years, doing many things that were harmful to the people. Feudal thoughts, bourgeois thoughts, old democratic thoughts – all kinds of backward ideas were deeply rooted in my mind. After liberation, I was pardoned by the Party and the people and given opportunities for work and study. How grateful I should have been! How I should have recognized my past historical crimes! How I should have studied to transform my thinking in order to repay the Party and the people!

However, my study was not earnest. I held the idea of taking my time with ideological transformation and believed that democratic personages could not be transformed so thoroughly. I thought that retaining some old roots would allow me to muddle along behind the Party into socialist society. During my studies, I failed to truly arm my mind with Marxism-Leninism, instead picking up some Marxist-Leninist theories to cover up my remaining reactionary thoughts. These remaining reactionary thoughts were revealed unconsciously in my words and actions at any time and any place, which is to say, I was unknowingly moving towards an anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist stance.

Now, I will examine the specific facts of my errors separately:

A. Erroneous Opinions Expressed at the United Front Work Department Symposium:

1. Examination of the Erroneous Opinion on Party-Government Relations. Although I repeatedly stated that the Party-Government relations I proposed did not involve the issue of the Party's leadership, and even said that if anyone suspected the Party's leadership, it would violate the constitution, this did not represent my firm support for the Party's leadership. Instead, I wanted to use it to cover up my erroneous anti-Party opinions. I did not understand the historical process of the Party leading the people to revolutionary victory. The Party is the ideological and political leadership core of the masses. The great joint appeals and instructions issued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council are necessary not only in the past and present but also in the future. I erroneously believed that the Party was directly issuing orders to the people and the government, seeing it as an issue of Party-Government relations. The Five-Person Group was the core leading the anti-rightist movement, and direct handling was necessary in certain situations. I ask, where should cases involving production and education through labor be handled before legal regulations are in place? This is my anti-Party manifestation, and my erroneous anti-Party opinions constitute my anti-Party crime.

2. "Achievements are Primary, Deviations are Individual" Has Become a Formula. Examination of this erroneous opinion: I have not participated in the arduous struggle of the people's revolution. I am no more than an exploiter who gained without laboring in the people's revolution. Therefore, ideologically, my understanding of the great significance of the various achievements of the people's revolution is insufficient. I did not appreciate that the enormous achievements made in a short eight years were the precious fruits of the arduous struggle of workers, peasants, and cadres. Instead, I thought that doing well was the government's natural responsibility, and I did not appreciate that no government can do all good things at once. I often harbored the idea of seeking perfection, and such thinking will undoubtedly magnify shortcomings and negate achievements. In particular, my description of the shortcomings committed an unforgivable error.

I have not personally participated in the five major movements. My understanding of the basic and great achievements of the five major movements is not profound. I have always had an unclear understanding of the adoption of mass struggle forms, suspecting that mass struggle forms are the main factor causing deviations and errors. This is my ideological manifestation of being detached from the people and leaving a way out for counter-revolutionaries. I neglected that it was a great achievement in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and a great role in training the broad masses of the people to raise their awareness and pave the way for the three major transformations. I did not analyze the subjective and objective reasons, to see which of those deviations and errors could have been avoided at the time, and which could not have been completely avoided or even were unavoidable. My views and statements were indeed aimed at opposing the socialist revolution.

I usually like to talk about the legal system, believing that once the legal system is complete, all movements can be dispensed with. I do not know that movements have the function of rectifying the source. The legal system can only play its role after the movements have rectified the source. The most obvious example is that if it were not for this rectification campaign, the struggle to criticize right-wing elements, I would not be able to fundamentally recognize my errors.

B. Errors in Inspection Work and Daily Words and Actions:

1. My Error Examination in Judicial Inspection Work. Due to my skepticism about the use of mass struggle methods in the "Supress Counterrevolutionaries" movement, and due to my old social background, I sympathized with the reflections of landlords, counter-revolutionaries, and their families, so-called "wronged" cases, without analyzing their class origins. I believed that there were many deviations and shortcomings in the judicial aspect. My ideological standpoint was obviously wrong when I went to inspect judicial work with such a motivation.

During the inspection, I only paid attention to the aspect of correcting errors, and did not pay attention to the aspect of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. This is my error of insufficient understanding of the importance and continuity of the suppression of counterrevolutionaries movement, losing my position in resolutely fighting against counter-revolutionaries. Paying attention to the erroneous aspect while not emphasizing the lenient aspect is my error of insufficient understanding of the policy of combining suppression with leniency. As a result, my inspection of the judiciary was solely for the purpose of finding wrong cases. There is no doubt that my thinking and actions would exaggerate shortcomings and negate achievements. Some of the cases I found to be wrong were either overturned or retried by the court, which I thought was an achievement of my work, and I became even more energetic, encouraging counter-revolutionary elements to appeal and pester, in effect crying injustice for counter-revolutionary elements. At the CPPCC symposium, based on some letters from the people, 99% of which were from counter-revolutionaries or their families, or events seen and heard during the inspection, I reflected on them casually without analysis or research, such as reflecting on the Xie Xin issue at Normal University, and the Liu Maolin issue at the Railway Primary School, all of which were wrong. For example, I regarded some cases that had already been corrected by the court as shortcomings, instead of regarding these corrections as the advantages of the people's judiciary, which was especially wrong.

The superiority of the people's judicial system is well known, but I did not think it was easy for the judicial reform to establish various new systems in just a few years, and I was seeking perfection and nitpicking everywhere, and I did not compare it with the old judiciary. My speeches on the judiciary at the two conferences, or other criticisms, were all wrong. I did not recognize the overall advantages of the people's judiciary, and I did not recognize the great achievements of the people's judiciary in defending the people's democratic dictatorship and fighting against counter-revolutionaries. These are all errors in my ideological standpoint.

2. Examination of My Erroneous Opinions on the Establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. I raised many opinions on the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region at various meetings, and I insisted on my erroneous opinions. Some representatives questioned me: "You are a representative of the people of Guangxi, why do you only raise personal opinions and not the opinions of the people of Guangxi? The vast majority of the people of Guangxi support the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region." I accepted the criticism of this representative, and I admit that my error was that I did not speak from the standpoint of representing the people, and I am an unqualified representative. I admitted in the group meeting that I have Han chauvinist ideas, the main point of which is that I am unwilling to wear the hat of the Zhuang nationality, violating the national policy stipulated by the constitution. Some representatives asked me in return, you are a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, why did you violate the national policy stipulated by the constitution? Isn't that a deliberate violation? Indeed, I was confused by my personal Han chauvinist thoughts, and my position was wrong. This ideological standpoint is caused by my old ruling class ideas. During my time in reactionary rule in Guangxi, I ignored the ethnic minorities in Guangxi and did many things that were harmful to the fraternal nationalities. My past sins were great. After liberation, I was forgiven by the people, but I still failed to recognize my sins and repent. I am very remorseful. I also said inflammatory things, thinking that if Han people ask for separation after the establishment of the autonomous region, it should be dealt with as contradictions among the people. How reactionary is that? After this criticism and education, I recognized my historical sins and current errors, and I firmly support the plan for the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

3. My Error Examination of the Pingle Incident in Guangxi. I doubted the entire agricultural production achievements of Guangxi Province because of individual errors in the Pingle area. I exaggerated the individual errors. I spoke about it casually to people before the government's handling was announced, and I said things that damaged the prestige of the Party and the government. I made a serious error.

4. Explanation of the Lin Xiling and Xie Xin Issues and Error Examination. I did not know Lin Xiling before, nor had I heard her name. I met her at the home of Representative Tan Tiwu in early June. She lived there. I mainly saw Tan Tiwu to persuade her not to make personal attacks on Lu Yuwen's past history, and to talk about the judicial inspection situation. She introduced Lin as a student who was about to graduate from the Law Department of Renmin University, who had been to various places for judicial practice and was a young writer. Lin was also present during the conversation. Because there were many similarities in our thoughts during this conversation, I thought at the time that she was a lively young person with talent. Lin came to see me on June 9th. At that time, my erroneous opinions had not been criticized yet (the criticism began on June 13th), and I did not know my errors. I wanted to know more about the judicial situation in various places and the rectification situation in various schools. Under the guidance of such thinking, I talked to her. Now, the main points of the two conversations are divided into the following points for explanation (due to language and hearing reasons, there may be omissions in the recollection, and due to space limitations, I can only choose the main points). 1. On the judicial issue, we talked about the situations we had seen in various places. She asked if there were any case files to see. I said there was only one case file that the Supreme Court had revoked the original judgment and remanded for retrial, and the defendant's appeal letter, but she did not read it. She said that to engage in the legal system, you must have a theoretical foundation of law, and criticized me for not having a theoretical foundation and that experience alone is not enough. She asked me why I specialized in judicial inspection. I said that problems are easily seen due to the relationship of mutual constraints in all aspects. 2. On the issue of rectification in schools, she said that all universities had been ignited like a raging fire and were freely speaking out. I said that I had only seen the free speech of some teachers in the newspapers, and had not seen the free speech of students. She said that it was nothing, and that students were speaking out even more fiercely. She asked how many big-character posters had been posted and how many debates had been held. She said that the people's representatives did not go to see them, which was bureaucratic. She was very dissatisfied that the newspapers did not publish the situation of students speaking out, and that they wanted to raise funds to publish a publication. She said that someone had promised to donate money but had not given it, and that they might take it back (she did not ask me for donations). She asked if Gao and Rao were internal contradictions. I said they were contradictions between the enemy and us. She asked why they were not. I said that all those who endanger the Party and the country are contradictions between the enemy and us. 3. She talked about her political reactionary theories, which I found to be very bizarre and difficult to understand. 4. I had read her indictment and talked about its contents. I asked if the court had accepted it. She said it had been accepted but not tried, and that it might be mediated. 5. She talked about her musical talent and writing talent, her experience of writing articles at the age of ten and joining the army at the age of thirteen, and her experience at Renmin University. 6. She was dissatisfied with the status quo, believing that studying law was not very useful, and that she was determined to become a young writer and write about the dark side of society. I felt that she was a bizarre young person with considerable talent. At the time, I did not feel that she was reactionary. I advised her not to mess around and cause trouble, and advised her to go back to school to study hard and serve the judiciary, and that she could also write articles. As a result, she agreed to go back. Not long after she left, Tan Tiwu called to talk about Lin Xiling being very ostentatious and asked me to pay attention. Now I regret that I should not have talked so much to a young person whose reactionary roots were unknown. This error also occurred because my ideological standpoint was not clear.

I met Xie Xin at a dance party at the Cultural Club in 1950. I didn't know her historical background. According to her, she came back from Hong Kong and was familiar with some democratic personages. There were many people dancing, not just her. She and other companions sometimes stayed at my house. I have never talked to her about any political issues other than dancing. There were fewer and fewer interactions after 1952, and there were no interactions after 1954. She borrowed thirty yuan from me when she went to Anshan for recuperation. There was no other material assistance. It was not until 1955 that I heard that she had been arrested as a counter-revolutionary, and then I knew that she was a counter-revolutionary element. This spring, she wrote a letter saying that the People's Procuratorate had decided not to prosecute and had released her. She came to see me once and talked for more than ten minutes, mainly talking about the process of being arrested and released, and sent her appeal documents to be forwarded to the People's Reception Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I forwarded them as I would with general letters from the people. Her appeal was not only forwarded by me, but also by others. She sent another copy later, which I did not forward. I should not have interacted with people of unknown backgrounds in the past, and especially should not have received counter-revolutionary elements who were treated leniently now.

In short, my anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and actions are not accidental, they have historical roots, are consistent from beginning to end, and are being exposed more and more with the progress of socialist construction. I have accepted the well-intentioned criticism and help from various representatives and comrades very little and very late. Sometimes I even mistook good intentions for malice and had a resistant attitude, due to my stubborn reactionary thoughts. Now I confess them frankly, hoping for continued criticism and help.

C. My Past Historical Crimes and My Current Understanding:

All the representatives and comrades have exposed many of my past historical crimes. I admit most of them, and some have discrepancies with the facts. I do not want to defend myself here. I generally believe that they are all of educational significance to me. Since liberation, I have been treated generously by the Party and the people and given the opportunity to study and work. I should be grateful to the Party and the people, reflect on my sinful history, transform myself well, serve the people, and atone for my sins. But I forgot my historical sins, my thinking became blurred, and my position became unstable, resulting in many anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist words and actions, which are not only unacceptable to human feelings but also intolerable to the principles of law. If it were not for the representatives and comrades using the mirror of history to show my sinful face, I would not have known that the serious errors I am committing now come from historical roots. I am willing to always place the mirror of history in front of me as a warning to correct my mistakes and atone for my sins.

The significance of this anti-Rightist struggle is very great. Without this struggle, it would be impossible to distinguish between right and wrong, between the enemy and us, and to expose the sinful faces of the Rightist reactionary elements. I played a shameful, hateful, and heartbreaking role in this struggle. When I was first criticized, I thought I was being wronged for being loyal, but I forgot the roots of my historical sins, and I did not know that my ideological position was moving deeper and deeper in a reactionary direction. Now that I recognize my errors and crimes, I feel very painful inside. I feel that I have no face to see the people. It makes me realize that if I do not wake up, make a painful decision, and fundamentally transform my erroneous thoughts and change my erroneous position, then I will be cut off from the people.

The Party and the people are generous. In this struggle, the Party has educated the Rightist elements, saving those who have lost their nature and direction. I am one who has been saved. I am grateful to the Party and the people for their kindness in giving me a new life. I now sincerely confess my sins to the Party and the people. In the future, I am determined to thoroughly correct my errors as a manifestation of atonement. I am willing to accept the punishment I deserve.

### 我的错误和罪行的检讨  黄绍竑的发言

    我的错误和罪行的检讨
    黄绍竑的发言
    我现在向大会检讨我的错误和罪行：
    我在统战座谈会上发表了极其严重错误的意见，经各代表的不断的批判并听了周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理和最高人民检察院张鼎丞检察长、最高人民法院董必武院长的报告之后，才真正认识到我那个极其严重的错误的意见，似毒素般散布在社会上，致使党和政府的威望受到影响，我非常的惶恐、非常痛恨我自己！我的严重错误是由思想立场上发生的。
    思想立场是由每个人的生活历史形成的，我是地主家庭出身，八分之七的年光是在旧社会里生活，而且在国民党反动政权里做了二十多年的官僚军阀，做了很多对不起人民的事情，封建思想、资产阶级思想、旧民主思想种种落后思想在我的脑子里是根深蒂固的。解放后蒙党和人民的宽恕并给以工作和学习的机会，我应该如何感谢，应该如何认识以往的历史罪恶，应该如何学习改造思想，以报答党和人民。
    但是我的学习并不认真，对思想改造存着慢慢来的想法，并且以为民主人士思想总不能改造得那样彻底，残存一些旧根子也可以跟着党的后面混进社会主义社会。在学习的时候，不能真正地用马列主义武装自己的头脑，而是摭拾一些马列主义理论掩护自己残存的反动思想，那些残存反动思想随时随地不知不觉地在言论和行动中发现出来，也就是不知不觉地走向反党、反人民、反社会主义的立场。
    现在把错误的具体事实分别检查一下：
    甲、统战座谈会上所提的错误意见：
    一、党政关系错误意见的检查。我虽一再说明所提党政关系绝不涉及党的领导权问题，并且说如果有人怀疑到党的领导权问题那就与宪法违背了，这并不是表示我对党领导坚决拥护的态度，而是想借此掩护我错误的反党的意见，我没有了解到党领导人民革命胜利的历史过程，党是群众的思想政治的领导核心，党中央和国务院发出伟大的联合号召和指示，不但过去、现在和将来这种方法都是必要的，而错误地认为是党直接向人民和政府发号施令，是党政的关系问题。五人小组是领导肃反运动的核心，在某种情况之下直接处理是必要的，试问关于生产教养的处分案件在未有法律规定以前由何处处理呢？这就是我反党的表现，我错误的反党的意见，已经构成我反党的罪行。
    二、成绩是主要的偏差错误是个别的已成为公式。这个错误意见的检查，我没有参加过人民革命的艰苦斗争，不啻是一个对人民革命不劳而获的剥削者，因此，我对人民革命各种成绩的伟大意义在思想立场上认识是不够的，我没有体会到在短短八年内获得这样巨大成绩是工人、农民和干部艰苦奋斗得来的宝贵果实，而以为做好成绩是政府当然的责任，而没有体会到任何政府也不能把好事一时办完，时常存着求全责备的思想，这样的思想毫无疑问是会扩大缺点抹煞成绩的，尤其是我对缺点的形容犯了不可饶恕的错误。
    我没有亲自参加过五大运动，对于五大运动基本的伟大的成绩认识是不深刻的，我一向对采用群众性的斗争形式认识不清，怀疑群众性的斗争形式是造成偏差错误的主要因素，这就是我脱离人民立场为反革命分子留后路的思想表现。而忽视了它是巩固人民民主专政的伟大成绩，是锻炼广大人民群众提高觉悟为三大改造铺平道路的伟大作用。我没有分析主观和客观的原因，在当时那些偏差错误是可以避免的，那些是不能完全避免甚至无法避免的，我那样的看法提法的确是犯了反对社会主义革命的目的。
    我平时好谈法制，以为法制完备了，一切运动都可以不必，而不知道运动是有正本澄源的作用的，法制是在运动正本澄源之后才能发生它的作用的，最显著的例证如果不是经过这次整风运动，批评右派分子的斗争中，我是不能从根本上认识错误的。
    乙、视察工作和平时言论行动上的错误：
    一、视察司法工作中我的错误检查。由于我对“肃反”运动中用群众性斗争方式表示怀疑，由于我旧社会环境关系，地主阶级分子、反革命分子和其家属的反映，他们所谓“冤枉”我不加分析它的阶级来源，而就同情他们，认为司法方面有不少偏差和缺点。我就以这样的动机去视察司法工作，思想立场显然是错误的。
    在视察中，我仅注意有错必纠的方面，而没有注意有反必肃的方面，这是我对肃反运动的重要性和继续性认识不够的错误，丧失了对反革命进行坚决斗争的立场。注意错误的方面而不重视宽大的方面，这是我对镇压与宽大相结合的政策认识不够的错误。由于这样，我视察司法就是专门为找错案，我这样想这样做毫无疑问是会夸大缺点抹煞成绩的，找出一些我认为是错的案子其中有些经法院平反或改判了，以为是工作的成绩，而更加起劲，助长了反革命分子的申诉纠缠，无异为反革命分子喊冤。我在政协座谈会上根据一些人民来信，百分之九十九都是反革命分子或其家属的来信，或视察中所见所闻的事件，不加分析研究随便反映，如反映师大的谢昕问题，铁道小学的刘茂林问题，都是错误的。又如把某些已经法院纠正的案子作为缺点，而不把这些纠正是人民司法的优点，尤其是错误的。
    人民司法制度的优越性是人所共知的，但我对司法改革仅仅数年时间建立了种种新制度，是不容易的，而到处求全责备吹毛求疵，也没有将旧司法比对一下，我在两次会议上关于司法的发言，或其他批评都是犯了错误的，我没有认识人民司法整个的优点，我没有认识人民司法保卫人民民主专政和反革命作斗争的伟大成绩，这都是我思想立场上的错误。
    二、成立广西僮族自治区我的错误意见的检查。我对成立广西僮族自治区在各次会议上提了不少意见，并坚持我的错误意见，有的代表质问我“你身为广西人民代表为什么专提个人意见而不提广西人民的意见呢？广西人民绝大多数是拥护建立僮族自治区的。”我接受这位代表的批评，我承认我的错误，的确没有站在代表人民的立场说话，我是不称职的代表。我在小组会上承认我有大汉族主义思想，主要的观点是不愿戴僮族的帽子，违反宪法所规定的民族政策。有的代表反问我，你身为人大常委为什么违反了宪法规定的民族政策，岂不是明知故犯吗？的确我是被我个人的大汉族主义思想所迷糊了，立场错误了。我这种思想立场是由于我的旧统治阶级思想造成的，我在广西反动统治的时间无视广西少数民族，做了许多对不起兄弟民族的事，我过去的罪恶是很大的，解放后蒙人民的宽大尚不能认识罪恶痛改前非，是非常悔恨的。我还说过带有煽动性的话，认为自治区成立后如果汉族有人要求分时应按人民内部矛盾处理，是何等的反动？经过这次批评教育，我认识了历史的罪恶和现在的错误，我坚决拥护广西僮族自治区的方案。
    三、广西平乐事件我的错误检查。我把平乐专区个别的错误而怀疑了广西省整个的农业生产成绩，我把个别的错误夸大了，在政府处理尚未公布以前随便对人说，并说过上下相蒙有损党和政府威望的话，我犯了严重的错误。
    四、关于林希翎、谢昕问题的交代和错误的检查。我以前不认识林希翎，也未闻过她的名字，六月初去谭惕吾代表家里碰到的，她住在那里，我看谭惕吾主要是劝她不要对卢郁文作过去历史的私人攻击，并谈谈视察司法情况，她介绍林是人民大学法律系将要毕业的学生，到过各地司法实习，是个青年作家，谈话时林也在座，由于这次谈话彼此在思想上有不少相同的地方，当时以为她是个有天才的活泼青年，六月九日林来看我，那时我的错误意见尚未被批判（六月十三日开始被批判的），自己尚不知道错误，想多知道一些各地司法情况和各学校整风情况，在这样的思想主导下与她谈话的，现在把两次谈话的大意分为以下各点说明（因语言和听觉关系回忆可能有遗漏，又因篇幅的关系只能择要）。1．司法问题，彼此把各地所见到的情况交互谈谈，她问有什么案卷可以看，我说只一个最高法院已撤销原判发还更审的案卷和被告的申诉书，但她并没有看，她说搞法制必须有法学理论基础，并批评我没有理论基础，光凭经验是不行的，问我为什么专门视察司法？我说因各方面相互制约的关系容易看出问题。2．学校整风问题，她说各大学已如怒火一般鸣放起来了。我说只看见报上某些老师们的鸣放，没有看见学生的鸣放，她说那算不了什么，学生鸣放得更厉害，不知出了多少大字报和开了多少辩论会，她说人民代表为什么不去看看，真是官僚主义，她很不满意报纸没有把学生鸣放的情况登出来，她们要募捐出刊物，说某人答应捐款但又不给了，恐怕要收了（并没有向我募捐），她问高、饶是否内部矛盾？我说是敌我矛盾，她问为何不是？我说凡是危害党和国家的都是敌我矛盾。3．她谈她的政治的反动理论，我觉得很怪诞，有些听不懂。4．我看过她的控诉书，并谈了那些内容，我问法院受理了没有？她说已受理但未开审，可能是调解。5．谈她的音乐天才和写作天才，十岁写文章十三岁参军的经过和在人民大学的经过。6．她不满现状，认为学法律没大用处，要决心做个青年作家，把社会黑暗的一面写出来。我觉得她是一个怪诞性有相当天才的青年，当时并不觉得她是反动，我劝她不要胡闹会闹出乱子来，劝她回学校好好的考毕业为司法服务，也可以写文章，结果她同意回去了，去了不久谭惕吾来电话谈林希翎很招摇，要我注意。现在我很悔恨不该与不知有反动根底的青年谈这许多话，这个错误也是由于我思想立场上认识不清楚而发生的。
    谢昕是1950年在文化俱乐部跳舞晚会上认识的，我不知道她的历史根底，据她说是从香港回来的，与某些民主人士都熟，跳舞的人很多，也不仅是她一个，时常变动的。她和其他同伴有时到我家住过，除跳舞外我从来没有同她谈过什么政治问题，五二年以后来往渐少，五四年以后就没有来往，她去鞍山休养的时候曾向我借了三十元，此外没有什么物质资助。五五年才听说她以反革命犯被捕，才知道她是反革命分子。今年春她来信说人民检察院已不起诉释放了。她来见我一次谈了十几分钟，主要是谈被捕和释放的经过，并送她的申诉文件请转人大常委人民接待室，我同一般人民来信照转的，她的申诉不仅是请我转的一份，还有由其他转去的，此后又寄来一份我没有转。我以往不该同不明底细的人来往，现在尤不该接见宽大处理的反革命分子。
    总之我的反党、反人民、反社会主义的言论和行动并不是偶然的，是有历史根源的，前后一贯的，随着社会主义建设的进展而更多暴露出来。我对各代表、各同志善意的批判帮助接受得很少很晚，有时甚至把善意误成恶意，而有抵抗的情绪，是由于我具有顽固的反动思想的缘故，现在我坦白地供认出来，希望继续批判帮助。
    丙、过去我的历史罪恶和现在我的认识：
    各位代表、各位同志揭发我过去历史上许多罪恶，绝大部分我是承认的，某些是与事实有出入的，在这里我不想答辩，我总的认为都是对我具有教育意义的。解放以来蒙党和人民的宽大待遇，给予学习工作的机会，理应如何感谢党和人民，反省自己的罪恶历史，好好改造自己，为人民服务，向人民赎罪，但我却把历史的罪恶忘了，思想模糊，立场不稳，以致发生许多反党、反人民、反社会主义的言论和行动，不但人情所不许，也为法理所不容。如果不是各位代表、各位同志用历史的镜子照出我的罪恶面貌，我就无法知道我现在所犯的严重错误是由历史的根源上来的，我愿意把历史的镜子时常摆在面前作为改过赎罪的鉴戒。
    这次反右派斗争的意义是非常伟大的，没有这次斗争就无法分清是非、分清敌我，把右派反动分子的罪恶面貌揭露出来。我在这次斗争中扮演了一个可耻可恨的、令人心痛的脚色，当起首受到批评的时候，自己还以为是忠心耿耿的受到委屈，却忘记了自己历史的罪恶根源，却不知道自己的思想立场愈来愈深地走到反动的方向。现在我认识了自己的错误和罪行，我内心感到非常痛苦，感到无面目以见人民，使我认识到如果不猛醒回头、痛下决心，从根本上改造自己的错误思想、改变自己的错误立场，那就是自绝于人民了。
    党和人民是宽大的，在这次斗争中教育了右派分子，把那些迷失本性、迷失方向的人救醒了过来，我是得救的一个，我感谢党和人民再生再造的恩德，我现在诚心诚意的向党和人民认罪，今后决心彻头彻尾的改正错误作为赎罪的表现，我愿受应得的处分。
