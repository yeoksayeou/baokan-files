    The dark side of American prisons has gradually been revealed in recent years. According to the "New York Prison Association," nearly one hundred major riots have occurred in prisons across the United States from 1950 to 1956. Prison property losses exceeded ten million U.S. dollars. The 1954 Missouri State Prison riot, in addition to causing casualties, also resulted in property losses of five million U.S. dollars. Since 1950, two-thirds of American prisons have experienced major riots. The main reasons for the riots are poor management and inadequate facilities. The "New York Prison Association" said that 89% of state government prisons in the United States were built more than fifty years ago, lack sanitary facilities, are overcrowded, and are prone to fire. The attitude of the American judicial authorities towards criminals is called "treating them harshly." The constant prison riots are also related to the inhumane treatment in prisons.

    美国监狱状况恶劣
    近年以来，美国监狱黑幕逐渐揭开。据“纽约监狱协会”透露，从1950年至1956年，美国各地监狱发生严重骚乱事件将近一百起。监狱财产损失一千万美元以上。1954年密苏里州监狱暴动，除了造成伤亡事故，还损失财产五百万美元。自1950年以来，三分之二的美国监狱都发生过重大的骚乱。骚乱的主要原因是由于管理不善、设备过差。“纽约监狱协会”说，美国各州的州政府监狱，89％的建筑物都是在五十年以前建造的，缺乏卫生设备，过于拥挤，容易酿成火灾。美国司法当局对待罪犯的态度叫做“狠狠地对待他们”。不断的监狱暴动也是同监狱里非人道的待遇有关系的。
