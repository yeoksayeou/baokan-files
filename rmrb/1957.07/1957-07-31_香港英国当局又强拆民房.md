Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 29th: The British authorities in Hong Kong today dispatched more than one hundred armed police officers to forcibly demolish civilian houses in Section 2 of the western part of the United Village of Chuk Yuen, Kowloon. This is the first phase, second batch of demolition sites in the Hong Kong British authorities' plan to forcibly demolish civilian houses in the ten villages north of Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon.

After the first batch of civilian houses was forcibly demolished on June 25, the "Joint Support Association of Thirteen Villages in Kowloon for Chuk Yuen Villagers" repeatedly requested negotiations with the Hong Kong British authorities to provide villagers with reasonable compensation and resettlement. However, like the previous batch of houses that were demolished, the houses demolished today did not receive adequate compensation from the Hong Kong British authorities.

    香港英国当局又强拆民房
    据新华社香港29日电　香港英国当局今天又派出一百多名武装警察，强拆九龙竹园联合乡西二段的民房。这是香港英国当局实施强拆九龙启德机场以北十乡民房计划的第一期第二批拆迁地段。
    在6月25日第一批民房被强迫拆毁后，“九龙十三乡联合支援竹园村民会”曾一再要求同香港英国当局谈判，给乡民合理的赔偿和安置。但是，今天被拆毁的民房和上一批被拆的民房一样，都没有得到香港英国当局的适当赔偿。
