    Nine Years of Abundance
    From 130,000 Kilowatts to 500,000 Kilowatts
    (Reported by Jilin Daily) The power generation capacity of the Fengman Hydroelectric Station has increased from 130,000 kilowatts to nearly 500,000 kilowatts. It is estimated that the power generation capacity can be increased to 570,000 kilowatts after the completion of all expansion plans in 1958.
    The increase in the power generation capacity of the Fengman Hydropower Station has been greatly assisted by the Soviet people. The Fengman Hydropower Station was originally a hydropower project that was not finally completed by Japanese imperialism. When the Kuomintang fled in defeat, it also sabotaged it. After the liberation in March 1948, it was only after nine days and nights of rescue by all employees that power was restored. However, at that time, the hydropower station still faced serious difficulties such as the incomplete special projects and water leakage in the dam body. According to the agreement between our country and the Soviet government, in 1951 the Soviet government sent a group of water conservancy experts to Fengman to help with the work. Later, the Soviet government also helped the hydropower station to expand its power generation equipment. The power generation equipment designed and manufactured with Soviet assistance is much more advanced than that of Japanese imperialism. The capacity of each generator designed by the Japanese was 65,000 kilowatts, while the Soviet design was 72,500 kilowatts. The increased capacity of one generator is almost equivalent to the capacity of a small thermal power plant. In terms of power transmission equipment, the Soviet Union helped design and manufacture air switches, which are safer and more economical than the oil switches used by the Japanese. In four years, the Soviet government supplied the Fengman Hydropower Station with 362,500 kilowatts of turbine generator sets, 450,000 kVA transformer equipment, and many sets of switch equipment such as 154,000 volts and 220,000 volts. Therefore, the Fengman Hydropower Station was able to increase its power generation capacity from 130,000 kilowatts to nearly 500,000 kilowatts, and increase its power transmission capacity to the north and south of Northeast China by more than double, and increase its power transmission capacity to the Jilin area by eight times. Soviet experts also helped the hydropower station train technical personnel who can independently build new hydropower stations, and helped them learn the technology and organizational work of managing such large-scale hydropower stations.
    Zhao Qingfu, a representative of the National People's Congress, a famous labor model, and deputy director and deputy chief engineer of the Fengman Hydropower Station, said to the reporter of Jilin Daily when introducing these achievements: All our employees are very angry at the right-wing elements' attacks on the Party and the people, especially Long Yun's anti-Soviet slanders. Last year, when I accompanied Comrade Peng Zhen's delegation of the National People's Congress to visit the Soviet Union, Long Yun also went. We visited various places in the Soviet Union and saw various machines made by Soviet comrades for China in many factories. However, after returning to China, he wantonly provoked Sino-Soviet friendship, which is really intolerable! (Attached photo)

### 丰满九年  从十三万瓩到五十万瓩

    丰满九年
    从十三万瓩到五十万瓩
    本报讯  吉林日报消息：丰满水力发电站的发电能力，已经由十三万瓩增加到近五十万瓩。到1958年全部扩建计划完成以后，发电能力预计可提高到五十七万瓩。
    丰满水电站发电能力的增加，曾得到苏联人民很大的帮助。丰满水电站原来是日本帝国主义没有最后建成的一项水力发电工程，国民党败走时还将它破坏了。1948年3月解放以后，经过全体职工九昼夜的抢救，才恢复送电。但是当时这个水电站仍然面临着特殊工程没有完成、堤身漏水等严重困难。根据我国同苏联政府的协定，1951年苏联政府就派了一个水利专家组到丰满帮助工作。后来，苏联政府又帮助这个水电站进行了发电设备的扩建。苏联帮助设计和制造的发电设备，比日本帝国主义的先进得多。日本人设计的发电机每台能力是六万五千瓩，苏联设计的是七万二千五百瓩。一台发电机增加的能力，就几乎相当于一个小型火力发电站的容量。在送电设备方面，苏联帮助设计和制造的是采用空气开关，比日本人利用油开关既安全又经济。苏联政府在四年间供给丰满水电站的工业设备，有三十六万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机组，四十五万千伏安变压器设备，以及十五万四千、二十二万电压等很多组开关设备。因此，丰满水电站才能够把发电能力从十三万瓩提高到近五十万瓩，并把对东北地区南北部送电的能力提高一倍以上，把对吉林地区的送电能力提高八倍。苏联专家还帮助这个水电站培养了能够独立建设新型水电站的技术人材，并帮助他们学会了管理这样大型水电站的技术和组织工作。
    全国人民代表大会代表、著名劳动模范、丰满水力发电站副厂长兼副总工程师赵庆夫同志，在对吉林日报记者介绍这些成就的时候说：我们全体职工对右派分子向党和人民的进攻，特别是对龙云之流的反苏谰言非常愤恨。去年，我随同彭真同志率领的人大代表团访问苏联的时候，龙云也去了。我们在苏联各地参观，在许多工厂中都看到了苏联同志们为中国制造的各种机器。但是回国以后，他却大肆挑拨中苏友谊，这实在令人不能容忍！（附图片）
