Xinhua News Agency, 24th: In the vast areas of central and eastern Henan Province, the vast areas of southern and western Shandong Province, some areas of northern Anhui Province, and the Yishui and Shushui river basins in northern Jiangsu Province, the broad masses of the people are still fighting against the floods and waterlogging disasters caused by prolonged heavy rainfall under the leadership of the Party and the government.

The southern boundary of this rainstorm area did not reach the main stream of the Huai River, so as of now, the Huai River's water situation is basically stable.

The rainstorm began on July 6 and continued until the 19th, with four to five heavy rainfalls, each lasting two to three days. In Shandong Province, the last rainfall lasted for four days from the 16th to the 19th. The rain area stretched from the coastal area east of Linyi in Shandong, westward through the central and southern Shandong mountains, the southwestern Shandong plains, the eastern Henan plains, the western Henan mountains, all the way to the vicinity of Xi'an, forming a long and narrow east-west rain belt roughly parallel to the Yellow River. The rainfall was strongest in eastern Shandong, generally exceeding 500 millimeters, more than three times the average rainfall for July in previous years, which is rare in decades. The rainfall was heaviest in Baofeng and Xuchang areas of Henan, with Baofeng reaching 624 millimeters, more than three times the average rainfall for July in previous years. Northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu areas close to Henan and Shandong also experienced heavy rainfall.

This time, the rainfall south of the Yellow River in Shandong was the heaviest and most concentrated. The ground could not absorb it in time, resulting in large runoff. Low-lying areas were the first to experience waterlogging, and the Yi and Shu rivers could not discharge the water in time. At 23:00 on the 19th, the flow rate at the Linyi station of the Yi River reached 15,500 cubic meters per second, creating an extraordinarily large flood rarely seen in history. The Yexian station of the Shahe River in Henan also experienced an extraordinarily large flood of 10,500 cubic meters per second. During the torrential rain, the southwestern Shandong and eastern Henan plains often experienced a phenomenon where the water depth reached about one meter on flat ground.

According to preliminary estimates from the above-mentioned provinces, approximately 45 million mu of farmland have suffered from varying degrees of waterlogging or flood disasters caused by the overflowing and breaching of various rivers. Among them, preliminary estimates for Henan are more than 22 million mu, and for Shandong, more than 17 million mu. Now, it has been sunny for a few days, and the rivers are receding. In addition, with the vigorous drainage and rescue efforts in various places, some flood or shallow waterlogged areas have been gradually drained. For example, nearly 2 million mu have been drained from the waterlogged areas in northern Anhui.

During the rainstorm, some villages on the southwestern Shandong and eastern Henan plains were surrounded by floodwaters, and traffic in a few county towns was blocked by floodwaters. Some houses collapsed in both urban and rural areas during the rainstorm, causing some deaths, injuries, and material losses.

This rainstorm area extended westward to the vicinity of Xi'an in Shaanxi. There were also some mountain floods and waterlogging of small areas in the mountains south of Xi'an and near Xi'an.

This rainstorm area is close to the south bank of the Yellow River. Due to the rising water levels of the Yellow River's tributaries such as the Wei River, the Yellow River's flow rate exceeded 10,000 cubic meters per second. On the afternoon of the 23rd, the Yellow River flood peak had passed Aishan and continued to flow downstream. Due to proper defense, this Yellow River flood only overflowed onto the滩地 within the embankment below Dongbatou in Lankao County, Henan.

During the rainstorm, the Party and government at all levels led the people, with the support of the People's Liberation Army, to fight the floods and carry out rescue efforts, greatly reducing the disasters that the rainstorm could have caused. The Shandong and Henan provincial, municipal, and county Party committees and the commissioners and county heads in the rain-affected areas, some of them went to the embankments to participate in flood prevention and rescue, while others led cadres to rescue the people trapped by the floodwaters. People from all walks of life in urban and rural areas participated in the battle against the floods. In Henan Province alone, more than 26,000 cadres participated in flood prevention, rescue, and relief work.

The troops stationed in the rain-affected areas became an important force in flood prevention, rescue, and relief work. They defended many important embankments and rescued many people and materials. The People's Navy sent a large number of rubber shoes, life jackets, and life buoys to the rain-affected areas, the Engineering Corps sent a large number of flood control materials, and the People's Air Force participated in the transportation and rescue work of these materials.

During this period, the Central Flood Control Headquarters commanded the flood prevention and rescue work in this rain-affected area day and night, allocating a large amount of flood control funds and materials. The State Council has allocated emergency relief funds and increased agricultural loans to Shandong and other provinces. Working groups from the Ministry of Internal Affairs have gone to Shandong and other provinces to understand the disaster situation and assist in the work.

During this period, the people of Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and other cities also sent many materials to the rain-affected areas to support rescue efforts.

Now, the above-mentioned rain-affected areas have begun to vigorously drain the floodwaters and rescue the crops.

    豫鲁皖苏四千五百万亩农田受害
    党和政府领导人民正在和洪水内涝奋战
    据新华社24日讯　河南省中部、东部广大地区，山东省南部、西部广大地区，安徽省淮北部分地区和江苏省北部沂、沭河流域，广大人民仍在党和政府的领导下，同长期暴雨造成的洪水和内涝灾害奋战。
    这次暴雨区南界未达到淮河干流，因而截至目前，淮河干流水情基本上还是平稳的。
    这次暴雨是7月6日开始的，一直到19日为止共下了四次到五次暴雨，每次都是两天到三天，山东省最后从16日到19日下了四天。雨区从山东临沂以东的沿海一带，往西经过鲁中南山地、鲁西南平原、豫东平原、豫西山地一直到西安附近，形成一个大体同黄河平行的东西狭长的雨带。东部山东境内雨量最强，普遍在五百公厘以上，超过历年7月平均雨量的三倍，是几十年来少见的。河南宝丰、许昌一带雨量最大，宝丰达六百二十四公厘，超过历年7月平均雨量三倍多。皖北、苏北临近河南、山东的地带也下了暴雨。
    这次在山东黄河以南的雨量最大最集中，地面下渗不及，径流很大，低洼地带首先发生积涝，沂、沭等河流也宣泄不及，19日二十三时，沂河临沂站流量曾达一万五千五百秒公方，造成历史罕有的特大洪水。河南沙河叶县站也曾出现过一万零五百秒公方的特大洪水。在暴雨倾盆的时候，鲁西南和豫东平原，往往造成平地水深一公尺左右的现象。
    据上述各省初步估计：大约有四千五百万亩农田，遭受了不同程度内涝灾害或各河漫堤、决口所造成的洪水灾害。其中，河南初步估计为二千二百多万亩，山东为一千七百多万亩。现在，已经晴了几天，各河都在回落，加以各地大力排水抢救，部分洪水或积水较浅的地区已陆续排出。如皖北积水地区就已排出近二百万亩。
    暴雨中，鲁西南和豫东平原上都有一些农村被积水所围，也有少数县城的交通曾被积水所阻断。无论城乡在暴雨中都倒坍了一些房屋，造成了一些死伤和物资损失。
    这次暴雨区往西一直延及陕西的西安一带，西安以南的山地和西安附近也有面积不大的山洪和积涝。
    这次暴雨区临近黄河南岸，由于黄河支流渭河等河涨水，因而使黄河出现了超过一万秒公方的流量。23日下午，黄河洪峰已过艾山，正继续下泄。这次黄河涨水，由于防守得宜，仅在河南兰考县东坝头以下漫上了堤内的滩地。
    暴雨中，各地党和政府领导人民，在人民解放军的支援下和洪水搏斗和进行抢救，大大减轻了这次暴雨所能够造成的灾害。山东和河南中共各级党委和雨区的专员、县长这次有的上堤抢险防洪，有的就率领干部抢救被水围困的人民。城乡各阶层的人民都参加了防洪的战斗。河南省参加防洪抢险和抢救工作的干部就达两万六千多人。
    雨区的驻军成了防洪抢险和抢救工作中的一支重要的力量，他们守住了许多重要的堤防，救出了不少的人民和物资。人民海军给雨区送了大批的橡皮鞋、救生衣、救生圈，工程兵给雨区送了大批的防汛器材，人民空军参加对这些物资的输送和抢救工作。
    在此期间，中央防汛总指挥部夜以继日指挥着这个雨区的防汛抢救工作，增拨了大批防汛经费和防汛物资。国务院已给山东等省拨了急救款和增拨了农业贷款。内务部的工作组已分赴山东等省了解灾情和协助工作。
    在此期间，北京、上海、南京、徐州等城市的人民，也向雨区输送许多物资支援抢救。
    现在，上述雨区已开始大力排除积水和抢救田禾。
