Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 29th: The Henan Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) held a meeting yesterday to initially expose the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of Zhang Zhen, a member of the RCCK Central Committee and a rightist. Zhang Zhen was the former puppet governor of Henan Province and is now a deputy to the National People's Congress and vice governor of Henan Province.

According to Li Pingyi and Gao Yangyuan at the meeting, Zhang Zhen consistently spoke for the landlord class and hated the laboring people. In 1955, when Zhang Zhen inspected work in Henan, he openly said that all of his time "was spent visiting landlords and rich peasants to understand their living conditions." At the White Horse Temple in Luoyang, Zhang Zhen always went out alone to talk to landlords, rich peasants, and people who were "dissatisfied" with the Party. When he visited prisons, even though prisoners told him that their families could visit them and that the money they earned through their own labor could still be sent home, Zhang Zhen everywhere slandered the Communist Party for not allowing prisoners' families to visit. When he inspected Kaifeng, his interviewees were all his "old subordinates."

Fang Xihua and others revealed that Zhang Zhen applauded the Hungarian incident and said, "China should also have a Hungarian incident," and also praised the counter-revolutionary bandits in Hungary for brutally killing public security personnel. According to reports, Zhang Zhen hated public security personnel very much and expressed "respect" for Huang Shaohong's anti-Communist speech. He also "spoke up" for the families of counter-revolutionary elements who had been suppressed.

Everyone who spoke at the meeting exposed Zhang Zhen's consistent anti-Communist and anti-people facts. Duan Ruohong, a member of the RCCK, revealed that during the seven or eight years that Zhang Zhen ruled Henan, he killed countless Communist Party members and upright people, and stubbornly resisted the southward advance of the People's Liberation Army. The Kuomintang 13th Army, which he led, committed all kinds of evil in the countryside.

Zhang Zhen is currently in Beijing. The people who attended the meeting demanded that he return to Henan to bow his head and confess his crimes to the people.

    张轸一贯为反革命分子鸣冤为地主阶级说话
    民革河南省委要他回河南认罪
    据新华社郑州29日电　民革河南省委员会昨天集会，初步揭发民革中央委员、右派分子张轸反共反社会主义的言行。张轸是伪河南省省主席，现在是全国人民代表大会代表、河南省副省长。
    据李平一、高仰源在会上揭发，张轸一贯为地主阶级说话，仇恨劳动人民。1955年张轸到河南视察工作时，就公开说他的全部时间“是访问地主、富农，了解他们的生活情况。”张轸在洛阳白马寺，总是一个人出去找地主、富农和对党“不满”的人谈话。他到监狱访问时，虽然犯人告诉他，他们的家属可以来看望，他们自己劳动得来的钱还能寄回家中，但张轸却到处污蔑共产党不允许犯人家属探监。他在开封视察时，访问对象都是他的“老部下”。
    房西华等人揭发，张轸对匈牙利事件拍手叫好，并说：“中国也该有个匈牙利事件”，对匈牙利的反革命匪徒残杀公安人员的暴行也很赞许。据揭发，张轸十分痛恨公安人员，向黄绍竑的反共发言表示“致敬”。并为被镇压的反革命分子的家属“鸣冤”。
    会上所有发言的人都揭露了张轸一贯反共反人民的事实。民革成员段若虹揭露，张轸在河南统治的七、八年中，杀害过无数共产党员和正直人士，顽强抵抗解放军南下。他所带的国民党十三军，在农村是无恶不作的。
    张轸现在北京。参加会议的人要求他回到河南来向人民低头认罪。
