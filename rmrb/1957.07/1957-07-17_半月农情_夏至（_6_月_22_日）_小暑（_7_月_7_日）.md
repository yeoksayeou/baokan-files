Bi-Monthly Agricultural Situation
Summer Solstice (June 22) – Minor Heat (July 7)

The early rice in the southern regions of Guangdong, Fujian, and Yunnan (eastern Guangdong, southern Fujian, and subtropical Yunnan) has been basically harvested, and the early rice in the northern regions is being harvested. In the provinces of the Yangtze River basin, most of the early rice is heading and filling, and some is drooping ready for harvest. In most parts of the country, cotton fields have entered the flowering period. In North China, spring-sown corn is already more than half a person tall, and the summer-sown crops that have been planted are generally emerging. The Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions have entered a tense stage of summer weeding. Rice transplanting in the northern regions has come to an end. This is the basic situation of agricultural production in the past half month.

Relaxing summer weeding carries the risk of abandoning cultivation.

In the northern miscellaneous grain producing areas, the period from late June to early July is generally still in the summer weeding stage. Summer weeding in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions is becoming increasingly tense compared to other regions. Crops replanted after the wheat harvest are emerging one after another, and farmers in provinces such as Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong are engaged in thinning seedlings.

Some areas have similar natural conditions, but the progress of summer weeding varies greatly. Some areas in Liaoning and Jilin have finished the first weeding and are entering the second, but some areas in Inner Mongolia have not even started the first weeding. From late June onwards, temperatures in the northern regions gradually rise, and grass seedlings grow rapidly. In areas where summer weeding is slow, there is a risk of abandoning cultivation if they do not catch up quickly.

Cotton seedlings are growing well, and management cannot be relaxed.

Cotton growth is good in most areas, generally one to one and a half feet tall. Early-sown cotton fields have young bolls appearing.

Cotton seedlings in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces are better than last year. Cotton in Shanxi was initially slow due to low temperatures in spring, but it turned around around late June. There is a shortage of seedlings in cotton fields in provinces such as Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang. Cotton in Liaoning Province generally grows well, but some areas were affected by hail in late June.

Since mid-June, many cotton-growing areas have generally experienced insect pests, mainly cotton aphids. Some agricultural cooperatives in cotton-growing areas only pay attention to the prevention and control of small, high-yielding cotton fields, and relax the work of aphid control in large-area cotton fields. At present, cotton aphids are still harming cotton seedlings, and cotton bollworms have also occurred. Controlling both of these pests is an important task in the recent period.

Cotton topdressing should generally begin in early July. Is there enough fertilizer for topdressing? What to do if it is not enough? Each region and each production unit must specifically calculate this.

Prepare for seizing the harvest and seizing the planting.

After the "Great Heat," the provinces of the Yangtze River basin will begin to harvest early rice. Preparing for and welcoming the harvest is the current task of agricultural cooperatives in these areas.

In these areas, after the early rice is harvested, late rice must be transplanted immediately. There is generally only a twenty-day gap from harvesting early rice to transplanting late rice. Therefore, properly arranging the labor force for seizing the harvest and seizing the planting is essential to harvest early rice well and plant late rice well.

### 半月农情  夏至（6月22日）——小暑（7月7日）

    半月农情
    夏至（6月22日）——小暑（7月7日）
    广东、福建、云南的南部地区（粤东、闽南、云南亚热带）的早稻已经基本收割完毕，北部地区的早稻正在收获。长江流域各省的早稻大部抽穗灌浆，有的勾头待收。全国多数地区的棉田已进入开花期。华北地区的春播玉米已有半人多高，已播的夏种作物普遍出苗。东北和内蒙古等地进入紧张的夏锄阶段。北方地区的水稻插秧已告结束。这就是近半个月农业生产的基本情况。
    放松夏锄，就有撩荒的危险
    北方杂粮产区，6月下旬到7月上旬一般还是处在夏锄阶段。东北和内蒙古地区的夏锄比别的地区日见紧张。麦收后复种的作物相继出苗，陕西、河南、河北、山东等省的农民都投入了间苗工作。
    有些地区自然条件相差不多，但是夏锄进度快慢悬殊。辽宁、吉林有些地区已经锄完了头遍，进入二遍，可是，内蒙古有的地区连头遍还没有动手。北方地区由6月下旬起气温渐高，草苗生长迅速，夏锄缓慢的地区，不急起直追就有撩荒的危险。
    棉苗生长好，管理不能松
    大部地区的棉花生长良好，一般苗高一尺到一尺半。早播的棉田，已出现幼铃。
    河北、山东、河南、湖北、江苏等省的棉苗比去年好。山西的棉花因春季气温低一度生长迟缓，到6月下旬前后就转过来了。陕西、甘肃、新疆等省的棉田有缺苗现象。辽宁省的棉花一般生长较好，但是部分地区在6月下旬受到雹害。
    许多棉区自6月中旬以来普遍发生虫害，其中主要是棉蚜。有些棉区的农业社只重视小块丰产棉田的防治，放松大面积棉田的治蚜工作。目前棉蚜还在为害棉苗，棉铃虫又已发生。兼治这两种害虫是最近一个时期的重要事情。
    棉花追肥，一般应该由7月初开始。追肥用的肥料够不够？不够怎么办？每个地区，每个生产单位都要具体地合计一下。
    作好抢收抢插的准备
    “大暑”以后，长江流域各省就要开始收割早稻。作好准备，迎接丰收是这些地区农业社的当前任务。
    在这些地区，早稻收割以后，就要立即栽插连作晚稻。从收早稻到插晚稻一般只有二十天的空隙。因此，妥善安排抢收抢插的劳力，才能收好早稻，插好晚稻。
