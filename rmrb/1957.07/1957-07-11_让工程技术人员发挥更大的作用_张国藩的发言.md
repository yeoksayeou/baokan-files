I fully agree with the reports made to the conference by Premier Zhou and several other leaders.

This year is the last year of the First Five-Year Plan. According to the results of inspections from various sources, the implementation of this plan has been good. By the end of this year, the plan will definitely be completed in all aspects, even exceeded. The completion of this plan fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system and fully proves how the power of the people, once liberated, will promote the development of productive forces with overwhelming force. In just a few years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have realized many dreams of the past century. Every patriotic Chinese person cannot but feel proud of having such a great party. Facts speak louder than words, but the rightists stubbornly close their eyes to the facts, attempting to use all kinds of lies to provoke distrust of the people towards the Communist Party. This despicable trick is definitely doomed to failure and is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

The completion of the First Five-Year Plan not only laid a solid material foundation for China's industrialization, but also created rich experiences for us in various construction endeavors, and established a more solid confidence for the people of the whole country to continue advancing on the socialist road. We must carefully summarize these experiences in order to more forcefully accelerate socialist construction.

This is not to say that there were no problems in our past work. Since much of the work was completely new, the existence of problems is natural. Problems are contradictions. Chairman Mao taught us that as long as we can correctly handle contradictions, the resolution of contradictions is the driving force for us to move forward.

Below, I will talk about the issue of giving full play to the role of engineering and technical personnel, as well as their training and improvement.

I recently inspected several relatively large factories and enterprises in Tianjin City, specifically to understand some of the problems that technical personnel felt. The steps for understanding were to first talk with the leading comrades of the units, and then talk separately with the older technical personnel and the younger technical personnel. Many issues were discussed, and I will only talk about three of the more prominent ones below, and provide some suggestions along the way.

How to Better Combine Technical Leadership and Administrative Leadership

In some units, engineers or higher-level technicians are responsible for the administrative leadership responsibilities of divisions, sections, or offices. These people are busy with administrative affairs all day long and have little time to address technical issues, feeling very distressed. Because they have little time to devote to technical leadership, they often do not review designs or provide technical guidance carefully enough. The technical personnel under them have a lot of complaints because they cannot get their guidance when they encounter problems. Some of their designs can only be "copied blindly" and sent up, which may lead to quality accidents or cause great waste. This problem is serious.

Then, is it not good to not let these senior technical personnel concurrently serve as administrative leaders? Some units do it this way: they let technical personnel focus on technical issues and let non-technical personnel be responsible for administrative leadership. But this also has problems. Technical personnel complain that their technical opinions often do not get the support of administrative leaders and therefore cannot be implemented. Such administrative leaders, because they do not understand technical issues well enough, inevitably focus more on administrative tasks and less on technical requirements. For example, the leader of a railway surveying team (who was not a technical person himself), in a survey task, insisted on bringing the team back because the scheduled deadline had arrived, even though the engineer suggested that they should stay for a few more days to collect unfinished data; in the end, this caused rework. This resulted in losses in the work.

How to better combine technical leadership and administrative leadership is a very important issue that must be resolved. I believe that technical personnel should give full play to their strengths, and first of all, they should focus their energy on researching and solving technical problems. Generally, it is better not to hold administrative leadership positions. In places where conditions permit, it is necessary to have technical personnel concurrently manage administrative leadership work, they should be equipped with strong assistants to help them manage routine administrative affairs. Although technical personnel do not hold administrative leadership positions, their opinions on technical issues must be respected. The implementation of various procedures such as surveying, design, and construction must be reviewed and signed by qualified engineers to be considered qualified. In this way, technical personnel can give full play to their strengths, which will guarantee the improvement of product and project quality.

The Training and Improvement of Technical Personnel

All technical personnel in production units have an urgent need to improve their technical level. Among them, a small number of people have the idea of separating from production and separating from reality. They want to bury themselves in books or engage in research work that is far from the needs of production within the factory. This idea is wrong. However, most people realize that the increasing improvement of production technology and feel that their original "capital" is not enough, and they require more opportunities for learning and improvement. This requirement is completely correct, and we must vigorously support it. At present, the support given by industrial and mining enterprises and institutions of higher learning in this regard is far from enough and must be greatly strengthened.

Taking spare-time education as an example, now the institutions of higher learning, whether they run night universities or correspondence universities, want to make their teaching plans as similar as possible to the teaching plans of regular universities. The study time is more than six years, and the courses to be studied are more than twenty. In this way, due to the limitations of conditions, the number of people who can enroll is very small. I think the number of courses in night universities should be greatly reduced. The number of regular courses should be reduced to less than ten, and all of them can be completed in three years. Non-regular courses only offer specialized courses and lectures. A certificate of completion is given after completing one course. In this way, a large number of in-service technical personnel can "take what they need" and get opportunities for improvement. Please also study whether this opinion is appropriate.

Streamline Meetings, Cherish Time

The several factories and enterprises I inspected all felt that the amount of time spent in meetings was too much, which is a common problem. In addition to the normal activities of the Party, League, and Trade Union within the factory, there are also meetings on production quotas, meetings on awarding prizes and model workers, and meetings on labor competitions. Many of these meetings directly related to production are necessary. The problem is that the meetings are far more than these. There are meetings to promote the Marriage Law, meetings to crack down on criminals, meetings on grain distribution, meetings on hygiene and cleanliness, and all other city-wide movements and study meetings must be attended without exception. The more leading cadres are, the more meetings they have. Some factory directors said that they have very little time to consider production issues. Section and group leaders often spend five or six hours of their eight-hour workday in meetings. We know that meetings are one of the important forms of democratic life in our country, and necessary meetings are indispensable. The problem is that some of our meetings are many but not refined, wasting a lot of time. It is natural that it is difficult to be refined if there are too many meetings.

All meetings, regardless of their nature, ultimately serve the purpose of preparing for production. If we spend too much time on preparation and too little time on formal production, even if the preparation work is done very well, there will be little time left for production. No matter how well prepared, it is difficult to produce the desired effect. Moreover, many problems can only be clarified through production practice. If less time is spent in practice, the collected raw data will be insufficient, and even if more time is spent in meetings to prepare, it may be building castles in the air, to no avail.

Although we have carried out a movement against "five excesses" for a while, the results in streamlining meetings are not very significant. When everyone talks about it, it seems that there is no way to avoid too many meetings. But I believe that as long as we are determined, there is no way. Recently, the official meeting of the State Council's Science Planning Commission only lasted for three days, and the meeting was very good, and some major issues were resolved. This proves that as long as we are determined to streamline meetings, this is completely possible.

I suggest that in the future, the number of meetings held by a unit and the quality of the organization of meetings should be taken as one of the main contents of checking work performance. Those who hold many meetings and do not organize them well should be severely criticized. This is about how to arrange everyone's production time, and it is about the speed of socialist construction. "An inch of time is worth an inch of gold." In order to accelerate socialist construction, we must develop the habit of cherishing time.

The above opinions may have many errors, please correct me.

### 让工程技术人员发挥更大的作用  张国藩的发言

    让工程技术人员发挥更大的作用
    张国藩的发言
    我完全同意周总理和其他几位首长向大会所作的报告。
    今年是第一个五年计划的最后一年，根据各方面检查的结果，这个计划的执行情况是良好的，到今年年度终了，这个计划一定能全面完成以至超额完成的。这个计划的完成就充分证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性，充分证明了人民的力量一旦获得解放之后，将如何以雷霆万钧之势推动生产力向前发展。在短短几年之间，中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，实现了百年以来许多梦想。每一个爱国的中国人无不感到有这样伟大的党而自豪。事实胜于雄辩，而右派分子偏闭眼不看事实，企图用各种谎言挑拨人民对共产党的信任。这种卑鄙的伎俩是肯定不能得逞的，是中国人民所绝对不能容许的。
    第一个五年计划的完成不但为我国工业化打下了有力的物质基础，也为我们在各种建设事业中创造了丰富的经验，为全国人民在社会主义道路上继续前进，树立了更牢固的信心。我们要很好地总结这些经验，以便更有力地加速社会主义建设。
    这不是说我们过去的工作中没有问题。由于很多工作是完全新的工作，问题的存在是很自然的。问题就是矛盾。毛主席教导我们，只要能正确处理矛盾，矛盾的解决就是推动我们前进的动力。
    我下面谈一谈关于发挥工程技术人员的作用以及他们的培养和提高问题。
    我最近视察了天津市的几个比较大的工厂和企业单位，专门了解技术人员所感到的一些问题。了解的步骤是先与单位的领导同志谈，再分别与老的技术人员和青年技术人员谈。谈的问题很多，下面只说比较突出的三个问题，并顺便提供几点意见。
    技术领导与行政领导如何结合得更好
    有的单位是让工程师或较高的技术员负责处、科或室的行政领导责任。这些人终日忙于行政事务，很少时间过问技术方面的问题，感到很苦。由于能用于技术领导的时间少，他们经常对设计的审核，技术的指导，做得就不够认真。他们手下的技术人员，碰到问题得不到他们的指导，也很有意见。他们有的设计只好“依样画葫芦”送上去了事，结果就可能发生质量事故，或造成很大的浪费。这个问题是严重的。
    那末，不让这些高级技术人员兼任行政领导工作不好么？有的单位就是这样作的：他们让技术人员专管技术问题，让非技术人员负责行政领导工作。但是这样也有问题。技术人员抱怨说，他们的技术意见常常得不到行政领导的支持，因而不能贯彻。这样的行政领导，由于对技术问题了解不够，就不免对行政任务的问题考虑的多，对技术的要求考虑的少。例如有一个铁道勘测队的领队人（本人不是搞技术的），在一次勘测任务中，因为预定期限到了，就坚决要把队带回来，虽然工程师建议应当继续留几天，收集未完的资料，他也不听；最后造成返工。这样就造成了工作中的损失。
    技术领导与行政领导如何结合得好，是一个很重要的问题，必须解决。我认为技术人员应该发挥所长，首先要把他们的精力放在研究解决技术问题上，一般以不担任行政领导工作为宜。在有条件的地方，必需要技术人员兼管行政领导工作的，就应该配备强有力的助手，协助他们管理经常行政事务工作。技术人员虽然不担任行政领导工作，但他们对于技术问题的意见必须受到尊重。勘测、设计、施工等各种程序的进行，必须要有有资格的工程师的审核签字，才算合格。这样，使技术人员能发挥所长，对提高产品和工程的质量才有保证。
    技术人员的培养和提高
    所有在生产单位的技术人员都有提高技术水平的迫切要求。其中有少数人有脱离生产、脱离实际的想法。他们想在工厂内专啃书本或者搞一些距离生产需要很远的研究工作，这种想法是不对的。但大多数人认识到生产技术水平的日益提高，感到自己原来的“本钱”不够，要求有更多的学习和提高的机会，这种要求是完全正确的，我们必须大力支持。目前工矿企业部门和高等学校在这一方面所给的支持是很不够的，必须大力加强。
    就以业余教育来说，现在高等学校办的无论夜大学也好，函授大学也好，都是想使它们的教学计划尽量与正规大学的教学计划相似。学习时间要六年多，学习课程在二十门以上。这样，由于条件的限制，能入学的人数就很少。我认为夜大学的课程门数应当大大减少。正规科减少到十门以下，三年可以全部学完毕业。非正规科只开设专门课程讲座。学完一门给一张修业证书。这样就可使大量的在职技术人员“各取所需”，得到提高的机会。这个意见是否妥当，也请有关方面研究。
    精简会议，珍惜时间
    我视察的几个工厂和企业单位，都感到用于开会的时间太多是一个普遍的问题。除了厂内的党、团、工会的正常活动以外，还有关于生产定额的会，评奖评模的会，劳动竞赛的会。这些与生产直接有关的会，很多是必需的。问题是会议还远不只这些。宣传婚姻法要开会，打击刑事犯要开会，粮食配给要开会，卫生清洁要开会，其他所有市的运动和学习会都要参加，不能例外。越是领导干部，会议越多。有的厂长说，他很少时间来考虑生产问题。科、室、组长一天工作八小时，经常要用去五、六小时的时间开会。我们知道开会是我国民主生活的重要方式之一，必要的会是不可少的。问题是我们的有些会议是多而不精，浪费时间很大。开的太多就很难精，也是自然的。
    所有会议，无论它的性质如何，最终的目的，不过是为生产作准备工作。假如我们用在准备的时间太多了，而用在正式生产的时间太少了，就是准备工作做的很好，到生产的时候，所剩的时间已无几。准备得再好，也难产生应有的作用。何况有好多问题是要通过生产实践才能明确的。用在实践的时间少了，收集的原始资料就不够，纵然多用时间开会作准备工作，可能是空中造楼，徒劳无益。
    我们虽搞过一阵反“五多”的运动，但在精简会议方面，成绩不是很显著的。大家谈起来，好像会议太多是没有办法的事情。但我相信，只要有决心，不会没有办法。最近国务院科学规划委员会的正式会议只开了三天，会议开的很好，一些主要问题都解决了。这就证明只要我们有决心精简会议，这是完全可以做到的。
    我建议今后应把一个单位开会的多少和会议组织的好坏作为检查工作成绩的主要内容之一。召开会议多而组织不好的应受到严厉的批评。这是有关如何安排大家的生产时间问题，是有关社会主义的建设速度问题。“一寸光阴一寸金”，为加紧社会主义的建设，我们一定要养成珍惜时间的习惯。
    以上意见，可能有很多错误的地方，请各位代表指正。
