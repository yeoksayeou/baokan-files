Moscow, July 3rd (Reported by our newspaper) The Soviet Union has completed the reform of its industrial and construction management system. After nearly two months of intense work, one hundred and five economic zones have been established throughout the Soviet Union, and the State Planning Commissions of the Soviet Union and the various Union Republics have been reorganized.

National Economic Councils have been established in each economic zone. Their structures are flexible. In highly industrialized economic zones, the National Economic Council has specialized bureaus and trusts to lead enterprises; in economic zones with fewer factories and projects, these enterprises are directly led by the National Economic Council. Each National Economic Council has taken over many enterprises originally belonging to various industrial ministries in the area. This unified management has streamlined overlapping organizations. For example, after the establishment of the Tula Economic Zone National Economic Council, the Moscow Coal Mine Company and the Tula Coal Mine Company were merged into one, unified management of one hundred and four mines. As a result, many coal mine administrative organizations were abolished, reducing administrative personnel by one hundred and thirty-three, saving approximately two million rubles in wages annually. Each National Economic Council has absorbed many experienced and skilled cadres from the central industrial departments. For example, the personnel of the Novosibirsk National Economic Council, although mainly selected from local enterprises, also include many people who have come from the central industrial departments. Forty-five engineers went from Moscow, and another three hundred are scheduled to go.

The National Economic Councils of all economic zones in the Soviet Union began operating on July 1st. They are to ensure that the enterprises under their jurisdiction complete the state production tasks on time, and are responsible for formulating and implementing current and long-term plans for production and construction in various regions, improving the technical level of production, and planning the supply of materials within the economic zone and to other zones. Their scope of management is very broad, and there are many areas where the initiative of the localities and the masses can be brought into play. How are the various National Economic Councils starting their work? Some National Economic Councils immediately sent people to factories, mines, and construction sites to specifically help enterprises complete their production plans. For example, the Kuzbass coal mines exceeded their production target by 400,000 tons of coal in the first five months of this year, but some mines did not complete their production tasks. The staff of the Kemerovo Economic Zone National Economic Council immediately went to these backward mines to understand the situation, analyze the reasons, and take necessary measures. The National Economic Councils of Moscow, Kiev, Sverdlovsk, Leningrad, and other places are paying special attention to implementing the suggestions made by the masses during the nationwide discussion. The Sverdlovsk National Economic Council is starting to merge some enterprises of the same nature that previously belonged to different departments, such as merging the cement plant and the slate factory in Sukhoi Log, while studying the full utilization of local raw materials such as copper mines and copper-zinc mines. Many other National Economic Councils have begun to pay attention to establishing good mutual relations between economic zones and ensuring the timely supply of orders to each other. For example, the Altai Tractor Factory intended to produce a certain type of tractor, but had not received the necessary lathes for a long time. The Altai National Economic Council inquired with the Moscow (City) National Economic Council and quickly received a response. Twenty-eight lathes will be shipped to Altai in mid-July.

The various National Economic Councils maintain close contact with the State Planning Commission. The reorganized Soviet State Planning Commission relies on the State Planning Commissions of the Union Republics and the National Economic Councils to carry out its work. The Soviet State Planning Commission will send people to work with the latter to inspect the implementation of the national economic plan, and the State Planning Commissions of the Republics will report to the Soviet State Planning Commission on the production situation of each economic zone and make suggestions. The Soviet State Planning Commission will provide assistance to the National Economic Councils in the preparation of economic zone national economic development plans. In the future, the work of compiling the Soviet national economic plan will start directly from enterprises, construction sites, and National Economic Councils, attracting the participation of the broad masses. To adapt to the new conditions, all material supply stations formerly under the control of the central industrial and construction departments will be transferred to the National Economic Councils. Unified supply and marketing organizations will be established within the National Economic Councils to ensure that materials are supplied to enterprises and construction sites within the zone and to other zones in a timely manner, so that production and construction can proceed continuously according to plan.

    苏联完成工业和建设管理制度改革
    共建一百零五个经济区　改组了国家计划委员会
    本报莫斯科3日电　苏联工业和建设管理制度的改革已经完成。经过将近两个月的紧张工作，全苏建立了一百零五个经济区，改组了苏联和各加盟共和国的国家计划委员会。
    在各个经济区都成立了国民经济委员会。它们的机构是灵活的。在工业很发达的经济区，国民经济委员会下面设有专业局和托拉斯来领导企业，在工厂和工程不很多的经济区，这些企业由国民经济委员会直接领导。各个国民经济委员会接管了当地原属各工业部的众多的企业。这种统一管理，使重叠的机构得以精简。例如土拉经济区国民经济委员会成立后，把莫斯科煤矿公司与土拉煤矿公司合并为一，统一领导一百零四座矿井，因此取消了许多煤矿的行政机构，减少了一百三十三个行政人员，每年节约工资约二百万卢布。各个国民经济委员会从中央工业部门吸收了许多有经验的熟练干部。像新西伯利亚国民经济委员会的人员，主要虽然是从当地企业中挑选的，但是也有不少人是从中央工业部门下去的。从莫斯科去了四十五名工程师，还要去三百名。
    全苏各个经济区的国民经济委员会从7月1日开始活动。它们要保证所属企业及时完成国家生产任务，要负责制订和实现各地生产和建设的当前和远景计划，提高生产的技术水平，筹划本经济区以内和对外区的物资供应。它们管辖的范围很广，可以发挥地方和群众的积极性之处很多。目前，各国民经济委员会是怎样开始工作的呢？一些国民经济委员会立即派人深入到厂矿和工地去，具体帮助企业完成生产计划。例如库兹巴斯的煤矿在今年头五个月超额增产了四十万吨煤，但是其中有若干矿井没有完成生产任务。克米罗沃经济区的国民经济委员会工作人员立即到这些落后的矿井去了解情况，分析原因和采取必要的措施。莫斯科、基辅、斯维德洛夫斯克、列宁格勒等地国民经济委员会特别注意实现群众在全民讨论期间所提的建议。斯维德洛夫斯克国民经济委员会着手把以前属于不同部门的一些性质相同的企业合并起来，如把在苏霍伊·洛格的水泥厂和石板厂合并，同时研究充分利用铜矿、铜锌矿等地方原料。还有许多国民经济委员会一开始就注意在经济区之间建立良好的相互关系，彼此及时供应订货的问题。例如阿尔泰拖拉机工厂打算生产一种拖拉机，但是迟迟没有收到必需的车床。阿尔泰国民经济委员会向莫斯科（市）国民经济委员会询问，并迅速得到了答复。二十八台车床将在7月中运到阿尔泰去。
    各个国民经济委员会和国家计划委员会保持着密切的联系。改组后的苏联国家计划委员会依靠加盟共和国的国家计划委员会和国民经济委员会进行工作。苏联国家计委将派人下去和后者一起检查国民经济计划的执行情况，共和国的国家计委将向苏联国家计委汇报各经济区生产情况和提出建议。在编制经济区国民经济发展计划时，苏联国家计委将给国民经济委员会援助。将来苏联国民经济计划的编制工作，将直接从企业、工地和国民经济委员会开始，吸引广大群众参加。为了适应新的条件，前归中央工业和建设部门掌握的所有物资供给站将移交给国民经济委员会。在国民经济委员会内将成立统一的供销机构，以保证把物资及时供给本区内部和外区的企业和工地，使生产和建设按计划不间断地进行。
