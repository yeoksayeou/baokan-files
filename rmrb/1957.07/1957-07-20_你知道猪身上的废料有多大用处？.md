Pork can be eaten, pigskin can be used to make shoes and suitcases, everyone knows this. However, who knows how useful the things on a pig that people consider waste, such as pig nipples and pig hoof shells, can be?

Let me tell you: the pituitary gland of a pig can be used to make hormones, which are the raw materials for manufacturing special effects drugs for rheumatism. Pig nipples can be used to make pig nipple glue, which is a raw material for the photography, medicine, and paint industries. Pig hoof shells can be used to make pig hoof shell glue, which is a raw material for industries such as matches. The pig's stomach can be used to make pepsin, which is a digestive aid. Pig spinal cord and brain can be used to produce cholesterol, which is a raw material for manufacturing vitamin D. Pig gallbladders can be used to make pig bile ointment, which is a raw material for bile salts and bile acids in medicine. Pig spleen can be used to make spleen powder, which has special effects on high fever after surgery.

It doesn't take much investment to utilize these waste materials. For example, the pig's pituitary gland can be removed with a small hook. Every kilogram of pig pituitary gland is worth 465 yuan. Bile salts made from bile ointment are worth more than 100 yuan per catty.

In the Soviet Union, these pig offal have long been utilized, and their value is greater than that of pork. At present, large slaughterhouses in our country have begun to study their utilization. The Shanghai Frozen Meat Factory uses these waste products to make 31 kinds of medical supplies. If every slaughterhouse pays attention to utilization, it will increase a lot of income for the country.

    你知道猪身上的废料有多大用处？
    猪肉可以吃，猪皮可以做鞋，做皮箱，这是谁都知道的。然而，猪身上的那些被人们当成废物的东西，如猪奶头、猪蹄壳等等，谁能知道有多大用处呢？
    让我来告诉你：猪的脑下垂体可以做荷尔蒙，这是制造风湿特效药的原料。猪奶头可以做猪奶头胶，是照像、医药、油漆等行业的原料。猪蹄壳可以做猪蹄壳胶，是火柴等工业的原料。猪肚子可以做胃蛋白酶，是一种助消化的药剂。猪脊髓和大脑，可以制胆固醇，是制造卫生素丁的原料。猪苦胆可以制猪胆汁膏，是医药上胆盐、胆酸的原料。猪脾脏可以制脏粉，对手术后发高热有特殊疗效。
    利用这些废料，用不着多大投资。如猪脑下垂体，只要用一个小钩，就可以把它取出来。每一公斤猪脑下垂体，价值四百六十五元。用胆汁膏做出来的胆盐，每一斤价值一百多元。
    在苏联，这些猪身上的废品早已被利用，它的价值比猪肉还大。目前，我国的大屠宰厂已经开始研究利用。上海冻肉厂用这些废品制成三十一种医药用品。如果每一个屠宰厂都能注意利用，将给国家增加不少的收入。
