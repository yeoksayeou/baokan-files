Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 29th: Farmers in drought-stricken areas of Jiangxi Province are receiving batches of water pumps thanks to the efforts of over 3,000 workers in various machinery manufacturing factories. According to statistics, 685 water pumps have been transported to rural areas this year.

Currently, Jiangxi Province has 1,364 water pumps operating day and night to irrigate fields, ensuring the irrigation of over 500,000 mu of paddy fields. In Yanghu Township, Qingjiang County, 900 mu of paddy fields were on the verge of dying due to drought, but were completely saved after a new water pump was delivered. This county is operating 24 water pumps, and in just a few days, they saved 4,200 mu of drought-stricken seedlings. After 47 water pumps were delivered to the heavily drought-stricken Ji'an Prefecture on July 19th, over 20,000 mu of paddy fields were relieved from the threat of drought.

Jiangxi Province has many lakes and rivers and abundant water resources, but some areas are still prone to drought due to the lack of water conservancy facilities. This year, machinery manufacturing factories throughout the province plan to supply agricultural cooperatives with 8,000 to 10,000 horsepower of water pumps.

    工人送来抽水机
    据新华社南昌29日电　江西省受旱地区农民，在各机械制造工厂三千多名工人的努力下，正陆续得到一批批抽水机的支援。据统计，今年运到农村中的抽水机已有六百八十五台。
    现在，江西省有一千三百六十四台抽水机，日夜开动抽水灌田，保证了五十多万亩稻田的灌溉。清江县洋湖乡有九百亩稻田眼看就要旱死，运到一台新抽水机后全部救活了。这个县开动着二十四台抽水机，在几天内挽救了四千二百亩受旱的禾苗。受旱较重的吉安专区在7月19日运到四十七台抽水机后，有两万多亩稻田解除了干旱威胁。
    江西省境内湖泊、河流较多，水源充足，但有的地区因缺少水利设施，还容易受到干旱。今年全省各机械制造工厂计划供给农业社八千到一万马力抽水机。
