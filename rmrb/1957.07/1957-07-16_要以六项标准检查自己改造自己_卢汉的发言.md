I have listened to Premier Zhou Enlai’s Government Work Report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, Secretary-General Peng Zhen, President Dong Biwu, Chief Procurator Zhang Dingcheng, and other leaders, and I have studied these documents. I completely agree and enthusiastically support them! For me personally, this has not only been a comprehensive understanding of the tremendous achievements of the government's work over the past eight years, especially the past year, and the direction of future efforts, but also a concrete and vivid socialist ideological education.

Facts prove that our country has achieved unprecedented victories in socialist transformation and socialist construction, completing the Three Major Transformations through the Five Great Movements. Accompanied by the arrival of the transformation high tide, our country's socialist construction has experienced a leap forward in this year. The scale and speed of development in economic and cultural and educational undertakings have greatly exceeded the first three years of the Five-Year Plan, and some have even exceeded the sum of the growth of the first three years. With the rapid recovery and development of production, people's lives have also been significantly improved and raised.

Of course, on the road forward, some individual deviations and shortcomings will inevitably appear, but we should affirm that the achievements are the main aspect. The Party and the government have a hundredfold confidence and strength to gradually overcome these deviations and shortcomings.

In order to accelerate socialist construction and lead state affairs in a better and healthier direction, the Party has proactively launched a large-scale rectification movement, listening to the opinions of the masses and overcoming the "Three Evils." This is a very wise measure. It is beneficial to correctly handling contradictions among the people and the future of socialism. We should help the Party in its rectification by putting forward criticisms and suggestions with sincerity and honesty, based on "saying all you know and saying it without reservation" and "seeking truth from facts." However, at the beginning of this rectification movement, the reactionary words and deeds of the bourgeoisie were prominently expressed. They denied achievements and exaggerated shortcomings. They even had programs, organizations, and alliances, and frantically opposed the socialist system, opposed the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, undermined Sino-Soviet friendship and the international solidarity of socialism, attempting to drag the country back to the decadent and backward capitalist road, and fundamentally shake the people's democratic dictatorship.

These right-wing elements are rampantly attacking the Party and the government. In Premier Zhou's report, these slanders and fallacies were exposed and refuted one by one, revealing their tricks and brightening our eyes. We should be able to distinguish right from wrong and stand firm in these issues, and we should launch an irreconcilable struggle against these right-wing elements. At the same time, I myself must use the six political criteria proclaimed by Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou’s Government Work Report to examine myself, demand of myself, and draw a clear line between myself and the right-wing elements politically and ideologically. I wholeheartedly and sincerely support the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely and unswervingly take the road of socialism, remold myself, and actively contribute my strength.

In the first half of the year, I went to Yunnan Province for more than a month of inspection work and gained a rough understanding of the situation in some areas. In addition to the report submitted by the entire group to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, I would now like to put forward some suggestions to the congress based on the issues I personally saw:

First is the issue of education in Yunnan. In the past, Yunnan Province was located in a remote area with inconvenient transportation and a poor population, so education was relatively backward until liberation. After reform and adjustment after liberation, although there has been great progress, the quality is still not high compared to other provinces and regions in the country. There are two aspects to this problem: on the one hand, there are not many schools. For example, there are only Yunnan University, Teachers College, Institute of Technology, and Medical College among the institutions of higher learning. The facilities in primary and secondary schools are also not perfect, and there is a great shortage of teachers. There is insufficient care for the lives of professors, and there are also problems with scientific research and work arrangements, which make some professors unwilling to work in Yunnan and not very at ease. Second, there is the issue of student quality. Because Yunnan students have a very poor foundation, their grades are generally lower than those of students from the interior. For example, in the Yunnan University entrance examinations, there are fewer Yunnan students and more students from other provinces. I suggest that the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Higher Education should attach importance to education in remote areas, especially teacher education. Improve the quality of education in primary and secondary schools, so that young people in border areas can gradually catch up with other provinces and regions in culture, and change the backward state of education in remote areas of Yunnan as soon as possible.

Secondly, there is the work of the CPPCC in Yunnan Province. Yunnan was liberated relatively late, and the ethnic and class relations are more complex. Therefore, united front work is the most important. The work of the CPPCC within Yunnan Province has been successful in recent years. However, in order to better handle social and ethnic relations and achieve greater unity, it should be strengthened and given further importance. It can assist the government in implementing policies and laws, and it will fully play its role as an assistant in mobilizing all positive factors for socialist construction. Therefore, I suggest that political consultative conference organizations be established in appropriate cities and counties in Yunnan Province to widely absorb people from all walks of life to participate, so that they can better assist the Party and the government in handling all specific work.

Finally, there is the issue of the uprising personnel in Yunnan. Most of the uprising personnel in Yunnan have been properly arranged by the government, but some have not yet been assigned work and are experiencing financial difficulties. During my inspection, they hoped that I would convey this on their behalf. I request the government to provide them with appropriate care. Also, for some uprising personnel who have been detained and undergoing labor reform due to unclear historical accounts or other reasons, may I ask the government to investigate the situation, distinguish between the severity of the cases, and deal with them as soon as possible.

The above three points are my suggestions and also my requests. Please consider them!

Finally, I wish the congress a complete success, and I wish all the representatives good health!

    要以六项标准检查自己改造自己
    卢汉的发言
    我听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李先念、薄一波副总理，彭真秘书长，董必武院长，张鼎丞检察长，各位首长的报告，又学习了这些文件，我完全同意，热烈拥护！在我个人不止是全面的了解八年来，特别是去年一年来政府工作的巨大成就和今后努力的方向，而且具体生动的受到了一次社会主义的思想教育。
    事实证明，我国在社会主义改造和社会主义建设当中，取得了史无前例的胜利，通过五大运动，完成三大改造。伴随着改造高潮的到来，在这一年内，我国社会主义建设有了一个飞跃的发展，经济事业和文教事业的发展规模和速度，都大大地超过了五年计划的前三年，有些甚至超过前三年增长的总和。随着生产的迅速恢复和发展，人民生活也得到显著的改善与提高。
    当然，在前进的道路上，不可避免的会出现一些个别的偏差和缺点，但我们应该肯定，成绩是主要的。党和政府有百倍的信心和力量来逐步克服这些偏差和缺点。
    党为了加速社会主义建设，把国家事务领导得更好、更健康，主动地展开了大规模的整风运动，倾听群众意见，克服“三害”，这是非常明智的措施。对正确处理人民内部矛盾和社会主义前途都是有利的。我们帮助党整风，应当本着“知无不言，言无不尽”“实事求是”诚心诚意的提出批评和建议。可是，就在这次整风运动初期，资产阶级的反动言行就突出的表现出来，他们否定成绩，夸大缺点，他们甚至有纲领、有组织、有联盟，丧心病狂的反对社会主义制度，反对中国共产党的领导，破坏中苏友谊与社会主义的国际团结，企图把国家倒拖向腐朽落后的资本主义道路，要想从根本上动摇人民民主专政制度。
    这些右派分子猖狂的在向党和政府进攻，在周总理的报告中，曾经逐一的揭露和驳斥了这些谰言谬论，揭露了他们的诡计，使我们擦亮了自己的眼睛。在这些问题上能够明辨是非，站稳立场，我们应该对这些右派分子展开不可调和的斗争。同时，我自己也要以毛主席所昭示的六项政治标准和周总理的政府工作报告来检查自己、要求自己，和右派分子在政治上和思想上划清界限。衷心诚意地拥护中国共产党，坚决不渝地走社会主义的道路。改造自己，并积极贡献自己的力量。
    我在上半年，曾经到云南省进行了一个多月的视察工作，粗略的了解了一些地方的情况，除了全组的报告已向人代常委会反映外，现在就我个人见到的几项问题，向大会提出建议：
    第一是关于云南的教育问题。云南省以往地处偏僻，交通不便，人民生活贫乏，所以教育方面，一直到解放以前都是比较落后的。解放后经过改革和调整，虽然有了很大的进步，但是比之国内其他省区，仍然质量不高，这是有两方面的问题：一方面是学校不多，如高等学校只有云南大学、师范学院、工学院、医学院，大中小学的设备也不够完善，师资非常缺乏。对教授们的生活照顾不够，科学研究和工作安排也有问题，以致使有些教授都不想在云南工作下去，不十分安心。其次是学生的质量问题，云南学生由于基础很差，成绩一般比内地学生低，如像云大招考，云南学生较少，外籍学生较多。我建议教育部和高教部应当重视边远地区的教育工作，特别是师范教育。提高中小学的教育质量，使边疆青年在文化上能够与其他省区逐渐看齐，早日改变云南边远地区教育方面的落后状态。
    其次是云南省的政协工作。云南解放较晚，民族和阶级关系较为复杂。因此，统一战线工作是最重要的。云南省区内的政协工作，几年以来是做得有成绩的。但为使社会关系和民族关系处理得更好，更加团结，应该加强和进一步重视起来，它可以协助政府推行政策法令，在调动一切积极因素为社会主义建设方面，会充分发挥它助手的作用的。所以我建议在云南省可否在适当的市县建立政治协商会议的组织，广泛吸收社会人士参加，使他们能够更好的协助党和政府处理一切具体的工作。
    最后一点是云南起义人员的问题。云南的起义人员大部分已经得到政府的适当安排，但有个别还没有分配工作，生活困难，我在视察时，他们希望我代为反映。我请求政府对他们予以适当的照顾。还有个别起义人员，因历史交代不清或其他原因被拘押劳改的，可否请政府查明情况，分别轻重早日予以处理。
    以上三点是我的建议，也是我的请求，请予考虑！
    末了，敬祝大会圆满成功，并颂各位代表先生们的身体健康！
