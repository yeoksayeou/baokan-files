Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd -- Polish Ambassador to China, Kiriloek, held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight to celebrate the National Day of the Polish People's Republic.

    Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception.

    At the reception, Vice Chairman Zhu De, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, warmly congratulated Poland on its National Day. He said that for thirteen years, the liberated Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish People's Government, have steadfastly embarked on the glorious road of socialist construction and have already achieved significant successes in the cause of socialist construction. At the same time, with the forward development of Poland's socialist cause, the international status of the Polish People's Republic is also constantly rising. It is playing an increasingly important role in safeguarding peace in Europe and the world. The Chinese people have always regarded every achievement of the Polish people as their own victory and are sincerely encouraged by it.

    Vice Chairman Zhu De said that the ever-strengthening and developing friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Polish peoples is not only entirely in line with the interests of the two peoples, but also helps to further strengthen the close unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and safeguard the noble cause of world peace.

    Vice Chairman Zhu De concluded by proposing a toast to the unbreakable, brotherly friendship between China and Poland, to the increasing prosperity and strength of the Polish People's Republic, to the strong unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, to world peace, and to the health of Comrade Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish Council of State.

    At the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai proposed a toast to the unbreakable friendship between China and Poland, to the solidarity of the socialist camp, to world peace, and to the health of Comrade Gomulka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and Comrade Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland; and also to the health of Ambassador Kiriloek and his wife.

    At the beginning of the reception, Ambassador Kiriloek delivered a speech. He said that the tremendous development of our country's industry, culture and science, the improvement of the people's living standards, health, and education levels are undeniable achievements of the past years. However, in addition to achievements, we have also had shortcomings and deviations. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Plenary Sessions of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party corrected these deviations. The Party resolutely opposed dogmatism and bureaucracy and led the struggle and construction.

    Kiriloek said that we base our cooperation with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries on fraternal friendship and mutual assistance, on equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

    Thanks to these reforms, the Polish United Workers' Party has strengthened its cooperation with other democratic parties in Poland, and mobilized Polish workers, peasants, and intellectuals to unite under the Party's program. The Polish people support this policy.

    Kiriloek said that during this period of great change for our people, the ties of friendship and brotherly cooperation between the Chinese and Polish peoples have been further strengthened. Comrade Gomulka emphasized the great significance of Comrade Mao Zedong's theoretical works for the development of socialism at the Ninth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, while the visits of Comrade Premier Zhou Enlai and many other Chinese delegations to Poland are proof of the warm feelings held by all circles of our society for the great Chinese people.

    The government of the Polish People's Republic is strengthening and will continue to strengthen its fraternal friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other People's Democratic countries. Our government is willing to coexist with all countries in the world in a spirit of full friendship and mutual benefit, and to prove this by establishing political, economic, and cultural cooperation with all countries.

    Kiriloek concluded by proposing a toast to the happiness and prosperity of the great Chinese people, to the further achievements of the Communist Party of China, to Sino-Polish friendship and further cooperation, and to the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China. Ambassador Kiriloek also proposed a toast to the health of Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai, who attended the reception.

    Among the more than 800 people attending the reception were also Vice Premiers Chen Yun, He Long, and Bo Yibo, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and Chen Shutong, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian, and people from all walks of life in China. Ambassadors and diplomatic officials from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    波兰大使举行国庆招待会
    朱德副主席和周恩来总理到会祝贺
    据新华社22日讯　波兰驻华大使基里洛克今晚在北京饭店举行盛大招待会，庆祝波兰人民共和国国庆。
    朱德副主席和周恩来总理出席了招待会。
    在招待会上，朱德副主席代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民热烈祝贺波兰国庆日。他说，十三年来，解放了的波兰人民在波兰统一工人党和波兰人民政府的领导下，坚定地走上了社会主义建设的光辉道路，并且已经在社会主义建设事业中取得了重大的成就。同时，随着波兰社会主义事业的向前发展，波兰人民共和国的国际地位也在不断地提高。它在维护欧洲和世界和平的事业中起着日益重要的作用。中国人民一向把波兰人民的每一个成就都看为自己的胜利，并且由衷地感到欢欣鼓舞。
    朱德副主席说，中波两国人民的友好合作关系的日益加强和发展不仅完全符合两国人民的利益，同时也有助于进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的紧密团结和维护世界和平的崇高事业。
    朱德副主席最后提议为中波两国兄弟般的牢不可破的友谊，为波兰人民共和国的日益繁荣和富强，为以苏联为首的社会主义各国的坚强团结，为世界和平，为波兰国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基同志的健康干杯。
    周恩来总理在招待会上提议为中波两国间的牢不可破的友谊，为社会主义阵营的团结，为世界和平，为波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡同志和波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志的健康干杯；同时为基里洛克大使和夫人健康干杯。
    在招待会开始的时候，基里洛克大使讲了话。他说，我们国家的工业化、文化和科学的巨大发展，人民生活、卫生、教育水平的提高，这是过去年代中无可辩驳的成就。但是，除开成就之外，我们也曾有过缺点和偏向。波兰统一工人党中央第七次、第八次和第九次全体会议纠正了这些偏向，党坚决反对教条主义和官僚主义，领导了斗争和建设。
    基里洛克说，我们把和苏联以及人民民主国家的合作，建立在兄弟般的友谊和互助的基础上，建立在平等、互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的基础上。
    由于这种种改革，波兰统一工人党加强了它与波兰其他民主党派的合作，动员了波兰工人、农民和劳动知识分子团结在党的纲领之下。波兰人民支持这一政策。
    基里洛克说，在我国人民这些伟大改变的时期，波中两国人民的友谊和兄弟般合作的联系进一步加强了。哥穆尔卡同志在波兰统一工人党九中全会上着重指出了毛泽东同志理论著作对于发展社会主义的重大意义，而周恩来总理同志和其他许多中国代表团访问波兰的情形，则是我国社会各界对伟大中国人民所怀抱的热烈感情的证明。
    波兰人民共和国政府正在并将继续加强和苏联、中华人民共和国和其他一切人民民主国家的兄弟友谊和合作。我国政府愿意根据充分的友谊和互利的精神和全世界一切国家共同相处，并在与各国建立政治、经济和文化合作来证明这一点。
    基里洛克最后提议，为伟大的中国人民幸福和繁荣，为中国共产党获得进一步的成就，为波中友谊和进一步的合作，为中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志的健康干杯。基里洛克大使还提议为出席招待会的朱德副主席和周恩来总理的健康干杯。
    出席招待会的八百多人中，还有副总理陈云、贺龙、薄一波，副委员长李济深、沈钧儒、陈叔通，最高人民法院院长董必武，外交部副部长张闻天及中国各方面人士。各国驻华使节和外交官员也出席了招待会。
