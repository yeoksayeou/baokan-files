Chu Anping Was a Rightist Even During the Democratic Revolution
Lǐ Bīng
During this rectification movement, Mr. Chu Anping made the fallacious argument that "the Party-dominated world view is the root of all sectarianism," challenging the leadership of the proletariat party. This is by no means accidental. It has its social, historical, and ideological roots. At the same time, this incident also shows us that a bourgeois kingdom is still firmly preserved in the depths of Mr. Chu Anping's mind, and capitalist "democracy and liberalism" still linger in the minds of some intellectuals.

Intellectuals around the age of thirty all know that Chu Anping became famous during the Third Domestic Revolutionary Period (the Liberation War) as the editor-in-chief of the *Observation* magazine, which claimed to be "independent, objective, and non-partisan." Although *Observation* magazine explicitly stipulated that authors were responsible for their own articles, and the editors did not necessarily agree with the articles published, on the whole, the tendency of these articles (especially Chu Anping's own articles) essentially represented the so-called "liberal road," the so-called "middle route" at that time. In 1947, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "Among the upper petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, a small number of people, namely the right-wing elements of these classes, have reactionary political tendencies. They spread illusions for American imperialism and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique, and they oppose the people's democratic revolution." And the "liberal road," "third road," and "middle route" at that time were reflections of this reactionary political tendency on the ideological front.

I do not want to underestimate the role of *Observation* magazine in exposing and criticizing the Kuomintang reactionaries' corrupt and dark rule. However, as rightists during the democratic revolution, they also spread many adverse reactionary influences, hindering the improvement of the people's awareness. Many intellectuals hesitated under their influence and could not embark on the road of revolution early on.

At that time, Mr. Chu Anping and *Observation* magazine adopted a bourgeois nationalist position in international relations, failing to distinguish between friends and enemies, and often compared the Soviet Union with the American imperialism, which the people deeply hated, and even spread anti-Soviet fallacies. For example, Chu Anping once publicly supported the proposal put forward by Yang Guangshi and others to organize a "Democratic International" to counter the victory of international communism around the world. At that time, Chu Anping studied the views of Yang Guangshi and others with Wu Shichang. Wu Shichang wrote in "On the Democratic International": "Mr. Chu Anping, the editor of this journal, gave me the opportunity to read this article (referring to the article by Yang Guangshi and others) before it was published. We all believe that some of the views put forward in this article have never been said by anyone at home or abroad, and are of great constructive value... Generally speaking, it is acceptable." (See Wu Shichang, "On the Democratic International," *Observation*, Vol. 2, No. 22)

Domestically, the Chinese people and the counter-revolutionaries were in a life-and-death struggle. In the midst of the revolutionary storm, Mr. Chu Anping tried his best to spread the poison of reformism, touting the so-called liberal road outside the revolution. Originally, reformism, especially social democracy, did not have a broad class basis in semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. The three major enemies politically implemented extremely vicious rule, not giving the people any democratic rights; economically, they carried out exploitation that sucked the marrow from the bones, not only making it impossible for the working class and the peasant class to survive, but even placing the national bourgeoisie in a precarious position. Therefore, the Chinese people had no way out except to carry out revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party. However, Mr. Chu Anping, when the reactionaries were already at the end of their rope and the revolution was already in sight of victory, used *Observation* and some of his own works (such as *British Sketches*) to theoretically promote the superiority of capitalist democracy and the good governance of the British Labour Party. Under his skillful pen, hypocrisy and deception became honesty and justice, depicting the rule of the worker aristocracy in imperialist countries, built on the blood and sweat of the people of colonies and semi-colonies, as a beautiful and moving picture, saying that it was the most ideal road that the Chinese people should follow.

Although Mr. Chu Anping often criticized the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries with enthusiasm, as a reformist, he was inevitably sentimental and had an unbreakable bond with the reactionary regime in his thoughts and feelings. Therefore, after criticizing the Kuomintang, he often revealed the face of a strategist, offering suggestions for the Kuomintang. For example, during the "May 20th" student movement in 1947, Mr. Chu Anping said in his article "The Fluctuating Situation and the Raging Student Movement" that "the ruling authorities must come up with conscience and methods, and implement them one by one. What China needs most urgently today is that the ruling authorities can sacrifice some of the rights they have already obtained. Only in this way can people's hearts be calmed and society stabilized!"

As a reformist and bourgeois democrat, in essence, he inevitably clashed with communism and the people's revolution. Therefore, Mr. Chu Anping at that time expressed the same, or even greater, aversion to the Chinese people's hope—the Chinese Communist Party and the people's revolution—as he did to the Kuomintang. He said: "To be honest, we are now striving for freedom. Under the rule of the Kuomintang, this 'freedom' is still a question of 'more' or 'less'. If the Communist Party is in power, this 'freedom' will become a question of 'having' or 'not having'." "Frankly speaking, today the Communist Party is singing loudly about 'democracy'. It should be known that the Communist Party is essentially an anti-democratic party. In terms of the spirit of rule, there is no difference between the Communist Party and the Fascist Party. Both try to force the people's will through strict organization. In today's Chinese political struggle, the Communist Party shouts 'democracy' only to encourage everyone to rise up against the Kuomintang's 'Party dominance', but in terms of the Communist Party's true spirit, what the Communist Party advocates is also 'Party dominance' and not 'democracy'." (Chu Anping, "The Political Situation in China," *Observation*, Vol. 2, No. 2, 1947) If we compare these slanders with Mr. Chu Anping's so-called "Party-dominated world" argument and his opposition to the dictatorship of the proletariat today, although ten years have passed, it is not difficult for us to find clues that are consistent from beginning to end.

In 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries and the old society were already on the verge of disintegration. Even Mr. Chu Anping saw that "the people's hearts are scattered, the economy is collapsing, and there is no certainty in the military. Nanjing has clearly fallen into darkness and pain." "According to our observation, the current regime has lost the power to reverse this decline, and recently it has lost the confidence to reverse this decline." However, Chu Anping dared to arrogantly seize the leadership of the democratic revolutionary movement and obstruct the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. He proposed in his article "The Political Situation in China": "If viewed from the perspective of morality and thought, then what can shake the Kuomintang regime today is not the Communist Party but this group of free-thinking elements... Conversely, what can resist the Communist Party today is not the Kuomintang, but this group of free-thinking elements... Under this trend of two extremes, only free-thinking elements can come out to lead, can obtain a moderate stability, and can win the heartfelt support of the broad masses of the people... Today, the vast majority of people are neither satisfied with the Kuomintang nor necessarily welcome the Communist Party. The vast majority of people hope that a new force can emerge outside the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to stabilize the political situation in China today... Free-thinking elements can rise up, should rise up." In this article, Chu Anping at that time also analyzed the so-called "free-thinking elements outside the Kuomintang and the Communist Party," believing that the larger organization of free-thinking elements was the Democratic League. He believed that the Democratic League was an organization that was "congenitally deficient and acquired maladjustment." He believed that among the leading figures of the Democratic League, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei and others were all figures of the past, and only Luo Longji was good at both Chinese and English, and had good eloquence and writing skills, and had both motivation and original power, and was truly interested in political life. Therefore, although "Luo's greatest weakness is that his virtue is not commensurate with his talent, but "if judged by modern standards, strictly speaking, among the leading figures of the Democratic League today, perhaps only Mr. Luo Nusheng (Longji) is suitable for actual political life." (Chu Anping, "The Political Situation in China," *Observation*, Vol. 2, No. 2) If we compare these remarks with the fallacies of Chu Anping and other right-wing elements today, such as "the Communist Party should step down" and "the democratic parties should take turns in power," we can more deeply understand the essence of the right-wing elements and the true face of the right-wing elements. But unfortunately, the mantis cannot stop the chariot after all. Not only did American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, but even the "liberal elements" and "middle route" represented by Mr. Chu Anping fail to reverse the wheels of history! In 1949, the rule of the three major enemies in China was completely destroyed. On the eve of the national liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries sealed up *Observation* magazine, and Mr. Chu Anping was helplessly "forced to join the Liangshan Mountain"—participating in the revolution.

Despite the fact that Mr. Chu Anping spread so many reactionary remarks during the Liberation War, the Party and the people still treated these issues with historical materialism after liberation, and did not criticize him harshly. And he was given appropriate arrangements in terms of work and status. He was elected as a National People's Congress representative, and he was appointed as the editor-in-chief of *Guangming Daily*, an important position. As a reader of *Observation*, I also saw with great joy that Mr. Chu Anping made self-criticism in *Observation* magazine, which was published in November 1949 after liberation, and was able to initially recognize his mistakes. Later, I also saw in the People's Daily that Chu Anping stayed in Xinjiang and wrote some reports praising the heroic Chinese people's great achievements under the leadership of the Communist Party. How sincerely I hoped that he could thoroughly transform himself and advance together with the people. But in no time at all, Mr. Chu Anping revealed his tail, slandered and defamed the Communist Party again, and arrogantly tried to seize the leadership of the working class. But times have changed. In the face of the strong dictatorship of the proletariat and the consolidated alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, Mr. Chu Anping's attempt to peddle bourgeois private goods has been discovered, and "democratic liberalism" no longer has a broad market. But this incident also illustrates a truth to us: "For many intellectuals who have received bourgeois education and are influenced by bourgeois ideas in various ways, accepting socialism is not an easy task." The transformation of intellectuals also requires a thorough change. Without thoroughly transforming oneself, one will "sooner or later be thrown off the train of the times"! At this point, I cannot help but repeatedly chew on Fuchik's famous saying: "People, I love you, you must be vigilant."

    储安平在民主革命时期就是右派
    李兵
    在这次整风运动中，储安平先生发表了所谓“党天下思想是一切宗派主义的根源”的谬论，向无产阶级政党的领导权提出挑战，这绝不是偶然的。这有他的社会的历史的思想的根源。同时这件事也向我们表明了在储安平先生的思想深处仍然牢固地保存着一个资产阶级的王国，资本主义的“民主自由主义”仍然在一些知识分子心目中阴魂不散。
    三十岁左右的知识分子，大都知道储安平是在第三次国内革命时期（解放战争时期）以主编标榜为“独立的、客观的、超党派的”观察杂志而知名于世的。虽然观察杂志明文规定文责自负，它所刊载的论文编者并不一定同意，但是整个的说，这些论文的倾向（特别是储安平自己的论文），实质上是代表当时所谓“自由主义的道路”，所谓“中间路线”的。1947年毛泽东同志在“目前形势和我们的任务”中指出：“蒋介石统治区域的上层小资产阶级及中等资产阶级，其中有为数不多的一部分人，即这些阶级的右翼分子，存在着反动的政治倾向，他们替美国帝国主义与蒋介石反动集团散布幻想，他们反对人民民主革命。”而当时的“自由主义的道路”“第三条道路”“中间路线”就是这种反动政治倾向在思想战线上的反映。
    我不愿低估观察杂志在揭露和抨击国民党反动派腐朽透顶暗无天日的统治这一方面的作用。但是作为民主革命时期的右派，他们也散布了许多恶劣的反动的影响，阻碍了人民群众觉悟的提高。许多知识分子在他们的影响下踌躇徘徊，不能早日地走上革命的道路。
    当时的储安平先生和观察杂志在国际关系上采取了资产阶级民族主义立场，敌友不分，经常将苏联与人民所深恶痛绝的美帝国主义相提并论，甚至散布反苏滥调。例如储安平曾经公开地支持杨光时等十人提出的组织“民主国际”用以对抗国际共产主义在全世界取得胜利的建议。当时储安平曾同吴世昌一起研究了杨光时等人的见解。吴世昌在“论民主国际”一文中写道：“本刊的编者储安平先生使我在此文（指杨光时等十人的文章）未发表前有读到的机会。我们都认为这一篇文章中所提的若干见解，不论在国内或国外都是从未经人说过，且极有建设性的价值……大体上可以令人同意。”（见观察2卷22期吴世昌：论民主国际）
    在国内，中国人民与反革命正处在生死决斗时期，在漫天的革命大风暴中，储安平先生尽力散播改良主义的毒素，标榜出所谓革命以外的自由主义的道路。本来，改良主义特别是社会民主主义在半封建半殖民地的旧中国没有广泛的阶级基础。三大敌人在政治上是穷凶极恶的统治，不给人民以任何民主权利；经济上是敲骨吸髓的剥削，不仅使工人阶级农民阶级活不下去，甚至民族资产阶级都处在复巢之下，岌岌可危。因此中国人民除了在共产党领导之下进行革命以外，别无出路。但是储安平先生却在反动派已日暮途穷，革命已经胜利在望之际，通过观察和自己的一些著作（如英国采风录）在理论上大肆宣传资本主义民主的优越和英国工党的德政。在他的生花妙笔之下，虚伪与欺骗变成了诚实和公正，把建筑在殖民地半殖民地人民血汗上的帝国主义国家的工人贵族的统治描绘成一幅绮丽动人的图画，说成是中国人民应当遵循的最理想的道路。
    虽然储安平先生也经常激昂慷慨地抨击国民党反动派的统治，但是作为一个改良主义者在思想感情上对反动政权必然是情意绵绵藕断丝连的。因此往往在抨击了国民党之后又显露出策士的面孔，为国民党借著一筹。例如1947年“五·二○”学生运动中，储安平先生在“大局浮动、学潮如火”一文中最后就说什么“要执政当局拿出良心和办法来，一一见之实行。今日中国最迫切需要者，实莫过于执政当局能够牺牲他们已得的一部分权利，唯有这样，人心才能平，社会才得安定！”
    作为一个改良主义者和资产阶级民主主义者，在思想本质上必然是同共产主义和人民革命相抵触的。因此储安平先生当时对于中国人民的希望——中国共产党和人民革命，像对国民党一样表示了同样的甚至更大的厌恶。他说：“老实说，我们现在争取自由，在国民党统治下，这个‘自由’还是一个‘多’‘少’的问题，假如共产党执政了，这个‘自由’就变成了一个‘有’‘无’的问题了。”“坦白言之，今日共产党大唱其‘民主’，要知共产党在基本精神上实在是一个反民主的政党。就统治精神上说，共产党和法西斯党本无任何区别，两者都企图透过严厉的组织以强制人民的意志。在今日的中国的政争中，共产党高喊‘民主’无非要鼓励大家起来反对国民党的‘党主’，但就共产党的真精神言，共产党所主张的也是‘党主’而决非‘民主’。”（储安平：中国的政局，1947年观察二卷二期）如果把这些诬蔑言论与今天储安平先生所谓“党天下”论调，反对无产阶级专政的论调相比，虽然隔了十年，我们不难发现蛛丝马迹，前后是一脉相承的。
    1947年国民党反动派和旧社会已经在分崩离析的前夕，连储安平先生也看出“民心的涣散，经济的崩溃，军事上的没有把握。南京显已沦入暗淡与苦痛之中。”“据我们观察现政权已失挽回这个颓局的力量，最近且已失去挽回这个颓势的自信心。”但是储安平竟敢狂妄地要争取民主革命运动的领导权，阻挠中国人民革命的胜利。他在中国的政局一文中提出：“若从道德及思想的角度看，则今天能动摇国民党政权的不是共产党而是这一批自由思想分子……反过来说。今天能抗拒共产党的，也不是国民党，而是这批自由思想分子……在这种两趋极端之下，只有自由分子出来领导，可以获得一个中庸的稳定，获得广大人民的衷心附和……今日绝大多数的人，既不满意国，也未必欢迎共。绝大数的人都希望国共之外能产生一种新的力量，以稳定今日中国的政局。……自由思想分子可以起来，应该起来。”在这篇文章中，储安平当时还分析了所谓“国共两党以外的自由思想分子”，认为自由思想分子的组织，较大的就是民盟。他认为民盟是一个“先天不足，后天失调”的组织。他认为民盟的领导人物中沈钧儒、黄炎培等人都是过去的人物，只有罗隆基一人中文英文都好，口才文章都来，有煽动力，有原动力，而且对于政治生活真正有兴趣”，因而，虽则“罗氏的最大弱点是德不济才，但是“若以现代的标准言之，严格说来，在今日民盟的领导人物中适宜于实际政治生活者，恐怕只有罗努生（隆基）先生一人”。（储安平：中国的政局载观察二卷二期）如果把这些言论和今日储安平及其他一些右派分子的“要共产党下台”“民主党派轮流执政”等向共产党争取领导权的谬论加以印证，我们才能更深刻地认识到右派分子的本质，右派分子的真正面目。但是很遗憾，螳臂毕竟不能当车，不仅美帝国主义和国民党反动派，就连储安平先生所代表的“自由主义分子”“中间路线”都没有扭转历史的车轮！1949年三大敌人在中国的统治完全复灭了。而在全国即将解放的前夕，国民党反动派查封了观察杂志，储安平先生才无可奈何地被“逼上梁山”——参加了革命。
    尽管储安平先生在解放战争时期散布了这么多的反动言论，但是解放后党和人民仍然历史唯物地对待这些问题，并没有对他有所苛责。并且在工作上地位上予以适当安排。选他作全国人民代表，使他担任了光明日报总编辑这个重要职务。作为一个观察的读者，我也曾以极其欣慰的心情，看到了储安平先生在1949年11月解放后出版的观察杂志上进行了自我批评，能初步认识自己的错误。后来又从人民日报上看到储安平留居新疆，写出了些歌颂英雄的中国人民在共产党领导下所建立的丰功伟绩的报道。我多么衷心地希望他能够彻底地改造自己与人民共同前进。但是曾几何时，储安平先生竟露出了尾巴，又对共产党进行诽谤诬蔑，又狂妄地要夺取工人阶级的领导权了。但是时代变了，在强大的无产阶级专政和巩固的工农与知识分子联盟面前，储安平先生企图贩卖资产阶级私货的企图被查获了，“民主自由主义”现在已经没有广泛的市场。但是这件事情也向我们说明了一个真理：“对于许多受过资产阶级教育、从各方面感染到资产阶级思想影响的知识分子，接受社会主义不是一件很容易的事”。知识分子的改造也同样需要脱胎换骨。不彻底地改造自己，“早晚会被抛出时代的列车”！至此我不禁一再咀嚼伏契克的名言“人们，我爱你们，你们要警惕呵”。
