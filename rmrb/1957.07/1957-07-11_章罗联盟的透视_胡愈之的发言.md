This session of the National People's Congress has exposed and criticized the absurd statements and heinous acts of the bourgeois right-wingers who are anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist. Because of the right-wingers' rampant attacks on the Party and socialism, a fierce struggle—the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads—is currently unfolding across the country. I agree with the speeches made by the delegates at the Congress and in the group meetings exposing, criticizing, and denouncing the right-wingers. I am willing to join the delegates, along with the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the country, in the anti-rightist struggle, and I will carry this fierce political and ideological struggle through to the end, not stopping until victory is achieved. As a member of the China Democratic League, I will now expose, analyze, and criticize the Zhang (Bojun)-Luo (Longji) alliance and their anti-communist, anti-socialist sinister plot at the Congress. I ask the delegates to jointly condemn and denounce them.

**The Zhang-Luo Alliance is a Sinister Clique Formed by Bourgeois Right-Wingers**

First, let's analyze the essence of the bourgeois right-wingers and the Zhang-Luo alliance.

In 1939, when the Chinese democratic revolution was underway, Chairman Mao Zedong already pointed out that the Chinese national bourgeoisie was a class with a dual character. "...In a certain period and to a certain extent, they can participate in the revolution against imperialism and the government of bureaucrats and warlords, and they can become a force of the revolution. But in another period, there is a danger of following behind the comprador big bourgeoisie as an accomplice of the counter-revolution."

After the national liberation, the Chinese revolution entered the stage of socialist revolution. By 1956, the socialist revolution had achieved a basic victory. During this period, because the Chinese Communist Party adopted a correct policy of unity and transformation towards the national bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie accepted the policy of redemption, handed over the means of production they occupied, and gradually accepted socialist transformation. A large part of the intellectuals among them accepted ideological remolding, and a small part changed their bourgeois worldview and began to transform into working intellectuals.

However, this is only one aspect.

On the other hand, as a whole class, the bourgeoisie is by no means willing to withdraw from the political stage. In the process of socialist revolution, a large part of the bourgeoisie, including their intellectuals, are still wavering between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. They have one side of accepting the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and another side of resisting the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party. This is the middle faction of the bourgeoisie. In addition, there is a small group of people who are bourgeois right-wingers. They are resolutely anti-communist and anti-socialist. They are scheming and waiting for an opportunity to seize the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship, and pull the People's Republic of China back to the reactionary road of capitalism.

The number of bourgeois right-wingers is very small, but because they are resolutely anti-communist and anti-socialist, and they can influence a large number of bourgeois middle factions, their harmfulness is very great. The Zhang (Bojun)-Luo (Longji) alliance is a sinister clique formed by these bourgeois right-wingers to oppose communism, oppose the people, and oppose socialism.

**The Anti-Communist Political Essence of Zhang and Luo**

What kind of people are Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji? Luo Longji said: "Even if my bones are burned to ashes, you won't find anything anti-communist or anti-socialist." This is completely wrong. It should be said like this: even if the bones of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji are burned to ashes, they are still anti-communist and anti-people, and you will definitely not smell a trace of socialism.

Zhang Bojun, born into a landlord family, joined the Chinese Communist Party while studying in Germany. After the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, he left the Communist Party and joined the Third Party—the predecessor of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. At that time, the Third Party called for China to take the third road, which was a middle line that was both anti-Chiang and anti-communist. From that time on, Zhang Bojun advocated the anti-communist theory of Kautsky of the Second International. Lenin once said: "Kautsky completely distorted the Marxist doctrine and counterfeited it into opportunism." He also said: "He recognizes revolution in words, but in fact, he betrays revolution." Therefore, Zhang Bojun inherited the mantle of the traitor Kautsky, distorted Marxism-Leninism, hung up the banner of revisionism, and peddled capitalist private goods. He has been consistent for thirty years.

Luo Longji graduated from Tsinghua University and studied political science at Columbia University in the United States. After returning to China, he became a pawn of Hu Shi and served as the editor-in-chief of *New Moon* magazine and the Catholic newspaper *Yi Shi Bao*. In October 1930, he wrote in *New Moon* magazine: "In the current situation in China, in order to seek a way out for the Chinese people, we can only hope that the Kuomintang's suppression of the Communists will succeed as soon as possible. As the saying goes, 'Choose the lesser of two evils,' that's what I mean." In December of the same year, he wrote in the article "To the Japanese People and the Chinese Authorities": "Now, there is such a voice in the Chinese youth: 'Rather return to Japan than be annexed by Russia.' The success of the Chinese Communists is a disaster for China and not a blessing for Japan. Russia is now taking the opportunity to rise. If China and Japan fight like snipes and clams, the Communists will benefit. Once the entire East Asia is red, there will be no intact eggs under the overturned nest! This is another point that Japanese knowledgeable and discerning people and politicians should consider."

Luo Longji once said: "Zhang Bojun is seven parts anti-Chiang and three parts anti-communist; I am six parts anti-Chiang and four parts anti-communist." Zhang Bojun also said: "The Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party started its career by opposing communism, while the Democratic League started its career by taking the middle road." Zhang and Luo have always played two-faced tricks, but these two sentences are relatively honest. It can be seen that Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji have been resolutely anti-communist bourgeois elements from the beginning of their political activities. During the democratic revolution period, especially from the later period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, both of them took the middle road of opposing Chiang and opposing communism at the same time. Birds of a feather flock together. From the perspective of their anti-communist political essence, the two of them are completely consistent. It is not accidental that Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji later formed an anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist alliance, because they already had a common class foundation and common ideological roots.

**After the End of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Zhang and Luo Tried Their Best to Lead the Democratic League to the Reactionary Third Road**

As representatives of the declining class, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji are completely the same. However, the classes they represent are still not completely the same. Zhang Bojun calls himself a street politician, that is, a rogue politician. He represents a group of social scum in the bourgeoisie with a strong feudal and comprador nature: old warlords, old bureaucrats, hooligans, local bullies, old intellectuals from landlord families, and those who have fallen behind in the revolutionary struggle. On the other hand, Luo Longji represents the bourgeois intellectuals, mainly students who have studied in Britain and the United States, some of whom have a certain position and reputation in the academic world. Some of them have made great progress in their thinking in recent years. But before they have undergone ideological transformation, they are branded with the bourgeois mark from head to toe. They dream of transforming Chinese society according to the capitalist model. The "democratic individualists" whom former US Secretary of State Acheson placed his hopes on refer to this group of untransformed bourgeois intellectuals represented by Luo Longji.

After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji were still dreaming of the middle road and wanted to lead the Democratic League to the reactionary third road. They never estimated the great strength of the Chinese people. They were convinced that the civil war would be prolonged indefinitely, and that "the Kuomintang cannot eliminate the Communist Party, and the Communist Party cannot eliminate the Kuomintang." They thought the opportunity to take advantage of the chaos had come. Zhang Bojun deployed military activities in East China, Southwest China, and Northwest China, believing that with guns, he could become a king and dominate, or at least divide the world into three parts with the people's regime and Chiang Kai-shek. Luo Longji colluded with American imperialism, wanting the United States to support China's so-called "third force." Luo Longji once suggested to Stuart Leiden: "The United States bought Chiang Kai-shek's horse and lost the bet. It is better to buy the Democratic League's horse, which can guarantee you win back." But Zhang Bojun did not have time and could not realize his military plan to become a king and dominate, and American imperialism did not make up its mind to bet on Luo Longji's horse. From 1948 to 1949, due to the successive victories of the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and liberated the whole of China. The so-called middle road or third road became a nightmare, and now it is completely shattered.

Although the middle road is essentially a reactionary political line, it still has a positive side during the democratic revolution period, that is, the anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang side. But after the national liberation, the middle road has lost all positive factors and has become a thorough reactionary line. After the Chinese revolution entered the period of transition to socialism, there were only two roads in front of the bourgeoisie, either to take the road of socialist transformation, that is, to accept the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party; or to take the old road of capitalism, that is, to oppose the people and oppose the leadership of the Communist Party. There is no third road. The door to socialist transformation is open to everyone. The question is which road people choose.

On the surface, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji chose the former road. They represented the Democratic League and the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in the People's Political Consultative Conference, participated in the people's regime, accepted the Common Program, and later accepted the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. This means that they accepted the leadership of the Communist Party and accepted the general line of transition to socialism. Luo Longji said that he made mistakes because Chairman Mao did not put forward the six political criteria in his speech at the Supreme State Council on February 27. This is nonsense. Are the six political criteria, taking the socialist road, and accepting the leadership of the Communist Party, not all clearly written in the Constitution?

The facts revealed in the struggle against the right-wingers prove that Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji, from the national liberation until now, have not chosen the socialist road, but have chosen the road of anti-communism, anti-people, and anti-socialism. They have consistently played two-faced tricks. They pretended to accept socialist transformation and accept the leadership of the Communist Party, but secretly they have never stopped their anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds.

**Zhang and Luo Thought the Opportunity to Take Advantage of the Chaos Had Arrived**

In the first few years after liberation, due to the great victories of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements, the Party and the government were unanimously supported and trusted by the people of the country. There was no hope for the bourgeois right-wingers to carry out open anti-communist and anti-socialist activities. The facts prove that Zhang Bojun bought old books and ran to antique shops during these years, pretending to be politically inactive, but actually waiting for an opportunity to change. Luo Longji arranged his anti-communist clique within the Democratic League, calling it "meeting friends through literature." During this period, there were contradictions between Zhang and Luo, mainly manifested in their competition for the leadership position of the Democratic League, but the goals of their actions were still consistent, that is, to prepare for the opportunity to seize the leadership of the Party and implement the restoration of capitalism.

The bourgeoisie always looks at problems based on their own subjective wishes, not according to the objective laws of the development of things. Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji both had a subjective wish, that is, China would be in great chaos, and the world would be in great chaos. When there was great chaos, socialism would not be successful, and the people's regime would not be stable. Therefore, the bourgeoisie could replace it. Zhang Bojun often said to people that there would be great changes in three years, great changes in two years, and great changes in one year. Luo Longji never believed that the tense international situation had a tendency to ease. This is because they all look at problems from the subjective wish of anti-communism and anti-socialism.

The past year, 1956, was indeed a year of great changes. There were changes in the domestic situation in China, and there were also changes in the international situation. But this is by no means the "great change" that Zhang and Luo subjectively wished for. Last year, our country's three major socialist transformations achieved basic victory, and there were great achievements in industrial and agricultural construction and cultural and educational construction. This means that the socialist cause is more consolidated, not weakened; the prestige of the Party and the government is more improved, not reduced. Although the anti-communist and anti-people world trend that occurred due to the Polish and Hungarian incidents was not a good thing, the socialist camp was more united and stronger due to the correct handling of these incidents, and the imperialist conspiracy to subvert Hungary completely failed.

Due to being blinded by profit, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji made completely opposite wrong estimates of the current situation. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji believed that the socialist camp was weakened, China had internal difficulties, and the opportunity to take advantage of the chaos was coming soon. Even if it was not an immediate "great change", it would not be very far away. In July last year, Zhang Bojun said at the meeting of the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party: "Socialist democracy will continue to develop and change, and it is still changing. The situation will continue to change, and our responsibility is very great." What is Zhang Bojun's so-called "change"? It is to change socialism into capitalism. What is the "responsibility"? It is to attack the working class and the Communist Party, seize the leadership of the Party, and destroy the socialist system.

**The Purpose of the Zhang-Luo Alliance is to Overthrow the Leadership of the Communist Party. It Has Strategies, Tactics, and Steps**

To do such a major event, you need a strong team. Therefore, the anti-communist and anti-socialist alliance of Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji was formed. Zhang Bojun has a set of revisionist theories that disguise Marxism-Leninism, and also has a set of rogue politician experiences accumulated over thirty years. Luo Longji has his sectarian clique and a large number of bourgeois intellectuals influenced by him. Zhang and Luo separately cannot do big things, but together, the momentum is almost the same!

What is the Zhang-Luo alliance for? According to the materials that have been revealed now, the conspiracy group headed by Zhang and Luo has a clear political program. First of all, they want to start by shaking our country's socialist system, trying to replace the proletarian dictatorship with the bourgeois dictatorship, replace the people's congress system with the British and American parliamentary system, and replace democratic centralism with the bourgeois two-party rotation system. Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, and other major right-wingers have frequently published various fallacies in the meetings of the CPPCC and state power organs in the past year, and their spearhead is mainly aimed at the people's congress system and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. Zhang Bojun said when conveying Chairman Mao's report on the Ten Major Relationships in the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party: "Now many people say that capitalism is not good. In fact, capitalism still has vitality. Why does it have vitality? Because there is a multi-party system, a democratic system, upper and lower houses, and a ruling party and an opposition party. The capitalist method is: if you don't work, I will; if I don't work, you will. The ruling party scolds the opposition party, and the opposition party scolds the ruling party, so it has vitality." The political design institute, the rehabilitation committee, and Chu Anping's fallacy about the Party's world, proposed by the Zhang-Luo alliance, are just some strange opinions when viewed in isolation, and it is not easy to understand their true intentions. But when combined, it is very clear that the Zhang-Luo alliance wants to replace the people's democratic system with bourgeois democracy, and more importantly, to weaken and even overthrow the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party. Once the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party is weakened, and the superstructure is shaken, it will pave the way for the restoration of capitalism and create conditions for the bourgeois dictatorship.

In terms of foreign policy, the Zhang-Luo alliance is anti-Soviet and does not approve of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. In terms of cultural and educational policy, Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji have consistently opposed the Party's leadership of cultural and educational organs, believing that Communist Party members do not understand science, so they cannot lead science. Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji do not recognize that the Soviet Union has culture and science, and advocate that science should be learned from Britain and the United States. Zhang Bojun regards himself as a defender of morality. He believes that Marxism-Leninism is dogma, and only thread-bound books are worth reading. Does Zhang Bojun really value the national cultural tradition? No. He is just using the protection of national culture as a guise to slander the Communist Party for not wanting national culture, thereby attracting a group of backward old intellectuals to expand the anti-communist influence.

If we say that the Zhang-Luo anti-communist alliance is only due to a temporary impulse and takes completely blind action, this is wrong. In fact, it has strategies, tactics, and steps. The materials that have been revealed prove that the anti-communist conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance takes a part of the intellectuals who are dissatisfied with the Party as the basic masses. It takes advantage of the temporary unfamiliarity of a part of the untransformed intellectuals with the new socialist system, or even serious resistance, exaggerates certain shortcomings of a part of the worker-peasant cadres in their work, carries out instigation and alienation, and attempts to first seize the Party's leadership over cultural and scientific undertakings, seize the Party's core leadership in universities, and spread the poison of absolute democracy and individual liberalism to incite intellectuals and youths, causing dissatisfaction with the Party, so that when the time comes, a Hungarian incident will be created in China. They once estimated: "Don't look at the fact that scholars' rebellions will not succeed in three years. Chinese intellectuals have a tradition of making trouble. From the Taixue students of the Han Dynasty to the 'May Fourth' movement, students have made trouble."

**This Alliance Uses Legal Organizations to Carry Out Illegal Activities and Controls the Leadership of the Democratic League**

In order to realize this anti-communist conspiracy, it is natural to have full organizational preparations. The Zhang-Luo alliance uses legal organizations to carry out illegal activities. Therefore, it must first control the leadership of the Democratic League, which is to exclude Comrade Shen Junru, the chairman of the Democratic League, and other left-wing progressive elements in the Democratic League, and win over some middle elements to attract them to the right-wing side. Zhang and Luo both advocated that the democratic parties should be greatly developed, and the Democratic League should develop one to two million members, and also develop organizations among young people and even workers and peasants. Zhang Bojun advocated abolishing the "defense zone system", which means that the democratic parties should not have key divisions of labor in developing organizations and should not have any restrictions. In terms of propaganda work, the Zhang-Luo alliance first controlled *Guangming Daily* and *Wenhui Bao*, and at the same time founded some organs of the democratic parties to carry out propaganda and mobilization for their anti-communist and anti-socialist programs.

It takes a certain amount of time to prepare these organizational and propaganda work. From the second half of 1956, in fact, the Zhang-Luo alliance has been actively carrying out activities. Zhang Bojun made some subjective estimates of the Chinese Communist Party's rectification. He believed that the CCP had gradually lost its prestige among the masses. Once the Party's rectification was carried out, it would surely cause dissatisfaction among the masses. Then, it would be possible to launch an attack on the Party, and the opportunity to seize the leadership of the Party would come. This spring, the CCP announced that it would not start rectification until 1958. Therefore, in the work conference of the Democratic League in March and April of this year, although Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji made some anti-communist and anti-socialist absurd statements and made some organizational arrangements to mobilize the local organizations of the Democratic League and the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party to vigorously develop, especially to absorb a group of right-wing reactionary elements who were dissatisfied with the Party to join the democratic parties, their actions were still very hidden, and they were still trying their best to avoid exposing their true colors.

**The Original Plan Has Been Disrupted, and the Conspiracy Has Finally Been Completely Exposed**

Then came the "unusual spring". After Chairman Mao Zedong made a speech on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People", the Party adopted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." By the end of April, the Party announced that the rectification would start ahead of schedule. At this time, on the one hand, the original plan of the Zhang-Luo alliance had been disrupted. Before the organizational preparations were completed, they had to go to war in a hurry. On the other hand, the opportunity could not be lost. The Zhang-Luo alliance controlled the two parties and two newspapers, took anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist actions, and launched a rampant attack on the working class and the Communist Party. As the editorial of *People's Daily* on July 1 said, "They summoned wind and rain, pushed waves, or planned in secret rooms, or ignited at the grassroots level, connected up and down, and responded in all directions." On June 6, at the meeting convened by Zhang Bojun at the Cultural Club, Zhang Bojun advocated blackmailing the Party and letting the Democratic League "clean up the mess" in order to seize the leadership of universities. His arrogance can be said to have reached the extreme. The conspiracy and ambition of the Zhang-Luo alliance were completely exposed at this time.

The bourgeois right-wingers are unwilling to withdraw from the political stage and are so crazy that they dare to attack the working class, attack the Communist Party, and attack the socialist cause. The people's eyes are sharp. The people will never allow the socialist cause to suffer losses, will never allow the socialist system to be destroyed, and will never allow the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party to be rampantly attacked. After the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracy was completely exposed to the people of the country, the crushing of the Zhang-Luo anti-communist alliance was inevitable and not surprising.

**What Lessons Should Intellectuals Learn From This Bad Thing of the Zhang-Luo Alliance**

The anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance is a bad thing. Chairman Mao taught us that as long as we learn from the lessons, bad things can become good things, and bad things can lead to good results. The people of the country, especially intellectuals, should learn from this incident that only by resolutely taking the socialist road and truly accepting the leadership of the Communist Party is the only way out. If they leave the leadership of the Party, they will lose their way and eventually fall into the quagmire of the bourgeois right-wingers. I completely agree with what Premier Zhou said in the government work report: "Although the bourgeois right-wingers are in the ranks of the people, they stand on the anti-socialist position and even take actions that are not conducive to the socialist cause. Therefore, we must draw a clear line between ourselves and the right-wingers politically and ideologically, and conduct the necessary and resolute struggle against such people, so that the vast majority of truly patriotic people can recognize the mistakes of the right-wingers' position and behavior." I also believe that the exposure of the conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance and other bourgeois right-wingers will surely educate the people of the country to unite more closely around the Communist Party and march towards the bright road of socialist construction.

    章罗联盟的透视
    胡愈之的发言
    全国人民代表大会这一次会议揭发和批判了资产阶级右派分子反共、反人民、反社会主义的荒谬言论和罪恶行为。由于右派分子向党、向社会主义的猖狂进攻，目前，在全国范围内正在展开一场激烈的斗争——社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。我同意各位代表在大会和小组会上对右派分子进行揭发、批判、控诉的各项发言。我愿意跟各位代表一起，跟全国工、农、知识分子一起，投入到反右派斗争中，并且要把这一场激烈的政治、思想斗争贯彻到底，不得到胜利不收兵。我是中国民主同盟盟员，现在我就章（伯钧）罗（隆基）联盟及其反共反社会主义的罪恶阴谋，在大会上进行揭露、分析和批判，请代表们共同加以谴责和声讨。
    章罗联盟是资产阶级右派分子结成的阴谋集团
    首先分析一下资产阶级右派分子和章罗联盟的本质。
    一九三九年当中国民主革命正在进行的时候，毛泽东主席就已经指出中国民族资产阶级是带两重性的阶级。“……他们在一定时期中和一定程度上能够参加反帝国主义和反官僚军阀政府的革命，他们可以成为革命的一种力量。而在另一时期，就有跟在买办大资产阶级后面，作为反革命的助手的危险。”
    在全国解放以后，中国革命进入到社会主义革命的阶段，到了一九五六年，社会主义革命取得了基本胜利。在这一时期中，由于中国共产党对民族资产阶级采取了团结改造的正确政策，民族资产阶级接受了赎买政策，交出为他们所占有的生产资料，逐步地接受社会主义改造。他们中间的知识分子，有一大部分接受了思想改造，其中一小部分改变了资产阶级世界观，开始转变成为劳动知识分子。
    但是，这只是一方面。
    在另一方面，作为整个阶级来说，资产阶级是决不甘心退出政治舞台的。在社会主义革命进行的过程中，资产阶级，包含他们里面的知识分子在内，就有很大一部分，仍然在社会主义和资本主义这两条道路中间摇摆着，他们有接受工人阶级、共产党领导的一面，又有抗拒工人阶级、共产党的领导的一面，这是资产阶级的中间派。另外又有一小批人是资产阶级右派，他们是坚决反共、反社会主义的，他们处心积虑，待机观变，要夺取共产党的领导权，推翻人民民主专政，把中华人民共和国重新拉回到资本主义的反动道路上去。
    资产阶级右派分子的人数是很少的，但是由于他们是坚决反共、反社会主义的，并且他们能够影响为数众多的资产阶级中间派，所以他们的危害性是很大的。章（伯钧）、罗（隆基）联盟就是由这些资产阶级右派分子结合起来的反共、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋集团。
    章、罗两人反共的政治本质
    章伯钧、罗隆基是怎样一种人呢？罗隆基说：“把我的骨头烧成灰，也找不出一点反共、反社会主义的东西。”这完全错了。应当这样说才对：把章伯钧、罗隆基的骨头烧成灰，也仍然是反共、反人民的，断然闻不出一点社会主义的气息。
    章伯钧，地主阶级出身，留学德国时参加中国共产党。一九二七年大革命失败，他就脱离共产党，参加第三党——中国农工民主党的前身。第三党在当时号召中国应当走第三条道路，就是既反蒋又反共的中间路线。从那时候起，章伯钧就鼓吹第二国际考茨基的反共理论。列宁曾经说过：“考茨基完全曲解了马克思学说，将其赝造成为机会主义。”又说：“他在口头上承认革命，实际上却背弃了革命。”所以章伯钧传受了叛徒考茨基的衣钵，歪曲马克思列宁主义，挂修正主义的招牌，贩资本主义的私货，三十年以来是一贯的。
    罗隆基毕业清华大学，在美国哥伦比亚大学学政治。回国后成为胡适门下的走卒，曾任新月月刊和天主教机关报益世报总编辑。他在一九三○年十月，在新月月刊上写道：“在今日中国的状况下，为中国人民求生路计，自然只有希望国民党剿共及早成功。谚所谓‘两恶相权取其轻’，即此意耳。”在同年十二月他又在“告日本国民和中国的当局”这篇文章里写道：“如今，中国的青年界里，已有这样的呼声：‘与其归日，宁愿附俄’。中国共产的成功，固为中国之祸，亦非日本之福。俄国如今已乘机兴起。中日鹬蚌之争，共产渔人之利，一旦东亚全部赤化，复巢之下，宁有完卵！这又是日本有智识有眼光的国民和政治家应顾虑的一点。”
    罗隆基曾经说过：“章伯钧是七分反蒋，三分反共；我是六分反蒋，四分反共。”章伯钧也说：“农工民主党靠反共起家，而民盟靠中间路线起家。”章罗两人一贯耍两面派手法，但是这两句话说得比较老实。由此可见，章伯钧和罗隆基从开始搞政治活动起，已经是坚决反共的资产阶级分子。在民主革命时期，特别是从抗日战争的后期起，他们两人又都走着一边反蒋一边反共的中间道路。天下老鸦一般黑，从反共的政治本质来看，他们两人是完全一致的。章伯钧和罗隆基到后来终于结成了反共、反人民、反社会主义联盟，不是偶然的，是因为他们两人本来就已经有了共同的阶级基础和共同的思想根源。
    抗日战争结束以后，章罗极力要把民盟引导到反动的第三条道路上
    作为没落阶级的代表人物，章伯钧和罗隆基是完全相同的。但是他们所代表的阶层仍然不完全相同。章伯钧自称为马路政客，也就是流氓政客，他所代表的是资产阶级里面带有浓厚的封建性买办性的一批社会渣滓：旧军阀、旧官僚、流氓、地痞、从地主阶级出身的旧知识分子以及在革命斗争中掉了队的那些人们。另一方面，罗隆基所代表的是资产阶级知识分子，主要是英美留学生，其中有一些是在学术界有一定地位和声望的。其中又有一部分人在后来这几年思想有很大进步。但是他们在没有经过思想改造之前从头到脚盖着资产阶级的烙印，他们梦想着要按照资本主义的型式来改造中国社会。美国前国务卿艾奇逊所寄托希望的“民主个人主义者”就是指罗隆基所代表的这一批未经改造的资产阶级知识分子。
    在抗日战争结束以后，章伯钧和罗隆基仍然在做着中间路线的迷梦，要把民主同盟引导到反动的第三条道路上去。他们从来没有估计到中国人民的伟大力量，他们满以为内战要无限期地延长下去，“国民党不能消灭共产党，共产党也不能消灭国民党。”他们以为趁火打劫混水摸鱼的机会到来了。章伯钧就在华东、西南、西北布置军事活动，满以为有了枪杆子，就可以称王道霸，至少可以同人民政权和蒋介石三分天下。罗隆基就勾搭美帝国主义，要美国扶植中国所谓“第三种势力”。罗隆基曾经向司徒雷登建议：“美国买了蒋介石这匹马，赌输了，还是买民主同盟这匹马罢，可以保你赢回来。”但是章伯钧还来不及也不可能实现他的称王道霸的军事计划，美帝国主义也并没有下决心赌罗隆基这匹马。从一九四八到一九四九年，由于人民解放军的节节胜利，中国人民在中国共产党领导之下，推翻了国民党反动统治，解放了全中国。所谓中间路线或第三条道路，变成一场恶梦，现在是完全破灭了。
    中间路线虽然在本质上是反动的政治路线。虽然在民主革命时期，它还有积极的一面，这就是反日反蒋的一面。可是到了全国解放以后，中间路线已经丧失一切积极的因素，而成为彻头彻尾反动的路线了。中国革命进入到向社会主义过渡的时期之后，横在资产阶级面前的路只有两条，或者是走社会主义改造的道路，这就是接受工人阶级、共产党的领导；或者是走资本主义的旧道路，这就是反人民、反共产党的领导。第三条道路是没有的。社会主义改造的大门是向一切的人们开着的，问题是在于人们选择那一条道路。
    在表面上章伯钧、罗隆基是选择前一条道路的。他们代表了民盟和农工民主党参加了人民政协，参加了人民政权，接受了共同纲领，后来又接受了中华人民共和国宪法，这就是说他们接受了共产党领导，接受了向社会主义过渡的总路线。罗隆基说：他因为毛主席二月二十七日在最高国务会议上讲话中，没有提出六项政治标准，所以犯错误。这是胡说。六项政治标准，走社会主义道路，接受共产党领导，难道还不是都在宪法上写明白的吗？
    从反右派分子斗争中所揭发的事实证明，章伯钧、罗隆基从全国解放以后一直到现在，并没有选择了社会主义的道路，而是选择了反共、反人民、反社会主义的道路。他们是一贯玩两面派手法的，他们伪装着接受社会主义改造，接受共产党领导，暗中却没有一天停止过反共、反社会主义的言论和行动。
    章罗以为趁火打劫时机已到
    在解放以后的最初几年中，由于抗美援朝、土地改革、三反五反的巨大胜利，党和政府受到了全国人民的一致拥护和信任，资产阶级右派分子要进行反共、反社会主义的公开活动，是没有任何希望的。事实证明，章伯钧在这几年中买旧书，跑古董铺，在政治上伪装消极，实际上是在待机观变。罗隆基在民盟内布置他的反共小集团，美其名曰“以文会友”。在这一时期，章、罗两人是有矛盾的，主要表现在他们争夺民盟的领导地位，但是他们的行动的目标仍然是一致的，就是准备时机到来，夺去党的领导权，实行资本主义的复辟。
    资产阶级总是凭着自己的主观愿望，而不是按照事物发展的客观规律来看问题的。章伯钧和罗隆基都有一个主观愿望，就是中国要大乱，世界要大乱，大乱的时候社会主义就搞不成了，人民政权也就站不稳了，于是乎资产阶级就可以取而代之。章伯钧时常对人说，三年以后要有大变，二年以后、一年以后要有大变。罗隆基总不相信国际紧张形势有趋向缓和的可能。这就是由于他们都是从反共、反社会主义的主观愿望来看问题的。
    过去的一年，一九五六年确实是大变动的一年。中国国内形势有变动，国际形势也有变动。可是这决不是像章、罗主观愿望所设想的那种“大变”。去年我国社会主义三大改造获得基本胜利，工农业建设和文教建设都有很大成就，这是说社会主义事业是更加巩固，而不是削弱了；党和政府的威信是更加提高，而不是降低了。由于波兰、匈牙利事件而发生的反共、反人民的世界性的风潮，虽然不是好事，但是由于这些事件的正确处理，社会主义阵营是更加团结，更加坚强了，帝国主义要向匈牙利进行颠覆活动的阴谋完全失败了。
    由于利令智昏，章伯钧、罗隆基对于当前形势，却作了完全相反的错误估计。在苏共二十次代表大会以后，章伯钧、罗隆基就认为社会主义阵营削弱，中国内部有困难，趁火打劫的时机快要到来，即使不是立即“大变”，也不会是很远了。去年七月章伯钧在农工民主党的会议上说：“社会主义民主还要发展变化，现在正在继续变化。形势还要变，我们大家的责任很重大。”章伯钧所谓“变”是什么呢？就是变社会主义为资本主义。“责任”又是什么呢？就是要向工人阶级和共产党进攻，夺取党的领导权，破坏社会主义制度。
    章罗结成联盟的目的，是推翻共产党的领导地位，它有战略战术，也有方针步骤
    要干这样的一件大事，就得要一个强大的队伍，于是章伯钧、罗隆基的反共、反社会主义的联盟就结合起来了。章伯钧有一套伪装马列主义的修正主义理论，也有一套积累三十年的流氓政客经验。罗隆基呢，他有他的宗派小集团，和受他的影响的一大批资产阶级知识分子。章、罗分开，是干不了大事的，但是合起来，声势就差不多了！
    章罗联盟到底为的是干什么？从现在已经揭发的材料来看，以章罗为首的阴谋集团，是有明确的政治纲领的。首先，他们要从动摇我国的社会主义制度入手，企图用资产阶级专政，来代替无产阶级专政，用英美式的议会制度，来代替人民代表大会制度，用资产阶级的两党轮流执政来代替民主集中制。章伯钧、罗隆基和其他主要的右派分子，这一年来在政协和政权机关的会议上，经常发表各种谬论，矛头主要针对着人民代表大会制和肃反工作。章伯钧在农工民主党传达毛主席关于十大关系的报告时说：“现在很多人说资本主义不好，事实上资本主义也还有生命力。为什么有生命力，就因为有多党制度，有民主制度，有上下院，有在朝党和在野党。资本主义的办法是：你不行，我来；我不行，你来。在朝的骂在野的，在野的骂在朝的，这就有生命力。”章、罗联盟所提出的政治设计院、平反委员会和储安平关于党天下的谬论，孤立起来看，只是一些怪议论，是不容易了解真正用意的。但是结合起来看，就很明白，章罗联盟是要用资产阶级民主来代替人民民主制度，而更主要的是要削弱以至推翻工人阶级、共产党的领导地位。工人阶级、共产党的领导削弱了，上层建筑动摇了，这样就为资本主义复辟铺平了道路，为资产阶级专政创造了条件。
    在外交政策上，章罗联盟是反苏的，不赞成以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结。在文教政策上，章伯钧、罗隆基一贯地反对党领导文教机关，认为共产党员不懂科学，所以不能领导科学，章伯钧和罗隆基都不承认苏联有文化和科学，主张科学要学英美。章伯钧是以卫道者自居的。他认为马列主义是教条，只有线装书才值得一读。章伯钧是不是真的重视民族文化传统呢？不是的。他不过是拿保卫民族文化作为幌子，诬蔑共产党不要民族文化，借此勾引一批落后的旧知识分子来扩大反共的影响罢了。
    如果说，章、罗反共联盟只是由于一时冲动，采取完全盲目的行动，这是错了。事实上它有战略战术，也有方针步骤。从已经揭发的材料证明，章、罗联盟的反共阴谋，是以对党不满的一部分知识分子作为基本群众的。它利用了一部分未经改造的知识分子对新的社会主义制度的暂时不习惯，甚至有严重抵触，夸大了一部分工农干部在工作中的某些缺点，进行挑拨离间，企图首先夺去党对文化科学事业的领导，夺去党在高等学校中的核心领导，并且散播绝对民主和个人自由主义的毒素，煽惑知识分子和青年，引起对党的不满，以便于时机到来的时候，在中国造成一次匈牙利事变。他们曾经这样的估计：“不要看秀才造反三年不成，中国知识分子闹事是有传统的，从汉朝的太学生到‘五四’都是学生闹起来的。”
    这个联盟利用合法组织来进行非法活动，控制民盟的领导权
    为了实现这一反共阴谋，自然还必须在组织上有充分的准备。章、罗联盟是用合法组织来进行非法活动的，因此它首先要控制民盟内部的领导权，这就是要排斥民盟的主席沈钧儒同志和其他民盟里面的左翼进步分子，并争取一些中间分子吸引到右派这一方面。章、罗都主张民主党派要大发展，民盟要发展一二百万盟员，还要到青年甚至工农中发展组织。章伯钧主张取消“防区制”，这就是说民主党派发展组织不要有重点分工，不要有任何限制。在宣传工作方面，章罗联盟首先控制光明日报和文汇报，同时创办一些民主党派的机关刊物，为他们的反共反社会主义纲领进行宣传鼓动。
    要做好这一些组织和宣传工作的准备，是需要一定时间的。从一九五六年下半年起，事实上章、罗联盟已经在积极进行活动。章伯钧把中国共产党的整风作了一些主观主义的估计。他认为中共在群众中间已经逐渐失去威信，党内一整风，一定会引起群众不满，到那时就可以向党发动进攻，夺去党的领导权的机会就到来了。在今年春间，中共宣布要在一九五八年才开始整风，所以章伯钧和罗隆基在本年三、四月的民盟工作会议中，虽然一方面发表了一些反共、反社会主义的荒谬言论，并且作了一些组织布置，发动民盟和农工民主党的地方组织大力发展，特别是吸收一批对党不满的右派反动分子加入民主党派，但是他们的行动仍然是十分隐蔽的，他们还竭力避免暴露他们的真面目。
    原定计划已被打乱，阴谋终于完全暴露了
    于是“不平常的春天”到来了。在毛泽东主席作了“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话以后，党采取了“大鸣”“大放”的政策，到四月底，党又宣布了整风提前开始。到了这时候，一方面章、罗联盟的原定计划已经被打乱，在还没有作好组织准备之前，就只好仓皇出战，另一方面时机是不可失去的，章、罗联盟就控制了两个党派和两个日报，采取反共、反人民、反社会主义的行动，向工人阶级和共产党进行猖狂的进攻。正如人民日报七月一日社论所说的，“呼风唤雨，推涛作浪，或策划于密室，或点火于基层，上下串连，八方呼应”。到了六月六日，在文化俱乐部由章伯钧召开的会议上，章伯钧主张向党进行讹诈，由民盟来“收拾残局”，以夺去高等学校中的领导权，狂妄可算是到了极点。章、罗联盟的阴谋野心，到了这时候才完全暴露了。
    资产阶级右派分子不甘心退出政治舞台，疯狂到这样程度，以至敢于向工人阶级进攻，向共产党进攻，向社会主义事业进攻。人民的眼睛是雪亮的，人民决不容许社会主义事业遭受损失，决不容许社会主义制度受到破坏，更不容许工人阶级、共产党的领导受到猖狂进攻。反共、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋，在全国人民面前完全暴露之后，章、罗反共联盟遭到粉碎，是必然的，是不值得惊异的。
    知识分子从章罗联盟这一坏事中应当记取什么教训
    章、罗联盟的反共、反人民、反社会主义阴谋，是一件坏事。毛主席教导我们，只要我们接受教训，坏事可以变成好事，坏的东西可以引出好的结果。全国人民，特别是知识分子应该从这一事件，接受教训，只有坚决地走社会主义道路，真正接受共产党领导才是唯一的出路，要是离开了党的领导，就会迷失方向，最后陷入资产阶级右派的泥坑中。我完全同意周总理政府工作报告中所说：“资产阶级右派分子虽然置身于人民的队伍之中，但是却站在反对社会主义的立场上，甚至采取不利于社会主义事业的行动。因此，我们必须在政治上和思想上同右派分子划清界限，对这种人进行必要的坚决的斗争，使绝大多数真正爱国的人认识到右派分子的立场和行为的错误。”我也相信章、罗联盟以及其他资产阶级右派分子阴谋的揭露，一定会教育全国人民更加紧密地团结在共产党的周围，向着社会主义建设的光明道路迈进。
