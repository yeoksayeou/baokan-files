Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh—Prince Sihanouk, in his closing speech at the Fifth National Congress of the People's Socialist Community on the evening of the 16th, stated that the ideal of the People's Socialist Community is to adhere to neutrality. He pointed out: "America scolds me because I have implemented a neutral policy against the will of the United States, and the United States has begun to reduce its aid to Cambodia year by year."

The Fifth Congress, which opened on July 15, discussed twenty-three issues, with economic and people's livelihood issues occupying a major place. Delegates discussed how to improve workers' housing, medical care, and welfare, and decided to allocate a portion of the national lottery revenue to build low-rent housing.

The Congress attacked the opposition, mainly the Democratic Party, and repeatedly emphasized the achievements of the People's Socialist Community. Prince Sihanouk said that if the Democratic Party came to power, we would perish because this party is bribed by the United States and serves the United States. He also criticized the People's Party. He added that all Cambodians must cherish the future of the nation.

At the Congress, the United States was openly condemned. A Cambodian driver from Kompong Som Bay accused Americans of persecuting him. He was unjustifiably dismissed and imprisoned by two Americans a few months ago. He was released only after the rescue of other workers. He questioned why Americans in Cambodia have the power to persecute Cambodian workers, and what Americans are doing in Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk said that we do not want anyone to be our master, and Americans cannot be our master either. He said that the government guarantees the rights of the people. The government will negotiate to resolve any such persecution incidents.

    西哈努克亲王愤慨陈词
    斥美国敌视中立政策
    柬人民社会同盟代表大会闭幕
    新华社金边讯  西哈努克亲王16日晚上在人民社会同盟第五次全国代表大会上发表闭幕演说时说，人民社会同盟的理想是忠于中立。他指出：“美国骂我，是因为我违背美国的意志执行了中立政策，而且美国已经开始逐年减少它对柬埔寨的援助。”
    7月15日开幕的第五次代表大会讨论了二十三个问题，经济和人民生活问题占据主要地位。代表们讨论了如何改善工人的住房、医疗和福利问题，并且决定从国家彩票收入中拨出一部分来建筑租价低廉的房屋。
    代表大会抨击了反对派，主要是民主党，并且一再强调人民社会同盟的成就。西哈努克亲王说，如果民主党执了政，我们将会灭亡，因为这个党受美国的贿赂，并且为美国服务。他还抨击了人民党。他又说，所有的柬埔寨人都必须珍视国家的前途。
    在代表大会上，美国受到公开谴责。一个来自磅逊湾的柬埔寨司机控诉美国人对他的迫害。他在几个月以前曾经毫无理由地被两个美国人解雇和监禁。经过其他工人的营救，他才被释放。他质问，为甚么在柬埔寨的美国人有权力迫害柬埔寨工人，美国人在柬埔寨是干甚么的？西哈努克亲王说，我们不要任何人当我们的主人，美国人也不能当我们的主人。他说，政府保障人民的权利。对于任何这类迫害事件，政府都将交涉解决。
