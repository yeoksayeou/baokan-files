    Brazil's Struggle for Peace
    Brazilian writer Jorge Amado
    The current political situation in Brazil is characterized, on the one hand, by the attempts of U.S. imperialism to tie our country to its chariot, thus intensifying its pressure on us; on the other hand, the Brazilian people's struggle against this U.S. interference and for an independent foreign policy has seen a significant increase.
    U.S. imperialism and its Brazilian allies—those reactionary agents who implement its policies—suffered a crushing defeat in November 1955 when the army, supported by the broad masses of the people, prevented a right-wing coup and enabled the new president of the republic, elected by the majority of the people, to take office. The current government, on the one hand, remains a government of the ruling class, i.e., large landowners and big capitalists, but on the other hand, it differs from previous governments in that it contains some patriotic elements. These elements hope that our country will achieve economic independence, advocate a foreign policy that maintains broad contacts with all countries, and adopt an independent policy that keeps Brazil at a distance from various military blocs and frees it from those conventions and agreements that drag it into war. The government vacillates between various factions. It has also taken some measures in line with the interests of the people, such as rejecting the nuclear energy agreement with the United States at the request of the people and patriotic factions within the government. But recently it has made more and more concessions to the right wing. What the right wing demands is complete submission to U.S. imperialism.
    Therefore, in recent months, the government has made some serious concessions to U.S. imperialism. The most important of these is the cession of the territory of Fernando de Noronha Island to the Americans, allowing them to set up a "missile launch test station" on the island, which is actually a military base. The act of ceding Fernando de Noronha Island did not initially encounter serious resistance from patriotic factions within the government, but it immediately caused an uproar among the people, especially among the working class, intellectuals, and national bourgeoisie. The people immediately realized that this move was extremely detrimental to national interests because it put Brazil at risk of being drawn into a new global conflict. On the other hand, it also meant that this was the first step in establishing U.S. military bases along the entire northeast coast of Brazil and was a signal of imperialism's large-scale encroachment on our country's oil and other mineral resources.
    What U.S. imperialists covet most are Brazil's oil and atomic energy minerals. The enactment of the "Brazilian Petroleum Company" law, which stipulated the nationalization of our country's oil, was a great victory for the Brazilian people. The rejection of the nuclear energy agreement was also such a victory. Now, the U.S. offensive is precisely aimed at these two great democratic achievements. At the same time, the United States is also demanding military bases and urging our country to sign the South Atlantic Treaty, a military pact that would tie South American countries to the U.S. chariot.
    Accompanying these concessions by the government are some anti-democratic measures, such as the banning of patriotic organizations like the National Liberation Alliance, threats to freedom of the press (these threats were thwarted by the people's movement), and attempts by reactionaries to unite, etc.
    The act of ceding Fernando de Noronha has awakened the entire Brazilian people and patriots from all parties, classes, and professions, including some who participate in the government or are part of the parliamentary majority coalition. A large-scale national movement has been launched, and this movement is currently of great momentum, demanding that the agreement on ceding the territory of Fernando de Noronha be submitted to the parliament for review. The government is trying to avoid doing so because it is convinced that the parliament, in which patriotic elements occupy a strong proportion, will certainly not pass this agreement. The people's anger is growing, and patriots are increasingly determined not to allow any further concessions to U.S. imperialists and to force the government to submit the agreement on Fernando de Noronha Island to the parliament. At present, this is a large-scale mass movement that is shaking every corner of Brazil.
    The most important and prominent fact in the Brazilian political situation is the rapid growth of forces opposing U.S. domination. At the forefront of these forces is the proletariat, whose process of unity—the unity of communist workers, labor party workers (influenced by Vargas), socialist workers, Catholic workers, etc.—is strengthening, especially in large cities like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. United with the proletariat are the petty bourgeoisie, almost all intellectuals, and the emerging and increasingly demanding national bourgeoisie, who want more participation in the government. These forces are gradually forming a unity in the process of struggle. There are vacillations and difficulties in this process, but nothing can stop the definite trend of this development. These forces demand that the government adopt a firm policy of resisting U.S. hegemony, revise Brazil's foreign policy, and shift to an independent policy that keeps us out of any armed conflict and allows us to maintain diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations with all countries in the world. A strong neutralist trend is emerging among the forces of the national bourgeoisie, and this trend even includes certain factions of the ruling class, such as some coffee planters, cocoa planters, and cotton plantation owners who hope to sell their products to socialist countries. As for domestic policy, these forces demand respect for the constitution, respect for democratic freedoms, especially freedom of association and freedom of the press, and the adoption of firm policies to curb the soaring cost of living, which has reached an alarming level.
    Therefore, the struggle for peace unfolding in Brazil is equipped with extremely favorable objective conditions. For this purpose, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the reality and for peace advocates to carry out the broadest and least dogmatic activities in accordance with this reality. Sectarianism and dogmatism have seriously damaged the development of the struggle for peace and the rapid realization of the patriotic united front, which is composed of all elements opposed to U.S. imperialism and its plans to drag our country into its adventures and make our country a factor in the Cold War. This united front is actually emerging everywhere: in factories, in some rural areas (although work among farmers is the most backward), among intellectuals, and among all factions, sectors, parties, and prominent figures. This front must be encouraged, promoted, given content through concrete struggles and current goals, and given form. To do this, Brazilian peace advocates must abandon any remnants of sectarianism, dogmatism, and complacency and strive to move forward with anyone, any force, any faction, any prominent figure, as long as they are willing to take a step forward on the point of adopting an independent foreign policy, no matter how small or vacillating that step may be.

    巴西争取和平的斗争
    巴西作家  若热·亚马多
    目前巴西政治局势的特点，一方面，是美帝国主义企图把我国拴在它的战车上，因而对我国变本加厉地施加压力；另一方面，是巴西人民反对美国这一干涉、争取独立的对外政策的斗争有了显著的增长。
    美帝国主义及其巴西同盟者——那些执行它的政策的反动代理人——在1955年11月曾经遭受过一次惨重的失败，当时陆军在广大人民群众的支持下，制止了一场右派政变，并使由大多数人民选出的共和国新总统得以就职。现任政府一方面仍是统治阶级即大地主和大资本家的政府，但另一方面它又与以前历届政府有所不同，因为它内部有一些爱国分子。这些分子希望我国得到经济独立，主张采取一种与所有各国保持广泛联系的对外政策，采取一种独立的政策，使巴西能对各个军事集团保持距离，并摆脱那些把它拖入战争中的公约与协定。政府在各个派别之间摇摆不定。它也曾经采取过一些符合人民利益的措施，例如在人民以及政府内部爱国派的要求下否决了与美国签订的原子能协定。但最近以来它却越来越向右翼让步。而右翼所要求的，是向美帝国主义完全屈服。
    所以，在最近几个月来，政府向美帝国主义作了一些严重的让步。这些让步之中，最重要的，是把裴南多诺隆耶岛的领土出让给美国人，让他们在岛上设立“导弹发射试验站”，实际上也就是设立一处军事基地。出让裴南多诺隆耶岛的行为，最初并没有遭到政府内部爱国派的严重反抗，但却马上在人民当中，首先是在工人阶级、知识分子和民族资产阶级分子当中引起轩然大波。人民马上就明白到，这种举动极为有害于民族利益，因为它使巴西有被卷入一个新的世界性冲突的危险。另一方面，它也意味着这是在整个巴西东北海岸建立美国军事基地的第一步，是帝国主义向我国的石油和其他矿产富源大举侵犯的讯号。
    美帝国主义者所觊觎的，首先就是巴西的石油和原子能矿物。关于成立“巴西石油公司”的法案，规定了把我国石油收归国有，这是巴西人民的一个巨大胜利。原子能协定的否决也是如此。现在美国的攻势，恰恰是针对这两个巨大的民主果实。同时，美国还要求取得军事基地，驱使我国签订南大西洋公约，这一个军事公约将把南美洲各国拴在美国的战车上。
    伴随着政府的这些让步而来的，是一些反民主措施，例如查封了一些像民族解放同盟这样的爱国团体，威胁新闻自由（这些威胁在人民运动制止之下没有得逞），反动分子试图联合起来等等。
    出让裴南多诺隆耶的行为，唤醒了巴西全体人民和所有各个政党、各个阶级与各种职业的爱国人士，甚至包括一些参加政府或参加国会多数派联盟的爱国人士。一个大规模的全国性运动开展起来了，这个运动目前声势浩大，要求把关于出让裴南多诺隆耶领土的协定提交国会，由国会审议。政府极力躲避这样做，因为它深信，爱国分子在其中占着有力比重的国会，是一定不会通过这个协定的。人民的愤怒与日俱增，爱国人士日益坚决不允许再向美帝国主义者作任何让步，并要迫使政府把关于裴南多诺隆耶岛的协定提交国会。在目前来说，这是一个震荡着巴西每一个角落的大规模群众运动。
    巴西政治局势中最重要、最突出的事实，就是反对美国统治的力量迅速壮大。站在这些力量的前列的，是无产阶级，它的团结过程——共产党工人、劳工党工人（瓦加斯党影响下的）、社会党工人、天主教工人等等的团结过程——正在加强，尤其是在像里约热内卢和圣保罗这样的大城市。与无产阶级联合起来的，有小资产阶级，有几乎全体的知识分子，有新兴的、日益要求更多地参加政府的民族资产阶级的日益强大的力量。这些力量在斗争过程中逐渐形成一种团结。在这个过程当中是有动摇和困难的，但这种发展的确定趋向是什么东西也制止不了的。这些力量要求政府采取一种反抗美国横行霸道的坚定政策，修改巴西对外政策，转而采取一种使我们置身于任何武装冲突之外并能与全世界一切国家保持外交、经济与文化关系的独立政策。民族资产阶级的势力当中正在出现一股强大的中立主义潮流，这股潮流甚至也包括了统治阶级的某些派别，例如某些希望把自己的产品出售给社会主义世界各国的咖啡园主、可可园主、棉花种植场主。至于对内政策方面，这些力量要求尊重宪法，尊重民主自由，首先是结社自由和新闻自由，并采取坚定的政策来制止那达到了触目惊心程度的生活费用高昂的现象。
    所以，在巴西展开争取和平的斗争，是具备了种种极为有利的客观条件的。为了这个目的，就必须对现实情况加以深入的了解，并需要和平拥护者按照这种现实情况来进行尽量广泛、尽量不教条主义的活动。宗派主义和教条主义曾经严重地损害了争取和平的斗争的发展，损害了爱国统一战线的迅速实现，组成这条统一战线的，是一切反对美帝国主义，反对它那些把我国拖进它的冒险之中并使我国成为冷战因素的计划的分子。这个统一战线实际上正在所有各处出现着：在工厂中，在某些农村地区（虽然在农民当中的工作最落后），在知识分子当中，在各派、各界、各政党和知名人士当中。必须鼓励这条战线，推动它，通过具体斗争和当前的目标来赋与它以内容，并赋与它以形式。为了这样，巴西的和平拥护者必须抛弃任何宗派主义、教条主义、骄傲自满的残余，并努力与任何人、任何力量、任何派别、任何知名人士一道前进，只要他们愿意在采取独立对外政策这一点上向前走一步，不管这一步是走得多么微小，多么动摇。
