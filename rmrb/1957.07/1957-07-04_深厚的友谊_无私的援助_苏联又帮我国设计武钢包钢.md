Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 3rd: After assisting China in the restoration, renovation, and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the Moscow Metallurgical Enterprise Design Institute is now helping China design Wuhan Iron and Steel Company and Baotou Iron and Steel Company.

    The overall preliminary design and technical design of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company have been completed, and construction design is currently underway. It is expected that all design work will be completed by next year. The overall preliminary design of Baotou Iron and Steel Company has been completed, and most of the technical design from the mine to public utilities will be delivered this year, with construction design to be completed in 1959.

    The design of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company began in 1954, and the design of Baotou Iron and Steel Company began in 1955. More than 20 Soviet design institutes participated in the various technical design works of these two companies. Before the design, the Soviet Union sent a large number of experts to China to conduct on-the-spot research and other pre-design preparations, and cooperated with Chinese experts in surveying and exploration.

    新华社莫斯科3日电　莫斯科冶金企业设计院在帮助中国设计鞍山钢铁公司的恢复、改建和新建工作完成以后，现在正在帮助中国设计武汉钢铁公司和包头钢铁公司。
    武汉钢铁公司的总体初步设计和技术设计都已完成，目前正在进行施工设计，预计到明年可以全部设计完成。包头钢铁公司的总体初步设计已经完成，从矿山到公用事业的技术设计大部分将在今年交清，施工设计将在1959年完成。
    武汉钢铁公司是1954年开始设计的，包头钢铁公司是在1955年开始设计的。参加这两个公司各项技术设计工作的有苏联的二十多个设计院。在设计之前，苏联曾派大批专家到中国来实地研究和进行设计前的其他准备工作，并且和中国专家配合进行测量勘察工作。
