Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 17th: Indian Defense Minister Krishna Menon arrived in Cairo early this morning from London.

Menon was passing through Cairo on his way back to India. At the airport, he told reporters that during his one or two-day stay in Cairo, he would discuss several issues with Egyptian President Nasser, including Anglo-Egyptian relations. He said he saw no reason why these relations should not be restored, and he personally hoped that these relations would return to normal.

Before leaving London, Menon had studied the results of the recent talks between Nasser and Nehru with British Prime Minister Macmillan.

    据新华社开罗17日电  印度国防部长克里希纳·梅农今天清晨从伦敦到达开罗。
