    Curbing Speculative Activities of Itinerant Peddlers
    Currently, the situation is very serious in various places where many itinerant peddlers are engaging in speculative activities by taking advantage of the insufficient supply of some commodities in the market and the imbalance in the distribution of certain goods. Examples include cornering the market on undershirts and vests, buying and selling cloth coupons, cornering the market on cotton cloth and ready-made clothing, snapping up graph paper, transporting and selling bicycles, wire nails, iron wire, small hardware for doors and windows, reselling coal, going deep into producing areas to drive up prices and抢购（qiang gou)抢购 state-unified procurement materials, and so on. In short, they snap up and corner the market on any commodity that is in short supply on the market, raise prices for transportation and sale, and seek exorbitant profits. For example, recently in Guangzhou, the supply of small hardware for doors and windows has been tight, and some Shanghai itinerant merchants, colluding with illegal brokers in the city, are peddling hinges to construction departments at twice the list price; the number of vendors in Shanghai engaged in cornering the market on saccharin has increased by about two times compared to January, with profits as high as 50%-100%; the black market price of iron wire in Yantai City is six times higher than the local list price. Some areas have even seen the emergence of cornering groups, carrying out large-scale speculative activities.
    Obviously, these illegal business activities of itinerant peddlers are increasing the tense atmosphere in the market and affecting price stability. Therefore, effective measures must be taken to curb these illegal itinerant peddlers' speculative cornering and troublemaking business activities.  ·Zhong Zhi·

    制止行商小贩的投机活动
    目前，各地不少行商小贩乘市场部分商品供应不足，和某些商品摆布不平衡，而进行投机活动的情况很严重。如套购汗衫背心、买卖布票、套购棉布和成装、抢购格线，贩运自行车、洋钉、铅丝、门窗小五金，倒卖煤炭，深入产地抬价抢购国家统一收购的物资等等。总之，凡是市场上供应紧张的商品，他们就到处抢购套购，抬价贩运，牟取暴利。例如近来广州门窗小五金供应紧张，有一些上海行商，勾结该市不法经纪人以高出牌价二倍的价格向建筑部门兜售铰链；上海从事套购糖精的商贩比1月约增加二倍，利润高达50％—100％；烟台市铁丝黑市价格高出当地牌价六倍。有些地区甚至出现套购集团，大肆进行投机活动。
    显然，这些行商小贩的不法经营活动，增加了市场的紧张空气，影响物价的稳定。因此，必须采取有效措施，制止这些不法行商小贩的投机套购、兴风作浪的经营活动。  ·忠直·
