I completely agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, and other national leaders. These reports fully demonstrate the achievements of our country's socialist revolution and construction, which are developing at an ever-increasing pace. These brilliant achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party, and we must realistically affirm these achievements first and foremost. However, the right-wing elements completely disregard the facts, depicting the great achievements of our socialist revolution and socialist construction as a complete mess. They viciously issued anti-Party and anti-socialist remarks, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, restore the heinous rule of the bourgeoisie, and re-enslave the people. This is something that the people of the whole country can never tolerate.

I have been engaged in water conservancy work in Sichuan for several years. I would like to briefly talk about the development of water conservancy in Sichuan in recent years, using ironclad facts to answer the right-wing elements' slander against the Party and the people.

Sichuan is located in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, with a warm climate (annual average temperature of 16°—20℃), abundant rainfall (annual rainfall averaging 1,000 mm), rich resources (rice, ramie, and oilseed hemp production all rank first in the country), and a large population (approximately 70 million people). It has long been known as the "Land of Abundance," and it truly deserves this reputation! It possesses abundant water resources. After our survey and measurement, we have selected water conservancy hubs such as the Three Gorges on the main stream of the Yangtze River, where the terrain and geology are suitable for building high dams. More than 20 water conservancy hubs have also been selected on the tributaries of the Jialing River, Min River, Jinsha River, and Wu River. The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, with the assistance of Soviet experts, is conducting a comprehensive river basin plan for the comprehensive utilization of Yangtze River water and land resources. The construction of these hubs will play a huge role in our country's flood control, power generation, irrigation, navigation, and other undertakings. There are more than 80 large and medium-sized tributaries of the Yangtze River in Sichuan, plus thousands of small rivers and streams, all of which contain endless water resources that can be fully utilized for our irrigation, power generation, navigation, and other undertakings. When I and Soviet experts went to Sichuan for several surveys, they said to us when they saw the Min River, Jialing River, Wu River, and other tributaries: "Don't treat them as ordinary tributaries. They are large rivers in themselves. The Yangtze River makes them look small. They have great potential power. Developing them will greatly benefit national construction." What was such a beautiful, fertile, and prosperous Sichuan like before liberation? Corruption, oppression and exploitation by local bullies, warlord infighting, and banditry ran rampant, leading to the bankruptcy of the countryside and the impoverishment of the people. The people lived a miserable life. As everyone knows, there is an old Chinese saying, "Food is the paramount necessity of the people." To improve people's lives, it is necessary to greatly increase grain production; to develop industry, it is necessary to increase the production of industrial raw materials. Water conservancy construction has the same decisive significance for increasing grain and industrial raw material production as fertilizer. I will give an example of water conservancy in Sichuan to illustrate the destruction of rural production before liberation.

According to statistics from recent decades, the irrigated area in the province before liberation not only did not increase, but even decreased. Many mass water conservancy projects were abandoned due to years of disrepair. The famous Dujiangyan project, known as a 3 million mu irrigation area, had an actual irrigated area of less than 2 million mu on the eve of liberation. Due to disrepair of water conservancy facilities, water and drought disasters became increasingly serious. The severe droughts of 1937 and 1940 were unprecedented in Sichuan's history.

In the few years since liberation, water conservancy construction in Sichuan Province has experienced unprecedented development. Seven years of bumper harvests have made great contributions to the state's overall arrangement and distribution of grain, and to the relief of the people in disaster-stricken provinces. In 1949, the irrigated area accounted for only 20 percent of the total paddy field area, totaling 11 million mu. By 1957, it had reached more than 36 million mu, ensuring irrigation for 64 percent of the existing paddy fields. In the past eight years, the irrigated area has increased by more than two times. In 1956 alone, 68,000 reservoirs, ponds, and dams, and 28,000 large and small canals were built, expanding the irrigated area by 10.03 million mu (including more than 1 million mu of dry land irrigation), which is almost equivalent to the total irrigated area in the decades before liberation. The ancient Dujiangyan irrigation area has also been reborn with the liberation of the people, and has played a role that it has never played in history. We have not only renovated the original irrigation canals and built new control equipment, but also expanded new irrigation areas such as the Guanqu Nian (more than 80 kilometers long, spanning more than a dozen rivers such as the Mengyang River and Xiaoshi River, with more than 700 large and small structures, irrigating an area of 1.29 million mu), the Xihua River (area of 840,000 mu), and the Dongshan River (area of 560,000 mu). At present, the irrigated area has expanded from 2 million mu in 1949 to 5.4 million mu, making the Chengdu Plain a true grain and oil production base where "people are free from water and drought and do not know hunger." In the past few years, in mountainous and hilly areas, we have adopted the method of public-private partnership, fully mobilizing and relying on the masses to build tens of thousands of ponds and reservoirs, greatly preventing and reducing the threat of water and drought disasters in these areas, and ensuring the steady rise of agricultural production. As a result of water conservancy construction, in 1956 and 1957 alone, the province increased the area of double-cropping rice by more than 8 million mu. In Langzhong, Nanbu, Cangxi and other places, there was no heavy rain for more than 40 days when the millet was budding last year, but because there were pond and water conservancy facilities for irrigation, the rice not only did not suffer from drought, but increased production compared to the previous year. In 1956, the Linjiang Commune in Yibin County built the Linjiang Weir, which enabled 82 percent of the commune's 950 mu of land to be planted with double-cropping rice, with an average yield of 705 jin per mu, an increase of more than 50 percent. The Chuandiba in Liujia Township, Nanxi County, is a low-lying area in the mountains, and water often does not recede for one or two months during the flood season. Before liberation, it was once flooded for half a year before the water receded, and there was no harvest. In the spring of 1956, under the leadership of the township branch, it took 45 days to complete six Hengshan Weirs, one water conveyance ditch, and two water elimination caves, enabling the Chuandiba, which had been flooded for years, to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest, increasing rice production by more than 14,000 jin.

Due to the completion of agricultural cooperation, due to the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects, combined with other agricultural measures, the increase in grain production in 1956 was significantly increased, an increase of 10 percent compared with 1955, an increase of 16.3 billion jin compared with 1949 before liberation, and an increase of 10.2 billion jin compared with 1938, the year with the highest historical output. In one year, 12 billion jin of commercial grain were supplied, supporting the country's socialist construction.

The farmland water conservancy work in Sichuan Province is carried out under the earnest implementation of the central government's principle of relying on the masses, adapting to local conditions, saving costs and achieving high efficiency. According to survey materials, the cost of materials for building mountain ponds and reservoirs is only one to two yuan per mu (according to the statistical materials of seven small reservoirs in Zizhong County, the average cost of materials per mu is 1.05 yuan), and ten to fifteen workdays are required. Even for the Guanqu Nian project, which irrigates an area of more than 1.3 million mu, the engineering cost per mu is only two yuan. The reason why the cost of farmland water conservancy projects in Sichuan Province is particularly low is mainly because it can adapt to local conditions, take materials locally, and fully mobilize the strength of the masses. For example, stone culverts, bamboo pipes, and wooden pipes, which are widely used in reservoir projects, are generally five to ten times cheaper than concrete pipes. In the Guanqu Nian project, the experience of local people is summarized, and pebbles are used in large quantities to build culverts, aqueducts, and water distribution structures. Under the premise of ensuring quality, the cost of engineering is generally saved by four to five times compared with reinforced concrete, and the construction period is greatly shortened, reducing the amount of steel and cement needed. For example, the use of folded gates, sector gates, and artificial cement on some projects has achieved the purpose of saving costs and achieving high efficiency.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient technical personnel, in recent years, the Provincial Water Conservancy Department and various special districts and counties have adopted methods such as carrying out demonstration projects, organizing visits and internships, and running short-term training classes to train more than 10,000 farmer water conservancy technicians, which has enriched the technical guidance force at the grassroots level and played a great role in carrying out work and ensuring quality.

The issue of project quality was the most debated issue in the previous stage. According to the recent on-site investigation, there are some shortcomings in our work, but according to the analysis of the survey materials, the projects that are truly of poor quality account for only 3 to 7 percent of the total number of projects; other shortcomings are caused by poor management and maintenance. For example, there are 69 ponds in Zhongnong Township, Renshou County. After on-site investigation and research, only four of them are of poor quality due to insufficient attention to design or construction, accounting for 5.8 percent of the total number of ponds; 40 of them have water leakage and landslides due to lack of management, or the person in charge is just a formality, resulting in poor maintenance, which needs to be strengthened. The township repaired 23 ponds last October, spending a total of 99 workdays, with an average of only 4.3 workdays per pond. For example, there are 115 ponds in Fenghuang Township, Zizhong County. After investigation, only three of them are of poor quality, accounting for 2.6 percent. For example, the investigation of 144 ponds in Jukui Township, Liangping County, showed that 118 of them are of good quality, accounting for 81.9 percent; 21 of them have some problems and need to be repaired, accounting for 14.6 percent; and five of them are of poor quality and play a very small role, accounting for 3.5 percent. Therefore, we have every reason to affirm that the achievements of water conservancy work in Sichuan Province in recent years are huge and major, and the shortcomings are individual.

Of course, we must not be satisfied with the existing achievements, and we must not ignore the shortcomings in our work. In the future, water conservancy work in Sichuan Province should pay special attention to the following points:

First, more than one-third of the province's paddy fields still lack irrigation facilities, and about half of the paddy fields with irrigation facilities have insufficient drought resistance. In particular, some of the smaller projects built in the past were mostly designed based on the amount of water infiltrated by one-season fields. At present, with the expansion of double-cropping rice and the expansion of the replanting area, the average water demand has increased by more than 30 percent, which requires new projects to supplement. Secondly, more than half of the cultivated land in Sichuan Province is planted with dry crops, which were rarely irrigated before. However, according to typical experiments in the past two years, the yield of cotton, wheat, and corn that have been irrigated is generally increased by about 20 percent, and some have reached more than 50 percent. There is still great potential for development in this area, and we should continue to implement the central government's water conservancy construction policy and actively carry out work.

Second, as long as water conservancy is guaranteed in Sichuan Province, there is still great potential to expand the replanting area, change to double-cropping and three-cropping crops, and irrigate dry land to increase the yield per unit area. It is estimated that during the second five-year plan, changing single-cropping rice to double-cropping rice by 10 million mu can increase production by 2 billion jin per year, changing dry land to paddy land by 4 million mu can increase production by 1 billion jin, irrigating dry land by 10 million mu can increase production by 700 million jin, and changing winter paddy fields to irrigated paddy fields, adding one season of small spring crops by 10 million mu can increase production by 1 billion jin; these four items alone can increase grain production by about 5 billion jin, which is an important measure to increase grain production.

Third, Sichuan Province has abundant rainfall and numerous rivers, but due to the terrain, the slopes are generally steep and the currents are rapid, and the water is low and the fields are high, so the utilization rate is not high. In the future, combining hydroelectric power generation with the development of mechanical water lifting irrigation is an important direction. According to survey materials, it is estimated that the hydropower reserves of the Min River, Jialing River, Wu River, and Yalong River alone reach more than 80 million kilowatts, and the medium and small rivers and irrigation canals suitable for developing rural hydropower stations have 450,000 kilowatts. These valuable water resources should be developed in a planned and step-by-step manner to benefit the people. In the next few years, according to the country's financial and material resources, some medium-sized and small hydropower stations and pumping stations can be built first. At the same time, special attention should be paid to combining production, strengthening management, and reducing costs. For example, the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative Hydropower Station in Anle Township, Chongqing County, was built in 1956 with a power generation capacity of 10 kilowatts. Because it adapted to local conditions and took materials locally, the cost of building the station was greatly reduced. The dam of this power station is made of bamboo cage pebbles, the water turbine is made of wood, the power poles are made of old materials, the fuel is partially replaced by raw trees, and the factory building is built using dismantled old house materials. The entire project investment is 1,362.9 yuan. Excluding the labor of the cooperative members and self-raised equipment, the actual expenditure is only 431 yuan (320 yuan for the generator is not included). In the process of building the station, they adopted the method of milling rice first and then generating electricity, using the water turbine to directly drive the rice milling. In two months, the net increase in income was 1,435 yuan, not including the income of the cooperative members for loading and unloading grain for the grain depot of 579 yuan, and the income of the female cooperative members for weaving linen for the supply and marketing cooperative under the electric lights. They have also successively added electric weeding machines, flour milling machines, etc. this year. At the same time, the effect of saving oil for the cooperative's lighting is also great, which is worth promoting.

Fourth, how to do a good job in the management and maintenance of the existing more than 30 million mu of projects is also an important issue at present. First of all, the grassroots organizational structure should be enriched. In any case, it is necessary to ensure that all projects, regardless of size, have dedicated personnel to manage them, and can conduct regular inspections, repairs, and maintenance in order to ensure the normal use of the projects. The agricultural cooperatives' water management personnel and the water conservancy committee's full-time cadres should be strengthened in political education, technical leadership, and other methods in order to fully发挥 their enthusiasm in their work. In recent years, Sichuan Province has also made some achievements in the work of new methods of soaking fields and rational irrigation, but it is still limited to key areas and has not been fully promoted. In the future, attention should be paid to organizing and promoting the work.

Fifth, the situation of soil erosion in some areas of Sichuan Province is quite serious. The general coverage situation is: the surrounding mountains are better, the deep hilly areas are second, and the central area is the worst. In Suining, Jiangjin, Wenjiang, Nanchong, Neijiang and other special districts, the hillsides have been extensively reclaimed and a lot of trees have been cut down, resulting in serious soil erosion, which not only seriously affects local agricultural production, but also is extremely detrimental to the service life of downstream reservoirs. In Sanxing Township, Jintang County, before soil and water conservation work was carried out, the average annual yield of sloping land in the township was only 150 jin per mu, and the small spring crops were all potholed and there was no harvest. If there was a heavy rain, it would also form a flood disaster, and even the lowest yield could not be guaranteed. The township began to carry out soil and water conservation in 1952, and the sloping land was changed to terraced fields, which improved the drought resistance and fertilizer retention capacity of the land, and increased production by more than 100 jin per mu. However, in the past few years, soil and water conservation work in Sichuan Province has been limited to the key experimental stage, and should be gradually promoted to the surface in the future.

Please criticize and correct the above opinions.

    把四川水利的巨大潜力开发出来
    陈离的发言
    我完全同意周恩来总理、李先念副总理、薄一波副总理以及其他各位国家领导同志的报告，这些报告完全证明我们国家社会主义革命和建设的成就，还在一日千里的发展。这些辉煌的成就是和共产党的领导分不开的，我们必须实事求是首先把成绩肯定下来。而右派分子却完全抹煞事实，把我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，描绘得一团漆黑。他们恶毒的发出了反党、反社会主义的言论，妄图推翻共产党的领导，恢复万恶的资产阶级的统治，重新奴役人民，这是全国人民决不能容忍的。
    我在四川搞了几年水利工作，我想简要的谈一谈几年来四川水利方面的发展情况，用铁一般的事实来回答右派分子对党、对人民的诽谤。
    四川位于长江上游，气候温暖（年平均温度16°—20℃），雨量丰沛（年雨量平均一千公厘），物产丰富（水稻、苎麻、油麻的产量均占全国的第一位），人口众多（约七千万人），古称天府之国，确实名不虚传！它蕴藏着很丰富的水利资源，经我们查勘测量在长江干流上选择有地形地质适宜于筑高坝的有三峡等水利枢纽；在支流的嘉陵江、岷江、金沙江、乌江亦选有二十多个水利枢纽。长江水利委员会在苏联专家们帮助下，正在作长江水利和土地资源综合利用的流域规划，这些枢纽兴建，将对我国防洪、发电、灌溉、航运等事业起着巨大的作用。长江在四川境内的大中支流共有八十多条，加上小河山溪，数以千计，都蕴藏着无穷无尽的水利资源，可以供我们灌溉、发电、航运等事业充分利用。我和苏联专家们几次到四川查勘时，他们看到岷江、嘉陵江、乌江等支流向我们说：“你们不要把它们当着一般支流看待，它们本身就是一条大河流，被长江把它们形容小了，它们潜在着很大的力量，开发出来，大大有利于国家建设。”这样美丽、肥沃、富庶的四川，在解放前怎样？贪污，土劣压迫剥削，军阀混战，土匪横行，弄得农村破产，民不聊生。人民过着惨痛生活。大家知道，中国有句老话，“民以食为天”，要改善人民生活，必须大量增产粮食；要发展工业，必须增产工业原料。水利建设对粮食和工业原料的增产，与肥料同样具有决定性的意义。解放前，农村生产破坏情形，我举出四川水利的例子来说一下。
    根据近几十年的统计，解放前全省的灌溉面积，不但没有增加，而且还有减退，很多群众性的水利工程，因多年失修而被荒废。著名的都江堰工程，号称三百万亩的灌区，在解放前夕，实灌面积不及二百万亩。由于水利失修，水旱灾害，日趋严重，一九三七年、一九四○年的大旱，为患之烈，是四川历史上罕见的。
    解放后几年来，四川省的水利建设，有了空前的发展，七年的丰收对国家统筹支配粮食，救济灾区省份人民有了极大的贡献。在一九四九年灌溉面积才占全部水田面积的百分之二十，计一千一百万亩，到一九五七年已达到三千六百余万亩，使现有水田的百分之六十四都有了灌溉保证。八年来，灌溉面积增长了两倍以上，仅一九五六年一年就修建了水库、塘、坝六万八千座，大小渠道二万八千条，扩大灌溉面积一千零三万亩（其中包括旱地浇灌一百余万亩），差不多相当于解放前几十年灌溉面积的总和。古老的都江堰灌区，也随着人民的解放获得了新生，发挥了它历史上从来没有发挥过的作用。我们不但将原灌溉渠进行了整修，修建了新式的节制设备，而且扩建了官渠埝（全长八十多公里，横跨蒙阳河、小石河等十余道河流，大小建筑物七百余座，灌溉面积一百二十九万亩），西河（面积八十四万亩）、东山（面积五十六万亩）等新的灌区。目前灌溉面积已由一九四九年的二百万亩扩大到五百四十万亩，使成都平原真正成为“水旱从人，不知饥馑”的粮食和油料基地。几年来，我们在山区、丘陵地区采取民办公助、充分发动和依靠群众的办法，修建了数以万计的水塘、水库，大大防止和减轻了这些地区水旱灾害的威胁，保证了农业生产的稳定上升。由于兴修水利的结果，仅一九五六、一九五七两年，全省即增加了双季稻面积八百余万亩，阆中、南部、苍溪等地去年谷子含苞时，有四十多天没有下过透雨，但因有了塘堰水利设施，进行灌溉，水稻不但没有受旱，反而比前年增产了。宜宾县临江社一九五六年修了临江堰，使全社九百五十亩田有百分之八十二种上了双季稻，平均每亩产量达到七百零五斤，增产百分之五十以上，南溪县刘家乡川底坝是块山间洼地，每逢洪水季节，积水常常一两个月不退，解放前曾经有一次淹没了半年，积水才退，颗粒无收。一九五六年春，在乡支部的领导下，以四十五天的时间完成了横山堰六个，输水沟一条，消水洞二个，使连年被淹的川底坝，获得了空前的丰收，增产了稻米一万四千余斤。
    由于农业合作化的完成，由于大规模的兴修水利，结合其他农业措施，使一九五六年的粮食增产量有了显著的增长，比一九五五年增加了百分之十，比解放前的一九四九年增加了一百六十三亿斤，比历史上的最高产量年份一九三八年增加了一百零二亿斤。一年中，供应了商品粮一百二十亿斤，支援了国家的社会主义建设。
    四川省的农田水利工作是在认真贯彻中央的依靠群众，因地制宜，费省效宏的原则下进行的。根据调查材料，修建山塘及水库，每亩负担材料费不过一至二元（根据资中县七个小型水库的统计材料，平均每亩负担材料费为一元零五分），出工十至十五个劳动日。即以灌溉面积达一百三十余万亩的官渠埝工程，每亩负担工程费也不过两元。四川省农田水利工程造价，所以特别低的原因，主要是能够因地制宜，就地取材，充分发动群众力量的缘故。如在水库工程中，普遍推广的石卧管、竹管和木管，一般要比混凝土管便宜五倍到十倍。管渠埝工程中，总结当地群众经验，大量采用卵石修建涵洞、渡槽、分水建筑物，在保证质量的前提下，一般较用钢筋混凝土节省工程费用四、五倍，而且大大的缩短工期，减少了钢材、水泥需要的数量。又如在一些工程上采用折折式闸门，扇形闸门以及人造水泥等都达到了费省效宏的目的。
    为了解决技术干部不足的问题，几年来省水利厅和各专、县采取搞示范工程，组织参观、实习，办短期训练班等方式培养农民水利技术员一万余人，充实了基层的技术指导力量，对开展工作，保证质量，起到很大作用。
    关于工程质量问题，是前一阶段争论最多的问题，根据最近实地调查的情况来看，我们工作中是有些缺点的，但根据调查材料的分析，真正属于质量不好的占总工程数的百分之三到百分之七；其它一些缺点，是由于管理养护不善等原因所造成。如仁寿中农乡共有圹六十九口，经实地调查研究，其中由于设计或施工注意不够，确实质量低劣的仅四口，占总圹数的百分之五点八；由于无人管理，或者有专人而流于形式，以致养护不好，造成漏水，滑坡的有四十口，需要加强管养。该乡去年十月已整好二十三口，共花工九十九个，平均每圹仅花工四点三个。又如资中凤凰乡共有圹一百一十五口，经调查后，其中确实质量不好的，只有三口，占百分之二点六。又如梁平县巨奎乡一百四十四口圹的调查，质量好的一百一十八口，占百分之八十一点九；有些问题，需要整修的二十一口，占百分之十四点六；质量低劣，发挥作用很小的五口，占百分之三点五。因之我们完全有理由肯定，四川省几年来水利工作成绩是巨大的，是主要的，而缺点是个别的。
    当然，我们决不能满足已有的成就，也更不能忽视工作中存在的缺点，今后四川省的水利工作，应特别注意以下几点：
    一、当前全省还有三分之一以上的稻田没有灌溉设施，而已有灌溉设施的水田中，约有半数抗旱能力不足，特别是以前所修的一部分较小工程，原来多系根据一季田渗水设计水量，目前随着双季稻的扩展，复种面积的扩大，需水量平均要增加百分之三十以上，这就需要有新的工程来补充。其次，四川省半数以上的耕地是种植旱作物的，这些作物以前是很少进行灌溉的。但根据近两年来的典型试验，一般浇灌过的棉花、小麦、玉米要增产百分之二十左右，有的达到百分之五十以上，这方面发展的潜力还很大，应当继续贯彻中央的水利建设方针，积极进行。
    二、四川省只要水利获得保证，扩大复种面积，改种双季、三季作物以及旱地灌溉以提高单位面积产量的潜力还很大，估计第二个五年计划期间单季稻改双季稻一千万亩，每年即可增产二十亿斤，旱地改水地四百万亩，可增产十亿斤；旱地水浇一千万亩，可增产七亿斤；冬水田改灌溉水田，加种一季小春一千万亩，可增产十亿斤；仅这四项合计就可增产粮食五十亿斤左右，这是增加粮食产量的一项重要措施。
    三、四川省雨量丰富，河流众多，但由于地形关系，一般是坡陡流急，水低田高，利用率不高，今后结合水力发电发展机械提水灌溉是一个重要方向。据调查材料估计仅岷江、嘉陵江、乌江、雅垅江水力储藏量即达八千余万瓩，而中小型河流及灌溉渠道中适于发展农村水电站的就有四十五万瓩，这些宝贵的水利资源，应当有计划、有步骤地开发出来为人民造福。在最近几年内，根据国家的财力和物力条件，可以先搞一些中型和小型的水电站和抽水机站，同时应特别注意结合生产，加强管理，降低成本。如崇庆县安乐乡胜利农业社水电站，一九五六年建站，发电量十瓩，由于因地制宜，就地取材，大大的降低了建站费用，这个电站的拦河坝是用竹笼卵石作的，水轮机是木制的，电杆是用旧料，烧料由部分生树代替，厂房利用拆的旧屋料修建，整个工程投资为一千三百六十二元九角，除去社员出工和自筹器材外，实际现在开支只有四百三十一元（发电机三百二十元未包括在内），他们在建站过程中，采取先打米后发电的方式，利用水轮机直接带动打米，两个月时间，就净增益一千四百三十五元，而社员替粮库装卸搬运粮食的收入五百七十九元，以及女社员在电灯下替供销社织麻线的收入还不在内，他们今年还陆续添置电动锄草机、磨面机等，同时对合作社照明省油的效用亦大，是值得提倡的。
    四、如何作好现有的三千多万亩工程的管理养护工作，也是当前一个重要问题，首先应当充实基层的组织机构，无论如何要作到不论大小工程都有专人管理，能够经常进行检查，修补，保养，才能保证工程的正常使用。对于农业合作社管水人员和水利委员会管理处的脱产干部，应当加强政治教育、技术领导和其他办法，以充分发挥他们在工作中的积极性。新法泡田和合理灌溉工作，近两年来，四川省也作出了一些成绩，不过还限于重点地方，没有全面推广，今后要注意组织推广工作。
    五、四川省部分地区水土流失情况相当严重。一般复盖情况是：周围大山较好，深丘陵地区次之，而腹心地区最差。在遂宁、江津、温江、南充、内江等专区，山坡被大量开垦，树木砍伐特多，水土流失情况相当严重，不但严重影响当地农业生产，而且对下游水库使用寿命极为不利。金堂县三星乡在未进行水土保持工作前，全乡坡地每亩平均年产量仅一百五十斤，小春全是坑地，颗粒无收，如稍遇大雨，还会形成洪灾，连最低产量也难保证。全乡从一九五二年开始进行水土保持，坡地改梯地，提高了土地的抗旱保肥能力，每亩增产一百斤以上。不过几年来四川省水土保持工作，还限于重点试验阶段，今后应当逐步的向面上推广。
    以上意见，请各代表批评指正。
