I now, with a heavy heart, confess my problems before all the representatives, honestly admit my mistakes, and resolve to strengthen my studies in the future, thoroughly transform myself, and forever follow the Communist Party. However, due to my low political level and confused thoughts, my self-criticism is not deep enough. I earnestly request all representatives to continue to criticize and help me.

First, I want to supplement the exposure of Luo Longji's crimes beyond what I discussed in the Sichuan delegation and the China Democratic League.

I have known Luo Longji since childhood, having been classmates for many years. Recalling everything about him in the past, I realize that he is indeed a greedy and insatiable ambitious person who specializes in sectarianism. Just listing the following things can illustrate this problem:

	1. He often boasts about "eight years at Tsinghua, three times running for school president." When he was studying at Tsinghua, he was known for organizing small groups to engage in student activities. As a result, he was in the limelight and became the president of the student union, which initially cultivated his political ambition and desire to be a leader.

	2. During his study in the United States, he organized some believers in nationalism to form the Da Jiang Society and made himself the president of the Chinese Students' Association in the United States.

	3. After returning to China, in addition to participating in the National Socialist Party, he also contacted the Youth Party, but he terminated the relationship because he could not climb to a leadership position.

	4. When he started working for the China Democratic League in Kunming, he formed a small circle. At that time, he specially contacted several Tsinghua classmates and Youth Party members (including Pan Guangdan, Zeng Zhaolun, Fei Xiaotong, and me, as well as Youth Party members Tang Xiaoting, Yang Yishi, Zheng Dudu, etc.) and opposed the progressive elements in the League. Therefore, his faction should be said to have been reorganized since 1950, not started.

	5. During the War of Resistance in the first provisional representative assembly of the China Democratic League in Chongqing, he united League members with and without party affiliations to fight against the Youth Party, but his purpose of fighting was not for anything else, but to seize the position of Secretary-General from Zuo Shunsheng (leader of the Youth Party).

	6. In the early days of liberation, he failed to obtain a position like Zhang Bojun and Shi Liang. He thought that the Party did not value him because his political capital was too small. Therefore, at that time (1950), he tried to pull in as many people as possible, whether they were professors or League members who were frustrated in other areas.

	7. At the Seventh Plenary Session, he obtained the position of Vice-Chairman, which satisfied part of his temporary desires, but he still regretted not obtaining a ministerial position.

	8. Last year, after he obtained the position of Minister of Forestry Industry, he complained that it did not conform to his expertise; and he also thought it was just standing in the ranks, only slightly higher than a supporting role.

	9. This spring, he analyzed the international situation and the issue of intellectuals to Wang Zaoshi, attempting to use Wang Zaoshi in Shanghai to promote him, to cater to the backward psychology of intellectuals in order to rally the masses and raise his prestige.

	10. From the above, his taste has become higher and higher, and the circle has become larger and larger. On the common position of being anti-Soviet, anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist, he colluded with Zhang Bojun, whom he had regarded as an enemy in the past, and became a close comrade-in-arms. The Zhang-Luo alliance was thus formed, thinking that his political capital had expanded, not only could he bargain with the Party, but also wanted to confront the Party on an equal footing. This shows that Luo Longji is a sectarian who specializes in forming small circles, and at the same time, an insatiable ambitious person.

In addition, he is also a schemer who only seeks personal interests, disregards national interests, and has always been anti-Soviet and anti-communist. He vainly attempts to change our country's one-sided foreign policy line to a pro-American and anti-Soviet line. In my dealings with him, I know that he has the following views:

	1. During the US imperialist invasion of Korea, he and Zhang Dongsun both believed that it was not necessarily Li Chengran who launched the war first.

	2. He agreed with Tito and Kardelj's views on the Hungarian incident, believing that the Soviet Union was interfering in Hungary's internal affairs.

	3. He believed that after Britain and France invaded Egypt, the war did not escalate because the United States exerted pressure, which caused Britain and France to stop the invasion.

Based on the above points, he concluded that international public opinion is giving higher and higher evaluations of US President Eisenhower, and trust in the Soviet Union and the peace and democracy camp is getting smaller and smaller (he said that the number of Communist Party members in Britain, the United States, and France who are leaving the party is increasing day by day, and Wen Youzhang is unwilling to attend the World Peace Council). The international situation is not easing, and the liberation of Taiwan is not easy, etc., absurd rumors. In addition, he also said that the Beria incident was just a factional dispute within the Soviet Communist Party, and he had foreseen the downfall of Malenkov long ago. After the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, he felt that his past speech at Stalin's death, without emotion, was justified. This shows that not only is he ideologically opposed to the Soviet Union and the Party's peaceful foreign policy, but he is also emotionally anti-Soviet.

Why does he have all the above ideas? This shows that not only are his opinions basically the opinions of US imperialism, but his thoughts and feelings are also consistent with US imperialism. Before liberation, in addition to contacting Stuart Lei Deng and Wedemeyer, he also often interacted with US embassy staff Park Laos and the US consul in Kunming, and often handed over internal documents of the League to them. After liberation, he also frequently read American magazines, and he actually used these imperialist viewpoints as his "diplomatic program." From this, it can be seen that his opposition to the Soviet Union and opposition to the Communist Party's peaceful foreign policy is consistent. As for his attitude of resistance to the Party's domestic policy, it is also very obvious, such as his exaggerating the progress of intellectuals and ignoring the transformation of intellectuals; emphasizing the deviations of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, advocating the establishment of a rehabilitation committee; criticizing the Communist Party for developing too much, advocating the great development of democratic parties, etc., fallacies have already been criticized by everyone, so there is no need to say more.

Secondly, I want to review how I participated in and carried out the sectarian conspiracies of the Zhang-Luo alliance.

Luo Longji's formation of an invisible organization of small factions within the League started in Kunming, and at that time, it was in opposition to the left-wing elements in the League. By 1950, it had developed slightly (the central figures included Zhang Dongsun, Pan Guangdan, Zeng Zhaolun, Fei Xiaotong, Ye Duyi, Zhang Zhihe, Fan Puzhai, etc., and the local figures included Ma Zhemin, Peng Wenyin, Chen Renbing, Zhao Wenbi, Wang Wenguang, Li Dejia, Zhang Songtao, and me), and began to compete with Zhang Bojun for leadership. At that time, I was dissatisfied with my work arrangement, and he encouraged me to form a faction in Sichuan to oppose Chu Tunan. Later, after the Southwest Administrative Region was abolished, the League Central Committee intended to transfer me to work in Beijing, but Luo Longji firmly opposed it, refusing to withdraw from his so-called base, and used the argument that I was a local leader in the Southwest and a full-time cadre in the Central Committee to cater to my backward thinking, so that I would serve him in Sichuan.

After 1951, the form of the faction changed. Zhang and Luo also cooperated in recent years. The current method is: first, from collective to individual or a few people's contact, exchanging opinions; second, insisting on their views through meetings (such as the large-scale airing of views and development at this spring's work conference, views on the issue of intellectuals, etc.); third, through the secret consultations between Zhang and Luo (such as their consultations in Beidaihe last year, and the decisions of the four working committees this spring), and then deploying their plans.

The conspiracy of the Zhang-Luo alliance is to use the backward part of intellectuals as their political capital to confront the Party, and the method adopted is to deliberately distort and convey information, or use their position to issue seemingly correct messages; they sometimes use the name of legitimate organizations, sometimes use private invitations for tea and meals to chat, or talk a lot, or say a few words, in short, nothing more than spreading poison, indulging themselves, and confusing others. In this way, all those who have closer contact with them have been deeply affected by them (of course, those who are affected must have a common ideological foundation with them). Some opinions are even regarded as the correct instructions of the organization, and they unconsciously carry out work in the direction of their conspiracy. I am one of those who participated in their faction and conspiracy of this nature, and I also responded to Zhang and Luo's advocacy in Sichuan, influencing the cadres and League members in Sichuan. Therefore, I played the most negative leading role in igniting the fire in the rectification campaign, making a mess of the Sichuan League. I should take the blame.

How did I carry out Zhang and Luo's conspiracy in Sichuan? After the sixteen-character policy of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, letting a hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, Zhang and Luo both thought that the League's future status and role would greatly change, and they were much more energetic than before; they became particularly interested in the Sichuan League, thinking that there was great potential to be tapped there, especially wanting to win over the masses in the cultural and educational circles, attempting to break away from the leadership of the Party, so as to confront the Party. Therefore, when they proposed the political design institute, I proposed in Sichuan that members of democratic parties must participate in construction design in schools, that playing cards should not only be dreaming, and that the legs of the table should not be missing one, etc., absurd proposals, simply forgetting the provisions of the Constitution, that the Party is the core leader of the people of the whole country; without the leadership of the Party, it is impossible to build socialism. What is this kind of rhetoric that attempts to confront the Party and be on an equal footing with it if it is not anti-Party and anti-socialist?

Since Zhang and Luo have such ambitions in politics, their organizational line is to greatly expand. Luo Longji criticized Sichuan for developing too few League members, far less than other places. I also earnestly implemented his proposal in Sichuan, focusing on voluntary participation, breaking the three main boundaries, and emphasizing the development of youth, middle, and backward elements, hoping to improve the League's prestige by daring to criticize the Party in the large-scale airing of views, so as to facilitate the absorption of members; therefore, it was advocated that the development procedures could be relaxed, whether it was a flowing stream or small and medium-sized cities, there was no need to restrict them. Because I was criticized by Luo Longji, I greatly praised the local organizations that had developed more, such as Chongqing, and expressed dissatisfaction with those that had developed less, such as Chengdu; I also suspected that Tian Yiping was not very interested in developing the organization, and blamed the United Front Department for not supporting the development of the organization.

When Luo Longji came to Chengdu last year to inspect issues related to intellectuals, he consulted with me and held several forums, interviewing some people. The purpose was nothing more than: one was to cheer up the League cadres, saying that the League had a future and that the organization should be greatly developed; the other was to collect deviations in the implementation of the policy on intellectuals, so he paid special attention to the letters from old intellectuals who had been criticized. This became one of the bases for his later proposal to establish a rehabilitation committee; when he passed through Chengdu Airport this spring, he greatly praised his opinions as being well-raised, praised Chu Anping for speaking well, and said that Shi Liang and Li Zhonggong's opinions were very bad. This clearly shows that those who attack the Party are good, and those who support the Party are bad, and it is enough to show that he is deliberately anti-Party and anti-people. His malicious intentions are more than that. The motive of explaining these opinions to me was to use me to convey this meaning to the cadres of the Sichuan League and others, so as to realize his conspiracy of setting fires everywhere.

In my work methods in the League, since the "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" policy was put forward, I have been interested in organizational independence and political freedom; I especially emphasized consultation with the United Front Department, but making decisions on my own. Therefore, the League itself often made decisions on the League's work arrangements and personnel adjustments, and only told the United Front Department afterwards. I emphasized that accepting the Party's leadership was on the level of principles and policies, and only reported on major issues, so I adopted the approach that the relationship with the Party was not getting closer and closer, but the distance was getting farther and farther. This also shows that I firmly implemented Zhang and Luo's approach of breaking away from the Party's leadership and doing things on my own. Not only that, I also slandered the Sichuan Party leadership, attempting to provoke the unity between the Party and the Party, and between the Party and the masses, vainly attempting to weaken the Party's prestige and raise the League's status. This is a complete example of the bad style of Anglo-American bourgeois political parties.

On the issue of intellectuals, I completely accepted the opinions of Luo Longji and Fei Xiaotong. Therefore, when I made the transmission in Chengdu, I only publicized the proposals of the two of them and ignored the opinions of Hu Yuzhi and Chu Tunan. I also exaggerated the deviations in "suppressing counter-revolutionaries" and "ideological reform." Therefore, I not only responded to Luo Longji's rehabilitation committee, but even developed its scope and content. On the issue of the school Party committee system, I uncritically accepted Zhang Bojun's erroneous transmission, and also followed suit by saying that the Party committee system had brought some losses to the school in the past, and therefore advocated expert management of the school. In the airing of views, I emphasized the progress of intellectuals, and that all problems are basically contradictions among the people. Therefore, I advocated the airing of views without any standards; I even said that the spirit of airing views should not be limited to academics, but can also be applied to politics; mutual supervision should not be limited to organizations, and individuals can also play a supervisory role, etc. absurdities. The above shows that I am no different from Zhang and Luo in openly resisting the Party's leadership and opposing the Party's policies. Now I realize that this is a very serious mistake that violates the Constitution, is anti-Party, and anti-people.

Finally, I want to deeply examine the root of my erroneous thinking. Now I realize that my anti-Party and anti-socialist thoughts are by no means accidental, but consistent, and not simply influenced by Zhang and Luo's thoughts, but that their thoughts aroused resonance with me, that is to say, my ideological essence and roots have a common foundation with them, so their proposals coincided with me.

I was born into a landlord family, and went to Tsinghua to study at the age of fourteen, and began to receive American imperialist education until I returned to China at the age of twenty-seven. This shows that I have been poisoned by American imperialist bourgeois education for a long time. During my studies in the United States, my political tendencies were also very backward. I often stayed with classmates who had nationalistic beliefs at that time (Wang Zaoshi and Peng Wenyin were very close to me). In 1927, when the Ninghan split occurred, I advocated that overseas students in the United States did not need to express any left or right leanings. After returning to China in 1930, I accepted the invitation of the two elders Chu Fucheng and Shen Junru and taught at the Shanghai Law School, where I peddled ideas such as Anglo-American democratic politics and reformist middle roads. At that time, teaching in private universities compared to national universities, the treatment was very poor, and life was also more difficult, so I had an added layer of dissatisfaction with the Kuomintang. When the anti-Japanese national salvation movement started, I participated in the National Salvation Association, but I still had more contact with Wang Zaoshi. I joined the China Democratic League in Kunming during the War of Resistance, and at that time I often interacted with Luo Longji. Judging from the above situation, the roots of my right-leaning thoughts are very deep, and I have many right-leaning friends. Since liberation, except for the land reform, I have not participated well in other various movements. Although my living status is much better than before liberation in all aspects, my ideological consciousness is still stuck on the old foundation, and all the remnants of bourgeois old democracy are still deeply entrenched and lurking. My outlook on life has changed little, and my ideological progress has been slow, so that once these germs encounter a suitable opportunity, they unknowingly emerge and endanger the people. In the rectification campaign, I did not conduct benevolent criticism from the standpoint of the people. Now I realize this mistake, which makes me feel very ashamed and heartbroken.

Recently, my son and niece (one is a member of the Communist Youth League and the other is a member of the Communist Party) both wrote from the Northeast and Wuhan respectively, expressing regret and indignation. They both said that the Party and the people have treated me well, and that life is many times better than in the Kuomintang era (I myself know that if I had not been liberated in 1949, not only would I not be able to live, but my life would be difficult to save). It is really unexpected that people who participated in the democratic revolution in the past would actually be so anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist today. Recently, my two younger sons (both of whom are still in primary school in Chengdu) heard that I am a rightist and they did not understand the meaning of this term. They went around asking people, damaging their young and innocent hearts. When I think of them, I cannot help but feel very sad. When I think of the Party and the people's continuous cultivation, education, and emphasis on me over the past few years, and I went so insane as to disregard all the consequences and issued fallacies that violated the Constitution, damaged socialism, and undermined Party-masses unity, it makes me even more heartbroken. I not only acted as a spokesperson for backward elements, but also supported counter-revolutionaries and played a role in setting fires everywhere. Am I still worthy of being a people's representative?

I am now determined to correct my past mistakes and start a new life. Today's self-criticism is not comprehensive and in-depth enough, and I must continue to thoroughly confess. I now sincerely admit my guilt to the people and resolutely break with the Zhang-Luo alliance, and forever follow the Communist Party on the socialist road.

    我承认错误
    潘大逵的发言
    我现在以沉痛的心情当着全体代表面前，老老实实地交代我的问题，诚诚恳恳地承认我的错误，决心今后加强学习，彻底改造自己，永远跟着共产党走。但由于我的政治水平低，现在的思想乱，检讨不够深入，还恳求各位代表不断批评和帮助。
    首先，我要对罗隆基的罪行除了我在四川代表小组和民盟谈过的以外，还要作一些补充的揭发。
    我与罗隆基从小同学，熟识多年，回忆起他过去的一切，才认识到他的的确确是一个得寸进尺，欲望无穷，专搞宗派的野心家。只要列举下面几件事，就可以说明这个问题。
    1、他常以“八年清华，三赶校长”而自鸣得意。在清华读书时，他就以组织小集团搞学生活动出名，结果他出了风头，当上了学生会会长，这就初步培养了他的政治野心，想当领袖的欲望。
    2、在美国留学时期，他把一些国家主义信仰者组织起来，成立大江学会，并使他自己当上了中国留美学生会会长。
    3、回国后，他除了参加国社党外，亦曾与青年党接洽过，但因不能爬到领导地位而终止。
    4、他在昆明开始搞民盟工作的时候，就搞小圈子，那时他特别联络几个清华同学和青年党党员（其中有潘光旦、曾昭抡、费孝通和我，另外有青年党党员唐小蓂、杨怡士、郑独步等），而与盟内进步分子闹对立，所以他的小宗派应该说从一九五○年起改组，而不是开始。
    5、抗战中在重庆民盟第一次临时代表大会中，他联合起有党派和无党派的盟员对青年党作斗争，但他斗争的目的不是为了别的，而是为了夺取左舜生（青年党领袖）的秘书长地位。
    6、解放初期，他未能得到如章伯钧和史良一样的地位。他以为党对他不重视，是因为他的政治资本太小，所以他就在那时（一九五○年）尽可能的多拉一些人，无论是教授或在其他方面失意的盟员。
    7、七中全会他得到了副主席的地位，满足了他部分的一时的欲望，但仍以未得到部长职位为憾。
    8、去年他得到森林工业部部长位置以后，又以不符合于他的专长而口出怨言；而且还以为不过是排朝站班，比跑龙套的角色稍高一级而已。
    9、今年春他又对王造时分析国际形势、知识分子问题，企图利用王造时在上海为他作宣传，以迎合知识分子落后心理为自己拉群众，抬高声望。
    10、从以上看来，他的口味就越来越高，圈子越搞越大，在反苏、反党、反人民、反社会主义的共同立场上，就把过去视若敌人的章伯钧勾结成为亲密的战友。章罗联盟就因此形成，满以为政治资本扩大了，不但可与党讲价钱，而且要想与党分庭抗礼了。这就可以说明罗隆基是一个专搞小圈子的宗派主义者，同时又是一个永不知足的野心家。
    此外，他还是一个只图个人利益，不顾国家利益，一贯反苏反共的阴谋者。他妄想改变我国的一边倒的外交路线，转为亲美反苏的路线，在我与他的来往中，我知道他有下面的一些看法：
    1、美帝侵朝时，他与张东荪都认为首先发动战争的不一定是李承晚。
    2、他同意铁托、卡德尔对匈牙利事件的看法，认为苏联是干涉匈牙利内政。
    3、他认为英法侵略埃及后，由于美国施加压力，致使英法停止侵略，战争才没有大打起来。
    根据上面几点，他得出结论，是国际舆论对美国艾森豪威尔的评价越来越高，对苏联与和平民主阵营的信任越来越小（他说英美法共产党员退党者日多，文幼章都不愿出席世界和平理事会）。国际局势并非日趋缓和，台湾解放不易等等谰言。此外，他还说过贝利亚事件不过是苏共系派之争，马林科夫下台，他早有预见。苏共二十次代表大会后，他觉得他过去在斯大林逝世时的讲话，没有感情是应该的了。这可见他不但在思想上反苏反党的和平外交政策，而且在感情上也是反苏的了。
    为甚么他有以上一切思想呢？这说明他的意见不但基本上是美帝意见，而且他的思想感情也是与美帝一致的。解放前他除了与司徒雷登、魏德迈等有接触外，在昆时与美使馆人员朴劳斯及美领事等亦经常来往，并常将盟的内部文件交给他们。解放后，他亦经常阅读美国杂志，而他竟把这些美帝观点作为他的“外交纲领”，从此可见他反对苏联、反对共产党的和平外交政策是一贯的，至于他对党的内政方针采取反抗的态度，也是很明显的，如他夸大知识分子的进步，忽略知识分子的改造；强调肃反的偏差，主张设立平反委员会；批评共产党发展太多，主张民主党派大发展等等谬论，早已被大家批驳，就不用多说了。
    其次，我要对我自己如何参加、执行章罗联盟的宗派阴谋加以检讨。
    罗隆基在盟内搞无形组织的小宗派是从昆明开始的，在那时是与盟内左派分子闹对立。到了一九五○年略有发展（中央的人有张东荪、潘光旦、曾昭抡、费孝通、叶笃义、张志和、范朴斋等，地方上有马哲民、彭文应、陈仁炳、赵文璧、王文光、李德家、张松涛和我等人），开始与章伯钧争领导。我当时不满意我的工作的安排，他就鼓励我在四川搞一宗派与楚图南对立起来，后来西南大行政区撤销，盟中央有意调我到京工作，罗隆基则坚决反对，不肯撤离他所谓的据点，并以我在西南是地方领导，到中央是专职干部的说法来迎合我的落后思想，使我在四川为他效劳。
    五一年后宗派的形式改变了，章罗在近年也合作了，现在的方式：一是由集体而变为个别或少数人的接触，交换意见，二是通过会议坚持他们的主张（如今春工作会议的大鸣放，大发展，知识分子问题的看法等等），三是通过章罗二人的密商（如去年他们在北戴河的会商，和今春的四个工作委员会的决定等等），再布置他们的计划。
   章罗联盟的阴谋就是想利用知识分子中的落后部分，作为他们的政治资本与党分庭抗礼，而采用的方法就是有意歪曲传达，或利用他们的地位发出似是而非的消息；他们有时利用合法的组织名义，有时又用私人邀请茶饭谈心方式，或者大谈一套，或者三言两语，总之不外散布毒素，陶醉自己，迷惑别人。这样，凡是与他们接触较密的人们，就受到了他们深刻的影响（当然受影响的人，必然是思想上与他们有共同基础），对某些意见还以为是代表组织的正确指示，就不知不觉的按照他们的阴谋方向进行了工作，我就是参加了他们这样性质的宗派和阴谋的一人，并且我在四川也就响应了章罗的主张，影响了四川的干部和盟员，因而在整风中起了最恶劣的带头点火作用，把四川盟搞得一团糟，我应该引咎负责。
    我在四川又怎样执行章罗的阴谋呢？在“长期共存，互相监督，百花齐放，百家争鸣”十六个字方针提出后，章罗都以为盟今后的地位和作用，将大有变化，比以往的劲头大多了；对四川盟也就特别发生兴趣，以为那里大有潜力可掘，特别是想在文教界中拉拢群众，企图脱离党的领导，好与党分庭抗礼。所以他们提出政治设计院我就在四川提出民主党派成员必须在学校里参加施工设计，打牌不可以专做梦，桌子脚不可以三缺一等等荒谬主张，简直忘记了宪法上的规定，党为全国人民的核心领导；没有党的领导就不可能建设社会主义。这种妄图与党分庭抗礼，平起平坐的言论，不是反党，反社会主义是甚么呢？
    章罗在政治上既有这样的野心，因此，他们的组织路线就是大发展，罗隆基批评四川发展盟员太少，远不如其它各地，我在四川也就认真执行了他的主张，着重自愿参加，打破三个为主的界限，强调发展青年、中间、落后，希望在大鸣放中以敢于向党批评来提高盟的威望，便于吸收成员；所以主张发展手续可以放宽，流水式也好，中小城市也好，都可不必限制。我因受到罗隆基的批评，我对发展得较多的地方组织如重庆就大加赞扬，对发展得少的如成都就表示不满；我还疑惑田一平对发展组织兴趣不大，怪统战部对发展组织支持不力。
    罗隆基去年到成都视察有关知识分子的问题，他同我商量，开了几次座谈会，访问了一些人。其目的也不外在于：一为盟干部打气，说盟有前途，要大发展组织，二在搜集贯彻知识分子政策中的偏差，所以他特别注意有问题的老知识分子，他在成都收到了一些被斗过的人的信件，这就成为他后来提出平反委员会的根据之一；他今春路过成都机场时，又大夸他的意见提得好，称赞储安平谈得不错，史良、李仲公等的意见提得很坏，这明明是说凡是攻击党的就好，拥护党的就坏，也足以说明他蓄意反党、反人民了，其用意的恶毒尚不止此，他在我面前说明这些意见的动机，就是想利用我传达他这种意思到四川盟的干部和其它的人，实现他到处点火的阴谋。
    我在盟的工作作法上自从“长期共存、互相监督”方针提出以后，对组织独立、政治自由感到兴趣；特别强调与统战部协商，但由自己作主。因此，我对盟的工作安排，人事调整，都往往由盟自己作决定，而在事后才告诉统战部一声。我强调接受党的领导是在方针政策上面，重大问题才去请示一下，所以我就采取了与党的关系不是越靠越拢而是距离越来越远了，这也就说明我也坚决执行了章罗脱离党的领导、自搞一套的作法。不止于此，我还对四川党的领导进行诬蔑，企图挑拨党与党，党与群的团结关系，妄想削弱党的威望，抬高盟的地位。这是十足的英美资产阶级政党的恶劣作风。
    在对待知识分子问题上，我完全接受了罗隆基和费孝通的意见，因而我在成都作传达的时候，只是宣传了他们二人的主张而忽略了胡愈之与楚图南的意见。我也夸大“肃反”、“思改”中的偏差，因此，我不但响应了罗隆基的平反委员会，甚至发展了他的范围和内容。在学校党委制的问题上，我不加辨别地接受了章伯钧的错误传达，也跟着说党委制过去给学校带来了一些损失，因而主张专家治校。在鸣放方面我强调知识分子的进步，一切问题基本上是人民内部的矛盾，因而主张毫无标准的鸣放；甚至说鸣放精神不应限于学术，也可适用于政治；互相监督也不应限于组织，个人也可以发挥监督作用等等谬论。以上说明我在公开抗拒党的领导、反对党的政策上面，与章罗并无不同，现在我才认识到这是违反宪法、反党、反人民的极严重的错误。
    最后，我对我的错误思想的根源要深刻地检查一下。我现在才认识到我的反党反社会主义的思想决不是偶然的而是一贯的，决不单是受了章罗思想的影响而是他们的思想引起了我与他们共鸣，这即是说我的思想本质和根源是与他们有共同的基础的，所以他们的主张与我一拍即合。
    我出生于地主家庭，从十四岁起就到清华读书，开始受美帝教育，直到回国的时候已经是二十七岁了，这说明我长期受了美帝资产阶级教育的毒素。在美国求学时代，我的政治倾向也是非常落后的，我经常与当时有国家主义信仰的同学在一起（王造时、彭文应就与我非常接近），一九二七年宁汉分裂的时候，我尚主张在美的留学生不必有左右袒的表示。一九三○年回国即接受褚辅成、沈钧儒二老之聘，在上海法学院教书，就贩卖英美民主政治，改良主义的中间路线等思想。当时在私立大学教书与国立大学相比，待遇是很差的，生活也是较苦的，所以对国民党又加上一层的不满意。抗日救国运动一起，我参加救国会，但是与我接触较多的，还是王造时。抗战中在昆明参加民盟，那时经常来往的是罗隆基。从以上情况来看，我的右倾思想的根是很深的，我的右倾朋友是很多的。解放以来除土改外，我没有很好地参加其它各种运动，虽然我的生活地位比解放前，无论从那方面来说，是好得多了，可是我的思想意识仍然停留在旧有基础上原封不动，资产阶级旧民主主义的一切遗毒，还是根深蒂固地潜伏着，人生观改变得少，思想进步得慢，以致这些毒菌一旦遇着适当机会，就不知不觉地冒了出来危害人民。在整风中，我不是从人民的立场来进行善意的批评，现在我认识到这个错误，使我感到非常惭愧和痛心。
    最近我的儿子、侄女（一个是团员、一个是党员）都分别由东北和武汉来信，一面表示惋惜，一面表示愤慨，都说党和人民对我不薄，生活比过去国民党时代不知道好了多少倍（我自己也知道要不是在一九四九年得解放，不但生活不下去，就是性命也难保），真想不到过去参加民主革命的人而今天竟会如此地反党、反人民、反社会主义。最近我的两个小儿子（都还在成都读小学）听见说我是右派分子他们又弄不清这个名词的含义，到处向人家打听，损伤了他们幼小天真的心灵，我想起他们不禁使我非常悲痛，再一想起党和人民几年来对我不断的培养、教育和对我的重视，而我竟丧心病狂地不顾一切后果，发出了违背宪法，损害社会主义，破坏党群团结等等谬论，这就使我更痛心了，不仅为落后分子作了代言人，而且是为反革命分子撑腰，起了到处点火的作用，还配得上作一个人民代表吗？
    我现在决心立志痛改前非，重新做人。今天的检讨是不够全面和深入的，我一定要继续彻底交代。我现在诚恳地向人民认错伏罪，坚决与章罗联盟一刀两断，永远跟着共产党走社会主义之路。
