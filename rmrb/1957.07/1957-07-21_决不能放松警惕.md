Absolutely Must Not Relax Vigilance

Fujian, after the anti-rebellion movement, has basically eliminated the remaining counter-revolutionary forces, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated. Although it is located on the front line of national defense, and there was a famine last year, social order is very stable. This most eloquently proves that the anti-rebellion struggle was successful and that the mass anti-rebellion line was completely correct. However, anti-rebellion is a long-term struggle, and we must never relax our fighting spirit.

Joint statement by Liu Yongsheng, Lin Yixin, Li Zhizhong, Hou Zhenya, Zheng Yimu, and Xie Xuehong

We fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo, and Procurator-General Zhang Dingcheng, President Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Premier Ulanhu. Now we would like to express some opinions on the issue of anti-rebellion.

Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of Fujian, together with the people of the whole country, have achieved the basic victory of the socialist revolution and the great achievements of socialist construction. The social landscape has undergone fundamental changes, people's lives have greatly improved, the masses' awareness has been unprecedentedly enhanced, social order is very stable, and various construction undertakings are thriving. We will not forget that under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in Fujian before liberation, the people were impoverished, the finances were exhausted, and disasters were severe. At that time, bandits were rampant and secret agents were rampant. In particular, the Chiang Kai-shek Group made thorough "contingency" deployments before its retreat from the mainland. Subversive agents and secret service forces were widely dispersed, vainly attempting to use Fujian as a base for their counter-attack on the mainland, and constantly engaged in various counter-revolutionary sabotage. Fujian's new face today is inseparable from a series of social reforms we have carried out after liberation, and the large-scale, swift and violent mass class struggles. The anti-rebellion struggle is an important aspect of this. Following the large-scale social suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1950, in order to safeguard our great socialist cause, we have launched a mass movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries in batches over the past two or three years since 1955, resolutely implementing the policy of "raising vigilance, eliminating all special agents, preventing deviations, and not wronging a good person." The results of the movement prove that this struggle is absolutely necessary and correct.

The achievements of the anti-rebellion movement are very significant. First, a large number of counter-revolutionaries were cleared out from within our organs and in society, and from these counter-revolutionaries, we seized two machine guns, 818 long and short guns, more than 38,000 rounds of ammunition of various kinds, 383 hand grenades, more than 50,000 other counter-revolutionary documents, and radio stations, etc. In addition, a group of counter-revolutionaries surrendered to the government under the influence of the Party and government's lenient policy. This gave the enemy a fatal blow. From the specific situation of Fujian being located on the front line of national defense and the current struggle against the enemy, this is of particularly great significance. Second, the political and historical problems of a group of staff members were clarified, and fair conclusions were made for them, enabling them to work with peace of mind, further approach the Party and the government, better play their initiative, and strengthen the unity within the people. Third, through the actual struggle of the movement, cadres and the broad masses were trained and educated, greatly improving the political consciousness and political vigilance of cadres and the broad masses, and learning the ability to correctly resolve the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves under new circumstances. In the anti-rebellion movement, the masses reported and exposed more than 60,000 pieces of material on counter-revolutionaries. Cases solved by the masses with the assistance of the government accounted for about 40% of the total number of cases solved. Many special agents sent by the enemy to sneak in, land, or airdrop were discovered on the same day with the assistance of the broad masses, or were cracked within three or two days. Fourth, the organization of the Party and state organs has been further purified and consolidated, smashing the enemy's conspiracy to sabotage us from within. The counter-revolutionaries who were originally hidden within us are now exposed to the supervision of the broad masses, which is conducive to helping them start anew. Political accidents in organs and enterprises have also been greatly reduced as a result, which provides a strong guarantee for our socialist construction.

After the anti-rebellion movement in our province, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have been basically eliminated, and the people's democratic dictatorship has been further consolidated. Although it is located on the front line of national defense, facing enemy-occupied islands such as Jinmen and Taiwan, and there was a famine in 1956, social order is very stable. This most eloquently proves that our anti-rebellion struggle was successful, and proves that the mass anti-rebellion line was completely correct.

Since the anti-rebellion movement is a mass movement, it is a struggle against hidden enemies, and coupled with insufficient experience at the beginning of the movement, some shortcomings and errors have also occurred in the work, mainly: in the movement, a small number of people who should not have been struggled against as counter-revolutionaries were wrongly struggled against due to lax control. A small number of wrong cases occurred in the work of arrest and trial, and some counter-revolutionaries were also missed. According to the results of the review of nine regions and units such as Jinjiang and Longxi, among 999 counter-revolutionary cases, 13 people were found to have been wrongly identified as counter-revolutionaries, accounting for 1.3% of the total number of counter-revolutionary cases. The situation of omissions is even more serious. In the first half of this year, 67,200 cases were reviewed in the province, and 207 counter-revolutionaries and 141 suspected counter-revolutionaries were found to have been missed. In the first, second, and third batches of movements in Longxi Prefecture, 96 counter-revolutionaries were found to have been missed, accounting for 41% of the total number of 234 counter-revolutionaries in the prefecture that had been decided upon. These shortcomings and errors have all been corrected in a timely manner during the movement in the spirit of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, and mistakes must be corrected." Some were corrected during the 1956 inspection of anti-rebellion cases, and some are currently being corrected.

However, these shortcomings and errors account for only a very secondary position compared with the enormous achievements of the entire anti-rebellion movement. Those who believe that the anti-rebellion movement was wrong, deny the enormous achievements of the anti-rebellion movement, and describe the anti-rebellion movement as "all errors and deviations," "a mess," and "terrible," are groundless slanders and are obviously harboring ulterior motives. The people are clear about this, and they have expressed unparalleled indignation at this kind of reactionary rhetoric.

Eliminating counter-revolutionaries is a long-term struggle, and we must never relax our fighting spirit in the slightest. At present, the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have not been completely eliminated, and some counter-revolutionaries have also been missed in the internal and external anti-rebellion movements. For example, in the review work in Longxi Prefecture, 96 counter-revolutionaries have already been found to have been missed. In Haicheng County of the prefecture, there was a Liu Piqia, who was a liaison officer of the Sixth Detachment of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army, who infiltrated the CCP and maintained close contact with secret agents. There are also counter-revolutionaries who are hiding even deeper and have not been discovered. The US-Chiang special service agencies are still constantly sending special agents and spies to the Fujian region. For example, in the case of Hu Chunhe, a hidden agent of the Second Department of the Chiang gang's Ministry of National Defense, which was cracked in Xiamen not long ago, Hu went to Taiwan from Thailand in October 1955, received special agent training from the Second Department of the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense, and went to Hong Kong from Taiwan in March 1956. He infiltrated our province under the name of returned overseas Chinese and successively operated in Zhao'an, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen, repeatedly sending out military and political intelligence. The US-Chiang special service agencies also took advantage of the Polish and Hungarian incidents and certain gaps in our work to carry out their so-called "psychological warfare," conducting anti-communist and anti-people propaganda in the form of reactionary leaflets and letters. A small number of remaining counter-revolutionaries in the country are still constantly engaged in sabotage activities. Wu Yuxuan, a remaining counter-revolutionary in Xuefeng Town, Sanming County, gathered a crowd to eat broadsword talismans on the evening of April 18 this year in an attempt to organize a broadsword society riot. Five landlord elements have been found in Jinjiang Prefecture to be launching counter-attacks against farmers, taking back houses and house foundations that were distributed to farmers during the land reform. The above facts tell us that we must not relax our vigilance against counter-revolutionaries. As long as there are counter-revolutionaries, we must resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate them. Some people say that the class struggle has basically ended now, the world is at peace, and there is no need to engage in anti-rebellion struggles anymore. This kind of argument is groundless and extremely absurd.

Fujian is on the front line of national defense, facing various intrusions by the enemy. We should maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance at all times. Don't think that there are not many counter-revolutionaries and paralyze ourselves, otherwise we will be greatly fooled and suffer great losses. We must recognize that although the number of counter-revolutionaries is small, their counter-revolutionary activities are extremely harmful to the country and the people. Therefore, in the future, we must continue to implement the policy of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, and mistakes must be corrected," continue to carry out anti-rebellion work, further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, and resolutely fight the counter-revolutionaries to the end.

At present, a small handful of bourgeois rightists are carrying out vicious conspiracies against the Communist Party, against the people, and against socialism. They are trying to take advantage of individual shortcomings and errors in the anti-rebellion struggle and other work to launch an attack on the Party and the government. We firmly oppose their criminal activities, and we, the people of Fujian Province and the people of the whole country, will never let their conspiracy succeed. If they can thoroughly confess and start anew, the people can still give them a broad way out. If they persist in their reactionary stance and refuse to come to their senses, they will inevitably isolate themselves from the people and bring about a shameful end.

    决不能放松警惕
    福建经过肃反运动，残余反革命势力基本肃清，人民民主专政更加巩固，虽然地处国防前线，加以去年还有灾荒，但社会秩序却十分安定。这就最雄辩地证明肃反斗争是成功的，群众肃反的路线是完全正确的。但是肃反是一个长期的斗争，我们绝不能松懈斗志。
    刘永生、林一心、李质忠、侯振亚、郑依牳、谢雪红的联合发言
    我们完全同意周恩来总理、李先念、薄一波副总理和张鼎丞检察长、董必武院长、彭真副委员长、乌兰夫副总理的报告。现在我们就肃反问题发表一些意见。
    福建人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，同全国人民一道取得了社会主义革命的基本胜利和社会主义建设的伟大成就。社会面貌发生了根本变化，人民生活有了很大改善，群众觉悟空前提高，社会秩序十分安定，各项建设事业欣欣向荣。我们不会忘记：在解放前国民党反动统治下的福建，是民穷财尽、灾难深重，那时土匪猖獗，特务横行，尤其是蒋介石集团在其退出大陆之前作了周密的“应变”部署，潜伏特务和特务武装散布极广，妄想以福建作为其反攻大陆的基地，不断地进行各种反革命破坏；福建之所以有今天的新面貌，是与我们在解放后进行一系列的社会改革、进行了大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争分不开的，肃反斗争是其中的一个重要方面。继一九五○年社会大镇反之后，为了保卫我们社会主义的伟大事业，从一九五五年以来的两三年中，我们分批地开展了群众性的肃清反革命分子的运动，坚决贯彻了“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子，防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人”的方针，运动结果证明，这个斗争是完全必要的、正确的。
    肃反运动的成绩是十分巨大的。第一、从我们机关内部和社会上清查出一大批反革命分子，并从这些反革命分子中缴获到机枪二挺，长短枪八百一十八枝，各种子弹三万八千余发，手榴弹三百八十三颗，其他反革命证件五万余件及无线电台等物。此外，也有一批反革命分子在党和政府的宽大政策感召下，向政府投案自首。这就给了敌人以致命的打击。从福建处于国防前线和当前对敌斗争的具体情况来说，有其特别重大的意义。第二、查清了一批工作人员的政治、历史问题，给他们做出了公正的结论，使他们安心工作，进一步靠拢党和政府，更好的发挥其积极性，加强了人民内部的团结。第三、通过运动的实际斗争，锻炼和教育了干部与广大群众，大大地提高了干部和广大群众的政治觉悟和政治警惕性，学会了在新的情况下正确解决敌我矛盾的本领。在肃反运动中群众检举揭发反革命分子的材料即达六万余件。由群众协助政府侦破的案件，占破案总数的百分之四十左右，敌人派遣偷渡登陆或空投的特务分子，很多在广大群众协助下当天即被发现，或在三两天内即被破获。第四、进一步纯洁和巩固了党和国家机关的组织，粉碎了敌人企图从内部来破坏我们的阴谋，原隐藏在我内部的反革命分子，现在则暴露在广大群众的监督之下，有利于帮助他们重新做人；机关、企业的政治事故，也因之而大大减少了，这就为我们的社会主义建设事业提供了有力的保证。
    我省经过肃反运动，残余反革命势力已基本肃清，人民民主专政更加巩固，虽然处在国防前线，面临金门、台湾等敌占岛屿，加以一九五六年还有灾荒，但社会秩序却十分安定，这就最雄辩的证明了我们的肃反斗争是成功的，证明了群众肃反的路线是完全正确的。
    由于肃反运动是一个群众性的运动，是与隐蔽的敌人作斗争，加之运动开展之初经验不足，工作中也发生过某些缺点错误，主要是：在运动中控制不严错斗了少数不应当作为反革命分子斗争的人，在逮捕和审判工作中曾发生少数的错案，也漏掉了一些反革命分子，根据晋江、龙溪等九个地区和单位复查的结果，在九百九十九件反革命案件中，查出错定为反革命分子的有十三人，占反革命案件总数的百分之一点三。漏掉的情况则更严重，全省今年上半年复查了六万七千二百个案件中，发现漏掉的反革命分子有二百零七件，反革命嫌疑分子一百四十一件；龙溪专区在一、二、三批运动中，查出漏掉的反革命分子有九十六人，竟占该专区已定案的反革命分子总数二百三十四人的百分之四十一。对这些缺点错误均本着“有反必肃，有错必纠”的精神，有的已经在运动过程中及时发现纠正了；有的在一九五六年检查肃反案件中得到了纠正，有的现在正在纠正中。
    但是，这些缺点、错误和整个肃反运动所获得的巨大成绩比较起来，仅占极其次要的地位，那些认为肃反运动搞错了，否定肃反运动的巨大成绩，把肃反运动说成“尽是错误偏差”、“胡闹”、“糟糕透顶”，这是一种毫无根据的诽谤，显然是别有用心的。人民群众是看得清楚的，他们对于这种反动论调已经表示了无比的愤慨。
    肃清反革命分子是一个长期的斗争，我们绝不能丝毫松懈斗志。目前残余反革命势力尚未完全肃清，而内外肃反运动中也漏掉一些反革命分子。如龙溪专区在复查工作中，已经查出漏掉的反革命分子九十六人。该专区的海澄县，有个刘丕洽，是反共救国军第九纵队第六支队的联络员，混入了中共党内，和特务分子保持密切联络。也还有反革命分子隐藏得更深而未被发现，美蒋特务机关还在不断地向福建地区派遣特务间谍。如不久前在厦门破获的蒋帮国防部二厅潜伏特务胡春和案件，胡于一九五五年十月由泰国到台湾，受过伪国防部二厅的特务训练，一九五六年三月由台湾到香港，用归国华侨的名义潜入我省，先后活动于诏安、漳州和厦门等地，先后多次送出军事、政治情报。美蒋特务机关并利用波匈事件及我们工作中的某些空隙，施行其所谓“心理作战”，以反动传单、信件等形式，进行反共反人民的宣传。国内少数残余反革命分子仍不断地进行破坏活动，三明县雪峰镇残余反革命分子伍裕轩，于今年四月十八日晚，纠众吃大刀符，企图组织刀会暴乱；晋江专区已发现有五个地主分子向农民反攻，将土改时分给农民的房屋及房屋地基等抽回。上述这些事实告诉我们，决不能放松对反革命分子的警惕，只要有反革命分子存在，我们就必须坚决、彻底、干净地肃清它。有人说：现在阶级斗争基本结束了，天下太平了，用不着再搞肃反斗争了，这种论调是毫无根据的，是极端荒谬的。
    福建是国防前线，面对敌人的各种侵扰，我们应随时保持高度的革命警惕性，不要以为反革命分子不多了，而把自己麻痹起来，那就会上大当、吃大亏的。必须认识：反革命分子虽然为数不多，但他们的反革命活动对国家和人民的危害是极大的。因此，今后必须继续贯彻“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针，继续进行肃反工作，进一步巩固人民民主专政，坚决和反革命分子斗争到底。
    目前一小撮资产阶级右派分子，进行恶毒的反共、反人民、反社会主义的阴谋活动，他们企图利用肃反斗争和其他工作中的个别缺点、错误，发动对党和政府的进攻，我们坚决反对他们这种罪恶活动，我们福建全省人民和全国人民一道决不让其阴谋得逞。他们倘能彻底交代，从新作人，人民还可以给其宽大的出路，如果坚持反动立场，执迷不悟，那就必将自绝于人民，招致可耻的结局。
