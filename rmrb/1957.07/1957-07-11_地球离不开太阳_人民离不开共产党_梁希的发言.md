I am unable to attend the Fourth Session of the National People's Congress due to illness. These past few days, I have been reading Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the state budget and final accounts, and Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report on the national economic plan in the newspapers, and I have been greatly encouraged and extremely excited. Therefore, I am making a simple written statement outside the meeting.

Chairman Mao said in his opening address at the First Session of the First National People's Congress, "The core force leading our cause is the Chinese Communist Party."

The Chinese people, revolving around this radiant core, like the moon orbiting the earth and the earth orbiting the sun, follow a certain orbit, exert a high degree of centripetal force, and operate smoothly, continuously, and naturally. Not only was the revolution victorious, but also socialist construction has been successful in every stage.

History tells us that all objects, from atoms to the solar system, must have a core; all countries, regardless of size or population, must also have a political leadership core. China is no exception. Not to mention the distant past, but in the hundred years before liberation, the Qing Dynasty royal family served as the leadership core of the Chinese people, and politics were in a terrible state; the Northern Warlords served as the leadership core of the Chinese people, and politics were still terrible; the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique then served as the leadership core of the Chinese people, and politics were even worse. Older intellectuals still remember an old saying, "Chinese politics are not on track." This is not difficult to understand. If the earth leaves the sun and wanders around in the air, of course it will not be on track; similarly, if the people do not have a good leadership core and engage in politics randomly, then politics will certainly not be on track.

The Sun's Heat Makes the Giant Wheels of Industry Spin Rapidly

The Chinese Communist Party is precisely the leadership core of the 600 million people, and also precisely the sun of the 600 million people.

From this sun, heat will be emitted, burning the stoves of various factories, driving the wheels of various workshops, and stimulating the labor enthusiasm of millions upon millions of workers. This enabled our country to produce 16.3 million tons of steel during the first Five-Year Plan, nearly double the total steel production in old China from 1900 to 1948, a period of 49 years. This enables our country to produce 117 million tons of raw coal in 1957, nearly double the highest annual output in old China from 1890 to 1949, a period of 60 years. This enabled our country to manufacture new products in 1956 that old China could not manufacture, such as jet aircraft, heavy-duty trucks, large-scale hydroelectric power equipment, large-scale thermal power equipment, and single-spindle automatic lathes. In addition, light industry, transportation, railways, etc., have all experienced leap-forward development. Taking railways as an example, the Kuomintang built only 2,600 kilometers during its 22 years of rule, while we built 8,500 kilometers of new railways during the first Five-Year Plan.

In short, the pace of China's industrial development is very fast. According to Vice Premier Li's report, the income of industrial enterprises in 1956 increased by 25.58 percent compared with the previous year. This figure has attracted the attention of the United Nations. A United Nations report on the evening of June 30 stated that among all countries in the world, the countries where industrial production increased the fastest in 1956 compared with 1955 were Japan and China. Japan increased by 21.3 percent compared with the previous year, and China increased by 25 percent. That is to say, China's industrial growth rate ranked first in the world in 1956. Who says our achievements are not major?

Sunlight Makes Agricultural Harvests Grow Continuously

The Chinese Communist Party, this sun, will also emit light, illuminating the 1.67 billion mu of cultivated land across the country and inspiring the production enthusiasm of 500 million farmers. Although our country encountered the largest drought in decades in 1956, with 200 million mu of land and 70 million people under the threat of natural disasters and severely tested, everyone can know from the test results that Premier Zhou loudly announced to more than a thousand people's representatives at Huairentang on June 26 that Chinese farmers can withstand the test! This year, the total agricultural output value reached 58.3 billion yuan, an increase of 2.74 billion yuan compared with 1955. Grain production (excluding soybeans) reached 365 billion jin, an increase of 15.4 billion jin compared with 1955. Soybean production, according to Vice Premier Bo's report, reached 20.47 billion jin, an increase of 2.2 billion jin compared with 1955.

Older people still remember that before liberation, China was known as an agricultural country, but many people relied on Saigon rice to survive. If there was a drought, there would be refugees everywhere, starving people lying on the roads, in a state of utter misery. It can be seen from this that Chinese agriculture has made rapid progress in the past seven years.

The miraculous speed of China's agricultural development has attracted the attention of Professor Matsuura of Hokkaido University in Japan. Professor Matsuura led a delegation to China for more than a month. When they passed through Hong Kong on their way back to their country, they gave a speech on July 2, saying that China's agricultural development level will catch up with or even exceed Japan's level in two or three years. Who says our achievements are not major?

In short, our country's industry and agriculture have made great progress. It is particularly worth pointing out that the country's industrialization has made significant achievements: in 1956, the total industrial output value of our country was 58.66 billion yuan, and the total agricultural output value was 58.29 billion yuan, that is, the total industrial output value accounted for 50.1 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Looking back at 1949, the total industrial output value of the country only accounted for 31 percent of the total industrial and agricultural output value, which shows that our country has taken a big step from an agricultural country to industrialization.

Moreover, according to the report, among the total industrial output value of 58.66 billion yuan in 1956, the output value of means of production accounted for 49.7 percent. Looking back at 1952, the output value of means of production accounted for 39.7 percent of the total industrial output value, which is also the recent progress in China's industry.

Numbers are the most realistic and rigid. After reading the report, everyone will immediately see the leap-forward development of the new China in the past seven years from the numbers. Can right-wingers draw a negative conclusion from the same numbers? Since it is impossible to draw two different conclusions, then everyone should express satisfaction with the political achievements after liberation, and thus express satisfaction with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

"Painless Childbirth" - A Great Revolution Without Chaos

It must be pointed out that the industry and agriculture that have recently developed are basically socialist, not capitalist undertakings. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report that in 1956, 120 million peasant households, more than 5 million handicraftsmen, 70,000 private industrial enterprises, and 2 million private large, medium, and small stores were permanently separated from private ownership. This was a world-shaking, unprecedented socialist revolution.

Such a great reform that permanently eliminates exploitation and eliminates classes should, in principle, be a greater change and therefore a more violent shock than the 17th-century English bourgeois revolution and the 18th-century French revolution; however, the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao commanded calmly, and in the process of great change, as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "Social property was not damaged, social order was not disrupted, and social production did not decline. On the contrary, in the first year that we achieved basic victory in this great revolution, we achieved great achievements in all aspects." It can be said that the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao are like a socialist, magical obstetrician, using a new painless childbirth method to give birth to a clean and lovely baby. Even gentlemen who are good at nitpicking, I am afraid, cannot reverse right and wrong and make random criticisms of this "great achievement."

The General Trend is Set, Right-Wingers, Stop!

Of course, the Chinese Communist Party welcomes criticism, but if the criticism exceeds a certain range, goes to the point of alarmism, or even goes to the point of spreading rumors to confuse the public, what benefit is there to the CCP's rectification? What benefit is there to the people?

The facts are clearly before us: never in Chinese history has there been a period like the present when all ethnic groups live in peace and form a harmonious family, creating a great unity of the country. Apart from socialist countries, few countries in the world can spend 56 percent or 63 percent of the national budget on economic and cultural undertakings, seeking welfare for the people, and reducing defense expenditures year by year. The facts also clearly tell us that in the past seven years, our country has solved the employment problem for 13 million people, including 2.3 million people in 1956 alone. In terms of people's lives, the purchasing power in rural areas increased by 136 percent in 1956 compared with 1950; in cities, due to the increase in the average wage of all employees across the country, the social purchasing power in 1956 increased by 15.6 percent compared with the previous year.

In such a peaceful, happy, and joyful environment, in such an independent, democratic, unified, and powerful country, there are still a few intellectuals who complain every day, say strange things, and fear that the world will not be in chaos. May I ask, if the world is really in chaos, what good will it do them?

There are also a few intellectuals who are greedy and want to compete with the Chinese Communist Party for leadership. I don't know what those people are "here for"? It should be known that the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people in arduous struggles for more than 20 years before seizing power from imperialism, feudalism, and comprador capitalism. This regime is so precious that the Chinese Communist Party certainly still needs to lead all democratic parties, all ethnic groups, and all people's organizations to defend it; at the same time, the Chinese people also unanimously hope that the Chinese Communist Party will lead the people of the whole country to defend the regime and defend the fruits of the revolution, and will not allow any group to usurp it. Furthermore, from the perspective of the laws of historical development, socialism must not retreat to capitalism, and the dictatorship of the proletariat must not retreat to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, although some people may still have some wishful thinking, in the new era, the trend of vying for power and profit has become a thing of the past, and usurpation is even more out of the question. How can a mayfly shake a big tree? Gentlemen, stop!

### 地球离不开太阳  人民离不开共产党  梁希的发言

专栏：

    地球离不开太阳  人民离不开共产党
    梁希的发言
    我因病不能出席全国人民代表大会第四次会议。这几天，从报上读到周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李先念副总理的国家预决算报告和薄一波副总理的国家经济计划报告，心中得到了极大的鼓舞和极大的兴奋，因此，在会外作简单的书面发言。
    毛主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕词中说过，“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党”。
    中国人民，围绕这个光芒万丈的核心，像月绕地球和地球绕日一样，遵循着一定的轨道，发挥着高度的向心力，顺利地、无间断地、自然而然地运转，不独革命胜利了，即社会主义建设亦节节成功。
    历史告诉我们，一切物体，不论小到原子，大到太阳系，必有一个核心；一切国家，不论面积大小，人口多少，也必有一个政治上的领导核心。中国不能例外，远的不说，只说解放前一百多年间，清朝皇室做过中国人民的领导核心，政治搞得很糟；北洋军阀做过中国人民的领导核心，政治还是很糟；蒋介石反动派又做过中国人民的领导核心，政治搞得更糟。年龄较大一些的知识分子，都还记得一句旧话，叫做“中国政治不上轨道”。这是不难理解的，地球如果离开太阳，在空中乱走，当然走不上轨；同样，人民如果没有一个好的领导核心，乱搞政治，政治也当然要不上轨道了。
    太阳热使工业的巨轮飞速旋转
    中国共产党正是六万万人的领导核心，也正是六万万人的太阳。
    从这个太阳里会发出热来，燃烧着各个工厂的炉灶，鼓动着各个车间的轮子，激发着上百万上千万工人群众的劳动热忱。使我国在第一个五年计划期间能产钢一千六百三十万吨，抵旧中国从一九○○到一九四八年四十九年间产钢总量的将近二倍。使我国在一九五七年将产原煤一亿一千七百万吨，抵旧中国一八九○年至一九四九年六十年间最高年产量的将近两倍。使我国在一九五六年能制造旧中国所不能制造的喷气式飞机、载重汽车、大型水力发电设备、大型火力发电设备和单轴自动车床等新产品。此外，轻工业、交通、铁道等等，都有跃进的发展，就铁道论，国民党统治二十二年间仅修建了二千六百公里，而我们第一个五年计划期间新建铁路八千五百公里。
    总之，中国工业发展的进度是很快的，根据李副总理报告，一九五六年工业企业收入，比上年增加百分之二十五点五八。这个数字，引起了联合国的注意。联合国六月三十晚报道，在世界各国中，一九五六年的工业生产，比一九五五年的工业生产增加得最快的是日本与中国。日本比上年增加百分之二十一点三，中国增加百分之二十五。就是说，一九五六年我国工业增长速度占世界第一。谁说我们的成绩不是主要的？
    太阳光使农业的收成不断增长
    中国共产党这个太阳还会发出光来，照耀着全国十六亿七千万亩耕地，鼓舞着五万万农民的生产积极性。尽管一九五六年我国碰到了几十年来最大的一次灾荒，有二亿亩土地、七千万人口处在天灾的威胁下，受到了严重的考验，但是，根据六月二十六日周总理在怀仁堂向一千多位人民代表响亮地宣布了的考试成绩，大家就可以知道，中国农民是经得起考验的！这一年，农业总产值达到五百八十三亿元，比一九五五年增加了二十七亿四千万元。粮食产量（不包括大豆）达到三千六百五十亿斤，比一九五五年增加了一百五十四亿斤。大豆产量，根据薄副总理报告，达到二百零四亿七千万斤，比一九五五年增加了二十二亿斤。
    年龄较大一些的人都还记得，解放前，中国号称以农立国，而许多人却靠西贡米养活。如果逢到一次灾荒，那更是流民满野，饿殍载道，狼狈万分。由此可见，七年来中国农业有飞跃的发展。
    中国农业发展的奇速，引起了日本北海道大学松蒲一教授的注意。松蒲一教授率领了一个访问团来华访问一个多月，归国时路过香港，在七月二日发表谈话，说中国农业发展水平，将在两三年内赶上或者甚至超过日本水平。谁说我们的成绩不是主要的？
    总之，我国工农业都有长足的进步。特别值得指出的，国家工业化方面有显著的成绩：一九五六年我国工业总产值五百八十六亿六千万元，农业总产值五百八十二亿九千万元，即工业总产值占工农业总产值的百分之五十点一。回看一九四九年，全国工业总产值仅占工农业总产值的百分之三十一，足见现在我国由农业国向工业化迈进了一大步。
    而且根据报告，一九五六年工业总产值五百八十六亿六千万元中，生产资料产值占百分之四十九点七。回看一九五二年，则生产资料产值占工业总产值的百分之三十九点七，这也是最近中国工业上的进步。
    数字是最现实的，也是最硬性的。大家读了报告，马上会从数字上看出新中国七年来的飞跃发展，难道右派分子会从同样的数字中，得出一个反面的结论来吗？既然不能得出两样结论，那末，大家都应该对解放后的政治成绩表示满意，从而对中国共产党的领导表示满意。
    “无痛分娩法”——大革命而没有混乱
    必须指出，最近发展起来的工农业，基本上已经是属于社会主义，而不是属于资本主义事业。周总理报告中指出，一九五六年，一亿二千万户农民、五百多万手工业者、七万户私营工业企业、二百万户私营大中小商店，永远脱离了私有制。这是一次翻天覆地、史无前例的社会主义大革命。
    这样一次永远消灭剥削、消灭阶级的大改革，照理说，比十七世纪英国资产阶级革命和十八世纪法国革命，变化更大，从而震动也应该更剧烈；然而，中国共产党和毛主席指挥若定，在大变革的过程中，如周总理报告中所指出：“社会财产没有遭到损坏，社会秩序没有发生混乱，社会生产没有下降。恰恰相反，我们在这个大革命取得基本胜利的第一年，就在各方面取得了巨大的成绩”。可以说，中国共产党和毛主席，好像是一个社会主义的神妙的产科医生，用新式的无痛分娩法，催生出一个洁白可爱的婴儿。这种“巨大的成绩”，即使是善于吹毛求疵的先生们，恐怕也不能把是非颠倒过来，乱下批评吧。
    大势已定，右派先生休矣！
    当然，中国共产党是欢迎批评的，但，如果批评超出了一定范围，走到危言耸听的一边，甚至走到谣言惑众的一边，对中共整风有什么益处？对人民有什么益处。
    事实明明白白地摆在我们面前：中国历史上从来没有一个时期，像现在一样的各民族相安无事，形成和睦的大家庭，造成河山的大统一。世界各国除了社会主义国家以外，很少有国家能把百分之五十六或百分之六十三的国家预算费花在经济文化事业上，为人民谋福利，而把国防费用逐年削减。事实又明明白白地告诉我们：七年来，我国解决了一千三百万人的就业问题，其中一九五六年一年，就有二百三十万人就业。人民生活方面，在农村则一九五六年购买力比一九五○年提高了百分之一百三十六；在城市，则由于全国职工每人平均工资提高，一九五六年的社会购买力比上年增加百分之十五点六。
    在这样一个和平、幸福、快乐的环境里，在这样一个独立、民主、统一、强大的国家里，却有少数知识分子天天发牢骚，说怪话，惟恐天下不乱。试问，天下如果真的乱了，于他们有什么好处？
    还有少数知识分子得陇望蜀，贪心不足，要和中国共产党争领导权，不知那些人“所为何来”？应该知道，中国共产党领导中国人民，艰苦卓绝地斗争了二十多年，才从帝国主义、封建主义、买办资本主义手里夺取了政权。这个政权何等可贵，中国共产党当然还有必要领导各民主党派、各民族、各人民团体去保卫它；同时，中国人民也一致希望中国共产党领导全国人民保卫政权，保卫革命的胜利果实，而不许任何集团篡夺。另从历史发展的规律来看，社会主义决不能退回到资本主义，无产阶级专政决不能退回到资产阶级专政。所以，某些人虽然可能还有些妄想，但在新时代，争权夺利之风已成过去，篡位更不待言。蜉蝣何能撼大树？先生休矣！
