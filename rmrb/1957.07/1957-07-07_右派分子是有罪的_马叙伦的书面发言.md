Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report comprehensively summarized the great achievements and rich experiences of the Chinese people in socialist revolution and socialist construction in 1956, and pointed out the direction for our progress; at the same time, it powerfully criticized the absurd remarks and sinful actions of the bourgeois rightists against socialism, and defended the interests of our entire people. This report reflects the will and strength of the 600 million people of the country, and will further strengthen and encourage our confidence and enthusiasm in moving towards socialism. Therefore, I fully agree with and support this report.

In recent years, the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in completing the socialist revolution, carrying out socialist construction, and improving people's lives in all aspects are unprecedented. The victory of the five major movements ensured the smooth progress of the three major transformations, and the basic completion of the three major transformations has laid a solid foundation for building socialism. The facts of the past few years have vividly proved the unparalleled superiority of socialism, making more and more people support and love socialism. Take 1956 as an example, the total industrial output value has completed the target of the last year of the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. Even the United Nations admits that China's industrial growth rate last year was the highest in the world. Now the Chinese people are able to manufacture jet aircraft, locomotives, heavy-duty trucks, and various large-scale machines themselves, which was unimaginable in old China. In agriculture, although we suffered huge natural disasters last year, the collectivized farmers who embarked on cooperation finally withstood the severe test and overcame various difficulties, so that the total grain output still exceeded the Five-Year Plan, and the income of the vast number of farmers increased. In my previous inspections in rural areas, I also saw with my own eyes that the lives of farmers today have been greatly improved. Now farmers not only have food to eat and clothes to wear, but also can eat their fill and dress warmly, which cannot be compared with the life of "half a year of grain with bran and vegetables" in old China. Looking at cultural and educational undertakings, there has also been great development in 1956. The number of middle school students in the country has reached more than 5.15 million, an increase of nearly five times compared with the early days of liberation. In 1956 alone, the expenditure on general education and teacher training accounted for 4.96 percent of the total national budget, which shows the state's emphasis on education. In short, the achievements of the past eight years are too numerous to mention. What I have mentioned is just a small part, but it is enough to show that the achievements of the Chinese people are iron facts placed before people. Anyone who is not blind can see them.

These achievements are the result of the hard work of the 600 million people of our country, and the fundamental reason lies in the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China. It is precisely because of the correct leadership of the Party that the Chinese people have won continuous victories in the democratic revolution and socialism; it is precisely because of this that our country has moved from a tragic situation of devastation, poverty, and suffering to a prosperous, independent, and strong road. After suffering for a hundred years, the Chinese people have drawn a conclusion from history, that is, China must take the road of socialism and must be led by the Communist Party. The practice of the past eight years has vividly educated the people of the whole country, understanding that only by taking the socialist road is the only road, and only the leadership of the Communist Party can bring happiness to the 600 million people and make their children and grandchildren live a happy and beautiful life forever. Without the Communist Party, without socialism, there would be no new China.

The achievements of the eight years since the founding of the country are fundamental, and the Communist Party is great, and no one is allowed to obliterate and slander them. Of course, we do not deny that the Party has some shortcomings and mistakes in leading socialist construction. Because in such a big country as China, the construction of socialism lacks experience, so shortcomings and mistakes in work are unavoidable. What is admirable is that the great Communist Party of China never shies away from its faults or covers up its shortcomings. This rectification movement is precisely to overcome the shortcomings and mistakes in the work, eliminate bureaucracy, subjectivism, and sectarianism, so as to better build socialism. In the rectification, the Communist Party is "modest and open-minded," listening to opinions from all sides, and striving to correct shortcomings and improve its work, which is also obvious to all.

But what is infuriating is that in the democratic parties, there is a small group of rightist ambitious elements, such as Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Zhang Naiqi, Huang Shaohong, and Chu Anping, who dare to seize the opportunity to carry out ulterior motives and sinful activities. They vainly attempt to obliterate the achievements in past work, exaggerate the deviations in work, in order to shake the fruits of the revolution and obliterate the achievements of the Communist Party. They also issued the so-called fallacy of "the Party's world," slandering the people's democratic dictatorship as the "root of the three evils," and attacking the basic system of the country. Although the reactionary words and deeds of the rightists are of various forms, their essence is to attempt to negate the leadership of the Party, abolish the people's democratic dictatorship, and oppose taking the socialist road. The rightist ambitious elements vainly attempt to usurp the leadership of the country, so as to "restore" capitalism in China, pull the wheels of history backward, and place the people in a state of eternal doom. This kind of conspiracy and trickery is absolutely intolerable to the broad masses of the people, and this sinful act of launching a frenzied attack on the people of the whole country must be resolutely fought back.

The recent period of the anti-rightist struggle shows that the Communist Party has not been weakened by the attack of the rightists, but it is the rightists themselves who have been battered and bruised in front of the 600 million people. I want to warn the rightists: your conspiracy has gone bankrupt, your illusions have fallen through, you have already made serious mistakes, and you are guilty. But today the people can still be lenient to you and not punish you. Therefore, I hope that you will bow your heads to admit your guilt, repent sincerely, and accept transformation. If you continue to resist to the end, adhere to your reactionary stance, and even take destructive actions, then you will cut yourself off from the people. Where to go and where to go depends on yourselves.

Premier Zhou's report pointed out: "The Communist Party is the leading force and the core force of the united front, and socialism is the political basis of the united front, which is also the common goal of the unity and struggle of the people of the whole country. These unshakable principles are the track that the democratic parties participating in the people's democratic united front must follow. Leaving this track means being outside the united front." I fully support these principles. Our democratic parties must learn from this anti-rightist struggle, exercise themselves in the current rectification movement, step up self-transformation, distinguish right from wrong, firmly establish a socialist stance, and sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party. Only in this way can we coexist with the Communist Party for a long time, can we play a positive role in the national life, and can we gain the trust of the 600 million people.

    右派分子是有罪的
    马叙伦的书面发言
    周恩来总理的政府工作报告，全面地总结了一九五六年我国人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的伟大成就和丰富经验，指出了我们前进的方向；同时有力地批判了资产阶级右派分子反社会主义的荒谬言论和罪恶行动，捍卫了我们全民的利益。这个报告反映了全国六亿人民的意志和力量，将更加坚定和鼓舞我们走向社会主义的信心和热情。因此，我完全同意和拥护这个报告。
    这几年来，我国人民在完成社会主义革命，进行社会主义建设及提高人民生活等各方面的辉煌成就是史无前例的。五大运动的胜利，保证了三大改造的顺利进行，而三大改造的基本完成已给建设社会主义奠定了巩固的基础。几年来的事实已经生动地证明了社会主义的无比优越性，使越来越多的人拥护和热爱社会主义了。就拿一九五六年来说，工业总产值已提前一年并超额完成了五年计划最后一年的指标。连联合国也承认去年我国工业增长速度是举世第一。现在我国人民已经能够自己制造喷气式飞机、火车头、载重汽车和各种大型机器，这在旧中国是做梦也想不到的。在农业方面，虽然去年遭受了巨大的自然灾害，但是走上合作化的集体农民，终于经得起严重的考验，战胜了种种困难，使粮食的总产量还超额完成了五年计划，广大农民的收入有所增加。我以前在农村视察中，也亲眼看到今天的农民生活已大大改善了，现在农民不仅有饭吃，有衣穿，而且还能吃得饱，穿得暖，这与旧中国“糠菜半年粮”的生活相比是不可以道里计了。再从文化教育事业来看，一九五六年也有很大的发展。全国的中学生已达到五百一十五万余人，较解放初期增加了将近五倍，一九五六年仅普通教育和师范教育的经费就占国家总预算的百分之四点九六，可见国家对教育事业的重视。总之，八年来的成绩是不胜枚举的，我举出的不过一鳞半爪，但足以说明我国人民的成绩是摆在人们面前的铁的事实，只要不是瞎子，是谁也能看得到的。
    这些成绩是我国六亿人民辛勤劳动的结果，而其根本原因则在于中国共产党的正确领导。正是由于党的正确领导，才使我国人民获得了民主革命和社会主义的不断胜利；才使我国从满目疮痍、贫穷困苦的悲惨境地，走向了欣欣向荣、独立富强的康庄大道。中国人民在百年来饱经忧患之后，已从历史中得出结论，这就是中国必须走社会主义的道路，必须由共产党来领导。这八年来的实践，更是活生生地教育了全国人民，懂得了只有走社会主义道路才是唯一的道路，也只有共产党的领导，才能给六亿人民带来幸福，使子子孙孙永远过快乐美好的日子。没有共产党，没有社会主义，也就没有新中国。
    建国八年来的成绩是基本的，共产党是伟大的，决不容许任何人来抹煞和污蔑。当然，我们也不否认党在领导社会主义事业中有些缺点和错误。因为在中国这样的一个大国，建设社会主义是缺乏经验的，因而工作中的缺点和错误也是难免的。令人崇敬的是，伟大的中国共产党从不讳疾忌医，掩盖缺点。这次整风运动正是为了克服工作中的缺点和错误，消除官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，以便更好地建设社会主义。在整风中，共产党“虚怀若谷”，听取各方面的意见，努力纠正缺点和改进工作，这也是有目共睹的。
    但令人愤慨的是，在民主党派中竟有一小撮右派野心分子，像章伯钧、罗隆基、章乃器、黄绍竑、储安平之流，胆敢伺机而动，进行不可告人的罪恶活动。他们妄想抹煞过去工作中的成绩，夸大工作中的偏差，以便动摇革命的成果，抹煞共产党的功绩。他们还发出所谓“党天下”的谬论，污蔑人民民主专政是“三害之根”，而向国家的基本制度进攻。右派分子的反动言行虽然形形色色，但实质都是企图否定党的领导，取消人民民主专政，反对走社会主义道路。右派野心分子妄想篡夺国家的领导权，从而使资本主义在中国“复辟”，把历史车轮拉向后退，置人民于万劫不复之地。这种阴谋诡计是广大人民绝对不能容忍的，这种向全国人民猖狂进攻的罪恶行为是必须加以坚决回击的。
    近一时期的反右派斗争表明，共产党并没有因为右派分子的进攻而削弱，而在六亿人民面前撞得头破血流的正是右派分子自己。我要警告右派分子：你们的阴谋已经破产了，你们的幻想已经落空了，你们已经是犯了严重的错误，你们是有罪的。但是今天人民对你们还可以宽大为怀，不予办罪。因此希望你们低头认罪，憣然悔悟，接受改造，如果你们继续抗拒到底，坚持反动立场，甚至采取破坏活动，那就将自绝于人民，何去何从，决定于你们自己。
    周总理的报告中指出：“共产党是统一战线的领导力量和核心力量，社会主义是统一战线的政治基础，也就是全国人民团结奋斗的共同目标。这些不可动摇的原则，是参加人民民主统一战线的各民主党派所必须遵循的轨道，离开这个轨道，就是自外于统一战线。”我完全拥护这些原则。我们民主党派一定要从这次反右派斗争中吸取教训，在当前的整风运动中，锻炼自己，加紧自我改造，明辨是非，坚定社会主义立场，诚心诚意地接受共产党领导。只有这样，我们才能同共产党长期共存，才能发挥在国家生活中的积极作用，才能取得六亿人民的信任。
