See the Documentary "Struggle Against the Rightists" Tonight

    The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio's short documentary "Struggle Against the Rightists" has been completed. The film truthfully reports on the situation of the masses across the country resolutely fighting back against the Rightists. The film will be shown tonight at the Hongxing and Honglou cinemas in Beijing and the Xinwen Cinema in Tianjin, and is expected to meet audiences nationwide in three days.

    In the debates between workers, students, and Rightists, and at the rectification meetings of various democratic parties, Rightists such as Zhang Bojun, Ge Peiqi, Lin Xiling, Tan Tianrong... were exposed in their true colors under the questioning of angry workers and students with truth and ironclad facts.

    The film uses historical materials recorded before liberation to make a clear and strong comparison between the dark, reactionary, poor, and starving situation of old China and the great achievements of the eight years since liberation. It powerfully and indisputably illustrates that our achievements since the founding of the country are the main aspect! (Xin Xuan) Is performing in the old style really good?

    On the evenings of July 3rd and 4th, the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe held two observation performances at the Zhonghe Theater, completely adopting the Peking Opera performance style of twenty years ago. On the stage, conservative signs of "Generals out" and "Ministers in" were hung. Before the main performance, there were: stage setup, three drumbeats, stage removal, and folk-style dances of jumping the official and jumping the god of wealth. At the end, a Number One Scholar wearing a gauze hat and a red official robe, and a woman dressed as a noble lady played by an old woman, appeared for the grand finale. Many audience members had not seen this form before. The performance also restored the picking up of props and throwing cushions. These two performances evoked different reactions from the audience. The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe is widely soliciting opinions from all sides and preparing to re-evaluate this performance style. (Yun)

    Who Explores the Secrets of the Long Night?

    We don't often come across films with themes like the Soviet film "Secrets of the Long Night." Its story with science fiction elements has a rather strong appeal to us: Oceanographer Zelenov is exposed to a certain radiation and his life is in danger; but he still persists with the greatest perseverance, driving a submarine deep into the seabed to find a new substance called "Atlantis." This new substance not only saves his life but is also a major discovery for the scientific community. The plot develops concisely and to the point, tightly gripping the audience's heartstrings, prompting the audience to eagerly care about Zelenov's fate. The actor playing Zelenov is the famous actor Belyayev. (Fang)

    National Dance Drama Premieres on Stage

    Audience members in the capital who love dance will certainly not forget the internship performances held by the Beijing Dance School last summer. It aroused great interest in everyone.

    Tonight, they are holding their annual internship public performance again. Under the guidance of Soviet experts and Chinese dancer Dai Ailian, this performance features a relatively large-scale multi-act national dance drama and ballet. "Zhang Yu and Qiong Lian" is adapted from the mythical story "Zhang Yu Boils the Sea" based on classical dance. "On the Miao Mountains" is a new creation depicting the real life of the Miao people heroically participating in the struggle to suppress bandits and special agents. The ballet "La Fille Mal Gardée" is a famous 18th-century French comedy. For dance lovers, this is another rare opportunity. (Lan) (Attached picture)

### 今晚去看纪录片“向右派斗争”

    今晚去看纪录片“向右派斗争”
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂拍摄的短纪录片“向右派斗争”已经制作完成。影片如实地报道了全国各地的群众向右派分子坚决回击的情况。影片今晚在北京市红星、红楼两家影院和天津市新闻影院同时上映，预计三天后就可以与全国观众见面了。
    在工人们、学生们和右派分子进行的辩论会上，在各民主党派的整风会议上，右派分子章伯钧、葛佩琦、林希翎、谭天荣……等人在愤怒的工人们和学生们用真理和铁的事实的质问下原形毕露。
    影片用解放前历史资料所纪录的事实，把旧中国的黑暗、反动、贫困、饥饿的悲惨情况与解放后八年来的丰功伟绩作了鲜明强烈的对比。有力地无可置辩地说明了建国以来我们的成绩是主要的！（新宣）按旧形式演，到底好不好？
    7月3、4日晚上，北京市京剧一团在中和戏院举行了两场完全采用二十年前京剧演出形式的观摩公演。舞台上挂着“出将”、“入相”的守旧，正戏开始前，有：摆台、三通、撤台和富有民间色彩的跳加官、跳财神舞蹈。结束时由一头戴纱帽，身穿红官衣的状元和老旦扮的诰命夫人金榜谢幕。这种形式有很多观众尚未见到过。演出中还恢复了拣场、扔垫子等。这两次演出，引起观众不同的反应。北京市京剧一团正在向各方面广泛征求意见，准备对这种演出形式重作估价。（匀）
    谁探索长夜的秘密？
    像苏联影片“长夜的秘密”这类题材的影片，我们是接触得不多的。它的带有科学幻想性质的故事对于我们有着相当强烈的吸引力量：海洋学者节尼索夫受到某种放射线的照射，生命危在旦夕；但是他仍然以最大的毅力坚持着，驾着潜水艇深入海底，找到了一种新物质“阿特兰奇”。这种新物质不但拯救了他的生命，也是科学界的一项重大发现。剧情发展不蔓不枝，简明扼要，紧紧抓住了观众的心弦，促使观众热切关怀着节尼索夫的命运。扮演节尼索夫的是有名的演员别列维尔节夫。　（方）
      民族舞剧初上舞台
    爱好舞蹈的首都观众，一定不会忘记去年暑假北京舞蹈学校举行过的实习演出。它曾引起大家极大的兴趣。
    今天晚上，他们又举行一年一度的实习公演了。在苏联专家和我国舞蹈家戴爱莲的指导下，这一次演出的节目是具有相当规模的多幕民族舞剧和芭蕾舞剧。“张羽与琼莲”是根据神话故事“张羽煮海”，以古典舞蹈为基础改编的。“苗岭山上”则是描写苗族人民英勇参加肃清匪特斗争的现实生活为题材的新创作。芭蕾舞剧“无益谨慎”却是一出著名的十八世纪的法国喜剧。对于爱好舞蹈的观众来说，这又是一次难得的好机会。（兰）（附图片）
