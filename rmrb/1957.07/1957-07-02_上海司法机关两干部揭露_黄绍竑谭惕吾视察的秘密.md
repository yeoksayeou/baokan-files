Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. Two judicial workers published articles in the Shanghai "Liberation Daily" yesterday, exposing the secrets of Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu's inspection of Shanghai's judicial work. According to their revelations, Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu, during their inspection, were always unwilling to look at achievements but instead nitpicked to find shortcomings, then exaggerated the shortcomings, and made some remarks that violated socialist legality.

The article by judicial workers Wu Hongze and Zhuo Qimin stated: The shortcomings in our work originally existed in both aspects, namely, wrongly releasing and leniently sentencing, and wrongly judging and heavily sentencing. People's representatives coming to inspect and help us discover errors and shortcomings in our work is something every worker welcomes. But we don't understand why Representatives Huang and Tan never asked a single question like "Have any bad people been wrongly released, or any counter-revolutionaries been leniently let off?" We never heard them ask about the situation of counter-revolutionary activities in Shanghai, or whether the suppression of counter-revolutionaries was thorough enough. They seemed completely uninterested in such a major issue of the struggle between ourselves and the enemy. On the contrary, they painstakingly searched for faults in judicial work. When inspecting the Procuratorate, they asked, "How many wrongly judged cases have been discovered by the court?" When inspecting the court, they repeatedly asked: "Has the Procuratorate violated the arrest and detention regulations by detaining criminals? Have there been any cases of indictments that should not have been prosecuted?" What exactly are their intentions?

The article pointed out: Huang Shaohong and Tan Tiwu both made some remarks during the inspection that violated socialist legality. Huang Shaohong said at an inspection symposium: "Even for counter-revolutionaries who deserve the death penalty, if they have family burdens, the government will still have to provide relief to their families after the death penalty is imposed. Is this cost-effective, and is it in line with the interests of the state?" During the inspection, Tan Tiwu said that a major active KMT secret agent case that had been cracked before any damage was done had been sentenced too heavily. The reason was: "They hadn't started their activities yet." Another counter-revolutionary had repeatedly "accused" revolutionary patriots and progressive people before liberation, with significant crimes, and refused to confess after liberation. The court sentenced him to imprisonment according to law, but Tan Tiwu passionately defended him, saying, "This was not intentional framing, but a general work-related behavior."

The article by these two judicial workers also revealed: "Huang Shaohong used to be a powerful figure in a province of the Kuomintang reactionary government. During his tenure, countless revolutionary patriots and progressive youths were massacred and persecuted in that province. Tan Tiwu was also a powerful figure with Huang Shaohong at that time. At that time, did they ever think of the 'families ruined and displaced' of these revolutionary patriots and progressive youths who were massacred and persecuted by the counter-revolutionaries?" The article said: "In fact, many counter-revolutionaries intimately called Huang Shaohong 'Mr. Jikuan,' and all brought up old reactionary relationships to ask Huang Shaohong to 'speak for them' and 'redress their grievances.'" The article mentioned that a counter-revolutionary once wrote a letter to Huang Shaohong saying: "When you presided over Zhejiang Province before liberation, I was a small judicial chief in a certain county and met you several times... I am very impressed by your insightful opinions during your inspection of the judicial systems of Shanghai and Zhejiang this year." And said, "You are now also in a high position," therefore requesting Huang Shaohong to "appeal in Beijing" and "reverse the verdict" for him. After receiving this letter, Huang Shaohong sent it to the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and asked the General Office to forward it to the Shanghai Higher People's Court for handling. The article said, "Huang Shaohong not only clamored everywhere for counter-revolutionaries, opposing the people's suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but it is also said that he is 'setting fires' everywhere, deliberately saying that more than 90% of the suppressed counter-revolutionaries were former military and political personnel. Everyone knows that the People's Government is suppressing guilty counter-revolutionaries, not former military and political personnel. The only purpose of his saying this is to provoke their relationship with the People's Government."

    上海司法机关两干部揭露
    黄绍竑谭惕吾视察的秘密
    新华社上海30日电　两个司法工作人员昨天在上海“解放日报”著文揭穿黄绍竑、谭惕吾在视察上海司法工作中的秘密。根据他们的揭露，黄绍竑、谭惕吾在视察中，总是不愿意看成绩而是挑筋剔骨地找缺点，然后将缺点夸大，并且发表了一些违反社会主义法制的言论。
    司法工作人员吴宏泽、卓启民的文章中说，我们工作中的缺点，本来两个方面都有，即错放、轻判和错判、重判的两个方面。人民代表来视察，帮助我们发现工作上的错误、缺点，这是每个工作人员最欢迎的。但是我们不明白为什么黄、谭两代表从来没有问过一句“有没有放错过坏人，轻纵过反革命分子”的话，从没有听到他们问起上海反革命活动情况怎么样，反革命分子肃清得彻底不彻底。他们对这样重大的敌我斗争问题似乎丝毫不感兴趣。相反地，他们倒是苦心孤诣地寻找司法工作中的毛病。他们在检察院视察时就问“发现法院错判案件多少？”在法院视察时就反复地问：“检察院有无违反逮捕拘留条例羁押人犯的事情？有没有不该起诉的起诉了？”这究竟是什么用心呢？
    文章中指出：黄绍竑、谭惕吾在视察时都发表过一些违反社会主义法制的言论。黄绍竑在视察座谈会上曾这样讲过：“即使罪该判处死刑的反革命分子，如果他有家庭生活负担的话，判了死刑，政府还要救济其家属，是否合算，是不是合乎国家利益？”谭惕吾在视察时，对一个尚未来得及破坏而已被破获的重大现行派遣特务分子被判处了重刑，说是判得过重了。理由是：“还没有开始活动”。另一个反革命分子解放前曾多次“控告”革命志士和进步人士，罪行显著，解放后又拒不交代。法院依法判处徒刑，而谭惕吾竟为他热衷地辩解说，“这不是有意陷害，而是一般职务行为”。
    这两个司法工作人员的文中还揭露说：“黄绍竑过去曾经是国民党反动政府在一个省的当权者，在他当政的时期，这个省有无数革命志士、进步青年被屠杀、被迫害。谭惕吾也是当时与黄绍竑在一起的当权人物。那时候，他们是否想起过这些被反革命屠杀、迫害的革命志士、进步青年的‘家破人亡、流离失所’呢？”文章说：“事实上，有不少反革命分子亲密地称黄绍竑为‘季宽先生’，并都拉上反动旧关系要求黄绍竑替他们‘鸣冤’、‘平反’”。文章提到，有一个反革命分子曾经写信给黄绍竑说：“解放前当您主持浙江省时期，我是某县的司法小首长，曾和您见过几次面……今年您视察沪、浙司法，发表卓见，无任欣佩。”并说：“你现在也身居要职”，因此要求黄绍竑为他“在北京呼吁”“翻案”。黄绍竑接到这封信以后，把它送给全国人民代表大会常务委员会办公厅，并要办公厅转上海高等法院处理。文章说，“黄绍竑不仅替反革命分子到处叫嚣，反对人民镇压反革命分子，据说他还到处‘放火’，故意说被镇压的反革命分子中有90％以上都是旧军政人员。谁都知道，人民政府镇压的是有罪恶的反革命分子，绝不是旧军政人员。他这样说法，无非是想挑拨他们和人民政府的关系而已。”
