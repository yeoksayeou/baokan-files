    Huang Shaohong Was the Murderer of Comrade Liu Ying
    Cheng Zhaoxiu, a Farmer from Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province, Says: I am a Witness.

    Comrade Editor:
    I am writing to expose a crime committed by Huang Shaohong.
    Previously, many people only knew that Comrade Liu Ying, the former Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Zhang Guiqing, the Secretary of the Wenzhou Municipal Committee, were killed by the Kuomintang. But who killed them? Few people know. Now I tell you that the rightist Huang Shaohong was the murderer of these two comrades, and I am a witness.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Huang Shaohong was the Chairman of the Kuomintang's Zhejiang Provincial Government. When the Japanese devils were about to reach the capital of Zhejiang Province, Huang Shaohong hurriedly took his henchmen and fled to Fangyan Township in Yongkang County, hiding in the caves of Fangyan Mountain. After arriving in Fangyan Township, Huang Shaohong did not fight the Japanese devils, but instead arrested and killed communists and revolutionary people in large numbers. Comrade Liu Ying, the leader of the Communist Party in the Zhejiang-Fujian border region who insisted on resisting Japan, and Comrade Zhang Guiqing, the Secretary of the Wenzhou Municipal Committee, were arrested by Chen Jiabi, the head of Huang Shaohong's secret service, on February 8, 1942, in Yongjia and Longyou.
    After Comrade Liu Ying was押送 [escorted] to Fangyan, he was initially imprisoned upstairs in the Cheng Hongpin Inn (this house was used as a prison by Huang Shaohong), only a few empty house foundations away from my home. Comrade Zhang Guiqing and a dozen other people were imprisoned in the Cheng family ancestral hall's prison. During this time, I was also arrested and imprisoned three times because I violated Huang Shaohong's ban on carrying manure to the fields. Once, I was imprisoned with Comrade Liu Ying. When Comrade Liu Ying saw me, he asked me why I was also imprisoned. I told him the reason for my imprisonment. Comrade Liu Ying said: You are people who wear straw sandals, don't confront these people head-on… Even at such a time, Comrade Liu Ying still cared about us farmers.
    I know a lot about Huang Shaohong's various persecutions of Comrade Liu Ying. Initially, Huang Shaohong used soft tactics. I heard that he sent Liu Yisheng, the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Investigation and Statistics Office and head of the secret service, and Cheng, the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, to talk to Comrade Liu Ying, attempting to induce Comrade Liu Ying to surrender. But they were all cursed back by Comrade Liu Ying. Comrade Liu Ying said: "You will not get anything from my mouth, you are not qualified to talk about politics with me."
    When soft methods failed, Huang Shaohong switched to hard methods—interrogating all night. As soon as it got dark, Huang Shaohong's henchmen would take Comrade Liu Ying for interrogation, and only send him back when it was almost dawn. I heard that once when Liu Yisheng interrogated Comrade Liu Ying, he said: "Gu Zhutong has sent a telegram, asking you to express your attitude; otherwise…" Comrade Liu Ying's answer was: "This is my attitude."
    After the interrogation failed, Huang Shaohong locked Comrade Liu Ying in Wanjingkuo in Shoushan Pit, Fangyan (this was an execution ground where Huang Shaohong massacred communists), and used cruel torture. It just so happened that the prison I was staying in this time was next to Comrade Liu Ying's prison, and I could see from the window that Comrade Liu Ying's feet were wearing heavy shackles, and his body had been tortured beyond recognition. Comrade Zhang Guiqing was also tortured until he vomited blood every day because he had always refused to surrender. Even at such a time, Comrade Liu Ying still encouraged other comrades in the prison to persevere in the struggle. From then on, I clearly knew that Comrade Liu Ying was a truly staunch and unyielding hero for the people and for the resistance against Japan. After returning home, I often thought of Comrade Liu Ying. At that time, the farmers in Zhai Liu Village, Fangyan Township, although they did not yet know that Comrades Liu Ying and Zhang Guiqing were communists, everyone said behind their backs that these people were good people, people with backbone.
    In May 1942, the Japanese devils reached Yongkang County, and Huang Shaohong hurriedly fled to Yunhe. Before fleeing, Huang Shaohong instructed his henchmen to be sure to kill Liu Ying and Zhang Guiqing. On the evening of May 17th, when Comrade Liu Ying was brought back from his last interrogation before his death, he gave one of his coats to an old woman who lived next to the prison and had boiled medicine and brought boiled water for Comrade Liu Ying and others. Comrade Liu Ying also said to the old woman: "Old Mother, thank you for taking care of me, I am here tonight to say goodbye to you." On the early morning of May 18th, before dawn, several gunshots rang out on the small mountain on the left side of the Cheng Clan Ancestral Hall in Zhai Liu Village. Comrades Liu Ying and Zhang Guiqing were killed by Huang Shaohong in this way.
    After the executioners left, I buried the bodies of Comrades Liu Ying and Zhang Guiqing on Zhai Liu Mountain, and planted a small cypress tree in front of the tombs of these two martyrs.
    I am very saddened when I think of this. Please think about it: How should we avenge Comrade Liu Ying and Comrade Zhang Guiqing? How should we treat Huang Shaohong, this executioner?
    Cheng Zhaoxiu, Zhai Liu Village, Fangyan Township, Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province

### 杀害刘英同志的是黄绍竑  浙江永康县农民程兆修说：我是见证人。

    杀害刘英同志的是黄绍竑
    浙江永康县农民程兆修说：我是见证人。编辑同志：
    这里要揭露黄绍竑一桩罪行。
    在这以前，许多人只知道前中共浙江省委书记刘英同志和温州市委书记张贵卿同志被国民党杀害了。可是谁杀害他的？知道的人不多了。现在告诉你，杀害这两位同志的就是右派分子黄绍竑，我是见证人。
    抗日战争时，黄绍竑是国民党的浙江省主席，日本鬼子快打到浙江省会的时候，黄绍竑赶忙带着自己的爪牙逃到永康县方岩乡，躲在方岩山的岩洞里。到了方岩乡，黄绍竑并不去打日本鬼子，而是大批大批地捕杀共产党员和革命的人民。在浙闽边区坚持抗日的共产党领导人、中共浙江省委书记刘英同志和温州市委书记张贵卿同志，就是被黄绍竑手下的特务头子陈家璧于1942年2月8日在永嘉和龙游捕去的。
    刘英同志被押到方岩以后，最初被关在程洪品宿店楼上（这房子被黄绍竑作为监牢），离我的家只隔几间空屋基。张贵卿同志是同其他十几个人被关在程宅祠堂的牢房里。在这个时光里，我因为挑粪下地违反了黄绍竑的禁令，也被拉去坐了三回班房。有一回，同刘英同志关在一起。刘英同志一见我，就问我为什么也被关押起来？我就把被关的原因说了一下。刘英同志说：你们是穿草鞋的人，不要和这些人硬干。……在这样的时候，刘英同志还这样关心我们农民。
    黄绍竑对刘英同志的种种迫害，我知道得不少。最初，黄绍竑用软的手段，听说派了浙江省调查统计室主任、特务头子刘怡生和浙江省民政厅长程某同刘英同志谈话，企图诱骗刘英同志自首。但是都被刘英同志骂了回去。刘英同志说：“你们不会从我口里得到什么的，你们没有资格同我谈政治。”
    软的办法不行，黄绍竑就改用硬的办法——整夜审讯。一到天黑，黄绍竑的爪牙就把刘英同志带去审讯，直到天快亮的时候才送回来。听人说：有一次刘怡生审讯刘英同志的时候说：“顾祝同有电报来，叫你表示态度；否则就要……”刘英同志回答是：“我就是这样的态度。”
    审讯失败后，黄绍竑把刘英同志关到方岩寿山坑万静廓（这里是黄绍竑屠杀共产党人的一个刑场），动了酷刑。刚好这一次我住的班房就在刘英同志班房的隔壁，从窗户可以看见刘英同志双脚带上了一副大脚镣，身体已经被折磨得不像样子。张贵卿同志也因为一直不屈服被折磨得天天吐血。就在这样的时候，刘英同志还在牢里鼓励其他的同志坚持斗争。从这以后，我才清楚地知道刘英同志是一条真正为了人民、为了抗日的坚贞不屈的硬汉。回家后，我常常想念刘英同志。当时，方岩乡宅六村的农民，虽然还不知道刘英和张贵卿两位同志是共产党员，但是大家背后都说这些人是好人，是硬骨头。
    1942年5月，日本鬼子打到了永康县，黄绍竑赶忙向云和逃跑。在逃跑前，黄绍竑指示自己的爪牙一定要杀死刘英和张贵卿。5月17日晚上，刘英同志在就义前最后一次被传审回来的时候，将自己的一件大衣送给了一位住在班房隔壁的、给刘英等同志煎过药送过开水的老太太。刘英同志还对这位老太太说：“老妈妈，谢谢你照顾过我，今天晚上我来同你告别了。”5月18日清早，天还没大亮，宅六村程氏宗祠左边的小山上响了几响枪声，刘英、张贵卿同志就这样被黄绍竑杀害了。
    等刽子手走完以后，我才把刘英、张贵卿同志的尸体掩埋在宅六山上，在这两位烈士的墓前栽了一棵小柏树。
    想起这件事情，我是很悲痛的。请大家想想：应该怎样来为刘英同志和张贵卿同志报仇？应该怎样来对待黄绍竑这个刽子手？
