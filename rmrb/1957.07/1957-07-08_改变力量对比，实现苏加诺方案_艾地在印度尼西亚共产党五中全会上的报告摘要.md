Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th - Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, delivered a report on behalf of the Central Political Bureau entitled "Changing the Balance of Power and 100% Realizing President Sukarno's Plan" at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, which began on July 4th.

Aidit's report is divided into four parts: the political situation, Sukarno's plan, mass work, and the first three-year plan for organizational and educational work. The full text of the report has been published in the Jakarta "People's Daily" on July 5th.

		Political Situation

Aidit, in discussing the political situation since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party in July 1956, said that the relationship and cooperation between the anti-colonial forces in the Asian-African region and the socialist camp have become increasingly close. The international united front against war and colonialism not only continues to be maintained but has also undergone new developments.

Aidit pointed out that imperialists, headed by the United States, are doing everything possible to undermine this cooperative relationship and the position of socialist countries. However, the bankruptcy of the imperialists and reactionaries of various countries' conspiracy to use the Hungarian incident to attack the Communist Parties of relevant countries, the brilliant victories of the Italian Communist Party and the Indian Communist Party in the general election, and the brilliant victory of the Indonesian Communist Party in the Jakarta local parliamentary election are vivid examples of the failure of the imperialists.

Aidit said that the maintenance and strengthening of the worldwide anti-colonial and anti-war united front provides many good possibilities for the Indonesian people in developing the national struggle and realizing the struggle to abolish the Round Table Conference Agreement, improve the national economy, and recover West Irian. It should continue to be noted that we must be more vigilant against the subversive activities of the imperialists. This struggle is an important part of defending national independence and defending peace.

Aidit, when discussing the current domestic situation in Indonesia, said that since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Party has been implementing such a political line, that is, to strengthen and continuously develop progressive forces, unite middle forces, and isolate die-hard forces. The domestic political situation shows that the people's revolutionary movement and the development of democracy have made the progressive forces and the middle forces more and more united, while making the die-hard forces more and more isolated.

The organization of transitional local councils based on the decrees passed by the people-elected parliament is a very important political event in the Party's struggle to develop and consolidate democracy, enabling the Party to participate in deciding some issues of local government through its representatives.

The transitional local council is an important tool for the collective cooperation between the Indonesian Communist Party and other parties, which gives the Party the opportunity to prove to the people that the Indonesian Communist Party's program and actions are consistent and are to safeguard and be loyal to the interests of the local people. And the masks of those parties that do not safeguard the interests of the people will be exposed.

Aidit said that therefore, the reactionary groups are very worried about the upcoming local parliamentary elections, and they are trying their best to delay the organization of local councils.

Aidit said that the balance of power in the Constitutional Assembly has given the people great confidence in democracy. For the Party, it is extremely important to mobilize the masses to demand the formulation of a constitution whose content and spirit conform to the will of the Indonesian people of the August 1945 Revolution. The Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia should be a unified, fully independent and democratic constitution.

Aidit said that due to the fear of the expansion of the democratic movement and the upsurge of the people's anti-colonialist patriotic spirit, the reactionaries headed by Hatta, Natsir of the Masyumi Party, and leading figures of the Indonesian Socialist Party, are trying their best to reduce the significance of the parliament and deliberately overthrow the current parliament. They are trying their best to advocate the organization of a presidential cabinet. Their political beliefs have turned from parliamentary democracy to fascism.

In order to obstruct the development of democracy, the reactionaries have adopted various methods to attempt to divide the unity of the Indonesian people, such as provoking relations between nationalities, between the military and political parties, etc. They also cooperated with foreign subversive elements and used soldiers under their control to block the tide of democracy and the people's revolutionary movement, creating the "August 13th" incident last year, the Lubis coup conspiracy, incidents in Central Sumatra, South Sumatra, North Sumatra, and Sulawesi, etc., which greatly increased domestic unrest and hindered the implementation of the country's constructive measures.

The reactionaries also exhausted the country's financial resources by launching armed activities, destroying the country's resources, organizing smuggling activities, and allowing bureaucracy and corruption to spread, which seriously weakened the position of the Republic of Indonesia.

Aidit said that in order to prevent the collapse of the Republic of Indonesia, the plan announced by President Sukarno is very important. The actions taken by the masses across the country to support this plan, such as holding demonstrations and mass rallies, are expressions of anti-colonialist, patriotic desires for unity and unification. The forces formed after the announcement of the President's plan greatly helped to prevent the possibility of a rightward turn due to the crisis of the Ali-Idham cabinet (ie the Second Sastroamidjojo Cabinet).

Aidit said that due to the stubborn attitude of the Masyumi Party and the indecisive attitude of the Nahdlatul Ulama, the current Juanda Cabinet is not the cooperative cabinet hoped for in Sukarno's plan, but the reactionaries' attempt to organize a cabinet with Hatta as prime minister has been completely defeated. The Masyumi Party has also been completely excluded from the cabinet.

Aidit said that the Party's attitude towards the Juanda Cabinet is to unreservedly support its actions that are beneficial to the people, criticize its indecisive actions, and oppose its actions that harm the people, while focusing on support. If it has actions that violate the interests of the people, it will be resolved through consultation.

Aidit said that during the reign of the Juanda Cabinet, there were signs of improvement in the political and military situation. Generally speaking, democratic and revolutionary forces are developing, except in those areas ruled by rebels. On the road to overcoming domestic military and financial difficulties, we do not make excessive demands on the government. It is only required to earnestly implement one of its programs, that is, to continue to implement the abolition of the Round Table Conference Agreement and take measures that are beneficial to the Indonesian people in dealing with Dutch capitalists.

Aidit said that it is the task of all members of the Indonesian Communist Party to fully support the implementation of the government's policy program.

		Sukarno's Plan

Aidit said when talking about President Sukarno's plan, the enlarged meeting of the Central Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party held in February this year expressed its approval of Sukarno's plan and called on all the Indonesian people to wholeheartedly support this plan and strive to realize this plan. Sukarno's plan is a just, democratic plan that guarantees unity and opposes division, and is a plan to unite all possible forces to complete the national revolution, because it points out the necessity for the Indonesian Communist Party to participate in the central government. Sukarno's plan advocates a sounder democracy, and it does not violate the parliamentary system and the party system.

Aidit said that the reason why the Indonesian Communist Party approves of the cooperative cabinet is that the Party has long demanded the organization of a national unity government or a national coalition government as a condition for uniting and mobilizing the strength of the entire nation to the greatest extent. The Fourth Plenary Session held in July last year has clearly summarized our political demands as follows: defeat the anti-unity policy and anti-communist dictatorship policy of some leaders of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party, so as to form a national coalition government jointly participated by the four major parties (Indonesian Communist Party, Indonesian Nationalist Party, Nahdlatul Ulama, and Masyumi Party) and other parties. This requirement is the political requirement of the current stage -- the stage of maintaining national independence and developing democracy. This is the declaration of the wishes, thoughts, and feelings of the majority of the Indonesian people at present.

Aidit said that the reason why we approve of the National Council is that with the National Council, the President will be able to directly listen to the wishes, thoughts, and feelings of the masses of the people and discuss them collectively. As an advisory body, the National Council will be very helpful to the work of the government. The National Council is a new political means grasped by the people in the struggle against colonialism, defending democracy, and peace.

Aidit said that Sukarno's plan has inspired the people deeply and widely. It has also drawn a dividing line between the united camp that approves of anti-colonialism and the camp that opposes unity and approves of colonialism. This plan has enabled the people to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and has carried out an extremely important political education for the masses of the people. Although the plan has not yet been implemented, its mere announcement has already caused some changes in the balance of power in society, and most of the middle forces have openly stood on the side of the progressive camp. Greater divisions have also emerged within the die-hard parties.

The reason why this plan cannot be implemented or cannot be fully implemented at present is not because it is incorrect, but because of factors in the balance of power. Sukarno's plan will surely become a reality. To this end, the Indonesian Communist Party will be with the entire Indonesian people and continue to take action to ensure that Sukarno's plan is fully implemented.

Aidit said that as a condition for implementing Sukarno's plan, we must continue to publicize this plan continuously, continuously organize the people's strength, and continuously change the balance of power. At the same time, it is still the Party's responsibility to publicize the Party's general program -- a program to thoroughly realize the requirements of the August Revolution.

		Mass Work

Aidit reviewed the Party's work among workers, peasants, women, intellectuals, youth, students, and veterans when talking about launching mass work. Aidit believes that the unity of workers has been strengthened, peasants have gained experience in the struggle against landlords, and peasant organizations have been further expanded and strengthened. There have also been achievements in the work among intellectuals and other aspects.

Aidit said that however, the Party often only pays attention to workers and peasants when leading mass movements, and does not pay enough attention to the work in other aspects such as youth and students. He said that it is necessary to further strengthen assistance to the People's Youth League and pay attention to the work of veterans. Aidit pointed out that all Party organizations must be mobilized to launch mass work, so that no people's group can be left unattended by the Party. This is a condition for changing the current balance of power, realizing the President's plan, and establishing cooperative cabinets and democratic local governments.

		Three-Year Plan

Aidit said when talking about the issue of organizational and educational work in the three-year plan, the first three-year plan for organizational and educational work adopted by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee greatly helped the Party's construction work. The three-year plan enables Party cadres to see further, enabling them to carry out many aspects of work at the same time in a certain period, and enabling them to learn not to deviate when performing Party tasks.

Aidit called for re-launching the competition movement between Party organizations and between Party members in the realization of the three-year plan.

Aidit finally called for continuing to strengthen Party unity. He said that Party unity is a condition for the unity of the working class, the unity of the working people, the unity of the entire Indonesian people and the Indonesian nation, is an effective weapon for changing the balance of social forces, and is an indispensable condition for realizing Sukarno's plan.

    改变力量对比，实现苏加诺方案
    艾地在印度尼西亚共产党五中全会上的报告摘要
    新华社雅加达6日电　印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在7月4日开始举行的印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第五次全体会议上，代表中央政治局作了题为“改变力量对比，百分之百地实现苏加诺总统方案”的报告。
    艾地的报告分为政治局势、苏加诺方案、群众工作和关于组织和教育工作的第一个三年计划等四个部分。报告全文已经刊载在7月5日的雅加达“人民日报”上。
              政治局势
    艾地在谈到从1956年7月印度尼西亚共产党举行中央委员会第四次全体会议以来的政治局势说，亚非地区的反殖民主义力量同社会主义阵营之间的关系和合作已经日益密切。反战争反殖民主义的国际统一战线不仅继续保持着，而且有了新的发展。
    艾地指出，以美国为首的帝国主义分子极力想破坏这种合作关系和社会主义国家的地位。但是，帝国主义分子和各国反动分子企图利用匈牙利事件来打击有关国家的共产党的阴谋的破产，意大利共产党和印度共产党在普选中的辉煌胜利，和印度尼西亚共产党在雅加达地方议会选举中的辉煌胜利，都是帝国主义分子失败的生动的例证。
    艾地说，全世界反殖民主义和反战争的统一战线的保持和加强，对印度尼西亚人民在发展民族斗争以及实现废除圆桌会议协定和改善国家经济、收复西伊里安等斗争，提供了许多良好的可能性。应该继续注意的是，必须更加警惕帝国主义分子的颠覆活动。这个斗争是保卫民族独立、保卫和平的重要组成部分。
    艾地在谈到目前印度尼西亚国内的形势的时候说，在印度尼西亚共产党四中全会以来，党一直执行着这样的政治路线，即加强和不断发展进步力量、团结中间力量和孤立顽固力量。国内的政治形势表明，人民革命运动和民主的发展已经使进步力量和中间力量越来越团结，而使顽固力量越来越孤立。
    根据由人民选举的国会所通过的法令组织过渡性地方议会，在党的发展和巩固民主的斗争中是一个非常重要的政治事件，使党有可能通过它的代表参与决定地方政府的一些问题。
    过渡性地方议会是印度尼西亚共产党和其它党派集体合作的重要工具，它使党有机会向人民证实：印度尼西亚共产党的政纲和行动是一致的，是维护和忠实于地方人民利益的。而那些不维护人民利益的政党的假面具将被揭露。
    艾地说，因此，反动集团对于即将举行的地方议会选举非常担忧，他们正在竭力拖延组织地方议会。
    艾地说，制宪议会中的力量对比已经使人民对民主产生了极大的信心。对党来说，发动人民群众要求制订一个内容和精神符合于1945年8月革命的印度尼西亚人民的意志的宪法是极为重要的。印度尼西亚共和国的宪法应该是统一的、充分独立和民主的宪法。
    艾地说，由于担心民主运动的扩展和人民反殖民主义的爱国精神的高涨，以哈达、马斯友美党的纳席尔和印度尼西亚社会党领导人物为首的反动派，竭力想缩小国会的意义，并且蓄意推翻目前的国会。他们竭力主张组织总统制内阁。他们的政治信仰已经由议会民主转向法西斯主义。
    为了阻挠民主的发展，反动派采取各种方法企图分化印度尼西亚人民的团结，如挑拨民族间的关系、军队间和政党间的关系等。他们并且和外国颠覆活动分子合作，利用在他们控制下的军人来堵塞民主的潮流和人民的革命运动，制造了去年的“八一三”事件，卢比斯政变阴谋，中苏门答腊、南苏门答腊、北苏门答腊和苏拉威西等事件，使国内的骚乱大为增加，使国家的建设性的措施的实施受到阻碍。
    反动派并且通过发动武装分子的活动、破坏国家的资源、组织走私活动、让官僚主义和贪污作风蔓延等办法，使国家的资财消耗殆尽，相当严重地削弱了印度尼西亚共和国的地位。
    艾地说，为了防止印度尼西亚共和国的崩溃，苏加诺总统宣布的方案是非常重要的。全国各地群众为支持这个方案而采取的举行示威游行和群众大会等行动是反殖民主义的、爱国的、要求团结和统一的愿望的表现。在总统方案公布后形成的力量大大有助于防止由于阿里—伊达姆内阁（即第二届沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁）的危机而向右转的可能。
    艾地说，由于马斯友美党的顽固态度和伊斯兰教师联合会的不坚决态度，现在的朱安达内阁并不是符合总统方案所希望的合作内阁，但是，反动派的想组织以哈达为总理的内阁的企图已经遭到全面失败。马斯友美党也被完全排除在内阁之外。
    艾地说，党对朱安达内阁的态度是无保留地支持它的对人民有利的行动，批评它的不坚决的行动，反对它的损害人民的行动，而着重在支持方面。如果它有违反人民利益的行动，则以协商的方法来解决。
    艾地说，在朱安达内阁执政过程中，政治和军事形势有好转的迹象。除了那些叛乱者所统治的地区以外，一般地说来，民主力量和革命力量是发展的。在克服国内军事和财政经济困难的道路上，我们并不向政府作过分的要求。只要求它认真地执行它的政纲之一，即继续实施废除圆桌会议协定，在对待荷兰大资本家方面采取有利于印度尼西亚人民的措施。
    艾地说，全力支持政府的施政纲领的实施，是印度尼西亚共产党全体党员的任务。
    苏加诺方案
    艾地在谈到苏加诺总统方案时说，今年2月召开的印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局扩大会议表示赞成苏加诺的方案，并且呼吁全体印度尼西亚人民全心全意支持这一方案，为实现这个方案而努力。苏加诺方案是公正的、民主的、保证团结和反对分裂的，是以团结一切可能团结的力量来完成民族革命的方案，因为它指出印度尼西亚共产党参加中央政府的必要。　　苏加诺方案主张有更健全的民主，他没有侵犯国会制度和政党制度。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党之所以赞成合作内阁，是因为党早已要求组织民族团结政府或民族联合政府，作为团结和最大限度地动员全体民族力量的条件。在去年7月召开的四中全会已经明白地把我们的政治要求归纳如下：击败马斯友美党——印度尼西亚社会党部分领袖的反团结政策和反共独裁政策，以组成四大政党（印度尼西亚共产党、印度尼西亚国民党、伊斯兰教师联合会和马斯友美党）及其他党派共同参加的民族联合政府。这一要求是现阶段——维护民族独立和发展民主的阶段——的政治要求。这是目前印度尼西亚大部分人民的愿望、思想和情感的宣告。
    艾地说，我们所以赞成民族委员会，是因为有了民族委员会总统将能够直接倾听人民群众的愿望、思想和感情，并且能够集体地加以讨论。作为顾问机构的民族委员会将非常有助于政府的工作。民族委员会是人民在反殖民主义、维护民主和和平的斗争中所掌握的新的政治手段。
    艾地说，苏加诺方案已经深入而广泛地鼓舞了人民。它也划下了赞成反殖民主义的团结阵营和反对团结而赞成殖民主义的阵营之间的分界线。这个方案已经使人民能分清敌我，已经对人民群众进行了一次极为重要的政治教育。虽然方案仍未执行，但是单是它的公布就已经引起社会中力量对比的一些变化，大部分的中间力量已经公开地站到进步阵营方面。在顽固党派的内部也已经产生了更大的分裂。
    这个方案目前如果还不能实施或不能够完全实施，这并不是因为它不正确，而是由于力量对比的因素所造成的。苏加诺方案必将成为事实。为此，印度尼西亚共产党将和印度尼西亚全体人民在一起，继续采取行动以使苏加诺方案得到完全实施。
    艾地说，作为实施苏加诺方案的条件，我们必须继续不断地宣传这个方案，不断地把人民力量组织起来，不断地去改变力量的对比。同时，宣传党的一般纲领——彻底实现八月革命的要求的纲领，仍然是党的责任。
    群众工作
    艾地在谈到展开群众工作时检查了党在工人、农民、妇女、知识分子和青年学生以及退伍军人中的工作。艾地认为工人的团结已经加强，农民在同地主的斗争中取得了经验，农民组织已经更加扩大和加强。在知识分子等方面的工作也有成绩。
    艾地说，但是，党在领导群众运动时常常只注意到工人和农民，而对青年学生等其它方面的工作注意不够。他说，必须进一步加强对人民青年团的帮助，并且注意退伍军人工作。艾地指出，所有的党组织必须动员起来展开群众工作，不使一个人民集团得不到党的注意。这是改变现在力量对比、实现总统方案和成立合作内阁和民主的地方政府的条件。
    三年计划
    艾地在谈到关于三年计划中的组织和教育工作问题时说，中央委员会第四次全体会议通过的关于组织和教育工作的第一个三年计划大大有助于党的建设工作。三年计划将教育党的干部看得更远，使他们能在某一个时期内同时进行多方面的工作，并且使他们学会在执行党的任务时不出偏差。
    艾地号召在实现三年计划中重新展开党的组织之间和党员之间的竞赛运动。
    艾地最后号召继续加强党内团结。他说，党内团结是工人阶级的团结、劳动人民的团结、全体印度尼西亚人民和印度尼西亚民族的团结的条件，是改变社会力量对比的有效武器，是实现苏加诺方案不可缺少的条件。
