Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 8th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Shi Zhengzhang reports: In some places in the mountainous area of southern Anhui Province, there is a good method for maintaining draught cattle. After the summer plowing tasks are completed, farmers send the draught cattle to high mountains for grazing, allowing them to spend a leisurely vacation.

Recently, the reporter saw hundreds of draught cattle from Shangzhuang, Yuchuan and other agricultural cooperatives in Jixi County taking vacations on high mountain pastures. This year, the pasture grass is growing very lushly, which can supply the draught cattle with a hearty meal for more than two months. Every day before the sun rises, the caretakers get up to count the number of draught cattle, and then set off to graze, taking care of the cattle eating grass and preventing them from falling off cliffs. In the evening, they gather the cattle together, count them again, and then fire guns and beat gongs to drive away wild animals and ensure the safety of the cattle. The cattle also live a very regular life in the mountains. They go out and return in groups during the day, and sleep in a circle at night, with their tails facing inward and their heads facing outward, to defend against tigers, leopards and other beasts of prey.

After the end of summer plowing in the mountainous area of southern Anhui, the weather is hot in the mountains, and there are many mosquitoes and horseflies, which bite the draught cattle so that they cannot cope. At this time, the climate is cool and the grass is lush in the high mountains, and there are no mosquitoes and horseflies, which is a good place for draught cattle to escape the summer heat. Therefore, many farmers put their draught cattle on the pastures in the high mountains in summer; until the autumn is cool, each draught cattle has been raised to be fat and strong, and then they return to participate in the autumn plowing.

    保养耕牛的好方法
    耕牛上山度暑假
    据新华社合肥8日电　新华社记者石正章报道：安徽省皖南山区有些地方有一种保养耕牛的好方法，就是在夏耕任务完成以后，农民们把耕牛送上高山放牧，让它们度过一个悠闲的假期。
    最近，记者在绩溪县上庄、余川等农业社，看到社里的几百头耕牛正在高山牧场上休假。今年这些牧场上牧草长得很茂盛，可以供耕牛痛痛快快地吃两个多月。每天太阳还没有升起，看管的人们就起来清点耕牛的数目，然后出发放牧，照顾耕牛吃草，防止耕牛坠入悬崖陡壁之下。傍晚，他们便把牛群集中起来，再清点一次，然后鸣枪敲锣，驱逐野兽，保障耕牛的安全。牛群在山上生活也很有规律。它们白天群出群归，晚上睡成一个圆圈，尾朝内，头朝外，防御虎豹等猛兽来犯。
    皖南山区夏耕结束以后，山下天气炎热，蚊子和牛虻较多，咬得耕牛无法对付。而这时高山上气候凉爽，青草茂盛，没有蚊子和牛虻，是耕牛避暑的佳地。所以，很多农民一到夏天就把耕牛放到高山上的牧场；直到秋凉后每头耕牛都已养得膘肥力壮，才回去参加秋耕。
