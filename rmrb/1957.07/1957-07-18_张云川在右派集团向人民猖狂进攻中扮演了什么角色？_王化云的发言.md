I fully endorse the reports presented at this meeting, and I will strive to implement them diligently in my future work.

During the preparatory meeting, I also studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." My understanding of this creative Marxist-Leninist document is not yet profound, but I already feel that my vision is much clearer than before. I have a relatively clear understanding of the anti-people and anti-socialist conspiracies of the rightist group, and their criminal activities to restore capitalism. Today I want to talk about the role Zhang Yunchuan, who served the Zhang-Luo alliance, played in the rightist group's frenzied attack on the people.

He described the Party's work as completely dark, vilified Party members, and slandered activists.

Zhang Yunchuan is a representative to the National People's Congress elected from Henan Province. He is a member of the Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, and also a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and Deputy Secretary-General of the Democratic League. Needless to say, he is a figure of some importance. Like his big bosses, he waved the banner of helping the Communist Party with rectification, and shot cold arrows at the people. At the symposium for democratic personages held by the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, he, like other rightists with ulterior motives, said that affirming achievements based on facts was a "formula," and that those who spoke of achievements were insincere and telling lies. What does this mean? Is it that they want to shut the people's mouths and allow this small group of people to act recklessly, distort right and wrong, and turn black into white, in order to achieve their goal of portraying the People's China as completely dark? If not, then on what basis did he say that walls and ditches were created by the privileged thinking of Party members, slandering Party members as standing on the heads of the masses, having revolutionary privileges, that big and small cadres are big and small officials, and that officialdom is full of bureaucracy and strict hierarchy, etc.? Among Party members and cadres, there are undoubtedly people with poor work styles, but this is a minority, or even an extremely small minority. Precisely because there are shortcomings and errors, the Party is carrying out rectification in order to correct them. This should be said to be the greatest and most glorious action. But in Zhang Yunchuan's mouth, the individual and the partial became the comprehensive and the entire. Here, Zhang Yunchuan is particularly dissatisfied with activists, saying that activists are volunteer teams for building walls and digging ditches, using the most vicious words to scold activists as Tang Qin (the treacherous villain under Yan Shifan in the play "Trial and Assassination of Tang"). Later, he felt that this was too blatant, so he declared that the false activists he was talking about were the activists of the democratic parties. But we know that the false activists he was talking about are the true activists we are talking about. Please see how he accuses the Party: it only believes in a small number of people, treats them as activists, and relies on them to speak irresponsibly, ranking who is progressive and who is backward, and isolating the Party from the masses... But the Party trusts them, encourages them, and says they are active, progressive, and close to the Party. From this, it can be seen how much Zhang Yunchuan hates those who are close to the Party. Zhang Yunchuan also attacked the Party's united front policy and united front work by using the story and characters of Liangshanpo, greatly complaining that Lu Junyi was given the second seat in Liangshanpo, and that Li Kui and Chai Jin were not valued, in order to provoke the relationship between democratic personages and our Party. What is particularly egregious is that when this view was criticized by everyone at this panel meeting, he pulled another representative outside the room and said, "The Li Kui I was talking about... refers to you leading troops to revolt and being arranged as a committee member, while Huang Qixiang didn't bring a single soldier or gun but was placed above you, I am speaking up for your injustice," and even carried out provocative activities on the spot. Why does Zhang Yunchuan only talk about shortcomings and not achievements in his work, and speak so badly of the vast number of cadres, Party members, and activists (including activists in the democratic parties) who work hard in various positions, making everything sound so bad? This is a major weapon for the rightists to carry out conspiracies and attack the people, because only by talking about shortcomings and not achievements can they vilify the Communist Party and the people's regime, making it easy to fabricate rumors and slanders, confuse right and wrong, and incite people's hearts, in order to achieve their ultimate goal: Since the People's China is full of bad people and bad things, why shouldn't you step down?!

In Zhengzhou, he actively collected right-wing lackeys and wholeheartedly carried out the task of the Zhang-Luo alliance's great expansion.

After completing the first offensive battle in Beijing, Zhang Yunchuan hurried to Zhengzhou to carry out the task of the Zhang-Luo alliance's great expansion, collecting scrap metal for Zhang and Luo as capital for competing for the world. In Zhengzhou, he promoted the situation of the great blooming and great contending at Peking University. He claimed that most of Lin Xiling's opinions were correct. Isn't this wanting to ignite the fire of opposition to socialism in Zhengzhou as well? When he arranged the development task, he instructed: "Don't develop the false activists who report to the Party." Who should be developed? Obviously, what they want to develop is still those anti-people rightists. Most of the targets Zhang Yunchuan personally sought were also such people. Why does he specifically look for these people, and what does he want to do by organizing these people? Please tell us what their purpose is. However, his trip was not very successful, because they misjudged the situation. Shortly after Zhang Yunchuan arrived in Zhengzhou, the people began to expose the conspiratorial activities of the rightist group. The People's Daily editorial was published on June 8. Seeing that the situation was not good, the right-wing leaders retreated on one hand and resisted on the other. No wonder Zhang Yunchuan wrote to Li Boqiu and Zhang Bojun complaining: "Seeing the news of the symposium of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party published in the People's Daily and Guangming Daily, and looking at the content, it is not about giving opinions to the Communist Party and helping with rectification, but it has turned into giving opinions to Zhang Yunchuan, becoming the rectification of the Peasants' and Workers' Party, which is very strange! You asked me to come to Zhengzhou to do things... When I am not present... it also makes people feel very uncomfortable." It can be said to be beyond Zhang Yunchuan's expectations, but Zhang Yunchuan was not willing to stop there, and continued to spread vicious remarks, expressing great sympathy for the rightists. When members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party asked him for instructions on their attitude towards the counterattack against the Zhang and Luo rightists in Beijing, he replied that it depends on who is looking at the fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds. It can be seen how clear and firm Zhang Yunchuan's reactionary stance is. Aren't anti-people "heroes" like Zhang Bojun and Ge Peiqi already being cheered by Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Associated Press? Zhang Yunchuan's speech has also been welcomed by Taiwan. But Zhang Yunchuan still hypocritically said that Zhang Bojun and Ge Peiqi's remarks have no market and there is no need to pursue them, while regarding the threatening letter received by Lu Yuwen, he asserted that "this is not true," in other words, the threatening letter was intentionally fabricated, and it was the people's conspiracy. How vicious this is! Who can say that Zhang Yunchuan's love and hatred are not clear?

During inspections, he often fabricated rumors and slanders, and reversed right and wrong.

Zhang Yunchuan's reactionary and absurd words and deeds are not accidental. During his many inspections in Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Xinjiang and other provinces and regions, he often said that most of the rural cadres are bad, and even deliberately fabricated lies such as the bark and leaves of trees being eaten up in disaster areas. When he arrived in that place, people asked him where the leaves on the trees came from, and he said, "I was talking about the past"; saying that people starved to death here, and people starved to death there, and people were also crushed to death buying grain, that the people looked hungry, and that 80% of the peasants were dissatisfied with the Party, etc. This means that they regard fabricating rumors and slanders and reversing right and wrong as the basis and strategy for realizing restoration. But if you do this, can you really achieve the goal of stealing the sky and changing the day? Can your ambitions really succeed?

I think this is completely a dream. The leadership of the Communist Party, the socialist road, and the people's world are as solid as a rock. Attempting to shake the foundation of the country is something that the people will never allow. I advise the rightist gentlemen to wake up and honestly confess your criminal words and deeds to the people!

### 张云川在右派集团向人民猖狂进攻中扮演了什么角色？  王化云的发言

专栏：

    张云川在右派集团向人民猖狂进攻中扮演了什么角色？
    王化云的发言
    我完全拥护本次会议上的各项报告，并且在今后工作中一定要努力贯彻执行。
    在预备会期间还学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，我对这个创造性的马列主义文献，理解得还不够深刻，但已感到自己的眼睛比以前亮了好多，对右派集团反人民反社会主义阴谋、使资本主义复辟的罪恶活动，有了较为清楚的认识。今天我想谈一谈为章罗联盟效力的张云川在右派集团向人民猖狂进攻中扮演了什么角色。
    他把党的工作说成一团漆黑，丑化党员，诬蔑积极分子
    张云川是我们河南省选出的人大代表，他是农工民主党中央执行局委员，又是民盟中央委员兼民盟副秘书长，不用说是一个不很小的人物，他和他的大头目们一样，打着帮助共产党整风的旗子，向人民大放冷箭。在中央统战部民主人士座谈会上，他和其他别有用心的右派分子一样，把实事求是的肯定成绩说是“公式”，把说成绩的人说是言不由衷、说假话。这是什么意思呢？是不是想封住人民的嘴，由他们这一小撮人任意胡作非为，颠倒是非，把黑的说成白的，以达到他们把人民中国说成漆黑一团的目的呢？如果不是这样，他又有什么根据说墙和沟是党员的特权思想造成，诬蔑党员站在群众头上，有革命的特权，大小干部是大小官，而且官气十足，官阶森严等等？在党员和干部中，无疑有作风不好的人，但这是少数，甚至于是极少数，并且正因为有缺点有错误，所以党才进行整风，以便改正，这应该说是最伟大、最光明的举动。可是在张云川嘴里就把个别的、局部的，变成了全面的、全体的。在这里张云川特别对积极分子不满，说积极分子是打墙挖沟的义勇队，用最恶毒的话骂积极分子是汤勤（审头刺汤剧中严世藩手下的奸险小人）。后来他感觉这说得太露骨了，所以又声明说我说的是假积极分子，是民主党派的积极分子。可是我们知道他说的假积极分子就是我们说的真积极分子，请看他指责党说：只相信少数的人，把他们当做积极分子，依靠他们信口雌黄，就把谁进步谁落后排了队，使党和群众隔离开来。……但是党却信任他们，鼓励他们，说他们积极、进步、靠拢党。从此可以看出张云川是如何的仇视靠拢党的人。张云川假借梁山泊的故事和人物对党的统战政策、统战工作也大肆攻击，很为卢俊义坐了梁山泊的第二把交椅，李逵、柴进不受重视，大鸣不平，以挑拨民主人士和我党的关系。尤其恶劣的是这种观点在此次小组会受到大家的批判时，他把另一位代表拉到室外说，我说的李逵……是指的你带兵起义，安排为委员，黄琪翔没带一兵一枪反摆在你上，是替你不平，竟然当场进行挑拨活动。张云川为什么对工作只说缺点不讲成绩，对我们在各种岗位上艰苦工作的广大干部、党员、积极分子（民主党派里的积极分子也好）说得那样坏，把一切都说得那样坏呢？这是右派分子进行阴谋活动、向人民进攻的一个大法宝，因为只讲缺点不讲成绩，就可以丑化共产党和人民政权，就便于造谣中伤，混淆黑白，煽惑人心，以便达到他们的最终目的：既然人民中国都是坏人坏事，你们不下台何待？！
    在郑州积极收集右派喽啰，死心蹋地执行章罗同盟大发展的任务
    张云川在北京完成了头一个进攻的战役后，又急急忙忙的跑到郑州，执行章罗同盟大发展的任务，为章罗收集破铜烂铁，作为争天下的资本。在郑州他宣传北京大学大鸣大放的情况，他宣称林希翎的意见大部分是对的。这不是想在郑州也把反对社会主义的火燃起来是什么？在他布置发展任务时交代说：“对向党汇报的假积极分子，你们不要发展。”发展什么人呢？很显然，他们要发展的也不过还是那些反人民的右派分子。张云川自己亲自寻找的对象大部分也就是这样一些人。他为什么专找这些人，把这些人组织起来又想干什么？请张云川告诉我们他们的目的。不过他此行成绩不大，因为他们把形势估计错了。张云川到郑州不久，人民就开始揭发右派集团的阴谋活动了。六月八日人民日报的社论发表了，右派头子看到形势不好，就一面收缩，一面抵抗。难怪这时张云川给李伯球、章伯钧写信埋怨说：“看到人民日报和光明日报上登载着农工民主党座谈会的消息，一看内容，不是对共产党提意见，帮助整风，却变成了对张云川提意见，成为农工党整风，甚感稀奇！你们要求我来郑州干事……在我不在座……也令人很觉那个。”可谓出乎张云川意料之外，但张云川并不肯就此而止，仍然继续散布恶毒的言论，对右派分子极表同情。农工民主党成员向他请示对北京反击章、罗右派分子的态度，他回答说鲜花毒草看是谁看。可以看出张云川反动的立场是如何的明确坚定，像章伯钧、葛佩琦这些反人民的“英雄”们，不是已经受到台湾、香港和美联社的欢呼了吗？张云川的发言也受到了台湾的欢迎。可是张云川还假惺惺地说章伯钧、葛佩琦的言论，没有市场，不必要追，而对卢郁文接到的恐吓信这件事，则断定“这不是真的”，换句话说，恐吓信是有意捏造的，是人民的阴谋了，这是何等的恶毒！谁能说张云川的爱憎不分明呢？
    在视察中常常造谣诬蔑，颠倒是非
    张云川这种反动的荒谬的言行，不是偶然的，他在江苏、安徽、河南、新疆等省区多次的视察中，常常是把农村干部说成大部分是坏的，甚至故意捏造什么灾区把树皮、树叶都吃光了，到了那个地方，人们问他树上的叶子是那来的，他说，我说的是过去；说这里饿死了人，那里也饿死了人，买粮也挤死了人，民有饥色，百分之八十的农民不满意党等等谎言，这就是说他们把造谣诬蔑、颠倒是非当作实现复辟的依据和策略。但你们这样作，你们真的能达到偷天换日目的么？你们的野心真的能够得逞吗？
    我认为这完全是梦想。共产党的领导，社会主义的道路，人民的天下是金城汤池，妄想动摇国本，是人民所决不允许的，劝告右派先生们要清醒一下，老老实实地向人民交代你们的罪恶的言行吧！
