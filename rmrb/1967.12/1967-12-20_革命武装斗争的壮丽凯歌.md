The magnificent victory song of revolutionary armed struggle resounds by the Mekong River, and triumphant news echoes from the foot of Longshan Mountain.

We, the Red Guards of Chairman Mao, joyfully celebrate and sing loudly for the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the organizer, leader, and inspirer of the victories of the people of South Vietnam!

Seven years have passed, seven years of heroic struggle and great victories for the people of South Vietnam, seven years of exposing the paper tiger of American imperialism, seven years of setting a brilliant example for the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world to achieve liberation!

Who can forget that seven years ago, when the people of South Vietnam did not yet have a powerful armed force, American imperialism and its lackeys were so brutal and arrogant! They ruthlessly suppressed and savagely "swept" through South Vietnam, launching a barbaric "undeclared war" of aggression. The once beautiful and prosperous South Vietnam became a hell on earth. Dark clouds hung over half of Vietnam. But clouds cannot obscure the sun. Where there is oppression, there is resistance! It was in these dark days that the flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam broke through the thick clouds and shone brilliantly. The heroic people of South Vietnam followed this flag, using revolutionary armed struggle against counter-revolutionary armed struggle, and launched the great struggle to resist America and save the nation. From then on, the struggle of the people of South Vietnam to liberate and unify their country entered a new stage. From the 17th parallel to Cape Camau, the people were armed, forming a vast sea of people's war. The American aggressors were like a wild cow charging into a fire, facing annihilation.

In the past seven years, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the armed forces of South Vietnam have grown from small to large, from weak to strong. Difficulties could not crush them, the "escalation" of the war could not intimidate them, and the "peace talks" deception could not fool them. The heroic people of South Vietnam, whether in close combat or night battles, on water or land, in dry or rainy seasons, fought against "sweeps," cut off transportation, launched ambushes, and attacked strongholds, making the enemy frustrated and unable to move.

Didn't American imperialism boast that its military power was "invincible"? Didn't modern revisionism spread war terror everywhere, preaching that American imperialism was untouchable and very frightening? But in the Vietnam War, American imperialism deployed nearly half of its ground troops, used nearly a fifth of its air force and a quarter of its navy, and employed all modern weapons except nuclear weapons, spending a staggering $300 billion annually. What did it gain? Only one defeat after another. Whether it was "sweeps," "strategic hamlets," "pacification" plans, "Staley-Taylor plans," "special warfare," "limited warfare," "helicopter transport tactics," or "armored vehicle transport tactics," all were defeated and scattered, meeting with utter failure. The military and people of South Vietnam annihilated a large number of enemies. In just the first eleven months of this year, they wiped out tens of thousands of American invaders, inflicting a very heavy defeat on the enemy.

Now, more than four-fifths of the land in South Vietnam and over ten million people have been liberated. But more than a million American invaders and their puppet troops and fake armies can only hide in a few major cities and key transportation lines, becoming sitting ducks. The heroic people of South Vietnam, creatively applying the strategies and tactics of people's war, enriched the experience of people's war and created a brilliant example of a single country resisting and defeating American imperialism after World War II.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his telegram congratulating the seventh anniversary of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, pointed out that the great victories of the people of South Vietnam once again show that "regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

Although the American aggressors, in their dying moments, still struggle desperately, and although the people of South Vietnam will inevitably face various difficulties before achieving final victory, the heroic people of South Vietnam are determined to fight on, to fight to the end, to persist in a protracted war, and will definitely drive the American aggressors out of South Vietnam.

Heroic Vietnamese brothers, we firmly support you. We, the Red Guards of Chairman Mao, with boiling blood, resolutely stand with all the people of China to fully support you in completely annihilating the American aggressors. We firmly believe that the great cause of the Vietnamese people to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country will definitely achieve final victory!

　　革命武装斗争的壮丽凯歌
　　北京航空学院  齐援
    湄公河畔凯歌高奏，长山脚下捷报纷飞。
    我们，毛主席的红卫兵，为越南南方人民胜利的组织者、领导者和鼓舞者——越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年而纵情欢呼，放声歌唱！
    七年，是越南南方人民英勇奋战、取得伟大胜利的七年，是把美帝国主义这只外强中干的纸老虎戳得狼狈不堪，支离破碎的七年，也是越南人民为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立光辉榜样的七年！
    人们怎么能忘记，七年前，当越南南方人民还没有一支强大的人民武装力量的时候，美帝国主义及其走狗何等横暴，何等嚣张！它们在南越疯狂地镇压，残暴地“扫荡”，发动了惨绝人寰的“不宣而战”的侵略战争。富饶美丽的越南南方，变成了血雨腥风的人间地狱。乌云，笼罩着越南的半边天。可是，乌云遮不住太阳。那里有压迫，那里就有反抗！就在这黑沉沉的日子，越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，冲破了重重乌云，放射出夺目的光采。英雄的越南南方人民跟随这面旗帜，用革命的武装反对反革命的武装，投入了抗美救国的伟大战斗。从此，越南南方人民争取解放和统一祖国的斗争，进入了一个崭新的阶段。从十七度线到金瓯角，广大人民武装起来，形成了一个人民战争的汪洋大海。美国侵略者犹如一只冲入火阵的野牛，面临着灭亡的命运。
    七年来，在越南南方民族解放阵线领导下，越南南方人民武装力量由小到大，由弱变强。困难压不垮他们，战争“升级”吓不倒他们，“和谈”骗局骗不了他们。英雄的越南南方人民，不管是近战还是夜战，水战还是陆战，也不管是旱季还是雨季，反“扫荡”，断交通，打伏击，攻据点，把敌人打得焦头烂额，寸步难行。
    美帝国主义不是吹嘘它的军事力量是“不可战胜”的吗？现代修正主义不是到处散布战争恐怖，宣扬美帝国主义碰不得，可怕得很吗？可是，在侵越战争中，美帝国主义投入了它的近二分之一的地面部队，动用了它近五分之一的空军和四分之一以上的海军，使用了核武器以外的一切现代化武器，耗费的军费达到一年三百亿美元的庞大数字。它赢得的却是什么呢？只是一个紧接一个的惨败。什么“扫荡”，什么“战略村”，什么“绥靖”计划、“斯特利—泰勒计划”，什么“特种战争”、“局部战争”，什么“直升飞机运输战术”、“战车运输战术”，通通都被打得落花流水，一败涂地。越南南方军民消灭了大量敌人。仅今年头十一个月就歼灭了美国侵略军十几万，使敌人遭到极其惨重的失败。
    现在，越南南方五分之四以上的土地和超过一千万人口已经获得解放。而一百多万美国侵略军和仆从军、伪军，却只能龟缩在少数大城市和一些主要交通线上，成为瓮中之鳖。英雄的越南南方人民，创造性地运用人民战争的战略战术，丰富了人民战争的经验，创造了第二次世界大战以后一个国家单独抗击和战胜美帝国主义的光辉典范。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的电报中指出，越南南方人民的伟大胜利又一次表明，“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    尽管美国侵略者在行将灭亡的时候还要进行垂死的挣扎，尽管南越人民在取得最后胜利之前必然还会遇到各式各样的困难，但是，英雄的南越人民决心打下去，打到底，坚持持久战争，就一定能够把美国侵略者从越南南方赶出去。
    英雄的越南兄弟，我们坚决支持你们。我们毛主席的红卫兵，热血沸腾，坚决同全中国人民一起，全力支援你们彻底消灭美国侵略者。我们坚信：越南人民解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的伟大事业一定取得最后胜利！
