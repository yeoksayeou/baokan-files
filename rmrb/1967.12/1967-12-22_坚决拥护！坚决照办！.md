	Resolutely Support! Resolutely Carry Out!
	Guard Troops at Tiananmen

	At the time when the people of South Vietnam are enthusiastically celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front, the great leader of the people of the world, the reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, sent a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho. This telegram, like a clap of spring thunder, has reverberated throughout the world. Chairman Mao's telegram has illuminated the path of struggle for liberation for the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, and it has declared the fate of the U.S. aggressors in the Vietnam War—to be utterly destroyed. Chairman Mao's telegram is not only the greatest support and encouragement for the fighting people of Vietnam, but also the greatest support and encouragement for the revolutionary peoples of the world. Chairman Mao's telegram speaks the words in the hearts of revolutionary soldiers and fully expresses the determination of the 700 million people of China to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. We resolutely support! We resolutely carry out!

	Over the past seven years, the heroic people of South Vietnam, under the strong leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have raised the great banner of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and have fought bravely against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, achieving brilliant victories and setting a shining example of armed revolutionary struggle against U.S. imperialism for the people of the world.

	South Vietnam has only 14 million people and 170,000 square kilometers of land. However, the heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam, with their fearless fighting spirit, have persisted in waging a people's war. They fight stronger and braver with each battle, defeating more than 100,000 U.S. and puppet troops, making them flee in disarray. The great victories of the heroic Vietnamese people have powerfully proven that what determines the outcome of a war is not one or two pieces of new weaponry, but a people who are not afraid of sacrifice, not afraid of hardship, dare to struggle, and dare to win.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "We firmly support you. Our two countries are neighboring countries that depend on each other. Our two peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. The brothers of South Vietnam and all the people of Vietnam can believe that your struggle is our struggle." We, the soldiers of the great People's Liberation Army of China armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will resolutely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, fully support the struggle of the Vietnamese people, and pledge to be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people until the Vietnamese people drive all U.S. aggressors out of their country and achieve a complete victory in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation!

    坚决拥护！坚决照办！
    守卫天安门警卫战士
    在越南南方人民热烈庆祝民族解放阵线成立七周年的时候，全世界人民的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，给阮友寿主席的贺电，象一声春雷震动了全世界。毛主席的贺电照亮了全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放斗争的道路，宣告了美国侵略者在侵越战争中彻底灭亡的命运。毛主席的贺电，不仅是对战斗的越南人民的最大支持、最大鼓舞，也是对全世界革命人民的最大支持、最大鼓舞。毛主席的贺电，说出了我们革命战士心里话，最充分地表达了七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的决心。我们坚决拥护！坚决照办！
    七年来，英雄的越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的坚强领导下，高举抗美救国的伟大旗帜，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行英勇奋战，取得了辉煌胜利，为全世界人民树立了反美武装革命斗争的光辉榜样。
    越南南方只有一千四百万人民，十七万平方公里的土地。但是，英雄的越南南方军民，以大无畏的战斗精神，坚持进行人民战争。他们越战越强，越战越勇，把一百多万美伪军打得落花流水，屁滚尿流。英雄越南人民的伟大胜利，雄辩地证明，决定战争胜负的不是一两件新式武器，而是不怕牺牲，不怕困难，敢于斗争，敢于胜利的人民。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“我们坚决支持你们。我们两国是唇齿相依的邻邦。我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。”我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的强大的中国人民解放军的战士，坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，全力支援越南人民的斗争，誓作越南人民坚强后盾，直到越南人民把美国侵略者全部赶出自己的国土，取得抗美救国战争的彻底胜利！
