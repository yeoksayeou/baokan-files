Soldier Xiao Guo loves Chairman Mao the most. After discussing with his fellow soldiers in the platoon, he wrote a heartfelt message under his beloved colored portrait of Chairman Mao:

	“Chairman Mao is by my side”

	Soldier Wang Dianrong, PLA Unit stationed in Yanji City

On a Saturday evening, the new soldier Xiao Guo framed his most cherished colored portrait of Chairman Mao in a beautifully crafted frame he made himself and hung it neatly above his bed. The radiance of the red sun illuminated Xiao Guo's face. Gazing at the great image of Chairman Mao, he felt he should write a heartfelt message under the portrait. What should he write? He called his fellow soldiers in the platoon to his bed and asked for their help in coming up with an idea.

The small room suddenly became lively. More than twenty pairs of eyes gazed at the reddest sun in our hearts. Everyone chimed in with their thoughts.

Someone said, "The East is red, the sun rises, Chairman Mao is the great savior of all the people of China and the world. I think we should write 'Long live Chairman Mao!'"

Someone else said, "Chairman Mao's face is radiant, full of vigor, waving and smiling at us. I think we should write 'Wishing our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!'"

Another said, "Chairman Mao is wearing a green military uniform with a red badge, the red emblem shining brightly. Chairman Mao is our great commander. It's better to write 'Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, long live! Ten thousand years!'"

Xiao Guo listened to everyone's suggestions while pondering. Many great historical events surged into his mind. From the rising red sun in Shaoshan to the call to arms of the Autumn Harvest Uprising; from the red flag on Jinggangshan to the lamp in the cave dwellings of Yan'an; from the storm of the great battles to the roaring flames of the Cultural Revolution... The future of the motherland, the world revolution, all these, are led by Chairman Mao from victory to victory. Shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" a thousand times, ten thousand times, still cannot express our boundless love and respect for him!

Xiao Guo also remembered his progress and growth over the past year in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought. He recalled that when he first enlisted, he was not dedicated to his work. It was Chairman Mao's brilliant works, the "Three Constantly Read Articles," that illuminated his heart and helped him understand the meaning of revolution. During the support-left work, once while on guard duty, he fell ill with a high fever, dizzy and weak, barely able to stand. Looking up, he saw the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the guard tower. Thinking that he was guarding for Chairman Mao and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, he found boundless strength, and his feet stood firmly. Chairman Mao! It is you who gave me political life, who gave me the strength to fight. At this critical moment of the Cultural Revolution, you issued the newest battle call to us, "To fight self and criticize revisionism." In the great storms of class struggle, we rely entirely on Mao Zedong Thought to navigate. We cannot take a single step without Chairman Mao, without Mao Zedong Thought.

Xiao Guo became more and more excited, and a sentence burst from his heart: "Chairman Mao! You are by my side!" Xiao Guo's words expressed the common voice of all the soldiers in the platoon. They said: Yes, Chairman Mao is always by our side. We must always follow our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, fight self and criticize revisionism for life, dedicate our lives to revolution, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao.

Thus, Xiao Guo respectfully wrote under Chairman Mao's portrait: "Chairman Mao is by my side."

    战士小郭最最热爱毛主席，他和排里的同志热烈议论一阵以后，在自己心爱的一张毛主席彩色画像下面，写上了一句心里话：
    “毛主席就在我身旁”
    解放军驻延吉市某部战士　王殿荣
    星期六晚上，新战士小郭把最心爱的毛主席彩色画像镶在亲手做的精致的像框里，端端正正地挂在床头上。红太阳的光辉映红了小郭的脸，他望着毛主席的伟大形象，觉得应该在毛主席像下面写上一句心里话。写什么好呢？他把排里的同志招呼到自己床前，让大家帮助出主意。
    小屋子一下热闹了。二十多双眼睛仰望着我们心中最红最红的红太阳，你一言，我一语地议论着。
    有的说，东方红，太阳升，毛主席是全中国全世界人民的大救星，我看应该写上“毛主席万岁！”
    有的说，毛主席红光满面，神采奕奕，向我们招手微笑，我看应该写上“敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！”
    有的说，毛主席身穿绿军装，佩戴红领章，红色的帽徽闪闪发光，毛主席是我们的伟大统帅，还是写“我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    小郭一边听着大家议论，一边琢磨，多少伟大历史事件涌上心头。从韶山的一轮红日升起到秋收起义的号角；从井冈山的红旗到延安窑洞的灯光；从大决战的风暴到无产阶级文化大革命的烈火熊熊，……祖国的前途，世界的革命，这一切一切，都是毛主席引导我们从胜利走向胜利。一千遍一万遍欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”也表达不尽我们对他老人家无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情啊！
    小郭又想起自己一年多来，在毛泽东思想大学校里的进步成长。记得刚入伍的时候，工作上不安心，是毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”照亮了自己的心坎，懂得了革命的道理。在支左工作中，一次站岗执勤，生病发烧，头昏眼花，身体有些支持不住。抬头看到了岗楼上挂着的毛主席像，想到是在为保卫毛主席，为捍卫毛主席革命路线而站岗，浑身就有了无穷的力量，脚跟就站得更牢了。毛主席啊，毛主席！是您给了我政治生命，是您给了我战斗的力量。在无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，您又向我们发出“要斗私，批修”的最新战斗号令。在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，全靠毛泽东思想给我们导航。我们一步也离不开毛主席，一步也离不开毛泽东思想。
    小郭越想越激动，情不自禁地从心里迸发出一句话：“毛主席啊！您就在我身旁！”小郭的这句话说出了全排指战员的共同心声。他们说：对，毛主席永远在我们身旁，我们就是要永远紧跟伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席，一辈子斗私批修，干一辈子革命，永远永远忠于毛主席。
    这样，小郭恭恭敬敬地在毛主席像下面写上了“毛主席就在我身旁”。
