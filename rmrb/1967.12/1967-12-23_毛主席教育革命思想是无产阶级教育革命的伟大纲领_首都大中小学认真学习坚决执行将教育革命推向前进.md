In the burgeoning proletarian educational revolution, the primary and secondary schools in the capital have launched an unprecedented mass movement to study and implement Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution. Broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff members enthusiastically declare: Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution are the great program for conducting the proletarian educational revolution, the most powerful weapon for criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and the fundamental guideline for resuming classes and making revolution. We must seriously study, deeply understand, closely follow, and strictly implement them, and advance the proletarian educational revolution victoriously under the guidance of Chairman Mao.

"Navigating the vast seas relies on the helmsman; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in the capital's primary and secondary schools unanimously express: Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution are an important component of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant and creative development of Marxism-Leninism. They have epoch-making significance for eliminating the bourgeois educational system and establishing a new proletarian educational system. In his series of extremely important instructions on educational revolution, Chairman Mao has given extremely profound and clear directives on the proletarian educational line, policies, system, and the reform of teaching content and methods. To achieve a thorough victory in the great proletarian educational revolution, the fundamental key is to seriously study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution.

Recently, the Beijing Revolutionary Committee held a standing committee meeting to discuss the issue of immediately launching a mass movement to study and implement Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution in all primary and secondary schools in the city. From the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, the Beijing Garrison Command, and the People's Liberation Army units executing military and political training tasks in primary and secondary schools, to the revolutionary committees (preparatory groups) of various districts and counties, the revolutionary committees of various schools, and the leading bodies for resuming classes and making revolution, leaders at all levels take the lead in seriously studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution. The revolutionary committees of Beijing Aviation Institute, Beijing Geological Institute, Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute, Beijing Forestry Institute, Beijing Normal University, China Medical University, and Beijing Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower, as well as many primary and secondary schools, have first seriously studied and discussed, or held school-wide mobilization meetings, repeatedly explaining to the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff the great significance of studying Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution. Broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff either participated in study classes on Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution or formed small groups to seriously study and repeatedly discuss, making Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution deeply ingrained in their hearts. In the study class specially organized for middle schools in the capital to study and implement Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, more than sixty revolutionary teachers and students from schools that have done well in educational revolution, and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army executing military and political training tasks in middle schools, participated in the study. They said that in carrying out the educational revolution, the most important thing is to study and implement Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution.

Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in the capital's primary and secondary schools emphasize combining study with practice in the process of studying Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution, and working hard on the implementation. They bring the problems in the educational revolution of their schools, departments, and classes, the problems in their own ideological revolution, and the problems in the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, and study and apply them actively, combining learning with use, learning what is urgently needed first, and seeing immediate results.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in the capital's primary and secondary schools arm themselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, organizing a vast army for the proletarian educational revolution. They closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasp the general direction of the current struggle in schools, and insist on resuming classes and making revolution. Some middle and primary schools at the forefront of the educational revolution, with the help of the People's Liberation Army executing military and political training tasks, emphasize proletarian politics, focus on the Four Firsts, promote the Three-Eighths style, and vigorously promote the ideological transformation of people. Broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students, with "Criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, launch a revolution in their souls, thoroughly criticize petty-bourgeois factionalism, and establish proletarian party spirit, rapidly achieving and continuously consolidating and developing revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, striving to be the vanguard and pioneers of the proletarian educational revolution. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in higher schools that have achieved revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, in the mass movement of thoroughly applying Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, have a clearer understanding of the general direction of the current struggle in schools, and insist on resuming classes and making revolution. Broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff deeply feel that the attitude towards the educational revolution is the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and is an important sign of whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao says: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. To destroy, one must reason, and reasoning is construction. With destruction as the key, construction is also within it." Since resuming classes and making revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries and broad masses in the capital's primary and secondary schools have used Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution as a powerful weapon to expose, criticize, and struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line led by China's Khrushchev and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating schools. Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute, Beijing Agricultural University, Yuegezhuang Middle School, Xiangfanglu Primary School, and Hongmiao Primary School have all deeply carried out the revolutionary criticism in the field of education in their teaching practices. Many students have also exposed and denounced the harm done to youth by the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational system and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" through their personal experiences. They use Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution to analyze and criticize, seeing more clearly the reactionary nature of the old educational system, and hating the revisionist educational system even more, while greatly enhancing their confidence and determination to establish a new proletarian educational system according to Mao Zedong Thought.

Now, in many primary and secondary schools in the capital, broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students take the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example, reforming from the educational system to teaching content and methods. Many schools, such as Shijingshan Middle School, Caochangdi Middle School, the 23rd Middle School, the 60th Middle School, the 104th Middle School, Changxindian Town Central Primary School, and many others, have achieved initial results in the educational revolution by actively applying Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, taking new steps. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, the 23rd Middle School in Beijing practices, reforms, summarizes, and improves, teaching and learning in criticism, deepening the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and achieving some results in teaching reform. The revolutionary teachers and students of Caochangdi Middle School seriously study Chairman Mao's instruction of "Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, soldiers teach soldiers," learn and apply it, implement democratic teaching, with teachers and students on the same platform, teaching and learning from each other, also achieving good results. Now, Chairman Mao's thought of "Officers teach soldiers, soldiers teach officers, soldiers teach soldiers" has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit in more and more revolutionary teachers and students. Some schools also invite workers, peasants, and soldiers to the platform to teach students about class struggle, achieving immediate results. In terms of the educational system, Beijing Forestry Institute has abolished dozens of research rooms and established seven professional platoons, gaining initial experience. Xieshuihu Primary School has also set up industrial and agricultural committees to explore the experience of students learning from workers and peasants. Beijing Agricultural University is actively working on a teaching reform plan, preparing to move the school to the countryside. Some schools have also self-reliantly set up factories within the school. Broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff confidently declare that they will definitely make our schools into red Mao Zedong Thought schools in this great proletarian educational revolution, cultivating reliable successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Students and teachers of the Forestry Machinery Specialty Platoon at Beijing Forestry Institute use real objects and charts to compare with textbooks for teaching.

    毛主席教育革命思想是无产阶级教育革命的伟大纲领  首都大中小学认真学习坚决执行将教育革命推向前进
    革命师生员工以毛主席教育革命思想为锐利武器，狠批修正主义教育路线，解决本校斗批改中的实际问题
    新华社二十一日讯　在蓬勃开展的无产阶级教育革命中，首都大中小学掀起了空前规模的学习和执行毛主席教育革命光辉思想的群众运动。广大革命师生员工满怀革命豪情地说，毛主席教育革命的光辉思想，是进行无产阶级教育革命的伟大纲领，是批判反革命修正主义教育路线的无比锐利的武器，是复课闹革命的根本指针，我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会，步步紧跟，句句照办，按照毛主席指引的方向，把无产阶级教育革命胜利地推向前进。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。首都大中小学的广大无产阶级革命派一致表示：毛主席的教育革命思想，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的重要组成部分，是对马克思列宁主义天才的、创造性的发展，对于破除资产阶级的旧教育制度，建立崭新的无产阶级教育制度，具有划时代的伟大意义。毛主席在关于教育革命一系列极其重要的教导中，对于无产阶级的教育路线、方针、制度，直到教学内容和方法的改革，都作了极其深刻和明确的指示。我们要取得伟大的无产阶级教育革命的彻底胜利，根本的根本，关键的关键，就是要认真学习和坚决执行毛主席教育革命的光辉思想。
    北京市革命委员会最近召开常委会，讨论了在全市大中小学立即掀起声势浩大的学习和执行毛主席教育革命思想的群众运动高潮的问题。从市革命委员会、北京卫戍区军政训练指挥部和在大中小学执行军政训练任务的中国人民解放军各部队，到各区县的革命委员会（筹备小组）、各个学校的革命委员会和复课闹革命领导班子，各级领导人带头认真学习和坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于教育革命的指示。北京航空学院、北京地质学院、北京邮电学院、北京林学院、北京师范大学、中国医科大学和北京水利水电学院等高等学校和许多中小学的革命委员会的委员们，都首先认真学习讨论，或召开全校传达动员大会，反复向广大革命师生员工宣讲学习毛主席教育革命思想的伟大意义。广大革命师生员工有的参加了毛主席教育革命思想学习班，有的编成小组认真学习，反复讨论，使毛主席教育革命的光辉思想深入人心。在首都中学专门开办的学习和贯彻执行毛主席教育革命思想的学习班里，一批教育革命搞得较好的学校的革命师生和在中学执行军政训练任务的人民解放军六十多人参加了学习。他们说，在开展教育革命中，千重要，万重要，学习和执行毛主席教育革命思想最重要。
    首都大中小学革命师生员工在学习毛主席教育革命光辉思想的过程中，都特别强调结合斗争实践活学活用，在用字上狠下功夫。他们带着本校、本系、本班教育革命中的问题，带着自己思想革命中的问题，带着革命大批判和本单位斗批改中的问题，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影。
    毛主席教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”首都大中小学广大无产阶级革命派和革命师生员工用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，组织起了浩浩荡荡的无产阶级教育革命大军。他们紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握学校当前斗争的大方向，坚持复课闹革命。走在教育革命前列的一些中小学校，在执行军政训练任务的人民解放军的帮助下，突出无产阶级政治，大抓四个第一，大兴三八作风，大力促进人的思想革命化。广大革命师生以“斗私，批修”为纲，在灵魂深处爆发革命，大破小资产阶级派性，大立无产阶级党性，迅速实现并且不断巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，争当无产阶级教育革命的先锋和闯将。实现了革命大联合和革命三结合的高等学校的广大革命师生员工，在大学大用毛主席教育革命思想的群众运动中，更加认清了学校当前斗争的大方向，坚持复课闹革命。广大革命师生员工深深体会到，对待教育革命的态度，就是对待毛主席和毛泽东思想的态度，就是鉴别是否忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。
    毛主席说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”复课闹革命以来，首都大中小学的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，用毛主席教育革命思想这个无比锐利的武器，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义教育路线和资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，进行了大揭发，大批判，大斗争。北京邮电学院、北京农业大学、岳各庄中学、香厂路小学、红庙一小等大中小学校，都在教学实践中深入开展了教育领域的革命大批判。许多学生还以亲身经历，揭发控诉了反革命修正主义教育制度和资产阶级反动学术“权威”对青年的毒害。他们用毛主席教育革命思想去分析批判，更加看清了旧教育制度的反动本质，更加激起对修正主义教育制度的无比憎恨，同时也大大提高了按照毛泽东思想建立崭新的无产阶级教育制度的信心和决心。
    现在，首都许多大中小学的广大革命师生，都以抗大为榜样，从教育体制到教学内容、教学方法等方面，边实践，边改革。北京市石景山中学、草场地中学、二十三中学、六十中学、一○四中学、长辛店镇中心小学等许多学校的无产阶级革命派和泄水湖小学革命委员会的同志，活学活用毛主席的教育革命思想，在教育革命中取得了初步的成效，迈出了新的一步。北京二十三中学在毛主席教育革命思想指引下，边实践，边改革，边总结，边提高，在批判中教，在批判中学，对反革命修正主义教育路线的大批判越来越深入，教学改革取得了不少成绩。草场地中学的革命师生，认真学习毛主席的“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的指示，学了就用，实行教学民主，师生同上讲台，互教互学，也收到很好的效果。现在，毛主席的“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的思想，已在越来越多的革命师生中生根、开花、结果。不少学校还邀请工农兵登上讲台，给学生上阶级斗争课，收到了立竿见影的效果。在教育体制上，北京林学院将几十个教研室取消，建立起七个专业连队，取得了初步的经验。泄水湖小学还设立了工业和农业委员，探索学生学工学农的经验。北京农业大学正在积极搞教改方案，准备把学校搬到农村去办。有的学校还自力更生在校内办起了工厂。广大革命师生员工信心百倍地表示，一定要在这场伟大的无产阶级教育革命中，把我们的学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校，为无产阶级革命事业培养可靠的接班人。（附图片）
