The Albanian "Unity" Newspaper strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' use of the United Nations to play the "peace talks" trick on the Vietnam issue
Absolutely not allow the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnamese people's just struggle

New China News Agency, Tirana, December 11 - The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on the Vietnam issue on December 10, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' use of the United Nations to play the "peace talks" trick. The commentary pointed out that the only way to resolve the Vietnam issue is for the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops to withdraw from Vietnam.

The commentary said that in the past week, despite suffering one humiliating defeat after another in Vietnam, the Washington government is still not giving up and is attempting to further expand its aggression in Southeast Asia. Recently, the U.S. government has been using its propaganda machine to spread the so-called "peaceful" resolution of the Vietnam issue through the United Nations. Its purpose is, on the one hand, to spread the illusion that the Vietnam issue can be resolved "peacefully" through the United Nations, in an attempt to quell the increasingly high tide of opposition to the U.S. aggression in Vietnam among the American people; on the other hand, to lull the people of Southeast Asia into a false sense of security, making them lose vigilance against the frantic war preparations being made by the U.S. imperialists to expand their aggression in this region. Officials in Washington are now openly admitting that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is also involved in this conspiracy.

The commentary pointed out that the only way to resolve the Vietnam issue is for the U.S. aggressor troops to withdraw from Vietnam forever.

The commentary pointed out that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have repeatedly stated that the United Nations and the Security Council have nothing to do with the Vietnam issue, because the United Nations and the Security Council are tools of U.S. imperialism. The Vietnamese people will never allow it to interfere in their just war. The Vietnamese people will, as before, never stop their struggle until the aggressors are driven out of their land.

　　阿《团结报》强烈谴责美帝利用联合国在越南问题上玩弄“和谈”骗局
    决不允许联合国干涉越南人民的正义斗争
    新华社地拉那十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十日就越南问题发表评论，强烈谴责美帝国主义利用联合国在越南问题上玩弄“和谈”骗局。评论指出，解决越南问题的唯一途径是美帝国主义侵略军撤出越南。
    评论说，最近一周来，华盛顿政府尽管在越南接二连三地遭到可耻的失败，但仍然贼心不死，企图进一步扩大在东南亚的侵略战争。最近，美国政府开动宣传机器，大肆宣扬所谓美国正在努力通过联合国以求“和平”解决越南问题。其目的，一方面是为了散布所谓通过联合国有可能以“和平的方式”解决越南问题的幻想，妄图平息美国人民反对美国侵越战争的越来越高涨的浪潮；另一方面为了麻痹东南亚人民的反帝斗志，使他们对美帝国主义者为了扩大这一地区的侵略战争而疯狂地进行的备战活动失去警惕。华盛顿的官员现在毫不掩饰苏联修正主义领导集团也参与了这个阴谋。
    评论指出，解决越南问题的唯一办法是美国侵略军永远撤出越南。
    评论指出，越南南方民族解放阵线和越南民主共和国政府多次重申，联合国和安全理事会同越南问题毫无关系，因为联合国和安全理事会是美帝国主义手中的工具，越南人民永远也不会允许它干涉越南人民的正义战争，越南人民将一如既往，一刻也不停止斗争，直到侵略者滚出自己的土地。
