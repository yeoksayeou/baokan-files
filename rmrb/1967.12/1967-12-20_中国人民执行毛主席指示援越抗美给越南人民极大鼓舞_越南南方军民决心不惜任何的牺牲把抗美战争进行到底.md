	Comrade Nguyen Thuan Long, the head of the delegation, spoke at the celebration of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in the capital.

	The aid provided by the Chinese people, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, to Vietnam in its resistance against America has greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people. The military and civilians of South Vietnam are determined to sacrifice everything to carry the war of resistance against America to the end.

	The U.S. imperialists are attempting to use the United Nations Security Council to intervene in the Vietnam War and are spreading talk of "peace negotiations" to cover up their plot to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam. They cannot deceive anyone.

	Your victories once again demonstrate that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated. The war of resistance against American aggression led by the great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh is a shining example for all oppressed peoples and nations in their struggle for liberation.

	Mao Zedong

	Respected Premier Zhou Enlai,
	Dear Friends:

	When we, the delegation of the people of South Vietnam, set foot on the vast rear area of the Vietnamese people—the great territory of the People's Republic of China—and gathered with our comrades-in-arms, the heroic Chinese people, who are willing to make any sacrifice to wholeheartedly support us, we felt extremely excited and honored. First of all, let us convey the warmest fighting solidarity greetings from the 14 million people of South Vietnam standing on the front lines of resistance against America to all the guests and friends present, to the people of Beijing, and to all the brotherly Chinese people.

	Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese Party, the Chinese government, and the brotherly Chinese people have provided tremendous, sincere, and effective aid to the struggle of the people of South Vietnam to resist American aggression and save the nation. Here, we, the people of South Vietnam and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, express our deep gratitude. We sincerely thank the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and various Chinese people's organizations for holding this grand meeting to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	Guests and Friends:

	Seven years ago, on December 20, 1960, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam was established. The founding of the Front was the inevitable result of the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against American aggression and its puppets. This major historical event marked a great turning point in the liberation struggle of the people of South Vietnam.

	Over the past seven years, the people of South Vietnam have written a glorious chapter of victory with their blood and flesh, achieving great feats in the cause of liberation.

	Under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with a strong patriotic spirit and deep hatred for the enemy, the people of South Vietnam have creatively combined armed struggle with political struggle, launching continuous attacks on the enemy in military, political, and enemy work, and foiling the enemy's military and political plans, achieving a series of major victories of strategic significance. In the vast rural areas, the movement to destroy "strategic hamlets" has adopted the form of local guerrilla warfare and partial uprisings, shattering the dictatorship of Ngo Dinh Diem and foiling his plan to advance north. The U.S. imperialists had to resort to desperate measures, sending troops to South Vietnam to wage a "special war," which was essentially a new type of colonialist war of aggression. The people of South Vietnam rose up to wage a war of resistance and national salvation, shattering the U.S. imperialists' military plans, almost completely eliminating "strategic hamlets," liberating four-fifths of the land and 10 million people. The U.S. imperialists' "special war" strategy suffered a complete failure, and they had to urgently send hundreds of thousands of U.S. expeditionary forces and allied troops, along with modern warfare equipment, to South Vietnam, shifting from "special war" to limited war, intensifying the war of aggression in South Vietnam, and strengthening the war of destruction against North Vietnam with air power. However, they suffered even greater failures. The U.S. imperialists' first strategic offensive in the 1965-1966 dry season, using more than 200,000 U.S. and allied troops and 600,000 puppet troops, suffered a heavy defeat, with more than 110,000 U.S. and puppet troops losing their combat effectiveness, and 30 regiments being annihilated. To achieve the so-called "second strategic offensive," the stubborn U.S. imperialists increased the number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam to 400,000. The military and civilians of South Vietnam once again foiled the U.S. plot, shattering the so-called "pincer offensive" plan, annihilating 198,000 enemy troops, including 92,000 U.S. troops and 15,000 allied troops, achieving a great and comprehensive victory. By the summer and autumn of 1967, the military and civilians of South Vietnam achieved another great victory, annihilating 143,000 enemy troops, including 63,000 U.S. troops and 5,500 allied troops, annihilating 22 enemy regiments or equivalent units, 145 companies, shooting down and destroying more than 1,400 enemy aircraft, annihilating 3,100 military vehicles, and 107 military ships, attacking 50 enemy provincial capitals, towns, districts, military divisions, and military sub-divisions, and destroying 180 enemy fortifications.

	These achievements mark the leap in the fighting capabilities of the military and civilians of South Vietnam and indicate that we have made great progress in seizing the initiative on various battlefields and launching continuous offensives; the three types of armed forces are rapidly growing; we have reached an unprecedented level in flexibly, creatively, comprehensively, and effectively applying the line of people's war. The main forces, local forces, and guerrillas have cooperated well, universally and accurately striking the enemy, annihilating and wearing down a large number of the enemy's important military forces. The main forces have taken the initiative to launch fierce offensives, achieving brilliant feats. The local forces and guerrillas have continuously launched attacks on the enemy, sometimes from the front, sometimes from the rear, sometimes attacking enemy bases, sometimes attacking enemy supply lines, annihilating the enemy's "pacification" forces, and effectively supporting the people's movement to resist control and destroy "strategic hamlets." The military and civilians of South Vietnam can now annihilate batches of enemy strongholds in a single night, annihilate many entire enemy companies and regiments in battle, render entire enemy brigades and divisions combat-ineffective in a single operation, penetrate dozens of large and medium-sized cities and towns, and control these towns for several hours, and on water and land transportation lines, lure the enemy out to fight, almost completely cutting off the enemy's important transportation arteries.

	In the past two months, in response to the call of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on October 22, 1967, for a decisive winter-spring offensive, the military and civilians of South Vietnam have launched thunderous strikes on the enemy in Loc Ninh, My Tho, Ben Cat, Phuoc Long, Tay Ninh, Sa Dec, Di An, An Khe, Quang Nam, and Dac Lac, annihilating tens of thousands of enemy troops, shooting down and destroying many aircraft and armored vehicles, striking the enemy with such ferocity that they are in a state of panic. Statistics show that from October 22 to November 22, 1967, the military and civilians of South Vietnam annihilated more than 20 enemy regiments and dozens of companies, and rendered the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade combat-ineffective.

	The military and civilians of South Vietnam, who are in the position of launching a people's war, have, with great determination, concentrated their forces to decisively defeat the enemy's various dry-season offensive plans and rainy-season defensive plans, defeating the U.S. various tactics—from air mobility tactics to tank tactics, armored vehicle tactics, including B-52 strategic bomber tactics, flying boat tactics, and water base tactics, etc.—causing the enemy to suffer one failure after another in the military field.

	While launching military offensives, the people of South Vietnam are vigorously waging political struggles. In various large, medium-sized cities, and towns, especially in Saigon, Da Nang, and Hue, people from all walks of life have risen up to fight for the rights of national, livelihood, democracy, and freedom of belief. Recently, the struggles of workers, students, university students, the cultural and artistic circles, and the Buddhist community have grown stronger and developed further. In the rural areas and around enemy strongholds, the people have been continuously waging struggles against enemy sweeps and persecutions, destroying batches of enemy "strategic hamlets" and "refugee areas," killing evil-doers, resisting control, and firmly grasping and developing the right to be masters of their own homes. The vast liberated areas, which account for four-fifths of the total land area of South Vietnam, have been consolidated and developed. The various levels of the National Liberation Front have truly exercised the functions of various administrative organs, ensuring the improvement of living standards to enhance the people's fighting capabilities. More than 2 million hectares of land have been distributed to farmers. Agricultural production has been continuously developed. Cultural, educational, and health work in various fields has been given full attention and has achieved significant results. The people in the liberated areas have truly become masters of their own destiny. The people not only firmly grasp the right to be masters of their own homes in the liberated areas but also in many districts and villages temporarily controlled by the enemy in the guerrilla areas, this right has already been realized. The Extraordinary Congress of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, held at the end of August 1967, adopted the political program of the Front, which is a very important victory recently achieved in the political field. This political program is a banner of great national unity, uniting all patriotic forces determined to defeat the American aggressors and build an independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous South Vietnam. This political program reflects the will and determination of all the military and civilians of South Vietnam, reflects the fundamental aspirations and urgent demands of all the people to resist America, and is in line with the requirements and aspirations of the people and nations of the world who are fighting for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress.

	The international prestige of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is increasingly high. The people of the world, including the American people, are increasingly strongly sympathizing with and supporting the people of South Vietnam in their just and honorable war against the international police and the number one enemy of the people of the world, the U.S. imperialist aggressors. The National Liberation Front has established representative offices in many socialist and nationalist countries. The National Liberation Front and its various affiliated organizations have participated in all international and regional democratic and progressive organizations. The broad international public opinion and the governments of many countries recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the true and sole representative of the people of South Vietnam, supporting the political program of the National Liberation Front.

	In the past seven years, the victories achieved by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are the victories of the correct political and military lines of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the victories of the people's war line that has developed to a high degree in South Vietnam, the victories of the unyielding will of all the people of North and South Vietnam to defeat the American aggressors, and the victories of the lofty internationalist solidarity and friendship of the 700 million Chinese people and brothers and friends from the five continents who support and encourage the patriotic and just struggle of the people of South Vietnam. These victories indicate that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has completed and is completing its historical mission, achieving one victory after another in the South Vietnamese revolution. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the decisive factor in the development of the situation in South Vietnam. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam actually exercises the functions of a powerful and truly democratic state of the people of South Vietnam, and its international influence and prestige are increasingly great, truly deserving to be the true and sole representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam.

	The military and civilians of North Vietnam and South Vietnam have united in heart and mind, bravely shattering all the U.S. imperialists' war "escalations," shooting down more than 2,600 enemy aircraft, sinking and destroying more than 100 warships and patrol boats, while continuously strengthening the socialist construction of the North, enhancing the economic and defense capabilities to defend the North and support the South, fulfilling the duty of the rear to the front.

	At this joyous moment of celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam warmly congratulate the great victories achieved by our flesh-and-blood northern compatriots and take pride in them, regarding them as a great encouragement to ourselves.

	Guests and Friends! After suffering continuous defeats over the years, the U.S. imperialists suffered heavy defeats in the two dry-season strategic offensives, and their failures in the summer and autumn of this year were even more prominent. The position of the U.S. bandits and their puppets being passively beaten is clearer than ever. In military, political, strategic, and tactical terms, they are in a serious predicament. The days of the puppet army and puppet government are even worse. The domestic politics of the U.S. imperialists have never been in such a serious crisis as they are today, and the U.S. imperialists have never been so isolated in the world as they are today. The situation of the U.S. imperialists has never been as dark as it is today.

	In the face of the heavy and shameful defeat of 1.2 million troops, the U.S. imperialists are desperately trying to reverse the situation. They are increasing troops, rushing in weapons, including various most barbaric weapons, and are preparing to launch new military adventures in South Vietnam, intensifying the war of destruction against North Vietnam, attempting to escalate the war of aggression to the highest level. While waging an extremely brutal war in South Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists are also launching repeated military attacks on Cambodia, violating Cambodian territory, and constantly slandering and threatening Cambodia, attempting to cover up their criminal activities. Recently, the U.S. imperialists' puppets have been loudly clamoring, threatening the Royal Government of Cambodia that they have the "right" to pursue the enemy across the Cambodian border, preparing public opinion for the U.S. imperialists to invade Cambodia. They are constantly intensifying the war in Laos, while also creating an extremely dangerous situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

	While desperately intensifying the war of aggression in Vietnam, attempting to spread the war of fire throughout Indochina, the U.S. imperialists are also attempting to bring the Vietnamese issue to the United Nations, driving the United Nations Security Council to intervene in the Vietnam War, forcing us to accept their conditions. They are spreading deceptive peace negotiation talks to cover up their plot to intensify and expand the war of aggression in Vietnam, to cover up their failures on the Vietnamese battlefield, and to deceive world public opinion. But all the cunning deceptive talks of the U.S. imperialists can no longer deceive anyone. Today, they are using extremely brutal military means to intensify and expand the war of aggression, but this can in no way help them get out of the increasingly deep quagmire of failure. The more U.S. troops enter South Vietnam, the more they are surrounded by the flames of people's war, the more they expand the war, the more they expose their fundamental weaknesses in politics and the military, and the more they are trapped in a "dead-end alley with no way out." The U.S. imperialists have invaded South Vietnam, and the military and civilians of South Vietnam are determined to use all their strength to annihilate the American aggressors, no matter how great the sacrifice, no matter how arduous, no matter how long the war lasts, whether it is five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, the military and civilians of South Vietnam are determined to fight to the final victory. This is the unshakable will and determination of steel of the military and civilians of South Vietnam.

	Guests and Friends:

	The just struggle of the people of South Vietnam has received increasingly strong sympathy and support from the people and governments of various socialist countries, nationalist countries, national liberation movements, and all the people of the world who love peace, freedom, and justice, including progressive Americans.

	On this occasion, we express our heartfelt thanks to the people and governments of various countries, various international mass organizations, and individuals who have enthusiastically supported the just patriotic struggle of the Vietnamese people.

	At present, the struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist American aggression and save the nation is an inseparable part of the common struggle of all the people of the world to oppose old and new colonialism, to oppose imperialism led by the United States, and to struggle for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress.

	The military and civilians of South Vietnam are clearly aware of this glorious international duty and are determined to spare no effort, make any sacrifice, and fight to the end, to defeat the war of aggression launched by the U.S. imperialists in South Vietnam, and to make positive and practical contributions to the extremely great revolutionary cause of all nations in the world.

	Guests and Friends:

	China and Vietnam are neighboring countries that depend on each other. The people of South Vietnam have always deeply admired and closely followed the glorious achievements of the Chinese people. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people have carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution, building China into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and technology. China's successful test of the first hydrogen bomb marks the great progress of the Chinese people. The people of South Vietnam are extremely happy about the great victories of the Chinese people and regard these victories as their own. We firmly believe that in the cause of revolution and national construction, the Chinese people will achieve even greater victories.

	The struggle of the people of South Vietnam to resist American aggression has received the decisive, sincere, great, and effective sympathy and support of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the brotherly Chinese people. The Chinese people have carried out Chairman Mao's instructions that "the Chinese people are firmly supporting the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam," treating their own country as the vast rear area of the Vietnamese people, and wholeheartedly supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people to resist American aggression and save the nation. The "Support Vietnam, Resist America" campaign has been vigorously and extensively developed in the great territory of China.

	The people of South Vietnam highly evaluate the wholehearted support of the Chinese people and regard it as a great encouragement and significant contribution to the sacred cause of national salvation of the Vietnamese people.

	On this occasion, our delegation once again, on behalf of the 14 million people of South Vietnam, expresses our heartfelt and deepest thanks to the beloved Chairman Mao, the great Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the brotherly Chinese people.

	Guests and Friends:

	The past seven years have been seven years of extremely heroic and arduous struggle for the 14 million people of South Vietnam, and seven years of glorious victories. These victories have opened up a very favorable new development for the people of South Vietnam.

	The military and civilians of South Vietnam, who are enthusiastically celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, are in high spirits and full of fighting spirit, and with a grateful heart towards our international friends who sympathize with and support us, are determined to advance together with the 17 million flesh-and-blood northern compatriots, with the momentum of a raging fire and the force of a mountain collapse, to continue to fight more fiercely, more accurately, and more fiercely against the American aggressors and their puppets, to thoroughly implement the goals stated in the political program of the National Liberation Front, and to thoroughly fulfill our sacred duty to our beloved Vietnamese homeland: to liberate the South, defend the North, and achieve the peaceful reunification of the homeland.

	The Vietnamese people will surely win! The U.S. imperialists will surely fail!

	The political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam will surely be realized!

	Long live the indestructible fighting solidarity and friendship between the people of South Vietnam and the people of China!

	Long live the fighting solidarity and friendship of all the revolutionary people of the world who are struggling for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress!

　　尊敬的周恩来总理，
　　亲爱的朋友们：
    当我们越南南方人民代表团踏上越南人民广大辽阔的后方——伟大的中华人民共和国国土，同不惜作出任何牺牲全心全意支援我们的战友——英雄的中国人民欢聚一堂的时候，我们感到十分兴奋和荣幸。首先，让我们向在座的各位来宾、各位朋友，向首都北京的人民和全体兄弟的中国人民转达站在抗美前线的一千四百万越南南方人民最亲切的战斗团结的敬礼。以敬爱的毛泽东主席为首的中国党、中国政府和兄弟的中国人民给予越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争以巨大的、真诚的和有效的援助，在这里，我们越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会表示深切的感谢。我们衷心地感谢北京市革命委员会和中国各人民团体为越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年举办了这个隆重的大会。
    各位来宾，各位朋友：
    七年以前，一九六○年十二月二十日，越南南方民族解放阵线宣告成立。阵线的成立，是越南南方人民反抗美国侵略者及其卖国走狗无比英勇斗争的必然结果。这一重大的历史事件是越南南方人民解放斗争的伟大的转折点。
    七年来，越南南方人民用自己的血肉，为民族写下了可歌可泣的胜利史篇，在解放革命事业中立下了丰功伟绩。
    越南南方人民，在越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，以强烈的爱国精神和对敌的刻骨仇恨，创造性地把武装斗争和政治斗争结合起来，在军事、政治、敌军工作三个方面连续地向敌人发起进攻，并且挫败了敌人的军事、政治计划，接连地取得了具有战略意义的重大胜利。在农村的广大地区，捣毁“战略村”的运动，采取局部游击战争和分片起义的形式，粉碎了吴庭艳的独裁统治，使它的北进阴谋遭到了失败。美帝国主义不得不铤而走险，把军队派到越南南方，进行“特种战争”，而实质上就是一场新型的殖民主义侵略战争。越南南方人民一齐起来，进行救国抗战，接连地粉碎了美帝国主义的军事计划，几乎全部扫清了“战略村”，解放了五分之四的土地和一千万人民。美国侵略者的“特种战争”战略遭到彻底破产，不得不把数以十万计的美国远征军和仆从国家军队以及现代化的战争工具紧急运进越南南方，从“特种战争”转入局部战争，强化对南越的侵略战争，加强用空军对越南北方进行破坏性战争。但是，美国遭到了更加巨大的失败。美帝国主义一九六五年——一九六六年的第一次旱季战略攻势，使用了二十多万美军、仆从军以及六十万伪军，遭到惨重失败，十一万多美伪军丧失了战斗力，三十个营被歼灭。为实现所谓“第二次战略攻势”，顽固的美帝国主义把在南越的美军增加到四十万。越南南方军民再一次挫败了美国的阴谋，粉碎了所谓“钳形攻势”计划，消灭敌军十九万八千人，其中美军九万二千多人，仆从军一万五千人，取得了巨大和全面的胜利。到一九六七年夏秋，越南南方军民又取得了巨大胜利，消灭敌军十四万三千人，其中美军六万三千人，仆从军五千五百多人，消灭敌军二十二个营或相当营的单位，一百四十五个连，击落击毁敌机一千四百多架，消灭军用车辆三千一百辆，军用船只一百零七艘，袭击敌人省会、市镇、县郡、军分区、军支区等五十处，铲平敌碉堡一百八十个。
    这些成绩标志着越南南方军民在战斗中的飞跃成长，并且表明：我们在各战场掌握主动权和连续发动攻势方面有了巨大的进步；三种武装力量都在迅速壮大；我们在灵活地、创造性地、全面地、有效地运用人民战争路线方面已经达到了空前未有的水平。主力部队、地方部队和游击队互相配合得很好，普遍地、准确地打击了敌人，消灭和消耗敌人大量的重要军事力量。主力部队主动发动了猛烈的攻势，立下了辉煌的战功。地方部队和游击队连续对敌发动攻击，有时从正面，有时从背后，有时袭击敌军基地，有时袭击敌人的交通线，消灭敌人的“绥靖”部队，很好地支援了群众反控制、捣毁“战略村”的运动。越南南方军民已经可以在同一个夜晚消灭成批的敌人据点，在战斗中全歼敌军许多个整连、整营，在同一次行动中，使成团、成旅的敌军失去战斗力，深入数十个大中城市、城镇，并控制这些城镇达数小时之久，在水陆交通线上，把敌人引出来打，几乎全部切断了敌人的重要交通命脉。
    近两个月来，越南南方军民响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团一九六七年十月二十二日关于冬春决胜的号召，在禄宁、美萩、边和北面、槟椥、土龙木北面、沙沥、迪石、安和、广南、德都等地，给予敌人霹雳般的打击，消灭了数以万计的敌人，击落击毁许多飞机和装甲车，打得敌人丧魂落魄。据统计，从一九六七年十月二十二日到十一月二十二日，越南南方军民就消灭敌人二十多个营和几十个连，并使美国的一七三伞兵旅丧失了战斗力。
    处于人民战争的进攻和反攻地位的南方军民，以巨大的决心，集中力量坚决打败了敌人的各种旱季进攻计划和雨季防御计划，打败了美国的各种战术——从空中机动战术，到坦克战术、装甲车战术、包括Ｂ52战略轰炸机的轰炸机战术、飞船战术、水上基地战术等等，使敌人在军事上遭到一个比一个更大的失败。
    在发动军事进攻的同时，越南南方人民正大力开展政治斗争，各大、中城市、城镇，特别是西贡市、岘港、顺化市的各阶层人民，已纷纷起来为争取民族、民生、民主和自由信仰的权利而斗争。最近，工人、学生、大学生、文艺界、佛教界等的斗争日益壮大，并有新的发展。在农村和敌军据点周围地区，人民连续不断地进行反扫荡、反迫害的斗争，捣毁了敌人成批的“战略村”和“避难区”，杀恶棍，反控制，牢牢掌握并发展当家作主的权利。
    占越南南方全部土地面积五分之四的广大解放区得到了巩固和发展。民族解放阵线各级委员会真正地行使着各行政机关的职能，保证提高生活水平，以增强人民的战斗力。两百多万公顷田地已经分给农民。农业生产不断发展。文化、教育、卫生等各方面的工作受到充分的重视，取得了重大成就。解放区人民真正成了自己命运的主人。人民不但在解放区牢牢地掌握了当家作主的权利，而且在游击区暂时被敌人控制的许多区、村这一权利也已经体现了出来。越南南方民族解放阵线非常会议在一九六七年八月底通过了阵线的政治纲领，这是最近在政治方面取得的一个极其重要的胜利。这一政治纲领，是全民大团结的旗帜，它把决心战胜美国侵略者和建设独立、民主、和平、中立、繁荣的越南南方的各种爱国力量集合起来了。这一政治纲领反映了越南南方全体军民的意志和决心，反映了全体人民抗美的根本愿望和迫切要求，符合正在为民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步而斗争的世界人民和各民族的要求和愿望。
    越南南方民族解放阵线在国际上的威信越来越高。世界人民，包括美国人民在内，越来越强有力地同情和支持越南南方人民反对国际宪兵、全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义侵略者的光荣正义的战争。民族解放阵线在许多社会主义国家和民族主义国家设立了代表机构。民族解放阵线以及它所属的各个组织，参加了国际的和地区性的所有的民主和进步团体。广泛的国际舆论和许多国家的政府承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民真正的唯一的代表，支持民族解放阵线的政治纲领。
      在过去七年中越南南方民族解放阵线所取得的胜利是越南南方民族解放阵线正确的政治路线和军事路线的胜利，是在越南南方获得高度发展的人民战争路线的胜利，是越南南北方全体人民战胜美国侵略者坚强意志的胜利，是支持、鼓舞越南南方人民爱国正义斗争的七亿中国人民和遍于五大洲的兄弟朋友们崇高的国际主义团结友谊的胜利。这些胜利表明，越南南方民族解放阵线已经和正在完成自己的历史使命，使南方的革命取得了一个又一个的胜利。越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方形势发展的决定因素。越南南方民族解放阵线实际上行使着越南南方人民强大的真正民主的国家的职能，在国际上的影响越来越大，威信越来越高，真正不愧为一千四百万越南南方人民的唯一的真正的代表。
    越南北方军民和越南南方军民同心协力，英勇地粉碎了美帝国主义的一切战争“升级”，击落敌机两千六百余架，击沉和击毁上百艘军舰、别动艇，同时还不断加紧进行北方的社会主义建设事业，以加强保卫北方、支援南方的经济和国防力量，履行大后方对大前线的义务。
    当此兴高采烈地庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的时候，越南南方人民热烈祝贺我们骨肉的北方人民所取得的巨大胜利，并以此引为自豪，把它看成是对自己无比巨大的鼓舞。
    各位来宾，各位朋友！美帝国主义在多年来连续遭到失败之后，在两次旱季战略攻势中，又遭到惨重的失败，今年夏秋季的失败更为突出。美国强盗及其走狗被动挨打的地位，比任何时候都看得更加清楚了。不论在军事上、政治上、战略上、战术上它都陷入了严重的困境。伪军、伪政权的日子更不好过。美帝国主义的内政从来没有象今天这样遭到严重的危机，美帝国主义也从来没有象今天这样在全世界遭到孤立。美帝国主义的处境也从来没有象今天这样一片黑暗。
    在一百二十万军队遭到沉重和可耻失败的情况下，美帝国主义正在千方百计地企图挽救败局。它们正在加紧增兵，大力运进武器，其中包括各种最野蛮的杀人武器，并且加紧准备在越南南方进行新的军事冒险，加紧进行对越南北方的破坏性战争，企图把侵略战争升到最高级。美帝国主义一方面在越南南方进行无比残暴的战争，同时对柬埔寨接二连三地进行军事进攻，侵犯柬埔寨领土，并不断地诬蔑和威胁柬埔寨，企图掩盖它的罪恶活动。近来，美帝国主义的走狗伪政权竟然大肆叫嚷，威胁柬埔寨王国政府说：它们“有权越过柬埔寨边界追击敌人”，为美帝国主义侵略柬埔寨做舆论准备。它们不断强化老挝战争，同时还在印度支那和东南亚造成了极其危险的局势。
    美帝国主义在极力强化侵越战争，企图把战火燃遍整个印度支那的时候，竟又妄图把越南问题提交联合国，驱使联合国安全理事会插手越南战争，迫使我们接受它的条件。它放出骗人的和平谈判的论调，以掩盖它强化和扩大侵越战争的阴谋，掩盖它在越南战场上的失败并欺骗世界人民的舆论。但美帝国主义一切狡猾的欺骗论调已经骗不了任何人。今天它以无比残暴的军事手段来加强和扩大侵略战争，但这丝毫不能帮助它摆脱越陷越深的失败困境。美军进入越南南方越多，就越陷入人民战争火海的重重包围之中，越是扩大战争，就越暴露出它们在政治上、军事上的根本弱点，越来越陷入“没有出路的死胡同”。美帝国主义侵略了越南南方，越南南方军民决心用一切力量来消灭美国侵略者，不论要作出多大牺牲，不论多么艰苦，不论战争要进行五年、十年、二十年还是更长的时间，越南南方军民决心战斗到最后胜利。这是越南南方军民不可动摇的钢铁意志和决心。
      各位来宾，各位朋友：
      我们越南南方人民的正义斗争得到各社会主义国家、各民族主义国家、民族解放运动和全世界热爱和平、自由、正义的人民，其中包括美国进步人士的日益强有力的同情和支持。
      趁此机会，我们谨对热情支持我们越南人民爱国正义斗争的各国人民和政府，各个国际群众团体和个人表示衷心的感谢。
      目前越南人民的抗美救国斗争是全世界人民为反对新老殖民主义、反对以美国为首的帝国主义，为争取民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步而进行的共同斗争的不可分割的一部分。
    越南南方军民清楚地认识到这一光荣的国际义务，决心全力以赴，不惜牺牲，战斗到底，打败美帝国主义在越南南方发动的侵略战争，为全世界各民族无比伟大的革命事业作出积极和切实的贡献。
    各位来宾、各位朋友：
    中国和越南是唇齿相依的邻邦。越南南方人民一贯以深厚的感情，无限钦佩的心情关注着中国人民所取得的每个辉煌成就。中国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，发扬不断革命的精神，把中国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学技术的强大的社会主义国家。中国成功地试验第一颗氢弹，标志着中国人民的飞跃进步。越南南方人民对中国人民的伟大胜利感到极为高兴，并把这些胜利看成是自己的胜利。我们坚信在革命斗争和建设祖国的事业中，中国人民将会取得更加巨大的成就。
    越南南方人民的抗美斗争，得到了中国共产党、中国政府和兄弟的中国人民坚决的、真诚的、巨大的和有效的同情和援助。中国人民执行了毛主席关于“中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的”的指示，把自己的国家当作越南人民广阔的后方，并且全力以赴地支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。“援越抗美”高潮已在伟大的中国国土上蓬勃广泛地发展起来了。
    越南南方人民对中国人民的全心全意的支援给予极高的评价，并把它看作是对越南人民神圣的救国事业的极大鼓舞和重大贡献。
    趁此机会，我们代表团再次代表一千四百万越南南方人民向敬爱的毛主席、伟大的中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和兄弟的中国人民表示最衷心的和最深切的感谢。
    各位来宾、各位朋友：
    过去的七年，是一千四百万越南南方人民无比英勇和艰苦战斗的七年，是光辉胜利的七年。这些胜利，为越南南方人民极为有利的新发展开辟了道路。
    正在热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的越南南方军民，心情振奋，斗志昂扬，并怀着对同情和支持我们的国际朋友们的感激心情，坚决同一千七百万骨肉的北方同胞一起，以熊熊烈火之势，排山倒海之力，继续前进，更猛、更准、更狠地打击美国侵略者及其走狗，以彻底实现民族解放阵线政治纲领中所说的目标，彻底完成自己对亲爱的越南祖国的神圣任务：解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国。
    越南人民必胜，美帝国主义必败！
    越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领一定实现！
    越南南方人民和中国人民之间的牢不可破的战斗团结友谊万岁！
    为民族独立、民主、和平和社会进步而斗争的全世界革命人民的战斗团结友谊万岁！
