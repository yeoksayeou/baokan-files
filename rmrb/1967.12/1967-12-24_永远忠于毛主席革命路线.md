Thoroughly criticizing the revisionist party line of the Chinese Khrushchev is an important task in the current wave of criticism.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of our Party. Every Communist Party member must truly master Mao Zedong Thought. With the focus on "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism," we must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to fiercely criticize the revisionist party line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and become good Party members who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The following is an article written by some comrades from the South Sea Fleet of the Navy, who have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in conjunction with their own practical experiences to criticize the revisionist party line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line
	Four Four One Unit Party Committee

	For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has been vigorously advocating the "tame tool" theory. He absurdly claims: "Obedience to the organization, obedience to the majority, obedience to superiors, is absolute and unconditional." "Even if the majority or superiors are wrong, you still have to obey and first carry out the wrong orders." This is completely a policy of enslaving the people, aiming to turn the broad masses of Party members and the people into slaves who are at his beck and call, to be led by the nose down the capitalist road. This is extremely reactionary!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "For leadership that harms the revolution, one should not unconditionally accept it but should resolutely resist it." We follow Chairman Mao's teachings and have engaged in a head-on struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, resisting the erroneous leadership that harms the revolution and goes against Mao Zedong Thought.

	In 1964, Luo Ruiqing stirred up a frenzy of mass military exercises throughout the army, undermining the emphasis on politics and the high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, attempting to impose his bourgeois military line on the broad cadres and soldiers of our army. In our unit construction and actual struggles, we deeply realized that the human factor is the most important. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. If we relax the study of Chairman Mao's works, people's thoughts will regress, and combat effectiveness will decline. Therefore, we felt that something was wrong with the mass military exercises and resolutely resisted the reverse current. At the same time he sent people to the unit to organize mass military exercises, our Party committee convened a political work meeting and a seminar on studying Chairman Mao's works, repeatedly emphasizing the importance of politics and the human factor. We repeatedly warned: "Military exercises cannot replace the 'Four Firsts.' The 'Four Firsts' were proposed by Comrade Lin Biao based on Chairman Mao's military thoughts, and are the fundamental and long-term strategy of our army, which must be carried out forever." We openly criticized the theory of weapons first and vigorously propagated the importance of the human factor, thereby alerting more cadres to resist the mass military exercises and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. That year, the quality and quantity of our "Four Good" units and "Five Good" soldiers both improved.

	To be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, we must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely oppose the bourgeois military line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing. Luo Ruiqing hated us for daring to resist the mass military exercises and labeled us with the crimes of "not obeying leadership" and "disregarding organizational discipline." He even ordered us not to hold training classes for studying Chairman Mao's works for cadres. We did not pay attention to his tricks and resolutely resisted, carrying out the original plan. What we did was completely in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. We must be lawless and rebellious against the counter-revolutionary leadership of the Chinese Khrushchev and Luo Ruiqing. If we do not do this, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line cannot be carried out. In that case, the proletarian army would degenerate, and the country would change color.

	Of course, we resolutely carry out the instructions of higher authorities and obey the leadership of higher organizations. However, this is on the condition that "the leading organs of the Party must have the correct guiding line." Our correct guiding line is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, which is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The organizational line of the Party must serve the political line of the Party. Without the correct political line and without Mao Zedong Thought, the highest truth, to talk about Party unity and "absolute obedience" is to unite with the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. This is the greatest betrayal of Chairman Mao and the greatest betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the proletarian army personally created and led by Chairman Mao. We are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	The Chinese Khrushchev wants to use the shackles of "absolute obedience" to bind us, to make us follow him down the wrong path. This is absolutely impossible! We must take "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and work hard on the study. All actions must be based on the instructions of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we must resolutely support; whatever is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we must resolutely oppose.

    彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，是当前大批判的一项重要任务。
    毛泽东思想是我们党的指导思想。每一个共产党员都要“真正把毛泽东思想学到手”，以“斗私，批修”为纲，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，做一个永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的好党员。
    这里发表的，是海军南海舰队部分同志，活学活用毛主席著作，结合自己的切身体会所写的批判中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的文章。
                                                ——编者
    永远忠于毛主席革命路线
    四四一一部队党委会
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹“驯服工具”论。他胡说什么：“服从组织，服从多数，服从上级，是绝对的，无条件的。”“即使大多数或上级真错了，你也还要服从，先照错误的去执行。”这完全是实行一种愚民政策，要把广大的党员和群众变成由他任意摆布、唯命是从的奴隶，让他牵着鼻子服服贴贴地拉向资本主义道路上去。这真是反动透顶！
    毛主席教导我们：对于“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制”。我们遵循毛主席的教导，同中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿进行了针锋相对的斗争，抵制了危害革命、违反毛泽东思想的错误领导。
    一九六四年，罗瑞卿在全军刮起一股大比武的妖风，冲击突出政治，冲击已经掀起的活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，妄图把他的资产阶级建军路线强加在我军广大指战员身上。我们在部队建设中，在实际斗争中，深深地认识到，人的因素第一。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。如果放松学习毛主席著作，人的思想就要向后退，战斗力就会往下降。因而我们感到大比武的气味不对，坚决顶住逆流。就在他派人来部队组织大比武的同时，我们党委召开了政工会议和学习毛主席著作经验座谈会，大讲特讲突出政治，人的因素第一。一再给大家敲警钟：“比武不能代替‘四个第一’。‘四个第一’是林彪同志根据毛主席的建军思想提出的，是我军的根本大计，百年大计，是永远要贯彻的”。我们公开批判唯武器论，大力宣传人的因素第一，从而使越来越多的干部引起警惕，抵制了大比武，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级军事路线。这一年，我们的四好单位和五好战士的质和量，都有了上升。
    要忠于毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，就必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决反对中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线。罗瑞卿对于我们敢于抵制大比武，恨得要死，给我们扣上“不服从领导”、“目无组织纪律”的罪名。还下命令不让我们开办学习毛主席著作干部轮训班。我们没有理他那一套，坚决抵制，按原定计划进行。我们这样做，是完全符合毛主席教导的。我们对于中国赫鲁晓夫和罗瑞卿的反革命领导，就是要无法无天，一反到底。如果我们不这样做，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就不可能得到贯彻。那样，无产阶级的军队就要变质，国家就要变颜色。
    我们当然坚决执行上级的指示，服从上级机关的领导。但是，这是以“党的领导机关要有正确的指导路线”为先决条件的。我们的正确的指导路线，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。党的组织路线，必须服从党的政治路线。离开了正确的政治路线，离开毛泽东思想这个最高的真理去谈党的统一和“绝对服从”，就统一到中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线上去了。这是对毛主席的最大背叛，是对无产阶级革命事业的最大背叛。我们中国人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造、亲自领导的无产阶级军队，我们永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄想用“绝对服从”的枷锁束缚我们，要我们跟着他往邪道上走，这绝对办不到！我们一定以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫。一切行动都要以毛主席和林副主席的指示为准则，凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就坚决拥护；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，都要坚决反对。
