Red Guards Meet the Mother of a Hero

“Mother, Comrade Li, the platoon leader, sacrificed his precious life to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and to rescue us Red Guards. He is Chairman Mao's good soldier!” Cai Xuezhen, a Red Guard who was rescued from the turbulent waters of the Gan River by Comrade Li Wentong, tearfully recounted Li Wentong's heroic deeds while leaning against the mother of the "model for supporting the left and loving the people" Li Wentong.

Li's mother, treating this young Red Guard from the Jinggangshan area as her own child, affectionately said, “Wentong did the right thing. His sacrifice is glorious, and I am not sad. I am willing to send another son to take his place.”

Sixteen-year-old Cai Xuezhen, to report on the deeds of the Fourth Platoon in supporting the left and loving the people to the people and troops of the hero's hometown, joined the “Reporting Team on the Heroic Deeds of Li Wentong and Others and the Fourth Platoon's Support for the Left and Love for the People.” This team was jointly organized by the Preparatory Committee for the Great Alliance of Revolutionary Masses of Jiangxi Province, the Red Guard Headquarters of Schools and Colleges, and the 601st Unit. She came to Shandong this day with the reporting team to visit Li Wentong's family. As soon as they arrived at Li Wentong's home, they surrounded Li's mother like long-lost children, saying, “Mother, your children have come to visit you.” They expressed to the hero's mother: Comrade Li, the platoon leader, will forever be our good example. We must learn from Comrade Li to love what Chairman Mao loves, support what Chairman Mao supports, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and advance when Chairman Mao waves his hand.

Li's mother, stroking each revolutionary youngster, looked up at Chairman Mao's portrait and affectionately said, “You are all Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, the most obedient to Chairman Mao. Seeing your determination to follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, I am truly happy.”

Li Fuyu, the village party branch secretary who stood up to revolution with Li Wentong's help, also came to reunite with the youngsters that day. He said, “Wentong is a good comrade. He helped me a lot. In 1962, he helped me resist the 'three selfs and one contract' single farming wind pushed by China's Khrushchev in our village. After the Cultural Revolution began, he helped me stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels. He told me that studying Chairman Mao's works requires hard work on the 'use' aspect, finding gaps when there are achievements, and learning from Yu Gong when there are difficulties. Wentong sacrificed himself gloriously. I will learn from him better and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death, making our village's Cultural Revolution even better.”

The youngsters brought Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao's portrait, and Chairman Mao's badges to the hero's mother. Everyone pitched in, hanging Chairman Mao's portrait and Chairman Mao's quotations in the room where Li Wentong lived. Li's mother pointed to the top of the window and said, “Hang the largest portrait of Chairman Mao right here, so that every morning when I open my eyes, I can see him, always living in Chairman Mao's presence. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no us, and without Chairman Mao's education, Wentong would not have been so brave. We must forever follow Chairman Mao, generation after generation, without changing our hearts.”

As noon approached, the wind picked up outside. The youngsters carefully helped Li's mother put on a coat and escorted her to the commune to participate in the “Learning from the Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People, Comrade Li Wentong, Pledge Rally.” At the rally of several thousand people, the members of the “Reporting Team on the Heroic Deeds of Li Wentong and Others and the Fourth Platoon's Support for the Left and Love for the People” reported the model deeds of Li Wentong and others to the people of the hero's hometown. They also, on behalf of the revolutionary masses of Jiangxi, presented a banner to Li Wentong's family, on which was embroidered Chairman Mao's inscription for the martyr Liu Hulan: “Glorious in life, glorious in death.”

　　红卫兵小将会见英雄的妈妈
    “妈妈，李排长为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，为了抢救我们红卫兵，献出了自己宝贵的生命。他是毛主席的好战士！……”被李文忠同志从赣江激流中抢救出来的红卫兵小将蔡雪珍，含着激动的泪水，依傍在“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志的妈妈身边，滔滔不绝地叙说着李文忠同志的英雄事迹。
    李妈妈象对自己亲生儿女一样，亲切地对这个来自井冈山地区的小将说：“文忠这孩子做得对。他的牺牲是光荣的，俺不难过。俺要再送一个儿子去接他的班。”
    十六岁的蔡雪珍，为了向烈士家乡的人民和驻军汇报英雄四排的支左爱民事迹，参加了由江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会、大中学校红卫兵司令部和六○一一部队联合组成的“李文忠等烈士及四排支左爱民英雄事迹报告团”，来到山东。这天，她是同报告团的同志一起，专程来看望李文忠同志的亲人的。他们一到李文忠同志的家，就象久别的孩子见到了亲人，一齐围住李妈妈说：“妈妈，您的儿女们来看望您老人家了。”他们向英雄的妈妈表示：李排长永远是我们学习的好榜样。我们一定要象李排长那样，做到：毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。
    李妈妈用手抚摸着一个个革命小将，仰望着毛主席的像，亲切地说：“你们都是毛主席的红小兵，最听毛主席的话，看到你们这种坚决跟着毛主席闹革命的劲头，俺心里真是高兴。”
    曾经在李文忠同志的帮助下站起来革命的本村党支部书记李福玉，这天也来和小将们团聚。他说：“文忠是个好同志。他对我帮助可大了。一九六二年，他帮助我顶住了中国赫鲁晓夫在我们村推行的‘三自一包’的单干风，文化大革命开始后，他又帮助我站到革命造反派一边。他告诉我，学毛主席著作要在“用”字上狠下功夫，有了成绩找差距，有了困难学愚公。文忠光荣地牺牲了，我要更好地学习他，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，把我们村的文化大革命搞得更好。”
    小将们给英雄的妈妈带来了毛主席著作、毛主席画像和毛主席像章。大家一齐动手，在李文忠住过的屋子里，张贴毛主席像和毛主席语录。李妈妈指着窗子上边说：“这张最大的毛主席像，就贴在这个窗子的上边，让俺每天早晨一睁眼，就能看到他老人家，时刻都在毛主席身边过日子。没有毛主席，也就没有我们，没有毛主席的教育，文忠也不会那么勇敢。我们要永远紧跟毛主席，世世代代不变心。”
    快近中午，外面起了风。小将们关切地给李妈妈披上大衣，搀扶着她去公社参加“向支左爱民模范李文忠同志学习誓师大会”。在几千人的誓师大会上，“李文忠等烈士及四排支左爱民英雄事迹报告团”的同志们，向烈士家乡的人民报告了李文忠等烈士的模范事迹，并且代表江西无产阶级革命派，向李文忠烈士的家属，赠送了锦旗，上面绣着毛主席为刘胡兰烈士的题词：“生的伟大，死的光荣。”　（新华社记者）
