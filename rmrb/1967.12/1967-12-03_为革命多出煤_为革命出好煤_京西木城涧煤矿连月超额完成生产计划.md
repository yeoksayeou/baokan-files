The revolutionary workers of the Jixi Mucity Gorge Coal Mine, following the guideline of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," have established extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought. They have deeply studied, memorized, and applied the "Old Three Articles," fostering the spirit of "mining for the revolution." The entire mine is thriving with revolutionary and production activities. In October, they completed 5.4% over the state's coal production plan, and in November, they achieved a 13% overproduction of raw coal and a 6% overproduction of advance meters.

Since the revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary workers of the entire mine achieved revolutionary great unity in September, they have further deepened and broadened the revolutionary criticism, continuously consolidating and developing the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in terms of ideology. The revolutionary workers of the entire mine, united around the revolutionary committee, have joined forces to seize the revolution and promote production, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

Currently, many workshops, teams, and family areas in this mine have established study classes on Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary workers place the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. They regard deeply studying, memorizing, and applying the "Old Three Articles" as a compulsory course for every revolutionary worker to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. They actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "use" aspect, making Mao Zedong Thought widely popular throughout the mine. The revolutionary workers' spirit of mining for the revolution and communist cooperative spirit have been greatly promoted.

To produce more and better coal for the state, the ground support departments and family members of this mine have also put forward the battle slogan of "supporting the production front line." More than 200 ground workers frequently go down the mine to participate in the coal production battle.

Revolutionary workers have further strengthened labor discipline, significantly improving attendance rates and work hour utilization. They are determined to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." They insist on making revolution in their spare time and saving in their spare time, striving for greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and this year's production.
