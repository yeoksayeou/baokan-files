	The great commander-in-chief has issued a call,
	The spirit is grand, shaking the heavens and earth:
	China and Vietnam are brothers in arms,
	United in struggle, hearts as one!
	The Vietnamese people show great heroism,
	The flames of war burn through the palm groves;
	The power of the people's war is immense,
	The American aggressors cannot escape their fate.
	The Chinese people's spirit is heroic,
	The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high,
	The winds of the five continents are in our hearts,
	The revolutionary burden is on our shoulders!
	Seven hundred million people and soldiers are full of fighting spirit,
	Guns loaded, swords drawn;
	Waiting for the country's order,
	To aid Vietnam and resist America, achieving great deeds!
