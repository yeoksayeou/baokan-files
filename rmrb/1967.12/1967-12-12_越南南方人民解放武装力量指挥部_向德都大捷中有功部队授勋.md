The Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam has recently decided to award the First-Class Liberation Military Merit Medal to a certain unit of the Liberation Army for its outstanding achievements in the battles in the Dak To area of Kontum Province.

From November 3 to 22, this unit of the Liberation Army engaged in nearly sixty large and small battles with the enemy in the Dak To area, annihilating and severely damaging eight enemy battalions, annihilating and dispersing the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade, killing over 4,000 enemy troops, including nearly 3,300 American soldiers. They also shot down and destroyed 38 enemy aircraft of various types, destroyed two airfields, knocked out 15 artillery pieces and 32 military vehicles, burned down three fuel depots and one ammunition depot storing thousands of tons of ammunition, and blew up two bridges.

It is also reported that the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam has recently decided to award the Second-Class Liberation Military Merit Medal to the first banner of the People's Militia and Guerrilla Forces in the Central South Region—the People's Militia and Guerrilla Forces of Boa County, Binh Duong Province—for their outstanding achievements in production and combat, especially in shooting down enemy aircraft.

The report states that from January to July this year, the military and civilians of Boa County shot down 75 enemy aircraft. Among them, the guerrilla forces shot down 68 enemy aircraft using rifles, including 17 bombers, 30 fighter jets, 10 transport planes, and 11 L-19 type aircraft, and damaged 78 aircraft. In particular, from June 24 to July 2, the guerrilla forces of Boa County thwarted the enemy's large-scale "sweeping" operations, killing 443 enemy troops and shooting down 30 enemy aircraft. The movement to shoot down enemy aircraft has become a widespread mass movement in Boa County.
