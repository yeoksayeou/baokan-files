The economic construction exhibition of the People's Republic of China successfully closed in the northern capital of Somalia, Hargeisa, after a 15-day exhibition.

The Chinese economic construction exhibition brought a new vitality to this mountain city. Whether in shop windows, on the walls along the streets, or on taxis and long-distance transport trucks, colorful portraits of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, could be seen everywhere. Enthusiastic Somalis would wave and greet the members of the Chinese exhibition delegation when they encountered them on the street, shouting "China, Mao Zedong!" and "Long live Mao Zedong!"

The good news of the Chinese economic construction exhibition spread to the other two major cities in northern Somalia, Berbera and Burao, and to the vast pastoral areas of Somalia. Many herdsmen, students, and merchants traveled from far and wide to Hargeisa to visit the Chinese exhibition. For a time, Hargeisa was bustling with activity, and the grand building displaying the exhibits attracted countless men, women, children, and the elderly from morning to night.

Somalian audiences expressed their boundless admiration for the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. They highly praised the great leader Chairman Mao and his brilliant thoughts, and highly evaluated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. A Somali friend said, "Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have made astonishing progress in all fields over the past 18 years. We Somalis regard China as our example."

Many Somalian viewers wrote down their heartfelt feelings in the guest book. One viewer wrote: "The excellent exhibits here show that such a young country as China has made such tremendous progress in all aspects, which is rare in history. All these achievements should be attributed to the invincible thoughts of the great leader Chairman Mao."

Another viewer wrote: Under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has accelerated the development of the People's Republic of China over the past 18 years. A viewer wrote: "We have seen the results of Mao Zedong Thought from the exhibition." Some viewers wrote: "Chairman Mao is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of the oppressed people in Africa, Asia, and the world. Long live Chairman Mao!"

After visiting the exhibition, Somalian friends loved the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, even more. During the exhibition, many Somalian friends lined up every night to get Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao badges. Now, throughout northern Somalia, even in small villages in the jungle, men, women, and children all know the glorious name of Chairman Mao. A little boy said, "I know Chairman Mao, I respect him very much."

This exhibition also demonstrated the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Somalia, which is based on anti-imperialism. A Somali student told a reporter, "On our land, everyone loves Chairman Mao Zedong. We hate the imperialists."

　　我经济建设展览会在索马里胜利闭幕
　　索马里人民说中国取得巨大成就归功于伟大的毛泽东思想
    据新华社摩加迪沙十五日电　中华人民共和国经济建设展览会在成功地展出十五天以后，十四日晚在索马里北部首府哈尔格萨胜利闭幕。
    中国经济建设展览会给这座山城增添了生气。无论在商店橱窗里、在街道两旁的墙壁上、在出租汽车或长途运输卡车上……都可以看到中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的彩色像。热情的索马里人在街上遇到中国展览代表团人员的时候，总是向他们挥手致意，高呼“中国，毛泽东！”“毛泽东万岁！”
    中国经济建设展览会展出的喜讯传到了索马里北部的另外两个主要城市贝尔贝拉和布劳，传到了索马里广阔的游牧地区。许多牧民、学生和商人从很远很远的地方来到哈尔格萨市参观中国展览会。一时间，哈尔格萨市热闹非常，展出展品的那座雄伟建筑物从早到晚，吸引了无数男女老少观众。
    索马里观众对中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就表示无限钦佩，他们高度赞扬伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的光辉思想，高度评价中国无产阶级文化大革命。一位索马里朋友说：“中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，十八年来在各个领域内取得了惊人的进展。我们索马里人民把中国作为我们的榜样。”
    许多索马里观众在留言簿上写下了他们出自内心的感受。一位观众写道：“这里展出的出色展品表明，中国这样年青的国家在各个方面取得了这样巨大的进步，这在历史上是罕见的。所有这些成就都应归功于伟大的领袖毛主席的战无不胜的思想。”
    另一位观众写道：中华人民共和国十八年来取得了巨大发展，伟大领袖毛主席英明领导下的无产阶级文化大革命加速了这种进展。一位观众写道：“我们从展览会里看到了毛泽东思想的成果。”有的观众写道：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的领袖，而且是非洲、亚洲以及全世界一切被压迫人民的领袖。毛主席万岁！”
    索马里朋友们在参观了展览之后，更加热爱世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席。在展览期间，每天晚上都有许多索马里朋友排着长队索取毛主席著作和毛主席像章。现在在整个索马里北部，甚至在丛林中的小村庄，男女老少都知道毛主席的光辉名字。一个小朋友说：“我知道毛主席，我非常敬爱他。”
    这次展览会也显示了中索两国人民建立在反帝基础上的深厚友谊。一个索马里学生对记者说：“在我们的土地上，我们每一个人都热爱毛泽东主席。我们憎恨帝国主义者。”
