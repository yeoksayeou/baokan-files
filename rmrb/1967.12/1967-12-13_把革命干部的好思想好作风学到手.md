The great leader Chairman Mao has issued the latest directive that "military-run study classes should include soldiers." I was fortunate to participate in the first session of the cadre and soldier joint study class of Mao Zedong Thought organized by our unit, and I also participated in the leadership of the study class. Through the study, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao's directive is the most brilliant and the greatest. Studying together with the cadres for twenty days, the cadres taught us ideology, passed on traditions, and demonstrated good conduct. They fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism with us, which further promoted our ideological revolutionization.

I enlisted in 1966. At the time, I had a wrong thought: I thought that since there was no war, serving a few years as a "peace soldier" was quite comfortable. I had exposed and struggled against this bad thought before. This time, when I participated in the study class, I did not plan to expose it again. However, when it was time to expose our thoughts, the first to speak up was the deputy chief of staff, who had been in the revolution for more than twenty years. He exposed his selfishness without shame and fought against it without fear, with every word filled with hatred for the "self." It was like he was fighting the enemy with bayonets on the battlefield. The deputy chief of staff's actions gave me a great education. I struggled in my mind and thought: In times of war, the older generation went to the frontlines for the people, fearless of bloodshed and sacrifice; now, in the socialist revolution, they follow Chairman Mao's words and bravely lead the fight against selfishness and revisionism. Comparing myself, why was I so afraid to expose my selfishness? Thus, I made up my mind to learn from the older generation, thoroughly exposing my selfish thoughts, and fiercely fighting and criticizing them. With the help of my comrades, I achieved a great victory in fighting against selfishness.

Our study class not only studied together but also worked together. One day, we went to the beach to dig sweet potatoes. Stepping onto the shore, the wind was howling, and the dust was flying, making it uncomfortable. I thought, it's good enough to study well in the study class; as for labor, the company often has it, and there's no need to include it as part of the study class curriculum. As soon as this selfish thought flashed through my mind, I looked up and saw that our unit's political commissar, chief of staff, and other leading cadres were already there, wielding their hoes and working hard. Facing this scene, I thought while working, in times of war, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army held guns in one hand and hoes in the other, carrying out large-scale production movements, overcoming difficulties, and defeating the enemy. This is the glorious tradition of our army. These glorious traditions still shine brightly in our revolutionary cadres. This is an important measure to ensure that our country does not produce revisionism. We must inherit and carry forward these good traditions. Thinking of this, I felt a surge of boundless energy, working hard next to the political commissar, and all the fatigue and dirt vanished!

Through twenty days of study, the relationship between cadres and soldiers became closer, and class feelings deepened. The cadres' education and help greatly raised our awareness. I am determined to further learn from them, inherit the good traditions and styles of our army, accelerate ideological revolutionization through fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and become a reliable successor to the revolutionary cause.

### 把革命干部的好思想好作风学到手

　　把革命干部的好思想好作风学到手
　　驻沪空军某部战士　荀昭安
    伟大领袖毛主席发出了“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的最新指示。我幸福地参加了我们部队举办的第一期干部、战士同学习的毛泽东思想学习班，并且参加了学习班领导小组的领导工作。通过学习，我深深体会到，毛主席的这一指示最英明、最伟大。和干部一起学习二十天，领导干部对我们教思想、传传统、带作风，同我们一起斗私批修，更好地促进了我们的思想革命化。
    我是一九六六年入伍的。入伍时有个活思想：认为现在不打仗，当几年“和平兵”，倒也蛮舒服。我的这个坏思想，以前亮过，也斗过。这次参加学习班，本来我不准备再亮了。可是在亮思想的时候，第一个抢先亮的是参加革命二十多年的副参谋长。他亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕痛，一字一句充满了对“私”字的仇和恨，就象当年在战场上和敌人拚刺刀一样。副参谋长的行动，给了我很大的教育，我思想斗争得很激烈，心中又想：在战争年代，老一辈为人民赴汤蹈火，不怕流血牺牲；如今在社会主义革命时期，他们又听毛主席的话，勇当斗私的先锋，批修的闯将。对照检查自己，为什么亮私这么怕呢？于是，我下定决心，向老一辈学习，彻底亮出了私心杂念，狠斗猛批，在同志们的帮助下，取得了斗私的很大胜利。
    我们的学习班不仅同学习，而且同劳动。有一天，我们去海滩刨地瓜。踏上海岸，大风呼呼，尘土飞扬，吹在身上很不舒服。我想，学习班好好学习就是了，劳动嘛，连队里经常有，用不着再作为学习班的课程了。当私心在脑海中闪过的一刹那，我抬头看到我们部队的政委、参谋长和其他领导干部早已在那里挥舞着钉耙大干起来了。面对这种情景，我一边劳动一边想，在战争年代，八路军、新四军，一手拿枪、一手拿镐，开展大生产运动，克服了困难，战胜了敌人。这是我军的光荣传统。这些光荣传统在我们的革命领导干部身上还闪闪发光。这是保证我国不出修正主义的重要措施。我们就是要把这些好传统继承下来，发扬光大。想到这里，我浑身增添了无穷的力量，靠在政委旁边拚命地干着，什么累呀，脏呀，扫个精光！
    通过二十天的学习，干部、战士的关系更密切了，阶级感情更深了。干部们对我们的教育和帮助，大大提高了我们的觉悟水平。我决心进一步向他们学习，继承我军的好传统、好作风，通过斗私批修，加速思想革命化，当可靠的革命事业的接班人。
