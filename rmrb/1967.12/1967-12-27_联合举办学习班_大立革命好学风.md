The People's Liberation Army's Shenyang Garrison's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team at the Shenyang Bearing Factory

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes jointly organized by the three factions and seven mass organizations of the Shenyang Bearing Factory were established under the radiant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China.

The working class listens to Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao said: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The workers of the Bearing Factory, after studying Chairman Mao's teachings, immediately put them into practice. They established a revolutionary great alliance preparatory committee according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Deputy Chairman Lin transmitted Chairman Mao's instructions to establish study classes at the National Day celebration in the capital, calling for the nationwide establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They acted promptly upon hearing this. We assisted the factory's factions in jointly organizing two sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes since late October, and the third session is currently underway.

We feel that the responsible individuals and the masses from the various factions being able to sit together and jointly organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a good beginning to promote a revolutionary learning style that combines theory with practice and learning with application. The workers say, "Studying Mao Zedong Thought is the highest common interest of our working class. On this issue, we have no differences; we must study together to the end." Through jointly organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, studying the "Old Five Articles" together, and engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism together, hostile sentiments have been eliminated, unity has been strengthened, petty-bourgeois factionalism has been overcome, and proletarian party spirit has been enhanced, promoting the revolutionization of thought.

Leaders Set an Example in Combining Theory with Practice

Whether the responsible individuals of the various mass organizations can lead in establishing a good learning style that combines theory with practice and learning with application is a key factor in determining whether the Mao Zedong Thought study classes can be successfully conducted. The reason why the Mao Zedong Thought study classes jointly organized by the three factions of the Bearing Factory have been able to continue and improve is that the responsible individuals of the various mass organizations have done a good job in this regard.

The responsible individuals of the three factions and seven organizations participated in the first and second sessions of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Initially, when they sat together to study, they each had their own thoughts, preparing "gunners" and "ammunition" to argue who is superior. However, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "The two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak about their own shortcomings and errors, and engage in more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences," they rectified their learning style according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Everyone realized that having a serious spirit of self-criticism is a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, a question of loyalty to Chairman Mao. The responsible individuals of the mass organizations led by listening to Chairman Mao's words, leading in executing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strictly demanding of themselves, and voluntarily taking responsibility. The responsible individuals of the various factions conducted self-criticism with a high attitude, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon to review and examine their performance in the Cultural Revolution over the past year, fiercely fighting against selfishness, and sweeping away petty-bourgeois factionalism. They not only exposed themselves thoroughly and fought fiercely but also changed quickly. When someone from their own faction posted big-character posters provoking the opposing faction, the leaders, with the overall situation in mind, would dissuade them if they found out, and cover them up if they were already posted. The masses followed the leaders' good example and learned from their good learning style.

When the revolutionary learning style was disrupted during the study, the responsible individuals of the various mass organizations, especially the top leaders, could consider the overall situation and step forward, maintaining the revolutionary good learning style at critical moments. The study classes had several instances where, due to the responsible individuals of the various factions influencing the masses with a revolutionary learning style, tense emotions were promptly eliminated, seeking common ground while reserving differences, allowing the study classes to continue. Thus, the entire factory presented a situation where leaders led the masses and the masses promoted the leaders, sparking a self-aware revolutionary fervor within the study classes.

Discussing Achievements by Excluding Oneself, Discussing Shortcomings by Including Oneself

The broad masses of revolutionary workers at this factory, under Chairman Mao's great call to "pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," successively established their own combat organizations, fiercely denounced the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and fiercely denounced the capitalist reactionary line. The history of rebellion has its early and late stages, and the number of organizational members varies. They have all made contributions to the Cultural Revolution, and in the great storms of class struggle, it is inevitable that various shortcomings and errors will emerge. However, due to the influence of selfishness, they often use a magnifying glass to look at others' shortcomings and a microscope to look at their own advantages, the more they look, the more petty-bourgeois factionalism they see, the less proletarian party spirit they have, and the greater the differences.

In the study classes, we studied the "Old Five Articles" together with the participating comrades, reminisced about past hardships and sweetness together, and enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness, the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The more they praised, the more they loved Chairman Mao, the more loyal they were to Chairman Mao. They all said, "No matter how many victories there are, all victories belong to the great leader Chairman Mao."

The more they praised, the more they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They deeply understood through repeated study and profound comprehension that the fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to, while seizing power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, seize the power of the "self" in one's mind, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, reform worldviews, firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, and build an iron Great Wall in one's mind to prevent and oppose revisionism. They said: Only by listening to Chairman Mao's words and conducting serious self-criticism can one spark a revolution in the depths of one's soul and liberate oneself. The earlier one conducts self-criticism, the earlier one is liberated; the later one conducts self-criticism, the later one is liberated; if one does not conduct self-criticism, one cannot be liberated from selfishness and cannot keep up with Chairman Mao. In the study, everyone ensured that when discussing achievements, they actively excluded themselves, and when discussing shortcomings, they consciously included themselves. They extensively exposed the manifestations of selfishness, extensively discussed the harm of selfishness, extensively dug out the roots of selfishness, placed the battlefield in the depths of their souls, and directed their cannons at China's Khrushchev, digging at him and remembering their grudges against him. Everyone saw the common enemy, had a common language, and talked heart to heart. By the end of the study class, a unity atmosphere that had not been seen in over a year emerged.

In the study classes, problems were presented, and answers were sought from the masses

Jointly organizing study classes by several factions cannot be done in isolation; they must be open. From the beginning, the Bearing Factory adopted a method of combining internal and external classes, presenting problems within the class, and according to Chairman Mao's teachings, going to the masses to learn, seeking answers from the masses to solve practical issues. This approach yielded significant results.

In the first session of the study class, someone raised the question: "The establishment of the factory's revolutionary great alliance preparatory committee is premature and is a 'premature birth.'" Regarding this question, they did not sit in the room and engage in empty debates to resolve it but instead took the question to the various factions of the masses for investigation, learned from the masses, and absorbed nutrients from the masses. Their investigation results showed that the vast majority of workers supported the revolutionary great alliance preparatory committee. The workers also presented many favorable conditions for achieving revolutionary great alliance, demanding the swift realization of the factory's revolutionary great alliance to jointly fight and grasp the grand direction. The masses' strong desire for revolutionary great alliance educated the comrades in the study class, corrected their attitudes, strengthened their confidence, and deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Some responsible individuals of the mass organizations deeply felt, "We can only be promoters of revolutionary great alliance and cannot be obstacles to great alliance." By taking the question to the masses, deeply investigating and researching, being humble students of the masses, and learning from the masses with an open mind, they not only educated the students but also educated the masses, simultaneously solving problems and achieving the effects of combining learning with application and seeing immediate results. They tasted the sweetness of establishing a revolutionary good learning style advocated by Chairman Mao and successfully conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

    联合举办学习班  大立革命好学风
    人民解放军沈阳部队驻沈阳市轴承厂毛泽东思想宣传队
    沈阳市轴承厂三派七个群众组织联合举办的毛泽东思想学习班，是在伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的最新指示的光辉照耀下办起来的。
    工人阶级最听毛主席的话。毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”轴承厂的广大工人学了毛主席的教导，立即照办，他们按照毛主席的指示，几派协商成立了革命大联合筹备小组。林副主席在首都国庆节大会上传达了毛主席举办学习班的指示，号召全国大办毛泽东思想学习班，他们闻风而动。我们协助这个厂的几派组织，从十月下旬以来，已经联合办了两期毛泽东思想学习班，目前正在办第三期。
    我们感到，几派组织负责人和群众能够坐到一起合办毛泽东思想学习班，就是发扬理论联系实际、学用结合的革命学风的良好开端。工人们说，学习毛泽东思想是我们工人阶级共同的最高利益，在这个问题上，我们没有一点分歧，一定要在一起学到底。通过合办毛泽东思想学习班，共同学习毛主席最新指示，共同学习“老五篇”，共同斗私批修，对立情绪消除了，团结增强了，小资产阶级派性有了克服，无产阶级党性有了加强，促进了思想革命化。
    头头带头做出理论联系实际的好样子
    各派群众组织负责人能不能带头树立理论联系实际、学用结合的好学风，是决定毛泽东思想学习班能不能办得好的一个关键。轴承厂几派合办的毛泽东思想学习班所以能够连续办下来，而且越办越好，就是因为各派群众组织负责人在理论联系实际、学用结合这方面做得比较好。
    这个厂三派七个组织的负责人，是参加第一、第二两期毛泽东思想学习班学习的。开始，他们坐到一起来学习，还各有各的想法，安排了“炮手”、“炮弹”，准备趁这个机会辩个谁高谁低。但是，在学习了毛主席的最新指示“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”以后，他们按照毛主席的教导，整顿了学风。大家认识到，有没有认真的自我批评精神，是对毛主席和毛泽东思想的根本态度问题，是对毛主席忠不忠的问题。群众组织负责人带头听毛主席的话，带头执行毛主席的最新指示，严格要求自己，主动承担责任。各派组织负责人高姿态地做自我批评，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，回顾和检查了自己一年多来在文化大革命中的表现，狠斗私心，横扫小资产阶级派性。他们不仅亮得透，斗得狠，而且改得也快。当自己这一派有人贴刺激对方的大字报时，头头们能以大局为重，发现了就劝阻，贴上了再覆盖。群众纷纷效仿头头的好榜样，学习头头的好学风。
    在学习中革命学风受到干扰的时候，各派群众组织负责人、特别是第一把手能顾全大局，挺身而出，在关键的时候，维护革命的好学风。学习班曾几次出现这种情况，由于各派负责人以革命的学风影响群众，及时地消除了紧张情绪，求大同，存小异，使学习班坚持办下来。这样，全厂出现了头头带群众，群众促头头的新局面，在学习班里掀起了自觉革命的热潮。
  谈成绩把自己划出来，谈缺点把自己摆进去
    这个厂的广大革命工人，在毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召下，先后成立了自己的战斗组织，大造党内一小撮走资派的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反。造反历史有早有晚，组织人数有多有少，对文化大革命都作出了贡献，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，也难免出现这样那样的缺点、错误。但由于“私”字作怪，往往是用放大镜看人家的缺点，用显微镜看自己的优点，越看小资产阶级派性越多，无产阶级党性越少，分歧越大。
    在学习班里，我们和参加学习的同志一起学习“老五篇”，一起忆苦思甜，一起大颂特颂毛主席的英明伟大，大颂特颂毛泽东思想的无穷威力，大颂特颂毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。大家越颂扬，越热爱毛主席，越忠于毛主席。都说，千胜利万胜利，一切胜利归功于伟大领袖毛主席。
    大家越颂扬，越爱学习毛主席的最新指示。他们对毛主席的最新指示经过反复学习、深刻领会，进一步认识到，无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的，就是要在夺党内一小撮走资派的权的同时，夺头脑里“私”字的权，破私立公，改造世界观，大立毛泽东思想，在头脑里筑起防修反修的钢铁长城。他们说：只有听毛主席的话，认真地进行自我批评，才能在灵魂深处爆发革命，自己解放自己。早做自我批评早解放，晚做自我批评晚解放，不做自我批评就不能从“私”字中解放出来，就不能紧跟毛主席。在学习中大家做到谈成绩主动地把自己划出来，谈缺点自觉地把自己摆进去。大摆“私”字的表现，大谈“私”字的危害，大挖“私”字的根源，把战场摆在灵魂深处，把炮弹射向中国赫鲁晓夫，根往他身上挖，仇往他身上记。大家看清了共同的敌人，有了共同的语言，大家互相谈心交心，学习班结束时，出现了一年多来从未有过的团结气氛。
    在学习班里摆问题，到群众中去找答案
    几派合办学习班，不能关门办学，要开门办学。轴承厂一开始就采取班内外相结合的办法，在班里摆问题，按照毛主席的教导，到群众中去，向群众学习，在群众中找答案，来解决活思想。这样做，取得了显著效果。
    在第一期学习班中，有人曾经提出过这样一个问题：“厂里革命大联合筹备小组的成立，条件不成熟，是‘早产儿’”。对于这个问题，他们不是坐在屋里头凭空的辩论解决，而是带着问题到各派群众中去做调查，向群众学习，从群众中吸取营养。他们调查结果，绝大多数工人都支持革命大联合筹备小组。工人们还摆出了许多实现革命大联合的有利条件，要求尽快实现全厂的革命大联合，共同战斗，抓好大方向。群众强烈要求实现革命大联合的愿望，教育了学习班的同志，端正了态度，坚定了信心，加深了对毛主席最新指示的理解。有的群众组织负责人深有所感地说：“我们只能当革命大联合的促进派，不能当阻碍大联合的绊脚石。”这样带着问题深入群众，深入实际，进行调查研究，做群众的小学生，虚心向群众学习，既教育了学员，又教育了群众，同时解决了问题，收到了学用结合、立竿见影的效果，尝到了建立毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，办好毛泽东思想学习班的甜头。
