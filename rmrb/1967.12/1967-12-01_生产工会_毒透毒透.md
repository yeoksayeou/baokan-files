The “production union” is poisonous to the core. The Shanghai Railway Bureau’s “Iron Alliance” Revolutionary Rebel Corps of the Shanghai Railway District Workers’ Union of the Workers’ General Headquarters vehemently denounces the fact that the Chinese Khrushchev has been vigorously promoting the revisionist line of labor movement, claiming that “the history of human society, ultimately, is the history of production,” “the production movement is the workers’ movement,” and “production is the sole task of the factory,” etc. He madly opposes turning the union into a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Following the instructions of their black master, the capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Railway Bureau have maliciously advocated that union cadres should not be empty-headed politicians, that the union should focus on production competitions, mechanization, and living welfare, but not on organizing workers to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, not on organizing workers to emphasize politics, not on organizing workers to revolutionize their thoughts. Under their poisonous influence, our bureau’s union also believes that focusing on production is visible, tangible, and makes noise, pleasing the Party committee and administrative support, and pleasing everyone. Focusing on politics is invisible, intangible, and far from solving immediate problems, making it hard work for nothing. Therefore, for a long time, it has not been led by Mao Zedong Thought, not emphasizing politics and class struggle as the key, but emphasizing production as the overriding center, turning the union into a “production union.” The masses reflect that “the Party committee issues orders, the administration sets targets, and the union follows suit.” All the work of the union revolves around the theme of “production.” To improve workers’ skills and professional knowledge, the union’s extracurricular education is divided into “cultural education” and “professional education,” but there is no “political education.” To closely combine with production, it emphasizes technical courses, technical performance competitions, and basic skills training. It also sets up many labor-intensive, formalistic training items. To force workers to practice day and night, it not only maliciously sets up inspection systems such as open inspections, secret inspections, self-inspections, and mutual inspections, but also deliberately sets up obstacles to test workers’ technical levels, making workers dizzy, nervous, and squeezing out the time to study Chairman Mao’s works. In terms of workers’ extracurricular life, it advocates that “production time should be tense and laborious, and extracurricular life should be relaxed and enjoyable,” such as “eating well, sleeping well, playing well, and workers will have the energy to produce.” In short, under the poisonous influence of the revisionist line of labor movement that emphasizes production as the center and integrates production, life, and education, all aspects of the union’s work must serve “production,” stripping the workers’ movement of its revolutionary soul, making the union detached from class struggle, revolution, and proletarian politics, and heading towards the revisionist path.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “Political work is the lifeline of all economic work.” However, the number one traitor and labor thief, the Chinese Khrushchev, openly defies Chairman Mao’s instructions, talking about advanced production technology and advanced production quotas, but not about political leadership and the revolutionization of people’s thoughts. Under the black instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, for a long time, our bureau’s union has been keen on promoting a set of “target leadership” and “technical leadership” production competitions, importing a large number of black experiences from the Soviet revisionists, focusing on the tangible and ignoring the intangible, seeing things but not people. Workers have sharply criticized: “This method, that method, but there is no good method of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works,” “this experience, that experience, but there is no good experience of how to emphasize politics.” For more than ten years, our bureau’s labor competitions have been varied and numerous, but they all boil down to comparing targets and competing for quotas. The “Five-Goods” movement is also in line with the black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices’ “four goods for one good,” claiming that “good production is good politics,” and “five goods, six goods, as long as the task is completed and no accidents occur, it is considered good.”

The Chinese Khrushchev, this great traitor and labor thief, promotes the “production union” with evil intentions, which is actually to suppress revolution with production, making us workers focus on production, not ask about politics, forget about class struggle, forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, and allow this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists to carry out “peaceful evolution” and restore capitalism in China. Their intentions are so sinister, and their methods are so vicious! We must rise up with the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the revisionist line of labor movement of the Chinese Khrushchev, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, vowing to turn the revolutionary mass organizations of the working class into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    “生产工会”毒透毒透
    工总司“铁联”上海铁路区工会革命造反队
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力推行修正主义工运路线，胡说什么“人类社会的历史，归根结底是生产的历史”，“生产运动就是工人运动”，“生产就是工厂的唯一任务”等等，疯狂地反对把工会办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    上海铁路局党内走资本主义道路当权派根据其黑主子的旨意，别有用心地叫嚷工会干部不要做空头的政治家，要工会大搞生产竞赛，大抓机械化，大办生活福利，就是不要工会组织职工活学活用毛主席著作，就是不要工会组织抓突出政治，就是不要工会抓人的思想革命化。我局工会在他们的毒害下，也认为抓生产是看得见，摸得到，喊得响，党委满意，行政支持，八面讨好；抓政治是看不见，摸不到，远水救不了近火，吃力不讨好。因此长期以来，不是用毛泽东思想挂帅，不是突出政治、以阶级斗争为纲，而是突出了生产，把生产作为压倒一切的中心，把工会办成了“生产工会”。群众反映“党委发号召，行政提指标，工会跑龙套”，工会的一切工作都是围绕“生产”这个题目做文章。为了使职工“提高技术，钻研业务”，把工会业余教育分成“文化教育”、“专业教育”两个部分，就是没有“政治教育”这个部分。为了紧密结合生产，就大上技术课，大搞技术表演赛，大练基本功。还规定了许多劳民伤财的、形式主义的练功项目。为了迫使工人日夜练功，不仅恶毒地规定了明查、暗查、自查、互查等等检查制度，甚至故意设置障碍来试探工人的技术水平，弄得工人头昏脑胀，神经紧张，挤掉了学毛主席著作的时间。在职工业余生活方面鼓吹“生产时间要紧张劳动，业余生活要轻松愉快”，什么“吃得好，睡得好，玩得好，工人生产才有劲头”。总之，在“以生产为中心，生产、生活、教育三位一体”的修正主义工运路线的毒害下，工会各个方面工作都要服从“生产”，抽掉了工人运动的革命灵魂，使工会脱离阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离无产阶级政治，走向修正主义道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”可是头号大叛徒、大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫公然对抗毛主席的指示，开口先进的生产技术，闭口先进的生产定额，就是不讲政治挂帅，不讲人的思想革命化。在中国赫鲁晓夫的黑指示下，长期以来，我局工会热中于搞一套“指标挂帅”、“技术挂帅”的生产竞赛，搬来了大量苏修的黑经验，抓实不抓虚，见物不见人。工人一针见血地批评说：“这个法，那个法，就是没有活学活用毛主席著作的好方法”，“这个经验，那个经验，就是没有如何突出政治的好经验”。十多年来，我局劳动竞赛五花八门，名目繁多，可是万变不离其宗，翻来复去就是比指标，赛定额。开展“五好”运动，也是贯彻中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的那一套“四好为一好”的黑货，胡说什么“生产好就是政治好”，什么“五好六好，只要完成任务不出事故就算好”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个大工贼大搞“生产工会”的罪恶目的，实际上就是以生产压革命，要我们工人埋头生产，不问政治，忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，听任他们这伙反革命修正主义分子搞“和平演变”，在中国复辟资本主义。他们的用心是多么阴险，手段是多么毒辣！我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，大破中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义工运路线，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，誓把工人阶级的革命群众组织办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
