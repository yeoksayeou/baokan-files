The People's Liberation Army Nanjing Military Region Air Force recently held a conference of representatives of active learners of Chairman Mao's works. Over the course of ten days, more than a thousand representatives held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's great achievements, and enthusiastically discussed the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. They summarized and exchanged their achievements and experiences in the past year of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Zhang Chunqiao, vice-director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and responsible person for the Nanjing Military Region, attended the closing ceremony and extended warm congratulations to the conference. Zhang Chunqiao spoke to the attendees, reporting on the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is inspiring to the heart. He encouraged the attendees to further play the role of active learners, actively respond to Comrade Lin Biao's great call, and push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

During the conference, the representatives studied word for word Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspection. They linked their own practices of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, enthusiastically discussed the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically discussed the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and enthusiastically discussed the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. They unanimously agreed that only by standing on the side of the public and using Mao Zedong Thought as a telescope and microscope to analyze the situation can one grasp the main trend, see the essence, recognize the direction, stand high, and stand firm, so that a typhoon of the twelfth level cannot blow one down. The representatives shouted a thousand times and ten thousand times, "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, not just a little good. The overall situation is better than ever before." They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the more they studied, the brighter their hearts became, the more they studied, the clearer their minds became, and the more they studied, the closer they felt to Chairman Mao. The representatives said, "We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, closely follow the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, constantly study new situations, new experiences, new trends, and new problems, constantly carry out 'criticize and repudiate oneself, criticize and repudiate revisionism,' and raise the thought revolutionization to a new height to achieve new merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement."

Everyone agreed that in the past year, the Nanjing Military Region Air Force, in implementing Comrade Lin Biao's instruction that studying Chairman Mao's works should focus on the word 'use,' created many experiences, which can be summarized in three words: The first is 'loyalty,' which means being forever loyal, infinitely loyal, and absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. This is the fundamental purpose and driving force of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The second is 'struggle,' which means studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle between the two lines, struggling with the class enemy and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and struggling with the 'self' in one's own mind. The third is 'use,' which means studying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the word 'use,' learning and applying, actively learning and applying, following the instructions sentence by sentence, and resolutely following them.

Jiang Tengjiao, responsible person for the Nanjing Military Region Air Force, made a summary report on the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, calling on everyone to thoroughly implement Comrade Lin Biao's instruction: "Study with questions in mind, actively learn and apply, combine learning with use, learn first what is urgently needed, see immediate results, and focus on the word 'use.'" Launch a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works that is on a larger scale, more in-depth, and more solid, hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, strengthen the thought revolutionization of the troops even more, raise combat effectiveness even higher, resolutely implement the great battle order of the great leader Chairman Mao, and achieve new merits in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement.

    张春桥同志出席了闭幕大会表示热烈祝贺并讲了话
    据新华社上海二十三日电　人民解放军南京部队空军最近召开了学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会。在历时十天的大会上，一千多名代表高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大学特学毛主席最新指示，大颂特颂毛主席的丰功伟绩，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的巨大威力，总结和交流了一年来活学活用毛主席著作的成绩和经验。
    中央文革小组副组长、南京部队负责人张春桥同志出席了闭幕大会，向大会表示热烈的祝贺。张春桥同志向到会代表讲了话，报告了鼓舞人心的无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，勉励到会代表，进一步发挥积极分子的骨干作用，积极响应林副主席的伟大号召，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动，推进到一个新的水平。
    会议期间，代表们逐字逐句地学习了毛主席视察时所作的重要指示，大家联系自己在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的实践，畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，畅谈毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，畅谈毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。一致认为只有站在“公”字上，用毛泽东思想这个望远镜和显微镜来分析形势，才能抓住主流，看清本质，认清方向，才能站得高，立得稳，十二级台风刮不倒。代表们千遍万遍地欢呼“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。”反复学习毛主席的最新指示，越学心里越亮堂，越学头脑越清醒，越学越感到毛主席亲，毛主席的话句句说到了我们的心坎里。代表们说：“我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧跟无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，要不断地研究新形势、新经验、新动向、新问题，不断地进行‘斗私，批修’，把思想革命化提高到新高度，为无产阶级文化大革命运动立新功。”
    大家认为，一年来，南京部队空军在贯彻林副主席学习毛主席著作要在“用”字上狠下功夫的指示中，创造了许多经验，集中起来就是三个字：一是“忠”字，就是永远忠于、无限忠于、绝对忠于伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想，这是活学活用毛主席著作的根本目的和动力。二是“斗”字，就是在两条路线斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，和阶级敌人、党内一小撮走资派斗，和自己头脑里的
  “私”字斗。三是“用”字，就是学习毛主席著作，要在“用”字上狠下功夫，学了就用，活学活用，句句照办，坚决照办。
    南京部队空军负责人江腾蛟作了开展活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的总结报告，号召大家切实贯彻执行林副主席的指示：“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”掀起一个规模更大、更深入、更扎实的活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高举更高举，把部队思想革命化加强更加强，战斗力提高再提高，坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席的伟大战斗号令，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
