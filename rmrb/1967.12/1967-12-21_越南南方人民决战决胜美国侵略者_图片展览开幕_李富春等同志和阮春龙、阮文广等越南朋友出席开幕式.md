The exhibition "The People of South Vietnam Decisively Defeat the U.S. Aggressors" opened this morning at the Beijing Exhibition Hall and was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses of the capital.

Li Fuchun, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, Vice Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army of China Wen Yuceng, and relevant officials Han Nianlong, Ding Xilin, and Niu Lianbi, as well as more than 500 soldiers and officers from the PLA's army, navy, and air force and revolutionary masses from the capital, attended the opening ceremony.

The delegation led by Nguyen Xuan Long, Nguyen Thi Chi, and San Luc, the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in China led by Nguyen Van Hieu and Nguyen Minh Phuong, the Counselor of the Vietnamese Embassy in China Le Cong Chi, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing were invited to attend the opening ceremony.

The Beijing Exhibition Hall today was filled with the atmosphere of the fighting unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam. The national flags of the two countries and the flag of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam were flying high at the entrance of the exhibition hall. On the curtain at the front of the hall hung the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, the portrait of the great leader of the Vietnamese people and the close comrade of the Chinese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and the portrait of Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The congratulatory telegram sent by our great helmsman Chairman Mao to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho on the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the statement issued by Chairman Mao on August 29, 1963, "Oppose the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem Clique's Aggression Against South Vietnam and the Massacre of the People of South Vietnam," were written in gold on the red screen in the hall. The walls of the hall were adorned with many boards of Chairman Mao's quotations and Chairman Ho Chi Minh's and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho's quotations.

The exhibition features more than 220 photographs. These photographs vividly and realistically introduce the plight of the U.S. imperialists in Vietnam, where they are on the defensive and at their wits' end; they reflect the glorious victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam under the leadership of the honorable banner of the people of South Vietnam—the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam—in the war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation; they show the firm resolve of the people of South Vietnam and North Vietnam to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country. Many photographs enthusiastically sing the praises of the fraternal friendship and fighting unity between the 700 million Chinese people and the Vietnamese people in their struggle against their common enemy—the U.S. imperialists.

The exhibition is organized by the China International Friendship Association and the China-Vietnam Friendship Association to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Envoys from various countries in China were also invited to attend.
