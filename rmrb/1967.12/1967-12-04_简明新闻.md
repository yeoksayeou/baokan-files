	General Strike in Penang, Malaysia
	On November 24, a general strike involving various industries erupted in Penang, a city in northern Malaysia, in protest against the decision by the Rahman clique, the lackeys of American and British imperialism, to devalue the old Malaysian currency in line with the pound, causing great losses to the Malaysian working people.

	As early as November 21 and 22, the people of Penang held consecutive demonstrations to protest the devaluation of the old Malaysian currency. However, the Rahman puppet clique dispatched police to suppress the demonstrators, resulting in many demonstrators being seriously injured. This further enraged the people, leading to the general strike in Penang on November 24.

	Soviet Revisionists Compromise Again on Fishing Issue
	On November 25, the Soviet revisionist leadership made new concessions to the U.S. imperialists on the fishing issue.

	According to an agreement signed by officials of the two countries in Moscow that day, the Soviet revisionists accepted the U.S. demand that Soviet fishing vessels not enter the specified fishing seasons in the North Atlantic public sea areas near the U.S. coast.

	Previously, the Soviet revisionists had also reached an agreement with the United States in July 1966 to make concessions on the fishing issue, stipulating that Soviet fishing vessels would not fish in certain fishing areas near the U.S. coast in the Pacific.
