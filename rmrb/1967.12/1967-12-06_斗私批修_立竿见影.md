We reviewed our struggle over the past year and deeply felt that: to study Chairman Mao Zedong's thought, we must first correct our attitude and link it to reality. Without correcting our attitude and linking it to reality, we cannot learn or apply it; by linking it to our own reality and the current revolutionary struggle, we can learn and see immediate results. The process of achieving revolutionary great unity between the two revolutionary mass organizations in our Zhabei District is a process of using the "arrow" of Mao Zedong thought to hit the "target" of current revolutionary practice, and a process of fiercely struggling against selfishness.

The revolutionary rebel workers of Zhabei District, with the victory of the "January Revolution," saw a significant change in their status. A few revolutionary leaders, failing to promptly use Chairman Mao's teachings to examine and spur themselves on, allowed "selfishness" to take over, thinking "only I am leftist, only I am revolutionary." As a result, the two revolutionary organizations that had long fought side by side—Gongzongsi Zhabei District Command and Gongzongsi Zhabei District Branch—attacked each other and engaged in a principle-less "internal war." This truly hurt the hearts of class brothers and made class enemies laugh.

At this critical juncture, comrades from the Zhabei District Military Sub-district, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "distinguish between enemies and ourselves and not stand in an antagonistic position to use the attitude of treating enemies to treat comrades," talked to the leaders of both organizations and sincerely pointed out: "Is this 'internal war' in the right direction? You must be revolutionaries who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao and forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought." Although the leaders of both sides were deeply moved by these heartfelt words at the time, because they took a pragmatic attitude towards Chairman Mao's instructions, interpreting them out of context and using them for their own purposes, they saw themselves as always correct and the other side as always wrong, and still could not come to an agreement.

Following this, the comrades from the Military Sub-district convened a three-day study session of Chairman Mao's works in early September, bringing together the leaders of both organizations. The three-day study session was a practical application session of the "Old Three Articles," a session of fierce self-criticism using the "Old Three Articles" as a weapon. We worked hard on putting what we learned into practice, learning a little and using a little, combining learning with practice, seeing immediate results, and constantly transforming ourselves.

Chairman Mao warmly taught us: "We all come from the lakes and seas, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together." Following Chairman Mao's teaching, we conducted a comparison and remembrance, greatly arousing class feelings. In the old society, we were exploited and oppressed by capitalists, we fought against capitalists, and we were class brothers who shared the same fate and breathed together, but why are we fighting an "internal war" now? Remembering when we first rose up to rebel, we had only one thought: to follow Chairman Mao closely and make the revolution. But now, Chairman Mao teaches us to achieve revolutionary great unity, why can't we unite?

The more we remembered, the more restless we became. Some comrades said, Comrade Zhang Zedong sacrificed his precious life for the revolutionary cause, Comrade Norman Bethune was a foreigner who sacrificed himself for China's revolutionary cause, compared to them, we are far behind. Where is the difference? It lies in the fact that we have a big rock of "selfishness" in our minds. We must use the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong to remove this "selfishness" and replace it with "publicness." Everyone actively applied Chairman Mao's works, armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and used the highest standard of Mao Zedong Thought to solve problems.

Why did we fight an "internal war" in the past? Everything has its roots. Everyone made a joint examination, and the root cause was "selfishness." "Selfishness" took the upper hand, thinking little about revolutionary interests and a lot about personal interests. We exposed the "enemy" in our minds and denounced the crimes of "selfishness." Everyone agreed: "Selfishness" is the source of all diseases, "selfishness" is the source of bourgeois thought and revisionism, and we must use Mao Zedong Thought, the strongest and sharpest weapon, to smash "selfishness" to pieces. Everyone took the "Old Three Articles" as a guide and conducted serious self-criticism.

The three-day session of actively applying Chairman Mao's works yielded rich fruits: our original two revolutionary mass organizations united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and established a new fighting collective—the Gongzongsi Zhabei Liaison Station. The process of our achieving revolutionary great unity made us further realize: we must strive to follow every word and instruction of Chairman Mao, deeply understand, link it to reality, and carry it out sentence by sentence. Actively applying Mao Zedong Thought and linking it to the current revolutionary practice can overcome any difficulty and remove any obstacle, achieving invincibility.

    斗私批修　立竿见影
    上海工人革命造反总司令部闸北联络站
    我们回顾了一年来的斗争历程，深深体会到：学习毛泽东思想，首先要端正态度，联系实际。不端正态度，不联系实际，就学不进，用不上；联系自己的实际，联系当前革命斗争的实际，就能学得进，就能立竿见影。我们闸北区两个工人革命群众组织实现革命大联合的过程，就是用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射当前革命斗争实践之“的”，狠斗私心的过程。
    我们闸北区的工人革命造反派，随着“一月革命”的胜利，地位起了显著的变化，少数革命派头头由于没有及时地用毛主席的教导来对照自己、鞭策自己，而是“私”字当了家，“唯我独左，唯我独革”。结果两个一直并肩作战的革命组织——工总司闸北区司令部和工总司闸北区分部，互相攻击，打起无原则的“内战”来了。这真是痛在阶级兄弟心里，笑在阶级敌人脸上。
    在这个重要关头，中国人民解放军闸北区武装部的同志，根据毛主席“要分清敌我，不能站在敌对的立场用对待敌人的态度来对待同志”的教导，找了两个组织的头头谈心，并诚恳地指出：“你们这样打‘内战’大方向对不对？你们要做永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想的革命派战士。”当时，双方头头对这些语重心长的话虽然感触很深，但是由于对毛主席的指示采取实用主义的态度，断章取义，各取所需，为自己服务，因而，看自己，处处正确，看对方，处处错误，还是谈不到一起。
    接着，武装部的同志在九月上旬把我们双方组织的头头召集在一起，开了三天的毛主席著作学习会。三天的学习会，是活学活用“老三篇”的讲用会，是以“老三篇”为武器的狠触灵魂的斗“私”会。我们在用字上狠下功夫，学一点就用一点，学用结合，立竿见影，不断地改造自己。
    毛主席亲切地教导我们：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”遵循毛主席的这个教导，我们进行了回忆对比，大大激发了阶级感情。在旧社会，我们受资本家的剥削压迫，我们与资本家进行斗争，都是同命运共呼吸的阶级兄弟，而现在为什么却打“内战”呢？回忆起我们刚起来革命造反时，只有一个心思，就是要紧跟毛主席干革命。但现在毛主席教导我们要实现革命的大联合，我们为什么还联合不起来呢？
    大家越回忆，越坐立不安。有的同志说，张思德同志为了革命的利益献出了自己的宝贵生命，白求恩同志是一个外国人，为中国的革命事业牺牲了自己，我们和他们相比，相差十万八千里。差距在哪里？就在我们脑子里有一块“私”字大石头。我们一定要用愚公移山的精神，挖掉这个“私”字，换上一个“公”字。大家活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，用毛泽东思想的最高标准去解决问题。
    过去为什么打“内战”？树有根，水有源。大家共同作了检查，归根结底是“私”字在作怪。“私”字占了上风，革命利益想得很少很少，个人利益想得很多很多。把头脑中的“敌人”揪了出来，大家控诉了“私”字的罪恶。大家一致认为：“私”字是百病之源，“私”字是资产阶级思想、修正主义的发源地，一定要用毛泽东思想这个最强大最锐利的武器，把“私”字砸个粉身碎骨。大家以“老三篇”为指南，认真进行了自我批评。
    三天活学活用毛主席著作的会议，结出了丰硕的果实：我们原来两个工人革命群众组织，在毛泽东思想的基础上，联合起来了，成立了新的战斗集体——工总司闸北联络站。我们实现革命大联合的过程，使我们进一步体会到：对毛主席的每句话，每个指示，都应该努力紧跟，深刻领会，联系实际，句句照办。活学活用毛泽东思想，和当前革命斗争实践相结合，就任何困难都能克服，任何障碍都能扫除，无往而不胜。
