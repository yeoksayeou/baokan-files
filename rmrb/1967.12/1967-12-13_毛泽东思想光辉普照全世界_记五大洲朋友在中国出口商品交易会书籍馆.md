The ongoing China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou features a bookstore within the China Export Commodities Exhibition Hall that has attracted a large number of foreign friends. Visitors to the bookstore have used the most beautiful language to enthusiastically praise our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They say that Chairman Mao is the "greatest genius of our time," the "most outstanding proletarian revolutionary," and the "great helmsman of the world revolution." They sing the praises of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, saying it is like a torch with boundless flames, illuminating the path forward for revolutionary people around the world.

Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the world revolution will definitely triumph

The bookstore displays Mao Zedong's works published in dozens of languages, as well as the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and precious photographs of Chairman Mao from various important historical periods of the revolution. The exhibition hall showcases various materials that demonstrate the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought, which is spreading rapidly and widely across the world on an unprecedented scale. Revolutionary people around the world are celebrating the arrival of a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner.

One day, a friend who had just arrived from Africa hurried to the bookstore at the fair. When the reporter met him, he had already been there for over three hours. This African friend is Hakka Hakki, the manager of the Revolutionary Bookstore in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Locals call him "Harakat" (Swahili for "the faster, the better"). According to Hakki, since the Revolutionary Bookstore in Zanzibar started supplying Chairman Mao's works and Mao badges, the demand has been increasing, often leading to shortages. People urge the bookstore to quickly and fully supply Mao's books and badges, often affectionately telling the manager, "We want Mao's books, Harakat!" This "Harakat" thus came to the fair with the heavy responsibility of the people of Zanzibar.

This African friend, with boundless love for Chairman Mao, introduced to the fair staff and reporters the story of the people of Zanzibar loving Chairman Mao. He said: In our country, people regard Chairman Mao as a great leader and China as the center of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought has educated the people of Zanzibar, and we all deeply respect and love Chairman Mao. The people of Zanzibar urgently need Chairman Mao's books, the faster the better!

"The wish of 'Harakat' was quickly fulfilled. He successfully signed a contract at the fair to purchase Chairman Mao's works and the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' He repeatedly expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people. He said: 'I hope China publishes more of Chairman Mao's works and the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' When the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, it will become a great material force. When the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will achieve complete liberation.' He also said: 'Through China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought is being grasped by people all over the world. This is a great contribution to the revolutionary people of the world in their struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Long live Chairman Mao!'"

"Supply various language versions of Chairman Mao's works to the world, the faster the better, the more the better!" In the bookstore at the fair, one often hears such feedback. A Japanese friend said that in a bookstore in Tokyo, Chairman Mao's works are the best-selling books. Because they often run out of stock, readers sometimes have to go several times to buy a copy of Chairman Mao's book. He said: 'Japanese revolutionary youth love Chairman Mao very much. Many young people carry the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' with them. Chinese comrades study the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' before work, and now Japanese youth are also studying in this way.' This Japanese friend said passionately: 'China is the base of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Our struggle is guided by the great Mao Zedong Thought. With the great Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, the world revolution will definitely triumph.'

Recently, the manager of the American Book Publishing Company in Mexico, Fuentes, came to China to participate in the National Day celebrations in Beijing and was received by the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. Recently, he came to the fair with the mission of the revolutionary people of Latin America, purchasing a large number of Chairman Mao's works. He told the fair staff: 'Revolutionary people around the world are eager to study Chairman Mao's works. We love the great leader and teacher Chairman Mao because he embodies the wisdom of all humanity and guides the people of all countries in their struggles.' This Latin American friend emphasized: 'Only by following Chairman Mao can the world achieve victory. Only by fighting according to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought can we make the world a new world without imperialism and exploitation.'

Chairman Mao is the red sun, illuminating the hearts of revolutionary people around the world

At the fair, one often sees groups of sailors from various countries visiting. They especially like to take photos with the giant portraits of Chairman Mao in various exhibition halls of the fair, holding Chairman Mao's works. The sailors say: 'Standing with Chairman Mao, the proletariat has boundless wisdom and strength!'

The greatest hope of sailors from various countries coming to the fair is to obtain a copy of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' published in their native language and a shiny Mao badge. Sailors from the Greek ship "Marianti" currently loading cargo at Guangzhou Port were visiting the bookstore at the fair. A sailor suddenly discovered a copy of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' in Arabic. He jumped for joy. This sailor from the United Arab Emirates had long hoped to obtain a copy of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' in Arabic, but he had searched many ports without success. When the fair staff handed him this red treasure, he excitedly wiped his hands on his clothes and then took the red treasure, pressing it tightly to his chest, repeatedly saying, "Thank you! Thank you so much!" Then, he eagerly opened the red treasure, flipping through the pages. He couldn't wait to find the passage he had heard many times on Beijing Radio: "All the people of the world, unite! Oppose the U.S. imperialist aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, unite! The people of the whole world should have courage to fight against their enemies, to dare to win victory, not to fear any sacrifice, and to persevere in spite of all difficulties and hardships. Then, the whole world will belong to the people. All the reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. It is people, not things, that determine the course of events. When we say the reactionaries are paper tigers, we do so in order to expose their weakness and to teach the people not to fear the strength of the enemy, and to muster their courage and wipe out all their enemies, however formidable these may appear to be." When he first saw this passage in Chairman Mao's book, he couldn't help but read it aloud and shouted in the Chinese he had just learned, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

This sailor from the United Arab Emirates told the reporter: "China is where the red sun rises, and the red sun is Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong Thought is like the sun's rays, illuminating our hearts. Revolutionary people around the world love Chairman Mao boundlessly." He also said: "In just over a decade, China's industrial and agricultural production has achieved such great achievements under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, which is something no other country in the world can achieve. China's strength is the happiness of revolutionary people around the world. Revolutionary people around the world deeply admire the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The oppressed people can only be liberated by relying on Mao Zedong Thought

Friends who are bravely fighting against imperialism and revisionism deeply feel that the oppressed people of the world want liberation, relying on Mao Zedong Thought. At the fair, many friends used the most beautiful language to express their boundless love and respect for the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist and the great leader of the world revolution, Chairman Mao. During their visit to Guangzhou, the delegation of the Albania-China Friendship Association visited the bookstore at the fair. The delegation leader, Sheh Peci, enthusiastically praised: "The oppressed people of the world want to break free from the shackles of slavery and strive for liberation, they must rely on Mao Zedong Thought. We not only want to establish Chairman Mao's prestige in China but also want to establish Chairman Mao's prestige in the world, because revolutionary people around the world love Chairman Mao." In the bookstore, a photo on a book tower with the words "Mao Zedong Thought Shines Brightly Across the World" attracted the attention of the Albanian comrades. This photo shows the enthusiastic scene of the Albanian people buying the newly published Albanian version of Chairman Mao's works. Sheh Peci happily said that the photo was well-taken and very realistic. The Albanian people regard Chairman Mao's works as their indispensable spiritual food. The entire nation is studying the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought.

A group of Vietnamese youth repeatedly watched Chairman Mao's photos and various Chairman Mao's works in the bookstore. Chairman Mao's brilliant works and his great thoughts inspire the heroic Vietnamese people. Every Vietnamese version of Chairman Mao's works and every picture related to the struggle of the Vietnamese people exhibited in the bookstore at the fair make these Vietnamese friends feel very familiar. They enthusiastically discussed in the bookstore: Here, the picture shows two young female guerrillas sitting on hammocks in dense forests, engrossed in reading Chairman Mao's works. Some said the book the female guerrillas were holding was the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' and some said it was the "Three Articles." A youth who grew up in South Vietnam confidently said: That must be Chairman Mao's military works. He introduced to his companions: "The military in South Vietnam love to read Chairman Mao's military works. The liberated areas in South Vietnam have translated and published a selection of Chairman Mao's military works. The armed forces of the South Vietnamese people's armed forces carry this treasure like a weapon and use it as a textbook for learning. The people's war thought of Chairman Mao has deeply entered the hearts of the people in South Vietnam."

Chairman Mao, the revolutionary people of the world wish you eternal life!

The bookstore exhibits many letters from foreign friends. These letters are songs of praise from foreign friends who have not met Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people. Among these batches of reader letters, some are sent from the white terror of the reactionaries, and many are sent from the center of imperialist reactionary rule—the United States. Many American friends' letters are about their joy of obtaining Chairman Mao's works, discussing their experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works, and more readers express their boundless love and respect for the greatest genius of our time, the outstanding leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

An American friend wrote in a letter: "I really hope to get the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' so that I can study Mao Zedong Thought well and follow this great leader and teacher to dedicate myself to the movement he leads to make the world a world belonging to the people. For the sake of obtaining a copy of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I am willing to pay any price."

Another American youth expressed his boundless love and admiration for the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, with passionate verses: It is you, our commander, who gathers the ideals, wisdom, and strength of the masses into a vigorous ocean, ... It is you, our incomparable teacher, who points out the correct direction for us to change the world, valleys, plains, mountains, and oceans will forever sing in praise of you. Long live Chairman Mao! Wish you eternal life!

　　毛泽东思想光辉普照全世界
　　——记五大洲朋友在中国出口商品交易会书籍馆
    正在广州举行的中国出口商品交易会上，中国出口商品陈列馆的书籍馆，吸引了大批外国朋友的注意。参观过书籍馆的各国朋友，用最美好的语言热情称颂我们伟大领袖毛主席，称颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们说，毛主席是“当代最伟大的天才”，“最杰出的无产阶级革命家”，是“世界革命的伟大舵手”。他们歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想“象光焰无际的火炬，照亮了全世界革命人民前进的道路”。
　　用毛泽东思想作指导，世界革命就一定胜利
    在书籍馆里，陈列着用几十种文字出版的毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》，以及毛主席在各个重要革命历史时期的珍贵照片。这个展览馆里展出的各种资料说明，毛泽东思想的伟大真理，正以空前的规模在全世界迅速广泛地传播。世界革命人民都在欢呼全世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。
    一天，一位刚从非洲来的朋友匆匆赶到交易会书籍馆。记者遇见他的时候，他已经在那里参观了三个多钟头。这位非洲朋友是坦桑尼亚共和国桑给巴尔革命书店的经理哈卡·哈基。当地人民都把他的名字叫做“哈拉卡蒂（斯瓦希里语：越快越好）”。据哈基说，自从桑给巴尔革命书店开始供应毛主席著作和毛主席像章以来，购买的人越来越多，经常出现供不应求的情况。人们要求这家书店能尽快充分地向他们供应毛主席的书和毛主席像章，总是亲切地对书店经理说：“要毛主席的书，哈拉卡蒂！”这位“哈拉卡蒂”就是这样带着桑给巴尔人民的重托来到交易会的。
    这位非洲朋友怀着对毛主席无限热爱的感情，向交易会工作人员和记者介绍了桑给巴尔人民热爱毛主席的故事。他说：在我们的国家里，人们都把毛主席作为伟大的领袖，把中国作为世界革命的中心。毛泽东思想教育了桑给巴尔人民，我们都无限崇敬和热爱毛主席。桑给巴尔人民要求得到毛主席的书，越快越好！
      “哈拉卡蒂”的愿望很快得到了实现，他在交易会上顺利地签定了订购毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》的合同，他一再地向中国人民表示感谢。他说：“我希望中国出版更多的毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》，人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就会化为巨大的物质力量。亚非拉人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就会取得彻底的解放。”他还说：“经过中国的无产阶级文化大革命，毛泽东思想正在为全世界人民所掌握，这对全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，是一个伟大的贡献。祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！”
    向世界各地供应各种文版的毛主席著作，越快越好，越多越好！在交易会书籍馆里，人们经常能听到这样的反映。一位日本朋友说，在东京的一家书店里，毛主席著作是最畅销的书。因为经常脱销，读者要买到一本毛主席的书，有时要跑好几次。他说：“日本的革命青年非常热爱毛主席，许多青年都随身带着《毛主席语录》。中国同志在工作之前都学习毛主席语录，现在日本青年也这样学习。”这位日本朋友热情洋溢地说：“中国是世界革命的根据地。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，我们的斗争是用毛泽东思想来指导的。用伟大的毛泽东思想作指导，世界革命就一定胜利。”
    墨西哥美洲书刊发行社经理福恩特斯，不久前来到中国，在北京参加国庆观礼，受到了世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的接见。最近，他带着拉丁美洲革命人民的嘱托，前来参加交易会，订购了大批毛主席著作。他对交易会工作人员说：“世界革命人民都迫切要求学习毛主席著作。我们热爱伟大领袖、伟大导师毛主席，因为他体现了全人类的智慧，他指引着世界各国人民进行斗争。”这位拉丁美洲朋友强调说：“只有跟着毛主席，全世界才能取得胜利。只有按照战无不胜的毛泽东思想去进行斗争，才能使全世界变成没有帝国主义、没有剥削的新世界。”
　　毛主席是红太阳，照亮了世界革命人民的心
    在交易会上，经常可以见到一批一批来自世界各地的海员在参观。他们最喜欢在交易会各个陈列大厅的巨幅毛主席画像前，手持毛主席著作拍照留念。海员们说：“和毛主席站在一起，无产阶级就有无穷的智慧和力量！”
    各国海员到交易会来最大的希望，是能够得到一本用本国语文出版的《毛主席语录》和一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章。正在广州港装卸货物的希腊货轮“玛丽安蒂”号的海员们，在交易会书籍馆参观的时候，一位海员忽然发现了一本阿拉伯文版的《毛主席语录》，他高兴得跳了起来。这位阿联籍海员很早就希望获得一本阿拉伯文版的《毛主席语录》，可是跑了许多港口都没有买到。当交易会工作人员递给他这本红色宝书的时候，他激动地把双手在自己的衣服上揩了又揩，然后接过这本红宝书，紧紧地贴在胸前，连声说：“谢谢！太感谢你们了！”接着，他如饥似渴地打开红宝书，一页页地翻起来，他迫不及待地想找到那段他早在北京电台的广播里反复听到过的毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”当他第一次在毛主席的书上看到这段语录，就情不自禁地朗读起来，并用刚学会的中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    这位阿联籍海员对记者说：“中国是红太阳升起的地方，红太阳就是毛泽东！毛泽东思想象太阳的光辉，照亮了我们的心。全世界革命人民都无限热爱毛主席。”他还说：“在短短的十几年里，中国的工农业生产在毛主席的英明领导下，取得如此伟大的成就，这是世界上任何国家都难以取得的。中国的强大，就是全世界革命人民的幸福。全世界革命人民都无限敬仰伟大领袖毛主席！”
　　被压迫人民只有靠毛泽东思想才能得解放
    正在英勇地进行反帝反修斗争的各国战友，深深地体会到：全世界被压迫人民要解放，靠的是毛泽东思想。在交易会上，许多朋友用最美好的语言来表达他们对当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、世界革命的伟大导师毛主席的无比热爱、无比崇敬的心情。阿中友协代表团访问广州期间参观了交易会书籍馆。团长谢·佩奇热情洋溢地赞扬说：“世界被压迫人民要摆脱奴隶枷锁，争取解放，就要靠毛泽东思想。我们不只要在中国树立毛主席的威信，而且要在全世界树立毛主席的威信，因为全世界革命人民都热爱毛主席。”在书籍馆一个写着“毛泽东思想光辉普照全世界”的书塔上，一幅照片吸引了阿尔巴尼亚同志，这幅照片拍的是阿尔巴尼亚群众踊跃购买刚刚出版的阿尔巴尼亚文的毛主席著作的情景。谢·佩奇同志高兴地说，拍得很好，很真实，阿尔巴尼亚人民把毛主席著作看作是自己不可缺少的精神食粮。全国人民都在学习当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。
    一批越南青年在书籍馆一遍又一遍地观看毛主席的照片和各种毛主席著作。毛主席的光辉著作和他的伟大思想，鼓舞着英雄的越南人民。交易会书籍馆里陈列的每一种越南文版的毛主席著作，每一张有关越南人民斗争事迹的图片，都使这些越南青年朋友感到无比亲切。他们在书籍馆里热烈地谈论起来：这里展出的图片上，有两个年轻的女游击队战士，坐在茂密的丛林中的吊床上，在埋头阅读毛主席著作。有的说女游击队员手捧的书是《毛主席语录》，有的说是“老三篇”。一位在越南南方长大的青年满有把握地说：那一定是毛主席的军事著作。他向同伴们介绍说：“越南南方军民最爱读毛主席的军事著作，南方解放区翻译出版了毛主席的军事著作选编，南方人民武装部队指战员把这本宝书象武器一样携带在身边，把它作为学习的教材。毛主席的人民战争思想在越南南方已经深入人心。”
　　毛主席啊，世界革命人民敬祝您万寿无疆！
    书籍馆里展出了许多外国朋友的来信。这些来信，是一些没有见面的外国朋友对世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席的赞歌。在这大批读者来信中，有些是从反动派白色恐怖的环境中寄来的，还有许多是从帝国主义反动统治的中心——美国寄来的。许多美国朋友的来信，有的是向中国朋友倾诉他们获得毛主席著作的喜悦心情，有的是谈他们学习毛主席著作的心得体会，更多的读者抒发了他们对当代最伟大的天才、世界革命人民的杰出领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限崇敬的感情。
    一位美国朋友在信上说：“我非常希望得到《毛主席语录》这本红书，以便能够好好地学习毛泽东思想，跟随这位伟大领袖和导师，献身于他所领导的把世界变为一个属于人民的世界的运动。为了获得一本《毛主席语录》，我可以付出任何代价。”
    另一位美国青年以热情洋溢的诗句，表达了他对世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席无限热爱、无限敬仰的感情：是您，我们的统帅，把群众的理想、智慧和力量，汇集成生气蓬勃的海洋，……是您，我们无可比拟的导师，为我们改造世界，指出了正确的方向，溪谷、原野、群山、海洋，将永远为赞颂您而歌唱。万岁，毛主席！祝您万寿无疆！　新华社记者（附图片）
