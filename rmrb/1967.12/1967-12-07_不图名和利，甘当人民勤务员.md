Selflessly Serving the People

Model Soldier Han Maoxiu

Chinese Khrushchev is a "windhead fanatic." He spouts nonsense about how "If you work hard at this job for a long time, you will eventually get the credit." Without much explanation, it is clear that the hard work Chinese Khrushchev talks about is ultimately for the sake of gaining fame. Here, he vigorously promotes the extreme individualism of the bourgeoisie.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long criticized windheadism, pointing out: "...windheadism and the like are the most despicable; while the spirit of selflessness, active effort, self-sacrifice, and hard work is what is truly respectable." Chairman Mao's teachings inspire us revolutionary people to actively and consciously transform our thoughts, achieving one victory after another. Look, heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and countless others, work diligently for the Party and the people, seeking neither fame nor wealth, fearing neither hardship nor death. They are the representatives of selfless communist heroes.

The motivation behind any work determines its outcome. Working selflessly and steadfastly for a long time can promote the early realization of communism. Following Chinese Khrushchev's path of seeking fame, wealth, and credit will only lead one further away from the path of Mao Zedong Thought, causing greater harm to the revolutionary cause.

On this issue, I have some personal experience. I am an old soldier who enlisted in 1960. Over the past eight years, under the cultivation and education of Chairman Mao and the Party, I have gradually cultivated a selfless spirit and decided to be a good ordinary soldier. However, sometimes I hear such remarks: "Having served for so long, it's time for a promotion." Facing such remarks, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army it leads are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, working wholeheartedly for the people's interests." He also said: "Communist Party members should never put personal interests first, but should always subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." I thought, as a Communist Party member and a servant of the people, I should unconditionally obey the Party and the people's needs to be a platoon leader and serve beyond my term. Those who spread such remarks have been poisoned by Chinese Khrushchev's toxins.

If one only does things that bring fame and avoids those that do not, who will lead the new soldiers? How can our people's army become more solid and powerful?

Thinking further, I realized that Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "fame" is a great trick. He wants us to focus on our work, ignore politics, and strive for fame, wealth, and credit. Once these bourgeois individualistic demands are not met, one will become discouraged, pessimistic, or even blame the organization and attack the leadership. This way, one falls into Chinese Khrushchev's trap, being led by the nose into the dark alley of capitalism. Look, how sinister Chinese Khrushchev's intentions are! But revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never be fooled.

Now, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the battle cry to "criticize and repudiate revisionism." We must launch a "white-knife battle" to eliminate the "self" from our minds and clear out the toxins spread by Chinese Khrushchev.

Editor's Note: In the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, the 6037 Unit, which has established new merits, has responded most resolutely and swiftly to Chairman Mao's call to criticize and repudiate revisionism. The soldiers and officers use Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to fiercely criticize the "self" in their minds and strongly repudiate Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary and decadent bourgeois worldview.

Criticizing revisionism requires criticizing the "self." The soldiers and officers of the 6037 Unit say well: The "self" is the object of revolution. To promote communism, one must eliminate capitalism; to be selfless, one must eliminate the "self." Without criticizing the "self," one cannot repudiate revisionism and may even become a revisionist. Only by criticizing the "self" can one thoroughly repudiate revisionism, achieve ideological revolutionization, and cultivate oneself into a successor of the communist cause.

The People's Liberation Army is a great army personally created and led by Chairman Mao, and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. At Chairman Mao's command, they charge onto the battlefield of criticizing the "self" and repudiating revisionism, using the "Three Articles" as their motto, and launching a "white-knife battle" against the "self" in their minds. All revolutionary masses across the country should learn from the great People's Liberation Army, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, combine learning with application, and see immediate results. In the battle of criticizing the "self" and repudiating revisionism, they should be pioneers, becoming true revolutionaries who are determined to carry the cultural revolution of the proletariat to the end.

    不图名和利，甘当人民勤务员
    五好战士　韩茂秀
    中国赫鲁晓夫是一个“风头迷”。他满嘴喷粪地胡说什么：“安心作这工作，长期的坚决的作这工作，最后出风头的还是你们。”不用多加说明，就可以看出中国赫鲁晓夫所说的安心工作，最终是为了出风头。在这里，他拚命地宣扬资产阶级的极端个人主义思想。
    我们伟大统帅毛主席早就对风头主义痛加批判，他指出：“……风头主义等等，是最可鄙的；而大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干的精神，才是可尊敬的。”毛主席的这一教导，鼓舞着我们革命人民积极自觉地改造自己的思想，取得了一个个的胜利。看，雷锋、王杰、刘英俊等等无数英雄人物，为党和人民兢兢业业地工作，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死。他们是“一心为公”的无产阶级英雄模范的代表。
    干任何工作，不同的动机有不同的效果。一心为公，长期、安心地去干，就能促进共产主义的早日实现。按照中国赫鲁晓夫为名、为利、为出风头而拚命地去干，越干离毛泽东思想的轨道越远，对革命事业的损失越大。
    在这个问题上，我是有体会的。我是一九六○年入伍的老战士，八年来，在毛主席和党的培养教育下，在我心灵里逐步培养起一心为公的思想，决心当好普通一兵。但是，有时也听到这样一种议论：“当了这么长时间的兵，也该提拔提拔了”。面对这样的议论，我学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”又说：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”我想到自己是个共产党员，是人民的勤务员。我当班长和超期服役是党和人民的需要，我应当无条件地服从。发出前面那种议论的同志，是中了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的毒素。
    如果说“出风头”的事就干，不“出风头”的事就不干，老战士超期服役没有风头出，就不干，那么，谁来带领新战士呢？我们的人民军队怎么能更加巩固、强大呢？
    进一步想一想，原来中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬“出风头”是个大毒计。他要我们埋头业务，不问政治，拚命为名、为利、为出风头而卖力。一旦这些资产阶级个人主义的要求实现不了，就会垂头丧气、悲观失望，或伸腿不干、消极怠工，甚至埋怨组织，攻击领导。这样就正中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒计，被他牵着鼻子，往资本主义黑胡同里跑。看，中国赫鲁晓夫的用心多么恶毒！但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士决不会上当。
    现在，伟大领袖毛主席发出了“斗私，批修”的战斗号令，我们一定要展开一场歼灭“私”字的“白刃战”，在我们头脑里肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的流毒。
    编者按　在“三支”“两军”工作中建立了新功勋的六○三七部队，最坚决、最迅速地响应了毛主席要斗私，批修的战斗号令。指战员们以毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗自己头脑里的
  “私”字，猛批中国赫鲁晓夫反动腐朽的资产阶级世界观。
    批修必须斗私。六○三七部队的指战员们说得好：“私”字是革命的对象，兴无必须灭资，为公必须铲私。不斗私不能反修，反而可能变修。只有斗私，才能彻底地批修、反修，实现思想革命化，把自己培养成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    中国人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导，林副主席亲自指挥的伟大的人民军队，毛主席一声令下，他们就杀上“斗私，批修”的战场，以“老三篇”做为座右铭，对头脑里的“私”字展开“白刃战”。全国的无产阶级革命派都要学习伟大的解放军，活学活用毛主席著作，学用结合，立竿见影，在斗私批修的战斗中当闯将，做一个真正决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
