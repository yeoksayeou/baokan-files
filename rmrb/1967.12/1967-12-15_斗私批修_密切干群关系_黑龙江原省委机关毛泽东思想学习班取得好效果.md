In the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the former provincial committee of Heilongjiang, revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, with boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and with the firm conviction of being eternally loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have been studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works together, opening their hearts to each other, working together, undergoing military training in formation, and engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. They have learned from each other, made up for each other's shortcomings, and further communicated their thoughts, greatly strengthening their mutual relationships.

At the beginning of the study class, everyone was organized to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "resolving the problem of superior-subordinate relationships well and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses" and his related discussions on correctly handling cadre issues. They also held multiple discussions. Everyone expressed that the instructions of the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao are the highest guidelines for our actions, and we must follow them to the letter. We must take "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, improve superior-subordinate relationships, cadre-mass relationships, and relationships between old and new cadres, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao said that conducting heart-to-heart talks is a very good method. The study class followed Chairman Mao's teachings and extensively carried out heart-to-heart talks. Everyone opened their hearts, sincerely met each other, took "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, examined themselves, exchanged opinions, and helped each other improve their understanding. When encountering disagreements or misunderstandings, they would bring the problems to Chairman Mao's works for guidance, learning while talking and talking while learning. The more they studied and talked, the more comfortable they felt, the deeper their love for Chairman Mao grew, the more profound their understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line became, and the more enthusiastic they were about struggling against self and criticizing revisionism. The study class was filled with a atmosphere of unity, democracy, and self-criticism.

Through in-depth study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related discussions, through extensive discussions on the great situation and significance of the Cultural Revolution, through heart-to-heart talks, and through visits to the working-class and peasant masses, the revolutionary cadres' understanding significantly improved. They deeply realized that "the masses are the real heroes" and expressed their determination to always place themselves among the masses and under the masses' supervision, always believe in the masses and rely on the masses, and always be students of the masses.

The revolutionary cadres participating in the study class, with their improved understanding, also underwent profound changes in their thoughts and emotions. Some revolutionary cadres, who had previously resisted the masses' enthusiastic help and criticism, now felt grateful and saw the revolutionary masses as their beloved teachers and friends. Some cadres who had been criticized by the masses also had their mental knots untied. Many cadres actively went to the masses, sincerely opened their hearts to those who had the most opinions about them, and eliminated misunderstandings. Through the study, revolutionary cadres deeply felt that the attitude towards the masses was essentially an attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, an attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, and a fundamental issue of stance and worldview. Cadres who had made mistakes all expressed their determination to learn from past lessons, consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview, and accelerate the revolutionization of their thoughts.

　　斗私批修  密切干群关系
    黑龙江原省委机关毛泽东思想学习班取得好效果
    据新华社哈尔滨十三日电　在黑龙江省原省委机关毛泽东思想学习班学习的革命领导干部和革命群众组织负责人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，怀着永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的坚定信念，一起学习毛主席的光辉著作，一起敞开思想谈心，一起劳动，一起列队军训，一起斗私批修，互相学习，取长补短，进一步沟通思想，大大密切了相互间的关系。
    学习班开始的时候，就组织大家逐字逐句反复学习毛主席关于“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系”的最新指示和有关正确对待干部问题的论述，并且进行了多次的座谈讨论。大家纷纷表示，最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的指示就是我们行动的最高纲领，必须字字照办，一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，搞好上下级关系、干群关系和新老干部关系，把文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席说，开展谈心活动，这个方法很好。学习班遵照毛主席的教导，广泛开展了谈心活动。大家敞开思想，真诚相见，以“斗私，批修”为纲，检查自己，互相交换意见，互相帮助提高认识。遇到有争执或不理解的问题，就带着问题共同向毛主席著作请教，在谈中学，在学中谈。大家越学越谈心情越舒畅，越学越谈对毛主席的热爱越深厚，越学越谈对毛主席的革命路线的理解越深刻，越学越谈斗私批修的劲头就越足。学习班出现了一片团结的气氛，民主的气氛，自我批评的气氛。
    在学习班里，经过深入学习毛主席最新指示和有关论述，经过大讲文化大革命的大好形势和伟大意义，经过谈心，经过访问工农群众，革命领导干部的认识显著提高。他们深刻地认识到：“群众是真正的英雄”，表示一定要永远把自己摆在群众之中，摆在群众的监督之下，永远相信群众，依靠群众，永远做群众的小学生。
    参加学习班的革命领导干部，随着认识的提高，思想感情也发生了深刻的变化。有些革命领导干部，对群众的热情帮助和批判，由抵触变为感激，从心眼里感到革命派可亲可爱，是自己的良师益友。有些曾经受到群众批判的领导干部，思想上的疙瘩也解开了。许多领导干部主动到群众里面去，和对自己意见最多的同志诚恳交心，消除了隔阂。革命领导干部经过学习，深刻地体会到，对群众的态度问题，实质上是对毛主席革命路线的态度问题，是对毛泽东思想的态度问题，是根本立场和世界观的问题。犯过错误的干部纷纷表示，一定要吸取过去的教训，自觉地用毛泽东思想来改造自己的世界观，加速思想革命化。
