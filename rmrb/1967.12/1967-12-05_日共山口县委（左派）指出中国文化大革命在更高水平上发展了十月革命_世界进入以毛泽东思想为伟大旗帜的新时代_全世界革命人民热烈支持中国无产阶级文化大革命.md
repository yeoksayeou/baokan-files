According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: A spokesperson for the leftist faction of the Japanese Communist Party's Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee issued a statement on the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, stating: The October Revolution opened up broad possibilities and a realistic path for the liberation of the world's peoples, established a united front of revolution for the world's proletariat and oppressed nations, and ushered in a new era of revolution for oppressed nations to strive for liberation. The Chinese Cultural Revolution, led by the proletariat, has inherited and developed the October Revolution to a higher level.

The spokesperson said: "The victory of the October Revolution, the victory of the anti-fascist war, and the victory of the Chinese Revolution have brought about a fundamental transformation in human society, opening up a great era where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory." However, after the death of Stalin, the labor aristocrats Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and other counter-revolutionary revisionists usurped the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state founded by Lenin and Stalin, turning the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into a revisionist party. In socialist Soviet Union, capitalism has been fully restored. The proletarian dictatorship established by the October Revolution has changed color and become a bourgeois dictatorship ruled by the Soviet privileged class of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others.

The spokesperson said: "Comrade Mao Zedong systematically summarized the historical lessons of the proletarian dictatorship, conducted a scientific analysis, elucidated the laws of class struggle, personally initiated and led the Cultural Revolution, prevented socialist China from changing color, and further consolidated the proletarian dictatorship. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, 700 million Chinese people are full of vigor and have launched an unprecedented Cultural Revolution with the momentum of a storm."

The spokesperson emphasized: The Chinese Cultural Revolution has inherited and developed the October Revolution led by Lenin and Stalin to a higher level. The capitalist roaders in power, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, have been overthrown, and the bourgeois headquarters attempting to restore capitalism has been smashed. The spokesperson said: The Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China, led by the most outstanding Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong, have become the bastion of world revolution. Now, the base of world revolution has shifted from the Soviet Union, which has changed color due to counter-revolutionary revisionism, to the great China led by Comrade Mao Zedong.

The spokesperson said: "The victory of the Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong has brought the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—to the world and established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Today, revolutionary people around the world regard the Chinese Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong Thought as the greatest guarantee of their liberation, and they have deep sympathy and enthusiastic support for the Cultural Revolution."

The spokesperson said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the world revolution. The world has entered an era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The powerful global revolutionary united front, with socialist China as its core, has surrounded and isolated American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique, and reactionaries from various countries. Japanese Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people will definitely smash the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique, which has degenerated into a lackey of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Soviet revisionist leadership, and lead the Japanese revolution, as part of the world revolution, to victory."

The spokesperson concluded with the slogans: "Advance along the great path of the October Socialist Revolution!" "Long live the continuation and development of the October Revolution—the Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought, the guiding ideology of the world revolution!" "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao Zedong!"

    日共山口县委（左派）指出中国文化大革命在更高水平上发展了十月革命
    世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代
    全世界革命人民热烈支持中国无产阶级文化大革命
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）发言人就十月社会主义革命五十周年发表谈话指出：十月革命为世界人民的解放事业开辟了广阔的可能性和现实的道路，建立起世界无产阶级和被压迫民族的革命的统一战线，开辟了被压迫民族争取解放的革命的新时代；而中国无产阶级文化大革命是在更高的水平上继承和发展了十月革命。
    发言人说：“十月革命的胜利，反法西斯战争的胜利和中国革命的胜利，带来了人类社会历史的根本转变，开辟了帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的大好时代。”但是，斯大林逝世以后，工人贵族赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金等反革命修正主义分子篡夺了列宁和斯大林所缔造的苏联共产党和苏维埃国家的领导权，把苏联共产党变成了一个修正主义的党；在社会主义苏联，资本主义已经全面地复辟，十月革命所建立起来的无产阶级专政的国家现在已经改变颜色，变成了勃列日涅夫、柯西金等苏联特权阶层统治的资产阶级专政的国家。
    发言人说：“伟大的毛泽东同志系统地总结了无产阶级专政的这种历史教训，作了科学的分析，阐明了阶级斗争的规律，亲自发动和领导无产阶级文化大革命，防止社会主义中国变色，进一步地巩固了无产阶级专政。七亿中国人民在伟大的毛泽东同志的领导下，意气风发，以急风暴雨之势，展开了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。”
    发言人强调指出：中国无产阶级文化大革命是在更高水平上继承和发展了列宁和斯大林所领导的十月革命。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派已经被打倒，企图复辟资本主义的资产阶级司令部已经被粉碎。发言人说：当代最卓越的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志所领导的中国共产党和中华人民共和国已经成了世界革命的堡垒。现在，世界革命的根据地已经从被反革命修正主义者改变了颜色的苏联转移到了伟大的毛泽东同志领导的中国。
    发言人说：“毛泽东同志亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，给全世界送来了当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想，并树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。今天，全世界的革命人民认为中国无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东思想是自己解放的最大保证，他们对无产阶级文化大革命寄予深切的同情和热烈的支持。”
    发言人说：“毛泽东思想是世界革命的指导思想。世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的时代。以社会主义中国为核心的全世界强大的革命统一战线，包围了美帝国主义、苏联修正主义、日共宫本修正主义集团和各国反动派，把它们孤立起来了。日本的马克思列宁主义者和广大革命人民，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，一定会粉碎已经堕落成为美日反动派和苏联修正主义领导集团的走狗的日共宫本修正主义集团，把作为世界革命的一部分的日本革命引向胜利。”
    发言人最后高呼：“沿着伟大十月社会主义革命的道路前进！”“十月革命的继续发展——无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“世界革命的指导思想——伟大的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛泽东主席万岁！”
