The revolutionary workers of the Dongfanghong Coal Mine in Zaozhuang, Shandong, have increased their enthusiasm and completed the production plan for November ahead of schedule and over quota, setting a new daily production record since 1960.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on December 2, the proletarian revolutionary faction and the revolutionary workers of the Dongfanghong Coal Mine under the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Jinan, have been actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have channelled the surging enthusiasm unleashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, completing the November production plan five days ahead of schedule and over quota.

Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party have incited some misled masses to leave their production posts, attempting to sabotage production. The proletarian revolutionary faction saw through the plot of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, insisting on making revolution on the spot and in their spare time. They united with the broad revolutionary workers to smash the enemy's plot. With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine, the entire mine launched a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, correctly handled the misled masses, and enthusiastically helped them quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The revolutionary ranks rapidly expanded. Now, more than 84% of the workers have joined revolutionary mass organizations. Everyone's hearts and efforts are united, making the revolution roar and production boil.

The proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses of the Dongfanghong Coal Mine resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, daring to liberate and use revolutionary cadres. After the revolutionary leading cadres came forward, they played a key and core role in production.

The proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the Dongfanghong Coal Mine resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call, launching a high tide of criticizing and repudiating revisionism, greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the people, and everyone is full of enthusiasm. The Zouwu Well is a thin coal seam, previously producing only 100 tons of coal per day, now leaping to 400 tons per day. This mine set a new daily production record in November since 1960.

    东方红煤矿的革命派和革命群众坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，大胆解放和使用革命干部。革命领导干部站出来之后，在生产中发挥了骨干作用和核心作用。
    东方红煤矿的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众、革命干部，坚决响应毛主席的号召，掀起了斗私批修的高潮，大大促进了人的思想革命化，人人干劲十足。邹坞井是个薄煤层，过去日产煤只有一百吨，现在一跃日产为四百吨。这个矿十一月份创造了一九六○年以来的日产最高纪录。
