Currently, some units are seeing a resurgence of the trend of wasteful spending at year's end. The leaders of these units mistakenly believe that they hold the financial reins and that things that were not done in the past should be done now. They do not consider whether things are necessary, do not hesitate to stockpile and waste, expand non-productive expenditures, engage in large-scale repairs, purchase large quantities of office supplies, and print various items. In short, they want to spend all the money and use it up. For example, one unit needs to buy a few thermoses. Someone suggests buying bamboo-shell thermoses to save money, while someone else says, "Why be so stingy? We should be more generous, buy colorful ones with flowers, which are both beautiful and generous, costing only seven or eight yuan each."

We believe that in order to save, one must be "stingy." This kind of "stinginess" is very good and should be greatly promoted. The "generosity" of showing off and flaunting wealth is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, and this kind of "generosity" must be resolutely opposed and resisted.

Chairman Mao said, "Every place must cherish manpower and material resources, and must not only consider the present and waste recklessly." We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, proceed from the principle of thrift, and resolutely stop the trend of wasteful spending at year's end.

　　坚决刹住年终乱花钱的歪风
    目前，有一些单位，年终乱花钱的歪风有所抬头。这些单位的负责人错误地认为，自己掌握着财政大权，过去没办的事现在该办了，因而不考虑需要与否，不惜积压浪费，扩大非生产性开支，大搞维修，大买办公用品，印这印那。总之，是想把钱花光用净了事。例如有个单位需要买几个热水瓶，有人主张买竹壳的，节约开支，有人则说：“何必那么小气，要大方些，买彩色带花的，既美观又大方，一个才七八块钱。”
    我们认为，为了节约就是要“小气”，这种“小气”好得很，要大大发扬；讲排场、摆阔气的“大方”，是资产阶级思想的表现，这种“大方”要坚决反对，坚决抵制。
    毛主席说：“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。”我们要牢记毛主席的教导，从节约原则出发，坚决刹住年终乱花钱的歪风。
