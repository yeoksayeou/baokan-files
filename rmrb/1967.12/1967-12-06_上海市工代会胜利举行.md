Under the warm care of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, the Shanghai Workers' Congress was successfully held. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao read a congratulatory telegram from the Central Cultural Revolution Group and delivered an important speech. The meeting called on all revolutionary workers in the city to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to build the Shanghai working class into a force armed with Mao Zedong Thought, always full of vigor, rich in revolutionary fighting spirit, and a strong revolutionary force.

Editor's Note: The Shanghai working class, which has made brilliant contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is a strong force in China's working class. The successful convening of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebellion Representatives Congress marks that the revolutionary workers' movement in Shanghai, under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought and guided by Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, has entered a new stage and reached a higher level.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The working class is the leading force and mainstay of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction. The working class not only needs to carry the socialist revolution to the end but also to support the world revolution, liberate all mankind, and achieve communism worldwide. To accomplish this great historical mission, the working class must, with the greatest determination and perseverance, study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Every word and instruction from Chairman Mao must be followed closely, deeply understood, linked to reality, and strictly adhered to. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, we must fight against selfishness and revisionism, effectively resist the infiltration of various bourgeois ideologies, maintain the purity of the working class in politics, ideology, and organization, and make China's working class a force absolutely led by the Communist Party of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, highly proletarianized, revolutionized, and militarized industrial army.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 5th: Under the warm care of our most red and red sun in our hearts, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, and in the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebellion Representatives Congress (Workers' Congress) was successfully held from December 3rd to 5th.

The successful convening of the Shanghai Workers' Congress is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

This meeting is a grand review of the brilliant achievements of the Shanghai working class in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a rally for all Shanghai workers to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. It is also a meeting to strengthen the construction of the Shanghai working class and march towards the goal of being highly proletarianized, revolutionized, and militarized. The convening of the meeting marks that the Shanghai workers' movement, with its glorious revolutionary tradition, has entered a new stage and reached a higher level. The meeting strongly expressed the lofty aspirations and firm beliefs of the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels: We must firmly establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must build the Shanghai working class into a force armed with Mao Zedong Thought, always full of vigor, rich in revolutionary fighting spirit, and a strong revolutionary force.

Vice Chairman of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, read a congratulatory telegram from the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebellion Representatives Congress at the meeting.

The congratulatory telegram from the Central Cultural Revolution Group once again embodies the great leader Chairman Mao's meticulous care and greatest support for the Shanghai working class and all revolutionary people in Shanghai, adding boundless strength to all the representatives present.

"The tiger crouches and the dragon coils, today surpassing yesterday. The world is turned upside down, and the sentiments are stirring."

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Shanghai working class and the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, have made a great fuss, undergone great tempering and testing, fully played the role of the main force, and made brilliant contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai and the country. The greatest happiness for the Shanghai working class and the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels is that all their struggles have been conducted under the direct command of the great helmsman Chairman Mao. At this time last year, when the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels raised the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries" and engaged in a heart-pounding struggle with China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, Chen Pishan and Cao Qiqiu, and organized the scattered revolutionary rebel forces, Chairman Mao directly supported this revolutionary action and the establishment of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebellion Headquarters. In January of this year, they joined forces with all revolutionary factions in the city to launch the "January Revolution" storm that shocked the world, completely destroyed the bourgeois command center within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee led by Chen Pishan and Cao Qiqiu, and seized all the party, government, financial, and cultural powers usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party back into the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions, establishing the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. After the establishment of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, the Shanghai working class has become a strong pillar of the new revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organ. They have executed the revolutionary orders issued by Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, such as revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and fighting against selfishness and revisionism, with the greatest determination, the fastest action, and the most remarkable results. They have played a leading and exemplary role in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoting revolution and production, and fighting against selfishness and revisionism.

The Shanghai working class and the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels deeply understand that every victory they have achieved is a great victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many representatives said with infinite emotion that even if the East China Sea's water were used as ink, it would not be enough to write down the great achievements of Chairman Mao; even if a thousand songs were sung, it would not be enough to sing the boundless kindness of Chairman Mao. They firmly declared: Even if the sky changes and the earth changes, our red hearts loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought will never change! Even if the earth shakes and the mountains tremble, we will never waver in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought! Even if our heads are cut off and our blood flows, we will never abandon Mao Zedong Thought!

This meeting was held under the direct leadership of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. The leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, the responsible comrades of the three military forces stationed in Shanghai, and the representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai participated in this meeting. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao delivered an important speech at the meeting.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao warmly congratulated the successful convening of the Shanghai Workers' Congress. He pointed out that this is a great event worth celebrating in the Shanghai Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement, an unprecedented great event in the history of Shanghai's revolutionary workers' movement, and an important sign of the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai. He hoped that through this meeting, the Shanghai working class and the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels would push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and strive to complete the glorious tasks proposed in the congratulatory telegram from the Central Cultural Revolution Group!

The responsible comrade of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebellion Headquarters, Wang Hongwen, made a report titled "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Resolutely Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the End" to the meeting. The report emphasized the necessity, importance, and urgency of using Mao Zedong Thought to further organize and educate our class forces, strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the working class. The report pointed out that our working class not only needs to carry this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end but also to sustainably consolidate and develop this victory. Not only do we need to carry the Chinese revolution to the end, but we also need to support the world revolution, liberate all mankind, and achieve communism worldwide. To accomplish such a great historical mission, we must have a working class force that is absolutely led by the Communist Party of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, full of vigor, revolutionized, and militarized. The more than a year of struggle practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has proven that our Shanghai working class is indeed the inheritor of the 100-year revolutionary tradition of Shanghai revolutionary workers and a strong force of the great Chinese working class cultivated and led by Chairman Mao. However, we also see that the poison of China's Khrushchev's revisionist line in the workers' movement, the infiltration of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies in society, and various non-proletarian elements, including some members of the exploiting classes, entering the factories, inevitably bring in various non-proletarian thoughts. Therefore, we must strengthen the construction of our working class forces a thousand times, especially the ideological and organizational construction of the workers' revolutionary rebels, and effectively resist the infiltration and influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts.

The report emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the construction of our working class forces. Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the fundamental task. We must vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought among the workers, further and sustainably carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and truly achieve the goal of not letting go of Chairman Mao's books, not letting go of Chairman Mao's words, and not letting go of Chairman Mao's teachings, turning the factories into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought!

"In a sea voyage, the helmsman is relied upon; in revolution, Mao Zedong Thought is relied upon." During the meeting, more than ten thousand workers' revolutionary rebel representatives, filled with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great teacher Chairman Mao, specially discussed their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, fighting against selfishness and revisionism, breaking selfishness and establishing the public, and realizing the revolutionization of people's thoughts. They specially displayed the brilliant achievements of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolution, guide work, and guide everything. Representatives from the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Dyeing and Chemical Factory No. 8, Dongfanghong Shipbuilding Factory, Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Screw Factory No. 8, Hudong Shipbuilding Factory, Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Electronic Tube Factory, and the Workers' Rebel Brigade of Shanghai Automated Instrument Factory No. 9 spoke at the meeting. They expressed the deepest feelings and the most enthusiastic language of the Shanghai working class: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your series of important instructions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the lighthouses guiding us forward and the strongest ideological weapons ensuring the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will definitely follow them, follow them word for word, and follow them letter for letter. We will definitely be the vanguards of fighting against revisionism and the pioneers of fighting against selfishness. We will definitely launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and denounce China's Khrushchev's revisionist line, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, work hard on the ground, pool our strengths, be bold and cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, and do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units. We will grasp the revolution and promote production, and be the proletarian revolutionary factions determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

In the most enthusiastic, most exciting applause, cheers, and slogan-shouting, the meeting unanimously adopted a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao.

The meeting also unanimously adopted a letter to all revolutionary workers and revolutionary workers in the city, calling on all revolutionary workers and revolutionary workers in the city to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, always direct the spearhead of the struggle at China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, Chen Pishan, Cao Qiqiu, and Yang Xiguang; to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," and be models of grasping the revolution and promoting production; to take "fighting against selfishness and revisionism" as the key, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in ideology; to hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," always believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and be models of supporting and learning from the army; to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance; to vigorously establish and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further and sustainably carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; to shoulder the great historical mission given to the Shanghai working class by the times, with a heart for the motherland and an eye for the world, contribute all our strength to the thorough victory of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought be planted all over Shanghai, all over China, and all over the world!

The meeting also adopted the new list of commissioners of the leadership organ of the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels—the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebellion Headquarters, strengthening and improving its leadership core.

The representatives of the three military forces stationed in Shanghai, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Shanghai, and the Shanghai Red Guards spoke at the meeting, warmly congratulating the successful convening of the Workers' Congress and firmly declaring to unite with the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels, fight together, and strive together for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    在最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下
    上海市工代会胜利举行
    张春桥同志宣读中央文革小组贺电并作了重要讲话
    会议号召全市革命职工进一步落实毛主席最新指示，把文化大革命进行到底，把上海工人阶级建设成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的，永远朝气蓬勃的，富有革命战斗力的坚强的革命队伍。
    编者按：在无产阶级文化大革命中作过光辉贡献的上海工人阶级，是我国工人阶级的一支坚强队伍。上海市工人革命造反派代表会议的胜利召开，标志着上海革命工人运动在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，进入一个崭新的阶段，提高到一个更高的水平。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    工人阶级是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的领导力量和主力军。工人阶级不但要把我国社会主义革命进行到底，而且要支援世界革命，解放全人类，在全世界实现共产主义。要完成这个伟大的历史任务，工人阶级就要以最大的决心，最大的毅力，活学活用毛主席著作。毛主席的每一句话，每个指示，都要努力紧跟，深刻领会，联系实际，句句照办。以毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，有效地抵制形形色色的资产阶级思想的侵蚀，保持工人阶级政治上、思想上、组织上的纯洁性，使我国工人阶级成为一支在中国共产党绝对领导下的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的，非常无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化的产业大军。
    据新华社上海五日　电在我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，上海市工人革命造反派代表会议（工代会）于十二月三日至五日胜利举行。
    上海工代会的胜利召开，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    这次会议是对上海工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的光辉成就的盛大检阅，是上海工人阶级进一步落实毛主席最新指示，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的誓师大会，也是加强上海工人阶级队伍的建设，向着非常无产阶级化、革命化、战斗化的目标进军的大会。大会的召开，标志着具有光荣革命传统的上海工人运动进入了一个崭新的阶段，提高到一个更新的水平。大会最强烈地表达了上海工人革命造反派的崇高愿望和坚定信念：一定要大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，把上海工人阶级建设成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的，永远朝气蓬勃的，富有革命战斗力的坚强的革命队伍。
    中央文化革命小组副组长张春桥同志在会上宣读了中央文化革命小组致上海市工人革命造反派代表会议的贺电。
    中央文化革命小组的贺电又一次体现了伟大领袖毛主席对上海工人阶级和上海全体革命人民无微不至的关怀和最大的支持，给到会全体代表增添了无穷的力量。
      “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”
    上海工人阶级，上海工人革命造反派在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大闹革命，经受了极大的锻炼和考验，充分发挥了主力军的作用，对上海和全国的无产阶级文化大革命作出了光辉的贡献。上海工人阶级，上海工人革命造反派感到最大幸福的是，他们的全部斗争都是在伟大统帅毛主席的直接指挥下进行的。去年这个时候，当上海工人革命造反派高举对反动派造反有理的大旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流展开惊心动魄的斗争，把分散的革命造反队伍组织起来的时候，毛主席直接支持了这个革命行动，支持了上海工人革命造反总司令部的成立。今年一月，他们同全市无产阶级革命派联合起来，发动了震惊世界的“一月革命”的风暴，彻底摧毁了以陈丕显、曹荻秋为首的旧上海市委内的资产阶级司令部，把党内一小撮走资派窃据的党、政、财、文大权统统夺回到无产阶级革命派手中，建立了上海市革命委员会。上海市革命委员会成立以后，上海工人阶级又成为新生的革命三结合临时权力机构的强大支柱。他们对毛主席的无产阶级司令部发出的革命大批判、革命大联合、革命三结合、斗私批修等一系列战斗号令，执行得最坚决，行动最迅速，成绩最显著。他们在活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命、促生产，斗私批修等方面都发挥了带头和模范作用。
    上海工人阶级，上海工人革命造反派深深懂得，他们所取得的每一个胜利，都是伟大的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。许多代表无限深情地说，倾东海之水作墨，也写不尽毛主席他老人家的丰功伟绩；唱起千万曲最好的颂歌，也唱不完毛主席他老人家的浩荡恩情。他们坚定不移地表示：天变地变，忠于伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的红心永不变！地动山摇，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗决不动摇！头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想永不丢！
    这次会议是在上海市革命委员会的直接领导下举行的。上海市革命委员会领导成员、中国人民解放军驻沪三军负责人以及上海各革命群众组织的代表参加了这次会议。张春桥同志在会上作了重要讲话。
    张春桥同志热烈祝贺上海工代会的胜利召开。他指出，这是上海无产阶级文化大革命运动中值得庆贺的大事，是上海革命工人运动史上前所未有的大事，也是上海无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好的一个重要标志。他希望上海工人阶级，上海工人革命造反派，通过这次会议，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，为完成中央文化革命小组贺电中提出的光荣任务而奋斗！
    上海工人革命造反总司令部负责人王洪文向会议作了题为《高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底》的报告。报告强调了用毛泽东思想进一步组织和教育自己的阶级队伍，加强工人阶级队伍的思想建设和组织建设的必要性、重要性和迫切性。报告指出，我们工人阶级不但要把这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，而且要持久地巩固和发展这个胜利，不但要把中国革命进行到底，而且要支援世界革命，解放全人类，在全世界实现共产主义。要完成这样一个伟大的历史任务，就必须有一支在中国共产党绝对领导下的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的、朝气蓬勃的、革命化、战斗化的工人阶级队伍。一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践证明，我们上海工人阶级不愧是一百年来上海革命工人战斗传统的继承者，不愧是毛主席领导和培育出来的伟大的中国工人阶级的一支坚强队伍。但是我们也看到，中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线在工人运动中的流毒，社会上资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的侵蚀，各种非无产阶级的人员，包括一部分剥削阶级分子进了工厂，也不可避免地带来各种非无产阶级的思想。因此，必须千百倍地加强我们工人阶级队伍的建设，首先是我们工人革命造反派的思想建设和组织建设，有效地抵制资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的侵蚀和影响。
    报告强调指出，毛泽东思想是我们工人阶级队伍建设的灵魂。活学活用毛主席著作是我们阶级队伍建设的根本。要大力向工人群众灌输毛泽东思想，更加深入持久地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，真正做到手不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的话，行动不离毛主席的教导，把工厂企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。会议期间，一万多名工人革命造反派代表满怀对伟大导师毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，大讲特讲活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，破私立公，实现人的思想革命化的体会，大摆特摆用毛泽东思想统帅革命、统帅工作、统帅一切所取得的光辉成就。上海染化八厂革命委员会、东方红造船厂、上海螺帽八厂革命委员会、沪东造船厂、上海电子管厂革命委员会、上海自动化仪表九厂工人造反大队代表在会上发了言。他们用最深厚的感情，最热情的语言说出了上海工人阶级的心里话：毛主席啊，毛主席！您在无产阶级文化大革命中发出的一系列重要指示是指引我们前进的灯塔，是保证无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的最强大的思想武器。我们一定坚决照办，句句照办，字字照办，誓作批修的先锋，斗私的闯将。我们一定进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，彻底批深、批透、批倒、批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，脚踏实地，群策群力，大胆谨慎，戒骄戒躁，搞好本单位的斗批改。我们要抓革命，促生产，做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
    在最最热烈、最最激动人心的掌声、欢呼声和口号声中，会议一致通过了给毛主席的致敬电。
    会议还一致通过了给全市工人革命造反派和革命职工的信，号召全市工人革命造反派和革命职工，要牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终把斗争矛头指向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋、杨西光之流；要坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，做抓革命、促生产的模范；要以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合；要高举“拥军爱民”的旗帜，永远相信和依靠人民解放军，做拥护解放军、学习解放军的模范；要进一步巩固工农联盟；要大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，进一步深入持久地开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动；要肩负起时代赋予上海工人阶级的伟大历史使命，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，为中国革命和世界革命的彻底胜利贡献我们的一切力量，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，插遍全上海，插遍全中国，插遍全世界！
    会议还通过了上海工人革命造反派的领导机构——上海工人革命造反总司令部新的委员名单，健全和加强了它的领导核心。
    中国人民解放军驻沪三军代表、上海市贫下中农代表和上海市革命红卫兵代表分别在会上发言，热烈祝贺工代会胜利召开，坚决表示同上海工人革命造反派团结在一起，战斗在一起，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而共同奋斗！
