	Heartfelt Congratulations on the Seventh Anniversary of the Establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam
	Chairman Ho Chi Minh Calls for South and North Compatriots to Fight Side by Side to Defeat the U.S. Imperialists
	The More Brutal, Stubborn, and Cunning the U.S. Imperialists Are, the Greater Their Defeat Will Be

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 20th - On the 19th, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, sent a telegram to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and other members of the Central Committee, extending the warmest congratulations on the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To the Chairman and Members of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam:

	On the glorious seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, I extend my warmest congratulations to the Chairman and Members of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and to all compatriots, soldiers, and cadres in the South.

	Over the past seven years, under the banner of the National Liberation Front, the heroic people of the South and the armed forces have achieved tremendous victories, shattering all the aggressive plans of the American aggressors and their lackeys. The continuous victories at the beginning of this dry season have brought joy and encouragement to our people and people around the world. For the past three years, the people and soldiers of the North, fighting side by side with the people of the South, have shot down more than 2,660 American aggressor planes, greatly developed production, and wholeheartedly supported their fellow countrymen in the South, determined to overcome the American aggressors together with the people of the South.

	The victories of our people are forcing the enemy into a quagmire, a passive position, and suffering heavy defeats.

	I believe that in the coming period, the military and people of the South, with the spirit of "everything for the victory over the American aggressors," will strive to achieve the political program of the National Liberation Front and achieve even greater victories.

	The more brutal, stubborn, and cunning the U.S. imperialists are, the greater their defeat will be.

	Our people's resistance is long and arduous, but it will surely achieve complete victory.

	With warm and victorious greetings!

	Ho Chi Minh
	Hanoi, December 19, 1967

    最热烈祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年
    胡志明主席号召南北同胞并肩战斗打败美帝
    美帝国主义越残暴、顽固和狡猾，它的失败也就越大
    新华社河内二十日电　越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席十九日打电报给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿和其他中央委员，最热烈地祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年。电报全文如下：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席及各位委员：
    在光荣的越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的时候，我谨向南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席、各位委员以及南方全体同胞、战士和干部，致以最热烈的祝贺。
    七年来，在民族解放阵线旗帜的指引下，英雄的南方同胞和人民武装力量已经取得了巨大的胜利，粉碎了美国强盗及其走狗的一切侵略计划。这个旱季初期的接连的胜利，使我们全国人民和全世界人民欢欣鼓舞。三年来，与南方同胞并肩战斗的北方军民，击落美国强盗飞机二千六百六十多架，大力发展生产和全心全意支援骨肉的南方同胞，决心与南方同胞一起战胜美国侵略强盗。
    我国人民的胜利，正在迫使敌人处于深陷泥潭、被动和遭到惨重失败的境地。
    我相信，在即将到来期间，南方军民本着“一切为了战胜美国侵略强盗”的精神，努力实现民族解放阵线的政治纲领，将取得更加辉煌的胜利。
    美帝国主义越残暴、顽固和狡猾，那么，它的失败也就越大。
    我国人民的抗战是长期和艰苦的，但必将取得彻底的胜利。
      致以
    亲爱和决胜的敬礼！
                              胡志明
      河内　一九六七年十二月十九日
