Since the Khrushchev revisionist clique seized control of the leadership of the Soviet Party and state, they have not only fully restored capitalism within the Soviet Union but have also completely betrayed proletarian internationalism in their foreign policy, surrendered to imperialism, betrayed the revolution, and caused serious harm to the international communist movement and the world revolutionary cause.

The Soviet revisionist clique has already performed sufficiently on the international stage with their acts of surrender and betrayal, and the traitorous face of the proletariat has been fully exposed. Yet, this gang of traitors claims that they have "restrained the freedom of action of imperialism on the international stage," that they "consider supporting international revolutionary forces as an inseparable part of their activities," that they "have extensively supported the peoples of the brother socialist countries in the past and present," and so on. They have said all the good things and done all the bad things, as if they do not know the meaning of shame.

But lies cannot cover up the facts.

From the talks at Camp David to the collusion at Hollybush, from the humiliating surrender in the Caribbean crisis to the betrayal of the interests of the Arab people in the Middle East, from peddling the "peace talks" fraud in the Vietnam issue to convening the European labor traitors' conference to promote "European détente," allowing American imperialism to free its hands to invade Vietnam and Asia, from the Moscow Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapon Tests to plotting with the United States to establish an anti-ballistic missile system, all these counter-revolutionary acts, are they not to help the aggressive actions of imperialism, rather than to "restrain" the "freedom of action" of imperialism? The facts show that the Soviet revisionist clique is the number one accomplice of American imperialism. The head of the American empire does not hide the fact that the help of the Soviet revisionist clique will make it "less difficult, not more difficult" for them to carry out their policies of aggression and war. Western bourgeois newspapers even openly say that Moscow has become an "outpost" of American imperialism in the East.

The Soviet revisionist clique is extremely afraid of revolution. Wherever there is a revolutionary movement, they rush to act as the counter-revolutionary fire brigade, either deceiving the revolutionary people into laying down their arms or collaborating with the reactionaries of various countries to carry out armed suppression. When the revolutionary people of Burma, who had been fighting for twenty years, heavily struck the Nay Win reactionary government, the Soviet revisionists praised Nay Win, saying that the Nay Win reactionary government was a "revolutionary government," trying to lull the revolutionary people into complacency; when the revolutionary people of Indonesia rose up to fight against the fascist regime of Suharto, the Soviet revisionists immediately provided Suharto with weapons to kill people; when the revolutionary people of India just ignited the flames of armed struggle, the Soviet revisionists provided the Indian reactionaries with nine hundred million dollars in military aid and declared that the Indian reactionaries could have whatever they wanted, helping them to suppress the revolution. The traitors of the Soviet revisionists claim to "support" the "international revolutionary forces," but do the facts not prove that you are supporting the international counter-revolutionary forces? This counter-revolutionary behavior has indeed become an inseparable part of your "own activities." You have turned the Soviet Union into the headquarters of world counter-revolutionary forces.

The Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly talks about "extensively supporting" the "peoples of the socialist countries." How shameless! A few years ago, when our country was hit by natural disasters, you, in collusion with the imperialist anti-China activities and the counter-revolutionary conspiracies of our class enemies, withdrew experts and tore up agreements. This is your "support" for the socialist countries! Just when American imperialism was escalating the war and plotting to "bomb to force peace" on the Vietnam battlefield, you actively peddled the "peace talks" fraud, trying to force the Vietnamese people to surrender. This is your "support" for the Vietnamese people! You also, through so-called "mutual assistance and cooperation" and "international division of labor," plundered some Eastern European countries and Mongolia economically. Enough! What you did was purely the behavior of robbers who fall into the pit and take advantage of the fire, evil deeds of harming others for personal gain and the strong preying on the weak! Where in you is there even a trace of proletarian internationalism! You are a bunch of unadulterated nationalistic philistines!

The Soviet revisionist clique has completely betrayed the cause of the world revolution of the proletariat. They have become the most dangerous enemy of the revolutionary people of the whole world. The great teacher Lenin said fifty years ago: "The struggle against imperialism, if it is not closely linked with the struggle against opportunism, is only an empty phrase or a deceit." Today, in the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory, to oppose imperialism led by the United States, one must oppose modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU.

Soviet revisionist traitors, your beautiful dream will not last long. Your fascist rule at home and your acts of surrender and betrayal abroad have already put a noose around your own necks. The Soviet people, who have been educated by Lenin and Stalin and have a glorious revolutionary tradition, will surely rise up in rebellion, overthrow you all, and hoist the banner of proletarian internationalism to join the ranks of the great world revolutionary struggle, marching forward together with the revolutionary people of all countries!

　　苏修集团是世界革命的大叛徒
　　辛南凯
    自从赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了苏联党和国家的领导之后，他们不仅在苏联国内实现了全面资本主义复辟，而且在对外政策方面彻底背叛无产阶级国际主义，投降帝国主义，叛卖革命，给国际共产主义运动和世界革命事业造成严重危害。
    苏修集团在国际舞台上的投降叛卖活动已经表演得够充分，无产阶级的叛徒面目已经暴露得淋漓尽致了。可是，这一伙叛徒却胡说什么他们“约束了帝国主义在国际舞台上的行动自由”呀，什么他们“把支持国际革命力量看成是自己的活动的不可分割的一部分”呀，什么他们“过去和现在都广泛地支援了兄弟的社会主义各国人民”呀，等等。真是好话说尽，坏事做绝，不知人间还有羞耻二字。
    但是，谎言是掩盖不了事实的。
    苏修集团从戴维营会谈到霍利布什的勾结，从在加勒比海危机中屈辱投降，到在中东事件中叛卖阿拉伯人民的利益，从在越南问题上推销“和谈”骗局，到召开欧洲工贼会议大搞“欧洲缓和”，使美帝国主义腾出手脚来侵略越南和亚洲，从莫斯科三国禁止核试验条约到同美国策划建立反弹道导弹系统，这一切反革命勾当，难道不是为了帮助帝国主义的侵略行动，而是什么为了“约束”帝国主义的“行动自由”吗？种种事实表明，苏修集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。美帝的头目也毫不隐讳地宣称，苏修集团对他们的帮助，使他们推行侵略政策和战争政策的“困难将会减少，而不会增加”。西方的资产阶级报刊则更是公开说，莫斯科已成为美帝国主义“在东方开设的一个分店”。
    苏修集团极端害怕革命。哪里发生革命运动，它就跑到哪里充当反革命的消防队，或者是用欺骗手段诱迫革命人民放下武器，或者是联合各国反动派实行武装镇压。当坚持武装斗争二十年的缅甸革命人民沉重地打击了奈温反动政府时，苏修却大吹大捧奈温，说奈温反动政府是什么
  “革命政府”，企图麻痹革命人民意志；当印尼革命人民起来进行反对苏哈托法西斯政权的斗争时，苏修立即向苏哈托提供杀人武器；当印度革命人民刚一燃起武装斗争的烽火，苏修又向印度反动派提供九亿美元军事援助，并声称印度反动派要什么“就给什么”，帮助它镇压革命。苏修叛徒们口口声声说“支持”了“国际革命力量”，而事实难道不是雄辩地证明，你们支持的正是国际反革命力量吗？这种反革命的行径的的确确已经成了你们“自己活动的不可分割的一部分”。你们已经把苏联变成为世界反革命势力的大本营。
    苏修集团还无耻地大谈什么“广泛地支援了”“社会主义各国人民”。真是死不要脸！几年前，正当我国遭到自然灾害，你们配合帝国主义的反华活动和我国阶级敌人的反革命阴谋，撤走专家，撕毁协定。这就是你们对社会主义国家的“支援”！正当美帝国主义在越南战场大搞“战争升级”、“以炸迫和”的阴谋时，你们积极兜售“和谈”骗局，企图迫使越南人民投降。这也就是你们对越南人民的“支援”！你们还通过所谓“互助合作”、“国际分工”，对东欧一些国家和蒙古肆意进行经济掠夺。够了！你们干的，纯粹是落井下石，趁火打劫的强盗行为，是损人利己、弱肉强食的罪恶勾当！在你们身上，哪里还找得到一丝一毫无产阶级国际主义的影子！你们是一伙不折不扣的民族主义市侩！
    苏修集团已经彻底背叛了无产阶级世界革命的事业。他们已经成为全世界革命人民的最危险的敌人。伟大的导师列宁早在五十年前就说过：“反对帝国主义的斗争如果不同反对机会主义的斗争紧密地联系起来，那只是一句空话或欺人之谈。”今天，在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，要反对以美国为首的帝国主义，就必须反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。
    苏修叛徒们，你们的美梦不会长了。你们对内的法西斯统治，对外的投降叛卖，已经在你们自己的脖子上套上了一条又一条绞索。受过列宁和斯大林教导的、有着光荣革命传统的苏联人民，一定会起来造反，将你们统统打倒，高举无产阶级国际主义大旗，投入世界革命的伟大战斗行列，同各国革命人民一起，共同前进！
