On the evening of December 3, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received us. This is the greatest happiness of our lives. The most beautiful ideal we have been longing for day and night has finally been realized. Seeing Chairman Mao, radiant and full of vigor, walking briskly towards us, I felt as if my eyes were filled with a dazzling glow, and I couldn't help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the great savior of the working people, the brightest red sun in our hearts. It is you who personally established the first red revolutionary base in the world and created the first thoroughly revolutionary people's armed forces. It is you who formulated a series of correct military lines, principles, and strategies and tactics for people's war for our army. It is you who led us to gallop south and north, cross turbulent rivers, and ford perilous shoals, overcoming darkness and welcoming light. It is you who personally ignited the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashed the evil plot of Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism, and guided us to march forward on the broad road to communism.

I will never forget that more than twenty years ago, I first happily saw you at a mass rally in Yan'an. From then on, a red sun that never sets rose in my heart. At that time, the Japanese invaders were launching a major offensive in central China, and the Chinese nation was at a critical juncture of life and death. It was you who personally led and mobilized us to fight against the enemy and carry out production and self-reliance movements, showing us the brilliant path to finally defeat Japanese imperialism.

I will never forget that in September 1965, I, along with the representatives of the "August 6" naval battle, happily saw you for the second time! What a great encouragement that was! Since then, I have become even more determined to follow the path of emphasizing politics and have engaged in a head-on struggle against the bourgeois military line promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, defending your proletarian military line.

Most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Recently, you issued the great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight against selfishness." These five golden words have illuminated my path to continue the revolution. In the practice of struggling against the bourgeois military line, I have deeply felt that your brilliant thoughts are a powerful ideological weapon for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. To truly master your brilliant thoughts, one must combine learning with practice and see immediate results; one must strive to follow every word and every instruction of yours, deeply understand, connect with reality, and carry them out resolutely. I solemnly declare to you: I will definitely study and apply your brilliant works, follow your great strategic deployment, adhere to your latest instructions, go deep among the masses, humbly be a student of the masses, and together with the masses, criticize and repudiate revisionism, improve superior-subordinate relationships, and carry out ideological revolutionization. I will always be a promoter of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, forever loyal to you, to your brilliant thoughts, and to your proletarian revolutionary line. I will fight to defend your revolutionary line while alive and dedicate my life to defend your revolutionary line when dead.

    一心跟着毛主席永生永世不动摇
    海军学习毛主席著作积极分子、四四一一部队部队长  武毅
    十二月三日晚上，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见了我们，这是我们一生中最大最大的幸福。我们日日盼、夜夜盼的最美好的理想终于实现了。看着毛主席红光满面，神采奕奕，向我们健步走来，我只觉得眼前霞光万道，辉煌夺目，情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是劳动人民的大救星，您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。是您亲手创建了世界上第一个红色革命根据地，缔造了世界上第一支彻底革命的人民武装。是您为我军制订了一系列正确的建军路线、方针和人民战争的战略战术。是您率领我们驰骋南北，跨激流，渡险滩，战胜了黑暗，迎来了光明。是您亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，指引我们向共产主义的康庄大道胜利前进。
    我永远也不会忘记，二十多年前，我在延安的一次群众大会上，第一次幸福地见到了您。从那时起，我心中就升起了永远不落的红太阳。当时正是日寇大举进犯中原，中华民族处于生死存亡的紧要关头，是您亲自领导、动员我们进行对敌斗争，开展生产自救运动，给我们指明了最后战胜日本帝国主义的光辉道路。
    我永远也不会忘记，一九六五年九月，我随同“八·六”海战的部队代表，第二次幸福地见到了您！这是多么巨大的鼓舞啊！从那以后，我更加坚定了走突出政治的道路，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线，进行了针锋相对的斗争，捍卫您的无产阶级建军路线。
    最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席！最近您发出了要斗私，批修的伟大号召，这五个金光闪闪的大字，给我照亮了继续革命的路程。在同资产阶级军事路线进行斗争的实践中，我深深体会到，您的光辉思想，是斗私批修的强大思想武器。真正把您的光辉思想学到手，就要做到学用结合，立竿见影；做到对您的每一句话，每一个指示，努力紧跟，深刻领会，联系实际，坚决照办。我向您庄严宣誓：一定活学活用您的光辉著作，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，遵照您的最新指示，深入到群众中去，老老实实做群众的小学生，和群众一起斗私批修，搞好上下级关系，搞好思想革命化，永做中国革命和世界革命的促进派，永远忠于您，忠于您的光辉思想，忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。生为捍卫您的革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫您的革命路线而献身。
