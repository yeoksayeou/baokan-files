Kong Xiangshan, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Institute, is often praised by others as a good "class leader." However, he does not see himself in this way. He humbly learns from cadres and fellow students because he keeps a "gap account" in his heart.

History is advancing, and the times are leaping forward. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has rapidly nurtured a large number of revolutionary successors. Kong Xiangshan, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Postal and Telecommunications Institute, is one of the countless new people.

In the leading cadre group, whether it is the revolutionary youngsters who have fought side by side with him or the experienced revolutionary old cadres, when they mention Kong Xiangshan, they all praise him for studying Chairman Mao's thoughts well, working diligently, living a simple and frugal life, being able to blend in with the masses, being very humble, and being a good "class leader."

However, Kong Xiangshan himself does not see it this way. During the days when he worked with a few standing committee members, he always humbly learned from the strengths of others and analyzed the merits of each person. In his heart, he always keeps a "gap account."

There is a standing committee member in the Revolutionary Committee responsible for propaganda work. Although this work is very demanding, he always tries every means to complete it. Once, he had to formulate a plan to study Chairman Mao's works and prepare to discuss it with the masses at a meeting the next day. However, the meeting the previous day ended late, but this comrade still worked overtime until late at night, completing the task as originally planned. Kong Xiangshan learned from this incident and found a gap in himself: "My work enthusiasm is not as strong as his, and my sense of responsibility is not as strong as his."

There is an old cadre who is not in good health but works diligently. Kong Xiangshan and a few other comrades advised him to rest, but the old cadre said: "As long as I live, I will follow Chairman Mao and do revolution every day." During the educational revolution, some students posted big-character posters criticizing this old cadre. The old cadre repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works and sincerely said: "Over the past decade, I have been poisoned by a lot of revisionism, my worldview has not been thoroughly transformed, I have said wrong things and done wrong things, the masses' criticism has awakened me, I must learn well from the masses." Kong Xiangshan saw this and took it to heart. He compared himself to the old cadre, who sometimes got angry when hearing criticisms. He found another gap: "My heart for the revolutionary cause is not as red as his, and my attitude towards the masses is not as sincere as his."

Kong Xiangshan is still a 21-year-old youth and a first-year student. Through revolutionary practice, he has come to realize: "Being with the masses all the time, you have more ideas, more wisdom, richer thoughts, more enthusiasm, and things are easier to do." When he completes a task, his first action is to go to the masses, hold a "Zhuge Liang" meeting, and let everyone contribute their ideas; when work encounters difficulties, he seeks advice from the masses. He is both an "official" and a common person.

    邮电学院革命委员会主任孔祥山，别人称他是个好“班长”，他自己不这样看。他虚心向干部和同学学习。因为：
    他心里有本“差距账”
    历史在前进，时代在飞跃。
    毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，使一大批革命接班人迅速成长。北京邮电学院革命委员会主任孔祥山同志，就是千千万万新人中的一个。
    在领导班子中，不论是同他一起并肩战斗过的革命小将，还是富有经验的革命老干部，提起孔祥山，都称赞他毛泽东思想学得好，工作认真，生活艰苦朴素，能和群众打成一片，很虚心，是一个好“班长”。
    可是，孔祥山同志自己却不这样看。他在和几个常委共同工作的日子里，总是虚心学习别人的长处，分析每个人的优点，在他的心里经常装着一本“差距账”。
    革委会有一位常委负责宣传工作，尽管这项工作任务很繁重，但他总是千方百计地想办法完成。有一次，要制定一个学习毛主席著作的计划，准备在第二天开大会时交给群众讨论。可是头天开会很晚才结束，这位同志仍然加班到深夜，按原计划完成了任务。孔祥山从这件事中，给自己找出一条差距：“工作干劲不如他大，责任心不如他强”。
    有一位老干部，身体不好，但工作勤勤恳恳。孔祥山和其他几个同志劝他注意休息，这位老干部却表示：自己活一天就要紧跟毛主席干一天革命。在教育革命中，有些同学给这位老干部贴出了大字报。这位老干部一遍又一遍地学习毛主席著作，诚恳地说：“十几年来我中了不少修正主义的毒，世界观没有得到彻底改造，说过错话，做过错事，群众的批评给我敲了警钟，我要很好地向群众学习。”这件事孔祥山看在眼里，记在心上，他对照自己有时听见批评，心里就发火。他又从中找到了差距：“对革命事业的心不如他红，对待群众的态度不如他诚恳。”
    孔祥山还是一个二十一岁的青年，一年级学生。在革命实践中，他体会到：“经常和群众在一起，就办法多，聪明得多，思想丰富得多，干劲足得多，事情好办得多。”他完成一项任务，第一个行动就是到群众中去，召开“诸葛亮”会，让大家献计献策；当工作遇到困难的时候，他就向群众请教。他既当“官”，又当老百姓。　杨建科
