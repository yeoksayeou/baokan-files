	Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of combining revolution with production.
	The nation launches a winter campaign for agricultural and water conservancy construction.
	The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are determined to further arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, and create conditions for an even greater agricultural harvest next year.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 8th, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in rural areas across the country, with the slogan "Criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight selfishness" as the guideline, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great policy of "combining revolution with production." They carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, launching a new high tide of agricultural and water conservancy construction centered on winter water conservancy projects, creating conditions for an even greater agricultural harvest next year.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, mobilizing hundreds of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has further penetrated people's hearts. As the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres' thinking becomes increasingly revolutionary, the situation in the countryside regarding the proletarian cultural revolution and production construction is excellent and getting better. This year, agricultural production has achieved a good harvest for the sixth consecutive year. The great development of agricultural and water conservancy construction has played a major role in achieving this year's agricultural bumper harvest. According to statistics from relevant departments, in seventeen provinces and autonomous regions including Hebei, Heilongjiang, Shandong, and Henan, the irrigation area increased, the number of mechanical and electrical drainage and irrigation facilities constructed, and the number of new wells drilled this year are the most and the best since 1961. The area of terraced fields, ridged fields, and various types of terraces has also significantly increased.

	Through this year's production practice, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have further realized the great significance of Chairman Mao's policy of "combining revolution with production." They are determined to continue to focus on revolution and vigorously promote production this winter and next spring, carrying out agricultural and water conservancy construction, and making new contributions to the proletarian cultural revolution and socialist construction.

	To better carry out agricultural and water conservancy construction work, most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have held meetings on agricultural and water conservancy construction, making specific arrangements for this winter and next spring's agricultural and water conservancy construction work and strengthening leadership. Many regions have launched a high tide of agricultural and water conservancy construction. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres across Shandong Province are determined to take the people of Lijiazhuang in Juxian County, who have achieved great success in mountain and water conservation, as an example, further carrying out agricultural and water conservancy construction and treating barren mountains and evil waters. Currently, more than fifty thousand people have gone to the Hongwei River and Tuhaizi River construction sites, and the progress of the project is relatively fast. In Hebei, more than 260,000 people are working on the Haihe River water conservancy project. They are determined to complete the task of controlling the Haihe River after another winter and spring. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, are currently seizing the good opportunity before freezing, launching a high tide of agricultural and water conservancy construction. Now, the county has completed 1.81 million cubic meters of earthwork, drilled 77 "three-use wells," and planted 21,000 acres of trees.

	In this year's winter water conservancy activities, each place, following the principle of "Dazhai spirit, small-scale first, comprehensive configuration, and emphasis on management, better serving agricultural production," while planning and focusing on the construction of large-scale agricultural and water conservancy projects, widely mobilizes the masses to concentrate their efforts on carrying out agricultural and water conservancy construction with small-scale water conservancy as the main focus. Most of the northern regions are currently focusing on drilling wells, digging springs, diverting and leading water, leveling land, and actively building terraced fields, ridged fields, and square fields. The Loess Plateau in the west is engaged in water and soil conservation projects, building terraced fields and dam lands. In the south, some regions frequently affected by floods and typhoons mainly continue to build anti-flood and anti-wind facilities; in some drought-prone areas, the focus is on building water storage, water diversion, and water lifting projects, while also carrying out garden construction.

    坚决把毛主席抓革命促生产的方针落实到行动上
    全国掀起冬修农田水利高潮
    广大贫农下中农和革命干部决心进一步用毛泽东思想武装头脑，发扬不断革命精神，为夺取明年农业更大的丰收创造条件
    据新华社八日讯　全国各地农村广大贫下中农和革命干部，以“斗私，批修”为纲，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，发扬不断革命的精神，掀起了以冬修水利为中心的农田基本建设新高潮，为夺取明年农业生产的更大丰收创造条件。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把亿万贫下中农充分地发动起来了，战无不胜的毛泽东思想进一步深入人心。随着广大贫下中农和革命干部的思想不断革命化，农村无产阶级文化大革命形势和生产建设形势一片大好，越来越好。今年农业生产又夺得了连续第六年的好收成。农田基本建设的大发展，对全国各地夺取今年农业大丰收起了重大作用。据有关部门统计，河北、黑龙江、山东、河南等十七个省区，今年以来增加的灌溉面积、修建的机电排灌设备和新打的机井，是一九六一年以来完成最多最好的一年；台田、条田和各式梯田的面积，都有较大的增加。
    广大贫下中农和革命干部通过今年的生产实践，进一步体会到毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大意义，决心在今冬明春继续狠抓革命，猛促生产，开展农田基本建设，为无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设作出新的贡献。
    为了更好地开展农田基本建设工作，绝大多数省、市、自治区的有关部门，都分别召开了农田基本建设会议，对今冬明春的农田基本建设工作做出了具体的安排，加强了领导。许多地区已掀起农田基本建设高潮。山东全省贫下中农和革命干部，决心以治山治水获得巨大成绩的莒南县厉家寨人为榜样，进一步开展农田基本建设，治理穷山恶水。目前开赴红卫河和徒骇河工地的已达五十多万人，工程的进度较快。河北海河水利工程上工人数达二十六万多人。他们决心再经过一个冬春，争取基本完成根治海河的工程任务。满怀革命豪情的黑龙江省肇东县的广大贫下中农和革命干部目前也在抓紧冻前的大好时机，掀起农田基本建设高潮。现在，全县已完成工程土方一百八十一万立米，打出“三用井”七十七眼，造林二万一千亩。
    在今年的冬修水利活动中，各地都本着“大寨精神，小型为主，全面配套，狠抓管理，更好地为农业增产服务”的方针，在有计划有重点地修建大型农田水利工程的同时，广泛发动群众，集中精力大搞以小型水利为主的农田基本建设。北方大部分地区正在抓紧打井、掏泉，截流引水，平整土地，积极兴建台田、条田和方田。西部黄土高原正在兴修水土保持工程，大修梯田和坝地。南方各地一部分常遭水灾、台风侵袭的地区，主要是继续修建防涝、防风设施；一部分多旱地区，则着重修建蓄水、引水、提水工程，同时进行园田建设。
