Albanian newspapers and people in various regions held rallies to warmly celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, the Tirana Trade Union Council and the Albania-Africa-Asia Solidarity Committee held a mass rally on the 20th to warmly celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and to congratulate the South Vietnamese people on their glorious victories in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Attendees included the General Secretary of the Albanian Trade Union Central Council, Tonin Jakova, the Minister of Education and Culture, Shovma Djana, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Rez Malile, the Chairman of the Albanian Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee, Mistre Treska, and the Chairman of the Albania-Africa-Asia Solidarity Committee, Shefqet Musaraj, among others.

Vietnamese Ambassador to Albania, Nguyen Van Hung, also attended the rally.

Writer Ismail Kadare spoke at the rally. He said: The Vietnamese workers and people have set a brilliant example for all revolutionary people around the world who are fighting against American imperialism through their heroic struggle. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people has won the sympathy, admiration, and enthusiastic support of the Albanian people and all freedom-loving people around the world. We regard the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people as our own struggle, their just cause as our own cause, and their victories as our victories and the victories of all the forces in the powerful anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist front.

Kadare, in his speech, exposed and condemned the struggles of American imperialists to escape their predicament in Vietnam and the treacherous dealings of Soviet revisionists in helping American imperialists to force the Vietnamese people to accept "peace talks."

Ambassador Nguyen Van Hung also spoke at the rally. He said: Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian Party of Labor, the government of the People's Republic of Albania, and the Albanian people have given and will continue to give sincere support to our people. This support and aid are a great encouragement to us. Ambassador Nguyen Van Hung, on behalf of the Vietnamese people, expressed his gratitude for this precious support and aid.

Young volunteers at the Logoreci-Fieri railway construction site, as well as in Kukes, Shkodra, Korca, and Gjirokastra regions, also held rallies to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, the Albanian newspapers "Zëri i Popullit" and "Bashkimi" both published editorials on the 20th to warmly celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The editorial in "Zëri i Popullit" stated that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the true representative of the South Vietnamese people. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is holding high the banner of people's war, aiming to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately unite the country. The article pointed out: The American aggressors have fallen into the iron grip of the people's war in South Vietnam and are in a state of panic and confusion. Currently, on all fronts, the initiative is in the hands of the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people. Vietnam has become the graveyard of the American aggressors, completely shattering the myth of the invincibility of American imperialism.

The article further emphasized that whether it is the "escalation" of American aggression or the open betrayal of Soviet revisionists, they cannot conquer the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to fight to victory.

The article concluded by expressing that the Albanian people, the Albanian Party, and the government regard the liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle and as a great contribution to the revolutionary and socialist cause. Albania will forever stand firmly with the heroic Vietnamese people in the fight.

The editorial in "Bashkimi" stated that the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is one of the greatest victories of the heroic South Vietnamese people in their struggle; it has given the South Vietnamese people the best leaders and organizers in their struggle for freedom and independence. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is leading the South Vietnamese people from victory to victory in their struggle against American aggression and its puppets.

    文章接着强调说，不管是美国侵略的“升级”，还是苏联修正主义者公开的背叛，都不能征服英雄的越南人民的钢铁般的意志和战斗到胜利的决心。
    文章最后表示：阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚党和政府把越南人民的解放斗争看作是自己的斗争，看作是对革命和社会主义事业的伟大贡献。阿尔巴尼亚永远紧密地同英雄的越南人民战斗在一起。
