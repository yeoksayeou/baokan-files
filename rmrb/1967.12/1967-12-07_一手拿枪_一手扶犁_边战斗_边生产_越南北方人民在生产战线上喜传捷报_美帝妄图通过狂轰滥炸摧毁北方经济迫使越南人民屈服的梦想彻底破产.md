The people of North Vietnam, who have been fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle for more than two years, have not only shattered the "air superiority" boasted by American imperialism in the military arena but have also, on the agricultural and industrial production fronts, overcome the mad destruction of the American aggressors and achieved tremendous victories, thus powerfully supporting the war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation.

Since the American imperialists launched large-scale barbaric bombing raids on North Vietnam in 1965, the farmers of North Vietnam, who have embarked on the path of cooperation, have displayed a fearless revolutionary spirit, holding a plow in one hand and a gun in the other, fighting and producing simultaneously, and continuously promoting agricultural development. In 1965, the total agricultural output in the North exceeded that of 1964 and increased by 21.2 percent over 1960. That year, seven counties, 162 communes, and 168 agricultural cooperatives in the entire North achieved the goal of producing five tons of rice per hectare. In 1966, the number of regions and units achieving this goal increased to one province, 15 counties, 273 communes, and more than 1,000 agricultural cooperatives. In 1967, the farmers of the North advanced to new victories and achieved a bumper harvest of early rice. In the Red River Delta, including the entire Thua Thien Province and six counties of Nam Dinh Province, as well as one county of Ninh Binh Province, the yield per hectare reached 2.4 to 2.5 tons. From Hai Duong, Hung Yen, and other provinces to the suburbs of Hanoi, early rice achieved the best harvest in seven or eight years. The provinces of Quang Binh and Vinh Linh, which are on the front lines of the anti-American struggle, also achieved the best harvest in history. In addition, various grains and economic crops also had bumper harvests, with many crops increasing over previous years.

The broad masses of farmers in North Vietnam, in order to achieve victory on the agricultural front, have fought tenaciously against the American aggressors and natural disasters. Every kilogram of rice they harvest sparkles with revolutionary heroism and embodies the iron will of the Vietnamese people to decisively defeat American imperialism. During these two years, the American imperialists have been bombing North Vietnam day and night, and almost every field and village has been bombed. Many farmlands have been hit by tons of bombs, and some villages have been bombed by enemy planes hundreds of times. However, the heroic people of the North, in response to the great battle call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, have put forward the heroic slogan of "increasing production on the bomb craters left by the enemy," and with a spirit of decisive battle and victory over the American aggressors, they have carried out production. The more the enemy destroys, the more resolutely they defend and develop production. At the same time, they have overcome various natural disasters and, under difficult conditions, actively carried out basic agricultural construction and improved agricultural technology. Therefore, they have continuously achieved good harvests.

North Vietnam's industrial production has also achieved great results. To adapt to the war environment, workers in various provinces and cities have displayed a spirit of self-reliance and vigorously developed local industries. In addition to the expansion of many existing local factories and enterprises, according to incomplete statistics, nearly 300 new local factories and enterprises have been built and put into production. The machinery manufacturing industry has developed rapidly. Currently, in almost every province, city, and county, as well as in many communes, machine factories have been established.

Local industries in various places have, over the past two years, actively implemented the policy of serving agricultural production, the anti-American struggle, and the people's livelihood, vigorously tapping potential, and fully and reasonably utilizing local resources to provide more and more products for the country. In 1966, the value of agricultural materials provided by North Vietnam's local industries to agriculture increased by 44.7 percent over 1965, and the value of materials provided to the transportation industry increased by 72.3 percent. Various small, simple machines, electric motors, various boats, improved tools, and agricultural implements produced by local industries increased by two to three times over 1965. The production of cement, fertilizer, pesticides, paper, medicine, sugar, cotton cloth, ceramics, soap, cigarettes, and other products is also increasing day by day.

The great achievements of the people of North Vietnam on the production front are a heavy blow to the American aggressors. The American imperialists have vainly attempted to destroy the North's economy through mad bombing raids and thus force the Vietnamese people to surrender to the invaders. However, in the face of the resolute and tenacious struggle of the heroic people of the North, the American aggressors' dreams have been completely shattered.

Great Leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, and it is completely unbreakable." The great victories achieved by the people of North Vietnam on the production front once again vividly prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment. No matter what brutal means and vicious plots the American imperialists adopt, they cannot stop the people of North Vietnam from advancing from victory to victory.

The heroic people of North Vietnam, while fiercely striking back at the invading American air pirates, have, despite the enemy's mad bombing raids, persisted in production and achieved bumper harvests. The picture shows farmers from a commune in the suburbs of Hanoi returning from harvest.

    一手拿枪　一手扶犁　边战斗　边生产
    越南北方人民在生产战线上喜传捷报
    美帝妄图通过狂轰滥炸摧毁北方经济迫使越南人民屈服的梦想彻底破产
    新华社河内四日电　本社记者报道：两年多以来，战斗在反美斗争前线的越南北方人民，不仅在军事战线上粉碎了美帝国主义吹嘘的“空中优势”，而且在农业和工业生产战线上，战胜了美国强盗的疯狂破坏，取得了巨大胜利，有力地支援了抗美救国战争。
    自从一九六五年美帝国主义对越南北方进行大规模的野蛮轰炸以来，走上合作化道路的越南北方农民，高度发扬大无畏的革命精神，一手扶犁、一手拿枪，边战斗、边生产，不断促进农业生产的发展。一九六五年，北方农业总产量超过了一九六四年，比一九六○年增长百分之二十一点二。这一年，全北方有七个县、一百六十二个乡和一百六十八个农业社达到公顷产量五吨稻谷的奋斗目标。一九六六年，达到这个目标的地区和单位，已增加到一个省、十五个县、二百七十三个乡和一千多个农业社。一九六七年，北方农民乘胜前进，又取得了早稻丰收。在红河三角洲，包括整个太平省和南河省的六个县以及宁平省一个县的面积，公顷产量达到二点四至二点五吨。从海阳、兴安等省到河内市郊一带，早稻取得了七、八年来最好的收成。处在抗美战斗前哨的广平省和永灵区，也取得了历年来最好的收成。此外，杂粮也获得丰收，许多经济作物都比往年增产。
    越南北方广大农民为了夺取农业战线上的胜利，同美国强盗和自然灾害进行了顽强的搏斗。他们收获的每一公斤稻谷，都闪烁着革命英雄主义的火花，凝聚着越南人民坚决打败美帝国主义的钢铁意志。在这两年多期间，美帝国主义夜以继日地对北方进行狂轰滥炸，许多地区几乎没有一块田地和一个村庄没有被轰炸过。不少农田甚至被投下数以吨计的炸弹，有些村庄遭到敌机上百次反复不断的轰炸。但是，英雄的北方人民，坚决响应胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召，提出“要在敌人炸弹坑上提高产量”的豪迈口号，以决战决胜美国强盗的革命精神进行生产。敌人越是疯狂地破坏，他们就越坚决地保卫生产和发展生产。与此同时，他们战胜各种自然灾害，在困难的条件下，积极进行农田基本建设和改进农业技术。因此，不断夺得好收成。
    越南北方的工业生产也取得很大成绩。为适应战争环境，各省市工人发扬自力更生精神，大力发展地方工业。除了原有的许多地方工厂、企业得到扩建外，据不完全的统计，还有将近三百个新的地方工厂企业建成投入生产。机器制造业更有了迅速的发展。目前，在所有省、市和几乎所有的县以及不少的乡，都建立了机器厂。
    各地地方工业两年多来积极贯彻为农业生产、为抗美战斗和为人民生活服务的方针，大力挖掘潜力，充分、合理地利用当地的资源，为国家提供了越来越多的产品。一九六六年，北方地方工业向农业提供的农用物资的产值比一九六五年增加了百分之四十四点七，向交通运输业提供的物资的产值增加了百分之七十二点三。由地方工业生产的各种小型、简易机器，电动机，各种船只，改良工具、农具等产品都比一九六五年增加二至三倍。水泥、肥料、农药、纸张、医药、糖、棉布、陶器、肥皂、纸烟等产品产量也日益增加。
    越南北方人民在生产战线上取得的巨大成就，是对美国强盗的沉重打击。美帝国主义妄想通过狂轰滥炸摧毁北方的经济，从而迫使越南人民向侵略者屈膝投降。但是，在英雄的北方人民坚决、顽强的斗争面前，美国强盗的梦想彻底破灭了。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。”越南北方人民在生产战线上取得的巨大胜利，再一次生动地证明了毛主席这一英明论断的正确。不管美帝国主义采取怎样残暴的手段和恶毒的阴谋，都无法阻挡越南北方人民从胜利走向新的胜利。
    英雄的越南北方人民，在痛击来犯美国空中强盗的同时，不顾敌人的狂轰滥炸，坚持生产，获得丰收。图为河内郊区农业社社员收获归来。
