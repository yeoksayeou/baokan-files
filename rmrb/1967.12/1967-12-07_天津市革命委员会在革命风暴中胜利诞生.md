Under the warm care and the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee triumphantly emerged from the storm of revolution. The sunrise reddened the waters of the Haihe River, and victory songs echoed across the Bohai Gulf. Twenty-five million soldiers and civilians enthusiastically held a celebration rally. The rally passed a telegram of tribute to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Representatives of the revolutionary masses spoke, expressing their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self" as the key link, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and to contribute the greatest efforts to the continuous consolidation and strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 6 - In the unprecedented favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, under the great encouragement and guidance of the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee was triumphantly born in the storm of class struggle.

Tianjin is the gateway to the capital and has a proletariat that has been tested by time and is full of fighting spirit. Our great leader Chairman Mao has always been deeply concerned about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Tianjin.

The great care of Chairman Mao has given the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Tianjin an immense boost and strength. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the great strategic deployments of Chairman Mao, adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and vigorously promote the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. They fiercely fight and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin, continuously develop and consolidate the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination of revolution, and have achieved decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The birth of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. It declares the complete collapse of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique headed by Wang Xiaotang and Zhang Huaisan, the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Tianjin, and the complete failure of the conspiracy to restore capitalism by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin.

Today, the great motherland's capital gateway, Tianjin, is bathed in sunlight, with red flags flying. Twenty-five million jubilant revolutionary masses and soldiers and officers of the army, navy, and air force, carrying the giant portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao and holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gathered from the Haihe Square in the city center to the Tanggu District by the Bohai Gulf, enthusiastically celebrating the birth of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The celebration rally began with the majestic music of "The East Is Red." When the rally solemnly announced the establishment of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the entire venue erupted in joy, and the spirits of the tens of thousands of people soared. They raised their arms and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Long live, long live, long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

The sunrise reddened the waters of the Haihe River, and victory songs echoed across the Bohai Gulf. The boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the sky over Tianjin. The broad masses of revolutionary proletarians and revolutionary masses in the city, in the happy moment of celebrating the birth of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, wished with their excited red hearts for the eternal health of our great leader Chairman Mao! Eternal health! Eternal health!

The Chinese Khrushchev had once attempted to turn Tianjin into a bridgehead for the restoration of capitalism. Soon after the liberation of Tianjin, at the moment when our revolution was transitioning from the new democratic revolution to the socialist revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev came to Tianjin, advocating "exploitation has merit," glorifying the bourgeoisie, and promoting the restoration of capitalism. The "Peach Garden Experience" of fake "four cleans" and true restoration that he advocated was first thrown out in Tianjin. For many years, the loyal agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Tianjin, Wang Xiaotang and Zhang Huaisan, seized power in Tianjin, fiercely opposing the great Mao Zedong Thought, opposing the Party's general line, and fervently advocating the capitalist road, attempting to impose bourgeois dictatorship on the broad revolutionary masses. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this counter-revolutionary revisionist clique again suppressed the revolutionary masses, deceived the people, and stubbornly promoted the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

"In June, the heavenly soldiers march to eliminate evil, with a ten-thousand-foot rope to capture the rocs." The proletarian revolutionary masses led by the working class in Tianjin, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line of our great leader Chairman Mao, broke out of the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line and finally exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Tianjin Party and seized back the power they had usurped. In this fierce class struggle, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "support the leftist broad masses," firmly carried out the instructions of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin in the "three supports, two militaries" work, achieving great merits.

Now, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin have been defeated and are in complete collapse. The great Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today. The broad revolutionary masses have never been as widely and deeply mobilized as they are in this movement. People's spirits have never been as vigorous as they are now, and the revolutionary situation in the city is unprecedentedly good.

The celebration rally was presided over by Comrade Jiang Feng, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Comrade Jie Xuegong, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the rally. After reviewing and summarizing the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Tianjin over the past year and a half, he said that through the sharp and complex struggle of the past eighteen months, after experiencing many twists and turns in the battle, we have finally achieved decisive victory. The great victories we have achieved fully demonstrate the boundless and invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. He said that the establishment of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee does not mean the end of the revolution, but rather the beginning of a new revolution. Our fundamental task in the future is to further vigorously promote the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, to firmly implement the theories, lines, policies, methods, and policies of Chairman Mao on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Jie Xuegong emphasized that our great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the most outstanding leader of the proletariat, and the greatest genius. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the Party and the country, the fundamental guarantee for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the fundamental guarantee for the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the fundamental guarantee for the eternal prosperity of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and forever loyal to the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. We must firmly implement the instructions of Chairman Mao, sentence by sentence. We must respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin to study and apply Chairman Mao's works extensively, pushing the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

He called on the broad revolutionary proletarians and revolutionary masses in the city to seriously study and firmly implement the latest instructions given by Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, to take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self" as the key link, to fiercely fight against the "self," to transform one's worldview, to fiercely criticize revisionism, to carry out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, to further consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination of revolution, to do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of their own units, to further carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement, to strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, to "grasp revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness," and to do a better job in all aspects.

Jie Xuegong finally said that we must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, be humble and prudent, and continue to advance. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, win new and greater victories, and turn Tianjin into a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

Comrade Zheng Sangeng, a responsible person of the PLA units stationed in Tianjin and Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, spoke on behalf of the soldiers and officers of the army, navy, and air force stationed in Tianjin. He said that the PLA units in Tianjin, following the battle orders of the great commander Chairman Mao, have participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Tianjin for ten months. Ten months of struggle is a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Our soldiers and officers deeply feel that the absolute authority of our great leader Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao are the source of power, the fundamental guarantee, and the lifeline of all our work in the "three supports, two militaries." Our soldiers and officers' boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought have reached a new height. Ten months of struggle is a classroom for class struggle. In this classroom, our soldiers and officers have undergone severe tests and multi-faceted tempering. Ten months of struggle is a classroom for learning from the masses. The broad revolutionary proletarians and revolutionary masses have taught us many things we did not know before. The broad revolutionary proletarians and revolutionary masses are our teachers and at the same time our close comrades-in-arms.

Zheng Sangeng said that we are determined to follow our great leader Chairman Mao, follow Vice Chairman Lin, follow the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and implement the great strategic deployments of Chairman Mao. We will take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self" as the key link, continue to push forward the "three supports, two militaries" work, firmly suppress and smash the conspiracies and sabotage of all class enemies at home and abroad, and defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and fight to the end to complete all the tasks entrusted to us by our great leader Chairman Mao.

Representatives of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres from various units in Tianjin spoke at the rally with revolutionary enthusiasm. They unanimously pointed out that today, we revolutionary proletarians have seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Tianjin Party and established the revolutionary committee, which is only the first step of the ten-thousand-li long march. To consolidate our red political power, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, closely follow the great strategic deployments of Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self" as the key link, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high, learn new levels, and use new levels. We must carry out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, further consolidate the great alliance of revolution, do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of our own units, be determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, be determined to be reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, with the political responsibility of the masters of the state, defend the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, contribute our greatest efforts to the continuous consolidation and strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high forever in Tianjin!

In the stormy applause and cheers, the rally unanimously passed a telegram of tribute to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

After the celebration rally, the Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Jie Xuegong, and Vice Chairmen Xiao Siming, Zheng Sangeng, Jiang Feng, and the members of the Revolutionary Committee held a grand parade with twenty-five million revolutionary masses.

    在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和最新指示引导下
    天津市革命委员会在革命风暴中胜利诞生
    朝阳映红海河水，凯歌响彻渤海湾。二十五万军民热烈举行庆祝大会。大会通过给最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。革命群众代表发言表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以斗私批修为纲，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，为无产阶级专政的不断巩固和加强贡献最大力量
    新华社天津六日电　在全国无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势下，在伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区所作的最新指示的巨大鼓舞和指引下，天津市革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中宣告胜利诞生。
    天津是首都的门户，有久经考验的、富有战斗力的工人阶级。我们的伟大领袖毛主席，一直非常关心天津市的无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    毛主席的伟大关怀，给了天津市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众无比巨大的鼓舞和力量。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，狠斗猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在天津的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，不断发展、巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    天津市革命委员会的诞生，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。它宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫在天津的代理人——以万晓塘、张淮三为首的反革命修正主义集团的彻底垮台，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在天津复辟资本主义阴谋的彻底破产。
    今天，伟大祖国首都的门户天津市阳光普照，红旗招展。二十五万欢腾的革命群众和陆海空三军指战员，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，云集在从市中心的海河广场到渤海边的塘沽区，热烈庆祝天津市革命委员会的诞生。
    庆祝大会在《东方红》的雄壮乐曲声中开始。当大会庄严宣布天津市革命委员会成立的时候，全场欢腾，群情振奋，几十万人振臂高呼：“光焰无际的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    朝阳映红海河水，凯歌响彻渤海湾。毛泽东思想的无际光辉，映红了天津市上空。全市广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众在欢庆天津市革命委员会诞生的幸福时刻，颗颗激动的红心共同祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    中国赫鲁晓夫曾经妄图把天津变成复辟资本主义的桥头堡。天津解放不久，当着我国的革命由新民主主义革命转入社会主义革命的时刻，中国赫鲁晓夫就来到天津，大肆宣扬“剥削有功”，美化资产阶级，大搞资本主义复辟。他所鼓吹的假四清、真复辟的“桃园经验”，也是首先在天津抛出的。多年来中国赫鲁晓夫在天津的忠实代理人万晓塘、张淮三反革命修正主义集团，窃取了天津市的权力，疯狂地反对伟大的毛泽东思想，反对党的总路线，狂热地鼓吹走资本主义道路，妄图对广大革命群众实行资产阶级专政。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这个反革命修正主义集团又镇压革命派，蒙蔽群众，顽固地推行中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线。
    “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”天津市以工人阶级为主体的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中冲杀出来，终于揪出了天津市党内一小撮走资派，并且把他们所窃取的权力夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。在这场激烈的阶级搏斗中，中国人民解放军驻天津陆海空三军指战员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“支持左派广大群众”的教导，在“三支”“两军”工作中，坚决地执行毛主席、林副主席的指示，立下了丰功伟绩。
    现在，中国赫鲁晓夫和他在天津的代理人已经被打得落花流水，全面崩溃。伟大的毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样深入人心，广大革命群众从来没有象这次运动发动得这样广泛和深入，人们的精神面貌从来没有象现在这样意气风发，全市革命形势空前大好。
    庆祝大会由天津市革命委员会副主任江枫同志主持。天津市革命委员会主任解学恭同志在大会上讲了话。他在回顾和总结了天津市一年多来文化大革命的斗争历程后说，经过十八个月来尖锐复杂的斗争，经历了多次反复和曲折的战斗历程，我们终于取得了决定性的胜利。我们所取得的伟大胜利，充分说明了毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线威力无穷，所向无敌。他说，天津市革命委员会的成立，绝不意味着革命的结束，而是革命的新的起点。我们今后的根本任务，就是进一步大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    解学恭强调指出，我们伟大领袖毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。伟大的毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是全党全国一切工作的指导方针，是取得无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的根本保证，是巩固无产阶级专政的根本保证，是无产阶级革命事业千秋万代永不变色的根本保证。我们一定要永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，永远忠于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，对毛主席的指示，坚决照办，句句照办。我们一定要响应林副主席的号召，大学大用毛主席著作，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段。
    他号召全市广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，一定要认真学习、坚决执行毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的一系列的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗“私”字，改造世界观，狠批修正主义，广泛深入地开展革命大批判，进一步巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改，进一步开展“拥军爱民”运动，加强和巩固无产阶级专政，“抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好”。
    解学恭最后说，我们一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，继续前进。让我们更高更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓做把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，夺取新的更大的胜利，把天津市办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
    中国人民解放军驻天津部队负责人、天津市革命委员会副主任郑三生同志，代表驻天津的陆海空三军指战员，在大会上讲话。他说，中国人民解放军驻天津陆海空三军，遵照伟大统帅毛主席的战斗号令，介入天津市的文化大革命，已经十个月了。十个月的斗争，是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂。我军指战员深深体会到，伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，毛主席无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，是做好“三支”“两军”工作的力量源泉，根本保证，是我们一切工作的生命线。我军指战员对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜和无限忠诚，达到了新的高度。十个月的斗争，是阶级斗争的大课堂。在这个课堂里，我军指战员经受了严峻的考验和多方面的锻炼。十个月的斗争，是向人民群众学习的大课堂。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，教我们学会了许多我们以前所不会的东西。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，是我们的先生，同时又是我们的亲密战友。
    郑三生说，我们决心紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟林副主席，紧跟党中央、中央军委和中央文革小组，遵照毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把“三支”“两军”工作继续推向前进，坚决镇压、坚决粉碎国内外一切阶级敌人的阴谋破坏和捣乱，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线，誓死保卫无产阶级文化大革命，为完成伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的一切任务而战斗到底。
    天津市的工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和机关革命干部的代表，满怀革命的豪情在大会上发言。他们一致指出，今天我们无产阶级革命派夺了天津市党内一小撮走资派的权，建立了革命委员会，只是万里长征走完了第一步。要巩固我们的红色政权，必须更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮，学出新水平，用出新水平。要广泛深入地开展革命大批判，进一步地巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位的斗批改，誓做把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，誓做无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人，以国家主人翁的政治责任感，保卫天津市革命委员会，为无产阶级专政的不断巩固和加强贡献自己的最大力量，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想伟大红旗在天津千秋万代高高飘扬！
    在暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼声中，大会一致通过了给最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    庆祝大会以后，天津市革命委员会主任解学恭，副主任萧思明、郑三生、江枫和革命委员会的委员们，同二十五万革命群众一起举行了盛大的游行。（附图片）
