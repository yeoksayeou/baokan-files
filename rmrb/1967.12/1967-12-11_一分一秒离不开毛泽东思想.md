Fish cannot live without water, melons cannot grow without vines, and revolutionary soldiers cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought for a single moment.

Chen Tiankui, a son of a poor peasant, harbors a deep hatred for the old society, boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, and profound class feelings for Mao Zedong Thought. Upon enlisting, he had a strong desire: how wonderful it would be to own a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"! However, the top handful of capitalist roaders within the Party were extremely fearful of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and went to great lengths to obstruct the publication and distribution of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," making it impossible for Chen Tiankui's wish to be fulfilled for a long time.

A thunderous roar echoed, and the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began in full swing. The broad revolutionary masses exposed the crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. The Party Central Committee made a wise decision in the latter half of last year to publish and distribute "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in large quantities. The People's Daily also published an editorial titled "A Great Joy for the People of the Whole Nation." When Chen Tiankui heard this great news on the radio, he jumped up in joy, tears welling up in his eyes, and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!"

From then on, Chen Tiankui went everywhere to inquire about how to buy the revolutionary treasure more quickly. When he heard that the mail-order department of the Beijing Xinhua Bookstore could meet the demand, he wrote a letter to Beijing that very night. After sending the letter, Chen Tiankui went to ask the mailman every day after breakfast if there was any mail from Beijing for him. Someone said, "Don't be impatient, the letter might not have arrived yet!" He, however, said, "Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary treasures, and we revolutionary soldiers cannot do without them for a single moment. Reading Chairman Mao's books as soon as possible is my greatest wish."

During the time when "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" had not yet been mailed, he sent two more letters to inquire. These two letters, every word and sentence, shone with his deep feelings for Chairman Mao's works, leaped with his boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and expressed the common wish of millions of revolutionary soldiers.

The revolutionary treasure was sent from the center of the world revolution, Beijing, to the platoon. Chen Tiankui and his comrades-in-arms cheered and jumped for joy, holding the treasure and swearing to Chairman Mao: We will definitely master your brilliant thoughts.

　　鱼儿离不开水，瓜儿离不开秧，革命战士
　　一分一秒离不开毛泽东思想
    陈佃奎这个贫农的儿子，对旧社会有刻骨的仇，对我们伟大领袖毛主席有无限的爱，对毛泽东思想有着深厚的阶级感情。他一入伍，就有一个强烈的愿望：能买到一套《毛泽东选集》多好啊！可是党内最大的一小撮走资派，万分害怕广大工农兵群众掌握光焰无际的毛泽东思想，千方百计阻挠《毛泽东选集》的出版、发行，使陈佃奎同志的愿望久久不能实现。
    一声春雷，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地开始了。广大革命群众揭发了党内一小撮走资派的罪行。党中央在去年下半年作出英明的决定，要大量出版、发行《毛泽东选集》。《人民日报》还发了《全国人民的大喜事》的社论。陈佃奎从广播里听到这个特大喜讯时，高兴得跳起来，热泪盈眶，高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    从此，陈佃奎同志到处打听怎样才能更快一点买到革命宝书。当听说北京新华书店邮购部可以满足要求时，他连夜给北京写信。信发走了，陈佃奎同志每天吃过早饭都去问一问通信员，是不是有从北京给他发来的邮件。有人说：“不要心急，信可能还没有到呢！”他却说：“毛主席的书是革命的宝，咱革命战士一分一秒离不了。早读到毛主席的书，是我最大的心愿。”
    在《毛泽东选集》还没邮来的时间里，他一连发了两封信去催问。这两封信，每个字每句话都闪耀着他对毛主席著作的深厚感情，都跳跃着他无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的红心，都表达着亿万革命战士共同的心愿。
    革命的宝书，从世界革命中心北京寄到了连队，陈佃奎和他的战友们欢呼跳跃，手捧宝书向毛主席宣誓：我们一定要把您的光辉思想真正学到手。
