    The No. 1 Preparation Workshop of Jiangxi Cotton Textile and Dyeing Factory, under the guidance of the "Leftist and People-Loving Model Squad," has organized extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The classes focus on "criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself," using the "Old Five Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as weapons. They link the study to the realities of the Cultural Revolution and the workshop's own situation, combining study, self-examination, criticism, and action, achieving immediate results and initially forming a revolutionary learning atmosphere.

    After Chairman Mao issued the call to "criticize revisionism and repudiate oneself," the workshop, with the help of the Heroic Fourth Squad, immediately organized the first session of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which included revolutionary rebel cadres and revolutionary cadres. This session focused on resolving the issue of some comrades not wanting to be cadres. Subsequently, the workshop organized various types of study classes for rebels, deceived masses, party members, and rebels, as well as cadres. After Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "military study classes should include soldiers," the workshop organized new and old cadre study classes that included rebel soldiers. To date, they have organized eleven sessions of study classes.

    The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in this workshop have two major characteristics:

    First, they combine theory with practice, addressing problems as they arise. They actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, taking the Heroic Fourth Squad and Li Wenzhong as examples, learning and applying immediately, achieving immediate results. For instance, some rebels could not correctly treat the deceived masses, and the deceived masses were also dissatisfied with the rebels, affecting unity. To address this, they organized study classes for rebels and deceived masses together. In the classes, they criticized revisionism and repudiated themselves, conducting self-criticism, educating themselves, and resolving conflicts. Even those who had not spoken for a long time began to speak. Mutual understanding increased, relationships improved, and production was promoted.

    Second, they combine criticizing revisionism with repudiating oneself, closely linking study with the factory's reality. For example, when studying the "Old Three Articles," they examined whether they were like the Heroic Fourth Squad and Li Wenzhong, truly doing as Chairman Mao said, wholeheartedly serving the people. Through self-examination, many comrades realized that in the past, they had worked for "percentage competitions," thinking about bonuses, and had not studied Chairman Mao's works well, failing to prioritize politics. This was influenced by the revisionist material incentives and bonus policies of China's Khrushchev. Thus, they directed their hatred towards China's Khrushchev. They criticized and denounced China's Khrushchev and his agents' revisionist management policies. The more they criticized, the more they hated revisionism and saw the harm of "self." Many comrades further realized that to criticize revisionism, one must repudiate oneself. If one does not overthrow and expose the "self" in one's mind, even if the revisionist management policies are criticized and overturned now, one might become a revisionist in the future. Therefore, in the study classes, everyone combined criticizing revisionism with repudiating oneself, greatly arousing hatred towards "self" and significantly enhancing self-revolutionary consciousness.

    Through organizing extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the self-awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses of workers has greatly improved. Everyone combines study with practice, learning and applying immediately, achieving immediate results. Through study, the ideological awareness of the broad masses of workers continuously improves, strengthening their sense of responsibility as masters of the state. Everyone firmly guards their production posts, enhancing revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. Good deeds and good people continuously emerge, and the revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better, forming a new situation of grasping the revolution and promoting production.

### 活学活用毛主席著作联系实际立竿见影

    江西棉纺织印染厂一准备车间边学习边对照边批判边行动
    活学活用毛主席著作联系实际立竿见影
    通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，学习英雄四排和李文忠同志的英雄榜样，认真斗私批修，职工思想觉悟不断提高，好人好事不断出现
    本报讯　江西棉纺织印染厂一准备车间，在“支左爱民模范排”帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班。学习班以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老五篇”和毛主席的最新指示为武器，联系文化大革命的实际，联系本人和本厂的实际，边学习，边对照，边批判，边行动，收到了立竿见影的效果，初步形成了革命的好学风。
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，这个车间在英雄四排的帮助下，闻风而动，立即举办了有革命造反派骨干和革命干部参加的第一期毛泽东思想学习班。这一期学习班着重解决了一些同志不愿当干部的思想问题。接着，这个车间举办了造反派和受蒙蔽群众、党员和造反派、干部一起参加的各种类型的学习班。毛主席发出“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的最新指示以后，这个车间又办了有造反派战士参加的新老干部学习班。到目前为止，他们已举办了十一期学习班。
    这个车间的毛泽东思想学习班有两大特点：
    第一，理论联系实际，带着问题办。他们活学活用毛主席著作，以英雄四排和李文忠为榜样，学了就用，立竿见影。如有的造反派不能正确地对待受蒙蔽的群众，受蒙蔽群众也对造反派不服气，影响了团结。针对这种情况，他们就办造反派和受蒙蔽群众一起参加的学习班。在学习班上斗私批修，各自多做自我批评，自己教育自己，从而解决了他们之间的矛盾。连长期不说话的同志，通过斗私批修，也都说话了。互相增进了团结，改善了关系，促进了生产。
    第二，斗私和批修相结合，即把学习同工厂的实际密切结合起来。如学习“老三篇”，就检查自己是否象英雄四排和李文忠那样，真正做到了毛主席怎么说，自己就怎么做，全心全意为人民。通过检查，很多同志认识到，过去自己在劳动中为了“百分赛”，想到拿奖金，没有很好地学习毛主席著作，没有突出政治，这是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义物质刺激、奖金挂帅的毒。于是，大家把仇恨集中到中国的赫鲁晓夫身上。他们口诛笔伐，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人推行的修正主义办厂路线。大家越批越感到修正主义的可恨，越批越感到“私”字的害处。很多同志还进一步认识到，要批修必须斗私。如果不把自己头脑里的“私”字斗倒斗臭，即使现在把修正主义办厂路线批倒批臭了，将来自己还会变修。因此，只有斗私，才能保证今后不变修。所以，在学习班里，大家边斗私，边批修，斗私和批修相结合，大大激起了对“私”字的仇恨，大大提高了自我革命的自觉性。
    通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，广大职工学习毛主席著作的自觉性大大提高。大家在学习中密切联系本人和本厂的实际，学用结合，学了就用，立竿见影。通过学习，广大职工的思想觉悟不断提高，增强了国家主人翁的责任感，人人坚守生产岗位，加强了革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。好人好事不断出现，革命和生产形势越来越好，一个抓革命、促生产的新局面正在形成。
