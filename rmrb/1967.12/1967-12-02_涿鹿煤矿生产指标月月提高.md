The revolutionary workers of the Zhuolu Coal Mine in Hebei Province, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have firmly grasped the revolutionary struggle's overall direction, earnestly adhered to the principles of revolutionizing on the spot, revolutionizing in one's spare time, and revolutionizing through thrift. The entire mine is now in a state of great revolutionary and production momentum. This year, the mine's original coal production plan has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. Various production indicators have steadily risen month by month, reaching the highest level since the mine's establishment. Currently, all revolutionary workers in the mine are striving to achieve even greater victories in both revolution and production. Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine, the revolutionary workers of Zhuolu Coal Mine have insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and prior to everything. They have taken "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key task, and have focused on the ideological transformation of the people.
