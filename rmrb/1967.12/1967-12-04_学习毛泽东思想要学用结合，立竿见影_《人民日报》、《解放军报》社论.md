The great helmsman guides the ship through the vast sea, and Mao Zedong Thought guides the revolution.

Our great leader Mao Zedong's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, wrote an inscription for the National Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works in the Navy, which greatly inspired the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the country. It urged them to follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao closely and, in the practical struggle of the Cultural Revolution, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

The communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The method of studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong by bringing problems to the study, learning actively and applying actively, combining learning with application, learning what is urgently needed first, seeing immediate results, and focusing on application, is effective and universally applicable, and should be further promoted throughout the Party and the country."

Studying Mao Zedong Thought must see immediate results. That is to say, one must use Mao Zedong Thought as an arrow to hit the target of current revolutionary practice.

The combination of theory and practice is one of the three fine traditions of our Party. If you want to be a thorough revolutionary, you must ensure that theory and practice are consistent; if you are a revolutionary in words only, theory and practice will inevitably be separated.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it. The purpose of mastering it is entirely for application."

After studying Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions from Chairman Mao, one must apply them, see immediate results, and act decisively. One must link them to one's own reality, the reality of one's unit, and the reality of society, and firmly, comprehensively, and unconditionally carry them out.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, should strive to follow every word and instruction from Chairman Mao, deeply understand them, link them to reality, and carry them out to the letter. This is a full expression of one's boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

After studying Chairman Mao's works, whether to apply them or not; after studying the latest instructions from Chairman Mao, whether to carry them out or not, is a matter of class feelings and fundamental attitudes towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Of course, application is a process of improvement. However, a true proletarian revolutionary always focuses on application, learns a little and applies a little, combines learning with application, sees immediate results, and constantly transforms oneself. Such a comrade is a true revolutionary.

Some people's words and deeds are inconsistent; they agree in words but do something else in action; they speak beautifully in meetings but do not act accordingly afterwards; or even use a pragmatic attitude, take things out of context, and take what they need for their petty-bourgeois factional interests. This attitude is completely wrong.

Such inconsistency between words and deeds, as Chairman Mao pointed out more than twenty years ago, "They talk about 'linking up' every day, but in fact, they talk about 'separation,' because they do not go about linking up," "If one only talks about linking up in words but does not carry it out in action, then talking for a hundred years is still of no use."

To apply, to solve problems, is to fight against selfishness and to criticize revisionism.

Everyone should bring their active thoughts on revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units to the height of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines, and fight against selfishness. By overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism, one can study Mao Zedong Thought and see immediate results.

    学习毛泽东思想要学用结合，立竿见影
    《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席为人民解放军海军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的题词，极大地鼓舞了全国亿万军民，勉励他们紧跟伟大舵手毛主席，在文化大革命的斗争实践中，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想。
    党的八届十一中全会公报指出：“对毛泽东同志著作，带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫的方法，是行之有效的，普遍适用的，应当进一步在全党全国推广。”
    学习毛泽东思想，一定要立竿见影。就是说，要用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射当前革命斗争实践之“的”。
    理论和实际相结合，是我党的三大优良作风之一。你要做一个完全的革命派，就必须理论和实际一致；你是一个口头革命派，就必然理论和实际分离。
    毛主席一再教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”
    学了毛主席著作，学了毛主席的最新指示，就要用，要立竿见影，要雷厉风行地见之于行动。要联系自己的实际、本单位的实际、社会的实际，坚决地、全面地、不折不扣地贯彻执行。
    广大工农兵群众，红卫兵小将，革命干部和革命知识分子，对于毛主席的每句话，每个指示，都应该努力紧跟，深刻领会，联系实际，句句照办。这样，就是充分体现了自己对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。
    学了毛主席著作，用，还是不用；学了毛主席的最新指示，执行，还是不执行，这是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的阶级感情问题、根本态度问题。当然，用，有一个提高的过程。但是，一个真正的无产阶级革命者，总是在用字上狠下功夫，学一点就用一点，学用结合，立竿见影，不断地改造自己。这样的同志，就是一个真正的革命派。
    有的人言行不一致，口头上说同意，行动上却另搞一套；会上讲的漂亮，会后又不那样去做；甚至用实用主义的态度，断章取义，各取所需，为自己的小资产阶级派性服务。这种态度是完全错误的。
    这种言行不一致的情况，正如毛主席在二十多年前指出的，“他们天天讲‘联系’，实际上却是讲‘隔离’，因为他们并不去联系”，“如果只是口头上讲联系，行动上又不实行联系，那末，讲一百年也还是无益的。”
    要用，要解决问题，就是要斗私，要批修。
    大家要带着革命大批判、革命大联合、革命三结合、进行本单位斗批改等方面的活思想，提到两个阶级、两条路线斗争的高度去斗私。把资产阶级的“私”斗下去，把小资产阶级派性克服下去，学习毛泽东思想，就能够立竿见影。
