In the face of the surging tide of the African national liberation movement, the decaying British imperialism, Portuguese colonialism, and white racist forces, supported by American imperialism, are making desperate struggles in southern Africa to maintain their colonial rule and establish a so-called "white man's Africa" region. However, their evil plots are being struck down by the armed African revolutionary people and the increasingly fierce denunciations of the awakened people of various African countries.

Currently, in southern Africa, the countries still under the direct rule of imperialism and colonialism and not yet independent are: Portugal's colonies Angola and Mozambique, Britain's colony Swaziland, British-controlled Southern Rhodesia, the colonial regime of white racists in South Africa, and South West Africa occupied by the South African colonial regime. The overall backer of the imperialist and colonialist forces ruling these countries is the evil American imperialism. To maintain and expand its colonial interests, American imperialism is using various means to support the colonial regimes in southern Africa.

To defend their remaining strongholds in southern Africa, the imperialist and colonialist forces have intensified their suppression of the people there. With the strong support of American imperialism and other NATO countries, the Portuguese colonial authorities have repeatedly sent more colonial troops, increasing severalfold over the past few years. Now, Portugal has over 80,000 colonial troops in Angola and over 55,000 in Mozambique. The South African colonial authorities are more brutally using the fascist "terrorism act" to arrest African nationalists and to arm all white colonial farmers to shoot or arrest any "suspicious Africans" entering their estates. The Southern Rhodesian colonial authorities have also intensified the arrest and persecution of Africans, sentencing 82 African nationalists to death in August.

These colonial regimes feel increasingly unable to stop the surging tide of the national liberation movement on their own, so they are tightening their collaboration, forming a new counter-revolutionary "white (colonialist) alliance" to resist. According to Western news agencies, the main members of this criminal "alliance" are the white colonial regimes of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, as well as the Portuguese colonialists. This year, the regimes belonging to this "alliance" have been increasingly collaborating politically, militarily, and economically.

The political goal of the collaboration between the South African, Southern Rhodesian, and Portuguese colonialists is to maintain their criminal colonial rule and preserve a "white man's Africa" region. According to the Tanzanian newspaper *Uhuru*, "The white fascists in southern Africa are colluding with imperialists worldwide to implement a grand plan to draw a horizontal line across the African continent, openly or secretly striving to place the entire East Africa, Central Africa, and southern Africa under white hegemony." These colonialist forces, under the impact of the national liberation movement, are in a state of panic and mutual support. The white racist regime in South Africa supports the illegal "independence" of the white colonial regime in Southern Rhodesia, which is strongly opposed by all African people. The Southern Rhodesian colonial regime supports South Africa's intensified racial discrimination policies, while South Africa and Southern Rhodesia both support the Portuguese colonial authorities in their intensified brutal suppression of the national independence movements in Angola and Mozambique. They attempt to build a "dam" in the lands of Angola, Mozambique, and Southern Rhodesia to block the surging tide of the national liberation movement. South African Prime Minister Vorster and Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Smith held a "completely secret" meeting on October 21. Before this, Portuguese Foreign Minister Nogueira had secretly visited South Africa for five days of talks.

Militarily, they are openly colluding to jointly suppress the African people's national democratic movements. The South African colonial authorities have sent troops into Southern Rhodesia twice this year, the first time with over 500 troops and the second time with 320; they also sent fascist police, prison guards, armored vehicles, and reconnaissance planes into Southern Rhodesia to join the Smith regime in suppressing the patriotic armed struggle of the people of Zimbabwe. South African Prime Minister Vorster recently brazenly declared, "Wherever it is allowed for the South African colonial authorities to suppress African nationalists, 'we will go there to fight.'"

Economically, the colonial regimes of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, and Portugal have signed a series of "agreements."

The number one accomplice of American imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, also continuously uses various means to serve the imperialist and colonialist forces led by the United States. The Soviet revisionists collude politically and economically with these forces and use various open and covert means to sabotage the national liberation movements in southern Africa.

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The world is progressing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone." The situation in southern Africa is exactly like this. The desperate struggles of the imperialist and colonialist forces there cannot change their inevitable doom. Despite Portugal's repeated reinforcement of troops with the support of American imperialism and continuous "encirclement and suppression," the armed struggles in Mozambique and Angola have been burning fiercely for several years and are continuing to deepen. They have broken through hundreds of counter-revolutionary "encirclements," continuously eliminating the enemy's combat effectiveness, and defending the rural bases they have established. Despite the Southern Rhodesian colonial authorities' intensified border closures and brutal suppression, and the South African colonial authorities' dispatch of troops to join the suppression, the people of Zimbabwe, who launched armed struggles last year, are fighting stronger and stronger, continuously striking the enemy, and have already annihilated hundreds of colonial troops. In South West Africa, despite the South African colonial authorities' various attempts to seal the border and carry out brutal searches and persecutions, the African nationalists there have actively launched armed resistance since last August; many patriots abroad, risking arrest and slaughter, have crossed numerous blockade lines to return home to join the fight.

With the widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in Africa, Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and on people's war are increasingly deeply rooted in people's hearts. The armed struggles and national democratic movements of the people in southern Africa are further deepening and surging. This situation has made the imperialists led by the United States extremely panicked. *U.S. News & World Report* exclaimed in September: "Guerrilla warfare now threatens white Africa"; and the British *Observer* admitted in October: "In the entire southern Africa, violent actions have now become the norm."

The great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "To create disorder, fail, create more disorder, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The desperate struggles of the imperialist and colonialist forces in southern Africa at present are merely some disorder before their doom. As long as the awakened people of southern Africa follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao and persist in long-term struggle, they will certainly smash all the disorder created by the imperialists and colonialists led by the United States, making them perish completely in the blazing revolutionary struggle of the revolutionary people.

　　毛泽东思想在非洲广泛传播  人民战争思想日益深入人心
　　非洲南部人民武装斗争和民族解放运动蓬勃发展
　　帝国主义殖民主义势力在美苏支持下作垂死挣扎
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：在汹涌澎湃的非洲民族解放运动怒潮的猛烈冲击面前，腐朽的英帝国主义、葡萄牙殖民主义以及白人种族主义势力，在美帝国主义的支撑下，正在非洲南部进行顽抗和垂死挣扎，妄图在那里保持它们的殖民统治，建立一个所谓的“白人的非洲”地区。但是它们的恶毒阴谋正遭到拿起武器的非洲革命人民的越来越有力的打击，遭到觉醒了的非洲各国人民的越来越激烈的声讨。
    目前在非洲南部，仍然处在帝国主义和殖民主义直接统治下的未独立国家有：葡萄牙的殖民地安哥拉和莫三鼻给，英国的殖民地斯威士兰，英国控制下的南罗得西亚，白人种族主义者的殖民政权统治的南非，以及南非殖民政权霸占的西南非洲。统治这些国家的帝国主义和殖民主义势力的总后台是万恶的美帝国主义。美帝国主义为了维持和扩张它的殖民利益，正在使用各种方式，千方百计地支持在非洲南部的殖民政权。
    帝国主义和殖民主义势力，为了死保它们在非洲南部的几个残余地盘，首先变本加厉地镇压那里的人民。葡萄牙殖民当局在美帝国主义和北大西洋集团其他国家的大力支持下，一再增派殖民军，几年来增加了好几倍，现在它在安哥拉的殖民军已达八万多人，在莫三鼻给达五万五千多人。南非殖民当局正更加穷凶极恶地利用法西斯的“恐怖行动法案”，大肆逮捕非洲民族主义者，并要全南非的白人殖民农场主“武装”起来，对进入他们庄园的一切“可疑的非洲人”开枪或逮捕。南罗得西亚殖民当局也加紧逮捕和迫害非洲人，八月间又判决八十二名非洲民族主义者死刑。
    这些殖民政权越来越感到无法单独阻挡日益高涨的民族解放运动怒潮，于是就加紧互相勾结，结成新的反革命“白人（殖民主义者）同盟”来进行顽抗。据西方通讯社透露，这个罪恶“同盟”的主要成员就是南非和南罗得西亚的白人殖民政权以及葡萄牙殖民主义者。今年以来，属于这个“同盟”的几个政权在政治上、军事上、经济上步步加紧勾结。
    南非、南罗得西亚和葡萄牙的殖民主义者勾结在一起的政治目的就是为了保持它们罪恶的殖民统治，在非洲保持一个“白人的非洲”地区。据坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》揭露，“非洲南部的白人法西斯分子同世界各地的帝国主义者互相勾结订有一个庞大的计划，那就是在非洲大陆拦腰划一条横线，公开或秘密地竭力使整个东非、中非和非洲南部置于白人霸权的统治之下。”这些殖民主义势力在民族解放运动的冲击下，狼狈为奸，互相支持。南非白人种族主义政权支持受到所有非洲人民激烈反对的南罗得西亚白人殖民政权的非法“独立”，南罗得西亚殖民政权支持南非推行的变本加厉的种族歧视政策，而南非和南罗得西亚都支持葡萄牙殖民当局加紧残暴镇压安哥拉和莫三鼻给人民的民族独立运动。它们妄图在安哥拉、莫三鼻给和南罗得西亚的土地上建立一条堵住民族解放运动怒潮的“堤坝”。南非白人殖民政权总理沃斯特和南罗得西亚白人殖民政权总理史密斯曾在十月二十一日举行了“内容绝对保密”的会谈。在这以前，葡萄牙外交部长诺格拉就跑到南非进行五天的秘密会谈。
    在军事上，它们明目张胆地勾结在一起联合镇压非洲人民的民族民主运动。南非殖民当局今年以来曾两次派军队进驻南罗得西亚，第一次派了五百多人，第二次派了三百二十人；另外还派了法西斯警察部队、狱吏，以及装甲车和侦察机进入南罗得西亚，伙同史密斯殖民政权镇压津巴布韦人民的爱国武装斗争。南非总理沃斯特不久前竟猖狂地叫嚷：哪里允许南非殖民当局镇压非洲民族主义者，“我们就到那里去打。”
    在经济上，南非、南罗得西亚和葡萄牙的殖民政权之间签订了一系列“协定”。
    美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏修领导集团，也不断地用各种方式为以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义势力效劳。苏修集团在政治上、经济上同这些势力勾勾搭搭，并且用各种公开和隐蔽的手段破坏非洲南部的民族解放运动。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。”非洲南部的形势也正是这样。帝国主义和殖民主义势力在那里的疯狂挣扎也改变不了它们必将灭亡的总趋势。尽管葡萄牙在美帝国主义支持下一再增兵，不断“围剿”，但是莫三鼻给和安哥拉人民已经坚持了几年的武装斗争烈火，继续在熊熊燃烧，并且在深入发展。他们击破了千百次的反革命“围剿”，不断消灭敌人的有生力量，保卫了已经建立的农村根据地。尽管南罗得西亚殖民当局加紧封锁边界，疯狂镇压，而且南非殖民当局还派兵伙同镇压，但是去年开展了武装斗争的津巴布韦人民，越战越强，不断给予敌人打击，到现在已歼灭数以百计的殖民军。在西南非洲，尽管南非殖民当局千方百计地封锁边境，进行残暴的搜捕和迫害，但是那里的非洲民族主义者从去年八月以来，积极展开武装反抗的斗争；许多在国外的爱国者冒着被逮捕屠杀的危险，越过重重封锁线，纷纷回国参加战斗。
    随着战无不胜的毛泽东思想在非洲的广泛传播，毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”和关于人民战争的光辉思想日益深入人心，非洲南部人民的武装斗争正进一步深入发展，民族民主运动继续蓬勃高涨。这种情况使以美国为首的帝国主义十分惊慌。《美国新闻与世界报道》今年九月惊呼：“游击战现在威胁着白人非洲”；英国《观察家报》十月也不得不承认：“在整个非洲南部，现在暴力行动已经是流行的手段。”
    全世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”帝国主义和殖民主义势力目前在非洲南部的疯狂挣扎，只不过是灭亡之前的一些捣乱。觉醒了的非洲南部人民只要走毛主席指引的道路，坚持长期斗争，必将击破以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的一切捣乱，使它们在革命人民的熊熊革命斗争烈火中彻底灭亡。
