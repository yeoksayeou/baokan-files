The 8341 Unit of the People's Liberation Army's three principles for supporting the left are as follows:

1. Vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought, and conduct in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work.

2. Do not hastily express opinions; conduct investigations and research. If both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, gradually unite them.

3. Learn from the workers, do not be afraid of making mistakes, and correct them if they are made. Care for the people's livelihood.
