Chen Tingyong, now thirteen years old, lives with his mother and younger brother near the vast American military airbase at Da Nang. The enemy killed his father.

The mother and her two sons have an unyielding blood debt with the American bandits. For a long time, they have stood firm on their native land, working and fighting side by side. Like thousands of their fellow villagers, they have witnessed the brutal acts of the American invaders, and their hearts burn with hatred. Day and night, they harbor a deep wish: to avenge their country and family, and to contribute their utmost to the annihilation of the American devils.

Besides helping his mother with household chores, little Yong dedicates all his spare time to "reconnaissance," investigating enemy movements.

Yong told his mother, "I haven't killed any American devils yet, but I have a way to support the uncle and auntie guerrillas in eliminating the enemy."

From day to night, from streets to shops, from playgrounds to enemy bases, wherever there are enemies, there are traces of Yong.

Every bit of valuable intelligence, through the tireless efforts of his mother and younger brother, quickly reaches the hands of the guerrilla units or the command of the liberation armed forces.

One day, Yong said to his mother, "The enemy's guns are quite good! I want to get a few and give them to the uncle and auntie guerrillas."

This is no easy task, like entering a tiger's den to catch a tiger cub! Yong did not hesitate, and over the course of a few months at the end of 1965, Yong alone seized five guns from the American devils, including three light machine guns, eight thousand rounds of ammunition, two hundred and eighty-two hand grenades, twelve radios, and other hundreds of items, all of which were handed over to the uncle and auntie guerrillas.

The weapons and ammunition provided by Yong played an active role in the encirclement battles near the enemy base. In a few months at the end of 1965, the guerrilla units in this region annihilated thousands of American invaders.

Yong is not only a living "arsenal" for the guerrillas and a well-informed eye, but he also often leads the guerrillas, effectively striking at the enemy.

This thirteen-year-old "Vietnamese boy" is very good at leading the American devils into the guerrillas' traps. Once, Yong even led the guerrillas to sneak near the Da Nang base airfield, destroying two jeeps and killing six devils on the vehicles.

Now, Yong has become the "Hero of Anti-American Warfare" in Quang Nam Province. In early 1966, at the "Hero of Anti-American Warfare" conference in the central region, he was the first to speak. His report moved the entire venue, and the representatives stood up multiple times, enthusiastically applauding and cheering for the revolutionary spirit and brave deeds of this young hero! Everyone listened tensely as Yong recounted his first infiltration into the enemy base to seize his first gun, which took three attempts before he succeeded.

    血海深仇激励杀敌决心　机智勇敢谱下英勇战歌
    南越小英雄立大功
    陈廷勇，今年十三岁，他和母亲、小弟弟一起居住在美国侵略军庞大的岘港空军基地附近。敌人杀害了他的父亲。
    母子三人和美国强盗有着不共戴天的血海深仇。长久以来，他们坚守在自己的乡土上，一边生产，一边战斗。和千百个乡亲们一样，他们是美国侵略者残暴行径的见证人，仇恨的怒火在他们心里沸腾、燃烧。他们日夜埋藏着一个心愿：要报国仇雪家恨，誓为消灭美国鬼子贡献自己最大的力量。
    小勇除了帮助母亲做一些家务之外，一有时间就全神贯注地进行“侦察”工作，调查敌人的情况。
    小勇对母亲说：“我还没有消灭美国鬼子，不过我有办法支援游击队叔叔和阿姨们消灭敌人。”
    从白天到黑夜，从街道到商店，从操场直到敌人的基地，那里有敌人，那里就有小勇的踪迹。
    敌人的一举一动都映入小勇机灵的眼睛里。每一宝贵的情报，通过他母亲和弟弟不辞劳苦的努力，很快就到了游击队或解放武装力量指挥部手里。
    一天，小勇对母亲说：“敌人的枪很不错！我要弄几支送给游击队的叔叔阿姨们。”
    这可是入虎穴擒虎子，不是那么容易的事啊！小勇并不犹豫，历经无数艰险，仅一九六五年末的几个月里，小勇一个人，就从美国鬼子手里夺得五支枪，其中有三挺轻机枪，八千发子弹，二百八十二颗手榴弹，十二部无线电机和其他成百件器材，全部送给了游击队的叔叔阿姨们。
    小勇提供的武器弹药，对敌人基地附近的围歼战斗起到了积极的作用。这个地区的游击队在一九六五年末的几个月里就消灭了成千名美国侵略者。
    小勇不仅是游击队的一个活“兵工厂”和游击队灵通的耳目，还经常给游击队带路，有效地打击敌人。
    这位十三岁的“越南小朋友”，很善于带着美国鬼子进到游击队的圈套里来。有一次，小勇还带着游击队潜至岘港基地空军机场附近，破坏了两辆吉普车，消灭了车上的六个鬼子。
    现在，小勇已经成为广南省的“歼美勇士”。一九六六年初，在中部地区的“歼美勇士”大会上，他第一个发言。他的报告激动了整个会场，代表们多次起立，为这位小英雄的革命精神和勇敢事迹热烈鼓掌欢呼！大家紧张地倾听着小勇第一次摸入敌人基地去夺取第一支枪的情景，经过三次反复，小勇才有机会下手，获得了成功。
