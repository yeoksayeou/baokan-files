The issue of learning style is a question of the thought method for leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members. It is a question of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. It is a question of the work attitude of all comrades in the Party. Since this is the case, the issue of learning style is a very important issue, it is the first important issue.

The 6979 Unit's Mao Zedong Thought Study Class Promotes Revolutionary Learning Style
Cadres and Soldiers Teach and Learn from Each Other, Making Joint Progress

From our correspondent: The 6979 Unit of the People's Liberation Army, with the slogan "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism, Struggle Against Self," has organized a study class for cadres and soldiers to learn Mao Zedong Thought together. Cadres and soldiers teach and learn from each other, establishing a revolutionary learning style and further strengthening the relationship between superiors and subordinates.

In mid-October, when the study class began, many cadres thought that the soldiers' level was low and that they needed to guide them well. The soldiers, on the other hand, were afraid that they knew too little theory and couldn't keep up. Thus, although they sat together, their hearts were not united. The leaders of the study class believed that cadres and soldiers studying together was not just a simple method; it was a revolution in cadre education, a revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao. They organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and teachings on the mass line, and also organized new soldiers to share their experiences of actively applying Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers' boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and their selfless spirit greatly educated the cadres. The cadres compared themselves with the soldiers, realizing that they were not superior to the soldiers in all aspects but were inferior in many ways. The cadres corrected their attitudes and sincerely learned from the soldiers, and the soldiers also dispelled their concerns.

Not long after the study class began, some cadres and soldiers became very close, and the "Red Pair" activities were lively and colorful; however, some cadres and soldiers were not as harmonious, and the "Red Pair" activities did not develop well. What was the reason? It turned out that some cadres had not completely put down their airs and often acted like teachers, not daring to reveal their personal flaws to the soldiers for fear of losing face. The study class then organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, inspiring the cadres to examine and criticize themselves, fiercely struggle against their selfishness, and immediately correct their behavior. Cadres and soldiers studied together, watered plants together, stood guard together, and entertained together. Some cadres helped soldiers stand guard, wash clothes, and bring meals to the sick, and their feelings became more harmonious. The cadres also proposed to learn from the soldiers in four ways: voluntarily approaching the soldiers, voluntarily accepting the soldiers' criticism, voluntarily accepting the soldiers' supervision, and voluntarily revealing their personal flaws to the soldiers. In this way, the cadres and soldiers' hearts were even closer. In study meetings, cadres and soldiers fully expressed their opinions, inspiring and helping each other. For example, during the big criticism, cadres, who had been in the army for a longer time, had a deeper understanding of the harm caused by Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan's bourgeois military line to the army, so they focused on criticizing this. Soldiers, who had left the countryside not long ago, had a deeper understanding of class struggle in the countryside, so they focused on criticizing China's Khrushchev's "three autonomies and one package" and the theory of the extinction of class struggle, and so on.

In the study class, cadres and soldiers together revealed and struggled against their personal flaws, supervising and correcting each other, truly achieving immediate results.

Cadres and soldiers also focused on the character of "loyalty" during their studies, that is, loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, grasping major principles, breaking major selfishness, and establishing great public spirit.

At the beginning, some cadres and soldiers helped and learned from each other, often focusing on minor issues and grasping minor principles. The study class then organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and politics, and Lin Biao's instructions on grasping major principles, making everyone realize that loyalty to Chairman Mao is the fundamental major principle of proletarian revolutionary soldiers. Cadres and soldiers, centering on this fundamental issue, together recalled the "three histories" (party history, military history, family liberation and personal growth history), discussed the "three new" (the great new situation of the Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao's new theory of revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the new stage of Marxism-Leninism developed to Mao Zedong Thought), praised Chairman Mao's brilliance, greatness, and correctness, and aroused deep class feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao; together fiercely criticized the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

Cadres also voluntarily asked soldiers to grasp their major principles, helping them break major selfishness and establish great public spirit. Deputy Political Instructor Ding Kangsheng of a certain regiment sometimes did not emphasize politics enough in his work in his unit. His "Red Pair," Platoon Leader He Zhouqiang, thought this was a major principle issue and helped him improve his understanding of this issue. He Zhouqiang used his personal experience to denounce Luo Ronghuan's emphasis on military first and opposition to emphasizing politics, which harmed him and his platoon, compared it with Lin Biao's proposal of the five principles of emphasizing politics, and the significant changes in the platoon's spirit after emphasizing politics, passionately sang the praises of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on political military building, and fiercely criticized Luo Ronghuan's heinous crimes, giving Ding Kangsheng a vivid lesson.

### 六九七九部队毛泽东思想学习班大树革命学风  干部战士互教互学共同进步

    学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。
    六九七九部队毛泽东思想学习班大树革命学风
    干部战士互教互学共同进步
    本报讯　中国人民解放军六九七九部队以“斗私，批修”为纲，举办干部、战士混合编组的毛泽东思想学习班，干部和战士互教互学，建立起革命的好学风，进一步密切了上下级关系。
    十月中旬，学习班开办之初，不少干部认为，战士水平低，自己要好好带着他们。战士则怕自己理论懂得少，跟不上队。这样，人坐到了一起，心没有联在一起。学习班的领导认为，干部、战士在一起学习，这不是一个简单的方法问题，这是干部教育上的一场革命，是毛主席提倡的革命学风。于是，就组织大家反复学习了毛主席的最新指示和关于群众路线的教导，又组织新战士讲自己在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作的体会。战士们对毛主席的无限忠诚，一心为公的思想境界，使干部受到很大教育。干部对比战士找差距，认识到自己不是什么都比战士强，而是许多地方不如战士。干部端正了态度，诚恳地向战士学习，战士也就消除了顾虑。
    学习班开办不久，有些干部和战士之间亲密无间，“一对红”活动有声有色；有的干部和战士却不太融洽，“一对红”活动开展不起来。这是什么原因呢？原来，有的干部没有完全放下架子，在行动上往往以先生的姿态出现，不敢在战士面前亮私，怕丢面子。于是，学习班就组织大家学习了毛主席的有关教导，启发干部对照检查自己，狠斗私心，并在行动上立即改正。干部和战士一起学习，一起浇水种菜，一起站岗放哨，一起娱乐，有的干部帮战士站岗、洗衣服、端病号饭等等，和战士在感情上更加融洽起来。干部还提出，向战士学习要做到四个自觉：自觉接近战士；自觉接受战士的批评；自觉接受战士的监督；自觉向战士亮私心。这样，干部、战士的心贴得更紧了。在学习会上，干部、战士都充分发表意见，互相启发，互相帮助。比如在进行大批判时，干部入伍时间较长，对彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事路线给部队造成的危害体会较深，就由干部重点批判；战士离开农村时间不长，对农村的阶级斗争体会较深，就由战士重点批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”，等等。
    在学习班里，干部和战士一起亮私心，斗私心，互相督促改正，真正做到学了就用，立竿见影。
    干部和战士在学习中还紧紧围绕一个“忠”字，即忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线，抓大节，破大私，立大公。
    开始，有的干部战士互帮互学，往往就事论事多，抓小节多，抓大节少。学习班就组织大家学习毛主席关于批评要注意政治的教导，和林副主席关于要注意抓大节的指示，使大家认识到，忠于毛主席是无产阶级革命战士高于一切的根本大节。干部、战士围绕着这个根本问题，一起忆“三史”（党史、建军史、家庭翻身和个人成长史），谈“三新”（文化大革命的大好新形势，毛主席在无产阶级专政条件下革命的新理论，马克思列宁主义发展到毛泽东思想的新阶段），颂扬毛主席英明、伟大、正确，激发对毛主席的无限热爱的深厚阶级感情；一起狠批党内最大的一小撮走资派。
    干部还自觉地要求战士抓自己大节上的问题，帮助自己破大私，立大公。某团副指导员丁康胜，在本连队工作中有时突出政治不够。他的“一对红”、本连班长何周祥认为这是大节问题，就帮助他提高对这个问题的认识。何周祥用亲身的经历，控诉罗瑞卿搞军事第一、反对突出政治对自己和班里的毒害，对比林副主席提出突出政治五项原则，大力突出政治以来全班精神面貌的显著变化，满怀激情地歌颂毛主席政治建军的光辉思想，满腔怒火地狠批罗瑞卿的滔天罪行，给丁康胜上了生动的一课。
