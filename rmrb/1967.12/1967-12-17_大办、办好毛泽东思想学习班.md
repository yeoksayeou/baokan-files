The Beijing Garrison Command held a meeting to exchange experiences on assisting revolutionary masses in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Everyone agreed that extensively conducting and conducting well Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a great strategic measure to educate cadres and the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, unify thinking, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

New China News Agency, December 15th: Amidst the high tide of conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes nationwide and the excellent situation of widely spreading Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison Command recently held a meeting to exchange experiences on assisting revolutionary masses in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Soldiers from the "three supports, two militaries" frontlines shared their experiences in assisting revolutionary masses in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes and unanimously agreed that the fundamental purpose of conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes is to firmly establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of great Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The focus of each session can be different, but the fundamental purpose remains the same. This must be the case for every session and every year. The soldiers expressed that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better assist revolutionary masses in conducting and conducting well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and let Mao Zedong Thought deeply take root in the minds of the broad masses, turning the capital into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the soldiers of the Beijing Garrison Command and the troops stationed in Beijing, who are responsible for the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries" in the capital, responded swiftly. In just over two months, they assisted factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools in conducting various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes totaling 14,800, with nearly a million people participating. This pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the capital to a new high, promoted the thought revolutionization of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, advanced revolutionary great alliances, revolutionary three-in-ones, revolutionary great criticisms, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of various units.

During the meeting, everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focusing on discussing and exchanging experiences on the great significance and methods of conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes. At the meeting, comrades executing "three supports, two militaries" tasks in the Beijing Hotel Office, Daxing County Yufu Commune, and Beijing No. 62 Middle School shared their experiences and insights on assisting revolutionary masses in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The meeting also invited revolutionary cadres, workers, teachers, and Red Guards who participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes to share their learning experiences.

At this meeting, the soldiers, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, combined their personal experiences to deeply discuss the guiding ideology of conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes at present. Their insights are as follows:

	(1) Everyone agreed that to assist revolutionary masses in conducting well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, one must first deeply understand the great significance of conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes and consciously regard conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes as the fundamental task. They pointed out that the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to arm the revolutionary people's minds, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, is a glorious task bestowed by the times and also the conscious demand of the broad revolutionary masses. Conducting and conducting well Mao Zedong Thought study classes is precisely a good method to turn the boundless Mao Zedong Thought into the soul of the broad revolutionary masses, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, one must not regard conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes as a temporary measure or expedient, but must elevate conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes to this height, assisting revolutionary masses in conducting them long-term, persistently, repeatedly, and forever. Both popularization and improvement must be emphasized. They stressed that the busier the work, the more important it is to emphasize politics, grasp the fundamentals, and conduct well Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Those who only focus on specific work and neglect grasping the fundamentals will lose direction. The soldiers deeply felt that in executing "three supports, two militaries" tasks, there are a thousand and ten thousand things to do, but conducting well Mao Zedong Thought study classes and assisting the masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the first priority; doing this and that without focusing on studying Chairman Mao's works is futile. Only by grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works can the masses have a soul, a commander, and a direction, making everything smooth and doing well in various tasks. No matter how busy, one must grasp this fundamental task.

	(2) Everyone, through personal experience, realized that conducting and conducting well Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a great strategic measure to educate cadres, educate the masses, unify thinking, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it must be grasped. They pointed out, based on their experiences, that the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is the deepest and broadest mass revolutionary movement, touching people's souls and transforming their worldviews. In this great revolution, proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology have been engaged in sharp and intense struggles. With what ideology to defeat various non-proletarian ideologies? With what ideology to unify the thoughts of the broad masses? Only by using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of the broad masses and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate the influence of the "self" left over from thousands of years of exploitative systems can we guide the broad revolutionary masses to advance victoriously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. Everyone said that through conducting study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of the broad masses is the key and inevitable path to the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. This is a strategic task of extremely profound significance. We must elevate conducting and conducting well Mao Zedong Thought study classes to this height, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and assist the broad revolutionary masses in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes better and better.

	(3) Everyone, from the experiences introduced at this meeting, more deeply realized that conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes must follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao: "Studying Chairman Mao's works must be done with problems in mind, actively studying and applying, combining study and use, learning first what is urgently needed, seeing immediate results, and focusing on the 'use' aspect." They said that the facts of many units show that those who conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes in this way achieve the greatest results and are most welcomed by the masses, and the unit's proletarian cultural revolution movement advances victoriously. Therefore, they pointed out that the leaders at various levels on the "three supports, two militaries" frontlines must purposefully, plannedly, and step-by-step unite the conducting of Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the current movement. What is the key issue in the current movement? What should the study class learn? The most prominent, concentrated, sharp, and complex problems in the mass movement are the central issues that the study class needs to solve the most. They said that assisting revolutionary masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "use" aspect, and using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything will be invincible.

Deputy Political Commissar Huang Zuozhen and Deputy Political Commissar Zhou Shuqing of the Beijing Garrison Command spoke at the meeting. They said that the great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The army should conduct study classes with soldiers participating." We must deeply understand and resolutely execute Chairman Mao's latest instructions, implementing them in assisting local areas in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They emphasized in their speeches that soldiers participating in "three supports, two militaries" must strictly demand of themselves and set a good example. Chairman Mao's instructions must be studied word by word and sentence by sentence and executed resolutely. They must further launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using what is learned immediately, learning a little and using a little, truly mastering the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, better completing the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries" given by Chairman Mao, and better assisting revolutionary masses in conducting and conducting well Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

　　大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班
    北京卫戍区召开帮助革命群众举办毛泽东思想学习班经验交流会。大家认为，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，是用毛泽东思想教育干部群众，统一思想，夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的伟大战略措施
    新华社十五日讯　在全国军民大办毛泽东思想学习班的高潮中，在毛泽东思想大普及的大好形势下，中国人民解放军北京卫戍区最近召开了帮助革命群众举办毛泽东思想学习班的经验交流会。来自“三支”“两军”第一线的指战员，畅谈帮助革命群众大办毛泽东思想学习班的收获，一致认为，举办毛泽东思想学习班的根本目的，就是要大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威。学习班每期的重点可以不同，它的根本目的只有这一个。期期如此，年年如此。指战员们表示：要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地协助革命群众大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，让毛泽东思想在广大群众的头脑中深深扎根，把首都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，在首都担负“三支”“两军”光荣任务的北京卫戍区和驻京部队广大指战员，闻风而动，在短短两个多月中，协助工厂、农村、机关、学校，以“斗私，批修”为纲，举办了各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班一万四千八百多个，近一百万人参加了学习，把首都活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新的高潮，促进了广大革命群众和革命干部的思想革命化，推动了革命的大联合，革命的三结合，革命的大批判和各单位的斗批改。
    会议期间，大家进一步反复地学习了毛主席的最新指示，着重讨论交流了大办毛泽东思想学习班的伟大意义和经验。会上，在北京市饭店工作办公室、大兴县榆垡公社、北京市第六十二中学等单位执行“三支”“两军”任务的同志，分别介绍了他们帮助革命群众办毛泽东思想学习班的体会和经验。会议还邀请参加毛泽东思想学习班学习的革命干部、工人、教员、红卫兵小将介绍了他们的学习心得。
    这次会议，指战员们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为指针，结合自己的亲身体会，集中深入地讨论了当前举办毛泽东思想学习班的指导思想问题，他们的体会是：
      （一）大家认为，要帮助革命群众办好毛泽东思想学习班，首先必须深刻领会大办毛泽东思想学习班的伟大意义，自觉地把大办毛泽东思想学习班作为根本任务来抓。他们指出，世界已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装革命人民的头脑，大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，是时代赋予我们的光荣任务，也是广大革命群众的自觉要求。而大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，又正是把光焰无际的毛泽东思想化为广大革命群众的灵魂，大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想绝对权威的好方法，因此，绝不能把举办毛泽东思想学习班当作什么权宜之计、临时措施来抓，必须把大办毛泽东思想学习班提到上述高度来认识，要帮助革命群众长期办下去，坚持办，反复办，永远办，既抓普及，又抓提高。他们强调指出：越是工作忙，就越要突出政治，狠抓根本，越要办好毛泽东思想学习班。那种单纯地急于抓具体工作，忘记了狠抓根本，就会迷失方向。指战员们深有体会地说，在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，工作有一千条，一万条，办好毛泽东思想学习班，帮助群众活学活用毛主席著作是第一条；这也抓，那也抓，不抓学习毛主席著作是瞎抓。只有抓好毛主席著作学习，群众有了灵魂，有了统帅，有了方向，才能一通百通，做好各项工作。千忙万忙，一定要抓住这个根本任务。
      （二）大家通过亲身体会认识到，大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班，是用毛泽东思想教育干部，教育群众，统一思想，夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的一项伟大战略措施，必须抓好。他们根据自己的体会指出，毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是最深刻最广泛的革命群众运动，是触及人们灵魂，改造人们世界观的大革命。在这场大革命中，无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想一直在进行着尖锐、激烈的斗争。用什么思想去战胜各种非无产阶级思想？用什么思想去统一广大群众的思想？只有用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来统一广大群众的思想，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来铲除几千年来剥削制度遗留下来的“私”字的影响，才能引导广大革命群众沿着毛主席指引的航道胜利前进。大家说，通过大办学习班，用毛泽东思想统一广大群众的思想，是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的关键和必由之路，这是一项具有极其深远意义的战略任务。我们必须把大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班提到这个高度来认识，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，帮助广大革命群众把毛泽东思想学习班办得好上加好。
      （三）大家从这次会上介绍的经验中，更深刻地认识到，举办毛泽东思想学习班，必须遵照林彪副主席的指示：“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”他们说，许多单位的事实说明，凡是这样办的毛泽东思想学习班，收效最大，群众最欢迎，这个单位的无产阶级文化大革命运动便胜利地向前发展。因此，他们指出，在“三支”“两军”第一线的各级领导一定要有目的、有计划、有步骤地把大办毛泽东思想学习班和当前的运动统一抓起来。当前运动的关键是什么，学习班就学什么，群众运动中最突出、最集中、最尖锐、最复杂的问题，就是学习班所最需要解决的中心问题。他们说，帮助革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，就无往而不胜。
    北京卫戍区第二政委黄作珍和副政委周树青在会上讲了话。他们说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“军队办学习班要有战士参加。”我们对毛主席的最新指示，一定要深刻领会，坚决执行，把毛主席的最新指示，落实到帮助地方大办毛泽东思想学习班的行动中去。他们在讲话中强调指出：参加“三支”“两军”的指战员必须处处严格要求自己，做好样子。对毛主席的指示，要字字句句认真学习，坚决照办。要进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，学了就要用，学一点用一点，把光焰无际的毛泽东思想真正学到手，更好地完成毛主席交给的“三支”“两军”的光荣任务，更好地帮助革命群众大办、办好毛泽东思想学习班。
