Tirana held a grand gathering to celebrate the glorious national day of the Albanian people.

Heroic Albania advances under the red banner of Marxism-Leninism.

The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and Comrade Mehmet Shehu attended the celebration. Kellezi pointed out that the revolutionary movement has achieved great victories, highly praising the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the great friendship between the peoples of Albania and China.

New China News Agency, Tirana, November 29th: The Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, the National Council of the Democratic Front, and the City Committee of the Party of Labour of Tirana held a grand gathering at the Cultural Palace of Tirana on the evening of the 28th to celebrate the 55th anniversary of Albania's independence (November 28th) and the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation (November 29th).

The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania, Comrade Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, and other party and government leaders attended the meeting.

	Workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, old guerrillas, families of martyrs, representatives of the people's army and various mass organizations attended the meeting. The Chinese government trade delegation led by Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Lin Haiyun and the Chinese Ministry of Communications port delegation led by Deputy Director of Shanghai Port Bureau Li Sheng were invited to attend the meeting.

	The meeting was presided over by Comrade Koçë Xhafa, Chairman of the State Planning Commission and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania.

	Comrade Kellezi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the People's Assembly of Tirana, addressed the meeting.

	Kellezi recounted the glorious history of the national liberation struggle of the Albanian people. He said, we took up arms and through armed revolution, through revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence, we finally won freedom.

	Kellezi then spoke about the great victories achieved by the Albanian people in the 23 years since liberation. He pointed out that during this period, the Albanian people overcame the enormous difficulties caused by the extremely backward conditions left over from the past and the conspiracies and brutal interventions of imperialism, Tito, and the Khrushchev revisionists. He said, our republic, our socialist homeland, was born in struggle and has grown stronger in struggle. It was born in a besieged environment, and today it is breaking through this siege because, as Comrade Enver Hoxha said, a nation fighting under the banner of Marxism-Leninism cannot be besieged. Neither the conspiracies of imperialism nor the conspiracies of revisionism, nor their alliances, can stop our advance.

	Kellezi said, we are striving to build a thorough socialist society. The historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party opened up new and even more magnificent prospects. Over the past year, the correctness of the Congress resolutions and the vitality of the historic documents of the Congress have been strongly demonstrated. The resolutions of the Congress, the Party's directives, Comrade Enver Hoxha's programmatic speeches, and the resolutions of the Central Committee Plenum are all based on Marxist-Leninist thought, giving a great impetus to the entire life of the country and inspiring the people to struggle for the construction of socialism.

	Kellezi said, 1967, the second year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, was a year of great victories in all aspects of life. The revolutionary creative enthusiasm of the Albanian people has had a very profound significance for the completion and over-fulfillment of this year's plan targets. This once again shows how powerful, profound, and correct the mass line implemented by our Party is. The Party's slogan of self-reliance has taken on an even broader significance.

	Kellezi pointed out that now Albania's industrial output is 39 times that of pre-war 1938. This year, agriculture has achieved even greater successes, with the average yield per unit area of wheat reaching the highest level in Albania's history. Cultural and educational undertakings have also achieved great successes.

	Kellezi said, in the face of these great achievements in our country, the Soviet revisionists and their followers claim that our plan has failed, which is laughable!

	Kellezi said, it is not us who have failed, but they who have failed; it is not us who are besieged, but they who are besieged; they are besieged by the revolutionary forces of the world; they have sold themselves to imperialism for 30 kopecks; this is the actual situation, these are the facts. Facts are ruthless. We are advancing towards socialism; while they are retreating towards the restoration of capitalism, becoming faithful servants of imperialism. We are holding high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism; while they have abandoned this banner, becoming the most vicious enemies of the peoples of all countries and the Soviet people—the partners of the American imperialists.

	Kellezi expounded on the great victories achieved in Albania's ideological and cultural revolution. He said, due to the deepening development of the ideological and cultural revolution led by the Party, 1967 was a year of great all-round progress. Our ideological and cultural revolution is striking a crushing blow to feudal-bourgeois old ideas, backward customs, practices that oppress women's personalities, ancient superstitions and religious doctrines that poison people's minds, and all old things that hinder progress, and is proposing new socialist standards of living and attitudes towards new progressive things.

	Kellezi then spoke about the international situation. He said, the international situation is excellent for the revolutionary forces of the whole world, for Marxism-Leninism, and for the peoples of various countries struggling for national liberation. The peoples of various countries have risen up in revolution.

	Kellezi exposed the conspiracies of imperialism led by the United States, colonialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionists. He said, all these conspiracies are doomed to suffer a humiliating failure. These conspirators of Soviet modern revisionism are doomed to perish. They will be swept away by the revolutionary tide of the Soviet people who will never forget the teachings of Lenin and Stalin and the experience of the October Revolution.

	Kellezi said, the day when the workers, peasants, intellectuals, soldiers, and youth of the Soviet Union rise up in revolution to overthrow the traitorous clique of Brezhnev-Kosygin, who have usurped the party and state power of the Soviet Union, is not far off.

	Kellezi severely condemned the speech of the great traitor Brezhnev at the so-called "celebration" of the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. He pointed out that Brezhnev distorted the facts, claiming that the October Revolution was achieved through a peaceful path. Kellezi said, this is a monstrous lie, further exposing the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists. The Bolshevik revolutionaries, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, seized power through armed struggle.

	Kellezi said, the Brezhnev revisionist clique is going to hold another revisionist party congress. They need such a congress to oppose the Communist Party of China, the Party of Labour of Albania, and all Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations. However, whether the revisionists hold a congress or not, one thing is clear: the dividing line has been drawn between, on the one hand, the Marxist-Leninists represented by the glorious Communist Party of China, the glorious Party of Labour of Albania, and other Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations, and, on the other hand, the Soviet and Tito modern revisionist traitors and all their followers. No matter whether the modern revisionists hold a congress or not, nothing can save them from their ultimate failure. The struggle has already begun, this is a life-and-death struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, the result of which will be the complete victory of Marxism-Leninism and the complete annihilation of revisionism, and imperialism and capitalism will also be destroyed. The fate of revisionism is closely linked to the fate of imperialism.

	Kellezi said, the Albanian people, the Party of Labour of Albania, and the People's Republic of Albania have won the admiration of the peoples of all countries who are fighting against imperialism, colonialism, revisionism, and striving for the victory of Marxism-Leninism in this heroic struggle. We are proud to have these friends.

	Kellezi said, the people of South and North Vietnam, who are bravely fighting against American imperialism and its lackeys, are our friends and comrades. Their heroic struggle against the brutal American imperialism and its lackeys is a great contribution to the peoples of all countries who are striving for freedom and independence.

	Kellezi highly praised the great friendship between the Albanian people and the Chinese people. He said, the Chinese people and the Albanian people are close friends. The friendship between our two peoples is a fighting revolutionary friendship forged in the invincible thought of Marxism-Leninism. Our friendship can withstand all storms.

	Kellezi said, the Communist Party of China, led by Chairman Mao Zedong, is successfully leading a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which, like a volcanic eruption, is sweeping away all revisionist and reactionary things. This revolution has turned the plans and conspiracies of the Chinese Khrushchev into ashes and dashed the hopes of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists. China is now and will forever be a red China, a revolutionary China, a Marxist-Leninist China, a socialist and communist China, a Mao Zedong China. The Albanian people and Albanian communists cheer the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and regard these victories as their own.

	Kellezi finally said, a great task lies before us. We are entering the third year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, a year of decisive significance for the completion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan. We must be better prepared than ever before, more vigorous than ever before, better armed with the vital thought of the Party than ever before, and more determined than ever before to work and struggle on all fronts of labor.

	Kellezi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause and shouts of "Party," "Enver Hoxha," etc. After the meeting, Comrade Hoxha and other party and government leaders of Albania watched with the attendees a song and dance performance reflecting the revolutionary movement of the Albanian people and the building of socialism with "one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun."

	In the following days, party and government leaders of Albania also went to various major cities in different districts to celebrate with local people the 55th anniversary of Albania's independence and the 23rd anniversary of its liberation.

    地拉那隆重集会热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民的光辉节日
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚高举马列主义红旗胜利前进
    阿人民伟大领袖霍查同志和列希谢胡同志等党政领导人出席凯莱齐强调指出革命化运动取得重大胜利，高度赞扬中国文化大革命和阿中人民的伟大友谊
    新华社地拉那二十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、民主阵线全国委员会和劳动党地拉那市委员会，二十八日晚在地拉那文化宫隆重举行集会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚独立五十五周年（十一月二十八日）和阿尔巴尼亚解放二十三周年（十一月二十九日）。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希同志，部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡同志和其他党政领导人出席了大会。
    参加大会的有工人、农业生产合作社社员、老游击队员、烈士家属，以及人民军部队和各群众团体的代表等。由对外贸易部代理部长林海云率领的中国政府贸易代表团和由上海港务局副局长李声率领的中国交通部港口代表团应邀出席了大会。
    大会由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、国家计划委员会主席科列加主持。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局候补委员、地拉那市人民会议执行委员会主席凯莱齐在大会上讲了话。
    凯莱齐叙述了阿尔巴尼亚人民所进行的民族解放斗争的光荣历史。他说，我们手握武器，通过武装革命，通过用革命的暴力来反对反革命的暴力，终于赢得了自由。
    凯莱齐接着谈到了解放二十三年来阿尔巴尼亚人民取得的巨大胜利。他指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民在这期间克服了由于过去遗留下来的极其落后的状况以及帝国主义、铁托和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者等的阴谋和粗暴干涉所造成的种种巨大困难。他说，我们的共和国，我们的社会主义祖国，是在斗争中诞生的，是在斗争中发展壮大的。它是在包围中诞生的，而它今天正在打破这个包围，因为正象恩维尔·霍查同志所说的，一个在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下战斗的民族，是包围不了的。无论是帝国主义的阴谋，还是修正主义的阴谋，还是它们的联盟，都不能阻止我们前进。
    凯莱齐说，我们正在为彻底建成社会主义社会而努力。劳动党的第五次代表大会的历史性决议，打开了新的更为宏伟的前景。一年来，代表大会决议的正确性，代表大会的历史性文件的生命力，得到了有力的表现。代表大会的决议、党的指示、恩维尔·霍查同志的纲领性的演说、中央全会的决议，都是建立在马克思列宁主义思想的基础上的，给了整个国家生活以巨大的推动力，唤起人民为建设社会主义而斗争。
    凯莱齐说，一九六七年，第四个五年计划的第二年，是在生活的各方面取得巨大胜利的一年。阿尔巴尼亚人民迸发出来的革命的创造积极性，对于完成和超额完成今年的计划指标，具有非常深刻的意义。这再次表明，我党实行的群众路线多么有力量、多么深刻和多么正确。党的自力更生口号，有了更加广泛的意义。
    凯莱齐指出，现在阿尔巴尼亚的工业产量比战前的一九三八年增长了三十九倍。今年农业取得了更大的成就，小麦的平均单位面积产量达到了阿尔巴尼亚迄今最高的水平。文化教育事业也取得巨大成就。
    凯莱齐说，在我国取得的这些伟大成就面前，苏联修正主义者及其追随者却宣传说我们的计划失败了，这是多么的可笑！
    凯莱齐说，失败的不是我们，而是他们；受到封锁的不是我们，而是他们，他们受到了世界革命力量的包围；以三十戈比的代价把自己卖给帝国主义的不是我们，而是他们。这就是实际情况，这些就是事实。事实是无情的。我们正在朝着社会主义前进；而他们正在朝着资本主义复辟倒退，变成了帝国主义的忠实奴才。我们正在高举马克思列宁主义的红旗；而他们抛弃了这面旗帜，变成了各国人民和苏联人民最凶恶的敌人——美帝国主义者的伙伴。
    凯莱齐阐述了阿尔巴尼亚思想文化革命取得的重大胜利。他说，由于党领导的思想文化革命的深入发展，一九六七年是取得伟大的全面进展的一年。我们的思想文化革命正在给封建—资产阶级旧观念、落后的风俗、压迫妇女个性的做法、毒害人们思想的古老的迷信和宗教信条，以及一切阻碍前进的旧的东西以粉碎性的打击，提出了新的社会主义的生活准则和对进步的新事物的态度的准则。
    凯莱齐接着谈到国际形势。他说，对全世界的革命力量、对马克思列宁主义、对为民族解放而斗争的各国人民来说，国际形势大好。各国人民已经起来革命。
    凯莱齐揭露了以美国为首的帝国主义、殖民主义、各国反动派和以苏修为首的现代修正主义者的阴谋。他说，所有这一切阴谋注定要遭到可耻的失败。苏联现代修正主义者这些阴谋家们是注定要灭亡的。他们必将被不能也不会忘记列宁和斯大林的教导、不能也不会忘记十月革命经验的苏联人民的革命浪潮一扫而光。
    凯莱齐说，苏联工人、农民、知识分子、军人和青年起来革命，推翻篡夺苏联党政大权的勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团的日子为期不远了。
    凯莱齐严厉地谴责了大叛徒勃列日涅夫在所谓“庆祝”十月社会主义革命五十周年会议上的讲话。他指出，勃列日涅夫歪曲事实，把十月革命说成似乎是通过和平道路进行的。凯莱齐说，这是弥天大谎，更加暴露了苏修的叛徒嘴脸。布尔什维克革命者在列宁和斯大林的领导下，是通过武装斗争夺取政权的。
    凯莱齐说，勃列日涅夫修正主义集团再一次要召开修正主义党代表会议。他们需要这样一个会议来反对中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党以及一切马克思列宁主义政党和组织。但是，不管修正主义者是否召开会议，有一点是清楚的：以光荣的中国共产党、光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党以及其他马克思列宁主义政党和组织为代表的马克思列宁主义者为一方，同以苏联和铁托现代修正主义叛徒以及他们的一切追随者为另一方之间的分界线，已经划定。不管现代修正主义者是否举行会议，任何东西都挽救不了他们最后的失败。斗争早就开始了，这是马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间的生死搏斗，其结果将是马克思列宁主义的彻底胜利，修正主义的彻底灭亡，帝国主义和资本主义将同样遭到毁灭。修正主义的命运同帝国主义的命运是密切相关的。
    凯莱齐说，阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在这场英勇的斗争中，博得了全世界正在反对帝国主义、殖民主义、修正主义、争取马克思列宁主义胜利的各国人民、各国和一切革命派的敬佩。我们为有这些朋友而感到自豪。
    凯莱齐说，正在对美帝国主义及其帮凶英勇作战的越南南方和北方的人民是我们的朋友和同志。他们为反对残暴的美帝国主义及其帮凶而进行的英勇斗争，对于正在致力于争取自由和独立的各国人民是一个巨大的贡献。
    凯莱齐高度赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民之间的伟大友谊。他说，中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民是亲密无间的朋友。我们两国人民之间的友谊，是用战无不胜的马克思列宁主义思想锻炼出来的战斗的革命的友谊。我们的友谊是经得起一切风暴的。
    凯莱齐说，以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党，正在成功地领导一场无产阶级文化大革命，这场革命象大火山爆发一样正在扫除一切修正主义和反动的东西。这场革命使中国的赫鲁晓夫的计划和阴谋化为灰烬，使美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者的希望化为泡影。中国现在和将来永远是红色的中国、革命的中国、马克思列宁主义的中国、社会主义和共产主义的中国、毛泽东的中国。阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚共产党人，欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，并把这些胜利看作是自己的胜利。
    凯莱齐最后说，伟大的任务摆在我们面前。我们正在进入第四个五年计划的第三年，这是对完成第四个五年计划具有决定意义的一年，我们要比以往任何时候都更有准备，比以往任何时候都更朝气蓬勃，比以往任何时候都更好地用党的有生命力的思想武装起来，比以往任何时候都更有决心在各条劳动战线上工作和奋斗。
    凯莱齐的讲话不时被热烈的掌声和“劳动党”、“恩维尔·霍查”等欢呼声所打断。大会结束后，霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚其他党政领导同志同与会群众一起，观看了反映阿尔巴尼亚人民革命化运动和“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”建设社会主义的歌舞。
    几天来，阿尔巴尼亚党政领导人还分别到各区主要城市同当地群众一起，欢庆阿尔巴尼亚独立五十五周年和解放二十三周年。
