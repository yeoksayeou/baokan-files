Malayan revolutionaries actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, striving to implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

The Malayan Communist Party, hoisting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is determined to drive out the British imperialists, overthrow the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime, and achieve genuine independence for a united Malaya.

A recent issue of the organ of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in China, "Malayan News," reported that the Marxist-Leninist Malayan Communist Party, hoisting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is leading the Malayan National Liberation Army and the Malayan National Liberation League in making every effort to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

The article said that as early as 1951, the Political Bureau of the Malayan Communist Party emphasized in a resolution the importance of party members studying Mao Zedong's works.

The article said that the guerrilla units of the Malayan National Liberation Army frequently listen to broadcasts of Chairman Mao's quotations from Beijing Radio. They enthusiastically study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the masses. Portraits of Chairman Mao and his quotations are hung in the camps of the liberation army.

The article said that the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime is desperately trying to prevent the sale, distribution, and circulation of Chairman Mao's works. They arrest and punish anyone found with materials containing Chairman Mao's quotations, regardless of age or gender.

However, the more the puppet regime imposes punishments and restrictions, the more daring the people become, overcoming greater difficulties and adopting more ingenious methods to spread the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, using the quintessence of Marxist-Leninist truth—"rebellion is justified"—to educate the people.

Revolutionary people, undeterred by the fascist laws of the puppet regime, continue to organize study classes nationwide to propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

The article said that portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao are sold in the thousands across the country. The Little Red Book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," is enthusiastically welcomed by the people of Malaya. In Singapore alone, about 8,000 copies are secretly sold each month.

Postage stamps printed with Chairman Mao's quotations have become a common method of spreading revolutionary truth. These stamps help raise the political consciousness of the people and educate them about the nature of imperialism and the puppet government.

Now, the people of Malaya are also printing Chairman Mao's quotations on various forms of currency. Despite the puppet regime's strictest restrictions, this currency continues to circulate.

The article said that a newspaper of a mass organization, defying the fascist laws of the puppet regime, has continuously published Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" this year: "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "On the Rectification of Work Style." It also wrote introductory articles and annotations for studying these three articles. The introductory article said that the famous "Three Articles" are essential reading for all those engaged in the proletarian revolution. The "Three Articles" are valuable guidelines for all revolutionaries.

To study Mao Zedong Thought, one must start with the "Three Articles" and use the "Three Articles" to transform people's worldviews. Without a correct starting point, a correct standpoint, and a correct worldview, one cannot grasp the laws of social development, nor can one truly master Chairman Mao's theories, policies, and methods and engage in revolutionary struggle.

The newspaper also quoted Comrade Lin Biao's words: "Study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, study and apply them actively, combine study with application, learn what is urgently needed first, and see immediate results. Focus on the 'use' aspect."

The article concluded that the revolutionary forces of Malaya are striving to study, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, aiming to drive out the British imperialists supported by the United States, overthrow the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime, and achieve genuine independence for a united Malaya.

　　马来亚革命者活学活用毛主席著作
    努力执行、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想
    马来亚共产党高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，决心赶走英帝，推翻拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团，取得统一的马来亚的真正独立
    新华社十一日讯　最近一期的马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团的机关刊物《马来亚公报》发表文章说，马克思列宁主义的马来亚共产党，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，她领导下的马来亚民族解放军和马来亚民族解放同盟，正在尽最大的努力活学活用毛泽东思想。
    文章说，早在一九五一年，马来亚共产党政治局在一项决议中就强调党员学习毛泽东著作的重要性。
    文章说，马来亚民族解放军的游击队经常收听北京电台广播的毛主席语录。他们热情地学习，并在群众中宣传毛泽东思想。解放军的营地里都挂有毛主席像和毛主席语录。
    文章说，拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团拚命阻止毛主席著作的出售、散发和发行。他们发现任何人带着印有毛主席语录的材料，不问年龄和性别，都要逮捕和惩罚。
    然而，傀儡集团的惩罚和限制越多，人民就变得更加果敢，克服更大的困难，采取更机灵的方法来传播光焰无际的毛泽东思想，用马克思列宁主义真理的最本质的东西——“造反有理”来教育人民。
    革命人民不顾傀儡集团的法西斯法规，继续组织起来，在全国搞学习班，宣传毛泽东思想。
    文章说，伟大领袖毛主席的照片在全国各地销售数以千计。《毛主席语录》这本红书在马来亚受到人民的热烈欢迎。仅新加坡一个城市每月就秘密售出大约八千册。
    印有毛主席语录的邮票，已经成为传播革命真理的一种普遍办法。这些邮票有助于提高人民的政治觉悟和教育他们认识帝国主义和傀儡政权的本质。
    现在，马来亚人民还把毛主席语录印在各种货币上面。尽管傀儡集团实行最严格的限制，这种货币一直在传来传去。
    文章说，有一个群众团体的报纸不顾傀儡集团的法西斯法律，今年连续刊载了毛主席的老三篇《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》，并为学习这三篇文章写了介绍文章和注解。介绍文章说，著名的“老三篇”是所有进行无产阶级革命的人的必读材料。“老三篇”是所有革命者的宝贵的行动准则。
    要学习毛泽东思想，必须从“老三篇”开始，并运用“老三篇”来改造人们的世界观。没有一个正确的出发点，正确的立场和正确的世界观，就不能掌握社会发展的规律，也不能真正地掌握毛主席的理论、政策和方法并进行革命斗争。
    这家报纸还引用了林彪同志的话：“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”
    文章最后说，马来亚的革命力量正在努力学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想，以便赶走美国所支持的英帝国主义者，推翻拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团，取得一个统一的马来亚的真正独立。
