The heroic deeds of Comrade Li Wenzhong and his fellow soldiers, who wrote a magnificent poem of supporting the left and loving the people with their lives, are a testament to their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, embodying the spirit of "publicness" and serving as a shining example of ideological revolutionization.

Our unit had previously worked alongside the 601st Unit, where the heroic Fourth Platoon is based, to carry out the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks. During my time supporting the left, I had an unforgettable meeting with Li Wenzhong, the model of supporting the left and loving the people. The noble thoughts of the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong left a deep and indelible impression on us.

It was in January of this year, during the nationwide Red Revolution, that I was assigned to work in the support office of a certain unit in Jiangxi. One day, while conducting a social survey at a certain middle school, I happened to encounter Comrade Li Wenzhong, who was responsible for military training at the school. That noon, in a classroom adorned with Chairman Mao's quotations, Li Wenzhong, dressed in a faded yellow military uniform and patched shoes, greeted me with a warm smile. We discussed the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the area. When I earnestly asked him to share his experiences in supporting the left, he was very modest, smilingly saying, "We have no successful experiences; we just follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Where Chairman Mao loves, I love; where Chairman Mao supports, I support; where Chairman Mao directs, I act; where Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance."

Hearing these powerful words, I was deeply moved. What noble language, what precious experience! After chatting for a while, Li Wenzhong, who had to attend a meeting, took out a summary of their work in promoting revolutionary unity at the school and handed it to me, saying, "Please give us some feedback on this work summary." Then, he enthusiastically escorted me to the school gate, and we shook hands and parted ways. The summary material that Li Wenzhong gave me is still preserved by me, serving as a precious memento for me to learn from him forever.

Soon, Li Wenzhong was assigned a new task and left the school. However, his deeds of loving Chairman Mao's Red Guards were widely praised among the students. Whenever I met with the revolutionary young Red Guards who had interacted with Li Wenzhong, they would always share with me many moving stories about him. The revolutionary young Red Guards in the class that Li Wenzhong was responsible for had shown me the quotation board that Li Wenzhong made for their class. After entering the school, Li Wenzhong saw that the students' desks were empty, so he initially made quotation boards out of hard paper for each student to transform the classroom into a battlefield for propagating and studying Mao Zedong Thought. A few days later, he found that the paper quotation boards were easily worn out and gradually lost their bright red color. He thought, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths, each word is worth a thousand gold pieces, and they must always be kept in bright red color." Therefore, he decided to replace the quotation boards on the desks with glass-framed ones. To save resources for the revolution, he used waste glass to make the frames. On weekends, he bought some waste glass from the city and spent several evenings carefully making dozens of quotation boards, fixing them on each desk. Now, whenever the students sit at their desks and recite Chairman Mao's quotations in unison, they think of Li Wenzhong's deep class feelings for Chairman Mao.

Comrade Li Wenzhong also helped the revolutionary young Red Guards raise their class consciousness, never forgetting class bitterness, and firmly remembering blood debts to better follow Chairman Mao in the revolution. Once, he led the Red Guard young revolutionaries on a field trip. When they passed by the revolutionary martyrs' cemetery with their backpacks, he led them to the martyrs' graves, sharing his own bitter family history and linking it with the lives of revolutionary martyrs, giving the young revolutionaries a vivid revolutionary education class.

In the class where Li Wenzhong was responsible for military training, there is a half-body statue of Chairman Mao that he gave to the entire class, which was his most precious gift to the students before he left. Now, every day, the students face this statue of Chairman Mao, sing "The East is Red," and wish Chairman Mao eternal life!

Comrade Li Wenzhong's moving deeds are many. He loves Chairman Mao with all his heart, he defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with his life, and he clearly supports the proletarian revolutionary faction. He will always live in our hearts, and he will always be my role model.

    同李文忠同志一次难忘的会见
    解放军某部　王心田
    英雄排长李文忠等三位同志用生命谱写的支左爱民的壮丽诗篇，是无限忠于毛主席革命路线的“公”字篇，是思想革命化的光辉榜样。
    我们部队曾经同英雄四排所在的六○一一部队一起，并肩执行过“三支”“两军”任务。我在支左中曾经和支左爱民模范李文忠同志有一次难忘的会见。在这次会见中，四排和李文忠同志的崇高思想，给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。
    那是在今年一月红色革命风暴席卷全国的时候，我被分配到江西某地部队支左办公室工作。有一次，我去某中学做社会调查，恰好遇见了正在这个学校担任军训任务的排长李文忠同志。那天中午，在一间挂满毛主席语录的教室里，李文忠同志身穿一件褪色的黄军衣，脚穿一双带补钉的鞋，满脸笑容地和我交谈当地无产阶级文化大革命的情况。当我恳切地请他介绍支左经验的时候，他非常谦虚，笑着对我说：“我们没有什么成功的经验，只是跟着毛主席的革命路线走。毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
    听了这刚劲有力的四句话，我深受感动。这是多么崇高的语言，多么宝贵的经验啊！谈了一会儿，李文忠同志因为要去开会，他从身上掏出一份他们在这个中学“促进实现革命大联合”的经验总结，塞到我的手里说：“这份工作总结，请你给我们提点意见。”接着，他就热情地把我送到学校门口，我们就握手告别了。李文忠同志送给我的这份总结材料，现在我还保存着，它成为我永远学习李文忠同志的珍贵纪念品。
    不久，李文忠同志奉命执行新的任务，离开了这个学校。但是，他对毛主席的红卫兵无限热爱的事迹却在同学中到处传诵着。每当我遇到和李文忠同志相处过的红卫兵革命小将时，他们总是对我谈起李文忠的许多动人事迹。李文忠负责军训的这个班的革命小将，曾领我看过李文忠给他们班做的毛主席语录板。李文忠进校以后，看到同学们的书桌上空空的，为了把教室变成宣传和学习毛泽东思想的阵地，他最初用硬纸板为每个同学制做了一块语录板。几天以后，他发现纸做的语录板容易磨损，逐渐失去鲜红的颜色。他想，毛主席的话句句是真理，字字值千金，一定要时刻保持鲜红的颜色。于是，他决心把书桌上的毛主席语录板，改装成玻璃镜框。为了节约闹革命，他就利用废玻璃制作镜框。星期天，他从城里买了些废玻璃回来，利用几个晚上，精心地制成了几十块毛主席语录板，固定在每个书桌上。现在，每当同学们坐到书桌前，齐声朗读毛主席语录时，就想起李文忠对毛主席无限深厚的阶级感情。
    李文忠同志还处处帮助革命小将提高阶级觉悟，不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，更好地紧跟毛主席干革命。有一次，他带领红卫兵小将野营回来，大家背着背包徒步路过革命烈士陵园，他就把大家带到烈士墓前，讲自己的苦难家史，联系革命烈士的生平，给革命小将上了一堂生动的革命教育课。
    在李文忠同志负责军训的这个班里，有他送给全班同学的毛主席半身塑像，那是他临走时给同学们留下的最珍贵的礼物。现在，每天同学们都面对着这尊毛主席像，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    李文忠同志的动人事迹是很多的。他赤胆忠心地热爱毛主席，他舍死忘生地捍卫毛主席的革命路线，他旗帜鲜明地支持无产阶级革命派。他永远活在我们的心里，他永远是我学习的榜样。
