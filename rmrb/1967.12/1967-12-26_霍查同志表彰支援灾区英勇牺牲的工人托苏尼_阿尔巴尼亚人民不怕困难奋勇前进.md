The Albanian people are undaunted by difficulties and forge ahead bravely

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 23rd, the great leader of the Albanian people, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, Comrade Enver Hoxha, wrote a letter on the 21st to the mother and wife of Tosuni Xhahina, a construction worker who sacrificed himself in supporting the people of Librazhd District in overcoming the earthquake disaster. The letter praised the lofty patriotism and revolutionary heroism of Tosuni and his family.

	In the letter, Comrade Hoxha pointed out that Tosuni's lofty example will further inspire the patriotic peasants, heroic working class, brave Albanian army, women, and youth of Albania to be even more filled with revolutionary enthusiasm for the great cause of the Party and the people.

	The letter praised the patriotism of Tosuni's family in turning their grief into strength after learning of Tosuni's sacrifice.

	The letter said that the Albanian people are working and struggling to build socialism. Under the reliable leadership of the Party, they are achieving one victory after another. No difficulties can stop the Albanian people from advancing.

	Tosuni was a worker at the Malik Agricultural Cooperative in Korça District. After the strong earthquake in Librazhd District on November 30, he immediately responded to the Party's call and, together with 81 construction workers from Korça District, volunteered to go to Librazhd District to support the disaster-stricken people in building houses. He worked hard and diligently, but unfortunately, he sacrificed himself in an accident while moving stones.
