Albania's Exports Further Increase
The Export Plan for the First Eleven Months of This Year Exceeded by 3%

New China News Agency reports: According to a report from the Albanian News Agency, Albania's export volume this year has further increased compared to last year. The export plan for the first eleven months of this year has been exceeded by 3%.

Due to continuous improvements in product quality and an increase in variety, Albanian products are well-received in foreign markets.

Albania has changed its past practice of only exporting raw materials and semi-finished products. Currently, more than half of Albania's export commodities are industrial products and semi-finished industrial products, which is a result of Albania's socialist industrialization. Albania's exports, including copper wire, various types of paper, forestry by-products, plywood, thin plates, flooring strips, textiles, knitted goods, and foodstuffs, all enjoy a good reputation in foreign markets.

Albania has already signed trade agreements for 1968 with China as well as many other countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa.

    阿对外贸易出口额进一步增长
    今年头十一个月的出口计划超额完成
    新华社讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚今年的对外贸易出口额比去年有了进一步的增长，今年头十一个月的出口计划超额完成了百分之三。
    由于产品质量的不断提高和品种的增多，阿尔巴尼亚的产品在国外市场受到欢迎。
    阿尔巴尼亚现在已经改变过去那种只出口原料和原料半制品的状况。目前，阿尔巴尼亚的出口商品中有一半以上是工业品和工业半制品，这是阿尔巴尼亚社会主义工业化的结果。阿尔巴尼亚出口的铜丝、各种纸张、林木副产品、胶合板、薄板、地板木条、纺织品、针织品和食品等在国外市场上都享有声誉。
    阿尔巴尼亚已经同中国以及欧洲、亚洲和非洲的其他许多国家签订了一九六八年的贸易协定。
