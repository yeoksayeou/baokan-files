When the delegation members and invited guests, including Nguyen Van Khoa, Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, and Le Chung Thi, Counselor of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, arrived at the theater with Chen Yi and others, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time, paying tribute to the messengers from the front lines of the anti-American struggle in South Vietnam.
