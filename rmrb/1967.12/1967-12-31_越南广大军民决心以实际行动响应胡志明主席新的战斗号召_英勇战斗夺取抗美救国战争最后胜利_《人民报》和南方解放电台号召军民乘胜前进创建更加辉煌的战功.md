According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 30th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the great leader of the Vietnamese people, recently delivered an important speech at a gathering commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army and the 21st anniversary of the national resistance war. This speech has greatly inspired the broad masses of the military and people in North Vietnam. They have expressed their determination to resolutely respond to Chairman Ho's new battle call, press forward with victory, and bravely fight to make the greatest contributions to achieving the final victory in the anti-American national salvation struggle.

Soldiers from the Fourth Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battery, who have distinguished themselves in the defense of the capital Hanoi, have written letters of determination to Chairman Ho after hearing his call. They have expressed their resolve to strengthen training, continuously improve combat effectiveness, and shoot down more enemy aircraft with the fewest shells possible.

Nguyen Van Yang, a driver from the 28th Transportation Team, who frequently travels on the transportation lines in North Vietnam, said: "We must remember Chairman Ho's teachings, overcome all difficulties and hardships, quickly and safely transport supplies, and better serve the battle, production, and people's lives. The crazy attacks by the American aggressors will not stop our victorious advance."

Liu Chun Bich, the leader of the 44th Loading Team at Haiphong, the largest port in North Vietnam, said: "Chairman Ho's words have strengthened our resolve to defeat the American aggressors. All the port workers are determined to respond to the call of our beloved Chairman Ho, ready to rush to the front lines at any time, strive to overcome all difficulties, and fight to complete all tasks well."

The entire company of the Sixth Company of the Capital Garrison Anti-Aircraft Artillery Unit, which has been awarded the title of "Victorious," unanimously passed a resolution at a meeting addressed to Chairman Ho and the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party. In the resolution, they expressed their determination to deepen their hatred for the enemy, fear neither hardship nor sacrifice, and resolutely strike down invading enemy aircraft more fiercely and accurately, creating new achievements in the anti-American national salvation war.

Workers at the Hanoi Electric Machinery Factory, who completed this year's national plan 50 days ahead of schedule, have launched a competition to respond to Chairman Ho's new battle call. The workers in the assembly workshop are also assembling various electric motors with every second counting, striving to produce more new products to support their fellow units.

Members of the Mu Lau Agricultural Cooperative, who were awarded the Advanced Red Banner on the agricultural production front in 1967, have also expressed their determination to achieve even greater harvests this winter and next spring to support the front lines, responding to Chairman Ho's battle call with concrete actions.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 27th, the *People's Daily* published an editorial on the 27th, calling on all officers and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army to respond to Chairman Ho's new great battle call, bravely advance, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

The editorial said: "Every word of Chairman Ho is a great inspiration to our army. Every teaching of Chairman Ho adds to the fighting strength of our army's officers and soldiers. Every call of Chairman Ho is a battle cry for our army to charge forward and seize victory."

The editorial said, our entire army is responding to Chairman Ho's sacred call, bravely advancing, and creating new achievements. With deep hatred for the American aggressors and boundless love for the independence and freedom of our motherland, we are determined to implement Chairman Ho's teachings, continuously strengthen our combat effectiveness, fight fiercely and well, win bigger battles, and dedicate everything to the cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and reunifying the country.

The commentary concluded by expressing that the entire military and people of South Vietnam, together with the 17 million compatriots in the North, will definitely resolutely implement Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call. All soldiers and people will become brave warriors in annihilating the Americans, and every village will become a strong fortress in annihilating the Americans. They will strike the enemy fiercely and accurately, achieving even more glorious victories in the anti-American national salvation struggle.
