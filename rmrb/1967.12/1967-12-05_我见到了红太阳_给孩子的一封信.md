I saw the red sun—
	A Letter to My Children
	Representative of the First National Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao’s Works in the Navy, Family Member of a Certain Unit, Dǒng Xiùyīng

Children,

Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. The greatest blessing comes from Chairman Mao! Mother has been longing for this day, month after month, and today I finally saw the reddest sun in my heart. Chairman Mao is in the best of health, with a radiant face. This is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the world. Quickly tell this great news to the whole family, to our neighbors and friends, to the teachers and children at school, so they can all be happy too.

Mother is now the happiest person in the world! When Chairman Mao, with a smile on his face, walked towards us waving his hand, mother’s heart was so excited that it almost jumped out of her chest, and tears immediately flowed down.

Children, these are the happiest tears! I shouted with all my might: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao probably heard my shout, and he kept waving and smiling at me. I shouted until my throat was hoarse, but I still felt that I hadn’t shouted out all the boundless love and respect I have for Chairman Mao in my heart.

Children, you should also shout with all your might with mother: Long live Chairman Mao! Let us shout this together, generation after generation!

In the old society full of evil, the “three big mountains” weighed heavily on us poor people. My family has been working for the landlords for three generations. Your grandfather worked himself to the bone all year round, but still couldn’t feed the whole family. Your grandmother, due to excessive labor and hunger, left this world when I was three years old. My birthday was washed away by the hard times, and to this day, I still don’t know my own birthday. In fact, in the old society, a poor person’s birthday is the beginning of hardship, what’s the use of remembering it!

Today, mother has seen the red sun. If it weren’t for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party leading us poor people to rebel, if it weren’t for the countless martyrs who shed their blood and sacrificed their lives to overthrow the “three big mountains” that weighed on the poor people, seize power, and establish New China, mother would have turned to ashes long ago! Chairman Mao is the closest and dearest person to me, the greatest savior of the poor people.

Chairman Mao not only saved my body, but he also gave me a revolutionary soul, making me understand that one should be a revolutionary, completely and thoroughly serve the people, and strive for the seizure and consolidation of power for the proletariat all one’s life, only then can one live a meaningful life.

Children, you must always remember: today mother saw the great leader, the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao! To forever remember Chairman Mao’s blessings, mother will set this happiest day as her own birthday. You must remember this day in your hearts and pass it down from generation to generation.

Children, you must read Chairman Mao’s books, listen to Chairman Mao’s words, and act according to Chairman Mao’s instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao; in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you must better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, be the vanguard of fighting the self, the pioneers of criticizing revisionism, take over the revolution, follow the helmsman Chairman Mao, and never turn back in the face of storms and waves.

Let us together wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

	Mother
	December 3, Beijing

    我见到了红太阳
    ——给孩子的一封信
    海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表、某部家属　董秀英孩子：
    爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，天大地大哪有毛主席的恩情大！妈妈天天盼，月月盼，今天终于见到了心中最红最红的红太阳。毛主席他老人家红光满面，身体非常非常健康，这是全国人民和全世界人民的最大幸福。你快把这个特大喜讯告诉全家，告诉街坊亲友，告诉学校里的老师和小朋友，也让他们高兴高兴。
    妈妈现在是世界上最幸福的人啦！当毛主席他老人家微笑着挥手向我们走来的时候，妈妈的心激动得几乎要跳出来，眼泪一下子就流下来。
    孩子，这可是最幸福、最幸福的泪水啊！俺使出了全身的力气喊：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！毛主席他老人家大概是听到了俺的喊声，不断地向俺招手、微笑。俺把喉咙都喊哑了，但是总觉得还没有把满心眼对毛主席无限敬爱的感情喊出来。
    孩子，你们也放开喉咙和妈妈一齐高喊毛主席万岁吧！让俺们家世世代代都喊下去吧！
    在万恶的旧社会，“三座大山”压得俺穷人好苦啊！俺家祖辈三代都给地主扛活，你外祖父累死累活一年干到头，还是养不活全家老小。你外婆因过分劳累和饥饿，在俺三岁的时候就离开了人间。俺的生日，也就被苦难的日子冲掉了，一直到现在，俺还不知道自己的生日。其实在旧社会，穷人的生日正是苦难的开始，记着它有什么用！
    今天，妈妈可见到了红太阳。不是毛主席、共产党领导俺们穷人闹翻身，不是成千成万的先烈流血牺牲，推翻了压在穷人头上的“三座大山”，夺取了政权，建立起新中国，妈妈早就成灰啦！毛主席就是俺最亲最亲的亲人，是俺穷人最大最大的救星。
    毛主席不但救了俺的身，他老人家还给了俺一个革命的灵魂，使俺懂得了做人要做革命人，要完全彻底为人民服务，为无产阶级夺取政权和巩固政权而奋斗终生，这样才活得有意义。
    孩子，你们要永远永远地记住：今天妈妈见到了伟大的领袖、俺们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席！为了永远记住毛主席的恩情，妈妈就把这最最幸福的日子定为自己的生日。你们要把这一天永远记在心里头，世世代代传下去。
    孩子，你们一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士；在文化大革命中，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，做斗私的尖兵，当批修的闯将，接好革命的班，跟着舵手毛主席，大风大浪不回头。
    让我们一起祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                    妈　妈
            十二月三日于北京
