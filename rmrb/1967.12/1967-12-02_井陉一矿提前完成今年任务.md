The revolutionary workers of Jinxing No. 1 Mine of the Jinxing Mining Bureau in Hebei Province, with the line of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," have been vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously promoting production. Coal production has been increasing month by month. By November 28, they had completed this year's annual national coal production task 32 days ahead of schedule.

The revolutionary workers of Jinxing No. 1 Mine have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They study Chairman Mao's works above ground, use the "Three Articles" as a mirror to fight against selfishness, and establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people. They criticize revisionism below ground, eliminate the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, work closely together, grasp production, produce more coal, produce good coal, support the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the country, and are determined to achieve double victories in revolution and production. Since entering November, the coal output of the entire mine has surged. The average daily output from the 1st to the 28th of the month has increased by more than 17 percent compared to October.
