The Central Political Bureau of the Burmese Communist Party has resolved that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China further advances the world revolutionary process. Comrade Mao Zedong is the leader of the world proletariat. The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the international communist movement.

Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of Marxism-Leninism in our era. Comrade Mao Zedong has pointed out the path for the proletariat of all countries to achieve victory and for oppressed nations to gain complete liberation from colonialism. He has proposed a comprehensive set of theories and policies to prevent revisionist elements from seizing the leadership of the party and the state in socialist countries, to prevent the restoration of capitalism, and to carry the socialist revolution to completion. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all revolutionary work in Burma. The Burmese Communist Party has decided to launch a mass movement to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The Burmese people must raise high the banner of "winning the war and seizing power" to overthrow the Ne Win military dictatorship and strive for the victory of the revolutionary war led by the Burmese Communist Party.

	New China News Agency, December 10th: Yangon News: The resolution of the Central Political Bureau of the Burmese Communist Party on the great proletarian cultural revolution in China states: "The great proletarian cultural revolution in China further advances the process of the world proletarian revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong is the leader of the world proletariat, and the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the international communist movement."

	The resolution states: "Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism and communism are heading towards global victory. It must be clearly recognized that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of Marxism-Leninism in our era. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all revolutionary work in Burma."

	This resolution of the Central Political Bureau of the Burmese Communist Party was published in the Burmese Communist Party's theoretical journal "People's Power" in Volume 2, Issue 2, 1967.

	The resolution first expounds on the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. It states: "The great proletarian cultural revolution in China is the most significant event of the 1960s. It has developed China's socialist revolution to a deeper and broader new stage, writing a new chapter in the history of the world proletarian revolution. The great proletarian cultural revolution in China is an unprecedented great revolution. It is for the consolidation and strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, and it is also for the further development of the world proletarian revolution."

	The resolution states that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the core of Marxism-Leninism and the fundamental issue of the proletarian revolution. In countries where the people have not yet seized power, the proletariat and revolutionary people must, according to the Marxist-Leninist theory of violent revolution, smash the bourgeois state machine and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat through armed struggle. In countries where the dictatorship of the proletariat has already been established, it is necessary to insist on the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry the socialist revolution to completion, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	The resolution states: "Comrade Mao Zedong has summed up the entire history of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the world, especially the bitter lessons of the betrayal of the revolution by the Khrushchev group and the restoration of capitalism in Lenin's homeland— the Soviet Union. He has developed the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat to a new height, creating a complete set of theories to prevent revisionism and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, led personally by Comrade Mao Zedong, has set a new example for the world proletariat in solving the historical problem of how to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism.

	The resolution states that during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road were exposed within the Communist Party of China. This is a law of class struggle. "Exposing and overthrowing the representatives of the bourgeoisie in the leadership organs clearly shows the greatness and strength of the Communist Party of China."

	The resolution states: "During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, we Burmese proletarian revolutionaries must also actively participate and stand together with the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries. We must absolutely not be neutral. Because the enemies of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China are also our enemies."

	The resolution solemnly declares: "Raising high the banner of 'winning the war and seizing power,' the Burmese proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people who are fighting against the Ne Win military dictatorship resolutely support Comrade Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. They resolutely support the revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary students in China, who, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, are fighting to seize power from the power-holders taking the capitalist road."

	The resolution states that the most distinctive feature of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is that it has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, scientifically expounded the position of Mao Zedong Thought in the development history of Marxism-Leninism, and the profound significance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The resolution highly evaluates the great contribution of Mao Zedong Thought to the development of Marxism-Leninism. It states that Mao Zedong Thought has developed in the struggle against modern revisionism. "Comrade Mao Zedong has thoroughly refuted modern revisionism and proposed a complete general line for the international communist movement; he has expounded a complete set of strategies and tactics for defeating American imperialism and its running dogs; he has pointed out the path for the proletariat of all countries to achieve victory and for oppressed nations to gain complete liberation from colonialism; he has proposed a complete set of theories and policies to prevent revisionist elements from seizing the leadership of the party and the state in socialist countries and to prevent the restoration of capitalism, carrying the socialist revolution to completion."

	The resolution emphasizes: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all revolutionary work in Burma, especially Mao Zedong's theories on building a proletarian party, building a proletarian army, and people's war, which are the beacon for the victory of the Burmese revolution."

	The resolution states: "Opposing Mao Zedong Thought is opposing Marxism-Leninism." If one denies Mao Zedong Thought, "he is an opportunist, a revisionist."

	The resolution states: "For a proletarian revolutionary, for a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, the most primary and fundamental condition is to study and firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and work faithfully according to Mao Zedong Thought."

	The resolution states: "We resolutely oppose all those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought and fight against them, overthrowing them."

	The Central Political Bureau of the Burmese Communist Party has decided to launch a mass movement within the Burmese Communist Party to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The resolution calls for all forces within the Burmese Communist Party that represent Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to unite, oppose right opportunism and revisionism, and actively, broadly, and resolutely struggle to smash the bourgeois reactionary line and strive for the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line.

	The resolution states: "The 1964 line of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party, the line of 'winning the war and seizing power,' is completely in line with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. To win the ongoing revolutionary war, it is necessary to build our party into a proletarian revolutionary party—a Bolshevik party. It is necessary to mobilize the masses and thoroughly smash the 1955 line, which opposes the proletarian revolutionary line, abolishes revolutionary war, and advocates turning to the legal bourgeois reactionary line."

	The resolution states: "The Burmese people must, under the leadership of the proletariat, overthrow the main enemy—the Ne Win military dictatorship that practices bourgeois dictatorship, and strive for the victory of the revolutionary war led by the Burmese Communist Party."

　　缅共中央政治局决议指出中国文化大革命进一步推进世界革命进程
　　毛泽东同志是世界无产阶级领袖
    中国共产党是国际共运的先锋队
    毛泽东思想是我们时代的马克思列宁主义的顶峰。毛泽东同志指出了当代各国无产阶级取得胜利、被压迫民族从殖民主义桎梏下取得彻底解放的道路；提出了在社会主义国家防止修正主义分子篡夺党和国家领导权和防止资本主义复辟，把社会主义革命进行到底的一整套理论和政策。毛泽东思想是缅甸一切革命工作的指导方针。缅甸共产党决定开展学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的群众运动。缅甸人民必须高举“赢得战争、夺取政权”的旗帜，打倒奈温军事独裁政府，争取缅共领导的革命战争的胜利。
    新华社十日讯　仰光消息：缅甸共产党中央政治局关于伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命的决议指出：“伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命进一步推进了世界无产阶级革命的进程。毛泽东同志是世界无产阶级的领袖，中国共产党是国际共产主义运动的先锋队。”
    决议指出：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义、共产主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，必须明确地接受毛泽东思想是我们时代的马克思列宁主义的顶峰。”“毛泽东思想是缅甸一切革命工作的指导方针”。
    缅共中央政治局的这个决议，发表在缅共理论刊物《人民政权》一九六七年第二卷第二期上。
    决议首先阐述了中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，它指出：“伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命是二十世纪六十年代最重大的事件。它使中国的社会主义革命发展到一个更深入、更广泛的新阶段。在世界无产阶级革命史上写下了新篇章。”“伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的大革命。它是为了巩固和加强中国的无产阶级专政，也是为了推进世界无产阶级革命的进一步发展。”
    决议说，无产阶级专政，是马克思列宁主义的核心，是无产阶级革命的根本问题。在人民还没有取得政权的国家里，无产阶级和革命人民必须根据马克思列宁主义的暴力革命学说，砸烂资产阶级的国家机器，通过武装斗争建立无产阶级专政。在已经建立了无产阶级专政的国家，必须坚持无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底，防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政。
    决议指出：“毛泽东同志总结了世界无产阶级专政的全部历史经验，特别是总结了赫鲁晓夫集团背叛革命，在列宁的故乡——苏联复辟资本主义的惨痛教训，把无产阶级专政理论发展到了一个新的高峰，创建了一整套防止修正主义、加强无产阶级专政的理论。”毛泽东同志亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在解决如何巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟这一具有历史意义的问题中，为全世界无产阶级树立了一个新的榜样。
    决议说，在伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命期间，中国共产党内揪出了一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这是阶级斗争的规律。“揭露和打倒领导机关中的资产阶级代表人物，清楚地表明了中国共产党的伟大和强大的威力。”
    决议说：“在伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命中，我们缅甸无产阶级革命派也必须积极参加，同中国无产阶级革命派站在一起，绝对不能中立。因为伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命的敌人，也就是我们的敌人。”
    决议庄严地宣布：“高举‘赢得战争、夺取政权’的旗帜，同奈温军人独裁政府进行斗争的缅甸无产阶级革命派和革命人民，坚决支持毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线，坚决支持中国的革命工人、革命农民、革命干部同革命学生联合起来，在人民解放军帮助下，对走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争。”
    决议指出，中国共产党“八届十一中全会的最大特点是，高举了毛泽东思想伟大红旗，科学地阐明了毛泽东思想在马克思列宁主义发展史上的地位，以及毛泽东思想的深远意义。”
    决议高度评价毛泽东思想对发展马克思列宁主义作出的伟大贡献，它说，毛泽东思想是在同现代修正主义进行针锋相对的斗争中发展起来的。“毛泽东同志彻底地驳斥了现代修正主义，并为国际共产主义运动提出了完整的总路线；他论述了战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的一整套战略战术；指出了当代各国无产阶级取得胜利、被压迫民族从殖民主义桎梏下取得彻底解放的道路；提出了在社会主义国家防止修正主义分子篡夺党和国家领导权和防止资本主义复辟，把社会主义革命进行到底的一整套理论和政策。”
    决议强调：“毛泽东思想是缅甸一切革命工作的指导方针，特别是毛泽东同志关于建设无产阶级政党、建设无产阶级军队和人民战争的理论，更是缅甸革命取得胜利的指路明灯。”
    决议说：“反对毛泽东思想就是反对马克思列宁主义。”如果否认毛泽东思想，“那他就是机会主义者，是修正主义者。”
    决议说：“对于一个无产阶级革命者，对于一个无产阶级革命事业的接班人来说，最首要、最基本的条件，就是要学习并牢牢掌握毛泽东思想，按照毛泽东思想忠实地工作。”
  决议说：“我们坚决反对一切反毛泽东思想的人，同他们进行斗争，把他们打倒。”
    缅共中央政治局决定在缅甸共产党内，开展学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的群众运动，决议号召缅甸共产党内所有代表马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的力量团结起来，反对右倾机会主义和修正主义；为粉碎资产阶级反动路线，争取无产阶级革命路线的胜利，而进行积极的、广泛的和坚决的斗争。
    决议说：“缅甸共产党中央委员会的一九六四年路线，即‘赢得战争、夺取政权’的路线是完全符合马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的。为了赢得目前正在进行的革命战争，必须把我党建设成一个无产阶级的革命政党——布尔什维克党。”“必须发动群众，彻底粉碎一九五五年路线——反对无产阶级革命路线、取消革命战争、主张转入合法的资产阶级反动路线。”
    决议说：“缅甸人民必须在无产阶级领导下，打倒主要敌人——实行资产阶级专政的奈温军事独裁政府，争取缅甸共产党领导的革命战争的胜利。”
