The issue of academic style is a question of the thought method for leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members. It is a question of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. It is a question of the work attitude of all Party comrades. Since it is like this, the issue of academic style is a very important issue, it is the first important issue.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be implemented to the letter, every sentence must be carried out.

The support-left personnel of the 8341 Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory held a discussion on the newspaper's editorial "Vigorously Conduct Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes."

A Xinhua News Agency report on the 24th: The support-left personnel of the 8341 Unit stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory, who are responsible for conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes, have seriously studied the editorial "Vigorously Conduct Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes" published in the People's Daily. In a heated discussion, they unanimously agreed that establishing a revolutionary academic style of linking theory with practice is the most important issue in conducting study classes. The factory's study classes have paid attention to this point, not only promoting the revolutionary masses to achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in terms of organization, but also consolidating revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in terms of ideology.

	Unlimited Love for Chairman Mao's Works
	Is the Fundamental Prerequisite for Linking Theory with Practice

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Some people have read some Marxist books and think they have knowledge, but they have not really absorbed it, it has not taken root in their minds, they cannot apply it, and their class feelings are still old." Everyone pointed out in the discussion that to solve the problem of linking theory with practice, we must first solve the problem of class feelings. In the past, some people thought that studying Chairman Mao's works, whether to study or not, was a matter of attitude, and whether to use or not, was a matter of level. This is wrong. Studying Chairman Mao's works, whether to use or not, is a fundamental stance issue, a fundamental attitude issue, an issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Studying but not using, saying but not doing, is completely wrong. As long as we have unlimited class feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, firmly believe that with Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as weapons, and with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as a guide, there is no problem in the world that cannot be solved, we can read Chairman Mao's books, we can take root in our minds, we can learn and use, see immediate results, and achieve the linking of theory with practice. They paid special attention to the first class. The first class is to correct the learning attitude and declare to Chairman Mao. Make all students realize that this is the learning opportunity given by Chairman Mao, it is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest care, and greatest education for oneself, it is for oneself to advance better on the revolutionary road in the future, and to be sincere and honest in learning, to learn and use, to be consistent in words and deeds, and to do what one says. They also conducted class education through recalling bitterness and sweetness, aroused class feelings, and raised the awareness of linking theory with practice. For every instruction from Chairman Mao, they carried out those they understood and also carried out those they did not understand temporarily, executing while deepening their understanding.

	Practicing Self-Criticism
	Is an Important Aspect of Linking Theory with Practice

In the discussion, everyone also pointed out that guiding the students to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out serious self-criticism on the shortcomings and errors that appeared in the past more than a year of the Cultural Revolution is an important aspect of implementing the revolutionary good academic style of linking theory with practice. Studying Chairman Mao's works, learning and using, first of all, using to transform the subjective world, otherwise, it is impossible to truly link theory with practice. Everyone talked about how, at the beginning of the study class, some students lacked the spirit of self-criticism and could not expose and fight against the "self." Such learning cannot link theory with practice and cannot solve problems. In response to this situation, the support-left personnel organized them to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, emphasizing that they should follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "carrying out open, mass self-criticism (each side criticizes only itself, not the other side)" and take "fighting the self and criticizing revisionism" as the key, doing more self-criticism. The support-left personnel also inspired them to always remember to bring their own problems during learning, to put themselves in, to voluntarily expose the self, to voluntarily criticize, to voluntarily fight, to voluntarily revolutionize, and to fight a battle of annihilation in breaking the self. To help the students better link theory with practice, the support-left personnel, according to the development of the situation, selected key issues to be solved for each study class, guiding them to carry out self-criticism, break the self, and establish the public. For example, before and after achieving revolutionary great unity, they mobilized the students to launch an attack on petty-bourgeois factionalism; before and after achieving revolutionary three-in-one combination, they focused on helping cadres and leaders of mass organizations to solve the problem of correctly treating themselves and correctly treating the masses, and helping the masses to solve the problem of correctly treating cadres; after establishing the revolutionary committee, they emphasized taking "fighting the self and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and doing a good job in struggle-criticism-transformation.

Everyone listed many facts to illustrate that guiding the students to carry out serious self-criticism can achieve the best results in learning and using, and see immediate results. At the beginning of achieving revolutionary great unity, the original leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations still had some distrust of each other. After carrying out serious self-criticism in the study class, each exposed their factional activities, criticized themselves, thoroughly exposed the factionalism, and consolidated the revolutionary great unity. The support-left comrades said in the discussion with deep feelings: Following Chairman Mao's teachings, guiding the students to carry out serious and not perfunctory self-criticism is the fundamental method for the students to consciously link theory with practice and transform the subjective world.

	Go to the Masses to Absorb Nutrition
	Is an Important Way to Link Theory with Practice

The support-left personnel unanimously agreed in the discussion: In the past, some cadres made mistakes because they were detached from the masses. Organizing cadres and masses to study together and fight the self and criticize revisionism together not only strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses but also helped cadres establish a good academic style of linking theory with practice.

Everyone unanimously pointed out that in the study class, the support-left personnel should inspire the cadres to correctly treat the masses. Only by letting their thoughts meet the masses and absorbing nutrition from the masses can they link with reality, know which of their thoughts do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, and take the masses' practice as the standard for examination; only in this way can they fiercely fight against the "self" and transform their thoughts. Many cadres deeply felt: "In the past, because of being detached from reality and leaving Mao Zedong Thought, I regarded myself as a hero. Now I truly realize that the masses are the real heroes. In the future, I must go deep into the masses and be a lifelong student of the masses."

The support-left personnel also pointed out that when educating cadres to link theory with practice, they must not isolate the study class and the entire factory's masses from the movement's reality, making the cadres "reflect in seclusion." On the one hand, they mobilized the entire factory's masses to care about the study class, often sending Chairman Mao's quotations to the cadres in the study class, encouraging the cadres to stand out; on the other hand, they inspired the cadres to dare to expose themselves and fight the self in the entire factory's meeting, encouraging the cadres to recognize a little, check a little, change a little, do a little, encouraging the cadres to care about the factory's movement, dare to stand out to work, and transform themselves in the storm. Therefore, the study class also stipulated a period of time for the cadres to go deep into the workshops to listen to opinions. In this way, the cadres are in the study class but their hearts are connected with the entire factory's masses. Even if the cadres leave the study class, the support-left personnel still often inspire them to transform themselves among the masses. A deputy factory director, although he had great resistance in the movement, due to insisting on linking with reality and transforming his thoughts in the study class, daring to go to the masses to fiercely fight the self, and actively working, quickly gained the masses' understanding. Now he has been elected by the masses as the deputy director of the revolutionary committee.

Cadres believe in the masses, the masses help the cadres, cadres and masses together, everyone is a student, everyone is also a teacher, the study class presents a new atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness.

	Support-Left Personnel Should Take the Lead in Establishing a Revolutionary Good Academic Style

The support-left personnel specially pointed out that to establish a revolutionary good academic style of linking theory with practice in the study class, they must take the lead. First of all, they must put themselves among the masses, be the masses' small students, and not think that they are managing others, leading others, and standing above the students, pointing fingers at the students; even for comrades who have made mistakes, they can only persuade, not force, and must study and carry out self-criticism and fight the self and criticize revisionism together with the masses. Everyone said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the workers and peasants, can we truly learn it." We must take the process of conducting study classes as the best opportunity to study Mao Zedong Thought and transform our worldview. We must, together with the broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres, establish the revolutionary good academic style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao.

### 毛主席的最新指示要条条落实句句照办  八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员座谈本报社论《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》

专栏：

    学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。						毛泽东	
    毛主席的最新指示要条条落实句句照办
    八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员座谈本报社论《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》
    新华社二十四日讯八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂负责办毛泽东思想学习班的支左人员，认真地学习了《人民日报》社论《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》。他们在热烈的座谈中一致认为，建立理论联系实际的革命好学风，是办好学习班的最重要问题。厂里办的学习班，注意坚持了这一条，不但从组织上促进了革命群众实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合，而且从思想上巩固了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
      无限热爱毛主席著作
        是理论联系实际的根本前提
    毛主席教导我们：“有些人读了一些马克思主义的书，自以为有学问了，但是并没有读进去，并没有在头脑里生根，不会应用，阶级感情还是旧的。”大家在座谈中一致指出，要解决理论联系实际，首先要解决阶级感情问题。过去有人以为，学习毛主席著作，学不学是态度问题，用不用是水平问题，这是不对的。学习毛主席著作，用还是不用，是根本立场问题，根本态度问题，是忠不忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想的问题。学了不用，说了不做，是完全错误的。只要对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想具有无限热爱的阶级感情，坚信有了毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示作为武器，有了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线作为指针，世界上没有解决不了的问题，对毛主席的书就能读进去，就能在头脑里生根，就能学了就用，立竿见影，做到理论联系实际。他们非常注意上好学习班的第一课。第一课就是端正学习态度，向毛主席表决心。使全体学员认识到这是毛主席给的学习机会，是毛主席对自己的最大关怀、最大爱护、最大教育，是为了使自己在今后的革命道路上更好地前进，决心在学习中忠诚老实，学了就用，言行一致，说到做到。他们还通过忆苦思甜，进行阶级教育，激发阶级感情，提高理论联系实际的自觉性。对毛主席每一个指示，做到理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行，边执行边加深理解。
      实行自我批评
        是理论联系实际的重要方面
    在座谈中大家还一致指出，引导学员以毛泽东思想为武器，对自己在一年多来文化大革命中出现的某些缺点、错误，实行认真的自我批评，这是贯彻理论联系实际的革命好学风的重要方面。学习毛主席著作，学了就用，用，首先要用于改造主观世界，否则，就不可能真正做到理论联系实际。大家谈到，在开办学习班之初，有些学员缺乏自我批评精神，对“私”字亮不出，斗不狠。这样学习，不可能做到理论联系实际，不可能解决问题。针对这种情况，支左人员组织他们反复学习毛主席的最新指示，强调要按照毛主席关于“实行公开的群众性的自我批评（各方面只批评自己，不批评对方）”的教导，以“斗私，批修”为纲，多做自我批评。支左人员还启发他们在学习中时刻不忘带着自己的问题，都要把自己摆进去，要自觉亮私，自觉批判，自觉斗争，自觉革命，在破私中打进攻战。为了帮助学员更好地做到理论联系实际，支左人员根据形势的发展，有针对性地给每期学习班选择要解决的重点问题，引导他们实行自我批评，破私立公。例如，实现革命大联合前后，发动学员向小资产阶级派性开火；实现革命三结合前后，则重点帮助干部和群众组织负责人解决正确对待自己和正确对待群众，帮助群众解决正确对待干部的问题；成立革命委员会之后，强调以“斗私，批修”为纲，搞好斗批改。
    大家列举许多事实说明，引导学员实行认真的自我批评，最能收到学用结合、立竿见影的效果。实现革命大联合之初，原两大革命群众组织负责人互相还都有些不放心。经过在学习班认真实行自我批评，各自把派性活动和盘托出，自己批判，彻底搞臭了派性，巩固了革命大联合。支左同志在座谈中深有体会地说：遵照毛主席的教导，引导学员实行认真的而不是敷衍的自我批评，是使学员做到自觉地理论联系实际，改造主观世界的根本方法。
    到群众中去吸取营养
        是理论联系实际的重要途径
    支左人员在讨论中一致认为：过去有些干部犯错误，就是因为脱离了群众。组织干部和群众一起学习，一起斗私批修，既密切了干群关系，也帮助干部树立理论联系实际的好学风。
    大家一致指出，在学习班里，支左人员要启发干部正确对待群众，只有让自己的思想同群众见面，从群众中吸取营养，才能联系实际，知道自己哪些思想不符合毛泽东思想，把群众的实践作为检查的标尺；才能狠斗“私”字，改造思想。很多干部深有体会地说：“过去因为脱离实际，离开了毛泽东思想，把自己当成英雄，现在真正认识到群众是真正的英雄。今后，一定要深入群众，做一辈子群众的小学生。”
    支左人员还指出，教育干部理论联系实际时，决不能把学习班和全厂群众同运动实际隔离开来，使干部“闭门思过”。他们一方面发动全厂群众关心学习班，经常给学习班的干部送毛主席语录，鼓励干部站出来；另一方面启发干部敢于到全厂大会上斗私亮相，鼓励干部认识一点，检查一点，改一点，做一点，鼓励干部关心厂里的运动，敢于站出来工作，在大风雨中改造自己。因此，学习班还规定一段时间让干部深入车间听取意见。这样使干部身在学习班里，心却连着全厂群众。即使干部走出了学习班，支左人员还是经常启发他们在群众中改造自己。有个副厂长虽然在运动中有很大抵触情绪，由于在学习班里坚持联系实际，改造思想，敢于到群众中去狠斗私心，积极工作，很快得到群众谅解。现在已经被群众选为革委会副主任了。
    干部相信群众，群众帮助干部，干部和群众一起，人人是学生，人人又是教员，学习班呈现出一片团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的新气象。
    支左人员要带头建立革命好学风
    支左人员特别指出，要学习班建立理论联系实际的革命好学风，自己必须带头。首先要把自己置身于群众之中，当群众的小学生，不要以为自己是管人家的，是领导人家的，凌驾于学员之上，对学员指手划脚；就是对犯过错误的同志也是一样，只能说服，不能压服，必须和群众一块学习，一块开展自我批评，一块斗私批修。大家说：毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”我们要把办学习班的过程，作为学习毛泽东思想，改造自己世界观的最好的机会。要同广大革命职工、革命干部一起，建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风。
