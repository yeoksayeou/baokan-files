Chairman Mao directs military to include soldiers in study classes
The significance of improving relations between cadres and the masses is profound for the entire Party, the nation, and the military
Shanghai-based Air Force swiftly implements Chairman Mao's directive, presenting a new atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, December 11 -- According to a report from the *Liberation Army Daily*, our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Military study classes should include soldiers." The Shanghai-based Air Force units have earnestly and swiftly implemented this latest directive from Chairman Mao. In organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, various units and departments have widely included soldiers. Cadres and soldiers together discuss the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, presenting a new atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness in the troops.

	When the great directive from Chairman Mao on including soldiers in military study classes reached this unit, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers were overjoyed and the entire camp was filled with excitement. Everyone enthusiastically hailed this as the greatest political concern and trust from our great leader Chairman Mao. Many soldiers excitedly said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and understands our soldiers' feelings the best." Many cadres excitedly said, "With soldiers participating in the study classes, it will help us better understand Chairman Mao's latest directives and better engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism." Comrades wrote determination letters and pledges, vowing to Chairman Mao to complete the glorious study tasks, earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, further promote thought reform, and firmly establish the absolute authority of the great commander Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of great Mao Zedong Thought.

	To resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest directive on including soldiers in military study classes, the Party Committee of the Shanghai-based Air Force held an emergency meeting to discuss and study. Everyone deeply felt that Chairman Mao's great teaching that "in a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience" is an absolute truth. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized by various units and departments all included soldiers. Cadres and soldiers studied, lived, worked, and entertained together, carrying forward the glorious tradition of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

	They mobilized the masses, daring to experiment, and created flexible and diverse study methods. (1) The Mao Zedong Thought study classes organized by various units and departments generally mixed cadres, leading cadres, and soldiers into groups to study and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism together. Soldiers participated in the leadership of study classes and study groups. (2) Regiments universally organized study classes under the leadership of the regimental Party branch, with cadres, old soldiers, and new soldiers forming study guidance groups. (3) The Party committees at the regiment level and above also included soldiers and ordinary cadres in their study groups focused on studying Chairman Mao's works. Some units organized study classes in the regiments or among the masses to better learn from the soldiers and the masses.

	The Shanghai-based Air Force, through practice, deeply felt that this study class carried forward and developed the glorious tradition of mutual teaching between officers and soldiers that Chairman Mao taught more than twenty years ago. In the new situation where Mao Zedong Thought study classes are universally organized across the country, Chairman Mao's great directive not only has great practical significance for the entire military, the Party, and the nation in organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes but also has profound strategic significance for the entire military, the Party, and the nation in further improving superior-subordinate relations, engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and achieving thought reform. Recently, this unit mobilized the masses to widely summarize the benefits of including soldiers in study classes. The initial understanding is: (1) It further strengthened the relationship between officers and soldiers and enhanced the unity between cadres and soldiers. The officialdom in cadres was eliminated, and class feelings increased. Many soldiers said, "In the past, we had little contact with cadres and felt a bit restrained when we saw them; now, studying and living together with cadres, freely expressing opinions, and discussing issues, we feel very close." (2) Many cadres, through studying and living with soldiers, more deeply felt the soldiers' boundless love for Chairman Mao, boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought, and boundless love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, soldiers dared to expose their private thoughts and criticize themselves, and also dared to raise sharp criticisms of cadres. Many cadres, with the help and encouragement of soldiers, increased their awareness of exposing their thoughts and engaging in self-criticism, promoting thought reform. (3) Through joint study, cadres learned a lot about the situation at the grassroots level, which was very helpful in enriching leadership thoughts and improving leadership styles. (4) Using the old to guide the new, passing on traditions, and carrying forward styles is a good method for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. (5) Through study, the experience of the study classes can be directly brought back to the grassroots level, further promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the regiments.

　　毛主席指示军队办学习班要有战士参加
　　对全党全国全军搞好干群关系意义深远
　　驻上海空军雷厉风行执行毛主席指示呈现团结紧张严肃活泼新气象
    新华社十一日讯　据《解放军报》报道：伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“军队办学习班要有战士参加。”驻上海空军部队认真、迅速地贯彻执行毛主席这一最新指示，各机关、部队在大办毛泽东思想学习班中，广泛地吸收战士参加。干部战士共同讨论无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，共同进行斗私批修，使部队呈现一片团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的新气象。
    伟大领袖毛主席关于军队办学习班要有战士参加的伟大指示传到这个部队后，广大干部战士欢欣鼓舞，军营内外一片欢腾。大家热烈欢呼这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们政治上的最大关怀，最大信任。许多战士激动地说：“我们伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最理解我们战士的心情。”许多干部兴奋地说：“学习班有战士参加，可以帮助我们更好地理解毛主席的最新指示，更好地进行斗私批修。”同志们纷纷地写决心书、保证书，向毛主席宣誓，保证完成光荣的学习任务，认真活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，进一步促进思想革命化，大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    为了坚决贯彻毛主席关于军队办学习班要有战士参加的最新指示，驻上海空军部队党委连夜召开党委会进行讨论研究。大家深深体会到，毛主席关于“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”的伟大教导，是千真万确的真理。各机关、部队开办的毛泽东思想学习班，都吸收战士参加。干部战士同学习，同生活，同劳动，同娱乐，发扬了抗大的光荣传统。
    他们发动群众，大胆尝试，创造了灵活多样的学习形式。（一）各机关、部队举办的毛泽东思想学习班，一般干部、领导干部、战士混合编组，一起学习，一起斗私批修。战士参加学习班和学习小组的领导工作。（二）连队普遍办学习班，在连队党支部领导下，由干部、老战士、新战士组成学习指导小组。（三）团以上党委学习毛主席著作中心小组，也吸收战士和一般干部参加。有些机关举办的学习班，为了更好地向战士学习，向群众学习，还搬到连队去办，搬到群众中去办。
    驻上海空军部队通过实践，深深体会到，这种学习班继承和发扬了毛主席早在二十多年以前就教导的官兵互教的光荣传统。在当前全国上下普遍举办毛泽东思想学习班的新形势下，毛主席的这一伟大指示，不仅对全军、全党、全国办好毛泽东思想学习班具有伟大的现实意义，而且对全军、全党、全国进一步搞好上下级关系，斗私批修，实现思想革命化具有深远的战略意义。最近，这个部队发动群众广泛地总结了办学习班有战士参加的好处。初步体会是：（一）进一步密切了官兵关系，加强了干部与战士的团结。干部官气被打掉了，阶级感情增加了。许多战士说：“过去和干部接触少，看到了就有点拘束；现在和干部一起学习，一起生活，自由发表意见，争论问题，感到非常亲切。”（二）许多干部通过和战士同学习，同生活，更加深刻地体会到广大战士无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想，无限热爱毛主席的革命路线。在斗私批修中，战士敢于亮私、斗私，也敢于对干部提出尖锐的批评。许多干部在战士的帮助和鞭策下，提高了亮思想斗私心的自觉性，促进了思想革命化。（三）通过共同学习，干部了解到基层的大量情况，对于丰富领导思想，改进领导作风，起到很大的作用。（四）以老带新，传传统，带作风，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的一个好方法。（五）通过学习，能直接把学习班的经验带回基层，进一步推动连队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。
