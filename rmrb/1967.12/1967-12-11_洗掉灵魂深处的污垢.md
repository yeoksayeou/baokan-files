After a day's work, Li Wenzhong did not wash his work clothes with the soldiers. He felt uncomfortable in his heart. Why couldn't he do this after becoming a platoon leader? He decided:

	Wash Away the Filth from the Soul

The sunset reflected on the verdant peaks, and the sound of the retreat signal echoed through the valley. Except for five people who went down to the stream to wash their work clothes, the rest of the soldiers in the Fourth Platoon sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations as they descended the mountain. Platoon leader Li Wenzhong also wanted to stay behind and wash his work clothes with the soldiers, but he was persuaded to leave.

Li Wenzhong walked along the mountain path, thinking: When he was a squad leader, he did all the work with the soldiers. Why couldn't he do this now? He asked himself: If you want to stay behind and wash your work clothes, why did you waver when your comrades persuaded you? What is it that is stirring in the depths of your soul? Is it that, after being promoted to platoon leader, you have secretly nurtured a sense of special privilege? Yes, the reason is there. Li Wenzhong recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people." He thought: Since we are servants of the people, we cannot have any sense of special privilege, not even for a moment. We cannot detach ourselves from the masses. The change in position is only a need of the revolution. The ordinary soldier's spirit must not change. Washing work clothes may be a small matter, but distancing oneself from the masses and not sharing their joys and sorrows is a big matter. This matter must be a high alert for me. Li Wenzhong stopped in his tracks, took out his red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and turned to page 240. It was as if Chairman Mao was by his side, admonishing him: "The imperialist prophets, based on the changes in the Soviet Union, also place their hopes of 'peaceful evolution' on the third or fourth generation of the Chinese Communist Party. We must make this prophecy of the imperialists completely bankrupt. We must, from top to bottom, universally, and continuously, pay attention to cultivating and training successors to the revolutionary cause." Li Wenzhong thought, Chairman Mao's teachings are so profound. I must engrave them word for word in my mind. Li Wenzhong thought of this, turned around, and ran swiftly down to the stream.

Li Wenzhong recounted the process of his thought transformation to his comrades. He spoke earnestly: "I came back to work with everyone, not only to wash away the dirt on the work clothes, but more importantly, to wash away the dust that has accumulated in my mind."

### 洗掉灵魂深处的污垢

    一次收工，李文忠没有同战士一起洗工作服，心里总觉得不是滋味。为什么当排长以后就不能这样做了？他决心：
　　洗掉灵魂深处的污垢
    晚霞映着苍翠的山峰，收工的号声在山谷里回响。四排同志除了五个人到山下小河边去洗工作服外，其余的都唱着毛主席语录歌下山了。排长李文忠本来也想留下来跟战士们一起洗工作服，但被大家劝走了。
    李文忠沿着山道往前走着，心想：当班长的时候，什么工作都是和战士们一样干。现在为什么就不能这样做呢？他问自己：你要留下来洗工作服，为什么同志们一劝说就动摇了？是什么东西在灵魂深处活动着呢？是不是提升为排长了，暗暗滋长了特殊化的思想呢？对，原因就在这里。李文忠想起毛主席的教导：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。他想：既是人民的勤务员，就不能有任何特殊化的思想，一时一刻也不能脱离群众，职务的变化只是革命的需要，普通一兵的本色绝不能变，洗工作服虽然是件小事，和群众疏远，不能同甘共苦却是件大事。这件事必须引起自己的高度警惕。李文忠停下脚步，掏出红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，翻到第二百四十页，好象毛主席就在身边，谆谆嘱咐自己：“帝国主义的预言家们根据苏联发生的变化，也把‘和平演变’的希望，寄托在中国党的第三代或者第四代身上。我们一定要使帝国主义的这种预言彻底破产。我们一定要从上到下地、普遍地、经常不断地注意培养和造就革命事业的接班人。”李文忠想，毛主席他老人家的教导多深刻啊，要一字一句铭刻在脑子里。李文忠想到这里，转回头来，飞步向山下小河边跑去。
    李文忠向同志们叙述了思想变化的过程，他语重心长地说：“我回来跟大家一起劳动，不但要洗掉工作服上的污垢，更重要的是洗掉思想上沾染的灰尘。”
