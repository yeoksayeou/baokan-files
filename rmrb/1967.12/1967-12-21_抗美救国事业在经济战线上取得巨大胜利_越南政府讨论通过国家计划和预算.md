The Vietnamese government held a meeting in mid-December to discuss and approve the national plan and budget for 1968.

The government meeting's communiqué pointed out that despite the U.S. imperialists' intensified use of air and naval forces to launch frenzied attacks on North Vietnam, significant achievements have been made in fulfilling the goals set out in the national plan, such as maintaining and developing production, serving the battlefront, and ensuring the people's livelihood. The economic and defense potential of the socialist North has continued to strengthen during the war. This is a tremendous victory.

The government meeting called on all departments and localities to adopt the most resolute spirit of decisive battle and victory, to take the highest sense of responsibility, to fully mobilize the boundless capabilities of the people, and to successfully implement the 1968 national plan and budget, making new contributions to the defeat of American aggressors.
