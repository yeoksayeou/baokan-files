The paper industry has reported good news: the 1967 national production plan for paper used to print Chairman Mao's works and portraits has been exceeded, with output significantly higher than in previous years. Specifically, the production of offset paper for printing Chairman Mao's works has increased by over 40% compared to last year, reaching 2.35 times the amount produced in 1965. The production of gravure paper for printing Chairman Mao's portraits has also increased by 1.5 times compared to last year. This is a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. It not only ensures the printing needs for various editions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Mao Zedong's Poems," and paper for Chairman Mao's portraits this year but also lays a solid material foundation for printing more and better editions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and Chairman Mao's portraits next year.

Comrade Lin Biao has taught us that Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and dogmatism. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country. However, in the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the former Propaganda Department, Cultural Department, and First Light Industry Department not only fiercely obstructed and opposed the nationwide study of Chairman Mao's works and the large-scale publication of his works but also deliberately reduced the production of offset paper for printing Chairman Mao's works.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers in the paper industry have exposed and criticized these counter-revolutionary revisionists, leading to unprecedented political awareness and production enthusiasm. They say that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light of the revolution. The more the class enemies oppose the publication of Chairman Mao's works, the more we must strive to publish them in large quantities. Therefore, everyone is eager to contribute to the production of paper for Chairman Mao's works. From the First Light Industry Department to various levels of departments in charge of the paper industry, they all prioritize the production of paper for Chairman Mao's works, allocating as many machines, manpower, and resources as possible this year compared to previous years. Not only have paper mills like Jincheng and Tianjin, which previously produced offset paper, taken on heavier production tasks and made significant contributions, but many small mills that did not previously produce offset paper have also voluntarily taken on the production of paper for Chairman Mao's works. Some mills have overcome equipment and technical difficulties to successfully produce new varieties. The Huangtai Paper Mill in Shandong, the Beijing Pulp and Paper Experimental Factory, the Chaoyang Paper Mill, and the Tianjin Paper Mill No. 5 have all successively developed and produced thin offset paper.

In the production process of paper for Chairman Mao's works and portraits, relevant departments for raw material production, material supply, and transportation have also made important contributions. As long as it is related to the production of paper for Chairman Mao's works, materials are given priority arrangement.

    造纸工业战线职工全心全意为传播毛泽东思想贡献力量
    毛主席著作用纸生产计划超额完成
    毛主席像用的胶版纸比去年增长了一点五倍
    据新华社二十九日讯  造纸工业战线传出喜讯：一九六七年全国生产印制毛主席著作和毛主席像用纸计划超额完成，产量比过去有大幅度增长。其中毛主席著作用纸凸版纸，比去年提高百分之四十以上，相当于一九六五年的二点三五倍。印制毛主席像用的胶版纸，也比去年增长了一点五倍。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利。它不但保证了今年大量出版各种文版的《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》、《毛主席诗词》以及毛主席像用纸的需要，同时也为明年出版更多更好的《毛泽东选集》和毛主席像提供了雄厚的物质基础。
    林副主席教导我们：毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。但是在过去，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在旧中宣部、旧文化部、第一轻工业部的代理人，不但疯狂地阻挠和反对全国人民大学毛主席著作，反对大量出版毛主席著作，还极力削减印制毛主席著作的凸版纸的生产。
    无产阶级文化大革命开展以后，造纸工业战线上的广大革命职工对这批反革命修正主义分子进行了大揭发、大批判，政治觉悟和生产积极性空前高涨。他们说，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是指导革命的灯塔。阶级敌人越是反对出版毛主席著作，我们越要为大量出版毛主席著作竭尽全力。因而人人都争着为毛主席著作用纸的生产贡献力量。从第一轻工业部到地方各级主管造纸工业的部门，都把毛主席著作用纸的生产放在重要地位，用比往年尽可能多的设备、人力和物力，投入了毛主席著作用纸的生产。不仅过去生产凸版纸的金城、天津等造纸厂担负了较重的生产任务，作出了重要的贡献，而且很多过去没有生产凸版纸的小厂也主动承担毛主席著作用纸的生产任务。有些厂还克服了设备和技术条件的困难，成功地生产了新的品种。山东黄台造纸厂、北京制浆造纸试验厂、开原造纸厂、天津市造纸五厂等，都相继试制和生产出了薄凸版纸。
    在毛主席著作和毛主席像用纸的生产过程中，各有关原材料生产、物资供应和交通运输部门也作出了重要的贡献，只要是与毛主席著作用纸生产有关的物资，都给以优先安排。
