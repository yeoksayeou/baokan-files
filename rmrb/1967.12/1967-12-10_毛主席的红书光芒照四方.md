Recently, at a gathering in Lahore, West Pakistan, where Chinese films were screened, the renowned poet Taleeb Jalandhari held up two copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" with both hands and, in a state of excitement, recited a poem he had written in praise of Mao Zedong Thought to the audience. The poem was enthusiastically received by the listeners. The poem goes:

	The radiance of Mao Zedong's Little Red Book shines to all directions,
	The proletariat reads the Little Red Book,
	Dares to struggle against the oppressors,
	Settles accounts with the oppressors,
	Imperialists and their running dogs are doomed to perish.
	The radiance of Mao Zedong's Little Red Book shines to all directions,
	Reading Chairman Mao's Little Red Book inspires us,
	We fear neither hardships nor death.
	A bright future lies before us,
	Every sentence in the Little Red Book radiates the brilliant light of the red sun.
	The compass guiding the current proletarian revolution
	Is the great Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛主席的红书光芒照四方
    最近在西巴基斯坦莱雅普尔举行的放映中国电影的集会上，著名诗人塔列布·贾伦达里双手高举两本《毛主席语录》，激动地向观众朗诵了他写的一首赞扬毛泽东思想的诗，受到听众们的热烈欢迎。这首诗写道：
    毛泽东的红书光芒照四方，
    无产阶级读了红书，
    敢于同压迫者作斗争，
    向压迫者算账，
    帝国主义者及其同伙注定要灭亡。
    毛泽东的红书光芒照四方，
    读了毛主席的红书受鼓舞，
    不怕困难和死亡。
    光明的前途呈现在我们面前，
    红书里的每一段话都发射出红太阳的灿烂光芒。
    指导当前无产阶级革命的罗盘，
    就是伟大的毛泽东思想。
