Preliminary statistics show that a total of 510 enemy troops were annihilated, including 117 American invaders and 45 South Korean lackeys.

On the night of November 29, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of My Tho Province, with the support and cooperation of the local people, swiftly entered the city of My Tho, launching a fierce attack on various outposts near the puppet provincial headquarters, annihilating an enemy armored battalion and severely damaging an engineering battalion.
