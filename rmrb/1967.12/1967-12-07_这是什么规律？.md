    What is This Law?
    Deputy Squad Leader Yang Rengen

    The Chinese Khrushchov vigorously promotes the bourgeois worldview of selfishness and shamelessly calls it a "law." He says: "To suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage is a law of development in the opposite direction." These words are like foul dog shit wrapped in colorful paper. At first glance, they are dazzling, but upon smelling, they stink to high heaven.

    The "small loss" that the Chinese Khrushchov talks about is "letting others have the good things and taking the difficult tasks for ourselves." And "gaining a big advantage" is "the people will reward you," "it will be beneficial to you," "you can become a township cadre, county cadre, provincial cadre, or even go to the central government," "there will be great prospects in the future." In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchov, "suffering a small loss" is a means, and "gaining a big advantage" is his ultimate goal. What is the difference between this and the speculator's "investing to make a profit" and "making a fortune"? The "law of development" that the Chinese Khrushchov is so proud of is, in our eyes, revealed to be the speculator's "law of development." The Chinese Khrushchov applies this speculator's "law of development" to politics, aiming to achieve his evil goal of usurping the party and the country.

    Chairman Mao teaches us to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, which means to serve the people wholeheartedly and one hundred percent, without any selfish motives. Those who are full of the "self" character, the conspirators and plotters, no matter how they play tricks and deceive the party and the people, will ultimately be exposed by the party and the people. This is the "law of development" that is not subject to the will of people. The disgraceful end of the Chinese Khrushchov perfectly illustrates this point.

    这是什么规律？
    副班长　杨仁根
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力宣扬利己主义的资产阶级世界观，并且还厚颜无耻地称之为“规律”。他说：“吃点小亏，占大便宜，是向相反方向发展的规律。”这些话象包在花纸里的臭狗屎，乍一看，晃眼，闻一闻，臭气熏天。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“吃小亏”，就是“好事让人家些，困难的事我们拿来做。”而“占大便宜”呢，那就是“人民会给报酬的”，“对你们会有好处”，“当乡干部、县干部、省干部，也可以到中央”，“将来还有大发展”。在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，“吃小亏”是手段，“占大便宜”才是他的目的，这同投机奸商的“将本求利”、
  “一本万利”有什么两样？中国赫鲁晓夫自鸣得意的这个“发展的规律”，却被我们一碗清水看到底，原来是投机奸商“发展的规律”。中国赫鲁晓夫把这种投机奸商的“发展的规律”，运用到政治上来，就是要达到他篡党篡国的罪恶目的。
    毛主席教导我们要“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，就是要彻头彻尾地、百分之百地为人民服务，不带任何私心杂念。那些满身浸透了
  “私”字的野心家、阴谋家，尽管他会玩弄花招，欺骗党和人民，但终归要被党和人民揭露出来，这才是不以人们意志为转移的“发展的规律”。中国赫鲁晓夫的可耻下场，正好说明了这一点。
