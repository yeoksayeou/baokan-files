	United Under the Red Flag
	Five Good Soldier Zhong Xinmin

	In October of this year, my uncle came from Shandong to visit me at the unit. In the evening, he told me a story about our hometown during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution:

	The River East Production Team and the River West Production Team in our brigade used to be very united. Starting from the beginning of this year, due to the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the two teams became opposed to each other, often arguing over minor issues. Some members of the two teams wouldn't even speak to each other when they met. Although the lands of the two teams were adjacent, they insisted on digging a ditch in between and planting their respective "faction flags." When the brigade was building a dam to block the river, at the junction of the dam, the two teams each left a section. This matter was discovered by the "support agriculture" troops, who immediately called the cadres of the two teams to study together Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Following this, the community members went to the dam, filled in the "dividing ditch," and pulled out the "faction flags." Instead, they planted a "Quotations from Chairman Mao" flag at the boundary, with the words: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country—this is the basic guarantee that our cause will surely triumph." The community members, seeing Chairman Mao's teachings, all decided to promote unity between the two teams.

	Soon, Chairman Mao issued new instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest..." "We must wage a struggle against selfishness and revise and correct our mistakes." The community members of the two teams actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, each making self-criticisms. They said: We poor and lower-middle peasants are all bitter gourds on the same vine, blood brothers of the same class. If we are not united, we are falling into the trap of the class enemy. Thus, the two teams each wrote Chairman Mao's new instructions on a bright red "Quotations" flag.

	The next morning, the poor and lower-middle peasant community members of the two teams, holding high red flags, went to the field, checked each other's shortcomings, and exchanged "Quotations" flags. From then on, the community members of the two teams studied Chairman Mao's works together at the field before starting work, jointly struggled against selfishness and revised and corrected their mistakes. During the autumn harvest, when the River East Production Team was short of hands, the River West Production Team sent strong laborers to support them; when the River West Production Team lacked vehicles for delivering grain to the state, the River East Production Team sent vehicles to help with the transportation. It is said that the two teams are also planning to dig a "Unity Well" together!

    团结在红旗下
    五好战士　仲新民
    今年十月，俺叔从山东来部队看我，晚上讲了俺家乡在无产阶级文化大革命中发生的一个故事：
    俺们大队的河东生产队和河西生产队，过去很团结。从今年年初开始，因为受党内一小撮走资派的挑动，两个队对立起来，常常为一点小事就吵架。两个队有些社员见了面连话也不说。本来两个队的地都连在一起，却硬要从中间挖一条沟，插上各自的“派旗”。大队兴修拦河坝时，在坝的接连处，两队就各自留一段。这件事被“支农”的部队发现了，立即找两个队的干部，一块学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。接着，社员们就上拦河坝，填平了“分界沟”，并拔掉了“派旗”，另外把一面“毛主席语录旗”插到地界上，旗上写的是：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证”。社员们看到毛主席的教导，都决心搞好两队的团结。
    不久，毛主席发出了最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。……”“要斗私，批修”。两个队的社员积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，各自做了自我批评。他们说：我们贫农下中农都是一个藤上的苦瓜，是血肉相连的阶级兄弟，我们闹不团结，这是上了阶级敌人的当。于是两个队各自在一面鲜红的“语录旗”上，写上了毛主席的最新指示。
    第二天一早，两队的贫农下中农社员，高举红旗走到地头，互相检查了自己的缺点，互相赠送了“语录旗”。从此，两个队的社员上工干活前，一起在地头学习毛主席著作，共同斗私批修。秋收那阵子，河东生产队人手不够，河西生产队就挑选壮劳力去支援；河西生产队送交公粮车辆不够，河东生产队就出车帮助运送。听说两个队还准备合打一口“团结井”呢！
