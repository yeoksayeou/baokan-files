Under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shanghai's market in 1967 presented a prosperous scene. The entire market was abundant with goods, and prices were stable.

According to statistics from January to November, Shanghai's market social commodity retail sales increased by 8.4% compared to the same period last year. The retail sales of major commodities such as fresh pork, aquatic products, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, cigarettes, sugar, cotton cloth, socks, sweaters, wool, and bicycles all saw significant increases. Among them, the supply of fresh fruits reached an all-time high; the total sales of fresh pork reached the highest level since liberation eighteen years ago.

People's revolution is the locomotive of historical progress. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted the development of industry and agriculture. This year, both national and suburban Shanghai agriculture achieved bumper harvests. In terms of industry, the production of many products needed for national construction and people's livelihood in Shanghai this year has increased to varying degrees compared to the same period last year. This is reflected in the procurement of consumer goods, where items such as machine-made paper, radios, batteries, pens, aluminum pots, watches, bedsheets, towels, clocks, as well as live pigs, vegetables, and sugar, all had procurement figures exceeding last year. Especially live pigs, this year's supply was particularly high.

With the golden monkey wielding the thousand-pound rod, the jade sky clears the myriad dust. After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shanghai's market has undergone a fundamental change. Before the Cultural Revolution, major streets such as Nanjing Road, Huaihai Road, and Xizang Road, due to the tolerance and support of the biggest group of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanghai, Chen Pishan and Cao Qichou, some areas became centers for promoting decadent capitalist lifestyles. The shops were filled with low-level advertisements promoting eating, drinking, and entertainment, as well as strange clothes and high-end cosmetics that catered to the needs of the exploiting classes. During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards and revolutionary young soldiers, together with the broad revolutionary masses on the financial and trade front, swept away the "Four Olds," making Shanghai's market face a new look. Now, in every shop window, big or small, there are portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao. Major commercial centers like the No. 1 Department Store in the city center have set up special counters for the works of Chairman Mao, sending millions of copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the revolutionary people.

The broad revolutionary masses on Shanghai's financial and trade front, following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, have extensively and deeply studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle and the reform of their units. The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses in the financial and trade system have also held city-wide criticism and struggle meetings, criticizing China's Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle," "profit-first," and the revisionist line of building the party. This has greatly strengthened the class struggle consciousness of revolutionary workers and highlighted proletarian politics. Together with the revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses throughout the city, they have repelled the economic wind blown by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters in society, effectively striking at speculative activities, safeguarding the socialist planned economy, safeguarding the normal progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and safeguarding Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, making the entire Shanghai market very stable.

Through more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers on the financial and trade front have further understood the great significance of the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." They have realized that the market is one of the important arenas of class struggle, and that doing business work must highlight proletarian politics and never forget class struggle. Standing behind the counter is standing on the front line of class struggle, and one must use the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything and command everything. Many revolutionary workers are striving to become propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. They actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought at the counter. The broad revolutionary workers on the financial and trade front are determined to turn the socialist market into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    文化大革命促进了工农业生产的发展
    上海市场繁荣兴旺
    一至十一月商品零售额比去年同期增长百分之八点四
    据新华社上海二十九日电　在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势下，一九六七年上海市场呈现一派繁荣景象。整个市场商品充沛，物价稳定。
    据一到十一月统计，上海市场社会商品零售额比去年同期增长百分之八点四。鲜猪肉、水产品、鲜菜、鲜瓜果、卷烟、食糖、棉布、袜子、球衫、呢绒、自行车等主要商品的零售额，都有较大幅度的增长。其中鲜瓜果上市量创历史上最高纪录；鲜猪肉的销售总金额达到了解放十八年来的最高水平。
    人民革命是历史前进的火车头。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命促进了工农业生产的发展。今年全国和上海郊区的农业都获得了大丰收。工业方面，今年上海生产的国家建设和人民生活需要的许多产品的产量，都比去年同期有不同程度的增长。反映在消费商品收购方面，机制纸、收音机、电池、钢笔、铝锅、手表、床单、毛巾、钟，以及生猪、蔬菜、食糖等副食品，今年收购数字都超过了去年。特别是生猪，今年到货特别多。
    金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命，上海市场面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化。南京路、淮海路、西藏路等各条主要街道，在文化大革命前，由于党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流的纵容和支持，有些地段，成了宣扬腐朽的资本主义生活方式的集中点，商店里摆满了提倡吃喝玩乐的低级广告，以及适应剥削阶级需要的奇装异服、高级化妆品等等。在文化大革命中，红卫兵革命小将同财贸战线上广大革命职工一道，横扫“四旧”，使上海市场面貌焕然一新。现在，不论大小商店的橱窗里，都高悬着毛主席像和毛主席语录。市中心第一百货商店等主要商场，都增辟了毛主席著作专柜，把千千万万册《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》，送到革命人民手中。
    上海财贸战线上的广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大学大用毛主席著作，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，广泛、深入地开展了革命大批判和本单位斗批改的群众运动。财贸系统无产阶级革命派、革命群众还多次召开了全市性的批判斗争大会，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”“利润挂帅”及修正主义的建党路线，从而大大加强了革命职工的阶级斗争观点，突出了无产阶级政治。他们同全市无产阶级革命派、革命群众一起，击退了党内一小撮走资派及社会上牛鬼蛇神刮起的经济主义妖风，有力地打击了投机倒把活动，保卫了社会主义的计划经济，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命的正常进行，保卫了毛主席的革命路线，使整个上海市场十分稳定。
    通过一年多无产阶级文化大革命运动，财贸战线革命职工进一步领会了伟大领袖毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”这一教导的伟大意义。他们认识到，市场是阶级斗争的重要阵地之一，做商业工作一定要突出无产阶级政治，一定要念念不忘阶级斗争。站在柜台边，就是站在阶级斗争的前哨阵地，一定要用伟大的毛泽东思想指导一切，统帅一切。许多革命职工争当毛泽东思想宣传员，他们在柜台上积极宣传毛泽东思想。财贸战线广大革命职工决心把社会主义市场办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
