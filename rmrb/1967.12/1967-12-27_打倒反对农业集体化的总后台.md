Title: Overthrow the Mastermind Behind the Opposition to Agricultural Collectivization

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The agricultural cooperativization movement, from the very beginning, has been a severe struggle of ideas and politics." Chairman Mao's words truly strike a chord in our hearts. From the very start of the cooperativization movement, not only did the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements fiercely resist, but also the bourgeois agents who had infiltrated the Party and the government jumped out to oppose and sabotage it. They were all in cahoots, running around, spreading malicious rumors, igniting evil fires, stirring up black waves, and pouring cold water, doing all sorts of evil deeds both openly and secretly. Now it is abundantly clear that the root of all these evils, the mastermind behind them all, is China's Khrushchev and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party.

In 1962, just as we, the broad masses of militia and commune members, were marching forward with high spirits under the guidance of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes—the three red banners—our biggest capitalist-roader within the Party shouted loudly that "as long as it increases production, individual farming is also acceptable; whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat." He also, with his eyes closed, bad-mouthed, saying: "The peasants have lost confidence in the collective economy." This is blatantly sabotaging agricultural collectivization, slandering the collective economy's inability to increase production, urging us to go back to individual farming, and suffer twice the hardships. We will not listen to this, not even a little bit!

The more the enemy opposes the People's Communes, sabotages the collective economy, and undermines the foundations of socialism, the more we must strive to run the People's Communes well, manage the collective economy well, and strengthen the foundations of socialism, thus smashing the plots of the class enemies.

Following Chairman Mao's teachings on "The People's Communes are good," we have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and win victory." We have made the collective economy more prosperous day by day and run the People's Communes better year by year. Our brigade, relying on the collective strength of the People's Communes, has undertaken water conservancy projects, built the North Ling Great Water Gate, established an electric irrigation station, and purchased hand-held tractors. Truly: there is an electric irrigation machine by the river, a threshing machine at the threshing ground, a radio on the wall, and the commune members are happy and smiling! The People's Communes are big and public, with many people, great strength, high morale, and plenty of enthusiasm. Resisting natural disasters is no problem. For example, this summer and autumn, at the critical moment of crop growth, there was no rain for a hundred days, continuous high temperatures, cracked land, withered crops, and yellowing leaves. The broad masses fearlessly fought against the drought, displaying "a spirit of daring to fight bravely, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting..." Electric irrigation, machine threshing, well digging, water wheel treading, manure carrying, and water scooping, "three carts and six buckets" were all mobilized, with men, women, old, and young all joining the battle. After four continuous anti-drought struggles, the crops that had turned yellow and withered leaves grew green and lush again! In the end, we forced the heavens to yield golden corn and white cotton, achieving a bumper harvest in a drought year, with both grain and cotton yields high.

A rare and severe drought was conquered by the broad revolutionary masses, demonstrating the superiority of the People's Communes being big and public. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Looking back to 1932, here it rained for sixty days, and the aftermath of the disaster was: the land was dry three feet deep, covered with salt frost, crops withered, and not a single grain was harvested. People sold their children, fled in all directions, and bones were left in foreign lands! Comparing the past with the present, how can we not sing from the bottom of our hearts:

	Individual farming sways with the wind,
	Collectives can withstand great storms;
	The People's Communes are golden bridges,
	All thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership!

History has placed the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party on the dock. All these living facts have given him a resounding slap in the face! His chanting of the "white cat, black cat" scripture, cursing the collective economy, and attempting to dismantle the People's Communes is a futile dream! Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "anything reactionary, you don't attack it, it won't fall," we have taken up the iron broom of Mao Zedong Thought, sweeping the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, along with his reactionary fallacy of "whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat," into the garbage heap and fertilizer field!

Editor's Note:

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party spread the reactionary fallacy of "whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat" to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. The militia and commune members of the "Red Flag Militia" in Jiaoqiao, Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, taking the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines as the key link, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, based on their personal experiences, exposed from all aspects the reactionary nature of this fallacy and the evil intentions of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party in spreading this fallacy. They are conducting a good revolutionary criticism.

One of the major tasks of the current rural Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to further carry out revolutionary criticism. Through revolutionary criticism, we must expose and denounce the reactionary fallacies such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "exploitation is beneficial," "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," and "peach garden experience" promoted by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, as well as their various counter-revolutionary crimes of restoring capitalism. We must combine this with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our own units to eliminate their poisonous influence. In the revolutionary criticism, we must further study the great leader Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on the socialist revolution in rural areas, and further infuse the invincible Mao Zedong Thought into the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members.

    打倒反对农业集体化的总后台
    海安县第一个农业社社长红灯大队民兵营三排老民兵  蒋凤银
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。”毛主席的话，真是说到我们心坎里了。合作化运动一开始，不仅地、富、反、坏分子起劲地反抗，而且混进党和政府里的资产阶级代理人，也跳出来反对和破坏。他们一个鼻孔出气，上窜下跳，到处煽阴风，点邪火，掀黑浪，泼冷水，明里暗里干了许多坏事。现在已经十分清楚了，所有这些坏人坏事的总祸根、总后台，就是中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派。
    一九六二年，正当我们广大民兵和社员在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗指引下，精神抖擞地踏过银桥走金桥，集体生产步步高的时候，党内另一个最大的走资派却大叫大嚷什么“只要能增产，单干也可以，不管白猫黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫。”他还闭着眼睛嚼舌根，胡说：“农民对集体经济丧失了信心。”这是明摆着的破坏农业集体化，污蔑集体经济不能增产，叫我们搞单干，走回头路，吃二遍苦，真是黑肠黑肺黑心肝！我们一千个不听，一万个不干！
    敌人越是起劲地反对人民公社，破坏集体经济，挖社会主义墙脚，我们就越是要把人民公社办好，把集体经济搞好，把社会主义墙脚打得牢牢的，以此来粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋。
    我们按照毛主席关于“人民公社好”的教导，发扬“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的革命精神，把集体经济搞得一天比一天旺，把人民公社办得一年比一年好。我们大队依靠人民公社的集体力量，兴修水利，造了北凌大水闸，办了电灌站，买了手扶拖拉机。真是：河边有个电灌机，场头有个脱粒机，墙上有个广播机，社员乐得笑嘻嘻！人民公社一大二公，人多力量大，热气高，干劲足，抗拒自然灾害不在话下。象今年夏、秋两季，正当庄稼生长的关键时刻，百日不雨，连续高温，土地龟裂，禾苗卷叶、发黄。广大群众不畏旱魔，“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战……的作风”，电灌送、机器打、挖井抽、水车踏、粪桶挑、水瓢舀，“三车六桶”全出动，男女老少齐上阵。经过连续四次抗旱斗争，使发了黄、卷了叶的庄稼又重新伸枝展叶，绿油油地茁长了！最后，终于逼令天公献出了金黄的玉米和雪白的棉花，在大旱年成夺得了大丰收，粮棉双高产。
    一场稀有的严重干旱被广大革命群众征服了，这表现了人民公社一大二公的优越性。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果！
    回想一九三二年，这里六十天不雨，灾后的情景是：地干三尺，遍地盐霜，庄稼枯死，颗粒无收，卖儿卖女，四处逃荒，白骨丢他乡！想想过去，比比今朝，怎能不叫我们从心坎里大声歌唱：
        单干独木随风摇，
        集体能抗大风暴；
        人民公社是金桥，
        全亏毛主席好领导！
    历史把党内另一个最大的走资派推上了受审台。所有这些活生生的事实给了他一记响亮的耳光！他大念“白猫”“黑猫”经，咒骂集体经济，企图搞垮人民公社，那是痴心妄想！我们遵照毛主席“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”的教导，奋起毛泽东思想铁扫帚，把党内另一个最大的走资派，连同他的“不管白猫黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫”的反动谬论，统统扫进垃圾堆，肥麦沤田！
    编者的话
    党内另一个最大的走资派散布“不管白猫黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫”的反动谬论，就是为了颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。江苏海安县角斜“红旗民兵团”的民兵和社员们，以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争为纲，以毛泽东思想为武器，根据他们亲身的体会，从各个方面揭露了这种谬论的反动本质，戳穿了党内另一个最大的走资派散布这种谬论的险恶用心。他们这样进行革命大批判，好得很。
    当前农村无产阶级文化大革命的重大任务之一，就是进一步开展革命的大批判。通过革命的大批判，把中国最大的走资派所宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“桃园经验”等等反动谬论，以及他们进行复辟资本主义的各种反革命罪行，揭深，批臭，并结合本单位的斗、批、改，肃清其流毒。在革命大批判中，必须进一步学习伟大领袖毛主席关于农村社会主义革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，进一步把百战百胜的毛泽东思想灌输到贫下中农和广大社员群众中去。
