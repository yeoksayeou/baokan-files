The Red Cross Society of China has cabled the Red Cross Society of Albania to express condolences to the people in the earthquake-stricken areas of Albania.

A cable of condolences says: We have learned with shock that a severe earthquake has occurred in your country, causing casualties and damage. As our great leader Chairman Mao has said, "Though living far apart, we are as close as neighbors." The hearts of the Chinese people are with you, despite the vast distances between our two countries. Please convey our deep sympathy and heartfelt condolences to the people in the disaster-stricken areas. We are confident that, under the leadership and care of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor, you will be able to quickly overcome the effects of the disaster.
