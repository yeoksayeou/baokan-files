The first Chinese medical team that came to serve the people of Somalia has completed two years and four months of work and left Mogadishu by plane on November 23 to return home.

On the morning of their departure, Somali Republic President Sharmarke received the entire team and the members of the second Chinese medical team who came to replace them. Also present at the reception were the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Somalia, Zheng Peitang.

President Sharmarke highly praised the work of the Chinese medical personnel in Somalia. He said, "The work and activities of the Chinese doctors in Somalia have greatly strengthened the friendly relations between the governments and peoples of Somalia and China. I have personally seen the Chinese medical personnel serving the Somali people day and night. The Somali people cannot find the right words to express their gratitude to the Chinese doctors. They are very satisfied with the work of the Chinese doctors. On behalf of the Somali government and people, I express my heartfelt thanks to the Chinese doctors." President Sharmarke also wished the second Chinese medical team success in their future work.

On the evening of November 21, Somali Minister of State for Affairs Muhammad Sheikh Yusuf Darbi held a banquet to see off the first Chinese medical team and welcome the second Chinese medical team.

The work of the Chinese medical personnel in Somalia has won the great trust and praise of the Somali people. The broad masses of the Somali people call them "good doctors sent by Chairman Mao" and "White-seeking doctors." After the news of the Chinese doctors' departure spread, people flocked to persuade them to stay. They expressed their gratitude to the Chinese medical personnel in the most touching words, and many people repeatedly asked the Chinese doctors to convey their greetings to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, after their return home.
