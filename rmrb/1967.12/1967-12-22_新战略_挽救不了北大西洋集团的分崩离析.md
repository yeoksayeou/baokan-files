The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) held a ministerial council meeting in Brussels, where after two days of discussion, they hastily concluded by adjusting the political and military strategies of the organization.

Due to the development of the revolutionary struggles of the world's people, the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, the further weakening of American imperialism, and the tightening of U.S.-Soviet collusion, NATO is increasingly disintegrating and fragmenting. The aggressive bloc that the United States has painstakingly built is facing the danger of complete collapse.

In order to keep this mess of NATO going, the United States used this meeting to "revise" the political and military strategies of the organization. The meeting's "report" openly declared that due to the "peaceful coexistence" principle of the Soviet Union, which has changed the nature of its confrontation with the West, the political tasks of this organization have taken on new dimensions. The meeting also decided to change the strategy of "massive retaliation" to "flexible response." This so-called new strategy, in essence, is to use U.S.-Soviet collusion as the center to reconcile the contradictions within the imperialist camp, so that the United States can continue to control Western Europe and continue to use NATO as a tool for its global counter-revolutionary strategy. However, this "new strategy" cannot change the situation where the United States and Western European countries are sleeping in the same bed but dreaming differently, nor can it ease the struggle between the United States and Western European countries, especially between the United States and France, for hegemony in Europe; instead, it will have the opposite effect.

France did not participate in the discussion of the military strategy of the so-called "Defense Planning Committee," and before the meeting, the Chief of the General Staff, Ayrault, published an article opposing military "dependence on the United States." At the ministerial council, France also vigorously opposed the United States on the Vietnam issue. The chaos of NATO and the predicament of the United States have never been as prominent as in this meeting.

On the issue of tightening collusion with the Soviet revisionist clique and conducting peaceful infiltration into the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, the United States and Western European countries are in agreement but have their own plans. The meeting's "report" on the one hand emphasizes that "pursuing détente and easing tensions must not split the alliance," on the other hand, it has to stipulate that "each ally, as a sovereign state, its own policies do not have to follow the collective decisions." This indicates that the struggle between the United States and Western European countries for hegemony in Europe will continue to develop.

The "new strategy" adopted at this meeting is actually to further revive the militaristic forces of West Germany, making West Germany the military pillar of NATO. At the instigation of the United States, the militaristic forces of West Germany openly proposed the so-called "defense policy" that West German troops must be equipped with nuclear weapons before the meeting. The United States is obviously trying to let West Germany get involved in nuclear weapons, making West Germany a key player in Europe, competing with France. This will inevitably make the contradictions between the United States and France more acute, further deepening the split within NATO.

The "report" of this meeting also emphasizes that NATO cannot "isolate itself from crises and conflicts in external regions." This is actually to make Western European countries follow the United States in opposing China and suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, serving the global counter-revolutionary strategy of the United States. However, Western European countries have stated that they only agree to "consultations" and do not undertake obligations. These countries need to use the power of the United States to deal with the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but they do not want to be the ones to get burned.

It is clear that the so-called new strategy formulated by American imperialism through this meeting is merely a hodgepodge of various contradictions within the organization. It reflects the increasingly fierce struggle among the imperialist countries, which are in their death throes, to seize the world market, spheres of influence, and hegemony in the face of the excellent global revolutionary situation.

The counter-revolutionary new strategy of NATO is a product of the comprehensive collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist clique has long advocated "easing tensions in Europe" and establishing a "European collective security system." American imperialism has taken up this slogan from the Soviet revisionist clique, formulated the so-called new strategy of NATO, and advocated for mutual disarmament between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to assist the treacherous acts of the Soviet revisionist clique. The Soviet revisionist clique, of course, understands this well. It not only does not oppose NATO's blatant infiltration into the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries but also complains that the United States is not doing enough, accusing the United States of "obstructing the expansion of East-West relations." This vividly depicts the ugly face of these traitors who are eager to completely surrender to American imperialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will always make a desperate struggle." No matter what kind of "new strategy" American imperialism adopts, it cannot save NATO from disintegrating. The struggles of the world's revolutionary people will ultimately send American imperialism and the aggressive military blocs it has organized to the grave.

    “新战略”挽救不了北大西洋集团的分崩离析
    本报评论员
    北大西洋侵略集团在布鲁塞尔举行的部长理事会会议，经过两天的讨论，调整了这个集团的所谓政治和军事战略以后，草草收场了。
    由于世界人民革命斗争的发展，资本主义总危机的加深，美帝国主义力量的进一步削弱，以及美苏勾结的加紧，北大西洋集团日益分崩离析，四分五裂。美帝国主义苦心经营的这个侵略集团，面临着彻底垮台的危险。
    美国为了使北大西洋集团这个烂摊子得以继续维持下去，通过这次会议“修改”了这个集团的政治和军事战略。会议的“报告”公开宣称：由于“苏联的‘和平共处’原则已使它同西方的对抗的性质发生改变”，这个集团的“政治任务出现了新的范畴”。会议并且决定把“大规模报复”战略改为“灵活反应”战略。这个所谓新战略，拆穿来说，就是以美苏勾结为中心，来调和帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾，以便美国继续控制西欧，并且继续把北大西洋集团作为它推行反革命全球战略的一个工具。但是，这个“新战略”丝毫不能改变美国同西欧国家同床异梦的局面，也不能缓和美国同西欧国家之间，特别是美法之间争夺欧洲霸权的斗争，而只会适得其反。
    法国没有参加讨论军事战略的所谓“防务计划委员会”，并且在会议前夕由国防总参谋长阿耶雷发表文章，反对军事上“依附于美国”。在部长理事会上，法国又竭力在越南问题上将美国的军。北大西洋集团的混乱和美国处境的狼狈，从来没有象这次会议表现得这样突出。
    在加紧同苏修集团勾结以及向苏联和东欧国家进行和平渗透的问题上，美国和西欧国家是一致而又各有打算的。这次会议的“报告”一方面强调“追求和缓紧张局势决不准许分裂联盟”，另一方面又不得不规定，“各个盟国作为主权国家，它们各自的政策不必服从集体的决定”。这就表明，美国同西欧国家争夺欧洲霸权的斗争，必将继续发展。
    这次会议通过的“新战略”，实际上是要进一步复活西德军国主义势力，把西德作为北大西洋集团的军事支柱。在美国的怂恿下，西德军国主义势力公然在会议前夕提出西德军队必须装备核武器的所谓“防务政策”。美国显然是要让西德染指核武器，使西德在欧洲居于举足轻重的地位，同法国分庭抗礼。这就势必使美法矛盾更加尖锐化，从而加深北大西洋集团的分裂。
    这次会议的“报告”还强调，北大西洋集团不能同“外界地区发生的危机和冲突”“孤立开来”。这实际上就是要西欧国家跟着美国反对中国和镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争，为美国的反革命全球战略效劳。可是，西欧国家却声明它们只同意“进行磋商”，“而不承担义务”。这些国家既需要利用美国的力量来对付亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放运动，而又不愿意为美国火中取栗。
    十分明显，美帝国主义通过这次会议制定的所谓新战略，不过是罗列了这个集团各种矛盾的一个大杂烩。它反映了在大好的世界革命形势下，垂死挣扎的帝国主义国家之间争夺世界市场、势力范围和霸权的势不两立的斗争，越来越激烈了。
    北大西洋集团的反革命新战略，是美苏全面勾结的产物。苏修叛徒集团早就提出了“缓和欧洲局势”，建立“欧洲集体安全体系”的主张。美帝国主义接过了苏修集团的这个口号，制定了北大西洋集团的所谓新战略，并且鼓吹北大西洋集团和华沙条约组织相互裁军，来策应苏修集团的叛卖勾当。苏修集团对此当然是心领神会的。它不但不反对北大西洋集团明目张胆地向苏联和东欧国家加紧进行渗透，反而嫌美国做得还不够放手，埋怨美国“阻挠东西方关系的扩大”。这就活活刻划出了这伙大叛徒急于向美帝国主义彻底投降的丑恶嘴脸。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”美帝国主义不管采取什么样的“新战略”，都挽救不了北大西洋集团的分崩离析。世界革命人民的斗争，终将把美帝国主义同它所组织的侵略性军事集团统统送进坟墓。
