Stationed on the desolate Kunlun Mountains, how does one strictly carry out Chairman Mao's directive to support the left?

Loyal Hearts Follow Chairman Mao: Letter After Letter Sent to Loved Ones

Lan Kongxin

In the northwestern frontier of our motherland, atop the towering Kunlun Mountains, stands the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. Surrounding this area for hundreds of miles, there is not a single soul, not even birds can be seen. Once the heavy snow sets in, communication with the outside world is cut off for four to five months.

Though mountains and rivers separate us, our hearts are united with Beijing. The Fourth Company listens to the Central People's Broadcasting Station every day, following Chairman Mao's instructions to the letter; as soon as Chairman Mao gives an order, everyone springs into action immediately.

Chairman Mao instructed: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." The Fourth Company's area has no civilians, so how can they support the left? The soldiers thought long and hard. Chairman Mao's instructions must be carried out without any compromise. If people cannot go down the mountain, letters can. Thus, the Fourth Company immediately launched a campaign to support the left through writing letters. Letter after letter, filled with ardent support for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, flew over countless mountains and rivers to various parts of the country, stirring up a resounding echo. Soldier Wang Pinda's father initially did not understand the Cultural Revolution and did not want his children to join the Red Guards. However, after receiving a letter from his son on the Kunlun Mountains, who spoke at length about the great significance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the wolfish ambitions of China's Khrushchev, the old man reflected on past hardships and his heart opened. Not only did he actively support his children in joining the Red Guards, but he himself also joined the ranks of the revolutionary forces.

The article "Patriotism or Treachery?" was published, and the Fourth Company understood this as an order from Chairman Mao's headquarters to directly attack the bourgeois headquarters. The entire company immediately took action. In one denunciation meeting after another, the soldiers and officers angrily denounced the clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Radio operator Kuang Yintang contracted high-altitude ear inflammation, losing his hearing. However, he still participated in the revolutionary criticism meetings, vehemently refuting the fallacies of the power-holders. He said, "My ears may be deaf, but I still have a mouth to speak and hands to write letters. I will follow the great leader Chairman Mao closely and make revolution."

Now, as 1967 comes to an end, the soldiers of the Fourth Company on the Kunlun Mountains are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, welcoming the arrival of the new year. They look towards Beijing, wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life, and expressing their determination to make new contributions in the new year, following Chairman Mao's wise teachings, in the struggle to defend the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    驻守在荒无人烟的昆仑山上，怎样不折不扣地执行毛主席的支左号令？
    红心紧跟毛主席　封封家书寄亲人
    兰空新
    在祖国西北边疆，高耸入云的昆仑山上，驻守着人民解放军某部四连。这里，周围几百里没有人烟，甚至飞鸟也绝迹，一到大雪封山，四五个月与山下隔断联系。
    隔山隔水不隔心，颗颗红心向北京。四连天天收听中央人民广播电台的广播，听毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么干；毛主席一声令下，大家就立刻行动。
    毛主席指示：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”。四连驻地周围没有人民群众，怎么支左呢？战士们想了又想，执行毛主席的指示不能打折扣，人不能下山，信可以下山。于是，四连立即开展了写家信支左活动。一封封热情支持无产阶级革命派的书信，越过千山万水，飞到祖国各地，激起了响亮的回声。战士王品达的父亲，最初对文化大革命不理解，不愿意子女参加红卫兵，但当他接到来自昆仑山上儿子的来信，向他大讲特讲毛主席革命路线的伟大意义，大讲特讲中国赫鲁晓夫的狼子野心后，老人忆苦思甜，心开了窍，不仅积极支持子女参加红卫兵，自己也投身到革命派的行列。
    《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》一文发表了，四连听出这是毛主席的司令部发出的直捣资产阶级司令部的号令，全连立刻行动。在一次又一次的声讨会上，指战员愤怒声讨党内最大的一小撮走资派。无线电员匡映堂得了高山中耳炎，听觉失灵。但他同样参加了革命大批判会，怒斥走资派的谬论。他说：“我耳朵聋了，但还有口能说，还有手能写信，我要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席闹革命。”
    现在，一九六七年即将过去，昆仑山上四连的指战员们满怀革命豪情迎接新的一年的来临。他们遥望北京，祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，表示要在新的一年里，遵照毛主席的英明教导，在保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中，作出新的贡献。
