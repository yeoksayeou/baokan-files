The three principles of the 8341 Unit of the People's Liberation Army in supporting the left are as follows:

1. **Propagate Mao Zedong Thought extensively, and do thorough, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work.** Do not rush to take a stand. Conduct investigations and research. If both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, gradually unite them.

2. **Learn from the workers, do not be afraid of making mistakes, and correct them if wrong.** Care for the people's livelihood.

　　人民解放军八三四一部队支左工作的三项原则
　　大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作。不匆匆忙忙急于表态，经过调查研究，如果两派都是革命的群众组织，就逐步地把他们联合起来。
　　向工人群众学习，不怕犯错误，错了就改。关心群众的生活。
