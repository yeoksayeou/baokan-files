Edition: 4

On December 3, 1967, our great leader Chairman Mao received representatives from the first meeting of the Navy’s active learners of Chairman Mao’s works. Shuxijicheng, a representative from the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” and a combat hero, tightly grasped Chairman Mao’s hand and said with great emotion, “I represent all the officers and soldiers of the regiment in greeting you, wishing you eternal life!” This was the tenth time Chairman Mao had received representatives from the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment.” Each time, Chairman Mao’s reception gave them the greatest care, the greatest education, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest motivation.

Under the warm care and guidance of Chairman Mao, the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” has, over the past decade, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with an unyielding spirit and a heroic demeanor, daring to fight and dare to win, daring to engage in close combat in the skies. They have fought the enemy to pieces in the high skies and sunk the enemy to the bottom of the sea in ultra-low altitudes. Whether it was the so-called “air king” fighter jets of American imperialism or the high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, boasted as the “Western strategic eyes,” they were all defeated. They have successively shot down and damaged several dozen enemy aircraft of ten different types, invincible and dominating the seas and skies!

“Navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.” The “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” has fought its way through the skies with the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the result of firmly adhering to Chairman Mao’s military line and resolutely fighting against the bourgeois military line. Comrade Lin Biao has repeatedly praised them as a unit that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and is firm in political work.

Firmly adhering to Chairman Mao’s teachings, building the military from a political standpoint

Comrade Lin Biao said, the basic spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong’s military thought is that the construction of the people’s army should emphasize politics and first and foremost build the military from a political standpoint. The “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” is a technically complex aviation unit. Since its establishment, it has firmly adhered to building the military from a political standpoint and resisted the bourgeois military line advocated by Peng Dehuai’s agent, Liu Shaoqi. In 1960, after the expanded meeting of the Military Commission, chaired by Comrade Lin Biao, issued the “Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army,” their direction became clearer, and their resolve became stronger. They firmly defended Chairman Mao’s military line and engaged in a head-on struggle with Liu Shaoqi’s agent, Luo Ruiqing.

Special forces are technically demanding, so what should be prioritized in training pilots? This is a question the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” often encounters. Once, the regiment received a batch of new pilots. Some people, using the excuse that the unit was special and technically demanding, proposed to first lay the technical foundation and “prioritize flight training,” with political education to be conducted in spare time. They said, “Flight units rely on technology to take off. New pilots, upon arrival, should concentrate on political education, which does not understand the characteristics of aviation units.” This remark caught the attention of the regiment’s Party committee. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao’s teaching, “Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the entire party to engage in great political struggles,” and realized that this was not just a simple matter of time arrangement but a major issue of whether military work or political work should come first and which line to follow in building the military. The Party committee mobilized the masses to hold a great debate around this issue. Everyone used their personal experiences to criticize this wrong understanding. During the Korean War, the regiment, by adhering to Chairman Mao’s principle of political construction, focused on political education, laid a solid political foundation, and raised the pilots’ consciousness. Although the pilots had only flown a few dozen hours on average, they dared to engage with American air pirates who had flown a thousand or two thousand hours and had superior equipment, and achieved the victory of shooting down and damaging sixteen enemy aircraft. Pilot Wang Kun, with only three years of primary school education, average technical skills, and vision problems, was initially considered to have his flight qualifications revoked. However, the regiment’s Party committee believed that Wang Kun, with his deep hatred and love for Chairman Mao, would definitely become an excellent pilot, and firmly opposed his elimination. As a result, Wang Kun shot down and damaged one enemy aircraft each in his first battle in Korea and later continued to shoot down and damage three more enemy aircraft, becoming a flag of heroic air combat in the unit. Everyone said: The unit is special, but politics cannot be special. The stronger the technical demands, the more Mao Zedong Thought education should be strengthened. Through this debate, the regiment strengthened the Mao Zedong Thought education for new pilots, quickly turning this batch of pilots into a new force for the unit.

Just as the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” was firmly implementing the Four Firsts and carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, some people, using the excuse of unit changes, changing tasks, changing situations, and complex environments, proposed to concentrate on technical training. They said, “Politics can be emphasized in peacetime, but now military work should be emphasized, and ‘Daily Reading’ should not be conducted in a stable manner.” The Party committee immediately realized that this was a fallacy of alternating emphasis between military and political work. They organized the unit to repeatedly study the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the expanded meeting of the Military Commission, engage in great debates, talk about the sweetness of adhering to the Four Firsts, and discuss the bitterness of emphasizing military work. Everyone drew profound lessons from the past experiences of the First Battalion in executing two re-equipment tasks. Once, they executed the re-equipment training task for the same type of aircraft, thinking to quickly re-equip the unit. Although the technology was not complex, due to the lack of emphasis on politics, the result was that the faster they wanted to go, the slower they actually went, taking more than half a year for this re-equipment training. Another time, they went out to execute the re-equipment training for different types of aircraft. Although the technology was complex and the region was new, they learned from the previous lesson, emphasized politics, carried problems to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, and insisted on “Daily Reading.” As a result, they completed the re-equipment task in five months. Everyone’s understanding was raised, resisting some people’s wrong practices. In this emergency re-equipment training for different types of aircraft, they insisted on “Daily Reading,” conducted “mini-rectification,” and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide the re-equipment training. As a result, they completed the task in just two months. Everyone said, emphasizing politics cannot be divided by time or place. Political work should be effective one hundred percent of the time. Changing situations, emphasizing politics can never change. The more complex the environment, the more Mao Zedong Thought should be relied upon.

The “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” firmly adheres to emphasizing politics and studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, creating a great situation. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing, using the excuse of war preparedness and busy work, publicly criticized them for “excessive politics, reduced combat effectiveness, and affected war preparedness.” The officers and soldiers of the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” resolutely defeated the arrogant attacks of the bourgeois military line, defended Chairman Mao’s military line, and refuted the falsehood of “excessive politics, reduced combat effectiveness, and affected war preparedness.” At this time, they went out to fight a battle. In the tense battle preparations, they still insisted on emphasizing politics, first concentrating on studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds. As a result, shortly after arriving in the combat area, they achieved their first victory. Wang Hongxi shot down an invading American-made Chiang Kai-shek RF-101 aircraft, giving Luo Ruiqing a resounding slap in the face! Comrades said, war preparedness is important, but emphasizing politics is even more important. Work is busy, but first, we must grasp Mao Zedong Thought. Flight altitude is limited, but the power of Mao Zedong Thought is limitless.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “The correct political and military lines are not naturally and peacefully produced and developed but are produced and developed through struggle.” The “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” is precisely in the struggle to smash the bourgeois military line, placing political work in the foremost position of all work, firmly adhering to studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, and firmly establishing Chairman Mao’s military line.

Firmly adhering to Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, forging their own path

The “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” uses Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, smashes the old regulations, old systems, and foreign dogmas and rigid frameworks of the bourgeois military line, and firmly follows the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “The foundation of the army lies in the soldiers. Without the progressive political spirit permeating the army and without progressive political work to carry out this permeation, ... it is impossible to arouse the maximum war enthusiasm of officers and soldiers, and all technology and tactics cannot be based on the best foundation to play their due roles.” However, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, from the training outlines and flight orders smuggled by the Soviet revisionists, are a stubborn “fortress,” seriously obstructing the implementation of emphasizing politics. These outlines, orders, and regulations are over a million words long. For many years, the officers and soldiers of the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment,” following Chairman Mao’s teachings, have been firmly struggling against these foreign regulations and rigid frameworks. These regulations stipulate that “during flight days, no activities unrelated to flight are allowed.” Once entering the four stages of a flight day, political education is not allowed, and on-site propaganda and mobilization work is not allowed. They would rather sit and wait for the weather than conduct political education. In fact, they turned flight days into a “no-go zone” for political work. The Party committee started from mobilizing the masses to analyze the causes of problems in flight and raised everyone’s awareness. The entire regiment conducted a comprehensive investigation of all big and small problems in flight training and specifically analyzed them in conjunction with the situation at that time. The cause of each problem was a charge of pure military viewpoint, all of which were living teaching materials for emphasizing politics. A series of facts clearly showed: Whenever the political work of a flight day was done well, the quality of flight training was high; whenever the political work of a flight day was not done well, accidents and accident precursors were more frequent. Comrades said, flying with a pure military viewpoint, one does not know for whom to fly, the more one flies, the softer the wings, and the more problems arise; using Mao Zedong Thought to guide flight, one’s mind is clear, the direction is clear, the more one flies, the harder the wings, and the more red the thoughts. Through multiple analyses and discussions, repeated practices, they finally broke through this “no-go zone,” placing the study of Chairman Mao’s works and political and ideological work in the commanding position of flight days.

Since the Cultural Revolution, the Party committee, from Chairman Mao’s teaching, “The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue,” realized that to thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeois military line, smash these unreasonable foreign regulations and rigid frameworks, a thorough reform and thorough revolution were necessary. They mobilized the officers and soldiers to deeply expose and accuse the crimes of foreign regulations and rigid frameworks. Comrades said, foreign regulations and rigid frameworks forcibly stipulated that each pilot must fly hundreds of practices, but many of them are just for show and are not useful in battle. Some even restricted our hands and feet in combat. These foreign regulations and rigid frameworks seriously obstructed us from emphasizing politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to command technology, and fully playing the role of human factors. This great criticism smashed the foreign regulations and rigid frameworks in thought.

The Party committee, following Chairman Mao’s teaching of “learning war from war,” guided everyone to adhere to the principle of combining revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude, mobilized the masses, and first seriously summarized the unit’s practical experience over the years, proposing several thousand rationalization suggestions for reforming training. Under the guidance of higher authorities and the assistance of brother units, they only took a few months to rewrite a set of flight orders and training outlines guided by Mao Zedong Thought. They changed hundreds of flight practices into dozens of practices, with each practice guided by Chairman Mao’s instructions, using Chairman Mao’s quotations as command language. They turned the entire process of flight training into a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works. They fully carried forward the glorious tradition of the three great democracies and mutual teaching between officers and soldiers in our army, greatly improving the training quality and greatly shortening the training time. Past courses that took several years to complete are now completed in less than a year. Pilots said, “Self-written outlines, self-flown, angering the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists. Flying with Mao Zedong Thought, the direction is clear in the clouds and fog.”

Firmly adhering to building a unit that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao

The Party committee of the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” deeply felt that there is a struggle between two lines in educating and cultivating the broad officers and soldiers. To win this battle and thoroughly smash the reactionary military line of the bourgeoisie, the most fundamental thing is to carry out a thorough ideological revolution among the people, using the boundless Mao Zedong Thought to command every action and guide every action, building the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” into a unit that is forever infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao.

From the establishment of the aviation unit, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing have been shouting that the flight unit is “special,” concocting a so-called “fourteen-point material life care for pilots,” and even forbidding pilots to go to the countryside for labor training, attempting to isolate the unit from the masses. The “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment,” following Chairman Mao’s teachings of never leaving the masses and serving the people wholeheartedly, firmly resisted and struggled against this revisionist “fourteen-point.” They extensively studied and applied Chairman Mao’s works, further regulating that air and ground personnel take turns going to the countryside to participate in labor every month and going to the countryside for political camping every year, and canceling those special regulations. They treated the countryside as a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, laboring with poor and lower-middle peasants, studying the “Three Constantly Read Articles,” eating “bitter meals,” talking about sweet memories, learning the noble qualities of poor and lower-middle peasants, and making pilots forever maintain the fine tradition of hard struggle and never forget their roots. In this way, the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” achieved one victory after another in the battle of ideological revolution, making the officers and soldiers into proletarian warriors who cannot be blown down by sweet winds or hit by candy bullets, always maintaining the character of the working people.

The “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” has always attached great importance to revolutionary heroism education in the unit. But when Battalion Commander Gao Xiang, with the revolutionary spirit of bayonets meeting red, shot down the American air pirate F-104, Luo Ruiqing blurted out, “Now preserving oneself is the first priority, and you are not allowed to be so reckless again!” The revolutionary leading cadres of the Navy who adhere to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line immediately gave a stern refutation to Luo Ruiqing’s fallacious talk of living philosophy and said to Comrade Gao Xiang, “You fought well, you did the right thing, don’t listen to his nonsense!” Chairman Mao teaches us, “Destroying the enemy is the main task, preserving oneself is the second priority.” We must listen to Chairman Mao’s words and fear no sacrifice for the revolution. The Party committee further clarified: To cultivate a unit loyal to Chairman Mao is to cultivate brave soldiers who dare to face hardships and sacrifices for the revolution. With this spirit, one can achieve Chairman Mao’s command to fight wherever he points, daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire to defend Chairman Mao. They further summarized the experience of cultivating the unit’s spirit of daring to sacrifice for the revolution, taking “dying for the people is dying with a sense of fulfillment” as the action guideline, and calling on the officers and soldiers to learn from Lei Feng, Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, Wang Kun, Shu Jicheng, Wang Hongxi, and Gao Xiang. Under the education and inspiration of revolutionary heroism, the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” produced heroes one after another, with everyone volunteering for heavy tasks and daring to climb high peaks. There appeared more than 140 heroic models such as Ma Qingsheng and Liang Sheng, who sacrificed themselves to save the aircraft, Zhang Bingxian and Wang Xiangyi, who explored the high sky, and Hu Chunsheng, who bravely fought the enemy with his eardrums burst in the stratosphere. They proudly said, “The martyrs’ hot blood was shed on the land of China, what do we, the later generations, seek? Following Chairman Mao’s path, what is there to fear in sacrificing our heads for the revolution!”

From the day of its establishment, the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” has, following Chairman Mao’s teachings, undertaken the task of supporting world revolution, having the glorious tradition of fighting for world revolution. American imperialism burned the war of invading Vietnam to the Gulf of Tonkin, and the broad officers and soldiers were indignant, volunteering to support the Vietnamese people’s anti-American patriotic struggle. The Party committee, through reading newspapers, giving situation reports, holding picture exhibitions, and organizing accusation meetings, placed the heinous crimes of American imperialism in slaughtering the people of the world vividly in front of each comrade, making everyone vividly feel the sufferings of the people of the world and hear their calls for liberation. Using the method of “two thoughts and two looks,” they inspired everyone to think about the yesterday of our country’s people, look at the today of the oppressed people of the world; look at the today of our country’s people, think about the tomorrow of the people of the world. They required the officers and soldiers to always have two maps: one in the hand with the flight map and one in the mind with the world revolution map. This made the officers and soldiers more firmly establish the thought of fighting for world revolution, with everyone’s fighting spirit soaring and daring to fight bravely. In the battle to defend the sacred airspace of the motherland, in less than half a year, they achieved the great victory of shooting down and damaging four American bandit aircraft, again achieving new merits for the people and world revolution. Zhang Chengli wrote in his diary with boundless passion, “Buried in the soil, why must it be the homeland? The five continents and four seas are my home. I am willing to shed all my hot blood and swear to make the world red!”

Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the “Sea and Sky Eagles Regiment” became more courageous and stronger in the sharp struggle between the two lines. Long-term struggle practice made them deeply realize: To achieve victory in the sharp and complex struggle, one must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they closely followed Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment and the latest instructions, vigilantly defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They were like eagles ready to take off, and as soon as Chairman Mao gave the order, they would take to the skies and charge forward. Chairman Mao instructed, “The People’s Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses,” and they immediately dispatched a large number of officers and soldiers to the front lines of “three supports and two militaries”; as soon as the “Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural Areas of the Country” was issued, they immediately mobilized the entire regiment to go deep into the countryside, quickly transmitting Chairman Mao’s voice to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants; Chairman Mao called for fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, and they quickly launched a wave of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. They are determined to closely follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, forever following the course indicated by Chairman Mao, spreading their wings high, until the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is planted all over the world.

　　靠毛泽东思想威镇海空
　　——记坚决贯彻毛主席建军路线的海军“海空雄鹰团”
    一九六七年十二月三日，我们伟大领袖毛主席在接见海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表时，“海空雄鹰团”的代表、战斗英雄舒积成紧紧握住毛主席的手万分激动地说：“我代表全团指战员向您老人家问好，祝您老人家万寿无疆！”这是毛主席第十一次接见“海空雄鹰团”的代表。毛主席的每次接见，都给他们以最大的关怀、最大的教育、最大的鼓舞、最大的鞭策。
    “海空雄鹰团”在毛主席的亲切关怀和教导下，十多年来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以一往无前、压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，敢打敢拚，敢于空中刺刀见红。在高空打得敌人粉身碎骨，在紧贴海面的超低空打得敌人葬身海底。无论是美帝国主义号称“空中霸王”的战斗机，还是被吹嘘为“西方战略眼睛”的高空侦察机，都统统被打得落花流水。他们先后击落击伤十一种类型的敌机几十架，所向披靡，威镇海空！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。“海空雄鹰团”在空中杀出的威风，是坚持毛主席建军路线，同资产阶级军事路线坚决斗争的结果。林副主席曾多次表扬他们是一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在突出政治上过得硬的部队。
    坚定不移地遵照毛主席的教导，从政治上建军
    林副主席说，毛泽东同志的建军思想的基本精神，就是人民军队的建设要突出政治，要首先着重地从政治上建军。“海空雄鹰团”是技术复杂的航空兵，建团以来就坚定不移地从政治上建军，对中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人彭德怀推行的资产阶级军事路线进行了抵制。一九六○年，林副主席亲自主持的军委扩大会议作出了“关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议”后，他们方向更明，决心更大，坚决捍卫了毛主席的建军路线，同中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人罗瑞卿进行了针锋相对的斗争。
    特种兵技术性强，培养飞行员应该先抓什么？这是“海空雄鹰团”经常碰到的一个问题。一次，团里接受了一批新飞行员，有的人借口兵种特殊，技术性强，提出先打技术基础，“优先安排飞行”，政治教育只能插空进行。说什么“飞行部队是靠技术上天，新飞行员一来就集中时间搞政治教育，是不懂航空兵特点”。这话引起了团党委的重视。他们反复学习了毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，认识到这不只是一个简单的时间安排问题，而是军事第一还是政治第一，按照什么路线建军的大问题。团党委发动群众，围绕这个问题展开了一场大辩论。大家用自己的亲身体会，批判了这种错误认识。抗美援朝时，这个团由于坚持了毛主席的政治建军原则，抓紧了政治教育，政治基础打得好，飞行员觉悟高，虽然飞行员平均只飞了几十小时，就敢于同装备上占优势的，飞过一、二千小时的美国空中强盗交锋，并且取得了击落击伤十六架敌机的胜利。飞行员王昆，只有初小三年的文化程度，技术一般，两眼视角又有毛病，当时有人要取消他的飞行资格。但团党委认为，王昆苦大仇深，学习毛主席著作好，无限热爱毛主席，一定能够成为一个很好的飞行员，坚决不同意把他淘汰。结果，王昆在入朝作战的第一次战斗中，就击落击伤敌机各一架，后来又连续击落击伤敌机三架，成为部队空中英勇战斗的一面旗帜。大家说：兵种特殊，政治上不能特殊，技术性强，毛泽东思想教育更要加强。通过这场辩论，加强了新飞行员的毛泽东思想教育，使这批飞行员迅速成为部队的一支生力军。
    正当“海空雄鹰团”坚决贯彻四个第一，开展活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的时候，又有人借口部队要改装训练，任务变了，情况变了，环境也复杂了，要集中时间抓技术。说什么：“平时可以突出政治，现在要突出军事，不能再四平八稳搞‘天天读’”。团党委立即警觉到：这是一种军事、政治轮流突出的谬论。他们又组织部队反复学习古田会议决议和军委扩大会议决议，大争大辩，大谈坚持四个第一的甜头，大摆突出军事的苦头。大家从一大队过去两次执行改装任务的情况中，得到了深刻的启示。一次是执行同机种的改装训练任务，心想把部队很快改装出来，虽然技术并不复杂，但由于没有很好地突出政治，结果欲速则不达，使这次改装训练花了半年多时间。另一次是外出执行不同类型机种改装训练，虽然技术复杂，地区新，但他们接受了上次的教训，突出了政治，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，坚持了“天天读”，结果五个月完成了改装任务。大家提高了认识，抵制了某些人的错误作法，在这次不同机种的紧急改装训练中，坚持“天天读”，进行“小整风”，用毛泽东思想指导改装训练，结果只用了两个月就完成了任务。大家说，突出政治不能分时间、地点，政治工作要在百分之百的时间里起作用。情况变化，突出政治永远不能变，环境越复杂，越要靠毛泽东思想作指导。
    “海空雄鹰团”坚持突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作蔚然成风，一派大好形势。然而，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿借口战备紧张，工作忙，公开指责他们“政治搞多了，战斗力下降了，影响战备”。“海空雄鹰团”指战员坚决打垮资产阶级军事路线的猖狂攻击，保卫毛主席的建军路线，纷纷怒斥“政治搞多了”的滥调，用活生生的事实戳穿了“战斗力下降了，影响战备”的谎言。就在这时，他们外出作战，在紧张的战斗准备中仍然坚持突出政治，首先集中时间活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，结果，到达作战地区不久，就首战告捷，王鸿喜一举歼灭入侵的美制蒋机RF—101一架，给了罗瑞卿一记响亮的耳光！同志们说，战备紧，突出政治更要紧。工作忙，首先是掌握毛泽东思想。飞行高度有限，毛泽东思想威力无限。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。”“海空雄鹰团”正是在大破资产阶级军事路线的斗争中，把政治工作摆在一切工作的首位，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，大立毛主席建军路线。
    坚定不移地以毛泽东思想为指针，闯自己的路
    “海空雄鹰团”以毛泽东思想为指针，大破资产阶级军事路线的旧规章、旧制度和洋教条、死框框，坚定不移地走毛主席指引的道路。
    毛主席教导我们：“军队的基础在士兵，没有进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中，没有进步的政治工作去执行这种贯注，……就不能激发官兵最大限度的抗战热忱，一切技术和战术就不能得着最好的基础去发挥它们应有的效力。”然而，彭德怀、罗瑞卿从苏修贩卖过来的大部大部的训练大纲和飞行教令，是个顽固的“堡垒”，严重地阻碍着突出政治的落实。这些大纲、教令、操典，洋洋百万余言。多年以来，“海空雄鹰团”的指战员遵照毛主席的教导，同这些洋条条、死框框进行了坚决的斗争。这些条例规定，“在飞行日里不得做与飞行无关的事”，一进入飞行日的四个阶段，就不准安排“天天读”，不准搞现场宣传鼓动工作，宁愿坐着等天气，也不准进行政治教育。实际上把飞行日变成了政治工作的“禁区”。团党委从发动群众分析飞行中问题的原因入手，来提高大家的认识。全团同志对飞行训练中的大小问题，来了一个全面清查，并联系当时的情况背景进行了具体的分析。每次发生问题的原因，都是一条单纯军事观点的罪状，都是必须突出政治的活教材。一系列事实清楚地表明：凡是那个飞行日的政治工作做好了，飞行训练的质量就高；凡是那个飞行日的政治工作没有做好，事故和事故苗头就多。同志们说，带着单纯军事观点飞行，就不知为谁而飞，越飞翅膀越软，越飞问题越多；用毛泽东思想指导飞行，就心里亮堂方向明，越飞翅膀越硬，越飞思想越红。通过多次分析讨论，反复实践，终于冲破了这个“禁区”，把学习毛主席著作、政治思想工作，摆到了飞行日的统帅地位。
    文化大革命以来，团党委从毛主席“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”的教导中认识到，要彻底肃清资产阶级军事路线的影响，砸烂这些不合理的洋条条、死框框，必须彻底改革，彻底革命。他们发动指战员深入揭发和控诉洋条条、死框框的罪行。同志们说，洋条条、死框框强行规定我们每个飞行员要飞好几百个练习，其实有的尽是花架子，打仗用不上，有的在作战中还束缚了我们的手脚。这些洋条条、死框框，严重地阻碍我们突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅技术，充分发挥人的因素。这次大批判把洋条条、死框框，从思想上砸碎了。
    团党委遵循毛主席“从战争学习战争”的教导，引导大家本着革命精神和科学态度相结合的原则，发动群众，首先认真总结了部队多年来的实践经验，对改革训练提出了几千条合理化建议。在上级的指导和兄弟部队的协助下，仅仅花了几个月时间，就重新编写出了一套以毛泽东思想为指针的飞行教令和训练大纲。把几百个飞行练习改成了几十个练习，每一个练习都用毛主席指示作指导思想，把毛主席语录作为指挥用语。把飞行训练的全过程变成了活学活用毛主席著作的过程。充分发扬了我军三大民主、官兵互教的光荣传统，训练质量大大提高，训练时间大大缩短，过去几年飞不完的课目，现在不到一年就飞完了。飞行员说：“自编大纲自己飞，气死苏修和美帝。带着毛泽东思想去飞行，云里雾里方向明。”
    坚定不移地建设一支永远忠于毛主席的部队
    “海空雄鹰团”党委深深体会到，用什么样的思想去教育和培养广大指战员，存在着两条路线的斗争。要在这场战斗中取胜，彻底摧毁资产阶级反动军事路线，最根本的根本，就是大搞人的思想革命化，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想指挥每个行动，统帅每个行动，把“海空雄鹰团”建设成为一支永远无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的部队。
    从航空兵开始建立起，彭德怀、罗瑞卿就叫嚷飞行部队“特殊”，炮制了一个所谓“飞行员物质生活照顾十四条”，还禁止飞行员到农村劳动锻炼，妄图把部队与人民群众隔绝起来。“海空雄鹰团”遵照毛主席一刻也不脱离群众，全心全意为人民服务的教导，对这个修正主义的“十四条”进行了坚决的抵制和斗争。他们大学大用毛主席著作，在开展忆苦教育的基础上，进一步规定空地勤人员每月轮流到农村参加劳动，每年到农村政治野营，并取消了那些特殊化的规定。他们把农村当做活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，与贫下中农同劳动，同学“老三篇”，同吃“忆苦饭”，谈甜思源，学习贫下中农的高贵品质，使飞行员永远发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，永不忘本。就这样，“海空雄鹰团”在思想革命化的战斗中，取得了一个又一个重大胜利，使指战员成为香风刮不倒，糖弹打不中，始终保持着劳动人民本色的无产阶级战士。
      “海空雄鹰团”历来重视部队的革命英雄主义教育。但当大队长高翔以刺刀见红的革命精神，打下美帝空中强盗F—104时，罗瑞卿却胡说什么：“现在保存自己是第一位的，以后不许你再这样蛮干了！”坚持毛主席革命路线的海军革命领导干部，对罗瑞卿这种活命哲学的滥调，当即给予了严厉驳斥，并对高翔同志说：你们打得好，你们作得对，不要听他那一套！毛主席教导我们“消灭敌人是主要的，保存自己是第二位的。”我们就是要听毛主席的话，为革命不怕牺牲。团党委更加明确了：要培养忠于毛主席的部队，就是要培养为革命不畏艰险、不怕牺牲的坚强战士。有了这种精神，才能做到毛主席指到那里打到那里，为保卫毛主席刀山敢上、火海敢闯。他们进一步总结了培养部队勇于为革命献身精神的经验，把“为人民而死，就是死得其所”作为行动准则，号召指战员学习雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊，学习王昆、舒积成、王鸿喜、高翔。在革命英雄主义的教育和鼓舞下，“海空雄鹰团”英雄辈出，人人争担重任，个个敢攀险峰。出现了舍身救机的马青生、梁沏，高空探险的张炳贤、王相一，在同温层压破耳膜仍勇猛歼敌的胡春生等英雄模范一百四十多名。他们豪迈地说：“先烈热血洒神州，我等后辈有何求？沿着毛主席的道路走，为革命何惧抛我头！”
      “海空雄鹰团”从建立的第一天起，就遵照毛主席的教导，担负起支援世界革命的战斗任务，有着为世界革命而战的光荣传统。美帝国主义把侵略越南的战火烧到北部湾，广大指战员义愤填膺，纷纷要求支援越南人民反美爱国斗争。团党委通过读报、作形势报告、举办图片展览、开控诉会等方法，把美帝国主义屠杀世界人民的累累罪行，活生生地摆在每个同志的面前，让大家形象地感受到世界人民的苦难，倾听出他们要求解放的呼声。用“两想两看”的方法，启发大家想一想我国人民的昨天，看一看世界被压迫人民的今天；看一看我国人民的今天，想一想世界人民的明天。要求指战员经常要有两张图：手里拿着飞行图，脑子里装着世界革命图。使指战员更加牢固地树立了为世界革命而战的思想，人人斗志昂扬，个个英勇杀敌。在保卫祖国神圣领空的作战中，不到半年时间，他们就取得了击落击伤美国强盗飞机四架的重大胜利，为人民、为世界革命又立新功。张成理同志在日记中豪情满怀地写道：“埋骨何须故土，五洲四海为家，愿将热血洒尽，誓叫全球赤化！”
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，“海空雄鹰团”在两条路线的尖锐斗争中，愈战愈勇，愈战愈强。长期的斗争实践使他们深深体会到：要在尖锐复杂的斗争中取得胜利，必须无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧跟毛主席的最新指示，警惕地保卫无产阶级文化大革命。他们犹如待命出击的战鹰，只要毛主席一声令下，就腾空而起，勇往直前。毛主席指示“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”，他们就立即派出大批指战员，奔赴“三支”“两军”前线；《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》刚发布，他们马上全团总动员，深入农村，把毛主席的声音迅速传给广大贫下中农；毛主席号召要斗私，批修，他们闻风而动，迅速掀起了斗私批修热潮。他们决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，永远沿着毛主席指引的航向，展翅高飞，直到把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全球。
