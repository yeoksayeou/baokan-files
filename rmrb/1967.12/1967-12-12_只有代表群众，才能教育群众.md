After Chairman Mao issued his great call to resume classes and make revolution, the students in Class 3, Section 1 of the Political Education Department at our university swiftly took action. They decided to take "Chairman Mao's Theory on the Continuation of the Revolution Under Proletarian Dictatorship" as their topic, prepared their own lectures, and successfully completed the first lesson—the introductory course. As teachers, we listened to the students' lectures and gained much inspiration and education.

In the introductory course, the students, filled with revolutionary fervor, emphasized that the fundamental task of studying "Chairman Mao's Theory on the Continuation of the Revolution Under Proletarian Dictorship" is to firmly establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. They also, with intense class hatred, exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and a few bourgeois academic "authorities" within the school who attacked the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. The students truly transformed the university's political courses into a battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and criticizing revisionism.

In the past, under the rule of China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and a few bourgeois academic "authorities" in our Political Education Department advocated that political courses should have "scientificity" and "systematicity," which meant they did not want a firm and correct political direction for the proletariat, did not want the revolutionization of people's thinking, and did not want the Three-Eight Style and the Four Firsts. They attempted to lead young students and young teachers down the capitalist road. Now, the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the school have seized power, reclaiming the ground long occupied by them. The Red Guards have taken to the podium, truly boosting the morale of the revolutionary proletariat and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

The teaching methods of the introductory course were also lively and engaging. After the students gave their lectures, everyone debated the content of the lecture. Although there were some shortcomings in the lecture, everyone agreed that the direction was correct. In short, the classroom has become a "forum for the masses" rather than the teacher's "one-man show" in the past, fully embodying the mass line teaching method of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers." This is an innovation in abolishing the old bourgeois teaching order and establishing a new teaching order of mutual teaching and learning between teachers and students.

In the past, when the old bourgeois teaching order ruled the school, only teachers were allowed to criticize students, and students were not allowed to criticize teachers. If students criticized teachers, they were considered to be "disrespecting the teacher's labor" and "not maintaining the teacher's authority," and so on. In fact, this was the reactionary public opinion created by the capitalist roaders to maintain the rule of bourgeois intellectuals in our school.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only by representing the masses can one educate the masses; only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses." The Red Guards' lecture was successful mainly because they have an unlimited love, loyalty, admiration, and faith in the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. They can humbly listen to different opinions, so they can take on the task of educating the masses and being teachers of the masses.

On the contrary, those bourgeois "authorities" stand on the reactionary bourgeois position, regarding themselves as nobles above the "common people." Such people, "no matter how great their talents, are not needed by the masses, and their work has no future."

This is the inspiration and education we gained after listening to the Red Guards' lecture on the podium. (Accompanying photo)

During the resumption of classes and making revolution, revolutionary teachers and students in the Third Central Primary School in Zhabei District, Shanghai, jointly carried out various forms of revolutionary criticism activities. This is the students of Class 1 of the graduating class in 1967, writing big-character posters to criticize the poisoning of the revisionist educational line after holding a meeting to criticize and denounce it.

　　只有代表群众，才能教育群众
　　北京师范大学革命教师
    毛主席关于复课闹革命的伟大号召发出以后，我校政教系三年级一班的同学闻风而动。他们确定以《毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论》为课题，自己准备，自己讲课，并且已经胜利地完成课目的头一节——导言课。作为教师，我们听了同学们的讲课，得到了许多启发和教育。
    在导言课里，同学们满怀着革命的激情，大讲特讲学习《毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论》的根本任务，是大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。他们又带着强烈的阶级仇恨，揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和学校内的少数资产阶级反动学术“权威”攻击伟大领袖毛主席和伟大毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。同学们把大学的政治课真正改变成为宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，成为批判修正主义的战场。
    过去，在中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的统治下，我校政教系的党内一小撮走资派和少数资产阶级反动学术“权威”，鼓吹政治课要讲什么“科学性、系统性”，就是不要无产阶级的坚定正确的政治方向，不要人的思想革命化，不要三八作风、四个第一。他们企图把青年学生和青年教师引向资产阶级的道路。现在，学校中广大革命的学生、革命的教员、革命的工人掌握了学校的大权，夺回长期被他们霸占的阵地，红卫兵小将登上讲台，真是大长无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭资产阶级的威风。
    导言课的教学方法也是生动活泼的。同学讲课以后，大家针对他讲课的内容，展开了辩论。虽然觉得讲课还有一些不足之处，但是，大家共同的意见是方向对。总之，课堂已变成了“群言堂”，而不是过去教师的“一言堂”，充分体现了“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的群众路线的教学方法。这是废除过去资产阶级旧教学秩序，建立师生互教互学新教学秩序的创举。
    过去，资产阶级旧教学秩序统治学校的时候，只许教师批评学生，不准学生批评教师。如果学生批评教师，就被认为是“不尊重教师的劳动”，“不维护教师的威信”，等等。其实，这正是走资派为了维持资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校所制造的反动舆论。
    毛主席教导我们说：“只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。”红卫兵小将的课讲得好，根本的一条是因为他们对伟大的领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想怀有无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限崇拜、无限信仰的阶级感情，是因为他们能够虚心地听取不同意见，所以就能够担当起教育群众的任务，做群众的先生。
    相反，那些资产阶级“权威”，他们站在反动的资产阶级立场上，把自己看作高踞于“下等人”头上的贵族，这样的人，“不管他们有多大的才能，也是群众所不需要的，他们的工作是没有前途的。”
    这就是我们听了红卫兵小将登台讲课后，所得到的启发和教育。（附图片）
