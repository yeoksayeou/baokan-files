The revolutionary workers of the Jiangmen Sugar Refinery in Guangdong have taken "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as their guiding principle, focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production. In November, at the start of the new crushing season, they completed the state's sugar production plan by 33 percent.

This largest sugar refinery in South China had historically had to reprocess the sugar produced at the beginning of the new crushing season. However, this year, the sugar produced at the start of the new crushing season met the state's quality standards, breaking the old rule of having to discard and reprocess the initial batch.

    江门甘蔗化工厂蔗糖大增产
    广东江门甘蔗化工厂的革命职工，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓革命，猛促生产，在新榨季开始的十一月份，就超额百分之三十三完成了国家蔗糖生产计划。
    这个华南最大的制糖厂，在历年新榨季开头制出的新糖，都要返工重炼。而今年新榨季一开头炼出的新糖，就达到了国家规定的质量标准，打破了历年来开头要报废重炼的老规矩。　　　（据新华社讯）
