The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Dongxing Production Brigade, Sanxing People's Commune, Yilan County, Heilongjiang Province, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Since early October, they have been holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively, achieving immediate results. The main features of the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Dongxing Brigade are as follows:

1. All members participate in the study; all are students of the study class. Since early October, both the brigade and the production teams have established study classes. The brigade's study class includes production team cadres, representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, militia cadres, and activists who study Chairman Mao's works. This has cultivated a core group for establishing study classes in various production teams. The production teams' study classes, with the exception of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, include all members and cadres. Within the production teams, small groups are formed based on households, with each group consisting of three to five households. Each group is led by brigade and team cadres and core militia members, with small group activities as the main focus, interspersed with family meetings, small group meetings, and full-team meetings. Members generally feel that "this method is good; men, women, old, and young, even those with children, can all participate."

2. The study classes are guided by the principle of "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie," holding multiple sessions to focus on solving one central issue per session. This winter and next spring, efforts will be concentrated on launching a few campaigns to thoroughly criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeoisie.

The brigade initially plans to hold three study class sessions this winter and next spring. The first session focuses on understanding the situation of the Cultural Revolution and partially addresses the relationship between cadres and the masses. The first session has concluded. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, receiving great inspiration and encouragement, their fighting spirit is even more ardent, their self-awareness in criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie has increased, and they eagerly expose their private thoughts and criticize them. Through criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie, the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer, and their determination to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end has grown stronger. The second session, in conjunction with the year-end distribution of benefits, thoroughly exposes the cover of the struggle between the two lines and two roads in the distribution of benefits, criticizes and cleanses the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by China's Khrushchev in rural benefit distribution, and correctly handles the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual according to Chairman Mao's teachings, making this year's benefit distribution exhibit a new socialist style. This session is currently underway. After completing the second session, a new year will begin. Currently, members are discussing, "How will the revolution be carried out next year? How will production be done?" They say, "To achieve new victories next year, we must first sharpen our ideological sword before preparing for the spring plowing." Therefore, the third session of the study class is planned to start by thoroughly exposing the cover of the struggle between the two lines and two roads in rural production and construction, solving the issue of cadres and members farming for the revolution and scientifically farming.

After completing these three sessions, the brigade plans to establish a permanent part-time school for studying Chairman Mao's works, ensuring that the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie is sustained.

3. The study classes are held part-time, with no specific time requirements, focusing on solving problems thoroughly.

Whether the brigade or the production teams hold study classes, participants do not leave their original work positions. They work during the day and attend study classes in the evening; they eat and sleep at home, with the classroom in the team, unrestricted by production activities and without the need for rotation. The duration of each session is determined by the thoroughness of solving the problem. The first session held by the brigade took ten evenings, while the production teams took a bit longer, about forty days. The second and third sessions are expected to take about a month each, roughly ending before the Spring Festival.

4. The basic content of the study is Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," combining situation education, class education, and revolutionary struggle history education.

Throughout the study process, Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles" are used as weapons to criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeoisie. First, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, facts are presented, and the situation of the Cultural Revolution is analyzed to conduct extensive situation education. Over a year of Cultural Revolution, whether cadres or the masses have deep feelings, but there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the situation of the Cultural Revolution. Presenting facts and analyzing them with Mao Zedong Thought is the easiest and most effective method. The more cadres and the masses present facts, the more they feel that victory is truly "the greatest, greatest, greatest," and losses are truly "the smallest, smallest, smallest." Discussing achievements, finding roots, they love Chairman Mao even more, love Chairman Mao's revolutionary line even more, and are more determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Many revolutionary cadres, seeing the great situation, feel that suffering a few "bumps and bruises" in the mass movement is trivial, "touching the soul is a good thing, losing is defects and errors, gaining is anti-revisionist weapons, and anti-revisionist immunity."

Next, extensive old and new society comparisons are made, recalling family and village histories to conduct bitter-sweet education, arousing deep class feelings among revolutionary masses and cadres; combined with old and new society comparisons, revolutionary struggle history education is conducted, making everyone more aware of how hard-won the proletarian revolutionary power is, arousing the spirit of revolutionary forerunners' hard work, self-sacrifice, wholeheartedly for the revolution, and bravery in self-sacrifice. The deeper this education goes, the more it arouses the broad revolutionary masses and cadres' love for the new society, their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and their hatred for China's Khrushchev.

5. Combining struggle, criticism, and transformation, thoroughly criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie. Criticizing the self primarily involves criticizing the self in the struggle between the two lines and two roads. Exposing the self relies on self-awareness, with cadres taking the lead. Based on exposing the self, combing the hair, digging up the roots, finding the harm, and conducting thorough criticism. Through criticizing the self, digging up revisionist roots, cadres and members recognize that "self" is the black goods peddled by China's Khrushchev, the core of exploitative class thought, and the root of revisionism. In criticizing the self and digging up revisionist roots, combined with cleansing the poison, further criticizing China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "three autonomies and one contract" and other counter-revolutionary fallacies, the revolutionary criticism is deepened further.

How to transform the countryside? The fundamental issue is to do a good job in struggle and criticism. Once struggle and criticism are done well, transformation becomes easier. Transformation starts with changing thoughts. With a change in thoughts, a series of changes in production management, distribution systems, and other aspects become easier to implement. This brigade, with a spirit of daring to practice, is preparing to further thoroughly expose the cover of the struggle between the two lines and two roads in production construction, labor management, and technical management, further cleansing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev in rural areas, and reforming the unreasonable superstructure.

　　怎样在农村举办毛泽东思想学习班？
　　——黑龙江省依安县东兴大队毛泽东思想学习班情况调查
    依安县三兴公社东兴大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，从十月初起大办毛泽东思想学习班，收到立竿见影的效果。东兴大队办毛泽东思想学习班的主要特点是：
    一、所有社员都参加学习，都是学习班学员。十月初以来，大队和各生产队都办起了学习班。大队的学习班，有生产队干部、革命群众组织代表、民兵干部、学习毛主席著作积极分子参加，为各生产队办学习班培养了一批骨干。各生产队的学习班，除地、富、反、坏、右分子外，所有社员、干部都参加，在生产队下面划分小组，东西屋、一个院、三五户一个组。每个组都以大、小队干部和基干民兵为骨干。以小组活动为主，家庭会、小组会、全队会穿插进行。社员普遍反映：“这个办法好，男女老少、拖儿带女的也都能参加。”
    二、学习班以“斗私，批修”为纲，连续办几期，每期解决一个中心问题，在今冬明春集中力量打几个战役，真正把私字斗臭，把修正主义批透。
    这个大队初步计划在今冬明春办三期学习班。第一期学习班集中解决对于文化大革命形势的认识问题，同时解决一下干部和群众的关系问题。第一期已经结束。广大贫下中农和革命干部学习了毛主席的最新指示，受到巨大的鼓舞和鞭策，斗志更加昂扬，斗私批修的自觉性更加提高，纷纷争先恐后地亮私心、斗私心。干部和群众通过斗私批修，关系更密切，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心更大了。第二期学习班结合年终收益分配工作，狠揭分配问题上两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，彻底批判和肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在农村收益分配上散布的反革命修正主义流毒，按照毛主席的教导，正确处理国家、集体和个人三者关系，使今年的收益分配出现一个社会主义的新风格。这一期学习班正在进行。办完第二期，新的一年即将开始，现在社员已在议论“明年革命怎么搞？生产怎么干？”他们说：“为取得明年的新胜利，备耕前就得先磨好思想这把刀。”为此，第三期学习班准备从大揭农村生产建设上两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子入手，解决干部、社员为革命种田和科学种田的问题。
    办完这三期学习班，这个大队还准备办常年学习毛主席著作的业余学校，使活学活用毛主席著作和斗私批修的群众运动持久地坚持下去。
    三、业余办，时间不做具体规定，以问题解决深透为准。
    无论大队还是生产队办学习班，参加学习的人都不脱离原生产岗位，白天搞生产，晚间上学习班；食宿在家里，课堂在队里，不受生产活动的限制，也不必轮流上学。每期的学习时间，以把问题解决深透为准。第一期大队办的学习班用了十个晚上，生产队办的时间更长一些，共搞了四十天左右。第二期、第三期预计各搞一个月左右，大体要到春节前结束。
    四、以毛主席最新指示和“老五篇”为基本的学习内容，形势教育、阶级教育、革命斗争史教育相结合。
    整个学习过程，都是以毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”为武器来斗私批修。首先是以毛主席的最新指示为武器，通过摆事实，分析文化大革命形势，大搞形势教育。一年多的文化大革命，无论干部还是群众感受都很深，但是，对文化大革命形势缺乏全面的了解。大摆事实，用毛泽东思想进行分析，是最容易办，也是最易见效的方法。干部和群众越摆，就越觉得胜利真是“最大最大最大”，损失真是“最小最小最小”。谈成绩，找根源，更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛主席的革命路线，更加坚定了把文化大革命进行到底的决心。许多革命干部看清了大好形势，就感到自己在群众运动中受点“磕磕碰碰”是微不足道的，“触触灵魂是大好事，失去的是缺点错误，得到的是反修的武器，防修的免疫力。”
    其次是，大搞新旧社会对比，通过忆家史、村史进行忆苦思甜教育，激发起革命群众和干部深厚的阶级感情；结合新旧社会对比，进行革命斗争史的教育，大家就更体会到无产阶级革命政权来之不易，激发起学习革命先辈艰苦奋斗，前赴后继，全心全意为革命，勇于自我牺牲的精神。这个教育搞得越深入，就越激发起广大革命群众、革命干部对新社会的热爱，对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫就越仇恨。
    五、斗批改结合，大破大立。斗私，主要是斗两条道路、两条路线斗争中的私。亮私靠自觉，干部首先带头。在亮私的基础上，梳辫子，挖根源，找危害，深刻地进行批判。经过斗私心，挖修根，使干部、社员认识到“私”字是中国赫鲁晓夫贩卖的黑货，是剥削阶级思想的核心，是产生修正主义的祸根。在斗私心、挖修根中，结合肃清流毒，进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”等反革命谬论，把革命大批判又引深了一步。
    农村里如何改？根本问题是搞好斗批。斗批搞好了，改就好办了。改，首先是从思想上改。有了思想上的改，一系列的生产管理、分配制度等方面的改就好进行了。这个大队正以勇于实践的精神，准备进一步大揭生产建设、劳动管理、技术管理等方面两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，进一步肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在农村方面的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，改革不合理的上层建筑。
