“Don’t mind me,
“Don’t mind me, saving the Red Guards is the priority!”

This was the final words of comrade Li Wenzhong, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, as he fought to save the Red Guards. It was a moment of great brilliance, shining with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. It fully embodies the noble qualities of the proletarian hero Li Wenzhong.

“Don’t mind me!” These four radiant words fully demonstrate that comrade Li Wenzhong truly embodied the spirit of “selflessness,” “serving the people wholeheartedly,” and “having no selfish motives” as taught by Chairman Mao in his “Three Articles.” It inspires every comrade to follow Chairman Mao’s instructions to “completely” and “thoroughly” serve the people, and to strive to transform our worldview.

Chairman Mao pointed out: “In terms of worldview, in modern times, there are basically only two types: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.”

If you are a true revolutionary warrior who has established a proletarian worldview, you will inevitably prioritize the interests of the proletariat, the Party, and the people, and the overall situation of the revolution. You will always say, “Don’t mind me.” If you cling to a bourgeois worldview, you will inevitably prioritize yourself in every situation, always putting “me” at the center. You will do what benefits “me” and avoid what does not. The interests of the proletariat, the Party, the people, and the overall situation of the revolution will all be disregarded.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Fighting selfishness means eliminating all selfish motives of the exploiting classes and establishing the spirit of “publicness” of the proletariat. By following Chairman Mao’s instructions, we can become noble, pure, moral individuals, free from lowly interests, and beneficial to the people.

“Don’t mind me!” This is the common oath of countless martyrs of our army, a great revolutionary tradition nurtured by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

With this “Don’t mind me,” Huang Jiguang could rush towards the enemy’s gun port, opening the path to victory for the troops. With this “Don’t mind me,” Lei Feng could dedicate his limited life to serving the people without reservation. With this “Don’t mind me,” heroes like Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang could step forward and save others at the critical moment when the lives of the masses were threatened. It is this spirit of “Don’t mind me” that makes our army unstoppable, overwhelming all enemies, and never yielding to them.

Comrade Li Wenzhong fought and died for Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. Comrade Li Wenzhong’s “Don’t mind me” fully embodies the selfless revolutionary spirit of countless advanced elements of the proletariat under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, continuing the revolution.

Comrade Li Wenzhong had no “me” in his mind, only Great Leader Chairman Mao. His guiding principle was, “If Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; if Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; if Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow; if Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance.” “Defend Chairman Mao, even if it means death.”

Comrade Li Wenzhong had no “me” in his mind, only the revolutionary masses. He had “only one heart with the masses, not two,” loving the masses more than his own life.

Today, to be a true proletarian revolutionary and a true proletarian revolutionary warrior, one must, like comrade Li Wenzhong, have only Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses in one’s heart, saying, “Don’t mind me.” If the “me” is emphasized, as the heroes of the Fourth Platoon said, “It will lead to a biased heart, biased eyes, and biased feet, deviating from Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.” Chairman Mao’s Thought and instructions would not be genuinely implemented.

The lofty spiritual state of “Don’t mind me” achieved by hero Li Wenzhong powerfully answers some confused notions in the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism.

Can the “self” not be overcome? Is the “public” unattainable? Can breaking the self and establishing the public only be done gradually? No. The bourgeois “self” is a stubborn fortress, but as long as one, like comrade Li Wenzhong, uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide all thoughts and actions in the great waves of class struggle, elevates the struggle against selfishness and the establishment of the public to the height of the struggle between the two lines, and with a revolutionary spirit of “seizing the day,” actively attacks the bourgeois “self,” thoroughly exposes it, fiercely struggles against it, and resolutely changes it, one can achieve immediate results and reach the peak of the proletarian “public.”

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches the soul and transforms the worldview. In this great struggle, we must seriously learn from comrade Li Wenzhong, often use comrade Li Wenzhong’s spirit of “Don’t mind me” and communism to examine ourselves, check ourselves, and demand of ourselves, raising the level of our ideological revolution to a new height.

### “不要管我”

    “不要管我”
    “不要管我，救红卫兵要紧！”
    这是毛主席的好战士李文忠同志在抢救红卫兵的战斗中，在生命的最后一刻，从灵魂深处发出的闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的豪言壮语。它集中地表现了无产阶级的英雄李文忠同志的共产主义的高尚品质。
      “不要管我”！这四个光彩夺目的大字充分表明，李文忠同志真正把毛主席在“老三篇”中谆谆教导我们的“毫无利己的动机”、“毫不利己专门利人”、“毫无自私自利之心”的精神，化为自己的灵魂。它激励着我们每个同志，按照毛主席指示的“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的方向，努力改造世界观。
    毛主席指出：“就世界观来说，在现代，基本上只有两家，就是无产阶级一家，资产阶级一家。”
    你是一个真正树立了无产阶级世界观的革命战士，你就必然处处以无产阶级的利益、党的利益、人民的利益为重，以革命的大局为重，处处都会“不要管我”。你是一个抱着资产阶级世界观不放的人，你就必然是一事当前，先替自己打算，处处以“我”为核心。对“我”有利的就干，对“我”不利的就不干。什么无产阶级的利益，党的利益，人民的利益，什么革命的大局，都会不放在眼里。
    伟大领袖毛主席一再指示我们，要斗私，批修。斗私，就是要去掉一切剥削阶级的自私自利之心，树立无产阶级的“公”字。按照毛主席的这个指示去做，就能够成为一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
    “不要管我”！是我军无数先烈牺牲前的共同誓言，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育下的人民军队的伟大革命传统。
    有了这个“不要管我”，黄继光就能扑向敌人的枪眼，为部队开辟了胜利前进的道路。有了这个“不要管我”，雷锋就能作到“把有限的生命，投入到无限的为人民服务之中”。有了这个“不要管我”，王杰、欧阳海、刘英俊、蔡永祥等英雄人物，就能在群众生命受到威胁的千钧一发的时刻，挺身而出，舍己救人。正是这个“不要管我”的革命精神，使我们这个军队一往无前，压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。
    李文忠同志生为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而献身。李文忠同志的“不要管我”，集中体现了无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的无数无产阶级先进分子忘我的革命精神。
    李文忠同志头脑里没有“我”字，只有伟大领袖毛主席。他的行动准则是“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”，“保卫毛主席，死了也甘心”。
    李文忠同志头脑里没有“我”字，只有广大革命群众。他“与群众只有一颗心，没有两颗心”，爱护群众胜过爱护自己的生命。
    今天，要做一个真正的无产阶级革命派，真正的无产阶级革命战士，就必须象李文忠同志那样，做到心中只有毛主席，只有广大革命群众，“不要管我”。如果让“我”字突出起来，那就象英雄四排同志所说的：“就会心偏，眼偏，脚跟偏，偏离毛主席的革命路线。”对毛泽东思想和毛主席的指示，就不可能切实贯彻执行。
    英雄李文忠同志所达到的“不要管我”的崇高精神境界，有力地回答了斗私批修中的一些糊涂观念。
    “私”字斗不掉吗？“公”字高不可攀吗？破私立公只能慢慢来吗？不。资产阶级的“私”字，虽然是个顽固堡垒，但是，只要象李文忠同志那样，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，用毛泽东思想统帅自己的全部思想和行动，把破私立公提高到两条路线斗争的高度，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，主动向资产阶级的“私”字进攻，彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改，就完全能够取得立竿见影的效果，攀上无产阶级“公”字的高峰。
    无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂、改造人们世界观的大革命。我们在这场伟大斗争的实践中，一定要认真学习李文忠同志，经常用李文忠同志的“不要管我”的共产主义精神，对照自己，检查自己，要求自己，把思想革命化提到一个新的高度。
