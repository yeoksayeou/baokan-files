The key issue in the educational revolution is: whether the people we cultivate will serve the proletariat or the bourgeoisie. If we do not solve this problem, the more books people read, the more strange and bizarre things will happen, and the greater the loss to the country. I will give just one example:

Our factory is building a new workshop. A bourgeois "expert" whose thoughts have not been reformed led a group of technicians fresh out of school. Without delving into the actual situation or conducting any investigations, they proposed a design plan. They wanted to use plastic pipes to drain acid. We workers said: using plastic pipes instead of steel pipes is an advanced idea, but you should consider the temperature of the workshop. However, they paid no heed to our opinions and insisted on proceeding with the construction. As a result, after a short time, due to the temperature, the pipes deformed, and the wastewater could not be discharged, causing water to spill everywhere in the workshop. Eventually, they had to redo the work, wasting a large amount of state funds. In contrast, the workshop needed to install an acid gas extraction fan. This acid gas is highly corrosive, suitable for plastic construction, and the temperature is also appropriate, but the designer used metal instead. After installation, the fan was quickly damaged by the acid gas.

Do these "experts," who have read so many books, not know the properties of plastic? They certainly do. But why do they make such common-sense mistakes? Fundamentally, it is because the "self" has clouded their minds. They view design and construction as a means to fame and fortune. The revisionist educational system cultivates such people and encourages ideas like "standing out" and "having technology means having everything." Some students, upon entering the workplace and receiving tasks, think first not about how to efficiently complete the state's plan, but about how to showcase their "tricks" and what others will think of them. If we do not carry out an educational revolution, these people will continue to harm the youth and the nation.

The educational revolution is a major issue concerning the cultivation of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. It is a major issue concerning the perpetuation of our proletarian ironclad rule for generations to come. We workers not only need to oversee it but also to see it through to the end. We pledge to be the steadfast backbone of revolutionary teachers and students, advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

### 工人阶级誓作教育革命坚强后盾

　　工人阶级誓作教育革命坚强后盾
    教育革命的关键问题是：培养出来的人是为无产阶级服务，还是为资产阶级服务。不解决这个问题，书念得越多，稀奇古怪的事儿越多，给国家造成的损失越大。我只讲一个例子：
    我们工厂新建一个车间，一个思想没有改造好的资产阶级“专家”带着一批刚从学校出来的技术员，既不深入实际，又不调查，就提出了设计方案，他们要用塑料管道排酸。我们工人说：用塑料管代替钢管，这种设想是先进的，但你们应用时要考虑车间的温度。可是他们根本不把我们的意见放在眼里，硬要施工。结果没有多久，终于因为温度关系，管道变形，废水排不出去，弄得满屋四处都是水，后来不得不返工，浪费了国家大量资金。和这个情况相反，车间需要安装一个抽酸气的抽风机，这种酸气腐蚀性大，适用塑料构造，温度也适宜，而设计者却用了金属的，安装没有多久，抽风机就全给酸气弄坏了。
    这些读了多年书的“专家”难道不知道塑料的特性吗？肯定他们是知道的。但为什么出这些常识性的笑话呢？从根本上说来，就是“私”字迷住了心窍。他们把设计施工看成是自己成名成家的手段，而修正主义教育制度培养的就是这种人，鼓励什么“出人头地”啦，“有技术就有一切”啦，等等。有的学生走上工作岗位，接受任务，第一件想的不是如何多快好省地完成国家计划，而是记挂着自己这一“招儿”使出来，别人该对我怎样了……。如果不进行教育革命，就会继续害青年，害国家。
    教育革命是关系到培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的大事，是关系到我们无产阶级铁打江山千秋万代永不变色的大事，我们工人阶级不仅要管，而且要管到底。我们誓作革命师生的坚强后盾，沿着毛主席指引的方向前进！
