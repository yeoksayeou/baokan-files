In the midst of the nationwide wave of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes among military and civilian personnel, the People's Daily published the important editorial "Vigorously Establish Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes." This not only further clarifies the direction for establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes but also will greatly promote the development of a revolutionary learning ethos.

The several sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes we have already held were all conducted in accordance with the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, incorporating soldiers and cadres together in the study. We deeply feel that cadres and soldiers studying together can establish the revolutionary learning ethos advocated by Chairman Mao.

In a recent study class, the soldiers' boundless love and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao deeply educated us cadres. The cadres said, "We must learn from the soldiers, love Chairman Mao boundlessly, and be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." Political Commissar Zhao Tingchen and soldier Ma Zucheng studied together. Ma Zucheng voluntarily exposed the "self" in his mind. He said, "In the past, because my brother took the wrong side in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I sympathized with him out of brotherly affection. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, I realized that this sympathy was actually because I did not firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, it was the 'self' at work." Political Commissar Zhao saw the soldier bravely exposing his selfishness and was deeply moved. After inner struggle, he also exposed his selfish thoughts in dealing with the relationship with the deputy director of the technical department. The deputy director of the technical department was very moved and also voluntarily examined his shortcomings, expressing his desire to learn from the political commissar's revolutionary spirit of serious self-criticism. Due to the soldiers and cadres mutually inspiring, helping, and learning from each other, the entire study class's self-criticism and criticism of revisionism was very lively.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we follow Chairman Mao's teachings of officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers, helping each other and raising our level together. In the study class's sharing sessions, cadres and soldiers together went on stage, connecting their thoughts with reality, and freely discussing how to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They correctly recognized the great situation of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Cadres and soldiers studying together also deepened mutual understanding and further strengthened the relationship between superiors and subordinates. Squad leader Bao Shiyuan previously thought that the medical team had little to do and had a lot of free time. This time, he was assigned to the medical team group. He lived and worked with the medical team members, seeing with his own eyes that the medical team members, in addition to studying with him during the day, also treated patients in the middle of the night and early in the morning, carrying their medicine bags to the troops for rounds. Bao Shiyuan saw this with his own eyes and remembered it in his heart. With a moved heart, he wrote a letter to the platoon, reporting the medical team members' strong revolutionary spirit, hoping that the platoon members would seriously study and promote the thought revolutionization of the platoon.

    干部战士一起斗私批修
    驻沪空军某部政治处
    在全国军民大办毛泽东思想学习班的高潮中，《人民日报》发表了《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》的重要社论，这不仅给我们进一步指明了办好毛泽东思想学习班的方向，而且对我们大兴革命好学风，将起巨大的推动作用。
    我们已经举办的几期毛泽东思想学习班，都是按照我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，吸收战士同干部一起学习的。我们深切地体会到：干部和战士一起学习，能够树立起毛主席所倡导的马列主义的革命好学风。
    在最近的一期学习班上，战士们无限热爱、无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的阶级感情，使我们干部受到极其深刻的教育。干部说，我们要好好地向战士学习，要象他们那样，无限热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。政委赵廷臣和战士马祖钦一起学习时，马祖钦主动亮出了自己头脑中的“私”字。他说，过去自己曾因哥哥在文化大革命中站错了队，自己只从兄弟感情出发，盲目同情。经过学习毛主席的最新指示，认识到这种同情，实际上是自己没有坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，是“私”字在作怪。政委看到战士亮私不怕丑，触动很大。经过思想斗争，他也亮出了自己在处理同技术处副主任关系中的私心杂念。技术处副主任听了很感动，也主动检查了自己的缺点，并表示要向政委学习那种认真作自我批评的革命精神。由于战士、干部互相启发，互相帮助，互教互学，使整个学习班的斗私、批修，非常活跃。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，我们遵循毛主席关于官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵的教导，互相帮助，共同提高。在学习班的讲用会上，干部同战士一起上讲台，联系自己的思想实际，畅谈怎样活学活用毛主席的最新指示。正确认识当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。
    干部和战士一起学习，还加深了相互之间的了解，进一步密切了上下级关系。班长鲍时元，过去一直认为卫生队的同志没有多少事，空闲多。这次学习，他恰好编在卫生队小组。他和卫生队同志朝夕相处，亲眼看到卫生队同志除了白天和自己一起学习外，中午、晚上还给病人看病。他们晚上工作到深夜，第二天一早，照样背着药包去部队巡回出诊。鲍时元看在眼里，记在心里，怀着激动的心情，把卫生队同志旺盛的革命干劲，写信告诉连队，希望连队同志认真学习，促进连队的思想革命化。
