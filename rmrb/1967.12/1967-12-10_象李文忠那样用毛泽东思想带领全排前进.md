Li Wen Zhong is my closest comrade-in-arms and the best platoon leader. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he wholeheartedly and "completely" and "thoroughly" supported the leftists' revolutionary spirit, setting a good example for the entire army and the people of the nation.

Platoon Leader Li has always been clear-cut and firm in his stance while carrying out the task of supporting the leftists. In July of this year, we moved into the spinning and dyeing workshop of the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing Factory to resolutely support the actions of the leftist revolutionary masses. At this time, the capitalist roaders in the factory manipulated the conservative forces in an attempt to sabotage military-civilian unity. Platoon Leader Li immediately and resolutely declared, "We support the leftists with only one heart: even if it means climbing the knife mountain or entering the fire sea, our resolve to support the leftists will not waver!" He organized us to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "It is not a matter of the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind. On the question of the line, there is no room for compromise." He helped us strengthen our awareness and will to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Platoon Leader Li not only firmly supported the broad leftist masses but also cared for and cherished revolutionary cadres. One day, he led us out to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. After completing the task, he remembered that Jiangpu Town, about twenty li away, had complex class struggles, and a revolutionary cadre had been labeled a "counter-revolutionary" by class enemies. He then said to us, "Chairman Mao teaches us that serving the people must be 'complete' and 'thorough.' Protecting revolutionary cadres is our duty!" Without hesitation, despite the heat and hunger, he led us to Jiangpu Town, found that revolutionary cadre, and studied Chairman Mao's works with him. With boundless enthusiasm, he encouraged him to overcome selfish thoughts and firmly follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution. That revolutionary cadre was so moved that he shed tears of joy and vowed: "I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words and devote my life to the revolution!"

Platoon Leader Li's boundless love and deep affection for the leftists are indescribable. I am determined, along with all the comrades in the platoon, to learn from Platoon Leader Li's spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" supporting the leftists. We will carry on the unfinished mission of Platoon Leader Li. Like him, we will say: "Chairman Mao loves me, and I love him; Chairman Mao supports me, and I support him; Chairman Mao instructs me, and I will obey; Chairman Mao waves his hand, and I will advance." Like him, we will say: "Defend Chairman Mao, even if it means dying!" Like him, we will study Chairman Mao's works diligently in class struggles, fight against selfish thoughts, and thoroughly transform our worldview, forging a red heart that is "completely" and "thoroughly" dedicated to serving the people. Like him, we will lead the platoon with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely and unconditionally execute every battle command from Chairman Mao. In carrying out the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, we will continuously create new merits for the people and add new glory to the "model platoon for supporting the leftists and loving the people"!

    象李文忠那样用毛泽东思想带领全排前进
    现任“支左爱民模范排”排长　庞朝胜
    李文忠同志是我最亲密的战友，最好的排长。他在无产阶级文化大革命中，一心一意、“完全”“彻底”支持左派的革命精神，为全军和全国人民做出了好榜样。
    李排长在执行支左任务中从来是旗帜鲜明，立场坚定。今年七月，我们进驻江西棉纺织印染厂一准备车间，坚决支持左派革命群众的行动。这时，厂内走资派操纵保守势力妄图破坏军民团结。李排长当场斩钉截铁地说：“我们支持左派只有一颗心，就是上刀山，下火海，也动摇不了我们支持左派的决心！”他组织我们学习毛主席的教导：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”帮助我们增强了捍卫毛主席革命路线的自觉性和斗争意志。
    李排长不仅坚决支持左派广大群众，而且非常关心、爱护革命干部。有一天，他带我们外出宣传毛主席的最新指示。任务完成后，他想起离这里二十来里远的蒋巷镇，阶级斗争比较复杂，有位革命干部被阶级敌人打成了“反革命”，便对我们说：“毛主席教导我们为人民服务要‘完全’‘彻底’。保护革命干部，是我们应尽的责任！”说罢，顾不得天热，肚子饿，带领我们一气赶到蒋巷镇，找到那位革命干部，同他一起学习毛主席著作，满腔热情地鼓励他，斗倒私心杂念，坚定地跟毛主席闹革命。那位革命干部感动得流着热泪表示：坚决听毛主席的话，干一辈子革命！
    李排长一颗红心为左派，无限深情爱左派的事迹，千言万语说不尽。我决心和全排同志一起，学习李排长“完全”“彻底”为左派的革命精神，担起李排长未完成的事业。象他那样：“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”象他那样：“保卫毛主席，死了也甘心！”象他那样在阶级斗争中，刻苦学习毛主席著作，狠斗私心杂念，彻底改造世界观，“铸一颗‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务的红心”，接好毛泽东思想的班。象他那样用毛泽东思想带领全排，坚决地不折不扣地执行毛主席每一项战斗命令，在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，不断为人民立新功，为“支左爱民模范排”增添新的光辉！
