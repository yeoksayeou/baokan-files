The Japanese Gear Playhouse Troupe, carrying with them the boundless concern of the great leader Chairman Mao for the revolutionary people of Japan and the great friendship of the Chinese people, returned to Japan aboard the Chinese ship "Red Flag" at 10 a.m. on November 30.

When the members of the Gear Playhouse Troupe, carrying a portrait of Chairman Mao and waving red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," stepped onto the dock at the port of Mozi, more than a hundred people from Yamaguchi Prefecture and Kitakyushu City braved the cold wind to welcome them. They shouted in unison: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the Sato government!" "Down with the Ryoemon revisionist clique!"

Representatives from the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left), Vice Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters Yoshida Hosei, Chairman of the Gear Playhouse Troupe's Support Committee for their visit to China Otsunaka Masaharu, and the leader of the Gear Playhouse Troupe Fujikawa Natsuko spoke at the welcome ceremony held at the dock.

Guya Shoichiro, representing the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left), said in his speech: "The greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong, received the entire troupe during their visit to China. This is not only an honor for the Gear Playhouse Troupe but also an honor for the people of Yamaguchi Prefecture and all the people of Japan. Chairman Mao's reception is the greatest support and encouragement for the revolutionary people of Japan and the Japanese revolution." Guya said that the Gear Playhouse Troupe, during the height of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, visited the base of the world revolution, conveying the boundless love and respect of the revolutionary people of Japan for the great leader Chairman Mao and the deep affection of the Chinese people. They brought back the deep concern of the great leader Chairman Mao for the people of Japan and the great spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China. At the same time, they also brought back the valuable experience of learning from the Chinese cultural warriors, Red Guards, and workers and peasants in actively studying and applying the works of Chairman Mao. Guya expressed that the people of Yamaguchi Prefecture will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, master Mao Zedong Thought, and spread Mao Zedong Thought throughout Japan.

A representative from the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, who rushed from Tokyo to Mozi Port, read a congratulatory message from the association's chairman Nakajima Takeshige at the welcome ceremony.

Fujikawa Natsuko, the leader of the Gear Playhouse Troupe, spoke passionately about the moving scene of the great leader Chairman Mao receiving the troupe members. She said: "In China, Chairman Mao received us. This is an unforgettable event in our lives. Chairman Mao's reception not only greatly encouraged Japanese cultural workers but also greatly encouraged the Japanese people who are on the front lines of the anti-American, patriotic, just struggle." She said: "Only Mao Zedong Thought is invincible, and it is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time; the Japanese people can only achieve victory by following the path indicated by Chairman Mao. China is advancing victoriously in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and socialist China will forever stand at the forefront of the world revolution, inspiring the peoples of the world. The seven hundred million people of China are the greatest backbone of the Japanese people's struggle for liberation."

    当齿轮座剧团的团员们抬着毛主席画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，精神饱满地登上门司港码头时，冒着寒风前来欢迎他们的山口县和北九州市的群众一百多人，一齐高呼：“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒佐藤政府！”“打倒宫本修正主义集团！”
