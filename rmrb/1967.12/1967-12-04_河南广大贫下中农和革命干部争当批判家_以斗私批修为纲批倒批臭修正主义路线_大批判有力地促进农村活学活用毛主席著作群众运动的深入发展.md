The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Henan Province have formed a vast revolutionary army to launch an unprecedented large-scale exposure and criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in rural areas. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have expressed their determination to take "criticize self, criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, to carry the rural cultural revolution of the proletariat through to the end, and to let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the land of Zhongzhou.

At present, the revolutionary criticism in Henan's rural areas has developed into a magnificent "people's war," with the masses truly mobilized. Whether in mountainous areas or plains, from villages to fields, from dining halls to homes, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, with everyone denouncing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents through speech and writing. Many production teams and brigades have criticism columns where not only young and middle-aged people post big-character posters criticizing revisionism, but also children around ten years old and elderly people in their sixties and seventies write critical articles. These articles are clear in their hatred and love, hitting the nail on the head and striking at the heart of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The revolutionary criticism movement in Henan's rural areas is generally conducted by production teams. Various places have adopted diverse and lively forms, combining large-scale criticism meetings with small-scale criticism sessions in fields, dining halls, and homes. Many regions have launched "three remembrances, three comparisons, three criticisms" activities, which involve remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary lie of "exploitation is meritorious"; remembering the bitterness of individual farming and comparing it with the sweetness of collective production to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist fallacy of "three autonomies and one contract"; and remembering the actual class struggle in rural areas and comparing it with personal experiences to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction." By using these flexible and varied forms of criticism, closely linking them with the actual situations of the regions and units, the revolutionary criticism has been effectively promoted.

The boundless Mao Zedong Thought is the "microscope" and "demon mirror" that reveals the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Henan Province, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have thoroughly criticized the black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism, greatly raising the level of criticism and the political awareness of the masses. Many regions' poor and lower-middle peasants have studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and are particularly angry about the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious" and "exploitation saves people." They say: These are the words of Huang Shiren, the tone of Liu Wencai, speaking for landlords and capitalists. The Chinese Khrushchev is the backer of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the sworn enemy of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Many regions' poor and lower-middle peasants have studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "the vast majority of peasants in the country, in order to get rid of poverty and improve their lives, to resist disasters, must unite and advance towards the socialist road to achieve the goal." They are extremely indignant about the Chinese Khrushchev's black wind of "three autonomies and one contract," attempting to dismantle the collective economy.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Henan's rural areas deeply understand that to criticize revisionism, one must criticize selfishness, and to carry the anti-revisionist struggle through to the end, one must use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate the "self" from one's mind. Various places have universally held meetings to share experiences in criticizing selfishness and revisionism, widely mobilizing the masses to expose the bitterness of "self" and uproot the roots of "revisionism." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shizhuang Brigade, Taowan Commune, Luanchuan County, in their meeting to share experiences in criticizing selfishness and revisionism, summarized the four harms of "self": once "self" appears, individual farming rises; once "self" develops, the collective is neglected; once "self" takes command, the state and collective suffer; once "self" takes root, descendants will find it hard to rise. The more they criticize selfishness, the more they hate revisionism, and the more actively they participate in the criticism movement.

The revolutionary criticism has effectively promoted the in-depth development of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in Henan's rural areas. Over the past year, Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized in Henan's rural areas, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has been deeply rooted in people's hearts. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to spend their lives reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, turning the entire province's rural areas into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    河南广大贫下中农和革命干部争当批判家
    以斗私批修为纲批倒批臭修正主义路线
    大批判有力地促进农村活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的深入发展
    据新华社郑州三日电　河南省广大贫下中农和革命干部组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向中国赫鲁晓夫在农村方面的反革命修正主义路线展开了一场规模空前的大揭发、大批判。广大贫下中农和革命干部表示，一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，把农村无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在中州大地高高飘扬，永远飘扬。
    目前，河南农村的革命大批判已经形成了一场气势磅礴的“人民战争”，广大群众真正发动起来了。不管是山区还是平原，从村内到地头，从饭场到家庭，到处都是革命大批判的战场，人人都在口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人反革命修正主义的滔天罪行。许多生产队、大队的大批判专栏里，不但有青年、壮年人写的大批判大字报，也有十来岁的娃娃和六七十岁的老人写的批判文章。这些批判文章爱憎分明，一针见血，打中了中国赫鲁晓夫的要害。
    河南农村的革命大批判运动，一般都是以生产队为单位进行的。各地采取了多种多样生动活泼的形式，大会批判与田间、饭场、家庭的小型批判相结合。许多地区开展了“三忆三比三批”活动，这就是忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜，批中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的反革命谰言；忆单干的苦，比集体生产的甜，批中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的修正主义谬论；忆农村阶级斗争的实际，比自己亲身的经历，批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。采用这些灵活多样的大批判方式，密切结合本地区、本单位的实际，有力地推动了革命大批判的深入发展。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想是洞察中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的“显微镜”和“照妖镜”。河南省广大贫下中农和革命干部以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义黑货，大大提高了大批判的水平和群众的政治觉悟。许多地区的贫下中农学习了毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，对中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”、“剥削是救人”等反动谬论特别愤怒。他们说：这是黄世仁的语言，是刘文彩的腔调，这是替地主、资本家说话。中国赫鲁晓夫是地、富、反、坏、右的总后台，是广大贫下中农的死对头。不少地区的贫下中农学习了毛主席的“全国大多数农民，为了摆脱贫困，改善生活，为了抵御灾荒，只有联合起来，向社会主义大道前进，才能达到目的”的教导，对中国赫鲁晓夫大刮“三自一包”黑风，妄图拆散集体经济的罪行，激起了无比的愤恨。
    河南农村广大贫下中农和革命干部深深认识到，批修必须斗私，要把反修斗争进行到底，就必须用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想斗掉自己头脑里的“私”字。各地普遍召开了斗私批修讲用会，广泛发动群众诉“私”字的苦，挖“修”字的根。栾川县陶湾公社石庙大队的贫下中农在斗私批修讲用会上，总结了“私”字的四大危害：私字一出现，单干就抬头；私字一发展，集体没人管；私字一挂帅，国家集体都受害；私字一扎根，子孙万代难翻身。他们越斗私，对修正主义越是痛恨，也就越加积极地投入了大批判运动。
    革命的大批判有力地促进了河南农村活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的深入发展。一年来，毛泽东思想在河南农村得到了空前的大普及，毛主席的革命路线更加深入人心。广大贫下中农决心一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，把全省农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
