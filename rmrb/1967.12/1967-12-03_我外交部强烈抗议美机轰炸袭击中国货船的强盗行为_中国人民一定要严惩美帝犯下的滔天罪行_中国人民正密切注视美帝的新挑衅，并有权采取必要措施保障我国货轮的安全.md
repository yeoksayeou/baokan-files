The Chinese people must severely punish the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people are closely watching the new provocations of U.S. imperialism and have the right to take necessary measures to ensure the safety of our cargo ships.

	BEIJING, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on Dec. 2 strongly protesting the piratical act of U.S. military aircraft bombing and attacking a Chinese cargo ship anchored at the Hong Gai port in Vietnam. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China

	December 2, 1967

	On Nov. 25, our cargo ship Hongqi 154, anchored at the Hong Gai port in Vietnam, was bombed and attacked by U.S. military aircraft, resulting in eight of our crew members being injured and the ship suffering severe damage. This is a mad provocation by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people. The Chinese government and people strongly protest against this piratical act by U.S. imperialism.

	U.S. aircraft bombing and strafing Chinese cargo ships is not the first time. In the past, our cargo ships sailing in international waters and Vietnamese territorial waters have been savagely attacked by U.S. military aircraft many times, causing heavy losses of life and property to the Chinese people. Now, U.S. imperialism has again incurred a blood debt to the Chinese people. U.S. imperialism thinks that by bombing and attacking Chinese cargo ships, it can intimidate the Chinese people, stop Chinese people from aiding the Vietnamese people, disrupt normal trade between China and Vietnam, and achieve the goal of blockading and isolating Vietnam. This is sheer fantasy. The evil plots of U.S. imperialism will never succeed.

	At present, the situation on the Vietnam battlefield is excellent. The Vietnamese people have smashed the two "dry season offensives" and continuous "war escalations" by U.S. imperialism and have launched offensives, achieving extremely brilliant results. U.S. imperialism is in a very embarrassing situation. To change this situation, U.S. imperialism is trying to expand the war. It is not only making desperate struggles in South Vietnam and intensifying bombing in the North, but it has also made new provocations against the Chinese people. This cannot but draw the close attention of the Chinese people. We must warn U.S. imperialism that the Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, are not to be intimidated. The determination of the Chinese people to aid the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is unshakable by any threats. You have committed crimes and must be punished. To ensure the safety of Chinese cargo ships, the Chinese people have the right to take all necessary measures, and the U.S. imperialism must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising therefrom.

	HANOI, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- The ruthless U.S. imperialism, disregarding the stern warnings and angry condemnations of the Chinese government, again dispatched aircraft on Nov. 25 to launch a savage attack on a Chinese cargo ship anchored at the Hong Gai port in North Vietnam, injuring many crew members and damaging the ship. This is a very serious new military provocation by U.S. imperialism against the People's Republic of China at the same time as it is seriously "escalating" its aggression in Vietnam.

	On Nov. 25, the Chinese cargo ship Hongqi 154 arrived at the Hong Gai port from Haiphong. At 7:10 p.m. that day, U.S. pirate aircraft began dive-bombing the Chinese cargo ship. Bombs exploded about ten meters away from our cargo ship on the water surface, injuring eight crew members and causing more than twenty damages to the ship. During the savage attack by U.S. pirate aircraft, all crew members of our cargo ship fought resolutely, displaying the courageous and indomitable spirit of fearlessness.

	The attack by U.S. pirate aircraft on Chinese cargo ships is not the first time. The new crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people will surely be punished as they deserve.

    我外交部强烈抗议美机轰炸袭击中国货船的强盗行为
    中国人民一定要严惩美帝犯下的滔天罪行
    中国人民正密切注视美帝的新挑衅，并有权采取必要措施保障我国货轮的安全
    新华社二日讯　中华人民共和国外交部二日发表声明，强烈抗议美国军用飞机轰炸袭击中国停泊在越南鸿基港口的货船的强盗行为。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
    一九六七年十二月二日
    十一月二十五日，我国停泊在越南鸿基港口的货船红旗一五四号，遭到美国军用飞机的轰炸袭击，致使我船员八人受伤，船身遭到严重破坏。这是美帝国主义对中国人民的一个疯狂的挑衅事件。中国政府和中国人民对于美帝国主义的这一强盗行为，表示强烈的抗议。
    美国飞机轰炸和扫射中国的货船已经不是第一次了。过去行驶在公海和越南领海的我国货轮，曾多次遭到美国军用飞机的野蛮袭击，造成了中国人民生命财产的重大损失。现在，美帝国主义又对中国人民欠下了血债。美帝国主义以为它轰炸和袭击了中国的货船，就可以吓倒中国人民，阻止中国人民对越南人民的援助，就可以破坏中越两国的正常贸易，达到封锁和孤立越南的目的。这完全是痴心妄想。美帝国主义的罪恶阴谋是永远也不能得逞的。
    当前，越南战场的形势大好。越南人民粉碎了美帝国主义的两次“旱季攻势”和不断的战争“升级”，并且开展攻势，取得了极其辉煌的战果。美帝国主义的处境十分狼狈。为了改变这种局面，美帝国主义正在力图扩大战争。它不仅在越南南方进行疯狂挣扎，在北方加紧狂轰滥炸，而且向中国人民进行了新的挑衅。这不能不引起中国人民的密切注视。我们要警告美帝国主义，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是吓不倒的。中国人民援助越南人民抗美救国战争的决心，是任何威胁也动摇不了的。你们犯下了罪行，是一定要受到惩罚的。为了保障中国货轮的安全，中国人民有权利采取一切必要的措施，由此而引起的一切后果，美帝国主义必须承担全部责任。
    新华社河内一日电穷凶极恶的美帝国主义不顾中国政府的严厉警告和愤怒谴责，又在十一月二十五日派遣飞机对中国停泊在越南北方鸿基港的货船进行了野蛮的袭击，使许多船员受伤，船体遭受损害。这是美国强盗在侵越战争中严重“升级”的同时，对中华人民共和国进行的极其严重的新的军事挑衅。
    十一月二十五日，中国货船红旗一五四号从海防抵达鸿基港口。当天下午十九点十分，美国强盗飞机就对中国货船进行俯冲投弹。炸弹在我国货船右侧外约十米处的水面上空爆炸，使八名船员受伤，船体受损达二十多处。在美国强盗飞机野蛮袭击时，我国货船全体船员进行了坚决的战斗，表现了英勇顽强的大无畏精神。
    美国的强盗飞机对中国货船的袭击已经不是第一次了。美帝国主义对中国人民所犯下的新的罪行，必将受到应得的惩罚。
