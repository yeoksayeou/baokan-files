Under the direction of American imperialism, Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, Foreign Minister Miki Takeo, and the "Defense Agency" head Masuda Koji separately held "talks" with the Chiang bandit leader Chiang Ching-kuo, intensifying their plot to conspire with the U.S., Japan, and Chiang to jointly oppose China.

During his stay in Japan, the traitor Chiang Ching-kuo also held secret "talks" with the war criminal and Japanese militarist Hayashi Shigeru and the head of the right-wing organization of the Liberal Democratic Party.

According to Japanese newspapers, Sato Eisaku introduced to Chiang Ching-kuo his activities in counter-revolutionary efforts in some Asian and Pacific countries and regions, as well as the content of his talks with the American masters. Sato boasted that Japan would actively participate in the American imperialist's hostile actions against China, expand the invasion of Vietnam, and suppress the national liberation movements in Asia. Both Japan and Chiang emphasized the need to strengthen military collusion to further serve the American imperialist's evil activities of "containing China" and expanding the invasion of Asia. The Japanese reactionary government leaders, in their secret talks with Chiang Ching-kuo, also expressed their intention to actively intervene in the Taiwan issue. This blatantly reveals that the resurgent Japanese militarism is once again harboring the wolfish ambition to invade our sacred territory of Taiwan.

When Chiang Ching-kuo arrived at Haneda Airport in Tokyo on November 27, he received the honor of being treated as a "government VIP" by the Japanese reactionaries, which was not accidental. Sato Eisaku's recent "visit" to Taiwan and Chiang Ching-kuo's current visit to Japan to engage in evil activities are part of the "anti-China encirclement" being plotted by the anti-China "holy alliance" of the U.S., Soviet Union, and Japan.

On the morning of the 28th, Chiang Ching-kuo held a secret talk with the "Defense Agency" head Masuda Koji, during which both sides expressed their intention to further strengthen military collusion. Chiang Ching-kuo humbly "welcomed" the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" to visit Taiwan. The Japanese government immediately agreed to provide military "assistance" to the Chiang bandits, helping them to "re-equip" the Chiang bandit army with Japanese-made weapons.

During his stay in Tokyo and Osaka, Chiang Ching-kuo also had frequent contacts with the heads of Japanese monopoly capital groups. It is revealed that Japanese militarists and monopoly capitalists have a great interest in "Taiwan" and have high "expectations" for this traitor.

Despite the protests and opposition of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the peoples of various Asian countries, Sato Eisaku, after his "visit" to Taiwan, brought the traitor Chiang Ching-kuo to Japan to jointly plot evil schemes against China.

Previously, the Sato government also openly dispatched the "Self-Defense Forces" fleet to intrude into our sacred territory of Taiwan last year. Japanese monopoly capitalists have been doing everything possible to intensify their infiltration into Taiwan, controlling the local economic lifelines. All this clearly shows that, under the patronage of American imperialism, the resurgent Japanese militarism is once again attempting to seize Taiwan and use it as a springboard to expand colonialism in Southeast Asia, dreaming of reviving the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

The Sato government's collusion with the Chiang bandits, allowing Chiang Ching-kuo to sneak into Japan to engage in anti-China evil activities, has aroused strong opposition from the Japanese people. During Chiang Ching-kuo's "visit" to Japan, he was protested and opposed wherever he went, like a rat crossing the street. The Japanese government deployed a large number of armed police and plainclothes agents to protect him layer by layer. On December 2, under the "special protection" of 5,000 police deployed by the Japanese government, Chiang Ching-kuo fled back to Taiwan in a disgraced manner.

    佐藤反动政府勾结蒋匪帮策划反华阴谋
    公然在美帝指使下拉政治僵尸蒋匪经国到日本密谋侵略活动
    据新华社东京四日电  在美帝国主义的指使下，日本反动政府首相佐藤荣作，外务大臣三木武夫和“防卫厅”长官增田甲子七分别同蒋匪帮头目蒋经国进行了“会谈”，加紧策划美、日、蒋勾结共同反华的新阴谋。
    卖国贼蒋经国在日本停留期间，还同大战犯、日本军国主义分子贺屋兴宣和自由民主党右翼组织负责人进行秘密“会谈”。
    据日本报纸透露，佐藤荣作在会谈中向蒋经国介绍了他到亚洲和大洋洲一些国家和地区进行反革命活动的情况以及和美国主子会谈的内容。佐藤在会谈中扬言日本要积极参与美帝敌视中国、扩大侵略越南和镇压亚洲民族解放运动的罪恶行径。日蒋双方鼓吹要加紧军事勾结，进一步为美帝国主义“遏制中国”、扩大侵略亚洲的罪恶活动效劳。日本反动政府头目在同蒋经国密谈时，还表示要积极插手台湾问题。这就露骨地表明：已经死灰复燃的日本军国主义，妄图再次侵占我国神圣领土台湾的狼子野心。
    蒋经国于十一月二十七日到达东京羽田机场时，受到了日本反动派以“政府贵宾”相待的礼遇，这决不是偶然的。佐藤荣作不久前“访问”台湾以及蒋经国这次到日本进行罪恶活动，是美苏日反华“神圣同盟”加紧策划的“反华包围圈”的一个组成部分。
    蒋经国二十八日上午同“防卫厅”长官增田甲子七举行密谈时，双方表示要进一步加紧军事上的勾结。蒋经国卑躬屈膝地“欢迎”日本“自卫队”到台湾进行“访问”。日本政府当即答应给予蒋匪帮军事上的“援助”，帮助蒋匪帮以日本制造的军火武器“重新改装”蒋匪军的装备。
    蒋经国在东京、大阪停留时，还同日本垄断资本集团头目进行了频繁的接触。据透露，日本军国主义者和垄断资本对“台湾有很大的兴趣”，并且对这个卖国贼抱有极大的“期待”。
    佐藤荣作不顾中国人民、日本人民以及亚洲各国人民的抗议和反对，在“访问”台湾之后，又把卖国贼蒋经国拉到日本共同策划反华的罪恶勾当。
    在此以前，佐藤政府还在去年公然派遣“自卫队”舰队，闯入我国神圣领土台湾。日本垄断资本也千方百计地加紧侵入台湾，控制当地的经济命脉。这一切清楚地表明，在美帝扶植下已经死灰复燃的日本军国主义，妄图再次霸占台湾，并以此为跳板，向东南亚进行殖民扩张，重温“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦。
    日本佐藤政府勾结蒋匪帮，让蒋经国溜进日本进行反华的罪恶活动，激起了日本人民的强烈反对。卖国贼蒋经国在日本“访问”期间，象过街老鼠一样，走到那里，就受到那里的日本人民和爱国华侨的抗议和反对。日本政府出动大批武装警察和便衣特务对他加以层层“保护”。十二月二日在日本政府出动五千名警察的“特别保护”下，蒋经国在大阪狼狈地溜进飞机滚回台湾。
