Long Live Our Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao!
Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new and higher stage. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism for the era in which imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is marching towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the entire Party and the entire nation.
