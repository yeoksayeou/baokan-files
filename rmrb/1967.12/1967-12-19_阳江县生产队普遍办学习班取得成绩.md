	Many production teams in the communes of Yangjiang County, Guangdong, have recently established study classes for Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought. Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in these team-run study classes, fighting against selfishness, and criticizing revisionism. Their political and ideological awareness has rapidly improved. They say, "In the past, our minds were filled with selfishness, and nothing made sense; after studying Chairman Mao's works, our minds are filled with Mao Zedong Thought, and everything makes sense, everything is for the public good." "Selfishness is the root of bitterness in the old society and the root of disaster in the new society. If we do not fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, it will be difficult to defend the country."

	The leading cadres at the county and commune levels in Yangjiang place great importance on and support the initiative of the masses in establishing study classes in the production teams.

　　阳江县生产队普遍办学习班取得成绩
    广东阳江县许多公社的生产队，最近普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班。广大贫下中农在队办的学习班里活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义，政治思想觉悟迅速提高。他们说，
  “过去头脑里有私字，这也不通，那也不通；学了毛主席著作，头脑里有了毛泽东思想，一通百通，样样为公。”“私字是旧社会的苦根，是新社会的祸根。斗私批修搞不好，江山就难保。”
    阳江县和公社两级的领导班子，对群众自动起来在生产队办学习班的首创精神很重视，也很支持。
