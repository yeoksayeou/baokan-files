The revolutionary masses of Zhuzhou have eliminated factionalism and achieved great unity, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions to learn and apply, seeing immediate results. They have held over 300 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, launching a new wave of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 8th: The proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary groups of Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, are closely following the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, uniting systematically, by industry, and by class to achieve revolutionary great unity. The situation of the Cultural Revolution in the entire city is excellent and getting better.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The broad revolutionary masses of various revolutionary mass organizations in Zhuzhou City have seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings, applied what they learned, and actively worked to eliminate factionalism, uniting systematically from the bottom up to achieve revolutionary great unity. Currently, 96% of factories, schools, departments, and enterprises in the city have united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, by system, by industry, and by class. On this basis, they have established unified revolutionary mass organizations such as the Municipal Workers' Congress and the Red Guards Congress, under the unified leadership of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, forming a vast army of cultural revolutionaries to launch a more vigorous attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev.

After achieving revolutionary great unity by system, Zhuzhou City has greatly promoted the establishment of temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. This issue must be resolved." Before achieving revolutionary great unity, some cross-industry revolutionary mass organizations had limited knowledge of the cadre situation in each unit and often had differing opinions on cadres. This made it difficult to correctly handle cadres and affected cadre work. After achieving revolutionary great unity by system, revolutionary masses have a good understanding of the cadre situation in their own units. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, they jointly conduct class analysis of cadres, considering their performance during the Cultural Revolution, as well as their entire history and work. This way, everyone's opinions are aligned, strengthening the political and ideological work on cadres and helping a large number of revolutionary cadres to stand out. Due to the strengthening of cadre work after achieving revolutionary great unity, so far, 44% of units in the city have established temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Achieving revolutionary great unity by system has ensured unified deployment and leadership, making the revolutionary criticism and struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit more effective. Currently, the wave of revolutionary criticism in the entire city is surging higher and higher.

Achieving revolutionary great unity by system has also ensured the implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Many revolutionary masses who previously participated in cross-industry organizations have, after achieving revolutionary great unity by workshop and team, found it easier to have unified leadership and arrangements in production. The number of people detached from production has also decreased, quickly launching a wave of grasping revolution and promoting production. The city's total industrial output value increased by 8.9% in September compared to August, and again in October compared to September.

After our great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Zhuzhou City immediately established over 300 Mao Zedong Thought study classes by system and by unit, with more than 16,000 revolutionary group leaders, revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and PLA soldiers participating in the study. They have led the broad proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses to launch a new wave of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination at the ideological level, and more broadly and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. The proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary masses of the entire city are determined to advance victoriously and swear to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

    毛主席最新指示，学了就用，立竿见影
    株洲革命群众消除派性实现大联合
    举办三百多个毛泽东思想学习班，掀起活学活用毛主席著作新高潮
    据新华社长沙八日电　湖南省株洲市无产阶级革命派和革命群众，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，纷纷按照系统、按照行业、按照班级实行革命大联合，全市无产阶级文化大革命的形势一片大好，越来越好。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”株洲市各革命群众组织的广大革命群众，认真学习毛主席的教导，学了就用，纷纷削平山头，按照系统，自下而上地实行革命的大联合。目前，全市已有百分之九十六的工厂、学校、部门、企业单位，在毛泽东思想的基础上，按照系统、按照行业、按照班级联合起来。在这个基础上，成立了市工代会、红代会等统一的革命群众组织，在市革命委员会筹备小组的统一领导下，组成了浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派发起了更加猛烈的进攻。
    株洲市按系统实现革命大联合以后，大大地促进了革命三结合的临时权力机构的建立。毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”在没有实现革命大联合以前，一些跨行业的革命群众组织，对各单位的干部情况不大了解，对干部的看法往往不一致。这样，就不能正确地对待干部，影响了干部工作的进行。按系统实现革命大联合后，革命群众对本单位的干部情况很了解，大家遵照毛主席的教导，一起对干部进行阶级分析，既看他们在文化大革命中的表现，又看他们的全部历史和全部工作。这样，大家看法一致了，加强了干部的政治思想工作，促使一大批革命干部站了出来。由于实现革命大联合以后加强了干部工作，到目前为止，全市已有百分之四十四的单位建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构。
    按系统实现了革命大联合，有了统一部署，统一领导，革命大批判和本单位斗批改开展得更有成效。目前，全市革命大批判的高潮一浪高过一浪。
    按系统实现了革命大联合，更保证了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的贯彻执行。许多过去参加跨行业组织的革命群众，在实现了按车间、班组的革命大联合以后，在生产上，便于统一领导，统一安排，脱产人员也减少了，全市很快掀起了抓革命、促生产的高潮。全市工业总产值九月份比八月份增长百分之八点九，十月份比九月份又有增长。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召以后，株洲市无产阶级革命派立即按系统、按单位办起了三百多个毛泽东思想学习班，有一万六千多名革命群众组织负责人、革命群众、革命干部和解放军指战员参加了学习。他们带动广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，进一步从思想上巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，更加广泛深入地开展革命大批判和本单位的斗批改。全市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，决心乘胜前进，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
