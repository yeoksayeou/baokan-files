At the moment when we are following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, fighting bravely on the battlefield of criticizing and repudiating revisionism, riding the winds and breaking the waves, and advancing towards victory, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin gave us the inscription: "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." These sixteen shining golden words expound the great truth of the proletarian revolution and express the feelings of our revolutionary fighters.

Our ships sail on the ocean, and we are not lost in a thousand layers of fog, we dare to resist a typhoon of level twelve, and we dare to bury the warships of the number one imperialist. All this is due to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Once, when we went to sea on a mission, the compass that indicates the direction was damaged during the voyage. The captain was not present, the deputy captain had just taken office, and most of the crew were new soldiers. What should we do? Could we bring the ship back? Comrades spontaneously took out the red book of Chairman Mao and loudly recited: "When our comrades are in difficulties, they should see achievements, see light, and raise our courage." Chairman Mao's teachings were like the brightest navigation light, illuminating our path forward and giving us boundless strength. Comrades confidently said: "We have Mao Zedong Thought as the best 'compass,' and we will definitely be able to reach our destination." The deputy captain, following Chairman Mao's teachings on believing in the masses and relying on the masses, called the crew together for thorough political and ideological mobilization. Then, he assigned tasks: some observed the channel, some steered, some operated the machinery, and some stood guard. The entire crew formed a fighting unit. Without a compass, we used binoculars to observe sea targets and determined the direction based on our memory of the route. The ship slowly moved forward. But soon, it grew dark, and there wasn't even a star to be seen. The targets were unclear, the channel had many mountains, reefs, and turns, and the difficulties increased. At this moment, everyone sang the song of Chairman Mao's quotations: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Comrades were instantly full of energy and resolutely moved forward. The comrades observing the route crouched at the bow or stood on the command platform, eyes wide open, searching for sea targets and observing the channel. The sea wind mercilessly tore at their clothes, and the waves splashed on them. Some comrades' eyes were stung by seawater, but they paid no heed. The deputy captain judged the direction based on the targets and continuously issued orders to the helm... In this way, we slowly forged ahead and finally reached our destination the next morning. The soldiers deeply felt from practice: without a compass, it doesn't matter; the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the best "compass," the brightest navigation light; with it, we will never lose our way.

Beloved Vice Chairman Lin: We will definitely not disappoint your expectations! We are determined to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, and to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We will forever advance bravely along the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao!

    伟大舵手指方向　乘风破浪不迷航
    海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表、二等功臣、某部指导员　杨俊龙
    正当我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在斗私批修的战场上勇敢拚杀，乘风破浪，胜利前进的时候，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席给我们题词：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。这十六个金光闪闪的大字，阐明了无产阶级革命的伟大真理，说出了我们革命战士的心里话。
    我们的舰艇驰骋在海洋上，千重雾帐不迷航，十二级台风敢顶抗，头号帝国主义的军舰敢埋葬，靠的就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。有一次，我们出海执行任务，航渡中，指示航向的罗经损坏了，艇长不在，副艇长任职不久，艇员又多数是新战士。怎么办？能不能把艇开回去？同志们不约而同地捧出了红彤彤的毛主席的宝书，高声朗诵：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的教导就象一盏最最明亮的导航灯，照亮了我们前进的道路，给我们增添了无穷的力量。同志们满怀信心地说：“我们有毛泽东思想这个最好的‘罗经’，我们就一定能航行到目的地。”副艇长根据毛主席关于相信群众、依靠群众的教导，把艇员们召集在一起，作了充分的政治思想动员，然后作了分工：有的观察航道，有的操舵，有的掌管机器，有的战斗值班，全艇人员组成了一个战斗的整体。没有罗经，我们用望远镜观察海上目标，根据平时的记忆，确定航向。艇慢慢往前开。但不久，天渐渐黑下来，连个星星也没有。目标看不清，航道上山多，礁石多，转弯多，困难愈来愈大了。这时候，大家高唱毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”同志们顿时浑身是劲，坚定地往前开。观察了望的同志趴在艇首或站在指挥台上，睁大眼睛，搜索海上目标，观察航道。海风无情地撕扯着他们的衣服，海浪扑打在他们身上，有的同志眼睛被海水浸得生痛，也在所不顾。副艇长根据目标判断航向，不断下达舵令……就这样，慢慢地往前闯呀闯，终于在第二天早晨，胜利到达目的地。战士们从实践中深深体会到：没有罗经不要紧，战无不胜的毛泽东思想就是最好的“罗经”，就是最亮的导航灯；有了它，我们永远也不会迷航。
    敬爱的林副主席呵：我们一定不辜负您的期望！决心把毛泽东思想真正学到手，大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，永远沿着毛主席他老人家给我们开辟的革命航道奋勇前进！
