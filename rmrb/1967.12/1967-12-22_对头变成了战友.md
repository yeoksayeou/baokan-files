One morning, a pink notice appeared in the big-character poster column of the Beijing Dyeing and Printing Factory. It shone brightly in the sunlight. This was the list of employees participating in the Mao Zedong Thought Study Class. Workers passing by were attracted to it. Everyone was happy that the factory was holding a study class, but some also had a lot to say:

	“Those two rivals from our workshop, if they are put together to study, it would be a miracle if they don’t clash.”
	“Studying together is good, but if factionalism isn’t eliminated, it’s all for nothing!”

These comments were not without basis. The original branch secretary of the Assembly Workshop, Lu Yuanzhang, had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, causing serious opposition and estrangement between him and the revolutionary workers in the workshop. The revolutionary faction and young female worker Qu Dajia had seriously fought against Lu Yuanzhang’s mistakes. For over a year, the two had not spoken to each other, becoming “rivals.”

Once the study class list was announced, both of them had their own plans. Lu Yuanzhang planned to remain silent. Qu Dajia, on the other hand, planned to keep her distance from Lu Yuanzhang, letting him fight his own battles while she fought hers.

However, the first day of the study class started off well. The PLA comrades gave a mobilizing lecture on “Criticizing and Repudiating Revisionism,” which deeply moved every student. Qu Dajia returned to her dormitory but couldn’t fall asleep for a long time. She thought: Chairman Mao said, “Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. This issue must be resolved.” How have I done? Have I treated Lu Yuanzhang in accordance with Chairman Mao’s teachings? She thought, although Lu Yuanzhang had made serious mistakes, he was just like her, a victim of the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev; moreover, he had repeatedly checked himself with the masses and had awakened. The proletarian revolutionary faction should adopt an attitude of “one look, two helps,” and “cure the illness and save the person” towards him, not treating him as an irreconcilable “rival.” Therefore, she made up her mind to listen to Chairman Mao’s words and do more self-criticism. In the study class, Qu Dajia exposed her “selfish” thoughts on the cadre issue and actively sought out Lu Yuanzhang to fight against selfishness together.

Qu Dajia invited Lu Yuanzhang to have a heart-to-heart talk, and Lu Yuanzhang agreed verbally. However, as soon as the study class was over, he found an excuse to go home. Qu Dajia was turned away and was very angry: “He still acts superior when I invite him. Why should I talk to him?” But she thought again: to correctly handle cadres, this is not just a personal issue, but a matter related to the revolutionary cause. How can one retreat when encountering some setbacks?

The next day, Qu Dajia sincerely talked to him about her selfish thoughts on the cadre issue. Lu Yuanzhang was very moved and said, “I was wrong. I did not correctly handle the Cultural Revolution and did not correctly handle the masses.”

The great Mao Zedong Thought turned these two “rivals” into comrades.

    对头变成了战友
    一天清晨，北京印染厂的大字报栏里，新贴了一张粉红色的纸，在阳光下闪闪发光。这是厂里参加毛泽东思想学习班的学员名单。路过这里的职工，被它吸引住了。大家为厂里举办学习班而高兴，但也有人议论纷纷：
    “我们车间的这两个对头，放在一起学习，不崩就好了。”
    “一起学习好是好，派性不去掉，白搭！”
    这些议论不是没有根据的。整装车间原总支书记路元祥，执行过资产阶级反动路线，和车间的革命职工造成了严重的对立和隔阂。车间的革命派、青年女工曲大家，对路元祥的错误，进行了严肃的斗争。一年多来，他们两人互不往来，互不说话，成了“对头”。
    学习班名单一公布，他俩都打好了小算盘。路元祥准备来个一言不发。曲大家呢？她准备对路元祥“井水不犯河水”，你斗你的私，我斗我的私。
    可是，第一天的学习，开了一个好头。解放军同志给大家上的“斗私，批修”动员课，深深地打动了每个学员的心。曲大家回到宿舍后，久久没有睡着。她想：毛主席说，“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”我做得怎样呢？我过去对待路元祥，符不符合毛主席的教导呢？她想，路元祥虽然有较严重的错误，但是和自己一样，同是中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的受害者；况且他已经多次向群众作了检查，有了觉悟。无产阶级革命派对他应当采取“一看二帮”、“治病救人”的态度，不应当把他看成势不两立的“对头”。因此，她下定决心听毛主席的话，多做自我批评。在学习班上，曲大家亮出了在干部问题上的“私”字，并主动去找路元祥，同他一起斗私。
    曲大家约路元祥一起谈心，路元祥嘴上答应，可是一到学习班放学，就借故回家了。曲大家吃了闭门羹，一肚子气：“请他还要摆架子，我为什么偏要同你谈呢？”但又一想：要正确对待干部，这不是我个人的问题，是关系到革命事业的问题。怎么碰到一些挫折就后退呢？
    第二天，曲大家诚恳地向他谈出了在对待干部问题上的私心杂念。路元祥听了非常激动，他说：“我错了，是我没有正确对待文化大革命，没有正确对待群众。”
    伟大的毛泽东思想，把这两个“对头”变成了战友。
