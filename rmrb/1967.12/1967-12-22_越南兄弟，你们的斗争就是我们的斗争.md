On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, on behalf of the 700 million Chinese people, sent a telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, expressing the most enthusiastic congratulations to the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation. In the telegram, Chairman Mao highly praised the heroic South Vietnamese people for their great victories in the anti-American national salvation war, setting a brilliant example for all oppressed peoples and nations in their struggle for liberation. Chairman Mao's telegram is the strongest support for the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, greatly encouraging the fighting spirit and iron will of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

Chairman Mao's telegram is a great call to arms for the revolutionary people of the world: it calls on all oppressed peoples and nations to take up arms, to wage armed revolution against armed counter-revolution, to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, and to strive for complete liberation, just as the heroic South Vietnamese people have done.

Chairman Mao's telegram once again tells the people of the world: people's war is invincible. Only by fully mobilizing the people, relying firmly on the people, and waging a people's war, can any powerful enemy be made to perish in the vast ocean of people's war. Two years ago, the vicious U.S. imperialists sent F-104 fighter jets to invade our country, which were shot down by us in one fell swoop. The American pilot Smith, who parachuted to escape, was immediately captured by our heroic militia. This fact fully proves that no matter what new weapons the U.S. imperialists use, or how cunning the enemy is, or what tricks they play, they will all be thoroughly defeated in the face of the iron wall of the people.

In just seven years, the heroic South Vietnamese people, under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front, have defeated the special warfare of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and are now defeating the U.S. imperialists' limited warfare. They have defeated 1.2 million U.S. expeditionary forces, puppet armies, and mercenaries equipped with various modern weapons and war tools, leaving them in a state of utter defeat and helplessness. Ultimately, this is the great victory of people's war.

In the telegram, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our two countries are neighboring countries that depend on each other. Our two peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. 'Your struggle is our struggle.'"

We, the naval soldiers, will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, highly carry forward the spirit of internationalism, and pledge to be the strong backbone of the Vietnamese people. We will regard the victory of the Vietnamese people as our own victory and their struggle as our own struggle. As soon as our great leader Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately rush to the battlefield in Vietnam, fight side by side with the heroic Vietnamese people, and share life and death with them, burying the U.S. aggressors thoroughly in the vast ocean of people's war!

    越南兄弟，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争
    海军学习毛主席著作积极分子、一等功臣　高翔
    在越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年之际，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，代表七亿中国人民致电阮友寿主席，向战斗中的越南人民表示最热烈的祝贺。在贺电中，毛主席高度地赞扬了英雄的越南南方人民在抗美救国战争中取得伟大的胜利，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。毛主席的贺电，是对越南人民和世界人民最强有力的支持，极大地鼓舞了越南人民和世界人民的战斗勇气和钢铁意志。
    毛主席的贺电，是向世界革命人民发出的伟大的战斗动员令：号召全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族，象英雄的越南南方人民那样，拿起枪杆子，用武装的革命反对武装的反革命，推翻帝国主义的反动统治，争取彻底的解放。
    毛主席的贺电，再一次告诉全世界人民：人民战争是所向无敌的。只有充分发动人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，才能迫使任何强大的敌人在人民战争的汪洋大海中陷于灭顶之灾。两年前，凶恶的美帝国主义派遣强盗飞机F—104侵入我国，被我们一举击落后，美国飞贼史密斯跳伞逃命，立即被我英雄民兵活捉了。这一事实充分证明，不管美帝国主义使用什么样的新式武器，也不管敌人怎样狡猾，玩弄什么花招，在人民群众结成的铜墙铁壁面前，都要彻底完蛋。
    在短短的七年间，英雄的越南南方人民在民族解放阵线的正确领导下，打败了美帝国主义及其走狗的特种战争，目前正在打败美帝国主义的局部战争，把拥有各种现代化武器和战争工具的一百二十万美国远征军、伪军和仆从军打得一败涂地，一筹莫展。归根结底，这是人民战争的伟大胜利。
    毛主席在贺电中指出：“我们两国是唇齿相依的邻邦。我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。”“你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。”
    我们海军战士坚决遵照毛主席的教导，高度发扬国际主义精神，誓作越南人民的坚强后盾，把越南人民的胜利看作自己的胜利，把越南人民的斗争看作自己的斗争，只要我们的伟大领袖毛主席一声令下，就立即奔赴越南战场，和英雄的越南人民生死与共，并肩战斗，把美国侵略者彻底埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海之中！
