The revolutionary cadres of Xiyang County in Shanxi Province, after seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in February this year, have adopted various forms of education, such as holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to positively educate the broad masses of grassroots cadres in rural areas, achieving remarkable results. The revolutionary cadres of Xiyang County regard this work as an extremely important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and a key to carrying out the cultural revolution in rural areas.

Two fundamentally opposed lines

Whether to believe in and rely on the majority of rural grassroots cadres, and to adopt a positive educational approach towards their shortcomings and mistakes; or to harbor enmity towards them, and to adopt a policy of ruthless struggle and merciless blows, is an important sign that distinguishes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from the reactionary bourgeois line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

On this issue, Xiyang County has undergone a fierce class struggle.

Before 1960, the leadership of Xiyang County was in the hands of revolutionary leading cadres who implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. During this period, cadres at all levels in the county were united and achieved great results in various socialist revolutionary movements and socialist construction. However, in 1961, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi Province usurped the leadership of Xiyang County. In the following six years, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party in Xiyang County, harboring deep hatred towards the poor and lower-middle peasants, repeatedly persecuted and destroyed the rural grassroots cadres. Especially in October 1964, they labeled more than 80 cadres in Xiyang County who insisted on Chairman Mao's correct line as an "anti-party clique." The number of cadres in communes and production brigades who were implicated was even greater, including those in Dazhai Brigade, which Chairman Mao personally established. During the Four Clean-ups movement, they used the Four Clean-ups as a cover to restore capitalism, promoting the black "Taoyuan Experience" and implementing the reactionary bourgeois line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number." In twelve communes, thousands of grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants were persecuted. The policy of ruthless struggle against rural grassroots cadres was a major step taken by the Chinese Khrushchev to usurp rural power.

Understand the situation of rural grassroots cadres

Believing in and relying on the majority of cadres is Chairman Mao's consistent thought. The revolutionary cadres of Xiyang County believe that one must have a clear understanding of the situation of rural grassroots cadres. Xiyang County is an old revolutionary base area where land reform was thoroughly carried out, and the poor and lower-middle peasants have a high level of consciousness. About 80 to 90 percent of the rural grassroots cadres are from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds and are active elements who emerged during the land reform and cooperativization movements. They have undergone good tempering and testing in various political movements and have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao, firmly following Chairman Mao's lead. In their work, they have various shortcomings and mistakes, but very few are of a directional and line nature. They should be helped to raise their consciousness and stand up to work.

However, at the beginning of the rural cultural revolution, Xiyang County was also affected by petty-bourgeois ideology. A few malicious individuals stirred up trouble, created chaos, and disrupted agricultural production. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements were also active behind the scenes. Some production brigades had instances of arbitrarily seizing power from the proletariat. The core group of the Xiyang County Party Committee and the county revolutionary committee insisted on investigation and research, correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, and seriously handling issues. For all grassroots cadres who had made mistakes, as long as the nature of their mistakes belonged to contradictions among the people, they adopted an attitude of "one protection, two assists." At that time, to help the masses analyze the situation of cadres from a class perspective, Comrade Chen Yonggui and other responsible comrades went deep into all 20 communes and more than 300 brigades in the county to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. Whether they were proletarian leaders in power or revolutionary cadres with shortcomings and mistakes, they let the masses discuss and study, and through mass criticism and education, helped them stand up to revolution. However, they would not let a single bad element slip by. In some places, especially where fake Four Clean-ups had been carried out, some class enemies and ghosts and monsters had infiltrated the grassroots cadres. During the cultural revolution, some of these people appeared in extremely "leftist" disguises, muddying the waters; some were extremely reactionary. These people should be exposed, criticized, and struggled against by the masses, rooted out, and thoroughly criticized. For the counter-revolutionary activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, they should be firmly suppressed. After more than 40 days of work, now 96 percent of the production brigade cadres in the county have stood up, and the vast majority have taken on leadership roles, playing a backbone role in leading the movement and organizing production.

Several methods of positive education

The methods used by the core group of the Xiyang County Party Committee and the county revolutionary committee to positively educate rural grassroots cadres are mainly three: holding various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes; conducting a thorough revolutionary criticism; and launching a movement to learn from and catch up with Dazhai. These three methods are carried out in combination with each other.

Holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the main method used by the proletarian revolutionary cadres of Xiyang County to positively educate rural grassroots cadres. From April to October, they held 15 sessions, training 1,800 people. After October, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the entire county launched a wave of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with a total of 640-plus classes and more than 56,000 participants. Rural brigades also organized study classes during their spare time, inviting brigade cadres and active poor and lower-middle peasants to participate, studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and fiercely criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Through study, the broad masses of grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants have a clear understanding of the struggle between the two lines over the past 17 years, realizing that the fundamental issue of the struggle between the two lines is the issue of power. If the poor and lower-middle peasants do not hold power well, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists will seize power, and the socialist mountains and rivers will change color. This is something the poor and lower-middle peasants will never allow.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres of Xiyang County also thoroughly carried out the revolutionary criticism movement throughout the county to positively educate rural grassroots cadres. They held several criticism meetings with representatives from various brigades and production teams, and each commune also held multiple criticism meetings. The criticism meetings used great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, directly aiming at the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the province and county, exposing and denouncing the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes of implementing the "strike down a large number and protect a small number" policy against cadres; exposing and criticizing various fallacies propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the theory of the extinction of class struggle, the theory of the merits of exploitation, the "three autonomies and one contract," and the "four freedoms." At the same time, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionary cadres and grassroots cadres exposed the capitalist-roaders within the Party at the county level, struggling against them face-to-face, exposing their crimes of promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, advocating large private plots, implementing the responsibility system to households, and engaging in material incentives, making everyone more clearly see the cunning intentions of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism.

In the criticism, the broad masses of rural grassroots cadres used the method of "three remembrances and three comparisons," that is, remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing the sweetness of the new society; remembering the heinous crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and comparing the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution; remembering the Party's cultivation and education of oneself and comparing one's contributions to the Party. In the criticism of revisionism, they fiercely struggled against the "self" and seriously examined their thoughts. This made the criticism deeper and more thorough each time, rapidly raising class consciousness. For example, some grassroots cadres who had been persecuted by the reactionary bourgeois line said in the criticism: "During the Four Clean-ups, I was struck down by the capitalist-roaders, and I thought the Party's policy had changed and no longer relied on us poor and lower-middle peasants. I decided never to be a cadre and never to let my descendants be cadres. Now I understand that this is the Chinese Khrushchev trying to seize our power. The thought of not being a cadre is wrong. We poor and lower-middle peasants must hold power. If we do not hold power, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements will seize power."

The main feature of Xiyang County's movement to learn from Dazhai is to take Dazhai, which holds high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, as a model. A mass movement to learn from and catch up with Dazhai, to walk the Dazhai path, to have the Dazhai spirit, to promote the Dazhai style, to build Dazhai fields, and to catch up with Dazhai production is vigorously carried out throughout the county.

To deeply and thoroughly learn the spirit of Dazhai, the core group of the Xiyang County Party Committee and the county revolutionary committee once placed the study classes for rural grassroots cadres in Dazhai, letting everyone labor and study together with the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, listen to the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai give lectures, and at the same time conduct field trips, achieving a combination of learning and using. After the study, many grassroots cadres had a clear understanding. They said, "In the past, we also learned from Dazhai, but we could not grasp the spiritual essence and did not take 'struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism' as the key link. The experience of Dazhai, in a word, is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively and thoroughly."

After more than half a year of intensive study and criticism, the spiritual outlook of the rural grassroots cadres in Xiyang has undergone tremendous changes. In the current cold season, a revolutionary fervor is surging everywhere, and winter production and agricultural infrastructure construction are being vigorously carried out, presenting a thriving scene. Struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism has become a social norm. Selfless and public-spirited good deeds are emerging in large numbers. The enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for production has reached an unprecedented level. This year, the total grain output of the county increased by 40 percent compared to last year, the highest in history. Various systems such as industry, transportation, commerce, finance, and education have also achieved remarkable results.

    活学活用毛主席著作坚持正面教育农村基层干部
    昔阳通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，开展革命大批判和学赶大寨运动，广大农村基层干部对两条道路斗争心明眼亮，精神面貌发生巨大变化，生产积极性空前高涨
    本报讯　山西省昔阳县无产阶级革命派，在今年二月夺了党内一小撮走资派的权以后，采取大办毛泽东思想学习班等形式，对广大农村基层干部进行正面教育，取得了显著成果。昔阳县革命派把这个工作看作是毛主席伟大战略部署的一个极重要的组成部分，是搞好农村基层文化大革命的关键。
    两条根本对立的路线
    是相信和依靠农村基层干部的大多数，对他们的缺点和错误采取正面教育的方针；还是仇视他们、对他们实行残酷斗争、无情打击，这是区别毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的一个重要标志。
    在这个问题上，昔阳县经历了一场激烈的阶级斗争。
    一九六○年以前，昔阳县的领导权掌握在革命领导干部手里，贯彻执行了毛主席的干部政策。这个时期，全县各级干部是团结的，在历次社会主义革命运动和社会主义建设中创造了很大成绩。但是，一九六一年，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山西省的代理人，篡夺了昔阳县的领导权。在其后的六年内，昔阳县党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，怀着对贫下中农的刻骨仇恨，对农村基层干部进行多次大迫害、大摧残。特别在一九六四年十月，把昔阳县八十多个坚持毛主席正确路线的干部，打成“反党集团”，受牵连的公社、生产大队干部就更多，连毛主席亲自树立起来的大寨大队的干部也无例外。在四清运动中，他们借四清之名，行复辟资本主义之实，推行黑“桃园经验”，执行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，十二个公社受迫害的基层干部及贫下中农骨干分子竟达数千人。对农村基层干部采取残酷斗争的政策，是中国赫鲁晓夫篡夺农村政权的重大步骤。
    对农村基层干部的状况要心中有底
    相信和依靠干部的大多数，是毛主席一贯的思想。昔阳县的革命派认为，对农村的基层干部的状况，心中要有个底，要有个基本的了解。昔阳县是老区，土地改革比较彻底，贫下中农的觉悟很高，农村基层干部百分之八、九十是贫下中农出身，大都是土地改革和合作化运动中涌现出来的积极分子，在历次政治运动中受到了很好的锻炼和考验。他们无限热爱毛主席，是坚决跟着毛主席走的。在工作中他们有这样那样的缺点、错误，但属于方向路线性的是很少的，应当帮助他们提高认识，让他们站出来工作。
    但是，昔阳在农村文化大革命刚刚开始的时候，也受到了小资产阶级思想的冲击。少数别有用心的人煽阴风，点邪火，制造混乱，破坏农业生产。地、富、反、坏也在背后活动。一些生产大队，发生过胡乱地向无产阶级夺权的现象。中共昔阳县核心小组、县革委会坚持调查研究，正确分清两类矛盾，严肃处理问题。对一切犯过错误的基层干部，其错误的性质只要属于人民内部矛盾，都采取一保二帮的态度。当时为了帮助群众用阶级观点分析干部的情况，陈永贵同志和其他负责人，深入到全县二十个公社，三百多个大队，宣传贯彻毛主席的干部政策。是无产阶级当权派，或者是有缺点和错误的革命干部，都让群众讨论研究，通过群众性的批评教育，帮助他们站出来革命。但是，也决不放过一个坏人。在一些地方，特别是在进行过假“四清”的地方，基层干部中混进了一些阶级异己分子、牛鬼蛇神。这些人在文化大革命中，有的以极“左”的面貌出现，混水摸鱼；有的表现极为反动。对这些人，要发动群众揭发、批判、斗争，把他们揪出来，批深批透，斗倒斗臭。对地、富、反、坏的反革命活动，则坚决进行镇压。经过前后四十多天的工作，现在全县生产队干部已有百分之九十六站了出来，绝大多数担负了领导职务，在领导运动和组织生产两方面起了骨干作用。
    几种正面教育的方法
    中共昔阳县核心小组、县革委会正面教育农村基层干部的方法，主要有三种：一是举办各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班；二是搞好革命大批判；三是掀起学赶大寨的运动。这三种方法是相互结合进行的。
    大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，是昔阳县无产阶级革命派对农村基层干部进行正面教育的主要方法。从四月到十月，他们共办了十五期，训练了一千八百人。十月以后，根据林彪同志关于要办好毛泽东思想学习班的指示，全县掀起了举办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮，学习班共有六百四十多个，参加的人数五万六千多人。农村各大队也都利用业余时间组织学习班，吸收生产队干部和贫下中农积极分子参加，大学“老三篇”，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线。通过学习，广大基层干部和贫下中农，对十七年来两条道路斗争心明眼亮，认识到两条道路斗争的根本问题是政权问题，贫下中农不掌好权，地、富、反、坏、右就要掌权，社会主义江山就要变颜色。这是贫下中农坚决不答应的。
    昔阳县的无产阶级革命派还在全县范围内深入地开展革命大批判运动，对农村基层干部进行正面教育。他们召开过几次有各大队和生产队代表参加的批判大会，各公社也多次召开过批判会。批判会以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，把矛头直接指向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在省内、县内的代理人，揭露和控诉中国赫鲁晓夫对干部实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的滔天罪行；揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等各种谬论。同时广大无产阶级革命派和基层干部，把县级机关党内走资派揪出来进行面对面的斗争，揭发他们推行反革命修正主义路线，鼓吹大种自留地，实行包产到户，大搞物质刺激等罪行，使大家更加认清了中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的毒辣用心。
    在大批判中，广大农村基层干部采用了“三忆三比”的办法，即忆旧社会之苦，比新社会之甜；忆党内一小撮走资派的滔天罪行，比无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成就；忆党对自己的培养教育，比自己对党的贡献。在批修中狠斗“私”字，认真检查自己的思想。这样就使大批判一次比一次深刻，越批越透，迅速提高了阶级觉悟。如有的受过资产阶级反动路线迫害的基层干部，在大批判中检查自己的错误认识时说：“‘四清’时我受到走资派的打击，我以为党的政策变了，不依靠我们贫下中农了，下决心一辈子不当干部，子子孙孙不当干部。现在我才明白这是中国赫鲁晓夫要夺我们的权。不当干部的思想是错误的，我们贫下中农就是要掌权。我们不掌权，地、富、反、坏就会掌权。”
    昔阳县的学大寨运动的主要特点是以高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的大寨为样板。一个走大寨路，长大寨志，学大寨人，兴大寨风，建大寨田，赶大寨产的学赶大寨的群众运动，正在全县蓬勃开展。
    为了把大寨精神学深、学透，中共昔阳县核心小组、县革委会曾经把农村基层干部的学习班放在大寨，让大家同大寨贫下中农一起劳动，一起学习，听大寨贫下中农讲课，同时进行参观访问，做到边听，边议，边干，学用结合。在学习结束后，许多基层干部心明眼亮。他们说，过去也学大寨，但是抓不住精神实质，没有以“斗私，批修”为纲。大寨的经验，千条万条，归根结蒂，活学活用毛主席著作是第一条。
    经过半年多来的大学习和大批判，昔阳农村基层干部的精神面貌发生了巨大变化。在当前天寒地冻的季节，一股革命的热流到处滚动，到处在紧张进行冬季生产和农田基本建设，出现一派大好景象。斗私批修，已变成社会风气。一心为公，舍己为公的好人好事大量涌现。干部和群众的生产积极性空前高涨。今年全县粮食总产量比去年增长四成，是历史上产量最高的一年。工业、交通、财贸、文教各个系统都做出了显著的成绩。
