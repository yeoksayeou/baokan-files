	Editor's Note: Chairman Mao recently instructed that military study classes should include soldiers, which is a major measure to address the issue of cadres through education and to improve cadre-mass relations. This teaches us broad revolutionary cadres to always stay with the masses, respectfully learn from the masses, accept education from the masses, and obtain help from the masses, continuously promote our ideological revolution, and do a better job of revolutionary work. Comrade Li Mingyou's personal experience well illustrates this point.

	In the midst of war, Li Mingyou fought alongside the soldiers, forging a deep bond of camaraderie. However, after achieving several merits and gaining some fame, he began to act superior and became increasingly distant from the soldiers, as if a wall had been erected between them.

	When a cadre is separated from the masses by a wall, their heart is separated by a mountain. If cadres detach themselves from the masses, they cannot love what the masses love, hate what the masses hate, or be concerned about what the masses are concerned about. They cannot be in sync with the masses, and if this continues, they may deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and stray onto the wrong path.

	Therefore, all revolutionary cadres must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often naive and laughable." We must always be Chairman Mao's students and the masses' students, frequently go among the masses, humbly learn from the masses, and sincerely accept the masses' criticism and supervision. This way, "as long as we do not detach ourselves from the masses, we will definitely be victorious."

	Chairman Mao recently taught us: "Military study classes should include soldiers," and "in a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." Chairman Mao's instructions are of great importance. Looking at the actual situation, cadres often make mistakes starting from detaching themselves from the masses. To correct mistakes, one must first return to the masses, humbly listen to the masses' opinions, accept the masses' criticism and help, and fundamentally establish a mass perspective. This is a profound ideological revolution, a process of criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Below, I will share some of my experiences of going among the masses, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together with the masses, changing my worldview, and promoting ideological revolution.

	Having an "official attitude" leads to detachment from the masses

	In the past, I often went to the companies, but it was to inspect work and educate others. With an "official attitude," I had no regard for the masses, only saw faults, and only spoke while others listened. Once, I took a small car to the third company's production point to inspect the spring planting situation. As soon as I got out of the car, I saw that the soldiers were not following my spring planting plan, and I got angry. I immediately called the political instructor Li Guojun over and scolded him without asking questions. The soldiers whispered behind my back: "The 'official' from the south is managing the north's affairs, even making new rules for farming, how impressive!" Later, I found out that my spring planting plan did not suit the climate of the Northeast. Political instructor Li Guojun and most of the soldiers were from the Northeast and knew best when and how to plant. I did not humbly learn from them but instead acted superior and scolded them. This lesson hit me like a stick.

	I thought: Why have I become more and more distant from the soldiers in recent years? Once this question was raised, scenes from when I was a platoon leader and company commander flashed before my eyes. At that time, I lived among the soldiers, discussed matters with them, planned battle strategies together, and brainstormed solutions to difficulties together. However, after winning a few battles and receiving several first-class merits, my fame spread, and I mistakenly thought I had "two sets" of skills. I no longer wanted to be a student of the soldiers. Later, when I became a regimental cadre, I felt even more like an important "official." This way, most of my time was spent in the office, handling documents, and taking calls, isolating myself from the soldiers.

	Reflecting on all this, I was shocked. Chairman Mao had long warned us: "Only by representing the masses can one educate the masses. Only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses. If one sees oneself as the master of the masses and a noble above the 'lower classes,' then no matter how talented they are, they are not needed by the masses, and their work has no future." This made me deeply realize: My changing distance from the soldiers was not just a change in position but more importantly, a change in my thoughts and feelings. The Party and the people placed me in a leadership position, which is a trust. I should maintain the spirit of an ordinary soldier, but I turned it into a burden. I seriously detached myself from the masses and deviated from Chairman Mao's teachings. This is how dangerous it is!

	Breaking down the wall of isolation from the masses, becoming a student of the masses

	This change is a change centered around "self," marking the beginning of detaching from the masses and elevating oneself. Isn't it often from detaching from the masses and acting like an official that some people become revisionists? As soon as I thought of this, I felt a chill. I then made up my mind to go among the masses and fiercely fight against "self" and criticize revisionism. Thus, I put on my backpack and went to the first company.

	When I arrived at the first company, I wanted to stay in the second platoon, but the company's cadres pulled me aside and said with concern: "Comrade Commander, it's better to stay in the company headquarters! The platoon has many people, and it's not good for rest; here, it's just a wall away from the second platoon." At that time, I also thought I was old and had high blood pressure, so staying in the company headquarters was not far from the soldiers. However, when I went to the classes and platoons to participate in study and discussion at night, the atmosphere in the class I went to would "stall." Although I explained repeatedly, everyone still did not dare to speak out boldly. Some who gathered the courage to say a few words would start with: "I haven't thought it through, if there are any mistakes, please correct me, Comrade Commander." Why did a lively atmosphere turn cold as soon as I arrived? This question weighed on my heart like a brick. I tossed and turned in bed at the company headquarters, listening to the soldiers' snores next door, and couldn't help but recall the days of battle and rolling with the soldiers. But now? As soon as I thought of this, I couldn't lie down anymore. I got up and opened Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "You want the masses to understand you, and you want to blend in with the masses, you must make a decision and go through long-term, even painful, tempering." Chairman Mao's words suddenly illuminated my heart. I thought, the soldiers not speaking out is a severe criticism of me through their actions, indicating that I was detached from the masses in the past and am not truly close to the masses now. What's the reason? It's this wall in front of me. Although it's a physical wall, it's more of an invisible wall in my thoughts. I decided to break down this wall and truly go among the masses.

	The next morning, I moved my backpack to the second platoon. The soldiers were especially happy to see me, some helped me spread the bed, and some chatted with me. In the morning exercises, I ran in front; during labor and training, I crawled and rolled with the soldiers; in meetings and studies, I discussed and spoke with the soldiers as seriously as they did. After living among the masses for a while, the soldiers confided in me: "In the past, you always walked with your chest puffed out and scolded people with your eyes wide open, it was scary. Now you've come among us, you've changed, and there's nothing to be afraid of." This made me realize that a leading cadre can only truly blend in with the masses, have common thoughts, feelings, language, and actions with the masses, and humbly learn from the masses when they break down their own mental walls and truly go among the masses.

	After a while, I found that although the soldiers were no longer restrained with me, they rarely gave me criticism. What was the reason? I went to talk with the old soldier Wang Jinshan. Wang Jinshan's words opened my mind. He said: "Chairman Mao teaches us, without investigation, there is no right to speak. We don't understand your thoughts, how can we criticize you randomly?" That's right! I came to the company, only paying attention to the "four together" in life, without sharing my thoughts with the masses. How could the soldiers criticize my thoughts? Therefore, I decided to share my thoughts with the soldiers. After that, wherever I went, I shared my thoughts there, and I specially prepared a notebook to record everyone's opinions and the quotations from Chairman Mao's works that helped me, one by one, to promote my ideological revolution. After doing this, the soldiers included me in their platoon in their minds, using the standard of a revolutionary soldier to strictly demand of me, helping me to achieve ideological revolution just as they would help a comrade-in-arms overcome shortcomings.

	Welcoming the "high-temperature fire," frequently asking the masses for criticism

	After going among the masses, another problem I encountered was how to correctly handle criticism from the masses.

	At first, I was not used to the "high-temperature fire" of the masses' criticism and saw the masses' criticism as "attacking" myself. Once, I went to the training ground with the soldiers for training. During a rest, I asked for opinions on the training. Unexpectedly, the new soldier Zhang Wangan fired a shot at me: "Plans are made in the office, but they can't be implemented on the training ground." This sudden shot made my face flush and sweat pour down. I thought: You, who have only been a soldier for a few days, have seen so little of the world. I have fought more battles than you have heard stories. But after calming down, I thought, Zhang Wangan fired a shot, maybe the training plan has a problem. After investigation, the original plan did not suit the soldiers' actual situation. Whether they were new or old soldiers, regardless of their technical level, they all trained in the same subject, resulting in the old soldiers being "not full" and the new soldiers being "unable to handle it." Zhang Wangan's opinion was correct. Thus, the plan was revised according to the masses' opinions.

	The matter was resolved, but my mind was in turmoil. Why did I not seriously check when the soldiers gave me criticism but instead felt unable to bear it and wanted to get angry? I found the answer in Chairman Mao's works with this question. Chairman Mao said: "Because we serve the people, we should not fear others pointing out our shortcomings. Whoever points out our shortcomings is fine." Chairman Mao clearly pointed out here that whether or not one can accept the masses' criticism is a measure of whether one is wholeheartedly serving the people or half-heartedly serving the people. In listening to Zhang Wangan's criticism, I was not acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings. In my mind, there was a line that I was the commander and he was a soldier, I could only scold him, he could not "scold" me. When the soldiers gave me criticism, I always felt it infringed on my "dignity" and swept my "official face."

	Originally, I was also a cadre promoted from the soldiers, why did the spirit of an ordinary soldier change so quickly? I recalled the situation of participating in the revolution for more than twenty years. In the past, during the war-torn years, I was always rolling with the soldiers, with only "serving the people" in my mind and no distinction between "official" and "soldier." Some "cannon" soldiers gave our company cadres direct criticism. The cadres did not pick on the attitude of criticism, feeling that comrades' criticism was heartfelt and every word was sincere. They treated the soldiers as the most enthusiastic and responsible good teachers in helping them with ideological revolution. After becoming a regimental cadre, I did not continuously use Mao Zedong Thought to reform myself, received less criticism from others, and criticized others more. Over time, listening to criticism from below became unpleasant.

	Through study, I realized: welcoming or opposing the masses' criticism is a fundamental dividing line between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview. Proletarian revolutionaries, no matter how high their position, are all servants of the people and should believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and welcome the masses' criticism. Those with a bourgeois worldview do not believe in the masses, fear the masses, fear the masses' criticism, and see the masses who dare to criticize as "opponents" who are "attacking" them. I could not accept the soldiers' criticism because the root cause was that my worldview had not been reformed. To fundamentally cure this problem, I must place myself among the masses, frequently ask the masses to "scold" me, and ignite a vast fire of criticizing selfishness and establishing public spirit in my journey of ideological revolution, burning away officialdom and the remnants of bourgeois ideology deep in my soul, and humbly be a good ordinary soldier.

　　恭恭敬敬做群众的小学生
　　荣立三次一等战功、人民解放军某部团长　李明友
    编者按：毛主席最近指示军队办学习班要有战士参加，是从教育着手解决干部问题、搞好干群关系的一个重大措施。这就是教导我们广大的革命干部，要永远同群众在一起，恭恭敬敬地做群众的小学生，从群众那里接受教育，得到帮助，不断地促进自己的思想革命化，把革命工作做得更好。李明友同志的亲身体会，很好地说明了这个问题。
    在战火纷飞的年月里，李明友和战士一起冲杀滚爬，结下了深厚的战斗友谊。但是，他在立了几次战功以后，有了点名气，“官”做大了，就摆起“架子”，和战士越来越疏远，如同隔了一道墙。
    身隔群众一道墙，心隔群众一座山。干部如果脱离群众，就不能爱群众所爱，恨群众所恨，急群众所急，就不能和群众心连心，发展下去，就有可能背离毛主席的革命路线，走到邪路上去。
    因此，我们所有的革命干部，都应当永远牢记毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”，要永远永远做毛主席的小学生，永远永远做群众的小学生，经常到群众中去，虚心向群众学习，诚恳地接受群众的批评和监督。这样，“只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”
    毛主席最近教导我们：“军队办学习班要有战士参加”，“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”毛主席的这个指示太重要了。联系实际情况来看，干部犯错误，往往是从脱离群众开始的；要改正错误，首先必须回到群众里面去，虚心听取群众的意见，接受群众的批评和帮助，从根本上树立群众观点。这也是一场深刻的思想革命，是一个斗私批修的过程。下面谈谈我到群众里面去，和群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观，促进思想革命化的几点体会。
　　有了“官架子”，就要脱离群众
    以前，我也常下连队，那是去检查工作，教育别人。带着“官架子”下去，心里就没有群众，眼里就光看缺点，嘴里就只有我说你听。有一次，我坐着小汽车到三连生产点去检查春播情况。一下车，看见战士们没按我规定的春播计划执行，气就来了，立刻把指导员李国钧叫过来，不问青红皂白地“训”了一顿。战士们背地议论说：“南方的‘官’儿管北方的事，种地也得立新规章，真厉害！”事后，我才知道自己订的那个春播计划，不适合东北的气候条件。指导员李国钧和多数战士都是东北人，最懂得什么时候种什么，怎么种。我没有虚心向他们学习，还拉着架子“训斥”他们。这个教训象棒子一样狠狠地敲了我一下子。
    我想：近几年，为啥自己与战士的距离越拉越远了呢？这个问题一提出来，自己当连长，当营长时的情景就浮现在眼前。那时，生活在战士中间，遇事和战士一起商量，打仗和战士一起制订作战方案，遇到难关就和战士一起琢磨点子攻破它。可是，当打了几个胜仗，立了几次一等功，名声出去了，我错误地认为“有两套”了，就不大想当战士的小学生。后来，我当上了团干部，更觉得自己是个了不起的“官”了。就这样，大部分时间，我坐在大楼里，批文件，听电话，和战士隔绝起来。
    回想起这一切，我不禁大吃一惊。毛主席早就告诫我们：“只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。如果把自己看作群众的主人，看作高踞于‘下等人’头上的贵族，那末，不管他们有多大的才能，也是群众所不需要的，他们的工作是没有前途的。”这使我深刻地认识到：我跟战士一近一远的变化，不只是职务的变化，而更重要的是我的思想感情在变。党和人民把我放在领导岗位上，这是对我的信任，理应保持普通一兵的本色，可是我反而把它当成包袱背。我严重地脱离了群众，背离了毛主席的教导，这是多么危险啊！
　　打通隔绝群众的“墙”，做群众的小学生
    这个变化是以“私”为核心的变化，是脱离群众突出个人的开始。有些人变成修正主义分子，不也是往往从脱离群众、做官当老爷开始的吗？我一想到这里，不寒而栗。我就痛下决心，到群众里去狠斗“私”字，狠批“修”字。于是，我背上背包，到一连去了。
    到了一连，我本想住到二排去，连里的干部却拉着我，关切地说：“团长，还是住在连部吧！排里人多，休息不好；这里跟二排只隔一道墙。”当时，我也觉得自己年龄大了，又有高血压病，住在连部离战士也不远。可是，当我晚上到班里排里去参加学习讨论时，我走到那个班，那个班的讨论就“卡壳”。我虽然一个劲的解释，可是大家还不敢大胆发言。有的鼓起勇气来说两句，也是先来个开场白：“我没想好，有什么不对的地方请团长指正。”为什么一个热烈的场面，我一来就冷场了呢？这个问题象一块土坯压在我心上。我躺在连部的床上翻来复去睡不着，听听隔壁战士们的酣声，不觉又回忆起那战斗的年月和战士滚爬在一起的情形。可现在呢？一想到这里，我再也躺不住了，一骨碌爬起来打开毛主席著作。毛主席说：“你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”毛主席的话一下子照亮了我的心。我想，战士不发言，这是用行动对我提出了严厉批评，既说明我过去脱离了群众，又说明我现在虽然到了连队，还没有真正接近群众。什么原因呢？就是眼前的这道墙，这虽然是一道有形的墙，可更是一道无形的思想上的“墙”。我决心打通这道“墙”，真正走到群众里面去。
    第二天一早，我就搬着背包到二排去了。战士们见了格外高兴，有的帮我铺被子，有的跟我拉家常。早晨出操，我跑在前面；劳动、训练，我和战士爬在一起，滚在一起；开会学习，我和战士们一样认真地讨论发言。在群众中生活了一段时间后，战士们跟我交心时说：“过去见你总是挺着胸脯走路，瞪着眼睛训人，怪怕的。现在你走到我们中间来了，人也变了，也没啥可怕的了。”这使我体会到，一个领导干部，只有打通自己思想上的“墙”，真正走到群众里面去，和群众在一起，群众才会真正了解你，收下你当小学生。你才会真正同群众有共同的思想，共同的感情，共同的语言，共同的行动，才会老老实实、恭恭敬敬地向群众学习。
    过了一段时间，我又发现战士们和我在一起虽然不拘束了，可很少给我提出批评意见。这是什么原因呢？我去找老战士王金山谈心。王金山一句话剖开了我的闷葫芦。他说：“毛主席教导我们，没有调查就没有发言权。我们不了解你的思想，怎么能乱放炮呢？”对呀！我来到连队光注意生活上“五同”，没有把思想交给群众，战士们怎么能向我的思想开刀呢？于是，我决心和战士一同亮思想。以后，我走到那里，就把思想亮到那里，还专门准备了个本子，把大家的意见和帮我选得的毛主席语录，一条一条记下来，促进自己的思想革命化。我这样做了以后，战士们从思想上把我编入了排，以一个革命战士的标准严格要求我，象帮助战友克服缺点一样，帮助我实现思想革命化。
　　欢迎“高温烈火”，经常请群众批评
    到群众中去以后，遇到的另一个问题，就是正确对待来自群众的批评。
    开初，我对群众批评的“高温烈火”很不习惯，把群众的批评看成是“整”自己。有一次，我去预习场和战士们一起训练。休息时，我征求同志们对训练的意见。没想到，新战士张万庚冲着我就放了炮：“坐在办公室里订计划，在训练场上落不了实。”这劈头盖脑的一炮，轰得我的脸直发烧，身上直冒汗。我想：你这个当兵才几天的年轻娃娃，见了多少世面，我打的仗比你听的故事都多哩。但冷静一想，张万庚既放了一炮，可能训练计划有问题。经过了解，原来的计划，不符合战士的实际。不管是新战士还是老战士，也不问技术水平高低，都共练一个课目，结果是老的
  “吃不饱”，新的“吃不了”。张万庚的意见正确。于是就按照群众的意见，重新修订了计划。
    事情处理了，可我脑子里却翻腾开了。为什么战士给我提出批评意见，不去作认真检查，反而感到吃不住劲，想发火呢？我带着这个问题从毛主席著作中找到了答案。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。”毛主席在这里明确地指出，听不听得进群众的批评，是衡量一个人是全心全意为人民服务，还是半心半意为人民服务的标志。我在听取张万庚的批评上，就不是按照毛主席的教导办事的。在脑子里有这么一条杠杠，认为我是团长，你是兵，我只能训你，你不能“训”我。战士给我提批评意见，总觉得触犯了我的“尊严”，扫了我的“官面子”。
    本来我也是从战士提起来的干部，普通一兵的本色为啥变得这么快呢？我回想起参加革命二十多年的情况。过去，在烽火连天的战争年代里，我成天和战士滚在一起，思想上只有“为人民服务”，没有“官”呀“兵”呀这个界限。一些“炮筒子”战士，给我们连里干部提意见，直来直去。干部从不挑剔提意见的态度，感到同志们的批评处处知心，字字知情，把战士们当作帮助自己思想革命化最热心、最负责的好教师。当了团干部以后，没有不断地用毛泽东思想改造自己，受别人的“训”少了，训别人多了，天长日久，再听下面的批评，就不顺耳了。
    通过学习，我认识到：欢迎还是反对群众的批评，是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的一个根本分界线。无产阶级革命者不论职位多高，都是人民勤务员，都应该相信群众，依靠群众，欢迎群众的批评。满脑子资产阶级世界观的人不相信群众，害怕群众，害怕群众的批评，把敢于批评的群众看成是“整”自己的“反对派”。我听不进战士的批评，根子还是世界观没改造好。要想根治这个毛病，只有把自己置身于群众之中，经常请群众“训”自己，在自己思想革命化的征途上烧起破私立公的漫天大火，烧掉官气，烧掉灵魂深处的资产阶级的残渣余孽，老老实实当好普通一兵。
