The first session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, which primarily involved cadres and included soldiers from the People's Liberation Army and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, has recently concluded. This session of the study class has achieved significant results in addressing cadre issues.

Chairman Mao said: "Correctly handling cadre issues is the key to implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the great alliance of revolution, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. This issue must be resolved." The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, based on Chairman Mao's great teachings, decided to focus on addressing cadre issues in the first session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class. The specific approach was to intensively study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Three Articles," intensively conduct education on the revolutionary situation and class struggle, and take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle. The aim was to help cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations grasp Mao Zedong Thought, educate themselves, and liberate themselves. The focus was on solving one "correct understanding" and three "correct attitudes": deeply understanding the great historical significance of the Cultural Revolution and correctly recognizing the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution; correctly treating the masses and mass movements; correctly treating cadres; and correctly treating oneself.

The leadership group of the study class, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on grasping the main contradiction, analyzed the current situation. After the start of the study class, the first priority was to intensively conduct education on the revolutionary situation.

Chairman Mao said: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before. The important sign of the excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. Never before has a mass movement been so widespread and deep. The cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations who participated in the study class studied and understood Chairman Mao's instructions word by word, learning Chairman Mao's stance and methods for analyzing the situation. They understood that the key to observing the situation is to look at the direction of the masses. Many cadres said: Observing the situation with a 'selfish' and 'resentful' attitude will lead to confusion between the main and the secondary, the phenomenon and the essence, and the part and the whole. With the help of the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, they struggled against selfishness and criticized revisionism, deeply realizing that how to observe the situation is not just a matter of method, but also a matter of stance. It is a question of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, everyone enthusiastically discussed the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution and the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The more they discussed, the clearer their minds became, the stronger their confidence grew, and the more they loved the great leader Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

After correctly understanding the situation, the cadres reviewed Chairman Mao's series of teachings on the mass line, such as "The people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history," and felt particularly close to them, finding each word to be the truth. They examined their wrong attitudes towards the masses and mass movements during the movement, recognizing that the attitude towards the masses and mass movements is the dividing line between two worldviews and the focal point of the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line. They all enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the revolutionary masses in high-spiritedly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely following the great leader Chairman Mao, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Especially after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the relationship between superiors and subordinates and the relationship between cadres and the masses, they were greatly shocked. Everyone used the "Old Three Articles" as a weapon, took the shining examples of Zhang Zedong, White Agnes, and the Old Foolish Man, and compared and examined themselves, expressing their determination to both regard themselves as a force for the revolution and to constantly regard themselves as an object of the revolution. They said: We must learn from Comrade Year Four Wang, who had a revolutionary explosion in his mind, and use Mao Zedong Thought to seize power from the bourgeois command headquarters in our minds, thoroughly struggle against and expose the core of bourgeois ideology, the "selfish" character, thoroughly reform our worldview, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. We will follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, struggle against selfishness for life, and reform for life.

The leaders of revolutionary mass organizations who participated in the study class, after correctly understanding the excellent situation through the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, realized that the fundamental contradiction that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, aims to solve is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, and between the two roads. It is to ensure that our socialist motherland will never change color. Many leaders of mass organizations, in light of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, fiercely criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique" advocated by Liu Shaoqi, and fiercely struggled against their own "selfish" character and factionalism in cadre issues. Over the past month, they lived and studied together with the cadres, helping and understanding each other, seeing that many cadres had a history of blood and tears and had done a lot of work for the revolution over the past ten or twenty years. Therefore, they naturally developed class feelings for revolutionary cadres, and the chasm formed by the bourgeois reactionary line between cadres and the masses was filled. They decided to high-spiritedly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, definitely solve the cadre issue, resolutely liberate revolutionary cadres, boldly use revolutionary cadres, and form a "three-in-one combination" leadership team with revolutionary leading cadres. Together with all revolutionary cadres, they will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The remarkable results achieved by the first session of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee's Mao Zedong Thought study class in correctly addressing cadre issues have created good conditions for further developing and consolidating the great alliance of revolution and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in Beijing, and for doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit.

　　北京市革委会第一期毛泽东思想学习班取得显著成效
　　大学毛主席指示　狠抓革命形势教育
    以斗私批修为纲　正确解决干部问题
    据新华社十五日讯　北京市革命委员会举办的第一期以干部为主、有解放军同志和革命群众组织负责人参加的三结合的毛泽东思想学习班，已经在最近结束。这一期学习班，在解决干部问题方面取得了显著效果。
    毛主席说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”北京市革命委员会根据毛主席的这个伟大教导，确定在第一期毛泽东思想学习班里，着重解决干部问题。具体做法是：狠抓毛主席最新指示和“老三篇”的学习，狠抓形势教育和阶级教育，以“斗私，批修”为纲，帮助干部和革命群众组织负责人掌握毛泽东思想，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，着重解决一个“正确认识”和三个“正确对待”的问题，这就是：深刻理解文化大革命的伟大历史意义和正确认识文化大革命的大好形势；正确对待群众和群众运动；正确对待干部；正确对待自己。
    学习班领导小组根据毛主席抓主要矛盾的教导，分析了当前的形势，学习班开学以后，首先狠抓了形势教育。
    毛主席说：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”参加学习的干部和革命群众组织负责人，逐字逐句地学习、领会毛主席的指示，从中学习毛主席分析形势的立场和方法，懂得了看形势主要是看群众的动向。许多干部说：带着“私”字、“怨”字看形势，就会本末倒置，以支流当主流，现象当本质，把局部扩大为全局。他们在革命群众组织负责人的帮助下斗私批修，深刻地认识到怎样看形势，这不仅是方法问题，也是立场问题，是忠不忠于毛主席、忠不忠于毛泽东思想、忠不忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的问题。于是，大家纷纷大摆文化大革命的大好形势，大摆毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，越摆心里越亮，越摆信心越强，越摆越热爱伟大领袖毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱毛主席的革命路线。
    对形势有了正确的认识以后，干部们重温毛主席“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”等一系列关于群众路线的教导，都感到格外亲切，字字是真理。他们检查了在运动中对待群众和群众运动的错误态度，认识到对待群众和群众运动的态度问题，是两种世界观的分水岭，是毛主席革命路线和资产阶级反动路线斗争的焦点。他们都以敬佩的心情，热烈赞扬广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，在无产阶级文化大革命中建立的伟大功勋。特别当他们学习了毛主席关于上下级关系和干群关系的最新指示以后，震动很大。大家用“老三篇”做武器，以张思德、白求恩、老愚公的光辉形象为榜样，对照检查自己，纷纷表示既要把自己当作革命的一份力量，又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。他们说：我们要学习年四旺同志，在思想深处爆发革命，用毛泽东思想向头脑中的资产阶级司令部进行夺权斗争，把资产阶级思想的核心“私”字彻底斗倒斗臭，彻底改造世界观，大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，跟毛主席闹一辈子革命，斗一辈子私，改造一辈子。
    参加学习的革命群众组织负责人，通过对毛主席最新指示的学习，正确地认识了大好形势以后，认识到毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的根本矛盾，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾，是为了使我们的社会主义祖国永不变颜色。许多群众组织的负责人对照毛主席最新指示中关于干部问题的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫制定和推行的在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，狠斗了自己在干部问题上的“私”字和派性。一个月来，他们同干部一起生活，一起学习，互相帮助，互相了解，看到许多干部都有一部血泪的家史，在过去十几年、几十年里对革命都做过不少的工作。因此，他们很自然地对革命干部产生了阶级感情，资产阶级反动路线在干部和群众之间形成的鸿沟填平了。他们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，破私立公，坚决贯彻毛主席的干部政策，一定把干部问题解决好，坚决解放革命干部，大胆使用革命干部，和革命领导干部搞好“三结合”的领导班子，和广大革命干部一起把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    北京市革命委员会第一期毛泽东思想学习班，在正确解决干部问题方面所取得的显著效果，为北京市进一步发展和巩固革命大联合、革命三结合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，创造了良好条件。
