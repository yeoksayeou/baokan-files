Revolutionary workers in Shanghai's printing system, with their profound class feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have completed this glorious political task after hundreds of experiments.

A giant colored plastic portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao has been successfully trial-produced in Shanghai. This is another achievement by the revolutionary workers in Shanghai's printing system after they successfully completed the glorious task of mass-printing the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" this year.

The giant colored plastic portrait of Chairman Mao is 2.5 meters high and 2 meters wide. Its surface is coated with a layer of plastic, making it smooth and transparent, and it is not easily affected by moisture or fading under various climatic conditions. This type of giant portrait is suitable for display in streets, meeting halls, factories, rural areas, and military units.

Revolutionary workers from Shanghai Printing Factory No. 9 and more than 100 cooperative units across the city participated in the trial production. With boundless love for Chairman Mao, they worked tirelessly, day and night, overcoming one difficulty after another in the trial production process. After hundreds of experiments, they finally produced the giant colored plastic portrait of Chairman Mao that the revolutionary people have long been hoping for.
