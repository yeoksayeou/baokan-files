During the rainy season, the southern region of South Vietnam, the Dong Tam Plain, is submerged by heavy rains and overflowing rivers, leaving only dense forests protruding from the water surface like large and small islands.

On the morning of September 11th, as the sun began to rise above the water, residents from the communes of Thong Tay, Thong Loc, and Thong Phu in Dong Tam District set out from their villages in small wooden boats and light bamboo rafts, heading to deep waters to fish.

Everyone was working diligently when they suddenly heard the sound of enemy speedboats approaching from the direction of the enemy's base in Dong Tam. Everyone quickly and alertly retracted their fishing nets and rods, and picked up their weapons. In an instant, all the small boats and rafts disappeared into the thickets. The water surface was calm, except for the growing roar of the enemy speedboats.

Soon, six enemy speedboats appeared. The enemies on board, fearing an ambush by the guerrilla forces, fired their guns and cannons indiscriminately to boost their own morale. However, they had already fallen into the guerrilla forces' ambush, and none of them could escape.

Many small boats and bamboo rafts emerged from the thickets on both sides like two sharp swords, blocking the enemy's path with fierce gunfire. The engine of the enemy's first speedboat was immediately destroyed, causing it to spin wildly on the water surface. The enemies on board fell into the water one by one. The remaining five speedboats, seeing the dire situation, quickly turned around to flee.

However, the guerrilla forces' small boats and bamboo rafts, like sharp arrows, emerged from all directions to encircle the enemy. The guerrilla fighters fired fiercely at the enemy boats, causing the enemies to stumble and fall, jumping into the water to escape.

In a short while, the guerrilla forces had sunk two of the enemy's speedboats. The remaining three speedboats, seeing that escape was impossible, immediately raised their hands in surrender.

    水上歼灭战
    同塔梅地区水上游击队的一支凯歌
    在雨季的时候，越南南方南部地区的同塔梅平原被暴雨和泛滥的河水淹没了，只有一片片茂密的丛林露在水面上，象一个个大大小小的岛屿一样。
    九月十一日清晨，当太阳刚刚露出水面的时候，洪御县常泰、常乐和常福乡的居民从各个村子里摇着小木船和划着轻捷的竹艇，汇集到深水地区去捕鱼。
    大家正在紧张劳动的时候，突然听到从美伪军版都基地的方向传来了汽艇的马达声。于是，大家机警地收起渔网，放好钓杆，拿起了杀敌的武器。不一会，所有的小木船和竹艇都消失在树丛里了。水面上一片静寂，只有敌人汽艇的马达响声越来越大。
    过不久，敌人的六艘汽艇开过来了。艇上的敌人害怕遭到游击队的伏击，不断胡乱打枪打炮，给自己壮胆。但是，他们已经落进了游击队的伏击圈，一个都逃不脱了。
    许多的小木船和竹艇从两边的丛林中象两把利剑一样插出来，以猛烈的火力堵住了敌人。敌人第一艘汽艇的发动机立刻被打坏了，歪歪斜斜地在水面上打起旋转来，艇上的敌人一个个都掉进了水中。后面的五艘汽艇一看情况不妙，急着掉过头来逃跑。
    但是游击队的小木船和竹艇象一支支利箭，从四面八方杀出来包围了敌人。游击队员们以猛烈火力射向敌艇，打得敌人东倒西歪，纷纷跳水逃命。
    不一会，游击队就击沉了敌人的两艘汽艇，另外三艘汽艇上的残敌眼看已经逃不脱，立刻举起手来投降了。（附图片）
