	How to Overthrow the "Private" Self, Eliminate Barriers, and Achieve Revolutionary Great Unity?
	Follow Chairman Mao's Teachings and Engage in Self-Criticism
	Workers of Guangzhou Yonghong Pharmaceutical Factory Learn from Chairman Mao's Instructions and See Immediate Results

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 22 - The revolutionary workers of Guangzhou Yonghong Pharmaceutical Factory, during the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have been vigorously promoting active learning and application, integrating learning with practice, and seeing immediate results. This fundamental attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought has led to a revolution in the depths of their souls, effectively promoting the realization of revolutionary great unity within the factory, divided by workshops and teams, and achieving victories in both revolution and production.

	During the Cultural Revolution, the workers of Yonghong Pharmaceutical Factory, influenced by the instigation of the capitalist-roaders within the Party, were divided into two major factions. With the help of the PLA's Mao Zedong Thought propagandists stationed in the factory, the two factions discussed and negotiated the issue of achieving great unity, but due to factionalism, several meetings ended in failure. At this critical moment, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism," and Comrade Lin Biao, in his National Day speech, instructed to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively. This greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of the entire factory, and everyone actively requested to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the factory. However, due to the persistence of factionalism, the two factions blamed each other in small group meetings and rarely engaged in self-criticism, making it difficult to continue learning. The PLA propagandists, after analysis, believed that this was mainly due to the "private" self. To overcome the "private" self, one must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and engage in self-criticism. Leave the shortcomings and errors of others to them to address. They then encouraged everyone to focus on self-criticism. The PLA propagandists also took the lead in criticizing their own shortcomings and errors in studying, conveying, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and in promoting the great unity of the two factions. Everyone was deeply moved. The leaders of the two factions also made some self-criticisms, and the tense atmosphere of confrontation began to ease.

	However, regarding how to achieve great unity, both sides had their own plans based on factionalism. Later, through the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, everyone further realized that their own thoughts were not correctly addressing themselves, correctly addressing the masses, and lacked a spirit of understanding the bigger picture and considering the overall situation.

	Although the two factions' understanding of achieving revolutionary great unity had improved, there were still various thoughts on whether to openly reveal their private thoughts and engage in self-criticism in the presence of the other side in the Mao Zedong Thought study groups. Some people thought that self-criticism in front of the other side would give the other side a "handle" to grab, a "straw" to clutch, fearing that after exposing their shortcomings and errors, they would lose authority and the support and endorsement of the masses, and lose their "advantage" in the great unity. Others advocated waiting for the other side to speak first, matching the level of self-criticism with the other side, or speaking some but holding back. Because these ideological obstacles were not resolved, whenever the issue of great unity was discussed, the two factions were wary of each other, and their feelings could not be united.

	How to solve these ideological problems? The PLA propagandists, after careful analysis, believed that it was necessary to address the attitude towards Chairman Mao's instructions and Mao Zedong Thought. This is the most fundamental link to solving all problems. They then guided everyone to study Chairman Mao's works repeatedly. Chairman Mao said, "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be proficient in it and apply it; the purpose of proficiency is entirely for application." Through repeated study, everyone's awareness was further raised, realizing that whether Chairman Mao's instructions were studied and implemented sincerely, whether learning and application were integrated, and whether one dared to reveal and fight against private thoughts in the great unity according to Chairman Mao's teachings, were major issues of loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. One must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, engage in self-criticism, and spark a revolution in the depths of one's soul to solve all ideological problems. Everyone expressed their determination to firmly and unconditionally follow Mao Zedong Thought, doing as Chairman Mao says, without hesitation or wavering. At the same time, under the guidance and help of the PLA propagandists, the leaders of the two factions sincerely criticized their various shortcomings and errors since the Cultural Revolution at a full factory workers' meeting, openly revealing their private thoughts and engaging in self-criticism. The broad masses of the two factions were deeply moved, believing that only in this way could one truly follow Mao Zedong Thought and truly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Some people who had previously had strong oppositional sentiments, after hearing the other side's sincere self-criticism, were moved to tears, spontaneously shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" Many also took the initiative to engage in self-criticism in front of the other side. In this way, the oppositional sentiments of the two factions gradually dissipated, and the long-standing ideological knots were untied. Now, the entire factory has established a revolutionary great unity committee based on the realization of revolutionary great unity by workshops and teams.

	After achieving revolutionary great unity, the workers' spiritual outlook has been completely renewed. They are vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously advancing production. In November, the entire factory's production plan was completed three days ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota.

    怎样才能斗倒私字，消除隔阂，实现革命大联合？
    按照毛主席教导多做自我批评
    广州永红制药厂革命职工学习毛主席指示立竿见影
    据新华社广州二十二日电　广州永红制药厂的革命职工在学习毛主席最新指示过程中狠抓活学活用，学用结合，立竿见影这个对待毛泽东思想的根本态度问题，在毛泽东思想学习班上多做自我批评，狠斗各种私心杂念，在灵魂深处爆发革命，有力地促进全厂按车间、按班组实现了革命的大联合，获得了革命、生产双胜利。
    永红制药厂的革命职工在文化大革命中，由于受党内走资本主义道路当权派的挑拨，分裂成为两大派组织。在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传员的帮助下，两派的革命职工酝酿协商实现大联合问题，但是因为派性作怪，开了几次座谈会都不欢而散。正在这时，伟大领袖毛主席发出了“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，林彪同志在国庆节讲话中指示要大办毛泽东思想学习班，使全厂革命职工受到极大的鼓舞，大家积极要求在厂里开办毛泽东思想学习班。但是，因为派性没有消除，两派在小组会上互相指责，很少检查自己，学不下去。驻厂的毛泽东思想宣传员经过分析，认为这主要是“私”字作怪。要斗倒“私”字，必须按照毛主席的教导，多做自我批评。别人的缺点、错误，留给别人自己去讲。于是启发大家多检查自己，解放军宣传员还带头检查自己在学习、传达、贯彻毛主席最新指示，在促进两派大联合工作中的一些缺点、错误。大家很受感动。两派的头头跟着也作了一些自我批评，紧张的对立空气有了缓和。
    但是，对怎样实现大联合，双方从派性出发，各有打算。后来，大家通过活学活用毛主席著作，又进一步认识到，自己的想法是没有正确地对待自己、正确地对待群众和缺乏识大体、顾大局的精神。
    两派对实现革命大联合的认识虽然又提高了一步，但是对要不要在毛泽东思想学习小组里当着对方的面亮出自己的私心和进行自我批评，大家又有各种各样的想法。有的人认为，在对方面前作自我批评，会被对方抓住“辫子”，捞到“稻草”，怕自我批评“暴露”了自己的缺点、错误后，会失去威信，丧失群众的支持和拥护，将来在大联合中失去“优势”。有的人则主张等别人先讲，对方讲到什么程度，自己也讲到什么程度，或者讲一些，留一手。因为这些思想障碍没有解决，所以一谈到大联合问题，两派就心存顾忌，互相戒备，感情始终捏不到一块。
    怎样才能解决大家的这些思想问题？解放军宣传员经过仔细分析，认为必须抓对待毛主席指示和毛泽东思想的态度问题。这是解决一切问题的最根本环节。于是又引导大家一遍又一遍地学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”经过反复学习，大家的觉悟又进一步提高了，认识到学了毛主席的指示是不是认真执行，学用结合，在大联合中敢不敢按毛主席的教导亮私斗私，多做自我批评，这是忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大问题。一定要活学活用毛主席著作，多做自我批评，在自己灵魂深处爆发革命，一切思想问题才能迎刃而解。大家都纷纷表示一定要坚定不移地、不折不扣地按照毛泽东思想办事，毛主席怎么说，自己就怎么做，不徘徊，不犹豫。在这同时，在解放军宣传员的带动和帮助下，两派头头在全厂职工大会上认真检查了文化大革命以来存在的种种缺点、错误，把自己思想深处的种种私心杂念和盘托出，诚恳地做了自我批评。两派的广大群众听了很受感动，认为只有这样，才是真正按照毛泽东思想办事，真正紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。一些过去对立情绪很严重的人，听了对方诚恳的自我批评后，感动得流下眼泪，情不自禁地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”不少人也主动在对方面前做自我批评。这样，两派的对立情绪逐渐消除，长期没有解开的思想疙瘩解开了。现在，全厂已在按车间、班组实现革命大联合的基础上，成立了全厂革命大联合委员会。
    实现革命大联合以后，职工精神面貌焕然一新。他们狠抓革命，猛促生产。十一月份，全厂生产计划提前三天超额完成。
