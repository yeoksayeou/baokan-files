With the personal care of our great leader Chairman Mao, and under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, after more than a year of intense and fierce struggle, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production situation in Jiangxi Province are better than ever. From the slopes of Jinggang Mountain to the banks of Poyang Lake, from cities to the countryside, the entire province is swept by a surging revolutionary tide and a thriving production atmosphere, with frequent reports of industrial and agricultural production achievements.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi, the working class, which played a decisive role, has achieved outstanding results in industrial production and transportation. Since the fourth quarter, the daily production level of the entire province has been rising steadily, and the output of many products has exceeded the level of the same period last year. Among them, coal production has increased particularly rapidly, with the daily production level of key coal mines such as Pingxiang and Fengcheng increasing by more than 68% compared to the previous quarter. The machinery industry has increased by 65% compared to the previous quarter, the light industry by 32%, the textile industry by 34%, and the steel industry has also seen significant growth. Railways, highways, and waterways throughout the province have universally launched a transportation high tide.

On the agricultural front, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in rural areas, after achieving a full increase in spring crops and a bumper harvest of early rice and summer grain, have again universally achieved good harvests of late rice and other autumn grain crops. The harvest of various cotton varieties is also very good. Oil crops, hemp, and other economic crops throughout the province have universally achieved a bumper harvest rarely seen in history. Other industries such as animal husbandry, forestry, and fisheries have also seen new developments.

Due to increased industrial production and bumper agricultural harvests, the market is bustling with activity, prices are stable, and the supply of goods is abundant and of high quality, presenting a prosperous scene everywhere.

“Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.” The dual victories of revolution and production achieved in Jiangxi are a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. The heroic people of Jinggang Mountain have deeply felt that following the great leader Chairman Mao means victory! They are eager to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works. With the highest enthusiasm, the greatest determination, and the fastest speed, they implement Chairman Mao’s every new instruction.

Under the guidance of the important instructions given by Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China, the revolutionary masses of Jiangxi Province quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. A large number of revolutionary cadres have stood out. From cities to the countryside, the broad revolutionary masses and cadres have launched a massive campaign of exposure, criticism, and struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his agents in this region. The great criticism, great unity, and three-in-one combination of the revolution have powerfully promoted the establishment of a new revolutionary order and the development of production.

After our great leader Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction to “fight selfishness and criticize revisionism,” the revolutionary masses of Jiangxi Province responded enthusiastically. They fiercely fight against selfishness, vigorously criticize revisionism, and carry out thorough ideological reform. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to achieve new and greater victories in revolution and production.

　　以最高热情最大决心最快速度贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示
　　江西省革命浪潮滚滚生产热气腾腾
    据新华社南昌十八日电　在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，经过一年多尖锐、激烈的斗争，江西省的无产阶级文化大革命和生产形势空前大好。从井冈山麓到鄱阳湖畔，从城市到农村，全省到处革命浪潮滚滚，生产热气腾腾，工农业生产捷报频传。
    在江西无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中起了决定性作用的工人阶级，在工业生产和交通运输战线上创造出出色的成绩。从第四季度以来，全省工业日产水平节节上升，不少产品产量超过了去年同期水平。其中煤炭产量上升尤其迅速，萍乡、丰城等几个重点煤矿的日产水平，比上一季度增长百分之六十八以上。机械工业较上一季度增长百分之六十五，轻化工业增长百分之三十二，纺织工业增长百分之三十四，钢铁工业也有了较大增长。全省铁路、公路、航运普遍掀起了运输高潮。
    在农业战线上，广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，在夺取了春熟作物全面增产，早稻和夏粮大丰收之后，又普遍夺得了晚稻等秋粮作物的好收成。各种良种棉的收成也很好。全省油料、麻类等经济作物，普遍获得了历史上少有的大丰收。其他如畜牧业、林业、渔业也都有新的发展。
    由于工业增产，农业丰收，物资丰富，城乡市场活跃，物价稳定，物资供应量多质好，到处是一片繁荣景象。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。江西省取得的革命和生产的双胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。英雄的井冈山儿女最深刻地体会到：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！他们如饥似渴地活学活用毛主席著作。他们以最高的热情，最大的决心，最快的速度，把毛主席的每一个最新指示落实到行动中去。
    在毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的重要指示的指引下，江西省无产阶级革命派很快实现了革命的大联合，一大批革命干部站了出来。全省从城市到农村，广大革命群众和革命干部，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区代理人，展开了声势浩大的大揭发、大批判、大斗争。革命的大批判、革命的大联合和革命的三结合，极为有力地促进了革命新秩序的建立和生产的发展。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的最新指示以后，江西省广大革命群众积极响应。他们狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义，大搞思想革命化。他们决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，夺取革命和生产的新的更大胜利。
