The issue of academic style is a matter of the leadership's, all cadres', and all Party members' approach to thinking. It is a matter of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. It is a matter of all Party members' work attitude. Since this is the case, the issue of academic style is a very important issue, it is the first important issue.

	Study Chairman Mao's Instructions, Link Them to Reality, and Implement Chairman Mao's Instructions with Immediate Effect

	The Mao Zedong Thought Study Class at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Has Been Effective

	Under the help of the PLA comrades, the study class has focused on the active thoughts of the participants, engaged in self-criticism and the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, helping cadres to free themselves from selfishness and stand up for revolution. This has further consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of the PLA stationed at the academy, has resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, they have organized large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have focused on the active thoughts of the cadres, helping them to free themselves from selfishness and stand up for revolution. This has further consolidated and developed the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, powerfully promoting the work of seizing the revolution, promoting production, and carrying out the struggle-criticism-transformation.

	In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most cadres at the academy had committed errors in implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. After the publication of the editorials in the third and fourth issues of the *Red Flag* magazine in 1967, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the academy conducted serious study and discussion. They realized that correctly handling cadres is a major principle of whether or not to implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. Therefore, they began to do some work with the cadres, and a part of the cadres stood up for revolution at this time. However, there were also some cadres who had been stuck in the small circle of selfishness for a long time and had not truly stood up for revolution.

	After the PLA entered the academy, they analyzed the ideological situation of these cadres together with the proletarian revolutionary faction of the academy. These cadres, in the early stages of the movement, had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressed revolutionary masses, and acted arrogantly. When the revolutionary masses rose up to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, they did not understand at first, and thus harbored three kinds of resentment: first, resentment. They felt that they had made mistakes "unwittingly" and were resentful towards the revolutionary masses criticizing them. Second, they were unwilling to admit their mistakes. They saw that the revolutionary youngsters and ordinary people who were not prominent before had become the most revolutionary, while they, who had worked for the revolution for many years, had become un-revolutionary. They were unwilling to admit their mistakes and had a strong sense of resistance towards the masses. Third, they were disheartened. They could not find the root cause of their mistakes and could not solve their ideological problems, and had the idea of waiting to be transferred away. The PLA comrades and the revolutionary faction analyzed these active thoughts of the cadres and believed that the root cause was that the "selfishness" in their minds was causing trouble. Because of the "selfishness" clouding their minds, they could not see the political significance of overthrowing and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. Therefore, the PLA comrades and the revolutionary faction decided to help these cadres fight against the "selfishness" in their minds, jump out of the small circle of selfishness, and liberate themselves.

	Chairman Mao's latest instruction, "to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," is the guiding light and powerful weapon for solving the problem of cadres. The revolutionary faction of the academy, following Chairman Mao's teachings, organized the cadres who had made mistakes into study classes under the guidance of the PLA comrades. With "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, they conducted large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They targeted the active thoughts that existed among the cadres and proposed the study requirements of "one big break, one big establishment, and three correct attitudes" (i.e., break away from the bourgeois worldview, establish the proletarian worldview; correctly handle oneself, correctly handle the masses, and correctly handle the mass movement) and the study methods of "one grasp and four froms" (i.e., grasp the class struggle as the key, find one's own problems from the struggle between the two lines, find answers from Chairman Mao's works, find the root cause from the depths of the soul, and see the effect from actions). They hit the target and treated the symptoms, helping the cadres to solve their ideological problems.

	At the beginning of the study, the PLA stationed at the academy and the proletarian revolutionary faction first organized the cadres to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles." Through the study, the thoughts of the majority of the cadres showed significant improvement. Chairman Mao said: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and exposure of our shortcomings. No matter who points out our shortcomings, we should welcome them. If what they say is correct, we should correct our mistakes." The cadres used Chairman Mao's teachings to measure themselves and realized that their resentment and resistance towards the masses' criticism were because they had not yet established the worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly, and the "selfishness" was still causing trouble in their minds. They said: "'Selfishness' is the ideological basis for the production of revisionism. If 'selfishness' is not overthrown, the root of revisionism cannot be uprooted, and the proletarian dictatorship cannot be consolidated." After their thoughts improved, they exposed their selfishness with boundless loyalty and love for Chairman Mao, struggled against "selfishness," and established "public-mindedness."

	Then, the PLA stationed at the academy and the proletarian revolutionary faction, with Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and Comrade Lin Biao's related speeches as weapons, raised the cadres' awareness of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and raised their class consciousness. Through the study, many cadres were shocked and deeply felt that in the past, because they had not seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, their class struggle consciousness had weakened, and they could not see the seriousness of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, they had fallen for the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and made mistakes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. From this, the majority of the cadres gradually understood the revolutionary mass movement, thought through the revolutionary mass movement, and were convinced by the revolutionary masses. They corrected their attitudes towards the masses and the mass movement and truly realized that "the masses are the real heroes," and the revolutionary mass movement is very good.

	The PLA stationed at the academy and the proletarian revolutionary faction also summarized many effective study methods in the study class. These methods powerfully helped the cadres to fight against the "selfishness" in their minds. The main methods they adopted were: (1) The method of mass self-education. This is to mobilize cadres to "braid their own hair" regarding their own problems, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and criticize themselves. At the end of the study, they summarized their own experiences, and the effect was very good. (2) Following Chairman Mao's teachings on solving different contradictions with different methods, they adopted the method of "tailoring to the individual, treating differently; actively helping, patiently waiting" to target the active thoughts of the cadres, treating the symptoms and doing the ideological work of the cadres patiently and carefully. When the cadres' thoughts fluctuated, they did not act simply and roughly or seek quick results. (3) Establishing "mutual aid groups" to carry out heart-to-heart talks. In the "mutual aid groups," the cadres, with the attitude of "learning from past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" and "being kind to others," carried out sincere self-criticism and mutual criticism, making everyone speak freely and feel at ease. Some cadres praised the "mutual aid groups" saying: "Mutual aid groups, mutual help; exchange selfishness, reveal the heart, establish new merits, have confidence." (4) Using typical examples, seizing the opportunity, holding lectures on the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, leading by example. During the study period, they held three lectures. The first one was at the critical moment of exposing selfishness. The second one was at the stage of further deepening the exposure of selfishness and raising awareness. The third one was the summary lecture of the study. The effect of the three lectures was very good.

	In the study class, the PLA stationed at the academy and the proletarian revolutionary faction focused on the education of the situation and class education, helping the cadres to correctly understand the unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, arousing the cadres' class feelings, greatly encouraging the cadres' revolutionary spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm, and raising the cadres' confidence and determination to stand up for revolution.

	Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the Chinese Academy of Sciences is very good. The cadres who returned from the study class actively sought out the masses to have heart-to-heart talks and checked their mistakes with the masses. The masses said to the cadres: "As soon as you came, we had no objections. We welcome you back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, standing up to make the revolution." Now, many cadres have been absorbed into the revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership group. Taking the Scientific Instrument Factory as an example, 95% of the cadres above the section level in the entire factory have stood up, including 29 cadres who have joined various levels of revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership groups, and 16 cadres who hold major responsibilities in these leadership groups. The revolutionary masses of the entire academy are, on the basis of the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination being increasingly consolidated, launching a high tide of struggle-criticism-transformation and seizing the revolution and promoting production.

### 中国科学院毛泽东思想学习班的效果好

    学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。					毛泽东
    学习毛主席指示联系实际　执行毛主席指示立竿见影
    中国科学院毛泽东思想学习班的效果好
    在解放军同志帮助下，学习班狠抓学员的活思想，斗私批修，进行自我批评，使干部从“私”字中解放出来，站起来革命，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命的三结合
    据新华社讯　中国科学院的无产阶级革命派，在驻院解放军的帮助下，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓干部的活思想，帮助干部从“私”字中解放出来，站起来革命，从而进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，有力地推动了抓革命、促生产和斗批改各项工作。
    无产阶级文化大革命初期，科学院的大多数干部都犯了执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。《红旗》杂志一九六七年第三、四期社论发表后，科学院的无产阶级革命派进行了认真的学习和讨论，认识到是不是正确对待干部是贯彻不贯彻毛主席干部政策的重大原则问题，因而开始做了一些干部工作，有一部分干部就在这个时候站出来革命了。但也有一些干部长期在“私”字的小圈子里打转转，一直没有真正站起来革命。
    驻院解放军进院之后，就和科学院的无产阶级革命派分析了这些干部的思想状况。这些干部在运动初期执行资产阶级反动路线，压制革命群众，盛气凌人。当革命群众起来大造资产阶级反动路线的反时，他们一时还不理解，因此产生了“三气”：一是怨气。他们觉得自己是“糊里糊涂犯了错误”的，对革命群众批判自己，怨气满肚。二是不服气。他们看到革命小将和平时不出名的普通群众变成了最革命的，而自己干了多年革命反而变成了不革命的，口服心不服，与群众闹对立，抵触情绪很大。三是泄气。他们找不到犯错误的根源，解决不了思想问题，有等待调走的想法。驻院解放军同志和无产阶级革命派分析了这些干部的活思想，认为归根结底是“私”字在这些干部头脑中作怪，因为“私”字迷了心窍，他们就看不清批倒批臭资产阶级反动路线的政治意义。因此解放军同志和革命派决心帮助这些干部向自己头脑里的“私”字开火，从“私”字的小圈子里跳出来，自己解放自己。
    毛主席的最新指示“要斗私，批修”是解决干部问题的指路明灯和有力武器。科学院的革命派遵照毛主席的教导，在解放军同志的帮助下，把犯了错误的干部组织起来，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班。他们针对干部普遍存在的活思想，在学习班上提出了“一个大破，一个大立，三个正确对待”（即大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观；正确对待自己，正确对待群众，正确对待群众运动）的学习要求和“一抓四从”（即抓住阶级斗争这个纲，从两条路线斗争中找自己的问题，从毛主席著作中找答案，从灵魂深处找根源，从行动中看效果）的学习方法，有的放矢，对症下药，帮助干部解决思想问题。
    学习一开始，驻院解放军和无产阶级革命派首先组织干部学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”，提高干部对“斗私，批修”伟大意义的认识。通过学习，绝大多数干部思想有了显著提高。毛主席说：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”干部们用毛主席的教导来衡量自己，认识到自己对群众的批判有抵触情绪、有怨气，就是因为自己还没有树立起全心全意为人民服务的世界观，“私”字还在自己头脑里作怪。他们说：“‘私’字是产生修正主义的思想基础，‘私’字不斗倒，修正主义的根子挖不掉，无产阶级江山保不牢。”认识提高之后，他们带着对毛主席无限忠诚和无限热爱的感情来亮私、斗私，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字。
    然后，驻院解放军和无产阶级革命派以毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导和林彪同志的有关讲话为武器，提高干部对两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的认识，提高他们的阶级觉悟。通过学习，很多干部大吃一惊，深深感到过去由于自己没有认真学习毛主席的著作，阶级斗争观念淡薄了，看不清在无产阶级专政条件下的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的严重性，因此，才上了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的当，在文化大革命中犯了错误。由此，绝大多数干部逐渐理解了革命的群众运动，对革命的群众运动想通了，对革命群众服气了，端正了对群众和群众运动的态度，真正认识到“群众是真正的英雄”，革命的群众运动好得很。
    驻院解放军和无产阶级革命派还在学习班上总结出了很多行之有效的学习方法。这些方法，有力地帮助了干部向自己头脑里的“私”字开火。他们采取的方法主要有：（一）、群众性自我教育的方法。这就是：发动干部对自己的问题自己“梳辫子”，带着这些问题活学活用毛主席著作，自己批判，学习结束时自己总结，效果很好。（二）、遵照毛主席关于不同的矛盾用不同的方法来解决的教导，针对干部的活思想，采取“因人制宜，区别对待；积极帮助，耐心等待”的方法，对症下药，耐心细致地做干部的思想工作，在干部的思想有反复时，也不简单粗暴和急于求成。（三）、建立“互助组”开展谈心活动。干部在“互助组”中本着“惩前毖后，治病救人”和“与人为善”的态度，开展诚恳的自我批评和相互批评，做到人人畅所欲言，心情舒畅。有的干部称赞“互助组”说：“互助组，互帮助；交私心，心见心，立新功，有信心。”（四）、运用典型，抓住火候，召开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，以点带面。学习期间，共开过三次讲用会，第一次是在亮私的关键时刻。第二次是在进一步深入亮私和提高认识阶段。第三次是学习总结讲用会。三次讲用会的效果都很好。
    在学习班中，驻院解放军和无产阶级革命派大抓形势教育和阶级教育，帮助干部正确认识无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，激发干部的阶级感情，大鼓干部的革命志气和革命干劲，提高了干部站出来革命的信心和决心。
    当前，中国科学院的无产阶级文化大革命的形势一片大好。从学习班回去的干部普遍主动地找群众谈心，向群众检讨错误。群众对干部说：“你们一来，我们就没有意见了。我们欢迎你们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，站出来干革命。”现在很多干部已被吸收参加了革命的三结合的领导班子。以科学仪器厂为例，全厂百分之九十五的科以上干部已经站了出来，其中有二十九名干部结合在各级革命三结合领导班子里，并有十六名干部在这些领导班子里负主要责任。全院革命群众，正在革命大联合和革命三结合日益巩固的基础上，掀起了斗批改和抓革命、促生产的高潮。
