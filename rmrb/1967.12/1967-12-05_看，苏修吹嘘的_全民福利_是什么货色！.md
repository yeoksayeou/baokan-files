Editor's Note: Around the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has been particularly eager to boast about "everything for the people, everything for the people's welfare." They attempt to paint the comprehensive restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union with a layer of "universal welfare."

The so-called "universal welfare" is just as much a lie as the "universal state." In a class society, there is no such thing as "welfare for everyone" or a class-transcending "universal welfare." There is bourgeois welfare, but there is no proletarian welfare. The proletariat only has everything when it has political power; without political power, there will never be happiness for the proletariat and the working people.

Under the rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, the state apparatus is in the hands of the bourgeois privileged stratum, implementing a thorough bourgeois dictatorship. There, the actions of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique are all based on the interests of the privileged stratum. The privileged stratum lives a life of decadence and corruption, while the vast majority of Soviet working people have once again fallen into a state of oppression, slavery, and exploitation. This is the true nature of the so-called "universal welfare."

The "universal welfare" propagated by Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like is not a new invention but is a piece of junk picked up from the imperialists. The American imperialists have also loudly boasted about the so-called "welfare state," using it to deceive the people and make the American people tighten their belts to make "special sacrifices" for the profits of the Wall Street bosses. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like sing about "universal welfare," but it is only to cover up their crimes of restoring capitalism, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, and intensifying the exploitation and oppression of the working people.

Look, what is the nature of the "universal welfare" boasted by the Soviet revisionists!

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, on the one hand, intensifies the exploitation and oppression of the vast majority of Soviet working people, and on the other hand, puts on a charitable act, boasting about a state of "universal welfare."

Fake is fake; the disguise should be stripped away. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's advocacy of "universal welfare" is only to cover up their evil deeds of the bourgeois privileged stratum oppressing and exploiting the working people.

The Soviet revisionist clique loudly proclaims the so-called "increase in workers' wages," but in reality, the increase in Soviet workers' wages is far from keeping up with the rise in prices.

According to statistics, from 1959 to 1965, the retail prices of fifteen major consumer goods in the Soviet Union, such as flour, cotton cloth, and leather shoes, increased by 42 percent. However, from 1959 to the end of 1964, workers' wages only increased by 18.9 percent.

In contrast to the situation of the broad masses of laborers, those bourgeois elements with titles like "academician," "factory director," and "manager" set high salaries for themselves. Some academicians earn as much as 6,500 rubles per month, while many workers only earn 60 to 70 rubles per month. The chief engineer of a plastic products factory "self-determined" a monthly salary of 1,400 rubles, while ordinary technical workers earn only 70 to 80 rubles per month.

"State-run" stores have a severe shortage of goods, and the prices of goods in free markets are exorbitant, which is a disaster for the vast majority of Soviet working people. Recently, even the *Soviet Trade News* had to admit that many customers are dissatisfied with not being able to buy "affordable" autumn and winter clothing, acknowledging that the shelves are filled with "expensive" clothing. This situation has caused widespread dissatisfaction among the people. Some workers say: "This is the worst time since the October Revolution; we are living a ghostly life."

The Soviet revisionist clique loudly proclaims the so-called "reduction" of workers' working hours and, on the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, loudly promotes the so-called "five-day workweek." The Soviet revisionist clique also claims that the "five-day workweek" is an important measure for "transitioning to communism" and "improving people's material welfare." But what is the reality?

The so-called "five-day workweek" has not shortened the originally stipulated working hours at all. The Soviet revisionist clique stipulates that the "necessary condition" for transitioning to a five-day workweek is to "ensure the completion of the total annual working hours during the six-day workweek."

Implementing the "five-day workweek" has also brought great difficulties to workers' lives. In factories that implement the "five-day workweek," the lunch break time for each shift is generally shortened to 20 to 30 minutes, and the night shift does not have any rest time in between, working continuously for 7 to 8 hours. For example, the 15th Bearing Factory in Volgograd originally had a one-hour lunch break, but now, the first shift works 8 hours with a 25-minute break; the second shift works 8 hours with a 20-minute break; the third shift works continuously for 7 hours and 15 minutes with no break in between. With 20 to 30 minutes of time, in a crowded and long-queued canteen, workers find it difficult to eat. Therefore, a worker at this factory, Nyerenko, angrily said: "What kind of five-day workweek is this?!" The *Labor News* revealed that after a textile factory implemented the "five-day workweek," female workers complained: "There is no time to eat lunch," "The line in the canteen is so long! We can't even drink a cup of tea."

The Soviet revisionist clique promotes the bourgeois economic law of "profit above all," bringing extremely serious consequences to the broad masses of working people.

According to the Soviet revisionist *Labor News*, the director of the Kirov Building Materials Combine, in pursuit of production quantity and profit, disregards the lives of workers. The working conditions in the factory are extremely poor: some workshops have "extremely high dust levels," some workshops have "coal gas content reaching dangerous levels," and the factory does not provide living hygiene facilities. The factory has repeatedly had serious work-related accidents, such as a fitter, Luban, being seriously injured by colliding with an unprotected rotating axle at night. The leaders of the Soviet agricultural machinery manufacturing industry, in pursuit of profit, produce shoddy products, and the quality of agricultural machinery is extremely poor. Therefore, "tractor rollover accidents frequently occur across the country, and many drivers are seriously injured." Although workers have criticized the "design flaws" of these machines, the factory, in pursuit of profit, ignores them and continues to produce in large quantities.

The Soviet press revealed that the leaders of the "Lenin" Coal Mine Company's Komsomol Coal Mine, in pursuit of bonuses, deliberately violate safety technical regulations. Since April of this year, the coal mine, in pursuit of overfulfilling the coal production quota, has not taken any preventive water spraying measures for the coal mining face. As a result, coal mine workers have long been working in coal dust. The ventilation supervisors, because they can get bonuses for overfulfilling the coal production quota, also do not intervene.

Several dozen workers in the Donetsk Coal Mine exposed that due to the use of high-efficiency combined coal mining machines and other equipment, the dust in the mine shaft has increased. "In many mine shafts, the dust concentration exceeds the allowable limit." The number of workers suffering from silicosis and work-related accidents is increasing.

### 看，苏修吹嘘的“全民福利”是什么货色！

专栏：看苏修怎样在国内复辟资本主义

    编者按　十月革命五十周年前后，苏修统治集团开动宣传机器，特别起劲地吹嘘什么“一切为了人，一切为了人的福利”。他们力图给资本主义在苏联的全面复辟，涂上一层“全民福利”的色彩。
    所谓“全民福利”，同“全民国家”一样，完全是骗人的鬼话。在阶级社会里，根本就不存在什么“一切人的福利”，什么超阶级的“全民福利”。有资产阶级的福利，就没有无产阶级的福利。无产阶级有了政权才有了一切，没有政权，就决不会有无产阶级和劳动人民的幸福。
    在苏修叛徒集团统治下的苏联，国家机器掌握在资产阶级特权阶层手里，实行的是彻头彻尾的资产阶级专政。那里，苏修统治集团的所作所为，都是从特权阶层的利益出发的。特权阶层过着纸醉金迷、腐朽糜烂的资产阶级老爷生活，而广大的苏联劳动人民则已重新处于被压迫、被奴役、被剥削的地位。这就是所谓“全民福利”的真相。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流宣扬的“全民福利”，并不是什么新发明，而是从帝国主义者那里捡来的破烂。美帝国主义者就曾经大肆鼓吹所谓“福利国家”，用来欺骗人民，要美国人民勒紧腰带，为华尔街老板牟取暴利“作出特别牺牲”。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流高唱“全民福利”，不过是用来掩盖他们复辟资本主义，实行资产阶级专政，加紧剥削和压榨劳动人民的滔天罪行而已。
    看，苏修吹嘘的“全民福利”是什么货色！
    苏修叛徒集团一方面加紧剥削和压迫苏联广大劳动人民，一方面又装出一副慈善相，吹嘘什么
  “全民福利”的国家。
    假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。苏修叛徒集团标榜“全民福利”，只不过是为了掩盖他们资产阶级特权阶层压迫剥削劳动人民的罪恶勾当而已。　
    苏修集团大肆宣扬所谓“提高职工的工资”，但是实际上苏联职工工资的提高远远赶不上物价的上涨。
    据统计，从一九五九年到一九六五年的六年内，苏联国内的面粉、棉布、皮鞋等十五种主要消费品的零售价格上涨了百分之四十二。而从一九五九年到一九六四年底职工工资只提高了百分之十八点九。
    与广大劳动人民的状况相反，那些挂着“院士”、“厂长”、“经理”招牌的资产阶级分子给自己定了高额的工资。有的科学院院士每月工资高达六千五百卢布，而许多工人每月只能得到六、七十卢布。一家塑料制品工厂的总工程师“自定”的工资每月一千四百卢布，而一般技术工人每月工资才七、八十卢布。
    “国营”商店商品奇缺，自由市场商品价格昂贵，这对苏联广大劳动人民来说是个灾难。最近，《苏维埃商业报》都不得不供认，不少顾客对买不到“价格便宜”的秋冬衣服很有意见，承认货架上放着的“尽是高价”的服装。这种状况引起了广大人民的不满。有的工人说：“现在是十月革命以来最坏的时候，过的是鬼生活”。
    苏修集团大肆吹嘘所谓“缩短”职工工作时间，并在十月革命五十周年时，大吹大擂地推行所谓“五日工作周”。苏修集团还把“五日工作周”说成是“向共产主义过渡”、“提高人民物质福利”的重要措施之一。但事实究竟如何呢？
    所谓“五日工作周”，比原来的规定工作时间并没有丝毫缩短。苏修集团规定，过渡到实行五天工作周的“必需条件”是必须“保证完成实行六天工作周时的全年总工作时间”。
    实行“五日工作周”还给工人带来了很大的生活上的困难。实行“五日工作周”的工厂，每班的午饭休息时间普遍地缩短到二十至三十分钟，夜班则根本不给中间休息时间，连续干七、八个小时。例如，伏尔加市第十五轴承厂，原来的午饭休息时间为一小时，现在，第一班工作八小时，午休二十五分钟；第二班工作八小时，中间休息二十分钟；第三班连续工作七小时十五分，中间毫无休息。用二、三十分钟时间，在拥挤不堪、排满长队的食堂里，工人很难吃上饭。因此，这个厂的工人涅仁科愤愤地说：“这算什么五日工作周？！”《劳动报》透露，一个纺织厂实行了“五日工作周”后，女工抱怨说：“来不及吃午饭”，“食堂里排的队多长呵！我们连杯茶都喝不上。”
    苏修集团推行“利润原则”高于一切的资产阶级经济法则，给广大劳动人民带来了极其严重的后果。
    据苏修《劳动报》透露，基洛夫格勒建筑材料联合工厂厂长为了追求生产数量、追求利润，不顾工人死活，工厂劳动条件十分恶劣：有的“车间里粉尘度极大”，有的车间“煤气含量达到了危险的程度”，工厂里“没有提供生活卫生设备”。该厂一再发生严重的工伤事故，如钳工卢班夜间撞在没有防护装备的转动车轴上受重伤。苏修农业机械制造业的领导人为了追求利润，粗制滥造，农业机械质量极坏，因此“全国各地常常发生拖拉机翻车事故，不少司机受重伤。”尽管工人对这些机器的“设计缺点提出了批评”，但是，工厂为了追求利润却置之不理，继续大量生产。
    苏修报刊透露，“列宁”煤矿公司“共青团”煤矿的领导人为了追求奖金，有意违反安全技术规程。从今年四月以来，该煤矿为了追求超额出煤量，一直不对采煤工作面采取预先喷水的防尘措施。结果煤矿工人长期在煤灰中工作。通风监督人员也因为超额完成产煤任务可以拿到奖金，因而不加干预。
    顿涅茨煤矿数十名工人揭发，由于采用了高效率的联合采煤机和其它设备，使矿井里的灰尘增多起来。“在许多矿井里灰尘的浓度超过了允许的限度”。工人患矽肺病的和工伤事故不断增加。
