North Vietnamese military and civilians, building on their previous successes, fought bravely in November, inflicting heavy losses on American air pirates. They shot down 127 American aircraft in one month (including 25 shot down by male and female militia self-defense teams) and annihilated or captured a large number of air pirates.

On December 3, the Vietnam People's Army Newspaper published an editorial, enthusiastically praising the glorious victories achieved by the North Vietnamese military and civilians in November. It called on all military and civilian personnel to continue to heighten their vigilance, be ready to fight even better battles at any time, and resolutely achieve even greater victories.

The editorial emphasized that U.S. imperialism has suffered a crushing defeat in its war of aggression against South Vietnam and is now in a completely hopeless predicament. However, the Johnson administration still hopes to salvage the plight of the U.S. expeditionary forces in the South by attacking North Vietnam. Johnson recently convened a war council in Washington, where he, on the one hand, repeatedly peddled the deceptive "peace" rhetoric, and on the other hand, is plotting new military adventures against Vietnam. However, no matter how desperately the U.S. aggressors struggle, no matter how much they escalate the war of aggression, they are bound to suffer complete failure. The North Vietnamese military and civilians are determined to severely punish all new U.S. aggressor actions and to give them a heavy blow.

    越南北方军民上月击落美机一百二十七架
    新华社河内三日电　越南北方军民在十一月份再接再厉，英勇战斗，痛歼美国空中强盗。他们在一个月里共击落美国飞机一百二十七架（其中男女民兵自卫队击落二十五架）；消灭和活捉大批飞贼。
    越南《人民军队报》三日发表社论，热烈赞扬越南北方军民在十一月份取得的辉煌胜利，号召全体军民继续提高警惕，随时准备进行更出色的战斗，坚决夺取更大的胜利。
    社论强调指出，美帝国主义在侵略越南南方的战争中遭到了惨败，正在陷入完全没有出路的绝境。但是，约翰逊集团仍然妄想通过对越南北方的袭击，来挽救美国远征军在南方的困境。约翰逊刚在华盛顿召开了战争会议，他一方面喋喋不休地重弹欺诈的“和平”论调，另一方面正在策划对越南的新的军事冒险行动。但是，不管美国侵略者怎样疯狂挣扎，不管他们把侵略战争扩大到什么规模，都必定遭到彻底的失败。越南北方军民决心严惩美国强盗的一切新的战争行动，坚决给它以沉重的打击。
