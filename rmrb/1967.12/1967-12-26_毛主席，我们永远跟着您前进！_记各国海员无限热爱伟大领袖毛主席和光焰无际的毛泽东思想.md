Chairman Mao, We Will Forever Follow You Forward!
—Recounting the Boundless Love of Seafarers from Various Countries for the Great Leader Chairman Mao and the Boundless Glory of Mao Zedong Thought

When ships from five continents and four oceans dock in a Chinese port, foreign seamen and friends of various skin colors often come ashore with hearts full of joy, expressing a common wish: to pay their utmost respect and love to the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and to have boundless faith and admiration for the boundless glory of Mao Zedong Thought. They praise Chairman Mao as the "helmsman of the world revolution" and the "lighthouse in the foggy sea"; they extol Chairman Mao's works as the "red treasure book" and the "treasure trove of truth"; they compare the center of the world revolution—Beijing—to the "flag of revolution" and the "symbol of victory."

Mao Zedong is the Greatest Leader in the World

One day, several Greek seamen, cameras slung over their shoulders, eagerly came ashore. As soon as they stepped into the International Seamen's Club, they saw a giant statue of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. With boundless reverence, they gazed up at Chairman Mao's lofty and radiant image. They held the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their hands and stood upright in front of Chairman Mao's statue to have their picture taken. Some of them said, "To have our picture taken in front of the statue of the greatest and wisest leader in the world, Chairman Mao, is the greatest happiness of our lives." Others enthusiastically told the club's staff, "Mao Zedong is the greatest leader in the world."

Indian People Miss Chairman Mao

One morning, border inspection officers were engrossed in their "Daily Reading" with the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in hand. At that moment, an Indian seaman approached from afar, his eyes fixed on the red treasure book in the inspection officer's hands. The officer understood his feelings and warmly invited him to sit down and study together. The officer translated several passages from Chairman Mao's works into English for him, word by word. The Indian seaman listened intently, like a parched crop absorbing dew. When the "Daily Reading" ended, the seaman still sat there, his weather-beaten face showing a look of deep longing. The officers understood his intentions and sincerely gave him an English edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The Indian seaman took the bright red treasure book with great emotion, tears welling up in his eyes as he said, "Beijing—Mao Zedong—good!" "The Indian people all love Chairman Mao and miss Chairman Mao." He wiped away the tears on his face, clenched his fist, and shook it in front of him to express his determination to fight, then happily ran back to the ship with the joy of a new soldier receiving a weapon.

Japanese People Urgently Need the Revolutionary Treasure Book

A young Japanese seaman, visiting China for the first time, dreamed of obtaining the long-awaited treasure book—the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." As soon as the ship docked, he rushed straight to the International Seamen's Club, eager to get Chairman Mao's works. When he saw the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" displayed in the club, he was overjoyed. He quickly ran over, held the treasure book tightly to his chest. Tears of joy welled up in his eyes, and he murmured to himself, "Oh, I've been waiting and waiting, and today I finally have the treasure book in my hands!" Then, he carefully examined the portrait of Chairman Mao on the book's cover page, immersed in boundless happiness. He poured out his heart to the service staff, saying that the Japanese revolutionary people love Chairman Mao and yearn for Mao Zedong Thought. He said solemnly, "We, the Japanese people, are in such urgent need of this revolutionary treasure book!"

Long Live Mao Zedong!

A female traveler from Africa, upon hearing that the ship would dock in a Chinese port, jumped for joy.

After the ship docked, she requested to go ashore to see the long-awaited world revolutionary base—China. To fulfill her wish, the border inspection officer issued her a landing permit. As soon as she stepped ashore, she did not go anywhere else but stood respectfully in front of Chairman Mao's portrait near the pier, gazing up at it for nearly twenty minutes. Then, she picked up a handful of soil from the ground with great affection, wrapped it carefully in a handkerchief. She returned to the ship with a heart full of joy and excitedly told a Chinese friend, "This is the soil from the land of New China led by Chairman Mao. I will keep it as the best memento." The Chinese friend was moved by her boundless love for Chairman Mao and voluntarily gave her a colored portrait of Chairman Mao and a Chairman Mao badge. When she received these two gifts, she exclaimed excitedly, "Long live Mao Zedong!"

Chairman Mao is the Lenin of Our Time

One day, a Soviet revolutionary film was being screened at the International Seamen's Club. When the great image of the great leader of the proletarian revolution, Lenin, appeared on the screen, dozens of Soviet seamen in the audience spontaneously shouted in unison, "Hurrah! Hurrah!" The scene of Bolshevik warriors attacking the Winter Palace under Lenin's leadership stirred the hearts of the Soviet seamen. They thought of the reality of white terror under the rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, feeling extremely indignant. Like ships in the foggy sea yearning for a lighthouse, they longed for Lenin and for the Lenin of our time—Mao Zedong.

As soon as the film ended, the Soviet seamen immediately held the hands of the Chinese comrades and said, "Such films have long been banned in the Soviet Union. We are very honored to see such a film in great China." They said, "The revolutionary ship of the Soviet Union is sailing in a foggy sea shrouded in dark clouds, but we have already seen the lighthouse of progress, the great helmsman Mao Zedong. We will forever follow you forward! Forward!"

Wish Chairman Mao Eternal Life!

In the seamen's club, artistic performances praising the great leader Chairman Mao moved the hearts of seamen from various continents. A British child, who looked to be not yet ten years old, was watching the performance intently with his mother. When Chairman Mao's radiant image appeared on the screen, the entire audience burst into enthusiastic applause, and someone stood up and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Hearing the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao," the innocent British child eagerly asked his mother for an explanation. When he understood the meaning of the slogan, he suddenly left his seat, jumping and shouting, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" This voice resonated throughout the audience, and the seamen from various countries, speaking different languages, shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

    毛主席，我们永远跟着您前进！
    ——记各国海员无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席和光焰无际的毛泽东思想
    当来自五大洲四大洋的远航船只在中国的一个海港停泊的时候，经常有许多不同肤色的外国海员和外国朋友怀着无限喜悦的心情登上岸去，倾吐他们一个共同的心愿：对世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席无限尊敬，无限热爱，对光焰无际的毛泽东思想无限信仰，无限崇拜。他们歌颂毛主席是“世界革命的舵手”、“雾海航行的灯塔”；赞扬毛主席著作是“红色的宝书”、“真理的宝库”；把世界革命的中心——北京比作“革命的旗帜”和“胜利的象征”。
      毛泽东是世界上最伟大的领袖
    一天，几名希腊籍的海员背着照相机，兴冲冲地登上了岸。他们一跨进国际海员俱乐部的大门，就看到世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的巨大塑像。他们怀着无限崇敬的心情，仰望着毛主席崇高而光辉的形象。他们手里捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，端端正正地站在毛主席塑像前照相留念。他们中有的人说：“我们能在全世界最伟大、最英明的领袖毛主席的塑像前照相，是一生最大最大的幸福。”有的人满腔热情地对俱乐部的工作人员说：“毛泽东是世界上最伟大的领袖。”
      印度人民想念毛主席
    一个清晨，海港边防检查员们手捧着《毛泽东选集》，正在那里专心致志地进行“天天读”。当时，从远处来了一位印度海员，他走到边防检查员身边，两眼直盯着检查员手中的红色宝书。检查员领会他的心情，便热情地请他坐下来一同学习。检查员用英语逐字逐句地把毛主席的几段话翻译给他听，这位印度海员聚精会神地听着，象久旱的禾苗吸饮着雨露。“天天读”结束了，可是，这位海员还坐在那里不走，他那饱经风霜的脸上露出了一副十分渴望的神情。检查员们明白他的心意，便诚恳地送给他一本英文版的《毛主席语录》。这位印度海员十分激动地接过了红彤彤的宝书，热泪盈眶地说：“北京——毛泽东——好！”“印度人民都热爱毛主席，想念毛主席。”说着，他抹去脸上的泪花，捏紧拳头在面前晃动了一下，表示自己斗争的决心，随后，便怀着象新战士获得武器一样喜悦的心情，兴奋地跑回船去。
      日本人民急需革命宝书
    一位第一次来到中国的日本青年海员，心里想的是能够得到梦寐以求的宝书——《毛泽东选集》。船刚靠岸，他就直奔国际海员俱乐部，一心一意想得到毛主席著作。当他在俱乐部里看到陈列着的《毛泽东选集》时，真高兴极了。他飞快地跑过去，双手捧起宝书，紧紧地贴在胸前。顿时，喜悦的热泪便夺眶而出，老半天才自言自语地说：“哦，盼啊盼，今天总算把宝书盼到手了！”接着，他又仔细地端详着书中扉页上的毛主席像，沉浸在无限的幸福之中。他向服务员滔滔不绝地倾诉了日本革命人民热爱毛主席、渴望毛泽东思想的心情。他语重心长地说：“我，我们日本人民是多么急需这本革命的宝书啊！”
        毛泽东万岁！
    一位来自非洲的过境女旅客，听说轮船要在中国港口停泊，她高兴得跳了起来。
    轮船靠岸后，她要求上岸，想看看久久向往的世界革命根据地——中国。为了满足她的心愿，边防检查员给她发了登陆证。这位旅客一上岸什么地方也不去，却恭恭敬敬地站在码头附近的毛主席画像前面，出神地仰望了十几分钟。然后，她无限深情地在地上抓起一把泥土，用手帕珍惜地包起来。她满心欢喜回到了船上，非常兴奋地对中国朋友说：这是毛主席领导的新中国土地上的土，我留它作为最好的纪念。中国朋友被她这种无限热爱毛主席的精神所感动，主动将自己的一张彩色毛主席像和一枚毛主席像章赠送给了这位非洲妇女。当她双手接过这两件礼物时，激动地高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”
        毛主席是当代的列宁
    一天，国际海员俱乐部里正在放映一部苏联革命电影。当银幕上出现伟大的无产阶级革命导师列宁的伟大形象时，在场的数十名苏联海员情不自禁地同声欢呼起来：“乌拉！乌拉！”布尔什维克战士在列宁的领导下攻打冬宫的情景激动了苏联海员的心，他们联想到眼前的苏联——在苏修领导集团统治下的白色恐怖的现实，感到无比的气愤。他们象雾海的航船向往灯塔一样怀念着列宁，向往着当代的列宁——毛泽东。
    电影刚放映完，苏联海员就立刻拉住中国同志的手说：“象这样的电影在苏联早就被禁止放映了。我们很荣幸，能在伟大的中国看到这样的电影。”他们说：“苏联革命的航船正行驶在被乌云笼罩着的雾海里，可是，我们已经看到了前进的灯塔，伟大的舵手毛泽东，我们永远跟着您前进！再前进！”
        祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    在海员俱乐部里，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的文艺节目激动着来自各大洲的各国海员的心。一个看上去还不满十岁的英国儿童跟他妈妈一起在全神贯注地观看演出。当天幕上出现毛主席的光辉形象时，全场响起了热烈的掌声，有人站起来高呼：“毛主席万岁！”听到
  “毛主席万岁”这个口号，那个天真烂漫的英国儿童便伏在他妈妈身上，急于要问个明白。当他知道了这个口号的含义时，突然离开座位，蹦跳着欢呼：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”这声音在全场引起了热烈的回响，在场的各国海员们操着不同的语言一遍又一遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
