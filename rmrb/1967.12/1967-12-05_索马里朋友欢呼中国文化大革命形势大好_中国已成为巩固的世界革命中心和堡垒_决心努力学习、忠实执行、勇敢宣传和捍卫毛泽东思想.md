Some Somali friends who have organized themselves to regularly study the works of Chairman Mao recently wrote an article saying: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is an event of great historical and international significance that has shaken the world. Chairman Mao Zedong has enriched and developed the theory of world revolution, solving in theory and in practice a series of problems regarding the continuation of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the prevention of capitalist restoration."

They jointly wrote in the article: "The powerful cultural revolution undoubtedly accelerates the progress of history and humanity. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only prevents capitalist restoration in China but is also a major struggle against imperialism led by the United States and against modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries in the world."

The article states: "Through the great cultural revolution, China has become an even more consolidated center and bastion of world revolution."

The article emphasizes: "Chairman Mao Zedong not only leads the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people forward but also leads all oppressed peoples and nations of the world forward. Therefore, Chairman Mao Zedong is not only the great leader and great teacher of the Chinese people but also the great leader beloved by the revolutionary peoples of the world. Great Mao Zedong Thought has become a powerful ideological weapon and guiding principle for the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions in their struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in their respective countries."

These Somali friends also expressed: "We must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, faithfully execute Mao Zedong Thought, and courageously propagate and defend Mao Zedong Thought."

The article concludes with the slogans: "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

Another Somali friend wrote in a letter to Chinese friends: "Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, after more than a year of vigorous mass movement, has achieved decisive and historic victories." He exults: "The current revolutionary and production situation in China is unprecedentedly good, which is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

He points out: Imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, and reactionaries in various countries, fearing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, have formed an anti-China 'holy alliance,' launching one anti-China movement after another. He points out that these imperialist-revisionist-reactionaries will not meet a good end.

    索马里朋友欢呼中国文化大革命形势大好
    中国已成为巩固的世界革命中心和堡垒
    决心努力学习、忠实执行、勇敢宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想
    新华社摩加迪沙电　一些自己组织起来定期学习毛主席著作的索马里朋友最近写文章说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是在历史上和国际上极为重要的震撼世界的大事。毛泽东主席发展和丰富了世界革命的理论，在理论上和实际上解决了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命和防止资本主义复辟的一系列问题。”
    他们合写的文章指出：“强有力的文化革命毫无疑问加速了历史和人类的进步。无产阶级文化大革命不仅防止了在中国发生资本主义复辟，而且是反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的一场重要斗争。无产阶级文化大革命给予了帝国主义、修正主义和全世界一切反动派沉重的打击。”
    文章说：“通过伟大的文化革命，中国已经成为更加巩固的世界革命的中心和堡垒。”
    文章强调说：“毛泽东主席不仅领导中国革命和中国人民前进，而且领导着全世界一切被压迫的人民和民族前进，因此，毛泽东主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖和伟大导师，而且是全世界革命人民敬爱的伟大领袖。伟大的毛泽东思想已经成为亚非拉和世界其他地区人民对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派进行斗争的强大的思想武器和指导原则。”
    这些索马里朋友还表示说：“我们一定要努力学习毛泽东思想，忠实地执行毛泽东思想，勇敢地宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想。”
    文章最后高呼：“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    另一位索马里朋友在一封写给中国朋友的信中说：“在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指导下开展的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，经过一年多的轰轰烈烈的群众运动以后，取得了具有历史意义的巨大的决定性胜利。”他欢呼：“中国目前的革命和生产形势空前大好，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”
    他指出：以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派由于对战无不胜的毛泽东思想和中国的无产阶级文化革命怕得要死，结成了反华“神圣同盟”，掀起了一个又一个反华运动。他指出，这些帝修反决不会有好下场。
