		Persistently Promote Mao Zedong Thought and Firmly Believe in and Rely on the Masses

The experiences of the 834th Unit's leftist support team at the Beijing Knitting Factory have set a brilliant example for us in doing leftist support work. Their experiences have helped us further clarify that the fundamental principle of doing leftist support work is to persistently promote Mao Zedong Thought and firmly believe in and rely on the masses, to follow every step of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and to carry out every instruction from Chairman Mao.

The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is the universal panacea for doing all work. Our support for the proletarian revolutionary faction is fundamentally about arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought and helping them use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything.

In the process of promoting revolutionary unity throughout the factory, some of the masses initially did not understand our actions, saying we were "rightist" and "conciliatory." Why did the masses have objections even though we were acting according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions? It was because we did not, at the beginning, conduct in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work among the masses like the leftist support comrades of the 834th Unit. We did not, like them, propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to every person and every corner, ensuring that not only the workers but also all family members knew about them. Later, we extensively and deeply mobilized all the workers and family members in the factory to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, guiding the masses to think and act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. As a result, revolutionary unity throughout the factory was quickly realized. From then on, we gained an experience: no matter what work we do, we must first extensively propagate Chairman Mao's relevant instructions to the masses, mobilize them to deeply study and thoroughly understand, and voluntarily carry out and implement them.

To firmly believe in and rely on the masses, we must also follow Chairman Mao's teachings, believing that the masses can educate and liberate themselves. As long as we widely and deeply propagate Chairman Mao's teachings to the masses and do in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work, arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, the masses will be able to educate and liberate themselves. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses have a great socialist initiative." Our leftist support work is to directly give Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, turning Chairman Mao's teachings into the masses' voluntary actions, and bringing out the socialist initiative within the masses to fully implement every instruction from Chairman Mao. In the work of promoting the establishment of the factory revolutionary committee, we initially had many concerns and fears of making mistakes. Later, we on one hand reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line, and on the other hand, extensively and publicly mobilized all the masses to study Chairman Mao's five conditions for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and organized the masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People." The masses overcame selfishness and dispelled factionalism, and the factory revolutionary committee was elected with people who were most satisfactory to the masses.

The 834th Unit is a red flag in leftist support work, and every experience they gained is worth our repeated study. In the future, we must, like them, with an unyielding class sentiment of loyalty to Chairman Mao, closely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, persistently promote Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly believe in and rely on the masses, doing the leftist support work better and better.

    八三四一部队支左人员在北京针织总厂的支左经验，给我们做好支左工作树立了光辉的榜样。他们的经验，帮助我们进一步明确认识到：做好支左工作的根本，就是坚持不懈地宣传毛泽东思想，坚定不移地相信和依靠群众，对毛主席的伟大战略部署步步紧跟，对毛主席的最新指示句句照办。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是做好一切工作的万能法宝。我们支持无产阶级革命派，最最根本的一条就是用毛泽东思想来武装他们的头脑，帮助他们用毛泽东思想来统帅一切。
    我们在促进全厂革命大联合的过程中，开始有的群众对我们的行动不理解，说我们“右倾”、“调和”。我们按照毛主席的最新指示办事，为什么群众还有意见呢？就因为我们一开始没有象八三四一部队支左同志那样，向群众进行深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作；没有象他们那样把毛主席的最新指示宣传到每一个人、每一个角落，不仅让职工群众知道，也让广大家属知道。后来，我们广泛深入地发动全厂职工和家属学习了毛主席的最新指示，促使广大群众按照毛主席的教导去想、去做，结果很快地实现了全厂革命大联合。从此以后，我们有了一项经验：不论进行什么工作，必须首先向广大群众大讲特讲毛主席的有关指示，发动群众深入学习，认真领会，自觉地贯彻执行。
    要做到坚定不移地相信群众和依靠群众，也必须按照毛主席的教导，相信群众能够自己教育自己，自己解放自己。只要我们把毛主席的教导，广泛深入地向群众进行宣传，做好深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，用毛泽东思想把群众武装起来，群众就能自己教育自己，自己解放自己。毛主席教导我们：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性”。我们的支左工作，就是要把毛泽东思想直接交给群众，把毛主席的教导变为群众自觉自愿的行动，把群众中的社会主义积极性激发出来，不折不扣地实现毛主席的每一项指示。我们在促进建立厂革命委员会的工作上，开始时有不少顾虑，怕犯错误。后来，我们一方面重温了毛主席有关群众路线的教导，一方面大张旗鼓地发动全体群众学习毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的五项条件，并组织群众反复学习了毛主席《为人民服务》等光辉著作。群众破除了私心，克服了派性，厂革命委员会就选出了群众最满意的人。
    八三四一部队是支左工作的一面红旗，他们取得的每一项经验，都值得我们反复学习。今后，我们一定要象他们那样，以无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持不懈地宣传毛泽东思想，坚定不移地相信群众和依靠群众，把支左工作做得好上加好。
