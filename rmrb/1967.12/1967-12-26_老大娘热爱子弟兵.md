It was still dark when the enemy invaded Chengtian Province's Fuyang Township. The People's Liberation Army soldiers had already prepared and were ready for battle. At exactly 5 a.m., the PLA began a fierce barrage of gunfire against the enemy. The battle was intense and continued until the afternoon. The enemy called in air support, and the enemy planes roared and screamed in the sky, indiscriminately dropping bombs on the village.

K Grandma sat in the air-raid shelter, her heart racing with worry. She was always thinking about the soldiers, feeling sorry for them as they had been fighting since early morning and hadn't had a chance to eat. Her love for the soldiers made her disregard her own safety, fearless and determined, she walked out of the air-raid shelter. Amidst the enemy's frenzied barrage of bullets, she bravely went to boil water and cook food for the soldiers. The battlefield was filled with smoke and flying debris. Suddenly, K Grandma's figure appeared. She climbed over the hill and crossed the bomb craters to reach the trenches, bringing the soldiers tea and hot meals.

Grandma's fearless actions and her noble revolutionary spirit of caring for the soldiers greatly inspired and encouraged every soldier, making them even more courageous in their attacks, determined to win a complete victory in the battle.

In the evening, as they returned from the victorious battle, a soldier affectionately asked K Grandma, "Weren't you scared during that battle just now?"

"Grandma loves you all," she replied. "Grandma is not afraid of anything!"

With that, Grandma laughed heartily and cheerfully.

    老大娘热爱子弟兵
    天蒙蒙亮，敌人拥进了承天省富旺乡。解放军战士早已作好了准备，严阵以待。清晨五时整，解放军向敌人开始了猛烈的射击。战斗非常激烈，一直打到下午，敌人叫来了飞机支援，敌机在天空呼啸吼叫，向村里胡乱地倾注着炸弹。
    K大妈坐在防空壕里，心中翻腾不安，她老人家总惦记着战士们，心疼着战士们一清早就投入战斗，直到现在还没有吃饭。热爱战士的一颗红心，使她把个人安危置于度外，毫无畏惧，毅然走出了防空壕，在敌人疯狂的阵阵弹雨中给战士烧水做饭。阵地上硝烟弥漫，沙石飞溅，忽然出现了K大妈的身影。她翻过土丘，越过弹坑来到了战壕里，给战士们送来了茶水热饭。
    大妈无比勇敢的行为和关怀战士们的崇高革命精神，极大地激励和鼓舞着每个战士，使他们更加英勇地冲锋杀敌，誓要夺得战斗的完全胜利。
    傍晚，在战斗胜利结束的归途中，一位战士亲切地问K大妈：“刚才那次战斗您怕吗？”
    “大妈疼你们，大妈什么也不怕！”
    说罢，大妈愉快畅朗地笑着。
