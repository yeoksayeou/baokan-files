Wholeheartedly for the Public, Wholeheartedly for the Revolution
Naval Political Academy Red Fourth Army

	Chinese Khrushchev is the most enthusiastic promoter of private ownership. In his poisonous weed "Be a Good Party Member, Build a Good Party," he says: "One should treat things that belong to the party and the public as one's own things, and treat public property as one's own property, cherishing it, and treat the party's public work as one's own work, putting in heart and soul and taking full responsibility. Only in this way can we have the lofty spirit of sacrificing for the public cause... and become a good party member."

	Look, in these few words, every line is permeated with the word "I." In his view, we engage in revolution only by treating "the party's things" and "the party's work" as "our own things" and "our own work." Everything starts from self-interest, turning public into private, substituting private for public. Only in this way can one have the spirit of struggle, and only in this way can one have the value of sacrifice. This is the greatest insult to us communists.

	Self-interest is the core of the bourgeois worldview. From the day Chinese Khrushchev infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, he has been fighting to maintain and develop the "self." For a long time, he has been advocating bourgeois selfishness under the banner of "the party's public things," and further openly promoting the "philosophy of survival" and the "philosophy of betrayal." His worldview is completely incompatible with the proletarian worldview.

	Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it is thoroughly for the interests of the people." Struggle for the cause of communism to the end. This is the only purpose and the standard for all actions of our communists.

	Comrade Lin Biao points out: "In a certain sense, communism is for the public. Communism can be called 'public' productionism, which is for the public." For the public is the core of the proletarian worldview and also the highest standard for our communists. For the public, we can be like Dong Cunrui, Huang Jiguang, and Mai Xiande, daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire; for the public, we can be like Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and Lei Feng, devoting ourselves to the end; for the public, we can be like Ouyang Hai, Liu Yingjun, Nian Siwang, and Li Wenzhong, fearless in danger, sacrificing ourselves to save others; for the public, we can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, dare to rebel against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and dare to rebel against the reactionary bourgeois line, becoming warriors of "struggling against selfishness" and pioneers of "criticizing revisionism." We communists must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, wholeheartedly for the public, wholeheartedly for the revolution.

	For the public and for self-interest are two completely opposing worldviews. Compromise and reform are not possible, and peaceful coexistence or "public-private joint venture" is also not feasible.

	Chinese Khrushchev is so fervently promoting bourgeois selfishness, forcing it into the Communist Party, aiming to reform our party according to the bourgeois worldview, corrupting and poisoning party members, and implementing peaceful evolution; attempting to cultivate bourgeois successors within our party, thereby achieving his evil goal of usurping the party and the country, and restoring capitalism.

	Recently, Chairman Mao issued a call to arms: to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. This is the fundamental task and fundamental policy of the socialist revolution, and also the fundamental policy for building the party politically and ideologically. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fiercely struggle against the "self," and thoroughly uproot the "revisionist" roots, with even more fierce firepower, thoroughly criticize and expose the black goods peddled by the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, with Chinese Khrushchev as the chief.

### 一心为公　一心为革命

　　一心为公　一心为革命
　　海军政治学校　红四野
    中国赫鲁晓夫是私有观念最卖力的推销商。他在大毒草《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》中，说什么：“应该把属于党的公共的事物，当作自己的事物，应把公家的东西当作自己的东西一样来爱惜它，把党的公共的工作当作自己的工作一样尽心努力负责的去作。只有这样，我们才能有为公共事业而牺牲奋斗的高尚的精神，……才成为一个好的党员。”
    看，在这寥寥数语中，字里行间都浸透了一个“我”字。在他看来，我们干革命，只有把“党的事物”、“党的工作”“当作”我们“自己的事物”、“自己的工作”，一切从私出发，化公为私，以私代公，这样才能有奋斗的精神，这样才有牺牲的价值。这是对我们共产党人的最大污辱。
    为私，是资产阶级世界观的核心。中国赫鲁晓夫从混进革命队伍那天起，就是为了维护一个“私”字，发展一个“私”字而奋斗。长期以来，他打着为“党的公共的事物”的旗号，宣扬一切为自己的资产阶级利己主义，并且进一步公开宣扬“活命哲学”、“叛徒哲学”。他的世界观是同无产阶级世界观格格不入的。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”为共产主义事业奋斗到底，这是我们共产党人一生唯一的目的和一切行动的准则。
    林彪同志指出：“在一定意义上来说，共产主义就是为公，共产主义可以叫做‘公’产主义，是为公的。”为公，就是无产阶级世界观的核心，也是我们共产党员的最高标准。为公，我们就能象董存瑞、黄继光、麦贤得那样，刀山敢上、火海敢闯；为公，我们就能象张思德、白求恩、雷锋那样，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已；为公，我们就能象欧阳海、刘英俊、年四旺、李文忠那样，临危不惧，舍己救人；为公，我们就能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，敢于造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造资产阶级反动路线的反，当“斗私”的勇士，当“批修”的闯将。我们共产党人就是要按照毛主席的教导，一心为公，一心为革命。
    为公和为私，是两种完全对立的世界观，调和、改良是不行的，和平共处、“公私合营”也是办不到的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫如此狂热地鼓吹资产阶级利己主义，硬把它塞进共产党里来，就是想要按照资产阶级世界观来改造我们的党，对党员进行腐蚀、毒害，实行和平演变；妄图在我们党内培养资产阶级接班人，从而达到他篡党篡国、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    最近，毛主席发出了战斗的号召：要斗私，批修。这是社会主义革命的根本任务和根本方针，也是从政治思想上建党的根本方针。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗“私”字，狠挖“修”根，以更加猛烈的火力，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其所贩卖的修正主义黑货彻底批倒、批臭。
