    Noun Explanations

    Currency Depreciation
    When a country announces a reduction in the legal gold content of its currency unit, or devalues its currency against foreign currencies, it is called currency depreciation. After currency depreciation, a country's goods can be priced lower in foreign markets compared to goods from other countries. Therefore, it is a competitive tool used by capitalist countries to vie for the world market.

    International Balance of Payments
    This refers to the total income and expenditure between a country and foreign countries over a specific period (usually one year). This balance includes trade-related income and expenditure as well as non-trade-related income and expenditure. The latter mainly refers to foreign investment, profits, freight charges, insurance premiums, international travel expenses, and foreign military expenditures. If a country's international balance of payments shows a deficit, it is called an international balance of payments deficit or a trade deficit. If there is a surplus, it is called an international balance of payments surplus.

    Gold Standard
    This refers to the monetary circulation system in which capitalist countries use gold as the standard currency. The gold standard has three basic features: first, gold coins can be freely minted; second, banknotes can be freely exchanged for gold; third, gold can be freely imported and exported. In the 19th century, capitalist countries implemented the gold standard. However, after the global economic crisis of 1929-1933, they gradually abandoned the gold standard. Currently, most capitalist countries operate a paper currency circulation system based on the US dollar, British pound, and gold: countries issue paper currency domestically, which cannot be exchanged for gold, but maintain a fixed exchange rate with the US dollar, British pound, or gold. International settlements between countries are also conducted using the US dollar, British pound, or gold. The gold standard proposed by French President Charles de Gaulle does not refer to the restoration of the 19th-century gold standard but aims to abolish the privileged status of the US dollar and British pound as equivalents to gold.

    International Reserve Currency
    Under the gold standard, the issuance of paper currency by a country is backed by a certain amount of gold. After World War II, the US dollar and British pound were treated as equivalents to gold, and some countries issued their own currencies based on a certain amount of gold or US dollars and British pounds as the credit basis. Thus, the US dollar and British pound became international reserve currencies equivalent to gold.

    名词解释
    货币贬值　一个国家宣布降低本国货币单位中的法定含金量，或贬低本国货币对外国货币的比值，都叫货币贬值。货币贬值后，可以使一国商品在国外市场上的价格低于他国商品的价格，因此，它是资本主义国家争夺世界市场的一种竞争手段。
    国际收支　指在一定时期内（通常为一年）一国与外国之间的全部收入和支出。这种收支包括贸易上的收支和贸易以外的收支。后者主要指国外投资、利润、运费、保险费、国际旅行费、国外军费等等收入和开支。一国的国际收支如果出现入不敷出时，就叫做有了国际收支逆差，或国际收支赤字；如果有盈余时，就称为国际收支顺差。
    金本位制　指资本主义国家以黄金作为本位货币的货币流通制度。金本位制有三个基本特点：一、可以自由铸造金币；二、银行券等可以自由兑换黄金；三、黄金可以自由进出口。十九世纪时，资本主义国家曾经实行过金本位制。但是，在一九二九—一九三三年的世界经济危机后，它们已先后放弃了金本位制。现在，大多数资本主义国家是实行着一种以美元、英镑和黄金为基础的纸币流通制：各国在国内发行纸币，纸币不能兑换黄金，但同时使本国货币同美元、英镑或黄金保持一定比价。国与国之间的收支也用美元、英镑或黄金来进行结算。法国总统戴高乐所建议的恢复金本位制，并不是指恢复十九世纪时期的金本位制，而是要废除美元、英镑等同于黄金的特权地位。
    国际储备货币　在金本位制下，一国发行纸币的数量是以一定数量的黄金作为储备。第二次世界大战后，美元、英镑被当作黄金的等价物，一些国家发行本国货币时，也以一定数量的黄金或美元、英镑作为信用的基础。这样，美元、英镑就被称为等同于黄金的国际储备货币。
