	The counter-revolutionaries who appear in disguise give a false impression while hiding the truth. But since they are counter-revolutionaries, they cannot completely hide the truth.

	Mao Zedong

	The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a surging red torrent, has swept away the headquarters of the bourgeoisie headed by China's Khrushchev and is cleansing all the dark nests under its wings.

	It was in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that a counter-revolutionary clique hidden in the revolutionary ranks for more than twenty years—the "Erliutang"—was thoroughly exposed and thoroughly smashed.

	The "Erliutang" was a band of buglers for China's Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism. For many years, it had done countless counter-revolutionary deeds and committed heinous crimes to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and achieve the restoration of capitalism. It was a genuine Petofi Club-style counter-revolutionary clique.

	The "Erliutang" is a product of Wang Ming and China's Khrushchev's line of capitulationism

	The counter-revolutionary clique "Erliutang" took shape in Chongqing in the early 1940s.

	At that time, the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan was in a difficult stalemate. Under the policy of Japan's imperialist seduction, the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, more fervently implemented a policy of passive resistance to Japan and active opposition to the communists. On the one hand, he cooperated with Japanese imperialism to launch large-scale sweeps in the liberated areas and initiated several major anti-communist campaigns; on the other hand, he handed over the vast lands of the Chinese nation to Japanese imperialism and hid in the Emei Mountains with his tail between his legs.

	It was under these circumstances that Xia Yan, a faithful executor of Wang Ming's line of capitulationism, hoisted the black flag of "national defense literature" and, together with a large number of cultural figures of the 1930s who "attached themselves to the skin of the Kuomintang bureaucratic bourgeoisie," fled in a panic to the provisional capital of the Kuomintang government—Chongqing.

	In Chongqing, a group of so-called cultural figures gathered around Xia Yan. Among them were the trumpeters of "national defense literature," bourgeois writers, painters, directors, and actors, Kuomintang's literary lackeys, officials of the puppet government, even Kuomintang spies, Communist traitors, and big swindlers who pretended to be "anti-Japanese heroes." These people, with their common stench, were united by their reactionary political stance and decadent bourgeois lifestyle. They ate and drank all day, gathered together like flies, spread political rumors, disseminated yellow news, danced, entertained guests, played mahjong, and led extremely decadent lives. They did not feel ashamed but rather proud, calling each other "second-rate rascals" and naming the place where they often gathered "Erliutang," even electing a "councilor" and calling each other "council friends." Thus, a Petofi Club-style organization was formally established.

	The emergence and appearance of the "Erliutang" were not accidental. It was the offspring of the line of class capitulationism and national capitulationism represented by Wang Ming and China's Khrushchev. It was Wang Ming and China's Khrushchev who openly abandoned the policy of "independence and self-reliance" in the United Front against Japan and shamelessly hailed Chiang Kai-shek as the "leader of the revolution." From the day it was born, the "Erliutang" faithfully executed this bourgeois reactionary line and madly slandered Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They raised the tattered flag of "national defense literature," promoting what they called "national defense drama" and "national defense films," praising Xia Yan's thoroughly treacherous play "Saijinhua" as a masterpiece of "patriotism," and calling Wu Zuoguang's play "Wind and Snow Night Return," which fantasized about the Kuomintang reactionaries' "youthful vigor" and "rejuvenation," a "genius" work. They even promoted things like "The Phoenix City," which advocated "orthodox" ideas, advocated "loyalty to the country," whitewashed the Kuomintang reactionary army, and erected monuments for the number one traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

	After national liberation, as the revolution deepened and developed, the "Erliutang" became increasingly reactionary. The core members of the "Erliutang" were deeply nostalgic for the past "golden age" and harbored deep hatred for the proletarian regime. A core member of the "Erliutang" spoke for the group: "Seeing that the class and group to which I am attached is about to collapse, I am unwilling to see this class and group collapse, and I am determined to maintain the interests of this class and group." As expected, some members of the "Erliutang" began to secretly collude and conspire. After careful planning, Xia Yan summoned his "council friends" from Hong Kong and other places and placed them in the old Ministry of Culture, the old Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the news and publishing industry, art academies, and democratic parties. These people, one by one, arrogantly regarded themselves as "old revolutionaries" and "progressive figures," controlling the power of many important departments. Soon, the core members of the "Erliutang" gathered again at the Qifeng Tower in Beijing. After a period of intense preparation, the "Erliutang" was revived under the direct planning and command of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan, in coordination with China's Khrushchev's conspiracy to restore capitalism, and launched one attack after another against the young proletarian dictatorship.

	The political program of the "Erliutang" is to overthrow proletarian dictatorship

	The powerful proletarian dictatorship forced the enemies of the proletariat to disguise themselves more cunningly. The "Erliutang" had a set of sinister and vicious counter-revolutionary strategies and corresponding organizational forms, making its reactionary nature less exposed. On the surface, the "Erliutang" was organized in the form of making friends and recognizing dry siblings, but in reality, it had a relatively strict organization. It not only had a councilor, a council charter, core members, and an outer circle, but also had a place for regular activities. More importantly, they had a common political program. Look at the emblem of the "Erliutang": an old New Year's painting, on which a young master is depicted holding a toy, with another toy placed by his side. They called it "playing without tiring" and "playing in the world." This emblem represents the "Erliutang" group of bourgeois remnants' infinite longing for the "paradise" life of the old society and their hostility and challenge to socialist New China. This is their political program to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism.

	The core members of the "Erliutang" never regarded their organization as merely a club for eating, drinking, and playing but as a political organization. A core member of the "Erliutang" once boasted: "The lowest program of the Communist Party is New Democracy, and the highest program of the 'Erliutang' is New Democracy." It is clear that the "Erliutang" does not want socialism at all. Their so-called "New Democracy" is merely a euphemism for capitalism. They fantasized that "the United States can help us establish a new bourgeois democratic government," in other words, return to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. This is the highest program of the "Erliutang."

	The "Erliutang" is a counter-revolutionary clique that struggles tenaciously for this program.

	To achieve this "highest program," the leaders of the "Erliutang" began to actively plan and prepare for the publication of the "Erliutang" journal "Wanxiang" in the winter of 1956 as "their own territory." The core members of the "Erliutang" not only boasted of turning the "Wanxiang" editorial department into a club but also explicitly stipulated: the Communist Party is not allowed to "interfere in internal affairs"; only articles rejected by publications led by the Party are to be published; criticism of "Wanxiang" should be countered with counter-criticism. In connection with their political program, it is clear what the core members of the "Erliutang" intended to do by publishing "Wanxiang"?

	The "Erliutang" was afraid that it would die out and fail to complete its "lifelong mission," so it carefully cultivated a "successor" small group called the "Small Family." The head of the "Small Family" was Wu Zuoguang, a core member of the "Erliutang" and a bourgeois rightist. The "Small Family," like the "Erliutang," was a genuine counter-revolutionary Petofi Club. Under the manipulation of Wu Zuoguang and others, the "Small Family" quickly became the vanguard of the "Erliutang" in its anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.

	The "Erliutang" used the cover of "literary salons," feigning indifference to politics with eating, drinking, and playing, to engage in covert counter-revolutionary activities. The core members of the "Erliutang" also wore the disguises of writers, painters, and art workers, engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities.

	They specially fabricated, collected, and spread rumors about the Party's leading comrades, directly aiming at the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. They seized on the shortcomings of individual Party members, distorted, exaggerated, and magnified them, portraying the entire Party organization as pitch-black, and then denied the leadership of the Communist Party. They maliciously cursed that the "prestige of the Party is too high," and the Party's "organizational system is stupid." They insidiously said that Qu Yuan, Li Bai, and Du Fu were great writers without the Party's leadership and shouted, "If the institutions do not change... it will be very difficult to get the work done." They attempted to overthrow the Communist Party and take its place.

	They admitted that they had "ten thousand and eight thousand grievances" against the new society and opposed all political campaigns. They maliciously slandered the Party's grain policy, spreading rumors that "tens of thousands of people lined up at the post office in Shanghai to send steamed buns to the countryside"; they cursed the rectification movement as "a knife," making it "difficult to live." They attributed all these to the problem of the "overall system," shouting that "the current government institutions are no different from feudal government institutions," and "China cannot build socialism without going through capitalism," openly opposing socialism and cheering for capitalism and revisionism.

	The core members of the "Erliutang" usually, under the guise of discussing creation, poetry, and art appreciation, maliciously slandered Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts, attacked the Party's literary and artistic policies, and turned literature and art into tools for their counter-revolutionary restoration. Hu Feng attacked Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as "five knives," and they followed suit, shouting that it was "very reasonable" and "written very well"; they also attacked Chairman Mao's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" as having "too many rules and regulations, restricting the development of art"; they even cursed the bas-reliefs on the Monument to the People's Heroes: "These bas-reliefs represent this formulaic era, and it is a monument to this formulaic era." It was extremely vicious and reactionary!

	The core members of the "Erliutang" were all genuine bourgeois hypocrites. When they went out, they wore the masks of writers, painters, actors, and state cadres, but when they returned to the "Erliutang," they drank and gambled for joy. In their own words, they "liked darkness" and "did not like the sun." From this, one can see their filthy, decadent, and moldy souls.

	The "Erliutang" launched three fierce attacks on the Party and socialism

	The "Erliutang" had a counter-revolutionary class sensitivity and long experience in class struggle. Sometimes they were blinded by greed and fought bare-chested; after failure, they would pretend to be dead and lie down, preserving their strength to make a comeback.

	After liberation, there were three major struggles between the proletariat and the counter-revolutionary Petofi Club "Erliutang."

	In 1955, after a long period of collusion and preparation, the "Erliutang" had accumulated some strength and began to stir. Some members of the "Erliutang," either originally Hu Feng's followers or closely connected with Hu Feng, loudly cheered when Hu Feng threw out his infamous "opinion book," shouting "reasonable"; after the first batch of materials of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was published, they shouted, "I am more convinced that Hu Feng is correct." After the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was exposed, China's Khrushchev vigorously shielded them, saying, "Against Hu Feng, it is not to overthrow him," and that they should "adopt a helpful attitude." Xia Yan also released smoke bombs, saying that "Hu Feng is going to Hangzhou for convalescence," to reassure the frightened followers of the "Erliutang." However, the great historical significance of the rectification movement gave them a heavy blow, and they had to quickly retreat and pretend to be dead.

	As Chairman Mao taught us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves." After the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the Hungarian incident, the revisionist trend surged internationally, and the "Erliutang" and the domestic ghosts and snakes could no longer restrain themselves. China's Khrushchev was the first to jump out, vigorously advocating the theory of the "extinction of class struggle" and attacking the socialist system in a veiled manner, saying, "There is no absolutely good system." China's Khrushchev's outcry was a signal to incite the rightists to rebel.

	The "Erliutang" gang was ecstatic about this "new trend." They frequently visited each other, exchanged secret letters, and enthusiastically cheered, "Good weather," "Great wind and rain, how lively!" They fiercely shouted, "If not now, when?" Thus, they all went into battle bare-chested. They imitated China's Khrushchev's tone, shouting, "The socialist system has problems," attacking "Stalin's personal dictatorship," and hysterically shouting, "We should thank Khrushchev!" When our Party issued the call for rectification, they mistakenly believed that the time had come and "summoned the wind and rain, stirred up waves, or plotted in secret rooms, or ignited at the grassroots level," leading and organizing attacks on the Party and socialism. They traveled far to the northwest, stirring up trouble; they stayed in Beijing, "speaking out loudly." They planned for Wu Zuoguang to ignite the fire at the Peking Opera House and Peking University, and after the first shot was fired, others would follow. They encouraged each other, saying, "I saw your 'small outcry,' and I want to see your 'big outcry'"; in action, they had a unified target, shouting to direct the spearhead at "the entire system." They madly shouted, "China implemented socialism too early," slandering the Party and revolutionary people as "fools who go to the hot springs to catch fish and cook them." However, the more the enemy revealed itself, the more miserable its failure. The call to action against the rightists quickly sounded, and despite the efforts of Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and other counter-revolutionary revisionists to shield them, a batch of rightist members of the "Erliutang" were still exposed.

	The living facts of class struggle show: as long as the enemy has a breath, it will inevitably struggle to the death. In 1961, some rightists exposed by the "Erliutang" returned from labor reform, and they resumed collusion activities in a more covert manner. Sometimes they gathered under the pretext of visiting the sick, restoring the past life of the "Erliutang"; sometimes they adopted "scattered guerrilla-style activities," dividing into smaller groups to expand their ranks. They proudly shouted, "'Erliutang' people cannot be dispersed!" Someone even bluntly shouted, "Criticizing 'Erliutang' is biased!" They took advantage of the temporary difficulties in our country's national economy, coordinating with China's Khrushchev's frantic activities to restore capitalism, imitating the tone of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, cursing the Chinese people for not having enough to eat or wear, and slandering the brilliant three red banners. They called their activities in the "Erliutang" "temporarily living the Hong Kong life," and their desire to restore counter-revolution was how urgent!

	Despite the "Erliutang" playing one trick after another, launching one attack after another against the Party and socialism, they ultimately could not escape their doom.

	The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan is the black commander of the "Erliutang"

	The experience of class struggle in our socialist period tells us: the overthrown exploiting class will seek their agents within our Party to carry out activities to restore capitalism. Iron facts prove that China's Khrushchev's important agent in the literary and artistic field, Xia Yan, is precisely the black commander of the "Erliutang."

	As early as the Chongqing period, Xia Yan was a guest and black master of the "Erliutang." He appeared as the embodiment of the Party, mixing in the "Erliutang" every day, doing unspeakable deeds. After liberation, Xia Yan wholeheartedly attached himself to China's Khrushchev, becoming an important agent of this number one ambitious man in the literary and artistic field. Thus, he naturally became the patron of the "Erliutang." The members of the "Erliutang" respected Xia Yan as "Xia Gong," called him "Xia Bo," and even more respectfully addressed him as "dry father," and even more respectfully wrote to Xia Yan, saying, "Those who gave birth to me are my parents, and those who understand me are Xia Gong." This is a self-incriminating confession, revealing the filthy relationship between Xia Yan and the "Erliutang."

	The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan was an active participant in the decadent life of the "Erliutang" and a provider of political rumors. He not only took the lead in associating with old book dealers and buying pornographic books and paintings but also actively exonerated this evil behavior, saying, "This is a private matter, it doesn't matter"; he not only openly disclosed many important secrets of the Party but also fabricated a large number of rumors, letting the "Erliutang" broadcast them far and wide as "bullets" to attack the Party. More importantly, Xia Yan set the tone for the reactionary political program of the "Erliutang." He repeatedly spread to the core members of the "Erliutang" that "the Chinese revolution developed from the countryside and did not go through the capitalist stage, so it lacks democracy, and this lesson must be made up in the future." A core member of the "Erliutang" even more nakedly shouted, "China cannot build socialism without going through capitalism." Xia Yan wanted to "make up" for capitalism. He indeed, together with the people of the "Erliutang," actively carried out activities to restore capitalism, attempting to "make up" for "this lesson."

	The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan was also the direct commander of the "Erliutang" in its attacks on the Party and socialism and the backstage boss who covered their retreat. In 1955, when the "Erliutang" was frantically active in coordination with the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique's attack, Xia Yan gave them information and bolstered their courage; after the rectification movement began, Xia Yan also vouched for them, even saying that a Kuomintang reactionary official was a "progressive cartoonist" who had "helped us a lot." In the spring of 1957, when the "Erliutang" was actively preparing to publish the journal "Wanxiang," Xia Yan actively supported this reactionary journal and was actively preparing to write for it, encouraging them to "speak out loudly" and attack the Party. When the fierce struggle against the rightists began, Xia Yan, with his counter-revolutionary class "sensitivity," quickly disguised himself, commanding the core members of the "Erliutang" to quickly retreat. He himself appeared in the guise of a hero against the rightists, using the stolen Party and government power to shield the "Erliutang" in every possible way, performing a farce of sacrificing the soldiers and horses to preserve the generals. He reluctantly gave up the second generation of the "Erliutang," the "Small Family," and even threw in a few prominent members of the "Erliutang," but preserved himself and the strength of the "Erliutang," intending to revive and rise again. At the meeting to criticize Wu Zuoguang, he said, "In the past two years, I have had less contact, and there have been few things to discuss with me," saying that because of his "sentimentality and excessive care," he was "deceived" by Wu Zuoguang. This is a big lie! After the head passed, he colluded with Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Tan Han, letting those members of the "Erliutang" who were not exposed and their close friends appear in the guise of "leftists," speaking out at the criticism meeting, and performing a farce of Zhou Yu striking Yue Fei. On the eve of the meeting to criticize the rightist Wu Zuoguang, Tan Han used a car to pick up Wu Zuoguang to his home, where Zhou Yang, who had been waiting there, comforted him in every possible way, saying, "Tomorrow... your meeting will be held, you have not participated in any political struggle in the past, lack experience in political struggle, so I invited you to talk." "You should be mentally prepared to listen to all kinds of harsh words." After the talk, Zhou Yang personally sent Wu Zuoguang back home in a small car before leaving with relief. Look, how intense the hatred and love of Zhou Yang and Xia Yan are, and how clear their reactionary stance is!

	After the struggle against the rightists, most of the rightists exposed by the "Erliutang" went to labor reform. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan still had deep feelings for them. When these rightists returned to Beijing one after another, Xia Yan used his authority to remove their hats one by one and arranged them in various positions in the literary and artistic field, resuming their past contacts. In 1962, when the "Hai Rui" who had been dismissed from office was revived on the stage and a wave of rehabilitation swept the country, Xia Yan began to counterattack with the core members of the "Erliutang." The rightists exposed by the "Erliutang" clamored for rehabilitation, and Xia Yan gave them advice, telling them to "write some materials." Until the eve of this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they still frantically slandered the revolutionary significance of the Peking Opera Revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing, stubbornly resisted Chairman Mao's two extremely important instructions on literature and art, and made a final struggle.

	Lenin pointed out: "When the old society is dying, its corpse cannot be put into a coffin and buried in a grave. It rots and stinks among us and poisons us." The "Erliutang" is such a dark nest left over from the old society, emitting a foul odor and poisoning the people. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary Petofi Club "Erliutang," and thoroughly criticize the black commander of the "Erliutang," Xia Yan, and his chief backer, China's Khrushchev!

　　粉碎中国的裴多菲俱乐部“二流堂”
　　南卫东
    以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。
　　毛泽东
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，象一股汹涌澎湃的红色巨流，冲垮了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，荡涤着在它卵翼下的一切阴暗的巢穴。
    就在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，一个隐藏在革命队伍里二十多年的反革命集团——“二流堂”彻底暴露、彻底完蛋了。
    “二流堂”是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的一个唢呐队。多年以来，它为了颠覆无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟，干尽了反革命勾当，犯下了滔天罪行。这是一个地地道道的裴多菲俱乐部式的反革命集团。
　　“二流堂”是王明和中国赫鲁晓夫投降主义路线的产物
    反革命集团“二流堂”是四十年代初期在重庆形成的。
    当时，中国人民抗日战争正处在艰苦的相持阶段。在日本帝国主义的诱降政策下，人民公敌蒋介石更加卖命地推行消极抗日、积极反共的反动政策。他一方面配合日本帝国主义向解放区进行大扫荡，连续发动了几次大规模的反共高潮；另一方面拱手把中华民族的大好河山献给日本帝国主义，自己夹着尾巴躲在峨眉山上。
    就在这种情况下，王明投降主义路线的忠实执行者夏衍，打着“国防文学”的黑幡，伙同一大批“依附在国民党官僚资产阶级皮上”的三十年代文化人，仓仓惶惶地逃到了国民党政府的陪都——重庆。
    在重庆，夏衍的周围麇集着一批所谓的文化人。他们之中，有“国防文学”的吹鼓手，有资产阶级作家、画家、导演和演员，有蒋介石的御用文人，有伪政府的达官显贵，甚至有国民党的特务，共产党的叛徒，冒充“抗日英雄”的大骗子……。这些人臭味相投，反动的政治立场和腐朽糜烂的资产阶级生活方式把他们紧紧地联系在一起。他们饱食终日，蝇聚一起，散布政治性流言蜚语，传播黄色新闻，跳舞、请客、打麻将，过着极端腐朽糜烂的生活。他们不以为耻，反以为荣，互相指为二流子，把他们经常鬼混的地方叫做“二流堂”，并且封了堂长，互称堂友，一个裴多菲俱乐部式的团体就这样正式形成了。
    “二流堂”的产生和出现决非偶然。它是以王明和中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的阶级投降主义和民族投降主义路线的产儿。正是王明和中国赫鲁晓夫，公然放弃抗日民族统一战线中的“独立自主”政策，无耻地尊奉蒋介石为“革命领袖”。“二流堂”从它脱胎的那一天起，就忠实地执行了这一套资产阶级反动路线，疯狂地诋毁毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们扯起“国防文学”的破旗，大搞什么“国防戏剧”“国防电影”，把夏衍的彻底的卖国主义戏剧《赛金花》吹捧为“爱国主义”的杰作，把吴祖光幻想国民党反动派“丰采如旧”“返老还童”的戏剧《风雪夜归人》说成是“天才”著作。甚至把宣扬“正统”观念，主张“精忠报国”，替国民党反动军队涂脂抹粉，为头号卖国贼蒋介石树碑立传的《凤凰城》等乌七八糟的东西也拿来上市。
    全国解放之后，随着革命的日益深入和发展，“二流堂”愈来愈显示出它的反动性。“二流堂”的骨干对逝去的“黄金时代”万分眷恋，对无产阶级政权刻骨仇恨。“二流堂”的一个骨干分子说出了他们一伙的心里话：“眼看我自己所依附的阶级集团要垮台了，我不甘心这个阶级的垮台，我决心要维护这个阶级和集团的既得利益。”果其不然，“二流堂”中的一些人便上窜下跳，秘密串联了。经过一番周密策划，由夏衍从香港等地把他的堂友召回，把他们安插到旧文化部、旧文联各协会、新闻出版界、艺术院校和民主党派中。这些人一个个俨然以“老革命”、“进步人士”自命，控制了许多重要部门的大权。不久，“二流堂”的骨干分子又欢聚在北京的栖凤楼。经过了一阵紧张的准备，“二流堂”重新复活了，在反革命修正主义分子夏衍的直接策划指挥下，配合着中国赫鲁晓夫一伙复辟资本主义的阴谋活动，向年轻的无产阶级专政射出了一支又一支的毒箭，发起了一次又一次的猖狂进攻。
　　“二流堂”的政治纲领是颠覆无产阶级专政
    强大的无产阶级专政，迫使无产阶级的敌人更加狡猾地伪装起来。“二流堂”有一套阴险恶毒的反革命策略和与之相适应的组织形式，使其反动本质不易暴露出来。“二流堂”表面上是以交朋友、认干亲的形式组织起来的，实际上却有着比较严密的组织。它不仅有堂长，有堂章，有骨干，有外围，有经常活动的地点，更主要的是他们有着共同的政治纲领。请看“二流堂”的堂徽：一张旧年画，上面画着一个公子哥儿，手里拿着玩具，身旁放着玩具。他们称作“玩儿不厌”“游戏人间”。这个堂徽，表现了“二流堂”这帮资产阶级遗老遗少们对于旧社会“天堂”生活的无限眷恋，表现了他们对社会主义新中国的仇视和挑战。这就是他们要颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的政治纲领。
    “二流堂”的骨干从来就没有把自己的组织仅仅当成吃喝玩乐的俱乐部，而是当成一个政治性团体。“二流堂”的一个骨干分子曾扬言：“共产党的最低纲领是新民主主义，‘二流堂’的最高纲领是新民主主义。”很明显，“二流堂”是根本不要社会主义的，他们所谓的“新民主主义”，只不过是资本主义的代名词，他们幻想“美国能帮助我国建立一个新的资产阶级民主政权”，换句话说，即回到半殖民地半封建社会。这就是“二流堂”的最高纲领。
　　“二流堂”就是为这个纲领而顽强奋斗的反革命集团。
    为了实现这个“最高纲领”，“二流堂”的头头们在一九五六年的冬天便积极酝酿筹办堂刊——《万象》，做为“自己的阵地”。“二流堂”骨干不仅扬言要把《万象》编辑部办成俱乐部，而且还明文规定：不许共产党“干涉内政”；专登一些党所领导的刊物的退稿；对《万象》的批评要进行反批评……。联系他们的政治纲领，“二流堂”的骨干们创办《万象》是为了什么，不是很清楚了吗？
      “二流堂”唯恐自己断种绝代，不能完成“终身之大业”，因此还精心栽培了一个“接班”的小团体——“小家族”。“小家族”的族长由“二流堂”的骨干、资产阶级右派分子吴祖光担任。“小家族”和“二流堂”一样，也是一个地地道道的反革命裴多菲俱乐部。在吴祖光等人操纵下的“小家族”，很快便成为“二流堂”反党反社会主义的急先锋。
      “二流堂”以“文艺沙龙”为保护色，以吃喝玩乐、“不问政治”为幌子，从事着隐蔽的反革命活动。“二流堂”的骨干也都披着作家、画家、艺术工作者的外衣，干着反党反社会主义的勾当。
    他们专门捏造、收集和散布一些有关党的领导同志的流言蜚语，把矛头直接对准以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。他们抓住个别党员身上的某些缺点，加以歪曲、渲染和夸大，把整个党组织描绘得漆黑一团，进而否定共产党的领导。他们恶毒地咒骂“党的威信太高了”，党的“组织制度是愚蠢的”。他们别有用心地说屈原、李白、杜甫没有党的领导也不失为伟大的作家，大叫“机构不变……工作也很难做好了。”妄图把共产党捅下台，由他们取而代之。
    他们不打自招地供认对新社会有“十万八千包袱”牢骚，反对历次的政治运动。他们恶毒地诬蔑党的粮食政策，造谣说“上海邮局门口上万人排队往乡下寄烧饼”；咒骂肃反运动“象一把刀子”，叫你“很难做人”。他们把这些统统归为是“总的制度”的问题，叫喊什么“现在政府机构和封建社会政府机构没什么两样”，“中国不经过资本主义不能建成社会主义”，明目张胆地反对社会主义，并为资本主义、修正主义喝采叫好。
      “二流堂”的骨干平常更以谈创作、论诗画、欣赏艺术为名，恶毒地诽谤毛主席的文艺思想，攻击党的文艺政策，把文艺变成他们手中进行反革命复辟的工具。胡风攻击毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是“五把刀子”，他们跟着叫嚷什么“很有道理”，“写得好极了”；他们还攻击毛主席提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针是“清规戒律太多，限制了艺术的发展”；甚至看了人民英雄纪念碑上的浮雕也破口大骂：“这些浮雕恰好代表这个公式化的时代，它恰好是这个公式化时代的纪念碑”。真是恶毒至极，反动透顶！
      “二流堂”的骨干，都是地地道道的资产阶级伪君子。他们出门戴上作家、画家、演员、国家干部的假面具，回堂则纵酒作欢，赌博取乐。用他们自己的话来说，他们“喜欢黑暗”，“不喜欢太阳”。从这里可以看出他们肮脏、腐朽、发霉的灵魂。
　　“二流堂”对党和社会主义发动的三次猖狂进攻
    “二流堂”有着反革命的阶级敏感，有长期的阶级斗争经验。有时他们利令智昏，赤膊上阵；失败之后，又会装死躺下，保存实力，以求卷土重来。
    解放之后，无产阶级同反革命裴多菲俱乐部“二流堂”之间有着三次较大的斗争。
    一九五五年，“二流堂”经过了长时期的串联准备，积攒了点实力，便蠢蠢欲动了。“二流堂”中的一些人，或者本来就是胡风分子，或者是与胡风有着千丝万缕联系的人，当胡风抛出了臭名昭著的“意见书”后，他们大声喝采，高喊“有道理”；胡风反革命集团的第一批材料公布后，他们又叫道：“我越发觉得胡风是正确的了”。胡风反革命集团被揪出来以后，中国赫鲁晓夫极力加以包庇，胡说什么“对胡风，不是打倒他”，要“采取帮助的态度”。夏衍也放出烟幕弹，说什么“胡风要到杭州疗养去了”，给“二流堂”惊慌失措的娄罗们定心、打气。然而，具有伟大历史意义的肃反运动，狠狠地给了他们当头一棒，他们不得不急忙龟缩回巢，装死躺下。
    正如毛主席教导我们的：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”一九五六年苏共二十大和匈牙利事件后，国际上修正主义思潮大泛滥，“二流堂”和国内的牛鬼蛇神也按捺不住了。中国赫鲁晓夫首先跳出来，大肆鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，含沙射影地攻击社会主义制度，胡说：“没有一种绝对好的制度”。中国赫鲁晓夫的叫嚣，是鼓动右派翻天的信号弹。
      “二流堂”一伙对这个“新动向”欣喜若狂。他们往来频繁，互通黑信，一个劲地欢呼“好气象”，“大风大雨好不热闹”，杀气腾腾地叫嚣“此时不说，尚待何时”。于是，他们一个个赤膊上阵了。他们学着中国赫鲁晓夫的腔调大叫：“社会主义制度就是有问题”，攻击“斯大林个人专政”，歇斯底里地狂呼：“我们要谢谢赫鲁晓夫！”当我党发出整风号召之后，他们错误地认为时机已到，便“呼风唤雨，推涛作浪，或策划于密室，或点火于基层”，有领导、有组织地向党向社会主义发动全面的进攻。他们一路远行西北，煽风点火；一路留在北京，“大鸣大放”。他们计划由吴祖光在评剧院、北大等处点火，第一炮打响后其他方面随之而上。他们互相鼓励，说什么“看到了你的‘小鸣小放’，还要看到你的‘大鸣大放’”；行动上，他们目标一致，叫喊要把矛头对准“整个制度”。他们疯狂地叫嚷“中国过早地实行了社会主义”，诬蔑党和革命人民是“到温泉里去捞汤烧鱼”的蠢人。但是，敌人表现的越充分，就失败的越惨。反右斗争的号角很快地吹响了，尽管周扬、夏衍等反革命修正主义分子百般包庇，“二流堂”这一伙资产阶级右派分子，还是有一批被揪了出来。
    活生生的阶级斗争的事实表明：当敌人还有一口气的时候，它就必然要作垂死的挣扎。一九六一年，“二流堂”中一些被揪出的右派分子陆续劳改回来之后，他们又以更隐蔽的方式进行串联活动了。他们有时以探病为名，聚在一起，暗地恢复“二流堂”过去的生活；有时采取“分散的游击式的活动”，化整为零，扩大营垒。他们得意地狂叫：“‘二流堂’这些人散不了啊！”有人更露骨地喊道：“批判‘二流堂’是有偏差的！”他们趁我国国民经济遭到暂时困难的时候，配合中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的猖狂活动，学着帝、修、反的腔调，大骂中国人民吃不上穿不上，百般诋毁光辉灿烂的三面红旗。他们把在“二流堂”的活动叫做“暂时过一过香港生活”，其梦想反革命复辟之心情，是何等迫切啊！
    尽管“二流堂”玩弄了一套又一套的阴谋，向党向社会主义发起了一次又一次的进攻，但他们终究逃脱不了灭亡的命运。
　　反革命修正主义分子夏衍是“二流堂”的黑主帅
    我国社会主义时期阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：被推翻的剥削阶级要进行资本主义复辟活动，必然要在我们党内寻找他们的代理人。铁的事实证明，中国赫鲁晓夫在文艺界的一个重要代理人夏衍，正是“二流堂”的黑主帅。
    早在重庆时期，夏衍就是“二流堂”的座上客和黑主子。他俨然以党的化身出现，整日在“二流堂”中鬼混，干着不可告人的勾当。解放之后，夏衍死心塌地投靠中国赫鲁晓夫，充当了这个头号野心家在文艺界的重要代理人，这样，他自然而然便成了“二流堂”的靠山。“二流堂”的成员尊夏衍为“夏公”，呼之为“夏伯”，甚者拜其为“干爹”，更甚者竟写信给夏衍说：“生我者父母，知我者夏公也”。真是不打自招，一语道破了夏衍和“二流堂”之间的肮脏关系。
    反革命修正主义分子夏衍，是“二流堂”腐朽糜烂生活的积极参与者，也是“二流堂”政治性流言蜚语的提供者。他不仅带头交结古旧书商，购买淫书淫画，而且积极替这种罪恶行为开脱，说什么“这是私生活的事，没什么关系”；他不仅公开散布党的许多重要机密，而且编造了大量谣言，让“二流堂”四外广播，作为向党进攻的“子弹”。更重要的是，夏衍为
  “二流堂”的反动政治纲领定了调子。他不止一次地给“二流堂”的骨干分子散布什么“中国革命是从农村发展起来，没有经过资本主义阶段，因此缺乏民主性，以后要补上这一课”。“二流堂”的一个骨干分子更赤裸裸地叫嚷：“中国不经过资本主义，建不成社会主义”。夏衍要“补”的就是资本主义。他也的的确确和“二流堂”的人一起，大搞资本主义复辟活动，妄图“补”上“这一课”。
    反革命修正主义分子夏衍，还是“二流堂”历次向党向社会主义进攻的直接指挥者，也是掩护他们退却的后台老板。一九五五年，当“二流堂”配合着胡风反革命集团的进攻猖狂活动时，夏衍给他们通风报信，撑腰壮胆；肃反运动开始后，夏衍又为他们打保票，甚至把一个国民党的反动官吏也说成是“帮了我们不少忙”的“进步漫画家”。一九五七年的春天，“二流堂”积极筹办堂刊《万象》，夏衍积极支持这个反动刊物，而且积极准备给它写稿，并怂恿他们“大鸣大放”，向党进攻。当轰轰烈烈的反右斗争开始之后，有着反革命阶级“敏感”的夏衍连忙伪装起来，指挥着“二流堂”的骨干们赶快退却。他自己却以反右英雄的姿态出现，利用窃取的党政大权，对“二流堂”千方百计进行包庇，演了一场牺牲车马，保存将帅的丑剧。他忍痛割爱抛出了“二流堂”的第二代“小家族”，并搭陪上几个“二流堂”的显眼分子，却把他自己和“二流堂”的实力保存起来，以图重振旗鼓，东山再起。在“批判”吴祖光的会上，他说什么“这两年来，来往少了，有事也很少和我来商量了”，说他因为“温情主义和过分的爱护”，被吴祖光“蒙蔽”了，这真是天大的谎话！头子滑过去以后，他又伙同陆定一、周扬、田汉，让那些未被揪出的“二流堂”成员与密友以“左派”面目出现，在批判会上出头露面，假批判一番，演了一场周瑜打黄盖的丑剧。在批判右派分子吴祖光的前一天晚上，田汉用轿车把吴祖光接到家中，早在那里等候的周扬对其百般抚慰，说什么“明天……就要开你的大会，你过去没有参加什么政治斗争，缺少政治斗争的经验，所以约你来谈谈。”“你应当有精神准备，多么难听的话都要听下去”等等。谈完之后，周扬亲自用小汽车送吴祖光回到家中，才放心地离去。看，周扬、夏衍之流的爱憎是何等的强烈，他们的反动立场又何等鲜明！
    反右斗争之后，“二流堂”被揪出的右派分子大都劳动改造去了。反革命修正主义分子夏衍对他们仍然是一往情深，耿耿于怀。当这些右派分子陆续回到北京后，夏衍便利用职权，一个个给他们摘了帽子，安排到文艺界各个岗位上，同他们恢复了过去的交往。一九六二年，当被罢了官的“海瑞”在舞台上复活，全国刮起了一股翻案风的时候，夏衍又和“二流堂”的骨干一起，开始反攻倒算了。“二流堂”中那些被揪出的右派分子闹着要翻案，夏衍就为他们出谋划策，叫他们“写一写材料”。直到这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的前夕，他们还疯狂地诋毁江青同志亲自领导的具有划时代意义的京剧革命，死命地对抗毛主席关于文学艺术的两个极其重要的批示，做一番最后的挣扎。
    列宁指出：“旧社会灭亡的时候，它的死尸是不能装进棺材、埋入坟墓的。它在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们。”“二流堂”就是这样一个旧社会遗留下来的散发着臭气、毒害人民的阴暗巢穴。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底捣毁反革命裴多菲俱乐部“二流堂”，彻底批判“二流堂”的黑主帅夏衍及其总后台中国赫鲁晓夫！
