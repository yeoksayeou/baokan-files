    A Sentence Radiating the Brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought
    Soldier of the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Gao Xingzeng

    "Don't worry about me! Save the Red Guards first!" This is what our excellent squad leader Li Wenzhong comrade said to the soldier Yu Dexiang, who rushed to save him, when he was exhausted while rescuing the young Red Guards in the turbulent waters of the Ganjiang River. This was also the last sentence of his brilliant life.

    "Don't worry about me!" This sentence expresses the noble qualities of a revolutionary soldier: unconditional loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, deep love for the young Red Guards, and boundless enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause. This sentence, shining with the brilliance of communist thought, can only be said by someone who has established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and can only be done by someone who has cast aside the "self" and devoted themselves to the public good.

    "Don't worry about me!" Li, the squad leader, said this many times before his death! I remember during a 700-mile march in the snow, he, despite being ill, propagated Mao Zedong Thought to the community members, carried water, and swept the floor. Comrades advised him to take care of his health, and he said this sentence. During a mission to support the left, he was attacked by the class enemy and deceived by the masses. Comrades were concerned about his safety, and he said this sentence. Even on the night before his martyrdom, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw him still writing a speech for supporting the left. I advised him to rest, and he said, "To better support the left, how can I not write it well? You sleep, don't worry about me!"

    "Don't worry about me!" This sentence still echoes in my mind, encouraging me to move forward. I am determined to take Li, the squad leader, as my example, to use White's surgical knife to remove the "self" from my mind; to use Zhang's iron shovel, which burns charcoal, to build a great wall of "public good" in the depths of my soul. I want to, at the crucial moment of defending Chairman Mao, defending the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and defending the motherland, also say like Li, the squad leader, "Don't worry about me!" Before his martyrdom, Li Wenzhong wrote in the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, "Grasp the revolution, promote production. Firmly guard the production post, and prevent enemy sabotage."

    闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的一句话
    “支左爱民模范排”战士　高兴增
    “不要管我！救红卫兵要紧！”这是我们的好排长李文忠同志，在浊浪滚滚的赣江抢救红卫兵小将的战斗中，当自己精疲力竭时，对赶来抢救他的战士于德祥说的一句话。这也是他光辉的一生中最后的一句话。
    “不要管我”！这句话表达出了一个革命战士的高贵品质：对党、对毛主席无限忠诚，对红卫兵小将无比热爱，对革命事业满腔热忱。这句闪烁着共产主义思想光辉的话，只有树立起毛泽东思想绝对权威的人才能说出，只有把“私”字抛得远远的、一心为公的人才能做到。
    “不要管我”！李排长生前又何止说过一次！记得在一次风雪七百里行军途中，他带病向社员宣传毛泽东思想，为社员担水扫地，同志们劝他爱护身体，他说过这句话。在一次执行支左任务中，遭到阶级敌人煽动受蒙蔽群众的围攻，同志们担心他的安全，他说过这句话。就是在他牺牲的头天晚上，我半夜醒来，见他还在赶写支左讲话稿，劝他休息，他说：“为了更好地支持左派，不写好怎么能行？你睡吧，不要管我！”
    “不要管我”！这句话，至今还在我的脑子里回荡着，鼓励我前进。我决心以李排长为榜样，用白求恩的“手术刀”，挖掉头脑里的“私”字；用张思德烧木炭的铁铲，在灵魂深处筑起“公”字的伟大长城。我要在保卫毛主席、保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫祖国的关键时刻，也象李排长那样地回答：“不要管我！”李文忠生前在江西棉纺织印染厂写下了“抓革命，促生产。坚守生产岗位，严防敌人破坏。”
