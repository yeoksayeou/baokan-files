The Birth of the "Little Pagoda"

	The educational system must be shortened, education must be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools must no longer continue.

	Mao Zedong

	In 1958, Chairman Mao put forward the great policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, a vast number of revolutionary teachers and students emphasized proletarian politics and combined with the workers and peasants, launching a magnificent educational revolution that powerfully impacted the old educational system.

	Facing this educational revolution, the biggest handful of capitalist roaders within the Party were terrified and enraged, strenuously resisting and opposing it. In 1959, China's Khrushchev personally came out, issuing the black directive to "study seriously." Lu Dingyi brazenly attacked the educational revolution, claiming it caused "quality to universally decline," and demanded to "establish a batch of good schools." In 1961, another major capitalist roader within the Party shouted, "With key schools, there is hope. Primary, secondary, and tertiary education must form a 'little pagoda' shape." Some counter-revolutionary revisionists who had usurped leadership positions in the educational sector also clamored: "The 'little pagoda' is the backbone of ordinary schools, the fundamental construction of the educational cause. 'Talk less about universal education, talk more about raising standards. We must grasp the key points, vigorously raise standards, and establish a batch of key schools at all levels from primary to tertiary education, focusing on improving quality,' and so on."

	In December 1962, they officially issued a "notice" to various provinces and municipalities, requiring them to immediately select a batch of primary, secondary, and tertiary schools as key schools, establishing the revisionist educational "little pagoda" system.

	The handful of capitalist roaders within the educational sector of Shandong Province received the "notice" and immediately actively implemented it. In May 1963, they specially convened a meeting of prefecture-level education bureau directors, drafting a plan to establish the "little pagoda" and setting standards for "little pagoda" schools. According to these standards, they selected a batch of schools: 235 secondary schools, accounting for 25% of the total number of full-time secondary schools; 1,472 primary schools, accounting for 31% of the total number of full-time primary schools. Among these schools, they further selected 36 secondary schools and 162 primary schools as the so-called "elite schools" to be prioritized for improvement.

The Reactionary Essence of the "Little Pagoda"

	In May 1958, China's Khrushchev said: "Our country should have two main types of school education systems... one is the current full-time school education system, where primary, secondary, and tertiary schools are all about studying all day... the other is a half-work, half-study school education system." He also said: "The outstanding ones go to the first type of school, the slightly less outstanding go to the second type of school. 'Who is outstanding, the state will cultivate them.' This is essentially the capitalist educational dual-track system. The revisionist educational "little pagoda" system is based on this. Lu Dingyi had repeatedly shouted: "We must establish state-run full-time primary and secondary schools. This is like a pagoda, gradually ascending to higher education to cultivate various experts." He also said: full-time primary and secondary schools "should have a dual mission, ascending to heaven and descending to earth, ascending to heaven is the main task, descending to earth is to handle problems." From this, it is not difficult to see that their purpose in implementing the "little pagoda" system in full-time primary and secondary schools is to concentrate manpower and resources to improve a batch of schools, intensively cultivate students with "outstanding" performance, and let them ascend level by level to become spiritual aristocrats standing above the laboring people, becoming the successors of the bourgeoisie. This is the cultivation goal they set for "little pagoda" schools. As for the general full-time primary and secondary schools, they consider them dispensable. The so-called "unqualified" graduates from these schools can only serve as "reserve labor force."

	The handful of capitalist roaders within the educational sector meticulously created two types of teaching plans for full-time primary and secondary schools. The first type of teaching plan is for "little pagoda" schools. The annual teaching time for secondary schools is not less than nine months, and for primary schools, not less than nine and a half months; secondary schools have one month of labor per year, and primary schools have half a month of labor per year. This little labor time is actually only used for cleaning the environment. The second type of teaching plan is for general full-time primary and secondary schools. The annual teaching time is reduced by one month, the curriculum is relatively less, and the teaching requirements are also relatively low, with no foreign language courses. However, many "elite universities" do not admit students who fail in foreign language courses. Thus, full-time primary and secondary schools are artificially divided into two types of schools: the main task of "little pagoda" schools is to "cultivate qualified new students for higher-level schools," letting them "ascend to heaven"; the graduates of general full-time primary and secondary schools, if they cannot enter schools, become "reserve labor force."

	To ensure that "little pagoda" schools implement the first type of teaching plan, they made special regulations for enrollment, cadre and teacher allocation, school building construction, as well as the distribution of funds and equipment.

	The handful of capitalist roaders within the educational sector of Shandong Province did not hesitate to use a large amount of state funds to renovate key schools. For example, they demolished the classrooms of a key school and rebuilt them into two-story and three-story buildings; they tore down the walls and built brick walls and iron gates; they replaced the desks and chairs used for less than a year with iron-framed desks and chairs; the classrooms had Soviet-style podiums, glass blackboards, and six fluorescent lights. Just to renovate such a key school, they spent over 200,000 yuan.

	The Serious Consequences

	The "little pagoda" system concocted by China's Khrushchev and his henchmen has caused incalculable damage to China's socialist revolutionary cause.

	First, it widened the gap between mental and physical labor.

	"Little pagoda" schools vigorously obstructed students from participating in the three great revolutionary movements, tightly tying students to schools with superior material conditions to study indoors, allowing students to ascend from primary school to secondary school to tertiary school, climbing to the top of the pagoda to become spiritual aristocrats. While the vast majority of workers' and peasants' children had to enter schools with poor equipment, being trained to have only basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills to work in the fields. When peddling the "little pagoda," Lu Dingyi once said quite blatantly: "The gap between mental and physical labor will exist for a long time. As long as the gap exists, the 'little pagoda' will exist." This fully exposed their purpose in vigorously promoting the "little pagoda," which is to maintain and widen the gap between mental and physical labor, creating conditions for the restoration of capitalism.

	Second, it established the position of bourgeois intellectuals dominating schools.

	China's Khrushchev and his henchmen opposed political leadership and implemented business leadership. They selected the leaders of "little pagoda" schools based on the standard of: "being able to personally oversee the teaching frontline, taking off shoes to work in the fields, implementing field command, preferably being able to teach a course, being familiar with teaching business, exploring work laws, gradually turning outsiders into insiders, becoming experts." They selected teachers based on the standard of: "long teaching experience, high academic qualifications, rich cultural and scientific knowledge, having specialties, solid foundation, having teaching experience, high teaching quality, good results, preferably having a few top teachers (authorities) in the region." They only looked at "business" level and did not consider political conditions. Thus, some untransformed bourgeois intellectuals usurped the leadership of schools.

	Third, it pushed young students into the quagmire of revisionism.

	Chairman Mao taught us: "Without correct political views, it is like having no soul." However, China's Khrushchev and his henchmen, through the "little pagoda" schools they controlled, crazily opposed Chairman Mao's teachings, using extremely decadent individualism to corrupt and poison the younger generation, leading young students down the path of being "expert but not red."

	Some key schools even held what they called "tradition return days," inviting graduates who entered "elite universities" and those who became cadres, engineers, etc. after graduating from university to return to the school for a reunion, treating them as "guests of honor," and urging current students to learn from these old alumni, which had a very bad influence.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao cares deeply about the physical health of students and has issued many important directives. However, China's Khrushchev and his henchmen piled heavy academic burdens on students, causing the physical health of many students to be seriously damaged.

	To cultivate and foster millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, we must thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, thoroughly smash the revisionist educational "little pagoda" system, and turn our schools into red Mao Zedong Thought schools.

　　摧毁修正主义教育的“小宝塔”制
　　山东省教育厅革命造反指挥部
　　“小宝塔”的出笼
    学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。
　　毛泽东
    一九五八年，毛主席提出了“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的伟大方针。在毛主席无产阶级教育路线的指引下，广大革命师生突出无产阶级政治，和工农群众相结合，掀起了一场轰轰烈烈的教育革命，猛烈地冲击着旧的教育制度。
    面对着这场教育革命，党内最大的一小撮走资派吓得要死，恨得要命，极力抵制和反对。一九五九年，中国赫鲁晓夫亲自跳了出来，发出“要认真读书”的黑指示。陆定一猖狂地攻击教育革命使“质量普遍下降”，叫嚷要“办好一批学校”。一九六一年，党内另一个最大的走资派叫嚷什么“有了重点学校就有了希望，大、中、小要形成小宝塔形”。窃取教育界领导岗位的一些反革命修正主义分子也纷纷鼓吹：“小宝塔是普通学校的骨干，教育事业的基本建设。”“少谈点普及，多谈点提高，必须掌握重点，大力提高，大、中、小学都要办好一批重点学校，着重提高质量”，等等。
    一九六二年十二月，他们就正式向各省、市发出“通知”，要求各省、市立即选定一批大、中、小学作为重点学校，建立修正主义教育的“小宝塔”制。
    山东省教育界党内一小撮走资派接到“通知”，立即积极贯彻执行。一九六三年五月，他们专门召开了专署文教局长会议，炮制了建立“小宝塔”的规划，制定了“小宝塔”学校的标准。他们按照这个标准挑选了一批学校：中学二百三十五所，占全日制中学总数的百分之二十五；小学一千四百七十二所，占全日制小学总数的百分之三十一。在上述学校中，又精选中学三十六所、小学一百六十二所，作为首先集中力量办好的所谓“尖子学校”。
    “小宝塔”的反动实质
    一九五八年五月，中国赫鲁晓夫说：“我们国家应该有两种主要的学校教育制度……一种是现在的全日制学校教育制度，小学、中学、大学整天都是读书，……一种是半工半读的学校教育制度。”又说：“优秀的考上了第一类学校，比较次一些考上了第二类学校。”“谁优秀，国家就培养谁。”这实质上就是资本主义教育的双轨制。修正主义教育的“小宝塔”制，就是以此为根据的。陆定一曾不止一次地叫嚷：“要搞国家办的全日制中小学。这象宝塔一样，逐步升到高等学校去，培养各种专家。”又说：全日制中小学“应是双重任务，上天入地，上天是主要的，入地是处理问题”。这就不难看出，他们在全日制中小学搞“小宝塔”的目的，就是要集中人力物力办好一批学校，对成绩“优秀”的学生加强培养，让他们一级一级升上去，让他们“上天”，成为高踞于劳动人民之上的精神贵族，成为资产阶级接班人。这就是他们为“小宝塔”学校所规定的培养目标。至于一般全日制中小学，他们则认为可有可无，这些学校毕业的所谓“不合格”的学生，只能充当“劳动后备力量”。
    教育界党内一小撮走资派煞费苦心地为全日制中小学炮制了两类教学计划。第一类教学计划是供“小宝塔”学校用的。全年教学时间，中学不得少于九个月，小学不得少于九个半月；中学全年劳动一个月，小学全年劳动半个月。这一点劳动时间，实际上只能用于打扫环境。第二类教学计划是供一般全日制中小学用的。全年教学时间减少一个月，课程比较少，教学要求也比较低，并规定不开设外语课，而不少“名牌大学”对外语不及格的考生是不予录取的。这样，全日制中小学就被人为地分成两种不同的学校：“小宝塔”学校的主要任务是“为高一级学校培养合格的新生”，让他们“上天”；一般全日制中小学的毕业生考不上学校，就成为“劳动后备力量”。
    为了保证“小宝塔”学校实现第一类教学计划，他们对招生、干部和教员配备、校舍修建以及经费、设备的分配等，都做了特殊的规定。
    山东省教育界党内的走资派不惜动用国家大量资金，改建重点学校。例如他们把一所重点学校的平房教室拆掉，改建成两层、三层楼房；把院墙扒掉，修建花墙、铁门；把刚刚用了不到一年的桌椅拨给其他学校，换上铁架桌椅；教室里是苏式讲台，玻璃黑板，六只日光灯。光改建这样一所重点学校，就花了二十余万元。
    严重的后果
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙们所炮制的“小宝塔”制，给我国社会主义革命事业造成不可估量的损失。
    一、扩大了脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。
    “小宝塔”学校极力阻挠学生参加三大革命运动，把学生紧紧拴在物质条件优越的学校里闭门读书，让学生由小学而中学而大学，爬上宝塔尖，成为精神贵族。而广大工农子女则不得不进入设备简陋的学校，被训练成为只有初步读写算能力的做工、种地的劳动力。陆定一在兜售“小宝塔”时曾非常露骨地说：“脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别还会长期存在，一天差别存在，一天就有小宝塔。”这就充分暴露了他们大搞“小宝塔”的目的，是要维持和扩大脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，为复辟资本主义创造条件。
    二、确立了资产阶级知识分子统治学校的地位。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙们反对政治挂帅，实行业务挂帅。他们挑选“小宝塔”学校领导干部的标准是：“能亲临教学第一线，脱鞋下田，实行田间指挥，最好能教一门课，能熟悉教学业务，摸索工作规律，逐步变外行为内行，成为专家。”挑选教师规定的标准是：“教龄长，学历高，文化科学知识丰富，有专长，基本功过硬，有教学经验，教学质量高，效果好，最好有几个本地区拔尖的教师（权威）。”他们只看“业务”水平，而不看政治条件。这样，一些未得到改造的资产阶级知识分子就篡夺了学校的领导权。
    三、把青少年学生推向修正主义的泥坑。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙们通过他们控制的“小宝塔”学校，疯狂地反对毛主席的教导，以极端腐朽的个人主义腐蚀毒害青少年一代，把青少年学生引向只专不红的道路。
    有的重点学校还搞什么“传统返校日”，邀请考入“名牌大学”的毕业生和大学毕业后当上干部、工程师等的校友返校欢聚，把他们待为“上宾”，并号召在校同学向这些老校友学习，起了很坏的影响。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席对学生的身体健康十分关怀，作过多次重要指示。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙们却以繁重的课业负担强压在学生的头上，使不少学生的身体健康受到严重的损害。
    为了培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人，我们必须彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，彻底粉碎修正主义教育的“小宝塔”制，把我们的学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
