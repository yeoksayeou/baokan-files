Two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each should engage in more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences.

Strive to Run Good Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes

Currently, the nationwide movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is surging ahead vigorously. Factories, rural areas, military units, government agencies, schools, and neighborhoods across the country have all extensively established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, significantly promoting the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is an important sign that the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is getting better and better.

It is a new and significant political innovation created by the revolutionary masses of our country for the two factions or various revolutionary mass organizations to jointly hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. It helps old cadres, new cadres, revolutionary youngsters, and the broad revolutionary masses to, in the practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, use "criticizing oneself and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and educate themselves through the masses. It is a good way to promote revolutionary great unity, consolidate the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and strengthen the relationship between superiors and subordinates.

Many advanced units across the country have created many good experiences on how to run good Mao Zedong Thought study classes. One very important point is: to run good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, it is necessary to establish the good study style of Marxism-Leninism advocated by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The issue of study style is an issue of the thought method of leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members; it is an issue of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism; it is an issue of the work attitude of all comrades in the Party. Since it is like this, the issue of study style is a very important issue, it is the first important issue."

The most important aspect of a revolutionary good study style is to combine theory with practice. To run a good study class, one must use Chairman Mao's "Old Five Articles" and his latest instructions as ideological weapons, and use Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as a guide, to solve the problem of revolutionary great unity, solve the problem of the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and vigorously promote the great criticism and the reform of the unit.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be seriously implemented, ensuring that every point is implemented and every sentence is followed, combining learning with application, and seeing immediate results. This is an issue of attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, and a basic quality that a genuine proletarian revolutionary must possess. Learning without applying, talking without doing, is completely wrong.

Another important aspect of establishing a revolutionary good study style is to conduct serious self-criticism.

Chairman Mao said in his five criteria for revolutionary successors: "One must make self-criticism when one has made mistakes." "One should not always think that one is right, as if all truth is in one's hands. One should not always think that only one is capable, and others are incapable, as if the world would not turn without one." These words are so profound and sincere! Aren't they exactly hitting the nail on the head of some leaders in our revolutionary organizations?

Chairman Mao recently also instructed us: "The two factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each should engage in more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences."

In the great storms of class struggle, it is inevitable that some comrades will have some shortcomings and mistakes. When there are shortcomings and mistakes, one should conduct self-criticism and correct them seriously. Voluntarily correcting mistakes is one of the characteristics of a genuine proletarian revolutionary. To attribute merits to oneself and push mistakes onto others is a corrupt bourgeois style. It is inevitable that there will be setbacks in the revolutionary movement. The two revolutionary mass organizations should summarize experiences and learn lessons from the twists and turns that have occurred in the Cultural Revolution over the past year, and should not endlessly pursue each other's responsibilities. Only in this way can it be beneficial to revolutionary great unity and to jointly fight against the enemy.

To carry out serious rather than perfunctory self-criticism is not easy. To criticize oneself, one must be self-aware and proactive. One must not gloss over one's own mistakes lightly and cover up one's faults, while pouring out a torrent of criticism on others and exaggerating their mistakes.

Cadres and masses learning together, military cadres and soldiers learning together, inspiring and helping each other, teaching and learning from each other, is also a revolutionary good study style that we should establish.

Cadres and masses fighting against selfishness and revisionism together, exposing their thoughts to the masses, seeking the masses' help, and drawing nourishment from the masses, is an important measure to strengthen the relationship between superiors and subordinates and promote the revolutionization of cadres' thinking. The masses should view revolutionary cadres dialectically, enthusiastically help cadres, and also learn from their advantages and strengths. Efforts should be made to help more revolutionary cadres come forward and participate in the leading cadres of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Using the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao to run good Mao Zedong Thought study classes will have an extremely profound impact on further organizing and educating our class ranks and promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

All regions, all departments, and all units must carry forward the revolutionary good study style, strive to run good Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and continue to launch a larger-scale movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country. This is the fundamental guarantee for achieving an all-around victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the coming new year.

### 大力办好毛泽东思想学习班

    两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。						毛泽东
    大力办好毛泽东思想学习班
    当前，全国人民群众活学活用毛主席著作的运动，正在掀起蓬蓬勃勃的高潮。各地的工厂、农村、部队、机关、学校、街道，都普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班，大大推动了无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展。这是我国无产阶级文化大革命形势越来越好的一个重要标志。
    两派或各派革命群众组织一起，联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，是我国革命群众创造的具有伟大政治意义的新事物。它是帮助老干部、新干部、革命小将和广大革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛泽东思想，群众自己教育自己的好形式，是推动革命的大联合，巩固革命的三结合，密切上下级关系的好办法。
    如何办好毛泽东思想学习班，全国许多先进单位已经创造了不少好经验。其中很重要的一条是：办好毛泽东思想学习班，必须建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风。
    毛主席教导我们：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”
    革命的好学风，最重要的，是理论联系实际。办好学习班，就是要以毛主席的“老五篇”和最新指示为思想武器，以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为指针，解决革命大联合的问题，解决革命三结合的问题，有力地推动革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。
    毛主席的最新指示，一定要认真执行，做到条条落实，句句照办，学用结合，立竿见影。这是对待毛泽东思想的态度问题，是一个真正的无产阶级革命派必须具备的基本品质。学了不用，说了不做，是完全错误的。
    建立革命好学风的另一个重要方面，是进行认真的自我批评。
    毛主席在关于革命接班人的五条标准中说过：“自己有了错误，要作自我批评。”“不要总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里。不要总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了。”这些话说得多么深刻、多么恳切啊！这岂不是切中我们革命组织中一部分负责人的要害吗？
    毛主席最近还指示我们：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，我们有些同志，出现了一些缺点、错误，往往是难免的。有了缺点、错误，就应该进行自我批评，认真改正。自觉地改正错误，是真正的无产阶级革命派的标志之一。把功劳归于自己，把错误推给别人，则是腐朽的资产阶级作风。革命运动中出现反复，是不可避免的现象。两派革命群众组织之间，对于一年多来文化大革命中出现的某些曲折，要总结经验，吸取教训，而不要彼此无休止地追究对方的责任。这样，才有利于革命的大联合，有利于共同对敌。
    实行认真的而不是敷衍的自我批评，是很不容易的。斗自己头脑中的私，要自觉，要主动。决不能对自己轻描淡写，文过饰非，而对别人倾盆大雨，无限上纲。
    干部、群众一起学习，军队的干部、战士一起学习，互相启发，互相帮助，互教互学，这也是我们要建立的革命好学风。
    干部和群众一道斗私，批修，把自己的思想同群众见面，取得群众的帮助，从群众中吸取营养，这是密切上下级关系，促进干部思想革命化的一项重要措施。群众看革命干部要一分为二，要热情帮助干部，也要学习他们的优点、长处。要努力帮助更多的革命干部站出来，参加革命三结合的领导班子。
    用毛主席提倡的革命学风，办好毛泽东思想学习班，对于进一步组织和教育我们的阶级队伍，推进无产阶级文化大革命，将产生极深远的作用。
    一切地区、一切部门、一切单位，都要发扬革命的好学风，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，在全党、全军、全国继续掀起一个更大规模的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。这是在即将到来的新的一年里，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的最根本的保证。
