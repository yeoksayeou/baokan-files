The two friendly delegations sent by the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association have completed their visits to eight Arab countries and recently returned to Beijing by plane. The two delegations departed in October for the Middle East and North Africa, visiting Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Algeria, Sudan, Iraq, Kuwait, and Morocco.

The delegations conducted their visits amidst a favorable global revolutionary situation, particularly with the escalating struggle of the Arab people against U.S.-Israeli aggression. The delegations conveyed to the journalists, students, people of various strata, and representatives of Asian-African national liberation organizations in these countries the firm stance of the Asian-African Journalists Association in supporting the just struggle of the Arab people. They exposed the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique on the Middle East issue. The delegations also introduced the resolutions of the fifth plenary meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association held in Beijing in June this year, reaffirming the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary line of the Asian-African Journalists Association, and emphasizing that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle and the sharpest weapon for the revolutionary struggles of the Asian-African people and people of the world. The delegations also highly praised the great international significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.
