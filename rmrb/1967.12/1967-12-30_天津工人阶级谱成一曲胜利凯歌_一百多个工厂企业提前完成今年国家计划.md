Tianjin's working class, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," has seen over a hundred factories and enterprises producing paper, diesel engines, paint, medical equipment, plastic products, glass products, leather, dyed cloth, sackcloth, and ink, complete their national production plans ahead of schedule. This is a triumphant march composed by Tianjin's working class, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment in the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

These factories' completion of their national plans ahead of schedule is the result of the broad revolutionary masses following Chairman Mao's directive that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," using revolution to lead production. Most of these factories have already achieved revolutionary great unity, and many have achieved revolutionary three-in-one combinations. They have deeply carried out revolutionary criticism and reform within their units, mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses, and established a new revolutionary order. The revolutionary masses of the Tianjin Hemp Textile Factory achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations relatively early. The entire factory's revolutionary workers focused on revolution and vigorously promoted production, exceeding production plans month after month and continuously creating the highest production levels in history.

A ship needs a helmsman to navigate, and revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. These factories and enterprises have all launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, established many Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and seriously carried out the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, with remarkable effects. Many veteran workers say: Chairman Mao's books are the lifeblood of our working class. After studying Chairman Mao's books, we feel we have boundless energy. Factories like the Tianjin Paper Mill, the Fifth Paper Mill, and the Tianjin First Printing Plant, which produce paper for printing Chairman Mao's works and the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," have all completed their annual tasks ahead of schedule with the greatest enthusiasm, highest standards, best quality, and fastest speed. The Tianjin Paint Factory this year completed the production of paint for Chairman Mao's badges, increasing the amount by tenfold compared to last year.

The broad revolutionary masses of these factories firmly carry out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," insist on eight-hour production, and insist on revolutionary activities in their spare time. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they have voluntarily established revolutionary labor discipline, further strengthening the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. They have also used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to break through the shackles set by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and reactionary technological "authorities" that restrict the enthusiasm of the workers, vigorously promoting technological innovation. The repair workers and technical personnel of the Yongge Wireless Factory together carried out technological innovation, manufacturing six automated machine tools themselves, increasing product varieties by onefold and production by 60%. The broad masses of workers vigorously promoting technological innovation played a significant role in completing this year's national plan ahead of schedule.

    天津工人阶级谱成一曲胜利凯歌
    一百多个工厂企业提前完成今年国家计划
    新华社天津二十八日电　在伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针指引下，天津市生产纸张、柴油机、油漆、医疗器械、塑料制品、玻璃制品、皮革、印染布、麻袋、油墨等产品的一百多个工厂企业，提前完成了今年的国家计划。这是在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，天津的工人阶级，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，谱成的又一曲胜利凯歌。
    这批工厂提前完成国家计划，是广大革命职工遵照毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，用革命统帅生产的结果。这些工厂大部分都已实现革命的大联合，有不少工厂实现了革命三结合，深入开展了革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，调动了广大革命职工的积极性，建立了革命的新秩序。天津麻纺织厂的无产阶级革命派，比较早地实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，全厂革命职工狠抓革命，猛促生产，月月超额完成生产计划，连续创造了历史上最高的生产水平。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。这批工厂企业都掀起了活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的高潮，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真开展了斗私批修，效果显著。许多老工人说：毛主席的书是我们工人阶级的命根子，学了毛主席的书，就觉得全身有使不完的力气。生产印制毛主席著作用纸的天津造纸总厂、第五造纸厂和印制《毛泽东选集》的天津第一印刷厂等，工人们都以最大的热情、最高的标准、最好的质量、最快的速度提前完成了全年的任务。天津油漆厂今年完成的制作毛主席像章用漆的数量，比去年增加十倍。
    这批工厂的广大革命职工坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚持八小时生产，坚持业余闹革命。在毛泽东思想的指导下，自觉地建立起革命的劳动纪律，进一步加强了无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。他们还用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，冲破了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动技术“权威”设置的束缚工人积极性的罗网，大闹技术革新。永革无线电厂的保全工人和技术人员一起搞技术革新，自己制造了六台自动化机床，产品品种增加了一倍，产量增长百分之六十。广大职工大闹技术革新，对提前完成今年国家计划起了很大的作用。
