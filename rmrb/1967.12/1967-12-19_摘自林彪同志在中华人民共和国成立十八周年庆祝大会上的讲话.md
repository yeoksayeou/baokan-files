We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, taking the four characters "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the self" as our guideline, to strengthen ideological education for military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards. We must establish various study classes, with the central authorities organizing them, local authorities organizing them, and all revolutionary mass organizations also able to organize them, transforming the entire country into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　摘自林彪同志在中华人民共和国成立十八周年庆祝大会上的讲话
　　我们要响应毛主席的伟大号召，用“斗私，批修”这四个字为纲，加强对军队干部、地方干部和红卫兵的思想教育。要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
