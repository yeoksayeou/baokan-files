Under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, after more than a year of intense and fierce class struggle, the situation of the Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production in Guangdong Province is better than ever, better than at any other time, and getting better and better.

The masses of the people throughout the province have been fully mobilized. From the foot of the Five Ridges to the top of the Five-Finger Mountain, from the Chaozhou Plain to the Leizhou Peninsula, from cities to rural areas, the entire province is resounding with the voices denouncing the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu, as well as their agents in Guangdong Province. Everywhere, people are discussing the Cultural Revolution, and men, women, old, and young are all concerned about national affairs. A vast revolutionary army, with workers, peasants, and soldiers as its main force, with great revolutionary spirit and heroic courage, has smashed the bourgeois reactionary line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu and their agents in the Guangdong region, and has exposed the handful of capitalist roaders who have infiltrated the party in Guangdong. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved decisive victory.

Guangdong is one of the important provinces where the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The revolutionary masses throughout the province have an irreconcilable grudge against them and hate them to the core. Currently, in every factory, rural area, school, organization, and military unit throughout the province, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. People are denouncing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu and their agents in Guangdong, and are closely linking the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units.

As the Cultural Revolution deepens, an unprecedented wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has swept across the cities and countryside of the entire province. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has never been so deeply rooted in people's hearts. After Vice Chairman Lin issued the call to action to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the entire province quickly established tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in a short period of time. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, in the study classes, with "fighting the self and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as weapons, have thoroughly smashed the bourgeois worldview and established the proletarian worldview, greatly promoting the development of the revolution and production, and raising the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's latest instruction has greatly encouraged the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in Guangdong Province. Various revolutionary mass organizations are following the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao and are rapidly advancing the great unity of the revolution. The workers of Guangzhou, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, are taking the lead. After the two revolutionary mass organizations of Guangzhou dock workers achieved revolutionary great unity, the three major worker organizations in the city have also united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and established the Guangzhou Workers' Revolutionary Great Unity Preparatory Committee. Now, about 70-80% of the factories and enterprises in the city have achieved revolutionary great unity. Mass organizations on other fronts are also gradually achieving revolutionary great unity by system, industry, and class. A large number of universities, colleges, and middle schools have resumed classes and made revolution. Primary schools have basically resumed classes. Workers, peasants, students, and cadre in various districts and counties are also advancing along the direction of revolutionary great unity with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." Revolutionary three-in-one combinations are also developing steadily.

The Cultural Revolution has powerfully promoted the development of various undertakings. On the agricultural production front, the poor and lower-middle peasants have overcome droughts, floods, and typhoons, and after achieving six consecutive years of bumper harvests in the province, they have also achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries this year. Early rice has seen a significant increase in yield, and late rice has also been harvested. The industrial production situation is also good. The revolutionary masses of workers have fully played the role of masters, using every means to increase labor productivity, and the output and quality of products have been rising. Ninety-nine types of industrial products have increased in output compared to the same period last year, and many products have exceeded the plan. The increase in industrial and agricultural production has provided the market with sufficient goods. Now the market in the entire province is bustling.

After more than a year of tempering through the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary vigilance of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in Guangdong has been heightened, and their awareness of the enemy has been strengthened. The people of the entire province are determined to be a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and to be a strong rear guard for the struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong against British aggression and violence.

The heroic soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangzhou have resolutely responded to the battle call of the great commander Chairman Mao, excellently fulfilling the glorious tasks of defending national defense, defending the Cultural Revolution, and "supporting, assisting, and participating in." In the long-term joint struggle, the military and the people have forged a deep combat friendship. The military loves the people, and the people support the military. The military and the people are united as one, jointly opposing the enemy, and have built an iron Great Wall on the coast of the South China Sea.

    在毛泽东思想指引下，广大群众精神振奋斗志昂扬
    广东革命和生产形势空前大好
    据新华社广州一日电  在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指引下，经过一年多来尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争，广东省无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产的形势空前大好，比以往任何时候都好，而且越来越好。
    全省人民群众已经充分发动起来。从五岭脚下到五指山上，从潮汕平原到雷州半岛，从城市到农村，全省到处都响彻着声讨中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸以及他们在广东省的代理人的声音，到处都在讨论无产阶级文化大革命，男女老少都在关心国家大事。一支以工农兵为主体的浩浩荡荡的革命大军，以大无畏的革命精神和英雄气概，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸以及他们在广东地区代理人所推行的资产阶级反动路线，把混进广东地区党内的一小撮走资派揪了出来，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性的胜利。
    广东是中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸推行反革命修正主义路线的重要省份之一。全省广大革命群众，同他们有着不共戴天之仇，对他们恨之入骨。目前，在全省每个工厂、农村、学校、机关和部队，到处都是革命大批判的战场，人人口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸及其在广东代理人的滔天罪行，并且把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，全省城乡掀起了空前未有的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动高潮，毛泽东思想得到了大普及、大传播；毛主席的无产阶级革命路线从来没有这样深入人心。林副主席发出了大办毛泽东思想学习班的战斗号召以后，全省短时间内就办了成千上万的毛泽东思想学习班。广大工农兵群众、红卫兵小将、革命领导干部和革命知识分子，在学习班中以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席的最新指示为武器，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，大大促进了革命和生产的发展，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到了一个崭新的阶段。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的这一最新指示，极大地鼓舞了广东省的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众。各革命群众组织紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，迅速推进了革命的大联合。具有光荣革命传统的广州工人阶级一马当先，继广州海员工人的两大派革命群众组织实现革命大联合以后，全市三大工人组织又在毛泽东思想基础上联合起来，成立了广州工人阶级革命大联合筹备委员会。现在，全市有百分之七八十的工厂企业实现了革命大联合。其他各条战线的群众组织，也正陆续按系统、按行业、按班级实现革命的大联合。一大批大、中、专学校实现了复课闹革命，小学已经基本上全面开课。各专、县的工人、农民、学生和机关干部，也正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，沿着革命大联合的方向前进。革命的三结合，也在稳步发展。
    无产阶级文化大革命有力地推动了各项事业的发展。在农业生产战线上，广大贫下中农战胜了旱涝风灾，在夺得全省农业连续六年丰收之后，今年又夺得农林牧副渔全面丰收。早稻获得了大增产，晚稻也告丰收。工业生产形势也很好。广大革命工人，充分发挥主人翁的作用，千方百计提高劳动生产率，促使产品产量和质量节节上升。有九十九种工业产品的产量比去年同期提高，很多产品超额完成了计划。工农业增产，为市场提供了充足的商品。现在全省市场一片繁荣。
    经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，广东广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，革命警惕性更加提高，敌情观念更加加强。全省人民誓作越南人民抗美救国正义斗争的坚强后盾，誓作香港爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的坚强后盾。
    英雄的人民解放军驻广州部队广大指战员，最坚决地响应伟大统帅毛主席的战斗号召，出色地担负起保卫国防、保卫文化大革命和“三支”“两军”的光荣任务。在长期的共同斗争中，军民结下了深厚的战斗友谊。军爱民，民拥军，军民团结一致，共同对敌，在祖国南海之滨筑起了一座钢铁的长城。
