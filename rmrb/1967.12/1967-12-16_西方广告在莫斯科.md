	Western Advertisements in Moscow
    A major British shoe company recently purchased one minute of airtime on Moscow television for over 700 pounds, to advertise in the Soviet Union. According to British newspapers, more British companies will soon follow suit and enter Soviet television programs.

    Colorful and bizarre commercial advertisements are a unique phenomenon of the capitalist system and a symbol of so-called "Western civilization." Moscow television has become a showcase for Western goods, actively serving Western monopolistic capital, fully exposing the extent of the degeneration of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

    Western monopolistic capital is not only pushing to sell products and infiltrate the Soviet economy but also to promote "Western civilization" and "encourage" the Soviet Union to further evolve into an "open society." The Soviet revisionist leadership is not merely serving Western commercial exports but is actively opening its doors to Western influence, importing bourgeois ideology and lifestyles to adapt to the full-scale restoration of capitalism. One wants to break in, and the other wants to let them in. Thus, Western commercial advertisements appear openly on Moscow's television screens.

    Not long ago, the Soviet revisionist group issued an outline for the "commemoration" of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, boasting that Soviet television is a means for the working people to "enjoy cultural wealth" and is an "active factor in communist education." However, the fact is that what the Soviet revisionist group wants the Soviet people to "enjoy" is Western "cultural wealth." Their so-called "communist education" is to lead the masses to wear British shoes and American coats, completely Westernizing. It is clear that the "communism" advocated by the Soviet revisionist group is nothing but pure capitalism.

    Great teacher Lenin pointed out long ago: "Capitalism is already rotten," "the collapse of capitalism is inevitable." Today, capitalism is even more rotten and emits a foul odor. Yet the Soviet revisionist group treats this rottenness as something miraculous, admiring and worshipping the capitalist system without limit. They operate various propaganda machines to promote capitalism, actively extolling the superiority of the capitalist system, promoting "Western civilization," and promoting Western lifestyles. The airing of Western commercials on Moscow television is just a small episode.

    The replacement of capitalism by socialism is an objective law of historical development. The Soviet revisionist group, by reversing this process and replacing socialism with capitalism, will only be crushed by the relentless wheels of history!

### 西方广告在莫斯科

　　西方广告在莫斯科
    英国一家最大的制鞋公司，最近以一分钟七百多英镑的代价，向莫斯科电视台购得了放映时间，在苏联大做广告。据英国报纸报道，还有更多的英国公司，也将纷纷打入苏联的电视节目。
    花花绿绿、光怪陆离的商品广告，是资本主义制度特有的现象，是所谓“西方文明”的象征。莫斯科的电视，居然成了西方商品的橱窗，积极为西方垄断资本服务，这充分表明苏修领导集团已经堕落到了何等地步。
    西方垄断资本所以要在莫斯科大做广告，不仅为了推销商品，向苏联进行经济渗透，而且为了宣扬“西方文明”，“鼓励”苏联进一步向“开放的社会演变”。苏修领导集团所以让西方垄断资本在莫斯科大做广告，也不单单是为西方的商品输出效劳，而是主动地向西方大开门户，输入西方资产阶级的意识形态和生活方式，以适应全面复辟资本主义的需要。一个想打进去，一个要请进来。于是，西方的商品广告就公然出现在莫斯科的电视屏幕上了。
    不久以前苏修集团发表的关于“纪念”十月革命五十周年的提纲，曾大肆吹嘘苏联的电视是使劳动人民“享受文化财富而广泛使用的手段”，是“共产主义教育的积极因素”。但是人们看到的事实是，苏修集团要苏联人民“享受”的原来是西方的“文化财富”，他们所谓的“共产主义教育”，原来是诱导广大人民穿英国的皮鞋，美国的大衣，彻底西方化。可见，苏修集团所标榜的“共产主义”，就是地地道道的资本主义。
    伟大导师列宁早就指出：“资本主义已经腐朽”，“资本主义的崩溃是不可避免的”。今天，资本主义更是腐烂不堪，发出了难闻的尸臭。而苏修集团却把腐臭当作神奇，对资本主义制度无限羡慕和崇拜。他们开动了各种宣传机器给资本主义大做义务宣传，积极宣扬资本主义制度的优越性，宣扬“西方文明”，宣扬西方的生活方式。莫斯科电视台放映西方的商业广告，不过是一种小插曲。
    社会主义代替资本主义，这是历史发展的客观规律。苏修集团倒行逆施，用资本主义代替社会主义，结果只会被滚滚向前的历史巨轮辗得粉碎！
