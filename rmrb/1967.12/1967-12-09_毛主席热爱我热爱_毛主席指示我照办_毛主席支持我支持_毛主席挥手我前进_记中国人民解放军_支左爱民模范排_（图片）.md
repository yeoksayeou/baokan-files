The soldiers of the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" have boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They unquestioningly believe in every great strategic deployment and every great battle order issued by Chairman Mao, carefully understand them, follow them step by step, and carry them out word for word, truly doing as Chairman Mao directs. This is the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" was fiercely loyal to Chairman Mao, never leaving his side, and made immortal contributions in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, supporting the revolutionary masses, and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. This is the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" rescuing Red Guards and revolutionary masses from the rapids of the Gan River. Eight soldiers and some of the rescued Red Guards are together.

The great communist warrior and squad leader of the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People," Li Wenzhong, wrote before his death: "Beheading is no big deal, as long as the cause is true; protecting Chairman Mao, I am willing to die." The picture on the right is Li Wenzhong's portrait. The "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" has boundless faith and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They regard it as an extremely honorable and great task of the times to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. This is Li Wenzhong (left) studying Chairman Mao's works with his comrades before his death.

The soldiers of the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the revolutionary workers of the Jiangxi Cotton Textile and Dyeing Factory use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out a revolutionary great criticism. They are determined to thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of capitalist roaders within the party headed by China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically!

Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is the greatest public good of the proletariat. The soldiers of the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" have boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao. Every soldier in the squad has a personally made "Chairman Mao Album." They collect all the photos of Chairman Mao published in newspapers and magazines into this album. These two soldiers are delighted to see the glorious image of our great leader Chairman Mao, and in their hearts, the reddest sun rises.

With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, never leaving his side. Our great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. The soldiers of the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" enthusiastically responded and took action, setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the broad revolutionary masses, using the fight against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism as the guideline, promoting the revolutionary great criticism, revolutionary great alliance, and revolutionary three-in-one combination. This is the brave soldier who rescued the fallen Red Guards and was awarded the first-class merit, the new squad leader of the Fourth Squad, Pang Chaosheng (standing in the middle), and other comrades holding a self-criticism and criticism of revisionism meeting with the revolutionary masses of the Jiangxi Cotton Textile and Dyeing Factory.

The soldiers of the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" have the firmest stand and the clearest banner. Wherever they go, they firmly support the revolutionary leftists, organize the revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's works, and promote revolution and production. The masses praise them for turning every place they pass through red. This is the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" helping with the autumn harvest in the Jiangxi Cotton Textile and Dyeing Factory.

    毛主席热爱我热爱  毛主席指示我照办  毛主席支持我支持  毛主席挥手我前进
     ——记中国人民解放军“支左爱民模范排”
     “支左爱民模范排”的战士对伟大统帅毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。毛主席的每一个伟大战略部署，每一个伟大的战斗号令，他们都坚信不疑，认真领会，步步紧跟，句句照办，真正做到了“毛主席指示我照办”。这是“支左爱民模范排”的战士在集体学习《毛主席语录》。
    “支左爱民模范排”在无产阶级文化大革命中，对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫和支持无产阶级革命派，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的斗争中，建立了不朽的功勋。这是“支左爱民模范排”在赣江激流抢教红卫兵、革命群众的八名战士和被抢救的部分红卫兵小将在一起。
    伟大的共产主义战士、“支左爱民模范排”英雄排长李文忠生前写下的誓言：“砍头不要紧，只要主义真；保卫毛主席，死了也甘心。”
    右图是李文忠同志遗像。“支左爱民模范排”对伟大统帅毛主席和毛泽东思想无限信仰、无限忠诚。他们把大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，看作是时代赋予的极其光荣而伟大的任务。这是李文忠同志（左）生前和他的战友一起学习毛主席著作。
    “支左爱民模范排”的战士和江西棉纺织印染厂的革命职工一起，以毛泽东思想为武器，开展革命的大批判。他们决心从政治上、思想上、理论上把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派彻底批倒、批臭！
    无限忠于毛主席是无产阶级最大的公。“支左爱民模范排”的战士对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，全排每一个战士都有一本自己精心制作的“毛主席影集”。他们把报刊上刊载的毛主席照片，都收集在这个影集里。这两位战士喜看我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象，心中升起了最红最红的红太阳。
    对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离。伟大领袖毛主席发出了要斗私，批修的伟大号召，“支左爱民模范排”的战士热烈响应，积极行动，同广大革命群众一起，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，以斗私，批修为纲，推动革命大批判、革命大联合和革命三结合。这是英勇抢救落水的红卫兵小将荣立一等功的新任四排排长庞朝胜（中站立者）等同志，和江西棉纺织印染厂无产阶级革命派举行斗私批修讲用会。
    “支左爱民模范排”的战士立场最坚定，旗帜最鲜明，他们走到哪里，就在哪里坚定地支持革命左派，就组织哪里的革命群众学习毛主席著作，就同哪里的革命群众一起抓革命，促生产。群众赞扬他们走过哪里红一线，住到哪里红一片。这是“支左爱民模范排”的战士在蒋巷公社帮助秋收。（本版照片均为新华社稿）
