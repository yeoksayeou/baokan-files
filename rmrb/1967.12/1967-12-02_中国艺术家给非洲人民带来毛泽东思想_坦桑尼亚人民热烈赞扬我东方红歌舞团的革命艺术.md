Chinese Artists Bring Mao Zedong Thought to African People
Tanzanian People Warmly Praise the Revolutionary Art of Our Red East Song and Dance Troupe

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe recently visited Tanzania for performances, receiving a warm welcome from Tanzanian audiences. Many spectators praised the Chinese people's revolutionary songs and dances, saying they "embodied the great thoughts of the great proletarian genius Chairman Mao Zedong," and thanked Chinese cultural workers for "bringing Mao Zedong Thought to African people through their excellent performances."

Chinese cultural workers, with a passion to serve the people of the world, endured fatigue and frequently held outdoor performances for African audiences. During their performances in Tanzania, whenever the image of the great leader Chairman Mao appeared on the stage curtain, they applauded enthusiastically. When Chinese performers sang a Tanzanian song, "What Did the Colonialists Do in Tanzania?" in Swahili, the worker audience was deeply moved. Before the performance ended, African workers who loved Chairman Mao and the Chinese people went on stage and sang a song of Mao's quotations in Chinese: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." This was met with enthusiastic applause. When the performance ended, the audience gave prolonged, enthusiastic applause and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

On the evening of November 27, the Chinese Red East Song and Dance Troupe held its first performance in Zanzibar.

Tanzania's First Vice President Karume and his wife, ministers of Zanzibar, members of the Revolutionary Council, and leaders of the Afro-Shirazi Party attended the performance.

The chairman of the reception committee, Ismail, spoke at the opening ceremony, expressing heartfelt welcome to the Chinese revolutionary artists.

The people of Zanzibar in Tanzania have boundless love for the great leader of the Chinese people and the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Mao Zedong, and his brilliant thoughts. When the red curtain revealed the golden image of Chairman Mao, the entire audience erupted in enthusiastic applause. A Zanzibari audience member who insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works said, "Chairman Mao's works are an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Chairman Mao's works encourage us to dare to struggle and dare to win." When the announcer recited Chairman Mao's famous statement, "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," an old warrior who had participated in the Zanzibar armed revolution repeatedly said, "This is the truth!"

The Chinese artists' performances in Swahili of songs such as "Drive the Colonialists Out," and "Zanzibar Youth Ready to Fight in Angola," which are anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist songs of the Zanzibari people, were met with enthusiastic applause from the Zanzibari audience.
