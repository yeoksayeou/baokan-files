	Resolutely Protest Against U.S. Imperialism's Cultural Invasion and Reject Dictatorship's Slavish Education Policy
	Brazilian Students Launch a New Wave of Anti-U.S. and Anti-Dictatorship Struggles
	The Persecution by the U.S. and Reactionaries Only Sparks Broader and More Intense Struggles Among the People

	BEIJING, Dec. 21 (New China News Agency) — Rio de Janeiro: Recently, progressive students in Brazil have been continuously staging strikes, demonstrations, and protests, strongly opposing U.S. imperialism's cultural infiltration and the dictatorship supported by the U.S., marking a new high point in their anti-U.S. struggles.

	Since late October, students in states such as Guanabara, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo, and Pernambuco have, despite the violent suppression and persecution by the reactionary military police, been shouting anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship slogans, staging strikes, demonstrations, and rallies. They are protesting against U.S. imperialism's cultural invasion and condemning the reactionary acts of the pro-U.S. dictatorship in Brazil that harm national rights and student interests.

	On October 25, over 2,000 students from the University of Rio de Janeiro gathered in the city center for a rally and demonstration. They opposed U.S. infiltration into Brazilian universities, protested the federal government's reduction of university funds and the illegal arrest of students, and demanded the guarantee of freedom of thought, speech, and association. During the demonstration, students chanted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism," "Down with the dictatorship," and "Down with the U.S.-Brazil agreement," and held up banners and placards with these slogans. The demonstrators clashed with the reactionary military police who came to suppress them. On November 9 and 13, over a thousand university students from this state stormed the Ministry of Education building for two consecutive rallies. On November 29, over 500 medical students demonstrated in front of the state legislature, protesting against U.S. imperialism's cultural invasion and opposing the federal government's harmful educational policies.

	On October 26, university students in Minas Gerais state declared an indefinite strike and held demonstrations, protesting against the pro-U.S. dictator Costa e Silva's "visit" to the state capital of Belo Horizonte and opposing the federal government's educational policies. The reactionary authorities sent a large number of military police to brutally suppress the demonstrators. Over 20 university students were illegally arrested. The student organization in this state pointed out in a statement that the execution of the U.S.-Brazil cultural agreement actually turns universities into places that serve the interests of U.S. imperialism.

	Students in states such as Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo, and Pernambuco have also recently staged multiple strikes and demonstrations, protesting against U.S. imperialism's cultural infiltration and invasion and opposing the pro-U.S. dictatorship's imperialist slavish educational policies.

	The current anti-U.S. struggles by Brazilian students are a continuation of the struggles that began in April this year against the pro-U.S. dictatorship in Brazil signing a cultural "aid" agreement with the U.S. Agency for International Development. U.S. imperialism, in collusion with the Brazilian reactionaries, has been continuously intensifying its infiltration activities in the cultural and educational sectors. Under the guise of executing the cultural "aid" agreement, it sends American "advisors" to Brazilian schools and distributes over 50 million so-called "technical textbooks" published in the U.S. to Brazilian libraries, indoctrinating students with imperialist slavish education and turning Brazilian schools into tools for U.S. imperialism's cultural invasion of Brazil.

	The Brazilian students' just struggle against U.S. imperialism is an important part of the Brazilian people's struggle for national independence and liberation and is a sign of the further development of the Brazilian people's anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship struggles. The various persecutions of the Brazilian people by U.S. imperialism and the Brazilian reactionaries can only prompt the Brazilian people to rise up in broader and more intense struggles.

    坚决抗议美帝进行文化侵略　决不许独裁政权推行奴化教育政策
    巴西学生掀起反美反独裁斗争新高潮
    美帝和反动派的迫害只能激起人民更广泛更剧烈的斗争
    新华社二十一日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西进步学生最近又不断举行罢课、游行示威，强烈抗议美帝国主义的文化渗透和美国所扶植的独裁统治，掀起了又一个反美斗争高潮。
    从十月下旬以来，瓜纳巴拉、米纳斯吉拉斯、南里约格朗德、圣保罗、伯南布哥等许多州的学生，不顾反动军警的暴力镇压和迫害，高呼反美、反独裁的口号，纷纷举行罢课、示威游行和集会，抗议美帝国主义的文化侵略行径，谴责巴西亲美独裁政权损害民族权利和学生利益的反动勾当。
    瓜纳巴拉州的里约热内卢大学两千多名学生十月二十五日在市中心举行集会和示威游行，反对美国对巴西大学的渗透活动、抗议联邦当局削减大学经费和非法逮捕学生，要求保证思想言论和结社自由。在游行示威时，学生高呼“打倒美帝国主义”、“打倒独裁统治”、“打倒巴美协定”等口号，并高举写着这些口号的标语牌和横幅。示威学生同前来镇压的反动军警展开了针锋相对的斗争。十一月九日和十三日，这个州的上千名大学生连续两次冲进教育部大楼举行示威集会。十一月二十九日，五百多名医学院学生又在州议会门前举行示威游行，抗议美帝国主义的文化侵略和反对联邦当局祸国殃民的教育政策。
    米纳斯吉拉斯州的大学生在十月二十六日全部宣布不定期罢课，举行游行示威，抗议亲美独裁者科斯塔·席尔瓦到这个州首府贝洛奥里藏特“访问”，反对联邦当局的教育政策。反动当局出动大批军警对示威学生进行残酷的镇压。二十多名大学生被非法逮捕。这个州的学生组织在声明中指出：巴美文化协定的执行，实际上是把大学变成专门为美帝国主义利益服务的场所。
    南里约格朗德、圣保罗、伯南布哥等州的学生最近以来也先后多次举行罢课、示威游行，抗议美帝国主义的文化渗透和侵略活动，反对亲美独裁政权推行的帝国主义奴化教育政策。
    巴西学生目前的反美斗争，是今年四月开始的反对巴西亲美独裁政权同美国国际开发署签订的巴美文化“援助”协定斗争的继续。美帝国主义勾结巴西反动派不断加紧对文化教育界进行渗透活动。它在所谓执行文化“援助”协定名义下，向巴西的学校派遣美国“顾问”，向巴西的图书馆散发美国出版的所谓“技术教科书”达五千多万册，对学生灌输帝国主义奴化教育，把巴西学校变成美帝国主义对巴西进行文化侵略的工具。
    巴西学生的反美正义斗争，是巴西人民争取民族独立和解放斗争的重要组成部分，是巴西人民反美反独裁斗争进一步开展的标志之一。美帝国主义和巴西反动派对巴西人民所作的种种迫害，只能促进巴西人民更广泛更剧烈地奋起斗争。
