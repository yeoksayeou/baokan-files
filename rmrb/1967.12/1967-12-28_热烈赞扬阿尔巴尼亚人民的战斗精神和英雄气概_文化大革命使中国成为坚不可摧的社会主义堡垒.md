Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, recently, while inspecting the earthquake-stricken areas, spoke at a meeting of party, government, and social organization cadres in the Debar area. He warmly praised the heroic spirit shown by the Albanian people in their struggle to eliminate the consequences of the earthquake. Comrade Hoxha also highly praised the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, which has world-historical significance, as well as the great fighting friendship between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of Albania and China.

Comrade Hoxha said, "The Debar and Librazhd areas were hit by an earthquake on November 30. We do not regard this earthquake as a misfortune but as a great test for our party, our government, and our entire people. This test has shown the fighting spirit and self-sacrificing spirit of our party and our people's power, as well as our great organizational strength."

He said, "The work done by the party and the state to eliminate the consequences of the earthquake in the Debar and Librazhd areas has been well organized. Immediately after the earthquake, party organizations and state organs established a command post in every affected village to lead the work and normalize the lives of the victims, taking all necessary measures to eliminate the consequences of the earthquake and gaining rich organizational experience in dealing with unexpected and difficult natural conditions."

Comrade Hoxha said, "We are now implementing the five-year economic plan adopted by the Fifth Party Congress. The party and the people are enthusiastically striving to fulfill this plan. The working masses are completing the tasks they have undertaken."

Comrade Hoxha pointed out, "This revolutionary spirit must be promoted immediately in our schools. Teachers must always remember the instructions of the Central Committee of the party and closely link school life with real life. Everyone in our country must learn two or three trades. Students must, while studying well, strive to learn the trades of bricklaying, plastering, carpentry, and other trades that our country urgently needs. All these trades cannot be learned in school but must be learned in life. The emergency organizations set up to eliminate the disaster caused by the earthquake in the Debar and Librazhd areas have given us profound lessons in this regard."

In discussing the decision of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania to supply electricity to all villages in Albania, Comrade Hoxha said: "We had previously made a decision on this issue, stipulating that it would be implemented by 1985, that is, in seventeen or eighteen years. However, when the Political Bureau and the government saw the incredible and indescribable enthusiasm of the party and the people, the creative efforts inspired by the decision of the Central Committee, we had to re-examine this issue, after some calculations, we finally decided to complete this task in four years." He pointed out, "The decision of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is indeed a historic event, and we must implement this decision to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of our glorious party. Implementing this decision is the cause of the party, the cause of our glorious people educated by the party."

Comrade Hoxha also discussed the issue of building housing for the working people. He emphasized that the party and the state will solve this problem with a revolutionary spirit.

In discussing the international situation, Comrade Hoxha pointed out, "Abroad, people in various places speak with respect about the People's Republic of Albania. The correct Marxist-Leninist policies pursued by the Party of Labor of Albania and the People's Republic of Albania have always defended the rights of the peoples of all countries and have mercilessly exposed the vile crimes committed by American imperialists and other imperialists, as well as Soviet revisionists, against the peoples of all countries."

Comrade Hoxha said: "Not long ago, Comrade Mehmet Shehu led a party and government delegation to visit the People's Republic of China. There, he met with Comrade Mao Zedong, other Chinese leaders, and the broad masses of the people and the party members of China, who love the Albanian people and the Party of Labor of Albania very much. I can say that this love is unimaginable. They made the revolutionary measures already taken and being continuously taken by the Albanian party and government known to every household in China. Comrade Mehmet Shehu said that as soon as our delegation went out on the streets, cars were immediately surrounded by thousands of people for several hours, all wanting to express their respect to our comrades, they joyfully cheered for Albania, expressing the true proletarian internationalist spirit fostered by the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong."

Comrade Hoxha said: "This friendship is the result of our party and state's correct line, the result of our party's iron-clad unity with the Communist Party of China and the great Comrade Mao Zedong, the result of our party's adherence to the revolutionary position, the result of our common struggle against the revisionist traitors, the result of the internationalist aid given by our two parties and two countries to revolutionary and communist friends and comrades around the world who are fighting and striking at the enemy."

In his speech, Comrade Hoxha highly praised the Chinese Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao. He said: "At present, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, which has world-historical significance, is developing victoriously. This great revolution has prevented the People's Republic of China and the socialist construction of this great country from being betrayed by the Chinese Khrushchev revisionists. The Chinese Khrushchev revisionists had infiltrated the party and government leadership organs, and for a long time, while outwardly professing to support Mao Zedong Thought, they actually used it as a cover to engage in activities against Comrade Mao Zedong, attempting to create in China the situation that has already appeared in the Soviet Union. The danger lies in the fact that the Chinese Khrushchev revisionists have their agents in the highest leadership organs of the party, government, mass organizations, youth, trade unions, and women's organizations, and they conspire with Soviet revisionists and imperialists to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat in this great socialist country and restore capitalism. Comrade Hoxha said, Comrade Mao Zedong and the true revolutionary communists in China had long since seen through this plot and were tracking and fighting against these enemies. Comrade Mao Zedong personally called on the youth, the working class, and the peasants to advance courageously in the Cultural Revolution. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, tens of millions of young men and women, workers, and peasants have risen up, engaging in this revolution aimed at thoroughly eliminating all anti-Marxist activities of the revisionist traitors, seizing power completely, and eliminating all bad elements and bad things, thus ensuring that China will never change its red color and will forever be an invincible socialist bastion."

Comrade Hoxha said: "This goal has been fully achieved. Now, the revisionist enemies in China have been overthrown. Provinces and cities are realizing the great unity of youth, workers, and other revolutionary organizations."

Comrade Hoxha said: "The victorious development of the Chinese Cultural Revolution has also made great progress in the economy. Industry has been further developed, agriculture has continued to advance, and nuclear tests have been successfully conducted one after another. China's atomic bomb has developed to such an extent that, from a military point of view, imperialists and revisionists are also terrified of the People's Republic of China, mainly because the Chinese people are revolutionary people, and the Chinese people's army is a revolutionary army guided by Marxist-Leninist revolutionary military theory and equipped with nuclear weapons. China, due to its correct policy and the armed forces it possesses, has become an indestructible socialist country."

Comrade Hoxha pointed out: "The revolutionary movement of the peoples and communist parties of the world is surging, and therefore, imperialists are experiencing a great political, economic, and military crisis. Revisionists are also experiencing a great crisis in all respects."

He said, "American imperialism has fallen into the quagmire of the Vietnam War. Despite having sent about five hundred thousand troops there, it cannot extricate itself from the predicament created by the heroic people's war of the Vietnamese people, and thus it has suffered a disastrous defeat both militarily and politically, causing financial and economic chaos and great turmoil among the broad masses of the American people. Tens of thousands of American people have expressed their opposition to the war waged by American imperialists in Vietnam, and some have even demonstrated in front of the White House. The Vietnamese people, through their heroic struggle against American imperialism, have made this paper tiger of the Americans sink into an irredeemable great crisis."

Comrade Hoxha also discussed the crisis facing capitalist countries due to the devaluation of the pound, the weakening of the dollar's position, and the split within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He pointed out that under the impact of the surging revolutionary torrent, the crisis and serious rifts within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the economic, political, and military fields are deepening.

Comrade Hoxha said, "In the Soviet Union under the rule of the Khrushchev revisionist traitors, there is a reign of terror. As in other revisionist countries, the prisons there are full of people. Revolutionary comrades are imprisoned and killed simply because they resist the betrayal of the Khrushchev revisionists. However, the Khrushchev revisionists will never be able to crush the resistance of Marxist-Leninists."

He said, "In the Soviet Union and other countries where the revisionist clique is in power, there is serious moral, political, and economic degeneration. The Soviet Union has already formed a situation similar to that under Tito's rule in Yugoslavia, and various economic organizations and management institutions have been established according to capitalist methods."

Comrade Hoxha exposed the plot and plight of the Soviet revisionist leadership, who succeeded Khrushchev, to convene a so-called "unification conference of the international communist movement." He pointed out that this is a conference against China and Albania, against Marxism-Leninism. However, on this issue, there is no consensus even among the leaders of various countries' revisionists, not because they like us, but because they do not want to be brought into the orbit of Soviet revisionist hegemony.

Comrade Hoxha pointed out that the anti-socialist policies pursued by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and their accomplices have caused great discontent among the people in their own countries. This is a dialectical process that is developing. This discontent is gradually and continuously accumulating, growing, and one day it will definitely explode. Comrade Hoxha stressed the need to strengthen the struggle against the revisionist traitors to ensure that the revisionist traitors are overthrown as soon as possible. He said, "Our great responsibility is to aid the brotherly peoples of various countries suffering from revisionist oppression, to work tirelessly to consolidate our party, our state, and our country's economy, to be always prepared and maintain a high degree of vigilance, to make our party, our state, and our country's economy stronger and more tempered, and to make our enemies more fearful."

Comrade Hoxha also exposed the plot of the Tito traitor clique to use the earthquake in Yugoslavia to weaken the resistance of the Albanian ethnic population within Yugoslavia. Comrade Hoxha said, "Within Albania, we rebuilt more than five thousand houses destroyed and damaged by the earthquake in twenty days; while on the other side of the border, in Yugoslavia, people not only suffered from the cold in the already begun severe winter but also had to suffer in the coming years. The Serbian and Montenegrin Titoist chauvinists did nothing to heal the wounds caused by the earthquake but used the disaster caused by the earthquake to weaken the resistance of the Albanian ethnic population. Therefore, they are desperately trying to relocate the residents of the Debar region to various parts of Yugoslavia to make the regions where Albanian ethnic people live lose their national characteristics. But they will never succeed because the Albanian ethnic people have maintained their pure national feelings, their language, their fighting traditions, and their boundless love for their homeland for centuries. They still maintain these feelings strongly. Therefore, everything the Titoists do against them is in vain." Comrade Hoxha pointed out that the Tito authorities are also trying every means to steal the aid sent by foreign countries to the earthquake victims in Yugoslavia, and they have no intention of relieving the earthquake victims. The Albanian people and the whole world are watching their heinous crimes against the victims.

    霍查同志在视察地震灾区过程中发表讲话
    热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民的战斗精神和英雄气概  文化大革命使中国成为坚不可摧的社会主义堡垒
    阿中两党两国人民钢铁般的团结体现了真正的无产阶级国际主义精神
    新华社地拉那二十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查同志最近在视察地震灾区过程中，在迪勃拉区举行的党政和社会团体干部会议上发表讲话，热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在消除地震灾害后果的斗争中所表现出的英雄气概。霍查同志还高度赞扬具有世界和历史意义的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展以及阿中两党、两国和两国人民伟大的战斗友谊。
    霍查同志说，迪勃拉区和利布拉什德区在十一月三十日遭到地震灾害，我们不把这次地震灾害看作一种不幸，而是把它看作是对我们党、我国政府和全体人民的一个大考验。这一考验证明了我们党和我国人民政权的战斗精神和牺牲精神以及伟大的组织力量。
    他说，党和国家为消除迪勃拉区和利布拉什德区地震所造成的后果所进行的工作，组织得很好。各级党组织和国家机关在地震发生之后，立即在每个受灾的村设立一个指挥部以领导工作和使灾民生活正常化，采取了一切必要措施以消除地震的后果，并从中取得了应付意外和困难的自然条件的丰富的组织工作经验。
    霍查同志说，我们现在正在执行党第五次代表大会所制定的五年经济计划，党和人民正在满腔热情地为实现这个计划而奋斗。劳动群众正在完成他们所承担的任务。
    霍查同志指出，必须把这种革命精神，立即在我们的学校中加以提倡。教师必须时刻牢记党中央委员会的指示，把学校和生活尽可能紧密地结合起来。我国人人都必须学会两三种手艺。学生也必须在学好功课的同时，努力学会砌砖工、抹泥工和木工的手艺，以及我国所非常需要的其他手艺。所有这些手艺不可能都在学校里学会，而是要在生活中去学。为消除迪勃拉区和利布拉什德区地震所造成的灾害而设立的这些应急组织，使我们在这方面受到意义深远的教益。
    霍查同志在谈到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第四次全体会议关于向阿尔巴尼亚所有村庄供应照明用电的决议时说：我们过去曾就这个问题作过一个决定，规定在一九八五年，也就是说在十七、八年之后付诸实现。但是，当政治局和政府看到了党和人民的这股令人难以想象和无法形容的冲天干劲的时候，看到了中央委员会的决议激发起来的这种创造性努力的时候，我们不得不重新研究这个问题，经过一番计算，我们最后决定，在四年之内完成这项任务。他指出，中央委员会第四次全体会议的决议，确实是具有历史意义的大事，一定要实现这个决议，以迎接我们光荣的党的三十周年。实现这个决议，是党的事业，是受到党的教育的我国光荣人民的事业。
    霍查同志还谈到有关为劳动群众建筑住房的问题。他强调指出，党和国家将以革命精神来解决这个问题。
    霍查同志在谈到国际形势时指出，在国外，各地的人民以尊敬的心情谈论阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国奉行的马克思列宁主义正确政策始终维护世界各国人民的权利，无情地揭露美帝国主义者和其他帝国主义者以及苏联修正主义者对世界各国人民犯下的卑鄙的罪行。
    霍查同志说：穆罕默德·谢胡同志不久前率领党政代表团访问了中华人民共和国。他在那里会见了毛泽东同志、其他中国领导人，以及广大的人民群众和中国共产党的党员群众，他们十分热爱阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。我可以说，是难以想象的热爱。他们在中国各地，使阿尔巴尼亚党和政府已经采取和正在不断采取的革命化措施成为家喻户晓。穆罕默德·谢胡同志说，我国代表团一上街，汽车立即被数以千计的人围拢起来达几个小时之久，他们都要向我们的同志们表示敬意，他们兴高采烈地为阿尔巴尼亚欢呼，表达了中国共产党和毛泽东同志所培养出来的真正的无产阶级国际主义精神。
    霍查同志说：这种友谊是我们党和国家执行正确路线的结果，是我们党同中国共产党和伟大的毛泽东同志结成钢铁般的团结的结果，是我们党坚持革命立场的结果，是我们反对修正主义叛徒的共同斗争的结果，是我们两党和两国给予正在进行斗争和打击敌人的世界各地革命的、共产主义的朋友和同志以国际主义援助的结果。
    霍查同志在讲话中高度赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说：目前，具有世界意义和历史意义的中国无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利发展。这场大革命使中华人民共和国和这个伟大国家的社会主义建设免遭中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子的背叛。中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子钻入党政领导机关，长期以来，表面上也说拥护毛泽东思想，实际上是以此作为幌子，进行反对毛泽东同志的活动，企图在中国造成在苏联已经出现的那种局面。危险在于中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子在党、政、群众团体、青年、工会和妇女等组织的最高领导机关中都有他们的代理人，他们勾结苏联修正主义者和帝国主义者阴谋在这个伟大的社会主义国家摧毁中国的无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。霍查同志说，毛泽东同志以及中国真正革命的共产党人早就识破这一阴谋，并且跟踪追击，同这些敌人作斗争。毛泽东同志亲自号召青年、工人阶级和农民在无产阶级文化大革命中奋勇前进。在毛泽东同志的领导下，亿万男女青年、工人和农民起来了，他们投入了这场旨在根本消灭修正主义叛徒们的一切反马克思主义的活动的革命，彻底地把权夺过来，清除一切坏人坏事，从而使中国永不改变鲜红的颜色，永远成为坚不可摧的社会主义堡垒。
    霍查同志说：这个目的完全达到了。现在，中国的修正主义敌人已经被打倒。各省、市正在实现青年、工人和其他革命组织的大联合。
    霍查同志说：中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，同时也使经济取得了巨大进展。工业进一步得到发展，农业不断前进，一次又一次成功地进行了核试验。中国原子弹已经发展到这样的水平，以至于从军事观点来看，帝国主义者和修正主义者对中华人民共和国也怕得要死，这主要是因为中国人民是革命的人民，中国的人民军队是由马克思列宁主义的革命军事学说指引，并用原子武器装备起来的革命的军队。中国由于奉行正确的政策，由于所拥有的武装力量，已成为一个不可摧毁的社会主义国家。
    霍查同志指出：全世界人民和共产党人的革命运动在高涨，因此帝国主义者经历着一场政治、经济和军事的大危机。修正主义者也在各方面经历着一场大危机。
    他说，美帝国主义陷入了侵越战争的泥坑，尽管它已把约五十万军队派往那里，也无法摆脱越南人民的英勇人民战争使它陷入的困境，因此它在军事上和政治上都遭到了惨败，引起了财政和经济的混乱，在美国广大的人民群众中引起了极大的动荡。以数十万计的美国人民群众表示反对美帝国主义者在越南进行的战争，其中甚至有许多人到白宫前面举行示威。越南人民通过抗击美帝国主义的英勇斗争，使美帝这个泥足巨人陷进了无法补救的大危机。
    霍查同志还谈到资本主义国家由于英镑贬值、美元地位削弱和北大西洋公约组织分裂等原因而面临的危机。他指出，在日益高涨的革命洪流的冲击下，在经济、政治和军事方面，北大西洋公约组织内部的危机和严重的裂痕正在加深。
    霍查同志说，在赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒统治下的苏联，笼罩着一片恐怖。那里，象其他修正主义国家一样，监牢里关满了人。革命的同志只是因为他们反抗赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的背叛就被关进监牢和被杀害。但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者永远也摧毁不了马克思列宁主义者的反抗。
    他说，在苏联和其它修正主义集团掌权的国家中，人们看到道德上、政治上和经济上的严重的蜕化变质。苏联已经形成了同铁托统治下的南斯拉夫相似的局面，各种各样的经济组织和管理机构，已经根据资本主义方式建立起来。
    霍查同志揭露了继承赫鲁晓夫的苏联修正主义领导力图召开一个所谓“国际共产主义运动的联合会议”的阴谋和狼狈处境。他指出，这是一个反对中国和阿尔巴尼亚，反对马克思列宁主义的会议。但是，在这个问题上，甚至在各国修正主义头目之间，也没有一致的意见，这不是因为他们喜欢我们，而是因为他们不愿意被纳入由苏修行使霸权的轨道。
    霍查同志指出，苏修叛徒集团和他们的同伙所执行的反社会主义的政策，在他们自己国家的人民中引起了极大的不满。这是正在发展中的辩证的过程。这种不满渐渐地、不断地积聚起来，增长起来，最后总有一天要爆发的。霍查同志强调必须加强反对修正主义叛徒们的斗争，从而确保尽早地促使修正主义叛徒们完蛋。他说，我们的重大职责是：援助那些遭受修正主义压迫之害的各国兄弟人民，为不断地巩固我们党、我们的国家、我国的经济而不倦地工作。使我们党、我们的国家、我国的经济随时作好准备，并保持高度的警惕性，使我们党、我们的国家、我国的经济更加强大，更加千锤百炼，使我们的敌人更加望之而生畏。
    霍查同志还揭露了铁托叛徒集团竭力利用在南斯拉夫发生的地震来削弱南斯拉夫境内的阿尔巴尼亚族居民的抵抗。霍查同志说，在阿尔巴尼亚境内，我们在二十天内重建了五千多间被地震摧毁和受损坏的住房；而在边界的那一边，在南斯拉夫，人们不仅在已经开始的严冬中挨冻，而且还要在以后的岁月中继续吃苦头。塞尔维亚和门的内哥罗等地的沙文主义铁托分子，对于医治地震所造成的创伤，什么事情也没有做，只是竭力利用地震造成的灾祸来削弱阿尔巴尼亚族居民的抵抗。因此，他们拚命把德巴尔地区的居民迁移到南斯拉夫各地去，以便使这些阿尔巴尼亚族人居住的地区丧失民族特性。但是他们是永远不能得逞的，因为阿尔巴尼亚族人几百年来世世代代保持着他们的纯粹的民族感情、他们的语言、他们的战斗传统和他们对祖国的无限热爱。现在他们仍然坚强地保持着这种感情。因此，铁托分子为反对他们所做的一切都是徒劳的。霍查同志指出，铁托当局还想尽办法盗窃外国寄给南斯拉夫地震灾民的援助，它们根本不打算救济地震灾民。阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界都注视着它们损害灾民的滔天罪行。
