In the unprecedented great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories nationwide, the capital's urban and rural markets are rich in goods, prices are stable, trade is brisk, and a revolutionary prosperous scene is presented. The revolutionary masses of the financial and commercial front in the capital and the broad revolutionary staff members have enthusiastically responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, "Grasp the revolution and promote production," actively doing a good job in the procurement and supply of goods, effectively ensuring the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and ensuring the needs of industrial and agricultural production and the lives of urban and rural people.

With the continuous development of industrial production in the capital and the bumper harvest in the suburbs, from January to November this year, the procurement volume of major agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, fat pigs, fresh eggs, and aquatic products in Beijing has increased significantly compared to the same period last year. The sales volume of industrial products such as cotton cloth, clothing, cloth shoes, knitted products, enamel products, aluminum products, and sewing machines, which are needed for the daily life of the broad masses of the people, has increased to varying degrees. The sales volume of paper, pens, ink, ink, and ink needed for the Cultural Revolution and the revolution to resume classes has increased significantly. The revolutionary staff members of the commercial front have sent various daily industrial products that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants love to the countryside. This year, the sales volume of towels, socks, underwear, bicycles, and sewing machines purchased by suburban farmers has increased by one-quarter to more than one-fold compared to the same period last year. Pork, poultry, eggs, fruits, vegetables, candies, tea leaves, and other sideline food products have been supplied in full. Although it is now midwinter, in various vegetable markets in the capital, there are still many varieties and abundant quantities of meat, chicken, duck, and vegetables.

"Navigating the great sea depends on the helmsman, and revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought." The thriving situation in the urban and rural markets of the capital is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since the Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary staff members on the financial and commercial front in the capital have followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, vigorously implemented the general policy of financial and economic work proposed by Chairman Mao, "Develop the economy and ensure supply," and the strategic policy of "Prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." They have fought side by side with the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the capital and the Red Guards, and launched a fierce attack on the feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism poison spread by China's Khrushchev and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the commercial and service industries, making the spiritual outlook and enterprise image of the broad staff members in the commercial and service industries in the capital completely new. In the large and small shops, restaurants, inns, and photo studios scattered throughout the urban and rural areas of the capital, Chairman Mao's portraits, quotations from Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao's poems are hung everywhere. Today's shops in the capital have become important positions for spreading Mao Zedong Thought.

The financial and commercial workers of Beijing, who live by the side of Chairman Mao, regard ensuring the supply of urban and rural markets in the capital as a glorious political task given to them by Chairman Mao. They have bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production in the Cultural Revolution.

Since the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on inspecting North China, Central South, and East China, the broad revolutionary staff members on the financial and commercial front have immediately launched a learning campaign. They take "Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles" as the basic textbooks, universally opening Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 70% of revolutionary staff members and revolutionary cadres participating in the study. In the study classes, they adhere to the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, combine the struggle of their own departments and units with their own active thoughts, break down selfishness, establish public-mindedness, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and make the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination in the financial and commercial system of Beijing develop greatly.

    在抓革命促生产的大好形势下
    首都市场商品丰富购销活跃
    据新华社三十日讯  在全国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的空前大好形势下，首都城乡市场商品丰富，物价稳定，购销活跃，呈现一片革命的繁荣景象。首都财贸战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，积极作好商品收购、供应工作，有力地保证了无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展，保证了工农业生产和城乡人民生活的需要。
    随着首都工业生产的不断发展和郊区农业大丰收，今年一至十一月份，北京市的粮食、棉花、肥猪、鲜蛋、水产等主要农副产品的收购量，都比去年同期有显著增加。广大人民群众日常生活需要的棉布、服装、布鞋、针织品，搪瓷制品、铝制品、缝纫机等工业品的销售量，都有不同程度的增长。文化大革命和复课闹革命所需要的纸张、笔、油墨、墨汁、墨水等的销售量，有大幅度的增长。商业战线的革命职工，把广大贫下中农喜爱的各种日用工业品源源调运农村，今年以来郊区农民购买的毛巾、袜子、卫生衫裤，自行车、缝纫机等商品，比去年同期增长四分之一到一倍以上。猪肉、家禽、蛋品、果品、蔬菜、糖果、茶叶等副食品一直满足供应。目前虽然时至隆冬，在首都各菜市场里，肉类、鸡、鸭和蔬菜，仍然品种很多，数量充裕。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。首都城乡市场欣欣向荣的大好形势，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。文化大革命开展以来，首都财贸战线上的广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大力贯彻毛主席提出的“发展经济，保障供给”的财经工作总方针和“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针。他们和首都工农兵群众及红卫兵小将并肩战斗，猛烈地涤荡了中国赫鲁晓夫和彭真反革命修正主义集团在商业、服务业里散布的封建主义、资本主义和修正主义流毒，使首都商业、服务业广大职工的精神面貌和企业的面貌焕然一新。遍布首都城乡的大小商店、饭店、旅店、照像馆里，到处都挂着伟大领袖毛主席像、毛主席语录和毛主席诗词。今天的首都商店，已经变成传播毛泽东思想的重要阵地。
    生活在毛主席身边的北京市财贸职工，把保证首都城乡市场供应当作毛主席交给自己的一项光荣政治任务。他们在文化大革命中勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担。
    毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区的一系列最新指示发表以来，财贸战线上的广大革命职工，立即掀起了学习热潮，他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席最新指示和“老五篇”为基本教材，普遍开办了毛泽东思想学习班，已有百分之七十以上的革命职工和革命干部参加学习。在学习班里，他们坚持毛主席所倡导的马克思列宁主义革命好学风，联系本部门、本单位的斗争实际和自己的活思想，大破私字，大立公字，克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，使北京市财贸系统的革命大联合和革命三结合有了很大发展。
