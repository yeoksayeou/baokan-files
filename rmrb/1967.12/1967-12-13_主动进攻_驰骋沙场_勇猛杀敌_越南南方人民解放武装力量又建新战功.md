The brave and skilled People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam have been galloping across various battlefields since December, bravely fighting the enemy and achieving many new victories.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces in Binh Dinh Province, following their complete annihilation of a U.S. Army battalion and five puppet army companies in the Bu Dop area at the end of November, have tightly besieged this base. According to Western news agencies, the U.S. imperialists, in order to rescue their besieged invading troops, hastily dispatched B-52 bombers to bomb the positions of the People's Liberation Armed Forces. The brave People's Liberation Armed Forces, relying on solid fortifications and trenches, have firmly held their positions. In the eight-day siege up to December 6, they seized opportunities to launch fierce attacks with mortars, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

In the Mekong Delta, the People's Liberation Armed Forces fought a fierce battle on December 9, about eleven kilometers north of Di An, annihilating nearly 200 enemy troops from three puppet army battalions. Earlier, on December 5, the People's Liberation Armed Forces cleverly cut off the Fourth Highway to Saigon in four places, completely paralyzing the enemy's transportation and logistics.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces in Quang Tri Province, adjacent to the demilitarized zone, launched a fierce attack on December 6 against a U.S. Marine Corps base north of Kon Tum. After a short battle, they killed and wounded nearly 100 American aggressors. On December 7, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in Thua Thien Province used mortars to fiercely bombard a U.S. Marine Corps camp nine kilometers from Hue, also inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Currently, the American aggressors in Quang Tri and Thua Thien Provinces are in a state of panic under the continuous and heavy blows from the People's Liberation Armed Forces.

According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the northern part of Quang Tri Province, adjacent to the demilitarized zone, launched continuous attacks on the enemy in the Ninth Highway area over nine days up to December 4, annihilating more than 600 U.S. and puppet troops, shooting down and destroying many enemy aircraft and armored vehicles, and blowing up four bridges.

The report said that on November 30, the People's Liberation Armed Forces engaged in hand-to-hand combat with U.S. Marine Corps troops in Yu Ling County, annihilating more than 300 enemy troops and foiling their "sweeping" operations. On November 26, the People's Liberation Armed Forces intercepted U.S. Marine Corps troops coming out from the Kon Tum base for "sweeping," annihilating more than 100 enemy troops and capturing many weapons and ammunition.

On December 4, local forces and guerrillas in Yu Ling County annihilated more than 100 U.S. and puppet troops in the Trung Gian River area, capturing many weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

According to another report, the guerrillas in Phong Dien County, Thua Thien Province, blew up six U.S. military trucks with landmines near the An Lo base on December 4, killing 60 U.S. troops. Thus, since May 28, the guerrillas in Phong Dien County have conducted three battles using landmines, destroying 28 enemy vehicles and annihilating nearly 300 U.S. troops.
