Many Norwegian and Danish friends have written letters or made statements, warmly praising Chairman Mao as the greatest leader of the revolutionary people, and hailing Mao Zedong Thought as an invincible ideological weapon for winning revolutionary victories.

A Norwegian friend said, "The history of modern China has proven that Chairman Mao is the great leader of the people." Another friend wrote in a letter, "Chairman Mao is 'our true Chairman, our dear comrade and comrade-in-arms.'" The letter was written in Chinese, English, and Norwegian: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! 'Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!' The Norwegian friends also enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought. They said: Mao Zedong Thought has made China a fortress for revolutionary struggle, and it has great significance not only for China but for the world revolution. "Mao Zedong Thought can bring victory to the revolutionary people," "With Mao Zedong Thought, one has an invincible ideological weapon." They called the "Little Red Book" a "powerful weapon, a spiritual hydrogen bomb." They said, "Reading this book, one can find the truth."

Many Norwegian friends highly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They pointed out that the Cultural Revolution enables China to prevent the restoration of capitalism and the emergence of revisionism as in the Soviet Union. They pointed out that China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, has set a brilliant example of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism for the world. "China is an eternal beacon, illuminating the path for those who hope to build a world without imperialism."

Three Danish friends who recently visited China spoke highly of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They said, "The situation in China is excellent." "The Cultural Revolution has consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat." They said, "The Cultural Revolution is indeed a great revolution." "The attitude towards the Cultural Revolution is a political stance. If you like the dictatorship of the proletariat, you will like the Cultural Revolution."
