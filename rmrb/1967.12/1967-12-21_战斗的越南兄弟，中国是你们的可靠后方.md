When we heard from the radio the most red, most red sun in our hearts, the most revered great leader Chairman Mao, representing the Chinese people, sending a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, we, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune, were all exhilarated and in high spirits. Chairman Mao's congratulatory telegram spoke the words in our hearts, fully and most concentratedly expressing the iron will and firm determination of the 700 million Chinese people to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in defeating the American aggressors. We raised our arms and shouted, "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Vietnam will win! The U.S. will be defeated!" We shouted loudly, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

For seven years, the people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have raised the great banner of anti-American and national salvation, waging a heroic struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys, achieving brilliant victories, and setting a shining example of anti-American armed revolutionary struggle for all peoples of the world.

American imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and all revolutionary peoples of the world. Under extremely difficult conditions, the Vietnamese people, relying on their own strength, have fought the most ferocious American imperialism to the point of desperation, making it look ridiculous and utterly defeated. This once again proves that American imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. American imperialism uses various means of military adventurism and political deception, which can only further expose its weakness and cannot save it from its doomed fate. The Soviet revisionist leadership actively helps American imperialism peddle the "peace talks" hoax, playing the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick of fake support and real betrayal, and it cannot save American imperialism from its complete failure. It can only show the world that the Soviet revisionist leadership and American imperialism are birds of a feather.

The great victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression has disrupted the counter-revolutionary global strategic deployment of American imperialism and powerfully supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries in the world.

The great victory of the Vietnamese people fully proves the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

Heroic Vietnamese brothers and sisters, we will definitely follow the great teachings of Chairman Mao, pledge to be your strong rear, and make our vast land a reliable rear for you. We, all the poor and lower-middle peasants, will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, vigorously conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, work hard on the words, and ignite a revolution deep in the soul, turning the vast countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school. We will definitely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev pushed in the countryside. We will focus on the revolution and vigorously promote production, supporting you with practical actions.

    战斗的越南兄弟，中国是你们的可靠后方
    中越友好人民公社全体贫农下中农
    从广播里传来我们心中最红最红的红太阳、最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席代表中国人民给阮友寿主席的贺电时，我们中越友好人民公社的全体贫农下中农人人振奋，一片欢腾。毛主席的贺电，说出了我们贫农下中农的心里话，最充分、最集中地表达了我们七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民打败美国侵略者的钢铁意志和坚强决心。我们振臂高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“越南必胜！美帝必败！”我们放声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    七年来，越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，高举抗美救国的伟大旗帜，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行英勇奋战，取得辉煌的胜利，为全世界人民树立了反美武装革命斗争的光辉榜样。
    美帝国主义是越南人民、中国人民、全世界革命人民的不共戴天的死敌。越南人民在非常艰苦的条件下，依靠自己的力量，把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，一败涂地。这再一次雄辩地证明了美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎。美帝国主义采用军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，只能更加暴露它的虚弱本质，决不能挽救它灭亡的命运。苏修领导集团积极帮助美帝国主义推销“和谈”骗局，玩弄假支持、真出卖的反革命两面手法，也挽救不了美帝国主义彻底失败的命运。它只能向全世界人民表明，苏修领导集团和美帝国主义完全是一丘之貉。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，打乱了美帝国主义的反革命全球战略部署，有力地支持了全世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    越南人民的伟大胜利，充分证明了毛主席指出的真理：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    英雄的越南兄弟姐妹们，我们一定遵循毛主席的伟大教导，誓作你们的坚强后盾，把我们辽阔的国土作为你们的可靠后方。我们全体贫农下中农坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，在灵魂深处爆发革命，把广大农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。我们一定狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行的反革命修正主义路线。狠抓革命，猛促生产，用实际行动支援你们。
