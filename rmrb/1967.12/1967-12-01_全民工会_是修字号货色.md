Chairman Mao teaches us: "Trade unions are mass organizations of the working class. We should absorb all hired laborers, including progressive, intermediate, and backward elements, with only a few reactionary elements excluded." At the same time, Chairman Mao specifically points out: "We must beware of pickpockets and prevent reactionary spy elements from infiltrating the trade unions." However, China's Khrushchev is audacious and openly defies Chairman Mao's instructions. He blathers on about: "As long as one is a salaried laborer, regardless of beliefs, one can join the trade union. If one is a university professor, even if his family owns several hundred acres of land, he can join the trade union." He even advocates that members of democratic parties can hold leadership positions in the trade unions. During the Four Clean-ups Movement, he further opened the doors of the trade unions, shouting that "landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and those who have returned from the countryside can join the trade unions after reform," deliberately blurring class lines. Everyone knows that the Four Clean-ups Movement is a life-and-death struggle between two classes and two lines; it is a great struggle to eliminate capitalism and promote socialism; it is a struggle to prevent revisionism and fight against it. It is a century-long plan for the proletariat to uproot the roots of revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism. Yet, in this great struggle, China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, in order to protect the bourgeoisie, engage in the despicable act of surrendering to the bourgeoisie.

For a long time, the trade union of our Shanghai Watch Factory has implemented the revisionist line of China's Khrushchev. Before the Four Clean-ups Movement, it absorbed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements into the trade union. During the Four Clean-ups Movement, following China's Khrushchev's black instructions, it covered up landlords, capitalists, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who had hidden their class backgrounds, did not label them, and retained their membership. For example, in one workshop, a landlord element was exposed, but the leadership not only did not label him as a landlord but also rated him as a model worker and called on workers to learn from him, which is utterly despicable. In another workshop, the head of an anti-party clique had his party membership revoked, but his trade union membership was retained. Isn't this turning the trade union into a hodgepodge? In the later stages of the Four Clean-ups Movement, under the slogan of "small business owners returning to the ranks" proposed by the big traitor China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, dozens of small business owners were pulled into the trade union under the guise of "independent laborers returning to the ranks," attempting to turn the trade union into an "all-people's trade union" that does not distinguish between classes or enemies. Their intentions are truly malicious.

China's Khrushchev, this big traitor, vigorously advocates the theory of "extinction of class struggle" and actively promotes the "all-people's trade union," attempting to blur class lines and make organizational preparations for the restoration of capitalism, which is truly a heinous crime. "The golden monkey wields a thousand-catty cudgel, and the jade sky is cleared of a myriad of dust." We must wield the thousand-catty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, pursue the enemy, and smash the "all-people's trade union," "production trade union," and "welfare trade union" to smithereens!

    “全民工会”是修字号货色
    工总司上海手表厂造反兵团
    毛主席教导我们：“工会是工人阶级的群众组织，我们要吸收一切雇佣劳动者包括进步的，中间的，落后的都加入工会，只有极少数的反动分子才除外。”同时，毛主席又特别指出：“要谨防扒手，防止反动特务分子混入工会。”可是中国的赫鲁晓夫却胆大包天，公然对抗毛主席的指示。胡说什么：“只要是工薪劳动者，不分信仰，都可加入工会。如果是大学教授，即令其家里有几百亩地，可以加入工会。”甚至主张民主党派成员也可以担任工会领导工作。在四清运动中，他更进一步敞开工会大门，叫嚷“地富反坏和还乡团，改造好的可以加入工会”，竭力混淆阶级阵线。大家知道，四清运动是两个阶级、两条道路的生死大搏斗；是灭资兴无、防修反修的伟大斗争；是无产阶级为了挖掉修正主义根子，避免资本主义复辟的百年大计。可是在这场伟大的斗争中，中国赫鲁晓夫以及他在上海的代理人，为了保护资产阶级，就大搞投降资产阶级的卑鄙勾当。
    我们上海手表厂工会，长期以来也执行了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义的工运路线。在四清运动前，吸收了地富反坏分子加入工会。在四清运动中，按照中国赫鲁晓夫的黑指示，将四清中挖出来的隐瞒成份的地主、资本家、特务、反革命分子等包庇过关，不戴帽子，保留会籍。例如，有个车间揪出了一个地主分子，领导上不仅不给他戴上地主帽子，还评他为五好工人，号召工人向他学习，真是混蛋透顶。另一个车间有个反党集团的头目，党籍虽开除了，但还保留会籍。这不是把工会办成大杂烩是什么？四清运动后期，就在大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人提出的所谓“小业主归队”口号下，以“独立劳动者”“归队”之名，将几十名小业主拉进工会，企图把工会演变成不分阶级，不分敌我的“全民工会”。其用心何其毒也。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个大工贼，竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，积极推行“全民工会”，妄图混淆阶级阵线，为资本主义复辟作好组织准备，真是罪大恶极。“金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，乘胜追击，把“全民工会”，“生产工会”，“福利工会”砸个稀巴烂！
