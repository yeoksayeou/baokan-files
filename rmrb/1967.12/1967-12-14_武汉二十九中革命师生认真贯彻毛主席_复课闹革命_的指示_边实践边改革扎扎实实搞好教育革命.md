Revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan No. 29 Middle School are seriously implementing Chairman Mao's directive to "resume classes and make revolution." They are practicing and reforming, steadily carrying out the educational revolution.

In their practice of teaching reform, they have established three viewpoints in their minds: revolutionary viewpoint, viewpoint of people's war, and viewpoint of linking with reality. In their actions, they insist on three combinations: combination of teachers and students, combination of teaching practice and teaching reform, and combination of classroom activities and extracurricular activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 10th: Revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan No. 29 Middle School, in the process of resuming classes and making revolution, have clearly established three viewpoints in their minds and insisted on three combinations in their actions. Therefore, the educational revolution in this school is both vigorous and solid.

The three viewpoints they have established in their minds are: revolutionary viewpoint, viewpoint of people's war, and viewpoint of linking with reality. The three combinations they insist on in their actions are: combination of teachers and students, combination of teaching practice and teaching reform, and combination of classroom activities and extracurricular activities.

In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, revolutionary teachers and students of this school deeply realized that to accomplish the great and magnificent task of educational revolution, they must take Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline, take "criticize self and criticize revisionism" as the key, and establish a thorough revolutionary viewpoint. They have realized from practice that without destruction, there can be no construction. To establish an unprecedented proletarian educational system, they must start from revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev. Without criticizing and exposing the revisionist educational line, educational revolution is just an empty talk. They believe that the proletarian educational system can only be created by those who master Mao Zedong Thought. To carry out educational revolution with any selfish motives is definitely not going to work. Therefore, while reforming the old educational system, teaching content, and teaching methods, revolutionary teachers and students must also reform the "self" in their minds. Revolutionary teachers and students of this school have also realized from practice that to accomplish the great and magnificent task of educational revolution, they must mobilize all revolutionary teachers and staff, organize the broadest revolutionary forces, mobilize all positive factors, and fight a "people's war." At the same time, they must combine the daring spirit of revolution with the scientific spirit of practical work, firmly establish the viewpoint of linking with reality in teaching reform, that is, linking with the actual teaching of this school and this subject, linking with the actual thoughts of revolutionary teachers and students, and linking with social reality.

Revolutionary teachers and students of this school have also realized from the practice of resuming classes and making revolution that to carry out teaching reform well, they must insist on three combinations in their specific actions:

First, combination of teachers and students. Close combination of teachers and students is an important link to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of teachers and students. Revolutionary teachers of this school used Mao Zedong Thought to fight against selfishness, removed worries such as fear of hard work, resolutely abolished the teaching and research groups that isolated teachers and students, and with the spirit of being willing to be a primary school student, went down to the classes, studying, working, criticizing self and revisionism, and researching problems together with the students. Students correctly treated teachers, actively invited teachers to participate in various activities, sought teachers' opinions, and enthusiastically helped and supported teachers in teaching reform. Teachers regarded the opinions students raised about their teaching as the greatest political help and support from students. Due to the establishment of a new type of teacher-student relationship, each class gradually established a new revolutionary order, and the enthusiasm of teachers and students for resuming classes and making revolution became higher and higher.

Second, combination of teaching practice and teaching reform. In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, revolutionary teachers and students of this school seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "No matter who wants to understand something, except to come into contact with that thing, that is, to live in (practice in) the environment of that thing, there is no way to solve it.... You want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality." They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, actively participated in the great practice of educational revolution, teaching and reforming at the same time, and made a good start. For example, in teaching methods, teachers and students prepared lessons together before class, and used the inductive teaching method during class to improve students' thinking ability and initiative. Some courses were even taught by students, with teachers only playing a guiding role. In teaching content, language, foreign language, and political courses took the study of Chairman Mao's works and class struggle as the main content. The teaching content of mathematics, physics, and chemistry also initially deleted some parts that were not in line with actual needs.

Third, combination of classroom activities and extracurricular activities. After resuming classes and making revolution, this school, while seriously carrying out classroom activities and teaching and reforming at the same time, also carried out various extracurricular activities. For example, they held various thematic debates, exchanges, discussions, and criticism meetings, organized part of the teachers and students to conduct social investigations in nearby factories, organized teachers to visit students' families, invited soldiers to give reports, and held revolutionary parents' meetings, etc. These activities were all carried out around the educational revolution. These various extracurricular activities fully mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of revolutionary teachers and students, and the whole school formed a lively and lively political situation. Revolutionary teachers and students were both tense and happy, and the past atmosphere of "teaching dead books" and "dead reading books" has fundamentally changed.

　　武汉二十九中革命师生认真贯彻毛主席“复课闹革命”的指示
　　边实践边改革扎扎实实搞好教育革命
    他们在教学改革的实践中，从思想上树立了三个观点：革命的观点，人民战争的观点，联系实际的观点；在做法上坚持三个结合：教师和学生相结合，教学实践和教学改革相结合，课堂活动和课外活动相结合
    新华社武汉十日电　武汉市第二十九中学的革命师生，在复课闹革命的过程中，从思想上明确地树立了三个观点，在做法上坚持了三个结合，因此这个学校的教育革命搞得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。
    他们从思想上树立的三个观点是：革命的观点；人民战争的观点；联系实际的观点。他们在做法上所坚持的三个结合是：教师和学生相结合；教学实践和教学改革相结合；课堂活动和课外活动相结合。
    这个学校的革命师生在复课闹革命的过程中深刻地认识到，要完成教育革命这个伟大豪迈的事业，必须以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲，树立彻底革命的观点。他们从实践中体会到，不破不立，要建立起史无前例的无产阶级的教育制度，必须从革命的大批判入手，彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义教育路线。不把修正主义教育路线批透批臭，教育革命就是一句空话。他们认为，无产阶级教育制度只能由掌握毛泽东思想的人来创建。带着任何私心杂念去搞教育革命，是肯定搞不好的。因此，在革旧的教育制度、教学内容和教学方法的命的同时，革命师生也必须革自己头脑里“私”字的命。这个学校的革命师生从实践中还体会到，要完成教育革命这个伟大豪迈的事业，一定要进行全体革命师生员工的总动员，组织起最广泛的革命队伍，调动起一切积极因素，打好一场“人民战争”。同时，还必须把敢想敢干的革命精神同脚踏实地的科学精神结合起来，在教学改革中牢固地树立起联系实际的观点，即联系本校和本科目教学的实际，联系革命师生的思想实际，联系社会实际的观点。
    这个学校的革命师生还从复课闹革命的实践中体会到，要搞好教学改革，还要在具体做法上坚持三个结合：
    第一，教师和学生相结合。师生紧密结合，是充分调动师生积极因素的重要环节。这个学校的革命教师用毛泽东思想狠斗私字，解除了怕工作难做等顾虑，坚决取消了隔绝师生联系的教研组，以甘当小学生的精神，全部下到班级里去，和学生一起学习，一起劳动，一起斗私批修，一起研究问题。学生正确对待教师，主动邀请教师参加各种活动，征求教师意见，热情帮助和支持教师改革教学。教师把学生对自己教学上提出的意见，看作是学生对自己在政治上的最大帮助和支持。由于建立了新型的师生关系，各班也逐渐建立起革命的新秩序，师生复课闹革命的积极性越来越高。
    第二，教学实践和教学改革相结合。在复课闹革命的过程中，这个学校的革命师生认真学习了毛主席的教导：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于
  （实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。……你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”他们遵照毛主席的教导，积极投入教育革命的伟大实践中去，边教学，边改革，而且做出了良好的开端。譬如，在教学方法上，课前师生共同备课，上课采用启发式的教学方法，提高学生的思考能力和主动精神；有的课程还由学生讲解，教师只起辅导作用。在教学内容方面，语文、外语和政治课，以讲毛主席著作和阶级斗争为主要内容。数理化方面的教学内容，也初步删减了一些不合实际需要的部分。
    第三，课堂活动和课外活动相结合。这个学校复课闹革命以后，在认真搞好课堂活动，进行边教学边改革的同时，还开展了多种多样的课外活动。譬如，他们召开了各种专题辩论会、串连会、座谈会、批判会，有计划地组织部分师生到附近的工厂做社会调查，组织教师访问学生家庭，邀请解放军同志来校作报告，召开革命家长座谈会，等等。这些活动都是围绕着搞好教育革命进行的。这些多种多样的课外活动，使革命师生的革命积极性得到了充分的发挥，全校形成了一种生动活泼的政治局面。革命师生们紧张而愉快，过去那种“教死书”“死读书”的空气有了根本的改变。（附图片）
