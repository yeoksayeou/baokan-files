The military and civilians of the Fourth Military Region on the frontline of North Vietnam have shot down 1,000 U.S. aggressor aircraft. The *People's Daily* and the *People's Army Daily* of Vietnam both published editorials on the 22nd, enthusiastically celebrating this glorious achievement.

The editorial in the *People's Daily* stated that the U.S. aggressors have concentrated most of their air power to launch extremely savage and brutal attacks on the Fourth Military Region, attempting to prevent the northern compatriots from fulfilling their duty to their southern brethren. However, all their plots and schemes have been foiled.

The editorial expressed confidence that the military and civilians of the Fourth Military Region will surely repel all enemy air raids, promote production and combat, ensure transportation, and make contributions to the complete victory of the entire military and civilian population over the U.S. aggressors.

The editorial in the *People's Army Daily* warmly praised the glorious achievements of the military and civilians of the Fourth Military Region in withstanding the enemy's frenzied bombing and shelling over the past three years. The editorial called on all military and civilians in the north to learn from the military and civilians of the Fourth Military Region, heighten vigilance, fight bravely, and strive to achieve even more glorious victories.
