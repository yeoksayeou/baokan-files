The old education system is a crime-ridden monstrosity. The traitor, China's Khrushchev, along with the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and others, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's directives on educational revolution. They stubbornly clung to the old educational system, retaining the educational structure of the old China and extensively plagiarizing the so-called "experiences" of the Soviet revisionists, turning our education system into a hybrid of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism.

The old education system has the following major crimes:

1. **Expanding the Three Great Differences**

   China's Khrushchev divided our schools into two types: one to cultivate intellectual laborers, who upon graduation become cadres, engineers, artists, theorists, educators, etc.; the other to cultivate manual laborers, who upon graduation become workers, peasants, and service personnel, etc.

   The Fourth Middle School was one of the ten key full-time schools selected by the old Beijing Municipal Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi and his henchmen said, "The Fourth Middle School must provide semi-finished products for experts," and "its main task is to cultivate talent for key universities." They used bourgeois ideology to corrupt the youth. Some people believed that once they got into the Fourth Middle School, they would naturally go to university and had no intention of becoming workers or peasants.

   The old education system cultivates a portion of "rulers" who are intellectual laborers and a portion of "ruled" who are manual laborers. Students who attend full-time schools, especially key schools, do not want to go to the countryside to be farmers after graduation. The result is the expansion of the differences between intellectual and manual labor, urban and rural areas, and workers and peasants, which runs counter to communism.

2. **Detaching from the Three Great Revolutionary Movements**

   The old education system spans from primary school to university, totaling sixteen or seventeen years. In this long period, students do not see how workers work, how peasants farm, or how businesspeople conduct trade. They are detached from the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment.

   Class struggle is a major course for students. However, China's Khrushchev wants students to "hear nothing outside the window, mind only the holy books." The school regulations stipulate that teachers and students engage in political activities for no more than two hours per week in junior high school and no more than three hours per week in senior high school. After studying for so many years, students become politically blind, ignorant of class, revolution, and proletarian dictatorship.

   Students spend so much time detached from productive labor, and every day they only see textbooks and concepts, nothing else. Junior high school graduates go to communes and cannot write notices, write large characters, or use an abacus; they only know how to write about "the azure sky and the green fields." Senior high school students go to factories and are not useful; they have a full set of theories but cannot do practical work, and they know nothing about agriculture. The knowledge learned in universities is often not applicable.

3. **Imposing Bourgeois Dictatorship on Workers and Peasants**

   Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must plan, work, and think based on the fact that our country has six hundred million people. We must never forget this." However, China's Khrushchev cunningly proposed whether the quality of schools has declined since liberation, thereby drastically cutting down on people-run schools and speed-up middle schools for workers and peasants. He openly declared, "Speed-up middle schools for workers and peasants can stop recruiting students." At the same time, he imposed dictatorship on revolutionary students, workers, peasants, and their children in the full-time school system.

   The old education system has a long duration, generally sixteen to seventeen years, and even longer for graduate students. The vast majority of workers and peasants and their children, due to production needs and economic constraints, simply cannot afford to study for such a long time, and many are forced to drop out. This situation is even more prevalent in rural areas.

4. **Encouraging Youth to Pursue Personal Fame and Profit**

   The length of the old education system determines the job position and social status of graduates. For example, university graduates naturally become technicians, engineers, cadres, etc., while middle and primary school graduates can only do manual labor or farming.

   The old education system has become a "career ladder" for some students to seek fame and profit.

   Why do some people go to great lengths to get their children into the Fourth Middle School or other "key" middle schools? It is to let their children go to university. In their eyes, a certain university is the cradle of engineers, and the Fourth Middle School is its "affiliated school," which is a "shortcut" to climb up.

5. **Destroying the Physical Health of Youth**

   The physical health of youth is also greatly damaged. For example, in this "key" school, the Fourth Middle School, a senior high school graduating class of forty-seven students has twenty-three with nearsightedness, fourteen who cannot participate in major political activities due to chronic diseases, and thirty-six with various illnesses. This class had four students drop out due to illness during the three years of senior high school.

   The old education system advocated by China's Khrushchev is riddled with crimes. Its evil purpose is to maintain their bourgeois dictatorship in the educational front, cultivate bourgeois successors, and serve their restoration of capitalism in China.

　　旧学制的五大罪状
　　北京市第四中学红卫兵团
    中国赫鲁晓夫伙同反革命修正主义分子彭真、陆定一等，疯狂地反对毛主席关于教育革命的指示，顽固地维护旧的教育制度。他们保留旧中国的学制，又大量抄袭苏修的所谓“经验”，使我国的学制成为封、资、修的混合物。
    旧学制主要有如下罪状：
    一、扩大三大差别
    中国赫鲁晓夫把我国学校分为两个类型：一是培养脑力劳动者，毕业后当干部、工程师、文学艺术家、理论家、教育家等等；一是培养体力劳动者，毕业后当工人、农民、服务人员等等。
    四中是旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团选中的北京十个重点全日制学校之一。反革命修正主义分子陆定一及其爪牙们说：“四中必须为专家提供半成品”，“主要任务是为重点大学培养人材”。他们用资产阶级思想腐蚀青年。有些人就认为考上了四中当然上大学，根本没有当工人农民的打算。
    旧学制培养的，一部分是“治人”的脑力劳动者，一部分是“治于人”的体力劳动者。上了全日制学校、特别是重点学校的学生，毕业后不愿意下乡当农民。其结果是扩大了体力劳动同脑力劳动的差别、城乡差别和工农差别，同共产主义背道而驰。
    二、脱离三大革命运动
    旧学制从小学到大学共十六七年。这么长的时间，学生看不见工人怎样做工、农民怎样种田、商业人员怎样做买卖，脱离阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动。
    阶级斗争是学生的一门主课。而中国赫鲁晓夫却要学生“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”。学校规定师生每周政治活动，初中不得超过两小时，高中不得超过三小时。这样读了十几年书，学生不就成为不懂阶级、不懂革命、不懂无产阶级专政的两眼昏黑的政治庸人了吗？
    学生在这样长的时间里脱离生产劳动，每天接触的除了课本还是课本，除了概念还是概念，别的什么也不知道。初中毕业生下到公社，不会写通告，不会写大字，不会打算盘，光会写什么“蔚蓝的天空，碧绿的田野”。高三学生下到工厂，不好派用场，理论一整套，活计插不上手，农业更是一窍不通。大学里学习的一套，也往往是所学非所用。
    三、对工农实行资产阶级专政
    毛主席教导我们：“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发，千万不要忘记这一点。”而中国赫鲁晓夫却阴险地提出解放后学校“是否比解放前质量降低了”，从而大砍为工农所办的民办学校、工农速成中学。他公然叫嚣：“工农速成中学可以停止招生。”与此同时，他又在全日制学校系统对革命学生、工农及其子女实行专政。
    旧学制的期限很长，一般十六年到十七年，研究生毕业时间就更长。广大工农群众及其子女由于生产需要和经济条件的限制，根本不可能读这么长时间的书，不少人被迫半途退学。这种情况在农村更为普遍。
    四、鼓励青年追求个人名利
    旧学制学习期限的长短，决定了毕业生的工作职务和社会地位。例如，大学毕业生的当然职务就是技术员、工程师、干部等等，而中、小学毕业生则绝大部分只能做工务农。
    旧学制成为一些学生索取名利的“升官图”。
    为什么社会上总是有人千方百计让其子女考入四中或其他“重点”中学呢？就是为了让他们的子女上大学。在他们眼里，某大学是工程师的摇篮，四中则是这个大学的“附中”，这是一条向上爬的“捷径”。
　　五、摧残青年的身体健康
    青年的身体也受到很大的摧残。例如在四中这个“重点”学校，一个高三毕业班四十七人，有二十三人近视眼，有十四人因慢性病不能参加大的政治活动，还有三十六人患有各种疾病。这个班在高中三年内，有四人因病休学。
    中国赫鲁晓夫主张的旧学制罪恶累累。其罪恶的目的就是为了维护他们在教育阵地上的资产阶级专政，培养资产阶级接班人，为他们在中国复辟资本主义服务。
