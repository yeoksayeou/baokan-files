Yemenis Bravely Counter U.S. Imperialism's Plot to Overthrow the Republic

The arch-enemy of the Arab people, U.S. imperialism, recently plotted to overthrow the Yemen Arab Republic. It openly instigated the reactionary forces of Saudi Arabia to support the royalist forces in Yemen, along with foreign mercenaries, to invade the Yemeni capital of Sana'a. Their aim was to capture Sana'a, overthrow the republican government, and then threaten the newly independent People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. This was part of their evil plan to control the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula and the Red Sea, and to suppress the national liberation movements there. However, the U.S. imperialists' plot was thwarted by the strong resistance of the Yemeni government and people.

On December 12th, Hassan Amri, the acting chairman of the Yemen Republican Council and the commander-in-chief of the Yemeni armed forces, held a press conference in Sana'a. He denounced the U.S. imperialists' plot and displayed photographs of American weapons seized by the Yemeni side during this subversive activity. He said that the Yemeni authorities had evidence of U.S. support for the royalist forces.

Amri stated that the imperialist forces had sent mercenaries to Yemen to sow discord and unrest among the people. However, in the face of the Yemeni people's resolute support for the republican government, these mercenaries had fled.

Reports indicated that at the end of November and the beginning of December, a portion of the Yemeni forces supporting the royalists, at the instigation and support of U.S. imperialism, along with foreign mercenaries, launched attacks on Sana'a from several directions. The military and civilians of Sana'a immediately rose up to defend the capital and established people's resistance organizations in Yemen, launching a struggle against the U.S. imperialists' plot to overthrow the Yemeni republican government. The U.S. imperialists' plot was quickly thwarted by the Yemeni people's resistance. On December 7th, the Yemeni government announced that the republican army had inflicted heavy casualties on a group of mercenaries who had invaded eastern Yemen with the royalist forces and had seized a large amount of weapons and equipment. On December 9th, Sana'a Radio announced, "The Yemeni armed forces attacked the lairs of the infiltrators."

In this struggle against the U.S. imperialists' plot to overthrow Yemen, the Soviet revisionist leadership once again exposed itself as a false friend of the Arab people. When the Yemeni capital was under attack, the Soviet embassy personnel and "experts" in Yemen hurriedly fled Sana'a. A Yemeni official, when asked by a reporter why the Soviets had fled, said it was because they were afraid of the bombardment. Another Yemeni official, when discussing the withdrawal of the Soviet embassy personnel from Sana'a, said: "The Soviet leaders have degenerated and are intoxicated with the idea of peaceful coexistence with imperialism."

In this anti-subversion struggle, the Yemeni people increasingly recognized that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, are the true friends of the Arab people. A Yemeni official told the Chinese embassy personnel: "The Chinese people, guided by Chairman Mao's teachings, are our most reliable friends. You are fearless in the face of danger, and this has given us immense confidence and strength. Now we see clearly who our true enemies are and who our true friends are."

Another Yemeni friend said: "Only the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao truly understand us and support us." A Yemeni youth, upon seeing the Chinese embassy personnel, shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Chinese people!"

　　也门人民奋勇反击美帝颠覆共和国阴谋
    美帝支持也门王室势力伙同外国雇佣军窜犯首都萨那受挫
    据新华社十六日讯　萨那消息：最近，阿拉伯人民的头号死敌美帝国主义对阿拉伯也门共和国策划了一次颠覆阴谋。它公然唆使沙特阿拉伯反动势力，支持也门王室势力，伙同外国雇佣军窜犯也门首都萨那，企图以攻陷萨那、颠覆共和政权作为第一步，进而威胁刚独立的南也门人民共和国，实现其控制阿拉伯半岛南部和红海门户、镇压那里的民族解放运动的罪恶计划。但是，美帝国主义的颠覆阴谋，遭到了也门政府和人民的有力反击。
    也门共和国委员会代理主席、也门武装部队总司令哈桑·阿姆里十二日在萨那举行的记者招待会上，谴责了美帝国主义的阴谋活动。他展示了在这次颠覆阴谋活动中被也门方面缴获的美国武器的照片。他说，也门当局掌握了谴责美国支持王室势力的证据。
    阿姆里说，帝国主义势力派了雇佣军在也门人民中间制造不和和骚乱。但是在也门人民坚决拥护共和政权的情况下，这些雇佣军已经逃跑了。
    据报道，在十一月底和十二月上旬，也门一部分支持王室的势力，在美帝国主义的唆使和支持下，同外国雇佣军一起分几路进犯萨那。萨那军民立即奋起参加保卫首都的战斗，并在也门建立了人民抵抗组织，展开一场抗击美帝颠覆也门共和政权的斗争。美帝国主义的阴谋在也门人民的反击下很快遭到挫败。也门政府在七日宣布，共和国军队使一群在也门东部同王室势力一起进犯的雇佣军遭受了重大的伤亡，并缴获了大量的武器和其他装备。九日，萨那电台宣布，“也门武装部队袭击了渗入者的窠穴”。
    在这次也门人民抗击美帝国主义颠覆阴谋的斗争中，苏修领导集团又一次暴露出它是阿拉伯人民的假朋友。在也门首都遭到进犯的时候，苏修在也门的使馆人员及“专家”都匆忙从萨那逃走。也门一位负责官员在回答一名记者问到为什么苏联人逃跑时说，这是因为他们害怕炮弹的袭击。另一位也门官员在谈到苏修使馆人员撤离萨那一事时说：“苏联的领导人蜕化变质了，醉心于同帝国主义讲和平共处。”
    也门人民在这场反颠覆斗争中越来越认识到在伟大领袖毛主席领导下的中国人民是阿拉伯人民的真正的朋友。一位也门官员对中国大使馆人员说：“毛主席教导的中国人民，是我们最可靠的朋友，你们临危不惧，给我们增加了无比信心和力量。现在我们看清了谁是我们真正的敌人，谁是我们真正的朋友。”
    另一位也门朋友说：“只有毛主席领导的中国人民最了解我们，最支持我们。”一位也门青年见到中国大使馆人员时，高呼“毛主席万岁！”“中国人民万岁！”
