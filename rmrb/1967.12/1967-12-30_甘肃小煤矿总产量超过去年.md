More than 20 prefectures and counties in Gansu Province that manage small coal mines have completed their annual raw coal production plan ahead of schedule by more than one month, and the total raw coal production has exceeded that of last year.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," various coal mines have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize selfishness and establish public spirit. The revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres have undergone a complete change in their spiritual outlook, greatly promoting coal production.

    甘肃小煤矿总产量超过去年
    甘肃省二十多个专区、县管理的小煤矿提前一个多月超额完成了全年的原煤生产计划。原煤总产量超过了去年。
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，各煤矿纷纷举办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛泽东思想为武器，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。革命职工和革命干部的精神面貌焕然一新，大大促进了煤炭生产。
