The counter-revolutionary revisionist element, Lu Dingyi, in order to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev, aims to turn the educational sector into an outpost for the restoration of capitalism. He repeatedly advocates the theory of "education for all." He rambles on about how Confucius's "education for all" is "correct," is "people-oriented," and that today's socialist education is still "education for all," and so on. This is all nonsense!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." In a class society, education has class characteristics and always follows a certain class line. In other words, where there is "education," there must be "class."

Let us first examine what kind of thing Confucius, the feudal landlord class representative, was promoting with his "education for all"!

Confucius's students were mostly from the landlord class and the aristocratic bureaucracy. The children of the working people were kept out. Even his supposedly impoverished disciple Yan Hui, who is said to have lived in a humble alley with "one basket of food and one gourd of drink," actually came from a family of officials and landlords with "five mu of fields outside the city walls, enough for gruel; and forty mu of fields inside the city walls, enough for cotton and hemp." Clearly, Yan Hui was also from an official landlord family.

Confucius's educational goal was entirely to cultivate obedient slaves for the feudal ruling class. According to the "Records of the Grand Historian," Confucius's students at that time "scattered among the princes, the greater ones becoming teachers and ministers, the lesser ones becoming friends and teachers of officials."

Confucius's education was entirely for the service of the feudal ruling class. His so-called "education for all" was purely a deception of the working people. Lu Dingyi's shameless praise of Confucius's educational thoughts fully exposes his ugly face as a spokesperson for the exploiting class.

For a long time, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi and his henchmen have been using the banner of "education for all" to stubbornly push a bourgeois class line in the educational sector, implementing a shocking bourgeois dictatorship.

They actively promote the bourgeois examination system for admissions. Without asking about class origins or political conditions, they implement a system where bourgeois politics and scores are paramount, opening wide the doors for those so-called "academically excellent" members of the exploiting class, while excluding a large number of excellent workers and peasants' children from the school gates.

At the same time, Lu Dingyi and his henchmen ruthlessly suppress and persecute worker and peasant students, maliciously cursing worker and peasant students as "culturally backward, stupid, old, and without prospects for cultivation," as "coarse earthenware cups that cannot be carved with flowers." They madly shout: "What class line? If you can't study, you'll be expelled!" They even go to great lengths, using surprise attack methods in exams, setting difficult and biased questions, driving out a large number of worker and peasant students from the school gates.

Lu Dingyi and his ilk also vigorously promote bourgeois ideas such as "academics first," "pyramid-style elimination," and "genius education." They use every means to exclude workers and peasants' children, widen the gap between physical labor and mental labor, lead students down the path of pursuing personal fame and fortune, and attempt to cultivate them into "spiritual aristocrats" who stand above the laboring people.

And so on, the list goes on.

Is this "education for all"? No, absolutely not! This is a bloody picture of capitalist restoration hidden under the cover of "education for all"!

The educational front is an important battlefield in the ideological realm, and education is a tool of class struggle. The proletariat must use education to cultivate and produce successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and the bourgeoisie also wants to use education to cultivate their own successors. Lu Dingyi's frantic promotion of the "education for all" theory is precisely to meet the political needs of the bourgeoisie, to cultivate their own successors, and to serve the restoration of capitalism in China.

The "education for all" theory that Lu Dingyi has been vigorously promoting is actually a rehash of the revisionist "universal education." It is based on the theory of the extinction of class struggle. Lu Dingyi has repeatedly declared, "Now the classes have been eliminated," "class struggle... has basically ended." This theory of the extinction of class struggle comes from China's Khrushchev.

Chairman Mao clearly pointed out as early as 1934: "Here all cultural and educational institutions are in the hands of the working people. Workers and peasants and their children have the priority to enjoy education. The Soviet government uses all methods to raise the cultural level of workers and peasants." Our great leader Chairman Mao has set a proletarian class line for our educational cause. At the same time, this is also a fatal criticism of Lu Dingyi's "education for all" theory.

    戳穿“有教无类”的骗局
    山红
    反革命修正主义分子陆定一，为了推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，把教育界变成复辟资本主义的前哨阵地，一再鼓吹“有教无类”论。他胡说什么，孔子讲“有教无类”是“对”的，是“有人民性的”，今天的社会主义教育也“还是‘有教无类’”，等等。这完全是一派胡言！
    毛主席教导我们：“一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”在有阶级的社会里，教育是有阶级性的，总是贯彻一定的阶级路线的。也就是说，有“教”必有“类”。
    让我们首先来看一看，封建地主阶级的孔子所宣扬的“有教无类”，究竟是什么货色吧！
    孔子招收的学生，绝大部分是地主阶级和贵族官僚的子弟。劳动人民的子弟，是被拒之门外的。就连他那个相传“一箪食、一瓢饮、在陋巷”的大弟子颜回，实际上也是“世世仕鲁为卿士”，“有郭外之田五十亩，足以给饘粥；有郭内之田四十亩，足以为棉麻”。可见颜回也是官僚地主的子弟。
    孔子的教育目的，也完全是为了给封建统治阶级培养驯服的奴才。据《史记》载，孔子的学生当时“散游诸侯，大者为师傅卿相，小者友教士大夫”。
    孔子的教育完全是为封建统治阶级服务的。他的所谓“有教无类”，纯粹是对劳动人民的欺骗。陆定一对于孔子教育思想的无耻吹捧，完全暴露了他的剥削阶级代言人的丑恶嘴脸。
    长期以来，反革命修正主义分子陆定一及其爪牙们，就是打着“有教无类”的幌子，在教育界顽固地推行一条资产阶级的阶级路线，实行骇人听闻的资产阶级专政。
    他们积极推行资产阶级招生考试制度。不问阶级出身，不看政治条件，实行资产阶级政治挂帅、分数挂帅，为那些所谓“学习成绩好”的剥削阶级予女大开方便之门，而把大量优秀的工农子女排斥于校门之外。
    与此同时，陆定一及其爪牙们还残酷地打击、迫害工农学生，恶毒地咒骂工农学生“文化低，脑子笨，年龄大，无培养前途”，是“粗瓷茶碗不能硬雕花”。他们疯狂地叫嚣：“什么阶级路线，学不好，就退学！”他们甚至挖空心思，采用突然袭击的考试办法，出难题，出偏题，把大量工农学生赶出校门。
    陆定一之流还竭力鼓吹什么“智育第一”、“小宝塔式的淘汰制”和“天才教育”等等资产阶级的货色。他们千方百计地排斥工农子女，扩大体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别，把学生引上追逐个人名利的邪路，妄图把他们培养成高踞于劳动人民之上的“精神贵族”。
    如此等等，不一而足。
    难道这是“有教无类”吗？不是，绝对不是！这是用“有教无类”的遮羞布掩盖着的一副血淋淋的资本主义复辟的画图！
    教育战线是意识形态领域中一个重要的战场，教育是阶级斗争的工具。无产阶级要通过教育来培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人，资产阶级也要通过教育来培养资产阶级接班人。陆定一拚命鼓吹“有教无类”论，正是为了适应资产阶级的政治需要，为他们培养自己的接班人，在中国复辟资本主义服务的。
    陆定一所大肆宣扬的“有教无类”论，实际上还是修正主义的“全民教育”的翻版。它是以阶级斗争熄灭论为基础的。陆定一就曾一再扬言，“现在阶级消灭了”，“阶级斗争……基本上结束了”。这个阶级斗争熄灭论就是从中国赫鲁晓夫那里来的。
    毛主席早在一九三四年就明确指出：“这里一切文化教育机关，是操在工农劳苦群众的手里，工农及其子女有享受教育的优先权。苏维埃政府用一切方法来提高工农的文化水平。”我们伟大的领袖毛主席为我们的教育事业规定了一条无产阶级的阶级路线。同时，这也是对陆定一的“有教无类”论的致命批判。
