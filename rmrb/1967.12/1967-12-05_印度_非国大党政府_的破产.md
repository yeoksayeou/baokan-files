In the increasingly sharp class struggle in India, the so-called "non-Congress government" that the Indian revisionists of the Communist Party have been hyping up has long been politically bankrupt. Recently, the Indian reactionary ruling clique, feeling that the "non-Congress government" in West Bengal was useless, simply ordered its dissolution and sent a large number of troops into Calcutta to carry out more direct and brutal suppression of the people's resistance struggle in this state. Thus, the whole fraud of the so-called "non-Congress government" has been exposed.

The so-called "non-Congress government" was originally a trick played by the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, using the Indian revisionists of the Communist Party and the Danji traitor clique, as well as various reactionary politicians, to deceive the Indian people. The crisis of the Congress Party government, which represents the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, is becoming increasingly serious. The broad masses of the people are rising up in a stormy struggle against hunger and tyranny. The entire country is in a state of panic. It was precisely under these circumstances that the Indian ruling clique, through the "Fourth General Election" in India this February, put up the signboard of the "non-Congress government" in Kerala, West Bengal, and several other states, in order to meet the needs of maintaining reactionary rule.

The likes of Nambudiripad, the Indian revisionists of the Communist Party, obtained a few official positions from the Indian reactionary government and eagerly promoted the "non-Congress government" in Kerala and West Bengal as "people's governments" and "models of peaceful transition," singing praises to the sky. However, just as they were singing the song of "peasant transition," the storm of revolutionary armed struggle arose in the Indian countryside. Under the strong impact of the armed struggle of the Nasalbari peasants, this group of traitors and labor bosses wearing the "non-Congress government" hats immediately showed their true colors.

The actions of the so-called "non-Congress government" over the past half year have fully exposed its reactionary nature.

Whether in Kerala or in West Bengal, the "non-Congress government" ruthlessly suppressed the people's revolutionary struggles. They have sent police out dozens of times to suppress workers' resistance against capitalists and peasants' resistance against landlords seizing land. In the jungles of West Bengal and the streets of Kerala, this group of traitors and labor bosses have incurred debt after debt of blood from the Indian working and peasant masses.

Whether in Kerala or in West Bengal, the "non-Congress government" has striven to maintain the interests of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, not touching a single hair of the feudal landlords and comprador bourgeoisie. The likes of Nambudiripad promised to protect the interests of the Birla group in Kerala and were willing to create favorable conditions for Indian monopoly capital to further exploit the working people. In the countryside, these two state governments openly whitewashed the Congress Party's fake land reform, maintaining the deep-rooted feudal rule of the landlord class, while the broad masses of peasants continue to suffer heavy oppression and exploitation.

Whether in Kerala or in West Bengal, the "non-Congress government" implemented a pro-American, flattering-American, treacherous policy. They begged and pleaded with American imperialism for "aid," hoping to rely on American grain to solve the food shortage, and opened the door wide for the penetration of imperialist monopoly capital. They even publicly defended the American "Peace Corps" for engaging in espionage activities and opposed driving the "Peace Corps" away.

Iron facts have proven that the so-called "non-Congress government" headed by the Indian revisionists of the Communist Party is completely a slave of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, a butcher of revolutionary people, and a running dog of imperialism. At the same time, it has also proven that the so-called "theory" of "peaceful transition" advocated by the Indian revisionists of the Communist Party is completely a counter-revolutionary fraud.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

The likes of Nambudiripad openly swore: "As long as parliamentary democracy and the electoral system continue to exist in the country (India), communists will not take up arms." They vigorously advocated: "As long as the Kerala-style 'non-Congress democratic coalition government' is 'expanded' to other states and the entire Indian basis, it can 'peacefully transition' to 'socialism'." This is a barefaced betrayal of Marxism-Leninism.

The entire state machine of India is in the hands of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and each state government is only a part of this state machine. Nambudiripad himself also admitted that the "non-Congress government" can only "implement the same policies formulated by the Indian (central) government." Under the dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, without seizing political power and smashing the old state machine, but attempting to realize "peaceful transition" through the organization of one state government after another "non-Congress government," is it not completely a daydream!

Lenin once said: "As long as the old, bourgeois, bureaucratic state apparatus remains intact, ... in any 'coalition' cabinet with 'socialists,' ... these socialists are actually decorations and screens of the bourgeois government, lightning rods for this government to avoid the wrath of the people, and tools for this government to deceive the masses." Is not the so-called "non-Congress government" that the likes of Nambudiripad boasted about, a tool of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie?

The Indian revisionists of the Communist Party shamelessly sang praises to India's so-called "parliamentary democracy and electoral system," hoping to use this "democracy" to achieve socialism, which is particularly absurd. In such a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country as India, there is originally no "democracy" to speak of. The Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, in order to cover up their brutal rule, played a few tricks of parliament and elections, which are completely for the service of the reactionary politics of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Facts have proven that when the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie need it, they can give you a few seats in the parliament, and they can also let you set up a "non-Congress government" to serve as their tool; but when they think they no longer need it, they can easily kick you out. The takeover of the Kerala state government in 1959 and the dissolution of the "non-Congress government" in West Bengal this time are living examples.

The fallacies of "peaceful transition" advocated by the Indian revisionists of the Communist Party and the so-called "non-Congress government" they organized play a role in numbing the revolutionary will of the people, preventing the people from rising up in revolution, and destroying the people's revolutionary struggle, completely serving the Indian reactionary ruling clique. The counter-revolutionary revisionist line they implement is no different from that of the Danji traitor clique. The Indian revisionists of the Communist Party, represented by Nambudiripad, pretended to oppose the Danji traitor clique, but in fact, they are just a pair of twins.

Today, the armed peasant revolution under the banner of Nasalbari, the peasants' land seizure struggle, is breaking out in many places. The armed struggles of the Naga and Mizo peoples are continuing and developing. After kicking out the Danji traitor clique, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India and the broad revolutionary people are engaged in a sharp, irreconcilable struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the likes of Nambudiripad. Through a tortuous struggle process, they are finding the correct path to revolutionary victory. This path is the one pointed out by Chairman Mao: under the leadership of the proletarian party, mobilize the peasant masses in the countryside to wage guerrilla warfare, carry out land revolution, establish rural base areas, surround the cities with the countryside, and finally seize the cities.

We are firmly convinced that the five hundred million people of India, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, under the leadership of a revolutionary party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, after a long struggle, will overcome all difficulties, overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism and its running dogs in India, and achieve the final victory of the revolutionary struggle.

    印度“非国大党政府”的破产
    观察家
    在印度日益尖锐的阶级斗争的激流中，印共修正主义分子大吹大擂的所谓“非国大党政府”，早就在政治上破产了。最近，印度反动统治集团由于感到西孟加拉“非国大党政府”不中用，干脆下令解散了这个邦政府，并且把大量军队开进加尔各答，对这个邦的人民反抗斗争进行更直接更残暴的镇压。这样，所谓“非国大党政府”的大骗局，就全部被拆穿了。
    所谓“非国大党政府”，本来是印度大地主大资产阶级利用印共修正主义分子和丹吉叛徒集团以及形形色色的反动政客，搞的一个愚弄印度人民的把戏。代表大地主大资产阶级利益的国大党政府的统治危机，日益严重。广大人民反饥饿反暴政的斗争风起云涌。整个印度处于惶惶不可终日的局面。正是在这种情况下，印度统治集团通过今年二月印度“第四届大选”，在喀拉拉、西孟加拉和其他几个邦，把“非国大党政府”的招牌抬了出来，以适应维护反动统治的需要。
    南布迪里巴德之流的印共修正主义分子，在印度反动政府那里讨得个一官半职，就拚命宣扬喀拉拉邦和西孟加拉邦的“非国大党政府”，是什么“人民政府”啦，“和平过渡的典范”啦，吹得天花乱坠。可是，正当他们高唱“和平过渡”迷魂曲的时候，革命武装斗争的风暴在印度农村中兴起。在纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争的强烈冲击下，这一伙戴着“非国大党政府”乌纱帽的叛徒和工贼，马上就现了原形。
    所谓“非国大党政府”上台半年多来的所作所为，已经充分暴露了它的反动本质。
    无论在喀拉拉还是在西孟加拉，“非国大党政府”都穷凶极恶地镇压人民的革命斗争。它们曾数十次地出动警察，镇压工人反抗资本家的斗争和农民反抗地主夺佃的斗争。在西孟加拉的丛林和喀拉拉的街头，这伙叛徒和工贼欠下了印度工农群众一笔又一笔血债。
    无论在喀拉拉还是在西孟加拉，“非国大党政府”都竭力维护印度大地主大资产阶级的利益，没有触动封建地主和官僚买办资产阶级的一根毫毛。南布迪里巴德之流满口答应保护比拉财团在喀拉拉邦的利益，而且愿意为印度垄断资本进一步榨取劳动人民制造有利条件。在农村，这两个邦政府公开为国大党的假土地改革涂脂抹粉，维护地主阶级根深蒂固的封建统治，而广大农民则继续遭受深重压迫和剥削。
    无论在喀拉拉还是在西孟加拉，“非国大党政府”都实行亲美媚美的卖国政策。它们向美帝国主义摇尾乞怜，求讨美帝国主义的“援助”，指望依靠美国粮食来解决粮荒，并且为帝国主义垄断资本的渗透大开方便之门。它们甚至公开替进行间谍活动的美国“和平队”辩护，反对把“和平队”赶走。
    铁的事实证明，印共修正主义分子主持的所谓“非国大党政府”，完全是大地主大资产阶级的奴仆，是屠杀革命人民的刽子手，是帝国主义的走狗。同时也证明，印共修正主义分子鼓吹的所谓“和平过渡”的“理论”，完全是骗人的反革命货色。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    南布迪里巴德之流公然赌咒发誓说：“只要在本国（印度）还继续存在议会民主和选举制，共产党人就不会拿起武器。”他们极力鼓吹：只要把喀拉拉邦式的“非国大党的民主联合政府”，“扩展到其他的邦和全印基础上”，就可以“和平过渡”到“社会主义”。这是对马克思列宁主义的赤裸裸的背叛。
    印度的整个国家机器，掌握在大地主大资产阶级手里，它的每个邦政府不过是这个国家机器的组成部分。南布迪里巴德自己也承认，“非国大党政府”只能“执行印度（中央）政府所制定的同样的政策”。在大地主大资产阶级专政之下，不夺取政权，不打碎旧的国家机器，而企图通过组织一个邦又一个邦的“非国大党政府”的途径，来实现“和平过渡”，岂非完全的梦呓！
    列宁曾经说过：“只要旧的、资产阶级的、官僚的国家机构原封不动地保留下来”，“无论在哪一种有‘社会主义者’参加的‘联合’内阁里，……这些社会主义者实际上都是资产阶级政府的装饰品和屏风，是这个政府躲避人民愤怒的避雷针，是这个政府欺骗群众的工具”。南布迪里巴德之流吹嘘的所谓“非国大党政府”，不正是印度大地主大资产阶级的御用工具吗？
    印共修正主义分子无耻地讴歌印度的所谓“议会民主和选举制”，指望利用这种“民主”来搞社会主义，这尤其荒唐透顶。在印度这样半殖民地半封建国家，本来就没有什么“民主”可言。印度大地主大资产阶级为了掩饰他们的残暴统治，搞那么一点议会和选举之类的把戏，也完全是为大地主大资产阶级的反动政治服务的。事实证明，当印度的大地主大资产阶级需要时，他们可以在议会里给你几个席位，也可以让你搞个把“非国大党政府”来充当他们的工具；而当他们认为已经不再需要的时候，就可以轻而易举地把你一脚踢开。一九五九年喀拉拉邦政府的被接管和这一次西孟加拉邦“非国大党政府”的被解散，就是活生生的例证。
    印共修正主义分子鼓吹的这一套“和平过渡”的谬论和他们组织的所谓“非国大党政府”，起着麻痹人民革命意志，阻止人民起来革命，破坏人民革命斗争的作用，完全是为印度反动统治集团效劳的。他们所执行的反革命修正主义路线，同丹吉叛徒集团并没有什么区别。以南布迪里巴德为代表的印共修正主义分子，装作反对丹吉叛徒集团，其实他们不过是一对孪生兄弟。
    今天，以纳萨尔巴里为旗帜的印度的农民武装革命，农民的夺地斗争，正在许多地方爆发出来。那加族和米佐族的武装斗争正在坚持和发展。印共革命派和广大革命人民继踢开丹吉叛徒集团之后，正在同南布迪里巴德之流的反革命修正主义路线进行着尖锐的、不调和的斗争。他们经过曲折斗争的过程，正在找到取得革命胜利的正确道路。这条道路，就是毛主席所指出的，在无产阶级政党的领导下，在农村中发动农民群众进行游击战争，开展土地革命，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的道路。
    我们坚信，印度五亿人民，必将在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，在一个以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的革命党的领导下，经过长期的斗争，战胜一切困难，推翻帝国主义及其走狗在印度的反动统治，取得革命斗争的最后胜利。
