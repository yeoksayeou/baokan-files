In collusion with U.S. imperialism's new plot, betraying the interests of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people

The Soviet revisionist leadership announced on December 3 that, in order to "develop friendly and cooperative relations" with the U.S. imperialist lackey Mobutu clique in Congo (Kinshasa), it has decided to "restore diplomatic relations" with the Mobutu puppet regime, which has the blood of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people on its hands. This is another shameful act of betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership in collusion with U.S. imperialism against the African people, particularly the Congolese (Kinshasa) people.

Since 1964, the Congolese (Kinshasa) people have been bravely and persistently waging armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and all its lackeys, achieving new victories. In this situation, the new lackey Mobutu, who took power in November 1965 under the direction of his U.S. imperialist master, has been pretending to change some of the practices of the previous puppet regimes, donning various disguises, and attempting to infiltrate the ranks of the independent African nations to sabotage the cause of African unity against imperialism. The Soviet revisionists closely collaborate with this new plot of U.S. imperialism, eagerly praising Mobutu and whitewashing him. The Moscow magazine *New Times* this January, in tune with the U.S. imperialists, praised the Mobutu puppet regime for showing "new trends," claiming it "hopes to gain the support of the masses," and even absurdly claiming that the Mobutu regime has taken measures to "free itself from the economic control of foreign monopolies."

The collusion between the Soviet revisionist traitors and the Mobutu clique is not accidental. Since Congo (Leopoldville) declared independence in June 1960, the Soviet revisionist clique has been acting as a henchman of U.S. imperialism, committing heinous acts of betrayal against the Congolese (Kinshasa) people. They supported U.S. imperialism in using the United Nations as a cover to interfere in Congo, assassinate Lumumba, and strangle the legitimate Lumumba government. They advocated that the Congolese (Kinshasa) revolutionaries should "reconcile" with the puppet clique that takes orders from Washington, doing everything possible to sabotage the patriotic armed struggle of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people. Their hands are stained with the blood of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people.

The Congolese (Kinshasa) people have long seen through the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership acting as a henchman of U.S. imperialism. The Political Committee of the Western Front of the Congolese (Kinshasa) patriotic armed forces recently issued a statement on the third anniversary of the publication of the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao's "Statement in Support of the Congolese (Leopoldville) People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression," pointing out: "The U.S. imperialists are still systematically and desperately suppressing our national liberation movement, and the modern revisionist accomplices of U.S. imperialism are spreading defeatism and creating divisions in our ranks. 'The imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the leadership of the CPSU, along with all their lackeys, will be swept away by the people of all countries and thrown into the dustbin of history.'”

    配合美帝侵略新阴谋　出卖刚果（金）人民利益
    苏修宣布同蒙博托集团“恢复外交关系”
    新华社九日讯　苏修领导集团十二月三日宣布，“本着”同美帝国主义在刚果（金）的走狗蒙博托集团“发展友好和合作关系的愿望”，决定同双手沾满刚果（金）人民的鲜血的蒙博托傀儡集团“恢复外交关系”。这是苏修领导集团勾结美帝，对非洲人民，特别是刚果（金）人民的又一丑恶的叛卖行为。
    刚果（金）人民从一九六四年以来，一直英勇坚持武装斗争，反对美帝国主义以及由它扶植上台的所有走狗，并且不断取得新的胜利。在这种形势下，新走狗蒙博托于一九六五年十一月上台后，在其主子美帝国主义导演下，装模作样地改变了过去历届傀儡政权的一些做法，披上种种伪装，企图钻进非洲民族独立国家的队伍，来破坏非洲团结反帝事业。苏修紧紧配合美帝国主义的这个新阴谋，也竭力吹捧蒙博托，为他涂脂抹粉。莫斯科《新时代》周刊今年一月就按照美帝的调子，吹捧蒙博托傀儡集团“使人感觉到新的趋势”，它“希望得到群众的支持”，甚至还胡说什么蒙博托集团采取了“摆脱外国垄断资本的经济控制的措施”。
    苏修叛徒同蒙博托集团加紧勾结，绝不是偶然的。自从一九六○年六月刚果（利）宣布独立以来，苏修集团就一直充当美帝帮凶，干着出卖刚果（金）人民利益的罪恶勾当。他们支持美帝利用联合国旗帜干涉刚果，杀害卢蒙巴，扼杀卢蒙巴合法政府。他们鼓吹要刚果（金）革命者同听命于华盛顿的傀儡集团实行“和解”，千方百计破坏刚果（金）人民的爱国武装斗争。他们的双手沾满了杀害刚果（金）人民的血迹。
    刚果（金）人民早就看清了苏修领导集团充当美帝帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会最近就世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表三周年而发表的声明指出：“美帝国主义者今天仍在有计划地拚命地镇压我国的民族解放运动，美帝国主义的帮凶现代修正主义者则在我们的队伍中散布失败主义和制造分裂。”“以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者以及他们的一切走狗，都将被世界各国人民清除掉，并被扔进历史垃圾堆里去。”
