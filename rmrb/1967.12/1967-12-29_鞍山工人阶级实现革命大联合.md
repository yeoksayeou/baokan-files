In the unprecedentedly good situation of the nationwide Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the vast working class of Anshan, the largest iron and steel industrial base in the motherland, has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, and earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have achieved revolutionary great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

From December 25 to 26, Anshan held a conference of revolutionary workers' representatives from the entire city. The unified and revolutionary mass organization of the Anshan working class—the Workers' Congress—was born. This is a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Over the past year, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Anshan, with the Anshan Steel Works Defense Headquarters of Mao Zedong Thought as their representative, have, under the great encouragement and guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, waged a heroic struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan and Anshan Steel Works. With the most resolute and powerful support of the Anshan garrison and the 3174th Unit, they have finally achieved a decisive victory.

The broad revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, with the revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel Works as the main body, have followed the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, firmly grasped the revolutionary struggle's general direction, implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, deeply carried out the revolutionary criticism, and held Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The revolutionary workers have taken "Criticize and Repudiate Self and Oppose Revisionism" as the key link, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, linked theory with practice, and put what they learned into practice. They have overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, done more self-criticism, and correctly handled the relationships among various mass organizations. In early October, the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of various plants, mines, and offices of Anshan Steel Works quickly achieved revolutionary great unity in accordance with departments, workshops, and shifts under revolutionary principles. The advanced example of Anshan Steel Works revolutionary workers has powerfully promoted the revolutionary great unity wave surging forward in the entire city. The city quickly achieved revolutionary great unity in accordance with industries and systems. Now, 97% of the revolutionary mass organizations and 93% of the revolutionary workers in Anshan have achieved revolutionary great unity and participated in the Workers' Congress.

At the first meeting of the Anshan Workers' Congress, the responsible comrades of the Anshan garrison and the representatives of the proletarian revolutionary cadres spoke. They unanimously expressed their loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line forever. They will resolutely carry out the series of latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and vow to build Anshan into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

The meeting passed a telegram of respect to the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. The meeting also passed a letter to all revolutionary workers in the city.

    一年来，以鞍钢捍卫毛泽东思想战斗总部为代表的鞍山无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的巨大鼓舞和指引下，同中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山、鞍钢的代理人进行了英勇的斗争。在鞍山驻军和三一七四部队最坚决、最有力的支持下，终于取得了决定性的胜利。
    以鞍钢革命工人队伍为主体的广大无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，把毛主席的最新指示落实到行动上，深入开展革命大批判，大办毛泽东思想学习班。
