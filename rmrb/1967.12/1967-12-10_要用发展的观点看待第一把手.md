    To view the first-in-command from a developmental perspective
    Shanghai No. 3 Iron and Steel Plant Revolutionary Rebel Committee Dong Peiyuan

    We workers of the proletarian revolutionary faction in our plant, following Chairman Mao's directive, "Correctly handling cadres is a key problem in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the great alliance of revolution, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit. This problem must be solved," have selected the original plant manager and Party Committee member Chen Dashang to participate in the "three-in-one" leadership cadre.

    However, regarding whether Chen Dashang can serve as the first-in-command, there has been a heated debate within our revolutionary faction. Some comrades argue that Chen Dashang implemented the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. We criticized him and took away his power. Now, if we let him serve as the first-in-command, isn't this giving him back his power? Will the masses not say we are "fake rebels, true conservatives"?

    In response to these active thoughts, with the help of the army, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works.

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything should be done from the standpoint of the interests of the people as a whole, not from the standpoint of personal or partial interests." In light of Chairman Mao's teachings, we enlightened each other, recalling why we initially stood up to rebel and revolutionize, discussing for whom we seize power, for whom we hold power, and how to hold and use power well. Finally, we understood this principle.

    Chairman Mao often teaches us that we must view problems from the perspective of class and class analysis. When we analyze whether Chen Dashang can be the first-in-command, we cannot separate it from class analysis but should examine his entire history and work. We should see that in major issues, over the past decade, he has been loyal to Chairman Mao and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although Chen Dashang made mistakes in direction and line, after being tempered by the struggle of the masses, he has returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, gaining the understanding and trust of the masses. Therefore, letting Chen Dashang be the first-in-command is not "giving him back his power." His current line and guiding ideology are different. Letting him take the position of first-in-command and hold power with us is precisely to take responsibility for the revolution, to hold the power of the proletariat better, and to use it better.

    Through the debate on whether Chen Dashang can be the first-in-command, we realized that the proletarian revolutionary faction must continuously arm itself with Mao Zedong Thought, break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, in order to recognize the current good situation, keep up with the good situation, better understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's series of directives on the cadre issue, and more consciously carry them out.

    要用发展的观点看待第一把手
    上钢三厂工人革命造反委员会　董沛源
    我们厂无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好”的教导，推选原厂长、党委常委陈大同参加了“三结合”的领导班子。
    但是，对陈大同能否担任第一把手的问题，我们革命派内部有一场激烈争论。有些同志认为，陈大同在文化大革命初期执行过资产阶级反动路线，我们批判他，夺了他的权；而今又让他担任第一把手，这不是还权给他了吗？群众不会说我们是“假造反、真保皇”吗？
    针对这些活思想，在解放军的帮助下，我们反复学习了毛主席著作。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。对照毛主席的教导，我们互相启发，回忆自己当初为什么起来革命造反，讨论了为谁夺权、为谁掌权，怎样掌好权、用好权等问题，终于弄通了这个道理。
    毛主席经常教导我们，看问题必须从阶级和阶级分析的观点出发。我们分析陈大同能不能当第一把手的问题，也不能离开阶级分析，而应当考察他的全部历史和全部工作，应当看到在大节方面，十多年来他还是忠于毛主席、忠于毛主席的革命路线的。在无产阶级文化大革命一年多来，陈大同虽然犯了方向、路线的错误，但是经过群众斗争烈火的锻炼，他回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来了，取得了群众的谅解和信任。因此，让陈大同当第一把手，决不是“还权给他”。他现在执行的路线不同，指导思想不同，让他担任第一把手，和我们一起掌权，正是为了对革命负责，把无产阶级的权掌得更好，用得更好。
    通过对陈大同当第一把手的辩论，我们认识到，无产阶级革命派只有不断用毛泽东思想武装头脑，破私立公，才能认清当前的大好形势，跟上大好形势，才能更好地领会毛主席关于干部问题的一系列指示的伟大意义，更自觉地去贯彻执行。
