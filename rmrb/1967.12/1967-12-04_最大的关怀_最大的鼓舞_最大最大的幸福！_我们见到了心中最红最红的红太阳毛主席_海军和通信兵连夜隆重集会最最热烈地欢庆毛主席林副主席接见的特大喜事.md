We have seen in our hearts the reddest red sun, Chairman Mao.
The Navy and Communication Corps held a grand nighttime rally to enthusiastically celebrate the great joy of being received by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: Tonight, the representatives of the first Navy Conference on Learning from Chairman Mao's Works and the representatives of the Communication Corps' Directly Affiliated Units in Beijing, who were received by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, gathered with indescribable excitement and boundless happiness to celebrate this tremendous joy.

Late at night, the headquarters of the Navy and Communication Corps were brightly lit, with drums beating and firecrackers exploding. On top of the Communication Corps office building, the words "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and March Forward Bravely" shone in red light; the fireworks launched by the Navy units illuminated the night sky with vibrant colors. The representatives, who had just seen our reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, gathered on the square with tears of excitement, celebrating this unforgettable moment of happiness. They waved their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman" with great enthusiasm, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" They sincerely wished Chairman Mao eternal life and eternal health!

At the celebration held by the Navy, leaders such as Xiao Jinguang, Li Zuopeng, Wang Hongkun, Zhao Qimin, Zhou Xihan, and Zhang Xiuquan, along with all the representatives, joyously celebrated this great day. Li Zuopeng was the first to speak at the meeting. He said, "Today is the greatest day of joy for our Navy, the most glorious and happiest day. We have seen Chairman Mao, the great teacher, leader, commander, and helmsman of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, whom we long for day and night, and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, as well as other central leaders. This is the most exhilarating, most joyous, and most unforgettable great joy. This is the greatest concern, trust, encouragement, and motivation from Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin for all the representatives of the conference, for all the officers and soldiers of the Navy, and for all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. It is the highest honor given to us. The reception by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin will forever inspire us to march forward victoriously."

Li Zuopeng said, "Long-term revolutionary struggles have proven: above all else, following the great helmsman Chairman Mao is the most important; above all else, Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental reliance. Our Navy has been built, grown, and strengthened under the wise leadership and personal care of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, and nurtured by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Every achievement, every progress, and every victory in our struggles is the result of the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as our shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must launch a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, with the greatest determination, greatest willpower, and greatest effort, to truly master Mao Zedong Thought."

The active learners of Chairman Mao's works and battle heroes, Mei Xiande and Shu Jicheng, who were received by Chairman Mao and shook hands with him, as well as the active learner of Chairman Mao's works and political commissar of a certain unit, Zhang Yimin, were particularly excited tonight. Shu Jicheng, representing more than four thousand representatives, declared at the meeting that they would forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, even if their heads were cut off and their blood flowed, their spirits would not waver, and even if their bodies were crushed, their hearts would not change. They vowed to fight bravely on the battlefield of criticizing and repudiating revisionism, to spark a revolution deep in their souls, to let the great Mao Zedong Thought command every nerve and dye every cell red. They would definitely actively support the broad masses of the left, achieve new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and heighten their revolutionary vigilance, strengthen their preparedness, and resolutely, thoroughly, and completely annihilate all enemies who dare to invade.

The meeting passed a telegram of respect to the great helmsman Chairman Mao amid thunderous applause.

At the celebration held by the Communication Corps, leader Jiang Wen called on everyone to resolutely follow Vice Chairman Lin's teachings and launch a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. He said, "Learning Mao Zedong Thought must combine learning with application, see immediate results, and take decisive actions. This is how we show our boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao."

After the celebrations by the Navy and Communication Corps, all the representatives marched in a grand procession to the tune of "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman."
