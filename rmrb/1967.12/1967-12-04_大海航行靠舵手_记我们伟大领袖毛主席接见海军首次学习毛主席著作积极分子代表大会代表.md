At 10:15 PM on December 3, 1967, the most joyous and unforgettable moment arrived! The hearts of the representatives of the Navy Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works, gathered in the Great Hall of the People, surged like the waves of the sea.

A boundless red sun rose!

The representatives shouted in unison, waving their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting over and over again:

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

Our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao, radiant and spirited, waved his mighty hand repeatedly, stepped forward with vigorous strides, and came among the soldiers with his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and other central leaders.

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" The most sincere wishes, the loudest slogans, and cheers echoed like thunder, resounding across the heavens and reaching every corner of the land. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, the sailors will forever sing your praises. You are the helmsman of the great sea voyage, the beacon of human liberation, the brightest star in the sky, and the reddest sun in our hearts. We love and are loyal to you endlessly. The sky is our paper, the sea is our ink, and we cannot write enough; the mountains are our drums, the rivers are our zithers, and we cannot sing enough. On the tumultuous sea, we sing "The Great Sea Voyage Relies on the Helmsperson," and the more we sing, the stronger we become; in the misty journey, we sing "The Great Sea Voyage Relies on the Helmsperson," and the more we sing, the clearer our hearts become. Countless days and nights, countless dawns and dusk, we sing "The Great Sea Voyage Relies on the Helmsperson," navigating through reefs, passing through straits, riding the winds and breaking the waves, sailing from one victory to another; we sing "The Great Sea Voyage Relies on the Helmsperson" to welcome the dawn, to welcome the morning. Today, we sing "The Great Sea Voyage Relies on the Helmsperson" to welcome the ever-rising red sun in our hearts.

What a joyous moment! Chairman Mao, you received the sailors of the Navy, and you personally received the battle heroes Mei Xiande, Shu Jicheng, and Zhang Yimin, who have made numerous achievements, as well as the representatives of the "Red Revolutionary Alliance" of the Navy Headquarters. This is your greatest care, trust, encouragement, and exhortation for all the officers and soldiers of the Navy!

What a joyous moment! The sailors of the Navy shed tears of joy and carefully wrote down this most unforgettable moment in their lives on the cover page of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." A thousand words and ten thousand words cannot express the sailors' endless love for you, Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao, we sincerely wish you eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The sailors of the Navy love you the most

Every sunflower blooms towards the red sun, and every red heart is forever with Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The sailors of the Navy love you the most. The waves of the sea turn into songs of praise, but they cannot sing enough of our endless affection for you.

The heart of the battle hero Mei Xiande, who loves Chairman Mao the most, is the heart of millions of soldiers who love Chairman Mao. Mei Xiande thought of Chairman Mao in battle and found endless strength. After he was seriously wounded, the first expression on his face was seeing Chairman Mao's portrait; the first conscious movement of his limbs was touching Chairman Mao's portrait; the first smile was hearing "Long live Chairman Mao"; the first words he wrote were "Long live Chairman Mao"; the first three words he spoke were "Chairman Mao"; the first song he sang alone was "The East Is Red." Today, he finally realized his long-cherished wish to see Chairman Mao. When Chairman Mao shook his hand, he wished he could take out his red heart and offer it to Chairman Mao. He shouted passionately: "Long live Chairman Mao! Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

Chairman Mao, the soldiers who navigate deep in the ocean think of you every moment. They say: "Who says there is no sun in the deep sea? Chairman Mao is the reddest sun in our hearts, and Chairman Mao's radiant sunlight illuminates our submarine inside and out."

The fleet that patrols the vast seas of our motherland thinks of the red sun in their hearts day and night. The officers and soldiers say: "With the red sun, we are not afraid of strong winds and waves; with the red sun, we are not afraid of the vast misty sea; with the red sun, we will never lose our way."

The naval aviators who soar through the skies of our motherland think of Chairman Mao every moment. They say: "The plane hangs with Chairman Mao's portrait, and the cabin is brighter inside than outside. Through the clouds and mist, the direction is clear, and the enemy's courage is shattered in the long sky."

On the distant islands far from Beijing, the soldiers sing: "Thinking of Chairman Mao, my heart is warm; hanging Chairman Mao's portrait, the whole island is bright." They hang Chairman Mao's portrait on the highest peak of the island, letting the red sun shine brightly over the five continents and four seas.

The naval officers and soldiers who guard the coastal frontiers day and night have endless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, which cannot be sung in a thousand songs or spoken in ten thousand words. Every representative brought a thousand greetings, a thousand wishes, and a thousand resolute decisions to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death. Representative Liu Jitang of a certain unit, before coming to Beijing, found a note in his bag saying: "I am on duty, and you are going to Beijing. Please go to the portrait of Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square and shout 'Long live Chairman Mao' three times on behalf of my ancestors!" The back of the note also said: "Living on the island, my heart is with Beijing, following Chairman Mao, and revolution forever."

Wang Ruichang, the commander of a certain torpedo boat who was awarded a first-class merit in the "8.6" naval battle, had the honor of seeing our great leader Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate during the National Day celebration more than two months ago. Today, Wang Ruichang is once again fortunate to be by Chairman Mao's side. He said excitedly: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will forever follow the revolutionary course you have indicated and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end! We will plant the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is boundless and brilliant, all over the world!"

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, and you guide the revolutionary course for the people of the world. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the reddest sun in our hearts. The revolutionary ship of China, following the course you have opened, sails from victory to victory. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are our greatest commander. You personally created and led the unparalleled People's Liberation Army. After the national victory, you issued a great order to us: "To oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must definitely build a powerful navy." Today, we sailors see you, how can we not think of your meticulous care for us!

Chairman Mao, you personally created the People's Navy, personally formulated the guidelines, tasks, and scale of naval construction, and at every critical moment of naval construction, you gave timely and wise instructions. In 1950, in the first naval battle of the Wanshan Islands, our young navy, under the guidance of your brilliant thoughts, defeated the enemy's warships with wooden boats. You immediately praised us, giving us endless strength. In 1953, you personally inspected the navy, and on the warship, we spent four days and three nights with you, which is unforgettable. You encouraged us to love our warships, islands, and oceans. In 1958, you inspected a certain shipyard and fleet, personally boarded our domestically produced torpedo boats, and carefully asked the soldiers about the structure and power of the torpedoes. You also received naval personnel who had made outstanding contributions in battles many times. When you received Deputy Commander Wang Hongxi of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment," you highly praised the outstanding achievements of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment" for the people. You also carefully reviewed the battle summary of the "8.6" naval battle. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your meticulous care has warmed the hearts of every naval officer and soldier!

Ten thousand joys, a hundred thousand joys, growing up under your care is the greatest joy.

Feng Shangxian and Wang Jingnan, who had seen Chairman Mao on the warship years ago, saw Chairman Mao again today. They saw that he was as healthy as ever, and their hearts were filled with boundless joy. With tears of excitement, they recalled the scene of Chairman Mao visiting the soldiers on the warship fourteen years ago. They said: "Chairman Mao truly cares for us! As soon as Chairman Mao boarded the ship, he visited every soldier, from the bridge to the engine room, from the gun position to the kitchen. Every inch of the deck was left with his glorious footsteps. Chairman Mao asked about the soldiers' comfort and personally tasted the soldiers' food in the kitchen. When Chairman Mao took a group photo with the soldiers, he repeatedly asked if the people in the back could be photographed and if it was clear. To let every soldier enjoy the happiness of taking a photo with the great leader, Chairman Mao spent more than an hour, in three sessions, taking photos with all the soldiers." After seeing Chairman Mao today, Wang Shihu excitedly said: "Chairman Mao has inspected our warship for more than ten years. His glorious image is forever engraved in the hearts of every soldier; his affectionate instructions are always in our ears; his battle calls are our direction; his glorious thoughts forever nurture our growth. Over the past ten years, the crew on the ship has changed batch after batch, but the scene of Chairman Mao boarding the ship is passed down from generation to generation. We often lead the soldiers along the route Chairman Mao took when he boarded the ship, visiting the cabins and cabins where Chairman Mao stayed, and treating every place Chairman Mao has been to as a classroom for learning Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice."

Chairman Mao, under your affectionate care and cultivation, our navy has grown from nothing to something, from small to large, from weak to strong. All the officers and soldiers of the navy, under the illumination of your glorious thoughts, have overcome countless difficulties in revolutionary construction and battles, and together with the broad masses of the people, have built our great motherland's vast coastal defense into an impregnable iron wall.

In the famous "8.6" naval battle, the original commander of the "Pioneer Boat at Sea," Shi Tianming, who was awarded a first-class merit, did not blink his eyes when Chairman Mao received him, looking at Chairman Mao waving to everyone affectionately, looking at Chairman Mao's benevolent smile. He was moved to tears and shouted passionately: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" He recalled the scenes of the "Pioneer Boat at Sea" growing up under the nurturing of Chairman Mao's glorious thoughts in battles: When the "Pioneer Boat at Sea" fought the first battle in the Wanshan Islands, they knew nothing about "night navigation" or "naval combat regulations." However, they armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, had the courage to fear nothing, and used wooden-hulled boats, bayonets, and hand grenades to fight against the enemy's large warships. The soldiers, with their shining bayonets, boarded the enemy's so-called "sea tyrant" ship, frightening the enemy into surrendering. Over the past decade, the officers and soldiers of the "Pioneer Boat at Sea" have always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the "8.6" naval battle, which shocked the world, they read Chairman Mao's quotations while attacking: "To subdue all enemies and never be subdued by them," carrying forward the glorious tradition of close combat and night combat of our army. They braved the enemy's firepower and drove the torpedo boats right under the enemy's nose, sinking two enemy ships with their brother boats. After being received by Chairman Mao, Shi Tianming was extremely excited and said: "The growth of our pioneer boat cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a single moment or a single second."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! When we sailors are sailing to victory under your guidance, it is not always smooth sailing. Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing promoted the bourgeois military line, advocating "technology first" and "big competitions," stirring up wave after wave of storms, trying to lead our army construction astray. The broad officers and soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line fought against them head-on, thoroughly smashing their various plots. Brigade Commander Wu Yi, who saw our great commander Chairman Mao today, shouted over and over again: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" This brigade, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate, train, and command the troops. They resolutely resisted Luo Ruiqing's bourgeois military line, which opposed emphasizing politics, opposed the troops studying Chairman Mao's works, and opposed the four firsts. They were not afraid of pressure and were not deceived, always insisting on Chairman Mao's military line, breaking foreign dogmas, and establishing Mao Zedong Thought. They said: "Mao Zedong Thought is our soul. The most resolute execution of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is victory."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your glorious thoughts nurture our growth.

In the Great Hall of the People, the representatives were immersed in joyous celebration.

"The voice of 'Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!' and 'Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long, long live Mao Zedong Thought!' rose higher and higher. In this most joyous moment, how many soldiers had tears of joy in their eyes, recalling their growth!

"The great sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, wrote the most brilliant inscription for the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the navy, best expressing the wishes of the broad officers and soldiers of the navy.

We followed the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin and launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. Everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's glorious thoughts nurture our growth, Chairman Mao's great image inspires us to victory, and Chairman Mao's glorious works guide us to "devote our hearts to the people, guard the coastal defense, and fight the enemy."

The commander of the boat where Mei Xiande is stationed, Cui Fujun, saw Chairman Mao with boundless enthusiasm. A thousand words surged in his heart. He said, Mei Xiande's bones are so hard because Chairman Mao's great thoughts have tempered his iron will. Mei Xiande's comrade-in-arms, the heroic engineer Chen Wenyi, saw our great leader Chairman Mao today and said with boundless enthusiasm: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is your great thoughts that have made me, a naive child, grow into an engineer fighting on the front line of coastal defense. I will definitely study your books more diligently, listen to your words, and always act according to your instructions to be a good soldier of yours."

The deputy commander of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment," the battle hero Shu Jicheng, saw our greatest leader Chairman Mao again today. Chairman Mao shook his hand. He said excitedly: "On behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the regiment, I greet you and wish you eternal life!" The "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment" where Shu Jicheng is stationed is a combat collective that has always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's great instruction to "spare no effort and annihilate the invading enemy," they have fought bravely in the skies and seas of our motherland, invincible. They dare to fight hard battles and dare to fight hand-to-hand in the air. Over the years, this regiment has shot down and damaged more than thirty enemy planes. In this combat collective, Shu Jicheng has grown from a cowherd in the old society into a heroic pilot. In this unforgettable happy moment, he recalled his growth and said excitedly: "Only by constantly and consciously arming oneself with the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, using the 'Three Articles' as a weapon, using 'completely' and 'thoroughly' as a measure, using the three glorious images as examples, and using the revolutionary spirit of 'seizing the day' to thoroughly transform one's worldview, can one become a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

The representative of the navigation beacon team of a certain unit of the navy, which has been rated as one of the four good teams for six years, Yang Baogui, saw Chairman Mao, whom he has longed for day and night, and his heart surged with excitement. This team, which fights on the thousand-mile coastal defense line of the East China Sea, has been climbing steep cliffs and steep walls for years, turning in the dark reefs and dangerous shoals. "The beacon soldiers have Chairman Mao in their hearts, and they can shine like a lighthouse, unquenchable by the wind, unshakable by the waves, and shining wherever they are."

The political instructor of the "Sea Tiger Boat," Dai Xueming, who is famous in the East China Sea, saw the reddest sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, happily today and shouted excitedly. The officers and soldiers of the "Sea Tiger Boat" have "Chairman Mao's words in their hearts, overcome the 'self' and replace it with 'public,' and trample the ten-level waves under their feet!" In the battles to defend the motherland and the Cultural Revolution, they have established immortal merits for the people.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the greatest genius helmsman of the proletariat. The revolutionary ship has hope for liberation with you at the helm. Chairman Mao, we, the broad officers and soldiers of the navy, swear to you that we are infinitely loyal to you and will forever be loyal to you. Loyalty to you is loyalty to the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and loyalty to the great cause of communism.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We have a red heart that is infinitely loyal to you, daring to reach for the moon in the ninth heaven. Today, the hero soldier Gao Xiang, who was received by you, with a red heart that is infinitely loyal to you, shot down the so-called "last" American plane that invaded our country in the South China Sea with the fearless spirit of "bayonets meeting red."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We have a red heart that is infinitely loyal to you, daring to catch turtles in the five oceans! We have sunk one enemy ship after another that dared to invade. The heroic sailors of the "Pioneer Boat at Sea" patrol the coastal defense. When they encounter the American imperialist warship that tries to intrude into our sacred territorial waters, our "Pioneer Boat at Sea" despises this giant and stands in battle formation, issuing warnings. The enemy ship finally retreats, revealing its paper tiger nature. The soldiers, with their infinite loyalty to you, bravely defend the territorial waters of the motherland.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We have a red heart that is infinitely loyal to you, and in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we follow your great strategic deployment, thoroughly criticizing Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. Brigade Commander Wu Yi said: "Alive, we fight to defend your revolutionary line; dead, we sacrifice ourselves to defend your revolutionary line." This iron oath expresses the broad officers and soldiers' infinite love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for you.

The soldiers of the "Red Revolutionary Alliance" of the Navy Headquarters, in the great struggle between the two classes and the two lines, stood firmly on your revolutionary line, daring to revolt and protect, with clear banners, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, concentrating the greatest hatred on the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and launching fierce attacks on the capitalist headquarters, achieving one victory after another in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and establishing new merits for the people. Today, Chairman Mao shook hands with their representatives, giving them great encouragement and motivation. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's words and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We, the officers and soldiers who undertake the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries," have a red heart that is infinitely loyal to you, resolutely implementing and defending your proletarian revolutionary line. The representative from the Sanmen Fishery Small Team today accepted your reception. They said passionately: "Your revolutionary line has connected our red hearts with the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat. We will be the most loyal soldiers to defend your revolutionary line, unmovable by typhoons and unshakable by thunder."

Zhang Yimin, who has made many achievements, saw our great leader Chairman Mao for the tenth time today. He tightly held Chairman Mao's mighty hand, and a warm current spread through every nerve and cell in his body. Zhang Yimin said firmly: "We, the officers and soldiers of the navy, will forever be loyal to you, defending your glorious thoughts to the death, defending your revolutionary line to the death, and defending the proletarian headquarters led by you to the death! Forever and ever following you, we will carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end!"

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! What is the greatest in the world? Your kindness is the greatest! Who is the closest in the world? You are the closest! What is the happiest in the world? Seeing you is the greatest happiness!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The mountains are not higher than the blue sky, the rivers are not deeper than the ocean, the lamps are not brighter than the sun and the moon, your kindness is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea. Your great thoughts are more brilliant and glorious than the sun and the moon.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Our red hearts are pounding, and our blood is boiling. We are determined: to read your books for a lifetime, to listen to your words for a lifetime, to act according to your instructions for a lifetime, and to be your good soldiers for a lifetime.

The sailors of the four seas are all excited, and their passion surges like a tide. The mountains shout joyfully, and the sea sings loudly. The great news spreads like spring breeze over the vast coastal defense.

A thousand voices shout, ten thousand voices shout, the loudest slogan is: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

A thousand songs, ten thousand songs, the newest song is: "The great sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

    大海航行靠舵手
    ——记我们伟大领袖毛主席接见海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表
    一九六七年十二月三日晚十时十五分，最最幸福、最最难忘的时刻来到了！聚集在人民大会堂的海军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表们的心啊，就象大海的波涛，汹涌澎湃。
    一轮光焰无际的红太阳升起了！
    代表们欢声雷动，挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，千遍万遍地高呼：
    “毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席，满面红光，神采奕奕，频频地挥着巨手，迈着矫健的步伐，和他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及中央其他领导同志，来到战士们中间。
    “毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”这最最衷心的祝愿，最最响亮的口号声、欢呼声，象风雷激荡，响彻万里云霄，传遍五湖四海。毛主席啊毛主席，海军战士永远永远歌颂您，您是大海航行的舵手，人类解放的灯塔，天上最亮最亮的北斗星，我们心中最红最红的红太阳。我们对您老人家无限无限热爱，无限无限忠诚，蓝天做纸，大海做墨，写不尽；高山做鼓，江河做琴，唱不完。在波涛汹涌的大海上，我们高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，越唱越坚强；在烟雾弥漫的航程中，我们高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，越唱心越明。多少个白天黑夜，多少个清晨黄昏，我们唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，绕过暗礁，穿过峡道，乘风破浪，从胜利航行到新的胜利；我们唱着《大海航行靠舵手》迎来曙光，迎来黎明。今天，我们唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，迎来我们心中永远不落的最红最红的红太阳。
    多么幸福的时刻啊！毛主席啊，您老人家接见了海军的战士们，又单独接见了战斗英雄麦贤得、舒积成和屡立战功的张逸民，以及海直“红联总”战士代表，给了海军全体指战员无限的温暖，无穷的力量。这是您老人家对我们的最大最大的关怀，最大最大的信任，最大最大的鼓舞，最大最大的鞭策！
    多么幸福的时刻啊！海军战士洒下了幸福的泪花，在《毛主席语录》扉页上工工整整地记下这终生最最难忘的时刻。千言万语也难表达海军战士对您老人家的无限热爱，千言万语也难表达海军战士对您老人家的无限深情！毛主席啊毛主席，我们最最衷心地敬祝您万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
        毛主席啊，毛主席！海军战士最最热爱您
    朵朵葵花永远向着红太阳，颗颗红心永远向着毛主席。毛主席啊，毛主席！海军战士最最热爱您。大海波涛化成赞歌，也唱不尽对您老人家的无限深情。
    战斗英雄麦贤得最最热爱毛主席的心啊，就是千千万万战士热爱毛主席的心。麦贤得在战斗中想到毛主席，就有了无穷的力量，在他英勇负伤以后，第一次有面部表情是看到了毛主席像；第一次自觉的肢体动作是摸抚毛主席像；第一次有笑容是听到喊“毛主席万岁”；第一次写的字是“毛主席万岁”；第一次连续说出的三个字是“毛主席”；第一次独自唱的一支歌是《东方红》。今天，他终于实现了多少年来最最热切的心愿，第一次见到了毛主席。当毛主席和他握手的时候，他恨不得掏出他那颗红心献给毛主席，他纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    毛主席啊，在深深的海洋里潜航的战士们，时时刻刻想念您。他们说：“谁说深海里没有太阳，毛主席就是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，毛主席灿烂的阳光把我们潜艇里里外外照得亮堂堂。”
    巡航在祖国万里海疆的舰艇部队，日日夜夜想念着心中的红太阳，指战员们说：“有了红太阳，不怕风大浪狂，有了红太阳，不怕雾海茫茫，有了红太阳，我们永不迷航。”
    驾着战鹰飞翔在祖国万里海空的海军航空兵战士们，时刻想念毛主席。他们说：“飞机挂上毛主席像，舱里更比舱外亮。穿云破雾方向明，霹雳长空敌胆丧。”
    在远离北京的海岛上，战士们唱道：“想起毛主席，心里暖洋洋；挂上毛主席像，全岛亮堂堂。”他们把毛主席像挂到海岛的最高峰，让红太阳照得五洲四海红彤彤。
    日日夜夜守卫在海防前线的海军指战员，对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，千歌万曲唱不尽，千言万语讲不完。每个代表都带来了千万声问候，千万个祝愿，千万个誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的战斗决心。某部代表刘基堂来京前夕，发现挎包里有张纸条写着：“我值更去了，你到北京，请到天安门毛主席像前，代我祖祖辈辈喊三声毛主席万岁！”纸条背后还写着：“身居海岛，心向北京，跟着毛主席，永远干革命。”
    在“八·六”海战中荣立一等战功的某艇队指挥员王瑞昌，两个多月前，在天安门城楼上参加国庆观礼，见到了我们伟大领袖毛主席。今天，王瑞昌又幸福地来到了毛主席身边。他万分激动地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我们要永远沿着您老人家指引的革命航道，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！把光焰无际的毛泽东思想伟大旗帜插遍全世界！”
        毛主席啊，毛主席！您给我们指出了胜利的航向
    毛主席啊，您是世界革命人民的导师，您给世界人民指引着革命的航向。毛主席啊，您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，中国革命的航船，沿着您开辟的航向从胜利走向胜利。毛主席啊，您是我们最伟大的统帅，您亲手缔造和领导了举世无双的人民解放军。全国胜利以后，您老人家向我们发出伟大号令：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”今天，我们海军战士见到您，怎能不想起您老人家对我们无微不至的关怀！
    毛主席啊，您亲手缔造了人民海军，亲自规定了海军建设的方针、任务和建设规模，并在海军建设的各个关键时刻，及时地作出了英明指示。一九五○年，在万山群岛首次海战中，我们年青的海军在您光辉思想的指引下，用木船打败了敌人的军舰，您老人家立即表扬我们，给了我们无穷的力量。一九五三年，您亲临海军视察，在军舰上，我们和您老人家一起，度过了永生难忘的四天三夜。您勉励我们要爱军舰，爱岛，爱海洋。一九五八年，您老人家又视察了海军某造船厂和某舰艇部队，亲自登上我国制造的鱼雷艇，非常仔细地向战士们询问鱼雷的构造和威力。您老人家还多次接见了海军作战有功人员。您在接见“海空雄鹰团”副团长王鸿喜时，对“海空雄鹰团”为人民立下的卓越战功，表示高度的赞扬。您老人家还非常仔细地审阅过“八·六”海战的战斗总结。毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家无微不至的关怀，温暖了每一个海军指战员的心！
    千幸福，万幸福，在您老人家的亲切关怀下成长是最大最大的幸福。
    当年在军舰上见过毛主席的冯尚贤和王景南，今天又一次见到了毛主席。他们看到他老人家和当年一样非常非常健康，心中感到无限幸福。他们含着激动的泪花，回忆着十四年前毛主席在军舰上看望战士的情景。他们说：“毛主席真关心我们呀！毛主席一上舰，就挨个探望每一个战士，从驾驶台走到机舱，从炮位走到伙房，每一寸甲板，都留下了他老人家的光辉脚印。毛主席询问战士的冷暖，亲自到伙房尝了战士的饭菜。毛主席和战士一起合影的时候，还一再问后面的同志能不能照上，清楚不清楚。为了让每一个战士都享受到和伟大领袖一起拍照的幸福，毛主席花了一个多小时，分三次，和全体战士合了影。”王世虎今天见到毛主席后激动地说：“毛主席视察我们军舰十多年了，他老人家的光辉形象，一直铭刻在每个战士的心坎里；他老人家亲切的教导，时刻响在我们耳旁；他老人家的战斗号召，是我们前进的方向；他老人家的光辉思想，永远哺育着我们成长。十多年来，舰上人员换了一批又一批，毛主席登舰的情景，一代一代往下传。我们经常带领战士沿着毛主席上舰时走的路线，参观毛主席住过的舰位、船舱，把毛主席到过的每一个地方，都作为学习毛主席伟大革命实践的课堂。”
    毛主席啊，在您老人家的亲切关怀和培养下，我们海军从无到有，从小到大，从弱到强。我们海军全体指战员在您的光辉思想照耀下，克服了在革命化建设中和战斗中的重重困难，和广大人民群众一起，把我们伟大祖国的万里海疆，建成了一座牢不可破的钢铁长城。
    在著名的“八·六”海战中荣立一等战功的原“海上先锋艇”艇长石天定，在毛主席接见时，眼睛一眨也不眨地看着毛主席向大家亲切招手，看着毛主席的慈祥微笑。他热泪盈眶，纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”他回想起“海上先锋艇”在毛主席的光辉思想哺育下，在战斗中成长的幕幕情景：“海上先锋艇”在万山群岛打第一仗时，什么“夜间航行”，什么“航海作战规章”，样样都不摸门。但是，他们用毛泽东思想武装头脑，有勇敢不怕死的精神，用木壳船，凭刺刀、手榴弹就跟敌人的大军舰干了起来。战士们端着明晃晃的刺刀冲上敌人的所谓“海上霸王”舰，吓得敌人纷纷投降。十多年来，“海上先锋艇”的指战员始终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在威震中外的“八·六”海战中，他们一边出击，一边朗读毛主席语录：“要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”，发扬了我军近战夜战的光荣传统，冒着敌人炮火，把炮艇一直开到敌舰“鼻子”底下，和兄弟艇一起，打沉两艘敌舰。石天定在毛主席接见后，极其兴奋地说：“我们先锋艇的成长，一时一刻、一分一秒也离不开毛泽东思想。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们海军战士在沿着您指引的航向胜利前进的时候，并不是风平浪静的。中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行资产阶级军事路线，搞什么“技术第一”、“大比武”，掀起一阵又一阵狂风恶浪，妄图把我军建设引到邪路上去。无限忠于毛主席革命路线的广大指战员，和他们作了针锋相对的斗争，彻底粉碎了他们的种种阴谋活动。支队长武毅今天见到我们伟大统帅毛主席，一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”这个支队在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，坚持用毛泽东思想教育部队、训练部队、指挥作战。他们坚决地抵制了罗瑞卿反对突出政治，反对部队学习毛主席著作，反对四个第一的资产阶级军事路线，他们不怕压，不受骗，始终坚持毛主席的军事路线，大破洋教条，大立毛泽东思想。他们说：“毛泽东思想是我们的灵魂，最坚决地执行毛主席的革命路线就是胜利。”
        毛主席啊，毛主席！您的光辉思想哺育着我们成长
    在人民大会堂，代表们沉浸在幸福的狂欢中。
    “毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！万万岁！”的口号声，一阵高过一阵。在这最最幸福的时刻，多少战士噙着幸福的泪花，回忆着自己成长的历程！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林副主席，为海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的光辉题词，最好最好地表达了海军广大指战员的心愿。
    我们遵照林副主席的指示，掀起了群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，人人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。毛主席的光辉思想哺育我们成长，毛主席的伟大形象鼓舞我们胜利向前，毛主席的光辉著作，指引我们“掏尽红心为人民，坚守海疆杀敌人”。
    麦贤得所在艇的艇长崔福俊，满怀激情地见到了毛主席。千言万语涌心头。他说，麦贤得的骨头为什么这么硬？是毛主席的伟大思想铸成了他的钢筋铁骨。麦贤得的战友、英雄轮机兵陈文乙，今天，见到了伟大领袖毛主席，无限激情地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！是您的伟大思想使我由一个幼稚的孩子，成长为一个战斗在海防最前线的轮机兵。我一定要更好地读您老人家的书，听您老人家的话，永远照您老人家的指示办事，努力作您老人家的好战士。”
    “海空雄鹰团”副团长、战斗英雄舒积成，今天又一次见到了我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席。毛主席和他握了手。他激动地说：“我代表全团指战员向您老人家问好，祝您老人家万寿无疆！”舒积成所在的“海空雄鹰团”是一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的战斗集体。在坚决执行毛主席“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”的伟大指示中，纵横祖国海空，英勇作战，所向无敌。他们敢于打硬仗，敢于空中拚刺刀。几年来，这个团击落击伤敌机三十多架。在这个战斗的集体里，舒积成从一个旧社会的放牛娃，成为一个英雄的飞行员。在这永生难忘的幸福时刻，他回想起自己成长的道路，无比激动地说：“只有不断地、自觉地用光焰无际的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，以‘老三篇’为武器，以‘完全’‘彻底’为尺子，以三个光辉形象为榜样，用‘只争朝夕’的革命精神，彻底改造世界观，才能当一名毛主席的好战士。”
    海军某部六年被评为四好的航标队的代表杨宝贵，见到了日夜想念的毛主席，心如潮涌，热血沸腾。这支战斗在东海千里海防线上的航标队，常年累月地攀悬崖，登陡壁，辗转在暗礁险滩之间。“航标兵心中有了毛主席，就能象灯塔那样，风吹不灭，浪打不倒，安在那里就在那里闪闪发光。”
    扬威东海的“海上猛虎艇”指导员戴学明，今天幸福地见到了世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，激动得欢呼跳跃。“海上猛虎艇”的指战员，“心里牢记毛主席的话，斗倒‘私’字换‘公’字，十级风浪踩脚下！”在保卫祖国和保卫文化大革命的战斗中，为人民立下了不朽的功勋。
        毛主席啊，毛主席！我们无限忠于您
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是无产阶级最伟大的天才舵手。革命的航船有您老人家掌舵，人类的解放就有了希望。毛主席啊，我们海军广大指战员向您宣誓，我们无限忠于您，永远忠于您。忠于您老人家，就是忠于中国人民和世界人民的根本利益，就是忠于伟大的共产主义事业。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们有了一颗无限忠于您的红心，敢上九天揽月。今天，被您老人家接见的英雄战士高翔，怀着一颗无限忠于您的红心，在南海上空以“刺刀见红”的大无畏精神，把侵入我国的所谓美国“末代”飞机，打得粉身碎骨。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们有了一颗无限忠于您的红心，敢下五洋捉鳖！打沉了一艘又一艘胆敢来犯的敌舰。英雄的“海上先锋艇”的水兵们，巡逻海疆，遇上企图窜犯我神圣领海的美帝国主义军舰，我们的“海上先锋艇”蔑视这个庞然大物，严阵以待，发出警告，敌舰终于溜走，现出了纸老虎原形。战士们就是怀着对您老人家的无限忠心，英勇捍卫着祖国的领海。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们有了一颗无限忠于您的红心，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们紧跟您老人家的伟大战略部署，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿。某部支队长武毅同志说：“活，为捍卫您老人家革命路线而战斗；死，为捍卫您老人家革命路线而献身。”这钢铁誓言表达了广大指战员对您老人家的无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜。
    海军直属机关“红联总”的战士们，在两个阶级、两条路线的大搏斗中，坚定地站在您老人家革命路线一边，敢革敢保，旗帜鲜明，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，把最大仇恨集中到党内最大一小撮走资派身上，向资产阶级司令部猛烈开火，取得了一个又一个胜利，在无产阶级文化大革命中，为人民立了新功。今天，毛主席和他们的代表握手，给了他们以巨大的鼓舞，巨大的动力，他们决心听毛主席的话，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们担负“三支”“两军”光荣任务的指战员，有一颗无限忠于您的红心，坚决贯彻和捍卫您的无产阶级革命路线。来自三门支渔小分队的代表，今天接受了您的接见。他们满怀激情地说：“您的革命路线，把我们和无产阶级革命派广大革命群众的颗颗红心紧紧地连在一起。我们要做保卫您的革命路线的最最忠诚的战士，台风刮不动，霹雳震不倒。”
    屡建战功的张逸民，今天是第十次见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。他紧紧握住毛主席的巨手，一股暖流传遍了他的每一根神经，每一个细胞。张逸民坚定地说：“我们海军指战员，永远永远忠于您，誓死捍卫您的光辉思想，誓死捍卫您的革命路线，誓死捍卫以您为首的无产阶级司令部！永生永世紧紧跟着您，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！世界上什么最大？您老人家的恩情最大最大！世界上什么人最亲？您老人家最亲最亲！世界上什么最幸福？见到您老人家是最大最大的幸福！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！山高高不过蓝天，河深深不过海洋，灯亮亮不过日月，您老人家的恩情啊，比天高，比海深，您老人家的伟大思想比日月更灿烂辉煌。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们红心激跳，热血沸腾。我们决心：一辈子读您的书，一辈子听您的话，一辈子照您的指示办事，一辈子做您的好战士。
    四海战士齐欢腾，激情似潮热泪涌。群山纵情欢呼，大海放声歌唱。特大喜讯象春风一样吹遍万里海疆。
    千声高呼，万声高呼，最响亮的口号是：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    千支歌儿，万支歌儿，最新的歌儿是：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
