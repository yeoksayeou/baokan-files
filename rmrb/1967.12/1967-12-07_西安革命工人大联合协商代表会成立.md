The West China Revolutionary Workers' Great United Consultative Assembly is Established

Revolutionary workers and the People's Liberation Army hold a rally to celebrate, vowing to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize and repudiate revisionism, break down petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, and make new contributions to achieving the great alliance and the three-in-one combination in the West China region and Shaanxi Province.

Editor's Note: The powerful east wind of the great situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought good news from the Northwest Plateau: the West China Revolutionary Workers' Great United Consultative Assembly has been established. This is a major achievement of the glorious West China working class in learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combining learning with practice, and taking immediate and decisive action. We extend our warm congratulations!

Several revolutionary worker mass organizations in the West China region have taken the lead in the great alliance of the region by hoisting the great banner of "criticize and repudiate revisionism." This once again vividly proves the boundless power of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, proving that as long as petty-bourgeois factionalism is seriously overcome and proletarian party spirit is genuinely strengthened, Chairman Mao's latest instructions can be learned and applied well, truly implemented.

We believe that under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and with the resolute support of the People's Liberation Army, the working class of the West China region will make even greater contributions in achieving the great alliance and the three-in-one combination in the West China region and Shaanxi Province, advancing the great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation in various units, and promoting revolution and production in the great struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, West China, December 6th: In the unprecedented great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country, the revolutionary worker mass organizations in the West China region, with "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, have united on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought and established the West China Revolutionary Workers' Great United Consultative Assembly. This is a victory song of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, a victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the afternoon of the second day, more than ten million revolutionary workers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in the West China region held a grand rally to celebrate. The responsible comrades of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Committee, Huang Jingyao, Hu Wei, Fang Shengpu, and Bai Xinfu, attended the meeting.

The meeting began with the majestic melody of "The East Is Red." When the executive chairman of the meeting announced the formal establishment of the West China Revolutionary Workers' Great United Consultative Assembly, the entire venue erupted in enthusiastic, stormy applause. The people shouted over and over again: "Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" "Long live, long live, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!"

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the West China region, like the rest of the country, has an unprecedentedly good situation, and it is getting better and better. Several revolutionary worker mass organizations in the West China region have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, criticized and repudiated revisionism, broken down petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and exposed the enemy's plots to sabotage the great alliance. After multiple heart-to-heart talks and consultations, they took the initiative to make self-criticisms and finally united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary principles, establishing the West China Revolutionary Workers' Great United Consultative Assembly. They also established united offices for the great alliance, great criticism, and promoting revolution and production in the West China region, laying the foundation for the great alliance in the West China region.

The chairman of the meeting spoke with immense excitement. He pointed out that the establishment of the West China Revolutionary Workers' Great United Consultative Assembly is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and also a result of the strong support and help from the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Committee of the People's Liberation Army. Its establishment is a heavy blow to the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. He said, we workers must firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, further criticize and repudiate revisionism, consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination, shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, closely follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Comrade Huang Jingyao, Commander of the Shaanxi Military Region, on behalf of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Committee of the People's Liberation Army, extended the warmest congratulations to the meeting. In his speech, he praised the working class of West China for their immortal achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the West China region over the past more than a year. He hoped that the working class of the West China region would better follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, continue to strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, further heighten revolutionary vigilance, and strive for new and greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Representatives of revolutionary students from universities and colleges spoke, saying that the glorious working class, with its honorable traditions, takes the lead in the great alliance, setting an example for the great alliance in the West China region. We should humbly learn from our revolutionary worker comrades, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and make new contributions to achieving the great alliance and the three-in-one combination in the West China region and Shaanxi Province.

The meeting, amid extremely enthusiastic cheers and applause, passed a telegram of good news to Chairman Mao.
