A black friend who had just arrived in China from Haiti was overjoyed upon receiving the news that he would be participating in the National Day celebrations. However, there was one thing that troubled him greatly. What was it? It turned out that he had only just arrived in China and did not know how to speak Chinese, let alone shout "Long Live Chairman Mao!" in Chinese. This made him very sad.

What should he do? He found a translator and insisted that the translator teach him to shout, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" The translator taught him, and he learned very seriously. Until late at night, he finally mastered it. The next day, he was afraid he would forget, so he got up early in the morning and stood alone in front of Chairman Mao's colorful portrait, repeatedly shouting, "Chairman Mao—long live! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!"

The most joyous moment arrived. The loudspeaker announced the most thrilling news: Chairman Mao had arrived! Chairman Mao had arrived! As soon as he saw Chairman Mao, he was so happy that tears streamed down his face. He continuously shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!" He pulled the translator's hand excitedly and said, "Today, I was able to see the great teacher Chairman Mao. This is the greatest happiness of my life..."

    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    一位刚从海地来我国的黑人朋友，接到参加国庆观礼的喜讯后，高兴极了。但有一件事难住了他，使他感到难过。这到底是怎么一回事呢？原来，他刚来我国不久，还不会说中国话，更不用说用中国话喊“毛主席万岁”了。因此，他很难过。
    怎么办呢？他找到了翻译，一定要翻译教他喊：“毛主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！”翻译教，他就很认真地学。直到深夜，他终于学会了。第二天，他怕忘了，一大早就起了床，独自一人站在毛主席彩色画像前一次又一次地高呼：“毛—主—席—万—岁！祝—毛—主—席—万—寿—无—疆！”
    最幸福的时刻到来了。扩音器里传来了最最激动人心的喜讯，毛主席来了！毛主席来了！他一看见毛主席，就高兴得热泪直往外淌。他不停地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”他拉着翻译的手激动地说：“今天，我能见到伟大导师毛主席，这是我一生最大最大的幸福……”。
