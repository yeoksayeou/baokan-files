Soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army engaged in the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks have been studying the experiences of the 834th Unit in supporting the leftist movement at the Beijing Knitting Factory. They have been closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and using the three principles of supporting the leftist movement as their guide to action.

The New China News Agency reported on the 18th that soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, who are fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks, have been extensively and deeply studying the experiences of the 834th Unit in supporting the leftist movement. They have combined their own practices, repeatedly studied and discussed the three principles that the 834th Unit followed under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao in their support work at the Beijing Knitting Factory: (1) vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought, conduct in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work; (2) do not hastily express opinions, conduct investigations and research, and if both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, gradually unite them; (3) learn from the worker masses, do not fear making mistakes, correct them if wrong, and care for the lives of the masses. They have used these three principles as a mirror to summarize their experiences and lessons, identify gaps, and express their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, implement these three principles in the "Three Supports, Two Military" work, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the advanced experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory was publicized, it sparked a strong response among the broad support-left personnel of the People's Liberation Army's ground, naval, and air forces. The various headquarters, military branches, and units of the Beijing, Shenyang, Jinan, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, Xinjiang, and Tibet regions immediately organized study sessions. Many units quickly notified their subordinate units executing the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks in factories, rural areas, and schools to learn from the support-left work experience of the 834th Unit and implement it in action. Broad masses of soldiers and officers held discussions and lectures, organized propaganda teams to go deep into factories, rural areas, and schools for extensive propaganda. They said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the Beijing Knitting Factory is a model that embodies the proletarian revolutionary line and strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao. The 834th Unit is a red flag in support-left work. They have set a brilliant example for the nation's military and civilians. We must learn from the comrades of the 834th Unit and the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, with an unyielding class sentiment for the great leader Chairman Mao, implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

During the study and discussion, the broad masses of soldiers and officers reviewed and summarized the experiences of their support-left work over the past year, launching a campaign to identify gaps.

The Beijing Garrison Party Committee issued a decision, calling on all soldiers and officers executing the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks in the capital to take the experience of the 834th Unit as a model, combine it with their actual situations, conduct self-examinations, identify weak links, and formulate specific measures. Soldiers and officers executing military training tasks at the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute held "Three Remembrances, Three Comparisons" activities during their study: remembrance of the previous phase of military training work, comparison of how tightly they promoted Mao Zedong Thought; remembrance of helping revolutionary teachers and students grasp the direction of struggle, comparison of how meticulously they conducted ideological and political work; remembrance of the degree of ideological revolutionization, comparison of how humbly they learned from the masses and were willing to be students of the masses. The more they studied, the more enthusiastic they became. The soldiers and officers said: The experience of the 834th Unit is excellent in every way, but the most fundamental aspect is their loyalty to Chairman Mao. We must learn from their loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, summarize our support-left work, promote our achievements, correct our shortcomings, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve greater successes in the current great situation of the Cultural Revolution. The Party Committee of the Third Battalion of a certain unit in Anshan found gaps and formulated measures to improve support-left work: (1) Use the three principles as a guide to action, conduct in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work; (2) Humble learning from the proletarian revolutionary factions, actively seek opinions from the masses, strengthen military-civilian unity, and always be students of the masses; (3) Use the experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory as an example, do a good job in the ideological and political work of revolutionary mass organizations, and further promote revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination.

Soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Military" tasks, while seriously studying the three principles implemented by the 834th Unit in support-left work, are also enthusiastically helping revolutionary masses learn and apply the experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory. In recent days, many military representatives participating in various levels of revolutionary committees have actively suggested to the standing committees to study and apply the experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory as a special topic. Many support-left personnel organized leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to adopt various forms such as study classes, experience-sharing meetings, and discussion meetings, guiding them to learn and apply the experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Soldiers and officers of the 834th Unit organized a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team as soon as they entered the factory, vigorously promoting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to take root in the minds of the masses. This is the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team performing for the worker masses during their spare time in the workshop.

Being students of the masses and learning from the people, this is Chairman Mao's consistent great thought. The support-left personnel of the 834th Unit firmly followed Chairman Mao's instructions, living among the worker masses, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism together with the worker masses, exposing their selfishness without fear of embarrassment, fighting against selfishness without fear of pain, comparing their thoughts with the worker masses, seeking help from the masses, absorbing nutrition from the masses, accelerating their own ideological transformation, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the worker masses, and strengthening military-civilian relations. This is the support-left personnel discussing their experiences in fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism with the worker masses.

　　步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    把支左工作三原则作为行动指
    南解放军“三支”“两军”广大指战员认真学习八三四一部队在北京针织总厂支左的经验
    新华社十八日讯　战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线上的人民解放军广大指战员，连日来，广泛深入地学习了八三四一部队支左工作的经验。他们结合自己的实践，反复学习讨论了八三四一部队遵循伟大领袖毛主席的一贯教导，在北京针织总厂支左工作中所贯彻执行的三条原则：（一）大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作。（二）不匆匆忙忙急于表态，经过调查研究，如果两派都是革命的群众组织，就逐步地把他们联合起来。（三）向工人群众学习，不怕犯错误，错了就改。关心群众的生活。并以这三条原则为镜子，认真总结经验教训，找出差距。广大指战员表示，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“三支”“两军”工作中落实这三条原则，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
    北京针织总厂的先进经验传出后，激起了人民解放军陆海空三军广大支左人员的强烈反响。人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种、北京、沈阳、济南、南京、武汉、广州、福州、兰州、成都、昆明、新疆、西藏等部队，立即组织学习。许多部队用最快的速度通知在工矿企业、农村、学校执行“三支”“两军”任务的所属部队把八三四一部队的支左工作经验学到手，落实在行动上。广大指战员纷纷联系实际进行座谈讨论，开讲用会，组织宣传队深入工厂、农村和学校广泛宣传。他们说，北京针织总厂的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是体现我们伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和战略部署的一个典范。八三四一部队是支左工作的一面红旗。他们为全国军民树立了光辉的榜样。我们一定要向八三四一部队的同志和北京针织总厂的革命职工学习，以无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在学习和讨论中，广大指战员回顾和总结了一年来支左工作的经验，掀起一个找差距的热潮。
    北京卫戍区党委作出决定，号召在首都执行“三支”“两军”任务的全体指战员，要以八三四一部队的经验为样板，联系实际，对照检查，找出薄弱环节，订出具体措施。在北京邮电学院执行军训任务的指战员，学习中开展了“三忆三比”活动：忆前一段的军训工作，比自己宣传毛泽东思想抓得紧不紧；忆帮助革命师生掌握斗争大方向的情况，比自己思想政治工作做得细不细；忆思想革命化的程度，比自己虚心向群众学习、甘当群众小学生够不够。大家越学劲头越足。指战员们说：八三四一部队的经验有千好万好，最根本的就是对毛主席赤胆忠心，紧跟毛主席寸步不离。我们一定要学习他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一片赤胆忠心，总结我们的支左工作，发扬成绩，纠正缺点，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在当前文化大革命一派大好形势下作出更大的成绩来。鞍山驻军某部三营党委，找出了差距以后，订出了改进支左工作的措施：一、把三条原则当作行动指南，做好深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作；二、虚心地向无产阶级革命派学习，主动征求群众意见，加强军民团结，永远做群众的小学生；三、以北京针织总厂的经验为榜样，做好革命群众组织的思想政治工作，进一步促进革命大联合和革命三结合。
    战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线上的广大指战员，在认真学习八三四一部队在支左工作中所贯彻执行的三条原则的同时，还满腔热情地帮助革命群众学习和运用北京针织总厂的经验。连日来，许多参加各级革命委员会的部队代表，积极建议常委会，把学习和运用北京针织总厂的经验列为专题进行研究。许多支左人员组织革命群众组织负责人，采取学习班、讲用会、座谈会等多种方式，引导他们学好、用好北京针织总厂经验，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。（附图片）
    八三四一部队支左人员一进厂就组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，大力宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，宣传毛主席的伟大战略部署，宣传毛主席的最新指示，让毛泽东思想在群众头脑里扎根。这是毛泽东思想宣传队，利用业余时间在车间给工人群众演出。

    做群众的小学生，向人民群众学习，这是毛主席的一贯的伟大思想。八三四一部队支左人员坚决按照毛主席这一指示办事，他们生活在工人群众中，与工人群众一起斗私批修，亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕痛，把自己的思想同工人群众见面，取得群众帮助，从群众中吸取营养，加速了自己的思想改造，促进了工人群众的思想革命化，也密切了军民关系。这是支左人员和工人群众一起在谈斗私批修的体会。
