In 1965, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the Thai people's armed forces fired the first shot of armed struggle in Na Kha County. Now, the flames of people's armed struggle have spread across northeastern, southern, central, and northern Thailand. The main reason why the Thai people's armed forces have been able to persist and grow stronger is that from the day they were born, they have taken the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong as their guide, relied on the peasants, established rural base areas, and surrounded the cities from the countryside, preparing to ultimately seize national power.

For many years, U.S. imperialism has turned Thailand into its new colony, a military base for bombing Vietnam, invading Laos, threatening Southeast Asia, and threatening China. The Thai reactionary ruling clique has continually sold out national sovereignty and national interests, willingly serving as U.S. imperialism's running dog in its aggression against Asia. Under the plundering of the Thanom-Praphat clique, the Thai people are suffering in a sea of fire. Thailand, once known for its abundant rice and fish, now has hundreds of thousands of starving people. Last year, in the northeast alone, many people had to rely on digging wild yams and even eating dead rats to survive. The Thai people have risen up! Workers are striking, farmers are seizing land, and students are boycotting classes. Leaflets exposing the reactionary rule of the U.S.-Thai alliance are flying through the streets of Bangkok. The revolutionary people of Thailand have taken up arms to fight! "Drive out U.S. imperialism," the red flags wave on Phu Phan Mountain (northeast guerrilla zone); "Overthrow Thanom," the voices of the Thai people shaking the heavens with their battle cries.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, our soldiers continuously raise their class consciousness by studying Marxism-Leninism and the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought.

The Thai people's armed forces pay close attention to the ideological work of every soldier, conducting various forms of political and ideological education for the soldiers. Through "speaking bitterness," they raise the soldiers' class and political consciousness, transform their worldviews, and instill in every soldier a thorough revolutionary spirit. Therefore, many "four-good" combat teams, "four-good" armed propaganda teams, and "five-good" soldiers have emerged within the people's armed forces. Soldiers who study Mao Zedong's works well can recite the "Three Articles" and apply them in daily life.

After every "encirclement and suppression" campaign and every battle, the Thai people's armed forces, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "learning war from war," summarize their combat experiences. We have come to understand that the better we grasp and apply Mao Zedong's military thought, the greater our victories will be.

The Thai people's armed forces have strict organizational discipline, with three main rules and eight points for attention. Our soldiers must be able to fight, produce, and do mass work.

Because the Thai people's armed forces regard political work as the lifeline of all work, the soldiers' morale is high. Despite the fact that the U.S. and its running dog, the Thanom-Praphat clique, are armed to the teeth with modern weapons, they reveal their paper tiger nature as soon as they engage in combat.

The people's war led by the Communist Party of Thailand is guided by the military thought of Chairman Mao's "On Protracted War."

The Thai people's armed forces follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our strategy is to 'use one to defeat ten,' and our tactics are to 'use ten to defeat one.' 'The main goal is to annihilate the enemy's effective forces, not to conserve or seize cities and places.' Since the people's armed forces began conducting guerrilla warfare, the enemy's repeated "encirclement and suppression" campaigns have all failed. This is because the people's armed forces strive to concentrate their main forces to launch sudden attacks on the enemy's dispersed forces, defeating the enemy one by one.

The people's armed forces also employ Chairman Mao's sixteen-character strategy: "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy halts, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue." Relying on this guerrilla tactic of sixteen characters, the people's armed forces have dealt heavy blows to the enemy's military police and reactionary "volunteer defense forces." The commander of the first joint command of the political, military, and police forces conducting suppression activities in Nakhon Phanom and Sakhon Nakhon provinces lamented to reporters on July 14 this year: "The Communists actively use Mao Zedong's sixteen-character tactics, often launching attacks at night, during mealtimes, or on weekends."

The people's armed forces, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "in strategy, we must despise all enemies; in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously," make thorough preparations in both thought and military affairs before every military operation. They must understand their own subjective forces and the enemy's objective forces, understand the situation of the masses, and the terrain of the area where they are to carry out their combat missions. They must repeatedly explain the tactics used in each operation, and every soldier's weapons, ammunition, food, and other equipment must be fully prepared. The battle plan must be thoroughly discussed democratically by the soldiers. In this way, we can achieve what Chairman Mao taught: "Know the enemy and know yourself, and you can fight a hundred battles with no danger of defeat."

The people's armed forces, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "self-reliance," obtain weapons and ammunition from the enemy as much as possible. The people's armed forces fight while producing, and in terms of food, they have largely achieved self-sufficiency.

The Thai people's armed forces, by applying Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on people's war, have achieved continuous victories in battle, smashing the enemy's repeated large "encirclement and suppression" campaigns. The people's armed forces, using tactics of ambush and attacking enemy strongholds, and destroying transportation and communication lines, have always maintained the initiative, achieving brilliant results in the past two years. According to recent incomplete statistics, the people's armed forces have engaged in over 500 battles with the enemy in the past two years, annihilating more than 1,000 enemy soldiers and police, including a colonel and a batch of American soldiers.

Currently, the people's armed forces are active in vast areas of 28 out of 71 provinces in northeastern, southern, central, and northern Thailand.

Let me give an example to illustrate that even if one only learns a little of Mao Zedong Thought, if one can grasp and apply it well, it can have an immediate effect.

Soldier Sang, 35 years old, is a poor peasant. After joining the people's armed forces, he underwent a short period of political and military training, seeing clearly the essential difference between the reactionary army that oppresses the people and the people's armed forces, and understanding the three main tasks of the people's army: fighting, doing mass work, and production. In battle, he remembers that annihilating the enemy is to preserve oneself, and only by annihilating the enemy's effective forces can the people's armed forces develop and grow stronger. This is Chairman Mao's teaching.

The day to test the application of Mao Zedong Thought has come. The village's spy led the reactionary police to search everywhere for the people's armed forces. Sang, who was on guard duty, spotted the enemy first. He immediately hid and at the same time called his comrades to report to the camp. What he remembered was "annihilate the enemy's effective forces," "annihilate a little, feel a little better; annihilate more, feel much better;..." He aimed his gun, and when the enemy approached, he fired, shooting four bullets, with the first bullet hitting the spy. As a result, three enemies were killed and one was wounded. The enemies immediately fled in disarray. Sang was called the "sniper."

The Thai people's armed forces have grown stronger by relying on Mao Zedong Thought. The great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made the cadres and soldiers of the Thai people's armed forces pay even more attention to and emphasize the effort to study Mao Zedong Thought, apply it in practice, transform their worldviews, and become red soldiers who will never change color, to prevent the emergence of revisionism within their own ranks. Therefore, we firmly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. We firmly believe that China, as the world's revolutionary base, will never change color and will become stronger and stronger.

The initial victories of the Thai people's armed struggle have proven that U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphat puppet clique are paper tigers. The Thai people have the confidence to thoroughly defeat them.

The Communist Party of Thailand's proclamation on its 24th anniversary states: "At present, the enemy's forces are temporarily stronger than ours, so our struggle must go through a long, arduous, sacrificial, and tortuous process, and we must actively rely on and mobilize the strength of the entire people to participate in this struggle."

Therefore, we Thai people must make use of the favorable domestic and international situation, accelerate the expansion of patriotic forces against U.S. imperialism and domestic reactionaries, and strive to learn from the rich experiences of the peoples of various countries who are waging armed struggles. We will use people's war to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Thanom-Praphat clique.

The Thai people are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with all oppressed peoples and nations of the world, advancing bravely along the path of people's war as indicated by Chairman Mao!

    泰国人民武装力量高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进
    泰国　妮达
    一九六五年，在泰国共产党的领导下，泰国人民武装力量在那家县打响了武装斗争的第一枪。现在，人民武装斗争的星星之火已经燃遍泰国东北部、南部、中部和北部。泰国人民武装力量能够坚持并发展壮大，最主要的原因是泰国人民武装力量自从它诞生的第一天起，就以光辉的毛泽东思想为指针，依靠农民，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，并准备最后夺取全国政权。
    多年来，美帝国主义把泰国变成它的新型殖民地，变成它轰炸越南、侵略老挝、威胁东南亚和威胁中国的军事基地。泰国反动统治集团不断出卖国家主权和民族利益，甘心充当美帝国主义侵略亚洲的走狗。在他侬—巴博集团的搜刮下，泰国人民处于水深火热之中。号称“田里有米，水里有鱼”的富饶的泰国，大批人民陷于挨饿的境地。去年全国就有几十万饥民，在东北部有许多人要靠采竹笋、挖野薯甚至吃死老鼠充饥。泰国人民起来斗争了！工人罢工，农民夺地，学生罢课的斗争此伏彼起，揭露美泰反动统治的传单在曼谷的街道纷飞。泰国革命人民拿起枪杆子来战斗了！“赶走美帝”，普潘山（东北部游击区）上的红旗飘扬；“打倒他侬”，泰国人民的杀敌之声震天动地。
    在泰国共产党的领导下，我们的战士不断提高阶级觉悟，就是由于学习了马克思列宁主义，学习了当代马列主义的顶峰毛泽东思想。
    泰国人民武装力量关心每个战士的思想工作，对战士进行多种形式的政治思想教育，通过“诉苦”来提高战士的阶级觉悟和政治觉悟，改造世界观，使每个战士都树立彻底革命的精神。因此，人民武装力量中涌现出了许多“四好武工队”、“四好武装宣传队”和“五好战士”。毛泽东著作学习得好的战士，能够背诵“老三篇”，并在日常生活中活学活用。
    在每次的反“围剿”和每次战斗之后，泰国人民武装力量根据毛泽东主席“从战争学习战争”的教导，注意总结战斗经验。我们体会到，掌握和运用毛泽东的军事思想越好，我们的战斗就会取得更大的胜利。
    泰国人民武装力量有严格的组织纪律，有三大纪律，八项注意。我们的战士必须会打仗，会生产，会做群众工作。
    由于泰国人民武装力量把政治工作作为各项工作的生命线，所以战士们的士气很高。尽管美帝及其走狗他侬—巴博集团以现代化武器武装到了牙齿，可是一打就现出它们纸老虎的原形。
    泰国共产党所领导的人民战争，是以毛泽东主席《论持久战》的军事思想为指导原则的。
    泰国人民武装力量遵循了毛泽东主席的教导：“我们的战略是‘以一当十’，我们的战术是‘以十当一’”。“以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标，不以保守或夺取城市和地方为主要目标。”自从人民武装力量开始进行游击战争以来，敌人的一次又一次“围剿”都遭到失败。这是因为人民武装力量力求集中主要兵力，突然袭击敌人分散的兵力，各个击破敌人。
    人民武装力量还运用了毛泽东主席的十六字诀：“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追。”依靠这十六字诀游击战术，人民武装力量给敌人军警和反动的“保卫国土自愿队”以狠狠的打击。在那空拍侬府和沙功那空府进行镇压活动的政、军、警第一联合指挥部的指挥官，今年七月十四日悲叹地对记者说：“共产党积极地运用了毛泽东十六字诀的战术，往往是在夜里、在吃饭的时候或周末休息的时候进行袭击。”
    人民武装力量按照毛主席“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的教导，每次军事行动之前，都要在思想上和军事上作全面准备，要了解自己的主观力量和敌人的客观力量，了解群众的情况及前往执行作战任务地区的地形，要反复交代每次行动时所采用的战术，同时每个战士的武器弹药、粮食和其他装备都要准备齐全。作战计划则要经过战士充分的民主讨论。这样就可以做到如毛主席所教导的：“知彼知己，百战不殆。”
    人民武装力量遵循毛泽东主席“自力更生”的教导，武器、弹药尽量取之于敌。人民武装力量边战斗边生产，在粮食方面大部分已能作到自给。
    泰国人民武装力量由于运用了毛泽东同志关于人民战争的思想，在战斗中取得了不断的胜利，粉碎了敌人多次的大“围剿”。人民武装力量用伏击、袭击敌人的据点，破坏运输线交通线的战术，一直掌握了主动权，两年来取得了辉煌的战果。据最近不完全统计，人民武装力量两年来同敌人作战五百多次，消灭敌军警一千多名，其中包括上校军衔的敌人军官和一批美军。
    目前，人民武装力量已在泰国东北部、南部、中部和北部，全国七十一个府中的二十八个府的广大地区进行活动。
    下面让我举个例子来说明，学习毛泽东思想那怕是只学一点，但如果能够很好的掌握和运用的话，就能立竿见影。
    战士桑，三十五岁，是个贫民。他参加人民武装力量以后，经过短期的政治和军事学习，看清了压迫人民的反动军队和人民武装力量之间有着本质区别，认识到人民军队的三大任务：打仗、做群众工作和生产。在战斗中，他铭记消灭敌人就是保存自己，只有消灭敌人的有生力量，人民武装力量才能发展壮大。这是毛泽东主席的教导。
    检验运用毛泽东思想的一天来到了。村里的特务领着反动警察到处搜索人民武装力量。正在放哨的桑同志先发现敌人，他马上隐蔽起来，同时叫他的战友到营地去报告。他所牢记的就是“要歼灭敌人的有生力量”、“消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；……”他举枪瞄准，等到敌人走近的时候，便开枪射击，连射四发子弹，头一发就打中特务，结果有三名敌人被打死，一名被打伤。敌人立即纷纷逃命。桑战士被称为“神枪手”。
    泰国人民武装力量，是依靠毛泽东思想得到发展壮大的。中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响，使泰国人民武装力量的指战员更加重视和强调努力学习毛泽东思想，活学活用，改造世界观，成为永不变色的红色战士，以防止在自己的队伍中产生修正主义。因此，我们对毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，表示最坚决的支持。我们坚信，作为世界革命根据地的中国将永不变色并将日益强大。
    泰国人民武装斗争所取得的初步胜利，证明了美帝国主义和他侬—巴博傀儡集团都是纸老虎。泰国人民有信心能够彻底地打败他们。
    泰国共产党成立二十四周年的文告指出：“目前敌人的力量暂时还比我们处于优势，因此，我们的斗争必须经历一段艰苦、牺牲、长期和曲折的过程，必须积极依靠和动员全国人民的一切力量参加这一斗争。”
    因此，我们泰国人民必须利用国内外的大好形势，加紧扩大反对美帝国主义和国内反动派的爱国力量，并努力学习正在进行武装斗争的各国人民的丰富经验，用人民战争彻底打败美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博集团。
    泰国人民决心同全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族并肩战斗，沿着毛主席所指引的人民战争的道路奋勇前进！
