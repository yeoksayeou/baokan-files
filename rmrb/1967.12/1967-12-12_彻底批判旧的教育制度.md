	Thoroughly Criticize the Old Education System

	Chairman Mao says: Education must serve proletarian politics and be combined with productive labor. But from elementary school to high school, the education I received was all about advancing to the next level of schooling. The goal of advancing was not to better serve the people or contribute to production and construction, but to achieve personal fame and status, to be superior to others. In the sixth grade of elementary school, our homeroom teacher instructed us to aim for a "good" middle school. After getting into middle school, we had to strive to get into high school. Once in high school, we naturally thought we would go on to college.

	However, things did not go as planned. After graduating from high school, I became a worker. At first, my thoughts were in turmoil. When I decided to devote myself to labor and do a good job, I found that what I had learned from books did not apply to production, and I encountered obstacles everywhere. It was then that I deeply felt how harmful the revisionist educational line is!

	After Chairman Mao issued the great call for a proletarian educational revolution, revolutionary teachers, students, and workers, guided by the great thought of Mao Zedong, are vigorously criticizing the revisionist educational line. This revolution will surely achieve a thorough victory, and it will make the broad masses of young people in our country become the most politically conscious and hardworking new generation in the world.

　　彻底批判旧的教育制度
    毛主席说：教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合。但从小学到中学，学校向我灌输的却是升学、升学再升学。升学的目的，并不是为了更好地为人民服务，为生产建设服务，而是为了个人成名成家，高人一等。在小学六年级，班主任就叮嘱我们要考上一个“好”的中学。考上初中，又要为升高中而奋斗。一考上高中，便觉得自己将来当然要上大学了。
    但是，事与愿违，我高中毕业后，当了一名工人。开始思想动荡很大。当我安心从事劳动，想要把工作做得好些的时候，又发现自己过去从书本上学习的东西，和现在的生产挂不上钩，处处碰钉子。到这时我才深深感到修正主义教育路线是多么害人！
    毛主席发出了关于进行无产阶级教育革命的伟大号召以后，广大革命师生和革命工人，正以伟大的毛泽东思想为指南，大力批判修正主义教育路线。这场革命必将取得彻底胜利，它将使我国广大青少年，成为世界上最有政治觉悟、最热爱劳动的一代新人。
