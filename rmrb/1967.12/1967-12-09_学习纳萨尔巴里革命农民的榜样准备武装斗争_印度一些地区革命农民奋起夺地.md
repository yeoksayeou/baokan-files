	Revolutionary peasants in some regions of India are seizing land during the harvest season. They are learning from the example of the revolutionary peasants in the Nasalbari region, accumulating strength, and preparing to establish armed struggle zones.

	In the Barich district of Uttar Pradesh, revolutionary peasants have seized back several thousand acres of land and distributed it. Some panicked landlords have fled. Local peasants are organizing to launch a Nasalbari-style struggle. In the areas around and near Canning, south of Calcutta in West Bengal, peasants have organized to harvest and distribute rice. From the last week of October to November 21, such incidents have occurred about thirty times. Peasants have distributed about 1,500 maunds (approximately 110,000 jin) of rice.

	The reactionary government, in order to protect the interests of the landlord class, hastily established sixteen armed police camps around Canning to deal with the so-called "troubles during the harvest." They have already arrested more than forty peasants. However, even Indian reactionary newspapers, when reporting this incident, had to admit that the armed police's suppression "hardly has any effect."

    学习纳萨尔巴里革命农民的榜样准备武装斗争
    印度一些地区革命农民奋起夺地
    新华社讯　新德里消息：印度目前已进入收割季节。一些地区的革命农民正在趁收割的时机，奋起从地主手中夺取土地和庄稼，进行分配，并学习纳萨尔巴里地区革命农民榜样，积蓄力量，准备建立武装斗争地区。
    在北方邦巴腊伊奇县，革命农民夺回了几千英亩的土地，并且进行分配。一些惊慌失措的地主已经逃跑。当地农民正在组织起来，准备开展纳萨尔巴里式的斗争。西孟加拉邦加尔各答以南的坎宁镇周围和附近一些地区，农民组织起来收割和分配稻谷。从十月最后一周到十一月二十一日，这样的事件已经发生了大约三十起。农民分配了大约一千五百芒特（约合十一万市斤）的稻谷。
    反动政府为了维护地主阶级的利益，慌忙地在坎宁镇周围设立了十六个武装警察营地，来对付所谓“收获中的麻烦”，并且已经逮捕了四十多名农民。但是，连印度反动报纸在报道这一事件时也不得不承认，武装警察的镇压“几乎不起任何作用”。
