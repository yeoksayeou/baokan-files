On the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's congratulatory telegram to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, fully expresses the common wish of the 700 million people of the nation and is also a battle call issued to us, which has greatly educated and inspired us. We fully support it, and we will resolutely carry it out, word for word.

The great victories of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation have once again proven the correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion that "all reactionaries are paper tigers"! The U.S. imperialists are precisely a seemingly powerful paper tiger. The more troops they send to South Vietnam, the more disastrous their defeats. They have been beaten to a pulp by the heroic Vietnamese people and are at their wits' end. The great victories of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation have also further exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, which pretends to support but actually betrays. It has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and greatly dampened the spirits of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, setting a brilliant example for the oppressed peoples and nations of the world and pointing the direction for struggle. As Chairman Mao pointed out in the telegram: "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

The victory of the Vietnamese people is our victory and the victory of all revolutionary people of the world. We feel greatly inspired and immensely encouraged.

Our province of Yunnan is on the front line of supporting Vietnam against American aggression. Our province is connected with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north and south, and we are interdependent. The Kunming Railway Bureau is directly responsible for the honorable task of transporting supplies to support Vietnam against American aggression. The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres in our bureau have always followed the great teachings of Chairman Mao, regarding the transportation of supplies to support Vietnam against American aggression as our honorable internationalist duty. No matter the circumstances, we always prioritize the transportation of supplies to support Vietnam against American aggression.

Chairman Mao's telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho is a battle call issued to us. We will take Comrade Li Wenzhong, the model of supporting the left and loving the people, as our example: "If Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; if Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; if Chairman Mao instructs me, I carry it out; if Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance." We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call with actual actions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, "grasp revolution, promote production," and with unshakable confidence, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. With high spirits, we will firmly hold our production positions, and together with all revolutionary workers and cadres in the bureau, we will do our utmost and use every means to make the transportation of supplies to support Vietnam against American aggression even better, until we completely, thoroughly, and cleanly drive the American aggressors out of Vietnamese territory, until the Vietnamese people achieve complete and thorough victory in their war against American aggression and for national salvation!

    誓作英雄越南人民的坚强后盾
    昆明铁路局无产阶级革命派
    在越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的时候，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席的贺电，充分表达了全国七亿人民的共同心愿，也是向我们发出的战斗号召，使我们受到很大的教育和鼓舞。我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护，坚决照办，字字照办。
    越南人民抗美救国战争取得的伟大胜利，又一次证明了伟大领袖毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断是何等正确！美帝国主义正是一只貌似强大的纸老虎。它不断向南越增兵，但增兵越多，失败得越惨。它被英雄的越南人民打得落花流水，走投无路。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，也进一步暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团假支持、真出卖的叛徒嘴脸，大长了全世界革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风，给全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族树立了光辉的榜样，指出了斗争的方向。正如毛主席在贺电中指出的：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    越南人民的胜利，就是我们的胜利，也是全世界革命人民的胜利，我们感到非常振奋，无限鼓舞。
    我们云南省地处援越抗美的前哨，我省与越南民主共和国南北相连，唇齿相依。我们昆明铁路局，直接担负着运输援越抗美物资的光荣任务。我局广大无产阶级革命派、革命职工、革命干部，一贯遵循毛主席的伟大教导，把做好援越抗美的运输工作当作自己应尽的光荣的国际主义义务，不管在任何情况下，都把援越抗美的物资运输作为工作的重点。
    毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电，是对我们发出的战斗号召。我们要以“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志为榜样：“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”我们坚决用实际行动响应毛主席的伟大号召，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，“抓革命，促生产”，信心百倍地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，情绪饱满地坚守生产岗位，同全局革命职工和革命干部一道，尽最大努力，千方百计地把援越抗美的运输工作做得好上加好，直到把美国侵略者全部、干净、彻底地赶出越南国土，直到越南人民取得抗美救国战争的完全彻底的胜利！
