	Seriously Implementing Chairman Mao's Great Directive to "Ensure Grain is Tightly Controlled"
	Heilongjiang Province Exceeds State Grain Procurement Target for the Year
	Procurement Progress is Fast, Quality is High, and Stockpiled Grain Increased by 12 Percent Compared to the Bumper Harvest Year of 1966
	According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 20th — The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural people's communes of Heilongjiang Province, along with the workers of state farms, have actively sold grain to the state after achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. By December 15th, the province had exceeded the 1967 state grain procurement target by 0.9 percent. The procurement progress is fast, the stockpiled amount is large, and the quality is high. Compared to last year, this year's grain procurement progress is 40 days ahead of schedule, and the stockpiled grain is 12 percent more than the bumper harvest year of 1966. First and second-grade grain accounts for more than 80 percent of the total stockpiled amount. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and state farm workers excitedly said, "This is a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

	This year, the broad masses of peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural people's communes of Heilongjiang Province have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," carried forward the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and "daring to change the heavens and earth," and waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters such as wind, hail, drought, flood, pests, and frost. They achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output increased by more than 10 percent compared to the highest historical year of 1966. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, in the face of the bumper harvest, constantly remember Chairman Mao. They recall the bitter days of the old society, contrast them with today's happy life, and are all moved to say: "Chairman Mao, it is all thanks to your leadership. We must sell more grain, sell good grain, to bring you honor and add luster to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." During the grain procurement period, the entire province's rural areas extensively and deeply carried out education on the situation and class education. Many places, under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes from the commune to the production team. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, with "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key link and "the three articles" as their weapons, fiercely criticized "selfishness" and vigorously criticized revisionism, greatly raising their class consciousness. They said: "Every grain we sell more is equivalent to increasing our anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist strength."

	All levels of revolutionary committees in the province, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings to "trust and rely on the masses, trust and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and trust and rely on the majority of cadres," held three or four-level cadre meetings before grain procurement to ensure that the state's policies on grain procurement are directly communicated to the masses, turning the Party's policies into the conscious actions of the broad masses. The broad masses of rural commune members repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great strategic directive of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people" and his teachings on "balancing the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual," greatly enhancing their enthusiasm for selling grain to the state.

	Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously implementing Chairman Mao's great directive to "ensure grain is tightly controlled." After completing the state's grain procurement, they are determined to sell more surplus grain to support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

    据新华社哈尔滨二十日电　黑龙江省农村人民公社广大贫下中农社员和国营农场职工，在夺得今年农业生产的空前大丰收以后，积极向国家交售粮食。截至十二月十五日止，全省已超额百分之零点九完成了一九六七年度国家粮食征购任务。粮食征购进度快，入库量多，质量好。同去年比较，今年征购粮食的进度提前四十天，入库粮食比大丰收的一九六六年还增加百分之十二。一、二等粮占入库总量的百分之八十以上。广大贫下中农社员和国营农场职工兴奋地说，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    今年，黑龙江省农村人民公社广大社员和革命干部，认真贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，发扬“只争朝夕”和“敢教日月换新天”的革命精神，同风、雹、旱、涝、虫、霜等自然灾害展开了英勇顽强的斗争，夺得了空前未有的农业大丰收。粮食总产量比历史上最高的一九六六年还增产一成以上。广大贫下中农社员在丰收面前，念念不忘毛主席。他们回忆起在旧社会的悲惨日子，对照今天的幸福生活，无不激动地说：“毛主席啊，毛主席，都是您老人家领导得好。我们一定要多卖粮，卖好粮，为您老人家争光，为无产阶级文化大革命添彩。”在粮食征购期间，全省农村广泛深入地开展了形势教育和阶级教育。许多地方在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，从公社到生产队大办毛泽东思想学习班。广大贫下中农和革命干部，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老三篇”为武器，狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义，阶级觉悟大大提高。他们说：“我们多交一斤粮，就等于多增加一分反帝反修力量。”
    全省各级革命委员会遵照毛主席“要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，在征购粮食前都分别召开了三级或四级干部会议，使粮食征购的各项政策和群众直接见面，把党的方针政策变成了广大群众的自觉行动。广大农村社员反复学习了毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针和“必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益”的教导，向国家交售粮食的积极性大大提高。
    目前，黑龙江省农村广大贫下中农社员和革命干部，正在更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧”的伟大指示，在完成国家征购粮以后，决心再多售余粮，支援无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设。
