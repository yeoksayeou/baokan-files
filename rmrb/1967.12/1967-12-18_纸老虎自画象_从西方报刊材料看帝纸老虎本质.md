In the fiery battlefield of South Vietnam, American imperialism is like a scorched and exhausted wild cow, trapped in a desperate situation with no way out. It continuously increases its troops in South Vietnam, only to see American casualties escalate in response. Its new strategies and tactics, one after another, have met with failure. In the face of the heroic South Vietnamese people, the seemingly powerful American imperialism has fully exposed its hollow and weak nature.

Facing defeat in South Vietnam, the propaganda machines of the United States and the West have issued a chorus of lamentations. They cannot hide their inner panic and mourn the decline of American imperialism. The wails of the American propaganda machine have, in fact, painted a self-portrait of the American paper tiger.

Being Passively Beaten

The people of South Vietnam firmly grasp the initiative on the battlefield, widely waging a people's war, leading the American aggressors by the nose, and dragging them to exhaustion. This has caused the Western bourgeois propaganda machine to exclaim: The American aggressors in the South Vietnamese battlefield are "repeatedly forced to engage in combat at times and places chosen by the enemy (the South Vietnamese military and civilians)."

The British *Times* recently stated that in this stage, the South Vietnamese battlefield is still "controlled by the liberation armed forces," and "when and where to fight" is still "decided by the people's liberation armed forces." Even the American imperialist strategist, former President Kennedy's advisor, Schlesinger, had to admit that the American aggressors, who have a significant advantage in weapons and troop numbers, are "stuck" by the South Vietnamese military and civilians.

Since the beginning of the dry season this year, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces have taken advantage of their initiative to launch continuous attacks, maneuvering the American aggressors in motion, and inflicting heavy losses on them, achieving one victory after another. The American imperialist mouthpiece, the Associated Press, has repeatedly exclaimed: The U.S. military in South Vietnam is facing "ominous signs." The offensive of the liberation armed forces is "more extensive than any previous period in this war," and the liberation armed forces not only "can still seize the initiative" but also "coordinate military operations" across the entire South Vietnamese battlefield, making the American aggressors struggle and exhaust their forces.

Now, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces are launching fierce attacks on the American aggressors on all fronts. American reactionary newspapers are worried and lament, "Nearly 500,000 American troops can hardly hold their positions."

Heart-Pounding Fear

The people of South Vietnam, united in their hatred of the enemy, fight in every village and every person, spreading a people's war net across the entire South Vietnamese battlefield, making the American aggressors tremble with fear every day, worrying about being annihilated at any moment.

*U.S. News & World Report* admits that in the vast sea of people's war, there is no place in South Vietnam that is "safe" for them. It marvels that "there is no place in South Vietnam" that is beyond the reach of the sudden and devastating attacks or mortar shelling of the liberation armed forces. "No matter where, there is no front line, and there is no safe rear area—this is a fact that the U.S. military will never forget."

An American artilleryman, terrified, said that in South Vietnam, there is "no place" where the American aggressors can sit down for a moment, knowing that the liberation armed forces "will not throw something into your collar." Even a bandit leader like the former commander of the U.S. Marines in Vietnam, Walter, had to admit before leaving South Vietnam that he could not deal with the guerrilla warfare of the South Vietnamese people, making him "feel discouraged."

"The Advantage" is Gone

The heroic people of North Vietnam have also defeated American imperialism's "air superiority" with people's war. So far, more than 2,600 American aggressor planes have been shot down, many of which were shot down by militiamen using rifles and machine guns, and many American air pirates were captured by militiamen with bayonets. *U.S. News & World Report* exclaimed that the anti-aircraft fire network composed of various weapons by the North Vietnamese military and civilians is "the most advanced and concentrated defensive force that the U.S. Air Force has ever encountered," and the ground fire is "very fierce." For American jet pilots, invading the airspace of North Vietnam is "changing from merely dangerous to fatal."

An old pilot, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Peter Flynn, who had flown for 23 years, was shot down and captured on his first raid on Hanoi. After being captured, he admitted that because the North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire was fierce, he was "heart-pounding and sweating" when he invaded with his plane. He said that because many American air pirates were killed in raids on North Vietnam, the morale of the U.S. Air Force was very low. In some air bases, there was a "depressed atmosphere."

The true face of this American paper tiger has been thoroughly exposed by the Vietnamese people. However, it will never change its nature of aggression. Now, American imperialism is escalating the war while playing tricks with "peace talks." However, no matter how desperately it struggles, its fate of complete failure is sealed in front of the heroic Vietnamese people.

Failure and Despair

According to the Associated Press, the apologist for American monopoly capital, columnist Lipmann, recently said with a "melancholy and pessimistic" heart that the United States is experiencing the worst period in its 77-year history due to the failure of the American imperialist aggression in Vietnam. On the one hand, he sympathizes with the American leader Johnson being "in a mess" by the Vietnam War, and on the other hand, he complains that Johnson has "messed up" the United States. What hurts Lipmann the most is that due to the failure of the Vietnam War, the "hope, faith, and will" of American imperialism to permanently occupy South Vietnam have all collapsed or dispersed.

The American propaganda machine and reactionary politicians are increasingly lamenting the deep mire of the United States in the South Vietnamese battlefield, despairingly sighing that the situation of American imperialism has "never been as disheartening as it is now." The core figures of American imperialism, the Democratic leader of the U.S. Senate, Mansfield, lamented that due to the failure of the Vietnam War, it has created "the most serious and complex situation for the United States since World War II." It is this situation that has caused internal mutual blame, mutual attacks, and endless quarrels within the American ruling class. It is this situation that has forced Johnson to dismiss his defense secretary, McNamara, who had served him loyally, as a scapegoat. The *International Herald Tribune* pointed out that McNamara's dismissal shows that "the most confident person is losing confidence in the war."

The lamentations of the American propaganda machine and reactionary politicians fully expose the weakness of American imperialism, while the truly powerful are the heroic Vietnamese military and civilians.

	The so-called "elite troops" are actually tofu soldiers.
	The silver-plated gunhead shows its true form when struck.
	The wounded are wounded, and the dead are dead.
	Bodies are scattered everywhere, and casualties are countless.
	At the sound of gunfire, they tremble with fear.
	They bury their heads like the woodpecker, praying to God for help.
	They are trapped in a desperate situation in Vietnam, and failure is inevitable.
	They have a mournful face, and the star of disaster is distressed.
	The air pirates show their ferocity, but the artillery welcomes them.
	Some are annihilated, and some are captured alive.

### 纸老虎自画象  从西方报刊材料看帝纸老虎本质

　　纸老虎自画象
    从西方报刊材料看帝纸老虎本质
    在越南南方人民战争的火海中，美帝国主义象一头烧得焦头烂额的野牛，陷进了走投无路的绝境。它不断增兵南越，结果使美军伤亡随之“升级”；它绞尽脑汁想出的新战略战术，一个接着一个破产。在英雄的越南南方人民面前，貌似强大的美帝国主义，完全暴露了它的外强中干的本质。
    面对在南越的惨败，美国和西方的宣传机器发出了一片悲鸣。他们掩不住内心的惊慌，哀叹着美帝国主义的衰败。美国宣传机器的悲鸣，正好构成了美国纸老虎的自画象。
　　被动挨打
    越南南方人民牢牢掌握战场主动权，广泛开展人民战争，牵着美国侵略军的鼻子走，把它们拖得精疲力竭，打得焦头烂额。这使得西方资产阶级的宣传机器惊呼：美国侵略军在南越战场上“一再被迫在敌人（南方军民）所选择的时间和地点投入战斗”。
    英国《泰晤士报》最近说，在这个阶段，南越战场上“掌握主动权”的仍然是解放武装力量，“何时何处打”仍然由人民解放武装力量“来选择”。连美帝国主义的智囊人物、当过前总统肯尼迪的顾问的施勒辛格也不得不承认，“武器和军队人数都占着很大优势”的美国侵略军被南方军民“打得动弹不得”。
    今年旱季开始以来，南方人民解放武装力量发挥主动进攻的优势，连续出击，在运动中调动美国侵略军，并予以大量的歼灭，接连取得了巨大胜利。对此，美帝国主义的喉舌美联社更是接连惊呼：美军在南越战场上面临“不祥之兆”。人民解放武装力量的攻势“规模比这场战争中以前的任何时期都要广泛”，解放武装力量不仅“仍然能够夺取主动”，而且在整个南越战场范围内“统筹军事行动”，把美国侵略军打得捉襟见肘，“兵力陷于枯竭”。
    现在，南方人民解放武装力量正在各条战线上，接连向美国侵略军发动猛烈的进攻。美国反动报刊忧心忡忡地哀叹，“接近五十万人的美国军队，几乎守不住自己的阵地”。
　　心惊肉跳
    南越人民同仇敌忾，村自为战，人自为战，在整个南越战场上布下了人民战争的天罗地网，使美国侵略军终日心惊肉跳，担心随时会遭到被歼灭的命运。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》承认，在人民战争的汪洋大海中，南越没有一块地方对他们说来是“安全”的。它惊叹
  “南越没有任何地方”是解放武装力量的“突然的毁灭性袭击或迫击炮袭击所打不到的”，“无论在哪里，既没有前线，也没有安全的后方地区——这是美军所永远难忘的事实。”
    一个美国炮兵惶恐地说，在南越“没有任何地方”能够让美国侵略军坐下一会儿，而知道解放武装力量“不会在你领口里掷点什么”。象前侵越美国海军陆战队司令沃尔特那样的强盗头子，在滚出南越之前，也不得不公开承认他对付不了越南南方人民的游击战，因而使他“感到沮丧”。
　　“优势”休矣
    英雄的越南北方军民也用人民战争打败了美帝国主义的“空中优势”。到现在为止，已打下美国强盗飞机两千六百多架，其中许多飞机是被民兵用步枪和机枪打下来的，许多美国飞贼是在民兵的刺刀下束手就擒的。《美国新闻与世界报道》惊呼越南北方军民用各种武器组成的防空火力网是“美国空军历来遇到过的最新式和最集中的防御力量”，地面火力“非常猛烈”，“对美国喷气机驾驶员来说”，侵入越南北方上空，“正在从仅仅是危险的，转变为致命的”。
    一个驾驶飞机已二十三年的老牌飞贼、美国空军上校约翰·彼得·弗林第一次袭击河内，就被打下活捉了。他在被俘后供认，因为越南北方防空火力厉害，他驾机侵入时就“怕得心脏怦怦地跳，并且（身上）冒出汗来。”他说，由于袭击越南北方的美国飞贼大批丧命，所以美国空军的士气非常低落。在一些空军基地里“笼罩着沉闷的气氛”。
    美帝国主义这只纸老虎的原形被越南人民彻底捅破了。但是它永远也不会改变侵略本性。现在美帝国主义正在加紧战争“升级”，同时玩弄“和谈”阴谋。然而不管它怎样疯狂挣扎，在英雄的越南人民面前，它的彻底失败的命运是注定了的。失败沮丧
    据美联社报道，美国垄断资本的辩护士、专栏作家李普曼由于美帝侵越战争失败，最近“怀着忧郁和悲观”的心情说，美国正在经历它七十七年生活中最糟糕的时期。他一面对美帝头子约翰逊被侵越战争“弄得不可开交”表示同情，一面又抱怨约翰逊把美国“搞得一团糟”。最使李普曼伤心的是，由于侵越战争的失败，使得美帝国主义妄图永久霸占南越的“希望、信仰和意志全都垮台或涣散了”。
    美国的宣传机器和反动政客正在越来越多地为美国在南越战场上的深陷泥潭而悲鸣，灰心丧气地哀叹美帝国主义的处境“从来没有象现在那样令人沮丧”。美帝国主义的核心人物、美国参议院民主党头子曼斯菲尔德哀叹，由于侵越战争失败，造成了“自从第二次世界大战以来美国最严重而复杂的局势”。正是这种局势，使得美国统治集团内部互相埋怨，互相攻击，吵闹不休。正是这种局势，使得约翰逊不得不把曾经为他效尽犬马之劳的国防部长麦克纳马拉当作替罪羊而撤了职。美国《国际先驱论坛报》指出，麦克纳马拉的下台表明，“这个最最自信的人正在对战争失去信心。”
    美国宣传机器和反动政客的这些悲鸣，充分暴露了美帝国主义的虚弱本质，而真正强大的是英雄的越南军民。

　　所谓“王牌军”  其实豆腐兵
　　银样镴枪头　一打现原形
　　受伤的受伤　送命的送命
　　遗尸到处是　伤亡算不清
　　一闻枪炮声　胆战又心惊
　　埋头学舵鸟　求上帝救命
　　侵越陷绝境　失败已注定
　　一副哭丧脸　愁煞了灾星
　　飞贼把凶逞　炮火来相迎
　　有的被消灭　有的被活擒
