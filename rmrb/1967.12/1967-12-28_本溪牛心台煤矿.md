Edition: 4

The revolutionary workers of Benxi Mining Bureau's Niu Xintai Coal Mine, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine, have conscientiously implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." On the basis of completing the state plan for eleven consecutive months, they have completed this year's annual state production plan for raw coal twenty-one days ahead of schedule. The labor productivity of the entire workforce has reached a historical high, an increase of 2.4 percent over last year. Wood consumption in the mine has also been reduced compared to previous years.

With revolution in their hearts, there is enthusiasm in their work. The broad masses of workers voluntarily observe proletarian discipline and have established a new revolutionary order. They persist in carrying out the revolution above ground and promoting production below ground, in carrying out the revolution in their spare time, in promoting revolution through thrift, and in adhering to the eight-hour workday, using the time outside of the eight-hour workday to carry out the cultural revolution. Many workers have displayed a spirit of fearlessness and continuous struggle, refusing to leave their posts until their tasks are completed. In the working faces, one can always hear the songs and recitations of "Down with determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory."

    本溪牛心台煤矿
    本溪矿务局牛心台煤矿广大革命职工，在驻矿人民解放军的大力帮助下，不折不扣地认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在连续十一个月完成国家计划的基础上，提前二十一天完成了今年全年的国家原煤生产计划。全员效率创造了历史最高水平，比去年提高百分之二点四。坑木消耗也比往年低。
    心中有了革命，工作就有了干劲。广大职工自觉地遵守无产阶级的纪律，建立起革命的新秩序。他们一直坚持上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产，坚持业余闹革命，节约闹革命，坚持八小时工作制，在八小时工作以外的时间搞文化革命。许多工人发扬不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，不完成任务不肯离开生产岗位。在工作面里，随时可以听到“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的歌声和朗读声。
