The U.S. aggression in Vietnam has reached a dead end, facing internal and external difficulties, struggling in desperation. The butcher of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, McNamara, steps down.

	BEIJING, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) — WASHINGTON — In the face of the U.S. imperialism's war in Vietnam reaching a dead end and the intensification of disputes within the ruling clique, U.S. President Johnson announced on November 29 the removal of Defense Secretary McNamara. This marks the further failure of U.S. imperialism's policy in Vietnam.

	McNamara has served as the Defense Secretary for the U.S. imperialism's aggressive and war policies for nearly seven years. This war monger, during his tenure, visited South Vietnam nine times, exhausting his brains and energy for the U.S. war in Vietnam. However, due to the increasingly disastrous failure of the war in Vietnam, it became unmanageable, ultimately leading to his own downfall from the "throne" of Defense Secretary. For years, the Johnson administration, in the war in Vietnam, has relentlessly pursued a counter-revolutionary strategy of "war and peace," employing tactics such as "special warfare," "limited warfare," "pacification plans," "dry season offensives," "bombing to force negotiations," and "stopping bombing to lure negotiations." However, in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people, all these counter-revolutionary tricks have failed. The Vietnamese military and people are fighting stronger and stronger, and the U.S. imperialism cannot win the war or deceive anyone, facing the prospect of annihilation.

	With the disastrous defeat on the battlefield in Vietnam, disputes within the U.S. ruling clique over how to salvage the failed Vietnam policy have intensified. The domestic anti-war movement is growing, and Johnson, facing the upcoming election, is having a harder time. Recently, Johnson's black meeting at the White House on the Vietnam war also failed to find a magical solution to get out of the Vietnam war deadlock. According to Western bourgeois news agencies, McNamara's resignation is a "mid-course horse change" measure that Johnson had to take to try to salvage the failed Vietnam policy and deal with the election.

	McNamara's resignation does not mean that U.S. imperialism will change its aggressive and war policies, but rather it is a sign of the Johnson administration's desperate struggle in the Vietnam quagmire. In his statement on November 29, Johnson bluntly declared that the U.S. policy in Vietnam "is firmly decided." Western bourgeois news agencies even pointed out that McNamara's resignation "may mean that the current U.S. policy towards Vietnam will become even more hardline, and military actions will be intensified."

	No matter what kind of "horse" the U.S. imperialism changes, no matter how much it escalates the war in Vietnam, under the fierce blows of the heroic Vietnamese people, its complete failure is inevitable. The higher the U.S. imperialism escalates the war in Vietnam, the more disastrous its failure will be.

    侵越战争穷途末路　内外交困日子难过　中途换马垂死挣扎
    美帝侵越刽子手麦克纳马拉下台
    新华社三十日讯　华盛顿消息：在美帝国主义的侵越战争走投无路，统治集团内部的争吵空前激化的情况下，美帝头子约翰逊二十九日宣布撤掉国防部长麦克纳马拉的职务，这标志着美帝国主义的侵越政策的进一步破产。
    麦克纳马拉担任美帝国主义推行侵略和战争政策的国防部长将近七年。这个战争贩子在任职期间曾九赴南越，为美帝侵越战争绞尽了脑汁，卖尽了力气，可是由于侵越战争越败越惨，不可收拾，最后连他自己也从国防部长的“宝座”上倒栽了下来。多年来，约翰逊政府在侵越战争中变本加厉地推行反革命战“和”两手策略，什么“特种战争”、“局部战争”，什么“绥靖计划”、“旱季攻势”，什么“以炸迫和”、“停炸诱和”，无所不用其极。但是，在英雄的越南人民面前，美帝这些反革命伎俩统统破了产。越南军民越战越强，美帝国主义打不赢、骗不成，面临覆灭的绝境。
    随着侵越战场上的惨败，美国统治集团内部在如何挽救侵越败局的问题上发生了空前激烈的争吵，国内人民反对侵越战争的运动日益高涨，面临大选的约翰逊日子越来越不好过。最近约翰逊在白宫召开的侵越战争黑会，也丝毫找不到走出侵越战争死胡同的灵丹妙药。据西方资产阶级通讯社透露，麦克纳马拉的下台，是约翰逊妄图挽救侵越败局和应付大选不得不采取的“中途换马”的措施。
    麦克纳马拉的下台绝不意味着美帝国主义会改变它的侵略和战争政策，而是约翰逊政府在侵越泥潭中垂死挣扎的表现。约翰逊在二十九日的声明中就露骨地叫嚷，美国的侵越政策“是坚决确定了的”。西方资产阶级通讯社甚至指出，麦克纳马拉的下台“可能意味着现在美国对越南的政策将更加强硬，军事行动将要加紧进行”。
    不管美帝国主义换什么样的“马”，不管它把侵越战争升到哪一级，在英雄的越南人民的勇猛打击下，它的彻底失败的命运是注定了的。美帝的侵越战争升级越高，失败也就越惨。
