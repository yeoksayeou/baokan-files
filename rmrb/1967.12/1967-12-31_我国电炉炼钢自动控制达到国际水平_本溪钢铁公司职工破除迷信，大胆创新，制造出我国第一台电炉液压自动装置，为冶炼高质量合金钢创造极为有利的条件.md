In the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories nationwide, the revolutionary workers of Benxi Steel Company have brought good news to the people of the whole country: China's first electric furnace hydraulic automatic device has been successfully developed in the struggle between the two lines. This is a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The birth of the electric furnace hydraulic automatic device marks that China's electric furnace steelmaking automation has reached an internationally advanced level. It has created extremely favorable conditions for China to smelt high-quality alloy steel quickly, efficiently, and at a low cost, and laid a good foundation for the high automation of electric furnace steelmaking in China.

In the past, China's electric furnace steelmaking has been using electric motors and mechanical devices for automatic control. Its operation sensitivity is low, the steelmaking time is long, the power consumption is high, and the cost is high. The hydraulic automatic device that has been successfully developed has high operation sensitivity, short steelmaking time, low power consumption, low cost, and is easy to maintain. Currently, only a few countries in the world have mastered this technology.

Since China's first electric furnace hydraulic automatic device was officially put into production on December 13, it has been running normally and has already produced dozens of furnaces of alloy steel, with a steel qualification rate of 100%.

The development of the electric furnace hydraulic automatic device has gone through a fierce struggle between the two lines. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and Benxi Steel have always opposed Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line and have been pushing a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the enterprise. They have been superstitious about foreign frameworks and bourgeois "authorities," opposing revolutionary mass movements. In scientific and technological work, they have been thoroughgoing slaves and crawlers, doing everything they can to obstruct revolutionary workers from experimenting with new technologies. After a year of tempering and testing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers, cadres, and engineering and technical personnel, with the firm support and help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, criticized the revisionist line of managing enterprises pushed by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and criticized the reactionary technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. Revolutionary workers actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, studying Chairman Mao's teachings over and over again: "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will certainly catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." "We cannot follow the old path of technological development of all countries in the world, crawling step by step behind others. We must break the conventions and adopt advanced technology as much as possible, and in a not-too-long historical period, build our country into a socialist modernized powerful country." Chairman Mao's teachings have given the revolutionary workers boundless strength and wisdom. In the process of development, revolutionary workers follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force of world history," and follow the mass line. Inside the factory, they implement the combination of revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary technical personnel, and outside the factory, they implement the combination of scientific research, production, and design units. With collective wisdom, they quickly overcame numerous difficulties and successfully developed China's first electric furnace hydraulic automatic device in just one and a half months. This speed is two years faster than the time it took capitalist countries to develop similar equipment, and the investment is 90% less. Revolutionary workers of Benxi Steel deeply feel: Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, any miracle in the world can be created.

    我国电炉炼钢自动控制达到国际水平
    本溪钢铁公司职工破除迷信，大胆创新，制造出我国第一台电炉液压自动装置，为冶炼高质量合金钢创造极为有利的条件
    据新华社沈阳三十日电　在全国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，本溪钢铁公司的广大革命职工给全国人民送来了喜讯：我国第一台电炉液压自动装置在两条路线搏斗中试制成功了。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    电炉液压自动装置的诞生，标志着我国电炉炼钢的自动控制达到了国际先进水平。它为我国多快好省地冶炼高质量的合金钢创造了极为有利的条件，为我国电炉炼钢高度自动化打下了良好的基础。
    过去，我国电炉炼钢一直是采用电动机和机械装置进行自动控制。它的操作灵敏度低，炼钢时间长，消耗电力大，成本高。试制成功的这种液压自动装置，操作灵敏度高，炼钢时间短，电力消耗少，成本低，而且便于维护。目前世界上仅有少数国家掌握这种技术。
    我国第一台电炉液压自动装置自十二月十三日正式投入生产以来，运转正常，已经炼出了几十炉合金钢，钢的合格率达到百分之百。
    电炉液压自动装置的试制，贯穿着两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在冶金工业部和本钢的代理人，一贯对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在企业里推行反革命修正主义路线。他们迷信洋框框，迷信资产阶级“权威”，反对革命的群众运动。他们在科学技术工作中搞的是彻头彻尾的奴隶主义、爬行主义，千方百计地阻拦广大革命职工试验新技术，经过一年来无产阶级文化大革命锻炼和考验的广大革命工人、革命干部和工程技术人员，在驻厂人民解放军的坚决支持和帮助下，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的修正主义的办企业路线，批判了资产阶级反动技术“权威”。革命职工活学活用毛主席著作，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的教导：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”“我们不能走世界各国技术发展的老路，跟在别人后面一步一步地爬行。我们必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术，在一个不太长的历史时期内，把我国建设成为一个社会主义的现代化的强国。”毛主席的教导，给革命职工增添了无穷的力量和智慧。试制过程中，革命职工遵照毛主席“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”这一教导，走群众路线，在厂内实行革命工人、革命干部和革命技术人员三结合，在厂外实行科学研究、生产和设计单位三结合，群策群力，迅速克服了重重困难，在一个半月内就成功地制出了我国第一台电炉液压自动装置。这种速度，比资本主义国家试制同样设备的时间缩短了两年，投资比它们减少百分之九十。本钢的革命职工深有体会地说：大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，什么样的人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
