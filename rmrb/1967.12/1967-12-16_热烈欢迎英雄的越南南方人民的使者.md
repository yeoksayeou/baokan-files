The heroic people of South Vietnam's delegation, amidst the frequent victories of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation, arrived in Beijing this afternoon by special plane. The delegation was invited by the China-Vietnam Friendship Association to participate in the activities commemorating the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and to conduct visits and inspections.

The leader of the South Vietnam People's Delegation is Nguyen Xuan Long, Vice Chairman of the South Vietnam Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, and the deputy leaders are Le Thi Chi and Sam Luc. The delegation includes representatives from trade unions, youth, and women's organizations. They have once again brought the fraternal fighting friendship of the 14 million people of South Vietnam to the people of our country from the front lines of the anti-American war.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Liu Ningyi, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army of China, as well as more than 2,000 people from the capital's militia, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses, went to the airport to warmly welcome the South Vietnamese comrades.

Today, the atmosphere at the capital's airport was filled with the brotherly friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam. The welcoming crowd held up portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of the great leader of the Vietnamese people and the close comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and portraits of the Chairman of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho. They shouted battle slogans, welcoming the arrival of the South Vietnamese comrades. The welcoming crowd also held up many banners with the following slogans: "Salute to the heroic people of South Vietnam!" "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation!" "Vietnam will win, the U.S. imperialists will be defeated!" "Long live the brotherly friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!"

After the South Vietnamese comrades disembarked from the plane amidst the sound of drums, a group of Red Guards presented them with the Red Book of the world's revolutionary people, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and read aloud Chairman Mao's teachings: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will certainly deliver a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation is a powerful proof of this."

The South Vietnamese comrades, accompanied by Comrades Chen Yi and Liu Ningyi, circled the airport to meet with the welcoming crowd. The welcoming crowd, filled with proletarian internationalist revolutionary friendship, held up the bright red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," waved the flags of China and Vietnam and the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and shouted slogans: "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great leader of the Vietnamese people and the close comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh!"

Those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation also included Wang Xinting, Qiao Guanhua, Ding Xilin, Niu Lianbi, and other relevant responsible officials. Nguyen Van Khoa, Head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, and Nguyen Minh Phuong, Deputy Head, as well as Ly Thong Thi, Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing, also went to the airport to welcome the delegation.
