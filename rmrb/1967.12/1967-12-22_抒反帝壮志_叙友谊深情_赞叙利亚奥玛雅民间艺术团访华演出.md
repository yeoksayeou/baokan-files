In the midst of the resounding victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the friendly envoys of the Syrian people—the Al-Mayadeen Folk Art Troupe—have arrived in our capital, Beijing. With their splendid performances, they have expressed their boundless love for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and their deep affection for the Chinese people. They have also praised the indomitable spirit of the brave Arab people who fearlessly fight against the aggression of imperialist bandits. We warmly congratulate the Al-Mayadeen Folk Art Troupe on their successful debut performance in China. We are confident that through this visit and performance, the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Syria will be further strengthened, and cultural and artistic exchanges between the two countries will be promoted.

In the face of the aggressive wars of imperialist bandits, what path should one choose? The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, says: "All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! All the peoples of the world, be courageous and dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and go forward wave upon wave. Then, the whole world will definitely be the world of the people. All the devils will be thoroughly annihilated." The brave Arab people have chosen the path of daring to struggle and daring to win.

In the second part of the performance, the troupe's members used various artistic forms such as group dances, solo dances, solos, and choral singing to depict the lives of the Syrian rural people and their heroic struggle against imperialism and colonialism.

Imperialism, especially American imperialism, is the common enemy of the people of the world. The armed aggression of imperialism has brought deep suffering to the Arab people. The brave Arab people, harboring deep hatred for the aggressors, have taken up arms and rushed to the battlefield to engage in a head-on struggle with American imperialism and its lackeys. Listen to their heroic battle songs:

	With tooth for tooth, with war to end war,
	The bugle calls, the war drums beat;
	The sword glistens, the blood of the free boils!

In "Nostalgia for the Homeland," the deep and powerful singing showcases the magnificent scene of the Arab people's heroic anti-imperialist struggle: "...Imperialism has destroyed our homes, and the savage war of aggression has forced us to leave our homeland. The fire of hatred burns everywhere, and the voices of the workers and peasants echo through the clouds. The songs of old have turned into thunderous roars!"

Yes, the Arab people are a heroic and unyielding people. From their magnificent battle songs and the stirring anti-imperialist war drums, we see the high morale and firm determination of the Arab people. Victory will surely belong to the heroic Arab people!

Songs and dances express deep feelings. The Syrian friends also enthusiastically performed exquisite Chinese songs and dances, which resonated deeply with us. When the troupe's members held up the portrait of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and the radiant Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and sang "The Core Force Leading Our Cause" and "On the Heights of Beijing" with all their hearts, the theater erupted in wave after wave of enthusiastic applause. When the performers sang and danced "Long Live Chairman Mao" in front of the radiant portrait of Chairman Mao, the theater instantly boiled over! The rhythmic applause from the audience echoed the beautiful dance steps and passionate singing on stage, blending the audience and the performers into one, immersing the peoples of China and Syria in the ocean of friendship and love for the great leader, Chairman Mao.

These Chinese songs and dances were performed by the Al-Mayadeen Art Troupe in a very short time. Why were they able to perform so successfully in such a short time? A performer from the Al-Mayadeen Art Troupe said: "When we saw Chairman Mao with the masses in Chinese documentary films at home, we were all moved to tears!" Another performer wore all five Chairman Mao badges he had received since coming to China on his chest during the performance. He said: "I feel that I perform well because I wear Chairman Mao's badge on my chest, Chairman Mao is in my heart, and I am full of strength!" The troupe's friends, upon arriving in China, learned their first words: "Long live Chairman Mao! Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" These sincere words from their hearts fully express their love for Chairman Mao and the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Currently, the struggle of the Syrian Arab people against the American and Israeli aggressors continues. We are confident that the brave Arab people will definitely defeat the American and Israeli aggressors! The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought firmly support the struggle of the Arab people. The final victory will surely belong to the brave Arab people!

    抒反帝壮志　叙友谊深情
    ——赞叙利亚奥玛雅民间艺术团访华演出
    东方歌舞团　文红兵
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中，阿拉伯叙利亚人民的友谊使者——奥玛雅民间艺术团的朋友们，来到了我国的首都——北京。他们以精采的艺术表演，抒发了对世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和对中国人民的深厚友情，歌颂了英勇的阿拉伯人民在帝国主义侵略强盗面前不畏强暴、英勇战斗的顽强精神。我们热烈地祝贺奥玛雅民间艺术团首次访华演出成功。我们深信，通过这次访问演出，将会进一步增进中叙两国人民的战斗友谊，促进两国文化艺术交流。
    在帝国主义强盗的侵略战争面前，究竟应该选择什么道路？世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”英勇的阿拉伯人民，正是选择了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的道路。
    在演出第二部分的一组大型歌舞节目中，艺术团的朋友们，用群舞、独舞、独唱、伴唱等丰富多样的艺术形式，刻划了叙利亚农村人民的生活以及他们反帝反殖的英勇斗争。
    帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义，是世界人民的共同死敌。帝国主义的武装侵略，给阿拉伯人民带来了深重的苦难。英勇的阿拉伯人民，怀着对侵略者的深仇大恨，拿起枪杆，奔赴战场，与美帝国主义及其走狗展开了针锋相对的斗争。请听他们豪迈的战斗的歌声：
        以牙还牙，以战争消灭战争，
        号角在响，战鼓在擂；
        宝剑闪耀，自由者的热血在沸腾！
    在《忆乡曲》中，沉郁雄劲的歌声展示了阿拉伯人民英勇反帝的壮丽图景：“……帝国主义毁坏了我们的家园，野蛮的侵略战争使我们离乡背井。仇恨的烈火在遍地燃烧，工农大众的呼声响彻云霄，昔日的歌变成了雷鸣般的吼声！”
    是的，阿拉伯人民是英雄的人民，不屈的人民。从那雄壮的战斗歌声里，从那激越的反帝战鼓声中，我们看到了阿拉伯人民高昂的斗志，坚定的信心。胜利一定属于英雄的阿拉伯人民！
    歌舞寄深情。叙利亚的朋友们，还热情洋溢地演出了精采的中国歌舞节目，激起了我们强烈的共鸣。当艺术团的朋友们手捧着世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席像和红光闪闪的宝书《毛主席语录》，放声歌唱《领导我们事业的核心力量》和《在北京的金山上》等歌曲时，剧场里响起了一阵又一阵热烈的掌声。当演员们在光芒四射的毛主席像前边唱边舞《万岁！毛主席》时，剧场顿时沸腾起来！台下有节奏的掌声，应和着台上优美的舞步和热情的歌声，台上台下融为一体，中叙两国人民沉浸在热爱伟大领袖毛主席的友谊的海洋里了。
    这些中国歌舞节目，是奥玛雅艺术团的朋友们在很短的时间里排演出来的。时间这么短，为什么他们却能演得这样成功呢？奥玛雅艺术团一位演员说：“我们在国内看到中国纪录电影中毛主席和群众在一起时，我们都感动得哭了！”还有一位演员在演出时，把来到中国后得到的五枚毛主席像章，通通挂在胸前。他说：“我感到所以演得好，是因为毛主席像章戴在胸前，毛主席在我心里，我浑身都有力量！”艺术团的朋友来到中国后，学会的第一句话就是：“毛主席万岁！祝毛主席万寿无疆！”这些发自他们内心的真挚的话语，充分表达了他们热爱毛主席，热爱用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民的心意。
    目前，阿拉伯叙利亚人民反抗美、以侵略者的斗争还在继续。我们深信，英勇的阿拉伯人民一定能战胜美、以侵略者！用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚决支持阿拉伯人民的斗争，最后胜利一定属于英勇的阿拉伯人民！（附图片）
