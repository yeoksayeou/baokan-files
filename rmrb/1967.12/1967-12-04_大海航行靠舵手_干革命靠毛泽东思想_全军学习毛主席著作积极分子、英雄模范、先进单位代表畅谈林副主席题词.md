The representatives of active learners of Chairman Mao's works, heroes, and model units from the entire army, upon hearing the joyous news of Comrade Lin Biao's inscription for the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Navy, were filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. They shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and wished Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years! Everyone discussed the great significance of Comrade Lin Biao's inscription and expressed their greatest resolve: "Though thousands of mountains and rivers separate us from Beijing, we will never leave Chairman Mao's side!"

		Forever Following the Great Helmsman Chairman Mao, Advancing Victoriously Through Stormy Seas

		Comrade Qiu GuoXian, Platoon Leader of the "Model Red Ninth Company" for Studying Chairman Mao's Works:

		Comrade Lin Biao's inscription, "Navigating the sea requires a helmsman, revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought," most concisely expresses our revolutionary soldiers' boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

		Our company was established by the great leader Chairman Mao on Jinggang Mountain forty years ago. For decades, we have followed Chairman Mao in revolutionary struggles. We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution. Chairman Mao was, is, and will forever be our supreme commander. Our red hearts will always be with the red sun. Comrade Li WenZhong, a model for supporting the left and serving the people, said before his death: "I don't believe in heaven, I don't believe in earth, I believe only in Chairman Mao." This sums up our feelings. To be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, we must "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao." Our company responds to Comrade Lin Biao's call, insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds. The ideological revolutionization of our company is increasingly strengthened, and batch after batch of red successors are growing up. In the future, we will forever and ever study and apply Chairman Mao's works, continuously achieve ideological revolutionization, and forever and ever follow the great commander Chairman Mao to victory!

		Comrades Yang XiaoZhong, Company Commander, and Pang ChaoSheng, Platoon Leader, of the company where the late model for supporting the left and serving the people, Comrade Li WenZhong, served:

		"The sea requires a helmsman, revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought." This is an absolute truth. Comrade Li WenZhong grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. He loved Chairman Mao the most and listened to Chairman Mao's words the most. He said: "Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao praises me, I praise Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao instructs me, I act accordingly." These four sentences are the crystallization of his experience in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in revolutionary practice, filled with revolutionary soldiers' boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He engraved these four sentences in his mind and put them into action. Therefore, in critical moments, he could stand up and bravely rescue the Red Guards. Learning from Comrade Lin Biao's inscription, we must be like Comrade Li WenZhong, unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, truly and forever doing what Chairman Mao says!

		Comrade Huang ZuShi, Political Instructor and Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works in the Entire Army:

		Comrade Lin Biao's inscription expresses our revolutionary soldiers' greatest wish, making me excited with boiling blood, summing up all my words in one sentence: Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years! Wish Comrade Lin Biao good health! Forever healthy!

		"The sea requires a helmsman, revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought." Following Chairman Mao and advancing in the direction he points out is victory! Our unit, following Chairman Mao's instruction, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left," firmly supports the left. In supporting the left, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party are terrified and threaten and attack us. At this time, we repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Thorough materialists are fearless," "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," as if Chairman Mao were by our side, commanding us to bravely fight. Everyone is fearless of hardship and fatigue, deeply entering factories and schools to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The great power of Mao Zedong Thought makes revolutionary masses' organizations level the "mountains," eliminate estrangement, achieve great unity, thoroughly isolate a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and achieve new victories in revolution and production.

		We revolutionary soldiers unconditionally love Chairman Mao, step by step follow Chairman Mao, and never leave Chairman Mao's side. We will forever and ever follow the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, break waves and forge ahead!

		Comrade Liu ChengKe, Platoon Leader of the platoon where the late Comrade Wang Jie served:

		Comrade Lin Biao's inscription speaks to our hearts. We will resolutely and forever act according to it!

		Acting according to Comrade Lin Biao's inscription, the most fundamental thing is to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, always, everywhere, and in everything acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Not only must we do this ourselves, but we must also vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, letting the people of the world revolution act according to Mao Zedong Thought. In supporting the left, we vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the left; when on duty on trains, we organize passengers to study Chairman Mao's works; in the countryside, we help poor and lower-middle peasants set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and together with poor and lower-middle peasant comrades criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Liu Shaoqi promoted in the countryside; in the company's struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, we take loyalty to Chairman Mao as the most fundamental standard for transforming our worldview. We are determined to follow the great commander Chairman Mao for life, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to revolutionize for life!

		Comrade Li ChangWan, Political Instructor of the company where the late Comrade Liu YingJun served:

		Comrade Liu YingJun grew into a great communist warrior in just a few years, powerfully proving that Mao Zedong Thought is the sunshine and rain nurturing revolutionary warriors' growth. Comrade Liu YingJun's growth process is the process of firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in his mind. Usually, he serves the people wholeheartedly, and at critical moments when the people need him, he remains calm and fearless, using his body to block a galloping horse, saving six children.

		What is most precious and worthy of our learning from Comrade Liu YingJun in his short life is his efforts to study Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely walk the path of heroes, determined to be like heroes, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide all our actions, making the study, implementation, propagation, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought our lifelong battle mission, spreading Mao Zedong Thought to the five lakes and four seas.

		Comrade Nian SiWang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao:

		The boundless Mao Zedong Thought is our revolutionary treasure. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can defeat any enemy! When class enemies sabotage trains, it is Mao Zedong Thought commanding me to rush forward, protecting the people's lives and property.

		Revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought! We revolutionary soldiers, as long as we arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, can forever maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit, tightly follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize to the end! I will regard studying Chairman Mao's works as my first need in life, reading Chairman Mao's books for life, struggling against selfishness for life, criticizing revisionism for life, and revolutionizing for life. With one heart, I will tightly follow the great commander Chairman Mao, forever being a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

		Comrades Wang ChuanYou, Political Instructor, Fan ShouAn, and Chen ChongLin, Soldiers of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road":

		Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, the root of revolution. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts, the brightest eyes, and the firmest stance. On Nanjing Road, class enemies boasted that we would enter red and exit black. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to remain pure amidst the bustling city, defeating the resourceful attacks of the bourgeoisie, not only avoiding corruption but also using the boundless Mao Zedong Thought to transform Nanjing Road.

		Comrade Lin Biao's inscription fully expresses our feelings. We will, with a new posture, further launch a new high tide of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide all our actions, making the company a red Mao Zedong Thought university, forever following Chairman Mao, advancing the Chinese revolution and world revolution to the end.

		Comrades Zhang Shuo, Deputy Political Commissar, and Wang GuoAn, Deputy Platoon Leader, Representatives of the Heroic Collective of the 1124 Construction Site:

		Comrade Lin Biao's inscription is a new mobilization order for our army's revolutionary construction and the general guideline for all our actions. Mao Zedong Thought is our soul; we will unify all our actions under Mao Zedong Thought. Our 1124 construction site could overcome a major collapse because of Mao Zedong Thought. One night, we were working at the "Tiger's Mouth," suddenly more than fifty cubic meters of stones with mud rushed down. To rescue the injured comrades, we rushed into the rain of falling stones, commanding each other with Mao Zedong Thought, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," rescuing the injured comrades, overcoming the major collapse, and subduing the "Tiger's Mouth." Facts prove that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are selfless, fearless, and invincible.

		Comrade Fan GuangLiang, Sergeant of the "Sea Tiger Boat":

		"The sea requires a helmsman, revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought." This is the great truth of proletarian revolution. Our "Sea Tiger Boat" relies on this great truth to fiercely attack and sink enemy warships in battles against armed enemies; on the battlefield of great criticism, we use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely attack Liu Shaoqi; on the battlefield of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, we use the "Three Articles" as a weapon to fiercely struggle against and establish "selflessness," advancing on the road of ideological revolutionization. We resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to revolutionize, struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, forever being the vanguard of revolution, and achieving new merits for the people.

		Comrade Xu ZuSong, Political Instructor of the "Red Spearhead Company":

		How do the Chinese people and the people of the world revolutionize? Comrade Lin Biao's inscription teaches us: Revolutionize with Mao Zedong Thought! With the great helmsman Chairman Mao at the helm and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought arming the revolutionary people, this is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of our country's revolution and world revolution, and also the fundamental guarantee for the construction and victory of our army.

		Our company was established in October 1939 and has grown under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought for twenty-eight years. In recent years, under the guidance of the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the expanded meeting of the Military Commission, we have firmly fought against the bourgeois military line promoted by Luo Ruiqing, firmly emphasizing proletarian politics, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, greatly strengthening the revolutionary construction of our company. All these rely on the great Mao Zedong Thought. All our comrades in the company unanimously believe: The Red Spearhead Company must be red in political thought and sharp in revolutionization! With Mao Zedong Thought, we have everything! Without Mao Zedong Thought, even with eyes, we cannot distinguish enemies from friends, and even with ears, we cannot hear good from bad words! We must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought our soul, forever following Chairman Mao to revolutionize to the end!

		Taking Comrade Lin Biao as a Brilliant Example, Unconditionally Loyal to Chairman Mao

		Comrade Wang YuChang, Deputy Section Chief and Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works in the Air Force:

		Comrade Lin Biao's inscription expounds the greatest truth in the contemporary world: The world must advance with Chairman Mao at the helm; the people must revolutionize with the great Mao Zedong Thought.

		Comrade Lin Biao is the best example of practicing this great truth. Comrade Lin Biao has always most resolutely defended Chairman Mao's supreme leadership position, most faithfully implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and most correctly propagated and defended the great Mao Zedong Thought. We must take Comrade Lin Biao as a brilliant example, learn from Comrade Lin Biao, most resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, better actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, be the vanguard of struggling against selfishness, and the spearhead of criticizing revisionism. Relying on the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will overthrow imperialism, overthrow revisionism, overthrow a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and overthrow the "self" in our minds, achieving new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and new battle tasks.

		Comrade Hu ShouGen, First-Class Hero and Pilot of a Certain Unit in the Air Force:

		Comrade Lin Biao studies, uses, and follows Mao Zedong Thought the best, holding the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought the highest. Comrade Lin Biao has given the most comprehensive, correct, and scientific evaluation of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, making great contributions to the Chinese revolution and world revolution.

		Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Liu YingJun, Cai YongXiang, Li WenZhong, and many heroic figures and advanced collectives that have emerged in our army in recent years are all the results of resolutely responding to Comrade Lin Biao's great call, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

		We must seriously study Comrade Lin Biao's inscription, be like Comrade Lin Biao, fighting for life to study, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought!

		Comrade Sun LeYi, Logistics Director of a Certain Unit in the Jinan Military Region and Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works:

		Comrade Lin Biao's inscription speaks to our hearts. We must forever follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao, advancing through stormy seas! We must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to advance the Chinese revolution and world revolution to the end!

		Comrade Lin Biao's inscription is a new great call for us to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. I will resolutely execute Comrade Lin Biao's battle order, taking "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, vigorously studying and applying the "Three Articles," bringing the issue of the two-line struggle to Chairman Mao's works to find answers, tightly following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, regarding actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as air, food, and the first need in life, in any time and any place, always putting actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the highest, greatest, first, and heaviest position, fighting offensive battles in struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, criticizing revisionism in struggling against selfishness, and struggling against selfishness in criticizing revisionism. We must take Comrade Lin Biao as a brilliant example, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, advancing greatly on the revolutionary road guided by Chairman Mao!

		Comrade Xie Qi, Former Platoon Leader of the platoon where the late model for loving the people, Comrade Xie Chen, served:

		Comrade Lin Biao's inscription is a new call to arms, mobilization order, and battle cry for firmly establishing the absolute authority of the great commander Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao is the model for the entire army, party, and nation to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. The heroes and models of our army are all grown by responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Comrade Li WenZhong, a model for supporting the left and serving the people, is a hero nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Li WenZhong commands every second of his life with Mao Zedong Thought and commands every action with Mao Zedong Thought. My brother Xie Chen and he are the same, acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings, sacrificing his life for the people's interests. I will learn from them, forever acting according to Comrade Lin Biao's teachings, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, forever being loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, being good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

    大海航行靠舵手　干革命靠毛泽东思想
    ——全军学习毛主席著作积极分子、英雄模范、先进单位代表畅谈林副主席题词
    全军学习毛主席著作积极分子、英雄模范、先进集体的代表，听到我们敬爱的林彪副主席给海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会题词的喜讯后，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的激动心情，千遍万遍高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”千遍万遍祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！大家畅谈林副主席题词的伟大意义，倾吐了自己的最大决心：“离北京千山万水，跟毛主席寸步不离！”
      永远跟着伟大舵手毛主席，在大风大浪中胜利前进
    “学习毛主席著作的模范红九连”班长仇国贤：
    林副主席的题词：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，最集中地表达了我们革命战士对毛主席、对毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的阶级感情。
    我们连是四十年前伟大领袖毛主席在井冈山亲自缔造的一支红军连队。几十年来，一直跟着毛主席南征北战闹革命。我们要永远跟着毛主席闹革命。毛主席过去、现在和将来永远是我们的最高统帅。我们的红心永远向着红太阳。支左爱民模范李文忠生前所在排的同志说得好：不信天，不信地，一心信仰毛主席。他们说出了我们的心里话。永远忠于毛主席，就要“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”。我们连响应林副主席的号召，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，连队的思想革命化日益加强，一批一批的红色接班人成长起来。今后，我们要永远永远地活学活用毛主席著作，不断实现思想革命化，永远永远地跟着伟大统帅毛主席胜利前进！
    支左爱民模范李文忠生前所在连连长杨效忠、排长庞朝胜：
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，这是千真万确的真理。支左爱民模范李文忠，就是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的。李文忠同志最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。他说：“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席称赞我称赞，毛主席指示我照办。”这四句话是他在革命实践中活学活用毛主席著作的经验结晶，充满了革命战士对伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想的无限热爱，无限忠诚。他把这四句话刻在脑子里，落实在行动上，因此，在关键时刻，他能挺身而出，英勇抢救红卫兵。学习林副主席的题词，我们就要象李文忠同志那样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，真正做到、永远做到：毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做！
    全军学习毛主席著作积极分子、教导员黄祖示：
    林副主席的题词，说出了我们革命战士最大最大的心愿，使我激动得热血沸腾，千言万语并作一句话：祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！祝林副主席身体健康！永远健康！
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。跟着毛主席，照毛主席指引的航向前进，就是胜利！我们部队遵照毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，坚决支持左派。在支左中，党内一小撮走资派怕得要死，他们对我们进行威胁、围攻。这时，我们反复学习毛主席的教导：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，好象毛主席就在我们身边，指挥我们勇敢地进行斗争。大家不怕苦，不怕累，深入工厂、学校，宣传毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想的巨大的威力，使革命群众组织削平了“山头”，消除了隔阂，实现了革命大联合，彻底地孤立了党内一小撮走资派，取得了革命、生产的新胜利。
    我们革命战士，无限热爱毛主席，步步紧跟毛主席，寸步不离毛主席。我们一定永远永远沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道，乘风破浪，奋勇前进！
    王杰生前所在班班长刘成科：
    林副主席的题词，字字句句说到我们心坎上。我们要坚决照办，永远照办！
    按林副主席题词去办，最根本的就是要永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，时时、处处、事事按毛主席指示办事。不仅自己要这样做，还要大力宣传毛泽东思想，让世界革命人民都按毛泽东思想办事。我们在支左中，大力宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装左派；在列车上执勤时，我们组织旅客学习毛主席著作；在农村，我们帮助贫下中农开办毛泽东思想学习班，和贫下中农社员一起批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村提出和推行的反革命修正主义路线；在连队进行斗私批修中，我们把忠于毛主席当作改造世界观的最根本的标准。我们决心一辈子紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，靠毛泽东思想干一辈子革命！
    靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想
    将中国革命、世界革命进行到底
    刘英俊生前所在连指导员李昌万：
    刘英俊同志在短短的几年中，成长为伟大的共产主义战士，最有力地证明了毛泽东思想是哺育革命战士成长的阳光雨露。刘英俊同志的成长过程，就是在头脑里大树特树毛泽东思想绝对权威的过程。他平时全心全意为人民服务，当人民需要的关键时刻，他面不改色心不跳，用自己的身体挡住狂奔的战马，挽救了六名儿童。
    刘英俊在他短短的一生中最可宝贵的最值得我们学习的，就是他努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想。我们坚决走英雄的道路，决心象英雄那样，活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，用毛泽东思想统帅自己的一切行动，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，当作毕生的战斗任务，把毛泽东思想传播到五湖四海。
    毛主席的好战士年四旺：
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是我们革命的法宝。有了毛泽东思想，不管什么样的敌人都能战胜它！当阶级敌人破坏列车时，是毛泽东思想指挥着我冲上前去，保护了人民的生命财产。
    干革命靠毛泽东思想！我们革命战士只要用毛泽东思想武装头脑，就能永远保持旺盛的革命精神，紧跟毛主席革命到底！我要把学习毛主席著作，当做生命的第一需要，读一辈子毛主席的书，斗一辈子“私”字，批一辈子“修”字，干一辈子革命。一个心眼紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，永远做毛主席的好战士。
    “南京路上好八连”指导员王传友、战士范守安、陈冲林：
    毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是革命的根本。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，心最红，眼最亮，立场最坚定。在南京路上，阶级敌人扬言要我们红着进，黑着出。我们就靠毛泽东思想身居闹市一尘不染，打垮了资产阶级用糖衣裹着的炮弹的进攻，不仅不受腐蚀，反而用光焰无际的毛泽东思想改造了南京路。
    林副主席的题词，充分表达了我们的心里话。我们要以新的姿态，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，用毛泽东思想统帅我们的一切，把连队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，永远跟着毛主席，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底。
    一一二四工地英雄集体的代表、某团副政委张澍、副班长王国安：
    林副主席的题词，是我军革命化建设的新的动员令，是我们一切行动的总纲领。毛泽东思想是我们的灵魂，我们要把一切行动都统一在毛泽东思想上。我们一一二四工地，所以能战胜特大塌方，就是靠毛泽东思想。一个晚上，我们在“老虎口”进行作业，突然五十多立方石头带着泥沙倾泻下来，为了抢救遇难战友，我们冒着生命危险冲进落石如雨的“老虎口”，大家在毛泽东思想指挥下，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，救出了遇难战友，战胜了大塌方，制服了“老虎口”。事实证明，毛泽东思想武装起来的人无私、无畏、无敌。
    “海上猛虎艇”军士长樊广亮：
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。这是无产阶级革命的伟大真理。我们“海上猛虎艇”靠这一伟大的真理，在同拿枪的敌人的战斗中，猛打猛冲，用小艇打沉了敌人大兵舰；在革命大批判的战场上，我们以毛泽东思想为武器，向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火；在斗私批修战场上，我们以“老三篇”为武器，狠斗猛斗“私”字，大立“公”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命，在思想革命化的道路上阔步前进。我们坚决响应林副主席号召，靠毛泽东思想干革命，靠毛泽东思想斗私批修，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，永当革命的先锋，为人民立新功。
    “红色尖刀连”指导员徐祖松：
    中国人民和世界人民靠什么干革命？林副主席的题词教导我们：靠毛泽东思想干革命！有伟大舵手毛主席掌舵，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想把革命人民武装起来，这是我国革命和世界革命取得胜利的根本保证，也是我军建设和胜利的根本保证。
    我们连是一九三九年十月组建的，二十八年来，在毛泽东思想指引下不断成长。近几年来，我们在古田会议决议和军委扩大会议决议的指引下，和罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线进行了坚决的斗争，坚定地突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，大大加强了连队的革命化建设。所有这些，靠的都是伟大的毛泽东思想。我们全连同志一致认为：红色尖刀连就要红在政治思想上，尖在革命化上！有了毛泽东思想就有了一切！没有毛泽东思想，有眼也分不清敌友，有耳也听不出好话坏话！我们一定要努力学习毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想化为我们的灵魂，永远跟着毛主席革命到底！
    以林副主席为光辉榜样，　无限忠于毛主席
    空军学习毛主席著作积极分子、副科长王裕昌：
    林副主席题词阐明了当代世界上最伟大的真理：世界要前进，就要毛主席来掌舵；人民要革命，就得靠伟大的毛泽东思想。
    林副主席是实践这一伟大真理最好的典范。林副主席一贯最坚决地维护毛主席的最高领袖地位，最忠实地执行毛主席的革命路线，最正确地宣传、捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想。我们要以林副主席为光辉榜样，向林副主席学习，最最坚决地响应林副主席的号召，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，作斗私的先锋，当批修的闯将。靠伟大的毛泽东思想，革帝国主义的命，革修正主义的命，革党内一小撮走资派的命，革头脑中“私”字的命，在无产阶级文化大革命中，在新的战斗任务中为人民立新功。
    空军某部飞行员、一等功胡寿根：
    林副主席对伟大的毛泽东思想学得最好，用得最活，跟得最紧，毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高。林副主席对毛泽东思想作了最全面、最正确、最科学的评价，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，对中国革命和世界革命作出了伟大的贡献。
    雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、刘英俊、蔡永祥、李文忠，以及近几年来我军出现的许多英雄人物和先进集体，都是坚决响应林副主席的伟大号召，活学活用毛主席著作，大树特树毛泽东思想绝对权威的结果。
    我们一定要认真地学习林副主席的题词，象林副主席那样，为学习、贯彻、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想战斗一生！
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、济南部队某部后勤处长孙乐义：
    林副主席的题词，字字句句说到了我们心坎里，我们就是要永远跟着伟大舵手毛主席在大风大浪里前进！我们就是要靠毛泽东思想把中国革命和世界革命进行到底！
    林副主席的题词，是向我们发出的活学活用毛主席著作的新的伟大号召。我一定坚决执行林副主席的这一战斗号令，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠学狠用“老三篇”，带着两条路线斗争的问题，到毛主席著作里找答案，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，把活学活用毛主席著作当作空气、粮食，作为生命的第一需要，在任何时候，任何场合，都要把活学活用毛主席著作，放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的位置上，在斗私批修中打进攻战，在批修中斗私，在斗私中批修。我们要以林副主席为光辉榜样，大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席革命路线的绝对权威，在毛主席指引的革命道路上，大踏步地前进！
    “爱民模范”谢臣生前所在班原班长谢起：
    林副主席的题词，是大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大毛泽东思想的绝对权威的新的号召书、动员令、进军号。林副主席是全军、全党、全国大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想绝对权威的典范。我军的英雄模范都是响应林副主席号召，活学活用毛主席著作成长起来的。支左爱民模范李文忠同志，就是毛泽东思想哺育成长的英雄。李文忠同志用毛泽东思想统帅生命的每一秒钟，用毛泽东思想指挥每一个行动。我哥哥谢臣和他一样，按照毛主席的教导，为了人民的利益献出了自己的生命，我要学习他们，永远按照林副主席的教导，活学活用毛主席著作，大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，做毛主席的好战士！（新华社）
