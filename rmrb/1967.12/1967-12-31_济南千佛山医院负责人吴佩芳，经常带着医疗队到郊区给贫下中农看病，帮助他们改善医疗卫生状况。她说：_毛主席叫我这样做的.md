Jinan Qianfoshan Hospital leader Wu Peifang often leads medical teams to rural areas to treat poor and lower-middle class farmers, helping to improve their medical and health conditions. She said: “Chairman Mao told me to do this.”

Since being elected by the masses to a leadership position, Jinan Qianfoshan Hospital nurse Wu Peifang has been extremely busy every day: overseeing the criticism and self-criticism within the unit, arranging daily work, visiting various wards… However, no matter how busy the work is, she always finds time to go to the rural areas of Yaodou Commune to treat the poor and lower-middle class farmers. Someone asked her, “You are so busy with work, why do you keep going to the mountains?” She replied, “Chairman Mao told me to do this!”

In 1960, Wu Peifang came to Qianfoshan Hospital. After a period of time, she increasingly felt that the hospital's practices were completely contrary to Chairman Mao's teachings. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the party had turned the hospital into a bourgeois-style haven of comfort, with an average of five people attending to one patient. She thought, “Now, in the countryside, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle class farmers still lack medicine and doctors. We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings and shift the focus of medical and health work to the countryside.” Thus, she proposed to everyone to organize a medical team to go to remote mountain areas to serve the poor and lower-middle class farmers. This proposal was enthusiastically supported by the majority of medical staff in the hospital. When the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party found out, they obstructed from all sides and threatened her, saying, “You are just a nurse. What can you accomplish down there! If something goes wrong, you won't be able to come back!” Wu Peifang firmly replied, “Following Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the five hundred million farmers, this path we will definitely take. With Chairman Mao supporting us, we are not afraid of anything!”

Under the leadership of Comrade Wu Peifang, a small medical team worked tirelessly, day in and day out, wholeheartedly serving the broad masses of poor and lower-middle class farmers in the rural areas.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Wu Peifang and her comrades-in-arms together, thoroughly criticized the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and seized their power. Soon she was elected as the leader of the entire hospital's service team. Heavy work responsibilities were placed on her shoulders, but she never forgot Chairman Mao's great teachings and continued to lead the medical team to the deep mountains of Yaodou Commune to treat the poor and lower-middle class farmers.

This small village has only about fifty households. In the past, if someone fell ill, they had to be carried on a stretcher to Jinan City for treatment. After Wu Peifang and the medical team arrived, they studied Chairman Mao's works with the commune members, worked together, and went deep into the fields and mountains, treating illnesses while propagating Mao Zedong Thought. They also conducted a comprehensive physical examination for all the commune members, understanding the health status of the entire village, and often lectured to the commune members on the prevention and treatment of common and frequently occurring diseases, as well as health knowledge. Old poor peasant Liu Jingyu, due to meningitis, was paralyzed and bedridden for three years. Wu Peifang treated him with acupuncture every day for three months and finally cured the disease. Old Liu was tearfully shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!” The medical team led by Comrade Wu Peifang also trained two health workers for this village. The poor and lower-middle class farmers said, “Comrade Wu is truly a close friend of ours, the poor and lower-middle class farmers.”

    济南千佛山医院负责人吴佩芳，经常带着医疗队到郊区给贫下中农看病，帮助他们改善医疗卫生状况。她说：
    “毛主席叫我这样做的”
    济南千佛山医院护士吴佩芳，自从被群众推举到领导岗位上以后，每天工作都非常忙碌：抓本单位的大批判，安排每天的工作，到各病房去查看……。但是，不管工作怎样忙，她总要抽出一些时间，到郊区窑头公社去给贫下中农看病。有人问她：“你工作这么忙，为什么还老是往山沟里跑呢？”她回答说：“是毛主席叫我这样做的！”
    一九六○年，吴佩芳来到千佛山医院。经过一段时间，她愈来愈感觉到，医院里推行的一套，是完全违背毛主席的教导的。党内一小撮走资派，把医院办成了一座资产阶级式的安乐窝，一个病人平均就有五个人伺候。她想，现在农村中广大贫下中农还缺医少药，我们应当按照毛主席的教导，把医疗卫生的重点放到农村去。于是，她向大伙建议组织一个医疗队，到偏僻山区去为贫下中农服务。这个建议得到了全院大多数医务人员的积极响应。党内一小撮走资派知道以后，就从各方面进行阻挠，并威胁她说：“你是一个护士，到下面能搞出什么名堂！如果闯出祸来，你们就别想回来了。”吴佩芳坚定地回答说：“按毛主席的教导办事，为五亿农民服务，这条路我们走定了，有毛主席他老人家为我们撑腰，我们什么也不怕！”
    在吴佩芳同志的带领下，一支小型的医疗队早出晚归，一心一意地为郊区的广大贫下中农服务。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，吴佩芳和她的战友们一起，大造了党内一小撮走资派的反，夺了他们的权。不久她被选为全院勤务组的负责人。繁忙的工作担子压在她的肩上，但是，她始终没有忘掉毛主席的伟大教导，继续带领医疗队来到大山沟里的窑头公社，为贫下中农治病。
    这个小山村只有五十来户人家。过去有人害了病，得用担架抬到济南市去治疗。吴佩芳和医疗队的同志们来到这里以后，和社员们一起学习毛主席著作，一起劳动，深入田头和山头，一面治疗，一面宣传毛泽东思想。他们还给全村社员作了全面的体格检查，摸清全村社员的健康状况，经常向社员讲解一些常见病和多发病的防治方法以及卫生常识。老贫农刘经玉由于得了脑膜炎，全身瘫痪，躺了三年。吴佩芳每天给刘经玉作针灸，医治了三个月，终于把病治好了。刘大爷热泪盈眶地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    吴佩芳同志带领的医疗队，还给这个村培养了两个卫生员。贫下中农说：“吴同志真是俺贫下中农的贴心人。”
