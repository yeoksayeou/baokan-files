After the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power, whether they can maintain and carry forward the Party's style of hard struggle is a very important issue concerning whether they can retain the character of proletarian revolutionaries and whether they can continue to firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and revolutionize forever.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without the style of hard struggle, one cannot implement a firm and correct political direction."

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to implement the proletarian revolutionary line and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, it is impossible without unyielding and indomitable struggle. The proletarian revolutionary faction, through sharp and complex struggles, has crushed the frenzied resistance of the class enemy and seized power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. After taking power, they must still carry forward the revolutionary spirit, maintain the style of hard struggle, and be constantly on guard against the attacks of the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, and eliminate the influence of old habits and forces. They must not become arrogant and self-satisfied, indulge in enjoyment, show off, flaunt wealth, or waste money because of victory. They must not think that these are trivial matters. Because "peaceful evolution" often starts from these small things. "A small ant's hole can breach a thousand-li dike." If our comrades are infected with bourgeois habits, they will inevitably become listless and stagnant, fall into the mire of vulgarity, and even go astray. Thus, the power you hold will change, and there is a danger of losing it.

Seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party is only the beginning of holding and using power well; it is the prologue to a long play. The proletarian revolutionary faction must use the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong to overcome revisionist thoughts and various bourgeois thoughts, so that in any situation, they can stand firm, be full of fighting spirit, struggle hard, and forever maintain the revolutionary character of the proletariat.

### 艰苦奋斗　永远革命

　　艰苦奋斗　永远革命
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，能不能保持和发扬我党艰苦奋斗的作风，是关系到能否保持无产阶级革命者的本色，能否继续坚定不移地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、永远革命的一个十分重要的问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有艰苦奋斗的工作作风，也就不能执行坚定正确的政治方向。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，要贯彻执行无产阶级革命路线，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，不经过不屈不挠、坚忍不拔的斗争，是不可能的。无产阶级革命派经过尖锐、复杂的斗争，打垮阶级敌人的疯狂反抗，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权；掌权以后，仍然要发扬革命精神，保持艰苦奋斗的作风，时刻警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击，排除旧习惯势力的影响。绝不能因为胜利而骄傲自满、贪图享受、讲排场、摆阔气、铺张浪费。绝不能认为这是生活小事。因为“和平演变”往往是从这些小事“变”起的。“蝼蚁之穴溃千里之堤”。如果我们的同志沾染上资产阶级习气，必然会变得委靡不振，暮气沉沉，陷入庸俗的泥潭，甚至走到邪路上去。于是，你所掌握的权就会发生变化，就有丧失的危险。
    夺取党内一小撮走资派的权，仅仅是掌好权，用好权的开始，是一出长剧的序幕。无产阶级革命派要掌好权，用好权，必须用光焰无际的毛泽东思想去战胜修正主义思想和形形色色的资产阶级思想，使自己在任何情况下，都能够立场坚定，斗志昂扬，艰苦奋斗，永远保持无产阶级的革命本色。
