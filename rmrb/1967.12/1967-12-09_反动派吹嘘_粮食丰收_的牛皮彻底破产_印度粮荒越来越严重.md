New Delhi, Dec. 6 (Xinhua) — The Indian reactionary government's boast of a "bumper harvest" this year has completely collapsed. Reactionary government officials have recently been forced to admit that past estimates were "exaggerated."

To deceive the Indian people, who are suffering from severe famine, and to ease their discontent and resistance towards its reactionary rule, the Indian reactionary government had boasted that India would definitely achieve a "bumper harvest" this year and that Indian farmers would have a surplus of grain.

However, the lies were quickly exposed. The famine in India is becoming increasingly severe. In many regions, grain is often unavailable, and the masses are starving. According to a recent report by the Indian magazine *Link*, in Kerala State, the long-term shortage of grain has reached 58% of the required amount. The reactionary central government had promised to ration six ounces (approximately 5.4 market ounces) of grain per person per day. However, even this insufficient ration could not be fulfilled. Since April, the ration has been reduced to three ounces per person per day. But in October, even this amount could not be guaranteed. From November to now, there has been no news on how much grain will be rationed. The magazine said that it seems "even the three-ounce ration system will collapse." In Mysore State, a family of four can only buy 0.75 kilograms of grain in a week. India today is a scene of darkness with corpses of the starved everywhere.

The facts have given a resounding slap in the face to the Indian reactionary government that boasted of a "bumper harvest"! The British *Times* reported on Dec. 4 that the Indian government has recently had to "feel pessimistic about the harvest" and has painted a gloomy picture of the previously much-discussed "bumper harvest." The deputy chairman of the Indian government's Planning Commission, Gajjar, had to admit after a meeting of the National Development Council: "The earlier estimates of a bumper harvest and farmers having a large surplus (of grain) may have been exaggerated," and the National Development Council "has had to revise its plans."

### 反动派吹嘘“粮食丰收”的牛皮彻底破产  印度粮荒越来越严重

    反动派吹嘘“粮食丰收”的牛皮彻底破产
    印度粮荒越来越严重
    新华社六日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府吹嘘的今年“粮食丰收”已经破产。反动政府官员近来不得不承认过去的估计“夸大了”。
    印度反动政府为了欺骗处于严重饥荒中的印度人民，缓和人民对它的反动统治的不满和反抗，曾经大肆吹嘘今年印度一定会获得“粮食丰收”，印度农民“会有大量余粮”。
    但是，谎言很快破产。印度的粮荒情况越来越严重。许多地区，经常买不到粮食，广大人民处于饥饿之中。据印度《联系》周刊最近报道，在喀拉拉邦，长期缺粮的数字达到需要量的百分之五十八。反动的中央政府曾经答应每人每天配给粮食六英两
  （约合五点四市两）。但是就连这点吃不饱的配给量，也不能兑现。从今年四月以来，配给量又减少到每人每天三英两。可是，十月份连三英两也不能保障。从十一月到现在，配给多少的消息也没有了。这家周刊说，看样子，“连三英两的配给制度也将垮台。”在迈索尔邦，一个四口之家，一周之内只能买到零点七五公斤的粮食。现在的印度，正是一片饿殍遍野的黑暗情景。
    事实向吹嘘“粮食丰收”的印度反动政府脸上打了响亮的耳光！英国《泰晤士报》四日说：印度政府最近不得不“对收成感到悲观”，并对“曾经大事谈论的粮食丰收绘下一幅暗淡的图景”。印度政府计划委员会副主席加吉尔在国家发展委员会的一次会议后不得不承认：“早些时候关于丰收和农民会有大量剩余（粮食）的估计或许是夸大了”，国家发展委员会“不得不修改它的计划”。
