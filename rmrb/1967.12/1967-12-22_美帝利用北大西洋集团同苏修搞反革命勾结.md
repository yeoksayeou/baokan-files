To adapt to the needs of the global counterrevolutionary strategy and to boost the morale of the dying invasion bloc, the U.S. Empire is using NATO to collude with Soviet revisionists in counterrevolutionary activities.

NATO meeting praises Soviet revisionists' capitulation to the U.S. Empire and the full restoration of capitalism.

New China News Agency, Brussels: At a time when the U.S. Empire and Soviet revisionists are tightening their global counterrevolutionary collusion, the disintegrating NATO invasion bloc held its annual winter ministerial meeting on December 13 and 14 in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. This meeting shows that to adapt to the needs of the U.S. Empire's global strategy and to inject new life into this dying invasion bloc, U.S. imperialism is using this bloc as a tool to collude with the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in counterrevolutionary activities.

The meeting, controlled by the U.S. Empire, highly praised the Soviet revisionists' betrayal and capitulation to U.S. imperialism and their evil deeds of fully restoring capitalism at home. A report titled "The Tasks of the Alliance in the Future" adopted by the meeting openly declared that the Soviet Union's "principle of peaceful coexistence" has changed the nature of its confrontation with the West, and that the evolution of Soviet and Eastern European policies gives reason to hope that the governments of these countries will eventually recognize the benefits of joint efforts for a peaceful settlement (of European issues). The so-called "peaceful settlement" of European issues propagated here refers to the joint maintenance of their rule in Europe by the imperialists and revisionists, and further strengthening their counterrevolutionary collusion to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The report of the meeting believes that due to the "significant changes" in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, the "political tasks" of this bloc have taken on new dimensions. The main responsibility of NATO in the future is to "maintain an appropriate military force" while making progress in "establishing a relatively stable relationship" with the Soviet revisionist bloc and "promoting further easing of East-West relations," so as to "achieve a just and lasting peace order in Europe," that is, to maintain the old counterrevolutionary order of imperialist and revisionist rule in Europe.

Based on the unanimous assessment that the "threat of the Soviet Union to Western Europe has become a thing of the past," the meeting discussed and approved the bloc's "five-year (military) force plan" until the end of 1972. It is revealed that the meeting plans to reduce the bloc's troops stationed in Western Europe from the originally planned 30 divisions to 20 divisions, and to approve the further reduction of U.S. troops in West Germany, in order to alleviate the U.S. Empire's desperate situation of heavy casualties in the Vietnam War and depleted domestic manpower. The communiqué issued after the meeting openly demands that the Soviet revisionist bloc further cooperate with the U.S. Empire's plan to move military forces eastward and to "reduce troops on both sides in Europe."

The U.S. imperialism, which is increasingly defeated in the Vietnam War, has tried in every possible way to drag its Western European "allies" into the Vietnam quagmire. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk has repeatedly sought support for the Vietnam War in the ministerial meetings of this bloc. According to French newspapers, the U.S. again demanded "collective intervention by the alliance in crises outside the Atlantic Treaty region" when drafting the report on the bloc's "future tasks." However, its "allies," who are preoccupied with their own affairs, are unwilling to take the risk for the U.S., and their response is very cold. Rusk, at this meeting, reiterated the U.S.'s insistence on invading Vietnam and peddled the "peace talks" fraud, but dared not again propose the demand for Western European countries to participate in the U.S.'s Vietnam War.

This meeting was the first ministerial meeting held after France, for the purpose of competing with the U.S. for hegemony, expelled the bloc's headquarters from Paris. Despite Rusk's repeated attempts to boost morale before and after the meeting, shouting that NATO will not "collapse" and must "continue to exist," even U.S. congressmen had to admit that "no matter how many official gestures are made," they cannot cover up the "stunning decline" of this bloc.

Under the heavy blows of the world's revolutionary storms, the U.S. Empire's various schemes to prolong the life of NATO are in vain; the accelerating decline of imperialism and the accelerating disintegration of the invasion blocs they have patched together are something that the U.S. Empire, Soviet revisionists, and their partners cannot rescue.

### 美帝利用北大西洋集团同苏修搞反革命勾结

    为适应反革命全球战略需要　给奄奄一息的侵略集团打气
    美帝利用北大西洋集团同苏修搞反革命勾结
    北大西洋集团会议为苏修投靠美帝和全面复辟资本主义叫好
    新华社讯　布鲁塞尔消息：在美帝苏修加紧全球性的反革命大勾结的时候，分崩离析的北大西洋侵略集团十三日和十四日在比利时首都布鲁塞尔举行了一年一度的冬季部长理事会会议。这次会议表明，为了适应美帝全球战略的需要，并且给这个奄奄一息的侵略集团注射强心针，美帝国主义正在加紧利用这个集团作为同苏修统治集团进行反革命勾结的工具。
    美帝控制的这次会议对苏修卖身投靠美帝国主义，在国内全面实行资本主义复辟的罪恶行径大为夸奖。会议通过的一项所谓“联盟今后的任务”的报告公开宣称，“苏联的‘和平共处’原则已使它同西方的对抗的性质发生改变”，“苏联和东欧政策的演变，使人有理由希望这些国家政府终究会认识到为和平解决（欧洲问题）而共同努力对它们的好处。”这里所宣扬的共同“和平解决”欧洲问题，就是指帝修共同维护它们在欧洲的统治，并进而加强它们的反革命勾结，镇压亚非拉人民的革命斗争。
    会议的报告认为，由于苏联和一些东欧国家有了“重大的改变”，这个集团的“政治任务出现了新的范畴”。北大西洋集团今后的“主要职责”是在“保持一支适当的军事力量”的同时，“谋求（同苏修集团）建立一种比较稳定的关系方面取得进展”，“促进东西方关系的进一步和缓”，以便“在欧洲实现一种正义的持久的和平秩序”，也就是维持帝修统治欧洲的反革命旧秩序。
    这次会议根据“苏联对西欧的威胁已成为过去”的一致估计，讨论批准了这个集团到一九七二年底为止的“五年（军事）力量计划”。据透露，会议打算把这个集团驻西欧的部队从原定三十个师减少到二十个师，并且批准美国进一步减少在西德的驻军，以缓和美帝在侵越战场上伤亡惨重而国内又兵源枯竭的狼狈处境。会后发表的公报公开要求苏修集团进一步配合美帝军事力量东移的计划，在欧洲“双方平衡地裁减部队”。
    在侵越战争中越败越惨的美帝国主义，曾经千方百计地企图把它的西欧“盟国”拉进侵越泥潭。美国国务卿腊斯克曾一再在这个集团的部长理事会会议上声嘶力竭地寻求对侵越战争的支持。据法国报纸透露，这次在起草这个集团“今后任务”的报告时，美国又要求“联盟集体地干预大西洋条约地区以外的危机”，但是它的那些自顾不暇的“盟国”，不愿为美国火中取栗，反应十分冷淡。腊斯克在这次会议上除了重申美国坚持侵略越南的立场并贩卖“和谈”骗局以外，不敢再次提出要西欧国家参加美国侵越战争的要求。
    这次会议是在法国出于它同美国争霸的目的而把这个集团的总部赶出巴黎以后举行的第一次部长理事会会议。尽管腊斯克在会议前后一再打气，叫嚷什么北大西洋集团不会“搞垮”，要继续“存在下去”，可是连美国的议员都不得不承认，“不管官方作多少姿态”，都无法掩盖这个集团“惊人的衰落”。
    在世界人民革命风暴的沉重打击下，美帝国主义挖空心思想让北大西洋集团苟延残喘的各种如意打算，都是徒劳的；帝国主义加速没落，它们拼凑的侵略性军事集团加速分崩离析的命运，是美帝、苏修以及它们的伙伴们挽救不了的。
