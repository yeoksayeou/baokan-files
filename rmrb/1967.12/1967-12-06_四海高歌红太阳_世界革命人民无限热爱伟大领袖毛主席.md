The sun rises in the east, and rays of light shine in all directions. The four seas are in turmoil, and the five continents sing songs of praise. Chairman Mao, you are the savior of humanity, you are the hope of the world, you are the lighthouse in the mist, you are the red sun in the hearts of all revolutionary people around the world. Friends from the five continents choose the most beautiful words and sing the most beautiful songs to express their heartfelt wishes for your long life, Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

Only Mao Zedong Can Save the Oppressed People

One day in August, the Italian ship "Malatesta" docked at Zhanjiang Port. The crew members, full of enthusiasm, rushed to our staff, gesturing and asking for Chairman Mao's badges. They enthusiastically said, "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong, long live Mao Zedong!" Many crew members who received the badges were overjoyed, some even with tears in their eyes. At that time, the ship's cook was busy working in the kitchen. Upon hearing the news, he didn't even put down his utensils and rushed out, shouting, "I want a Mao Zedong badge, I want a Mao Zedong badge!" Later, he told our staff, "Getting a Mao Zedong badge is not easy! If I had come a step late, someone else would have taken it!" He then kissed the badge.

The ship's third officer, Koberla, told our staff, "Last time, I managed to get a copy of the Italian version of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' and some pamphlets, but when I returned to Italy, a few friends took them from me." He looked very regretful. Later, our border inspection officer gave him another copy of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' and 'Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?', and he was overjoyed. He solemnly held the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' and said, "Wonderful! Wonderful! Chinese friends understand me the best." "I deeply love the great Marx, Lenin, and Mao Zedong." When talking about Chairman Mao being the genius leader of all people in the world, he said, "God is a lie. Only Mao Zedong can save the oppressed people. Mao Zedong's books are the treasure for saving the oppressed people."

The Voice of All People Around the World

On the night of September 6 this year, people had already gone to sleep. Suddenly, a fuel worker from the Cypriot ship "Angrich" got out of bed and quietly walked to our duty personnel, begging the Chinese friends to teach him how to read and write the five shining words "Long live Chairman Mao" in Chinese. He said, "This sentence is the voice of all people around the world. Many of my friends and colleagues have learned it, but I haven't. Please teach me!" A few days later, he finally learned to read and write "Long live Chairman Mao." Whenever he saw Chinese friends, he would raise his thumb and shout in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Many mornings, many crew members stood on the deck, looking at the rising sun in the east and shouting, "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong, long live Chairman Mao!"

Singing "The East Is Red"

"The East is red, the sun is rising, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." This magnificent and powerful song inspires the revolutionary people of the world to forge ahead bravely. The crew members of the British ship "London" overcame many difficulties to learn this song to express their sincere admiration for Chairman Mao. To learn this song, they repeatedly asked our duty personnel to teach them. Our staff sang a sentence, and they followed along carefully, singing every day and humming all the time. To sing every note accurately, they even borrowed a Chinese record of "The East Is Red," listening and learning at the same time. After much effort, they finally learned it. They also recorded "The East Is Red" on a tape, planning to take it back to teach more people. An Indonesian crew member also asked our staff to translate "The East Is Red" into Indonesian, to sing at home. He excitedly said, "The East Is Red is fantastic."

Long Live Uncle Mao!

The Greek ship "Mitravassiliki" has a seven-year-old girl. This lively little girl loves Chairman Mao very much. She recites Chairman Mao's quotations and sings songs about Chairman Mao's quotations all day, shouting "Long live Uncle Mao!" She has already learned "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and many songs about Chairman Mao's quotations. She also has a delicate little box, in which she treasures more than forty Chairman Mao badges from various places. Whenever she sees Chinese uncles, she sings and dances, proudly showing off her little box, and loudly shouting "Uncle Mao is great! Long live Uncle Mao!"

Chairman Mao Is Always with Us

One day, our staff visited the cabin of the chief steward of the British ship "Lockington" and had a friendly chat. In this small room of only a few square meters, all four walls were pasted with a portrait of Chairman Mao, expressing his boundless admiration for Chairman Mao, the revolutionary leader of the people of the world. Our border inspection officer excitedly asked him why he pasted four portraits of Chairman Mao, and he excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is with us day and night! Chairman Mao's brilliance illuminates our path forward." Later, our staff also found that he had volumes one to four of the English version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He studied very hard, took notes, and drew red lines and emphasis marks in many places. He told our staff, "Mao Zedong's books are the lighthouse in the mist. Revolution cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought. I have drawn revolutionary strength from Mao Zedong's works."

    四海高歌红太阳
    ——世界革命人民无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席
    旭日东升，霞光万道，四海翻腾，五洲歌唱。毛主席啊，您是人类的救星，您是世界的希望，您是雾海中的灯塔，您是全世界革命人民心中的红太阳。来自五大洲的外国朋友，选择最美好的词句，唱起最动听的颂歌，衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
          只有毛泽东才能拯救被压迫人民
    八月的一天，意大利籍“马笠川昆路”轮，刚在湛江港靠岸，船员们热情洋溢地涌向我工作人员面前，比划着手势，纷纷索取毛主席像章。并热情地说：“毛泽东”，“毛泽东”，“毛泽东万岁！”许多船员得到了像章，乐得手舞足蹈，有的甚至热泪盈眶。这时，该轮的厨师正在埋头干活，一听到这喜讯，连手中的厨具也忘记放下，就三步并作两步从厨房里飞跑出来，高声说：“我要毛泽东的像章，我要毛泽东的像章”。后来他对我工作人员说：“得到一枚毛泽东的像章可不容易啊！如果来迟了一步，就给别人要光了！”说完，他吻了吻像章。
    该轮的三副考柏拉对我工作人员说：“上次，我好容易得到了一本意文版的《毛主席语录》和一些单行本，可是回到意大利时，又被几个朋友要走了。”说完后表现出很遗憾的样子。后来，我边防检查员又送给他一本《毛主席语录》和《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》，他可乐开了。他庄重地捧着《毛主席语录》说：“太好了！太好了！中国朋友最理解我。”“我十分热爱伟大的马克思、列宁和毛泽东。”当谈到毛主席是全世界人民的天才领袖时，他说：“上帝是空的，是骗人的。只有毛泽东才能拯救被压迫人民。毛泽东的书是拯救被压迫人民的宝书。”
          全世界人民的心声
    今年九月六日深夜，人们已经入睡了。忽然塞浦路斯籍“安格里奇”轮的一个加油工，从床上爬了起来，轻轻地走到我执勤人员面前，恳求中国朋友教他用中文读和写“毛主席万岁”这五个闪闪发光的大字。他说，“这句话是全世界人民的心声。我的很多朋友和同事都学会了，我还未学会，请你教会我吧！”几天以后，他终于会读会写“毛主席万岁”了。每当见到中国朋友，他就竖起大拇指用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”很多个早晨，许多船员都站在甲板上，望着东方的一轮红太阳欢呼：“毛泽东，毛泽东，毛主席万岁！”
          高唱《东方红》
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”这支雄浑壮丽的颂歌，激发世界革命人民奋勇向前。英籍“伦敦”轮的海员为了唱会这首颂歌，克服了很多困难，表达了他们对毛主席的由衷爱戴。为了学会这首歌，他们再三请我执勤人员教他们唱。我工作人员唱一句，他们也聚精会神地跟一句，并且天天唱，时时哼。为了把每个音符都唱准确，他们还想方设法借来了一张《东方红》的中国唱片，一边听、一边学。经过一番努力，终于学会了。他们还把《东方红》录在录音带上，准备带回去教会更多的人。一个印尼籍的海员还要求我工作人员将《东方红》译成印尼文，带回家唱。他激动地说，“《东方红》巴古士（好极了）。”
          毛伯伯万岁！
    希腊籍“米特拉瓦西里奇”轮有一个七岁小女孩。这天真活泼的小女孩，十分热爱毛主席。她一天到晚用她那动听的嗓音念毛主席语录，唱毛主席语录歌，喊“毛伯伯万岁！”她已经学会了《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和许多毛主席语录歌。她还有一个精致的小盒子，里面珍藏了四十多枚从各地得到的毛主席像章。每逢见到中国叔叔，她就唱歌，跳舞，还自豪地夸耀自己的小盒子，并高声欢呼“毛伯伯好！毛伯伯万岁！”
          毛主席永远和我们在一起
    一天，我工作人员参观了英籍“洛克灵顿”轮水手长的房间并和他亲切地交谈。在这个仅几平方米的小房间的四壁，都贴着一张毛主席像，表达了他对世界人民的革命领袖毛主席的无限敬仰。我边防检查员激动地问他为什么贴四幅毛主席像时，他激动地说：毛主席日日夜夜和我们在一起啊！毛主席的光辉照亮了我们前进的道路。后来，我工作人员还发现他有一至四卷英文版的《毛泽东选集》。他十分用功地学习，用心做笔记，很多地方还画上了红线和着重号。他对我工作人员说，毛主席的书是雾海中的灯塔，干革命离不开毛泽东思想。我从毛泽东的著作中，吸取了革命的力量。
