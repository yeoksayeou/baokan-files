In the face of strong protests from the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Japan, Japanese friends, and the Chinese Red East Circus Troupe, the Japanese reactionary authorities were forced to release, on December 15th in the afternoon, under the pretext of "suspended sentence," the staff member of the Tokyo Chinese General Association, Chen Xuequan.

　　在广大旅日华侨、日本朋友和我东方红杂技团强烈抗议下
    佐藤政府被迫释放华侨总会工作人员
    新华社东京十七日电　在广大旅日华侨、日本朋友和中国东方红杂技团的强烈抗议下，日本反动当局被迫于十二月十五日下午在所谓“保留处分”的名义下，释放了东京华侨总会工作人员陈学全。
    陈学全是在日本反动当局和宫本修正主义集团勾结在一起进行猖狂的反华活动中，于十二月四日被日本警察非法绑架到北海道的。日本警察当局把他强行关押了十多天。
    陈学全于十六日下午在东京华侨总会副会长吴普文的陪同下，由北海道飞抵东京羽田机场，受到日中友好协会（正统）总部理事长宫崎世民、事务局长三好一等日本朋友以及爱国华侨的热烈欢迎和亲切的慰问。
    廖承志办事处驻东京联络事务所代表吴曙东和东京华侨总会副会长陈焜旺也到机场迎接，并对陈学全进行了亲切慰问。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部和东京华侨总会在机场举行了欢迎会。宫崎世民、三好一和陈焜旺等在欢迎会上严厉地谴责了日本反动当局同宫本修正主义集团狼狈为奸，蓄意制造严重的反华政治事件，迫害东京华侨总会工作人员陈学全的罪行。
    他们热情地赞扬陈学全在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，不屈不挠地进行正义斗争的革命精神。陈学全在会上表示感谢各方面对他的声援和支持。他表示，要继续斗争，坚决粉碎日本反动政府迫害旅日华侨的罪恶行径。
