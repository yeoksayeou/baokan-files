The two revolutionary mass organizations at the First Automobile Factory in Changchun, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, jointly held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Focusing on "criticizing selfishness and revisionism," they started with class education, thoroughly criticized the bourgeois worldview, and established the proletarian worldview. This has achieved good results in promoting the revolutionary transformation of the thoughts of all workers in the factory and achieving revolutionary unity.

The Mao Zedong Thought study class at the First Automobile Factory in Changchun was held at a time when the two major revolutionary mass organizations in Changchun had not yet achieved revolutionary unity. Members of the two revolutionary mass organizations participating in the study class repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," and the brilliant works "Old Three Articles," using the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to fiercely criticize and struggle against the "selfish" tendencies, gradually eliminating the opposing sentiments. Some leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations, when exposing their selfish thoughts, said: After achieving victory in the power struggle, their positions changed, selfishness increased, factionalism grew, always wanting to "put oneself first," unwilling to unite, and even wanted to eliminate other revolutionary mass organizations. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they further realized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fundamentally aims to transform people's worldviews. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat cannot overcome the "selfish" tendencies and defeat the petty-bourgeois factionalism; otherwise, they cannot deeply understand Chairman Mao's great instructions, cannot thoroughly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and cannot become proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Under the impetus of the study class, the atmosphere of revolutionary unity in the entire factory became increasingly intense. Thirteen workshops and twelve departments have established preparatory committees for revolutionary unity, and more than ten sub-factories and dozens of workshops of revolutionary workers are actively preparing to implement revolutionary unity by department and workshop. In some workshops, the leaders of the two factions previously discussed unity issues for several weeks without results. Now, the revolutionary masses of the two factions quickly realized revolutionary unity by department and team.

The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams stationed in various sub-factories and workshops, along with revolutionary workers, study, discuss, criticize, and share experiences together, launching a high tide of mass revolutionary criticism and rectification within the unit. Workers say: Selfishness is the seed, revisionism is the fruit. With selfishness, one does not recognize or hate revisionism; without criticizing selfishness, revisionism cannot be thoroughly criticized. Only by winning battles on both the fronts of criticizing selfishness and revisionism can one achieve a thorough victory in anti-revisionism and prevent revisionism, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the study process, revolutionary workers also held bitter-sweet remembrance meetings, denouncing the class suffering endured in the old society, denouncing the harm caused by the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, praising the great achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao, and praising the correctness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, further deepening their limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations expressed their determination to firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fiercely criticize selfishness, and vigorously criticize revisionism, to achieve new victories in the struggles of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and promoting production while carrying out the revolution.

    长春第一汽车厂两派合办毛泽东思想学习班
    斗私批修猛促革命大联合
    据新华社长春电　长春第一汽车制造厂的两派革命群众组织，在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，从阶级教育入手，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，对促进全厂职工思想革命化和革命的大联合，取得了很好的效果。
    长春第一汽车制造厂毛泽东思想学习班，是在长春市两大派革命群众组织尚未实现革命大联合的情况下举办的。参加学习班学习的两派革命群众组织成员，经过反复学习毛主席的最新指示“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”和“老三篇”等光辉著作，用伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，狠亮狠斗“私”字，逐步消除了对立情绪。有的革命群众组织负责人在亮私心时说：取得夺权斗争的胜利以后，地位发生了变化，“私”字多了，派性大了，总想“以我为主”，不愿搞联合，还想把其他革命群众组织挤垮。学习了毛主席的最新指示，更进一步认识到，无产阶级文化大革命归根结底是改造人们世界观的伟大革命。无产阶级革命派不斗掉“私”字，不战胜小资产阶级派性，就不可能深刻理解毛主席的伟大指示，就不可能彻底执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就不可能成为决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
    在学习班的推动下，全厂革命大联合的气氛越来越浓，已经有十三个车间和十二个处室，成立了革命大联合的筹备机构，还有十多个分厂和几十个车间的革命职工，在积极筹备实行按部门、按车间的革命大联合。有的车间，以前两派头头商谈联合问题，几个星期都没有结果，现在两派革命群众一串连，迅速实现了按部门、按班组的革命大联合。
    驻各分厂和车间的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和革命职工同学习、同讨论、同批判、同讲用，掀起群众性的革命大批判和本单位斗批改的高潮。工人们说：私是种子，修是果子。有私，就不识修，不恨修；批修不斗私，修正主义就批不深、批不臭。只有在斗私批修两个战场上都打胜仗，才能取得反修、防修的彻底胜利，才能取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。革命职工在学习过程中，还通过忆苦思甜会，控诉在旧社会受到的阶级苦，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线之害，颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩，颂扬毛主席无产阶级革命路线的英明正确，进一步加深对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。一些革命群众组织负责人表示要坚决紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠斗私，猛批修，在革命大批判、革命大联合、革命三结合和抓革命促生产的斗争中立新功。
