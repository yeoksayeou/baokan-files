	Heroic Albania, a shining beacon of socialism in Europe.
		— Mao Zedong

	The great beacon of socialism in Europe shines brightly.
	Albania's people advance bravely under the great red banner of revolutionization.

	Over the past year, the revolutionization movement has deepened, significantly raising the political and ideological consciousness of the masses. Farmers in the mountainous regions have fully realized cooperation. The production fronts of industry and agriculture have reported continuous victories. Industrial output is expected to increase by 11% compared to last year, and agricultural output is expected to increase by 12%. Amateur cultural activities among workers, peasants, and soldiers have become unprecedentedly lively, with guns and hoes taking the stage.

	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 24th: Our correspondent reports that under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor, the heroic Albanian people have, over the past year, held high the great red banner of the revolutionization movement and achieved tremendous successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	In 1967, under the guidance of the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, the revolutionization movement in Albania has further deepened. On February 6th of this year, Comrade Enver Hoxha delivered a programmatic speech on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the State Power." On April 29th, the Central Committee of the Party of Labor and the Council of Ministers of Albania issued a proclamation on further deepening the revolutionization movement, pushing the vast and magnificent revolutionization movement to a new high.

	With the heroic spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, the Albanian people have, in 1967, continued to deeply carry out the struggle against bureaucracy. Various localities have resolutely implemented the decisions of the Central Committee of the Party and the Council of Ministers regarding the placement of cadres, cadre rotation, and cadres participating in physical labor, and have resolutely opposed the special privileges of cadres, activated party life, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. The masses in various localities have also thoroughly smashed various non-proletarian ideologies.

	This year, the Albanian people have launched a vigorous mass movement to eliminate religious superstitions and backward customs, and to thoroughly liberate women, establishing new socialist customs and habits among the people. The ideological consciousness of the broad masses of women has greatly improved. They have broken free from the shackles of feudal ideology, bourgeois ideology, and old customs, and actively participated in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Many women have been elected by the masses to various leadership positions.

	Over the past year, in the revolutionization movement, the broad masses of workers have firmly established the new idea of putting collective interests above personal interests. Workers in industrial and mining enterprises have voluntarily given up approximately 100 types of bonuses, allowances, and additional remuneration outside of basic wages. Farmers across the country have also reduced their private plots by 50% to 65% and reduced their private livestock by half, demonstrating a high level of socialist consciousness.

	In the first half of this year, farmers in mountainous areas who had not yet joined agricultural cooperatives all joined the cooperative path in less than three months. Over the past year, a movement to support agriculture with industry, cities with countryside, and plains with mountains has been widely carried out across the country. During the busy agricultural season alone, 150,000 workers have gone to the countryside to participate in labor, completing 850,000 workdays. Tens of thousands of young volunteers have gone to the countryside to participate in production labor for one to three years, and some have settled permanently in the countryside, determined to temper themselves in class struggle and production struggle.

	In the revolutionization movement, the Albanian people have smashed the decadent culture of the exploiting classes, established a new proletarian culture, emphasized strengthening class education and political education, and advocated for guns and hoes to take the stage in the arts. Over the past year, amateur cultural activities among workers, peasants, and soldiers have been unprecedentedly lively. More than 400 cultural houses and 1,300 cultural stations across the country have formed a powerful mass cultural force. They actively propagate the party's policies, sing the praises of the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, sing the praises of socialist heroes, and smash bourgeois ideology, feudal superstitions, and backward customs. Their performances have deep revolutionary content and strong fighting spirit, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking and inspiring the people to fight more bravely for the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	Various professional theater troupes and cultural workers in Albania have followed Comrade Hoxha's teachings that "literature and art should become powerful weapons for the party to educate workers with socialist and communist spirits." They have gone deep into factories and villages to create works and have performed many revolutionary modern plays and operas for workers, cooperative members, and border guards.

	Over the past year, the broad masses of teachers and students in Albanian schools have also achieved new successes in implementing the party's directives to link schools with life, teaching with production, and theory with practice. They have strengthened class struggle education, activated the political atmosphere in schools, and strengthened students' labor training, making contributions to the active cultivation of a new generation.

	The revolutionization movement has powerfully promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking. The people across the country have taken the party's battle cry of "thinking, working, and living like a revolutionary" as their guiding principle. Revolutionary heroes who love the party and socialism and selflessly devote themselves to the public have emerged on all fronts. Heroes like Adam Reka, a crane operator who sacrificed his life to protect state property, Muho Hizhu and Muho Kepi, petroleum engineers who sacrificed their lives to rescue an oil station from a fire, and Shyhreta Vata, a 15-year-old female hero who sacrificed her youth to build a railway early, and Vangjel Cera, a blind man who worked tirelessly for the collectivization of mountainous areas, have spread their heroic deeds and exemplary actions across the country. Tens of thousands of workers, cooperative members, soldiers, cadres, and young students have learned from the heroes' lofty communist spirit through their actions.

	The powerful revolutionization movement has promoted the rapid development of Albania's socialist construction. The broad masses of workers have adhered to the battle cry of "self-reliance, one hand with a hoe, one hand with a gun, building socialism." In 1967, they have achieved tremendous successes in various production sectors.

	On the eve of the New Year, the production front has reported continuous victories. This year's industrial output is expected to increase by 11% compared to last year. By the end of November, the mechanical industry, building materials industry, and chemical industry departments such as nitrogen fertilizer and soda have all completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule and exceeded them. Oil workers have completed the oil production plan by 4.2%. Chromium miners have completed the mining plan by 4.3%. Textile workers have produced an additional 120 million meters of cotton cloth and 191,000 meters of woolen products for the state.

	Currently, many industrial and mining enterprises have begun to execute the 1968 production tasks. The construction sites across the country are even more bustling with construction. Especially on the construction sites of the large-scale Vodej Water Power Station and the Logjcën-Fieri Railway, due to the launch of technical innovation and rationalization suggestion movements, the engineering progress has been greatly accelerated.

	This year, Albania's agricultural production has also reached a very high level, with the agricultural output value expected to increase by 12% compared to last year. The state's procurement plans for grain, sugar beets, tobacco, sunflowers, olives, dairy products, and eggs have all been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. The average yield per unit area of wheat this year has reached the highest level in Albania's history. Due to the broad masses of farmers' revolutionary enthusiasm and their enthusiastic response to the party's call for grain self-sufficiency, some regions that were previously unable to be self-sufficient in grain have begun to be self-sufficient this year, and many agricultural cooperatives have even striven to sell surplus grain and other agricultural and livestock products to the state. In the first nine months of this year alone, the agricultural laborers across the country have provided the state with 13.6% more meat, 18.5% more dairy products, and 32% more fruits compared to the same period last year.

	The basic construction tasks of agricultural water conservancy for the 1966-1967 fiscal year have also been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. The broad masses of farmers have built 117,500 hectares of terraced fields and 184 large and small water conservancy projects, thus increasing the arable land area of the country by 7% compared to 1965 and the irrigated area of farmland by 6% compared to 1966.

	The heroic Albanian people, who have achieved brilliant victories in revolution and construction in 1967, are confidently welcoming the new battles of the third year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

	Albania, the great beacon of socialism in Europe, will shine even more brightly in the new year. (Accompanied by a photograph)

	The Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania recently passed a decision to achieve the electrification of the countryside nationwide by November 8, 1971, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the party. The Albanian people have enthusiastically responded to the party's call and are determined to gloriously complete this great historical task.

    英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。				毛泽东
    欧洲伟大的社会主义明灯放射出灿烂光芒
    阿尔巴尼亚人民高举革命化伟大红旗奋勇前进
    一年来革命化运动进一步深入开展，人民群众政治思想觉悟大大提高；山区农民全部实现合作化；工农业生产战线频传捷报，工业总产值预计将比去年增长百分之十一，农业总产值预计将比去年增长百分之十二；工农兵业余文艺活动空前活跃，枪和镐走上文艺舞台。
    新华社地拉那二十四日电　本社记者报道：英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，一年来高举革命化运动的伟大红旗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得巨大成就。
    一九六七年，阿尔巴尼亚的革命化运动在劳动党第五次代表大会决议的光辉照耀下，进一步深入开展。今年的二月六日，恩维尔·霍查同志作了关于《党和政权的进一步革命化》的纲领性的讲话，四月二十九日，劳动党中央和阿尔巴尼亚部长会议又发表了关于进一步深入开展革命化运动的公告，把波澜壮阔的革命化运动推向一个新的高潮。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民以敢于斗争，敢于胜利的英雄气概，在一九六七年内继续深入开展了反对官僚主义的斗争。各地坚决贯彻劳动党中央和部长会议关于干部下放、干部轮换和干部参加体力劳动的制度，并坚决反对干部的特殊化，活跃党的生活，开展批评与自我批评。各地劳动人民还大破形形色色的非无产阶级思想。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚人民轰轰烈烈地开展了破除宗教迷信、落后习俗，彻底解放妇女的群众运动，在人民群众中树立了社会主义的新风尚、新习惯。广大妇女的思想觉悟大大地提高了，她们摆脱了封建思想、资产阶级思想和旧习俗的束缚，积极投身到社会主义革命和社会主义建设中去。不少妇女被广大群众推选到各级领导部门担任领导工作。
    一年来，在革命化运动中，广大劳动人民大树把集体利益放在个人利益之上的新思想。工矿企业的职工自愿放弃了大约一百种奖金、补助津贴和基本工资以外的额外报酬。全国农民还普遍把自留地减少百分之五十到六十五，把自留牲畜减少了一半，表现了高度的社会主义觉悟。
    今年上半年，尚未参加农业合作社的山区农民，在不到三个月的时间内就全部走上了合作化的道路。一年来，一个工业支援农业、城市支援农村、平原支援山区的运动在全国普遍开展。仅在农忙季节，全国就有十五万职工先后下乡参加劳动，共做了八十五万个劳动日。成千上万的青年志愿到农村参加生产劳动一至三年，有的还在农村长期安家落户，决心在阶级斗争和生产斗争中锻炼成长。
    在革命化运动中，阿尔巴尼亚人民大破剥削阶级的腐朽文化，建立无产阶级的新文化，强调加强阶级教育和政治教育，提倡枪和镐走上文艺舞台。一年来，工农兵业余文艺活动空前活跃。遍及全国城乡的四百多个文化之家和一千三百多个文化站，形成一支强大的群众性的文艺队伍，他们积极宣传党的政策，歌颂阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，歌颂社会主义英雄人物，大破资产阶级思想、封建迷信、落后习俗。他们演出的文艺节目具有深刻的革命思想内容和强烈的战斗性，促进了人的思想革命化，鼓舞人民为社会主义革命和社会主义建设更加勇敢地战斗。
    阿尔巴尼亚各个专业剧团和文艺工作者遵循霍查同志提出的“文学和艺术应该成为党以社会主义和共产主义精神教育劳动者的有力武器”的教导，深入工厂、农村，进行创作，并为工人、合作社社员和边防战士演出了不少革命现代话剧和歌剧。
    一年来，阿尔巴尼亚学校的广大师生在贯彻党的关于学校与生活、教学与生产、理论与实践相联系的指示方面，也取得了新的成就。他们加强了阶级斗争教育，活跃了学校的政治空气，并加强了学生的劳动锻炼，为积极培养新的一代作出了贡献。
    革命化运动有力地促进了人的思想革命化。全国人民把劳动党提出的“象革命者一样思考、工作和生活”的战斗口号作为自己行动的准则。各个战线上不断涌现出热爱党，热爱社会主义，舍己为公的革命英雄人物。象为保护祖国财产而英勇牺牲的起重机工人亚当·雷卡，为抢救输油站免遭火灾而光荣献身的石油工程师穆·希胡、技术员穆·凯皮，为早日建成铁路献出了年轻生命的十五岁的女英雄什·瓦塔和全心全意为山区合作化坚持劳动的盲人弗·采拉等。他们的英雄事迹和模范行动已传遍全国，成千上万的工人、农业社社员、人民军战士、干部和青年学生以实际行动学习英雄们的崇高的共产主义精神。
    气势磅礴的革命化运动促进了阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设事业的迅速发展。广大劳动人民坚持“自力更生，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，建设社会主义”的战斗口号，一九六七年在各个生产部门取得了巨大的成就。
    新年前夕，生产战线上捷报频传。今年的工业总产值预计将比去年增长百分之十一。到十一月底，机械工业、建筑材料工业和氮肥、制碱等化学工业部门都已提前超额完成了全年生产计划。石油工人超额百分之四点二完成了原油的生产计划。铬矿工人超额百分之四点三完成了开采计划。纺织工人为国家多生产了一百二十万米的棉布和十九万一千米的毛织品。
    目前，很多工矿企业已开始执行一九六八年的生产任务。全国建筑工地上，更是一片热气腾腾的建设景象。特别在规模巨大的沃德耶水电站和洛格齐恩—费里铁路建设工地上，由于开展了技术革新和合理化建议运动，大大加快了工程进度。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产也达到了很高的水平，农业总产值预计将比去年增长百分之十二。国家收购粮食、甜菜、烟叶、向日葵、油橄榄和奶品、蛋类的计划都超额完成。
    今年全国小麦的平均单位面积产量达到了阿尔巴尼亚历史上最高的水平。由于广大农民发挥革命干劲，热情响应劳动党提出的粮食自给的号召，有些过去粮食不能自给的地区今年也开始能自给自足了，不少农业合作社还争取多向国家交售余粮和其他农畜产品。单在今年头九个月，全国农业劳动者向国家提供的肉类就比去年同期增长百分之十三点六，奶类——百分之十八点五，水果——百分之三十二。
    一九六六——一九六七年度的农田水利基本建设任务也提前超额完成。广大农民建成梯田十一万七千五百多公顷，大小水利工程一百八十四项，从而使全国耕地面积比一九六五年扩大了百分之七，农田灌溉面积比一九六六年增加了百分之六。
    一九六七年在革命和建设中都取得了辉煌胜利的英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，正满怀信心地迎接第四个五年计划第三年的新的战斗。
    阿尔巴尼亚——欧洲的伟大的社会主义的明灯，在新的一年里将放射出更加灿烂的光芒。（附图片）
