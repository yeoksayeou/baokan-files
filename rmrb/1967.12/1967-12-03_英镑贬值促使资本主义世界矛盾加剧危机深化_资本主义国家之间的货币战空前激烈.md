The devaluation of the pound has triggered an unprecedented currency war among capitalist countries, significantly weakening the dollar, a tool used by U.S. imperialism to exploit other nations. Currently, the entire capitalist monetary system, which uses the dollar and pound as "international reserve currencies," is in chaos.

In the first week after the pound's devaluation, a wave of dollar selling and gold buying swept through London and other financial centers in Western Europe, directly challenging the dollar. During this week, the amount of gold purchased on the London gold market alone reached 500 tons (equivalent to over $600 million), an unprecedented figure. This has made the already fragile position of the dollar even more precarious.

The dollar's weakness lies in the fact that while demand for gold in the European market continues to rise, the United States' "first-line" gold reserves that can be immediately mobilized are only around $3 billion. Additionally, there is $10 billion worth of gold frozen as domestic dollar backing. The Guardian reported that if the demand for gold continues at last week's rate, "the U.S.'s total gold reserves of $13 billion will be completely depleted in a little over three months." The dollar's weakness also lies in the fact that other countries hold over $300 billion in dollars that can be exchanged for gold at any time, which is more than double the U.S.'s total gold reserves.

For years, the United States has been using dollar exports as a means to shift its international trade deficits to other countries. In the past 17 years, the U.S. has had a trade deficit for 16 of those years. From 1960 to 1966 alone, the cumulative total of the U.S.'s trade deficits reached nearly $1.97 billion. The costs of the Vietnam War have further exacerbated the U.S.'s trade deficit. However, under the current capitalist monetary system, the dollar is directly linked to gold and, like gold, serves as a reserve for capitalist countries. Therefore, the U.S. can use the dollar's privileged status to offset its trade deficits with dollars rather than gold. This has led to an excess of dollars in the capitalist world and has caused inflation in many Western countries.

The U.S.'s self-serving practices have met with increasing resistance from other Western countries, particularly France. The de Gaulle government has taken numerous measures to undermine the dollar's privileged status as an "international reserve currency" under the current capitalist monetary system. France has already demanded that the price of gold be doubled, from $35 per ounce to $70, which effectively means devaluing the dollar.

While the pound's devaluation has put significant pressure on the dollar, the pound's position remains very weak. This is because: first, Britain is still heavily in debt. It is estimated that Britain's short-term and medium-term debts currently total $7-8 billion, more than double Britain's total gold and foreign exchange reserves (approximately $3 billion). Just paying the interest on these debts costs Britain a significant amount of money each year. Second, the benefits that the Labour government hopes to gain from exports will be somewhat offset by the rise in import prices. Although the pound's devaluation has lowered the price of British goods in foreign markets, Britain imports half of its food and 80-90% of its raw materials from abroad, and the price of these imports will rise due to the pound's devaluation, making the cost of British goods even higher. Third, the pound's devaluation will accelerate the disintegration of the pound zone, further shrinking Britain's traditional export markets. At the same time, the pound's devaluation will intensify export competition among capitalist countries, and the instability of the pound and dollar will make the prospect of expanding trade among capitalist countries very bleak. Fourth, the austerity measures taken simultaneously with the pound's devaluation will have a negative impact on Britain's economy, further weakening Britain's competitiveness against other countries.

All these facts indicate that the pound's devaluation has far from resolved the pound crisis; instead, it has intensified contradictions in the financial and economic spheres of the capitalist world and deepened the crisis. The frenzied gold-buying spree that followed the pound's devaluation is a harbinger of these intensified contradictions and deepening crisis.

### 英镑贬值促使资本主义世界矛盾加剧危机深化  资本主义国家之间的货币战空前激烈

    英镑贬值促使资本主义世界矛盾加剧危机深化
    资本主义国家之间的货币战空前激烈
    据新华社伦敦电　英镑贬值触发了资本主义国家之间一场空前激烈的货币战，使美帝国主义用来剥削其他国家的手段的美元遭到很大削弱。目前，以美元和英镑作为“国际储备货币”的整个资本主义货币体系，呈现出一片混乱。
    英镑贬值后的第一周，在伦敦及西欧其他金融中心发生的抛售美元、抢购黄金的风潮，是对美元的正面冲击。在这一周中，仅在伦敦黄金市场上抢购的黄金，就达到五百吨（相当于六亿多美元），这是前所未有的。这就使本来就相当虚弱的美元地位变得更加危险。
    美元的脆弱性在于，当西欧市场对黄金的需求不断增长的时候，事实上，美国可供随时调用的“第一线”黄金储备却只有三十亿美元左右。另外还有总值一百亿美元的黄金作为国内美元的法定后备，是被冻结的。《卫报》说，假如对黄金的需求仍按上周的规模继续下去，“美国的全部黄金储备一百三十亿美元就会在三个月多一点的时间内完全耗光。”美元的脆弱性还在于，其他国家所持有的可以随时兑换黄金的美元，现在已经超过三百亿美元——比美国的黄金储备总和多出一倍以上。
    这些年来，美国一直在利用输出美元作为向其他国家转嫁它的国际收支赤字的手段。美国在过去十七年中有十六年都出现国际收支的赤字。仅仅从一九六○年到一九六六年当中，美国国际收支赤字的累积总和就达到将近一百九十七亿美元。侵越战争的开支使美国的国际收支逆差状况更加恶化。但是根据现行的资本主义货币制度，美元同黄金直接挂钩，并和黄金一样，成为资本主义各国的储备手段，因此美国可以利用美元的这种特权地位，用美元而不是用黄金来抵偿它的国际收支赤字。这样就在资本主义世界造成了美元过剩，并在许多西方国家引起了通货膨胀。
    美国这种损人利己的做法遭到了其他西方国家，特别是法国的日益强烈的抵抗。戴高乐政府采取许多措施，极力动摇美元在现行资本主义货币制度下作为“国际储备货币”的特权地位。法国已经要求把黄金价格提高一倍，即由每盎司三十五美元提高到七十美元，这也就是意味着要美元贬值。
    在英镑贬值使美元受到沉重压力的同时，英镑的地位依然十分软弱。这是因为：第一，英国仍然债台高筑。据估计，目前英国的短期债务和中期债务达七、八十亿美元，等于英国黄金外汇储备总额（大约三十亿美元）的一倍以上。光是支付这些债务的利息，英国每年就要花一大笔钱。第二，工党政府所希望的在出口方面得到的好处，将在某种程度上被进口货价格上涨所抵销。因为，英镑贬值虽然使英国货在国外市场上价格下降，但是英国所需的粮食有一半、原料有百分之八、九十都是从国外进口的，而进口的东西将因英镑贬值而价格上升，这就决定英国货的成本更高了。第三，英镑贬值将使英镑区加速分裂，使英国的传统出口市场进一步缩小。同时英镑贬值还将促使资本主义国家之间的出口竞争加剧，而英镑和美元的不稳定，又会使资本主义国家之间扩大贸易的前景变得非常阴暗。第四，在英镑贬值同时采取的通货紧缩措施，将对英国经济产生不利的影响，进一步削弱英国对其他国家的竞争力。
    所有这些事实说明，英镑贬值远远没有解决英镑危机，反而促使资本主义世界财政经济领域里的矛盾激化，危机深化。英镑贬值后狂热抢购黄金的风潮，就是这种矛盾激化、危机深化的先兆。
