Tokyo, December 22 (New China News Agency) - According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, Chairman Sakamoto Tokumatsu of the Japan Committee for Asia-Africa Solidarity and renowned commentator Matsuoka Yōko separately spoke to reporters from the Oriental News Agency, pointing out that the telegram sent by the great leader Chairman Mao to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, holds great historical significance. This not only provides immense encouragement to the Vietnamese people but also greatly inspires people all over the world.

Sakamoto Tokumatsu said, “Chairman Mao’s telegram is the greatest joy for all the people of the world.”

Sakamoto said, “The great helmsman of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, teaches us: ‘Rely firmly on the people, wage a people’s war, and any powerful enemy can be defeated.’ Chairman Mao also teaches that the anti-American national salvation war waged by the Vietnamese people ‘sets a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world to achieve liberation.’ We, the Japanese people, must follow Chairman Mao’s teachings, firmly hold high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and take the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide for all actions and struggles.”

Sakamoto said that the recent reactionary Sato government in Japan has been intensifying its efforts to sabotage the struggle of the Japanese people for independence, peace, and democracy, illegally arresting Japanese revolutionaries, and viciously persecuting patriotic overseas Chinese in Japan. However, as Chairman Mao pointed out in the telegram, as long as we persist in struggle, we will achieve victory.

Matsuoka Yōko said, “Chairman Mao’s telegram most clearly and profoundly analyzes the current situation in Vietnam and correctly points out the future of the Vietnamese people’s struggle.”

Matsuoka said that Chairman Mao pointed out, “The days of the American aggressors in Vietnam are numbered.” This has brought great joy to the Vietnamese people and people all over the world.

Matsuoka said that Chairman Mao once again expressed that the 700 million people of China are the staunch supporters of the Vietnamese people, which has great significance. This deals a decisive blow to the conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists who pin their last hopes on military adventures and political deception.

Matsuoka finally said that Chairman Mao pointed out, “Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people’s war, any powerful enemy can be defeated.” This wise judgment has universal significance. Revolutionary people of all countries must seriously study and implement this directive.

    日本朋友热烈欢呼毛主席贺电具有重大历史意义
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想是行动的指南
    日本人民要遵循毛主席教导把反帝反修斗争进行到底
    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：据东方通讯社报道，亚非人民团结日本委员会理事长坂本德松和著名评论家松冈洋子分别向东方通讯社记者发表谈话指出，伟大领袖毛主席给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿的贺电，具有重大的历史意义。这不仅给越南人民以无限的鼓励，同时，对全世界人民也是莫大鼓舞。
    坂本德松说：“毛主席的贺电是全世界人民的最大喜事。”
    坂本说：“世界人民的伟大舵手毛主席教导我们：‘坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。’毛主席还教导说，越南人民进行的抗美救国战争，‘为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。’我们日本人民必须遵循毛主席的教导，高举反帝、反修的鲜明旗帜，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为我们一切行动的指南而进行斗争。”
    坂本说，日本佐藤反动政府最近不断地加紧破坏日本人民争取独立、和平和民主的斗争，非法逮捕日本革命者，并且对旅日爱国华侨进行疯狂的迫害。但是，正如毛主席在贺电中指出的那样，只要我们坚持斗争，就能取得胜利。
    松冈洋子说：“毛主席的贺电，最明确、最深刻地分析了现在的越南形势，并且最正确地指出了越南人民斗争的前途。”
    松冈说，毛主席指出：“美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。”这使越南人民和全世界人民欢欣鼓舞。
    松冈说：毛主席再次表示中国七亿人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，有着重大的意义。这给美帝、苏修把最后希望寄托于进行军事冒险和政治欺骗的阴谋以决定性的打击。
    松冈最后说，毛主席指出：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”这个英明论断具有普遍的意义。一切国家的革命人民都必须认真学习和执行这个指示。
