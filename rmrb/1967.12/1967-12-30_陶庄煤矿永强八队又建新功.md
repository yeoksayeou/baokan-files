The Yongqiang Brigade of Taozhuang Coal Mine, a nationally renowned advanced collective in the coal industry, has once again built new achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have completed their annual national production task 27 days ahead of schedule, becoming the "locomotive" for the entire mining area in the struggle to seize revolution and promote production.

The Yongqiang Brigade is a specialized team for excavating large tunnels. The 96 revolutionary workers in the brigade have been following the great leader Chairman Mao with unwavering loyalty, consistently adhering to the principle of making revolution above ground and producing below ground. Over the past year, not a single person in the brigade has slackened their efforts. While engaging in a head-on struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they have also redoubled their efforts, overcome various difficulties, and striven to produce. The excavation progress has been completed in excess of the plan every day, with quality continuously improving. From January to July this year, the total excavation progress completed 101.26% of the national plan. Since August, the daily excavation progress has increased by an additional 12.5% compared to before.

    陶庄煤矿永强八队又建新功
    煤炭工业战线上全国著名的先进集体——山东枣庄矿务局陶庄煤矿永强八队的革命工人，在无产阶级文化大革命中又建立了新的功劳：提前二十七天完成了全年国家生产任务，成为全矿区抓革命、促生产的“火车头”。
    永强八队是一个专门开拓大巷道的掘进队。全队革命工人赤胆忠心紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，始终坚持井上闹革命，井下搞生产。一年来，全队九十六人没有一个松劲的。他们一面同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作针锋相对的斗争，一面鼓足干劲，克服各种困难，努力生产，掘进进尺日日超额完成，质量不断提高。今年一至七月份掘进总进尺完成国家计划的百分之一百零一点二六。八月份以后，每日掘进进尺又比以前提高了百分之十二点五。
