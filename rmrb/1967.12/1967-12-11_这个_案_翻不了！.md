This "Case" Cannot Be Overturned!

Upon taking power, Khrushchev immediately launched a massive attack on Stalin, denouncing the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the guise of opposing "cult of personality," and under the banner of "people are brothers and friends," he openly rehabilitated counter-revolutionaries, traitors, and ghosts and monsters, gathering a counter-revolutionary force to restore capitalism.

Following closely behind Khrushchev, the literary and artistic circles of the Soviet revisionists also launched a "rehabilitation" craze. They restored the reputations of reactionary writers and poets who had been criticized during the Stalin era, placing them in important positions, sending them on visits to Western countries, and publishing and distributing their reactionary works in large quantities.

In this "rehabilitation" campaign, Ilya Ehrenburg, who was hailed by the West as the leader of the "thaw" literature, was a prominent figure. In his memoirs, "Man, Years, Life," he wrote extensively about "rehabilitation," erecting monuments and biographies for reactionary writers and poets, and elevating Pasternak, Tsvetaeva, Yesenin, and Babel to the highest heavens!

Who is Pasternak? He is the infamous author of the reactionary novel "Doctor Zhivago." As soon as this poisonous weed was released, it was severely criticized and firmly rejected by the revolutionary masses of the Soviet Union, and its publication was refused. On October 23, 1958, when the Swedish Academy decided to award the Nobel Prize in Literature, which was left to Western writers and Eastern traitors, to Pasternak, the broad revolutionary people of the Soviet Union were indignant and unanimously condemned Pasternak, the traitor. Angry crowds demonstrated around his residence for a week. Such a thoroughly reactionary and stinking writer was praised by Ehrenburg as "the best lyric poet of our time," claiming that "his poems will never be erased from the world"; his reactionary novel "Doctor Zhivago" "does not harm our country at all." Ehrenburg's blatant reversal of right and wrong is utterly shameful!

Who is Tsvetaeva? It's a big joke! This female poet, who was praised by Ehrenburg as having "high talent" and whose "poems are engraved in my memory and will never fade," never published any works during her lifetime, and her name was rarely known to people. She wrote some poems. These poems, apart from sympathizing with the Tsar and praising the White Guards, were erotic, sentimental, and decadent. Such reactionary poems were naturally not allowed to be published in socialist Soviet Union at that time. Tsvetaeva was extremely hostile to the October Revolution. After the October Revolution, she fled to a foreign country and committed suicide upon her return, thus showing her irreconcilable hostility towards the Soviet regime. Such an extremely reactionary female "poet" was praised by Ehrenburg. The Soviet Writers' Union even established a special committee to collect her letters, photographs, manuscripts, and other related materials from her lifetime, publishing and distributing them in large quantities. Tsvetaeva herself would never have dreamed that more than twenty years after her death, she would become a famous female "poet." The world is truly full of wonders!

Ehrenburg also praised Yesenin, who was hostile to the Soviet regime and committed suicide, as a poet who was "loved by the people," "sincere," and made people "fall in love with him"; he praised Babel, who cursed the October Revolution, slandered the Red Army, and lived in Paris for a long time before being arrested upon his return, as the "most welcome writer in the world," and a person who was "loyal to justice, internationalism, and humanitarian ideals until his death"...

Birds of a feather flock together. Ehrenburg's praise for reactionary writers and the erection of monuments for them, singing praises for them, precisely exposed his own reactionary face, proving that they are of the same ilk!

The history of the Soviet Union proves: revisionists, when they want to stage a counter-revolutionary restoration, often use the "rehabilitation" craze as a detonator and breakthrough point. By doing so, they can achieve two goals: politically, they can slander the dictatorship of the proletariat; organizationally, they can recruit a batch of counter-revolutionary cadres. They not only rehabilitate the living but also rehabilitate the dead. The purpose of rehabilitating the dead is to use the spirits of the deceased and the stench from the coffins to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and serve their revisionist political line.

In today's Soviet Union, although the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has already rehabilitated those reactionary figures, this "case" will never be overturned in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union! One day, the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will definitely raise high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and overturn the "case" that has been overturned by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique!

### 这个“案”翻不了！

　　这个“案”翻不了！
　　吴学江
    赫鲁晓夫一上台，就大反斯大林，攻击无产阶级专政。他在反对“个人迷信”的幌子下，在“人与人是兄弟和朋友”的旗号下，公开地为反革命、叛徒、牛鬼蛇神“翻案”，为他复辟资本主义拼凑反革命队伍。
    紧跟在赫鲁晓夫的屁股后面，苏修文艺界也大刮“翻案”风，为在斯大林时期受过批判的反动作家、诗人“恢复名誉”，把他们安插在重要的职位上，让他们到西方各国访问，大量出版、发行他们的反动著作。
    在这场“翻案”活动中，被西方誉为“解冻”文学带头人的爱伦堡，是一个急先锋。他在回忆录《人·岁月·生活》一书中，大做“翻案”文章，为反动的作家、诗人树碑立传，把帕斯捷尔纳克、茨维塔耶娃、叶赛宁、巴别尔之流捧到九天之上！
    帕斯捷尔纳克何许人也？就是臭名昭著的反动小说《日瓦戈医生》的作者。《日瓦戈医生》这株大毒草一出笼，就受到苏联革命群众的严厉批判，坚决拒绝出版。一九五八年十月二十三日，当瑞典文学院决定把“留给西方作家和东方叛徒”的诺贝尔文学奖金授与帕斯捷尔纳克时，苏联广大的革命人民群众义愤填膺，同声谴责帕斯捷尔纳克这个叛徒，愤怒的人群在他的住宅周围示威游行了一个星期。就是这样一个反动透顶、臭不可闻的作家，爱伦堡却把他誉为“当代最优秀的抒情诗人”，胡说“他的诗不会从世界上被清除出去的”；他的反动小说《日瓦戈医生》“绝无损害我国之意”。爱伦堡如此明目张胆地颠倒黑白，真是可耻已极！
    茨维塔耶娃又是何许人？说起来是个大笑话！这位被爱伦堡吹捧为“具有高度的才能”，“她的诗已经铭刻在我的记忆之中，终生不会磨灭”的女诗人，在她生前从未发表过作品，连她的名字也很少为人们所知道。她是写过一些诗的。这些诗，除了同情沙皇，歌颂白匪之外，就是色情、伤感、颓废。这样反动的诗作，在当时社会主义的苏联不让出版，是理所当然的。茨维塔耶娃十分仇视十月革命。十月革命以后她逃到了外国，回国后又自杀身死，以此表示她与苏维埃政权势不两立。就是这样一个极端反动的女“诗人”，却得到了爱伦堡的称赞。苏修作协还成立了一个专门委员会，收集她生前的书信、照片、手稿以及其他有关材料，大量出版发行。茨维塔耶娃本人在生前作梦也不会想到，她死后二十多年竟然成了赫赫有名的女“诗人”。天下真是无奇不有！
    爱伦堡还把同苏维埃政权不共戴天而自杀的“颓废派”诗人叶赛宁称誉为“受到人们爱戴”的、“真诚”的、使人“为之倾倒”的诗人；把诅咒十月革命，污蔑红军，长期侨居巴黎，回国后被捕的反革命作家巴别尔吹捧成“最受世界人民欢迎的”、“至死都忠于正义、国际主义、人道主义理想的人”……。
    物以类聚，人以群分。爱伦堡这样为反动作家树碑立传，大唱赞美诗，恰恰暴露了他自己的反动嘴脸，证明他们是一丘之貉！
    苏联的历史证明：修正主义者要搞反革命复辟，往往是把大刮“翻案”风做为爆破点和突破口的。他们这样做，可以一箭双雕：在政治上，污蔑无产阶级专政；在组织上，为他们收罗一批反革命骨干。他们不但为活人“翻案”，而且还为死人“翻案”。为死人“翻案”，目的是借助于亡灵和棺材里的臭气来攻击无产阶级专政，为他们的修正主义政治路线服务。
    在今天的苏联，尽管苏修叛徒集团已经为那些反动家伙翻了“案”，但是，这个“案”在苏联革命人民的心目中是永远也翻不了的！总有一天，苏联革命人民一定会高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，把被苏修叛徒集团翻了的“案”再翻过来！
