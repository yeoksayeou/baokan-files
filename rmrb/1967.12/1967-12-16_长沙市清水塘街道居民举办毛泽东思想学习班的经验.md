The residents of Qing Shui Tang Subdistrict in Changsha City, numbering over 18,000, have recently responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao by establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. This has promoted the revolutionary criticism, consolidated the revolutionary unity, and sparked a new wave of learning Mao Zedong Thought among the residents. Their main experiences in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes are as follows:

(1) Conducting thorough and detailed ideological work for every individual, helping the masses solve practical difficulties, and ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to study.

Among the residents of the subdistrict, there are many women and elderly people who handle household chores. Many of them were previously preoccupied with household matters and indifferent to national affairs. To mobilize these people to participate in study, it is not only necessary to conduct thorough and detailed ideological and political work but also to help them solve practical difficulties. The revolutionary committee of the subdistrict first organized the residents to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "You must pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Then, they helped some women who handle household chores in the subdistrict to arrange their household chores, take care of their children, and look after the elderly. For those who were not very enthusiastic about participating in the study classes, the revolutionary committee of the subdistrict adopted a combination of general mobilization and individual assistance, a combination of subdistrict education and worker education, and a combination of ideological education and assistance in solving specific difficulties. In this way, ideological and political work was carried out in every household and implemented for every individual. Therefore, more and more residents participated in the study. The residents reflected that in the past, Qing Shui Tang had three vices: gambling, watching operas, and strolling on the streets. Now, they have developed a passion for studying the works of Chairman Mao. Qing Shui Tang has seen a vigorous wave of studying the works of Chairman Mao.

(2) Adopting appropriate study methods based on the characteristics of the subdistrict residents.

The residents of Qing Shui Tang have the characteristics of being large in number, diverse in composition, few in cadres, few in core members, few in literate individuals, many in elderly people, many in women and children, and many in household chores.

Based on these characteristics, they adopted the methods of cultivating Mao Zedong Thought propagandists, dividing areas for responsibility, combining key points with general areas, and organizing groups separately. In terms of study content, they followed the principle of being concise and precise.

They selected comrades who care about national affairs and have a certain level of political and cultural understanding from the subdistrict factories and residents' committees to serve as Mao Zedong Thought propagandists. These propagandists were the first to study more and better, and then they guided the broad masses of residents in their studies. The masses called these propagandists "red seeds." After these propagandists went down to the grassroots, they cultivated a batch of core members, and the core members, in turn, led a group of activists among the masses. In this way, the number of activists studying the works of Chairman Mao increased. The masses said, "Qing Shui Tang has become a red pond."

Their method of organizing study groups was to combine cadres, workers from subdistrict factories, revolutionary masses, and residents. They believed that this method of organizing had the advantage of mutual understanding, mutual assistance, promotion of revolutionary criticism, promotion of revolutionary unity, and consolidation of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

In terms of study content, they followed the principle of being concise and precise. Based on the low cultural level of the residents, they studied one viewpoint and solved one problem per week. They studied a little and applied it a little. This method of study was very popular among the residents. They said, "This way of studying is time-saving, effective, and practical."

(3) The study classes consistently carried out the education of reminiscing and comparing the old and new societies and the struggle between the two lines, denouncing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie by the handful of power-hungry elements within the party, and upholding the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

Among the laboring people of the subdistrict, there are many elderly people, and almost everyone has a history of suffering. A 65-year-old man, Xie Zhenhua, said, "In the old society, my uncle was 70 years old, but he still had to beg for food with a stick. He was bitten to death by a landlord's dog while begging. Today, I am also close to 70, but my old age is so happy. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no old man like me. I hope Chairman Mao can live for ten thousand years."

A 50-year-old housewife, Liu Xianjue, had her son injured in October due to violating traffic regulations and not listening to the inspection of the sentry of the PLA garrison unit 69000. After being rescued by the 69000 unit, someone told her to demand money from the provincial revolutionary committee and the 69000 unit. After studying, she expressed that the 69000 unit is trusted by Chairman Mao, and the provincial revolutionary committee is approved by Chairman Mao. If I do so, I will be disloyal to Chairman Mao. She also said, "My son has shortcomings, and I will educate him to always listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao in the revolution."

　　长沙市清水塘街道居民举办毛泽东思想学习班的经验
    （一）将深入细致的思想工作做到每个人，帮助群众解决实际困难，让群众都能得到学习的机会。（二）根据街道居民的特点，采取了培养毛泽东思想宣传员，分片包干，点面结合，分别编组的办法，在学习内容上贯彻少而精的原则。（三）学习班始终贯彻新旧社会和两条路线斗争的回忆对比教育，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    本报讯　长沙市清水塘街道有一万八千多居民。最近，他们响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，推动了革命的大批判，巩固了革命的大联合，在居民中掀起了学习毛泽东思想的新高潮。他们举办毛泽东思想学习班的主要经验是：
    （一）将深入细致的思想工作做到每个人，帮助每个人解决实际困难，使每个人都能得到学习的机会。
    街道居民中料理家务的妇女和老人比较多，有不少人过去是埋头家务，不闻天下事的。把这些人发动起来参加学习，不仅要做深入细致的思想政治工作，而且要帮助他们解决实际困难。这个街道的革命派组织，首先组织街道居民学习毛主席关于“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，然后，又帮助一些理家的街道妇女安排好家务，带好孩子，照顾好老人。对一些参加学习班不太积极的人，这个街道的革命派组织，还采取一般动员与个别帮助相结合；街道教育与职工干部教育相结合；思想教育与帮助解决具体困难相结合的办法，这样把思想政治工作做到户，落实到人。因此，参加学习的居民越来越多。居民们反映，过去清水塘有三瘾，即：打牌、看戏、逛大街，现在变成学习毛主席著作有瘾了。清水塘出现了一个蓬蓬勃勃的学习毛主席著作的新高潮。
    （二）根据街道居民的特点，采取适当的学习方法。
    清水塘居民具有一大、一杂、三少、三多的特点。一大即：摊子大，有近两万居民，还有几十个街办副业工厂；一杂即：人员杂，其中混有一小撮坏人；三少即：干部少，骨干少，识字的人少；三多即：老人多，妇女孩子多，家务事多。
    他们根据这些特点，采取了培养毛泽东思想宣传员，分片包干，点面结合，分别编组的办法，在学习内容上贯彻少而精的原则。
    他们在街办各工厂和居委会中推选关心国家大事、有一定政治和文化水平的同志担任毛泽东思想宣传员，让这些人先学一步，多学一点，然后再辅导广大居民学习。群众管这些宣传员叫做“红色种子”。这些宣传员下去后，又培养了一批骨干，骨干又在群众中带起一批积极分子。这样，学习毛主席著作的积极分子越来越多。群众说：“清水塘变成了红水塘。”
    他们的学习编组采取干部、街办工厂工人、革命派群众和居民四结合的办法编组。他们认为这样编组的好处是，能互相了解，能互相帮助，能推动革命的大批判，能促进革命的大联合，能巩固革命的“三结合”。
    在学习内容上，贯彻少而精的原则。他们根据居民文化水平低的特点，一周学透一个观点，解决一个问题。学一点，用一点。这样的学习方法很受居民欢迎。他们说：“这样学习，时间短，收效快，用的上。”
    （三）学习班始终贯彻新旧社会和两条路线斗争的回忆对比教育，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派的资产阶级反动路线，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    街道居民的劳动人民中老人很多，差不多每人都有一段血泪史。六十五岁的老人谢振华说：“旧社会我伯伯七十岁了，手里还拿着根要饭棍，在讨饭时被地主的狗咬死了。今天我也快七十了，可我的晚年是多么幸福啊。这全亏了毛主席，没有毛主席，就没有我老汉，我就希望毛主席能活万万年。”
    五十岁的家庭妇女刘先觉，她的儿子在十月份因为违章开车不听中国人民解放军驻军六九○○部队哨兵的检查，被误伤，经六九○○部队抢救脱险后，有人叫她到省革筹小组和六九○○部队要钱。学习后她表示，六九○○部队是毛主席信任的，省革筹小组是毛主席批准的，我要这样做就对不起毛主席。并说，我儿子有缺点，我要教育他，永远听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席干革命。
