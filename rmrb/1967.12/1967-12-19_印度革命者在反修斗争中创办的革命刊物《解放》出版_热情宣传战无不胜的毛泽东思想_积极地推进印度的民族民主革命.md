Indian revolutionaries who resolutely oppose modern revisionism have overcome numerous difficulties and recently published their own revolutionary journal, "Liberation." The journal enthusiastically propagates the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and actively promotes the national democratic revolution in India. This is another victory in the Indian revolutionaries' struggle against revisionism.

"Liberation" features on its cover page a quotation from the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao: "The questions of the united front, armed struggle, and party building are the three basic questions in our party's leadership of the Chinese revolution. To correctly understand these three questions and their interrelationship is to correctly lead the entire Chinese revolution."

"Liberation" also features on its last page a quotation from Chairman Mao: "Revolutionary leadership that harms the revolution should not be accepted unconditionally but should be resolutely resisted."

The preface to the first issue of "Liberation" states: "In India, an unprecedented revolutionary situation is rapidly developing. Farmers in Naxalbari, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have raised the banner of resistance against feudal oppression and the rule of the reactionary classes. 'Naxalbari marks the beginning of a new era in Indian history—the beginning of the end of the old system of exploitation by imperialism and its parasites.'"

The preface expresses the journal's commitment to the revolutionary cause in India and its resolve to wage an uncompromising struggle against imperialists, domestic reactionaries, and all kinds of revisionists.

An article in the first issue of "Liberation" emphasizes that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary world. Anyone who opposes Mao Zedong Thought is bound to fall into the embrace of imperialism.

The article points out: "The primary task of Indian revolutionaries is to propagate and disseminate revolutionary theory, that is, to propagate and disseminate Mao Zedong Thought."

The article points out that the Indian revolution must implement Chairman Mao's theory of people's war.

The article states: "India is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country," and the only correct path for the people's democratic revolution is: "Under the leadership of the working class, through a land revolution, establish revolutionary base areas in rural regions; then expand these revolutionary base areas to encircle the cities; organize the people's liberation army from peasant guerrilla forces; and seize the cities to lead the revolution to victory."

The article concludes by stressing that the Indian revolution can only achieve victory through long-term, arduous struggle. However, the Indian revolution will definitely be victorious, and a new democratic India will be established. This new democratic India will firmly march towards socialism.

The first issue of "Liberation" also reprints in full the editorial "India's Thunder" published by the People's Daily on July 5 of this year, which praises the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India for launching armed struggles by peasants in Darjeeling County.

"Liberation" also exposes the new colonialism practiced by the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique in India and reveals the traitorous face of Indian revisionists who betray Marxism-Leninism, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and promote the revisionist line.

　　印度革命者在反修斗争中创办的革命刊物《解放》出版
　　热情宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想
　　积极地推进印度的民族民主革命
    新华社十八日讯　新德里消息：坚决反对现代修正主义的印度革命者，战胜重重困难，最近创办了自己的革命刊物——《解放》，热情地宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，积极地推进印度的民族民主革命。这是印度革命者反对修正主义的斗争的又一个胜利。
    《解放》在扉页上刊登了世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的语录：“统一战线问题，武装斗争问题，党的建设问题，是我们党在中国革命中的三个基本问题。正确地理解了这三个问题及其相互关系，就等于正确地领导了全部中国革命。”
    《解放》还在最后一页上刊登了毛主席的语录：危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。
    《解放》第一期的前言说：“在印度，一个空前的革命形势正在迅速发展。用毛泽东思想武装起来的英勇的纳萨尔巴里农民，举起了反抗封建压迫，反抗反动阶级统治的旗帜。”“纳萨尔巴里标志着印度历史新纪元的开始——帝国主义及其寄生虫的剥削旧制度结束的开始。”
    前言表示，这个刊物致力于印度的革命事业，誓同帝国主义者、本国反动派和形形色色的修正主义者进行毫不妥协的战斗。
    《解放》第一期发表的一篇文章强调说，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。谁要反对毛泽东思想谁就注定要投入帝国主义怀抱。
    文章指出：印度革命者的“首要任务是宣传和传播革命理论，即宣传和传播毛泽东思想。”
    文章指出，印度革命必须实行毛主席关于人民战争的理论。
    文章说：“印度是一个半殖民地半封建的国家”，人民民主革命的唯一正确道路是：“在工人阶级领导下，通过土地革命，在农村地区建立革命根据地；随后扩大这些革命根据地来包围城市；从农民游击队中组织人民解放军；用夺取城市来导致革命走向胜利。”
    文章最后强调说，印度的革命只有通过长期的艰苦斗争，才能取得胜利。但是印度革命一定会胜利，一个民主的新印度一定会建立起来，这个民主的新印度必将坚定地朝着社会主义迈进。
    《解放》第一期还全文转载了《人民日报》今年七月五日发表的赞扬印共革命派在大吉岭县发动农民开展武装斗争的社论《印度的春雷》。
    《解放》还揭露了苏联现代修正主义领导集团对印度实行新殖民主义，并揭露了印度修正主义分子背叛马克思列宁主义，反对毛泽东思想，推行修正主义路线的叛徒面目。
