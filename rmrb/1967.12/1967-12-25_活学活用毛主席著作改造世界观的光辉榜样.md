Under the great leadership of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the entire military and civilian population are launching a campaign to learn from the hero Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong.

Today, our newspaper publishes the outline of Comrade Li Wenzhong's thought report before his death, which fully demonstrates that Hero Li Wenzhong, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, was loyal to Chairman Mao, followed Chairman Mao closely, and was selfless and dedicated to the people. This was not accidental but the result of a solid ideological foundation. It was the result of his long-term active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, breaking private interests and establishing public interests. He thoroughly exposed, fought against, and changed the bourgeois "self," truly implementing Chairman Mao's teachings on the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice. He set a shining example for us to learn from Chairman Mao's works, to combine learning with application, to see immediate results, and to work hard on application to fundamentally transform our worldviews.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The transformation of worldviews is a fundamental transformation."

Studying Chairman Mao's works and working hard on application, among all the principles, the first is to transform worldviews. Without this transformation, nothing can be done well. As the heroes of the Fourth Platoon said: "A person full of individualism, always thinking of themselves, can read Chairman Mao's books, even memorize the words, but they will never truly act according to Mao Zedong Thought."

"The remnants of old ideas reflecting the old system always linger in people's minds and are not willing to leave easily." To eradicate the influence of the "self" that has been left over for thousands of years from the depths of the soul, it is a profound revolution. It requires a resolute and thorough spirit of self-revolution and also relies on the power of the masses. Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, in revolutionary struggles and before the masses, consciously exposing, fighting against, and changing the "self" is the fundamental way to break private interests and establish public interests. It is a basic experience of our army's broad masses of soldiers and officers who have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works over a long period, achieving ideological revolutionization.

The attitude towards exposing, fighting against, and changing the "self" is the touchstone of whether one truly wants to transform oneself or is just pretending to.

Comrade Li Wenzhong remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, grasped the fundamental issue of transforming worldviews, actively studied and applied the "Three Articles," and thoroughly exposed the "self": fearlessly revealing all, turning over every corner and exposing everything; fought strongly: "Where it hurts, strike there; where it is stubborn, attack there," not just "cutting leeks" but "pulling out radishes"; changed resolutely: "Make up one's mind, study diligently, and temper oneself repeatedly to transform oneself." Thus, at a young age, he reached the peak of the proletarian "public" and became a great communist warrior who is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and completely, thoroughly dedicated to the people.

Some people also study Chairman Mao's works and talk about transforming worldviews, but they are not willing to expose, fight against, and change the "self," or they expose hesitantly, fight half-heartedly, and change superficially. It can be said for sure that they will never be able to transform themselves.

The comrades of the hero Fourth Platoon said: "Studying Chairman Mao's works, studying a thousand times, ten thousand times, without deep proletarian feelings, is still fake studying." Whether the bourgeois "self" can be thoroughly exposed, fought against, and changed, ultimately, is a matter of class feelings.

The comrades of the hero Fourth Platoon remembered the bitterness of the old society, did not forget the blood debt, and with deep class feelings of love for Chairman Mao, studied Chairman Mao's works. They deeply hated and detested the bourgeois "self" and all actions and words that went against Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, they could, with high revolutionary awareness, firmly grasp the exposure, fighting against, and changing of the "self," discover the "self," actively attack, and repeatedly fight, not allowing it any foothold. They believed that having the "self" in the mind and not fighting against it is disloyal to Chairman Mao. This is a good education for those who are reluctant to part with the "self" and, after studying Chairman Mao's works, do not touch their souls at all.

Learning from the hero Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong is most important and fundamental. It is to, like Comrade Li Wenzhong, in class struggles, diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "fight against the self and criticize revisionism," thoroughly expose, fight against, and change the bourgeois "self," fundamentally transform worldviews, become a true proletarian revolutionary warrior who follows Chairman Mao closely, and make new contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 活学活用毛主席著作改造世界观的光辉榜样

    活学活用毛主席著作改造世界观的光辉榜样
    在伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席号召下，全国军民正在掀起一个学习英雄四排和李文忠同志的热潮。
    今天本报发表的李文忠同志生前思想汇报提纲充分表明，英雄李文忠同志，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离，毫不利己，专门利人，表现出无产阶级大公的崇高品质，决不是偶然的，是有坚实的思想基础的。这是他长期以来，带着深厚的无产阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公的结果。他对资产阶级的“私”字，彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改，真正贯彻了毛主席教导的理论联系实际的革命好学风，为我们树立了学习毛主席著作，学用结合，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫，彻底改造世界观的光辉榜样。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。
    学习毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，千条万条，用来改造世界观是第一条。没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的。正如英雄四排同志所说：“一个满脑子个人主义，处处为个人打算的人，他们可以念毛主席的书，甚至可以背诵其中的词句，但是他们决不可能真正按照毛泽东思想办事。”
      “反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的。”从灵魂深处去掉几千年来遗留下来的“私”字的影响，是一场深刻的革命，要有坚决彻底的自我革命精神，也要依靠群众的力量。以毛泽东思想为武器，在革命斗争中，在群众面前，自觉地对“私”字进行亮、斗、改，是破私立公的根本途径，是长期以来我军广大指战员活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化的一条基本经验。
    对亮、斗、改采取什么态度，是真想改造自己还是假想改造自己的试金石。
    李文忠同志牢记毛主席的教导，抓住世界观的转变这个根本问题，活学活用“老三篇”，对“私”字，亮得彻底：不怕丢名不怕丑，翻箱倒柜全盘端；斗得有力：“那里痛，就向那里冲，那里顽固，就向那里打”，不是“割韭菜”，而是“拔大葱”；改得坚决：“横下一条心，刻苦学习，反复磨炼，脱胎换骨”。这样，他在很年青的时候，就攀上了无产阶级“公”字的高峰，成为无限忠于毛主席，完全、彻底为人民的伟大的共产主义战士。
    有些人也在学习毛主席著作，也讲改造世界观，就是不肯亮、斗、改，或者亮得躲躲闪闪，斗得不痛不痒，改得有名无实。可以肯定地说，那是一辈子也改造不好的。
    英雄四排的同志们说：“学习毛主席著作，一千遍学，一万遍学，不带着深厚的无产阶级感情学，还是假学。”对资产阶级“私”字，能不能彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改，归根结底，是个阶级感情问题。
    英雄四排的同志们牢记旧社会的阶级苦，不忘血泪仇，怀着对毛主席无比热爱的深厚的阶级感情，学习毛主席著作，对资产阶级“私”字，对一切违背毛泽东思想的言行深恶痛绝。所以他们能够以高度的革命自觉，狠抓亮、斗、改，发现“私”字，积极进攻，反复冲杀，不让它有立足之地。他们认为，头脑里有私不斗，就是对毛主席不忠。这对于那些同“私”字难舍难分，学了毛主席著作，根本不触及自己灵魂的人，是一个极好的教育。
    向英雄四排和李文忠同志学习，最重要、最根本的，就是要象李文忠同志那样，在阶级斗争中刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，坚决响应毛主席的“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，对资产阶级“私”字，彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改，彻底改造世界观，做一个紧跟毛主席寸步不离的真正的无产阶级革命战士，在无产阶级文化大革命中作出新的贡献。
