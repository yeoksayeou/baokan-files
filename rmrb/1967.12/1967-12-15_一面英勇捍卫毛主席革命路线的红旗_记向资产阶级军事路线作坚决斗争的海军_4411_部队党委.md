We are excited to introduce to you a red banner bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line—the Party Committee of the 4411 Unit of the Navy, which has been actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. This unit has been engaged in a resolute struggle against the bourgeois military line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Throughout the transitional period, there exist class contradictions, class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the struggle between the two lines of socialism and capitalism. Forgetting this basic theory and practice of our Party over the past decade or more will lead us astray."

Over the past few years, the Party Committee of the 4411 Unit has consistently followed Chairman Mao's teachings. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, they have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have engaged in a head-on struggle against the bourgeois military line promoted by China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing. This demonstrates their unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the stormy seas of class struggle, the Party Committee of the 4411 Unit has been able to see clearly, stand firmly, and withstand the pressures, precisely because they insist on learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, constantly arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. Every revolutionary soldier and cadre should strive to study Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect, combining learning with practice, and achieving immediate results. In the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, they should constantly transform themselves. Only in this way can they become steadfast defenders of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In our great motherland, a red banner flies high in the frontline of the South China Sea. This banner is unwaveringly loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This red banner is the Party Committee of the 4411 Unit of the Navy, a model unit for actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works.

In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, the Party Committee of the 4411 Unit has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have resolutely implemented and bravely defended Chairman Mao's military line, firmly executing the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin. With the fearless spirit of the proletariat, they have braved the dark winds and fought against the evil waves, engaging in a heroic struggle against the bourgeois military line promoted by China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing.

The comrades of the Party Committee of the 4411 Unit have an infinite love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. Their heroic deeds have been warmly praised by the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in the Navy, becoming a red banner bravely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Following the course set by Chairman Mao, not deviating by an inch

In 1963, the 4411 Unit experienced a turning point in its work. That year, the unit Party Committee followed the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin on naval work and seriously implemented the resolutions of the expanded meeting of the Navy Party Committee. They focused on implementing the "Four Firsts," and the unit's appearance underwent significant changes.

The Party Committee first tackled a core issue in the struggle between the two military lines: "What is the greatest combat effectiveness of our army?" They mobilized cadres and soldiers to engage in a mass debate. This was a major debate to smash the bourgeois military line and establish Chairman Mao's military thought and military line. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers, using the resolutions of the Gutian Conference drafted by Chairman Mao and the resolutions of the 1960 expanded meeting of the Military Commission chaired by Vice Chairman Lin as their weapons, sharply criticized the erroneous tendencies of some comrades who had once neglected political and ideological work and the study of Chairman Mao's works. Through this debate, a mass movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works swept through the unit.

The Party Committee deeply understood that only a revolutionary leadership cadre that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao can cultivate a revolutionary unit that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. They always placed the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works by the Party Committee itself at the forefront of all work. The standing committee established a study center group and implemented an "unshakable" study system. The Party Committee especially emphasized that leading cadres should dare to reveal their thoughts and engage in self-criticism. The comrades of the Party Committee often conducted lectures in front of the unit's cadres and soldiers, mobilizing the masses to supervise the ideological transformation of the Party Committee members.

The Party Committee led the unit. Wherever the fast boats sailed, Chairman Mao's works were studied. The first lesson for new recruits was studying the "Three Articles"; the first activity in evaluation meetings was using Chairman Mao's instructions to examine training thoughts; the first topic in technical classes was how to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in technical training; the first content in heart-to-heart talks was sharing experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. ... Mao Zedong Thought greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the unit. That year, numerous good deeds and good units emerged, and the entire unit was filled with a spirit of vigor and revolutionary enthusiasm.

However, it was during the execution of a long-distance mission that the Party Committee of the 4411 Unit truly tasted the sweetness of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and deeply felt the immense power of Chairman Mao's military thought and military line, and the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought.

That winter, the unit received a mission to conduct a long-distance voyage with torpedo boats. According to the regulations of foreign bourgeois and revisionist "authorities," torpedo boats could only operate in coastal waters. Conducting such a long-distance voyage, being too far from the coast could lead to getting lost, running out of fuel, the boats not being able to withstand the waves, and especially at night, the dangers would be even greater. In short, in the eyes of these bourgeois and revisionist gentlemen, such a long-distance voyage was simply a wild idea, doomed to failure!

Serious difficulties lay ahead. How to handle them? The majority of the comrades in the Party Committee believed: daring or not daring to carry out this long-distance voyage was actually a matter of implementing or not implementing Chairman Mao's military line and believing or not believing in the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle can be created." We should not only see the material factors but more importantly, see the human factors, the political and ideological factors. We are the great People's Liberation Army personally created and led by Chairman Mao and commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. As long as we firmly rely on Mao Zedong Thought and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, combining revolutionary daring with revolutionary scientific spirit, we can overcome any difficulty.

The preparations for the long-distance voyage began. Some suggested replacing a few politically red but technically average boat captains with the unit's technical "elites." The deputy secretary of the Party Committee in charge of organizing the long-distance voyage, Wu Yi, decisively replied: "The long-distance voyage relies on politics, not on replacing people!" The Party Committee further clarified: "The first priority in preparing for the long-distance voyage is political and ideological preparation." The Party Committee members went deep into each boat, organizing the unit to study Chairman Mao's instructions on the relationship between spirit and matter, people and weapons, politics and military affairs, and thought and technology. The activities for preparing for the long-distance voyage became a large classroom for actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works.

That night, the fast boats set sail. As soon as they left the outer harbor, they encountered strong winter winds. Dark, towering waves rolled towards them, and the fast boats seemed to be moving upright. "Bang! Bang! Bang!" The stern seemed to hit rocks, rising high and then falling back down. The entire journey was in a very dangerous situation.

However, the soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought overcame all difficulties and dangers. "Determine to fight, unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The language of Chairman Mao's quotations was passed from the deck to the bottom of the boat, to every person's hands, and imprinted in every person's heart. Wherever the highest instructions reached, there were loud slogans: "No matter how big the waves, they are under our feet!" "The will of the sailors is as firm as steel, great winds and waves are nothing!" The radio operator Liang Hanying was thrown against the fast boat's keel by a wave, breaking his collarbone. But he did not make a sound, enduring the pain, and continued to stand at his post. In the hands of revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, mechanical instruments performed miracles: fuel was conserved to the minimum; the radar's observation range exceeded the original design by one fold; wireless communication crossed thousands of mountains and rivers, maintaining uninterrupted contact with the leadership; in long-term violent shaking, dozens of machines operated normally without a second of failure. In the vast night sea, without any navigational targets, guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the fleet maintained the correct course.

The long-distance voyage fleet rode the winds and waves, advancing swiftly! In the faint morning light, a red sun rose from the eastern horizon, dyeing the sea red. Just at that moment, the destination of this long-distance voyage appeared straight ahead. Immediately, every boat echoed with a jubilant slogan: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" Along with the rising of the red sun, the song "The East is Red" drowned out the howling winds and waves, resonating through the sky and sea!

"The great ocean voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought!" The "classics" praised by bourgeois and revisionist "authorities," which are detached from practical requirements, were thrown into the sea by soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. People cheered for the successful completion of the long-distance voyage mission, and even more enthusiastically cheered for the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of Chairman Mao's military line!

This was a revolutionary long-distance voyage! It was a revolution in the history of torpedo boat navigation and a revolution in the unit's ideology. After this long-distance voyage, the Party Committee and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the 4411 Unit checked the results of a year of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and further understood that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest combat effectiveness. The comrades of the Party Committee said well:

"The course of the fast boat deviates or not mainly depends on whether our ideological course deviates or not; whether the fuel is sufficient or not mainly depends on whether our revolutionary spirit is sufficient or not; whether the fast boat's wave-resistance is enough or not mainly depends on whether our political and ideological work is sufficient or not."

Chairman Mao's military line and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on focusing on the "Four Firsts" took root in the unit's ideology. The mass movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works was carried out more consciously, more deeply, and more effectively in the unit.

Defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, not yielding an inch

Implementing Chairman Mao's military line was not smooth sailing. Every step forward required a serious struggle.

Just as the 4411 Unit was correcting its direction and advancing victoriously in 1964, China's Khrushchev's agent Luo Ruiqing launched a reactionary countercurrent of large-scale competitions, fiercely attacking Chairman Mao's military line. This was a major exposure of Luo Ruiqing's stubborn insistence on the bourgeois military thought and military line, and his plot to usurp the military and engage in counter-revolutionary activities.

One day in June, the Party Committee secretary and political commissar Zhang Yongqian went to a certain base to inspect work. As soon as he stepped into the door of the second platoon of the guard company, he saw that the wall plaque with Chairman Mao's quotations had been replaced with shooting techniques, which made his heart tremble. The second platoon was originally a famous backward platoon. In the high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the unit, this platoon focused on studying Chairman Mao's works and carried out a thorough ideological revolution, rapidly raising political awareness, transforming from a backward platoon to a model platoon in the unit. However, now this "model platoon" had replaced Chairman Mao's quotations with shooting techniques on the wall plaque. Was this a trivial matter?

Zhang Yongqian keenly grasped the problem of the second platoon and conducted an in-depth investigation. He immediately convened a standing committee meeting. Everyone reviewed the unit's detour before 1963, compared it with the unit's rapid progress along Chairman Mao's military line over the past year, and deeply felt the seriousness of the problem. Chairman Mao said: "The 'Four Firsts' are good, this is a creation." Why did some people not listen to Chairman Mao's words, not interested in the "Four Firsts" proposed by Vice Chairman Lin, and insisted on doing their own thing? If this tendency was allowed to develop, it would wash away the unit's mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works and make the unit turn back.

The Party Committee decided to sound the alarm to prevent the unit from turning back. On one hand, they sent people to talk to individual leading cadres who were busy with large-scale competitions, and on the other hand, they organized a large number of cadres to inspect the implementation of the "Four Firsts" in the unit. Zhang Yongqian personally led a working group to inspect political and ideological work in the unit. Wherever he went, he loudly declared: "Competitions cannot replace the 'Four Firsts,'" "Competitions must prevent turning back," "'Four Firsts' is proposed by Comrade Lin Biao, it is a fundamental strategy, it must be implemented long-term and forever!" The Party Committee's alarm bells rang louder and louder, and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers became more alert and resolute in resisting and struggling against large-scale competitions.

Soon, the reactionary waves of large-scale competitions launched by Luo Ruiqing hit the unit again. Before this struggle arrived, the unit Party Committee made a clear-cut decision in response: while carrying out large-scale competitions, the unit held a political work meeting and a conference to share experiences in actively learning Chairman Mao's works. The Party Committee clearly pointed out: two meetings, one topic: inspecting and implementing the "Four Firsts," other work should not dilute this central content. As soon as the meeting ended, the cadres should immediately go down to implement the meeting's spirit.

During the large-scale competitions, the units participating in the "technical elites" competitions trained day and night at sea, and the study of Chairman Mao's works, political education, and party and league activities were all washed away. The unit Party Committee responded in kind, sending working groups to help these units study Chairman Mao's works, ensuring that the unit could insist on studying Chairman Mao's works every day under any difficult conditions and always put politics in the first place. The unit returned from sea training, regardless of whether it was dawn or night, or how tired and exhausted they were, they always studied Chairman Mao's works collectively for an hour. The soldiers said: "Even if we go to sea several times a day, we must insist on studying no matter how tired we are!"

As soon as the large-scale competitions ended, the Party Committee conducted a specific investigation on the ideological impact of the large-scale competitions on the unit. At the Party Committee meeting, they specifically inspected the implementation of the "Four Firsts." Then, using the resolutions of the Gutian Conference and the 1960 expanded meeting of the Military Commission as weapons, they mobilized the masses to debate again around the issue of "What is the greatest combat effectiveness of our army," thoroughly eliminating the poison of the bourgeois military line promoted by Luo Ruiqing.

Reactionary currents will never become the mainstream. On the eve of New Year's Day in 1965, Vice Chairman Lin issued the instruction to "emphasize politics" to the entire army. What an exciting instruction! This instruction timely stopped the reactionary current of large-scale competitions and dealt a fatal blow to Luo Ruiqing's evil plot. This instruction was warmly welcomed and supported by the broad masses of cadres and soldiers. The 4411 Unit most resolutely, actively, and thoroughly implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instruction.

The unit Party Committee, with the problems in the struggle, restudied Chairman Mao's discussions on class struggle in the socialist period. Chairman Mao said: "In this historical stage of socialism, class, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist, and there is a struggle between socialism and capitalism, two roads. There is the danger of capitalist restoration. We must recognize the long-term and complex nature of this struggle. We must be vigilant." Chairman Mao's teachings made everyone have a deeper understanding of this segment of the struggle against the reactionary current of large-scale competitions. Using large-scale competitions to impact the "Four Firsts" and the study of Chairman Mao's works was an attempt to shake the foundation of our military construction, dig out the soul of our army, and change the color of our army! This was a continuation of the struggle between the two military lines under new conditions and a reflection of the class struggle within the unit.

Everyone deeply felt: as leading cadres, they must be infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, consciously strive to study Chairman Mao's works, seriously transform their worldview, and always keep the string of class struggle tight in their minds, deeply engraving the line of struggle. Only by truly arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, always maintaining the concept of class struggle and line struggle, thoroughly eliminating selfish and impure thoughts, can they maintain a keen political sense and judgment, not turn back or lose their way in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads; only then can they have the determination and courage to go against the wind and waves, and struggle resolutely to implement Chairman Mao's military line.

An unchanging red heart, loyal to Chairman Mao for life

In the fierce struggle between the two military lines, the Party Committee of the fast boat unit led the entire unit to stride forward towards the goal of being highly proletarian and highly combat-ready.

To further implement Chairman Mao's military line in the Navy, the revolutionary leading cadres of the Navy who insist on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line decided to focus on cultivating this unit as a model for the Navy, and personally went to guide them several times.

What kind of model to establish is a major issue related to the direction of Navy construction. China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing understood this. Therefore, as soon as this decision was made, they fiercely opposed it. The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing even personally went to the unit to incite counter-revolutionary winds and light counter-revolutionary fires.

"Have you studied Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to emphasize politics?" Luo Ruiqing asked with ulterior motives in a cadre meeting.

Everyone unanimously replied: "We have studied it!"

"What do you think of Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to emphasize politics?"

Everyone replied even more loudly: "Vice Chairman Lin's instruction is very good!"

Luo Ruiqing took a blow but was not convinced, and cunningly incited: "There must be opinions. Either not agreeing, or mostly agreeing, partly not agreeing."

Everyone listened and felt more and more that it was not right, thinking that it was a direct opposition to Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to emphasize politics.

The fox's tail can't be hidden forever. Luo Ruiqing, this counter-revolutionary conspirator, couldn't hold back anymore and loudly shouted: "The military training work in 1964 is the best year since the founding of the country. The achievements of large-scale competitions are the main ones. One can be angry, but one cannot vent."

Luo Ruiqing's performance not only failed to achieve his sinister purpose but also helped everyone see through his ugly face. Luo Ruiqing had to leave in disgrace.

However, the struggle did not end. From the black headquarters of China's Khrushchev, black winds kept blowing, directly sabotaging and obstructing the implementation of Chairman Mao's military line in this unit. The unit's overall work deployment for implementing Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to emphasize politics was disrupted, and the mass movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works was impacted. The unit Party Committee did not implement their black instructions, so they used all their counter-revolutionary means to fiercely attack, retaliate, expel, and frame. Their evil purpose was to uproot this red banner that resolutely implements Chairman Mao's military line; to attempt to lead the entire Navy astray; to fiercely oppose Chairman Mao's military line and Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to emphasize politics. In short, it was to fiercely oppose Mao Zedong Thought!

What to do? Facing this "giant monster," dare or not dare to struggle against them? Dare or not dare to overthrow them, rebel against them? The comrades of the Party Committee conducted serious thinking: why did China's Khrushchev and Luo Ruiqing hate Chairman Mao's military line so much, fear it so much? Why did they fiercely attack and persecute those who were loyal to Chairman Mao and implemented Chairman Mao's military line? The comrades of the Party Committee studied Chairman Mao's works together, the more they studied, the clearer their minds became; the more they studied, the brighter their eyes became. Everyone realized that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the greatest teacher of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and the brightest red sun in our hearts. A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party want to usurp the Party and the military. They first direct their spears at our great leader Chairman Mao, at the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, and at Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must swear to defend Chairman Mao, swear to defend Mao Zedong Thought, and swear to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This is the greatest loyalty of a revolutionary soldier to the Party and the people.

"To struggle is to have sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence. But we think of the interests of the people, think of the pain of the majority of the people. We die for the people, and it is a worthy death." Zhang Yongqian repeatedly read Chairman Mao's teachings. In the years of war, the images of comrades-in-arms who sacrificed their lives to seize revolutionary power appeared before his eyes one by one. "Revolutionary power is hard to come by!" "If the counter-revolutionary revisionists' evil purpose of opposing Chairman Mao and opposing Mao Zedong Thought succeeds, the proletarian dictatorship will be lost, and millions of people will lose their heads!" Thinking of this, all the possible misfortunes for the individual were thrown to the back of the mind, and the body was filled with boundless strength!

Wu Yi, suffering from a serious illness, still insisted on studying Chairman Mao's instructions on class struggle. He gazed at Chairman Mao's portrait hanging on the bedhead for a long time, recalling the scene of seeing Chairman Mao in Yan'an, recalling the thirty-year revolutionary journey following Chairman Mao, and the more he thought, the more excited he became. He wrote down these lines: "It doesn't matter if you are beheaded, as long as the cause is true; with Chairman Mao in your heart, you are not afraid of these ghosts and demons!"

Chairman Mao said: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the comrades of the Party Committee conducted sharp criticism of any attempt to compromise contradictions, avoid struggles, even for a moment. They held the treasure book, looked at the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, and made an ironclad vow: "Alive, stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; dead, leave a loyal character to Chairman Mao!" They decided to bravely face the stormy winds and waves, stand straight and charge forward, daring to take on any "risk." To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, no matter who you are, you must struggle with them! Struggle to the end!

The unit Party Committee wanted to hold a training class for studying Chairman Mao's works. A counter-revolutionary revisionist black wind immediately blew: "The combat readiness work is so tense, why are you holding a training class for studying Chairman Mao's works? Don't hold it!" The unit Party Committee firmly resisted, not giving an inch. Then came a "three no's": "Do not take too many people, do not occupy regular class time, and one session of training should not exceed three evenings." For these "black instructions," the Party Committee secretary Zhang Yongqian firmly replied: "Ignore them, we do what we do!" The unit, according to the original plan, selected more than two hundred cadres to study off-duty, one week per session, and completed the training in batches.

One plan failed, and another "black instruction" came: to indefinitely extend the original three-day camouflage plan, to stop all other political activities in the unit, to cut grass, transport grass, and lay grass all day, to turn the parade ground and positions into a garden, attempting to wash away all the unit's political work. At this critical moment, the unit Party Committee realized: these practices do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, do not conform to Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to emphasize politics, so they firmly adhered to Chairman Mao's instructions as the highest instructions and announced: cancel this "black instruction."

Struggle, struggle head-on!

You want to weaken the unit's political work organizationally, trying to cut political cadres by nearly half, I will firmly resist, not cutting one, but increasing by half; you peddle bourgeois "weaponry first" black goods to the unit, attempting to negate the "Four Firsts" and confuse the unit's ideology, I will organize the unit to hold a debate on emphasizing politics, to disinfect; you show slides advocating "weapons first," I will show slides advocating the "Four Firsts"; you talk about the power of weapons, I will talk about the greatest combat effectiveness being people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

China's Khrushchev and Luo Ruiqing hated the fast boat unit Party Committee's brave struggle to the bone, labeling the comrades of the Party Committee with a pile of "hats" and fabricating various "charges." However, revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless. This hat, that hat, they do not wear one! Half a hat, they do not wear! This charge, that charge, they do not admit one! Half a charge, they do not admit! On the contrary, they used various occasions to expose and accuse the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev and his henchman Luo Ruiqing, to loudly advocate Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and to struggle for every inch of ground for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The more they struggled, the higher the unit Party Committee held the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought; the more they struggled, the deeper Chairman Mao's military thought and military line penetrated the hearts of the people; the more they struggled, the higher the unit's class consciousness, the more ardent the revolutionary spirit, and the greater the achievements in various works. That year, units that had nothing to do with the "Four Good" were all rated as "Four Good"; that year, military training made new leaps; and it was also in that year that the fast boat unit achieved a major victory of sinking enemy ships in coordination with brother ships in a naval battle.

"The cock crows, and the world is bright." Our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, completely destroying the bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev. Under new historical conditions, the Party Committee of the fast boat unit and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, with their infinitely loyal red hearts to the great helmsman Chairman Mao, resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great battle call to "support the leftist broad masses," actively participated in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work. They most resolutely executed every new instruction of the great commander Chairman Mao, step by step, sentence by sentence, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, becoming a strong backing for the broad leftist masses, and were praised by the revolutionary masses as "loyal defenders of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line," establishing new merits for the people.

Victory belongs forever to the great commander Chairman Mao!

Victory belongs forever to the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought!

Victory belongs forever to the proletarian revolutionary soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

The red banner of the fast boat unit Party Committee, which was established in the struggle between the two lines, finally broke through the stormy winds and waves, flying high in the sky of the motherland.

　　一面英勇捍卫毛主席革命路线的红旗
　　——记向资产阶级军事路线作坚决斗争的海军4411部队党委
    编者按　我们怀着兴奋的心情，向同志们介绍一面英勇捍卫毛主席革命路线的红旗——海军活学活用毛主席著作标兵、4411部队党委的斗争事迹。
    毛主席教导我们：“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去。”
    几年来，4411部队党委一直遵循着毛主席的教导，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线，进行了针锋相对的斗争，表现了对伟大领袖毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。在阶级斗争的风浪中，4411部队党委所以能够看得清，站得稳，顶得住，正是他们坚持活学活用毛主席著作，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己头脑的结果。每个革命战士和革命干部，都应该努力学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，学用结合，立竿见影，在“斗私，批修”中不断地改造自己。只有这样，才能做一个捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的坚强战士。
    在我们伟大祖国的南海前哨，飘扬着一面无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的鲜红的旗帜。这面红旗，就是海军活学活用毛主席著作标兵、4411部队党委。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，4411部队党委高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻、勇敢捍卫毛主席的建军路线，坚决执行林副主席的指示，以无私无畏的无产阶级英雄气概，顶黑风，战恶浪，向着中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿推行的资产阶级军事路线，进行了英勇的搏斗。
    4411部队党委的同志们对伟大领袖毛主席，对光焰无际的毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。他们的英雄行为，受到海军广大干部、战士的热烈称颂，成为一面勇敢捍卫毛主席革命路线的红旗。
    沿着毛主席指引的航向，一度不偏
    一九六三年，是4411部队工作的一个转折点。在这一年，部队党委遵照林副主席对海军工作的指示，认真贯彻海军党委扩大会议决议，狠抓“四个第一”落实，部队面貌发生了很大变化。
    党委首先抓住了两条建军路线斗争中的一个核心问题：“什么是我军最大的战斗力？”发动干部、战士，进行了一场群众性的大辩论。这是一次大破资产阶级军事路线，大立毛主席军事思想和建军路线的大辩论。广大干部、战士以毛主席亲自起草的古田会议决议为武器，以林副主席亲自主持制定的一九六○年军委扩大会议决议为依据，尖锐地批判了某些同志一度产生的忽视政治思想工作、忽视毛主席著作学习的错误倾向。通过这场辩论，一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，在部队里轰轰烈烈地开展起来。
    部队党委深刻认识到：只有对毛主席无限忠诚的革命化的领导班子，才能培养出无限忠于毛主席的革命化的部队。他们始终把党委本身的活学活用毛主席著作，摆在一切工作的首位。党委常委成立了学习中心组，建立了“雷打不动”的学习制度。党委特别强调领导干部学习毛主席著作要敢于亮思想、斗私心。党委的同志经常在部队干部、战士面前进行讲用，发动群众监督党委同志的思想改造。
    党委带动了部队。快艇航行到哪里，毛主席著作就学到哪里。新战士入伍第一课，是学习“老三篇”；讲评会上的第一项活动，是用毛主席指示检查练兵思想；技术课的第一个题目，是讲技术训练中如何活学活用毛主席著作；同志之间谈心的第一个内容，是学习毛主席著作的体会。……毛泽东思想大大促进了部队的思想革命化。在这一年，部队的好人好事大量涌现，四好连队成倍地增长，整个部队充满了一派精神奋发、斗志昂扬的革命气象。
    然而，部队党委真正尝到活学活用毛主席著作的甜头，更加深刻地体会到毛主席军事思想和建军路线的无比威力，毛泽东思想的无比威力，还是在执行一次远航任务的时候。
    这一年冬天，部队接受了一项鱼雷快艇远航的任务。按照那些外国资产阶级、修正主义“权威”的规定：快艇只能在近海活动。进行这样的远航，离海岸太远会迷航，燃料会不够用，艇只顶不住风浪，尤其是在夜间航行，危险就更大……。一句话，照这些资产阶级、修正主义老爷们看来，这样的远航，简直是异想天开，注定非失败不可！
    严重的困难摆在面前，怎么办？部队党委多数同志认为：敢不敢进行这次远航，实际上是执行不执行毛主席的建军路线，相信不相信毛泽东思想的无比威力的问题。“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”我们不能只看到物的因素，更重要的是要看到人的因素，政治思想的因素。我们是毛主席亲自缔造和领导、林副主席亲自指挥的伟大的人民解放军。只要我们紧紧依靠毛泽东思想，紧紧依靠广大干部、战士，将革命的胆略和革命的科学精神结合起来，再大的困难也能克服。
    远航的准备工作开始了。有人主张把几个思想红、技术水平一般的艇长换下去，换成部队的技术“尖子”。负责组织这次远航的党委副书记武毅斩钉截铁地回答：“远航靠的是政治，不能换！”党委进一步明确地指出：“远航的准备，第一位的是政治思想的准备。”党委委员们分别深入各艇，组织部队学习毛主席论述精神和物质、人和武器、政治和军事、思想和技术的关系的指示。远航的准备工作活动，变成了一个活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。
    这天深夜，快艇启航了。刚出了外港，就遇到了冬季强风。黑呼呼的巨浪迎头卷来，快艇简直是竖着前进。“蹬！蹬！蹬！”艇尾好象撞击在岩石上，一下子抛高，一下子又摔下。整个航程，始终处在十分艰险的情况下。
    但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，压倒了任何困难和艰险。“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”写着毛主席语录的纸条，从舱面传到舱底，传到每一个人手里，印在每一个人的心上。最高指示传到哪里，哪里就响起响亮的鼓动口号：“风浪再大，都在我们脚下！”“水兵意志如钢坚，大风大浪只等闲！”电航兵梁汉英被一阵恶浪推撞到快艇的龙骨上，锁骨都摔断了。但是他一声不吭，忍着剧痛，一直坚持在战斗岗位上。在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士手里，机械仪器发挥了奇异的性能：油料节约到最低限度；雷达的观测距离超过了原设计的一倍；无线电越过千山万水，同领导机关的联系一直畅通无阻；在长时间的剧烈颠簸中，几十部机器一直正常运转，没有发生一秒钟故障。在茫茫夜海里，在没有任何测定目标的情况下，靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想引导，艇队始终保持了正确的航向。
    远航的艇队乘风破浪，飞速前进！在晨光熹微中，一轮红日跃出东方的海面，把海水照得通红通红！就在这一瞬间，这次远航的目的地，不偏不斜地出现在正前方。顿时，每艘艇上都响起了一片欢腾的口号：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”随着红日的腾起，《东方红》的歌声压倒狂风恶浪，响彻海空！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想！”资产阶级、修正主义“权威”们捧为“经典”、脱离实践要求的教范和条令，都被毛泽东思想武装起来的战士抛进大海。人们欢呼远航任务的胜利完成，更无比热烈地欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，欢呼毛主席建军路线的伟大胜利！
    这是一次革命的远航！既是鱼雷快艇的航海史上的一次革命，也是部队思想上的一次革命。经过这次远航，部队党委和广大干部、战士，检验了一年来活学活用毛主席著作的成果，进一步体会到，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。党委的同志们说得好：
  “快艇的航向偏不偏，主要是看我们思想的航向偏不偏；燃料足不足，主要是看我们的革命干劲足不足；快艇的耐波力够不够，主要是看我们的思想政治工作做得够不够。”
    毛主席的建军路线，林副主席关于狠抓“四个第一”的指示，在部队思想上扎了根。活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，在部队里更加自觉、更加深入、更有成效地开展起来。
    捍卫毛主席的革命路线，一步不让
    贯彻执行毛主席的建军路线，并不是一帆风顺的。每前进一步，都要经过严重的斗争。
    就在4411部队端正方向，胜利前进的一九六四年，中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人罗瑞卿掀起了大比武的反动逆流，向毛主席的建军路线进行了猖狂冲击。这是罗瑞卿顽固坚持资产阶级军事思想和建军路线，进行篡军、反党阴谋活动的一次大暴露。
    六月的一天，部队党委书记、政治委员张永前同志到某基地检查工作。他刚跨进警卫排二班的门，一眼看到壁上的毛主席语录牌，竟被换写上了射击要领，不由得心里一阵震动。二班原来是一个有名的后进班，在部队活学活用毛主席著作的高潮中，这个班狠抓毛主席著作学习，大搞人的思想革命化，政治觉悟迅速提高，由后进班一跃成为部队的“标兵班”。可是，现在这个“标兵班”竟在毛主席语录牌上换写射击要领，这难道是个一般性的问题吗？
    张永前同志敏锐地抓住了二班的问题，作了深入的调查，并且立即召开了常委会。大家回顾了一九六三年以前部队走过的一段弯路，对比了一年多来部队沿着毛主席建军路线飞速前进的事实，深深感到问题的严重。毛主席说：“四个第一好，这是个创造。”为什么有些人不听毛主席的话，对林副主席提出的“四个第一”不感兴趣，偏偏要另搞一套呢？如果听任这种倾向发展下去，就会把部队学习毛主席著作的群众运动冲掉，就会使部队转向，走回头路。
    党委决定向部队敲响防止转向的警钟。一面派人同埋头搞大比武的个别领导干部谈话，一面组织大批干部到部队检查“四个第一”落实的情况。张永前同志亲自带领工作组深入部队检查政治思想工作。他无论走到哪里，都大声疾呼：“比武不能代替‘四个第一’”，“比武要防止转向。”“‘四个第一’是林彪同志提出来的，是根本大计，要长期贯彻，永远贯彻！”党委的警钟越敲越响，广大干部、战士对大比武的警觉性越来越高，抵制和斗争也越来越坚决。
    不久，罗瑞卿掀起的大比武的恶浪，又一次冲击到这个部队。在这场斗争到来以前，部队党委针锋相对地作了一个旗帜鲜明的决定：在搞大比武的同时，部队召开政工会和学习毛主席著作积极分子经验座谈会。党委明确指出：两个会议，一个议题：检查和落实“四个第一”，其他工作不得冲淡这个中心内容。会一开完，干部要立即下去贯彻会议精神。
    在大比武期间，参加大比武的“技术尖子”单位，白天黑夜出海练武，毛主席著作的学习、政治教育和党团生活都被冲掉了。部队党委就针锋相对，派出工作组，帮助这些单位学习毛主席著作，使部队在任何艰难困苦的条件下，都能坚持天天读毛主席的书，始终把政治摆在第一位。部队出海回来，不管是黎明还是黑夜，也不管再困、再累，总要集体学习一个小时毛主席著作。战士们说：“就是一天出海几次，再累也要坚持学习！”
    大比武一收场，党委就对大比武给部队带来的思想影响作了具体调查。在党委会上，专门检查了“四个第一”落实的情况。接着，又以古田会议决议和一九六○年军委扩大会议决议为武器，发动群众，围绕
  “什么是我军最大的战斗力”问题，再一次进行了一场大辩论，肃清罗瑞卿所推行的资产阶级军事路线的流毒。
    反动的逆流，终究不会成为主流。一九六五年元旦前夕，林副主席向全军发出了“突出政治”的指示。这是一个多么激动人心的指示啊！这个指示及时地遏止了大比武的逆流，给了罗瑞卿的罪恶阴谋一个致命的打击。这个指示受到了广大干部战士的热烈欢迎和拥护。4411部队最坚决、最积极、最彻底地贯彻执行了林副主席的这一指示。
    部队党委带着斗争中的问题，重新学习了毛主席有关社会主义时期阶级斗争的论述。毛主席说：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。要认识这种斗争的长期性和复杂性。要提高警惕。”毛主席的教导，使大家对这一段抵制大比武逆流的斗争，有了更深刻的认识。用大比武冲击“四个第一”，冲击毛主席著作的学习，这就是企图动摇我军建设的根本，挖掉我军的灵魂，就是要使我们的军队改变颜色！这是两条军事路线的斗争在新条件下的继续，是两个阶级的斗争在部队内部的反映。
    大家深深地感到：作为领导干部，一定要无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，一定要自觉地努力学习毛主席著作，认真改造世界观，在头脑里时刻上紧阶级斗争这根“弦”，刻深路线斗争这根“线”。只有真正用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，时刻保持阶级斗争的观念、路线斗争的观念，彻底铲除私心杂念，才能保持敏锐的政治嗅觉和判断能力，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中不转向、不迷航；才能具有顶风破浪、逆流而上的决心和勇气，为贯彻执行毛主席的建军路线而坚决斗争。
    无限忠于毛主席的红心，一辈子不变
    在两条军事路线的激烈斗争中，快艇部队党委率领着整个部队，朝着非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的目标大踏步前进。
    为了在海军进一步贯彻毛主席的建军路线，坚持毛主席革命路线的海军革命领导干部的意见：重点培养这个部队为海军的标兵，并多次亲自去进行指导。
    树立一个什么样的标兵，这是关系海军建设方向的重大问题。中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿是懂得这一点的。因此，这个决定刚一发出，就遭到了他们的疯狂反对。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿居然亲自出马，跑到这个部队去煽反革命之风，点反革命之火。
    “林总突出政治的指示，学过了吗？”在一次干部会议上，罗瑞卿别有用心地问大家。
    同志们异口同声地回答：“学过了！”
    “你们对林总突出政治的指示有什么意见？”
    大家回答得更响亮：“林副主席的指示好得很！”
    罗瑞卿挨了一闷棍，还不死心，又阴险地煽动说：“总会有意见的。或者不赞成，或者大部赞成，部分不赞成。”
    大家越听越感到不是味道，认为是直接反对林副主席突出政治的指示的。
    狐狸尾巴总是藏不住的。罗瑞卿这个反革命野心家再也忍不住了，凶相毕露地叫嚷什么：一九六四年的军事训练工作，是建国以来最好的一年。大比武的成绩是主要的。气可鼓，不可泄。
    罗瑞卿这一番表演，不但没有达到他的阴险目的，反而帮助大家识破了他的丑恶面目。罗瑞卿不得不灰溜溜地走了。
    但是，斗争并没有结束。从中国赫鲁晓夫的黑司令部里，不断刮来阵阵黑风，直接破坏和阻挠毛主席建军路线在这个部队的贯彻执行。部队关于执行林副主席突出政治指示的全盘工作部署被干扰，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动被冲击。部队党委不执行他们的黑指示，他们就施展全部反革命手段，疯狂地进行打击、报复、排挤、陷害。他们的罪恶目的，就是要拔掉这面坚决贯彻毛主席建军路线的红旗；就是妄图把整个海军引向歧路上去；就是要大反毛主席的建军路线，大反林副主席突出政治的指示。一句话，就是要大反毛泽东思想！
    怎么办？面对着这个“庞然大物”，敢不敢同他们进行斗争？敢不敢革他们的命，造他们的反？党委的同志进行了认真的思考：为什么中国的赫鲁晓夫和罗瑞卿对毛主席的建军路线这样恨得要命，怕得要死？为什么谁忠于毛主席，贯彻毛主席建军路线，他们就疯狂地打击谁，迫害谁？党委同志在一起学习了毛主席著作，越学，心越明；越学，眼越亮。大家认识到，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是中国人民和全世界革命人民的最伟大的导师，是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子要想篡党、篡军，他们首先就要把矛头指向我们的伟大领袖毛主席，指向光焰无际的毛泽东思想，指向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们一定要誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线。这是一个革命战士对党、对人民最大的忠诚。
      “要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”张永前同志一遍又一遍地读着毛主席的教导。在战争年代里为夺取革命政权而牺牲的战友，一个个地映现在他的眼前。“革命的政权来之不易啊！”“如果让反革命修正主义分子反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的罪恶目的得逞，无产阶级政权就会丧失，千百万人就会人头落地！”想到这里，个人可能遭遇到的一切不幸，统统丢在了脑后，周身充满了无穷的力量！
    武毅同志身患重病，仍然坚持学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的指示。他久久地凝视着贴在床头的毛主席画像，回想起在延安见到毛主席的情景，回想起三十年来跟着毛主席干革命的战斗历程，越想心情越激动。提笔写下了这样的诗句：“杀头不要紧，只要主义真；心有毛主席，那怕你们这些牛鬼蛇神！”
    毛主席说：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”遵照毛主席的教导，党委的同志对自己头脑里任何一点企图调和矛盾、躲避斗争的想法，哪怕是一瞬间的想法，都进行了尖锐的批判。他们手捧宝书，眼望伟大领袖毛主席像，发出了钢铁般的誓言：“活着，要站在毛主席的革命路线上；死了，也要留下对毛主席的一个忠字！”他们下定决心，一定要迎着狂风恶浪，挺直腰杆往前冲，再大的“风险”也敢于承担。为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，不管你是什么样的“大人物”，也要跟你斗！斗到底！
    部队党委要办学习毛主席著作训练班。一阵反革命修正主义的黑风马上刮过来：“战备工作那么紧张，你们还搞什么毛主席著作训练班？不要搞！”部队党委坚决顶住，寸步不让。于是又来了个三“不得”：“不得多抽人，不得占用正课时间，一期轮训不得超过三个晚上。”对于这些“黑指示”，党委书记张永前坚定地回答：“不理他，我们搞我们的！”部队按照原定计划，抽调二百多名干部离职学习，每期一周，分批轮训完毕。
    一着不成，又来一道“黑指示”：要把原定三天阵地伪装的计划无限期延长，要部队停止一切其他政治活动，成天铲草皮，运草皮，铺草皮，要把操场、阵地搞成花园，妄想把部队的政治工作全部冲掉。在这个关键时刻，部队党委认识到：这些做法不符合毛泽东思想，不符合林副主席突出政治的指示，就坚定不移地以毛主席指示为最高指示，断然宣布：取消这条“黑指示”。
    斗争，针锋相对地斗争！
    你要从组织上削弱部队政治工作，想把政治干部砍掉近一半，我就坚决抵制，不仅一个不砍，反而增加了一半；你向部队贩卖资产阶级“唯武器论”的黑货，妄想否定“四个第一”，把部队思想搞乱，我就组织部队进行突出政治的大辩论，进行消毒；你放映宣扬“武器第一”的幻灯，我就放映宣扬“四个第一”的幻灯；你讲武器装备的威力，我就大讲最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫和罗瑞卿对快艇部队党委的这种英勇斗争恨之入骨，给党委的同志扣上了一堆“帽子”，捏造了种种“罪名”。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士是无所畏惧的。这一顶“帽子”，那一顶“帽子”，他们一顶也不戴！半顶也不戴！这一条“罪”名，那一条“罪”名，他们一条也不承认！半条也不承认！相反地，他们利用各种场合，揭发和控诉中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙罗瑞卿的反革命滔天罪行，大讲特讲毛主席的革命路线，大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，为毛主席的革命路线争夺每一个阵地。越斗，部队党委把毛泽东思想红旗举得越高，毛主席的军事思想、建军路线越深入人心；越斗，部队的阶级觉悟越提高，革命精神越昂扬，各项工作的成绩越大。这一年，过去和四好不沾边的单位，都评上了四好；这一年，军事训练有了新的跃进；也就在这一年，快艇部队在配合兄弟舰艇作战中，在一次海战中取得了击沉敌舰的重大胜利。
    “一唱雄鸡天下白”。我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部。在新的历史条件下，快艇部队党委和广大指战员，怀着对伟大舵手毛主席无限忠诚的红心，坚决响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大战斗号召，积极投入了“三支”“两军”工作。他们最坚决地执行伟大统帅毛主席的每一个最新指示，步步紧跟，句句照办，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚定不移地站在毛主席革命路线一边，成为左派广大群众的坚强后盾，被广大革命群众称赞为“毛主席革命路线的忠实捍卫者”，为人民立下了新的功勋。
    胜利永远属于伟大统帅毛主席！
    胜利永远属于光焰无际的毛泽东思想！
    胜利永远属于无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命战士！
    快艇部队党委这面在两条路线斗争中树立起来的红旗，终于冲破狂风恶浪，高高地飘扬在祖国的上空。
