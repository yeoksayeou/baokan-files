The China-Japan Friendship Association and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade sent telegrams on December 4th to the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, strongly condemning the fascist atrocities committed by the Japanese Sato reactionary government on November 29th. The government dispatched a large number of police to forcibly search the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, and the residence of Sakata Teruaki, a standing member of the National Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine). The telegrams expressed resolute support for the Japanese revolutionary people's just struggle against American imperialism and for national independence.

In the telegram, the China-Japan Friendship Association pointed out that the Sato reactionary government's fascist atrocities are a serious step in its consistent hostility towards China, its frenzied sabotage of the China-Japan friendship movement, and its interference in China-Japan trade. It is a naked political provocation against the peoples of both China and Japan.

The telegram said that the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) has raised the banner of China-Japan friendship, resolutely opposing the anti-China clowns of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Japan Communist Party revisionist clique. It has conducted a just struggle against American imperialism and made outstanding contributions to the China-Japan friendship movement and the national democratic movement.

The telegram said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' Your struggle is completely just. We resolutely support and endorse it. The just struggle will surely win! The more fiercely Sato opposes China, the more miserable his failure will be. He will ultimately be thoroughly buried by the revolutionary torrent of the people! The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will forever stand together with you, fight together with you, and win together with you."

The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade pointed out in its telegram that after the recent talks between the pro-American traitor Prime Minister Sato and the head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, and after Sato invited Chiang Kai-shek's son to Japan, it is not accidental that the Sato reactionary government has imposed fascist repression on the Japanese people. This is another blatant exposure of the Sato reactionary government's more brazen pursuit of U.S. imperialism, intensified anti-China stance, revival of militarism, and implementation of fascist policies. The telegram said that the Japanese people's persistent struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the Sato government is completely in line with the interests of the broad masses of the Japanese and Asian peoples. We are deeply convinced that the Japanese revolutionary people will surely achieve final victory in their just struggle against American imperialism.

The New China News Agency reported from Tokyo that on November 30th, the chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Nakajima Kenzo, issued a statement strongly protesting the Sato reactionary government's dispatch of police and special agents to illegally search and suppress the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, which are dedicated to promoting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China and developing China-Japan friendly trade. Nakajima in his statement denounced the despicable pretexts manufactured by the Japanese reactionary authorities for this fascist atrocity and pointed out that the mass action at Haneda Airport on November 12th protesting Sato's visit to the United States represented the voice and will of the Japanese people. Nakajima pointed out that this atrocity exposed the Sato government's attempt to completely destroy relations between Japan and China, sell the sacred Japanese territory of Okinawa, and drag the Japanese people into the quagmire of U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war. Nakajima expressed his determination to mobilize public opinion and resolutely fight against the savage suppression by the Sato reactionary government.

　　中日友协等强烈谴责佐藤政府迫害日本进步团体的法西斯暴行
　　中国人民坚决支持日本革命人民的正义斗争
　　佐藤反动政府反华越凶失败就会越惨
    新华社讯　中国日本友好协会和中国国际贸易促进委员会，四日分别打电报给日中友协（正统）总部和日本国际贸易促进协会，强烈谴责日本佐藤反动政府十一月二十九日派出大批警察，悍然强行搜查日中友协（正统）总部、日本国际贸易促进协会和日中友协全国（正统）总部常任理事坂田辉昭住宅的法西斯暴行，坚决支持日本革命人民反美爱国的正义斗争。
    中日友协在电报中指出，日本佐藤反动政府这一法西斯暴行，是它一贯敌视中国、疯狂破坏中日友好运动和中日贸易的又一严重步骤，是对中日两国人民赤裸裸的政治挑衅。
    电报说，日中友协（正统）总部，高举中日友好旗帜，坚决反对美帝、苏修、日本反动派和日共修正主义集团这一伙反华小丑，坚决进行反美爱国正义斗争，为中日友好运动和民族民主运动作出了杰出的贡献。
    电报说，伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”你们的斗争完全是正义的，我们坚决拥护和支持。正义的斗争必胜！佐藤反华越凶，失败就会越惨，最终必将被人民的革命洪流彻底埋葬！用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，将永远同你们团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会在电报中指出，最近日本亲美卖国首相佐藤同美帝国主义头子约翰逊进行会谈，又勾引蒋贼经国去日本活动以后，对日本人民施行法西斯镇压绝不是偶然的。这是佐藤反动政府更加露骨地追随美帝，加紧反华，复活军国主义，推行法西斯政策的又一次大暴露。电报说，日本人民坚持反帝、反修、反对佐藤政府的正义斗争，是完全符合日本广大人民和亚洲人民的利益的。我们深信，日本革命人民在反美爱国正义斗争中，一定会取得最后的胜利。
    新华社东京电　日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏十一月三十日发表谈话，强烈抗议佐藤反动政府派出警察特务非法搜查和镇压为增进日中两国人民友好事业和发展日中友好贸易的日中友好协会（正统）总部和日本国际贸易促进协会。中岛在谈话中痛斥了日本反动当局为这次法西斯暴行而制造的卑劣的借口，并指出，十一月十二日在羽田机场抗议佐藤访美的群众行动，代表了日本人民的呼声和意志。中岛指出，这一暴行暴露了佐藤政府妄图彻底破坏日中两国关系，出卖日本神圣领土冲绳，把日本人民拉进追随美帝的侵略政策和战争政策的泥沼里去的丑恶面目。中岛表示要发动广大舆论，同佐藤反动政府野蛮的镇压行动进行坚决的斗争。
