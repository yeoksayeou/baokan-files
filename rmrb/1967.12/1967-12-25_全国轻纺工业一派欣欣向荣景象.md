The light industry and textile industry of China, which are responsible for producing daily necessities for urban and rural residents, have shown a thriving revolutionary scene. After more than a year of tempering and testing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers have never been as spirited and enthusiastic as they are now. They follow the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions of "developing the economy and ensuring supply" and "grasping the revolution and promoting production." They take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, thoroughly criticizing and repudiating the capitalist and revisionist line that China's Khrushchev and his agents have been promoting in the light industry and textile industry. They firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the "private" interest, and firmly establish the "public" interest. This has effectively promoted the revolutionization of the enterprises and workers' thoughts, and vigorously promoted the vigorous development of production.

In recent times, the light industry and textile industry front has been reporting continuous victories, with production booming. Many regions where light industry and textile industry are concentrated, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Shijiazhuang, Hangzhou, and other cities, have achieved revolutionary great unity in 80% to 90% of their light industry and textile factories. Many enterprises have established revolutionary committees with the "three-in-one combination," and more and more enterprises and regions have completed the state plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it. This year, the state has assigned the light industry workers the extremely important and glorious task of producing Chairman Mao's works and paper for printing Chairman Mao's portraits ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it. The production of red treasures—Chairman Mao's works with plastic covers, as well as the golden Mao badges, has also far exceeded the specified quotas, with production increasing by tens to hundreds of times compared to the past. Other daily necessities and cultural products, such as salt, clocks, toothpaste, synthetic detergents, eggs, alcohol, clothing, hats, daily hardware, leather products, ink, gold pens, and ballpoint pens, have all increased in production to varying degrees compared to last year.

The ship sails with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The achievements of China's light industry and textile industry this year are fundamentally due to the broad revolutionary workers holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of the PLA's support-left teams, they actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolution and production. Many factories, enterprises, workshops, and teams have established systems for reporting to Chairman Mao before and after shifts and meetings, bringing class struggle and production issues to Chairman Mao's works for consultation at any time, achieving immediate results. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the broad revolutionary workers' enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works has surged, and they have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes one after another. They are determined to use Mao Zedong Thought to lead everything, to be pioneers of the revolution, and models of production. Many factory revolutionary workers, at the most intense moments of the struggle between the two lines and two classes, have risked their personal safety to fight against a handful of capitalist roaders and ghosts and monsters, while firmly guarding their production posts, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

Since this year, the revolutionary workers of the light industry and textile industry across the country have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, launching a powerful revolutionary criticism movement. They have deeply exposed and systematically criticized the series of capitalist and revisionist black goods that China's Khrushchev and his agents have spread in the light industry and textile industry. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary workers' awareness has generally improved, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has deeply entered people's hearts, and the technical innovation and technological revolution movement has flourished, greatly promoting the development of the light industry and textile industry.

According to incomplete statistics, this year alone, the workers in the knitting industry have successfully experimented with more than 100 relatively major technical innovation projects. If these innovation projects are promoted nationwide, they will greatly change the production technology of China's knitting industry. In the past, only 18 paper mills could produce paper for printing Chairman Mao's works. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, the number of mills that could produce this type of paper increased to more than 100, covering all parts of the country. Some originally small mills with simple equipment and few people can now not only produce paper that fully meets the standards for printing Chairman Mao's works but also produce thin offset paper for printing the pocket-sized "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," which has higher technical requirements.

The broad revolutionary workers of the light industry and textile industry are seriously implementing Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China regions, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, bringing a vigorous revolutionary new situation to the light industry and textile industry. In factories that have achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, such as the Beijing Knitting Factory, Guiyang Cotton Textile Factory, Shanxi Hongwei Textile Factory, Beijing Dyeing Factory, Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9, Shanghai Ink Factory, Hebei Wu'an Paper Mill, Harbin Bicycle Factory, Beijing Clock Factory, and Beijing Shirt Factory, the broad revolutionary workers are spirited, and their enthusiasm is doubled. A new revolutionary order has been established, and everywhere there is a good atmosphere of unity, friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation. The originally cumbersome management structure has begun to be streamlined, and a new type of superior-subordinate relationship has been established between old and new cadres and the masses.

At present, the broad revolutionary workers of the light industry and textile industry are riding the mighty east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production. On the basis of striving to complete and overfulfill this year's plan, they are making all preparations to welcome the new leap in the light industry and textile industry that is about to come.

The broad revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, with the help of the support-left personnel of the 8341 Unit, have actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolution and production, achieving great results.

    毛泽东思想统帅革命和生产的伟大胜利
    全国轻纺工业一派欣欣向荣景象
    上海天津等城市百分之八十到九十的轻纺工业工厂实现革命大联合，不少企业建立了革委会，越来越多的企业和地区提前超额完成国家计划
    据新华社二十四日讯　担负城乡人民生活必需品生产任务的我国轻工业和纺织工业，出现了一派欣欣向荣的革命景象。广大革命职工经受了一年多无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验，从来没有象现在这样意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们遵循伟大领袖毛主席的“发展经济，保障供给”和“抓革命，促生产”的英明教导，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大破特破中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在轻纺工业中推行的资本主义和修正主义路线，大立毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，有力地促进了企业和职工思想的革命化，推动了生产的蓬勃发展。
    最近以来，全国轻工业和纺织工业战线捷报频传，生产蒸蒸日上。许多轻工业和纺织工业比较集中的地区，如上海、天津、广州、青岛、石家庄、杭州等城市，百分之八十到九十的轻工业和纺织工业的工厂都实现了革命的大联合，不少企业建立了“三结合”的革命委员会，越来越多的企业和地区提前超额完成了国家计划。今年国家交给轻工业职工的生产印制毛主席著作和毛主席像用纸的极其重要而光荣的战斗任务，已经提前超额完成；红色宝书毛主席著作的塑料封面，以及金光闪闪的毛主席像章等的生产，也都大大超过了规定的指标，产量比过去有成倍到成百倍的增长。其他人民生活用品和文化用品，如食盐、钟表、牙膏、合成洗涤剂、蛋品、酒、服装鞋帽、日用五金、皮革制品和油墨、金笔、圆珠笔等的产量，都比去年有不同程度的增长。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我国轻工业和纺织工业今年取得成就，最根本的原因是广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在解放军支左部队的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅了革命和生产。许多工厂、企业、车间、班组都建立了班前班后、会前会后向毛主席请示汇报的制度，带着阶级斗争和生产中的问题，随时随地向毛主席著作请教，收到了立竿见影的效果。毛主席提出“要斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号召以后，广大革命职工学习毛主席著作的热情更加高涨，纷纷办起了毛泽东思想学习班。他们决心要用毛泽东思想统帅一切，做革命的闯将，当生产的模范。许多工厂的革命职工在两条路线、两个阶级斗争最激烈的时刻，不顾个人安危，一面和一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神进行针锋相对的斗争，一面坚守生产岗位，取得了革命生产双胜利。
    今年以来，全国轻工业和纺织工业革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，开展了声势浩大的革命大批判运动，深入揭发和系统批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在轻工业、纺织工业中散布的一系列资本主义、修正主义黑货。通过革命大批判，广大革命职工觉悟普遍提高，毛主席的革命路线深入人心，技术革新和技术革命运动蓬勃发展，大大推动了轻工业、纺织工业的发展。
    据不完全统计，今年只是针织工业一个行业的职工，就试验成功一百多个比较重大的技术革新项目。这些革新项目如在全国推广，将极大地改变我国针织工业的生产技术面貌。造纸工业过去只有十八个纸厂能够生产印制毛主席著作的用纸，无产阶级革命派掌权以后，能够生产这种纸的工厂增加到了一百多个，遍及全国各地。有些原来设备简陋、人数很少的小厂，现在不但能够生产完全合乎标准的印制毛主席著作用纸，还能生产技术要求较高的印制《毛主席语录》袖珍本的薄型凸版纸等。
    轻工业和纺织工业广大革命职工认真执行毛主席视察华北、中南、华东地区时所作的重要指示，迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，为轻工业、纺织工业带来了生气勃勃的革命新气象。在实现了革命大联合和革命三结合的工厂，如北京针织总厂、贵阳棉纺织厂、山西红卫纺织厂、北京印染厂、青岛国棉九厂、上海油墨厂、河北武安造纸厂、哈尔滨自行车厂、北京钟厂、北京衬衫厂等，广大革命职工精神振奋，干劲倍增，新的革命秩序已经建立，到处出现了团结友爱，互助协作的良好空气。原来庞大臃肿的管理机构开始精简，新老干部和群众之间建立起了新型的上下级关系。
    目前，轻工业、纺织工业的广大革命职工，正在乘无产阶级文化大革命的浩荡东风，进一步狠抓革命，猛促生产，在争取完成和超额完成今年计划的基础上，作好一切准备，迎接即将到来的轻纺工业的新跃进。
    北京针织总厂的广大革命职工，在八三四一部队支左人员的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅革命和生产，取得了很大成绩。　（新华社发）
