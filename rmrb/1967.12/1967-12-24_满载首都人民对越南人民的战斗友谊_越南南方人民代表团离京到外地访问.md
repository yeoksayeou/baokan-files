The delegation led by Nguyen Van Long, Deputy Head Le Thi Chi, and Sam Loc, left Beijing this morning by special plane to visit other regions to participate in the activities celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and to conduct friendly visits.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, relevant officials Wang Xinting, Han Nianlong, and Niu Lianbi, as well as over 2,000 revolutionary masses from the capital, went to the airport to see them off.

The permanent representative of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Nguyen Van Quang, Counselor Le Chung Shi of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, and other Vietnamese comrades in Beijing also went to the airport to see them off.

The revolutionary masses from the capital who came to the airport to see them off held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, high portraits of the great leader of the Vietnamese people Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. They waved the national flags of the two countries and the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. When the Vietnamese comrades from the South arrived at the airport accompanied by Chen Yi and others, the people held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Victory to Vietnam! Defeat to American imperialism!" "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the fraternal friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!"

A group of Red Guards recited aloud a passage from the telegram sent by our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho:

"We firmly support you. Our two countries are neighboring countries that depend on each other. Our two peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. The fraternal people of South Vietnam and all the Vietnamese people can be assured that your struggle is our struggle. Seven hundred million Chinese people are the strong rear of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. In the face of the strong combat unity of our two peoples, any military adventure and political deception by American imperialism is doomed to fail.

Victory will certainly belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!"

At this moment, the entire crowd cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!" "Salute to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam!"

Ding Xilin and others accompanied the Vietnamese comrades from the South to visit other regions. Those who accompanied them included Deputy Head Nguyen Minh Phuong and member Le Songshan of the permanent representative office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China.

    满载首都人民对越南人民的战斗友谊
    越南南方人民代表团离京到外地访问
    新华社二十三日讯由团长阮春龙、副团长黎氏芝、山禄率领的越南南方人民代表团，今天上午满载首都人民对越南人民的战斗友情，分两路乘专机离开北京去外地参加庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年活动，并进行友好访问。
    国务院副总理陈毅，有关方面负责人王新亭、韩念龙、牛连璧等，以及首都革命群众两千多人，前往机场欢送。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆参赞黎终始，以及在北京的其他越南同志，也到机场送行。
    到机场欢送的首都革命群众，高举我们的伟大领袖毛主席像，高举越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席像和越南南方民族解放阵线阮友寿主席像，手擎中越两国国旗和越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜。当越南南方战友在陈毅等同志陪同下来到机场时，人们高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，不断高呼：“越南必胜！美帝必败！”“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”“中越两国人民的兄弟友谊和战斗团结万岁！”一群红卫兵小将向越南南方战友齐声朗读了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席致阮友寿主席的贺电中的一段话：
    “我们坚决支持你们。我们两国是唇齿相依的邻邦。我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。在我们两国人民坚强的战斗团结面前，美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗都是注定要失败的。
    胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民！”
    这时，全场欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“胡志明主席万岁！”“向以阮友寿主席为首的越南南方民族解放阵线致敬！”
    丁西林等分别陪同越南南方战友前往外地。分别陪同前往的，还有越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团副团长阮明芳和团员黎松山。
