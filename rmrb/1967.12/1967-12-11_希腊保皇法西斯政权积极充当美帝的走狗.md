The Greek royalist fascist regime, which came to power through a military coup half a year ago, is actively serving as the U.S. imperialist's running dog in the Mediterranean. Internally, it is brutally suppressing Greek democratic forces, and externally, it is clamoring to annex Cyprus and even arrogantly making territorial demands on Albania, attempting to invade the great socialist beacon of Europe.

Recently, under the instigation of the U.S., the Greek fascist authorities have repeatedly conducted military exercises in the regions south of the Albanian border. The Greek navy, under the command of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, has also conducted landing exercises in the Aegean Sea, attempting to threaten the People's Republic of Albania. Some ambitious Greek royalist fascists have even brazenly made territorial demands on Albania.

The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, has already issued a stern warning to the U.S., the Soviet revisionists, and the Greek fascist authorities. The Chinese government and the Chinese people firmly support Albania's principled stance. If the Greek fascist authorities dare to attack Albania, the Chinese people will be the steadfast rear guard of the Albanian people.

The Greek fascist regime has made no secret of its ambition to annex the Republic of Cyprus. During his visit to the Cypriot capital of Nicosia in August, the coup leader Papadopoulos repeatedly declared that the unification of Cyprus with Greece is the only "acceptable solution" to the Cypriot problem. Recently, the Greek fascist regime has instructed its agents, the commander of the Greek expeditionary forces in Cyprus, Grivas, to use artillery and machine guns to massacre Turkish Cypriot residents, severely worsening the situation in Cyprus and paving the way for further U.S. imperialist and United Nations interference in Cyprus.

On April 21 of this year, a reactionary military coup took place in Greece. With the support of U.S. tanks and bayonets, the Greek right-wing military took power and imposed naked fascist rule on the Greek people, brutally suppressing the people's struggle for democratic rights. It ordered the dissolution of all political parties and over 300 mass organizations, banned gatherings of more than five people, closed numerous newspapers, expelled editors, and prohibited publications from expressing anti-U.S. and anti-government views. It established military courts and concentration camps everywhere, arresting people on trumped-up charges such as "opposing the state" and "distributing subversive pamphlets" across the country. The head of the secret police and Greek Interior Minister, Patakos, openly admitted to arresting 6,500 people, while the U.S. "Newsweek" magazine estimated that the actual number of arrests was over 45,000. Prisons and concentration camps are filled with Greek patriots who are subjected to severe torture and cruel persecution.

The extremely reactionary internal and external policies pursued by the Greek fascist regime over the past half year have all been supported by U.S. imperialism. The April coup itself was the result of a U.S. imperialist plot. It is revealed that the action plan for the April coup, known as the "Prometheus Plan," was jointly drafted by the Greek General Staff and the NATO headquarters in Athens, which is controlled by the U.S. U.S. Congressman Don Edwards also admitted in the House of Representatives that Americans had encouraged the Greek military to seize power. The Greek right-wing officers were eager to declare their allegiance to the U.S. the day after the coup and begged for more military and economic aid from the U.S.

The reactionary rule of the Greek fascist regime is sparking increasing resistance from the Greek people. On the day after the coup, anti-coup leaflets appeared on the streets of Athens. Greek patriotic youth, defying the threat of "shooting on the spot," wrote slogans against U.S. imperialism and fascist rule on the walls of streets and alleys. In the concentration camps, Greek patriots resolutely refused to sign the surrender documents pledging loyalty to the "government" and promising not to engage in political activities again. The head of the secret police, Patakos, who had publicly declared, "Whoever does not sign will be imprisoned for a hundred years," was forced to admit by the end of August that many political prisoners in the concentration camps were "unshakable."

The fascist bloody rule has educated the Greek people. More and more people are gradually realizing the serious consequences of the revisionist path taken by the Greek Communist Party, which has led the people astray with its "peaceful transition" and "parliamentary road" illusions. They are rallying around the true Marxist-Leninists in Greece, raising the banner of revolution, and fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed Greek traitorous dictatorship.

　　希腊保皇法西斯政权积极充当美帝的走狗
    到处设立军事法庭和集中营，疯狂镇压民主力量，公然叫嚷侵犯阿尔巴尼亚领土并吞并塞浦路斯
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：半年前通过军事政变上台的希腊保皇法西斯政权，积极充当美帝在地中海的走狗，对内疯狂镇压希腊民主力量，对外叫嚷要并吞塞浦路斯，甚至狂妄地向阿尔巴尼亚提出领土要求，妄想侵犯欧洲伟大的社会主义的明灯。
    不久前，希腊法西斯当局在美帝唆使下，一再在阿尔巴尼亚边境以南地区进行军事演习，希腊海军也在美国第六舰队的指挥下在爱琴海进行登陆演习，企图威胁阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。一些野心勃勃的希腊保皇法西斯分子甚至放肆地对阿尔巴尼亚提出领土要求。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志已经对美帝、苏修和希腊法西斯当局提出严正警告。中国政府和中国人民表示坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚的严正立场。如果希腊法西斯当局胆敢进攻阿尔巴尼亚，中国人民誓作阿尔巴尼亚人民的坚强后盾。
    希腊法西斯政权毫不掩饰它并吞塞浦路斯共和国的野心，政变头目帕帕多普洛斯八月间到塞浦路斯首都尼科西亚活动时就曾一再叫嚷，塞浦路斯同希腊合并是解决塞浦路斯问题唯一“可接受的办法”。最近，希腊法西斯政权指使它的走卒，希腊驻塞浦路斯远征军总司令格里瓦斯使用大炮、机关枪屠杀塞浦路斯土耳其族居民，使塞浦路斯局势严重恶化，从而为美帝国主义和联合国进一步干涉塞浦路斯开辟了道路。
    今年四月二十一日，希腊发生了反动的军事政变。希腊右派军人在美国坦克和刺刀的支持下上台后，对希腊人民实行赤裸裸的法西斯统治，疯狂镇压劳动人民争取民主权利的斗争。它下令解散了所有政党和三百多个群众组织，禁止五人以上的集会；它封闭大批报纸，放逐编辑人员，禁止报刊发表反美和反对政府的言论；它到处设立军事法庭和集中营，以“反对国家”，“散发颠覆性小册子”等莫须有罪名，在全国各地大肆进行逮捕。特务头子、希腊内政大臣帕塔科斯公开承认逮捕了六千五百人，美国《新闻周刊》认为实际逮捕数字在四万五千人以上。监狱和集中营充满了希腊爱国者，他们受到严刑拷打，残酷迫害。
    希腊法西斯政权半年多以来推行的极端反动的对内对外政策，都受到美帝国主义的支持。今年四月的政变本身就是美帝国主义阴谋策划的结果。据透露，四月政变的行动计划——所谓“普罗米修斯计划”，是希腊总参谋部和美国控制的北大西洋集团雅典总部共同拟定的。美国议员唐·爱德华兹在众议院中也承认，美国人曾鼓励希腊军方夺取政权。而希腊右派军官也迫不及待地在政变的第二天就发表声明，表示效忠美国，并乞求美国给予更多的军事和经济援助。
    希腊法西斯政权的反动统治正激起希腊人民越来越大的反抗。在政变的第二天，雅典街头就出现反对政变的传单。希腊青年爱国者蔑视“就地枪决”的威胁，在大街小巷的墙头上奋笔大书反对美帝国主义、反对法西斯统治的标语。在集中营里，希腊爱国者坚决拒绝在效忠“政府”、“不再参加政治活动”的投降书上签字。曾经公开叫嚷“谁不签字就关他一百年”的特务头子帕塔科斯，八月底也无可奈何地承认，集中营里许多政治犯是“不可动摇的”。
    法西斯的血腥统治教育了希腊人民，越来越多的人逐步认识了醉心于“和平过渡”、“议会道路”的希共修正主义分子把人民引入歧途所造成的严重后果。他们正在希腊真正的马克思列宁主义者的周围团结起来，高举革命的旗帜，为推翻美帝国主义扶植的希腊卖国独裁政权而斗争。
