The historical tide, following the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, surges forward with a roar!

The ship of the Cultural Revolution, closely following the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, sails through the waves and advances triumphantly!

The radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the Beijing Textile Factory. The workers joyously sing:

The red sun shines on the textile factory,
Chairman Mao's kindness is like the ocean,
The People's Liberation Army comes as kin,
Bringing the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought.
Revolutionary classics are read daily,
The direction of the struggle is grasped.
Revolution in the depths of the soul,
The power of criticizing and repudiating revisionism is strong.
A new sky, new earth, new appearance,
New people, new things, new thoughts.
Ten thousand songs cannot exhaust the praise,
Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

The red sun rises in the heart

In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing Textile Factory, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overcame numerous difficulties and dangers, surged through countless waves, and achieved one victory after another.

In June of this year, Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army.

Upon the arrival of the support-left personnel from the 8341 Unit, they vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, conducted in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work, and enthusiastically introduced the good experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The entire factory launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has never been so deeply rooted in people's hearts.

People still vividly remember that before the Cultural Revolution, revolutionary workers, filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, requested to hang two banners reading "Long Live Chairman Mao" and "Long Live the Communist Party" on the wall of the office building. A small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory maliciously slandered these two banners as "affecting the factory's appearance" and refused to allow them to be hung.

Now, from the conference rooms to the workshops, from the offices to the dormitories, Chairman Mao's great image inspires people to press forward, and Chairman Mao's quotations shine with golden light everywhere!

People still vividly remember that before the Cultural Revolution, the former Beijing Municipal Committee, a counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, maliciously promoted the "self-selected time, self-chosen content, voluntary participation, free association" black goods in the factory, doing everything possible to sabotage and resist the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Instead, they forced the workers to study the poisonous weed "Black Cultivation," ordering them to learn it, attempting to lead the workers down the revisionist path.

Now, studying Chairman Mao's books is truly placed in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. Everyone insists on daily study, deeply studying, reciting, and applying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the workshops, offices, dining halls, and dormitories, study groups for Mao Zedong Thought are blooming everywhere. All revolutionary workers in the factory read the "Three Constantly Read Articles" daily, recite the "Three Constantly Read Sections," and sing the "Three Songs." The broad revolutionary workers consciously regard studying Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics as the top priority.

Every day before work, the workers' first task is to gather in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, reporting to Chairman Mao: regarding the day's work, combined with their actual thoughts, they study Chairman Mao's quotations, and with Chairman Mao's teachings, they go to their workstations.

The day's work begins. Each person's workstation has a "dashboard" with Chairman Mao's quotations, constantly injecting wisdom and strength.

The shift bell rings, and everyone gathers in front of Chairman Mao's portrait again, reporting to Chairman Mao: with Chairman Mao's teachings as the highest standard, they review the day's thoughts and work.

The deputy heads of the revolutionary committee, Xing Yunhe and He Genlin, from over a year of sharp and complex class struggle, have a deeper understanding: Chairman Mao's books are treasures of revolution, our strongest ideological weapon, and the lifeblood of the working class. They said that it was Chairman Mao's teachings: "The essence of Marxism-Leninism is summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" that inspired them to bravely rebel against the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party. It was Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, raise our courage." that inspired them to bravely charge out from under the white terror of the capitalist reactionary line. Under Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," they studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and achieved revolutionary great unity. Whether or not to study Chairman Mao's works, whether or not to listen to Chairman Mao's words, is a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Studying Chairman Mao's books, the red sun shines in the heart, making one clear-sighted and able to move forward forever!

Zhang Shuqin, a reeler who was once deceived by the capitalist reactionary line, deeply felt from her personal experience: Doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought!

Zhang Shuqin started working for a capitalist at the age of ten, became a child laborer at thirteen, and it was Chairman Mao who saved her from the bitter sea of the old society. She harbored deep class feelings for Chairman Mao. However, in the past, due to not studying Chairman Mao's works well, she was poisoned by the black "Cultivation" and harmed by China's Khrushchev's "tame tool" theory. She said painfully: "Without Chairman Mao's books, one cannot distinguish right from wrong, good from bad. China's Khrushchev wanted to drag us back to the old society, suffer twice, and we were still in the dark. To truly be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, one must study Chairman Mao's books well. Otherwise, one will fall into the enemy's trap."

Now, Zhang Shuqin loves Chairman Mao even more and studies Chairman Mao's works even more diligently. She also educates her children to read Chairman Mao's books. Her eleven-year-old son, Chun Jing, often leads his three younger siblings to study Chairman Mao's works. Chun Jing can now recite the "Three Constantly Read Articles." Every evening after dinner, the whole family stands in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, wishing Chairman Mao a long life, and studies Chairman Mao's quotations. They also often hold "family criticism and repudiation of revisionism meetings."

The broad revolutionary workers, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, eagerly study Chairman Mao's works. The radiant Mao Zedong Thought illuminates every corner of the factory and shines into the hearts of every revolutionary worker. The Beijing Textile Factory has become a new world shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the garment workshop's parts storage room, there are seven workers, including the old worker Song Qing, and the rest are women workers with children. In the past, they came to work and left without much study.

The People's Liberation Army has entered the factory. Support-left personnel Xiao Zhao Hong went deep into this small storage room, had heart-to-heart talks with each of them, and studied Chairman Mao's works together. The parts storage room changed. Before work, everyone first studies Chairman Mao's quotations. During breaks, they sing Mao Zedong Thought songs. Every day, they seize the time to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles."

The dew of Mao Zedong Thought moistens everyone's hearts. Their spiritual outlook has undergone a profound change. In the past, if your child was naughty, or if a couple had a quarrel, it was often the center of conversation in this small world. Now, everyone is concerned about national affairs and discusses ideological revolutionization. In the past, if there was a little more work, they would divide it among themselves. Now, they care for and help each other. When the small group's work is done, they go to the workshop to help with auxiliary work. When Chairman Mao issued the order for revolutionary great unity, they acted immediately, first achieving small group great unity, and first publishing a revolutionary criticism column in the name of the small group collective.

The transformation of the parts storage room reflects the profound changes in the Beijing Textile Factory.

The Beijing Textile Factory has raised the eternal red sun!

Advancing on the great road of Mao Zedong Thought

A red sun rises in the heart, and the broad revolutionary masses consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions, step by step following the great leader Chairman Mao, moving from victory to victory.

On September 14th, a spring thunder echoed across the land. Chairman Mao issued the order for revolutionary great unity:

"Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions."

"Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do! Wherever Chairman Mao points, we follow!"

The support-left personnel of the 8341 Unit and the revolutionary mass organizations together, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, spread Chairman Mao's great order throughout the factory. In the workshops, offices, dining halls, and dormitories, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are posted everywhere. Large meetings, small meetings, before and after shifts, repeatedly study. Chairman Mao's latest instructions stir the hearts of every revolutionary worker.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing Textile Factory, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, engaged in a head-on struggle with the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, making significant contributions. However, after seizing power, due to the influence of the capitalist reactionary line and bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, a factory-wide proletarian revolutionary organization split into the "Red Rebels" and "East is Red" factions. The two factions were busy with "internal war," attacking each other. Close class brothers seemed to have become enemies, and comrades-in-arms who had fought side by side almost became sworn enemies.

After the support-left personnel of the People's Liberation Army entered the factory, they studied Chairman Mao's works with them, guiding them to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Many revolutionary masses expressed a strong desire to achieve revolutionary great unity.

Chairman Mao's order for revolutionary great unity came down! Revolutionary masses expressed: We will definitely carry it out, word for word!

Bai Xishan, one of the leaders of the "Red Rebels," originally thought that uniting with "East is Red" was "surrender" and that "East is Red" could only be overthrown, not united. Now, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the knots in his mind were untied. He said:

"Chairman Mao is right, within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. The 'Red Rebels' and 'East is Red' are class brothers who have fought side by side, and they can only unite, not split."

A few "Red Rebels" who had not yet understood asked Bai Xishan: "If we unite with 'East is Red' like this, does it conform to the principles?"

Bai Xishan excitedly said: "Listening to Chairman Mao's words is the greatest principle!"

The "Red Guard Group 1" in the maintenance workshop was the first to split from the "Red Rebels." After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they decided to contribute to the achievement of revolutionary great unity throughout the factory. But they were afraid of being ridiculed: those who split are you, and those who unite are you again. After a discussion, they thought that fearing ridicule was selfishness, and listening to Chairman Mao's words was the most important. They resolutely executed Chairman Mao's order, which is a basic quality that proletarian revolutionaries must possess. They boldly posted the first big-character poster advocating revolutionary great unity throughout the factory.

Supporting and responding big-character posters quickly filled the entire factory.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions mobilized the broad revolutionary masses. On September 19th, the support-left personnel convened a meeting of the leaders of the two factions to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions again.

After the meeting, "East is Red" decided: to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, immediately write a proposal for revolutionary great unity.

"The Red Rebels" decided: to follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "seizing the day," take immediate action.

That night, the lights were on. The leaders of the "Red Rebels" led the fighters, carrying Chairman Mao's portrait, holding red flags, and beating drums and gongs to the support-left unit and the "East is Red" headquarters, delivering the big-character poster of their determination to achieve revolutionary great unity. The leaders of "East is Red" quickly stepped forward. The hands of the worker brothers were tightly clasped together!

Revolutionary great unity was achieved throughout the factory, and the Revolutionary Great Unity Committee of the proletarian revolutionary faction was established.

The broad revolutionary workers of the Beijing Textile Factory sang another triumphant song of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment!

Chairman Mao's words represent the fundamental interests of the working class. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Textile Factory understand and execute Chairman Mao's instructions, even if they do not understand them temporarily, they will definitely execute them, and deepen their understanding in the process of execution. They say: "Whether or not to execute Chairman Mao's instructions is not a matter of level, but a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao."

During the days of achieving revolutionary great unity throughout the factory following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, the young female worker Hao Guirong had not yet understood some specific issues. However, with her unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, she firmly followed Chairman Mao's words, resolutely executed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and actively contributed to the achievement of revolutionary great unity throughout the factory. On the day of achieving revolutionary great unity throughout the factory, she fought at the broadcasting station, broadcasting the good news from various units with a loud and enthusiastic voice. After achieving revolutionary great unity, she did not say anything against great unity and did not do anything against great unity.

After achieving revolutionary great unity, Hao Guirong saw with her own eyes that the entire factory praised the benefits of revolutionary great unity everywhere, denounced the crimes of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism everywhere. Criticizing and repudiating revisionism was done with great enthusiasm, and people's spiritual outlook was completely renewed. Workers were full of energy, and production reports were frequent. Hao Guirong understood Chairman Mao's latest instructions more and more. She excitedly said: "Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Now I have completely understood, revolutionary great unity is good!"

Revolution in the depths of the soul

Just as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was achieving decisive victories nationwide, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao issued a new battle order: "Criticize and repudiate revisionism."

This is the fundamental policy to ensure the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Textile Factory enthusiastically support this great instruction and resolutely execute it.

A dyer said: "A drop of ink can pollute a pot of clear water; a bit of selfishness can corrupt a person's soul."

An inspector said: "'Selfishness' is like a flaw on a finished product. No matter how big or small it is, once you see it, you must grab it and not let it go!"

A cleaner said: "'Selfishness' is like garbage on the ground, like oil on the machine, it must be thoroughly cleaned out."

A campaign of "people's war" to criticize and repudiate revisionism has been launched in the Beijing Textile Factory!

One after another Mao Zedong Thought study classes with "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline have been set up in the factory, in collective dormitories, and in residential areas.

One after another Mao Zedong Thought study and application meetings with "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the center have been held throughout the factory, in workshops, and in workers' families.

The revolutionary torrent of criticizing and repudiating revisionism surges through every corner, touching the soul of every person.

The young worker Liu Wenliang is a young fighter who came out from under the white terror of the capitalist reactionary line. When he first came to the Mao Zedong Thought study class, he thought he was mainly there to help others, and that he had no "selfishness" to criticize.

Is there really no "selfishness"? Under the help of the support-left personnel of the People's Liberation Army, he studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Constantly Read Articles," strictly examined himself, and found that many places did not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that his mind was not without "selfishness," but full of it, and compared to the shining images of Zhang Zedong and Bai Qiu'en, he was far behind.

Facing his own "selfishness," what should he do? Should he hide it, passively defend, or expose it, actively attack? Liu Wenliang's mind was in turmoil. He was afraid that if he exposed his selfishness, he would be looked down upon, and as the deputy leader of the workshop service group, he would not be able to do work for the masses; he was also afraid that he would be caught by the "tail" by the comrades of the other faction, and wanted to see how others would react first.

Liu Wenliang, this descendant of workers, originally named Liu Lian Sheng, changed his name to express his determination to be a pioneer of the Cultural Revolution. Now that he is about to revolutionize himself, can he still be a pioneer? Liu Wenliang repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "criticize and repudiate revisionism" and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions: "Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. Without revolutionizing oneself, this revolution cannot be done well."

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought pointed out the road of ideological revolutionization to Liu Wenliang. He increasingly deeply realized that "selfishness" is the core of the bourgeois worldview and the root of producing revisionism. Only by fiercely criticizing "selfishness" can one be forever loyal to Chairman Mao and be a good servant of the people.

Liu Wenliang decided to launch an offensive battle against "selfishness," and spark a revolution in the depths of his soul. He was the first to completely expose his selfishness to all the comrades in the Mao Zedong Thought study class and fiercely criticize it. People said: "The pioneer has launched the first attack on 'selfishness' again!"

Liu Wenliang returned to the workshop and exposed and criticized his selfishness in front of the masses. He said with deep feelings: Carrying the burden of "selfishness," one cannot move forward and cannot closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Daring or not daring to criticize "selfishness" is a sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, a sign of whether one is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary.

The surging torrent of criticizing and repudiating revisionism washed away the thoughts of Zhang Chengming, who was born into a poor peasant family and was the former deputy director of the factory.

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, Zhang Chengming executed the capitalist reactionary line and was attacked by the masses. He did not understand, was not convinced in his heart, and was stubborn in his actions, even feeling that being an official was "unlucky and miserable," vowing never to be an official again.

In the first Mao Zedong Thought study class, Zhang Chengming repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Investigation Report on the Peasant Movement in Hunan," gradually realizing his mistakes. However, he was not willing to completely expose his "selfishness," fearing that if he spoke too heavily, it would be too high-level, and if he spoke lightly, the masses would not pass it.

Zhang Chengming's mind was in turmoil, and he could not sleep well for several nights. He picked up the revolutionary classic "Three Constantly Read Articles," studying during the day and reading at night, sometimes lying in bed, his mind still playing the "movie" of heroic images: Zhang Zedong sacrificed himself for the people's interests; Bai Qiu'en, to support the Chinese revolution, was selfless and dedicated to others. And himself? In the movement, he suffered a little impact and lay down, not doing anything. What kind of thinking was this? This was individualistic thinking. The more he thought about it, the more he felt he had wronged Chairman Mao and the party. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese Communists, who take the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people as their starting point, believe that their cause is completely just, and are willing to sacrifice everything for their cause, including their lives. Is there any thought, viewpoint, opinion, or method that does not conform to the needs of the people and is reluctant to give up?" The warm teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao deeply touched Zhang Chengming's soul: He clearly had mistakes, why was he still reluctant to completely give them up? Zhang Chengming decided to launch an annihilation battle against "selfishness." In the factory-wide workers' meeting, he made a deep self-criticism of his selfish thoughts and wrong actions.

To thoroughly annihilate "selfishness," he followed Chairman Mao's teachings, went to the masses, from one workshop to another, walked through the entire factory, listened to the masses' criticisms, and sought the masses' help. The more criticism he received, the more he sought it out, and the more he was attacked, the more he sought it out.

The old worker Wang Dianzong, who had severely criticized Zhang Chengming, saw Zhang Chengming's transformation and was very happy. He spoke to him with deep feelings: "We hated your mistakes in the past. We are like iron that has not been tempered into steel. In the future, you should work with the broad revolutionary masses, follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution!"

The burning class feelings warmed and inspired Zhang Chengming. He said with tears of excitement: "It was Chairman Mao who saved me, and it was my class brothers who saved me! The golden key of Mao Zedong Thought has opened this old rusty lock for me."

When the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Textile Factory was established, Zhang Chengming was elected as the deputy head of the Revolutionary Committee. Now, he is actively working with the broad revolutionary masses to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, contributing his strength to building the entire factory into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

The new world of Mao Zedong Thought

The waves of the Cultural Revolution are washing away the dirt and mud of the Beijing Textile Factory!

The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the bright future of the Beijing Textile Factory!

With the surging forward of the great revolutionary situation, a hot production new high tide has appeared in the Beijing Textile Factory!

No water flows without a source, no yarn is spun without cotton. The new surge in production at the Beijing Textile Factory comes from the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought.

Next to each machine is a small shift handover book, a historical witness to the factory's profound changes.

The small clique of capitalist roaders within the factory advocated "managing the economy with economic methods." When they were in power, the first thing written in the small shift handover book was production, the second was production, and the third was still production. Behind this "everything for production," the poison of revisionism was spreading, and the shift handover book became a tool for the small clique of capitalist roaders to promote "material incentives" and "bonus-based management."

Now, the proletarian revolutionary faction has seized power. The sky is Mao Zedong Thought's sky; the earth is Mao Zedong Thought's earth. This small shift handover book has also become a battlefield for studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

Walking into the warp-knitting workshop, randomly flipping through a few shift handover records, a warm current of air rushes towards you.

"Today, the machine is very easy to operate, with no problems, few pressure heads, and the edge yarn does not break easily. In short, everything is smooth. I wish you smooth sailing! Finally, let us jointly study the highest directive: 'We should be humble, cautious, guard against arrogance, guard against impatience, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people....'"

"The highest directive: 'All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must not relax their fighting will in the slightest. Any thought of relaxing the fighting will and any thought of underestimating the enemy are wrong.' Today, when I took over the machine, it was originally very easy to operate. Due to not following Chairman Mao's teachings, I had the thought of 'underestimating the enemy,' resulting in two pressure heads running away, causing two defects. I hope your shift learns from my shift's lesson and prevents the 'enemy' from taking advantage!"

"Today, the machine is running normally, but when dealing with pressure heads, the warping caused many pressure yarns. At that time, I thought not to deal with it and let your shift say it. Later, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly for the interests of the people.' Using the two measures of 'completely' and 'thoroughly,' I felt that I did not do enough. I should be like Comrade Zhang Zedong, 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serve the people. Thus, I made up my mind to deal with all the pressure yarns. Finally, let us jointly study the highest directive: 'In the world, fear only the word 'serious.' The Communist Party is the most serious about 'serious.''"

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought commands production and unleashes tremendous power.

The realization of joint operation of the knitting workshop's flatbed group is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

On a day in mid-October, the knitting workshop's flatbed group C shift had already finished work at half-past ten at night. They spontaneously gathered together and once again seriously studied Chairman Mao's great directive on "grab revolution, promote production."

Everyone's mind simultaneously appeared with a question: Now, the group's tasks are heavy, and there are few people. Each person does their own thing, the efficiency is low, and there are still some idle flatbeds in the workshop. The warehouse has plenty of yarn, but more cloth cannot be woven out. What should be done?

"Let's operate jointly!"

Someone said a sentence that hit the hearts of everyone. "Joint operation is good!" Several people shouted in unison. There were also some who hesitated: "In the past, joint operation was also tried, but it was not long before it was abandoned."

Yes, before the Cultural Revolution, the flatbed group had tried joint operation. Under the illumination of the three red banners of the general line, the great leap forward, and the people's communes, the workers proactively proposed to change individual responsibility for operating a few machines to small group collective joint operation and boldly carried out the experiment. However, because joint operation and the revisionist line of "individual prominence," "quota-based management," and "bonus-based management" promoted by the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party were fundamentally opposed, they were initially uninterested and later sabotaged it. Thus, a young sapling was strangled to death by the counter-revolutionary revisionist line!

Thinking of the past, it more inspired everyone's hatred of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and more determined their resolve to break with the old and establish the new. They decided to break through the revisionist framework and create a new world shining with Mao Zedong Thought. They said: "We implement Chairman Mao's call to 'criticize and repudiate revisionism,' and the ideological foundation for realizing joint operation is completely in place!"

The joint operation of the knitting workshop's flatbed group C shift was realized!

The support-left personnel of the People's Liberation Army, beating drums and gongs, came to the flatbed group C shift, congratulating the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They then went to other shifts to spread the good news of the C shift's realization of joint operation. Joint operation was quickly promoted in other shifts. The flatbed group presented a new atmosphere of unity and mutual assistance, taking on heavy responsibilities. The originally idle flatbeds were all started up, greatly increasing production. The workers said: "Realizing joint operation, we are more united, and collective spirit is stronger. Everyone thinks of operating for socialism, operating for the world revolution."

Joint operation—this brilliant red flower, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, grows vigorously!

A high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation is surging in the Beijing Textile Factory; one new thing after another emerges from various workshops.

We are doing the extremely glorious and great work that our predecessors have never done.

Our goal must be achieved.

Our goal will definitely be achieved.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing Textile Factory is determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, following the revolutionary course opened by the great leader Chairman Mao, and with great revolutionary spirit, write a new chapter in history!

    红太阳照亮了北京针织总厂
    历史的洪流，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，奔腾呼啸，滚滚向前！
    无产阶级文化大革命的航船，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，乘风破浪，凯歌猛进！
    毛泽东思想的灿烂阳光，照亮了北京针织总厂。职工们纵情高唱：
    红太阳照亮针织厂，毛主席恩情象海洋，
    派来亲人解放军，带来光辉的毛泽东思想。
    革命宝书天天读，掌握斗争大方向。
    灵魂深处闹革命，斗私批修威力强。
    新天新地新风貌，新人新事新思想。
    千歌万曲唱不尽，祝福毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
        	心中升起了红太阳
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，北京针织总厂的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜了种种艰难险阻，闯过了重重惊涛骇浪，取得了一个又一个胜利。
    今年六月，毛主席派来了亲人解放军。
    八三四一部队支左人员一到厂，就大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，热情介绍活学活用毛主席著作的好经验。全厂掀起了轰轰烈烈的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，从来没有象今天这样深入人心。
    人们还清楚地记得，在文化大革命前，革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，要求在办公大楼的墙上，挂上“毛主席万岁”、“共产党万岁”两条标语。工厂党内一小撮走资派，竟恶毒地污蔑这两条标语“影响厂容”，硬是不许悬挂。
    现在，从会议室到厂房，从办公室到宿舍，毛主席的伟大形象处处鼓舞着人们奋发向前，毛主席的语录处处闪耀着金色的光芒！
    人们还清楚地记得，在文化大革命前，旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，恶毒地在厂里推销“自找时间，自选内容，自愿参加，自由结合”的黑货，千方百计地破坏和抗拒活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。却把大毒草黑《修养》硬塞到工人手里，勒令学习，妄图把工人引向修正主义的邪路。
    现在，读毛主席的书，真正放到了高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。大家坚持天天读，大学、大背、大讲、大用“老三篇”，活学活用毛主席的各项最新指示。车间里，科室里，食堂里，宿舍里，毛主席著作学习小组遍地开花。全厂革命职工，天天读“老三篇”，天天背“老三段”，天天唱“三支歌”。广大革命职工，自觉地把学习毛主席的革命宝书，当作头等大事。
    每天上班前，职工们做的第一件事，就是集合在毛主席像前，向毛主席请示：针对当天工作，结合思想实际，学习毛主席语录，带着毛主席的教导，走上工作岗位。
    一天的工作开始了。各人的工作岗位上挂着“车头镜”，上面写着毛主席语录，随时随地给他们灌注智慧，增添力量。
    下班铃响了，大家又集合在毛主席像前，向毛主席汇报：以毛主席的教导为最高标准，检查一天的思想和工作。
    总厂革命委员会副主任邢云有和贺根林，从一年多来尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，更加深切地体会到：毛主席的书，是革命的宝，是我们最强大的思想武器，是工人阶级的命根子。他们说，是毛主席的教导：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”鼓舞我们勇敢地造了党内一小撮走资派的反。是毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”鼓舞着我们从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下，勇敢地冲杀出来。在毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召下，学习了“老三篇”，克服了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，实现了革命的大联合。学不学毛主席著作，听不听毛主席的话，是忠于不忠于毛主席的革命大节问题。学了毛主席的书，红太阳照到心坎里，就会心明眼亮，就能永远向前！
    曾经一度受了资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的倒纱女工张淑琴，从自己的亲身经历中深深体会到：干革命靠毛泽东思想！
    张淑琴十岁给资本家看孩子，十三岁给资本家当童工，是毛主席把她从旧社会的苦海中救了出来。她对毛主席怀着深厚的阶级感情。但是，过去由于没有很好学习毛主席著作，中了黑《修养》的毒，受了中国赫鲁晓夫“驯服工具”论的害。她沉痛地说：“离开了毛主席的书，就分不清是非，分不清香花毒草。中国赫鲁晓夫要把我们拉回到旧社会，吃二遍苦，自己还蒙在鼓里。要真正做到无限忠于毛主席，就必须好好读毛主席的书。不然，就会上敌人的当。”
    现在，张淑琴更加热爱毛主席，更加认真刻苦地学习毛主席著作。她还教育自己的孩子要读毛主席的书。十一岁的大男孩春静经常领着三个弟妹学习毛主席著作。春静现在已经能背诵“老三篇”。每天吃过晚饭，全家就站到毛主席像前，祝毛主席万寿无疆，学毛主席语录。他们全家还经常开“家庭斗私批修会”。
    广大革命职工，怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级感情，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。光芒万丈的毛泽东思想，照亮了工厂的每个角落，照射到每个革命职工的心坎里。北京针织总厂，变成了闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的新天地。
    成衣车间的零件库，有七位工人，除了老工人宋清以外，都是有孩子的女工。过去，他们上班来，下班走，很少学习。
    解放军进厂了。支左人员夏兆鸿，深入到这个小库房里，和他们一个个地促膝谈心，和他们一起学习毛主席著作。零件库变样了。上班前，大家先学毛主席语录。休息时，高唱毛主席语录歌。每天都抓紧时间学习“老三篇”。
    毛泽东思想的甘露，滋润着每个人的心田。他们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。过去，你家孩子调皮，他家夫妻吵架，常常是这个小天地里的谈话中心。如今，大家关心的是国家大事，谈论的是思想革命化。过去，工作多一点，也要分一分你的我的。现在，互相关心，互相帮助。小组里工作做完了，就到车间里帮助干辅助活。毛主席发出了革命大联合的号令，他们闻风而动，第一个实现了小组大联合，第一个以小组的集体名义出了革命大批判专栏。
    零件库的变迁，反映了北京针织总厂翻天覆地的深刻变化。
    北京针织总厂升起了永远不落的红太阳！	    前进在毛泽东思想的大道上
    一轮红日在心中升起，广大革命群众自觉地用毛泽东思想指挥自己的行动，步步紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，从胜利走向胜利。
    九月十四日，一声春雷响彻大地。毛主席发出了革命大联合的号令：
    “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”
    “毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做！”“毛主席指到那里，我们就跟到那里！”
    八三四一部队支左人员和革命群众组织一起，用最大的热情，最快的速度，在全厂传播毛主席的伟大号令。车间里，办公室里，食堂里，宿舍里，到处张贴着毛主席的最新指示。大会讲，小会议，班前班后反复学习。毛主席的最新指示，激动着每个革命职工的心。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，北京针织总厂的无产阶级革命派紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，同党内一小撮走资派进行了针锋相对的斗争，做出了重大贡献。但是，在夺权以后，由于资产阶级反动路线和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的影响，一个全厂性的无产阶级革命派组织，分裂成为“红色造反者”和“东方红”两大派组织。两派忙于“内战”，互相攻击。亲密无间的阶级兄弟，仿佛成了仇人，并肩战斗过的战友，几乎成了冤家。
    解放军支左人员进厂后，同他们一起学习毛主席著作，引导他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。很多革命群众产生了要求实现革命大联合的强烈愿望。
    毛主席关于革命大联合的号令下来了！革命群众纷纷表示：坚决照办，句句照办！
    “红色造反者”负责人之一白喜善，原来认为同“东方红”联合，就是“投降”，对“东方红”，只能搞垮，不能联合。现在，经过学习毛主席的最新指示，脑子里的疙瘩解开了。他说：
    “毛主席他老人家说得对，工人阶级内部就是没有根本的利害冲突。‘红色造反者’同‘东方红’是阶级兄弟，是并肩战斗过的战友，只能联合，不能分裂。”
    有几个一时没有想通的“红色造反者”战士问白喜善：“咱们这样跟‘东方红’联合，符合原则吗？”
    白喜善激动地说：“听毛主席的话，就是最大的原则！”
    维修车间“红卫一组”，是最早从“红色造反者”中分出来的。学习了毛主席的最新指示，决心为全厂实现革命大联合贡献力量。可是又怕人家讥笑：要分的是你们，要合的又是你们。经过一番讨论，他们认为怕讥笑是私心，听毛主席的话最要紧。坚决地执行毛主席的命令，是无产阶级革命派必须具备的基本品质。他们毅然决然地贴出了第一张倡议全厂实现革命大联合的大字报。
    支持和响应的大字报，很快贴满全厂。
    毛主席的最新指示把广大革命群众动员起来了。九月十九日，支左人员召集两派组织负责人开会，再一次学习毛主席的最新指示。
    会后，“东方红”决定：响应毛主席的伟大号召，立即写实现革命大联合的倡议。
    “红色造反者”决定：遵照毛主席“只争朝夕”的教导，立即行动。
    这一天晚上，灯火通明。“红色造反者”负责人率领战士，抬着毛主席像，举着红旗，敲锣打鼓地向支左部队，向“东方红”总部送来了决心实现革命大联合的大字报。“东方红”负责人快步迎上来。工人兄弟的手紧紧地握在一起了！
    全厂革命大联合实现了，无产阶级革命派大联合委员会成立了。
    北京针织总厂的广大革命职工，又唱出了一曲紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的凯歌！
    毛主席的话，代表了工人阶级的根本利益。北京针织总厂的革命职工，对伟大领袖毛主席的话，理解的执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行，在执行过程中加深理解。他们说：“执行不执行毛主席的指示，不是什么水平问题，而是忠不忠于毛主席的问题。”
    在全厂紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，实现革命大联合的日子里，青年女工郝桂荣，对一些具体问题并没有想通。但是，她怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，坚定不移地听毛主席的话，坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，积极为全厂实现革命大联合贡献自己的力量。在全厂实现革命大联合的那一天，她战斗在广播站，用响亮而热情的声音，广播各单位的报喜信。在实现革命大联合以后，她不说不利于大联合的话，不做不利于大联合的事。
    实现革命大联合以后，郝桂荣亲眼看到，全厂到处称颂革命大联合的好处，到处痛斥资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的罪状。斗私批修搞得热火朝天，人的精神面貌焕然一新。工人干劲十足，生产捷报频传。郝桂荣对毛主席的最新指示越来越理解了。她兴奋地说：“毛主席的话句句是真理。现在我完全想通了，革命大联合就是好！”	        灵魂深处爆发革命
    正当全国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时候，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席又发出了新的战斗号令：“要斗私，批修”。
    这是保证我国无产阶级文化大革命取得全面彻底胜利的根本方针。北京针织总厂革命职工，热烈拥护这一伟大指示，坚决执行这一伟大指示。
    一位漂染工说：“一滴墨汁，能把一锅清水染污；一分私心，会把一个人的灵魂腐蚀。”
    一位检验工说：“‘私’字好比成品上的疵点，不管它大小，一见它，就要把它抓住，不能放过它去！”
    一位清洁工说：“‘私’字好比地上的垃圾，机器上的油泥，一定要把它彻底清除。”
    一场斗私批修的“人民战争”，在北京针织总厂展开了！
    一个个以“斗私，批修”为纲的毛泽东思想学习班，在厂里，在集体宿舍，在家属住区，相继开办。
    一个个以“斗私，批修”为中心的学习毛主席著作讲用会，在全厂，在车间，在职工家庭里，纷纷举行。
    斗私批修的革命洪流，激荡着每个角落，触动着每个人的灵魂。
    青年工人刘文闯，是从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下杀出来的小将。刚到毛泽东思想学习班时，认为主要是来帮助别人的，自己没有什么“私”字要斗。
    真的没有“私”字吗？在解放军支左人员帮助下，他学习了毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”，严格地检查自己，有许多地方不符合毛主席的教导。他越想越感到自己头脑里不是没有“私”字，而是“私”字很多，和张思德、白求恩那种毫无自私自利之心的光辉形象相比，相差太远了。
    面对着自己的“私”字，怎么办？是包起来，消极防御，还是亮出来，积极进攻？刘文闯思想上发生了激烈的斗争。他顾虑亮了私被人瞧不起，自己是车间勤务组副组长不好向群众做工作；他又怕被原来另一派的同志抓住“辫子”，想先看看别人是什么态度。
    刘文闯，这个工人的后代，原名叫刘连生。他改成现在这个名字，就是为了表达自己永做文化大革命闯将的决心。如今要革自己的命了，能不能也是闯将呢？
    刘文闯反复学习毛主席关于“要斗私，批修”的伟大教导和林彪副主席的指示：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，给刘文闯指明了思想革命化的大道。他越来越深刻地认识到，“私”字，是资产阶级世界观的核心，是产生修正主义的根子。必须狠斗“私”字，才能永远忠于毛主席，当好人民的勤务员。
    刘文闯决心打一场斗私的进攻战，在灵魂深处爆发革命。他第一个向毛泽东思想学习班的全体同志彻底亮私，狠狠斗私。人们说：“闯将又第一个向‘私’字开炮了！”
    刘文闯回到车间，又在群众面前亮私斗私。他深有体会地说：背着“私”字包袱，人就走不动，就不可能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。敢不敢斗私，是忠不忠于毛主席的一个标志，是真革命还是假革命的一个标志。
    斗私批修的滚滚洪流，把贫农出身的原副厂长张成明的思想，也冲刷一新。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始后，张成明执行了资产阶级反动路线，受到群众冲击。他思想不通，心里不服，行动上也顶牛，甚至觉得当干部“吃亏倒霉”，发誓一辈子再也不当干部了。
    在第一期毛泽东思想学习班上，张成明反复学习了毛主席的光辉著作《湖南农民运动考察报告》，逐渐认识到自己犯了错误。但是，又不愿意把“私”字彻底亮出来，怕讲重了，上纲太高，怕讲轻了，群众通不过。
    张成明心潮翻腾，一连几个夜晚都睡不好觉。他捧起革命宝书“老三篇”，白天学，晚上读，有时躺在床上，脑海里还过着英雄形象的“电影”：张思德为人民利益，以身殉职；白求恩为支援中国革命，毫不利己，专门利人。而自己呢，在运动中受了点冲击，就躺倒不干了，这是什么思想？这是个人主义思想。越想越觉得对不起毛主席，对不起党。他反复学习毛主席的教导：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道还有什么不适合人民需要的思想、观点、意见、办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？”伟大领袖毛主席的亲切教诲，深深触动了张成明的灵魂：自己明明有错误，为什么还舍不得彻底丢掉呢？张成明决心在斗私战场上打歼灭战。他在全厂职工大会上对自己的私心杂念和错误行动，作了深刻的检查。
    为了彻底围歼“私”字，他又遵照毛主席的教导，到群众中去，从一个车间到另一个车间，走遍全厂，听取群众批评，争取群众帮助。谁对自己意见多就找谁，谁冲击自己厉害就找谁。
    曾经严厉批评过张成明的老工人王殿宗，看到张成明的转变，十分高兴，语重心长地对他说：“我们过去恨的是你的错误，我们是恨铁不成钢。今后你要和广大革命群众一起，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命啊！”
    火热的阶级感情，温暖着张成明，激励着张成明。他含着激动的泪花说：“是毛主席挽救了我，是阶级兄弟挽救了我！毛泽东思想这把金钥匙，可把我这老锈锁给开开了。”
    北京针织总厂革命委员会成立的时候，张成明当选为革命委员会副主任。现在，他正和广大革命群众一起积极搞斗批改，为把全厂建成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校贡献自己的力量。
      	  毛泽东思想的新天地
    文化大革命的浪涛，荡涤着北京针织总厂的污泥浊水！
    毛泽东思想的光芒，照亮了北京针织总厂的光辉前程！
    随着滚滚向前的大好革命形势，一个热气腾腾的生产新高潮，在北京针织总厂出现了！
    无源流不出水，无棉纺不出纱。北京针织总厂生产的新高涨，来源于威力无穷的毛泽东思想。
    一台台的机器旁，挂着的那小小的交班本，是全厂翻天覆地的变化的一个历史见证。
    工厂党内一小撮走资派，鼓吹什么“用经济办法管理经济”。他们当权的时候，小小的交班本上写的第一是生产，第二是生产，第三还是生产。就在这“一切为了生产”的背后，散发着修正主义的毒素，交班本成为党内一小撮走资派推行“物质刺激”、“奖金挂帅”的工具。
    而今，无产阶级革命派掌了权。天，是毛泽东思想的天；地，是毛泽东思想的地。这小小的交班本也成了学习、宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。
    走进经编车间，随便翻开几段交接班记录，一股股暖流迎面扑来。
    “今天车子非常好开，没有什么毛病，压头不多，边纱也不爱坏。总之，一切顺利。祝你顺利！最后，让我们共同学习最高指示：‘我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务，……’。”
    “最高指示：‘人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。’今天接过车，本来很好开，由于自己没按毛主席教导去做，有‘轻敌’的思想，结果被‘敌人’钻了空子，跑了两个压头，造成了两个疵点。希望你班吸取我班的教训，防止上‘敌人’的当！”
    “今天机器运转正常，但是，在处理压头时，整经造成了许多压纱。当时我想不处理，等到你班再说。后来，想起了毛主席的教导：‘我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。’用‘完全’、‘彻底’两把尺子衡量，觉得自己做得很不够。我应该象张思德同志那样‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务。于是，我下定决心，把所有压纱都处理好了。最后，让我们共同学习最高指示：‘世界上怕就怕“认真”二字，共产党就最讲“认真”。’”
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，统帅了生产，发挥出巨大的力量。
    针织车间台车组联合开车的实现，就是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    十月中旬的一天，针织车间台车丙班下班时，已经是深夜十点半了。他们自动聚拢在一起，又一次认真学习毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示。
    大家脑子里同时出现一个问题：现在组里任务重，人手少，各管各，效率低，车间里还有一些台车闲着。库里有的是纱，却织不出更多的布来，怎么办？
    “咱们联合开车吧！”
    不知谁说了一句，讲到了大伙的心坎上。“联合开车好！”好几个人欢呼起来。也有人有点犹豫：“过去也搞过联合开车，不是没几天就吹了吗？”
    是的，在文化大革命以前，台车组曾经做过联合开车的试验。工人们在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的照耀下，主动提出把个人包干开几台车改为小组集体联合开车，并且大胆进行了试验。可是，因为联合开车和党内一小撮走资派推行的“个人突出”、“指标卡人”、“奖金挂帅”的修正主义路线是根本对立的，他们对这个试验，开始是毫无兴趣，以后就进行破坏。就这样，一棵新生的幼苗，活活被反革命修正主义路线扼杀了！
    想到过去，更激发了大伙对反革命修正主义路线的仇恨，更坚定了大家破旧立新的决心。他们决心破除那一套修正主义的条条框框，创造出闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新天地。他们说：“我们贯彻毛主席发出的‘要斗私，批修’的号召，实现联合开车的思想基础完全具备了！”
    针织车间台车丙班联合开车实现了！
    解放军支左人员敲锣打鼓来到台车丙班，祝贺毛泽东思想的胜利。他们又到其他班传播丙班实现联合开车的喜讯。联合开车在其他班也很快推广了。台车组里呈现出一派团结互助、争挑重担的新气象，原来闲着的台车都开了起来，大大提高了产量。工人们说：“实现了联合开车，我们更加团结了，集体主义思想更增强了。大家想的是为社会主义开车，为世界革命开车。”
    联合开车——这朵灿烂的红花，在毛泽东思想抚育下，茁壮成长！
    一个斗批改的高潮，正在北京针织总厂掀起；一件又一件新事物，不断地从各个车间涌现。
    我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。
    我们的目的一定要达到。
    我们的目的一定能够达到。
    北京针织总厂的无产阶级革命派，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着伟大领袖毛主席开辟的革命航道，以大无畏的革命精神，谱写历史的新篇章！
