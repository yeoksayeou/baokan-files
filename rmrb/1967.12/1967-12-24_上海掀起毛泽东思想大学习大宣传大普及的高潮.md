The ship sails on the sea relying on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, have, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have earnestly studied and deeply understood Chairman Mao's brilliant works and each wise directive, linked them to reality, and strictly followed them. They have launched an unprecedented high tide of studying, promoting, and popularizing Mao Zedong Thought on a grand scale.

In 1967, Shanghai's proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, closely followed the great leader Chairman Mao, closely followed the great Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to make a big stir in the revolution. It was a year in which the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, achieved decisive victories.

Looking at Shanghai today, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has never been so deeply rooted in people's hearts and so thoroughly grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. The broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses are eager to study Chairman Mao's works, consciously placing the study of Chairman Mao's works above everything, greater than everything, before everything, and more important than everything. They do not speak without quoting Chairman Mao's teachings and do not act without following Chairman Mao's directives. Studying, lecturing, reciting, and applying Chairman Mao's works have become a widespread trend.

Since this year, every decision made by the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee has emphasized the need to actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works. Many units have taken organizing the revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's works as their most important task. The leaders of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, which has more than a million members, with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works for half a day each day. They have established the practice of reporting their thoughts and battles to Chairman Mao every day, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to build the working-class ranks, and greatly raising the revolutionary consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses. The broad proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses have decided to take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao for life, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's directives, and being good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before. The important sign of the excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized." In Shanghai, whether in factories, rural areas, the military, government agencies, schools, shops, or alleys, Chairman Mao's works have become the essential reading for the broad revolutionary masses every day. They say, "We do not believe in heaven, we do not believe in earth, revolutionary people only believe in Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao's books are treasures, revolutionary people love to read them." Whether old or young, men or women, everyone is receiving the popularization of Mao Zedong Thought. Various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are spread throughout Shanghai, and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams with a fighting style are active on all fronts. The proletarian revolutionaries and broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai use the boundless Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, guide everything, and implement Chairman Mao's every directive concretely in actual actions. They use the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forward to victory.

The great People's Liberation Army of China, personally founded by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, has, in the year 1967 of studying, promoting, and popularizing Mao Zedong Thought, always fought alongside the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai. The broad cadres and soldiers have formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep into factories, rural areas, schools, and government agencies to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, implement Mao Zedong Thought, and propagate the good experiences of actively learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have set a shining example for the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses.

The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai, reviewing the glorious course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, love Chairman Mao even more and love Mao Zedong Thought even more. They deeply feel that closely following the great leader Chairman Mao, closely following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory. They say that closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment means that for every great directive of Chairman Mao and every battle order issued by the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, one must act immediately, implement it thoroughly and resolutely, and follow it wholeheartedly. The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and many revolutionary mass organizations always strive to convey Chairman Mao's latest directives without delay, following them quickly, closely, and resolutely.

Chairman Mao teaches us that it is reasonable to rebel against the reactionaries. The proletarian revolutionaries and broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have decided not to fear sacrifice and to rebel against the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. They have rebelled against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, such as Chen Pi-xian and Cao Qi-qiu, and other capitalist roaders within the party. In the great storm of the "January Revolution," they resolutely repelled the counter-revolutionary economic wind and seized the power of party, government, finance, and culture from this small group of capitalist roaders. Then, they further pressed their advantage, concentrated their firepower, and concentrated their targets to carry out a thorough criticism, launching a fierce general attack on China's Khrushchev.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. This issue must be resolved." "Not only should one look at the actions and words of cadres, but also at their entire history and work." "Cadres should be educated, and the scope of education should be expanded." The proletarian revolutionaries and broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have severely criticized the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large number and protecting a small number" in the cadre issue. They have strictly distinguished between the two types of contradictions, daringly liberated revolutionary cadres, used revolutionary cadres, and more and more factories, schools, government agencies, and shops have established revolutionary three-in-one combination leadership teams.

Chairman Mao says: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives, broken down petty-bourgeois factionalism, and established proletarian party spirit. On the eve of the 18th anniversary of the founding of New China, they launched a high tide of achieving revolutionary great unity by system and industry. In just a few days, the vast majority of factories, schools, and commercial enterprises achieved revolutionary great unity.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, one must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end." Chairman Mao's latest directive is not only a mobilization order for the masses to carry out the educational revolution but also a new mobilization order for all fronts and units to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai acted immediately, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison of China's Khrushchev and his agents in each unit. They reformed all old thoughts, old institutions, and other superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base, determined to plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in each unit, and build an iron Great Wall to prevent revisionism.

Chairman Mao says: "One must fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism." The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai have studied and implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives, established special Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and targeted their own "selfishness" exposed in the revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. They have used Chairman Mao's latest directives to examine themselves, expose their selfishness, find the root of their selfishness, discuss the harm of selfishness, and use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism. They have continuously raised the level of revolutionary criticism and promoted the revolutionization of thought and work.

Studying with problems in mind, actively learning from and applying, combining study with use, learning urgently needed knowledge, and seeing immediate results by focusing on the "use" are the most prominent features of Shanghai's proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works this year. They say that true proletarian revolutionaries must act according to Chairman Mao's directives, link them to reality, learn a little and use a little, learn and then use, and act decisively. They emphasize that actively learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "use," is to implement every battle order issued by Chairman Mao politically, ideologically, and organizationally; it is to focus on following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The focus of this movement is to rectify those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road." The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai have always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, always aimed their cannons at China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, such as Chen Pi-xian and Cao Qi-qiu, and other counter-revolutionary revisionists. They have steadfastly advanced along the revolutionary struggle direction indicated by Chairman Mao and achieved one victory after another.

Under the correct leadership of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses on all fronts in Shanghai study Chairman Mao's works every day and criticize revisionism. They use red arrows to shoot at black targets and use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize China's Khrushchev's various fallacies. The city has held dozens of televised struggle meetings against Chen Pi-xian and his ilk. The proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres on the industrial, transportation, agricultural, commercial, educational, and united front fronts have exposed and criticized the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes committed by China's Khrushchev through his henchmen Chen Pi-xian and his ilk in their systems and units. They have further criticized China's Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

Currently, a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's party-building theories and criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line has been launched throughout the city. The broad revolutionary party members and non-party proletarian revolutionaries, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, severely criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line. From the fundamental issue of party building, they raise the level of Mao Zedong Thought among the broad revolutionary masses.

The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shanghai, in the process of actively learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works and fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, have further correctly recognized the unprecedented excellent revolutionary situation. They have fought against selfish thoughts and anarchism, exploded a revolution in their souls, broken down selfishness and established public spirit, and consolidated and developed the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. They say, "In a word: forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is the greatest 'public spirit.' Breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, fundamentally, is to thoroughly criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist goods and to establish Mao Zedong Thought. 'Fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism' has powerfully promoted the revolutionization of thought among Shanghai's proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses. A proletarian revolutionary force armed with Mao Zedong Thought, full of vigor, revolutionary, and fighting spirit, is rapidly growing and strengthening."

    大海航行靠舵手　干革命靠毛泽东思想
    上海掀起毛泽东思想大学习大宣传大普及的高潮
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众自觉地把毛主席著作的学习放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，对毛主席的各项指示跟得快，跟得紧，跟得坚决
    新华社上海二十三日电　“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众，怀着对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真学习、深刻领会毛主席的光辉著作和每个英明指示，联系实际，句句照办，字字照办，掀起了空前规模的毛泽东思想的大学习、大宣传、大普及的高潮。
    一九六七年，是上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟伟大的毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署大闹革命的一年；是在毛泽东思想的光辉指引下，无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的一年。
    纵观今日的上海，战无不胜的毛泽东思想从来没有象现在这样深入人心，从来没有象现在这样为广大的革命群众所掌握。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，自觉地把毛主席著作的学习放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，口不离毛主席教导，行不离毛主席指示，大学、大讲、大背、大用毛主席著作蔚然成风。
    今年以来，上海市革命委员会作出的每项决定，都强调首先要活学活用毛主席著作。许多单位把组织革命群众学习毛主席著作当作最最主要的任务来抓。拥有一百多万队员的上海工人革命造反总司令部的领导成员，带着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，坚持每日半天学习毛主席著作，建立了天天向毛主席汇报思想和汇报战斗的制度，坚持用伟大的毛泽东思想来建设工人阶级队伍，大大提高了广大革命群众的思想觉悟。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众决心以林彪同志为光辉榜样，一辈子“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”
    毛主席教导我们：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。”在上海，不论是工厂、农村、部队、机关、学校、商店，还是街道里弄，毛主席著作已经成为广大革命群众天天必读的宝书。他们说，不信天，不信地，革命人民只信毛主席；毛主席的书，是宝书，革命人民最爱读。不论男女老幼，都在接受毛泽东思想的普及教育。各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班遍及全上海，具有战斗风格的毛泽东思想宣传队活跃在各条战线上。上海的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众用光焰无际的毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，把毛主席的每个指示扎扎实实地贯彻到实际行动中去，用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想推动无产阶级文化大革命胜利地向前发展。
    毛主席亲自缔造、林副统帅直接指挥的伟大的中国人民解放军驻沪部队，在毛泽东思想大学习、大宣传、大普及的一九六七年中，始终和上海无产阶级革命派、革命群众战斗在一起。广大指战员组成毛泽东思想宣传组，深入工厂、农村、学校、机关，宣传毛泽东思想，贯彻执行毛泽东思想，宣传活学活用毛主席著作的好经验，为无产阶级革命派和革命群众树立了光辉的榜样。
    上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众回顾一年来无产阶级文化大革命的光辉历程，更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛泽东思想。他们深刻体会到，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利。他们说，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就是对毛主席的每一个伟大指示，对以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部发出的每一个战斗号令，必须闻风而动，不折不扣地、坚决彻底地、全心全意地句句照办，字字照办。上海市革命委员会和许多革命群众组织对毛主席的最新指示，总是力争传达不过夜，跟得快，跟得紧，跟得坚决。
    毛主席教导我们，对反动派造反有理。上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众遵照毛主席的教导，下定决心，不怕牺牲，从资产阶级反动路线白色恐怖下“杀”出来，大造中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋等党内一小撮走资派的反。在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，他们坚决击退了反革命经济主义妖风，从这一小撮走资派手中夺回了党、政、财、文大权；接着，又进一步乘胜追击，集中火力，集中目标，开展革命的大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫发起猛烈的总攻击。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”，“干部问题，要从教育着手，扩大教育面。”上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众遵照毛主席的教导，狠狠地批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，大胆解放革命干部，使用革命干部，越来越多的工厂、学校、机关、商店成立了革命的三结合的领导班子。
    毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，大破小资产阶级派性，大立无产阶级党性，在新中国成立十八周年前夕，掀起了按系统、按行业实现革命大联合的高潮。短短几天之内，绝大部分工厂、学校、商业企业实现了革命的大联合。
    毛主席教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”毛主席的这一最新指示，不仅是发动群众进行教育革命的动员令，也是各条战线、各个单位进行斗批改的新的动员令。上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众闻风而动，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在各单位的反革命修正主义流毒，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的旧思想、旧制度等上层建筑，决心在各单位插遍毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，筑起反修防修的钢铁长城。
    毛主席说：要斗私，批修。上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众学习和落实毛主席的最新指示，大办特办毛泽东思想学习班，针对自己在革命大批判、革命大联合、革命三结合和本单位斗批改中暴露出来的“私”字，用毛主席的最新指示检查自己，亮“私”字表现，挖“私”字根源，议“私”字危害，用毛泽东思想斗私，用毛泽东思想批修，不断提高革命大批判的水平，促进了思想革命化和工作革命化。
    带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫，这是上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众今年大学大用毛主席著作的最显著的特点。他们说，真正的无产阶级革命派必须遵照毛主席的指示办事，联系实际，学一点用一点，学了就用，雷厉风行地见之于行动。他们强调指出，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，就是把毛主席发出的每一个战斗号令，从政治上、思想上、组织上认真的落实；也就是在紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署上狠下功夫。毛主席教导我们：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众牢记毛主席的教导，自始至终把炮口对准中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的革命斗争大方向前进，取得了一个又一个胜利。
    在上海市革命委员会的正确领导下，上海各条战线的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，天天学毛主席著作，人人批判修正主义，革命大批判越来越广泛、深入。他们用红箭射黑靶，用毛泽东思想来批判中国赫鲁晓夫的种种谬论。全市已经举行了几十次斗争陈丕显、曹荻秋之流的电视大会。工业、交通、农业、财贸、文教、统战等各条战线的无产阶级革命派、革命群众、革命干部，揭发批判了中国赫鲁晓夫通过他的爪牙陈丕显、曹荻秋之流在本系统、本单位犯下的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，进一步从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫。
    当前，在全市范围内，掀起了大学毛主席的建党学说，大批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义建党路线的高潮。广大革命的党员和非党的无产阶级革命派怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，从建党这个根本问题上，提高广大革命群众的毛泽东思想水平。
    上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在活学活用毛主席著作、斗私批修的过程中，进一步正确地认清空前大好的革命形势，狠斗私心杂念，狠斗山头主义、无政府主义，在灵魂深处爆发革命，破私立公，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。他们说，千言万语，归结一句话：永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是最大的“公”。破私立公，根本的根本，就是大破中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义黑货，就是大立毛泽东思想。“斗私，批修”，有力地推动了上海无产阶级革命派和革命群众的思想革命化。一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的，朝气蓬勃的，革命化、战斗化的无产阶级革命队伍，正在迅速成长壮大。
