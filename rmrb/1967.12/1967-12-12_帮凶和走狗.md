The Soviet revisionist renegade clique recently announced that it is "restoring diplomatic relations" with the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Mobutu puppet regime in the Congo (Zaire). This is yet another crime committed by the Soviet revisionist clique in betraying the Congolese (Zaire) people and the African people.

Who is Mobutu? Everyone knows! He is the despised lackey of U.S. imperialism, the murderer of the Congolese national hero Lumumba. When Lumumba was killed, the Soviet revisionist clique hypocritically cursed Mobutu as the "vile lackey of colonialism," even going so far as to demand that the "United Nations forces" "immediately arrest" him and "hand him over to the court." However, in no time at all, they began to secretly collude with the very same Mobutu, and eventually openly embraced him. Does this mean that Mobutu is no longer the "vile lackey of colonialism"? Of course not. Precisely because Mobutu is the "vile lackey" of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique, as the vile accomplices of U.S. imperialism, regards him as their good friend.

In fact, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has long been colluding with the Mobutu puppet regime, helping U.S. neocolonialism to sabotage and suppress the Congolese (Zaire) national independence movement.

In 1960, the Soviet revisionist clique openly voted in the United Nations Security Council to support the dispatch of the U.S. imperialist tool, the "United Nations forces," to the Congo (Zaire). As a result, the Congolese national hero Lumumba was killed, and the Congolese (Zaire) national independence movement suffered a severe setback.

In 1961, the Soviet revisionist clique again peddled the counter-revolutionary goods of the "parliamentary road" in the Congo (Zaire), urging Kizannga to abandon armed struggle and participate in the "United Nations forces" "protected" Congolese (Zaire) parliament and puppet government. As a result, Kizannga was imprisoned, many patriots were persecuted, and the Congolese (Zaire) national independence movement suffered another setback.

Throughout this year, U.S. imperialism has played a crude trick in the Congo (Zaire). It has done everything possible to dress up Mobutu, this national traitor, as a "national hero," directing him to infiltrate the ranks of African independent nations, to disintegrate and sabotage the anti-imperialist struggle of the African people, so that U.S. imperialism can use the Congo (Zaire) as a major stronghold to further expand into other regions of Africa. In this situation, Brezhnev, Kosygin and the like immediately joined in, frantically pasting gold on Mobutu's face, shamelessly praising his adoption of "measures to break free from the economic control of foreign monopolies," expressing a desire to "develop friendly and cooperative relations" with him. Following this, they openly announced the "restoration of diplomatic relations" with the Mobutu regime. The Soviet revisionist clique does this, on the one hand, to serve U.S. imperialism, and on the other hand, to use Mobutu as a tool to promote its own neocolonialism in Africa.

The Soviet revisionist clique has always boasted of being the "sincere and selfless friend" of the Asian and African peoples, claiming to have consistently provided "comprehensive assistance" to the national liberation movements. Yet, these masks are repeatedly torn off by their own betrayal. The Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal in the Congo (Zaire) over the past few years is a clear example.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Reactionaries who appear in disguise give people a false impression while concealing their true nature. But since they are reactionaries, they cannot completely conceal their true nature." Isn't this the case with the Soviet revisionist clique of reactionaries?

The Congolese (Zaire) people are continuing their anti-American patriotic struggle with unyielding determination. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are flourishing. The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the people of the world is continuously achieving new victories. U.S. imperialism and all its accomplices and lackeys will ultimately be "handed over to the court" to face the severe judgment of the revolutionary people of the world!

　　帮凶和走狗
    苏修叛徒集团最近宣布同美帝国主义在刚果（金）的走狗蒙博托傀儡集团“恢复外交关系”。这是苏修集团叛卖刚果（金）人民和非洲人民的又一罪行。
    蒙博托是个什么东西，何人不知，何人不晓！他是人们所不齿的美帝国主义的奴才，是杀害刚果民族英雄卢蒙巴的凶手。当卢蒙巴被害的时候，苏修集团也曾假惺惺地大骂蒙博托是殖民主义者“卑鄙的走狗”，甚至煞有介事地要求“联合国军”将他“立即逮捕”，“送交法庭”。然而，曾几何时，他们就和同一个蒙博托从暗中勾搭，进而公开拥抱了。难道蒙博托不再是殖民主义者“卑鄙的走狗”了吗？当然不是。恰恰因为蒙博托是美帝国主义的“卑鄙的走狗”，所以作为美帝国主义卑鄙的帮凶的苏修集团，才把他看作是自己的好朋友。
    其实，苏修叛徒集团早就同蒙博托傀儡集团勾结在一起，帮助美国新殖民主义破坏和镇压刚果（金）的民族独立运动。
    一九六○年，苏修集团公然在联合国安理会投票支持派遣美帝国主义的工具“联合国军”去刚果（金）。结果，刚果的民族英雄卢蒙巴被杀害，刚果（金）民族独立运动遭到了严重的挫折。
    一九六一年，苏修集团又在刚果贩卖“议会道路”的反革命黑货，竭力怂恿基赞加放弃武装斗争，去参加“联合国军”“保护”下的刚果（金）议会和傀儡政府。结果，基赞加被拘禁，许多爱国者受到迫害，刚果（金）民族独立运动再次遭受挫折。
    今年以来，美帝国主义在刚果（金）玩弄了一套拙劣的诡计。它千方百计地把蒙博托这个民族败类打扮成“民族英雄”，指使他钻进非洲民族独立国家的行列，瓦解和破坏非洲人民的反帝斗争，以便于美帝国主义以刚果（金）为主要据点，加紧向非洲其它地区扩张。在这种情况下，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流马上起而配合，拚命往蒙博托集团的鬼脸上贴金，无耻地吹捧它采取了“摆脱外国垄断资本的经济控制的措施”，表示要同它“发展友好和合作关系”。接着就公然宣布同蒙博托集团“恢复外交关系”。苏修集团所以这样做，一方面是为了替美帝国主义效劳，另一方面也是为了利用蒙博托这个工具，在非洲推行自己的新殖民主义。
    苏修集团竭力标榜自己是亚非人民“真诚无私的朋友”，吹嘘一贯给民族解放运动以“全面援助”。可是，这些画皮总是一次又一次地被它自己的叛卖活动所揭穿。几年来苏修集团在刚果（金）的叛卖行径，就是一个最明显的例子。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底”。苏修集团这一伙反革命分子，不也正是这样的吗！
    刚果（金）人民正在前赴后继地坚持反美爱国斗争。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展。全世界人民的反帝革命斗争正在不断取得新的胜利。美帝国主义及其一切帮凶和走狗终究要被“送交法庭”，接受世界革命人民的严厉审判！
