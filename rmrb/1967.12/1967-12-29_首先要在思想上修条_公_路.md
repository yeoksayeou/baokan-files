Because of the issue of whether or not to let his son participate in building the road, a family studied Chairman Mao's works, and after a struggle against selfishness, Grandpa Shi recognized:

First, Build a "Public" Road in Your Mind

Poor peasant community member Shi Baofa's eldest son, militia platoon leader Shi Mingcheng, actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness for war, and wanted to go and participate in building the road. When Grandpa Shi heard this, he had a moment of selfishness and did not want his son to go. The son, hearing this, got angry and argued with his father, then stormed off in a huff. The second daughter-in-law, Wang Suomei, who was present, said, "Father, what you did is wrong. Comrade Norman Bethune was a foreigner, yet he helped the Chinese revolution; for the country, how can we not go to build the road?"

Grandpa Shi felt ashamed and did not say anything more.

The next morning before breakfast, the family studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Suomei asked, "Father, have you struggled against your selfishness over yesterday's matter?" Grandpa Shi said, "I have. Mistakes must be corrected. Building the road is a big deal, and in building the road, there can be no selfishness. I have suffered more than you all, and my feelings for Chairman Mao are deeper, but why am I worse than you all in listening to Chairman Mao's words? I thought about it for a long time, and I realized that I am worse than you all in the matter of 'public spirit.' I just think of myself too much and think of the country too little."

These few short sentences warmed the hearts of the whole family.

After Mingcheng left home in a huff, he kept thinking: Father doesn't want me to come out because of selfishness. I want to build a "public" road, but he wants to go down the "private" road. If I don't struggle against his selfishness and build the "road" at home, I won't be able to follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and walk towards communism. This is a big issue of whether or not to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao! So, he took two days off and decided to go home to "build the road."

The next evening after Mingcheng got home, the family held a meeting to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. Grandpa Shi was the first to speak about his experience in struggling against selfishness. He said, "This time, in building the road, I didn't want Mingcheng to go because of selfishness. My son and daughter-in-law used Chairman Mao's words to guide me. Chairman Mao's words are the ones I love to hear the most. When I hear them, I think: Comrade Norman Bethune was a foreigner, yet he helped the Chinese revolution; for the country, we poor and lower-middle peasants must go; if the landlords go, I wouldn't feel at ease! Listening to Chairman Mao's words is to struggle against selfishness and walk the 'public' road. But I say one thing and do another. Why? I thought about it for a long time, and it's still the 'selfish' character blocking the way. I am the head of the family and also a little student in the small classroom. You all see my selfishness and point it out, and I will struggle against it! In the past, when I worked for the landlord, wasn't it every day going out with the stars and coming back with the moon, working hard all year, suffering a lot, sweating a lot, but in the end, I still had nothing... But that Chinese Khrushchev, he actually said that 'exploitation is a merit.' What merit? The landlords and capitalists have merits, and the poor people only have death! Now it's good, all thanks to Chairman Mao. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words and walk the 'public' road indicated by Chairman Mao."

Grandpa Shi's speech was praised by the whole family.

Billions of people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are building a "public" road straight to communism in their hearts.

    因为要不要让儿子参加修公路的问题，一家人学习了毛主席著作，经过斗私，老大爷认识到：
    首先要在思想上修条“公”路
    沈军宣
    贫农社员石宝发老大爷的三儿子、民兵排长石明成，积极响应毛主席抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备的伟大号召，要去参加修公路。石大爷听说后，私心一闪，不想让儿子去。儿子一听急了，和父亲吵了几句，一气之下，就走了。在场的二儿媳妇王素梅说：“爹，你这样做可就不对了。人家白求恩是外国人，还帮中国革命；咱们为国家修公路，怎能不让去呢？”石大爷自觉理亏，就没有再说什么。
    第二天早饭前，一家人学习了《纪念白求恩》。素梅问：“爹，昨天那事你斗‘私’斗好了没有？”石大爷说：“斗好了。错了就改嘛。修公路是大事，修公路就不能有私心。我受的苦比你们多，对毛主席的感情比你们深，可是在听毛主席的话上，我为什么比你们差呢？想了老半天，我比你们差就差在一个‘公’字上，我就是想自己多了，想国家少了。”短短几句话，说得全家人心里热呼呼的。
    石明成带气离家后，心里一直在想：爹爹不愿让我出来，是“私”字在作怪。我要修“公”路，他却要往“私”路上走。不把他的“私”字斗掉，不在家里把“公路”修好，就不能按毛主席指引的方向，走向共产主义。这可是走不走毛主席指引的路的大问题啊！于是，他请了两天假，决定回家“修公路”。
    明成到家的第二天晚上，开了一个家庭斗私批修会。石大爷第一个讲了斗私的体会。他说：“这次修公路，我不愿让明成去，是‘私’字作怪。儿子、媳妇都用毛主席的话开导我。毛主席他老人家的话我最爱听，听了我就寻思：白求恩是外国人，还帮中国革命；为国家修公路，咱贫农下中农不去谁去？让地主去我还不放心哩！听毛主席他老人家的话，就是要斗私心，走‘公’路。可嘴上说了，遇到实际事又想不通了。为什么不通了呢？想来想去，还是‘私’字挡了道。我是家长，也是小课堂里的小学生，你们见我有私就提，提出来我就斗！我过去给地主干活，哪天不是披着星星去，戴着月亮回，一年苦到头，罪没少受，汗没少流，到头来，还是要啥没啥……。可那个中国赫鲁晓夫，他硬胡说什么‘剥削有功’。有什么功？地主、资本家有了功，穷人就只有死！现在好了，都亏毛主席他老人家。咱们就是要听毛主席他老人家的话，走毛主席指引的‘公’路。”
    石大爷的发言，受到了全家的赞扬。
    亿万人民用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来，就在自己的心坎上修起一条直通共产主义的“公”路。
