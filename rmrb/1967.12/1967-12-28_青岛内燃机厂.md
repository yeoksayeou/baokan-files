The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Qingdao Internal Combustion Engine Factory is resolutely implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They use revolution to lead production and revolution to drive the development of production. The entire factory's production is thriving, and they have completed the annual national production plan ahead of schedule by one month. From January to November, the actual total output value increased by 43.4% compared to the entire previous year, costs were reduced by 12.5%, and quality was steadily improved.

This achievement has further helped them understand that the essence of Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" is "seizing the revolution." Only by placing revolution in the first position, using revolution to lead production, and conducting a good job of revolutionary criticism, struggle, and reform, can one promote the thought revolution of the people and thereby improve production. They specially established a leading group for revolutionary criticism, mobilized the masses extensively, and launched a fierce attack on the revisionist line in enterprise management. A new high tide of revolutionary criticism quickly swept across the entire factory. Through revolutionary criticism, they further enhanced their awareness of revolution and production, which effectively promoted the development of production.

    青岛内燃机厂
    青岛内燃机厂的无产阶级革命派，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以革命统帅生产，以革命推动生产的发展，全厂生产蒸蒸日上，提前一个月全面超额完成了全年的国家生产计划，一至十一月实际完成的总产值比去年全年增长百分之四十三点四，成本比去年降低了百分之十二点五，质量稳定提高。
    这一成绩的取得，使他们进一步认识到毛主席“抓革命，促生产”这一伟大方针的灵魂是“抓革命”。只有把革命放在首位，以革命统帅生产，搞好革命的大批判和斗批改，才能促进人的思想革命化，从而把生产搞好。他们专门成立了大批判领导小组，广泛发动群众，向企业管理上的修正主义路线猛烈开火。在全厂范围内迅速掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。通过革命大批判，他们进一步提高了革命和生产的自觉性，有力地推动了生产的发展。
