Indian revolutionary people are striving to study Chairman Mao's works. People of the world revolution must study Mao Zedong Thought.

The reactionary clique in India and the Soviet revisionists' running dogs, the Dange clique, and the Indian Communist Party revisionists are singing in unison, spreading the fallacies of bourgeois "democracy" and "peaceful transition," attempting to lull the revolutionary spirit of the Indian people. However, the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the revolutionary path of the Indian people. Indian revolutionary masses find the direction of struggle in Chairman Mao's works. An Indian friend, after reading the article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," emphasized Mao Zedong's truth: "In a class society where there is freedom for the exploiting classes to exploit the laboring people, there is no freedom for the laboring people not to be exploited. With bourgeois democracy, there is no proletarian and laboring people's democracy." He also read Chairman Mao's aphorisms on seizing power by armed force. He said excitedly, "We must thank Chairman Mao. He has shown us the way. Bourgeois parliamentary democracy is a thoroughgoing fraud. One cannot overthrow the reactionary rule through parliamentary elections. The only correct path is to organize the masses to wage revolutionary struggle."

An Indian trade union worker, after seeing in Chairman Mao's works the direction of the workers' struggle from within the factory to outside the factory, and from economic struggle to political struggle, felt greatly inspired. He said, "Indian workers need to study Chairman Mao's works. The Indian workers' movement is now mainly economic struggle, and it must also universally develop into political struggle. Only by overthrowing the reactionary rule in India and eliminating the influence of imperialism in India can the lives of the Indian people be truly improved, and economic problems fundamentally solved."

"Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." The Indian people, in the long and complex class struggle, have increasingly deeply felt the great significance of this truth pointed out by Chairman Mao. Many people urgently demand to study Chairman Mao's military works. Some revolutionary masses have mimeographed these works and the article "Long Live the Victory of People's War" by Comrade Lin Biao and distributed them, organizing serious study.

"The Quotations from Chairman Mao" has been warmly welcomed in India. Some Hong Kong compatriots working as seamen recently, when passing through Calcutta, gave "The Quotations from Chairman Mao" to Indian workers repairing ships. These workers excitedly shouted, "Mao Zedong, good! Mao Zedong is great!" They raised the red treasure book high and said, "You must study Mao Zedong Thought, we must study it, and all revolutionary people of the world must study it!"

An Indian trade union worker wrote to a Chinese friend, "The 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is the greatest encouragement to the Indian people who are still suffering under the oppression of capitalists at home and abroad. It is the great guide for our future struggle and victory." Another trade union worker orally translated "The Quotations from Chairman Mao" into Urdu and, section by section, recited it to the workers, organizing the masses to study section by section. He excitedly told the Chinese friend, "Chairman Mao's words are the essence of revolutionary theory, the most profound in meaning, and the most colloquial in language. The worker masses understand them immediately and love to study them."

The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought will surely be grasped by the broad Indian people and become a great material force. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　印度革命人民努力学习毛主席著作
    世界革命人民都要学毛泽东思想
    印度反动派放出的反华妖雾遮不住光辉的太阳，印度革命群众怀着无限崇敬、无限热爱的心情学习毛主席的著作，结合印度的实际情况运用毛泽东思想。
    最近，印度反动派和苏修在印度的走狗丹吉集团以及印共修正主义分子一唱一和，大肆鼓吹资产阶级“民主”和“和平过渡”谬论，妄图麻痹印度人民的革命斗志。但是，毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了印度人民革命的道路，印度革命群众在毛主席著作中找到了斗争的方向。一位印度朋友阅读了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文，他着重地领会毛主席指出的这一真理：“在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”他还读了毛主席关于武装夺取政权的语录。他激动地说：“我们要感谢毛主席，他为我们指明了方向。资产阶级议会民主是彻头彻尾的骗局，决不能靠议会选举去推翻反动统治。唯一正确的道路是组织人民群众去进行革命斗争。”
    印度一位工会工作者看到毛主席著作中指出的工人斗争从厂内向着厂外、从经济斗争向着政治斗争这个发展方向，感到很有启发。他说：“印度工人很需要学习毛主席的著作。印度工人运动现在还是以经济斗争为主，它一定也要普遍地向政治斗争发展。只有推翻印度反动统治，清除帝国主义在印度的势力，印度人民的生活才有可能真正得到改善，经济问题才能根本解决。”
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”印度人民在长期、复杂的阶级斗争中，日益深刻地体会到毛主席指出的这个真理的伟大意义。许多人迫切要求学习毛主席的军事著作。有些革命群众把这些著作和林彪同志写的《人民战争胜利万岁》文章油印出来散发，认真地组织学习。
    《毛主席语录》在印度受到热烈欢迎。一些担任海员工作的香港同胞最近途经加尔各答时，把《毛主席语录》送给修船的印度工人。这些工人兴奋地高呼：“毛泽东，好！毛泽东伟大！”他们把这本红色宝书高高举起，说：“毛泽东思想你们要学，我们也要学，全世界革命人民都要学！”
    一位印度工会工作者写信给中国朋友说：“《毛主席语录》对于还在本国和外国资本家的压迫下深受苦难的印度人民，是最大的鼓舞。它是我们今后斗争和胜利的伟大指针。”另一位工会工作者把《毛主席语录》口头译成乌尔都文，在工人中逐段朗诵，组织群众逐段学习。他兴奋地告诉中国朋友说：“毛主席的话是革命理论的精华，道理最深刻，语言最通俗。工人群众一听就懂，最爱学习。”
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想必将为广大印度人民所掌握，成为巨大的物质力量。　（据新华社）
