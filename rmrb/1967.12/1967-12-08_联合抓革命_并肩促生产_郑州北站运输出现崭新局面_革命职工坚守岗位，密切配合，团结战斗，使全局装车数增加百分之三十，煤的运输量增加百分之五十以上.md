The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and the people at Zhengzhou North Station, one of the largest railway hubs in the country, have united under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." They have united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, seized the revolution, and vigorously promoted production, creating a new situation where transportation production continues to rise.

Originally, the revolutionary masses at Zhengzhou North Station were divided into several factions, which affected their ability to cooperate and complete railway transportation tasks. After uniting, they immediately threw themselves into the intense struggle of seizing the revolution and promoting production. In late November, the workers braved the wind and snow to dismantle and reorganize thousands of freight cars that arrived here daily, ensuring that trains could smoothly travel to various parts of the country. In these days, due to the close cooperation of the workers, the transportation volume has been continuously increasing. On November 28, when the temperature was at its lowest, the number of trains arriving at and departing from the North Station increased by 32% compared to November 25 before the snowfall, and the number of trains reorganized and dismantled increased by 37%. Due to the improved operational efficiency of Zhengzhou North Station, the overall car loading volume of Zhengzhou Railway Bureau increased by 30%, and the coal transportation volume increased by more than 50%.

On the operational site of Zhengzhou North Station, one can now see everywhere the moving examples of revolutionary workers closely cooperating and fighting together. After uniting, the revolutionary workers of the first shift at Zhengzhou North Station maintained basic full attendance day and night, with everyone firmly guarding their posts and bravely taking the lead. On November 30, they created a record of dismantling 33 trains and reorganizing 24 trains in one shift, leading all shifts. Switchman Liu Jinceng of the 52nd switch and locomotive driver Li Chengming of the 4th shunting group originally belonged to two different organizations, but they cooperated closely and completed their production tasks well. The seven members of the 4th crane group originally belonged to three factions, but they united in battle, coordinated their actions, and excellently completed their production tasks.

Now, Zhengzhou North Station has representatives from various relevant parties forming a temporary command center for railway transportation production to strengthen production leadership. Service personnel from various mass organizations and cadres at all levels have also gone to the front lines, together with the broad revolutionary workers, launching a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production in the Zhengzhou railway system.

    联合抓革命  并肩促生产
    郑州北站运输出现崭新局面
    革命职工坚守岗位，密切配合，团结战斗，使全局装车数增加百分之三十，煤的运输量增加百分之五十以上
    据新华社郑州四日电　全国最大的铁路枢纽站之一——郑州北站的广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上联合起来，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使全站出现了运输生产不断上升的新局面。
    郑州北站的革命群众原来分成几派，工作上不能很好配合，影响了铁路运输任务的完成。联合起来以后，他们立即投入了紧张繁忙的抓革命、促生产的斗争。十一月下旬，职工们冒着风雪严寒，把每天来到这里的几千辆货车进行解体、编组，使列车顺利地通往全国各地。这些日子，由于职工们密切配合，运输量不断上升。就在十一月二十八日气温最低的这一天，北站到达和发出的列车数比大雪前的二十五日增加了百分之三十二，编组和解体列车数增加了百分之三十七。由于郑州北站的作业效率提高，使郑州铁路局全局的装车数增加了百分之三十，煤的运输量增加了百分之五十以上。
    在郑州北站的作业现场上，现在到处可以看到革命职工密切配合，团结战斗的动人事例。郑州北站第一班的革命职工联合起来以后，不论白天黑夜，都保持了基本满勤，人人坚守岗位，个个奋勇当先，他们在十一月三十日创造了一班解体列车三十三列、编组列车二十四列的优异成绩，在各班中领了先。这个班的五十二号扳道员刘金城和第四调车组机车司机李成明原来分属于两个组织，但他们密切协作，生产任务完成得很好。第四吊车组七个人原来分三派，他们联合战斗，协调动作，出色地完成了生产任务。
    现在，郑州北站已经由各有关方面派出代表组成铁路运输生产临时指挥部，加强了生产的领导。各群众组织的服务员和各级干部也深入第一线，和广大革命职工一起，掀起了郑州铁路系统抓革命、促生产的新高潮。（附图片）
