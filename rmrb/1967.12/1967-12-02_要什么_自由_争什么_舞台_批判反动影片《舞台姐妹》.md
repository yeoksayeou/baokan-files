The stage of literature and the arts is a microcosm of the political stage.

The reactionary film *Stage Sisters* seems to only depict the joys and sorrows of two Yue opera performers, merely events on the theatrical stage. In reality, it not only speaks on the issue of literature and the arts but, more importantly, it speaks on political issues. *Stage Sisters* performs events on the "small stage" of theater, aiming to contend for the "large stage" of politics.

Jǔ Chūnhuā is the protagonist of the film. The film's directors have bestowed upon her the title of "revolutionary literary and artistic worker," extolling and praising her. Jǔ Chūnhuā's philosophy of life and path in life is supposedly "to live a clean and pure life, to sing opera earnestly and sincerely." The directors emphasize this path she took, portraying her as a heroine who dares to resist and fight back against tyranny while living a clean and pure life and singing opera earnestly and sincerely. The film's other protagonist, Xíng Yuèhóng, falls into decadence precisely because she "forgot her teacher's dying instructions" and did not adhere to this path of "living a clean and pure life and singing opera earnestly and sincerely."

The film not only emphasizes this path that Jǔ Chūnhuā took but also enthusiastically sings the praises of her "victory." Look, Jǔ Chūnhuā refuses to perform *The Widow Ma Opens a Shop*, and Manager Táng has to back down; she rejects becoming the adopted daughter of Madame Shěn, and the other party is helpless against her; she firmly refuses to give up the theater, and Manager Táng finds it troublesome; even the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee's Commissioner Pān is at a loss. The film tells the audience: Jǔ Chūnhuā's path is a viable one. By following this path, one can not only remain unstained by filth but also obtain the crowns of "Yue Opera Queen" and "revolutionary literary and artistic worker."

What kind of commodity is this path that the film's directors have spared no effort to extol?

In an era where national and class contradictions are extremely sharp, opposing class struggle and rejecting revolution means surrendering to imperialism, traitors, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and walking the path of capitulationism advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. Jǔ Chūnhuā walks this path. Jǔ Chūnhuā relies on the traitor, hooligan, and capitalist Manager Táng, arriving in Shanghai under the occupation of Japanese imperialism. She performs plays like *The Marriage of Pan Jinlian* and *Fang Qing Sings a Ballad*, which propagate feudal poison and bourgeois ideology, tales of talented scholars and beautiful women. Those who support her are people like "money lenders" and "the nephew of Shanghai Mayor Chen Gongbo." Her art is used to whitewash the peace in Shanghai under Japanese imperialist occupation, to make money for people like Manager Táng, to entertain the leisure class, and to numb the people's fighting spirit with opium. Jǔ Chūnhuā soon becomes the "Yue Opera Queen" and "famous throughout half the sky," which precisely proves: her art not only does not touch a single hair of the Japanese invaders and traitorous rulers but also perfectly meets their needs, serving their reactionary rule. Therefore, what is called "living a clean and pure life" is actually not clean at all but is the dirtiest thing; what is called "singing opera earnestly and sincerely" is merely serving the reactionary ruling class honestly and sincerely. As Lenin said: "The freedom of bourgeois writers, artists, and actors is nothing but a mask (or a disguise) for their dependence on the moneybag, their dependence on bribery and their dependence on being kept."

The film's directors not only vigorously promote this reactionary path but also beautify this reactionary path as a "revolutionary path," vigorously praising Jǔ Chūnhuā and her ilk's so-called "struggle for power" under the "leadership of the Party." The film deceives people: a group of artists led by Jǔ Chūnhuā, due to being "oppressed by tyranny," have no freedom to "live" and "perform," and cannot live, so they rise up to resist and struggle, not only to seize the stage of literature and the arts but also to seize the "large stage" of this society. However, deception is still deception. During the period when Japanese imperialism, traitors, and the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled China, Jǔ Chūnhuā and her ilk were not victims at all; on the contrary, they were very favored and pleased by the reactionary rulers. Where do they get their "grievances" and "hatred"? Where do they get their spirit of "resisting tyranny"? Why do they need to seize power from the ruling class? Since this is the case, why do the directors work so hard to beautify them, shouting at the top of their lungs about "seizing power," shouting about seizing the "large stage" of this society? Obviously, the directors are using the spirits of Jǔ Chūnhuā and her ilk to bewitch people, inciting all reactionary forces in society to rebel, to overthrow proletarian dictatorship.

To achieve this reactionary political goal, the directors deliberately fabricate the death of the "Yue Opera Queen" Shāng Huāhuā, emphasizing a "grievance," shouting to "avenge the living and seek justice for the dead"; and maliciously proposing the counter-revolutionary slogan of "resisting tyranny," arrogantly shouting to change the "world," overthrow the "boss," seize the stage of literature and the arts and the "large stage" of society. Jǔ Chūnhuā and her ilk's intense hatred of social reality and such a strong desire for revenge are precisely the dark psychology of the overthrown reactionary class and all the ghosts and snakes. The day the people rise up, is the day of their pain. How can they not curse, hate, attack, and oppose the new society? How can they not always dream of changing the sky and achieving restoration? They will inevitably, with tenfold effort, mad passion, and a hundredfold hatred, join the battle to restore their "paradise" that was taken away, to fight for their families. In the period of socialist revolution, the activities of the reactionary class and the ghosts and snakes in society attempting to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and engage in counter-revolutionary riots are not at all unfamiliar. Not at all. When the bourgeois rightists launched a fierce attack on the Party, viciously cursing the socialist system for lacking freedom, the ghosts and snakes in the literary and artistic world came out in droves, cursing "the Party's heaven," threatening our Party, guaranteeing their "rights to live and perform," which is actually demanding that the Party step down and let the bourgeois reactionary forces take over! During our country's three years of temporary economic difficulties, the bourgeois reactionary forces represented by the Chinese Khrushchev were even more aggressive, revealing their counter-revolutionary wolfish ambitions! They barked and howled, shouting that the Party should "step down," saying nonsense like "the old ones can't do it, don't occupy the toilet without shitting, you should step down and give way..." Even blatantly saying: "Do you see if the sky will change, and return to the old society? It's hard to say if the sky will change." The shouts of the bourgeois reactionary forces are exactly the same as the film's thoughts of changing the "world" and overthrowing the "boss": what is called changing the "world" is to overthrow the state power of the proletariat; what is called overthrowing the "boss" is to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China, ultimately aiming at counter-revolutionary seizure of power and restoring the capitalist system. "To sing new tunes and start anew, to live life from the beginning." The film's two lines of lyrics sing out the urgent feelings of the bourgeois reactionary forces represented by the Chinese Khrushchev to "change the sky"!

All counter-revolutionary forces always attempt to obstruct the forward march of the historical wheel! However, the revolutionary juggernaut always rolls forward along the course charted by our great leader Chairman Mao! The restoration ambitions of the reactionary class represented by the Chinese Khrushchev have been exposed by the revolutionary people. We must press on with our victory, thoroughly settle the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and ensure that our country's socialist mountains and rivers remain unchanged for a thousand generations!

    要什么“自由”争什么“舞台”
    ——批判反动影片《舞台姐妹》
    齐学红
    文艺舞台是政治舞台的缩影。
    反动影片《舞台姐妹》，写的似乎只是两个越剧演员的悲欢离合，只是戏剧舞台上的事。实际上，它不仅对文艺问题发言，而且更主要的是对政治问题发言。《舞台姐妹》演的是戏剧“小舞台”上的事，为的是争政治“大舞台”的权。		一
    竺春花是影片的主人公。影片编导者给她戴上了“革命的文艺工作者”的桂冠，大肆美化，大加赞扬。这个竺春花的人生哲学和生活道路，就是所谓“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”。编导者着力渲染了竺春花所走的这条道路，把她描绘成为“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”而不畏强暴、敢于抗争的英雄。而影片的另一主人公邢月红之所以堕落，就是“忘了师父临终的嘱咐”，没有坚持这条“清清白白的做人，认认真真的唱戏”的道路。
    影片不仅着力渲染竺春花所走的这条道路，而且热情歌颂她的“胜利”。请看，竺春花不演《马寡妇开店》，唐经理只好退让；她拒绝当沈家姆妈的干女儿，对方奈何她不得；她坚决不让出戏馆，唐经理也感到棘手；甚至连国民党市党部的潘委员也束手无策。影片告诉观众：竺春花这条道路是走得通的，顺着这条道路走去，不仅可以出污泥而不染，而且可以得到“越剧皇后”和“革命文艺工作者”的桂冠。
    影片编导者竭尽全力歌颂的这条道路到底是什么货色呢？
    在民族矛盾和阶级矛盾十分尖锐的时代，反对阶级斗争，不要革命，就是要屈服于帝国主义、汉奸、国民党反动派等反革命势力，就是要走中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义道路。竺春花走的就是这条道路。竺春花投靠了汉奸、流氓、资本家唐经理，来到了日本帝国主义占领下的上海。她唱的是《盘夫》、《方卿唱道情》等等宣扬封建毒素和资产阶级思想的才子佳人戏。捧她的是“做钱庄生意的”和“上海市长陈公博的外甥”一类的人。她的艺术是为日本帝国主义占领下的上海粉饰太平，为唐经理之流赚钱，供有闲阶级消遣，麻痹人民的斗志的鸦片烟。竺春花到上海不久就被捧为“越剧皇后”，“红遍半爿天”，正好证明：她的艺术不仅不触动日寇、汉奸统治的一根毫毛，而且正好适应了他们的需要，是为他们的反动统治服务的。由此可见，所谓“清清白白的做人”，实际上一点也不清白，而是最肮脏不过的；所谓“认认真真的唱戏”，不过是老老实实地为反动统治阶级服务罢了。正如列宁所说：“资产阶级的作家、艺术家和演员的自由，不过是他们依赖钱袋、依赖收买和依赖豢养的一种假面具（或一种伪装）罢了。”		二
    影片编导者不但竭力宣扬了这条反动道路，而且还把这条反动道路美化为“革命道路”，竭力吹捧竺春花之流在“党的领导下”，向反动统治阶级展开的所谓“夺权”斗争。影片欺骗人们：以竺春花为首的一群艺人，由于“暴政”逼迫，使得她们没有“做人”和“演戏”的自由，根本活不下去，因此她们起来反抗，起来斗争，不但要夺文艺舞台，还要夺“眼前”这个社会的大舞台。然而，欺骗毕竟还是欺骗。在日本帝国主义、汉奸、国民党反动派统治中国期间，竺春花之流根本不是什么受害者，恰恰相反，倒是很博得反动统治者的宠爱和欢心。她们哪里来的“冤”和“恨”？她们哪里来的“反暴政”精神？她们哪里还需要向统治阶级夺权呢？既然如此，编导者为什么要这样煞费苦心地美化她们，声嘶力竭地叫嚷“夺权”，叫嚷起来夺“眼前”这个社会的“大舞台”？显然，编导者是在借竺春花之流的亡灵，去蛊惑人心，煽动社会上一切反动势力起来翻天，颠覆无产阶级专政。
    为了达到这个反动的政治目的，编导者有意制造“越剧皇后”商水花之死，竭力渲染一个“冤”字，叫嚣要“为活着的不再受害，为死了的报仇伸冤”；并且恶毒地提出“反暴政”的反革命口号，狂妄地喊出改变“世道”，打倒“老板”，夺取文艺舞台和社会的“大舞台”。竺春花之流这种对社会现实无比愤恨的情感，如此强烈的复仇心理，正是被推翻的反动阶级和一切牛鬼蛇神的阴暗心理的写照。人民大众翻身之日，就是他们痛苦之时。他们怎么不对新社会咒骂、仇恨、攻击和反对呢？他们又怎么不时刻梦想变天，实现复辟呢？他们必然以“十倍的努力、疯狂的热情、百倍的仇恨投入战斗，为恢复他们被夺去的‘天堂’、为他们的家庭而斗争”。在社会主义革命时期，反动阶级和社会上牛鬼蛇神妄图颠覆无产阶级专政、搞反革命暴动的活动难道还陌生吗？一点也不陌生。当资产阶级右派向党发动猖狂进攻、恶毒咒骂社会主义制度没有自由的时候，文艺界的牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，大骂“党天下”，要挟我们党，保证他们“做人和演戏的权利”，这实际上就是要党下台，让资产阶级反动势力上台！当我国三年暂时经济困难时期，以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动势力，更是气势汹汹，反革命狼子野心毕露！他们狂吠乱叫，叫嚷要党“让位”，胡说什么“老的不行嘛，不要占着茅坑不拉屎，要下台，要让位……”。甚至赤裸裸地说道：“你们看会不会变天，又回到旧社会？变天也很难讲。”资产阶级反动势力的叫嚣，与影片的改变“世道”、打倒“老板”的思想如出一辙：所谓改变“世道”，就是推翻无产阶级的国家政权；所谓打倒“老板”，就是推翻中国共产党的领导，归根到底是反革命夺权，复辟资本主义制度。“要唱新曲重起调，要过生活从头来”。影片的这两句唱词，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动势力妄图“变天”的迫切心情唱出来了！影片的反动性也就彻底地暴露在光天化日之下了！
    一切反革命的势力总是妄图阻挡历史车轮的前进！但是革命的巨轮却始终沿着我们伟大领袖毛主席指引的航道滚滚向前！以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反动阶级的复辟野心，已被革命人民所戳穿。我们一定要乘胜前进，彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命罪行，巩固无产阶级专政，保证我国的社会主义江山，千秋万代，永不变色！
