The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam authorized the publication of a statement exposing the recent deliberate fabrication by U.S. imperialism. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Recently, U.S. propaganda agencies have spread a series of messages claiming that the "National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has expressed a desire to send representatives to the United Nations to discuss the Vietnam issue."

The Liberation Radio is authorized to declare: This is completely fabricated.

The People's Daily of Vietnam published a commentary titled "A Repeated Shameful Trick" on December 12, condemning the U.S. imperialists' attempt to use the United Nations to interfere in Vietnam, aiming to deceive public opinion and cover up their sinister plot to escalate the war of aggression in Vietnam.

The commentary said that using the United Nations to achieve the goal of invading Vietnam is an old trick of U.S. imperialism. It attempts to use the United Nations, which it controls, to interfere in Vietnam to cover up its aggression. For a long time, the United States has repeatedly brought the Vietnam issue to the United Nations and peddled its so-called "peaceful intentions" and "unconditional negotiation proposals" there. The U.S. often adopts these tactics when it intensifies and expands the war or when the opposition movements at home and abroad are on the rise. However, under the resolute opposition of the Vietnamese people and international public opinion, these tactics have suffered heavy defeats.

The commentary said that the Johnson administration's attempt to bring the Vietnam issue to the United Nations Security Council is also due to the above reasons. Everyone can clearly see that the U.S. government is frantically intensifying the war of aggression in both South and North Vietnam. It has decided to send an additional 50,000 U.S. troops and ordered its puppets to send mercenaries to South Vietnam. It is shouting about expanding the war to Laos, Cambodia, and other places. While committing bloody crimes against the Vietnamese people, Johnson continues to spread cunning "peace" rhetoric.

The commentary pointed out that the aggressive and stubborn attitude of the U.S. government has made the people of the world and the American people extremely indignant. American youth and the American people are promoting the movement to stop the war of aggression in Vietnam and to stop forcing American youth to go to Vietnam to be cannon fodder. The heavy defeat of the U.S. in Vietnam has also made the contradictions within the U.S. ruling class more acute.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' repeated demands to bring the Vietnam issue to the United Nations are merely a shameful farce, attempting to deceive public opinion and cover up their plot to intensify the war. The previous deceptions staged by the U.S. have been exposed, so this time, no matter how much they advertise, they cannot escape the shameful failure.

The commentary said that the Vietnamese people have repeatedly pointed out that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue, and all actions by the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnam issue are illegal and valueless. The root cause of the Vietnam War is U.S. imperialism's aggression, so the way to solve the Vietnam issue is for the United States to stop its aggression against Vietnam. The United States must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops from South Vietnam, and allow the Vietnamese people to resolve their internal affairs. The only true representative of the people of South Vietnam is the National Liberation Front. The four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the stance of the National Liberation Front as reflected in its political program fully reflect the basic national rights of the Vietnamese people.

The commentary concluded by saying that U.S. imperialism is suffering a great defeat. None of its war escalations or deceptive tactics can save it from even greater military and political defeats. Our entire military and civilian population are not afraid of hardships and sacrifices and are determined to press forward to achieve a complete victory in our sacred struggle.

　　越南南方解放通讯社受权发表声明
　　揭穿美国在越南问题上造谣欺骗
　　越《人民报》说美帝妄想把越南问题交联合国是它扩大侵略的罪恶阴谋
    新华社河内十一日电  越南南方解放通讯社十二月九日受权发表一项声明，揭露美帝国主义最近蓄意制造的一个谣言。声明全文如下：
    最近，美国的宣传机构散布一系列消息，说“越南南方民族解放阵线表示希望派人前往联合国去阐述越南问题。”
    解放通讯社受权声明：这完全是捏造的。
    新华社河内十二日电越南《人民报》十二日以《反复上演的无耻把戏》为题发表评论，谴责美帝国主义妄图利用联合国干涉越南，以便欺骗舆论，掩盖它扩大侵越战争的罪恶阴谋。
    评论说，利用联合国来实现侵略越南的阴谋，是美帝国主义一种陈旧的手段。它企图使用由它操纵的联合国来干涉越南，以掩盖它的侵略。长期以来，美国曾经多次把越南问题提交联合国，并在那里兜售美国的所谓“和平诚意”和“无条件谈判建议”。美帝的这些做法，往往是在它加强和扩大战争时或者是在国内外反对它的运动高涨的时候采取的。但是在越南人民和各国舆论的坚决反对之下，它的这种手段都遭到了惨重的失败。
    评论说，约翰逊集团这次企图把越南问题提交联合国安全理事会，也是由于上述原因。谁都清楚地看到，美国当局正在疯狂地加强在越南南北两方的侵略战争。它已经决定增派五万美军，同时命令其仆从向越南南方增派雇佣军。它正叫嚷把战争扩大到老挝、柬埔寨和其他地方。约翰逊在对越南人民犯下血腥罪行的时候，还不断地散布狡诈的“和平”论调。
    评论指出，美国当局的好战和顽固的态度，使世界人民和美国人民无比愤慨，美国青年和美国人民正在促进要求停止侵越战争，停止强迫美国青年到越南充当炮灰的斗争运动。美国在越南的惨重失败，也使美国统治集团内部的矛盾更加尖锐化。
    评论指出，美帝国主义一再要求把越南问题提交联合国，这只不过是一出无耻的丑剧，妄图欺骗舆论，掩盖它加强战争的阴谋。美国在以前导演的一些骗局已经被戳穿，那么，这一次，不管它如何大做广告，也无法摆脱可耻的破产。
    评论说，越南人民曾经多次指出：联合国无权过问越南问题，联合国干涉越南问题的一切行动都是非法的、毫无价值的。越南战争的根源是美帝国主义的侵略，因此，解决越南问题的途径是，美国必须停止侵略越南，美国必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，必须把美军和帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，必须让越南人民解决自己的内部事务。越南南方人民的唯一真正代表是民族解放阵线。越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和民族解放阵线体现在自己的政治纲领中的立场，集中地反映了越南人民的基本民族权利。
    评论最后说，美帝国主义正在大败。它的任何一次战争升级和任何一种欺骗手段，都无法挽救它在军事和政治上的更惨重的失败。我们全国军民不怕艰苦牺牲，决心乘胜前进，把我们民族的神圣斗争推向彻底胜利。
