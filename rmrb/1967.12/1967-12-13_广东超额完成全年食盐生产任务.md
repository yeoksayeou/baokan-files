	Guangdong Exceeds Annual Salt Production Target

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 9: The revolutionary workers of all salt fields in Guangdong Province have responded resolutely to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." They have already completed the annual salt production plan two months ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. Compared to the same period last year, salt production has increased by more than thirty percent.

	Since the beginning of this year, revolutionary workers in all salt fields across the province have consistently adhered to the principle of carrying out the revolution during spare time and on the spot, firmly guarding their production posts. They have successfully carried out the revolution while promoting production.

	This year, revolutionary workers in all salt fields across the province have launched an unprecedented wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch extensive exposure and criticism. Through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary criticism, the class consciousness of the revolutionary workers has greatly improved. They have channeled the revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, ensuring the completion of the annual production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.
