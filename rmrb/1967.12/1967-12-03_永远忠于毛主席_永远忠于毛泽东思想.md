The entire nation's military and civilians are determined to engrave Vice Chairman Lin's inscription in their minds and put it into action. Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our revolutionary people and the great banner of our era. We must learn from Vice Chairman Lin's shining example and with the greatest determination and perseverance, truly master the great Mao Zedong Thought.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 2nd, the great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, inscribed the words: "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" for the first National Navy Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works. This has become a powerful driving force for the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the nation to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Revolutionary masses have expressed that they will deeply engrave Vice Chairman Lin's inscription in their minds, firmly keep it in their hearts, and unconditionally implement it in their actions, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights. They say, Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of our revolutionary people, the great banner of our era, and the eternal truth. We must learn from Vice Chairman Lin's shining example, with the greatest determination and perseverance, truly master the great Mao Zedong Thought, achieve new levels of study, and apply it to new heights.

Revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and many other places have pointed out in their studies that Vice Chairman Lin has always been the most loyal, most resolute, and most courageous in defending Chairman Mao's supreme leadership position. He has held the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought the highest, and is the highest example for us to learn from. Many revolutionary workers excitedly said that Vice Chairman Lin has studied Chairman Mao's works the most actively, applied them the best, and followed Chairman Mao the closest. We must, like Vice Chairman Lin, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, especially emphasize the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao, and especially emphasize the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Many Red Guards said, the glorious task bestowed upon us by history is to take over and pass down the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, let it fly high in all of China and the world, forever! We swear to the Red Commander Chairman Mao: We will definitely take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, love Chairman Mao the most, be loyal to Chairman Mao the most, and let Mao Zedong Thought guide everything we do, forging ourselves into steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, following Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

Revolutionary cadres and masses in Shandong, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and other places, after studying Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, have expressed their determination to push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works in these regions to a new stage. The Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guizhou Military Region issued a notice yesterday, calling on all revolutionary masses in the province to, in conjunction with studying Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, further lead the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works, and turn Guizhou Province into a blazing school of Mao Zedong Thought. The Standing Committee of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Preparatory Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee both held meetings to study Vice Chairman Lin's inscription. Some leaders of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Preparatory Committee said, we must resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, treat studying Chairman Mao's works as the first need in life, resolutely and thoroughly act according to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be Chairman Mao's most faithful students.

Revolutionary masses, cadres, and Red Guards in Henan, Hebei, Hubei, Jilin, Anhui, Fujian, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Ningxia, Liaoning, and other places, after studying Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, have even higher revolutionary spirits and greater revolutionary enthusiasm. They expressed that they will hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and repudiate revisionism, further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, carry out thorough criticism and reform within their units, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Many cadres in Zhengzhou, who are currently studying in Mao Zedong Thought classes, have written oaths and made plans, determined to respond to Chairman Mao's call, better criticize and repudiate revisionism, achieve new merits and labor in the Cultural Revolution. Many workers in factories in Changchun expressed that they will definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome petty-bourgeois thinking in our ranks, further carry out ideological revolutionization, promote revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and better shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

Revolutionary masses across the country are determined to continue studying, deeply understanding, resolutely implementing, and repeatedly practicing Vice Chairman Lin's inscription. They expressed that they will definitely place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, and strive to turn our great motherland into a blazing school of Mao Zedong Thought!

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 2nd, the broad masses of soldiers and officers in the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force, with the greatest enthusiasm, are resolutely implementing Vice Chairman Lin's inscription for the first National Navy Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works: "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The broad masses of soldiers and officers unanimously expressed their determination to take Vice Chairman Lin as their example, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a broader and deeper new high tide in the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works, better complete the glorious tasks of defending the motherland, defending the Cultural Revolution, and the "three supports, two militaries," and achieve new merits for the people in the Cultural Revolution.

In the past two days, from the various levels of leadership organs of the People's Liberation Army to the front lines and border outposts, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have continuously held discussions and study sessions, seriously studying, deeply understanding, and repeatedly implementing Vice Chairman Lin's inscription. Many units held oath-taking rallies, and many soldiers and officers wrote letters of determination and guarantees, expressing their resolve to remember Vice Chairman Lin's inscription in their hearts and implement it in their actions. The news reached the anti-revisionist frontline in Heihe, Heilongjiang Province, where the local military party committee immediately held a meeting, repeatedly studied and implemented measures, and notified subordinate units to actively implement them. The news reached the "Red Spearhead Company" of a certain unit on the Fujian front line, where soldiers and officers formulated implementation plans. The news reached the border guards day and night in the Karakoram Mountains, where the border guards, despite the wind and snow, published wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers, expressing their highest enthusiasm to resolutely implement Vice Chairman Lin's inscription.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers pointed out unanimously in their in-depth study of Vice Chairman Lin's inscription: To seriously implement Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, we must take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The soldiers and officers of the unit where the air force hero Du Fengrui was once stationed said, to be a good soldier forever loyal to Chairman Mao, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide every second of our lives, use Mao Zedong Thought to command every nerve, and let every action conform to Chairman Mao's teachings. In the Cultural Revolution, the soldiers and officers of the "three supports, two militaries" stationed in Shanghai, in studying Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, more diligently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. They said, only by taking "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key, carrying out thorough ideological revolutionization, can we truly be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit stationed on Hainan Island determined to place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, truly turning the unit into a blazing school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Many soldiers and officers executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks in factories, rural areas, organs, and schools, summarized their work in the past period in conjunction with their studies, expressing their determination to raise the "three supports, two militaries" work to a new level. The leftist support personnel of the Beijing Garrison, in summarizing their experiences, deeply felt that following Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is victory, and deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line leads to losing direction; leftist support work cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment. The "three supports, two militaries" personnel of the Tianjin Garrison said, Vice Chairman Lin's inscription has set higher requirements for leftist support work. We must definitely take Mao Zedong Thought as the lifeline of the "three supports, two militaries" work, take Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the lifeline of the "three supports, two militaries," take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key, and do the "three supports, two militaries" work better and better. The soldiers of the unit where the "leftist, love the people" model Li Wenzhong was once stationed, in studying Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, combined with their own battle experiences, greatly praised the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They expressed their determination to treat the process of executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks as a good classroom for learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers guarding the coastal and border defense lines day and night have been immersed in a festive atmosphere these days. They wrote Vice Chairman Lin's inscription: "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" on the walls of airports, docks, and border outposts. They expressed their determination to better use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the guns in their hands, heighten their vigilance, strengthen their preparedness, and be ready at any time to annihilate all invading enemies. A certain naval fleet unit, which is currently on patrol at sea, has repeatedly discussed how to implement Vice Chairman Lin's inscription in action, determined to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen coastal defense, defend the motherland, and defend the Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of soldiers and officers stationed on the Yunnan border gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, solemnly vowing to follow Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and better guard the gates of the motherland, annihilating the enemy wherever they attack. The soldiers and officers of the 9th Company of a certain unit on Nanri Island in Fujian, together with local militiamen, studied Vice Chairman Lin's inscription. They said, we will definitely further strengthen military-civilian unity, strengthen military-civilian joint defense, and with the military and civilians together, launch a new high tide in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, turning the island into an iron wall.
