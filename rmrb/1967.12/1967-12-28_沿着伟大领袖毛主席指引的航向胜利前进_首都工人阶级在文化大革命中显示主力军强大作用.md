Under the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the working class of the capital has been tempered and tested in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with their political consciousness reaching unprecedented heights. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they educate themselves and liberate themselves, overcoming the interference of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, achieving one victory after another, and demonstrating the powerful role of the main force in the Cultural Revolution.

The working class of the capital, living by Chairman Mao's side, is the most loyal to Chairman Mao and the most obedient to Chairman Mao's words, truly the leading force of the proletarian cultural revolution in the capital. In the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, they are the most diligent in studying Chairman Mao's great instructions and the most resolute in acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They use the spirit of "publicness" to overcome "privateness," use proletarian party spirit to overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, humbly learn from the People's Liberation Army, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and make the proletarian cultural revolution in the capital's industrial and mining enterprises advance to victory under Chairman Mao's guidance. The working class of the capital, with their noble revolutionary qualities and spirit, has set a good example for revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, making a significant contribution to promoting the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution throughout the city.

The ship sails the sea relying on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. In Beijing's industrial, transportation, basic construction, and financial and trade systems, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has never been as widespread and in-depth as it is now. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the working class of the capital responded immediately, setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the past few months, thousands of part-time and full-time Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been held in various factories and mines, with over 400,000 people participating in the study. Revolutionary workers read Chairman Mao's books every day and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions in everything they do. Asking Chairman Mao for instructions before work and reporting to Chairman Mao after work have become new customs in factories and mines. In many factories and mines, workers and cadres have generally memorized the "Three Articles." Broad masses of revolutionary workers take Li Wenzhong, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, as their example, being as loyal to Chairman Mao as Li Wenzhong, and taking the four famous sayings, "Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao instructs me, I act accordingly; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I march forward," as their guiding principles. The working class has the deepest feelings for Chairman Mao's works and understands them the best. They study Chairman Mao's works with the distinctive feature of closely linking their thoughts and work with practical reality, combining learning with application, and focusing on the "application" aspect. They realize that selfishness is the foundation of the bourgeois worldview and the root of all evil. They dare to expose their selfishness at the core, fight it at the painful points, and establish publicness at the root, sparking a revolution in their souls and greatly promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts.

Broad masses of revolutionary workers fiercely fight against selfishness, sweep away bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is no reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." After this latest instruction from Chairman Mao was published, the working class of the capital immediately responded, taking the lead, and achieving revolutionary unity within a few days, driving the revolutionary unity of all industries and sectors throughout the city. Since mid to late October, the working class of the capital, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, has seen a surge in revolutionary unity within workshops and teams. Currently, according to statistics from over 800 large and medium-sized enterprises in the city, nearly 90% of the units have achieved revolutionary unity within their systems, industries, and teams. Both sides fiercely fight against the selfishness in their minds, level the hills, make more self-criticisms, carry out heart-to-heart talks and "one red pair" activities, and jointly direct their class hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev, greatly enhancing revolutionary unity and consolidating and developing revolutionary unity from the ideological level.

Broad masses of revolutionary workers seriously implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "believe in and rely on the majority of cadres," doing patient ideological work with cadres who have made mistakes, helping them study Chairman Mao's works, touching their souls, correctly treating themselves, correctly treating the masses, bravely standing up for revolution, and returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A large number of revolutionary leading cadres have been liberated in the city's factories and mines. By the end of November, over 200 factories and enterprises had established revolutionary committees, and many more factories and enterprises are preparing to establish revolutionary committees. Many cadres have joined the three-in-one combination leadership teams, fiercely fighting against "selfishness," following Chairman Mao's instruction to "be both an official and a common person," consulting with the masses on matters, closely cooperating with revolutionary new cadres, and determining to be servants of the people for life. A new leadership style and new relations between cadres and the masses have emerged in many factories and enterprises. In the process of revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, the Beijing Knitting General Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's 8341 Leftist Unit, has modelly implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and become a shining example of Beijing's factories and mines closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. Currently, a wave of learning from and catching up with the Knitting General Factory is surging in Beijing, powerfully promoting the cultural revolution in factories and mines.

Revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination have promoted revolutionary criticism. Broad masses of revolutionary workers have taken up the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, concentrating their firepower and targets, fiercely criticizing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Committee's Peng Zhen anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, launching a struggle between the two roads and the two lines on the industrial front, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the revisionist goods promoted by this small group of anti-revolutionary revisionists from a political, ideological, and theoretical level, and completely eliminating their poison. Some units are combining revolutionary criticism with their own struggle, criticism, and reform, reforming unreasonable regulations and systems.

Broad masses of revolutionary workers in the capital have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production," achieving double victories in revolution and production. Experience has proven that enterprises where the fight against selfishness and revisionism is well done have more solid revolutionary unity, faster progress in the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and more enthusiasm for grasping revolution and promoting production. Under the good revolutionary situation, Beijing's industrial production level in November increased by 3.8% compared to October. In the first eleven months of this year, the production of many products such as synthetic ammonia, agricultural pesticides, compressors, machine-made paper, and printed fabrics has exceeded the same period last year. The Beijing Third Rolling Mill, Beijing Wire Factory, Beijing Watch Factory, and other factories have already completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule in late November and early December. In these advanced factories and enterprises, people have already seen the surging waves of leaps and heard the footsteps of leaps.

    沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的航向胜利前进
    首都工人阶级在文化大革命中显示主力军强大作用
    据新华社二十七日讯　在伟大领袖毛主席和党中央亲切关怀下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，首都工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中经受了锻炼和考验，政治觉悟空前提高。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，排除资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的干扰，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，取得了一个又一个的胜利，显示出文化大革命主力军的强大作用。
    生活在毛主席身边的首都工人阶级，最忠于毛主席，最听毛主席的话，不愧为首都无产阶级文化大革命的领导力量。他们在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，最努力地学习毛主席的伟大指示，最坚决地按毛主席的指示办事，用“公”字克服“私”字，用无产阶级党性战胜资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，虚心地向人民解放军学习，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，使首都工矿企业的无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进。首都工人阶级用他们高尚的革命品质和革命气概，为革命学生、革命干部、革命知识分子树立了良好的榜样，为推动全市无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展作出了重大的贡献。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。在北京工业交通、基本建设和财经贸易系统，广大革命职工活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，从来没有象现在这样广泛、深入。伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，首都工人阶级闻风而动，大办毛泽东思想学习班。几个月来各工矿企业已举办了数千个业余和脱产的毛泽东思想学习班，有四十多万人参加了学习。革命职工天天读毛主席的书，事事照毛主席的指示办。上班向毛主席请示，下班向毛主席汇报，已经成为工矿企业的新风尚。在许多工矿企业，工人、干部普遍背熟了“老三篇”。广大革命职工以毛主席的好战士李文忠为榜样，象李文忠那样忠于毛主席，把“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”这四句名言，当作自己的座右铭。工人阶级对毛主席著作感情最深，学得最透。他们学习毛主席著作，最大的特点就是紧密联系自己的思想实际和工作实际，学用结合，在“用”字上狠下功夫，学一点用一点。他们认识到，私字是资产阶级世界观的基础，是万恶之源，亮私勇于亮在要害，斗私敢于斗在痛处，立公决心立在根本，在灵魂深处爆发革命，大大促进了思想革命化。
    广大革命职工狠斗私字，大扫资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，使革命大联合和革命三结合得到了巩固和发展。“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的这一最新指示公布以后，首都工人阶级立即响应，一马当先，几天之内迅速实现了革命大联合，带动了全市各行各业、各条战线的革命大联合。十月中下旬以来，首都工人阶级紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，又出现了普遍按车间、班组实现革命大联合的高潮。目前据全市八百多个大中型企业的统计，有近百分之九十的单位按系统、行业、班组实现了革命大联合。两派各自狠斗自己头脑里的私字，铲平山头，多作自我批评，开展谈心活动和“一对红”活动，共同把阶级仇恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上，大大增进了革命团结，从思想上巩固和发展了革命大联合。
    首都广大革命职工认真执行毛主席的干部政策，遵照毛主席的“相信和依靠干部的大多数”的教导，对犯错误的干部作耐心的思想工作，帮助他们学习毛主席著作，触及灵魂，正确对待自己，正确对待群众，勇敢地起来革命，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。全市工矿企业已有一大批革命领导干部解放出来。截至十一月底，有二百多个工厂企业建立了革命委员会，还有大批工厂企业正在筹备建立革命委员会。许多干部参加了三结合的领导班子，他们狠斗“私”字，遵照毛主席的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的指示，遇事和群众商量，和革命的新干部密切合作，决心当一辈子人民的勤务员。不少工厂企业里已经出现了新的领导作风和新的干群关系。在革命大联合和革命三结合中，北京针织总厂在人民解放军八三四一支左部队的帮助下，模范地执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，成为北京市工矿企业紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的光辉榜样。目前一个学针织总厂、赶针织总厂的热潮正在北京市兴起，有力地推动了工矿企业的文化大革命运动。
    革命的大联合和革命的三结合，促进了革命的大批判。全市广大革命职工奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，更加集中火力，集中目标，猛批中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委彭真反革命修正主义集团的滔天罪行，展开工业战线两条道路、两条路线的斗争，从政治上、思想上、理论上把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子推行的修正主义黑货，批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清其流毒。一些单位正在把革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，改革不合理的规章制度。
    首都广大革命职工坚决响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，夺取了革命和生产的双胜利。经验证明，凡是斗私批修搞得好的企业，革命大联合就比较巩固，革命三结合进展就快，抓革命促生产的劲头也越足。在大好的革命形势下，十一月份北京工业生产水平比十月份增长了百分之三点八。今年头十一个月，合成氨、农药试剂、压缩机、机制纸、印染布等不少产品的产量超过了去年同时期。北京第三轧钢厂、北京钢丝厂、北京钟表厂等一批工厂，已经分别在十一月下旬和十二月上旬提前完成今年的国家计划。在这些先进的工厂企业里，人们已经看到了跃进的浪头，听到了跃进的脚步声。
