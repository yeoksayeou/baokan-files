Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu, Head of the Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF) to China, said at a reception celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the NLF that the great support of Chairman Mao gives us immense inspiration.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Yang Chengwu, Wu Faxian, Wang Dongxing, Guo Moruo, Liu Ningyi, and other comrades attended the reception to express their warm congratulations.

Comrade Chen Yi, Vice Premier, said in his speech that the U.S. imperialists' attempt to expand the war to save their failing situation is a futile endeavor. The U.S. imperialists and their accomplices' new "peace talks" trick is doomed to fail.

A Xinhua News Agency report dated December 20th stated that Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu, Head of the Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, held a grand reception tonight to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and to celebrate the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against the U.S. imperialists.

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Yang Chengwu, Wu Faxian, Wang Dongxing, Guo Moruo, Liu Ningyi, and other leading comrades were invited to attend the reception.

Comrade Nguyen Thuan Long, Head of the Vietnamese People's Delegation to South Vietnam, Vietnamese Ambassador to China Vu Minh Quan, and other Vietnamese friends in Beijing attended the reception.

The reception began with the military band playing the national anthem of the People's Republic of China and the song "Liberate the South" of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the reception. Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu said in his speech that amidst the joyous atmosphere of celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, all the military and people on all battlefields in South Vietnam were deeply moved and honored to hear the inspiring news: Chairman Mao Zedong sent a congratulatory message to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho. The people of South Vietnam regard the strong support of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people and the great comrade-in-arms of the Vietnamese people, as a great source of inspiration. All the soldiers and people of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, with deep gratitude to Chairman Mao, will march forward with renewed strength, given by Chairman Mao's congratulatory message, and fight even harder and more accurately against the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, to fulfill their historical mission and not disappoint the trust of Chairman Mao.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu reported on the new victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in their war of resistance against the U.S. imperialists, the great significance of the political program adopted by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and the increasing international prestige of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. He said that the victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam over the past seven years are the victories of the correct political and military lines of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the victories of the people's war highly developed in South Vietnam, and the victories of the will to fight to the end of all the Vietnamese people from north to south.

He condemned the U.S. imperialists, who have suffered heavy defeats and have become even more frantic, for their efforts to escalate the war of aggression against South Vietnam, to "upgrade" the war of destruction against North Vietnam to the highest level, to continuously launch military attacks against Cambodian territory, and to constantly launch campaigns of slander and threats against Cambodia. He also condemned their efforts to intensify the war in Laos and create a highly tense situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

He said that in order to cover up their conspiracy to intensify and expand the war, the U.S. imperialists have repeatedly proposed "peace talks" and conspired to use the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnamese question. He said that the U.S. imperialists cannot deceive anyone. The United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnamese question. The military and people of South Vietnam are determined to hold their guns tightly and fight to the end, to achieve the goals clearly stated in the political program of the National Liberation Front, and to fulfill their sacred mission to liberate the South, defend the North, and achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu said that the Chinese people have made every effort to support the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation and to implement Chairman Mao's instructions: "The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam." The military and people of South Vietnam highly appreciate the wholehearted support of the brotherly Chinese people and regard it as a great inspiration and important contribution to the Vietnamese people in their sacred struggle for national liberation. On this occasion, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese government on behalf of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and all the military and people of South Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam are determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people, fight together, and win together forever.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu said that the situation in South Vietnam shows a very bright future for the struggle of the people of South Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam are confident that, under the guidance of the political program of the National Liberation Front, with the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the only true representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam, and with the unity and determination of the people, together with their northern compatriots, and with the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and the people of the world, the people of South Vietnam will surely win. The political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam will surely be realized.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said in his speech that on behalf of the Chinese government and people, he extends his warmest congratulations to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the heroic people of South Vietnam. He said that the political program recently issued by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has further mobilized and united the people of South Vietnam and expressed the determination of the people of South Vietnam to fight the U.S. imperialists to the end. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the only true representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam and the bravest, most determined, and most loyal banner of the people of South Vietnam.

Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the military and people of North and South Vietnam for their united front against the enemy and mutual support, which have dealt a fatal blow to the U.S. imperialists. He said that our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "War educates the people, the people will win the war, win peace, and win progress." The people of North and South Vietnam have been tempered in the struggle, becoming stronger and stronger, and they are united and fighting together, forming an iron wall that cannot be broken.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. imperialists provides a very important experience for the revolutionary people of the world, showing that the U.S. imperialists have no way to deal with the people's war. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his congratulatory message to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho: "Your victory once again shows that, regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated. The Vietnamese people, under the wise leadership of Comrade Ho Chi Minh, are waging a war of resistance against the U.S. imperialists, setting a brilliant example for the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world to liberate themselves."

He said that the U.S. imperialists are not only continuing to increase troops in South Vietnam and intensify the bombing of North Vietnam, but they are also threatening to expand the war to Cambodia and Laos. They are also mobilizing their followers, including the Japanese militarists, to follow them. Under their orders, the recent Sato reactionary government has even publicly issued hysterical anti-China war threats. The U.S. imperialists' attempt to save their failing situation by expanding the war is a futile endeavor. If the U.S. imperialists insist on going their own way, the Chinese people will definitely stand with the Vietnamese people, the Cambodian people, the Laotian people, and the people of Asian countries to give the U.S. aggressors a heavy blow and burn the U.S. imperialist paper tiger to ashes in the flames of the people's war.

He said that the more difficult the situation of the U.S. imperialists in Vietnam, the more they will intensify their military adventures and push for peace talks at the same time. In this conspiracy, modern revisionism has become the U.S. imperialists' number one accomplice. Recently, they have been jointly plotting a new "bomb to pressure and stop bombing to deceive" conspiracy and attempting to use the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnamese question. The U.S. imperialists' peace talks conspiracy has failed many times, and any new peace talks conspiracy will also be doomed to fail.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the seven hundred million Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will forever follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, fully support the Vietnamese people to carry the war of resistance against the U.S. imperialists to the end, and are determined to unite with the Vietnamese people, fight together, and defeat the U.S. aggressors completely.

Those invited to attend the reception also included leading comrades from various government departments, the General Staff, various military branches, and the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing. Among them were Xiao Jinguang, Wang Shusheng, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Wen Yucheng, Qiu Huizuo, Zhang Chuming, Li Zuopeng, Wang Hongkun, Zhang Xiuchuan, Yu Lijin, Liu Jinping, Zheng Weishan, Li Siguang, Fang Yi, Luo Guibo, Lin Haicun, Han Nianlong, Ding Xilin, and Nie Yuanzi.

Ambassadors from various countries to China and other foreign friends were also invited to attend the reception. (Accompanying photo)

    阮文广团长在庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年招待会上说
    敬爱的毛主席给予我们极大的鼓舞力量  南越军民决心紧握手中枪同美帝打到底
    周恩来陈伯达康生李富春李先念谢富治杨成武等同志到会热烈祝贺
    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，美帝妄图扩大战争挽救败局完全是痴心妄想，美帝及其帮凶玩弄新的“和谈”骗局也注定要失败
    新华社二十日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，今天晚上举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年，热烈欢庆越南人民在抗美救国战争中取得的伟大胜利。
    周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、陈毅、李先念、谢富治、杨成武、吴法宪、汪东兴、郭沫若、刘宁一等负责同志，应邀出席了招待会。
    以阮春龙为首的越南南方人民代表团，越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾，和在京的其他越南朋友，出席了招待会。
    招待会开始时，军乐队奏中华人民共和国国歌和越南南方民族解放阵线歌曲《解放南方》。
    阮文广团长和陈毅副总理在招待会上先后讲了话。阮文广在讲话中说，在庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的欢腾气氛中，越南南方所有各战场上的军民，万分激动地和荣幸地听到了一个振奋人心的喜讯：敬爱的毛泽东主席给阮友寿主席致了贺电。越南南方人民把中国人民的伟大领袖、越南人民的伟大战友毛主席的强有力的支持，当作极大的鼓舞力量。越南南方全体解放军战士和全体人民，怀着对毛主席的深切感激，带着毛主席的贺电给予的新的力量，将奋勇前进，向美帝国主义及其走狗头上，打得更狠、打得更准，以圆满地完成自己的历史任务，不辜负敬爱的毛主席的信赖。
    阮文广介绍了越南南方人民在抗美救国战争中不断取得的新胜利，介绍了越南南方民族解放阵线中央非常会议通过的政治纲领的重大意义，介绍了越南南方民族解放阵线的国际威望日益提高的情况。他说，越南南方人民七年来所取得的胜利，是越南南方民族解放阵线正确的政治和军事路线的胜利，是在越南南方高度发展的人民战争的胜利，是从北到南的全体越南人民决战决胜意志的胜利。
    他谴责已经遭到沉重失败并且变得更加疯狂的美帝国主义，正在极力扩大侵略越南南方的战争，把对越南北方的破坏性战争“升级”到最高一级，谴责美帝国主义连续地以军事进攻来侵略柬埔寨领土，不断发动对柬埔寨进行诬蔑和威胁的战役。并且加强在老挝的战争，在印度支那和东南亚制造非常紧张的局势。
    他说，美帝国主义为了掩盖其加强和扩大战争的阴谋，不断提出“和平谈判”，阴谋用联合国来干涉越南问题。他说，美帝国主义欺骗不了任何人。联合国无权干涉越南问题。越南南方军民决心紧握手中枪战斗到底，以便实现民族解放阵线政治纲领中明确指出的目标，最圆满地完成对亲爱的越南祖国的神圣任务，即解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国。
    阮文广团长说，中国人民为实现毛主席的指示：“中国人民是坚决支持越南南方人民的正义斗争的”，已经作出一切努力来支援越南南方人民抗美救国的斗争。越南南方军民对兄弟的中国人民的全心全意的支援评价很高，把它看作对越南人民在自己神圣的救国事业中的极大鼓舞和重要贡献。趁此机会，我再次代表越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南南方全体军民，向敬爱的毛主席、中国共产党和政府，表示衷心的感谢。越南南方人民誓与中国人民永远并肩在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    阮文广说，越南南方的形势为越南南方人民的斗争事业揭示了非常灿烂的前途。越南南方人民坚信，在民族解放阵线政治纲领的光辉照耀下，在一千四百万越南南方人民唯一的真正代表越南南方民族解放阵线的正确领导下，以全民团结的力量和战斗的决心，与自己骨肉的北方同胞同心协力，并得到中国人民和世界各国人民的同情和支持，越南南方人民一定取得胜利。越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领一定能够实现。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中代表中国政府和中国人民，向越南南方民族解放阵线主席团和英雄的越南南方人民，表示最热烈的祝贺。他说，不久以前，越南南方民族解放阵线发表的政治纲领，进一步动员和团结了越南南方人民，表达了越南南方人民同美帝国主义战斗到底的决心。越南南方民族解放阵线是一千四百万越南南方人民唯一的真正的代表，是越南南方人民最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实的旗手。
    陈毅副总理赞扬越南南北两方军民，同仇敌忾，相互支援，给了美帝国主义以致命的打击。他说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“战争教育了人民，人民将赢得战争，赢得和平，又赢得进步”。越南南北方人民在战斗中得到锻炼，越战越强，他们团结一致，共同对敌，这是一道坚不可摧的铜墙铁壁。
    陈毅副总理说，越南人民的抗美救国战争，向全世界革命人民提供了一个极其重要的经验，说明美帝国主义是没有办法对付人民战争的。我们伟大领袖毛主席在给阮友寿主席的贺电中指出：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。越南人民在伟大领袖胡志明主席的英明领导下进行的抗美救国战争，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。”
    他说，美帝国主义现在不仅继续增兵越南南方，加紧轰炸越南北方，而且还叫嚷要把战争扩大到柬埔寨和老挝。它在国内外加紧搜罗炮灰，一直动员到完全追随它的日本军国主义分子。在它的指使下，最近佐藤反动政府竟然公开发出歇斯底里的反华战争叫嚣。美帝国主义妄图用扩大战争来挽救败局，这完全是痴心妄想。如果美帝国主义硬要一意孤行，中国人民将坚决同越南人民、柬埔寨人民、老挝人民和亚洲各国人民站在一起，给美国侵略者以沉重的打击，把美帝国主义这只纸老虎投入人民战争的烈火中，烧成灰烬。
    他说，美帝国主义在越南的处境越是困难，它就越要在进行军事冒险的同时，加紧推行和谈骗局。在这个阴谋中，现代修正主义充当了美帝国主义的头号帮凶。最近，他们又在共同策划新的“以炸压和”、“停炸诱和”阴谋，并企图利用联合国干涉越南问题。美帝国主义的和谈阴谋已经多次破产，现在玩弄任何新的和谈骗局，也是注定要失败的。
    陈毅副总理最后说，经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，将永远遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，全力支援越南人民将抗美救国战争进行到底，决心同兄弟的越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，直到彻底打败美国侵略者。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有政府各部门的负责人，中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种的负责人，北京市革命委员会的负责人。他们当中有萧劲光、王树声、李天佑、王新亭、温玉成、邱会作、张池明、李作鹏、王宏坤、张秀川、余立金、刘锦平、郑维山、李四光、方毅、罗贵波、林海云、韩念龙、丁西林、聂元梓等。
