Representatives of the Navy's First Conference on Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works, with hearts filled with immense excitement, warmly hailed the decision by our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao to personally approve the conferment of the titles of Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, Model of Leftist Support and Love for the People. They set a new shining example for us. Everyone said, this is the latest directive from our great leader Chairman Mao to the entire army and the nation, the greatest care, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest spur. They expressed their determination to unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's new battle command, taking "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, to be like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, with unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao step by step, responding promptly to all of Chairman Mao's latest directives, learning Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, transforming thoughts for a lifetime, serving the people wholeheartedly, and forever following Chairman Mao in revolution.

	Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao is the Highest Standard of the Communist Worldview

Representatives unanimously pointed out in the discussion that during the arduous years of the anti-Japanese war, Chairman Mao personally set the eternal example of Zhang Zedong for us; during the War of Liberation, Chairman Mao personally set the heroic image of Liu Hulan for us, writing the sublime praise "Great in life, glorious in death"; in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country, Chairman Mao personally set the shining example of Lei Feng for us, issuing the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng"; today, our great leader Chairman Mao has personally set the shining new model of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong for us, radiating the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. These heroes, although appearing in different eras, are all the result of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought nurturing them. They share a common essence, which is unlimited loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao.

Zheng Yimin, political commissar of a unit in the East China Fleet, said: The Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong are new heroes of the times. Unlimited loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest public spirit and the highest standard for establishing a proletarian worldview. The Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, above all, are precious for their unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao step by step. We learn from the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, learning a thousand times, ten thousand times, to be like them, with unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

High Xiang, commander of the "Sea and Air Eagles Squadron," spoke about his personal experience of breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit in the battle of shooting down an American F-104 aircraft: As long as we have a heart that is unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, in battle, we can cast aside all selfish thoughts, fearlessly face death, and overcome all enemies. We learn from the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, taking unlimited loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao as the highest standard for breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit, resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," consciously triggering a revolution in the depths of our souls, thoroughly uprooting the foundation of the bourgeois "self" in our minds, and building a great wall of proletarian "public spirit."

	Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao Means Breaking Selfishness and Establishing Public Spirit in Major Matters

Representatives said that the moving deeds of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong collectively show that to be unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must break selfishness and establish public spirit in major matters, raising our class struggle awareness and line struggle consciousness. Grasping major matters means grasping political direction, political line, class stance, and revolutionary spirit. Especially grasping our attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by grasping this major matter can we break selfishness at the crux and establish public spirit at the root.

Li Dezhen, chief of staff of a unit in the South China Fleet, said: Grasping major matters, raising breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit to the height of the struggle between the two lines, is the direction and standard for breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit. Breaking selfishness and establishing public spirit means thoroughly breaking all selfish thoughts that hinder our understanding and execution of the directives of our great leader Chairman Mao, thoroughly breaking all non-proletarian thoughts that hinder us from following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, such as individualism, seeking fame, cliquism, and anarchism, and firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, ensuring that every directive and battle command from the great helmsman Chairman Mao is unconditionally and resolutely executed.

Wang Jingnan, a technician in a unit of the North China Fleet, said: Learning the great deeds of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, I further realized that in the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, as long as we have the red heart of "defending Chairman Mao, even if we die, we are willing," our minds will have the greatest "public spirit," and we can firmly unite, fight, and win with the revolutionary left.

	Only Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao Can Continuously Achieve New Merits for the People

Representatives deeply understood after learning the heroic deeds of the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong that true revolutionaries are most loyal to Chairman Mao. Only by being forever loyal to Chairman Mao can we continuously achieve new merits for the revolution and the people.

Wu Yi, commander of a brigade in the South China Fleet, linked his thirty years of revolutionary practice with Chairman Mao: The heroic deeds of the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong once again vividly tell us that those who are unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao are the most loyal to the masses and the revolutionary cause. Those who are unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, no matter when, where, or under what circumstances, can bravely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and firmly support the broad revolutionary masses, fearing neither bloodshed nor sacrifice.

Maci Deng, deputy political instructor of a submarine and a first-class merit awardee, Chen Wenyi, said, why do the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong have such great courage and strength? It is because they are unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, unconditionally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The boundless Mao Zedong Thought is the rain and sunshine for the growth of revolutionary soldiers, the source of wisdom and strength, and the magic weapon for victory. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to revolutionize.

Everyone resolutely declared that they would, with the greatest determination, the fastest speed, and the highest standards, unconditionally learn the heroic virtues and sublime spirit of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong. Forever, like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, be unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao step by step, forever loyal to the great helmsman Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and forever sail on the red course opened by Chairman Mao.

    红心永向红太阳　步步紧跟毛主席
    ——海军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表学习座谈四排和李文忠英雄事迹
    海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表，怀着万分激动的心情，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自批准授予英雄四排和李文忠支左爱民模范称号，为我们树立了新的光辉榜样。大家说，这是伟大领袖毛主席向全军、全国发出的又一最新指示，是对我们的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大教育、最大鞭策。他们表示，一定不折不扣地执行毛主席这一新的战斗号令，以“斗私，批修”为纲，象英雄四排和李文忠那样，对毛主席赤胆忠心，紧跟毛主席寸步不离，对毛主席的一切最新指示，都要闻风而动，立竿见影。学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，全心全意为人民服务，永远跟毛主席干革命。
      无限忠于毛主席是共产主义世界观的最高标准
    代表们在座谈中一致指出，在抗日战争的艰苦年代里，毛主席亲自为我们树立了张思德这个千古不朽的光辉榜样；解放战争时期，毛主席亲自为我们树立了刘胡兰的英雄形象，写下了“生的伟大，死的光荣”的崇高赞语；在我国进入社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，毛主席亲自为我们树立了雷锋这个光辉的典范，发出了“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召；今天，伟大领袖毛主席又亲自为我们树立了英雄四排和李文忠这个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新标兵。这些英雄尽管出现的年代不同，但是他们都是光焰无际的毛泽东思想哺育的结果，在他们身上有着一个共同的本质，这就是无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席。
    东海舰队某部政委张逸民说：英雄四排和李文忠是时代的新英雄。无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席是最大的公，是树立无产阶级世界观的最高标准。英雄四排和李文忠，千可贵，万可贵，就贵在他们对毛主席赤胆忠心，紧跟毛主席寸步不离。我们向英雄四排和李文忠学习，千学习，万学习，就是要象他们那样，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
      “海空雄鹰团”大队长高翔谈到自己在击落美国F—104飞机战斗中破私立公的亲身体会时说：只要我们有一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心，在战斗中，就能抛掉一切私心杂念，就能勇敢不怕死，压倒一切敌人。我们向英雄四排和李文忠学习，就要以无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席作为破私立公的最高标准，坚决响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命，在头脑里彻底挖掉资产阶级“私”字的根基，筑起无产阶级“公”字的长城。
    无限忠于毛主席就要在大节上破私立公
    代表们说，英雄四排和李文忠的动人事迹集中地说明了我们要无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的革命路线，就必须在大节上破私立公，提高阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟。抓大节就是抓政治方向、政治路线、阶级立场、革命干劲。特别是抓对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的态度。只有抓住这个大节，才能破私破在要害处，立公立在根本上。
    南海舰队某部参谋长李德宪说：抓大节，把破私立公提高到两条路线斗争的高度，是破私立公的方向，破私立公的标准。破私立公，就要大破特破妨碍我们理解和执行伟大领袖毛主席指示的各种私心杂念，大破特破妨碍我们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的个人主义、风头主义、小团体主义、无政府主义等非无产阶级思想，大树特树毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的绝对权威，做到对伟大统帅毛主席的每一个指示、每一个战斗命令，都不折不扣地坚决执行。
    北海舰队某部技术员王景南说：学习了英雄四排和李文忠的伟大事迹，使我进一步体会到，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大搏斗中，只要我们有“保卫毛主席，死了也甘心”的赤胆忠心，头脑里就有了最大的“公”，就能坚定地同革命左派团结、战斗、胜利在一起。
      对毛主席无限忠诚才能不断为人民立新功
    代表们学习四排和李文忠英雄事迹后深刻认识到，真正的革命者最忠于毛主席。只有永远忠于毛主席，才能为革命，为人民不断立新功。
    南海舰队某部支队长武毅联系三十年来跟毛主席闹革命的战斗实践时说：四排和李文忠英雄事迹再一次生动地告诉我们，无限忠于毛主席的人，就是最忠于人民群众、最忠于革命事业的人。无限忠于毛主席的人，无论在什么时候，在什么地方，在什么情况下，都能勇敢地捍卫毛主席的革命路线，坚定地支持广大革命群众，不怕流血牺牲。
    麦贤得所在艇副指导员、一等功荣立者陈文乙说，英雄四排和李文忠，为什么会有这么大的勇敢，这么大的力量？就是因为他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。光焰无际的毛泽东思想是我们革命战士成长的雨露阳光，智慧和力量的源泉，克敌制胜的法宝，我们干革命靠的就是毛泽东思想。
    大家坚决表示，一定要以最大的决心，最快的速度，最高的标准，不折不扣地把英雄四排和李文忠的英雄品德和崇高精神，真正学到手。永远象英雄四排和李文忠那样，对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离，永远忠于伟大的舵手毛主席，永远忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，永远航行在毛主席开辟的红色航道上。
