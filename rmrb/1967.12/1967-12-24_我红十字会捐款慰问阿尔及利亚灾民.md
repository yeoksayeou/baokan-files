The Chinese Embassy in Algeria's Chargé d'affaires Chen Jinlong handed over 40,000 Algerian dinars and a letter of condolences from the Chinese Red Cross to the Chairman of the Algerian Red Crescent, Murad Belaouni, on December 21. This donation is intended to help the Algerian people who have recently suffered from floods.

Belaouni expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Red Cross and the Chinese people for their assistance to the Algerian disaster victims. He said, "The friendship between the peoples of Algeria and China has a long history. The Chinese people are friends who share our joys and sorrows. We often recall the great assistance provided by the People's Republic of China during our national liberation struggle, which made a significant contribution to our cause. Today, your donation will help many of our disaster victims."

In December, almost the entire country of Algeria was hit by storms, with the eastern region particularly severely affected, resulting in significant loss of life and property.

    我红十字会捐款慰问阿尔及利亚灾民
    新华社阿尔及尔二十一日电　中国驻阿尔及利亚大使馆临时代办陈金龙，二十一日把中国红十字会捐给最近遭受水灾的阿尔及利亚灾民的四万阿尔及利亚第纳尔和一封慰问信，转给阿尔及利亚红新月会主席穆拉德·贝拉乌尼，表达中国人民对阿尔及利亚灾民的关怀。
    贝拉乌尼对中国红十字会和中国人民给予阿尔及利亚灾民的援助表示衷心的感谢。他说：“阿中两国人民之间的友谊有悠久的历史。中国人民是和我们同甘共苦的朋友。我们时常想起伟大的中华人民共和国在我们民族解放战争时期给予的援助，这种援助，对我们的事业是十分重大的贡献。今天，你们的捐款使我国的很多灾民能得到救济。”
    十二月来，阿尔及利亚全境都几乎遭到暴风雨的袭击，特别是东部地区，灾情尤其严重，造成了生命财产的重大损失。
