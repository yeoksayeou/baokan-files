Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, our most beloved red sun, Chairman Mao, recently sent a congratulatory telegram to the Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho. This telegram fully expresses the resolve of the 700 million Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist America, and it brilliantly points out the path to victory for the world revolution.

In the telegram, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The 700 million Chinese people are the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. In the face of the ironclad combat unity of the peoples of our two countries, any military adventurism and political deception by American imperialism is doomed to failure."

Chairman Mao's telegram is a mobilization order to us, the proletarian revolutionary faction, calling on us to further shoulder the responsibility of aiding Vietnam and resisting America. We enthusiastically respond to the call of our great leader, Chairman Mao, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and national salvation, and regarding this support as our inexorable internationalist duty.

We are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao, through to the end, making our socialist motherland even stronger, so that we can more powerfully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and national salvation. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, resolutely implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," actively increase the production of materials needed by our Vietnamese brothers, and help the Vietnamese brothers to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors as soon as possible.

Victory to Vietnam! Defeat to American imperialism!

   上海市食品公司革命委员会
    我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，最近给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿的贺电，最充分地表达了我们七亿中国人民援越抗美的决心，最英明地指出了世界革命走向胜利的道路。
    毛主席在贺电中指出：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。在我们两国人民坚强的战斗团结面前，美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗都是注定要失败的。”
    毛主席的贺电是对我们无产阶级革命派发出的动员令，号召我们进一步担负起援越抗美的重任。我们热烈地响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国战争，并把这一支援当作自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。
    我们一定决心将毛主席亲手发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使我们的社会主义祖国更加强大，能够更加有力地支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，坚决贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，积极增产支援越南兄弟需要的物资，使越南兄弟早日彻底打败美国侵略者。
    越南必胜！美帝必败！
