The "Exhibition in Memory of White" Tour

In the midst of the nationwide people's fervent response to Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and the surge of the campaign to criticize and repudiate revisionism, on the 28th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," the Beijing Military Area Command of the People's Liberation Army held an exhibition in memory of White.

Upon entering the exhibition hall, visitors first see a giant statue of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese and world peoples, and the full text of "In Memory of Norman Bethune" set against a red velvet background. Following this, a series of photographs and precious artifacts reflecting the brilliant deeds of the great internationalist warrior, Comrade White, are displayed before the visitors.

	“Glory! Glory! The Chinese people
	Have Chairman Mao and are glorious!
		Happiness! Happiness! The Chinese people
	Have Chairman Mao and are happy!”

Comrade White was born in 1890 in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Communist Party of Canada and a world-renowned thoracic surgeon. After the outbreak of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression on July 7, 1937, he decided to come to China, to the great leader Mao Zedong and the great Chinese Communist Party-led anti-Japanese base areas. He said, "That is the place most in need, where I can be most useful!" In the spring of 1938, Comrade White, "to help China's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, was sent by the Communist Party of Canada and the Communist Party of the USA, traveling thousands of miles to China."

From the moment he arrived in Yan'an, Comrade White eagerly hoped to meet the great leader Chairman Mao. The most striking exhibit in the exhibition is a large color oil painting of Chairman Mao receiving Comrade White: under the Pagoda Mountain and by the Yanhe River, in a simple cave dwelling, the great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong received the internationalist warrior White and had a cordial conversation with him. White looked at Chairman Mao with happiness, listening attentively to Chairman Mao's words, his face filled with boundless admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao.

In another painting, people see: it is deep into the night, and White is too excited to sleep. He picks up his pen and records this unforgettable meeting. Above this painting, in bold red letters, is a excerpt from White's diary recording this meeting:

	“In that room without furnishings, sitting opposite Chairman Mao, listening to his calm and composed speech, I thought of the Long March, of how Chairman Mao led the Red Army through a 25,000-li journey from the south to the northwest, to the yellow earth of the mountains, and due to his strategic experience at that time, they were able to use guerrilla warfare to harass the Japanese army, rendering the invaders' superior weapons ineffective, thus saving China. I now understand why Chairman Mao moves every person who meets him. He is a giant, one of the greatest figures in the world.”

The meeting between the greatest teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and White, gave White immense encouragement and boundless strength, broadening the horizons of this internationalist warrior. From then on, Comrade White often excitedly told his Chinese and foreign friends: "Glory! Glory! The Chinese people have Chairman Mao and are glorious! Happiness! Happiness! The Chinese people have Chairman Mao and are happy!"

	“Wise, wise, Chairman Mao is truly a great helmsman!”

With the great encouragement from Chairman Mao, White "took the cause of liberating the Chinese people as his own," changed into the gray uniform of the Eighth Route Army, rode a horse east across the Yellow River towards the hot battlefields of Jin-Cha-Ji, and rushed to the front lines.

The first thing Comrade White did upon arriving in the Jin-Cha-Ji border area was to ask for work. His first words were, "Where are the wounded?" In his first week, he examined 520 wounded and sick soldiers. In his first month, he successfully performed surgery on 147 wounded and sick soldiers. His first initiative was to organize a volunteer blood donation team and voluntarily donated 300 milliliters of his own blood to a soldier. He told his comrades with fiery passion, "To serve such soldiers is my greatest joy and happiness!"

In the exhibition hall, visitors see the photocopy of Comrade White's speech at the dedication ceremony of the model hospital and listen carefully to the guide's detailed explanation. To greatly improve the treatment of wounded soldiers, Comrade White led a five-week intensive campaign, transforming a poorly equipped medical station into a relatively regular and fixed model hospital.

The guide points to a set of precious photographs and introduces to the visitors: at the dedication ceremony of this hospital, Comrade White delivered a speech full of internationalist and communist spirit and performed a surgical demonstration. However, the "model hospital" was soon destroyed by the Japanese fascists. White angrily said, "I underestimated the brutality of the fascist bandits. The Japanese bandits are too despicable!" How could medical and health work better adapt to the characteristics of guerrilla warfare against Japan and better serve the people's soldiers? Comrade White, with this question in mind, with the help of the unit leaders and comrades, carefully studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Prolonged War."

Several color paintings in the exhibition hall show the scene of Comrade White, guided by the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, with the help of leaders and comrades, and after a period of practice, rebuilding a "special surgical hospital." This hospital fully adapts to the characteristics of people's war; the people's homes are the hospitals; the people's kang beds are the beds for the wounded; the hospital is built among the people, and the enemy can never destroy it.

The guide excitedly introduces to the visitors a sentence Comrade White said when reviewing his journey:

	“Wise, wise, Chairman Mao is truly a great helmsman!”

	“I am a communist warrior and should not
	Have any special privileges”

The great internationalist warrior Comrade White, "with no selfish motives, took the cause of liberating the Chinese people as his own," and worked selflessly. In his work, he always set high standards and strictly demanded of himself, unconditionally giving everything he had. However, in his life, he was frugal and asked for nothing.

Many exhibits in the exhibition hall are true reflections of the living conditions of this great internationalist warrior. In the difficult days of war, Comrade White, like the Eighth Route Army soldiers, had thin clothes and blankets, but when he saw that the wounded lacked blankets, he hugged his own blanket and sent it over. Once, the leadership, to take care of Comrade White's health, sent him two bowls of chicken soup, which he immediately sent to the ward and personally fed to the wounded soldier, mouthful by mouthful. On the path where the wounded soldiers passed every day, the steps were broken, and Comrade White personally repaired the road.

The guide points to one photo after another, one painting after another, and introduces to the visitors in a tone of admiration: In the Jin-Cha-Ji border area, Comrade White lived in a civilian house, ate corn and black beans, and wore coarse military uniforms. He also carried a needle case like the Eighth Route Army soldiers and mended his clothes himself. When the leadership or comrades took the initiative to take care of him, he said seriously, "I came from Yan'an. I know that Chairman Mao's allowance is very little, and the Eighth Route Army only has a few cents of vegetable money per day. I am a communist warrior and should not have any special privileges."

Our great leader Chairman Mao showed great concern and care for the internationalist warrior Comrade White. On a white lacquered board in the exhibition hall, in bold red letters, is the instruction from the great leader Chairman Mao to the then commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji border area, Comrade Nie Rongzhen, to take good care of Comrade White. After receiving the instruction conveyed by Comrade Nie, Comrade White wrote a letter to the beloved Chairman Mao that night. This letter is written in bold red letters on another white lacquered board. In the letter, Comrade White expresses his happiness and excitement to Chairman Mao: to struggle together with the border area military and civilians to the end!

In the struggle with the Chinese people, Comrade White's lofty communist ideals became even more firm, and his thoughts reached the sublime realm of selflessness. In the letters he left behind to his friends in Canada, there are words like: "The life here is quite hard, and sometimes very difficult, but I am very happy." "I have no money and do not need money, but I am very lucky to be able to work with these people."

	“Please convey to Chairman Mao, thanking him and the
	Chinese Communist Party for their education”

On the afternoon of October 21, 1939, Comrade White was working intensely in a small temple near the front line to rescue the wounded. Unfortunately, his left middle finger was pierced by a scalpel.

Later, Comrade White, while rescuing a wounded soldier with erysipelas infection, was infected with deadly bacteria through the pierced finger. He fell ill, with a temperature of 39.6 degrees Celsius.

In his illness, Comrade White repeatedly asked to go to the front line. Comrades tried to dissuade him. White anxiously said, "I am extremely worried about the soldiers bleeding on the front line." "This little finger injury is nothing, I can still work... You should use me as a top-notch machine gun!" On November 10, Comrade White's condition worsened. Commander Nie Rongzhen sent a message, ordering the unit to spare no effort to save Comrade White's life. The military region's health department specially dispatched doctors to rush to the scene and took all emergency measures, but it was to no avail.

What was Comrade White thinking in his final moments?

He thought of the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

He thought of the cause of liberating the Chinese people!

The guide points to a large charcoal sketch and introduces to the visitors the scene of the great internationalist warrior's final moments: It was already deep into the night. He was breathing heavily. Suddenly, he sat up, looked at the comrades beside him, and said with boundless excitement, "Please convey to Chairman Mao, thanking him and the Chinese Communist Party for their education." "I believe that the Chinese people will definitely be liberated, it is a pity that I cannot personally see the birth of New China!"

Immediately, the visitors see from another painting that White, holding a pen, struggled to write a letter to Commander Nie Rongzhen. This letter is exhibited as an exhibit, and its translation is:

	Dear Commander Nie,
	Today, I feel very bad, perhaps I will have to say goodbye to you forever...
	Please convey to the Communist Party of Canada and the American people, tell them I am very happy, my only hope is to be able to contribute more...
	Norman Bethune

The guide continues to introduce to the visitors in an excited tone: Comrade White had just handed the written letter to the translator when he fainted again. When he slowly regained consciousness, he held the doctor's hand and said intermittently, "Please convey to Commander Nie, suggesting that he immediately organize a medical team to approach the front line and receive the wounded..." The doctor, with tears in his eyes, told him that everything was arranged, and please rest assured. White struggled to breathe. He raised his head again and firmly said to the Chinese comrades standing by his side, his last words:

	“Strive on! Towards the great path, open up the future!”

On the morning of November 12, 1939, the outstanding son of the Canadian people, the great internationalist warrior Norman Bethune, sacrificed his precious life for the cause of liberating the Chinese and world peoples.

The visitors, with heavy and respectful hearts, paid their respects to the portrait of Comrade White and learned from the great leader Chairman Mao's inscription for Comrade White: "Save the dying and help the wounded, practice revolutionary humanitarianism." They shouted slogans such as "Learn from Comrade White" and "Long live the 'Three Articles'!" They reviewed Chairman Mao's eulogy at the Yan'an memorial meeting for Comrade White: "Learn from Comrade White's international spirit, learn from his spirit of self-sacrifice, sense of responsibility, and work enthusiasm."

On December 21, 1939, Chairman Mao wrote the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

Twenty-eight years have passed. Chairman Mao's great call to learn from Comrade White has resounded throughout China and the world like thunder, and generation after generation of new people have grown up rapidly.

Today, when people come to visit the "Exhibition in Memory of White," the spirit of selflessness and dedication of the great internationalist warrior Comrade White, and the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao in "In Memory of Norman Bethune," deeply inspire everyone. They regard the "Exhibition in Memory of White" as a good classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Some revolutionary masses held "criticism meetings" on the spot during the visit, using Comrade White's "selflessness" as a standard. The visitors expressed that they would definitely take Comrade White as a shining example, use the "Three Articles" as a weapon of thought, constantly criticize and repudiate revisionism, transform their worldview, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade White will forever live in the hearts of the revolutionary people of China and the world. His great communist spirit will shine like the sun and moon, forever inspiring people to advance bravely for the revolutionary cause of the world's people.

    无限热爱毛主席的国际主义战士白求恩
    “纪念白求恩展览”巡礼
    在全国人民紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，掀起斗私批修活动的高潮中，在毛主席的光辉文献《纪念白求恩》发表二十八周年的日子里，人民解放军北京部队领导机关举办的“纪念白求恩展览”，正式展出了。
    走进展览馆，观众首先看到的是中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席的巨型全身塑像，和嵌在红色绒布上的金光闪闪的《纪念白求恩》全文。接着，反映伟大国际主义战士白求恩同志光辉事迹的一幅幅图片和一件件珍贵实物，展现在观众面前。
          “光荣！光荣！中国人民
      有了毛泽东就是光荣！
          幸福！幸福！中国人民
      有了毛泽东就是幸福！”
    白求恩同志一八九○年生于加拿大安大略州，是加拿大共产党党员，世界著名的胸外科专家。一九三七年七月七日中国抗日战争爆发后，他就下定决心，到中国来，到伟大的领袖毛泽东同志和伟大的中国共产党领导的抗日根据地来。他说：“那是需要最迫切的地方，是我能够最有用的地方！”一九三八年春天，白求恩同志“为了帮助中国的抗日战争，受加拿大共产党和美国共产党的派遣，不远万里，来到中国。”白求恩同志从到延安的第一天起，就渴望见到伟大领袖毛主席。
    在展览中，最引人注目的是毛主席接见白求恩同志的巨幅彩色油画：在宝塔山下，延水河畔，一个简朴的窑洞里，伟大的革命导师毛泽东同志接见了国际主义战士白求恩，和他进行了亲切的谈话。白求恩同志幸福地注视着毛主席，聚精会神地倾听着毛主席的谈话，他的脸上，充满了对伟大领袖毛主席无限敬仰的神色。
    在另一幅画上，人们看到：夜深了，白求恩兴奋得没有入睡。他提起笔来，记下这次永远难忘的会见。在这幅画的正上方，用醒目的红字写着白求恩同志记录这次会见的日记摘抄：
      “我在那间没有陈设的房间里和毛泽东同志对面坐着，倾听着他那从容不迫的言谈的时候，我回想到长征，想到毛泽东同志在那伟大的行军中怎样领着红军经过二万五千里的长途跋涉，从南方来到西北丛山里的黄土地带，由于他当年的战略经验，使得他们能以游击战来困扰日军，使侵略者的优越武器失去效力，从而挽救中国。我现在明白，为什么毛泽东同志那样感动着每一个和他见面的人，这是一个巨人，他是我们世界上最伟大的人物之一。”
    世界革命人民最伟大的导师毛主席同白求恩的会见，给了白求恩以巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量，开阔了这位国际主义战士的胸怀。从此以后，白求恩同志经常兴奋地对他的中外朋友说：“光荣！光荣！中国人民有了毛泽东就是光荣！幸福！幸福！中国人民有了毛泽东就是幸福！”	  “英明，英明，毛泽东真是伟大的舵手！”
    白求恩同志带着毛主席给他的巨大鼓舞，“把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业”，换上八路军的灰军装，迎着朝阳，骑着骏马东渡黄河，奔赴火热的晋察冀前线。
    白求恩同志到晋察冀边区的第一件事是要求工作，第一句话是“伤员在哪里？”第一周就检查了五百二十名伤病员，第一个月就成功地为一百四十七名伤病员做了手术，第一个倡议是组织志愿输血队，并主动给一个战士输了自己的三百毫升鲜血。他怀着火一样的感情对同志们说：“为这样的战士服务，是我最大的快乐和幸福！”
    在展览馆里，观众看着白求恩同志《在模范医院落成典礼上的讲话》的影印手稿，仔细地听讲解员详细讲解。为了大力改进伤员的救治工作，白求恩同志带头开展了一个突击性的“五星期运动”，把一个设备简陋的医疗所，改建成了一个比较正规、固定的模范医院。
    讲解员指着一组珍贵照片向观众介绍：在这座医院落成典礼上，白求恩同志发表了一篇洋溢着国际主义和共产主义精神的讲话，并作了手术示范。可是，“模范医院”刚建成不久，就被日本法西斯破坏了。白求恩非常气愤地说：“我低估了法西斯匪徒的残暴，日本强盗太可恶了！”怎样才能使医疗卫生工作更适应抗日游击战争的特点，更好地为人民子弟兵服务？白求恩同志带着这个问题，在部队首长和同志们的帮助下，认真学习了毛主席的《论持久战》等光辉著作。
    展览馆里的几幅彩色图画，展现了白求恩同志以伟大的毛泽东思想为指导，在领导和同志们的帮助下，又经过一段实践，重新建设了一个“特种外科医院”的情景。这个医院充分适应人民战争的特点，群众的家，就是医院；群众的炕头，就是伤员的病床；把医院建立在群众之中，敌人永远破坏不了。
    讲解员激动地向观众介绍白求恩同志在回顾自己走过的这一段道路时的一句话：
    “英明，英明，毛泽东真是伟大的舵手！”
        “我是个共产主义战士，不应
    有任何特殊享受”
    伟大的国际主义战士白求恩同志，“毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业”，忘我地工作着。在工作上他总是高标准地严格要求自己，无条件地献出自己的一切。但是在生活上，他却艰苦朴素，毫无所求。
    展览馆里的许多展品，是这位伟大国际主义战士当年生活情景的真实写照。在烽火连天的艰苦岁月里，白求恩同志和八路军战士一样衣单被薄，但当他看到伤员被子不够用，就抱起自己的被子送去。有一次，领导为了照顾白求恩同志的健康，给他送来两碗鸡汤，他立即送到病房，亲手一口一口地喂到伤员嘴里，在伤员天天来往的路上，台阶坏了，白求恩同志就亲自动手，把路修好。
    讲解员指着一张张照片，一幅幅画图，用敬佩的语调向观众介绍：白求恩同志在晋察冀边区，住的是民房，吃的是小米、黑豆，穿的是粗布军装。他还象八路军战士那样，身上带着针线包，衣服破了自己补。当领导或同志们主动照顾他的时候，他严肃地说：“我从延安来，我知道毛主席的津贴很少，八路军每天只有几分钱的菜金，我是个共产主义战士，不应有任何特殊享受。”
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，对国际主义战士白求恩同志非常关怀、爱护。展览馆的一块白漆牌上，用鲜红的大字书写着伟大领袖毛主席要原晋察冀边区司令员聂荣臻同志很好地关心照顾白求恩同志的指示。白求恩同志接到聂司令员传达的指示后，当晚给敬爱的毛主席写了一封回信。这封信用鲜红的大字书写在另一块白漆牌上，白求恩同志在信中满怀幸福和激动的心情向毛主席表示：永远同边区军民一道，艰苦奋斗到底！
    白求恩同志在和中国人民并肩战斗中，更加坚定了崇高的共产主义理想，他的思想达到了一心为公的崇高境界。在他遗留下来的给在加拿大的朋友的一些信里，有着这样的话：“这里生活相当苦，而且有时候非常艰难，但是我过得很快乐。”“我没有钱，也不需要钱，可是我万分幸运，能够到这些人中间和他们一起工作。”
        “请转告毛主席，感谢他和
    中国共产党对我的教育”
    一九三九年十月二十一日下午，白求恩同志在临近火线的一座小庙里，为抢救伤员紧张地工作着。不料，他的左手中指被手术刀刺破。
    后来，白求恩同志为抢救一个患丹毒感染的伤员，被手术刀刺破的手指又受到致命的毒菌的感染。他病倒了，体温高达三十九度六。
    白求恩同志在病中，一再要求到前线去，同志们纷纷劝阻他。白求恩着急地说：“我十二分忧虑的是前方流血的战士。”“手指这点小病算什么，我可以照样工作，……你们要拿我当一挺顶呱呱的机关枪使用！”
    十一月十日，白求恩同志病情恶化了。聂荣臻司令员派人送来急信，要部队不惜任何代价，抢救白求恩同志的生命。军区卫生部特派医生星夜赶到，采取了一切紧急措施，但仍然无效。
    白求恩同志在生命的最后时刻想的是什么？
    他想的是最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席！
    他想的是中国人民的解放事业！
    讲解员指着一幅大型炭笔素描画，向观众介绍这位伟大的国际主义战士生命的最后时刻的情景：夜，已经很深了。他沉重地呼吸着。忽然，他坐了起来，望着身旁的同志们，无限激动地说：“请转告毛主席，感谢他和中国共产党对我的教育。”“我相信，中国人民一定会获得解放，遗憾的是我不能亲自看到新中国的诞生！”
    紧接着，观众从另一幅画上看到，白求恩提着笔，吃力地给聂荣臻司令员写信。这封信的照片作为展品展出，它的译文是：亲爱的聂司令员：
    今天，我感觉非常不好，也许就要和你们永别了，……
    请你转告加拿大共产党和美国人民，告诉他们我十分快乐，我唯一的希望是能够多有贡献……。
                              诺尔曼·白求恩
    讲解员继续以激动的语调向观众介绍：白求恩同志刚把写好的信交给翻译，又昏迷了过去。当他慢慢苏醒过来后，他握住医生的手，断断续续地说：“请你转告聂司令员，建议他马上组织一支医疗队，接近火线，收容伤员。……战斗结束后，继续完成四分区的检查工作。”医生含着热泪告诉他，一切都有安排，请他安心休息。白求恩同志艰难地呼吸着。他再次抬起头来，向站在他身旁的中国同志，坚定地说出了最后一句话：
      “努力吧！向着伟大的路，开辟前面的事业！”
    一九三九年十一月十二日清晨，加拿大人民的优秀儿子、伟大的国际主义战士诺尔曼·白求恩同志，为了中国人民和世界人民的解放事业，献出了他宝贵的生命。
    观众们怀着沉重而敬仰的心情，瞻仰了白求恩同志的遗容照片，学习了伟大领袖毛主席给白求恩同志的题词：“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义。”喊着“向白求恩同志学习”“‘老三篇’万岁”的口号，重温了毛主席在延安各界追悼白求恩大会上写的挽词：“学习白求恩同志的国际精神，学习他的牺牲精神，责任心与工作热忱。”
    一九三九年十二月二十一日，毛主席写下了《纪念白求恩》这篇光辉著作。
    二十八年过去了。毛主席关于向白求恩同志学习的伟大号召，如阵阵春雷，震响着全中国和全世界，一代又一代的新人，在迅速成长起来。
    今天，人们前来参观“纪念白求恩展览”的时候，伟大的国际主义战士白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，伟大领袖毛主席在《纪念白求恩》中的教导，深深地激励着大家。他们把“纪念白求恩展览”，当作活学活用毛主席著作的好课堂。有些革命群众在参观中，以白求恩同志的“毫无自私自利之心”为标准，当场召开“斗私会”。前来参观的人们表示，一定要以白求恩同志为光辉榜样，以“老三篇”为思想武器，不断地斗私批修，改造世界观，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面彻底胜利。
    白求恩同志永远活在全中国和全世界革命人民的心里。他的伟大的共产主义精神，将如日月长新，永远鼓舞着人们为世界人民的革命事业奋勇前进。
