The people's war waged by the patriotic military and civilians of Laos against American imperialism and its lackeys has forged tens of thousands of outstanding soldiers. Thong Phin, a guerrilla fighter from the Firm Mountain region of Xieng Ngeun Province, is one of them. He bravely fought against the enemy, mobilized the masses to wage guerrilla warfare, and ultimately sacrificed his life for the liberation of the Lao people. His deeds embody the noble qualities of the heroic Lao soldiers.

Deep Hatred Fuels the Soldier's Spirit

The towering Firm Mountain is located in the Ban Na Firn region of Xieng Ngeun Province's Muan Sô County. Thong Phin was born and raised here. Orphaned at a young age, he went hunting with his uncle at the age of eleven. He traversed Firm Mountain, becoming familiar with every blade of grass and tree, quickly becoming a skilled hunter.

One day, the enemy suddenly invaded Thong Phin's hometown, forcibly conscripting soldiers and brutally killing patriotic compatriots. Witnessing this, Thong Phin's hatred for the enemy burned deeply.

To avenge his fellow villagers, Thong Phin joined the Lao People's Liberation Army. In the army, through political education, his class consciousness was heightened. He understood that only by persisting in armed struggle and eliminating the Americans and their lackeys could the Lao people find a way out. He tenaciously practiced his combat skills.

Soon, Thong Phin became a squad leader, leading his squad excellently and completing tasks and combat missions with distinction.

At the end of 1963, a battle erupted in the Ban Xieng region, marking Thong Phin's first combat experience. In this battle, he led eight soldiers to bravely and intelligently repel a "sweeping" operation by over fifty enemy soldiers. Later, he participated in numerous battles, eliminating batch after batch of enemies.

Mobilizing the Masses to Build an Iron Wall

In 1964, Thong Phin was given a new mission: to return to his hometown in the Firm Mountain region to organize a guerrilla force and wage guerrilla warfare. With a heart full of revolutionary fervor, he immediately integrated with the people upon his return, working tirelessly in propaganda, education, and organization. He mobilized the masses and quickly organized a guerrilla force, launching guerrilla warfare in his hometown.

The guerrilla force led by Thong Phin fought well and produced well, relying on and uniting with the masses. The people of the Firm Mountain region strongly supported and assisted them, working together to sharpen bamboo spikes and set traps to strike the enemy.

One day, the enemy launched a frenzied "sweeping" operation in Muan Sô County, attempting to extinguish the burgeoning guerrilla warfare there. Thong Phin discussed the counter-plan with everyone, making all necessary preparations. When the cowardly enemy cautiously advanced, Thong Phin calmly directed the guerrillas, raining bullets and grenades down on the enemy, making them pay a heavy price for every step forward. The guerrillas fought with exceptional bravery, intelligence, and flexibility. They exploited the enemy's fear of death and unfamiliarity with the terrain, striking them hard and eliminating a large number of enemies, achieving a glorious victory in the counter-sweeping operation.

Firm Mountain Endures, Evergreen Pine Stands Tall

One afternoon, Thong Phin and six guerrilla fighters were conducting grassroots organizational work in a remote village when they were suddenly surrounded by the enemy. The enemy howled outside, bluffing to boost their own morale. Facing the numerous enemies, Thong Phin calmly and decisively directed the guerrillas, repelling the enemy's repeated attacks. He fought bravely while conducting ideological mobilization, inspiring his comrades' fighting spirit. After eliminating a large number of enemies, Thong Phin decided to break through the enemy's weakest point. Relying on his intelligence, bravery, and familiarity with the terrain, he successfully led the guerrillas to break through the enemy's encirclement.

To intercept the enemy's advance and ensure the safe retreat of his comrades, Thong Phin resolutely stayed behind to provide cover. With one rifle, he used his years of honed marksmanship to take down several enemies. The enemy, seeing the small number of guerrillas, swarmed in. At this critical moment, Thong Phin was seriously injured, but he continued to fight tenaciously. He fired his last few bullets, knocking down three more enemies. When he saw that the other guerrillas had safely retreated, he closed his eyes with a smile.

Thong Phin sacrificed his life gloriously, but his radiant image will forever live in the hearts of the people of Firm Mountain and the Lao people. To commemorate Thong Phin's heroic deeds, the Lao Patriotic Front decided to posthumously award him the "Freedom" Medal.

The militia and guerrilla fighters in the liberated areas of Laos are brave and skilled, with high morale. In their battles against enemy attacks and the elimination of bandits, they have achieved continuous major victories.

　　坚山上的青松
　　记英勇的游击队员——通芬
    老挝爱国军民进行的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的人民战争，锻炼出了成千成万优秀的人民战士，桑怒省坚山地区的游击队员通芬就是其中的一个。他英勇杀敌，大力发动群众开展游击战争，为了老挝人民的解放事业，最后献出了自己的生命。他的事迹体现了英雄的老挝人民战士的崇高品质。
    深仇大恨激励战士斗志
    巍峨的坚山，位于桑怒省芒索县班纳坚地区。通芬就是在这里出生长大的。他自幼就是个孤儿，十一岁时跟着叔父一起去打猎了。他走遍了坚山，熟悉这里的一草一木，很快地就成了一个好猎手。
      一天，敌人突然闯进了通芬的家乡，强行抓丁和野蛮杀害爱国同胞。通芬眼看着这一切，激起了对敌人的深仇大恨。
    为了给乡亲们报仇，通芬参加了老挝人民解放军。在部队里，通过政治学习，他的阶级觉悟更加提高了。他懂得了只有坚持武装斗争，消灭美帝及其走狗，老挝人民才有出路。他顽强地练习杀敌本领。
    不久，通芬当了班长，他把自己的班带得很好，出色地完成工作和战斗任务。
    一九六三年底，班则地区的一场战斗打响了，这是通芬参加的第一次战斗。在这场战斗中，通芬带领八名战士勇敢机智地击溃了五十多个敌人发动的“扫荡”。以后他又参加了多次战斗，消灭了一批又一批的敌人。
    发动群众筑成铜墙铁壁
    一九六四年，通芬接受新的任务，回到家乡坚山地区组织游击队，开展游击战争。他怀着满腔的革命热情，一回到家乡，就同人民打成一片，废寝忘食地进行宣传、教育和组织工作，发动了群众，很快地组织起了游击队，把家乡的游击战争开展起来。
    通芬领导的这支游击队，战斗好，生产好，依靠群众，团结群众。坚山地区的人民大力支持和帮助他们，同他们一起削竹尖、设陷阱，打击敌人。
    一天，敌人对芒索县发动了疯狂的“扫荡”，企图扑灭这里蓬勃开展的游击战争。通芬同大家讨论了反“扫荡”的计划，作好了一切准备。当胆小如鼠的敌人一步步地摸索进来的时候，通芬沉着地指挥游击队，把复仇的子弹和手榴弹劈头盖脑地向敌人打去，使敌人每前进一步都要付出重大伤亡的代价。游击队打得异常勇猛、机智、灵活。他们抓住敌人怕死、人生地不熟的弱点，狠狠痛击，消灭了大批敌人，取得了反“扫荡”的辉煌胜利。
　　坚山常在  青松不倒
    一天下午，通芬同六个游击队员正在一个偏僻村庄里进行基层组织建设工作时，突然被敌人包围了。敌人在外面疯狂地嚎叫，虚张声势，为自己壮胆。面对着众多的敌人，通芬沉着果断地指挥着游击队员们，击退了敌人一次又一次的进攻。他一面英勇奋战，一面进行思想动员，鼓舞战友们的斗志。在消灭大量敌人后，通芬决定在敌人最薄弱的环节进行突围。凭着他的机智勇敢和对地形的熟悉，他终于带领游击队员胜利地突破了敌人的重围。
    为了截住敌人的进攻，让战友们安全撤退，通芬毅然留下掩护，他一人一杆枪，用多年来练就的一手好枪法打倒了好几个敌人。敌人发现游击队人少就一窝蜂地冲上来，就在这关键时刻，通芬受了重伤，但他仍顽强地坚持战斗，他射出最后几颗子弹，又把三个敌人打翻在地。当他回头看到其他游击队员已经安全撤退的时候，才微笑着闭上了眼睛。
    通芬光荣地牺牲了，但他光辉的形象却永远活在坚山人民和老挝人民的心中。为了表彰通芬的英雄事迹，老挝爱国战线党决定追赠他一枚“自由”勋章。　（据新华社）（附图片）
