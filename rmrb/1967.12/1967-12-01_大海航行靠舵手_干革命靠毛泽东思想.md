The sea voyage relies on the helmsperson, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought

The navy held a grand meeting to celebrate, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" a thousand times, ten thousand times. Heartfelt thanks to Vice Chairman Lin for his concern for the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high, to closely follow the great helmsperson Chairman Mao, and to advance steadfastly through the great waves of class struggle!

New China News Agency, December 30th: Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, on the 29th, inscribed for the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the navy: "The sea voyage relies on the helmsperson, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," greatly encouraging the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in the navy.

Today, representatives attending the navy's conference on active learners of Chairman Mao's works, leaders of the navy's leading organs, and cadres and soldiers of the navy's units stationed in Beijing, with hearts full of excitement, held a grand meeting to celebrate Vice Chairman Lin's inscription. The cadres and soldiers resolutely declared: We must respond to Vice Chairman Lin's call, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high, closely follow the great helmsperson Chairman Mao, and advance steadfastly through the great waves of class struggle, forever advancing!

On the evening of the 29th, after the good news of Vice Chairman Lin's inscription was announced, the leading organs of the navy and the units of the representatives attending the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works immediately became excited. The cadres and soldiers waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing "The sea voyage relies on the helmsperson" a thousand times, ten thousand times, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" "Heartfelt thanks to Vice Chairman Lin for his greatest concern!"

The leading organs of various general departments, various military branches, and the Beijing units, as well as the revolutionary masses of Beijing, upon hearing the good news, immediately sent representatives, braving the cold, to the navy's leading organ's station, to celebrate Vice Chairman Lin's inscription with the navy's cadres and soldiers. The more than 4,000 representatives attending the navy's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works held an all-night discussion. Many representatives wrote letters of resolve, guarantees, and letters of respect, expressing their resolve to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao. Many representatives sent telegrams and made phone calls overnight, spreading the good news to their comrades in their units. The navy's leading organ also used wireless facsimile to send Vice Chairman Lin's inscription to all subordinate units, quickly spreading Vice Chairman Lin's inscription throughout the ten thousand li of coastal defense.

This afternoon, representatives attending the navy's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works and cadres and soldiers of the navy's units stationed in Beijing, singing "The sea voyage relies on the helmsperson," marched into the venue with majestic steps. The venue was surrounded by red flags, and the giant red quotation board of Chairman Mao's words shone brightly in the sun. Above the stage hung the giant portrait of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsperson Chairman Mao, and below it was the giant plaque with Vice Chairman Lin's inscription. The cadres and soldiers, in the cold, were full of spirit and fighting spirit, loudly reading Chairman Mao's quotations: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." "We must struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism"; reading Vice Chairman Lin's inscription: "The sea voyage relies on the helmsperson, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

The navy's responsible comrades Xiao Jingguang, Li Zuopeng, Wang Hongkun, Zhang Xiuchuan, and others attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Zhang Xiuchuan. Wang Hongkun, amidst thunderous applause, read Vice Chairman Lin's inscription to the meeting and then presented the plaque with Vice Chairman Lin's inscription to the representatives of various units and representative teams. At this moment, the venue shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years! To salute Vice Chairman Lin!"

Li Zuopeng first spoke at the meeting. He said, Vice Chairman Lin's inscription for the navy's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works is a great joyous event in the political life of the navy, and it is also a great joyous event in the political life of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country. This is the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest spur for all cadres and soldiers in the navy by the great helmsperson Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin.

He pointed out that the sixteen characters inscribed by Vice Chairman Lin, "The sea voyage relies on the helmsperson, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," are the eternal direction of our army's construction. Under the loving care of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, we, the entire navy's cadres and soldiers, have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, insisted on the Four Firsts, carried forward the Three-Eight Style, promoted the Three Great Democracies, launched the Four Good Units movement, and fought resolutely against the bourgeois military line promoted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, defending and implementing Chairman Mao's brilliant military thoughts, achieving one victory after another. All these achievements are due to the great helmsperson Chairman Mao and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought.

Li Zuopeng emphasized in his speech that we must seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely implement Vice Chairman Lin's inscription. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, explode a revolution in the depths of our souls, launch an offensive against "selfishness," and thoroughly transform our worldview. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, better complete the tasks of "supporting the left," "military control," and "military training," and thoroughly implement the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and build the navy into a solid sea wall.

An active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a famous combat hero, Mai Xiande, spoke at the meeting with boundless affection for Chairman Mao. He said, Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, "The sea voyage relies on the helmsperson, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," expresses our innermost feelings. I have read it a thousand times and still want to read it, sung it ten thousand times and still want to sing it. I want to tell my comrades, sing to the people of the whole country, I want to shout to the people of the whole world: Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. The sea voyage relies on the helmsperson, and the helmsperson is the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao steers for the Chinese revolution, steers for the world revolution. Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the Chinese revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of the world revolution also relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

Representatives attending the navy's conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works unanimously pointed out in their speeches that Vice Chairman Lin's inscription most concentratedly and fully expresses the deep feelings of revolutionary soldiers' boundless love, boundless faith, boundless admiration, and boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is a mobilization order, guiding us to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage; Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is a call to arms, calling on us to work with the people of the whole country to turn the whole country into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

The meeting read the resolution of the entire navy's cadres and soldiers to Vice Chairman Lin, the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, expressing their determination to take Vice Chairman Lin as their example, to place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything, to forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

Today, attending the meeting with the navy's cadres and soldiers to celebrate Vice Chairman Lin's inscription were responsible comrades from the various general departments, various military branches, various military academies, and the Beijing units of the People's Liberation Army, Zhang Chiming, Yu Lizhen, Chen Xianrui, Lu Yang, Chen Shigui, Chen Renqi, Wu Lie, Huang Zhiyong, Jiang Wen, Li Zhen, Liu Fu, Liu Zhong, Song Weiqin, and others.
