The method of thematic criticism is good. In Hubei Province, Luotian County, Wengjiawan Commune, First Brigade, using the thought of Chairman Mao Zedong as a weapon, closely combining it with the actual situation of the brigade, they systematically criticize the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. This is a good method for deepening the revolutionary criticism in rural areas.

Thematic criticism means, within a certain period, concentrating on studying one aspect of the brilliant statements of the great leader Chairman Mao, criticizing one aspect of the reactionary points of the Chinese Khrushchev, and eliminating the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev in this aspect. This method is advocated by Comrade Lin Biao: study with questions in mind, learn actively and apply actively, combine learning with application, learn what is urgently needed first, and achieve immediate results by focusing on application.

In this way, the extensive study of Chairman Mao's works is closely combined with the extensive criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev. Through the study of one problem after another and the criticism of one theme after another, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants can concretely distinguish between the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev; they can further arouse their class feelings of boundless love for Chairman Mao, more firmly follow Chairman Mao in walking the socialist road; they can further hate the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside, and more actively participate in the revolutionary criticism. In this way, they will more consciously take "criticizing the self and criticizing revisionism" as the key, and in the depths of their souls, ignite a revolutionary explosion to criticize the self and establish the public, thoroughly reform their world outlook, and strive to build a new socialist countryside.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are direct participants in the struggle between the two lines in the countryside. Their village history, family history, commune history, and brigade history are all living textbooks for this struggle. As long as the great thought of Mao Zedong is used to analyze these living textbooks, they can elevate their practical experience to the height of the struggle between the two lines, and deeply realize that "there is no other way except socialism." They will thoroughly eliminate all revisionist poison and turn the countryside into a school where the thought of Mao Zedong is flourishing.

### 专题批判办法好

    专题批判办法好
    湖北省罗田县翁家垸公社一大队，以毛泽东思想为武器，紧密结合本队的实际，对中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线，有计划地进行专题批判。这是农村深入开展革命大批判的一个好办法。
    专题批判，就是在一段时间内，集中学习伟大领袖毛主席一个方面的英明论述，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个方面的反动论点，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在这方面的流毒。这种方法，就是林彪同志提倡的，带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫。
    这样，就把毛主席著作的大学习同对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判紧密地结合起来了。广大贫下中农，通过一个一个问题的学习，一个一个专题的批判，就能够具体地划清毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的界限；就更加激发起对毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，更加坚定地紧跟毛主席走社会主义道路；就更加痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，更加积极地投入革命的大批判。这样，他们就会更自觉地以“斗私，批修”为纲，在灵魂深处爆发破私立公的革命，彻底改造自己的世界观，为建设社会主义的新农村而奋斗到底。
    广大贫农下中农是农村两条道路斗争的直接参加者。他们的村史、家史、社史、队史，就是这场斗争的活教材。只要用伟大的毛泽东思想，来分析这些活教材，他们就能把自己的实践经验，提高到两条路线斗争的高度来认识，就会深刻地体会到：“除了社会主义，再无别的出路”，彻底肃清一切修正主义流毒，把农村办成旗帜鲜红的毛泽东思想大学校。
