In the great era of Mao Zedong Thought, our great motherland is resounding with songs of victory, and heroes are emerging in droves.

Comrade Li Wenzhong is a shining example who emerged during this great period of human history's transformation. He is a shining model of someone who, in the struggle between the two lines, actively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, and is ever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. He is a beacon of supporting the army and loving the people. With hearts full of boundless respect, we have studied and restudied the deeds of the heroic martyr Li Wenzhong; our excited hearts have taken a long time to calm down. The hero's actions stem from the great Mao Zedong Thought. Only by following Chairman Mao's instructions in every detail can we ensure our loyalty to Chairman Mao in critical moments.

Being ever loyal to Chairman Mao, ever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and ever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most fundamental standard for us to change our worldview. It is also the most fundamental stance, the most fundamental awareness, and the most precious quality of revolutionary soldiers. In the fierce and complex struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Li Wenzhong stood firmly and clearly. Comrade Li Wenzhong's deed of rushing to save the Red Guards is a concentrated expression of his loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. His heroic deeds will forever be recorded in the annals of revolution; his heroic image will forever be etched in our hearts; his communist spirit will forever inspire us to move forward.

The heroic soldiers of the Fourth Platoon who participated in the rescue of the Red Guards and revolutionary masses, and the female community member saved by the martyr Li Wenzhong, held a meeting by the Gan River. They resolved to hold high the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" and strive to be models of supporting the army and loving the people.

    无限忠于毛主席
    空军七一九四部队政治处
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代，我们伟大的祖国，凯歌四起，英雄辈出。
    李文忠同志是在人类历史伟大变革时期涌现出来的光辉典型，是在两条路线斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的光辉榜样，是拥军爱民的一面光辉旗帜。我们怀着无限崇敬的心情，一遍又一遍地学习了英雄李文忠烈士的事迹；我们激动的心久久不能平静。英雄的行为，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。只有平时一点一滴地照毛主席的指示办事，才能在紧要关头保证无限忠于毛主席。
    无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是我们改造世界观的最根本标准，也是我们革命战士最根本的立场，最根本的觉悟，最宝贵的品质。在无产阶级文化大革命尖锐复杂的斗争中，李文忠同志旗帜鲜明，立场坚定。李文忠同志奋身抢救红卫兵小将的事迹，就是他无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的集中表现。他的英雄事迹，将永远载入革命史册；他的英雄形象，将永远留在我们的心中；他的共产主义精神，将永远激励我们前进。（附图片）
