The propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Huainan City, Anhui Province, helped the revolutionary masses of Xie'er Coal Mine to hold a class studying Mao Zedong Thought. They organized the students to seriously study Chairman Mao's instructions, taking "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, combining theory with practice, carrying out self-criticism, eliminating estrangement, enhancing unity, and consolidating the great revolutionary alliance from the political and ideological aspects.

After the revolutionary mass organizations of Xie'er Coal Mine achieved great revolutionary unity, some comrades still had factionalism. They always thought that everything about themselves was good and everything about others was bad. Therefore, they often quarreled over trivial matters and tried to suppress each other. This situation seriously affected the consolidation of the great unity.

In the study class, everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the great revolutionary alliance and on "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity," and unanimously recognized that only by carrying out more self-criticism can one comprehensively view comrades and correctly recognize oneself; only in this way can one overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism and enhance proletarian party spirit; only in this way can one consolidate the great revolutionary alliance. A leader of a revolutionary mass organization said: Chairman Mao teaches us that criticizing one's own shortcomings is like washing one's face and sweeping the floor every day. To solve the problems of disputes among comrades, one can only use the "broom" to sweep oneself first and cannot use fists to hurt comrades. Using fists to hurt comrades will only deepen the estrangement, making the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party happy, and moving further away from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I will definitely put down my fists and pick up the "broom" to first sweep away the dirt in the depths of my soul.

The study class carried out the activity of "finding each other's strengths and finding one's own weaknesses." Everyone said: If one does not find, one does not understand; if one finds, one is shocked. The more one finds, the more one feels that the other person is lovable, the deeper the class feelings, and the more common language there is; the more one finds, the more one feels that one has many problems, and the more one feels that not listening to Chairman Mao's words is terrible. A leader of a revolutionary mass organization originally thought that only he and his organization were the most revolutionary, and other organizations and comrades were "fake revolutionaries" and "true conservatives." Through the "two-find" activity, he not only saw many strengths of the brother organizations and comrades but also recognized many weaknesses of himself and his organization. In the end, he voluntarily handled the materials he had prepared to criticize the other side and sincerely carried out self-criticism.

Due to the mischief of the "self," some comrades did not dare to carry out serious self-criticism, fearing that others would grab their "ponytails" and fearing that their prestige would be affected. The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team further studied the brilliant "Five Articles" with everyone and inspired everyone to list the crimes of the "self" and discuss the harm of the "self." With the improvement of ideological understanding, a mass self-criticism movement quickly arose. Everyone said: "Dare to divide oneself into two or not, dare to carry out self-criticism or not, is the touchstone to test whether one is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary, and it is also the yardstick to test whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." Some comrades, with their selfish thoughts overcome, brought out the dirt hidden deep in their souls for a long time, sincerely asking comrades to help them, and resolutely decided to correct themselves.

The revolutionary masses of Xie'er Coal Mine actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's instructions, combined theory with practice, and quickly launched a new high tide of criticizing and repudiating revisionism, further consolidating the great revolutionary alliance. Everyone said with deep feelings: In the past, the reason why we were deceived by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and fought internal wars was that we did not actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. In the future, we will guarantee to double our efforts to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly transform our worldview, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    拿起自我批评的武器　铲掉灵魂深处的垃圾
    淮南谢二煤矿革命派认真斗私批修巩固了革命大联合
    本报讯　安徽省淮南市驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助谢二煤矿无产阶级革命派举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织学员认真学习毛主席的指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，理论联系实际，开展自我批评，消除了隔阂，增强了团结，从政治思想上巩固了革命的大联合。
    谢二煤矿各革命群众组织实现了革命大联合以后，有些同志仍然带有派性。他们总认为自己一切都好，别人一切都坏，因此常常因为一些枝节问题，争执不休，想把对方压下去。这种情况严重地影响了大联合的巩固。
    在学习班里，大家反复学习了毛主席关于革命大联合、关于“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”等指示，一致认识到：只有多做自我批评，才能全面看待同志，正确认识自己；才能克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性；才能巩固革命的大联合。一位革命群众组织负责人说：毛主席教导我们，批评自己的缺点，好象天天要洗脸，天天要扫地一样。解决同志之间的争论问题，只能用“扫帚”首先扫自己，不能用拳头伤同志。用拳头伤同志，越伤隔阂越深，党内一小撮走资派越高兴，离毛主席的革命路线越远。我一定收回拳头，拿起“扫帚”，首先把自己灵魂深处的脏东西扫得干干净净。
    学习班里开展了“互找优点，自找缺点”的活动。大家说：不找不开窍，一找吓一跳。越找越觉得对方可爱，越找阶级感情越深，共同语言越多；越找越觉得自己问题不少，越找越感到不听毛主席的话不得了。一位革命群众组织负责人，原先总认为自己和自己的组织才是最革命的，其他组织和同志都是“假革命”“真保守”。通过“两找”活动，他不仅看到了兄弟组织和同志的许多长处，而且也认识到了自己和自己组织的不少缺点，最后，他主动地处理了准备整对方的材料，诚恳地作了自我批评。
    由于“私”字作怪，有些同志不敢做认真的自我批评，怕别人抓辫子，怕影响威信。毛泽东思想宣传队的同志又和大家一起进一步学习光辉的“老五篇”，并启发大家大列“私”字的罪状，大谈“私”字的危害。随着思想认识的提高，很快掀起了一个群众性的自我批评的热潮。大家说：“敢不敢对自己一分为二，能不能开展自我批评，是衡量真革命假革命的试金石，也是检验是否忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的金尺子。”有的同志随着私心杂念被克服，把长期以来隐藏在灵魂深处的脏东西端了出来，诚恳地请求同志们帮助自己，下决心坚决改正。
    谢二煤矿的革命派活学活用毛主席的指示，理论联系实际，迅速地掀起了斗私批修的新高潮，进一步巩固了革命大联合。大家十分感慨地说：过去我们之所以上了党内一小撮走资派的当，互相打内战，就是因为没有活学活用毛主席著作。今后，我们保证加十倍的劲来活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，彻底改造自己的世界观，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
