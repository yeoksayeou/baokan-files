He strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for using the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnamese issue. He pointed out that the Vietnamese people's ironclad resolve to carry the anti-U.S. struggle for national liberation to the end is unshakable by any violence or deception. The brave Vietnamese people firmly grasp their guns to fight and will thoroughly annihilate the U.S. aggressors.

Nguyen Van Hieu, Head of the Delegation, held this press conference to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

He said, the more the U.S. imperialists hurl their peace schemes, the more their warlike and aggressive nature is exposed. The only correct way to solve the Vietnamese problem is through the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He pointed out that the U.S. aggressors are in a desperate situation on the Vietnamese battlefield, and the South Vietnamese people, who are determined to fight, will definitely win the final victory.

At the press conference, Nguyen Van Hieu, Head of the Delegation, detailed the glorious victories achieved by the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in leading the South Vietnamese people to bravely fight against the U.S. aggressors over the past seven years. He said, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with its powerful political and military strength, has become the master of the situation in South Vietnam. It represents the will and aspirations of the broad masses of the South Vietnamese people.

Nguyen Van Hieu, in his speech, once again expressed his gratitude to the revered Chairman Mao and the Chinese people for their tremendous aid to the South Vietnamese people.
