New Delhi, December 17 (Xinhua) — Some leaders of the Indian reactionary government, fearing the intense resistance of the Indian people, have recently been forced to cancel some of their plans to travel to other provinces and are staying in the capital, afraid to go out.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had originally planned to go to Uttar Pradesh on the 17th to preside over the opening ceremony of a floating bridge on the Ganges. Uttar Pradesh is her hometown, and the bridge is in her election constituency. The governor and chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, fearing that Indira Gandhi's arrival would provoke even stronger resistance from the local people, advised her to stay in New Delhi on the grounds of "lack of security" and not to go to Uttar Pradesh.

Indian Deputy Prime Minister Desai also canceled his plan to visit Gorakhpur University in Uttar Pradesh for similar reasons.

Another Indian official who is afraid to go out is Home Minister Chavan. He had planned to visit his hometown of Maharashtra. Recently, due to the growing struggle of the people in that province against the Indian reactionary government, Chavan also expressed that he is "not in a hurry" to visit Maharashtra.

The ruling party of India, the Indian National Congress, had originally planned to hold its annual meeting in Sangli, Maharashtra. Due to the fear of strong anti-Congress demonstrations by the people, this meeting has been forced to be postponed.

The Indian reactionaries, acting as lackeys of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, have committed various acts of selling out the interests of the Indian people, causing widespread resentment across the country. The Indian people's struggle against tyranny is rising and falling. In this situation, the days of the Indian reactionaries are getting worse and worse.

　　印度人民反对暴政斗争此伏彼起
　　反动头目怕得要死惶惶不可终日
    新华社十七日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府的一些头目，由于害怕印度人民的激烈反抗，最近被迫取消了一些到外省去活动的计划，呆在首都不敢外出。
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地原订十七日到北方邦去主持一道在恒河上的浮桥的落成典礼。北方邦是她的家乡，那道桥就在她竞选议员的选区内。北方邦的邦长和首席部长生怕英迪拉·甘地的到来会激起当地人民更加强烈的反抗，因此，就以所谓“安全没有保障”为名，劝她呆在新德里，不要到北方邦去。
    印度副总理德赛也由于类似的原因，打消了到北方邦果腊克普尔大学去活动的计划。
    另一个不敢外出的印度大官僚是内政部长恰范，他本来打算到他的家乡马哈拉施特拉邦去活动。最近由于这个邦内的人民反对印度反动政府的斗争同样日益发展，恰范也表示“不急于”访问马哈拉施特拉邦。
    印度执政党国大党原订最近在马哈拉施特拉邦桑格利地方召开年会。由于害怕人民举行强烈的反国大党示威，这次年会已经被迫延期举行。
    印度反动派充当美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的走卒，干下了各种出卖印度人民利益的勾当，弄得全国各地民怨沸腾，印度人民反抗暴政的斗争此伏彼起。在这种形势下，印度反动派的日子是愈来愈不好过。
