The seas are in turmoil, the clouds are angry, and the winds of revolution are stirring across the five continents. Amidst the great situation of surging revolutionary waves worldwide, and as the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation achieves one victory after another, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued a telegram to Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, to celebrate the seventh anniversary of its founding! The news has brought immense joy to the revolutionary teachers and students of our academy.

Every word and sentence in Chairman Mao's telegram is a great truth, shining like a beacon, illuminating the path to victory for all oppressed nations and peoples in their struggles for liberation. It is the greatest support and encouragement for the Vietnamese people and revolutionary people all over the world, with immense contemporary significance and profound historical implications. Chairman Mao's telegram fully expresses the resolve of 700 million Chinese people to firmly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call and, together with the people of the entire nation and the fraternal Vietnamese people, and with revolutionary people all over the world, fight to the end to thoroughly defeat American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionaries in all countries!

Under the wise leadership of Comrade Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people, facing the most ferocious enemy of the people worldwide, American imperialism, are fearless. With the revolutionary spirit of "only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards," they employ the strategies and tactics of people's war, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, dare to struggle, and dare to win. They have fought the American aggressors to the point of desperation and utter defeat. This further proves Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion that "American imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." Their heroic deeds of struggle have composed a magnificent song of people's war that shakes the world, setting a brilliant example for all revolutionary people worldwide in resisting American aggression and achieving complete liberation.

Chairman Mao said: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." To save their doomed fate, American imperialism alternately uses military adventurism and political deception, attempting to conquer the Vietnamese people. The chief accomplice of the American imperialists—the Soviet revisionist leadership—also colludes with the Americans, eagerly peddling the "peace talks" poison, dreaming of extinguishing the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation. However, contrary to their reactionary wishes, neither military threats nor sweet-talking deception can make the heroic Vietnamese people yield. The Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation will surely achieve final victory, and the evil plots of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism will surely meet with thorough failure.

In the telegram, Chairman Mao fully expresses our ironclad pledge: "The 700 million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people." Today, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao in our country, has achieved decisive victory. Our great motherland has become even stronger and more consolidated. Thus, we will be able to more powerfully support the fraternal Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation and more powerfully support the struggles of revolutionary people all over the world, driving the American aggressors out of Vietnam and out of all the places they occupy!

The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute have been closely following the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national liberation. Every victory achieved by the Vietnamese people brings us immense joy and inspires us to bravely advance along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of the proletarian educational revolution, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our school, turn our school into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought, and temper ourselves into reliable successors who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary cause. Once needed, as soon as Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately rush to the front lines, fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people, thoroughly defeat the American aggressors, and contribute all our efforts to the final victory of the world revolution.

    胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民
    北京邮电学院革命委员会
    四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。在世界革命浪潮风起云涌的大好形势下，在越南人民抗美救国战争取得一个又一个辉煌胜利的时候，我们的伟大领袖毛主席为祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年致阮友寿主席的贺电发表了！喜讯传来，我院革命师生感到无比振奋。
    毛主席的贺电，每一字、每一句都是伟大的真理，象一座光辉灿烂的灯塔，照亮了全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民进行斗争、争取解放的胜利道路，是对越南人民和全世界革命人民的最大支持、最大鼓舞，具有极其伟大的现实意义和无比深远的历史意义。毛主席的贺电，最充分地表达了七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的决心，我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，和全国人民一起，和兄弟的越南人民一起，和全世界革命人民一起，为彻底打倒美帝、苏修和各国反动派而斗争到底！
    越南人民在伟大领袖胡志明主席的英明领导下，面对着全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，毫不畏惧，以“独有英雄驱虎豹”的革命精神，运用人民战争的战略战术，动员群众，依靠群众，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，把美国侵略者打得走投无路，狼狈不堪。这就更进一步证明了毛主席指出的“美帝国主义和各国反动派都是纸老虎”的光辉论断。他们英勇的斗争业绩，谱成了震撼全球的人民战争的壮丽凯歌，为全世界革命人民树立了抗击美帝侵略、争取彻底解放的光辉榜样。
    毛主席说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美帝国主义为了挽救它们行将灭亡的命运，交替使用军事冒险和政治欺骗的反革命两手，妄图征服越南人民。美帝的头号帮凶——苏修领导集团，也和美帝勾勾搭搭，卖力地兜售“和谈”的黑货，梦想扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火。但是，和他们这种反动的主观愿望相反，无论什么武力的恐吓和“好话”的欺骗，都不能使英雄的越南人民屈服。越南人民的抗美救国斗争一定能够取得最后的胜利，美帝和苏修的罪恶阴谋必将遭到彻底的失败。
    毛主席在贺电里最充分地表达了我们的钢铁誓言：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”今天，由毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。我们伟大的祖国更加坚强巩固了。这样，我们就将更有力地支援兄弟的越南人民的抗美救国斗争，更有力地支援世界革命人民的斗争，把美国侵略者从越南、从它所霸占的一切地方统统赶出去！
    我们北京邮电学院的革命师生，一直密切注视着越南人民的抗美救国斗争，越南人民取得的每一个胜利都使我们感到欢欣鼓舞，激励着我们勇敢地沿着毛主席指引的方向前进。我们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起无产阶级教育革命的新高潮，搞好本校的斗、批、改，把我们的学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，把自己锻炼成为永远无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。一旦需要，只要毛主席一声令下，我们就立即奔赴前线，和越南人民并肩作战，彻底打败美国侵略者，为世界革命事业的最后胜利贡献我们的一切。
