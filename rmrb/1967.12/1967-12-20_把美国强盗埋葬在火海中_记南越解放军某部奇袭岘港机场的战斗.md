The sky gradually darkened, and the soldiers of a certain artillery unit of the Liberation Army, carrying heavy weapons and ammunition on their shoulders, hurried towards Da Nang Airport.

The moonlight illuminated the path ahead.

In front of the soldiers, the lights of Da Nang Airport were already in sight. Thousands of American bandits were stationed there, and there were piles of murderous weapons and ammunition. The sky above the airport was filled with reconnaissance planes constantly flying and searching for targets. Occasionally, one or two flares would appear in the sky. The enemy's rapid-fire cannons nearby were blindly shelling the surrounding areas.

Every two or three minutes, a batch of planes would take off or land at Da Nang Airport, and the number of planes parked on the airport increased.

The soldiers stopped near a village. The scouts reported to the commanding officer for the last time. At this moment, the villagers all came to the front lines to comfort the Liberation Army artillery soldiers and the young assault team members. Some elderly women and sisters stuffed packages of steaming hot food into the soldiers' hands.

Before the battle began, the guerrilla fighters who were coordinating with the troops had all arrived. On the front lines, the Liberation Army quickly pushed the cannons to their positions. The moon had disappeared. In the pitch-black night, the Liberation Army soldiers, guerrilla fighters, assault team members, and villagers were all busy preparing to light the torch that would set Da Nang Airport ablaze.

The soldiers walked along the edge of the fields, being very careful and cautious, afraid of trampling the crops. Seeing this, several elderly women became anxious and said, "Children, don't be stingy with these few grains of rice. Just go ahead and annihilate the enemy. Once we have eliminated all the American aggressors, we will rebuild our homes to be even more beautiful." The crowd and the guerrilla fighters all helped the Liberation Army artillery soldiers clean their weapons and deliver ammunition.

In an instant, the Liberation Army's various types of artillery were all loaded and aimed at Da Nang Airport. The commanders at all levels conducted the final checks for battle preparations. Everything was ready, and the artillery soldiers were watching the direction of the airport, their hands on the trigger cords.

At 2:30 AM, the commanding officer ordered the attack:

"For the independence and freedom of our country, fire!"

"Annihilate the American bandits and avenge the people of both the North and the South. Fire!"

The Liberation Army's artillery rained down on Da Nang Airport, turning it into a sea of fire that buried the American bandits.

A huge column of fire and smoke rose into the sky, and the enemy's fuel depot was on fire. The sound of explosions echoed endlessly, and the enemy's ammunition depot exploded, with ten million rocket shells all exploding. The land trembled violently, and the aggressors' feet were blown off the ground.

The lights in Da Nang went out, and the sound of alarms rang out. The enemy's airport was engulfed in flames. American planes were blown to pieces. The enemy's parking lot was also on fire. The Liberation Army's cannons continued to bombard, with the shells accurately hitting all the predetermined targets. The American pilots' barracks were hit. The bandits were blown to pieces. These American air pirates, who had committed countless crimes against the Vietnamese people, received severe punishment.

The enemy outposts around the airport dared not make a sound, and there was a deathly silence. They were all worried about their own fate.

The sound of explosions at the airport spread in all directions. The fire that burned Da Nang Airport continued to burn until 6 PM before it was extinguished.

In this battle, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated more than four hundred American aggressors; destroyed eighty-seven enemy planes; destroyed two hundred military vehicles; burned one million gallons of gasoline; and destroyed thousands of bombs and ten million rocket shells.

Da Nang Airport suffered a severe blow. The American bandits had to stop airport activities for a week. Some American officers in Da Nang City were so frightened by the Liberation Army's surprise attack that they fled to the Tea Mountain Peninsula in a panic.

The victory of the Liberation Army's surprise attack made the people of Da Nang rejoice and praise it. They said excitedly, "Even if the Americans run to the Tea Mountain, they cannot escape the punishment of the Liberation Army. For them, there is not a single inch of safe land in the South."

　　把美国强盗埋葬在火海中
　　——记南越解放军某部奇袭岘港机场的战斗
    天色逐渐暗下来，解放军某炮兵部队的战士肩上扛着沉甸甸的武器、弹药，朝着岘港机场的方向快步前进。
    月光照亮了前进的道路。
    在战士的前面，岘港机场的灯光已经在望了。这里驻有几千名美国强盗，堆放着许多杀人的武器和弹药。机场附近的上空，侦察机不停地飞着，到处搜索目标。天空中不时出现一、两颗照明弹。机场附近的敌军快速大炮盲目地轰击着邻近地区。
    岘港机场每隔两、三分钟便有一批飞机起飞或者降落，机场上停放的飞机越来越多。
    战士们在一个村庄附近停下来。侦察员们向部队指挥员作最后的一次报告。这时村庄里的老乡都自动来到阵地，慰问解放军炮兵战士和青年突击队员。一些老大娘、大嫂把一包包热气腾腾的食物塞进战士们手里。
    战斗开始之前，配合部队作战的游击战士都到齐了。阵地上，解放军迅速把大炮推到各个炮位上。月亮已经隐没了。在漆黑的夜里，解放军战士、游击队员、突击队员和老乡们正在紧张准备点燃焚烧岘港机场的火炬。
    战士们走在田边，都很谨慎、小心，深怕糟塌了庄稼。几位老大娘见了都替他们焦急，说：“孩子们，你们不要吝惜这几粒谷，只管前去消灭敌人好了。等把美国侵略者都消灭光了，我们将把家园重建得更加美丽。”在场的群众和游击队战士一起都帮助解放军炮兵战士擦武器、送炮弹。
    顷刻间，解放军各种不同口径的枪炮的炮弹都上了膛，炮口对准了岘港机场。各级指挥员作最后一次的战斗准备工作的检查。一切准备就绪，炮兵战士注视着机场的方向，手里拉着扣动板机的绳子。
    二时三十分，指挥员下令开火：
    “为了祖国的独立、自由，打！”
    “消灭美国强盗，为南北两方人民报仇。打！”
    解放军的炮弹倾泻到岘港机场，把它变成埋葬美国强盗的一片火海。
    一条巨大的火烟升上高空，敌人的汽油库燃烧了。轰隆、轰隆的爆炸声响个不停，敌人的弹药库爆炸了，十万枚火箭炮弹都爆炸了。土地剧烈地震动，侵略者脚下的土地被炸开了。
    岘港内的电灯熄灭了，响起了一阵阵警报声。敌人的机场淹没在火海之中。美国飞机被炸得粉碎。敌人停车场也在燃烧。解放军的大炮还在不断地轰击，炮弹都准确地落到各个预定的目标。美国飞行员的营房被击中了。强盗们被炸得血肉横飞。这些欠下越南人民累累血债的美国飞贼遭到了严重的惩罚。
    机场四周的敌军据点都不敢吭声，死一般的沉静。他们都在担心着自己的命运。
    机场的炸弹爆炸声传到四方。焚烧岘港机场的大火一直燃烧到下午六时才熄灭。
    这次战斗，解放武装力量消灭了四百多个美国侵略者；击毁八十七架敌机；击毁二百辆军车；烧毁一百万升汽油；使成千颗炸弹和十万枚火箭烧毁爆炸。
    岘港机场遭到了严重的打击。美国强盗不得不在一个星期内停止机场的活动。在岘港市内的美国侵略军的一些军官被解放军的这一奇袭吓得魂飞魄散，慌忙逃避到茶山半岛去。
    解放军这次奇袭的胜利，使岘港人民人人称快、叫好，他们兴高采烈地说：“美国佬跑到茶山也不能逃脱解放军的惩罚，对他们来说，在南方没有一寸土地是安全的。”（附图片）
