Chairman Ho Chi Minh calls for unity and victory in the anti-American national salvation war

New China News Agency, Hanoi, December 25th - The great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, recently delivered an important speech at a grand gathering in Hanoi to commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army and the 21st anniversary of the nationwide resistance war. Chairman Ho pointed out: "The nature of American imperialism is unchanging until death, and it has not abandoned its aggressive plots. Therefore, all our military and civilian personnel must be more closely united, always vigilant, advance with the momentum of victory, and resolutely smash all its plots. The 31 million compatriots in the north and south, regardless of gender and age, must become 31 million brave warriors to annihilate the Americans and save the nation, and resolutely achieve the final victory."

This gathering was jointly organized by the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the Ministry of National Defense of Vietnam, and the Hanoi Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh, along with other Vietnamese party and government leaders such as Ton Duc Thang, Le Duan, Vo Nguyen Giap, and Pham Van Dong, as well as Nguyen Van Thieu, the acting head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in North Vietnam, and leaders of various parties and mass organizations in Vietnam, attended the meeting.

In the midst of warm applause, Chairman Ho Chi Minh delivered his speech. Chairman Ho said: "Twenty-three years ago, I and some comrades were given a glorious task by our party: to organize, train, and lead our country's people's army. At the beginning, there were only a few small groups of guerrillas and primitive weapons. Due to the party's Marxist-Leninist line and the enthusiastic support of our compatriots, our army quickly grew and made important contributions to seizing power in the August Revolution. After nearly nine years of war, we finally defeated the colonialist professional army in the resounding battle of Dien Bien Phu. Today, our army has added another brother, that is, the heroic armed forces under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. This armed force is now defeating 120,000 American invaders and their puppet armies."

Chairman Ho said that in our nationwide people's war against American imperialism, many heroes and warriors have emerged. Their heroic deeds should be praised and we should feel proud.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out in his speech that the Vietnamese people are united as one, the Vietnamese army is invincible, and with the help and support of the people of the world, Vietnam will win, and the United States will lose.

Chairman Ho said: "However, the nature of American imperialism is unchanging until death, and it has not abandoned its aggressive plots. Therefore, all our military and civilian personnel must be more closely united, always vigilant, advance with the momentum of victory, and resolutely smash all its plots. The 31 million compatriots in the north and south, regardless of gender and age, must become 31 million brave warriors to annihilate the Americans and save the nation, and resolutely achieve the final victory."

In conclusion, Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on the Vietnamese military and civilian personnel to "bravely endure hardships and sacrifices, resolutely fight against American aggression to save the nation, achieve more great victories, and thus complete the great task of defending the north, liberating the south, and reunifying the country."

After Chairman Ho's speech, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly.

General Van Tien Dung, Chief of the General Staff of the Vietnamese People's Army, then spoke at the meeting. He said: "We will follow Chairman Ho's teachings: 'The 17 million northern compatriots are determined to keep their promise, fight side by side with the 14 million southern compatriots, to liberate the south, defend the north, and ultimately reunify the country.'"

He pointed out that the American aggressors are suffering heavy defeats in both North and South Vietnam, but they are still plotting to expand the war of aggression. The more American imperialism sinks into the quagmire of aggression, the more it will suffer heavy defeats.

General Van Tien Dung concluded: "Our nation is a heroic nation, we have an invincible army, fighting a people's war, we will definitely achieve the final victory in the struggle to defend the north, liberate the south, and reunify the country."

The meeting finally adopted a resolution, calling on all Vietnamese military and civilian personnel to resolutely implement Chairman Ho's sacred call to fight against American aggression to save the nation, with the spirit of 'everything for the victory over the American aggressors,' strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, fight well, work well, fear no hardships and sacrifices, smash all American aggressors' war 'escalations,' and determine to lead the anti-American national salvation cause to complete victory.

The acting head of the Chinese embassy in Vietnam and diplomats from various countries were also invited to attend this gathering.

    胡志明主席向越南军民发出战斗号召  紧密团结夺取抗美救国战争最后胜利
    新华社河内二十五日电　越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席最近在河内举行的纪念越南人民军建军二十三周年和全国抗战二十一周年的隆重集会上发表了重要讲话。胡主席指出：“美帝国主义的本性是至死不变的，它没有放弃侵略阴谋。因此，我们全国军民必须更加紧密团结，时刻提高警惕，乘胜前进，坚决粉碎它的一切阴谋。我国南北两方三千一百万同胞，不管男女老少，要成为三千一百万歼美救国的英勇战士，坚决夺取最后胜利。”
    这次集会是由越南祖国战线中央委员会、越南国防部和越南祖国战线河内市委员会联合举办的。
    胡志明主席以及孙德胜、黎笋、长征、范文同等越南党政领导人，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团代理团长阮富帅，以及越南各党派各群众团体的负责人出席了大会。
    胡志明主席在热烈的掌声中发表讲话。胡主席说：“二十三年前，我和一些同志得到我们党交给的一项光荣任务，即：组织、训练和领导我国的人民军队。开头，只有几小批游击队和简陋的武器。由于有党的马克思列宁主义路线和同胞的踊跃支持，我们的军队迅速地成长起来，为在八月革命夺取政权作出了重要的贡献，并经过近九年的抗战之后，在轰轰烈烈的奠边府战斗中最终打败了殖民主义的职业军队。今天，我们军队又增添了一个亲兄弟，那就是在越南南方民族解放阵线英明领导下的英雄的武装力量。这支武装力量正在战胜一百二十万美国侵略军及其走狗军队。”
    胡主席说，在我们全国抗击美帝国主义的人民战争中，涌现出了许多英雄和勇士。他们的英勇事迹，我们应该歌颂，应该感到自豪。
    胡志明主席在讲话中指出，越南全国人民团结一致，越南的军队英勇无比，在世界人民的帮助和支持下，越南必胜，美国必败。
    胡主席说：“但是，美帝国主义的本性是至死不变的，它没有放弃侵略阴谋。因此，我们全国军民必须更加紧密团结，时刻提高警惕，乘胜前进，坚决粉碎它的一切阴谋。我国南北两方三千一百万同胞，不管男女老少，要成为三千一百万歼美救国的英勇战士，坚决夺取最后胜利。”
    胡志明主席最后号召越南全国军民“不怕艰苦牺牲，坚决抗美救国，夺取更多的巨大的胜利，以便完成保卫北方、解放南方、统一祖国的伟大任务。”
    胡主席讲话结束后，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。
    越南人民军总参谋长文进勇上将接着在会上讲话。他说：我们遵照胡主席的教导：“一千七百万北方同胞决心信守誓言，同一千四百万南方骨肉同胞并肩在一起，进行战斗，以解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。”
    他指出，美国强盗正在越南南北两方遭到惨败，但他们还在阴谋扩大侵略战争。美帝国主义越是在侵略的泥潭中滑下去，就越要遭到惨败。
    文进勇最后说：我们的民族是英雄的民族，我们有百战百胜的军队，打的是人民战争，我们一定在保卫北方、解放南方、统一祖国的斗争中取得最后胜利。
    大会最后通过一项决议，号召越南全体军民坚决实现胡主席抗美救国的神圣号召，以“一切为了战胜美国侵略强盗”的精神，加强团结，提高警惕，做到战斗好、工作好，不怕艰苦牺牲，粉碎美国强盗的一切战争“升级”，决心把抗美救国事业引向彻底胜利。
    中国驻越南大使馆临时代办以及各国驻越使节，也应邀出席了这次集会。
