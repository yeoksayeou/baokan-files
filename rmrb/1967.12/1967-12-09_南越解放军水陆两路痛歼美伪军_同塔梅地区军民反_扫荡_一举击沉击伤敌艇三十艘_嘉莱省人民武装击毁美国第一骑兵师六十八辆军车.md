The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has inflicted heavy losses on American and puppet forces in both water and land operations. In the Tame region, military and civilian forces successfully repelled an enemy "sweeping" operation, sinking and damaging 30 enemy boats. In Gia Lai Province, the people's armed forces destroyed 68 vehicles of the U.S. First Cavalry Division.

		NEW DELHI, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) - According to a broadcast by the South Vietnamese Liberation Radio, the military and civilian forces of the Tame region in South Vietnam launched a fierce counterattack on Dec. 4 against an enemy "sweeping" operation, sinking and damaging 30 enemy ships and annihilating more than 1,000 American and puppet troops.

		On Dec. 4, the enemy mobilized five battalions of American and puppet troops, along with the 23rd Fleet of the puppet navy and 100 ships from the U.S. fleet, advancing along the canals towards the border area between My Tho and Sa Dec provinces, targeting the villages of Thuan Hung and Thuan My.

		The military and civilian forces of the Tame region immediately launched a fierce counterattack. At the outset of the battle, the Liberation Army fiercely attacked a U.S. naval flotilla of 47 ships, immediately sinking and damaging five of them. Subsequently, another unit of the Liberation Army encircled this flotilla and launched a fierce assault, sinking 15 more ships. At this point, the enemy dispatched aircraft for bombing and strafing, and used two landing craft to transport 100 soldiers ashore in an attempt to resist. The well-prepared Liberation Army, local forces, and guerrilla units immediately launched a counterattack, annihilating 50 enemy troops and forcing the remaining enemy to flee in disarray. In the afternoon, the Liberation Army launched multiple counterattacks, sinking and damaging another 10 U.S. ships. The report stated that in this battle, a large number of American and puppet troops were killed and wounded, and the enemy's corpses and shipwrecks filled a section of the canal.

		NEW DELHI, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency, the brave armed forces of the people of Gia Lai Province in South Vietnam, on Nov. 24, destroyed 68 vehicles of various types from the U.S. First Cavalry Division on the 19th Highway, annihilating nearly 180 American invaders. The report stated that on Nov. 24, the American bandits mobilized a large number of military transport vehicles, under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, to transport supplies from the An Khe base to Pleiku. The armed forces of the people of Gia Lai Province timely set up an ambush on the 19th Highway, 20 kilometers east of Pleiku City. When the enemy convoy fell into the ambush, the various units of the people's armed forces closely coordinated, cutting off the enemy convoy's head and tail, making the enemy convoy unable to advance or retreat. They used accurate firepower to destroy the enemy's covering convoy of tanks and armored vehicles. At this point, the various assault teams of the Liberation Army bravely charged into the enemy ranks, quickly annihilating the escort troops and destroying all the military vehicles.
