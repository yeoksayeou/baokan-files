Chairman Mao's latest directive states: The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide is excellent, not just good. This also includes the situation in our educational front.

	Studying and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant directive, analyzing the situation of a school, can inspire people to achieve a thorough victory in the educational revolution. However, some students in our school think: The national situation is excellent, but the situation in our class or school may not be good. This way of thinking hinders the resumption of classes and the making of revolution.

	What is the main trend of the current situation in our school?

	Many revolutionary teachers and students discuss: One year ago, the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line was so arrogant in our school. People in the school talked most about their personal future and pursued the first place in scores. Now, revolutionary teachers and students come to school, the first thing they do is wish our great leader Chairman Mao long life, and the first page they open is the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Now everyone thinks most about how to use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize all old systems and regulations in the school, and how to use Mao Zedong Thought to better arm their minds. After resuming classes and making revolution, 32 classes in our school have started studying to criticize and repudiate revisionism and the self. In some classes, students from different factions have now formed mutual help "red pairs." Since Chairman Mao issued the latest directives on the educational revolution, the teaching content of subjects such as language, mathematics, and singing has begun to be reformed in some classes. Many teachers have taken the initiative to go to the classes, humbly listen to opinions, and explore new paths for the educational revolution. This is the situation in our school, an excellent situation.

	In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, the school has commended class collectives that are good at criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the self, revolutionary teachers and students who dare to explore new experiences in the educational revolution, and teachers who dare to take on heavy responsibilities. This makes the broad revolutionary teachers and students not only feel the excellent situation but also more consciously follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to do a good job of resuming classes and making revolution. Now, the attendance rate in general classes has reached about 95%, and some have reached full attendance.

	Through the analysis of the situation, the awareness of revolutionary teachers and students has been raised, and they have better invested in resuming classes and making revolution. Now, our school has entered the stage of fully and systematically exposing the revisionist educational line. We are determined to thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line through teaching practice and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end!

### 正确认识形势　搞好复课闹革命

    正确认识形势　搞好复课闹革命
    毛主席最新指示中说：全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。这也包括了我们教育战线的形势。
    学习和运用毛主席这一英明指示，分析一个学校的情况，就能鼓舞人们去夺取教育革命的彻底胜利。可是，我校有的同学认为：全国形势大好，但本班、本校形势不一定好。这种思想妨碍着复课闹革命。
    什么是我们学校当前形势的主流？
    许多革命师生议论道：一年前，反革命修正主义教育路线在我校是何等神气活现，学校中人们议论最多的是个人的前途，追求的是分数第一。现在，革命师生来到学校，做的第一件事是祝愿我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，打开的第一页书是《毛泽东选集》。现在大家考虑最多的是如何用毛泽东思想批判学校中一切旧制度旧规章，是如何用毛泽东思想更好地武装自己的头脑。复课闹革命后，我们学校有三十二个班开始了斗私批修的学习。在有的班级，原来不同观点的两派同学，现在结成相互帮助的“一对红”。从毛主席发出有关教育革命最新指示后，语文、数学、唱歌等课程的教学内容，在一部分班级都开始有所改革。许多老师主动下到班级，虚心听取意见，探索教育革命的新途径。这就是我们学校的形势，是大好形势。
    在复课闹革命中，学校表扬了斗私批修比较好的班集体，表扬了教育革命中勇于探索新经验的革命师生，也表扬了敢于承担重任的教师。这就使广大革命师生，不但感觉到大好形势，而且更自觉地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，搞好复课闹革命。现在一般班级出勤率达到百分之九十五左右，有的已达到全勤。
    经过对形势的分析，革命师生的认识提高了一步，更好地投入复课闹革命。现在，我校已进入对修正主义教育路线的全面系统揭发阶段。我们决心通过教学实践，彻底批判修正主义教育路线，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！		    北京四十三中  一革命教师
