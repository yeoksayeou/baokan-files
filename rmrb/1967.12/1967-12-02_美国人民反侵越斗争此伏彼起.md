Hundreds of people in San Francisco demonstrated outside the city's army headquarters on November 12 and 13, protesting the military's illegal interrogation of African American soldier Lockman, who refused to participate in the Vietnam War. Some protesters, despite the obstruction of dozens of baton-wielding military police, rushed into the courthouse shouting slogans. Those blocked outside the courthouse engaged in a courageous struggle with the military police.

More than 300 students and staff at the prestigious American university, Yale, jointly issued a statement on November 21, solemnly declaring that they were willing to risk fines of $10,000 and five years in prison rather than enlist during the Vietnam War. The statement emphasized that their refusal to enlist was because they believed the war was unjust.

Recently, students at many American universities have been expanding their protests against the "Dow Chemical Company," which manufactures napalm for the Vietnam War, for recruiting on campus. On November 14, students at the State University of New York held a seven-hour protest demonstration, firmly opposing the company's establishment of a recruitment office on campus. The students surrounded the building where the recruiters were located and held a sit-in protest in the hallways and at the entrances. The authorities hurriedly called in police to "maintain order" and threatened to expel the leaders of the protest.

More than 100 American veterans who had participated in the Vietnam War jointly issued a statement in the New York Times on November 19, protesting the U.S. armed aggression against Vietnam. The statement emphasized that based on their personal experiences in the Vietnam War, they believed the war was unjust and against the interests of the Vietnamese and American peoples. The statement demanded that the U.S. government immediately end the Vietnam War and withdraw its troops from South Vietnam.

Hart, an African American soldier from the Watts area, announced in San Francisco on November 20 that he would rather go to prison for five years than go to South Vietnam to participate in the U.S. aggression there. He stressed, "The battlefield for blacks is in America!"

Another African American youth, Brooks, announced in Nashville, Tennessee, on November 16 that he firmly refused to enlist.

More than 250 students at the University of Wisconsin braved the snow to hold a protest demonstration on campus on November 20, opposing the recruitment of cannon fodder for the Vietnam War by the Navy and Marine Corps.
