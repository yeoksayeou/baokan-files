The liberation armed forces in Western Ninh and other provinces in South Vietnam have achieved new victories in response to the battle call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, bravely fighting the enemy in the winter-spring dry season.

According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces in Western Ninh, Soc Trang, and Ba Xuyen provinces have achieved new victories in response to the battle call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, bravely fighting the enemy in the winter-spring dry season.

The liberation armed forces in Western Ninh Province bravely counterattacked the enemy's "sweeping" operations in the northern part of the province on the 13th and 14th, annihilating three enemy companies, severely damaging three U.S. companies, destroying fifteen armored vehicles, shooting down eleven planes, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

The liberation armed forces in Soc Trang Province, in close cooperation with the guerrilla forces, launched a fierce attack on the enemy's 21st Division, 33rd Regiment, 1st Battalion's base along the Fourth Highway from the night of the 8th to the early morning of the 9th, killing and wounding more than 200 enemy personnel. Previously, on the nights of November 24th and 27th, the liberation armed forces bravely attacked the enemy forces at the Thu Tho Military Training Center, Soc Trang Airport, and the New History Outpost, killing and wounding 140 enemy personnel and destroying five barracks.

The military and civilians in Ba Xuyen Province launched consecutive attacks on the enemy's towns and military outposts from the end of November to the beginning of December, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly 200 enemy personnel, destroying two outposts, four bunkers, shooting down and damaging nine planes, destroying two military vehicles, and blowing up and damaging multiple iron bridges. On the night of December 8th, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce artillery attack on the enemy's military airfield in Ba Xuyen City, the rear base of the 21st Division of the puppet army, and the residence of the puppet provincial governor, killing and wounding nearly 130 enemy personnel and shooting down one plane.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 23rd, the liberation armed forces in South Vietnam blew up a U.S. cargo ship loaded with military supplies on the Saigon River on the 22nd.

According to Western news agencies, the 17,000-ton cargo ship "Sea Train" was fully loaded with military supplies and was waiting to unload on the Saigon River. The clever and brave liberation armed forces of South Vietnam skillfully placed explosives under the ship. After a thunderous explosion, a hole more than two meters in diameter was blown in the ship's bottom, and river water rushed into the cabin. The American bandits on the ship were terrified and in disarray. When they regained their composure and sent patrol boats to "search," the liberation armed forces had already safely retreated.

Previously, on the 21st, a munitions depot at the U.S. base in Lai Thieu, more than 30 kilometers from Saigon, was blown up and caught fire, killing and wounding many U.S. invaders.

    新华社河内二十日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方西宁、朔庄、薄寮省人民解放武装力量，响应越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会的战斗号召，在冬春旱季中英勇杀敌，又取得了新的战果。
    西宁省人民解放武装力量，十三日和十四日两天在西宁省北部地区英勇反击敌人的“扫荡”，歼灭美伪军三个连，重创美军三个连，击毁装甲车十五辆，击落飞机十一架，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    朔庄省人民解放武装力量同游击队密切配合，从八日夜间到九日凌晨，在第四号公路沿线，猛烈袭击伪军第二十一师第三十三团第一营的驻地，打死打伤敌人二百多名。在这以前，十一月二十四日和二十七日两天夜里，人民解放武装力量英勇袭击如托军事训练中心、朔庄机场和新历据点等地的敌军，打死打伤敌人一百四十名，摧毁营房五座。
    薄寮省军民在十一月底到十二月初，接连袭击敌人的各个市镇和军事支区，打死打伤和俘虏敌人近二百名，摧毁据点两个，碉堡四个，击落击伤飞机九架，击毁军车两辆，炸毁、炸坏铁桥多座。十二月八日夜间，人民解放武装力量又猛烈炮击薄寮市的敌军用机场、伪军二十一师的后方基地和伪省长的住宅，打死打伤敌人近一百三十名，击落飞机一架。
    据新华社二十三日讯西贡消息：越南南方人民解放武装力量，二十二日在西贡河上炸坏了美国强盗一艘满载军需品的巨型货轮。
    据西方通讯社报道，这艘载重一万七千吨、满载军需品的巨型货轮“海上火车号”，当时正停在西贡河上等待卸货。机智勇敢的越南南方人民解放武装力量，巧妙地将爆炸物放置在船底下。一声雷鸣般的爆炸声之后，这艘货轮的船底立即被炸出了一个直径两米多的大洞，河水汹涌灌进船舱里。船上的美国强盗吓得魂飞魄散，乱作一团。等他们惊魂稍定，出动巡逻船只去“搜寻”时，人民解放武装力量早已安全撤退了。
    在这以前，距西贡三十多公里的莱溪美军基地的一座弹药库，二十一日被炸起火，并炸死炸伤许多美国侵略军。
