Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the conferment of the honorable title of "Model Unit for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" to the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company of the 601st Unit of the People's Liberation Army, and the honorable title of "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" to Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong. A grand naming ceremony was recently held in Nanchang, the base of the Fourth Platoon.

The ceremony was attended by representatives from many units of the People's Liberation Army, including the "Model Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," the "Model Red Ninth Company for Studying Chairman Mao's Works," the "Red Vanguard Company," the "Steel Eighth Company on the South China Sea Front," the "Red Spearhead Company," the "Pioneer Company for Clearing Mountains and Opening Roads," the "Sea Tiger Boat," the heroic collective of the 1124 Construction Site, the class where Lei Feng served, the class where Wang Jie served, the class where Ouyang Hai served, the class where Xie Chen served, the company where Liu Yingjun served, and the class where LÃ¼ Xiangbi served. Also present were active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the entire army, including Feng Fusheng, Huang Zushi, Sun Leyi, model soldier Wang Yuchang who loves his troops, good soldier of Chairman Mao Nian Siyang, and Air Force pilot Hu Shugen who was awarded the first-class merit citation. Additionally, there were representatives from the active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Jinan Military Region, including Yu Tiansong.

Representatives from the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Jiangxi Province, as well as representatives from the Revolutionary Committee and the People's Liberation Army in Shandong Province, Li Wenzhong's hometown, also attended the ceremony.

The venue was solemnly decorated. In the center of the stage, red flags surrounded a giant portrait of Chairman Mao. On either side hung banners reading, "Long Live Our Great Leader Chairman Mao!" and "Long Live the Great Communist Party of China!" At the main entrance, one side displayed Chairman Mao's quotation: "Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward along the path they paved with their blood!" The other side displayed Vice Chairman Lin's inscription: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The ceremony began solemnly with the song "The East is Red." All attendees, filled with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "Without a people's army, people have nothing. The army must integrate with the people, making the army seen as their own by the people, and then it will be invincible."

Jiangxi Provincial Military Region Political Commissar Cheng Shiqing, on behalf of the Central Military Commission, read the order conferring the honorable titles to the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, and presented the Fourth Platoon with the banner "Model Unit for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and Comrade Li Wenzhong with the banner "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People."

Amidst the music "The Ship Needs a Helm," the current Platoon Leader Pang Chaosheng and Deputy Platoon Leader Ma Shouzheng accepted the banner "Model Unit for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" on behalf of the entire platoon. Company Commander Yang Xiaozhong and Political Instructor Ji Ruihua accepted the banner "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" on behalf of Comrade Li Wenzhong. At this moment, the stage and the audience erupted in joy. People waved their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting with the utmost enthusiasm: "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live! Long Live Forever!"

Yang Dongliang, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and a responsible person from the Jiangxi Provincial Military Region, spoke at the meeting. He said, the Sixth Company of the 601st Unit is a glorious banner of "Supporting the Left and Loving the People" that has emerged in our army during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Fourth Platoon, while escorting the revolutionary masses of the proletariat back to the countryside to make revolution, firmly followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "protect the left," and in the critical moment when the ferry suddenly sank, together with the local revolutionary masses, bravely rescued more than fifty Red Guards and revolutionary masses who had fallen into the water. Communist Party member and Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong, Deputy Squad Leader Li Congquan, and Soldier Chen Diankui sacrificed their lives to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to rescue the Red Guards and revolutionary masses. They are indeed good soldiers who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

Yang Dongliang pointed out that to learn from the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, we must first learn their infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must truly be like them, doing what Chairman Mao loves, supporting what Chairman Mao supports, following Chairman Mao's instructions, and advancing when Chairman Mao waves his hand. We must be like them in carrying out the great historical task of "three supports and two militaries," truly having the stance, thoughts, feelings, and actions of the left. We must always love the revolutionary left, firmly support the revolutionary left, wholeheartedly help the revolutionary left, and humbly learn from the revolutionary left. We must be like them, selfless and fearless, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, making Mao Zedong Thought our soul, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide every second of our lives.

Yang Dongliang hoped that the entire army and people of the province would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," vigorously launch a campaign to learn from the "Model Unit for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Li Wenzhong, further deepen the "Support the Army and Love the People" movement on a larger scale, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, always follow Chairman Mao, and contribute the greatest efforts to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and build a new world bathed in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought.

During the meeting, many units sent congratulatory messages and telegrams. Representatives from various units spoke, unanimously expressing their determination to take the "Model Unit for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Comrade Li Wenzhong as their examples, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, strengthen the ideological revolutionization of the army, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and successfully complete the glorious task of "three supports and two militaries" given by the great leader Chairman Mao, achieving new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Full army active learner of Chairman Mao's works Huang Zushi, on behalf of the advanced collectives and models present, spoke. He said, currently, the world has entered the new era of great Mao Zedong Thought. Whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone of revolution and counter-revolution, true revolution and false revolution. We must definitely take the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong as our examples, with the greatest determination, highest fighting spirit, strongest willpower, and deepest proletarian feelings, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break private interests and establish public interests in an offensive posture, spark a revolution in the depths of our souls, continuously raise our class consciousness in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Representatives from the Jiangxi Provincial Proletarian Revolutionary United Front Preparatory Committee, Jiangxi Provincial Middle and High School Red Guards Headquarters, Jiangxi Cotton Textile and Dyeing Factory Proletarian Revolutionary Masses, Nanchang County Jiangxi Revolutionary Masses, and the rescued Red Guards spoke at the meeting. The representative of the rescued Red Guards excitedly said: Our hearts' reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, and Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the conferment of honorable titles to the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, representing our Red Guards' wishes. Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Diankui, who sacrificed their lives to rescue us Red Guards, and the comrades of the Fourth Platoon who participated in the rescue, are our learning examples. We must learn from them, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, spark a revolution in the depths of our souls, fiercely fight selfishness, and deeply excavate revisionist roots, forever becoming true proletarian revolutionaries.

The representative of the martyrs' families, Li Wenzhong's father Li Huifeng, spoke, saying, to repay Chairman Mao's kindness, defend Chairman Mao, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and defend the motherland, our three families decided to send Wenhong, Congwei, and Dianbing to the army, take up the guns of Wenzhong, Congquan, and Diankui, and continue the revolution.

Li Wenzhong's former comrade-in-arms and current Platoon Leader Pang Chaosheng, on behalf of the Fourth Platoon, swore to Chairman Mao: Dear Chairman Mao! We will definitely hold high your brilliant banner of thought, forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thought, forever loyal to your revolutionary line, and be your good soldiers. We will definitely remember your teachings: "Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind." We will humbly and sincerely learn from the active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the entire army, learn from the heroes and models, learn from the proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guard revolutionary youths, enthusiastically respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"
