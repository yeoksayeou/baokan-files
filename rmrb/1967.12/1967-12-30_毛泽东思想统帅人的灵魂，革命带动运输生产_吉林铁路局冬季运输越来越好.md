The revolutionary workers of the Jilin Railway Bureau, with the help of local military units, have been earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have emphasized proletarian politics, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide the soul, and used revolution to drive transportation production. As a result, their winter transportation tasks have been completed more and more effectively. In the past two months, despite the harsh conditions of wind and snow, the volume of goods shipped by this railway bureau has been increasing month by month. In October, it increased by 11.3 percent compared to September, and in November, it increased by 15.6 percent compared to October. Among these, the shipment volume of key goods such as raw coal and grain has increased significantly in the fourth quarter compared to previous periods. Passenger and freight trains have basically ensured punctual operation.

The Jilin Railway Bureau is responsible for the heavy transportation of various materials in the eastern part of Northeast China. Timber from Changbai Mountain, raw coal from the five major coal mines in Jilin, and grain from the eastern part of Northeast China all need to be transported via the railway lines of this bureau to various destinations. To meet the needs of national construction and people's livelihood, the revolutionary workers of this railway bureau, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have been focusing on revolution and promoting production. While criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the railway system, they have been studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using class struggle and criticism of revisionism as the key, and using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. They have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through these studies, they have promoted revolutionary unity. At the same time, revolutionary workers have conducted specific analyses of cadres, freeing revolutionary cadres. Now, more than 200 stations and segments throughout the bureau have established leadership teams for transportation production.

With the help of the military, the revolutionary workers of this railway bureau have followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." They have applied the army's experience of emphasizing proletarian politics and focusing on the four firsts to transportation production. All work starts from political and ideological work, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the mind, solve people's immediate thoughts, and promote the development of transportation production. All levels of the organization have established and improved leadership mechanisms and systems for studying Chairman Mao's works, and insist on studying Chairman Mao's works. Through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, people's spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes. Revolutionary workers, with deep love for the great leader Chairman Mao, regard "pulling one more ton, loading one more car, and running one more train" as their concrete actions to love Chairman Mao and defend Mao Zedong's revolutionary line. They have taken various measures to shorten vehicle turnover time, completed transportation tasks, and improved transportation efficiency, providing strong support for sister railway bureaus.
