The China-Cambodia Friendship Association held a reception today to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the signing of the China-Cambodia Friendship and Non-Aggression Treaty, as well as the seventh anniversary of the founding of the China-Cambodia Friendship Association. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi attended the reception.

Vice Chairman Zhou Yiping of the China-Cambodia Friendship Association, in his speech, said that the signing of the China-Cambodia Friendship and Non-Aggression Treaty fully conforms to the wishes and interests of the peoples of both countries. We have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely supporting the Kingdom of Cambodia's just struggle to maintain national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, resolutely supporting the Kingdom of Cambodia's just struggle against the aggression of American imperialism and its lackeys, and resolutely condemning the war threats of the U.S. imperialists and the South Vietnamese puppets against Cambodia. If the U.S. imperialists dare to expand the Vietnam War into Cambodia, the Chinese people will, as always, stand on the side of the Cambodian people and pledge to be a strong backbone for the Cambodian people. He said that in the seven years since the founding of the China-Cambodia Friendship Association, efforts have been made to strengthen and enhance the traditional friendship between the two peoples. Continuously consolidating and developing the friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia is the common wish of the peoples of both countries. The plots of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to sabotage the friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia will not succeed. We are convinced that the friendship between the peoples of China and Cambodia will be further consolidated and developed.

Chargé d'Affaires Du Ke Wu of the Cambodian Embassy in China, in his speech, said that the Chinese government and people have continuously given us sincere and strong support, which is a great support for our struggle to defend our homeland and against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. He expressed that if U.S. imperialism expands the Vietnam War into Cambodia, the Cambodian people are determined to fight to the end. He said that the signing of the Cambodia-China Friendship and Non-Aggression Treaty has promoted the traditional friendship between the peoples of Cambodia and China. In the common struggle against imperialism, the friendly relations between Cambodia and China, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, will be further consolidated.

Representatives of revolutionary masses from various sectors, relevant officials such as Qiao Guan Hua, Xie Huai De, Pan Zhen Wu, and other Cambodian friends in Beijing attended the reception.
