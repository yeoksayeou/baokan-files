We became "sisters" in the struggle against self and revisionism.

Worker, Sun Guizhen

This year has been a year of decisive victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it has also been a year of significant achievements for us workers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. I and Xie Dengyi, from being "enemies" became "comrades-in-arms," all thanks to the great thought of Chairman Mao.

We are both workers at the third grain warehouse in Huainan. For over a decade, we never had any arguments or quarrels, and we got along very well. Comrades called us a pair of "sisters."

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to differing viewpoints, we gradually grew apart. Especially after July, instigated by the capitalist roaders within the Party, whenever we saw each other, it was like we were "enemies," calling each other "old conservatives," and things got out of hand, sometimes even leading to physical altercations.

After our great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "struggle against self and revisionism," the PLA comrades helped us set up a study class on Mao Zedong Thought in the warehouse, guiding us to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao truly spoke the words of the working class. I thought, Xie Dengyi and I are both workers, both from poor backgrounds, what fundamental conflicts of interest do we have? What reason do we have not to unite? So, in the study class, I thoroughly struggled against my factionalism and "self," exposing all my shortcomings and mistakes. At the same time, I made a firm decision to find Xie Dengyi, who had not yet participated in the study class, to apologize and make amends.

One evening, I went to Xie Dengyi's house and checked my shortcomings and mistakes. Unexpectedly, she was very cold towards me and said, "You're just pretending to come and deceive me, who needs your self-criticism." Her words made me feel very embarrassed, and in a fit of anger, I left. I thought, I took the initiative to come and criticize myself, and she treats me like this. That night, I couldn't sleep. I turned on the light, took out the shining "Three Articles," and repeatedly compared my thoughts, finally realizing that I had not fully and thoroughly struggled against "self," and had not fully implemented Chairman Mao's instructions.

The next evening, after returning from the study class, it was already past eight o'clock. I was just about to go to Xie Dengyi's house again, but she had been waiting at my house for over two hours. As soon as I stepped in the door, she grabbed my hand and excitedly said, "Guizhen! My attitude last night was bad, I'm sorry for saying you were pretending. After you left, I felt very uneasy and studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with this question in mind, feeling that I was indeed wrong. We are both from poor laboring families, what fundamental conflicts of interest do we have?" She continued, "You took the initiative to talk to me, showing that you have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions well and immediately put them into practice. I have low awareness, blinded by 'self,' and did not act according to Chairman Mao's words, also wronging you. I had dinner and came to apologize to you. I heard you hadn't come back, and I was prepared to come again tomorrow night, but thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, I decided to wait for you to come back." Hearing her say this, my tears couldn't help but well up, and I excitedly said, "Good sister, your thoughts have improved so quickly, showing that you struggle against self and revisionism better than me, I will learn from you. I still have a lot of selfishness, I hope you will help me more in the future."

From that night on, we went from being "enemies" for several months to becoming "sisters" again, studying together, working together, struggling against self and revisionism together, caring for and helping each other, even more intimate than before. Comrades seeing our relationship improved, everyone called us the "sisters" of struggling against self and revisionism.

    俺俩在斗私批修中成了“亲姐妹”
    工人　孙桂珍
    今年，是文化大革命取得决定性胜利的一年，也是我们工人活学活用毛主席著作取得很大成绩的一年。我和谢登义从“冤家”变成“战友”，就靠的是伟大的毛泽东思想。
    我们俩都是淮南第三粮食仓库的女工。十多年来，我们之间从未顶过嘴，吵过架，相处很好。同志们称俺俩是一对“亲姐妹”。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，我俩因观点不同，彼此之间就逐渐疏远了。特别是七月份以后，由于党内走资派的挑动，我们见了面就象“冤家”一样，互相骂“老保”，闹得不可开交，有时甚至要动起手来。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，解放军同志帮助我们仓库办起了毛泽东思想学习班，引导我们学习毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席真是说出了我们工人阶级的心里话。我想，我和谢登义都是工人，出身都很苦，有什么根本的利害冲突呢？有什么理由不搞好团结呢？于是，我就在学习班上狠斗了自己的派性和“私”字，把自己的缺点和错误全都抖了出来。同时下定决心，去找还没有参加学习班的谢登义同志，向她认错和道歉。
    一天晚上，我主动到谢登义家里，向她检查了自己的缺点和错误。谁知她对我很冷淡，还说：“假心假意还要来哄我，谁要你来检讨。”一句话，弄得我很难堪，一气之下跑了回来。心想：我主动找你做检讨，还用这种态度对待我。晚上，我躺在床上怎么也睡不着。我拉开了电灯，翻开金光闪闪的“老三篇”，反复对照自己的思想，才认识到自己还没有做到“完全”“彻底”，“私”字还没有彻底斗倒，没有彻底执行毛主席的指示。
    第二天晚上从学习班回来，已经八点多钟了，正想再到谢登义家去，谁知她早已到我家等我两个多小时了。我刚跨进门，她就一把抓住我的手，激动地说：“桂珍呀！我昨晚的态度很不好，说你是假心假意，很对不起你。你走了以后，我心里很不安，就带着这个问题学习了毛主席的最新指示，觉得自己确是不对头。俺们都是穷苦的劳动人民出身，有什么根本利害冲突？”她接着又说：“你主动找我谈心，是你学习毛主席最新指示学得好，立即落实在行动上的表现。俺觉悟低，叫‘私’字迷住了心窍，没有照毛主席的话办事，也对不起你。我吃过晚饭，跑来找你道歉。听说你还没有回来，我原准备明晚再来，但一想到毛主席的教导，就决心等你回来。”听她这么一说，我热泪止不住夺眶而出，激动地说：“好妹子，你的思想提高得真快，说明你斗私批修比我好，我要向你学习。我私心还很多，希望你今后多多帮助。”
    从这天晚上起，俺俩又从几个月的“冤家”变成了“亲姐妹”，学习在一起，工作在一起，斗私批修在一起，互相关心，互相帮助，比以前更亲近。同志们看着俺俩的关系又改善了，大家都称俺俩是斗私批修的“亲姐妹”。
