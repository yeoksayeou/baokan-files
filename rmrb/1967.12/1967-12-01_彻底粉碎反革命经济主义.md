The great traitor China's Khrushchev is pushing the line of "all-people's unions," "production unions," and "welfare unions." Ultimately, this is aimed at turning the unions into tools for his restoration of capitalism. The "welfare unions" are designed to make us pursue only personal economic interests in the short term, forgetting the fundamental interests of the proletariat, and leading political struggles down the path of economism.

The great traitor China's Khrushchev loudly advocates that the basis for developing production is "increasing personal income and improving personal living standards." He wants the unions to use "distribution" as a driving force, focusing on living conditions to promote production, and emphasizes using living welfare to establish the "authority" of the unions. Another major capitalist-roader in power within the Party also collaborates with China's Khrushchev, singing the same tune, absurdly proposing that within enterprises, the so-called division of labor should be such that "unions mainly handle the living problems of the staff."

Are these two individuals really "concerned about the people's lives"? No, absolutely not!

Look: They use economic bribery and small favors to appease the psychology of a few backward elements among the masses, corrupting the revolutionary will of the masses, making us forget class struggle, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and forget the great historical mission of the proletariat. Is this really "concern" for us?

Look: They promote material incentives in factories and enterprises, spreading the evil wind of economism, to split the unity of the working class, widen the gaps between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and manual labor, destroy the socialist economic foundation, and undermine the dictatorship of the proletariat, aiming to restore capitalism. Is this really "concern" for us?

Look: They use the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in labor movements to replace Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, turning the unions into tools for restoring capitalism, opposing the infusion of Mao Zedong Thought into the working masses, opposing the transformation of unions into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought, making us unwittingly serve their plot to restore capitalism. Is this really "concern" for us?

The so-called "concern" is all nonsense. They are merely using the banner of "concern for workers" to carry out the scheme of restoring capitalism.

The living problems of the masses—should we care about them? Of course, we should.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long taught us: "The living problems of the masses must not be neglected in the slightest, must not be treated lightly." Anyone who neglects the living problems of the masses and is indifferent to their sufferings is not a true proletarian revolutionary.

Chairman Mao has always taught us: "We must educate the union comrades and the working masses to understand that we must not only see the immediate and partial benefits and forget the long-term interests of the working class." Our long-term interests are to seize power, consolidate power, and carry the socialist revolution to the end, gradually achieve the complete victory of the world proletarian revolution, plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world, liberate all mankind, and build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without exploitation.

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." China's Khrushchev's fake concern for the masses, we must genuinely care for. And genuine care, first of all, is to care politically. Infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the masses is the greatest care.

China's Khrushchev wants to turn the unions into tools for restoring capitalism. We must turn the newly established revolutionary mass organizations of the working class into red schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

Let us hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, take "Criticize Revisionism and Repudiate Self" as the guiding principle, thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism, thoroughly shatter the revisionist line in labor movements, and make the workers' movement, under the guidance of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, advance towards the great goal of communism!

    彻底粉碎反革命经济主义
    上海《工人造反报》评论员
    大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫大搞“全民工会”，“生产工会”，“福利工会”这套黑货，归根结底出于一个罪恶目的，这就是要把工会变为他复辟资本主义的工具。而“福利工会”，就是要我们去单纯追求个人眼前的经济利益，忘记无产阶级的根本利益，把政治斗争引向经济主义歧途。
    大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫大肆鼓吹发展生产的基础是“增加个人的收入，改善个人的生活”，要工会以“分配”为动力，抓生活，促生产，还强调要用生活福利去建立工会的“威信”。另一个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，也同中国赫鲁晓夫一搭一挡，一吹一唱，极端荒谬地提出企业内部的所谓分工，规定“工会主要抓职工生活问题”。
    这两个家伙，难道真的是在“关心群众生活”吗？不是，根本不是！
    请看：他们用经济收买的手段，用小恩小惠来迎合少数落后群众的心理，腐蚀群众的革命意志，要我们忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，忘记无产阶级伟大的历史使命，这难道是真正“关心”我们吗？
    请看：他们在工厂企业大搞物质刺激，大刮经济主义妖风，来分化工人阶级的团结，扩大城乡、工农、脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别，破坏社会主义经济基础，瓦解无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟。这难道是真正“关心”我们吗？
    请看：他们用反革命修正主义的工运路线，来代替毛主席的革命路线，把工会变成复辟资本主义的工具，反对把毛泽东思想灌输到工人群众中去，反对把工会办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校，要我们糊糊涂涂地为他们复辟资本主义的阴谋效劳。这难道又是真正在“关心”我们吗？
    所谓“关心”都是鬼话。他们只是打着“关心工人”的旗号，干着复辟资本主义的勾当罢了。
    “福利工会”就是推行反革命经济主义的组织。
    群众的生活问题要不要关心？当然要。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席早就教导我们：“群众的生活问题，就一点也不能疏忽，一点也不能看轻。”谁看轻群众的生活问题，对群众的疾苦漠不关心，谁就不是一个真正的无产阶级革命者。
    毛主席历来教导我们：“应当向工会同志和工人群众进行教育，使他们懂得，决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益。”我们的远大利益就是要夺取政权，巩固政权，将社会主义革命进行到底，逐步实现无产阶级世界革命的完全胜利，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍全世界，解放全人类，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。谁忘记了这个伟大的历史使命，谁也就不是一个真正的无产阶级革命者。
    “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”中国赫鲁晓夫对群众生活是假关心，我们就要真关心。而真正的关心，首先就是要从政治上关心。把毛泽东思想灌输到群众中去，就是最大的关心。
    中国赫鲁晓夫要把工会变成复辟资本主义的工具，我们就要把新建立起来的工人阶级的革命群众组织，办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    让我们高高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，彻底粉碎反革命经济主义，彻底砸烂修正主义的工运路线，使工人运动沿着伟大舵手毛主席所指引的航向，向着共产主义的伟大目标，胜利前进！
