The Malayan newspaper *Frontline* recently published an editorial commemorating the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. The editorial stated: The current world has entered a great era, an era where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is marching towards global victory. This is also the new era of Mao Zedong Thought. At present, the center of the world revolution has shifted from Moscow to Beijing, and the hearts of billions of revolutionary people around the world are united towards Chairman Mao.

The editorial said, the world's revolutionary people are continuing to advance bravely along the path opened by the October Revolution. The editorial pointed out that today's world revolution is much deeper in content, much broader in scale, and much more intense in struggle compared to fifty years ago. Now, the global situation presents a very good revolutionary trend.

The editorial emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great teacher of the contemporary world people, Chairman Mao, has greatly inspired and promoted the victory of the world people's revolution.

The editorial said: Today, the national liberation movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging forward in a magnificent manner. The heroic people of Vietnam's war of resistance against America and for national salvation have set a brilliant example for the world people's struggle against American imperialism and for liberation. The working class in Western Europe, North America, and Oceania has awakened anew and is rising up to strongly oppose their own monopolistic bourgeoisie. The ugly face of modern revisionism, centered around the Soviet revisionists, has been fully exposed.

The editorial said: Although Khrushchev and his successors, the traitorous clique of Brezhnev and Kosygin, have betrayed the October Revolution, betrayed the Soviet people, and betrayed the world revolution, and have become accomplices of American imperialism in oppressing and enslaving the world's people, walking the path of counter-revolution and against the people. However, under the wise leadership of the great teacher of the contemporary world people, Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the world's revolutionary people will surely plant the great red flag of the October Revolution all over the globe.

　　马来亚《阵线报》欢呼世界已进入毛泽东思想的伟大新时代
　　世界革命人民的红心齐向毛主席
　　中国已成为世界革命的中心　文化大革命推动世界革命胜利前进
    新华社十二日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》最近在为纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年而发表的社论中指出：当前的世界进入了一个伟大的时代，即帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，也就是毛泽东思想的新时代。目前世界革命的中心，已从莫斯科转移到北京，世界亿万革命人民的红心齐向毛主席。
    社论说，世界革命人民正继续沿着十月革命开辟的道路奋勇前进。社论指出，今天的世界革命，比起五十年前，内容深刻得多了，规模广阔得多了，斗争激烈得多了，现在全球到处呈现一派大好的革命形势。
    社论强调说，由当代世界人民的伟大导师毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，极大地鼓舞和推动了世界人民革命的胜利前进。
    社论说：今天，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的民族解放运动风起云涌，波澜壮阔地向前迈进。英雄的越南人民的抗美救国战争，为世界人民反对美帝国主义、争取解放的斗争树立了光辉的榜样。西欧、北美、大洋洲的工人阶级有了新的觉醒，纷纷起来大造本国垄断资产阶级的反。以苏修为中心的现代修正主义背叛世界革命的丑恶面目已暴露无遗。
    社论说：虽然赫鲁晓夫及其继任者勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团背叛了十月革命，背叛了苏联人民，背叛了世界革命，甘当美帝压迫与奴役世界人民的帮凶，走上了反革命、反人民的绝路。但是，在当代世界人民的伟大导师毛主席的英明领导下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，世界革命人民必将把十月革命的伟大红旗插遍全球。
