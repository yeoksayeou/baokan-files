Following the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "have soldiers participate in the study classes organized by the army," the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Hangkou swiftly organized numerous study classes of Mao Zedong Thought for both officers and soldiers, which effectively promoted the officers' self-criticism and the rectification of bourgeois tendencies, and advanced the officers' ideological revolutionization. The four articles published here by the officers and soldiers of the Hangkou Air Force vividly illustrate that Chairman Mao's latest instructions not only provide a major measure for solving the officer problem by focusing on education at present but also point out the direction for future officer education. They have extremely profound significance for improving relations between cadres and the masses throughout the Party, the country, and the military.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to transform the Mao Zedong Thought Study Center into a study class of Mao Zedong Thought, inviting soldiers to participate, and actively and humbly learning from the soldiers, treating the soldiers as our teachers, and being willing to be the soldiers' little students.

Our center's practice in learning from the soldiers is to "invite them in and go out to them." Inviting them in means absorbing soldiers who have more contact with us to participate in the center's study. For example, we invited clerks and cooks to study Chairman Mao's works with us, to engage in self-criticism together, and to criticize and repudiate revisionism. Going out means the center's comrades go down to the companies, study with the soldiers, engage in self-criticism together, and criticize and repudiate revisionism.

Practice has proven that studying with the soldiers is excellent. The soldiers have many excellent qualities worth learning from. They have boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. Some days ago, when Chairman Mao's latest instructions on inspecting North China, Central China, and East China were passed down, that very night, from the companies to the headquarters, from the soldiers to the officers, everyone studied and discussed them earnestly. That night, the entire army was boiling with excitement, and no one went to bed on time. A few soldiers in the second company's command instrument class copied down Chairman Mao's latest instructions in full, read them repeatedly, and studied until late at night, around one or two o'clock. They were determined to imprint Chairman Mao's latest instructions in their minds, dissolve them in their blood, and implement them in their actions. A few soldiers in the second battalion went to work forty miles away that morning and returned very tired that evening, but upon hearing that Chairman Mao's latest instructions were being conveyed, no one rested and immediately studied and discussed them with their comrades, repeatedly requesting to go more than twenty miles away to express their firm support for Chairman Mao's latest instructions to our army committee. The soldiers' vivid facts of boundless love for Chairman Mao, for Mao Zedong Thought, and for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply educated us. That night, the comrades in our center also actively studied and discussed the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, just like the soldiers, and expressed their determination to the higher-level party committee, determined to firmly carry out and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Zhang Jianhua, a clerk participating in our center's study, studies Chairman Mao's works very diligently. After seeing Zhang Jianhua's notes on studying Chairman Mao's works, the commander Ma Bingong was deeply moved. Under the soldiers' influence of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the comrades in our center studied Chairman Mao's works even more diligently and were determined to work hard on the "application."

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." Once, the political commissar Zhao Tingchen went to the seventh company for a work assignment. At that time, there was a soldier in the seventh company who saw that the platoon leader did not manage the platoon's work boldly because he was afraid that if he managed too much, the soldiers would criticize him, and he would have a hard time. This soldier, after studying Chairman Mao's works, realized that the platoon leader's lack of boldness in managing was due to fearing the masses, not believing in the masses, and not relying on the masses. He gave the platoon leader some advice, asking the platoon leader to study more of Chairman Mao's works and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly handle the masses, believe in and rely on the masses, and take charge of the platoon's work. Political commissar Zhao Tingchen brought this soldier's situation of helping the platoon leader back to the center for discussion, which greatly educated us. Soldiers nurtured under the boundless sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought are the most intelligent and talented. Political commissar Zhao Tingchen deeply said: "Sometimes, we may not see some problems clearly, but the soldiers can see them clearly. We must learn well from the soldiers and be willing to be the soldiers' little students. Studying together with the soldiers in the study class is the best classroom for learning from the soldiers."

The soldiers actively responded to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," daring to engage in self-criticism with bayonets drawn, daring to launch offensive battles, which is also worth learning from. The soldiers in the second company, in the process of self-criticism and repudiating revisionism, exposed the "self" character, posting it on their beds, on the playground, and on the battlefield. In their words, they expose it wherever they go, fight it wherever they go, and launch offensive and annihilation battles. The soldiers in the second company also issued a proposal for "Ten Criticisms, Ten Repudiations, and Ten Establishments." For example: criticize everything that starts from "me," repudiate "suffering small losses to gain big advantages," and establish a worldview of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people; criticize the purely military technical viewpoint, repudiate the bourgeois line of building the army, and establish Chairman Mao's thoughts and line of building the army, and so on. The soldiers' firm implementation of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions' revolutionary spirit deeply educated us. At the on-site meeting held in the second company, political commissar Zhao Tingchen also introduced the center's study experience of "studying seriously, applying diligently, exposing thoroughly, fighting resolutely, criticizing deeply, and establishing firmly" to everyone. The chief of staff Xue Daosheng and the political department director Ma Wengui also brought the problems reflected by everyone in their daily lives, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles" as weapons, linking them to reality, deeply touching their souls, and going among the masses to engage in self-revolution. They fought the "self" character fiercely, criticized deeply, and had a great determination to change, which also promoted the soldiers.

We adopted the method of "inviting them in and going out to them" to humbly learn from the soldiers, and also promoted the good thoughts, methods, and experiences of the soldiers in the army, thus creating a boiling atmosphere of self-criticism and repudiating revisionism throughout the army. The officers and soldiers are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, create new merits for the people.

　　虚心向战士学习，甘当战士的小学生
　　驻沪空军某团毛主席著作学习中心组
　　遵循伟大领袖毛主席“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的最新教导，中国人民解放军驻沪空军部队雷厉风行，举办了许多干部战士同学习的毛泽东思想学习班，有力地推动了干部的斗私批修，促进了干部的思想革命化。这里发表的驻沪空军部队指战员写的四篇文章，用他们亲身参加学习的体会，生动地说明：毛主席的最新指示，不仅是当前从教育着手解决干部问题的重大措施，而且指明了今后干部教育的方向，对全党全国全军搞好干群关系具有极其深远的意义。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把毛主席著作学习中心组，办成为毛泽东思想学习班，吸收战士参加，主动地、虚心地向战士学习，拜战士为师，甘当战士的小学生。
    我们中心组向战士学习的做法是：请进来，走出去。请进来，就是吸收平时接触我们比较多的战士参加中心组学习。例如，我们请了公务员和炊事员等，和我们在一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私，一起批修。走出去，就是中心组的同志下到连队去，和连队的战士一起学，一起斗私，一起批修。
    实践证明：和战士一起学习好得很。战士有很多优秀品质值得我们学习。他们对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。前些日子，毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的最新指示传下来，当晚从连队到机关，从战士到干部，都热烈认真地学习和讨论起来了。当天夜晚，部队里热气腾腾，谁也没有按时睡觉。二连指挥仪班有几个战士把毛主席的最新指示全部抄写下来，反复读，一直学到后半夜一、两点钟，他们决心把毛主席的最新指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。二营有几个战士，这天早上到四十里以外去劳动，晚上回来很疲乏，可是，听说传达毛主席的最新指示，谁也不休息，立即和同志们一起进行学习讨论，并且一再要求再到二十多里以外向我们部队党委表示坚决拥护毛主席最新指示的决心。战士们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的革命路线无限热爱的生动事实，深深地教育了我们。当天晚上，我们中心组的同志也和战士一样，积极学习和讨论了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，也到上级党委表示了决心，决心对毛主席的最新指示，坚决执行，坚决照办。
    参加我们中心组学习的公务员张建华，学习毛主席著作很努力。部队长马秉公看了张建华学习毛主席著作的心得笔记后，很受感动。在战士们活学活用毛主席著作的推动下，我们中心组的同志更加努力学习毛主席著作，决心在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”政委赵廷臣有次到七连去蹲点。当时七连有一个战士，看到排长对本排的工作管理不大胆，原因是他怕管多了以后战士提意见，自己不好办。这个战士经过学习毛主席著作，认识到排长不敢大胆管理是怕群众，是不相信群众和不依靠群众，便给排长提出意见，要排长多学习毛主席著作，按照毛主席指示办事，正确地对待群众，要相信和依靠群众，把排里的工作抓起来。政委赵廷臣把这位战士帮助排长的情况，带回中心组来讨论，使我们受到了很大教育。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想阳光哺育下成长的战士，最聪明、最有才能。政委赵廷臣深为感动地说：“有时有些问题，我们不一定看得清楚，但战士却能看得清，我们就是要好好地向战士学习，甘当战士的小学生。和战士一起在学习班里学习，就是向战士学习的最好课堂。”
    战士们积极响应伟大领袖毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，斗私敢于刺刀见红，敢于打进攻战的精神，也值得我们学习。二连的战士在斗私批修中，把“私”字亮出来，贴在床头上、操场上、阵地上，用他们的话来说，走到那，亮到那，斗到那，主动打进攻战，打歼灭战。二连战士们还发出了《十斗十批十立》的倡议书。例如：斗一切从“我”出发，批“吃小亏占大便宜”，立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的世界观；斗单纯军事技术观点，批资产阶级建军路线，立毛主席的建军思想和建军路线，等等。战士们坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示的革命精神，深深地教育了我们。在二连召开的现场会上，政委赵廷臣也把中心组的“认真学，刻苦用，彻底亮，坚决斗，狠狠批，决心立”的学习心得，向大家作了介绍。参谋长薛道胜、政治处主任马文贵还带着平时大家反映的问题，以毛主席最新指示和“老五篇”为武器，联系实际，狠触灵魂，到群众中去进行自我革命。他们对“私”字斗的狠，批的深，改的决心大，也对战士是一个促进。
    我们采用“请进来，走出去”的方法，虚心地向战士学习，而又把战士中的好思想、好方法、好经验，在部队中大力推广，因而部队上下出现了热气腾腾的斗私批修的新气象。指战员们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，为人民立新功。（附图片）
    参加人民解放军空军司令部毛泽东思想学习班的干部、战士、职工认真学习、讨论伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“军队办学习班要有战士参加”和《解放军报》的社论《永远做群众的小学生》，决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，把毛泽东思想学习班办好。
