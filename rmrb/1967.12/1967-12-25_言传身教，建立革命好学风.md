Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of study style is a question of the thought method of leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members. It is a question of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. It is a question of the work attitude of all Party comrades. Since this is the case, the question of study style is a very important question, it is the first important question."

After studying Chairman Mao's great teachings, I deeply feel that establishing the revolutionary good study style advocated by Chairman Mao is the guiding principle for running Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Whether or not to establish a revolutionary good study style is a fundamental attitude towards Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Without a revolutionary good study style, Mao Zedong Thought cannot be truly mastered, and the transformation of one's ideology cannot be quickly achieved.

In early October this year, I and several other comrades helped the Revolutionary Committee of Wanquan County, Hebei, to prepare for a Mao Zedong Thought study class. Initially, the study style of this class was not good. Many students knew the "Five Articles" very well, but they could not connect theory with practice. During the "Criticize and Repudiate" meetings, some did not speak, and those who did speak could not touch the soul. Some students talked well in the meetings but could not truly put it into action.

To solve the problem of study style, we reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "They talk about 'connection' every day, but in reality, they talk about 'isolation' because they do not go to connect," "If it is only talked about connecting in words but not connected in actions, then talking for a hundred years is also useless." We analyzed the root cause of the incorrect study style according to Chairman Mao's teachings and found that the problem lay with us, not with the masses. In the process of helping to run the Mao Zedong Thought study class, we had "three more, three less": during organized study, we talked more about big principles and less about personal connection; during the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, we pointed out more and led less by example; when problems arose, we talked more about awareness and less about quick correction. In short, we lacked leading by example and teaching by action, and we did not act as good fighters against selfishness and good students in the study class.

Once the problem was identified, we immediately corrected it. Within the study class, we studied and discussed with everyone, took the lead in exposing our thoughts, and took the lead in struggling against selfishness, truly achieving the integration of learning and practice. We discovered that some comrades in the masses were good at connecting theory with practice, and we immediately praised them and promoted mutual progress. We used the "Five Articles" as a weapon, carried forward the spirit of "spear to spear," and exposed the selfish thoughts hidden deep in our souls. We exposed them and struggled against them, changing as we struggled, and achieved immediate results.

The students saw that we dared to expose our selfishness, dared to struggle against it, exposed it thoroughly, and corrected it quickly, and they were very moved. They said: The PLA comrades learn a little and use a little, say what they do, expose selfishness without beating around the bush, struggle against it without leaving face, struggle fiercely, and correct quickly. They have set a good example for us, shown us a good way, and we should follow their example. The study class showed a new study style of actively learning and using the "Five Articles." Everyone took Zhang Zedong, White Stone, and Old Fool as shining examples, connected their thoughts and work, and consciously checked and examined themselves, achieving the goal of fiercely struggling against selfishness and strongly criticizing revisionism. Several leaders of revolutionary mass organizations who had long been in conflict not only seriously criticized themselves in the meeting but also exchanged hearts with each other. After the study class ended, they all achieved revolutionary great unity and together studied and released a batch of revolutionary cadres, greatly promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Through this experience of helping the revolutionary masses to run a Mao Zedong Thought study class, I deeply felt that to establish a revolutionary good study style, the leftists must take the lead and must be both propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and fighters against selfishness and revisionism. They must take the lead in learning and using Chairman Mao's instructions and not be mere talkers of revolution. Only by speaking and acting, setting a good example, and showing a good way can we truly help the revolutionary masses to quickly establish a revolutionary good study style and run a good Mao Zedong Thought study class.

### 言传身教，建立革命好学风

    言传身教，建立革命好学风
    北京部队某部五好战士　张崇发
    毛主席教导我们：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”
    学习了毛主席这一伟大教导，我深刻体会到，建立毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，是办好毛泽东思想学习班的指针。建立不建立革命的好学风，是对待马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的根本态度问题。没有革命的好学风，毛泽东思想就不能真正学到手，就不会尽快实现人的思想革命化。
    今年十月初，我和其他几个同志帮助河北万全县革委会筹备小组举办毛泽东思想学习班。这个学习班的学风起初不太好。许多学员“老五篇”学得很熟，但理论不能联系实际。开“斗私，批修”讲用会，有的不发言，有的虽然发言，但不能触及灵魂。部分学员在会上谈得很好，却不能真正落实到行动上。
    为了解决学风问题，我们重温了毛主席的教导：“他们天天讲‘联系’，实际上却是讲‘隔离’，因为他们并不去联系”，“如果只是口头上讲联系，行动上又不实行联系，那末，讲一百年也还是无益的。”我们按照毛主席的教导，认真分析了学风不正的原因，发现根子在我们身上，而不是在群众身上。我们在帮助办毛泽东思想学习班的过程中，存在着“三多三少”：组织学习时，讲大道理多，结合自己少；斗私批修时，指指点点多，亲自带头少；有了问题后，空谈认识多，迅速改正少。一句话，以身作则差，言传身教少，没有当好斗私批修战斗员和学习班的好学员。
    问题找到了，就马上改正。在学习班内，我们和大家同学习，同讨论，带头亮思想，带头斗“私”字，切实做到学用结合。发现群众中理论联系实际好的同志，立即大力表扬，互相促进。我们以“老五篇”为武器，发扬刺刀见红的精神，把隐藏在自己灵魂深处的私心杂念亮出来，亮了就斗，边斗边改，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    学员们看到我们敢于亮私，敢于斗私，亮得彻底，改得迅速，很受感动。他们说：解放军同志学一点用一点，说到做到，亮私不绕弯子，斗私不留面子，斗得狠，改得快，为我们作出了好样子，引出了好路子，我们也要照着干。学习班出现了活学活用“老五篇”，学了就用的新学风。大家纷纷以张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象作榜样，联系自己的思想和工作，自觉地对照检查，做到狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义。有几个长期闹对立的革命群众组织的负责人，不仅在会上认真地做自我批评，还在一起交了心。学习班结束后，全部实现了革命的大联合，并且一起研究，解放了一批革命干部，极大地促进了革命的“三结合”。
    通过这次帮助革命群众举办毛泽东思想学习班，我深深体会到，要建立革命的好学风，支左人员必须首先带头，一定要做到既是毛泽东思想宣传员，又是斗私批修战斗员。对毛主席的指示要带头学、带头用，不当口头革命派。只有言传身教，作好样子，引好路子，才能真正帮助革命群众迅速建立起革命的好学风，办好毛泽东思想学习班。
