The revolutionary workers of Beijing Knitting Factory and the People's Liberation Army leftists held a symposium.

		The revolutionary workers of Beijing Knitting Factory and the People's Liberation Army leftists have been studying Chairman Lin Biao's calligraphy "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" and the editorials "Learning Mao Zedong Thought Must Combine Study and Application, Seeing Results Immediately" from the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily. They held symposiums to resolve to better study Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions, to implement them promptly and thoroughly, to be revolutionaries who link theory with practice, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

		Firmly Implement Chairman Mao's Teaching on Combining Theory with Practice

		Leftist Li Kaijun said: To study Chairman Mao's works well, we must implement the principle of combining theory with practice, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to study with problems in mind, to learn and apply actively, to combine learning with application, to learn what is urgently needed first, and to see immediate results. We must strive to apply Mao Zedong Thought to all our practices.

		In the past, the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing did everything they could to prevent us from studying Mao Zedong Thought and maliciously slandered Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on combining study with application. After one and a half years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing have been overthrown and denounced by the hundreds of millions of soldiers and people across the country. Their conspiracy to restore capitalism and sabotage our study of Mao Zedong Thought has failed. A large-scale, in-depth campaign to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought is vigorously unfolding across the country.

		From my experience, to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, we must constantly struggle against the "self" in our minds. Only by persisting in this struggle can we truly love, believe in, admire, and be loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Only by persisting in this struggle can we correctly understand Chairman Mao's teachings and not adopt a utilitarian attitude towards them, talking nicely but actually pursuing individualism, factionalism, and anarchism.

		Struggle Against Selfishness and Eliminate Factionalism: The Key to Learning and Applying Mao Zedong Thought

		Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee Xing Yunyou said: To truly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, we must struggle against selfishness and eliminate factionalism. In the previous stage, before our factory achieved revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination," our organization also studied Chairman Mao's works, but sometimes with factionalism mixed in, wrongly using Chairman Mao's teachings to serve our factional interests. Selectively and distortingly quoting a sentence from Chairman Mao to serve factional interests is to deviate from Mao Zedong Thought.

		After the arrival of the PLA leftists, they helped us struggle against petty-bourgeois factionalism. When we studied Chairman Mao's works again, the situation was different. For example, before the formation of the factory's "three-in-one combination" leadership, some comrades in our organization proposed a full election, opposing the consultation of candidate lists. If this were done, the other side, due to their smaller numbers, would not only find it difficult to enter the factory revolutionary committee but also to be elected in most workshops. This proposal was driven by factionalism. Facing this situation, with the help of the PLA comrades, we guided the masses to study Chairman Mao's instructions on considering the overall situation and the revolutionary committee's representativeness and proletarian authority. We explained that we must act from the highest interests of the Party and the fundamental interests of the proletariat, not from individualism and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The broad masses grasped Mao Zedong Thought, and the factory's "three-in-one combination" leadership was formed relatively smoothly.

		This incident tells us: Only by overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism can we truly master Mao Zedong Thought. As leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, we must take the lead in struggling against selfishness and factionalism, leading the masses to thoroughly expose petty-bourgeois factionalism.

		With the Struggle Against Selfishness and Revisionism as the Guideline, Actively Learn and Apply Mao Zedong Thought for Life

		Director of the Revolutionary Committee Cheng Yucai said: From more than a year of the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply feel that only by eliminating the bourgeois "self" can we study Mao Zedong Thought and achieve immediate results.

		Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I did not link the study of Chairman Mao's works with reality well and did not use them enough to transform my worldview. Therefore, in the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I did not understand Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and stood against the revolutionary masses. When I first went to the Mao Zedong Thought study class, due to my heavy selfishness, I did not link the study of "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" with self-criticism but instead picked on the "mistakes" of the revolutionary masses. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to struggle against selfishness and revisionism, with the patient help of the PLA leftists, I struggled against the "self." When I studied "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" again, I realized that I had indeed made mistakes. Following Chairman Mao's latest instruction to "send cadres to go down and walk around, look around," I went to the masses to check my mistakes, listen to criticism, and seek opinions. The broad revolutionary masses enthusiastically helped me, educated me, encouraged me, and invited me to participate in the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership. From this, I realized that without resolving to eliminate selfishness, one cannot study Chairman Mao's works, let alone achieve immediate results.

		The editorials of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily point out that studying Mao Zedong Thought "is to use it, to solve problems, which means to struggle against selfishness and to criticize revisionism." I will use Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism for life, strive to transform myself, and become a true proletarian revolutionary.

		Implement Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions Without the Slightest Deviation

		Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee He Genlin said: Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are the beacon guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory. Whether we follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions step by step and implement them without the slightest deviation is the touchstone to distinguish between complete revolutionaries and verbal revolutionaries, between true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries. True revolutionaries must implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions without the slightest deviation. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do; we implement each sentence and each word firmly. Our factory's two revolutionary mass organizations achieved revolutionary unity exactly by following Chairman Mao's instructions. Some comrades who initially had doubts now say: We followed Chairman Mao closely and followed him correctly. For Chairman Mao's instructions, we implement them firmly whether we understand them or not, and we understand them in practice. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we strike; we are never wrong.

		Some comrades in our factory, after the two revolutionary mass organizations achieved revolutionary unity, still had the "self" and factionalism in their minds, obstructing the consolidation and development of revolutionary unity and the implementation of the "three-in-one combination." At this time, Chairman Mao issued the great call to struggle against selfishness and revisionism. Initially, we did not understand these golden words deeply. However, we implemented them firmly. Comrade Lin Biao's important speech on October 1 conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With the help of the PLA leftists, we studied and discussed them the same afternoon and started Mao Zedong Thought study classes a few days later. Initially, the leaders of the two factions still had some reservations and were not willing to expose their selfishness. Later, through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and struggling against selfishness and revisionism, both sides made self-criticisms and exposed their "self." Comrades said, loving Chairman Mao and implementing Chairman Mao's instructions means being consistent in words and deeds, in appearance and reality, and not being verbal revolutionaries. In the learning process, we checked our mistakes, and the other revolutionary mass organization's comrades also checked their mistakes. Through both sides exposing and struggling against selfishness, everyone's feelings became more harmonious. Thus, we felt Chairman Mao's latest instructions more intimately.

		Regarding the liberation of cadres, initially, due to factionalism, we thought those who "came out" on our side were good, and those who "came out" on the other side should all be overthrown. After Chairman Mao issued the latest instruction that "correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the 'three-in-one combination,' consolidating revolutionary unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform in our units, and it must be resolved," we restudied Chairman Mao's teachings on cadre policy and realized that judging a cadre's good or bad should not be based on which side they stand on but whether they stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For cadres who have made mistakes, we should allow and help them correct their mistakes and use them boldly. This is also a sign of whether we truly listen to Chairman Mao's words or not. Because we implemented Chairman Mao's latest instruction, now, most of the cadres in our factory who have made mistakes have stood on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    努力紧跟　深刻领会　联系实际　句句照办
    活学活用毛泽东思想做完全的革命派
    北京针织总厂革命职工和解放军支左人员举行座谈会
    本报讯　北京针织总厂的革命职工和驻厂的解放军支左人员，连日来认真学习林彪副主席的题词“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”和《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论《学习毛泽东思想要学用结合，立竿见影》。他们纷纷举行座谈会，决心更好地学习毛主席著作和最新指示，雷厉风行地见之于行动，坚决地、全面地、不折不扣地贯彻执行，做理论联系实际的完全革命派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。	坚决实行毛主席关于理论和实践相结合的教导
    支左人员李开军说：我们要想学好毛主席著作，必须实行理论和实践相结合的原则，按照林副主席的指示，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫。我们每一个解放军指战员，都必须以林彪副主席为榜样，自觉地、积极地学习毛泽东思想，并把它用到自己的一切实践中去。
    过去，中国赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀、罗瑞卿等反革命修正主义分子，千方百计地不让我们学习毛泽东思想，并且恶毒地诋毁林彪副主席关于学用结合的指示。经过一年半的无产阶级文化大革命，中国的赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，已经被全国亿万军民斗倒、斗臭了。他们为了复辟资本主义而破坏我们学习毛泽东思想的阴谋破产了。一个大规模的深入的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，在全国蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。
    根据我的体会，要想把毛泽东思想真正学到手，必须不断地同自己头脑中的“私”字作斗争。只有坚持斗私，才能真正做到对毛主席、对毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。只有坚持斗私，才能正确领会毛主席的教导，而不会从私心杂念出发，对毛主席的教导采取实用主义的态度，口里讲得好听，实际上搞的是个人主义、小团体主义、无政府主义。	狠斗私心，克服派性，是学好用好毛泽东思想的关键
    厂革命委员会副主任邢云有说：要想真正学好毛主席著作，用好毛主席著作，必须狠斗私心，克服派性。前一阶段，在我们厂还没有实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的时候，我们那个组织也学习毛主席著作，但是，有时候夹杂着派性，便错误地引用毛主席的教导来为自己的派性服务。断章取义地、歪曲地引用毛主席的某一句话来为自己的派性服务，这就背离了毛泽东思想。
    解放军支左同志到我们工厂以后，帮助我们狠斗小资产阶级派性，再学习毛主席著作，情况就不一样了。例如，在产生厂里的“三结合”领导班子之前，原来我们这个组织里的同志有人提出要全面进行选举，不同意协商提候选人名单。如果这样做，对方由于人数少，不但很难选入厂革命委员会，而且在多数车间也很难当选。这种主张就是派性作怪。针对这种情况，我们便在解放军同志帮助下，引导群众学习毛主席关于要顾全大局和革命委员会要有代表性、要有无产阶级权威的指示，说明我们办事情一定要从党的最高利益出发，要从无产阶级的根本利益出发，而不要从个人主义和小资产阶级的派性出发。广大群众掌握了毛泽东思想，厂里的“三结合”领导班子就比较顺利地产生了。
    这件事情告诉我们：只有克服小资产阶级的派性，才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手。作为革命群众组织的负责人，一定要带头斗私心，斗派性，带动群众把小资产阶级派性彻底搞臭。	以斗私批修为纲，活学活用一辈子毛泽东思想
    厂革命委员会主任程育才说：从一年多来轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，我深深体会到，只有把资产阶级的“私”斗掉，学习毛泽东思想才能做到学用结合，立竿见影。
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，我学习毛主席著作联系实际差，用于改造自己的世界观不够，因此在无产阶级文化大革命的初期，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线很不理解，站到革命群众的对立面去了。刚到毛泽东思想学习班的时候，由于自己的私心重，学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》，不联系自己作自我批评，而是挑革命群众的“差错”。毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大战斗号令以后，在支左的解放军同志的耐心帮助下，我狠斗了“私”字，再学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》时，就发觉自己的确是犯了错误。我按照毛主席“干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看”的最新指示，到群众中去检查错误，听取批评，征求意见。广大革命群众热情地帮助我，教育我，鼓励我，并吸收我参加了革命“三结合”的领导班子。从这里我体会到，不下决心破私，学习毛主席著作就学不进去，更不用说学用结合，立竿见影了。
    《人民日报》和《解放军报》的社论指出，学习毛泽东思想“要用，要解决问题，就是要斗私，要批修”。我要用毛泽东思想斗一辈子私，批一辈子修，努力改造自己，做一个真正的无产阶级革命者。	不折不扣地执行毛主席的最新指示
    厂革命委员会副主任贺根林说：毛主席一系列的最新指示，是指引无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的明灯。对毛主席的最新指示，是不是步步紧跟，是不是不折不扣地执行，是鉴定完全革命派还是口头革命派、真革命还是假革命的试金石。真正的革命派，就要不折不扣地执行毛主席的最新指示，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么办，句句照办，字字照办，坚决照办。我们厂的两大革命群众组织实现革命大联合的时候，就是按照毛主席的指示做的。开始有些思想不通的同志，现在也都说：我们跟毛主席跟得紧，跟对了。对毛主席的指示，理解的我们要坚决照办，暂时不理解的也要坚决照办，在实践中去理解。毛主席指到哪里，我们就打到哪里，准没错。
    我们厂的部分同志，在两大革命群众组织实现革命大联合以后，头脑里仍然存在着“私”字、派性，阻碍着革命大联合的巩固和发展，阻碍着革命“三结合”的实现。这时候，毛主席发出了要斗私，批修的伟大号召。对这金光闪闪的五个大字，开始，我们理解并不深。但是，我们坚决照办了。林副主席十月一日的重要讲话，传达了毛主席的最新指示，我们在支左解放军的帮助下，当天下午就开会研究，没过几天就办起了毛泽东思想学习班。开始，两派负责人彼此还有些戒心，不肯亮私。后来，通过学习毛主席的最新指示，开展斗私批修，双方都作了自我批评，把“私”字亮了出来。同志们都说，热爱毛主席，执行毛主席的指示，就要言行一致，表里一致，不能做口头革命派。在学习过程中，我们检查了自己的错误，另一个革命群众组织的同志也检查了他们的错误。通过双方亮私斗私，大家的思想感情越来越融洽了。这样，我们更加感到了毛主席最新指示的亲切。
    对于解放干部，开始由于派性作怪，认为“亮”在自己组织一边的就是好的，“亮”在对方一边的都得统统打倒。毛主席发出“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好”的最新指示以后，我们又重新学习了毛主席关于干部政策的教导，认识到看一个干部的好坏，不能看他站在那一派，要看他是不是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上。对于犯了错误的革命干部，要允许和帮助他们改正错误，放手地使用他们。这也是真听毛主席的话还是假听毛主席的话的一个标志。由于执行了毛主席的这一最新指示，现在，我们厂犯了错误的干部，绝大部分已经站到毛主席的革命路线上来了。
