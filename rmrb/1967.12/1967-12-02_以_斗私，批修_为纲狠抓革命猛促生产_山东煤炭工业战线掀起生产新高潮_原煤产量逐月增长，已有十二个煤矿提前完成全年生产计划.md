The revolutionary and production situation in the coal industry of Shandong Province is getting better and better. The broad revolutionary masses of workers are resolutely implementing the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, through the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, have ignited an unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm, and have launched a new high tide of seizing revolution and promoting production.

In September, the province's coal production increased by 21% compared to August, and in October, it increased by 7% compared to September. By November 25, local state-owned coal mines had completed 97.6% of the state's coal production plan. Among the state-owned and local state-owned coal mines, Suncun, Huting, Hewan, Wujing, Tangzhuang, Wannan, Zhu Chen, Buzhen, Balitun, Quangou, Tangcun, and Kuangshan mines have either completed or overfulfilled their annual production plans ahead of schedule. Huting, Hewan, and Wujing mines have also completed their increased production plans. The broad revolutionary masses of workers have loudly proclaimed: Let's put in another effort in the last month of 1967 to produce more coal for the state. At the same time, they are hastening to prepare for creating conditions to strive for greater victories in 1968.

The broad revolutionary masses of workers and revolutionary cadres in the coal industry of Shandong Province have taken Chairman Mao's great instruction of "seizing revolution and promoting production" as their motto. They make revolution above ground and engage in production below ground, insisting on making revolution on the spot, making revolution in their spare time, and making revolution through economy. They learn from the People's Liberation Army, strengthen their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, overcome anarchist and individualist thoughts, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions to mine coal for the revolution.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to struggle against selfishness and revisionism, the broad revolutionary masses of workers responded enthusiastically and resolutely carried it out. Each mine held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The workers used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to struggle against selfishness and revisionism, planting Mao Zedong Thought deeply in the soul of each person. Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread, people's spiritual outlook has been completely renewed, promoting the revolutionary criticism to develop more deeply, further promoting the revolutionary great alliance, strengthening and consolidating the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and at the same time, it has also exerted boundless power in production.

Under this great situation, the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the leadership of the Jinan Military Region held a provincial coal production conference in late November to organize and mobilize for a new upsurge in coal production. Wang Xiaoyu, the head of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and Yang Guofu, the deputy commander of the Jinan Military Region, attended the meeting and spoke. The meeting required that in the course of carrying out large-scale coal production, the mines should first seize the revolution, emphasize the good situation, propagate and study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, repeatedly study the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the workers on the coal industry front, take the struggle against selfishness and revisionism as the key link, further carry out the thought revolution of the people, raise the awareness of the workers to mine coal for the revolution and work for the revolution. The meeting also required that old and new cadres help each other, and all cadres should go deep into the production front line, together with the workers to seize the revolution and promote production. Strengthen and replenish the leading cadre team, organize the revolutionary and production enthusiasm of the masses.

    据新华社济南三十日电　山东省煤炭工业战线革命和生产形势越来越好。广大革命职工坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，通过斗私批修，激发起冲天的革命干劲，掀起了抓革命、促生产的新高潮。
    九月份全省原煤产量比八月份增长百分之二十一，十月份又比九月份增长百分之七。到十一月二十五日止，地方国营煤矿已完成国家原煤产量计划的百分之九十七点六。国营和地方国营煤矿中，已有孙村、湖田、河湾、五井、汤庄、汶南、朱陈、埠村、八里屯、泉沟、唐村、矿山等十二个矿提前完成或超额完成了全年生产计划。湖田、河湾、五井等矿并且完成了增产计划。广大革命职工响亮地提出：再加一把劲，在一九六七年最后一个月为国家增产更多的煤炭。同时，加紧做好准备工作，为在一九六八年争取更大的胜利创造条件。
    山东省煤炭工业战线上的广大革命职工和革命干部，把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示作为座右铭。他们上井闹革命，下井搞生产，坚持就地闹革命、业余闹革命、节约闹革命。他们向解放军学习，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，克服无政府主义和个人主义思想，坚决执行毛主席的指示，为革命而采煤。
    毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大战斗号召后，广大革命职工热烈响应，坚决照办，各矿纷纷举办毛泽东思想学习班。职工们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，让毛泽东思想在每个人的灵魂深处牢固地扎下根子。毛泽东思想空前大普及，人的精神面貌焕然一新，推动了革命大批判更深入地发展，进一步促进了革命的大联合，加强和巩固了革命的三结合，同时在生产方面也发挥出无穷无尽的威力。
    在一片大好形势下，山东省革命委员会和济南部队领导机关在十一月下旬召开了全省煤炭生产会议，为促进煤炭生产新高涨作了组织动员和战斗部署。山东省革命委员会主任王效禹和济南部队副司令员杨国夫出席会议并讲了话。会议要求各煤矿在开展煤炭大生产时首先要抓好革命，大讲特讲大好形势，宣传和学习毛主席的最新指示，反复学习中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给煤炭工业战线职工的信，以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步搞好人的思想革命化，提高职工们的觉悟，懂得为革命而采煤，为革命而工作。会议还要求新老干部互相帮助，所有干部都要深入生产第一线，与工人一起抓革命促生产。加强和充实领导班子，把群众的革命和生产热情组织起来。
