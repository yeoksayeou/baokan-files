Ambassador Wu Mingluan's Speech at the Capital's Celebration of the 7th Anniversary of the Establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam

Comrades,

Today, we are able to join our flesh-and-blood southern brothers and sisters to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in the great rear base of the People's Republic of China, the great rear base of both the North and South of Vietnam. We feel extremely happy. First of all, please allow me to, on behalf of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China and the people of North Vietnam, extend our greetings to comrades and friends, expressing our determination to defeat the U.S. aggressors!

The delegation from our heroic southern compatriots, who have endured hardships and overcome numerous difficulties, has come to the great rear base to participate in this joyous celebration. We extend our warm congratulations to the delegation.

Comrades,

The seven years since the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have been a short period. However, it is precisely during this short period that the heroic southern military and civilians, under the wise and correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have overthrown the reactionary regime of Ngo Dinh Diem, defeated the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys' special warfare, and are now defeating the U.S. imperialists' strategy of localized warfare, achieving great victories.

In the past seven years, on the small piece of land in South Vietnam, covering only 170,000 square kilometers, a great fact has emerged. This is that the 14 million people of South Vietnam are defeating 120 million U.S. expeditionary forces, puppet troops, and mercenaries equipped with various modern weapons and war tools. This is that the head of imperialism, U.S. imperialism, is mired in the quagmire of the South Vietnamese battlefield, and their fate can only be complete failure. This is that the people of South Vietnam are fighting stronger and stronger, fighting more and more victories, while the more U.S. imperialism sends troops, the greater their failure, the more they expand the war, the more miserable their defeat. This is that in this fierce and intense struggle in South Vietnam, the strong and steadily advancing force is not the 120 million U.S. puppet troops and mercenaries, but the people of South Vietnam under the wise and correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The 7th anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam comes at a time when the southern military and civilians have achieved even greater victories on all fronts than ever before. Building on the victories of last winter, spring, and summer, the southern military and civilians are advancing with even greater confidence, with an overwhelming momentum, into the winter and spring seasons, and will certainly smash the U.S. imperialists' third dry season strategic plan. In response to the National Liberation Front's call for decisive victory in the winter and spring seasons, the southern military and civilians have achieved brilliant victories in just the first two months, inspiring all compatriots nationwide. In the battles of Luc Ninh, Phu Phu, Dinh Tu, Binh Dinh, My Tho, Gia Lai, Quang Nam, Quang Tri, Thua Thien, Di Linh, and Tra Vinh, the recent rapid development of the southern military and civilians has been demonstrated.

These victories are the result of the combination of political struggle and armed struggle under the strong leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the victory of the three armed forces and various branches of the South working in harmony, the victory of the coordination of various battlefields from the Western Highlands, the Southern East Zone, the Mekong Delta to the Central Middle Zone and the Central South Zone, as well as the mountains, rural areas, and cities. It is the victory of the flexible and effective use of various combat methods of highly developed people's war.

The military victories of the southern military and civilians have further expanded their political victories. The political program of the National Liberation Front and the recent series of victories have more clearly shown that the National Liberation Front truly holds the initiative in the situation in the South and is the only true representative of the people of South Vietnam. The just struggle of the South Vietnamese people has won the warm support of progressive humanity. The prestige of the National Liberation Front on the international stage has been increasingly enhanced.

One victory after another, as the copper wall and iron wall of the motherland, the people of the South have fully realized the words of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Comrade Ho Chi Minh, in his New Year's greetings this spring: "To make the South resound with victory reports and flowers."

Comrades,

To save its heavy defeat in South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has launched a war of destruction against North Vietnam. Over the past three years, it has dropped tens of thousands of tons of bombs from the Vinh Linh area to the province of Lang Son, from coastal areas to mountainous areas. In recent months, it has also bombed and strafed our capital, Hanoi. They thought that bombs could make the people of North Vietnam surrender, could separate North and South Vietnam, and could stop the support of the people of the North for their flesh-and-blood southern compatriots. But this is just a crazy dream that will never come true. Vietnam is a whole, the Vietnamese nation is a whole, the people of North and South Vietnam are flesh-and-blood brothers, they are brothers and sisters of the same family, this is a truth that no powerful force can erase.

The people of the North, in the ten years of peaceful socialist construction, have always thought of their half of the country still being trampled by the iron hooves of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. In our peaceful labor and production, every basket of grain produced, every new factory and school built, is for our flesh-and-blood southern compatriots. Now, every Northerner, under the guidance of the Labor Party and the beloved Comrade Ho Chi Minh, deeply feels that every escalation of war by U.S. imperialism against the North is a sign of its defeat in the southern battlefield. The more it fails in the South, the more it escalates against the North.

The people of the North have made up their minds in this war against destruction, have made sacrifices, are still shedding blood and sacrificing, and are prepared to endure even greater hardships and sacrifices in the future, so that in any situation they can fulfill their duty as the rear base to the front line.

The people of the North, in response to the call of the Labor Party and Comrade Ho, for the sake of their flesh-and-blood southern compatriots, are fighting while producing. Although the war is extremely fierce, the socialist construction and the consolidation of people's power in the North are still steadily strengthening. Industrial and agricultural production, as well as cultural, educational, and health work, not only have not stagnated but have developed even more than in peacetime. U.S. imperialism has lost more than 2,640 aircraft of various types and thousands of air pirates on the North Vietnamese battlefield, but it has not achieved any strategic goals. The national economy of the North is still developing, and transportation is still unobstructed. The people of the North turn their hatred of U.S. imperialism into strength, resolutely defeat U.S. imperialism's war of destruction, fulfill their duty to their southern compatriots, and will not let them down.

Recently, the military and civilians of the North, in response to the call for decisive victory in the winter and spring seasons by the National Liberation Front and as a tribute to the 7th anniversary of the National Liberation Front, are launching a production and combat competition. Thousands of factories, construction sites, farms, and offices are launching competition movements, determined to complete and overfulfill the 1967 production plan for their flesh-and-blood southern compatriots. When the southern compatriots achieved victory after victory in the first two months of the winter and spring seasons, the military and civilians of the North also shot down 260 U.S. aircraft in the same period, averaging 130 aircraft per month, and killed and captured many U.S. air pirates.

The victories achieved by the southern military and civilians in this winter and spring season are greater than any victories achieved in the same period in the past. The military and civilians of the North shooting down 260 U.S. aircraft in the past two months is also an unprecedented event.

The military and civilians of the North, like the military and civilians of the South, are advancing with even greater momentum on the basis of victory, determined to strengthen production and combat, stand side by side with their southern compatriots, endure all hardships and sacrifices, and will not let down the southern compatriots who are on the front line of the motherland. Every Northerner takes "for the sake of our flesh-and-blood southern compatriots," "everything for the front line," and "everything to defeat the U.S. aggressors" as the starting point for all activities. The military and civilians of the North are ready at any time to endure all sacrifices and severe tests to contribute to the greater victories of their southern compatriots in the winter and spring seasons.

Comrades,

At present, U.S. imperialism is in a desperate situation. It cannot escape its fate of defeat under the fierce attacks of the military and civilians of North and South Vietnam. However, it is still unwilling to give up its aggressive ambitions and is plotting to intensify the war, expanding it to North Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and the Kingdom of Cambodia, seriously threatening the independence of the countries of Indochina and Southeast Asia. While carrying out military activities, U.S. imperialism is also playing a very cunning "peace talks" trick in the United Nations to ease world and U.S. public opinion. These opinions are strongly condemning the Johnson group's aggression against Vietnam, demanding that U.S. imperialism must unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, withdraw all U.S. and mercenary troops from South Vietnam, and recognize the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people.

The people of North and South Vietnam strongly condemn the above-mentioned evil plots of U.S. imperialism to domestic and world public opinion.

The military and civilians of the North have made up their minds that no matter how fiercely U.S. imperialism bombs the North or takes the risk of landing troops in the North, the people of the North will, together with the people of the South, thoroughly realize the sacred call of Comrade Ho to "defend the independence of the motherland, fulfill the obligations to the various nations fighting against U.S. imperialism, unite the entire people and army, fear no hardships or sacrifices, and fight to the end for complete victory," and resolutely and thoroughly accomplish the tasks of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately unifying the motherland.

Comrades,

Vietnam and China are brotherly countries. In the process of revolutionary struggle, we have always been united. The unity between our two parties and peoples has been tested in the struggle against our common enemy, imperialism led by U.S. imperialism. The people of North and South Vietnam have always received the support and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people led by the beloved Comrade Mao Zedong in the past anti-war and the current anti-U.S. struggle. The Chinese government and people, while providing tremendous and effective material assistance, have also repeatedly expressed their unshakable position, that is, to firmly support the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. war of national salvation until final victory. The seven hundred million brothers of the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, have made up their minds to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely fight side by side with the Vietnamese people to defeat the U.S. aggressors. Comrade Mao's statement on the situation in South Vietnam in 1963 and the Chinese government's repeated condemnations of U.S. imperialism's bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam since 1964 have greatly encouraged the people of North and South Vietnam. We are deeply moved by the great and enthusiastic support of the people of the great People's Republic of China for the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. war of national salvation. On Chinese soil, from people's communes to factories, from schools to PLA units, from plains to mountains, from borders to islands, people in all places are carrying out the movement to support Vietnam and resist the U.S. with a brotherly and comradely spirit. On this occasion, please allow me to express the sincere thanks of the Vietnamese people to the beloved Comrade Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the brotherly Chinese people.

In this atmosphere of flesh-and-blood, North-South reunification, close unity, and great Sino-Vietnamese fighting friendship, I sincerely wish the brotherly Chinese people greater victories in socialist construction and the proletarian cultural revolution.

Long live Comrade Mao!

Wishing Comrade Lin Biao good health!

Long live Sino-Vietnamese fighting friendship forever!

Wishing Premier Zhou Enlai good health!

Wishing Comrades Kang Sheng, Li Fuquan, Chen Yi, and Xie Fuzhi good health!

Wishing you all good health!

On December 19, Premier Zhou Enlai, Comrade Kang Sheng, Comrade Li Fuquan, and other responsible comrades received the entire delegation of the South Vietnamese People's Delegation led by Comrade Nguyen Van Long, Deputy Comrade Le Thi Chi, and Comrade Son Lu.

On December 19, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council received Comrade Msekwa, the Executive Secretary of the Tanganyika African National Union of Tanzania, and the entire delegation of the Tanzanian Alliance Friendship Delegation led by him, and took a group photo with them.

    美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。但是，一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。他们必然要采取军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，来挽救自己的灭亡。而革命人民在取得最后胜利之前，也必然会遇到各式各样的困难，但是，这些困难都是可以克服的，任何困难都阻挡不住革命人民的前进。坚持下去就是胜利。我深信，越南人民坚持持久战争，一定能够把美国侵略者从越南赶出去。

　　亲爱的阮春龙团长，
　　亲爱的阮文广同志，
　　同志们：
    今天，我们能够同自己的骨肉南方兄弟姐妹们一道，在越南南北两方的大后方——伟大的中华人民共和国，参加越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年纪念日，感到万分高兴。首先，请允许我代表越南民主共和国驻华大使馆和越南北方人民，向同志们和朋友们致以决心打败美国侵略者的敬礼！
    来自雄伟的西原山林、肥沃的南部平原、坚贞不屈的广治承天的亲兄弟姐妹——英雄的越南南方人民代表团，他们经过艰苦斗争的岁月，克服了重重困难，并取得了胜利，今天来到大后方参加纪念这个欢腾的节日，我们向代表团表示热烈的祝贺。
    同志们，
    越南南方民族解放阵线成立后的七年，只是短暂的时间。但是，正是在这短暂的时间里，英雄的南方军民在越南南方民族解放阵线的英明正确领导下，推翻了吴庭艳反动政权，打败了美帝国主义及其走狗的特种战争，目前正在打败美帝国主义的局部战争战略，取得了节节巨大的胜利。
    七年来，在面积只有十七万平方公里的狭小的越南南方土地上，已经出现一个极其伟大的事实。
    这就是，我们越南南方一千四百万人民正在打败拥有各种现代化武器和战争工具的一百二十万美国远征军、伪军和仆从军。
    这就是，帝国主义的头子美帝国主义正在越南南方战场上深陷泥沼，而它们的下场只能是遭到彻底的失败。
    这就是，越南南方人民愈打愈强，愈打愈胜，而美帝国主义越是增派军队，它们的失败就越大，它们越扩大战争，失败得也就越惨。
    这就是，在越南南方这样一场残酷激烈的搏斗中，强大和稳步前进的，并不是一百二十万美伪军和仆从军，而正是在越南南方民族解放阵线英明正确领导下的越南南方人民。
    越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年纪念日，是越南南方军民在各战场上取得比以往任何时候更加巨大胜利的时候到来的，越南南方军民在去冬今春和夏秋季取得了胜利的基础上，继续奋勇前进，在政治纲领和南方第二次英模大会的鼓舞下，更加信心百倍，以排山倒海之势跨进了冬春季，并且必将粉碎美帝国主义的第三次旱季战略计划。南方军民为响应南方民族解放阵线关于冬春季坚决取胜的号召，仅在冬春季开始后的两个月来，已经取得了辉煌的胜利，使得全国同胞感到振奋。在禄宁、福平、德都、槟椥、美萩、嘉莱、广南、广治、承天、迪石、芹苴等的各次战斗中，表明了越南南方军民最近期间的飞跃成长。
    这些胜利，是在越南南方民族解放阵线坚强领导下，进行政治斗争与武装斗争相结合的胜利，是南方三种武装力量和各兵种巧妙配合的胜利，是从西原、南部东区、湄公河平原到中部中区和中部南区的各战场以及山区、农村、城市之间巧妙配合的胜利，是灵活和有效地运用高度发展的人民战争的各种作战方法的胜利。
    越南南方军民在军事上的胜利，进一步扩大了在政治上的胜利。民族解放阵线的政治纲领和最近接连取得的胜利，更突出的说明，民族解放阵线真正掌握了南方局势的主动权，是越南南方人民唯一真正的代表。南方人民的正义斗争博得了进步人类的热烈支持。民族解放阵线在国际舞台上的威望日益得到了提高。
    一个胜利接着一个胜利，做为祖国铜墙铁壁的南方人民，圆满地实现了全体越南人民伟大领袖胡志明主席今年春节的贺词中所说的，做到全南方“捷报频传赛花多”。
    同志们，
    美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南南方的惨重失败，对越南北方进行了一场破坏性战争。三年多来，它向从永灵区到谅山省、从沿海地区到山区，投下了数十万吨炸弹，最近几个月来，它还对我国心脏——首都河内进行轰炸扫射。它们以为炸弹能使越南北方人民屈服，能把越南南北两方分割开来，能阻止北方人民对自己骨肉的南方同胞的支援。但这只是白日做梦，是永远不能得逞的疯狂幻想。越南是一个整体，越南民族是一个整体，越南南北两方人民是骨肉兄弟，是同父的弟兄和一家亲人，这是任何强大力量也抹杀不了的真理。
    北方人民在自由、和平的社会主义建设十年中，时刻都想到自己的半壁河山还为美帝国主义及其走狗的铁蹄所蹂躏着。我们在和平的劳动生产中，增产的每一担谷子，新建的每一座工厂、学校，都是为了自己骨肉的南方。目前，受到越南劳动党和敬爱的胡志明主席教导的每一个北方人，都深刻地体会到，美帝国主义对北方的每一次战争升级，都是它在南方战场上又吃了败仗的表现。它在南方越是失败，对北方就越升级。
    北方人民在这场反对破坏性的战争中，已经下定了决心，曾经做出了牺牲，现在还在流血牺牲，并且准备将来还要忍受百倍巨大的艰苦牺牲，以便在任何情况下都能胜利地履行大后方对大前线的义务。
    北方人民响应劳动党和胡主席的号召，为了骨肉的南方，边生产边战斗。虽然战争非常激烈，但北方的社会主义建设和巩固人民政权的工作，仍在稳步的加强。工农业生产以及文化教育卫生等各方面工作不但没有停滞，相反，还比和平时期更为发展。美帝国主义在越南北方战场上损失了二千六百四十多架各种新式飞机以及成千名飞贼，但它仍然达不到任何战略目的。北方的国民经济仍然继续发展，交通运输仍然畅通无阻。北方人民把对美帝国主义的仇恨化为力量，坚决打败美帝国主义的破坏性战争，履行对南方同胞的义务，绝不辜负南方同胞。
    最近，北方军民为响应南方民族解放阵线冬春季决胜的号召，和为民族解放阵线成立七周年献礼，正在开展生产与战斗竞赛运动。成千个工厂工地、农场和机关开展了竞赛运动，为骨肉的南方，决心完成和超额完成一九六七年的生产计划。当南方同胞在冬春季头两个月取得了节节胜利的时候，北方军民也在同时期内，打下了美国飞机二百六十架，平均每个月打下一百三十架，打死和活捉了许多美国飞贼。
    南方军民在这个冬春季所取得的胜利，比过去任何同时期内所取得的胜利都要大。北方军民在过去的两个月里击落二百六十架美国飞机，也是一个空前未有的事件。
    北方军民正象南方军民一样，在胜利基础上奋勇前进，决心加强生产与战斗，与南方同胞并肩在一起，经受一切艰苦和牺牲，绝不辜负站在祖国最前线的南方同胞。北方的每一个人都在以“为了骨肉的南方”“一切为了前线”“一切为了打败美国侵略强盗”作为各项活动的出发点，北方军民随时准备忍受一切牺牲和严峻的考验，为南方同胞取得冬春季更加巨大的胜利做出贡献。
    同志们，
    目前，美帝国主义正处于走投无路的困境。它在越南南北方军民猛烈打击下，是无法摆脱失败命运的。但是它还不肯放弃侵略野心，并且正在阴谋强化战争，把战争扩大到越南北方、老挝王国和柬埔寨王国，严重威胁着印度支那和东南亚各国的独立。美帝国主义在进行军事活动的同时，还在联合国玩弄极其狡猾的“和谈”骗局，以和缓世界和美国人民舆论。这些舆论正在愤怒谴责约翰逊集团的侵越战争，要求美帝国主义必须永远无条件停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸，把美军和仆从军全部撤出越南南方，要承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南方人民唯一真正的代表。
    越南南北两方人民向国内和全世界舆论强烈控诉美帝国主义上述的险恶阴谋。
    北方军民下定了决心，尽管美帝国主义对北方进行怎样激烈的轰炸，或者冒险地派军队在北方登陆，北方人民仍将同南方人民一道彻底实现胡主席神圣的抗美救国号召“为了保卫祖国的独立，为了履行对正在反对美帝国主义的各个民族所承担的义务，我国全民和全军团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利”，坚决彻底实现解放南方、保卫北方、进而统一祖国的任务。
    同志们，
    越南和中国是兄弟国家，在革命斗争过程中一直是团结在一起，我们两党两国人民之间的团结，在反对共同敌人以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义斗争中，经受了考验。越南南北两方人民在过去的第一次抗战中和目前的反美战斗中，一向得到以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民的支持与援助。中国政府和人民在给予了巨大的和有效的物质援助的同时，并且多次表示自己始终不渝的立场，即坚决支持越南人民抗美救国战争，直到取得最后胜利。用毛泽东思想武装起来、正在进行轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的七亿兄弟的中国人民，已经下定了决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决同越南人民并肩战斗打败美国侵略者。毛主席一九六三年对越南南方局势的声明和中国政府一九六四年以来多次谴责美帝国主义轰炸越南民主共和国的声明，大大地鼓舞了越南南北两方人民。我们对伟大的中华人民共和国各地人民对越南人民抗美救国战争的巨大、热情的支持，深为感动。在中国国土上，从人民公社到工厂、从学校到解放军单位，从平原到山区、从边疆到海岛，各地人民都怀着兄弟般和同志式的心情开展着援越抗美运动。趁此机会，请允许我向敬爱的毛主席、中国共产党、中国政府和兄弟的中国人民，表示越南人民真诚的感谢。
    在这骨肉的、南北团聚的、亲密团结和充满着伟大的越中战斗友情的气氛中，我衷心地预祝兄弟的中国人民在社会主义建设和无产阶级文化大革命中将取得更加巨大的胜利。
    祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    祝林彪副主席身体健康！
    越中的战斗友谊万古长青！
    祝周恩来总理身体健康！
    祝康生同志、李富春同志、陈毅同志、谢富治同志身体健康！
    祝同志们身体健康！（附图片）
