The revolutionary movement has further boosted labor enthusiasm, and the broad masses of peasants are striving to achieve a bumper harvest.

The broad masses of agricultural laborers in Albania have actively responded to the call of the Party of Labor to increase grain production and achieve grain self-sufficiency. They have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, laying a solid foundation for the rapid completion of this year's wheat and other late autumn crop sowing plans and for achieving a bumper harvest next year.

In the revolutionary movement, the broad masses of peasants in Albania, through studying the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor and recent documents, have further raised their ideological awareness and labor enthusiasm, bringing about a new look in production. By the beginning of November, the national wheat sowing plan had been completed by 94%. Shkodër, Lezhë, Mirditë, Gjirokastër, and 11 other districts, as well as 17 state farms, have completed or overfulfilled the wheat sowing plan.

In addition, the wheat sowing area in various districts of Albania this year has increased compared to last year.

In the wheat sowing work, the members of various places have also paid attention to using local and external effective advanced experiences.

To ensure the rapid completion of the autumn sowing tasks, the state has provided strong support to the countryside in terms of seeds, fertilizers, manpower, and materials, especially to newly established mountainous agricultural production cooperatives.

　　革命化运动使劳动热情更加高涨
　　广大农民奋发图强夺取粮食丰收
    阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者积极响应劳动党关于增产粮食，实现粮食自给的伟大号召，发扬自力更生、奋发图强精神，为迅速完成今年小麦和其它晚秋作物的播种计划，夺取明年粮食丰收打下扎实的基础。
    阿尔巴尼亚广大农民在革命化运动中，通过学习劳动党第五次代表大会决议和最近的各项文件，思想觉悟进一步提高，劳动热情更加高涨，使生产出现新的面貌。到十一月上旬，全国小麦播种计划已经完成了百分之九十四。斯库台、莱希、米尔迪塔、吉诺卡斯特等十四个区和十七个国营农场已完成或超额完成小麦播种计划。
    另外，今年阿尔巴尼亚各区的小麦播种面积都比去年有所增加。
    各地社员在小麦播种工作中，还注意运用本地和外地创造的行之有效的先进经验。
    为了确保秋播任务的迅速完成，国家从种子、肥料、人力物力上大力支援农村，特别是支援新成立的山区农业生产合作社。
