The Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association delegation, led by Comrade Shefqet Peçi, returned to Beijing by plane from Shanghai this evening after visiting various places in southern China and participating in activities celebrating the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation.

The delegation conveyed the deep revolutionary friendship of the Albanian people towards the Chinese people and their unreserved support for the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The delegation was warmly welcomed by revolutionary masses wherever they went.

During their stay in Shanghai, the delegation visited the site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Comrade Shefqet Peçi wrote an inscription after the visit, praising the spark that ignited the Chinese revolution from this place, leading to great victories and putting China on the glorious path of building socialism and communism. He said, "All the achievements on this glorious path are due to the far-sighted and correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, directly led by the tested helmsman and outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong."

Comrade Shefqet Peçi also praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao, as a beacon for the progress of humanity. He said that the Albanian people firmly support and highly value the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

During their stay in Shanghai, the Albanian comrades also visited the Industrial Exhibition and several factories. Comrade Shefqet Peçi encouraged the workers to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, to regard Mao's books as their daily spiritual sustenance, to further master Mao Zedong Thought, and to achieve even greater victories on the road ahead.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua and Albanian Ambassador to China Natanaeli welcomed the delegation at the airport today.

Central Committee member and Deputy Minister of Defense Wang Shusheng, and Albanian Military Attaché Hatu accompanied the delegation back to Beijing.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai revolutionary masses held a grand gathering on December 13 to warmly welcome the delegation led by Comrade Shefqet Peçi. The masses held up "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong," expressing the deep proletarian internationalist friendship between the peoples of China and Albania.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and responsible officials of the People's Liberation Army in Shanghai, Li Shiying, Ji Yingwu, and Feng Guozhu, as well as Wang Shusheng, who accompanied the delegation to Shanghai, attended the meeting.

After the meeting began, the entire audience read aloud quotations from our great leader Chairman Mao and quotations from the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. Comrade Li Shiying spoke at the meeting. He said that the heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour, have shown proletarian heroism by standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, achieving brilliant victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. In recent years, the Albanian Party of Labour, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has creatively applied Marxist-Leninist theory to the revolutionary practice of their country, launching and leading a massive revolutionary movement, enriching the experience of the international dictatorship of the proletariat.

Comrade Li Shiying then talked about the tremendous victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country over the past year and a half under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Shefqet Peçi spoke amidst enthusiastic applause. He said that the Albanian people enthusiastically hail the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the historic victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by the beloved leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, over the reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi. The victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is a victory of Marxism-Leninism over modern revisionism. This shows that the Chinese Cultural Revolution has world-historical significance.

Amidst enthusiastic applause and cheers, the comrades from China and Albania exchanged banners.

The delegation arrived in Shanghai by train from Hangzhou on December 12.

On the evening of December 13, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held a banquet to welcome the delegation. Comrades Li Shiying and Shefqet Peçi spoke at the banquet, expressing their heartfelt wishes for the everlasting friendship between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania.
