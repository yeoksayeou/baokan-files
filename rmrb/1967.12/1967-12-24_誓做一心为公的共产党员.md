    Pledge to Be a Selfless Communist Party Member
    Radar Station Squad Leader, Zhang Qunying, of a certain Air Force Unit

    The Chinese Khrushchev, using the megaphone of the bourgeoisie, shamelessly propagandizes: "Those party members who endure hardships first and enjoy benefits later are our good party members. Although they may temporarily suffer some personal losses, they are, or will eventually be, trusted and respected by the people and the masses." He uses this to incite people to use "temporarily suffering some personal losses" as a means to gain the trust and respect of the masses; he even uses this individualistic trick as the standard for a "good party member." This is a gross slander against Communist Party members.

    Why do Communist Party members take on heavy burdens and endure hardships? Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties." The comrades at our radar station, following Chairman Mao's teachings, take on heavy burdens and endure hardships for the needs of the revolutionary struggle and to solve the difficulties in the development of the revolutionary cause.

    The high mountains where we built our station are steep, densely forested, full of thorns, and the weather is unpredictable. There are also wild beasts and poisonous snakes. For many years, these mountains were uninhabited. However, when we thought about building the station on the high mountains to carry out Chairman Mao's strategic policy of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and to defend Chairman Mao and the socialist homeland, we all volunteered to join the "pioneer team." We carried a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and a pickaxe, and on the steep cliffs, we chiseled out small holes and climbed up by holding onto vines. Comrades said: "The mountain is high, but our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is higher; the rocks are hard, but our resolve to follow Chairman Mao in revolution is firmer." In the process of breaking through the mountains and digging holes, the more dangerous the task, the more we rushed forward. Comrades remembered Chairman Mao's words: "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, that is a good comrade." In carrying out arduous and dangerous tasks, comrades composed a ditty: "The radar station is built on a cloudy mountain, the valley is hot and the mountain is cold. Climbing up and down, each mountain is more difficult than the last. Carrying sand, shoulders are swollen, digging holes, hands are worn out. Eating pickled vegetables, living in thatched huts, fetching a bucket of water requires climbing the mountain. Others say it is bitter, we say it is sweet. The high mountains are a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the construction site is a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works." In our hearts, there is a red sun, and all difficulties are trivial.

    We can take pride in taking on heavy burdens, find joy in overcoming hardships, fear neither hardship nor death, and complete our tasks victoriously. This is because we remember Chairman Mao's teachings, determined to "put revolutionary interests as our first priority" and "wholeheartedly serve the people"; determined to "transform the objective world and also transform our subjective world." In the process of breaking through the mountains and chiseling the rocks, fighting against nature, we also, with the spirit of breaking through the mountains and chiseling the rocks, launch an offensive against the "self" in our minds.

    The Chinese Khrushchev uses gaining the trust and respect of the masses as the standard for a "good party member," poisoning party members with the bourgeois worldview of seeking personal fame and gain, turning them into tools for restoring capitalism. We must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line, and eliminate all its poisonous influences.

    誓做一心为公的共产党员
    航空兵某部雷达站班长　张群英
    中国赫鲁晓夫舞弄着资产阶级的喇叭筒，狂吹什么：“那些吃苦在前，享福在后的党员，是我们的好党员，虽然在某些个人享受上，他们暂时吃一点亏，然而他们是，或者最后是，为我们大家及群众所信任，所尊敬的。”他就是这样无耻地煽动人们以“暂时吃一点亏”为手段，去猎取群众对自己的“信任”和“尊敬”；甚至把这种个人主义的骗术，作为“好党员”的标准。这是对共产党员的极大污蔑。
    共产党员要去挑重担，去吃苦，是为了什么呢？毛主席教导说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”我们雷达站的同志们，就正是遵照毛主席的教导，为了革命斗争的需要，为了解决革命事业发展中的困难，去抢挑重担，去争先吃苦的。
    我们建站的高山，坡陡林密，荆棘丛生，风雨无常，加上猛兽出没，毒蛇挡道，多少年来荒无人迹。但是，我们想到高山建站是执行毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针，是为了保卫毛主席，保卫社会主义祖国的江山，便都抢先报名参加“开路先锋队”。我们带一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，背一把铁镐，就在坚硬的峭壁上凿出一个个小洞，蹬着小洞攀藤附葛往上爬。同志们说：“山高，没有我们无限忠于毛主席的觉悟高；石坚，没有我们紧跟毛主席干革命的意志坚。”在开山打洞中，任务越是危险，我们越是抢着前去，同志们都记着毛主席的话：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”在执行艰苦、危险的任务中，同志们编顺口溜唱道：“雷达站，建在云雾山，山下酷暑山上寒。爬上又爬下，一山更比一山难。挑沙肩压肿，打洞手磨烂。吃咸菜，住草房，打壶清水要翻山。别人说它苦，我们说它甜。高山是毛泽东思想的大学校，工地是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。”心中有个红太阳，千难万苦只等闲。
    我们能够以抢挑重担为光荣，以战胜艰苦为快乐，不怕苦，不怕死，胜利完成任务，这是因为我们牢记毛主席的教导，决心“以革命利益为第一生命”，“全心全意地为人民服务”；决心“改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界”。我们在劈山凿石，同大自然作斗争中，也以劈山凿石的精神，对自己头脑里的“私”字打进攻战。
    中国赫鲁晓夫把猎取群众对自己的“信任”和“尊敬”，作为“好党员”的标准，就是用贪图“个人名利”的资产阶级世界观毒害党员，把他们变成复辟资本主义的工具。我们一定要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，肃清它的一切流毒。
