The great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory in 1967, the year in which China's agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented comprehensive harvest. From the Great Wall to the Yangtze River, across the vast countryside of China, everything is flourishing and joyous. Hundreds of millions of peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside are enthusiastically celebrating: This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and a glorious achievement of the further popularization of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside.

Last year was the year when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was successfully launched nationwide, and it was also the year when China's agricultural production achieved the largest and most comprehensive harvest since liberation. This year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, and the harvest of various crops is generally better than last year, with many crops seeing significant increases in production. The ironclad facts once again prove that Chairman Mao's teaching of "grasp revolution, promote production" is an unshakable great truth; the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for our cause to advance from victory to greater victory.

The main indicator of China's agricultural production achieving an unprecedented comprehensive harvest this year is: the yield of grain crops, which form the foundation of agriculture, has increased significantly compared to the highest level in history last year. Important economic crops such as cotton, oilseeds, sugarcane, hemp, tobacco, as well as fruits, silkworm cocoons, and livestock, except for a few, have all exceeded or far exceeded the highest annual production levels in history. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "...Agricultural production is the first priority in our economic construction work. It not only needs to solve the most important problem of food, but also needs to solve the problem of providing raw materials for daily necessities such as clothing, sugar, and paper, i.e., cotton, hemp, sugarcane, and bamboo, etc." He also pointed out: "In agriculture, in addition to grain and vegetables, raising pigs and sheep to solve the problem of meat is also very important." This year, grain and various economic crops have all had bumper harvests, and the number of pigs, sheep, cattle, and other livestock raised in various places is also higher than in previous years. This fact shows that China's agricultural production is advancing victoriously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. With the comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture, a new situation of overall economic prosperity will soon appear across the country.

Another important indicator of China's agricultural production achieving an unprecedented comprehensive harvest this year is: whether in the originally high-yielding southern regions or the low-yielding northern regions, the harvests are unprecedented in history. This is particularly evident in the northern regions. This shows that the long-standing low-yielding situation in the north can be changed, and the key lies in the revolutionization of people's thinking. The surging revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has produced tremendous material strength when applied to production. Originally, many grain-deficient areas in the north that needed grain support from the south have now basically achieved grain self-sufficiency or surplus, and there are fewer areas where grain is still insufficient. The long-standing situation of "southern grain to the north" is beginning to change. With the comprehensive bumper harvests in the south and north, the national grain reserves and the grain reserves of production teams have increased, and the foundation of the collective economy is more robust. This is a major event of great strategic significance that boosts morale.

The process of achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture over the past year is, fundamentally, a process of continuously arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought and promoting the continuous revolutionization of people's thinking. Chairman Mao teaches us: "...The correct ideology of the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force for transforming society and the world." The comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture this year is the result of hundreds of millions of peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside becoming even more enthusiastic about studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, transform everything, and promote everything. Many people and cadres, when reviewing the year's struggle practice, all say: agricultural bumper harvests come from the revolutionization of thinking, and the revolutionization of thinking comes from studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This feeling is very true and profound.

This spring, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was surging forward with irresistible momentum and the rural spring plowing was in full swing, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party colluded with landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to spread a counter-revolutionary economic wind, spreading capitalist poison, and attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and spring plowing. Faced with this situation, the broad masses of peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forget class struggle" and "grasp revolution, promote production," and studied the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country." They gained great strength and resolutely launched a courageous counterattack against the class enemies, firmly shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production, and smashing the class enemies' evil plots to sabotage revolution and production. Afterwards, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, enthusiastically joined the struggle of revolutionary criticism, and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in various places, angrily exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchov, such as the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "exploitation has merit," "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," and "preservation of the rich peasant economy." In the process of revolutionary criticism and study, people studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, especially studying and applying the "Three Old Articles," breaking down the "self," establishing the "public," breaking down revisionism, establishing Mao Zedong Thought, and promoting the revolutionization of thinking. Through revolutionary criticism and study, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside has been continuously raised, and they are determined to overcome all difficulties to strive for dual victories in revolution and production.

To achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture, both the southern and northern regions have carried out large-scale rural infrastructure construction. Great efforts have also been made in reforming production technology. Over the past year, the supply and purchase of various agricultural machinery, irrigation equipment, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides have all increased to varying degrees compared to last year. All of these have played a significant role in this year's comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture.

"Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people." The comprehensive bumper harvest in China's agriculture this year is inseparable from the strong support of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Starting from spring, the PLA, following Chairman Mao's instructions, sent tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to various rural areas, vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought, assisting local peasants and revolutionary cadres in implementing the great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." The broad ranks of PLA soldiers and officers have carried forward the glorious tradition of being both a fighting force and a work team and a production team, taking the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisting on fighting shoulder to shoulder with poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, and making great contributions to achieving dual victories in revolution and production.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which states: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." Over the past year, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has developed more broadly and deeply, China's agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented comprehensive bumper harvest, forcefully proving that this proposition is a great truth. The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries who hate and fear China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have repeatedly claimed that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will "destroy" industrial and agricultural production and "disrupt" China's national economy. The facts of history have declared the complete failure of these "prophets."

Currently, in the vast rural areas of China, the flames of revolution are burning, and the tide of production is surging. The situation is excellent and getting better. Hundreds of millions of peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside are resolutely responding to the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out criticism and self-criticism," launching a new high tide of criticism and self-criticism. They are determined to take "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out criticism and self-criticism" as the key link, grasp revolution, and vigorously promote production, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and strive for an even greater and more comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture next year.

    毛泽东思想在广大农村进一步普及的辉煌成果
    我国农业生产空前全面大丰收
    亿万农民群众和农村革命干部贯彻执行毛主席抓革命促生产的伟大方针，在人民解放军的大力支援下，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋，获得了粮食作物和各类经济作物普遍丰收，历史上长期存在的“南粮北调”的情况开始改变。铁一般的事实，宣告了帝、修、反对我国文化大革命和农业生产的诬蔑的彻底破产。
    据新华社二十六日讯　伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的一九六七年，我国农业生产获得了空前未有的全面大丰收。长城内外，大江南北，我国辽阔的农村，到处欣欣向荣，一片欢腾。亿万农民群众和农村革命干部满怀激情地热烈欢呼：这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想在广大农村进一步普及的辉煌成果。
    去年，是我国无产阶级文化大革命在全国范围内胜利开展的一年，也是我国解放十七年来农业生产获得最大和最全面丰收的一年。今年，我国无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利，各类农作物的收成，又普遍比去年还要好，其中不少作物比去年有大幅度增产。铁的事实再一次证明：毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，是一个颠扑不破的伟大真理；战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我们的事业从胜利走向更大胜利的根本保证。
    今年我国农业生产获得空前未有的全面大丰收的主要标志是：作为农业基础的粮食作物的产量，同创历史上最高水平的去年相比，又有较大的增长，重要经济作物棉花、油料、糖料、麻类、烟叶，以及果品、蚕茧、牲畜等，除个别的外，也都超过或者大大超过历史上的最高年产水平。毛主席早就指出过：“……农业生产是我们经济建设工作的第一位，它不但需要解决最重要的粮食问题，而且需要解决衣服、砂糖、纸张等项日常用品的原料即棉、麻、蔗、竹等的供给问题。”又指出：“农业方面，除粮、菜外，饲养猪羊，解决肉食，也是很要紧的。”今年，粮食和各类经济作物普遍丰收，各地饲养的猪、羊、牛等也比往年多。这一事实表明：我国农业生产正沿着毛主席指引的道路胜利地向前发展。随着农业的全面大丰收，整个国民经济全面高涨的新局面，必将迅速地在全国出现。
    今年我国农业生产获得空前未有的全面大丰收的另一重要标志是：无论是原来生产水平较高的南方地区，或是生产水平较低的北方地区，收成之好都是历史上罕见的。这在北方地区表现得尤为突出。这就说明：历史上长期存在的北方低产的面貌是可以改变的，关键在于人的思想革命化。广大农民群众和农村革命干部在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲用于生产，就产生了巨大的物质力量。原来北方许多需要从南方调粮支援的缺粮区，现在基本上都已做到粮食自给或自给有余，粮食仍然不足的地区已经不多了。历史上长期存在的“南粮北调”的情况，现在开始改变。随着南北各地农业全面大丰收，国家粮食库存和社队粮食储备都有了增加，集体经济的基础更加雄厚，这是一件具有重大战略意义的振奋人心的大事。
    一年来夺取农业全面大丰收的过程，从根本上来说是不断地用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，促使人的思想不断革命化的过程。毛主席教导我们说：“……代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量”。今年农业全面大丰收，正是亿万农民群众和农村革命干部，在滚滚向前的无产阶级文化大革命中更加奋发地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切、指导一切、改造一切、推动一切的结果。许多群众和干部在回顾一年来的斗争实践时都说：农业丰收来源于思想革命化，思想革命化来源于活学活用毛主席著作。这种感受是非常真切和深刻的。
    今年春天，当无产阶级文化大革命正以排山倒海之势迅猛异常地向前发展，农村备耕工作正处于紧张阶段的时候，党内一小撮走资派，同地、富、反、坏、右分子勾结起来，大刮反革命经济主义黑风，大放资本主义毒素，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命和春耕生产。面对这种情况，广大农民群众和农村革命干部重温了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，学习了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，他们获得了巨大的力量，毅然地向阶级敌人展开了英勇的反击，坚决地把革命和生产两副重担肩负起来，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋。之后，他们又紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，满怀激情地投入到革命大批判的斗争中去，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人猛烈开火，愤怒地揭发和批判中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“保存富农经济”等反革命修正主义谬论。在革命大批判的过程中，人们带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，特别是活学活用“老三篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大破修正主义，大立毛泽东思想，大搞思想革命化。通过革命大批判和大学习，广大农民群众和农村革命干部的社会主义觉悟不断提高，决心排除万难，去争取革命、生产的双胜利。
    为了夺取农业全面大丰收，无论是南方地区或是北方地区，都进行了大规模的农田基本建设。各地在改革生产技术方面也作了巨大的努力。一年来，各种农业机械、排灌设备、化学肥料和农药等的供应和购置量，都比去年有不同程度的增长。所有这些，对于今年农业的全面大丰收都起了重大的作用。
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”今年我国农业的全面丰收，同中国人民解放军的大力支援是分不开的。从春天开始，各地人民解放军就遵照毛主席的指示，派出成千成万的毛泽东思想宣传队，奔赴各地农村，大力宣传毛泽东思想，协助各地农民群众和农村革命干部，贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。广大解放军指战员发扬了既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队的光荣传统，带头活学活用毛主席著作，坚持同贫下中农和革命干部并肩战斗，为夺取革命、生产双胜利作出了巨大的贡献。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”中指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”一年来，随着无产阶级文化大革命更广泛、更深入地向前发展，我国农业生产出现了前所未有的全面大丰收的可喜局面，雄辩地证明这一论断是一个伟大的真理。对我国无产阶级文化大革命恨得要死、怕得要命的美帝、苏修和各国反动派，曾不断地胡说什么无产阶级文化大革命会“破坏”工农业生产，会把我国国民经济“搞乱”。历史的事实无情地宣告了这些“预言家”们的彻底破产。
    目前，在我国广大农村中，革命烈火熊熊，生产高潮滚滚，形势一派大好，越来越好。亿万农民群众和农村革命干部，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“要斗私，批修”的号召，掀起了斗私批修的新高潮。他们决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为夺取明年更大、更全面的农业丰收而英勇斗争。
