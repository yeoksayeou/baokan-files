The revolutionary criticism movement in rural Hubei is surging forward, developing from county, commune, and production brigade levels to production teams, and from denunciation, exposure, and accusation meetings to thematic criticism.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 9th: Our correspondent's commentary: "In the frost of a thousand trees, red is brilliant; the wrath of the heavenly soldiers surges to the heavens." A movement to criticize and repudiate the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in rural areas is like the surging waves of the Yangtze River, deeply unfolding in Hubei's rural areas.

From the banks of the Yangtze River to the shores of the Han River, from towns to remote mountain villages, everywhere is a battlefield for fiercely exposing, fiercely criticizing, and thoroughly beating the fallen dog, the Chinese Khrushchev. Broad masses of revolutionary peasants are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, bombarding the Chinese Khrushchev with ten thousand cannons, forming a vast ocean of people's war. Currently, the revolutionary criticism movement in the entire province's rural areas has developed from counties, communes, and production brigades to production teams, and from denunciation, exposure, and accusation meetings to thematic exposure and criticism. Broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres resolutely declare that they will definitely carry the struggle between the two roads and two lines in rural areas to the end, turning Hubei's rural areas into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The main force in the countryside that has long been struggling and fighting is the poor peasants," "Without poor peasants, there is no revolution." The vast army of the rural cultural revolution, with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force, has always directed the spearhead of struggle at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and their agents. This is an important sign of the vigorous development of the revolutionary criticism movement in Hubei's rural areas.

The Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary two-faced character Tao Zhu's henchman Wang Renzhong have been vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in Hubei, attempting to restore capitalism. Over the past eighteen years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province's rural areas have followed the great helmsman Chairman Mao, overcome evil winds and mists, and insisted on the socialist road. Today, they are even more closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, extensively carrying out the activities of "three bitter recounts and three sweet reflections," concentrating targets and firepower, bombarding the Chinese Khrushchev with ten thousand cannons. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants use ironclad facts to recount the bitterness of the old society, reflect on the sweetness of the new society, and fiercely open fire on the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "exploitation is meritorious" and "four freedoms"; recount the bitterness of the individual farming road, reflect on the sweetness of people's communes, and fiercely open fire on the counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in strangling agricultural cooperation and spreading the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract"; recount the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line, reflect on the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fiercely open fire on the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the theory of "class struggle extinction" and "striking a large area and protecting a small number." They recall the past, look at today, and love Chairman Mao, socialism, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even more; they hate the Chinese Khrushchev, capitalism, and the bourgeois reactionary line even more.

The great leader Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism is like a spring thunder, spreading throughout Hubei's vast rural areas. Various places have extensively held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Broad masses of commune members, cadres, and militia actively participate in the study, powerfully promoting the rural revolutionary criticism movement.

Many people's communes and production brigades in Huanggang, Jingzhou, Xiangyang, Dongfeng, and other regions have already held five or six sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. These study classes are currently developing to production teams. These study classes hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent in Hubei, Wang Renzhong, in rural areas, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois "self," and thoroughly establishing the proletarian "public." Broad masses of commune members, cadres, and militia praise that the study classes can train and organize the rural revolutionary criticism forces, ensuring that the rural revolutionary criticism deepens step by step and achieves a thorough victory in the rural cultural revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without correct political views, it is like having no soul." Another prominent feature of the revolutionary criticism movement in Hubei's vast rural areas is to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to command the revolutionary criticism, combining the extensive study of Chairman Mao's works with the extensive criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev, combining the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform in one's own region and unit, thoroughly smashing the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and thoroughly upholding the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary criticism movement in many places in Hubei's rural areas adopts the tactic of annihilation, conducting thematic criticism. That is, within a certain period, studying one aspect of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant expositions, criticizing one aspect of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies, thoroughly purging the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev, and further establishing Chairman Mao's revolutionary views. In this way, it can ensure, in accordance with the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, to "study with problems, actively learn and apply, combine learning with use, learn what is urgently needed first, see immediate results, and work hard on the 'use'."

    紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署　口诛笔伐中国赫鲁晓夫
    湖北农村革命大批判运动滚滚向前
    运动已由县社大队发展到生产队，由声讨揭发控诉会发展到专题批判
    据新华社武汉九日电　本社记者述评：“万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉。”一场围剿中国赫鲁晓夫在农村方面的反革命修正主义路线的革命大批判运动，有如滚滚东流的长江巨浪，正在湖北农村深入展开。
    从长江两岸到汉水之滨，从城镇到偏僻的山村，到处都摆开了狠揭、猛批、痛打落水狗中国赫鲁晓夫的战场。广大革命农民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，万炮齐轰中国赫鲁晓夫，形成了“人民战争”的汪洋大海。目前，全省农村革命大批判运动已经由县、社、大队发展到生产队，由声讨揭发控诉会发展到专题揭发批判。广大贫下中农和革命干部坚决表示，一定要把农村两条道路、两条路线的斗争进行到底，把湖北农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    毛主席教导我们说：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农”，“没有贫农，便没有革命。”以广大贫下中农为主体的浩浩荡荡的农村文化革命大军，始终把斗争矛头对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派和他们的代理人，这是湖北农村革命大批判运动蓬勃发展的一个重要标志。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸的心腹王任重在湖北大力推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义。十八年来，全省农村广大贫下中农，紧跟伟大舵手毛主席，战胜妖风迷雾，坚持了社会主义的道路。今天，他们更加紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，通过广泛开展“三诉苦、三思甜”的活动，集中目标，集中火力，万炮齐轰中国赫鲁晓夫。广大贫下中农用铁的事实，忆诉旧社会的苦，思比新社会的甜，向中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“剥削有功”、“四大自由”等反革命修正主义谬论猛烈开火；忆诉单干道路的苦，思比人民公社化的甜，向中国赫鲁晓夫扼杀农业合作化、刮起“三自一包”黑风的反革命修正主义罪行猛烈开火；忆诉资产阶级反动路线的苦，思比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜，向中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“打击一大片，保护一小撮”等反革命修正主义黑货猛烈开火。他们忆过去，看今天，更加无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱社会主义，无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；更加无比憎恨中国赫鲁晓夫，无比憎恨资本主义，无比憎恨资产阶级反动路线。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出的要斗私，批修的伟大战斗号令，象一声春雷，传遍了湖北广大农村。各地普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班。广大社员、干部和民兵积极参加学习，有力地推动了农村革命大批判运动。
    黄冈、荆州、襄阳、东风等地区的许多人民公社和生产大队，已经举办五、六期毛泽东思想学习班。这些学习班目前正在向生产队发展。这些学习班高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖北代理人王任重在农村方面的反革命修正主义路线，大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字。广大社员、干部和民兵赞扬说，学习班能够训练、组织农村革命大批判的队伍，保证农村革命大批判步步深入，夺取农村文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    毛主席教导我们说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”湖北广大农村革命大批判运动的又一个鲜明特点是，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅革命大批判，把毛主席著作的大学习同对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判结合起来，把革命大批判和本地区、本单位的斗批改结合起来，大破特破资产阶级反动路线，大立特立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    湖北农村许多地方的革命大批判运动，采取了打歼灭战的方针，进行专题批判。即在一段时间内，学习伟大领袖毛主席一个方面的英明论述，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个方面的反动谬论，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，进一步树立毛主席的革命观点。这样，就能够保证遵照伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志的指示，做到“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”
