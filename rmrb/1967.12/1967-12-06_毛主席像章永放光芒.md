There is a touching story in a factory in Burma: A female worker received a Chairman Mao badge, and she felt very happy. She always wore the Chairman Mao badge neatly on her chest and carefully stored it away whenever she changed clothes. One morning, the female worker was rushing to work, and in her haste, she couldn't find the Chairman Mao badge and felt very anxious. Seeing his daughter's love for Chairman Mao, her father comforted her, saying, "Go to work! I will definitely find it for you!" The old man searched for over three hours and finally found the Chairman Mao badge. Then, he walked more than ten miles to the factory to deliver the Chairman Mao badge to his daughter. The female worker, holding the Chairman Mao badge, was overjoyed and immediately wore it. She said, "I love Chairman Mao's badge the most. I will let Chairman Mao's badge forever shine brightly on my chest."

    毛主席像章永放光芒
    在缅甸某工厂有这样一个动人的故事：一位女工得到一枚毛主席像章，她感到很幸福，一直把毛主席像章端端正正地戴在胸前，每次换衣服的时候，总是把毛主席像章珍藏起来。一天早上，这位女工赶着要上班，因为时间紧迫，一时没能找到毛主席像章，心情很焦急。父亲见女儿这样热爱毛主席，便安慰她说：“你上班去吧！我一定为你找！”她父亲一直找了三个多钟头，终于把毛主席像章找到了。接着这位老人走了十多里路，赶到工厂去，把毛主席像章送给他的女儿。这位女工手捧毛主席像章，高兴极了，立即戴起来。她说：“我最爱毛主席像章，我要让毛主席的像章永远在我胸前放射灿烂的光芒。”
