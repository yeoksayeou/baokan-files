The puppet soldiers in South Vietnam lack fighting spirit and are riddled with corruption. Many desert.

In the first nine months of this year, nearly three thousand soldiers deserted from the puppet armies in the provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien in South Vietnam. In the western region of South Vietnam, in the provinces of Long Khanh and Phuoc Tuy, over one thousand two hundred soldiers deserted in July and August alone. In many places, puppet soldiers deserted en masse. The Suoi Da military training base had an entire battalion of puppet soldiers reduced to just one platoon and seven American "advisors" due to mass desertions.

Carrying sacks to fight.

Due to the layers of embezzlement and misappropriation of military funds by puppet military officers, puppet soldiers often go hungry. Therefore, when some puppet military units go on "sweeping" operations, they always prepare large quantities of empty sacks in advance. Upon reaching the "sweeping" area, they carry sacks with one hand while holding guns with the other, stealing chickens, burglarizing homes, and looting. This has become a habit of the South Vietnamese puppet army.

Specializing in slavery.

In the central highlands of South Vietnam, in Da Lat, an entire regiment of puppet soldiers does not fight but instead focuses on brewing beer, washing clothes, and providing prostitutes for the American invaders. A South Vietnamese puppet commando unit near Pleiku also performs similar tasks.

　　南越傀儡军士无斗志腐败不堪
　　大量开小差
    越南南方广治和承天两省伪军，在今年头九个月中，有近三千人逃跑。南部西区的龙川、朱笃两省伪军在七、八两月份里共有一千二百多人逃跑。不少地方的伪军士兵纷纷集体开小差。苏州军事训练基地有一营伪军因为士兵大量逃跑，结果只剩下一个排和七名美国“顾问”。
    打仗背麻袋
　　由于伪军军官层层贪污和侵吞军饷，伪军士兵经常“肚子挨饿”。于是，一些伪军部队出去“扫荡”时，总是预先准备了大量空麻袋。到了“扫荡”区，他们一手拿着枪，一手背着麻袋，偷鸡摸狗，打家劫舍。这已经成为南越伪军的一种“习惯”。
    专职当奴隶
    在南越中部高原的德都，有一个团的伪军不打仗，专门集中力量给美国侵略军搞啤酒、洗衣服和供应妓女。在波来古附近的一支南越伪军突击队，也干着同样的差使。
