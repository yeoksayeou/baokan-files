If one has made mistakes, one must engage in self-criticism. One should not always assume one is right, as if the truth is always in one's hands. One should not always think that only one is capable, while others are not, as if the world would stop without one.

The revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, which is based on Marxism-Leninism, has become a great motivation for running Mao Zedong Thought study classes well. Revolutionary masses and cadres across the country have decided to take class struggle and criticism of revisionism as the key, to launch a larger-scale mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and to strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 23rd, the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on establishing a revolutionary learning style based on Marxism-Leninism are becoming a powerful force driving the running of Mao Zedong Thought study classes across the country. Revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary cadres in various places have seriously studied the important editorial "Efforts Must Be Made to Run Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes Well" published in the People's Daily. They are filled with deep feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and are determined to establish the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, to combine learning with application, to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights, and to strive for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Acting Swiftly, Combining Learning with Application, Seeing Immediate Results

Representatives from various revolutionary worker organizations in Wuhan who are studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes have seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions and latest directives. They have acted swiftly, combined learning with application, and seen immediate results, removing ideological obstacles to achieving revolutionary great unity. Today, they have reached an agreement to establish the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan City Revolutionary Workers' Congress.

Before this, representatives from various revolutionary worker organizations in Wuhan had been discussing in the study classes for some time how to achieve revolutionary great unity throughout the city. On the 22nd, the comrades in the study class placed a radio on the meeting table and seriously listened to the editorial of the People's Daily that day, continuing to discuss how to solve specific issues related to achieving revolutionary great unity. During the discussion, the comrades repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions and latest directives. They studied for a whole day and then discussed throughout the night. The more they studied, the more they felt that Chairman Mao's directives were brilliant and great. They not only did not vie for positions but also let others take the positions; they not only did not blame each other but also voluntarily engaged in sincere self-criticism in front of each other.

Representatives from revolutionary mass organizations in seven units, including Zhengzhou Railway North Station and Zhengzhou Locomotive North Section, have, through studying Chairman Mao's latest directives and thorough consultation, recently established revolutionary great unity committees in these seven units. The representatives from the two factions of mass organizations studying in the study classes in these seven units have, after studying the editorial of the People's Daily, further examined their work in the previous period in light of Chairman Mao's latest directives. When they found that some aspects of Chairman Mao's directives were not fully implemented, they immediately sent people back to their respective units to further implement them. They said, whether or not Chairman Mao's directives can be followed to the letter is a matter of attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought. We will not be a revolutionary faction that only talks but does not act. To achieve a combination of learning and application, we must grasp the essence of loyalty.

Revolutionary masses and cadres in various places have emphasized that to establish the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao and to achieve a combination of learning and application, the most fundamental thing is to uphold the spirit of loyalty, to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Revolutionary masses in the capital say that whether or not one applies what one has learned from Chairman Mao's works, whether or not one implements Chairman Mao's latest directives, is the mark that distinguishes a genuine revolutionary faction from a faction that only talks. Revolutionary masses and cadres of the Jinan Locomotive Factory, in conjunction with studying the editorial of the People's Daily, summarized the experience of the previous several study classes in their factory. They deeply felt that to truly achieve a combination of learning and application and to run the study classes well, we must be like Comrade Li Wenzhong, fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and sacrificing for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while dead. We support what Chairman Mao supports, we implement what Chairman Mao directs, and we advance when Chairman Mao waves his hand. The Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Dyeing and Chemical Factory No. 8 has already held nineteen sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, most of which were run quite well. The workers, with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the guideline, brought problems to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, achieving immediate results. The responsible comrades of the factory revolutionary committee said that being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, doing what Chairman Mao says, is the most fundamental experience we have gained in running Mao Zedong Thought study classes well.

	To Achieve a Combination of Learning and Application, One Must Struggle Against Selfishness

During the study of the editorial of the People's Daily, revolutionary masses and cadres in many places have particularly emphasized that only by struggling against selfishness and establishing public spirit can one establish the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao and achieve a combination of learning and application, acting swiftly and seeing immediate results.

Revolutionary masses and cadres of the Guangzhou Water Supply Company have particularly deep feelings in this regard. Recently, through holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes at all levels, they have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works and implemented Chairman Mao's latest directives, broken away from selfishness, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, and further consolidated and developed revolutionary great unity in terms of ideology. In the study classes, revolutionary workers linked the actual situation, with a revolutionary spirit of "fighting to the death," fearlessly and shamelessly exposing the selfish thoughts deep in their souls, even revealing past "secrets" that were previously considered "top secret." Some responsible comrades of revolutionary mass organizations bravely exposed that they had once colluded with outside units to smash two headquarters of the opposing side. Everyone said that with selfishness, long-term "internal wars" would make it impossible to distinguish between enemies and friends; with selfishness, it would be easy to be used by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and bad elements; with selfishness, one would put the interests of small groups above everything else. In a word, with selfishness, it would be impossible to act swiftly in response to Chairman Mao's directives, and it would be impossible to achieve a combination of learning and application and see immediate results.

A responsible comrade of a revolutionary mass organization in Jiangxi Heng Lake Reclamation Farm was once labeled a "counter-revolutionary" by a cadre who had implemented the capitalist reactionary line in the early days of the Cultural Revolution. He, with personal grudges, refused to agree that the cadre should stand up and revolutionize. After participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, he seriously used Chairman Mao's "Old Five Articles" and latest directives to examine and criticize himself, exposing his selfish thoughts and engaging in self-criticism. He voluntarily wrote a letter to the cadre, encouraging the cadre to correct mistakes and stand up to revolutionize. This responsible comrade of the revolutionary mass organization said that only by constantly breaking away from selfishness and establishing public spirit can one implement Chairman Mao's directives without any deviation.

	Study in Struggle, Apply in Struggle,
	Follow Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment

Revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary cadres in various places have emphasized that only by seriously establishing the revolutionary learning style personally advocated by Chairman Mao and by running Mao Zedong Thought study classes well can one better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Through running Mao Zedong Thought study classes extensively, secondary schools in the capital have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works extensively, carried out self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, developed and consolidated revolutionary great unity, and achieved revolutionary three-in-one combination in most schools. Currently, revolutionary teachers and students in various middle schools are extensively studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution, launching a high tide of educational revolution. Many revolutionary teachers and students in middle schools have deeply felt that all the victories they have achieved are the results of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and firmly implementing Chairman Mao's directives. In the future, we must better combine learning with application, focus on application, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to make revolution.

So far, the Red Star Tractor Factory in Guizhou has held nine study classes, achieving relatively good results. The revolutionary masses in this factory said that theory must be linked with practice, and learning must be combined with application. First of all, it must be linked with the actual struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, with the actual struggle of revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and the rectification of one's own unit. One must study in struggle and apply in struggle, so as to better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and effectively promote the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary masses participating in the Qinghuatan Street study class in Changsha have repeatedly studied the editorial of the People's Daily, examined and checked themselves, and found the gaps. They are determined to better study in struggle and apply in struggle, to establish a revolutionary learning style, to run the study classes better, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    自己有了错误，要作自我批评。不要总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里。不要总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了。			毛泽东
    毛主席倡导的马列主义革命好学风成为办好毛泽东思想学习班巨大动力
    各地革命群众和革命干部决心以斗私批修为纲，掀起更大规模的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利
    据新华社二十三日讯　伟大领袖毛主席关于建立马克思列宁主义的革命好学风的教导，正在成为推动全国办好毛泽东思想学习班的强大力量。各地广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，认真学习了《人民日报》的重要社论《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》，他们满怀无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚感情，决心建立起毛主席倡导的革命好学风，学用结合，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗！
   	闻风而动，学用结合，立竿见影
    在毛泽东思想学习班学习的武汉市各革命工人组织负责人，认真学习毛主席的教导和最新指示，闻风而动，学用结合，立竿见影，扫除实现革命大联合的思想障碍，今天达成了建立武汉市革命工人代表大会临时委员会的协议。
    在这以前，武汉市各革命工人组织的负责人，就如何实现全市工人革命大联合的问题，已经在学习班里进行了一段时间的酝酿和协商。二十二日，学习班的同志们把收音机放在会议桌上，认真收听《人民日报》当天的社论，继续讨论怎样解决实现革命大联合的具体问题。讨论中，同志们一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席的教导和最新指示。他们整整学习了一天，接着又讨论了一个通宵。同志们越学越体会到毛主席的指示英明伟大。他们不仅不争席位，而且相互让席位；不仅不互相指责，而且各自主动在对方面前做诚恳的自我批评。
    郑州铁路北站、郑州机务北段等七个单位的革命群众组织负责人，通过学习毛主席的最新指示，经过充分协商，不久前在这七个单位分别成立了革命大联合委员会。这七个单位正在学习班学习的两派群众组织负责人，学习了《人民日报》社论以后，又对照毛主席的最新指示，进一步检查了前一段的工作。当他们发现有些地方对毛主席的指示执行得还不彻底时，马上共同派人回本单位进一步贯彻。他们说，对毛主席的指示能不能句句照办，这是对毛泽东思想的态度问题，我们决不做学了不用、说了不做的口头革命派。要做到学用结合，必须狠抓一个忠字
    各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部着重指出，要建立起毛主席倡导的革命好学风，做到学用结合，学了就用，最根本的是要树立起一个忠字，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    首都的革命群众说，学了毛主席著作，用，还是不用；学了毛主席的最新指示，贯彻，还是不贯彻，这是区别真正革命派和口头革命派的标志。济南机车工厂的革命群众和革命干部，结合学习《人民日报》社论，总结了本厂前几期学习班的经验。他们深有体会地说，要真正做到学用结合，办好学习班，我们就要象李文忠同志那样，生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身，毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。上海染化八厂革命委员会已经举办的十九期毛泽东思想学习班，大部分办得比较好。职工们以毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为指针，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，收到了立竿见影的效果。厂革委会的负责人说，无限忠于毛主席，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，这是我们办好毛泽东思想学习班最根本的一条体会。
   	要做到学用结合，必须狠斗私字
    在学习《人民日报》社论的过程中，许多地方的革命群众和革命干部特别强调，只有狠斗私字，大立公字，才能建立起毛主席倡导的革命好学风，做到对毛主席的一切指示闻风而动，学用结合，立竿见影。
    广州人民供水公司的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在这方面体会特别深刻。这个公司最近通过层层大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作和贯彻毛主席的最新指示，破私立公，克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，从思想上进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合。在学习班中，革命职工联系实际，以刺刀见红的革命精神，不怕痛、不怕丑，亮出了灵魂深处的私心杂念，甚至连过去被认为是“绝密”的事情也都全盘托出。有的革命群众组织的负责人，把他自己曾经串通外单位砸了对方两个总部的“绝密”，勇敢地亮了出来。大家说，有了私字，长期打“内战”，就分不清敌我友；有了私字，就容易被党内一小撮走资派和坏人利用；有了私字，就会把小团体利益看得高于一切。一句话，有了私字，就不可能做到对毛主席的指示闻风而动，就不可能学用结合，立竿见影。
    江西恒湖垦殖场一位革命群众组织的负责人，在文化大革命初期，曾被执行过资产阶级反动路线的一个干部打成“反革命”。他带着个人情绪，硬是不同意那个干部站出来革命。参加毛泽东思想学习班以后，他认真地用毛主席的“老五篇”和最新指示来对照检查自己，亮出了自己的私心，作了自我批评。他主动给那个干部写信，鼓励那个干部改正错误，站起来革命。这位革命群众组织负责人说，只有时时、事事破私立公，才能不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的一切指示。
      在斗争中学，在斗争中用，
  紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部强调指出，只有认真建立毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，才能更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    首都中等学校通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，大学大用毛主席著作，开展斗私批修，发展和巩固革命的大联合，绝大部分学校实现了革命的三结合。目前，各中学革命师生正在大学大用毛主席的教育革命思想，掀起教育革命的高潮。许多中学的革命师生深有体会地说，我们取得的一切胜利，都是活学活用毛主席著作，坚决执行毛主席指示的结果。今后，我们一定要更好地学用结合，在用字上狠下功夫，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署闹革命。
    贵州红星拖拉机厂到目前为止已经办过九期学习班，取得了较好的效果。这个厂的革命群众说，理论联系实际，学用结合，首先要联系两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，联系革命大批判、革命大联合、革命三结合和本单位斗批改的实际，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，这样才能更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，有效地推进无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展。
    参加长沙市清水塘街道学习班学习的革命群众，反复学习《人民日报》社论，对照检查，找出差距。他们决心更好地在斗争中学，在斗争中用，建立革命好学风，把学习班办得更好，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
