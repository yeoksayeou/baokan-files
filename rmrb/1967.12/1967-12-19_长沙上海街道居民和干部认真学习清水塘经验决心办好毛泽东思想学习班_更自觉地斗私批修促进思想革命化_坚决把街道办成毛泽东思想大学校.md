Residents and cadres of Changsha Shanghai Street are seriously studying the Qing Shui Tang experience and resolving to hold good Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They are more consciously fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism to promote the revolutionization of thought and resolutely turn the street into a Mao Zedong Thought school.

The experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Qing Shui Tang Street in Changsha City has been published, and residents and revolutionary masses from factories and rural areas across the city have seriously studied and discussed it. Everyone agrees that the study classes in Qing Shui Tang Street are excellent. They have done a good job of ideological work for every individual, greatly popularizing the great Mao Zedong Thought. We must ensure that this good experience blooms and bears fruit across the city.

The preparatory committee of the Changsha City Revolutionary Committee has actively promoted the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Qing Shui Tang Street, making such classes sprout up like bamboo shoots after a rainstorm across the city. The preparatory committee and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations in various streets have all expressed their determination to vigorously promote the Qing Shui Tang experience and push the holding of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in streets to a new high.

After studying this experience, leaders of the revolutionary mass organization in Dongmao Street, Dong District, Changsha City, felt that the ideological and political work in Qing Shui Tang Street was more detailed than theirs. They expressed that in the future, they would be more patient in mobilizing the masses, doing a good job of ideological and political work for the masses, helping the masses solve specific difficulties, and ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to study Mao Zedong Thought.

After studying the Qing Shui Tang experience, the leaders of the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Changsha Automobile Electrical Appliance Factory were deeply moved. They believed that residents in the streets have various specific difficulties, yet the Mao Zedong Thought study classes are held so well. The factory conditions are better, so the Mao Zedong Thought study classes should be held even better. Students from Shaoshan Road People's Commune, who are participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class for the revolutionary masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Changsha City, compared their own study class with Qing Shui Tang and felt that the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in Qing Shui Tang Street is held high, and the masses are fully mobilized. They expressed their determination to do a more detailed job of ideological and political work, reaching every household, so that men, women, old, and young can all have the opportunity to study.

After hearing the news of their study classes being broadcast nationwide, the revolutionary masses and the support-left troops in Qing Shui Tang Street, where this experience was created, were all elated and excited, spreading the news to each other, and repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!" On the afternoon of the 16th, more than a thousand representatives from the street, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, holding up Chairman Mao's quotations, drumming and gonging, went to the preparatory committee of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees and the 69000 unit of the People's Liberation Army to report the good news. Many active members of the street expressed that they would better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and run the study classes better.

At the symposium on holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes across the province, convened by the preparatory committee of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the 69000 unit of the People's Liberation Army, representatives from various regions seriously studied the Qing Shui Tang experience. The representatives excitedly said that the Qing Shui Tang experience solves our problems. We will definitely promote it seriously upon returning and run the study classes well.

The experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes by residents of Qing Shui Tang Street in Changsha City has greatly inspired the broad masses of residents and revolutionary cadres in the lanes and alleys of Shanghai. In the past few days, they have seriously studied, linked it with reality, summarized experiences, and resolved to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, to hold more, more lively, and better study classes in the lanes and alleys, to achieve new levels, and to turn the lanes and alleys into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Recently, the broad masses of residents and revolutionary cadres in the lanes and alleys of Shanghai have generally started Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The study classes, based on the characteristics of the lanes and alleys with many people, wide coverage, and different objects, have adopted various forms, achieving the principle of "the masses themselves organize, teach, learn, and solve problems," making them lively and vibrant, and presenting many touching examples such as husbands and wives studying together, mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law studying together, and holding family criticism meetings at night after returning home. The broad masses of residents and cadres in the lanes and alleys, after studying the Qing Shui Tang experience, are even more confident in running the study classes better.

Many residents and revolutionary cadres in the lanes and alleys said after studying the Qing Shui Tang experience that the study classes held in Qing Shui Tang Street are a good example for us to learn from. They deeply felt from their life practice that the lanes and alleys and families are the basic cells of social organizations. For a long time, the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism has been deep. In every movement, the lanes and alleys and families often become blind spots. This time, in the great proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought shines on the lanes and alleys, entering every revolutionary resident's family. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many revolutionary residents expressed that they must better listen to Chairman Mao's words, more consciously fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, thoroughly eliminate the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, and let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought firmly occupy this important position in the lanes and alleys and families.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes held in Qing Shui Tang Street in Changsha City have provided experience and pointed out the direction for further running the study classes in the lanes and alleys. Many residents and cadres in the lanes and alleys of Shanghai, during the study, adopted the method of linking with reality, comparing with the advanced, finding the gap, and summarizing experiences. Through the study, they generally felt that the Qing Shui Tang experience is good in detailed ideological work, reaching every household and implementing it for every individual; it is good in cultivating Mao Zedong Thought propagandists according to the characteristics of the residents and integrating the cultivation of cadres and relying on forces into one, leading the residents to universally study, and implementing Chairman Mao's mass line; it is good in starting from class education, guiding everyone to recall and compare, which is completely in line with the characteristics of the lanes and alleys. They resolved to turn the study and discussion into practical actions and truly master the Qing Shui Tang experience.

In the support-agriculture team of the certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Fengtai District, Beijing, together with the commune members, they held family criticism meetings, through the comparison of past and present, severely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev, greatly raising the class consciousness of the commune members.
