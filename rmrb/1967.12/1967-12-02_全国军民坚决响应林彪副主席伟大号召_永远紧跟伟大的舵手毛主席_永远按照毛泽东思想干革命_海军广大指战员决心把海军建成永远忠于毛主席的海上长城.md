The entire nation's military and civilians resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's great call. They will forever follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao and forever carry out the revolution according to Mao Zedong Thought. The broad ranks of naval personnel are determined to build the navy into an ever-loyal-to-Chairman-Mao sea wall.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on December 1st, "The vast sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The joyous news of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the intimate comrade-in-arms of the great leader Chairman Mao, writing the inscription for the first conference of naval personnel who have actively studied Chairman Mao's works, has stirred up waves of excitement across the country. Everywhere, people are singing songs of praise for the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Billions of revolutionary masses sing "The East Is Red" and "The vast sea voyage relies on the helmsman" thousands of times, shouting thousands of times, "Long live the great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!" The revolutionary masses in various places, filled with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, unanimously declare that they will learn from Vice Chairman Lin's shining example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao, forever carrying out the revolution according to Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary workers, peasants, cadres, and Red Guards of the capital, who are most loyal to Chairman Mao, enthusiastically acclaim Vice Chairman Lin Biao's inscription. The revolutionary masses of the capital excitedly point out that the sixteen golden words personally written by Vice Chairman Lin are the most concentrated and complete expression of the people of the entire nation and the revolutionary people of the whole world's lofty faith in the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The victory of the Chinese revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought; the victory of the world revolution still relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Knitting Factory said, "The socialist ship of seven hundred million Chinese people cannot do without the great helmsman Chairman Mao for a single moment, cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and more firmly sail along the course indicated by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, breaking waves and forging ahead."

When Vice Chairman Lin's inscription reached Shanghai, the broad revolutionary masses, cadres, and revolutionary Red Guards enthusiastically acclaimed it, unanimously believing it to be a great encouragement to the entire Party, the people of the entire nation, and the revolutionary people of the world. The steel workers of Shanghai said, "Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people, and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the victory of the Chinese revolution and the fundamental guarantee for the complete victory of the world revolution." The responsible person of the Shanghai Higher Education Red Guards' Association, filled with revolutionary passion, pointed out, "Every achievement, every victory, and every progress of ours, which one is not personally guided by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, which one is not achieved by the boundless Mao Zedong Thought! We must seriously study, deeply understand, resolutely implement, and thoroughly carry out the great call of Vice Commander Lin, and study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, reform our thoughts for a lifetime."

The broad ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses in Shandong, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and other places, have been studying and discussing Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, enthusiastically praising the great achievements of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, specially discussing the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and specially discussing the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. More than two thousand representatives participating in the Shandong Province's meeting to thoroughly criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong held an excited discussion meeting. They said, "The vast sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the helmsman is Chairman Mao. At every critical moment in the Chinese revolution, it is Chairman Mao who steers the ship and points out the direction, leading the billion people of the nation from victory to victory." The revolutionary ranks of the Shanxi Red Weaving Factory were extremely moved and said, "The brightness of the moon, stars, and sun is not as bright as Mao Zedong Thought; the depth of the ocean and rivers is not as deep as Chairman Mao's kindness. We must actively and seriously study Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end." The peasants of the Dazhuang Production Brigade of Changshan Commune in Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, said, "Chairman Mao is our best guide, and Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle peasants. We resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's call, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and turn the countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school."

The joyous news reached Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Xinjiang, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, and the broad ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and Red Guards were extremely excited. At the Tianjin Municipal Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, and High School Red Guards' Congress, the proletarian revolutionaries and Red Guards said, "The vast sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought, this is an absolute truth. We must follow Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for a lifetime."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on December 1st, the inscription by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the intimate comrade-in-arms of our great leader Chairman Mao, for the first conference of naval personnel who have actively studied Chairman Mao's works, "The vast sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," has greatly inspired the broad ranks of the People's Liberation Army personnel. They, with indescribable excitement, specially discussed the great achievements of the great helmsman Chairman Mao and the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad ranks of personnel unanimously declared that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for all our victories, and we must take Vice Chairman Lin as an example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The broad ranks of personnel unanimously pointed out that Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is not only the glory of the navy but also the glory of the entire army and the people of the nation; it is not only the greatest concern, encouragement, motivation, and education for the navy but also the greatest concern, encouragement, motivation, and education for the entire army and the people of the nation. The personnel of the "Iron Second Company," which Vice Chairman Lin once served as the company commander, said, "Vice Chairman Lin's inscription speaks the words in our hearts. We must thoroughly bury the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and we must rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." The personnel attending the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Qingdao garrison of a certain unit pointed out that Vice Chairman Lin's inscription is a mobilization order, guiding us to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage; it is a call to arms, calling on us to turn the entire army and the nation into a red Mao Zedong Thought school with the people of the nation; it is a battle cry, commanding us to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, stride forward, break waves, and better complete the glorious mission entrusted by the times.

When the broad ranks of personnel studied and discussed Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, they linked it with the history of the development and growth of our Party and army, linked it with the glorious victories of the Cultural Revolution in the past year, and linked it with the unprecedentedly good situation at home and abroad. They specially praised the great leader Chairman Mao, specially praised the great Mao Zedong Thought, and specially praised Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many veteran Red Army soldiers, filled with deep emotions, recalled the glorious course of following the great leader Chairman Mao from victory to victory in the south and north; many heroes with outstanding achievements recalled their battle experiences of winning with Mao Zedong Thought; many personnel who made outstanding achievements in the Cultural Revolution recalled the process of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and doing a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work. They said excitedly, "The vast sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," is a great truth, an eternal truth, the fundamental of our army's construction, the fundamental of our country's revolution, and the fundamental of the world revolution. In the battle on August 21st this year, where two A-6 type aircraft of the U.S. imperialists were shot down, Han Ruizhi, who was awarded the first-class merit citation, said: "Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts! Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have achieved one great victory after another. We must shout a thousand times and ten thousand times, 'The vast sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.'" The personnel of the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the Lanzhou Garrison, facing Chairman Mao's portrait, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts illuminate the mountains and rivers of the motherland, illuminate the path of the world's revolutionary people, and illuminate the red hearts of revolutionary soldiers. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the treasure of the revolution, the soul of life, the power of struggle, and the lighthouse of progress. We cannot do without it for a single moment, and at every critical moment of struggle, it is always Chairman Mao who points out the direction for us and gives us the power to move forward forever." The personnel of the Fourth Platoon of a certain unit, who made outstanding achievements in the Cultural Revolution, said when studying Vice Chairman Lin's inscription: "Studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is our lifelong glorious mission. We must take Li Wenzhong, the heroic platoon leader, as an example, fight for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought while alive, and die for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought while dead." The personnel of a certain unit executing the "three supports and two militaries" task in the Jingxing Coal Mine, after studying Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, unanimously declared that they would hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, better complete the "three supports and two militaries" task, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on December 1st, on the ten-thousand-li coastal defense line of the motherland, the heroic naval personnel, with indescribable joy, enthusiastically celebrate the inscription by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the intimate comrade-in-arms of the great leader Chairman Mao, for the first conference of naval personnel who have actively studied Chairman Mao's works, "The vast sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The personnel excitedly said: Vice Chairman Lin's sixteen golden words are the fundamental direction of our naval construction and the strongest motivation for us to sail along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, breaking waves and forging ahead.

In the past two days, the ten-thousand-li coastal defense line of the motherland has been filled with excitement. From the Bohai Gulf to Hainan Island, the naval soldiers who day and night guard the coastal defense and guard the Cultural Revolution are immersed in joy and happiness. On the coast of the East China Sea, teams of sailors composed of sailors, beating drums and gongs, went out to the streets to spread the joyous news. On the front line of the South China Sea, the heroic soldiers held meetings and celebrations, shouting the big red slogans of Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, which were pasted all over the ports, airports, and coastal artillery positions. Many leading organs, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, used special cars, wireless telegraphs, and other means to quickly transmit Vice Chairman Lin's inscription to dispersed units on duty.

The broad ranks of personnel, when enthusiastically acclaiming Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, recalled the glorious course of naval construction with revolutionary passion. The deputy commander of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment," a hero of battle, Shuxijin, introduced at the discussion meeting the history of the regiment's growth and strength under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. This unit, as early as the Korean War, relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to defeat the air aces of American imperialism with inferior equipment. Over the past decade, they have never forgotten to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and have achieved one glorious victory after another in the battles to defend the country's airspace. Shuxijin said passionately, "Every victory we have achieved is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought." A certain coastal artillery unit, which Vice Chairman Lin inspected in 1958, followed Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the coastal defense, and guard the motherland, and achieved remarkable results in the construction of revolutionization and militarization. The personnel said with deep feelings when discussing Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, "The vast sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. All our victories come from the great Mao Zedong Thought."

Under the great inspiration of Vice Chairman Lin's inscription, the broad ranks of personnel wrote determination letters, guarantee letters, and letters of congratulations, determined to build the navy into a firm sea wall that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The personnel of a certain garrison unit, which is only a water's distance from the island occupied by the Kuomintang bandits, held a mobilization meeting and firmly declared to put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a higher, earlier, greater, and more important position than everything else. The "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment," the "Sea Pioneers Boat," and many units with outstanding achievements decided to respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism" as the key, accelerate the revolutionization of thought, better complete the glorious tasks of guarding the coastal defense, guarding the Cultural Revolution, and the "three supports and two militaries," and turn the navy into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.
