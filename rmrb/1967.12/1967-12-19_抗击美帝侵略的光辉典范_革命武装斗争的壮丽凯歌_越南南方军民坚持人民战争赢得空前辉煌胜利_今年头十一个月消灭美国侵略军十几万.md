A shining example of resisting U.S. aggression and a triumphant march of revolutionary armed struggle. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam, by persisting in people's war, have achieved unprecedented brilliant victories. In the first eleven months of this year, they have annihilated tens of thousands of U.S. aggressor troops.

Chairman Mao said, "The U.S. imperialists will ultimately be driven out of South Vietnam."

Chairman Mao said:

Xinhua News Agency, December 18 -- Our correspondent's commentary: 1967 is a year in which the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, by persisting in people's war, have achieved unprecedented brilliant victories. With the spirit of "only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards," they dare to struggle and dare to win, striking the 470,000 U.S. aggressor troops, more than 500,000 puppet troops, and more than 50,000 mercenary troops, making the so-called "powerful" U.S. imperialists deeply mired in an unprecedented passive situation on the South Vietnamese battlefield, facing imminent doom.

Throughout the year, victory reports have been frequent in various parts of South Vietnam. From the northern Quang Tri--Thua Thien to the southern Cape St. Jacques, from coastal areas to the central highlands, even in the U.S. puppet stronghold of Saigon, the sounds of guns and cannons of the people's liberation armed forces striking the enemy have been heard everywhere. The 14 million heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam, with the spirit of decisive battle and victory, have united and fought, fully unleashing the boundless power of people's war, defeating the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs' repeated frenzied counterattacks. According to incomplete statistics, in the first eleven months of this year alone, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have annihilated tens of thousands of U.S. aggressor troops. This far exceeds the number of U.S. troops increased in South Vietnam this year, which is about 80,000. This fully shows that the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have achieved an unprecedented favorable situation.

The military and civilian people of South Vietnam are highly proactive, and the U.S. aggressors are beaten everywhere.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "Initiative is the freedom of the army. Once the army loses its initiative and is forced into a passive position, this army will not be free and will face the danger of being annihilated or defeated." The situation over the past year shows that the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have more firmly grasped the initiative on the battlefield; while the U.S. aggressor troops are beaten everywhere and have lost their initiative.

Just as 1967 began, when the U.S. aggressors launched their so-called "second dry season offensive," the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, who had firmly grasped the initiative on the battlefield, smashed the U.S. aggressors' thousands of large and small "sweeping" operations. When the rainy season began this year, the U.S. aggressors were busy dealing with the aftermath of their second dry season failure and desperately strengthening their defensive positions. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam, seizing the opportunity, launched continuous attacks without giving the enemy a moment's respite, achieving numerous victories. When the dry season began this year, the U.S. aggressors were at a loss. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam launched fierce attacks on various battlefields, making the passive U.S. aggressor troops be led by the nose, issuing a chorus of lamentations. The U.S. paper tiger once again exposed its true colors on the battlefield.

The military and civilian people of South Vietnam are highly proactive, which is like a red line, clearly running through the entire South Vietnamese battlefield this year.

At the beginning of last dry season, the U.S. aggressors, relying on their meager resources, launched the so-called "search and destroy" and "pacification" "pincer operations." In the seven months of the dry season alone, they launched more than 60 large-scale "sweeping" operations with brigade-level and above forces. The largest "sweeping" operation in the history of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors mobilized 45,000 troops and a large number of combat weapons to launch a savage attack on the West Ninh liberation area. However, all these "sweeping" operations were miserably defeated under the brave counterattacks of the people's liberation armed forces. To severely strike the U.S. puppet troops, the people's liberation armed forces, while counterattacking the enemy's large-scale invasion of the West Ninh liberation area, actively opened up new battlefields south of the demilitarized zone. Their powerful offensive on this battlefield immediately disrupted the U.S. aggressors' formation. The U.S. military leaders, in a panic, withdrew a large number of troops from the central and southern battlefields, including the West Ninh region, to the south of the demilitarized zone for rescue. But the more they went, the more they were annihilated. While the enemy's forces on other battlefields became even more depleted, they suffered consecutive attacks from the people's liberation armed forces.

It was in this situation that the U.S. aggressors' so-called "second dry season offensive" suffered a thorough defeat. Throughout the dry season, the U.S. puppet troops were killed and wounded 175,000 times, including 70,000 U.S. aggressor troops.

It was in this situation that the U.S. aggressors, after entering the rainy season, were completely in a passive position, unable to launch a relatively large-scale and long-term military operation. As a result, in the more than five months of this year's rainy season, the enemy was annihilated by the people's liberation armed forces 143,000 times (including 63,000 U.S. aggressor troops), doubling the number of the same period last year.

After the beginning of this year's dry season, the people's liberation armed forces launched more extensive and frequent attacks. According to preliminary statistics, in two months, the people's liberation armed forces annihilated more than 40,000 enemy troops, including nearly 20,000 U.S. aggressor troops and mercenary troops.

The boundless power of people's war has completely bankrupted the U.S. "advantage."

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "The deepest source of the great power of war lies among the people." Only people's war can defeat the enemy of the nation. The unprecedented favorable situation in South Vietnam this year is a great victory of the iron will of the 14 million military and civilian people of South Vietnam to defeat U.S. imperialism, a new great victory of people's war.

In this year, the people of various places in South Vietnam have been more widely mobilized in the anti-U.S. resistance war. Men, women, old, and young compete to be models of support and "brave warriors who annihilate the U.S." They spread the net of people's war everywhere. With the support of tens of millions of people, the liberation army, local forces, and guerrillas can roam freely, striking the enemy not only on the battlefield but also deeply into the enemy's important cities, rear bases, and airfields, severely punishing the U.S. puppet troops in the enemy's heart. The coordination of various battlefields, the close cooperation of the three armed forces, especially the guerrillas and local forces, not only played the role of consuming, tying, and disturbing the enemy in the battle but also greatly improved their combat effectiveness, annihilating a large number of enemies. In the victorious battles of this summer and autumn rainy season, the total number of enemies annihilated by the guerrillas and local forces alone reached 100,000, accounting for about 72% of the total number of enemies annihilated in this period. This fully shows the powerful force of people's guerrilla war.

The people's liberation armed forces, with the support of the people, creatively used various clever tactics—mine warfare, tunnel warfare, water and land transportation warfare, surprise attacks, etc., making the enemy unable to move an inch, in a miserable state. Particularly worthy of praise is the great development of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam in surprise attacks this year. The people's liberation armed forces, under the cover and support of the people, often appeared and disappeared like ghosts, attacking airfields, warehouses, military and political headquarters, and front-line command posts, achieving brilliant victories. According to statistics, in the dry season battles of last winter and this spring, the people's armed forces launched 46 surprise attacks on 25 heavily guarded enemy airfields and bases. In the summer and autumn rainy season this year, they launched 35 successful attacks on 18 large enemy airfields and bases, 50 times into 30 cities and provincial capitals occupied by the enemy, annihilating a large number of the enemy's combat effectiveness and war tools. The U.S. aggressors admitted that more than 60% of the aircraft they lost in South Vietnam were destroyed by the people's liberation armed forces in their bases.

The unprecedented brilliant victories achieved by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam this year were achieved under the condition of highly exploiting the human factor. Although the U.S. aggressors, with tenfold ferocity, used more than twice the number of combat tools compared to last year, continuously launching B-52 bombers and other types of aircraft for indiscriminate bombing, consuming 1.7 million shells and billions of bullets per month, they were still beaten to pieces by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam, although they did not have airplanes, tanks, or warships, were able to shoot down and destroy a large number of enemy airplanes, tanks, and sink and damage a large number of enemy ships. The legs of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam were more mobile than the enemy's cars and airplanes. The military and civilian people of South Vietnam, who are not afraid of hardship and death, have become the real strongmen on the battlefield, while the enemy, who is fighting an unjust war and is cowardly, is a real weakling on the battlefield. As the heroic soldiers of the people's liberation armed forces said: The enemy relies on steel, airplanes, and cannons, while we rely on the spiritual power of fighting for the liberation of the motherland. Our spiritual power is ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times stronger than the enemy's material power.... This is the fundamental reason why the people of South Vietnam are invincible.

The heroic people of South Vietnam are stronger and stronger in the war, and the U.S. imperialists who cause trouble will surely perish.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "The imperialists will never put down their butcher's knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their destruction." "Anything that is reactionary, if you do not strike it, it will not fall." The facts show that U.S. imperialism is exactly like this. Although it suffered a crushing defeat in the South Vietnamese battlefield this year, it is not willing to accept its failure and is still trying every means to escalate the war, attempting to reverse its defeat. Recently, the head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, convened a meeting in the White House to expand the war in Vietnam, plotting to "accelerate ground warfare in Vietnam" in early next year, intensify air raids on North Vietnam, and speed up the dispatch of cannon fodder to South Vietnam. According to recent revelations from U.S. officials and newspapers, U.S. imperialism is plotting to expand the war in Vietnam to Laos and Cambodia. Johnson will "support a more intense, more severe, and shorter war" before the U.S. presidential election next year. At the same time, U.S. imperialism is also intensifying its collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, playing the "peace talks" trick, in order to grab what they cannot get on the battlefield.

Facing the counter-revolutionary war "and" two-handed policy that U.S. imperialism has always used, the heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam are neither afraid of the enemy's threats nor believe the enemy's "good words." They resolutely respond to the solemn call of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, to not fear hardship and sacrifice, to severely strike the enemy, and to achieve the final victory. In the past two and a half years, due to the persistence of people's war by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, they have already made the U.S. imperialists, who launched a "limited war," suffer heavy losses of more than 200,000 troops. In the coming months, no matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists struggle, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, who have accumulated rich combat experience, will surely be able to defeat all the counterattacks of U.S. imperialism and achieve a thorough victory in the anti-U.S. resistance war. "In June, the heavenly troops march to exterminate evil, with a ten-thousand-foot long rope to capture the rocs." Chairman Mao had already prophesied in 1963: "U.S. imperialism will ultimately be driven out of South Vietnam." This is the inevitable fate of the U.S. aggressor troops. The fact that the military and civilian people of South Vietnam achieved unprecedented brilliant victories in 1967 further indicates that the doomsday of the U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam is approaching.

　　毛主席说：“美帝国主义终将从越南南方滚出去。”
　　毛主席说
    新华社十八日讯　本社记者述评：一九六七年是坚持人民战争的越南南方军民赢得空前辉煌胜利的一年。他们以“独有英雄驱虎豹”的大无畏精神，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，把四十七万美国侵略军、五十多万伪军和五万多帮凶军打得焦头烂额，走投无路，使号称“强大”的美帝国主义在南越战场上深深陷入空前被动的困境，面临灭顶的命运。
    一年来，南越各地捷报频传。从北部的广治—承天到南部的金瓯角，从沿海各地到中部高原，甚至在美伪老巢西贡，到处响起了人民解放武装力量打击敌人的枪炮声。一千四百万英雄的越南南方军民，发扬决战决胜的精神，团结战斗，充分发挥人民战争的无穷威力，打败了美帝国主义及其走狗的一次又一次的疯狂反扑。据不完全统计，南越军民单在今年头十一个月中就消灭了美国侵略军十几万人。这大大超过了美帝国主义今年向南越增兵约八万人的数字。这充分表明，南越军民已经打出了空前大好的形势。
    南越军民无比主动美国强盗处处挨打
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出，“主动权即是军队的自由权。军队失掉了主动权，被逼处于被动地位，这个军队就不自由，就有被消灭或被打败的危险。”一年来的战局表明，南越军民比往年更加牢固地掌握着战场上的主动权；而美国侵略军却处处挨打，丧失了主动权。
    在刚刚进入一九六七年，即进入美国强盗发动所谓“第二个旱季反攻”后期的时候，稳操战场上主动权的南越军民，粉碎了美国强盗发动的数以千计的大小规模“扫荡”；在进入今年雨季，美国侵略者正在收拾第二个旱季失败残局、拚命加强自己防御地位的时候，南越军民乘胜前进，不让敌人有片刻喘息的机会，连续发动进攻，取得累累战果；在开始进入今年旱季，美国强盗陷于一筹莫展的时候，南越军民又在各个战场上发起猛攻，使被动挨打的美国侵略军被牵着鼻子转，发出了一片悲鸣。美国纸老虎在战场上再一次原形毕露。
    南越军民无比主动，这象一条红线，鲜明地贯穿着今年整个的南越战局。
    去年旱季开始时，美国侵略强盗凭借他们手上的一点本钱，曾气势汹汹地发动了所谓“寻歼”和“绥靖”的“钳形攻势”。单在旱季七个月中他们就发动师以上兵力的大规模“扫荡”六十多次，其中号称侵越战争史上最大的一次“扫荡”，美国强盗动用了四万五千名兵力和大量的作战武器，向西宁解放区猖狂进犯。但是，所有这些“扫荡”，在人民解放武装力量的英勇反击下，都遭到了可耻的失败。为了痛击美伪军，人民解放武装力量在迎击大举进犯西宁解放区的敌人的同时，主动地开辟了非军事区以南的新战场。他们在这个战场上的强大攻势，一下子打乱了美国侵略军的阵脚。美军头目仓惶从中部和南部战场，包括西宁地区在内，抽调大量兵力赶到非军事区以南去救援，但去的愈多，被消灭的愈多。而其它战场上敌人的兵力更加空虚，接连遭到人民解放武装力量的袭击。
    就是在这样的情况下，美国侵略军大吹大擂的所谓“第二个旱季反攻”遭到了彻底失败。在整个旱季中，美伪军被打死打伤十七万五千多名，其中包括美国侵略军七万名。
    就是在这样的情况下，美国侵略军在进入雨季后，完全处于被动挨打的地位，无力发动一次较大规模和较长时间的军事行动。结果，在今年雨季五个多月中，敌人共被人民解放武装力量歼灭十四万三千多名（包括美国侵略军六万三千多名），比去年同期增加一倍。
    今年旱季开始以后，人民解放武装力量发动了更加广泛而频繁的进攻。据初步统计，在两个月里，人民解放武装力量共歼灭敌军四万多名，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军近两万名。
    人民战争威力无穷美国“优势”完全破产
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”只有人民战争，才能战胜民族敌人。越南南方今年的空前大好形势，正是一千四百万越南南方军民广泛动员起来，决心战胜美帝国主义的钢铁意志的伟大胜利，是人民战争的新的伟大胜利。
    在这一年中，南越各地的人民群众，在抗美救国战争中更加广泛地动员了起来，男女老少争当支前模范和“歼美勇士”，他们到处撒下了人民战争的天罗地网。由于千百万群众的支援，解放军、地方部队和游击队能够纵横驰骋，活动自如，不仅在战火纷飞的战场上痛击敌人，而且能够深入敌人的重要城镇、后方基地和机场，在敌人的心脏里严惩美伪军。各个战场作战协调，三种武装力量配合紧密。特别是游击队和地方部队，在战斗中不仅发挥了消耗、牵制和扰乱敌人的作用，而且大大地提高了作战能力，大量地消灭了敌人。在今年夏秋雨季的胜利战斗中，单是游击队和地方部队的歼敌总额就达十万名，约占这个时期歼敌总数的百分之七十二。这充分说明了人民游击战争的强大威力。
    人民解放武装力量三种部队在人民群众的支持下，创造性地运用了各种巧妙的战术——地雷战、地道战、水上和陆上交通战、奇袭战等，把敌人打得寸步难行，狼狈不堪。特别值得称颂的是南越军民今年在奇袭战方面的巨大发展。人民解放武装力量在人民的掩护和支持下，经常神出鬼没地打进敌人巢穴，袭击机场、仓库、军政首脑机关和前线指挥所，取得了辉煌的胜利。据统计，在去冬今春旱季战斗中，人民武装曾四十六次奇袭了敌人重兵防守的二十五个机场和基地。在今年夏秋雨季中，他们又三十五次胜利地袭击了敌人十八个大的机场和基地，五十次打进了三十个被敌人占据的城镇和省会，消灭了敌人大批的有生力量和战争工具。美国侵略者承认，它们在南越损失的飞机百分之六十以上是在基地里被人民解放武装力量击毁的。
    今年南越军民取得的空前辉煌胜利，是高度发挥人的因素的情况下取得的。虽然美国侵略强盗以十倍的疯狂，使用了比去年多一倍以上的作战工具，不断出动B—52型轰炸机和其他种飞机进行狂轰滥炸，每月消耗炮弹达一百七十万发和枪弹成亿发，但是在南越军民的英勇战斗下，敌人仍被打得落花流水。南越军民自己虽然没有飞机、坦克、军舰，却能击落、击毁敌人大量飞机、坦克，击沉击伤敌人大量船舰。南越军民的双腿却比敌人的军车和飞机机动得多。不怕苦、不怕死的南越军民成了战场上的真正强者，而进行不义之战、贪生怕死的敌人却是战场上货真价实的弱者。正如英雄的人民解放武装力量战士所说的：敌人依靠的是钢铁、飞机、大炮，我们依靠的是为祖国解放而战的精神力量。我们的精神力量比敌人的物质力量强大十倍、百倍、千倍……。这就是南越人民不可战胜的根本原因。
    英雄人民越战越强美帝捣乱必将灭亡
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”事实表明，美帝国主义正是这样。今年它虽然在南越战场上遭到惨败，但是它并不甘心自己的失败，它仍然千方百计地加紧扩大战争，妄图挽回自己的败局。最近美帝国主义头子约翰逊曾纠集军政头目在白宫召开了一次扩大侵越战争的黑会，策划在明年初“加速在越南的地面战争”，加紧对越南北方的空袭活动，并且加速向南越增派炮灰。据美国官方和报刊最近透露，美国阴谋要把侵越战争扩大到老挝和柬埔寨，约翰逊在明年美国总统选举以前，“将赞成打一场更激烈、更厉害和更短时间的战争”。和这同时，美帝国主义还加紧同苏修领导集团勾结，玩弄“和谈”骗局，以便捞到战场上捞不到的东西。
    面对着美帝国主义一贯使用的反革命战“和”两手政策，英雄的越南南方军民既不怕敌人的恐吓，也不相信敌人的“好话”。他们坚决响应越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的庄严号召，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，狠狠地打击敌人，直到取得最后胜利。在过去两年多的时间里，由于越南南方军民坚持人民战争，已经使发动“局部战争”的美帝国主义损兵折将二十多万人。在今后的年月里，不管美帝国主义如何疯狂挣扎，已经积累了丰富战斗经验的越南南方军民，必然能够打败美帝国主义的一切反扑，取得抗美救国战争的彻底胜利。“六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”毛主席早在一九六三年就曾经预言：“美帝国主义终将从越南南方滚出去。”这是美国侵略强盗的必然下场。一九六七年南越军民赢得空前辉煌胜利的事实进一步预示，美国强盗在南越的末日愈来愈临近了。（附图片）
