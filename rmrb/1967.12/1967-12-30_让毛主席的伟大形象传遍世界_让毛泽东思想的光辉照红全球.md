The revolutionary workers of the Dongfanghong Silk Weaving Factory in Hangzhou, filled with deep affection and love for the great leader, are weaving a large number of silk portraits of Chairman Mao, as well as his calligraphy of poems and quotations.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou, the revolutionary cadres and workers of the Dongfanghong Silk Weaving Factory in Hangzhou, with deep affection and love for Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts, are weaving silk portraits of Chairman Mao, as well as his calligraphy of poems and quotations. Currently, they are producing over 33,000 pieces daily, which is 35 times more than before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres and workers of this factory all feel extremely fortunate to personally weave silk portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao. They say, Chairman Mao is the most revered great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. Revolutionary people around the world are eagerly awaiting a portrait or silk portrait of Chairman Mao to draw inspiration and strength from the brilliant image of the great leader Mao. The more silk portraits of Chairman Mao we weave, the more we contribute to the world revolution. We must spread the brilliant image of Chairman Mao throughout the world and let the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the entire globe.

The Dongfanghong Silk Weaving Factory was originally named Dujinsheng Silk Weaving Factory. After the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the proletarian revolutionary cadres and Red Guards of this factory, together, smashed the old signboard named after the capitalist "Dujinsheng" and replaced it with the shining "Dongfanghong" in golden letters as the name of their factory, expressing their boundless love for Chairman Mao and their enthusiasm for promoting Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary workers of this factory raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, with indignant hearts, exposing and criticizing the heinous crimes and revisionist goods of the greatest capitalist-roader within the Party and his agents who obstructed and resisted the weaving of silk portraits of Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary workers of this factory, in order to weave more and better silk portraits of Chairman Mao, focused on revolution and vigorously promoted production during the Cultural Revolution, displaying boundless enthusiasm and tapping into every possible resource. Before the Cultural Revolution, there were only four silk-weaving machines for weaving portraits of Chairman Mao, but now there are 127; each worker used to operate one machine, but now they operate two. Originally, there was only one type of half-body portrait of Chairman Mao, but now they have woven many types, including "Chairman Mao Receives the Red Guards" and "Chairman Mao's Seventh Inspection of the Cultural Revolution Army." During the entire production process, the revolutionary workers encountered many difficulties in equipment, technology, and other aspects. However, they said, the great leader Chairman Mao is always by our side. As long as we see him, we gain boundless strength, and no matter how great the difficulties, we can overcome them. The broad revolutionary workers poured their deep class feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao into their weaving work, ensuring the high quality of the woven products of Chairman Mao's silk portraits, his calligraphy of poems, and quotations.

    让毛主席的伟大形象传遍世界  让毛泽东思想的光辉照红全球
    杭州东方红丝织厂革命职工满怀对伟大领袖无限热爱的深厚感情，大量织造毛主席丝织像和毛主席诗词手迹、毛主席语录
    据新华社杭州电　杭州东方红丝织厂的革命派和革命职工，怀着对我们心中的红太阳毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情，织造毛主席丝织像和毛主席诗词手迹、毛主席语录。目前，每天织造三万三千多幅，比无产阶级文化大革命以前增加三十五倍。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，都为自己能亲手织造我们伟大领袖毛主席的丝织像而感到无比幸福。他们说，毛主席是世界革命人民最崇敬的伟大领袖。世界革命人民都盼望能得到一幅毛主席的画像或丝织像，从伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象中得到鼓舞和力量。我们多织一幅毛主席丝织像，就是为世界革命多出了一份力量。我们要让毛主席的光辉形象传遍全世界，让伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照红全地球。
    东方红丝织厂原名都锦生丝织厂。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命展开以后，这个厂的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将一起，砸烂了“都锦生”这个以资本家的名字命名的旧招牌，用金光闪闪的“东方红”三个大字作为自己工厂的名字，以表达他们无限热爱毛主席、热情宣传毛泽东思想的决心。这个厂的革命职工高举革命的批判大旗，以无比愤怒的心情，揭发、批判了党内最大的走资派及其代理人阻挠和抵制织造毛主席丝织像的滔天罪行和修正主义黑货。
    这个厂的革命职工为了织造更多更好的毛主席丝织像，在文化大革命中狠抓革命，猛促生产，发挥冲天干劲，多方挖掘潜力。织造毛主席像的丝织机，文化大革命以前只有四台，现在增加到一百二十七台；每个工人过去只看一台，现在看到两台。毛主席丝织像原来只有一种半身的，现在已经织出了《毛主席接见红卫兵》、《毛主席第七次检阅文化革命大军》等很多种。在整个生产过程中，革命职工在设备、技术等方面遇到了许多困难。但是，他们说，伟大领袖毛主席天天在我们身旁，只要看到他老人家，我们身上就增添了无穷无尽的力量，天大的困难也能克服。广大革命职工把对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，倾注到织造工作中去，保证了毛主席丝织像和毛主席诗词手迹、毛主席语录等织造品的高质量。
