		According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, led by Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, sent a telegram on the 19th to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, warmly congratulating the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on its seventh anniversary.

		The telegram expressed the determination of the people of North Vietnam to resolutely frustrate any "escalation" of the war by the American aggressors, to ensure the construction of socialism, and to fulfill their pledge to support the struggle of the 14 million people of South Vietnam for national salvation and against American aggression.

		The telegram pointed out: The ten-point program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the recently published political program have united more and more patriotic and democratic forces, and are leading the revolutionary cause of South Vietnam to make great strides forward. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, with its increasingly high prestige at home and abroad, has become the sole true representative, organizer, and inspirer of all victories of the heroic people of South Vietnam.

		The telegram exposed the fact that American imperialism is intensifying its savage bombing of Hanoi, expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and plotting to spread the flames of war to the entire Indochina Peninsula, while continuing to play the old "peace talks" trick. The telegram pointed out that these savage and shameful schemes of American imperialism only show that they are in a state of desperate despair.

		The telegram said that the indomitable Vietnamese people are determined to strengthen their unity, fully utilize the victories already won, and resolutely and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

		According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: On the 19th, the Vietnam People's Daily and the Vietnam People's Army Daily published editorials to commemorate the 21st anniversary of the Vietnam National Resistance Day (December 19), calling on all military and civilian personnel of Vietnam to carry forward the glorious traditions of the anti-French war, to press on to victory, and to push the struggle for national salvation and against American aggression to its final victory.

		The editorial of the Vietnam People's Daily pointed out that under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people had fought continuously for eight years in the past, ending the rule of French colonialism; now, in the fierce struggle against the most ferocious and brutal imperialism of the contemporary era—the American imperialism—they have already achieved extremely great and glorious victories. In the current third winter-spring-drought season of fighting, the Vietnamese people are advancing with the spirit of victors. The situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle for national salvation and against American aggression has never been as favorable and inspiring as it is now. The people's war has invincible power and will certainly defeat the American imperialist aggressors.

		The editorial of the Vietnam People's Army Daily said that the Vietnamese people's long and arduous struggle for national salvation and against American aggression has achieved tremendous victories and is now in a very intense stage. Although American imperialism has suffered a crushing defeat, it continues to send more troops and war equipment to South Vietnam, preparing to further gamble on expanding the war. However, all these desperate actions of the enemy are only the death throes of a heavily wounded beast.

		According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: On the 22nd, the Vietnam People's Daily and the Vietnam People's Army Daily published editorials, warmly celebrating the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army.

		The editorial of the Vietnam People's Daily, after recounting the 23-year history of the construction and combat of the Vietnam People's Army and the glorious victories it has achieved, said: "Our people's army is the vanguard force of the sacred struggle of the entire people for national salvation and against American aggression. Our army has never fought such a large-scale war against the brutal American imperialism as it is fighting today, and it has never achieved such brilliant victories as it is achieving today."

		The editorial said that our people are determined to use all their spirit and strength to support the armed forces of the people, and to fully implement the current central slogan: Everything for the defeat of the American aggressors.

		The editorial of the Vietnam People's Army Daily said that our military and civilian personnel not only have an iron will to fight but also possess the sharp weapon to defeat the enemy, that is, the people's war. Our great people's war has invincible power because it fully embodies the slogan of the entire people participating in the battle and brings into play all the potential of our nation.

		According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: According to reports from local newspapers, on the 22nd, the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army issued instructions to the main forces, local forces, and self-defense militia, calling on all cadres and soldiers of the people's armed forces to carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, to fight to the end, and to celebrate the three glorious anniversaries (the 21st anniversary of the Vietnam National Resistance, the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, and the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army) with more brilliant victories, and to strive for the complete victory of the struggle for national salvation and against American aggression.

    乘胜前进夺取抗美救国战争彻底胜利
    越南祖国战线热烈祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年
    人民军总司令部和报纸号召军民以更辉煌战功庆祝三个光辉节日
    据新华社河内电　据越南通讯社报道：越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜代表越南祖国战线中央委员会和越南北方各阶层人民，十九日打电报给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席，热烈祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年。
    贺电表示越南北方人民坚决粉碎美国强盗的任何战争“升级”，保证建设社会主义和实现他们支持一千四百万南方人民抗美救国斗争的誓言。
    贺电指出：越南南方民族解放阵线的十点纲领和新近公布的政治纲领已经团结了越来越多的爱国民主力量，并且领导着越南南方的革命事业大踏步前进。越南南方民族解放阵线随着在国内和全世界所取得的越来越高的威望，已经成为英雄的越南南方人民的唯一的真正代表、一切胜利的组织者和鼓舞者。
    贺电揭露美帝国主义正在加紧对河内的野蛮轰炸，扩大侵越战争，并且阴谋把战火扩大到整个印度支那，同时还继续玩弄陈旧的“和谈”骗局。贺电指出，美帝国主义的这些野蛮的和可耻的阴谋只能表明他们已处于绝望的困境。
    贺电说，不屈不挠的越南人民决心加强团结，充分发挥已经取得的胜利，坚决彻底打败美国侵略者。
    据新华社河内电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》十九日为纪念越南全国抗战日（十二月十九日）二十一周年分别发表社论，号召越南全体军民发扬抗法战争的光荣传统，乘胜前进，把抗美救国斗争推向最后胜利。
    《人民报》的社论指出，越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下，过去曾连续抗战八年，结束了法国殖民主义的统治；现在在同当代最凶恶、最残暴的帝国主义——美帝国主义进行激烈战斗中，又已经取得了极其巨大和辉煌的胜利。在目前的第三个冬春旱季战斗中，越南人民正以战胜者的气概奋勇前进。越南人民的抗美救国战争形势，从来也没有象现在这样有利和振奋人心。人民战争具有无敌的威力，必将战胜美帝国主义侵略者。
    《人民军队报》的社论说，越南人民的长期和艰苦的抗美救国斗争取得了十分巨大的胜利，并且正处在十分激烈的阶段。美帝国主义虽然遭到了惨败，但它仍继续向越南南方增派军队和战争工具，准备进一步冒险扩大战争。然而敌人的所有这些疯狂行动，只不过是一只负了重伤的野兽的垂死挣扎。
    据新华社河内电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》二十二日分别发表社论，热烈庆祝越南人民军建军二十三周年。
    《人民报》的社论在叙述了越南人民军二十三年来的建设和战斗历程以及所取得的辉煌胜利后说：“我们人民军是全民神圣的抗美救国斗争的突击力量。我们军队从来没有象今天这样进行着一场反对残暴的美帝国主义的大规模战争，也从来没有象今天这样立下许多显赫、辉煌的战功”。
    社论说，我国人民决心以全部精神和力量支援人民武装力量，全部实现当前的中心口号：一切为了战胜美国侵略强盗。
    《人民军队报》的社论说，我们军民不但具有钢铁般的战斗意志，而且还掌握了战胜敌人的锐利武器，那就是人民战争。我国伟大的人民战争具有无敌的威力，因为它最充分地体现了全民参加战斗的口号，发挥了我们民族的一切潜力。
    据新华社河内电　据此间报纸报道，越南人民军总司令部二十二日向主力部队、地方部队和民兵自卫队发出指示，号召人民武装力量全体干部和战士发扬彻底革命精神，坚决战斗到底，用更辉煌的战功来庆祝三个光辉的节日（越南全国抗战二十一周年、越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年和越南人民军建军二十三周年），并进而夺取抗美救国事业的彻底胜利。
