The Sato reactionary government of Japan, in collusion with the Gombun revisionist group, has intensified its hostility towards China, sabotaged the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and deliberately disrupted the performance of the Chinese Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe in Japan. On the morning of December 4, the Japanese police openly kidnapped Chen Xuequan, a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese Association who was assisting the Chinese Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe's performance.

Chen Xuequan, a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese Association, was just leaving the association's headquarters in Tokyo on the morning of December 4 when he was surrounded by several plainclothes Japanese police officers, pushed into a car, and abducted. Several hours later, the Tokyo Chinese Association learned from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department that Chen Xuequan had been "escorted" by plane to Hokkaido at 1:20 PM. The police authorities falsely accused Chen Xuequan of having "injury suspicions" in the incident where the Gombun revisionist group disrupted the performance of the Chinese acrobatic troupe in Iwakizawa City, Hokkaido, last month.

The Tokyo Chinese Association issued a statement of protest that afternoon, pointing out that the serious incident of the Japanese police authorities illegally kidnapping a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese Association was a despicable and vicious political persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese in Japan by the Sato government. It was also a malicious act by the Sato government to further intensify its hostility towards China and persecute overseas Chinese in Japan.

The statement pointed out that during the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat, the Chinese Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe's performance in Japan was enthusiastically welcomed and supported by the broad masses of the Japanese people. However, the Gombun revisionist group, which has betrayed the Japanese people, fearing the spread of the great thought of Mao Zedong, did everything possible to sabotage the performance of the acrobatic troupe.

The statement pointed out that the Gombun group's crime of disrupting the performance of the Chinese acrobatic troupe in Iwakizawa City on November 25, and the incident of the Japanese police authorities illegally arresting a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese Association, were not accidental. This was a planned anti-China incident jointly fabricated by the Japanese reactionaries and the Gombun revisionist group.

The statement said, "Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until you are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic.' All those who are anti-China and sabotage the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan will meet a bad end."

The statement concluded by expressing that patriotic overseas Chinese in Japan who love Chairman Mao, love socialist motherland, and sincerely hope for the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan will resolutely stand with the Japanese people to firmly fight against the savage acts of the Sato government and the anti-China conspiracies of the Gombun revisionist group.

The headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, and the Tokyo Chinese Association held an emergency press conference on the evening of December 4 to strongly protest the Sato government's blatant dispatch of plainclothes police to kidnap a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese Association. They also demanded that the Japanese police authorities immediately release Chen Xuequan, who was illegally abducted.

In the statement of protest, Miyazaki Seiken, chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), pointed out that this incident was a conspiracy to disrupt the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and sabotage the performance of the Chinese Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe in Japan. The statement said, "This is another anti-China conspiracy carried out by the Japanese police authorities in collusion with the Gombun revisionist group."

A representative of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association also spoke at the press conference, strongly protesting the Japanese government's hostility towards China, persecution of patriotic overseas Chinese in Japan, and sabotage of the friendship and trade between the peoples of China and Japan.

    坚决粉碎佐藤政府和宫本集团反华阴谋
    东京华侨总会和日中友协（正统）总部等强烈抗议日当局迫害爱国华侨
    据新华社东京七日电 日本佐藤反动政府，伙同宫本修正主义集团加紧敌视中国，破坏中日两国人民友好，蓄意破坏中国东方红杂技团访日演出，在四日上午公然派出警察非法绑架了协助中国东方红杂技团演出的东京华侨总会工作人员陈学全。
    东京华侨总会工作人员陈学全，十二月四日上午刚刚从东京华侨总会出门之后，就被数名日本便衣警察包围，推上汽车，绑架而去。数小时之后东京华侨总会才从东京警视厅了解到在下午一点二十分陈学全已被警察用飞机“押送”到北海道。警察当局竟给陈学全强加上莫须有的“罪名”，无中生有地诬蔑陈学全在上月宫本修正主义集团在北海道岩见泽市制造的破坏中国杂技团演出的事件中有“伤害嫌疑”。
    东京华侨总会当天下午发表抗议声明指出，这次日本警察当局非法绑架东京华侨总会工作人员的严重事件，是佐藤政府对旅日爱国华侨极其卑鄙恶毒的政治迫害，同时是佐藤政府蓄谋进一步敌视中国和迫害旅日华侨的罪恶行为。
    声明指出，在中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行的时候，中国东方红杂技团访日演出，受到了广大日本人民的极其热烈的欢迎和支持。但是，背叛了日本人民的宫本修正主义集团，由于害怕伟大的毛泽东思想的传播，千方百计地破坏杂技团的演出。
    声明指出，十一月二十五日宫本集团在岩见泽市破坏中国杂技团演出的罪行，以及日本警察当局非法逮捕东京华侨总会工作人员的事件，决不是偶然的。这是日本反动派和宫本修正主义集团勾结一起，有计划制造的一次反华事件。
    声明说，伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”一切反华和破坏中日两国人民友好的人，都绝不会有好下场。
    声明最后表示：热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义祖国、衷心期望中日两国人民友好的旅日爱国华侨，坚决同日本人民站在一起，为粉碎佐藤政府的野蛮暴行和宫本修正主义集团的反华阴谋而坚决进行斗争。
    日中友好协会（正统）总部、日本国际贸易促进协会、日中文化交流协会和东京华侨总会，四日晚举行紧急记者招待会，强烈抗议佐藤政府公然派遣便衣警察绑架东京华侨总会工作人员的罪行，并且要求日本警察当局立即释放被非法绑架的陈学全。
    日中友协（正统）总部理事长宫崎世民在抗议声明中指出：这次事件是破坏日中两国人民友好和破坏中国东方红杂技团在日本演出的阴谋。声明说：“这是日本警察当局与宫本修正主义集团勾结起来进行的又一次反华阴谋。”
    日本国际贸易促进协会代表也在记者招待会上发表谈话，强烈抗议日本政府当局敌视中国，迫害旅日爱国华侨，破坏日中两国人民友好和日中友好贸易的罪行。
