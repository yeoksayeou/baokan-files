The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, who spouts the nonsense that "regardless of whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat," is plotting a great conspiracy. According to his logic, whether it is capitalism or socialism, whether it is poor and lower-middle peasants or landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements, as long as they can increase production and make money, they are good. If we expose this, we see that he is actually trying to make us abandon the dictatorship of the proletariat and let his "white cats" and "black cats" all come out, allowing the reactionary class to reign in China once again. Nonsense! This is absolutely unacceptable!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long taught us: "The dictatorship of the revolution and the dictatorship of the counterrevolution are diametrically opposed, and the former learns from the latter. This learning is very important. If the revolutionary people do not learn this method of ruling the counterrevolutionary class, they will not be able to maintain power, and their power will be overthrown by the internal and external reactionaries. The internal and external reactionaries will restore power in China, and the revolutionary people will suffer." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Looking back at the old society, our proletariat and poor peasants had no hope for generations. Who knows how many families fled to foreign lands, wives and children separated; and who knows how many class brothers were killed by the enemy's butcher knives, families destroyed. I often heard my father say that our old militia commander, Comrade Zhang Zhishan, was captured by the Kuomintang reactionaries, nailed to a brick wall with twenty-one iron nails, and died a slow death. In Hongdeng Village, there was a pregnant woman about to give birth who was dragged away by a group of Japanese devils to be raped, and then her stomach was cut open, and the baby was skewered on a bayonet for "fun." At that time, why were we trampled, tortured, and slaughtered? It was because we had not seized the guns and the power, because we did not have the dictatorship of the proletariat.

However, the revolutionary fire of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people in our country is indestructible. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we bravely fought, fearing no sacrifice, and fought to the end with the enemy, finally achieving revolutionary victory and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the proletariat took power, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings and implemented the policy of "not granting mercy to the enemy class," allowing them to behave only in an orderly manner and not allowing them to speak or act recklessly. We implemented the dictatorship over the reactionary ruling class that had once oppressed the people, suppressed their resistance to the revolution, stopped their restoration activities, and defended the victory of the people's revolution. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is extremely uncomfortable with the dictatorship of the proletariat, forming a faction with the Chinese Khrushchev, desperately opposing it. Isn't this the greatest betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause and the dictatorship of the proletariat?

The barking of mad dogs cannot stop the advance of warhorses. The attacks of the capitalist-roaders cannot shake our resolve to implement the dictatorship over the enemy. The militia armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never listen to your lies, will never fraternize with the class enemy, and will never greet them with handshakes and smiles. We will never reconcile with the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements, and we will never compromise with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. We must always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat. Let the wheels of the dictatorship of the proletariat roll forward, crushing the class enemies to smithereens!

    疯狗狂吠，拦不住战马前进
    学习毛主席著作积极分子红武大队民兵营副教导员  曹连凤
    党内另一个最大的走资派，胡诌“不管白猫黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫”，这是一个大阴谋。照他的说法，不管是资本主义，还是社会主义，不管是贫下中农，还是地、富、反、坏分子，只要能增产，能赚钱就是好的。揭穿了看，他原不过是要我们放弃无产阶级专政，让他的“白猫”“黑猫”统统出笼，让反动阶级的统治在中国死灰复燃。呸！这是万万办不到的！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席早就教导我们说：“革命的专政和反革命的专政，性质是相反的，而前者是从后者学来的。这个学习很要紧。革命的人民如果不学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法，他们就不能维持政权，他们的政权就会被内外反动派所推翻，内外反动派就会在中国复辟，革命的人民就会遭殃。”我们要牢牢记住毛主席这一教导，念念不忘无产阶级专政。
    回想到旧社会，我们无产阶级和贫下中农祖祖辈辈没有出头之日。不知多少人家逃亡异乡，妻离子散；又不知多少阶级兄弟死在敌人的屠刀之下，家破人亡。我常听到父亲说，我们的老民兵中队长张志山同志，被国民党反动派抓去，用二十一根铁钉钉在砖墙上，活活钉死了。红灯大队有个快要生小孩子的孕妇，被一群日本鬼子拖去轮奸，而后还破开肚子，把小孩子挑在刺刀尖上做“游戏”。那时候，我们为什么被蹂躏、受折磨、挨宰割？就是因为我们没有夺到枪杆子、掌到印把子，就是没有无产阶级专政。
    但是，我国无产阶级和广大劳动人民的革命烈火，是扑不灭的。在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，我们勇敢战斗，不怕牺牲，同敌人血战到底，终于取得了革命的胜利，建立了无产阶级专政。我们无产阶级掌权以后，遵照毛主席的教导，对阶级敌人“决不施仁政”，“只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动”。对原来骑在人民头上作威作福的反动统治阶级实行专政，镇压他们对于革命的反抗，制止他们的复辟活动，保卫人民革命的胜利。党内另一个最大的走资派对无产阶级专政，象猫爪子抓心，难过得不得了，他同中国赫鲁晓夫结成死党，拚死命地反对，这难道不是对无产阶级革命事业和无产阶级专政的最大背叛吗？
    疯狗的狂吠，拦不住战马的前进。走资派的进攻，动摇不了我们对敌人专政的决心。用毛泽东思想武装起来的民兵，绝不会听信你们的鬼话，绝不会同阶级敌人称兄道弟，握手言欢。我们同地、富、反、坏分子就是千个榔头打不合缝，我们跟党内一小撮走资派就是冰山火海绝不同炉。我们就是要念念不忘无产阶级专政。让无产阶级专政的历史车轮滚滚向前，把阶级敌人碾得粉身碎骨吧！
