The People's Liberation Army unit stationed in Wuzhishan, Hainan Island, has resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "hold study classes." While carrying out heavy construction tasks, they actively assist local minority poor and lower-middle peasants in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, ensuring that Mao Zedong Thought reaches every corner of the mountainous region and illuminates the hearts of every minority poor and lower-middle peasant.

The soldiers of the Seventh Company use their evenings to help local poor and lower-middle peasants hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which are enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Several dozen households of local minority poor and lower-middle peasants all participate in the study sessions. Many nearby Li minority poor and lower-middle peasants also come from several miles away, carrying lanterns and torches, to join the study classes.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes assisted by the Seventh Company for local minority poor and lower-middle peasants serve as classrooms for studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and as battlegrounds for criticizing and repudiating revisionism. During the study process, they use "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle and Mao Zedong's latest instructions and the "Old Three Articles" as weapons. Starting from class education, they use methods such as recalling and comparing past and present hardships and sweetness to launch a vigorous revolutionary criticism and repudiation. Through this criticism and repudiation, minority community members further understand what socialism is and what capitalism is; what Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is and what the bourgeois reactionary line is. Their class struggle awareness and consciousness of line struggle are significantly enhanced, making them love the great leader Chairman Mao even more and hate the Chinese Khrushchev even more.

Holding extensive study classes and launching revolutionary criticism and repudiation have brought about a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the Wuzhishan region's minority villages.

　　解放军帮助苗族贫农下中农办学习班
　　中国人民解放军驻海南岛五指山某部七连，坚决响应毛主席“要办学习班”的伟大号召，在担负繁重施工任务的同时，积极帮助驻地苗族贫下中农举办毛泽东思想学习班，让毛泽东思想占领山区的每个角落，照亮每一个苗族贫下中农的心。
    七连指战员利用晚上时间，帮助驻地贫下中农举办毛泽东思想学习班，受到广大贫下中农的热烈欢迎。驻地几十户苗族贫下中农，家家户户都来参加学习。附近许多黎族贫下中农，也从几里地外，打着灯笼火把，赶来学习。
    七连协助驻地兄弟民族贫下中农举办的毛泽东思想学习班，是学习毛主席最新指示的课堂，也是斗私批修的战场。在学习过程中，他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”为武器，从阶级教育入手，用回忆对比、忆苦思甜等方法，展开了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判。通过大批判，苗族社员进一步懂得什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义；什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线，阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟大大提高，更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫。
    大办学习班，开展革命的大批判，使五指山区苗寨黎村出现了活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮。
