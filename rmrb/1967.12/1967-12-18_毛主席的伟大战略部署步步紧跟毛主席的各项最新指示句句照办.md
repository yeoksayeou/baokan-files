	Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, step by step following Chairman Mao's latest instructions, sentence by sentence carrying them out. The people and military across the nation are determined to learn from the 834th Unit supporting the left and the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, with an unyielding class sentiment of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the nation are determined to learn from the comrades of the 834th Unit supporting the left and the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory. With an unyielding class sentiment of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they will implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	The experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory in carrying out the Cultural Revolution has been transmitted to various places, inspiring and enlightening hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians. They have organized study sessions and discussions, enthusiastically praising the Cultural Revolution in the Beijing Knitting Factory as an embodiment of our great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and strategic deployment, and enthusiastically praising the 834th Unit of the People's Liberation Army supporting the left as a red flag in supporting the left. People shout thousands and thousands of times: "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

	In learning from the experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory, people in various places have repeatedly studied the three principles followed by the supporting-the-left personnel of the 834th Unit in accordance with the consistent teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao in their supporting-the-left work: vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought, doing in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work; not hastily expressing opinions, conducting investigations and research, and if both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, gradually uniting them; learning from the worker masses, not fearing mistakes, correcting them when wrong, and caring for the masses' lives. People in various places pointed out that placing the vigorous propagation of Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work, step by step following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, is not only the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in supporting the left but also the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in all work, and the fundamental guarantee for achieving a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

	The revolutionary committees or revolutionary committee preparatory groups at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels, as well as at the grassroots level in Beijing, Shanghai, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang, and other places, have seriously studied the experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory in carrying out the Cultural Revolution. They have expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, with the greatest resolve and the fastest speed, to learn the good experiences of the 834th Unit and the revolutionary workers of the Knitting Factory. The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Municipality has specially made a decision, calling on all revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionaries in the city to link up with the actual situation of their units, summarize experiences, find gaps, and formulate improvement measures. They must better follow Chairman Mao, follow Mao Zedong Thought, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolutionaries and the three-in-one combination, do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units, better grasp revolution to promote production, and achieve new victories. A responsible comrade of the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province said, "We must especially learn from them in firmly propagating Mao Zedong Thought, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work, guiding the masses to solve problems according to Chairman Mao's teachings; learn from them in firmly grasping ideological and political work, firmly believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; learn from them in conducting in-depth investigations and research, being willing to be the students of the masses, studying, working, and struggling against selfishness and revisionism together with the masses." A responsible comrade of the preparatory group of the Revolutionary Committee of Hangzhou said, "Our preparatory group has thousands of tasks, tens of thousands of tasks, but the most fundamental task is to vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, especially emphasize the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Pioneer Electrical Machinery Factory and responsible comrades of revolutionary mass organizations, in the course of study, reviewed and checked the situation of revolution and production in their factory, and immediately formulated improvement measures. They expressed that the most fundamental thing to learn from the proletarian revolutionaries of the Beijing Knitting Factory and the 834th Unit is to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step and implement Chairman Mao's instructions the fastest, sentence by sentence. Responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Power Machinery Factory and revolutionary cadres, in the course of learning from the advanced experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory, unanimously expressed that they must take "struggle against selfishness and revisionism" as the key link, further launch a high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among all the workers in the factory, and truly achieve red-hearted loyalty to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao step by step.

	The news spread to Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangdong, Hubei, Sichuan, and many other places, and everywhere the voices of learning from the Beijing Knitting Factory could be heard. Many units of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses also reviewed their own situations, summarized experiences, found gaps, and determined to catch up and turn the experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory into their own actions. Revolutionary workers in many places in Jinan said, "The experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory is the fruitful results of the 834th Unit of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary workers of this factory listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We must be like them, deeply understand and firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, word for word and sentence for sentence, without any compromise." Revolutionary cadres of the Zhengzhou Knitting Factory, while learning from the experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory, reviewed their own factory's situation, found gaps, and determined to turn the Zhengzhou Knitting Factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary workers of the Jiangxi Tractor Factory expressed that for every instruction of Chairman Mao, whether understood or not yet understood, we must cherish an unyielding class sentiment of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, with the greatest resolve and the fastest speed, implement it sentence by sentence and firmly carry it out. Revolutionary workers of the Guangzhou Municipal Water Supply Company said, "The most important experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory is that all revolutionary workers and supporting-the-left troops in the factory follow every word and every instruction of Chairman Mao, strive to follow, deeply understand, link with reality, and implement them sentence by sentence."

	They have shown with their actual actions their boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. We must be like them, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and be genuine revolutionaries who combine study with practice and whose words and deeds are consistent.

	The broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two military affairs" have repeatedly listened to the broadcasts and quickly launched a wave of intensive study and extensive propaganda. Soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Wuhan troops, upon hearing the news, organized propaganda teams to go deep into factories, schools, stations, docks, and rural areas, extensively propagating the three principles followed by the supporting-the-left personnel of the 834th Unit. Soldiers and officers of the unit where Liu Yingjun, who was martyred in the coal mines of Hegang, Heilongjiang Province, once served, pointed out that the three principles followed by the 834th Unit in supporting-the-left work embody Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the essence of supporting-the-left work, and point out the direction for "three supports and two military affairs" work. The fourth platoon of a certain unit of the 601st Unit, which was awarded the honorable title of "Supporting-the-Left and Loving-the-People Model Platoon" by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "being humble makes one progress, being arrogant makes one fall behind," seriously studied the three principles followed by the 834th Unit in supporting-the-left work, and strictly required themselves with high standards, carrying out activities to find gaps. Soldiers and officers unanimously expressed that they must, with even greater enthusiasm and greater effort, implement the three principles in action, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and raise the work of "three supports and two military affairs" to a new level.
