In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the excellent situation in industrial and agricultural production, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members, with the attitude of masters, are enthusiastically delivering grain, cotton, and other agricultural and sideline products to the state. The agricultural product procurement work in various parts of our country has achieved tremendous results. Good news has come from Heilongjiang, where the province's grain procurement task has been completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled. The grain in storage has increased by 12 percent compared to the bumper harvest of 1966. The cotton procurement work in Shandong is progressing rapidly. By December 10, the amount of cotton procured has increased by 5.4 percent compared to the same period last year.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Grain must be grasped tightly, cotton must be grasped tightly, and cloth must be grasped tightly."

This year, our country's grain, cotton, and various agricultural and sideline products have all achieved bumper harvests. This is a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." We must press on with the momentum, with the spirit of "seizing the day," and seize the opportunity to grasp the procurement of grain, cotton, and other agricultural and sideline products, completing and overfulfilling the state's procurement tasks.

The procurement of agricultural products has a strong seasonality. Only by grasping procurement, timely storage, and proper management can the fruits of the bumper harvest be fully utilized, avoid unnecessary losses, and ensure that the state has sufficient grain, cotton, and other agricultural and sideline products. This will guarantee the supply of living necessities for urban and rural people, provide abundant raw materials for industry, and ensure the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction.

To grasp the procurement work, we must first emphasize proletarian politics. We must take "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the capitalist roaders" as the key link, mobilize the broad masses of cadres and the people, seriously study and carry out Chairman Mao's strategic line of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and resolutely carry out the state's various specific policies on taxation, procurement, distribution, and other matters.

Leaders at all levels and the broad masses of cadres must go to the front line, closely rely on the masses, and tightly link up the series of work in procurement, processing, storage, and transportation, and do it well.

The financial and commercial departments, while grasping the procurement work, must closely cooperate with the industrial and transportation departments, actively organize the delivery of industrial products to the countryside to meet the needs of the people's communes' production teams and the broad masses of commune members to increase production and improve their lives; and do a good job in recovering agricultural loans and prepayment deposits.

Against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who take advantage of the situation to create trouble, spread rumors, and incite peasants to keep more and sell less, and sabotage agricultural product procurement work, as well as the speculation and profiteering activities carried out by capitalist forces in cities and countryside, we must be highly vigilant, thoroughly expose, and resolutely strike them.

    抓紧农产品收购工作
    本报评论员
    在无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产一派大好形势下，广大贫下中农和社员群众，以主人翁的姿态，踊跃向国家交售粮食、棉花和其他农副产品。我国各地的农产品收购工作，取得了巨大的成绩。黑龙江传来捷报，全省粮食征购任务提前超额完成。入库粮食比大丰收购一九六六年增加了百分之十二。山东的棉花收购工作，进展很快。截至十二月十日，收购的棉花比去年同期增加了百分之五点四。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧。”
    今年，我国粮食、棉花和各种农副产品，普遍获得了大丰收。这是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。这是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利。我们要乘胜前进，以“只争朝夕”的精神，不失时机地抓紧粮食、棉花和其他农副产品的收购工作，完成和超额完成国家的收购任务。
    农产品的收购工作，有很强的季节性。只有抓紧收购，及时入库，妥善保管，才能使丰收的成果得到充分的利用，避免不应有的损失，才能使国家掌握足够的粮食、棉花和其他农副产品，保证城乡人民生活的供应，给工业提供丰富的原料，保证无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。
    抓紧收购工作，首先要突出无产阶级政治。要以“斗私，批修”为纲，发动广大干部和群众，认真学习和贯彻执行毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针，正确处理国家、集体、个人三方面的关系，坚决执行国家有关征收、收购、分配等各项具体政策。
    各级领导和广大干部，要深入第一线，紧紧依靠群众，把收购、加工、保管、调运等一系列工作，环环扣紧，切实做好。
    财贸部门在抓紧收的工作的同时，要和工业、交通部门密切配合，积极组织工业品下乡，以满足人民公社生产队和广大社员群众增加生产、改善生活的需要；并做好农业贷款和预购定金的回收工作。
    对于党内一小撮走资派和地、富、反、坏、右分子乘机捣乱，制造谣言，煽动农民多留少售，破坏农产品收购工作的阴谋活动，以及城乡资本主义势力所进行的投机倒把活动，我们必须百倍警惕，给予彻底揭露，坚决打击。
