	See, what kind of "cat" are landlords and rich peasants?
	Bian Baoming, Squad Leader of the Sixth Squad, Militia Company, Jiao Xie Production Brigade

	The great leader Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us, "Never forget class struggle." Yet, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is frantically dulling our class struggle consciousness, spouting the fallacy of "regardless of whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat," and stirring up a gale of "contracting production to households." He shouts that it doesn't matter whether it's a landlord or a rich peasant, as long as they can talk, speculate, make money, and catch "mice," they are "good cats." This is encouraging landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements to launch an attack on socialism and attempt a capitalist restoration.

	Are landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements truly "good cats"? Look at the facts.

	They are "good cats" of counter-revolutionary revenge. Some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, under the encouragement of the Chinese Khrushchev and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, have started to raise their heads again, which they once lowered to pretend to confess their crimes to the people, and are now engaging in counter-revolutionary revenge. A rich peasant named Shen, thinking the time has come, took back home the millstones and axles that had been returned to the collective.

	They are "good cats" of speculation and profiteering. Some landlords and rich peasants "have smooth tongues and busy feet, seeking ways to exploit and speculate." They spread capitalist ideas everywhere, advocating "if a horse doesn't eat night grass, it won't get fat; if a person doesn't get outside money, they won't get rich." They use every means to drill holes and dig eyes, engage in speculation, make money, and undermine the foundations of socialism. Under their influence, some people are momentarily confused, bewitched by capitalism, and throw socialism aside, losing their direction.

	They are "good cats" of mischief and villainy. Some openly resist reform, drag their feet at work, do sloppy work, look for easy tasks, avoid heavy work, and fight over work points without letting go. Some steal collective property, sabotage the collective economy. Some wear red clothes, disguise themselves as "good people," come out at night to steal, scare people, harm livestock, embezzle public funds, and steal without hesitation.

	Listen, biggest capitalist-roader within the Party: are these demons and monsters "good cats"? If these "good cats" are allowed to "catch" "mice" like this, wouldn't it be as Chairman Mao pointed out: "If things are done this way, it won't take much time," and "it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration," and "the whole of China will change color"? What a dangerous situation this is!

	We must raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, thoroughly criticize and expose the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party along with his fallacies of "white cats" and "black cats," and fight him down and stink him up!

    看，地主富农是什么样的“猫”？
    角斜大队民兵营第六排排长　卞宝明
    伟大的领袖毛主席一再教导我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。可是，党内另一个最大的走资派却拚命麻痹我们的阶级斗争观念，抛出“不管白猫黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫”的谬论，大刮“包产到户”的阴风。他大叫不要分“白猫”、“黑猫”的鬼话，一方面是讲搞单干、走资本主义道路能增产，它是“好猫”；另一方面也是讲不管是地主，还是富农，只要能说会道，能投机，能赚钱，能捉到“老鼠”，就是“好猫”。这是在鼓励地、富、反、坏分子向社会主义进攻，搞资本主义复辟。
    地、富、反、坏分子果真是“好猫”吗？请看事实。
    他们是反攻倒算的“好猫”。一些地、富、反、坏分子，在中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派的鼓励下，又开始抬起曾经向人民假认罪的头，搞起反攻倒算来。有个姓申的富农，以为时机已到，就把已经收归集体的磨子和车轴拿回家去。
    他们是投机倒把的“好猫”。一些地主、富农“嘴巴会讲脚头勤，投机剥削找窍门”。他们到处鼓吹资本主义，宣扬“马不吃夜草不肥，人不得外财不富”。他们千方百计锥洞挖眼，搞投机，捉活钱，挖社会主义墙脚。在他们的影响下，有的人一时弄得晕头晕脑，被资本主义迷住了心窍，而把社会主义抛到一旁，迷失了方向。
    他们是为非作歹的“好猫”。有的公开抗拒改造，上工拖，做活粗，找巧活，避重活，争工分死不松。有的偷拿集体财物，破坏集体经济。有的穿上红衣裳，装成“抹花儿”，夜里出来偷窃、吓人，伤害牲畜，有的损公肥私，贪污盗窃，无所不为。
    党内另一个最大的走资派听着：这些牛鬼蛇神，难道是“好猫”吗？如果让这些“好猫”这样去“捉”“老鼠”，岂不就要象毛主席所指出的那样：“照此办理，那就不要很多时间”，“就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟”，“整个中国就要改变颜色了”吗！这是多么危险的情景啊！
    我们要更高地举起革命的批判大旗，把党内另一个最大的走资派连同他的“白猫”、“黑猫”的鬼话批深批透，斗倒斗臭！
