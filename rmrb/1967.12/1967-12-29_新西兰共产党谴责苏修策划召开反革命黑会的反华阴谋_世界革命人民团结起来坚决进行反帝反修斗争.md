    The New Zealand Communist Party Secretariat recently issued a statement exposing and condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's plot to hold a counter-revolutionary black meeting and their anti-China criminal conspiracy. The statement, published in the December 13 issue of the weekly "Voice of the People," points out: "The Soviet leaders are trying to organize a new 'international conference' of communist parties. Their real intention in holding such a 'conference' is to attack China and assist imperialism."

    The statement says: "If they succeed in doing so, they will have done the greatest favor for U.S. imperialism."

    "However, these attempts are doomed to failure. China today has become the main bastion of socialism, national liberation, and the struggle against imperialism. For this reason, China has an irresistible appeal to the peoples of all countries who are fighting against the main enemy, U.S. imperialism."

    The statement continues: "In contrast, the Soviet leaders have long since capitulated to capitalism. They have restored profit incentives in production, and in the Soviet Union, capitalism has basically been restored. Under the deceptive slogan of 'unity against imperialism in Vietnam,' they have colluded with U.S. imperialism, attempting to force Vietnam to accept U.S. peace terms. They have armed capitalist India against socialist China and aided the fascist regime in Indonesia."

    The statement emphasizes: "Under these circumstances, any 'international conference' initiated by the Soviet Union 'can only be a conference that meekly agrees to cooperate with imperialism and betray socialist policies.' The statement says: 'This once again proves that without waging a struggle against revisionism, it is impossible to effectively strike at imperialism.'"

    The statement concludes: "Such a deceptive 'conference' cannot stop the surging revolutionary struggle of the people of the world.

    "The workers and oppressed peoples of the world are uniting under the banner of contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Neither the U.S. imperialists nor their accomplices in the Kremlin can stop this process."

    新西兰共产党谴责苏修策划召开反革命黑会的反华阴谋
    世界革命人民团结起来坚决进行反帝反修斗争
    新华社惠灵顿电　新西兰共产党书记处最近发表声明，揭露和谴责苏联修正主义领导集团策划召开反革命黑会的反华罪恶阴谋。这项刊载在十二月十三日一期的《人民之声》周报上的声明指出：“苏联领导人正努力组织一次新的各国共产党‘国际会议’。他们在这方面的真正意图是要利用这样一次‘会议’来攻击中国和帮助帝国主义。”
    声明说：“如果他们能够这样作，那将是他们为美帝国主义帮了最大的忙”。
      “但是，这些企图是注定要失败的。中国今天已经成为社会主义、民族解放和反对帝国主义的主要堡垒。正因为如此，对于正在同主要敌人美帝国主义作斗争的世界各国人民来说，中国具有不可抗拒的吸引力。”
    声明接着说：“与此相对照，苏联领导人早就投靠资本主义了。他们在生产中恢复利润刺激，在苏联基本上复辟了资本主义。他们在欺骗性的‘在越南团结反帝’的口号掩盖下，同美帝狼狈为奸，试图迫使越南接受美国的和平条件。他们武装资本主义的印度来反对社会主义的中国，并且援助印度尼西亚的法西斯政权。”
    声明强调指出：在这种情况下，任何苏联发起的“国际会议”，“只能是一个服服贴贴地同意同帝国主义合作和背叛社会主义的政策的会议。”声明说：“这再一次证明，如果不坚持进行反对修正主义的斗争，便不可能有效地打击帝国主义。”
    声明最后说：“这种骗人的‘会议’决不能够阻挡全世界日益高涨的革命斗争浪潮。
      “全世界的工人和被压迫人民正在当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的旗帜下团结起来。无论是美帝国主义者还是他们在克里姆林宫的同伙，都阻挡不了这一进程。”
