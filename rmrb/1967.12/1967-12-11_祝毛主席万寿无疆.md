    Deputy Squad Leader Li Congquan is writing a letter home. What heartfelt words should he share with his family first? This son of a poor peasant is filled with boiling blood and surging waves of emotion. At the beginning of his letter, he writes:

	Long Live Chairman Mao Forever

    The son of a poor peasant, Deputy Squad Leader Li Congquan, is not very literate and needs someone else to write his letters for him. Once, a soldier wrote a letter for him. After writing, the soldier read it aloud to him. After just two sentences, Li Congquan raised his hand, excitedly saying, “Every letter must first express our most sincere wishes for Chairman Mao, wishing him eternal life!”

    Li Congquan’s blood boils, and his emotions surge like waves. With unbridled sincere feelings, he pours out his boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to his comrades: “You know, I lost my mother when I was young, and my family was so poor we couldn’t even open the pot for a meal. The red sun rose in the east, and it was Chairman Mao who led the poor to revolt, saving me from the fire pit. Without Chairman Mao, I and millions of laboring people wouldn’t be able to live even a single day! Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. The river is deep, the sea is deep, but Chairman Mao’s kindness runs deeper.”

    He paused, wiped his moist eyes, and continued, “We have today’s happiness, but that black-hearted Chinese Khrushchev wants to restore capitalism, making us suffer twice the hardship and twice the misery. It is our great teacher Chairman Mao who personally initiated and led this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, smashing Chinese Khrushchev’s evil plots and ensuring that our socialist country remains unshakable for generations to come! With Chairman Mao, humanity has hope. With Chairman Mao, the world has a future. With Chairman Mao, we have everything. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the Chinese people and also the great savior of the world’s people. Long live Chairman Mao forever, which is our greatest happiness.”

    Li Congquan’s comrades listened carefully, their hearts never so stirred before. They poured their love for Chairman Mao into their pens, writing at the beginning of the letter in bold, powerful strokes: First, let us together wish our most red, most red red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

    副班长李从全在写家信。先把什么知心话讲给亲人呢？这个贫农的儿子热血沸腾，心潮逐浪高，在信的开头写上：
　　祝毛主席万寿无疆
    贫农的儿子、副班长李从全识字不多，要找别人代笔写信。有一次，有个战士替他写家信，写好后念给他听。刚念两句，李从全举起手，激动地说：“每封信，都要先把我们对毛主席的最最衷心的祝愿写上，祝愿他老人家万寿无疆！”
    李从全热血沸腾，心潮逐浪高，怀着难以抑制的真挚感情，向战友倾吐对毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚：“你知道啊，我从小失去了生母，家里穷的揭不开锅。东方升起红太阳，是毛主席领导穷人闹革命，救我出火坑；没有毛主席，我和千千万万的劳动人民，一天也活不成啊！爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，河深海深没有毛主席的恩情深。”
    他停了停，擦擦湿润的眼睛，继续说：“咱们有了幸福的今天，可是中国赫鲁晓夫这个黑了心肠的家伙，天天想着复辟资本主义，要咱们重吃二遍苦，再受二茬罪。是我们伟大的导师毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的罪恶阴谋，保证了我国的社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色！有了毛主席，人类的命运就有希望，有了毛主席，世界的前途就有指靠，有了毛主席，我们就有一切。毛主席是中国人民的大救星，也是世界人民的大救星，毛主席万寿无疆，就是我们最大最大的幸福。”
    李从全的战友认真听着，心情从来没有象现在这样激动，他把战士对毛主席的全部热爱，凝结在笔尖上，在信的开头写下一行刚劲有力的大字：首先，让我们共同祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
