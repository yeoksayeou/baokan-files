An Arrow Poisoned with Opposition to the Theater Revolution

Exposing the Reactionary Essence of Qi Yanming's "Three-in-One" Policy for Theater Repertoires

The former deputy minister and party secretary of the Ministry of Culture, Qi Yanming, is a key figure under the command of the biggest capitalist-roader within the party. Following the black directives of his master, he used his stolen authority to vigorously promote and advocate for imperial, feudal, and romantic old operas, paving the way for China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism.

The policy of "three-in-one" for theater repertoires, which includes modern plays, traditional plays, and so-called new historical plays, is a poisoned arrow shot by this clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists against the party, against socialism, and against the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Under the pretense of "greatly developing" modern plays, they aim to strangle revolutionary modern plays.

Whether or not to perform revolutionary modern plays is not just a matter of repertoire themes; it is a question of which class controls the stage and which class exercises dictatorship on the stage. It is a struggle between workers, peasants, and soldiers and the imperial, feudal, and romantic figures for control of the stage. It is a life-and-death struggle between two classes and two roads!

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Qi Yanming, in a "summary speech" at a meeting in the spring of 1960, vigorously advocated for the "three-in-one" policy, listing modern plays as one of the "three-in-one" and issuing a blank check for their "great development."

However, in this very "summary speech," he actually called for "some actors not to perform modern plays," advocating that the performance of modern plays should be "flexible according to the situation, the event, the genre, and the person, and not to be uniformly enforced." With one "flexible" after another, Qi Yanming attempted to use these frames and conditions to strangle revolutionary modern plays, which shows no sign of wanting to "greatly develop" revolutionary modern plays at all!

A few days later, Qi Yanming published an article titled "The Great Leap Forward in Modern-Themed Operas," viciously attacking revolutionary modern plays, claiming that "each play's script creation, performance techniques, music, and stage design still have many flaws and issues to be discussed." At the same time, he vigorously promoted traditional plays, loudly proclaiming that "currently, traditional plays are not too many but too few"; he also strongly advocated that some old artists "can completely stop performing modern plays," meaning they can "completely" perform imperial, feudal, and romantic figures. Where is the sign of "greatly developing" revolutionary modern plays?

Soon after, he concocted an article titled "Creating More Modern-Themed Operas." In the article, he "demanded the creation and adaptation of new scripts." What are these "new scripts"? A look at the content reveals that out of the five categories he listed, four are not modern-themed but are things like "excellent traditional plays," "Chinese ancient and modern historical stories," "ancient folk legends and myths," and "even foreign historical stories, novels, and plays," and so on. Under the guise of "creating more modern-themed operas," what is actually being created is a bunch of rubbish. What kind of medicine is Qi Yanming selling? Isn't it clear!

For a long time, Qi Yanming has been madly opposing revolutionary modern plays. He has been saying things like "revolutionary modern plays have no images, no life, replace reality with themes, and are actually non-realistic creation methods," "simplistic, with many slogans," "conceptual, characters cannot stand, flat, no flavor," and so on. In short, feudal old operas are all good in his eyes, but he cannot stand any revolutionary modern plays.

Even more despicable is that at the National Modern Peking Opera Observation and Performance Conference in 1964, Qi Yanming, along with Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and a few other counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, did everything in their power to sabotage, obstruct, oppose, and destroy this performance. They did not allow the revolution of Peking Opera and were very afraid of the revolution of Peking Opera. Peng Zhen publicly mocked and insulted revolutionary modern plays as "four nothings." Lu Dingyi advocated the "repetition theory," preparing to make a comeback and let imperial, feudal, and romantic figures rule the stage again. Zhou Yang promoted the "division of labor theory," saying, "Let's have a modern play performance for local operas," opposing Peking Opera performing revolutionary modern plays. Xia Yan proposed the "supplementing deficiencies theory," downgrading revolutionary modern plays to a subsidiary of old operas. Qi Yanming attacked the workers, peasants, and soldiers taking the stage as "ridiculous"! Singing in unison, the counter-revolutionary revisionists' reactionary arrogance reached its peak!

What "greatly developing modern-themed repertoires" is completely a political fraud. Even Qi Yanming himself had to admit that he proposed the "three-in-one" repertoire policy to "put an end to performing modern plays"! Qi Yanming is the executioner of revolutionary modern plays!

Vigorously promoting feudal old operas, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism

Qi Yanming's advocacy for "actively organizing, adapting, and performing excellent traditional repertoires" is an important part of his "three-in-one" repertoire policy.

He openly said: "Currently, the work in excavating, organizing, criticizing, and inheriting excellent opera traditions is still very insufficient, and we must strive in the future."

For this evil purpose, Qi Yanming used all kinds of beautiful words to make up old operas. With the backing of the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, Qi Yanming was fearless and very arrogant. China's Khrushchev said that "Huang Tianba in 'The Village of Evil Tigers' has educational significance." Qi Yanming parroted, saying: "Plays like 'The Assembly of Heroes,' 'The Butterfly Lovers,' and 'The Legend of the White Snake' praise justice and criticize injustice; 'The Yang Family Generals' show the people's wisdom, courage, and bravery, all of which can educate the people. Therefore, Marxism-Leninism and proletarian ideological education should include a very broad range, not just current socialist revolution and socialist construction themes to educate the people... Historical themes, even those unrelated to this, as long as they are harmless, ... are all beneficial to communist ideological education." Here, Qi Yanming actually included the feudal ideological content instilled by old operas within the range of "Marxism-Leninism and proletarian ideological education," saying that "all are beneficial to communist ideological education," which is truly bizarre! If we follow the logic of this counter-revolutionary revisionist, then we completely abolish the opera revolution, completely do not need to break the "four olds" and establish the "four news," and thus completely abolish the historical task of the proletarian cultural revolution. How poisonous his intentions are!

To promote traditional plays, Qi Yanming racked his brains and used all kinds of methods. In 1960, Qi Yanming initiated the so-called "bottom-digging movement" to dig out old operas that had not been performed for a long time and put them on stage one by one. In 1961, Qi Yanming proposed the reactionary slogan of "rescuing heritage" and "excavating traditions." The biggest capitalist-roader within the party said: "After watching the play, one can rest and be happy, which is good." Qi Yanming then mobilized the opera community to perform so-called "three smalls" (young male, young female, and clown) plays, letting bad plays like "Little Tomb Visiting," "Carrying the Pole," and "Blind Man Wandering the Lanterns" come out in droves. He also led the advocacy for "schools," promoting "master-apprentice" relationships, mass-producing and publishing traditional repertoires, shooting traditional opera films and opera teaching films, and promoting so-called "memorial" performances of famous old artists.... For a time, the opera community was filled with dark clouds, and bad plays like "Capturing Three Lang," "Huang's Daughter Visits the Underworld," and "Ma's Widow Opens a Shop" flooded the cities and countryside. What was even more intolerable was that in May 1962, on the 20th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," through the conspiracy of Qi Yanming and Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and a few other counter-revolutionary revisionists, they performed the traitor play "Four Generals Visit Their Mother," which was repeatedly praised by China's Khrushchev. This was a mad challenge and savage attack on Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

Qi Yanming and others vigorously promoted traditional plays, aiming to poison revolutionary people with feudal ideology, undermine and destroy the economic foundation of socialism, and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

Under the guise of "new historical plays," they use ancient stories to criticize the present, madly opposing the party and socialism

Qi Yanming vigorously advocated for so-called "new historical plays" with the aim of using them as a cover to criticize the present through ancient stories, shooting poisoned arrows at the party and socialism. This is the crux of the so-called "three-in-one" repertoire policy!

In the eyes of this clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, although feudal old operas can serve their plot of "peaceful evolution," old operas are still somewhat restricted by the original scripts and are not as direct, obvious, and powerful in coordinating with their counter-revolutionary political needs. However, so-called "new historical plays" can be freely fabricated according to their counter-revolutionary needs, using the spirits of emperors and generals to directly attack the party and socialism.

In 1959, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang personally went to Shanghai to organize the writing of the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui's Memorial," creating a black sample of anti-party and anti-socialist "new historical plays" and conducting a counter-revolutionary "pilot."

In the same November, Qi Yanming took the lead, convening Wu Han, Jian Bozan, Tian Han, Yang Han Sheng, Hou Wailu, and a group of ghosts and snakes, holding a so-called "historical play symposium." Zhou Yang also joined the battle, participating in this symposium. At the meeting, they followed the instructions of another biggest capitalist-roader within the party, deciding that Wu Han and Jian Bozan would be in charge, establishing a "historical play draft" group, and preparing to do a big job.

Under the guise of so-called "new historical plays," Wu Han's big poisonous weed "Hai Rui's Dismissal" "broke through the door." Tian Han's "Xie Yaohuan" and Meng Chao's "Li Huimang" and other big poisonous weeds also came out one after another. Another batch of anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, such as "Strong-Willed Official," "Tang King Accepts Advice," and "Sun An Dang Ben," were all dyed with the protective color of "new historical plays" and came out in droves. This group of "enemies without guns" used the guise of "clean officials" and "evil ghosts" in "new historical plays," waving the black flag of "pleading for the people," building monuments for anti-party elements, shouting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and venting their deep hatred for the party and socialism. Their counter-revolutionary arrogance was rampant.

Ironclad facts completely exposed Qi Yanming's wolfish ambition in advocating for "new historical plays"!

In September 1962, at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle." Comrades Kang Sheng and Jiang Qing also pointed out the serious problem of the rampant spread of ghost plays and bad plays to Qi Yanming and Xia Yan at this time. But these counter-revolutionary revisionists stubbornly resisted and defended themselves. Qi Yanming openly said that "ghost plays have good ghosts and bad ghosts," even saying that the emergence of ghost plays and bad plays was "the most fundamental reason for the lack of repertoires," and insisted on the reactionary stance of "excavating" old repertoires, fiercely resisting and opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the opera revolution. When Comrade Jiang Qing personally went to several units to promote and advance the creation of revolutionary modern plays, Qi Yanming and this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists conspired, paying lip service but acting against it, madly resisting and destroying, making a desperate struggle to block the advance of the historical wheel! But how can a mantis block a chariot? Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary model operas personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, such as "The Red Lantern," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Shajiabang," "The Harbor," and "The Daring Mission," after a serious struggle, bloomed the first batch of brilliant flowers of proletarian revolutionary literature and art on the opera stage, breaking through countless obstacles and emerging from the old camp of emperors and generals. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! This is the great victory of the literary and artistic revolution! It announces the complete failure of Qi Yanming's so-called "three-in-one" repertoire policy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line."

The opera stage is a reflection and a component of political life. It is either the dictatorship of the proletariat or the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The ideology of the proletariat and the ideology of the bourgeoisie and feudal classes cannot coexist; one must overthrow the other! We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, forever drive out emperors and generals and romantic figures from the stage, forever let workers, peasants, and soldiers occupy the stage! Turn the inverted history back to its rightful place!

    一支反对戏曲革命的大毒箭
    ——揭穿齐燕铭的“三者并举”剧目方针的反动实质
    龙闻善
    旧文化部副部长、党组书记齐燕铭，是党内最大的走资派“麾下”的一员干将。他秉承主子的黑指示，利用窃取的职权，极力鼓吹宣扬帝王将相、才子佳人的封建旧戏曲，为中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    齐燕铭伙同周扬炮制的现代戏、传统戏和所谓新编历史剧“三者并举”的戏曲剧目方针，就是这一小撮反革命修正主义分子反党、反社会主义、反对无产阶级专政的一支大毒箭！
        假“大力发展”现代戏之名，行
    扼杀革命现代戏之实
    演不演革命现代戏，这决不只是一个剧目题材的问题，而是由哪个阶级占领舞台，哪个阶级在舞台上实行专政的问题；是工农兵与帝王将相、才子佳人争夺舞台阵地的斗争；是两个阶级、两条道路你死我活的大搏斗！
    反革命修正主义分子齐燕铭，在一九六○年春天的一次会议上抛出了一个“总结发言”，大肆鼓吹“三者并举”，把现代戏列为“并举”之一，还开给了一张“大力发展”的空头支票。
    但是，就在这个“总结发言”中，他竟然号召“有些演员可以不演现代戏”，提出演不演现代戏要“因地制宜，因事制宜，因剧种制宜，因人制宜，不要强求一律”。左一个“制宜”，右一个“制宜”，齐燕铭妄图用这些框框条条把革命的现代戏置于死地，这哪里有半点要“大力发展”革命现代戏的影子！
    几天之后，齐燕铭又抛出了一篇文章叫做《现代题材戏曲的大跃进》的文章，恶毒攻击革命的现代戏，说什么“每个剧的剧本创作、表演技术、音乐、舞台美术看来，也还有许多缺点和可以研讨的问题”。同时又拚命鼓吹传统戏，大肆叫嚷：“目前传统戏不是太多，而是太少了”；还极力鼓吹有些老艺人“可以完全不再去演现代剧目”，也就是可以“完全”去演帝王将相、才子佳人。这哪里有半点“大力发展”革命现代戏的影子！
    紧接着，他又炮制了一篇题为《多多创作现代题材的戏曲》。他在文章中，“要求多多创作和改编新的剧本”。所谓“新的剧本”是什么东西呢？一查内容，他所列举的五大类中的四大类，根本不是现代题材，而是什么“传统优秀剧目”，“中国古代的和近代的历史故事”，“古代的民间传说、神话”，“甚至外国的历史故事、小说、戏剧”等等。美其名曰“多多创作现代题材的戏曲”，其实“多多”创作的却是那些乌七八糟的东西。齐燕铭葫芦里卖的什么药，不是很清楚了吗！
    长期以来，齐燕铭一直疯狂反对革命现代戏。胡说什么革命现代戏“没有形象，没有生活，以主题代替现实，实际上是非现实主义的创作方法”呀，什么“简单化，标语口号多……”呀，什么“从概念出发，人物立不起来，平面，没有味道”呀，等等，等等。总之，封建旧戏曲在他看来统统好得很，革命现代戏他却一个也看不顺眼。
    尤其令人发指的是，在一九六四年全国京剧现代戏观摩演出大会上，齐燕铭伙同彭真、陆定一、周扬、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在党内最大的走资派的支持下，对这次演出极尽抵制、阻挠、反对、破坏之能事。他们不许京剧革命，十分害怕京剧革命。彭真公开嘲笑辱骂革命现代戏“四不象”。陆定一鼓吹“反复”论，准备卷土重来，让帝王将相、才子佳人重新统治舞台。周扬宣扬“分工”论，说“搞个地方剧种的现代戏会演吧”，反对京剧演革命现代戏。夏衍抛出了“补不足”论，把革命现代戏贬为旧戏曲的附庸。齐燕铭则攻击工农兵登上舞台“令人有滑稽之感”！一唱一和，这伙反革命修正主义分子的反动气焰嚣张到了极点！
    什么“大力发展现代题材的剧目”，完全是一个政治骗局。连齐燕铭自己也不得不招认，他提出“三者并举”的剧目方针，是为了要把演现代戏“告一个结束”！齐燕铭是扼杀革命现代戏的刽子手！
        大肆鼓吹封建旧戏曲，为资本主
    义复辟大造舆论
    齐燕铭鼓吹“积极整理改编和上演优秀传统剧目”，是他的“三者并举”剧目方针的一个重要组成部分。
    他公开说：“目前在发掘整理、批判继承优秀的戏曲传统遗产方面的工作也还是做得很不够的，今后必须努力。”
    为了这个罪恶的目的，齐燕铭用尽了一切美丽的词句，来为旧戏曲涂脂抹粉。由于有党内最大的走资派撑腰，齐燕铭有恃无恐，非常嚣张。中国赫鲁晓夫说“《恶虎村》里的黄天霸有教育意义”。齐燕铭也鹦鹉学舌说：《群英会》、《梁山伯与祝英台》、《白蛇传》等“是表扬正义的一面，批判非正义的一面；《杨家将》表现人民的聪明、智慧、勇敢，都可以教育人民。所以马列主义、无产阶级思想教育，应该包括的范围非常广，不是仅仅讲当前的社会主义革命、社会主义建设的题材才能教育人民……历史题材的，甚至与这个无关的，只要是无害的，……都是对共产主义思想教育有好处的”。这里，齐燕铭竟把旧戏曲所灌输的封建主义的思想内容，都包括在“马列主义、无产阶级思想教育”的范围之内，说什么“都是对共产主义思想教育有好处的”，真是咄咄怪事！如果按照这个反革命修正主义分子的逻辑办事，就根本取消了戏曲革命，根本用不着破“四旧”，立“四新”，也就根本取消了无产阶级文化大革命的历史任务。用心何其毒也！
    为了大搞传统戏，齐燕铭挖空心思，用尽了各种手法。一九六○年，齐燕铭发起所谓“翻箱底运动”把久已不演的旧戏曲，一个一个挖出来上演。一九六一年，齐燕铭又提出“抢救遗产”“挖掘传统”的反动口号。党内最大的走资派说：“看了戏，能得到休息，使人高兴，就很好。”齐燕铭就动员戏曲界大演所谓“三小”（小生、小旦、小丑）戏，让《小上坟》、《打杠子》、《瞎子逛灯》之类的坏戏纷纷出笼。他还带头提倡“流派”，大搞“拜师收徒”，大量编印出版传统剧目，大拍传统剧目的戏曲片和戏曲教学影片，大搞美化名老艺人的所谓“纪念”性演出……。一时，戏曲界乌云翻滚，什么《活捉三郎》、《黄氏女游阴》、《马寡妇开店》等等鬼戏、坏戏，泛滥城乡。尤其不能令人容忍的是，在一九六二年五月，毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年的时候，经过齐燕铭和周扬、林默涵等一小撮反革命修正主义分子的密谋，竟上演了中国赫鲁晓夫一再赞赏的叛徒戏《四郎探母》。这是对毛主席的革命文艺路线的疯狂挑衅和猖狂进攻。
    齐燕铭等大搞传统戏，目的就是拿封建主义的意识形态，来毒害革命人民，瓦解和破坏社会主义的经济基础，为资本主义复辟制造舆论。
        在“新编历史剧”的幌子下，借
    古讽今，猖狂反党反社会主义
    齐燕铭所以大力提倡所谓“新编历史剧”，目的是利用它作为幌子，借古讽今，含沙射影，射出一支又一支的反党反社会主义的毒箭。这正是所谓“三者并举”剧目方针的要害！
    在这一小撮反革命修正主义分子看来，封建旧戏曲虽然可以为他们“和平演变”的阴谋服务，但是，旧戏曲多少总要受到原有剧本的限制，有时在配合他们的反革命政治需要上不那么直接、明显、有力。而所谓“新编历史剧”，则可以按照他们的反革命需要，借用帝王将相的亡灵，随心所欲地任意编造，便于他们更直接地向党向社会主义进攻。
    一九五九年，反革命修正主义分子周扬，亲自跑到上海去组织编写大毒草《海瑞上疏》，炮制了这块反党反社会主义的“新编历史剧”的黑样板，进行了一次反革命的“试点”。
    同年十一月，齐燕铭出面主持，召集吴晗、翦伯赞、田汉、阳翰笙、侯外庐等一群牛鬼蛇神，开了一个所谓“历史剧座谈会”。周扬也赤膊上阵，参加了这次座谈会。会上，他们秉承党内另一个最大的走资派的意旨，决定由吴晗、翦伯赞负责，成立“历史剧拟目”小组，摩拳擦掌地准备大干一场。
    在这个所谓“新编历史剧”的幌子下，吴晗的大毒草《海瑞罢官》“破门而出”了。田汉的《谢瑶环》、孟超的《李慧娘》等大毒草，也相继出笼了。另一批反党反社会主义的毒草，如《强项令》、《唐王纳谏》、《孙安动本》等等，都涂上了“新编历史剧”的保护色，纷纷出笼。这一小撮“不拿枪的敌人”，在“新编历史剧”中，托身“清官”，寄命“厉鬼”，打起“为民请命”的黑旗，为反党分子树碑立传，叫嚷要拿鬼魂来“激励生人”，咬牙切齿地发泄对党对社会主义的刻骨仇恨，公然号召要颠覆无产阶级专政。他们的反革命气焰，甚嚣尘上。
    铁的事实，完全暴露了齐燕铭所以提倡“新编历史剧”的狼子野心！
    一九六二年九月，在党的八届十中全会上，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召。康生同志、江青同志也在这个时候，向齐燕铭、夏衍等严正地指出了鬼戏、坏戏泛滥的严重问题。但这些反革命修正主义分子，却极力抵赖，负隅顽抗。齐燕铭公然说什么“鬼戏有好鬼、坏鬼之分”，甚至说鬼戏、坏戏的出笼，“最根本的原因是剧目贫乏”，而且坚持“挖掘”旧剧目的反动主张，拚命抵制和反对毛主席的革命路线，反对戏曲革命。当江青同志亲自到几个单位去推动和促进革命现代戏的创作的时候，齐燕铭等这一小撮反革命修正主义分子又互相勾结，阳奉阴违，疯狂地进行抵制、破坏，进行垂死挣扎，妄图阻挡历史车轮的前进！但是，螳臂岂能挡车，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，江青同志亲自培育的《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《沙家浜》、《海港》、《奇袭白虎团》等一个个革命样板戏，经过严重的斗争，在戏曲舞台上开放出第一批无产阶级革命文艺的鲜艳花朵，让京剧这个古老的艺术，冲破重重阻力，从帝王将相、才子佳人的旧营垒中杀了出来。这是毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利！这是文艺革命的伟大胜利！它宣告了齐燕铭等的所谓“三者并举”剧目方针的彻底破产。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”
    戏曲舞台，是政治生活的反映和一个组成部分。不是无产阶级专政，就是资产阶级专政。无产阶级的意识形态和资产阶级、封建阶级的意识形态，不是你打倒我，就是我打倒你，根本不可能“并举”！我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决贯彻毛主席的革命文艺路线，永远把帝王将相、才子佳人赶出舞台，永远让工农兵占领舞台！把被颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来！
