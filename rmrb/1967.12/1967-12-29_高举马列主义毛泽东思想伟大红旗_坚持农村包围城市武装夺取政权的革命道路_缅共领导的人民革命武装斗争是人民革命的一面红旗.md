The Burmese Communist Party, led by Comrade Thakin Than Tun, has been holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, persisting in the revolutionary path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by armed struggle. For nearly twenty years, it has led the Burmese people in revolutionary armed struggle, accumulating and developing revolutionary forces, and striking heavy blows at the reactionary rule of imperialism and its lackeys in Burma. The history of the Burmese armed struggle is a history of the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is also a history that proves that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth applicable everywhere.

The brilliant victories of the Burmese people's revolutionary armed struggle have greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and dealt a severe blow to the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Burmese reactionaries.

The revolutionary armed struggle under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party has gone through the Anti-Japanese War and nearly twenty years of domestic revolutionary war. Within the Burmese Communist Party, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines over whether to persist in the revolutionary path of seizing political power by armed struggle or to follow the "peaceful transition." The Burmese Communist Party, led by Comrade Thakin Than Tun, has been holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and has been waging a resolute struggle against the revisionists within the party, ensuring that the proletarian revolutionary line has won a decisive victory within the Burmese Communist Party and guaranteeing the victorious advance of the Burmese people's revolutionary armed struggle.

After the end of the Second World War, the Burmese Communist Party waged a resolute struggle against the international revisionism of the White Laborites and the Indian Communist Party's revisionism, which advocated the "parliamentary road." In March 1948, the Burmese reactionaries launched a counter-revolutionary civil war against the communists and the people. The Burmese Communist Party, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, took the revolutionary path of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by armed struggle, successfully achieving the revolutionary transition from the cities to the countryside and from peaceful struggle to armed struggle. In April of the same year, Comrade Thakin Than Tun called on the entire party to study "Mao Zedong's theory."

Under the leadership of Comrade Thakin Than Tun, the Burmese Communist Party, while persisting in armed struggle, continued to wage a long-term, irreconcilable struggle against various opportunists and revisionists within the party and internationally. It withstood the pressure from the Soviet revisionist leadership and the Chinese revisionists like Khrushchev, overcame the "left" and "right" opportunism within the party, and in 1964, formulated the revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing political power." This was a great victory for the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought revolutionary line within the Burmese Communist Party.

In 1967, the Central Political Bureau of the Burmese Communist Party passed a resolution, solemnly declaring: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the leader of the world proletariat," "Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism and communism are heading towards global victory. It is necessary to clearly accept that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism in our era." "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all revolutionary work in Burma, especially Mao Zedong's theories on building a proletarian party, building a proletarian army, and people's war, which are the guiding lights for the victory of the Burmese revolution."

At the same time, the Burmese Communist Party, holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, achieved a great victory in the struggle to thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of 1955 in 1967 and smashed the Shwe-Thaikhin revisionist clique.

Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Burmese Communist Party has implemented the policy of self-reliance, persisted in nearly twenty years of protracted domestic revolutionary war, and fought its way to victory through the long-term counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Burmese reactionaries. It has achieved one victory after another in building the people's army, mobilizing and organizing the masses, consolidating and expanding the base areas, and in military affairs. Currently, the revolutionary situation in Burma is excellent.

The great leader Chairman Mao said: "Without a people's army, there is nothing." In the long-term revolutionary war, the Burmese Communist Party has vigorously built and developed the people's armed forces, promoting the revolutionization and combat readiness of the people's armed forces. Since 1964, the Burmese Communist Party has launched an unprecedented high tide of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought throughout the party and the army. The Burmese Communist Party has opened various study classes in the base areas, using Chairman Mao's works and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's exposition of Chairman Mao's military thought, "Long Live the Victory of People's War," as the main textbooks to study politics and military affairs. In April this year, the Propaganda Department of the Burmese Communist Party translated and published Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Three Articles," as a weapon for the entire party members and revolutionary fighters to educate themselves and promote thought revolutionization. It also launched a mass campaign to criticize "Self-Cultivation." The Burmese Communist Party also launched a "bitterness education" movement within the people's armed forces to raise the class consciousness of revolutionary fighters, conducted "three great democracies" education, and issued the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" personally formulated by Chairman Mao for the Chinese People's Liberation Army, requiring all fighters of the people's armed forces to strictly follow them. The proletarian military line has also won continuous victories in the struggle against the bourgeois military line. Chairman Mao's military thought and strategic and tactical thought have been playing a role in the Burmese people's war, making the Burmese people's revolutionary armed struggle flourish.

The strength of the Burmese people's armed forces is growing. In 1966, the people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party expanded by 50% compared to 1965, and more regions have established militias.

The great leader Chairman Mao taught: "The armed struggle of the Chinese Communist Party is a peasant war under the leadership of the proletariat." "It is necessary to turn the backward countryside into an advanced and consolidated base area ... to gradually win the complete victory of the revolution in a long-term struggle." For more than a decade, the Burmese Communist Party has vigorously mobilized and organized the peasants. Since 1964, the Burmese Communist Party has more actively mobilized the masses, launching a magnificent struggle to demand the increase of rice purchase prices and resist procurement in vast rural areas, and this year, it led the broad masses of urban and rural areas to launch a massive anti-hunger struggle. The people's armed forces also led the people to carry out struggles to eliminate traitors and local tyrants and to carry out land reform where possible. In these struggles, the people's armed forces established the party's core, established various mass organizations, armed the masses, and established people's political power. These mass struggles, which have been launched one after another in recent years, have strongly supported the struggle of the people's armed forces, making the people's armed forces and revolutionary base areas develop and consolidate day by day. Now, the guerrilla base areas of the Burmese people's armed forces are spread throughout the east, south, west, and north of Burma, forming a surrounding situation against the Ne Win reactionary government.

The Burmese people's armed forces, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "accumulating strength through guerrilla warfare" and "taking the annihilation of the enemy's effective forces as the main target," are widely carrying out guerrilla warfare and annihilating more and more enemies. In 1965, the Burmese people's armed forces annihilated 469 enemies. In 1966, in the delta region of the Myeik District alone, the people's armed forces annihilated 107 enemies. This year, the number of enemies annihilated by the people's armed forces has increased significantly. On January 17, in an ambush on the Yangon-Mandalay highway, the Burmese people's armed forces wiped out a 70-person team of the Ne Win reactionary army's Fifth Battalion, annihilating 29 enemies. On July 11, the people's armed forces completely annihilated a platoon of the enemy's Fifty-Fifth Battalion on the Dawei-Pakokku highway, annihilating 20 enemies and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition.

The Burmese people's armed forces have smashed the Ne Win reactionary government's repeated "focused encirclement and suppression" this year, achieving great victories. Now, the Burmese people's armed forces are widely carrying out guerrilla warfare, not only in all regions of Lower Burma but also in Upper Burma, where victories are frequently reported. The people's armed forces are ambushing the enemy everywhere, attacking the enemy's strongholds, cities, and train stations, destroying railways, blowing up bridges, making the Ne Win reactionary army passive and suffering heavy losses, and causing great panic.

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The united front, armed struggle, and party building are the three magic weapons with which the Chinese Communist Party has defeated the enemy in the Chinese revolution." While waging armed struggle, the Burmese Communist Party has consolidated and developed the united front with various minority nationalities' armed forces within the country that oppose American imperialism and the Ne Win reactionary government. In 1959, the Burmese Communist Party established the National Democratic United Front with the Karen National Union, the New Mon State Party, the Kayah Progressive Party, and the Chin National Council, and further strengthened the cooperation with other revolutionary minority nationalities' armed forces, further strengthening the unity of the Burmese people of all nationalities in the revolutionary struggle and smashing the conspiracy of American imperialism and the Ne Win reactionary government to split the unity between the Burmese Communist Party and various revolutionary minority nationalities' armed forces. The people's armed forces of the Burmese Communist Party are fighting side by side with the armed forces of various minority nationalities, supporting each other, and are fiercely attacking the reactionary rule of imperialism and its lackey, the Ne Win military government.

Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress. Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people's revolutionary armed struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party is advancing towards victory and has become a red banner for the people's revolutionary war in colonial and semi-colonial countries. The Burmese Communist Party, led by Comrade Thakin Than Tun, is holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, persisting in the revolutionary line of "winning the war and seizing political power," leading the Burmese people, and will certainly overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, achieve a thorough victory in the revolutionary war through long-term struggle.

    高举马列主义毛泽东思想伟大红旗  坚持农村包围城市武装夺取政权的革命道路
    缅共领导的人民革命武装斗争是人民革命的一面红旗
    新华社二十八日讯　本社记者报道：以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的革命道路，领导缅甸人民进行了将近二十年的革命武装斗争，积聚和发展了革命力量，沉重地打击了帝国主义及其走狗在缅甸的反动统治。缅甸武装斗争的历史，是伟大的毛泽东思想取得胜利的历史，也是证明毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理的历史。
    缅甸人民革命武装斗争的光辉胜利，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和缅甸反动派的威风。
    缅甸共产党领导下的革命武装斗争，经历了抗日战争和将近二十年的国内革命战争。在缅甸共产党内，围绕是坚持武装夺取政权的革命道路还是“和平过渡”，一直进行着两条路线的尖锐斗争。以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同党内的修正主义进行了坚决的斗争，保证了无产阶级革命路线在缅甸共产党内取得决定性的胜利，保证了缅甸人民革命武装斗争的胜利前进。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，缅甸共产党就同国际上的白劳德修正主义，宣扬“议会道路”的印共修正主义进行了坚决的斗争。一九四八年三月，缅甸反动派发动了反共反人民的内战，缅甸共产党就按照毛主席的教导，走农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的革命道路，胜利地实现了从城市转入农村，从和平斗争转入武装斗争的革命转变。同年四月，德钦丹东同志又号召全党学习“毛泽东的理论”。
    缅甸共产党在德钦丹东同志的领导下，在坚持武装斗争的同时，继续同国际上和缅共党内形形色色的机会主义、修正主义进行了长期的不调和的斗争，顶住了国际上苏联修正主义领导集团和中国赫鲁晓夫之流的压力，克服了党内的“左”右倾机会主义，在一九六四年制定了“赢得战争、夺取政权”的革命路线。这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线在缅共党内的伟大胜利。
    一九六七年，缅甸共产党中央政治局又通过决议，庄严地宣布：“毛泽东同志是世界无产阶级的领袖”，“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义、共产主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义，必须明确地接受毛泽东思想是我们时代的马克思列宁主义的顶峰。”“毛泽东思想是缅甸一切革命工作的指导方针，特别是毛泽东同志关于建设无产阶级政党、建设无产阶级军队和人民战争的理论，更是缅甸革命取得胜利的指路明灯。”
    与此同时，缅甸共产党高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在一九六七年，又在彻底批判一九五五年修正主义路线的斗争中取得了伟大胜利，并且粉碎了盛—本修正主义集团。
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，缅甸共产党实行自力更生的方针，坚持了将近二十年的持久的国内革命战争，从帝国主义、现代修正主义和缅甸反动派的长期反革命“围剿”中，杀出了一条走向胜利的光明大道，在建设人民军队、发动和组织群众、巩固扩大根据地，以及在军事上都取得了一个又一个重大的胜利。目前，缅甸的革命形势一片大好。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”缅甸共产党在长期的革命战争中，大力建设和发展人民武装，促进人民武装的革命化、战斗化。从一九六四年以来，缅甸共产党在全党全军掀起了一个史无前例的大学大用毛泽东思想的高潮。缅共在根据地开办各种学习班，以毛主席著作和林彪副主席阐述毛主席军事思想的《人民战争胜利万岁》作为主要教材，学政治，学军事。今年四月，缅共中央宣传部翻译和出版了毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，作为全体党员和革命战士进行自我教育和促进思想革命化的武器，并发动广大党员和战士狠批《修养》。缅甸共产党还在人民武装内部开展了提高革命战士阶级觉悟的“诉苦”运动，开展“三大民主”的教育，同时发表了毛主席亲自制定的中国人民解放军的“三大纪律、八项注意”，要求全体人民武装战士认真执行。无产阶级军事路线在同资产阶级军事路线的斗争中，也不断取得了胜利。毛主席的建军思想和战略战术思想已在缅甸的人民战争中发挥出威力，使缅甸人民革命武装斗争蓬勃发展。
    缅甸人民武装的力量正在不断壮大。一九六六年，缅共领导的人民武装比一九六五年扩大了百分之五十，并且已经有更多的地区建立起民兵。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“中国共产党的武装斗争，就是在无产阶级领导之下的农民战争。”“必须把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地，……借以在长期战斗中逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。”缅甸共产党十多年来大力发动和组织农民。从一九六四年以来，缅甸共产党更加放手地发动群众，在广大农村中轰轰烈烈地开展了要求提高大米收购价格和抗征购的斗争，今年又领导城乡广大人民开展了规模巨大的反饥饿斗争。人民武装还发动人民进行锄奸反霸的斗争，并在可能的地区进行土地改革。在这些斗争中，人民武装在各地建立了党的核心，建立了各种群众组织，武装了群众，建立了人民政权。这些胜利开展的群众斗争，几年来一浪高过一浪，有力地支援了人民武装的斗争，使人民武装和革命根据地一天比一天发展和巩固起来。现在，缅甸人民武装的游击根据地遍布缅甸的东南西北，用广泛的游击战争对奈温反动政府形成了包围的形势。
    缅甸人民武装根据毛主席的“经过游击战争，积蓄力量”、“以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标”的教导，广泛开展游击战，正歼灭越来越多的敌人。在一九六五年，缅甸人民武装消灭敌人四百六十九人。在一九六六年，仅仅在三角洲的渺?县，人民武装就消灭敌人一百零七人。今年人民武装歼灭敌人的数字又有很大的增加。今年一月十七日，缅甸人民武装在仰光—曼德勒公路上的一次伏击中，就打垮奈温反动军队第五营的一支七十人的队伍，消灭敌人二十九人。七月十一日，人民武装在东坞—包康公路上，又全歼敌军第五十五营的一个排，消灭敌人二十人，并缴获大批武器和弹药。
    缅甸人民武装今年多次粉碎了奈温反动政府发动的重点“围剿”，取得了很大的胜利。现在，缅甸人民武装广泛开展游击战，不仅遍及下缅甸的所有地区，而且在上缅甸地区也捷报频传。人民武装到处伏击敌人，袭击敌人的据点、城市和火车站，破坏铁路，炸毁桥梁，使奈温反动军队到处被动挨打，惊慌万分。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“统一战线，武装斗争，党的建设，是中国共产党在中国革命中战胜敌人的三个法宝”。缅甸共产党在进行武装斗争的同时，巩固和发展了同国内反对美帝国主义和奈温反动政府的各少数民族武装的统一战线。缅甸共产党在一九五九年同克伦族团结党、新孟邦党、克耶族进步党、钦族最高委员会建立了民族民主团结阵线，并同其他革命的少数民族武装增进了合作关系，进一步加强了缅甸各族人民在革命斗争中的团结，粉碎了美帝国主义和奈温反动政府妄图分化缅甸共产党同各个革命的少数民族武装的团结的阴谋。缅共人民武装同各少数民族武装并肩战斗，互相支援，正猛烈地冲击着帝国主义及其走狗奈温军人政府的反动统治。
    毛泽东思想是历史前进的火车头。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，缅甸共产党领导的人民革命武装斗争，正在胜利前进，成为殖民地、半殖民地人民进行人民革命战争的一面红旗。以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持“赢得战争、夺取政权”的革命路线，领导缅甸人民，必将克服前进道路上的一切困难，通过长期的斗争，夺取革命战争的彻底胜利。（附图片）
