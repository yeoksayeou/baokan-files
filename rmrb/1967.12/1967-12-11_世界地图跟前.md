In the process of achieving revolutionary unity, some Red Guards still have a "small hill" in their minds. How can we, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, guide the petty-bourgeois thoughts in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution? Li Wenzhong led the young revolutionaries to stand in front of the world map.

The call to arms for revolutionary unity has sounded. At this time, Li Wenzhong was conducting military training at the first middle school in his garrison. Although the Red Guards of the twelfth grade, class three, where Li Wenzhong was, had united organizationally, their thoughts had not yet fully united. This matter was always on Li Wenzhong's mind: he should help them see the bigger picture and come down from their narrow "small hill."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois thoughts in our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the success of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

"Chairman Mao's instructions, I will carry them out!"

After dinner, Li Wenzhong called the young revolutionaries together and stood them in front of an ordinary world map. Li Wenzhong asked everyone, "Comrades, what do you think of when you see the world map?"

Li Wenzhong's hand moved across the map. He said solemnly, "Comrades, we should stand in front of the map and think of the whole world! Today, there are still many oppressed people in the world suffering under brutal exploitation and oppression. In Asia, in Africa, in the Americas, the butcher's knives of American imperialism and the reactionaries are slaughtering our class brothers; in the Soviet Union, the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique have betrayed Marxism-Leninism, pushing the Soviet people back into the abyss of capitalism..." Li Wenzhong's earnest words struck a chord in the hearts of the young revolutionaries. They felt as if they were seeing the map for the first time. At this moment, the great leader Chairman Mao's earnest teachings echoed like thunder in their ears: "The proletariat not only must liberate itself, but also must liberate all mankind. If it cannot liberate all mankind, the proletariat itself cannot finally be liberated."

An ordinary world map took the young revolutionaries' hearts to the vast five continents and four seas. To plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on every inch of land in the world, what a heavy burden they carry! Chairman Mao's teachings dispelled the fog in their hearts, and the "small hill" that had obscured their vision for many days now seemed so insignificant!

　　世界地图跟前
    革命大联合的战斗号角吹响了。
    这时，李文忠正在驻地第一中学搞军训。李文忠所在的十二级三班的红卫兵革命小将，虽然从组织上联合了，但是思想上还没有完全联合起来。这事，李文忠一直惦记在心上：应该帮助他们高瞻远瞩，从狭隘的“小山头”上走下来。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”
      “毛主席指示我照办”！
    李文忠吃过晚饭，把革命小将们叫到了一块，站在一张普通的世界地图跟前。李文忠问大家：“同学们看到了世界地图，都想到了什么？”
    李文忠的手指在地图上挥动，他严肃地说：“同学们，我们应该站在地图前，想到全世界！今天，世界上还有多少劳苦人民没有解放，正在水深火热之中受着残酷的压迫和剥削。在亚洲，在非洲，在美洲，美帝国主义和反动派的屠刀正在残杀着我们的阶级兄弟；在苏联，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流背叛了马克思列宁主义，把苏联人民重新推进了资本主义的深渊……”李文忠语重心长的几句话，重重地扣动着小将们的心弦。他们觉得好象第一次看见这张地图一样。这时，伟大领袖毛主席的谆谆教导，象春雷一样震响在小将们的耳旁：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”
    一张普通的世界地图，把小将们的心带往广阔的五洲四海。要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗，插遍全世界每一寸土地，自己肩负的担子多么重啊！毛主席的教导驱散了他们心头的迷雾，多日来遮住自己视线的“小山头”此刻显得何等渺小啊！
