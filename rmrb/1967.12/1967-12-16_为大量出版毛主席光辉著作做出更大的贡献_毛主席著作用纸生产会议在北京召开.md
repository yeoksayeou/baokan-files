The first national conference on the production of paper for Chairman Mao's works was recently held in Beijing. The conference called on the revolutionary workers in the paper industry to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, further implement the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and strive to complete and overfulfill this year's production tasks, and produce more and better paper for Chairman Mao's works for next year.

This conference was held at a time when the situation in the paper industry is excellent. Representatives from all over the country reported with great enthusiasm the tremendous achievements in the production of paper for Chairman Mao's works. From January to September this year, the national production of paper for Chairman Mao's works (letterpress paper) has exceeded last year's total production, approximately 1.6 times that of the same period last year. The regions and units that can produce paper for Chairman Mao's works have increased from 18 paper mills in 15 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in 1966 to 105 paper mills in 27 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. This has ensured the mass publication of Chairman Mao's works this year.

The representatives attending the conference unanimously agreed that the above achievements were made because the revolutionary workers in the paper industry listened to Chairman Mao's words and acted according to his instructions, grasping the revolution and promoting production. During the conference, the representatives seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspections of North China, Central South China, and East China. Everyone expressed that they would definitely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, word for word and letter for letter, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution, promote the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and do a good job in the revolutionary criticism and rectification of their own units, making greater achievements in the struggle to grasp the revolution and promote production.

Representatives from Hebei Wuan Paper Mill and Sichuan Yibin Paper Mill shared their experiences in grasping the revolution and promoting production, which greatly inspired the attendees.

The conference also discussed the issues of improving the quality of paper for Chairman Mao's works and expanding new varieties. It was agreed that the thin letterpress paper produced by Shandong Huangtai Paper Mill, Shanghai Xinhua Paper Mill, and Beijing Paper Mill has high durability and water resistance, making it very suitable for printing the widely needed 64-page bound edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the small-sized "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Therefore, all paper mills with conditions should mass-produce this type of paper next year.

The conference also discussed the production plan for paper for Chairman Mao's works for next year. The representatives attending the conference unanimously expressed that they would, together with the revolutionary workers in the paper industry across the country, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp the revolution, promote production, carry out technological innovation activities, and strive to achieve greater development in the paper industry in terms of production, quality, and variety next year, making new and greater contributions to the mass publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant works.

　　为大量出版毛主席光辉著作做出更大的贡献
    毛主席著作用纸生产会议在北京召开
    新华社十五日讯　全国第一次毛主席著作用纸生产会议，最近在北京召开。会议号召造纸工业战线上的广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，进一步贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针，为完成和超额完成今年的生产任务，并为明年生产更多、更好的毛主席著作用纸而奋斗。
    这次会议是在造纸工业战线形势大好的情况下召开的。会上，来自全国各地的革命职工代表，以十分兴奋的心情，汇报了毛主席著作用纸生产取得的巨大成绩。今年一月至九月，全国生产的毛主席著作用纸（凸版纸），已超过去年全年的总产量，约为去年同期的一点六倍。能够生产毛主席著作用纸的地区和单位，一九六六年只有十五个省、市、自治区的十八个纸厂，现在已经发展到二十七个省、市、自治区的一百零五个纸厂。从而保证了今年内毛主席著作的大量出版。
    出席会议的代表一致认为，上述成绩的取得，是造纸工业战线广大革命职工，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，抓革命、促生产的结果。会议期间，代表们认真学习了毛主席在视察华北、中南、华东地区时所作的一系列最新指示。大家表示：对毛主席的最新指示，一定坚决执行，句句照办，字字照办，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，巩固和发展革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合，搞好革命大批判和本单位的斗批改，在抓革命、促生产的斗争中作出更大的成绩。
    河北武安造纸厂、四川宜宾造纸厂等单位的代表，在会上分别介绍了抓革命、促生产的经验，使到会代表受到很大启发。
    会议还研究了提高毛主席著作用纸质量和扩大新品种的问题。大家认为，山东黄台纸厂、上海新华纸厂、北京造纸厂等单位，试制成功的薄型凸版纸有较高的耐用强度和抗水性能，对印刷广大工农兵大量需要的六十四开《毛泽东选集》合订本和小开本《毛主席语录》十分适用，因此，凡有条件的纸厂，明年都必须大量推广试制。
    有关明年毛主席著作用纸的生产计划问题，会议也作了研究。到会代表一致表示：要和全国造纸工业战线上的广大革命职工一道，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，开展技术革新活动，争取明年造纸工业不论在产量、质量和品种方面都有更大的发展，为大印特印毛主席的光辉著作做出新的更大的贡献。
