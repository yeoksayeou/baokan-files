The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, propels the wheel of history forward.

“Where Chairman Mao loves, I love; where Chairman Mao supports, I support;
Where Chairman Mao points, I follow; where Chairman Mao waves, I march forward.”
This is the resolute vow of Li Wenzhong, the heroic soldier of the Mao era, and his comrades in the Fourth Platoon, amidst the stormy Cultural Revolution. It is the shared aspiration of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, and it is the strongest voice of the times.

Li Wenzhong is a platoon leader in the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the 601st Division. He sacrificed his young life to rescue fallen Red Guards and revolutionary masses in the Gan River, dedicating himself to the great revolution that determines the fate of China and humanity.

Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the conferring of the honorable title of "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" upon Li Wenzhong.

The heroic deeds of Li Wenzhong, from the first revolutionary base personally established by Chairman Mao at Jingan Mountain, have spread throughout China and to the world.

An activity to learn from heroes, follow the heroic path, and create heroic achievements is vigorously unfolding across the country. Countless revolutionary masses of the proletariat, Red Guards, and revolutionary people solemnly vow to inherit the heroic spirit and turn the will of the hero into a grand blueprint. They take Li Wenzhong as their example, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Many international friends cheer and take pride in the appearance of a revolutionary hero nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought in the world revolutionary base. Comrades from Albania say: With heroes like Li Wenzhong, China will never change color, and the world revolution has the most reliable successors. Comrades from Ceylon wrote in the guestbook of the Li Wenzhong exhibition: "Li Wenzhong is a shining example for the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao, a Heart for Supporting the Left and Loving the People

“Don’t worry about me, save the Red Guards!” This was the heroic voice of Li Wenzhong in the vast Gan River, in his final moments.

On August 19, 1967, under the bright sun and the vast Gan River, Li Wenzhong and his ten comrades escorted a group of Red Guard revolutionary youths and revolutionary masses across the Gan River to return home and make revolution. The boat sank suddenly in the middle of the river, and everyone was thrown into the water.

Li Wenzhong struggled against the waves, loudly reciting Chairman Mao’s quotations: "With firm determination, fearing neither difficulties nor sacrifice, and overcoming all obstacles, we shall win victory." Instantly, a red sun rose in everyone's heart. "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the sky.

Chairman Mao's teachings turned into immense strength, inspiring people to overcome the rapids and encouraging Li Wenzhong and his comrades to bravely rescue. Li Wenzhong, through the waves of "Long live Chairman Mao!" in the river, braved the waves to rescue the Red Guard revolutionary youths and revolutionary masses. After continuous intense battles, Li Wenzhong was exhausted. At this moment, a Red Guard was about to be sucked into the river's vortex. Li Wenzhong was anxious and rushed to save him without hesitation. His comrades saw that he could not hold on and rushed to rescue him. Li Wenzhong loudly replied: "Don’t worry about me, save the Red Guards!"

“Don’t worry about me!” These words expressed the noble qualities of a proletarian hero: unlimited loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, deep love for the Red Guard youths, and ardent devotion to the revolutionary cause. These four shining words radiate the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, embodying Li Wenzhong's selfless communist spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly.

Li Wenzhong sacrificed himself, but his heroic image will forever be etched in people's hearts. Whenever his comrades remember him, they think of how, since the Cultural Revolution, he had always been loyal to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao's every step, and climbing the peak of proletarian "public spirit" with each step.

When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution just began, the "Three Family Village" was smashed, and the "Four Family Shop" was exposed. At that time, Li Wenzhong, who was working in a mountain village, was very happy. To deeply understand the great significance of this Cultural Revolution, Li Wenzhong often organized the entire platoon to study Chairman Mao's series of great instructions on the Cultural Revolution. He said, this Cultural Revolution is too good. If these counter-revolutionary revisionists succeed in their plots, as Chairman Mao taught, "in a few years or ten years, and in many cases, in a few decades, it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." One day, he led the entire platoon to the mountains to dig wild vegetables and had a bitter meal. After the meal, Li Wenzhong said passionately: "We had a very bitter meal, but the old society was a thousand times, ten thousand times more bitter. Chairman Mao led us to make revolution, and the poor people stood up and were liberated. But the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the Party are frantically pushing for capitalist restoration, trying to make us take the road back, and suffer twice the bitterness. Can we agree to that?" A bitter meal aroused the soldiers' deep hatred for the class enemy. The entire platoon held meetings and wrote articles to denounce the heinous crimes of the "Three Family Village" and the "Four Family Shop," making everyone's thoughts closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and keep up with the steps of the Cultural Revolution.

The great Red Guard movement rose with irresistible momentum, cleansing the muddy waters left over from the old society. At this time, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party spread rumors and slanders. Rumors and gossip from society reached the company. How should we treat this new thing, the Red Guards—should we criticize and oppose it with gestures and words, or should we support it wholeheartedly? Li Wenzhong stayed up all night studying Chairman Mao's works. "Revolution is an uprising, a violent action by one class to overthrow another." Chairman Mao's teachings made Li Wenzhong further realize that the Red Guard revolutionary youths are the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution, the gravediggers of imperialism and revisionism, and the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. He was the first in the platoon to shout: "The Red Guard movement is very good!"

He actively helped the Red Guards in the local primary school to break the old and establish the new. He organized the entire platoon to enthusiastically receive the Red Guards on their great link-up. He wrote several letters to his younger brothers and sisters, urging them to pay attention to national affairs, join the Red Guards, and participate in this great revolutionary movement.

In January, the revolutionary storm swept across the country. At this time, the great leader Chairman Mao issued the great battle call: "The People's Liberation Army should support the leftist broad masses." Li Wenzhong and the soldiers discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's call. The soldiers said: "This is Chairman Mao's greatest trust and concern for us, letting us go for tempering." Li Wenzhong said: "You are right, but you should look further." Then, he waved his hand and said: "Look south, American imperialism is invading brother Vietnam; look east, it is the place under American imperialism's slavery; look north, it is the Soviet Union under the rule of the revisionist clique; look west, the Western world is all dark. The people of the world need Mao Zedong Thought. Our Cultural Revolution is to occupy all positions with Mao Zedong Thought, uproot the roots of revisionism, and ensure that China remains red for thousands of generations. With a red China, the world revolution has hope. We support the left, which is to support the world revolution."

"With a red China, the world revolution has hope." Li Wenzhong summed up his deep understanding of the great significance of the Cultural Revolution with this shining sentence, inspiring him to work day and night on the "three supports, two militarizations" front.

After the broadcast of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," Li Wenzhong copied it down that night. The next morning, he organized the soldiers to drum and beat gongs to propagate in the rural villages, sending Chairman Mao's voice to the hearts of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants.

The great leader Chairman Mao instructed the People's Liberation Army to go to schools for military and political training. Li Wenzhong rushed to the military training post. In a school, he firmly supported the leftists, expanding and strengthening the leftist forces in that school.

In July 1967, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Jiangxi were engaged in a life-and-death struggle with a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin ordered Li Wenzhong's unit to enter Jiangxi to support the left.

The news reached the Sixth Company, Fourth Platoon, and the soldiers were all excited. To complete the glorious task entrusted by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, Li Wenzhong seized the short days before departure to mobilize the entire platoon to identify problems and find solutions. Li Wenzhong used Chairman Mao's teachings to answer sixteen questions on how to identify the leftists, support the leftists, help the leftists, and grasp the direction of the struggle in supporting the left work. As soon as Li Wenzhong arrived in Jiangxi, he braved the storm of class struggle on the front line of supporting the left. He had the firmest stance and the clearest banner. No matter what tricks the class enemies played, he saw through the soft ones and stood firm against the hard ones, always standing on the side of the leftists.

In a factory in the Nanchang area, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat were in a difficult situation under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. Li Wenzhong and his comrades arrived at this factory and firmly supported the leftist masses. Li Wenzhong told the revolutionary soldiers of the proletariat: "We firmly support you." Encouraging them to bravely fight against the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. The revolutionary soldiers were excited and said: "You are indeed the relatives sent by Chairman Mao."

One summer night, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Jiangxi Cotton Textile and Dyeing Factory were going to hold a meeting to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. In the past, due to the obstruction and sabotage by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, the meeting had failed to be held several times. Li Wenzhong, who was supporting the left here, heard that the meeting was to be held and voluntarily requested to guard them. The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon put on new uniforms, spirited and radiant, guarding around the meeting venue. The revolutionary soldiers tightly grasped the hands of the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, excitedly saying: With the PLA as our backing, our spines are stiffer.

Li Wenzhong had a heart for the left. In a "speech on supporting the left," he wrote: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The People's Liberation Army should support the leftist broad masses.' We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and firmly and unambiguously support the revolutionary leftists of Jiangxi Province, vowing to be a strong backing, no matter how the wind blows and the waves beat, we will firmly unite with the revolutionary leftists and Red Guard youths, fight together, and win together." Hero Li Wenzhong's "speech on supporting the left" was not delivered, but his revolutionary spirit will forever shine brightly.

"Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army, which is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution." Li Wenzhong studied Chairman Mao's teachings and always paid attention to doing work among the deceived masses. He often said: "Winning over one more deceived mass to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is adding one more revolutionary force, which is a blow to the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party."

During the days of supporting the left, Li Wenzhong did a lot of hard and meticulous ideological and political work among the deceived masses. No matter how good or bad their attitude was, he always enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought to them, propagated the great significance of the Cultural Revolution, and made many deceived masses return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In the busy days and nights, Li Wenzhong went to factories, villages, and schools, executing tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, and military training. From one battlefield to another, he quickly and unconditionally delivered Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and every battle command to the masses, making immortal contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao, Brave the Storms and March Forward

Only heroes can drive tigers and leopards, and heroes are not afraid of bears and wolves.

Li Wenzhong, who was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, dared to think, speak, and fight. At every critical moment of class struggle, he bravely stood out and fought courageously.

In 1963, Li Wenzhong, who was eager to study Chairman Mao's works, urgently wanted to obtain Chairman Mao's four-volume books. However, Liu Shaoqi and his agents Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi used the ideological and cultural positions they had usurped to maliciously sabotage the publication of Chairman Mao's works and frantically obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. Li Wenzhong sent letter after letter to various places to ask people to buy the books; he went to the city to look for the books time and time again, but all in vain. He was furious and slammed the table, saying to the company commander: "Chairman Mao's books are revolutionary treasures, why aren't they mass-produced? Those worthless books are flying everywhere, I think and think, there must be big villains behind this."

In 1962, Liu Shaoqi launched the black wind of "three autonomies and one contract," which blew to Li Wenzhong's hometown production team. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists stirred up trouble, and the spontaneous capitalist forces also rose. Li Wenzhong took leave to visit his hometown. He saw these problems and his mood could not calm down for a long time. Late at night, he took out the Mao Zedong quotations he had clipped from the Liberation Army Daily and read them carefully, thinking deeply. "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field are still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce." The great leader Chairman Mao's teachings were like a shining lantern, making him see more clearly and making his heart brighter, seeing clearly: the domestic class enemies, in collaboration with the international imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary anti-China chorus, were pushing for capitalist restoration. The next day, he found the cadres of the production brigade and studied Chairman Mao's works together, recalling bitterness and sweetness. He said: "The problems that appeared in our village are not small matters, but the top priority in the struggle between the two roads, a top priority matter concerning whether the country will change color. Chairman Mao saved us from the fire, but now someone wants to push us into the fire pit, can we agree to that?" Some cadres said helplessly: "There are people promoting it from above, and people causing trouble from below, this is hard to handle!" Li Wenzhong said: "No matter who it is from above or below, as long as they do not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we will firmly not agree." With Li Wenzhong's repeated help, the cadres of the production team raised their class consciousness. Li Wenzhong then went with them to deeply penetrate the masses, firmly grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasp class struggle, and mobilize the poor and lower-middle peasants to resist the black wind of "three autonomies and one contract."

Li Wenzhong brought this conscious concern for national affairs and this conscious spirit of struggle wherever he went. During field training, he had firmly fought against the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some local cadres. During national defense construction, he had enthusiastically propagated Mao Zedong Thought in the local production team, enhancing the class struggle consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, and finally exposing a historical counter-revolutionary who had infiltrated the cadre team of the production team.

Li Wenzhong was such a person full of fighting spirit! He was the vanguard against capitalist restoration, a hero in uprooting revisionism, and a loyal soldier defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He braved the storms of domestic and international class struggle, bravely advanced, and quickly grew into an outstanding representative of the advanced elements of the proletariat in continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In 1964, our army, following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought," was vigorously carrying out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Liu Shaoqi's agent, the great schemer and conspirator Luo Ruiqing, to achieve his evil goal of usurping the Party and the army, frantically promoted the bourgeois reactionary military line, gathering "elites," holding large-scale competitions, sabotaging the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and impacting proletarian politics. At this critical moment of the struggle between the two lines, Li Wenzhong bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. At that time, Li Wenzhong was the platoon leader of the Second Artillery Company. Someone proposed to make his led Third Platoon into a technical elite platoon, which he firmly rejected. In a meeting, Li Wenzhong was the first to bravely stand up and fiercely attack the purely military viewpoint. He used Chairman Mao's "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas within the Party" and the 1960 resolution of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, chaired by Vice Chairman Lin, as weapons, sharply pointing out: large-scale competitions and gathering elites were precisely the bourgeois military thought that Chairman Mao had criticized more than thirty years ago. He said: "We fight wars relying on Mao Zedong Thought. Dong Cunrui sacrificed himself to blow up the fortress, Huang Jiguang used his chest to block the gun port, not relying on any technique, but relying on his loyalty to Chairman Mao. Practicing good techniques and having a bad head is only harmful to the revolution, not beneficial. Our army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. If we focus on military matters and neglect politics, the army will degenerate, and the country will change color!"

Li Wenzhong, despite all pressures, led the entire platoon to firmly walk the path of emphasizing politics. At the most intense time of the black wind of large-scale competitions impacting politics, he led the entire platoon to insist on reading Chairman Mao's books every day, unshakable. At that time, the entire platoon had only a few single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works. Li Wenzhong collected and copied Mao Zedong quotations everywhere. Every day, he cut out the Mao Zedong quotations published in the Liberation Army Daily, bound them into a book, and organized the entire platoon to study. He led the entire platoon to establish the system of study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, set up the column of study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, and turned the platoon meeting into a situation review meeting of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Every soldier in the platoon had a notebook of study and application of Mao Zedong Thought. Li Wenzhong used these actual actions of emphasizing proletarian politics to fight against the evil wind of large-scale competitions. He often said to his comrades: "We are Chairman Mao's soldiers, listen to what is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, and resist what is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought."

That autumn, Li Wenzhong was transferred to the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company as the platoon leader. A comrade of his participated in the military large-scale competition and became a technical "elite." Li Wenzhong sincerely said to him during a heart-to-heart talk: "I don't admire your 'elite.' The 'elite' produced by large-scale competitions is the product of the purely military viewpoint. Whether to build the army with Mao Zedong Thought or with military technology, this is a struggle between two military lines!"

At the end-of-year evaluation of the Four Good Units, someone thought that the military training results of the unit where Li Wenzhong was located were outstanding and worthy of the Four Good Units. At that time, Luo Ruiqing, this giant, was everywhere promoting the "achievements" of large-scale competitions. Li Wenzhong, however, listed ten major harms of gathering elites with his comrades using Mao Zedong Thought as a political microscope and telescope. He often said to his comrades: "We want a Four Good Unit that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, not a Four Good Unit that is first in technology."

That year, the Sixth Platoon led by Li Wenzhong, because it emphasized proletarian politics, became a hard-hitting Four Good Platoon.

Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao, Revolutionize the Soul

The great leader Chairman Mao exhorts us: "Be a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has transcended vulgar interests, a person who benefits the people."

The proletarian hero Li Wenzhong is such a new person of communism.

Hero Li Wenzhong was born into a poor peasant family in Weifang County, Shandong Province, with a history of hardship. He loved Chairman Mao from a young age. In 1960, at the age of 18, Li Wenzhong came to this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the army. He actively responded to Vice Chairman Lin's call to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought," eagerly read Chairman Mao's books, and resolutely acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. He quickly and honorably joined the Communist Party of China. From his own growth and progress, he deeply felt that to follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, to completely and thoroughly serve the people, he must strive to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, break with selfishness, and establish public spirit, thoroughly transforming his worldview. He often said to his comrades: "If there is a 'self' that is not fought, it is disloyal to Chairman Mao. Whether to fight selfishness or not is the touchstone of whether one is a true revolutionary or a false revolutionary."

Li Wenzhong, following Chairman Mao's teachings on combining theory with practice, over the years, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely fight against the "self" in his mind, finding a fundamental way to accelerate his ideological revolutionization. This is what Li Wenzhong personally wrote in his ideological report outline: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly expose, fiercely fight, and resolutely change the bourgeois 'self.'"

Since Li Wenzhong joined the army, in his struggle journey, he encountered many problems. He regarded how to deal with these problems as a reflection of his worldview, a struggle between public and private interests, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, through exposure, struggle, and change, solving them one by one, continuously promoting his ideological revolutionization.

In a study and application meeting of Mao Zedong Thought, facing more than fifty officers and soldiers of the regiment, Li Wenzhong went on stage to expose his selfishness. He turned over every corner of his soul, exposing all the dirt. Li Wenzhong said: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We are not afraid to point out our shortcomings.' Exposing selfishness is to expose all the dirt in the depths of the soul."

In a democratic meeting, the soldiers gave some criticism to Li Wenzhong, who had just become the platoon leader, some of which were quite sharp. Li Wenzhong welcomed it on the spot and wrote a letter of thanks on red paper after the meeting, thanking the comrades who gave him criticism for their help. A soldier's criticism was a bit extreme, and others criticized him for being too harsh. However, Li Wenzhong found him for a private talk, removed his concerns, and sincerely said to him: "You criticize for the revolution, and I correct my shortcomings for the revolution. I welcome you to give me more criticism in the future." Li Wenzhong wrote down the soldiers' criticisms, one by one, in a notebook, studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, checked and struggled against "self," changing one by one. The soldiers praised, saying that the platoon leader corrected his shortcomings like a decisive battle, a battle of annihilation, truly saying what he did and doing what he said.

"We Communist Party members should face the wind and rain, see the world; this wind and rain is the great wind and rain of the people's struggle, and this world is the great world of the people's struggle." Li Wenzhong followed Chairman Mao's teachings, in the great storms and waves of class struggle, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, breaking "self," establishing "public," and was indeed a hero who could withstand the test of storms and waves.

In July 1967, Li Wenzhong entered the Jiangxi Cotton Textile and Dyeing Factory with his company to support the left, publicly expressing support for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. At this time, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party regarded the Fourth Platoon as a thorn in the eye and a bone in the throat, inciting the deceived masses to attack the Fourth Platoon, trying every means to drive the Fourth Platoon out. In this situation, with "public" in mind, one could brave the storms and advance, but with "self" in mind, one would avoid the struggle. Li Wenzhong organized the entire platoon to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. Chairman Mao instructed: "We must stand on the side of the people, absolutely not on the side of the people's enemies. This is a fundamental issue of stance for a Marxist-Leninist." Li Wenzhong and his comrades drew infinite strength from Chairman Mao's teachings. He said confidently: "We defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, daring to climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire. We support the leftists a thousand times, ten thousand times, and we will definitely support them."

Our most respected great leader Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us, "completely" and "thoroughly" for the people, "selflessly serving the people." Hero Li Wenzhong faithfully and strictly followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, resolutely and thoroughly transforming his worldview, integrating Mao Zedong Thought into his blood, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide all his thoughts and actions. In his mind, there was only the dazzling Mao Zedong Thought of great public spirit. In the face of sharp class struggle, he had no "self"; when accepting criticism and criticizing others, he had no "self"; in the face of family problems, he had no "self"; in the face of material treatment, he had no "self"; and at the critical moment of life and death, he still had no "self."

“Don’t worry about me, save the Red Guards!” This was the last words of hero Li Wenzhong in his final moments.

These words revealed hero Li Wenzhong's loyalty to Chairman Mao. These words showed hero Li Wenzhong's broad-mindedness. These words summed up hero Li Wenzhong's life of integrating Mao Zedong Thought into his soul. The image of the proletarian hero Li Wenzhong, who was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, will inspire hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to march towards the brilliant world of proletarian "public spirit."

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long, long live!

    无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子的突出代表李文忠
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，推动历史车轮滚滚向前。
    “毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，
    毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
    这是毛泽东时代的英雄战士李文忠和英雄四排的同志，在无产阶级文化大革命的暴风骤雨中发出的豪迈誓言。它是亿万革命人民的共同心愿，它是时代的最强音。
    李文忠同志是六○一一部队某部六连四排排长，他为了抢救落水的红卫兵小将和革命群众，在赣江壮烈牺牲。他把年轻的生命献给了关系到中国前途和人类命运的伟大革命。
    我们伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副统帅，亲自批准授予李文忠以“支左爱民模范”的光荣称号。
    李文忠的英雄事迹，从毛主席亲自创建的第一个革命根据地——井冈山麓，传遍全中国，传到全世界。
    一个学英雄思想，走英雄道路，创英雄业绩的活动，正在全国蓬勃地开展起来。多少无产阶级革命派、红卫兵和广大革命群众庄严宣誓，决心继承英雄志，誓将遗愿化宏图。他们以李文忠为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，斗私批修，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    多少国际友人，为世界革命根据地又出现一个用毛泽东思想哺育成长的革命英雄而欢呼，而自豪。阿尔巴尼亚的同志说：有李文忠这样的英雄战士，中国永远不会变颜色，世界革命有了最可靠的接班人。锡兰战友在李文忠事迹展览馆的留言簿上写道：“李文忠是亚非拉革命人民的光辉榜样。”
    永远忠于毛主席支左爱民一颗心
      “不要管我，救红卫兵要紧！”这是英雄李文忠在浩浩赣水之中，在生命最后时刻，迸发出来的豪迈声音。
      一九六七年八月十九日，阳光灿烂，赣水苍茫。李文忠和他的十名战友，护送一批红卫兵革命小将和革命群众横渡赣江，回乡闹革命。渡船行到江心，突然下沉，船上的人一下子被掀到江中。
    李文忠搏击着浪涛，高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”顿时，一轮红太阳在每个人心头升起。“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”的口号声响彻云霄。
    毛主席的教导化为巨大的力量，激励着人们战胜激流，鼓舞着李文忠和他的战友奋勇抢救。李文忠穿过满江“毛主席万岁”的声浪，顶波劈流抢救红卫兵革命小将和革命群众。连续紧张的战斗，使李文忠筋疲力尽。这时，有一个红卫兵眼看要被卷进江心漩涡。李文忠心急如焚，又不顾一切地扑去，他的战友看到他支持不住了，赶来抢救。李文忠响亮地回答：“不要管我，救红卫兵要紧！”
      “不要管我”！这句话表达出了一个无产阶级英雄战士的高贵品质：对党对毛主席无限忠诚，对红卫兵小将无比热爱，对革命事业满腔热忱。这光辉夺目的四个字，闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，它是李文忠同志毫不利己专门利人的共产主义精神的集中表现。
    李文忠牺牲了，但他的英雄形象永远铭刻在人们的心中。李文忠的战友们，每当怀念他的时候，就想到他文化大革命以来，一直是对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离，一步一个脚印地攀登上了无产阶级“公”字的高峰。
    无产阶级文化大革命刚刚开始的时候，“三家村”被捣毁了，“四家店”被揭露出来了。当时正在山村施工的李文忠，心里非常高兴。为了深刻地理解这场文化大革命的伟大意义，李文忠经常组织全排学习毛主席关于文化大革命的一系列伟大指示。他说，这场文化大革命太好了，如果让这些反革命修正主义分子阴谋得逞，就会象毛主席教导的那样：“少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”一天，他带领全排到山上挖野菜，吃了一顿忆苦饭。饭后李文忠激昂地说：“我们吃的是一顿很苦的饭，但是，旧社会比这顿饭苦一千倍，一万倍。毛主席领导我们闹革命，穷人翻身得解放。可是，混进党内的资产阶级代表人物拚命搞资本主义复辟，想要我们走回头路，吃二茬苦，我们能答应吗？”一顿忆苦饭，激发了战士们对阶级敌人的无比愤恨，全排开大会、写文章，声讨“三家村”、“四家店”的滔天罪行，使同志们的思想紧紧地跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署，跟上文化大革命的步伐。
    伟大的红卫兵运动的兴起，以锐不可挡的气势，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水。这时，党内一小撮走资派造谣诽谤。社会上的流言蜚语传到了连队。对待红卫兵这个新生事物，是指手划脚批评和反对呢，还是满腔热情地支持？李文忠通宵不眠学习了毛主席著作。“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”毛主席的教导使李文忠进一步认识到，红卫兵革命小将是文化大革命的急先锋，是帝国主义、修正主义的掘墓人，是无产阶级革命事业的接班人。他在全排第一个喊出了：“红卫兵运动好得很！”
    他主动帮助驻地小学的红小兵大破四旧，大立四新。他组织全排热情地接待大串连的红卫兵。他几次写信给他的弟弟妹妹，要他们关心国家大事，参加红卫兵，投身到这场伟大的革命运动中。
    一月革命风暴席卷全国，这时候伟大统帅毛主席发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大战斗号令。李文忠和战士们畅谈毛主席这一号召的伟大意义。战士们说：“这是毛主席给我们的最大信任和最大关怀，是让我们去锻炼。”李文忠说：“你们说得对，还要看得更远些。”接着，他挥动着手说：“向南看，美帝国主义正在侵略兄弟的越南；向东看，是美帝国主义奴役下的地方；向北看，是修正主义集团统治下的苏联；向西看，西方世界一片黑。世界人民都需要毛泽东思想。我国的文化大革命就是要用毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，挖掉修正主义的根子，保证中国千秋万代不变色。有了红色的中国，世界革命就有希望。我们支左，就是支持世界革命。”
      “有了红色的中国，世界革命就有希望。”李文忠用这句闪光的语言，概括了他对文化大革命伟大意义的深刻理解，鼓舞着他夜以继日地奋战在“三支”“两军”的岗位上。
    《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》广播后，李文忠连夜抄录下来，第二天一早，组织战士敲锣打鼓到农村山庄进行宣传，把毛主席的声音送到广大贫下中农的心坎里。
    伟大统帅毛主席指示人民解放军到学校搞军政训练，李文忠奔赴军训岗位。在一个学校里，他坚决支持左派，壮大发展了这个学校的左派队伍。
    一九六七年七月，江西省无产阶级革命派，正在同党内一小撮走资派作殊死的斗争。伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席命令李文忠所在部队入赣支左。
      消息传到六连四排，战士们个个欢欣鼓舞。为了圆满完成毛主席和林副主席交给的光荣任务，李文忠抓紧待命出发的短短几天，发动全排摆问题，找答案。李文忠用毛主席的教导回答了支左工作中怎样识别左派，怎样支持左派，怎样帮助左派，怎样掌握斗争大方向等十六个怎么办。李文忠一到江西，就迎着阶级斗争的大风雨，战斗在支左第一线。他立场最坚定，旗帜最鲜明，不管阶级敌人耍什么阴谋诡计，软的看得清，硬的顶得住，始终站在左派一边。
      南昌地区一个工厂处在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖之中，无产阶级革命派的处境困难。李文忠和战友们来到这个工厂，坚定地支持左派群众。李文忠对无产阶级革命派战士说：“我们坚决支持你们。”鼓励他们勇敢地向党内一小撮走资派作斗争。革命派的战士激动地说：“你们真是毛主席派来的亲人。”
    一个盛夏的晚上，江西棉纺织印染厂的无产阶级革命派要召开大会，批判资产阶级反动路线。过去，由于党内一小撮走资派进行阻挠和破坏，使大会几次都没有开成。在这里支左的李文忠一听要开大会，主动要求给他们站岗。四排战士换上了新军装，精神抖擞、英姿焕发地守卫在会场四周。革命派战士紧紧握住四排同志的手，激动地说：有解放军作我们的后盾，我们的腰杆更硬了。
      李文忠一颗红心为左派。他在一篇“支左讲话”中写道：“毛主席教导我们说：‘人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。’我们坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，坚定不移地、毫不含糊地支持江西省无产阶级革命派，誓作坚强后盾，不管风吹浪打，坚决和革命左派、红卫兵小将团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”英雄李文忠的这篇“支左讲话”虽然没有来得及讲，但他的革命精神永远发出灿烂的光辉。
      “组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”李文忠学习毛主席这一教导，时刻注意做受蒙蔽群众的工作。他经常说：“多争取一个受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来，就多增加一分革命力量，就是对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一个打击。”
    在支左的日子里，李文忠对受蒙蔽的群众作了大量的、艰苦细致的思想政治工作。不管对方态度好坏，他总是满腔热情地向他们宣传毛泽东思想，宣传文化大革命的伟大意义，使很多受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    李文忠在紧张的日日夜夜里，到过工厂、农村、学校，执行过支左、支工、支农和军训任务，从这个战斗岗位，奔赴那个战斗阵地，把毛主席的伟大战略部署，每个战斗命令，迅速地、不折不扣地送到群众中去，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。
  永远忠于毛主席　顶风劈浪向前进
      独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。
    无限忠于毛主席的李文忠，敢想敢说敢斗争，在阶级斗争的每一关键时刻，他都挺身而出，勇敢战斗。
    一九六三年，学习毛主席著作如饥似渴的李文忠，迫切希望得到毛主席的四卷宝书。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭真、陆定一之流，利用他们所窃踞的思想文化阵地，恶毒破坏毛主席著作的出版，疯狂阻挠毛泽东思想的传播。李文忠向各地发出了一封又一封信，托人购买宝书；自己一次又一次地进城寻找宝书，可是都落了空。他气极了，拍着桌子对连长说：“毛主席的书是革命的宝，为什么不大量出版？那些乌七八糟的破书倒满天飞，我横想竖想，总有大坏蛋在捣鬼。”
    一九六二年，中国赫鲁晓夫刮起了“三自一包”的黑风，吹到了李文忠家乡的生产队，地富反坏右兴风作浪，自发资本主义势力也在抬头。李文忠请假探家，他看到了这些问题，心情久久地不能平静。深夜，他拿出从《解放军报》上剪贴成册的毛主席语录，认真阅读，反复思考。“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”伟大领袖毛主席的教导，象一盏光芒四射的明灯，使他眼更明，心更亮，清楚地看到：国内的阶级敌人配合国际帝修反的反华大合唱，正在搞资本主义复辟。第二天，他就找生产大队的干部，一起学习毛主席著作，忆苦思甜。他说：“咱村出现的这些问题，可不是小事，这是两条道路斗争的头等大事，是关系国家变不变颜色的头等大事。毛主席把咱救出了火海，现在又有人要把咱往火坑里推，咱们能答应吗？”有的干部为难地说：“上面有人提倡，下面有人捣乱，这事难办啦！”李文忠说：“不管他上面下面，什么人只要不按毛主席的指示办事，咱们就坚决不答应。”在李文忠多次的帮助下，生产队的干部提高了阶级觉悟。李文忠又同他们一起深入群众，狠抓毛主席著作学习，狠抓阶级斗争，发动贫下中农顶住了“三自一包”黑风。
    李文忠走到那里，就把这种自觉关心国家大事，自觉进行斗争的革命精神带到那里。在野营训练中，他曾经同驻地个别干部的自发资本主义倾向，作过坚决的斗争。在国防施工中，他曾经到驻地生产队热情宣传毛泽东思想，广大贫下中农增强了阶级斗争观念，终于揪出了钻进生产队干部队伍中的一个历史反革命分子。
    李文忠同志就是这样一个充满斗争精神的人！他是反资本主义复辟的尖兵，他是挖修正主义根子的英雄，他是捍卫毛主席革命路线的忠诚战士。他迎着国内外阶级斗争的风浪，奋勇前进，迅速成长为在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的无产阶级先进分子的突出代表。
    一九六四年，我军遵照林副主席关于“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的指示，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动正在广泛深入地开展。中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人，大野心家、大阴谋家罗瑞卿，为了达到篡党篡军的罪恶目的，疯狂地推行资产阶级反动军事路线，拼凑“尖子”，搞大比武，破坏活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，冲击无产阶级政治。在这两条路线斗争的关键时刻，李文忠勇敢地捍卫毛主席的革命路线。当时，李文忠在二炮连当班长，有人提议要把他领导的三班，搞成技术尖子班，被他坚决顶了回去。在一次会议上，李文忠第一个勇敢地站出来，向单纯军事观点猛烈开火。他用毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和一九六○年林副主席亲自主持制订的军委扩大会议决议为武器，尖锐指出：大比武，搞尖子，正是毛主席早在三十多年前批判过的资产阶级军事思想。他说：“我们打仗靠的是毛泽东思想。董存瑞舍身炸碉堡，黄继光用胸膛堵枪眼，不是靠什么技术，而是凭着对毛主席的赤胆忠心。练一身好技术，长一个坏脑袋，对革命只有坏处，没有好处。我军是无产阶级专政的支柱，抓了军事，丢了政治，军队就会变质，国家就会变色！”
    李文忠不顾一切压力，和全班同志一起，坚定不移地走突出政治的路。在大比武黑风冲击政治最厉害的时候，他带领全班坚持天天读毛主席的书，雷打不动。那时，全班只有几本毛主席著作单行本。李文忠就到处收集和抄写毛主席语录。每天他都把《解放军报》上刊登的毛主席语录剪下来，装订成册，组织全班学习。他领导全班建立了活学活用毛主席著作讲用会的制度；办起了活学活用毛主席著作心得体会栏；他把班务会变成了活学活用毛主席著作情况的讲评会。全班战士每人都有一本活学活用毛主席著作的心得笔记本。李文忠就是这样用突出无产阶级政治的实际行动，同大比武的妖风进行了针锋相对的斗争。他经常对同志们说：“我们是毛主席的战士，符合毛泽东思想的话就听，不符合毛泽东思想的事就顶。”
    这年秋天，李文忠调到六连四排当班长，他的一个战友参加军事大比武，成了技术“尖子”。李文忠在同他谈心时，诚恳地对他说：“你这个‘尖子’，我是不佩服的。大比武搞出来的‘尖子’，是单纯军事观点的产物。靠毛泽东思想建设军队，还是靠军事技术建设军队，这可是两条军事路线的斗争啊！”
    年终四好总评，有人认为李文忠所在的连队军事训练成绩突出，够得上四好。当时罗瑞卿这个庞然大物，正在到处鼓吹大比武的“成绩”。李文忠却和全班战士用毛泽东思想这个政治上的显微镜、望远镜，给拼凑尖子列出了十大危害。他经常对同志们说：“咱们要的是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的四好连，绝不要技术第一的四好连。”
    这一年，李文忠领导的六班，由于突出了无产阶级政治，成了过得硬的四好班。
  永远忠于毛主席　灵魂深处闹革命
    伟大领袖毛主席号召我们：做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”。
    无产阶级英雄战士李文忠，就是这样一个共产主义新人。
    英雄李文忠，出身在山东潍县的一个贫农家庭里，有着一部苦难的家史。他从小就热爱毛主席。一九六○年，十八岁的李文忠来到了部队这个毛泽东思想大学校里。他积极响应林副主席“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的号召，刻苦读毛主席的书，坚决照毛主席的指示办事，很快就光荣地加入了中国共产党。他从自己的成长进步中深深体会到，要紧跟毛主席闹革命，完全、彻底为人民服务，就要努力活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，彻底改造世界观。他经常对同志们说：“有了‘私’字不斗，就是对毛主席的不忠。愿不愿斗私，是真革命还是假革命的试金石。”
    李文忠遵照毛主席关于理论联系实际的教导，几年来，特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，找到了一条加速自己思想革命化的根本途径，这就是李文忠在他的思想汇报提纲中亲笔写下的：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对资产阶级“私”字进行“彻底地亮，狠狠地斗，坚决地改”。
    李文忠同志入伍以来，在他的斗争历程中，遇到过许许多多的问题。他把如何对待这些问题，看作是世界观的反映，公和私的斗争，用毛泽东思想为武器，通过亮、斗、改，一个一个地加以解决，不断促进自己的思想革命化。
    在一次活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会上，面对营里五十多名干部战士，李文忠登台亮私。他把自己灵魂深处的“私”字，翻箱倒柜，全盘端出。李文忠同志说：“毛主席教导我们：‘我们不怕说出自己的毛病’。亮私就是要亮出灵魂深处的全部脏东西。”
    在一次民主会上，战士们给刚当排长的李文忠提了一些意见，有的意见比较尖锐。李文忠当场表示欢迎，会后用红纸写了一封感谢信，感谢给他提意见的同志对自己的帮助。有个战士提的意见有些偏激，别人批评他有些过火。但是李文忠却找着他个别谈心，解除他的顾虑，诚恳地对他说：“你为革命提意见，我为革命改缺点，欢迎你以后给我更多的批评。”李文忠把战士提的意见，一条一条写在本子上，活学活用毛主席著作，对照检查，狠斗“私”字，有一条改一条。战士们赞扬说，排长改缺点是打速决战、歼灭战，真是说到做到，说改就改。
      “我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”李文忠遵循毛主席的教导，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，不愧为经得起惊涛骇浪考验的英雄战士。
    一九六七年七月，李文忠随同连队进入江西棉纺织印染厂支左，公开表示支持无产阶级革命派。这时，党内一小撮走资派把四排看作是眼中钉、肉中刺，挑动受蒙蔽群众对四排围攻，千方百计想把四排挤出去。在这种情况下，“公”字当头，就能顶着风浪前进，“私”字当头，就会逃避斗争。李文忠组织全排反复学习了毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导。毛主席指示：“必须站在人民群众这一边，绝不能站到人民敌人那一边去。这是一个马克思列宁主义者的根本立场问题。”李文忠和他的战友们从毛主席的教导中，吸取了无穷的力量。他理直气壮地说：“我们保卫毛主席的革命路线，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，对左派我们一千个支持，一万个支持，支持定了。”
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席谆谆教导我们，“完全”“彻底”为人民，“毫不利己专门利人”。英雄李文忠，忠实、严格地遵循毛主席的伟大教导，坚决、彻底地改造自己的世界观，把毛泽东思想溶化进自己的血液，用毛泽东思想指导自己的全部思想和行动。在他的头脑里只有金光闪闪的毛泽东思想的大公。在尖锐的阶级斗争面前，他没有“我”字；在接受批评和批评别人的时候，他没有“我”字；在家庭问题面前，他没有“我”字；在物质待遇面前，他没有“我”字；在生死关头，他同样没有“我”字。
      “不要管我，救红卫兵要紧！”这是英雄李文忠在生命最后时刻留下的最后一句话。
    这句话，托出了英雄李文忠对毛主席的赤胆忠心。这句话，展现了英雄李文忠放眼世界的宽阔胸怀。这句话，总结了英雄李文忠把毛泽东思想化为自己灵魂的光辉一生。无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级英雄战士——李文忠同志的崇高形象，将鼓舞亿万革命人民向着光辉灿烂的无产阶级“公”字世界迈进。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！万岁！万万岁！
