Mao Zedong Thought is the Lifeline of the World's Revolutionary People
Congolese (Brazzaville) Workers Eagerly Study the Quotations from Chairman Mao

We Must All Study Chairman Mao's Works

At the moment the sun rises in the east, at the banks of the Congo River in the suburbs of Brazzaville, workers at the Kinsondi United Textile Factory are gathered in groups studying the Quotations from Chairman Mao. This is the moment before work, the most precious moment of the day for the more than a thousand workers at the Kinsondi United Textile Factory. Many workers use this moment each day to collectively study the Quotations from Chairman Mao. Some workers, after studying, also sing in Chinese: "With firm resolve, fearing not sacrifice, surmounting every difficulty, to strive for victory."

Some workers, though illiterate, are equally eager to obtain and study the Quotations from Chairman Mao. One day, many workers gathered around a Chinese expert to ask for the Quotations from Chairman Mao. Among the crowd, an elderly worker in his fifties named Andre also raised his hand and shouted, "Please give me a copy of the red treasure book - the Quotations from Chairman Mao!" Some young workers, with astonishment, asked him, "You can't read, why do you want the Quotations from Chairman Mao?" This elderly worker, who had suffered deeply under the cruel exploitation of the old and new colonialists in Congo (Leopoldville), solemnly said, "Although I can't read, I can have my children read it to me. What Chairman Mao says are the words in the hearts of the poor. I understand it as soon as I hear it." He said, "Chairman Mao's book is our lifeline. Chairman Mao's book has made me understand the source of exploitation and oppression, understand the true meaning of work. To stand up and no longer be bullied, whether one can read or not, one must study Chairman Mao's works." When he received the Quotations from Chairman Mao, he flipped to the first page, saw the portrait of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and excitedly kissed the portrait again and again. Then, holding the Quotations from Chairman Mao with both hands, he said, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao's Words Are All Truth

One evening, a worker named Daniel from this factory had a debate with his neighbor: where do people's correct ideas come from? Daniel quoted Chairman Mao's words to his neighbor, saying, "People's correct ideas come from social practice, only from the three kinds of social practice: production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." Daniel also said, "If you want to understand the principles of revolution, you must read Chairman Mao's books." Saying this, he opened the Quotations from Chairman Mao and read a few passages. At this moment, his neighbor stood up excitedly, took the Quotations from Chairman Mao, carefully flipped through it, and said, "Excellent! Chairman Mao's words are all truth. Give me this copy of the Quotations from Chairman Mao!" Daniel, to help his neighbor study the great Mao Zedong Thought, gave his precious treasure book to his neighbor.

Mao Zedong Thought Is the Guide to Revolution

One day, a trainee named Mencala Jacques, who had studied in China, sincerely told a reporter, "Chinese experts treat our cause as their own. This is the spirit of high internationalism. This is because Chinese experts are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Chinese experts not only taught us technology, but more importantly, they brought us Mao Zedong Thought."

A young worker named Ibawa Joseph met the reporter and recited six quotations from Chairman Mao in one breath. He said: Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of revolution, the Quotations from Chairman Mao is the treasure book of revolution, it is the guide to revolutionary action and work. Ibawa, who had only recently started working in the fine spinning workshop, quickly mastered not only general operating techniques but also machine installation. An old worker asked him in amazement why he progressed so fast. He replied, "It is Chairman Mao who gave it to me. Chairman Mao said, 'We can learn what we originally do not understand.' 'The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history.' He also said, 'As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, we can overcome all difficulties. Difficulties are paper tigers.'"

A worker who had once been a member of the civilian defense team, Simon, said, "The revolutionary people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, must carry on the struggle against imperialism, especially against American imperialism, against modern revisionism and the reactionaries, to the end. This requires learning Mao Zedong Thought." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. Mao Zedong Thought is a truth proven by the long-term revolution and construction in China, applicable to all places. The Chinese people have set a brilliant example for the world's people. Learning from China, following the Chinese path, is to learn Mao Zedong Thought." This worker, who loves and respects Chairman Mao infinitely, wrote on his Quotations from Chairman Mao his sincere wishes for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people: "The greatest Marxist-Leninist of contemporary times, long live Chairman Mao!"

### 毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的命根子　刚果（布）工人热情学习《毛主席语录》

专栏：毛泽东思想是革命人民最强大武器

　　毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的命根子
　　刚果（布）工人热情学习《毛主席语录》
　　我们都要学习毛主席著作
    在太阳从东方刚刚升起的时候，在刚果河畔布拉柴维尔郊区的金松迪联合纺织厂的工地上，工人们一组一组的在那里学习《毛主席语录》。这是上工前的一刻钟，是金松迪联合纺织厂的一千多工人一天中最宝贵的时刻。许多工人每天利用这一刻钟集体学习《毛主席语录》。有些工人在学习后，还用中文高唱着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    有的工人虽然不识字，但同样热切地希望得到和学习《毛主席语录》。一天，许多工人围着中国专家索取《毛主席语录》。在人群中，一位五十多岁的老工人安德烈也伸着手高声说：“请给我一本红色宝书——《毛主席语录》！”一些青年工人带着惊讶的神情问他：“你不识字，要《毛主席语录》干什么？”这位曾经在刚果（金）深受新老殖民主义者残酷剥削、饱尝辛酸的老工人郑重地说：“我虽然不识字，但可以让我的孩子们念给我听。毛主席讲的都是我们穷人心里的话，我一听就明白。”他说：“毛主席的书是我们的命根子，毛主席的书使我懂得了剥削和压迫的根源，懂得了工作的真正意义，要想翻身，不再受欺凌，不管识字不识字，都要学习毛主席的著作。”当他接过了《毛主席语录》，翻开第一页，看到世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席像时，他激动地对毛主席像亲了又亲，吻了又吻，然后双手捧着《毛主席语录》说：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    毛主席的话句句是真理
    一天晚上，这个工厂的一位名叫达尼埃尔的工人同他的一个邻居辩论：人的正确思想是从那里来的？达尼埃尔引用毛主席的话，向他的邻居说：“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”达尼埃尔还说：“你要懂得革命的道理，就要读毛主席的书。”说着，他打开《毛主席语录》，又念了几段毛主席的语录。这时，他的邻居激动得站了起来，拿过《毛主席语录》，仔细翻阅，然后说：“太好了！毛主席的话句句是真理，你把这本《毛主席语录》送给我吧！”达尼埃尔为了帮助他的邻居学习伟大的毛泽东思想，就把他的珍贵的宝书送给了他的邻居。
    毛泽东思想是革命的指南
    一天，一位曾经在中国学习过的实习生门卡拉·雅克诚恳地对记者说：“中国专家把我们的事业当成他们自己的事业。这是高度的无产阶级国际主义精神。这是因为中国专家是用毛泽东思想武装起来的。中国专家不仅教给了我们技术，更重要的是给我们送来了毛泽东思想。”
    一位名叫伊巴瓦·约瑟的青年工人碰见了记者，他一口气背诵了六条毛主席语录。他说：毛泽东思想是革命的真理，《毛主席语录》是革命的宝书，是革命和工作的行动指南。伊巴瓦到细纱车间工作不久，在很短的时间内，不仅学会了一般的操作技术，还学会了安装机器。一位老工人惊异地问他为什么进步那么快？他回答说：“是毛主席给我的，毛主席说：‘我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。’‘人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。’”他又说：“只要按着毛主席的教导做，一切困难都能克服，困难也是纸老虎。”
      一位当过民防团员的工人西蒙说：“世界革命人民，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民要把反帝特别是反对美帝国主义，反对现代修正主义和反动派的斗争进行到底，就必须学习毛泽东思想。”他说：“毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是经过中国长期革命和建设证明了的放之四海而皆准的真理。中国人民为世界人民树立了光辉的榜样。向中国学习，走中国的道路，就是要学习毛泽东思想。”这位无限热爱、无限敬仰毛主席的工人在他的《毛主席语录》上写下了他对世界革命人民的伟大领袖的衷心祝愿：“当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，祝您万寿无疆！”　（据新华社）
