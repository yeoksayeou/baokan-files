The nation's hundreds of millions of people, taking the heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong as examples, more consciously engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, sparking a revolution in the depths of their souls.

Determined to diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, they earnestly study, deeply understand, and strictly follow every instruction from Chairman Mao. Like the heroic Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, they fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and dedicate themselves to it in death.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 9th, our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the conferring of the honorable titles of "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" to the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company of the 601st Unit of the People's Liberation Army and "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" to Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong. This has set a shining example of ideological revolutionization for the nation's military and civilians. Revolutionary factions of the proletariat and broad revolutionary masses across the country enthusiastically acclaim and immediately launch a widespread and in-depth campaign to learn from the heroic deeds of the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong.

In the heroic Fourth Platoon's base in Jiangxi Province, from the foot of Jinggang Mountain to the vast Ganjiang River, broad revolutionary masses hold study sessions, discussion meetings, and report meetings on the heroic deeds. They express that learning from the heroes means, above all, to follow the heroes in using Mao Zedong Thought to guide every second of one's life, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to consciously break down private interests and establish public interests, and to spark a revolution in the depths of one's soul. The Red Guards of the 15th Middle School in Nanchang, who were rescued from the water by Li Wenzhong and others, with tears of gratitude and deep emotion, say, "We will turn our sorrow into strength, inherit the martyrs' will, be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We will be proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end."

In Li Wenzhong's hometown of Shandong Province, broad revolutionary factions of the proletariat and revolutionary masses repeatedly listen to broadcasts and study the Central Military Commission's order and the editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily." In study discussions, the broad revolutionary factions of the proletariat express their determination to follow the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, step by step, in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in life and dedicating themselves to it in death. Revolutionary mass organizations across Shandong Province call on their members to take the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong as examples, thoroughly transform their worldviews, and forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in the capital express their determination to act immediately on every instruction from Chairman Mao, to grasp and implement them thoroughly, and to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Broad revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards in universities and colleges also express their determination to consciously break down private interests and establish public interests, to uproot the "private" character of the bourgeoisie from their minds, to build a great wall of proletarian "public" character, and to achieve a thorough victory in the educational revolution.

The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee issued a notice on learning from the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, calling on the city's revolutionary masses and cadres to immediately launch a mass movement to propagate and learn from the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong. They should pour their deep love for the great leader Chairman Mao into the actual actions of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They should firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, and do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units.

Recently, Tianjin, which has just established a revolutionary committee, held a mass rally today. Comrade Xue Xuegong, head of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee, called on the city's proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary masses to immediately launch a widespread and in-depth campaign to learn from the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to take "self-criticism and criticism of revisionism" as the key, to set up extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to extensively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and to turn Tianjin into a red Mao Zedong Thought university. Representatives from various sectors such as industry, agriculture, and education spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their determination to truly achieve the goal of studying Chairman Mao's works word by word, executing Chairman Mao's instructions without the slightest deviation, propagating Mao Zedong Thought without a moment's pause, and defending Mao Zedong Thought without the slightest waver.

More than three thousand representatives attending the conference of active learners of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in Guizhou Province determined to follow the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong in achieving "Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance." The Red Guard representatives attending the conference also composed the heroic oath into a song for widespread propagation. They said, "The PLA comrades dedicated their lives to protecting us Red Guards. We will also protect the PLA with our lives and forever fight alongside the great People's Liberation Army of China."

Revolutionary masses in Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Gansu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Hebei, Tibet, and many other places also hold study sessions, discussion meetings, and seminars, determining to follow the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong in being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, unconditionally executing every battle command from Chairman Mao, and advancing bravely according to the course set by Chairman Mao.
