The People's Liberation Army Railway Corps, which is responsible for heavy railway construction tasks in various parts of northern and southern China, has thoroughly implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have vigorously promoted revolution and production, making the entire corps vibrant and full of revolutionary spirit. Many main railway lines have seen their engineering tasks completed better each month; some units have completed half a year's worth of engineering tasks in just one quarter; some units have set a new national record by completing a tunnel in one month with two entrances; some units have completed their annual tunnel construction and state investment plans 95 days ahead of schedule. Now, some main railway lines have been completed ahead of schedule and are officially open to traffic.

Revolution leads the way, production surges forward. This is the main characteristic of the Railway Corps' construction this year. The broad masses of soldiers and officers have placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position of primacy, above all else, greater than all else, and more important than all else. They have taken "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, vigorously criticizing the bourgeois military line of "emphasizing technology and engineering first" spread by China's Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing. They have firmly established Chairman Mao's military line, emphasized proletarian politics, and achieved a new leap in the ideological revolutionization of the troops, which has powerfully promoted the dual harvest of revolution and production. Every day, the broad masses of soldiers and officers start their day by saluting Chairman Mao's portrait, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life, studying Chairman Mao's quotations, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their thoughts, work, and life throughout the day. During construction, they study Chairman Mao's quotations extensively and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles." Troops excavating mountains and tunnels, facing hard rocks, use the spirit of the "Mythical Carpenter" to move mountains, loudly reciting Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to strive for victory." They sing labor songs composed of Chairman Mao's quotations, singing louder and stronger, breaking through one mountain after another, and building one tunnel after another. Bridge-building troops, under Chairman Mao's teachings of "this army has an indomitable spirit, it will overcome all enemies and will never be subdued by enemies," brave the cold of minus ten degrees, break through the ice, and excavate foundations in bone-chilling ice water. They build bridges that are numerous, fast, good, and economical. The soldiers and officers say: "With Mao Zedong Thought, we can make mountains bow and rivers yield, invincible and victorious everywhere."

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To be thrifty is to make revolution." During construction, the broad masses of soldiers and officers actively carry out technological innovation, technological revolution, and production and savings activities, sparing no effort to save every piece of board, every nail, every shovel of sand, every degree of electricity, every drop of oil, and every bit of cement. Many officers and soldiers go to the construction site with "Chairman Mao's Quotations" in hand and a basket on their backs, even picking up a nail that falls into the water in the foundation pit. A certain unit has saved 567,100 yuan in material costs in half a year.

    用毛泽东思想指挥战斗无坚不摧无往不胜
    铁道兵部队获得革命生产双丰收
    很多铁路干线工程任务完成得又快又好，有的干线已提前竣工通车
    据新华社五日讯　在我国南北各地担负着繁重的铁路建设任务的人民解放军铁道兵部队广大指战员，认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产，全部队到处呈现一片生气勃勃、意气风发的革命、生产双丰收的景象。很多铁路干线的工程任务完成得一月比一月好；有的部队一个季度就完成了相当于半年的工程任务；有的部队在开挖隧道中首创双口月成洞全国最新纪录；有的部队提前九十五天完成年度隧道施工和国家投资计划。现在，有的铁路干线已提前竣工正式通车。
    革命带头，生产跃进。这是今年铁道兵部队施工形势的主要特点。广大指战员把活学活用毛主席著作放在先于一切、大于一切、高于一切、重于一切的位置，以“斗私，批修”为纲，猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿所散布的突出技术、工程第一的资产阶级建军路线，大树毛主席的建军路线，突出无产阶级政治，使部队思想革命化产生了新的飞跃，有力地促进了革命、生产双丰收。广大指战员每天清晨起床第一件事是向毛主席像敬礼，祝毛主席万寿无疆，学习毛主席语录，用毛泽东思想指导一天的思想、施工和生活。在施工中大学毛主席语录，大用“老三篇”。劈山开洞的部队，面对着坚硬的巨石，用愚公移山的顽强精神，大声朗诵着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”高唱着用毛主席语录谱成的劳动号子，越唱越有劲，凿通一个个大山，修起一座座隧道。修桥的部队在毛主席关于“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的教导下，冒着零下十多度的严寒，凿开冰窟，在彻骨的冰水中开挖基础，又多又快又好又省地修起一座又一座桥梁。指战员们说：“有了毛泽东思想，就能使高山低头，河水让路，无往不胜，无坚不摧。”
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“要节约闹革命”。在施工中，广大指战员积极开展技术革新、技术革命和增产节约活动，千方百计地节约一块板、一颗钉、一方砂、一度电、一滴油、一撮水泥。很多干部、战士到工地手拿《毛主席语录》，身背背篓，连一颗钉掉到基坑的水中也要把它拣起来。某部队半年来就节约材料费五十六万七千一百余元。
