A friend from South Yemen said that South Yemen's independence is the fruit of armed struggle. "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is a universal truth. Arab public opinion is cheering the victory of the South Yemen people's anti-imperialist struggle.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, on November 29th, on the eve of the founding of the People's Republic of South Yemen, Mustafa Abdul Halik, a South Yemen student studying in Baghdad, said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Chairman Mao Zedong taught us: Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. We South Yemen people follow Chairman Mao's teachings and have been fighting a revolutionary armed struggle against British colonial rule in South Yemen, achieving revolutionary victory."

Halik had participated in anti-British revolutionary activities in South Yemen. He said that without armed struggle, oppressed nations and peoples would not be able to achieve revolutionary victory. The South Yemen people's struggle against British imperialism and for national liberation and independence once again proves that Chairman Mao's teachings are a universal truth.

When talking about the unyielding struggle of the South Yemen people since the British colonialists occupied South Yemen by force in 1839, Halik said: "As Chairman Mao said: 'A single spark can start a prairie fire.' The organized armed revolution that began in the Radfan mountains in 1963 quickly spread throughout South Yemen."

Halik enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong for "developing Marxism-Leninism." He expressed his determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to combine Mao Zedong Thought with his country's specific practices, to carry the revolution through to the end. He denounced those who, while wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, actually betray Marxism-Leninism, peddling the fallacy that oppressed peoples can take power from imperialists and oppressors through peaceful means. He said: "Chairman Mao's teaching that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' speaks for every revolutionary in the world. The founding of the People's Republic of South Yemen is the fruit of the South Yemen people's armed struggle."

According to Xinhua News Agency, on December 2nd, many newspapers in Arab countries warmly hailed the South Yemen people's long-term anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle, achieving national independence. Some newspapers emphasized in their comments that South Yemen's independence is the result of the South Yemen people's insistence on armed struggle.

The Algerian newspaper *Al-Mujahid* pointed out that South Yemen's independence is a victory achieved by the South Yemen people through armed struggle. This victory is first and foremost the result of a people's brave and tenacious struggle against British imperialism.

The Algerian newspaper *Al-Sha'ab* pointed out that South Yemen's independence is the fruit of the South Yemen people's insistence on armed struggle. It said: "The real struggle of the peoples of various countries is not ended with the seizure of power, but should regard the seizure of this power as the starting point for the elimination of all colonial remnants. We are confident that the South Yemen people, relying on their awareness and their fighting experience, will be able to overcome the difficulties and obstacles they encounter on the revolutionary road."

The editorial of the Egyptian newspaper *Al-Ahram* said that South Yemen's independence proves that the people's struggle will inevitably lead to decisive victory.

The editorial of the Iraqi newspaper *Sawt Al-Shabab* congratulated South Yemen's independence and emphasized that armed struggle is the only way for oppressed nations and peoples to achieve liberation. The editorial pointed out that while imperialism, reactionaries, and Zionist forces are trying to extinguish the Arab national liberation movement, South Yemen's independence will further promote the revolutionary struggle of the Arab people.

The editorial of the Iraqi newspaper *Al-Majalla* said that the new independent country should be vigilant against the plots of imperialism. It said: "Imperialism wants to return, and it does not necessarily use the old methods. It is now using new, covert methods."

    南也门朋友说南也门独立是武装斗争的成果
    “枪杆子里面出政权”是普遍真理
    阿拉伯舆论纷纷欢呼南也门人民反帝斗争的胜利
    据新华社巴格达一日电　在巴格达学习的南也门的穆斯塔法·阿卜杜勒·哈利克十一月二十九日晚在南也门人民共和国成立前夕在这里对新华社记者说：“毛泽东主席教导我们：枪杆子里面出政权。我们南也门人民遵循毛主席的这一教导，在南也门坚持反对英国殖民主义当局的革命武装斗争，取得了革命的胜利。”
    哈利克曾经在南也门参加过反英革命活动。他说，没有武装斗争，被压迫民族和人民就不可能取得革命的胜利。南也门人民反对英帝国主义、争取民族解放和独立的斗争，再一次证明了毛主席的教导是普遍真理。
    哈利克在谈到自英国殖民主义者在一八三九年用武力占领南也门以来，南也门人民所进行的不屈不挠的斗争时说：“正如毛泽东主席所说的：‘星星之火，可以燎原’，一九六三年从拉德凡山区开始的有组织的武装革命很快地席卷整个南也门。”
    哈利克热情赞扬伟大领袖毛泽东主席“发展了马克思列宁主义”。他表示决心要活学活用毛主席的著作，把毛泽东思想同他本国的具体实践联系起来，以便把革命进行到底。他痛斥那些披着马克思列宁主义外衣而实际上背叛马克思列宁主义的人贩卖所谓被压迫人民可以通过和平途径从帝国主义和压迫者那里接管政权的谬论。他说：“毛主席关于‘枪杆子里面出政权’的教导说出了全世界每一个革命者的心里话。南也门人民共和国的成立是南也门人民武装斗争的成果。”
    据新华社二日讯　许多阿拉伯国家报纸热烈欢呼南也门人民通过长期的反帝反殖斗争取得的民族独立。一些报纸在评论中强调指出，南也门的独立是南也门人民坚持武装斗争的结果。
    阿尔及利亚《圣战者日报》指出，南也门的独立是南也门人民经过武装斗争所取得的胜利。这一胜利首先是一国人民对英帝国主义进行英勇顽强斗争的结果。
    阿尔及利亚《人民报》指出，南也门独立是南也门人民坚持武装斗争的成果。它说：“各国人民真正的战斗不是以获得政权为结束，而是应该把这个政权的获得当作清除殖民主义一切残余的起点。我们确信，南也门人民依靠他们的觉悟，依靠他们的战斗经验，定能战胜他们在革命路程中所遇到的困难和障碍。”
    阿联《金字塔报》的社论说，南也门的独立证明了人民的斗争不可避免地将导致决定性的胜利。
    伊拉克《工人之声报》发表社论祝贺南也门的独立，并强调指出，武装斗争是被压迫民族和被压迫人民取得解放的唯一道路。社论指出，正当帝国主义、反动派和犹太复国主义势力妄图扑灭阿拉伯民族解放运动的时候，南也门的独立必将进一步推动阿拉伯人民的革命斗争。
    伊拉克《灯塔报》发表评论说，新独立国家要对帝国主义玩弄的阴谋保持警惕。它说：“帝国主义要卷土重来，并不一定采取老一套办法，它现在正在采取新的隐蔽的办法。”
