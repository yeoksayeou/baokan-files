The 1967 Autumn Session of the China Export Commodities Fair, held in Guangzhou, successfully concluded today. Amidst the triumphant songs of the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this session of the fair, held under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, presented a scene of prosperity and flourishing trade from beginning to end. The volume of trade contracts signed far exceeded the planned targets, and the total value of exports and imports also surpassed that of previous sessions.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "More than ninety percent of the world's population are on our side. Our friends are all over the world." The unprecedented scale of this session of the fair once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment. Over the past month, more than seven thousand businessmen from dozens of countries and regions in five continents came to the fair to discuss trade. In addition, more than four thousand foreign friends, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau visited the fair. Businesspeople from various countries and regions, together with the trade delegations at the fair, reached satisfactory import and export trade agreements in a friendly atmosphere based on equality, mutual benefit, and mutual exchange. The fair also received many international friends from economic, cultural, artistic, scientific, transportation, health, news, and friendly organizations from various countries and regions, as well as a large number of foreign sailors for visits. Many foreign friends enthusiastically praised the prosperous scene of the fair, pointing out that the devaluation of the British pound caused great turmoil in the capitalist world, while here, prices are stable, and trade activities are bustling, with China's international trade credibility increasingly high. China is like the rising sun, a country that can be trusted. This once again proves the truth of Chairman Mao's teaching: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will."

The person in charge of the fair announced at the closing ceremony today that during the fair, we discussed more than thirty thousand trade deals with the businesspeople who attended, and the total value of exports and imports far exceeded that of previous sessions. We have achieved great victories both politically and economically. The slanders and sabotage plots of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries against the China Export Commodities Fair have all been thoroughly defeated. This person in charge said, we believe that under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, our people's trade with various countries and regions will further develop, and the friendship between the Chinese people and the people of various countries will continue to deepen.

Many foreign friends pointed out that their strong impression from the fair is that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great political victories and brilliant economic results. China's industrial and agricultural production is developing at an even faster pace. A Latin American friend wrote in the fair's guestbook: This exhibition shows China's strength and is an example of the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese people, educated by Mao Zedong Thought, are selfless and tenacious, making great contributions to the liberation cause of the world. Another foreign friend said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ensures that China's socialist state will remain unchanged for a thousand generations, which is an outstanding contribution to the world revolution. Just as the October Revolution sent Marxism-Leninism to China with a cannon blast, China sent Mao Zedong Thought to the people of the world with another cannon blast, pushing the world revolution into a new era of Mao Zedong Thought.

Foreign friends visiting the fair expressed their unwavering belief and love for the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, through various means. They praised the fair as a great school for spreading Mao Zedong Thought. An African friend said: The fair is a great school of red Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought runs through the entire fair, and Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the fair's activities. A foreign friend, while visiting the exhibition hall of light industrial products, was attracted by the various musical instruments on display. He opened a piano displayed here and excitedly played "The East Is Red," "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman," and "Long Live Chairman Mao." As the solemn music played, many foreign friends in the hall also couldn't help but sing along loudly, and soon the revolutionary songs filled the entire hall. At the book supply department of the fair, every day there were large crowds of compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, overseas Chinese, and foreign friends queuing up to buy "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and works by Mao Zedong, as well as newly issued precious stamps featuring Mao Zedong's portrait. The Mao Zedong badges sold here have been in short supply since the fair opened.

Friends from various countries participating in the fair also visited factories, ports, schools, and rural people's communes, and had extensive contact with revolutionary workers, peasants, and Red Guards. During the visits, foreign friends, overseas compatriots, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau saw a scene of revolutionary fervor and a great situation everywhere. Many foreign friends who visited the people's communes, after seeing the late rice harvest in the Pearl River Delta, pointed out that the facts they saw with their own eyes most powerfully demonstrate: The people's communes, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have once again liberated productivity through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. No one can shake the determination of Chinese revolutionary peasants to follow Chairman Mao on the socialist road.

Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, seeing the unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in their motherland and the firm support of the Chinese people for their struggle against British imperialism, were extremely excited and greatly inspired. They expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary cadres and Red Guards of the motherland, to learn their boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, their boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought, and their revolutionary spirit of rebellion. They will continue to fight against the British imperialism in Hong Kong, to defend the boundless glory of Mao Zedong Thought, and to safeguard the dignity of the great socialist motherland.

The fair held a grand closing reception tonight. More than 2,800 guests, including friends from various countries, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, attended the reception. The reception was filled with cheers of "Long Live Chairman Mao" and the revolutionary song "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman." Friends from five continents gathered together, raising their glasses time and time again to toast the long life of the great leader Chairman Mao. The chairman of the fair, Chen Yu, and the deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Jia Shi, as well as representatives of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, spoke at the reception. Chen Yu, in his speech, warmly congratulated the successful conclusion of this session of the fair, pointing out that this is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

After the reception, the Beijing Opera Troupe performed the revolutionary model opera "Sha Jianhuai" for the world's friends and guests.

　　伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命
　　在政治上取得伟大的胜利在经济上取得辉煌的成果
　　一九六七年秋季中国出口商品交易会在广州胜利闭幕
    新华社广州十五日电　在广州举办的一九六七年秋季中国出口商品交易会，今天胜利闭幕。在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的凯歌声中举办的这届交易会，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自始至终呈现着繁荣兴旺的景象，成交的贸易合同大大超过了预定计划，出口和进口的贸易总额也大大超过了历届交易会。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“全世界百分之九十以上的人民大众在我们一边。我们的朋友遍天下。”这届交易会的空前盛况，又一次证明了毛主席的这一英明论断。一个月来，共有五大洲的数十个国家和地区的七千多名客商到会洽谈贸易业务，此外，还有四千多名外国朋友、海外华侨和港澳同胞，来到交易会进行了参观。各国、各地区的贸易界人士，和交易会的各交易团在友好的气氛中，在平等互利、互通有无的基础上，普遍达成了满意的进出口贸易合同。交易会还接待了许多国家和地区的经济、文化、艺术、科学、交通、卫生、新闻、友好团体的国际朋友和大批外国海员到会参观。许多外国朋友热烈赞扬交易会繁荣兴旺的景象，他们指出，英镑贬值在资本主义世界引起了极大的混乱，而这里却巍若泰山，物价稳定，交易活动一直繁忙进行，国际贸易信誉越来越高，中国如旭日东升，是最可信赖的国家。这再一次证明了毛主席教导的真理：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”
    交易会的负责人在今天闭幕时宣布说，交易会期间，我们同到会的贸易界人士洽谈了三万多笔交易，达成的出口、进口贸易总额大大超过了历届交易会。我们在政治上、经济上都取得了伟大胜利，帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派对中国出口商品交易会的一切造谣诬蔑和阴谋破坏，都遭到了彻底的失败。这位负责人说，我们相信，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，我国人民同世界各国各地区的贸易往来，必将进一步得到发展，中国人民同各国人民之间的友谊必将日益增进。
    许多外国朋友指出，他们在交易会上得到的强烈印象是：中国无产阶级文化大革命在政治上取得了伟大胜利，在经济上也取得了辉煌的成果。中国的工农业生产正以更大的速度飞跃发展。一位拉丁美洲朋友在交易会的留言簿上写道：这个展览会表明了中国的强大，是中国人民在毛泽东思想指引下取得伟大胜利的一个范例。用毛泽东思想教育出来的中国人民，大公无私，英勇顽强，为全世界的解放事业作出了巨大的贡献。一位外国朋友还说：“无产阶级文化大革命使中国社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色，这是对世界革命的杰出贡献。正如十月革命一声炮响，把马克思列宁主义送到中国，中国又是一声炮响，把毛泽东思想传给全世界人民，把世界革命推上了毛泽东思想的新时代。”
    参观交易会的各国朋友通过各种方式，表达了他们对世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席的无比信仰和无比热爱。他们赞扬交易会是传播毛泽东思想的大学校。一位非洲朋友说：交易会是红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。毛泽东思想贯穿着整个交易会的始终，毛泽东思想是交易会活动的灵魂。一位外国朋友在参观交易会轻工业品陈列大厅时，被这里展出的各种乐器吸引住了，他打开陈列在这里的钢琴，兴奋地演奏了《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和《万岁，毛主席》等歌曲。随着庄严的乐曲，在大厅里的许多外国朋友也情不自禁地跟着高声歌唱，顿时革命歌声充满着整个大厅。在交易会的书刊供应部，每天都有大批港澳同胞、华侨和外国朋友来到这里排队购买《毛主席语录》和毛主席著作以及新发行的印有毛主席像的珍贵邮票。这里出售的毛主席像章，从交易会开幕以来，一直供不应求。
    来自世界各国的朋友参加交易会期间，还参观了工厂、港口、学校和农村人民公社，同广大革命工人、农民以及红卫兵小将进行了广泛的接触。在参观中，各国朋友、海外侨胞和港澳同胞看到到处是热气腾腾的革命景象和一派大好形势。许多参观了人民公社的外国朋友看到珠江三角洲晚稻一片丰收的景象以后指出，他们亲眼看到的事实最有力地表明：人民公社在毛主席革命路线的指引下，经过无产阶级文化大革命，又一次解放了生产力。任何人也无法动摇中国革命农民最坚定地跟着毛主席走社会主义道路的决心。
    参加交易会的港九同胞，看到祖国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势，看到祖国人民对港九同胞反英抗暴斗争的坚决支持，都异常兴奋，受到了巨大鼓舞。他们表示，一定要向祖国无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将学习，学习他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限忠诚，对毛泽东思想的无限信仰，学习他们的革命造反精神，大造特造港英帝国主义的反，为捍卫光焰无际的毛泽东思想，维护伟大社会主义祖国的尊严，誓把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    交易会在今晚举行了盛大的闭幕招待会。出席招待会的各国朋友、海外华侨和港澳同胞等共有二千八百多人。招待会上响彻着“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声和《大海航行靠舵手》的革命歌声。来自五大洲的朋友欢聚一堂，一再举杯共祝伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆。交易会主任委员陈郁、对外贸易部副部长贾石以及无产阶级革命派代表在会上讲了话。陈郁在讲话中热烈祝贺这届交易会的圆满成功，指出这是我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    招待会结束后，北京京剧一团为世界各国朋友和来宾们演出了革命现代京剧样板戏《沙家浜》。
