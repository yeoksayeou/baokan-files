In 1958, revolutionary teachers and students, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor," launched an unprecedented educational revolution. At that time, the broad revolutionary masses were jubilant, while China's Khrushchev labeled the educational revolution with charges such as "learning quality may also decline." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi also cursed the educational revolution as "chaotic, bad, and biased," and falsely claimed that there was a danger of a general decline in educational quality. He also shouted, "Extend the study period for three and a half universities.... Cooperative Medical College should have an eight-year system. The old Cooperative Medical College had many good systems, which have been completely destroyed in recent years."

Thus, the school system became longer and longer. In the autumn of 1959, a so-called "small pagoda system" of "the cream of the cream," the eight-year system of China Medical University, was born. It "inherited drop by drop" the entire set of experiences of the American imperialists running the old Cooperative Medical College, becoming a school with the longest school system and the heaviest curriculum.

The Black Goods of the Eight-Year System

The long eight-year system provided good conditions for the bourgeoisie to "carve and polish" their successors.

Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized the need to strengthen ideological and political work for young students, pointing out: "Without correct political views, it is as if there is no soul." However, China's Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi raised the banner of bourgeois "intellectual education first," opposing the prominence of proletarian politics.

In the old medical university, there was no guarantee of time for political activities and party activities. The school explicitly stipulated that "self-study time is not allowed to read newspapers or study Chairman Mao's works." The political courses, which accounted for only 3.5% of the total class hours, taught the same old stuff as "Cultivation." Bourgeois intellectuals used the podium to wage one battle after another with the proletariat for the hearts and minds of the youth. An internal medicine professor from the bourgeoisie held up a stethoscope and raised his hands to say, "With these two things, you can travel the world." Some extremely reactionary sentences were included as examples in the English textbooks; while quoting Chairman Mao's sayings in the textbooks was cut out by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party. It is proven that China's Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi advocating "intellectual education first" is a complete fraud. They opposed the prominence of proletarian politics precisely to promote bourgeois politics.

The old medical university had an unusually large number of courses, and the students' burden was extremely heavy.

The three-year preparatory course was boasted as the "advantage" and "feature" of the old medical university, claiming to prepare a "strong" foundation of natural science theory and foreign language for scientific research. Therefore, mathematics, physics, and biology were taught as much as in engineering schools, and chemistry was taught as much as in the chemistry department. Learning so much mathematics, physics, and chemistry was actually unnecessary for becoming a doctor. Moreover, students forgot it as soon as they left the preparatory course.

In the undergraduate course, it was equivalent to entering the old Cooperative Medical College. Whatever the old Cooperative Medical College taught, it was all copied verbatim. No room was left for students to participate in production labor and class struggle.

The heavy curriculum pressed the students to the point of breathlessness. The average daily study time was as long as fifteen hours. When it came to the eighth-year internship, a 24-hour responsibility system was implemented. Students were kept in the wards all day, practicing so-called basic skills.

During exams, students were treated as enemies, with surprise attacks, and strange questions were asked. During the exam period, "burning the midnight oil" became even more common than usual.

China's Khrushchev and his henchmen also sought luxury in material facilities, making students live a life detached from the working people for a long time. Lu Dingyi even specially approved that the old medical university could have more holidays, less labor, and even no labor at all.

In the long eight years, young students were detached from class struggle, production labor, and the working masses. How dangerous this is!

The Evil Results of the Eight-Year System

Chairman Mao taught us: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop in terms of ideology, intelligence, and physical education, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." He also repeatedly taught us to temper ourselves in the great storms of revolution to become successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

The old medical university operated for eight years and trained fifty graduates. Let us see what evil results the eight-year system brought to young students!

Due to the long-term poisoning of bourgeois stench, some young students were infected, and a few even took the path of crime. Many young students were infected with serious bourgeois medical practices. When they went to the countryside, the problems became even more exposed. Some people could not even endure a short period of hard life.

The old medical university was famous for its long reading time and strict professional requirements, so the graduates should be proficient in their work, right? The fact is the opposite.

Those bourgeois "experts," "authorities," and "ancestors" vigorously advocated a "theory" that "doing theory is high-level, and doing clinical practice is low-level." They talked big, from the cause of the disease to the mechanism, from the pathology to the diagnosis, but did not pay attention to how to solve the actual problems of the patients. Students read a lot, listened to a lot of lectures, but had few opportunities to independently handle patients, so their actual work ability was very poor. The old medical university students were called "theoretical doctors," which is indeed a bitter satire!

Students spent a long time studying and memorizing countless foreign frameworks and dead dogmas, making it difficult to get rid of them. Those bourgeois "experts," "authorities," and "ancestors" knelt down to the ancients and foreigners in treatment, adhered to old rules, and had no creativity. This "disease" also infected young students.

Those bourgeois "experts," "authorities," and "ancestors" were only interested in those "high-level diseases" and ignored the common and frequently occurring diseases that harm the health of the broad working people. Therefore, students lacked knowledge of common and frequently occurring diseases and could not truly serve the broad working people.

Students spent a lot of time learning to master various precise, expensive, and cumbersome instruments. However, it is not just the countryside, but even general hospitals do not have these instruments. This made students feel that they could not walk without crutches as soon as they left the large hospital.

The old medical university's internship was a specialized internship, that is, each person specialized in one subject. This method reflected pure metaphysics. Moreover, doctors trained in this way must have a complete set of personnel, otherwise, they cannot work independently. They cannot go to factories and countryside to serve the working people.

The long eight-year system also severely damaged the physical health of young students. In the old medical university, the annual dropout rate due to illness was as high as 15%.

"The old medical university, eight years of study, really harms people. Three years of study, not touching the edge of medicine. Five years of study, not touching the edge of patients. Eight years of study, not touching the edge of workers and peasants." This catchphrase is a vivid portrayal of the old medical university's implementation of the revisionist educational line.

The Complete Failure of the Eight-Year System

The old medical university, as a model of China's Khrushchev and his henchmen promoting a long school system, had a very bad influence both domestically and internationally. Domestic medical and pharmaceutical colleges all followed the old medical university. The urban lord Ministry of Health decided in 1962 to gradually extend all medical colleges to a six-year system in batches.

China's Khrushchev and his henchmen's counter-revolutionary actions of restoring capitalism in the old medical university encountered resolute opposition from revolutionary teachers and students from the beginning. However, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party used a combination of soft and hard methods to brutally suppress the revolutionary actions of the young comrades. Lu Dingyi had repeatedly stolen the name of the Central Committee to say: "The eight-year medical university must be continued.... In the future, it is not allowed to discuss whether to continue or not."

In June 1966, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao personally ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary forces of the old medical university, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rebelled against the small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. The eight-year system carefully crafted by China's Khrushchev and his henchmen was completely ruined!

Today, we must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take "criticizing revisionism and combating selfishness" as the key link, and thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev!

　　彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的八年制
　　中国医科大学革命委员会
    一九五八年，广大革命师生在毛主席“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针指引下，掀起了一场史无前例的教育革命。当时，广大革命群众欢欣鼓舞，而中国赫鲁晓夫却给教育革命扣上了“学习质量也可能下降”等罪名。反革命修正主义分子陆定一也大骂教育革命“乱、糟、偏”，并胡说什么出现了“教育质量普遍降低的危险”。他还叫嚷：“把三个半大学延长学习年限。……协和搞八年。”“旧协和有好些好制度，这些东西这几年给我们搞得光光的。”
    于是，学制越来越长。一九五九年秋天，一所被称为“小宝塔系统”的“尖中之尖”的八年制中国医科大学，就这样出生了。它“点滴不漏地继承了”美帝国主义在中国办旧协和医学院的一整套经验，成了一所学制最长、课程最重的学校。
    八年制贩卖的黑货
    漫长的八年制，为资产阶级“精雕细刻”自己的接班人，提供了良好的条件。
    毛主席一再强调对青年学生“需要加强思想政治工作”，还指出：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”而中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流，则打起资产阶级“智育第一”的破旗，反对突出无产阶级政治。
    在旧医大，政治活动和党团活动的时间根本没有保证。学校明文规定，“自习时间不许看报和学毛主席著作”。仅占总学时百分之三点五的政治课，讲的又是《修养》的那一套。资产阶级知识分子利用讲台，同无产阶级进行一场又一场激烈的争夺青年的战斗。内科一个资产阶级教授拿出一只听诊器，举起双手对学生说：“有这两样，就可以走遍天下。”一些极端反动的句子被作为例句编入英语教材里；而在教材中引用毛主席语录，却被党内一小撮走资派一刀砍掉。事实证明，中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流鼓吹“智育第一”，完全是一个骗局。他们反对突出无产阶级政治，就是为了突出资产阶级政治。
    旧医大的课程设置多得出奇，学生负担重得要命。
    预科三年被夸耀为旧医大的“优点”和“特点”，说是为了从事科学研究准备“强大的”自然科学理论和外文基础的。因此，数学、物理学念得同工科院校一样多，生物课同生物系学的一样，化学课同化学系学的一样多。学习这么多的数理化，对做医生实际上没有必要。并且，学生离开预科就忘了。
    到本科，就等于进了旧协和医学院。凡是旧协和要讲的东西，全部照本宣科。没有为学生参加生产劳动和阶级斗争留下任何位置。
    繁重的课程压得学生喘不过气来。学习时间平均每天长达十五小时之多。而到了八年级实习时，则实行二十四小时负责制。学生整天被关在病房里，大练所谓基本功。
    考试时把学生当敌人，实行突然袭击，并且出偏题，出怪题。每到期考阶段，“开夜车”就比平时更为普遍。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙们还在物质设备上力求奢华，使学生在这里长期过着脱离劳动人民的生活。陆定一更特别批准旧医大可以多放假，少劳动，甚至可以不劳动。
    青年学生在漫长的八年中，脱离阶级斗争，脱离生产劳动，脱离工农群众。这是多么的危险呀！
    八年制的恶果
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”他还谆谆教导我们到革命的大风大浪中锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    旧医大办了八年，培养了五十名毕业生。在这里，让我们看看八年制给青年学生带来了什么样的恶果吧！
    由于资产阶级臭气的长期熏染，一些青年学生中了毒，个别的甚至走上了犯罪的道路。不少青年学生沾染了严重的资产阶级医疗作风。到了农村，问题就更突出地暴露了。有些人连短期的艰苦生活也过不惯。
    八年制的旧医大是以读书多、业务要求严而著称的，那末，毕业生在业务上总应该是过硬的吧！事实完全相反。
    那些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”和“祖师爷”极力宣扬一种“理论”，即所谓“搞理论是高级的，搞临床实践是低级的”。他们夸夸其谈，从病因到机制，从病理到诊断，就是不重视如何解决病人的实际问题。学生读书多，听讲多，而独立处理病人的机会却很少，因而实际工作能力就很差。旧医大学生被人称为“理论医生”，这真是一个辛辣的讽刺！
    学生长期闭门读书，在脑子里树起了数不清的洋框框、死教条，简直难以摆脱。那些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”和“祖师爷”，在治疗上拜倒在古人洋人的脚下，墨守成规，毫无创造性。这种“顽症”也传染给了青年学生。
    那些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”和“祖师爷”只有兴趣讲那些“高级病”，而无视危害广大劳动人民身体健康的常见病、多发病。因此，学生缺乏常见病、多发病的知识，也就不能真正地为广大劳动人民服务了。
    学生为了学习掌握各种精密、昂贵和笨重的仪器，花费了大量的时间。但是不用说农村，就是一般医院也都没有这些仪器。这就使得学生一离开大医院，就感到离了拐杖走不了路。
    旧医大的实习是实行专科实习的，即每人专攻一科。这种办法反映出十足的形而上学。而且，用这种办法培养出来的医生一定要配齐一整套人马，否则就不能独立工作。他们是不能下厂下乡为劳动人民服务的。
    漫长的八年制还使青年学生的身体受到极大的摧残。在旧医大，每年因病留级退学的就高达百分之十五。
    “旧医大，学八年，害人真不浅。学三年，不沾医学边。学五年，不沾病人边。学八年，不沾工农边。”这个顺口溜是对旧医大执行修正主义教育路线活生生的写照。
    八年制的彻底破产
    旧医大作为中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙们推行长学制的标本，在国内外起了极为恶劣的影响。国内各医药院校纷纷向旧医大看齐。城市老爷卫生部在一九六二年就决定分批分期地把所有医学院都延长为六年制。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙们在旧医大复辟资本主义的反革命行径，一开始就遭到了革命师生的坚决反对。但是，党内一小撮走资派采用软硬兼施的手段，把小将们的革命行动蛮横地压制下去。陆定一曾多次盗用中央名义说：“八年制医大要办下去，……今后不准再讨论办不办的问题。”
    一九六六年六月，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。旧医大的无产阶级革命派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，造了党内一小撮走资派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”的反。中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙们精心炮制的八年制彻底完蛋了！
    今天，我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线批倒，批臭！
