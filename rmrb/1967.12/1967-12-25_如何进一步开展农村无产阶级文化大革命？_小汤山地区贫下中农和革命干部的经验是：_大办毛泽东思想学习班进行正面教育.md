The experience of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the Xiaotangshan area is: hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes for positive education.

The Beijing suburbs' Changping County Xiaotangshan area's broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres have reached a consensus on how to further carry out the rural cultural revolution: "Holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes for positive education is good!"

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, mainly composed of the People's Liberation Army's "support the left" troops, has extensively carried out work in the six communes of the Xiaotangshan area. After more than a year of the proletarian cultural revolution, the masses have been fully mobilized, and the revolutionary and production situation is excellent. Most of the rural cadres are good or relatively good. The vast majority of them come from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and insist on the socialist road. During the cultural revolution, they have been tempered and tested. Some of them have made mistakes, mainly in terms of style, attitude, and methods. Based on the experience of holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the Xiaotangshan area over the past few months, positive education can achieve good results in further carrying out the cultural revolution in rural areas.

The main method of positive education in the Xiaotangshan area is to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. From mid-October to the end of November, the six communes in this area held a total of 466 commune and brigade-level study classes, with 16,518 participants. At the same time, most production teams also held Mao Zedong Thought night schools, with some night schools having white-haired elders and children in their teens studying Chairman Mao's works and the latest directives together.

The study classes are generally divided into two stages: the first stage focuses on "criticizing selfishness," combined with "criticizing revisionism," mainly solving the problems of revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination at the commune and brigade levels; the second stage focuses on "criticizing revisionism," combined with "criticizing selfishness," mainly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev, the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and their agents in Changping, and eliminating their poisonous influence.

The study classes use Chairman Mao's latest directives and the article "Two Roads in China's Countryside" as the main teaching materials. They start with ideological education. Some students said that ideological education is a key to opening up one's mind, which can solve the problem of understanding the cultural revolution and guide everyone to correctly treat the masses and themselves. The deputy secretary of the Party branch of Baoyuan Commune's Baojuguan Brigade, Li Chunying, had some shortcomings and mistakes in her work. During the movement, she was criticized by the masses and had a sense of grievance. After studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, she suddenly became enlightened. She said, "Chairman Mao has opened up a new path for the world revolution, and I am still stuck in Baojuguan, worrying about my own problems!" The next day, she took the lead in criticizing and fighting against her selfishness, which was praised by everyone.

Next, they focus on class education. People say that recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness is a bridge to "criticizing selfishness and revisionism." Through the contrast between the past and the present, the students love Chairman Mao even more. They realize from their personal experiences that only by overthrowing the "self" and criticizing the "revisionist" can they advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The secretary of the Party branch of Datangshan Brigade, Li Shiqing, originally thought that he had not embezzled or stolen, and that he was busy running around for the brigade every day, so he was not satisfied with the big-character posters criticizing him. At the recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness meeting, he recalled the bitter life of his family fleeing famine and begging in the old society, and himself herding pigs for the landlord barefoot in winter. He finally understood why the masses criticized him so severely for "small reclamation" and "private plots." He said painfully, "Chairman Mao led us to rise up and walk on the socialist road. I, however, forgot my roots and followed the Chinese Khrushchev!" The students were full of anger as they denounced the Chinese Khrushchev, realizing that his proposals of "exploitation has merit," "three autonomies and one contract," and "four freedoms" were to restore capitalism and to make the poor and lower-middle peasants suffer again. In this way, everyone became more determined to walk the socialist road.

The third step is to deeply study the "Three Articles." The students said that Zhang Zedong, White Agnes, and the Old Fool are good examples for us to criticize selfishness and revisionism. At the first study class in Dadianliu Commune, the cadres discussed the issue of "whether it is a loss to be a cadre." An old cadre from a poor peasant background said, "Whether it is a loss or not depends on what standpoint you take. From the standpoint of 'self,' it is a loss; from the standpoint of seizing power for the poor and lower-middle peasants, it is not a loss." Some people checked their wrong thoughts of wanting to "throw down their burden" and not daring to manage behaviors that harm collective interests on the spot. Everyone expressed that they would definitely serve the people wholeheartedly and achieve new merits in the proletarian cultural revolution.

The study classes have consistently adhered to the red line of the two-line struggle, and the essence of the struggle is the struggle between public and private. The women's federation director of Cuicun Commune, Wang Xiuhua, said well, "Without criticizing selfishness, people will change; without criticizing revisionism, the country will change." Through the study, the two opposing factions united; the cadres who "threw down their burden" picked up their burdens again; "enemies" became "red pairs." Mao Zedong Thought became the criterion for examining the thoughts and actions of the students; the Chinese Khrushchev became a pile of filth despised by humanity.

Regarding the leadership of positive education, the practice in the Xiaotangshan area is: in places where the revolutionary committee of the commune has been established, such as Cuicun and Dadianliu communes, the main task is for revolutionary leading cadres to go deep into the brigades and production teams, understand the situation, grasp the direction, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, and help to run the study classes well; in places where the revolutionary committee of the commune has not been established, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team goes deep into the communes and brigades to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize the masses to run the study classes well by themselves, and lay a good foundation for establishing a sound leading cadre team.

Will positive education make the movement go through the motions, and will it allow class enemies to slip away? The initial experience of some communes and brigades in the Xiaotangshan area proves: it will not. As long as we fully trust the masses and arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, we can gradually unite the majority of the masses and cadres, distinguish right from wrong, and differentiate between enemies and us, and further carry out the rural cultural revolution.

    如何进一步开展农村无产阶级文化大革命？
    小汤山地区贫下中农和革命干部的经验是：
    大办毛泽东思想学习班进行正面教育
    本报讯　“大办毛泽东思想学习班，以斗私，批修为纲，进行正面教育好！”这是北京郊区昌平县小汤山地区广大社员群众和革命干部，对进一步开展农村文化大革命的共同意见。
    以中国人民解放军支左部队为主组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，在小汤山地区六个公社，广泛地进行了工作。这个地区经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命，群众已经充分发动起来，革命和生产形势一片大好。农村广大干部多数是好的或比较好的。他们绝大多数出身于贫农下中农，热爱党，热爱毛主席，坚持走社会主义道路。在文化大革命中，他们又经受了锻炼和考验。他们之中有些人犯了错误，主要是属于作风、态度和方法上的问题。根据几个月来小汤山地区大办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，在农村进一步开展文化大革命，进行正面教育，可以取得很好的效果。
    小汤山地区进行正面教育的主要方法，是开办毛泽东思想学习班。十月中旬至十一月底，这个地区的六个公社共开办公社、大队级的学习班四百六十六个，参加学习的有一万六千五百一十八人。同时，大部分生产队还举办了毛泽东思想夜校，有的夜校有白发苍苍的老人，有十几岁的娃娃，共同学习毛主席的著作和最新指示。
    学习班大体分为两个阶段：第一阶段以“斗私”为主，结合“批修”，着重解决公社、大队的革命大联合和革命三结合的问题；第二阶段，以“批修”为主，结合“斗私”，着重批判中国赫鲁晓夫、旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团及其在昌平的代理人在农村推行的反革命修正主义路线，肃清其流毒。
    学习班以毛主席的最新指示和《中国农村两条道路的斗争》一文为主要教材。首先从形势教育入手。有的学员说，形势教育是打开心窍的一把钥匙，可以解决对文化大革命的认识问题，引导大家正确对待群众，正确对待自己。上苑公社暴峪泉大队党支部副书记李春英，过去工作中有些缺点和错误，在运动中受到群众的批评，有委屈情绪。学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，她豁然开朗了。她说：“毛主席给世界革命开辟了新的道路，我还坐在暴峪泉围着自己的问题转呢！”第二天，她带头亮私斗私，受到了大家的赞扬。
    其次，大抓阶级教育。人们说，忆苦思甜是引向“斗私，批修”的桥梁。通过今昔对比，学员们更加热爱毛主席。他们从亲身经历中认识到，只有斗倒“私”字，批臭“修”字，才能沿着毛主席的革命路线不断前进。大汤山大队党支部书记李士清，原来觉得自己一没贪污，二没盗窃，整天为队里东跑西奔，对群众贴大字报批评自己很不满意。在忆苦思甜会上，他回想起在旧社会全家逃荒要饭，自己冬天光着脚给地主放猪的悲惨生活，终于懂得了群众为什么对自己大搞“小开荒”、“自留地”提出那么严厉的批评。他沉痛地说：“毛主席领导我们翻了身，走上社会主义大道。我却忘了本，跟着中国赫鲁晓夫跑了！”学员们满腔怒火地控诉中国赫鲁晓夫，认清了他提出的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”，就是要复辟资本主义，就是要让贫农下中农重吃二遍苦。这样，大家更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心。
    第三步，是大学“老三篇”。学员说，张思德、白求恩、老愚公，是我们斗私批修的好榜样。在大东流公社第一期学习班上，干部们讨论了“当干部吃亏不吃亏”的问题。一个老贫农出身的大队长说：“吃亏不吃亏，要看站在什么立场上看。站在‘私’字立场上看就是吃亏；从为贫农下中农掌权来看，就是不吃亏。”有的人当场检查了想“撂挑子”、对待损害集体利益的行为不敢管的错误思想。大家纷纷表示，今后一定要完全彻底地为人民服务，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
    学习班自始至终贯串着两条路线斗争的红线，斗争的实质就是公与私的斗争。崔村公社妇联主任王秀华说得好：“不斗私，人要变；不批修，国要变。”通过学习，长期对立的两派联合了；“撂挑子”的干部重新挑起了重担；“冤家”结成了“一对红”。毛泽东思想成为检验学员的思想和行动的准则；中国赫鲁晓夫成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
    关于正面教育的领导问题，小汤山地区的作法是：已成立了公社革命委员会的地方，例如崔村、大东流等公社，主要由革命的领导干部深入大队、生产队，了解情况，掌握方向，依靠贫农下中农和革命干部，帮助办好学习班；没有成立公社革命委员会的地方，则由毛泽东思想宣传队，深入社队宣传毛泽东思想，发动群众自己办好学习班，为健全领导班子打好基础。
    正面教育会不会使运动走过场，会不会让阶级敌人滑过去？小汤山地区一些社队的初步经验证明：不会。坚持正面教育，只要充分相信群众，只要用毛泽东思想武装群众，就可以逐步团结群众和干部的大多数，分清是非，区别敌我，使农村文化大革命进一步开展起来。
