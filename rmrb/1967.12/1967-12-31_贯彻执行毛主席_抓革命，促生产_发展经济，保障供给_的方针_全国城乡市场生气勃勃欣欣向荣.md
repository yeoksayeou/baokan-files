In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and workers in the financial and commercial sectors of our country have resolutely implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's guidelines of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "develop the economy, ensure supply." The urban and rural markets present a vibrant and prosperous scene.

Currently, whether in cities or rural areas, the supply of goods in our country is relatively abundant, truly achieving a situation where both sales and purchases are brisk and prices are stable. The supply of grain is improving. The supply of meat, vegetables, fruits, and other sideline products has increased. The supply of daily-use industrial products basically meets the needs of the broad masses of people. The sales volume of cotton cloth, cotton and wool knitwear, and other knitted cotton products this year has increased compared to last year. The sales volume of sewing machines, radios, thermos bottles, enamel basins, aluminum pots, and other daily-use items has increased by about 15% compared to last year. To meet the needs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supply of paper, ink, and wax paper and other cultural supplies has increased several times compared to last year.

The vibrant and prosperous situation in the urban and rural markets of our country is inseparable from the development of industrial and agricultural production. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers in our country have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, achieving new developments in industrial production, especially in light industry and textile industry production, providing a solid material foundation for the prosperity of the socialist market. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural people's communes have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," achieving an unprecedented all-around bumper harvest in agricultural production. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have enthusiastically handed over their bumper harvests of grain, cotton, oil crops, and other agricultural and sideline products to the state. Due to the development of industrial and agricultural production, the purchasing power of urban and rural people, especially the broad masses of peasants, has greatly increased, reflected in the market by a significant increase in the total sales volume of goods compared to last year. The sales volume of some major daily-use industrial products has increased notably.

In 1966 and 1967, the state adjusted the prices of some commodities, and the prices of some daily-use industrial products and agricultural production materials have been reduced to varying degrees. The price adjustments over the past two years mainly lowered the prices of some industrial products in remote areas and mountainous regions, making the national price level more reasonable between regions.

After further eliminating the Four Olds and establishing the Four News in 1967, the urban and rural markets have presented a new and vibrant scene, clearly showing the characteristics of our country's socialist commerce. Many trademarks and designs have added content reflecting the new situation of our country's socialist revolution and construction. Business premises and display windows have posted or displayed Chairman Mao's portraits, Chairman Mao's quotations, and slogans praising the great leader Chairman Mao. The broad revolutionary cadres and workers in the financial and commercial sectors have also taken the People's Liberation Army as an example, actively propagating the great thought of Mao Zedong, turning the market into a bastion for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers in the financial and commercial sectors have launched a vigorous revolutionary criticism movement, fiercely criticizing the fallacies of "material incentives," "profit-first," and opening "free markets" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the financial and commercial sectors, further establishing the thought of serving the people. They face the countryside and the masses, go deep into the masses and the grassroots, help the masses organize production, and arrange life. They have made contributions to ensuring the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Currently, the broad revolutionary cadres and workers in the financial and commercial sectors of our country are closely following the strategic deployment of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, actively responding to Chairman Mao's call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," and have set up many classes for studying Mao Zedong Thought, launching a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Through study, they have powerfully promoted the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the financial and commercial sectors, further promoting the revolutionization of the thoughts and work of the broad financial and commercial cadres and workers. They have resolutely declared that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the financial and commercial sectors to the end, and turn the financial and commercial sectors into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”“发展经济，保障供给”的方针
    全国城乡市场生气勃勃欣欣向荣
    据新华社三十日讯　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国财贸战线广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，坚决贯彻伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”和“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，城乡市场呈现一派欣欣向荣的景象。
    现在，我国不论城市和乡村，商品供应都比较充足，真正做到了购销两旺，物价稳定。粮食供应情况越来越好，肉类、蔬菜、水果等副食品的供应量，都有所增长。日用工业品的供应，基本上适应了广大人民的生活需要。棉布、棉毛衫裤等针棉织品今年的销售量比去年有了增加，缝纫机、收音机、热水瓶、搪瓷面盆、铝锅等日用百货的销售量，比去年增长了百分之十五左右。适应无产阶级文化大革命的需要，纸张、墨汁、蜡纸等文化用品的供应量，比去年有了成倍的增长。
    我国城乡市场这种生气勃勃的大好形势，是同工农业生产的发展分不开的。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国广大工人阶级活学活用毛主席著作，夺得了工业生产，特别是轻工业、纺织工业生产的新发展，为社会主义市场的繁荣提供了雄厚的物质基础。我国农村人民公社广大贫下中农社员，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，夺得了农业生产的空前全面大丰收。广大贫下中农社员踊跃把丰收的粮食、棉花、油料和其它农副产品交售给国家。由于工农业生产的发展，城乡人民的购买力，特别是广大农民的购买力大大提高，反映在市场上，商品的销售总额比去年有较大的增长。一些主要日用工业品的销售量，增长尤为显著。
    在一九六六年和一九六七年，国家对部分商品的价格作了调整，某些日用工业品和农业生产资料的价格有了不同程度的降低。去今两年调整物价，主要是降低了边远地区和山区的部分工业品的价格，使全国物价水平在地区之间更加合理。
    城乡市场经过一九六七年的进一步破四旧，立四新，出现了一派崭新气象，鲜明地显示出我国社会主义商业的特色。许多商标图案上增添了反映我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设新风貌的内容。营业场所和橱窗里，张贴或陈设了毛主席像、毛主席语录和歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的标语。财贸战线的广大革命职工还以解放军为榜样，积极宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，把商场变成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，财贸战线广大革命职工开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判运动，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫和他在财贸战线上的代理人所鼓吹的“物质刺激”、“利润挂帅”和开放“自由市场”等复辟资本主义的谬论，进一步树立了为人民服务的思想，他们面向农村，面向群众，深入群众，深入基层，帮助群众组织生产，安排生活。为保证无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展作出了贡献。
    当前，我国财贸战线的广大革命职工，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席的战略部署，积极响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，开办了许多毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。通过学习，有力地推动了财贸战线的革命大联合和革命三结合，进一步促进了广大财贸职工思想和工作的革命化。他们坚决表示，一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把财贸战线的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把财贸战线办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
