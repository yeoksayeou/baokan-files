The Chinese East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe has been performing in Tanzania's Zanzibar for ten days, staging eight revolutionary song and dance performances. They have been warmly welcomed and praised by people from all walks of life in Zanzibar.

Many spectators said that these performances are "a new type of proletarian art nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought." Many workers in Zanzibar said after watching the performances: Today, revolutionary people all over the world love Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao forward.

The East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe performed a special show for the Tanzanian People's Defense Force in Zanzibar. When the great image of Chairman Mao in a green military uniform appeared on the screen, Tanzanian soldiers applauded enthusiastically.

After the performance, four soldiers went on stage to express their love for the great leader Chairman Mao by singing the Chinese song "The East Is Red" in Chinese. Another soldier said: "We sincerely thank Chairman Mao for sending Chinese cultural workers to Tanzania. These songs and dances show the road of revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. The peoples of Asia and Africa should also follow this road to achieve thorough liberation."

In the small town of Makunduchi at the southern end of Zanzibar Island, many villagers lined the streets to welcome the Chinese cultural workers. The East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe performed revolutionary songs and dances in an open-air venue for the local people, also receiving a warm welcome. One spectator said: No matter how much the imperialists curse, Mao Zedong Thought is spreading all over the world.

On the evening of the 6th, the Chinese Consulate in Zanzibar held a reception for the visit and performance of the East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe. Ali Sultan Issa, the Minister of Education and National Culture of Zanzibar, and about 200 guests attended the reception.

    据新华社桑给巴尔六日电 中国东方红歌舞团十天来在坦桑尼亚的桑给巴尔演出了八场革命歌舞，受到桑给巴尔各界人民的热烈欢迎和赞扬。
    许多观众说，这些演出是“毛泽东思想哺育的新型的无产阶级文艺”。许多桑给巴尔工人在观看演出以后说：今天全世界革命人民都热爱毛主席，跟着毛主席前进。
    东方红歌舞团在桑给巴尔曾为坦桑尼亚人民国防军部队作了专场演出。当毛主席身穿草绿色军装的伟大形象在天幕上出现时，坦桑尼亚军人热烈鼓掌。
    演出结束后，四位士兵为了表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，走上舞台，用中国话高唱中国歌曲《东方红》。另一位士兵说：“我们衷心感谢毛主席派中国文艺工作者到坦桑尼亚来。这些歌舞表现了中国人民革命斗争的道路。亚非各国人民也应当走这条道路，以取得彻底解放。”
    在桑给巴尔岛南端的小镇马孔杜奇，许多村民夹道欢迎中国文艺工作者。东方红歌舞团在露天场地上为当地人民表演了革命歌舞，也受到热烈欢迎。一位观众说：不管帝国主义者怎样咒骂，毛泽东思想正在传遍全世界。
    六日晚，中国驻桑给巴尔领事馆为东方红歌舞团的访问演出举行招待会。桑给巴尔教育和民族文化部部长阿里·苏丹·伊萨等约二百位客人应邀出席了招待会。
