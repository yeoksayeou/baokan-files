In the unprecedentedly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieving decisive victory nationwide, the Shaanxi Province Revolutionary Great Alliance Consultative Conference was formally established. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a triumphant march of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

On December 26, the inaugural meeting of the Shaanxi Province Revolutionary Great Alliance Consultative Conference was held in Xi'an. Leaders from the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Committee of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including Huang Jingyao, Hu Wei, Yang Huanmin, Liu Jianong, Fang Shengpu, and Bai Xinfu, attended the meeting. When Huang Jingyao announced the formal establishment of the Shaanxi Province Revolutionary Great Alliance Consultative Conference, the entire audience erupted in prolonged, enthusiastic applause. People excitedly shouted for a long time, "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Currently, the situation in Shaanxi Province, like that in the rest of the country, is unprecedentedly favorable and continues to improve. Revolutionary masses and organizations in the Xi'an area have been studying Chairman Mao's great instructions during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China. With "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism" as the key, and with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, they have engaged in thorough discussions and consultations. Recently, they have established revolutionary great alliance consultative representative conferences for workers, peasants, higher education institutions, secondary schools, and provincial and municipal government agencies in the Xi'an area. The strong wind of revolutionary great alliance has blown across the Qinling Mountains, both north and south, the banks of the Wei River, and the 800-mile plain of Shaanxi. The Shaanxi Province Revolutionary Great Alliance Consultative Conference was established under this favorable situation.

Yang Huanmin, on behalf of the Shaanxi Provincial Military Support Committee, the Shaanxi Military Region, and all the officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Shaanxi, extended the warmest congratulations on the establishment of the Shaanxi Province Revolutionary Great Alliance Consultative Conference. He said, "The establishment of the Shaanxi Province Revolutionary Great Alliance Consultative Conference marks another significant step forward in the revolutionary great alliance in Shaanxi Province and the Xi'an area. This is a great victory in implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It is also a major achievement in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism by the revolutionary masses of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an, and a great joy for the more than 20 million people of the province. I hope that the revolutionary masses of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and strictly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. With 'Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism' as the key, continue to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthen proletarian party spirit. We must also be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage and remove all obstacles on the road to victory, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Representatives from the revolutionary great alliance consultative conferences of workers, peasants, higher education institutions, secondary schools, and provincial and municipal government agencies in the Xi'an area spoke one after another at the meeting. They expressed their determination to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They will better fight selfishness and revisionism, overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, continue to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, and strengthen proletarian party spirit. They will make new contributions to the development and consolidation of the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in Shaanxi Province and the Xi'an area.

Amidst enthusiastic applause and cheers, the meeting passed a telegram of good news to the great leader Chairman Mao. The meeting also unanimously adopted the tasks and requirements of the Shaanxi Province Revolutionary Great Alliance Consultative Conference.

    目前，陕西省和全国的无产阶级文化大革命一样，形势空前大好，而且越来越好。西安地区的各革命群众组织和革命群众，认真学习毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区所作的伟大指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在人民解放军的大力帮助下，经过充分的酝酿协商，最近分别成立了西安地区的工人、农民、高等院校、中等学校和省、市级机关的革命大联合协商代表会议。革命大联合的强劲东风，吹遍了秦岭南北、渭河两岸和八百里秦川。陕西省革命大联合协商会议就是在这种大好形势的推动下成立的。

    西安地区的工人、农民、高等院校、中等学校和省、市级机关等各方面革命大联合协商会议的代表，纷纷在会上发言。他们表示，要永远忠于毛主席，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，更好地斗私批修，破私立公，继续克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，为发展和巩固陕西省和西安地区的革命大联合、革命三结合作出新的贡献。
    在热烈的掌声和欢呼声中，会议通过了给伟大领袖毛主席的报喜电。会议还一致通过了陕西省革命大联合协商会议的任务和要求。
