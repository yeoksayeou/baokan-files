The American aggressors in Vietnam have already fallen into a dead-end situation. How to find a way out in a dead end? This is a problem that American imperialism cannot solve.

Recently, while the Johnson administration has been busy plotting to expand the war in Vietnam, it has also been shamelessly playing the "peace talks" charade. In addition to its lackeys and stooges conducting frenzied activities, it has come up with a new trick. It fabricated a myth out of thin air, claiming that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam hopes to send representatives to the United Nations. The American propaganda machine first spread the rumor, and then the U.S. State Department followed up with an official statement, loudly proclaiming that the U.S. "does not object" to representatives of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam going to the United Nations. At the same time, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, and the UN Secretary-General, U Thant, have been secretly plotting to try to put the Vietnam issue on the agenda of the Security Council. It is clear that the Johnson administration is trying to use this clumsy tactic to lure the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam into its trap, so that it can use the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnam issue. What a clever plan by the aggressors!

The Soviet revisionist leadership group has, as usual, played the role of accomplice in this despicable plot of American imperialism. At the beginning of this session of the UN General Assembly, Gromyko and Goldberg sang in unison, helping American imperialism to use the United Nations to interfere in Vietnamese affairs. The Soviet revisionist group has also repeatedly peddled the "bombing halt and deception" trick, helping the American aggressors to trick the Vietnamese people into laying down their arms. This once again exposed the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist traitor group.

However, no matter what new tricks American imperialism and its accomplices play, they will all be shattered in the face of the great Vietnamese people. The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, authorized to issue a statement on December 9, gave the Johnson administration a resounding slap in the face in front of the people of the world.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have repeatedly declared that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue. The affairs of Vietnam must be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves, and the Vietnamese people will absolutely not allow the tool of American imperialism, the United Nations, to interfere in Vietnam! This time, the Johnson administration actually fabricated the absurd rumor that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam hopes to send representatives to the United Nations to carry out its plot to use the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnam issue, which can only make it lose face.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out during the Chinese people's liberation war: "Military suppression and political deception are the two main tools that Chiang Kai-shek used to maintain his reactionary rule. Now people have seen the rapid collapse of these tools."

American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is nothing more than relying on military suppression and political deception as its two main tools. At present, the American aggressors have suffered a complete defeat on the battlefield in Vietnam, and their military suppression has long been declared bankrupt. American imperialism's "peace talks" conspiracy has also been repeatedly thwarted. This time, the Johnson administration's clumsy performance clearly shows that its political deception has also reached the point of exhaustion. The complete failure of American imperialism in the Vietnam War is already inevitable. The great anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory!

    美国侵略者在越南已经陷入了走投无路的绝境。怎样在死胡同里寻找一条出路呢？这是美帝国主义无法解决的难题。
    最近，约翰逊政府在加紧策划扩大侵越战争的同时，又大肆玩弄“和谈”骗局。它除了通过它的帮凶和奴才进行紧张活动之外，还异想天开，施展出一个新花招。它凭空?造了一个神话，说什么越南南方民族解放阵线希望派代表去联合国。美国宣传机器首先放出谣言，美国国务院接着就煞有介事地发表声明，叫嚷美国“不反对”越南南方民族解放阵线代表到联合国去。同时，美国驻联合国代表戈德堡和联合国秘书长吴丹加紧密谋策划，竭力企图把越南问题列入安理会的议程。事情很明白，约翰逊政府妄想用这种拙劣的手法，把越南南方民族解放阵线套进它的圈套，以便于利用联合国干预越南问题。好一个侵略者的如意算盘啊！
    苏修领导集团在美帝国主义的这一卑劣的阴谋中，照例充当了帮凶的角色。在这届联大开会之初，葛罗米柯就同戈德堡一唱一和，为美帝国主义利用联合国干预越南事务帮腔。苏修集团还一再兜售“停炸诱和”骗局，帮助美国侵略者诱迫越南人民放下武器。这又一次暴露了苏修叛徒集团阴险的嘴脸。
    但是，不论美帝国主义及其帮凶玩弄什么样的新花招，都要在伟大的越南人民面前碰得粉碎。越南南方解放通讯社十二月九日受权发表的严正辟谣声明，在全世界人民面前，给了约翰逊政府一记响亮的耳光。
    越南民主共和国政府和越南南方民族解放阵线一再严正宣告，联合国根本无权插手越南问题。越南的事务必须由越南人民自己解决，越南人民绝对不能容许美帝国主义的工具联合国干涉越南！约翰逊政府这一次竟然制造越南南方民族解放阵线希望派代表去联合国这种荒唐透顶的谣言，来推行它利用联合国干预越南问题的阴谋，只能使它自己大丢其丑。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在中国人民解放战争时期曾经指出：“军事镇压和政治欺骗，是蒋介石维持自己反动统治的两个主要工具，现在人们已经看到这些工具的迅速破产。”
    美帝国主义对越南的侵略，也无非是依靠军事镇压和政治欺骗这两个主要工具。目前，美国侵略者在越南战场上一败涂地，军事镇压的一手早已宣告破产。美帝国主义玩弄“和谈”阴谋也连连碰壁。这一次约翰逊政府的拙劣表演正好表明，它的政治欺骗的一手也已黔驴技穷。美帝国主义在侵越战争中的彻底失败已经是确定无疑的了。越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争必将取得最后的胜利！
