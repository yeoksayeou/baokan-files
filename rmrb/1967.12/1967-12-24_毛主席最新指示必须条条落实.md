In an inspiring and encouraging situation, the important editorial "Vigorously Conduct Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes" from the *People's Daily* conveyed our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao instructs us: "The two sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each side should engage in more self-criticism, seeking great unity and accommodating minor differences." This is not only a powerful ideological weapon for achieving and consolidating revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, but it also clearly points out the direction for the ideological revolution of the people. We must seriously implement and fully carry out these instructions, word for word, and combine learning with practice to see immediate results.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the distinctive marks that distinguish us from other parties." The method of self-criticism is the best weapon for revolutionary cadres to overcome bad work styles and maintain good work styles, and it is the best weapon for achieving the ideological revolution of the people. Only by fully utilizing this weapon can we overcome the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies in our minds, uproot the foundation of the bourgeois "self," and be infinitely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Over the past year, in the great storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have undergone a severe test of class struggle and resolutely executed and defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, some comrades, due to the influence of old habits and the failure to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies in their minds, often cannot tolerate opposing views; when others express different opinions, they become restless; when facing their opponents, they often see more of their own advantages and fewer of the other side's strengths, criticize others more, and are less strict with themselves. In a word, they lack the spirit of self-criticism and feel that self-criticism is not a glorious thing. The root of this thought is that the "self" is at work.

Having shortcomings and mistakes, can we conduct self-criticism and seriously correct them? This is one of the indicators to test whether each proletarian revolutionary is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and has a thorough revolutionary spirit. Having shortcomings and mistakes, not conducting serious self-criticism, allowing them to spread and develop, not only harms the individual but also harms the revolutionary cause. A true proletarian revolutionary is one who is "rich in the spirit of self-criticism and brave in correcting the shortcomings and mistakes in his work." At all times, in all things, and in all places, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to strictly demand of ourselves, regarding every small shortcoming and mistake as a loss to the revolutionary cause. Only in this way can we bravely conduct self-criticism, humbly accept the criticism of others, and at the same time, help comrades with the greatest enthusiasm.

To carry out serious self-criticism, we must fight against the "self" in our minds. Having shortcomings and mistakes, and still trying to cover them up, is the malignant expansion of the "self." Over time, we will unknowingly be captured by bourgeois ideology. How dangerous this is! We must not relax our self-criticism. We must take "fighting the self and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, using Mao Zedong Thought as a political mirror and microscope to examine the depths of our souls, uproot the "self" hidden in the depths of our souls, expose the "self" to the light of day, criticize and expose the "self," and let the "public" take root. Only in this way can we sweep away the obstacles of individualism, sectarianism, and factionalism on the road ahead, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and advance bravely along the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao!

    毛主席最新指示必须条条落实
    铁道兵直属机关无产阶级革命派
    在令人欢欣鼓舞的大好形势下，《人民日报》《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》的重要社论，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。毛主席指示我们：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”这不仅是实现和巩固革命大联合、革命三结合的强大思想武器，而且也为实现人的思想革命化指出了明确的方向。我们一定认真执行，条条落实，句句照办，学用结合，立竿见影。
    毛主席教导我们：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”自我批评的方法，是无产阶级革命派克服不良作风，保持优良作风的最好的武器，是实现人的思想革命化的最好武器。只有充分运用这个武器，才能克服我们头脑中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，才能挖掉资产阶级“私”字的根基，才能无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    一年多来，在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，我们经历了一场阶级斗争的严峻考验，坚决执行和捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。但是，有的同志由于旧的习惯势力的影响和头脑中资产阶级、小资产阶级思想没有根除，遇事往往听不得相反的意见；别人发表了不同意见，就坐不住；碰到自己的对立面，往往是看自己优点多，看对方的长处少，教训别人多，严于责己少。一句话，就是缺乏自我批评精神，感到自我批评是不光采的事。这种思想根子就是“私”字在作怪。
    有了缺点、错误，能不能进行自我批评，认真地改正，这是检验每一个无产阶级革命派是否无限忠于毛主席、有无彻底革命精神的标志之一。有了缺点、错误，不做认真的自我批评，任其泛滥、发展，不仅有害于个人，而且有害于革命事业。一个真正的无产阶级革命派，就是“富于自我批评精神，勇于改正自己工作中的缺点和错误。”时时、事事、处处用毛泽东思想来严格要求自己，把每一个微小的缺点、错误，都看作是对于革命事业的一分损失。只有这样，才能够勇敢地进行自我批评，虚心听取别人的批评，同时，也才能以最大的热情帮助同志。
    实行认真的自我批评，就要斗自己头脑中的“私”字。有了缺点、错误，还要文过饰非，这就是“私”字的恶性膨胀。久而久之，我们就会在不知不觉中被资产阶级思想所俘虏。这是多么危险的情景啊！我们切切不可放松自我批评。我们一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，用毛泽东思想这个政治上的照妖镜和显微镜洞察灵魂深处，挖出隐藏在灵魂深处的“私”字，把“私”字暴露在光天化日之下，把“私”字批臭，让“公”字安家落户。这样才能扫清前进道路上的个人主义、小团体主义、宗派主义等障碍，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇前进！
