Already realizing the great alliance of the revolution, the revolutionary workers of the Tonghua Rubber Factory have proven through their struggle that the process of consolidating and developing the great alliance of the revolution is the process of using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely fight against the "self" and establish the public. The key to consolidating and developing the great alliance of the revolution lies in the revolutionization of the thought of the leadership core of the revolutionary mass organizations.

The Tonghua Rubber Factory originally had two revolutionary mass organizations. They followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and realized the great alliance of the revolution through the great criticism of the revolution. In late September, they established a unified revolutionary mass organization for the entire factory—the Revolutionary Alliance Committee of the Proletarian Revolutionaries.

After the establishment of the Alliance Committee, the heads of the two formerly opposing factions sat in the same office. However, due to the fact that petty-bourgeois factionalism had not been completely eliminated, they each had their own calculations in their hearts. Some thought: The rubber factory is the first unit in the city to realize the great alliance of the revolution. Will it be consolidated or not? We can't wholeheartedly unite; we need to listen to the winds. Others thought: The alliance is an alliance, but it must be "independent and autonomous." If the alliance collapses, there will be a way out. The heads of the two factions both made second-hand preparations, known as: not cutting off the line to the top (city headquarters) and not dispersing the people below (subordinate organizations). They stretched out one arm forward to shake hands and unite, while stretching out the other arm backward to reorganize their own troops, hiding dark factions within the great alliance, making the great alliance of the entire factory face the danger of splitting.

Facing this serious situation, what should be done? Among countless methods, studying Chairman Mao's works and using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" and establish the public is the first step. With the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, the members of the Alliance Committee sat down to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Chairman Mao's teachings were like a thunderclap, awakening the committee members. They sat together and fiercely exposed their selfishness, engaging in self-criticism. They said: Keeping the dark factions is the work of petty-bourgeois factionalism. Chairman Mao calls on us to implement the great alliance of the revolution, but we insist on reorganizing our troops and going back to the old path. Isn't this deviating from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line? Everyone expressed their determination: We must fight against the "self" and establish the public, uprooting the dark factions. From then on, the committee members went deep into the grassroots organizations and among the masses to work on consolidating the great alliance of the revolution. They required their subordinate units not to say anything that is not beneficial to the great alliance of the revolution and not to do anything that is not beneficial to the great alliance of the revolution. The members of the Alliance Committee deeply felt that petty-bourgeois factionalism centered on the "self" is the enemy of the great alliance of the revolution. Before the alliance, it is an obstacle to the implementation of the great alliance of the revolution; after the alliance, it comes to sabotage. To consolidate the great alliance of the revolution from the ideological aspect, one must fiercely fight against the "self" and eliminate this factionalism, uprooting the dark factions.

After the dark factions were eliminated, the great alliance of the revolution in this factory was further consolidated. However, among the members of the Alliance Committee, issues such as competing for positions, rankings, quotas, power, and becoming the core had not been resolved. Thus, a storm of re-electing the members of the Alliance Committee arose over a certain issue. Some wanted to achieve "me as the core" through elections, while others wanted to eliminate others through elections. The great alliance of the revolution in the rubber factory was once again hit.

Competing for positions, becoming the core, etc., is another manifestation of the "self," with the "I" at the forefront. Facing this situation, the comrades from the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory sat down again with the committee members to study Chairman Mao's works and further fight against the "self" and establish the public. Chairman Mao said: "Those who cause such independence often cannot separate themselves from their personal first-ism. They may say they respect the party, but in reality, they put themselves first and the party second.... What do such people cause? They cause fame, position, and making a name for themselves." The committee members examined their thoughts and suddenly realized. They said, originally, the dark factions were cut down, but the root was not uprooted, and the "self" continued to act. They thought more about personal fame, personal interests, personal power, and personal positions, and less about Chairman Mao's teachings, the revolution, the masses, and work. This time, the election caused another major exposure of the "self." The masses were not dissatisfied with the Alliance Committee but were dissatisfied with our competing for power for personal gain; it was not that the Alliance Committee had no authority, but that we did not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions; to change the situation of weak leadership, it was not a matter of re-election or not, but a matter of firmly holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The members of the Alliance Committee sat together for criticism and self-criticism, further fiercely fighting against the "self," criticizing and overthrowing personal first-ism, and determining to further consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution. After the study, the Alliance Committee immediately decided to take "fighting against the self and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle and to hold large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes. This decision was warmly supported by the workers of the entire factory. In the process of fighting against the self and criticizing revisionism, all the workers of the factory closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. On the basis of the great alliance of the two organizations, they further rapidly realized the great alliance of the revolution by workshops and teams. Through this, the members of the Alliance Committee deeply felt that: Only when the leaders firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly overthrow the "self," can the leadership organization of the great alliance become a true representative of the revolutionary will of the masses and lead the masses forward along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The original two revolutionary mass organizations of the rubber factory belonged to the two cross-industry headquarters of the entire city. After the rubber factory realized the great alliance of the revolution and established a unified Revolutionary Alliance Committee, they, starting from what is beneficial to the great alliance of the revolution in the entire city, did not participate in the meetings and activities held by the two headquarters that were not beneficial to the great alliance of the revolution. This again caused some criticism inside and outside the factory. Some people posted big-character posters at the factory gate and on the streets, accusing them of "splitting" and "destroying the stage of the headquarters," etc. The great alliance of the revolution in the rubber factory was hit for the third time.

What should be done? Is this right or wrong? The members of the Alliance Committee brought this question to Chairman Mao's works for consultation and conducted in-depth discussions. Chairman Mao taught: "The organizational form of the revolution should serve the needs of the revolutionary struggle. If the organizational form no longer meets the needs of the struggle, then this organizational form should be abolished." After discussion, they realized: Currently, consolidating and developing the great alliance of the revolution is the urgent task and the direction of the revolutionary struggle. Not participating in some separate activities of the two factions that are not beneficial to the great alliance of the revolution is the need to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and is correct. This is neither splitting nor destroying the stage of the headquarters, but rather promoting them to implement the great alliance of the revolution and advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The members of the Alliance Committee solved their ideological problems and actively propagated this to the entire factory, gaining the unanimous support of the revolutionary masses of the entire factory.

The revolutionary workers of the Tonghua Rubber Factory have gained rich experience from the struggle to consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution in their factory. They said: The great alliance of the revolution has been realized, but it does not mean it has been consolidated. There are many contradictions to be resolved, and the most important is to resolve the contradiction between the public and the private; there are many things to do, and the most important first thing is to study Chairman Mao's works; there is much political and ideological work to be done, and the key is to focus on the revolutionization of the leadership core; there are many comrades to be united, and the most important is for the leadership core to unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought principles. The "self" is the enemy of the great alliance, and the "public" is the foundation of the great alliance. Following Chairman Mao's great instructions to fight against the self and criticize revisionism, to fiercely fight against the self and establish the public, is the fundamental way to consolidate and develop the great alliance of the revolution. Only by fiercely fighting against the "self" can the great alliance of the revolution be built on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, unshakable by strong winds and unmovable by fierce waves.

    如何巩固和发展革命大联合？通化橡胶厂的经验是：
    听毛主席的话铲除小资产阶级派性斗私批修大抓领导核心思想革命化
    据新华社长春二日电　已经实现了革命大联合的通化市橡胶厂的革命职工，用自己的斗争实践证明：巩固和发展革命大联合的过程，就是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠斗“私”字，破私立公的过程；巩固和发展革命大联合，关键又在于革命群众组织领导核心的思想革命化。
    通化市橡胶厂原有两个革命群众组织。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命大批判中实现了革命大联合，九月下旬成立了全厂统一的革命群众组织——无产阶级革命派大联合委员会。
    大联合委员会成立以后，过去对立的两大派头头坐进了一个办公室。但是由于小资产阶级派性没有全部消除，他们内心各自打着小算盘。有的想：橡胶厂是全市实现革命大联合最早的单位，是不是能巩固还不保准，不能实心实意的联，得听听风声。有的想：联合是联合，但必须“独立自主”，万一联合垮了，也有个退脚之处。两派头头都作了第二手准备，叫做：对上（市总部）不断线，对下（所属组织）不散人。他们一方面向前伸一只胳膊握手搞联合，一方面向后伸一只胳膊整顿自己的队伍，在大联合里隐藏下了暗山头，使全厂革命大联合面临着破裂的危险。
    面对着这个严重情况，怎么办？千条万条，学习毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想破私立公，是第一条。在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，大联合委员会的委员们便坐下来学习毛主席的教导：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的教导象一声春雷，震醒了委员们。大家坐在一起狠狠地亮私斗私，作自我批评。他们说：保留发展暗山头，是小资产阶级派性作怪。毛主席号召我们实行革命大联合，我们偏偏要整顿人马重上山头，走回头路，这不是背离毛主席的革命路线吗？大家纷纷表示决心：一定破私立公，挖掉暗山头。从此，委员们纷纷深入基层组织，深入群众，做巩固革命大联合的工作，各自要求下属各战团，不利于革命大联合的话不说，不利于革命大联合的事不做。大联合委员会的成员们深有体会地说，以“私”字为核心的小资产阶级派性，是革命大联合的敌人。在联合前，它是实行革命大联合的障碍；在联合后，它又来拆台。从思想上巩固革命大联合，就要狠斗“私”字，铲除这个派性，挖掉暗山头。
    暗山头铲除以后，这个厂的革命大联合得到了进一步的巩固。但是，在大联合委员会的委员中，有的人争地位、争名次、争名额、争权力、争当核心的问题，并没有解决。于是，便借着一个问题，闹起了一阵改选大联合委员会委员的风波。有的想通过选举实现“以我为核心”，有的想通过选举把别人挤掉。橡胶厂的革命大联合又一次遭到冲击。
    争地位、争当核心等等，是“私”字的又一表现，是“我”字当头。针对这种情况，驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，再一次和委员们坐下来，共同学习毛主席著作，进一步破私立公。毛主席说：“闹这类独立性的人，常常跟他们的个人第一主义分不开，他们在个人和党的关系问题上，往往是不正确的。他们在口头上虽然也说尊重党，但他们在实际上却把个人放在第一位，把党放在第二位。……这种人闹什么东西呢？闹名誉，闹地位，闹出风头。”委员们联系自己的思想作检查，恍然觉悟。他们说，原来，暗山头砍掉了，根子没有拔掉，“私”字继续作怪。想个人的名、个人的利、个人的权、个人的地位多了；想毛主席的教导、想革命、想群众、想工作少了。这一次闹改选，又是一次“私”字的大暴露。群众不满意的不是大联合委员会，而是不满意我们为个人争权；不是大联合委员会没权威，而是我们没按照毛主席的指示去做；要改变领导无力的状况，不是改选不改选的问题，而是必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的问题。大联合委员会成员坐在一起进行了批评和自我批评，进一步狠斗了“私”字，批倒了个人第一主义，决心进一步巩固和发展革命大联合。学习过后，大联合委员会立即决定以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班。这一决定发出后，受到全厂工人群众的热烈拥护。在斗私批修的过程中，全厂工人紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在两大组织实现大联合的基础上，又进一步迅速实现了按车间、班组的革命大联合。通过这件事，大联合委员会的成员们深深体会到：只有头头高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底斗倒“私”字，大联合的领导机构，才能成为真正代表群众革命意志的领导机构，才能沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，带领群众前进。
    橡胶厂原有的两个革命群众组织，原属于全市的两个跨行业的总部，在橡胶厂实现革命大联合，并建立了统一的革命大联合委员会之后，他们从有利于全市革命大联合出发，不参加两个总部单方召开的不利于革命大联合的会议和活动。于是又引起厂内厂外的一些非议。有的人把大字报贴到厂门口、大街上，指责他们是“搞分裂”、“拆总部的台”，等等。橡胶厂的革命大联合又受到第三次冲击。
    怎么办？这样做对不对？大联合委员会的成员们带着这个问题向毛主席著作请教，并进行了深入的讨论。毛主席教导说：“革命的组织形式应该服从于革命斗争的需要。如果组织形式已经与斗争的需要不相适合时，则应取消这个组织形式。”经过讨论，他们认识到：目前巩固和发展革命大联合是当务之急，是革命斗争的大方向。不参加两大派的一些不利于革命大联合的单独活动，是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的需要，是对的。这既不是搞分裂，也不是拆总部的台，而是促使他们实行革命大联合，沿着毛主席的革命路线前进。大联合委员会委员们的思想问题解决了，他们就积极向全厂宣传，取得全厂革命群众的一致支持。
    通化市橡胶厂的革命职工从巩固和发展本厂革命大联合的斗争实践中，取得了丰富的经验。他们说：革命的大联合实现了，不等于巩固了，有很多矛盾要解决，最最重要的是解决公与私的矛盾；有千头万绪的事情要做，最最重要的头等大事是学习毛主席著作；有很多政治思想工作要抓，最关键的是抓领导核心的革命化；有很多同志要搞好团结，最要紧的是领导核心要在毛泽东思想的原则基础上团结起来。“私”字是大联合的敌人，“公”字是大联合的基础，遵循毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大指示，狠狠地斗私批修，破私立公，是巩固和发展革命大联合的根本。只有狠狠地斗掉了“私”字，才能把革命的大联合建筑在毛主席的革命路线上，狂风吹不倒，恶浪打不动。
