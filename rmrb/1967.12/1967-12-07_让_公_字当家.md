Let the Character "Public" Take the Lead

Soldiers Zheng Fuqi and Liu Xingzhen

The Chinese Khrushchev has always used reactionary and decadent bourgeois selfishness to corrupt people's souls. He says: "People, in order to care about their economic lives, must certainly be concerned with wages, housing, food, and transportation. This shows the high level of democratic enthusiasm in socialist society, which is a result of socialist enthusiasm." This is nonsense! Are we fighting the revolution and building socialism for our own living conditions? This is the greatest slander against our revolutionaries. This is clearly advocating for the bourgeois philosophy of struggling for money.

Serving the people wholeheartedly is the essence of our proletariat. The great communist warrior Lei Feng, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "completely selfless and dedicated to others," although his income was not high, he still sent the money he saved to the people in disaster-stricken areas; Chairman Mao's good student Jiao Yulu, who dedicated his life to the people and worked tirelessly until his death, never thought about his own wages and housing; the heroes of the 32111 drilling team and the 1124 construction site, if they were concerned about "wages, housing, food, and transportation," could they disregard personal safety to rescue comrades and national property? We fight the revolution and participate in socialist construction precisely to be selfless, not to seek personal gain, and to serve the people wholeheartedly. What we care about most is studying Chairman Mao's works, defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Comrades have said it well: "After studying Chairman Mao's works, we have direction, we see clearly, and we do not waver." Only the likes of the Chinese Khrushchev regard money and material benefits as their lifeline.

With Mao Zedong Thought, there is socialist enthusiasm. The people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, achieve ideological revolutionization, and establish a communist worldview of wholeheartedly serving the public and the revolution, will create the situation praised by Chairman Mao: "spirits soaring, fighting spirit high, and full of vigor." Miracles will appear, look: our atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs have taken to the skies, ten-thousand-ton ships have set sail, Daqing oil flows endlessly, and Dazhai's barren mountains have turned into fertile fields.

If we follow what the Chinese Khrushchev says, pursuing life enjoyment is "socialist enthusiasm," and we all focus on "wages, housing, food, and transportation," pursue living conditions, and struggle for money, what kind of "socialist enthusiasm" is this? It is clearly capitalist enthusiasm! If we continue this way, socialism will peacefully evolve into capitalism. The first socialist country in the world, the Soviet Union, because the Khrushchev clique seized power, crazily promoted the revisionist line, has it not already realized the restoration of capitalism?

The Chinese Khrushchev advocates decadent bourgeois selfishness, precisely wanting to use material life as a channel to wash away our communist ideology of serving the public wholeheartedly, making people short-sighted, narrow-minded, apolitical, and only caring about personal interests, becoming bourgeois successors. The young generation armed with Mao Zedong Thought will not be fooled by him. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," and carry out a great revolution in the depths of our souls, thoroughly smash the "self" character, and let the communist worldview of serving the public wholeheartedly forever take the lead in our minds.

    让“公”字当家
    战士　郑富其　刘兴镇
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯用反动腐朽的资产阶级利己主义腐蚀人们的灵魂。说什么：“人民为了关心自己的经济生活，就一定要过问工资、住房、吃饭、坐车这些事，这就表现出社会主义社会人民民主的积极性高了，这是由于社会主义积极性而来的。”这是混账话！难道我们干革命建设社会主义是为了自己的生活待遇吗？这是对我们革命者最大的污蔑。这明明是鼓吹为钱而奋斗的资产阶级庸人哲学。
    全心全意为人民服务是我们无产阶级的本色。伟大的共产主义战士雷锋，他遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，“毫不利己专门利人”，他的收入虽然不多，但还是把自己节省下来的钱送给灾区人民；毛主席的好学生焦裕禄，为人民鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已，他一生从来没有想到自己的工资、住房；32111钻井队、1124工地的英雄们，如果为了“工资、住房、吃饭、坐车”，能够不顾个人安危，抢救同志和国家财产吗？我们干革命，参加社会主义建设，就是要不计报酬，不谋私利，一心一意为人民服务。我们最关心的是学习毛主席著作，捍卫毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。同志们说得好：“学了毛主席著作，就有方向，就心明眼亮，就不转向。”只有中国赫鲁晓夫之流，才把金钱、物质待遇等看作是自己的命根子。
    有了毛泽东思想，就有社会主义的积极性。人民群众用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，实现思想革命化，树立一心为公，一心为革命的共产主义世界观，就会出现毛主席赞扬的“精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发”的局面，就会出现人间奇迹，请看：我们的原子弹、氢弹上了天，万吨巨轮下了海，大庆石油滚滚流，大寨荒山变良田。
    如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫所说的那样，追求生活享受是“社会主义的积极性”，我们都去关心“工资、住房、吃饭、坐车”，去追求生活待遇，去为钱而奋斗，这是什么“社会主义积极性”，分明是资本主义积极性！这样下去，社会主义就会和平演变为资本主义。世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联由于赫鲁晓夫集团篡夺了领导权，疯狂推行修正主义路线，现在不是已经实现资本主义复辟了吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬腐朽的资产阶级利己主义，就是妄想通过物质生活这条渠道，把我们一心为公的共产主义思想冲掉，使人们都变成目光短浅，心胸狭窄，不问政治，只顾个人利益的庸人，成为资产阶级接班人。用毛泽东思想武装起来的年青一代决不会上他的当。我们一定要响应毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，在灵魂深处来一场大革命，大破“私”字，让一心为公的共产主义世界观永远在我们头脑里当家。
