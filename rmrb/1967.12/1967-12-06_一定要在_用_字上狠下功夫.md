Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao wrote an inscription for the active learners of Mao Zedong Thought at the Navy Conference of the People's Liberation Army, after which the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily published the important editorial "Study Mao Zedong Thought by Combining Learning with Application, Seeing Immediate Results." This editorial expressed what was in our hearts and further inspired the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights.

In studying this important editorial, revolutionary teachers and students recalled that every victory and every achievement gained during the Cultural Revolution was due to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

At the critical moment of the proletarian cultural revolution in middle schools, it was the brilliant "March 7" directive of our great leader Chairman Mao that pointed out the direction for our school. With the help of the PLA comrades carrying out military training tasks, we achieved great unity in revolution by the end of March and established the revolutionary three-in-one provisional power organ—the Revolutionary Committee. At the same time, we launched a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Following that, under the guidance of the "May 7" directive, our school's revolutionary teachers and students launched a high tide of "resuming classes and making revolution." The students of Class 5, Grade 2 said: "Taking the teaching class as the base, achieving great unity in revolution, this is what Chairman Mao said, this path, we will definitely take!" They connected with each other, returned to their classes, and after active preparations, began resuming classes and making revolution in early May. Since then, whenever they encountered difficulties, whenever anarchist thoughts came, they studied the brilliant "March 7" directive, overcame petty-bourgeois factionalism, and insisted on the path of resuming classes and making revolution. Under their influence, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students firmly followed Chairman Mao's directives, and in practice, they recognized even more the brilliance and greatness of Chairman Mao's teachings.

Before Chairman Mao issued the latest directive to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, many revolutionary teachers and students in our school spent a lot of energy on "internal wars." After studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, everyone's minds became clear, realizing that previously, they had not concentrated their firepower on the capitalist roaders within the party, doing things that made friends hurt and enemies happy, because they had not seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, adopting a utilitarian attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought. Facts tell us that if we study Chairman Mao's works with a utilitarian attitude, taking things out of context and picking what we need, we will definitely not study them well.

Revolutionary practice has made us deeply feel that on the revolutionary path, without Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot take a single step, we will take the wrong path, and we will fail. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we will have a clear mind and direction, and we will definitely achieve victory. In the future, we are determined to follow every word and every directive of Chairman Mao, to deeply understand, link with reality, and strictly follow them. We will study and then apply, fiercely fight selfishness, and fiercely criticize revisionism, focusing our efforts on the "use" of Chairman Mao's teachings.

    一定要在“用”字上狠下功夫
    北京二十七中革命委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席为人民解放军海军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会题词以后，《人民日报》和《解放军报》发表了《学习毛泽东思想要学用结合，立竿见影》极其重要的社论。这篇社论说出了我们的心里话，更加激励了全校革命师生把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮。
    革命师生在学习这篇重要社论中，回忆起在文化大革命中所取得的每一个胜利、每一点成绩，无不是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    在中学无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，是伟大领袖毛主席光辉的“三·七”指示给我校指明了前进的方向。在执行军训任务的解放军同志的帮助下，我们在三月底实现了革命大联合，成立了革命的三结合临时权力机构——革命委员会。同时，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。接着，在“五·七”指示的指导下，我校革命师生掀起了“复课闹革命”的高潮。初二（五）班的同学说：“以教学班为基础，实现革命大联合，这是毛主席说的，这条路，我们走定了！”他们互相串连，杀回班级，经过积极筹备，于五月上旬开始复课闹革命。从那以后，他们每当遇到困难，每当无政府主义思潮袭来，就学习光辉的“三·七”指示，克服小资产阶级派性，坚持走复课闹革命的道路。在他们的带动下，全校革命师生坚决照毛主席的指示做了，在实践中更加认识到毛主席的教导英明伟大。
    毛主席发出要斗私，批修的最新指示以前，我校许多革命师生把不少精力用在打“内战”上。学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，大家的头脑清醒了，认识到以前没有把火力集中地对准党内走资派，做了亲者痛、仇者快的事，是因为没能认真地活学活用毛主席著作，对毛泽东思想采取了实用主义的态度。事实告诉我们，学习毛主席著作，如果采取实用主义的态度，断章取义，各取所需，是一定学不好的。
    革命实践使我们深深体会到：在革命的大路上，离开毛泽东思想就寸步难行，就走弯路，就失败。照毛主席的教导去办，就心明眼亮有方向，就一定会取得胜利。今后我们决心对毛主席的每句话，每个指示，都要努力紧跟，深刻领会，联系实际，句句照办。学了就用，狠斗私，猛批修，把功夫下在“用”字上。
