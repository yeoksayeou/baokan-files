The broad masses of revolutionary residents and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai's streets and alleys are firmly implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, taking "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, and extensively setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. This has pushed the movement of great criticism and great learning in streets and alleys to a new high.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Shanghai's streets and alleys adapt to the characteristics of having many people, a wide area, and diverse objects. They adopt various forms, including those organized by the streets, those organized by the alleys, and those organized by collective enterprises. Most of the alley study classes are based on residents' newspaper reading groups and great criticism groups, organized by the masses themselves. They closely combine great criticism with great learning. The masses praise this, saying that the study classes are not only battlefields for "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism" but also heart-to-heart talks and unity meetings among comrades. This form is really good. Members participating in the study classes include leaders of street-level mass organizations, revolutionary cadres, alley party branch secretaries, committee members of residents' committees, and active residents.

The study classes in streets and alleys implement the principle of "the masses organize, teach, learn, and solve problems themselves." The seven hundred households in Minhang Street's North Street, Pujiang, and Hengjing three residents' committees organized their own Mao Zedong Thought study classes, divided into thirty-six study groups. Each group has its own agreement, and the group leaders are elected by the masses. The family is used as the classroom, and the "Three Articles" are studied extensively and applied extensively, making the classes lively and vibrant. In the study classes, many students compare themselves with the "Three Articles," expose their own "self," and struggle against their own "self." They say: if the "self" is not struggled against, following Chairman Mao would be just empty talk. An old woman, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, expressed that she would definitely educate her son, who is a cadre, to come out early and firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many street cadres, after participating in the study classes, examined their own past erroneous thoughts and expressed that they would stand tall and be lifelong servants of the people, achieving new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The study content of the classes follows the principle of being concise and precise, with a clear focus, closely linked to the current struggle, and solving one or two problems per session.

In the study classes, some students share their personal experiences, denouncing the crimes of the old society and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie; some review past sufferings and check for thoughts of forgetting one's roots, fiercely struggling against their own selfish thoughts; others extensively discuss and praise the good situation, establishing revolutionary aspirations.

Through organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, Shanghai's streets and alleys have greatly promoted the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line among the broad revolutionary residents and street and alley cadres.

　　群众自己教，自己学，自觉斗私批修
　　上海街道里弄大办毛泽东思想学习班
    本报讯　上海市街道里弄的广大革命居民、革命干部，坚决执行毛主席的指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，广泛地开办毛泽东思想学习班，把街道里弄的大批判、大学习运动推向一个新的高潮。
    上海街道里弄的毛泽东思想学习班，适应街道里弄人多、面广、对象不同等特点，采取了多种多样的形式。有街道办的，里弄办的，也有集体事业单位办的。里弄学习班，大多是在居民读报小组、大批判小组的基础上，群众自己动手办的。他们把大批判、大学习紧密结合起来。群众称赞说，学习班既是“斗私，批修”的战场，又是同志之间的谈心会、团结会，这种形式真好。参加学习班的成员，有街道一级群众组织负责人、革命干部、里弄党支部书记、居民委员会委员和居民积极分子等。
    街道里弄的学习班实行了“群众自己办，自己教，自己学，自己解决问题”的方针。闵行街道北街、浦江、横泾三个居民委员会的七百户居民，自己动手办的毛泽东思想学习班，共分三十六个学习小组，组组有公约，组长由群众自己选，家庭当课堂，大学大用“老三篇”，搞得生动活泼，热气腾腾。在学习班上，许多学员都对照“老三篇”，自己亮“私”，自己斗“私”。他们说：“私”字不斗掉，紧跟毛主席就是一句空话。一位老妈妈学习了毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示后表示：一定要教育当干部的儿子早点亮相，坚决站到毛主席的革命路线上来。不少街道干部参加了学习班之后，都检查了自己原来的一些错误思想，表示要挺直腰杆子，当一辈子人民的勤务员，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
    学习班的学习内容实行少而精的原则，中心突出，紧密结合当前斗争实际，每期解决一、两个问题。
    在学习班上，有的学员现身说法，控诉旧社会的罪恶和资产阶级反动路线的罪行；有的通过忆苦思甜，检查忘本思想，狠斗自己的私心杂念；也有的大讲、大议大好形势，树立革命的雄心壮志。
    上海街道里弄通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，在广大革命居民和街道里弄干部中大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威。
