In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan, the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan has established immortal merits. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they have done painstaking, in-depth, and detailed ideological and political work among revolutionary mass organizations. With boundless enthusiasm, they have assisted the proletarian revolutionary factions in resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. This has powerfully promoted the development of the great alliance and the three-in-one combination in the revolution in Wuhan.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan is excellent. Especially at the grassroots level, the work of the great alliance has been done solidly and effectively. Under the strong support and enthusiastic assistance of the PLA, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses have been fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, striving to catch up with each other, uniting as one, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. A situation of mutual promotion, step-by-step advancement, and overall progress in the great alliance has initially formed and is developing rapidly. Most grassroots units in the city have achieved the great alliance by workshops, teams, departments, and classes. Primary, middle, and high schools have generally started classes and carried out the revolution. The preparatory committees for the workers' congresses and the revolutionary committees in the city have also been established one after another. The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in the city are currently in a Mao Zedong Thought study class, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions together, fighting against selfishness, conducting self-criticism, and actively discussing the great alliance in the city. Their experience is: the specific problems in the great alliance were previously unthinkable, unspeakable, and unworkable; now, sitting on the same bench, thinking about Chairman Mao's teachings, looking at the demands of the revolutionary masses, learning from the actions of the PLA, and reflecting on the sins of factionalism, fighting against selfishness, once fought, it becomes clear. The power of Mao Zedong Thought is greater than anything else, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the best. For every revolutionary, being absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the greatest public cause and the highest revolutionary principle. They have turned their deep feelings of "three loyalties" into closely following Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They say: closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and acting according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions is victory.

The broad officers and soldiers of the Wuhan Military District have done painstaking, in-depth, and detailed ideological mobilization in the process of assisting the proletarian revolutionary factions in achieving the great alliance. Their specific practices are: insisting on settling "three relationships," grasping "three starting points," and achieving "three mutual promotions": settling the relationship between the city-wide great alliance and the great alliance at the grassroots level, starting from the great alliance at the grassroots level, promoting from the bottom up, combining the top and bottom, and promoting each other; settling the relationship between organizational great alliance and ideological great alliance, starting from the ideological great alliance, leading actions with thoughts, being consistent in words and deeds, combining learning and application, and promoting each other; settling the relationship between ideological great alliance and fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, starting from breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, learning urgently, seeing immediate results, combining the solution of specific problems with the transformation of worldviews, and promoting each other.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and the most capable are the most experienced fighters." The broad officers and soldiers of the Wuhan Military District regard the great significance of assisting the broad revolutionary masses in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the greatest, and regard the immense power generated by the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses using this spiritual atomic bomb as the strongest. As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions are issued, the officers and soldiers act immediately, widely propagate, and go wherever there are masses to propagate. They organized hundreds of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, rooted in the grassroots revolutionary masses of factories, schools, and institutions throughout the city, held over 1,100 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and through lectures, seminars, individual talks, and "one helps one, one pairs red" and other activities, extensively assisted the broad revolutionary masses in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and deeply carried out ideological mobilization. The ideological awareness of the broad revolutionary masses has greatly improved, and their desire to achieve the great alliance has become more urgent. Many such incidents have occurred: the leaders of some organizations are still negotiating, and many grassroots units have already achieved the revolutionary great alliance by workshops, teams, and departments. The broad revolutionary masses say, among all the reasons, the biggest reason is to follow Chairman Mao's instructions. Those who understand should resolutely implement, and those who temporarily do not understand should also resolutely implement, and deepen their understanding in the process of implementation, in order to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

In the practice of assisting the proletarian revolutionary factions in Wuhan to achieve the great alliance, the broad officers and soldiers always put ideological and political work in the first place, do not act as "referees" in specific disputes, and completely believe that the masses can educate themselves. They deeply understand: "All work that requires the participation of the masses, if there is no self-awareness and voluntarism among the masses, will become empty and fail." The most important thing in the great alliance is to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions ideologically. The PLA stationed at Wuhan Textile Factory No. 1 assisted the leaders of the three revolutionary organizations in the factory to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, which went through more than ten study sessions, four repetitions, two external impacts, and finally achieved ideological and practical implementation, item by item and clause by clause. They regard this repetition in action and organization as a manifestation of repetition in thought, and only when the problem is truly solved in thought, the action will be reliable, and the organization will be solid. To quickly solve the obstacles and interference in thought, they enthusiastically assisted the broad revolutionary masses in carrying out the activities of "three talks and three arrangements" to specially establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and specially establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line: specially talk about the exploitation and oppression suffered by the workers and peasants in the old society, and specially arrange the happy life of the workers and peasants under Chairman Mao's leadership in the new society; specially talk about the suppression and persecution of the proletarian revolutionary factions by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, and specially arrange Chairman Mao's care and support for the proletarian revolutionary factions; specially talk about the evil conspiracy of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party to deceive the masses, create divisions, and incite the masses to fight each other, and specially arrange the great significance of Chairman Mao's call for the proletarian revolutionary factions to achieve the great alliance.

After Chairman Mao issued the great battle call of "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism," the broad officers and soldiers raised their ideological and political work to a new level. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, in the seminars, and in individual talks, they took the lead in exposing their selfishness, took the lead in fighting against selfishness, inspired and assisted the broad revolutionary masses in exposing the evil of selfishness, the harm of factionalism, and formed a self-aware revolutionary upsurge of hating selfishness and loving the public, fighting against selfishness and praising the public, breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness.

The practice of the great alliance in Wuhan shows: starting from extensive mass work, starting from ideological work, starting from breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, it seems that the process is slower, but because the mobilization is extensive, the strength is powerful, and the foundation is solid, it is step by step, and the water flows into the ditch. From the perspective of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, it actually accelerates the process. In fact, these grassroots units such as factories, enterprises, and schools that have achieved the great alliance are relatively quick to establish or are preparing to establish the revolutionary committees and revolutionary preparatory groups of the three-in-one combination, not only further consolidating and developing the great alliance, but also laying a solid foundation for the great alliance and the three-in-one combination in the whole city, and powerfully promoting the great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of the unit, and powerfully promoting the implementation of the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

In the Beijing Instrument Factory, the PLA comrades executing the left-supporting task remember Chairman Mao's great teachings. After entering the factory, they actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the sharp and complex class struggle, resolutely and powerfully support the leftists, and quickly achieved the great alliance by departments, workshops, and teams in the factory. At the same time, they powerfully promoted their own thought revolutionization. This is them discussing their experiences in fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism together.

　　武汉部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
　　热情帮助革命派执行毛主席最新指示
　　有力地推动了武汉地区的革命大联合和革命三结合
    据新华社武汉十六日电　在武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命中建立了不朽功勋的中国人民解放军驻武汉部队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对革命群众组织，作艰苦深入细致的思想政治工作，满腔热情地帮助无产阶级革命派坚决贯彻执行毛主席的一系列最新指示，有力地推动了武汉地区革命的大联合和革命的三结合的发展。
    当前，武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好。尤其是基层单位的革命大联合，工作做得扎扎实实，很有成效。广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在解放军的大力支持和热情帮助下，斗私批修，你追我赶，万众一心，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，一个上筹下联、上带下促、上下结合、互相促进、稳步向前的革命大联合的局面已经初步形成，迅速发展。全市大多数基层单位，按车间、班组、部门和班级实现了革命大联合，大、中、小学校普遍开展了复课闹革命。全市的工代会、红代会的筹备组织亦已先后成立。全市各大革命群众组织的负责人，目前正在一个毛泽东思想学习班里，同读毛主席的最新指示，同斗私字，展开自我批评，积极协商全市革命大联合的事宜。他们的体会是：大联合中的具体问题，过去是想不通，说不通，行不通；现在坐到一条板凳上，想一想毛主席的教导，看一看革命群众的要求，学一学解放军的行动，摆一摆派性的罪过，猛斗私字，一斗就通。天大地大不如毛泽东思想的威力大，千好万好不如毛主席的无产阶级革命路线好。无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对每一个革命者来说，是最大的公，是高于一切的革命大节。他们把“三忠于”的深厚感情落实到对毛主席最新指示的“紧跟”上。他们说：紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，照毛主席的最新指示办事就是胜利。
    武汉部队广大指战员在帮助无产阶级革命派实现革命大联合的过程中，满腔热情，面向群众，面向基层，踏实、艰苦、细致地进行思想发动。他们的具体做法是，坚持摆好“三个关系”，狠抓“三个入手”，实现“三个互相促进”：摆好全市性革命大联合与基层单位革命大联合的关系，从狠抓基层单位的革命大联合入手，由下促上，上下结合，互相促进；摆好组织上实现革命大联合与思想上实现革命大联合的关系，从狠抓思想上的革命大联合入手，思想带行动，言行一致，学用结合，互相促进；摆好思想上的大联合与斗私批修的关系，从狠抓破私立公入手，急用先学，立竿见影，具体问题的解决与世界观的改造结合，互相促进。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”武汉部队广大指战员把帮助广大革命群众学习毛主席的最新指示的伟大意义看得最大最大最大，把千百万革命群众运用这一精神原子弹产生的无比巨大威力看得最强最强最强。毛主席的最新指示一传出，指战员们就闻风而动，广泛宣传，那里有群众，他们就到那里去宣传。他们组织了数百个毛泽东思想宣传队，扎根到全市各工厂、学校、机关的基层革命群众中，举办了一千一百多个毛泽东思想学习班，还通过讲用会、座谈会、个别谈心以及“一帮一，一对红”等多种活动，广泛地帮助广大革命群众学习毛主席的最新指示，深入地进行思想发动。广大革命群众的思想觉悟大大提高，对实现革命大联合的愿望越来越迫切，出现了不少这样的事：一些组织的头头还在协商，许多基层单位就按车间、按班级、按部门实现了革命的大联合。广大革命群众说，千条理，万条理，小道理不准压住大道理。对毛主席的指示，理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，在执行中再去加深理解，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    广大指战员在帮助武汉无产阶级革命派实现革命大联合的实践中，始终把思想政治工作放在第一位，不在具体纠纷中做“裁判员”，完全相信群众自己能够教育自己。他们深深懂得：“凡是需要群众参加的工作，如果没有群众的自觉和自愿，就会流于徒有形式而失败。”革命的大联合，最要紧的是从思想上落实毛主席的最新指示。武汉国棉一厂驻军帮助该厂三个革命组织的负责人落实毛主席的最新指示，先后经过十多次学习，四次反复，两次外来冲击，最后才从思想到行动做到项项落实，条条照办，实现了革命大联合。他们把这种行动上和组织上的反复，看作是思想上反复的表现，只有思想上真正解决问题，行动才是可靠的，组织才是牢固的。为了最快地解决思想上的障碍和干扰，他们满腔热情地帮助广大革命群众开展了大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席革命路线的绝对权威的三谈三摆活动：大谈旧社会工农群众所受的剥削压迫，大摆新社会在毛主席领导下工农群众的幸福生活；大谈党内一小撮走资派对无产阶级革命派的压制和迫害，大摆毛主席对无产阶级革命派的关怀和支持；大谈党内一小撮走资派蒙蔽群众，制造分裂，挑动群众斗群众的罪恶阴谋，大摆毛主席号召无产阶级革命派实现革命大联合的伟大意义。
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大战斗号令以后，广大指战员把思想政治工作又提高到一个新水平。在毛泽东思想学习班里，在座谈会上，在个别谈心中，他们带头亮私，带头斗私，启发和帮助广大革命群众大揭私字的罪恶，派性的危害，形成一个群众性的恨私爱公，斗私颂公，破私立公的自觉革命的热潮。
    武汉地区革命大联合的实践表明：从广泛的群众工作入手，从思想工作入手，从破私立公入手，看起来好象进程慢一点，但因为发动面广，力量雄厚，基础牢固，一步一个脚印，水到渠成，从紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署来看，反而加快了进程。事实上，这些实现了革命大联合的工厂、企业、学校等基层单位都比较快地成立了或正在筹备成立三结合的革命委员会、革筹小组，不仅进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合，为全市的革命大联合和革命三结合打下了牢固的基础，同时有力地促进了革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，有力地促进了“抓革命，促生产”方针的贯彻执行。（附图片）
　　在北京仪器厂执行支左任务的解放军同志，牢记毛主席的伟大教导，进厂后在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决有力地支持左派，使这个厂很快地实现了按科室、车间、班组系统的大联合，同时也有力地促进自己思想的革命化。这是他们一起交谈斗私批修的心得体会。
