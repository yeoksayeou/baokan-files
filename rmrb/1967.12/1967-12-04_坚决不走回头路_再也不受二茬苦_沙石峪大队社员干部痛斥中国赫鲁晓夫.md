According to Xinhua News Agency, Baoding: The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Shashiya Production Brigade, Yuegezhuang People's Commune, Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, used their personal experiences to denounce the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside.

Vice Chairman of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association of Shashiya Brigade, Han Shifa, said: After the liberation of the whole country, China's Khrushchev vigorously advocated the development of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style of individual farming households. He also absurdly claimed that "exploitation is salvation" and "hiring labor is legal." These are sheer counter-revolutionary lies. Whose salvation does China's Khrushchev want? Whose law does he want to uphold? In essence, he wants to save the landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie, and uphold the laws of the landlord and rich peasant exploiting classes. In short, he wants the landlords and rich peasants to ride roughshod over us poor and lower-middle peasants again, making us suffer twice.

Han Shifa angrily said: Before liberation, I worked as a laborer in a landlord's house for 21 years. My mother and younger brother still had to beg for food year after year. In the entire village of 78 households, 75 households worked for the landlords and rich peasants. People ate wild vegetables all year round, and many were starved to death. Yet, China's Khrushchev says "exploitation is salvation," dreaming of a reversal. This is a pipe dream that will never come true! We poor and lower-middle peasants will forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao in walking the socialist path.

Revolutionary cadre Yan Fusheng said: China's Khrushchev absurdly claims that "mechanization first, then collectivization," aiming to obstruct us poor and lower-middle peasants from taking the socialist path. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our Shashiya Brigade resolutely followed the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. In 1953, we established an agricultural cooperative, and in 1958, we established a people's commune. Relying on Mao Zedong Thought and the collective strength, we transformed a poor mountain valley into a land of flowers and fruits and a granary. The grain yield per mu increased from over 50 jin before liberation to over 500 jin now. This is the result of Chairman Mao leading us on the path of collectivization, a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The tremendous changes in Shashiya Brigade are a powerful refutation of China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "mechanization first, then collectivization."

Militia Company Commander Li Fengyuan said: During the three years of temporary economic difficulties in our country, China's Khrushchev fiercely opposed Chairman Mao and socialism, vigorously advocating "three autonomies and one contract" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods. Our brigade, influenced by the black wind of "three autonomies and one contract," also saw a brief surge in individual farming. However, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Shashiya, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely fought against this black wind of individual farming, repelled the individual farming trend, and consolidated and developed the collective economy of the people's commune. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line achieved brilliant victories, and China's Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism suffered a shameful defeat.

Active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Chen Yuzhen, said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." China's Khrushchev fiercely opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Mao Zedong Thought on the agricultural front. We must stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, forever following Chairman Mao in walking the socialist path. We must take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self" as the key link, fiercely combat selfish and impure thoughts, and criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist poison spread on the agricultural front. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in our Shashiya Brigade!

    坚决不走回头路　再也不受二茬苦
    沙石峪大队社员干部痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫
    据新华社保定电  河北遵化县岳各庄公社沙石峪大队的贫下中农和革命干部，用自己的亲身经历，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
    沙石峪大队贫协副主任韩士发说：全国解放后，中国赫鲁晓夫拚命地叫嚷发展“三马一犁一车”式的农户，还胡说什么“剥削是救人”、“雇工合法”。这是地地道道的反革命鬼话。中国赫鲁晓夫要“救”那家人，要“合”那家法？说穿了，就是救地主、富农、资产阶级的人，合地主、富农剥削阶级的法。一句话，让地主、富农再骑到我们贫农下中农头上，让我们再受二茬苦。
    韩士发愤怒地说：解放前，我在地主老财家里扛了二十一年活，我母亲和弟弟照样年年讨饭吃。全村七十八户，就有七十五户给地主、富农扛长活，人们一年到头吃野菜，有不少人被活活饿死……。而中国的赫鲁晓夫却说“剥削是救人”，想让他们翻天。这是白天作梦，永远办不到！我们贫下中农永远跟着伟大领袖毛主席走社会主义道路。
    革命干部阎福中说：中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“先机械化，后合作化”，就是妄图阻挠我们贫下中农走社会主义道路。我们沙石峪大队的广大贫下中农社员，坚决按照伟大领袖毛主席的指示，一九五三年办起了农业合作社，一九五八年又办起了人民公社。我们靠着毛泽东思想，靠着集体的力量，把一个穷山沟，改造成花果山、米粮川，粮食亩产量由解放前的五十多斤，提高到现在的五百多斤。这都是毛主席领导我们走集体化道路的结果，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们沙石峪大队天翻地覆的变化，是对中国赫鲁晓夫的“先机械化，后合作化”的反动谬论的有力回击。
    民兵连长李凤元说：中国赫鲁晓夫在我国三年经济暂时困难时期，疯狂地反对毛主席，反对社会主义，大肆鼓吹“三自一包”等反革命修正主义黑货。我们大队，由于受“三自一包”这股黑风的影响，也曾一度出现单干邪风。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的沙石峪广大贫下中农，坚决和这股“三自一包”的黑风展开了针锋相对的斗争，打退了单干风，使人民公社的集体经济得到了巩固和发展。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了辉煌胜利，中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋遭到可耻的失败。
    学习毛主席著作积极分子陈玉珍说：毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”中国赫鲁晓夫在农业战线上疯狂地反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对毛泽东思想。我们就越要坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，永远跟着毛主席走社会主义道路。我们要以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗私心杂念，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在农业战线上散布的修正主义流毒，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在我们沙石峪大队高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
