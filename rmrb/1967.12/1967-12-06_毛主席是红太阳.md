Two elderly Vietnamese people wrote a poem together, expressing their boundless joy and excitement, and conveying the sincere affection of the Vietnamese people for Chairman Mao.

	Chairman Mao is the red sun,
	His radiance shines in all directions.
	In spring, with you, flowers bloom,
	The crops are green, and the vegetables are fragrant.
	In summer, with you, the seedlings grow,
	The farmers' hearts are filled with endless joy.
	In autumn, with you, the harvest is bountiful,
	Golden grains fill the granaries.
	In winter, with you, the ice and snow melt,
	The farmers feel warm and cozy.
	Dear Leader Chairman Mao,
	Your kindness will never be forgotten.

    毛主席是红太阳
    两位越南老人以无限喜悦和激动的心情，合写了一首颂诗，表达了越南人民热爱毛主席的真挚情感。
    毛主席是红太阳，
    光芒万丈照四方。
    春天有你百花放，
    禾苗青青菜花香。
    夏天有你秧苗长，
    农民心里乐无疆。
    秋天有你收成好，
    金黄谷粒堆满仓。
    冬天有你冰雪化，
    农民身上暖洋洋。
    亲爱领袖毛主席，
    你的恩情永不忘。
