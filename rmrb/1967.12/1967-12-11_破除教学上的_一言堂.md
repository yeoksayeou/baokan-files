Breaking the Monopoly in Teaching

Beijing Grassland Middle School Physics Teacher Liu Zongeng

The PLA comrades who are carrying out military training in our school, following Chairman Mao's instructions of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers," proposed the initiative of "teachers and students teaching and learning from each other, and both going on stage to teach." I was both happy and apprehensive. I thought: to carry out the educational revolution, we must thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system, teaching content, and teaching methods. To accomplish this historical task, we must break the monopoly in teaching. Therefore, at that time, I really wanted to take the lead and try it out. But then I thought, having students go on stage to teach is something that has never been done before. If it doesn't go well, it would be a mistake, and that would be unbearable. Especially since I teach physics, which is highly scientific, and many problems I myself don't understand, how could students teach it?

What should I do? I couldn't find an answer at the moment, so I studied Chairman Mao's works with my questions in mind. Chairman Mao taught us: "Thorough materialists are fearless. We hope that all those who struggle with us will bravely take on responsibilities, overcome difficulties, not fear setbacks, not fear criticism and ridicule, and also not fear making criticisms and suggestions to us communists." "No matter who wants to understand something, it is impossible to solve it without coming into contact with that thing, that is, living in (practicing in) that environment." Chairman Mao's teachings gave me courage and also gave me methods. Suddenly, I was full of energy, determined to proceed according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

First, I found Yang Huilian, a student from Class 2, Grade 1, to prepare the lesson together and teach together. That time, we taught about electric current. During the preparation, I explained the entire lesson from beginning to end. Unexpectedly, she raised many questions after listening, some of which I had never touched upon in my previous lessons. This shook me greatly. I thought: Chairman Mao had long instructed us that "in schools, we must learn from students, learn from our educational objects." But I, on the contrary, went against Chairman Mao's great instruction and did not learn well from the revolutionary youngsters. In the future, I must follow Chairman Mao's instructions word for word. Thinking of this, I seriously considered her questions, adopted her reasonable suggestions, and rearranged the teaching content for the lesson on electric current. However, when it came time to teach, Yang Huilian got nervous as soon as she went on stage. She got flustered, her words didn't connect, and her experimental operations were not smooth. In the end, I still had to finish the entire lesson myself.

The first lesson was a failure, and both of us carried a heavy burden. "Should we give up halfway? Or should we learn from the failure and continue?" I repeatedly considered this question. Later, I took the initiative to find Yang Huilian and, together, we studied Chairman Mao's works, exposed our private thoughts, and struggled against them. Finally, we decided to continue the experiment. The content we prepared for the second lesson was resistance, conductors, and insulators. Before the lesson, we not only prepared together but also practiced teaching. During the lesson, Yang Huilian was more natural, could highlight the key points, and her expression was quite good. My heart was also full of joy.

Old contradictions were resolved, but new ones emerged. Some students said: "Yang Huilian's teaching is good, but it's just changing the soup without changing the ingredients. She only acted as a megaphone, using her mouth to say what the teacher wanted to say, without her own insights." I heard these words and thought: "Helping students teach takes more time than teaching myself, and the result is still a bunch of criticisms, truly laboring in vain." As soon as this thought surfaced, I grabbed onto it and wouldn't let go. Chairman Mao taught us to work wholeheartedly for the people's interests, but I, upon hearing some different opinions, wanted to retreat, still talking about being thorough! To understand the students' opinions, I specially convened a teaching democracy meeting and invited everyone to evaluate teaching and learning. The revolutionary teachers and students who participated in the meeting, after discussion, unanimously agreed that teachers and students teaching together achieved mutual teaching and learning, and this direction is correct; the drawback is that during preparation, teachers did some proxy work and did not well inspire students to think independently. Also, fixing one student to teach is not good, as it does not achieve the purpose of widely mobilizing students to participate in the educational revolution and also affects the teaching student's learning of other courses.

This teaching democracy meeting helped me a lot. Afterwards, whether it was preparing lessons or teaching, representatives from the relevant classes participated. During preparation, I only told everyone the plan for the next lesson and provided them with reference materials and experimental tools. The rest was for the teaching students to think about first. Finally, we held a meeting to discuss and gather ideas, confirming the teaching content. This method made up for the previous shortcomings and greatly mobilized the students' enthusiasm. Some students, in order to teach well, would discuss with other students. Students from nearby villages would even use the time they went home for meals to consult with the production team's electricians. In this way, when they went on stage to teach, they were no longer the teacher's "megaphone" and could generally express their own insights. Plus, their language was more lively and vivid, and it was very well-received.

Teachers and students combining efforts, teaching and learning from each other, is a bold attempt in the educational revolution. To complete this historical mission of the educational revolution, we still need to go through continuous struggles and arduous efforts. However, as long as we firmly follow the thoughts of Mao Zedong, resolutely fight against selfishness, dare to revolutionize, dare to practice, and continuously summarize experiences, we will surely win the final victory!

### 破除教学上的“一言堂”

　　破除教学上的“一言堂”
　　北京草场地中学物理教师　刘宗耕
    在我校执行军训任务的解放军同志，根据毛主席官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵的教导，提出“师生互教互学，共同上台讲课”的倡议。我又高兴，又害怕。心想：搞教育革命，就是要彻底摧毁资产阶级的教育制度、教学内容和教学方法，要完成这一历史任务，非破除教学上的“一言堂”不可。因此，我当时很想带头试一下。但转念一想，叫学生上台讲课，是从来没有过的事情，要是搞不好，就要犯错误，那可受不了。特别是我教的物理课，科学性很强，许多问题自己还不懂，学生怎能讲得了呢？
    怎么办？我一时找不到答案，就带着问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们说：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的，我们希望一切同我们共同奋斗的人能够勇敢地负起责任，克服困难，不要怕挫折，不要怕有人议论讥笑，也不要怕向我们共产党人提批评建议。”“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。”毛主席的教导，给了我勇气，又给了我方法。顿时，我全身是劲，决心按照毛主席的指示前进。
    首先，我找了二年级一班的杨慧莲同学，一块备课，同台讲课。那次，我们讲的是电流。在备课时，我把全节课的内容，从头至尾给她讲了一遍。没想到，她听了以后，提出了不少问题，有些问题，我过去讲课时都没接触到。这一来，对我的震动很大。心想：毛主席早就指示过我们“在学校则要向学生学习，向自己教育的对象学习”。而自己呢，却违背了毛主席的这一伟大教导，没有很好地向革命小将学习。今后，对于毛主席的指示，一定要句句照办，字字照办。想到这里，我就认真考虑她提出的问题，采纳了她的合理建议，重新安排了电流这节课的教学内容。可是讲课的时候，杨慧莲同学一上台就发慌了，她一慌，讲得下句不接上句，实验操作也不灵活。最后，还是由我一个人讲完了全课。
    第一次讲课失败，我俩都背上了思想包袱。“是半途而废？还是从失败中吸取教训，继续干下去？”我反复考虑着这个问题。后来，我主动找到杨慧莲同学，和她一起学习毛主席著作，共同亮私心，斗私心，最后决定继续试验下去。我们第二次准备讲的内容是电阻、导体和绝缘体。讲课前，不仅一起备了课，而且进行了试讲。上课时，杨慧莲同学比较自然，能突出重点，表达能力也不错。我的心里也乐滋滋的。
    旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又出现了。有些同学说：“杨慧莲讲的好是好，就是有点换汤不换药。她只是起了传声筒的作用，用她的嘴把老师要说的话说了出来，没有自己的见解。”我听了这些话，心想：“帮助同学讲课，比自己讲花费时间多，结果还招来一大堆意见，真是吃力不讨好。”这个思想一露头，我就紧紧抓住不放。毛主席教导我们要彻底地为人民的利益工作，而我只是听到了一些不同意见，就想打退堂鼓，还谈得上什么彻底！为了弄清同学们究竟有哪些意见，我专门召开了一次教学民主会，请大家一起评教评学。参加会议的革命师生经过讨论，一致认为，师生共同讲课，做到了互教互学，这个大方向是对的；缺点是，在备课时教师有些包办代替，没有很好地启发学生独立思考。同时，固定一个学生讲课也不好，它既达不到广泛发动学生参加教育革命的目的，也影响了讲课学生对其他课程的学习。
    这次教学民主会，对我的帮助很大。以后不管是备课或讲课，有关的班级都有代表轮流参加。在备课时，我只是把下堂课的计划告诉大家，并给他们准备好参考资料和实验工具，其他都由讲课的学生自己先去思考。最后，我们才开会研究，集思广益，把讲课内容确定下来。这种作法，弥补了过去的缺点，大大调动了同学的积极性。有的学生为了把课讲好，就找别的同学一块商议。家在附近农村的同学，还利用回家吃饭的时间，向生产队的电工请教。这样，他们上台讲课时，再不是老师的“传声筒”了，一般都能谈出自己的见解。加上他们的语言比较生动活泼，很受欢迎。
    教师与学生相结合，互教互学，这是教育革命中一个大胆的尝试。要完成教育革命这一历史使命，还要经过不断的斗争和艰苦的努力。但是，只要我们坚定不移地按照毛泽东思想办事，狠斗私字，大胆革命，勇于实践，不断总结经验，就一定能夺得最后的胜利！
