	“Not for Me, I Won't Do It; For Me, I Won't Do It”
	Five Good Soldiers Guo Nianfu Huang Zhenhua

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members, regardless of time and place, should never put personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." This is the standard and attitude that revolutionary soldiers should have towards the Party and the people's revolutionary cause. However, the Chinese Khrushchev blathers on about: "Personal interests must be taken care of, without personal interests there are no collective interests," "Personal interests concentrated together are the overall interests." This is indeed a self-revealing statement. In a few words, he exposes his ugly face of relying on "suffering small losses to gain big advantages" to rise to power and long-term deceit within our Party.

	The bright red "public" character is the core of the proletarian worldview; the dark "private" character is the essence of the bourgeois decaying worldview. There is public without private, there is private without true public. There is not even a hint of reconciliation between the two. The so-called "without personal interests there are no collective interests," "Personal interests concentrated together are the overall interests" by the Chinese Khrushchev, is the greatest deception to our revolutionary soldiers. It is an attempt to stick a "collectivism" shield on the stinking "individualism," using the method of "unifying the two" to cover up the struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews. His evil purpose is to make bourgeois individualism legally exist and spread freely; to corrupt us into shouting "for collective interests" with our mouths, while secretly focusing on personal business, stretching our hands far, grabbing at any advantage, and seizing any profit. He wants to push us into the mire of bourgeois individualism and make us his "tame tools" for restoring capitalism.

	Pah! Warning to you, Chinese Khrushchev, you've miscalculated. We are revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. We deeply understand that to promote communism, we must eliminate bourgeois elements; to serve the public, we must eliminate private interests. Only by completely abandoning individualism can we wholeheartedly serve the people. "Not for Me, I Won't Do It; For Me, I Won't Do It," is the bold declaration of our revolutionary soldiers. Countless heroes who dedicate their lives to the Party and the people's cause, working diligently and bravely, are the outstanding representatives of every revolutionary soldier. For the public, we are willing to struggle for life; for private interests, we won't do it for even a second.

    “为我我不干，我干不为我”
    五好战士　郭年富　黄振华
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”这就是我们革命战士对待党和人民革命事业的标准和态度。而中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么：“个人利益一定要照顾，没有个人利益就没有集体利益”，“个人利益集中起来就是整体利益”。这真是一段绝妙的自我解剖。几句话，便把他靠“吃小亏，占大便宜”起家，长期以来在我们党内招摇撞骗的丑恶面貌露了出来。
    红彤彤的“公”字是无产阶级世界观的核心；黑乎乎的“私”字则是资产阶级腐朽世界观的本质。有公则无私，有私则不是真正的公。二者连一丝调和的余地也没有。而中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“没有个人利益就没有集体利益”，“个人利益集中起来就是整体利益”，这是对我们革命战士最大的欺骗，是妄想在臭得见不得人的“个人主义”身上贴上一道“集体主义”的护身符，用公中有私，私中有公的“合二而一”的手段，掩盖无产阶级和资产阶级两种根本对立的世界观的斗争。他的罪恶目的就是，让资产阶级的个人主义合法存在，自由泛滥；把我们腐蚀成口里大喊为“集体利益”，心里专心致志搞个人经营，手伸得老长，见便宜就抢，见利就抓的个人主义的“皮笊篱”，把我们推入资产阶级个人主义的泥坑，充当他复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”。
    呸！警告你中国的赫鲁晓夫，你是错打了算盘。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，心最红，眼最亮，深深懂得，兴无必须灭资，为公必须铲私，只有彻底丢掉了个人主义才能全心全意为人民。“为我我不干，我干不为我”，是我们革命战士的豪言壮语。无数一心为公，一切为公，为了党和人民的事业兢兢业业，英勇献身的英雄，就是我们每一个革命战士的杰出代表。为公，我们甘心奋斗终生；为私，我们不干半秒钟。
