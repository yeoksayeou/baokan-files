The Ministry of National Defense held a report meeting today to warmly celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army. The powerful People's Liberation Army of China will forever be the staunchest comrade-in-arms of the Vietnam People's Army.

New China News Agency, December 21st: The Ministry of National Defense of our country held a report meeting today to warmly celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army.

Vice Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, Wang Yucheng, Deputy Director of the General Logistics Department, Zhang Xianyao, and leaders from various military branches and the Beijing Garrison, as well as over a thousand officers and soldiers from the army, navy, and air force, attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Lu Yang, Director of the Office of the Ministry of National Defense.

Ambassador Wu Mingluan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, Military Attaché Chen Wenpeng, Deputy Military Attaché He Huide, and Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, Nguyen Van Quang, were invited to attend the meeting.

Lu Yang made a speech at the meeting. He extended the warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese people and soldiers who are fighting on the front lines against American imperialism.

Lu Yang pointed out that the heroic Vietnamese people, under the wise leadership of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, have united north and south, fought against the enemy with one heart, and creatively demonstrated the immense power of people's war in the great war of resistance against American aggression. They have achieved one victory after another, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people of the world, and greatly undermining the prestige of American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries. They have set a brilliant example for the struggle of oppressed peoples and nations around the world to achieve liberation.

In his speech, Lu Yang expressed that the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam are close comrades and brothers who share weal and woe. As our great leader Chairman Mao said, "Your struggle is our struggle. The seven hundred million Chinese people are the firm backing of the Vietnamese people." We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely support our Vietnamese comrades-in-arms, and fight until we completely and thoroughly eliminate the American aggressors.

Military Attaché Chen Wenpeng was invited to give a report amid enthusiastic applause. In his report, he detailed the glorious journey of the heroic Vietnam People's Army, which has grown stronger under the wise leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party led by Chairman Ho Chi Minh, in its struggle against imperialist aggressors over the past 23 years. He introduced the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese military and people in the war of resistance against American aggression.

He said that the Vietnamese military and people are high-spirited, determined to defeat the American aggressors, and are fighting bravely. A broad and long-term people's war is developing in a magnificent and ever-expanding manner. The people in the north are fighting more bravely, and their will to fight to the end is more resolute. The people in South Vietnam have highly developed people's war, putting more than a million American and puppet troops and mercenaries in a state of complete passivity and desperation.

Chen Wenpeng emphasized that the Vietnamese nation is a resilient nation. Bombs cannot intimidate the Vietnamese people, and no cunning words can deceive the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese military and people are ready at any time to smash any new plots by the American aggressors to expand the war. He said that the 17 million people in the north will definitely stand shoulder to shoulder with the 14 million people in the south, fearing no sacrifice, and fight resolutely to achieve the complete victory of the cause of liberating the south, defending the north, and ultimately reunifying the country.

Chen Wenpeng said that Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on August 29, 1963, and his telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho on December 19 this year, are the most brilliant manifestations of the fighting unity between China and Vietnam. They are the most concentrated expressions of the iron will of the seven hundred million Chinese brothers to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the war of resistance against American aggression to complete victory. The powerful socialist China, which is vigorously carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is the most reliable vast rear area for the Vietnamese people. The powerful People's Liberation Army of China will forever be the staunchest comrade-in-arms of the Vietnam People's Army. The fighting friendship between the peoples and armies of Vietnam and China is unbreakable.

Chen Wenpeng's report was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience.

After the meeting, a film reflecting the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression was shown. (Accompanying photo)

    我国防部举行报告会热烈庆祝越南人民军建军节
    强大的中国人民解放军永远是越南人民军最坚强战友
    新华社二十一日讯　我国国防部今天举行报告会，热烈庆祝越南人民军建军二十三周年。
    中国人民解放军副总参谋长温玉成、总后勤部副部长张贤约、以及各军种和北京部队负责人，陆海空三军指战员一千多人出席了报告会。报告会由国防部办公厅主任路扬主持。
    越南民主共和国驻中国大使吴明鸾，大使馆武官陈文彭、副武官何辉德，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团长阮文广，应邀出席了报告会。
    路扬在报告会上首先致词。他向战斗在反对美帝国主义斗争最前线的兄弟的越南人民和越南人民军战友，表示最热烈的祝贺。
    路扬指出，英雄的越南人民，在越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的英明领导下，南北一心，同仇敌忾，在伟大的抗美救国战争中，创造性地发挥了人民战争的无比威力，取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利，大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风，为世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    路扬在致词中表示，中越两国人民和两国军队，是休戚与共的亲密战友和兄弟。正如我们伟大统帅毛主席所说的：“你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾”。我们一定永远遵循毛主席的教导，坚决支持兄弟的越南军民，直到把美国侵略者完全彻底消灭干净。
    陈文彭武官应邀在热烈的掌声中作报告。他在报告中详细地介绍了英雄的越南人民军，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的英明领导下，二十三年来在同帝国主义侵略者斗争中成长壮大的光辉历程，介绍了越南军民在抗美救国战争中取得的伟大胜利。
    他说，越南军民正高举决心打败美国侵略者的旗帜，进行英勇的斗争。一场广泛的长期的人民战争正在波澜壮阔地日益发展。北方军民越打越勇，决战决胜的意志更加坚定。越南南方军民高度发展了人民战争，使一百多万美伪军和仆从军，处于全面被动、走投无路的困境。
    陈文彭强调指出，越南民族是一个坚强不屈的民族，炸弹吓不倒越南人民，任何狡猾的言词也欺骗不了越南人民，越南军民随时准备粉碎美国侵略者任何新的扩大战争的阴谋。他说，一千七百万北方军民一定和一千四百万南方军民不怕任何牺牲，并肩战斗，坚决把解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的事业进行到彻底胜利。
    陈文彭说，毛泽东主席在一九六三年八月二十九日的声明和今年十二月十九日给阮友寿主席的贺电，是中越两国战斗团结的最光辉的表现，是七亿兄弟的中国人民坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到彻底胜利的钢铁意志的最集中的表现。正在胜利进行轰轰烈烈无产阶级文化大革命的强大的社会主义中国，是越南人民最可靠的辽阔后方，强大的中国人民解放军永远是越南人民军最坚强的战友。越中两国人民和军队之间的战斗友谊是牢不可破的。
    陈文彭的报告，不断激起全场热烈的掌声。
    会后放映了反映越南人民英勇抗击美国侵略者的影片。（附图片）
