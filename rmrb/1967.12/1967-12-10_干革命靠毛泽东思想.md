Relying on Mao Zedong Thought to Make Revolution

Mao Zedong Thought Helps Me Grow

A young person from Vietnam, after graduating from high school, joined the Anti-American National Salvation Youth Shock Brigade. At first, he was a bit afraid of hardship and did not work very hard. Later, with the encouragement of his comrades around him, he actively studied Chairman Mao's works and learned about the deeds of Chinese heroes such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande. As a result, he made rapid progress and was even selected by everyone as an advanced worker. He enthusiastically wrote to Chinese comrades, saying: "Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun, helping me overcome non-proletarian thoughts. I loudly sing 'The East is Red,' singing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought. I will hold the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, advance bravely, fear no hardship, fear no sacrifice, serve the people wholeheartedly, and am determined to defeat the American aggressors."

He also wrote in his letter: "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon guiding people to advance bravely. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. People of the world welcome Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong is a great leader, a great teacher, and a great commander." He excitedly said: "It is Mao Zedong Thought that made me an advanced worker."

Chairman Mao's Words Are All Truth

A carpenter from Burma, after studying Chairman Mao's works, told Chinese experts: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for the people of the world to make revolution. To make revolution, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought." A crane operator also said: "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao's words are all truth. I will definitely read Chairman Mao's books and follow Chairman Mao's teachings to make revolution." An old worker from Burma said: "Only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought can the revolution in Burma be victorious. Only by following the path of the Chinese revolution can the Burmese people achieve thorough liberation."

To Make Revolution, One Must Follow Mao Zedong's Path

An African student studying in Algeria has been consistently studying Chairman Mao's works for over two years. He not only diligently reads but also takes careful notes and writes study reflections.

One night, it was already late, and all the students had gone to sleep. This African student, holding Chairman Mao's precious book "Sparks Will Kindle a Prairie Fire," eagerly came to the room of the Chinese students. As soon as he entered, he said: "Now I am even more determined that to make revolution, one must follow Mao Zedong's path and learn Mao Zedong Thought!" When talking about the struggle against colonialism and the fight for national independence, he said: "The people of my country want liberation and must have a revolutionary party guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we must wage armed struggle and people's war. In the future, I will also bring this theory to the workers and peasants and propagate it to them. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system, this is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, whether sooner or later, and will definitely be victorious.' I am even more confident, I firmly believe that my motherland will definitely be liberated and will definitely build a socialist country like China."

He also said: "I have also understood that after the victory of the armed struggle, the struggle in the ideological realm is still very intense. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is to ensure that China will never change color and to make greater contributions to the world revolution!" He pointed out: "People of the world can only follow the path of the Chinese people to truly reach communism!" Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of revolutionaries worldwide.

An Argentine revolutionary, after eagerly receiving the long-awaited great book "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and other works of Chairman Mao, was overjoyed and immediately wrote a letter to the Chinese friend who sent the books, expressing his deepest gratitude.

He enthusiastically said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of the proletarians of the world."

He praised Chairman Mao's philosophical works, saying, "They greatly enriched and developed dialectical materialism."

He pointed out that the theory of people's war is an indispensable part of Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary people are fighting with weapons according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

Mao Zedong Thought Inspires Proletarians Worldwide

A friend from West Germany, Mendel, often listens to the broadcasts of Beijing Radio. He particularly likes the broadcasts of Chairman Mao's quotations. For this, he wrote a letter with great respect to thank Beijing Radio for spreading Mao Zedong Thought to the people of the world. He said: "The profound wisdom of this great man broadcasted by Beijing Radio points out the direction of struggle for the broad masses of people around the world, provides them with weapons of struggle, and inspires proletarians around the world to strive for the great ideal of communism."

He enthusiastically said in his letter: "People around the world are eagerly watching the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat. This revolution not only promotes the progress of China but also promotes the progress of the world."

    干革命靠毛泽东思想
    毛泽东思想使我成长
    越南一位青年，在高中毕业后参加了抗美救国青年突击队。开始他有些怕艰苦，劳动不大起劲。后来，他在周围同志的鼓励下，积极学习毛主席著作，努力学习中国的雷锋、王杰、麦贤得等英雄人物的事迹，因此进步很快，还被大家评选为先进工作者。他热情地写信给中国同志说：“毛泽东思想是红太阳，帮助我克服了非无产阶级思想。我高声歌唱《东方红》，歌唱毛泽东思想。我将更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，奋勇前进，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，全心全意为人民服务，决心打败美国侵略者。”
    他在信中还写道：“毛泽东思想是领导人们勇敢前进的灯塔。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。全世界无产者十分欢迎毛泽东思想。毛泽东同志是伟大的领袖，伟大的导师，伟大的统帅。”他激动地说：“正是毛泽东思想使我成为先进工作者。”
      毛主席的话句句是真理
    有一位缅甸木工，在学习毛主席著作之后，对中国专家说：“毛泽东思想是全世界人民进行革命的指针，干革命就要靠毛泽东思想。”还有一位起重机工人说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，毛主席的话句句是真理。我一定读毛主席的书，按照毛主席的教导干革命。”一位缅甸老工人说：“只有依靠毛泽东思想，缅甸的革命才能胜利，只有走中国革命的道路，缅甸人民才能取得彻底的解放。”
      要革命就要走毛泽东的路
    一位在阿尔及利亚学习的非洲留学生，两年多来一直坚持学习毛主席著作，他不但勤恳地阅读，而且认真做笔记和写学习心得。
    一天，已经是深夜，同学们都已睡了，这位非洲留学生手里捧着毛主席的宝书《星星之火，可以燎原》，兴致冲冲地来到了中国留学生的房间。一进门，他就说：“现在我更坚定了，要革命就得走毛泽东的路，学习毛泽东思想！”他在谈到反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争时说：“我们国家的人民要解放，就必须有一个以毛泽东思想为指导的革命党，按照毛主席的教导，搞武装斗争，搞人民战争。今后我还要把这个理论带到工人、农民中间去，向他们宣传。毛主席教导我们：‘社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。’我更坚定了信心，我坚信我的祖国一定会解放，一定会建设成一个象中国一样的社会主义国家。”
    他还说：“我也懂得了，在武装斗争取得胜利以后，思想领域里的斗争仍然很激烈。毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，就是使中国永不变色，为世界革命作出更大贡献！”他指出：“世界人民只有走中国人民的路，才能真正到达共产主义！”毛泽东思想是世界革命者的指导思想
    阿根廷一位革命者喜获盼望已久的伟大宝书《毛泽东选集》和毛主席的其他著作以后，欢欣鼓舞，立即写信给寄书给他的中国朋友，表示最深切的感谢。
    他热情地说：“毛泽东思想是世界无产者的指导思想。”
    他盛赞毛主席的哲学著作，“大大地丰富和发展了辩证唯物主义”。
    他指出，人民战争思想是毛泽东思想的不可分割的一部分。革命人民正在按照毛主席的教导，拿起武器进行斗争。
      毛泽东思想鼓舞着全世界的无产者
    西德朋友门德尔经常收听中国北京电台的广播，他最喜欢听电台广播的毛主席语录。为此，他怀着崇高的敬意，特地写信感谢北京电台向世界人民传播了毛泽东思想。他说：“北京电台所传播的这位伟人的深邃的智慧，为全世界广大人民指明了斗争方向，给予了他们以斗争武器，鼓舞了全世界的无产者为实现伟大的共产主义理想而奋斗。”
    他在信中热情地说：“全世界人民满怀希望地注视着中国无产阶级文化大革命。这场革命不仅推动了中国的进步，也推动了世界的进步。”
