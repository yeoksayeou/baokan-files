According to Xinhua News Agency, our reporter comments: The Soviet revisionist leadership recently shamelessly proclaimed that they have "consistently adhered to the line of proletarian internationalism" and have "always" provided "full support" to national liberation movements, attempting to cover up their role as the chief accomplice of U.S. imperialism and their betrayal of the interests of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. However, their frantic cries only serve to expose their true nature.

Extinguishing the Fires of Anti-U.S. Struggle in Asia, Africa, and Latin America

The Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin, since taking power in October 1964, has closely colluded with U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, conducting a series of treacherous activities against the revolutionary cause of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, committing heinous crimes.

Vietnam is the focal point of the world's anti-U.S. struggle. The Soviet revisionist clique has been playing a double game of pseudo-support and actual betrayal, attempting to bring the Vietnamese issue into the "Soviet-U.S. cooperation" track, strangling the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression. Over the past three years, the Soviet revisionist clique has intensified its support for U.S. imperialism's schemes of "bombing to negotiate," "fighting to negotiate," and "fighting to force a settlement" on the Vietnamese issue. The Soviet revisionist leaders, including Kosygin, have frequently traveled abroad, serving U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" deception. In February 1965, Kosygin visited Hanoi and shamelessly declared that he would help the United States "find a way out of Vietnam." Upon returning to Moscow, the Soviet government proposed convening a new international conference on the Indochina issue without any preconditions. In February 1967, Kosygin visited Britain and secretly conspired with the U.S. political agent, British Prime Minister Wilson, on the "bombing to negotiate" trick. Especially this June, after Kosygin's visit to the United States and his talks with Johnson in Glassboro, the Soviet revisionists have been even more actively using various occasions, including the United Nations, to help the U.S. peddle its "peace talks" deception. At the same time, the Soviet revisionists have been promoting "détente" in Europe, allowing the U.S. to withdraw troops from Europe to expand the war in Vietnam, while in Asia, they have been frenziedly anti-China, attempting to sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples.

In the Middle East conflict, where the U.S. and its lackey Israel launched armed aggression against Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist clique's treacherous face of betraying the revolutionary cause of the Arab peoples and serving imperialism was fully exposed.

On the Congo (Kinshasa) issue, the Soviet revisionists, following in Khrushchev's footsteps, actively supported U.S. imperialism in using the "UN forces" dispatched by the Security Council to suppress the revolutionary struggle of the Congolese people. In December 1964, they also colluded with the U.S. to implement a so-called "ceasefire" and "national reconciliation" in Congo (Kinshasa).

After the U.S. sent troops to suppress the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle of the Dominican people in May 1965, the Soviet revisionists not only voted in favor of authorizing the UN Secretary-General to send representatives to the Dominican Republic for "investigation" in the Security Council, allowing the U.S. to interfere in the internal affairs of the Dominican Republic through the UN, but also supported the implementation of a so-called "permanent ceasefire," attempting to force the patriotic military and civilians of the Dominican Republic to surrender to the U.S. invaders.

In summary, wherever there is a struggle against U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique has spared no effort to help U.S. imperialism suppress it. How can they have the audacity to boast about their "support" for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America?

Colluding with Reactionaries of Various Countries to Serve U.S. Needs

The Soviet revisionist clique has been talking a lot about "unity" and "alliance" with the national liberation movements of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. However, the facts are just the opposite. They have been sabotaging the national liberation movements in the region, and on the other hand, out of the common need to be anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary, they have been colluding with the reactionaries of various countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, following the lead of U.S. imperialism.

In Asia, the Soviet revisionist clique, together with U.S. imperialism, has been actively promoting a counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" and forming an anti-China "encirclement." They have openly colluded with the reactionaries of Japan, India, Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, and other countries, as well as with the various large and small puppets and lackeys of U.S. imperialism in Asia.

To fully collude with the Sato government of Japan, the Soviet revisionists have shamelessly praised it as a "stabilizing force in Asia" and a "peace-loving" country, despite the fact that the Sato government has been reviving militarism, frantically expanding its military and preparing for war, and actively participating in the U.S. strategy of invading Asia.

Regarding Indonesia, the Soviet revisionist clique has shamelessly described the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime as a government with a "determination to continue the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial struggle," and has praised the fascist leaders, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian people, as "national leaders" and "revolutionary leaders."

The Soviet revisionist clique had previously claimed that "Malaysia" was a "reliable bastion of colonialism in Southeast Asia," but now it is actively conducting trade with "Malaysia" and has formally established "diplomatic relations."

Recently, the Ne Win government of Burma has launched an anti-China campaign, and the Soviet revisionists have quickly colluded with it, while vigorously covering up the treacherous, dictatorial, anti-communist, and anti-people nature of the Ne Win government, praising it as a "revolutionary" government.

In Latin America, the Soviet revisionist clique has also colluded with U.S. imperialism, openly supporting and courting the pro-U.S. dictatorial regimes of Brazil and other countries.

From these facts, it is clear with whom the Soviet revisionist leadership is "united" in the regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They are the loyal allies of U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, and the number one traitor to the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Promoting Neo-Colonialism to Serve Counter-Revolutionary Purposes

The Soviet revisionist clique has been seriously promoting their "aid" to the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa. However, a large number of facts show that the Soviet revisionists' "aid" to some Asian and African countries is not to support their anti-imperialist struggles or promote their economic development. The Soviet revisionists' so-called foreign "aid" is completely a tool for their neo-colonialism, serving their purposes of being anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary.

The Indian National Congress government is a loyal anti-China lackey that the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism have been cultivating for many years. The Soviet revisionists have been supporting the Indian reactionaries economically and militarily. Recently, the Indian reactionaries have been frenziedly anti-China, and the Soviet revisionist clique has generously agreed to provide an additional 500 million rubles in economic "aid."

The Indonesian military fascist regime has been increasingly frenzied in its anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, brutally massacring the revolutionary people within the country, and the Soviet revisionists have agreed to extend the repayment of nearly $20 billion in debt and continuously supply it with weapons.

The Soviet revisionist clique not only exploits and plunders the Arab countries through "aid" but also attempts to use this as a means to gain a voice and control, as political capital for dirty deals with the United States.

It is very clear that the Soviet revisionists' "aid" is a typical imperialist policy, which has nothing in common with their boasted "sincere and selfless" aid!

Currently, the revolutionary situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the revolutionary situation in the world, is excellent. The great thought of Mao Zedong is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. Both the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are in a predicament of internal and external difficulties. As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will certainly deliver a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world." No matter how the Soviet revisionist clique disguises itself and serves U.S. imperialism's aggressive policies, it cannot stop the flourishing development of the national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but can only accelerate its own doom.

　　勾结美帝和各国反动派　叛卖亚非拉人民革命事业
　　苏修是美帝镇压民族解放运动的头号帮凶
    据新华社讯　本社记者述评：苏联修正主义领导集团最近无耻地宣扬什么他们“始终不渝地遵循无产阶级国际主义路线”，“一贯”“全力援助”民族解放运动，企图借此掩盖他们充当美帝国主义头号帮凶，出卖亚非拉人民和世界人民利益的丑恶面目。但是，他们这些声嘶力竭的叫喊，只能是欲盖弥彰。
    千方百计扑灭亚非拉反美斗争烈火
    以勃列日涅夫和柯西金为首的苏修领导集团，自一九六四年十月上台以来，紧密勾结美帝国主义和各国反动派，对亚非拉人民的革命事业进行了一系列叛卖活动，犯下了滔天罪行。
    越南是世界人民反美斗争的焦点。苏修集团竭力玩弄假支持、真出卖的两面手法，妄图把越南问题纳入“苏美合作”的轨道，扼杀越南人民的抗美救国斗争。三年来，苏修集团变本加厉地帮助美帝在越南问题上推行“停炸诱和”、“以战迫和”、“以战压降”等阴谋。苏修集团头目柯西金等多次出国奔走，为美帝的“和谈”骗局效劳。一九六五年二月，柯西金访问河内。他无耻地宣称，要帮助美国“从越南找到一条出路”。他一回到莫斯科，苏联政府就建议召开关于印度支那问题的“没有先决条件的”新的国际会议。一九六七年二月，柯西金访问英国，同美帝的政治掮客、英国首相威尔逊密商“停炸诱和”的把戏。特别是今年六月，柯西金跑到美国同约翰逊举行葛拉斯堡罗会谈以后，苏修更加卖力地利用各种场合，甚至利用联合国，帮助美帝兜售“和谈”骗局。与此同时，苏修一方面在欧洲大搞“缓和”，使美帝可以从欧洲抽调兵力，来扩大侵越战争；另一方面在亚洲疯狂反华，妄图挑拨中越两国人民的战斗友谊。
    在美帝及其走狗以色列向阿拉伯国家发动武装侵略的中东事件中，苏修集团出卖阿拉伯各国人民的革命、为帝国主义效劳的可耻面目空前大暴露。
    在刚果（金）问题上，苏修继承赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，积极支持美帝利用安理会派遣的“联合国军”，武装镇压刚果（金）人民的革命斗争。一九六四年十二月，他们又同美帝勾搭在一起，在刚果（金）搞所谓“停火”和“实现全国和解”。
    一九六五年五月，美国出兵镇压多米尼加人民的反美爱国斗争以后，苏修在安理会上不但投票同意授权联合国秘书长派代表去多米尼加进行“调查”，让美国通过联合国干涉多米尼加内政，而且赞成实行所谓“永久性停火”，企图迫使多米尼加的爱国军民向美国侵略者屈服。
    总之，哪里有反抗美帝国主义的斗争烈火，苏修集团就不遗余力地去帮助美帝国主义进行镇压。他们还有什么脸皮高谈对亚非拉人民的“支持”呢？
    配合美帝需要同各国反动派狼狈为奸
    苏修集团大谈特谈同亚非拉民族解放运动的“联合”和“联盟”。但是，事实恰恰相反。他们一直在亚非拉地区破坏民族解放运动，另一方面出于反共、反人民、反革命的共同需要，却配合美帝，同各国反动派大套交情，打得火热。
    在亚洲，苏修集团同美帝国主义一起，大搞反革命的“神圣同盟”和拼凑反华“包围圈”。他们已经公开同日本、印度、印尼、缅甸、泰国等国反动派，以及美帝在亚洲的其他大小傀儡和仆从勾结在一起。
    为了同日本佐藤政府实行全面勾结，苏修竟然不顾佐藤政府复活军国主义，猖狂扩军备战，积极参与美帝侵略亚洲的战略的事实，肉麻地吹捧它是什么“亚洲的稳定力量”，是“爱好和平的”。
    对印尼，苏修集团把苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，无耻地说成是具有“继续反帝反殖斗争决心”的政府，把双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的法西斯头目吹捧为“民族领袖”、“革命领导人”。
    苏修集团过去曾经宣称，“马来西亚”是“殖民主义者在东南亚的一个可靠的堡垒”，但现在却同“马来西亚”大搞贸易，正式建立“外交关系”。
    缅甸奈温政府不久前掀起了反华浪潮，苏修就加紧同它勾搭，并且极力掩饰奈温政府的卖国、独裁、反共、反人民的反动本质，吹捧它是“革命的”政府。
    在拉丁美洲，苏修集团也同美帝狼狈为奸，公开支持、拉拢巴西及其他一些国家的亲美独裁政权。
    从这些事实来看，苏修领导集团在亚非拉地区究竟同谁“联合”，难道还不清楚吗？他们是美帝国主义和各国反动派的忠实盟友，是亚非拉人民的头号叛徒。
    竭力推行新殖民主义为反革命目的服务
    苏修集团煞有介事地宣扬他们对亚非地区新独立国家的“援助”。但是，大量的事实说明，苏修对亚非一些国家的“援助”，决不是要支持这些国家的反帝斗争，促进它们的经济发展。苏修的所谓对外“援助”，完全是他们推行新殖民主义的工具，是为着实现他们的反华、反共、反人民、反革命的目的服务的。
    印度国大党政府是苏修和美帝多年来大力培植的反华忠实走卒，苏修一直在经济上和军事上为印度反动派撑腰、输血。最近印度反动派疯狂反华，苏修集团就慷慨地答应再给予五亿卢布的经济“援助”。
    印尼军人法西斯政权日益猖狂地反华排华，残酷屠杀国内的革命人民，苏修就答应它延期偿还近二十亿美元的债款，并源源不断地向它供应军火。
    苏修集团不仅通过“援助”来剥削和掠夺阿拉伯国家，而且企图借此取得发言权和控制权，作为同美国进行肮脏交易的政治资本。
    十分明显，苏修的“援助”是一种典型的帝国主义政策，这和他们吹嘘的所谓“真诚、无私”有什么共同之处呢？！
    当前，亚非拉的革命形势，全世界的革命形势，一片大好。伟大的毛泽东思想在世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族中，越来越深入人心。美帝和苏修都陷入了内外交困的境地。正如伟大的领袖毛主席所指出的：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。”不管苏修集团怎样乔装打扮，为美帝的侵略政策效劳，都无法阻挡亚非拉民族民主革命运动的蓬勃发展，而只能加速他们自己的灭亡。
