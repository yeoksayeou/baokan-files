The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the Beijing Knitting Factory is a model that embodies Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and strategic deployment. The news has stirred the hearts of the people. This is another great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and it vividly represents the excellent situation nationwide.

Since our liaison team was stationed at the Dyeing Factory, we have visited the Beijing Knitting Factory several times to learn from their experiences, which have greatly inspired and educated us. The comrades supporting the leftist movement in that factory hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, implement Chairman Mao's instructions most resolutely and swiftly, and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step. We take the comrades from the Knitting Factory as our examples, repeatedly compare ourselves to them, seriously examine ourselves, identify gaps, and continuously improve our work.

In the past, our liaison team's practice of studying Chairman Mao's works daily was sometimes disrupted and not well maintained; there were also some shortcomings in organizing the entire factory's staff to study. After learning from the Knitting Factory's experiences, we are determined to further promote the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line among all the factory's staff. The comrades in our liaison team have decided to try to free ourselves from other administrative tasks, focusing our main efforts on promoting the study of Chairman Mao's works and the implementation of his latest instructions among all the factory's staff, and becoming good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. We will work together with everyone to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, ensuring that we study Chairman Mao's works with every word and sentence deeply engraved in our hearts, execute Chairman Mao's instructions without the slightest deviation, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought without a moment's pause. Like the heroes of the Fourth Platoon and the model soldier supporting the leftist movement, Li Wenzhong, we will fight for Chairman Mao in life and dedicate ourselves to Chairman Mao in death, with unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, and follow Chairman Mao every step of the way.

Actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to promote the revolutionization of one's thoughts is the fundamental way to do a good job in supporting the leftist movement. After learning from the Knitting Factory's experiences, we realized that the comrades supporting the leftist movement must first dare to struggle against selfishness and spark a revolution in the depths of their souls. After entering the factory, we have done some work and achieved some results. Usually, we hear more words of praise. Recently, we have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, fiercely struggled against arrogance, and solved the attitude problem of learning from advanced units and the worker masses. At the same time, we examined the implementation of the "People's Love Agreement," specially sought the masses' opinions, openly conducted self-criticism, and further strengthened our ties with the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must adhere to the mass line, consult the masses on all matters, and be the students of the masses." After learning from the Knitting Factory's experiences, we realized that in the past, our ideological and political work was not thorough enough. The comrades supporting the leftist movement in the Knitting Factory have done a deep and thorough job in ideological and political work, promoting the revolutionization of one's thoughts. We are determined to learn from them, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions; in our work, we will follow the mass line, consult the masses on all matters; among the broad masses of workers and their families, we will conduct in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work, help the revolutionary masses continuously raise their class consciousness, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, forever advancing along the course charted by Chairman Mao!

　　学榜样　找差距
　　北京卫戍区某部驻北京印染厂联络组
    北京针织总厂的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是体现毛主席革命路线和战略部署的典范。消息传来，人心振奋。这是毛主席革命路线的又一伟大胜利，这是全国大好形势的生动体现。
    我们联络组进驻印染厂以后，几次去北京针织总厂学习，受到了很大的鼓舞和教育。这个厂的支左同志，毛泽东思想红旗举得最高，贯彻毛主席的指示最坚决、最迅速，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。我们以针织总厂支左同志为榜样，反复对照，认真检查，大找差距，不断改进工作。
    我们联络组过去学习毛主席著作天天读的制度，有时受到冲击，坚持不够；组织全厂职工学习也存在一些缺点。学习了针织总厂的经验以后，我们决心进一步在全厂职工中大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威。我们联络组的同志决定尽量摆脱其它事务性工作，集中主要力量抓全厂职工的毛主席著作学习和毛主席最新指示的落实工作，当好毛泽东思想宣传员。我们要和大家共同活学活用毛主席著作，确实做到学习毛主席著作一字一句刻心头，执行毛主席指示一丝一毫不走样，宣传毛泽东思想一分一秒不停息。象英雄四排和支左爱民模范李文忠同志那样，生为毛主席战斗，死为毛主席献身，对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离。
    活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化，是搞好支左工作的根本。学习针织总厂的经验后，我们认识到支左人员首先要勇于斗私，在灵魂深处爆发革命。我们进厂以后，做了一些工作，取得了一点成绩，平时听到赞扬的话多。最近我们带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗了“骄”气，从思想上解决了向先进单位学习、向工人群众学习的态度问题。同时我们检查了“爱民公约”的执行情况，专门征求了群众的意见，公开进行了自我批评，进一步密切了同群众的联系。
    毛主席教导我们：“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”学习针织总厂的经验以后，我们认识到，过去做思想政治工作是不够深入细致的。针织总厂的支左同志，把思想政治工作做得很深、很透，促进了人的思想革命化。我们决心认真向他们学习，大力宣传毛泽东思想和毛主席的最新指示；在工作中走群众路线，遇事多和群众商量；在广大职工和家属中进行深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，帮助革命群众不断提高阶级觉悟，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，永远沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进！
