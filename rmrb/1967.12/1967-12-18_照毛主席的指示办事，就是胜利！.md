Following Chairman Mao's instructions leads to victory!

The People's Liberation Army propaganda team stationed at the Shanghai Shipyard has been a shining example of supporting the left. Their experiences in supporting the left can be summed up in one fundamental point: arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought.

The Shanghai Shipyard, where we are stationed, is a large factory. During the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary masses united and fought together. However, after seizing power, due to the influence of individualism, revolutionary mass organizations started fighting among themselves, and the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party was relaxed. At this time, we gathered the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations and repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people. We guided the broad masses and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations to understand who our enemies and friends are. We taught them to use the formula of "unity-criticism-unity-self-criticism-unity" to correctly handle contradictions among revolutionary mass organizations, and to achieve great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

After more than a month of study, both sides made some self-criticisms and had the desire to unite and fight against the enemy. However, their ideological foundation was not yet solid. Once, two revolutionary mass organizations had a conflict, and internal strife was imminent. We again propagated Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people, organized them to study Chairman Mao's works, eliminated their differences, and finally achieved the great unity of revolutionary mass organizations. Soon after, the revolutionary tripartite alliance was realized throughout the factory.

Now, every unit in the factory has set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, initiating a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and criticizing and reforming oneself.

In the work of supporting the left, we deeply feel that sailing the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's words are all truths, each sentence is worth ten thousand sentences, and have immense power. Following Chairman Mao's instructions leads to victory. The greatest support for the revolutionary left is to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate to the masses, arm the masses, and promote the ideological revolution of the people.

The spirit of the 8341st Unit of the People's Liberation Army in supporting the left, humbly learning from the worker masses, and being a "permanent student who never graduates" is our example to learn from.

Comrade Lin Biao instructed us, saying: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also needs to revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." This means that in the work of supporting the left, we must first constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to transform ourselves, seriously learn from the left, and make ourselves have the left's stand, viewpoint, and feelings. When we first started supporting the left, we did not fully understand the thoughts and feelings of the proletarian revolutionary cadres, and thus often saw more of the minor issues, less of the main issues, more of the phenomena, and less of the essence, and did not support them enough. Through repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's instructions, we realized that we must correctly handle our relationship with the masses, must correctly treat the masses, and must humbly learn from the masses.

Chairman Mao waves his hand, and we advance. We will unswervingly propagate Mao Zedong Thought, firmly believe in the masses, and achieve new victories in the work of supporting the left!

　　照毛主席的指示办事，就是胜利！
　　人民解放军某部驻沪东造船厂毛泽东思想宣传队
    驻北京针织总厂的人民解放军八三四一部队，是支左工作的一面红旗。他们支左工作的经验，千条万条，最最根本的一条是用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑。
    我们所驻的上海沪东造船厂，是一个大厂。厂里的无产阶级革命派在冲破资产阶级反动路线的战斗中，团结一致，共同对敌。但在夺权以后，由于“私”字作怪，革命群众组织之间打起了“内战”，一度放松了对党内一小撮走资派的斗争。这时，我们就把各革命群众组织的负责人召集在一起，反复学习“老三篇”和毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，引导广大群众和革命群众组织负责人认清“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？”学会用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，正确处理革命群众组织之间的矛盾，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，实现革命的大联合。
    经过一个多月的学习，双方都作了一些自我批评，有了联合起来共同对敌的愿望，但思想基础还不牢固。一次，两个革命群众组织又发生了矛盾，“内战”一触即发。我们又向他们宣传毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，组织他们学习毛主席著作，消除了他们之间的分歧，终于实现了各革命群众组织的大联合。不久，又实现了全厂革命的三结合。
    现在，全厂各单位都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作、斗私批修的新高潮。
    在支左工作中，我们深深体会到，大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。毛主席的话，句句是真理，一句顶一万句，具有无比强大的威力。照毛主席的指示办事，就是胜利。对革命左派的最大支援，就是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想去宣传群众，武装群众，促进人的思想革命化。
    八三四一部队在支左工作中，虚心向工人群众学习，做革命群众的“永远毕不了业的小学生”的精神，是我们学习的榜样。
    林副主席指示我们说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”这就是说，在支左工作中要首先不断地用毛泽东思想改造自己，认真地向左派学习，使自己具有左派的立场、观点和感情。我们开始支左时，对无产阶级革命派的思想感情，是不很理解的，因而对他们往往是看支流多，看主流少，看现象多，看本质少，对他们支持不够。通过反复学习毛主席的指示，我们认识到，必须摆正自己和群众的关系，必须正确对待群众，必须虚心向群众学习。
    毛主席挥手我前进。我们一定坚持不懈地宣传毛泽东思想，坚定不移地相信群众，在支左工作中立新功！
