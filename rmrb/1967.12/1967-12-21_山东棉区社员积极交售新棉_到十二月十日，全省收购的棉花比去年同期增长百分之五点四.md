Cotton farmers in Shandong actively sell new cotton. By December 10, the province's cotton procurement has increased by 5.4 percent compared to the same period last year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 20th. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, community members, and revolutionary cadres in the cotton-producing areas of Shandong Province are actively selling new cotton. The province's cotton procurement is showing a very good situation. By December 10, the province has procured 5.4 percent more cotton than the same period last year.

Since the procurement season began, the broad masses of community members and cadres in the cotton areas of Shandong have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. They have universally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have seriously studied Chairman Mao's great decision of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," overcome selfishness and established public-mindedness, correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and actively sold cotton to the state. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants said, "Chairman Mao calls for 'must grasp cotton,' we poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and we must grasp and complete the cotton procurement task." Wucheng County established more than 400 Mao Zedong Thought study groups, with more than 70,000 community members and cadres participating in the study. They sold cotton during the day and fought selfishness and criticized revisionism at night. Currently, the entire county has completed the cotton procurement plan in advance. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the Changwei Special District strengthened market management during the procurement process, resolutely fought against speculative behavior, and actively sold cotton to the state. Now, this special district has completed the cotton procurement plan in advance.

Shandong Province's cotton production is bountiful this year, with a total output increase of more than 15 percent compared to last year. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "must grasp grain, must grasp cotton, and must grasp cloth," the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres implemented Chairman Mao's instructions in action. In cotton production, they used every means to overcome drought and pests, determined to achieve a cotton bumper harvest, support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, support the world revolution, and bring glory to Chairman Mao. Many units that were previously low-yielding cotton producers have become high-yielding units this year.

During the cotton production and procurement process, many Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams from the People's Liberation Army's agricultural support troops entered the cotton areas, propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and made contributions to achieving a cotton bumper harvest and completing the state's cotton procurement plan in advance.

    山东棉区社员积极交售新棉
    到十二月十日，全省收购的棉花比去年同期增长百分之五点四
    据新华社济南二十日电　山东省各产棉区广大贫下中农、社员群众和革命干部，积极交售新棉，全省棉花收购出现一派大好形势。到十二月十日，全省已收购的棉花，比去年同期增加百分之五点四。
    进入收购季节以来，山东棉区广大社员、干部积极响应毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，普遍举办毛泽东思想学习班。他们认真学习了毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大决策，破私立公，正确处理国家、集体和个人三者关系，积极向国家交售棉花。广大贫下中农说，毛主席号召“必须把棉花抓紧”，我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，一定要抓紧完成棉花交售任务。武城县举办了四百多个毛泽东思想学习组，有七万多社员、干部参加了学习，他们白天交售棉花，晚上斗私批修，目前全县已经超额完成棉花收购计划。昌潍专区广大贫下中农和革命干部在收购过程中加强了市场管理，坚决同投机倒把行为作斗争，积极把棉花卖给国家，现在这个专区已经超额完成了棉花收购计划。
    山东省今年棉花丰收，总产量比去年增产一成半以上，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。毛主席发出“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大号召后，广大贫下中农和革命干部把毛主席的指示认真落实到行动中去，在棉花生产中千方百计地战胜干旱、虫害，决心争取棉花丰收，支援无产阶级文化大革命，支援世界革命，为毛主席争光。很多过去的棉花低产单位，今年都变成了高产单位。
    在棉花生产和收购的过程中，人民解放军支农部队的许多毛泽东思想宣传队深入棉区，宣传毛泽东思想，为夺取棉花丰收和超额完成国家棉花收购任务作出了贡献。
