Vice Premier Nguyen Duy Trinh, who is also the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recently received the Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam, Lu Wei-Chao.

During the meeting, Nguyen Duy Trinh, on behalf of the Vietnam Labor Party, the government, and the Vietnamese people, strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for violating international law by dispatching aircraft to bomb and attack the Chinese cargo ship Hongqi 154, which was docked at Hong Khe Port in Quang Ninh Province, on November 25, 1967.

Nguyen Duy Trinh, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs, asked Lu Wei-Chao, the Charge d'Affaires, to convey his warmest greetings to the captain, crew, and injured personnel of the Hongqi 154 cargo ship.

Nguyen Duy Trinh emphasized, "The repeated attacks by U.S. imperialists on Chinese and other foreign merchant ships in Vietnamese waters are a serious 'escalation' in their aggressive war against Vietnam. They blatantly violate the rights of free trade and free passage between countries at sea. The Vietnamese people will resolutely fight back, resist U.S. imperialism, and will certainly deliver a fatal blow to it."

Lu Wei-Chao, the Charge d'Affaires, strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' attack on the Chinese cargo ship Hongqi 154, pointing out: The U.S. aggressor planes bombing our cargo ship at a Vietnamese port is part of the U.S. imperialists' serious 'escalation' in their war of aggression against Vietnam. They attempt to use this to 'suppress and intimidate.' But their plot will never succeed. The new crime committed by U.S. imperialism is a serious provocation against the Chinese people. The Chinese people's stance of supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation is unshakable. No matter what happens, the Chinese people will resolutely stand and fight alongside our Vietnamese brothers, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people in carrying out their war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation to the end.

Lu Wei-Chao, the Charge d'Affaires, expressed sincere thanks to the Vietnam Labor Party, the government, the Vietnamese people, and the relevant local departments for their concern and condolences for the injured Chinese sailors.

    阮维桢副总理接见我临时代办时谴责美机轰炸中国货轮
    越南人民坚决战斗给美帝以致命打击
    新华社河内二日电  越南民主共和国政府副总理兼外交部长阮维桢，最近接见了中国驻越南大使馆临时代办陆维钊。
    接见时，阮维桢代表越南劳动党、政府和越南人民愤怒谴责美帝国主义践踏国际法准则，于一九六七年十一月二十五日派遣飞机轰炸和袭击停泊在越南广宁省鸿基港的中国货船红旗一五四号。
    阮维桢副总理兼外交部长请陆维钊临时代办向红旗一五四号货船船长、船员和伤员转致最亲切的问候。
    阮维桢强调指出：“美帝国主义在越南海域接连袭击中国和其他外国商船的事件，是美国强盗在侵略越南战争中的严重‘升级’步骤，它粗暴地侵犯了在海上各国之间的自由贸易和自由往来权利。越南人民坚决战斗，抗击美帝国主义，并必将给予它致命的打击。”
    陆维钊临时代办强烈谴责了美帝国主义袭击我国货船红旗一五四号的罪行，并且指出：美国强盗飞机轰炸在越南港口的我国货船，是美帝国主义侵略越南战争严重“升级”的一个组成部分，它妄图以此来“以炸压和”。但它的阴谋是决不会得逞的。美帝国主义犯下的这一新的罪行，是对中国人民的严重挑衅。中国人民支援越南人民抗美救国战争的严正立场是坚定不移的。不管出现什么情况，中国人民坚决和兄弟的越南人民战斗在一起，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。
    陆维钊临时代办对越南劳动党、政府和越南人民，以及当地有关部门对我国受伤船员的关怀和慰问，表示诚挚的感谢。
