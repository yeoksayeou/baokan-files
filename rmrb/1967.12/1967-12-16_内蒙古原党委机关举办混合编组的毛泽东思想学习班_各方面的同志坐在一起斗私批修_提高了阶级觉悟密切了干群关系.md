The original Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee office's "Red Flag Headquarters," based on Chairman Mao's instructions on "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and fighting selfishness," organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. The class included representatives from the People's Liberation Army, leaders and members of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres, cadres who had made mistakes, and heads of conservative organizations along with the masses. This class has significantly raised the class consciousness of cadres and the masses, united more than 95% of the masses and cadres, and promoted a spirit of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness.

Initially, some comrades had reservations about holding such a study class, fearing that sitting together would not lead to effective learning and might instead cause chaos. At this time, they studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and analyzed the current situation. Everyone realized that after more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought had been widely spread, the masses had been fully mobilized, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line had achieved decisive victories. Through repeated struggles in the class struggle, the class lines had become clear. The proletarian revolutionary faction was in a position of power and enjoyed high prestige among the broad masses and cadres. The problems of cadres who had made mistakes and masses who had once taken the wrong side were mostly internal contradictions among the people. They believed in the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought to transform their thinking and in the boundless love of the broad masses and cadres for Chairman Mao, their willingness to revolutionize, and their ability to consciously revolutionize. This was the political and ideological foundation for holding such a mixed group study class.

In the study class, they took "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and fighting selfishness" as the guiding principle, implementing the principle of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity." They educated themselves, raised their own problems, and solved them themselves, freeing themselves from the shackles of selfishness, and achieving good results. At the beginning of the study class, everyone had their own thoughts. Cadres who had made mistakes and masses who had taken the wrong side simply adopted an attitude of accepting criticism and education, seeing themselves only as objects of the revolution, not as a revolutionary force. Revolutionary faction comrades adopted an attitude of listening, speaking, and promoting, not seeing themselves as objects of the revolution, and some even did not want to expose their selfishness in front of comrades who had made mistakes, fearing loss of face. If this state of mind persisted, it would obviously not be conducive to learning or to fighting selfishness. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism, everyone realized that whether or not to conduct serious self-criticism is a touchstone of whether one is willing to be a thorough revolutionary. Thus, revolutionary faction comrades took the lead in conducting self-criticism, especially exposing their selfishness in not correctly treating comrades who had made mistakes, deeply moving everyone. Some comrades who had made mistakes said, "The proletarian revolutionary faction has defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the general direction is correct. They also fiercely fight selfishness. I have made many mistakes; shouldn't I conduct a thorough self-examination?" In this way, a self-criticism atmosphere quickly formed in the study class, and everyone actively aligned themselves with Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, put down their burdens, started their engines, and felt particularly relaxed.

Comrades from various sides studied and applied Chairman Mao's works together, fought selfishness, and criticized revisionism, allowing everyone to learn from both positive and negative experiences, promoting each other, and raising themselves together. Comrades who had made mistakes, after hearing the proletarian revolutionary faction expose and fight selfishness, were deeply moved and expressed their desire to learn from their spirit of always listening to Chairman Mao's words and loving Chairman Mao infinitely, thoroughly transforming their thinking, and keeping up with the revolutionary situation. When comrades who had made mistakes examined and analyzed the causes of their mistakes, checking that they had not listened to Chairman Mao's words and had not correctly treated the masses, the revolutionary faction comrades also gained enlightenment. Some comrades said, "Our position has changed. If we do not always listen to Chairman Mao's teachings, do not correctly treat the masses, and do not correctly treat ourselves, we will also walk the path of making mistakes."

After more than twenty days of study, the relationships between the students greatly improved, becoming harmonious. Chairman Mao said, "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." This situation has been formed in the study class.

In the Beijing Clothing Factory, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Beijing to support the left helped the proletarian revolutionary faction organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes with "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and fighting selfishness" as the guiding principle. They were both organizers and leaders and the best students, setting a good example for the revolutionary masses. The picture shows them studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions word by word in the Mao Zedong Thought study class with the revolutionary masses.

　　内蒙古原党委机关举办混合编组的毛泽东思想学习班
　　各方面的同志坐在一起斗私批修
    提高了阶级觉悟密切了干群关系
    本报讯　原内蒙古自治区党委机关“红旗总部”，根据毛主席“斗私，批修”的指示，举办了包括解放军代表、革命群众组织负责人和一般成员、革命领导干部和犯过错误的干部、参加过保守组织的头头和群众参加的毛泽东思想学习班，对提高干部和群众的阶级觉悟，团结百分之九十五以上的群众和干部，发扬团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的作风，起了显著的作用。
    开始，有的同志对办这样的学习班有顾虑，怕坐在一起学不起来，反而闹得不可开交。这时，他们学习了毛主席的最新指示，分析了当前的形势。大家认识到，经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，战无不胜的毛泽东思想已经得到了大普及，群众已经充分发动起来，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线已经取得了决定性的胜利；在阶级斗争的反复较量中，阶级阵线基本上已经分明；无产阶级革命派已处于掌权的地位，在广大群众和干部的心目中，享有很高的威信；犯错误的干部和一度站错了队的群众，他们的问题绝大部分属于人民内部矛盾，应当坚信毛泽东思想无比强大的威力能够改造他们的思想，坚信广大干部和群众无限热爱毛主席，愿意革命，能够自觉革命。这就是能够举办这种混合编组的学习班的政治思想基础。
    在学习班里，他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，实行“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的原则，自己教育自己，自己提出问题自己解决，自己从“私”字的枷锁下解放自己，收到了很好的效果。学习班开始时，各人有各人的想法。犯过错误的干部和站错队的群众，单纯抱着接受批评和教育的态度，只把自己作为革命的对象，没有把自己也作为革命的一份力量。革命派的同志，抱着去听一听、说一说、促一促的态度，没有把自己也当成革命的对象，甚至有人不愿意在犯错误同志面前亮私，怕丢了面子。如果保持这种状态，显然不利于学习，不利于斗私。大家学习了毛主席有关批评与自我批评的教导以后，认识到能不能进行认真的自我批评，是愿不愿意作一个彻底革命派的试金石。于是，革命派同志带头进行自我批评，特别是亮出不能正确对待犯错误同志的私心，深深地感动了大家。有些犯过错误的同志说：“无产阶级革命派保卫了毛主席的革命路线，大方向是正确的，还狠斗私字。自己犯了许多错误，难道还不该好好检查吗？”这样，学习班里很快形成了自我批评的风气，大家都主动向毛主席的革命路线靠拢，放下包袱，开动机器，心情特别舒畅。
    各方面的同志在一起活学活用毛主席著作，斗私，批修，使大家吸取了正面和反面的经验，互相促进，共同提高。犯过错误的同志，听了无产阶级革命派亮私斗私以后，非常感动，表示要学习他们处处听毛主席的话，无限热爱毛主席的精神，彻底改造自己的思想，跟上革命形势。当犯过错误的同志检查、分析犯错误的原因，检查到没有听毛主席的话，没有正确对待群众的时候，革命派的同志也得到了启发。有的同志说：“我们现在的地位变了，如果不时时刻刻听毛主席的教导，不正确对待群众，不正确对待自己，也将会走上犯错误的道路。”
    经过二十多天的学习，学员之间大大增进了相互了解，关系变得融洽了。毛主席说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”这种局面已在学习班里形成。（附图片）
