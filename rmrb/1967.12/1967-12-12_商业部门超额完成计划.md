The state-run commercial enterprises and consumer cooperatives in Albania have both exceeded their plans in the first ten months of this year. The consumer cooperatives in rural areas alone have increased their sales of goods by 3.4 percent above the plan.

This year, the total business volume of commercial enterprises throughout Albania has shown a significant increase compared to last year. In the first nine months of this year, compared to the same period last year, the quantity of goods sold to the people has increased by 13.6 percent for meat, 11.1 percent for fish, 18.5 percent for milk, 32 percent for fresh fruits, and 11.7 percent for cotton textiles. The sales of cement and other construction materials, as well as sewing machines, bicycles, and radios, have also greatly increased, especially in rural areas.

These achievements fully reflect the development of Albania's industrial and agricultural production and the continuous increase in the people's income.

　　商业部门超额完成计划
    今年一月至十月的头十个月中，阿尔巴尼亚国营商业企业和消费合作社都超额完成了计划，单消费合作社在农村的商品销售量就超额百分之三点四。
    今年，全阿尔巴尼亚商业企业的营业额比去年有了显著增长。以今年头九个月中向人民销售的商品数量和去年同期相比，肉类增加百分之十三点六，鱼类增加百分之十一点一，牛奶增加百分之十八点五，鲜水果增加百分之三十二，棉织品增加百分之十一点七。水泥和其他建筑物资，以及缝纫机、自行车和收音机的销售量也大大增加，特别是在农村。
    这些成就充分反映了阿尔巴尼亚工农业生产的发展和人民收入的不断增长。
