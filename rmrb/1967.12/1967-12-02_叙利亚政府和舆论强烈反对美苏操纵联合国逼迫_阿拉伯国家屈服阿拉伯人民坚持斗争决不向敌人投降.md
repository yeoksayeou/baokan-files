The Syrian National Defense Council held a massive rally and demonstration in Damascus on November 29 with over 30,000 participants. The event firmly rejected the United Nations Security Council's resolution, passed late last month under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, which pressured Arab states to fully surrender. The event also resolved to use people's war to reclaim the homeland occupied by the U.S. imperialist lackey, Israel.

Syrian head of state Ateishi spoke at the rally, denouncing U.S. imperialism's control over the United Nations. He said: We firmly reject the recent UN Security Council resolution proposed by Britain. Ateishi pointed out: We have already seen the consequences of political solutions. For us, the only way is military struggle.

The demonstrators marched through the streets of Damascus, passionately chanting: "Down with the butcher Johnson!" "People's war is the only path to liberate Palestine!" "Arab people reject the British proposal!"

The Syrian government spokesperson and several Syrian newspapers issued comments, condemning the U.S. and Soviet manipulation of the UN Security Council's resolution on the Middle East issue, which pressured Arab states to fully surrender to the aggressors.

The Syrian government spokesperson commented on November 23: Syria firmly opposes the UN Security Council's resolution proposed by Britain, as this resolution legalizes aggression and expansion on the international stage.

The spokesperson emphasized: Syria rejects any compromise with the aggressors. Syria calls on the Arab people to prepare for a long-term struggle to reclaim the Arab lands occupied by the aggressors.

The Syrian newspaper *Al-Ba'ath* commented on November 23, stating that the UN Security Council's resolution on the Middle East issue is the result of imperialist and Arab reactionary conspiracies. The newspaper said that the Security Council has become a platform for implementing new imperialist plots and new Israeli aggressions.

The Syrian newspaper *Al-Thawra* published an editorial on November 25, calling on all Arab people to take practical actions to oppose the UN Security Council's recent resolution on the Middle East issue.

    叙利亚政府和舆论强烈反对美苏操纵联合国逼迫
    阿拉伯国家屈服阿拉伯人民坚持斗争决不向敌人投降
    据新华社讯　叙利亚保卫祖国委员会十一月二十九日在大马士革举行有三万多人参加的声势浩大的群众示威游行和集会，坚决拒绝联合国安理会于上月下旬在美帝、苏修的操纵下通过的逼迫阿拉伯国家全面投降的提案，并决心用人民战争来收复被美帝走狗以色列侵占的家园。
    叙利亚国家元首阿塔西在群众集会上发表讲话，谴责美帝控制联合国的罪恶活动。他说：我们坚决拒绝联合国安理会最近通过的英国提案。阿塔西指出：我们已经看到过政治解决的后果，对我们来说，唯一的办法是军事斗争。
    示威游行群众在大马士革列队游行，情绪激昂地高呼：“打倒刽子手约翰逊！”“人民战争是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一道路！”“阿拉伯人民拒绝英国提案！”
    叙利亚政府发言人和一些叙利亚报纸纷纷发表评论，谴责美苏操纵联合国安全理事会二十二日就中东问题通过的逼迫阿拉伯国家向侵略者全面投降的英国提案。
    叙利亚政府发言人二十三日发表评论说：叙利亚坚决反对联合国安理会通过的英国提案，因为这个提案使得侵略和扩张在国际上合法化。
    这位发言人强调说：叙利亚拒绝对侵略者进行任何妥协。叙利亚呼吁阿拉伯人民准备为收复被侵略者占领的阿拉伯土地而进行长期的斗争。
    叙利亚《复兴报》二十三日指出，安理会通过的关于中东问题的提案是帝国主义和阿拉伯反动派策划阴谋的结果。这家报纸说，安理会已被作为实现帝国主义新阴谋和以色列新侵略的讲坛。
    叙利亚《革命报》二十五日发表社论，呼吁全体阿拉伯人民用实际行动来反对联合国安理会最近通过的关于中东问题的“决议”。
