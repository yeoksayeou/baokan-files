Edition: 3

The grand plan to print 80 million copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in our country was completed ahead of schedule in the triumphant songs of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

This is an unprecedented great achievement, this is the greatest news for the revolutionary people of the whole country and the whole world!

The revolutionary workers in the publishing, printing, and distribution systems enthusiastically shout: "Long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought!"

The revolutionary cadres and masses of the proletariat throughout China enthusiastically shout: "Long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought!"

The Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of the whole world enthusiastically shout: "Long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought!"

A ship on the vast ocean relies on its helmsman, and a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

In these days of global jubilation, hundreds of millions of revolutionary people strongly expressed their boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Our reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, is the most beloved great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the revolutionary people of the whole country and the whole world. He is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage—the great stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The whole world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, pointed out profoundly:

Mastering Mao Zedong Thought, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time, oppressed nations and peoples can, through their own struggles, achieve liberation.

Mastering Mao Zedong Thought, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time, countries that have already established proletarian dictatorship can, through their own struggles, prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Mastering Mao Zedong Thought, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time, the people of countries whose power has been usurped by revisionism can, through their own struggles, overthrow the rule of revisionism and re-establish proletarian dictatorship.

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, combined with the revolutionary practice of the peoples of all countries in the world, can smash the old world to smithereens.

"Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," this is the great truth of our time!

"Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao," this is the common vow of the revolutionary people of our time!

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pushed the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the people of our country to a new stage. Now, the broad revolutionary cadres and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are striving to engrave Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, dissolve it in their blood, and implement it in their actions, making it their soul, letting Mao Zedong Thought guide every second of their lives, and are determined to build our great motherland into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

The revolutionary people of various countries in the world are also striving to learn and master the great Mao Zedong Thought, using it to guide their revolutionary practice. They have repeatedly expressed to the people of our country: Mao Zedong is the great helmsman of the world revolution. The earlier you send Chairman Mao's precious books to the hands of the world's revolutionary people, the earlier the world revolution will be victorious!

The sincere feelings of the revolutionary people of the whole country and the whole world loving the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought are a great encouragement and a great spur to the revolutionary workers in our country's publishing and printing systems. For many years, they have been eagerly looking forward to printing large quantities of Chairman Mao's works to satisfy the strong desire of the revolutionary people at home and abroad to study Mao Zedong Thought.

However, before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, with Liu Shaoqi as their representative, fiercely opposed the revolutionary people studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They used every means to suppress the publication of Chairman Mao's works, attempting to block the great historical tide of hundreds of millions of laboring people directly grasping Mao Zedong Thought.

The arms of the mantis cannot stop the wheels of history, and the wings of the crow cannot cover the golden sun. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, Liu Shaoqi was overthrown, and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists entrenched in the publishing and printing industries were overthrown. The wish of the revolutionary workers to print large quantities of revolutionary treasures—Chairman Mao's works—has been realized!

For the victory of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution

"Printing one more copy of Chairman Mao's works adds one more force to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!"

To print the revolutionary treasures well, the revolutionary workers in our country's publishing and printing systems have poured in boundless revolutionary passion, spending countless days and nights in battle.

To print the revolutionary treasures well, they gave up rest and seized every second.

To print the revolutionary treasures well, they were meticulous and pursued perfection.

To print the revolutionary treasures well, no matter how great the difficulties, they remained unshakable.

On the eve of National Day, the temperature in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, had dropped below zero degrees Celsius. The Zhaoyuan County Printing Plant, which started printing Chairman Mao's works during the Cultural Revolution, worked tirelessly for a day and returned home late at night to rest.

At this moment, the north wind howled, and the cold was biting. In this cold night, long queues formed in front of the Xinhua Bookstore. Workers, peasants, revolutionary students and teachers, cadres from various departments, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army braved the biting cold, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, waiting to buy revolutionary treasures.

The workers, seeing this moving scene, returned home excited and could not sleep for a long time. At the same moment, how many people in the whole country and the whole world were eagerly waiting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures!

Thinking about it, they could no longer lie down, and one by one, they got up and returned to the factory, working again at the glorious post of printing revolutionary treasures!

In the Chinese Academy of Sciences Printing Plant, the workers regarded every character and punctuation mark printed in the revolutionary treasures as the most glorious responsibility to the revolutionary people of the whole country and the whole world.

Once, when printing a batch of 50,000 copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," just as the entire binding and packaging work was about to be completed, they found that two books with three characters printed somewhat indistinctly had been mixed in.

Should they find these two books from the 50,000 books, or should they send them to the readers as they are?

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must be in the interest of the people. If there are mistakes, they must be corrected, this is called being responsible to the people."

The workers, in light of Chairman Mao's teachings, seriously examined themselves. They said, Chairman Mao's books are the source of strength and the guarantee of victory. Every word is true gold, every sentence is the truth, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences. Every word and every character are related to the fate and future of the revolutionary people of the whole country and the whole world. We must ensure 100% quality and cannot have the slightest negligence!

The workers spoke more and more excitedly, thought more and more urgently. They used their Sunday rest time to check package by package, book by book, and finally found these two books from the 50,000 copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"!

The revolutionary workers in the publishing and printing systems of the capital and Shanghai, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Henan, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Hunan, and other provinces and cities, and the printing plants of the People's Liberation Army, made outstanding contributions to completing this year's grand plan to print Chairman Mao's works. They printed in large quantities and with high quality. Many factories also pursued perfection in the cover and binding. The revolutionary workers of the Dongfanghong Printing Plant in Tianjin, after more than 200 experiments, produced a shiny red and golden plastic cover. Recently, the revolutionary workers of Shanghai People's Printing Plant No. 17 carefully developed a new machine that can print a golden portrait of Chairman Mao and golden characters on the red "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" plastic covers. The workers of these two factories said, our wish is: let the cover of the revolutionary treasures more vividly show the brilliant light of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and more vividly show the great characteristics of the era when billions of red hearts turn to the sun!

The revolutionary workers in our country's publishing and printing systems, standing by the machines, with their hearts in the world, printing Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures, their hearts beating with the steps of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, every moment contributing to the most sublime and magnificent great cause of spreading Mao Zedong Thought!

In fact, those who contributed to printing revolutionary treasures and spreading Mao Zedong Thought are not just the revolutionary workers in the publishing and printing systems!

In Zizhong City, Sichuan Province, in August and September of this year, there was a revolutionary scene of collective efforts to print the works of the great leader Chairman Mao.

At that time, the Zizhong City Xinhua Printing Plant decided to urgently repair the equipment to ensure the quality and quantity of printing revolutionary treasures. The news spread, and the Zizhong City Machinery Plant immediately sent cadres and technical personnel to help repair the machines. The revolutionary workers of the Zizhong City Foundry worked overnight to cast the parts urgently needed by the printing plant. The revolutionary workers of the Zizhong City Salt Machinery Repair Plant took on a batch of parts repair tasks. The Zizhong City Salt Industry Company also sent the best technicians. The Zizhong Party School and the Zizhong Sports Commission voluntarily vacated rooms to help solve the problems of insufficient factory space and warehouses. Neighborhood residents, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses from other industries came in an endless stream to participate in voluntary labor.

The revolutionary masses said: "Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts. Publishing Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures is our common glorious task!"

In the printing of revolutionary treasures in various places, the moving example of Zizhong is a microcosm. The broad revolutionary cadres and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country are all contributing their strength to publish Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures and for the victory of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

The great victory of completing the grand plan to print 80 million copies of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" ahead of schedule is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Sending a large number of revolutionary treasures to the hands of millions of revolutionary people is another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought that resonates through the clouds!

Now, on the vast land of our great motherland, in factories, rural areas, departments, schools, and the stations of the People's Liberation Army, one can often see the scene of drums and firecrackers, old and young supporting each other, and joyful jumping. This is the celebration activity of the "book-giving ceremony" held by the broad revolutionary masses of our country to welcome Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures.

When the decorated car carrying revolutionary treasures arrives, the revolutionary masses spread the news and gather in groups to welcome it. In some places, they even welcome it for several miles or tens of miles. Wherever the decorated car goes, people follow. The revolutionary masses shout enthusiastically: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

When the revolutionary masses obtain the revolutionary treasures they have been eagerly waiting for day and night, the scene is even more moving. They solemnly swear one by one:

"Read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime, follow Chairman Mao to make revolution for a lifetime!"

"The sea may dry up, the stones may rot, but the red heart loyal to Mao Zedong Thought will never change!"

The book distribution personnel, to send the revolutionary treasures to the front lines of industrial and agricultural production, to the broad masses of workers and peasants, and to the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the coastal and border fronts, braved mountains and rivers and endured hardships. The revolutionary workers in the supply, postal, medical, and other industries also regarded the distribution of revolutionary treasures as their sublime political task.

The revolutionary workers in the book distribution system of Haiyang County, Shandong Province, all vowed to be propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and proposed that the distribution of revolutionary treasures should achieve "five arrivals" and "five sides": send to construction sites, fields, orchards, Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and homes of poor and lower-middle peasants; work, propagate, distribute, investigate, and organize the masses to study while working.

To send Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the revolutionary people of the whole county, the revolutionary cadres of various industries in this county, under the unified leadership of the revolutionary committee, have become voluntary book distributors. Various stores, supply points, hospitals, banks, and service industry business premises have set up "treasure book stands" in prominent places. In many schools, "treasure book stores" have been set up. Taxation, postal, and medical personnel on various fronts carry "treasure book boxes" with them during their rounds. In this way, the whole county can obtain Chairman Mao's works everywhere.

In the western border region of Xinjiang, Alatao, once, a book distributor, carrying Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures, traveled for five days and, in the midst of a thunderstorm at midnight, arrived at a high-altitude pasture of the third production brigade of the Renxing Commune.

The Kazakh herdsmen within a radius of 30-40 miles heard the news and rushed to the scene, and the grassland immediately became lively. An elderly herdsman in his seventies, after receiving the shiny red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," kissed it again and again. Looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the cover page of the revolutionary treasures, the old man said emotionally: "It is you, old man, who made my eyes bright, it is you, old man, who made us poor herdsmen see through the black hearts of Liu Shaoqi! We people of all nationalities will forever follow you to make revolution and will never leave your brilliant thoughts!"

The comrades engaged in distribution work saw with their own eyes that the broad revolutionary masses cherished Chairman Mao's works, studied and applied them actively, combined learning with practice, and achieved immediate results, turning spiritual strength into immense material strength. They were deeply educated and greatly inspired by this, further deepening their understanding of Comrade Lin Biao's profound judgment: "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force, will become a spiritual atomic bomb of tremendous power."

We celebrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought in our country! We celebrate the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world!

In the world, hundreds of millions of revolutionary people have found the direction of revolution from the brilliant works of Chairman Mao and obtained the great spiritual strength to advance towards victory.

Today, a new situation of unprecedented widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought has emerged in the world. Whether in heroic Albania or in Vietnam, which is steadfastly fighting the anti-American rescue war; whether in the high mountains and steep cliffs of South America or in the vast forests of Africa, in the six continents and 148 countries and regions of the globe, countless revolutionaries are learning and spreading the great Mao Zedong Thought, letting the light of Mao Zedong Thought shine all over the globe.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the peoples of Laos, Burma, the Philippines, Thailand, India, Indonesia, and other countries are walking on and insisting on the correct path of revolutionary armed struggle, making a big stir against the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries riding on their heads, and striving for their complete liberation.

"Only Mao Zedong Thought can save Japan," Japanese friends have realized this great truth through actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Many revolutionary people of various countries have also realized this great truth through actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries are terrified of the dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought and are frightened to death. They arbitrarily arrest, imprison, and even shoot revolutionary people who read Chairman Mao's works. However, under the bayonets of the enemy, in the gloomy prisons, more and more revolutionary fighters, risking their lives, secretly pass on Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasures book by book, page by page, drawing inexhaustible strength from them.

The revolutionary people of various countries have felt from their own experiences that the large-scale publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works by the Chinese people and the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest support for the revolutionary struggles of the world proletariat and the peoples of various countries!

In the letters and gifts they sent to express their sincere hopes and heartfelt thanks for this support, there is a red banner donated in the name of the Communist Party of Burma.

This banner was personally presented by Comrade De Zhen Ba Dian Ding, the first vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Burma, on November 7, 1967. At that time, the Burmese version of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" had just been published in our country. When De Zhen Ba Dian Ding presented the banner to the revolutionary workers of several factories in Beijing who participated in the publication work, he highly praised the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people for providing the "priceless treasure and the sharpest ideological weapon" for the Communist Party of Burma and the Burmese people. He said: "Our party and people's army will take Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, insist on the people's armed struggle, until the Burmese revolution achieves final victory."

The words of De Zhen Ba Dian Ding expressed the common feelings and common wishes of all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of various countries.

Mao Zedong Thought is victory!

Following Mao Zedong, the world will be red!

Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

    毛泽东思想胜利万岁
    ——欢呼革命宝书毛主席著作大量印行
    我国一九六七年印制八千万部《毛泽东选集》的宏伟计划，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，提前胜利完成了！
    这是空前的伟大创举，这是全国、全世界革命人民的最大喜讯！
    出版、印刷、发行系统的广大革命职工热烈欢呼：“毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”
    全中国无产阶级革命派和革命群众热烈欢呼：“毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”
    全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民热烈欢呼：“毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”	大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想
      在这举世欢腾的日子里，亿万革命人民强烈地表达了对伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的感情。
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，是全中国、全世界革命人民最敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段——伟大的毛泽东思想阶段。全世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志精辟地指出：
    掌握了毛泽东思想这个当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，被压迫民族和被压迫人民，就能够经过自己的斗争，得到解放。
    掌握了毛泽东思想这个当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，已经建立了无产阶级专政的国家，就能够经过自己的斗争，防止资本主义复辟。
    掌握了毛泽东思想这个当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，被修正主义篡夺了政权的国家的人民，就能够经过自己的斗争，推翻修正主义的统治，重建无产阶级专政。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同全世界各国人民的革命实践相结合，就可以把整个旧世界打得落花流水。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，这是我们时代的伟大真理！
    “读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，这是我们时代革命人民的共同誓愿！
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把我国人民活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动，推向了一个新阶段。现在，广大无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众，正在努力把毛泽东思想刻在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上，化为自己的灵魂，让毛泽东思想统帅自己生命的每一秒钟，决心把我们伟大祖国建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    世界各国革命人民也在努力学习和掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想指导他们的革命实践。他们一次又一次地向我国人民表示：毛泽东是世界革命的伟大舵手。你们把毛主席的宝书早一分钟送到世界革命人民手中，就使世界革命早一分钟胜利！
    全中国、全世界革命人民热爱伟大领袖毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想的真挚感情，对我国出版、印刷系统的革命职工是巨大的鼓舞，巨大的鞭策。多少年来，他们日夜盼望能够大量印制毛主席著作，满足中外革命人民学习毛泽东思想的强烈愿望。
    可是，在无产阶级文化大革命以前，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，穷凶极恶反对革命人民活学活用毛主席著作，千方百计压制毛主席著作的出版，妄图阻挡亿万劳动人民直接掌握毛泽东思想这个伟大的历史潮流。
    螳螂的臂膀挡不住历史的车轮，乌鸦的翅膀遮不住金色的太阳。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫垮台了，盘踞在出版、印刷界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子垮台了，革命职工大量印制革命宝书毛主席著作的愿望实现了！	为了中国革命和世界革命的胜利
      “多印出一本毛主席著作，就能多为中国革命和世界革命增添一份力量！”
      为了印好革命宝书，我国出版、印刷系统的广大革命职工，倾注了无比炽热的革命激情，度过了多少战斗的日日夜夜。
      为了印好革命宝书，他们放弃休息，争分夺秒。
      为了印好革命宝书，他们一丝不苟，精益求精。
      为了印好革命宝书，他们困难再大，毫不动摇。
      国庆节前夕的黑龙江省肇源县，气温已经降到摄氏零度以下。在文化大革命中开始印制毛主席著作的肇源县印刷厂，工人们为了赶印革命宝书，紧张地劳动了一天，深夜才回家休息。
    这时，北风呼啸，寒气逼人。在这寒冷的深夜，新华书店门前排着长长的队伍。工人、农民、革命师生、机关干部和解放军战士，冒着凛冽寒风，高唱毛主席语录歌，等候购买革命宝书。
    工人们看到这个动人的场面，回到家里激动得久久不能入睡。在这同一时刻，全中国、全世界有多少人盼望得到毛主席的革命宝书啊！
    想着，想着，他们再也躺不下去了，一个个起身返回工厂，又在印制革命宝书的光荣岗位上工作起来！
    在中国科学院印刷厂，工人们把印好革命宝书的一个字一个标点，都看成是对全中国、全世界革命人民承担的最光荣的责任。
    有一次，印制一批五万册《毛泽东选集》，在全部装订、打包工作即将结束的时候，他们发现把各有三个字印得比较模糊的两册书混装进去了。
    是把这两册书从五万册书里找出来，还是就这样送到读者手里？
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”
    工人们对照毛主席的教导，严肃地做了检查。他们说，毛主席的书是力量的源泉，胜利的保证，字字是真金，句句是真理，一句顶一万句，每句话、每个字都关系到全中国、全世界革命人民的命运和前途。我们必须百分之百地保证质量，决不能有一分一厘一丝一毫的疏忽！
    工人们越说越激动，越想越着急。他们利用星期天休息时间，一包一包地翻，一本一本地查，终于从五万册《毛泽东选集》中，把这两册书找了出来！
    首都和上海、山东、黑龙江、河北、河南、浙江、江苏、广东、湖南等省、市出版、印刷系统的革命职工，中国人民解放军的各印刷厂，为完成今年印制毛主席著作的宏伟计划，做出了突出的贡献。他们印量大，质量好。许多工厂对封面、装潢，也精益求精。天津市东方红印刷厂革命职工，经过二百多次试验，制成了红光闪闪、金光灿灿的塑料封面。不久前，上海人民印刷十七厂的革命职工，精心试制成功一种新机器，可以在红彤彤的《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》塑料封面上印刷金色毛主席像和金字。这两个厂的革命职工说，我们的心愿是：让革命宝书的封面更加显示出伟大的毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，更加显示出亿万颗红心向太阳的伟大时代特点！
    我国出版、印刷系统广大革命职工，站在机器旁，胸怀全世界，手印毛主席的革命宝书，心随中国革命和世界革命的步伐一起跳动，每时每刻都在为传播毛泽东思想这一最崇高、最壮丽的伟大事业贡献力量！
    其实，为印制革命宝书、传播毛泽东思想贡献力量的，又何止是出版、印刷系统的革命职工！
    在四川省自贡市，今年八、九月间，出现了群策群力印制伟大领袖毛主席著作的革命景象。
    当时，市新华印刷厂为了保质保量地印好革命宝书，决定突击检修设备。消息传开，市机械一厂立即派来了干部和技术人员，帮助检修机器。市铸造厂革命职工连夜突击，把印刷厂急需的机件铸造了出来。市制盐机修厂革命职工，抢着承担了一批机件修配任务。市盐业公司也派来了最好的技工。市党校、市体委主动腾出房子，帮助解决厂房和仓库不足的困难。街道居民、红卫兵小将和其他行业的广大革命群众，络绎不绝地来参加义务劳动。
    革命群众说：“毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。出版毛主席的革命宝书，是我们共同的光荣任务！”
    在各地印制革命宝书的工作中，自贡的动人事例是一个缩影。我国广大无产阶级革命派，亿万革命群众，都在为出版毛主席的革命宝书，为中国革命和世界革命的胜利，贡献自己的力量！	把毛泽东思想送到亿万革命人民心坎上
    提前胜利完成今年印制八千万部《毛泽东选集》的伟大计划，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    把大量的革命宝书送到千千万万革命人民手中，是又一曲响彻云霄的毛泽东思想的凯歌！
    如今，在我们伟大祖国的辽阔疆土上，在工厂、农村、机关、学校和中国人民解放军驻地，常常可以看到锣鼓喧天、鞭炮齐鸣、扶老携幼、欢呼跳跃的沸腾景象。这是我国广大革命群众为了迎接毛主席的革命宝书，在举行“授书仪式”的庆祝活动。
    当运送革命宝书的彩车到来时，革命群众奔走相告，成群结队前往迎接，有些地方甚至迎出几里、几十里。彩车走到那里，人们就跟到那里。革命群众纵情欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    当革命群众得到自己日夜盼望的革命宝书时，情景更加动人。他们一个个庄严宣誓：
      “读一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命！”
      “海可枯，石可烂，忠于毛泽东思想的红心永不变！”
    图书发行人员为了把革命宝书送到工农业生产第一线，送到广大工农群众和战斗在海防前哨、边防阵地上的人民解放军广大指战员手中，跋山涉水，不畏艰苦。供销、邮递、卫生等各行各业的革命职工，也都把发行革命宝书当作自己崇高的政治任务。
    山东省海阳县图书发行系统的革命职工，人人争当毛泽东思想宣传员，提出发行革命宝书要做到“五到”、“五边”：送到工地、送到田间、送到场园、送到毛泽东思想学习班、送到贫下中农家里；边劳动、边宣传、边发行、边调查、边组织群众学习。
    为了把毛泽东思想送到全县革命人民的心坎里，这个县各行各业的无产阶级革命派在革命委员会的统一领导下，许多人都成了义务的图书发行员。各商店、供销点、医院、银行，服务行业的营业场所，在醒目的地方设立了“宝书台”。在许多学校，设立了“宝书店”。税务、邮递、医务等战线的革命职工在巡回工作时，随身带上了“宝书箱”。这样，就使全县到处都可以得到毛主席著作。
    在祖国西北边疆的新疆阿尔泰地区，有一次，一个图书发行员，带着毛主席的革命宝书，赶了五天路程，在雷雨交加的午夜，来到了仁星公社第三生产队一处高山牧场。
    在周围三四十里放牧的哈萨克牧民闻讯赶到，草原顿时欢腾起来。一个七十多岁的老牧民在拿到红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》以后，亲了又亲，吻了又吻。老人看着革命宝书扉页上的毛主席像，深情地说道：“是您老人家使我的眼睛亮了，是您老人家使我们贫苦牧民分清了敌我，看透了中国赫鲁晓夫的黑心肠！我们各族人民永远跟着您干革命，永远也不离开您的光辉思想！”
    从事发行工作的同志们亲眼看到，广大革命群众对毛主席著作爱不释手，活学活用，学用结合，立竿见影，把精神力量变成了巨大的物质力量。他们从中受到深刻的教育，巨大的鼓舞，进一步加深了对林彪同志这一英明论断的理解：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”	让红太阳的光辉照遍全世界
    我们为毛泽东思想在我国取得的伟大胜利而欢呼！我们为毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播而欢呼！
    在全世界，亿万革命人民从毛主席的光辉著作中找到了革命的方向，得到了胜利前进的巨大精神力量。
    今天，毛泽东思想在全世界空前大普及的崭新局面已经出现。不论在英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，还是在坚持抗美救国战争的越南；不论在高山峻岭的南美洲山区，还是在地域辽阔的非洲丛林，在全球六大洲的一百四十八个国家和地区，都有无数的革命者在学习和传播伟大的毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想的光辉照遍全球。
    在毛泽东思想指引下，老挝、缅甸、菲律宾、泰国、印度、印尼等等国家的人民，正在走上和坚持革命武装斗争的正确道路，大造骑在他们头上的帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反，争取自己的彻底解放。
    “只有毛泽东思想才能救日本”，日本朋友通过活学活用毛主席著作，认识了这个伟大的真理。许多国家的革命人民通过活学活用毛主席著作，也认识了这样的伟大真理。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，对毛泽东思想的传播怕得要命，吓得要死。他们对阅读毛主席著作的革命人民，任意逮捕，监禁，甚至枪杀。但是，在敌人的刺刀下，在阴森的监狱中，越来越多的革命战士，冒着生命危险，坚持把毛主席的革命宝书一本一本秘密传递，一页一页秘密传抄，从中汲取无穷无尽的力量。
    各国革命人民从自己的切身经历中体会到，中国人民大量出版、发行毛主席著作，广泛传播毛泽东思想，就是对世界无产阶级和各国人民革命斗争的最大支援！
    在他们表示殷切盼望和衷心感谢这种支援而寄送来的大批信件和礼物中，有一面以缅甸共产党名义赠送的鲜红的锦旗。
    这面锦旗，是一九六七年十一月七日，由缅甸共产党中央第一副主席德钦巴登顶同志亲手赠送的。当时，缅文版《毛泽东选集》刚刚在我国出版，德钦巴登顶同志在向参加出版工作的北京几个工厂的革命职工赠旗时，高度赞扬中国共产党和中国人民为缅甸共产党和缅甸人民提供了“无价之宝和最锐利的思想武器”。他表示：“我们党和人民军将用毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持人民的武装斗争，直到缅甸革命最后取得胜利。”
    德钦巴登顶同志的话，表达了全世界马克思列宁主义者和各国革命人民共同的感情，共同的心愿。
    毛泽东思想就是胜利！
    跟着毛泽东，世界一片红！
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！
