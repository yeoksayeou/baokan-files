The broad revolutionary masses of Tianjin enthusiastically celebrate the birth of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

From early morning to late at night today, from the factories along the Haihe River to the new port docks on the shores of the Bohai Sea, from the streets and alleys to the suburban communes, there is singing and laughter everywhere. People rejoice in the boundless victory of Mao Zedong Thought! They rejoice in the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! The revolutionary masses shout in thousands of voices, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" They sincerely wish the great leader Chairman Mao a long life! A long, long life!

On the day the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee was established, the committee's chairman, Jie Xuegong, told a reporter, "We proletarian revolutionaries seized power relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and we will also rely on Mao Zedong Thought to grasp and consolidate power. Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength, the guarantee of victory, and the lifeline of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee has been born. We have a thousand things and ten thousand things to do, but the top priority is to vigorously promote the study of Chairman Mao's works and to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We must place the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything, and we are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

The responsible comrades of the workers', peasants', and students' representative assemblies gathered together, discussing the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Tianjin. They excitedly said, "The birth of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee is a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought resonating across the Bohai Bay, a glorious achievement of the broad revolutionary masses of Tianjin, under the support of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and engaging in an eighteen-month struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin. They said, "The birth of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee marks the beginning of a new Long March. The tasks before us are extremely arduous and glorious. We must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, never forget to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take 'criticize self and repudiate revisionism' as the key link, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We must consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, do a good job in revolutionary criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units. In all fields, we must firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high over the skies of Haihe River, and resolutely turn the gateway to the capital, Tianjin, into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought."

Today, the early shift workers of the No. 2 open-hearth furnace at the Tianjin Steel Plant presented a new achievement of producing a batch of high-quality carbon structural steel in thirty minutes less than usual to the newly born Revolutionary Committee. The revolutionary workers of this factory excitedly expressed their determination to support the newly born Revolutionary Committee with actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

In the suburbs of Tianjin, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres wrote big-character posters, put up slogans, and held celebration and discussion meetings to celebrate the establishment of the municipal Revolutionary Committee. The broad revolutionary teachers and students of primary and secondary schools in Tianjin also enthusiastically welcomed the establishment of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

The PLA troops stationed in Tianjin enthusiastically welcome the birth of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee and unanimously express their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, step by step, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly support the newly born Revolutionary Committee, and achieve new successes in defending socialist motherland and in the "three supports, two militaries" work.

In the past two days, whether inside or outside the barracks, or on the front lines of the "three supports, two militaries," the broad cadres and soldiers of the Tianjin garrison have been filled with joy. They shouted in thousands of voices, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" They sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" over and over again. They said, "The establishment of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee has thoroughly shattered the Chinese Khrushchev's dream of turning Tianjin into a black stronghold of capitalist restoration, and it has announced the complete collapse of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents' counter-revolutionary revisionist rule in Tianjin. This is a new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We celebrate this victory, consolidate this victory, and develop this victory!"

The cadres and soldiers reviewed the glorious course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They talked passionately about the great achievements since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and discussed the excellent situation in Tianjin. They said: The gains are countless, but they all come down to one point: a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's unparalleled wisdom and the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought. We will forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They expressed: In the past, we fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionaries, and in the future, we will definitely be more closely united, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people," resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further do a good job in the "three supports, two militaries" work, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and turn Tianjin into a blazing red school of Mao Zedong Thought.
