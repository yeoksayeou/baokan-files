The Syrian Umayyad Folk Art Troupe left Beijing on the afternoon of the 26th to visit and perform in various southern parts of China. As the Syrian friends boarded the train, they waved copies of the Little Red Book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

Representatives from relevant departments and over 200 representatives from the revolutionary faction of the capital's literary and artistic circles went to the station to see them off.

Syrian Ambassador to China, Sadiq, accompanied the art troupe to other parts of the country.
