Under the personal care of Vice Chairman Lin, the PLA publishes over 50 million copies of revolutionary classics

The extensive distribution of Chairman Mao's works has further deepened the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the troops. A soldier writes in verse: "Chairman Mao's works are given to me, a million rays of light shine in my heart, revolutionaries with you, are like a ship with a rudder."

Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: Under the personal care of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the broad masses of cadres and workers in the publishing, printing, and distribution departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This year, they have printed 56 million copies of Chairman Mao's works. This is a major event in the political life of the entire army. The extensive distribution of Chairman Mao's works better satisfies the urgent need of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in the army to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

The number and quality of Chairman Mao's works published by the People's Liberation Army this year are unprecedented. By December 28th, the troops had printed a total of 56,260,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works. Among them, "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (Volumes 1 to 4) have been distributed to every cadre and soldier in the army and to all departmental staff. The "Old Five Articles" have 12,500,000 copies, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" 5,000,000 copies, and "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" 1,370,000 copies. A large number of Chairman Mao's works not only meet the needs of the troops but also support the local areas, supplying revolutionary masses with them.

Since Vice Chairman Lin took charge of the work of the Military Commission in 1960, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically responded to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, launching a wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely opposed the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing in resisting and sabotaging the printing of Chairman Mao's works and crazily opposing Mao Zedong Thought. The number of Chairman Mao's works printed in the army has increased year by year, and the quality has improved year by year. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has surged forward like a mighty torrent, wave upon wave, unstoppable. "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao" has become the common vow of the cadres and soldiers in the entire army; obtaining Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics has become the greatest wish of every revolutionary soldier.

During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary workers in the printing departments of the troops, together with the revolutionary masses, thoroughly exposed the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing in crazily opposing Mao Zedong Thought and resisting and sabotaging the publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works. With boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing, they accepted with greater political enthusiasm the glorious political task of printing a large number of Chairman Mao's works. They said, Chairman Mao's works are a spiritual atomic bomb thousands of times stronger than a material atomic bomb. They expressed that Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics, we will study them for life, use them for life, and print Chairman Mao's books for life, arming the minds of all cadres and soldiers in the army with great Mao Zedong Thought, and turning the entire army into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

The revolutionary workers in the printing departments of the troops have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production," with the greatest enthusiasm, the highest standards, and the fastest speed, doing everything possible to complete the glorious task of printing Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary workers of the 1201st Factory, through extensive learning and multiple experiments, mastered the wireless binding method, increasing work efficiency by more than two times. The large page inspection team of this factory is an advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works. Throughout the year, they have been guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought with boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, eliminating responsibility accidents, and creating a record of full-quality products. The revolutionary workers of the Guangzhou Military Region Printing Plant, in order to print more and better copies of Chairman Mao's works, launched a technical innovation campaign, designed and manufactured nine machines themselves, and completed the glorious task of printing "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" ahead of schedule this year.

The party committees and political organs at all levels of the People's Liberation Army attach great importance to the distribution of Chairman Mao's works. With great political enthusiasm, they quickly deliver Chairman Mao's works to the broad masses of cadres and soldiers. Many old Red Army soldiers who followed Chairman Mao in his southern and northern expeditions and outstanding political workers personally lead propaganda teams, carrying large quantities of Chairman Mao's works to companies, airfields, ships, and outposts, holding solemn book-giving ceremonies. The heroic sailors on the front lines of Fujian, upon receiving the task of transporting Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics, immediately set sail, braving the waves, and rushed to several dozen miles away to deliver "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to the cadres and soldiers stationed on the islands year-round. On the vast land of the motherland, from the foot of the Tian Mountains to the shores of the Bohai Sea, from the forests and snows to Hainan Island, wherever Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics are distributed, there is joy and excitement. The cadres and soldiers raise their arms and shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of Chairman Mao!" They sing loudly, "The East Is Red," "The Ship Sails on the Sea with a Rudder," and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao." The soldiers on the coastal defense front lines write in verse: "Chairman Mao's works are given to me, a million rays of light shine in my heart, revolutionaries with you, are like a ship with a rudder."

The extensive distribution of Chairman Mao's works has greatly encouraged the broad masses of cadres and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army who are fighting on the front lines of defending the motherland, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the "Three Supports, Two Militarys." They are determined to follow Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, "to study with problems in mind, to study and apply actively, to combine study with use, to study first what is urgently needed, to see immediate results, and to focus on the 'use' aspect," launching a larger, deeper, and more solid wave of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

    伟大毛泽东思想统帅全军天下无敌
    毛主席著作的大量发行，推动部队活学活用毛主席著作群众运动更加深入发展。战士挥笔写诗歌颂道：“毛主席著作发给我，万道金光照心窝，革命战士有了您，好比航船有了舵。”
    新华社二十八日讯　在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席的亲切关怀下，中国人民解放军出版、印刷、发行部门广大指战员和革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，今年印制了五千六百多万册毛主席著作。这是全军政治生活中的一件大喜事。毛主席著作的大量发行，更好地满足了全军广大指战员活学活用毛主席著作的迫切需要。
    今年人民解放军出版的毛主席著作，数量之多，质量之好，都是空前的。截至十二月二十八日，部队印制的毛主席著作共达五千六百二十六万册。其中《毛泽东选集》（一至四卷）达到了全军指战员和部队职工人手一部。印制的“老五篇”有一千二百五十万册，《毛主席语录》五百万册，《毛泽东著作选读》一百三十七万册。大批的毛主席著作，不仅满足了部队的需要，一部分还支援了地方，供应了广大革命群众。
    一九六○年林副主席主持军委工作以后，人民解放军广大指战员热烈响应林副主席的伟大号召，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决反对了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿抵制和破坏印制毛主席著作、疯狂反对毛泽东思想的罪行，全军印制的毛主席著作，数量一年比一年多，质量一年比一年好。活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，如滚滚洪流，一浪高过一浪，其势不可阻挡。“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，成了全军指战员的共同誓言；得到毛主席的革命宝书，成了每个革命战士的最大心愿。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，部队印刷部门的广大革命职工和广大革命群众一道，彻底清算了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿疯狂反对毛泽东思想，抵制和破坏出版、发行毛主席著作的滔天罪行。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的刻骨仇恨，以更大的政治热情接受了大量印制毛主席著作的光荣政治任务。他们说，毛主席著作是比物质原子弹强大千万倍的精神原子弹。他们表示，毛主席的革命宝书，我们要学一辈子，用一辈子，要印一辈子毛主席的书，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装全军指战员的头脑，把全军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    部队印刷部门广大革命职工，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，以最大的干劲，最高的标准，最快的速度，千方百计地努力完成印制毛主席著作的光荣任务。一二○一厂的革命职工经过广泛取经和多次试验，掌握了无线装订法，使工效提高两倍以上。这个厂的大页检查组，是学习毛主席著作的先进集体。一年来，他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无比忠诚的感情，坚持用战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导工作，全年消灭责任事故，创造了质量全优的纪录。广州部队印刷厂的革命职工，为了把毛主席著作印得更多更好，大闹技术革新，自己设计制造了九台机器，提前完成了今年印制《毛泽东选集》的光荣任务。
    人民解放军各级党委及政治机关极其重视毛主席著作的发行工作。他们以极大的政治热情，迅速地把毛主席著作送到广大指战员手中。许多跟随毛主席南征北战的老红军战士和优秀的政治工作人员，都亲自率领宣传队，带着大批毛主席著作，到连队、机场、舰艇、哨所，举行隆重的授书仪式。福建前线的英雄水兵们，一接到运送毛主席革命宝书的任务，立即出航，冒着惊涛骇浪，赶到几十里外，把《毛泽东选集》发给常年驻守在海岛上的指战员。在祖国辽阔的大地上，从天山脚下到渤海之滨，从林海雪原到海南岛，毛主席的革命宝书发行到那里，那里就一片欢腾。指战员们振臂高呼“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”放声高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》。海防前线的战士挥笔写诗：“毛主席著作发给我，万道金光照心窝，革命战士有了您，好比航船有了舵。”
    毛主席著作的大量发行，极大地鼓舞了战斗在保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”第一线上的人民解放军广大指战员。他们决心遵照林副主席的指示，“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”，掀起一个规模更大、更深入、更扎实的活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的高潮。
