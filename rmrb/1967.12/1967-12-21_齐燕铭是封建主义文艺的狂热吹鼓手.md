The counter-revolutionary revisionist Qi Yanming is a fervent advocate of feudal culture. For a long time, he has used his leadership position in government departments and his dual identity as a bourgeois reactionary "authority" to issue orders to the opera world, stirring up a reactionary feudal revivalist trend, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line, and fiercely opposing the socialist transformation of opera.

In early 1960, after he usurped the leadership of the former Ministry of Culture as Vice Minister and Party Secretary, under the support and direction of the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, he first targeted the enthusiasm for opera portraying modern life that had just emerged since 1958, proposing a counter-revolutionary policy of "modern plays, traditional plays, and newly adapted historical plays all coexisting," suppressing revolutionary modern plays. Then, in 1962, he proposed the reactionary slogan of "inherit first, criticize later" in the field of opera.

Marxists have never rejected the inheritance and reference of literary and artistic heritage from both China and abroad. However, the purpose of this inheritance and reference is for the people. Therefore, it is absolutely not allowed to praise the past and criticize the present, to praise any feudal poison, but rather to use Marxist methods to critically absorb all beneficial elements, as a mirror for the development of new culture. This has always been Chairman Mao's instruction to us.

Qi Yanming, however, fiercely opposes Chairman Mao's instructions. He worships and praises feudal things, saying that "things from a few hundred years ago still shine brightly today." "As long as they are harmless," "they are all beneficial to communist ideological education." To oppose Chairman Mao's instructions on critically accepting cultural heritage, Qi Yanming even blatantly says, "Inherit first, criticize later. In theory, this is wrong, but in practice, if you don't read an article from beginning to end, how can you criticize it? If you don't inherit these traditional plays and learn them, how can you criticize them? No matter how these plays are, only after learning them can they be criticized."

What a disgusting face of waving the red flag to oppose the red flag!

The essence of Marxism is critical and revolutionary. Its basic point is to criticize, to struggle, to revolutionize. For all cultural heritage, it must adopt a critical attitude, re-examine and re-evaluate, and use it appropriately based on raising the political awareness of the people. A certain art is a product of a certain stage of social development, and it bears the imprint of the times and the class. To say that the art of the feudal society a few hundred years ago "is all beneficial to communist ideological education" is absurd. Without analyzing and criticizing cultural heritage, how can we eliminate its dross and absorb its essence?

In fact, Qi Yanming's theory of "inherit first, criticize later" is to let feudal things spread rampantly. His so-called "criticism" is just a pretence. In a symposium, he said, "In dealing with heritage, we should have the spirit of both Western and traditional Chinese medicine. We should only allow learning and not allow criticism. Perhaps we should first have this spirit, then delve into it, sort it out, summarize it, and raise it." These words completely exposed Qi Yanming's true intentions.

Originally, Qi Yanming's theory of "inherit first, criticize later" is to first "revive" the "heritage of the feudal era," that is, to dig out, promote, and preserve all the things that glorify emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women, and feudal superstitions. This is his so-called "inheritance." The second step is to let those "scholars" who understand both Western and traditional Chinese culture use the bourgeois approach to "summarize and raise to a theoretical level," that is, to combine feudalism with bourgeois ideology, making the poison more potent. This is his so-called "criticism."

Qi Yanming's theory of "inherit first, criticize later" is a thorough and complete version of the reactionary theory of "complete inheritance." Qi Yanming proposed this reactionary theory with the intention of using the smoke screen of "inherit first, criticize later" to bring out emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women, letting them wreak havoc on the socialist stage, using these feudal things to "subtly influence" and corrupt revolutionary people, and preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism by the biggest capitalist roader within the Party.

Qi Yanming is not just talking. He uses his authority to repeatedly emphasize and seize every opportunity to use various methods and channels to provide conditions for the emergence of emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women.

He instructed publishers to mass-produce books that promote feudalism, poisoning the people. At the drama textbook conference, he proposed to publish more than a thousand textbooks, all of which promote emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women. At a meeting in Tianjin, he proposed to publish more than five hundred drama textbooks that promote emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women, such as "Wang Ersi Missing Her Husband," "Wang Shao'an Hurrying to the Boat," and so on, all of which promote the decadent sentiments and low tastes of the exploiting class. Even more sinister, Qi Yanming strongly advocated the so-called "newly adapted historical plays," using those ghosts and spirits to launch a ferocious attack on the Party and socialism. For example, under his leadership, the historical small series includes the anti-Party element Wu Han's "The Story of Hai Rui," as well as "Collected Works of Hai Rui," "Collected Works of Yu Qian," "Biography of Wei Zheng," and other big poisonous weeds.

He ordered the performance of bad and ghost plays, letting emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women occupy the stage. In 1960, Qi Yanming advocated the so-called "bottom-of-the-box movement," bringing all the old feudal operas that had not been performed for a long time back onto the stage. For a time, the stage was filled with chaos, with bad plays like "The Village of Evil Tigers," "The Chain of Intrigue," and "Washing the Floating Mountain" emerging in large numbers, and plays like "Capturing the Three Langs," "Huang's Daughter Visits the Underworld," and "Ma's Widow Opens a Shop" resurfacing. In 1961, Qi Yanming proposed the slogan of "rescuing heritage" and immediately sent people to various parts of the country to investigate and visit, to find out where there are old artists, what old art they have, and what materials from the feudal society they have left behind, and even said "record it if it can be recorded," "film it if it needs to be filmed," "record it in writing if it can be recorded in writing." It is not difficult to understand that he did this to find materials and open up roads for the performance of operas about emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women.

Qi Yanming's black hand is long. From publishing to the stage, from cultural relics exhibitions to holding ancient commemorations, he did not miss any. Under his instructions and support, the cultural departments were in chaos, especially during the three years of temporary difficulties, various ancient books and magazines full of feudal poison were printed in large quantities, and emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women filled the stage. According to statistics, in the first half of 1962, on the opera stage, the number of operas that promoted feudalism and capitalist thoughts reached more than 99% of the total number of performances, and modern opera plays were squeezed down to only 0.3%. Qi Yanming is a fervent promoter of feudalist and capitalist art.

Qi Yanming is not "ancient for the sake of being ancient." He fervently promotes and sells feudalist and capitalist art with the intention of eliminating proletarian art, causing a great flood of bourgeois art, and a complete restoration of feudalism and capitalism. This is particularly evident in his consistent hatred and opposition to revolutionary modern plays. He viciously slandered revolutionary modern plays; he slandered the performance of modern plays in Peking opera as "making a fool of oneself," "making people feel ridiculous after watching." Qi Yanming is a loyal descendant of feudal culture, a sworn enemy of revolutionary modern plays!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to sweep away the old ideology, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting class, and to establish new ideology, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, in one word, to establish Mao Zedong Thought. All those who attempt to block this historical tide will be swallowed and buried by the revolutionary torrent!

    齐燕铭是封建主义文艺的狂热吹鼓手
    边切
    反革命修正主义分子齐燕铭，是个封建文化的狂热鼓吹者。长期以来，他利用在政府部门窃取的领导地位和资产阶级反动“权威”的双重身份，向戏曲界发号施令，掀起一股反动的封建复古的逆流，同毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线相对抗，疯狂地反对戏曲的社会主义改造。
    一九六○年初，他窃取了旧文化部副部长、党组书记的领导权以后，在党内最大的一小撮走资派的支持和指挥下，首先把矛头指向一九五八年以来刚刚兴起的戏曲表现现代生活的热潮，抛出了一个所谓“现代戏、传统戏、新编历史剧三者并举”的反革命剧目方针，把革命的现代戏打下去。接着，一九六二年，他又在戏曲方面提出了“先继承，后批判”这个反动口号。
    马克思主义者从来不拒绝继承和借鉴中外的文学艺术遗产，但是这种继承和借鉴的目的是为了人民大众。因此，决不能颂古非今，赞扬任何封建的毒素，而必须用马克思主义的方法，批判地吸收其中一切有益的东西，以为发展新文化的借镜。这是毛主席历来对我们的教导。
    齐燕铭却竭力对抗毛主席的指示。他对那些封建主义的东西，顶礼膜拜，称颂备至，说这些“几百年前的东西，现在看起来还是金光灿烂的。”“只要是无害的”，“都是对共产主义思想教育有好处的。”为了对抗毛主席关于批判地接受文化遗产的指示，齐燕铭竟明目张胆地说什么：“先继承后批判，在理论上这样讲是错误的，但在实际上如果不把一篇文章从头到尾看完，怎么批判呢？这些传统戏你不继承，不把它学下来怎么批判呢？无论这些戏怎么样，只有在学下来之后，才能批判。”
    好一副打着“红旗”反红旗的丑恶嘴脸！
    马克思主义的本质是批判的、革命的。它的基本点就是要批判、要斗争、要革命。对于一切文化遗产，它都要以批判的态度，重新审查，重新检验，以提高人民的政治觉悟为基础，而加以适当的运用。一定的文艺是一定社会发展阶段的产物，它都带着时代的烙印，阶级的烙印。把几百年前封建社会的文艺，说成“都是对共产主义思想教育有好处的”，岂不是滑天下之大稽？对待文化遗产不加分析批判，把它分解为精华和糟粕两部分，怎么能排泄其糟粕，吸取其精华呢？
    其实，齐燕铭的“先继承后批判”论，是要让封建主义的东西大肆泛滥，所谓“批判”不过是故作姿态而已。他在一次座谈会上说：“对待遗产应该有西医学中医的精神。只准学习，不准批评。恐怕首先要有这种精神，然后钻进去加以整理、总结、提高。”这一席话，把齐燕铭的马脚完全暴露出来了。
    原来齐燕铭的“先继承后批判”论，第一步是要把“封建时代的遗产”都“扶起来”，也就是把那些宣扬帝王将相、才子佳人、封建迷信的东西统统挖出来，捧起来，保起来。这就是他的所谓“继承”。第二步是让那些“懂西又懂中”的反党反社会主义的“有志之士”，用资产阶级的一套“总结提高”，“科学地系统地提高到理论水平”，也就是把封建主义的东西和资产阶级的东西合流，使之毒上加毒。这就是他的所谓“批判”。
    齐燕铭的“先继承后批判”论，是彻头彻尾反动的“全盘继承”论的翻版。齐燕铭所以提出这个反动理论，目的是妄图利用“先继承、后批判”这层烟幕，把帝王将相、才子佳人统统放出来，让它们在社会主义的舞台上兴妖作怪，用这些封建主义的东西来“潜移默化”、腐蚀革命人民，为党内最大的走资派复辟资本主义准备舆论。
    齐燕铭绝不是说说而已。他利用职权，三令五申，抓紧一切机会，想尽各种办法，通过各种途径，为帝王将相、才子佳人的出笼提供条件。
    他指示出版社大量出版宣扬封建主义的坏书，毒害人民群众。在剧目教材会议上，他提出要出版的一千多种教材，全部是宣扬帝王将相、才子佳人的。在天津召开的一次会议上，他又提出要出版五百来种宣扬帝王将相、才子佳人的剧目教材，什么《王二姐思夫》《王少安赶船》……等等，都是宣扬剥削阶级的没落情调和低级趣味的。更恶毒的是齐燕铭极力提倡所谓“新编历史剧”，借那些幽魂厉鬼向党向社会主义猖狂进攻。如在他领导下所编的历史小丛书中，有反党分子吴晗编的《海瑞的故事》，还有《海瑞集》《于谦集》《魏征传》等等大毒草。
    他勒令大演坏戏、鬼戏，让帝王将相、才子佳人盘踞舞台。一九六○年，齐燕铭倡导所谓“翻箱底运动”，把久已不演的封建旧戏曲统统搬上舞台。一时乌云乱翻，《恶虎村》《连环套》《洗浮山》等坏戏大批出笼，《活捉三郎》《黄氏女游阴》《马寡妇开店》等又重新泛滥。一九六一年，齐燕铭又提出“抢救遗产”的口号，并马上派人到全国各地去调查访问，要弄清什么地方有老艺人，他们身上有什么旧艺术，有什么封建社会遗留下来的资料，而且说“能录音的要录音”，“需要拍电影的要拍电影”，“能用文字记载的要记载下来”。不难明白，他这样做是为进一步大演帝王将相、才子佳人戏寻找原料，开辟道路。
    齐燕铭的黑手伸得很长。从出版阵地、戏剧舞台、文物展览到搞复古纪念，他一个也不放过。在他的指使和支持下，文化部门被搞得乌烟瘴气，特别是三年暂时困难时期，各种充满封建毒素的古籍书刊大量印行，帝王将相、才子佳人充斥舞台。根据统计，一九六二年上半年，在戏曲舞台上，宣扬封建主义、资本主义思想的戏曲剧目，竟达上演剧目总数的百分之九十九以上，现代戏剧目被压挤得只剩下千分之三。齐燕铭是封建主义、资本主义文艺的狂热吹鼓手。
    齐燕铭绝不是“为古而古”。他这样狂热地鼓吹和推销封建主义、资本主义的文艺，目的是要挤掉无产阶级的文艺，来一个地主资产阶级文艺的大泛滥，来一个封建主义和资本主义的总复辟。这突出地表现在他一贯仇视和反对革命的现代戏。他恶毒地谩骂革命现代戏；他污蔑京剧演革命现代戏是“出洋相”，“看后使人有滑稽之感”。齐燕铭是封建文化的孝子贤孙，是革命现代戏的死敌！
    无产阶级文化大革命要大扫剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，大立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，一句话，大立毛泽东思想。一切企图阻挡这历史潮流的人，必将被这革命的怒涛所吞没，所埋葬！
