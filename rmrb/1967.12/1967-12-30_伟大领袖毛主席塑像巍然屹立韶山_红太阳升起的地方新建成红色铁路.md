Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly higher in all of China and the world!

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 29. Our hearts' red sun, our beloved great leader Chairman Mao's hometown—Shaoshan, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—held a grand gathering of 100,000 people on December 28 to celebrate the completion of Chairman Mao's statue and the opening of the Shaoshan Railway.

The statue of our great leader Chairman Mao vividly depicts his youthful image. The statue is six meters high and stands on a pedestal that is 6.26 meters high. It stands on the hill in Qingxi Production Brigade, Shaoshan People's Commune, where Chairman Mao once held mass meetings, facing the newly built Shaoshan Railway Station. Since the construction of the statue began in May this year, many revolutionary workers, Red Guards, and technical personnel from various places have participated in the glorious task of building the statue with boundless love for Chairman Mao.

The completion of Chairman Mao's statue and the arrival of the red railway in the place where the red sun rises is a great joy for the people of China and the revolutionary people of the world. On December 28, colorful arches were set up along the main roads around Shaoshan Railway Station. Revolutionary masses from Changsha, Xiangtan, Zhuzhou, Xiangxiang, Ningxiang, and other places rushed to the venue overnight, joyfully drumming and gonging, surging into the venue like a tide. Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and PLA soldiers from various places paid tribute and showed their respect under Chairman Mao's statue. Many people made a solemn vow in front of the statue: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao!"

The heroes who participated in the construction of the Shaoshan Railway, the revolutionary pioneers from various fronts, and the representatives of the PLA stationed in Hunan Province had the honor of taking the first train from Changsha and Zhuzhou to Shaoshan. When the train slowly entered the station and the ribbon-cutting ceremony was held, the revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and PLA soldiers who had been waiting at the station cheered loudly. The slogans "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Ten thousand years!" echoed through the mountains and lasted for a long time.

The Shaoshan Railway connects with the Xiangqian Railway in Xiangxiang County, Hunan Province (formerly Matoupu Station) and connects with the Jingguang Railway in Zhuzhou City through the Xiangqian Line. The completion of this red railway will transport more revolutionary people to the place where the red sun rises, where they will be nourished by the great Mao Zedong Thought and draw endless revolutionary strength.

At the grand celebration meeting, Li Yuan, the head of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the responsible comrade of the 69000 Unit, spoke. He said that the completion of Chairman Mao's statue and the Shaoshan Railway is a victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought and a victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is also a concentrated expression of the boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty of the broad proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers to our beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

Li Yuan said that the broad revolutionary masses call the Shaoshan Railway the red road for spreading Mao Zedong Thought, the battle road for guiding the people of the world to seek liberation, the victory road for uniting the proletariat of the world to fight against imperialism and revisionism, and the revolutionary road for training red successors. In the future, we will better receive revolutionary people to the place where the red sun rises to pay tribute and learn, so that the glorious achievements of our great leader Chairman Mao can be more widely and deeply spread throughout China and the world. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly higher in all of China and the world!

Li Yuan said that our great leader Chairman Mao led the Chinese people in the longest, most complex, most arduous, and largest-scale revolution in the world to liberate the Chinese people. He has opened up the most correct, brightest, and happiest revolutionary path for all humanity. We enthusiastically hail: The world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. The blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, illuminate the course of carrying the proletarian revolution through to the end. Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self" as the key link, vigorously run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, quickly achieve, consolidate, and develop revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination, deeply carry out revolutionary great criticism and the struggle-criticism-transformation of one's own unit, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and make the place where the red sun rises—Hunan—a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletarian revolutionary masses, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and local military representatives who participated in the celebration meeting also spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically hailing the completion of Chairman Mao's statue and the opening of the Shaoshan Railway.

The great leader Chairman Mao's hometown, Shaoshan, is a revolutionary holy land that all revolutionary people in China and the world yearn for day and night. Broad revolutionary people travel thousands of miles to Shaoshan to pay tribute to Chairman Mao's former residence and to study Mao Zedong Thought. After liberation, the people of Chairman Mao's hometown, out of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, built a road from Xiangtan to Shaoshan. However, this still could not satisfy the broad revolutionary people's wish to go to Shaoshan to pay tribute to Chairman Mao's former residence and to study the great Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party feared that the revolutionary people would study and master Mao Zedong Thought, so they obstructed the construction of Shaoshan in every possible way and ignored the revolutionary masses' request to improve Shaoshan's transportation. During this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad proletarian revolutionary masses and Red Guards thoroughly exposed the handful of capitalist roaders within the party's conspiracy to obstruct the improvement of Shaoshan's transportation and restrict the revolutionary people from going to Shaoshan to study Mao Zedong Thought, and put forward the initiative to immediately build the Shaoshan Railway. Their initiative was supported by the Party Central Committee and the broad revolutionary masses across the country.

At the beginning of this year, when the news of the imminent construction of the Shaoshan Railway spread, revolutionary masses from all over the country enthusiastically cheered. At that time, many Red Guards on the Long March rushed to the great leader Chairman Mao's hometown. They considered it the greatest honor to be able to carry a load of soil or shed a drop of sweat for the red railway. A Uyghur female Red Guard rushed to the construction site day and night, saying: "Chairman Mao is the great savior of all ethnic groups. Building a railway in Chairman Mao's hometown is a great joy for all ethnic groups. I must carry a few loads of soil to express the Uyghur people's love for Chairman Mao." Many workers from other provinces who returned to Hunan for a visit brought their own luggage, bought train tickets, and came to Shaoshan to participate in the intense labor, spending the most meaningful holiday. The poor and lower-middle peasants from Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, and Ningxiang counties in Hunan Province carried red flags, held up portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao, and carried luggage and tools, crossing mountains and rivers to the railway construction site. They said proudly: "The Shaoshan Railway is a revolutionary road, a road for spreading Mao Zedong Thought. We poor and lower-middle peasants must build this road well!"

More than 30,000 laborers, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao in their hearts, gathered from all directions to the construction site and engaged in the glorious labor of building the red railway. They wielded pickaxes, shouldered heavy loads, cut through mountains, and filled valleys, writing a magnificent poem in the construction of the road.

Nearly 200 factories and enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, which were responsible for processing and ordering the materials needed for this railway, regarded supporting the construction of the red railway as their greatest happiness and greatest honor. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," they completed their tasks excellently with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," making a contribution to the construction of the red railway.

A railway leading to our hearts' red sunrise place, Shaoshan, has been successfully built. This is a great joy for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. On the morning of December 28, when the first train arrived at Shaoshan Railway Station, the representatives who took this train to participate in the opening ceremony sang "The East Is Red" with boundless happiness and excitement in their hearts.

    新华社长沙二十九日电　我们心中的红太阳、我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的家乡——湖南省湘潭县韶山，二十八日有十万人隆重集会，最热烈地庆祝伟大领袖毛主席的塑像落成和韶山铁路胜利通车。
    伟大领袖毛主席的塑像，再现了毛主席青年时代的光辉形象。这座塑像高六米，建造在高六点二六米的台座上。塑像巍然屹立在毛主席曾经召开过群众大会的韶山公社清溪大队的山岗上，面对新建的韶山车站。这座塑像今年五月开始筹建以来，各地许多革命工人、红卫兵小将、技术人员，怀着无限热爱毛主席的感情，参加了建造塑像的光荣工作。
    毛主席的塑像落成和红色铁路通到红太阳升起的地方，这是全国人民和全世界革命人民的大喜事。二十八日，韶山车站周围的交通要道搭起了一道道彩门，从长沙、湘潭、株洲、湘乡、宁乡等地连夜赶来参加庆祝大会的革命群众，喜气洋洋，敲锣打鼓，象潮水般涌进会场。来自各地的革命工人、贫下中农、革命干部、红卫兵小将和解放军指战员，在毛主席的塑像下瞻仰、致敬，许多人在塑像前齐表决心：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！”
    参加兴建韶山铁路的英雄们，各条战线上的革命闯将，中国人民解放军驻湖南省部队的代表们，荣幸地乘坐第一次列车，从长沙、株洲来到韶山。当列车徐徐进入车站并举行剪彩仪式时，早在车站迎候的无产阶级革命派、革命群众、红卫兵小将和人民解放军指战员，欢声雷动。“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”的口号声，震撼群山，经久不息。
    韶山铁路同湘黔铁路湖南境内的湘乡县向韶站（原马托铺站）接轨，通过湘黔线在株洲市与京广铁路连接。这条红色铁路的建成，将把更多的革命人民运送到红太阳升起的地方，从这里受到伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育，汲取无穷无尽的革命力量。
    在盛大的庆祝大会上，湖南省革命委员会筹备小组组长、六九○○部队负责人黎原同志讲了话。他说，毛主席的光辉塑像和韶山铁路的建成，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，也是广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员，对我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的集中表现。
    黎原说，广大革命群众把韶山铁路称作传播毛泽东思想的红色路，指引世界人民求解放的战斗路，联合全世界无产者反帝反修的胜利路，培养锻炼红色接班人的革命路。今后，我们要更多更好地接待革命人民来到红太阳升起的地方瞻仰、学习，让我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉业绩，更加广泛、更加深入地传遍全中国，传遍全世界。让毛泽东思想伟大红旗更高地在全中国飘扬，在全世界飘扬！
    黎原说，我们伟大领袖毛主席为了中国人民的翻身解放，领导中国人民进行了世界上最长期、最复杂、最艰苦、最大规模的革命斗争，为我们开辟了全人类最正确、最光明、最幸福的革命航道。我们热烈欢呼：世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，照亮了将无产阶级革命进行到底的航程。紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，迅速实现、巩固和发展革命大联合和革命三结合，深入开展革命大批判和本单位的斗批改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把红太阳升起的地方——湖南办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    参加庆祝大会的无产阶级革命派、贫下中农、红卫兵小将和当地驻军代表等，也分别在大会上发言，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席的塑像落成和韶山铁路胜利通车。
    伟大领袖毛主席的家乡韶山，是全中国和全世界革命人民日夜向往的革命圣地。广大革命人民为了瞻仰毛主席旧居，为了学习毛泽东思想，不远万里，来到韶山。解放以后，毛主席家乡的人民出于对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，从湘潭到韶山兴建了一条公路，但仍然不能满足广大革命人民到韶山瞻仰毛主席旧居、学习伟大的毛泽东思想的愿望。过去，党内一小撮走资派害怕革命人民学习和掌握毛泽东思想，他们对毛主席家乡韶山的建设百般阻挠，对革命群众关于改善韶山交通的要求置之不理。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，彻底揭露了党内一小撮走资派阻挠改善韶山交通、限制革命人民到韶山学习毛泽东思想的阴谋，提出了立即修建韶山铁路的倡议。他们的倡议，得到了党中央的支持，得到了全国广大革命群众的支持。
    今年年初，当韶山铁路即将动工的喜讯传开以后，从长城内外到大江南北，从天山脚下到东海之滨，全国各地革命群众热烈欢呼。当时，跋涉在长征途中的许多红卫兵小将，直奔伟大领袖毛主席的家乡，他们以能够为红色铁路挑一担土、流一滴汗为最大光荣。一位维吾尔族女红卫兵日夜兼程，赶到工地，她说：“毛主席是各族人民的大救星。毛主席家乡修铁路，这是各族人民的大喜事。我怎么也要挑上几担土，表达维吾尔族人民热爱毛主席的心情。”不少从外地回湖南探亲的职工，自带行李，自己买汽车票，来到韶山，投入紧张的劳动，度过了最有意义的探亲假。湖南湘潭、湘乡、宁乡三个县的贫下中农，打着红旗，高举毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，挑着行李、工具，跨山越水，来到铁路工地。他们豪迈地说：“韶山铁路是革命的路，是传播毛泽东思想的路，我们贫下中农一定要修好这条路！”
    三万多劳动大军，就是这样怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，从四面八方汇集到工地，投入了建设红色铁路的光荣劳动。他们手挥铁镐，肩挑重担，劈高山，填沟壑，在建路中写下了壮丽诗篇。
    承担这条铁路所需器材加工订货任务的北京、上海、天津、河北、辽宁、四川、陕西、湖北、江西、广东、广西、湖南等省、市、自治区近二百个厂矿企业的革命职工，把支援红色铁路的建设当作自己最大的幸福，最大的光荣。他们在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，出色地完成任务，为红色铁路的建设做出了贡献。（附图片）
    一条通往我们心中的红太阳升起的地方的韶山铁路胜利建成了。这是中国人民和全世界革命人民的大喜事。十二月二十八日上午，当第一次列车到达韶山车站时，乘坐这次列车参加通车盛典的代表们，怀着无限幸福和激动的心情，高声歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
