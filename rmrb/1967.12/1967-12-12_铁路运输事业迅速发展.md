    Before liberation, under the rule of the reactionary government, Albania was the only country in Europe without a railroad. After liberation, under the leadership of the Labor Party, the Albanian people quickly built the first railroad in Albanian history, the Durres-Pec line.

    Since then, in the past twenty years, the people's government has successively built many more railroad lines. For example, two years after the Durres-Pec line was completed, the Durres-Tirana line was opened in 1949. In 1950, the Pec-Elbasan line was also completed. In 1963, the Vora-Lac railroad line was built. In recent years, the state has added several branch lines, strengthening transportation in industrial and mining areas. Currently, Albanian youth are responding to the call of the Albanian Labor Party, working with revolutionary enthusiasm to build the Logjcaj-Fier railroad line through voluntary labor, which is expected to be completed next year.

　　铁路运输事业迅速发展
    解放前，在反动政权统治下，阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲唯一没有铁路的国家。解放后阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党领导下，迅速修筑了阿尔巴尼亚历史上第一条都拉斯—佩钦铁路。
    此后，在近二十年里，人民政权又陆续新建了许多铁路线，如在都拉斯—佩钦线建成两年以后，一九四九年都拉斯—地拉那线通车了。一九五○年，佩钦—爱尔巴桑线又通车了。一九六三年，伏拉—拉奇铁路线建成。这几年来，国家还增建了一些铁路支线，加强了工矿地区的交通运输。目前，阿尔巴尼亚青年正响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的号召，满怀革命热情地用义务劳动来修建洛格齐恩—费里铁路线，预计明年即可竣工。
