The people of Dazhai consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all their actions. Political thought greatly enhanced, agricultural production bountiful.

The total grain yield for the summer and autumn seasons exceeded the highest historical yield by 12 percent, with the average yield per mu increasing from over 800 jin to over 900 jin.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 24th: In 1967, the year when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved decisive victory, the political thought of the people of Dazhai Brigade, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, has been greatly enhanced, and agricultural production has been bountiful.

Currently, Dazhai has formed a conscious mass movement to study the works of Chairman Mao. The teachings of Chairman Mao have become the guiding principle for all actions of the people of Dazhai. Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. The revolutionary criticism has completely exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev. Cadres and community members consciously study, consciously fight against selfishness, consciously criticize revisionism, and consciously work, elevating their spiritual outlook to a new level. The spirit of great publicness of the proletariat is growing and flourishing.

The enhancement of political thought has brought about a bountiful harvest in agricultural production. This year, the production, construction, and income of Dazhai Brigade have surpassed any previous year. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, they built a 14-li long irrigation canal, transforming more than half of the gullies in this region, which suffers from drought nine out of ten years, into irrigated land. The entire brigade now has an average of one mu of high-standard terraced fields per person, with flat plots, deep soil layers, and resistance to drought—these are known as "Dazhai Fields." The grain crops for the summer and autumn seasons this year have all been bountiful. The total grain yield exceeded the highest historical yield by 12 percent, with the average yield per mu increasing from over 800 jin in recent years to over 900 jin. Community members have all moved into new houses.

The past year has proven that the people of Dazhai, who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are the vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the vanguards of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and models of combining revolution with production.

The people of Dazhai have an extremely deep class sentiment for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They persist in studying and applying the works of Chairman Mao, learning a bit and applying a bit, learning a sentence and applying a sentence. They will never forget that the journey of Dazhai Brigade's growth is the journey of the people of Dazhai "reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

After more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, especially after the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism," the people of Dazhai have taken "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key task. They have organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively studying and applying the works of Chairman Mao with even greater enthusiasm, self-awareness, and higher standards. They say: selfishness and revisionism are linked; if you don't fight against selfishness, you can't criticize revisionism. They have elevated the struggle against selfishness to the level of a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, to the level of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and to the level of firmly defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The chairman of the Poor Peasants' Association, Jia Jincai, studies the quotations of Chairman Mao every day, thinking about them all the time, and applying them in everything he does, but he feels it is still not enough. The people of Dazhai fight against selfishness, not just against "one's own viewpoint," but also against the enlarged "one's own viewpoint"—the small collective viewpoint, ensuring that they always think from the perspective of the greater good. This year, to support the brother brigades, they dug a large reservoir in places where they could irrigate more land for other villages. They say: we can't just think about Dazhai Brigade; we must help the brother brigades catch up with Dazhai.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people of Dazhai have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, fiercely exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev. China's Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi saw the red flag of Dazhai as a thorn in their eye and a bone in their throat, trying every means to cut it down. The broad revolutionary masses of Shanxi Province, in the January Revolution storm of Shanghai, seized power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Led by Comrade Chen Yonggui, the people of Dazhai, with the great Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, have waged a long and tenacious struggle against this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, foiling their plot to cut down the red flag of Dazhai. Chen Yonggui, at the struggle meeting against the capitalist roaders in Xiyang, angrily exposed the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in opposing Dazhai. The people of Dazhai realized that China's Khrushchev and his agents opposing Dazhai was not just a matter of one brigade, but a matter of opposing the great leader Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and opposing the entire Chinese countryside taking the socialist road. They treated the revolutionary criticism as a top priority related to the fate of the country and the fate of the world revolution, with everyone taking action, adopting various forms, fiercely exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev, enhancing proletarian consciousness, and laying a more solid and powerful ideological foundation for Dazhai to advance along the socialist road.

Since this year, Dazhai Brigade has earnestly implemented the policy of "combining revolution with production" proposed by the great leader Chairman Mao. Throughout the year, the people of Dazhai have consistently adhered to the principle of working during the day and making revolution at night, without any cadres or community members leaving their production posts. Party Secretary Chen Yonggui said: The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution should have an unprecedented bountiful harvest. Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us to "combine revolution with production," and we have done so, grasping the revolution and promoting production.

In 1967, Dazhai underwent tremendous changes and achieved the greatest honor. The people of Dazhai attribute all the changes and all the honors to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the great Mao Zedong Thought, to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the moment of celebrating the new achievements of the past year, the people of Dazhai remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "being humble, prudent, guarding against arrogance and impatience," and are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to better study and apply the works of Chairman Mao, to more humbly learn from the advanced experiences of all parts of the country, with the greatest determination and the greatest effort, to scale new heights in the new year.

    大寨人自觉地用毛泽东思想指导自己的一切行动
    政治思想大提高  农业生产大丰收
    夏秋两季粮食总产量比历史上最高年产量增长百分之十二，平均亩产量由八百多斤上升到九百多
    据新华社太原二十四日电　山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队，在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的一九六七年，政治思想大提高，农业生产大丰收。
    现在的大寨，学习毛主席著作形成了自觉的群众运动，毛主席的教导成为大寨人一切行动的指南，毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线深入人心。革命的大批判，使中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线在这里完全破产。干部和社员自觉学习，自觉斗私，自觉批修，自觉劳动，精神面貌进入了新的境界，无产阶级的大公思想在成长壮大。
    政治思想的提高，带来了农业生产的丰收。今年，大寨大队的生产、建设和收入超过了以往任何一年。他们在解放军的帮助下，修了一条十四里长的水渠，使这个十年九旱的地区，有一半以上的沟地变成了水浇地。全大队平均每人有了一亩地块平、活土层深、不怕旱的高标准梯田——“大寨田”。今年夏秋两季粮食作物都获大丰收，粮食总产量比历史上最高年产量增长百分之十二，平均亩产量由几年来的八百多斤上升到九百多斤，社员都住上了新房新窑。
    一年来铁的事实证明，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的大寨人，是无产阶级文化大革命的闯将，是捍卫毛主席革命路线的尖兵，是抓革命、促生产的模范。
    大寨人对伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想有着无比深厚的阶级感情。他们坚持活学活用毛主席著作，学一点，用一点，学一句，用一句。他们永远不会忘记，大寨大队成长的里程，就是大寨人“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”的里程。
    经过一年多的文化大革命，特别是伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的号召以后，大寨人以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，热情更旺，自觉性更高，要求更严。他们说：私和修，挂着钩；斗不掉私，就批不倒修。他们把破私立公提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度，提高到无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，坚决保卫毛主席革命路线的高度。贫协主任贾进才学习毛主席语录，天天学，时时想，事事用，但他觉得还很不够。大寨人斗私，不仅斗“一口观”，还斗放大了的“一口观”——小集体观念，做到处处从大局着想。今年，他们为了支援兄弟队，在能够多浇外村土地的地方挖了一个大蓄水池。他们说：不能光为大寨一个队着想，要帮助兄弟大队赶上大寨。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，大寨人高举革命大批判旗帜，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山西的代理人把大寨这面红旗看成眼中钉，肉中刺，千方百计企图把它砍倒。山西省广大无产阶级革命派在上海“一月革命”风暴中，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权。以陈永贵同志为首的大寨人，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，同这一伙反革命修正主义分子进行了长期的顽强的斗争，使他们妄图把大寨这面红旗砍倒的阴谋没有得逞。陈永贵在昔阳批斗党内走资派的大会上，愤怒揭发了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人大反大寨的罪行。大寨人认清了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人大反大寨，绝不仅是对待大寨一个大队的问题，而是反对伟大领袖毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的革命路线，反对整个中国农村走社会主义道路的问题。他们把革命大批判当作关系国家命运和关系世界革命的命运的头等大事，人人行动起来，采取各种形式，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，提高了无产阶级觉悟，为大寨沿着社会主义道路阔步前进打下了更加巩固更加雄厚的思想基础。
    今年以来，大寨大队认真贯彻执行了伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。一年来，大寨人一直坚持了白天搞生产，晚上闹革命，没有出现过干部、社员脱离生产岗位的现象。党支部书记陈永贵同志说：史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，就应该有一个史无前例的大丰收。我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们“抓革命，促生产”，我们照办了，革命抓住了，生产上来了。
    一九六七年，大寨发生了巨大变化，得到了最大荣誉。大寨人把所有的变化，把所有的荣誉，都归功于伟大领袖毛主席，归功于伟大的毛泽东思想，归功于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，归功于史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。在欢庆一年来新成果的时刻，大寨人牢记毛主席“谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁”的教导，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更虚心地学习全国各地的先进经验，以最大的决心，最大的干劲，在新的一年里，攀登新的高峰。
