According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Stockholm, the Swedish magazine "Spark" recently published an article commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The article points out that revolutionaries from all over the world are rallying around the Chinese Communist Party and the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao. The Soviet people will surely take the Chinese Cultural Revolution as an example to overthrow the rule of revisionism and re-establish the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union.

The article states: Fifty years ago, the October Revolution in Russia realized the thoughts of Marx and Engels on the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin stood at the forefront. Under Lenin's leadership, the Russian workers and peasants defeated the class enemies both at home and abroad, won the first victory of the proletarian revolution, and established the first state of proletarian dictatorship. After Lenin's death, under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Union had transformed from a backward agricultural country into an industrialized socialist country.

The article emphasizes that after the great victory of the October Revolution, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, went through more than twenty years of arduous struggle to liberate China from the oppression of imperialism and its running dogs, established the People's Republic of China, and are now advancing on the socialist road.

The article says: The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has betrayed Lenin and socialism. They abolished the dictatorship of the proletariat and replaced it with a "state of the whole people," which in fact is the dictatorship of the privileged class over the proletariat and the masses. They talk about communism but actually implement policies that lead to a retreat to capitalism. In foreign policy, their line means surrendering to the imperialists, cooperating with them, and suppressing proletarian revolutionaries and national revolutionaries. They are traitors to the cause of socialism in the Soviet Union and traitors to the international proletariat and oppressed peoples. The article continues: However, their rule will not last long. Revolutionary communists are now working in various places in the Soviet Union with the aim of launching a new revolution to overthrow the rule of revisionism and re-establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The article stresses: Revolutionaries from all over the world are rallying around the Chinese Communist Party and the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have shown how to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat through the Cultural Revolution and thwart the attempts of the bourgeoisie to regain power and restore capitalism from within.

The article concludes with the firm belief that the Soviet people will surely take the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution as a practical example and rise up in revolution.

    瑞典《星火》赞颂毛主席创造性地发展了马列主义
    世界革命者正集合在毛主席周围
    苏联人民必将以中国文化大革命为榜样起来革命
    据新华社斯德哥尔摩电  瑞典《星火》杂志，最近在一篇纪念十月革命五十周年的文章中指出，全世界的革命者正集合在中国共产党和当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席的周围，苏联人民必将以中国的无产阶级文化大革命为榜样，推翻修正主义的统治，在苏联重新建立无产阶级专政。
    文章说：五十年前，俄国十月革命实现了马克思和恩格斯关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的思想。列宁站在最前头。列宁领导俄国工人和农民打败了国内外的阶级敌人，赢得了第一次无产阶级革命的胜利，建立了第一个无产阶级专政的国家。列宁逝世以后，在斯大林的领导下，苏联已经从一个落后的农业国变成了一个工业化的社会主义国家。
    文章着重指出，在十月革命的伟大胜利之后，中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下，经过二十多年的艰苦斗争，把中国从帝国主义及其在中国的走狗的压迫下解放出来，建立了中华人民共和国，现在正在社会主义大道上前进。
    文章说：苏联修正主义领导集团背叛了列宁和社会主义。他们取消了无产阶级专政，代之以“全民国家”，这事实上是特权阶层对无产阶级和人民群众的专政。他们讲的是共产主义，而实际上执行的是促使倒退到资本主义的政策。在外交政策方面，他们奉行的路线意味着向帝国主义者投降，同他们合作，镇压无产阶级革命者和民族革命者。他们是苏联社会主义事业的叛徒，是国际工人阶级和被压迫人民的叛徒。文章接着说：但是，他们的统治不会长久。革命的共产党人今天在苏联各地进行工作，目的是要发动一场新的革命，推翻修正主义的统治，重新建立无产阶级专政。
    文章强调说：全世界的革命者正集合在中国共产党和当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的周围。毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。中国共产党和毛泽东同志指明了人们如何通过文化大革命，加强无产阶级专政，挫败资产阶级在内部重新掌权和复辟资本主义的企图。
    文章最后表示坚信，苏联人民必将以中国无产阶级文化大革命为实际榜样，起来进行革命。
