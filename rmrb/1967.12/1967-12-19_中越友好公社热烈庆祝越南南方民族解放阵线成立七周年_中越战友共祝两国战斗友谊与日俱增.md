The Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Commune warmly celebrated the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Sino-Vietnamese comrades-in-arms gathered to wish for the ever-growing combat friendship between the two countries.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 18th, members of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune in Beijing held a gathering today to warmly celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The delegation of the people of South Vietnam was invited to attend the celebration. Comrades-in-arms from China and Vietnam gathered together, wishing for the ever-growing combat friendship between the two peoples, which will last forever.

Today, the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune was filled with a spirit of combat and unity. Members held up portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and carried red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically welcoming the heroic messengers from the people of South Vietnam.

The responsible person of the commune said at the celebration that over the past seven years, the heroic people of South Vietnam, under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front, have creatively applied and developed the great thought of people's war, making the world's number one bandit—the U.S. imperialists—suffer heavy losses and retreat in disarray. This is a miracle in the history of war, a magnificent feat of the Vietnamese people, and a great cause that shakes heaven and earth. He praised the Vietnamese people for setting a great example of daring to fight and daring to win for all oppressed peoples and nations in the world. He emphasized that we and Vietnam are brothers who depend on each other, and neighbors who share weal and woe. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will more effectively support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war until final victory.

In the midst of warm applause, Nguyen Xuan Long, the head of the delegation of the people of South Vietnam, spoke. He enthusiastically praised the great achievements of our country and deeply thanked the seven hundred million Chinese people for their great support. He said, on the day of celebrating the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, we gather together and have seen your great achievements with our own eyes. The rear of the Vietnamese people has become even more solid. In our anti-American national salvation war, we have always received the great and effective support of the brotherly Chinese people. On this occasion, we express our deepest gratitude to the respected Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people.

Le Thi Chi, the deputy head of the delegation of the people of South Vietnam, said at the celebration that over the past seven years, the military and people of South Vietnam have continuously defeated the U.S. imperialists and achieved new victories. The U.S. imperialists are in a situation from which they cannot extricate themselves, and the puppet army is disintegrating in large numbers. The military and people of South Vietnam are in a favorable position, actively attacking and winning. She said that in the face-to-face struggle with the vicious enemy and in the revolutionary storm, many shining examples of indomitable spirit have emerged among the armed forces, militia, women, and youth of South Vietnam.

The delegation of the people of South Vietnam also visited the commune under the accompaniment of Ding Xilin, a member of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association.

　　中越友好公社热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年
　　中越战友共祝两国战斗友谊与日俱增
    据新华社十八日讯  北京中越友好人民公社社员，今天集会热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年。越南南方人民代表团应邀参加了庆祝会。中越两国战友欢聚在一起，共祝两国人民的战斗友谊与日俱增，万古长青。
    今天，中越友好人民公社洋溢着战斗和团结气氛。社员高举我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像和越南人民伟大领袖胡志明主席的画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，热情地欢迎英雄的越南南方人民的使者。
    公社负责人在庆祝会上说，七年来，英雄的越南南方人民在民族解放阵线的正确领导下，创造性地运用和发展了人民战争的伟大思想，把世界上头号强盗——美帝国主义打得焦头烂额、狼狈不堪，这是战争史上的奇观，越南人民的壮举，惊天动地的伟业。他赞扬越南人民为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族树立了一个敢于斗争、敢于胜利的伟大榜样。他强调说，我们和越南是唇齿相依的兄弟，患难与共的邻邦。经过无产阶级文化大革命，我们将更有效地支援兄弟的越南人民的抗美救国战争，直到取得最后胜利。
    越南南方人民代表团团长阮春龙在热烈的掌声中讲话。他热情地赞颂我国所取得的伟大成就，深切地感谢七亿中国人民的巨大支持。他说，在庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的日子里，我们欢聚一起，亲眼看到了你们所取得的伟大成就。我们越南人民的后方变得更加巩固了。我们在抗美救国战争中，一直得到兄弟的中国人民的巨大和有效的支持。借此机会，向敬爱的毛主席、中国共产党和中国人民表示深切的感谢。
    越南南方人民代表团副团长黎氏芝在庆祝会上说，七年来，越南南方军民连续不断地打败了美帝国主义，不断地取得新的胜利。美帝国主义陷于不能自拔的境地，伪军大量瓦解。越南南方军民正处于优势，处于主动进攻和胜利的地位。她说，在同凶恶的敌人进行面对面的斗争中，在革命的暴风雨中，越南南方人民武装、民兵、妇女和青少年中涌现出了许多坚强不屈的光辉榜样。
    越南南方人民代表团还在中越友协理事丁西林陪同下，参观了公社。
