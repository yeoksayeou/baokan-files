Approved by the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the title of "Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Model was conferred upon Comrade Li Wenzhong, along with Comrades Li Congquan and Chen Diankui, who sacrificed their lives to rescue the Red Guards of Chairman Mao. Recently, three new soldiers joined the unit where the martyrs had served, the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company of the 601st Unit of the People's Liberation Army, becoming the honorable soldiers of the "Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Platoon.

The three new soldiers are Li Wenhong, the younger brother of martyr Li Wenzhong; Li Congwei, the elder brother of Li Congquan; and Chen Dianbing, the younger brother of Chen Diankui. Their original names were Li Wenxiao, Li Congyi, and Chen Dianjia. To learn from the revolutionary qualities of the Red Guards who loved Chairman Mao, they joined the army, discussed with the leadership, and changed their names to "Hong" (Red), "Wei" (Guard), and "Bing" (Soldier). They said, "We changed our names to 'Red,' 'Guard,' and 'Soldier' to remember the teachings of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, and the fighting friendship between us and the Red Guards, forever and ever to follow the great commander Chairman Mao in revolution."

Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Dianbing enlisted soon after the martyrdom of Comrades Li Wenzhong and others.

On September 22, the news of Li Wenzhong's martyrdom reached Li Jia Dui in Shandong Province, Wei County, Gouxigong. That evening, the eight members of Li Wenzhong's family gathered around a lamp to study Chairman Mao's works. Li Wenzhong's father, Li Huifeng, led everyone in reading a passage from Chairman Mao: "'A man may die, but his cause will live on. To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai; to work for the fascists and die for the exploiters is lighter than a feather.' To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai;..." Then, Li Wenzhong's mother, moved, said, "Wenzhong sacrificed himself to rescue the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. As Chairman Mao taught, he died a worthy and glorious death. Our whole family should learn from Wenzhong." Li Wenzhong's younger brother, Li Wenxiao, said, "Mother, you study Chairman Mao's works better than me. Our brother has sacrificed himself, and I will take over his mission!"

Around the same time, the personal belongings of martyr Li Congquan were sent to Jinji Temple Dui in Zhangdian Gong, Liu'an County, Anhui Province. Li Congquan's father, Li Dengting, looked at his son's belongings and thought of Chairman Mao's latest directive, "Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," and decided to send his eldest son, Li Congyi, to enlist. Li Dengting had only two sons, and the leaders and the masses all advised him to keep his eldest son at home to take care of him. He said, "Taking care of me is for personal gain, while enlisting is for the public good. We must break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness!" The father spoke the son's heart, and Li Congyi happily prepared to leave. Li Dengting then gave his eldest son the military uniform, cotton clothes, and quilt that the army had sent back, saying, "These things were given to your brother by the state and the people, and they are not worn out. Take them back to the army to use."

Around the same time, the moving story of Chen Diankui's self-sacrifice to rescue the Red Guards reached his hometown of Zhao Jia He Nan Village, Jiao Guan Gong, Changle County, Shandong Province, greatly educating his brothers, who all wanted to enlist to take over their brother's mission. Chen Diankui's father, Chen Guangming, discussed with his wife and decided to send their fourth son, Chen Dianjia, to take over his second son's gun. Before leaving, Chen Dianjia asked his mother for any instructions, and his mother told him, "Don't worry about home. In the army, your second brother is the example. Follow his example!"

Thus, the brothers of martyrs Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Diankui, carrying the instructions of their families, joined the ranks of the great People's Liberation Army of China. On the day they arrived at the "Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Platoon, the comrades of the Fourth Platoon, who had established immortal merits with Li Wenzhong and others in supporting the left, wore new uniforms, held red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and gave the warmest welcome to the new comrades. The entire platoon, old and new comrades together, walked to the portrait of Chairman Mao and sang "The East Is Red" loudly. The next day, the entire platoon gave the three new comrades the precious book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that Li Wenzhong and others had read. Platoon Leader Pang Chaosheng earnestly encouraged them, saying, "These were taken from the pockets of the martyrs after their sacrifice. They studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought at all times. I hope you will also, like them, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide every second of your life." The three new soldiers, with immense excitement, took the precious book with both hands, and countless words condensed into one sentence:

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long, long live!"

　　走英雄的路　接革命的班
　　——记“支左爱民模范”李文忠等烈士的兄弟入伍
    荣获伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，授予“支左爱民模范”称号的李文忠同志，以及李从全、陈佃奎同志，为抢救毛主席的红卫兵光荣牺牲后，有三名新战士最近来到了烈士生前所在的人民解放军六○一一部队某部六连四排，成为“支左爱民模范排”的光荣战士。
    这三名新战士，就是烈士李文忠的弟弟李文红，李从全的哥哥李从卫，陈佃奎的弟弟陈佃兵。他们的原名是李文孝、李从益、陈佃甲。为了学习亲人无限热爱毛主席的红卫兵的革命品质，他们来到部队，经过商量和领导机关批准，把自己名字中的“孝”“益”“甲”，改成为“红”“卫”“兵”。他们说：“我们改名为‘红’‘卫’‘兵’，是要把毛主席的教导、红卫兵小将的革命精神和俺兄弟与红卫兵的战斗友谊，牢牢记在心里，永远永远紧跟伟大统帅毛主席干革命。”
    李文红、李从卫和陈佃兵，是在李文忠等同志光荣牺牲后不久请求入伍的。
    九月二十二日，李文忠同志牺牲的消息传到山东潍县沟西公社李家大队。当晚，李文忠家里的八口人，围坐灯下，开了学习毛主席著作讲用会。李文忠的父亲李会丰领着大家朗读毛主席的一段语录：“‘人固有一死，或重于泰山，或轻于鸿毛。’为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；……”接着，李文忠的母亲激动地说：“文忠是为了抢救无产阶级革命派，为了保卫毛主席的革命路线牺牲的。就象毛主席教导的那样，他死得值得，死得光荣。我们全家都要向文忠学习。”李文忠的二弟李文孝说：“娘，你学毛主席著作比俺学得好。俺哥哥牺牲了，俺要去接他的班！”
    就在这几天，烈士李从全的遗物送到了安徽省六安县张店公社金氏祠大队。李从全的父亲李登庭，看看儿子遗下的东西，想起了毛主席“要斗私，批修”的最新指示，毅然决定送他大儿子李从益参军。李登庭只有两个儿子，领导和群众都劝他把大儿子留下照顾自己。他说：“照顾我是为私，去参军是为公。要破私立公啊！”父亲说出了儿子的心里话，李从益高兴地立即准备行装。李登庭又把部队刚送回来的李从全的军装、棉衣、棉被等交给大儿子，说：“这些东西都是国家和人民发给你弟弟的，还没穿坏，你再带回部队去用。”
    也在这几天，陈佃奎舍身抢救红卫兵的动人事迹，传到了他的家乡山东昌乐县乔官公社赵家河南村，使他的兄弟们受到了极大的教育，他们争着要去参军，接兄弟的班。陈佃奎的父亲陈光明和老伴商量后，决定由四儿子陈佃甲去接二儿子陈佃奎的枪。陈佃甲行前，问他母亲有什么嘱咐，他母亲告诉他：“别挂心家里，到了部队，你二哥就是样子，照着他的样子干！”
    就这样，李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎三位烈士的哥哥和弟弟，带着亲人的嘱托，走进了伟大中国人民解放军的行列。他们来到“支左爱民模范排”的那天，曾经和李文忠等烈士一起在支左工作中建立了不朽功勋的四排同志们，穿上了新军装，拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，最热烈地欢迎新战友的到来。全排新老同志一起，走到毛主席像前，放声高歌《东方红》。第二天，全排同志又把李文忠等烈士生前读过的宝书《毛主席语录》，授给了三位新战友。排长庞朝胜语重心长地勉励他们说：这是烈士牺牲后从他们的衣服口袋里拿出来的。他们生前时时学习、处处运用毛泽东思想，希望你们也象他们那样，用毛泽东思想统帅自己生命的每一秒钟。三位新战士以无比激动的心情，双手捧过宝书，千言万语凝结成一句话：
    “毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
