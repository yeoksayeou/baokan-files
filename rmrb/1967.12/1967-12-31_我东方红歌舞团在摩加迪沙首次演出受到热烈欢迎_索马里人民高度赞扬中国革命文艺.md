The Chinese "Red East" Song and Dance Troupe held its first performance in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, on the evening of the 21st at the newly built Somali National Theatre. Over a thousand people from various sectors of Somalia watched the revolutionary art performance from China and expressed their enthusiastic welcome and high praise.

Among the audience were Sheikh Mukhtar Muhammad Hussein, Speaker of the Somali National Assembly, the wife of Somali President Sharmarke, various ministers, deputies, and diplomats from other countries. The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy, Zheng Peitang, also attended.

At the opening ceremony, Muhammad Hashi, Director of the National Theatre, delivered a speech, warmly welcoming the visit and performance by Chinese artists.

He once again expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government for donating the Somali National Theatre as a gift. He said, "This is a symbol of friendship."

The leader of the "Red East" Song and Dance Troupe gave a reply, thanking the Somali government for its cordial invitation to the Chinese artists. He said: The "Red East" Song and Dance Troupe's visit to Somalia not only brings Chinese revolutionary songs and dances but, more importantly, also brings the warm greetings and profound respect of 700 million Chinese people to the Somali people. He expressed the hope that through this visit and performance, mutual understanding, friendship, and cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Somalia will be further promoted.

During the performance by the "Red East" Song and Dance Troupe, the Somali audience fully demonstrated their boundless love for the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao. Every time the brilliant image of Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, and every time the announcer reported a program praising Chairman Mao, mentioning Chairman Mao's name, the audience would erupt in thunderous applause that lasted for a long time.

The Chinese artists' performance of Somali songs was also warmly welcomed by the audience. They repeatedly requested encores, each time clapping in rhythm and singing along with the stage.

After the performance, Sheikh Mukhtar, the Speaker of the National Assembly, accompanied by the leader of the song and dance troupe and the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy, walked onto the stage, shook hands with each of the Chinese artists, and took a group photo with them.

The revolutionary art of China won the praise of friends from various sectors of Somalia. One Somali friend said: "We have seen the new art that has appeared on the stage in China after the Cultural Revolution. We have seen the image of the Red Guards." Another Somali friend said: "The Cultural Revolution has brought about tremendous changes in China. The world will see more clearly the great significance of this revolution."

    索马里人民高度赞扬中国革命文艺
    据新华社摩加迪沙电　中国东方红歌舞团二十一日晚在索马里首都摩加迪沙新落成的索马里国家剧院举行首次演出。索马里各界人士一千多人观看了中国的革命文艺演出，并表示热烈欢迎与高度赞赏。
    观看演出的有索马里国民议会议长谢赫·穆克塔尔·穆罕默德·侯赛因，索马里总统舍马克的夫人，各部部长，议员和各国外交使节。中国大使馆临时代办郑佩堂也陪同观看。
    在开幕式上，国家剧院院长穆罕默德·哈希致词，热烈欢迎中国艺术工作者的访问演出。
    他再次表示感谢中国政府把索马里国家剧院作为礼物赠给索马里。他说，“这是友谊的象征。”
    中国东方红歌舞团团长致答词，感谢索马里政府对中国艺术工作者的盛情邀请。他说：中国歌舞团来索马里访问演出不仅带来了中国的革命歌舞，更重要的是，还带来七亿中国人民对索马里人民的热情问候和崇高敬意。他表示希望通过这次访问演出进一步促进中索两国人民的相互了解、友谊和文化交流。
    索马里观众在观看东方红歌舞团演出的过程中，充分表现了他们对世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无限敬爱，每当光辉灿烂的毛主席像出现在天幕上的时候，每当报幕员报告一个颂扬毛主席的节目，提到毛主席的名字的时候，观众就发出经久不息的雷鸣般的掌声。
    中国艺术工作者演唱的索马里歌曲也受到观众们热烈的欢迎。他们一再要求再唱，每次都一面按节奏拍手，一面同舞台上一起歌唱。
    演出结束后，国民议会议长谢赫·穆克塔尔在歌舞团团长和中国大使馆临时代办的陪同下走上舞台，同中国艺术工作者一一握手，并同他们一起照了相。
    中国的革命艺术博得了索马里各界朋友的好评。一位索马里朋友说：“我们看到了中国开展文化大革命以后出现在舞台上的新艺术。我们看到了红卫兵的形象。”另外一位索马里朋友说：“文化大革命使中国发生了巨大的变化。全世界将更清楚地看到这场大革命的重大意义。”
