We are filled with revolutionary fervor as we repeatedly study the exemplary experiences of the 834 Division in supporting the left at the Beijing Knitting Factory. We have received profound education.

The comrades from the 834 Division, with their deep class feelings of boundless loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, have vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought in their leftist support work. They have conducted in-depth, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work, bringing the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to the workshops, dormitories, and the hearts of every worker and their families, creating a great revolutionary situation in the factory. Their noble qualities of being close to the masses and serving the people wholeheartedly have set a shining example for us.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles." In the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, we have gradually come to understand that although leftist support work is complex and ever-changing, grasping ideological and political work is fundamental. Only by adhering to political leadership, doing people's work, and arming the broad masses with the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought can we make them firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployments, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. Our heroic platoon leader Li Wenzhong, before his passing, always told us to actively do mass work and solve problems by starting with ideological work. Whether in supporting agriculture or industry, he insisted on doing in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work, letting Mao Zedong Thought take root in the hearts of the masses. Sometimes, to educate someone burdened with ideological baggage, he would stay up all night, talking to that person again and again until the ideological problem was resolved. Therefore, many people praised him as a confidant of the masses. Under the guidance of Comrade Li Wenzhong, our platoon has always put ideological and political work in the first place, but compared to the comrades of the 834 Division, we still have a long way to go.

The 834 Division on the leftist support front is a red flag for the entire army and a good example for us to learn from. We believe that the most fundamental thing is to learn from their spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is a people's army. It fights for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly for the interests of the people." Now, we are supporting the left in the factory. We are determined to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" as the key link, learn from the 834 Division, go deep into the masses, blend in with the masses, and wholeheartedly and persistently do good ideological and political work for the masses. Let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought take root in the hearts of the broad masses, grasp the revolution, promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

### 向支左红旗八三四一部队学习

　　向支左红旗八三四一部队学习
　　六○一一部队某部六连“支左爱民模范排”
    我们满怀革命激情反复学习了八三四一部队在北京针织总厂支左的典型经验，受到了深刻的教育。
    八三四一部队支左同志，以无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，在支左工作中大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，把光焰无际的毛泽东思想送到车间，送到宿舍，送到每个职工及其家属的心坎里，使这个厂出现了一片大好的革命形势。他们这种密切联系群众，全心全意为人民服务的高贵品质，为我们树立了光辉的榜样。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”在“三支”“两军”工作中，我们逐步地体会到：支左工作尽管千头万绪，情况千变万化，但是，抓好思想政治工作是根本。只有坚持政治挂帅，做好人的工作，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想去武装广大群众的头脑，才能使他们坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线上，紧跟毛主席的战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。我们的英雄排长李文忠同志，生前随时告诉我们，要积极做好群众工作，解决问题要从思想工作入手。无论在支农或支工的工作中，他坚持做深入细致的思想政治工作，让毛泽东思想在群众心里扎根。有时他为了教育好一个背着思想包袱的人，废寝忘食地一次又一次地去和那人谈心，直至解决思想问题为止。因此，许多人都称赞他是群众的知心人。我们排在李文忠同志带动下，虽然坚持把思想政治工作放在第一位，但比起八三四一部队同志来，还差得很远很远。
    八三四一部队在支左战线上，是全军的一面红旗，是我们学习的好榜样。我们认为，最根本的是要学习他们全心全意为人民服务的思想。毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”现在，我们在工厂支左，决心活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以八三四一部队为榜样，深入到群众中去，和群众打成一片，满腔热忱地、坚持不懈地做好群众思想政治工作，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想在广大群众心里扎根，抓好革命，促好生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
