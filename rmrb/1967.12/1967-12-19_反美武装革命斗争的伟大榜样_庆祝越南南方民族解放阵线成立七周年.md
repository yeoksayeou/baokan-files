Tomorrow marks the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the glorious banner bearer of the South Vietnamese people. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the South Vietnamese people on this brilliant fighting holiday and celebrate the great victories they have achieved in the war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation!

Born in the flames of the struggle against the U.S., the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam has raised the banner of resistance against U.S. aggression and national salvation, uniting the broadest masses of people from all strata of South Vietnamese society. They have engaged in arduous and relentless battles against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, fully demonstrating the power of people's war, and setting a great example of armed revolutionary struggle against the U.S. for all the peoples of the world.

Over the past seven years, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people have grown stronger and more courageous with each battle. They have developed from small guerrilla units into a powerful people's army comprising the Liberation Army, local forces, and guerrillas. They have creatively applied the strategies and tactics of people's war, firmly seizing the initiative on the battlefield, and foiling the enemy's repeated attempts to escalate the war. They have annihilated more than a million enemy troops, including over 250,000 U.S. aggressors and their mercenaries. The U.S. aggressors are sinking deeper and deeper into the sea of people's war and are facing imminent doom.

While the South Vietnamese people are bravely resisting the U.S. aggressors, the military and civilian population of North Vietnam have also achieved the glorious feat of shooting down more than 2,600 U.S. aircraft.

The great victories of the Vietnamese people in their war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation have thoroughly exposed the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism. In the Vietnam War, U.S. imperialism has deployed nearly half of its ground troops, nearly a fifth of its air force, and more than a quarter of its navy. It has used all modern weapons except the atomic bomb, and its military expenditure has reached the astronomical figure of $300 billion per year. Yet, it has been defeated and is now at its wits' end. The myth of the "invincibility" of U.S. imperialism has once again been proven false.

The great victories of the Vietnamese people in their war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation have significantly weakened and tied down the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism, disrupted the counter-revolutionary global strategy of U.S. imperialism, and powerfully supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. They have made a great contribution to the revolutionary cause of the contemporary world.

The great victories of the Vietnamese people in their war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation have created a brilliant example of a single country resisting and defeating U.S. imperialist aggression since the end of World War II. It has powerfully proven that relying on the people, persisting in armed struggle, and using revolutionary war to counter counter-revolutionary war is the only path for oppressed nations and peoples to achieve complete liberation.

In the issue of supporting the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, there has always been a struggle between two lines. The revolutionary peoples of the world regard the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle and resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end, driving the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam. However, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has attempted to bring the Vietnamese issue into the track of Soviet-U.S. cooperation, using the counter-revolutionary two-faced tactic of fake support and real betrayal. They have actively helped U.S. imperialism peddle the "peace talks" fraud, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. This fully exposes the Soviet revisionist leadership clique as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism and a shameful traitor to the revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world.

Currently, the Johnson administration, in close collaboration with the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, is desperately struggling to salvage its defeat in the Vietnam War. On the one hand, it is hastening to plot new military adventures, even planning to expand the war to Laos and Cambodia. On the other hand, it continues to push the "bombing to force peace" and "stop bombing to lure peace" conspiracies and attempts to use the United Nations to interfere in the Vietnamese issue. However, all these efforts are in vain.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared: "The Vietnamese people will resolutely fight until there is not a single U.S. aggressor on their beloved land." The political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam clearly states: As long as U.S. imperialism does not withdraw all its troops and puppet troops from Vietnam, the Vietnamese people will resolutely fight to the end. This fully expresses the iron will of the 31 million Vietnamese people to unite and resist the U.S. We are firmly convinced that the Vietnamese people, by persisting in the protracted struggle, will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors and complete the great cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and reunifying the country.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will surely deliver a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world. The great victories of the Vietnamese people in their war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation are a powerful proof of this. The proletariat and working people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are awakening anew. U.S. imperialism and all other harmful elements have prepared their own gravediggers, and their days of being buried will not be long."

The Chinese people, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation as our internationalist duty. The great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has given the Chinese people more strength to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese brothers. The 700 million Chinese people will forever be the strong rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China will forever be the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will unswervingly support the heroic Vietnamese people and drive the U.S. aggressor bandits out of the sacred land of Vietnam, not leaving a single one behind!

　　反美武装革命斗争的伟大榜样
　　——庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年
    明天是越南南方人民的光荣旗手——越南南方民族解放阵线成立的七周年。中国人民热烈祝贺越南南方人民的这个光辉的战斗节日，欢呼越南南方人民在抗美救国战争中所取得的伟大胜利！
    在反美斗争烈火中诞生的越南南方民族解放阵线，高举抗美救国的伟大旗帜，把越南南方各阶层人民最广泛地团结在自己的周围，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行了艰苦卓绝的战斗，极大地发挥了人民战争的威力，为全世界人民树立了反美武装革命斗争的伟大榜样。
    七年来，在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，越南南方人民武装力量越战越勇，越战越强，已经由小小的游击队发展成为一支包括解放军、地方武装和游击队的强大的人民军队。他们创造性地运用人民战争的战略战术，牢牢掌握战场上的主动权，粉碎了敌人一次又一次的战争“升级”，歼灭了敌人有生力量一百多万人，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军二十五万人以上。美国侵略者在人民战争的汪洋大海中越陷越深，正面临灭顶之灾。
    在越南南方人民英勇抗击美国侵略者的同时，越南北方军民也取得了击落美国飞机两千六百多架的辉煌战果。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，彻底戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎的虚弱本质。在侵越战争中，美帝国主义投入了它的近二分之一的地面部队，动用了它的近五分之一的空军和四分之一以上的海军，使用了原子弹以外的一切现代化武器，耗费的军费已经达到一年三百亿美元的巨大数字。但结果却被打得一败涂地，走投无路。所谓美帝国主义“不可战胜”的神话又一次宣告破产。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，大大削弱和牵制了美帝国主义的侵略力量，打乱了美帝国主义反革命全球战略的部署，有力地支援了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的革命斗争，为当代世界革命事业作出了伟大的贡献。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，创造了第二次世界大战以后一个国家单独抗击和战胜美帝国主义侵略的光辉典范。它雄辩地证明，依靠人民，坚持武装斗争，用革命战争反对反革命战争，是被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取彻底解放的唯一道路。
    在对待越南人民抗美救国战争的问题上，一直存在着两条路线的斗争。世界革命人民把越南人民的斗争看作自己的斗争，坚决支持越南人民打到底，把美国侵略者赶出越南。而苏修领导集团却力图把越南问题纳入苏美合作的轨道，使用假支持、真出卖的反革命两面手法，积极帮助美帝国主义推销“和谈”骗局，妄想扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争的革命烈火。这就充分暴露了苏修领导集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是世界人民革命事业的可耻叛徒。
    目前，约翰逊政府为挽救它在侵越战争中的败局，正在苏修领导集团的密切配合下，进行疯狂的挣扎。它一方面加紧策划新的军事冒险，甚至打算把战争扩大到老挝和柬埔寨；一方面又继续大搞“以炸迫和”和“停炸诱和”的阴谋，并且企图利用联合国插手越南问题。但是，所有这一切，都是徒劳的。
    胡志明主席庄严宣布：“越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。”越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领明确指出：只要美帝国主义没有把它的美国军队和所有仆从军队全部撤离越南，越南人民就坚决战斗到彻底胜利。这充分表达了三千一百万越南人民团结抗美的钢铁意志。我们深信，越南人民坚持打下去，持久抗战，就一定能够彻底打败美国侵略者，完成解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的伟大事业。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，就是一个有力的证明。欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”
    中国人民遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一贯把支援越南人民的抗美救国战争当作自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，使中国人民更有力量支援越南兄弟的正义斗争。七亿中国人民永远是越南人民的坚强后盾，中国辽阔的国土永远是越南人民的可靠后方。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，将始终不渝地支援英雄的越南人民，把美国侵略强盗一个不剩地从越南神圣的土地上赶出去！
