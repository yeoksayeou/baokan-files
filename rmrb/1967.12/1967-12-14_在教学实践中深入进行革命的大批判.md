Title: Deepening the Revolutionary Criticism in Teaching Practice

In teaching practice, we must deepen the revolutionary criticism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our current important task on the ideological front is to launch a criticism of revisionism."

To resume classes and make revolution, we must take "criticize revisionism and repudiate oneself" as the guiding principle, and carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism on the educational front. This is an important link in the educational revolution.

To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must establish and innovate, but we must start from destruction, from criticism. As pointed out in the November 26 editorial of the People's Daily, "Resuming classes and making revolution" means teaching and learning through criticism; it means destruction first, and establishment in the process. This means that in teaching practice, we must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents on the educational front, and thoroughly criticize the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. Only on the basis of deep criticism can we thoroughly eliminate the old educational system of "feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism," and firmly establish the proletarian educational system in politics, ideology, and theory, and effectively prevent the restoration of the old educational system.

The experience of resuming classes and making revolution tells us that the revolutionary criticism on the educational front can only be carried out broadly and deeply in teaching practice. While carrying out teaching practice, we must also carry out revolutionary criticism; while destroying the old, we must also innovate, and implement Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts, gradually proposing revolutionary plans for teaching systems and content. This is the correct approach in line with Mao Zedong Thought. The idea that revolutionary criticism can be carried out well and the educational revolution can be carried out thoroughly without participating in teaching practice is detached from reality and unworkable.

As Chairman Mao pointed out: "If one wants to directly recognize some or certain things, one must participate in the practical struggle to change reality, to change some or certain things, to touch the phenomena of those things, and only in the practical struggle to change reality can one expose the essence of those things and understand them." Some comrades think that they have practiced for more than ten years under the old educational system, and now they can carry out revolutionary criticism without resuming classes and without conducting teaching practice. These comrades have not seen that today's teaching practice is no longer the passive practice of blindly accepting bourgeois education in the past, but the practice of changing reality. This is the conscious revolutionary practice of the broad revolutionary teachers and students who have been tempered by more than a year of the proletarian cultural revolution under the guidance of Chairman Mao's educational revolutionary thoughts, and the practice of creating a new educational system. Through this practice, the reactionary essence of the old educational system can be more fully and thoroughly exposed and criticized at its core. This teaching practice cannot be replaced by the teaching practice of the past.

The revisionist educational line is embodied in a whole set of old educational systems, old teaching content, and old teaching methods, permeating every aspect of school teaching practice. Chairman Mao pointed out: "We who are engaged in the Chinese revolution not only need to understand the particularity of the contradictions in their totality, that is, the interconnection of contradictions, but also only by studying from the various aspects of contradictions can we understand their totality." Therefore, we must not only thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line advocated by China's Khrushchev in its entirety, but also carry out this criticism into every aspect of teaching practice, and deeply into the criticism of various old teaching systems, old teaching content, and old teaching methods in schools. The idea of wanting to overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in its entirety without seriously studying and criticizing these specific aspects is extremely unrealistic.

Similarly, the practice of not wanting to do hard work in teaching practice, merely shouting slogans like "completely smash" and "thoroughly crush," without distinguishing right from wrong, and indiscriminately negating and canceling everything, will not achieve the goal of educational revolution, nor will it touch the essence of the old educational system. Lenin once sharply pointed out: "The characteristic of petty-bourgeois revolutionaries is that they do not know that the means of overthrowing, smashing, etc., are not enough for socialism,—only the crazed small proprietors who oppose the big proprietors think this is enough,—but proletarian revolutionaries, at any time, will not make this mistake."

To carry out the revolutionary criticism on the educational front and fundamentally end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools, we must firmly grasp the correct direction of the revolutionary struggle. We must strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions and distinguish between general bourgeois worldview issues and reactionary political stance issues. We must not regard revolutionary teachers and cadres whose bourgeois worldviews have not yet been transformed as targets of criticism and struggle.

Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles on educational revolution are the great program for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution and the most powerful ideological weapon for deepening the revolutionary criticism in teaching practice. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize the broad masses of teachers and students, and thoroughly study and implement Chairman Mao's series of great instructions on the proletarian educational revolution, ensuring that every instruction is implemented and every word is followed.

Believing in the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, believing in the great power of the masses, and believing in the collective revolutionary wisdom, we will surely create unprecedented miracles in human history and achieve great victories in the proletarian educational revolution.

　　在教学实践中深入进行革命的大批判
　　任立新
　　进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
　　毛泽东
    毛主席教导我们：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”
    复课闹革命，必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，在教育战线上深入展开一场革命的大批判。这是教育革命的重要环节。
    进行无产阶级教育革命，要立，要创新，但是，一定要从破入手，从大批判入手。正如《人民日报》十一月二十六日社论《再论大中小学校都要复课闹革命》中所指出的：“复课闹革命，是在批判中教，批判中学；是破字当头，立在其中。”这就是说，要在教学实践中，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育战线的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”。只有在进行深刻批判的基础上，才能彻底地破除“封、资、修”的旧教育制度，才能从政治上、思想上、理论上牢固地确立无产阶级教育制度，并且有效地防止旧教育制度的复辟。
    复课闹革命的经验告诉我们，教育战线上的革命大批判，只有在教学实践中，才能广泛、深入地进行下去。一边进行教学实践，一边进行革命的大批判；一边破旧，一边创新，贯彻实行毛主席的教育革命思想，逐步提出教学制度和教学内容的革命方案，这才是符合毛泽东思想的正确做法。那种认为不参加教学实践，就能把革命大批判搞好，就能把教育革命进行到底的想法，是脱离实际的，是行不通的。
    正如毛主席所指出：“如果要直接地认识某种或某些事物，便只有亲身参加于变革现实、变革某种或某些事物的实践的斗争中，才能触到那种或那些事物的现象，也只有在亲身参加变革现实的实践的斗争中，才能暴露那种或那些事物的本质而理解它们。”有的同志认为，在旧教育制度下已经实践了十几年，现在搞革命的大批判，不用复课，不用再进行教学实践了。这些同志没有看到，今天的教学实践，已经不同于过去那种被动地接受资产阶级教育的盲目实践，而是变革现实的实践。这是经过一年多无产阶级文化大革命风暴锻炼的广大革命师生，在毛主席的教育革命思想指引下，自觉的革命实践，创建新教育制度的实践。通过这种实践，才能更充分、更彻底地暴露旧教育制度的反动本质，予以击中要害的批判。这种教学实践是过去那种教学实践所不能代替的。
    修正主义的教育路线，是通过一整套旧的教育制度、旧的教学内容和旧的教学方法来体现的，贯穿在学校教学实践活动的每一个环节中。毛主席指出：“我们从事中国革命的人，不但要在各个矛盾的总体上，即矛盾的相互联结上，了解其特殊性，而且只有从矛盾的各个方面着手研究，才有可能了解其总体。”因此，我们不仅要从总体上彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，而且，要把这个批判深入到教学实践的每一个环节中去，深入到对学校里各种旧的教学制度、旧的教学内容和旧的教学方法的批判中去。那种企图不通过对这些具体方面的认真研究和批判，就想从总体上一举摧垮反革命修正主义教育路线，轻易地得到伟大成功的想法，是极不现实的。
    同样，那种不愿在教学实践中做艰苦工作，空喊什么“完全粉碎”、“彻底砸烂”，不分青红皂白，一概否定、一概取消的做法，是根本不可能达到教育革命的目的，也不可能从本质上触动旧的教育制度的。列宁曾尖锐地指出：“小资产阶级革命家的特点就是不知道打倒、粉碎等等手段对于社会主义是不够的，——只有疯狂反对大私有者的小私有者，才认为这就够了，——但是无产阶级革命家，无论什么时候都不会犯这种错误。”
    开展教育战线上革命的大批判，从根本上结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，必须牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向。要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，要把一般的资产阶级世界观问题和反动的政治立场问题区分开来。决不能把资产阶级世界观还没有改造好的革命教员和革命干部，当作批判斗争的对象。
    毛主席关于教育革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，是进行无产阶级教育革命的伟大纲领，是在教学实践中深入进行革命大批判的最强大的思想武器。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，放手发动广大师生员工，大学大用毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的一系列伟大指示，做到条条落实，句句照办。
    坚信毛泽东思想的无穷威力，坚信群众的伟大力量，坚信集体的革命智慧，我们必将创造出人类历史上的空前奇迹，必将赢得无产阶级教育革命的伟大胜利。
