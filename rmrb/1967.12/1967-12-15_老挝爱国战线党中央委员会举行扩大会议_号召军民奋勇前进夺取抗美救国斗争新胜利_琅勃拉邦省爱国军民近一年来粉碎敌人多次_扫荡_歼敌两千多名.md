The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front held an enlarged meeting from December 3 to 9. The meeting called on the Lao patriotic army and people to unite closely, forge ahead, and achieve new victories in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

Attending the meeting were: Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, Vice-Chairmen Phoumi Vongvichit and Kaysone Phomvihane, members of the Central Committee, representatives from various departments and agencies, and many other patriotic figures.

Kaysone Phomvihane, Minister of Health and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao Three-Party National United Front Government, Colonel Dong, Commander-in-Chief of the Patriotic Neutralist Forces, and many other leading figures and patriots also attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Prince Souphanouvong delivered a report titled "On the New Situation and Tasks." The report analyzed the situation between the enemy and ourselves and the changes in the Lao situation. It also pointed out the new direction and tasks for the Lao patriotic army and people in their struggle against the enemy's new plots, for the sake of the country and the people's new victories.

The meeting unanimously adopted Prince Souphanouvong's report and expressed its determination to defeat the U.S. aggressors and their Lao lackeys, and to advance the country on the path of peace, independence, neutrality, unity, and prosperity.

The meeting called on the patriotic army and people to unite closely, actively complete new tasks, strengthen revolutionary forces, and achieve new victories in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and for national salvation.

The heroic patriotic army and people of Laos' Luang Prabang Province, from last December to this October, over the past year, have smashed the enemy's repeated "sweeping" and "gobbling" operations, achieving extremely brilliant results.

According to incomplete statistics, the army and people of Luang Prabang Province, during the above period, annihilated more than 2,500 enemy troops, destroyed five enemy command posts, shot down or damaged 28 enemy aircraft, damaged six enemy aircraft, sank 18 enemy motorboats and patrol boats, and seized a large amount of military supplies.

The General Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, on November 20, sent a telegram to the guerrilla forces of Savannakhet Province, warmly praising their brilliant achievements of shooting down two U.S. helicopters with light weapons on October 30 and November 4.

The telegram said: Recently, U.S. imperialism has increased the use of helicopters to airlift U.S. troops and South Vietnamese special forces into the liberated areas of central and southern Laos, in order to achieve its evil purpose of destroying the liberated areas. At the same time, it is preparing conditions for sending U.S. ground troops to occupy central and southern Laos regions. Therefore, the Lao patriotic army and people must further heighten their vigilance and take all measures to annihilate all invading enemies.
