The U.S. recently forced some Western European countries to provide gold to support the dollar at a meeting of central bank governors from seven Western capitalist countries. However, this conspiracy encountered resistance from Western European countries. Meanwhile, due to France revealing the details of the meeting, the U.S.'s predicament was exposed, leading to another gold-buying frenzy in the Western financial markets, which shook the already shaky position of the dollar.

After the devaluation of the pound, a fierce gold-buying frenzy erupted in the capitalist world. People feared that the dollar would follow suit and devalue, leading to a massive dumping of dollars and a rush to buy gold. According to U.S. officials, in November alone, the U.S. lost $475 million in gold. As a result, U.S. gold reserves were reduced to $1,243.4 million, far from covering its foreign debts. The terrified U.S. authorities felt that if they did not rally Western European countries to help support the dollar and allow the gold-buying frenzy to continue, their increasingly depleted gold reserves would not withstand a few major shocks.

According to French media reports, at the meeting of the "International Gold Pool" member countries (the UK, West Germany, Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the U.S.) held in Basel, Switzerland, from December 8 to 11, the U.S. demanded that Western European countries hand over part of their gold reserves to the U.S. in exchange for U.S. bonds to help the U.S. replenish its severely depleted gold reserves.

The U.S. has always adopted self-serving and crisis-shifting tactics in the monetary and financial fields against other capitalist countries. By controlling the "International Monetary Fund," the U.S. has forced other countries to pool gold shares for medium or short-term loans to support the privileged positions of the dollar and the pound. The U.S. also controls the "International Gold Pool," coercing participating countries to provide gold to help the U.S. cope with the gold-buying frenzy in the capitalist world's financial markets and maintain the dollar's exchange rate with gold. Now, the U.S. is blatantly attempting to seize other countries' gold reserves with worthless "bonds," naturally provoking opposition from these countries. It is reported that, except for the UK, which is on the same sinking ship as the U.S., other Western European countries reacted very coldly to the U.S.'s demand, especially Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, which explicitly refused. Even British newspapers had to admit that the U.S. plan "faced significant resistance."

It is reported that the U.S. also proposed another suggestion in Basel, demanding to divide the existing gold market in the capitalist world into three categories to help the U.S. stop gold speculation, reduce the impact of gold markets on the dollar, and partially open up a path for gold price increases in the financial market to attract gold-producing countries to supply gold, thereby easing the pressure on the dollar. However, the participating countries did not express agreement with this proposal, which is beneficial to the dollar's inflation.

France, which has always advocated abolishing the dollar's privileged position and demanding an increase in the gold-to-dollar exchange rate (i.e., devaluation of the dollar), not only did not participate in the discussion this time and ignored the U.S.'s demands but also the semi-official French newspaper "Le Monde" first detailed the content of the U.S. plan and listed reasons to express serious doubts about the effectiveness of these measures.

The U.S.'s plans failed, but its desperate attempts to rescue the dollar further exposed the dollar's weakness, sparking a new gold-buying frenzy in the capitalist world's financial markets. In recent days, the amount of gold purchased in the London and Paris markets has significantly increased. Especially on December 12, after the news of the U.S. plan's failure spread, 8 tons of gold were bought in the Paris market in one day, almost four times the trading volume of December 11.

### 美国强使西欧国家拿出黄金支撑美元阴谋破产　西方抢购黄金的风潮冲击摇摇欲坠的美元地位

　　美国强使西欧国家拿出黄金支撑美元阴谋破产
　　西方抢购黄金的风潮冲击摇摇欲坠的美元地位
    新华社巴黎电　美国最近在七个西方资本主义国家的中央银行行长会议上强使一些西欧国家拿出黄金来支撑美元，但是这一阴谋遭到了西欧国家的抵制。同时，由于法国透露了会议的情况，暴露了美国的窘境，使得西方金融市场上再一次发生抢购黄金的风潮，冲击了摇摇欲坠的美元地位。
    在英镑贬值以后，资本主义世界爆发了猛烈的抢购黄金风潮。人们担心美元跟着贬值，大量抛出美元抢购黄金。据美国官方宣布，在十一月一个月中，美国流失黄金共达四亿七千五百万美元。这样，美国黄金储备只剩下一百二十四亿三千四百万美元，远远抵不上它在国外的债务。惊恐万状的美国当局感到，如果不设法纠集各西欧国家来帮助它支撑美元，听任抢购黄金风潮发展下去，它的越来越枯竭的黄金储备是经不起几次大冲击的。
    据法国报刊透露，在十二月八日到十一日在瑞士巴塞尔举行的“国际金库”成员国（英国、西德、瑞士、意大利、荷兰、比利时、美国）中央银行行长会议上，美国要西欧国家把它们的部分黄金储备交给美国，换取美国的债券，以帮助美国充实十分空虚的黄金储备。
    美国在货币金融领域里一贯对其他资本主义国家采取损人利己、转嫁危机的手段。美国一手控制
  “国际货币基金组织”，就曾迫使其他国家凑集黄金份额，作为中期或短期贷款，贷放给美国和英国来支持美元和英镑的特权地位；美国还控制“国际金库”，要挟参加国拿出黄金来帮助美国应付资本主义世界金融市场上抢购黄金的风潮，维持美元同黄金的比价。现在美国居然明目张胆地想用不值半文的“债券”，干脆把别国的黄金储备据为己有，自然要引起这些国家的反对。据透露，除了同美国同乘一条破船的英国以外，其他西欧国家对美国这一要求反应十分冷淡，特别是瑞士、比利时和荷兰，都明确表示拒绝。连英国报纸也不得不承认，美国的计划“遭到很大的抵制”。
    据透露，美国在巴塞尔还提出另一个建议，要求把资本主义世界现有的黄金市场分成三种，以便于美国制止黄金投机，减少黄金市场上对美元的冲击，并且部分地为金融市场上黄金涨价开辟途径，以吸引产金国供应黄金，减轻美元所受的压力。但是，参加会议各国对这个有利于美元通货膨胀的建议，也没有表示同意。
    一贯主张取消美元特权地位和要求提高黄金对美元比价（即美元贬值）的法国，这一次不仅根本不参加讨论，对美国的要求不予理睬，而且接近官方的法国《世界报》还首先详细透露了美国方案的内容，并且列举理由对这些措施的效果表示严重怀疑。
    美国的打算落了空，而它那种不择手段地设法抢救美元的窘态却更加暴露了美元的虚弱，激起了资本主义世界金融市场上抢购黄金的新风潮。近几天来伦敦、巴黎市场上购买黄金的数量又大为增长。特别是在十二日美国计划遭到挫败的消息传出以后，巴黎市场上一天之内被抢购的黄金共达八吨，几乎等于十一日成交额的四倍。
