In the midst of the continuous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers on the salt industry front in our country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have been vigorously promoting revolution and vigorously promoting production, achieving remarkable results. By December 10, the national salt production had already completed the annual state plan 20 days ahead of schedule. Some units have also achieved significant results in the comprehensive utilization of salt resources. The main salt-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanghai, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang have generally increased salt production by 10% to over 50% compared to the state plan this year. The quality of salt production in various places has generally improved compared to last year. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad salt industry workers in the four northern coastal salt-producing areas of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu have emphasized proletarian politics, using every means to improve operational methods to adapt to weather changes in various periods. Many units have increased production compared to last year. The salt industry workers in inland lake, well, and mine salt-producing areas have also actively responded to Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," overcoming numerous difficulties, and striving to increase production and improve quality.

    据新华社讯　在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利声中，我国盐业战线上的广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，取得了比较显著的成绩。到十二月十日，全国盐的产量已经提前二十天胜利地完成了全年国家计划。盐业资源综合利用，有些单位也取得很大成绩。江苏、浙江、福建、广东、广西、上海、山西、内蒙古、青海、新疆等主要产盐区，今年盐的产量一般都比国家计划增产了百分之十到百分之五十以上。各地产盐质量普遍比去年有所提高。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    辽宁、河北、山东、江苏四个北方海盐区广大盐业职工突出无产阶级政治，千方百计地改进操作方法，以适应各个时期的天气变化，不少单位都比去年增产。内地湖、井、矿盐产区的盐业职工，也都积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，克服重重困难，努力做到增加产量和提高质量。
