With the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Latin America has become more extensive and profound. An increasing number of revolutionary people in Latin America are breaking through the numerous obstacles set by imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, and are more enthusiastically studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Last October, when the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries used all their propaganda machines to attack and slander the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the youth of Ecuador held their 22nd Representative Congress. At this time, Chinese student organizations sent a congratulatory telegram to their Ecuadorian comrades who were steadfast in their anti-imperialist struggle. This greatly encouraged the delegates, who stood up and applauded, shouting, "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!" "Long live the Red Guards!" In their return telegram to the Chinese students, the congress expressed resolute support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. University student Jorge Romero said, "The imperialists and revisionists are attacking China, which itself shows the great role and profound significance of Mao Zedong Thought in this revolutionary era."

The revolutionaries in Latin America are studying the works of Chairman Mao under the white terror of the reactionaries. The reactionaries are most afraid of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought and do everything possible to prevent Chairman Mao's books from reaching the hands of the revolutionaries, which also educates the revolutionary people from the opposite side. A trade union leader in Colombia said after being searched by the police, "The reactionaries searched and destroyed Chairman Mao's works, which shows that China's position is correct and is Marxist-Leninist, because Comrade Mao Zedong said that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." A student said, "Chairman Mao's teachings are already engraved in our hearts, which no one can search and take away!"

Modern revisionists are a bunch of pseudo-revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries who use the banner of "revolution." They are most afraid of the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought that exposes their true colors, and even fear hearing the glorious name of Mao Zedong. Recently, a revisionist leader in a South American country forced a branch named after Mao Zedong to change its name. However, the members of this branch have deep feelings for Chairman Mao and resolutely resisted this unreasonable demand. They said: Our branch has not changed its view of Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong is the great leader of the Chinese people and the helmsman of the world revolution.

Now, revolutionary organizations in some Latin American countries are organizing the study of Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as the highest principle of ideological construction, and using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and arm their members. A leader of the Argentine Communist Vanguard Party recently spoke about their organization, saying, "The study and application of Chairman Mao's works should become a regular activity of this organization. This is the main way to prevent the development of revisionism within our organization and to maintain a high level of vigilance against it forever." He expressed that the "Three Articles" should be studied first to solve the problem of worldview.

### 突破帝修反重重障碍，学习和运用毛泽东思想　毛主席的教导永远铭记在拉美革命人民心中

　　突破帝修反重重障碍，学习和运用毛泽东思想
　　毛主席的教导永远铭记在拉美革命人民心中
    随着中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，毛泽东思想在拉丁美洲的传播更为广泛和深入。越来越多的拉丁美洲革命人民，突破帝、修、反所设置的重重障碍，更加热情地学习和运用毛泽东思想。
    去年十月，当帝修反开动一切宣传机器对史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命横加攻击、诬蔑的时候，厄瓜多尔青年学生召开了他们的第二十二次代表大会。这时候，中国的学生组织给坚持反帝斗争的厄瓜多尔战友拍去了贺电。这使大会代表特别受到鼓舞，他们起立鼓掌，高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”“中国文化大革命万岁！”“红卫兵万岁！”大会在给中国学生的回电中表示坚决支持中国无产阶级文化大革命。大学生豪尔赫·罗梅罗说：“帝国主义和修正主义攻击的中心是中国，这本身就表明，在目前这个革命时代毛泽东思想所起的伟大作用和深远意义。”
    拉丁美洲革命者是在反动派的白色恐怖中学习毛主席的著作的。反动派最害怕光辉的毛泽东思想，千方百计地阻止毛主席的书传到革命者手里，这也从反面教育了革命人民。哥伦比亚一位工会领导人被警察搜查后说：“反动派搜查和毁坏了毛主席著作，这表明中国的立场是正确的，是马克思列宁主义的，因为毛泽东同志说，被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”一个学生说，毛主席的教导已经铭记在我们心里了，这是任何人都搜查不去的！
    现代修正主义者是一伙打着“革命”旗号的假革命、反革命，他们最害怕毛泽东思想这个照妖镜照出他们的原形，甚至害怕听到毛泽东这个光辉的名字。不久前，南美洲一个国家的修正主义头目强迫一个以毛泽东的名字命名的支部改换名称。但是，这个支部的成员对毛主席有深厚的感情，他们坚决抵制了这种无理要求。他们说：我们支部没有改变对毛泽东的看法。毛泽东是中国人民的伟大导师，是世界革命的舵手。
    现在，拉丁美洲一些国家的革命组织正在组织学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想作为思想建设的最高原则，用毛泽东思想教育和武装自己的成员。阿根廷共产主义先锋党的一位领导人最近谈到他们的组织时说：“活学活用毛泽东主席的著作应当成为这个组织的经常活动。这是防止在我们组织内发展修正主义并对它永远保持高度警惕的主要办法。”他表示，首先应当学习“老三篇”来解决世界观的问题。　（据新华社）（附图片）
    光辉的毛泽东思想给越南人民的抗美救国斗争以无穷的力量。图为站在反美斗争最前线的越南人民怀着强烈的革命豪情，努力学习《毛主席语录》。
