The East Wind blows strongly, and the red flag flies high. The situation is excellent, and good news is frequently reported. The mass publication and distribution of the red treasure, Chairman Mao's works, this year is another great joy for the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. The mass publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works provide the most important conditions for the revolutionary people of the whole country and the whole world to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought. This will greatly promote the further widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought throughout China and the world. This is another great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Vice Chairman Lin instructs us: "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman; conducting revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." We workers, peasants, and soldiers have unlimited faith and loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Every word and every letter of Chairman Mao are the highest directives for our actions.

Vice Chairman Lin's proposal of "studying with questions in mind, actively studying and applying, combining study with use, learning what is urgently needed first, seeing immediate results, and focusing on the 'use' aspect" is the most fundamental principle, the most correct path, and the most effective method for studying Chairman Mao's works. I understand that the core of Vice Chairman Lin's instructions lies in the word "use." Whether we use what we have learned from Chairman Mao's works or not, whether we apply it vigorously or not; whether we follow Chairman Mao's instructions or not, whether we follow them closely or not, this is not a trivial matter, but a fundamental issue of stance and attitude. It is the touchstone for whether one is a true revolutionary or a false one. A genuine proletarian revolutionary must carry out Chairman Mao's instructions with resolute and unyielding actions.

To achieve the combination of study and use, and to see immediate results, one must study and apply with deep class feelings towards Chairman Mao and his works. Never forget the bitterness of class struggle and national hatred; always remember Chairman Mao's kindness; never forget the arduous struggle of the Chinese revolution; always remember Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness; never forget that imperialists, revisionists, and counter-revolutionaries still exist, and always remember the historical mission to carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution to the end; never forget Chairman Mao's earnest expectations, and always remember the lofty responsibility of being a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Only in this way can one be truly loyal to Chairman Mao and truly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.

To achieve the combination of study and use, and to see immediate results, one must closely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle commands of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and act swiftly. One must learn quickly, understand quickly, propagate quickly, and execute quickly. Chairman Mao's instructions are absolutely correct. We must resolutely carry out what we understand and also resolutely carry out what we do not understand for the time being. We must ensure that every instruction is implemented and every sentence is followed.

To achieve the combination of study and use, and to see immediate results, one must fiercely combat the non-proletarian thoughts in one's mind. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without clearing, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest proletarian revolutionary theory of our time. It reflects the greatest interests of the broadest masses of people. It is the strongest ideological weapon for the proletariat of our time to strive for liberation. It is diametrically opposed to and incompatible with all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts. Studying Chairman Mao's works and carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions is a process of using the great Mao Zedong Thought to combat one's own non-proletarian thoughts, and a process of destroying private interests and establishing public interests. Practice has proven that our inability to understand, implement, and act on Mao Zedong Thought is often due to the various non-proletarian thoughts in our minds. The more such thoughts interfere, the more we must use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze ourselves, touch our souls, fiercely combat private interests, and use the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the "target" of various non-proletarian thoughts, using Mao Zedong Thought to defeat various non-proletarian thoughts.

To destroy private interests and establish public interests, one must have a self-aware revolutionary determination and master the weapon of self-criticism. We must be bold not only in fighting class enemies but also in making revolution in our own minds. In this way, we can continuously reform ourselves, continuously raise our consciousness, and increasingly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and consciously follow the great leader Chairman Mao forward.

Studying Chairman Mao's works, combining study with use, and seeing immediate results is a concrete manifestation of a revolutionary's unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought. I am determined to study and apply Chairman Mao's works vigorously for life, to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" for life, and to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

    活学活用毛主席著作永不停息
    丰福生
    东风劲吹，红旗飘扬，形势大好，捷报频传。红色宝书毛主席著作，今年大量出版发行。这是亿万革命人民的又一特大喜事。毛主席著作的大量出版发行，为全国全世界革命人民活学活用毛主席著作、掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，提供了最重要的条件，它将极大地促进毛泽东思想在全中国全世界进一步的大普及、大传播。这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。
    林副主席指示我们：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。我们工农兵对毛主席和毛泽东思想无限信仰，无限忠诚。毛主席他老人家的每句话每个字，都是我们行动的最高准则。
    林副主席提出的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”，这是学习毛主席著作最根本的原则，最正确的道路，最有效的方法。我体会到林副主席指示的核心在一个“用”字上。学了毛主席著作，用还是不用，用得狠还是不狠；对毛主席的指示，跟还是不跟，跟得紧还是不紧，这不是一般问题，而是个根本立场和根本态度问题，这是真革命还是假革命的试金石。真正的无产阶级革命战士，对伟大领袖毛主席的指示，必然雷厉风行地、不折不扣地坚决照办。
    要做到学用结合，立竿见影，就要带着对毛主席、对毛主席著作的深厚阶级感情去学去用。不忘阶级苦、民族恨，牢记毛主席的恩情；不忘中国革命的艰苦斗争历程，牢记毛主席的英明伟大；不忘帝修反和国内走资派还存在，牢记将中国革命和世界革命进行到底的历史使命；不忘毛主席对我们的殷切期望，牢记无产阶级革命事业接班人的崇高责任。只有这样，才能无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想。
    要做到学用结合，立竿见影，就要对毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，跟得紧，行动快。要做到学习快，领会快，宣传快，执行快。毛主席的指示，一千万个正确，一万万个正确，我们理解的要坚决执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，要做到条条落实，句句照办。
    要做到学用结合，立竿见影，就要狠斗自己头脑里的非无产阶级思想。毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。毛泽东思想是当代最伟大的无产阶级革命理论。它反映了最广大人民的最大利益。它是当代无产阶级争取解放的最强大的思想武器。它和一切资产阶级小资产阶级思想针锋相对，水火不容。学习毛主席著作，执行毛主席指示，必然是用伟大的毛泽东思想同自己的非无产阶级思想斗争的过程，必然是一个破私立公的过程。实践证明，我们对毛泽东思想理解不了、贯彻不力、行动迟缓，往往是由于我们头脑里的各种非无产阶级思想在作怪。越是在这种时候，我们越要用毛泽东思想来观察分析自己，触及灵魂，狠斗私心，用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射自己的各种非无产阶级思想之“的”，用毛泽东思想去战胜各种非无产阶级思想。
    破私立公，要有自觉革命的决心，要掌握自我批评的武器。我们不仅在同阶级敌人斗争中要敢字当头，在自己头脑里闹革命也要敢字当头。这样我们就能够不断地改造自己，不断地提高觉悟，就可以越来越多地掌握毛泽东思想，越来越自觉地紧跟伟大领袖毛主席前进。
    学习毛主席著作，学用结合，立竿见影，是革命战士无限忠于毛泽东思想的具体表现。我决心一辈子狠学狠用毛主席著作，一辈子“斗私，批修”，一辈子跟着毛主席干革命。
