Our great leader Chairman Mao is deeply concerned about the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Huainan. In October, he specially invited Prime Minister Noumara Dzalaye and the delegation he led from the Congo (Brazzaville) to visit Huainan to see the achievements and new level reached by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution there.

What is the current situation in Huainan? This is a question of great concern to the people of the entire nation. Recently, a reporter visited Huainan and was excited to see that the situation there is excellent and getting better and better.

In Huainan, the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping through like a storm, cleansing all the filth left over from the old society. Great Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated deeply into people's hearts, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved decisive victory. In the mining areas stretching for dozens of miles, revolutionary fervor is everywhere, with big debates, big-character posters, and big criticisms flourishing. In this vast sea of revolution, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists have met their doom.

In the mining areas, a production upsurge is surging. Majestic mine towers flutter with red flags. Tall chimneys spew out smoke. At night, millions of lights weave a dazzling river of light. As dawn approaches, train after train and boat after boat, loaded with coal, rush busily towards Shanghai and various places in East China, supporting the socialist construction of the motherland.

The excellent situation is the result of struggle

Huainan is one of the coal industry bases in our country. During the Cultural Revolution, the workers of Huainan, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, and the broad revolutionary masses, with the momentum of an irresistible force, defeated a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, making them suffer a crushing defeat.

However, the dying class enemies are not willing to accept their doom. The Chinese Khrushchev's agents in Anhui and Huainan played all sorts of tricks and schemes, trying every means to extinguish the revolutionary flame. First, they sent large numbers of work teams to implement the bourgeois reactionary line, labeling a large number of revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries." Then, to protect themselves, they deceived part of the masses to oppose revolutionary mass organizations, inciting masses to fight against masses, splitting the ranks of the working class. Later, they colluded with the ghosts and monsters in society and a few bad elements who had infiltrated revolutionary organizations, using the differences of opinion among revolutionary masses and the anarchist tendencies and bourgeois, petty-bourgeois factionalism within revolutionary mass organizations to stir up trouble, create chaos, and instigate armed struggles.

For a time, chaos reigned. A handful of class enemies incited work stoppages, destroyed state property, disrupted revolutionary order, and attempted to "change the sky."

However, contrary to the dreams of these handful of class enemies, under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and with the support and protection of the People's Liberation Army, the enemies' plots and tricks were finally smashed, and the broad revolutionary masses were tempered.

The stupid class enemies never imagined that, at the very moment they were fully performing, they exposed their true selves and lifted the stone that crushed their own feet.

In one mine, a capitalist-roader within the Party, in order to shift the direction of the struggle, on the one hand incited the masses to fight against the cadres, and on the other hand incited the cadres to fight against the masses. After the revolutionary masses split into two factions and started an "internal war," he continued to stir up trouble from behind the scenes, saying to one faction today, "You do it, I'll support you!" and to the other faction tomorrow, "Do it hard, I support you!" When the masses were fighting the "internal war," he slipped away and watched from the sidelines. Later, the two factions of revolutionary masses achieved revolutionary great unity, and together reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." They opened their hearts to each other, timely exposed the class enemies' plots, and said, "In the past, we fought the 'internal war' and fell into the enemy's trap. We must unite against the enemy and cut off this poisonous snake!"

The reality of class struggle also opened the eyes of the deceived masses, isolating a few bad leaders who had infiltrated the revolutionary mass organizations.

One bad leader, with an extremely "leftist" appearance, deceived the masses, usurped the leadership of the revolutionary mass organization, and incited a part of the deceived masses to smash and loot everywhere. Facts educated the masses. They immediately exposed the bad leader, thoroughly exposed his crimes, and learned from the experience. They said, "After this struggle, everyone has shown their true colors. Everyone has a clear account of who is good and who is bad. Bad people can no longer deceive anyone."

The reality of class struggle enhanced the revolutionary masses' awareness of the enemy, heightened the masses' revolutionary vigilance, and inspired them to unite more closely to fight against the class enemies.

The leaders of the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations in Xie San Mine are two class brothers from poor peasant backgrounds who entered the mine at the same time. During the Cultural Revolution, they rebelled together and were both labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." However, the instigation of the class enemies made them into "bitter enemies." Chairman Mao's latest instructions awakened the class consciousness of the workers. When people sat together and recalled the harm caused by the split, they angrily said: We workers are all on the same vine, how can there be fundamental conflicts of interest? Who split us? Who diverted our struggle target? It was all the class enemies who stuck their black hands in! The class enemies are most afraid of the unity of the working class. We must unite even more closely, form a fist, and give the class enemies a hard blow!

Talking about this, an old miner in his fifties excitedly said:

"After this struggle, the ghosts and monsters, revisionists have been exposed. If these ghosts and monsters, revisionists are not exposed, big troubles will happen in the future. These bad guys are like the pus on the body. Once exposed and squeezed, the body becomes healthy, and the proletarian state becomes more solid!"

The struggle in Huainan proves: Where the struggle is sharp and intense, there are often class enemies at work. "The tree wants to be still, but the wind does not stop." "Human society has developed from great winds and waves." We must see clearly, stand firm, and mobilize and educate the masses to win victory against the class enemies' arrogant attacks.

Tempered and Educated the Masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "War educates the people, the people will win the war, win peace, and win progress."

In the practice of class struggle, the revolutionary masses, through repeated struggles, have come to understand the correct and incorrect sides, what is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and what is the bourgeois reactionary line, deepening their understanding of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line time and time again.

Huainan has a super-high methane mine. If the exhaust fan stops for a moment, a methane explosion could occur. During the days when the class enemies instigated armed struggles, some workers left their posts. Old workers Fan Guangjin and Li Qingshan, although from opposing factions, still went to work as usual. Someone said to them, "It's dangerous here, why are you still working?"

Fan Guangjin firmly replied: "Chairman Mao teaches us to put revolutionary interests first. A true revolutionary cannot stand by and watch the mine explode!"

Li Qingshan proudly said: "This is a real test of revolution. We must swear to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and protect the interests of the state!"

They moved their bedding next to the machine, ate by the machine, slept by the machine, and worked by the machine, not leaving for a single minute. They protected the machine like they protected their eyes and guarded the mine like sentinels.

When recalling the hardships of the old society, Fan Guangjin excitedly said: "Old Li! Chairman Mao saved us. We must resolutely stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must stand firm at critical moments!"

Li Qingshan firmly replied: "Yes, we are two factions, but we should have only one viewpoint: the viewpoint of Mao Zedong Thought! Only one line: Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Only one heart: grasp the revolution, promote production!"

This is the voice from the heart of the old workers, the voice of the masters of the era! This voice is so firm, so loud, it expresses the deep understanding of the Huainan working class of Mao Zedong Thought, and their limitless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line.

After being tempered by the struggle, the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers in Huainan has been further heightened. They further realized that the fundamental interests of the working class are completely consistent, and consciously struggled to defend Mao Zedong Thought and the overall interests of the working class.

In the tunneling team of Xie Yi Mine, there is a blaster named Yang, who was deceived into participating in the "internal war." On the way, he recalled the bitter days of begging with his mother before liberation and thought, who are we fighting now? Aren't we fighting our class brothers who, like us, were poor and suffered under the capitalists' whips, ate bran, wore burlap, and slept in grass huts? What reason is there to be so irreconcilable? Thinking of this, he resolutely withdrew from the factional struggle without principles and actively propagated the great truth of unity against the enemy to other workers.

After being tempered by the struggle, the broad revolutionary masses further recognized the harm of "selfishness" and bourgeois, petty-bourgeois factionalism. Some responsible comrades of the revolutionary mass organizations in Huainan, reviewing more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply felt: "Through this struggle, not only the class enemies were exposed, but also the 'selfishness' in our minds. The class enemies are using the 'selfishness' in our minds to divert the direction of the struggle, attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only by fighting against 'selfishness' and digging out the roots of revisionism can we follow the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Huainan."

    战地黄花分外香
    ——从激烈的阶级斗争中看淮南的大好形势
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，非常关心淮南无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，十月间特意邀请努马扎莱总理和他率领的刚果（布）代表团访问淮南，看一看那里无产阶级文化大革命的成就和达到的新水平。
    现在，淮南的形势怎样？这是全国人民十分关心的问题。最近，记者走访了淮南，兴奋地看到了淮南形势大好，而且越来越好。
    在淮南，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，象急风暴雨，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的一切污泥浊水。伟大的毛泽东思想深入人心，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性的胜利。纵横数十里的矿区里，处处洋溢着大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的革命气氛，革命大批判专栏林立。在革命的汪洋大海里，一小撮反革命修正主义分子遭到了灭顶之灾。
    矿区里，生产热潮滚滚。雄伟的井架，飘扬着红旗。高大的烟囱，喷吐着烟云。入夜，千万盏灯火，织成了光辉瑰丽的长河。迎着黎明，一列列火车，一艘艘帆船，满载着煤炭，紧张而繁忙地向上海、向华东各地驰去，支援祖国社会主义建设。
      大好形势是经过斗争得来的
    淮南是我国煤炭工业基地之一。在文化大革命中，具有光荣革命传统的淮南工人阶级和广大革命群众，以排山倒海之势，把党内一小撮走资派，打得落花流水。
    但是，垂死的阶级敌人决不甘心自己的灭亡。中国赫鲁晓夫在安徽、淮南的代理人，玩弄种种阴谋花招，千方百计地妄图扑灭革命火焰。他们先是大派工作组，推行资产阶级反动路线，把大批革命群众打成“反革命”。接着，为保他们自己，又蒙蔽部分群众与革命群众组织相对抗，挑动群众斗群众，分裂工人阶级的队伍。后来，他们又伙同社会上的牛鬼蛇神和混入革命组织中的少数坏人，利用革命群众间的意见分歧，利用革命群众组织内部的某些无政府主义思潮和资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，挑拨离间，煽风点火，制造混乱，挑起武斗。
    一时间，乱云纷飞。一小撮阶级敌人煽动停工停产，毁坏国家财产，破坏革命秩序，妄图“变天”。
    但是，与这一小撮阶级敌人的梦想相反，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自领导下，在无产阶级专政条件下，在人民解放军的支持和保卫下，终于粉碎了敌人的阴谋诡计，并且锻炼了广大的革命群众。
    愚蠢的阶级敌人万万没有想到，就在他们充分表演的时候，恰恰暴露了自己的真面目，搬起石头砸了自己的脚。
    有一个矿的党内走资派，为了转移斗争大方向，一方面挑动群众斗干部，一方面又挑动干部整群众。革命群众分成两大派打起“内战”以后，他继续躲在背后挑拨，今天对这派说：“你们干，我撑腰！”明天跟那派说：“狠干，我支持！”群众打“内战”，他乘机溜掉，坐山观虎斗。后来，两派革命群众实现了革命大联合，一起重温毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”大家相互交心亮思想，及时识破了阶级敌人的阴谋。他们说：“过去我们打‘内战’，上了敌人的当。我们一定要共同对敌，斩断这毒蛇！”
    阶级斗争的现实，也擦亮了受蒙蔽群众的眼睛，孤立了少数混进革命群众组织中的坏头头。
    有一个坏头头，曾以极“左”的面貌，骗取了群众的信任，窃取了革命群众组织的领导地位，煽动一部分受蒙蔽群众，到处打、砸……。事实教育了群众。他们不但立刻将坏头头揪了出来，彻底揭露其罪行，而且从中吸取了经验教训。他们说：“经过这么一场斗争，每个人都亮了一次相。花脸黑脸，人人心中有本账。坏人再也难以骗人了。”
    阶级斗争的现实，增强了革命群众的敌情观念，提高了群众的革命警惕，激发他们更加紧密地团结起来，同阶级敌人作斗争。
    谢三矿两派群众组织的头头，是两个贫农出身、同时进矿的阶级兄弟。在文化大革命中，他们一起造反，一起被打成“反革命”。可是，阶级敌人的挑唆，却使他们变成了“冤家对头”。毛主席的最新指示，唤醒了工人们的阶级觉悟。当人们在一起促膝谈心，回忆到分裂带给工人阶级的危害时，他们愤怒地说：我们工人阶级是一根藤上的瓜，哪有什么根本的利害冲突？是谁使我们分裂？是谁转移了我们的斗争目标？都是阶级敌人插进了黑手！阶级敌人最害怕工人阶级团结，我们就越要团结起来，捏成一个拳头，狠狠打击阶级敌人！
    谈到这些，一个五十多岁的老矿工兴奋地说：
      “经过这么一场斗争，牛鬼蛇神、修正主义分子暴露出来了。不暴露出这些牛鬼蛇神、修正主义分子，将来就要出大乱子。这些坏家伙跟人身上的脓疮一样，一暴露，一挤脓，身体就健康了，无产阶级的江山就更加巩固了！”
    淮南的斗争证明：凡是斗争尖锐激烈的地方，往往有阶级敌人在捣鬼。“树欲静而风不止”。“人类社会就是从大风大浪中发展起来的。”对阶级敌人的猖狂进攻，我们要看得清，要顶得住，要发动群众、教育群众，去夺取胜利。
        锻炼了群众，教育了群众
    毛主席教导我们说：“战争教育了人民，人民将赢得战争，赢得和平，又赢得进步。”
    革命群众在阶级斗争的实践中，经过多次反复，认识了正确方面和错误方面，认识了什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线，一次又一次地加深了对战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席无产阶级革命路线的理解。
    淮南有一个超级瓦斯矿。抽风机只要停止片刻，就可能发生瓦斯爆炸。在阶级敌人挑起武斗的日子里，一些工人离开了工作岗位。老工人樊广金、李青山等，虽然是对立的两派，却照常上班。有人对他们说：“这里危险，你们还上班干啥？”
    樊广金坚毅地回答：
      “毛主席教导我们，要把革命利益摆在第一位。真革命的，就不能眼看着矿山爆炸！”
    李青山也自豪地说：
      “这是一个真正的革命考验，我们要誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线，保护国家的利益！”
    他们把铺盖搬到机器旁边，吃在机旁，睡在机旁，工作在机旁，一分钟也不离开。他们象保护眼睛一样保护着机器，象哨兵一样守卫着矿山。
    在共同回忆起旧社会的苦难时，樊广金激动地说：
      “老李啊！毛主席解救了我们，我们要坚决站到毛主席的革命路线上来，节骨眼上可要顶得住啊！”
    李青山坚定地回答：
    “对，咱们两人是两派，但应该只有一个观点：毛泽东思想的观点！只有一条路线：毛主席的革命路线！只有一个心眼：抓革命，促生产！”
    这是老工人发自肺腑的声音，是时代主人的声音！这声音，是那样坚定，那样宏亮，它表达了淮南工人阶级对毛泽东思想的深切体会，对伟大领袖毛主席和毛主席的革命路线的无限忠诚。
    经过斗争的锻炼，淮南的广大工人群众的阶级觉悟更加提高了。他们进一步认识到工人阶级的根本利益是完全一致的，自觉地为保卫毛泽东思想、保卫工人阶级的整体利益而斗争。
    谢一矿掘进队有个姓杨的放炮工，受了蒙蔽去参加打“内战”。走在路上，他回忆解放前跟着母亲乞讨的苦日子，心想，现在这是去打谁呢？打的不就是和自己一样穷苦出身的阶级兄弟吗？我们解放前同样挨资本家的鞭子，同样吃麦麸面，同样围麻袋片，同样睡草棚地窝子，……有什么理由要如此势不两立呢？想到这里，他毅然决然地退出了无原则的派别斗争，积极向其他工人宣传团结对敌的大道理。
    经过斗争的锻炼，广大革命群众还进一步认识了“私”字和资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的危害。淮南革命群众组织的一些负责人，回顾一年多文化大革命的历程时，深有感受地说：“经过这场斗争，不仅暴露了阶级敌人，也暴露了我们头脑中‘私’字这个敌人。阶级敌人就是利用我们头脑中的‘私’字，转移斗争大方向，妄图破坏文化大革命的。只有狠斗‘私’字，深挖修根，才能紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，夺取淮南无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。”
