After India declared independence, the Indian National Congress government, representing the interests of the big bourgeoisie and landlords, used so-called "land reform" to deceive the peasants. The Soviet revisionists and Indian revisionists also did their utmost to whitewash the "land reform" of the Indian National Congress government, claiming that the "land law" of the Indian National Congress government is a "thoroughly anti-feudal program," "weakened the feudal exploitation system," and "solved the peasants' land problem," and so on. This is a blatant lie, a great betrayal of the Indian revolution, and a great sellout of the Indian people.

The "land reform" of the Indian National Congress reactionary government is purely a deception of the peasants and a means to maintain the interests of the landlord class. After the "land reform," India's feudal land ownership system remained completely untouched. A few landlords and rich peasants still owned the vast majority of the land, while the vast majority of poor and hired peasants had no land or only a very small amount of land. According to Indian official statistics from 1966, the 20% of landlords and rich peasants out of the total of one billion peasant households owned 75% of the total land area, while the 80% of peasants out of the total number of peasant households only owned 25% of the total land area. This fact completely exposes the blatant lie that the Soviet revisionists and Indian revisionists have been hyping up about "the land problem of Indian peasants being solved."

In Indian villages, the widespread form of rent is the sharecropping system, where peasants pay rent to landlords based on the crop yield. This system exploits Indian peasants extremely heavily. In general areas, peasants pay rent to landlords that accounts for half of the total yield, and in some areas, the rent is as high as 83.9% and 90.4% of the total yield. In addition to paying heavy rent, tenant farmers also have to perform unpaid labor or labor with extremely low pay for the landlords during the off-season.

India's usury exploitation is world-renowned. The debt burden of the vast majority of Indian peasants is extremely heavy. According to a survey by the Indian Savings Bank, in June 1962, 62.1% of all rural residents were in debt; from June 1952 to June 1962, the average debt of each indebted peasant in India increased from 447 rupees to 654 rupees, an increase of 46.5%.

In Indian villages, exploitative commercial exploitation has accelerated the impoverishment of the vast majority of peasants. The commercial capital in India exploits peasants mainly in two ways: first, through the scissors difference in purchasing agricultural products and selling industrial products. Second, landlords, speculators, and usurers exploit the famine by hoarding goods and making huge profits.

The big bourgeoisie and landlords also continuously increase various taxes on peasants through the Indian National Congress reactionary government to strengthen their plunder. Comparing the years 1950-1951 with 1962-1963, taxes on agriculture increased from 556.7 million rupees to 1,342 million rupees, more than doubling. Land tax increased from 652.3 million rupees in 1961-1962 to 1,207 million rupees in 1962-1963, nearly doubling in one year. In addition to land tax, the government also levies various miscellaneous taxes on peasants, such as "irrigation tax," "soil improvement tax," and "land surcharge."

The actual situation in Indian villages fully illustrates that the contradiction between the landlord class and the peasants remains the fundamental contradiction in today's Indian villages.

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party has already seen through the traitorous face of the revisionists and begun to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, going to the villages and mobilizing the peasants to engage in armed struggle. This is the only way out for Indian peasants.

Famine is becoming increasingly severe in Indian villages. The vast majority of peasants, unable to bear the ruthless exploitation of landlords, are forced to leave their homes and fields, leading to barren and cracked farmland.

    印度农村的残酷封建剥削
    印度宣布独立以后，代表大资产阶级、大地主利益的国大党政府，曾用所谓“土地改革”来欺骗农民。苏修和印修分子也竭力替国大党政府的“土地改革”涂脂抹粉，说什么国大党政府的“土地法”是“彻底的反封建的纲领”，“削弱了封建剥削制度”，“解决了农民的土地问题”，等等。这是一个弥天大谎，是对印度革命的大背叛，是对印度人民的大出卖。
    印度国大党反动政府的“土改法”纯粹是欺骗农民，维护地主阶级利益的。“土地改革”以后，印度的封建土地占有制度丝毫没有被触动，少数地主、富农仍然占有绝大部分土地，而广大贫雇农则没有或只占有极少的土地。据印度官方一九六六年的统计，占一亿农户总数百分之二十的地主、富农，占有土地总面积百分之七十五的土地，而占农户总数百分之八十的农民，只占有土地总面积百分之二十五的土地。这一事实，彻底粉碎了苏修和印修大肆宣扬的“印度农民的土地问题解决了”的弥天大谎。
    在印度农村，广泛流行的地租形式是分成制，即农民按照收成的比例向地主交租。这种制度对印度农民的剥削异常惨重，一般地区农民向地主交租要占总收成的一半，有的地区地租竟高达总收成的百分之八十三点九和百分之九十点四。佃农除了交沉重的地租外，在农闲期间，还要负担对地主的无偿劳动或报酬极少的劳动。
    印度的高利贷剥削是世界闻名的。印度广大农民的债务负担，十分可怕。据印度储蓄银行调查，在一九六二年六月，欠债农户占全体农村居民的百分之六十二点一；自一九五二年六月至一九六二年六月，印度每一欠债农户的欠债额平均由四百四十七卢比增加到六百五十四卢比，即增加了百分之四十六点五。
    在印度农村，盘剥性的商业剥削加速了广大农民的贫困化。印度商业资本剥削农民主要有两种方式：一、通过收购农产品和销售工业品的剪刀差进行剥削。二、地主、投机商、高利贷者利用饥荒囤积居奇，牟取暴利。
    大资产阶级、大地主还通过国大党反动政府不断增加对农民的苛捐杂税来加强掠夺。拿一九五○至一九五一年同一九六二至一九六三年比较，对农业方面的税收就从五亿五千六百七十万卢比增加到十三亿四千二百万卢比，即增加一倍多。土地税从一九六一至一九六二年的六亿五千二百三十万卢比增至一九六二至一九六三年的十二亿零七百万卢比，一年即增加将近一倍。除土地税外，政府还向农民征收“灌溉税”、“土壤改良税”、“土地附加税”等名目繁多的苛捐杂税。
    印度农村的实际情况，充分说明地主阶级和农民的矛盾，仍然是今日印度农村的基本矛盾。
    在光芒万丈的毛泽东思想的照耀下，印共革命派已经识破了修正主义者的叛徒面目，开始走上毛主席所指引的道路，到农村去，发动农民进行武装斗争。这是印度农民的唯一出路。

    在印度农村，饥荒日益严重，广大农民不堪地主的残酷剥削，被迫背井离乡，耕地荒芜龟裂。
