The revolutionary workers of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, solemnly held a rally to promote revolutionary unity on the afternoon of the 6th. The meeting summarized and exchanged experiences in achieving revolutionary unity, commended advanced units that had achieved revolutionary unity, and further promoted the realization of comprehensive revolutionary unity by system and department throughout the bureau, and the implementation of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Revolutionary workers from all four provinces along the Liuzhou Railway line simultaneously listened to the live broadcast of this meeting through wired broadcasts.

At 2 PM, the two revolutionary factions of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau, organized by administrative departments, carried Chairman Mao's portrait and red flags, joyfully gathered from all directions to the Eshan Stadium. The stadium was filled with red flags, drums, and firecrackers, with slogans echoing through the sky. They held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted: "Unite for the revolution! Unite to carry out the revolution!" "The working class must unite to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live, long, long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Representatives from units like the Liuzhou Materials General Factory, which had already achieved revolutionary unity, reported on their unit's achievements in revolutionary unity and shared their experiences and insights. The representatives said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.' This is a great call, a common program of action for the people of the whole country. We firmly implement it, word for word, character for character, and rapidly achieve revolutionary unity. The representatives also said based on their personal experiences: Only by uniting can we concentrate our firepower to strike down the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line; only by uniting can we facilitate the great criticism of the revolution, improve the struggle-criticism-transformation of our unit; only by uniting can we expose the evil plots of all ghosts and snakes; only by uniting can we seize the revolution and promote production.

When the representatives reported on the experiences of achieving revolutionary unity, they unanimously pointed out: To achieve revolutionary unity, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to understand the situation, use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize everything, transform everything, and command everything; to achieve revolutionary unity, we must take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, consciously carry out criticism and self-criticism, break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, both sides should act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, speak less about others' shortcomings and mistakes, and each should engage more in self-criticism; to achieve revolutionary unity, we must be proactive and high-minded, do things that are beneficial to revolutionary unity, say words that are beneficial to revolutionary unity, consider the overall situation, understand the big picture, seek common ground while reserving differences.

Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and responsible person of the 6973 Unit of the PLA Liuzhou Garrison, Sun Fengzhang, spoke at the meeting, warmly congratulating the convening of this meeting. He said, accelerating the achievement of revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination is the most practical manifestation of following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and the need of the revolutionary struggle situation. Achieving and consolidating revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination is also a struggle between two lines and two worldviews. Therefore, to achieve and consolidate revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and conduct extensive classes on Mao Zedong Thought; we must correctly implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, for cadres who have made mistakes, we must look at them and help them, expand the scope of education, and strive to liberate more cadres to create conditions for further achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Sun Fengzhang finally hoped that the two revolutionary factions of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau would follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, rapidly achieve revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the Liuzhou Railway area, and set an example for the Liuzhou area and the entire Guangxi region.

The meeting ended triumphantly with the song "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depends on the Helmsman."

The revolutionary workers of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau, with the help of the PLA's support-left troops, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon and "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, broke down selfishness and established public-mindedness, and on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, launched a high tide of revolutionary unity.

Now, the situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the Liuzhou Railway Bureau is excellent. Chairman Mao's great call for revolutionary mass organizations to achieve revolutionary unity has been put into action by all the workers and family members of the bureau. The two revolutionary factions of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau, to develop and consolidate revolutionary unity, established a preparatory committee for revolutionary unity. To implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp the revolution and promote production," they quickly launched a new high tide of transportation and production after negotiations, forming a temporary production command department with military personnel, revolutionary leading cadres, and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations. The revolutionary and production situation is getting better and better. The volume of freight has increased significantly, and the order at the stations has been renewed.

After Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China were issued, all the soldiers and officers of the support-left troops took immediate action and widely propagated them. They used various forms to propagate the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the two revolutionary factions. Chairman Mao's words are the highest and most powerful, one sentence is worth ten thousand. Through the extensive propaganda and mobilization by the support-left troops, the broad revolutionary masses gradually realized that the attitude towards revolutionary unity is a touchstone to test whether we are thorough revolutionaries or revolutionary talkers. The broad revolutionary masses unanimously expressed that they would firmly believe in Chairman Mao's latest instructions and resolutely follow them.

To effectively promote the revolutionary unity of the two revolutionary mass organizations, the support-left troops, while widely propagating and mobilizing, also actively organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, bringing the backbone of the two factions to the study classes to deeply study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further removing the ideological obstacles to achieving revolutionary unity. Over nine thousand people who participated in the study classes, under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, had their ideological awareness greatly improved. After returning to their respective units, they actively promoted revolutionary unity in their units, accelerating the process of revolutionary unity in various units.

The revolutionary unity of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau has achieved initial results. Currently, the support-left troops and the Liuzhou Railway Bureau Revolutionary Unity Preparatory Committee are summarizing experiences and further developing and consolidating revolutionary unity.

    据新华社柳州九日电　柳州铁路局广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在六日下午隆重地举行了促进革命大联合的誓师大会。这次大会总结交流了实现革命大联合的经验，表扬实现革命大联合的先进单位，以便进一步促进全路局尽快实现全面的按系统、按部门的革命大联合，实现革命三结合。柳州铁路局全线所属四省的广大革命职工，同时通过有线广播，收听了这个大会的实况广播。
    下午二时，柳州铁路局两大派革命群众，以行政部门为单位，高举伟大领袖毛主席画像和红旗，喜气洋洋地从四面八方聚集到峨山体育场。会场上，红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，鞭炮声、口号声响彻云霄。他们举着《毛主席语录》一遍又一遍地高呼：“为革命而联合！联合起来干革命！”“工人阶级联合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    已经实现革命大联合的柳州材料总厂等单位代表，在大会上汇报了本单位实现革命大联合的情况，交流了革命大联合的经验和体会。代表们说，毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”这是伟大的号召，是全国人民的共同行动纲领，我们坚决照办，字字照办，迅速实现革命的大联合。代表们还根据自己的切身体会说：只有联合起来，才能集中火力打击党内一小撮走资派，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线；只有联合起来，才有利于开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改；只有联合起来，才有利于揭露一切牛鬼蛇神的罪恶阴谋；只有联合起来，才有利于抓革命促生产。
    代表们在汇报实现革命大联合经验的时候，一致指出：要实现革命的大联合，就必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，用毛泽东思想认清形势，用毛泽东思想批判一切，改造一切，统帅一切；要实现革命大联合，就必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，自觉地开展批评与自我批评，大破私字，大立公字，双方都要按照毛主席教导办事，少讲别人的缺点和错误，各自多作自我批评；要实现革命的大联合，就必须积极主动，高姿态，有利于革命大联合的事要主动去做，有利于革命大联合的话要多说，顾大局，识大体，求大同，存小异。
    广西壮族自治区革命委员会筹备小组成员、中国人民解放军柳州驻军六九七三部队负责人孙凤璋，在大会上讲话，热烈祝贺这次大会的召开。他说，加快实现革命的大联合和革命三结合，是紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署的最实际的体现，是革命斗争形势的需要。实现和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，也是两条路线、两种世界观的斗争。因此，要实现和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，活学活用毛主席著作，大办毛泽东思想学习班，要很好地斗私批修，改造世界观；同时，要正确执行毛主席的干部政策，对犯了错误的干部，要一看二帮，要扩大教育面，争取解放更多的干部，为进一步实现革命的三结合创造条件。孙凤璋最后希望柳州铁路局两派革命群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，尽快实现柳州铁路局地区的革命大联合和革命的三结合，为柳州地区和广西全区作出榜样。
    大会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
    据新华社柳州九日电　广西柳州铁路局全线两大派革命群众组织，在中国人民解放军支左部队的帮助下，以伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在毛泽东思想的基础上，掀起了革命大联合高潮。
    现在，柳州铁路局的无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好。毛主席关于革命群众组织要实现革命大联合的伟大号召，全局职工、家属已经雷厉风行地见之于行动。柳州铁路局两大派革命群众组织，为发展和巩固革命大联合，成立了革命大联合筹备委员会。为贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，迅速掀起运输生产新高潮，经双方协商，又组成了有军队人员、革命领导干部和革命群众组织代表参加的临时生产指挥部。革命和生产形势越来越好。货运量大幅度增长，车站秩序也焕然一新。
    毛主席视察华北、中南、华东地区时所作的一系列极为重要指示传出后，支左部队全体指战员闻风而动，广泛宣传。他们用各种形式向两派革命群众宣传毛主席最新指示的伟大意义。毛主席的话，水平最高，威力最大，一句顶一万句。经过部队支左人员的大宣传、大发动，广大革命群众逐步认识到对待革命的大联合，是检验我们是完全革命派还是口头革命派的试金石。广大革命群众纷纷表示，对毛主席的这一最新指示，要无比坚信，要坚决紧跟。
    为了有效地促进两派革命群众组织实现革命的大联合，支左部队指战员在普遍宣传发动的同时，又积极举办毛泽东思想学习班，把两派骨干组织到学习班里，深入学习毛主席的最新指示，进一步扫清实现革命大联合的思想障碍。参加学习班学习的九千多人，在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，思想觉悟大大提高，回到各单位以后积极促进本单位的革命大联合，加速了各单位革命大联合的进程。
    柳州铁路局的革命大联合，已经取得了初步的成果。目前，支左部队和柳州铁路局革命大联合筹备委员会，正在总结经验，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合。
