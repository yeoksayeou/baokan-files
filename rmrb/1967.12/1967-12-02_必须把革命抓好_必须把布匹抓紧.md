The nationwide conference on grasping the revolution and promoting production in the textile industry demands that all revolutionary workers closely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao.

	Actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, enhance proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, and rapidly achieve revolutionary great unity by system and by industry; units that have already achieved revolutionary great unity should consolidate it politically and ideologically. Firmly support revolutionary cadres to come forward, boldly liberate and use cadres, and achieve and consolidate the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Carry out a thorough criticism and rectification of the revolution within the unit. Riding on the great momentum of the Cultural Revolution, complete the production and construction tasks of the textile industry quickly, efficiently, economically, and effectively.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on December 1st, the recent nationwide conference on grasping the revolution and promoting production in the textile industry, held in Beijing, demanded that revolutionary workers and cadres in the textile industry across the country resolutely and thoroughly implement the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the great criticism of the revolution, carry out a thorough criticism and rectification within the unit, and carry the Cultural Revolution in the textile system through to the end. The conference demanded that revolutionary workers in the textile industry across the country further implement the policy of "grasp the revolution and promote production," enthusiastically respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "must grasp grain, must grasp cotton, must grasp cloth," ride the great momentum of the unprecedentedly good situation of the Cultural Revolution, and complete the production and construction tasks quickly, efficiently, economically, and effectively, seizing double victories in revolution and production!

	During the conference, representatives from the textile industry systems of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, revolutionary cadres, and the People's Liberation Army, who were responsible for supporting the left and supporting work in the textile industry, seriously studied the extremely important latest instructions given by the great leader Chairman Mao during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China. They reviewed the fighting course of the Cultural Revolution in the textile industry system over the past more than a year. Everyone felt that the Cultural Revolution and production construction in the textile industry system across the country are now facing an unprecedentedly good situation. The broad masses of workers in the textile industry have never been so extensively and deeply mobilized as they are now. The counter-revolutionary revisionist line that Khrushchev and his agents in the textile industry system have been pushing for seventeen years has been thoroughly exposed. Some textile enterprises and departments, whose leadership had been usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, have, after this thrilling class struggle, had their leadership seized back by the revolutionary masses. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is flourishing. After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination have made great progress. Many textile enterprises have established temporary power organs or preparatory groups for the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The entire textile industry system presents a scene of revolutionary fervor and high spirits.

	The conference discussed the current situation of the Cultural Revolution in the textile industry system and called on revolutionary mass organizations in units that have not yet achieved revolutionary great unity to resolutely follow the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao on achieving revolutionary great unity, enhance proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, and rapidly achieve revolutionary great unity by system and by industry; units that have already achieved revolutionary great unity should, on the basis of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity politically and ideologically. Representatives from Beijing Knitting Factory, Guiyang Cotton Textile Mill, Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 9, and Shanxi Red Guard Textile Mill introduced their experiences in consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity, implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and grasping the revolution and promoting production.

	The conference pointed out that the facts of more than a year of the Cultural Revolution have fully proved that the majority of cadres in the textile industry system are good or relatively good. Revolutionary masses must start from this basic fact, firmly support revolutionary cadres to come forward, boldly liberate cadres and boldly use cadres. Revolutionary cadres should also correctly treat revolutionary masses and mass movements, correct mistakes seriously, improve superior-subordinate relationships, and with a highly responsible attitude towards the Party and the people, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production. Units in the textile system should, with "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, further carry out a thorough criticism and rectification within the unit, carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and turn the textile industry system into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "must grasp cloth" is the greatest encouragement, greatest concern, greatest trust, and greatest spur for the textile industry system across the country. The representatives at the meeting studied Chairman Mao's great instructions and unanimously expressed their resolute support, resolute implementation, and resolute achievement. The representatives pointed out that with the victory of the Cultural Revolution, this year's cotton, hemp, wool, and silkworm cocoons and other textile raw materials have all been bountiful, providing a solid material foundation for the development of the textile industry. Revolutionary workers in the textile industry across the country must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, place the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, further carry out the ideological transformation of the people, fully tap production potential, do a good job in equipment maintenance, launch a mass technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and strive in every possible way to complete this year's production and construction tasks, and prepare good conditions for the further development of textile industry production and construction next year.

    全国纺织工业抓革命促生产会议要求广大革命职工紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署
    活学活用毛主席著作，以斗私批修为纲，增强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性，迅速实现按系统按行业的革命大联合；已经实现革命大联合的单位，要从政治上思想上加以巩固。要坚决支持革命干部站出来，大胆解放和使用干部，实现和巩固革命的三结合。要搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。乘无产阶级文化大革命大好形势，多快好省地完成纺织工业的生产建设任务。
    据新华社一日讯　最近在北京举行的全国纺织工业抓革命促生产工作会议，要求全国纺织工业的革命职工、革命干部，坚决、彻底地贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在革命的大批判中，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改，把纺织系统的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。会议要求全国纺织工业的革命职工，进一步贯彻执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大号召，乘无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势的东风，多快好省地完成生产建设任务，夺取革命和生产的双胜利！
    会议期间，来自各省、市、自治区纺织工业系统的无产阶级革命派、革命领导干部和在纺织工业系统担负支左支工任务的人民解放军的代表，认真地学习了伟大领袖毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的极为重要的最新指示，回顾了一年多来纺织工业系统无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程。大家认为，当前全国纺织工业系统的无产阶级文化大革命和生产建设，都面临着前所未有的大好形势。纺织工业战线的广大职工，从来没有象现在这样广泛深入地发动起来。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在纺织工业系统的代理人，十七年来在纺织工业系统推行的一套反革命修正主义货色，已经破产。曾经被党内一小撮走资派篡夺了领导权的某些纺织企业和部门，经过这场惊心动魄的阶级大搏斗，领导权已被夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。广大纺织工业职工活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，正在蓬勃开展。伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的号召以后，革命大联合和革命三结合有很大发展，许多纺织企业建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构或筹备小组。整个纺织工业系统呈现着一派热气腾腾、意气风发的革命景象。
    会议讨论了当前纺织工业系统的无产阶级文化大革命形势，号召还没有实现革命大联合的单位的革命群众组织，坚决遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于实行革命大联合的最新指示，增强无产阶级党性，克服小资产阶级派性，迅速实现按系统按行业的革命大联合；已经实现革命大联合的单位，要在斗私批修的基础上，进一步从政治上、思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合。北京针织总厂、贵阳棉纺织厂、青岛国棉九厂、山西红卫纺织厂等单位的代表，在会上介绍了他们巩固、发展革命大联合和实行革命三结合以及抓革命促生产的经验。
    会议指出，一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的事实充分证明，纺织工业系统的干部大多数是好的和比较好的。无产阶级革命派必须从这一基本事实出发，坚决支持革命的干部站出来，大胆地解放干部和大胆地使用干部。革命干部也要正确地对待革命群众和群众运动，犯了错误的要认真改正，要搞好上下级关系，以对党、对人民高度负责的精神，挑起革命和生产两副重担。纺织系统各单位应当以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把纺织工业系统办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出的“必须把布匹抓紧”的战斗号召，是对全国纺织系统职工的最大鼓舞，最大关怀，最大信任，最大鞭策。到会代表学习了毛主席的伟大指示，一致表示坚决拥护，坚决照办，坚决实现。代表们指出，随着文化大革命运动的胜利发展，今年棉花、麻类、羊毛和蚕茧等纺织原料，样样大丰收，为纺织工业的发展提供了雄厚的物质基础。全国纺织工业的革命职工，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，进一步搞好人的思想革命化，充分挖掘生产潜力，做好设备的维修工作，开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动，千方百计完成今年的生产建设任务，并为明年纺织工业生产建设的进一步发展准备下良好的条件。
