	KANGO, Dec. 23 (New China News Agency) — According to the broadcast of the Pathet Lao radio station: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front sent a telegram to the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam on the 18th, expressing the most enthusiastic congratulations on the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam.

	The telegram said, the Lao people will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the heroic people of South Vietnam to fight against the common enemy, American imperialism and its lackeys. The Lao people are determined to destroy more enemies and make contributions to support the struggle of their South Vietnamese brothers against American aggression for national salvation.

	The telegram enthusiastically praised the brilliant victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam over the past seven years.

	The telegram concluded by saying that the Lao people are deeply convinced that the just struggle of the people of South Vietnam against American aggression for national salvation will surely win, and American imperialism and its lackeys will surely suffer a shameful defeat.
