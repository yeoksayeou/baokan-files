According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 9th: The revolutionary workers and cadres of the Shanxi Hongwei Textile Mill, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, have resolutely implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp the revolution and promote production" and "must tightly grasp grain, cotton, and cloth." They completed the annual national production plan 25 days ahead of schedule, and the production cost has also been reduced compared to last year.

The completion of the annual production plan by the Hongwei Textile Mill ahead of schedule is the result of the entire factory's revolutionary workers and cadres seriously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions and striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They insisted on using revolution to lead production and promote it. They followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, held more than 180 large meetings, and set up numerous revolutionary criticism columns to deeply criticize the revisionist line of managing enterprises advocated by China's Khrushchev. Through the criticism, the broad revolutionary workers and cadres further established the idea of producing well for the revolution. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's instruction to "tightly grasp the production of cloth," and deeply understood that the completion of the production tasks of the textile industry is directly related to the lives of the people and to whether we can implement Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people." Therefore, they strictly enforced the eight-hour workday, insisted on revolutionary activities during leisure time, ensured attendance, and overcame difficulties in every possible way to make production better and better.

The broad revolutionary workers and cadres of the Hongwei Textile Mill also used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize the "experts managing the factory" line that had long dominated the factory, thoroughly broke the authority of bourgeois technical experts, and fully brought into play the wisdom of the working class. From January to November, the factory implemented 102 technological innovations, solved many long-standing problems, greatly increased labor productivity, and created more than 400,000 yuan of wealth for the state. They also sent people to rural areas and markets to gather opinions, improve machinery and equipment, and successfully developed more than 90 new varieties, which are deeply loved by the people.

　　坚决执行毛主席“必须把布匹抓紧”的指示
　　山西红卫纺织厂提前完成全年计划
    据新华社太原九日电  山西红卫纺织厂革命职工和革命干部，在驻厂人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，坚决贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“必须把粮食抓紧，必须把棉花抓紧，必须把布匹抓紧”的伟大指示，提前二十五天完成了全年国家生产计划，生产成本也比去年有所降低。
    红卫纺织厂提前完成全年生产计划，是全厂革命职工、革命干部在无产阶级文化大革命中认真贯彻毛主席的指示，努力活学活用毛主席著作的成果。他们坚持以革命统帅生产，推动生产。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，先后召开一百八十多次大会，举办不少革命大批判专栏，对中国赫鲁晓夫推行的一套修正主义办企业路线进行了深入的批判。广大革命职工和革命干部通过大批判，进一步树立了为革命搞好生产的思想。他们认真学习了毛主席“必须把布匹抓紧”的指示，更加深刻地体会到纺织工业生产任务完成得好坏，直接关系到人民的生活，关系到能不能贯彻执行毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，因此，他们严格实行八小时工作制，坚持业余闹革命，保证出勤率，千方百计战胜困难，把生产搞得好上加好。
    红卫纺织厂广大革命职工和革命干部，还以毛泽东思想为武器，批判了多年来统治工厂的“专家治厂”路线，大破资产阶级技术权威，充分发挥了工人阶级的聪明才智。一至十一月份，这个厂实现了一百零二项技术革新，解决了许多过去长期得不到解决的问题，大大提高了劳动生产率，为国家创造了四十多万元的财富。他们还派人深入农村、市场，征求意见，改进机器设备，试制成功了九十多种新品种，深受群众欢迎。
