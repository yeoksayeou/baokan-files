Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the conferring of the title "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" upon Comrade Li Wenzhong. This is the greatest honor Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin have bestowed upon him. For me, as his family member, it is also the greatest encouragement and motivation. I must be like Wenzhong, always loving Chairman Mao, always loyal to Chairman Mao. "Even if my head is chopped off, it doesn't matter, as long as the cause is true. Defending Chairman Mao, even if I die, I am willing."

In these past few days, I have repeatedly recalled many touching incidents involving Wenzhong. Though he only lived for twenty-five short years, his entire life was one of boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, of boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He achieved this: "If Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; if Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; if Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow; if Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance." Though he sacrificed himself for the people, his spirit of boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao will forever live in my heart, forever live in the hearts of the people of the entire nation, forever live in the hearts of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people around the world.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the mark of class." Wenzhong was born into a poor peasant family. He was born in bitterness and grew up in sweetness, loving Chairman Mao from a young age and listening to Chairman Mao's words. After joining the army, Wenzhong studied Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, growing rapidly under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought into a brand-new communist and a good soldier of Chairman Mao. The songs Wenzhong loved to sing the most were "The East Is Red," "The Sailor on the Boundless Ocean Depends on the Helm," and "The Soldiers of Chairman Mao Obey the Party's Words"; the books he loved to read the most were Chairman Mao's works; the words he loved to say the most were "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." Last autumn, when Wenzhong was passing through his hometown on a business trip, he saw his fellow villagers and said to them, "I have a piece of great news to report to you: our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao has once again received one hundred and fifty thousand revolutionary youngsters in Beijing. Chairman Mao's health is extremely good. This is the greatest happiness for the people of the entire nation! It is also the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the entire world!" As he spoke, he and the villagers enthusiastically shouted together, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Once, I took our one-year-old child to the army to visit Wenzhong. He held the child in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and repeatedly taught the child to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" He said to the child in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, "Child, without Chairman Mao, there would be no father for you. You must love Chairman Mao from a young age." Wenzhong's feelings for Chairman Mao were deeper than the sea and higher than the mountains. He lived to fight for the defense of Chairman Mao and died to sacrifice himself for the defense of Chairman Mao. In his mind, he established the absolute authority of Chairman Mao.

"Regarding Marxist theory, one must be able to master it and apply it; the purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Wenzhong firmly remembered this teaching of our great leader Chairman Mao, always insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, combining study with practice, and seeing immediate results. In 1962, I heard that the Kuomintang bandits were going to invade the mainland, so I went to the army to see him. He saw my thoughts and studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with me, telling the story of Zhang Side serving the people wholeheartedly, and using Chairman Mao's words to enlighten me. He also said, "Revolution means not being afraid to die. If you are afraid to die, you cannot revolutionize. Dying for the people's interests is the greatest glory for a revolutionary soldier." Wenzhong's help greatly educated and inspired me. At that time, the work of preparing for war was very busy, and I only stayed in the company for two hours before he sent me away. In 1965, I went to the army to see Wenzhong. At that time, the situation in Vietnam was very tense, and the American imperialists were killing and burning there, and were also escalating the war. Wenzhong was very concerned about the situation in Vietnam and every day brought newspapers back to the dormitory to show me. He often opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read to me word by word, "The people who have already won the revolution should support the struggle of the people who are fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." He also took out a world map and said to me, "We have been liberated and are living a happy life, but we must not forget that there are still many class brothers suffering in the world. Our duty is to support and aid the liberation of all oppressed and enslaved peoples in the world, and to plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world. We are soldiers of Chairman Mao, and we obey Chairman Mao's words the most. As long as Chairman Mao gives the order, I will rush to the place Chairman Mao points to, and I will not hesitate to brave fire and water."

Wenzhong always followed Chairman Mao's teachings about "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people" and strictly required himself, always breathing and sharing fate with the soldiers, and maintaining good relations between superiors and subordinates. On the evening of the Spring Festival in 1967, Wenzhong returned from studying in the company, and it was already past nine o'clock. He was going to stand guard. I asked, "Is it the fourth platoon standing guard?" He said, "No, it's another platoon." I said, "No, whose place are you taking?" He said, "We are here to serve the people. Standing guard is not about this platoon or that platoon, not about cadres, soldiers, or time." He took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read to me, "All the people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." He said to me, "Tonight is the Spring Festival, and cadres should care for every soldier even more." Wenzhong went out for a short while and was pushed back by the soldiers, who would not let him stand guard. But after the soldiers left, Wenzhong quietly went to stand guard. Soldiers and cadres caring for each other and loving each other fully embodied the glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers.

"Thousands upon thousands of martyrs sacrificed themselves for the people's interests in front of us, bravely. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their bloodstained path!"

### 象李文忠那样，永远忠于毛主席

　　象李文忠那样，永远忠于毛主席
　　“支左爱民模范”李文忠烈士的爱人　王邦敏
    我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准授予李文忠同志以“支左爱民模范”的光荣称号，这是毛主席和林副主席给他的最大荣誉，对于我，作为他的亲人，也是最大的鞭策和鼓励。我一定要象文忠那样，永远热爱毛主席，永远忠于毛主席，“砍头不要紧，只要主义真，保卫毛主席，死了也甘心。”
    这些天以来，我一次又一次地回忆起文忠许多感人的事。他虽然只活了短短的二十五年，但是，他的一生是无限忠于毛主席的一生，是无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一生，他做到了：“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”他虽然为人民牺牲了，但他无限忠于毛主席的精神，将永远活在我的心里，永远活在全国人民的心里，永远活在全世界亿万革命人民的心里。
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印”。文忠出生在一个贫苦农民的家庭。他苦水里生，甜水里长，从小就热爱毛主席，听毛主席的话。到了部队以后，文忠更加刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，迅速地成长为一个崭新的共产主义新人，毛主席的好战士。文忠最爱唱的歌，是《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和《毛主席的战士最听党的话》；最爱读的书，是毛主席著作；最爱说的话，是“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”去年秋后，文忠出差路过家乡，见到乡亲们，第一句话就说：“我向乡亲们报告一个最大的喜讯，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，在北京又一次接见了一百五十万革命小将，毛主席的身体非常非常健康，这是全国人民最大的幸福！也是全世界革命人民最大的幸福！”文忠一边讲，一边和乡亲们万分激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！！”
    有一次，我抱着一岁多的孩子去部队看文忠，他把孩子抱到毛主席像前，一遍又一遍地教孩子喊“毛主席万岁！”他对着毛主席像对孩子说：“孩子，没有毛主席，就没有你的爸爸，你要从小热爱毛主席。”文忠对毛主席的感情比海还深，比山还高，他生为保卫毛主席而战斗，死为保卫毛主席而献身，在他脑子里树立了毛主席的绝对权威。
      “对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”文忠牢记伟大领袖毛主席这一教导，始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，学用结合，立竿见影。一九六二年，我听说蒋介石匪帮要窜犯大陆，便到部队里看他。他看出我的心思，就和我一起学习《为人民服务》，讲张思德全心全意为人民服务的故事，用毛主席的话开导我。他还说：“革命就不能怕死，怕死就不能革命。为人民利益而死，对革命战士来说，是最大的光荣。”文忠的帮助使我受到了很大的教育和鼓舞。当时，战备工作很忙，我在连队只呆了两个小时，他就把我送走了。一九六五年，我去部队看文忠。当时越南形势很紧张，美帝国主义在那里杀人放火，还搞什么战争“升级”。文忠对越南的形势非常关心，每天把报纸拿回宿舍给我看。他经常打开《毛主席语录》，一字字地念给我听：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”并且拿出一张世界地图对我说：“咱们解放了，过上了幸福的生活，但是我们不能忘记世界上还有很多阶级兄弟在受苦受难。我们的义务，是支持和援助世界上所有被压迫被奴役的人民获得解放，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全世界。我们是毛主席的战士，最听毛主席的话，只要毛主席一声令下，我就奔向毛主席指引的地方，赴汤蹈火，在所不惜。”
    文忠始终遵照毛主席关于“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，严格要求自己，时时和战士们同呼吸，共命运，上下级关系搞得很好。一九六七年的春节晚上，文忠从连队学习回来，已经九点多了，他要去站岗。我问：“是四排站岗吗？”他说：“不是，是别的排。”我说：“不是，你代谁站岗？”他说：“我们是为人民服务的，站岗不分这排那排，不分干部、战士和时间。”他又拿出《毛主席语录》给我念了一段：“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”并对我说：“今晚是春节，干部更应该关心每一个战士。”文忠出去不久，就被战士推回来了，说什么也不让他站。但是战士走后，文忠又悄悄地去执勤。战士、干部互相关心，互相爱护，充分体现了官兵一致的光荣传统。
    “成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”
