One should conduct self-criticism if one has made mistakes. Do not always assume that you are right, as if all truth is in your hands. Do not always think that only you are capable, and that others are incapable, as if the world would stop without you.

Chairman Mao's latest directive points out a clear direction for conducting study classes. It emphasizes theory linked to practice, conducting self-criticism, and further promoting ideological revolutionization, developing and consolidating the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 24th, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres across the country have repeatedly studied the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive on conducting serious self-criticism. They said that Chairman Mao's latest directive is of great significance for conducting study classes on Mao Zedong Thought and for promoting the victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must deeply understand and implement it without any deviation.

The Power of Chairman Mao's Latest Directive

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The two sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes. Let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes. Each side should conduct more self-criticism, seek common ground while reserving differences."

Revolutionary cadres and broad masses of revolutionaries across the country have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directive, conducted serious self-criticism, and fought against the "self" in their minds. They have carried out revolution in the depths of their souls, further developing and consolidating the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination. Many vivid examples have shown the boundless power of Chairman Mao's latest directive.

Beijing Silk Factory is one of the few units in Beijing's factories and mines that have not achieved the great alliance of revolution. After the publication of the editorial in the People's Daily on the 22nd, the leaders of the two factions at the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress study class acted decisively according to Chairman Mao's latest directive, conducting more self-criticism, and quickly resolved the old and difficult problem that hindered the great alliance of revolution. The factory achieved the great alliance of revolution on the same day.

The students at the Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the preparatory committee of the Revolutionary Committee of Henan Province and the Provincial Military Region Party Committee immediately held a sharing session after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive. At the sharing session, some checked their past "unique revolution," "suppressing others with power," and "arrogance." Some checked their past situation of being deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line. Both sides expressed that they would better implement Chairman Mao's latest directive in the future, adhere to the spirit of conducting more self-criticism, use a microscope to examine their own shortcomings, and look more at the strengths of the other side. This is to further eliminate differences and promote organizational and ideological great alliances of revolution.

Two female workers at Guangzhou's First Cotton Mill used to participate in two different factions with different viewpoints and could not sit together or talk together. After studying Chairman Mao's latest directive, they shared their true feelings with each other, conducted sincere self-examinations, and finally became a "red pair." They expressed that they would help each other better in the future, advance together, and achieve new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Conduct Self-Criticism, Follow Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not always assume that you are right, as if all truth is in your hands. Do not always think that only you are capable, and that others are incapable, as if the world would stop without you."

Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the country deeply feel that Chairman Mao's extremely profound and sincere teachings point out the only correct attitude towards the masses and towards oneself. Only by correctly treating the masses and correctly treating oneself, and conducting more self-criticism when one has made mistakes, can we better implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

The leaders of the two factions of revolutionary masses at Wuhan Meat Processing Plant, which is holding a revolutionary workers' congress, have deeply felt that we can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, establish a workers' congress, and achieve the great alliance of revolution. This is the result of acting according to Chairman Mao's teaching of "each side conducting more self-criticism." This plant's two factions of revolutionary masses have been fighting "internal wars" for a long time. They have talked about unity three times, but because both sides always exposed each other's wounds and attacked each other, all three talks broke down. The masses called the leaders of the two factions a "pair of failures." Later, at the Mao Zedong Thought study class jointly held by the two factions of revolutionary masses, because both sides lacked the sincerity to conduct more self-criticism, they instead prepared enough "ammunition" to attack the other side and severely criticize the opponent. The unity issue still could not be resolved. Recently, with the help of the PLA comrades, the leaders of the two factions repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest directive, conducted more self-criticism, exposed their own "self," and fought against it. As a result, the more they fought against their "self," the closer they became, and the more they fought against their "self," the more united they became. This finally promoted the achievement of the great alliance of revolution in the entire factory according to workshops, workshops, and departments. Revolutionary masses happily said that the leaders of the two factions in their factory have changed from a "pair of failures" to a "red pair."

The five mass organizations at Guangzhou Lighter Factory had a long dispute over seat allocation during the discussion on achieving the great alliance of revolution. One said, "We rebelled early and have strong revolutionary spirit, so we should have more seats." Another said, "We follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step, so this seat should be given to us." Later, everyone studied Chairman Mao's teachings repeatedly in the study class, fought against the "self," conducted more self-criticism, and spoke less about others' shortcomings while looking more at others' strengths. As a result, the situation completely changed. Some said, "Your organization is large and has many talents, so you should have more seats!" Others said, "You have more young people who dare to speak and act, and have good revolutionary spirit, so you should have more seats!" Everyone changed from competing for seats to yielding seats to each other, quickly achieving the great alliance of revolution, and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Conduct Self-Criticism, Be a Thorough Proletarian Revolutionary

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "If one has made mistakes, one should conduct self-criticism." "Whether or not there is serious self-criticism is also one of the distinctive marks that distinguish us from other parties."

The leaders of the two factions of mass organizations at the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress study class held by the Beijing Machinery Repair Factory of the Chemical Industry Bureau, after achieving the great alliance of revolution, further acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, "each side conducting more self-criticism," fighting against the "self," and carrying out the "one helps one, one pair of red" activity. They have made new contributions to consolidating and developing the great alliance of revolution in their factory. They deeply felt that whether or not there is serious self-criticism, and whether or not one can use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" in one's mind, is the touchstone for distinguishing a proletarian revolutionary from a petty-bourgeois revolutionary. Conducting serious self-criticism is the key to studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and is the key to self-education by the masses, carrying out revolution in the depths of their souls, and helping each other, learning from each other, consolidating the great alliance of revolution, and promoting the three-in-one combination. They said, conducting one serious self-criticism is a victory in linking theory with practice and actively launching an offensive against the "self." They expressed that they would forever study and apply Chairman Mao's works, consciously carry out revolution, and revolutionize to the end, being good workers of Chairman Mao for life.

The leaders of various mass organizations at the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Revolutionary Workers' Great Alliance Negotiation Representatives Conference in the Xi'an region said during the study of Chairman Mao's latest directive that several of our workers' mass organizations once split and fought "internal wars," and could not unite. One of the important reasons was that we could not conduct serious self-criticism. In the study class, with the help of the PLA comrades, they brought problems to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, "each side conducting more self-criticism," and further consolidated and developed the great alliance of revolution in terms of ideology. They said, Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "Revolution also means revolutionizing oneself. Without revolutionizing oneself, the revolution cannot be carried out well." We must change the objective world while changing the subjective world and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We must not cover up our own mistakes and exaggerate others' mistakes.

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses across the country have expressed after studying Chairman Mao's latest directive that to conduct serious rather than perfunctory self-criticism, one must not lightly describe or cover up one's own mistakes and shortcomings; one must help others benevolently and must not exaggerate others' mistakes. The students at the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang Normal College deeply felt that if one only criticizes others, the more one criticizes, the more opposed one becomes; only by conducting more self-criticism can one promote each other and strengthen unity. When the Shanghai Sugar, Tobacco, and Alcohol Company in Zhabei District began to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, both sides did not conduct self-criticism, and even if they conducted a little self-criticism, it was cautious and defensive, while criticizing others harshly and attacking them. As a result, the more they studied, the less confident they became, the more they studied, the more angry they became, and both sides wanted to go back. Later, everyone seriously studied Chairman Mao's works and latest directive, conducted serious self-criticism, talked more enthusiastically, became more excited, and gained more confidence, quickly achieving the great alliance of revolution. The revolutionary masses of this company said that conducting serious rather than perfunctory self-criticism is indeed a key issue in conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

    自己有了错误，要作自我批评。
    不要总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里。不要总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了。					毛泽东
    毛主席最新指示为大力办好学习班指出明确方向
    理论联系实际　多做自我批评
    进一步促进思想革命化、发展巩固革命大联合和三结合
    据新华社二十四日讯　全国无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，反复学习伟大领袖毛主席关于进行认真的自我批评的最新指示，受到了极大的教育。他们说，毛主席的最新指示对于办好毛泽东思想学习班，推进无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，具有极其重大的意义，我们一定要深刻领会，不折不扣地贯彻执行。
        毛主席的最新指示威力无穷
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”
    各地无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，反复学习毛主席的最新指示，认真开展自我批评，狠斗头脑中的“私”字，在自己灵魂深处闹革命，进一步发展和巩固了革命大联合和革命三结合。许许多多生动的事例，显示了毛主席最新指示的无穷威力。
    北京丝绸厂是北京市厂矿企业中极少数没有实现革命大联合的单位之一。《人民日报》二十二日社论发表以后，两派负责人在北京市工代会学习班上，坚决按照毛主席的最新指示办事，各自多做自我批评，很快解决了妨碍革命大联合的老大难问题。这个厂当天就实现了革命的大联合。
    正在河南省革命委员会筹备小组和省军区党委举办的毛泽东思想学习班学习的学员们，学习了毛主席的最新指示，立即联合召开了讲用会。在讲用会上，有的检查了自己前一阶段存在的“唯我独革”、“以势压人”、“骄傲自大”等缺点，有的检查了自己过去一段受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的情况。会上，双方都表示今后要更好地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，本着多作自我批评的精神，用显微镜看自己的缺点，多看对方的长处，以便进一步消除分歧，促进组织上和思想上的革命大联合。
    广州第一棉纺厂有两位女工，过去参加了不同观点的两派组织，坐不到一起，谈不在一块。经过学习毛主席的最新指示以后，她们相互把心里话都掏给对方，互相作了恳切的自我检查，终于结成了“一对红”。她们表示，今后要更好地互相帮助，共同前进，在无产阶级文化大革命中为人民立新功。
  多做自我批评，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“不要总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里。不要总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了。”
    各地革命群众和革命干部深深地体会到，毛主席这一极其深刻、极其恳切的教导，给我们指出了正确对待群众和正确对待自己的唯一正确态度。我们只有正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，自己有了错误就多作自我批评，才能更好地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    武汉肉类联合加工厂正在召开革命工代会。这个厂的两派革命群众组织负责人深有体会地说，我们能够紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，成立工代会，实现革命大联合，是遵照毛主席“各自多做自我批评”的教导办事的结果。这个厂两派革命群众组织过去长期打“内战”，三次谈联合，都因为双方总是互揭疮疤，互相攻击，三次都谈崩了，群众把两派组织的负责人称为“一对崩”。后来，在两派革命群众组织联合举办的毛泽东思想学习班上，又因为双方都没有多作自我批评的诚意，相反地却准备了足够的“炮弹”专轰别人，狠整对方，联合问题还是不能解决。最近，两派组织负责人在解放军同志的帮助下，反复学习毛主席的最新指示，各自多做自我批评，自己的私自己亮，自己斗，结果，越斗私双方越亲，越斗私互相之间越团结，终于促进全厂实现了按班组、按车间、按部门的革命大联合。革命群众高兴地说，他们厂的两派负责人，已经由“一对崩”变成“一对红”了。
    广州打火机厂的五个群众组织，在商谈实现革命大联合的过程中，曾经为席位分配问题争执很久。这个说：“我们造反早，造反精神强，应该多占一个席位。”那个说：“我们步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，这个席位应该给我们。”后来，大家在学习班里反复学习毛主席的教导，狠斗私字，多作自我批评，少讲别人的短处，多看别人的长处，结果情况完全变了。有的说：“你们组织大，人材多，你们就多占一个席位吧！”有的说：“你们青年人多，敢说敢干，革命精神好，还是你们多占一个席位吧！”大家由互争席位变为互让席位，很快实现革命大联合，紧紧跟上了毛主席的伟大战略部署。
  多做自我批评，做彻底的无产阶级革命派
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“自己有了错误，要作自我批评。”“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”
    参加北京市工代会举办的毛泽东思想学习班的化工部北京施工机械修造厂的两派群众组织负责人，在实现革命大联合以后，进一步遵照毛主席的教导，“各自多做自我批评”，狠斗“私”字，开展“一帮一、一对红”活动，为巩固和发展本厂的革命大联合作出了新贡献。他们深刻地体会到，有无认真的自我批评，能不能用毛泽东思想来狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，是区分无产阶级革命派还是小资产阶级革命派的试金石。认真地作自我批评，是活学活用毛主席著作、办好毛泽东思想学习班的关键，是群众自己教育自己，在灵魂深处爆发革命的关键，也是互相帮助、互相学习、巩固革命大联合、促进革命三结合的关键。他们说，作一次认真的自我批评，就是理论联系实际，对“私”字主动开展进攻战的一次胜利。他们表示，要永远活学活用毛主席著作，自觉革命，革命到底，一辈子做毛主席的好工人。
    正在西安地区革命工人大联合协商代表会毛泽东思想学习班学习的各群众组织负责人，在学习毛主席最新指示时说，我们几个工人群众组织，曾一度闹分裂，打“内战”，联合不起来，重要的原因之一就是不能认真地进行自我批评。在学习班里，他们在解放军同志的帮助下，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，“各自多做自我批评”，从思想上进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合。他们说，林副主席指出：“革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”我们一定要在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。对自己决不文过饰非，对同志决不无限上纲
    各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众，学习了毛主席的最新指示以后纷纷表示，为了实行认真的而不是敷衍的自我批评，对自己的错误和缺点决不能轻描淡写，文过饰非；对别人的错误和缺点一定要善意地帮助，决不能倾盆大雨，无限上纲。在贵阳师范学院革命委员会毛泽东思想学习班学习的学员深有体会地说，如果光指责别人，越批评就越对立；只有多作自我批评，才能互相促进，加强团结。上海市闸北区糖业烟酒公司开始举办毛泽东思想学习班的时候，双方都不作自我批评，即使作一点自我批评，也是小心翼翼，处处设防，而对别人却横加指责，进行攻击，结果越学越没有信心，越学越有气，都闹着要回去。后来，大家认真地学习了毛主席著作和最新指示，认真开展自我批评，越谈越有劲，越谈越激动，越谈越有信心，很快实现了革命的大联合。这个公司的革命群众说，实行认真的而不是敷衍的自我批评，确实是办好毛泽东思想学习班的一个关键问题。
