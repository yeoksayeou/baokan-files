The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions to struggle against self and criticize revisionism have resonated like a spring thunder in the Mingzhu Brigade of Tunli Commune in Jishi County, Shanxi. While holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the brigade has also extensively carried out struggle against self and criticism of revisionism activities in the homes of its members, determined to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position.

Currently, the family struggle against self and criticism of revisionism activities in this brigade have already shown immediate effects. Families often gather to study Chairman Mao's works and recite Chairman Mao's quotations. The elderly often tell the younger generation about family and village history, conducting class education. Poor and lower-middle peasants and community members, following Chairman Mao's instructions, examine their own thoughts, decide their actions according to Chairman Mao's words, and at the same time, severely criticize the heinous crimes of Chinese Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism. The spiritual outlook of the broad masses of community members has undergone tremendous changes.

　　明珠大队广泛开展家庭斗私批修活动
    伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修的最新指示，象一声春雷，在山西吉县屯里公社明珠大队激起了强烈的反响。这个大队在举办毛泽东思想学习班的同时，在社员家庭中广泛开展了斗私批修活动，决心让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    目前，这个大队开展的家庭斗私批修活动已经起到了立竿见影的效果。一家老小经常在一起学习毛主席著作，背毛主席语录。老人经常给青年人讲家史村史，进行阶级教育。贫下中农和社员群众根据毛主席的指示对照检查自己的思想，按照毛主席的话来决定自己的行动，同时狠批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。广大社员的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。
