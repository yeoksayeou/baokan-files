With the revolutionary farmers of the Nasalbari region as their example, farmers in eastern India have taken up arms to seize land.

New Delhi, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) — In some areas of Assam and the centrally administered territory of Tripura in eastern India, there have recently been struggles by farmers to seize land.

The Indian reactionary authorities have hastily dispatched troops and police to suppress these struggles.

According to Indian newspapers, in the districts of Barakshimpur and Nowgaon in Assam, landless farmers, inspired by the revolutionary farmers of the Nasalbari region in West Bengal, have risen up to seize land usurped by landlords and the reactionary government. In some areas, farmers have taken up arms to seize land.

The Indian reactionary newspaper "The Hindustan Times" said: "These are not isolated incidents; it seems that they are being directed by some organized body." It further said that it is possible that the revolutionaries who led the armed struggle of the Nasalbari farmers are supporting these struggles.

The Assam government has ordered local authorities in the affected districts to take "strict measures" to suppress the farmers' movement. Local authorities have begun arresting farmers who have seized land.

Indian newspapers also reported that in the centrally administered territory of Tripura, south of Assam, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India has been mobilizing farmers to seize land over the past eight months, especially since the establishment of the armed struggle area in Nasalbari. They have been particularly active in the densely forested mountainous areas. In the Demba area, landless farmers, with the support of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have seized back a large amount of land usurped by the reactionary government. The situation has made the local reactionary ruler, the Chief Commissioner of Tripura, very anxious. He has already appealed to the central government for help.

In addition, Indian Home Minister Chavan recently acknowledged in parliament that farmers' struggles are developing in some counties in northern Bihar.

　　以纳萨尔巴里地区革命农民为榜样
    印度东部地区农民拿起武器进行夺地斗争
    新华社十五日讯　新德里消息：在印度东部的阿萨姆邦和中央直属领地特里普拉的一些地区，最近发生了农民夺取土地的斗争。
    印度反动派慌忙派军警前往镇压。
    据印度报纸报道，在阿萨姆邦的比拉克希姆普尔县和瑙冈县，斗志昂扬的无地农民，按照西孟加拉邦纳萨尔巴里地区革命农民的榜样，奋起夺取地主和反动政府侵占的土地。在一些地区，农民是武装起来进行夺地斗争的。
    印度反动报纸《印度斯坦旗报》说：“这些不是孤立的事件，看来是得到某个有组织的机构的指挥。”它还进一步说，可能是领导纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争的革命者正在支持这些斗争。
    阿萨姆邦政府已经下令有关地区的县当局采取“严厉措施”去镇压农民运动。县当局已经开始逮捕夺地农民。
    印度报纸还报道，在这个邦以南的中央直属领地特里普拉，印共革命派在过去八个月左右，特别是在纳萨尔巴里武装斗争地区建立后，一直在发动农民进行夺地斗争。他们在丛林密布的山区特别活跃。在德姆杰地区，无地农民在印共革命派的支持下夺回了大批被反动政府侵占的土地。形势已经使当地反动统治的头子、特里普拉首席专员十分惊慌。他已经向中央政府告急。
    此外，印度内政部长恰范最近在议会中讲话时承认，在比哈尔邦北部的一些县，农民斗争正在发展中。
