Chairman Mao teaches us: "The result of the struggle between two opposing sides is that they transform into each other under certain conditions. Here, the conditions are important. Without certain conditions, the struggling sides will not transform."

In the Huainan region, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the great People's Liberation Army, and the broad revolutionary masses are the fundamental conditions for winning this struggle, and the decisive factors for the increasingly good situation in Huainan.

How to quickly spread Chairman Mao's great voice throughout Huainan has been a sharp and complex struggle from the beginning. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao has issued a series of important instructions to guide the cultural revolution in Anhui and Huainan. However, these instructions were blocked and resisted by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and were interfered with from the right and the "ultra-left" sides, and were not well implemented among the broad revolutionary masses. What should we do? At this critical moment, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally dispatched the 6408 Unit to Huainan to carry out the task of supporting the left.

"The troops of Chairman Mao have come!" "The troops of Chairman Mao have come!" This good news thundered across the Jianghuai region like spring thunder.

The 6408 Unit, which is loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, arrived in Huainan and immediately, with a revolutionary spirit of seizing the day, launched an unprecedented large-scale campaign to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Hundreds of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entered every mine, every workshop, every street, and every household, widely propagating Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, quickly spreading Chairman Mao's voice throughout Huainan.

When the broad revolutionary masses heard the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, many people said with tears of joy: "In the past, the bad elements here distorted and blocked the news, and we rarely heard Chairman Mao's voice. Now that we have heard Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must follow them step by step and carry them out sentence by sentence."

Wherever there are masses, wherever there are difficulties, wherever there are problems, the supporting-left troops go to propagate. No matter what emergencies they encounter, they always stand up with great courage, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to educate the masses, persuade the masses, and promote the unity of the working class.

One day, two factions faced off at Jiu Long Gang. At this moment, we saw squad after squad of PLA soldiers, with the most calm and composed attitude, holding hands to build a Great Wall between the two sides. They held high red flags, held high portraits of Chairman Mao, waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and with the deepest class feelings, propagated Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's policies to the two factions. Slogans of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and songs of Mao's quotations echoed through the skies. The soldiers' loyalty to Chairman Mao, their deep affection for the masses, deeply moved many people. Many people tightly grasped the hands of the PLA soldiers and said: "You are truly good soldiers of Chairman Mao!" "You are truly our kin!" "Only the good soldiers educated by Chairman Mao can propagate Mao Zedong Thought without a moment's relaxation and care so much about our unity!"

It is this army, these soldiers, who, for the sake of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, work day and night with the revolutionary masses of Huainan, study together, live together, and have forged a bond of flesh and blood with the revolutionary people, and have performed new deeds in eliminating the estrangement between revolutionary mass organizations and promoting their unity.

"Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." As soon as the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction was published in the newspapers, the 6408 Unit immediately launched extensive and in-depth propaganda in the Huainan mining area.

The working class of Huainan, who have learned from the lessons of division, under the enthusiastic help of the PLA comrades, deeply understood Chairman Mao's latest instructions and resolutely carried them out. They followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and took the lead in the great alliance of revolution.

However, to promote the great alliance of the entire mining area, there are still difficulties ahead, and it is necessary to persuade and educate, and to do a lot of patient and detailed ideological and political work.

Some people said: Some issues have not been clarified, and we cannot unite!

The workers said: If we do not unite, the issues will not be clarified, and the more we clarify, the less clear they will be. After uniting, the issues will be clearer.

Some people said: Some bad elements have not been exposed, and we cannot unite!

The workers said: If we do not unite, the bad elements will have small mountains to protect them. If we unite, the bad elements will not be able to escape.

Some people said: Different viewpoints cannot unite!

The workers said: We workers have only one viewpoint: the viewpoint of Mao Zedong Thought! After uniting, there will still be different opinions, but as long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, we can solve them through criticism and self-criticism.

The power of example is boundless. The working class of Huainan coal mines united, and effectively resisted the impact of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, uniting all revolutionary forces around them, becoming the backbone of the proletarian revolutionary forces in the entire city. Their model actions finally promoted the great alliance of the entire city by system, by industry, and by class.

"Fight self, criticize revisionism," overcome factionalism, is the fundamental way to consolidate the great alliance. After implementing the great alliance, the coal mines of Xiejiaji and Li Yi, initially only organizationally eliminated the small mountains, but ideologically, it was still "self" first, factionalism first, resulting in a situation of outward unity but inward division. The PLA comrades, in response to this situation, helped the revolutionary workers, taking "fight self, criticize revisionism" as the guideline, combined with the study of the "Three Old Articles" and the conduct of self-criticism, launched a great discussion throughout the mine to establish great proletarian party spirit and break down bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism.

The great discussion opened everyone's hearts, and many workers said: "Factionalism, factionalism, truth is not clear"; "If factionalism is not eliminated, internal strife will not stop." Everyone, on the basis of studying Mao Zedong Thought, proposed the slogan "Leaders who engage in factionalism, the masses resist; a few people who engage in factionalism, the majority resist," launching a mass activity to resist factionalism, achieving the effect of not bringing factionalist viewpoints to meetings, not engaging in factionalist activities in production, and not praising good people and good deeds from a factionalist perspective, making the entire mine full of a new scene of unity and progress.

The 6408 Unit firmly followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," relying closely on the revolutionary masses and the proletarian revolutionary cadres, consulting with the masses on every matter, and being the students of the masses. They attached importance to investigation and study, using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and judge everything. Whatever is in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, they support and support; whatever is not in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, they oppose and resist.

Facing the two factions of revolutionary masses in Huainan, the comrades of the 6408 Unit insisted on the principle of supporting the left without supporting the factions, and never partially supported one side and attacked the other side among the revolutionary mass organizations. The army did this, and initially, some people did not understand, saying they were muddling through and the banner was not clear. After a period of practice, the broad revolutionary masses realized: Only by correctly handling revolutionary mass organizations in accordance with the principles of Mao Zedong Thought can Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line be truly implemented, which is beneficial to promoting the two factions to unite on the basis of revolutionary principles. Many workers in the Yangyang District said: The army did this, which is precisely to uphold proletarian party spirit, avoid bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and guide the masses to advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the Huainan mining area, the 6408 Unit always regarded the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental task of supporting the left. They quickly conveyed Chairman Mao's various latest instructions to the masses and directly met with the masses. They assisted the masses in setting up more than 2,800 Mao Zedong Thought study classes in a short period, guiding the masses to strictly follow Mao Zedong Thought to recognize and solve problems. Their practice proved: As long as the masses truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can smash the sabotage plots of the class enemies, eliminate the interference of factionalism, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    战地黄花分外香
    ——六四○八部队在淮南为人民立新功
    毛主席教导我们：“矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。在这里，条件是重要的。没有一定的条件，斗争着的双方都不会转化。”
    在淮南地区，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，战无不胜的毛泽东思想、伟大的中国人民解放军和广大革命群众，就是夺得这场斗争胜利的最根本条件，就是淮南形势越来越好的决定性的因素。
    怎样把毛主席的伟大声音迅速传遍淮南，自始至终是一场尖锐复杂的斗争。无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部，对指导安徽和淮南的文化大革命运动，发出了一系列的重要指示。但是，这些指示，在淮南受到了党内一小撮走资派的封锁和抵制，受到来自右的和极“左”方面的干扰，一直没有在广大革命群众中得到很好的贯彻。怎么办呢？正在这个关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席亲自派六四○八部队，到淮南执行支左任务。
      “毛主席的部队来了！”“毛主席的部队来了！”这个喜讯，象春雷震动着江淮大地。
    忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的六四○八部队，一到淮南，就以只争朝夕的革命精神，掀起了空前规模的宣传毛泽东思想的运动。成百的毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到每一个矿井、每一个车间、每一条街道、每一个家庭，广泛宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的最新指示，把毛主席的声音最迅速地传遍了全淮南。
    当广大革命群众听到伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示时，许多群众含着热泪说：“过去这里的坏人歪曲和封锁消息，我们很少听到毛主席的声音。如今听到了毛主席的最新指示，我们一定要步步紧跟，句句照办。”
    那里有群众，那里有困难，那里有问题，支左部队就到那里去宣传。不论遇到任何紧急情况，他们总以大无畏的英雄气概，挺身而出，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，教育群众，说服群众，促进工人阶级的团结。
    有一天，两大派在九龙岗发生了对峙。这时，只见一队队解放军战士，以最沉着、最镇定的态度，手挽着手在两方之间筑起了一道长城。他们高擎红旗，高举毛主席画像，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，以最深厚的阶级感情，对两大派宣传毛主席的指示，宣传党的政策。“毛主席万岁”口号声，毛主席语录歌声，激荡着云空。战士们忠于毛主席的坚贞品质，热爱群众的深厚感情，使很多群众深深感动了。许多人紧握着解放军战士的手说：“你们真是毛主席的好战士！”“你们真是俺们的亲人哪！”“只有毛主席教育出来的好战士，才能一分一秒不放松宣传毛泽东思想，才能这样关心我们的团结！”
    就是这样的军队，就是这样的战士，为贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，日日夜夜和淮南的革命群众，劳动在一起，学习在一起，生活在一起，和革命人民结下了血肉相连的情谊，为消除革命群众组织之间的隔阂，促进他们的团结，立下了新功。
    “在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”伟大领袖毛主席这个最新指示刚在报纸上发表，六四○八部队立即在淮南矿区展开了广泛深入的宣传。
    经受分裂教训的淮南工人阶级，在解放军同志的热忱帮助下，深刻领会了毛主席的最新指示，他们坚决照办，认真执行。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，走在革命大联合的最前头。
    可是，促进全矿区的革命大联合，前面仍然摆着困难，需要说服教育，多做耐心细致的思想政治工作。
    有人说：有的问题没有澄清，不能联合！
    工人说：不联合，问题澄不清，越澄越不清。联合了，问题才能越澄越清。
    有人说：有些坏人还没有揪出来，不能联合！
    工人说：不联合，坏人有小山头保着。联合起来，坏人跑不了。
    有人说：有不同观点不能联合！
    工人说：我们工人阶级只有一个观点：毛泽东思想的观点！联合起来以后，也会有不同的意见，只要遵照毛主席教导，可以通过批评和自我批评来解决。
    榜样的力量是无穷的。淮南煤矿的工人阶级联合起来了，就有力地抵制了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的冲击，把一切革命力量团结在自己的周围，成为全市无产阶级革命派的骨干力量。他们的模范行动，终于促进了全市按系统、按行业、按班级的革命大联合。
      “斗私，批修”，克服派性，是巩固革命大联合的根本。谢家集矿、李一矿等煤矿实行革命大联合后，开初由于只是组织上铲除了小山头，思想上还是“私”字当头，派性当家，结果，仍然是貌合神离，联而不合。解放军同志针对这种情况，帮助革命职工，以“斗私，批修”为纲，结合学习“老三篇”和开展自我批评，在全矿展开了大立无产阶级党性，大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的大讨论。
    大讨论开拓了大家的胸襟，许多工人说：“派性派性，真理认不清”；“派性不除，内战不止”。大家在大学毛泽东思想的基础上，提出“头头闹派性，群众抵制；少数人闹派性，多数人抵制”的口号，掀起了群众性的抵制派性的活动，做到开会不带派性观点，生产不搞派性活动，表扬好人好事不从派性出发，使全矿充满团结向上的新景象。
    六四○八部队坚决按照毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的教导，紧紧依靠革命群众，紧紧依靠无产阶级革命派，遇事和群众商量，做群众的小学生。他们重视调查研究，用毛泽东思想分析一切，判断一切。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就拥护，就支持；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，就反对，就抵制。
    面对淮南两大派革命群众组织，六四○八部队的同志坚持支左不支派的原则，绝不在革命群众组织之间，片面地支持一方，打击一方。部队这样做，开始，有些人不理解，说他们是和稀泥，旗帜不鲜明。经过一段时间的实践，广大革命群众认识到：只有按照毛泽东思想的原则正确地对待革命群众组织，才能真正贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，有利于促进两派在革命的原则基础上联合起来。向阳区的许多工人说：部队这样做，正是坚持了无产阶级党性，避免了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，引导群众沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进。
    在淮南矿区，六四○八部队就是这样始终把宣传毛泽东思想当作支左工作的根本任务。他们把毛主席的各项最新指示，最迅速地传达到群众中去，直接同群众见面。他们协助群众在短时间内办起两千八百多个毛泽东思想学习班，引导群众严格按照毛泽东思想认识问题，解决问题。他们的实践证明：只要群众真正掌握了毛泽东思想，就能粉碎阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，就能排除派性的干扰，就能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
