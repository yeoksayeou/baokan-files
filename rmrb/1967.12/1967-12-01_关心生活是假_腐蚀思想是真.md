The arch-criminal of the Chinese revisionism, Khrushchev, vigorously promotes the revisionist line in the labor movement, always talking about "improving living conditions" and "providing welfare." He claims that the trade union is only for "solving workers' immediate living problems and fighting for workers' immediate living conditions." The master says so, and the servants do accordingly. The clique of capitalist roaders within the former Shanghai General Trade Union, in accordance with Khrushchev's instructions, held a "Factory-Level Trade Union Director Training Class" in 1963, inviting so-called "welfare experts" to peddle a set of revisionist black goods under the pretext of "caring for workers' lives," such as bonuses as the main incentive and extensive welfare provisions. They attempted to lead the workers' movement astray and turn the trade union into a tool for their capitalist restoration.

The clique of capitalist roaders within our company's party viewed Khrushchev's revisionist line in the labor movement as a treasure, claiming that "the trade union is all about taking care of workers' lives." They assigned tasks such as worker recuperation, public housing allocation, funeral arrangements, and condolences to the trade union. During festivals, they would organize "one-day tours" and "two-day tours" to Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi. Even worse, they followed Khrushchev's black directive of "not necessarily rewarding with products, money can also be used" and allocated 25% of the enterprise's reward fund to the trade union to establish various "competition awards," "safety awards," "quality awards," "economy awards," "plan completion awards," and "rationalization suggestion awards." What kind of trade union is this! It is simply a "feast union," a "play union," a "money union."

Just ask, if the trade union does not focus on ideological education and class struggle, but instead busies itself with eating, drinking, playing, and running around for economic welfare, where is the revolutionary workers' movement? This is clearly a betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause and a shameful act of selling out the fundamental interests of the working class!

We, the working class, bear the historical mission of "liberating all of humanity." We must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self" as the guideline, thoroughly smash Khrushchev's "welfare union." With the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, we will achieve new victories in "grasp revolution, promote production."

    关心生活是假　腐蚀思想是真
    上海工总司华电分部一公司“革联会”
    大工贼中国赫鲁晓夫，竭力推行修正主义的工运路线，开口“抓生活”，闭口“办福利”。他叫嚷工会只是“解决工人切身生活问题，为工人切身生活而斗争”。主子怎么说，奴才怎么做。前上海总工会党内一小撮走资派，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，于一九六三年，开办了一个什么“厂级工会主任学习班”，请来所谓“福利专家”，在“关心职工生活”的幌子下，拚命兜售奖金挂帅、大办福利等一套修正主义黑货，妄图把工人运动引入歧途，使工会成为他们复辟资本主义的工具。
    对中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的修正主义工运路线，我公司党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派视若珍宝，胡说什么：“工会嘛，就是抓职工生活”。他们把职工疗养、公房分配、死亡安葬、慰问抚恤等等统统划归工会负责。遇到节日，还要组织什么杭州、苏州、无锡“一日游”、“二日游”活动。更有甚者，他们按照中国赫鲁晓夫“不一定要奖产品，奖钱也可以”的黑指示，抽出百分之二十五的企业奖励基金，要工会建立什么“竞赛奖”、“安全奖”、“质量奖”、“节约奖”、“完成计划奖”、“合理化建议奖”等等。什么工会！简直是“吃会”，“玩会”，“钞票会”。
    试问，工会不抓思想教育，不搞阶级斗争，而终日为吃喝玩乐，经济福利奔走忙碌，哪里还有什么革命的工人运动！这明明是对无产阶级革命事业的背叛，是出卖工人阶级根本利益的无耻行径！
    我们工人阶级肩负“解放全人类”的历史使命。我们要高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，彻底砸烂中国赫鲁晓夫的“福利工会”。以最大的革命激情，夺取“抓革命，促生产”的新战果。
