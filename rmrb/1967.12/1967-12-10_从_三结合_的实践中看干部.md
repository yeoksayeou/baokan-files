Currently, more than 80% of the cadres in our bureau have come forward, and many cadres have participated in various levels of the "three-in-one" combination temporary power organs. Most comrades think this is very good; a few comrades think that liberation and combination have come too early, too many, and too fast; and a few comrades even doubt whether this is a disguised capitalist restoration.

Which view is correct? Chairman Mao teaches us: "The criterion of truth is only social practice." So let's see what role revolutionary leading cadres have played after participating in various levels of revolutionary committees.

For a period of time, some factories' revolutionary factions used coercive methods against groups and individuals who held different opinions. After discovering this problem, leading cadres participating in the bureau's revolutionary committee used their own mistakes to warn revolutionary faction members: "Suppressing the masses is an old method we used to follow the bourgeois reactionary line. After the revolutionary factions take power, we must not walk this old road again and do more political and ideological work." The revolutionary faction members accepted the advice of the revolutionary cadres. As a result, in eliminating antagonistic sentiments and promoting revolutionary great alliances at the grassroots level, achievements were quickly made. By the end of September, our entire bureau had basically achieved revolutionary great alliances by system, and the alliances in most units were quite solid.

Revolutionary cadres have relatively rich experience in political work and management capabilities, and they play an important role in seizing the revolution and promoting production. After many units' revolutionary cadres came forward, they emphasized politics and vigorously promoted the study of Chairman Mao's works, achieving immediate effects. Our bureau's production in the first three quarters increased by 10% compared to the same period last year, and advanced factories increased by more than 30% compared to the same period last year.

Revolutionary cadres, especially revolutionary leading cadres, are relatively familiar with the historical situation of their units. After more than a year of the Cultural Revolution and mass criticism, they have a deeper understanding of the revisionist line of managing enterprises promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev. Together with the broad masses of revolutionaries, they criticize revisionist goods, which can hit the target and expose deeply. This is very beneficial for thoroughly eliminating the remaining poison of revisionism and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units.

The practice of various factories in our bureau over the past few months has proven that where the party's cadre policy is correctly implemented, the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination power organs are more authoritative, the revolutionary great alliances are more solid and developed, the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the units are well done, and production is also well done.

    从“三结合”的实践中看干部
    上海市仪表电讯工业局革命委员会副主任　张富章
    目前，我们局已有百分之八十以上的干部站出来了，不少干部参加了各级三结合临时权力机构。对于这种情况，大多数同志认为好得很；少数同志认为，解放、结合得太早、太多、太快了；也有个别同志怀疑这是不是变相的资本主义复辟。
    哪一种看法正确呢？毛主席教导我们：“真理的标准只能是社会的实践。”那就看一看革命领导干部参加各级革命委员会以后，他们究竟发挥了哪些作用吧。
    有个时期，有些工厂的革命派对与自己持有不同意见的群众组织和群众，采取了压服的办法。参加局革命委员会的领导干部发现这个问题后，就用自己犯错误的教训，告诫革命派的同志说：压制群众，是我们过去执行资产阶级反动路线的老办法，革命派掌权以后，千万不要再走这条老路，要多做政治思想工作。革命派的同志接受了革命干部的劝告。结果，在消除对立情绪、促进基层单位革命大联合方面，就很快有了成绩。九月底，我们全局基本上实现了按系统的革命大联合，绝大部分单位的联合都比较巩固。
    革命干部有比较丰富的政治工作经验和管理业务的能力，在抓革命、促生产方面，发挥了重要的作用。不少单位的革命干部站出来以后，突出政治，狠抓毛主席著作的学习，收到了立竿见影的效果。我们局前三个季度的生产比去年同期增长百分之十，先进的工厂比去年同期增长百分之三十以上。
    革命干部，特别是革命领导干部，他们对本单位的历史情况比较熟悉。经过一年多文化大革命，经过群众性的批判，他们对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义办企业路线，有了比较深切的认识。他们和广大革命群众一起批判修正主义黑货，就更能击中要害，揭深批透。这对彻底清除修正主义余毒，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，是很有利的。
    我局各工厂几个月来的实践证明，凡是正确地贯彻执行了党的干部政策，革命三结合的权力机构就更有权威，革命的大联合就更加巩固和发展，本单位的斗批改就搞得好，生产也搞得好。
