Various revolutionary mass organizations in Xi'an are using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, taking "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as their guideline, breaking away from selfishness and establishing public spirit, overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit, enhancing unity, and jointly fighting against the enemy. The trend of achieving great unity in the revolution is becoming better and better.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions." Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly inspired the revolutionary masses in the Xi'an region. Many factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions' revolutionary mass organizations have followed Chairman Mao's teachings and achieved revolutionary great unity within their units. The revolution and production are presenting a prosperous new situation. The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations at the municipal level, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's leftist support troops, also sat together, bringing problems to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, discuss and consult on achieving revolutionary great unity, and have achieved good results.

The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations, in their study and discussions, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "conducting open, public, and mass self-criticism (each side only criticizes itself, not the other), and thoroughly correcting it." Through self-criticism, they summarized three lessons from not quickly achieving revolutionary great unity: First, weak class struggle awareness and pride in achievements. They said, Chairman Mao taught us: "Never forget class struggle. We must draw a clear line between two types of people. First, is it revolutionary or counter-revolutionary? Is it Yan'an or Xi'an?" In the previous period, we went against Chairman Mao's instructions, blurred the line between "Yan'an" and "Xi'an," weakened our awareness of the enemy, increased factionalism, fought "internal wars" with class brothers, and neglected the class enemy. A handful of capitalist roaders within the party took the opportunity to cause trouble. Second, in the good revolutionary situation, we did not seriously implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the revolutionary path of the proletariat," but instead, some people mistakenly regarded petty-bourgeois factionalism as proletarian "revolutionary spirit" and brought petty-bourgeois factionalism into the working class, affecting the unity within the working class ranks. Third, the most fundamental reason is that we did not always pay attention to using Mao Zedong Thought to transform our subjective world. We dare to reform others but are hesitant to reform ourselves. We only emphasize ourselves as a revolutionary force but neglect that we must continuously regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. Fear of reforming ourselves is actually fear of abandoning the "selfishness" in our minds. Carrying "selfishness" is not conducive to revolution.

Through study and discussion, everyone truly realized that to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, we must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the "selfishness" in our minds and fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionism of China's Khrushchev and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, everyone further opened their minds, exposed their selfish thoughts, and struggled against them. The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations all checked the "unique revolutionary" erroneous thoughts in their minds. They said, in the previous period, we saw less of the main trend of the other side and more of the minor issues; saw less of the big direction and more of the small faults; saw less of the advantages and more of the disadvantages. We always thought that everything about ourselves was good, and everything about the other side was bad. As a result, right and wrong were not distinguished, and enemies were not distinguished, affecting the unity. They said, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, let the masses educate themselves, and liberate themselves. But we once did not conduct class analysis and, without principles, were close to those who agreed with our views and opposed those who did not agree with our views. This is fundamentally against Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must wage a "people's war" of struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, reform the "selfishness," reform the "revisionism," and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations, who originally had strong opposing sentiments, through such open and sincere self-criticism in the study and discussion, strengthened their proletarian party spirit, reduced petty-bourgeois factionalism, eliminated opposing sentiments, and created a strong atmosphere of great unity. On this basis, everyone discussed together and decided that the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, who are responsible for leftist support tasks, should organize representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations to jointly discuss and consult on how to further carry out the struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, carry out the great criticism of the revolution, and how to further achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

The leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in the Xi'an region listened to Chairman Mao's words, actively, openly, and sincerely conducted self-criticism, took the lead in breaking away from selfish thoughts, eliminating factionalism, and received the welcome of the broad masses, which also played a promoting role in promoting revolutionary great unity. Some factories, enterprises, schools, and institutions that have not yet achieved revolutionary great unity immediately took action, held struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism meetings, opened Mao Zedong Thought study classes, held heart-to-heart talks, and held lectures on studying Chairman Mao's works. Leaders led the masses, and the masses urged the leaders. A mass struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, promoting revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, quickly emerged in the Xi'an region.

The revolutionary workers of Guiyang Cotton Mill firmly listened to Chairman Mao's words, took "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, and used Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely struggle against the "selfishness," consolidating the revolutionary great unity in thought. This is the workers studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together before class.

    多作自我批评狠斗私字  努力增强党性克服派性
    西安各革命群众组织斗私批修，加强团结，革命大联合的形势越来越好
    据新华社西安二日电　西安地区的各革命群众组织，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，破私立公，克服小资产阶级的派性，增强无产阶级的党性，增强团结，共同对敌，实现革命大联合的形势越来越好。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了西安地区的广大革命群众。许多工厂、企业、学校、机关的革命群众组织，遵循毛主席的教导，实现了本单位的革命大联合。革命和生产呈现出欣欣向荣的新局面。全市性的各革命群众组织负责人，在解放军支左部队的帮助下，也坐在一起，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，学习毛主席的最新指示，斗私批修，座谈和协商实现革命大联合的问题，并且收到了良好的效果。
    各革命群众组织的负责人在学习和座谈中，遵循毛主席的
  “实行公开的群众性的自我批评（各方面只批评自己，不批评对方），而彻底改正之”的教导，通过自我批评，总结了没有尽快实现革命大联合的三点经验教训：一、阶级斗争观念不强，居功骄傲。他们说，毛主席教导我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。要“划清两种界限。首先，是革命还是反革命？是延安还是西安？”我们前一段时期违背了毛主席的指示，模糊了“延安”和“西安”的界限，脑子里敌情淡薄了，派性上升了，同阶级兄弟打“内战”，却把阶级敌人丢在一边，党内一小撮走资派乘机捣乱。二、在革命的大好形势下，没有认真贯彻毛主席“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的指示，而是有的人却把小资产阶级的派性，错误地当作无产阶级的“革命性”，还把小资产阶级的派性带到工人阶级内部，影响了工人阶级队伍内部的团结。三、最根本的原因是，没有时刻注意用毛泽东思想来改造自己的主观世界。革别人的命，敢冲敢闯；革自己的命，畏首畏尾。只重视把自己当作革命的一份力量，忽视了还要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。怕革自己的命，实际上就是怕丢掉自己头脑里的“私”字，带着“私”字是干不好革命的。
    经过学习座谈，大家真正认识到，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就必须用战无不胜的毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，猛批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义和资产阶级反动路线。于是，大家又进一步敞开思想，亮私心，斗私心。各革命群众组织的负责人都检查了各自头脑里存在的“唯我独革”的错误思想。他们说，过去一个时期，我们对对方看主流少，看支流多；看大方向少，看小毛病多；看优点少，看缺点多。总认为自己的一切都好，对方的什么都不好。结果是是非不分，敌我不分，影响了联合。他们说，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是要我们相信群众，依靠群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。而我们曾一度不作阶级分析，无原则地对同意自己观点的就亲，对不同意自己观点的就反。这是根本违背毛泽东思想、违背毛主席革命路线的。我们一定要打一场斗私批修的“人民战争”，革“私”字的命，革“修”字的命，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    原来对立情绪很大的各革命群众组织的负责人，在学习座谈中经过这样开诚布公、推心置腹的自我批评，无产阶级党性增强了，小资产阶级派性减少了，对立情绪消除了，大联合的气氛浓厚了。在这个基础上，大家共同商量，决定由担任支左任务的解放军同志组织各革命群众组织的代表，一起协商讨论有关怎样进一步开展斗私批修，开展革命的大批判，以及怎样进一步实现革命大联合和革命三结合的问题。
    西安地区各革命群众组织的负责人，听毛主席的话，主动地、公开地、诚恳地作自我批评，带头破私心，除派性，受到了广大群众的欢迎，并且对促进革命的大联合起到了推动作用。一些还没有实现革命大联合的工厂、企业、学校、机关的革命群众，立即行动起来，纷纷召开斗私批修大会，开办毛泽东思想学习班，举行交心会和学习毛主席著作讲用会。头头带群众，群众促头头，一个群众性的斗私批修，促进革命大联合和革命三结合的高潮，迅速在西安地区出现了。（附图片）
    贵阳棉纺厂的革命职工，坚决听毛主席的话，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想狠斗“私”字，从思想上巩固革命的大联合。这是工人们在班前一起学习《毛主席语录》。
