Chen Diankui and the Red Guards, draped in golden dawn,
Walk on the road to Beijing.

Last October on a clear morning, Chen Diankui finished his night shift and returned from the construction site to his quarters. On the way, he saw a group of people wearing red armbands gathered under a red flag fluttering in the wind. Red Guards—the Red Guards supported by the great leader Chairman Mao! When Chen Diankui first saw a picture of Chairman Mao standing with them in the newspaper, he loved them from the bottom of his heart. Chen Diankui forgot the fatigue of working all night and rushed towards the Red Guards. "Comrades, where are you going?" he asked enthusiastically.

"We are responding to Chairman Mao's great call to 'march' and going to Beijing to see Chairman Mao!" the young guards replied loudly as they ate their dry rations.

Chen Diankui saw that they were only eating dry rations without any water to drink. He quickly ran back to the construction site, brought back a full basin of boiling water, and served it to the Red Guards bowl by bowl. The young guards gratefully said, "Thank you, soldier comrade." Chen Diankui said, "The soldiers and the Red Guards are heart to heart; we are all for the same revolutionary goal."

Chen Diankui and the young guards chatted happily, like brothers and sisters in a big family. During the conversation, Chen Diankui heard that a young comrade had walked hundreds of miles over mountains and rivers, and her feet were blistered. The little Red Guard said nonchalantly, "It's okay, it's good exercise." Chen Diankui, like an older brother, told her stories about long marches and carefully helped her treat her blisters.

After the Red Guards had eaten and drunk their fill, they set off again. Chen Diankui snatched the young comrade's backpack onto his shoulders and said, "Come on, I'll send you off for a while." The Red Guards tried to take back the backpack, but how could they take it from Chen Diankui, who was full of passion and strong?

A soldier and a group of Red Guards, draped in golden dawn, walked on the road to Beijing. Chen Diankui sometimes sang the "Chairman Mao's Quotations Song" with the young guards: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." Sometimes he told them the story of "The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of a long march." The resounding song echoed through the valleys, and the moving story stirred the hearts of the Red Guards.

Chen Diankui and the Red Guards together crossed the mountains and ridges of the Daqing Mountains, sending them off one step after another. The young guards took the backpack from Chen Diankui's shoulders and insisted that he not send them any further. With hearts full of passion, they said to Chen Diankui, "With Mao Zedong Thought as our driving force and the old Red Army as our example, we will definitely reach the place where all the people of the world yearn for—the source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing." At this moment, Chen Diankui waved goodbye to the Red Guards and reluctantly watched as the young guards gradually walked away. He shouted loudly, "Red Guards, when you see Chairman Mao in Beijing, please convey my respectful wishes for Chairman Mao's eternal life and shout a few times, 'Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand years!'"

The Red Guards were getting farther and farther away from Chen Diankui, but their hearts were growing closer and closer.

　　陈佃奎和红卫兵小将披着金色朝霞
　　走在通往北京的大路上
    去年十月的一个晴朗的早晨，陈佃奎下了夜班从工地回驻地。路上，他远远看到在一面迎风招展的红旗下，围坐着一群带着红袖章的红卫兵。红卫兵——伟大领袖毛主席支持的红卫兵！当陈佃奎第一次从报纸上看见毛主席同他们站在一起的照片，就从心眼里热爱他们了。陈佃奎忘记了施工一夜的劳累，大步向红卫兵跑去。“同学们，干什么去？”他热情地问道。“响应毛主席‘长征’的伟大号召，去北京见毛主席！”小将们一边吃着干粮，一边响亮地回答。
    陈佃奎见他们光吃干粮，没有水喝，忙转身跑回工地，打来满满一盆开水，一碗碗送到红卫兵手里。小将们感激地说：“谢谢解放军同志。”陈佃奎说：“解放军和红卫兵心连心，咱们都是为了一个共同的革命目标。”陈佃奎和小将们愉快地攀谈起来，象是一个大家庭里的亲兄妹。交谈中，陈佃奎听说有个小同学经过几百里的爬山涉水，脚上打了泡。那个小红卫兵却毫不在乎地说：“没有关系，锻炼锻炼就好了。”陈佃奎象个大哥哥，一边给她讲述长途行军的经验，一边细心帮她挑泡。
    红卫兵小将吃饱喝足，又踏上征途。陈佃奎把那个小同学的背包一下子抢到肩上，说：“走，我送你们一程。”红卫兵小将不让，往回夺背包，可又怎么能夺过满怀激情、身大体壮的陈佃奎呢！
    一个解放军战士和一队红卫兵小将，披着一身金色朝霞，走在通往北京的大路上。陈佃奎一会和小将们一遍又一遍地同声高唱毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，一会又给小将讲“红军不怕远征难”的故事。嘹亮的歌声震荡着山谷，动人的故事激动着红卫兵小将的心弦。……陈佃奎和红卫兵小将一起翻过了大青山的道道山梁，送了他们一程又一程。小将们从陈佃奎肩上夺下背包，无论如何不让他再送了，满怀激情地向陈佃奎说：有毛泽东思想作动力，有老红军作榜样，我们一定会走到全世界人民向往的地方，无产阶级文化大革命的策源地——北京。这时，陈佃奎便同红卫兵挥手告别，恋恋不舍地目送着小将们渐渐走远，他高声喊道：“红卫兵小将们，到北京见了毛主席，代我敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，高呼几声毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    红卫兵小将离陈佃奎越来越远了，他们的心贴得却越来越紧了。
