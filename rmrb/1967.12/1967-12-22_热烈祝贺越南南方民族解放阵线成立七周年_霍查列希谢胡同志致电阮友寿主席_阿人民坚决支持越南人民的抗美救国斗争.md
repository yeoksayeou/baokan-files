	Hearty Congratulations on the Seventh Anniversary of the Establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam

	Enver Hoxha, Haxhi Lleshi, and Mehmet Shehu Send a Telegram to Nguyen Huu Tho

	The Albanian People Resolutely Support the Vietnamese People's Anti-American, National Salvation Struggle

	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 20th — According to a report by the Albanian News Agency on the 19th, Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Haxhi Lleshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and Mehmet Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, sent a telegram to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, to express hearty congratulations on the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, we, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Presidium of the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Albania, and the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania, and in our personal capacity, extend our highest respects and most cordial, fraternal greetings to you and, through you, to the heroic people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	For the heroic people of South Vietnam, who are fighting under the leadership of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, the past seven years have been years of heroic struggle and glorious victories of historic significance against the aggressors, the American imperialists and their lackeys. The Vietnamese people, with their high patriotism and fearlessness of sacrifice, have thoroughly shattered the myth of the invincibility of American imperialism and modern weapons. Heroic Vietnam has become the graveyard of American aggressors.

	In the face of humiliating defeats in both North and South Vietnam, American imperialism, while escalating and intensifying the war, is desperately peddling and pushing its "peace talks" deception, attempting to bring the Vietnamese issue into the orbit of the United Nations, and through deceitful propaganda, to obtain what it has lost on the battlefield. However, the heroic Vietnamese people, undeterred by the deceitful "peace talks" clamor of the American imperialists and their modern revisionist accomplices, are united as one, determined to continue the just war, and will not be deceived by the plots of the enemies of freedom and independence of the peoples of the world. They will fight resolutely to the final victory. The only correct way to resolve the Vietnamese issue is to implement the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	The Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania regard the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism as their own struggle. They resolutely support this struggle and have stood, are standing, and will forever stand shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Vietnamese people. We are deeply convinced that final victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people, and we sincerely wish them new and greater victories in their just struggle.

	We wish the unbreakable friendship and combat unity between the Albanian people and the fraternal Vietnamese people to be further consolidated and developed.

    热烈祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年
    霍查列希谢胡同志致电阮友寿主席
    阿人民坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争
    新华社地拉那二十日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社十九日报道，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国人民议会主席团主席哈奇·列希和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡打电报给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿，热烈祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年。电报全文如下：
    在越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的时候，我们谨代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会、阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议，并以我们个人的名义，向你并通过你向英勇的越南南方人民和越南南方民族解放阵线致以最崇高的敬意和最亲切、兄弟般的祝贺。
    对于在民族解放阵线中央委员会领导下的英雄的越南南方人民说来，过去的七年是对美帝国主义侵略者及其仆从进行英勇斗争和取得具有重大历史意义的辉煌胜利的七年。越南人民有着高度的爱国主义和不怕牺牲的精神，他们彻底打破了美帝国主义和现代武器“不可战胜”的神话。英雄的越南今天已成为美国侵略者的葬身之地。
    美帝国主义在越南北方和南方面临可耻失败的情况下，在不断扩大和加强战争的同时，正在拚命鼓吹并推行其“和谈”骗局，企图把越南问题纳入联合国的轨道，通过蛊惑人心的宣传，得到在战场上失掉的东西。但是，英雄的越南人民不顾美帝国主义者及其帮凶现代修正主义者骗人的“和谈”叫嚣，他们团结如一人，决心继续进行正义战争，他们决不会被世界各国人民的自由和独立的敌人玩弄的阴谋所欺骗，他们将坚决战斗到最后胜利。解决越南问题的唯一正确的道路，是实行越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府把越南人民的抗美斗争看成是他们自己的斗争，他们坚决支持这场斗争，他们过去、现在和将来永远同兄弟的越南人民并肩站在一起。我们深信，最后胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民，我们衷心祝愿他们在自己的正义斗争中取得新的更大的胜利。
    祝阿尔巴尼亚人民和兄弟的越南人民之间的牢不可破的友谊和战斗团结更加巩固和发展。
