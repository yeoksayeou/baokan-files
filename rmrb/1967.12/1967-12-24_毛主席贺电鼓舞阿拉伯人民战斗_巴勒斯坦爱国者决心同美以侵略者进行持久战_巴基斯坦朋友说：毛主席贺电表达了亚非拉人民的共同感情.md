Palestinian patriots vow to wage a protracted war against U.S.-Israeli aggressors
Pakistani friends say: Chairman Mao's telegram expresses the common feelings of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America

BEIJING, Dec. 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian patriots and Iraqi friends have warmly hailed Chairman Mao's telegram to the president of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho. They said that Chairman Mao's telegram is a great encouragement and support for the Arab people who are fighting against U.S.-Israeli aggression.

A Palestinian patriot in Algiers told a Xinhua correspondent on Dec. 22: "Chairman Mao's telegram to Nguyen Huu Tho on the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is a great encouragement to the Palestinian people who are fighting for national liberation against U.S. imperialism and Zionism."

He said: "Chairman Mao pointed out in his telegram: 'No matter how big or small a country is, as long as it fully mobilizes its people, firmly relies on its people, and wages a people's war, any strong enemy can be defeated.' This is absolutely true. The Palestinian people are now fighting with confidence in the areas occupied by Israel. We are not only fighting against Zionism but mainly against the biggest imperialist power in the world, the United States. We are prepared to wage a people's war and a protracted war. We are full of confidence in victory."

The Palestinian patriot stressed that Chairman Mao is the banner of world revolution. He said about the struggle of the Vietnamese people: "The struggle of the Vietnamese people is our struggle, and our struggle is theirs, because we have a common enemy -- U.S. imperialism. Our Vietnamese brothers are fighting well. The Palestinian guerrillas have achieved initial brilliant victories. The final victory will be ours."

An Iraqi friend in Baghdad told a Xinhua correspondent on Dec. 21: "Chairman Mao's telegram is a strong support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people and a great encouragement for the Arab people's struggle against U.S.-Israeli aggression."

DHAKA, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- The people of Pakistan have warmly hailed the telegram sent by the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, to the president of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho.

The secretary-general of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association in East Pakistan, Ali, told a Xinhua correspondent: "Chairman Mao's telegram to the president of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho, is not only a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people who are now fighting against the U.S. aggressors but also expresses the common feelings of all the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He said, people's war is the only way for the oppressed people to fight against imperialist aggression. The victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have encouraged the struggles of other peoples. The Vietnamese people will surely win the final victory."

The chairman of the East Pakistan Students Union, Mustafa Jamal Haider, and the general secretary, Mabubulah, issued a joint statement on Dec. 22 saying: "As Chairman Mao pointed out in this telegram, no matter how big or small a country is, as long as it persists in people's war, it will surely be able to defeat the most powerful imperialist country. In the past seven years, the people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have achieved brilliant victories, dealt a fatal blow to U.S. imperialism, and set a brilliant example for all the oppressed and freedom-loving people in the world."

The statement condemned the treacherous support and betrayal of the Soviet revisionists to the struggle of the Vietnamese people and condemned the pressure exerted by the Soviet revisionists on the Vietnamese people on the issue of "peace talks."

The statement expressed solidarity with the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and warned U.S. imperialism not to expand the war to Cambodia and Laos.

The secretary-general of the Pakistan Journalists Association, Minhaj Barna, issued a statement to the press on Dec. 22 saying: "The victory of the South Vietnamese people's struggle proves the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought: the people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, can only achieve true national independence, democracy, and peace through people's war and long-term armed struggle."

The statement expressed full support for the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people for freedom. The statement said: "The U.S. aggressors must withdraw from Vietnamese territory and let the Vietnamese people decide their own fate."

The statement stressed that neither the U.S. imperialist "escalation" of the war nor the Soviet revisionist deception can stop the heroic Vietnamese people from marching towards complete victory.
