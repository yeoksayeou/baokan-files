The brave people of South Yemen, after a long period of armed struggle against British imperialism, finally achieved independence on November 30 and established the People's Republic of South Yemen. This is a great victory for the South Yemen national liberation movement, especially the armed struggle over the past four years, and the result of the South Yemen people's long-term anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle.

Under the inspiration of the flourishing national liberation movement in Asia and Africa, the South Yemen people, through more than a century of their own struggles, gradually came to understand the profound truth of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." They fearlessly confronted British imperialism's military suppression and were not deceived by its political tricks. They firmly believed that only through armed struggle could they achieve true independence and complete national liberation.

In October 1963, the people of South Yemen reignited the flames of armed struggle in the western Radfan mountain area. After more than four years of armed struggle, the people's armed forces grew from small to large and from weak to strong, achieving significant development. In the battles, the South Yemen nationalist warriors studied Chairman Mao's great military thoughts on guerrilla warfare, breaking through the British colonial army's tight blockade and fierce sweeps, and flexibly annihilating the enemy. Especially in the past year and this year, the armed struggle has made significant progress, expanding from the initial Radfan mountain area to the entire South Yemen. In August and September of this year, the National Liberation Front announced control over most of the areas of the "Federation of South Arabia," a puppet state backed by Britain in South Yemen, causing the puppet "federation" to collapse; subsequently, they also controlled the entire "East Aden Protectorate" (Sudan). In the Aden area, nationalists also bravely struck the British colonial army, making the enemy tremble with fear.

The independence of South Yemen is the result of the South Yemen people's unyielding, long-term struggle. From the day British imperialism occupied their land, they began fighting for their independence and freedom. Despite the brutal suppression by the British colonial army, the South Yemen people launched numerous large-scale anti-British uprisings, the most famous of which was the 1951 uprising in Upper Awlaqi, which lasted until 1954. In May 1959, in Upper Awlaqi and the entire South Arabian highlands, tens of thousands of tribal people entered the mountains to wage fierce armed struggles against the British colonial authorities.

While engaging in armed struggle, the South Yemen people also launched a massive movement in the cities against British colonial rule. Strikes and protests surged. In 1961 and 1962 alone, Aden witnessed dozens of large-scale strikes and numerous massive protests. In late November 1963, over 6,000 workers and employees at the Aden military base went on strike, paralyzing the entire base. Since this year, Aden has seen relatively large-scale anti-imperialist strikes and demonstrations almost every month, demanding an end to British colonial rule, opposing the interference of the "United Nations delegation" in South Yemen, and protesting against the new aggression by the US and Britain against Arab countries. The South Yemen people shouted slogans such as "British imperialism out of Aden!" "No military bases!" "Armed struggle is the only path to our freedom!"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All the people of the world, unite! The imperialists and all reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful. The people have a powerful revolutionary spirit. The people are the real heroes. The people are the decisive factor in the struggle against imperialism and for national liberation. The people are the creators of world history. The people are the makers of the world's future." The victory of the South Yemen people shows that the national liberation struggle of the Arab people is unstoppable. Imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger. As long as the oppressed nations and peoples unite and dare to fight resolutely against imperialism, they will win.

In the early stages of the armed struggle in South Yemen in October 1963, there were only seventy nationalist warriors equipped with ordinary weapons like rifles, while they faced a British colonial army of 20,000, fully armed to the teeth, and behind British imperialism stood the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led by American imperialism. However, the South Yemen people, with an unshakable belief in victory, raised the banner of national independence, persisted in armed struggle, and gradually developed their strength in the struggle, finally forcing British imperialism to withdraw its occupying army.

The South Yemen people have won independence, but this is not the end of the struggle; it is the beginning of a new struggle under new conditions. The cunning British imperialists will not easily give up their colonial interests. They are trying to sabotage South Yemen's independence through various plots and are sparing no effort to divide and disintegrate the unity of the South Yemen people. British imperialism will also collude with various reactionary forces to implement various evil plans against the People's Republic of South Yemen. The US and the Soviet revisionists also seek to intervene. After declaring independence, the South Yemen people still face the arduous and complex tasks of eliminating imperialism and feudal forces and maintaining and consolidating national independence. In the future struggle, the South Yemen people will surely achieve new victories.

    枪杆子里面出政权
    南也门人民坚持武装斗争赢得独立
    新华社三十日讯　本社记者报道：英勇的南也门人民经过长期的反对英帝国主义的武装斗争之后，终于在十一月三十日取得独立，成立了南也门人民共和国。这是南也门民族解放运动，特别是四年来武装斗争的伟大胜利，是南也门人民长期反帝反殖斗争的结果。
    南也门人民在蓬勃发展的亚非民族解放运动的鼓舞下，从他们一个多世纪的切身斗争实践中，逐渐懂得了世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断。他们对英帝国主义的军事镇压毫无畏惧，对英帝国主义的政治欺骗也不上当。他们坚信，只有坚持武装斗争才能获得真正的独立和彻底的民族解放。
    一九六三年十月，南也门人民在西部拉德凡山区重新点燃了武装斗争的革命烈火。经过四年多的武装斗争，人民武装力量由小到大，由弱变强，有了很大的发展。在战斗中，南也门民族主义战士注意学习毛主席关于游击战争的伟大军事思想，粉碎了英国殖民军的严密封锁和疯狂扫荡，机动灵活地消灭敌人。特别是去年和今年，武装斗争取得了重大发展，武装斗争地区，由最初的拉德凡山区扩展到南也门全境。今年八、九月间，民族解放阵线宣布控制了英国在南也门扶植的“南阿拉伯联邦”的大部分地区，使这个傀儡“联邦”土崩瓦解；随后又控制了南也门的“东亚丁保护地”的全部（苏丹国）。在亚丁地区，民族主义者也英勇地打击英国殖民军，使敌人胆颤心惊。
    南也门的独立是南也门人民前赴后继、长期坚持斗争的结果。他们从英帝国主义侵占的第一天起，为了争取自己的独立和自由，就开始了斗争。南也门人民不顾英国殖民军的残暴镇压，曾举行了多次大规模的反英起义，其中最有名的一次是一九五一年爆发的上奥拉基的拉比齐起义，这次起义持续到一九五四年。一九五九年五月在上奥拉基以及整个南阿拉伯山区，又有成万的部落人民进入山区，对英国殖民当局展开激烈的武装斗争。
    在进行武装斗争的同时，南也门人民还在城市开展了波澜壮阔的反对英国殖民统治的群众运动。罢工斗争，抗议示威此伏彼起。仅在一九六一年和一九六二年，亚丁就爆发了几十次大规模的罢工运动和许多次声势浩大的群众游行示威。一九六三年十一月底，亚丁军事基地上的六千多名工人和职员宣布罢工，使整个基地陷于瘫痪。今年以来，亚丁几乎每个月都爆发较大规模的群众性反帝大罢工和示威，要求结束英国殖民统治，反对“联合国代表团”干涉南也门局势，抗议美英以对阿拉伯国家发动新的侵略。南也门人民群众喊出了“英帝国主义从亚丁滚出去！”“不要军事基地！”“武装斗争是我们取得自由的唯一道路！”等口号。
    毛主席教导我们：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”南也门人民的胜利说明，阿拉伯人民的民族解放斗争是不可阻挡的。帝国主义只不过是纸老虎。只要被压迫民族和人民团结起来，敢于同帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，他们就能赢得胜利。南也门在一九六三年十月发动武装斗争初期，只有由步枪等普通武器装备起来的七十名民族主义战士，而他们面临的是一支武装到牙齿的人数达两万的英国殖民军，而且，在英帝国主义背后还有以美帝国主义为首的北大西洋集团的支持。但是，南也门人民抱着必胜的信念，高举民族独立的旗帜，坚持武装斗争，在斗争中逐步发展了力量，终于迫使英帝国主义撤退占领军。
    南也门人民赢得了独立，并不是斗争的结束，而是在新的条件下斗争的开始。老奸巨猾的英帝国主义是不会轻易放弃殖民利益的。它正力图通过种种阴谋，破坏南也门独立，千方百计分裂瓦解南也门人民的团结。英帝国主义还将勾结各种反动势力对南也门人民共和国推行各种罪恶计划，美帝和苏修也企图趁机插手。在宣布独立之后，南也门人民还面临着肃清帝国主义、封建势力、维护和巩固民族独立的各项艰巨复杂的任务。南也门人民在今后的斗争中必将不断取得新的胜利。
