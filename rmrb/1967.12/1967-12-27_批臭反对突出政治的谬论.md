    Refute the Fallacies Against Emphasizing Politics
    Political Instructor, Fourth Platoon, Militia Camp, Dunli Production Brigade

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental changes in the socio-economic system." However, another major capitalist-roader within the Party openly defies Chairman Mao by advocating, "It doesn't matter if the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat." This is a call to prioritize production above all else, claiming that good production is good politics and that production is everything. Ultimately, this is a public opposition to emphasizing proletarian politics and the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, allowing bourgeois ideology to occupy all positions and paving the way for capitalist restoration. This is a heinous crime!

    Whether or not to emphasize proletarian politics is a fundamental issue of revolution, a major issue of whether to adhere to the socialist path, and a crucial issue of whether we advance towards communism or regress towards capitalism. In 1962, another major capitalist-roader within the Party released the poisonous "black cat, white cat" theory, causing some people to be poisoned. Some said: "Production tasks are rigid, political tasks are like rubber bands." Others said: "It's okay if politics is a bit weak, but production must not lag behind, otherwise, we won't get the red flag or make the red list." Some well-off middle peasants said: "We farm to have a good life." Now, every household has grain, pigs in the pen, and no worries about food or clothing. If there's anything lacking, it's just a few more brick houses. They don't put much effort into production. Some landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements boasted: "If you want us to produce, you must prioritize the economy, ensure grain supply, lead in materials, and don't cut our work points." A historical counter-revolutionary not only engaged in speculation and market disruption but also spread poison, saying: "Being an official is not as good as selling water pipes, farming is not as good as growing on the edges." They used every means to sabotage our socialism. At that time, capitalism was on the rise, and evil winds blew, creating a chaotic atmosphere. I was also poisoned by this "black cat, white cat" theory, focusing only on grain, cotton, and oil, thinking about water, fertilizer, and seeds, neglecting class struggle, and not emphasizing proletarian politics. I did not criticize these fallacies and did not timely suppress the evil winds stirred up by the ghosts and snakes.

    At that time, the militia and poor and lower-middle peasants saw these problems and posted a big-character poster criticizing me, pointing out: "Our brigade's cadres only think about grain, cotton, and oil, not distinguishing between enemies and friends. Community members go to work only for work points, not caring about the direction. Class brothers have the clearest minds and sharpest eyes, best at distinguishing right from wrong and identifying enemies and friends." This big-character poster struck me hard. Together with the militia and poor and lower-middle peasants, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on emphasizing politics and realized that I had drunk the "hallucinogenic potion" of China's Khrushchev and another major capitalist-roader within the Party, falling for their tricks. The mistake lies in having too little Mao Zedong Thought in my mind. If I continued like this, busy every day, confused, I wouldn't know if the flag had changed or if my head had been cut off!

    Since then, I have paid attention to emphasizing proletarian politics. The broad masses of militia and poor and lower-middle peasants have trusted me even more. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our brigade quickly reached a new high. The class standpoint of cadres and the masses has been strengthened, ideological awareness has been raised, the relationship between public and private interests has changed, and the production situation has improved.

    批臭反对突出政治的谬论
    墩里大队民兵营第四排政治干事  缪启贵
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”但是，党内另一个最大的走资派却明目张胆地同毛主席唱对台戏，叫嚷什么：“不管白猫黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫。”这是鼓吹生产第一，生产好就是政治好，生产就是一切。这归根到底就是公开反对突出无产阶级政治，反对突出伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，让资产阶级思想去占领一切阵地，让资本主义复辟。真是罪恶滔天！
    突出不突出无产阶级政治是革命不革命的根本问题，是坚持社会主义道路还是不坚持社会主义道路的大问题，是关系到我们向共产主义前进还是向资本主义倒退的大问题。一九六二年，党内另一个最大的走资派放出了“只要捉住老鼠就是好猫”的毒气，使一些人中毒。有人说：生产任务硬碰硬，政治任务是橡皮筋。有人说：政治差点不要紧，生产差一两，插不到红旗，上不了红榜。有些富裕中农说什么：我们种田就是为了过好日子。如今户户囤里有粮，圈里有猪，吃用不愁，要说欠缺，就是少几间小瓦房子。他们生产也不来劲。一些地、富、反、坏分子扬言道：要我们生产，就要经济挂帅，粮食跟上，物资带头，工分不让。有个历史反革命分子，一方面大搞投机倒把，扰乱市场，一方面又放毒说：“当干部不如贩水烟，上大田不如种十边。”他们千方百计想搞垮我们的社会主义。那时候，资本主义抬头，歪风邪气上升，真是乌烟瘴气一时。我也中了这个坏家伙“白猫”、“黑猫”论的毒，想问题就是粮棉油，打主意就是水肥种，不注意阶级斗争，不注意突出无产阶级政治，没有对这些谬论进行批判，没有及时把牛鬼蛇神刮的这股歪风打下去。
    当时，民兵和贫下中农看到这些问题，联名给我贴了大字报，一针见血地批评道：我们队里干部脑子里只有粮棉油，不分敌我友，社员出工只讲进账（争工分），行动不问方向。阶级兄弟的心最明，眼最亮，最能辨是非，分敌我。这张大字报给我背后猛击一掌。我和民兵、贫下中农一起学习毛主席关于突出政治的一系列教导，才知道我是喝了中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派的“迷魂汤”，上了他们的当。千错万错，错在脑子里毛泽东思想太少。如果这样下去，整天忙的昏头转向，旗子换了还不知道，脑袋丢了还不晓得哩！
    从那以后，我就重视突出无产阶级政治了，广大民兵和贫下中农就更加信任我了，队里活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动很快掀起了高潮。干部和群众的阶级观点加强了，思想觉悟提高了，公私关系变化了，生产面貌改观了。
