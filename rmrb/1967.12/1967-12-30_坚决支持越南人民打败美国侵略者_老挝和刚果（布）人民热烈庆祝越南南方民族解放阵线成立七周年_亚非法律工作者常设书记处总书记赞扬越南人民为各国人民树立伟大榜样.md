	KANPAI, Laos (Xinhua) — More than 5,000 people from various sectors in Khammouane Province of Laos gathered on December 22 in Kanpai to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	Rich representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee, including Minister of Information, Propaganda, and Tourism, and General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, Fumi Fonvix, and the head of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces Management Committee, Vunle, attended the meeting and delivered speeches.

	The Chinese and Vietnamese economic and cultural delegations in Laos were also invited to attend the meeting.

	The meeting unanimously passed a resolution strongly condemning the U.S. imperialist aggression against South Vietnam and highly praising the heroic fighting spirit of the South Vietnamese people. The resolution emphasized that the Vietnamese issue can only be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves. The five-point statement of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are the only ways to resolve the Vietnamese issue. The resolution expressed the determination of the Lao people to stand together with their Vietnamese brothers to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

	According to Xinhua, on the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, thousands of young pioneers and students in the capital of Congo (Brazzaville) held grand rallies on December 20 and 21 to express their full support and active solidarity with the Vietnamese people and Vietnamese children until their anti-American national salvation struggle achieves final victory.

	The meeting passed a protest letter from the Congolese (Brazzaville) children against the crimes of the murderer Johnson. The letter strongly protested the dirty and barbaric aggression war that the Americans are waging in Vietnam.

	The protest letter said, "If Johnson insists on continuing his aggression, he will soon meet the same fate as Hitler."

	The protest letter quoted the words of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao: "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." Then, the young pioneers held up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read in unison: "Resolutely fight, be prepared to sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The audience applauded and cheered enthusiastically.

	According to Xinhua, Ibrahim Fofana, Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Legal Workers, recently sent a telegram from Conakry, Guinea, to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, expressing the warmest congratulations on the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

	The telegram said that under the correct leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the heroic people of South Vietnam have set a great example of revolutionary armed struggle against U.S. aggression for the people of all countries in the world, greatly inspiring the struggle of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world.

	The telegram pointed out that the military and civilians of South Vietnam have fully demonstrated the unlimited power of people's war. Millions of people are united as one, forming an indestructible Great Wall. The U.S. aggressors, whether in the aggression war in the South or in the indiscriminate bombing of the North, have suffered huge defeats and fallen into unprecedented difficulties. This once again shows that the armed-to-the-teeth U.S. bandits can be defeated, and the truly powerful are the awakened, united, and fearless people of all countries.

	The telegram expressed that the Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Legal Workers, as always, firmly supports the just struggle of the South Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression for national salvation and will always stand side by side with the Vietnamese brothers in the South to fight to the end and defeat U.S. imperialism.

    新华社康开电　老挝川圹省各界人民五千多人二十二日在康开举行集会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年。
    老挝民族团结政府新闻、宣传和游览大臣、老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记富米·冯维希和老挝爱国中立力量管理委员会负责人汶勒出席了大会，并讲了话。
    中国和越南驻老挝经济文化代表团分别应邀出席了大会。
    大会一致通过决议，强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南南方的侵略，热烈赞扬越南南方人民的英勇斗争精神。决议强调指出，越南问题只能由越南人民自己来解决，越南南方民族解放阵线提出的五点声明和越南民主共和国提出的四项主张，是解决越南问题的唯一办法。决议表示老挝人民决心同兄弟的越南人民一起，战胜美帝国主义及其走狗。
    据新华社布拉柴维尔电　在越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的时候，成千上万的刚果（布）少年先锋队员和学生，分别在十二月二十日和二十一日在刚果（布）首都布拉柴维尔举行盛大集会，表示全力支持和积极声援越南人民和越南儿童，直到他们的抗美救国正义斗争取得最后胜利。
    大会通过了刚果（布）儿童对杀人犯约翰逊罪行的抗议书。强烈抗议美国佬在越南进行的肮脏和野蛮的侵略战争。
    抗议书说，“如果约翰逊在侵略战争中仍然执意蛮干下去，那么在不久的将来，他就要落到同希特勒一样的下场”。
    抗议书中引用了世界人民伟大的领袖毛主席的语录：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”接着，少年先锋队员们高举《毛主席语录》有节奏地齐声朗读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”到会群众热烈鼓掌、欢呼。
    据新华社科纳克里电亚非法律工作者常设书记处总书记易卜拉希马·福法纳最近从几内亚科纳克里打电报给越南南方民族解放阵线，对越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年表示最热烈的祝贺。
    电报说，在越南南方民族解放阵线的正确领导下，英雄的越南南方人民为世界各国人民树立了抗击美国侵略的革命武装斗争的伟大榜样，大大鼓舞了全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的斗争。
    电报指出，越南南方军民充分发挥了人民战争的无限威力。千百万人团结得象一个人一样，形成一条不可摧毁的长城。美国侵略者无论是在南方进行的侵略战争中，还是在对北方进行的狂轰滥炸中，都遭到了巨大的失败，陷入了前所未有的困境。这就再一次表明，武装到牙齿的美国强盗是可以打败的，真正有力量的是觉悟的、团结一致和在斗争中无所畏惧的各国人民。
    电报表示，亚非法律工作者常设书记处一如既往坚决支持越南南方人民的抗美救国正义斗争，并将始终同兄弟的越南南方人民并肩战斗到底，打败美帝国主义。
