Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples and parties of China and Thailand! Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China warmly congratulates the 25th anniversary of the Communist Party of Thailand and resolutely supports the armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people sincerely thank the Communist Party of Thailand and the Thai people for their boundless admiration for the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and their high evaluation of Mao Zedong Thought. We sincerely thank you for your enthusiastic praise and active support for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are deeply convinced that the Communist Party of Thailand, which insists on waging people's war, will certainly grow stronger in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and the overthrow of the reactionary rule of the Thanom government, unite the entire party and people of all nationalities, and achieve the final victory of the people's war.

	New China News Agency, November 30th — The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a telegram on the 30th to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand, warmly congratulating the 25th anniversary of the Communist Party of Thailand. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Thailand,

	Dear Comrades,

	The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people warmly congratulate the Communist Party of Thailand on its 25th anniversary.

	The Communist Party of Thailand, holding high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, persists in the revolutionary road of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power through armed struggle. Currently, it is leading the Thai people in a heroic struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Thanom government.

	The Communist Party of Thailand, for the sake of safeguarding the purity of Marxism-Leninism, firmly stands on the position of proletarian internationalism, and together with other Marxist-Leninist brother parties, resolutely fights against modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU. It has made significant contributions to the cause of the international communist movement.

	The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people resolutely support the armed struggle led by the Communist Party of Thailand.

	We are deeply convinced that the Communist Party of Thailand, which insists on waging people's war, will certainly grow stronger in the struggle, unite the entire party and people of all nationalities, and achieve the final victory of the people's war.

	The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people sincerely thank the Communist Party of Thailand and the Thai people for their boundless admiration for the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and their high evaluation of Mao Zedong Thought. We sincerely thank you for your enthusiastic praise and active support for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The fighting friendship between the parties and peoples of China and Thailand, forged in the long-term revolutionary struggle, will certainly be further consolidated and developed in the common struggle ahead.

	Long live the fighting friendship between the parties and peoples of China and Thailand!

	Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

	Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
	November 30, 1967
