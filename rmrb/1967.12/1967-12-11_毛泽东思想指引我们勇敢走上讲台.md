In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "cadres teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching cadres, and soldiers teaching soldiers," with the help of the PLA comrades and teachers, have boldly taken to the stage to teach! This is a bold exploration in our educational revolution.

Over the past few months, I have several times, along with my classmates, taught political and language classes. From practice, I have felt that this method has at least three advantages: first, it promotes the ideological revolutionization of both myself and my classmates; second, it cultivates our ability to think independently; third, it helps to eliminate the poisonous influence of revisionist educational thought.

The first advantage, I feel the most deeply. At the beginning, when I started teaching, my mind was in chaos. Not teaching would go against the great call of the highest commander, Chairman Mao, for an educational revolution. How could Mao's Little Red Guards not respond? Teaching, however, my level was not high, and I couldn't just go up there and talk nonsense. Especially since I was teaching political and language classes, if I made a mistake, my classmates would surely criticize me; even if I got it right, if I made a slip after class and did something different from what I said on stage, my classmates would still say I was a revolutionary in words only. Thinking it over, there was no way out. I went to Chairman Mao's works to find the answer. I focused on studying a passage in his "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperative Transformation": "We must dare to lead the movement, and not be afraid of dragons in front or tigers behind." Chairman Mao here advocates "daring" and criticizes "fear." I thought, as a Little Red Guard of Chairman Mao and a class cadre, I should resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words. Although I can't talk about "leading the movement," I should get rid of "fear," dare to fight dragons, and dare to fight tigers, and boldly go up on stage to teach. After thinking this way, my courage came, and my view of the problem became more comprehensive: if I made a mistake, my classmates should criticize me. Only through criticism can we all improve together. As for being afraid of classmates saying I am a revolutionary in words only, it would only make me more strict with myself, always acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, and doing what I say in the classroom and outside the classroom. For this, I often pay attention to sweeping away the political dust in my mind, fighting selfishness in my preparations, and exposing my selfishness in my teaching. Once, I and my classmates together taught a criticism class, criticizing China's Khrushchev's reactionary views of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," etc. In my preparations and teaching, I exposed my selfish thoughts, and in the process, criticized my wrong thoughts. Other classmates who participated in the teaching also did the same. We felt that the process of going up on stage to teach is also the process of fighting selfishness, which is beneficial to promoting the ideological revolutionization of classmates.

The second advantage is cultivating the independent thinking ability of classmates. Students participating in lesson preparation and going up on stage to teach must think more and research more. Some political and language classes were almost entirely prepared by the whole class, and the benefits were even greater. On November 30th, Teacher Jia and my classmates together taught Chairman Mao's poem "West Lake Moonlight · Jinggangshan." This is a good example in this regard. A week before the class, the teacher explained the difficult characters in the poem to everyone and talked a bit about the historical background when Chairman Mao wrote this poem, and the rest was all left to the students to think about during the preparation. During the preparation, classmates automatically formed small groups, each contributing a sentence, inspiring each other, and improving together. Our group had six people. Through discussion, after understanding the meaning of the poem, we divided up to find Chairman Mao's quotations for summary. One classmate found a quotation: "In order to fight against the enemy, we have formed a concept over a long period of time, that is, in strategy we must despise all enemies, and in tactics we must take all enemies seriously." Everyone compared the poem and studied it, feeling that the first stanza exactly embodied Chairman Mao's great thought of "in strategy we must despise all enemies," and the second stanza exactly embodied Chairman Mao's great thought of "in tactics we must take all enemies seriously." Therefore, all the members of the group agreed to use Chairman Mao's quotation to summarize "West Lake Moonlight · Jinggangshan." In class, I represented our group and went up on stage to talk a bit, and other groups also had representatives to teach. Finally, the teacher pointed out to everyone where it was good and where it was not good, and absorbed the strengths of the students' teaching, and taught the whole text again. Because we had all thought about it beforehand, the impression in class was especially deep. Everyone said: Teachers teach, students also teach, teachers and students learn from each other, this is a revolutionary method!

There is another advantage, which is to help eliminate the poisonous influence of revisionist educational thought. In the past, whether it was teachers or students, everyone was focused on grades. If you got a lot of grades, teachers liked you, and classmates admired you; if you got few grades, everyone looked down on you, and even joining the Youth League was difficult. For grades, teachers and students, classmates often had disagreements. Now, teachers and students prepare lessons together, teach together, everyone is both a teacher and a student, considering how to highlight Mao Zedong Thought, how to carry out the educational revolution, and eliminate the poisonous influence of revisionist educational thought, and no longer hear arguments about grades.

Ten thousand good things, only Mao Zedong Thought is the best. Recently, Vice Chairman Lin's inscription "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" exactly expresses our feelings. We are doing the proletarian educational revolution, just like navigating the vast ocean, not for a moment can we be separated from the great helmsman Chairman Mao, relying entirely on Mao Zedong Thought! We will definitely follow Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, and make the educational revolution better and better!

### 毛泽东思想指引我们勇敢走上讲台

　　毛泽东思想指引我们勇敢走上讲台
　　北京草场地中学学生　艾春莲
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们，毛主席的红小兵，遵照毛主席关于官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵的教导，在解放军同志和老师的帮助下，大胆走上讲台讲课了！这是我们在教育革命中的一个大胆的探索。
    几个月来，我几次同大伙一起讲政治课和语文课。从实践中，我体会到，这种作法至少有三好：一是促进了自己和同学们的思想革命化；二是培养了我们的独立思考能力；三是有助于肃清修正主义教育思想的流毒。
    第一好，我体会得最深。开始讲课那一阵子，我心里很乱。不讲吧，教育革命是最高统帅毛主席发出的伟大号召，毛主席的红小兵怎能不响应呢？讲吧，自己的水平不高，总不能上台瞎说一通呀。特别是自己讲的是政治课和语文课，万一说错了，同学们准要批判；即使讲对了，下课后一不小心，做的和在讲台上说的不一样，同学还能不说自己是口头革命派？思前想后，没有办法，我就到毛主席著作里找答案。我着重学习了他老人家在《关于农业合作化问题》中的一段教导：“要大胆指导运动，不要前怕龙，后怕虎。”毛主席在这里提倡的是“大胆”二字，批评的是“怕”字。我想，自己是毛主席的红小兵，又是班干部，应该坚决听毛主席的话，虽说谈不上“指导运动”，但应该丢掉“怕”字，敢同龙斗，敢与虎战，大胆地上台讲课。经过这么一想，勇气就来了，对问题的看法就全面了：自己讲错了，同学们应该批判。只有经过批判，大伙才能共同提高。至于怕同学说自己是口头革命派，那正好促使我更加严格地要求自己，时时处处按照毛泽东思想办事，做到课堂上下言行一致。为此，我经常注意打扫侵入自己头脑里的政治灰尘，在备课时斗私，在讲课时亮私。有一次，我和同学们一起讲批判课，批判中国赫鲁晓夫“吃小亏，占大便宜”等反动观点。在备课和讲课时，我把自己的私心摆了出来，结合着批判了自己的错误思想。其他参加讲课的同学，也都是这样做的。我们体会到，上台讲课的过程，也就是斗私的过程，有利于促进同学们的思想革命化。
    第二好，培养了同学的独立思考能力。学生参加备课，上台讲课，就得多思考，多研究。有些政治课和语文课，几乎全班同学都参加备课，好处就更多。十一月三十日，贾老师和我班同学一起讲的毛主席诗词《西江月·井冈山》，就是这方面的好例子。讲课前一个星期，老师把诗词中的生字向大家解释了一下，并讲了讲毛主席写这一首词的时代背景，其余全由学生在备课中思考。备课时，同学们自动结合成小组，你一句，我一句，相互启发，共同提高。我们小组有六个人，通过讨论，把诗词的意义弄懂后，就分头找毛主席语录进行总结。有一个同学找的语录是：“为了同敌人作斗争，我们在一个长时间内形成了一个概念，就是说，在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。”大家对照诗词研究了一下，觉得前一节正好体现了毛主席“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人”的伟大思想，后一节正好体现了毛主席“在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的伟大思想。因此，全组同学都同意用毛主席这段语录给《西江月·井冈山》作总结。在课堂上，我代表我们小组上台讲了一下，其他小组也都有代表讲课。最后，老师向大家指出那里讲得好，那里讲得不对，并吸取同学们讲课的优点，把全文讲了一遍。因为事先我们都经过思考，课堂印象就特别深。大伙都说：老师教课，学生也教课，师生互教互学，这是一个革命的办法！
    还有一个好处，就是有助于肃清修正主义教育思想的流毒。过去，不管是老师或学生，都是围着分数转。分数得的多，老师喜欢，同学佩服；分数得的少，人家都看不起，甚至入团也困难。为了分数，师生、同学之间常闹不团结。现在，师生在一起备课，一起讲课，大家既是先生，也是学生，考虑的是如何突出毛泽东思想，如何进行教育革命，肃清修正主义教育思想的流毒，再听不到争分数的事了。
    千好万好，只有毛泽东思想最最好。最近，林副统帅的题词“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，全说到我们心上了。我们干无产阶级教育革命，就好象在大海航行一样，一刻也离不开伟大舵手毛主席，全靠的是毛泽东思想！我们一定遵照林副统帅的指示，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，把教育革命搞得好上加好！
