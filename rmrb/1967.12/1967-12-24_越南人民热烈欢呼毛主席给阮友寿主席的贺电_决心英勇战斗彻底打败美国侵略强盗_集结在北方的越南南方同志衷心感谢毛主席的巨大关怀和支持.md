The heroic Vietnamese people, who are bravely fighting and achieving brilliant victories against U.S. imperialism, warmly welcome the telegram from the great leader Chairman Mao to the Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho. This telegram greatly encourages the Vietnamese military and people to advance and decisively defeat the U.S. aggressors, resolutely seizing the final victory in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

When Mao's telegram was delivered to the factories in Hanoi, the workers and cadres were overjoyed and deeply moved.

A worker and militia member from the Hanoi Electric Machinery Factory, Chen He, who had been transferred from the South to the North, told the reporter, "Chairman Mao's high evaluation of our struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation in his telegram has greatly encouraged us and further inspired us to move forward." He said, "Chairman Mao pointed out in his telegram, 'No matter how big or small a country is, as long as it fully mobilizes the people and firmly relies on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated.' Chairman Mao's words have further strengthened our iron will to defeat U.S. imperialism."

The head of the first "Socialist Labor Team" and labor model, Nguyen Thi Mai Khanh, said, "Chairman Mao's telegram is a great encouragement to our Vietnamese people. We have a reliable and vast rear like China, and we are even more determined to drive U.S. imperialism out of Vietnam."

A secretary of the factory, Thanh Nui, who had participated in the resistance in the South, said, "Chairman Mao's telegram is not only an encouragement to the people of South Vietnam but also to all Vietnamese people. It is also an encouragement to all people around the world who are fighting for national liberation. All Vietnamese people who are engaged in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation are infinitely grateful to Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people for their support. We pledge to contribute all our strength to liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the country." He sincerely wished Chairman Mao good health and longevity.

A worker and militia member from the Tam Hiep Electric Machinery Factory, Vu Xy, after hearing Chairman Mao's telegram on the radio, immediately found the newspaper and read the telegram several times, feeling more and more happy and excited. He said, "Our struggle against U.S. aggression has always received the concern and great support of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people. We sincerely express our gratitude. Chairman Mao's telegram is a great encouragement to the people of both South and North Vietnam, greatly enhancing our confidence in overcoming various difficulties and achieving the final victory."

The deputy director of the factory, Nguyen Cong Tam, said, "Chairman Mao said in his telegram, 'Your struggle is our struggle. Seven hundred million Chinese people are the strong backing of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear of the Vietnamese people.' This fully embodies the fraternal bond between our two peoples. We Vietnamese people who are fighting on the front lines against U.S. aggression are deeply moved by these words and are more confident in our struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation." He said, "We promise Chairman Mao and the Chinese people that on the road ahead, no matter what difficulties we encounter, the people of our country on the front lines of the struggle against U.S. aggression will not disappoint the expectations and concern of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people. We are determined to overcome all difficulties and thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors."

The workers, youth, and women of the Kim Sa Rubber Factory, after reading Chairman Mao's telegram, wrote pledges one after another, expressing their determination to produce and fight better to repay Chairman Mao's concern and support.

A female worker from the factory, Ho Kim Trang, said, "After reading Chairman Mao's telegram, we feel that the people of Vietnam and China are not only geographically connected but also our hearts are closely connected. On behalf of the women of our factory, I promise Chairman Mao and the Chinese people that we will definitely fulfill the 'three guarantees' task."

A trade union cadre, Cheng Su, said, "As Chairman Mao pointed out in the telegram, 'All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will inevitably make desperate struggles. They will certainly adopt various military adventurism and political deception to save their own doom. And the revolutionary people, before they achieve the final victory, will inevitably encounter various difficulties, but these difficulties are all surmountable, and no difficulties can stop the advance of the revolutionary people. Persistence is victory.' Chairman Mao's words are the absolute truth."

A worker from the Hong Ha Stationery Factory, an advanced worker, and deputy commander of the militia, Tran Thi Yen, said, "Chairman Mao's words in the telegram are very affectionate, making us very excited. The great and precious support of seven hundred million brotherly Chinese people has greatly encouraged our people to defeat the U.S. aggressors." She said, "At a time when the news of victories from both South and North Vietnam is frequently reported, Chairman Mao's telegram has further increased the strength of the youth and militia members of our Hong Ha Stationery Factory to produce and fight. We pledge to always hold the hammer and the gun, determined to fight bravely."

The trade union secretary of the Hanoi Transportation Bureau, Chen Kien, who had been transferred from the South to the North, said, "At a time when our struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is extremely fierce, Chairman Mao's telegram is a great and precious encouragement to all Vietnamese people, especially to our compatriots in the South, making us on the front lines of the struggle against U.S. aggression more confident that we will definitely achieve the final victory." He also, on behalf of the cadres transferred from Saigon to the North, sincerely thanked Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people who wholeheartedly support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialist aggressors.

The cadres of the rural district of Tan Lien, on the outskirts of Hanoi, who were in a meeting, immediately burst into prolonged, enthusiastic applause and cheers upon hearing Chairman Mao's telegram. The secretary of the Tan Lien County Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, Vu Hoa My, said, "Under the guidance of Comrade Hu, our people always remember that we can defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors because we have the great and sincere aid of seven hundred million Chinese people led by Comrade Mao. The victory of the Vietnamese people is also the victory of the Vietnam-China combat friendship."

A Vietnamese People's Army officer, Shang, said, "We are very happy to hear Chairman Mao's telegram. The U.S. imperialists will be terrified." Many Vietnamese comrades also told the reporter: Chairman Mao's telegram greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and strikes a heavy blow to the arrogance of U.S. imperialism. Victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!

In Baghdad, Vietnamese students studying abroad read the telegram from the great leader Chairman Mao to the Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho, from the news dispatch of Xinhua News Agency, and were extremely excited. With boundless love for Chairman Mao, they carefully studied and discussed Chairman Mao's telegram to Nguyen Huu Tho and wrote down the full text of the telegram in their notebooks.

From North Vietnam, Phan Quoc Bao said, "Chairman Mao's words are all truths. I will learn and always remember what Chairman Mao said in the telegram." He also said that Chairman Mao's telegram fully expresses the iron will of seven hundred million Chinese people to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

From South Vietnam, Phi Dang Lien said, "Chairman Mao's great concern for our struggle against U.S. aggression is the greatest happiness for us, the people of South Vietnam. Although our conditions are very difficult, we will follow Chairman Mao's teachings in the telegram and resolutely persist in the struggle until we drive the U.S. aggressors out of our country."
