Mao Zedong Thought is Like the Sun

When the news that the Arabic version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" had arrived in Yemen spread, the Yemeni people eagerly sought this red treasure from Chinese friends. Some made phone calls, some wrote letters, and some even visited in person to request it. The revolutionary people of Yemen regard the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as the gem among gems. Many readers of Xinhua News Agency dispatches wrote in saying: We love to read the quotations from Chairman Mao in the news dispatches. Mao Zedong Thought is like the sun, shining wherever it goes. An officer praised the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as "shining like a jewel." A news reporter who had just arrived in Yemen from Aden said: "The first thing that impressed me when I arrived in Taiz was that many young people were wearing Chairman Mao badges on their chests and holding the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' in their hands."

A Yemeni student said: Some of my classmates often gather on Sundays to study and discuss the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." We all agree that Chairman Mao is a great revolutionary leader. For us, the question is how to apply Mao Zedong Thought to the actual struggle in Yemen.

　　毛泽东思想象太阳
    当《毛主席语录》阿文版来到也门的消息传开以后，也门人民争先恐后地向中国朋友索取这本红色宝书。有的打电话，有的写信，有的亲自登门索取。也门革命人民把《毛主席语录》看成是宝中之宝。许多新华社新闻稿的读者来信说：我们非常爱读新闻稿上的毛主席语录，毛泽东思想就象太阳一样照到那里那里亮。一位军官称颂《毛主席语录》“象宝石一样闪闪发光”。一位刚从亚丁来也门的新闻记者说：“我一到塔伊兹，给我印象最深的是，许多青年人胸前戴着毛主席像章，手里拿着《毛主席语录》。”
    一位也门学生说：我的一些同学星期日经常在一起学习讨论毛主席语录。我们一致认为，毛主席是一位伟大的革命领袖。对我们来说，就是怎样把毛泽东思想运用到也门的实际斗争中去。
