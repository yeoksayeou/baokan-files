The Johnson administration of the U.S. imperialists, which has already exhausted all its tricks and is at its wits' end in the Vietnam War, has recently colluded with the Soviet revisionist clique to hatch a plot to have the United Nations Security Council "discuss" the Vietnam issue. They aim to make the United Nations, which they control, intervene in the Vietnam issue, and at the same time, use the United Nations to stage a "peace talk" charade to create public opinion and shirk responsibility for further expanding the Vietnam War.

In September of this year, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Goldberg, in his first speech at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, once again revealed the U.S. imperialists' attempt to have the United Nations intervene in the Vietnam issue. Since then, Goldberg has maintained contact with representatives of the Soviet revisionists, Britain, and other satellite countries, frequently holding secret talks. On November 30, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a formal resolution urging the government to find ways to have the Security Council "discuss" the Vietnam issue. Using this as an excuse, Goldberg has recently intensified his activities in this regard. On December 8, a U.S. spokesman announced that the United States had begun "informal" talks with other Security Council members on the issue of bringing the Vietnam issue to the Security Council. On the same day, the United Nations spokesman also confirmed this news; on the same day, Goldberg held a secret meeting with United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, reportedly to "study how to convene the Security Council to discuss the Vietnam issue."

To carry out this evil plot, the U.S. official propaganda machine has fabricated and spread rumors that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam demands to send representatives to the United Nations, attempting to confuse the issue and deceive the public. Following this, the U.S. State Department issued a statement, saying that the United States "does not object" to representatives of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam going to the United Nations.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, which has always actively served the U.S. imperialists' "peace talk" charade, has once again played a very unseemly role in this new plot of the United States, again exposing its counter-revolutionary hypocrisy of pretending to support but actually betraying on the Vietnam issue. According to reports, after Goldberg's "exploration" of the Security Council members, United Nations diplomats revealed that the Soviet Union "will not oppose (the Security Council) discussing the Vietnam issue." The U.S. Christian Science Monitor also pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leaders had hinted that "Hanoi and the National Liberation Front should use the United Nations platform to plead their case." This indicates that the Soviet revisionist clique is trying to lure the Vietnamese people into the U.S. trap. In coordination with the U.S. plot, Soviet revisionist diplomats have recently been vigorously advocating the use of the "ceasefire to lure into talks" deception trick in the United Nations.

The U.S. plot to use the United Nations to extinguish the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle has a long history. As early as August 1964, when the Johnson administration brazenly fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin incident to carry out military provocation and war blackmail against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Johnson government had adopted the tactic of "the guilty party accusing first," demanding that the Security Council defend its aggression; in early 1966, while vigorously playing the "bombing halt" trick, the United States again submitted a proposal to the Security Council, formally demanding that the Security Council "discuss" the Vietnam issue. Now, the United States is once again bringing out such a scheme that has been repeatedly rebuffed, fully reflecting the United States' current dilemma of being at a loss in the Vietnam War. For three years, the Vietnam War has been continuously "escalated," but the United States' failures have become increasingly severe; one "peace" trick follows another, but none have succeeded. It now wants to further expand the war, but militarily it is troubled by insufficient manpower, economically it is beset with difficulties, and politically, domestic and international opposition is growing stronger.

It is precisely against this extremely difficult background that the Johnson administration has come up with the idea of using the Security Council to "discuss" the Vietnam issue to realize its long-unsuccessful "peace talk" plot. It even attempts to use this plot to directly link the Vietnam issue with the United Nations, so that the United States can use the "United Nations" flag, as it did in the Korean War, to cover up its face of aggression, ease its current political and moral isolation, and at the same time, coerce more satellite countries to send troops to somewhat make up for the United States' shortage of manpower in Vietnam.

It is worth noting that while the Johnson administration is actively plotting to have the Security Council "discuss" the Vietnam issue, Washington has recently been frequently issuing war cries to invade North Vietnam, expand the Vietnam War to the entire Indochina, and even China; on the other hand, the old hand in the U.S. "peace talk" charade, U.S. President's roving ambassador Harriman, has recently gone to Yugoslavia and other countries to peddle new "peace talk" plots. From this, it is not difficult to see that the Johnson administration is currently intensifying its two-pronged strategy of inducement and coercion, and the plot of "Security Council discussion" is one of the links in this strategy.

However, everyone knows that the so-called "United Nations" is merely a tool of U.S. imperialism and has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue. This is the consistent and firm position of the entire Vietnamese people, and it is also the consistent position of the seven hundred million Chinese people and the just public opinion of the world. No matter how the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists collude and join forces, their plots are doomed to fail!

　　妄图借联合国搞“和谈”骗局　为扩大侵越战争开脱罪责
　　美帝勾结苏修让联合国插手越南问题
　　苏修积极配合美帝诱降阴谋，鼓吹要越南派代表去联合国，诱使越南人民上圈套
    新华社十二日讯　本社记者报道：在侵越战争中已经黔驴技穷、走投无路的美国约翰逊政府，最近勾结苏修领导集团，加紧策划由联合国安全理事会“讨论”越南问题的阴谋，企图使它们控制的联合国插手越南问题，同时借机在联合国搞“和谈”骗局，为美国进一步扩大侵越战争制造舆论和开脱罪责。
    今年九月，美国驻联合国代表戈德堡在本届联合国大会上的第一次发言中，就曾再一次透露美帝企图让联合国插手越南问题。在那以后，戈德堡同苏修、英国及其他仆从国家的代表一直就此保持接触，不时进行密商。十一月三十日，美国参议院外交委员会通过一项正式决议，要求政府设法让安理会“讨论”越南问题。以此为由，戈德堡最近大大加紧了这方面的活动。十二月八日，美国发言人宣布，美国已开始同安理会其他理事国“非正式地”会谈关于把越南问题提到安理会去的问题。九日，联合国发言人也证实了这一消息；同一天，戈德堡同联合国秘书长吴丹举行了密谈，据透露，是“研究如何召开安理会讨论越南问题”。
    为了推行这一罪恶阴谋，美国官方御用宣传机器大肆编造、散布所谓越南南方民族解放阵线要求派代表到联合国去的谣言，企图混淆视听，迷惑人心。接着，美国国务院又煞有介事地发表声明，说什么美国“不反对”越南南方民族解放阵线代表去联合国。
    一向积极为美帝“和谈”骗局效劳的苏修领导集团，在美国的这一新的阴谋中，再次扮演了极不光彩的角色，又一次暴露了它在越南问题上假支持、真出卖的反革命嘴脸。据报道，在戈德堡对安理会成员进行了一番“探索”之后，联合国外交人士透露，苏联“不会反对（安理会）讨论越南问题”，美国《基督教科学箴言报》还就此指出，苏修领导人曾经暗示，“河内和民族解放阵线应当利用联合国讲坛来申诉他们的理由”。这表明，苏修集团正企图诱使越南人民上美国的圈套。同美国的阴谋相配合，苏修集团外交官最近还在联合国大力鼓吹再次玩弄“停战诱和”的欺骗花招。
    美国企图利用联合国扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的阴谋由来已久。早在一九六四年八月，美国悍然制造北部湾事件对越南民主共和国进行军事挑衅和战争讹诈的时候，约翰逊政府就曾采取“恶人先告状”的手法，要安理会为它的侵略罪行辩护；一九六六年初，美国又在大力玩弄“停炸”阴谋的同时，又在安理会提出一项提案，正式要求安理会“讨论”越南问题。如今，美国再次搬出这样一个屡遭碰壁的“方案”，这充分反映了美国目前在侵越战争中进退维谷、走投无路的困境。三年来，侵越战争不断“升级”，美国的失败却越来越惨重，“和平”花招一个接着一个，但一个也没有得逞；它现在要进一步扩大战争，但在军事上苦于兵力不足，经济上困难重重，而在政治上，国内外人民的反对越来越强烈。
    正是在这种极端困难的背景下，约翰逊政府异想天开地企图通过安理会“讨论”越南问题的方式，来实现它一直没有得逞的“和谈”阴谋。它甚至企图通过这一阴谋使越南问题同联合国直接挂钩，以便于美国象侵略朝鲜时那样，用“联合国”这面破旗来遮盖自己的侵略面孔，缓和它目前在政治上、道义上的孤立，同时，裹胁更多的仆从国出兵，以多少弥补美国侵越兵力不足的弱点。
    值得注意的是，在约翰逊政府积极策划安理会“讨论”越南问题的同时，华盛顿最近不时发出入侵越南北方，把侵越战争扩及整个印度支那、甚至中国的战争叫嚣；另方面，美国策划“和谈”骗局的老手、美国总统巡回大使哈里曼最近再次去南斯拉夫等国活动，兜售新的“和谈”阴谋。由此不难看出，约翰逊政府目前正在加紧它诱降、迫降的反革命两手策略，所谓“安理会讨论”的阴谋就是其中的一环。
    但是，谁都知道，所谓“联合国”只不过是美帝国主义的一个侵略工具，它根本无权过问越南问题。这是全体越南人民一贯的严正立场，也是七亿中国人民以及全世界公正舆论的一贯立场。无论美帝、苏修如何勾结一起狼狈为奸，它们的阴谋都是决不能得逞的！
