	Study style is a question of the leadership organs, all cadres, and all Party members' methods of thinking, a question of our attitude toward Marxism-Leninism, and a question of the attitude of all Party comrades toward work. Since this is the case, the question of study style is a very important question, the first important question.

	Unlimited Loyalty to Chairman Mao, Establishing a Revolutionary Good Study Style

	— Representatives of the Air Force Directly Affiliated Organs and Troops' Conference on Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works Study and Discuss the People's Daily Editorial

	Representatives of the Air Force Directly Affiliated Organs and Troops' Conference on Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works, with high political enthusiasm, seriously studied the People's Daily editorial "Vigorously Conduct Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes." In the discussion, everyone agreed that to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, as the editorial pointed out, it is necessary to establish the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary good study style advocated by Chairman Mao.

	Study Style is the First Important Question

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of study style is a question of the leadership organs, all cadres, and all Party members' methods of thinking, a question of our attitude toward Marxism-Leninism, and a question of the attitude of all Party comrades toward work. Since this is the case, the question of study style is a very important question, the first important question." The representatives said, this is an absolute truth. The most important aspect of the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary good study style personally advocated by Chairman Mao is to link theory with practice, which is what Vice Chairman Lin expounds: studying Chairman Mao's works, one must study with problems in mind, apply the learning actively, combine learning with application, learn what is urgently needed first, and see immediate results. The key is to focus on the "use" of what is learned. Whether to use Mao Zedong Thought or not is the fundamental question, an attitude question, a stance question, and a dividing line between complete revolutionaries and verbal revolutionaries. The progress and achievements we have made in studying Chairman Mao's works are all the result of following Chairman Mao's teachings and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to learn and then apply. Studying Chairman Mao's works is to use them; learning without using is equivalent to not learning. Learning without using is being a verbal revolutionary.

	Many representatives who have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes pointed out that the People's Daily's editorial, which raises the issue of establishing a revolutionary good study style, is timely and very important. Nowadays, Mao Zedong Thought study classes are being conducted throughout the country. To conduct these classes well, a very important condition is to establish the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary good study style personally advocated by Chairman Mao. We have personal experience in participating in these study classes. Studying Chairman Mao's "Old Five Articles" and the latest instructions, one must combine learning with application and see immediate results. Chairman Mao's instructions must be executed seriously, implemented item by item, and followed sentence by sentence. Where this is done, there are results; where this is not done, there are no results. Therefore, to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, the first important thing is to focus on the question of study style and establish a revolutionary good study style.

	The Essence of the Study Style Question is the Question of Loyalty to Chairman Mao

	The representatives said, whether to use Mao Zedong Thought or not is essentially a question of attitude toward Chairman Mao, a question of loyalty to Chairman Mao. We have felt that the reason we can learn a little and use a little of Chairman Mao's works is because we have unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty toward Chairman Mao. We firmly believe in Chairman Mao's words and follow his instructions sentence by sentence. A true revolutionary who is loyal to Chairman Mao must be a complete revolutionary who links theory with practice, firmly executing what is understood of Chairman Mao's instructions and also firmly executing what is not yet understood, deepening understanding in the process of execution. Not using Chairman Mao's instructions after learning them is disloyalty to Chairman Mao.

	The representatives especially pointed out that the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders under his protection have done everything possible to oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, spreading the rotten study style of theory detached from practice, advocating closed-door cultivation and reflection detached from real class struggle. The black goods of Chinese Khrushchev have caused great harm and deep poison. We must thoroughly criticize and cleanse their poison.

	Revolutionary Good Study Style is Fought For

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there is no construction; without blocking, there is no flow; without stopping, there is no progress." The revolutionary good study style is not naturally and peacefully produced and developed; it is fought for. Only by fighting the rotten bourgeois and revisionist study styles with the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, fighting constantly and repeatedly, can the revolutionary good study style be firmly established.

	Representatives who have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes said that the entire process of conducting these classes is a process of thoroughly establishing Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao. Some cadres, in studying with soldiers, workers, and family members, initially had reservations, feeling embarrassed to expose their shortcomings in front of soldiers, workers, and family members. Through study, they gradually realized that the revolutionary good study style advocated by Chairman Mao is to link theory with practice and conduct serious self-criticism. Cadres and soldiers studying together can teach and learn from each other, promoting each other. Therefore, they decided to expose their shortcomings without fear of embarrassment and fight against selfishness without fear of pain, digging deep to the root and firmly establishing the public spirit.

	The representatives said, Vice Chairman Lin is Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms and best student, a shining example of actively applying Chairman Mao's works. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, establishing a revolutionary good study style and accelerating the realization of thought revolutionization.

	(From Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd)

	Participants of the Air Force Directly Affiliated Organs and Troops' Conference on Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works enthusiastically study the important editorial of the People's Daily "Vigorously Conduct Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes." They are determined to establish in their actions the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary good study style personally advocated by Chairman Mao, actively applying Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions, executing them seriously, combining learning with application, and seeing immediate results.

### 无限忠于毛主席，建立革命好学风——空军直属机关、部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表学习座谈《人民日报》社论

专栏：

    学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。				毛泽东
    无限忠于毛主席，建立革命好学风
    ——空军直属机关、部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表学习座谈《人民日报》社论
    空军直属机关、部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表，以高昂的政治热情，认真学习《人民日报》社论《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》。在座谈讨论中，大家一致认为，要办好毛泽东思想学习班，正如社论所指出的，必须建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风。
    学风问题是第一个重要的问题
    毛主席教导我们：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”代表们说，这是千真万确的真理。毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，最重要的就是理论联系实际，就是林副主席阐述的学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫。学习毛泽东思想，用还是不用，这是根本问题，态度问题，立场问题，是区分完全革命派和口头革命派的分水岭。我们学习毛主席著作所以有一点进步和成绩，都是按照毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示，学了就用的结果。学习毛主席著作就是要用，学了不用，等于不学。学了不用，就是口头革命派。
    许多参加过毛泽东思想学习班的代表指出，《人民日报》发表社论，提出建立革命好学风的问题，真是及时雨，太重要了。现在全国各地普遍举办了毛泽东思想学习班。要把毛泽东思想学习班办好，很重要的一条就是必须建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风。我们参加学习班学习对此有切身体会。学习毛主席的“老五篇”和最新指示，必须学用结合，立竿见影，对毛主席的指示，一定要认真执行，条条落实，句句照办。凡是这样做了的，就有成效；凡是不这样做的，就收不到效果。所以，要办好毛泽东思想学习班，第一重要的就是要狠抓学风问题，建立起革命好学风。
  学风问题的实质是对毛主席忠不忠的问题
    代表们说，学习毛泽东思想，用还是不用，实质是对毛主席的态度问题，是对毛主席忠不忠的问题。我们体会到，对毛主席著作之所以能够学一点用一点，就是因为我们对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚，对毛主席的话，坚信不疑，对毛主席的指示，句句照办。一个真正忠于毛主席的革命战士，必然是理论联系实际的完全革命派，对毛主席的指示，理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的也坚决执行，在执行中加深理解。对毛主席的指示，学了不用，就是对毛主席的不忠。
    代表们特别指出，中国赫鲁晓夫及其庇护下的党内一小撮走资派，千方百计反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，散布理论脱离实际的腐朽学风，鼓吹脱离现实阶级斗争、脱离实际的闭门修养，闭门思过。中国赫鲁晓夫这一套黑货，害人不浅，流毒很深。我们必须彻底批判，肃清其流毒。
      革命好学风是斗出来的
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。革命好学风不是自然和平安地产生和发展起来的，而是斗出来的。只有用毛主席倡导的革命学风同腐朽的资产阶级、修正主义学风斗，经常斗，反复斗，才能使革命好学风牢固地树立起来。
    参加过毛泽东思想学习班的代表说，我们办学习班的整个过程，就是大立毛泽东思想的过程，大立毛主席倡导的革命的学风的过程。有的干部在同战士、职工、家属一起学习，一起亮私斗私中，开始有顾虑，觉得在战士、职工、家属面前亮私难为情。通过学习，逐步认识到了毛主席倡导的革命好学风，就是要理论联系实际，要进行认真的自我批评，干部、战士一起学习，可以互教互学，互相促进。因此，他们下决心做到亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕痛，根子挖得深，公字立得牢。
    代表们说，林副主席是毛主席的亲密战友、最好的学生，是活学活用毛主席著作最光辉的榜样，我们一定要以林副主席为榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，树立革命好学风，加速实现思想革命化。
