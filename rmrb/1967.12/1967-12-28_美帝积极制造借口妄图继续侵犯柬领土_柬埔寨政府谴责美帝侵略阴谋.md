U.S. Imperialism Actively Fabricates Excuses to Continue Violating Cambodian Territory
Cambodian Government Condemns U.S. Aggression Plot

	New Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 26th - According to a report from the Cambodian News Agency, the Royal Government of Cambodia responded on the 20th to a verbal note from the U.S. Government, which was conveyed through the Australian Ambassador to Cambodia on the 4th. In the reply, the Royal Government of Cambodia strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for fabricating excuses and plotting to continue violating Cambodian territory and airspace. It also warned the U.S. Government: "Cambodia is determined to fight to the end against any military action on its territory under any pretext."

	The reply noted that the entire argument in the U.S. Government's verbal note was based on the claim that "Vietnamese are the aggressors in their own country." This is obviously unacceptable to the Royal Government of Cambodia.

	The reply sternly pointed out that the facts are that the U.S. "has been interfering in the internal affairs of South Vietnam since 1955, and since 1962, has waged a war of destruction and massacre against the entire Vietnamese people." The U.S. armed intervention in South Vietnam, not to mention the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, is outright aggression. The U.S. military intervention in the countries of Indochina, with unprecedented barbaric methods, aims to suppress the wishes of the people of Indochina for complete independence and territorial integrity. However, the U.S. tries to portray this as its "legitimate right."

	In the reply, the Royal Government of Cambodia strongly refuted the U.S.-fabricated lie that the armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation movement have "invaded" Cambodian neutrality. The note stated: "There are no foreign armed forces stationed on Cambodian territory." "No international law or international convention allows the U.S. Government to meddle with the Royal Government on this issue."

	The reply pointed out that the only obvious fact is that U.S. aggressor forces, South Vietnamese puppet forces, and Thai accomplice forces have invaded and attacked Cambodian territory by land and air.

    美帝积极制造借口妄图继续侵犯柬领土
    柬埔寨政府谴责美帝侵略阴谋
    新华社金边二十六日电　据柬埔寨新闻社报道，柬埔寨王国政府二十日对美国政府四日通过澳大利亚驻柬埔寨大使转达的口头照会提出了答复。在复照中，柬埔寨王国政府强烈谴责美帝国主义制造借口，阴谋继续侵犯柬埔寨的领土和领空，并且警告美国政府：“柬埔寨决心全力以赴来抗击以任何借口对它的领土发动的军事行动”。
    复照指出，美国政府口头照会中的全部议论所依据的说法是“越南人是越南自己国家的侵略者”。这显然是柬埔寨王国政府所不能接受的。
    复照严正指出，事实是美国“从一九五五年以来就干涉南越的内部事务，从一九六二年起就对全体越南人民进行了一场大肆破坏和屠杀的战争”，“美国对越南南方的武装干涉，更不用说对越南民主共和国的轰炸，就是不折不扣的侵略。”美国“对印度支那各国进行军事干涉，以空前的野蛮手段企图扑灭印度支那各国人民要求完全独立和领土完整的愿望。”但是美国却极力把这个作法说成是它的“合法的权利”。
    柬埔寨王国政府在复照中严厉驳斥了美国制造的越南南方解放武装力量“侵犯”柬埔寨中立的无耻谰言。照会说：“在柬埔寨的领土上根本没有驻扎任何外国武装部队。”“没有任何一项国际法或国际公约使美国政府能就这个问题同王国政府纠缠。”
    复照指出，唯一明显的事实是，美国侵略军、南越傀儡军和泰国帮凶军对柬埔寨领土进行了地面和空中的入侵和进攻。
