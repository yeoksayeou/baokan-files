Edition: 4

The great commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved and conferred the honorable titles of "Model Unit for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" upon the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong. This has greatly inspired the support-left personnel of the 8341 Unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the Beijing Knitting Factory. In their study and discussion session, they resolutely declared: They must take the heroes as their example, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resolutely and unconditionally carry out every battle command of Chairman Mao. They will respond swiftly and implement Chairman Mao's latest directives, completing the support-left tasks assigned by Chairman Mao and achieving new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    Like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, be utterly loyal to Chairman Mao and never leave his side

Support-left personnel Chen Bingrong, who has been actively promoting Mao Zedong Thought, has been warmly received by revolutionary workers. However, he feels that compared to the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, he still has a long way to go. He said:

    Our great commander Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have set a brilliant example of supporting the left and loving the people for our army. This is the greatest care, the greatest inspiration, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for our army.

    The Heroic Fourth Platoon is a heroic collective nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Their iron-clad oath: "Where Chairman Mao loves, I love; where Chairman Mao supports, I support; where Chairman Mao commands, I obey; where Chairman Mao waves, I advance," expresses the hearts of all officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries," and it is also our common iron-clad oath.

    The essence of these four iron-clad oaths is utter loyalty to Chairman Mao. Only by being utterly loyal to Chairman Mao can one fulfill these four iron-clad oaths; only by fulfilling these four iron-clad oaths can one be utterly loyal to Chairman Mao. I am far behind the comrades of the Heroic Fourth Platoon. I will take them as my example, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and firmly establish utter loyalty to Chairman Mao in my mind. I will act according to Chairman Mao's instructions in everything and do my work better.

Support-left personnel Wang Fenglin, who has made achievements in revolutionizing with the workers and laboring together, was deeply moved by the glorious deeds of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong. He said:

    In his final moments, Comrade Li Wenzhong told the comrades who rushed to save him, "Don't mind me, save the Red Guards!" This earth-shaking statement expressed his utter loyalty, faith, admiration, and devotion to Chairman Mao, and showed the noble qualities of a great communist. His glorious image will forever live in our hearts.

    Comrade Li Wenzhong and his comrades could, in the moment when the party and the people needed them to sacrifice, fearlessly face danger because they harbored deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, and, as Chairman Mao taught, established a worldview of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Their heroic deeds are the most powerful criticism of the traitorous philosophy and survival philosophy of China's Khrushchev! Learning from the heroes means being like them, "living to fight for Chairman Mao, dying to sacrifice for Chairman Mao," and being like them, harboring utter loyalty to Chairman Mao, mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly establishing a communist worldview.

Support-left personnel Lian Xuesen firmly supported the left without supporting factions, actively guiding the revolutionary workers of the trial production workshop to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve revolutionary great unity. He said:

    Learning from the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong means being like them, firmly believing in, following, and never leaving Chairman Mao's instructions; understanding them and executing them, and even if not understanding them temporarily, executing them and gradually deepening understanding in the process of execution. For revolutionary mass organizations, regardless of which faction, if they align with Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, support them firmly; if they do not align with Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, do not support them, and guide the masses to correct them using Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Only in this way can the support-left work be done well.

    Like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, break with selfishness at the core and establish public-mindedness at the root

Support-left personnel Liu Maian received fourteen letters and four telegrams from his family, informing him of his father's serious illness and death, urging him to return home immediately. Leaders and comrades repeatedly advised him to go back and take care of things. However, he believed: No matter how big personal matters are, they are small matters; no matter how small revolutionary matters are, they are big matters. He resolutely decided not to return home and firmly guarded his support-left post. The glorious example of Comrade Li Wenzhong moved him. He said:

    Comrade Li Wenzhong and his comrades, in their final moments, thought not of themselves but of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's Red Guards. Therefore, they gained the greatest fighting power and became the bravest, most selfless, and fearless people. The glorious deeds of Li Wenzhong and his comrades show that the highest standard of the proletarian "public" is utter loyalty to Chairman Mao, which is Chairman Mao's instructions followed.

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding the theory of Marxism, one must master it and apply it; the purpose of mastering is fully to apply." Whether to use what one has learned from Chairman Mao's works or to execute Chairman Mao's instructions is a matter of class feelings and fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To use and to execute means to consciously break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to spark a revolution in one's soul, and to launch an offensive against "selfishness."

    Comrade Li Wenzhong and his comrades firmly supported every strategic deployment, every battle command, and every great instruction of Chairman Mao, earnestly learned and deeply understood them, and carried them out resolutely and unconditionally, sentence by sentence. They have set a glorious example for us. Comparing ourselves with the heroes, although we are by Chairman Mao's side, our thoughts are still far from Chairman Mao's teachings. I must be like them, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and the "Three Articles" as a motto, proactively launching an offensive against "selfishness." Break with selfishness at the core, establish public-mindedness at the root, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and strive to be a person without any selfishness or personal gain.

Support-left personnel Yang Hongcheng regarded the support-left process as a process of learning from the worker masses and realizing ideological transformation, fearing no mistakes and correcting them when wrong. He linked his thoughts and said with deep feelings:

    The Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, in the days and nights of supporting the left, always lived, learned, labored, and fought with the revolutionary masses, being the little students of the masses, and set a glorious example for us to closely connect with the masses, and also set an example for us to break with selfishness and realize ideological transformation.

    Looking back, when I first entered the factory, due to not fully understanding the revolutionary actions of the broad masses and not clearly seeing my own shortcomings, I later followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "going among the masses," laboring and studying Chairman Mao's works with the workers, and fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. In this way, both Mao Zedong Thought was propagated, and the subjective world was transformed in the struggle practice.

    The glorious deeds of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong made me once again realize that only by always being with the revolutionary masses can one have the stance, thoughts, feelings, and revolutionary spirit of the left; only by always being with the revolutionary masses can one better learn, propagate, execute, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; only by always being with the revolutionary masses can one, in practice, recognize, test, temper, and transform oneself, constantly break with selfishness and spark a revolution in one's soul, accelerating ideological transformation.

    Like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, always and everywhere spread Mao Zedong Thought

Support-left personnel Wang Ruihua, following Chairman Mao's teaching to "care for the masses' lives," frequently went deep into the workshops and the workers' living areas, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and treating workers' illnesses. The deeds of Comrade Li Wenzhong and his comrades rescuing Red Guards deeply moved her. She said:

    The Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong are indeed models for supporting the left and loving the people. They support the left at the key points and love the people at the root. This key and root are Mao Zedong Thought. Using Mao Zedong Thought to arm, educate, and help the revolutionary masses is the greatest support for the left and the greatest love for the people.

    In the process of supporting the left, we assisted the factory's medical department to go to the workshops for round-the-clock medical care and to the dormitories to treat the workers' families. We deeply felt that treating patients, in addition to prescribing the right medicine, is more importantly giving patients spiritual strength with Mao Zedong Thought. Learning from the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong means being like them, always and everywhere propagating and instilling Mao Zedong Thought into the revolutionary masses, letting the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought deeply take root in the minds of the broad revolutionary masses.

Support-left personnel Ren Honglian, in the factory's half-work half-study school, actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought and established a deep class feeling with the Red Guards. He said:

    The Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong have many places worth learning from, but the most fundamental is to learn from them how to eagerly and actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's worldview, and using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary youngsters.

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Tens of thousands of martyrs, for the people's interests, have heroically sacrificed their lives in front of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward on their bloodstained path!" We learn from the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, and we must be like them, unyieldingly loving the Red Guards, wholeheartedly helping the Red Guards, and arming the minds of the Red Guard youngsters with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Support-left personnel Zhang Shuying, in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and, together with the students, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism. At the discussion meeting, she, linking her revolutionary practice, said excitedly:

    The Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong are brilliant examples of carrying out Chairman Mao's great instruction of "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses"! They can "wherever they go, leave a red line, wherever they stay, leave a red area" because they always and everywhere spread Mao Zedong Thought, help the revolutionary masses actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and arm the minds of the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought.

    At present, we have already helped the revolutionary workers set up six Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Everyone uses Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, the "Three Articles" as the fundamental textbook, and "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline. From the height of the two-line struggle, they find the root of "selfishness," investigate the crimes of "selfishness," expose "selfishness," and firmly establish "public-mindedness." Their spiritual faces have undergone great changes. However, compared to the heroes, we still have a long way to go. We must forever take them as our example, making the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary masses as our most fundamental and long-term support-left task, letting Mao Zedong Thought open everyone's heart, letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position, and turning the factory into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

　　不折不扣地执行毛主席每一项战斗命令
　　——人民解放军驻北京针织总厂支左人员向英雄四排和李文忠同志学习座谈纪要
    伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准，授予英雄四排和李文忠同志以“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”的光荣称号，极大地鼓舞了人民解放军八三四一部队驻北京针织总厂支左人员。他们在学习座谈中坚决表示：一定要以英雄为榜样，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决地、不折不扣地执行毛主席的每一项战斗命令，闻风而动、立竿见影地贯彻毛主席的一切最新指示，圆满地完成毛主席交给的支左任务，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
    象英雄四排和李文忠那样对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离
    支左人员陈秉荣，平时积极宣传毛泽东思想，受到了革命职工的欢迎。但是他感到同英雄四排和李文忠相比，还差很远。他说：
    我们伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，为我军指出了一个支左爱民的光辉榜样。这是对我军最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的激励，最大的鞭策。
    英雄四排是毛泽东思想哺育成长的英雄集体。他们的钢铁誓言：“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”，说出了战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的全体指战员的心里话，也是我们共同的钢铁誓言。
    这四句钢铁誓言的根本，就是对毛主席赤胆忠心。只有无限忠于毛主席，才能实现这四句钢铁誓言；只有实现这四句钢铁誓言，才是无限忠于毛主席。我同英雄四排的同志们相差很远，决心以他们为榜样，破私立公，在头脑里牢固地树立起对毛主席的无限忠诚，处处按照毛主席的指示办事，把工作做得更好。
    支左人员王凤林在同工人一起闹革命、一起劳动中，作出了成绩。英雄四排和李文忠的光辉事迹，使他深受感动。他说：
    李文忠同志在生命的最后一刻，对赶来救他的同志说：“不要管我，救红卫兵要紧！”这句震撼山河的话，表达了他对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的赤胆忠心，表现出一个伟大共产主义战士的高贵品质。他的光辉形象永远活在我们的心里。
    李文忠同志和他的战友，能够在党和人民需要他们献身的最后一刻临危不惧，是因为他们怀着对毛主席最最深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，象毛主席教导的那样，树立了“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的世界观。他们的英雄行为，是对中国赫鲁晓夫叛徒哲学、活命哲学的最有力的批判！向英雄学习，就要象他们那样，“生为毛主席战斗，死为毛主席献身”，就要象他们那样，怀着对毛主席的无限忠心，把毛泽东思想学到手，牢固地树立起共产主义的世界观。
    支左人员连学敏，坚决支左不支派，积极引导试制车间的革命职工，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，实现革命的大联合。他说：
    学习英雄四排和李文忠同志，就要象他们那样，对毛主席的指示，要坚信，紧跟，寸步不离；理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行，在执行中逐步加深理解。对于革命群众组织，不管那一派，凡是符合毛泽东思想、符合毛主席伟大战略部署的，就坚决支持，凡是不符合毛泽东思想、不符合毛主席伟大战略部署的，就不支持，并且引导群众用毛泽东思想加以改正，紧紧跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署。只有这样，才能把支左工作做好。
    象英雄四排和李文忠那样破私破在要害处，立公立在根本上
    支左人员刘懋安，家里一连来了十四封信和四封电报，告诉他父亲重病和死亡的消息，要他火速回家。领导和同志们一再劝他回去料理料理。但是他认为：个人的事再大也是小事，革命的事再小也是大事。他毅然决定不回家，坚守支左岗位。李文忠的光辉榜样激动着他。他说：
    李文忠同志和他的战友在生命的最后一刻，想到的不是自己，而是毛主席，是毛主席的红卫兵。因此，他们获得了最大的战斗力，成为最勇敢、最无私、最无畏的人。李文忠和他的战友的光辉事迹说明，无产阶级“公”字的最高标准，就是无限忠于毛主席，就是毛主席的指示我照办。
    毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”学了毛主席著作用还是不用，听了毛主席指示执行还是不执行，这是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的阶级感情问题，根本态度问题。要用，要执行，就要自觉地破私立公，在灵魂深处爆发革命，向“私”字打进攻战。
    李文忠同志和他的战友对毛主席的每一个战略部署，每一个战斗号令，每一个伟大指示，都坚决拥护，认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办，句句照办，给我们做出了光辉的榜样。看英雄，比自己。自己虽然身在毛主席身边，但思想离毛主席教导的还相差很远。我一定要象他们那样，以毛泽东思想为武器，以“老三篇”为座右铭，向“私”字主动出击。破私，“破在要害处”，立公，“立在根本上”，永远忠于毛主席，努力做一个毫无自私自利之心的人。
    支左人员杨宏成，把支左过程，当成向工人群众学习、实现思想革命化的过程，不怕犯错误，错了就改。他联系自己的思想实际，深有体会地说：
    英雄四排和李文忠同志，在支左斗争的日日夜夜，始终和革命群众生活在一起，学习在一起，劳动在一起，战斗在一起，做群众的小学生，为我们密切联系群众树立了光辉榜样，也为我们破私立公，实现思想革命化树立了榜样。
    回想自己刚进厂时，由于对广大群众的革命行动不很理解，对自己的缺点，也看不清楚。后来，遵循毛主席“到群众里面去”的教导，和工人一同劳动，一同学习毛主席著作，一同斗私批修。这样，既宣传了毛泽东思想，又在斗争实践中改造了主观世界。
    英雄四排和李文忠同志的光辉事迹，使我再一次体会到，只有始终同革命群众在一起，才能有左派的立场，左派的思想，左派的感情，左派的革命精神；只有始终同革命群众在一起，才能更好地学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；只有始终同革命群众在一起，才能在实践中认识自己，考验自己，锻炼自己，改造自己，不断地破私立公，在灵魂深处爆发革命，加速思想革命化。
    象英雄四排和李文忠那样时时处处传播毛泽东思想
    支左人员王瑞华，遵循毛主席要“关心群众生活”的教导，经常深入车间和职工家属住区，宣传毛泽东思想，给工人看病。李文忠和他的战友抢救红卫兵的事迹，使她深受感动。她说：
    英雄四排和李文忠同志，不愧是支左的模范，爱民的标兵。他们支左支在关键上，爱民爱在根本上。这关键，这根本，就是毛泽东思想。用毛泽东思想武装、教育、帮助革命群众，是最大的支左，最大的爱民。
    在支左过程中，我们协助工厂的医务室，下车间给职工巡回医疗，深入宿舍给职工家属看病，我们深深感到，给病人看病，除了对症下药以外，更重要的是用毛泽东思想给病人以精神力量。学习英雄四排和李文忠同志，就要象他们那样，时时处处向革命群众宣传、灌输毛泽东思想，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想在广大革命群众的头脑中深深扎根。
    支左人员任洪连，在工厂的半工半读学校，积极宣传毛泽东思想，和红卫兵建立了深厚阶级感情。他说：
    英雄四排和李文忠同志值得我们学习的地方很多，但最根本的，是要学习他们如饥如渴地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众和革命小将的头脑。
    毛主席教导我们说：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”我们学习四排和李文忠同志，就要象他们那样，始终不渝地热爱红卫兵，满腔热忱地帮助红卫兵，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装红卫兵小将的头脑。
    支左人员张淑英，在毛泽东思想学习班里，以毛泽东思想为武器，和学员一道斗私批修。座谈会上，她结合自己这段革命实践，激动地说：
    英雄四排和李文忠同志，是执行毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”伟大指示的光辉典范！他们能够“走过那里红一线，住到那里红一片”，就是因为时时处处传播毛泽东思想，帮助革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众的头脑。
    目前，我们已经帮助革命职工办了六期毛泽东思想学习班，大家以毛主席的最新指示为武器，以“老三篇”为根本教材，以“斗私，批修”为纲，从两条路线的高度，找“私”字的根源，查“私”字的罪状，搞臭“私”字，大立“公”字，精神面貌发生了很大变化。但是，比起英雄们来，我们还做得很差，我们要永远以他们为榜样，把向革命群众宣传毛泽东思想，做为我们支左工作最根本、最长远的任务，让毛泽东思想打开每个人的心窍，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
