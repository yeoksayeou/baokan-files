Over ten thousand middle school revolutionary teachers and students in the capital held a rally to swear allegiance to studying the heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres of the proletariat from all over the country, in studying the advanced deeds of the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army and Comrade Li Wenzhong, the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People," have taken the heroes as their examples, further launching a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, step by step following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and determining to win a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the hometown of the Red Guards rescued by the heroic Fourth Platoon, the revolutionary masses of the Jiangxi People's Commune in the suburbs of Nanchang City, with the heroes as their mirrors, are fighting against selfishness and establishing public spirit, achieving outstanding results in revolution and production. The poor and lower-middle peasants of three revolutionary mass organizations in Shitan Commune, Fengcheng County, after studying the heroes' deeds, said: Li Wenzhong is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, sacrificing his life. What wrong things do we have that we are reluctant to give up? They exposed their thoughts, fought against selfishness, and quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.
