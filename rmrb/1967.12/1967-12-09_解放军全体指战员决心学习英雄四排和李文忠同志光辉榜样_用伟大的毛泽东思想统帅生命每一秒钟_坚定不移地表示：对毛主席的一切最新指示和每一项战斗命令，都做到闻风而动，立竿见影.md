The broad masses of officers and soldiers from the various headquarters of the PLA, various military branches, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industry Office, and the Beijing Military Region leadership organs held various meetings last night and today.

At the meetings, the officers and soldiers pointed out that the heroic Fourth Platoon is a collective of heroes who highhold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, who are highly conscious of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and who are brilliant examples of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Learning from the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong means to be like them, loving Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the most deeply and following them the closest. Mao's good soldier Nian Siwang said at a meeting of more than 6,000 revolutionary masses in the Beijing units of the General Logistics Department that the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong have, through their actual actions, achieved "If Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; if Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; if Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow; if Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance." We learn from them and must be like them, infinitely loving, believing, admiring, and being loyal to Chairman Mao, and better studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning a little and using a little, combining learning with application, seeing immediate results, and letting the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought guide every second of our lives.

Amidst enthusiastic cheers, the officers and soldiers unanimously declared that they would definitely take "Criticizing Revisionism and Repudiating Self" as the key link, learn from the heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, and for all of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and every battle order, they would definitely act immediately and see results instantly. They would steadfastly advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Today, more than 7,000 people from the army, navy, and air force units stationed in Tianjin held a meeting. The responsible comrade of the garrison, Yang Yinsheng, and representatives from the army, navy, and air force solemnly declared at the meeting that they would definitely learn from the heroic Fourth Platoon, firmly support and defend the leftists, and resolutely fight for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and die for it.

The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Railway Corps working in a high-altitude forest area held an oath-taking meeting with local residents and forestry workers this afternoon. Zhang Chunyu, a hard-boned soldier of the Railway Corps, said at the oath-taking meeting: The reason why the heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong have become a brilliant banner of supporting the left and loving the people is fundamentally because they have infinite faith and absolute loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

They go everywhere using Mao Zedong Thought to support the left, "wherever they pass, a red line appears, wherever they stay, a red area appears," truly being our learning example. The units where martyrs Qiu Shaoyun, Lü Xiangbi, and Xie Chen served, as well as the garrison troops in Guangzhou, Nanchang, Changsha, and Hainan Island, summed up their experiences and lessons in the work of "Three Supports and Two Militaries" in learning and discussion, and resolved to learn from the Fourth Platoon, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the work of "Three Supports and Two Militaries," and in the struggle between the two lines, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.
