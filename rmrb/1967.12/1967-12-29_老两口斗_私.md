The Party branch of the 2nd Company of the 3228th Unit of the People's Liberation Army recently held a story-telling evening to discuss the current situation through the lens of Mao Zedong Thought. Cadres and soldiers shared many touching stories based on their experiences during the Cultural Revolution. These vivid stories reflected the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution in rural areas from various angles.

The Old Couple's Battle Against "Private Interests"

Sixth Squad Leader Li Yizhong

One day, I went to Zhangjiazhuang Production Brigade near our station to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. On the wall of poor peasant Li's home, I saw the following words: “Without fighting against private interests, people will change; without criticizing revisionism, the country will change. To be loyal to Chairman Mao, one must not have even the slightest private interest. Long live Chairman Mao!” Although the characters were not very neat, they deeply attracted me. When Li returned, I curiously asked, “Grandpa, how did you come up with these words?” Li took out a bag of tobacco, took a few puffs, and smilingly said to me, “To answer this, I have to start with my wife. On National Day this year, didn't Vice Chairman Lin convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions on Tiananmen Square, saying ‘We must fight against private interests and criticize revisionism’? My wife just heard it on the radio and said to me, ‘Old man! This is what Chairman Mao said. We poor and lower-middle peasants must follow it word for word and take the lead!’ That very day, we two old folks made a plan to ‘grasp private interests.’ Since then, whenever I had a bit of private interest, she would grab it; whenever she had a bit of private interest, I would grab it too. Later, we both started to grab our own private interests.”

I asked, “Grandpa, how exactly did you grab private interests?” Li said, “There's a lot to say about this! Take me for example! In the past, I always felt that being the brigade leader, not getting a salary, and not getting more work points, might offend people. Once, someone challenged me, and I wanted to quit. This thought was grabbed by my wife. She said, ‘Fear of criticism from the masses and calculating personal gains and losses is putting private interests first. Having private interests is being disloyal to Chairman Mao.’ My wife's words reminded me, and I used Chairman Mao's ‘Three Articles’ to fight against this private interest, determined to take up the heavy burden again. I didn't let her private interests go either. Once, many chickens were eating corn in the field, and my wife only drove away the chickens from our brigade's field, but not those from the neighboring brigades' fields. I grabbed this incident and said she had private interests, an expanded private interest. Since then, my wife has been careful in everything, not letting private interests interfere. To always remember to fight against private interests and criticize revisionism, my wife had our twelve-year-old granddaughter write down her feelings in a few words and pasted them on the wall. Later, I felt it wasn't enough, so I added ‘Long live Chairman Mao!’ in big characters.”

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is truly worth twenty years of the past! Grandpa's words deeply educated me. I silently resolved to fiercely fight against private interests, thoroughly criticize revisionism, and forever be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

### 老两口斗“私”

    解放军三二二八部队二连党支部，最近召开了一次用毛泽东思想看形势的故事晚会。干部、战士根据自己在文化大革命中的所见所闻，讲了许多动人的故事。这些生动的故事，从各个侧面反映了农村无产阶级文化大革命的一片大好形势。
    老两口斗“私”
    六班长　李义忠
    一天，我到驻地附近的张家子生产队去宣传毛泽东思想，在贫农李大爷家里的墙上看到这样几句话：“不斗私，人要变，不批修，国要变。要忠于毛主席，就不能有半点私。毛主席万岁！”虽然这些字写得不大工整，却把我深深吸引住了。李大爷一回来，我便好奇地问：大爷，这几句话，您是怎样写出来的呢？李大爷装了袋烟，吸了两口，笑着对我说：要问这个，还得从俺老伴那里说起。今年国庆节那天，林副主席不是在天安门城楼上传达了毛主席的最新指示“要斗私，批修”吗！俺那老伴刚从收音机里听完，就对我说：老头子！这是毛主席他老人家说的，咱贫农下中农可要字字句句照办，一马当先呀！当天，我们老两口就订了一个“抓私”计划。打那以后，我有点“私”，她就抓；她有点“私”，我也揪住不放。后来，我们俩都自己抓自己的“私”了。
    我问：大爷，你们到底是怎么抓“私”的呢？李大爷说：这说起来可就多啦！就拿我来说吧！过去总觉得当队长，既不拿工资，也不多拿工分，弄不好还“得罪”人。一次，有人顶了我，我就想甩手不干了。这个活思想，被老伴抓住了。她说：“怕群众提意见，计较个人得失，这就是‘私’字当头。有‘私’，就是对毛主席他老人家不忠。”老伴几句话提醒了我，我就用毛主席的宝书“老三篇”来斗这个“私”字，决心重新担起重担子。我也不放松她的“私”。有一次，很多鸡在地里吃高粱，俺老伴只把在自己生产队里吃高粱的鸡撵跑了，在挨边的其他生产队地里的鸡，她却没撵。我抓住了这件事，说她这是“私”，是扩大了的“私”。打那以后，俺老伴事事处处注意，不让“私”字作怪。为了念念不忘斗私批修，老伴就叫十二岁的小孙女把她的体会写成了几句话，贴在了墙上。后来我觉得不够劲，又添上了“毛主席万岁！”这五个大字。
    无产阶级文化大革命真是一天等于过去的二十年啊！李大爷的一席话深深地教育了我。我暗暗下决心，要狠狠斗私，彻底批修，永远做毛主席的好战士。
