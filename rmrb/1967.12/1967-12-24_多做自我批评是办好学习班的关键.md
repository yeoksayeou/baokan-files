Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has instructed us in his latest directives: "Both sides should speak less about the shortcomings and mistakes of others, let others speak for themselves, and each side should engage in more self-criticism, seeking great unity and preserving minor differences." This is a powerful ideological weapon for us to run study classes well.

From the situation of our factory holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, some comrades have many active thoughts when they come to the study classes. Some are afraid of self-criticism, while others want to criticize others. In response to these active thoughts, we organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest directives, emphasizing the importance of self-criticism. After studying, everyone corrected their attitudes towards learning, clarified the purpose of learning, and laid a good ideological foundation for deepening self-criticism.

Study should combine theory with practice, and what is learned should be applied. The comrades in the study class openly revealed their shortcomings and mistakes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution without hesitation, summarized experiences, and drew lessons. A worker who had once taken the wrong side, before the study, did not understand the movement. In the study class, he saw many comrades consciously raising their criticism to the level of the struggle between the two lines and fighting against their selfishness. He voluntarily checked himself, saying: "Comrades are rising up to rebel against Chinese Khrushchev, I am an old worker, not only did I not come out early, but I also became an obstacle; comrades criticizing me is politically caring for me, what do I have to be confused about?" Some comrades present, hearing this heartfelt self-examination from an old worker who had suffered greatly in the old society, were deeply moved and voluntarily checked themselves for not helping him enough, deeply excavating the revengeful sentiments in their hearts. This practice of both sides engaging in self-criticism truly eliminated ideological barriers among everyone and strengthened unity.

Combining internal and external activities in the study class is an effective method to promote self-criticism. Our approach is: on one hand, for those who have done well in self-criticism in the study class, we let them hold reporting meetings in the entire factory to inspire everyone to engage in self-criticism. On the other hand, for those whose ideological knots are temporarily unresolved and whose self-criticism is poor, we send them to the workshops and departments, where comrades who understand each other do patient ideological and political work. This approach has played a good role in promoting self-criticism. For example, some comrades, in order to help others resolve their knots, had heart-to-heart talks seven or eight times, eliminating barriers between each other. In this way, the entire factory created an atmosphere where everyone cares about the study class, which is both a supervision and an encouragement for the comrades participating in the study.

To spread the self-criticism learning style that has initially formed in the study class, we propose requirements for the students at the end of each study class: to bring back the revolutionary good learning style, to be propagandists of combining theory with practice and self-criticism.

Now, Mao Zedong Thought part-time study classes have blossomed throughout the factory in various workshops and small groups. The revolutionary new learning style of combining theory with practice and self-criticism is being grasped and applied by more and more workers.

    多做自我批评是办好学习班的关键
    北京第三轧钢厂革命委员会
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在最新指示中教导我们：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”这是我们办好学习班的强大思想武器。
    从我们厂举办毛泽东思想学习班的情况来看，有些同志到学习班来是有不少活思想的。有的怕自我批评，有的想批评别人。针对这样的活思想，我们组织大家反复学习毛主席最新指示，强调多做自我批评。经过学习，大家端正了学习态度，明确了学习目的，为深入开展自我批评打下了良好的思想基础。
    学习要理论联系实际，学了就要用。学习班里的同志把自己在文化大革命运动中的缺点、错误，毫不犹豫地亮了出来，总结经验，吸取教训。一个曾经站错了队的工人，在学习以前，对运动很不理解。在学习班上，他看到许多同志自觉地提到两条路线斗争的高度来斗私，也就自动检查说：“同志们起来造中国赫鲁晓夫的反，我是老工人，不但没有及早地站出来，反而做了拦路虎；同志们批评我，这是从政治上关心我，我还有什么想不通的呢？”在场的一些同志，听了这个饱尝旧社会苦难的老工人出自肺腑的检查，十分感动，便主动检查了自己对他帮助不够，深挖了思想深处的报复情绪。这种双方都作自我批评的做法，使大家真正从思想上消除了隔阂，加强了团结。
    学习班的内外活动有机地配合起来，是推动自我批评的一个有效的方法。我们的做法是：一方面，在学习班双方自我批评作得好的，就让他们在全厂范围内举行讲用会，来带动大家进行自我批评。另一方面，凡在学习班双方思想疙瘩一时解不开，自我批评较差的，就让他们到车间科室去，由相互了解的同志，耐心地做思想政治工作。这样做，对促进各自作自我批评，起了良好的作用。如有的同志，为了帮助同志解疙瘩，七次、八次地去交心谈话，相互消除了隔阂。这样，就在全厂造成了一种人人关心学习班的空气，对参加学习的同志既是一种督促，也是一种鼓舞。
    为了把在学习班初步形成的自我批评的学风，传播开去，我们在每期学习班结束时，就对学员提出要求：要把革命的好学风带回去，做理论联系实际、自我批评的宣传员。
    现在毛泽东思想业余学习班，已经在全厂各车间、各小组遍地开花。理论联系实际，自我批评的革命新学风，正在为越来越多的职工所掌握所应用。
