Our great leader Chairman Mao's congratulatory telegram to President Nguyen Huu Tho expresses the sentiments of us poor and lower-middle peasants. It conveys our determination to support the Vietnamese people's war against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

Our Friendship Commune in Pingxiang, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is adjacent to the great neighboring country of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sharing the same rivers and mountains. We share the same water and firewood with the Vietnamese people. Our hearts are connected with those of the Vietnamese brothers. The U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam is an aggression against us in China. The Vietnamese people have creatively applied the strategies and tactics of people's war, fighting bravely and growing stronger with each battle. They have beaten the U.S. aggressor invaders into a state of desperation and humiliation, drowning them in the vast ocean of people's war. The struggle of the Vietnamese people is our struggle; the victory of the Vietnamese people is our victory.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Seven hundred million Chinese people are the staunch rear base of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear area of the Vietnamese people." We firmly support and will carry out Chairman Mao's teachings.

We will definitely carry out a thorough revolution in the countryside, criticizing and exposing the revisionist fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "three freedoms and one contract," "exploitation is beneficial," and the "Tao Yuan experience." We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We will definitely strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, "grasp revolution and promote production," and do a good job in winter plowing and winter sowing to support our Vietnamese brothers with concrete actions. At the same time, we will definitely implement the three guarantees for the militia, hold our guns firmly, and defend the southern gate of our motherland.

We swear to be the staunch rear base of the Vietnamese people. As soon as Chairman Mao gives the order, we will cross the Friendship Pass and fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to annihilate the U.S. aggressors completely.

    越南人民的胜利就是我们的胜利
    广西壮族自治区凭祥友谊人民公社贫农下中农
    我们伟大领袖毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电，句句说出了我们贫下中农的心里话，句句表达了我们友谊关下的友谊公社广大贫下中农坚决支持越南人民抗美救国战争的决心。
    我们友谊公社与伟大的邻邦越南民主共和国田园相望，山水相连。我们与越南人民同饮一江水，共烧一山柴。我们与越南兄弟心连着心。美帝国主义对越南的侵略就是对我们中国的侵略。越南人民创造性地运用了人民战争的战略战术，越战越勇，越战越强，把美国侵略强盗打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，把他们淹没在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。越南人民的斗争，就是我们的斗争；越南人民的胜利，就是我们的胜利。
    毛主席指出：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。”毛主席的教导，我们坚决拥护，坚决照办。
    我们一定搞好农村的革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫提倡的“三自一包”、“剥削有功”、“桃园经验”等等修正主义谬论批倒、批臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们一定努力巩固无产阶级专政，“抓革命，促生产”，搞好冬耕、冬种，用实际行动支援越南兄弟。同时，我们也一定搞好民兵三落实，紧握手中枪，保卫祖国的南大门。
    我们誓作越南人民的坚强后盾。只要毛主席一声令下，我们就跨出友谊关，与越南人民并肩作战，把美国侵略者彻底消灭。
