The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association held a reception tonight in Beijing to welcome two friendly delegations from the Afro-Asian Journalists Association returning from a successful visit to eight Arab countries. The reception celebrated the victory of the revolutionary line of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association and enthusiastically hailed the widespread influence of the great Mao Zedong Thought in the Arab region.

The General Secretary of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, Chard, spoke first at the reception. He congratulated the two friendly delegations on their successful visit, noting that the visit further strengthened the fighting unity of the Asian and African peoples in their struggle against common enemies.

The two friendly delegations of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, Sugiyama Shihei and Uma Saidi, reported on their visit to the Arab countries at the reception. They introduced the excellent situation of the anti-imperialist revolution in the Arab region and the welcome and support of the Arab people for the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary line adopted at the Fifth Secretariat Meeting of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association. They pointed out that the revolutionary line of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association meets the needs of the people's struggle and reflects the wishes of the fighting peoples of Asia, Africa, and the Arab countries.

Sugiyama Shihei said in his speech, "We saw that the Arab people have the determination to fight to the end against American imperialism, Zionism, and reactionary forces. The Arab people openly identify American imperialism as their number one enemy and openly condemn the treacherous betrayal of the interests of the Arab people by the Soviet revisionist leadership."

He said, "The deepest impression we gained in the Arab countries is the Arab people's love for Chairman Mao and their urgent desire to learn Mao Zedong Thought. More and more Arab people are arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. We believe that the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will be victorious, and the final victory will belong to the Arab people."

Uma Saidi said in her speech, "The Arab people are increasingly aware of the sinister face of American imperialism and recognize it as their number one enemy. They also increasingly see the role played by the reactionaries and the Soviet revisionist ruling clique as agents of American imperialism."

Uma Saidi said, "During our visit, we gained a deeper understanding and stronger belief in the far-reaching influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and Mao Zedong Thought. Almost at every occasion, we heard the revolutionary masses cheering the great achievements and victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They said that this revolution further strengthens and consolidates China as the strongest bastion of the world revolution, which will promote and guarantee the victory of the world revolution."

She said, "What greatly encouraged us is that Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread in the Arab region. Mao Zedong Thought brings light to the fighting revolutionaries, and more and more people are advancing along the path indicated by the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao."

The Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, Sennanayaka, and the Vice-Chairman of the All-China Journalists Association, Tang Pingzhuo, also spoke at the reception, warmly congratulating the delegations on their successful visit.

At the reception, filled with revolutionary friendship, the guests repeatedly shouted, "Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" They also frequently toasted to the victory of the revolutionary line of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, to the anti-imperialist unity of the Asian and African peoples, and to the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

Guests invited to the reception included progressive writers from Somalia, the Somali Coast, Tanzania, Congo (Brazzaville), Mali, Southwest Africa, and Botswana who were visiting China, representatives of some liberation organizations stationed in China, and other foreign friends, as well as responsible officials from relevant departments in China and representatives of the revolutionary journalists in the capital.

    新华社十三日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处今晚在北京举行招待会，欢迎亚非新闻工作者协会派出的两个友好代表团访问八个阿拉伯国家胜利归来，热烈庆祝亚非记协革命路线的胜利，热烈欢呼伟大的毛泽东思想在阿拉伯地区日益深入人心。
    亚非记协总书记查禾多在招待会上首先致词，他祝贺两个友好代表团出访所取得的成功，指出代表团的访问，进一步巩固了亚非人民反对共同敌人斗争的战斗团结。
    亚非记协两个友好代表团的杉山市平和乌玛·赛义德，在招待会上报告了访问阿拉伯国家的情况，介绍了阿拉伯地区出现的反帝革命的大好形势，以及阿拉伯人民对亚非记协第五次书记处全会确定的反帝反修革命路线的欢迎和支持。他们指出，亚非记协的革命路线，符合人民斗争发展的需要，反映了亚非战斗人民和阿拉伯国家人民的愿望。
    杉山市平在讲话中说，我们看到阿拉伯人民都有着同美帝国主义、以色列犹太复国主义和反动势力战斗到底的决心。阿拉伯人民公开地指明美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民的头号敌人，并且公开谴责苏修领导集团对阿拉伯人民利益的罪恶的出卖行径。
    他说，我们在阿拉伯国家得到的最深的印象，是正在为取得真正的解放而进行着英勇斗争的阿拉伯人民，对毛主席的热爱和他们学习毛泽东思想的迫切心情。越来越多的阿拉伯人民正在用毛泽东思想武装他们自己。我们相信，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民必胜，最后胜利一定属于阿拉伯人民。
    乌玛·赛义德在讲话中说，阿拉伯人民越来越清楚地认识到美帝国主义的阴险面目，认识到美帝国主义是他们的不共戴天的头号敌人。他们也越来越清楚地看到美帝国主义的代理人——反动派以及苏修统治集团扮演了肮脏的角色。
    乌玛·赛义德说，代表团在访问中，更加了解到并更加坚信中国无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东思想的深远影响。几乎在每一个场合，我们都听到革命群众欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大成就和胜利。他们说，这一革命进一步加强和巩固了作为世界革命最坚强的堡垒的中国，必将促进和保证世界革命的胜利。
    他说，使我们感到极大鼓舞的是，毛泽东思想在阿拉伯地区得到广泛的传播。毛泽东思想给战斗的革命者带来了光明，越来越多的人民正在沿着世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出的道路前进。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克和中华全国新闻工作者协会副主任唐平铸，也在招待会上致词，热烈祝贺代表团出访的成功。
    在充满革命友谊气氛的招待会上，各国朋友不断高呼：“世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”并频频为亚非记协革命路线的胜利、为亚非人民的反帝团结、为中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利干杯。
    应邀出席招待会的，有正在中国访问的来自索马里、索马里海岸、坦桑尼亚、刚果（布）、马里、西南非和博茨瓦纳的进步作家，一些驻中国解放组织的代表和其他外国人士，以及我国有关方面的负责人和首都新闻界无产阶级革命派代表。
