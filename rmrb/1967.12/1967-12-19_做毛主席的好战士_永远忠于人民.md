In the unprecedentedly favorable situation where our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approved the conferring of the title "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" to the 4th Platoon of the 6th Company of a certain unit of the 601st Division, and the title "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" to the former platoon leader of the 4th Platoon, Comrade Li Wenzhong. This is the greatest care, greatest encouragement, greatest inspiration, and greatest spur that our great leader Chairman Mao has shown to all the officers and soldiers of the army. Let us sincerely wish our great leader Chairman Mao a long, long life!

The great People's Liberation Army of China, personally created and led by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is an unparalleled army of the people. This army, nurtured by the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, has produced heroes one after another and has sung one triumphant song after another of the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" is a heroic collective that emerged during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and Comrade Li Wenzhong, the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People," is an outstanding representative of this heroic collective.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is one that is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people." "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." The comrades of the 4th Platoon have always followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, correctly treated the people, relied closely on the people, and loved the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly. They have resolutely and unconditionally executed every battle order of Chairman Mao, and responded promptly to every great directive of Chairman Mao. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have always stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, sharing weal and woe with the revolutionary cadres and the revolutionary young guards of the Red Guards. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, they have written a heroic epic of supporting the left and loving the people with their lives and blood, setting a shining example for us to learn from.

Correctly Treating the People

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." Our great leader Chairman Mao has the utmost faith in the masses, cares for the masses the most, sees the great role of the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary movement of the masses the most. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the attitude towards the masses and the mass movement has always been the focal point of the struggle between the two lines. The struggle between the two lines, reflected in our minds, is a struggle between public and private interests. Only by thoroughly eliminating private interests and establishing public interests can we be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and have boundless love for the broad revolutionary masses, and only then can we advance victoriously along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the struggle to support the left.

The heroic 4th Platoon is infinitely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao and closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. They understand and execute Chairman Mao's every great directive, and even if they do not understand at first, they execute it resolutely. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was just beginning, some comrades in the 4th Platoon had misunderstandings about the revolutionary actions of the broad revolutionary masses. However, they firmly believed that this great revolution was personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and that following Chairman Mao would lead to victory. If they did not understand, it was because they had not kept up with Chairman Mao, and they would unhesitatingly correct their mistakes. They repeatedly studied the theories, lines, policies, methods, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally formulated by Chairman Mao, fought against their private interests, clarified their confused understanding, and gradually deepened their understanding of the revolutionary mass movement. When the great new thing of the Red Guards movement arose and shook the world, the comrades of the 4th Platoon were full of enthusiasm for it. When the news of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards reached the company, Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong firmly declared: Our great leader Chairman Mao supports and loves the Red Guards. If Chairman Mao loves them, I love them. If Chairman Mao supports them, I support them. If Chairman Mao instructs, I will act accordingly. If Chairman Mao waves his hand, I will advance. The words of Comrade Li Wenzhong became the iron oath of the entire platoon. They said what they meant and did what they said, supporting the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards with boundless enthusiasm.

We should, like the comrades of the 4th Platoon, correctly recognize and treat the masses according to Chairman Mao's teachings. When new things in the mass movement emerge, we should see their strong vitality, see their hope and future, praise them enthusiastically, and support them resolutely. We should firmly believe that the general direction of the revolutionary struggles of the masses is always correct, that the essence and mainstream of the revolutionary mass movement are good, and that the power of the revolutionary mass movement is endless and its future is limitlessly bright.

Relying Closely on the People

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes." "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and can be waged only by relying on them." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally led and initiated by our great leader Chairman Mao is a great political and ideological revolution that mobilizes the masses, relies on the masses, and lets the masses educate and liberate themselves. Only by firmly believing in the masses and relying on the masses can we correctly carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is a thorough line of mass work. In the revolutionary mass movement, only by resolutely and unconditionally following Chairman Mao's instructions, replacing the word "fear" with "dare," replacing "I" with "public," and replacing "believing in oneself" with "believing in the masses," can one truly understand and carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The comrades of the heroic 4th Platoon, wherever they go and whatever task they perform, always rely closely on the masses and respectfully seek their advice. The more the masses trust them, the more humble and cautious they become; the more the masses regard them as teachers, the more they are willing to be students. To be good students, they follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Everywhere you go, you should blend in with the local people, not stand above them, but blend in with them." They often study Chairman Mao's works with the masses, make revolution with the masses, and engage in production with the masses. They often listen to the opinions of the masses, consult with the masses on matters, respect the initiative of the masses, and fully mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. Because they "never leave the masses," they know best what the revolutionary masses love, hate, think, and need, so in supporting the left, they can love what the left loves, hate what the left hates, think what the left thinks, and urgently address what the left urgently needs.

The revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought the most; they hate the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists the most. The comrades of the 4th Platoon, with boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and boundless hatred for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses, use Mao Zedong Thought as a telescope and microscope to see through the tricks of the class enemies, and use Mao Zedong Thought to correctly handle contradictions among the people. In this way, they achieve the goal of the masses educating and liberating themselves. In supporting the left at the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, Li Wenzhong was in charge of the reception station for the masses. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party regarded the reception station as a "thorn in the eye" and "a bone in the throat," deceiving and inciting some uninformed masses to make trouble for the reception station. Li Wenzhong then used Mao Zedong Thought to mobilize the masses, relying on the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in the factory, to do the work of the deceived masses, and then organized the turned-around deceived masses to persuade and educate the still-deceived masses. In this way, a large number of deceived masses returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the leftist forces quickly grew stronger, the bourgeois reactionary line was completely defeated, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line achieved decisive victory.

Loving the People with All One's Heart

Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from Comrade White and his "extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people," and to educate every comrade to love the people. The people's army loves the people; this is determined by the nature of our army. Loving the people has new content and requirements in the new historical period of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao calls on us: "We must protect the left." In the struggle to support the left, being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and infinitely loving the proletarian revolutionary cadres is the greatest and best way to love the people.

The comrades of the heroic 4th Platoon love the left deeply and support the left well. They know that the proletarian revolutionary cadres are the advanced masses who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, representing the will of the masses, the fundamental interests of the masses, and the direction of social progress. From the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the comrades of the 4th Platoon have always cherished and cared for the proletarian revolutionary cadres with boundless enthusiasm and fully supported the broad masses of the left. The comrades of the 4th Platoon regard supporting and cherishing the left as their most glorious duty and as a concrete manifestation of their loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. When they were on a "military training" mission at a certain middle school, they organized the young guards of the Red Guards every day to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, nurturing the young guards with the sunlight and rain of Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle. The proletarian revolutionary cadres gratefully said: "What the comrades of the 4th Platoon say is what we want to say; what the comrades of the 4th Platoon do is what we want to do. The comrades of the 4th Platoon and we have one heart, and they are our strong backing and learning example."

Completely and Thoroughly Serving the People

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve them wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army."

Whether one can serve the people wholeheartedly is a matter of worldview, a matter of public or private interests. The proletariat puts "public" first and can be selfless and fearless, completely and thoroughly serving the people. The bourgeoisie puts "private" first and will inevitably only think of itself, always considering personal gains and losses, forgetting the whole, forgetting the 700 million Chinese people and the 3 billion people of the world. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is becoming more and more profound, the question of public or private interests is increasingly sharply posed before each of our comrades. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is a great battle between public and private interests. This battle is constantly taking place and must be reflected in the minds of each individual. We must study and apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles" thoroughly, ignite a revolution in the depths of our souls, launch a fierce offensive, thoroughly eliminate "private" interests, and firmly establish proletarian "public" interests, so that we can truly establish a proletarian worldview of serving the people.

The comrades of the heroic 4th Platoon regard the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, studying and applying them every day, starting from specific problems and from the height of worldview, never relaxing in the struggle to eliminate private interests and establish public interests. They say: "Private" is the source of all evil, and we must strengthen the dictatorship of "public" over "private," letting "public" occupy the entire mind and not leaving any room for "private." Establishing public interests means firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They say: "Revolutionary soldiers should devote themselves to the revolution and to the people. Live to serve the people's interests, die to serve the people's interests." They say: "We must build a great wall of 'public' in our minds, letting 'public' command every second of our lives." The comrades of the 4th Platoon say this and do this. They listen to Chairman Mao's words resolutely and unconditionally at any time and in any situation, doing as Chairman Mao says and striking where Chairman Mao points.

The comrades of the 4th Platoon remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Be prepared to sacrifice everything for our cause, and at any time be ready to give up one's life for it," and for the people's needs, they would fearlessly climb mountains of knives and seas of fire. On August 19th, their fearless rescue of the young guards of the Red Guards and the revolutionary masses fully demonstrated that they had no private interests at all and did not care about their personal safety. Their minds had only one "public" interest, and their hearts were filled with only the people. In this magnificent rescue battle, Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong, Deputy Squad Leader Li Congquan, and Soldier Chen Diankui, three Communist Party members, used their young lives to practice their oaths made in their lifetime: "We have only one heart with the left, not two hearts." "Defend Chairman Mao, and we will die contented!" These three heroes fought for their lives to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and died to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They lived for the people and died for the people, living greatly and dying gloriously. They truly deserve to be called good soldiers of Chairman Mao and good sons of the people.

The heroic 4th Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong will forever be our shining examples to learn from. They have made outstanding contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have done new deeds for the people. Their heroic deeds will forever be engraved in the hearts of the people. In the nationwide and army-wide campaign to learn from the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Li Wenzhong, the proletarian revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army in Jiangxi Province must respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Taking the heroic 4th Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong as examples, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and love the people," resolutely and unconditionally execute every battle order of Chairman Mao, and respond promptly to Chairman Mao's latest directives, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. With "criticizing private interests and revisionism" as the key, we will carry out a thorough criticism, consolidate and develop the great alliance, achieve the three-in-one combination, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, grasp the revolution, and promote production, striving to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to make Jiangxi Province a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

　　做毛主席的好战士　永远忠于人民
　　程世清
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的空前大好形势下，我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席亲自批准授予六○一一部队某部六连四排以“支左爱民模范排”，四排前排长李文忠同志以“支左爱民模范”的光荣称号。这是伟大领袖毛主席对全军指战员最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的激励，最大的鞭策。让我们衷心地祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和亲自领导的、林副主席直接指挥的伟大的中国人民解放军，是举世无双的人民军队。这支军队在光焰无际的毛泽东思想哺育下，英雄辈出，奏出了一曲又一曲毛泽东思想伟大胜利的凯歌。“支左爱民模范排”就是在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出的英雄集体，“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志，就是这个英雄集体的杰出代表。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”四排的同志一贯遵循毛主席的伟大教导，正确地对待人民，紧紧地依靠人民，满腔热情地爱人民，完全彻底地为人民。他们坚决地、不折不扣地执行毛主席的每一项战斗号令，对毛主席的伟大指示闻风而动，立竿见影。他们在无产阶级文化大革命中，一直坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，跟无产阶级革命派和红卫兵革命小将，风雨同舟，血肉相连，生死与共。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，他们用生命和鲜血，写下了支左爱民的英雄诗篇，为我们树立了光辉的学习榜样。
    正确地对待人民
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我们的伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最能看到群众的伟大作用，最支持群众的革命运动。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，对待群众和群众运动的态度，始终是两条路线斗争的焦点。两条路线的斗争，反映到我们的头脑里，就是一场公和私的斗争。只有彻底破私立公，才能对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线有无限的忠诚，对广大革命群众有无比的热爱，才能在无产阶级文化大革命中，在支左斗争中，始终沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进。
    英雄四排对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚，对毛主席的伟大战略部署步步紧跟。他们对毛主席的每一个伟大指示，理解的执行，一时不理解的也坚决执行。在无产阶级文化大革命刚刚开展的时候，四排有的同志对广大革命群众的革命行动也曾有过不理解。但是，他们坚信，这场大革命是毛主席亲自发动和领导的，紧跟毛主席就是胜利。自己不理解，是没有跟上毛主席，就要毫不含糊地自以为非。他们反复学习毛主席亲自制定的有关无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，狠斗私心，澄清了模糊认识，逐步加深了对革命群众运动的理解。在震撼全球的红卫兵运动兴起的时候，四排的同志对这个伟大的新生事物便满怀热情。当毛主席接见红卫兵的喜讯传到了连队，排长李文忠就坚定地表示：我们伟大领袖毛主席支持、热爱红卫兵。毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。李文忠同志的话，成了全排同志的钢铁誓言。他们说得到，做得到，满腔热情地支持红卫兵的革命行动。
    我们应当象四排同志那样，按毛主席的教导去正确认识群众，对待群众。当群众运动的新生事物冒出来的时候，就要看到它的强大生命力，看到它的希望和未来，热情地颂扬它，坚决地支持它。要坚信革命群众的斗争大方向始终是正确的，革命群众运动的本质和主流是好的，要坚信革命群众运动的力量是无穷尽的，前途是无限光明的。
    紧紧地依靠人民
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”。“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导和发动的无产阶级文化大革命，就是一场放手发动群众，依靠群众，让群众自己教育自己、自己解放自己的政治思想大革命。只有坚定地相信群众，依靠群众，才能正确地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席的革命路线，是彻底的群众路线。在革命的群众运动中，只有坚决地、不折不扣地按照毛主席的指示，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“我”字换成
  “公”字，把“相信自己”换成“相信群众”，才能对毛主席的革命路线真正理解，切实执行。英雄四排的同志，不论到哪里，执行什么任务，都紧紧地依靠群众，恭恭敬敬地向群众请教。群众越是信任他们，他们越是谦虚谨慎；群众越是把他们当先生，他们越是甘当小学生。为了当好小学生，他们遵照毛主席的教导：“每到一地，就和那里的群众打成一片，不是高踞于群众之上，而是深入于群众之中”。他们经常和群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起闹革命，一起搞生产。他们经常听取群众的意见，遇事和群众商量，尊重群众的首创精神，充分调动群众的革命积极性。由于他们“一刻也不脱离群众”，对革命群众爱什么，恨什么，想什么，需要什么，心里最清楚，所以，他们在支左中，能爱左派所爱，恨左派所恨，想左派所想，急左派所急，帮左派所需。
    革命群众最爱的是毛主席、毛泽东思想；最恨的是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和地富反坏右。四排的同志怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和地富反坏右的无比仇恨，用毛泽东思想武装群众，用毛泽东思想这个望远镜和显微镜去识破阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，用毛泽东思想去正确处理人民内部的矛盾。这样就达到了群众自己教育自己、自己解放自己的目的。四排在江西棉纺织印染厂支左，李文忠担任群众来访接待站的工作。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把接待站视为“眼中钉”、“肉中刺”，蒙蔽、煽动一些不明真相的群众，刁难接待站。李文忠便用毛泽东思想发动群众，依靠厂里的无产阶级革命派，做受蒙蔽群众的工作，继而又组织转变过来的受蒙蔽的群众，去说服教育还没有转过来的受蒙蔽的群众。就这样，使大批受蒙蔽的群众回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，左派队伍迅速壮大，资产阶级反动路线彻底破产，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性的胜利。
    满腔热情地爱人民
    毛主席教导我们，要学习白求恩同志“对同志对人民的极端的热忱”，“教育每一个同志热爱人民群众”。人民军队爱人民，这是我军本质决定的。爱民，在无产阶级文化大革命新的历史时期，有新的内容和要求。毛主席号召我们：“要保护左派”。在支左斗争中，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，无限热爱无产阶级革命派，就是最大最好的爱民。
    英雄四排的同志，爱左爱得深，支左支得好。他们深知，无产阶级革命派是无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的先进群众，代表了群众的意志，群众的根本利益和社会前进的方向。四排同志从无产阶级文化大革命一开始，就以无比的热忱爱护关怀无产阶级革命派，全力支持左派广大群众。四排同志把支持、爱护左派当作自己最光荣的职责，看作是忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的具体表现。他们在某地中学执行
  “军训”任务时，天天都组织红卫兵小将们活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想的阳光雨露哺育小将们在斗争中成长。无产阶级革命派感激地说：“四排同志所说的，就是我们想说的；四排同志所做的，就是我们想做的。四排同志和我们心连心，是我们坚强的后盾，学习的榜样。”
    完全彻底地为人民
    毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”
    能不能全心全意为人民服务，这是个世界观问题，是为公还是为私的问题。无产阶级“公”字当头，就能无私无畏，完全彻底为人民。资产阶级“私”字当头，就必然只顾自己，处处想的是个人得失，就会忘记整体，忘记七亿中国人民和三十亿世界人民。在无产阶级文化大革命更加深入发展的今天，为公还是为私的问题，越来越尖锐地摆在我们每个同志的面前。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，就是一场公和私的大决战。这场决战每时每刻都在进行，它必然要反映到每个人的头脑里来。我们只有狠学狠用“老三篇”，在灵魂深处爆发革命，大打进攻战，彻底斗掉“私”字，牢牢立起无产阶级“公”字，才能真正确立为人民服务的无产阶级世界观。
    英雄四排的同志，把“老三篇”当作座右铭，天天学，天天用，从具体问题入手，从世界观的高度着眼，一刻也不放松破私立公的斗争。他们说：“私”字是万恶之源，必须加强“公”字对“私”字的专政，让“公”字占领整个头脑，不给“私”字留半点余地。立公就是大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威。他们说：“革命战士要一心为革命，一心为人民。”“活要为人民利益而活，死要为人民利益而死。”他们说：“要在头脑里筑起‘公’字的长城，让‘公’字统帅生命的每一秒钟。”四排同志这样说，也这样做。他们在任何时候、任何情况下，都坚决地、不折不扣地听毛主席的话，毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做，毛主席指向哪里，他们就打向哪里。
    四排同志牢记毛主席的教导：“不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业”，只要人民需要，上刀山，下火海，也在所不辞。八月十九日，他们奋不顾身抢救红卫兵小将和革命群众的英雄行为，充分说明了他们没有半点私心，毫不顾及个人的安危。他们头脑里只有一个“公”字，心里装的只有人民。在这场气壮山河的抢救战斗中，排长李文忠、副班长李从全、战士陈佃奎等三位共产党员，用年轻的生命实践了生前的誓言：“我们和左派只有一颗心，没有两颗心。”“保卫毛主席，死了也甘心！”这三位英雄，生为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而献身。他们为人民而生，为人民而死，生得伟大，死得光荣。他们不愧为毛主席的好战士，人民的好儿子。
    英雄四排和李文忠同志，永远是我们学习的光辉榜样。他们在无产阶级文化大革命中作出了卓越贡献，为人民立下了新功。他们的英雄事迹，永远铭刻在人民心中。在全国全军开展学习“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠的活动中，我们江西省无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将、革命群众和人民解放军指战员一定要响应林彪副主席的号召：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。”以英雄四排和李文忠同志为榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，坚决地、不折不扣地执行毛主席的每一个战斗号令，对毛主席的一系列最新指示，要闻风而动，立竿见影，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，搞好革命的大批判，巩固和发展革命的大联合，实现革命的“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，加强无产阶级专政，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，为把江西省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校而奋勇前进！
