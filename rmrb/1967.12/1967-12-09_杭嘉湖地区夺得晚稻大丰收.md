In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one of China's key rice-producing areas, the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou region, following the bumper harvest of early rice, has achieved another bumper harvest of late rice. This year, the entire region's grain production, building on five consecutive years of increased output, has achieved a sixth consecutive good harvest.

Currently, counties, communes, and many production brigades in the Hangkaihu region are actively organizing classes to study Mao Zedong Thought, with over 300,000 people participating in the study. They are using the line of "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" to fiercely combat the "selfish" tendencies and to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, they are seizing the opportunity to arrange and implement the winter sowing plan. Following Chairman Mao's directive of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people," they are handing over the best grain to the state to support the country's socialist construction.

    杭嘉湖地区夺得晚稻大丰收
    在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，我国水稻重点产区之一的杭（州）、嘉（兴）、湖（州）地区，继早稻丰收之后，又夺得了晚稻大丰收。今年全区的粮食生产，在连续五年增产的基础上，获得了第六年的好收成。
    目前，杭嘉湖地区各县、各公社以及许多生产大队，正在纷纷举办毛泽东思想学习班，已有三十多万人参加了学习。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗“私”字，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。在这同时，他们还抓紧时机安排落实冬播计划，并且遵照毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，把最好的粮食交售给国家，支援国家的社会主义建设。
