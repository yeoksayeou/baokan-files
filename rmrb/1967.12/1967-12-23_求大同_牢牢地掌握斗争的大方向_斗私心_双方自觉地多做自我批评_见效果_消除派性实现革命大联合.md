The two sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, and let the other side speak about their own. Each side should engage in more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences.

The revolutionary masses of various factions in the Shenyang plant of Hongfeng Mechanical Factory, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and with the help of the stationed soldiers, have held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the focus on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." The leaders of each faction and the revolutionary masses have engaged in self-criticism, emphasized common points, fought selfishness, overcome petty bourgeois factionalism, and strengthened proletarian party spirit, effectively promoting revolutionary unity.

The factory has already held three sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Before the second session ended, the entire factory established revolutionary committees by workshop and by team from the bottom up, achieving revolutionary unity.

The experience of the revolutionary masses of various factions in the Shenyang plant of Hongfeng Mechanical Factory in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes to promote revolutionary unity is as follows:

First, in the study class, the leaders of each faction and the workers, through jointly praising the wise and correct leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, jointly praising the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, further strengthened their class feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and increased their sense of pride and responsibility as the working class. They established a sense of "publicness" and strengthened class feelings among each other. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, many minor issues were resolved.

When the study class first started, the participants had many active thoughts. How to quickly unite the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought? With the help and support of the soldiers, the study class guided everyone to start by discussing the great situation of the Cultural Revolution nationwide, in the region, and in the unit, jointly praising the great victories of the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, and jointly praising the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao. In this way, the broad revolutionary masses united in their boundless class feelings of love for Chairman Mao.

When discussing the great victories of the Cultural Revolution, everyone was excited and enthusiastic, especially when talking about the unprecedented high tide of the nationwide campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the significant improvement in the political awareness of the masses. Everyone enthusiastically shared their personal experiences. Through praise, through the contrast between the old and new societies, they exchanged their class feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, and their feelings of closeness grew. Those who previously doubted that they could not get along no longer doubted, those who previously wanted to compete for superiority no longer competed, and the atmosphere of opposition disappeared, deepening the foundation for unity.

Second, by emphasizing common points, a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment was achieved. In the process of emphasizing common points, the clearer the enemy and us boundaries became, the clearer the right and wrong boundaries became, the more harmonious the feelings became, the more "same" there was, and the less "different" there was. Proletarian party spirit was strengthened, and petty bourgeois factionalism was reduced, making the revolutionary masses' desire for revolutionary unity even stronger.

In the process of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the broad revolutionary masses clearly saw that the mutual opposition of several revolutionary mass organizations was caused by the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev. After studying Chairman Mao's great teachings that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," the comrades participating in the study class realized that to solve this problem, they must start from the "same" and emphasize common points to seek revolutionary unity.

The broad revolutionary masses were very enthusiastic about discussing common points. Everyone listed many common points, such as: defending Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line with their lives is common, resolutely overthrowing the handful of capitalist roaders within the party is common, the determination to do well in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit is common, supporting the army and loving the people is common, and seizing the revolution and promoting production is common. Because of the common fundamental points, mutual intimacy increased. In the past, you looked at me with disdain, and I was annoyed with you, but now we laugh and talk, without distinction, mutually acknowledging that the other side has grasped the big direction, mutually acknowledging that the other side is revolutionary, and the confidence in achieving revolutionary unity increased.

Third, fully trust the revolutionary masses, dare to expose contradictions, bring out the contradictions, let the masses use Mao Zedong Thought to judge them, and solve them through self-criticism. Once self-criticism is carried out, the thoughts and feelings of the broad revolutionary masses will undergo new changes, petty bourgeois factionalism will be resisted, and proletarian party spirit will be promoted.

After the study class started, the vast majority of the participants voluntarily engaged in self-revolution, fought selfishness, fought factionalism, and their thoughts and feelings became harmonious. However, there was still one organization in the factory that continued to fly its factional flag, and another organization posted a provocative big-character poster. These two incidents caused a strong reaction in the study class, almost stopping the study. Should these issues be avoided, or should this living example be seized to let everyone open their minds, fight selfishness, and fight factionalism? With the assistance of the soldiers, the study class repeatedly organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making it clear that they should "each do more self-criticism," voluntarily fight selfishness and factionalism. In the discussion, the leader of the organization that posted the big-character poster took the initiative to engage in self-criticism. Some comrades in this organization also expressed that posting this big-character poster was wrong. Through the self-criticism of the study class comrades and the promotion of internal and external work, the organization that posted the big-character poster against the other side actively covered it with a banner of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and the other organization also took down its factional flag. This incident had a great educational impact on the study class comrades. Those who previously did not believe that the other side could engage in self-criticism and doubted their sincerity in unity now believed it, and their thoughts underwent a leap, increasing their awareness of fighting selfishness, fighting factionalism, and engaging in self-criticism. Everyone voluntarily, sincerely, and seriously engaged in self-criticism, determined to pull out the nail of selfishness and factionalism, and achieve revolutionary unity.

Fourth, use typical examples to expand the learning results of the study class to the entire factory, let the masses educate themselves, and let the comrades who participated in the study class become propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the hearts of everyone.

After a period of study, the comrades who participated in the study class had a significant improvement in their thoughts and actively proposed to the entire factory the initiative to achieve revolutionary unity from the bottom up by workshop and by team, promoting the revolutionary masses of the entire factory to achieve revolutionary unity based on Mao Zedong Thought.

The comrades from the study class returned to their workshops and also propagated and encouraged the achievement of revolutionary unity to everyone, creating a situation where the masses urged the leaders and the leaders led the masses. Revolutionary unity was quickly achieved.

    两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。					毛泽东

    求大同—牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向  斗私心—双方自觉地多做自我批评  见效果—消除派性实现革命大联合
    据新华社沈阳二十二日电　红锋机械厂沈阳厂各派革命群众组织，在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，在驻厂解放军的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，各派的头头和革命群众各自多做自我批评，大摆共同点，狠斗私心，克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，有力地促进了革命的大联合。
    这个厂的各派革命群众组织已经联合举办了三期毛泽东思想学习班。第二期学习班还未结束，全厂便按班组、按车间自下而上地成立了无产阶级革命派联合委员会，实现了革命大联合。
    红锋机械厂沈阳厂各派革命群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，促进革命大联合的体会是：
    一、在学习班里，各派组织的头头和工人，通过共同颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的英明、正确的领导，共同颂扬文化大革命的大好形势，进一步增强了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，更加增强了工人阶级的自豪感和责任感，大立了一个“公”字，密切了互相间的阶级感情。在毛泽东思想统帅下，一些小是小非迎刃而解了。
    学习班刚办起来时，参加学习的人员活思想很多。如何尽快地把广大革命群众用毛泽东思想统一起来呢？学习班在解放军的帮助和支持下，引导大家从畅谈全国、本地区和本单位的文化大革命的大好形势入手，共同颂扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，共同颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导。这样，广大革命群众在无限热爱毛主席的深厚的阶级感情上统一起来。
    在畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利时，大家都为取得的光辉胜利而欢欣鼓舞，越谈越兴奋，越谈越热烈。特别是谈到全国活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动高潮空前高涨、群众政治觉悟大大提高的时候，大家都热烈地畅谈了亲身的感受。通过大颂扬，通过新旧社会对比，交流了各自对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级感情，互相看到了对方也是热爱毛主席的，听毛主席的话的，跟毛主席走的，思想感情融洽起来了。原来怀疑谈不到一块去的不再怀疑了，原来想争个高低的也不争了，对立情绪消除了，联合的思想基础加深了。
    二、互相大摆共同点，更深刻地理解毛主席的伟大战略部署。在摆共同点中，越摆敌我界限越清，越摆是非界限越明，越摆思想感情越融洽，越摆“同”字越多，“异”字越少，无产阶级党性增强了，小资产阶级派性减少了，革命群众要求革命大联合的愿望更加强烈。
    在斗私批修的过程中，广大革命群众清楚地看出：几派革命群众组织互相对立，是中国赫鲁晓夫及其推行的资产阶级反动路线造成的。参加学习班的同志在学习毛主席“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的伟大教导后，认识到要解决这个问题，必须从“同”字入手，大摆共同点，求革命的大同。
    广大革命群众谈共同点的劲头很大。大家摆了许多条共同点，例如：誓死保卫毛主席、誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线是共同的，坚决打倒党内一小撮走资派是共同的，搞好本单位斗批改的决心是共同的，拥军爱民是共同的，抓革命、促生产是共同的。由于摆出了根本的共同点，互相间更加亲密。过去你看我“不顺眼”，我对你“闹别扭”，现在有说有笑，不分彼此，互相都承认对方抓了大方向，互相都承认是革命的，实现革命大联合的信心增强了。
    三、充分相信革命群众，敢于揭露矛盾，把矛盾暴露出来，让群众用毛泽东思想去鉴别它，通过自我批评去解决它。自我批评开展起来，广大革命群众的思想感情就会发生新的变化，小资产阶级派性受到抵制，无产阶级党性得到发扬。
    学习班开学后，参加学习的绝大多数学员都自觉地进行自我革命，狠斗私心，狠斗派性，互相间思想感情融洽起来。但厂内有一个组织仍然挂着派旗，另一个组织又贴出了刺激对方的大字报。这两件事，引起了学习班强烈反应，几乎使学习停顿下来。对于这样的问题是回避它，还是抓住这个活教材，让大家敞开思想，狠斗私心，狠斗派性呢？在解放军同志的协助下，学习班反复组织大家学习毛主席的最新指示，让大家明确应该“各自多做自我批评”，自觉斗私心、斗派性。讨论中，贴大字报的这一个组织的负责人首先做自我批评。这个组织的一些同志也都表示贴这张大字报是不对的。经过学习班同志自我批评和内外工作的促进，贴对方大字报的这一个组织，主动把大字报用“斗私，批修”的大标语覆盖上了，那一个组织也把派旗降下来了。这件事对学习班同志教育很大。原来不相信对方能做自我批评，怀疑人家没有联合诚意的，这一回算是相信了，思想上发生了一个飞跃，斗私心、斗派性、自我批评的自觉性大大增强了。大家都主动、诚恳、严肃地进行自我批评，决心拔掉私心派性这颗钉子，搞好革命大联合。
    四、运用典型，把学习班的学习成果扩大到全厂，让群众自己教育自己，让参加学习班的同志成为毛泽东思想宣传员，把毛主席的最新指示落实到每个人的心上。
    参加学习班的同志，经过一段时间的学习，思想有了很大的提高，积极向全厂提出了按车间、按班组自下而上的实现革命大联合的倡议，推动全厂的革命群众在毛泽东思想的基础上，实现革命的大联合。
    学习班的同志回到车间，也向大家宣传，鼓动实现革命的大联合，出现了一个群众促头头、头头带群众的局面，革命大联合很快实现了。
