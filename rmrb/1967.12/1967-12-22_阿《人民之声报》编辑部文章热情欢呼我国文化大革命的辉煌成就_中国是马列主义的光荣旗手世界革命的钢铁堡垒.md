The editorial board of Albania's "People's Voice" newspaper published an article on December 12, enthusiastically hailing the glorious victories achieved in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong is sweeping forward with great breadth and depth. In this great revolution, the fraternal Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories on the ideological, political, economic, and cultural fronts. The irresistible revolutionary tide that has mobilized hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and revolutionary intellectuals is thoroughly smashing the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, headed by China's Khrushchev. The proletarian revolutionary line of the glorious Communist Party of China and the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong have won the complete approval and support of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses throughout China."

The article said: "The year that is about to pass was a year of victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a year of brilliant victory for the revolutionary thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, and a year in which the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, headed by China's Khrushchev, were further exposed and smashed on the political, ideological, and organizational fronts."

In discussing the victorious situation in which some provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China have achieved great unity and established revolutionary committees, the article pointed out that in People's China, the mass movement to achieve great unity and strive to establish revolutionary committees has formed a powerful army under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist line. This powerful tide is irresistible. The article said: "The great victories won by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have blocked the road to revisionism and the road to the restoration of capitalism in China, ensuring that People's China will forever remain red, forever be the banner-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, and forever be the iron bastion of revolution and socialism. For this reason, the Albanian people, all true friends of the Chinese people, and all those who cherish the cause of revolution and socialism wholeheartedly hail the glorious victories won by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The article said: "The victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has struck terror into the hearts of all those who are hostile to revolution and to the freedom and socialism of the peoples of all countries. The imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique in the Soviet Union, because their anti-China counter-revolutionary plans have failed, are furiously continuing to launch a frenzied campaign of slander and abuse against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. These mortal enemies of the Chinese people, taking their wishes for reality, prattle on about the so-called 'chaos in China,' about 'China's productive forces being in a state of stagnation,' about 'China's economy being in ruins,' and so on. But the reality in China and the victorious advance of the Cultural Revolution on the ideological, political, economic, and cultural fronts have thoroughly refuted these hysterical slanders."

The article pointed out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has powerfully promoted the development of the productive forces throughout China. At the same time as achieving victories on the ideological and political fronts, the revolutionary masses have enthusiastically carried out the battle cry of "grasp revolution, promote production" and have achieved great successes in the socialist construction of the country. On the basis of self-reliance, the Chinese people have thoroughly smashed and foiled the plots and blockade of the imperialist and revisionist enemies, building their socialist motherland into a powerful country with modern industry and agriculture, with scientific and technological achievements reaching the world's highest level, and with tremendous national defense potential.

The article went on to list irrefutable facts to illustrate the brilliant achievements made by China in industry, agriculture, and other fields. The article also pointed out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has powerfully promoted the development of science and technology and cultural education. Under the vigorous development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China successfully conducted thermonuclear and hydrogen bomb tests, shattering the nuclear monopoly of imperialism-modern revisionism. Scientists, workers, and technicians in Shanghai put the world's first synthetic benzene production line into operation, leaving the developed countries of the West behind. At the same time, the People's Republic of China last year, for the first time in the world, completely synthesized crystalline insulin, a protein with biological activity. The completion of large-scale general-purpose digital computers with transistors, the construction of fully automated top-blowing oxygen converter workshops, the production of 100,000-kilowatt water turbines, the manufacture of large solar radio telescopes and stereoscopic cameras, and so on, are all new great victories achieved in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article said, the Canton Fair is another brilliant testimony to the unceasing creativity in all fields of socialist China in the victorious advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article finally emphasized: "The glorious achievements won by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are of great significance not only to the Chinese people but also to all revolutionaries in the world. These achievements inspire the oppressed peoples in their struggle for national and social liberation, against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries. These achievements set an example for the communists and peoples of countries where the revisionist clique is in power, and give them great encouragement, showing them how to rise up in revolution, overthrow the revisionist traitors, and lead their countries back to the road of Marxism-Leninism and socialism."

    阿《人民之声报》编辑部文章热情欢呼我国文化大革命的辉煌成就
    中国是马列主义的光荣旗手世界革命的钢铁堡垒
    新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十二日发表编辑部文章，热情欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的辉煌胜利。
    文章说：“由杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命正在广泛而深入地胜利进行。在这场大革命中，兄弟的中国人民在思想、政治、经济和文化战线上取得了辉煌的胜利，把亿万工人、农民、士兵、学生和革命的知识分子发动起来的不可阻挡的革命浪潮，正在彻底地粉碎以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所代表的资产阶级反动路线。光荣的中国共产党的无产阶级革命路线和毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想，得到全中国亿万革命群众的完全赞同和拥护。”
    文章说：“即将过去的一年是中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的一年，是毛泽东同志的革命思想取得光辉胜利的一年，是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在政治、思想和组织上进一步暴露和被粉碎的一年。”
    文章在谈到中国一些省、市、自治区实现了革命大联合和建立革命委员会的胜利形势时指出，在人民中国，实现大联合和争取建立革命委员会的声势浩大的群众运动，形成了一支在毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义路线照耀下的强有力的大军。这一强大的潮流是不可阻挡的。文章说：“中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的巨大胜利杜绝了出现修正主义的道路和在中国复辟资本主义的道路，而使人民中国永不改变鲜红的颜色，永远成为马克思列宁主义的旗手，成为革命和社会主义的钢铁堡垒。正因为如此，阿尔巴尼亚人民、中国人民的一切真正的朋友、一切珍视革命和社会主义事业的人都衷心欢呼中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的辉煌胜利。”
    文章说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利开展，使所有同革命为敌的人、同各国人民的自由和社会主义为敌的人感到震惊。以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏联勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义者，由于他们的反华的反革命计划遭到失败而恼羞成怒，失望到了极点，正在不顾一切地继续发动诽谤和咒骂中国无产阶级文化大革命的狂热的运动。中国人民的这些死敌把自己的愿望当作现实，喋喋不休地谈论所谓‘正在中国发生的动乱’，谈论‘中国的生产力陷于停滞’，谈论‘经济遭到破坏’等等。但是中国的现实以及文化大革命在思想、政治和经济文化战线上的胜利进展，已经彻底粉碎了这些歇斯底里的诽谤。”
    文章指出：无产阶级文化大革命有力地推动了全中国的生产力的发展。在取得思想、政治方面的胜利的同时，无产阶级革命派热情地执行了“抓革命，促生产”的战斗口号，并且在国家的社会主义建设方面取得了伟大的成就。中国人民在自力更生方针的基础上，彻底打破和粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义敌人的阴谋和封锁，中国人民把他们的社会主义祖国建设成为一个具有现代工业和现代农业，具有达到世界水平最高峰的科学技术和巨大的国防潜力的强大国家。
    文章接着列举无可辩驳的事实，说明中国在工业、农业等各方面所取得的辉煌成就。文章还指出：中国无产阶级文化大革命强有力地推动了科学技术和文化教育的发展。在无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃开展的形势下，中国成功地进行了热核爆炸试验和氢弹试验，粉碎了帝国主义—现代修正主义的核垄断。上海的科学工作者、工人和技术人员使世界上第一个生产合成苯的车间投入了生产。这样就把西方发达国家抛在后面。同时，中华人民共和国去年在世界上第一次进行了具有生物活力的蛋白质——结晶胰岛素的完全合成。晶体管大型通用数字计算机的制成，自动化纯氧顶吹转炉车间的建成，十万瓩水轮发电机的生产，大型太阳无线电望远镜和立体摄影机的制成等等，这些都是在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中取得的新的伟大的胜利。
    文章说，广州交易会是社会主义中国在无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的形势下，在各个领域中的不断增长的创造力的又一光辉见证。
    文章最后强调说：“中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的辉煌成就，不仅对中国人民具有重大的意义，而且对世界上一切革命者也具有重大的意义。这些成就鼓舞着被压迫人民为争取民族和社会解放，反对帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派而斗争。这些成就为由修正主义集团当权的国家的共产党人和人民树立了榜样，并给予他们巨大的鼓舞，向他们指明如何起来进行革命，推翻修正主义叛徒，把他们的国家重新引向马克思列宁主义的道路和社会主义的道路。”
