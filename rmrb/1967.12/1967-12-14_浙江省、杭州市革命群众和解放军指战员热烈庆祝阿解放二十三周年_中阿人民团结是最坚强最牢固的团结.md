Chen Liyun spoke at the meeting, praising the heroic Albanian people for their steadfast adherence to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor. He said that the friendship between our two parties and peoples, forged by our great leaders Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha, is the greatest and most precious friendship in the world. Our unity is the strongest and most solid in the world. Let us stand shoulder to shoulder and fight to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in all countries, and build a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and exploitation.

Shej Peçi gave an impassioned speech at the meeting. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, has made China stronger and more consolidated, turning it into the strongest bastion of socialism and a great revolutionary base for the people of the world. Our party and people firmly support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and we wish the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people greater achievements in the socialist cause under the guidance of the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong.

Shej Peçi said that the great and eternal friendship between our two parties and peoples has been tempered in the common struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist clique. The Albanian people cherish this friendship as they would their own eyes. The meeting concluded with both sides presenting each other with banners.
