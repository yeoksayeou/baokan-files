Members of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association Friendship Delegation, who recently visited eight Arab countries, reported on their visit to Arab countries to the capital's news circles and progressive journalists from Asia and Africa in Beijing today. They enthusiastically hailed the increasing influence of Mao Zedong Thought in the Arab region.

Afro-Asian Journalists Association Secretary-General Charoen in his speech at the reporting meeting said, "The success of our delegation's visit to Arab countries has further enabled us to realize that more and more people in the world are grasping the universal truth of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' and more and more people are gaining a deeper understanding of Mao Zedong Thought."

He said, "Let us hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, oppose decadent forces, oppose imperialism, oppose old and new colonialism, oppose modern revisionism, and oppose the reactionaries. The final victory will surely belong to the people."

The reporting meeting was filled with a strong revolutionary atmosphere. A portrait of the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, was hung on the backdrop of the stage. A large red banner with the words "In sailing the seas, the helmsman is needed; in revolution, Mao Zedong Thought is needed" was hung opposite the stage.

As the reporting meeting began, revolutionary journalists from Asia and Africa, holding red revolutionary books, recited Chairman Mao's quotations in unison.

Members of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association Friendship Delegation, Sayyid Sarim, Uma Sayyid, Sugiyama Ichiro, and Zhang Guoqing, gave reports at the meeting.

Sayyid Sarim introduced the favorable anti-imperialist situation in the Arab region. He said, "Now, the Arab people have clearly recognized that U.S. imperialism is their number one enemy, and Soviet modern revisionism is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, an enemy of the Arab people and the people of the world."

Uma Sayyid, based on her observations and experiences during the visit, exposed the economic plunder of Arab countries rich in oil resources by imperialism led by the United States.

Uma Sayyid said, "More and more Arab people have realized from their own experiences that the so-called 'aid' by the Soviet Union is no different from 'U.S. aid.' The so-called 'aid' by the Soviet revisionist clique is a means of implementing its neo-colonialist policy. We have clearly seen during our visit that Mao Zedong Thought is spreading among the Arab people and is beginning to be grasped in various places, bringing enlightenment and encouragement to revolutionaries who are fighting. More and more people are advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao."

Sugiyama Ichiro introduced the situation where the revolutionary line of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association was welcomed by the people of Arab countries.

Sugiyama Ichiro said, "As long as the Afro-Asian Journalists Association holds high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adheres to the revolutionary line, and resolutely opposes U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, it can ensure close unity with the revolutionary peoples of various countries. Any plot to sabotage the Afro-Asian Journalists Association is doomed to failure."

Zhang Guoqing cited many moving examples to report to everyone about the Arab people's love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works.

He said, "The Arab people are eager to obtain 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' from the delegation. Everywhere, enthusiastic young people ask to study and discuss with us the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works. We deeply feel that in Arab countries, more and more people are using Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze what is happening around them and to solve practical problems encountered in the revolutionary struggle."

He said, "The Arab people are very concerned about the victorious progress of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They highly evaluate and praise this great revolution, initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, which is shaking the world. They are increasingly realizing that only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought can they achieve liberation."

The Secretary of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, Syria, Abu Qus, also spoke at the meeting.

Attending today's reporting meeting were members of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association Secretariat, heads of capital news units, representatives of liberation organizations in Beijing, and other Asian and African friends.

    亚非记协友好代表团成员在京作访问阿拉伯国家报告
    毛泽东思想在阿拉伯日益深入人心
    阿拉伯人民认识到只有依靠毛泽东思想才能取得解放
    据新华社二十七日讯　最近访问了八个阿拉伯国家的亚非记协友好代表团成员，今天向首都新闻界和在京的亚非进步新闻工作者作了访问阿拉伯国家情况的报告，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想在阿拉伯地区日益深入人心。
    亚非记协总书记查禾多在报告会上致词。他说，代表团访问阿拉伯国家的成功，使我们进一步认识到，世界上越来越多的人掌握了“枪杆子里面出政权”这一普遍真理，越来越多的人对毛泽东思想有了更加深刻的了解。
    他说，让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，反对腐朽势力，反对帝国主义，反对新老殖民主义，反对现代修正主义，反对反动派。最后胜利一定属于人民。
    报告会会场充满强烈的革命气氛。主席台天幕上悬挂着世界革命人民伟大领袖毛主席像，主席台对面挂着红色巨幅标语：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。
    报告会开始，亚非革命新闻工作者手捧红色革命宝书，齐声朗读毛主席语录。
    亚非记协友好代表团成员赛义德·萨里姆、乌玛·赛义德、杉山市平和张国庆在会上作了报告。
    赛义德·萨里姆介绍了阿拉伯地区出现的反帝大好形势。他说，现在，阿拉伯人民已清楚地认识到美帝国主义是他们不共戴天的头号敌人，苏联现代修正主义是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，是阿拉伯人民和世界人民的敌人。
    乌玛·赛义德以访问中的所见所闻揭露了以美国为首的帝国主义，对具有丰富石油资源的阿拉伯国家进行的经济掠夺。
    乌玛·赛义德说，越来越多的阿拉伯人民从切身的经验中认识到，苏联大肆喧嚷的“援助”本质上和“美国援助”没有区别。苏联修正主义集团的所谓“援助”是它推行其新殖民主义政策的手段。他说，我们在访问中清楚地看到，毛泽东思想正在阿拉伯人民中传播并开始在各处被掌握，给正在斗争的革命者带来启示和鼓舞。越来越多的人民正在沿着毛主席指出的道路前进。
    杉山市平介绍了亚非记协的革命路线受到阿拉伯国家人民欢迎的情况。
    杉山市平说，只要亚非记协高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，坚持革命路线，坚决反对美帝、苏修，就能保证亚非记协与各国革命人民紧密地团结起来，任何破坏亚非记协的阴谋都是注定要失败的。
    张国庆列举许多动人事例，向大家报告了阿拉伯人民热爱伟大领袖毛主席，热情学习毛主席著作的情况。
    他说，阿拉伯人民争着向代表团索取《毛主席语录》，到处都有热情的青年要求和我们一起学习和座谈学习毛主席著作的体会。我们深深体会到，在阿拉伯国家，有越来越多的人们正在用毛泽东思想来观察和分析周围发生的事情，来解决革命斗争中遇到的实际问题。
    他说，阿拉伯人民十分关注中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利进展的情况，人们高度评价和赞扬这场由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的震撼世界的革命，他们越来越清楚地认识到，只有依靠毛泽东思想，才能取得解放。
    亚非记协书记处叙利亚书记阿布库斯也在会上讲了话。
    出席今天报告会的，有亚非记协书记处成员，首都新闻单位负责人以及在京的解放组织的代表和其他亚非朋友。
