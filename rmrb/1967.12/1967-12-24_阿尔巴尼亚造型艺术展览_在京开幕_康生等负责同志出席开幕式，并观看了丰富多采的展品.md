Today, the Chinese Art Museum, where the exhibition is held, was filled with the atmosphere of the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. In the center of the exhibition hall, in front of a row of red flags, stood the statues of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people and close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. Inside and outside the exhibition hall, there were placards with quotes from Chairman Mao, which read: "Heroic Albania, a great socialist beacon in Europe." There were also placards with quotes from Comrade Enver Hoxha, which read: "The People's Republic of Albania stands like a rock, building socialism with one hand holding a pickaxe and the other a gun."

The over 160 exhibits included sculptures, oil paintings, propaganda posters, and prints. These works enthusiastically praised the wise leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and expressed the Albanian people's boundless love for their leader, Comrade Enver Hoxha. Works reflecting the Albanian people's response to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party and their progress on the road to revolutionization greatly attracted the attention of the audience. These works introduced the great achievements of the Albanian people in socialist revolution and socialist construction. Exhibits depicting Albanian partisan fighters and socialist labor heroes were highly praised by the audience.

Among the exhibits, there were also works by Albanian artists depicting images of Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers, Red Guards, workers, and commune members.
