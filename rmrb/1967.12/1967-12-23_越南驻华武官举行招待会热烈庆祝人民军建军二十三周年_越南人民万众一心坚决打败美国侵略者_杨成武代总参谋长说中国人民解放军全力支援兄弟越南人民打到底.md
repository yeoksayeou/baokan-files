Vietnamese Military Attaché Holds Banquet to Celebrate the 23rd Anniversary of the People's Army
Vietnamese People United in Defeating American Aggressors
Yang Chengwu, Acting Chief of the General Staff, Says the Chinese People's Liberation Army Will Fully Support the Vietnamese People to the End

BEIJING, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- The military attaché of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, Chen Wenping, held a banquet tonight to celebrate the 23rd anniversary of the Vietnamese People's Army.

Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the banquet.

Chen Wenping, the military attaché, and Yang Chengwu, acting chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, both spoke at the banquet.

Chen Wenping, on behalf of the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese People's Army, expressed deep gratitude to the beloved Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the great 700 million Chinese brothers and sisters.

Chen Wenping pointed out: Under the wise leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the beloved Chairman Ho Chi Minh, after 23 years of fighting and building the army, the Vietnamese People's Army has developed from a small liberation propaganda team into a powerful, modern army that is defeating and will thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

Chen Wenping said, the U.S. imperialists thought that bombs and violence could make the Vietnamese people surrender, and cunning words could deceive the Vietnamese people. However, all Vietnamese people responded to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to resist America and save the nation, united as one, for the independence, freedom, and unity of the motherland, highly developed the people's war, fought to the end, and achieved great victories of strategic significance.

Chen Wenping pointed out that the military and people of South Vietnam, under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people, and under the guidance and inspiration of the political program, responded to the call to fight to the end and win, advanced victoriously, fought fiercely, and achieved glorious victories on all fronts.

Chen Wenping strongly condemned the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism, saying that U.S. imperialism has never been as isolated, desperate, and completely failed as it is today. The development of the situation determines that the U.S. will be defeated and the Vietnamese people will be victorious. However, the warlike Johnson administration still does not want to give up its aggressive ambitions. It is playing the "peace talks" trick on one hand and threatening to expand the war to North Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos on the other.

Chen Wenping warned the American aggressors: The military and people of Vietnam are fully prepared to smash the U.S. imperialists' new war "escalation" at any time. The socialist people of the North are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the 14 million compatriots in the South to carry out the cause of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately unifying the motherland to the final victory.

Chen Wenping said, China and Vietnam are socialist brotherly neighboring countries with mountains and rivers connected. Our two peoples and armies have a long-standing traditional friendship. The 700 million Chinese brothers and sisters, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by the beloved Chairman Mao, have already and are continuing to provide great support and assistance to the Vietnamese people.

He pointed out that the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and possessing missiles and nuclear weapons, are stronger than ever. The powerful socialist China, with its modern industry, agriculture, national defense, and science and culture, and is carrying out a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, is a reliable vast rear area for the Vietnamese people.

He said, the combat friendship and brotherly assistance between the peoples and armies of the two countries of Vietnam and China are unbreakable.

Yang Chengwu, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended the warmest congratulations and combat greetings to all Vietnamese comrades fighting on the front lines of the anti-American, national salvation struggle!

Yang Chengwu pointed out that in the past year, the heroic Vietnamese people and their army, under the wise leadership of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, have continued to achieve one victory after another in the great anti-American, national salvation war for the complete liberation of the entire nation and the unification of their own country. The heroic Vietnamese people and their army, relying on their own strength, have demonstrated the boundless power of the people's war, with the revolutionary heroism of overcoming all enemies, and created miracles in the history of national liberation wars around the world. They have greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and greatly dampened the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. They have set a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations around the world to achieve liberation.

Yang Chengwu emphasized that our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." The brilliant victories of the Vietnamese people show that the people's war is the most effective, most reliable, and invincible weapon against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Whether U.S. imperialism expands military adventures or engages in political deception; whether it uses the United Nations to interfere and meddle, or colludes with modern revisionism to play the "peace talks" trick, it will not save itself from complete failure. Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared: "Bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots. Cunning words cannot deceive our compatriots. We Vietnamese people will definitely fight until there is no shadow of American aggressors on our beloved land." This is the ironclad pledge of the 31 million Vietnamese people. The final victory will certainly belong to the Vietnamese people who dare to struggle, dare to win, persist in a protracted war, and are determined to fight to the end! The days of U.S. imperialism are getting worse and worse! The day when all the people of the world will thoroughly bury U.S. imperialism will not be far off!

Yang Chengwu, when talking about the great victories achieved by the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, and the unprecedented good situation on all fronts, said that the victory of our country's proletarian cultural revolution not only opens up a bright path to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry the socialist revolution to the end, but also makes our country a stronger base for supporting world revolution. The Chinese people, tempered by the proletarian cultural revolution, have become stronger.

Yang Chengwu expressed that the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam are close comrades-in-arms who share weal and woe. Your struggle is our struggle, and your victory is our victory. Our great commander Chairman Mao teaches us: "The 700 million Chinese people are the firm backing of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear area of the Vietnamese people. In the face of the firm combat unity of the peoples of our two countries, any military adventure and political deception of U.S. imperialism are doomed to fail." The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will forever follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, fully support the Vietnamese brothers and sisters, until they thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and achieve the final victory in the anti-American, national salvation war!

Those invited to the banquet also included leaders from various departments, services, and branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and leaders from relevant departments such as Wu Faxian, Xiao Jinguang, Wang Shusheng, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Wen Yuzheng, Qiu Huizuo, Zhang Chuming, Li Zuopeng, Zhang Xiuquan, Yu Lijin, Zheng Weishan, Han Nianlong, Li Qiang, Chu Tu'nan, Ding Xilin, etc.

Ambassador Vu Minh Quan of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, Nguyen Van Khoa, head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, Nguyen Xuan Long, head of the South Vietnamese People's Delegation, and all members of the delegation, as well as diplomats and military attachés from various countries to China, also attended the banquet.

    新华社二十二日讯  越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆武官陈文彭，今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝越南人民军建军二十三周年。
    国务院副总理陈毅出席了招待会。
    陈文彭武官和中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武先后在招待会上讲话。
    陈文彭武官代表越南人民和越南人民军，向敬爱的毛主席、中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府、英雄的中国人民解放军和伟大的七亿兄弟的中国人民，表示深深的感谢。
    陈文彭武官指出：越南人民军在越南劳动党和敬爱的胡志明主席的英明领导下，经过边战斗边建军的二十三年，从一支越南解放宣传队已发展成为正在打败并将彻底打败美国侵略者的一支强大的现代化的军队。
    陈文彭武官说，美帝国主义以为炸弹和暴力就可以叫越南人民屈服，狡猾的言词就可以欺骗越南人民。但是全体越南人民响应胡志明主席抗美救国的伟大号召，万众一心，为祖国的独立自由和统一，高度发展了人民战争，决战决胜，取得了具有战略意义的巨大胜利。
    陈文彭武官指出，越南南方军民在自己唯一真正的代表——越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，在政治纲领的照耀和鼓舞下，响应民族解放阵线中央主席团的决战决胜号召，乘胜前进，猛打猛攻，在各个战场上立下了显赫的战功。
    陈文彭武官强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行，他说，美帝国主义从来没有象今天这样处于孤立、狼狈不堪和全面失败的困境。形势的发展决定了美帝必败，越南人民必胜。但是，好战的约翰逊政府还不肯放弃侵略野心，它一面玩弄“和谈”骗局，一面叫嚷把战争扩大到越南北方、柬埔寨和老挝。
    陈文彭正告美国侵略者：越南军民已作好了一切准备，随时粉碎美帝国主义的新的战争“升级”。社会主义的北方军民决心与一千四百万南方同胞并肩战斗，一定要把解放南方、保卫北方、进而统一祖国的事业进行到最后胜利。
    陈文彭武官说，中国和越南是山连山、水连水的社会主义兄弟邻国。我们两国军民有着悠久的传统友谊，七亿兄弟的中国人民在以敬爱的毛主席为首的光荣的中国共产党领导下，已经和正在给予越南人民以巨大支持与援助。
    他指出，用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想武装起来的，并掌握了导弹和核武器的中国人民和中国人民解放军，比任何时候更为强大。具有现代工业、现代农业、现代国防和现代科学文化，并正在进行轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的强大的社会主义中国，是越南人民可靠的辽阔后方。
    他说，我们越中两国人民和两国军队之间的战斗友谊和兄弟般的协助是牢不可破的。
    杨成武代表我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席，代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向战斗在抗美救国斗争最前线的全体越南战友，致以最热烈的祝贺和战斗的敬礼！
    杨成武指出，在过去的一年里，英雄的越南人民及其军队，在越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的英明领导下，为实现全民族的彻底解放和自己祖国的统一，在伟大的抗美救国战争中继续取得了一个又一个的光辉胜利。英雄的越南人民及其军队，依靠自己的力量，发挥了人民战争的无穷威力，以压倒一切敌人的革命英雄气概，创造了世界民族解放战争史上的奇迹。大长了世界革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝国主义及其走狗的威风。为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    杨成武强调指出，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”越南人民所取得的光辉胜利表明，人民战争是对付美帝国主义及其走狗最有效、最可靠、无往不胜的法宝。不论美帝国主义是扩大军事冒险，还是搞政治欺骗；不论是利用联合国插手干涉，还是加紧勾结现代修正主义玩弄“和谈”骗局，统统挽救不了它彻底失败的命运。胡志明主席庄严宣告：“炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞。狡猾的言词也骗不了我国同胞。我们越南人民坚决战斗到自己可爱的国土上没有美国侵略军的影子时为止。”这是三千一百万越南人民的钢铁誓言。最后胜利必定属于敢于斗争、敢于胜利、坚持持久战、决心战斗到底的越南人民！美帝国主义的日子越来越不好过了！全世界人民起来彻底埋葬美帝国主义的日子不会很远了！
    杨成武在谈到我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利，各条战线上都出现了空前未有的大好形势时说，我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，不仅开辟了一条巩固无产阶级专政、将社会主义革命进行到底的光明大道，而且使我国成为支援世界革命的更加强大的根据地。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，力量更加强大了。
    杨成武表示，中越两国人民和两国军队，是休戚与共的亲密战友和兄弟。你们的斗争就是我们的斗争，你们的胜利就是我们的胜利。我们伟大的统帅毛主席教导我们：“七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。在我们两国人民坚强的战斗团结面前，美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗都是注定要失败的。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，将永远遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，全力支援兄弟的越南人民，直到彻底打败美国侵略者，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利！
    应邀出席招待会的，还有中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种和北京部队负责人，以及有关方面负责人吴法宪、萧劲光、王树声、李天佑、王新亭、温玉成、邱会作、张池明、李作鹏、张秀川、余立金、郑维山、韩念龙、李强、楚图南、丁西林等。
