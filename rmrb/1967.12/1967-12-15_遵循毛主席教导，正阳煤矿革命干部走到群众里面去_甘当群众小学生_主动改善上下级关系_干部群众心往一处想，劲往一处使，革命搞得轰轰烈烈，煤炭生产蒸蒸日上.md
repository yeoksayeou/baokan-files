Following Chairman Mao's instructions, revolutionary cadres of Zhengyang Coal Mine in Jixi Mining Bureau, Heilongjiang Province, with the help of the propaganda team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, have earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's latest directives on the mass line. They have taken "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, insisting on going among the masses, humbly listening to the masses' opinions, and willingly being the masses' pupils. This has greatly enhanced the class feelings between cadres and the masses and improved the relations between superiors and subordinates. Cadres and the masses, with one heart and one mind, have made the revolution a resounding success, and coal production has been booming. Since late November, the mine has continuously over-fulfilled the daily production quota.

Some leading cadres of this mine made mistakes during the Cultural Revolution and were criticized by the masses. Most comrades have correctly recognized their mistakes, but some comrades do not understand the mass movement, are afraid to approach the masses, and have created a mental gap with them. A few even have a rebellious attitude and want to "throw in the towel."

The propaganda team analyzed these active thoughts and believed that the mental gap between cadres and the masses was mainly the cadres' responsibility. To improve the relations between cadres and the masses, they first had to start with educating the cadres. Therefore, they helped the mine revolutionary committee to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class. The study class, with Chairman Mao's latest directives as the guiding principle, closely combined with the cadres' actual thoughts, studied and applied the "Three Old Articles" thoroughly, and adopted methods such as recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, and individual heart-to-heart talks to thoroughly excavate the root of thoughts. They raised the cause of making mistakes to the height of the struggle between the two lines. Many cadres recalled the bitter history of the old society and the mine's history of blood and tears, linked it with Chairman Mao and the Party's cultivation and education of themselves, examined their mistakes over the years, and realized that the attitude towards the masses was, in essence, the attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In a certain sense, alienation from the masses was deviation from the revolution and disloyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Former trade union chairman of the Second Mine, He Fucun, deeply felt that alienation from the masses would make one unable to hear the masses' opinions and criticisms, possibly lose direction, and deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and go astray.

However, some cadres still had concerns and did not dare to boldly expose their thoughts and deeply examine their mistakes in front of the masses. Some said, "If I tell the masses about my ugly deeds, how can I work in the future!" Others said, "There is selfishness in the study class, why bother to expose it among the masses!"

At this time, the study class organized the cadres to deeply study Chairman Mao's relevant directives, making everyone realize that to improve the relations between cadres and the masses, cadres must firmly believe in the masses, and without reservation, give their hearts to the masses. They must dare to expose the "selfishness" in their souls. The cadres' awareness was raised, and they went to places where the masses had the most opinions to expose their selfishness, find comrades who had the most opinions about them for heart-to-heart talks and to seek opinions; they also exposed their thoughts and shared their feelings in study sessions with everyone. Lan Weixian, former deputy secretary of the Welfare Department who stood on the wrong side during the movement, actively went to places where the masses had the most opinions to make inspections and was warmly welcomed by the masses. He was extremely moved and said, "I used to doubt that the masses would not forgive me, but now I understand that the broad revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most reasonable. As long as cadres give their hearts to the masses, the masses will be heart-to-heart with the cadres." The common experience of these cadres is: only by placing oneself among the masses, always believing in the masses, always being the masses' pupils, accepting the masses' supervision and help at any time, can one uproot the "selfishness" in one's soul and thoroughly reform one's worldview.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes."

In the past, some cadres of Zhengyang Mine had the thought of being superior to others and could not treat people equally; they did not consult with the masses on matters; some floated above and rarely went deep among the masses. Therefore, a gap was created between cadres and the masses.

The study class, in response to this phenomenon, organized them to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line and wholeheartedly serving the people, making everyone realize that "our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the people's heads," and that cadres alienated from the masses would degenerate and change.

After raising their awareness, revolutionary cadres, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "cadres should go to the lower levels to walk around, see for themselves, insist on the mass line, consult with the masses on matters, and be the masses' pupils," walked out of their offices and went among the masses. They studied, worked, and lived with the masses, loving what the masses love, hating what the masses hate, and helping the masses where they need help. This greatly improved the relations between cadres and the masses. Many cadres formed "red pairs" with the masses and made heart-to-heart friends.

The broad revolutionary cadres deeply felt that only by being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line could they infinitely love the revolutionary masses; only by correctly treating the revolutionary mass movement, establishing the masses' viewpoint, insisting on implementing the mass line, and willingly being the masses' pupils, could they improve the relations between cadres and the masses and between superiors and subordinates.

### 遵循毛主席教导，正阳煤矿革命干部走到群众里面去　甘当群众小学生　主动改善上下级关系　干部群众心往一处想，劲往一处使，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，煤炭生产蒸蒸日上

　　遵循毛主席教导，正阳煤矿革命干部走到群众里面去
　　甘当群众小学生　主动改善上下级关系
　　干部群众心往一处想，劲往一处使，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，煤炭生产蒸蒸日上
    本报讯　黑龙江省鸡西矿务局正阳煤矿的革命干部，在人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，认真执行毛主席关于群众路线的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，坚持到群众里面去，虚心听取群众意见，甘当群众的小学生，大大增强了干群之间的阶级感情，大大改善了上下级关系。干部和群众，心往一处想，劲往一处使，革命搞得轰轰烈烈，煤炭生产蒸蒸日上，十一月下旬以来，连续超额完成日产量计划。
    这个矿的一些领导干部，在文化大革命中犯了错误，受到群众的批判。大部分同志对自己的错误都有正确的认识，但是，也有一些同志对群众运动很不理解，怕字当头，不敢接近群众，和群众产生了思想隔阂。个别人还有抵触情绪，甚至想“撂挑子”。
    宣传队同志分析了这些活思想，认为干部和群众之间产生思想隔阂，主要责任在干部身上。要搞好干群关系，首先要从教育干部入手，于是帮助矿革命委员会举办了毛泽东思想学习班。学习班以毛主席的最新指示为指针，紧密结合干部的思想实际，狠学狠用“老三篇”，并采取忆苦思甜、个别谈心等方法，狠挖思想根源，把犯错误的原因提到两条路线斗争的高度来认识。许多干部回忆旧社会悲惨的家史和矿山血泪史，联系毛主席和党对自己的培养和教育，检查自己几年来犯错误的教训，认识到对群众的态度问题，实质上就是对毛主席的革命路线的态度问题。在一定意义上讲，脱离了群众，就是背离了革命，就是对毛主席革命路线的不忠。原二井工会主任何福云深有感触地说：脱离了群众，就听不到群众的意见和批评，就可能迷失方向，离开毛主席的革命路线的轨道，就会走到邪路上去。
    可是，有些干部还有思想顾虑，不愿在群众面前大胆暴露思想，深刻检查错误。有的说：“我这些丑事和群众讲了，今后还怎么工作啊！”也有的说：“有私在学习班斗斗就得了，何必到群众中去抖落！”
    这时，学习班就组织干部深入学习毛主席的有关指示，使大家认识到，要搞好干群关系，就干部来说，必须坚定地相信群众，毫无保留地把自己的心交给群众，要敢于暴露自己灵魂深处的“私”字。干部们认识提高了，就到群众意见最多的地方去亮私、斗私，找对自己意见最多的同志谈心、征求意见；又在学习会上，和大家一起亮思想，谈感受。在运动中站错了队的原福利科支部副书记兰维先，主动到群众意见最多的地方作检查，受到了群众的欢迎。他极为感动地说，我过去怀疑群众不会原谅自己，现在才明白用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命群众，最通情达理，只要干部把心交给群众，群众就会和干部心连心。这些干部的共同体会是：只有把自己置于群众之中，永远相信群众，永远做群众的小学生，随时接受群众的监督和帮助，才能挖掉自己灵魂深处的“私”字，彻底改造世界观。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”。
    过去，正阳矿的一些干部有高人一等的思想，不能平等待人，有事不同群众商量；有些人浮在上面，很少深入群众。因此，干部和群众之间产生了隔阂。
    学习班针对这种现象，组织他们学习毛主席关于群众路线、全心全意为人民服务等教导，使大家认识到，“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷”，干部脱离群众，就会蜕化变质。
    认识提高后，革命干部遵照毛主席关于“干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，走出办公室，到群众里面去，和群众一起学习，一起劳动，一起生活，爱群众之所爱，恨群众之所恨，帮群众之所需，大大密切了干群关系。许多干部和群众结成“一对红”，交了知心朋友。
    广大革命干部深深体会到：只有对毛主席革命路线无限忠诚，才能对革命群众无限热爱；只有正确对待革命群众运动，树立群众观点，坚持贯彻群众路线，甘当群众的小学生，才能搞好干群关系和上下级关系。
