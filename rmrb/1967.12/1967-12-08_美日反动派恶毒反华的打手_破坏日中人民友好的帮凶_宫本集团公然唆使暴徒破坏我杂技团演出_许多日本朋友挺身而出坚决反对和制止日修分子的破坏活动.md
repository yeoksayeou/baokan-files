Under the protection and encouragement of the Japanese police authorities, the Goryokaku revisionist group instigated thugs and lackeys to frenziedly disrupt the performances of the Chinese Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe in cities such as Iwatase and Sapporo. The crimes of the Goryokaku revisionist group, which serves the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, opposes China, and destroys the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, have aroused the great indignation and strong condemnation of the broad masses of the Japanese people.

The Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe, praised by Japanese friends as a propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, has successfully performed in various parts of Japan, greatly inspiring and encouraging the revolutionary people of Japan in their struggle against the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and the Goryokaku revisionist group. The Goryokaku revisionist group is terrified and hates it to the core.

On the evening of November 25, the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe was successfully performing in Iwatase City. At this time, the Goryokaku revisionist group dispatched a group of thugs to sneakily come to the vicinity of the theater to distribute reactionary leaflets, slander China, defame the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe, attack the Iwatase City Welcome Committee for the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe, and obstruct and threaten the audience coming to the theater.

Japanese friends protested to the Japanese police, who were supposedly maintaining "security" at the theater, against the arrogant disruptive activities of the Goryokaku revisionist group. However, the police authorities fiercely defended the crimes of these thugs against China and the disruption of the acrobatic troupe's performance. Their shameless collusion in openly opposing China aroused the great indignation of the revolutionary people of the local area. Many Japanese friends bravely stepped forward, broke through the police's unreasonable obstruction, and resolutely stopped the thugs' disruptive activities.

The Goryokaku revisionist group, unwilling to accept their failure, again on the evening of the 26th, instigated the Hokkaido Regional Committee to gather a group of lackeys and deploy a propaganda vehicle to the theater where the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe was performing in Sapporo City, shouting and screaming wildly to frenziedly oppose China. What is even more intolerable is that the Goryokaku revisionist group also instigated thugs twice on the 27th to barge into the hotel where the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe was staying to shout anti-China slogans.

The various circles of friends in the Sapporo region angrily condemned the anti-China actions of the Goryokaku revisionist group. The chairman of the Sapporo Regional Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox), Daisuke Seiichi, pointed out that the Goryokaku revisionist group actively serves as a pitiful trumpet blower for the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Japanese reactionaries' anti-China grand chorus, which shows that they have completely degenerated into shameful traitors.

    美日反动派恶毒反华的打手　破坏日中人民友好的帮凶
    宫本集团公然唆使暴徒破坏我杂技团演出
    许多日本朋友挺身而出坚决反对和制止日修分子的破坏活动
    据新华社东京电　在日本警察当局的庇护和纵容下，宫本修正主义集团唆使暴徒和娄罗，疯狂破坏中国东方红杂技团在岩见泽、札幌等城市的演出。宫本修正主义集团为美日反动派效劳、反对中国、破坏中日两国人民友好的罪行，激起了日本广大人民的极大愤慨和强烈谴责。
    被日本朋友称颂为毛泽东思想宣传队的东方红杂技团，在日本各地的成功演出，有力地鼓舞和激励了日本革命人民反对美日反动派和宫本修正主义集团的斗争。宫本修正主义集团怕得要死，恨得要命。
    十一月二十五日晚上，东方红杂技团正在岩见泽市胜利地进行演出。这时，宫本修正主义集团指使一批暴徒偷偷摸摸地来到剧场附近散发反动传单，污蔑中国，诽谤东方红杂技团，攻击岩见泽市欢迎东方红杂技团实行委员会，并且对前来剧场的观众进行阻挠和威胁。
    日本朋友对宫本修正主义集团的这种猖狂破坏活动，向在剧场担任“警备”的日本警察提出抗议。但是，警察当局却极力为这些暴徒反对中国和破坏杂技团演出的罪行辩护。他们这种公然串通一气共同反华的无耻行径，激起了当地日本革命人民的极大愤慨。许多日本朋友挺身而出，冲破警察的无理阻挠，坚决制止了暴徒的破坏活动。
    宫本修正主义集团不甘心他们的失败，又于二十六日晚上指使北海道地区委员会，纠集一批娄罗，并出动一辆宣传车，到札幌市东方红杂技团演出的剧场门前狂喊乱叫，疯狂反对中国。尤其令人不可容忍的是，宫本修正主义集团还在二十七日两次唆使暴徒闯到东方红杂技团住的旅馆进行反华叫嚣。
    札幌地区的日本各界朋友愤怒谴责宫本修正主义集团的反华行径。日中友好协会（正统）札幌地区本部理事长大泽诚一指出，宫本修正主义集团积极充当美帝、苏修和日本反动派的反华大合唱的一名可怜的吹鼓手，这表明他们已经完全堕落为可耻的叛徒。
