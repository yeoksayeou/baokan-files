Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the armed struggle of African revolutionary people against imperialism is deepening. Armed struggle is the only path to liberation for oppressed peoples. Patriotic armed forces in some regions of Africa learn from war and grow stronger with each battle.

According to a report by our correspondent from Xinhua News Agency: The armed struggle of the African people against imperialism is further deepening. With the spread of the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought—in Africa, more and more oppressed nationalities in Africa are recognizing that Mao Zedong Thought is their most powerful weapon in their struggle for genuine independence, and that armed struggle is their only path to liberation. They are summarizing experiences and lessons from their struggles and beginning to learn and apply Chairman Mao's military thoughts in their battles.

In the Congo (Kinshasa), Mozambique, Angola, and "Portuguese" Guinea, the armed struggles against imperialism have been ongoing for a relatively long time. Some have established rural bases, while others are actively working to open up rural bases. The guerrilla fighters in these countries have been engaged in fierce "encirclement and suppression" and "counter-encirclement and suppression" battles with colonial and puppet forces. In actual combat, they find Mao Zedong's military thoughts particularly relevant.

Many guerrilla fighters in the Congo (Kinshasa) say that some of Chairman Mao's works seem to have been written specifically for the struggle of the Congolese people. After studying Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis that "revolutionary war is the people's war, only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war," the Congolese fighters began to pay attention to mobilizing the broad masses to participate in and support the armed struggle. The Political Committee of the Patriotic Armed Forces of the Western Front of the Congo (Kinshasa) published an article in its journal "Guerrilla Fighter" pointing out that the primary experience and lesson to be drawn from past struggles is the need to fully mobilize and organize the people. The article states: "Only by mobilizing and organizing the people can we change the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves. We must regard the mobilization and organization of the people's forces as the fundamental guarantee of our victory." Some leaders of the Congolese patriotic armed forces, based on Chairman Mao's teachings on the three main weapons to defeat the enemy, proposed the creation of a revolutionary party, an army led by such a party, and a united front led by such a party.

After studying the "Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention" formulated by Chairman Mao for the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Committee of Mozambique issued orders to strengthen organizational discipline, including: "All actions must obey commands," "All captured property belongs to the army," "Discussions and problem-solving should be conducted in a friendly manner," and "Borrowed items must be returned to their original owners."

Through studying Chairman Mao's works and analyzing the favorable and unfavorable factors of both the enemy and themselves in the context of Angola, the guerrilla fighters decided to launch a protracted war against Portuguese colonialism and accumulate strength to defeat the enemy in the process.

Through learning Chairman Mao's brilliant works in actual combat, many fighters in the African anti-imperialist armed struggle further recognized who the enemies and friends of the revolution are, and recognized that Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon against imperialism and revisionism. They used the microscope of Mao Zedong Thought to see through the various tricks played by the Soviet revisionist leadership on the issue of armed struggle. Some freedom fighters pointed out sharply: The Soviet revisionist clique is now continuing to use the poisons of "peaceful coexistence," "achieving independence through peaceful negotiations," and "achieving independence through the United Nations" to sedate the oppressed peoples of Africa. At the same time, to cover up their traitorous faces, they also pretend to support the armed struggle of the African people; in reality, the Soviet revisionist clique only uses the so-called support for armed struggle as a means to compromise and negotiate with imperialism, burying the people's revolutionary cause.

Patriotic armed forces in some regions of Africa learn from war and grow stronger with each battle. Many guerrilla fighters can now recite Chairman Mao's sixteen-character formula for guerrilla warfare: "When the enemy advances, we retreat; when the enemy halts, we harass; when the enemy is exhausted, we attack; when the enemy retreats, we pursue." They are beginning to apply this in practice. Thus, their combat experience is richer, and their tactics are more flexible. They often ambush enemy patrols and convoys, raid enemy camps and strongholds, and eliminate enemy combat forces.

In countries where new armed struggles have been ignited, the African people continue to achieve new victories. In Zimbabwe, under the brutal rule of the white colonial regime, African guerrilla fighters have killed and wounded hundreds of colonial troops since last April. The white colonial regime admits that since August this year, the colonial army has engaged in "the most intense battles" with the guerrilla forces. In Southwest Africa, freedom fighters have been active since last August, killing dozens of South African colonial troops.

The great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct." The awakened broad masses of African revolutionaries are advancing bravely along the only correct path indicated by Chairman Mao. No matter how difficult and tortuous the road of revolutionary struggle may be, the African people will, under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, after a long struggle, achieve victory and drive out all imperialists and colonialists from Africa.

    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下非洲革命人民反帝武装斗争深入发展
    武装斗争是被压迫人民解放的唯一道路
    非洲一些地区的爱国武装力量从战争学习战争愈战愈强
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：非洲人民的反帝武装斗争正在进一步深入发展。随着当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想在非洲的传播，越来越多的非洲被压迫民族的人民认识到毛泽东思想是他们争取真正独立的最强大的武器，武装斗争是他们取得解放的唯一道路。他们正在通过自己的斗争实践，总结经验教训，并且开始在战斗中学习运用毛主席的军事思想。
    在刚果（金）、莫三鼻给、安哥拉、“葡属”几内亚等地，反帝武装斗争坚持时间较久，有的已建立了农村根据地，有的正在积极开辟农村根据地。这些国家的游击战士们一直在同殖民军和傀儡军进行着“围剿”和“反围剿”的激烈斗争。在实际斗争中，他们对于毛主席的军事思想感到特别亲切。
    刚果（金）的许多游击战士说，毛主席的一些著作就好象是为刚果（金）人民的斗争而写出来的。刚果（金）的战士们学习了毛主席关于“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争”的光辉论断后，开始注意发动广大群众参加和支持武装斗争。刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会在它出版的刊物《游击战士》上发表文章指出，从过去的斗争中首先要汲取的经验和教训是，必须充分地发动和组织人民。文章说：“只有把人民发动和组织起来，才能改变敌我力量的对比。我们必须把发动和组织人民的力量看作是我们取得胜利的根本保证。”刚果（金）爱国武装的一些领导人，根据毛主席指出的战胜敌人的三件主要武器的教导，提出了创建一个革命政党，一个由这样的党领导的军队，以及由这样的党领导的统一战线的问题。
    莫三鼻给革命委员会在学习了毛主席为中国人民解放军制订的“三大纪律八项注意”后，颁布了关于加强组织纪律性的命令，其中包括：“一切行动服从命令”，“一切缴获归军队”，“讨论和解决问题时说话要和气”，“借物要归还原主”等。
    安哥拉的游击战士通过学习毛主席著作，结合安哥拉具体情况，分析了敌人和自己的各种有利和不利因素，进一步认清形势，决心对葡萄牙殖民主义者展开持久战，并在持久战过程中，积蓄力量，打败敌人。
    通过在实际斗争中学习毛主席的光辉著作，非洲反帝武装斗争的许多战士进一步认识到谁是革命的敌人，谁是革命的朋友，认识到毛泽东思想是反帝和反修的最锐利的武器。他们用毛泽东思想的显微镜看清了苏修领导集团在武装斗争问题上所玩弄的种种阴谋。有的自由战士一针见血地指出：苏修集团现在继续用“和平共处”、“通过和平谈判取得独立”、“通过联合国取得独立”等毒药来麻醉非洲被压迫人民，与此同时，为了掩盖其叛徒面目，他们也假装支持非洲人民的武装斗争；实际上，苏修集团只是把所谓支持武装斗争当作它同帝国主义妥协谈判、葬送人民革命事业的一种手段。
    非洲一些地区的爱国武装力量从战争学习战争，愈战愈强。许多游击战士现在都能背诵毛主席提出的游击战争十六字诀：“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追。”并且在实践中开始运用。这样，他们的战斗经验更丰富了，他们的战术更灵活了。他们经常伏击敌人的巡逻队和车队，突袭敌人的营地和据点，消灭敌人有生力量。
    在新点燃起武装斗争烈火的国家里，非洲人民也不断取得新胜利。在白人殖民政权残暴统治下的津巴布韦，非洲游击战士从去年四月以来，已经打死打伤数以百计的殖民军。白人殖民政权承认，今年八月以来，殖民军同游击队进行了“最激烈的战斗”。在西南非洲，自由战士从去年八月以来，积极活动，打死南非殖民军数十名。
    全世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”觉醒了的广大非洲革命人民正在按照毛主席指引的唯一正确的道路奋勇前进。不管革命斗争的道路上有什么艰难曲折，非洲人民必将在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，经过长期斗争，夺取胜利，把一切帝国主义者和殖民主义者赶出非洲。（附图片）
