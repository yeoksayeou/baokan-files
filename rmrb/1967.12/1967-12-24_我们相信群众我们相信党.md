We believe in the masses, we believe in the Party
Political Instructor of the Second Platoon of the 230th Ship, Liu Weidong

The Chinese Khrushchev attempts to sow discord between the Party and the masses, falsely claiming: "If the masses do not accept the policies and decisions, ... one can only wait, ... if they still do not accept, there is no other way, the mother wants to get married, the sky wants to rain, nothing can be done." Pfft! This is a slander against the Communist Party of China and a most shameless defamation of the broad revolutionary masses!

Chairman Mao pointed out: "We must believe in the masses, we must believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles. If one doubts these two principles, then nothing can be accomplished." The various policies formulated by the Party Central Committee, led by our great leader Chairman Mao, come from the masses and represent the greatest interests of the vast majority of the masses; they are a concentrated expression of the will and aspirations of the masses. The broad laboring people have unlimited trust in the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao. Once the policies formulated by the Party are presented to the masses, they are immediately and resolutely supported and enthusiastically endorsed by the masses. There is absolutely no such situation as the "mother wants to get married, the sky wants to rain, nothing can be done" that the Chinese Khrushchev slanders. For some policies, the masses may not understand them immediately, but as long as good propaganda and explanation work is done, the masses will quickly become enlightened.

In September of this year, I led the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to a village with a very complex situation to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. After entering the village, the class enemies created numerous difficulties for the propaganda team, attempting to drive us out of the village. However, we believed that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line would definitely be understood by the masses, and the masses would definitely support Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We believed that difficulties could only deter cowards, not the revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought; the more the masses are deceived, the more important and urgent it is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and the more the Communist Party members must step forward, take the lead, and set an example. I and the comrades of the propaganda team worked together, fearlessly facing attacks, daring to take risks, confronting difficulties, and actively carrying out mass work. By helping the masses with haircuts, chopping firewood, fertilizing, and treating illnesses, we did everything possible to approach the masses and have heart-to-heart talks with them, propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

An old woman believed the rumors of the bad elements and had great misunderstandings about us, her attitude was not normal. We followed Chairman Mao's latest instructions, propagated Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the old woman, told her about the great situation of the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, exposed the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the local ghosts and snakes, and expressed our firm belief and reliance on the poor and lower-middle peasants. From then on, the old woman became very affectionate towards us, saying she would no longer believe in rumors, firmly believe in the PLA, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and follow Chairman Mao! In this way, our propaganda work, overcoming all difficulties, was carried out. Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line quickly penetrated the hearts of the people. The deceived masses opened their eyes, exposed the enemy's tricks, and actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." The village took on a new look.

Ironclad facts are the most powerful refutation of the Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacy of "the masses not accepting policies." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao dearly and support the policies formulated by the Party. They know best that Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Every policy and regulation of the Party represents the greatest interests of the broadest masses of the people; they believe in Mao Zedong Thought the most, are most willing to accept Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and most firmly support the Party's policies. The Chinese Khrushchev attempts to sabotage the relationship between the Party and the masses, but this will never succeed.

    我们相信群众我们相信党
    二三○舰一队政治指导员  刘卫东
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄图挑拨党和群众的关系，胡说什么：“假如群众不接受政策、决定，……只得等待，……还不接受，也没办法，娘要嫁人，天要下雨，毫无办法。”呸！这是对中国共产党的污蔑，也是对广大革命群众最无耻的诽谤！
    毛主席指出：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”以我们伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央制定的各项政策，是从群众中来的，是符合最大多数群众的最大利益的，是集中地代表了群众的意志和愿望的；广大劳动人民，对以毛主席为首的党中央是无限信任的，党所制定的政策，一旦和群众见面，总是立即得到群众的坚决拥护和充分支持。根本不存在中国赫鲁晓夫所污蔑的“娘要嫁人，天要下雨，毫无办法”那种情况。有些政策群众一时不理解，但只要做好宣传解释工作，群众也就会很快觉悟。
    今年九月，我给毛泽东思想宣传队引路，到一个情况很复杂的村庄去宣传毛泽东思想。进村以后，阶级敌人给宣传队制造重重困难，妄图把我们赶出村庄。但是，我们相信毛主席的革命路线一定能够为群众所理解，群众一定会拥护毛主席的革命路线。我们认为，困难只能难住胆小鬼，难不住用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士；群众越是受蒙蔽，宣传毛泽东思想就越重要、越迫切，共产党员就越要挺身而出，当先锋，作模范。我和宣传队的同志一起，不怕围攻，敢担风险，迎着困难，积极开展群众工作。通过帮助群众理发、劈柴、积肥、看病，千方百计接近群众，和群众谈心，向群众宣传毛主席的最新指示。
    一位老大娘轻信坏人的谣言，对我们有很大的误解，态度不够正常。我们遵照毛主席的最新指示，给大娘宣传毛主席的革命路线，讲全国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫和当地牛鬼蛇神的罪行，表示坚决相信和依靠贫下中农。从此，老大娘对我们亲热极了，表示再不信谣言，坚信解放军，听毛主席的话，跟毛主席走！就这样，我们的宣传工作，排除万难开展起来了，毛泽东思想、毛主席革命路线很快深入人心，受蒙蔽的群众擦亮了眼睛，揭露敌人的诡计，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，村里出现了一派新气象。
    铁的事实是对中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“群众不接受政策”的反动谬论的最有力的痛斥。广大贫下中农无限热爱毛主席，拥护党制定的政策。他们最懂得，毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线是贫下中农的命根子。党的每项政策，每个规定，都代表着最广大人民的最大利益；他们最信仰毛泽东思想，最容易接受毛主席的革命路线，最最拥护党的政策。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图破坏党和群众的关系，这永远办不到。
