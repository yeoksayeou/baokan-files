The army organized a class to study Chairman Mao's thoughts, with both officers and soldiers participating. At first, I thought, "I'll have to be the teacher again," believing that I had more experience, more education, and more expertise than the soldiers. I thought that studying together meant I would be guiding the soldiers. However, when I arrived at the class, it was announced that a soldier from my platoon, Huang Yongshan, would be the class leader and that we would form a "red pair." Although I didn't say it out loud, I thought to myself, "Can a soldier lead an officer in studying?"

However, the facts taught me a lesson and gave me a vivid class on the mass line.

During a discussion on the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, some comrades only understood it from the documents, without connecting it to reality or their own thoughts, and the study was not effective. After discovering this problem, Huang Yongshan felt that this approach was not working. He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that study should combine theory with practice. Comrade Lin also instructs us that studying Chairman Mao's works should be active and practical, combining study with use. We must do this in our study class and establish a good revolutionary study style." Huang Yongshan organized everyone to share their experiences of combining study with practice, to brainstorm ideas, and to learn from other classes. After that, the study class focused on Chairman Mao's teaching that "the important sign of a great situation is that the people have been fully mobilized," linking it with personal observations and experiences, discussing the great situation, finding the root of one's own misunderstandings about the situation, breaking down selfishness, and establishing public spirit, promoting the revolutionization of thought. This way of studying, everyone inspired and educated each other, the masses educated themselves, and everyone had a deeper understanding of the great situation of the Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, raising everyone's awareness of the struggle between the two lines.

Reflecting on these events, I studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "one should not always think one is right, as if truth is always in one's hands. One should not always think that only one is capable, and others are not, as if the world would not turn without one." I felt it was very close to my heart and made me truly realize that "the masses are the true heroes." "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." We must seriously follow the mass line, respectfully learn from the soldiers, and continuously draw nourishment from the masses to promote the revolutionization of our thoughts.

    群众是真正的英雄
    广州部队某部排长　洪德州
    部队举办毛泽东思想学习班，干部和战士一起学习。开始，我脑子里冒出了“又要当先生”的想法，认为自己比战士资格老，受教育多，经验丰富，同战士一起学习，是叫我们去辅导战士。到了学习班，却指定我排战士黄用善同志当学习班的班长，并和我结成“一对红”。我口里没有说，心里却想，战士能领导干部把学习班搞好吗？可是事实教育了我，使我上了一堂最生动的群众路线教育课。
    学习班在讨论无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势时，有的同志只是从文件上来理解，不结合实际，不联系思想，学习效果不好。黄用善同志发现这个问题以后，感到这样学不行。他说，毛主席教导我们，学习要理论联系实际。林副主席也指示我们，学习毛主席著作要活学活用，学用结合。我们在学习班学习，一定要这样做，树立一种革命的好学风。黄用善同志组织大家交流活学活用的体会，让大家出主意，想办法，并到其他班去取经。以后，学习班便围绕毛主席关于“形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了”的教导，联系个人所见所闻的亲身感受，大谈形势大好的表现，找自己对形势看不清的思想根子，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，促进思想革命化。这样学习，大家互相启发，互相教育，群众自己教育自己，对无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势看得更清楚了，对毛主席革命路线的理解更深了，提高了大家路线斗争的觉悟。
    联系这些事情，我学习了毛主席关于“不要总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里。不要总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了”的教导，感到十分亲切，使我真正认识到：“群众是真正的英雄”。“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”我们只有认真地走群众路线，恭恭敬敬地向战士学习，不断地从群众中吸取营养，才能促进思想革命化。
