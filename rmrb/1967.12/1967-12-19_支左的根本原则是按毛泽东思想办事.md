From the radio, we heard the introduction of the advanced experience of the Beijing Knitting Factory and the 8341st Unit supporting the left. It felt very familiar and gave us great encouragement. The Beijing Knitting Factory is indeed a model for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and great strategic deployment. The 8341st Unit is indeed a red flag for supporting the left. The three principles of the 8341st Unit for supporting the left have highly and profoundly summarized the experience of supporting the left work, serving as the action guideline for the supporting left units. By comparing our own experiences, we deeply felt that if we adhere to these three principles, the supporting left work will be successful, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will move forward.

In the early days of our entry into the factory, we did not clearly establish the idea of being a student, and we did not regard doing painstaking, detailed, and in-depth ideological work as the primary issue. As a result, many problems arose in our work, creating a relatively difficult situation. Later, we followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, actively went among the masses to be students, and sought opinions. We conducted a serious study and analysis, compared with Chairman Mao's relevant statements, and conducted self-criticism. On this basis, we made three self-criticisms to the masses and corrected mistakes in practical work. The masses beat drums and gongs to welcome us, saying, "You are truly sent by Chairman Mao to make a revolution with us." For some of the deceived masses, we actively approached them, used our rest time to visit their homes, and had heart-to-heart talks with them. We patiently propagated Mao Zedong Thought to them, raising their class consciousness, and quickly aligning them with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. For the two opposing factions in the factory, we also firmly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, doing painstaking, detailed, and in-depth ideological work, and extensively conducting heart-to-heart talks. If one talk was not successful, we would have two or three talks. If it was not successful in a meeting, we would talk in the workshops or at home. Practice has proven that revolutionary masses listen to Chairman Mao the most. As long as we vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought and patiently do ideological work for them, any problem can be solved. Through our long-term work, the entire factory finally achieved revolutionary great unity and established the Revolutionary Committee on October 19.

In the future, we must learn well from the advanced experience of the 8341st Unit and the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing Knitting Factory, take them as examples, and resolutely implement the three principles of supporting the left. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment step by step to do the supporting left work better and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

　　支左的根本原则是按毛泽东思想办事
　　8157部队驻陕西毛纺厂毛泽东思想宣传队　王年松
    从广播里听到了北京针织总厂和驻厂支左的八三四一部队的先进经验介绍，感到非常亲切，受到莫大鼓舞。北京针织总厂不愧为贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和伟大战略部署的一个典范，八三四一部队不愧为支左的一面红旗。八三四一部队支左的三条原则，最高度、最深刻地概括了支左工作的经验，是支左部队的行动纲领。我们对照支左的亲身经历，深刻体会到，做到了这三条，支左工作就胜利，无产阶级文化大革命就向前发展。
    我们进厂初期，由于没有明确树立当小学生的思想，没有把做艰苦、细致、深入的思想政治工作当作首要问题来抓，工作中出现了不少问题，形成了比较困难的局面。后来，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，主动到群众中去当小学生，征求意见。我们认真作了研究分析，对照毛主席的有关论述进行检查。在提高认识的基础上，向群众作了三次自我批评，并在实际工作中改正了错误。群众敲锣打鼓，表示欢迎，说：“你们真是毛主席派来和我们一起闹革命的。”对于一部分受蒙蔽的群众，我们就主动同他们接近，利用休息时间，到他们家里去访问，同他们谈心。我们耐心地向他们宣传毛泽东思想，使他们提高了阶级觉悟，很快地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。对于厂里严重对立的两派组织，我们也是坚定不移地按照毛主席的教导，做艰苦、细致、深入的思想政治工作，广泛开展谈心活动。一次谈不好，就两次三次地谈。会上谈不好，就到车间、家庭里去谈。实践证明，革命群众最听毛主席的话。只要我们大力宣传毛泽东思想，耐心地向他们做思想政治工作，什么问题也能解决。经过我们长期工作，全厂终于实现了革命的大联合，并于十
  一月十九日成立了革命委员会。
    我们今后一定要很好地学习八三四一部队和北京针织总厂无产阶级革命派的先进经验，以他们为榜样，坚决贯彻执行支左的三条原则，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把支左工作搞得更好，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
