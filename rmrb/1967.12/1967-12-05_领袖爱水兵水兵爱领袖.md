What joy, comrades! We, two sailors from the 227th Ship who once had our photo taken with the great leader Chairman Mao, had the honor on December 3rd of seeing our dearest red sun once again in the magnificent Great Hall of the People. For over a decade, we have yearned day and night for our great leader Chairman Mao, and today, he once again took a photo with us. This is our greatest happiness, our greatest glory!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! On February 19, 1953, a radiant sun shone over the Wuhan Jianghan Pier, and you, dear leader, boarded the young warship of the People's Navy. The sky was filled with colorful clouds, and the warm spring breeze touched our hearts. Instantly, the entire ship was bathed in spring light, filled with warmth, and our hearts beat fiercely with joy. Faces turned towards the sun like sunflowers. The sailors, together with the great helmsman, began a great voyage.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The leader loves sailors, and sailors love the leader. During this great voyage, you, dear leader, spoke warmly with the sailors, caring for their growth like a loving father. You personally touched our naval uniforms, asking if we were cold; you went to the kitchen and picked up the ladle, asking if our food was delicious; you visited every station, even coming to our engine room. You taught us to love our ships, our islands, and our oceans, to stand guard over them. You posed for photos with the sailors three times on the front deck, making us remember this moment forever. Even now, we can clearly recall that on the morning of February 21st, under a clear blue sky and brilliant sunshine, from the engine room to the gun position, from the bridge to the forward cabin, the joyous news spread: "Chairman Mao will take a photo with us!" The rolling waves of the Yangtze River sang for us, and the towering mountains on both banks cheered for us. During the photo session, you, dear leader, asked the photographer if the comrades standing above could be seen clearly and if those in the back were clear. Your care for us was greater than that of our own parents. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your great and brilliant image will forever be the unsetting red sun in the hearts of the sailors. Your personal inscription, "To oppose imperialist aggression, we must definitely build a powerful navy," is our highest guideline for building the navy, shining brightly and guiding the growth of the People's Navy.

Over the past decade, whenever we recall this happy moment, we feel a surge of strength. Remembering your teachings, we remain vigilant and spirited, patrolling day and night along the coasts of our motherland, not allowing a single wolf to enter; remembering your teachings, we brave the storms and waves, navigating through the complex and intense class struggles without losing our way or changing our course, our red hearts forever turning towards the red sun; remembering your teachings, we trample the "self" underfoot and let "public" be our home, fearing no difficulties, daring to face any hardships.

Dear Chairman Mao! You, dear leader, always trust the masses, care for the masses, and are always heart to heart with the masses. Today, your sailors have come to your side once again. Gazing at your kind face, we do not blink, wanting to forever engrave your great image in our hearts. We will pass on your brilliant thoughts to future generations, spreading them across the four seas and five oceans, shining brightly for a thousand years and ten thousand years.

    领袖爱水兵水兵爱领袖
    二二七舰原水兵、海军某部  史文忠  孟振林
    幸福啊，同志！我们两个十四年前曾和伟大领袖毛主席合影的二二七舰的轮机兵，十二月三日，在宏伟的人民大会堂，又一次见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳。十多年来，我们日夜怀念的伟大领袖毛主席，今天又一次和我们一起合影了。这是我们最大的幸福、最大的光荣！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！一九五三年的二月十九日，一轮光辉灿烂的太阳，照耀武汉江汉关码头，您老人家登上了年轻的人民海军的战舰，万道彩霞空中映，阵阵春风暖人心。顿时，全舰春光明媚，热气腾腾，一颗颗红心剧烈地跳动，一张张笑脸象葵花朝太阳。水兵们和伟大舵手一起，开始了伟大的航程。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！领袖爱水兵，水兵爱领袖。在伟大的航程中，您老人家亲切地和水兵谈话，象慈父一般关心水兵的成长。您亲手摸着我们的水兵服，问我们冷不冷；您亲自到厨房拿起汤勺，问我们吃的香不香；您一个战位一个战位地看望，还亲自来到我们机舱。您教导我们要爱军舰、爱岛屿、爱海洋，叫我们站好这个岗。您在前甲板三次和水兵合影，更使我们终生难忘。直到现在我们还清晰地记得，二月二十一日，这个晴空万里，阳光灿烂的上午，从轮机舱到炮位上，从驾驶台到前大舱，到处都在传送着一个振奋人心的特大喜讯：“毛主席要和我们一起照相！”长江两岸巍峨起伏的群山在为我们欢呼，滚滚东流的江水在为我们歌唱。在照相的时候，您老人家问摄影师，站在上面的同志能不能照到啊？后面的同志清楚不清楚啊？您体贴我们胜过我们的亲爹娘。毛主席啊，毛主席！您的伟大光辉形象永远是水兵心中不落的红太阳。您的亲笔题词：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”这是我们建设海军的最高纲领，永远大放光芒，照耀着人民海军壮大成长。
    十多年来，每当我们回忆起这个幸福的时刻，就浑身都是力量。想到您老人家的教导，我们警惕高，斗志昂，日夜巡逻在祖国的海疆，不让闯进一个豺狼；想起您老人家的教导，我们迎着狂风斗，顶着恶浪上，在复杂激烈的阶级斗争中，不迷航，不转向，红心永远向着红太阳；想起您老人家的教导，我们把“私”字脚下踩，让“公”字把家当，什么困难都不怕，刀山火海也敢闯。
    敬爱的毛主席啊！您老人家最相信群众，最关心群众，永远和群众心连心。今天您的水兵又一次来到您的身旁，望着您老人家的慈祥面容，我们眼睛一刻也不离，一刻也不眨，要把您老人家的伟大的形象永远铭刻在自己心上，我们要把您的光辉思想传给子孙万代，传遍四海五洋，千年万载永放红光。
