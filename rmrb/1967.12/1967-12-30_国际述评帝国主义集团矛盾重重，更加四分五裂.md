In 1967, under the impact of the surging world people's revolutionary movement and the great upheaval, division, and reorganization of various political forces worldwide, the imperialist system accelerated its march towards comprehensive collapse, plunging deeper into political and economic crises. Within the imperialist bloc, the United States and Britain saw their power further eroded; while France and other Western European countries, though relatively stronger, also faced insurmountable difficulties. Contradictions among the imperialist countries in political, economic, and military aspects became increasingly sharp, and the struggle to shift burdens and vie for hegemony intensified. The imperialist bloc led by the United States became even more fragmented.

Throughout the year, major imperialist countries, particularly the United States and France, engaged in increasingly fierce open and covert struggles. As the great teacher Lenin pointed out, "...the strongest defenders of capitalist 'order' show that they are mutually undermining each other on every issue." In the Vietnam issue, the United States failed to gain the support of France and other major "allies," becoming increasingly isolated. France has long been dissatisfied with the United States replacing its position in Indochina. As the United States suffered more severe defeats in the Vietnam War, France intensified its attacks on the United States. To expand the Vietnam War, the United States has been seeking support from Western European countries. France not only ignored this but also refused to send representatives to the Southeast Asia Aggression Pact meeting to discuss the Vietnam War. Other Western European countries, except for Britain actively promoting the U.S. "peace talks" deception, also showed "coldness" towards the U.S. demands, unwilling to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for the United States. France also exploited the United States' predicament, demanding that U.S. troops in Vietnam "return home" while proposing the "neutralization of Southeast Asia" to attempt to restore French influence in Indochina.

In the Middle East issue, the United States and France also engaged in a tug-of-war. After the U.S. imperialism instigated Israel to launch an invasion of Arab countries, the Arab people rose up in anti-U.S. struggles. In this situation, France adopted a "neutral" stance, claiming to "oppose the Middle East war" and advocating a meeting of the "four major powers" (U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union) to discuss the Middle East situation, attempting to intervene. Britain and the United States, however, tried to exclude France, colluding with the Soviet revisionist bloc to jointly suppress the Arab people's anti-aggression struggles. During the spring session of the North Atlantic Council, the United States wanted Western European "allies" to support its neocolonialist plans for the Middle East, but France refused to "take a common stance" with the United States. Some small countries in Western Europe also expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' failure to consult with them during the Middle East crisis. Meanwhile, France took the opportunity to infiltrate the Middle East on a large scale, aiming to replace the positions of the United States and Britain.

On the so-called "non-proliferation" issue, the United States and France, along with other Western European countries, engaged in fierce control and counter-control struggles. The United States and the Soviet revisionists had been collaborating for years to concoct the so-called "non-proliferation treaty" to consolidate their nuclear monopoly. France openly criticized its purpose as establishing U.S.-Soviet hegemony. Italy and other Western European countries were also highly dissatisfied. Therefore, the United States and its Western European "allies" could not reach an agreement on the so-called "supervision clauses" of the "non-proliferation treaty." The U.S. and the Soviet Union had no choice but to leave the "supervision clauses" blank, presenting an incomplete "joint draft" to the United Nations General Assembly. This dashed the United States' hope of signing the treaty in 1967.

The North Atlantic Aggression Pact, used by the United States to control Western Europe, is rapidly disintegrating. After withdrawing from the military structure of this pact, France, in April, expelled the pact's headquarters and U.S. troops stationed in France. At the winter session of the pact's Council of Ministers, the United States attempted to use the intensification of U.S.-Soviet collusion as the center to adjust the pact's political and military strategies, continuing to maintain this pact as a tool for its counter-revolutionary global strategy. France, however, played counterpoint to the United States, not only refusing to participate in the military strategy discussions but also, on the eve of the meeting, proposing its own military strategy, opposing military "dependence on the United States." In political strategy, Western European countries emphasized that "individual policies need not be subject to collective decisions" in the context of intensifying collusion with the Soviet revisionist bloc and infiltration into Eastern Europe. They also agreed to "consult" on "intervening in crises and conflicts in external regions" but did not "assume obligations." The imperialist pact, which the U.S. imperialism had meticulously cultivated for over twenty years, is now in shambles, half-dead.

France not only vied for hegemony with the United States in Europe but also extended its reach into North America, which is within the U.S. sphere of influence. After visiting Latin America, the "backyard" of the United States, in 1964, De Gaulle visited Canada this year. In Canada, he strongly criticized U.S. control and aggression against Canada, advocating for French-speaking Canadians in Quebec to "take their own fate into their own hands" and repeatedly supporting Quebec's bid to become an independent sovereign state. This is a public challenge by France to U.S. hegemony in North America.

The struggle among imperialist countries for export markets and financial hegemony in the capitalist world reached an unprecedented white-hot level this year. The United States, Britain, West Germany, France, Japan, and other countries, while dumping goods abroad, also took protective tariff measures to prevent foreign goods from entering. France, West Germany, and other countries also exploited the growing international payment deficits and declining gold reserves of the United States and Britain, aiming to abolish the privileged positions of the dollar and pound in the capitalist world monetary system. The gold-buying frenzy triggered by the devaluation of the pound was a blow to the dollar and pound. All this indicates that imperialist countries are using every opportunity and means to engage in a life-and-death struggle.

The struggle among imperialist countries also manifested in Britain's application to join the European Economic Community (EEC) composed of France, West Germany, and other six countries. To ease its domestic fiscal and international payment crises, Britain, with the encouragement and support of the United States, repeatedly humbly applied to join the EEC. Britain's efforts once again encountered France's firm resistance. At the same time, the six EEC countries, due to their differing interests, also engaged in complex struggles over this issue.

The open and covert struggles, mutual sabotage among imperialist countries reached an unprecedented level of ferocity in the past year, unprecedented since World War II. The contradictions among imperialist countries, in essence, are struggles among imperialist countries for world markets, spheres of influence, and world hegemony. The sharpening of these contradictions is a necessary result of the intensification of the international class struggle in the era of imperialism's comprehensive collapse and socialism's global victory.

The flourishing world people's revolutionary struggles are an important cause of the intensification of imperialist contradictions. Post-war, the vigorous development of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America led to the collapse of the colonial system, making imperialist days increasingly difficult. Countries like Britain, with particularly strong parasitic characteristics, are in decline, becoming more and more obsolete. Over the past year, the great victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought have greatly promoted the awakening of oppressed peoples and nations worldwide, powerfully advancing the anti-imperialist struggles of revolutionary peoples worldwide, and placing imperialism and its lackeys in various countries in an even more difficult position. The new and old colonialist methods adopted by imperialism to maintain colonial rule and colonial interests have been resisted and opposed by revolutionary peoples everywhere. The imperialist bases for survival have further shrunk. This has led imperialist countries to engage in increasingly fierce struggles to seize the remaining bases. Their struggle to strangle each other to preserve themselves is a manifestation of the desperate struggle of dying imperialism under the powerful world revolutionary situation.

The law of uneven capitalist development determines the development of contradictions among imperialist countries. As U.S. imperialism becomes increasingly weak, its hegemonic position in the capitalist world is further shaken, making the struggles among imperialist countries more intense. The United States has always sought to control industrialized Western Europe, treating it as the center of its counter-revolutionary global strategy. Western European countries like France, however, strive to break free from U.S. control, competing with the United States for hegemony in Europe and further for world hegemony. Due to its failures in invading Vietnam and suppressing revolutionary struggles in various countries, the U.S. paper tiger's true nature has been thoroughly exposed. It not only faces worldwide condemnation and opposition politically but also, due to the massive consumption of war, its economic and military strength is increasingly weakened. This has led France and other relatively strengthened Western European countries to intensify their struggles against U.S. control of Western Europe and for hegemony with the United States. France aims to expel U.S. influence from Europe militarily and economically, establishing a "Europe of Europeans" led by France. France also seizes every opportunity to undermine the United States, attacking its hegemonic position. This will inevitably make the contradictions among imperialist countries, centered on U.S.-French contradictions, more complex and acute.

The impending new capitalist economic crisis has also deepened the contradictions among imperialist countries. Since the second half of last year, almost all imperialist countries have shown signs of economic crisis, such as stagnation or decline in industrial production, reduced exports, increased international payment deficits, rising domestic prices, and increased unemployment. The class contradictions within these countries have also become increasingly sharp. In this situation, monopoly capitalist groups in various countries, in addition to adopting measures such as freezing wages and increasing unemployment to intensify the exploitation of their own people, are vying to strengthen competition in the world market, attempting to collapse others and seize their territory to delay the outbreak of their own economic crises. Therefore, trade wars, tariff wars, and currency wars among imperialist countries have become increasingly fierce.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "The numerous and insurmountable contradictions within the imperialist system have plunged the imperialists into great anguish."

The irreconcilable contradictions among imperialist countries are one of the fundamental contradictions of the contemporary world, an important factor accelerating the comprehensive collapse of imperialism. As long as the revolutionary peoples of various countries strengthen their struggles against U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys in various countries, strengthen their struggles against old and new colonialism, and further shrink the imperialist bases of aggression, they will further deepen the contradictions among imperialist countries, hastening the demise of imperialism.

    国际述评帝国主义集团矛盾重重，更加四分五裂
    一九六七年，在风起云涌的世界人民革命运动的冲击之下，在世界各种政治力量大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面下，帝国主义制度加速走向全面崩溃，陷入更加深重的政治和经济危机。在帝国主义集团内部，美国和英国的力量进一步削弱；法国等西欧国家的实力虽则相对地增强，但也遇到不可克服的困难。各帝国主义国家之间在政治、经济和军事等各方面的矛盾日益尖锐，互相转嫁困难和争夺霸权的斗争大大加剧。以美国为首的帝国主义集团更加分崩离析。		（一）
    在这一年里，主要帝国主义国家之间，特别是美国和法国之间，进行了越来越激烈的明争和暗斗。事情正象伟大导师列宁所指出的：“……资本主义‘秩序’的最强有力的保卫者表明，他们在每个问题上都是互相拆台的。”　　在越南问题上，美国得不到法国等主要“盟国”的支持，越来越孤立。法国对美国取代它在印度支那的地位，一向强烈不满。随着美国在侵越战争中遭到日益严重的失败，法国对美国的攻击也加紧了。美国为了扩大侵越战争，一直在寻求西欧国家的支持，法国对此不但不加理睬，而且拒绝派代表出席讨论侵越战争的东南亚侵略集团的会议。其它西欧国家，除了英国积极为美国的“和谈”骗局奔走之外，也都怕惹火烧身，对美国的要求“表示冷淡”，不愿为美国火中取栗。法国还利用美国处境的困窘，一面要美国侵越军队“撤回本土”，一面又提出“东南亚中立化”的主张，企图借以使法国势力重返印度支那。
    在中东问题上，美国同法国也展开了勾心斗角的斗争。美帝国主义指使以色列发动侵略阿拉伯国家的战争以后，阿拉伯人民掀起了反美斗争的怒潮。在这种情况下，法国摆出一副“中立”的姿态，表示“反对中东战争”，鼓吹美、英、法、苏“四大国”开会商讨中东局势，企图插手进去。英、美则竭力撇开法国，勾结苏修集团来共同扼杀阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争。在北大西洋集团部长理事会春季会议期间，美国要西欧“盟国”支持它对中东地区的新殖民主义计划，但是法国拒绝同美国“采取共同立场”。西欧的一些小国也对美国“在中东危机期间没有同它们磋商”表示不满。同时，法国又趁机大规模地渗入中东地区，力图取代美、英的地位。
    在所谓“防止核扩散”问题上，美国同法国等西欧国家进行着激烈的控制和反控制的斗争。美国和苏修几年来一直在合伙炮制所谓“防止核扩散条约”，以巩固它们的核垄断地位。法国公开指责其目的不过是为了建立美苏霸权。意大利等其他一些西欧国家，也十分不满。因此，美国同它的西欧“盟国”之间，在“防止核扩散条约”的所谓“监督条款”的问题上，一直不能达成协议。美苏两家无可奈何，只好把“监督条款”空起来，拿出了一个残缺不全的所谓“联合草案”提到联合国大会上去。这就使得美国想在一九六七年签订这个条约的打算落了空。
    美国用来控制西欧的北大西洋侵略集团，正在加速瓦解。法国在退出这个集团的军事机构之后，又在今年四月把这个集团的总部和驻法美军赶出了法国。在这个集团的部长理事会冬季会议上，美国企图以加紧美苏勾结为中心，调整集团的政治和军事战略，继续维持这个集团作为它推行反革命全球战略的工具。法国却同美国唱对台戏，不但没有参加军事战略的讨论，而且在会议前夕抛出法国自己的军事战略，反对军事上“依附于美国”。在政治战略上，西欧国家在加紧同苏修集团勾结和向苏联东欧渗透的问题上，强调“各自的政策不必服从集体的决定”，并且在干预“外界地区发生的危机和冲突”的问题上只同意“进行磋商”，“而不承担义务”。美帝国主义苦心经营了二十多年的这个侵略集团，已经七零八落，半死不活了。
    法国不仅在欧洲同美国争霸，而且向属于美国势力范围的北美伸手。戴高乐在一九六四年访问美国“后院”拉丁美洲之后，又于今年访问加拿大。他在加拿大强烈指责美国对加拿大的控制和侵略，鼓吹魁北克地区法裔加拿大人“自己掌握自己的命运”，并且一再支持魁北克地区成为一个独立的主权国家。这是法国对美国在北美霸权的公开挑战。		（二）
    帝国主义国家为争夺资本主义世界的出口市场和金融霸权的斗争，一年来也达到了空前白热化的程度。美国、英国、西德、法国、日本等国都在一面向国外倾销商品，一面又竭力采取保护关税措施，防止外国商品侵入。法国、西德等国家还利用美、英两国国际收支亏空日益巨大，黄金储备不断减少，美元、英镑地位更加动摇等弱点，力图取消美元、英镑在资本主义世界货币体系中的特权地位。围绕英镑贬值引起的抢购黄金风潮，就是对美元、英镑的一次冲击。所有这一切表明，帝国主义国家之间，正在利用一切机会，使用一切手段，进行你死我活的火并。
    帝国主义之间的这种斗争，也表现在英国申请加入法国、西德等六国组成的西欧“共同市场”的问题上。英国为缓和国内财政和国际收支危机寻找出路，在美国鼓励和支持下，一再低声下气地申请参加西欧“共同市场”。英国的这些活动再次遇到了法国的坚决抵制。同时，西欧“共同市场”六国之间，由于各自利益不同，也围绕着这个问题展开错综复杂的斗争。		（三）
    帝国主义国家之间的明争暗斗，互相拆台，达到过去一年中这样激烈的程度，是二次大战以后没有过的。帝国主义之间的矛盾，从本质上来说，就是帝国主义国家争夺世界市场、势力范围、以及世界霸权的斗争。这种矛盾的日益尖锐，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代国际阶级斗争不断激化的必然结果。
    世界人民革命斗争的蓬勃发展，是促使帝国主义矛盾加剧的重要原因。战后由于亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，殖民主义制度的崩溃，帝国主义的日子已经越来越难过。象英国这样寄生性特别强的帝国主义国家，更是日暮途穷，一天天没落下去。一年多来，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利和毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，更是大大促进了全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的觉醒，有力地推进了世界革命人民的反帝斗争，使帝国主义及其在各国的走狗处于更加困难的境地。帝国主义为了保持殖民统治和殖民利益而采取的新老殖民主义的手段，到处都遭到革命人民的抵抗和反对。帝国主义赖以生存的侵略阵地更加缩小了。这就使得帝国主义国家之间为争夺残存的阵地，展开了越来越激烈的斗争。它们之间这种力图用掐死对方来保存自己的斗争，正是垂死的帝国主义在强大的世界革命形势下疯狂挣扎的一种表现。
    资本主义发展不平衡的规律，决定了帝国主义各国之间矛盾的发展。由于美帝国主义日益虚弱，它在资本主义世界中的霸主地位更进一步地动摇，这也就使帝国主义之间的争斗日趋激烈。美国一向力图控制工业发达的西欧，把西欧作为它反革命全球战略的重心。而法国等西欧国家则竭力要摆脱美国的控制，同美国争夺欧洲的霸权，并进而争夺世界的霸权。美国由于侵略越南和镇压世界各国人民革命斗争失败，纸老虎本质彻底暴露，不仅政治上遭到全世界的谴责和反对，而且经济上和军事上由于战争的大量消耗，力量越来越削弱。这就使得“实力”相对增强了的法国等西欧国家加紧进行反对美国控制西欧、同美国争夺霸权的斗争。法国力图从军事上、经济上把美国势力排挤出欧洲，建立一个法国领导下的“欧洲人的欧洲”。法国还利用各种机会，挖美国的墙脚，向美国的霸主地位进攻。这必然要使帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，以美法矛盾为中心，更加复杂化和尖锐化起来。
    新的资本主义经济危机的日益迫近，也加深了帝国主义之间的矛盾。从去年下半年以来，几乎所有帝国主义国家，都出现了工业生产停滞或下降，出口减少，国际收支逆差增加，国内物价上涨，失业激增等经济危机的迹象。这些国家国内的阶级矛盾也越来越尖锐。在这种情况下，各国垄断资本集团除了采取冻结工资，增加失业等办法来加紧剥削本国人民以外，竭力在世界市场上加强竞争，企图搞垮别人，夺取别人的地盘，来阻延本国经济危机的爆发。因此，帝国主义国家之间的贸易战、关税战、货币战越来越激烈。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出，“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”
    帝国主义之间不可调和的矛盾，是当代世界的基本矛盾之一，是加速帝国主义走向全面崩溃的一个重要因素。各国革命人民只要加强反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其在各国的走狗的斗争，加强反对新老殖民主义的斗争，更加缩小帝国主义侵略阵地，就将进一步加深帝国主义的矛盾，促使帝国主义的灭亡更早到来。
