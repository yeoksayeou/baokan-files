Workers and teachers in Dahomey have recently gone on strike and boycotted classes to resist the oppressive and exploitative policies of the reactionary government. Their struggle has forced the reactionary government to rescind its ban on strikes and union activities.

The current struggle, which began on December 8 with primary school teachers boycotting classes, quickly spread to secondary school teachers, postal workers, and employees in private enterprises. Due to the postal workers' strike, all telecommunications with the outside world were cut off, and operations at the largest airport in Dahomey, Cotonou, were also affected.

On December 9, Dahomey's President, Soglo, delivered a speech on television, declaring the strikes "illegal" and threatening to suppress "anarchy and chaos." Shortly after, more than ten union leaders were arrested.

On December 12, the General Union of Dahomey Workers issued an ultimatum to the reactionary government, warning that if the arrested union leaders were not released and the ban on strikes and union activities was not lifted, the union would call for a general strike.

Facing this immense pressure, the reactionary government hastily convened an emergency meeting and, by the evening, was forced to announce the withdrawal of the ban on strikes and union activities. However, the government refused to release the arrested union leaders, so the workers' struggle continues.

This massive strike and boycott is a response by the people of Dahomey to the reactionary regime of Soglo's oppressive and exploitative policies. After seizing power in a coup two years ago, Soglo has implemented anti-people policies, leading to severe economic difficulties, widespread unemployment, and a desperate situation for the people. To further exploit the people, the Soglo regime, after forcibly reducing the wages of public enterprise employees by 25%, recently ordered a "wage freeze" and imposed a so-called "national unity tax" of 25% on the wages of private enterprise employees. This has further provoked strong resistance from the people.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on December 15, workers in Dahomey launched a general strike on December 13 to resist the reactionary government's persecution and oppressive policies. The general strike paralyzed the largest city in Dahomey, Cotonou, and the capital, Porto-Novo.

That evening, the Chief of Staff of the reactionary government's army, Alley, openly threatened the union leaders, saying they "must not take any further strike actions." However, the workers of Dahomey, undeterred by the reactionary government's threats, continued their strike, fighting against the government's anti-people policies.

Due to the strike, the Cotonou International Airport has been closed for two days. On December 15, international scheduled flights from abroad were unable to land and had to be diverted to neighboring countries.

### 反抗反动当局的残酷剥削和压迫　达荷美爆发大规模罢工罢教斗争

　　反抗反动当局的残酷剥削和压迫
　　达荷美爆发大规模罢工罢教斗争
    据新华社十四日讯科托努消息：达荷美工人和教师最近举行罢工、罢教，反抗达荷美反动当局对他们加紧进行压迫和剥削。他们的斗争迫使反动当局取消了关于禁止罢工和工会活动的反动禁令。
    这次要求增加工资和反对征收所谓“全国团结税”的斗争，是从十二月八日小学教师罢教开始的，很快地就扩展到中学教师、邮电和私人企业部门的职工。由于邮电工人罢工，达荷美与外界的电讯联系全被切断，达荷美最大城市科托努的国际机场的工作也受到影响。
    达荷美反动当局的总统索格洛九日在电视台发表讲话，悍然宣布罢工“非法”，并威胁要对“无政府主义和混乱”进行镇压。随后有十多名工会领导人被捕。
    达荷美工人总联合会十二日向反动当局发出最后通牒，通牒中警告说，如果不释放被捕的工会领导人、不撤销禁止罢工和工会活动的禁令的话，工人总联合会将举行总罢工。
    面对这一强大压力，达荷美反动当局在当天匆匆召开紧急会议，并于当晚被迫宣布撤回关于禁止罢工和工会活动的禁令。但是，反动当局无理拒绝释放被逮捕的工会领导人，因此工人的斗争还在继续。
    这次大规模的罢工、罢教，是达荷美人民对索格洛反动政权的横征暴敛政策的一次反击。索格洛在两年前的一次政变中上台后，执行反人民的反动政策，国内经济困难，民不聊生，失业严重。为了进一步向人民搜刮，索格洛反动政权在把公用企业职工的工资强行降低百分之二十五之后，最近又下令“冻结工资”，并向私营企业职工强征占他们工资收入的百分之二十五的所谓“全国团结税”。这进一步激起了人民的强烈反抗。
    据新华社十五日讯  科托努消息：达荷美工人十三日发动总罢工，反抗达荷美反动当局的迫害和横征暴敛。总罢工使达荷美最大城市科托努和首都波多诺伏陷于瘫痪。
    在总罢工的当天晚上，达荷美反动政权的陆军参谋长阿莱竟明目张胆地威胁工会领导人“不得再采取罢工行动”。但是，达荷美的工人不顾反动当局的恫吓，继续坚持罢工，同反动当局的反人民政策进行斗争。
    由于罢工，科托努国际机场已经关闭了两天。十五日从国外来的国际航线定期班机无法着陆，被迫改道到邻国降落。
