Military and Civilians Jointly Establish Mao Zedong Thought Night School Study Class

This newspaper reports that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Air Force Unit 658 stationed in Xiangyang County, Hubei, have since last September, during the agricultural off-season evenings, jointly established a Mao Zedong Thought Night School Study Class with local commune poor and lower-middle peasants, grassroots cadres, and militia core members. They have been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, engaging in self-criticism and criticizing revisionism, and achieving good results.

Caring for National Affairs, Focusing on Revolutionary Criticism

The Mao Zedong Thought Night School Study Class follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, guiding soldiers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and grassroots cadres to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, care for national affairs, and actively participate in the Cultural Revolution.

To conduct a thorough criticism of the revolution, the study class sent members to investigate among the masses. They visited old poor peasants who had suffered greatly in the old society, encouraging them to use their personal experiences to refute the fallacies of China's Khrushchev about "exploitation being beneficial." They investigated the situation in production teams most severely affected by China's Khrushchev's "three selfs and one package" evil winds, organizing grassroots cadres to denounce and condemn China's Khrushchev's sinister plot to restore capitalism. They mobilized youth and soldiers to criticize the harm caused by "Cultivation" to the younger generation. The study class also held three criticism meetings with over three thousand poor and lower-middle peasants, fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. Subsequently, each brigade and production team organized criticism meetings to further eliminate the poisonous influence of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist thoughts.

The revolutionary criticism further deepened the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and soldiers' boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to Chairman Mao. The enthusiasm and self-awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works among the students reached an unprecedented level, creating a new atmosphere of extensively studying, lecturing, and applying "Old Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations. They said, "The Mao Zedong Thought Night School Study Class must not be dispersed by thunder, it must be run forever, passed down from generation to generation, and turn the countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought university."

Treating "Old Three Articles" as a Motto for Study

The Mao Zedong Thought Night School Study Class, following Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to study "Old Three Articles" as a motto, learn and apply them, and promote ideological revolutionization, extensively studied "Old Three Articles," extensively criticized "Cultivation," extensively broke down the "self" character, and extensively established the "public" character. Every time a viewpoint from "Old Three Articles" or a policy related to the Cultural Revolution was discussed, they organized everyone to extensively study and apply it, seeing immediate results.

This summer, the entire commune completed the grain procurement task on time and reserved enough reserve grain. How to handle the remaining grain? After studying "Old Three Articles," the community members and cadres unanimously decided to sell all of it to the state. Now, among the poor and lower-middle peasants, the action of "devoting oneself to the public good" and taking on heavy responsibilities has become a common practice.

Military and Civilians Learning from Each Other, Strengthening Unity

The Mao Zedong Thought Night School Study Class strengthened military-civilian unity, deepened military-civilian relations, and accelerated the ideological revolutionization of military and civilians. Poor and lower-middle peasants directly learned from the People's Liberation Army's "Three-Eight Work Style" and many excellent qualities; the poor and lower-middle peasants' clear class sentiments also directly influenced the broad soldiers.

The People's Liberation Army Air Force Unit 658 stationed in Xiangyang and the local people jointly established a Mao Zedong Thought Night School Study Class, which has already held three sessions. Two communes surrounding the station also imitated and established fifteen schools. Over three thousand people participated in the classes, with over one thousand formal students. One hundred fifty-five core members have been trained to study Chairman Mao's works.

### 军民合办毛泽东思想夜校学习班

　　军民合办毛泽东思想夜校学习班
    本报讯　中国人民解放军空军六五八部队驻湖北襄阳县的指战员，从去年九月开始，利用农闲的晚上，同驻地人民公社的贫农下中农、基层干部、基干民兵合办毛泽东思想夜校学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，收到了好效果。
    关心国家大事，狠抓革命大批判
    毛泽东思想夜校学习班，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，引导战士、贫农下中农和基层干部活学活用毛主席著作，关心国家大事，积极地投入文化大革命。
    为了搞好革命的大批判，毛泽东思想夜校学习班的学员到群众中去调查。他们访问了在旧社会苦大仇深的老贫农，启发他们用亲身经历去驳斥中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的谬论；调查受中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”歪风影响最厉害的生产队的情况，组织基层干部控诉、声讨中国赫鲁晓夫企图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋；发动青年和战士批判《修养》对青年一代的毒害。学习班还和贫农下中农三千多人，召开了三次批判大会，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。接着，各大队、生产队都组织批判会，进一步肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义思想的流毒。
    革命大批判进一步加深了广大贫农下中农和解放军战士对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级感情。学员中学习毛主席著作的积极性和自觉性空前提高，出现了大学、大讲、大用“老三篇”和毛主席语录的新气象。他们说，毛泽东思想夜校学习班要雷打不散，要永远办下去，祖祖辈辈传下去，把农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学
    毛泽东思想夜校学习班按照林副主席关于要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，学了就要用，搞好思想革命化的指示，大学“老三篇”，大批《修养》，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。每讲“老三篇”里的一个观点或有关文化大革命的一个方针、一项政策，就组织大家大讲大用，立竿见影。
    今年夏季，全公社已经如数完成了粮食征购任务，留足了储备粮。剩下的粮食怎么处理？社员、干部学习了“老三篇”以后，一致决定全部卖给国家。现在，在贫农下中农中间，“一心为公”，争挑重担的行动，蔚然成风。
    军民互相学习，加强了团结
    毛泽东思想夜校学习班，加强了军民团结，密切了军民关系，加速了军民思想革命化。贫农下中农直接地学习了解放军的“三八作风”和许多优良品质；贫农下中农爱憎分明的阶级感情，也直接感染了广大战士。
    人民解放军空军六五八部队驻襄阳某部和驻地群众合办的毛泽东思想夜校学习班，已先后办了三期。驻地周围的两个公社，也仿照办了十五所。参加听课的群众达三千人，其中正式学员一千多人。现已培养出一百五十五名学习毛主席著作的骨干。
