Tianjin and Qingdao held grand celebrations to mark the 7th anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The Chinese people firmly support the Vietnamese people in their war against American aggression and for national salvation. A delegation from the people of South Vietnam was warmly welcomed at the event.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin: Over 2,400 revolutionary masses of Tianjin gathered on the afternoon of December 26 to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and to warmly welcome the delegation from the people of South Vietnam, which arrived in Tianjin that afternoon. After the meeting began, a telegram from our great leader Chairman Mao to President Nguyen Huu Tho was read. The director of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee, Xue Xuegang, spoke at the meeting. He enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in their war against American aggression and for national salvation, which greatly boosted the morale of the Vietnamese people and revolutionary people around the world, and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of U.S.-led imperialism, the modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership, and reactionaries worldwide, making a great contribution to the world revolutionary cause. He strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's attempt to bring the Vietnamese issue into the track of Sino-American cooperation, using the counter-revolutionary tactic of fake support and real betrayal, actively helping the U.S. imperialists to peddle the "peace talks" deception, and attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's war against American aggression and for national salvation. Xue Xuegang expressed his firm belief that the heroic Vietnamese people will surely defeat the American aggressors and complete the sacred mission of liberating the South, defending the North, and reunifying the country.

The delegation leader from the people of South Vietnam, Nguyen Xuan Long, spoke amidst enthusiastic applause. He introduced the great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in their war against American aggression and for national salvation. He said that on December 19, 1967, Chairman Mao's telegram to President Nguyen Huu Tho reaffirmed the Chinese people's sincere support for the people of South Vietnam in their war against American aggression and for national salvation. He also said that the delegation was honored to be received by the respected Chairman Mao, whose warm concern for the patriotic struggle of the people of South Vietnam deeply moved the delegation. The people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam express their heartfelt thanks to the respected Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the fraternal Chinese people. Nguyen Xuan Long, with great enthusiasm, shouted: Long live Chairman Mao forever!

Representatives from the Tianjin Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, higher education Red Guards, and middle school Red Guards also spoke at the meeting. Leaders of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee, responsible officials of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tianjin, and Ding Xilin, a director of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association who accompanied the delegation from the people of South Vietnam to visit Tianjin, attended the meeting.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: Over 2,000 revolutionary masses of Qingdao held a gathering on the afternoon of December 26 to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and to warmly welcome the delegation from the people of South Vietnam.

The delegation from the people of South Vietnam, including Deputy Leader Le Thi Chi, Sam Luc, and other members, and Deputy Leader Nguyen Minh Phuong of the permanent representative office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, were invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting was held at the Qingdao People's Auditorium. Ji Mingling, a standing committee member of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. She said: The telegram from our great leader Chairman Mao to President Nguyen Huu Tho fully expresses the determination of 700 million Chinese people to firmly support the Vietnamese people in their war against American aggression and for national salvation. She enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in their war against American aggression and for national salvation. She strongly condemned the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in expanding the war of aggression and the treacherous activities of the Soviet revisionist clique in colluding with U.S. imperialism to betray the Vietnamese people.
