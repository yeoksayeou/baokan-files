The Mao Zedong Thought study class at the Beijing Dyeing Factory, with the focus on criticizing and repudiating revisionism, has implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have overcome factionalism, strengthened the party spirit, and turned opposition into unity. The students have actively sought out those with whom they had strong opposing sentiments and had heart-to-heart talks, making sincere self-criticisms. This has effectively consolidated the revolutionary great alliance and achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the working class has even less reason to split into two irreconcilable factions.

Mao Zedong

Editor's Note: After the revolutionary factions of the proletariat unite under revolutionary principles, they must vigorously criticize and repudiate all forms of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Only in this way can the organizational unity be consolidated after the union, and the unity be truly consolidated in thought.

The Mao Zedong Thought study class at the Beijing Dyeing Factory, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "guide the petty-bourgeois thinking in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution," has done solid ideological and political work. They have strengthened the proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, turned opposition into unity, consolidated the revolutionary great alliance, and achieved the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Their experience is good and can be referred to.

The Beijing Dyeing Factory has earnestly conducted the Mao Zedong Thought study class, actively guiding the leaders of the two revolutionary mass organizations to criticize and repudiate revisionism, sparking a revolution from the depths of their souls, and genuinely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions in practical actions. Through the study, the political and ideological awareness of the leaders of the two factions has significantly improved, overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthening the proletarian party spirit. As a result, opposition has turned into unity, effectively consolidating the revolutionary great alliance and achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

How to Make the Study Class Effective

How to make the Mao Zedong Thought study class effective immediately? Chairman Mao said, "In studying any process, if it is a complex process involving more than one contradiction, we must concentrate our efforts on finding its principal contradiction." The stationed military and the factory revolutionary committee preparatory group, following Chairman Mao's instruction to grasp the principal contradiction, analyzed the various contradictions in the factory. Everyone agreed that the revolutionary great alliance had been achieved by workshop, department, and team, and the situation was excellent. The current main task is to liberate cadres and promote the revolutionary three-in-one combination. To solve this problem, factionalism must be overcome, party spirit must be strengthened, and the leaders of the two factions must truly unite in thought, find common ground, and further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance. Although the original "East is Red" and "Revolutionary Alliance" factions had united organizationally under the revolutionary premise of a consistent direction of struggle, factionalism had not been completely overcome. Some did not trust each other and suspected each other. Some engaged in "intellectual battles," thinking of ways to trouble the other side. Some pushed difficult tasks to the other side, intending to make the other side lose credibility among the masses. Some competed for seats in the revolutionary committee. Especially on the issue of cadres, both sides were unwilling to liberate cadres who had once participated in the other side's organization.

Facing this situation, the factory revolutionary committee preparatory group decided to first invite the original leaders of the two factions to participate in the study class, while also inviting a portion of revolutionary cadres to participate, actively guiding everyone to criticize and repudiate revisionism.

Learning and Applying

How to overcome factionalism? One must expose factionalism and make sincere self-criticisms. However, some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations were unwilling to expose their personal issues; some were prepared to see how much "personal issues" the other side would expose before exposing their own. Some would expose their "personal issues" only after the other side had done so. Some only exposed trivial matters, not the key issues, to avoid giving the other side "straws." Some clearly knew in their hearts that they were wrong but did not admit it verbally. These ideological obstacles must be removed to make the study class effective in a short time.

The factory revolutionary committee preparatory group repeatedly guided the students to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect. First, they guided the students to raise their class consciousness and learn and apply Chairman Mao's works with class feelings. They organized "bitter and sweet remembrance meetings," inviting students with deep bitterness to reminisce about the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society; to reminisce about the bitterness of the bourgeois reactionary line and the sweetness of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. A student who had once been a coolie in Shanghai shared her past painful experiences and today's happy life with everyone. The students were deeply moved and further realized that they must closely follow Chairman Mao to carry the socialist revolution to the end. The factory revolutionary committee preparatory group also invited the stationed military to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, timely conveying Chairman Mao's various latest instructions to the students of the study class, enabling everyone to keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. At the same time, they also lectured to the students about the fundamental difference between public and private interests, making them realize that the "private" character is the root of all evil. Only by exposing one's "private" character and critically repudiating it can the root of factionalism be completely uprooted.

After raising their awareness, everyone could boldly expose their thoughts and inspect their factionalism. However, some people were satisfied with just exposing and did not truly solve the problem in thought. The military comrades discovered this situation, continued to help everyone actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect, further recognizing the harm of factionalism, and conducting analysis and criticism.

After a series of political and ideological education, everyone, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, made great resolutions, exposed their personal issues, dug out the roots of factionalism, and inspected the harm, further raising proletarian awareness. The students said, "The 'private' character was originally stinky, but we used to think it was fragrant. In the past, we only cared about the interests of our small group, which was the 'private' character and factionalism at work. We must completely uproot the 'private' character and overcome factionalism."

Setting an Example

To quickly eliminate mutual alienation, the students were no longer satisfied with individual self-criticism but actively sought out those with the strongest opposing sentiments for heart-to-heart talks. They called this practice "paired heart-to-heart talks." For example, the leaders of the revolutionary organization in the assembly workshop had been "enemies" with the original branch secretary of the workshop for over a year, with no words exchanged between them. During this heart-to-heart talk, both sides exposed all their wrong thoughts and made sincere self-criticisms, jointly denouncing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev for splitting them into "enemies."

After discovering this "paired heart-to-heart talk," the revolutionary committee preparatory group conducted a study, believing it to be a daring attack on the "private" character, achieving immediate results. They then helped both sides make deeper self-criticisms and organized them to share their experiences and feelings with all the students. After listening, the broad students were moved and said, "Even such 'enemies' can talk together, what can we not talk about!" They actively sought out those with strong opposing sentiments for heart-to-heart talks and made self-criticisms.

The revolutionary committee preparatory group also organized report meetings, inviting students who had good paired heart-to-heart talks to report to small groups, workshops, departments, and the entire factory. The "paired heart-to-heart talk" quickly spread. Past "enemies" became "in-laws." The students said, "This is Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought that brought us together." In this way, both the students' self-criticism and the masses' active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works were promoted, and unity was strengthened.

Preventing the Return of Factionalism

To consolidate the results of the study class and prevent the "private" character from "resurfacing," thoroughly overcoming factionalism, the revolutionary committee preparatory group gathered the students who had participated in the study class for a discussion every certain period, discussing how to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and the experiences of criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Everyone called this the "reforging meeting." A leader of the revolutionary mass organization in the maintenance department had performed well in the study class and had a relatively correct understanding of the significance of liberating cadres. However, after returning to the department, he was unwilling to specifically do it. In the "reforging meeting," he exposed his thoughts. After the help of comrades, he realized that this was the "private" character continuing to wreak havoc in his mind. The "private" character, once driven away, will come back. One must always be prepared to fight it and not let it return.

In addition, the factory revolutionary committee preparatory group also mobilized the students to go to the masses, accepting the masses' criticisms and supervision, preventing the return of factionalism.

Due to the persistent focus on "criticizing and repudiating revisionism," actively guiding the students to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and focusing on the "application" aspect, the Mao Zedong Thought study class in this factory achieved immediate results. The students said, "Through the study class, it feels like we have changed our minds, the 'private' character has been replaced with the 'public' character, factionalism has been replaced with party spirit, and 'opposition' has been transformed into 'unity.'" They said, "We are not two factions; everyone must be determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end as a proletarian revolutionary faction." (Accompanying photo)

　　北京印染厂毛泽东思想学习班以斗私批修为纲落实毛主席最新指示
　　克服派性增强党性化对立为团结
    学员们主动找同自己对立情绪比较大的对方谈心，作认真的自我批评，有力地巩固了革命的大联合，并实现了革命的三结合
　　在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。
　　毛泽东
    编者按：无产阶级革命派，在革命的原则下联合起来以后，还必须狠抓“斗私，批修”，进一步克服形形色色的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。这样，才能在组织上实现联合后，从思想上真正的巩固联合。
    北京印染厂毛泽东思想学习班，按照毛主席“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的教导，做了扎扎实实的思想政治工作，增强了无产阶级党性，克服了资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，从对立转化成团结，巩固了革命大联合，实现了革命三结合。他们的经验是好的，可供参考。
    本报讯　北京印染厂认真办好毛泽东思想学习班，积极引导两派革命群众组织的负责人斗私批修，从灵魂深处爆发革命，切切实实地把毛主席的最新指示落实到实际行动中。通过学习，两派负责人的政治思想觉悟大大提高，克服了小资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性。结果，对立变成了团结，有力地巩固了革命的大联合，实现了革命的三结合。
    抓住矛盾
    如何使毛泽东思想学习班收到立竿见影的效果呢？毛主席说：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。”驻厂解放军和厂革筹小组根据毛主席抓主要矛盾的教导，分析了厂里各种矛盾。大家认为，按车间、科室、班组实现了革命大联合，形势大好。当前主要的任务，是解放干部，促进革命的三结合。要解决这个问题，必须克服派性，增强党性，使两派的各级组织的头头从思想上真正团结起来，取得共同语言，进一步巩固和发展革命大联合。原“东方红”和“革联”两派组织，虽然在斗争大方向一致的革命前提下，从组织上联合起来了，但双方的派性还没有彻底克服。有的互不信任，互相猜疑。有的相互“斗智”，想点子难人家。有的把难办的事推给对方做，想让对方在群众中失去威信。有的在革委会中争席位。特别在干部问题上，双方都不愿意解放曾经参加过对方组织的干部。
    针对这种情况，厂革筹小组决定首先吸收原来两派的头头参加学习班，同时吸收了一部分革命干部参加，积极引导大家斗私。
    学了就用
    怎样克服派性呢？必须把派性亮出来，多作自我批评。但是，有些革命群众组织的头头，却不愿亮私；有的准备看对方斗多少“私”，自己也斗多少。有的等对方斗“私”后，自己再斗。有的专亮鸡毛蒜皮小事，不亮关键问题，免得让对方捞到“稻草”。有的明明心里知道错了，可是嘴上不承认。必须扫除这些思想障碍，才能使学习班在较短的时间里，起到立竿见影的效果。
    厂革筹小组反复引导学员活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。首先，他们引导学员提高阶级觉悟，带着阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作。他们组织了“忆苦思甜会”，请苦大仇深的学员，忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜；忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，思毛主席革命路线的甜。有个学员过去在上海做过包身工，她就向大家讲了过去痛苦的经历和今天幸福的生活。学员很受感动，进一步认识到，必须紧紧跟着毛主席，才能把社会主义革命进行到底。厂革筹小组还请驻厂解放军宣传毛泽东思想，及时把毛主席的各项最新指示，原原本本地传达给学习班的学员，使大家能够紧紧跟上毛主席的伟大战略部署。同时，还向学员大讲特讲公和私的根本区别，使他们认识到，“私”字是万恶的根源。只有亮出自己的“私”字来，狠狠地斗，才能彻底刨掉派性的根子。
    大家认识提高了，能够大胆亮思想，检查自己的派性。但是，有的人只满足于亮出就算了，没有真正从思想上解决问题。解放军同志发现这种情况，继续帮助大家活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，进一步认清派性的危害，进行分析批判。
    经过这样一系列的政治思想教育，大家都带着无限热爱毛主席和无限热爱毛泽东思想的阶级感情，大下决心，大亮私心，大挖私根，大查危害，进一步提高了无产阶级觉悟。学员们说：“私字本来是臭的，可是过去却以为它是香的。过去我们只顾自己小团体的利益，就是‘私’字作怪，派性作怪，一定要彻底挖掉‘私’字，克服派性。”
    树立样板
    为了更快地消除相互之间的隔阂，学员们已不满足于个人的斗私，而且主动找对立情绪最大的同志谈心。他们把这种做法称为“对口谈心会”。如整装车间革命组织负责人，过去同车间原总支书记是“冤家”，对立情绪非常严重，一年多来，互相没有说过话。这次谈心时，双方把各种错误思想原原本本地亮了出来，诚恳地作了自我批评，一起声讨中国赫鲁晓夫把他们分成“冤家”的滔天罪行。
    革筹小组发现这种“对口谈心会”后，进行了研究，认为这是敢于向“私”字打进攻战，立竿见影的好办法。于是，就帮助他们双方更深刻地作自我批评，组织他们向全体学员介绍经验和体会。广大学员听了后，感动地说：“象这样的冤家对头，都能谈到一起了，我们还有什么不能谈的！”纷纷主动找与自己对立情绪严重的同志谈心，作自我批评。
    革筹小组还组织讲用会，让对口谈心好的学员，到小组、车间、科室、全厂去汇报。“对口谈心会”很快地推广开来。过去的“冤家”，现在变成了“亲家”。学员说：“这是毛主席、毛泽东思想把我们合了家。”这样，既促进了学员斗私，又推动了群众活学活用毛主席著作，加强了团结。
    不让派性回头
    为了巩固学习班所取得的成果，防止“私”字“返潮”，彻底克服派性，革筹小组每隔一段时间，就把参加过学习班的学员，召集在一起，座谈怎样活学活用毛主席著作，以及斗私批修的体会。大家称这为“回炉会”。原维修科革命群众组织的一位负责人，在学习班里表现较好，对解放干部的意义也有比较正确的认识。可是回到科室后，又不愿意具体去做。在“回炉会”上，他暴露了自己的思想。经过同志们帮助，他认识到这是自己头脑中“私”字继续作怪。“私”字斗走了，它还会回来，必须时时准备同它斗，不让它回头。
    此外，厂革筹小组还发动学员到群众中去，接受群众的批评与监督，防止派性回头。
    由于坚持以“斗私，批修”为纲，积极引导学员活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，这个厂的毛泽东思想学习班收到了立竿见影的效果。学员说：“通过学习班学习，好象换了个脑袋，‘私’字换上了‘公’字，派性换成了党性，‘对立’转化为‘团结’。”他们说：“我们不是两派，大家都要做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”（附图片）
