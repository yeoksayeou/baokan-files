Representatives from the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" from Jiangxi, who have come to Shanghai, have been reporting the heroic deeds of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, which shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, to the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and revolutionary students in Shanghai. This has greatly inspired Shanghai's military and civilian personnel to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Last night, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held a symposium. Representatives from factories, schools, stores, and revolutionary mass organizations gathered with the comrades from the Heroic Fourth Platoon to discuss their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and in criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, including Comrade Zhang Chunqiao and other leading members, attended the symposium. Comrade Zhang Chunqiao met with the comrades from the Heroic Fourth Platoon and had a cordial conversation with everyone.

Comrade Zhang Chunqiao said, "The representatives of the Heroic Fourth Platoon coming to Shanghai to report their heroic deeds is a great support and profound education for Shanghai's proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad revolutionary masses. The Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong are indeed excellent soldiers personally cultivated by our great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They are models for the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country. They have boundless love and loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao. They have sincere concern for the Red Guards and firm support for the revolutionary left. Their shining example will promote the work and struggle of the Shanghai people."

Representatives from Shanghai's factories, schools, and revolutionary mass organizations introduced their experiences and insights on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, deeply carrying out criticism and repudiation of revisionism, and promoting revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, using the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong as shining examples. They expressed their determination to be like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, to be consistent in words and deeds, and to genuinely achieve "I love what Chairman Mao loves, I support what Chairman Mao supports, I follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and I advance when Chairman Mao waves his hand."

The representatives of the Heroic Fourth Platoon introduced the precious experiences of the 601st Unit in supporting the left and loving the people. They attributed all their achievements to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to redouble their efforts in studying Chairman Mao's works, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and to contribute greater efforts to achieving new great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
