The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Wulian County, Shandong Province, are using Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolutionary great criticism. They are uniting all revolutionary forces to carry out a revolutionary great criticism with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link. They study one quotation from Chairman Mao, analyze one problem, criticize one fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminate one stream of poison, and establish one revolutionary viewpoint, thus creating a set of experiences.

	Using "Four Learnings and Four Carryings," to Mobilize the Broad Masses of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants to Participate in the Revolutionary Great Criticism

In the early stage of carrying out the revolutionary great criticism in the countryside of Wulian County, the masses had an insufficient understanding of the great significance of the revolutionary great criticism and did not clearly see the evil facts of the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside. The proletarian revolutionary forces, with the help of the People's Liberation Army 6037 Unit which is supporting the left, guided the broad masses of commune members to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to lead the revolutionary great criticism, and bringing four aspects of problems to study.

	First, with the problem of insufficient understanding of the great significance of the revolutionary great criticism, they studied Chairman Mao's series of theories, lines, policies, and principles on whether there is still a need for revolution under the condition of the dictatorship of the proletariat, whose command to overthrow, how to carry out the revolution, and how to prevent the restoration of capitalism. This enabled everyone to further realize that the main target of the revolution under the condition of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Without carrying out a thorough revolutionary great criticism to eliminate their poisonous influence, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be half-hearted. The members of Jijiaoguan Brigade, Jiehe Commune said: "The revolutionary great criticism is like chopping down a tree and uprooting its roots. If the roots are not uprooted, the tree will sprout again, and capitalism will be restored." Through such study, the masses gradually became mobilized.

	Second, with the problem of how to mobilize the masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, they studied Chairman Mao's expositions on the mass line and people's war. "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can the war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can the war be waged." "The main force that has been fighting hard in the countryside is the poor peasants." Chairman Mao's teachings greatly aroused the class feelings of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They thought about the past and looked at the present, recalling the history of their emancipation and the pictures of their happiness, feeling that the responsibility of the revolutionary great criticism fell on their shoulders. Some poor and lower-middle peasant members said: "If only a few people criticize, it will neither overthrow the enemy nor educate the broad masses. Everyone must participate together."

	Third, with the problem of how to distinguish between enemies and friends and grasp the direction of the struggle, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people. "In front of us, there are two kinds of social contradictions, namely, the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions among the people. These are two kinds of contradictions with completely different natures." "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the success of our cause." Chairman Mao's teachings enabled the proletarian revolutionary forces to realize that without uniting all forces that can be united and mobilizing the masses to wage a people's war, the revolutionary great criticism cannot be carried out well. They enlightened and educated the masses to concentrate their hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev, unite as one, and form a vast revolutionary army to charge onto the battlefield of the revolutionary great criticism.

	Fourth, with the problem of how to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit in the revolutionary great criticism, they studied the "Three Articles." Through the study, everyone realized that "selfishness" is the root of revisionism and the core of the bourgeois world outlook. The Chinese Khrushchev is the representative and defender of "selfishness." Only by thoroughly overcoming "selfishness" can the struggle against revisionism be carried out to the end, and the Chinese Khrushchev be thoroughly criticized. Everyone drew a common conclusion: "No matter how many times you grasp, if you do not grasp the revolutionary great criticism, you are grasping blindly; no matter how busy you are, if you do not grasp the revolutionary great criticism, you are busy blindly."

	Grasping Five Key Points to Criticize Through a Black Line

With the help of the People's Liberation Army 6037 Unit which is supporting the left, the proletarian revolutionary forces in Wulian County concentrated the opinions of the masses and believed that to carry out the revolutionary great criticism well, it is necessary to concentrate the target and hit the vital point. The specific measures are:

	(1) Using Chairman Mao's teachings on never forgetting class struggle, they fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "the extinction of class struggle" and "exploitation has merits," enabling the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to realize: forgetting class struggle is the greatest act of forgetting one's roots.

	(2) Using Chairman Mao's theories on the collectivization of agriculture and the good of people's communes, they fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," enabling the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to realize: it is necessary to firmly block this wrong path and follow the great leader Chairman Mao to walk the bright road of socialism.

	(3) Using Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the commander and the soul, and that political work is the lifeline of all economic work, they fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of "material incentive" and "work points in command," enabling the broad masses of commune members to realize the harm of "work points in command" and "material incentive."

	(4) Using Chairman Mao's teachings on "comprehensive planning and proper arrangement" and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," they fiercely criticized the revisionist black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong in the procurement and distribution of grain, enabling the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to strengthen their sense of the overall situation and correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual.

	(5) Using Comrade Lin Biao's teachings on "studying Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions," they fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shandong for opposing the study of Chairman Mao's works and opposing the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, enabling the broad masses to realize: "Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of us poor and lower-middle peasants." Thus, a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works was set off.

	Using "Three Hooks and One Comparison," to Combine the Revolutionary Great Criticism with the Reform of One's Own Thought and with the Struggle-Criticism-Transformation of One's Own Unit

To further carry out the revolutionary great criticism, the proletarian revolutionary forces in Wulian County, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, created the method of "three hooks and one comparison" to fiercely criticize the Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and eliminate the poison. Their measures are: (1) to hook up the revisionist statements of the Chinese Khrushchev with the actual class struggle in the local area, to see how he opposes Chairman Mao; (2) to hook up the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev with the words and deeds of the capitalist-roaders within the Party in the unit, to see how he implements the revisionist line of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party; (3) to hook up the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev with one's own past thoughts and understandings, to see how one was poisoned and harmed. Then, using Mao Zedong Thought as a political microscope and telescope for comparison, if it is "selfishness," fight it; if it is "revisionism," criticize it.

    五莲县广大贫农下中农用毛泽东思想统帅革命大批判
    同仇敌忾，猛批中国的赫鲁晓夫  狠斗私字，在灵魂深处爆发革命
    据新华社济南六日电　山东省五莲县广大贫下中农，以“斗私，批修”为纲，团结一切革命力量，开展革命的大批判。他们学习一条毛主席语录，分析一个问题，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的一个谬论，肃清一股流毒，树立一个革命观点，创造了一套经验。
        用“四学四带”，发动广大贫下中农参加革命大批判
    五莲县农村在开展革命大批判初期，群众对革命大批判的伟大意义认识不足，对中国的赫鲁晓夫在农村复辟资本主义的罪恶事实看不清楚。无产阶级革命派在支左的人民解放军六○三七部队的帮助下，引导广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅革命大批判，带着四个方面的问题去学习。
    一是带着对革命大批判的伟大意义认识不足的问题，学习毛主席关于在无产阶级专政的条件下还要不要革命，革谁的命，怎样革命，怎样防止资本主义复辟等一系列的理论、路线、方针、政策。使大家进一步认识到，无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。不搞好革命大批判，彻底肃清他们的流毒，文化大革命就会半途而废。街头公社季家官庄大队的社员说：“革命大批判就好比是砍树刨树根，刨不净树根，以后还会发芽，资本主义还会复辟。”经过这样学习，群众逐渐发动起来。
    二是带着怎样放手发动群众、特别是发动贫下中农群众的问题，学习毛主席关于群众路线和人民战争的论述。“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。”毛主席的教导，极大地激发了广大贫下中农的阶级感情。大家想想过去，看看现在，一部部翻身史，一幅幅幸福图，感到革命大批判的责任就落在自己的肩上。有的贫下中农社员说：“光少数人批判，既不能批倒敌人，又不能使广大群众受教育，必须大家一齐上。”
    三是带着怎样分清敌我友，掌握斗争大方向的问题，学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导。“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”毛主席的这些教导，使无产阶级革命派认识到，不团结一切可以团结的力量，发动群众打一场人民战争，革命大批判是搞不好的。他们启发和教育群众，把千仇万恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上，团结一致，同仇敌忾，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，杀上大批判的战场。
    四是带着如何在革命大批判中破私立公的问题，学习“老三篇”。经过学习，大家认识到“私”字是产生修正主义的根源，是资产阶级世界观的核心。中国赫鲁晓夫是“私”字的总代表和维护者。只有很好地斗掉了“私”字，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底，才能批臭中国赫鲁晓夫。大家得出共同的结论：“千抓万抓，不抓革命大批判是瞎抓；千忙万忙，不抓革命大批判是瞎忙”。
    抓住五个要点，批透一条黑线
    五莲县无产阶级革命派在支左的人民解放军六○三七部队的帮助下，集中群众的意见，认为要搞好革命大批判，必须集中目标，击中要害。具体做法是：
    （一）用毛主席关于千万不要忘记阶级斗争的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“剥削有功”论，使广大贫下中农认识到：忘记了阶级斗争，就是最大的忘本。
    （二）用毛主席关于农业集体化和人民公社好的理论，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的“三自一包”、“四大自由”，使广大贫下中农认识到：必须坚决堵死这条歪路，跟着伟大领袖毛主席走社会主义光明大道。
    （三）用毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂。“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”的谬论，使广大社员认识到“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”的害处。
    （四）用毛主席关于“统筹兼顾、适当安排”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东的代理人在粮食征购和分配方面的修正主义黑货，使广大贫下中农增强了全局观念，正确地处理国家、集体、个人三者的关系。
    （五）用林彪同志“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东的代理人反对学习毛主席著作，反对宣传毛泽东思想的罪行，使广大群众认识到：“毛泽东思想是咱们贫下中农的命根子。”从而掀起一个大学大用毛主席著作的高潮。
      用“三挂钩，一对照”，把革命的大批判和改造自己的思想结合起来，和本单位的斗批改结合起来
    为了进一步深入开展革命大批判，五莲县的无产阶级革命派同广大贫下中农一起创造出“三挂钩，一对照”的办法，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，狠挖修正主义的根子，肃清流毒。他们的做法是：（一）用中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义言论同本地区的阶级斗争实际挂钩，看他是怎样反对毛主席的；（二）用中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论同本单位党内走资派的言行挂钩，看他是怎样贯彻执行党内最大的走资派的修正主义路线的；（三）用中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论同自己过去的思想认识挂钩，看自己是怎样中毒、受害的。然后用毛泽东思想这个政治上的显微镜和望远镜一对照，是“私”就斗，是“修”就批。（附图片）
