The Support-Left Group of the PLA's 6408 Unit stationed in Anhui Province, high-holding the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" as the main task, mobilized the revolutionary masses of the cultural troupe to expose the harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism, fiercely struggle against "self," and firmly establish "public" spirit, further consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance within the cultural troupe.

The Support-Left Group started from ideological and political work, helping the two revolutionary mass organizations of the cultural troupe to achieve revolutionary great alliance. However, they found that the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions had not been completely eliminated, and the petty-bourgeois factionalism of a few masses still surfaced from time to time. The comrades of the Support-Left Group and the majority of the masses unanimously believed: the class enemies are terrified and hate the revolutionary great alliance to death and will definitely try every means to sabotage it. If the petty-bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks is not eradicated, it may be exploited by the class enemies. Therefore, it is necessary to expose and condemn petty-bourgeois factionalism, consolidate the revolutionary great alliance ideologically, and achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

How to expose and condemn petty-bourgeois factionalism? The comrades of the Support-Left Group carefully studied Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions, reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on ideological and political work, and recalled the political work experience of the People's Liberation Army. They deeply realized that in the past, our army defeated the enemy by following Chairman Mao's teachings, first arousing the deep hatred of the broad cadres and soldiers towards the enemy. Today, to eliminate petty-bourgeois factionalism and achieve ideological great alliance, we must also follow Chairman Mao's teachings, expose the harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism, and make the revolutionary masses deeply hate and despise it ideologically. The comrades of the Support-Left Group shared their thoughts with the revolutionary masses of the cultural troupe, which immediately received the approval of the revolutionary masses. They took "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" as the main task and launched a self-education activity to expose the harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism.

The process of exposing the harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism is a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, breaking away from self and establishing public spirit, and firmly establishing proletarian party spirit among the revolutionary masses. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon to mobilize the masses to expose and condemn petty-bourgeois factionalism, helping the masses to completely liberate themselves from factionalism. In the activity of exposing the harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism, the Support-Left Group first organized the revolutionary masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, study the brilliant "Three Articles," especially repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions." After thorough ideological mobilization, the Support-Left Group guided everyone to connect with reality and launched a campaign throughout the troupe to expose the harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism. The proletarian revolutionary faction, with a deep hatred and disgust for petty-bourgeois factionalism, listed seven major crimes against it: (1) Petty-bourgeois factionalism leads to not being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao. (2) Petty-bourgeois factionalism leads to confusing the contradictions between the enemy and us and those within the people, treating the enemy as a "comrade" and the comrade as an "enemy." (3) Petty-bourgeois factionalism is easily exploited by class enemies, allowing them to stir up trouble and fish in troubled waters. (4) Petty-bourgeois factionalism leads to not trusting the masses and not trusting comrades with differing views. (5) Petty-bourgeois factionalism leads to only wanting to overthrow others but not oneself, not wanting to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. (6) Petty-bourgeois factionalism leads to not being able to carry out the work of supporting the army and loving the people correctly, taking an incorrect attitude towards the PLA. (7) Petty-bourgeois factionalism leads to not being able to carry the revolution through to the end, wavering on the revolutionary path.

Through extensive exposure and listing, the proletarian revolutionary faction deeply understood the harm of petty-bourgeois factionalism, having an urgent demand to expose and condemn factionalism, break away from self, and establish public spirit. Everyone voluntarily studied the "Three Articles," fiercely struggled against "self," broke away from factionalism, and the revolutionary great alliance between the two factions was consolidated and developed ideologically. The broad revolutionary masses said, we will definitely resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, implement Chairman Mao's instructions without any reduction. We will strive to do the following: resolutely implement what Chairman Mao advocates; vigorously praise what Chairman Mao affirms; resolutely learn from what Chairman Mao praises; resolutely rectify what Chairman Mao criticizes. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

　　毛主席提倡的我们坚决照办
　　毛主席批评的我们坚决改正
　　驻安徽省文工团支左小组发动群众狠斗私字，大摆小资产阶级派性的危害
    新华社合肥十八日电　人民解放军六四○八部队驻安徽省文工团支左小组，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，发动文工团的革命群众大摆小资产阶级派性的危害，狠斗
  “私”字，大立“公”字，进一步巩固和发展了文工团的革命大联合。
    这个支左小组从思想政治工作入手，帮助文工团两派革命群众组织实现了革命大联合之后，发现两派的对立情绪并没有完全消除，少数群众的小资产阶级派性还不断流露出来。支左小组的同志和大多数群众一致认为：阶级敌人对革命的大联合怕得要死，恨得要命，必然要千方百计地来破坏革命的大联合，而革命队伍中的小资产阶级派性不根除，就有可能被阶级敌人利用。因此，必须把小资产阶级派性搞臭，从思想上巩固革命的大联合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    怎样才能把小资产阶级派性搞臭呢？支左小组的同志认真学习了毛主席一系列极为重要的最新指示，重温了毛主席关于思想政治工作的教导，回顾了人民解放军的政治工作经验，深刻地认识到，当年我军消灭敌人，是遵照毛主席的教导，首先激发广大指战员对敌人的刻骨仇恨；今天要消除小资产阶级派性，实现思想上的革命大联合，也必须遵照毛主席的教导，大摆小资产阶级派性的危害，让革命群众从思想上对小资产阶级派性深恶痛绝。支左小组的同志把自己的想法讲给文工团的革命群众听，立即得到革命群众的赞成，他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，开展了一个大摆小资产阶级派性危害的自我教育活动。
    摆小资产阶级派性危害的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，在革命群众中大立无产阶级党性的过程。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是发动群众搞臭小资产阶级派性，让群众自己从派性中彻底解放出来的最强大的思想武器。在摆小资产阶级派性危害的活动中，支左小组首先组织革命群众反复学习毛主席在无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，学习光辉的“老三篇”，特别是反复学习毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”经过充分的思想发动，支左小组引导大家联系实际，在全团掀起一个大摆小资产阶级派性危害的活动。无产阶级革命派带着对小资产阶级派性深恶痛绝的心情，给它列了七大罪状：（一）小资产阶级派性作怪，就不能做到无限忠于毛主席。（二）小资产阶级派性作怪，就会混淆敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，把敌人当“同志”，把同志当“敌人”。（三）小资产阶级派性作怪，最容易被阶级敌人利用，让他们乘机挑拨离间，混水摸鱼。（四）小资产阶级派性作怪，就会不相信群众，不相信和自己观点有分歧的同志。（五）小资产阶级派性作怪，就会只知道革别人的命，不愿革自己的命，不想搞本单位的斗批改。（六）小资产阶级派性作怪，就不能很好地开展拥军爱民的工作，对解放军采取不正确态度。（七）小资产阶级派性作怪，就不能将革命进行到底，在革命的道路上摇摆不定。
    通过大揭大摆，无产阶级革命派深刻地认识了小资产阶级派性的危害，对搞臭派性，破私立公，有了迫切要求。大家都自觉地学习“老三篇”，大斗“私”字，大破派性，两派的革命大联合从思想上得到了巩固和发展。广大革命群众说，我们一定坚决听毛主席的话，不折不扣地执行毛主席的指示。努力做到：毛主席提倡的我们坚决照办；毛主席肯定的我们大力歌颂；毛主席表扬的我们坚决去学；毛主席批评的我们坚决去改。我们一定紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，巩固和发展革命大联合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
