Turn the Party Branch into a Stronghold of Mao Zedong Thought

A certain transport boat squadron Party branch secretary, Ji Dehong

The Chinese Khrushchev attempted to turn our Party branches into nightclub-style clubs for the bourgeoisie. He rambled on about how "a Party branch meeting should be held once a month, and it can be lively, lasting an hour, with two hours of performances." He also rambled on about how "what is a personal interest? If the communal pot of food cannot be eaten, it is a personal interest issue," and the Party branch should "specifically study and solve" the problem of eating, otherwise "what is the Party branch for?" Nonsense!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles." We deeply feel that of all the important things, the most important is to arm the minds of Party members with Mao Zedong Thought. The most important task of the Party branch is to arm all Party members with Mao Zedong Thought, to cultivate them into new people who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to lead the broad masses of people forward together.

In recent years, we have followed the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin, and in the construction of the Party branch, we have first focused on the "six first things." These are:

The first thing to do at the start of work every day is to line up and sing "The East is Red," shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" to pay tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao, and read the highest directives.

The first thing to do in learning, working, training, and shift handover is to collectively recite the highest directives, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide our actions.

The first thing to report to the branch is to report on the study of Chairman Mao's works, placing the study of Chairman Mao's works in the leading position.

The first thing to do after setting sail is to study the highest directives with tasks and requirements, advancing bravely along the course indicated by Chairman Mao.

The first thing to do upon arrival at the destination is to study the highest directives with the problems encountered during the mission, overcoming difficulties, and strengthening resolve.

The first thing to do after completing the mission is to discuss the sweetness of studying Chairman Mao's works and the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, deepening class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

By focusing on the "six first things," Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line are truly imprinted in our minds, dissolved in our blood, and implemented in our actions.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when Chairman Mao issued the great call to "support the broad masses of the left," the Party branch dispatched some cadres to participate in supporting the left. At the critical moment when class enemies stirred up the wind of economism and disrupted production, the Party branch immediately organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production," actively helping revolutionary masses complete cargo loading and unloading tasks, and organizing everyone to denounce and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev together with the revolutionary masses. The Party branch always guided Party members in the furnace of class struggle to think about major issues, grasp major principles, break major selfishness, and establish great public spirit, determined to temper themselves into steadfast warriors loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

In recent years, because the Party branch has taken arming Party members with Mao Zedong Thought as the most important task, the role of the stronghold has been continuously strengthened. Our squadron has been rated as a four-good squadron for four consecutive years. In the past three years, many soldiers have joined the Party, and all soldiers have been rated as five-good soldiers. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, cadres and soldiers have taken a clear stand, firmly supporting the left, and have withstood severe tests. We deeply feel that as long as everyone has deeply rooted Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, they can stand firm in the face of great storms and waves, and forever advance victoriously along the course indicated by Chairman Mao!

The Chinese Khrushchev wants to turn the Party branch into a "club," which is to cancel the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, cancel the leadership role of the Party branch, and turn the Party branch into a tool for his restoration of capitalism. This is a pipe dream! We will definitely take "criticize revisionism and repudiate self" as the key link, highlight proletarian politics, and turn the Party branch into a stronghold of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 把党支部办成毛泽东思想的战斗堡垒

    把党支部办成毛泽东思想的战斗堡垒
    某运输艇中队党支部书记　季德宏
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把我们党的支部变成资产阶级夜总会式的俱乐部。他胡说什么：“一个月开一次支部大会，可以活泼一点，开一个钟头，演两个钟头戏”。又胡说什么：“什么叫切身利益呢？大锅饭吃不下去，就是切身利益问题”，党支部应该“专门研究与解决”吃饭问题，否则要“支部做什么”？呸！这完全是胡说八道！
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”我们深深体会到，千重要，万重要，用毛泽东思想武装党员的头脑最最重要。党支部最重大的任务，就是要用毛泽东思想武装全体党员，把党员培养成为忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的共产主义新人，带领广大群众一道前进。
    几年来，我们遵循林副主席的教导，在党支部的建设上，首先狠抓“六个第一件事”。这就是：
    每天工作开始的第一件事，是列队高唱《东方红》，高呼“毛主席万岁！”向伟大领袖毛主席致敬，朗读最高指示。
    学习、工作、操课、交接班的第一件事，是集体背诵最高指示，用毛泽东思想统帅我们的行动。
    向支部汇报的第一件事，是汇报学习毛主席著作，把毛主席著作学习放在领先地位。
    出航后的第一件事，是带着任务和要求学习最高指示，沿着毛主席指引的航向，奋勇前进。
    到达目的地的第一件事，是带着执行任务中的问题学习最高指示，克服困难，增强斗志；
    完成任务后的第一件事，是畅谈学习毛主席著作的甜头和毛泽东思想的无比威力，加深对毛主席和毛泽东思想的阶级感情。
    通过狠抓“六个第一件事”，真正把毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，当毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召时，党支部抽出一部分干部参加支左工作。在阶级敌人刮起经济主义妖风，破坏生产的关键时刻，党支部立即组织大家学习毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的指示，积极帮助革命群众完成物资装卸任务，并且组织大家和革命群众一起声讨批判中国赫鲁晓夫。党支部处处引导党员在阶级斗争的熔炉里，想大事，抓大节，破大私，立大公，决心锻炼成为无限忠于毛主席革命路线的坚强战士。
    几年来，由于党支部把用毛泽东思想武装党员作为最重大的任务，战斗堡垒作用不断增强。我们中队连续四年被评为四好中队。近三年来，有许多战士入了党，全部战士党员被评为五好战士。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，干部战士旗帜鲜明，坚决支持左派，经受了严峻的考验。我们深深体会到，人人头脑里深深扎下了毛泽东思想的根子，就能在大风大浪里过得硬，永远沿着毛主席指引的航向胜利前进！
    中国赫鲁晓夫要把党支部办成“俱乐部”，就是要取消毛泽东思想挂帅，取消党支部的领导作用，把党支部变成他复辟资本主义的工具。这是梦想！我们一定以“斗私，批修”为纲，突出无产阶级政治，把党支部办成毛泽东思想的坚强的战斗堡垒。
