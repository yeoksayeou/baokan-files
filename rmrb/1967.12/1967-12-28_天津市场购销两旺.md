Implementing Chairman Mao's Directive to "Develop the Economy and Ensure Supply"
Tianjin Market Sees Brisk Buying and Selling

From January to November, the sales revenue of daily-use industrial products exceeded the same period last year by 17%. The quantities of cotton, oilseeds, and hemp products and other agricultural sideline products transported from various places have also significantly surpassed previous years' levels.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 27 — The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses in Tianjin's commercial sector have, in their commercial work, earnestly implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to "develop the economy and ensure supply." They have achieved a situation where both buying and selling are brisk, and the market is in a very good condition.

Throughout this year, Tianjin's retail commercial sector has exceeded its sales targets month by month. From January to November, the sales revenue of daily-use industrial products has increased by 17% compared to the same period last year. With the bumper harvest in agriculture and the arrival of the peak season in rural markets, large quantities of agricultural sideline products used as industrial raw materials have been continuously transported to Tianjin. This year, the quantities of cotton, oilseeds, hemp products, and other agricultural sideline products transported to Tianjin from various places have significantly surpassed previous years' levels. Some varieties have already completed their annual procurement plans one or two months ahead of schedule. At the same time, Tianjin's commercial sector is working day and night to transport daily-use industrial products to the countryside to meet the needs of the rural market.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses in the commercial sector have deeply exposed and criticized the capitalist business policies, such as "profit-first" and "material incentives," promoted by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party on the commercial front. They have consciously implemented Chairman Mao's overall policy for economic and financial work, "develop the economy and ensure supply." The business personnel in the commercial sector have actively and proactively reported market conditions and the opinions and demands of the broad masses regarding the variety and types of commodities to relevant factories, ensuring that the products produced by the factories can meet market needs.

The business leadership groups of various bureaus and companies in the city's commercial sector have adhered to the mass line in their work, consulted with the masses on matters, and sought advice from the masses when encountering problems. For a period this year, large quantities of live pigs were transported to Tianjin from various places, sometimes as many as over 30,000 pigs per day. The business leadership group members of the Municipal Food Bureau and the Food Company, along with the masses, arranged the forces and stood guard at the cargo site day and night, promptly distributing and allocating the pigs, with the result that not a single pig died.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses in the commercial sector have striven to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, significantly raising their ideological awareness and bravely shouldering the dual tasks of carrying out the revolution and promoting production. Many retail units' staff, although belonging to two major factions before achieving revolutionary unity, did not let differences in views affect their work. Everyone worked together to complete their tasks. Even during the most heated debates, the vast majority of salespersons remained at their posts, ensuring market supply.

    贯彻执行毛主席“发展经济，保障供给”的方针
    天津市场购销两旺
    一到十一月的日用工业品销货金额比去年同期增长百分之十七。各地运来的棉花、油料、麻类等农副产品数量也大大超过历年水平。
    新华社天津二十七日电　天津市商业部门的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在商业工作中认真贯彻伟大领袖毛主席提出的“发展经济，保障供给”的方针，做到购销两旺，市场出现一片大好形势。
    今年以来，天津市零售商业月月超额完成销货计划，一月到十一月的日用工业品销货金额比去年同期增长了百分之十七。随着农业大丰收和农村市场旺季的到来，大批用作工业原料的农副产品源源运到天津。今年各地运来天津的棉花、油料、麻类等农副产品的数量，大大超过历年水平，有些品种已分别提前一、两个月完成全年的调入计划。与此同时，天津商业部门正昼夜不停地加紧调运日用工业品下乡，供应农村市场需要。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，天津商业部门的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，深入揭发、批判了党内最大的一小撮走资派在商业战线上所推行的“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”等资本主义经营方针，自觉地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“发展经济，保障供给”的经济工作和财政工作的总方针。商业部门的业务人员积极主动地向有关工厂反映市场情况和广大群众对商品花色品种的意见和要求，使工厂生产出来的产品能够适应市场需要。
    全市商业部门各局、各公司的业务领导小组成员，在工作中坚持群众路线，有事同群众商量，遇到问题向群众请教。今年有一段时间，各地大批活猪运到天津，有时一天到货三万多头。市副食品局和食品公司等有关单位的业务领导小组成员，和群众在一起，安排好力量，并且日夜坚守货场，及时分配、调拨，结果没有一头猪死亡。
    商业部门的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，努力活学活用毛主席著作，大大提高了思想觉悟，勇敢地挑起了抓革命、促生产两副重担。许多零售单位的职工在实现革命大联合以前，虽然分属于两大派群众组织，但是他们不因观点分歧而影响工作，大家齐心协力，做好工作。即使在争论最激烈的时候，广大售货员仍然坚守工作岗位，保证了市场供应。
