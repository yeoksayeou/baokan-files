The great leader Chairman Mao has instructed us: "The army should, in stages and in batches, conduct military training for colleges, middle schools, and upper-grade primary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, rectifying organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership bodies, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. First conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, we came to the First Middle School to conduct military and political training. I was assigned to the twelfth grade, class three. The first problem I encountered was fear: fear of not doing well, fear of committing political errors, fear that the Red Guards would not listen, and fear that the work would not proceed smoothly.

I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: "Reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning." "Revolutionary warfare is the people's business; it is often not a matter of learning first and then doing, but of doing and then learning. Doing is learning." The "Sixteen Points" also point out: "We must eliminate the character 'fear.'" Yet, I was afraid. Isn't this a clear violation of Chairman Mao's teachings? Fear is fear of revolution; the root of fear is selfishness. We should put "dare" first and change that weak and incompetent state. We should learn from heroes like Lei Feng, always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, eliminate selfishness, and completely and thoroughly serve the people. We should be like the people's "old yellow ox," firmly carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions. Thinking of these things, I gradually eliminated the fear.

The second problem was how to do a good job.

Military training involves many problems, but the most fundamental and most urgent is to highlight proletarian politics and vigorously promote the study of Chairman Mao's works to fundamentally raise the ideological consciousness of the revolutionary Red Guards. Specific measures are: (1) Help the platoon leaders and deputy leaders study Chairman Mao's works well. (2) Emphasize the practical application of Chairman Mao's works, making it the top priority, ensuring daily reading and daily application, unshakable. (3) Introduce comrades from our company who study Chairman Mao's works well and provide their experiences. (4) Help class organizations establish Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. (5) When answering questions, pay attention to acting according to Mao Zedong Thought.

After arriving at the twelfth grade, class three, I saw that the class's thoughts were somewhat chaotic, with people together but hearts apart. Some students only liked to "work hard" and did not want to sit down and study. In response to these problems, I organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Against Liberalism," and the "Three Articles," thoroughly eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, overcoming various non-proletarian thoughts, and firmly establishing Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary youngsters studied and reflected, checked their own shortcomings and mistakes, and launched a fierce attack on selfishness. Everyone unanimously declared: Chairman Mao is our highest red commander. We will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, seriously reform our thoughts, and become good students who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

There was a student who liked to read ancient books, was poor in political studies, and had poor organizational discipline. In response to this situation, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades must understand that ideological reform is a long-term, patient, and detailed task. It is not possible to change someone's ideological consciousness, which has been formed over decades of life, by giving a few lectures or holding a few meetings. To make someone accept, one can only persuade, not force." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, through a lot of detailed political and ideological work, using Mao Zedong Thought to help and educate him, he gradually changed.

Through this work, I deeply felt: Chairman Mao's thought has the greatest power; wherever it is applied, it brings fundamental changes.

The third problem was relying on the masses and believing in the masses.

Vice Chairman Lin repeatedly instructed us: to learn from the local areas. Revolutionary young people have the least conservative thoughts and are the vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have experienced storms and seen the world, and have established great merits for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The process of participating in military training is also a process of learning from them. With Mao Zedong Thought as the guide and class struggle as the main course, humbly learn from them, and be their little students.

Once, the entire school organized a political camping trip, and the team proposed to do it in the style of the army. At that time, I thought that students were not as good as our army in organization and could not do it too well. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on believing in the masses and relying on the masses, I thought: the revolutionary youngsters listen to Chairman Mao the most. As long as we grasp the practical application of Chairman Mao's works, we will definitely be able to complete this political camping trip well. During the march, I repeatedly conducted ideological mobilization, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works in connection with reality, achieving redness along the way and redness wherever we stayed. Cultural activities were well-organized. Upon arriving at the destination, we actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought, strictly followed the three main disciplines and eight points for attention, and were warmly welcomed by the masses. Some community members said: "This time the students are really good, like soldiers without uniforms." When we left, the poor and lower-middle peasants were reluctant to part, escorting us a long way. Practice has proven: believing in the masses and relying on the masses, everything can be accomplished, everything can be done well.

The fourth problem was leading by example.

Vice Chairman Lin said: leading by example is more important than verbal instruction. This means influencing and inspiring the masses with actual actions, setting a good example everywhere. Washing things for the students, tidying up the classroom in the morning, cleaning the indoor and outdoor hygiene, wiping the tables, scrubbing the toilets, fetching meals and water, caring for the masses' lives—these are what should be done, but the most important thing is to take the lead in practicing and applying Chairman Mao's works, take the lead in executing Chairman Mao's great instructions, and take the lead in reforming thoughts. I did this, and it had a great influence on the students.

Living with the revolutionary youngsters for less than a month, studying and reforming thoughts with them, the revolutionary youngsters helped me a lot. On the front line of class struggle, I deeply felt: (1) No matter what work is done, first of all, Chairman Mao's works must be seriously studied, and Mao Zedong Thought must be used to guide all actions. (2) To educate others, first of all, one must seriously and diligently reform oneself and regard oneself as the object of revolution. (3) If there are mistakes and shortcomings, one must actively listen to the masses' opinions and warmly welcome the masses' criticisms. Criticism is the greatest trust and the greatest care for us. We must persist in what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests. (4) Humble learning from the masses. The Red Guards are our teachers, and the masses are the real heroes.

I think that any achievements should first be attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, I will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary faction, and together with the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students, successfully complete the glorious and great task of military and political training.

    军训中活学活用毛主席著作的体会
    ——李文忠同志生前思想汇报提纲（第二部分）
    伟大领袖毛主席指示我们：“军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。先作试点，取得经验，逐步推广。”我们遵照毛主席的指示来到第一中学进行军政训练。我被分配到十二级三班，碰到的第一个问题是怕：怕搞不好，犯政治错误，怕红卫兵不听话，工作不好开展。
    我反复学习了毛主席的教导，毛主席说：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”“十六条”也指出：“要去掉‘怕’字。”可是，我偏偏怕，这不明明白白违背毛主席的教导吗？怕，就是怕革命；怕的根子就是私。应该“敢”字当头，改变那种软弱无能的状态。我们要向雷锋等英雄学习，时刻牢记毛主席的教导，去掉私心，完全彻底为人民，当一头人民的“老黄牛”，坚决按毛主席的指示办事。想到这些，我逐渐消除了怕字。
    碰到的第二个问题是，如何才能搞好工作？
    军训要解决的问题很多，最根本的，最需要的是突出无产阶级政治，狠抓毛主席著作的学习，从根本上提高红卫兵革命小将的思想觉悟。具体的做法是：（一）帮助正副排长学好毛主席著作。（二）抓活学活用毛主席著作，压倒一切，做到天天读，天天用，雷打不动。（三）介绍我们连队学习毛主席著作好的同志，给他们提供经验。（四）帮助班级组织成立毛泽东思想宣传队。（五）解答问题，要注意按毛泽东思想办事。
    我到了十二级三班以后，看到班内思想较为混乱，人在一起，心各一方，有些同学只喜欢“大干”，不愿坐下来学习。针对这些问题，我组织大家在一块反复学习了毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》和“老三篇”等光辉著作，狠狠地破私立公，克服各种非无产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想。革命小将们边学习边对照，检查了自己的缺点和错误，向“私”字开展了猛烈炮轰。大家一致表示：毛主席是我们最高的红司令，我们一定听毛主席他老人家的话，认真改造思想，做一个无限忠于毛主席的好学生。
    有一个学生，爱看古书，政治学习差，组织纪律性也差。针对这个情况，我学习了毛主席的教导：“我们的同志一定要懂得，思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，不能企图上几次课，开几次会，就把人家在几十年生活中间形成的思想意识改变过来。要人家服，只能说服，不能压服。”遵照毛主席的教导，经过许多细致的政治思想工作，用毛泽东思想帮助他、教育他，使他逐渐地转变了。
    通过这段工作，我深深体会到：毛主席思想威力最大，用到哪里哪里就起根本变化。
    第三个问题是，依靠群众，相信群众。
    林副主席一再指示我们：要向地方学习。革命的青少年，最少保守思想，是无产阶级文化大革命的闯将。他们经风雨，见世面，为无产阶级文化大革命建立了伟大的功勋。参加军训工作的过程，也是向他们学习的过程。以毛泽东思想为指针，以阶级斗争为主课，虚心向他们学习，当他们的小学生。
    一次，全校组织政治野营，团里提出要按照部队那样搞。当时我想，学生不如咱部队好组织，不可能搞得太好。学习了毛主席关于相信群众、依靠群众的教导，我想：革命小将最听毛主席的话，只要抓好活学活用毛主席著作，就一定能很好地完成这次政治野营任务。行军途中我反复进行了思想动员，组织大家联系实际学习毛主席著作，做到了走一路红一线，住一地红一片，文娱活动搞得很好。到了驻地，积极宣传毛泽东思想，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意，深受群众欢迎。有的社员说：“这次来的学生真好，象没有穿军装的解放军。”临走的时候，贫下中农恋恋不舍，一直送出我们老远老远。实践证明：相信群众，依靠群众，什么都能办成，什么都能做好。
    第四个问题是，身教重于言教。
    林副主席说：身教重于言教。这就是要以实际行动影响和带动广大群众，处处作好样子。为同学们洗洗东西，早晨起来整理教室，搞搞室内外卫生，擦擦桌子，刷刷厕所，打饭打水，关心群众生活，这些是应该的，但是最最重要的是要带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头执行毛主席的伟大指示，带头改造思想。我这样做了，对同学们影响很大。
    同革命小将生活了不到一个月，和他们一块活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想，革命小将给我的帮助极大。在阶级斗争的第一线上，我深深地感到：（一）不论做什么工作，首先要认真地学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来指导一切行动。（二）要教育别人，首先要认真地刻苦地改造自己，要把自己当作革命的对象。（三）有了错误缺点，要主动听取群众意见，热烈地欢迎群众批评。批评是对我们最大的信任，最大的爱护，要为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的。（四）虚心向群众学习。红卫兵小将是我们的老师，群众是真正的英雄。
    我想，有点成绩首先应归功于伟大领袖毛主席，归功于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。今后我一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，坚决地支持无产阶级革命派，和广大革命师生一道，胜利地完成军政训练这个光荣而伟大的任务。　（新华社）
