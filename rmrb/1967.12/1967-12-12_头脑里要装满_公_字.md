	The noble quality of serving the people wholeheartedly—how is it cultivated? Let's look at a story about Li Congquan:

	The Mind Must Be Filled with the Character "Public"

	Last year, before the year-end assessment, the Sixth Company was tasked with construction work. Just as the entire company was working diligently and the project was progressing smoothly, the weather turned unfavorable. Winter rain poured for two days and two nights, making the mountains slippery and the roads muddy. Supplies could not be transported up the mountain, and gravel could not be washed, seriously affecting the construction schedule. Deputy Squad Leader Li Congquan was extremely anxious. After the morning shift, he volunteered to stay behind to wash another load of gravel. In the early winter of the north, the cold wind was like a knife, and the cold water penetrated to the bone. The frail and weak Li Congquan first carried water from the mountain foot, bucket by bucket, to the washing pool on the mountain. Then he jumped into the water up to his knees and washed several cubic meters of gravel in one breath.

	The sun came out, and the weather became a bit warmer. The water was no longer so cold. Li Congquan looked at the pile of washed gravel in front of him and felt a sense of relief throughout his body. He thought: This will ensure that the class can work normally in the afternoon, and comrades will definitely be satisfied. He became more and more happy as he thought about it, just as he was about to leave, a thought suddenly flashed through his mind: Did I, in my haste to be praised, forget about the quality? Thinking this, he casually picked up a handful of gravel and saw that his hand was stained with fine yellow mud. His heart stirred: I have to wash it again! But it was already past noon, and he hadn't eaten, feeling weak all over; maybe I should wait until after lunch to come back and do it! Just as he was struggling internally, Chairman Mao's great teachings rang in his mind like an alarm: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it is working thoroughly for the interests of the people." To achieve "completely" and "thoroughly," one's mind must be filled with the character "public." Li Congquan, who always strictly demanded of himself, compared himself to Chairman Mao's teachings and felt very ashamed. He thought: Construction is the important task entrusted by Chairman Mao to "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," and it is a concrete manifestation of serving the people "completely" and "thoroughly." Thinking this, he forgot his fatigue and hunger, jumped into the water, and washed again until the gravel was completely clean before he was satisfied and returned to the company under the setting sun.

### 头脑里要装满“公”字

　　一心为人民的高贵品质是怎样来的？请看李从全的一个故事：
　　头脑里要装满“公”字
    去年年终总评前，六连担负施工任务。正当全连热气腾腾、工程顺利进展的时候，天不作美，冬雨蒙蒙，一连下了两天两夜，山滑路泞，水运不上山，石子洗不出来，严重影响了施工进度。副班长李从全心里焦急万分，早晨下班后，主动请求留下来再洗一班石子。北方的初冬，寒风似刀，冷水透骨。体弱力小的李从全，先从山下把水一担担挑到山上洗石池里，然后跳进没膝深的凉水中，一口气洗出好几立方石子。
    太阳出来了，天气稍微暖和些，水也不怎么冰脚了。李从全看着眼前洗好的一大堆石子，浑身感到一阵轻松。心想：这一下保证班里下午正常施工了，同志们一定会很满意。他越整越高兴，正想往回走的时候，忽然一个念头闪了上来：我是不是为了图快受表扬，忘了质量？想着，便顺手抓起一把石子，一看手上沾了些细黄泥，他心里翻腾起来：得重新洗！可是，天已过晌午，还没有吃饭，浑身无力；还是等吃完饭再回来干吧！正在内心斗争时刻，毛主席的伟大教导，象警钟一样在他脑海里响了起来：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”做到“完全”“彻底”，头脑里就得装满“公”字。一贯严格要求自己的李从全，对照毛主席的教导，感到十分惭愧。他想：施工是执行毛主席交给的“备战、备荒、为人民”的重大任务，也是“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的具体体现。想到这里，他忘记了疲劳和饥饿，跳进水里重新洗了起来，直到把石子全部洗得干干净净，才满意地踏着晚霞返回连队。
