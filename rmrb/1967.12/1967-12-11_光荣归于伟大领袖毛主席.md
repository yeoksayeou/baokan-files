After the heroic deeds of the Fourth Platoon spread, revolutionary masses sent dozens of large red flowers. The comrades of the Fourth Platoon thought, to whom should these red flowers be dedicated?

	Glory to the Great Leader Chairman Mao

	To study Chairman Mao's works, one must study with questions in mind, apply them actively, combine learning with practice, learn what is urgently needed first, and see immediate results. Focus on the "use" aspect.

	Lin Biao

	Entering the barracks of the heroic Fourth Platoon, the first thing you see is the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao. Under Mao's portrait is the "People's Charter" of the 601st Unit, and on both sides of Mao's portrait are the Fourth Platoon's four diamond-hard oaths: "Where Chairman Mao loves, I love; where Chairman Mao supports, I support; where Chairman Mao directs, I follow; where Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance."

	Even more striking are the dozens of vibrant red flowers clustered around Chairman Mao's portrait. The red flowers face the sun, casting a red glow throughout the room.

	Where did so many red flowers come from?

	After the heroic deeds of the Fourth Platoon and their representatives Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Diankui in supporting the left and serving the people became known, proletarian revolutionary factions and Red Guards from the Nanchang area flocked to the Fourth Platoon. They brought shining copies of Chairman Mao's works to the heroic soldiers, wishing their comrades to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and stride forward on the path of revolution. They also brought one red flower after another, presenting them to the heroic soldiers, hoping their comrades would carry the people's expectations and, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, achieve new victories for the people!

	The soldiers took the Chairman Mao's works and the vibrant red flowers with both hands. Several excited faces turned simultaneously towards the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, and several fiery hearts flew towards Chairman Mao:

	"Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Every step we take forward is guided by you! It is your brilliant thoughts that illuminate our path forward, and it is your brilliant thoughts that nurture our growth. That day, when we rescued the Red Guard youth, it was your teaching of 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people that gave us the boundless courage to fear neither rapids nor treacherous waters, nor mountains of knives and seas of fire!"

	Looking at Chairman Mao's portrait, the soldiers thought and thought, and a common wish burst forth from the hearts of the several people: "We cannot accept these flowers of honor. We have only done what people's soldiers should do, following Chairman Mao's teachings. All honor and glory belong to our great leader Chairman Mao. These flowers of honor should be dedicated to Chairman Mao!"

	Thus, one red flower after another was placed in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. The red flowers faced the red sun, and the red sun shone upon the red flowers. They symbolize the eternal loyalty of hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel to the great leader Chairman Mao; they symbolize that under the guidance of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary factions, Red Guard revolutionaries, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are rapidly growing and striding forward, seizing new and even greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    四排英雄事迹传开后，革命群众送来几十朵大红花。四排同志心里想，红花应该献给谁？
　　光荣归于伟大领袖毛主席
    学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
　　林彪
    走进英雄四排的宿舍，迎面就是我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像。毛主席像下是六○一一部队的“爱民公约”，毛主席像的两侧是英雄四排的四句金刚石般的誓言：毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。
    更加引人注目的，是那簇拥在毛主席像周围的几十朵鲜艳的大红花。红花向阳，映射得全屋红光闪闪。
    那来的这么多大红花呢？
    英雄四排和他们的代表李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎烈士支左爱民的英雄事迹传开后，南昌地区的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵革命小将，络绎不绝地来到四排。他们带来金光闪闪的毛主席著作，献给英雄的战士，愿自己的亲人更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命化的大道上阔步前进。他们还带来了一朵朵鲜红鲜红的光荣花，献给英雄的战士，愿自己的亲人带着人民的期望，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，为人民立新功！
    战士们双手接过毛主席著作和鲜红鲜红的光荣花，十几张激动的面孔，不约而同地朝向伟大领袖毛主席的画像，十几颗火热的红心飞向毛主席身旁：
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们每前进一步，都是您老人家指引的啊！是您的光辉思想照耀着我们前进的道路，是您的光辉思想哺育我们成长。那天抢救红卫兵小将，是您“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导，给了我们激流险滩无所惧、刀山火海也敢闯的无穷力量！
    战士们望着毛主席的画像，想着，想着，一个共同的心愿从十几个人的心底迸发出来：“这光荣花我们不能接受，我们仅仅是按照毛主席的教导，作了一点人民战士应该做的事情。一切荣誉，一切光荣归于我们的伟大领袖毛主席，这朵朵光荣花应该献给毛主席！”
    于是，一朵朵红艳艳的光荣花摆到了毛主席像前。红花向着红太阳，红太阳照耀着朵朵红花。它象征着亿万军民永远永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席；它象征着全国的无产阶级革命派、红卫兵革命小将和人民解放军的战士，在我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的教导下，正在迅速成长，大步向前，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的更加伟大的胜利。
