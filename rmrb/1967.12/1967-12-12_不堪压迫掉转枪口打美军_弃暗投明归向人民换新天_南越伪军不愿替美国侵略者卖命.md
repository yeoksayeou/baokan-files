Under the heavy blows of the armed forces of the people of South Vietnam, the morale of the South Vietnamese puppet soldiers is low, and more and more of them are turning their guns on American and puppet officers and defecting to the people.

According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, on the night of August 11th, when the people's armed forces attacked the enemy's La Vang base in Quang Tri Province, many puppet soldiers inside the enemy's nest turned their guns on the puppet commander and killed him, then surrendered to the people. On the same night, the puppet soldiers in Phu Tho District, Thua Thien Province, also set fire to two ammunition depots and killed several thugs. In particular, the puppet soldiers at the Phu Bai base in Thua Thien Province caused an explosion in the American nest in August, killing and wounding nearly 100 American soldiers, destroying many vehicles, several dozen tons of bombs and shells, and causing a fuel depot to catch fire and burn.

In the South Central region, from early August to September 5th, nearly 200 puppet soldiers defected to the people. The puppet paratroopers in the city of Tra Vinh, Ba Ria Province, could not bear the abuse of the American invaders, and on August 2nd, they fired more than ten bursts of machine gun fire at the American base, causing the American bandits to suffer losses. The next day, three puppet paratroopers in Tra Vinh City beat an American who was committing evil deeds, leaving him with a black eye. A company of puppet soldiers sent to the enemy stronghold at Ai Son recently killed an American "advisor" while on the march, and then 45 of them escaped.

In the South Central region, the military and people launched fierce attacks on the enemy along various transportation lines at the end of August and early September, striking fear into the enemy and making them restless. The American puppet group sent two battalions of the 7th Regiment to "sweep" and repair the roads. These puppet soldiers refused to carry out the orders and more than 100 of them escaped. More than 100 puppet soldiers also escaped from Cai Lay and Cai Be districts in My Tho Province. Some puppet soldiers at the Chen Guo military training camp in Sa Dec Province, in opposition to the abuse by American officers, stabbed an American captain to death with a knife on the night of September 1st.

　　南越伪军不愿替美国侵略者卖命
    据新华社河内电　在越南南方人民解放武装力量的沉重打击下，南越伪军士无斗志，越来越多的伪军还掉转枪口打死美伪军官，弃暗投明。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道，今年八月十一日夜间，当人民武装进攻广治省敌军拉汪基地时，在敌人巢穴中有许多伪军掉转枪口打死伪军指挥官，然后向人民投诚。同天夜间，承天省丰田县的伪军，也纵火烧毁军火库两座，打死恶棍多名。特别是承天省芙拜基地的伪军，八月间在美军巢穴里制造了一次爆炸事件，炸死炸伤美军近一百名，炸毁许多军车、几十吨炸弹和炮弹，使一座汽油库起火燃烧。
    南部东区的西宁省从八月初到九月五日，有近两百名伪军弃暗投明。巴地省头顿市的伪军伞兵，由于忍受不了美国侵略军的虐待，在八月二日用机枪向美军驻地打了十多排子弹，使美国强盗遭到损失。第二天，头顿市的三名伪军伞兵又把一名为非作歹的美国佬打得鼻青眼肿。被派往艾山敌军据点的一连伪军，不久前在行军时打死美国“顾问”，然后有四十五人趁机逃跑。
    南部中区的军民在八月底和九月初猛烈袭击各条交通线上的敌军，打得敌人惊恐万状，坐卧不安。美伪集团派出伪军第七团的两营士兵去“扫荡”和维修公路。这些伪军拒绝执行命令，并有一百多人逃跑。美萩省丐?和丐礼县也有一百多名伪军士兵逃跑。沙沥省陈国篡军事训练营的一些伪军为反对美国军官的虐待，在九月一日夜间用匕首刺死一名美军上尉。
