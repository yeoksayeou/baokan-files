The first resolution made by the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee after its establishment was to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and vow to turn Tianjin into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought. The first study session was on Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" and the "Three Articles." The first class on class education was a meal of bitter food. The first piece of work was the adoption of "Several Regulations on Achieving Revolutionization."

New China News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th. The first resolution, the first study session, the first class on class education, and the first piece of work undertaken by the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee after its establishment are all full of vigorous revolutionary spirit. They express the firm resolve of all members of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to take "fighting self and criticizing revisionism" as the main task, to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and to turn Tianjin into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

"Raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and vow to turn Tianjin into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought" was the first resolution passed at the first plenary meeting of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee. The Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee believes that after its establishment, there are thousands and tens of thousands of things to do, but the most important task is to take Comrade Lin Biao as an example, to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao; to take "fighting self and criticizing revisionism" as the main task, to further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes on a large scale, and with the greatest determination and the fastest speed, to vow to turn Tianjin into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought. The first resolution of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee points out that to establish a school of Mao Zedong Thought, one must take Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the fundamental basis, take "fighting self and criticizing revisionism" as the main task, learn from the People's Liberation Army, study and apply the "Three Articles" thoroughly, seriously transform one's worldview, promote the revolutionization of one's thoughts, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Every member of our ranks must have infinite love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After studying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, one must see immediate results and take decisive actions. One must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further consolidate and develop the great unity and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, carry out the great criticism more deeply, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of one's unit, carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shine on every inch of Tianjin's land.

The first study session of the members of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee was on Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" and the "Three Articles." The members studied these brilliant works of Chairman Mao word by word and sentence by sentence, and unanimously agreed that studying these works today is more significant and profound than any previous study. The members of the Revolutionary Committee must always maintain the revolutionary style of being modest, prudent, not arrogant, not impatient, and striving hard. They must take the "Three Articles" as their motto, constantly transform their worldview, always be diligent servants of the people, be alert to the attacks of the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, always maintain the character of the proletarian revolutionaries, never leave the masses, and be reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Eating bitter food was the first class on class education for all members of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee. On the day the Revolutionary Committee was established, all members had their first meal, which was steamed buns mixed with bran. This was a meal that reminded people to never forget the past and to always maintain the spirit of hard struggle. Among the members, the old Red Army soldiers, old workers, old poor peasants, and revolutionary leading cadres who had bitter and bloody family histories in the old society, after eating the bitter food, were even more indignant towards the old society. When they recounted their past hard-fought lives to everyone, everyone spontaneously raised their arms and shouted: "Never forget class bitterness, always remember blood debts!" "Always remember class struggle!" "Always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The young Red Guards who grew up under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, after eating the bitter food, all expressed their determination to make up for this class on class education, inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the proletariat. The first class on class education for the Municipal Revolutionary Committee made all members even more hateful towards the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Khrushchev in China and his agents in Tianjin—Wan Xiaotang and Zhang Huaisan, and even more loving towards our most red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. They said, "The bitter food is eaten in the mouth, but the anti-revisionism and prevention of revisionism are remembered in the heart; eating the bitter food, following Chairman Mao to do a lifetime of revolution, the red heart will never change."

The first piece of work after the establishment of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee was to study how the Revolutionary Committee could achieve revolutionization. After repeated discussions and studies, the members unanimously agreed that the members of the Revolutionary Committee must take "fighting self and criticizing revisionism" as the main task, take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all work. They adopted "Several Regulations on Achieving Revolutionization." The regulations pointed out that the members of the Revolutionary Committee must achieve eight "musts": They must put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work; they must establish the idea of believing in the masses and relying on the masses, and learn the working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses; they must seriously carry out the principle of democratic centralism of the Party; they must establish the style of self-criticism; they must take "fighting self and criticizing revisionism" as the main task, and strengthen the unity of old and new cadres on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought; they must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective productive labor; they must become models in propagating and carrying out the Party's policies and guidelines, maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm, carry forward the style of being decisive and efficient, strengthen investigations and research, and improve work efficiency; they must maintain the character of ordinary laborers.

　　活学活用“老三篇”，以斗私批修为纲，认真改造世界观
　　天津市革委会树立无产阶级革命新风气
    革委会诞生后做的第一个决议是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓把天津市办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校；第一次学习会学习了毛主席的《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》和“老三篇”；第一堂阶级教育课是吃忆苦饭；第一件工作是通过了“关于实现革命化的几项规定”
    新华社天津十二日电  天津市革命委员会诞生后所做的第一个决议，第一次学习，第一堂阶级教育课，第一件工作，充满了生气勃勃的革命精神，表达了天津市革命委员会的全体成员，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把文化大革命进行到底，把天津市办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校的坚强决心。
    “高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓把天津市办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校”，是天津市革命委员会第一次全体会议上所做的第一个决议。天津市革命委员会认为，革命委员会成立后，有千件事、万件事要做，头等大事就是要以林副主席为榜样，无限忠于毛主席；要以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻执行毛主席一系列最新指示，大办毛泽东思想学习班，用最大的决心，最快的速度，誓把天津市办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。天津市革命委员会所作的第一个决议指出，办毛泽东思想大学校，必须以毛主席的“五·七”指示为根本依据，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大学解放军，狠学狠用“老三篇”，认真改造世界观，促进人的思想革命化，大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，使我们队伍中的每一个人，都对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。学了毛主席著作，学了毛主席的最新指示，一定要立竿见影，要雷厉风行地见之于行动。要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，进一步巩固、发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想在天津市的每一寸土地上永放光芒。
    天津市革命委员会成员的第一次学习会，是学习毛主席的《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》和“老三篇”。委员们逐字逐句地学习毛主席的这些光辉著作，一致认为，今天学习这些著作，比以往任何一次学习的意义都更加重大，更加深刻。革命委员会的成员一定要永远保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁和艰苦奋斗的革命作风，以“老三篇”为座右铭，不断地改造自己的世界观，要永远勤勤恳恳地做人民的勤务员，要警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击，永远保持无产阶级革命派的本色，永远不脱离群众，做无产阶级革命事业的可靠的接班人。
    吃忆苦饭，是市革命委员会全体成员所上的第一堂阶级教育课。革命委员会诞生的当天，全体委员吃的第一顿饭是掺有谷糠的窝窝头。这是一顿激励人们永远不忘过去，永远保持艰苦奋斗作风的忆苦饭。委员当中那些在旧社会有着血泪斑斑的苦难家史的老红军、老工人、老贫农和革命领导干部，吃了忆苦饭，更加激起了对旧社会的愤恨。当他们向大家讲述过去艰苦战斗的生活时，大家情不自禁地振臂高呼：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！”、“念念不忘阶级斗争！”、“念念不忘无产阶级专政！”“我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”委员中那些在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下成长起来的红卫兵小将，吃了忆苦饭，纷纷表示要补上阶级教育这一课，继承和发扬无产阶级的革命传统。市革命委员会的第一堂阶级教育课，使全体委员更加憎恨中国赫鲁晓夫及其在天津的代理人——万晓塘、张淮三反革命修正主义集团，更加热爱我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。他们说，“忆苦饭吃在嘴里，反修防修记在心头；吃着忆苦饭，跟随毛主席干一辈子革命的红心永不变。”
    市革命委员会诞生后的第一件工作，就是研究革命委员会如何实现革命化的问题。委员们经过反复讨论、研究，一致认为，革命委员会的成员必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，带头活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导方针。他们通过了“关于实现革命化的几项规定”。规定中指出，革委会的成员要做到八个“必须”，即：必须把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位；必须树立相信群众、依靠群众的思想，学会从群众中来、到群众中去的工作方法；必须认真贯彻执行党的民主集中制；必须树立自我批评的作风；必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，在毛泽东思想的基础上加强新老干部的团结；必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度；必须成为宣传和贯彻执行党的方针政策的模范，保持旺盛的革命干劲，发扬雷厉风行的作风，加强调查研究，提高工作效率；必须保持普通劳动者的本色。
