Carry On the Revolutionary Aspirations of the Martyrs and Be Good Soldiers of Chairman Mao
The Brothers of Martyrs Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Tianqing Honorably Enlist
The Jiangxi Provincial Military Region Holds an Enlistment Ceremony and Approves Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Tianbing as Soldiers of the "Support the Left and Serve the People Model Platoon"

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 12 — The younger brother of the "Support the Left and Serve the People Model" martyr Li Wenzhong, Li Wenhong, the elder brother of martyr Li Congquan, Li Congwei, and the younger brother of martyr Chen Tianqing, Chen Tianbing, have been approved by the Jiangxi Provincial Military Region of the People's Liberation Army to honorably enlist and become soldiers of the "Support the Left and Serve the People Model Platoon." The enlistment ceremony was recently held in Nanchang City in a grand manner.

The enlistment ceremony began with the solemn song "The East Is Red." In front of the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Tianbing, together with the soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army participating in the enlistment ceremony, read aloud the words of Chairman Mao: "Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hoist high their banner and march forward on the path of their blood!"

Following this, the commander of the Jiangxi Provincial Military Region, Yang Dongliang, read the decision of the Jiangxi Provincial Military Region to approve Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Tianbing for enlistment. The decision hoped that the three comrades, Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Tianbing, would, like comrades Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Tianqing, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, consciously temper and transform themselves, continuously raise their class consciousness, and become true communists.

In accordance with the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the intimate comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, to distribute "Selected Readings from Chairman Mao's Works" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to every soldier in the army like distributing weapons, the political commissar of the Jiangxi Provincial Military Region, Cheng Shiqing, presented Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Tianbing with Chairman Mao's works, Chairman Mao's badges, and "Serve the People" badges. Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Tianbing, dressed in new military uniforms, received the red revolutionary books, and shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

After the responsible person of the 601st Unit, the old Red Army soldier Zhang Yuanhe, presented the guns to Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Tianbing, the responsible person of the 601st Unit, Xu Hongyun, on behalf of all the soldiers and officers, expressed warm congratulations and welcome to Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Tianbing for their honorable enlistment. He hoped that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry on the martyrs' will, grasp the guns used by the martyrs, and bravely march forward to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The good soldier of Chairman Mao, Nian Siyang, spoke on behalf of the advanced collectives and model heroes of the entire army present. He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things.' People listen to Chairman Mao's words, and the guns listen to people. Every revolutionary soldier must take loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line as the highest criterion for thought and action, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime, transform one's thoughts according to Chairman Mao's instructions for a lifetime, and do revolution for a lifetime."

The father of Chen Tianbing spoke on behalf of the relatives of the three new soldiers. He instructed the three new soldiers to carry on the class of Mao Zedong Thought, and like the comrades of the Fourth Platoon, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao closely, and be a communist who is forever loyal to Chairman Mao.

Amidst enthusiastic applause, Li Wenhong, Li Congwei, and Chen Tianbing walked onto the stage one by one, full of vigor, and expressed their determination to the great leader Chairman Mao. They said: Today, we have honorably enlisted. This is the greatest trust that Chairman Mao and the people of our country have placed in us, and it is also the greatest happiness and greatest glory of our lives. We are the children of poor and lower-middle peasants saved from the fire pit by Chairman Mao. We must carry on the revolutionary aspirations of the martyrs, take up the guns of the martyrs, and hold onto the power of the proletariat. We must take the revolutionary martyrs as our example, forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

　　继承先烈的革命大志　做毛主席的好战士
　　李文忠等三烈士的兄弟光荣入伍
　　江西省军区举行入伍式，批准李文红、李从卫、陈佃兵为“支左爱民模范排”战士
    新华社南昌十二日电　“支左爱民模范”李文忠烈士的弟弟李文红，以及李从全烈士的哥哥李从卫、陈佃奎烈士的弟弟陈佃兵，经中国人民解放军江西省军区批准，光荣入伍，成为“支左爱民模范排”的战士。入伍仪式最近在南昌市隆重举行。
    入伍仪式在庄严的《东方红》歌声中开始。在伟大统帅毛主席的巨幅画像面前，李文红、李从卫、陈佃兵同参加入伍仪式的人民解放军某部指战员一起，齐声朗读毛主席语录：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”
    接着，江西省军区司令员杨栋梁宣读了江西省军区关于批准李文红、李从卫、陈佃兵入伍的决定。决定希望李文红、李从卫、陈佃兵三同志，象李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎同志那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地锻炼、改造自己，不断提高阶级觉悟，做一个真正的共产主义战士。
    遵照毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席关于要象发武器一样把《毛泽东著作选读》和《毛主席语录》发给全军每个战士的指示，江西省军区政治委员程世清，向李文红、李从卫、陈佃兵颁发了毛主席著作和毛主席像章、“为人民服务”语录章。李文红、李从卫、陈佃兵穿上新军装，接过红彤彤的革命宝书，齐声高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    六○一一部队负责人、老红军战士张元和给李文红、李从卫、陈佃兵授枪以后，六○一一部队负责人许洪云代表全体指战员对李文红、李从卫、陈佃兵光荣入伍表示热烈的祝贺和欢迎，希望他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继承烈士遗志，握紧烈士用过的枪，为保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而奋勇前进。
    毛主席的好战士年四旺，代表到会的全军先进集体和英雄模范讲话，他说，毛主席教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”人听毛主席的话，枪就听人的话。我们每一个革命战士都要把忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线作为思想和行动的最高准则，读一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示改造一辈子思想，干一辈子革命。
    陈佃兵的父亲代表三个新战士的亲属讲话，他嘱咐三个新战士要接好毛泽东思想的班，和四排同志一样，活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席寸步不离，做一个永远忠于毛主席的共产主义战士。
    在一片热烈的掌声中，李文红、李从卫、陈佃兵英姿勃勃地相继走上主席台，向伟大领袖毛主席表示决心。他们说：今天，我们光荣入伍了。这是毛主席和祖国人民对我们最大的信任，也是我们一生的最大幸福和最大光荣。我们是毛主席从火坑里救出来的贫下中农的子弟，我们一定要继承先烈们的革命大志，接过烈士们的枪杆子，保住无产阶级的印把子。一定要以革命先烈为榜样，永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
