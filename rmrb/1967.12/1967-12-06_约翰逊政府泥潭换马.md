Just as American imperialism is mired in the quagmire of the Vietnam War, facing imminent disaster, Johnson recently announced the removal of Defense Secretary McNamara. This act of changing horses in the mud signifies that American imperialism in the Vietnam War has reached a dead end.

McNamara has served as the U.S. Secretary of Defense for nearly seven years, playing a crucial role in the American imperialist aggression against Vietnam. He is one of the major criminals in the U.S. ruling class who initiated such a large-scale war of aggression and has always been hailed by the U.S. ruling class as the "most outstanding," "most capable," and "most intelligent" "Secretary of War." Now, this once arrogant American war monger has finally been forced to resign under the heavy blows from the heroic Vietnamese people. Isn't this a clear indication that American imperialism's policy of aggression against Vietnam has suffered a humiliating failure?

Currently, the U.S. aggressors have deployed over 500,000 troops in South Vietnam. However, on the battlefield, they are increasingly in a passive position, taking blows. This year during the rainy season, over 60,000 U.S. troops in Vietnam were annihilated, more than double the number from the same period last year. Since the beginning of this dry season, the liberation forces in South Vietnam have taken the initiative to launch attacks in areas such as Loc Ninh, Phuoc Long, and Dinh Tuong, achieving several significant victories. In just over twenty days starting from late October, 14 battalions and 30 companies of U.S. and puppet forces were annihilated. In the skies over North Vietnam, over 2,600 U.S. aggressor aircraft have been shot down. The war expenses in Vietnam are continually rising, now reaching around $30 billion annually, significantly deepening the financial and economic difficulties of the United States. The anti-war movements among the American people are surging. Internal conflicts within the U.S. ruling class are further intensifying. The days of the Johnson administration are getting tougher.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, when discussing imperialism and reactionaries, pointed out: "They are so corrupt, so full of increasing internal disputes that cannot be resolved, so despised by the people and isolated, having suffered so many defeats, that they are inevitably heading towards destruction." The current situation of American imperialism in Vietnam is exactly like this.

The more severe the failure of American imperialism in the Vietnam War, the more intense the internal disputes within the U.S. ruling class. McNamara's removal is a reflection of the escalating contradictions within the American ruling class. As the U.S. presidential "election" approaches, Johnson, in order to cover up the responsibility for the failure of the Vietnam War, ease internal conflicts within the ruling class, and improve his position in next year's "election," has made McNamara a "scapegoat," staging a "muddy swap" performance.

Despite various internal conflicts within imperialism and reactionary forces, they are united in their attempts to suppress and eliminate revolutionary forces. Whether McNamara steps down or another Secretary of Defense takes over, American imperialism will not change its policy of aggression and war. In his announcement of McNamara's resignation, Johnson openly declared: "Our policy of participating in the Vietnam War is firmly decided." Recent war cries from U.S. military and political figures have been even more frenzied, even publicly stating the intention to expand the war into Cambodia and Laos. Clearly, American imperialism in the Vietnam War will intensify its military adventures, continuing down the path of escalating the war.

No matter what tricks the Johnson administration plays, no matter how high it escalates the war, or how it manipulates the dual tactics of war and "peace talks," the complete failure of American imperialism in the Vietnam War is inevitable. The final victory will undoubtedly belong to the great Vietnamese people who dare to struggle, dare to win, and are determined to fight the anti-American, national salvation war to the end!

    约翰逊政府泥潭换马
    本报评论员
    正当美帝国主义在侵越战争中泥足深陷、面临灭顶之灾的时候，约翰逊最近宣布撤掉麦克纳马拉国防部长的职务。这种在泥潭中换马的做法，标志着美帝国主义在侵越战争中已经陷入了穷途末路的地步。
    麦克纳马拉担任美国国防部长将近七年，在美帝国主义侵越战争中扮演了一个重要角色，是美国统治集团中发动这样一场大规模侵略战争的重要罪犯，一向被美国统治集团捧为“最出色”、“最能干”、“最聪明”的“战争部长”。现在，这样一个曾经耀武扬威的美国战争贩子，终于在英雄的越南人民的沉重打击下，被迫丢掉差使而黯然下台。这难道不是清楚地表明，美帝国主义侵越政策遭到可耻失败吗？
    目前，美国侵略者向南越投入的兵力已达五十万以上，可是在战场上，却越来越处于被动挨打的地位。今年雨季，侵越美军被歼六万多人，比去年同期被歼人数增加一倍以上。这一个旱季开始以来，南越解放武装力量又到处主动出击，在祿宁、福平和德都等地区连续打了几个漂亮的大胜仗。仅仅从十月底开始的二十多天中，美伪军被歼灭的就有十四个营和三十个连。在越南北方上空，被击落的美国强盗飞机，已经超过二千六百架。侵越战费不断激增，现在每年已达三百亿美元左右，大大加深了美国财政经济的困难。美国人民反对侵越战争的群众运动，更加高涨。美国统治集团内部的矛盾进一步加剧。约翰逊政府的日子越来越不好混了。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席在谈到帝国主义和反动派的时候，曾经指出：“他们是那样腐化，那样充满日益增多的无法解决的内部争吵，那样被人民唾弃而陷于完全的孤立，打了那样多的败仗，因此他们就必不可免地走向灭亡。”当前美帝国主义在越南的处境，也正是这样。
    美帝国主义在侵越战争中失败得越是惨重，美国统治集团内部也就争吵得越凶。麦克纳马拉的被撤职，就是美国统治集团内部矛盾激化的一个反映。由于美国总统的“大选”日益临近，约翰逊为了掩饰侵越战争失败的责任，缓和统治集团内部的矛盾，改善自己在明年“大选”中的地位，就把麦克纳马拉当作一只“替罪狼”，作了一场“泥潭换马”的表演。
    帝国主义和反动派内部尽管有这样那样的矛盾，但是，在力图镇压和消灭革命势力方面，却是一致的。无论是麦克纳马拉下台，还是另一个国防部长上台，美帝国主义绝不会改变它的侵略政策和战争政策。约翰逊在宣布麦克纳马拉下台的声明中就公开叫嚷：“我们参加越南战争的方针是坚决确定了的。”美国军政要员最近也连续发出疯狂的战争叫嚣，甚至公然表示要把战争扩大到柬埔寨和老挝。很明显，美帝国主义在侵越战争中将要加紧军事冒险，继续沿着扩大战争的道路走下去。
    约翰逊政府不管耍什么花招，不管把战争升到那一级，不管怎样玩弄战争与“和谈”的反革命两手，美帝国主义在侵越战争中的彻底失败是确定无疑的。最后胜利一定属于敢于斗争、敢于胜利，决心把抗美救国战争进行到底的伟大的越南人民！
