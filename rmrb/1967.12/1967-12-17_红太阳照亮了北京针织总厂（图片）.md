The red sun illuminates the Beijing Knitting Factory.
	Singing revolutionary songs, revolutionary fervor is high. Memorizing the "Three Articles," the spirit of public service is in our minds. The more we study, the more we feel our spirits soaring; the more we sing, the brighter our hearts become. The revolutionary masses of the Beijing Knitting Factory, with boundless admiration for Mao Zedong Thought, are deeply studying Chairman Mao's works, memorizing the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations, and are working hard on putting them into practice. They are breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit, transforming their worldviews. This is a scene of workers and leftist support personnel from the Clothing Workshop together memorizing the "Three Articles."

	Promoting Mao Zedong Thought, doing thorough, meticulous, and arduous ideological and political work is a fundamental principle that the 8341st Unit's leftist support personnel firmly grasp in their leftist support work. They not only do arduous, meticulous ideological work for the masses but also for the cadres, inspiring them to come forward voluntarily, taking "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, sparking a revolution in their souls, breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit. They help cadres who have made mistakes to correctly handle their relationships with the masses and with themselves, deeply examine their mistakes, and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	This is Comrade Gu Yuanxing (second from the right), the leader of the leftist support unit, studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with cadres from the Beijing Knitting Factory and discussing their study experiences.

	Thunderclaps open new realms, and east winds sweep away the remnants of the clouds. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, with the help of the leftist support personnel from the 8341st Unit, quickly achieved great unity and the three-in-one combination, and on November 11th established the factory revolutionary committee. All the revolutionary workers of the factory enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Comrade Lin Biao said: "Various study classes should be opened, by the center, by the localities, and by revolutionary mass organizations as well, turning the whole country into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought." The leftist support personnel from the 8341st Unit, following the instructions of Vice Commander Lin, opened various study classes. Now, more than one-third of the revolutionary workers and cadres in the factory have participated in the study classes. In the study classes, they take "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, discussing the great situation, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions, living a "united, tense, serious, and lively" Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style study life. Through study, they promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, achieve and consolidate the great unity and the three-in-one combination, and push forward the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units.

	This is a scene of comrades participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study class singing Mao Zedong quotations songs.

	The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory resolutely let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions. After achieving great unity, they have turned the shift handover books previously used by the two sides to attack each other into positions for promoting Mao Zedong Thought. They say: hand over quotations, care for each other, help each other. This is a scene of young female workers diligently copying Chairman Mao's quotations into the shift handover books after their night shifts.

	The Beijing Knitting Factory was originally an important stronghold of the old Beijing Municipal Committee in promoting the revisionist line in the textile system. Now, all the revolutionary workers in the factory are wielding the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, criticizing and denouncing, determined to completely overthrow and expose the stench of the revisionist line of running enterprises and the unreasonable regulations of the Chinese Khrushchev, clean up the garbage, eliminate the poison, and turn the factory into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	This is a scene of workers using their spare time to write big-character posters for criticism.

	Chairman Mao teaches us to "care for the people's livelihood." The leftist support personnel from the 8341st Unit often visit workers' families, bringing Chairman Mao's warm concern for the people and Mao Zedong Thought. The workers are deeply moved and say: Chairman Mao cares most about the people. We are determined to read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words for life, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions for life, and serve the people for life.

	This is a scene of medical personnel from the leftist support unit visiting workers' dormitories to treat workers.

	"To solve the problem of superior-subordinate relationships well, to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to visit, to see for themselves, to insist on the mass line, to consult with the masses on matters, and to be the students of the masses." The members of the Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions into action, establishing new cadre-mass relationships. They take "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, firmly grasp the transformation of worldviews; insist on the mass line, go among the masses to solicit opinions; insist on going down to the workshops to participate in labor, be the students of the masses, and be the servants of the people. This is Deputy Director Zhang Chengming (second from the right) chatting with worker comrades after cleaning the workshop.

	When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an endless force, becoming an invincible spiritual atomic bomb. Because the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, the entire factory presents a great situation, with the revolution booming and production flourishing. This is a scene of workers working hard to produce more knitted products.

　　红太阳照亮了北京针织总厂
　　↑唱段语录歌，革命豪情旺，背背“老三篇”，“公”字脑中装，越学越觉劲头足，越唱越觉心里亮。
    北京针织总厂的革命群众怀着对毛泽东思想无限崇拜的感情，大学毛主席著作，大背“老三篇”和毛主席语录，在“用”字上狠下功夫，破私立公，改造世界观。这是成衣一车间工人和支左人员一起大背“老三篇”。
　　←大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，这是八三四一部队支左人员在支左工作中牢牢掌握的一条根本原则。他们不仅给群众，而且给干部做艰苦、细致的思想工作，启发他们自觉地站出来，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在灵魂深处爆发革命，破私立公，帮助犯错误的干部正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，深刻地检查错误，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    这是支左部队负责人古远兴同志（右二）和北京针织总厂的干部一起学习毛主席的最新指示，交谈学习体会。
　　↑千钧霹雳开新宇，万里东风扫残云。北京针织总厂革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在八三四一部队支左人员的帮助下，迅速实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，于十一月十一日成立了厂革命委员会。全厂革命职工热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
　　↓林彪同志说：“要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。”八三四一部队支左人员根据林副统帅这一指示，开办了各种学习班。现在全厂已有三分之一以上的革命职工和干部参加了学习班。在学习班里，他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，畅谈大好形势，活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席的最新指示，过着“团结、紧张、严肃、活泼”的抗大式的学习生活。通过学习，促进了人的思想革命化，实现和巩固了革命的大联合、三结合，推动了本单位的斗、批、改。
    这是参加毛泽东思想学习班的同志在高唱毛主席语录歌。
　　→北京针织总厂的革命职工坚决让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。他们在实现了革命的大联合后，把过去两派用来进行互相攻击的交班本，也变成了宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。他们说：交班交语录，互相关心，互相帮助。这是青年女工下夜班时在聚精会神地往交班本上摘引毛主席语录。

　　↓北京针织总厂原来是旧北京市委在纺织系统推行修正主义路线的一个重要据点。现在全厂革命职工正奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，口诛笔伐，决心把中国赫鲁晓夫的那一套修正主义办企业路线和不合理的规章制度统统批垮、批臭，扫除垃圾，肃清毒素，把工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    这是工人们利用业余时间写批判的大字报。
　　↓毛主席教导我们，要“关心群众生活”。八三四一部队支左人员经常走访职工家庭，送去毛主席对群众的亲切关怀，送去毛泽东思想。工人无限激动地说：毛主席他老人家最关心群众。我们决心一辈子读毛主席的书，一辈子听毛主席的话，一辈子照毛主席的指示办事，一辈子为人民服务。
    这是支左部队中的医务人员到职工宿舍给工人同志看病。
    “要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”北京针织总厂革命委员会的成员把毛主席的最新指示落实到行动上，建立了新的干群关系。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓世界观的改造；坚持群众路线，到群众中去征求意见；坚持下车间参加劳动，做群众的小学生，当人民的勤务员。这是厂革委会副主任张成明（右二）在打扫车间之余和工人同志亲切交谈。
　　↑毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。由于北京针织总厂的广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，使全厂呈现一派大好形势，革命轰轰烈烈，生产热火朝天。这是工人们正在为生产更多的针织品而紧张地劳动。
