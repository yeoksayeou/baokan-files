The disguised "revolutionaries" and the fake "revolutionary family" – Refuting the reactionary film "Revolutionary Family"

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan meticulously crafted the film "Revolutionary Family," which, under the guise of recalling revolutionary history, is a poisonous weed that erects a monument to the "Left" opportunist line. This reactionary film is Xia Yan's personal practice of his advocated counter-revolutionary "heresy" theory, paving the way for China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism.

"Revolutionary Family" is set during the second phase of the domestic revolutionary war, focusing on the struggle in the white areas. Due to Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal and Chen Duxiu's capitulation within the Party, the first phase of the domestic revolutionary war, which was once so vibrant, failed. At this critical juncture, our great helmsman Chairman Mao personally led the Autumn Harvest Uprising, establishing the Jinggangshan revolutionary base area. He brilliantly and creatively opened the path to victory for the proletariat leading the peasants in armed struggle, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seizing national power. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Xia Yan brazenly opposes this sole correct line that guided the Chinese revolution to victory. He erases from the screen the red power of the Soviet areas led by Chairman Mao, the land revolution, and the anti-"encirclement" struggles. Instead, he follows the fallacy from China's Khrushchev's letter to the Central Committee, "In terms of the entire country, the work in the white areas still holds the primary position," portraying Shanghai, the temporary Central Committee's location during the "Left" opportunist line's rule, as the national revolutionary center. He extols urban underground activities as the primary form of struggle, lavishly praising urban uprisings, flying meetings, and other "Left" adventurist actions, openly opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fervently praising the "Left" opportunist line.

The film's praise for the "Left" opportunist line is primarily expressed through the characters of Jiang Meiqing and Meng Tao, among others. In the film, Xia Yan disguises these "underground workers" who appear in an extremely "Left" guise as proud revolutionaries. These "revolutionaries" wander through Changsha, Wuhan, and Shanghai, from city to city, doing everything possible to place the Party's main work in the white areas, aiming to lead the Chinese revolution with the white areas' cities as the center. These "revolutionaries" fantasize about seizing national revolutionary victory through armed uprisings and worker strikes in central cities. The film glorifies the 1928 "Hanyang New Year Uprising" under Qu Qiubai's "Left" opportunist line, highlighting Jiang Meiqing and others' adventurism and recklessness. At that time, the revolutionary situation was at a low ebb. Chairman Mao pointed out in "The Struggle in Jinggangshan," "In the past year, we have fought in various places and deeply felt the decline of the national revolutionary tide." However, the film's Jiang Meiqing and others, at the underground Hanyang County Committee meeting, loudly proclaimed, "Is the situation rising or falling? This is a problem worth studying," even openly concluding, "It is obviously rising," directly opposing Chairman Mao's correct views. To manufacture "objective grounds" for "Left" adventurism, the film's creators falsify history, using Jiang Meiqing to present letters from the "masses," disguising urban uprisings as "mass demands," and using this to loudly condemn the so-called Chen Duxiu faction, openly defending the "Left" opportunist line: "How can this be called adventurism?" Jiang Meiqing and these "revolutionaries," from the perspective of adventurism, mistakenly assessed the situation. They completely deviated from Chairman Mao's correct line of "gathering strength in the countryside, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and then seizing the cities," adopting reckless actions. The film depicts them actively responding to the erroneous slogan of a nationwide "general uprising, unified uprising," desperately "seizing the opportunity to organize the New Year uprising." When planning the New Year uprising in Hanyang, these "revolutionaries" clearly knew the enemy was on guard, and their organization had lost contact with the upper-level liaison station. However, they took even more reckless measures to advance the uprising, resulting in severe setbacks and losses for the entire revolutionary cause. "Left" opportunist Jiang Meiqing himself also became a sacrificial offering to the erroneous line in that year's New Year uprising.

Another "revolutionary" based in Shanghai's temporary central organization, Old Liu, lived in a garden villa, wore long robes and horse jackets, and lived a completely bourgeois life. Once the organization was exposed, he feared for his life, under the pretext of preserving "strength," grabbed his briefcase and fled first. The Old Liu on the screen is essentially the incarnation of China's Khrushchev off the screen. China's Khrushchev follows an opportunist line in politics and lives a completely bourgeois life. During the rule of the "Left" opportunist line, he was very close with the "Left" opportunists. In 1930, the temporary Central Committee led by Li Lisan, under the guise of a meeting in Shanghai, publicly celebrated China's Khrushchev's 30th birthday. In 1931, after the Wang Ming opportunist line was established, due to China's Khrushchev's loyal following, as soon as he returned from the Northeast to Shanghai, Wang Ming hurriedly helped him settle in an upstairs room of a hardware store on Beijing Road, just like Old Liu in the film, letting him wear long robes, wear a hat, hire a maid, and act like a wealthy businessman. This method of white-area work, under the banner of revolution, chasing a bourgeois life, is completely detached from the broad masses of workers and peasants and the fiery revolutionary struggle of the masses.

These "revolutionaries" are genuine opportunists!

To further highlight and beautify the erroneous line, the film even treats the product of the "Left" opportunist line, the "flying meeting," as the climax of the mass struggle. Although during the filming process, it received a stern criticism from a responsible comrade of the Central Committee, the anti-Party Xia Yan still paid lip service while defying orders. The film's creators specially chose the most bustling place in Shanghai as the venue for the "flying meeting," mobilizing 3,000 mass actors to participate in the performance, to enhance the grandeur, striving to use the so-called "epic background" and "grand scene" to praise the "Left" adventurist line. Xia Yan, based in Beijing, also telegraphed Shanghai, "instructing" the filming group to pay special attention to every detail of this scene's "authenticity," even specifying that the signal beer bottle must have the "Sun" brand Japanese trademark. Actions speak louder than words; Xia Yan's so-called "authenticity" is nothing more than using the film to exonerate the "Left" opportunist line of that year.

Whether it's the Hanyang uprising or the flying meeting, these are all the results of adventurism under the guidance of the "Left" opportunist line. The nonsense Xia Yan and his ilk fervently advocate is nothing more than the resurrection of Li Lisan's erroneous theory of a "new revolutionary high tide and the first victory in one or several provinces" in Shanghai and later enthusiastically followed by China's Khrushchev.

While the reactionary film "Revolutionary Family" is striving to sing the praises of the erroneous line, it is also desperately promoting the "tribulations" of revolution, peddling Xia Yan's counter-revolutionary fallacies of deviating from Mao Zedong Thought and betraying revolutionary warfare.

Look, in the years when the revolutionary storm swept across China, in the years when revolution and counter-revolution engaged in fierce struggles, what was the so-called "revolutionary family" in the film doing? Jiang Meiqing left home twice, claiming to pursue "truth," but in reality, he followed the "Left" opportunist line. The woman praised as the typical "revolutionary mother" of China, Zhou Lian, only because "heaven" gave her a husband like Jiang Meiqing, who was to her liking, and because she "couldn't let him take the risk alone," she dragged her children and traveled thousands of miles in the process of "searching for her husband," embarking on the so-called "revolutionary path." Ask: Could such a woman, who was not involved in the great revolutionary wave but only followed her husband, longing for family happiness day and night, resolutely set out on the "revolutionary journey"? In her several separations from Jiang Meiqing, we see the conflict between family and revolution, the "happiness" of Zhou Lian's family, and the serious opposition to the revolutionary cause. Here, Xia Yan uses the so-called "tragic conflict" to fully depict it. Look, sending off at the Xiang River, the long sail is far away, Zhou Lian thinks deeply and seems to have lost something; Jiang Meiqing leaves home, and Changsha is left with a "desolate and miserable" scene; Meiqing dies, and Zhou Lian thinks of the past and present, and weeps bitterly again... The film deliberately depicts these so-called most Xia Yan-style "lyrical" scenes. Which part does not seep with the poison of bourgeois humanism? Which part does not emit the mood of repentance for revolutionary struggle!

Birds of a feather flock together. Such a fake "revolutionary family," such disguised "revolutionaries," such a poisonous weed for the opportunist line, has been highly praised by China's Khrushchev and Soviet modern revisionists. After watching the film, China's Khrushchev said, "The film is good, but Zhou Lian's wedding scene lacks the local flavor of Hunan." Soviet modern revisionists loudly applauded, awarding a silver medal at the 1961 Moscow Film Festival; they also published fallacies in newspapers, saying that the film depicts "the fate of revolutionary wives is difficult. It is full of worry and danger...".

However, the wings of crows can never block the sun's rays. China's Khrushchev and Xia Yan's crimes of opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line cannot escape the judgment of 700 million revolutionary people. Today, under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's Khrushchev has been exposed, and Xia Yan and his reactionary film "Revolutionary Family" are being condemned by hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must sweep this film, its creators, and their backer, China's Khrushchev, into the garbage heap of history!

    伪装的“革命者”和冒牌的“革命家庭”
    ——斥反动影片《革命家庭》
    立红
    反革命修正主义分子夏衍精心炮制的影片《革命家庭》，是一部以回忆革命历史为名，替“左”倾机会主义路线树碑立传的大毒草。这部反动影片是夏衍亲自实践他所“倡导”的反革命“离经叛道”论，为中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义鸣锣开道的艺术标本。
    《革命家庭》是以第二次国内革命战争时期的白区斗争为题材的。由于蒋介石的叛变和党内陈独秀的投降主义，轰轰烈烈的第一次国内革命战争失败了。就在这个关键时刻，我们伟大的舵手毛主席亲自领导了秋收起义，创立了井冈山革命根据地，天才地创造性地从理论上和实践上开辟了无产阶级领导农民进行武装斗争，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国政权的胜利航道。反革命修正主义分子夏衍明目张胆地反对这条引导中国革命走向胜利的唯一正确的路线。他把毛主席领导的苏区红色政权、土地革命、反“围剿”斗争统统从银幕上一笔抹掉，却根据中国赫鲁晓夫在《关于过去白区工作给中央的一封信》中所说的“以全国范围来说，白区工作还是占着主要地位”的谬论，把“左”倾机会主义路线统治时期临时党中央所在地的上海当作全国革命中心，把城市的地下活动捧为主要的斗争方式，大肆赞扬城市暴动、飞行集会等“左”倾盲动主义的行动，公然反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，狂热地吹捧“左”倾机会主义路线。
    影片对“左”倾机会主义路线的歌颂，主要是通过江梅清、孟涛等几个“革命者”的形象来表现的。在影片中，夏衍把这几个以极“左”面貌出现的“地下工作者”，乔装打扮成神气十足的革命家。这几个“革命者”，流离长沙、武汉和上海等地，从城市到城市，千方百计地把党的主要工作放在白区，要以白区的城市为中心来领导中国革命。这几个“革命者”，幻想通过发动中心城市的武装暴动和工人罢工，夺取全国革命的胜利。影片大肆美化瞿秋白“左”倾机会主义路线指导下的一九二八年“汉阳年关暴动”，大写特写江梅清等人的盲动主义和冒险主义。当时，革命形势处于低潮，毛主席在《井冈山的斗争》一文中指出：“我们一年来转战各地，深感全国革命潮流的低落。”但是，电影剧本中的江梅清等人在地下汉阳县委会议上，大肆叫嚷什么：现在形势是“高涨还是退潮，这是一个值得研究的问题”，甚至公然提出“显然是高涨”的结论来同毛主席的正确意见分庭抗礼。为了给“左”倾盲动主义制造“客观根据”，影片的炮制者篡改历史，还通过江梅清摊出一封封“群众”来信，把举行城市暴动伪装成“群众的要求”，并以此厉声斥责那个所谓陈独秀“分子”，公开为“左”倾机会主义辩护道：“这怎么能算是盲动呢？”江梅清这几个“革命者”，从盲动主义的观点出发，错误地估计了形势，他们完全背离毛主席“在乡村聚集力量，用乡村包围城市，然后取得城市”的正确路线，而采取了冒险主义的行动。影片描写他们积极响应举行全国“总暴动，同一年起义”的错误口号，拚命“抓紧时机，组织年关暴动”。在汉阳策划年关暴动时，这几个“革命者”明明知道敌人已有所戒备，自己的机关又与上级联络站失去联系，但他们反而采取更加冒进的措施提前暴动，结果给整个革命事业带来了严重的挫折和损失，而“左”倾机会主义者江梅清本人也就在这次年关暴动中成了错误路线的殉葬品。
    另一个坐镇上海临时中央机关的“革命者”老刘，住的是花园洋房，穿的是长袍马褂，过的是完全资产阶级化的生活。一旦机关暴露，他唯恐送掉狗命，在保存“实力”的幌子下，夹了公事皮包拔脚先溜。银幕上的老刘实际上就是银幕下的中国赫鲁晓夫的化身。中国赫鲁晓夫在政治上实行机会主义的路线，生活上也完全资产阶级化。在“左”倾机会主义统治时期，他与“左”倾机会主义者打得十分火热。一九三○年，以李立三为首的临时中央在上海借开会之名，曾公然为中国赫鲁晓夫“隆重”祝贺三十寿辰。一九三一年，王明机会主义路线确立以后，又由于中国赫鲁晓夫追随有功，当他刚从东北回到上海，王明就忙不迭地帮他安家在北京路的一家五金店楼上，象影片中的老刘一样，让他穿上长袍，戴上礼帽，雇上“娘姨”，俨然是一个腰缠万贯的大老板。这种打着革命的招牌追逐资产阶级生活的所谓白区工作的方式，完全是脱离广大工农群众和火热的革命群众斗争的。
    这些“革命者”是地地道道的机会主义分子！
    影片为了进一步突出和美化错误路线，竟把“左”倾机会主义路线的产物“飞行集会”，作为群众斗争的高潮来处理。虽然在影片摄制过程中，受到了党中央一位负责同志的严正批评，但是，反党成性的夏衍却阳奉阴违。影片的炮制者特地挑选上海最热闹的地点作为“飞行集会”的场地，并动员三千名群众演员参加演出，以壮声威，力求用所谓“史诗式的背景”和“壮阔的场面”来歌颂“左”倾盲动主义路线。坐镇北京的夏衍还专电上海，“指示”摄制组要特别注意这场戏的每一个细节的“真实”，即使连作为信号的啤酒瓶，也点明非要贴上“太阳牌”的日本商标不可。言为心声，夏衍的所谓“真实”，无非就是要影片为当年“左”倾机会主义路线翻案。
    汉阳暴动也好，飞行集会也好，这都是“左”倾机会主义路线指导下盲动主义的结果。夏衍之流所狂热鼓吹的这一套，完全是当年李立三在上海所鼓吹的、也是后来中国赫鲁晓夫热中奉行的什么“新的革命高潮和一省或几省的首先胜利”的错误理论的借尸还魂。
    《革命家庭》这部反动影片在竭力讴歌错误路线的同时，还拚命宣扬革命的“劫难”，兜售夏衍的离毛泽东思想之经、叛革命战争之道的反革命谬论。
    且看在革命风暴席卷中国的年代里，在革命与反革命进行残酷斗争的岁月里，影片标榜的这个“革命家庭”在干些什么呢？江梅清两次离家，美其名曰：追求“真理”，实际上是追随“左”倾机会主义路线。被吹捧为中国“革命母亲”典型的周莲，也只是由于“老天爷”给了她一个象江梅清这样“称心如意”的丈夫，由于“不能让他一个人担风险”，因而拖儿带女，仆仆风尘，在“千里寻夫”的过程中，走上了所谓“革命道路”。试问：象这么一个根本没有卷进大革命浪潮，而只是一心跟定了丈夫，日夜向往于天伦之乐的“贤妻良母”，能毅然踏上革命的“征途”吗？在她与江梅清的几次生离死别中，我们看到的，是家庭和革命的矛盾，是周莲一家的“幸福”和革命事业的严重对立。这里，夏衍正是运用所谓“悲剧性冲突”来尽情渲染的。你看，湘水送别，长帆远去，周莲沉思之余，若有所失；江梅清离家，长沙留下的又是一片“荒凉凄惨”的景象；梅清死去，周莲思前顾后，又伏案大恸起来……。影片蓄意渲染这些所谓最具有夏衍“风格”的“抒情”场面，哪一处不是渗透了资产阶级人性论的毒汁，哪一处不是散发着对革命斗争的忏悔情绪！
    物以类聚，人以群分。这么一个冒牌的“革命家庭”，这么几个伪装的“革命者”，这么一部为机会主义路线招魂的大毒草，博得了中国赫鲁晓夫和苏联现代修正主义者的大肆吹捧。中国赫鲁晓夫看了影片以后说：“影片很好，只是周莲出嫁一场，湖南的风土人情味还嫌不足”。苏联现代修正主义者大声喝采，在一九六一年莫斯科电影节上授予银质奖章；还在报刊上大发谬论，说什么这部影片描写了“革命者的妻子的命运是艰难的。充满了担忧和危险的生活……”。
    但是，乌鸦的翅膀永远遮不住太阳的光辉。中国赫鲁晓夫和夏衍之流反对毛主席革命路线的罪行，决逃脱不了七亿革命人民的审判。今天，在毛主席亲自发动和领导下的无产阶级文化大革命中，中国赫鲁晓夫被揪出来了，夏衍和他的反动影片《革命家庭》正在受到亿万工农兵的口诛笔伐。我们一定要把这部影片和他的炮制者以及它们的后台中国赫鲁晓夫一起扫进历史的垃圾堆！
