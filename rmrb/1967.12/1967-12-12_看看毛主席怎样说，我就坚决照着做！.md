Every time there are problems in thought, work, or life, what should one do? Platoon leader Pang Chaosheng always opens Chairman Mao's works first:

“Let's see what Chairman Mao says, and I will definitely follow it!”

When the Red Guards first emerged, Platoon leader Pang Chaosheng heard some misguided comments and rumors about this new revolutionary force.

Late at night, Pang Chaosheng returned from the construction site, without washing his face or changing his damp work clothes, he opened “Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan” with Yu Dexiang under the oil lamp to see what Chairman Mao says. “Let's see what Chairman Mao says, and I will definitely follow it!” This has been Pang Chaosheng's principle for the past seven years of marching forward on the revolutionary path guided by Chairman Mao.

Under the lamplight, the two were engrossed in reading Chairman Mao's works and writing notes. Pang Chaosheng excitedly said to Yu Dexiang, “Chairman Mao's words are all so heartfelt. I love the Red Guards of Chairman Mao! It is they who have thoroughly criticized the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and all the ghosts and monsters; it is they who bravely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Their revolutionary actions are excellent, absolutely excellent! The more the enemy opposes, the more I support!”

The two talked more and more excitedly, and before they knew it, the clock had struck eleven. Pang Chaosheng then said to Yu Dexiang with concern, “It's late, go to sleep.” Yu Dexiang held Pang's hand and said, “You've been working hard on the construction site all day, you should rest too.” Pang Chaosheng said, “Okay, I'll go to sleep right away.” Yu Dexiang closed the book and laid out the bed, and soon fell asleep.

When Yu Dexiang woke up from his sleep, he vaguely felt that the lamp in the room was still on and the platoon leader's bed was empty. He quickly got up and saw that the platoon leader was still sitting under the lamp, deeply engrossed in reading Chairman Mao's works. He walked over to the platoon leader and saw that his face, covered in mud and water, showed no signs of fatigue, but his eyes were filled with red veins and tears. Yu Dexiang, with concern, said, “Platoon leader, what if you ruin your eyes?” Pang Chaosheng smiled indifferently and said, “A revolutionary soldier without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is blind even with good eyes; as long as Mao Zedong Thought is established as the absolute authority in one's mind, even if the eyes are bad, the heart will be clear!”

Yu Dexiang saw the platoon leader looking up at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging high on the wall with deep affection, and he understood everything. He remembered the song that the platoon leader loved to sing the most:

I love to read Chairman Mao's book,
I study it thousands and tens of thousands of times,
Chairman Mao's rain nourishes me,
I work with revolutionary vigor.

### “看看毛主席怎样说，我就坚决照着做！”

专栏：

　　每当在思想上、工作上、生活上遇到问题的时候，怎么办？班长庞朝胜总是先打开毛主席著作：
　　“看看毛主席怎样说，我就坚决照着做！”
    当红卫兵刚刚出现的时候，班长庞朝胜听到一些对这个革命的新生事物不理解的议论和风言风语。
    深夜，庞朝胜从工地回来，脸没洗，潮湿的工作服也顾不得换，就和“一对红”于德祥在煤油灯下，打开了《湖南农民运动考察报告》这篇光辉著作，看看毛主席是怎样说的。“看看毛主席怎样说，我就坚决照着做！”这是庞朝胜入伍七年来，在毛主席指引的革命大路上不断前进的准则。
    灯影下，两个人在全神贯注地读毛主席的书，写心得笔记。庞朝胜激动地对于德祥说：“毛主席的话，句句都说到了咱的心坎上。我爱毛主席的红卫兵！是他们，大造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神的反；是他们，勇敢地捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们的革命行动好得很，就是好得很！敌人越是反对，我就越是支持！”两个人越谈越兴奋，不知不觉时针已经指向了十一点。这时，庞朝胜关切地对于德祥说：“天不早了，睡吧。”于德祥拉着班长的手说：“你在工地上劳累了一天，也该休息了。”庞朝胜说：“好，我马上就睡。”于德祥合上书，铺好了被子，一会就睡着了。……
    等于德祥一觉醒来，懵懵懂懂地觉着屋里的灯还亮着，班长的床也空着。他一骨碌爬起来，只见班长还端坐在灯下，专心致志地读毛主席的书。他轻步走到班长跟前，见班长满是泥水的脸上毫无倦意，一双眼睛却布满了条条红丝，还不住地淌泪水。于德祥知道班长这几天正害眼病，就疼爱地说：“班长，你把眼睛熬坏了咋办？”庞朝胜毫不在意地笑了笑，说：“一个革命战士，如果没有毛泽东思想的指引，眼睛再好，也是‘睁眼瞎’；只要头脑里树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威，即使眼睛坏了，心里也会通明透亮！”于德祥见班长边说边无限深情地仰望着墙上高挂的毛主席像，心里全明白了——他想起了班长平日里最爱唱的那首歌：
    毛主席的书我最爱读，
    千遍那个万遍呀下功夫，……
    毛主席的雨露滋养了我呀，
    我干起那革命劲头儿足。……
