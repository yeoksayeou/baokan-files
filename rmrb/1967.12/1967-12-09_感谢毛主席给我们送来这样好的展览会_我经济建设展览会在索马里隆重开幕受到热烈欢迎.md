Hargeisa Deputy Governor Aden Haji Mohammed cut the ribbon for the exhibition and delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. He highly praised the achievements made by the Chinese people in a short period of time and expressed his belief that this exhibition would contribute to further strengthening the friendship between Somalia and China.

Chinese Economic Exhibition Team Leader Zheng Peitang briefly introduced the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao in the fields of industry, agriculture, and science, as well as the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Many Somali friends left messages in the guest book, enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. One viewer wrote: "I sincerely thank Chairman Mao for bringing us such a wonderful exhibition. We Somali people love Chairman Mao and will definitely follow the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong." Another viewer wrote: "In this exhibition, I saw a variety of high-quality products. These are all created by the Chinese people following Chairman Mao's teachings." "Long live Mao Zedong! The red sun rises from the East, and its rays shine over the entire globe."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, the *Voice of Somalia* newspaper commented on the handover of the National Theater, a gift from the Chinese government to Somalia, to the Somali government on December 4, saying: "It is well known that China's aid to all countries is selfless, aiming to develop these countries; on the contrary, the aid from colonialist countries is conditional, aiming to economically and politically enslave the recipient countries." The commentary pointed out that the National Theater donated by the Chinese government will strengthen the friendly relations between the two peoples. The commentary said: "We thank Chairman Mao Zedong for the precious gift to the Somali government and people, and we will always remember this precious gift." The commentary said: "We shout: Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live the great People's Republic of China!"

    “感谢毛主席给我们送来这样好的展览会”
    我经济建设展览会在索马里隆重开幕受到热烈欢迎
    据新华社哈尔格萨电　中华人民共和国经济建设展览会十一月三十日下午在索马里北部首府哈尔格萨隆重开幕。
    当地军、政首脑和各界朋友约三百人出席了展览会的开幕式。客人们看了展品后，高度赞扬中国人民在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下所取得的巨大成就。
    哈尔格萨州副州长阿丁·哈吉·穆罕默德为展览会剪彩，并在开幕式上发表讲话。他高度赞扬中国人民在短短的时间内所取得的成就，并表示相信，这个展览会将为进一步加强索马里和中国之间的友谊作出贡献。
    中国经济展览团团长郑佩堂在开幕式上简单地介绍了中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在工业、农业和科学等战线上所取得的伟大成就以及毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。
    许多索马里朋友在观众留言簿上留言，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。一位观众写道：“我衷心感谢毛主席给我们送来了这样美好的展览会。我们索马里人民热爱毛主席，一定遵循毛泽东主席的教导办事。”有的观众写道：“在这个展览会上，我看到了品种繁多、质量精良的产品，这些都是中国人民遵循毛主席的教导创造出来的。”“毛泽东万岁！红太阳从东方升起，它的光芒普照整个地球。”
    据新华社摩加迪沙电　《索马里之声报》四日就中国政府赠送给索马里的国家剧院移交给索马里政府一事发表评论说：“众所周知，中国给所有国家的援助都是无私的，目的是要发展这些国家；相反，殖民主义国家的援助是附有条件的，目的是从经济上、政治上奴役受援国。”评论指出，中国政府赠送的索马里国家剧院，将加强两国人民之间的友好关系。评论说：“我们感谢毛泽东主席赠送给索马里政府和人民的珍贵礼物，我们将永远记得这个珍贵礼物。”评论说：“我们高呼：毛泽东主席万岁！伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！”
