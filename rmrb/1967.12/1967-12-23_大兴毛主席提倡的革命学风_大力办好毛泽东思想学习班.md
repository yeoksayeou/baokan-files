If one has made mistakes, one must engage in self-criticism. Do not always assume that you are right, as if the truth is always in your hands. Do not always think that only you are capable, and that everyone else is not, as if the world would stop turning without you.		Mao Zedong

Promote the Revolutionary Learning Style Advocated by Chairman Mao and Vigorously Conduct Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes

The broad masses of revolutionaries, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary soldiers across the country are determined to swiftly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to achieve the integration of theory with practice, to engage in more self-criticism, to teach and learn from each other, to launch a larger-scale mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary soldiers across the country have decided to establish the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, to vigorously conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, to launch a larger-scale mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today's important editorial in the People's Daily, "Vigorously Conduct Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes," conveys Chairman Mao's teachings on establishing a revolutionary learning style and his latest instructions on conducting serious self-criticism. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary soldiers across the country have studied it repeatedly and received great education and inspiration. They have expressed their determination to resolutely and swiftly implement Chairman Mao's teachings and latest instructions in their actions, to make the Mao Zedong Thought study classes even better.

The Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a full committee meeting today to specifically study and discuss the editorial in the People's Daily. Everyone unanimously agreed that following Chairman Mao's teachings to establish a revolutionary learning style, to vigorously conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and to further launch a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Municipal Revolutionary Committee, the Tianjin Military Support Liaison Station, and the leadership of the Tianjin Garrison of the People's Liberation Army jointly issued a notice proposing four specific measures for swift implementation: (1) Immediately launch a large-scale, high-profile, and vigorous propaganda campaign to widely publicize the great significance of conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes and the great significance of establishing a revolutionary learning style, so that everyone knows about it. (2) Units that have not conducted Mao Zedong Thought study classes should immediately start, universally conduct, and comprehensively conduct them, solving the issue of learning style in the first class and raising the classes to a new level. (3) Immediately prepare to hold a city-wide experience-sharing conference on conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes and criticizing and repudiating revisionism. (4) The first leaders at all levels and the main responsible persons of representative conferences and mass organizations should focus their main efforts on conducting the study classes and vigorously publicize and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The ongoing conference of red guards representatives from colleges and universities in Zhejiang Province today also passed a decision on seriously studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, issuing a call to the red guards across the province: (1) Immediately launch a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be seriously studied, deeply understood, and resolutely implemented. We must resolutely oppose those who talk revolution but do not act, and become true revolutionaries. (2) In colleges and universities across the province, swiftly and universally conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the participation of revolutionary mass organizations from both sides or various sides, focusing on "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "each doing more self-criticism, seeking great unity and tolerating small differences." Through conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," promote and consolidate revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations, and push forward the deep development of revolutionary great criticism. (3) Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, compare oneself with the five conditions of a revolutionary successor, strictly demand of oneself, fiercely fight against the "self" in one's mind, and spark a revolution in one's soul to promote thought reform, turning the red guards organization into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Recently, with the strong support and help of the People's Liberation Army, the responsible persons of revolutionary red guards and revolutionary student organizations in the Wuhan area jointly conducted Mao Zedong Thought study classes, following Chairman Mao's teachings, focusing on "criticizing and repudiating revisionism," and quickly reached an agreement on achieving revolutionary great unity among revolutionary student organizations across the city. The Preparatory Committee of the Red Guards Congress of Mao Zedong Thought in Wuhan Area of Colleges and Universities was established. The responsible persons and staff of the "Red Guards Preparatory Committee" insist on studying Chairman Mao's works for half a day and working for half a day every day, integrating learning with application, determined to turn the preparatory process of the Red Guards Congress into a process of further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and criticizing and repudiating revisionism, turning the "Red Guards Preparatory Committee" into a Mao Zedong Thought study class, continuing to strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, and achieve new merits in promoting revolutionary great unity.

Revolutionary cadres, representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army studying in the second period of the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee linked their learning situation with the editorial for self-examination, found gaps, and proposed measures for future implementation. They believe that to establish a revolutionary learning style according to Chairman Mao's teachings, the most fundamental thing is to grasp the spirit of loyalty, to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With a spirit of loyalty, a revolutionary learning style can be established, and learning can be integrated with application; learning can be applied; private matters can be exposed without fear of ugliness, and self-criticism can be conducted without fear of pain; one can correctly treat oneself, correctly treat the masses, and correctly treat cadres.

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Jinan Locomotive Factory, in conjunction with the experience of previous study classes held by the factory, discussed the editorial in the People's Daily. They said that to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, the most important thing is to establish a revolutionary learning style that integrates theory with practice. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must be able to master it and apply it. The purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Whether to apply what one has learned from Chairman Mao's works or to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a serious stance issue. Some people learn Chairman Mao's works but only follow others and not themselves, treating others with Marxism-Leninism but practicing liberalism towards themselves. This learning attitude boils down to one word: "self." Starting from "self" and from petty-bourgeois factionalism to learn Chairman Mao's works will inevitably drift further and further away from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. To further establish a revolutionary learning style that integrates theory with practice, they also seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Reform Our Study" and "Rectify Party Style." The students expressed their determination to follow Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, to truly study Chairman Mao's works with questions, to study and apply actively, to integrate study with application, to study urgently what is needed immediately, to achieve immediate results, and to focus on the "application."

After studying the editorial in the People's Daily, the responsible persons of the third period of the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress specially emphasized that Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be implemented in three aspects: thought, work, and effect. The responsible persons of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters emphasized that they must definitely print Chairman Mao's latest instruction of "each doing more self-criticism" in their minds and implement it in their actions, to establish a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The cadres of the agricultural and forestry system in Qinghai Province seriously studied the editorial in the People's Daily. The responsible persons of the revolutionary mass organizations in this system said that from practice, they deeply felt that cadres and masses jointly conducting study classes can place cadres among the masses, listen to the masses' opinions at any time, receive the masses' help, cultivate a mass perspective, and promote thought reform. They resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call and conducted the study classes well with the masses.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary soldiers across the country have expressed their determination to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings and latest instructions, to implement them sentence by sentence and word by word, to vigorously conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and to strive for a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces have seriously studied the editorial in the People's Daily, "Vigorously Conduct Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes," and resolutely expressed their determination to establish the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary learning style personally advocated by Chairman Mao, to further vigorously conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the coming new year.

The teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao on establishing a revolutionary learning style and his latest instructions on conducting serious self-criticism, conveyed in the editorial of the People's Daily, have greatly inspired the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the three services. From various military camps to the front lines of the sea and border defense, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have listened to and studied the editorial of the People's Daily repeatedly. Many soldiers and officers held oath-taking meetings and mobilization meetings immediately after listening to the broadcast. Many military leadership organs issued notices to their subordinate units, requiring them to seriously summarize experiences, establish and carry forward a revolutionary learning style, and conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes more vigorously and effectively.

The various headquarters, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the leadership organs of various military branches, and the Beijing Garrison, as well as the soldiers and officers of the three services stationed in Shanghai, pointed out in their study and discussion meetings that in the current favorable situation, establishing the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary learning style consistently advocated by Chairman Mao, conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and further launching a new high tide of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works are the fundamental guarantees for promoting the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The soldiers and officers of the garrison unit on a certain island in the Yellow Sea said that the revolutionary learning style personally advocated by Chairman Mao is not only the guideline for conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes but also the guideline for promoting the thought reform of the billion people across the country. Whether to apply what one has learned from Chairman Mao's works is a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. We must implement the revolutionary learning style personally advocated by Chairman Mao in the study classes and in all actions.

The soldiers and officers of the armies in Shenyang, Jinan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Lanzhou, and other places, in conjunction with their personal experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and participating in study classes for cadres and soldiers, seriously studied the editorial in the People's Daily and unanimously agreed that only by using the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes can Chairman Mao's works be truly mastered, and new levels of study and application can be continuously achieved. They said that conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, the first important issue is to establish a revolutionary learning style, that is, to integrate theory with practice and to conduct serious self-criticism. Studying Mao Zedong Thought, learning but not applying, or only talking but not doing, is disloyal to Chairman Mao. Only by integrating theory with practice and focusing on the "application" can a revolution be sparked in one's soul.

Many cadres participating in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various units talked about the deep education they received from conducting serious self-criticism and criticizing and repudiating revisionism together with the soldiers in the study classes. They said that to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes well with "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key, one must strictly conduct serious self-criticism. Criticizing and repudiating revisionism means starting from "exposing" and focusing on "fighting," actively treating oneself as the object of revolution, daring to launch an offensive against "self." Only by overthrowing "self" in serious self-criticism can one act according to Mao Zedong Thought at all times, in all matters, and in all places.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the armies in Kunming, Fuzhou, Chengdu, and the military regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet firmly expressed in their study and discussion meetings that they must let the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao be universally carried forward in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Many cadres and soldiers wrote determination letters to establish a revolutionary learning style, determined to closely integrate with the actual class struggle, their own thought and work actuality, and diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fiercely fight against selfishness, and accelerate the realization of thought reform. The party committee of a certain unit of the Inner Mongolian garrison, according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the spirit of the editorial in the People's Daily, immediately held a meeting to summarize and check the situation of conducting study classes in the previous period, and proposed specific measures to establish a revolutionary learning style with Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline. They called on the troops to further conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, achieve new levels of study and application, and achieve new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement.

    天津市革命委员会今天召开全体委员会议，专门学习和讨论了《人民日报》社论。大家一致认为，遵照毛主席的教导，建立革命的好学风，大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，这是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证。市革委会、天津驻军支左联络站和中国人民解放军天津警备区领导机关联合发出通知，提出了四点迅速落实的具体措施：（一）立即开展一个大规模的、声势浩大的、轰轰烈烈的宣传活动，大讲办好毛泽东思想学习班的伟大意义，大讲建立革命好学风的伟大意义，做到家喻户晓，人人皆知。（二）没有办毛泽东思想学习班的单位，要立即上马，普遍地办，全面地办，第一堂课就要解决学风问题，把学习班提高到新水平。（三）立即筹备召开全市性的办好毛泽东思想学习班和斗私批修的经验交流会。（四）各级领导的第一把手和各代表会议以及群众组织的主要负责人，都要以主要精力抓好学习班的工作，大力宣传认真贯彻毛主席的最新指示。
    正在杭州召开的浙江省大中专院校红卫兵代表大会，今天也通过了关于认真学习和坚决执行毛主席最新指示的决定，向全省广大红卫兵发出号召：（一）立即掀起一个活学活用毛主席最新指示的高潮。对毛主席的最新指示，必须认真学习，细加体会，雷厉风行，坚决照办。要坚决反对口头革命派，作一个真正的无产阶级革命派。（二）在全省大中专院校中迅速大办有两派或各派革命群众组织参加的毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，落实毛主席的最新指示，“各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，推动革命大批判的深入开展。（三）通过活学活用毛主席的最新指示，对照革命接班人的五个条件，严格要求自己，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命，促进思想革命化，把红卫兵组织办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    武汉地区革命红卫兵和革命学生组织的负责人，最近在中国人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，共同开办毛泽东思想学习班，遵照毛主席的教导，以“斗私，批修”为纲，“各自多做自我批评”，很快达成了全市革命学生组织实现革命大联合的协议，成立了毛泽东思想红卫兵武汉地区大、中学校代表大会筹备委员会。“红代筹”的负责人和工作人员每天坚持半天学习毛主席著作、半天工作，学用结合，决心把红代会的筹备过程作为进一步活学活用毛主席著作，进一步贯彻执行毛主席最新指示和斗私批修的过程，把“红代筹”办成一个毛泽东思想学习班，继续增强无产阶级的党性，克服小资产阶级的派性，在促进革命大联合中为人民立新功。
    正在黑龙江省革命委员会第二期毛泽东思想学习班学习的革命领导干部、革命群众组织代表和解放军同志，联系自己的学习情况，对照社论进行检查，找出差距，提出了今后贯彻执行的措施。他们认为，要按照毛主席的教导建立起革命的好学风，最根本的一条是要抓住一个忠字，做到无限忠于毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。有了一个忠字，革命的好学风就能够建立起来，就能够做到学用结合，学了就用；做到亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕疼；就能够正确地对待自己，正确地对待群众，正确地对待干部。
    在济南机车工厂毛泽东思想学习班学习的革命干部和革命工人，联系本厂前几期举办学习班的经验，座谈了《人民日报》社论。他们说，要办好毛泽东思想学习班，最重要的是建立起理论联系实际的革命学风。毛主席教导我们：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”学了毛主席著作，用还是不用；学了毛主席的最新指示，执行还是不执行，这是对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的根本态度问题，是一个严肃的立场问题。有的人学了毛主席著作，只照别人，不照自己，对别人是马列主义，对自己则实行自由主义，这种学习态度归结到一点，就是一个私字。从私字出发，从小资产阶级的派性出发，去学习毛主席著作，势必离开毛主席的革命路线越来越远。他们为了进一步建立起理论联系实际的革命学风，还认真学习了毛主席的《改造我们的学习》、《整顿党的作风》等光辉著作。学员们表示，一定要遵照林副主席的指示，真正做到学习毛主席著作带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    北京市工代会第三期毛泽东思想学习班负责人学习了《人民日报》社论以后，特别强调对毛主席的最新指示一定要做到三个落实，即：思想落实、工作落实和效果落实。上海工人革命造反总司令部负责人着重表示，一定要把毛主席的“各自多做自我批评”的最新指示，印在脑子里，落实在行动上，树立全心全意为人民服务的世界观，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    青海省农林系统的机关干部，认真学习了《人民日报》社论。这个系统的革命群众组织的负责人说，我们从实践中深深地体会到，干部和群众联合举办学习班，可以使干部置身于群众之中，随时听取群众的意见，得到群众的帮助，培养群众观点，促进思想革命化。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，和群众一起把学习班办得好上加好。
    各地广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部纷纷表示，对毛主席的教导和最新指示，一定要反复学习，句句落实，字字照办，要大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面彻底胜利而奋斗。
    新华社二十二日讯　人民解放军陆海空三军指战员，认真学习《人民日报》社论《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》，坚决表示一定要建立毛主席亲自倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，进一步大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，在即将到来的新的一年里，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    《人民日报》社论传达的伟大领袖毛主席关于建立革命学风问题的教导，毛主席关于认真进行自我批评的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了三军广大指战员。从各部队营区到万里海防、边防，广大指战员一遍又一遍地收听和学习了《人民日报》社论。许多部队指战员收听广播后，立即召开了誓师大会和动员大会。许多部队的领导机关向所属单位发出通知，要求认真总结经验，树立和发扬革命的好学风，把毛泽东思想学习班办得更加生气勃勃，更有成效。
    各总部、国防科委、各军种兵种领导机关和北京部队，以及驻沪三军指战员在学习座谈中指出，在当前大好形势下，建立毛主席一贯倡导的马克思列宁主义的革命好学风，办好毛泽东思想学习班，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮，这是推动无产阶级文化大革命胜利发展的根本保证，也是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的根本保证。黄海前哨某守岛部队毛泽东思想学习班的干部、战士，联系自己斗私批修、促进思想革命化的体会说，毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，不仅是办好毛泽东思想学习班的指针，也是促进全国亿万军民思想革命化的指针。学了毛主席著作用还是不用，这是对待毛主席、对待毛泽东思想的根本态度问题。我们一定要把毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风，贯彻到学习班中去，贯彻到一切行动中去。
    沈阳、济南、南京、广州、武汉、兰州等部队指战员，结合自己活学活用毛主席著作和参加干部战士同学的学习班的亲身体会，认真学习了《人民日报》社论，一致认为，只有用毛主席提倡的革命学风，办好毛泽东思想学习班，才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手，才能不断地学出新水平，用出新水平。他们说，办好毛泽东思想学习班，第一个重要问题就是要建立一个革命的好学风，就是要理论联系实际，进行认真的自我批评。学习毛泽东思想，学了不用，或只说不做，就是对毛主席的不忠。只有理论联系实际，在“用”字上狠下功夫，才能在灵魂深处爆发革命。
    各部队正在参加毛泽东思想学习班学习的许多干部，谈到在学习班里进行认真的自我批评、同战士一起斗私批修受到的深刻教育时说，以“斗私，批修”为纲，办好毛泽东思想学习班，一定要严格地进行认真的自我批评。斗私，就要从“亮”字出发，立足于“斗”字上，主动把自己当做革命的对象，敢于向“私”字打进攻战。只有在认真的自我批评中把“私”字斗倒，才能做到时时、事事、处处按毛泽东思想办事。
    昆明、福州、成都部队和内蒙古、新疆、西藏军区广大指战员在学习、座谈中，坚决表示，一定要让毛主席提倡的革命好学风，在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中，在毛泽东思想学习班里，普遍地发扬光大。许多干部战士写了大立革命好学风的决心书，决心做到紧密地联系阶级斗争的实际，联系自己的思想实际和工作实际，刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗私心，加速实现思想革命化。内蒙古驻军某部党委按照毛主席的指示和《人民日报》社论的精神，立即开会检查总结了前一段办学习班的情况，并提出了以毛泽东思想为指针，大立革命好学风的具体措施，号召部队进一步办好毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，学出新水平，用出新水平，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中为人民立新功。
