People's armed forces in South Vietnam have achieved brilliant results in consecutive attacks. The people's armed forces in Kien Giang Province launched a fierce assault on an enemy airfield near Kien Giang City on the night of December 20, destroying 27 enemy aircraft.

The report said that on the night of December 20, the soldiers of the people's liberation armed forces, with the active support of the local people, cleverly and bravely broke through the enemy's layers of defenses and directly attacked the enemy's airfield. As soon as the battle began, the people's liberation armed forces destroyed the enemy's defensive positions. Immediately afterward, the assault team members of the people's liberation armed forces rushed into the enemy's parking lot and blew up 27 enemy aircraft of various types.

The report said that under the heavy blows of the people's liberation armed forces, the four companies of puppet troops and one platoon of American troops guarding the airfield, in order to save their lives, hurriedly hid in the fortifications and dared not come out for a long time. Only after the people's liberation armed forces withdrew did they timidly crawl out.

After the battle, the people of Kien Giang City and the surrounding villages beat drums and gongs, celebrating the great victory of the people's liberation armed forces.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi, the military and civilians of West Ninh Province in South Vietnam, who have been victorious in every battle, fought against the enemy multiple times from December 8 to December 20. They killed more than 1,100 enemy soldiers, including 640 American invaders; completely annihilated three enemy infantry companies, one artillery company, and one battalion headquarters; shot down 18 helicopters, destroyed 17 armored vehicles and transport vehicles, and five cannons; and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.
