	Cambodian Government Condemns South Vietnamese Puppet's War Threats

	The Cambodian News Agency on December 5 released a statement from the Royal Government of Cambodia condemning the recent war threats made by the puppet regime of Nguyen Van Thieu in South Vietnam, claiming the right to invade Cambodian territory.

	The statement said: The Royal Government of Cambodia must point out that there are no forces of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam or the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on Cambodian soil.

	The statement said, The Royal Government of Cambodia solemnly declares that the Cambodian armed forces will resist any invading forces from the South Vietnamese puppet regime just as they would any other aggressor.

	Johnson Scrambles to Fill Vietnam War Casualties

	The U.S. Navy announced on December 7 that it would redeploy sailors from the Atlantic Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean to make up for shortages in the Navy during the Vietnam War.

	Reports indicate that the Johnson administration will reduce the number of sailors on certain ships in the Atlantic Fleet to the minimum, in order to recruit more than six thousand additional troops for the Vietnam War. The U.S. Navy admits that this measure will reduce or halt the activities of some ships in the Atlantic Fleet, leaving them in a half-dead state of "guard duty."

	Indonesian Reactionaries' Dark Rule Causes Severe Food Shortages

	Under the reactionary rule of the fascist military regime in Indonesia, agricultural production has been severely damaged, leading to a significant reduction in the main staple food—rice—and exacerbating the food crisis. Reports indicate that in many places in Jakarta, one can see "crowds of impoverished people, including the elderly and even children, lining up to buy rice." They start queuing from midnight, and in some places from 10 p.m. the previous evening, until the next morning.

	Rice prices in Indonesia are soaring daily. Reports indicate that by the beginning of October, the price of rice in Central and East Java had doubled on average. In Yogyakarta, West Sumatra, the price of rice rose from 45 rupiah per kilogram to 200 rupiah.
