The experience of Gangdong Production Brigade is as follows: First, it can consolidate and develop the results of self-criticism and anti-revisionism at the brigade and production team levels; second, meetings are convenient and lively in form; third, it facilitates mutual help and learning, promoting collective improvement; fourth, it is conducive to family harmony and the establishment of new family relationships.

Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, December 16 — The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Gangdong Production Brigade, Wanggezhuang People's Commune, Laoshan County, Qingdao City, have actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "criticize and repudiate oneself and oppose revisionism." They have organized self-criticism and anti-revisionism activities within families, making the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary criticism more widespread and in-depth. Mao Zedong Thought has been propagated, popularized, and applied on an unprecedented scale. The struggle against selfishness and for public-mindedness has touched the soul of every individual, fundamentally changing people's spiritual outlook, and the revolutionary and production situations are excellent.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Gangdong Production Brigade have followed Chairman Mao's instructions on peasants also criticizing the bourgeoisie. Since August this year, they have actively participated in the revolutionary criticism movement. They have criticized revisionist fallacies spread by Liu Shaoqi in brigade meetings, in the fields, and at home. Brigade cadres found that holding criticism meetings at home achieved good results, so they summarized and promoted this practice and actively cultivated cadres in each household to lead revolutionary criticism. After Chairman Mao issued the latest directive to "criticize and repudiate oneself and oppose revisionism," the poor and lower-middle peasants of this brigade further took "criticize and repudiate oneself and oppose revisionism" as the guiding principle. While organizing large-scale criticism within the production team and brigade, they also held family self-criticism and anti-revisionism meetings. Practice has proven that such family self-criticism and anti-revisionism meetings have many advantages and are a good form for deepening revolutionary criticism and popularizing Mao Zedong Thought in rural areas. Its main advantages are:

First, it can consolidate and develop the results of self-criticism and anti-revisionism at the brigade and production team levels, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions. As the rural revolutionary criticism deepens, many people's selfish thoughts, which have lost their market in public settings, often still find a place in the family. Holding self-criticism and anti-revisionism meetings within the family can eliminate any hiding place for selfish thoughts, allowing public-mindedness to flourish. Some members who did not reveal their selfish thoughts in multiple self-criticism and anti-revisionism meetings held by the brigade and production team finally exposed their selfish thoughts when they saw the entire family criticizing and repudiating selfishness in the family meeting. They analyzed and criticized it from the height of the struggle between the two lines, further firming their resolve to follow the socialist path.

Second, meetings are convenient, can be held during meal or rest times, are lively in form, and achieve good results. Member Wang Ruijiao's family of eleven held a family criticism meeting during lunch. During the meeting, the mother, eldest daughter-in-law, and youngest daughter all examined their selfish thoughts in handling personal and collective relationships. Finally, the eldest daughter summarized the meeting. The whole family held a meeting during one meal, and those who rarely spoke in brigade or production team meetings all spoke up. Everyone felt they had gained a lot.

Third, it facilitates mutual help and learning, promoting collective improvement. The whole family studies Chairman Mao's works together, criticizes and repudiates selfishness together, holds remembrance meetings, and eats remembrance meals, quickly raising class consciousness. In some families, educated youth use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to summarize and elevate the content of the family's self-criticism and anti-revisionism, thus better helping the whole family improve their political and ideological level and better grasp Mao Zedong Thought.

Fourth, holding self-criticism and anti-revisionism meetings within the family not only can be sustained long-term but also helps resolve family disputes, promote family harmony, and establish new socialist family relationships. Member Liu Ruilian has three sons. In the past, because of selfishness, each person only cared for themselves, and they did not speak to each other for a long time. After participating in family self-criticism and anti-revisionism meetings, through studying Chairman Mao's works and criticizing and repudiating selfishness, the whole family reached a new level of unity on a new ideological foundation. Because each member of the family takes Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, mutually engages in criticism and self-criticism, this further eliminates the remnants of feudal ideas such as clan authority, paternal authority, and male authority, and a new type of family relationship is taking shape.

### 召开家庭斗私批修会效果很好

　　召开家庭斗私批修会效果很好
    港东大队的经验是：一、能巩固和发展大队和生产队斗私批修成果；二、开会方便，形式活泼；三、便于互帮互学，共同提高；四、有利于搞好家庭团结，建立新型家庭关系。
    新华社青岛十六日电  青岛市崂山县王哥庄公社港东大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部，积极响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，以家庭为单位开展斗私批修，使活学活用毛主席著作和革命大批判的群众运动更加广泛深入，毛泽东思想得到了空前的大传播，大普及和大运用，破私立公的斗争触及到每一个人的灵魂，人的精神面貌发生了根本变化，革命和生产形势一片大好。
    港东大队贫下中农和革命干部遵照毛主席关于农民“也要批判资产阶级”的教导，从今年八月就积极投入了革命的大批判运动。他们针对中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义谬论，在大队会上批，田头批，家庭里也批。大队干部发现家庭开批判会效果很好，就加以总结推广，并积极培养各家各户搞革命大批判的骨干。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的最新指示后，这个大队的贫下中农更进一步以“斗私，批修”为纲，在生产队和大队范围内开展大批判的同时，纷纷召开家庭斗私批修会。实践证明，这种家庭斗私批修会好处很多，是在农村深入开展革命大批判、普及毛泽东思想的好形式。它的好处主要有：
    一、能够巩固和发展大队和生产队斗私批修的成果，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。随着农村革命大批判日益深入，不少人头脑中的“私”字在公共场合失去市场，不敢露面了，但往往在家庭里还有存身之处。以家庭为单位开展斗私批修，就可以使“私”字无藏身之地，一心为公的思想得到大发扬。有的社员的私心在大队和生产队多次召开的斗私批修会上他都没有亮，当他在家庭斗私批修会上看到全家人都把“私”字打翻在地，进行彻底批判时，感到自己再不进步就要掉队，终于亮出了自己的“私”字，并且提高到两条道路斗争的高度来分析批判，更加坚定了走社会主义道路的决心。
    二、开会方便，利用吃饭、休息时间都可以开，形式活泼，效果很好。社员王瑞尧全家十一口人，在吃中午饭时就开了一个家庭批判会。在会上，母亲、大儿媳妇、小女儿都检查了自己在处理个人和集体关系上表现出来的私心杂念，最后大女儿作了总结。一家老小在吃一顿饭的时间内就开了一个会，过去在大队或生产队会上很少发言的人都发了言，大家觉得收获不小。
    三、便于互帮互学，共同提高。一家老小在一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起开忆苦会，吃忆苦饭，很快都提高了阶级觉悟。有些家庭里，有文化的青年以毛泽东思想为武器，把大家斗私批修的内容，加以总结提高，这样就更好地帮助全家人提高政治思想水平，更好地掌握毛泽东思想。
    四、以家庭为单位开展斗私批修，不但可以长期坚持，而且有利于解决家庭纠纷，搞好家庭团结，建立社会主义新型的家庭关系。社员刘瑞连有三个儿子，过去因为私字当头，各人只顾自己，长期互不说话，自从参加了家庭斗私批修会后，通过学习毛主席著作，开展斗私批修，全家在新的思想基础上达到了新的团结。由于家庭中的每一个成员都以毛泽东思想为统帅，互相开展批评和自我批评，这就进一步破除了过去遗留下来的族权、父权、夫权等封建残余观念，一种新型的家庭关系正在形成。
