The Tianjin Revolutionary Committee Establishment and Celebration Meeting's Telegram of Salutation to Chairman Mao

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 6th — The full text of the telegram of salutation to Chairman Mao from the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee Establishment and Celebration Meeting is as follows:

Most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao:

In the great situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses of Tianjin, with hearts full of excitement, report to you, our heart's reddest red sun, a piece of joyous news: the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee has been born in the storm of class struggle!

This is a new triumphant song of your invincible brilliant thoughts!

This is another great victory of your proletarian revolutionary line!

This is another great achievement created by the People's Liberation Army of China, which you personally founded, in the "three supports and two militaries" work!

Sunshine is everywhere, red flags are flying, and the drums are booming by the Bohai Sea. On this grand occasion, we cheer, we sing! Your great thoughts nurture us to grow, and the revolutionary path you open guides us to victory! Your kindness is higher than mountains and deeper than oceans. Our hearts are filled with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to you. The flowing Haihe River will never dry up, and the endless songs of praise will never end. With a thousand cheers and ten thousand songs, we sincerely wish you, our heart's reddest red sun, eternal life! Eternal life!

Respected Chairman Mao, it was your mighty hand that steered the Chinese revolution, personally formulating the operational strategy for the Pingjin Campaign. Under the direct command of your close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, the heroic People's Liberation Army of China liberated Tianjin in one fell swoop, giving this typical semi-feudal, semi-colonial old city a new life, and leading the suffering laboring people from darkness to light. On this unforgettable day, the revolutionary masses of Tianjin sang "The East Is Red" for the first time!

Respected Chairman Mao, it was you who, in 1958, during the Great Leap Forward, personally visited Tianjin, inspected factories, schools, and villages, and gave us extremely important instructions. Your teachings, your care, your majestic and solemn image, and your benevolent smile are deeply engraved in the hearts of the revolutionary people of Tianjin, inspiring us to advance leaps and bounds along the general line for socialist construction that you formulated!

Respected Chairman Mao, it was you who, in 1960, again came to Tianjin and celebrated the "May Day" International Labor Day with the four million people of Tianjin. This is the greatest encouragement and greatest honor you have given us, inspiring us to work hard and strive for strength. Respected Chairman Mao! We will forever be loyal to you! Even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, our hearts will not change. Even if the wind blows and the waves beat, our resolve will only grow stronger. We will forever follow you on the bright path to socialism and communism!

Respected Chairman Mao, it was you who, in 1963, when Tianjin was threatened by an unprecedented flood, personally issued the order to "definitely control the Haihe River." Your great battle call expressed the wishes of millions of people on both banks of the Haihe River, increasing our confidence in subduing the Haihe River and eliminating water disasters a hundredfold, mobilizing countless people, with the ambition to change the heavens and the earth, bravely fighting against nature!

Looking back at these moving scenes and these most happy moments, our hearts surge, and our blood boils. A million red hearts burst forth with a common voice: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

Respected Chairman Mao, it was you who personally initiated and led the world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, opening the road to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent capitalist restoration, and advance towards communism. You command hundreds of millions of people to form a mighty revolutionary army, launching a fierce attack on the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev. It was this Chinese Khrushchev who, soon after the liberation of Tianjin, rushed to Tianjin, desperately advocating "exploitation is meritorious" and whitewashing the capitalists, acting as a trumpet for capitalist restoration. Later, he repeatedly came to Tianjin to spread poison. The infamous "four clean-ups" and "true restoration" of the "Peach Garden Experience" were first thrown out in Tianjin. The Chinese Khrushchev also cultivated the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of Wan Xiaotang and Zhang Huai, as his agents in Tianjin. They frantically carried out anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought criminal activities, attempting to turn Tianjin into a black stronghold of capitalist restoration.

Respected Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary factions of Tianjin, following your battle cry, with the determination to defend you and your revolutionary line at the cost of our lives, united with deep hatred for a handful of capitalist roaders, raised high the banner of revolutionary rebellion is justified, and launched an attack on them, ringing their death knell.

The anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of Wan Xiaotang felt the end was near. They were panic-stricken and raged, trying to extinguish the revolutionary flames you had ignited. They surrounded and suppressed revolutionary masses, armed and repressed revolutionary youths; they plotted conspiracies, shot dark arrows, and launched a frenzied counterattack on revolutionary masses; they manipulated reactionary organizations, carried out counter-revolutionary seizures of power, creating white terror; they stretched out their black hands, stirred up trouble, diverted the main direction of the struggle, and resisted your great strategic deployment. In those days of rolling black clouds, the proletarian revolutionary factions underwent one severe test after another.

"The ship of the great ocean relies on the helmsman, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought."

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It was your four volumes of brilliant writings, your great thoughts, that showed us the direction and gave us boundless strength. It was you who led us through one rapid current and dangerous wave after another, overcoming one stormy wave after another, growing stronger in the storm of class struggle, and burning the revolutionary flames on both banks of the Haihe River brighter and brighter!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It was you, it was the Party Central Committee headed by you, who have always cared for us. At every critical moment, it was your wise decisions and great calls that dispelled the fog for us, inspiring us to forge ahead through thorns and thistles, charging into the fray in the complicated struggle!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You trust the masses the most, care for the masses the most, support the revolutionary movement of the masses the most, and know the hearts of the proletarian revolutionary factions the best. Facing cruel persecution, holding your revolutionary books, we gazed at Beijing day and night. You timely sent the heroic People's Liberation Army of China to fight side by side with us, launching a general attack on the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of Wan Xiaotang, and after fierce battles, finally smashed their strongholds, guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of Tianjin onto the course you indicated! Respected Chairman Mao! Without the People's Liberation Army of China that you personally founded, there would be no victory today, no everything. The unity of the army and the people is unbreakable; see who can defeat us?

Respected Chairman Mao, your inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, and your latest instructions, are the great guidelines for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The proletarian revolutionary factions of Tianjin, responding to the call, with the working class taking the lead, on all fronts, a surging tide, with "criticizing the self and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, quickly launched a high tide of revolutionary great unity, a high tide of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and a high tide of revolutionary great criticism. The revolutionary torrent rolls forward, and the situation is better than ever. Under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by you, the red power that the broad revolutionary masses of Tianjin have longed for day and night has been born!

Respected Chairman Mao! In the past eighteen months, you have led us through a magnificent battle course and achieved the greatest, greatest, greatest victory! All victories, ten thousand victories, all victories belong to the great leader Chairman Mao! In the joyous shouts of victory, we realize: the establishment of the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee is only the starting point of a new battle. Looking ahead, the future is bright and beautiful. Our mission is heavy and far-reaching, and we will never be arrogant or complacent. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, cleanse all the filth of the exploiting classes, and build Tianjin into a new world of your brilliant thoughts!

Respected Chairman Mao, we will definitely respond to your great call to "criticize the self and criticize revisionism," carry out a great revolution in the depths of our souls to eliminate private interests and establish public interests, thoroughly uproot the breeding ground of revisionism, and ensure that our country remains red for thousands of years! We will definitely carry out a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary great criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Tianjin, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity, consolidate and develop the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units. Let your great thoughts occupy all positions!

Respected Chairman Mao, we will definitely respond to your great call, seize the revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness, and do a better job in all aspects!

Respected Chairman Mao, we will definitely respond to your great call, carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement persistently and deeply. We will definitely learn from the People's Liberation Army, who guard the capital's gate and have made great contributions to the people, humbly, and strive to be models of supporting the army, and fight and win together with the PLA!

Respected Chairman Mao, we will definitely respond to your great call, rely on the masses, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidate the new revolutionary order, and build the newly born Tianjin into a fortress as solid as a rock and as strong as steel!

Respected Chairman Mao, it is you who have brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism to the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Your brilliant thoughts are the source of strength and the ocean of wisdom. Upholding the absolute authority of your brilliant thoughts is the fundamental guarantee of all our victories. We seize power relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and we must also rely on Mao Zedong Thought to hold and use power. We will forever and forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, and be your good soldiers. Let Tianjin become a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought, and let the great red banner of your brilliant thoughts fly high and forever in the sky of Tianjin!

"The four seas are in turmoil, and the winds and thunder are shaking the five continents." Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you who have led the world into a new era with your brilliant thoughts as the great banner. A movement to study your great works is flourishing internationally, and a new revolutionary storm is sweeping the globe. We are proud to live in the center of the world revolution and are extremely proud to fight under your banner. We not only want to be revolutionary factions at home but also revolutionary factions in the world. We will never forget the oppressed class brothers and sisters around the world, and we will wholeheartedly support their revolutionary struggles, letting your boundless great thoughts shine all over the world!

With the most sincere hearts, we wish you, the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, our heart's reddest red sun, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

    给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社天津六日电　天津市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会给毛主席的致敬电，全文如下：最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，天津市的无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众怀着万分激动的心情，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，报告一个胜利的喜讯：天津市革命委员会在阶级斗争的暴风雨中诞生了！
    这是您的战无不胜的光辉思想的一曲新凯歌！
    这是您的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    这是您亲手缔造的中国人民解放军在“三支”“两军”工作中创造的又一丰功伟绩！
    阳光普照，红旗招展，渤海之滨，锣鼓喧天。在这盛大的节日里，我们欢呼，我们歌唱！您的伟大的思想哺育我们成长，您开辟的革命航道引导我们走向胜利的前方！您的恩情高过山岳，深过海洋。我们心头充满着对您的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚！滔滔海河流不尽，曲曲颂歌唱不完。千声欢呼万声唱，最最衷心地祝愿您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    敬爱的毛主席，是您那掌握中国革命之舵的巨手，亲自制定了平津战役的作战方针。在您的亲密战友林彪同志直接指挥下，英雄的中国人民解放军，一举解放了天津，使这个典型的半封建半殖民地的旧城市获得了新生，使灾难深重的劳动人民从黑暗走向了光明。在这永生难忘的日子里，天津的革命群众第一次放声高歌《东方红》！
      敬爱的毛主席，是您，在一九五八年，在大跃进的年代，亲临天津，视察工厂、学校、农村，对我们做了极其重要的指示。您的教导，您的关怀，您的高大庄严的形象，您的慈祥的笑容，深深地铭刻在天津革命人民的心里，鼓舞着我们沿着您制定的建设社会主义总路线飞跃前进！
    敬爱的毛主席，是您，在一九六○年，又莅临天津，和天津四百万人民一起欢庆“五一”国际劳动节。这是您给我们的最大鼓舞，最大光荣！激励着我们鼓足干劲，奋发图强。敬爱的毛主席啊！我们永远忠于您！海枯石烂心不变，风吹浪打志益坚。我们永远跟着您，在社会主义—共产主义的光明大道上勇往直前！
    敬爱的毛主席，是您，在一九六三年，在天津受到罕见的洪水威胁的时候，亲自发出了“一定要根治海河”的动员令。您的伟大的战斗号召，表达了海河两岸千百万人民的心愿，百倍地增长了我们驯服海河、根绝水患的信念，调动了千军万马，怀着改天换地的雄心壮志，英勇地向大自然开战！
    回顾这些激动人心的情景，这些无比幸福的时刻，我们心潮汹涌，热血沸腾，千万颗红心迸发出一个共同的声音：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    敬爱的毛主席，是您，亲自发动和领导了震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，开辟了巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟、通向共产主义的道路。您统帅亿万人民，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，展开了猛攻。就是这个中国赫鲁晓夫，在天津解放不久，便一头扎到天津，拚命地宣扬“剥削有功”，为资本家涂脂抹粉，充当资本主义复辟的吹鼓手。此后，他又屡屡到天津放毒。臭名远扬的假四清、真复辟的“桃园经验”，就是首先在天津抛出来的。中国赫鲁晓夫还培植了万晓塘、张淮三反革命修正主义集团，做为他在天津的代理人。他们疯狂地进行反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，妄图把天津变成复辟资本主义的黑据点。
    敬爱的毛主席，天津市无产阶级革命派，紧跟您的战斗号令，怀着誓死保卫您，保卫您的革命路线的决心，凝集起对一小撮走资派的深仇大恨，高举革命造反有理的大旗，向他们发起了冲锋，敲响了他们的丧钟。
    万张反革命修正主义集团感到末日的来临，他们惊慌失措，暴跳如雷，妄图扑灭您所点燃的革命熊熊烈火。他们围剿革命群众，武装镇压革命小将；他们耍阴谋，放暗箭，对革命群众进行疯狂的反扑；他们操纵反动组织，实行反革命夺权，制造白色恐怖；他们伸出黑手，挑动事端，转移斗争大方向，抗拒您的伟大战略部署。在那乌云翻滚的日子里，无产阶级革命派经受了一次又一次的严峻考验。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您的雄文四卷，是您的伟大思想光辉，为我们指明方向，给我们无穷的力量。是您，带领我们闯过一个个急流险滩，战胜一道道惊涛骇浪，在阶级斗争的大风暴中越战越强，把海河两岸的革命烈火越烧越旺！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，是以您为首的党中央，一直关怀着我们。在每一个关键时刻，总是您的英明的决策，伟大的号召，为我们拨开了迷雾，鼓舞着我们披荆斩棘，在曲折复杂的斗争中，冲锋陷阵！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动，最最知道无产阶级革命派的心。我们面对着残酷的迫害，手捧您的革命宝书，日夜仰望北京城。您及时地派来了英雄的中国人民解放军，同我们并肩作战，向万张反革命修正主义集团发起总攻，经过剧烈的搏斗，终于摧垮了他们所盘踞的顽固堡垒，把天津市无产阶级文化大革命引上了您所指引的航程！敬爱的毛主席啊！没有您亲手缔造的中国人民解放军，便没有今天的胜利，没有我们的一切。军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？
    敬爱的毛主席，您视察华北、中南和华东地区，发出的最新指示，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大纲领。天津市无产阶级革命派闻风而动，工人阶级一马当先，条条战线万马奔腾，以“斗私，批修”为纲，迅速掀起了革命大联合的高潮，大办毛泽东思想学习班的高潮，革命大批判的高潮。革命洪流滚滚向前，形势空前大好。在以您为首的党中央的直接领导下，天津市广大革命群众日夜盼望的红色政权诞生了！
    敬爱的毛主席啊！十八个月来，您领导我们经过了波澜壮阔的战斗历程，取得了最大最大最大的胜利！千胜利，万胜利，一切胜利归功于伟大领袖毛主席！在庆祝胜利的欢呼声中，我们认识到：天津市革命委员会的成立，只是新的战斗的起点，展望未来，前途似锦，光明灿烂。我们任重道远，永不骄傲自满。我们决心更高举起您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，涤荡一切剥削阶级的污泥浊水，把天津市建设成您的光辉思想的新天地！
    敬爱的毛主席，我们一定响应您的“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，在灵魂深处开展破私立公的大革命，彻底铲除修正主义的温床，保证我们的江山千秋万代红！我们一定更加广泛深入地开展革命的大批判，把党内最大的一小撮走资派和他们在天津的代理人，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批臭，巩固和发展革命的大联合，巩固和发展革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改。让您的伟大思想占领一切阵地！
    敬爱的毛主席，我们一定响应您的伟大号召，抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好！
    敬爱的毛主席，我们一定响应您的伟大号召，把“拥军爱民”运动持久地深入地进行下去。我们一定要向守卫在首都门户，为人民屡建功勋的中国人民解放军虚心学习，争当拥军的模范，和解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    敬爱的毛主席，我们一定要响应您的伟大号召，依靠群众，大力加强无产阶级专政，巩固革命新秩序，把新生的天津建设成磐石一样巩固，钢铁一样坚强！
    敬爱的毛主席，是您，天才地、创造性地、全面地把马克思列宁主义发展到毛泽东思想的新阶段。您的光辉的思想，是力量的源泉，是智慧的海洋。大树特树您的光辉思想的绝对权威，是我们一切胜利的根本保证。我们夺权，靠的是毛泽东思想，掌权和用权也必须靠毛泽东思想。我们将永远永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。把天津市办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校，让您的光辉思想的伟大红旗，在天津市的上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，把世界引向了以您的光辉思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。一个学习您的伟大著作的运动正在国际上蓬勃展开，一场新的革命风暴正在席卷全球。我们以生活在世界革命的中心而感到荣耀，为战斗在您的旗帜下而无比自豪。我们不但要做国内的革命派，还要做世界革命派。我们永远不忘国际上一切受压迫的阶级弟兄，全力支援他们的革命斗争，让您的光焰无际的伟大思想，照遍全世界！
    最最衷心地祝愿您，全世界革命人民的伟大导师，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                    天津市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
                                    一九六七年十二月六日
