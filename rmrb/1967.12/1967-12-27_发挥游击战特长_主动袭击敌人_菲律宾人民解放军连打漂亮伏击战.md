The New People's Army of the Philippines, led by the Communist Party of the Philippines, has recently leveraged the strengths of guerrilla warfare to execute two successful ambushes, resulting in the deaths and injuries of twelve enemy personnel.

According to reports, the New People's Army, upon receiving intelligence that the enemy was planning an offensive, set up an ambush near a camp of the Philippine government's "security forces" in the province of Bulacan on the night of the 5th. They killed two and wounded two members of the "security forces." On November 30, they ambushed a patrol unit of the "security forces," killing six members of the "security forces" and two government officials on the spot.

The reactionary government of the Philippines has launched an offensive in an attempt to drive the New People's Army out of the forests. However, the New People's Army has proactively moved out of their strongholds, making it difficult for the enemy to locate them, while they can strike and ambush the enemy at will.
