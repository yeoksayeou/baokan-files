Our unit follows the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive that "military study classes should include soldiers." We organized a study class of Mao Zedong Thought where officers and soldiers study together. In just over twenty days of study, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao's latest directive is the greatest concern, care, trust, and encouragement for our army. Revolutionary soldiers have the reddest hearts, they are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They dedicate themselves to the revolution, do everything for the revolution, and have a heart that is forever red and follows Chairman Mao to continue the revolution. Officers and soldiers studying together has powerfully promoted the struggle against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism, and advanced the ideological revolutionization of officers.

Officers and soldiers studying together, exposing and struggling against selfishness, is a test for officers. In the study class, I had this experience: before exposing selfishness, I had many concerns. Before, when talking about thoughts with officers, we understood each other well, and there was no problem. But this time, it was with soldiers, should I open up my thoughts and expose all my selfishness, or should I expose small selfishness and not big selfishness, expose old selfishness and not new selfishness, expose selfishness that others know and not that others don't know? Would exposing my thoughts in front of soldiers lose my authority? In short, everything started from the "I." When these thoughts were still fiercely struggling within me, our exposure and struggle against selfishness began. The soldiers exposed their selfishness thoroughly, struggled against it resolutely, and dared to fight to the death. This spirit greatly educated me. A sentinel soldier, Tao Guoxing, who studied with us, said, "The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our mistakes?' I must firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call to 'struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism,' expose all my selfishness thoroughly, and seek everyone's help to better follow Chairman Mao in the revolution." He did not hesitate to expose all his selfishness, and other soldiers also eagerly exposed and struggled against their selfishness. The soldiers' actions educated me, inspired me, urged me, and touched my soul. I felt very ashamed and decided to humbly learn from the soldiers and forever be a student of the masses.

Under the help and promotion of the soldiers, I thoroughly exposed my selfishness of seeking comfort and lacking self-awareness of revolution, found the causes, dug out the roots, struggled against and criticized it fiercely, and decided to completely break with the "self."

This time, participating in the study class of Mao Zedong Thought where officers and soldiers study together, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao truly cares for us, cares for us again, protects us, protects us again, educates us, educates us again, and is patient, patient again. I decided to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively for life, study until old age, change until old age, follow until old age, and firmly establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought in the depths of my soul. I will forever be a student of the masses and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life.

　　以战士为师，加速思想革命化
　　驻沪空军某部作战科长　李书春
    我们部队遵循伟大领袖毛主席“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的最新教导，举办了干部、战士在一起学习的毛泽东思想学习班。在短短的二十多天学习中，我深深体会到，毛主席的这一最新指示是对我军的最大关怀、最大爱护、最大信任、最大鼓舞。革命战士心最红，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们一心为革命，一切为革命，有一颗紧跟毛主席永远干革命的最红最红的心。干部、战士在学习班里一起学习，有力地推动了斗私批修，促进了干部的思想革命化。
    干部、战士同学习，亮私、斗私，对干部是个考验。我在学习班里就有这样的体会：亮私心以前，我思想顾虑不少，以前和干部在一起谈思想，彼此都十分了解，没有什么。可这次是同战士在一起学，是敞开思想亮呢，还是亮小私不亮大私，亮远的不亮近的，亮别人知道的不亮别人不知道的呢？在战士面前敞开思想统统把“私”字亮出来，会不会失去“威信”？总之，一切都从我字出发。当着我的这些思想还在激烈地斗争着的时候，我们亮私、斗私会开始了。战士们亮私彻底，斗私坚决，敢于刺刀见红的精神，给了我极大的教育。和我们一起学习的警卫战士陶国兴说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”我要坚决响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，把私心彻底亮出来，取得大家的帮助，使自己更好地紧跟毛主席干革命。他毫不犹豫地把私心全部亮了出来，其他战士也争着亮私、斗私。战士们的行动，教育着我，启发着我，鞭策着我，触动了我的思想灵魂，我感到非常惭愧，决心虚心向战士学习，永远做群众的小学生。
    在战士的帮助和促进下，我彻底亮出了贪图安逸、缺乏自觉革命等私心，并且找了原因，挖了根，狠斗猛批，决心与“私”字彻底决裂。
    这次参加干部、战士同学习的毛泽东思想学习班学习，我深深体会到，毛主席对我们真是关心关心再关心，爱护爱护再爱护，教育教育再教育，耐心耐心再耐心。我决心一辈子活学活用毛主席著作，活到老，学到老，改到老，跟到老，在灵魂深处大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，永远做群众的小学生，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
