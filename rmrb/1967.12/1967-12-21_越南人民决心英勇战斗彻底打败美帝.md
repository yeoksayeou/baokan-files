The Vietnamese people resolve to fight bravely to defeat the U.S. imperialists completely

The National Liberation Front is the sole genuine representative of the South Vietnamese people, and the organizer and leader of the great victories of the South Vietnamese people

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 20th - Vietnamese newspapers published editorials on the 20th, warmly celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, expressing the resolve of the 31 million people of North and South Vietnam to fight bravely and defeat the American aggressors completely.

	The *People's Daily* in an editorial titled "The Victorious Banner of Heroic South Vietnam" said, the earth-shaking seven-year struggle of the southern compatriots has shown the invincible power of people's war and the inevitable victory of the anti-American, national salvation cause of the southern compatriots. The facts are clear: the most ferocious imperialism—the U.S. imperialism—has not only failed to subjugate the heroic Vietnamese nation but has been defeated by the Vietnamese nation and will inevitably suffer a complete defeat.

	The editorial emphasized that the National Liberation Front controls the situation in the South, is the sole genuine representative of the southern compatriots, the organizer of the great victories of the southern compatriots, and the leader of the southern compatriots who are defeating and will definitely defeat the American aggressors.

	In discussing the National Liberation Front's widespread support among the various ethnic groups and classes of the South, and its growing international prestige, the editorial pointed out that the entire progressive humanity stands on the side of our people, and acknowledges the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as the sole genuine representative of the South Vietnamese people. The American aggressors' distortions and slanders of the National Liberation Front can only further expose their stubborn attitude and show that they are trembling in fear before the prestige of the National Liberation Front.

	The editorial concluded by expressing that the military and civilians of the North are determined to implement the teachings of Chairman Hu: "The 17 million northern compatriots are determined to keep their pledge, to fight side by side with the 14 million southern compatriots, to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately unify the country."

	The *People's Army Daily* in an editorial titled "The South Will Certainly Achieve Complete Victory" said, the resolute 14 million southern compatriots, upholding the indomitable national tradition, are defeating and will definitely defeat the American aggressors. The southern compatriots have not only set a brilliant example in the will to decisively win, but also in the art of revolutionary struggle and in defeating the number one imperialism—the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

	The editorial said, the anti-American, national salvation cause of the Vietnamese people is achieving great victories. However, the long-term and arduous struggle of the entire Vietnamese people is also facing the most severe test. The U.S. imperialism is suffering a great defeat, but due to its stubborn nature, it will become even more frantic, adventurous, and brutal. Our military and civilians, with an iron will, upholding the spirit of "nothing is more precious than independence and freedom," will certainly complete our great cause in the current stage, and lead the anti-American war to a complete victory.

	The *Hanoi Capital Daily*, *New Era Daily*, *Labor Daily*, and *Unity Daily* also published editorials on the 20th, warmly celebrating the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

    新华社河内二十日电　越南各报二十日分别发表社论，热烈祝贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年，表示越南南北三千一百万人民，决心英勇战斗，彻底打败美国侵略者。
    《人民报》在题为《英雄的南方的胜利旗帜》的社论中说，南方同胞的惊天动地的七年战斗，表明人民战争的无敌力量和南方同胞的抗美救国事业的必定胜利。事实已经清楚地摆在人们的面前：穷凶极恶的头号帝国主义——美帝国主义，不仅不能使英雄的越南民族屈服，相反被越南民族所击败，并且必将遭到彻底的失败。
    社论强调说，民族解放阵线控制着南方局势，是南方同胞的唯一真正代表，是南方同胞的伟大胜利的组织者，是正在战胜美国侵略强盗和一定彻底战胜它的我国南方同胞的领导者。
    社论在谈到民族解放阵线受到南方各民族、各阶层人民的热烈拥护，国际威望日益提高时指出，整个进步人类都站在我国人民一边，都承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民唯一真正的代表。美国侵略者对民族解放阵线的歪曲污蔑，只能进一步暴露它的顽固态度，并表明它在民族解放阵线的威望面前心惊胆战。
    社论最后表示，北方军民决心实现胡主席的教导：“一千七百万北方同胞决心信守誓言，同一千四百万南方骨肉同胞并肩在一起，进行战斗，以解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国”。
    《人民军队报》在题为《南方一定获得全胜》的社论中说，坚强的一千四百万南方同胞，大力发扬民族的不屈传统，正在战胜并且一定会彻底战胜美国侵略强盗。南方同胞不仅在决战决胜意志方面树立了光辉的榜样，而且在革命斗争艺术方面和善于战胜头号帝国主义——美帝国主义侵略者方面树立了光辉的榜样。
    社论说，越南人民的抗美救国事业正在取得巨大的胜利。但是，全体越南人民的长期和艰苦抗战也正处在最严峻的考验时期。美帝国主义正在大败，但是由于它的顽固本性，它还会更加疯狂、冒险和残暴。我国军民本着钢铁般的决心，发扬“没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了”的精神，必定完成我们民族在目前阶段的伟大事业，把抗美战争引向彻底胜利。
    《首都河内报》、《新时代报》、《劳动报》和《统一报》二十日也分别发表社论，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年。
