Date: 1967-12-10
Edition: 5

As the invincible Mao Zedong Thought continues to spread widely throughout Latin America, a new Mao Zedong Thought study group has recently been established in Santiago, the capital of Chile.

The members of this study group have already begun their activities. They have expressed their strong desire to deeply study Mao Zedong Thought and to learn how to apply this great thought in practice. They unanimously believe that regardless of which country's people, as long as they oppose imperialism, reactionaries, and modern revisionism, they must learn to master and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Because Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is advancing towards global victory.

This study group will hold collective study sessions once a week. The study materials will include "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and other works by Chairman Mao.

    毛泽东思想在拉丁美洲广泛传播
    智利圣地亚哥建立毛泽东思想学习小组
    新华社九日讯　圣地亚哥消息：随着战无不胜的毛泽东思想在拉丁美洲日益广泛的传播，最近，又一个毛泽东思想学习小组在智利首都圣地亚哥建立。
    这个学习小组的成员已经开始活动，他们表示非常愿意深入学习毛泽东思想，并学会在实践中运用伟大的毛泽东思想。他们一致认为，不管哪一国人民，只要他们反对帝国主义、反动派和现代修正主义，他们就必须学会掌握和运用毛泽东思想，因为毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。
    这个学习小组将每周进行一次集体学习，学习内容有“老三篇”和毛主席的其他著作。
