Due to severe shortages of goods, Moscow's markets are currently experiencing serious panic buying. No matter which store you enter in Moscow, you will immediately see long lines of people rushing to buy consumer goods. In some large department stores, customers waiting to buy a shirt or sweater line up from the first floor all the way to the second or third floor. Stores have even deployed police to "maintain order." Near the Lenin Stadium, an open-air market, police use iron railings to enclose those rushing to buy goods to prevent people from cutting in line. Among the crowd, there are also many speculators. Someone witnessed a speculator from the countryside who bought six pairs of leather shoes in one go, intending to resell them in the more supply-strained countryside.

Due to the Soviet revisionist leadership's full-scale restoration of capitalism at home, the economy is in chaos, and market supplies are severely strained. They have no choice but to import large quantities of consumer goods from abroad to fill the market gap. Before the holidays, they released a batch of foreign goods onto the market, including sweaters from Japan and Belgium, shoes from Italy, coats from Finland, nylon shirts from Britain, and clothing from Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.

These foreign goods are extremely expensive. For example, a sweater from Belgium sells for sixty rubles, and a pair of Italian women's leather shoes sell for forty rubles. These foreign goods are obviously unaffordable for ordinary Soviet workers. It is unimaginable that a worker earning only a few dozen rubles a month would spend an entire month's salary on a British nylon shirt.

People in Moscow's state-owned department stores witnessed the following scene: An elderly woman approached the counter and pointed to a woolen scarf, asking, "How much?" The clerk softly replied, "Sixty rubles!" The old woman waved her hand and walked away. Another young man dressed as a worker stared at a British nylon shirt and asked, "How many rubles?" The reply was "Seventy rubles!" The young man shrugged and left. People also noticed that many products, after a slight change in packaging, had their prices significantly increased.

Although there are some items on display in the free markets and state-owned food stores, the prices are extremely high. For example, in the free market, pork sells for 2.5 to 3.5 rubles per kilogram, beef sells for 3 rubles per kilogram, cabbage sells for 30 kopecks per kilogram, cucumbers sell for 8 rubles per kilogram, tomatoes for 2 rubles, and apples for 1.5 rubles.

### 莫斯科供应困难抢购成风

    莫斯科供应困难抢购成风
    由于商品极其缺乏，目前莫斯科市场上出现了严重的抢购现象，无论你走进莫斯科市内的那一家商店，立刻就可看到一队队抢购消费品的“长蛇阵”。在一些大的百货商店里，为了买一件衬衣或一件毛衣，顾客一直沿着楼梯从一楼排到二楼或三楼。商店里还增派警察专门“维持秩序”。在列宁体育场附近的露天市场上，警察用铁栏杆把抢购物品的人们围起来，以防有人插队。人群中还混有不少投机商，有人亲眼看见一个从乡下来的投机商，一下就抢购了六双皮鞋，以便回到供应更为困难的乡村去倒卖。
    由于苏修领导集团在国内全面复辟资本主义，把经济搞得一片混乱，市场供应严重困难，他们只得从外国大量购买消费品以填补市场供应的不足。在节日前，他们在市场上又抛出了一批外国货，其中有日本、比利时的毛衣，意大利的皮鞋，芬兰的大衣，英国的尼龙衬衣……，还有南斯拉夫、波兰、保加利亚、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克等国的服装。
    这些外国货售价极高，例如，一件比利时的毛衣卖六十个卢布，一双意大利的女式皮鞋售价四十个卢布。这些外国货显然不是苏联普通的劳动人民所能买得起的。不能设想，目前一个每月工资只有几十个卢布的工人，会用一个月的工资去买一件英国的尼龙衬衣。
    人们在莫斯科“国营”百货商店里亲眼看见这样的情景：一个老太太走到柜台前，指着一条毛围巾问道：“多少钱？”店员低声地回答：“六十个卢布！”老太太把手一甩，回头就走。另一个工人打扮的青年人，对着一件英国的尼龙衬衣发楞，问道：“多少卢布？”回答说“七十卢布！”这个青年人耸了下肩膀，就走了。人们还发现，有很多商品稍微改了一下包装，价钱就比从前提高了许多。
    自由市场和“国营”食品店中虽然摆出了一点东西，但售价极高。例如自由市场里的猪肉每公斤卖两个半到三个半卢布，牛肉每公斤卖三个卢布，白菜一公斤卖三十个戈比，黄瓜每公斤高达八个卢布，西红柿——二个卢布，苹果——一个半卢布。
