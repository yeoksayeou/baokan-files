In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I received the most profound education and came to understand many things I had not understood before. The most important and fundamental thing is that I began to understand what Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line is and what the bourgeois reactionary line is. I understand that a true proletarian revolutionary must loyally uphold and defend Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. One must eliminate selfish thoughts, have the masses in mind, replace "fear" with "dare," replace self-reliance with reliance on the masses, and truly let "public" be the master, and let Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line be the master.

In the storms of mass struggle, smash the "self" and wash away the "fear."

This spring, Chairman Mao issued a call of great strategic significance: "The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad leftist masses." Our unit responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call and sent me to Beijing No. 89 Middle School for military training. As soon as I entered the school, selfish thoughts followed. I was afraid that staying away for a long time would affect my small unit's work; I was afraid of making mistakes and not being able to account for them upon return; I was afraid of saying the wrong thing and being held accountable. Once, a student asked me if their organization was leftist, if the general direction was correct, and if the PLA supported them. I thought this was a big issue and couldn't be casually answered. So, I refused him with "I don't know." Little did I know, the student scolded me, "Someone like you, who is always afraid, can you execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and support the leftist masses?" He finished speaking, turned around, and left. My face burned, and I was still a bit resentful. I thought: I, Ou Qingwei, grew up in hardship and grew up under the red flag. Chairman Mao is my great benefactor. I love Chairman Mao the most, and I love listening to Chairman Mao's words. How could it be said that I do not execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line?

At this time, the school launched activities to expose and denounce Liu Shaoqi's implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line, his attempt to usurp the country, the party, and restore capitalism. The revolutionary youngsters listed more than twenty crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, arousing my intense class hatred. At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings again: "You should care about state affairs and carry the Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" My heart was extremely excited. Chairman Mao wants us to care about state affairs, to care about the struggle between the two lines that decides China's fate and influences the future of humanity, but in my thoughts, I had not put it in, and in my work, I had not caught up. I was afraid of being "influenced," afraid of not being able to "account for it," but I was not afraid of losing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, not afraid of the danger of the socialist mountainside changing color. I realized: Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our lifeline. Losing it means losing the mountainside, losing our heads, and losing the future of humanity! Towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must be loyal to it, defend it, and this is the greatest loyalty to Chairman Mao. Breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness must be guided by the two lines.

Later, I studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Do not rely on old merits, but create new achievements." I further realized: being afraid of this and that, in essence, is only afraid of losing honor and old merits. Today, what hinders me from resolutely following Chairman Mao's words and the proletarian revolutionary line is this "fear." The root of "fear" is still "self." Only by cutting off "self" can "fear" be eliminated. I thought: Without Chairman Mao's teachings and the help of comrades, without fiercely fighting against the "self" in my head, how could I have the old merits of "five-good soldier," "model party member," and "active learner of Chairman Mao's works"? Today, I must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, go to the storms of mass struggle to fiercely fight against "self," to do well in military training, and to create new achievements.

Selflessness leads to great loyalty. The class I was responsible for, Class 2 of Grade 3, had just achieved revolutionary great unity, but a wind of denying the correct direction of military training and not wanting to conduct military training in school blew through society.

Some students in this class also thought: Great unity is "great compromise," and it should be "dissolved." Great unity faced the danger of collapse. I thought: Achieving revolutionary great unity is the revolutionary direction proposed by Chairman Mao. Insisting on and defending this direction is insisting on and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, which is the greatest loyalty. This is the time to test me. I cannot stand by and watch them mess around. I should arm them with Mao Zedong Thought and fight this wind to the end. Through investigation and analysis, it was found that in addition to the influence of society, the more important factor was the mountainism, windism, individualism, and petty-bourgeois factionalism in their minds. To consolidate revolutionary great unity and insist on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, it is necessary to fiercely fight against the "self" in the mind.

Where should we start? Chairman Mao has always taught us: "The vanguard and model role of Communist Party members is very important." To fight against selfishness with students, one must first fight against selfishness within oneself. Moreover, there are indeed some "self" in my mind that need to be exposed to the group for help in fighting against. Therefore, I exposed the fifteen manifestations of "self" in me since entering the school to all the students in the class, and fought against them fiercely. My method of exposing "self" was welcomed by the students. Many students excitedly said: "The deputy instructor is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, exposing thoughts without fear of embarrassment, what do we have to fear?" Others said: "The active learner of Chairman Mao's works exposed fifteen kinds of selfish thoughts, we should at least find dozens in ourselves." Thus, the whole class launched a wave of everyone exposing selfish thoughts, fighting against "self," and digging out the roots of selfishness. Many students who had never exposed their thoughts before now exposed their thoughts one after another in front of everyone. Through breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, we finally withstood this wind of wanting to "dissolve," further consolidated the class's revolutionary great unity, and my ideological transformation also progressed. From this, I tasted the sweetness of fighting against selfishness in the masses, realizing that daring to expose the "self" in the depths of one's soul to the masses has the deepest impact on one's soul and the greatest driving force for the masses; the more comrades supervise, the fiercer the fight against selfishness; the more selfishness is eliminated, the greater the loyalty to Chairman Mao. Later, I repeatedly exposed and fought against these fifteen kinds of selfish thoughts among students, teachers, and military training cadres, and consciously ensured that as soon as "self" showed any signs in my thoughts, I would expose and fight against it fiercely in the masses.

Only by completely eliminating "self" can one believe in and rely on the masses.

When I first entered the school, I did not understand or like many of the revolutionary youngsters' actions, thinking they were "illogical" and "disorganized and undisciplined." When the class was rectifying the Red Guards organization and selecting leaders, I was afraid they would not do it well, so I set a few rules. Who would have thought they would "rebel" and say I was issuing orders and setting frameworks, which was a substitute for their actions. I brought these problems to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Communist Party members in mass movements should be friends of the masses, not their superiors, and should be tireless teachers, not bureaucratic politicians." I realized that since entering the school, I had seen more of my own advantages and fewer of my own shortcomings; I had counted more of the students' mistakes and fewer of their achievements; I had believed more in myself and less in the masses' opinions, putting myself in the position of "managing" and "training," and reversing my position with the revolutionary youngsters. This was completely contrary to Chairman Mao's teaching that we should be "students of the masses." I thought: more of this, more of that, ultimately, the root of the problem is that there is too much "self" in the depths of the soul. If this "self" continues to expand, it will put oneself in opposition to the masses and become an obstacle to the mass movement. I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "making mistakes is inevitable, as long as one corrects them sincerely, it will be fine," and actively checked myself with the whole class, listening to their criticisms. The knots were untied, and they became more enthusiastic towards me.

The less "self" there is, the brighter the heart becomes. I thought, why did I think they were "illogical" and "disorganized and undisciplined"? It was because they touched the "self" in the depths of my soul. They were illogical towards this "self," and they had no organization or discipline towards this "self," which precisely showed that they were the most logical and the most organized and disciplined! I also realized more clearly: After more than a year of tempering and testing in the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary youngsters were indeed much more outstanding than me. I should resolutely learn from them.

One morning, I just walked into the classroom and saw a student carefully wiping the plaster statue of our great leader Chairman Mao. His reverent and serious expression, his concentrated work, even my entrance did not notice, how much he loved our great leader Chairman Mao! But in the past, I thought he was "naughty." What moved me the most was during the May 1st evening gala, more than ten students saw our greatest leader Chairman Mao. It was late at night, but they did not go home to rest and came to the school to report the great news to me: Chairman Mao is in extremely good health! They talked about their feelings, wrote in their diaries, and sang "The East Is Red" enthusiastically. I not only shared their happiness but was also inspired by their sincere love for our great leader Chairman Mao. I thought, why did I think this class was "backward" in the past? Why did I think these students were "naughty"? It was because my way of looking at problems was wrong. Chairman Mao said: "These comrades' way of looking at problems is wrong. They do not look at the essential and mainstream aspects of problems but emphasize non-essential and non-mainstream aspects." The revolutionary youngsters' unlimited love for Chairman Mao is the most reliable guarantee for our revolutionary cause to proceed to the end and for the Chinese and world revolution to proceed to the end. What is more important and precious than unlimited love for Chairman Mao? Whether one loves or opposes the great leader Chairman Mao is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution; it is the touchstone for distinguishing good comrades from bad elements. This is the decisive factor. We look at a person's essence and mainstream, which is to see if they love Chairman Mao, if they love Mao Zedong Thought, and if they love Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Although our class's revolutionary youngsters still have this or that shortcoming to overcome, their most essential thing is their unlimited love for Chairman Mao. The actions of the revolutionary youngsters made me feel the necessity of humbly learning from the masses and fighting against the "self" in the depths of the soul. Thus, I summarized the ten advantages of learning from the revolutionary youngsters and published them on a big-character poster. The students were greatly shocked, some said: "Others say our class is weak, but we didn't expect to have so many advantages!" Others said: "I have been in this class for more than three years, always hearing others talk about our shortcomings, but the PLA has learned ten advantages in just a few months." Someone else suggested: "The PLA has learned our advantages, but how many of the PLA's advantages have we learned?" Thus, the whole class discussed and summarized under the topic "What have we learned from the PLA?" and quickly launched a wave of learning from the PLA. The enthusiasm of the masses was aroused, and unity was strengthened. In late May, the class began to resume classes and make revolution, becoming the first class in Grade 3 to resume classes and make revolution.

Through this incident, I saw more clearly the essence and mainstream of this class, increased my confidence in doing well in military training work; at the same time, I also realized that only by overthrowing the "self" in my mind can I believe in and rely on the masses, and be a good student of the masses. How we treat the masses is not a matter of method, but a fundamental attitude towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a worldview issue.

Never leave the masses, and you will have the greatest revolutionary momentum.

When I first started teaching in Class 2 of Grade 3, there were always many students dozing off or making small movements during each class. At that time, I always thought this was a phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline, so I criticized those students who were dozing off, but the situation did not improve. Later, I went to the masses to seek opinions. A student said: "Your lectures are dull and uninteresting, we don't like to listen." I thought, I worked hard to give lectures, and you don't like to listen, but you should respect my labor! But when I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching us "Do not be afraid of criticism, the whole army will correctly understand the world and change the world in this process of criticism," I became sober. I asked myself, why did they not like to listen to the lectures I worked hard to give? Chairman Mao taught us: "Pay attention to every comrade in every link of work, do not let them leave the masses." Chairman Mao's teaching made me realize: The reason students doze off and make small movements during my lectures is that they are not satisfied with my lectures. This is a silent criticism and a wordless "protest," which shows that I have left the masses in my teaching. Therefore, I went to the students again to listen to criticisms and understand the situation. I found that they liked lively and vivid stories of heroes and models, and did not like dry and empty theories. I had not paid enough attention to this in my lectures. Chairman Mao said: "Those who do propaganda work have not investigated, studied, or analyzed their propaganda objects, and talk nonsense, which is absolutely not allowed." Later, when I was guiding the "Three Articles," I changed my previous teaching method. From the brilliant images of Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, and from the heroic deeds of comrades like Mai Xiande, I selected seven stories, combined with my own learning experiences, and integrated them into the three main viewpoints of the "Three Articles." This lecture lasted for three hours. My Mandarin is not good, but the students listened attentively, no one dozed off, and most of them took notes. When I sought opinions in the class, they happily told me: "You lectured very well, with practical examples, vivid and lively, not rigid at all." I thought, the masses' eyes are the brightest, their criticisms are not only the greatest political concern for me but also the mirror for me to understand and transform myself. Therefore, for any form of criticism from the masses, we must treat it with a high attitude, strictly demand of ourselves, and humbly be students of the masses. This made me gradually realize that only by seriously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, always being with the masses, most resolutely believing in and relying on the masses, can one have the greatest wisdom, the greatest strength, the best methods, and the highest enthusiasm, and can better create new achievements for the people.

    在群众斗争的大风大浪中斗私
    解放军海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表、副指导员　欧庆伟
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我受到了最深刻的教育，懂得了很多从前不懂得的道理。最重要、最根本的是开始懂得了什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线；懂得了真正的无产阶级革命战士，要忠诚地贯彻和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；要破除私心杂念，心里装着群众，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把相信自己换成相信群众，真正让“公”字当家，让毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线当家。
    在群众斗争的风雨中，打掉“私”字，冲掉“怕”字
    今年春天，毛主席发出具有伟大战略意义的号召：“人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。”我们部队坚决响应毛主席这一伟大号召，派我到北京第八十九中学搞军训。人刚进学校，私心杂念就跟着来了。我怕长期在外，影响自己小单位的工作；怕犯了错误回去不好交账；怕说错了话被揪住不放。一次，一位同学问我，他们那个组织是不是左派？大方向对不对？解放军支持不支持？我想，这是个大问题，不能乱说。就用“我不知道”拒绝了他。谁知道这位同学狠狠地“训”了我一句：“象你这样怕来怕去，能执行毛主席的革命路线，支持左派群众吗？”他说完一甩手就走了。我脸上火辣辣的，心里还有点不服气。我想：我欧庆伟在苦水里泡大，红旗下成长，毛主席就是我的救命大恩人，我最热爱毛主席，毛主席的话我最爱听，怎么能说我不执行毛主席的革命路线呢？
    这时，学校里开展揭发和控诉中国赫鲁晓夫推行资产阶级反动路线，妄想篡国、篡党、复辟资本主义的滔天罪行的活动。革命小将们摆出了资产阶级反动路线二十多条罪状，激起了我满腔的阶级仇恨。这时，我再学习毛主席的教导：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”心情无比激动。毛主席要我们关心国家大事，要我们关心决定中国命运、影响人类前途的两条路线斗争的大事，而我思想上却没有摆进去，工作上没有跟上来。我怕这个“受影响”，怕那个“交不了账”，唯独没有怕丢掉毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，没有怕社会主义的江山有改变颜色的危险。我体会到：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线就是我们的命根子。丢了它，就是丢了江山，丢了脑袋，丢了人类的前途！对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们要忠于它，捍卫它，这就是对毛主席的最大忠诚。破私立公必须以两条路线为纲。
    后来，我又学习了毛主席的最新指示：“不要吃老本，要立新功”，我更加认识到：这也怕，那也怕，说穿了只有一个怕，就是怕丢掉荣誉，怕失去老本。今天妨碍我坚决听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的就是这个“怕”字。“怕”字的根子还是一个“私”字，只有从“私”字上开刀，才能把“怕”字去掉。我想：没有毛主席的教导，没有同志们的帮助，不狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，我那有“五好标兵”、“模范党员”、“学习毛主席著作积极分子”这些老本？今天我只有坚决听毛主席的话，到群众斗争的大风雨中去狠狠斗“私”，才能搞好军训，才能立新功。
    无私才能大忠。我负责的三年级二班刚实现革命大联合，社会上就刮起一股否定军训大方向，不愿在校搞军训的风。
    这个班里也有人认为：大联合是“大凑合”，要“散摊”。大联合面临垮台的危险。我想：搞革命的大联合，是毛主席提出的革命斗争的大方向，坚持和捍卫这个大方向，就是坚持和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是最大的忠。这正是考验我的时候，我不能站在旁边看他们闹下去，我应该用毛泽东思想武装他们，同这股风斗到底。通过调查分析，发现除了社会上的影响外，更主要的是头脑里的山头主义、风头主义、个人主义以及小资产阶级派性作怪。要巩固革命的大联合，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，必须狠斗头脑里的“私”字。
    从那里斗起呢？毛主席一贯教导我们：“共产党员的先锋作用和模范作用是十分重要的。”要同学斗私，首先自己要斗私。而且自己脑子里也确有一些“私”需要亮出来请群众帮着斗。于是，我把进校以来“私”字在我身上的十几种表现，在全班同学中大亮特亮，大斗特斗。我这种亮“私”的作法，受到同学们的欢迎。许多同学激动地说：“副指导员是学习毛主席著作积极分子，亮思想不怕丑，我们还有什么可怕的。”还有的说：“学习毛主席著作积极分子还亮了十几种私心杂念，我们身上最少也得找出几十种。”于是，全班掀起了人人亮私心，斗“私”字，挖私根的热潮。许多过去从未亮过思想的同学，现在也一次再次地在大家面前亮思想了。通过破私立公，终于顶住了这股想“散摊”的歪风，进一步巩固了班级的革命大联合，自己的思想改造也前进了一步。从这里，我尝到了到群众中去斗私的甜头，体会到敢把自己灵魂深处的“私”字彻底亮给群众，对自己的灵魂的触动最深，对群众的推动最大；多一个同志监督，就多一分斗私的狠劲；多斗掉一分私心，就多一分对毛主席的忠诚。后来，我把这十几种私心杂念，在同学、老师中，在军训干部中，反复亮、反复斗，并且自觉做到只要思想上“私”字一露“芽”，就到群众中去狠亮猛斗。
    只有把“私”字彻底斗掉，才能相信群众，依靠群众
    刚进学校时，我对革命小将的许多举动不理解，看不惯，认为他们“不讲理”、“无组织无纪律”。班上整顿红卫兵组织选领导时，我怕他们搞不好，就规定了几条。谁知他们就起来“造反”了，说我下命令，划框框，是包办代替。我带着这些问题学习毛主席的教导：“共产党员在民众运动中，应该是民众的朋友，而不是民众的上司，是诲人不倦的教师，而不是官僚主义的政客。”我认识到进校以来，看自己的优点多，想自己的缺点少；数同学的错误多，摆同学的成绩少；相信自己多，听群众意见少，把自己摆到“管”和“训”的位置上去了，把自己同革命小将的位置弄颠倒了。这根本不符合毛主席要我们做“民众的学生”的教导。我想：这个多，那个多，归根到底，灵魂深处“私”字多。要是让这个“私”字继续膨胀起来，就会把自己摆到群众的对立面上去，成为群众运动的绊脚石。我反复学习了毛主席关于“犯错误是难免的，只要认真改了，就好了”的教导，主动向全班同学作了检查，并听取他们的批评。把疙瘩解开了，他们对我更加热情了。
    “私”字少一分，心里亮十分。我想，过去我为什么认为他们“不讲理”、“无组织无纪律”呢？就是他们触犯了自己灵魂深处的“私”字。他们对这个“私”字不讲理，对这个“私”字没有组织纪律，不正是说明他们是最讲理、最有组织纪律吗！我也更加认识到：经过一年多来文化大革命锻炼和考验的革命小将，确实比自己高明得多。我应该坚决向他们学习。
    一天早晨，我刚走进教室，就看到一位同学正细心地擦拭伟大领袖毛主席的石膏塑像。他那崇敬而又严肃的神情，专心致志的工作，连我进去也没有发现，他是多么热爱我们伟大领袖毛主席啊！可是过去，我却认为他“调皮”。最使我感动的是“五一”节晚会上，有十多位同学见到了我们最伟大的领袖毛主席。深夜了，他们也不回家休息，就到学校里来向我报告特大喜讯：毛主席他老人家身体非常非常健康！他们谈感想，记日记，纵情歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》。我不仅分享着他们的幸福，更受到他们这种对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的真挚感情的鼓舞。我想，为什么我过去感到这个班“落后”呢？为什么我认为这些同学“调皮”呢？是我看问题的方法不对。毛主席说：“这些同志看问题的方法不对。他们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西。”革命小将们无限热爱毛主席，我们革命事业就有了最可靠的接班人，把中国和世界革命进行到底就有了根本保证。有什么能比无限热爱毛主席更重要、更宝贵呢？对伟大领袖毛主席是热爱还是反对，是革命和反革命的分界线；是识别好同志还是坏家伙的试金石。这是决定性的东西。我们看一个人的本质和主流，就是要看他是不是热爱毛主席，是不是热爱毛泽东思想，是不是热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们班里的革命小将尽管还有这样那样的缺点需要克服，但他们最本质的东西，是无限热爱毛主席。革命小将的行动，使我更加感到虚心向群众学习，斗垮灵魂深处的“私”字的必要性。于是，我总结了学习到革命小将的十大优点，并把这十大优点用大字报公布出去。同学们看了震动很大，有的说：“人家都说我们班差劲，没想到我们还有这么多优点哩！”有的说：“我在这个班呆了三年多，老听到别人讲我们的缺点，解放军才来几个月就学到十大优点。”还有人提出：“我们的优点解放军学去了，解放军的优点我们学到了多少？”于是，全班以“向解放军学到了什么？”为题，进行讨论总结，很快掀起了一个向解放军学习的热潮。群众的积极性调动起来了，团结增强了。五月下旬，班里开始了复课闹革命，成为三年级七个班最早复课闹革命的一个班。
    通过这件事，我更加看清了这个班的本质和主流，增强了搞好军训工作的信心；同时也体会到，只有把自己头脑中的“私”字斗倒，才能相信和依靠群众，当好群众的小学生。我们怎样对待群众，不是一个方法问题，而是一个对待毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的根本态度问题，是一个世界观问题。
    一刻也不要脱离群众，就有革命的最大动力
    我开始到三年级二班上课，每堂课总有不少人打瞌睡，做小动作。当时，我总以为这是无组织无纪律现象，就批评那些打瞌睡的同学，但情况并没有好转。后来，我到群众中去征求意见。有个同学说：“你讲的课枯燥无味，我们不爱听。”我想，费了力讲课，你不爱听，也应该尊重我的劳动啊！但是一想到毛主席教导我们的“不要怕批评，全军在这种批评过程中，将会正确地认识世界，并改造世界”，我就清醒了。我想为什么自己讲不好课又要别人尊重我的劳动呢？这个“念头”虽小，危害很大。我狠斗了这一闪的私心杂念。我问自己，为什么费了力讲课，他们不爱听呢？毛主席教导我们：“注意每一个工作环节上的每一个同志，不要让他脱离群众。”毛主席的教导使我认识到：我讲的东西同学所以打瞌睡，做小动作，是因为他们对我讲的课不满意，这是无声的批评、无言的“抗议”，这说明我上课脱离了群众。于是，我再次到同学中去，听批评，摸情况。我发现他们最爱听生动活泼的英雄模范故事，不喜欢干巴巴的空道理。我在讲课时没有很好注意。毛主席说：“做宣传工作的人，对于自己的宣传对象没有调查，没有研究，没有分析，乱讲一顿，是万万不行的。”后来，我在辅导“老三篇”课时，改变了过去的讲课方法，从张思德、白求恩的光辉形象中，从麦贤得等同志的英雄模范事迹中选出七个故事，结合自己的学习体会，贯彻到“老三篇”的三个主要观点中去。这堂课讲了三个小时，我的普通话说得不好，但是同学们听得认真，没有人打瞌睡，而且大部分人记了笔记。我到班里征求意见时，他们高兴地对我说：“你讲得真好，有实际，有榜样，生动活泼，一点也不死板。”我想，群众的眼睛真是最亮，他们的批评，不仅是对我政治上的最大关怀，而且是我认识自己、改造自己的镜子。因此，对来自群众的任何形式的批评，我们都要高姿态对待，严格要求自己，虚心当群众的小学生。这使我逐渐认识到，只有认真地活学活用毛主席著作，永远和群众在一起，最坚决地相信和依靠群众，才能有最大的智慧，最大的力量，最好的办法，最高的干劲，才能更好地为人民立新功。
