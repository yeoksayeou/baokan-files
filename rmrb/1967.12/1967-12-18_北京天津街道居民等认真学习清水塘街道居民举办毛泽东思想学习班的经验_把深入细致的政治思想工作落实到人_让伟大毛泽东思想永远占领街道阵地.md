Residents of Beijing and Tianjin streets, along with street-level cadres, workers, students, and suburban farmers, are earnestly studying the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Qinghuatan Street, Changsha City. They unanimously expressed that they must learn this advanced experience and better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They will use "Fighting Selfishness and Criticizing Revisionism" as the guiding principle to establish and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, ensuring that the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is planted in every street of Beijing, and building the great capital into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Currently, the broad masses of residents and street-level cadres in Beijing are enthusiastically establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. When they saw the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Qinghuatan Street, Changsha City, they were overjoyed and held discussions. The street-level cadres and residents of Dongguanying Residents' Committee in Xicheng District said excitedly at a discussion meeting that the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Qinghuatan is very suitable for street residents. Following their experience, everyone can participate in the study, and everyone has the opportunity to be educated, spreading the great Mao Zedong Thought widely, and firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in the streets.

Since the Cultural Revolution, the residents' committee in this street has established a study group for Chairman Mao's works and recently started a Mao Zedong Thought study class, with over seventy residents participating. Some elderly women in their sixties and seventies actively participated in the Cultural Revolution after studying. After learning from the experience of Qinghuatan, the residents and street-level cadres in this street expressed with greater confidence that they would better respond to the great call of Chairman Mao, "You must care about state affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end," better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, drive out the "self," and thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi and the old Beijing Municipal Committee in the streets. Many street-level cadres also expressed that they would follow the teachings of Chairman Mao to serve the people wholeheartedly and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

The third session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class held in Shijia Hutong, Dazhalan, along with the students, instructors, street-level cadres, and police, compared their own issues with the experience of Qinghuatan and took measures to solve them. For example, for residents with many children, those who have already studied will help take care of the children during study time. For those who are busy with household chores and pay less attention to politics, they will do detailed ideological work individually. For those who cannot participate in the study class due to illness or old age, they will adopt a piece-wise responsibility system, with specific people responsible for delivering Mao Zedong Thought to their homes and helping them study at home.

Workers, Red Guards, and poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Beijing also expressed that the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Qinghuatan Street, Changsha City, is not only suitable for street residents but also very helpful for workers, peasants, and students. The revolutionary masses of the Beijing Water Supply Company excitedly said that this experience has set a good example for us to run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well. They believe that the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Qinghuatan Street is successful because it grasps the fundamental issue, that is, doing in-depth and detailed political and ideological work for every individual, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to study, and letting Mao Zedong Thought take root in people's hearts. They are determined to combine this with the specific situation of their unit, learn the good experience of Qinghuatan, and run the Mao Zedong Thought study classes even better. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Shunyi County, who are holding a three-level cadre meeting in Beijing, are seriously comparing their own situation with the three experiences of Qinghuatan, finding the gaps. Many people happily said that this experience is great, and we must take it back to our village, seriously study and promote it, and further run the Mao Zedong Thought study classes well.

The experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Qinghuatan Street, Changsha City, has drawn great attention from the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the broad masses of street residents, who have been greatly inspired and enlightened. Many street resident Mao Zedong Thought study classes that are currently being held immediately organized learning and discussion, and expressed that they would let this precious experience bloom and bear fruit among the broad masses of street residents in Tianjin.

The responsible person of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee said that the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Qinghuatan Street marks the great victory and further development of the Cultural Revolution. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological revolutionization of the people throughout the country." Tianjin is an industrial city with a large proportion of street residents. The struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the streets is also very intense. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party attempted to turn Tianjin into a bridgehead for restoring capitalism, and even this street-level battlefield was not spared, peddling a lot of black goods, with widespread poison. We should seriously study and promote the precious experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes in Qinghuatan Street, Changsha City, and immediately launch a new high tide of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the city. Arm the street resident masses with Mao Zedong Thought, use the method of comparing the old society with the new society and the two-line struggle to conduct class education, thoroughly settle accounts with Liu Shaoqi's attempt to restore capitalism and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and turn every street in the city into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The sixteen streets under the jurisdiction of Hongwei District in Tianjin have already universally held one session of a three-in-one Mao Zedong Thought study class with the participation of street resident group organization leaders, street residents' committee directors, and street-level cadres. Currently, the second and third sessions of street resident Mao Zedong Thought study classes are being held. Some street resident group organizations have spontaneously organized street resident Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to residential blocks or alleys. In each study class, a large number of fighters against selfishness and pioneers in criticizing revisionism have emerged, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. After the important experience of Changsha's Qinghuatan was published, the broad masses of street residents in Tianjin seriously studied and discussed it. Everyone expressed in the study that this experience is great, very timely, and very suitable for our needs. We must learn it and put it into practice. A director of a residents' committee in Dahu Tong Street, who is currently studying in the class, said, "The experience of Changsha's Qinghuatan, which shines with the light of Mao Zedong Thought, speaks to our hearts. The more we study, the more it suits our hearts. I will definitely pass on this experience to every household and every resident, so that more people can participate in the street resident Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought be planted everywhere."

    新华社十七日讯　北京市的广大街道居民、街道革命干部和工人、学生、郊区农民，认真学习长沙市清水塘街道居民举办毛泽东思想学习班的经验。他们一致表示，一定要把这个先进经验学到手，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办和办好毛泽东思想学习班，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍北京的每一条街道，把伟大的首都建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    首都广大街道居民和街道干部，目前正在兴起一个大办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮。他们看到长沙市清水塘街道居民举办毛泽东思想学习班的经验时，都高兴得不得了，纷纷学习座谈。西城区东冠英居民委员会的街道干部和居民，在座谈会上兴奋地说，清水塘举办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，太适合街道居民的特点了。按照他们的经验办事，就可以使得人人都能参加学习，人人都有受教育的机会，让伟大的毛泽东思想大普及、大传播，在街道上大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    从文化大革命以来，这个街道的居民委员会就成立了毛主席著作学习小组，最近又办起了毛泽东思想学习班，参加学习的居民有七十多人。有些六七十岁的老太太经过学习以后，也积极参加了文化大革命。这个街道的居民和街道干部学习了清水塘的经验以后，更加信心百倍地表示，一定要更好地响应伟大领袖毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，把“私”字扫地出门，把中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团在街道推行的反革命修正主义路线彻底批倒批臭。许多街道干部还表示，一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，全心全意为人民服务，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
    大栅栏施家胡同举办的第三期毛泽东思想学习班的学员、辅导员、街道干部和民警，对照清水塘的经验，检查了自己学习班存在的问题，并采取措施加以解决。譬如，对孩子多的居民，在学习时间内，由已经学习过的居民帮助她们带孩子。对于埋头家务、不大关心政治的居民，分头去做细致的思想工作。对于不能参加学习班的生病和年老体弱的人，采取分片包干的办法，由专人负责把毛泽东思想送上门，帮助他们在家里学习。
    首都的工人、红卫兵小将和郊区贫下中农也纷纷表示，长沙市清水塘街道举办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，不但适合于街道居民，对于工人、农民、学生也有很大帮助。北京市自来水公司的革命群众激动地说，这个经验为我们树立了一个办好毛泽东思想学习班的好样板。他们认为，清水塘街道毛泽东思想学习班办得好，是因为抓住了根本的问题，就是把深入细致的政治思想工作做到每个人，使每个人都能得到学习的机会，让毛泽东思想深入人心。他们决心结合本单位的具体情况，把清水塘的好经验学到手，把毛泽东思想学习班办得好上加好。正在举行三级干部会议的北京郊区顺义县贫下中农和革命干部，认真按照清水塘的三条经验，一条一条进行对照，找出差距。许多人高兴地说，这个经验太好了，我们一定要将它带回本村，认真学习、推广，进一步办好毛泽东思想学习班。
    新华社天津十七日电长沙市清水塘街道居民举办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，引起天津市革命委员会和广大街道居民的极大重视，他们从中受到了很大鼓舞和启发。很多正在开办的街道居民毛泽东思想学习班，立即组织学习和讨论，并且表示要让这一宝贵经验在天津市广大街道居民中迅速开花结果。
    天津市革命委员会负责人说，清水塘街道居民举办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，标志着无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利和进一步深入发展。正象我们伟大领袖毛主席英明指出的：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”天津市是一个工业城市，街道居民占很大比重。街道两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争也非常激烈。党内最大的走资派妄图把天津市变成复辟资本主义的桥头堡，就连街道这个阵地也不放过，兜售了许多黑货，流毒很广。我们应该认真学习和推广长沙市清水塘街道举办毛泽东思想学习班的宝贵经验，立即在全市街道掀起大办毛泽东思想学习班的新高潮。用毛泽东思想武装街道居民群众，用新旧社会和两条路线斗争回忆对比的方法，进行阶级教育，彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义、颠覆无产阶级专政的滔天罪行，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，把全市街道都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    天津市红卫区所属的十六条街，已经普遍举办了一期有街道居民群众组织负责人、街道居民委员会主任和街道干部参加的三结合的毛泽东思想学习班，目前正在开办第二、三期街道居民毛泽东思想学习班。有些街道居民群众组织还自发地按照居民居住片或胡同，组织了街道居民毛泽东思想学习班。各个学习班里，涌现出大批斗私尖兵和批修闯将，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。长沙市清水塘的重要经验发表以后，天津市广大街道居民认真学习、讨论。大家在学习中一致表示，这个经验太好了，太适时了，很切合我们的需要，我们一定把它学到手，并贯彻到实际行动中去。正在学习班学习的大胡同街一位居民委员会主任说，闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的长沙市清水塘的经验，字字句句都说到了我们心坎儿上，越学越合我们的心意，我一定把这个经验传到各家各户，传给每个居民，让更多的人都来参加街道居民毛泽东思想学习班，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍每一寸土地。
