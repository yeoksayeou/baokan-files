The Chinese Khrushchev has been vigorously promoting a revisionist labor line, opposing the transformation of the trade unions into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and attempting to strip the labor movement of its political soul, erase the class nature of the unions, and turn them into a big mix of class collaboration, becoming a tool for his restoration of capitalism. His intentions are extremely malicious.

The Chinese Khrushchev has been vigorously opposing Chairman Mao's great theory that class and class struggle exist in socialist society. In the early days of liberation, he maliciously proposed that "as long as they are salaried workers, regardless of their beliefs, they can all join the union." After the basic completion of the three major transformations, he advocated that "after the abolition of capitalists' interest, have the classes been transformed? These people are mixed in the union, one red for ten blacks." During the Four Clean-ups movement, he further proposed that "reformed" landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements "can also join the union," and so on. In short, this number one labor traitor has been racking his brains to turn the revolutionary mass organization of the working class into an all-inclusive "all-people's union."

Under the influence of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist labor line, some capitalists, bosses, feudal foremen, and even Kuomintang spies in our factory have all successively joined the union. A shoe workshop owner who exploited us workers for more than twenty years also joined the union. This guy, after "retiring," still used the pretext of being an "old worker" to cause trouble in the alley. This is the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's "all-people's union." The Chinese Khrushchev's "all-people's union," when exposed, is nothing but stuffing social dregs into the ranks of the working class, disrupting our class lines, and peacefully transforming the revolutionary mass organization of the working class into a revisionist big mix, organizing forces for his restoration of capitalism in China. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings on "the union is a mass organization of the working class" and thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist labor line, thoroughly eliminating his poison.

    批臭“全民工会”
    上海工总司第五皮鞋厂造反队员　李元海
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力推行修正主义的工运路线，反对把工会办成毛泽东思想的大学校，妄图抽掉工人运动的政治灵魂，抹煞工会的阶级性，把工会搞成一个阶级合作的大杂烩，成为他复辟资本主义的工具。其用心十分恶毒。
    中国赫鲁晓夫竭力反对毛主席关于社会主义社会存在着阶级、阶级斗争的伟大理论。在解放初期，他就别有用心地提出“只要是工薪劳动者，不分信仰，都可加入工会”；在三大改造基本完成以后，他又鼓吹“资本家定息取消后，是不是阶级就化过来了，这些人搞在工会中，十红夹一黑”；在四清运动中，他进一步提出“改造好”的地富反坏，“也可以加入工会”等等。总之，这个头号大工贼挖空心思要把工人阶级的革命的群众组织变为无所不包的“全民工会”。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫这条修正主义工运路线的影响下，我厂一些资本家、老板娘、封建把头，以至国民党特务等，都相继加入了工会。有一个剥削了我们工人二十多年的皮鞋作场老板，也加入了工会，这个家伙在“退休”以后，还以“老工人”为幌子，在里弄内为非作歹。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫“全民工会”的流毒。中国赫鲁晓夫的“全民工会”，拆穿了来看，就是把社会渣滓塞到工人阶级队伍中来，搅乱我们的阶级阵线，把工人阶级的革命群众组织和平演变为修正主义的大杂烩，为他在中国复辟资本主义组织力量。我们一定要遵循毛主席关于“工会是工人阶级的群众组织”的教导，彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义工运路线，彻底肃清他的流毒。
