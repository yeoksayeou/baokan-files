With the assistance of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, the entire factory's atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works has become increasingly intense, relationships among the masses have become closer, and both revolution and production are flourishing.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 13th: The two revolutionary mass organizations at Guangzhou First Cotton Mill, with the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, have taken "Criticize the Self and Oppose Revisionism" as the guiding principle. They have focused on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, starting from class education and the struggle between the two lines. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, they have launched the "One Helps One, One Becomes Red" activity, which has further eliminated misunderstandings among the revolutionary workers in the factory, strengthened unity, and consolidated and developed revolutionary unity from a ideological standpoint.

In October, Guangzhou First Cotton Mill achieved organizational unity, but the antagonistic sentiments between the two revolutionary mass organizations had not been completely eliminated. The People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the factory, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, realized that to further consolidate revolutionary unity from an ideological standpoint, deep and thorough ideological work must be done, and the masses must be mobilized to do this work, not just rely on a few individuals. Therefore, they introduced the experience of the army's "One Helps One, One Becomes Red" activity to the two revolutionary mass organizations and suggested that they launch this mass activity in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes jointly held by the two revolutionary mass organizations, with "Criticize the Self and Oppose Revisionism" as the guiding principle. Starting from mid-November, after three sessions of study classes, it was proven that this is a good method for the masses to educate and liberate themselves.

How can people with different viewpoints form "One Helps One, One Becomes Red" pairs? Initially, the leaders of the study classes deliberately organized pairs of people who had strong antagonistic sentiments. However, the activity did not take off. When the two opposing sides met, some sat in silence, while others prepared to argue. In this situation, the leaders of the study classes, together with the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, studied Chairman Mao's instructions, analyzed, and researched. Chairman Mao taught: "Due to the correct conduct of the bitterness (bitterness of the old society and the oppression of the reactionaries on the laboring people) and the three examinations (examine class, examine work, examine fighting spirit) movement, the awareness of the entire army's officers and soldiers to fight for the liberation of the oppressed laboring masses, for the land reform of the entire country, and for the annihilation of the enemy of the people, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, has been greatly enhanced; at the same time, the firm unity of the entire army under the leadership of the Communist Party has been greatly strengthened." Everyone felt that to make people with different viewpoints willingly form pairs and truly launch the "One Becomes Red" activity, it is necessary to focus on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, strengthen class education, and education on the struggle between the two lines. Therefore, they conducted class education on recalling bitterness and sweetness and education on the struggle between the two lines in the study classes, and held multiple bitterness meetings, organizing everyone to recount the bitterness of the old society and the bitterness of suffering persecution from the bourgeois reactionary line. As a result, the class consciousness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines of the revolutionary masses were greatly enhanced. Everyone realized that in the past, we were all bitter gourds from the same vine, suffering the same oppression and exploitation from imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and the landlord class; now, we are all masters of the country. At this time, the study class organized everyone to further study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two large organizations that are irreconcilable." After studying, everyone had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions. They said that the working class listens to Chairman Mao the most, and we should, under the leadership of the great teacher Chairman Mao, attack the common enemy and advance towards the common revolutionary goal. There is no reason not to further consolidate and develop revolutionary unity.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions, when grasped by the masses, produce boundless power. From then on, the "One Becomes Red" activity in the study classes became lively. Many pairs exchanged hearts, using proletarian party spirit to strictly demand of themselves, actively making self-criticisms, and resolving ideological knots. Originally, some students in the study class who had strong antagonistic sentiments voluntarily requested to form "One Helps One, One Becomes Red" pairs, quickly eliminating misunderstandings and uniting better to jointly carry out the great criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their unit. Many comrades excitedly said: In the past, the bourgeois reactionary line separated us; now, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has united us tightly together again.

The launch of the "One Becomes Red" activity has greatly improved the masses' class consciousness, awareness of the struggle between the two lines, and political and ideological levels, truly consolidating and developing revolutionary unity from an ideological standpoint. Those who have already formed "One Becomes Red" pairs not only continue to strive to consolidate their pairs but also enthusiastically act as matchmakers, helping others form pairs, determined to see more "One Becomes Red" pairs emerge, making the entire factory become "all red." Now, the "One Becomes Red" activity in this factory has been promoted from the study classes to the workshops. There are more and more "One Becomes Red" pairs, the atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works is becoming more intense, relationships among the masses are becoming closer, and in both revolution and production, a flourishing scene is presented.

### 从阶级教育入手进一步从思想上巩固发展革命大联合　广州第一棉纺厂开展“一对红”活动

　　从阶级教育入手进一步从思想上巩固发展革命大联合
　　广州第一棉纺厂开展“一对红”活动
    在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，全厂学习毛主席著作的气氛越来越浓，群众之间的关系越来越密切，革命和生产都呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象
    新华社广州十三日电  广州第一棉纺厂两大革命群众组织，在驻厂人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓对毛主席最新指示的学习，从阶级教育和两条路线斗争教育入手，在毛泽东思想学习班里开展“一帮一、一对红”活动，使全厂革命职工进一步消除隔阂，加强团结，从思想上巩固和发展了革命大联合。
    第一棉纺厂在十月份实现了组织上的大联合，但是两大革命群众组织之间的对立情绪并没有完全消除。人民解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队根据伟大领袖毛主席的教导，认识到要从思想上进一步巩固革命大联合，必须做深入细致的思想工作，并且放手发动群众来做，不能只依靠少数人。于是，他们向两大革命群众组织介绍部队开展“一帮一、一对红”活动的经验，建议他们在两大革命群众组织联合举办的毛泽东思想学习班里，以“斗私，批修”为纲，开展这个群众性的活动。从十一月中旬开始，经过三期学习班的实践，证明这是群众自己教育自己、自己解放自己的好办法。
    怎样才能让不同观点的人结成“一帮一、一对红”的“对子”？起初，学习班的领导有意识地组织平时对立情绪比较大的同志结成“对子”，但是活动不起来。两个对立面碰在一起，有的相对“静坐”，有的准备顶嘴。在这种情况下，学习班的领导又跟毛泽东思想宣传队一起学习毛主席的指示，进行分析、研究。毛主席教导说：“由于诉苦（诉旧社会和反动派所给予劳动人民之苦）和三查（查阶级、查工作、查斗志）运动的正确进行，大大提高了全军指战员为解放被剥削的劳动大众，为全国的土地改革，为消灭人民公敌蒋介石匪帮而战的觉悟性；同时就大大加强了全体指战员在共产党领导之下的坚强的团结。”大家认为，要使不同观点的同志自愿地结成“对子”，并且把“一对红”活动真正开展起来，就必须狠抓对毛主席最新指示的学习，加强阶级教育和两条路线斗争的教育。于是，他们就在学习班里进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育和两条路线斗争的教育，并且多次召开诉苦会，组织大家诉旧社会的苦，诉遭受资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦。这样做的结果，大大提高了革命群众的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟。大家认识到，过去我们都是同一条苦藤结的瓜，同样受帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和地主阶级的压迫、剥削；如今，我们都是国家的主人。这个时候，学习班又组织大家进一步学习毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”经过学习，大家对毛主席的指示体会得就更加深刻了。他们说，工人阶级最听毛主席的话，我们应该在伟大导师毛主席的领导下，向共同的敌人进攻，向共同的革命目标前进，没有任何理由不进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合。
    毛主席的最新指示为群众所掌握，就产生了无穷的威力。从此以后，学习班里的“一对红”活动活跃起来了。许多“对子”互相交心，用无产阶级党性严格要求自己，主动作自我批评，相互解开思想上的疙瘩。原来在学习班里一些对立情绪比较厉害的学员，自觉地要求结成“一帮一、一对红”的“对子”，迅速消除隔阂，更好地联合起来，共同搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。许多同志激动地说：过去，资产阶级反动路线把我们分开；现在，毛主席的革命路线又把我们紧紧地联在一起了。
      “一对红”活动的展开，使群众的阶级觉悟、两条路线斗争的觉悟和政治思想水平都有了很大提高，真正从思想上巩固和发展了革命的大联合。已经结成“一对红”的同志，不仅继续努力巩固自己的“对子”，而且还热情地穿针引线，帮助别人结成“对子”，决心让更多的“一对红”出现，使全厂变成“一片红”。现在，这个厂“一对红”的活动已从学习班推广到车间，“一对红”的“对子”越来越多，学习毛主席著作的气氛越来越浓，群众之间的关系越来越密切，在革命和生产上，都呈现出一片欣欣向荣的景象。
