The telegram of congratulations from our great leader Chairman Mao to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho is a brilliant historical document with immense practical and profound historical significance. It is like a beacon, illuminating the path to victory for the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people around the world.

In the telegram, Chairman Mao clearly states: "Your victory once again demonstrates that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly relied upon, and a people's war is waged, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

Chairman Mao's assertion is a scientific summary of the experiences of revolutionary struggles in various countries.

More than thirty years ago, the great leader Chairman Mao personally led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, which, under extremely difficult conditions, crushed the Nationalist reactionaries' repeated counter-revolutionary "encirclements and suppressions." This allowed the revolutionary forces to grow significantly and establish one red base area after another. How was this achieved? Through people's war!

More than twenty years ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, after eight years of arduous struggle, defeated the seemingly powerful Japanese imperialism that sought to annihilate China and annex Asia. How was this achieved? Through people's war!

After the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people, in just over three years, defeated the eight million Nationalist troops, armed to the teeth and directly supported by American imperialism, achieving a great victory for the Chinese revolution. How was this achieved? Through people's war!

The long-term practice of the Chinese revolution has convincingly proven: as long as the people are firmly relied upon and a people's war is waged, there is no battle that cannot be won.

All opportunists and revisionists fear imperialism, fear war, and fear revolution. Therefore, they fiercely oppose people's war, maliciously slander people's war, and secretly or openly engage in evil activities to sabotage people's war.

They even absurdly claim that a large country like China can wage a people's war, but small countries cannot.

The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people has given them a resounding slap in the face. In South Vietnam, fourteen million people on seventeen thousand square kilometers of land have been fighting against more than one hundred thousand American and puppet troops, driving them to a desperate and chaotic state. This fully demonstrates the boundless power of people's war.

Chairman Mao teaches: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." Chairman Mao also says: "From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." The great victory of the Vietnamese people in their war against American aggression and for national salvation once again proves this truth. Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and theories on people's war represent a new epoch in the development of Marxism-Leninism, serving as a great treasure for guiding the world's revolutionary people in their struggle for liberation and the overthrow of all demons and monsters.

We, the revolutionary proletarians, enthusiastically hail the telegram of congratulations from our great leader Chairman Mao to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho. We firmly support and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions. We wholeheartedly praise people's war and firmly support the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people around the world in waging people's war. We must further strive to learn Chairman Mao's theories on people's war, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, carry out the revolution, and prepare for war, ready at any moment to use people's war to confront any enemy that dares to invade. If American imperialism, in its desperation, dares to impose war on the Chinese people, then the seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will surely drown them in the vast ocean of people's war!

    我们的伟大领袖毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电，是一篇光辉的历史文献，具有极其伟大的现实意义和深远的历史意义。它象一盏光芒四射的灯塔，照亮了越南人民和全世界革命人民走向胜利的战斗道路。
    毛主席在贺电中明确地指出：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    毛主席的这个论断，是对各国人民革命斗争经验的科学总结。
    三十多年前，伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导的中国工农红军，在极端困难的条件下，粉碎了国民党反动派一次又一次的反革命“围剿”，使革命力量得到了很大的发展，建立了一片又一片的红色根据地。靠什么？靠人民战争！
    二十多年前，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，经过八年艰苦卓绝的斗争，打败了企图灭亡中国、吞并亚洲的貌似强大的日本帝国主义。靠什么？靠人民战争！
    在抗日战争胜利后，中国人民又仅仅以三年多的时间，打败了美帝国主义直接支持的、武装到牙齿的八百万国民党军队，取得了中国革命的伟大胜利。靠什么？靠人民战争！
    中国革命的长期实践，雄辩地证明：坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，就无往而不胜。
    一切机会主义者、修正主义者，都害怕帝国主义，害怕战争，害怕革命。因而他们拚命地反对人民战争，疯狂地诋毁人民战争，到处明里暗里进行破坏人民战争的罪恶勾当。
    他们还胡说什么象中国这样的大国可以进行人民战争，小国则不能进行人民战争。
    越南人民的英勇斗争，给了他们一记最响亮的耳光。越南南方一千四百万人民，在十七万平方公里的土地上，抗击着一百多万美伪军，把他们打得走投无路，狼狈不堪。这充分显示了人民战争的无穷威力。
    毛主席教导说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”毛主席还说：“从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，又一次证明了这个真理。毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想、理论，是对马克思列宁主义学说的划时代的新发展，是指导世界革命人民翻身解放、打倒一切妖魔鬼怪的伟大法宝。
    我们无产阶级革命派最最热烈地欢呼伟大领袖毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电，对毛主席的指示坚决拥护，坚决照办。我们最热烈地歌颂人民战争，最坚决地支持越南人民和全世界一切革命人民进行人民战争。我们一定要进一步努力学习毛主席关于人民战争的理论，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，百倍提高警惕，抓革命，促战备，随时准备用人民战争对付敢于来犯的任何敌人。如果美帝国主义狗急跳墙，敢于把战争强加给中国人民，那么，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，就一定要把他们淹没在人民战争的汪洋大海之中！
