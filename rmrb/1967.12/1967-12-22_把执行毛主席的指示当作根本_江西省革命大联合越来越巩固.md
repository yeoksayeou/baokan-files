The Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Great Alliance Preparatory Committee, with the working class as its core and main force, has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. By using Chairman Mao's latest instructions to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses, it has continuously promoted and solidified the revolutionary great alliance of the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses throughout the province. Currently, six prefectures and more than 90% of the counties and cities in the province have achieved revolutionary great alliances. The vast majority of revolutionary mass organizations in these regions have joined the provincial "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee."

After Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China were issued, the provincial "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" fully mobilized the masses to study and resolutely implement them. This further solidified the revolutionary great alliance in terms of ideology and politics, and developed the revolutionary great alliance in terms of organization. It formed a vast cultural revolution army, making the revolution and production even better, and achieving one victory after another.

The Jiangxi Provincial "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" was established in the midst of fierce struggles between the two lines as the basic unified organization of the revolutionary cadres throughout the province. They raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully carried forward the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, and made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the province. They listened most to Chairman Mao's words and acted most in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. They resolutely opposed petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthened proletarian party spirit, and consistently advocated for revolutionary great alliances from the bottom up by industry, system, and class. At the same time, they correctly treated the deceived masses, actively helped them return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and absorbed them into their organization, developing the revolutionary great alliance. Recently, to adapt to the needs of the revolutionary situation, the provincial "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" adjusted the original eight departments into four departments: workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and educational and cultural systems. They streamlined the organization, strengthened the leadership, and became an even stronger organization for the united struggle of the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses throughout the province.

The Jiangxi Provincial "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" regards the resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the fundamental principle for solidifying the revolutionary great alliance. They spared no effort to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary cadres throughout the province and mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline. They thoroughly criticized petty-bourgeois factionalism. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and the bourgeois reactionary line," the "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" acted swiftly and decisively. They organized extensive and in-depth study and propaganda, launching a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the same time, the provincial "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" and its affiliated organizations carried out rectification and study activities. They brought their living thoughts to the study and application of Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as the "Old Five Articles," seriously criticized and repudiated revisionism, and from the ideological level, powerfully promoted and solidified the revolutionary great alliance.

Within and outside the "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" organization, a small number of old rebels made various mistakes, and some even made serious mistakes. The Jiangxi Provincial "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" believed that these old rebels, despite making various mistakes, were still internal contradictions among the people and should be handled according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said, "Different kinds of contradictions can only be resolved by different kinds of methods." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the provincial "Great Alliance Preparatory Committee" did not adopt an attitude of applying pressure or absolute exclusion towards the old rebels who made mistakes. Instead, they patiently helped, sincerely criticized, and warmly united. The focus of their struggle was always on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed. They took "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, starting from education, and conducted a large amount of detailed ideological and political work on the old rebels who made mistakes. This helped them quickly raise their awareness and consciousness, further solidifying and developing the revolutionary great alliance.

    把执行毛主席的指示当作根本  江西省革命大联合越来越巩固
    据新华社南昌二十一日电　以工人阶级为核心和主力军的江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛主席的最新指示宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，不断地促进和巩固了全省广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众的革命大联合。现在，全省六个专区和百分之九十以上的县、市，已经实现了革命的大联合，这些地区绝大部分的革命群众组织参加了省“大联筹”。
    毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的重要指示下达后，省“大联筹”充分发动群众认真学习，坚决执行，又从思想上和政治上进一步巩固了革命的大联合，从组织上进一步发展了革命的大联合，结成浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，把革命和生产搞得好上加好，夺取了一个又一个胜利。
    江西省“大联筹”是在两条路线激烈斗争中建立起来的全省基本统一的无产阶级革命派组织。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，充分发扬革命造反精神，为全省无产阶级文化大革命建立了丰功伟绩。他们最听毛主席的话，最照毛主席的指示办事，坚决反对小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，一贯坚持按行业、按系统、按班级实行自下而上的革命大联合，同时正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，积极帮助他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，吸收他们参加自己的组织，发展革命的大联合。最近，省“大联筹”为适应革命形势发展的需要，把原来所属的八个口，调整为工人、贫下中农、红卫兵和文教系统四个口，精简机构，增强领导，更加成为全省无产阶级革命派和革命群众团结战斗的坚强组织。
    江西省“大联筹”把坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，作为巩固革命大联合的根本。他们尽一切力量向全省无产阶级革命派宣传毛主席的最新指示，并且发动广大革命群众，以毛主席的最新指示为指针，大破小资产阶级的派性。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，“大联筹”闻风而动，雷厉风行，广泛深入地组织大学习、大宣传，掀起了活学活用毛主席最新指示的高潮。与此同时，省“大联筹”及所属组织开展了整风学习活动，带着活思想，活学活用毛主席的“老五篇”等光辉著作，认真斗私批修，从思想上有力地促进和巩固了革命的大联合。
    在“大联筹”组织内外，曾有一小部分老造反派犯了这样那样的错误，有的甚至犯了较严重的错误。江西省“大联筹”认为，这部分老造反派尽管犯有这样那样的错误，但还是人民内部矛盾，应当照毛主席的教导办事。毛主席说：“不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”遵照毛主席的这一教导，省“大联筹”对待犯了错误的老造反派，不是采取施加压力、绝对排斥的态度，而是耐心帮助，诚恳批评，热情联合，斗争锋芒始终对准党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，从教育入手，对犯错误的老造反派进行了大量细致的思想政治工作，帮助他们迅速提高了认识和觉悟，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合。
