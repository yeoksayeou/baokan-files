An Indian youth worker saw a tall statue of Chairman Mao in the Chinese Embassy. He was overjoyed and lingered in front of the statue for a long time, reluctant to leave. Finally, he requested that the Chinese comrades allow him to take a photograph in front of Chairman Mao's statue as a memento. The Chinese comrades immediately fulfilled his wish. He excitedly told the Chinese comrades, "I love Chairman Mao the most, I admire Chairman Mao the most. I even drew a portrait of Chairman Mao myself and hung it at home. Every morning when I wake up, I first look at Chairman Mao's portrait. As soon as I see him, I feel full of strength throughout my body!"

    一看见毛主席像，浑身都是力量
    一位印度青年工人在中国大使馆内看见了高大的毛主席塑像，高兴极了。他在像前久久逗留，不愿离去。最后他要求中国同志让他在毛主席像前摄影留念。中国同志立即满足了他的心愿。他激动地对中国同志说：“我最最热爱毛主席，最最崇拜毛主席。我自己还画了一张毛主席像挂在家里。我每天早晨起来首先要看一看毛主席像。一看见他老人家，我全身都是力量！”
