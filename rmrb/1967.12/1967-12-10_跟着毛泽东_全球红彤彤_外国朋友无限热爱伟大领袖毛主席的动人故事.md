Following Mao Zedong, forever revolutionize. Following Mao Zedong, the world is red. This is the bold declaration of revolutionary people around the world.

For the revolutionary people of the world, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is a weapon of struggle, a treasure trove of wisdom, a source of strength, and a guarantee of victory. The revolutionary people of the world love Chairman Mao and have unshakable faith in Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong—The Contemporary Lenin

On the morning of National Day, in a special car for foreign guests heading towards Tiananmen Square, the instructor and a young Colombian friend were chatting. Suddenly, the young boy looked up and saw the instructor wearing a shiny gold Mao Zedong badge, and excitedly jumped up, shouting, “Mao Zedong—the contemporary Lenin! Mao Zedong—the contemporary Lenin!” Then, with both small hands gently stroking the Mao Zedong badge, he affectionately said, “Uncle Soldier! Your country has the great genius, revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, but we don’t have…” He then took out a red copy of “Quotations from Chairman Mao” from his pocket and said firmly and proudly, “Mao Zedong is our great teacher, our great leader, the brightest red sun in the hearts of the world’s revolutionary people. I will definitely study Chairman Mao’s books in red China, by Chairman Mao’s side, and when I return home, I will make revolution and build our country to be like yours in China.”

Red Heart Always Toward Mao Zedong

A beautifully crafted Mao Zedong quotation board hangs at the entrance of the hotel. We use it to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to friends from the five continents day and night. One evening, around six o’clock, an elderly man with white hair from a European country walked out of the hotel singing the Mao Zedong quotation song “The Core Force Leading Our Cause.” He naturally stopped in front of the Mao Zedong quotation board, gazing up at Chairman Mao’s latest instructions with immense respect, and read aloud, word by word, “Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism.”

Seeing the elderly man’s sincere love and strong feelings for Chairman Mao, my heart was already pounding with excitement. I happily approached him and asked, “Which country are you from?” He solemnly replied, “I am not from a foreign country, I am from China, I am from China!” I was puzzled, and the old man smiled and said to me, “Friend, I’ll tell you frankly, my skin is foreign, but my heart is Chinese. My red heart is always toward the great China, toward the great genius of our time, Mao Zedong.”

A Red Sun Rises in the Heart

Late at night, around ten o’clock, the duty officer suddenly noticed a foreign child crying under the light. The duty officer approached and asked with concern, “Little friend, what’s wrong?” He asked three times, but the child did not answer, still crying and searching intently. The duty officer also helped her search. Finally, he found a shiny gold Mao Zedong badge on the ground. The duty officer quickly picked it up. The child swiftly snatched it away, holding it to her chest, and her face lit up with a smile, shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!” Then she raised the shiny gold Mao Zedong badge with her left hand and happily said, “Uncle, this is what I was looking for! This is what I was looking for!” The child recited passionately, “The sun is red, the sun is bright, Chairman Mao’s glory shines in all directions, the great leader Mao Zedong, every red heart is with you, wearing the Mao Zedong badge, a red sun shines in the heart, closely following the helmsman Mao Zedong, a red sun rises in the heart.”

Wishing Chairman Mao Eternal Life!

In late September, a British child ran to our sentry post, taking big strides to stand in front of a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, gazing at Chairman Mao’s solemn and kind face, with two streams of happy tears flowing down. Suddenly, he turned around, threw himself into my arms, tightly hugging my legs, with tears in his eyes, he told me, “Uncle Soldier, I’m going back to my country. I don’t want to leave China, I don’t want to leave Uncle Mao, China is good! Uncle Mao is good!” I held his small hand, hugged him, and carefully took off the shiny gold Mao Zedong badge from my chest and pinned it neatly on his chest. He kept waving his small fists, shouting, “Long live Uncle Mao! Long live Uncle Mao!” … The child’s voice was a bit hoarse, but he still shouted with all his might, “Wishing Uncle Mao eternal life! Eternal life!”

The Great Truth

In the morning, an American friend hurriedly came to me, panting and said, “Friend, can you give me a copy of ‘Selected Works of Mao Zedong’?” Looking at his eager eyes, I was so moved that I couldn’t speak for a long time, just nodding and saying, “Yes! Yes! Yes!” When I handed him a shiny red book, he jumped with joy, tightly holding it to his chest, looking at the radiant “Selected Works of Mao Zedong,” he couldn’t help but shed tears of joy, repeatedly shouting, “Long live Mao Zedong! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!” He held my hands excitedly and said, “The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is a great truth applicable everywhere, a lighthouse guiding the world’s revolutionary victories, the lifeblood of the world’s revolutionary people.”

    跟着毛泽东  全球红彤彤
    ——外国朋友无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的动人故事
    跟着毛泽东，永远干革命。跟着毛泽东，全球红彤彤。这是全世界革命人民的豪言壮语。
    对全世界革命人民来说，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是斗争的武器，智慧的宝库，力量的源泉，胜利的保证。全世界革命人民无限热爱毛主席、无限信仰毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东——当代的列宁
    国庆节的早晨，在驶向天安门的一辆外宾专车上，指导员和一位哥伦比亚小朋友正在说笑。突然，这个小朋友抬头看见指导员胸前佩戴着一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章，便伸出大拇指，兴奋地跳了起来，高呼着：“毛泽东——当代的列宁！毛泽东——当代的列宁！”然后两只小手轻轻地抚摸着毛主席像章，亲切地说道：“解放军叔叔！你们国家有伟大的天才、革命的领袖毛泽东，可是，我们国家没有……”他说着便从衣袋里掏出红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，坚信而又自豪地说：“毛泽东就是我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖，是世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳。我一定要在红色的中国、毛主席身边好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，将来回国去闹革命，把我们的国家建设得象你们中国一样。”
    红心永远向着毛泽东
    宾馆的大门口悬挂着一块精制的毛主席语录板，我们利用它日日夜夜向来自五大洲的朋友宣传毛泽东思想。一天晚上六点多钟，一位来自欧洲国家的白发苍苍的老人，高唱着毛主席语录歌《领导我们事业的核心力量》，由宾馆向外走来。她走到毛主席语录板前很自然地站住了，两眼仰望着毛主席的最新指示，怀着无比崇敬的心情，一字一字地朗读着：“要斗私，批修”。
    我看到这位白发苍苍的老人对毛主席的真挚热爱和强烈感情，心早就激动得怦怦直跳。我高兴地迎了上去问道：“你是来自哪个国家的？”她一本正经地说：“我不是外国的，我是中国的，我是中国的！”我正在纳闷，这位老人笑容满面地对我说：“朋友，我坦率地告诉你，我的皮肤是外国的，我的心是中国的，我的红心永远向着伟大的中国，向着当代伟大的天才毛泽东。”
    心中升起了红太阳
    晚上，十点多钟了，值班员突然发现灯光下有一位外国小朋友在抽泣。值班员上前关心地问道：“小朋友，怎么啦？”连问了三次，她也没有回答，还是一边哭一边全神贯注地寻找。值班员也帮她一道寻找起来。他终于发现在地上有一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章。值班员一个箭步走上前去，双手拾了起来。小朋友手急眼快一把夺过去，双手捧在胸前，脸上露出了笑容，喊道：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”然后她左手高举金光闪闪的毛主席像章，高兴地说：“叔叔，我找的就是这个！我找的就是这个！”这位小朋友满怀激情地朗诵道：“太阳红，太阳亮，毛主席光辉照四方，伟大领袖毛主席，颗颗红心向着您，戴上毛主席像章，一轮红日照心房，紧跟舵手毛主席，心中升起红太阳。”
    敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    九月下旬，一位英国小朋友向我们哨所跑来，大踏步走到毛主席巨幅画像前，仰望毛主席庄严慈祥的面容，两行幸福的热泪直往下流。猛然间，他转过身来，扑到我的身上，紧紧抱住我的双腿，两眼含着泪水向我诉说：“解放军叔叔，我就要回国了。我不愿意离开中国，我不愿离开毛伯伯，中国好！毛伯伯好！”我一把握住他的小手，把他抱在怀里。我小心地从胸前摘下金光闪闪的毛主席像章，端端正正地戴在他胸前。他不停地挥舞着小拳头高呼着：“毛伯伯万岁！毛伯伯万岁！”……小朋友的声音有些嘶哑了，但他还是使出全身力气高呼着：“敬祝毛伯伯万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    伟大的真理
    早晨，一位美国朋友急急忙忙走到我的跟前，气喘吁吁地说：“朋友，你能够送我一本《毛泽东选集》吗？”我望着他那双期待的眼睛，感动得半天说不出话来，只是点着头说：能！能！能！当我把一本金光闪闪的红书赠送给他时，他乐得一蹦老高，紧紧捧在怀里激动地注视着光芒四射的《毛泽东选集》，不禁热泪盈眶，一个劲地高呼：“毛泽东万岁！毛泽东思想万岁！”他握着我的双手兴奋地说：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的伟大真理，是指导全世界革命胜利前进的灯塔，是世界革命人民的命根子。”
