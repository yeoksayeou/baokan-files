	Cambodian government denounces U.S. and Thai reactionaries for massacring Cambodian residents

	The Cambodian government recently issued a statement denouncing the barbaric crimes of the U.S. government and the Thai puppet regime in massacring Cambodian civilians. The statement said: On November 22, about 60 Cambodians were blown up by landmines set near the border at Takatase, about five kilometers inside Cambodian territory, killing two and injuring one. On November 25, the village of Srey Sanh in the Xaysomboun District of Battambang Province was attacked by people from the Thai side, killing one woman and injuring seven others. The statement pointed out that the U.S. government and the Thai regime are the masterminds behind these crimes, as the murderers, equipped, trained, and supported by the United States, have been using Thai territory and invading Cambodia under the orders of the Thai regime.

	West German youth protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam

	On the evening of December 14, about 1,000 West German youth held a demonstration in Cologne, strongly protesting against U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

	The demonstrators carried the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and numerous placards with slogans such as "Stop the U.S. aggressors!" and chanted the name of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, as they marched through the city center.

	When the crowd reached the "American House," a U.S. imperialist cultural propaganda institution in Cologne, the demonstrators angrily shouted, "Hang Johnson!" "Yankees go home!" They also set off explosives to express their protest. After the march, a mass protest rally was held.

	U.S. recruits low-IQ, weak individuals to fight in Vietnam

	Facing heavy casualties and a shortage of troops on the Vietnam battlefield, the Johnson administration, in a desperate attempt to alleviate the manpower crisis, plans to draft an additional 100,000 soldiers annually from those who do not meet the enlistment standards.

	These individuals include those with low intelligence and physical defects, some of whom cannot even lift 35 pounds.

	The Johnson administration's desperate and indiscriminate measures clearly indicate that the U.S. war in Vietnam has reached a critical and hopeless situation.
