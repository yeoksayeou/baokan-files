"Only socialism can save China." "Apart from socialism, there is no other way out." Chairman Mao's great teachings are absolutely correct truths no matter where they are applied. The militia and poor and lower-middle peasants of the Red Flag Militia Brigade, Hongwu Village Militia Camp, are firmly convinced of Chairman Mao's teachings. No matter how strong the wind or how high the waves, we follow him closely, step by step, from forming mutual aid teams and cooperatives to establishing people's communes, always leading the way.

However, China's Khrushchev and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party have frantically opposed our march on the socialist road. Five years ago, when our country was hit by consecutive natural disasters and faced temporary economic difficulties, they thought the time had come and launched a fierce counterattack. China's Khrushchev shouted for individual farming; the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party yelled, "Regardless of whether the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat," advocating "production quotas to households, responsibility to households, land distribution to households." This black wind once blew into our Subei Haian region. The capitalist-roaders within the Party in Haian region stipulated that light work goes to households, irrigation ditches to households, one mu of land for borrowing seeds, and ten mu of marginal land to individuals. This is like silkworms eating mulberry leaves, bit by bit eating up one-fifth of the collective fields.

Socialism retreats one inch, capitalism advances one yard. The evil winds of land distribution to households and light work to households caused production losses, brought chaos to the collective economy, and allowed capitalism to spread widely. Looking back now, at least six major harmful effects can be seen:

First, losing the battlefield. After light work and land distribution to households, it is not conducive to organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's works, not conducive to propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletariat loses the ideological battlefield in the countryside.

Second, fostering selfishness. After land distribution to households, everyone calculates their own accounts, beats their own drums, and busies themselves with their own marginal land and irrigation ditches, with only a small "heaven and earth" in their hearts. Selfishness grows, and capitalist thoughts rise.

Third, not conducive to supervising landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. These guys take advantage of the opportunity to work separately to engage in sabotage activities and are not supervised by the masses.

Fourth, severely undermining the collective economy. After marginal land distribution to households, one mu of land for borrowing seeds, and expanding private plots, phenomena such as expanding private plots, marginal land, borrowed land, and grave land appeared. Thus, shovel by shovel, they are undermining the foundations of socialism.

Fifth, uneven crop growth. Household cultivation and management levels vary, resulting in "three-story" phenomena in a single field or a single ridge of corn seedlings, with tall and short, good and bad, uneven growth.

Sixth, seriously affecting yield. Not only is it impossible to promote new agricultural technologies, but also public and private interests clash in "three contests": contesting for fertilizer, labor, and seasons. Small private plots have too much fertilizer applied; large fields have no fertilizer and no management, and grain and cotton yields drop sharply.

The six major harmful effects all stem from China's Khrushchev and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party advocating the "black cat, white cat" theory, attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside through means such as "land distribution to households." Their wolfish ambitions are truly evil! We warn China's Khrushchev and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party: even if your mouths are as foul as dung beetles, they cannot tarnish the glory of the people's commune in the slightest. We, the broad masses of militia and poor and lower-middle peasants, rely on the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to repel the evil winds of land distribution to households and light work to households, implement the Dazhai-style work-point system, establish a new production order, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, change our spiritual outlook for the better, increase grain and cotton yields, and make the collective economy thrive. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We support the Three Red Banners, the people's commune is good! The broad masses of militia and commune members will definitely walk the broad socialist road!

    鼓吹单干就是复辟资本主义
    红武大队民兵营教导员　吴大如
    “只有社会主义能够救中国。”“除了社会主义，再无别的出路。”毛主席的伟大教导是放到任何地方都是绝对正确的真理。我们角斜“红旗民兵团”红武大队民兵营的民兵和贫下中农，就是一心无二地坚信毛主席这一教导，不管风多大，浪多高，紧跟他老人家，一步一个脚印，从成立互助组、合作社，到建立人民公社，一直走在前头。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派却疯狂地反对我们走社会主义道路。五年前，正当我国连续遭受自然灾害，经济暂时发生困难的时候，他们认为时机到了，就疯狂地反扑过来。中国赫鲁晓夫大喊单干；党内另一个最大的走资派大叫：“不管白猫黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫”，鼓吹“包产到户，责任到户，分田到户”。这阵黑风也一度刮到我们苏北海安地区。海安地区党内走资派，规定轻活到户、墒沟到户、一分地借种、十边地到人。这就象蚕儿吃桑叶一样，一口一口地吃掉集体大田的五分之一。
    社会主义退一尺，资本主义攻一丈。分田到户、轻活到户的妖风，使生产受到损失，给集体经济带来混乱，让资本主义大大泛滥。现在回过头来看，至少有六大恶果：
    第一，失去阵地。轻活到户、分田到户后，不利于组织群众学习毛主席著作，不利于宣传毛泽东思想，无产阶级失去了农村的思想阵地。
    第二，滋长私心。分田到户后，各打各的算盘，各敲各的锣鼓，各忙各的十边地、墒沟田，心中只有小“天地”。私心滋长，资本主义思想上升。
    第三，不利于监督地、富、反、坏。这些家伙利用各自分散干活的机会，进行破坏活动，得不到群众监督。
    第四，大挖集体经济墙脚。十边地到户、一分地借种、自留地扩大后，出现了扩大自留地、十边地、借种地和坟茔地等等怪现象。就这样一锨一锹地在挖社会主义墙脚。
    第五，作物长势不齐。分户培植，管理水平有高有低，在一块田内、一条畈上的玉米苗，出现“三层楼”的怪现象，高矮不齐，好丑不匀。
    第六，严重影响产量。不仅无法推广新的农业技术，而且公和私发生“三争”的现象，就是争肥料、争劳力、争季节。小块私有田，肥料下得太多；大田无肥下地，无人管理，粮棉产量直线下降。
    六大恶果，归到一条根上，就是中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派鼓吹“白猫”、“黑猫”论，妄图通过“分田到户”等手段，达到在农村复辟资本主义的目的。真是狼子野心，坏透坏透！警告中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派，你们这些喷屎螂的嘴再臭，也无损人民公社半点光辉。我们广大民兵和贫下中农社员靠光焰无际的毛泽东思想，打退了分田到户、轻活到户的妖风，实现了大寨式评工记分，建立了崭新的生产秩序，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高高的，把人的精神面貌换得新新的，把粮棉产量搞得足足的，把集体经济办得旺旺的。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们就是拥护三面红旗，人民公社就是好！社会主义康庄大道，我们广大民兵和社员就是走定了！
