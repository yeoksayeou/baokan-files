Chen Diangui, a comrade who was a "one-on-one" partner with me, died a martyr. His spirit of selflessness and fearlessness, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will forever inspire us.

Chen Diangui and I were in the same platoon when he joined the army. Later, we became "one helps one" and "one red pair." After he sacrificed his life to save the Red Guards, my heart has been heavy. His deeds, which shone with the light of "public spirit," keep coming to my mind.

In the spring of 1965, soon after Chen Diangui joined the army, our unit conducted a 300-mile forced march. One night, we arrived at a campsite very tired. After washing our feet, everyone lay down to rest. When I woke up, I saw Chen Diangui studying Chairman Mao's works by the light of a small homemade battery lamp. I urged him to rest, but he whispered, "With Mao Zedong Thought, we have direction and energy. No matter how tired we are, we won't feel it during the march." From the day he joined the army, Chen Diangui insisted on "daily reading" and never relaxed in arming his mind with Mao Zedong Thought.

In daily work, Chen Diangui was always ahead of everyone else. Last spring, a heavy rain collapsed our company's water reservoir. Chen Diangui immediately took off his shoes and jumped into the water to repair it. In daily life, it was rare to see him idle. Comrades affectionately called him the "revolutionary old ox." Chen Diangui also cared deeply about other companies. He often said, "A revolutionary soldier, while in the company, should have the seven hundred million people in his heart and see the whole world in his eyes."

Chen Diangui's short life was full of the brilliance of the proletarian "public spirit." In the countryside, he was a good commune member who worked for the public good. In the army, he was a good soldier who worked for the public good. He loved Chairman Mao, loved Mao Zedong Thought, and loved Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the battle to rescue Red Guards in the Ganjiang River, he showed with his most heroic actions that soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most selfless and fearless. Such soldiers can endure the test of sacrificing personal interests in daily life and do everything for the public good; in critical moments, they can endure the test of sacrificing their lives and shed their hot blood for the people.

### 毛泽东思想武装的战士最无私最无畏

    毛泽东思想武装的战士最无私最无畏
    陈佃奎烈士生前“一对红”战友　刘宗昌
    陈佃奎同志入伍就和我在一个班。后来，我们俩结成了“一帮一”“一对红”。他为抢救红卫兵小将光荣牺牲后，我的心情一直不能平静下来。他生前那一件件闪烁着“公”字光辉的事迹，时时涌上我的心头。
    一九六五年春天，陈佃奎同志入伍不久，部队组织了三百里的急行军。有一天深夜到达宿营地，大家都很疲劳，洗完脚就躺下休息了。我一觉醒来，看到陈佃奎同志却亮着自制的小电池灯，在专心致志地学习毛主席著作。我催他早点儿休息，他小声对我说：“咱们有了毛泽东思想，就有了方向，有了劲头，行起军来再累也不觉得累。”陈佃奎同志从入伍第一天起，就坚持“天天读”，一刻也不放松用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。
    平时连队的一些工作，陈佃奎同志总是抢在前面，做在头里。去年春上一场雨把我们连队的蓄水池冲塌了。陈佃奎看到后，马上脱掉鞋子，跳下水去修。日常生活中，很少见他闲着的时候，同志们都亲热地称他为：“革命的老黄牛”。陈佃奎同志对兄弟连队也是同样关心。他常说：“一个革命战士，身在连队，心里要装着七亿人民，眼里要看到全世界。”
    陈佃奎同志短暂的一生，无处不闪烁着无产阶级“公”字的光辉。在农村，他是一个一心为公的好社员。到了部队，他又是一个一心为公的好战士。他无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想，无限热爱毛主席的革命路线。在赣江激流抢救红卫兵小将的战斗中，他用最壮烈的行动，告诉了人们：毛泽东思想武装的战士最无私，最无畏。这样的战士，平时能经得起牺牲个人利益的考验，做到处处为公；关键时刻就能经得起牺牲个人生命的考验，做到笑洒热血为人民。
