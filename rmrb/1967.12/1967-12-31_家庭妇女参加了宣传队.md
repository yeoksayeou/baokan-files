Residents of China Strong Lane in Beijing held an evening performance.

On stage, they performed "The Old Couple Studies the Selected Works of Chairman Mao." In terms of artistic level, it was not "profound," but because the "performers" were filled with deep class feelings, every word and every note expressed their boundless love, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao. Every word and sentence resonated with the audience, sparking wave after wave of enthusiastic applause.

Who were the "performers"?

They were two ordinary women from the neighborhood. One was named Dong Lifeng, and the other was named Wang Xiling.

Speaking of Dong Lifeng performing on stage, there is a story behind it.

Dong Lifeng, over forty years old, had four children. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, she rarely attended meetings. She spent her days at home washing dishes, taking care of the children, and doing needlework for the family. Children and housework kept her from going out, let alone performing on stage. Even when her daughter sang, she found it annoying.

Recently, the neighborhood held a class to study the thoughts of Mao Zedong. Dong Lifeng also participated.

The first lesson was studying the "Three Articles." Dong Lifeng compared Zhang Side, Bai Qiu'en, and herself, feeling very ashamed. At night, she couldn't sleep, tossing and turning, thinking: If I continue to live like this, only caring about personal and family matters, isn't that lighter than a feather? If I serve the people for a lifetime, then I can become a noble person. She made a resolution to serve the people to the best of her ability, doing as much as she could.

Where to start?

Just at this time, the neighborhood established a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team. Dong Lifeng thought: Propagating Mao Zedong Thought, making everyone love Chairman Mao, and letting Mao Zedong Thought take root in everyone's heart is a matter of great importance for thousands of years and tens of thousands of years. Yes, propagating Mao Zedong Thought is also serving the people! Dong Lifeng signed up to join the propaganda team.

Dong Lifeng couldn't read, and performing and singing were really difficult. What to do? Learn from the old man who moved mountains, "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." She followed the radio, learning sentence by sentence, and let her daughter teach her letter by letter. The daughter taught a few times, getting impatient with her mother's slow learning. Dong Lifeng did some work on her daughter: In the old society, Mother couldn't eat or wear, how could she go to school and learn to read? If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, wouldn't you be just like Mother, an illiterate? Chairman Mao saved us poor people from the sea of fire, and we must sing from the heart for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party!

Mother's heartfelt words moved the daughter, and from then on, the daughter took time every day to teach Mother to sing and perform. In a short time, due to Dong Lifeng's diligent practice, she could skillfully perform and sing more than ten Mao Zedong Quotations songs and programs praising Chairman Mao.

The festival came, and the person who was once called a "housewife" stood proudly on the socialist stage, singing wholeheartedly about our great leader and our great party!

The East is red,
The sun rises...

### 家庭妇女参加了宣传队

    家庭妇女参加了宣传队
    北京市中国强街道居民举行晚会。
    台上演唱《老两口学毛选》。论艺术水平，算不得“精湛”，但是，由于“演员”满怀着深厚的阶级感情，一字字、一声声表达了对毛主席的无限热爱，无限敬仰，无限忠心，字字句句唱到了观众心坎上，激起了一阵又一阵的热烈掌声。
    “演员”是谁？
    是两个普通的街道妇女。一个叫董礼芬，一个叫王喜玲。
    说起董礼芬登台演戏，倒是有一段故事。
    董礼芬，四十多岁，有四个孩子，无产阶级文化大革命运动以前，很少参加会，成年累月在家里刷锅、洗碗、看孩子，再就是为一家大小做针线。孩子、家务把她缠得大门不出，二门不到，不要说登台演戏，连她女儿唱歌，她听了也心烦。
    前些时，街道上举办了毛泽东思想学习班，董礼芬也参加了。
    第一课，是学习“老三篇”。董礼芬拿张思德、白求恩和自己相比，感到很惭愧。晚上，睡不着觉，她翻来复去地想：象这样生活下去，终日只为个人的小家庭的事，不是比鸿毛还轻吗？如果为人民服务一辈子，那就能成为一个高尚的人。她立下决心，尽力为人民服务，能做多少做多少。
    从那儿做起呢？
    正在这时候，街道上成立毛泽东思想宣传队。董礼芬想：宣传毛泽东思想，让人人热爱毛主席，让毛泽东思想在每个人心中扎根，这是千年大计，万年大计。对，宣传毛泽东思想也是为人民服务！董礼芬报名参加了宣传队。
    董礼芬不识字，演剧、唱歌实在有困难。怎么办？向老愚公学习，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”她跟着收音机一句一句地学，让女儿一字一字地教。女儿教了几次，嫌妈妈学得慢，有些不耐心了。董礼芬又做女儿的工作：妈妈在旧社会，吃不上，穿不上，那能上学识字。要不是毛主席、共产党，你还不是和妈妈一样，是个大文盲？毛主席从火海里救了我们穷苦人，我们就是要从心里歌唱毛主席，歌唱共产党！
    妈妈一片肺腑之言，打动了女儿，从此以后，女儿天天抽时间教妈妈唱歌、演剧。在不长的时间内，由于董礼芬勤学苦练，就能熟练地演唱十几首毛主席语录歌曲和歌颂毛主席的节目。
    节日来了，曾被人称做“家庭妇女”的人，更是扬眉吐气，豪迈地站在社会主义的舞台上，尽情地歌唱我们伟大的领袖，歌唱我们伟大的党！
    东方红，
    太阳升。……
