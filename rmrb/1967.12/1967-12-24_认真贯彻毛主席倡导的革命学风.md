Two factions should talk less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak for themselves, and each should do more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences.

Seriously Implementing Chairman Mao's Advocacy of Revolutionary Study Style

Beijing Peace Hotel Revolutionary Committee

How can we run a Mao Zedong Thought study class well? From our practice, we have come to realize that we must seriously implement and carry out Chairman Mao's advocacy of a good revolutionary study style. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The issue of study style is an issue of the thinking method of leading organs, all cadres, and all Party members; it is an issue of our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism; it is an issue of the work attitude of all Party comrades. Since this is the case, the issue of study style is a very important issue, it is the first important issue." In the process of running Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we first, in conjunction with the problems of the Cultural Revolution in the Peace Hotel, organized revolutionary workers to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works.

In the past, under the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, the revolutionary workers of the Peace Hotel were divided into two major factions during the Cultural Revolution, and the antagonistic sentiments were very serious. In view of this situation, we organized revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions." Through study, the revolutionary workers' ideological understanding was raised, the nature of the contradictions between the two factions was recognized, the root cause of the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions was exposed, and the method to resolve the contradictions was found. Everyone had a deep feeling: "In the past, we treated class brothers as enemies and fought 'internal wars' enthusiastically. This was a trick played by the Chinese Khrushchev. No matter how reasonable, it is unreasonable to have antagonistic sentiments with class brothers." At the same time, we carried out heart-to-heart talks among comrades, consciously did more self-criticism, let others speak for themselves about their shortcomings and mistakes, and gradually eliminated ideological barriers. On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, we reunited and achieved a revolutionary great union.

To further consolidate the revolutionary great union ideologically, we organized broad revolutionary workers to take Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, link it with their own ideological reality, and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. The workers of the Peace Hotel were deeply influenced by revisionism in the past. In the original two factions, those who did not receive bonuses said that those who received bonuses were "revisionist seeds" and "big red people"; those who received bonuses said that those who did not receive bonuses were "troublemakers" and "dead laggards," and so on. There was a serious antagonistic sentiment between the two factions. This was the result of the Chinese Khrushchev's advocacy of profit-first and material incentives. Therefore, in the study class, we insisted on criticizing every day, with everyone criticizing orally and in writing, using the boundless Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev. Some comrades, after criticizing material incentives, had a deep feeling: "Evaluation after evaluation, the more you evaluate, the more rigid it becomes. You gain a small benefit and fall into a big trap." Everyone fully realized that material incentives are a corrosive agent used by the Chinese Khrushchev to split and disintegrate the ranks of the working class, and a poisoned arrow shot at the socialist system. Through grasping the essential issues, criticizing selfishness and revisionism every day, the antagonistic sentiments between the two factions were further eliminated, and all hatred was directed at the Chinese Khrushchev, further strengthening the unity among revolutionary workers, and effectively consolidating and developing the revolutionary great union and the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Our study class, in conjunction with the development of the situation, organized everyone to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works according to the different situations at different times, and solved practical problems with a focus.

The first study class focused on studying "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," emphasizing the resolution of contradictions between the two factions, using Chairman Mao's teachings, closely linking them with the actual thoughts of the workers, raising ideological awareness, and making ideological preparations for achieving the revolutionary great union. The second and third study classes focused on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," emphasizing the consolidation and development of the revolutionary great union ideologically, criticizing selfishness and revisionism, overcoming factionalism, and further strengthening unity ideologically. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the study class focused on studying Chairman Mao's "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," emphasizing the overcoming of anarchism, localism, and other erroneous ideas, enhancing revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and establishing a new revolutionary order. In short, according to the different situations at different times, we organized revolutionary workers to study Chairman Mao's works with a focus, highlighting key points, linking them with reality, step by step, and achieving immediate results.

### 认真贯彻毛主席倡导的革命学风

    两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。						毛泽东
    认真贯彻毛主席倡导的革命学风
    北京和平宾馆革命委员会
    怎样才能办好毛泽东思想学习班？我们从实践中体会到，必须认真贯彻执行毛主席倡导的革命好学风。毛主席教导我们：“学风问题是领导机关、全体干部、全体党员的思想方法问题，是我们对待马克思列宁主义的态度问题，是全党同志的工作态度问题。既然是这样，学风问题就是一个非常重要的问题，就是第一个重要的问题。”我们在举办毛泽东思想学习班的过程中，首先结合和平宾馆文化大革命运动中的问题，有针对性地组织革命职工活学活用毛主席著作。
    过去，在中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线影响下，使和平宾馆的革命职工在文化大革命运动中分成了两大派，对立情绪很严重。针对这种情况，我们组织革命职工学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”通过学习，提高了革命职工的思想认识，认清了两派矛盾的性质，挖出了产生两派对立情绪的根子，找到了解决矛盾的方法。大家深有感触地说：“过去把阶级兄弟当敌人，打‘内战’很起劲，这是上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，千有理，万有理，和阶级兄弟闹对立没有理。”同时在同志之间开展谈心活动，自觉地多做自我批评，人家的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，彼此消除了思想隔阂，在毛泽东思想的基础上又重新团结了起来，实现了革命的大联合。
    为了进一步从思想上巩固革命的大联合，我们组织广大革命职工以毛泽东思想为武器，联系自己思想实际，斗私批修。和平宾馆职工过去受修正主义的流毒较深，在原来的两派中，没有得奖金的一派说得奖的人是“修苗子”、“大红人”；得奖金的一派说不得奖的人“调皮捣蛋”、“死落后”等等，两派有严重的对立情绪。这是中国赫鲁晓夫推行利润挂帅、物质刺激的恶果。因此，我们在学习班坚持天天批判，人人口诛笔伐，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想去批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义罪行。有的同志通过批判物质刺激后，深有感受地说：“评奖评奖，越评越僵，得了小利，上了大当。”大家充分认识到物质刺激是中国赫鲁晓夫分化瓦解工人阶级队伍的腐蚀剂，是射向社会主义制度的一支毒箭。通过抓本质问题，天天斗私，天天批修，两派对立情绪进一步消除了，把千仇万恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫的身上，进一步增强了革命职工之间的团结，有力地巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    我们学习班结合形势的发展，根据不同时期的情况，组织大家活学活用毛主席著作，有重点地解决实际问题。
    第一期学习班，重点学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《为人民服务》等光辉著作，着重解决两派之间的矛盾，用毛主席的教导，紧密联系职工思想实际，提高思想觉悟，为实现革命的大联合作思想准备。第二、三期学习班，重点学习毛主席的最新指示和《为人民服务》等光辉著作，着重从思想上巩固和发展革命大联合，斗私批修，克服派性，进一步从思想上增强团结。第四、五期学习班，重点学习毛主席的最新指示，着重解决正确对待干部、正确对待群众等问题，为实现革命的三结合创造条件。革命委员会成立后，学习班又重点学习毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《纪念白求恩》等光辉著作，着重克服无政府主义、小团体主义等错误思想，增强革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，建立革命的新秩序。总之，针对不同时期的情况，有重点地组织革命职工学习毛主席著作，突出重点，结合实际，一环紧扣一环，一步一个脚印，收到了立竿见影的效果。
