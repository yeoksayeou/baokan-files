The widespread distribution of Chairman Mao's works has provided the most favorable conditions for the entire Chinese people to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively.

Over the past year, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that touches people's souls, have combined study with practice, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They study a bit, apply a bit, study repeatedly, and apply repeatedly. Everyone fights against selfishness and criticizes revisionism, and in everything, they break down selfishness and establish the public interest. Learning and application are combined, and the results are immediate. The following are two small stories of officers and soldiers in the Air Force actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and breaking down selfishness to establish the public interest.

A screw cap fell off a flight helmet, reported, it would delay the flight; not reported, it might cause a serious accident. What to do?

He thought of the two "extremes."

A car full of pilots was speeding towards the airport. Pilot Wu Chuanjun discovered that a screw cap had fallen off his flight helmet and was very anxious.

After arriving at the airport, Wu Chuanjun carefully checked his aircraft but did not find the screw cap. He thought, "Could it have fallen off the aircraft I flew last time, number 84?" At this time, his comrades were preparing for the pre-flight checks next to aircraft number 84. His mind began a fierce struggle: report it, and the flight would be delayed for inspection, delaying the unit's flight time, and he would be blamed; not report it, and if the screw cap really fell off the aircraft, it could jam the control system, causing a serious accident.

At this moment, Wu Chuanjun's heart was racing, and he couldn't make up his mind. What to do? He habitually took out the red book from his pocket and carefully read Chairman Mao's teachings: "Comrade White's spirit of selflessness and dedication is shown in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every Communist Party member should learn from him." Suddenly, Wu Chuanjun's heart became clear.

Wu Chuanjun used Chairman Mao's instructions as a weapon to severely criticize his selfish thoughts. He happily ran to the squadron leader and made a report. After thoroughly checking with the squadron leader and confirming that aircraft number 84 did not have the screw cap, he then returned to his aircraft with a peaceful mind.

The flight time was delayed, but the thoughts of the two "extremes" were further deepened in the minds of the pilots and maintenance personnel through this incident.

Seeing a pilot with a swollen thumb affecting the operation of the aircraft, there was a process of exposing and fighting selfishness in this small matter.

Liu Guanghua's Three Battles Against Selfishness

Deputy Squadron Leader Liu Guanghua and pilot Sun Mingliang sat in the towing car, discussing the situation of this flight. During the conversation, Liu Guanghua noticed that Sun Mingliang was repeatedly massaging his right thumb. Liu Guanghua asked with concern, "What's wrong?" Sun Mingliang replied, "I injured my thumb playing ball, and it hurts when pulling the stick, especially when pushing the stick."

At this moment, Liu Guanghua thought, the next exercise is for me and Sun Mingliang to fly "dual aircraft combat." Now, Sun Mingliang's thumb is swollen. If reported to the leadership, he won't be allowed to fly, and I won't be able to fly either; if not reported, his injured thumb, the difficulty of "dual aircraft combat" is great, the changes are drastic, forcing him to fly, not only the quality is not guaranteed, but the flight safety is also threatened.

Suddenly, he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy, must be in the interest of the people. If there are errors, they must be corrected, this is called being responsible to the people." Chairman Mao's teachings are so warm! He thought, to fly one more time for myself, not to report the problem to the leadership, can this be called "being responsible to the people"? Can this be called "in the interest of the people"? The more he thought, the more he felt it was wrong, so he decided to report to the leadership.

Just as he made up his mind, he thought of the leadership's previous praise for our squadron's high attendance rate. If this time he stops flying, won't others say our squadron "can't stand praise"? Thinking of this, his resolve wavered again.

In the car, a quotation from Chairman Mao shined brightly: "We must advocate putting down the burden and starting the machine among the Party's cadres," which greatly encouraged Liu Guanghua. He decided again to report to the leadership.

Just at this critical moment, a new problem arose: I and Sun Mingliang are the leader and subordinate, we study together, fly together, and live together. It's so late to discover this, won't the leadership say I'm not thorough in my work? Thinking of this, he hesitated again. At this moment, a quotation he often recited immediately appeared in his mind: "When faced with a matter, first think of oneself, then think of others. Such a person is actually not a Communist Party member, at least not a pure Communist Party member." Therefore, he immediately reported to the leadership.

    学用结合　立竿见影
    毛主席著作的大量发行，为全国人民提供了活学活用毛主席著作最有利的条件。
    一年多来，人民解放军空军广大指战员，在触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命中，结合斗争实践，活学活用毛主席著作，学一点，用一点，反复学，反复用，人人斗私批修，事事破私立公，学用结合，立竿见影。这里介绍的就是空军部队指战员活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公的两则小故事。
    飞行帽上掉了一个螺帽，报告了，要耽误开飞；不报告，可能造成严重事故，怎么办？
    他想起了两个“极端”
    一辆满载着飞行员的汽车，朝着去机场的路上奔驰着。车上的飞行员武传军，发现自己的飞行帽上丢了一个螺帽，非常焦急。
    到机场以后，武传军仔细地检查了自己的飞机，没有发现螺帽。他想：“会不会掉在上次飞过的八十四号飞机上呢？”这时，战友们正在八十四号飞机旁做飞前的准备。他思想上开始了激烈的斗争：报告吧，要停飞检查，耽误部队开飞时间，自己要落埋怨；不报告吧，如果螺帽真掉在飞机上，卡住操纵系统，就会发生一场严重的事故。
    这时，武传军的心七上八下，拿不定主意。怎么办？他习惯地从口袋里掏出了红彤彤的宝书，认真地读着毛主席的教导：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”顿时，武传军的心开朗了。
    武传军用毛主席指示为武器，狠批了自己的私心杂念，高高兴兴地跑到大队长面前作了报告，又和大队长一起作了彻底检查，证实八十四号飞机上确实没有螺帽以后，他才安心地回到自己的飞机去。
    开飞时间虽然延误了，但是，两个“极端”的思想，通过这件事，却在飞行、机务人员的思想上进一步加深了。
    看到一位飞行员拇指肿了，影响操纵飞机。在这件小事上，有一个亮私斗私的过程。
    刘光华三斗私心
    副中队长刘光华和飞行员孙明亮坐在牵引车上，共同研究这次飞行的情况。交谈中，刘光华发现孙明亮不断地按摩着右手拇指。刘光华关切地问：“怎么啦？”孙明亮回答说：“打球时把拇指挫伤了，拉杆时还可以，推杆时痛得厉害。”
    这时，刘光华想，下一个课目，是我和孙明亮飞“双机空战”。现在，孙明亮的拇指肿了，向领导报告了，就不会让他飞，自己也飞不成；不报告吧，他的手指挫伤，“双机空战”难度大，变化剧烈，勉强去飞，不仅质量没保证，飞行安全也受到威胁。
    顿时，他想起了毛主席的教导：
  “我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”毛主席的教导是多么亲切啊！他想，为了自己多飞一次，就不向领导反映问题，这能算“向人民负责”吗？这能算“适合人民的利益”吗？他越想越觉得不对，于是决定向领导报告。
    刚下了决心，他又想起领导曾经表扬过我们中队出勤率高，如果这次停飞，别人不会说我们中队“经不起表扬”吗？想到这里，决心又动摇了。
    车上，一条毛主席语录：“要在党的干部中间提倡放下包袱和开动机器”金光闪闪地呈现在眼前，给了刘光华很大鼓舞，他再次决心向领导报告。
    就在这节骨眼上，新的问题又出来了：我和孙明亮是长僚机，同学习、同飞行、同生活，这么晚才发现，领导不会说我工作不深入吗？想到这里，又犹豫起来。这时，他常背诵的一条语录立刻在头脑中出现：“一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算”，“这种人其实不是共产党员，至少不能算一个纯粹的共产党员。”于是，他立即向领导作了报告。　（空新）
