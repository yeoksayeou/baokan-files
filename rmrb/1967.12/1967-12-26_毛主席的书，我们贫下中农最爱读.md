We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, have an unlimited admiration for Chairman Mao and an unlimited love for Chairman Mao's works. We eagerly await, day and night, to obtain more and more of Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's works are our weapons for revolution. With them, we dare to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea, fearing no difficulties; with them, we can be invincible.

October 1, 1966, is the most unforgettable day of my life. As a member of the provincial delegation to the National Day celebrations, I had the honor of seeing our dearest red sun, our great leader Chairman Mao, on Tiananmen Gate. Chairman Mao, with his vigorous steps, radiant face, and spirited demeanor, came to our side. I was so excited that I jumped up and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your good health is the greatest happiness for us five hundred million peasants, and the greatest happiness for all revolutionary people in China and the world. That night, we representatives stayed in Zhongnanhai, next to Chairman Mao. I was so happy that I couldn't sleep. Lying in bed, I softly repeated my vow over and over: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I will definitely study your works diligently and be your good student.

Before coming to Beijing, many poor and lower-middle peasants saw me off, one after another. They held my hands and said, "Little Wang, when you go to Beijing and see Chairman Mao, be sure to shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' for us!" I was fortunate enough to see Chairman Mao. To let the poor and lower-middle peasants in my village share this happiness, I brought back fifty copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," more than a hundred Chairman Mao badges, and more than two hundred portraits of Chairman Mao.

A ship sailing in the ocean needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought. After returning from Beijing, I, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's sacred books with great eagerness. Mao Zedong Thought has the greatest power. Once it is grasped by the masses, it will produce tremendous material force. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we quickly organized a vast army of cultural revolution and launched a vigorous proletarian cultural revolution.

In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, it was Mao Zedong Thought that gave us courage and strength, enabling us to withstand the threats and enticements of the class enemy. In the difficult days of struggle, every night, we would study Chairman Mao's works under the portrait of our great leader Mao, repeatedly reciting Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades should see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our spirits." "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, we will strive for victory." Under the brilliant guidance of invincible Mao Zedong Thought, after several months of struggle, we finally repelled the enemy's repeated ferocious counterattacks and achieved victory in the struggle.

Chairman Mao's works are like the sun, illuminating our hearts brightly. Now, our brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants are responding to Chairman Mao's great call: "To fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," we are setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. I am determined to forever stay with the poor and lower-middle peasants, to read Chairman Mao's books for life, to listen to Chairman Mao's words, to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

    毛主席的书，我们贫下中农最爱读
    贵州省革委会常委、修文县白窑大队党支部书记　王忠珍
    我们广大贫农下中农对毛主席无限崇拜，对毛主席著作无限热爱。我们日日盼，夜夜盼，总盼望能够得到更多更多的毛主席著作。毛主席著作是我们贫农下中农干革命的武器，有了它，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，任何困难都不怕；有了它，我们就能够无往而不胜。
    一九六六年十月一日，这是我终身最最难忘的一天。我作为省的国庆节观礼代表团成员，在天安门城楼上光荣地看到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳、我们伟大的领袖毛主席。毛主席他老人家迈着矫健的步伐，满面红光，神采奕奕，来到我们身旁。我兴奋得跳起来，不断地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”毛主席呵，毛主席！您老人家身体这样健康，是我们五亿农民最大最大的幸福，是全中国全世界革命人民最大最大的幸福。这天晚上，我们代表还住在中南海里，住在毛主席的身旁。我高兴得睡不着觉，躺在床上，我轻声地一遍又一遍地发出誓言：毛主席呵，毛主席！我一定好好学习您的著作，做您的好学生。
    来京之前，许多贫农下中农送了我一程又一程。他们拉着我的手说：“小王，你上北京见了毛主席，可要替我们多喊几声毛主席万岁啊！”我果真幸福地见到了毛主席。为了让我村的贫农下中农和我共享这个幸福，我给大家带回了五十本《毛主席语录》，一百多个毛主席像章和二百多张毛主席的像片。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。我从北京回来以后，就和贫农下中农一起，如饥似渴地学习毛主席的宝书。毛泽东思想威力最大，毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量。在毛主席的革命路线的指引下，我们很快组织起一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，轰轰烈烈地开展起无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，是毛泽东思想给了我们勇气和力量，使我们顶住了阶级敌人的恐吓和拉拢。在斗争的艰难日子里，每到深夜，我们就在伟大领袖毛主席像下面，学习毛主席著作，不断地背诵毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，经过几个月的斗争，我们终于击退了敌人一次又一次的猖狂反扑，取得了斗争的胜利。
    毛主席著作象太阳，照得我们心里亮堂堂。现在，我们大队贫农下中农响应毛主席的伟大号召：“要斗私，批修”，大办毛泽东思想学习班，掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的新的高潮。我决心永远和贫农下中农在一起，一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
