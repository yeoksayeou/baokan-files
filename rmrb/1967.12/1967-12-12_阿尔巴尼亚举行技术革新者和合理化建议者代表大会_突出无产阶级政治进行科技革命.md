Albania Holds Conference of Technological Innovators and Rationalizers
Emphasizes Proletarian Politics in Technological Revolution

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 10th: The Conference of Technological Innovators and Rationalizers of Albania was held from December 6th to 7th in Tirana. Eight hundred representatives from across the country in the fields of industry, agriculture, finance, science and technology, and education reported to the conference on the achievements of the Albanian working class in the movement for technological innovation and rationalization, following the guidance of the Fifth Plenum of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha on emphasizing proletarian politics, implementing self-reliance, and the mass line. They also exchanged advanced experiences.

This conference was convened by the Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania. Party and government leaders, including Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mehmet Shehu, attended the conference.

Nushi, Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania, spoke at the closing ceremony. He said that the conference was held at a time when our country is experiencing a thriving revolutionary situation and our people are continuously launching deeper and deeper movements for rationalization and innovation. Nushi said: The historic resolutions of the Fifth Plenum of the Party of Labor of Albania and the programmatic speech delivered by Comrade Enver Hoxha on February 6th have had a tremendous impact on our people, sparking a high tide of mass movements from the bottom up.

Nushi said: Comrade Enver Hoxha has said that, like any true revolution, the scientific and technological revolution will be carried out by the broad masses of the people, by the broad masses of workers. Therefore, the working class, especially technological innovators and rationalizers, as the bravest and most conscious fighters of progressive new things, should become the most conscious main force in this scientific and technological revolution.

Nushi then discussed that to further develop the movement for technological innovation and rationalization, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of workers, raise their class consciousness, and promote the principle of self-reliance and the spirit of innovation among all workers and experts.

Nushi said: Only with the unity, solidarity, and cooperation of technical personnel and workers, and only with the combination of scientific and technological theory with the practical experience of workers, can the scientific and technological revolution be successfully carried out. Only when our technical personnel emphasize politics and people, rather than technology and profession, can the scientific and technological revolution be realized. Our cadres and experts must go deeper into the workers, often go to the workshops and construction sites, work with the workers, listen to their opinions humbly, consult with them on matters, and learn from them.

Dejrami, Secretary of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Albania, also delivered a report at the conference. He said: As a component of the socialist revolution, the scientific and technological revolution is closely linked to the ideological and cultural revolution and is developing deeply on the basis of the ideological and cultural revolution. Therefore, the fundamental task of trade union organizations is always to carry out revolutionary class education for workers. Only by following the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha's guidance, the broad masses of workers who have been tempered in ideology and politics can successfully complete the scientific and technological revolution. In discussing the achievements of the working class in the movement for technological innovation and rationalization, he said: In just the first two years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, various economic sectors proposed 12,000 rationalization suggestions, more than twice the total of the first two Five-Year Plans. This vividly reflects the high level of socialist consciousness of our working class.

The conference adopted an appeal to all workers, rationalizers, technological innovators, and cadres nationwide, and awarded red banners and certificates to outstanding trade union organizations that have excelled in the movement for technological innovation and rationalization.

　　阿尔巴尼亚举行技术革新者和合理化建议者代表大会
    突出无产阶级政治进行科技革命
    据新华社地拉那十日电　阿尔巴尼亚技术革新者和合理化建议者代表大会六日到七日在地拉那举行。八百名来自全国工业、农业、财政、科技和文教战线上的代表，向大会汇报了阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级遵循劳动党第五次代表大会和霍查同志关于突出无产阶级政治、贯彻自力更生和群众路线的教导，在技术革新和合理化建议运动中取得的新成就，并交流了先进经验。
    这次大会是由阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会召开的。阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡等党政领导人出席了大会。
    阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会主席努什在大会闭幕时讲了话。他说，代表大会是在我国出现一片蓬蓬勃勃的革命形势和我国人民接连开展一个比一个更加深入的合理化建议和革新运动的时候举行的。努什说：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的历史性决议和今年二月六日霍查同志所作的《党和政权的进一步革命化》的纲领性的讲话在我国人民中产生了巨大的影响，掀起了自下而上的群众运动的高潮。
    努什说：霍查同志说过，象任何真正的革命一样，科学技术革命将由广大人民群众，由广大工人群众来搞。因此，工人阶级，特别是技术革命者和合理化建议者，作为进步的新生事物的最勇敢和最自觉的战士，应该成为科技领域内这场革命的最有觉悟的主力。
    努什接着谈到，为了进一步开展技术革新和合理化建议运动，必须加强职工的思想教育、提高职工的阶级觉悟，把自力更生原则和革新精神推广到全体工人和专家中去。
    努什说：只有技术干部同工人的团结、一致和合作，只有科学技术理论同工人的实际经验相结合，科技革命才能顺利开展；也只有我们的技术干部突出政治，突出人的因素，而不是突出技术和专业，科技革命才能实现。我们的干部和专家必须更多地深入到工人中去，经常下车间和工地，同工人一起劳动，虚心听取他们的意见，有事同他们商量，向他们学习。
    阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会书记德拉米也在大会上作了报告。他说：作为社会主义革命组成部分的科技革命是同思想文化革命紧密联系的，并在思想文化革命的基础上深入发展着。因此，工会组织的根本任务永远是对职工进行革命的阶级教育。只有遵循党和霍查同志的教导，在思想和政治上锻炼起来的广大劳动群众才能顺利完成科技革命。他在谈到工人阶级开展技术革新和合理化建议运动的成就时说：仅在第四个五年计划头两年，各经济部门提出一万二千项合理化建议，比头两个五年计划期间的合理化建议的总和还多两倍以上。这生动地体现了我国工人阶级高度的社会主义觉悟。
    大会通过了致全国工人、合理化建议者、技术革新者和干部的号召书，并向开展技术革新和合理化建议运动的优秀工会组织颁发了红旗和奖状。（附图片）
