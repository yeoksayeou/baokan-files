The third devaluation of the pound has caused great turmoil in the capitalist financial and monetary system. The position of the dollar has also become shaky. This is a symptom of the increasing decline of imperialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out with great insight that "the imperialist system is riddled with internal contradictions that cannot be resolved," and that "there will be 'earthquakes' there."

The devaluation of the pound is a severe "earthquake" caused by the various inherent contradictions within the imperialist system.

The pound and the dollar are the two main pillars of the capitalist world monetary system. On the one hand, Anglo-American imperialism uses the pound and the dollar, these two "world currencies," as tools to exploit the peoples of various countries. On the other hand, they engage in fierce currency wars with other imperialists, fighting for hegemony. The devaluation of the pound and the shaky position of the dollar reflect the intensifying contradictions and conflicts in the contemporary capitalist world.

Imperialism is now facing deepening political and economic crises. The development of revolutionary struggles by the peoples of the world, especially those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, has greatly weakened the strength of imperialism led by the United States. The capitalist world market is shrinking. Since the second half of last year, some capitalist countries have seen industrial production decline, exports plummet, international trade deficits soar, unemployment rise, and prices increase. A new severe capitalist economic crisis is approaching. This has made the life-and-death struggle among imperialists for the world market even more acute. In such a situation, the days of imperialism are getting harder, and the weakest, Anglo-American imperialism, is the first to suffer, facing particularly difficult circumstances.

Anglo-American imperialism is a highly parasitic colonial state. The collapse of the colonial system after the war has caused Anglo-American imperialism to plummet politically and economically. To maintain its "great power status," it has intensified the exploitation of the British people at home and followed the aggressive policies of U.S. imperialism abroad, resulting in further deterioration of the British economy, long-term stagnation of production, annual trade deficits, and a huge international trade deficit. The pound, as a symbol of Anglo-American imperialism's "power position," has therefore repeatedly faced crises. This year, Britain continued to face a huge international trade deficit, and its fiscal and economic situation is in a critical state. The pound is facing a new and more serious crisis. In this situation, the desperate British government had no choice but to announce the devaluation of the pound. This fully shows that the decaying and corrupt Anglo-American imperialism is at its wits' end and gasping for breath.

The pound and the dollar are both competitive and interdependent in the capitalist world monetary system. Therefore, the United States has tried to help the pound through many difficulties. However, the U.S. economy is now also in a precarious state, especially due to the Vietnam War, U.S. fiscal deficits are unprecedentedly large, gold reserves are decreasing, and the position of the dollar is precarious. The United States is neither able to single-handedly support the pound nor fears that a large devaluation of the pound will deal a fatal blow to the dollar. It can only allow the pound to "appropriately" devalue, so that the dollar can continue to eke out a living. This fully exposes the hollow and increasingly weak state of the U.S. imperialism.

France, representing Western European countries, has used the pound crisis to pressure Britain and intensify its struggle with the United States for European hegemony, which is an important reason for the devaluation of the pound. To expel U.S. influence from Europe and compete with the U.S. and Britain for the world market, France, in addition to withdrawing from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military integration and refusing to allow the U.S.'s junior partner Britain to join the "Common Market," has launched a fierce attack on the position of the dollar and the pound. It demands that the capitalist world's currency return to the gold standard, uses the dollars in its hands to exchange gold from the United States, withdraws from the international gold pool that supports the pound and the dollar, and repeatedly strikes at the pound and the dollar. In this pound crisis, France again refused to provide Britain with a large loan, forcing Britain to devalue the pound. France's goal is to strike at the dollar through striking at the pound. This situation shows that under the shadow of deepening political and economic crises of imperialism, the contradictions among imperialists are intensifying.

One of the important reasons for the devaluation of the pound is that the Suez Canal was closed in the struggle of the Arab people against the aggressors supported by the U.S. and Britain, the patriotic struggle of our compatriots in Hong Kong against British violence, and the strike by British dock workers, which dealt a greater blow to the already extremely difficult British economy. From this fact, it can be seen that the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of various countries have powerfully weakened the foundation of imperialism and neo-colonialism. The revolutionary peoples of the world are the gravediggers of the imperialist system.

The devaluation of the pound will not only fail to relieve the plight of Anglo-American imperialism but will instead accelerate the decline of Anglo-American imperialism and intensify the various contradictions and conflicts in the capitalist world. After the devaluation of the pound, a frenzy of buying gold and silver emerged, and the dollar came under strong pressure. De Gaulle again announced his refusal to allow Britain to join the "Common Market," publicly criticizing the U.S.'s ambition to control Europe, and launching an attack on the position of the dollar. Other capitalist countries have taken measures to strengthen their competition for the world market. The imperialist bloc has become more fragmented. At the same time, a series of countries, in order to protect the interests of monopoly capital, have implemented currency devaluation, wage freezes, increased taxes, and intensified the exploitation of the working people. The contradictions between imperialism and the reactionary forces of various countries and the peoples of various countries have become even sharper. All this can only make imperialism rot faster and hasten its complete collapse.

Just as the pound devalues and Anglo-American imperialism struggles desperately, the Soviet revisionist clique is courting British monopoly capital, throwing out a lifeline. They are currently discussing in Moscow with British big monopolists the issue of further expanding bilateral trade and "industrial cooperation," and plan to formulate a long-term "agreement linked to the long-term economic plans of the two countries." Before this, the Soviet revisionist clique had already turned the Soviet Union into an investment site for the monopoly capital of the United States, Italy, Japan, and other countries. The actions of the Soviet revisionist clique are essentially opening up the Soviet market to imperialism to ease the deepening political and economic crises facing imperialism.

However, the laws of historical development are not subject to human will. Any struggles of imperialism and any services rendered by the Soviet revisionist clique cannot save the imperialist system from extinction.

    帝国主义日益没落的一个征象
    本报评论员
    英镑第三次贬值，引起了资本主义金融货币体系极大的混乱。美元的地位也因而摇摇欲坠。这是帝国主义日益没落的一个征象。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席多次英明地指出，“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服”，“那里会发生‘地震’”。
    英镑贬值，就是帝国主义制度固有的种种矛盾所造成的一场剧烈的“地震”。
    英镑同美元是资本主义世界货币体系的两大支柱。英美帝国主义一方面利用英镑和美元这两种“世界货币”作为剥削各国人民的手段，一方面又围绕着它们同其他帝国主义展开激烈的货币战，进行争夺霸权的斗争。英镑贬值和美元地位的动摇，反映了当代资本主义世界的各种矛盾和冲突的日益激化。
    帝国主义现在正面临着日益加深的政治和经济危机。世界各国人民，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争的发展，大大削弱了以美国为首的帝国主义的力量。资本主义世界市场日益缩小。从去年下半年以来，一些资本主义国家相继发生工业生产下降，出口锐减，国际收支逆差激增，失业人口增加，物价上涨。一场新的严重的资本主义经济危机正在日益迫近。这就使得帝国主义之间争夺世界市场的你死我活的斗争更加尖锐起来。在这样的形势下，帝国主义的日子越来越难过，而最为虚弱的英帝国主义首当其冲，处境特别困难。
    英帝国主义是一个寄生性极强的殖民国家。战后殖民体系的崩溃，使英帝国主义在政治上和经济上一落千丈。它为了维持自己的“大国地位”，对内加紧剥削英国人民，对外追随美帝国主义的侵略政策，结果却使英国的经济状况更加恶化，生产长期停滞，对外贸易年年亏空，形成国际收支的巨大逆差。作为英帝国主义“实力地位”的象征的英镑，因此不断发生危机。今年英国继续出现巨额国际收支赤字，财政经济病入膏肓，英镑面临着新的更加严重的危机。在这种情况下，走投无路的英国政府不得不宣布英镑贬值。这充分表明衰老腐朽的英帝国主义已经山穷水尽，气息奄奄了。
    英镑和美元在资本主义世界货币体系中是相互竞争的，又是相互依存的。因此，美国曾经设法帮助英镑度过多次难关。但是，现在美国经济也处于风雨飘摇之中，特别由于侵越战争，美国财政赤字空前庞大，黄金储备日益下降，美元地位岌岌可危。美国既无力单独支持英镑，又怕英镑大幅度贬值将给美元以致命的打击。它只好让英镑“适度地”贬值，使美元得以继续苟延残喘。这就彻底暴露了外强中干的美帝国主义正在每况愈下，变得越来越虚弱了。
    以法国为代表的西欧国家利用英镑危机对英国施加压力，加紧同美国争夺欧洲霸权，是英镑贬值的一个重要原因。法国为了把美国势力排除出欧洲，并且同美英争夺世界市场，除了退出北大西洋集团军事一体化、拒绝美国的小伙计英国加入“共同市场”以外，还对美元和英镑的地位发动了猛烈的进攻。它要求资本主义世界的货币恢复金本位制，利用手里的美元向美国兑换黄金，退出了支持英镑和美元的国际黄金总库，不断给予英镑和美元以打击。在这次英镑危机中，法国又拒绝给予英国大量贷款，迫使英国不得不实行英镑贬值。法国的目的是通过打击英镑来打击美元。这种情况说明，在帝国主义政治经济危机不断加深的阴影笼罩之下，帝国主义之间的矛盾正在日益加剧。
    英镑贬值的重要原因之一，是苏伊士运河在阿拉伯人民反对美英合伙支持的以色列侵略者的斗争中遭到封闭，香港我爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争，以及英国码头工人的罢工，使本来就已经极端困难的英国经济受到了更大的打击。从这个事实可以看到，各国人民的反帝斗争，有力地削弱了帝国主义和新老殖民主义的统治基础。全世界革命人民是埋葬帝国主义制度的掘墓人。
    英镑贬值不仅不能使英帝国主义解除困境，相反，只能加速英帝国主义的没落，促使资本主义世界的各种矛盾和冲突更加激化。英镑贬值以后，出现了疯狂抢购黄金白银的浪潮，美元遭到强烈的冲击。戴高乐再次宣布拒绝英国加入“共同市场”，公开指责美国控制欧洲的野心，并且对美元的地位发动进攻。其他资本主义国家纷纷采取措施，加强对世界市场的争夺。帝国主义集团更加四分五裂了。同时，一系列国家为了保护垄断资本的利益，实行货币贬值、冻结工资、增加捐税，加强了对劳动人民的剥削。帝国主义和各国反动派同各国人民之间的矛盾也更加尖锐了。这一切，只能使帝国主义更加一天天烂下去，更快地走向全面的彻底的崩溃。
    正当英镑贬值、英帝国主义垂死挣扎的时候，苏修集团却向英国垄断资本大献殷勤，抛出了救生圈。他们正在莫斯科同英国的大垄断资本家讨论进一步扩大双方贸易和“实业合作”的问题，并且打算制定长期的“与两国远景经济计划相联系的协定”。在这以前，苏修集团早就把苏联变成美国、意大利、日本等国垄断资本的投资场所。苏修集团这种做法，实质上就是向帝国主义开放苏联的市场，来缓和帝国主义所面临的日益加深的政治经济危机。
    但是，历史发展的规律是不以人们意志为转移的。帝国主义的任何挣扎，苏修集团的任何效劳，都挽救不了帝国主义制度的灭亡。
