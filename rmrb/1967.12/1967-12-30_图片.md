The revolutionary workers of the casting workshop at Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory have fought for two months, breaking through the outdated technological constraints both domestically and internationally that insisted on using electric furnaces and reverberatory furnaces for casting aluminum parts. They boldly experimented and successfully used the existing old equipment, converting it into a cupola furnace to cast large aluminum parts, thus timely meeting the needs of the state. The image shows the proletarian revolutionary faction, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary technical personnel in this workshop using the cupola furnace to smelt and cast large aluminum parts.
