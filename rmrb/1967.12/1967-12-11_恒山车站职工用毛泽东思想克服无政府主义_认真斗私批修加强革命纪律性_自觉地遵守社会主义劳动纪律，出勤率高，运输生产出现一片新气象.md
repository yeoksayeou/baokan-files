	Workers at Hengshan Station Use Mao Zedong Thought to Overcome Anarchism
	Seriously Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism to Strengthen Revolutionary Discipline
	Consciously Observe Socialist Labor Discipline, High Attendance, and Transport Production Shows a New Prosperity

	People's Daily reports: The revolutionary cadres of Hengshan Station of the Harbin Railway Bureau, with the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain military unit, have been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have carried out the campaign of "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" to overcome the anarchist tendencies among some workers, strengthened proletarian discipline, and promoted both revolution and production. Transport production has shown a new prosperity.

	Hengshan Station is a large freight station of the Harbin Railway Bureau, responsible for the transportation of seven coal mines in Jixi, the coal city. In May and June of this year, some workers at this station were influenced by anarchist thoughts and exhibited some extreme democratic tendencies. A few workers did not strictly observe labor discipline and reasonable regulations, causing some losses to production. Facing this problem, the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the military and the leading members of the revolutionary cadres held repeated discussions. They believed that extreme democracy is a product of "selfishness," stemming from the freedom and disorderliness of the petty bourgeoisie, which is incompatible with the revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, and is very harmful to the revolution and production.

	Chairman Mao said: "It is necessary to point out the danger of extreme democracy, which lies in damaging and even completely destroying the party's organization, weakening and even completely destroying the party's fighting capacity, making the party unable to bear the responsibility of struggle, and thus causing the failure of the revolution."

	They decided to start from ideological education, organizing workers to repeatedly study the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," relevant parts of "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." They studied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, asking what Chairman Mao said and what they themselves did. In the process of study and discussion, everyone voluntarily carried out the struggle against selfishness and for the public good, making a thorough revolution in their souls. Combined with the study, they focused on class education, inviting old workers to introduce the miserable scenes of being oppressed and exploited by capitalists in the old society; at the same time, they explained to everyone the important position of railway transportation in promoting revolution and production. Through the study, everyone's awareness was raised. The workers said, "We are in Hengshan, but we must have a national vision and a global perspective." Revolutionary workers also exposed the crimes of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party who tried to sabotage production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, heightening revolutionary vigilance. The workers said: "A handful of capitalist roaders within the party are scheming to incite us to create anarchism and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. We will not fall for this! We must strengthen our revolutionary discipline, respond to Chairman Mao's call, promote both revolution and production, and do a good job in railway transportation."

	Now, the station has shown a new prosperity. The attendance rate of workers has reached over 95%. Everyone consciously punches in and out on time and adheres to the eight-hour workday. Workers regard the regulations that conform to Mao Zedong Thought as the standard for action, executing and following them resolutely.

　　恒山车站职工用毛泽东思想克服无政府主义
　　认真斗私批修加强革命纪律性
　　自觉地遵守社会主义劳动纪律，出勤率高，运输生产出现一片新气象
    本报讯　哈尔滨铁路局恒山车站的无产阶级革命派，在驻军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，开展“斗私，批修”，克服一部分职工中的极端民主化倾向，加强了无产阶级的纪律性，抓革命，促生产，运输生产出现一片新气象。
    恒山车站是哈尔滨铁路局一个较大的装货站，担负着煤城鸡西七个煤矿的运输任务。今年五、六月间，这个车站的一部分职工由于受了无政府主义思想的影响，出现了一些极端民主化的现象，少数职工不严格遵守劳动纪律和合理的规章制度，给生产带来了一定损失。面对这个问题，解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和无产阶级革命派领导成员在一起进行了反复研究。大家认为，极端民主化是“私”字的产物，它来源于小资产阶级的自由散漫性，同无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性是格格不入的，对革命和生产十分有害。
    毛主席说：“要指出极端民主化的危险，在于损伤以至完全破坏党的组织，削弱以至完全毁灭党的战斗力，使党担负不起斗争的责任，由此造成革命的失败。”
    他们决定从思想教育入手，组织职工反复学习“三大纪律、八项注意”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》的有关部分。带着问题请教毛主席著作，看看毛主席是怎么说的？自己是怎么做的？在学习讨论中，大家自觉地开展了破私立公的斗争，在灵魂深处大闹革命。结合学习，大抓阶级教育，邀请老工人介绍在旧社会受资本家压迫剥削的悲惨情景；同时又给大家讲当前铁路运输在抓革命促生产中的重要地位。经过学习，大家提高了认识，工人们说，“我们身在恒山，一定要胸怀全国，放眼世界。”革命职工还揭发了党内走资派制造事端，妄图破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪行，提高了革命警惕性。职工们说：“党内一小撮走资派阴谋煽动我们闹无政府主义，搞垮无产阶级专政，我们决不上这个当！我们一定要加强革命纪律性，响应毛主席的号召，抓革命，促生产，搞好铁路运输。”
    现在，这个车站出现了一派新气象，职工出勤率达到百分之九十五以上。人们都自觉地按时上下班，坚持八小时工作制。职工们把符合毛泽东思想的规章制度，当作行动的准则，坚决执行，坚决照办。
