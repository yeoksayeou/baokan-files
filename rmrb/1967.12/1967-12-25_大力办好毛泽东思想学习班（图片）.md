Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Shanghai are enthusiastically welcoming the publication of the important editorial "Strive to Run Good Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes" by the People's Daily. Workers and revolutionary masses from the Second Workshop of the Shanghai Electronic Tube Factory, who are participating in the factory's Mao Zedong Thought study class, are seriously studying this important editorial. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The two sides should speak less about each other's shortcomings and mistakes, let others speak about their own shortcomings and mistakes, and each should do more self-criticism, seeking great unity and tolerating small differences." They will consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution.

Revolutionary workers Gong Xuanzhen (left) and Xiao Bixia from the Guangzhou First Cotton Textile Factory said: "The counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev separated us, but the red line of Mao Zedong Thought brought us together again." Originally, they both entered the factory in 1948 as child laborers exploited by capitalists and had always been close. Due to the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of material incentives pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev, they became estranged. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie deepened their contradictions. After studying in the Mao Zedong Thought study class, they both conducted self-criticism and finally united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, forming a "red pair." This is a scene of them helping each other during work.

The revolutionary masses of the Shanghai Third Steel Plant, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism," have set up Anti-Japanese War-style Mao Zedong Thought study classes from the workshop to the factory, which has effectively promoted the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works by all the workers, further consolidated the revolutionary great alliance, and promoted the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people in the Xiaotangshan area of Beijing's Changping County. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres regard Mao Zedong Thought as their lifeline and place the study of Chairman Mao's works in the most important position, studying every day, in every matter, in the fields, and at home, determined to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Cui Village Commune's Maqiu Brigade Third Production Team's poor peasant member Liu Shoucai has set up a family study class, insisting on studying Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions every day. Through their studies, they have strengthened their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, deepened their hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, understood the principle of farming for the revolution, and the enthusiasm for collective production has reached an unprecedented height.

    上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，热烈欢呼《人民日报》《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》重要社论的发表。上海电子管厂第二车间参加厂举办的毛泽东思想学习班的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，正在认真学习这篇重要社论。他们决心遵照毛主席提出的“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异”的最新指示，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。

    广州第一棉纺织厂革命职工龚宣贞（左）和肖碧霞说：“中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线，使我俩分开，毛泽东思想红线把我俩又串了起来。”原来她俩都是一九四八年入厂受过资本家压榨的童工，感情一直很好，由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行物质刺激的反革命修正主义路线，使她俩不团结。在无产阶级文化大革命中，资产阶级反动路线又加深了她俩的矛盾。两人在毛泽东思想学习班学习后，各自进行了自我批评，终于在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，结成了“一对红”。这是她俩在劳动时互相帮助的情形。
