A piece of news from Nanchang shook the hearts of the Red Guards of Class 3, Grade 12 in a certain middle school – Comrade Li Wen Zhong, the platoon leader, had sacrificed his life while rescuing revolutionary comrades and masses who had fallen into the Ganjiang River.

Just a few months ago, Comrade Li had been with them day and night, fighting side by side. Although it was only for a brief twenty-five days, every minute of those days shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought!

The Great Leader Mao Sent Us a Good Soldier

On March 27th, Comrade Li, following the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the leftist masses," arrived at the school with the military and political training team, brimming with revolutionary enthusiasm.

"Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have arrived!" The news spread instantly. How many times had the Red Guards longed for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, hoping day and night? Today, the soldiers sent by Chairman Mao were finally fighting alongside them!

"Comrade soldier, please have some water!" "Comrade soldier, please wash your face!" The Red Guards welcomed their comrades with boundless enthusiasm. Comrade Li did not drink the water or wash his face; he put down his backpack and immediately hung up a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. Instantly, a red sun rose in the dormitory!

Under the sunlight, Comrade Li looked at the spirited Red Guards and felt his heart surge with emotion. It was these young fighters who dared to reach for the moon in the sky and catch the turtles from the depths of the ocean. Together with the broad revolutionary masses, they had smashed the old world to pieces and defeated the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party! It was these young fighters who, during the days of persecution by the capitalist reactionary line, fearlessly resisted oppression, braved the twists and turns, and fought valiantly. Comrade Li applauded their glorious achievements; he had long yearned to fight alongside them, and today, he finally stood among the Red Guards.

Comrade Li firmly remembered: Rain nourishes the seedlings to grow strong, and revolution relies on the great Mao Zedong Thought. The first words he spoke to the Red Guards were about how they were studying Chairman Mao's works, what new experiences they had gained, and what new levels they had reached.

Under the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Red Guards wrote a line of golden words: Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts! Comrade Li immediately exclaimed, "Excellent! This truly expresses our hearts! From now on, we will establish a rule: every morning, facing the sunrise in the east, we will wish our heart's most red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life!"

The night was deep, but the young fighters were too excited to sleep. The first thing the new platoon leader did, the first question he asked, the first rule he established... all these scenes flashed through their minds. Although the students were not yet familiar with the new platoon leader, in this brief encounter, the Red Guards had already understood the kind of soldier Chairman Mao had sent them!

"Listen to what Chairman Mao says!"

Day after day, fighting side by side, the students noticed that Comrade Li had a catchphrase: no matter what he did, he always said, "Listen to what Chairman Mao says!"

The revolutionary young fighters rose up to rebel against the capitalist reactionary line and faced ridicule and mockery from some people. Comrade Li encouraged the young fighters, saying, "Listen to what Chairman Mao says. The principles of Marxism are countless, but ultimately, it is just one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'"

The class achieved revolutionary great unity, but many students still had their own small calculations, and the rhythm of the big character posters and the steps of the revolution were not in sync. Comrade Li stood in front of the entire class and said, "Comrades, let's listen to what Chairman Mao says: 'The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of the various nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for our cause to win.'"

On the political training march, the Red Guards stepped on blisters and sweated as they marched on the rugged mountain paths for the first time. Comrade Li quickly walked to the front of the queue and waved his hand, shouting, "Comrades, listen to what Chairman Mao says!" Then, he led the students in loudly reciting, "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

After the magazine *Red Flag* published an article criticizing the "strike down a large group, protect a small group" line, it sounded the new battle call to attack the capitalist reactionary line. The Red Guards repeatedly studied the article and thought about a director in their school who was a victim of the capitalist reactionary line. This cadre, of worker-peasant origin, had always performed well. However, he was seized upon by the old county committee work team for individual mistakes, exaggerated out of proportion, and labeled a "counter-revolutionary." Position Bright decided to write a big character poster, first choosing this issue as the breakthrough point for attacking the capitalist reactionary line. However, he was also concerned about being labeled a "royalist" or "rehabilitating a 'counter-revolutionary.'" Should he write it or not? Position Bright asked Comrade Li for advice. Comrade Li listened and said, "This matter is too important! Listen to what Chairman Mao says! Chairman Mao teaches us to believe in and rely on the majority of cadres. But a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party stubbornly push the capitalist reactionary line of 'strike down a large group, protect a small group,' persecuting the broad revolutionary cadres. We must uproot this black line and thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the biggest capitalist roader within the Party! The Red Guards must not only be good at striking down a small group but also dare to unite the majority, liberating the broad revolutionary cadres from the capitalist reactionary line! Dare to rebel, dare to protect, this is the style of the revolutionary rebels." Position Bright, after hearing these words, gained courage and wrote a big character poster that shook the entire school overnight.

The Red Sun Shines on the Red Guards Every Day

Walking into the classroom of Class 3, Grade 12, one would see a golden, shining quotation board on each student's desk. Two pieces of crystal-clear glass framed a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and his great teachings, like a red sun rising on the desk, shining on the Red Guards, guiding them to grow stronger every day. Seeing these golden, shining quotation boards, people naturally thought of Comrade Li.

After Comrade Li Wen Zhong came to Class 3, Grade 12, he thought: If there were a red sun on each desk, shining on the Red Guards every day, guiding them to grow, that would be great! He bought bright red glossy paper, cut it into small squares, and had each student choose a quotation from Chairman Mao to write on it, neatly pasted on the desk. From then on, each student had a mirror in front of them, learning from it and comparing themselves to it, working with more vigor and moving forward with a clear direction. Time passed, the students progressed, and the quotation boards needed to be changed frequently. Comrade Li felt this was inconvenient. If several quotations could be pasted at the same time, and the student could choose which one to study, that would be great! So, he designed a "triangular three-dimensional quotation board" for the students, with quotations on three sides. The student could turn the board to face the quotation they wanted to study. Although this was more convenient, it was not easy to fix in place and could easily fall off. What to do? One Sunday, Comrade Li went to the city and saw a pile of broken glass in the corner of a department store. Comrade Li thought, if Chairman Mao's portrait and quotations were framed between two pieces of glass, the quotations could be changed at any time. Comrade Li immediately ran back to school, pushing a small cart, and brought these pieces of broken glass back. Together with the students, he started making quotation boards.

Thus, the quotation boards were made. From then on, each student's desk had a red sun that never set.

A Quotation for Every Heart

Time flew by, and the twenty-five days of military training came to an end. Comrade Li would leave the Red Guards he had fought alongside the next day. On this night of farewell, the Red Guards all eagerly asked Comrade Li to leave a photograph as a memento of their battle. Comrade Li thought, I came to conduct military training, carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions, listening to Chairman Mao's words, following the path Chairman Mao led, and achieving results as the Red Guards carried out Chairman Mao's instructions. What is there to remember in my photograph!

However, Comrade Li was actively preparing a "gift" for each Red Guard.

The faces of all thirty-six Red Guards in the class floated in his mind. Look, these young fighters, each full of vigor, were so lovable!

Red Guard responsible comrade Position Bright dared to rebel and dared to fight, but he still needed to calmly listen to the opinions of his comrades. Comrade Li should let him study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Because we are serving the people, so if we have shortcomings, we should not fear others pointing them out..."

Red Guard Liu Yue Min worked diligently and endured hardships, but was not very active. Comrade Li should give him the eight golden words: "Unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness."

Revolutionary comrade Xing Yue Xiang...

Comrade Li prepared a precious "gift" for each of the thirty-six Red Guards. A quotation for every heart, the soldiers and the Red Guards were closer than ever!

### 难忘的二十五天——“支左爱民模范”李文忠在某地一中军训散记

　　难忘的二十五天
　　——“支左爱民模范”李文忠在某地一中军训散记
    一个从南昌传来的消息，强烈地震动了某地一中十二级三班红卫兵小将们的心——李文忠排长为了抢救在赣江沉船落水的革命小将和革命群众，壮烈牺牲了。
    几个月前，李排长还和他们朝夕相处，共同战斗。虽然只有短短的二十五天，但这二十五天的每一分钟，都闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉！
    毛主席派来了好战士
    三月二十七日，李排长遵循伟大领袖毛主席的“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，满怀革命豪情，同部队军政训练团一起来到了一中。
      “解放军来了！”消息立即传开。曾多少次啊，红卫兵小将盼望着解放军，日日想月月盼，今天，毛主席派来的解放军终于和他们战斗在一起了！
      “解放军同志快喝杯水！”“解放军同志快洗洗脸！”红卫兵小将一片热情迎亲人。李排长水没喝，脸没洗，背包一搁，第一件事就是把随身带来的伟大领袖毛主席像张贴起来。顿时，宿舍里升起了一轮红太阳！
    阳光下，李排长望着一个个朝气蓬勃的红卫兵小将，心头激情翻滚。就是这些小将，敢上九天揽月，敢下五洋捉鳖。他们同广大革命群众一起把旧世界砸得落花流水，把党内一小撮走资派杀得一败涂地！就是这些小将，在受资产阶级反动路线迫害的日子里，不畏强暴，不怕曲折，英勇战斗……。李排长为他们一次次的辉煌战绩而喝采；早就向往着能和他们一起战斗的李排长，今天终于来到红卫兵小将中间。
    李排长牢牢记住：雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是伟大的毛泽东思想。他向红卫兵小将讲的第一句话，就是问毛主席著作学习得怎样，学出了什么新经验，用出了什么新水平……
    红卫兵小将在伟大领袖毛主席像下，写下一行金光闪闪的大字：敬祝心中的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！李排长立刻激动地说：“好极了，真是表达了我们的心愿！以后我们就建立一个制度，每天早晨迎着东方的朝阳，敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！”
    夜深了，小将们激动得久久不能入睡。这位新来的排长做的第一件事，问的第一句话，建立的第一个制度……一幕幕浮现在他们的脑海。虽然同学们还不熟悉这位新来的排长，然而就在这短暂的接触中，红卫兵小将已经了解到，毛主席给他们派来了一位怎样的战士！
    “听听毛主席是怎么说的！”
    朝朝暮暮共同战斗，日子久了，同学们都察觉李排长有个口头语，无论做什么事，总是离不了这句话：“听听毛主席是怎么说的！”
    革命小将起来造资产阶级反动路线的反，受到一些人的冷嘲热讽。李排长鼓励小将们说：“听听毛主席是怎么说的，马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”
    班级实现了革命大联合，不少同学还各自拨着一个小算盘，大批判鼓点敲不齐，革命步伐不一致。李排长站在全班面前说：“同学们，咱们听听毛主席是怎么说的，‘国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。’”
    在政治野营路上，红卫兵小将踩着血泡，淌着汗水，在崎岖的山路上进行第一次行军。李排长快步走到队伍前面，挥手喊道：“同学们，听听毛主席是怎么说的吧！”接着，他就领着同学们高声朗读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    《红旗》杂志批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的文章发表后，吹响了向资产阶级反动路线进攻的新的战斗号角。红卫兵小将位同亮一遍又一遍认真地学习，联想到自己学校里的一位教导主任，就是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。这位工农出身的干部，一贯表现较好。但是却被旧县委工作组抓住个别错误无限上纲，打成“反革命”。位同亮同学决定写一张大字报，首先选择这个问题，作为向资产阶级反动路线进攻的突破口。但是又担心会被扣上“保皇派”、“为‘反革命’翻案”等等罪名。写，还是不写？位同亮同学叫李排长给他出个主意。李排长听了，说：“这件事太重要了！听听毛主席是怎么说的！毛主席教导我们，要相信和依靠干部的大多数。可是，党内一小撮走资派顽固推行‘打击一大片，保护一小撮’的资产阶级反动路线，迫害广大革命干部。我们一定要把这条黑线连根拔掉，把党内最大的走资派散布的流毒彻底清除！红卫兵小将，不仅要善于打击一小撮，还要敢于团结大多数，把广大革命干部从资产阶级反动路线下解放出来！敢革敢保，这才是革命造反派的风格。”位同亮听了这一席话，增强了勇气，连夜写出了一张震动全校的大字报。
    红太阳时时照耀红卫兵
    走进十二级三班教室，就会看见每个同学桌头上都有一块金光闪闪的语录牌。两块晶莹透明的玻璃镶嵌着伟大领袖毛主席的照片和毛主席的伟大教导，就象一轮红太阳升起在桌头上，照耀着红卫兵小将天天向上，茁壮成长。看见这一块块金光闪闪的语录牌，人们就很自然地想起了李排长。
    李文忠来到十二级三班后，心想：如果每个桌头上都升起一轮红太阳，时时照耀着红卫兵小将成长，该多好啊！他买了鲜红的油光纸，裁成了一个个小方块，让每个同学针对自己的思想选一条毛主席语录写在上面，端端正正贴在桌头上。从此，每个同学眼前都有了一面明镜，事事学习，处处对照，工作有了劲头，前进有了方向。时间在前进，同学们在进步，语录牌也要不断更换。李排长觉得这样很不方便。如果能同时贴上几条语录，需要学习那一条就学习那一条，该多好啊！于是，他就给同学们设计了一个“三角立体语录牌”，三面都贴上毛主席语录，学习那条，就让那条面向自己。这样虽然方便多了，但是不好固定，容易弄掉。怎么办呢？一个星期天，李排长到城里看到百货公司的一个墙角上堆着一堆碎玻璃。李排长想，把毛主席像、毛主席语录镶在两块玻璃中间，语录不就随时可以换了吗？李排长马上跑回学校推小车，把这些碎玻璃运回来，和同学们一起做起语录牌来。
    就这样，语录牌做成了。从此，每个同学桌头上升起了一轮永远不落的红太阳。
    一条条语录一颗颗心
    时间过的真快，转眼二十五天的军训结束了。李排长明天就要离开并肩战斗的红卫兵小将了。在这离别的前夕，红卫兵小将都争着叫李排长留张照片，作为战斗的留念。李排长想，我来搞军训，执行的是毛主席的指示，听的是毛主席的话，路是毛主席他老人家领着走的，成绩是红卫兵小将按毛主席指示办事取得的。我的照片有什么值得留念的！
    不过，李排长还是在积极给每个红卫兵小将准备着“礼物”。
    全班三十六个红卫兵小将的面影，一个个浮现在他的脑海。看，这些小将们，个个朝气蓬勃，多么可爱！
    红卫兵负责人位同亮同学，敢革命，敢造反，就是对同学们提的意见还不能冷静听取，应该让他好好学习毛主席的教导：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出……”
    红卫兵小将刘月民，工作踏踏实实、吃苦耐劳，就是不太活跃，应该送给他“团结、紧张、严肃、活泼”八个金光闪闪的大字。
    革命小将邢月香……
    李排长给全班三十六个红卫兵小将每人准备好了一份最宝贵的“礼物”。一条条语录一颗颗心，解放军和红卫兵亲又亲！
