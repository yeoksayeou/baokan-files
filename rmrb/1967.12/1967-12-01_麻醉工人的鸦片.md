The Chinese Khrushchev, harboring the wolf-like ambition to usurp the Party and the country, has relentlessly seized the labor movement as his battleground. For a long time, he has been pushing a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the labor movement, using every possible means to inject revisionist poison into the ranks of the working class.

The Chinese Khrushchev puts on a hypocritical face, claiming over and over again that he is fighting for the "immediate interests of the workers." What exactly are these immediate interests of the workers that he is concerned about? In a word, he is leading the workers to focus on everything from an economic perspective, to put money first, to calculate within their personal circles, and to flip around in the copper coin eye. This black line in the labor movement has poisoned our broad ranks of trade union cadres, causing many of them to not take proletarian politics as the command, nor take socialism as the driving force, to seize the revolution and promote production. Instead, they spend the whole day running around for "a few tickets and a few fees"—whether it's money tickets, theater tickets, or sports tickets; whether it's haircut fees, bath fees... countless in variety, too many to list. As a result, they have lost the political center, lost their class soul, and turned the trade unions into Petőfi Clubs.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are the three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state." "Throughout the transitional period, there are class contradictions, there is class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism." Therefore, the most fundamental interest of the working class is to insist on the class struggle to eliminate the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat, to insist on the dictatorship of the proletariat, to prevent the restoration of capitalism, and to carry the socialist revolution through to the end. Otherwise, the working class will not be liberated, and after seizing power, there is still the danger of losing it.

The so-called "fighting for the immediate interests of the workers" by the Chinese Khrushchev is an opium that anesthetizes the workers, a poison disguised as candy. The working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought must follow our great leader Chairman Mao to make revolution for life and never fall for the tricks of the Chinese Khrushchev!

    麻醉工人的鸦片
    海燎原金属品厂造反队员　吴林生
    中国赫鲁晓夫，怀着篡党、篡国的狼子野心，拚命抓住工运这个阵地，长期以来，推行了一条反革命修正主义的工运路线，千方百计地在工人阶级队伍中灌输修正主义毒素。
    中国赫鲁晓夫摆出一副伪善的面孔，口口声声说要为“工人的切身生活而斗争”，他所关心的工人切身生活，究竟是些什么货色呢？一句话，就是引导工人一切从经济着眼，钞票挂帅，在个人圈子里打算盘，铜钱眼里翻筋斗。这条工运黑线，毒害了我们广大的工会干部，使许多人不是以无产阶级政治为统帅，以社会主义为动力，抓革命，促生产，而是整天为“几票几费”奔波，什么钞票、戏票、球票；什么剃头费、洗澡费……形形色色，名目繁多，举不胜举。结果丢掉了政治中心，失去了阶级灵魂，把工会办成了裴多菲俱乐部。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动”。“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。”因此，我们工人阶级最根本的利益就是坚持灭资兴无的阶级斗争，坚持无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，把社会主义革命进行到底。不然的话，我们工人阶级就不能获得解放，夺取了政权以后仍然有失去政权的危险。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所谓为“工人切身生活而斗争”是一剂麻醉工人的鸦片，是裹着糖衣的砒霜。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，就是要紧跟我们伟大领袖毛主席闹一辈子革命，决不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当！
