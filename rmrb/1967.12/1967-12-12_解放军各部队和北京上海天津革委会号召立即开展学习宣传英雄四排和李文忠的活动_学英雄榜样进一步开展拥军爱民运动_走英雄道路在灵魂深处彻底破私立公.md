The PLA units in Guangzhou, Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuhan, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Kunming, and the party committees and leadership organs of the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions have recently issued decisions or notices, calling on all officers and soldiers in their respective units to immediately and extensively launch a campaign to learn from the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Comrade Li Wenzhong. They are to take these heroes as examples, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and unconditionally execute every battle command of Chairman Mao. They are to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The decisions and notices point out that at this decisive moment of victory in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the conferring of the honorable titles of "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" to the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the 601st Division of the People's Liberation Army, and "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" to Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong. This is a great concern, encouragement, inspiration, and motivation from Chairman Mao to the entire military and civilian population of the nation. It sets a shining example for the nation's military and civilians to break with selfishness and establish public spirit, transform their worldviews, achieve ideological revolutionization, and build a new world.

The decisions and notices say, "Navigating the vast sea requires a helmsman; conducting revolution requires Mao Zedong Thought." The emergence of the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong is the result of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in the hearts of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in our army. Learning from the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, the most fundamental thing is to firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, take "criticizing selfishness and revisionism" as the key link, and strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, promote ideological revolutionization, and firmly establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Always follow Chairman Mao closely, never leave Chairman Mao, and implement Chairman Mao's words to the letter.

The decisions and notices say that learning from the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, we must firmly implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "the People's Liberation Army should support the leftist broad masses" and "protect the leftists," and further carry out the "Support the Army, Love the People" movement. Officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines of "three supports, two militaries" should take the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong as shining examples, firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, always maintain a humble and prudent style, firmly believe in and rely on the masses, be the students of the masses, support and help the revolutionary leftists and the broad revolutionary masses, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary tripartite alliances, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The decisions and notices require all units to immediately launch a large-scale propaganda campaign, using all forms of propaganda and seizing every opportunity to quickly spread the good news of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin personally approving the conferring of honorable titles to the Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, as well as the deeds of the heroes, to every organization and company, every guard post and border sentry, every officer and soldier, every staff member and family member, truly achieving household familiarity and deep penetration.

The revolutionary committees of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin have respectively issued decisions and notices, warmly hailing the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally approving the conferring of the honorable titles of "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" to the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the 601st Division and Comrade Li Wenzhong. They call on revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and the broad revolutionary masses to act immediately, extensively, and deeply to launch learning and propaganda activities, hoist high the great banner of "Support the Army, Love the People," closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and unswervingly follow the course charted by Chairman Mao to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The decisions and notices of the revolutionary committees of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin point out that learning from the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, we must be the most loyal good soldiers of Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Like the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, "Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao instructs me, I implement; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance."

The decisions and notices emphasize that learning from the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, we must pour our deep affection for Chairman Mao into studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and into actual actions of closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. For every strategic deployment and every battle command of Chairman Mao, we must firmly believe, carefully understand, closely follow, and strictly implement.

The decisions and notices point out that learning from the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, we must, like them, consciously break with selfishness and establish public spirit, transform our worldviews, and achieve ideological revolutionization. Breaking with selfishness means breaking at the crucial point; establishing public spirit means establishing at the root. We must emphasize politics, grasp the key points, thoroughly break with all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois selfish thoughts that hinder us from deeply understanding and firmly implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions, thoroughly uproot the foundation of the "self" in our minds, and build a great wall of proletarian "public" spirit.

The decisions and notices point out that the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong are typical representatives of the great image of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Their heroic deeds once again show that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and a great wall that can be completely trusted and relied upon. Learning from the hero Fourth Platoon and Li Wenzhong, we must unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on "Support the Army, Love the People." All revolutionary leftists and revolutionary masses must seriously learn from the People's Liberation Army, unite with the People's Liberation Army, fight with the People's Liberation Army, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
