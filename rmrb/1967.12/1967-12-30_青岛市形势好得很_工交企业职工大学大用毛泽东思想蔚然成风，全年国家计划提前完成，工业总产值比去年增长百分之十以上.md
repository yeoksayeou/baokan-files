The industrial and transportation enterprises in Qingdao have made great strides in studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought, creating a strong trend. The annual national plan was completed three days ahead of schedule, with the total industrial output value increasing by more than 10% compared to last year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 29th — The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation front in Qingdao have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, and vigorously promoted revolution and production. They completed the annual national plan three days ahead of schedule. The total industrial output value of the city increased by more than 10% compared to last year. The production of major products such as steel, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, machine tools, fertilizers, gasoline engines, pesticides, machine-made paper, matches, soap, bicycles, and sewing machines all saw significant increases. The quality of most products has been stabilized and improved, and costs have been reduced. Transportation and logistics have basically met the needs of industrial and agricultural production development. For example, the port's cargo throughput increased by more than 16% compared to last year.

The revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation front in Qingdao, with deep class feelings of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They deeply understood that:

1. Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, and promoting the ideological transformation of people is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of grasping revolution and promoting production.

	"Navigating the great ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Revolutionary workers on the industrial and transportation front in Qingdao study Chairman Mao's instructions before work, accept Chairman Mao's commands during work, and review Chairman Mao's instructions after work. In industrial and transportation enterprises, the trend of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought extensively has become prevalent. Comrade Lin Biao said, "When the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they become the wisest and bravest, and can unleash boundless strength!" Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary workers of the Qingdao Salt Administration have created a new set of technologies, breaking away from the backward appearance of the salt fields. They not only completed the national plan in excess but also increased the rate of first-grade salt from 17% to over 99%.

2. Firmly grasping the direction of struggle, closely linking the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of one's own unit, and breaking and establishing, is a powerful driving force for grasping revolution and promoting production.

	Chairman Mao taught us, "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. With destruction as the priority, construction is also within it." The proletarian revolutionary factions on the industrial and transportation front in Qingdao, under the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, have criticized the capitalist reactionary line represented by Liu Shaoqi, raised their class consciousness, and firmly established the socialist direction. The steel pipe workshop of the Qingdao Steel Plant previously implemented the "production quota to the team," evaluating and rewarding production monthly, resulting in individualism, lack of cooperation, and "monthly evaluation, monthly reward," which affected unity and production. Through the great criticism, the masses abolished this revisionist system and established a new order of three shifts creating conditions for each other, promoting each other, and continuous production. The workers' spiritual outlook improved, and production efficiency leaped to new heights, setting new production records since the factory's establishment.

3. Strengthening the revolutionary construction of the production command team and establishing and improving the production command system at all levels is an important condition for the victory of grasping revolution and promoting production.

	After the proletarian revolutionary factions in various units of Qingdao seized power, they quickly formed production leading teams according to the principle of the three-in-one combination. Units that have not yet achieved revolutionary unity have also elected representatives from various revolutionary mass organizations to form temporary production command teams, ensuring the normal operation of production through unified command.

	The members of the production command teams, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an official and a common person," have thoroughly transformed their work style and closely connected with the masses, greatly promoting the development of various work items. The Four-Wheel Locomotive and Vehicle Factory and the Casting Machinery Factory have turned the "production scheduling meeting" into a meeting for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide business and production, greatly promoting the development of various work items and production. Since the establishment of the production command department, the Qingdao Railway Bureau has maintained that two-thirds of the personnel and two-thirds of the time are spent on-site, participating in labor, listening to opinions, and helping to solve production problems.

The People's Liberation Army, which is carrying out the "support industry" mission in Qingdao, has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and made significant contributions to helping the proletarian revolutionary factions seize power and use it well, and to achieving the victory of grasping revolution and promoting production, establishing new merits.

### 青岛市形势好得很  工交企业职工大学大用毛泽东思想蔚然成风，全年国家计划提前完成，工业总产值比去年增长百分之十以上

    青岛市形势好得很
    工交企业职工大学大用毛泽东思想蔚然成风，全年国家计划提前完成，工业总产值比去年增长百分之十以上
    据新华社济南二十九日电　青岛市工交战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前三天完成了全年国家计划。全市工业总产值比去年增长百分之十以上。钢材、棉纱、棉布、机床、化肥、汽油机、农药、机制纸、火柴、肥皂、自行车、缝纫机等主要产品的产量，都比去年有较大幅度的增长。大部分产品质量稳定提高，成本下降。交通运输也基本上适应了工农业生产发展的需要，其中港口吞吐量就比去年增长百分之十六以上。
    青岛市工交战线上的革命干部和广大革命职工，怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。他们深深体会到：
    一、用战无不胜的毛泽东思想统帅一切，活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化，这是抓革命、促生产获得胜利的根本保证。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。青岛市工交战线的广大革命职工班前学习毛主席的指示，接受毛主席的命令；班中运用毛主席的指示，听毛主席的指挥；班后对照毛主席的指示，接受毛主席的检查。在工交企业中，大学大用毛泽东思想蔚然成风。林彪同志说：“人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！”青岛盐务局的革命职工，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，大造旧设备、旧工艺、旧制度的反，创造了一套新工艺，摆脱了盐场的落后面貌，不仅超额完成了国家计划，而且原盐一等盐率由过去的百分之十七提高到百分之九十九以上。
    二、紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把革命大批判和本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，大破大立，是抓革命、促生产的强大推动力。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”青岛市工交战线的无产阶级革命派高举革命批判大旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，批判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线，提高了阶级觉悟，坚定了社会主义方向。青岛钢厂钢管车间过去实行“包产到班”，每月按产量评比发奖，结果搞的各自为政，互不协作，“月评月奖”，成了“越评越僵”，影响团结，影响生产。经过革命大批判，群众废除了“包产到班”这个修正主义的制度，建立起三班互创条件，互相促进，连续生产的新秩序，职工精神面貌一新，生产效率一跃再跃，连创建厂以来的生产新纪录。
    三、狠抓生产指挥班子的革命化建设，建立健全各级生产指挥系统，是抓革命、促生产取得胜利的重要条件。
    青岛市各单位的无产阶级革命派夺权后，都较快地按照革命三结合原则，组成了生产领导班子，暂时尚未实现革命大联合的单位，也由各革命群众组织推选代表组成临时生产指挥班子，对生产实行统一指挥，有效地保证了生产的正常进行。
    生产指挥班子的成员，按照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，彻底转变作风，密切联系群众，从而大大促进了各项工作的开展。四方机车车辆厂、铸造机械厂等单位把“生产调度会”变成了活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会，以毛泽东思想统帅业务、统帅生产，大大推动各项工作和生产的发展。青岛铁路分局自生产指挥部建立以来，一直保持了三分之二的人员、三分之二的时间深入现场，参加劳动，听取意见，帮助解决生产问题。
    在青岛市执行“支工”任务的人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在帮助无产阶级革命派掌好权用好权和取得抓革命促生产的胜利中作出了重大贡献，立下了新功勋。
