Our Dazhai Production Brigade has stood up through the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we Dazhai people have raised the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

Comrade Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of our great leader Chairman Mao, said: "We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and infuse Mao Zedong Thought into the workers and peasants, so as to change the spiritual outlook of the laboring people, and turn spiritual force into a great material force." This truth is being deeply felt by the people of Dazhai today more than ever before.

This year, political awareness among the people of Dazhai has risen the fastest, and it has also been a year of bumper harvests in production. As early as February this year, inspired by Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," we decided to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture and report good news to the great leader Chairman Mao. Our wish has indeed come true. The total grain output of the entire brigade has increased by 56.1 percent compared to last year, and by 12.1 percent compared to the highest production year of 1964.

The greatest achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our Dazhai is the further improvement in the political and ideological level of the masses. We have thoroughly criticized the poisonous influence of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents against Dazhai, and have seen more clearly the crimes of the capitalist roadline. We have more firmly believed in the victory of following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have never been as clear as they are now: following Chairman Mao's socialist road will surely lead to victory, eternal victory.

Now, every adult and child in Dazhai can enthusiastically tell you a lot of stories that are both fresh and inspiring. They will tell you that the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai have four self-awarenesses: voluntarily studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; voluntarily criticizing and repudiating revisionism and capitalism; voluntarily participating in collective labor; and voluntarily implementing political leadership in grain distribution. Every time the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai hear Chairman Mao's great instructions, the first thing they think of is to carry them out resolutely, word for word.

The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought has made the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Dazhai think not only of Dazhai Brigade but also of the whole commune, the whole county, the whole province, the whole country, and the class brothers all over the world. During the summer harvest distribution this year, the first year's trial planting of high-yielding peas in our brigade yielded a bumper harvest. However, the members did not want to eat them. Except for leaving two catties for the brigade as seeds, the rest were all sent to support the brother brigades for promotion. "Wait until all the people in the county have eaten peas, and then the people of Dazhai will eat!" This is the unanimous idea of Comrade Chen Yonggui and all the members of Dazhai.

"We rely on the helmsman to sail the vast ocean, and we rely on Mao Zedong Thought to carry out the revolution." We Dazhai people deeply understand: it is because of Chairman Mao that there is Dazhai, and it is because of Mao Zedong Thought that there is Dazhai. In the new year, we must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp the revolution, and promote production, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 毛泽东思想转化为巨大的物质力量。请看：  大寨一年的最大成果

    毛泽东思想转化为巨大的物质力量。请看：
    大寨一年的最大成果
    昔阳县大寨大队党支部委员　郭凤莲
    我们大寨大队是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想翻了身的。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们大寨人把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，又提高到了一个崭新的水平。
    伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席说：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”这一个千真万确的真理，今天的大寨人体会得比任何时候都深刻。
    今年，是大寨人的政治觉悟提高得最快的一年，也是生产上获得特大丰收的一年。早在今年二月，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的鼓舞下，我们就下决心，一定要争取农业大丰收，向伟大的领袖毛主席报喜。我们的愿望果真实现了，全大队的粮食总产量比去年增长了百分之五十六点一，比历史上产量最高的一九六四年增长了百分之十二点一。
    无产阶级文化大革命在我们大寨收到的最大的成果，是广大社员政治思想上的进一步提高。我们彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人反大寨的流毒，更加认清了资产阶级反动路线的罪行，更加坚定了紧跟毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利信心。广大贫下中农比过去任何时候都清楚地看到：跟着毛主席走社会主义的康庄大道，就必然会胜利，永远胜利。
    现在大寨的每个大人和孩子，都会兴致勃勃地向你说一大堆使你听了既觉得新鲜而又振奋的故事。他们会告诉你，我们大寨的贫下中农有四个自觉：自觉地活学活用毛主席著作；自觉地斗私批修；自觉地积极参加集体劳动；自觉地在口粮分配中实行政治挂帅。我们大寨的贫下中农每逢听到毛主席的伟大指示，首先想到的就是坚决执行，句句照办。
    光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想大普及，使我们大寨的广大贫下中农心里想的不光是一个大寨大队，而是全社、全县、全省、全国以及全世界的阶级弟兄。在今年夏收分配的时候，我们大队第一年试种的优种豌豆获得了大丰收。但是社员们舍不得吃，除了给队上留下两斤作种子，其余全部支援了兄弟队作为推广用的种子。“等全县人民都吃上了豌豆，大寨人再吃！”这是陈永贵同志和全大寨社员的一致想法。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们大寨人深深懂得：有了毛主席才有大寨，有了毛泽东思想才有大寨。在新的一年里，我们一定要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利。
