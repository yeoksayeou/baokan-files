The victory of the Cultural Revolution echoes across the Jizhong Plain

The Revolutionary Committee of Shijiazhuang Region has been established. Ninety-nine percent of the units in Shijiazhuang City have achieved revolutionary great unity, and more than forty-eight percent of the units have achieved revolutionary three-in-one combination; eleven counties in the region have established revolutionary committees; agriculture has seen a bumper harvest, and industrial output value has been continuously increasing.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, December 8th: Under the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, after more than a year of intense and complex class struggle, the situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the industrial and agricultural production in Shijiazhuang Region, Hebei Province, is excellent and getting better. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely propagated and disseminated, Mao Zedong's revolutionary line is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people, and the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong's works is surging to new heights. Revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great unity, and revolutionary three-in-one combination are developing smoothly. Urban and rural industrial and agricultural production is thriving.

Recently, the vast Jizhong Plain has brought good news: the Revolutionary Committee of Shijiazhuang Region has been established. This is an important sign of the unprecedentedly good revolutionary situation in Shijiazhuang Region.

Over the past year, the five million revolutionary people in the region have responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end," and have actively participated in the magnificent revolutionary struggle. The masses have been fully mobilized. Whether in factories, rural areas, offices, schools, or the military, everywhere people are discussing the Cultural Revolution, and everyone is concerned about state affairs. The broad revolutionary masses have an unlimited love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They use Mao Zedong Thought to measure their words and actions, to see if their words and actions are in line with Chairman Mao's teachings, and have firmly established in their minds the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses in the region, in order to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, have launched a thorough and extensive revolutionary criticism against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Shijiazhuang Region, and have closely combined the criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform in their local areas and units. Now, the reactionary face of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the Shijiazhuang Region has been thoroughly exposed, and they have been overthrown. The revolutionary criticism has promoted revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. Various revolutionary mass organizations and the broad revolutionary masses have quickly united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, by system, by department, and by group. Ninety-nine percent of the units in Shijiazhuang City have achieved revolutionary great unity, and successively established workers' congresses, peasants' congresses, red congresses, and workers' congresses in the railway system. Furthermore, more than forty-eight percent of the units have established temporary power organs of revolutionary three-in-one combination. Among the seventeen counties in the region, thirteen have achieved revolutionary great unity, and eleven have established revolutionary committees.

The broad revolutionary masses have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and have vigorously grasped revolution and vigorously promoted production, achieving double victories in revolution and production. After the summer bumper harvest, the region's agricultural production has again seen a bumper harvest in autumn. The total output and average yield per acre of cotton have both exceeded last year's. After the autumn harvest, autumn plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy projects have been carried out in waves. The industrial production situation is also good. The total industrial output value of Shijiazhuang City, from January to October, has completed 82.1% of the annual plan, an increase of 8.55% over the same period last year; the output in the first decade of November increased by 33.2% compared to the previous month; and in the middle of November, it increased by 12.4% compared to the beginning of the month. Twenty-five major products, including raw coal, coke, and steel, have all increased compared to last year. Now, more than twenty factories and enterprises in the city have completed or overfulfilled the state's annual production plan.

The unprecedentedly good situation of revolution and production in the Shijiazhuang Region is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past year, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become increasingly widespread and profound. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become the conscious actions of the revolutionary masses in cities and countryside. From factories, offices, schools, and stores to rural production teams, and even many workers' and peasants' families, have established the system of reading Chairman Mao's works every day. After Chairman Mao issued the great battle call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," it has further inspired the learning enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses in the region. They have taken "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights. More than ten thousand cadres and masses in Shijiazhuang City have participated in the study classes.

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Shijiazhuang Region have made great contributions and established immortal merits in the Cultural Revolution of the Shijiazhuang Region. The broad officers and soldiers have widely propagated Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, firmly established the absolute authority of the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought, helped the revolutionary masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and greatly strengthened the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the revolutionary masses.

    据新华社保定八日电　在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，经过一年多来尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，河北省石家庄地区的无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产形势一片大好，越来越好。战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到了空前的大普及、大传播，毛主席的革命路线越来越深入人心，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新高潮，革命的大批判、革命的大联合和革命的三结合正在顺利地向前发展，城乡工农业生产蒸蒸日上。
    最近，辽阔的冀中平原传来了振奋人心的喜讯，石家庄地区革命委员会成立了。这是石家庄地区革命形势空前大好的一个重要标志。
    一年多来，全区五百万革命人民响应伟大领袖毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，积极投入到轰轰烈烈的革命斗争中去，广大群众充分发动起来了。不论是工厂、农村、机关、学校、部队，到处都在谈论文化大革命的问题，人人都在关心国家大事。广大革命群众对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席的革命路线无限热爱，无限忠诚，他们用毛泽东思想来衡量自己的言论和行动，看自己的言论和行动是不是符合毛主席的教导，在头脑中牢固地树立了伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，树立了伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    全区无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在石家庄地区的代理人，展开了广泛深入的革命大批判，并且把大批判和本地区、本单位的斗批改紧密地结合了起来。现在，石家庄地区党内一小撮走资派的反动面目已经彻底暴露，他们已经垮台了。革命的大批判促进了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。各革命群众组织和广大革命群众，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，按系统、按部门、按班组迅速地联合起来。石家庄市百分之九十九的单位实现了革命的大联合，相继成立了工代会、农代会、红代会和铁路系统的工代会，并且有百分之四十八以上的单位建立了革命三结合的临时权力机构。在全区十七个县中，已经有十三个县实现革命大联合，其中十一个县成立了革命委员会。

    人民解放军驻石家庄地区部队广大指战员，在石家庄地区的文化大革命中作出了巨大贡献，立下了不朽功勋。广大指战员广泛地宣传毛主席的伟大革命实践，大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，帮助革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，大大加强了革命群众的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
