The Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress has been conducted well. It has effectively promoted revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination. Cadres and the masses have worked together to criticize and repudiate revisionism, strengthening the unity among revolutionary old and new cadres and between revolutionary cadres and the masses.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 13th, the Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, with "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as its guiding principle, has actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and works. It has focused on practical application, effectively promoting the consolidation and development of revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination.

More than 700 revolutionary mass organization leaders and revolutionary cadres from over 300 factories and enterprises participated in this study class. Most of these units have already achieved revolutionary great unity. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles," emphasizing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought as the key to successfully conducting the study class.

Some leaders of revolutionary mass organizations initially had oppositional sentiments. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the lack of fundamental conflicts of interest within the working class and the necessity for unity within the proletarian dictatorship. They recognized that the revolutionary masses in the opposing organizations are their class brothers, and that both sides should help and learn from each other, directing their efforts against the capitalist-roaders within the Party led by China's Khrushchev. They understood that revolutionary great unity is a guarantee for the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieve new victories in revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination, and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the prominent marks that distinguish us from other parties." The study class, following Chairman Mao's teaching, especially emphasized self-criticism. Many leaders of the two factions in various units, during the study, focused on others' strengths, actively examined their own shortcomings and mistakes, and consolidated and developed revolutionary great unity from the ideological level. Leaders of the two factions in the Beijing Iron Alloy Factory, during the study, seriously engaged in self-criticism, actively criticized and repudiated their own selfishness, and severely criticized petty-bourgeois factionalism. The more they criticized their selfishness, the more they felt they had wronged their class brothers. Upon returning to the factory, they did ideological work among the masses, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity by production teams. Many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations believed that self-criticism is a major sign of conscious revolution and self-liberation. Only by seriously engaging in self-criticism can one truly overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness. In self-criticism, one should not only expose the selfishness known to others but also the selfishness unknown to others, uprooting selfishness completely.

The study class adopted a method combining in-class and out-of-class, and in-factory and out-of-factory activities, applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and works while studying them, achieving immediate results, helping and promoting each other, and appropriately arranging time for students to return to their units to share their learning experiences and insights, connect with reality, and solve problems. Leaders of the two factions in the Beijing Smelting Plant studied and criticized their selfishness simultaneously, basically reaching an agreement. However, they later encountered obstacles on some minor issues. At this time, more than ten brother units' leaders of the two factions in the study class treated the Smelting Plant's affairs as their own, providing enthusiastic help. They invited other core members of the two factions from this plant to the study class, together criticizing and repudiating their selfishness, finally achieving revolutionary great unity.

Leaders of the two factions of revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary cadres studying and criticizing their selfishness together have greatly promoted the unity among revolutionary old and new cadres and between revolutionary cadres and the masses. Many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, through study, had heart-to-heart talks with revolutionary cadres, severely criticizing the three fears regarding cadres: fearing wrongful liberation, others seizing small faults, and being labeled as "royalists"; fearing cadres retaliating later; and fearing not becoming leaders. They established three beliefs: believing that the majority of cadres are good or relatively good, believing in the opposing revolutionary mass organization, and believing that the broad revolutionary masses can correctly treat cadres. Some revolutionary cadres also exposed their selfish thoughts, expressing their determination to firmly believe in the masses, correctly treat themselves, and resolutely serve the people as humble servants, following Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life.

The Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, organized in military platoon formation, combined political and military training. This has played an active role in overcoming anarchism and other non-proletarian thoughts, and strengthening revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline.

　　北京市工代会毛泽东思想学习班办得好
　　有力地促进了革命的大联合和三结合
　　干部和群众一起斗私批修，加强了革命的新老干部、革命干部和群众之间的团结
    据新华社十三日讯　北京市工代会举办的毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席的最新指示和毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，有力地促进了革命大联合、革命三结合的巩固和发展。
    参加这个学习班的有三百多个工厂企业的七百多名革命群众组织负责人和革命干部。这些单位，绝大多数已经实现了革命的大联合。他们反复学习了毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”，把大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，做为办好学习班的关键的关键，根本的根本。
    一些单位革命群众组织的负责人，开始学习时，有对立情绪。他们认真学习了毛主席关于“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的教导，认识到对方组织的革命群众是自己的阶级兄弟，双方应该互相帮助，互相学习，共同把矛头对准以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派。革命的大联合，是无产阶级革命派夺取无产阶级文化大革命胜利的保证。他们表示，一定要在大好的革命形势下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在革命大联合和革命三结合中立新功，誓做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”学习班遵照毛主席的这一教导，特别强调多做自我批评。许多单位的两派革命群众组织负责人，在学习中多看别人的优点，主动检查自己的缺点、错误，从思想上巩固和发展了革命的大联合。北京铁合金厂两派组织的负责人，在学习中都认真做自我批评，主动斗私，狠批小资产阶级派性。双方越斗私越感到对不起自己的阶级兄弟，回厂后各做群众的思想工作，很快在全厂实现了按班组的革命大联合。许多革命群众组织负责人认为，自我批评是自觉革命、自己解放自己的主要标志之一。认真做自我批评，才能从思想上真正斗倒私字，树立公字。在自我批评中，不但要亮别人知道的私，更要亮别人不知道的私，把私字连根拔掉。
    学习班采取班内班外、厂内厂外结合的方法，对毛主席的最新指示和毛主席著作边学边用，立竿见影，互相帮助，互相促进，并适当安排时间让学员回本单位谈学习心得和体会，联系实际，解决问题。北京冶炼厂两派组织的负责人边学习，边斗私，双方基本上达成了协议。但是，后来又在一些枝节问题上“卡壳”了。这时，在学习班的十多个兄弟单位的两派革命群众组织负责人都把冶炼厂的事当作自己的事，给予热情的帮助。他们邀请这个厂两派的其他核心成员到学习班来，一起亮私斗私，终于实现了革命的大联合。
    两派革命群众组织负责人和革命干部一起学习，一起斗私，这样做对加强革命的新老干部、革命干部和群众之间的团结，有很大的促进作用。许多革命群众组织的负责人通过学习，和革命干部一起谈心，狠斗了在干部问题上的三怕：一怕解放错了，别人抓小辫子，当“保皇派”；二怕干部往后再给自己穿小鞋；三怕当不上头头。树立了三相信：相信绝大多数干部是好的和比较好的，相信对方革命群众组织，相信广大革命群众能正确对待干部。一些革命干部也亮了自己的私心杂念，表示要坚决相信群众，正确对待自己，决心永远当人民的勤务员，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
    北京市工代会举办的毛泽东思想学习班按军事排班编制，实行政治训练和军事训练相结合，对克服无政府主义等非无产阶级思想，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，也起了积极作用。
