The revolutionary and production situation in Heilongjiang Province is unprecedentedly good and getting better. From the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the banks of the Songhua River, from the foothills of the Changbai Mountains to the Sanjiang Plain, everywhere is a scene of revolutionary fervor. The broad masses of the people have been fully mobilized, everyone is concerned about national affairs, and men, women, old, and young have all joined the torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The industrial and agricultural production front is also reporting good news and singing victory songs.

In the midst of Heilongjiang Province's excellent situation, the most inspiring and most significant development is the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pushed the province's mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. The scale of the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, the number of participants, their awareness, and the effectiveness are all unprecedented. Since May this year, the province has held lectures on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works from the bottom up, with over six million people participating. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres regard studying Chairman Mao's works as their primary need in life, placing it above everything else, greater than everything else, before everything else, and more important than everything else. Their first act every day is to salute Chairman Mao and wish him eternal life, their first song is to sing "The East Is Red," and their first activity is to study Chairman Mao's works. Throughout the province's cities and countryside, Chairman Mao's glorious image is everywhere, Chairman Mao's quotations are ubiquitous, and Chairman Mao's quotation songs can be heard at any time. The broad revolutionary masses study Chairman Mao's works, closely linking them with the current struggle, learning and applying them in the midst of class struggle. They use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon to carry out revolutionary criticism and rectification in their units, developing and consolidating revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination. They link their personal thoughts and work with national affairs, with the direction of the struggle, and with implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, elevating the struggle against selfishness and for the public good to the level of the struggle between the two lines, achieving new heights in both learning and application.

After the great call by the great leader Chairman Mao to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the entire province has responded enthusiastically. Various levels of revolutionary committees and units in the army, government agencies, schools, factories, stores, and rural production teams have set up over 46,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various forms, with over 1.8 million people participating in the study. Self-organized part-time study classes are ubiquitous in cities and countryside. Now, most of the study classes have completed their second term. The widespread establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes has brought about a new situation in the province's massive movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

The excellent situation in Heilongjiang Province is also reflected in the continuous consolidation and development of the revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs. The "new dawn of the Northeast," born in the January Revolution storm, is shining brilliantly. Currently, out of the 82 cities, prefectures, and counties in the province, except for two cities and one county that are in the process of establishing revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs, all the rest have established revolutionary committees. The revolutionary committees at all levels are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking the counter-revolutionary revisionist line pushed by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in all work, and establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, transform everything, promote everything, and measure everything. The members of the revolutionary committees at all levels, following Chairman Mao's teachings to "serve the people wholeheartedly" and "to adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be a student of the masses," carry Chairman Mao's works with them, appear in the forefront of revolution and production in the guise of ordinary laborers, and have established a deep bond with the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary committees at all levels firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, fiercely criticize and combat China's Khrushchev and his agents in Heilongjiang Province, pushing the wave of revolutionary criticism higher and higher, and the historical tide of revolutionary great unity surges forward. The province has established a new order of revolution and production, and the dictatorship of the proletariat has been further consolidated.

Under the great banner of Chairman Mao's "grasp revolution, promote production," the industrial and agricultural production situation in Heilongjiang Province is also excellent. The province's industrial production is continuously improving, with some factories and enterprises having completed their annual national plans ahead of schedule and exceeding the targets. Some factories have also developed and produced some new products urgently needed by the state. The province's coal production has increased significantly in the past few months, and the railway transportation situation is also good. This year, the province's agricultural production has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. Currently, the broad masses of farmers are enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state while launching a high tide of preparation for spring farming.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." The excellent situation in Heilongjiang Province is inseparable from the great support of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The broad officers and soldiers of the Heilongjiang Military Region and the stationed troops have made outstanding contributions in the "three supports, two militaries" work. They have passed on the three-eight style and the four firsts to the broad revolutionary masses, armed the revolutionary masses with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and forged a combat friendship with the broad revolutionary masses in the midst of class struggle. Now, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in Heilongjiang Province, learning from the heroic deeds of the "model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people" and the "model for supporting the left and loving the people" Li Wenzhong, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, extensively and deeply carrying out the activities of fighting selfishness, criticizing revisionism, and supporting the army and loving the people, accelerating the revolutionization of thought. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, seize the comprehensive and thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    “东北的新曙光”放射出灿烂光辉
    黑龙江革命生产热火朝天
    毛泽东思想学习班遍及城乡各地，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动波澜壮阔
    据新华社哈尔滨二十八日电　黑龙江省无产阶级文化大革命和工农业生产形势空前大好，越来越好。从黑龙江边到松花江畔，从完达山麓到三江平原，到处是热火朝天的革命景象，广大人民群众充分发动起来了，人人关心国家大事，男女老少都投入了无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，工农业生产战线也喜报频传，凯歌阵阵。
    在黑龙江省一片大好形势中，最最振奋人心、最最具有深远意义的是毛泽东思想的大普及、大传播。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，把全省活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了一个新阶段。学习毛主席著作的群众运动声势之大，参加学习的人数之多、自觉性之高、效果之好都是前所未有的。今年五月以来，全省范围内自下而上层层召开了活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，参加讲用会的人数就有六百多万人。广大工农兵群众、红卫兵小将和革命干部把学习毛主席著作当作生活的第一需要，放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。他们每天第一件事是向毛主席敬礼，敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，第一支歌是高唱《东方红》，第一次活动是学习毛主席著作。在全省城乡，毛主席的光辉形象到处可见，毛主席语录牌比比皆是，毛主席语录歌随时可闻。广大革命群众学习毛主席著作，紧密联系当前实际斗争，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里学，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里用，他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合；他们把个人的思想和工作同国家大事联系起来，同斗争的大方向联系起来，同执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线联系起来，把破私立公提高到两条路线斗争的高度，学出了新水平，用出了新水平。
    伟大统帅毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，全省上下闻风而动，各级革命委员会和部队、机关、学校、工厂、商店、农村生产大队，办起各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班四万六千多个，已有一百八十多万人参加了学习，群众自办的业余学习班遍及城乡。现在，大多数学习班已办完第二期。毛泽东思想学习班的大量兴办，使全省波澜壮阔的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了一个新局面。
    黑龙江省大好形势还表现在革命的三结合临时权力机构的不断巩固和发展。在“一月革命”风暴中诞生的“东北的新曙光”，放射着灿烂的光辉。目前，全省八十二个市、专区、县，除有两市一县正在酝酿成立革命三结合临时权力机构以外，其余全部建立了革命委员会。各级革命委员会高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在各项工作中大破党内一小撮走资派推行的反革命修正主义路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，自觉地用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切，推动一切，衡量一切。各级革命委员会的委员遵照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”，“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，带着毛主席著作，以普通劳动者姿态，出现在革命和生产第一线，和革命群众建立了鱼水相依的关系。各级革命委员会紧紧掌握斗争大方向，狠批猛斗中国赫鲁晓夫和他在黑龙江省的代理人，推动革命大批判的浪潮一浪高过一浪，革命大联合的历史潮流滚滚向前，全省建立了革命、生产新秩序，无产阶级专政更加巩固。
    在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针指引下，黑龙江省的工农业生产形势也是一片大好。全省工业生产不断提高，有些工厂企业已提前超额完成了全年国家计划，有的工厂还试制和生产了一些国家急需的新产品。全省煤炭产量近几个月来大幅度上升，铁路交通运输形势也大好。今年全省农业生产获得了空前未有的特大丰收。目前，广大农村社员在踊跃向国家卖余粮的同时，掀起了备耕生产的高潮。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”黑龙江省大好形势的出现，是与中国人民解放军的大力支援分不开的。黑龙江省军区和驻军的广大指战员在“三支”“两军”工作中作出了卓越贡献。他们把三八作风、四个第一传给广大革命群众，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装革命群众，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里与广大革命群众结下了战斗的友谊。现在，黑龙江省广大军民，正在学习“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志的英雄业绩，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，广泛深入地开展斗私批修和拥军爱民活动，加速思想革命化。他们决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面彻底胜利。
