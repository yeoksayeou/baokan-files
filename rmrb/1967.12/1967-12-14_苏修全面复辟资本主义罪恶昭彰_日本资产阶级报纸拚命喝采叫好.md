The Soviet revisionist leadership's heinous crime of fully and thoroughly restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union has been praised by imperialists and reactionaries of various countries. Japanese bourgeois newspapers' correspondents in Moscow have recently continuously reported on the capitalist phenomena in various fields of Soviet society today. From the cheers of the bourgeois press, one can also see how the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique have ruined the Soviet Union. This bunch of traitors of the October Revolution will not escape the severe judgment of history!

The Japanese newspaper *Yomiuri Shimbun* recently praised in a report that Brezhnev and Kosygin's "socialism" is only "different in name, but similar in content" compared to capitalism.

The report praised Brezhnev and Kosygin for implementing the "principle of profit," saying that "the scope of profit-making is continuously expanding" and "money comes first."

The report said, "Since the profit method is adopted, long-term planning becomes increasingly difficult. Just like in capitalism, one has to look at the profits of enterprises and the trends of national consumption in each period to continuously adjust the economy."

The Japanese newspaper *Tokyo Shimbun* praised the Soviet "privileged class" for implementing a new economic policy of "profit first and liberalization."

This newspaper said, "The gap in living standards among the people has widened." "In Moscow, during the summer when tomatoes are in season, they sell for two rubles per kilogram. ... A basic-level worker has to pay an entire day's wages to buy one kilogram of tomatoes. However, in high-end restaurants, the tables are piled high with such expensive tomatoes, and those with high salaries enjoy luxurious banquets for half a day."

According to *Yomiuri Shimbun*, "In Moscow, there is a street called 'Seagull Street.' This is not a street actually named 'Seagull Street,' but it is named so because the highest-level 'Seagull' cars that Soviet high-ranking officials love to use often pass through this street. The black 'Seagull' cars, with new curtains hanging in the back windows, appear anywhere, and as soon as the police whistle blows, all people and vehicles must stop to make way for these cars. In such a situation, these cars speed away without regard for any traffic rules."

The Japanese newspaper *Sankei Shimbun* praised, saying, "With the cooperation of the West in economics and culture, capitalist ideology has infiltrated in various ways. 'Voice of America,' 'British Broadcasting Corporation,' and other Western radio broadcasts can be easily listened to by turning on a transistor radio. Imported jazz music tapes are also on the market. Many foreigners living in Moscow, foreign cars lined up on the streets, and foreign goods flooding the markets have a great influence on the ideology of ordinary citizens, especially young people."

### 苏修全面复辟资本主义罪恶昭彰  日本资产阶级报纸拚命喝采叫好

　　苏修全面复辟资本主义罪恶昭彰
　　日本资产阶级报纸拚命喝采叫好
    据新华社讯　苏修领导集团在苏联国内全面彻底复辟资本主义的罪恶行径，受到帝国主义和各国反动派的夸奖。日本资产阶级报纸驻莫斯科的记者，最近就连续报道了今天苏联社会各个领域中的资本主义现象。从资产阶级报刊的喝采声中，人们也可以看出，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团已经把苏联糟踏成什么样子。这伙十月革命道路的叛徒，绝逃脱不了历史的严厉审判！
    日本《读卖新闻》最近在一篇报道中，赞扬勃列日涅夫、柯西金的“社会主义”同资本主义相比，只是“招牌不同，而内容相似”。
    报道称赞勃列日涅夫、柯西金实行资本主义“利润原则的范围在不断扩大”，“金钱第一”。
    报道说，“既然采用了利润方式，长期计划就越来越困难。同资本主义一样，要看每个时期的企业利润和国民消费的动向，来不断地调整经济。”
    日本《东京新闻》称赞苏联“特权阶级”“实行利润优先、自由化的新经济政策”。
    这家报纸说，苏联“国民中间的生活差距扩大了”。“在莫斯科，西红柿在夏季上市的时候，一公斤卖两个卢布。……基层工人要买一公斤西红柿，就必须付出一天的全部工资。然而在高级餐厅里，餐桌上堆满这样高价的西红柿，那些高薪的人们半天半天地享受着豪华的宴席。”
    据《读卖新闻》报道，“在莫斯科有一条大街叫‘海鸥街’。这不是确有一条叫‘海鸥街’的街道，而是由于苏联的高级官员爱用的最高级‘海鸥牌’汽车经常通过这条街而得名。漆黑的‘海鸥牌’汽车，后窗挂着新窗帘，不论一出现在什么地方，只要警察一吹警哨，所有的人和车子就得全部停驶，让路给这种汽车。在这样的情况下，这种汽车便不顾什么交通规则飞驰而去。”
    日本《产经新闻》赞扬说，“随着同西方的经济和文化的合作，资本主义的思想意识以各种方式钻进来了。‘美国之音’、‘英国广播公司’等西方的广播，只要打开半导体收音机，就可以轻松地听到。进口的爵士音乐录音带也上市了。住在莫斯科的许多外国人、街上排着的外国汽车、市场上泛滥的外国商品，对普通市民特别是对青年人的思想意识不知有多么大的影响”。
