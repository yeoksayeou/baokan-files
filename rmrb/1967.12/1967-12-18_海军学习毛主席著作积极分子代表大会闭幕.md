The vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

The First National Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works in the Navy has concluded. Over 4,000 representatives have decided to take Comrade Lin Biao as their shining example, to be absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They will elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They will resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's military thought and line of building the army. They will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate oneself and criticize and repudiate revisionism," and ignite a revolution in their souls.

The Navy Party Committee has made a decision to call on all units to learn from the shining deeds of Comrade Mei Xiande, Zhang Yimin, and the Party Committee of the 441st Unit. The conference has set up 22 model learners.

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: The first national conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the People's Liberation Army Navy has concluded successfully. Over the course of more than 20 days, over 4,000 representatives held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically sang the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, implemented and carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and summarized and exchanged the achievements and experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works over the past few years, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This conference is a great conference that specifically upholds the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Our reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, Chen Boda, and Yao Wenyuan, received all the representatives. This is the greatest care, trust, encouragement, and spur that Chairman Mao has given to the conference and all the officers and soldiers of the Navy.

Comrade Lin Biao's inscription for the conference, "The vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," has greatly inspired and educated the representatives and all the officers and soldiers, giving the Navy and the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country a new impetus to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and to further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

At the conference, the representatives unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the most outstanding leader of the proletariat of our time, and the greatest genius of our time. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the developed Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism. Specifically upholding the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the need of the proletarian revolution, the need to prevent and oppose modern revisionism, and the glorious mission entrusted by history. Specifically upholding the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought represents the highest requirement of our times and the highest interests of the people of the entire country and the world.

The representatives unanimously agreed that the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee stated: "Comrade Lin Biao called on the People's Liberation Army to launch a mass movement of studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong throughout the army, setting a shining example for the entire Party and the entire country." Comrade Lin Biao's active advocacy and vigorous promotion of the mass movement of popularizing Mao Zedong Thought have opened up a broad path for hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers to directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and created the fundamental way to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives believed that to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, one must take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, be absolutely loyal to the supreme commander Chairman Mao, loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Everyone pointed out that being loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao is the most fundamental stance, the most fundamental principle, the highest level of awareness, the greatest principle, the purest party spirit, and the greatest public spirit of a proletarian revolutionary. All revolutionary comrades of the proletariat must turn their deep affection for Chairman Mao into class consciousness and regard it as their sacred duty to act absolutely according to Mao Zedong Thought. The representatives expressed that they would resolutely do what Chairman Mao advocates, resolutely learn what Chairman Mao praises, resolutely change what Chairman Mao criticizes, and resolutely fight what Chairman Mao opposes. Whoever supports Chairman Mao, we will be close to them; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight them, and the entire Party and the entire country will condemn them.

The representatives believed that to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, one must take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, with the greatest determination and will, elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and truly grasp it. One must truly place studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. The understanding of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works must reach a new height, the practice must reach a new level, and the leadership must have a new attitude. In the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, one must produce good models, good cadres, and good experiences. The representatives pointed out that studying Chairman Mao's works must be combined with practice, with immediate results, and with a focus on application. Studying without applying, and words not matching deeds, is impure party spirit and disloyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Application means that for every instruction and strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, one must follow step by step, deeply understand, and carry out sentence by sentence and word by word. One must execute what is understood and also resolutely execute what is not yet understood, and deepen understanding in the process of execution. Truly turn Mao Zedong Thought into one's soul, command every nerve, and direct every action.

The representatives believed that to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, one must take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's military thought and line of building the army. The representatives believed that to uphold and defend Chairman Mao's military thought and line of building the army, one must grasp two fundamental points: First, in accordance with Chairman Mao's stipulations, the army must wholeheartedly serve the people and adhere to the strategic thought of people's war. One must resolutely carry out the three tasks stipulated by Chairman Mao: the People's Liberation Army is a fighting force, a work force, and a production force. Second, starting from the class nature of the proletarian revolutionary army, our army must be under the political leadership of the proletariat and must emphasize political construction. To this end, one must resolutely implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the four firsts, promote the three-eighths style, develop the three democracies, and carry out the movement of building excellent companies. One must resolutely and thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois military line. The representatives pointed out that the experience of fighting against Liu Shaoqi and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing tells us that class enemies often use the "red flag" to oppose the red flag and play revolutionary two-faced tricks.

We can only use Mao Zedong Thought, the strongest weapon, to timely expose and pierce through all the tricks of the class enemies in the struggle. The representatives said that in the struggle between the two lines, there is no room for compromise. We want Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely oppose revisionism. In the struggle, we must uphold the principle and firmness of the proletariat, not the vacillation and opportunism of the petty bourgeoisie, uphold the party spirit of the proletariat, not the factionalism of the petty bourgeoisie. We must fear neither heaven nor earth, nor death nor hardship, dare to trample the surging waves, and overcome all class enemies.

The representatives believed that specifically upholding the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate oneself and criticize and repudiate revisionism" and ignite a revolution in their souls. The representatives pointed out that at present, one must focus on solving four relationships: First, one must grasp both major and minor issues, with a focus on major issues. Grasping major issues means grasping the political direction, especially the attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Second, one must fight both a "protracted war" and a "quick decisive battle" and "annihilation battle," with a focus on fighting a good "quick decisive battle" and "annihilation battle." In a certain period, one must concentrate forces and take the initiative to attack, solving one or two problems according to the situation, tasks, and active thoughts of the troops. Third, one must look at both daily performance and performance in critical moments, with a focus on performance in critical moments. Performance in critical moments means that in the struggle between the two lines, one must be able to stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, especially in the face of a "twelfth-level typhoon," dare to go against the wind and waves, and be able to "not get lost" and "not get seasick," and be able to "die but not lose Mao Zedong Thought," and be able to serve the Party's interests unconditionally when personal interests conflict with the Party's interests; it means being able to sacrifice everything for the revolution in battle, dare to fight at close range and at night, and bravely fight the enemy without fear of sacrifice. Fourth, one must grasp both grassroots cadres and soldiers and middle and high-level cadres, with a focus on grasping good middle and high-level cadres. Middle and high-level cadres must maintain close contact with the masses, study together with the soldiers, and break private interests and establish public interests, not rely on past merits, and create new merits for the people.

At the conference, the representatives repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions word by word and sentence by sentence, discussed the great victories and unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and decided to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and better complete the glorious tasks of defending the country's maritime defense, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and "three supports and two militaries."

The conference passed a letter of respect to the great commander Chairman Mao, a letter of determination to Comrade Lin Biao, and a letter to all officers and soldiers of the Navy.

During the conference, the Navy Party Committee made a decision to call on all units to seriously study Comrade Mei Xiande, the good soldier of Chairman Mao, the political commissar of a certain unit who upheld Mao Zedong Thought's absolute authority and achieved many victories in naval battles, Zhang Yimin, and the Party Committee of the 441st Unit, which bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The conference set up 22 advanced units and individuals as model learners for the Navy. Among them are the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment," the "Sea Tigers Boat," the "Sea Pioneers Boat," a certain unit's beacon team, a certain unit's landing boat first detachment, the unit where Comrade An Yemin served, the Changjiang Ship, the third flight squadron of a certain naval academy, the class where Comrade Zhao Erchun served, the projection team of a certain warehouse, and Shu Jicheng, Miao Deyao, Wang Ruichang, Wang Shoujin, Liang Yezhi, Li Erchu, Liang Daocheng, Ou Qingwei, Hu Yunzheng, and others.

Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army Yang Chengwu attended the opening and closing ceremonies of the conference. Responsible comrades of the Navy, Xiao Jingguang, Li Zuopeng, Wang Hongkun, and Zhang Xiuquan, participated in the conference. Li Zuopeng gave a report titled "Take Comrade Lin Biao as a Shining Example, Forever Loyal to the Great Commander Chairman Mao, Forever Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line." Wang Hongkun gave an important speech. Zhang Xiuquan summarized the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the Navy. The representatives extensively exchanged experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Forty-three advanced collectives and individuals in studying Chairman Mao's works spoke at the conference. The representatives unanimously reflected that this conference is a lively class on Mao Zedong Thought. The conference was filled with a serious, tense, united, and lively atmosphere. During the conference, the representatives also participated in the struggle meeting against the revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing organized by the revolutionary rebels of the Navy's direct-affiliated organs, the "Red Alliance."

Responsible comrades of various general departments, various military branches, and the Beijing Military Region, such as Wu Faxian, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Qiu Huizuo, Zhang Chiming, Yu Lizhong, Luo Xunzhi, Zheng Weishan, Liu Jinping, Lu Yang, Chen Xianrui, Chen Shizhang, Fu Chongbi, Huang Zuozhen, Wu Lie, Chen Renqiu, Tan Furen, Huang Zhiyong, Jiang Wen, Li Zhen, Liu Fu, Luo Huasheng, Liu Zhong, and Song Weizhi, attended the opening and closing ceremonies of the conference.

    新华社十七日讯　中国人民解放军海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，最近胜利闭幕。在历时二十多天的大会上，四千多名代表高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，热情地歌颂了伟大领袖毛主席和光焰无际的毛泽东思想，贯彻和落实了毛主席的最新指示，总结交流了几年来特别是无产阶级文化大革命以来，活学活用毛主席著作的成绩和经验。这次大会，是大树特树毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的绝对权威的大会。
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，以及周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、江青、戚本禹、姚文元等同志，接见了全体代表。这是伟大领袖毛主席对大会和海军全体指战员最大的关怀，最大的信任，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。
    毛主席的亲密战友林副主席给大会的题词：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，极大地鼓舞和教育了大会代表和全体指战员，给了海军和全党、全军、全国大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想绝对权威，进一步开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动以新的推动力量。
    会上，代表们一致指出，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。伟大的毛泽东思想，是发展了的马克思列宁主义，是最高水平的马克思列宁主义。大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，这是无产阶级革命的需要，是防止和反对现代修正主义的需要，是历史赋予我们的光荣使命。大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，代表了我们时代的最高要求，代表了全中国和全世界人民的最高利益。
    代表们一致认为：党的八届十一中全会公报指出：“林彪同志号召人民解放军在全军展开学习毛泽东同志著作的群众运动，为全党全国树立了光辉的榜样。”林彪同志积极倡导、全力推进的毛泽东思想大普及运动，开创了亿万工农兵群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的广阔道路，创造了大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威的根本途径。
    代表们认为，要大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，就必须以林副主席为光辉榜样，无限地忠于最高统帅毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。大家指出：忠于伟大统帅毛主席，这是无产阶级革命战士最根本的立场，最根本的大节，最高的觉悟，最大的原则性，最纯的党性，最大的公。一切无产阶级革命派都要把无限热爱毛主席的深厚感情真正变为阶级的自觉，把绝对按照毛泽东思想办事作为自己的神圣职责。代表们表示，毛主席提倡的我们坚决干，毛主席表扬的我们坚决学，毛主席批评的我们坚决改，毛主席反对的我们坚决斗。谁拥护毛主席，我们就和他亲；谁反对毛主席，我们就和他拚，就全党共诛之，全国共讨之。
    代表们认为，要大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，就必须以林彪副主席为光辉榜样，以最大的决心和最大的毅力，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到更新的阶段，把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来。要真正把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置上。对活学活用毛主席著作，认识要有新高度，学用要有新水平，领导要有新姿态。在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中，要出好典型，要出好干部，要出好经验。代表们指出，学习毛主席著作，一定要学用结合，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫。学了不用，言行不一，就是党性不纯，就是对毛主席和毛泽东思想的不忠。用，就是对毛主席的每一个指示，每一个战略部署，都要步步紧跟，深刻领会，句句照办，字字照办，坚决照办；理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要坚决执行，并在执行的过程中加深理解。真正把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，统帅自己的每一根神经，指挥自己的每一个行动。
    代表们认为，要大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，就必须以林副主席为光辉榜样，坚决贯彻和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决贯彻和捍卫毛主席的军事思想和建军路线。到会代表认为，坚持和捍卫毛主席的军事思想和建军路线，应当着重把握两个基本点：第一，遵循毛主席规定的我军全心全意为人民服务的建军宗旨和人民战争的战略思想，必须坚决执行毛主席规定的三大任务，即人民解放军既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是生产队。第二，从无产阶级革命军队的阶级性质出发，我们军队必须服从于无产阶级的政治领导，要着重政治建军。为此，就要坚决贯彻林副主席的指示，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动。就要坚决彻底批判反动的资产阶级军事路线。代表们指出，和中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿作斗争的经验告诉我们，阶级敌人往往打着“红旗”反红旗、玩弄反革命的两面手法。
　　我们在斗争中只有运用毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器，才能及时识破和戳穿阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计。代表们说，在两条路线斗争中，没有调和的余地。我们要的是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，坚决反对修正主义。在斗争中，我们一定要坚持无产阶级的原则性和坚定性，不要小资产阶级的动摇性和投机性，要坚持无产阶级的党性，不要小资产阶级的派性。我们要天不怕，地不怕，死不怕，苦不怕，敢于踏平惊涛骇浪，压倒一切阶级敌人。
    代表们认为，大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，必须坚决响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，在灵魂深处爆发革命。代表们指出，当前必须着重解决好四个关系：第一，既要抓大节，又要抓小节，重点是抓大节。抓大节就是抓政治方向，特别是抓对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席革命路线的态度问题。第二，既要打“持久战”，又要打“速决战”和“歼灭战”，重点是打好“速决战”和“歼灭战”。在一定时期，要根据形势任务和部队活思想，集中力量主动进攻，解决好一两个问题。第三，既要看平时表现，又要看关键时刻过硬，重点是看关键时刻过硬，关键时刻过硬就是要看在两条路线斗争中，能不能坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，特别是在“十二级台风”打击下，敢不敢顶逆风，抗恶浪，能不能做到“不迷航”，“不晕船”，做到“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢”，就是要看在个人利益和党的利益发生尖锐矛盾的情况下，能不能自觉地无条件地服从党的利益，为革命献出自己的一切；就是要看在战斗中，敢不敢近战夜战，英勇杀敌，不怕牺牲。第四，既要抓基层干部战士，又要抓中高级干部，重点是抓好中高级干部。中高级干部要密切同群众的联系，同战士一起学习，一起破私立公，不要吃老本，要为人民立新功。
    会上，代表们反复地逐字逐句地学习了毛主席的最新指示，畅谈了无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利和空前大好形势，决心紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，更好地完成保卫祖国海防、保卫无产阶级文化大革命和“三支”“两军”等项光荣任务。
    大会通过了给伟大统帅毛主席的致敬信，通过了给林副主席的决心书。大会还通过了给海军全体指战员的信。
    会议期间，海军党委作出决定，号召所属部队认真学习毛主席的好战士、战斗英雄麦贤得，在海战中大树毛泽东思想绝对权威、屡建战功的某部政治委员张逸民和英勇捍卫毛主席革命路线的四四一一部队党委的光辉事迹。
    会上树立了二十二个先进单位和先进个人为海军学习毛主席著作的标兵。其中有“海空雄鹰团”、“海上猛虎艇”、“海上先锋艇”、某部航标队、某部登陆艇一分队、安业民生前所在连、长江舰、某航校飞行三中队、赵尔春生前所在班、某仓库放映组和舒积成、缪德尧、王瑞昌、王守金、梁叶枝、李而初、梁道成、欧庆伟、胡云正等。
    人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武参加了大会的开幕式和闭幕式。海军负责人萧劲光、李作鹏、王宏坤、张秀川等参加了大会。李作鹏在会上作了《以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线》为题的报告。王宏坤作了重要讲话。张秀川作了海军活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的总结。代表们广泛交流了活学活用毛主席著作的经验，四十三个学习毛主席著作的先进集体和个人在大会上发了言。代表们一致反映，这次大会是一个最生动的毛泽东思想学习班。会议充满着既严肃、紧张，又团结、活泼的气氛。会议期间，代表们还参加了海军直属机关无产阶级革命派“红联总”发起召开的斗争反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的大会。
