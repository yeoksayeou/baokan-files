The vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

The First National Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works in the Navy has concluded. Over 4,000 representatives have decided to take Comrade Lin Biao as their shining example, to be absolutely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They will elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They will resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's military thought and line of building the army. They will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate oneself and criticize and repudiate revisionism," and ignite a revolution in their souls.

The Navy Party Committee has made a decision to call on all units to learn from the shining deeds of Comrade Mei Xiande, Zhang Yimin, and the Party Committee of the 441st Unit. The conference has set up 22 model learners.

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: The first national conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the People's Liberation Army Navy has concluded successfully. Over the course of more than 20 days, over 4,000 representatives held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically sang the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, implemented and carried out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and summarized and exchanged the achievements and experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works over the past few years, especially during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This conference is a great conference that specifically upholds the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Our reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, Chen Boda, and Yao Wenyuan, received all the representatives. This is the greatest care, trust, encouragement, and spur that Chairman Mao has given to the conference and all the officers and soldiers of the Navy.

Comrade Lin Biao's inscription for the conference, "The vast ocean relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," has greatly inspired and educated the representatives and all the officers and soldiers, giving the Navy and the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country a new impetus to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and to further promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

At the conference, the representatives unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the most outstanding leader of the proletariat of our time, and the greatest genius of our time. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the developed Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism. Specifically upholding the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the need of the proletarian revolution, the need to prevent and oppose modern revisionism, and the glorious mission entrusted by history. Specifically upholding the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought represents the highest requirement of our times and the highest interests of the people of the entire country and the world.

The representatives unanimously agreed that the communiqu√© of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee stated: "Comrade Lin Biao called on the People's Liberation Army to launch a mass movement of studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong throughout the army, setting a shining example for the entire Party and the entire country." Comrade Lin Biao's active advocacy and vigorous promotion of the mass movement of popularizing Mao Zedong Thought have opened up a broad path for hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers to directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and created the fundamental way to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives believed that to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, one must take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, be absolutely loyal to the supreme commander Chairman Mao, loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Everyone pointed out that being loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao is the most fundamental stance, the most fundamental principle, the highest level of awareness, the greatest principle, the purest party spirit, and the greatest public spirit of a proletarian revolutionary. All revolutionary comrades of the proletariat must turn their deep affection for Chairman Mao into class consciousness and regard it as their sacred duty to act absolutely according to Mao Zedong Thought. The representatives expressed that they would resolutely do what Chairman Mao advocates, resolutely learn what Chairman Mao praises, resolutely change what Chairman Mao criticizes, and resolutely fight what Chairman Mao opposes. Whoever supports Chairman Mao, we will be close to them; whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight them, and the entire Party and the entire country will condemn them.

The representatives believed that to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, one must take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, with the greatest determination and will, elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and truly grasp it. One must truly place studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. The understanding of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works must reach a new height, the practice must reach a new level, and the leadership must have a new attitude. In the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, one must produce good models, good cadres, and good experiences. The representatives pointed out that studying Chairman Mao's works must be combined with practice, with immediate results, and with a focus on application. Studying without applying, and words not matching deeds, is impure party spirit and disloyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Application means that for every instruction and strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, one must follow step by step, deeply understand, and carry out sentence by sentence and word by word. One must execute what is understood and also resolutely execute what is not yet understood, and deepen understanding in the process of execution. Truly turn Mao Zedong Thought into one's soul, command every nerve, and direct every action.

The representatives believed that to specifically uphold the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, one must take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's military thought and line of building the army. The representatives believed that to uphold and defend Chairman Mao's military thought and line of building the army, one must grasp two fundamental points: First, in accordance with Chairman Mao's stipulations, the army must wholeheartedly serve the people and adhere to the strategic thought of people's war. One must resolutely carry out the three tasks stipulated by Chairman Mao: the People's Liberation Army is a fighting force, a work force, and a production force. Second, starting from the class nature of the proletarian revolutionary army, our army must be under the political leadership of the proletariat and must emphasize political construction. To this end, one must resolutely implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasize proletarian politics, adhere to the four firsts, promote the three-eighths style, develop the three democracies, and carry out the movement of building excellent companies. One must resolutely and thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois military line. The representatives pointed out that the experience of fighting against Liu Shaoqi and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing tells us that class enemies often use the "red flag" to oppose the red flag and play revolutionary two-faced tricks.

We can only use Mao Zedong Thought, the strongest weapon, to timely expose and pierce through all the tricks of the class enemies in the struggle. The representatives said that in the struggle between the two lines, there is no room for compromise. We want Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely oppose revisionism. In the struggle, we must uphold the principle and firmness of the proletariat, not the vacillation and opportunism of the petty bourgeoisie, uphold the party spirit of the proletariat, not the factionalism of the petty bourgeoisie. We must fear neither heaven nor earth, nor death nor hardship, dare to trample the surging waves, and overcome all class enemies.

The representatives believed that specifically upholding the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate oneself and criticize and repudiate revisionism" and ignite a revolution in their souls. The representatives pointed out that at present, one must focus on solving four relationships: First, one must grasp both major and minor issues, with a focus on major issues. Grasping major issues means grasping the political direction, especially the attitude towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Second, one must fight both a "protracted war" and a "quick decisive battle" and "annihilation battle," with a focus on fighting a good "quick decisive battle" and "annihilation battle." In a certain period, one must concentrate forces and take the initiative to attack, solving one or two problems according to the situation, tasks, and active thoughts of the troops. Third, one must look at both daily performance and performance in critical moments, with a focus on performance in critical moments. Performance in critical moments means that in the struggle between the two lines, one must be able to stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, especially in the face of a "twelfth-level typhoon," dare to go against the wind and waves, and be able to "not get lost" and "not get seasick," and be able to "die but not lose Mao Zedong Thought," and be able to serve the Party's interests unconditionally when personal interests conflict with the Party's interests; it means being able to sacrifice everything for the revolution in battle, dare to fight at close range and at night, and bravely fight the enemy without fear of sacrifice. Fourth, one must grasp both grassroots cadres and soldiers and middle and high-level cadres, with a focus on grasping good middle and high-level cadres. Middle and high-level cadres must maintain close contact with the masses, study together with the soldiers, and break private interests and establish public interests, not rely on past merits, and create new merits for the people.

At the conference, the representatives repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions word by word and sentence by sentence, discussed the great victories and unprecedented good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and decided to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and better complete the glorious tasks of defending the country's maritime defense, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and "three supports and two militaries."

The conference passed a letter of respect to the great commander Chairman Mao, a letter of determination to Comrade Lin Biao, and a letter to all officers and soldiers of the Navy.

During the conference, the Navy Party Committee made a decision to call on all units to seriously study Comrade Mei Xiande, the good soldier of Chairman Mao, the political commissar of a certain unit who upheld Mao Zedong Thought's absolute authority and achieved many victories in naval battles, Zhang Yimin, and the Party Committee of the 441st Unit, which bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The conference set up 22 advanced units and individuals as model learners for the Navy. Among them are the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment," the "Sea Tigers Boat," the "Sea Pioneers Boat," a certain unit's beacon team, a certain unit's landing boat first detachment, the unit where Comrade An Yemin served, the Changjiang Ship, the third flight squadron of a certain naval academy, the class where Comrade Zhao Erchun served, the projection team of a certain warehouse, and Shu Jicheng, Miao Deyao, Wang Ruichang, Wang Shoujin, Liang Yezhi, Li Erchu, Liang Daocheng, Ou Qingwei, Hu Yunzheng, and others.

Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army Yang Chengwu attended the opening and closing ceremonies of the conference. Responsible comrades of the Navy, Xiao Jingguang, Li Zuopeng, Wang Hongkun, and Zhang Xiuquan, participated in the conference. Li Zuopeng gave a report titled "Take Comrade Lin Biao as a Shining Example, Forever Loyal to the Great Commander Chairman Mao, Forever Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao's Proletarian Revolutionary Line." Wang Hongkun gave an important speech. Zhang Xiuquan summarized the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the Navy. The representatives extensively exchanged experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Forty-three advanced collectives and individuals in studying Chairman Mao's works spoke at the conference. The representatives unanimously reflected that this conference is a lively class on Mao Zedong Thought. The conference was filled with a serious, tense, united, and lively atmosphere. During the conference, the representatives also participated in the struggle meeting against the revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing organized by the revolutionary rebels of the Navy's direct-affiliated organs, the "Red Alliance."

Responsible comrades of various general departments, various military branches, and the Beijing Military Region, such as Wu Faxian, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Qiu Huizuo, Zhang Chiming, Yu Lizhong, Luo Xunzhi, Zheng Weishan, Liu Jinping, Lu Yang, Chen Xianrui, Chen Shizhang, Fu Chongbi, Huang Zuozhen, Wu Lie, Chen Renqiu, Tan Furen, Huang Zhiyong, Jiang Wen, Li Zhen, Liu Fu, Luo Huasheng, Liu Zhong, and Song Weizhi, attended the opening and closing ceremonies of the conference.
