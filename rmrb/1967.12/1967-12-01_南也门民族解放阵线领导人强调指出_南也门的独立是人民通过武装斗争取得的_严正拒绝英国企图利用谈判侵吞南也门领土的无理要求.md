Leader of the National Liberation Front of South Yemen Emphasizes that South Yemen's Independence Was Won Through Armed Struggle and Firmly Rejects Britain's Unreasonable Demands to Annex South Yemen's Territory Through Negotiations

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Aden, November 30th: On the 30th, the leader of the National Liberation Front of South Yemen, Qatan Shabi, emphasized at a press conference in Aden that South Yemen's independence was won by the South Yemen people through armed struggle.

	Shabi, who led the National Liberation Front delegation to Geneva in late November to discuss matters related to South Yemen's independence with the British side, returned to Aden on the morning of the 30th and was warmly welcomed by the people.

	Shabi said at the press conference held after arriving at Aden Airport, "Our struggle is for the complete independence and sovereignty of our homeland."

	He said, "The National Liberation Front delegation went to Geneva not to negotiate independence. The South Yemen people have won independence through their armed forces."

	He said: The British delegation tried to pressure our delegation. The British delegation wanted to carve out some of South Yemen's territory and also wanted to send a British military delegation to our armed forces. However, all of this was rejected by our delegation.

	He said: We told the British delegation that the South Yemen people have won independence and sovereignty with their own blood, so the British delegation has no room for bargaining. We also notified Britain to withdraw its troops from our territory and not to return.

	When mentioning the financial issues involved in the negotiations with Britain, Shabi said, the National Liberation Front delegation went to Geneva to demand that Britain compensate for the 129 years of exploitation of South Yemen. Regarding this issue, the National Liberation Front delegation will continue to negotiate with the British authorities.

    南也门民族解放阵线领导人强调指出
    南也门的独立是人民通过武装斗争取得的
    严正拒绝英国企图利用谈判侵吞南也门领土的无理要求
    据新华社亚丁三十日电　南也门民族解放阵线领导人卡坦·沙比三十日在亚丁举行的记者招待会上强调，南也门独立是南也门人民通过武装斗争取得的。
    沙比在十一月下旬率领民族解放阵线代表团去日内瓦就南也门独立的有关事项，同英国方面进行了谈判。民族解放阵线代表团在三十日上午回到亚丁，受到人民的热烈欢迎。
    沙比在到达亚丁机场以后举行的记者招待会上说，我们的斗争是为了争取我们祖国的完全独立和主权。
    他说，民族解放阵线代表团到日内瓦去，不是为了谈判独立，南也门人民是用人民武装力量取得独立的。
    他说：英国代表团企图给我们代表团施加压力。英国代表团要把南也门的一些领土划出去，并要向我们的武装部队派一个英国军事代表团。但是，所有这些都被我们代表团拒绝了。
    他说：我们对英国代表团说，南也门人民是用自己的鲜血取得独立和主权的，因此，英国代表团没有什么可以讨价还价的余地。我们还通知英国把军队撤出我国国土，不要回来。
    沙比在提到同英国谈判中涉及的财经问题时说，民族解放阵线代表团去日内瓦是要求英国赔偿过去一百二十九年英国对南也门的剥削。关于这一问题，民族解放阵线代表团将继续同英国当局谈判。
