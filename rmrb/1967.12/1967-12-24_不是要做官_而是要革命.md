	Not to Seek Official Positions, but to Make Revolution
	Former Commander of the "Sea Pioneer Boat," First-Class Hero of Merit  Shí Tiāndìng

	The Chinese Khrushchev has always used the decaying bourgeois worldview to poison Party members. According to his words, Communist Party members work to "ultimately make a name for themselves," to become the "representatives" and "leaders" of the masses. He wants people to vie for fame and fortune, to climb higher and higher, to become officials and lords.

	The great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Communist Party members, no matter when or where, should not place personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people. Therefore, selfishness, laziness, corruption, and the desire for fame are the most despicable; while the spirit of selflessness, diligence, public service, and hard work is what is worthy of respect."

	We proletarian revolutionary fighters engage in revolution and work, never for the sake of "making a name for ourselves." "To face difficulties head-on and let others take the credit" is our revolutionary style. The black talk of the Chinese Khrushchev is the greatest insult to us. A true proletarian revolutionary fighter must take the "Three Articles" as their guiding principles, cultivating the spirit of selflessness, diligence, public service, and hard work.

	The wind of fame that the Chinese Khrushchev advocates is diametrically opposed to the revolutionary heroism advocated by the great leader Chairman Mao. This is a fundamental contradiction between the bourgeois and proletarian class standpoints and two worldviews. Revolutionary heroism is based on the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the fundamental interests of all humanity. To face difficulties head-on, to strive to be pioneers, and to set examples is to make greater contributions to the people. Only revolutionary heroism based on the principle of "public interest" can be invincible and unstoppable. With such revolutionary heroism, on the battlefield of gunfire, in the face of hardships, and amidst the raging waves, we dare to step forward, take risks, shoulder heavy burdens, be pioneers for the people, and achieve new merits. In the face of honor and achievements, we do not become arrogant or complacent, but strive to forever be servants of the people. The great leader Chairman Mao has praised our boat's participation in the Wanshan Sea Battle and the "August 6" Sea Battle. The Party and the people have also bestowed upon us the glorious title of "Sea Pioneer Boat." This is our greatest glory, our greatest happiness, and also the greatest care and encouragement from the Party and the people.

	The bourgeois wind of fame is a poison that corrupts the souls of Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters, and it is the black goods of revisionists who seek peaceful evolution. Those who seek fame put themselves forward as heroes who create history, fundamentally do not believe in or rely on the masses, and at the slightest opportunity, they claim credit for the work of others, record their personal achievements, and stick gold on their faces. Such people do not work hard but instead boast about their minor achievements, running around all day chasing fame and fortune, hoping to make a name for themselves with a small trick.

	We must take "Fight Selfishness, Criticize Revisionism" as our guideline, thoroughly criticize and expose the "wind of fame" and the mentality of seeking official positions that the Chinese Khrushchev uses to corrupt us, and carry out a revolution in our souls, forever advancing along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

    不是要做官  而是要革命
    原“海上先锋艇”艇长、一等战功荣立者  石天定
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯用腐朽的资产阶级世界观来毒害党员。照他的说法，共产党员干工作，是为了“最后出风头”，为了当群众的“代表”、“领袖”。他要人们去争名逐利，一直往上爬，做官当老爷。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。因此，自私自利，消极怠工，贪污腐化，风头主义等等，是最可鄙的；而大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干的精神，才是可尊敬的。”
    我们无产阶级革命战士干革命，做工作，从来不是为了“出风头”。“见困难就上，见荣誉就让”，才是我们的革命风格。中国赫鲁晓夫的黑话，是对我们最大的侮辱。一个真正的无产阶级革命战士，必须以“老三篇”为座右铭，培养“大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干”的共产主义精神。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的风头主义，同伟大领袖毛主席所倡导的革命英雄主义，是针锋相对的，这是资产阶级和无产阶级两个阶级立场、两种世界观的根本对立的反映。革命英雄主义是从无产阶级根本利益出发的，是从全人类根本利益出发的。见了困难就上，争当先锋，做模范，是为了对人民做出更大的贡献。只有建立在“公”字基础上的革命英雄主义，才能所向无敌，无坚不摧。有了这样的革命英雄主义，在炮火纷飞的战场上，在艰苦困难面前，在惊涛骇浪中，我们敢于挺身而出，冒危险，挑重担，为人民当闯将，立新功。我们在荣誉和成绩面前，不骄傲，不自满，立志永远当人民的勤务员。伟大领袖毛主席对我们艇参加万山海战和“八·六”海战，都给予表扬，党和人民还授予我们“海上先锋艇”的光荣称号。这是我们最大的光荣、最大的幸福，也是对我们最大的关怀、最大的鞭策。
    资产阶级的风头主义是腐蚀共产党员、革命战士灵魂的毒药，是修正主义者搞和平演变的黑货。风头主义者，把自己当成创造历史的英雄，根本不相信和依靠群众，一遇机会，就贪天之功为己功，在个人功劳簿上记账，往自己脸上贴金。这种人，不是老老实实埋头苦干，而是凭一星半点资本吹牛，整天东奔西跑追逐名利，妄想搞个小动作，一举成名。
    我们一定以“斗私，批修”为纲，把中国赫鲁晓夫用来腐蚀我们的“风头主义”和做官思想批倒批臭，在灵魂深处闹革命，永远沿着毛主席指引的航向前进。
