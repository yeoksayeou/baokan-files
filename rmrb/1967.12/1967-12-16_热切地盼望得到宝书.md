A Vietnamese worker named Azao sent two letters, written in both Chinese and Vietnamese, to Chinese comrades. The content of the letters was the same: "Comrades: We are extremely grateful for Chairman Mao and the Chinese people's sincere and selfless aid to us. I would like to request some of Chairman Mao's works to study. Wish you good health and progress in your work!

Long live the People's Republic of China!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

Comrade Azao's request was soon fulfilled. Gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait in the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," he excitedly said, "Now it's good, my long-held wish has been fulfilled!" As he spoke, he couldn't help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" This Vietnamese worker also enthusiastically told the Chinese comrades, "I will definitely study Chairman Mao's books diligently, just like Lei Feng, and follow Chairman Mao's words."

　　热切地盼望得到宝书
    一位叫阿造的越南工人，寄了用中、越两种文字写的两封同样内容的信给中国同志。信上这样写着：“同志们：我们非常感谢毛主席和中国人民对我们的真诚的无私的援助。我想向你们要一些毛主席著作学习。祝你们身体健康，工作进步！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    阿造同志的要求不久便得到了满足。他凝视着《毛主席语录》里的毛主席像激动地说：“这下子好了，我长期的愿望实现了！”说着说着便情不自禁地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”这位越南工人还兴奋地对中国同志说：“我一定要象雷锋那样努力地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话。”
