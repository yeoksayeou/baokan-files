On November 18, the pound sterling was devalued for the third time, causing a major disturbance in the monetary system of the capitalist world. Twenty countries and regions also devalued their currencies, and there were rushes to buy gold and silver in London, Paris, and Zurich. The devaluation of the pound sterling and the ensuing chaos not only reflect the decline of British imperialism but also indicate the deepening of the financial and monetary crisis in the capitalist world, the intensification of imperialist contradictions, and the further development of the crisis in the capitalist system.

Since the end of the Second World War, as British imperialism has increasingly declined, the pound sterling has repeatedly faced crises. Following the pound sterling crisis in October 1964, the Labour government's measures to improve the balance of payments, stabilize the pound, cut domestic consumption, reduce imports, freeze wages, and stimulate exports have largely failed. Over the past three years, Britain's balance of payments has not only failed to achieve equilibrium but has resulted in a deficit of 1.237 billion pounds. Domestic industrial production has been largely stagnant. This year, the number of unemployed reached a record high of 700,000. To avoid bankruptcy, the Labour government has had to beg for huge loans from abroad each year. Before the devaluation of the pound sterling, Britain's outstanding foreign debt was $3 billion.

The reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the British ruling class have further deepened Britain's economic difficulties. This year, its support for Israel's aggression against Arab countries resulted in the closure of the Suez Canal, causing Britain to lose 120 million pounds in trade and freight. The anti-British struggle by patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong caused the Hong Kong economy to lose over 100 million pounds. The strike by dock workers in London and Liverpool in September caused Britain to lose tens of millions of pounds in exports. Additionally, in October, Britain's foreign trade deficit reached 107 million pounds, further worsening Britain's balance of payments and leading to an expected deficit of over 400 million pounds. In a situation where both domestic and foreign confidence in the pound sterling has been lost, a new pound sterling crisis finally erupted in early November.

To deal with the pound sterling crisis, the Wilson government, as usual, sought "international support," but this time it was not smooth. Despite the Wilson government's urgent appeal to Washington, the Johnson government was also in trouble. The heavy burden of the Vietnam War expenses caused the U.S. budget for the current fiscal year to face a deficit of over $20 billion, and the balance of payments deficit would also exceed $2.5 billion. The Wilson government had no choice but to turn to Western European countries for loans. Thus, around the pound sterling crisis, a sharp and complex struggle over financial hegemony among imperialist countries unfolded.

In mid-November, Britain held secret talks with finance ministers from the U.S., France, West Germany, Italy, and other countries in Paris. Britain, hoping to maintain the pound sterling's value and avoid stringent conditions in borrowing, proposed a demand for a $3 billion unconditional loan. The U.S., fearing that the devaluation of the pound sterling would undermine the credibility of the dollar, also strongly urged Western European countries to be generous. However, France and West Germany, appearing as creditors, were unwilling to contribute more money and demanded various guarantees from Britain, including economic supervision. Additionally, they pressured Britain to devalue the pound sterling. This created a serious confrontation. In a situation where the pound sterling was in crisis and loans were not forthcoming, Britain threatened that if it could not borrow a large sum of money, the pound sterling would be devalued by 30%. If Britain really did this, it would greatly disrupt the financial and trade systems of the capitalist world, triggering a global economic crisis, which would be a serious threat to other capitalist countries. Therefore, after repeated haggling, a compromise agreement was finally reached: the U.S. and Western European countries, through the International Monetary Fund, would provide Britain with a $1.4 billion loan. Britain, in turn, had to guarantee the "reorganization" of its economy, reduce domestic consumption, and devalue the pound sterling by 14.3%. Britain's dream of maintaining the pound sterling's position was thus shattered.

The Western European countries, led by France, were naturally unwilling to help Britain stabilize the pound sterling's position. The U.S. and Britain's control of the capitalist world's finance, using the dollar and pound sterling as "international reserve currencies," to expand their influence in Western Europe, has long caused strong resentment among Western European countries. In recent years, the economic strength of countries like France and West Germany has relatively increased, while the credibility of the dollar and pound sterling has repeatedly been shaken, making them even more eager to overthrow the U.S. and Britain's dominance of the Western world's financial and monetary system. Since the devaluation of the pound sterling has seriously shaken this system, France and other Western European countries can only be pleased. In this round of Western European gold-buying frenzy, France not only refused to continue the so-called "gold pool" with the U.S. to stabilize world gold prices but also used its dollars to buy gold, adding pressure on the dollar. Obviously, as imperialist contradictions intensify, Western European countries' efforts to undermine the dollar and pound sterling will only become stronger.

For Britain, the most direct purpose of devaluing the pound sterling is to enhance the export competitiveness of British industrial products, which have become cheaper due to the devaluation, thereby improving the country's balance of payments. However, more than half of Britain's raw materials and food are imported, and their prices will inevitably rise after the devaluation of the pound sterling, leading to an increase in the cost of domestic industrial products and significantly reducing the effect of the devaluation. Additionally, the devaluation of the pound sterling this time is far from enough to reverse Britain's dire trade situation, which is evident to all. Moreover, the devaluation of the pound sterling will accelerate the disintegration of the pound sterling area, further shrinking Britain's traditional export markets. Therefore, the devaluation of the pound sterling will not truly help Britain get out of its predicament.

After the Labour government announced the devaluation of the pound sterling, the income of British workers and the broad middle and small bourgeoisie was severely hit, and their living standards further declined. The British people have already taken to the streets in protest, strongly demanding the resignation of the Labour government and immediate general elections. The devaluation of the pound sterling has greatly intensified class contradictions within Britain, and the days of British imperialism will be even harder.

Following the devaluation of the pound sterling, many capitalist countries have taken measures such as currency devaluation, tax increases, and wage freezes to protect their domestic monopolistic capital and ruling classes' interests. This will inevitably deepen the suffering of the people in these countries, further intensifying the contradictions between the people of various countries and imperialism and reactionary forces, and promoting the awakening of the people of various countries.

The devaluation of the pound sterling occurred in a situation where the U.S., West Germany, France, and Britain have all experienced varying degrees of economic "recession" over the past year, and the capitalist world market has severely contracted. Therefore, after the devaluation of the pound sterling, the competition among various countries to seize overseas markets will inevitably become more intense. Currently, the U.S., France, West Germany, and other countries have already taken measures to strengthen tariff protection and increase exports. The U.S. has already imposed strict import quotas on a series of British export goods. The six countries of the "Common Market" held an emergency meeting the day after the devaluation of the pound sterling to deal with British export competition. France has demanded that Britain abolish the 3% subsidy given to its exporters as a prerequisite for France's participation in the new $1.4 billion loan to Britain.

The devaluation of the pound sterling will also greatly intensify the currency struggle among imperialist countries for world financial hegemony. In addition to the French franc and the West German mark, which will further compete with the unstable U.S. and British currencies, the competition between the dollar and the pound sterling will also become increasingly fierce. After the devaluation of the pound sterling, the British Labour government raised the interest rate of the Bank of England to 8%, one of whose purposes was to attract a large amount of U.S. short-term funds to Britain, which is obviously not beneficial to the U.S. In fact, with the recent large-scale outflow of U.S. gold, the possibility of the devaluation of the dollar is increasing.

The devaluation of the pound sterling has greatly intensified the internal contradictions of British imperialism and has also greatly promoted the contradictions among imperialist countries. As our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The imperialist system is riddled with contradictions that cannot be overcome, plunging the imperialists into great anguish." The days of imperialism are numbered.

### 英镑贬值说明了什么？

    英镑贬值说明了什么？
    十一月十八日，英镑第三次贬值，引起了资本主义世界货币体系的大混乱。二十个国家和地区的货币也随着贬值，并且在伦敦、巴黎和苏黎世发生抢购黄金和白银的风潮。英镑贬值和随之发生的混乱，不仅反映了英帝国主义的衰落，而且反映了当前资本主义世界金融货币危机的深化，帝国主义矛盾的加剧，资本主义制度的危机进一步发展。
    第二次世界大战以后，随着英帝国主义的日益没落，英镑不断发生危机。在一九六四年十月的那次英镑危机之后，工党政府为改善国际收支、稳定英镑所采取的向国内劳动人民开刀，压缩国内消费，减少进口，冻结工资，刺激出口等措施，大都宣告失败。三年来英国国际收支不但没有取得平衡，而且造成赤字共达十二亿三千七百万镑之巨。国内工业生产基本上处于停滞状态。今年失业人数达到七十万的惊人纪录。为了免于破产，工党政府每年都要向国外乞讨巨额贷款。英镑贬值前英国积欠未还的外债就有三十亿美元。
    英国统治集团反动的内外政策进一步加深了英国的经济困难。今年它支持以色列侵略阿拉伯国家，结果导致了苏伊士运河的封锁，使英国在贸易和运费上损失了一亿二千万镑。我香港爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争，使港英经济损失一亿多镑。伦敦和利物浦码头工人九月份罢工，使英国出口损失数千万镑。加上十月份英国对外贸易有一亿零七百万镑的巨大逆差，这就使英国今年的国际收支更形恶化，又将要出现四亿镑以上的巨额赤字。在国内外都对英镑失去信任的情况下，新的英镑危机终于在十一月上旬爆发了。
    为了应付英镑的危机，威尔逊政府照例寻求“国际支持”，但是这一次却并不顺利。尽管威尔逊政府向华盛顿告急，约翰逊政府却自顾不暇。侵越军费的沉重负担使美国本财政年度的预算将出现二百多亿美元的惊人赤字，国际收支逆差也将达到二十五亿美元以上。威尔逊政府只好被迫向西欧国家借贷。于是围绕着英镑危机，就展开了一场帝国主义国家之间争夺金融霸权的尔虞我诈的尖锐复杂斗争。
    十一月中，英国同美、法、西德、意大利等国财长在巴黎举行了十国秘密谈判。英国为了想要保持英镑不贬值，并在借款时不附带苛刻条件，在会上提出了无条件借款三十亿美元的要求。美国害怕英镑贬值后会动摇美元信用，也竭力要求西欧国家慷慨解囊。但是，以债权人身份出场的法国和西德等国既不愿多出钱，又要英国作出各种保证，接受经济上的监督。此外，它们还力迫英国实行英镑贬值。这就形成严重对立。在英镑吃紧、借款又不能到手的情况下，英国扬言，如果借不到巨额贷款，英镑就要贬值百分之三十。如果英国真的这样做，就将大大打乱资本主义世界的金融和贸易，触发世界性经济危机，这对其他资本主义国家来说，是一种严重的威胁。因此经过反复的讨价还价，最后终于达成一项折衷协议：由美国和西欧国家一道，通过国际货币基金组织，给予英国十四亿美元贷款。英国方面则必须保证“整顿”本国经济，压缩国内消费，并将英镑贬值百分之十四点三。英国想保住英镑地位的美梦，就这样破灭了。
    以法国为代表的西欧大陆国家自然不乐意帮助英国稳定英镑的地位。美国和英国把持资本主义世界金融，利用美元、英镑的“国际储备货币”地位，在西欧扩张势力，一直引起西欧国家的强烈不满。几年来，法国、西德等国的经济实力已相对增长，而美元、英镑信用却不断发生动摇，这就使得它们更加急于推翻美英把持西方世界金融货币体系的局面。英镑贬值既然严重动摇了这一体系，法国等西欧国家只会感到高兴。在这次西欧抢购黄金的热潮中，法国不但断然拒绝了继续同美国搞所谓“黄金总库”，来稳定世界黄金价格，而且还拿出手中的美元去抢购黄金，加重对美元的压力。显然，随着帝国主义矛盾的加剧，西欧国家竭力要搞垮美元和英镑的斗争，只会越来越加强。
    对英国来说，英镑贬值的最直接目的，是加强因英镑贬值而降价的英国工业品的出口竞争能力，以此来改进本国国际收支状况。但英国一半以上的原料和食品都要依靠进口，英镑贬值后，它们的价格必然要上升，这就会造成国内工业品成本的上涨，使英镑贬值的作用大大缩小。另外，这次英镑贬值的幅度远不足以扭转英国的恶劣贸易处境，这也是人所共见的。况且英镑贬值将使英镑区加速分裂，使英国的传统出口市场进一步缩小。因此，英镑贬值并不能使英国真正摆脱它的困境。
    在工党政府宣布英镑贬值后，英国工人和广大中小资产阶级的收入受到沉重的打击，生活水平进一步下降。英国人民已纷纷举行示威，表示抗议，强烈要求工党政府下台，立即举行大选。英镑贬值大大加剧了英国国内的阶级矛盾，英帝国主义的日子将更加难过。
    随着英镑贬值，许多资本主义国家采取了货币贬值、增税、冻结工资等等措施，来保护本国的垄断资本和统治集团的利益，这势必加深这些国家人民的痛苦，从而加剧各国人民同帝国主义和各国反动派之间的矛盾，促使各国人民进一步觉醒起来。
    英镑贬值是在一年来美国、西德、法国、英国都不同程度地出现经济“衰退”，资本主义世界市场严重萎缩的情况下发生的。因此，英镑贬值后，必然使各国争夺海外市场的斗争更趋剧烈。目前美国、法国、西德等已经在采取措施，加强关税保护，增加出口。美国已经在一系列英国出口商品上采取了严格的进口限额制。“共同市场”六国在英镑贬值的第二天就开了应付英国出口竞争的紧急会议。法国已要英国废除给本国出口商百分之三的津贴，作为法国参加给英国十四亿美元新贷款的先决条件。
    英镑贬值也将大大加剧帝国主义国家之间争夺世界金融霸权的货币斗争。除了法国的法郎和西德的马克，将进一步同不稳定的美英货币展开竞争以外，美元和英镑之间的竞争也同样将日趋激烈。英镑贬值后，英国工党政府把英格兰银行利率提高到百分之八，其目的之一是要把美国的大量短期资金吸引到英国来，这对美国当然是不利的。实际上，随着最近美国黄金的大量流失，美元贬值的可能性正在增长。
    英镑贬值大大加剧了英帝国主义的国内矛盾，也大大促进了帝国主义各国之间的矛盾。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出的：“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”帝国主义的寿命是不会很长了。
