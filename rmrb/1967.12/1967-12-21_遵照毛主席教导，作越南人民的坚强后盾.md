We resolutely support you. Our two countries are neighboring countries that depend on each other like lips and teeth. Our two peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. The Vietnamese people in the South and all the Vietnamese people can believe that your struggle is our struggle. Seven hundred million Chinese people are the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. In the face of the unbreakable fighting unity of our two peoples, any military adventure and political deception by American imperialism is doomed to failure.

	Mao Zedong

	Standing Firmly Behind the Vietnamese People as Taught by Chairman Mao

	The Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Masses' Great Alliance Committee

	On the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the great leader of the world revolutionary people and the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, sent a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho. This telegram is not only the greatest support and encouragement for the Vietnamese people in the South, but also the greatest support and encouragement for the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao's telegram fully expresses the wishes of 700 million Chinese people and the wishes of the revolutionary people of the world. We, the revolutionary masses and all revolutionary workers of the Knitting Factory, have carefully studied this telegram and conducted extensive discussions and exchanges. Everyone fully supports and endorses Chairman Mao's telegram! We all expressed our determination to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and regard supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation as our unshirkable internationalist duty.

	The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, in the fiery years of battle, has raised the great banner of resisting American aggression and saving the nation, uniting the broadest masses of people from all walks of life in South Vietnam around itself, and waged a relentless struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys. It has fully demonstrated the power of people's war and set a brilliant example of armed revolutionary struggle against American imperialism for all the people of the world.

	The great victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation has conclusively proven: relying on the people, persisting in armed struggle, and using revolutionary war to resist counter-revolutionary war is the only path for oppressed nations and peoples to achieve thorough liberation.

	As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Your victory once again shows that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." The heroic people of South Vietnam, with the fearless spirit of "only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards," dare to struggle and dare to win. They have fought the so-called "powerful" American imperialism and its lackeys to the point of being in a desperate and miserable situation, forcing them into the vast sea of people's war and facing annihilation. "The days of the American aggressors in Vietnam are numbered." "Victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people!"

	The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is trying to bring the Vietnamese issue onto the track of Soviet-American cooperation, using the counter-revolutionary two-faced tactic of fake support and real betrayal, actively helping American imperialism to carry out the sinister plots of "bombing to force peace" and "stopping bombing to lure peace," attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation. We warn the Soviet revisionists that this is absolutely impossible! In the face of the heroic Vietnamese people and the unbreakable fighting unity of our two peoples, any military adventure and political deception by American imperialism is doomed to failure.

	The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has made the Chinese people more powerful in supporting the just struggle of our Vietnamese brothers. Seven hundred million Chinese people will forever be the steadfast rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China will forever be the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will always unswervingly support the heroic Vietnamese people. We, the revolutionary masses and all revolutionary workers of the Knitting Factory, resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, step by step following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, "to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," to "support the army and love the people," to seize the revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness, do a better job in all aspects, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, with practical actions firmly supporting the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against American aggression for national salvation. When the Vietnamese people need us, as soon as the great commander Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately march to the front line of the struggle against American imperialism and fight shoulder to shoulder with our Vietnamese brothers, driving the American aggressors out of the sacred land of Vietnam, not leaving a single one behind!

    我们坚决支持你们。我们两国是唇齿相依的邻邦。我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。兄弟的越南南方人民和全体越南人民可以相信，你们的斗争就是我们的斗争。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。在我们两国人民坚强的战斗团结面前，美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗都是注定要失败的。				毛泽东
    遵照毛主席教导，作越南人民的坚强后盾
    北京针织总厂无产阶级革命派大联合委员会
    在越南南方人民的光荣旗手——越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年之际，世界革命人民的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电，不仅是对越南南方人民的最大支持和鼓舞，而且是对世界革命人民的最大支持和鼓舞。毛主席的贺电，完全说出了七亿中国人民的心愿，说出了世界革命人民的心愿。我们针织总厂的无产阶级革命派和全体革命职工，认真地学习了这个贺电，并进行了广泛的座谈和讨论。大家对毛主席的贺电一千个支持，一万个拥护！纷纷表示坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，当做自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。
    越南南方民族解放阵线在炮火纷飞的战斗岁月里，高举抗美救国的伟大旗帜，把越南南方各阶层人民最广泛地团结在自己的周围，同美帝及其走狗进行了艰苦卓绝的战斗，极大地发挥了人民战争的威力，为全世界人民树立了反美武装革命斗争的光辉榜样。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，雄辩地证明：依靠人民，坚持武装斗争，用革命战争反对反革命战争，是被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取彻底解放的唯一道路。
    正如伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”英雄的越南南方人民，以“独有英雄驱虎豹”的大无畏精神，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，把号称“强大”的美帝国主义及其走狗打得焦头烂额，走投无路，狼狈不堪，使之陷入了人民战争的汪洋大海之中，面临灭顶的命运。“美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。”“胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民！”
    苏联修正主义领导集团竭力想把越南问题纳入苏美合作的轨道，使用假支持、真出卖的反革命两面手法，积极帮助美帝国主义大搞“以炸迫和”和“停炸诱和”的阴谋，妄图扑灭越南人民抗美救国战争的革命烈火。我们正告苏修，这是绝对办不到的！在英雄的越南人民面前，在我们两国人民坚强的战斗团结面前，美帝国主义的任何军事冒险和政治欺骗，都是注定要失败的。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，使中国人民更有力量支援越南兄弟的正义斗争。七亿中国人民永远是越南人民的坚强后盾，中国的辽阔国土永远是越南人民的可靠后方。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，将始终不渝地支持英雄的越南人民。我们针织总厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，“要斗私，批修”，要“拥军爱民”，要抓革命，促生产、促工作、促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，以实际行动坚决支持英雄的越南人民的抗美救国正义斗争。在越南人民需要的时候，只要伟大统帅毛主席一声令下，我们立即开赴反美斗争前线，与越南兄弟并肩战斗，把美国侵略强盗一个不剩地从越南神圣的土地上赶出去！
