Our Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe recently visited Japan at the invitation of the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox). They received enthusiastic assistance from Japanese friends and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Japanese people. They have made contributions to promoting cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between the peoples of China and Japan, and to strengthening the friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

However, the visit and performances of our Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe in various parts of Japan have been repeatedly obstructed and sabotaged by Japanese reactionaries and their followers. The Sato government, on the one hand, incited and connived at the distribution of reactionary leaflets by Japanese Communist Party revisionists, threatening the audience and disrupting the theater, using this as an excuse to pick a fight. On the other hand, it deployed reactionary police to provide extensive protection. The Japanese police authorities even went so far as to illegally abduct a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese General Association who assisted in the troupe's performances on trumped-up charges. This is another serious anti-China political incident deliberately created by the Japanese reactionaries. The Chinese people are greatly indignant at such despicable behavior by the Sato government.

The Sato government has consistently followed the policy of the U.S. imperialists in hostility towards the Chinese people. After conspiring with Johnson during his visit to the United States, Sato's anti-China arrogance has become even more brazen. He frequently issues anti-China rants and continuously provokes the Chinese people; recently, he even shamelessly "invited" the head of the Kuomintang bandit, Chiang Ching-kuo, to Japan to jointly plot new anti-China conspiracies. During this period, the Sato government has also intensified political persecution of pro-China organizations and patriotic overseas Chinese, openly searching the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), which advocates for friendship between Japan and China, and the Japan Foreign Trade Promotion Association and the Kansai branch of the Japan Foreign Trade Promotion Association, which are dedicated to developing trade between Japan and China. These facts show that the Sato government is actively promoting fascism and militarism, escalating its service to the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism, and wholeheartedly acting as the spearhead of U.S. imperialism's anti-China efforts in Asia.

In this anti-China atrocity perpetrated by the Sato government, the Miyamoto revisionist clique played a very shameful role as a thug. This incident is actually a farce performed by the Sato reactionary government and the Miyamoto revisionist clique. When the Japanese revisionists wreak havoc, the reactionary police cheer from the sidelines; when the Japanese revisionists' destructive activities are opposed by revolutionary masses, the reactionary police openly protect them; when the Japanese revisionists make unreasonable "complaints," the reactionary police illegally arrest people. The Japanese revisionists and the Japanese reactionaries work together so closely! This once again exposes the traitorous nature of the Miyamoto clique, proving that they are accomplices of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, traitors to the Japanese revolutionary people, and enemies of the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The Japanese people are good friends of the Chinese people." In Japan, the broad masses of the people all want to be friends with the Chinese people; only a small handful are anti-China. The deep friendship forged between the peoples of China and Japan in their common struggle is unbreakable by any force. Whether it is the Sato government, the Miyamoto clique, or both colluding together, all their anti-China conspiracies are doomed to fail. The more they rave against China, the faster they hasten their own doom.

    佐藤政府的又一反华罪行
    本报评论员
    我国东方红杂技团最近应日中友好协会（正统）总部的邀请，到日本进行访问演出，得到日本朋友的热情帮助，受到广大日本人民的热烈欢迎。他们为促进中日两国人民的文化交流和相互了解，加强中日两国人民的友谊，作出了贡献。
    但是，我国东方红杂技团在日本各地的访问演出活动，一再遭到日本反动派及其追随者的阻挠和破坏。佐藤政府一面唆使和纵容日共修正主义分子散发反动传单，威胁观众，扰乱剧场，借端寻衅，一面出动反动警察多方加以庇护。日本警察当局最后甚至以莫须有的罪名，非法绑架协助杂技团演出的东京华侨总会工作人员。这是日本反动派蓄意制造的又一严重的反华政治事件。中国人民对于佐藤政府的这种卑鄙行径表示极大的愤慨。
    日本佐藤政府一贯追随美帝国主义敌视中国人民的政策。佐藤在访问美国同约翰逊密谋之后，反华气焰更加嚣张。他频繁地发出反华叫嚣，不断地向中国人民挑衅；最近更悍然把蒋匪帮头目蒋经国“邀请”到日本，共同策划新的反华阴谋。就在这个期间，佐藤政府还加紧了对日中友好团体和爱国华侨的政治迫害，公然搜查坚持日中友好的日中友好协会（正统）总部、致力于发展日中贸易的日本国际贸易促进协会和日本国际贸易促进协会关西总部等团体。种种事实表明，佐藤政府积极推行法西斯化和军国主义化，变本加厉为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策效劳，死心塌地充当美帝国主义在亚洲的反华的急先锋。
    在佐藤政府这次制造的反华暴行中，宫本修正主义集团扮演了极可耻的打手的角色。这次事件实际上是佐藤反动政府和宫本修正主义集团合演的一出双簧丑剧。日修分子猖狂捣乱，反动警察就从旁助威；日修分子的破坏活动遭到革命群众的反对，反动警察就公然加以保护；日修分子无理“告状”，反动警察就非法捉人。日修分子和日本反动派一搭一档，配合得多么紧密！这就再一次暴露出了宫本集团的叛徒面目，证明他们是美日反动派的帮凶，是日本革命人民的叛徒，是中日友好事业的敌人。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“日本人民同中国人民是好朋友。”在日本，广大人民都是要同中国人民友好的，反华的只是一小撮。中日两国人民在共同斗争中结成的深厚的战斗友谊，是任何力量也破坏不了的。不管是佐藤政府也好，宫本集团也好，两家勾结一起也好，他们的一切反华阴谋，都是注定要失败的。他们越是疯狂反华，越是加速他们自己的灭亡。
