Long live! Long, long live!" They said, "The ocean is deep, but not as deep as Chairman Mao's grace; the universe is vast, but not as vast as Chairman Mao's merits." All the representatives wrote in their letter of respect to our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, "We will take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, and will definitely build the two million strong army of the working class in Shanghai into a force that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is brave and good at fighting, full of vigor, and strong, to contribute all our strength to thoroughly completing the historical task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The revolutionary workers of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory excitedly said, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, ten thousand words cannot express our boundless respect for you, ten thousand songs cannot sing your great achievements. We, the working class, will forever be loyal to you, forever loyal to your great thought. We will definitely, in the struggle of the Cultural Revolution, better study and apply your brilliant works, forever follow you—the great helmsman—to carry out the revolution." The revolutionary masses and garrison troops of 150,000 people in Qingdao held a celebration rally on the 4th. The responsible comrade of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Yang Baohua, said at the meeting, "All our actions are under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, step by step following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carrying out Chairman Mao's every directive to the letter, and doing our work better."

The Revolutionary Committee of Heilongjiang Province immediately convened a standing committee meeting to discuss the news and notified all levels of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the province via telephone to make "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, carrying out the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" by Vice Chairman Lin and the editorial of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily on the 4th as compulsory courses for the study classes.

We resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and forever follow Chairman Mao to carry out the revolution."

The revolutionary workers of the factory expressed their determination to print more works of Chairman Mao in the future, to let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought be planted all over China and the world. In the busy autumn season in the suburbs of Guangzhou, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, after hearing this great joyous news, were inspired and encouraged, saying, "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, carrying out the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. The more we study the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' the clearer our minds become, the more we sing 'Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman,' the higher our spirits become.

The representatives attending the experience exchange meeting of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the Civil Aviation Management Bureau of Chengdu immediately prepared short and concise artistic performances to propagate this great joyous event to the revolutionary masses. They said, "We will study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, propagate Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime, and spread Mao Zedong Thought widely and deeply to the broad masses of the people."

The broad revolutionary masses in Hubei, Zhejiang, Jilin, Hebei, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, and other places held discussions, saying, "To be forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao is to be loyal to the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and to be loyal to the great cause of communism. The most important manifestation of being loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao is to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's directives. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn and apply, work hard on the application, resolutely be proletarian revolutionaries who are consistent in words and deeds, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

New China News Agency, December 4th: The joyous news that our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received revolutionary soldiers from the Navy and Communication Corps spread like spring breeze, quickly reaching all over the country, and causing great rejoicing in the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces. The broad officers and soldiers, amid cries of joy, seriously studied the editorial "Study Mao Zedong Thought: Learn and Apply, See Immediate Results" published in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, and unanimously expressed their determination to respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, to better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle of the Cultural Revolution, to closely follow, deeply understand, and link to reality every word and directive from Chairman Mao, and to carry them out to the letter, to forever be strong soldiers who are infinitely loving, believing, admiring, and loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Today, from dawn to late at night, the various units of the Navy were immersed in an atmosphere of boundless happiness and joy. "Wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" and "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" cries of joy echoed through the ports, airports, barracks, and coastal artillery positions. The broad officers and soldiers of the 227 ship, which Chairman Mao had inspected 14 years ago, heard the news and immediately gathered in the cabin where Chairman Mao had stayed, gazing at the photo of Chairman Mao and the officers and soldiers of the ship, and reading aloud Chairman Mao's brilliant inscription: "To oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must definitely build a strong navy." They excitedly said: "Dear Chairman Mao, over the past 14 years, your great image has always inspired us, and your brilliant thought has always guided us forward. We deeply understand that navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and to build a strong people's navy, we must rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." A responsible comrade of a certain naval fleet was extremely excited and said: The great leader Chairman Mao receiving the representatives of the Navy Active Study of Chairman Mao's Works Representatives Conference is the most brilliant page in the history of our people's navy. We must take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, take "criticizing and repudiating the self and criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, and promote the thought revolution of all personnel in the fleet. The news reached the certain "Four Good" communication station of the South China Sea Fleet, which has been guarding the high mountain outpost for 14 years as one. The officers and soldiers repeatedly studied Vice Chairman Lin's inscription "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, carrying out the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" and the editorial of today's People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, and resolved to take "criticizing and repudiating the self and criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, to cause a revolution in the depths of the soul, to build an iron wall against revisionism in one's mind, and to forge the South China front into a strong fortress for defending the motherland and supporting the world revolution.

The news reached the various units of the Communication Corps scattered across the country, and the dispersed detachments and outposts immediately held celebration rallies and parades at night, joyously acclaiming Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's great care and encouragement for the Communication Corps. The certain machinery station guarding the national border received the news and immediately, despite the heavy snow, convened a mobilization meeting at night, determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao's latest directives, to learn and apply, to see immediate results, and to carry out the directives in a resolute and swift manner. The soldiers of a certain outpost, who have been maintaining the line in the mountains for many years and have been evaluated as the "Four Good" maintenance outpost for six consecutive years, were extremely excited after hearing the news, solemnly pledged while holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: "Although we are thousands of miles away from Beijing, our hearts are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao." The officers and soldiers of the Communication Corps units stationed in Jiangxi and other places immediately dispatched Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams after hearing the news, beating drums and gongs, to go to the organs, schools, factories, and villages to report the joy to the broad revolutionary masses. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Communication Corps held a discussion until dawn after finishing the celebration meeting early in the morning. Everyone excitedly expressed their determination to forever remember Vice Chairman Lin's directive: "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, carrying out the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," to launch a greater wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and to make the Communication Corps into a big school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

Today, the officers and soldiers of the garrison troops in various places across the country have launched enthusiastic celebration activities. In the capital, the proletarian revolutionaries of the various general departments, various military branches, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, the National Defense Industrial Office, and the Beijing Garrison leadership organs of the People's Liberation Army universally held celebration meetings or discussion meetings. Some units also sent representatives to the leadership organs of the Navy and Communication Corps to congratulate them. The proletarian revolutionaries of the direct subordinate organs of the Air Force held a celebration and discussion that night after hearing the news, and the officers and soldiers repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" The responsible comrades of the Beijing Garrison, Zheng Weishan, Wu Shien, Xiao Wenju, and Huang Zhen, held a celebration meeting with the broad officers and soldiers in the morning, and in the afternoon, they seriously studied Vice Chairman Lin's inscription at the party committee's plenary meeting. All the attendees unanimously expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to do a better job of the "three supports, two military affairs" tasks, to be models of criticizing and repudiating the self and criticizing and repudiating revisionism, to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The officers and soldiers of the unit where the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Nian Siyang, are stationed, after hearing this great joyous news and the editorial published in the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily while on duty on the train, immediately formed several propaganda teams to go to various carriages to report the joy and propagate to the passengers, and to sit and discuss with the passengers. They resolutely expressed: We will definitely study Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, not relax for a moment; execute Chairman Mao's directives for a lifetime, not deviate by a hair; propagate Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime, not stop for a moment; defend Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime, not change our minds even if the sky falls and the earth cracks.

In Shanghai, the entire day was filled with drumming and cheering at the garrison sites of various units. More than ten thousand three-army officers and soldiers and representatives of the broad proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai held a grand celebration meeting. The responsible comrades of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the local garrison, Liao Zhenguo, Li Shiyue, Rao Shoukun, Duan Dezhang, Zhou Jianping, and Wang Weiguo, attended the meeting. After the meeting, a grand celebration parade was held.

In the Guangzhou, Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuhan, Jinan, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Kunming units, and the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions, the officers and soldiers also held various celebration activities today. Some units visiting and touring the revolutionary cradle Jinggangshan together with the proletarian revolutionary representatives of the Jinggangshan area held a meeting in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. Everyone swore: We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, study Chairman Mao's works more actively, use them better, forever inherit the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Red Army, follow the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, and in the struggle of criticizing and repudiating the self and criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and on the battlefield of the "three supports, two military affairs," create new merits for the people. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Qingdao garrison, who have made outstanding achievements in the "left support" work, immediately launched a high tide of great study, great discussion, and great propaganda after hearing the news. They said, "We will definitely concentrate our greatest efforts on studying Chairman Mao's works, use our greatest efforts to execute Chairman Mao's directives, use our greatest enthusiasm to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, use our greatest courage to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and use our greatest efforts to criticize and repudiate the self and criticize and repudiate revisionism, and turn the whole world into a new world of Mao Zedong Thought." The officers and soldiers of the "Four Good" company of a certain unit of the Shenyang Garrison, in deep discussion, expressed their determination to take "criticizing and repudiating the self and criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, to seriously sum up the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and reforming the worldview in the total evaluation of this year, and to turn the company into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Railway Corps, while working in the cold and forested areas, armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, overcame many unimaginable difficulties, and built the railway to the depths of the forest. They excitedly said after hearing the news, "We will definitely better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fight with the self for a lifetime, fight with revisionism for a lifetime, fight with heaven for a lifetime, fight with the earth for a lifetime, and fight out a red Mao Zedong Thought new world." The officers and soldiers of the third company of a certain unit of the Tibet Border Defense Forces, when the Indian aggressor army launched an armed attack on us on October 1st this year, relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly smash the armed provocation of the Indian reactionaries. They said, "Vice Chairman Lin's inscription 'Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, carrying out the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought' is the absolute truth. With the great Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we fear nothing. We will definitely turn the border into an iron wall that cannot be broken."

On December 3rd, the representatives of the first Navy Active Study of Chairman Mao's Works Representatives Conference, who were received by our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, held a grand meeting overnight, joyously celebrating this great joyous event with boundless excitement and infinite happiness.

    在广州、沈阳、南京、武汉、济南、福州、兰州、成都、昆明部队和新疆、西藏军区，指战员们今天也都举行了各种庆祝活动。正在革命摇篮井冈山参观访问的一些部队的学习毛主席著作积极分子、英雄模范和先进集体代表，同井冈山地区的无产阶级革命派一起集会。大家在毛主席像前宣誓：一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高举更高举，把毛主席著作学得更活，用得更好，永远继承红军的光荣革命传统，按照毛主席开辟的革命航道，在斗私批修的战斗中，在“三支”“两军”的战场上，为人民立新功。在支左工作中做出显著成绩的青岛驻军某部指战员，听到喜讯，立即掀起了大学习大讨论大宣传的高潮。他们说，一定要把最大的精力集中在学习毛主席著作上，把最大的干劲用在执行毛主席指示上，把最大的热情用在宣传毛泽东思想上，把最大的勇敢用在捍卫毛主席的革命路线上，把最大的功夫用在斗私批修上，让整个世界变成毛泽东思想的新天地。沈阳部队某部四好连队炮二连在深入讨论中表示，决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，切实搞好今年的四好总评，在总评中认真总结活学活用毛主席著作，改造世界观的经验，把连队办成毛泽东思想的大学校。铁道兵某部指战员在高寒林区施工，用毛泽东思想武装自己，克服了许多难以想象的困难，把铁路修到了林海腹地。他们听到喜讯后激动地说，我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，一辈子与私斗，与修斗，与天斗，与地斗，斗出个红彤彤的毛泽东思想新世界。西藏边防部队某部三连，在今年十月一日印度侵略军向我发动武装进攻时，依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，彻底粉碎了印度反动派的武装挑衅。他们说，林副主席的题词“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，这是千真万确的真理。有了伟大的毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们什么也不怕。我们一定能把边防筑成一道牢不可破的钢铁长城。（附图片）
