At a time when the entire nation is actively responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism," our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao personally approved the conferring of the honorable title of "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" upon the Sixth Platoon of the Fourth Company of the 6011 Unit of the People's Liberation Army. They also conferred the honorable title of "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" upon Platoon Leader Li Wenzhong. This sets a brilliant example for the entire army, the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, and the broad masses of revolutionaries in breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit, transforming their world outlook, and achieving ideological revolutionization. This is the greatest concern, encouragement, inspiration, and exhortation from the great leader Chairman Mao to all the officers and soldiers of the entire army, the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, and the broad masses of revolutionaries.

The heroic Sixth Platoon is red-hearted and loyal to Chairman Mao, following him closely without deviation. They resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions on "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," "protect the leftists," and "love the army and the people." They firmly believe in and meticulously follow every strategic deployment and battle command from Chairman Mao. From one battlefield to another in the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they support the left, support industry, support agriculture, and conduct military training. Wherever Chairman Mao points, they go, spreading Mao Zedong Thought and planting the seeds of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The masses praise them: "Wherever they pass, they leave a red trail; wherever they stay, they leave a red mark." They truly practice their iron-clad oath:

"Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao;
Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao;
Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow his instructions;
Chairman Mao waves his hand, I march forward."

The heroic Sixth Platoon pours their deep love for Chairman Mao into the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, regarding the protection of the leftists as defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the critical moment of the fierce struggle between the two lines, they stand firmly, fear no attacks, dare to take risks, and resolutely fight alongside the revolutionary leftists. In the critical moment of escorting Red Guards and revolutionary masses across the Gan River, the heroic soldiers of the Sixth Platoon bravely fought against the raging waters, rescuing one revolutionary comrade after another, writing a magnificent chapter of supporting the left and loving the people. The last words of the heroic platoon leader Li Wenzhong were: "Don't mind me, save the Red Guards!" Heroic soldier Li Congquan pushed the plank to the Red Guards in danger and sacrificed his life. Heroic soldier Chen Dianqiu, despite being ill, rushed into the raging waters and also sacrificed his life to save the revolutionary comrades. In their last moments, they still thought of Chairman Mao and the Red Guards of Chairman Mao.

The heroic Sixth Platoon is truly the good soldiers of the great leader Chairman Mao, the heroic collective that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and consciously achieves ideological revolutionization under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the shining example of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by our Communist Party are revolutionary forces. Our forces are completely for the liberation of the people and work thoroughly for the people's interests." The heroic Sixth Platoon is a typical representative of the great image of the People's Liberation Army that serves the people wholeheartedly. Their model deeds once again show that the People's Liberation Army, personally created and led by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the great wall that can be completely relied upon.

The emergence of Li Wenzhong and the heroic Sixth Platoon, along with heroes like Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, Cai Yongxiang, Nian Siwang, the Good Eighth Company, the Red Ninth Company, and the five companies of the 1124 Construction Site, is the result of Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in the hearts of the broad officers and soldiers of our army. It is the result of Vice Chairman Lin's leadership of the Military Commission's work, opening up the brilliant road of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, insisting on the Four Firsts, advocating breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit, and achieving ideological revolutionization. Li Wenzhong and the heroic Sixth Platoon have consciously raised the breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit to the height of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, to the height of unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao and the firm defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have achieved the revolutionary spirit of fighting for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line while alive and dying for it. Their revolutionary spirit has reached a new level. This is a new leap in our army's ideological revolutionization during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "We need to cultivate people who are public-spirited. Being public-spirited has different class characteristics. The public spirit we advocate is the public spirit of the people, the proletariat, socialism, and communism."

From the standpoint of the proletariat, what is the highest standard of "public spirit"? It is unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, unlimited loyalty to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time, fully embodying the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broadest laboring masses of China and the world. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the only correct line guiding the Chinese revolution and world revolution from victory to victory. Historical truth tells us: without Chairman Mao's wise leadership, without the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, and without the correct guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we would not have such a great party, great army, great country, and everything of the proletariat and laboring masses. Therefore, unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao is the greatest public spirit of the proletariat. Every revolutionary fighter must use this highest standard to demand of themselves. They must be like the heroic Sixth Platoon, breaking with selfishness, "breaking at the crucial point," establishing public spirit, "establishing at the root," and truly being red-hearted and loyal to Chairman Mao, following Chairman Mao closely without deviation.

Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: politics is the commander, the soul. "Without the correct political standpoint, it is like having no soul." The attitude towards Chairman Mao, towards Mao Zedong Thought, and towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the greatest politics. Breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit must emphasize politics and firmly grasp this major principle, thoroughly criticizing and repudiating various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois selfish thoughts that hinder our understanding and execution of the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions.

Under the guidance of the great banner of "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry out self-criticism," and under the illumination of the "Three Articles," we must take the heroic Sixth Platoon as our example, consciously break with selfishness and establish public spirit, uproot the roots of the bourgeois "self" in our minds, and build a great wall of proletarian "public spirit." Only in this way can we better carry out and execute Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely and unconditionally execute every battle command from Chairman Mao. For all of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must act immediately and see results instantly. We must firmly adhere to the course charted by Chairman Mao and strive for a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    无限忠于毛主席是最大的公
    正当全国人民积极响应毛主席关于要斗私，批修的伟大号召的时候，我们伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副统帅亲自批准，授予人民解放军6011部队某部六连四排以“支左爱民模范排”的光荣称号，授予排长李文忠同志以“支左爱民模范”的光荣称号，为全国军民破私立公，改造世界观，实现思想革命化，指出了光辉的榜样。这是伟大领袖毛主席对全军指战员、全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的激励，最大的鞭策。
    英雄的四排，赤胆红心忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席寸步不离。他们坚决执行毛主席关于“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”、“要保护左派”和“拥军爱民”的伟大指示。毛主席的每一个战略部署，每一个战斗号令，他们都坚信不疑，认真领会，步步紧跟，句句照办。在无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程中，支左、支工、支农、军训，从一个战斗阵地到另一个战斗阵地，毛主席指到那里，他们就走向那里，就把毛泽东思想传播到那里，把毛主席的革命路线扎根到那里。群众赞扬他们：“走过那里红一线，住到那里红一片。”他们真正实践了自己的钢铁誓言：
    “毛主席热爱我热爱，
    毛主席支持我支持，
    毛主席指示我照办，
    毛主席挥手我前进。”
    英雄的四排，把热爱毛主席的无比深厚的感情，倾注在无产阶级革命派身上，把保护左派看成是捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们在两条路线激烈搏斗的紧要关头，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，不怕围攻，敢担风险，坚决同革命左派战斗在一起。在护送红卫兵和革命群众横渡赣江遇险的万分紧急时刻，英雄四排的战士们，舍死忘生，奋战激流，出没在滔滔江水之中，抢救出一个又一个革命小将，写下了支左爱民的壮丽诗篇。英雄排长李文忠的最后一句话是：“不要管我，救红卫兵要紧！”英雄战士李从全最后把手中的木板推给遇险的红卫兵，自己壮烈牺牲。英雄战士陈佃奎带病冲进激流，也为抢救革命小将而献身。他们在生命的最后一刻，想到的还是毛主席，毛主席的红卫兵。
    英雄的四排，不愧是伟大统帅毛主席的好战士，不愧是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以最高的自觉在无产阶级专政下继续革命的英雄集体，不愧是无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的无产阶级大公的光辉榜样。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”英雄的四排，就是全心全意为人民服务的人民解放军的伟大形象的典型代表。他们的模范事迹，再一次表明，我们伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造和亲自领导、林彪副统帅直接指挥的举世无双的人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是完全可以信赖、完全可以依靠的伟大长城。
    李文忠和英雄四排的出现，同雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊、蔡永祥、年四旺、好八连、红九连、1124工地五个连队等英雄人物和英雄集体一样，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想在我军广大指战员心中深深扎根的结果，是林副主席主持军委工作以来，开创活学活用毛主席著作的光辉道路，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，号召破私立公，实现人的思想革命化的结果。李文忠和英雄四排，把破私立公自觉地提到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度，提到无限忠于毛主席，坚决保卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的高度，做到生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。他们的革命精神达到了新的境界。这是我军在无产阶级文化大革命中，把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段，在思想革命化方面出现的新的飞跃。
    林彪同志说：“我们就是需要培养为公的人。为公也有不同的阶级性。我们所说的公，是人民的公，无产阶级的公，社会主义、共产主义的公。”
    站在无产阶级立场上看，“公”字的最高标准是什么？就是无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    伟大领袖毛主席，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，集中地体现了全中国和全世界无产阶级和最广大劳动人民的根本利益。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是指引中国革命和世界革命从胜利走向胜利的唯一正确的路线。历史的真理告诉我们：没有毛主席的英明领导，没有毛泽东思想的光辉照耀，没有毛主席无产阶级革命路线的正确指引，就没有我们这样伟大的党、伟大的军队、伟大的国家，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的一切。因此，无限忠于毛主席，是无产阶级最大的公。每一个革命战士，都要以这个最高标准来要求自己。都要象英雄的四排那样，破私，“破在要害处”，立公，“立到根本上”，真正做到对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离。
    毛主席一再教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”对毛主席的态度，对毛泽东思想的态度，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度，是最大最大的政治。破私立公，必须突出政治，必须紧紧抓住这个大节，大破特破妨碍我们理解和执行伟大领袖毛主席指示的各种资产阶级、小资产阶级的私心杂念。
    我们要在“斗私，批修”伟大纲领的指引下，在“老三篇”的光辉照耀下，以英雄四排为榜样，自觉地破私立公，在头脑里挖掉资产阶级“私”字的根基，筑起无产阶级“公”字的长城。只有这样，才能更好地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，坚决地、不折不扣地执行毛主席的每一项战斗命令。对于毛主席的一切最新指示，我们都必须闻风而动，立竿见影。我们一定要坚定不移地按照毛主席所指引的航向，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面彻底的胜利。　（十二月八日）
