South Yemen's people, after a long struggle, have finally ended the 129-year colonial rule of British imperialism over South Yemen, achieved national independence, and proclaimed the birth of the People's Republic of South Yemen. The Chinese people extend warm congratulations to the people of South Yemen.

The people of South Yemen have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggle. For over a hundred years, the people of South Yemen have never stopped fighting against British imperialism and striving for national independence. Since 1963, the people of South Yemen have taken up arms and bravely launched an armed struggle against British imperialism. The workers of South Yemen have also carried out mass anti-British struggles, dealing heavy blows to British imperialism and finally forcing British imperialism to acknowledge South Yemen's independence. This is a great victory for the South Yemen national liberation movement, especially for the armed struggle of the South Yemen people over the past four years.

British imperialism has always regarded South Yemen, which has an important strategic position, as a military base for its aggression against Asia and Africa and for suppressing the Arab national liberation movement. It has also carried out brutal colonial exploitation of the South Yemen people. To maintain this colonial stronghold, British imperialism has conducted bloody military suppression and political deception against the South Yemen people. However, all these attempts have failed. The victory of the South Yemen people in their struggle for national independence is a major support and encouragement for the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa, especially the Arab countries.

However, imperialism will never accept its defeat easily. British imperialism is accustomed to using the tactic of retreat to advance in the Asia-Africa region, using neocolonialist methods to maintain its colonial interests. American neocolonialism is also trying to expand its influence to replace the position of old colonialism. They will undoubtedly use various treacherous means to sabotage South Yemen's national independence. Therefore, the task of the South Yemen people's anti-imperialist struggle is still arduous. We believe that the people of South Yemen will, after independence, unite as one and continue to persist in the struggle against the old and new colonialism led by U.S. imperialism, and achieve new victories in this struggle.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victories, and they give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles."

The Chinese people have consistently and resolutely supported the just struggle of the South Yemen people against British imperialism and for national independence. After South Yemen's independence, the deep friendship forged between the Chinese people and the South Yemen people in the anti-imperialist struggle will be further developed. The South Yemen people's just struggles against imperialism and for the defense of national independence will receive the full support of 700 million Chinese people. The Chinese people will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of South Yemen and the Arab countries in the common struggle against imperialism led by the United States, supporting and encouraging each other, and advancing together!

### 热烈祝贺南也门独立

    热烈祝贺南也门独立
    南也门人民经过长期的斗争，终于结束了英帝国主义对南也门的一百二十九年的殖民统治，取得了民族独立，宣告了南也门人民共和国的诞生。中国人民向南也门人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    南也门人民具有反帝反殖的光荣斗争传统。一百多年来，南也门人民从来没有停止过反对英帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争。从一九六三年以来，南也门人民拿起武器，英勇地展开了反对英帝国主义的武装斗争，南也门的工人也进行了群众性的反英斗争，给英帝国主义以沉重的打击，并且最后迫使英帝国主义不得不承认南也门的独立。这是南也门民族解放运动，特别是四年来南也门人民武装斗争所取得的伟大胜利。
    英帝国主义一向把具有重要战略地位的南也门，作为它侵略亚洲、非洲和镇压阿拉伯民族解放运动的军事基地，并且对南也门人民进行残酷的殖民剥削。为了保持这块殖民阵地，英帝国主义曾经对南也门人民进行血腥的军事镇压和政治欺骗。但是，这一切都没有能够得逞。南也门人民争取民族独立斗争的胜利，是对亚非人民特别是阿拉伯各国人民反帝斗争的重大支持和鼓舞。
    但是，帝国主义是决不会甘心于自己的失败的。英帝国主义惯于在亚非地区采取以退为进的策略，用新殖民主义的手法来维护它的殖民利益。美国新殖民主义也力图扩张自己的势力，以取代老殖民主义的地位。它们必然还要千方百计地采取种种阴险手法，来破坏南也门的民族独立。因此，南也门人民反帝斗争的任务还是很艰巨的。我们相信，南也门人民一定会在独立以后，团结一致，继续坚持反对以美帝为首的新老殖民主义的斗争，并在这一斗争中不断取得新的胜利。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”
    中国人民一贯地坚决支持南也门人民反对英帝国主义、争取民族独立的正义斗争。南也门人民取得独立之后，中国人民和南也门人民在反帝斗争中所结成的深厚友谊，必将得到进一步的发展。南也门人民反对帝国主义、维护民族独立的一切正义斗争，将得到七亿中国人民的全力支持。中国人民将同南也门人民和阿拉伯各国人民，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义的共同斗争中，互相支持，互相鼓舞，并肩前进！
