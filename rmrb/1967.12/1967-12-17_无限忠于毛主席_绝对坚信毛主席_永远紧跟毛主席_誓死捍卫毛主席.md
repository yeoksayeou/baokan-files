	Endlessly Loyal to Chairman Mao, Absolutely Believe in Chairman Mao,
	Forever Follow Chairman Mao, and Defend Chairman Mao with Our Lives

	Minutes of the Discussion on Learning the Heroic Deeds of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong's Unit Party Committee

	Recently, comrades attending the expanded meeting of the Party Committee of the unit where the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Comrade Li Wenzhong are located, with hearts full of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, studied the order from the Central Military Commission on conferring the honorable titles on the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong. They listened to the introduction of the heroic deeds of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, and unanimously expressed their determination to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," to take the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong as examples, to ignite a revolution in their souls, to thoroughly transform their worldviews, and to become proletarian revolutionary warriors who firmly believe in Chairman Mao without the slightest wavering, follow Chairman Mao without the slightest hesitation, and defend Chairman Mao with unwavering loyalty.

	Firmly Believe in Chairman Mao, Without the Slightest Wavering

	During the discussion, everyone was deeply moved by the Heroic Fourth Platoon's four ironclad oaths: "Where Chairman Mao loves, I love; where Chairman Mao supports, I support; where Chairman Mao instructs, I act; where Chairman Mao waves, I advance." They unanimously agreed that these four sentences are the concentrated embodiment of the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong's noble qualities of being endlessly loyal to Chairman Mao. In essence, it is about firmly establishing the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao in their souls. Everyone said that learning from the heroes' thoughts and following the heroes' path, the most important thing is to be like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, to absolutely believe in Chairman Mao, to diligently study Chairman Mao's works, to focus on applying them, to firmly follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and to thoroughly transform their worldviews.

	Wang Lisheng (Political Commissar of a certain unit): Our hearts' reddest sun, Chairman Mao, is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the most outstanding leader of the proletariat, and the greatest genius. The people of the world place their hopes for revolutionary victory on our great leader Chairman Mao. Our belief in Chairman Mao is the highest expression of proletarian feelings for the revolutionary people of the world and the greatest loyalty to the cause of communism. We must be like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, with the deepest class feelings, endlessly love Chairman Mao, and forever believe in Chairman Mao. It was like this in the past, it is like this now, and it will be like this in the future, for a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand years, forever!

	Zhao Feng (Unit Commander): The comrades of the Heroic Fourth Platoon share a common belief: firmly believing in Chairman Mao's leadership being absolutely correct, firmly believing in the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly believing that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, will definitely be victorious. This is the fundamental source of power for them to create earth-shattering heroic deeds in the great era of human history's transformation, and it is the fundamental guarantee for them to become Chairman Mao's good soldiers. Learning from the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, we must be like them, the more complex and intense the class struggle, the more we must follow Mao Zedong Thought, and listen to the commands of the great leader Chairman Mao. No matter what happens, we must firmly believe in the great leader Chairman Mao and the determination of the proletarian headquarters, without the slightest wavering.

	To absolutely believe in Chairman Mao, we must actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, ignite a revolution in our souls, and establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in our minds. If a cadre has too much "self," they will overestimate themselves, be self-righteous, and act cleverly, leading to wrong decisions and actions that harm the revolutionary cause. To be a qualified leader with high standards and awareness, one must thoroughly eliminate "self" and establish "public," truly having only Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in one's heart, with a single-minded devotion to revolution with Chairman Mao, and a single will to follow Chairman Mao to the end.

	Follow Chairman Mao, Without the Slightest Hesitation

	During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that to absolutely believe in and be loyal to Chairman Mao, one must be like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, with unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, following him without a moment's hesitation. They said that the Party Committee's leadership has countless tasks and ever-changing situations, but the most important thing is to follow Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and the proletarian headquarters represented by Chairman Mao. We must act swiftly and decisively, without the slightest hesitation.

	Zhao Changxiu (Deputy Political Commissar of a certain unit): In this great era where Mao Zedong Thought is the great banner, we must study Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions with all our might, honestly and earnestly, linking them with our thoughts, and learning from the masses' struggles. Only by taking an honest attitude and focusing on application can we deeply understand Chairman Mao's instructions, turning every word and every letter into our souls, guiding our thoughts, and directing our actions. This way, our hearts will be closer to Chairman Mao, our steps will follow Chairman Mao more closely, and our work will be done better. For a leader, striving to study Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions and closely following the great leader Chairman Mao is the most important task of a lifetime. We must be like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, treating the study of Chairman Mao's works, especially the active study and application of the "Three Articles," as the first need of our lives. At any time and in any situation, we must place it above everything, greater than everything, before everything, and more important than everything. We must consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldviews, forging our hearts into everlasting red hearts loyal to Chairman Mao, becoming good soldiers who follow Chairman Mao step by step.

	Sun Haozhen (Deputy Political Commissar of a certain unit): Endlessly loyal to Chairman Mao and forever following Chairman Mao means to faithfully execute Chairman Mao's instructions, earnestly carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions, doing as Chairman Mao says, and striking where Chairman Mao points. The great leader Chairman Mao is our highest commander, highest authority, and highest leader. For every instruction from Chairman Mao, we must treat it as the highest battle command, a guiding light, a direction for advancement, a weapon for battle, and a source of victory. We must follow step by step, without the slightest hesitation; carry out every sentence, without the slightest deviation; implement every word, with a hundred percent guarantee. Loyalty is shown through action. For Chairman Mao's instructions, we must understand and execute them resolutely, and even if we temporarily do not understand, we must execute them resolutely. Truly, for every great strategic deployment and battle order from the great leader Chairman Mao, we must believe without doubt, be firm and unwavering, execute resolutely, and complete the glorious tasks of "three supports, two militaries" assigned by the times.

	Dai Jintian (Deputy Unit Commander): To closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, we must prioritize spreading Chairman Mao's voice in all our work. Chairman Mao's words are the highest in standard and the greatest in power, every sentence is truth, and one sentence is worth ten thousand. The greatest responsibility of a leader is to spread Chairman Mao's voice as quickly as possible and to enthusiastically promote Mao Zedong Thought. No matter when or where, no matter the situation, we must promptly and swiftly, originally and completely, implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions into the troops and the masses, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to unify the will and actions of the troops' officers and soldiers. This way, our troops will be like the heroic Fourth Platoon, forever following the great leader Chairman Mao, overcoming any great difficulties, completing any arduous tasks, withstanding any strong winds and waves, and defeating any powerful enemies.

	Defend Chairman Mao, With Unwavering Loyalty

	During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that firmly establishing the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and defending Chairman Mao's highest leadership position is the fundamental interest of the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world, the greatest need of the class struggle and the revolutionary people of the world, and the most sacred, glorious, and great battle task assigned by the times to every revolutionary soldier.

	Sun Liangting (Unit Commander) and Qi Qianzai (Chief of Staff): The great leader Chairman Mao is the savior of humanity and the hope of the world. We must take defending Chairman Mao as the greatest political cause of our lives, fighting for Chairman Mao in life and dedicating our lives to Chairman Mao in death. We must all be like the Heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, achieving "Defending Chairman Mao, dying is also willing!" We must use our greatest courage to defend Chairman Mao's highest leadership position, defending at all times, in all matters, in all places, for a lifetime, and for generations. Our hearts remain unchanged even if the heavens collapse and the earth shatters, with unwavering loyalty!

They vowed to carry on the spirit of the martyrs with actual actions and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

　　无限忠于毛主席　绝对坚信毛主席
　　永远紧跟毛主席　誓死捍卫毛主席
　　出席英雄四排和李文忠同志所在部队党委扩大会议的同志学习英雄事迹座谈纪要
    最近，出席“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠同志所在部队党委扩大会议的同志，怀着对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚的心情，学习了中央军委关于授予英雄四排和李文忠同志光荣称号的命令，听取了英雄四排和李文忠同志的事迹介绍，纷纷表示，一定要遵照伟大统帅毛主席“要斗私，批修”的教导，以英雄四排和李文忠同志为榜样，在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造世界观，做一个坚信毛主席一丝一毫不动摇，紧跟毛主席一分一秒不犹豫，捍卫毛主席赤胆忠心志不移的无产阶级革命战士。
　　坚信毛主席，一丝一毫不动摇
    在座谈中，大家被英雄四排的“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进”这四句钢铁誓言深深感动。一致认为，这四句话是英雄四排和李文忠同志无限忠于毛主席的高贵品质的集中表现。归结到一点，就是在他们的灵魂深处牢牢地树立了伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威。大家说，我们学英雄的思想，走英雄的道路，最最重要的，就是要象英雄四排和李文忠同志那样，绝对坚信毛主席，最刻苦地学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，最坚定地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，最彻底地改造自己的世界观。
    王立升（某部政委）：我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。全世界人民都把革命胜利的希望寄托在我们伟大领袖毛主席身上。我们坚信毛主席，就是对世界革命人民的无产阶级感情的最高体现，就是对共产主义事业的最大忠诚。我们要象英雄四排和李文忠同志那样，以最深厚的阶级感情无限热爱毛主席，永远坚信毛主席。过去是这样，现在是这样，将来还是这样，百年千年万年，永远这样！
    赵峰（部队长）：英雄四排的同志们有一个共同的信念：坚信毛主席的领导无比正确，坚信毛泽东思想威力无穷，坚信毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命一定胜利，这是他们能够在人类历史大变革的伟大时代创造出惊天动地的英雄事迹最根本的力量源泉，这是他们能够成为毛主席的好战士的根本保证。我们学习英雄四排和李文忠同志，就要象他们那样，阶级斗争越复杂、越激烈，越要跟好毛泽东思想，一切听从伟大统帅毛主席的指挥。不管遇到什么样的事情，坚信伟大领袖毛主席，坚信无产阶级司令部的决心，一丝一毫都不能动摇。
    要做到绝对坚信毛主席，就要活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，在灵魂深处爆发革命，在头脑里树立起毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威。一个干部“私”字多了，就会过于相信自己，自以为是，自作聪明，就会出错主意，办错事，给革命事业带来损失。要做一个最有水平最有觉悟的称职的领导干部，就必须大破“私”字，大立“公”字，真正做到心里只有毛主席，心里只有毛泽东思想，一个心眼跟毛主席干革命，一个意志跟毛主席走到底。
　　紧跟毛主席，一分一秒不犹豫
    在座谈中，大家一致认为，要做到对毛主席绝对信仰，无限忠诚，就要象英雄四排和李文忠同志那样，对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离。他们说，党委的领导，事情有千头万绪，情况有千变万化，但最重要最重要的就是要紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧跟以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部，做到闻风而动，雷厉风行，一分一秒也不犹豫。
    赵常秀（某部副政委）：在世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的伟大时代的今天，对毛主席的著作和最新指示，就是要拚命学，老老实实学，联系思想实际学，到群众的斗争中学。只有树立老老实实的态度，在“用”字上狠下功夫，才能深刻理解毛主席的指示，把毛主席的指示，每句话，每个字，化为自己的灵魂，指导自己的思想，支配自己的行动。这样，我们的心就会和毛主席越靠越近，我们的步伐就会跟毛主席越跟越紧，我们的事情就会越办越好。对一个领导干部来说，努力学好毛主席著作和最新指示，紧紧跟上伟大统帅毛主席，是一生高于一切的头等重要的大事情。我们就是要象英雄四排和李文忠同志那样，把学习毛主席著作，特别是活学活用“老三篇”，作为毕生的第一需要，在任何时候，任何情况下，都要摆在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的位置，自觉地用毛泽东思想来改造世界观，把自己的心炼成一颗永远不褪色的忠于毛主席的红心，做步步紧跟毛主席的好战士。
    孙好贞（某部副政委）：无限忠于毛主席，永远紧跟毛主席，就是要最忠实地执行毛主席的指示，扎扎实实地照毛主席的指示办事，做到毛主席怎样说，我们就怎样做，毛主席指向那里，我们就打到那里。伟大领袖毛主席是我们的最高司令，最高统帅，最高权威。对毛主席的每个指示，都要看作是最高的战斗命令，看作是指路的明灯，前进的方向，战斗的武器，胜利的源泉。一定要做到步步紧跟，一分一秒不犹豫；句句照办，一丝一毫不走样；字字落实，百分之百地兑现。忠不忠，看行动，对毛主席的指示理解的坚决执行，暂时不理解的，也要坚决执行。真正做到对伟大统帅毛主席的每一个伟大战略部署，每一个战斗号令，坚信不疑，坚定不移，坚决执行，圆满完成时代赋予我们的“三支”“两军”光荣任务。
    戴进田（某部副部队长）：紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，还必须把传播毛主席的声音放在一切工作的首位。毛主席的话水平最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。一个领导干部最大的责任，就是要以最快的速度传播毛主席的声音，以最大的热情宣传毛泽东思想。不管在何时何地，不管在什么情况下，对毛主席的最新指示，都要最及时、最迅速、原原本本、不折不扣地贯彻到部队中去，贯彻到群众中去，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想来统一部队指战员的意志和行动。这样，我们部队就会象英雄的四排那样，永远紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，天大的困难能克服，艰巨的任务能完成，黑风恶浪能顶住，任何强大的敌人也能战胜。
　　捍卫毛主席，赤胆忠心志不移
    在座谈中，大家一致认为，大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，誓死捍卫毛主席的最高领袖地位，是全世界无产阶级和革命人民的根本利益，是阶级斗争和世界革命人民的最大需要，是时代赋予每个革命战士的一项最崇高、最光荣、最伟大的战斗任务。
    孙亮亭（某部部队长）、亓谦斋（参谋长）：伟大领袖毛主席是人类的救星，世界的希望。我们要把誓死捍卫毛主席作为毕生最大最大的政治，生为毛主席战斗，死为毛主席献身。我们都要象英雄四排和李文忠同志那样，做到“保卫毛主席，死了也甘心！”我们要把最大的勇敢用在捍卫毛主席最高领袖地位上，时时捍卫、事事捍卫、处处捍卫，一生一世捍卫，世世代代捍卫。天崩地裂心不变，赤胆忠心志不移！
