Putting Chairman Mao's latest instructions into practical actions, the Jixi mining area presents a new revolutionary and productive landscape.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 10th: The broad revolutionary workers of the Jixi mining area in Heilongjiang Province, with the strong support and assistance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. They launch a mass movement of going up to the pit to carry out the revolution, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism; going down to the pit to carry out production, and producing more coal. This has brought about a new revolutionary and productive landscape in the entire mining area.

In November, the average daily coal production and the daily advance of excavation in the entire mining area increased significantly compared to the previous period. Since December, various production indicators have further increased compared to November. The average daily output of raw coal in the entire mining area exceeds the national plan by 8.8%, and the total excavation advance is 23.5% higher than the plan. Currently, a lively scene of surpassing each other has emerged among the various mines, shafts, and teams in this mining area, and the revolutionary and productive torrent is surging forward.

The Jixi Coal Mine is the largest coal mine in Heilongjiang Province. Most of the underground shafts in this mine are thin coal seams. In the past, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist mining management line. They used excuses such as "thin coal seams, small working faces, cannot produce high yields" to restrain the initiative of revolutionary workers in every possible way. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched, the broad revolutionary workers held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents. They eliminated all their poisonous influences, greatly emancipated the minds of the broad revolutionary workers, and enhanced their sense of responsibility as masters of the state. Revolutionary workers rushed to make new contributions in the great struggle of seizing the revolution and promoting production, driving the raw coal output of the entire mining area to continuously increase, and shattering the fallacy that "thin coal seams cannot produce high yields."

The broad revolutionary workers closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, and quickly achieve revolutionary great unity in the entire mining area based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, by system, by unit, and by team. They develop the revolutionary tripartite combination, and in the eleven coal mines of the entire mining area, nine have established revolutionary committees, effectively promoting the revolution and production.

Recently, the broad revolutionary workers in this mining area have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. They have held layer upon layer of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with everyone studying, lecturing, and applying the "Three Old Articles" extensively, studying and lecturing Chairman Mao's latest instructions extensively, and seriously ensuring the integration of learning and application, focusing on implementation. They have ensured that Chairman Mao's instructions are implemented item by item and have immediate effects. Since November 21st, the entire mining area has launched a new high tide of seizing the revolution and promoting production with "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key. The mines, shafts, and teams in the entire mining area have launched the "four comparisons and four observations" mass activity, that is, comparing the study of Chairman Mao's works, observing the immediate effects of active learning and application; comparing the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, observing the actions of eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit; comparing revolutionary enthusiasm, observing the completion of production tasks; comparing communist big cooperation, observing the creation of favorable conditions for each other, and seizing high coal output. The broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres regard producing more coal and better coal as a political battle against the Chinese Khrushchev and against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Everyone is full of vigor and enthusiasm and has thrown themselves into the battle to seize high coal output. Recently, the daily output of raw coal in the entire mining area has surged again and again, and the daily coal output of many mines has increased several times.

　　把毛主席的最新指示见之于实际行动
    鸡西矿区革命生产出现崭新面貌
    据新华社哈尔滨十日电　黑龙江省鸡西矿区广大革命职工，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的大力支持和帮助下，坚决落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，开展上井搞好革命，斗私批修；下井搞好生产，多产煤炭的群众运动，促使全矿区革命和生产出现了崭新面貌。
    十一月份，全矿区煤炭平均日产水平和掘进日进尺较前段时间有大幅度提高。十二月份以来，各项生产指标较十一月份又有增长，全矿区原煤平均日产量超过国家计划指标百分之八点八，掘进总进尺比计划提高百分之二十三点五。目前，这个矿区的各矿、井、队间出现了你超我赶的生动局面，革命和生产洪流滚滚向前。
    鸡西煤矿是黑龙江省最大的煤矿。这个矿的井下多是薄煤层。过去党内一小撮走资派推行一套反革命修正主义办矿路线，他们借口什么“煤层薄、掌子小，不能高产”，千方百计束缚革命职工的积极性。无产阶级文化大革命开展后，广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线展开大揭露、大批判、大斗争，清除其一切流毒和影响，极大地发扬了广大革命职工的无产阶级革命精神和国家主人翁的责任感。革命职工争先恐后地要在抓革命、促生产的伟大斗争中立新功，推动全矿区原煤产量不断提高，粉碎了“薄煤层不能高产”的谬论。
    广大革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以毛主席的最新指示为指针，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，迅速地实现了全矿区按系统、按单位、按班组的革命大联合，发展了革命三结合，全矿区十一个煤矿中已经有九个煤矿建立了革命委员会，有力地推动了革命和生产。
    最近，这个矿区的广大革命职工坚决响应毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，层层大办毛泽东思想学习班，人人大背、大讲、大用“老三篇”，大学、大讲毛主席的最新指示，认真做到学用结合，在用字上狠下功夫，使毛主席的指示项项落实，立竿见影。全矿区从十一月二十一日起，以“斗私，批修”为纲，掀起了抓革命、促生产的新高潮。全矿区矿与矿、井与井、队与队之间，展开“四比四看”群众活动，即比大学毛主席著作，看活学活用立竿见影；比斗私批修，看破私立公的行动；比革命干劲，看完成生产任务的情况；比共产主义大协作，看互相创造有利条件，夺取原煤高产。广大革命职工和革命干部把多出煤、出好煤，看作是向中国赫鲁晓夫，向帝修反发动攻击的政治仗，人人意气风发地投入了夺取煤炭高产的战斗。最近全矿原煤日产量一跃再跃，许多矿井日采煤量成倍增长。（附图片）
