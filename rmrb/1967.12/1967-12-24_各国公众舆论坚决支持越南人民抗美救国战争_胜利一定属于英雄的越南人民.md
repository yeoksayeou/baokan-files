The Asian-African Journalists Association Secretariat issued a statement on December 19th to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The statement said that the struggle of the South Vietnamese people and the North Vietnamese people against American aggression is not only related to the fate of the Vietnamese people but also to the interests of all the people in the world who are fighting for national independence and social liberation, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The heroic South Vietnamese people, adhering closely to the strategy of people's war, are defeating the largest imperialist and the number one enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism, and disrupting its counter-revolutionary global deployment.

The statement said that American imperialism, in collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership, in its recent so-called preparations for negotiations, has been attempting to play new "peace talks" tricks through the United Nations. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the sole true representative of the heroic South Vietnamese people, and the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnamese issue.
