Members of the First Brigade of Wengjiawan People's Commune in Luotian County, Hubei Province, closely combine the actual conditions of their brigade with the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. They have formulated a plan to conduct in-depth revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev in the countryside, determined to carry the struggle between the two roads and two lines in the countryside to the end. Their approach is to study one aspect of Chairman Mao's brilliant expositions and criticize one aspect of China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies. The main contents of their plan for specific topics of criticism are as follows:

1. Study Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural collectivization, criticize China's Khrushchev's crime of promoting "three freedoms and one contract," eliminate the poison of individual farming, consolidate the socialist collective economy, and develop collective production.

2. Study Chairman Mao's teachings on building socialism and communism, criticize China's Khrushchev's black goods of "exploitation is meritorious" and "four freedoms," eliminate capitalist behaviors such as speculation and profiteering, and further establish the resolve to firmly walk the socialist road.

3. Study Chairman Mao's teachings on believing in and relying on the majority of cadres and Chairman Mao's cadre policy, criticize China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique" on the cadre issue, eliminate the poison of "universal suspicion and universal rejection," and correctly handle cadres.

4. Study Chairman Mao's instructions on distribution, criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods on distribution, correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and do a good job in distribution work.

5. Study Chairman Mao's teachings on patriotism and internationalism, criticize China's Khrushchev's black goods of "three reductions and one annihilation" and "three reconciliations and one reduction," and establish the proletarian internationalist ideology of resolutely supporting the revolutionary struggles of the world's people.

6. Study Chairman Mao's instructions on political leadership, criticize China's Khrushchev's black goods of "money as the leader," "work points as the leader," and "material incentives," insist on emphasizing proletarian politics, and do a good job in political and ideological work.

7. Study Chairman Mao's great teachings of "selflessly serving others," criticize China's Khrushchev's bourgeois worldview of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," and establish the ideology of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, the collective, and the people.

8. Study Chairman Mao's teachings on the proletarian view of life and death, criticize China's Khrushchev's philosophy of fearing hardship and death, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, and carry the revolution through to the end.

9. Study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, criticize China's Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction," and establish the consciousness of never forgetting class struggle.

10. Study Chairman Mao's teachings on consolidating and strengthening proletarian dictatorship, criticize China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of shielding landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and inciting ghosts and snakes to swarm out in large numbers, and further establish the consciousness of never forgetting proletarian dictatorship.

Currently, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of this brigade are conducting in-depth revolutionary criticism according to these ten specific topics, in a planned and step-by-step manner.
