Albania has another piece of good news from its industrial front. The Stalingrad Asphalt Coking Plant, one of the projects in Albania's Fourth Five-Year Plan, recently began production and held an inauguration ceremony. This is another significant achievement in the Albanian working class's efforts to realize the revolutionization of national life and people's ideology, and to implement the policy of self-reliance in building socialism under the guidance of the Albanian Labor Party.

Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister Haki Toska attended the ceremony and cut the ribbon for the plant's inauguration.

Deputy Minister of Industry Hamiti spoke at the meeting, warmly congratulating the oil workers on their new achievements. A worker representative also spoke at the meeting.

The conference awarded the Labor Medal, issued by the Presidium of the People's Assembly, to fifty-six outstanding workers, technicians, and engineers who participated in the construction of this factory.

To break the economic blockade imposed by imperialism and revisionism on Albania, the workers of the Stalingrad Oil Refining Complex proposed, after the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party, to build an asphalt coking plant within six months. Building such a plant in such a short time is fraught with many difficulties. According to conventional practices, a construction project of this scale would take one to three years to be designed by a design unit. However, under the initiative of the workers, the construction of this plant adopted the method of collective effort, designing and constructing simultaneously. All the workers fully demonstrated their revolutionary enthusiasm and spirit of self-reliance, and finally, within just six months, completed the asphalt coking plant on schedule.

With the completion of this plant, the coke production of the Stalingrad Oil Refining Complex will increase by thirty-five to forty percent.

    实现思想革命化和贯彻自力更生方针又一显著成果
    阿尔巴尼亚斯大林城沥青炼焦厂投入生产
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚工业战线上又一喜讯传来。阿尔巴尼亚第四个五年计划的项目之一斯大林城沥青炼焦厂，不久前正式投入生产并举行了投产典礼。这是阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级遵循阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的教导，实现国家生活和人的思想革命化，贯彻自力更生建设社会主义方针的又一显著成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席哈基·托斯卡参加了典礼仪式并为这个厂的投产剪彩。
    阿尔巴尼亚工矿部副部长哈米蒂在会上讲话，热烈祝贺石油工人取得的新成就。工人代表也在会上讲了话。
    大会还把由人民议会主席团颁发的劳动奖章，授予五十六名参加建设这个工厂的优秀工人、技术员和工程师。
    为了粉碎帝国主义和修正主义对阿尔巴尼亚的经济封锁，斯大林城石油加工联合工厂的职工在劳动党五大以后就提出倡议，要在六个月内建成一座沥青炼焦厂。在这样短的时间内建成一座沥青炼焦厂，是有很多困难的。按常规的做法，这样一个建设项目交给设计单位设计需要一年到三年的时间。但是在工人们的倡议下，这座工厂的建设采取大家动手，边设计，边施工的办法进行。全体职工充分发挥了革命干劲和自力更生精神，终于在短短六个月的时间内，如期建成了这座沥青炼焦厂。
    由于这个厂的建成，使斯大林城石油加工联合企业焦炭的产量将增加百分之三十五到百分之四十。
