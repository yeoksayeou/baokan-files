The revolutionary workers of Fuxin Ping'an Coal Mine, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. They have resolutely implemented the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." The entire mine completed its annual coal production plan ahead of schedule by eleven days on December 20, with the average cost per ton of coal reduced by 3.6 percent compared to last year. Currently, the revolutionary workers of the entire mine are rallying their spirits under the battle cry of "produce more coal for the revolution." They are striving to increase production by an additional three million tons of coal for the state in the final ten days of this year.
