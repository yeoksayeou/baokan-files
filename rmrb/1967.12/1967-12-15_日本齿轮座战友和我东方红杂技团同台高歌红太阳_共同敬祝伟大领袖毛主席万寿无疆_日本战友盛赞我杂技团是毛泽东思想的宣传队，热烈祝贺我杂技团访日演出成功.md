On December 5, the Chinese Red East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe concluded their final performance in Kitakyushu, Kokura. Twenty or so Japanese friends, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and beating drums, ascended the stage. Leading them was a friend holding a large red paper with golden characters, on which was inscribed a letter of congratulations. In the upper right corner of the letter was a portrait of Chairman Mao. Following closely behind were friends holding a red banner with the words "Long Live Chairman Mao" and a portrait of Chairman Mao in the center.

These twenty or so Japanese friends were members of the Japanese Gear Seat Theater Troupe who had visited China on November 30. On this day, they specially traveled from Yamaguchi Prefecture to Kokura to watch the final performance of the Red East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe in Japan and to offer their congratulations.

As soon as the members of the Gear Seat Theater Troupe stepped onto the stage, they joined the Chinese acrobats in dancing the Yangge, celebrating the success of the acrobatic troupe's tour in Japan. They enthusiastically shouted that the success of the Red East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe's performance was a brilliant victory of the great thought of Mao Zedong, a bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a crystallization of the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

As the drumbeats subsided, the director of the Gear Seat Theater Troupe, Fujikawa Natsuko, filled with revolutionary fervor, said: "Before reading the letter of congratulations, let us first wish: Our heart's reddest red sun, the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, live ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

At this moment, about two hundred people had gathered on the stage, waving the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" in unison, enthusiastically shouting, "Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The comrades of the Gear Seat Theater Troupe wrote at the beginning of their letter of congratulations a quotation from Chairman Mao: "The people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The people of the world must have courage to fight, must not be afraid of difficulties and must advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed."

Fujikawa Natsuko said to the Red East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe: "You have come to Japan, braving the waves, to inspire the struggle of the Japanese people, bringing the proletarian revolutionary art of Chairman Mao. You are the propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought." At this moment, the stage resonated with the enduring shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

Fujikawa reported an exciting piece of news: "Since July this year, we have been in your country for four months. What we are most fortunate about is that on October 23 at 12:15, the great teacher of the people of the world, our heart's reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, received us." At this point, a comrade from the Gear Seat Theater Troupe raised his arm and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The entire stage waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," enthusiastically shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years! Wish Chairman Mao ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

On this day, on the stage celebrating the successful tour of the Red East Is Red Acrobatic Troupe in Japan, the comrades of the Gear Seat Theater Troupe performed some of the programs they had learned in China. The Japanese comrades sang revolutionary songs in clear Chinese, such as "Long Live Chairman Mao," and sang songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations in Japanese and Chinese: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory."

Finally, the Japanese friends performed the revolutionary song "Go All Out," and the comrades of the Gear Seat Theater Troupe choreographed a dance for it. When they sang "The struggle begins now...," an actor held up "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and the people followed behind, charging forward... Their performance reflected the Gear Seat Theater Troupe's comrades' determination to adhere to the political direction pointed out by Chairman Mao and resolutely follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

　　日本齿轮座战友和我东方红杂技团同台高歌红太阳
　　共同敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆
　　日本战友盛赞我杂技团是毛泽东思想的宣传队，热烈祝贺我杂技团访日演出成功
    十二月五日，中国东方红杂技团在北九州小仓结束最后一场访日演出时，二十几位日本朋友，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，敲着锣鼓，登上了舞台。走在最前面的朋友，高举着用大红纸写着金字的贺信，贺信的右上角，端端正正地镶着一张毛主席半身像。紧跟在后面的朋友，高举着一面写着“毛主席万岁”的红旗，红旗的正中央也镶着一张毛主席像。
    这二十几位日本朋友就是十一月三十日访华归来的日本齿轮座剧团的战友。这一天他们特地从山口县赶到小仓，观看了东方红杂技团的最后一次访日演出，并向杂技团祝贺。
    齿轮座剧团的演员一登上舞台，就同中国杂技演员一起跳起了秧歌舞，欢庆杂技团访日演出的成功。他们热情欢呼，东方红杂技团的演出成功是伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，是中日两国人民战斗友谊的结晶。
    锣鼓声刚刚停下来，齿轮座剧团团长藤川夏子满怀革命豪情地说：“在宣读贺信之前，首先让我们共同祝愿：我们心中最红最红的红太阳、全世界人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”
    这时，舞台上已经集聚了二百来人，他们一齐有节奏地挥动着红色宝书《毛主席语录》，热情高呼：“万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”
    齿轮座剧团的战友们在贺信的一开头写了一段毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    藤川夏子对东方红杂技团说：“你们为了鼓舞日本人民的斗争，乘风破浪来到日本，给日本人民带来了毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺。你们是毛泽东思想的宣传队。”这时，舞台上响起“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”的经久不息的欢呼声。
    藤川向大家报告了一个激动人心的消息说：“我们从今年七月起，在你们的祖国访问了四个月，最庆幸的是，十月二十三日十二点十五分，世界人民的伟大导师、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席他老人家接见了我们。”讲到这里时，齿轮座剧团的一位战友，振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”整个舞台上一齐挥动着《毛主席语录》，热情高呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！”
    这一天，在祝贺东方红杂技团访日演出胜利成功的舞台上，齿轮座剧团的战友们表演了他们从中国学习来的部分节目。日本战友们气壮山河地用清晰的中文演唱了《万岁，毛主席》等革命歌曲，并用日文、中文演唱了他们自己谱曲的毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    最后，日本朋友们演出了日本革命歌曲《加油干》，齿轮座剧团的战友们为《加油干》这支歌曲配上了舞蹈。当他们唱到“斗争从现在开始……”时，一个演员高举着《毛主席语录》，人们跟在后面，冲向前方……他们的表演反映了齿轮座剧团的战友们坚持毛主席指出的政治方向，坚决走毛主席指引的道路的决心。
