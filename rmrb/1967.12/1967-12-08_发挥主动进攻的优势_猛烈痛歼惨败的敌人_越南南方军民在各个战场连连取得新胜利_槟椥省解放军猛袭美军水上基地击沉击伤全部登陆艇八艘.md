The people's liberation armed forces in South Vietnam have continued to exploit the advantage of initiating offensive actions, launching fierce attacks against the enemy forces that have been routed, and achieving one victory after another on various battlefields in South Vietnam.

According to Western news agencies, the people's liberation armed forces in Binh Dinh Province, following their brilliant victories of annihilating an entire U.S. invasion army battalion and five companies of puppet troops in the Bu Dong military support area and airfield on November 28 and 29, launched a series of fierce attacks on the U.S. invasion forces here from November 30 to December 3, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy and causing heavy casualties. On November 30, the people's liberation armed forces south of the demilitarized zone launched a fierce attack on the U.S. invasion forces in the Khe Sanh area, annihilating nearly seventy U.S. Marines. On December 1, the people's liberation armed forces attacked a U.S. Marine "sweeping" unit in the Yeu Ling area and fiercely shelled enemy positions east of Yeu Ling, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers.

On the early morning of December 3, the people's liberation armed forces in Quang Ngai Province launched a fierce attack on the enemy "headquarters" in Phu My County, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Nearby U.S. invasion forces and South Korean mercenary troops, upon hearing the news, hurriedly dispatched troops to reinforce, but were also subjected to fierce attacks by the people's liberation armed forces, suffering heavy losses. On the night of December 1, the people's armed forces in Kon Tum Province again launched a fierce artillery attack on the U.S. invasion forces in the Dak To area, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers.

According to the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency reported that on the night of November 23 and the early morning of November 24, the people's liberation armed forces in Ben Tre Province launched a fierce attack on the U.S. Navy's water-based repair base at the mouth of the Ham Luong River, three kilometers southeast of Ben Tre City, sinking and damaging all eight landing craft and a large repair ship.

The report said that the enemy had heavily fortified this water-based base, with strongholds and bunkers on both banks, and a puppet army battalion stationed nearby, guarding day and night. The brave and clever liberation armed forces of Ben Tre Province suddenly attacked this base on the night of November 23, and after an hour of battle, sank and damaged all eight large and small landing craft in the base, and caused a massive explosion of ammunition and gasoline on a 200-meter-long giant ship, setting the ship's machinery and equipment ablaze.
