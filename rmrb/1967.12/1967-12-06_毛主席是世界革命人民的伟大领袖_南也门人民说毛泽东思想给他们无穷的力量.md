Chairman Mao is the Great Leader of the World's Revolutionary People
The People of South Yemen Say Mao Zedong Thought Gives Them Endless Strength

According to Xinhua News Agency, Aden, December 5th: The people of South Yemen, during their recent celebration of independence, expressed their boundless admiration and affection for the reddest red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao. They praised Chairman Mao as a great thinker of the proletarian revolution, saying that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the South Yemen people.

A soldier from the National Liberation Front told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "When we celebrate our victory, we will never forget the great support and encouragement given by the great leader Chairman Mao. Our revolution was carried out according to Chairman Mao's great thought of people's war, surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by force."

Six soldiers from the National Liberation Front in the Hadhramaut region specially sought out the Xinhua News Agency reporter at one o'clock in the morning to express their sincere and fervent love for the great leader Chairman Mao and the new China. One of the soldiers said, "On the 30th, during the celebration of independence in Hadhramaut, people held high the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. The people led by Chairman Mao have given us great support and encouragement, especially Mao Zedong Thought, which has given us endless strength. Before independence, British imperialism tried every means to prevent us from obtaining Chairman Mao's works, but we still risked our lives, crossing the British blockade, to deliver Chairman Mao's works to the frontline soldiers." This soldier took out a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from his pocket and meaningfully added, "You see, this book was obtained from a Chinese friend last year by crossing the blockade. Now the British imperialists have been driven out by us, but our struggle, our revolution, has not ended. The people there are eagerly and urgently awaiting more of Chairman Mao's works and his quotations." As the reporter left, the soldiers, touching the Chairman Mao badges on their chests, said, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, and we will forever love him."

In the past few days, many people from South Yemen have continuously asked Chinese friends for "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao badges. A South Yemen worker said, "Chairman Mao's books are easy to understand because they talk about revolutionary principles." A driver, after receiving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," read it all night until three in the morning. He said, "I read it word by word, sentence by sentence. I will study it repeatedly because Chairman Mao's books are the truths of revolution."

    毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖
    南也门人民说毛泽东思想给他们无穷的力量
    据新华社亚丁五日电  南也门人民在最近欢庆独立的时候，他们纷纷热情地表达对全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的无限敬仰和爱戴。他们称赞毛主席是伟大的无产阶级革命思想家，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是南也门人民的伟大领袖。
    一位民族解放阵线的战士对新华社记者说：“当我们庆祝我们的胜利时，我们永远不会忘记伟大领袖毛主席给我们的支持和鼓舞。我们的革命就是按照毛主席的农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的伟大的人民战争思想进行的。”
    六位从哈达拉毛地区来的民族解放阵线的战士，在深夜一点多钟特地找到新华社记者，热情而真挚地表达了他们对伟大领袖毛主席和新中国的热爱。其中一位战士说：“三十日在哈达拉毛庆祝独立时，人们高举伟大领袖毛主席的像。毛主席领导的中国人民给了我们很大的支持和鼓舞，特别是毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的力量。独立前，英帝国主义尽管千方百计地禁止我们得到毛主席著作，但是我们还是冒着生命危险，穿过英国封锁线，把毛主席的著作送到前线战士手里。”这位战士从兜里掏出一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》后，意味深长地接着说：“你看，这本书就是一年前我穿过封锁线从中国朋友那里得到的。现在英帝被我们赶走了，但是，我们的斗争，我们的革命并没有结束。我们那里的人们非常渴望和非常迫切地期待着更多更多的毛主席的著作和他的语录。”临别时，记者给他们戴上毛主席像章，战士们双手抚摸着胸前说：“毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，我们永远热爱他。”
    这几天，许多南也门人民络绎不绝地向中国朋友索取《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。一位南也门工人说：“毛主席的书一看就懂，因为他讲的都是革命的道理。”一位司机得到一本《毛主席语录》后，当天晚上一口气读到深夜三点，他说：“我是一个字一个字、一句一句地读的。我要反复地学习，因为毛主席的书都是革命的真理。”
