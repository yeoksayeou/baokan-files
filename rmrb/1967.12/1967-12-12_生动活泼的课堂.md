To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the school, as well as the activists among them—those proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Mao Zedong

In the past, under the protection of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, bourgeois intellectuals had long dominated our schools, implementing a revisionist educational line. They used the pretext of "systematicness," "completeness," and "inheriting the legacy" to stuff the classroom with many outdated, reactionary, pedantic, and impractical junk items. They vehemently opposed the study and application of Chairman Mao's poetry and writings. In the entire course on modern Chinese literature, only one unit was used to discuss two of Chairman Mao's poems, and even then, they were taught poorly and often distorted Chairman Mao's thoughts.

Our return to classes and revolution is to thoroughly criticize and reject this revisionist educational line and to establish a proletarian educational line. Based on the principles of linking theory with practice and focusing on quality over quantity, we have organized classes on Chairman Mao's poetry, educational revolution, and self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, in line with the current situation, tasks, and our professional characteristics.

How do we conduct these classes?

In the past, it was always the teacher lecturing and the students taking notes, using a cramming method that severely stifled the lively development of students' thoughts. Some bourgeois academic "authorities" used the lectern to spread poison, and students could only accept without criticism. They also used various examinations and tests to launch surprise attacks, severely damaging students' physical and mental health. We have criticized and abolished this old teaching method and examination system. Based on Chairman Mao's great thoughts of "self-education" and "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers," we have adopted a teaching method that combines self-study, group discussions, and collective classes. The class has established a restoration group composed of the class revolutionary committee, teachers, and student representatives to organize teaching. They synthesize the opinions of all classmates, formulate teaching plans, make arrangements, and propose requirements. Within a specified time, a topic is arranged for self-study, followed by group discussions based on self-study questions. Based on the discussions, the entire class has a collective class. The main speaker is elected by each group, and different opinions can be debated or supplemented in the classroom. The class duration is not fixed but focuses on solving problems. After class, students are required to summarize on their own. This breaks the dull atmosphere of the past classroom and makes it lively and vibrant. This fully mobilizes the students' enthusiasm and initiative in learning, cultivating their ability to think independently and solve practical problems. The classroom has become a democratic teaching classroom, with everyone spirited and the appearance completely renewed.

In studying Chairman Mao's poetry, students criticized the past reactionary academic "authorities" who equated Chairman Mao's poetry with that of feudal literati and used bourgeois ideas to guide their idealist interpretations. They also criticized those who focused only on artistic analysis, neglected the ideological content, and engaged in theoretical speculation and pedantic research. Students proposed principles and methods for studying Chairman Mao's poetry, such as combining it with Chairman Mao's other relevant works, using Chairman Mao's thoughts to study Chairman Mao's poetry, and using Chairman Mao's quotations to annotate Chairman Mao's poetry. They also proposed treating Chairman Mao's poetry as a great artistic practice of Chairman Mao and as the highest model of proletarian literature, and using it as a powerful ideological weapon to fight against selfishness and revisionism. This collective wisdom has raised classroom teaching to a new level.

In the process of returning to classes and revolution, teachers and students have taught, learned, helped, and criticized each other, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and jointly improving, establishing a brand-new teacher-student relationship.

　　生动活泼的课堂
　　北京师范大学中三（一）班革命学生
　　进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。
　　毛泽东
    过去，在党内最大的走资派的包庇下，资产阶级知识分子长期统治着我们的学校，推行修正主义教育路线。他们以知识的“系统性”、“完整性”以及“继承遗产”为借口，把许多大、洋、古的，反动的，烦琐的，脱离实际的破烂货，东拼西凑，通通塞进课堂。他们极端仇视毛泽东思想，千方百计反对我们活学活用毛主席的诗词文章。在整个现代文学史课中，只用了一个单元时间讲了两首毛主席诗词，而且讲得不伦不类，甚至对毛主席的思想肆意进行了歪曲。
    我们复课闹革命，就是要大破这种修正主义教育路线，大立无产阶级教育路线。我们根据理论要联系实际和少而精的原则，结合目前的形势和任务，以及我们的专业特点，开了毛主席诗词讲用课、教育革命课和斗私批修课。
    怎样开这些课呢？
    过去，从来都是教师讲，学生记，采取填鸭式的教学方法，严重束缚了学生的思想生动活泼的发展。一些资产阶级反动学术“权威”利用讲台大肆放毒，学生只能接受，不能批判。他们还利用名目繁多的考试测验制度，经常搞突然袭击，严重摧残了学生身心的健康。我们批判并且废除了这种旧的教学方法和考试制度，根据毛主席“自己教育自己”和“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的伟大思想，采取了以自学为主，自学、小组讨论、集体上课结合进行的教学方法。班内成立由班文革小组、教师、同学代表组成的复课小组，负责组织教学。他们综合全班同学的意见，制定教学计划，作出安排，提出要求。在规定时间内，安排一个专题，先让同学去自学，然后带着自学中的问题进行小组讨论，在讨论的基础上，全班集体上课。主讲人由各个小组推举，在课堂上有不同意见可以辩论，也可以补充。课时不拘长短，以解决问题为主。课后，要求同学自己作总结。这样就打破了过去课堂死气沉沉的局面，而变得生动活泼了。这样，就充分调动了同学们学习的积极性和主动性，培养了独立思考、解决实际问题的能力。课堂变成民主教学的课堂，人人精神振奋，面貌焕然一新。
    在学习毛主席诗词课时，同学们批判了过去一些反动学术“权威”把毛主席诗词与封建文人的诗词相提并论，以及用资产阶级思想作指导所作的唯心主义的解释，批判了那些只着重分析艺术性，不挖掘思想性，以及理论脱离实际、烦琐考证等资产阶级的文艺观点和研究方法。同学们提出了学习毛主席诗词要结合毛主席的其他有关著作来学习，以毛主席的思想来学习毛主席诗词，用毛主席语录来注解毛主席诗词；要把毛主席诗词当作毛主席的伟大艺术实践，当作无产阶级文艺的最高样板来学习；要联系实际，当作斗私批修的强大思想武器来学习等原则和方法。这样集思广益，把课堂教学提高到了一个新水平。
    在复课闹革命中，师生互教、互学、互帮、互相批评，取长补短，共同提高，建立了崭新的师生关系。
