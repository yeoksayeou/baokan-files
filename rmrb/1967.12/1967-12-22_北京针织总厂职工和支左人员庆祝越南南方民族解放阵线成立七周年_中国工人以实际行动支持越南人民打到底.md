The factory was filled with a spirit of struggle and unity.

A responsible person from the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Knitting Factory said at the celebration that Chairman Mao's telegram fully expressed the determination of all revolutionary workers and the Chinese people to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war. The heroic Vietnamese people, in their anti-American national salvation war, have united north and south, and with a common hatred for the enemy, have creatively demonstrated the immense power of people's war, repeatedly dealing heavy blows to the enemy and creating an unprecedentedly good situation. He, on behalf of all revolutionary workers in the factory, promised the Vietnamese comrades: To support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war, we will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, and with actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production, more powerfully support the Vietnamese people until the complete defeat of the American aggressors.

Our delegation expresses the deepest and most sincere thanks to the respected Chairman Mao, the great Communist Party of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the fraternal Chinese people on behalf of the 14 million people of South Vietnam.
