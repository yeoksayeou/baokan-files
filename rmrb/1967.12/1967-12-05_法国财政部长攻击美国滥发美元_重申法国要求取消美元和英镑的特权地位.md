In the midst of escalating currency wars among Western countries, French Finance Minister Michel Debré on November 30, at a ministerial-level meeting of the "Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development," once again attacked the United States for overissuing dollars, causing chaos in the capitalist world's monetary system. He also reiterated France's demand to abolish the special status of the dollar and the pound.

The "Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development," composed of 21 capitalist countries under U.S. control, recently held a ministerial-level meeting in Paris to discuss how to address the increasingly severe U.S. international trade deficit. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Walt W. Rostow's speech at the meeting indicated that the crisis-ridden Johnson administration intends to further shift its fiscal and economic difficulties onto its Western European partners. He stated that the United States would continue to export dollars to cover the trade deficit and demanded that its Western European partners bear more of the military burden for the United States, increase imports from the United States, and help the United States reduce its deficit.

French Finance Minister Michel Debré sharply criticized the U.S. for shifting the blame, and reiterated France's demand to abolish the special status of the dollar and the pound in the capitalist currency system. He said that the only way for the United States to solve its international trade deficit is to abolish the dollar and the pound as international reserve currencies. Debré said that due to the inflation of the dollar, people are increasingly doubting its value. He warned the United States that if it does not stop inflation, the current trend of capitalist countries dumping dollars and buying gold will continue.

The heated argument between Rostow and Debré once again shows that U.S. hegemony in the financial sphere of the capitalist world is declining, and contradictions among capitalist countries are intensifying.

    法国财政部长攻击美国滥发美元
    重申法国要求取消美元和英镑的特权地位
    新华社巴黎一日电　在西方国家货币战越演越烈的时候，法国财政部长德勃雷十一月三十日在“经济合作与发展组织”部长级会议上，再次攻击美国滥发美元使资本主义世界货币制度混乱，并且重申法国要求取消美元和英镑的特权地位。
    美国控制的二十一个资本主义国家组成的“经济合作与发展组织”最近在巴黎举行部长级会议，讨论如何弥补美国越来越严重的国际收支赤字问题。美国副国务卿罗斯托在会上的发言表明，危机重重的约翰逊政府企图进一步把财政经济困难转嫁给它的西欧伙伴。他表示，美国将继续采取输出美元的办法来弥补国际收支赤字，他要求美国的西欧伙伴替美国更多地负担军费，从美国增加进口，以帮助美国减少赤字。
    法国财政部长德勃雷对美国这种嫁祸于人的做法进行了尖锐的反击，并且重申法国要求取消美元和英镑在资本主义货币体系中的特权地位。他说，美国解决国际收支赤字的唯一办法是取消美元和英镑作为国际储备货币。德勃雷说，由于美元膨胀，人们越来越怀疑美元的价值。他威胁美国说，如果美国不停止通货膨胀，目前资本主义世界抛售美元抢购黄金的风潮将继续下去。
    罗斯托和德勃雷的激烈争吵再一次表明，美国在资本主义世界金融领域里的霸权日益衰落，资本主义国家之间的矛盾日益激化。
