Thousands of revolutionary masses from Heilongjiang Province and Harbin City held a grand meeting this afternoon to warmly welcome the heroic representatives of the people of South Vietnam, led by team leader Nguyen Van Long, who arrived here on the 23rd, and to enthusiastically celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The meeting venue was adorned with large banners reading: "Seven hundred million Chinese people swear to be the strong backing of the Vietnamese people!" "Firmly support the great anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people!" "Hail the new era of the world with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner!" "Long live the invincible and boundless Mao Zedong Thought!" After the meeting began, the first item on the agenda was the reading of the telegram from our great leader Chairman Mao to President Nguyen Huu Tho, which sparked wave after wave of thunderous applause throughout the venue.

Zhang Wanchun, a standing committee member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said, "The anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people has powerfully proven to the world the wise judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: 'Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated.' The great victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war have set a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world to achieve liberation."

Team leader Nguyen Van Long, in his speech, first introduced the honor of the delegation being received by our great leader Chairman Mao. He said that the warm care of Chairman Mao for the delegation made everyone extremely moved.

After introducing the great victories achieved by the people of South Vietnam in their anti-American national salvation war, Nguyen Van Long said, "No matter if the war lasts five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, the people of South Vietnam are determined to fight to the end until the American aggressors are thoroughly driven out of South Vietnam."

The Harbin City Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, and the preparatory committee of the Red Guards of colleges and universities and middle schools made a joint statement at the meeting.

Wang Zhucuan, vice chairman of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said: The great victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war prove that the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated," are completely unshakable truths. He said, no force can stop the heroic Vietnamese people from achieving complete victory.

Vice team leader Son Luc of the South Vietnamese People's Delegation reported to the revolutionary masses the joyous news of the delegation being received by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin.
