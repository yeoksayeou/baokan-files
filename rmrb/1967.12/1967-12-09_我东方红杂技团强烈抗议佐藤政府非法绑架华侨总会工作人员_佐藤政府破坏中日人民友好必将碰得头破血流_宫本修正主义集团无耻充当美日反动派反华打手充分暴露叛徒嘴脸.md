The Chinese East Red Acrobatic Troupe strongly protests the Sato government's illegal abduction of the Chinese Overseas Federation staff. The Sato government's destruction of Sino-Japanese friendship will inevitably lead to a bloody end. The Miyamoto revisionist group shamelessly acts as the henchmen of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, fully exposing their traitorous faces.

New China News Agency, Tokyo, December 7th: The Chinese East Red Acrobatic Troupe, which is currently visiting Japan for performances, held a press conference in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 7th and issued a statement strongly protesting the wild and barbaric act of the Japanese Sato reactionary government in illegally abducting Chen Xuequan, a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese Overseas Federation.

The statement said that on the morning of December 4th, the Japanese police, under the pretext of being involved in a "suspicion of injury" in Iwakizawa City, actually dispatched plainclothes police to abduct Chen Xuequan, a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese Overseas Federation, on the street. They secretly and sneakily "escorted" him by plane to Hokkaido for detention, and he has not been released to this day.

The statement said that Chen Xuequan, a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese Overseas Federation, was assisting the work during the visit of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe to Japan. During the performance of the Chinese East Red Acrobatic Troupe in Iwakizawa, Sapporo, and other places in Hokkaido, the Miyamoto revisionist group repeatedly and outrageously caused disturbances and sabotage. The Japanese police authorities not only did not stop them but also condoned and protected them. They distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, and framed Chen Xuequan, a patriotic overseas Chinese, with various fabricated charges, carrying out political persecution. This is obviously a serious anti-China political incident fabricated by the Japanese government authorities in collusion with the Miyamoto revisionist group. We express our utmost indignation and strongly protest against the Japanese government.

The statement said that the incident of the Japanese government authorities persecuting Chen Xuequan is not isolated and accidental. Recently, after the Japanese Prime Minister's visit to the United States, he brought the political corpse Chiang Kai-shek, who has long been despised by the Chinese people, to Japan to engage in anti-China activities; against the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox headquarters), which insists on Sino-Japanese friendship and invited the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe to visit Japan this time, and the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and the Kansai headquarters of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, which have made great efforts to support the visit and performance of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe, the Japanese government has carried out fascist atrocities such as searches. This is a new and serious step taken by the Japanese government in its long-standing pursuit of following U.S. imperialism, opposing China, and intensifying the destruction of the Sino-Japanese people's friendship movement and Sino-Japanese friendly trade. The statement said, we warn the Japanese government authorities, the 700 million Chinese people are not to be trifled with. You are willing to be the faithful lackeys of U.S. imperialism, and your outrageous anti-China actions will have no good outcome. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The lackeys who are determined to be led by the nose by U.S. imperialism will ultimately be buried by U.S. imperialism."

The statement pointed out that the Miyamoto revisionist group, in the frenzied anti-China activities of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, has acted as a henchman. The Miyamoto revisionist group is terrified and hates the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, doing everything possible to sabotage the increasingly developing Sino-Japanese people's friendship movement. They bark and howl like mad dogs at the visit and performance of the East Red Acrobatic Troupe in Japan, engaging in shameless sabotage and disruption. They even openly collude with the Japanese police authorities to slander and frame Chen Xuequan, a staff member of the Tokyo Chinese Overseas Federation, fully exposing the traitorous faces of the Miyamoto revisionist group in their anti-China, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary revisionism.

The statement said that we firmly support the protest statement of the Tokyo Chinese Overseas Federation. The Japanese police authorities must immediately release Chen Xuequan, the patriotic overseas Chinese who was illegally abducted.

The statement finally pointed out that promoting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan and promoting economic and cultural exchanges between our two peoples is the common wish of the peoples of China and Japan, an irresistible historical trend that no force can destroy. Whoever tries to obstruct and destroy the friendship between our two peoples will inevitably be met with a bloody end.

    我东方红杂技团强烈抗议佐藤政府非法绑架华侨总会工作人员
    佐藤政府破坏中日人民友好必将碰得头破血流
    宫本修正主义集团无耻充当美日反动派反华打手充分暴露叛徒嘴脸
    新华社东京七日电　正在日本进行访问演出的中国东方红杂技团七日下午在东京举行的记者招待会上发表声明，强烈抗议日本佐藤反动政府非法绑架东京华侨总会工作人员陈学全的野蛮罪行。
    声明说，十二月四日上午，日本警察当局借口所谓与岩见泽市的“伤害嫌疑”有关，竟然出动便衣警察在大街上非法绑架了东京华侨总会工作人员陈学全，偷偷摸摸地用飞机“押送”到北海道关押起来，至今尚未释放。
    声明说，东京华侨总会工作人员陈学全，是在中国杂技团访日演出期间随团协助工作的。当中国东方红杂技团在北海道岩见泽、札幌等地演出期间，宫本修正主义集团一再猖狂地进行捣乱和破坏，对此，日本警察当局不仅未予制止，反而加以纵容和包庇。他们颠倒是非，混淆黑白，给爱国侨胞陈学全加上种种莫须有的罪名，进行政治迫害。这显然是日本政府当局与宫本修正主义集团狼狈为奸制造的一个严重的反华政治事件。在此，我们对日本政府表示极大的愤慨和提出强烈的抗议。
    声明说，日本政府当局迫害陈学全的事件，并不是孤立的和偶然的。最近以来，日本首相访美回国之后，把被中国人民早已唾弃的政治僵尸蒋匪帮头目蒋经国拉到日本进行反华活动；对于坚持日中友好、这次邀请中国杂技团访日的日中友好协会（正统）总部和致力于发展日中贸易、对中国杂技团访问演出大力支持的日本国际贸易促进协会及日本国际贸易促进协会关西总部等团体则实行搜查等法西斯暴行。这是日本政府一贯追随美帝国主义敌视中国、加紧破坏中日两国人民友好运动和中日友好贸易的一个新的严重步骤。声明说，我们正告日本政府当局，七亿中国人民决不是好惹的，你们甘心充当美帝国主义的忠实走卒，猖狂反华，是绝对没有好下场的。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”
    声明指出，宫本修正主义集团在美日反动派疯狂反华的活动中，充当了打手。宫本修正主义集团对战无不胜的毛泽东思想怕得要死，恨得要命，千方百计地破坏日益发展的日中两国人民友好运动。它们对东方红杂技团的访日演出，象疯狗一样狂吠嚎叫，进行无耻的捣乱和破坏。它们竟公然同日本警察当局勾结在一起，诬蔑陷害东京华侨总会工作人员陈学全，这就完全暴露了宫本修正主义集团反华、反人民、反革命的修正主义叛徒嘴脸。
    声明说，我们坚决支持东京华侨总会的抗议声明。日本警察当局必须立即释放被非法绑架的东京华侨总会工作人员、爱国华侨陈学全。
    声明最后指出，增进中日两国人民友好，促进我们两国人民的经济、文化交流，是中日两国人民的共同的愿望，是不可抗拒的历史洪流，是任何力量也破坏不了的。谁想阻挠和破坏我们两国人民的友谊，谁就必将碰得头破血流。
