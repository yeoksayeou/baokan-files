Rome and other cities in Italy have seen anti-U.S. demonstrations erupt. Protesters held up signs reading "Johnson, go back!" frightening the U.S. imperialist chief who dared not ride in a car through the city streets.

	New York, December 24th – People in the Italian capital of Rome and in cities such as Siena, Modena, Forlì, and Trieste held demonstrations on the 23rd to oppose U.S. aggression against Vietnam and to express strong protest against the arrival of the U.S. imperialist chief, Johnson.

	Johnson arrived secretly in Rome by airplane in the evening of the 23rd after recently attending the funeral of Australian Prime Minister Holt in Melbourne and visiting South Vietnam to boost the morale of the U.S. invasion forces, which were being badly beaten.

	Despite the Italian authorities keeping the exact date of Johnson's arrival a strict secret, the entire city of Rome was still plastered with large anti-Johnson slogans on that day. Large crowds held up signs reading "Johnson is a butcher!" and "Johnson, go back!" and held demonstrations in the city center.

	Johnson only stayed in Italy for a total of four hours, but the Rome authorities took unprecedented strict security measures for his arrival: large numbers of plainclothes police and officers were concentrated around the airport and the U.S. embassy, and many streets in Rome were blocked off with police cars. However, Johnson was still terrified and shaking with fear. To avoid the protesting crowds, he dared not ride in a car and could only use a helicopter for his comings and goings, not daring to ride in a car through the city streets.

    坚决反对美帝侵略越南　强烈抗议瘟神约翰逊入境
    意大利首都罗马等城市爆发反美示威
    示威者高举“约翰逊滚回去”标语，吓得美帝头子不敢坐汽车在市内经过
    新华社二十四日讯罗马消息：意大利首都罗马以及锡耶纳、摩德纳、弗利、的里雅斯特等一系列城市的群众，二十三日分别举行了反对美国侵略越南的示威，向途经意大利回国的美帝国主义头子约翰逊表示强烈抗议。
    约翰逊是在最近到墨尔本为澳大利亚总理霍尔特送葬和到南越给被打得狼狈不堪的美国侵略军“打气”之后，在二十三日傍晚乘飞机悄悄到达罗马的。
    尽管意大利当局事前对约翰逊到达的确切日期严加保密，但是罗马全城在这一天仍然贴满了反对约翰逊的大字标语。大批群众举着“约翰逊是刽子手！”“约翰逊滚回去！”等标语牌，在市中心举行了示威游行。
    约翰逊在意大利总共只逗留了四小时，但罗马当局为约翰逊的到来采取了空前严格的保安措施：在飞机场和美国大使馆四周集中了大批便衣和警察，并且用警车封锁了罗马市内的许多街道。可是约翰逊仍然胆战心惊，怕得要死。为了避开示威群众，他出入都只敢乘直升飞机，根本不敢乘汽车经过市内的街道。
