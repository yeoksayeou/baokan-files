The broad masses of cadres and soldiers in the Navy are determined to take Comrade Lin Biao's calligraphy as their guiding principle and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights. They will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's military thinking and line for building the army, turning the Navy into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought and building it into an impregnable sea wall.

Representatives attending the Navy's first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works came to the capital—Beijing—with boundless love for the great helmsman, Chairman Mao. In the picture, Guan Jiaxi (right one), Mai Xiande (right two), Gao Xiang (back row center), Cui Fuxun (right three), and Zheng Chunlan (female) are standing on the Golden Water Bridge, gazing with deep respect at the giant portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on Tiananmen Gate.

The Party Committee of the "Sea and Air Eagles Regiment" insists on using Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbook in all political education and military theory training. They use Mao Zedong Thought to guide military and political training. This is First-Class Hero Wang Hongxi sharing his experiences of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide his flying and combat with new comrades.

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers, armed with the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, are vigilantly guarding the coastal defenses of the motherland. This is the anti-aircraft artillery unit's cadres and soldiers on the front line of the South China Sea, diligently training their combat skills, ready at any moment to annihilate the invading enemy.

The Party Committee of a certain fast boat squadron in the Navy is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They take "Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism" as their guiding principle, focusing on transforming their worldview. In the struggle between the two lines and in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, they have stood firmly and achieved one victory after another, becoming a red flag in the Navy that bravely defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The cadres and soldiers of the "Sea Tiger Boat" use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely attack armed enemies, fiercely criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and fiercely fight against the "self" in their minds. They are determined to follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao, steadfastly advancing through the storms of class struggle!

The cadres and soldiers of the Navy's 4220 Unit place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. This is the cadres and soldiers writing Chairman Mao's quotations as the first item of preparation before setting out on a mission at sea.

    大海航行靠舵手  干革命靠毛泽东思想
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。海军广大指战员决心把林副主席的题词作为座右铭，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮，坚决执行毛主席的军事思想和建军路线，把海军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，建设成为坚固的海上长城。
    出席海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表们，怀着对伟大舵手毛主席无限热爱的心情来到首都——北京。图中是关加溪（右一）、麦贤得（右二）、高翔（后排中）、崔福俊（右三）、郑春兰（女）等在金水桥上，怀着无限崇敬的心情仰望高挂在天安门城楼上的毛主席巨幅画像。
    “海空雄鹰团”党委坚持在一切政治教育和军事理论科目训练中，都以毛主席著作为基本教材，用毛泽东思想统帅军、政训练。这是一等功臣王鸿喜在向新战友讲述用毛泽东思想指导自己飞行和战斗的体会。
    用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大指战员，百倍警惕地守卫在祖国的海防线上。这是守卫在南海前哨的高炮部队指战员们正在苦练杀敌本领，时刻准备消灭来犯的敌人。
    海军某快艇支队党委，无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓世界观的改造。在两条路线斗争中，在“三支”“两军”工作中，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，取得了一个又一个的胜利，成为海军部队一面英勇捍卫毛主席革命路线的红旗。

    “海上猛虎艇”指战员们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对拿枪的敌人猛打，对党内一小撮走资派猛批，对头脑里的“私”字猛斗。决心紧跟伟大舵手毛主席，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里坚定不移地破浪前进，永远前进！
    海军四二二○部队指战员们，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置。这是指战员们在做出海执行任务前的第一项准备工作：写毛主席语录。　（本版照片除署名者外都是新华社记者陈　捷、韩来顺、刘兴立　摄）
