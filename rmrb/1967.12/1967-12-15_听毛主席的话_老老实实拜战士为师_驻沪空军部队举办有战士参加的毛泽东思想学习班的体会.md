The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Military training classes must include soldiers." The Shanghai Air Force Party Committee promptly took action, diligently studied and discussed, and resolutely implemented this directive. Currently, all subordinate units have held two to three sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldiers participating. Their experiences are as follows:

Starting with the fundamental attitude, educating cadres to be humble students of the masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, see for themselves, adhere to the mass line, and consult with the masses on everything. Be a student of the masses." The inclusion of soldiers in study classes requires cadres to have the correct attitude and be willing to be humble students. To enhance everyone's understanding of the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, many study class leaders organized repeated study sessions on Chairman Mao's teachings regarding the mass line and superior-subordinate relationships. This helped cadres realize that having soldiers participate in military training classes is a necessity for the Cultural Revolution and class struggle. It is crucial for improving officer-soldier relations, criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and achieving the thought reform of cadres. Therefore, every cadre must look down, lower their status, learn from the soldiers, and be humble students of the masses. They must wholeheartedly, respectfully, and sincerely learn from the soldiers, achieving unity in study, labor, life, entertainment, and duty. Through study and practice, cadres' understanding gradually improved, and their self-awareness increased. They could correctly treat themselves, correctly treat the masses, and actively approach the soldiers, humbly listening to the soldiers' opinions. Cadres and soldiers mutually cared for each other in their studies, helped each other in their thoughts, and took care of each other in their lives, greatly enhancing the cadres' sense of the masses and fostering a good democratic style. A new situation of unprecedented harmony and unity emerged between cadres and soldiers. At the same time, soldiers also learned the fine traditions of our army from the cadres.

Experience has shown that to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must first solve the fundamental attitude problem of cadres, making them realize that whether they can humbly learn from the masses and be students of the masses is a major issue concerning loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and whether they can forever retain their revolutionary youth.

Addressing active thoughts, mobilizing soldiers to help cadres criticize and repudiate revisionism

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes," and "in a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." Everyone believes that the broad masses of soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have red hearts and bright eyes. They understand the situation of cadres the best, see the strengths and weaknesses of cadres most comprehensively, and care the most about the political progress of cadres. Cadres studying together with soldiers, exposing their thoughts to the masses, gaining the masses' help, and drawing nourishment from the masses is an important guarantee for cadres to achieve thought reform.

In the process of joint study and joint criticism and repudiation of revisionism, some cadres and soldiers had some active thoughts. Cadres were mainly afraid of losing face and losing authority, not daring to boldly expose their thoughts and unable to consciously fight against the "self." Soldiers were mainly afraid of not speaking to the point or not speaking reasonably, not daring to boldly criticize cadres. To address these active thoughts, the unit party committee organized cadres and soldiers to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "Opposing Liberalism," encouraging everyone to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, arousing cadres' awareness of criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and enhancing soldiers' sense of political responsibility. Many units also carried out various forms of activities such as "Red Pair," further improving the understanding and attitude of cadres and soldiers. A company commander, Zhao Lijun, actively paired with soldiers who had more opinions about him during the study, humbly accepting the soldiers' help. A political department director, Ma Wenzi, actively sought the opinions of soldiers studying in the class, consciously exposing his thoughts, fighting against selfishness, deeply touching his soul, and making a profound self-criticism, solving long-standing issues. Everyone praised him for openly and fiercely criticizing and repudiating revisionism.

The unit party committee believes that mobilizing soldiers to help cadres break away from selfishness and establish public-mindedness requires focusing on major issues. Some soldiers, due to less contact with leading cadres in daily life, do not fully understand the situation of cadres in major issues and often focus on minor life matters when giving opinions to cadres. To address this situation, they continuously guided soldiers to focus on the attitudes of cadres towards Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, helping cadres fiercely fight against selfishness, deeply touch their souls, and firmly grasp the transformation of their worldview. Soldiers said: "Helping cadres from the perspective of major issues is the greatest care and help for cadres." Cadres said: "The soldiers' help is tremendous. Every opinion hits our pain points and helps us to the heart, making us convinced."

Masses run the school, open the school

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses have limitless creativity." We must trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. We must mobilize the masses to revolutionize, educate, manage, and liberate themselves. The Shanghai Air Force Party Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings, insisted on the mass line of coming from the masses and going to the masses, allowing the masses to come up with ideas and methods, educate themselves, and liberate themselves, creating many lively and vivid learning forms.

Masses run the school. In the study class, everyone is a student, and everyone is a teacher. Whoever studies Mao Zedong's works well and applies them skillfully, whoever fights against selfishness bravely and thoroughly, is the teacher. From formulating the study plan, conducting study evaluations, exchanging study experiences, to the final summary, all are discussed and decided by the masses. During the study, when the masses have problems or active thoughts, they solve them through lectures, discussions, and heart-to-heart talks. They say: "We know our own problems best. We choose our own targets and find our own weapons. Problems are solved the fastest and most thoroughly." The study class absorbs soldiers to participate in study groups and study class leadership, further mobilizing soldiers' enthusiasm and more effectively helping cadres criticize and repudiate revisionism.

Open the school. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Studying Marxism, not only from books, mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the workers and peasants, can truly learn." To better learn from the workers and peasants, some units adopted the approach of going out of the barracks and offices, moving the study class to factories, villages, and companies, widely approaching the masses, learning from the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary youngsters, and soldiers, exchanging learning experiences, and jointly discussing the great situation of the Cultural Revolution. Some cadres, to better criticize and repudiate revisionism, also returned to their units to widely seek the masses' opinions.

Because the broad masses were mobilized, many effective learning forms were created, making the study class lively and vibrant, presenting a political situation that is "both concentrated and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified will and individual comfort, lively and vibrant."

Currently, the Shanghai Air Force is further studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on military training classes including soldiers, summarizing the experiences of the previous stage of study classes including soldiers, and proposing measures to further improve the study classes. They are determined to vigorously carry out Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldiers participating, accelerate the thought reform of cadres, and turn the unit into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

### 听毛主席的话　老老实实拜战士为师——驻沪空军部队举办有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班的体会

　　听毛主席的话　老老实实拜战士为师
　　——驻沪空军部队举办有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班的体会
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“军队办学习班要有战士参加。”驻上海空军部队党委闻风而动，认真学习讨论，坚决贯彻执行。现在，所属部队都举办了两到三期有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班。他们的体会是：
　　从解决根本态度入手，教育干部甘当群众的小学生
    毛主席教导我们：“干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”学习班吸收战士参加，这就要求干部要有正确的态度，要有甘当小学生的精神。为了提高大家对毛主席这一最新指示的伟大意义的认识，许多学习班领导，组织大家反复学习毛主席有关群众路线、上下级关系的教导，使干部认识到，军队办学习班要有战士参加，这是文化大革命的需要，阶级斗争的需要，对进一步搞好官兵关系，斗私批修，实现干部的思想革命化，具有深远的战略意义。因此，每个干部必须眼睛向下，放下架子，拜战士为师，甘当群众的小学生，满腔热情、恭恭敬敬、老老实实地向战士学习，做到和战士同学习，同劳动，同生活，同娱乐，同值勤。通过学习和实践，干部认识逐步提高，自觉性逐步增强，能够正确地对待自己，正确地对待群众，主动地和战士接近，虚心听取战士的意见。干部战士学习上互相关心，思想上互相帮助，生活上互相体贴，大大增强了干部的群众观念，养成了良好的民主作风，干部战士之间出现了空前融洽、空前团结的新局面。同时，战士也从干部身上，很好地学到了我军的优良传统。
    经验证明：要坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，首先要解决干部的根本态度问题，要使干部认识到，能不能虚心地向群众学习，甘当群众的小学生，是关系到忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，能不能永葆革命青春的大问题。
    抓好活思想，发动战士帮助干部斗私批修
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”，“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”大家认为，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大战士，心红眼亮，对干部情况最了解，对干部的优缺点看得最全面，对干部政治上的进步最关心。干部同战士在一起学习，把自己的思想同群众见面，取得群众的帮助，从群众中吸取营养，这是干部实现思想革命化的重要保证。
    在共同学习、共同斗私批修的过程中，有的干部、战士存在着一些活思想。干部主要怕丢面子，怕失威信，不敢大胆暴露思想，不能自觉地狠斗“私”字。战士主要是怕讲不到点子上，讲不出道道来，不敢大胆地对干部提出批评。针对这些活思想，部队党委组织干部战士学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》，发动大家忆苦思甜，启发干部斗私批修的自觉性，提高战士的政治责任感。许多单位还开展了“一对红”等多种形式的活动，使干部战士进一步提高了认识，端正了态度。某部连长赵立俊，在学习中主动找平时对自己意见较多的战士结成“一对红”，虚心接受战士的帮助。某团政治处主任马文责，主动地征求在学习班学习的战士的意见，自觉地亮思想，斗私心，狠触灵魂，作了深刻的自我批评，解决了长期没有解决的问题。大家称赞他对“私”字“亮得透，斗得狠，批得深”。
    部队党委认为，发动战士帮助干部破私立公，要抓大节。有的战士由于平时和领导干部接触较少，对干部大节方面的情况了解不够，对干部提意见，往往偏重于生活上的小事。针对这种情况，他们不断地启发引导战士抓住干部对待毛主席、毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的态度问题，帮助干部狠斗私心，狠触灵魂，狠抓世界观的改造。战士们说：“从大节着眼帮助干部，才是对干部最大的爱护，最大的帮助。”干部们说：“战士们对我们的帮助太大了，条条意见戳到我们的痛处，帮到我们的心里，使我们心服口服。”
    群众办学，开门办学
    毛主席教导我们：“人民群众有无限的创造力”，要信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。要放手发动群众，让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己管理自己，自己解放自己。驻上海空军部队党委遵照毛主席的教导，坚持从群众中来、到群众中去的群众路线，让群众自己出主意想办法，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，创造出了许多生动活泼的学习形式。
    群众办学。在学习班里人人是学员，人人是教员。谁学毛主席著作学得好，用得活，谁斗私斗得勇敢，斗得彻底，谁就是老师。从制订学习计划，进行学习讲评，交流学习经验，到最后总结，都由群众自己讨论商定。学习中，群众有了问题，有了活思想，通过讲用会、座谈、谈心等形式，由群众自己来解决。他们说：“自己对自己的问题最清楚，自己选靶子，自己找武器，问题解决得最快，最彻底。”学习班吸收战士参加学习小组和学习班的领导工作，更大地调动了战士的积极性，更有利于帮助干部斗私批修。
    开门办学。毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”为了更好地向工农群众学习，有的部队采取了走出营房，走出机关，把学习班搬到工厂、农村、连队去办，广泛地接近群众，向广大无产阶级革命派、贫下中农、革命小将和战士学习，互相交流学习经验，共同畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，共同开斗私批修讲用会。有的干部为了更好地斗私批修，还回到本单位广泛地征求群众的意见。
    由于广大群众发动起来了，创造了许多行之有效的学习形式，使学习班办得生动活泼，热气腾腾，出现了一个“又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼，那样一种政治局面”。
    目前，驻上海空军部队进一步学习毛主席关于军队办学习班要有战士参加的最新指示，对前一阶段办学习班吸收战士参加的经验进行了总结，提出了进一步办好学习班的措施，决心大力办好有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班，加速干部思想革命化，把部队办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
