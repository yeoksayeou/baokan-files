The revolutionary rebels at the Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory were overjoyed when the Fourth Platoon expressed support for them. "Now we've really won!" they exclaimed. Just at that moment, Li Wen Zhong seized the opportunity to address their thoughts—

	Arm the Revolutionary Rebels with Mao Zedong Thought

	Studying the works of Chairman Mao should be done with questions in mind, applying them actively and practically, learning and using them together, learning urgently what is needed immediately, and seeing results right away. We must focus on the "use" of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Lin Biao

	The army entered the Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory in Jiangxi and, after thorough investigation and research, firmly and clearly supported the proletarian revolutionary rebels in the factory.

	In recent days, some of the revolutionary rebels have been jumping and singing, completely immersed in their victory. They said, "Now things are good! Chairman Mao has sent the People's Liberation Army to support us, and we have won!" The joy of the revolutionary rebels greatly infected Li Wen Zhong. He was happy, but he also felt that amidst these joyful voices, there was a thought trend that needed attention.

	That evening, Li Wen Zhong went to the patrol team of the revolutionary rebels and had a heart-to-heart talk with them. The revolutionary rebels angrily exposed and denounced how a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party had, for many years, pushed the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev, restored capitalism in the factory, stubbornly carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, and sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Li Wen Zhong said, "Yes! If it weren't for Chairman Mao's far-sighted leadership, personally initiating and leading us to carry out the Cultural Revolution, our country would really have changed color." A revolutionary rebel said, "Comrade, ever since you arrived, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party have been deflated. With the support of the People's Liberation Army, they won't be able to stage a comeback. Right?" Li Wen Zhong did not immediately respond. After a long pause, he said, "Comrades, at present, a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed. We have achieved great victories. But we must never forget Chairman Mao's teachings: 'We must not, because of our victories, relax our vigilance against the cunning and desperate plots of the imperialists and their running dogs. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be disarmed politically and placed in a passive position.' Comrades, do you agree?" The revolutionary rebels' hearts were suddenly enlightened. "Comrade Li Wen Zhong," said a revolutionary rebel, "Tonight, you not only rang the alarm for us, but more importantly, you educated us and armed us with Mao Zedong Thought." Comrade Li Wen Zhong said, "We must closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao and constantly use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to examine ourselves. Only in this way can we ensure victory on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Right!" said the revolutionary rebels. "We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: 'The victory of the revolution is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the struggle is more arduous.' We must carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, thoroughly criticize and expose a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, fight them to the end, and make them stink for a thousand years, never to rise again!"

	The eastern sky brightened, and the red sun rose. Li Wen Zhong and the revolutionary rebels, facing the sunrise, took more determined steps forward.

　　棉纺织印染厂的革命造反派见四排支持他们，都高兴地说：这下可好了，我们胜利了！就在这时候，李文忠抓住活思想——
　　用毛泽东思想武装革命造反派
    学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
　　林彪
    部队进驻江西棉纺织印染厂，经过细致深入的调查研究，立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地支持了这个厂的无产阶级革命派。
    这些天来，革命造反派中有些战士，跳呀，唱呀，完全沉醉在胜利之中了。他们说：“这下可好了！毛主席派来的亲人解放军坚决支持我们，我们胜利了！”革命造反派的喜悦，大大感染了李文忠。他高兴，但又觉得在这些欢乐声中，有一种思想苗头，值得注意。
    晚上，李文忠来到革命造反派的巡逻队，同他们谈心。革命造反派愤怒揭发和控诉了党内一小撮走资派多年来推行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义办厂路线，在厂里复辟资本主义，顽固执行资产阶级反动路线，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的种种罪行。李文忠说：“是啊！要不是毛主席他老人家高瞻远瞩，亲自发动和领导咱们起来搞文化大革命，我们的国家真要改变颜色了。”革命造反派的战士说：“同志，你们一来，党内一小撮走资派就撒了气了。有解放军支持我们，他们想翻也翻不成了。你说对吗？”李文忠没有马上回答，停了好一会，说：“同志们，眼下，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是被咱们揪出来了。咱们取得了很大的胜利。可是，咱们千万不要忘记了毛主席他老人家的教导：‘我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。’同志们，你们说对吗？”革命造反派的战士们心里豁然开朗。“李文忠同志，”一位革命造反派的战士说，“今天晚上你不仅给我们敲了警钟，更重要的是，你用毛泽东思想教育了我们，武装了我们。”李文忠同志说：“咱们要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，时时刻刻用战无不胜的毛泽东思想检查自己。只有这样，咱们才能保证在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上胜利前进！”“对！”革命造反派的战士说：“我们一定牢记毛主席的教导：‘夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。’我们要发扬彻底革命的精神，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批深批透，斗倒斗臭，让他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！”
    东方吐白，红日升起。李文忠和革命造反派的战士们迎着朝阳，迈着更加坚实的步伐，朝前走去。
