The Phu Bai base, located 14 kilometers south of Hue City, is the largest U.S. military base in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region. The U.S. aggressors have established a "strategic" intelligence and technology center there.

A unit of the Liberation Army stationed in Thua Thien Province was assigned the honorable task of attacking the Phu Bai base.

One night, the troops set out in the dark. As soon as the Liberation Army's infantry, artillery, and assault teams entered the positions, they immediately began the tense preparations for the battle.

At 1 a.m., the battle commenced.

The artillery units launched the first assault. Salvo after salvo of artillery fire accurately struck the enemy, while the assault teams, like tigers descending from the mountains, swiftly charged towards the enemy's intelligence and technology center.

The U.S. aggressors were still dreaming. Lights were still on everywhere, and all the targets of attack were clearly visible. The assault teams, according to the predetermined plan, launched fierce attacks. The U.S. aggressors, awakened from their dreams by the bombardment, had just jumped out of bed when they were killed.

At this moment, the Phu Bai base's parking lot, fuel depot, and artillery positions were also under heavy attack.

In an instant, the base was engulfed in flames. The entire airfield was instantly submerged in a sea of fire, with not a single enemy aircraft able to take off and escape. The Liberation Army's shells also hit the enemy's fortifications, killing many enemy soldiers.

The battle was swift and decisive. With the cooperation of the guerrilla forces and local troops, the victorious unit of the Liberation Army safely returned to their base.

In this battle, the entire U.S. intelligence and technology center was annihilated, 50 various enemy aircraft were destroyed, 30 military vehicles were destroyed, and 500 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, the majority of whom were U.S. aggressors.

    奇袭芙拜美军基地
    在顺化市南面十四公里的芙拜基地是美国强盗在广治—承天地区的最大军事基地。美国强盗在这里设立了一个“战略”情报技术中心。
    解放军驻承天省部队某部接受了进攻芙拜基地的光荣任务。
    一天晚上，部队摸黑出发。解放军步兵部队、炮兵部队、突击队一进入阵地，就立刻紧张地展开了战前的准备活动。
    凌晨一时，战斗打响了。
    炮兵部队首先发动攻势。一排排炮火准确地射向敌人，这时，突击队象猛虎出山，迅速冲向敌人情报技术中心。
    美国强盗这时还在做梦呢。到处还亮着明亮的灯光，各个攻击目标看得清清楚楚。各个突击队按照预定计划，发起猛烈进攻。从梦中被轰醒的美国强盗刚从床上跳下来，就被打死。
    这时，芙拜基地的停车场、汽油库、炮兵阵地也遭到猛烈袭击。
    顷刻间，基地一片火海。整个停机坪瞬息间淹没在火海之中，没有一架敌机能够起飞逃脱。解放军的炮弹还击中敌军的工事，炸死许多敌人。
    战斗进行得迅速、利落。在游击队和地方部队的配合作战下，胜利完成任务的解放军某部安全返回根据地。
    在这次战斗中，全歼美国情报技术中心，摧毁各种敌机五十架，军车三十辆。打死打伤敌军五百名，其中大多数是美国强盗。
