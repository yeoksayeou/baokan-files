The Chinese Khrushchev has a piece of "wisdom": "Under socialist conditions, those who wholeheartedly pursue personal interests will not achieve personal interests, but those who wholeheartedly serve the people will have personal interests." It is very clear that the "wholeheartedly serving the people" mentioned by the Chinese Khrushchev is entirely a means to achieve personal interests. It cloaks the pursuit of "personal interests" with the guise of "serving the people," opening a pass for the character "self." If one believes his nonsense and falls into his trap, one will unwittingly sink into the capitalist quagmire and become a "tame tool" for his plot to usurp the party and the state. The Chinese Khrushchev's intentions are indeed evil!

"The wholeheartedly serving the people will have personal interests." This is the absurd logic of revisionism. To pursue "personal interests," one cannot "wholeheartedly serve the people"! To "wholeheartedly serve the people," one cannot mix in any personal interests. Only by being selfless can one be truly public-spirited. We deeply understand that in our socialist country, the character "self" is the target of revolution. Only by eliminating the character "self" can we enter communism. Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the thought revolution of "criticizing the self and opposing revisionism" has achieved great victories. We must carry this revolution through to the end and let the pass for the character "self" opened by the Chinese Khrushchev go to hell!

    不准给“私”字开通行证！
    文书　庄子中
    中国赫鲁晓夫有一段“妙语”：“在社会主义条件下，一心一意搞个人利益的人，是搞不到个人利益的，一心一意为人民服务，反而会有个人利益。”很明白，中国赫鲁晓夫在这里所说的“一心一意为人民服务”，完全是为了达到个人主义目的的一种手段。它给追求“个人利益”披上“为人民服务”的外衣，为“私”字开了通行证。如果听信了他的鬼话，上了他的圈套，最后就会不知不觉地陷进资本主义的泥沼，充当他篡党篡国的“驯服工具”，中国赫鲁晓夫的用心何其毒也！
    “一心一意为人民服务，反而会有个人利益”。这是修正主义的混账逻辑。要追求“个人利益”，就不能“一心一意为人民服务”！要“一心一意为人民服务”，就不能夹杂任何个人主义的私货。大公才能无私，无私才算为公。我们深深懂得，在我们社会主义国家里，“私”字是革命的对象，只有消灭“私”字，才能进入共产主义。在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，“斗私，批修”的思想革命已经取得了伟大胜利。我们一定要把这个革命进行到底，让中国赫鲁晓夫为“私”字开的通行证见鬼去吧！
