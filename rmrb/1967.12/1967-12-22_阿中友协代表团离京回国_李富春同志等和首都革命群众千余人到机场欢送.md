The delegation of the Albanian-Chinese Friendship Association, led by the member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Minister without Portfolio, Comrade Shefqet Peçi, concluded its visit to our country. Carrying with them the deep friendship between the Chinese people and the heroic Albanian people, they departed from Beijing by plane today to return home.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council Li Fuchun, along with relevant responsible officials Wang Shusheng, Qiao Guanhua, and Chutu Nan, as well as over a thousand revolutionary masses from the capital, went to the airport to see them off.

The Albanian Ambassador to China, Natanaili, and embassy staff also came to bid farewell.

Comrade Shefqet Peçi, accompanied by Comrade Li Fuchun, arrived at the airport. As they bid farewell to the welcoming crowd, people held high portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, waving the national flags of both China and Albania, and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live the great friendship and combat unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great leader of the Albanian people and the close comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Before boarding the plane, the Albanian comrades warmly embraced their Chinese comrades. The Chinese comrades tightly held the hands of the Albanian comrades, once again asking the delegation to convey the Chinese people's greetings and affection to Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian people.

After the Albanian comrades boarded the plane, the welcoming crowd continued to wave the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting, "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong."
