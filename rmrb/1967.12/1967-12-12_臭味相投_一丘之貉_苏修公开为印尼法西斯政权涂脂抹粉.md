	Birds of a Feather Flock Together, All Foxes in One Hole
	The Soviet Revisionists Publicly Whitewash the Indonesian Fascist Regime

	BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- YAKARTA, Dec. 12 -- The Soviet revisionist leadership's diplomatic officials in Indonesia have, in recent times, repeatedly colluded with U.S. imperialism to openly whitewash the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and declared their intention to strengthen counterrevolutionary collusion with this fascist regime.

	According to a report by the Jakarta-based "Hope Light Daily," Soviet revisionist Ambassador to Indonesia, Sedyanko, made a public speech in Jakarta on November 7. He completely distorted facts, portraying the regime led by Suharto and Nasution, which is a naked puppet of U.S. imperialism, as a regime "opposing imperialism and colonialism." He further fabricated that the Indonesian fascist regime has adopted a "neutral policy" in its foreign affairs. He also stated that the Soviet revisionist leadership "will strive to develop" cooperation with the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime and praised the counterrevolutionary program passed by the Indonesian "Provisional People's Consultative Assembly" headed by Nasution last year, saying it "can become the basis for further developing" friendly relations and cooperation between the Soviet revisionists and the Indonesian reactionaries.

	In his speech, Sedyanko revealed that the Soviet revisionists are "providing aid" to the Indonesian reactionaries and are "constructing a number of projects" for them.

	It was this same Sedyanko who, at the end of last year, on behalf of the Soviet revisionist leadership, handed over the "Zero Five Five" military project constructed by the Soviet revisionists in Surabaya to the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime's navy for use in suppressing the Indonesian people. In the handover ceremony, he also delivered a speech, boasting about the "close cooperation" between the Soviet revisionists and the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime.

	According to a report by the Antara News Agency, in early April of this year, shortly after Suharto proclaimed himself "acting president," a Soviet revisionist consul general in Indonesia hastily issued a statement in Medan welcoming Suharto's appearance. He said that after Suharto proclaimed himself "acting president," the Soviet revisionists "will strive to further strengthen" relations with the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime.

　　臭味相投　一丘之貉
　　苏修公开为印尼法西斯政权涂脂抹粉
    新华社讯　雅加达消息：苏联修正主义领导集团驻印度尼西亚的外交官员，最近以来一再与美帝国主义相配合，公开为苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权涂脂抹粉，并反复宣称要同这个法西斯政权加强反革命勾结。
    据雅加达《希望之光报》报道，苏修驻印尼大使塞坚科十一月七日在雅加达作了一次公开讲话。他完全颠倒黑白，把以苏哈托、纳苏蒂安为首的这个赤裸裸的美帝国主义的走狗政权，说成为“反对帝国主义和殖民主义”的政权，并且胡说印尼法西斯政权在对外政策方面采取了什么“中立方针”。他还说，苏修领导集团“将努力发展”同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的“合作”，并且称赞以纳苏蒂安为首的印尼“临时人民协商会议”去年通过的反革命纲领，说它“可以成为进一步发展”苏修同印尼反动派之间的“友好关系和合作的基础”。
    塞坚科在这个讲话中透露，苏修“正在援助”印尼反动派，正在为它“兴建一批工程”。
    就是这个塞坚科，在去年年底，代表苏修领导集团，将苏修在泗水兴建的“零五五”号军事工程，交给苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的海军使用，帮助这个法西斯政权镇压印尼人民。他在那个移交仪式上也发表了一篇讲话，大谈苏修和苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权之间的“紧密合作”。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，今年四月初，也就是苏哈托刚刚自封“代理总统”以后，苏修驻印尼的一名总领事连忙在棉兰发表声明，对苏哈托粉墨登场表示欢迎。他说，在苏哈托自封“代理总统”以后，苏修“将致力于进一步密切”与苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的关系。
