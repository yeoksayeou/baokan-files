Establish Grand Ambitions and Walk Our Own Path

I am an ordinary electrician. I only attended school for five years. I would also like to share my views on the education revolution. I believe that a serious problem with the old education system is that it does not follow its own path.

In the factory, I have seen some young technicians who have just graduated from school. The content of the textbooks they carry is mostly foreign. They talk about how things are in this country or that country, but they do not discuss our country's inventions and creations. The Chinese working class has both ambition and talent. In the seventeen years since liberation, we have made numerous inventions and creations in industrial production that have surpassed the world's advanced levels, accumulating a wealth of scientific and technological experience. Take our factory as an example. The quality of a certain type of steel we produce has already surpassed the world's advanced level. The design and equipment for producing this type of steel were all developed by ourselves. This is the fruit of our working class's labor and the crystallization of our wisdom! However, under the serious influence of the revisionist educational line, these experiences were not included in textbooks. No one studied or summarized them, or compiled them into teaching materials to pass on to our next generation. As for those workers with practical experience and advanced thinking, they did not have the qualification to teach in schools. In fact, many workers have real knowledge and experience. If they were to teach, it would be much better than those "experts" who have no practical knowledge and only know how to use foreign dogmas.

Of course, I am not saying that all foreign content in textbooks is bad. What I mean is that when introducing foreign experiences to students, we should combine them with our country's specific conditions; we should serve our socialist construction and uphold righteousness.

Students and teachers of the revolution living in the era of Chairman Mao must establish grand ambitions and lofty aspirations. Under the leadership of our most red and red sun, Chairman Mao, we must eliminate the serious influences of capitalism, revisionism, and feudalism on our educational system, and forge a new path in the education revolution.

　　树立雄心壮志　走自己的路
    我是一个普通电气工人，只读过五年书。对于教育革命我也谈谈自己的看法。我认为过去旧教育制度的一个严重问题，就是不走自己的路。
    在工厂里，我看到一些刚从学校出来的青年技术员，他们所捧的教材内容大部分是洋的。这个国家怎么样，那个国家怎么样，就是不谈我们自己国家的发明和创造。我们中国工人阶级是有志气有才能的，解放十七年来，在工业生产上有不少超过世界先进水平的创造发明，积累了许多科学技术经验。就拿我们厂来说，现在生产的一种钢材，它的质量已经超过了世界先进水平。制造这种钢材，从设计到设备都是自己搞的，这是我们工人阶级劳动的成果，智慧的结晶！但是过去在修正主义教育路线的严重影响下，这些经验是上不了教科书的，谁也不去研究它，总结它，把它编写成教材，传播给我们的下一代。至于那些有实践经验、思想先进的工人，根本没有资格到学校中讲课。其实，工人群众中很多是真正有知识有经验的，让他们讲课，比那些毫无实际知识，只会搬用洋教条的“专家”要强得多。
    当然，我不是说在教材中洋的东西都要不得，而是说在向学生介绍外国的经验时，要与我国的具体情况相结合；要为我们社会主义建设服务，要树立正气。
    生活在毛泽东时代的革命的学生、革命的教员，一定要树雄心，立壮志，在我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席领导下，清除资本主义、修正主义、封建主义对我国教育制度的严重影响，在教育革命中踏出一条崭新的道路来。
