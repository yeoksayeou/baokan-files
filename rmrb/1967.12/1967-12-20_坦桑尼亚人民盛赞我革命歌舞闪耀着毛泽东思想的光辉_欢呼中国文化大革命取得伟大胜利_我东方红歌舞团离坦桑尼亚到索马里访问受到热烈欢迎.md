The Chinese East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe, after successfully completing a 35-day visit and performance in Tanzania, departed from the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam by airplane on the morning of the 18th to head to Somalia.

During their visit to Tanzania, the Chinese East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe performed revolutionary songs and dances that shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought in cities such as Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, Morogoro, Tanga, and Moshi. These performances were warmly received by the audience. Approximately 40,000 Tanzanian spectators watched these performances. Every time the red curtain on stage revealed the golden image of Chairman Mao, the audience burst into enthusiastic applause. Many Tanzanian spectators wished for the long life of the great leader of the Chinese people and the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and they cheered for the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. Some spectators even requested Mao badges from the Chinese performers.

During the troupe's performance in Tanga, a leader of the Tanga Youth League of the Tanganyika African National Union told the Chinese performers, "We are very happy to see from your performance that the Chinese people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved great victories in the proletarian cultural revolution." He also said that the performance showed people that the Chinese people resolutely support the struggle of all peoples of the world against imperialism and colonialism. Another spectator said he particularly liked the songs and dances that praised the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and embodied the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

During their visit and performance in Moshi, Chinese cultural workers held a get-together with the residents of Moshi. At this get-together, a school band in Moshi performed the songs "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" and "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" to praise the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great Chinese People's Liberation Army founded by Chairman Mao.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, the 18th, the Chinese East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe, led by Director Xu Ping, arrived in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, by special plane in the afternoon of the 18th. They were invited by the Somali government to perform here. Those who warmly welcomed the East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe at the airport included: Mohamed Hashi, Director of the Somali National Theater, Musa Gule, Director of the Planning Department of the Ministry of Information, Jama Haraf, Manager of the National Theater, Suleiman Dahir, Director of the National Broadcasting Corporation, Abdurahman Faji Elmi, Director of Mogadishu Radio, and many Somali artists.

The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Somalia, Zheng Peitang, also went to the airport to welcome them.

At the airport, many Somali artists dressed in festive attire, wearing shining Mao badges on their chests, and holding national musical instruments, enthusiastically welcomed the Chinese friends. When the members of the Chinese song and dance troupe stepped off the plane, the hosts and guests waved the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" with deep emotions. Then, the Somali musicians played "The East Is Red," and the artists of both countries sang together in unison, expressing their boundless admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. The hosts and guests repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Somalia!"
