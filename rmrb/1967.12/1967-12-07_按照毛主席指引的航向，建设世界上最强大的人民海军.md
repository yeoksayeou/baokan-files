The closest comrade-in-arms of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, Comrade Lin Biao, inscribed the words "Navigating the vast seas relies on the helmsman; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" for the first naval cadre conference to study the works of Chairman Mao. This is the fundamental principle for the construction of our navy, the political direction that our navy will always follow, and also the political direction that all the people of China and the world will always follow.

I have worked in the torpedo boat unit of the navy for over a decade. I deeply feel that every step forward we take is due to the guidance of our great commander Chairman Mao; every victory we achieve is a victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our military construction. To study Mao Zedong Thought, we must combine learning with application, and see immediate results. Only by steadfastly advancing along the red path opened by our great helmsman Chairman Mao can we build a navy that is the strongest in the world.

To thoroughly repudiate the bourgeois military line that prioritizes technology and to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's military line

Even before the founding of the People's Republic of China, our great leader Chairman Mao solemnly declared to the world: "We will not only have a powerful army but also a powerful air force and a powerful navy." On February 21, 1953, Chairman Mao personally inspected the navy and issued a battle cry to the people of the entire nation and all the soldiers and officers of the army: "To counter imperialist aggression, we must definitely build a powerful navy."

Chairman Mao's great call embodies the ardent hopes of the Chinese people and the people of the world. We deeply understand that the navy Chairman Mao instructs us to build is a navy that carries out revolutionary political tasks and is the first in the world. It is a navy capable of annihilating imperialism. This naval force can only be a new type of people's navy completely built according to Chairman Mao's military thought. Our torpedo boat unit is precisely advancing victoriously along Chairman Mao's military line as instructed by our great commander Chairman Mao.

"History tells us that the correct political and military lines are not produced and developed naturally and peacefully." The history of the growth and strengthening of our torpedo boat unit is a history of the continuous struggle of Chairman Mao's military line against the bourgeois military line. From the moment our torpedo boat unit was born, it has been engaged in a sharp and intense struggle over the core issue of whether to prioritize military matters or political matters, and whether to follow the path of emphasizing technology or emphasizing politics.

Initially, we who were transferred from the army to participate in the construction of the torpedo boat unit had low cultural levels due to our long-term oppression and lack of education. Now, we had to master such complex technical equipment as torpedo boats, and the difficulties were numerous. At this time, Liu Shaoqi and his agent Peng Dehuai took the opportunity to openly raise the black flag of bourgeois technology-first and fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian military line. They loudly proclaimed that the navy's technical equipment is complex, that the army fights bravely, and that the navy fights with technology. They should first learn technology well. They shouted hysterically: In the torpedo boat unit with complex technical equipment, Chairman Mao's thought of political construction of the military "is no longer applicable," and only the path of technological construction of the military can be followed. They used every means to weaken the political work system personally formulated by Chairman Mao for our army, and even once abolished the political instructors of the torpedo boat squadrons.

How should we build the navy? We studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. In his brilliant works such as "Struggles in Chingkangshan" and "Rectify the Party's Erroneous Ideas," Chairman Mao pointed out the direction for us. Chairman Mao taught us: "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary political task force." "Without correct political views, it is as if there is no soul." Chairman Mao's teachings and the glorious traditions of our army made us understand that no matter how modern warfare develops and how technical equipment changes, the fundamental principle of emphasizing political construction of the people's army must not change in the slightest. We can only forever build the people's navy according to Mao Zedong Thought. This is the fundamental guarantee that the people's army will never change color. This is the fundamental guarantee of our victory.

Political construction of the military means building the military with Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing politics, and deeply implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian military line in all aspects of military construction. Vice Chairman Lin instructed us: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." This is the fundamental direction that we must follow in political construction of the military. Since Vice Chairman Lin took charge of the Military Commission, especially since 1963, we have followed Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's military line. However, Luo Ruiqing crazily promoted the bourgeois military line of military-first and technology-first, and we engaged in a head-on struggle with him. In the troops, we deeply carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. New comrades, as soon as they boarded the boat, were not given guns or cannons, but Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles." The first lesson on board was no longer "the performance of the torpedo boat," but "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In peacetime, we required the soldiers to consciously use the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a weapon to carry out the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideas and promote proletarian ideas; in wartime, we required the soldiers to consciously bring the glorious images of Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Mountain to fight bravely. A large number of facts have proven that the better a soldier studies Chairman Mao's works, the more thoroughly he eliminates selfishness and establishes public spirit, the braver and smarter he is, the more "complete" and "thorough" he is in serving the people, and the better he can withstand various severe tests. Our 145th boat is an advanced collective in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In a naval battle, two U.S.-made Kuomintang ships, relying on the protection of their American masters' warships, used all their firepower to attack our 145th boat as soon as they met. The soldiers completely ignored the threat of enemy fire and rushed towards the enemy ships like tigers, occupying a favorable attack position. However, just as they were about to carry out the attack, the cunning enemy desperately changed course, and the incoming shells became even more fierce. At this moment, the soldiers did not think of their personal safety, but of Chairman Mao's teachings that every word and every action must be responsible to the people. They said: "The country's people gave us the torpedoes to annihilate the enemy, and we will not easily release them; if we fail once, we will enter again, even if we have to enter and exit ten times, we will not release the torpedo without absolute certainty." They decisively turned to the left and bravely rushed towards the enemy ship again.

The 145th boat fought bravely under the enemy's fierce fire for nearly twenty minutes and finally, with the cooperation of the brother units, sank the enemy ship. These twenty minutes were a white-hot battle on the sea, a bayonet charge, the toughest twenty minutes. This toughness was not achieved through technology, but through politics, through Mao Zedong Thought in the soldiers' minds. Our torpedo boat unit, in the struggle to defend the country's thousand-mile coast and defend the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, has repeatedly proven in countless vivid facts that the role of people and politics plays a decisive role. In naval construction, new-type ships are the "cutting edge" of scientific and technological development, but they can never compare to the role and brave spirit of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the true iron wall on the sea, which no weapon can destroy, and are the true "cutting edge" that decides the victory of naval battles. With such people, we can defeat all enemies. To sweep away all harmful elements, we have no enemies!

To thoroughly repudiate the theories of "weapons are all-powerful," "regulations are all-powerful," and "experts are all-powerful," and to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought

We followed Chairman Mao's military line in the construction of the torpedo boat unit and encountered many difficulties and obstacles. Liu Shaoqi and his agent Peng Dehuai, in order to seize the military and restore capitalism, loudly advocated following the path of imperialist and Soviet revisionist naval construction, vigorously peddling bourgeois and revisionist so-called "experience" in building the navy. They brought in a set of "foreign doctrines" and "foreign models" for the operation and training of torpedo boat units, demanding that we "learn them without distortion." They said that in torpedo boat warfare, it all depends on these two books. They desperately advocated "weapons are all-powerful," "regulations are all-powerful," and "experts are all-powerful." They said that naval warfare depends on the tonnage of ships, the caliber of cannons, and the slide rule. In their eyes, only "regulations," "models," and so-called "experts" are the "highest authorities" that decide the victory or defeat of naval battles, while the broad masses of soldiers have become tools for them to manipulate. Using their set of rules to train the troops, using the predetermined dead frameworks in their "code" to deal with the ever-changing battlefield situation, can only gradually make our army politically degenerate, and as proven in some naval battles, it is "living people fighting dead battles" and can only "watch but not fight."

At that time, we saw these strange things and our minds were in turmoil. We used Chairman Mao's teachings to analyze and criticize them. We resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings and walked our own path. It was at this time that I participated in the battle to raid the U.S.-made Kuomintang "Dongting" gunboat.

At that time, there were five to six-level winds and waves on the sea, and we were a single boat with only one torpedo left. In such a situation, according to the regulations of the Soviet revisionists, not to mention fighting, even sailing was absolutely not allowed. However, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, took the mass line, mobilized the masses to think and find ways. After setting sail, due to the lack of torpedoes on the right pipe, the boat was very unbalanced in the waves, so we followed the opinions of everyone and asked a few people to stand on the right side. The speed was difficult to control, so the power was "delegated" to the engine room chief to automatically adjust according to the waves. We relied on Mao Zedong Thought and the collective wisdom to overcome this special situation of "unable to sail" and "unable to fight."

The torpedo boat continued to advance, and the enemy ship "Dongting" was finally discovered. According to the regulations of the revisionists, to deal with this type of gunboat, at least four torpedo boats and eight torpedoes were needed. But we were a single boat with only one torpedo! However, we remembered Chairman Mao's teachings with deep hatred for the enemy: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and painful the situation is, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight." Single boat, we would rush even closer; single torpedo, we would not release it without absolute certainty. We finally used this single torpedo to sink the enemy ship. The soldiers, in the joy of victory, shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

"Navigating the vast seas relies on the helmsman; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." This naval battle is a miracle in the history of world naval warfare; this naval battle is a battle to thoroughly repudiate the bourgeois and revisionist theories of "weapons are all-powerful," "regulations are all-powerful," and "experts are all-powerful," and a battle to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. The victory of this naval battle made us see more clearly: the so-called "all-powerful" that the bourgeois and revisionists have hyped up are just junk from the military arsenals of bourgeois armies. Today, in the world, the only true "all-powerful" is the great Mao Zedong Thought. We have mastered Mao Zedong Thought and can forever stand unshakable.

These iron-clad facts made us break away from the superstition of bourgeois and revisionist foreign regulations and tactics. No matter what "regulations" and "tactics" the Soviet revisionists have, as long as they go against Chairman Mao's teachings, we will smash them to pieces. The bourgeois and revisionists say that "torpedo boats cannot fight close combat," so we, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, organized the troops to extensively practice close combat. After hundreds of repeated actual battles, we shattered their fallacies. Once, our six boats received the task of fighting thirteen enemy ships. In the pre-battle mobilization, we emphasized bravery and fearlessness of death, fighting close combat, and stipulated that we must approach within × chains to release the torpedo. We did this and encountered strong opposition from some so-called "technical authorities." They said: "The launching distance of the torpedo is scientifically calculated and cannot be approached. What you are doing is against science."

They even quoted the "classics" to question me: "Is it the regulations that count, or is it what Zhang Yimin says that counts?" I replied without hesitation: "Our troops are commanded by the great leader Chairman Mao, and my command authority is given by Chairman Mao. I can only command according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Only Chairman Mao's words count!"

In this battle, although the enemy's strength was overwhelming, we completely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, fighting politically, fighting the bravery of people, fighting close combat, and achieved a major victory of sinking and damaging one enemy ship each.

Since 1963, under the personal care and repeated instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, and through the resolute struggle of the revolutionary leading cadres of the navy, we have thoroughly smashed the capitalist and revisionist foreign regulations and frameworks and gradually established our own regulations and models that conform to Mao Zedong Thought. The construction of the navy has taken on a new look. Our torpedo boat unit resolutely takes Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, seriously understands the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works summarized by Vice Chairman Lin, strives to learn Mao Zedong Thought, and builds the torpedo boat unit according to Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

To firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in naval warfare and vow to write a new chapter of Mao Zedong Thought in the history of world naval warfare

"Revolutionary warfare is the people's warfare. Only by mobilizing the people can we wage warfare, and only by relying on the people can we wage warfare." Our great commander Chairman Mao led the people of our country in long-term revolutionary warfare practice and created a complete set of the most scientific, most complete, and highest-level strategies and tactics of people's warfare. To build a powerful people's navy, we must apply Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thoughts of people's warfare to the construction of the navy.

However, Liu Shaoqi and his agent Peng Dehuai have long advocated the slogan of "the navy is special," shouting hysterically: "There are no forests, gullies, or green cornfields on the sea, no people, and the tactics of people's warfare are outdated."

The first to smash this reactionary fallacy was our brother escort boat unit.

This was the first heroic unit to appear on our country's seas. It was they who, in the pitch-black night, ambushed near the reefs, suddenly attacked the enemy's large warships, and made the enemy's ships howl and flee like ghosts and rats; it was they who, under the cover of dark night and thick fog, raided the enemy's harbors, and fought so fiercely that the enemy ships howled and fled like ghosts and rats; it was they who cleverly approached the enemy, suddenly boarded, and captured the enemy ships with hand grenades and explosive packages, forcing the enemy to surrender en masse. In our torpedo boat unit's actual naval battles, it was also fully proven that only people's warfare is the best and only way to defeat the enemy on the sea. As long as we master Mao Zedong Thought, rely closely on the masses of the people, and make full use of the "green cornfields" on the sea: the reefs and islands on the sea, the clouds and fog in the sky, and the waves in the sea, and fully apply the strategies and tactics of people's warfare, we will definitely bury imperialism and its running dogs.

At one time, the Kuomintang remnants holed up in Taiwan, in order to cooperate with their American masters in implementing the counter-revolutionary global strategy, intensified their harassment of our southeastern coastal fishing grounds. One night, we received the order to go to a certain place to wait in ambush for the enemy ships. From the base to the waiting point, we had to pass through a narrow channel less than two nautical miles from the enemy-occupied island. How could we safely navigate the torpedo boats to the waiting point? It was the fishermen brothers who thought of a good way to cover the torpedo boats through the enemy-occupied sea area. When we arrived at the waiting point, the fishermen brothers also let the torpedo boats anchor tightly next to their fishing boats and dispatched patrol boats to patrol and reconnoiter for us. Later, the enemy ship was suddenly attacked by us, hit by a torpedo, and before it could figure out what was happening, it concentrated its firepower, desperately firing at the sky, and shouted to Taiwan: "There are communist bombers all over my ship..."

Chairman Mao's great thought of people's warfare is a universal truth that applies to all seas. With the development of warfare, the means of combat and geographical environment are ever-changing, but the fundamental guiding principles of Chairman Mao's people's warfare are forever applicable. With these fundamental guiding principles, we can have people's warfare under the conditions of small rice and rifles, and we can create people's warfare under the conditions of modern conventional weapons and atomic bombs; we can have people's warfare on land, and we can create people's warfare on the sea. Vice Chairman Lin's creative application of Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's warfare to propose a series of combat principles is also a universal truth. We must study and apply them actively. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide naval warfare and closely combine the universal truth of Chairman Mao's people's warfare thought with the actual situation of naval warfare. In recent years, we have learned a little and applied it a little, starting from the actual situation, gradually applying the tactical principles proposed by Vice Chairman Lin in his active study and application of Chairman Mao's military thoughts, such as "one point two sides," "three-thirds system," "four groups one team," and "three fierce tactics," flexibly to the sea. Our specific methods, although different from and changed from those of the army, have proven in practice that as long as we start from the actual situation and implement these principles, naval command will have unlimited vitality and we will definitely win battles. Once, we received the task of a long-distance raid on enemy ships. In this naval battle, we completely abandoned the "foreign tactics" and resolutely fought according to Chairman Mao's combat thoughts and Vice Chairman Lin's tactical principles, implementing "one point two sides," encircling and surrounding, the torpedo boat team rushed up, approached the enemy ship, and no matter how desperately the enemy ship tried to intercept, we did not release the torpedo without occupying a good firing position and having absolute certainty of hitting the enemy ship. We circled around the enemy ship for more than forty minutes, making twelve entries and exits. This was an unprecedented thrilling scene in the history of torpedo boat warfare, frightening the enemy ship captain to howl to Taiwan: "There are communist fast boats all around my ship within a thousand yards, the situation is extremely urgent!" We had not yet released the torpedo, and the bandits were already so frightened that they jumped into the sea to escape. The victory of this naval battle fully proved the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in naval warfare. It made me even more firmly believe that Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics of people's warfare are the best and only weapons for us to wage revolutionary warfare, sufficient for us to annihilate all imperialists.

To use Mao Zedong Thought well in naval warfare, we must combine it with the actual situation and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, constantly using Mao Zedong Thought as a guide to summarize experience and lessons. Our torpedo boat unit has participated in nine battles, and with the cooperation of brother units, we have sunk five enemy ships and seriously damaged one. I have participated in six battles, sinking three enemy ships and seriously damaging one. Numerous naval battles have proven that whether a battle is fought well or not depends first on whether our ideological awareness is high and whether Chairman Mao's thought of people's warfare is used well. Experience and lessons are countless, but first, we must find the experience and lessons of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. We must make the process of summarizing naval battle experience a process of eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, a process of transforming worldviews, a process of constantly establishing Mao Zedong Thought, and a process of firmly establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's thought of people's warfare.

"The seas are in turmoil, the clouds are angry, the winds are roaring, the continents are shaking."

The world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner!

Under the call and inspiration of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary flames of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world are burning fiercely, and the situation is like a prairie fire.

The People's Republic of China led by the great leader Chairman Mao has become an extremely strong base for world revolution.

We must build a powerful navy that matches the world revolutionary base! As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to command our navy, and especially now, seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, carry out the revolutionization of ideology, and apply Mao Zedong Thought to all work, we will definitely build a powerful navy and definitely build a navy that can annihilate imperialism for the people of the world. "A thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment." We will devote our lifetime to accelerate the construction of a powerful people's navy. As long as imperialism dares to launch a war, we will resolutely, thoroughly, and cleanly annihilate it! The era of imperialism ruling the world's oceans must end in our hands. We will definitely fight for a new world where Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly and is red all over!

### 按照毛主席指引的航向，建设世界上最强大的人民海军

    按照毛主席指引的航向，建设世界上最强大的人民海军
    海军学习毛主席著作积极分子、海军某鱼雷艇部队政治委员　张逸民
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，给海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会题词：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，是我们海军建设的根本，是我们海军永远遵循的政治方向，也是全国人民、全世界人民永远遵循的政治方向。
    我在海军鱼雷艇部队工作十几年。我深深体会到，我们每向前迈开一步，都是由于伟大统帅毛主席的指引；取得的每一个胜利，都是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。毛泽东思想是我军建设的灵魂。学习毛泽东思想，必须学用结合，立竿见影。只有坚定不移地沿着伟大舵手毛主席开辟的红色航道奋勇前进，才能建设一支世界上最强大的人民解放军海军。
    大破技术第一的资产阶级建军路线，大树特树毛主席建军路线的绝对权威
    早在中华人民共和国成立的前夕，我们伟大领袖毛主席就向全世界庄严宣告：“我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和一个强大的海军。”一九五三年二月二十一日，毛主席亲临海军视察，又向全国人民、全军指战员发出了战斗号召：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”
    毛主席的伟大号召，表达了中国人民和世界人民的殷切期望。我们深深懂得：毛主席指示我们要建立的海军，是建立世界上第一支执行革命政治任务的人民海军，是建立一支足以消灭帝国主义的海军。这支海军部队只能是完完全全按照毛主席建军思想建立起来的新型的人民海军。我们这支鱼雷艇部队，正是遵照伟大统帅毛主席的教导，沿着毛主席的军事路线胜利前进的。
    “历史告诉我们，正确的政治的和军事的路线，不是自然地平安地产生和发展起来的”。我们这支鱼雷艇部队成长、壮大的历史，就是毛主席的建军路线不断地战胜资产阶级建军路线的斗争史。我们这支鱼雷艇部队一诞生，就围绕着是军事第一还是政治第一，走突出技术的路还是走突出政治的路这个两条军事路线的核心问题，开展了尖锐、激烈的斗争。
    最初，我们这些从陆军调来的参加鱼雷艇部队建设的人，由于从小受压迫，念不起书，文化水平都比较低，现在要去掌握鱼雷艇这样复杂的技术装备，困难是很多的。就在这个时候，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人彭德怀，乘机公开打起资产阶级的技术第一的黑旗，拚命反对毛主席的无产阶级建军路线。他们大肆叫嚣什么海军技术装备复杂，陆军打仗靠勇敢，海军打仗靠技术，你们应该首先学好技术。他们声嘶力竭地叫嚷：在技术装备复杂的鱼雷艇部队，毛主席政治建军的思想“不适用了”，只有走技术建军的道路。他们千方百计地削弱毛主席亲手为我军制订的政治工作制度，甚至一度把鱼雷艇中队的政治指导员也取消了。
    到底怎么样建设海军，我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席在《井冈山的斗争》和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作中，给我们指明了前进的方向。毛主席教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”毛主席的教导，我军的光荣传统，使我们懂得了：无论现代战争怎样发展，技术装备怎样千变万化，人民军队着重从政治上建军这个根本，一丝一毫不能变。我们只能永远按照毛泽东思想建设人民海军。这是人民军队永不变色的根本保证。这是我们取得胜利的根本保证。
    政治建军，就是用毛泽东思想建军，就是走突出政治的路，把毛主席的无产阶级军事路线深入地贯彻到部队建设的各个领域里去。林副主席指示我们：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”这是我们政治建军必须遵循的根本方向。自从林副主席主持军委工作后，特别是一九六三年以来，我们遵照林副主席的指示，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行了毛主席的建军路线，可是罗瑞卿却疯狂地推行军事第一、技术第一的资产阶级军事路线，我们和他展开了针锋相对的斗争，在部队中深入地开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。新同志一上艇，首先交给他们的不是枪、不是炮，而是毛主席的“老三篇”。上艇的第一课不再是“鱼雷艇的性能”，而是《为人民服务》。平时，要求战士们自觉地以“老三篇”为武器，开展灭资兴无的斗争；战时，要求战士们自觉地带着张思德、白求恩和老愚公的光辉形象去英勇战斗。大量事实证明：哪个战士毛主席著作学得最好，“私”字破得最彻底，“公”字立得最牢固，哪个战士就最勇敢，最聪明，为人民服务就最“完全”最“彻底”，就能经受住各种最严峻的考验。我们的一四五艇是个活学活用毛主席著作的先进集体，在一次海战中，两条美制蒋舰依仗着美国主子的军舰的“保镖”，同我们的鱼雷艇一碰面，就使用了全部火力向我们一四五艇轰击。战士们根本不顾敌人炮火的威胁，猛虎般地直向敌舰冲去，强占住有利的攻击阵位。可是，就在准备实施攻击的一瞬间，狡猾的敌人拚着命地连续改变航向，打过来的炮弹更加猛烈了。此刻，战士们想到的不是个人的安危，而是毛主席关于每句话、每个行动都要对人民负责的教导，他们说：“祖国人民把鱼雷交给我们，是要我们去消灭敌人，决不轻易放出去；一次不成，再进入一次，哪怕打个十进十出，没有十二分把握，决不放雷。”他们果断地打了一个左舵，又勇敢地向敌舰扑去。
    一四五艇在敌人猛烈的炮火下奋战了近二十分钟，最后终于在兄弟部队协同配合下击沉了敌舰。这二十分钟，就是海上的白刃战，拚刺刀，最过硬的二十分钟。这个过硬，不是靠的技术，而是靠的政治，靠战士头脑中的毛泽东思想。我们这支鱼雷艇部队在保卫祖国的千里海疆、保卫毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命的对敌斗争中，无数生动事实一再证明：人的作用，政治的作用，起着决定的作用。在海军建设中，新型舰船，是科学技术发展的“尖端”，但它永远也比不上用毛泽东思想武装起来的人的作用和勇敢精神。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是真正的海上的钢铁长城，是什么武器也摧不垮的，是决定海战胜利的真正“尖端”。有了这样的人，就能战胜一切敌人。要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌！
    大破“武器万能”、“条令万能”和“专家万能”论，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威
    我们按照毛主席的建军路线，在建设鱼雷艇部队中，碰到了许多困难，遇到了种种阻力。中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人彭德怀之流，出于篡军反党、复辟资本主义的需要，大肆鼓吹走帝国主义、苏修建设海军的道路，大力兜售资产阶级的和修正主义的所谓建设“经验”，搬来了一套套鱼雷艇部队作战和训练的“洋教条”、“洋教范”，要我们“不走样的学”，胡说什么“鱼雷艇打仗，靠的就是这两本书”。他们拚命地宣扬“武器万能”、“条令万能”、“专家万能”。他们说，海军打仗靠的是舰船的吨位、火炮的口径和计算尺。在他们眼里，只有“条令”“教范”和所谓“专家”，才是决定海战胜负的“最高权威”，而广大的士兵群众却成了任凭他们摆布的“工具”。用他们那一套去训练部队，用他们的“法典”上预先规定好的死框框，去套千变万化的战场形势，只能是逐渐使我们的军队政治上变质，只能是象一些海战中所证明的那样，是“活人打死仗”，“只能看，不能战”。
    当时，我们看到这些奇奇怪怪的事，脑海里在翻腾着。我们用毛主席的教导去分析它，批判它。我们坚决地按照毛主席的教导，走自己的路。就在这时候，我参加了奇袭美制蒋帮“洞庭号”炮舰的战斗。
    当时，海上有五至六级风浪，我们又是单艇，艇上只剩下一条雷，在这样的情况下，按照苏修条令的规定，不用说打仗，就连出海也是绝对不允许的。但是，我们按照毛主席的教导，走群众路线，发动群众开动脑筋想办法。出航后，由于右管无雷，在风浪中高速航行，艇很不平衡，就根据大家意见，叫几个人站到右舷去，航速难掌握，就把权力“下放”给轮机长，由他根据风浪自动调整。我们硬是靠毛泽东思想，靠集体的智慧，战胜了这个“不能航行”“不能作战”的特殊情况。
    鱼雷艇继续向前航行，敌舰“洞庭号”终于被我们发现了。按照修正主义的条令规定，对付这种类型号的炮舰，至少要有四艘鱼雷艇八颗鱼雷。而我们是单艇独雷啊！但是我们怀着对敌人无比的仇恨，牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”单艇，我们就冲得更近些；独雷，没有绝对把握就坚决不放雷。我们终于用这颗独雷，击沉了敌舰。战士们在胜利的喜悦中，连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。这次海战，是世界海军战争史上的奇迹；这次海战，是一次大破资产阶级和修正主义的“武器万能”、“条令万能”、“专家万能”论的海战，是一次大树特树毛泽东思想绝对权威的海战。这次海战的胜利使我们更加看清了：被资产阶级和修正主义者吹上了天的这个“万能”，那个“万能”，都只不过是从资产阶级军队的军库中搬出来的破烂货。今天，在世界上唯一真正的万能，就是伟大的毛泽东思想。我们掌握了毛泽东思想，就能永远立于不败之地。
    这些铁的事实，使我们破除了对资产阶级和修正主义的洋条条、洋战法的迷信。管他什么苏修的“条令”、“教范”，只要违背毛主席的教导，我们就砸它个稀巴烂。资产阶级和修正主义者说什么“鱼雷艇不能打近战”，我们就根据毛主席的教导，组织部队大练近战。经过上百次的反复实战，粉碎了他们那一套谬论。有一次，我们六艘艇，接受了打十三艘敌舰的作战任务。在战前动员中，我们强调了要勇敢不怕死，要打近战，并且规定，一定要逼近到×链以内放雷。我们这样作，遭到了一些所谓“技术权威”的强烈反对。他们说：“鱼雷的发射距离，是经过科学计算的，不能靠近的，你们这样做是违反科学的。”
    他们甚至搬出“经典”来责问我：“是条令规定的算数，还是张逸民说的算数？”我毫不含糊地回答：“我们的部队是伟大领袖毛主席统帅的，我的指挥权是毛主席给的，我只有按照毛主席的教导去指挥，毛主席的话就是最高的权威。只有毛主席说的才算数！”
    这次战斗，尽管敌我力量悬殊，由于我们完全按照毛主席的教导，打政治，打人的勇敢，打近战，取得了击沉击伤敌舰各一艘的重大胜利。
    一九六三年以来，在林副主席的亲自关怀和一再教导下，经过海军革命领导干部的坚决斗争，彻底摧垮了资本主义的、修正主义的洋条条、洋框框，逐步建立了自己的符合毛泽东思想的条令、教范。海军建设出现了崭新的面貌。我鱼雷艇部队坚决以林副主席为光辉榜样，认真领会林副主席总结的活学活用毛主席著作的经验，努力学习毛泽东思想，按照毛泽东思想建设鱼雷艇部队，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    大树特树毛泽东思想在海战中的绝对权威，誓在世界海军史上写下毛泽东思想的新篇章
    “革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”我们的伟大统帅毛主席，领导我国人民在长期的革命战争的实践中，创造了一整套最科学、最完整、最高水平的人民战争的战略战术。要建立强大的人民海军，就必须把毛主席的人民战争的战略战术思想，运用到海军建设中来。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人彭德怀之流，长期以来，打起“海军特殊”的破旗，声嘶力竭地嚎叫：“海上没有森林，没有山沟，没有青纱帐，没有群众，人民战争那一套，过时了。”
    首先粉碎这个反动谬论的，是我们的兄弟护卫艇部队。
    这是第一个出现在祖国海洋上的英雄部队。是他们，在漆黑的深夜里，埋伏在礁石旁，神出鬼没地痛击敌人的大兵舰；是他们，趁着暗夜浓雾，奇袭敌人的港湾，打得敌舰鬼嚎鼠窜；是他们，巧妙地逼近敌人，突然跳帮，用手榴弹、炸药包捕获敌舰艇，逼着敌人集体投降。在我们鱼雷艇部队的海战实战中，也完全说明了，海上也只有靠人民战争才是克敌制胜最好最好的法宝。只要我们掌握了毛泽东思想，紧紧依靠人民群众，充分利用海上的“青纱帐”：海上的礁石、岛屿，天空的白云、浓雾，海里的浪花，充分发挥人民战争的战略战术，一定能够埋葬帝国主义及其走狗。
    有一个时候，盘踞在台湾的国民党残匪，为配合他们的美国主子推行反革命全球战略的需要，加紧了对我东南沿海渔场的骚扰。一天夜里，我们接到去某地待机伏击敌舰的战斗命令。由基地到待机点，必须通过距敌占岛屿不到两浬的一条狭长的航道。怎样才能使鱼雷艇安全航渡到待机点呢？还是渔民兄弟给我们想出了好办法，掩护鱼雷艇通过了敌占海区。到了待机点，渔民兄弟又让鱼雷艇紧紧地靠着他们的渔船抛了锚，并派出警戒船为我们巡逻、侦察。后来，敌舰遭我突然袭击，挨了鱼雷，还没弄清是怎么回事，就一面集中火力，拚命往天上打炮，一面大叫大嚷地向台湾报告：“我舰上空全是共军的轰炸机……”
    毛主席的伟大的人民战争思想是放之四海皆准的普遍真理。随着战争的发展，作战的手段、地理环境是万变的，但是毛主席的人民战争的根本指导原则，却是永远适用的。有了这些根本的指导原则，我们就可以既有小米加步枪条件下的人民战争，又能创造出现代化常规武器加原子弹条件下的人民战争；既有陆上的人民战争，又能创造出海洋上的人民战争。林副主席创造性地运用毛主席人民战争的思想提出的一系列作战原则，同样是普遍真理。我们一定要活学活用，要用毛泽东思想指导海战，把毛主席人民战争思想的普遍真理同海战实际紧密结合起来。几年来，我们学一点就用一点，从实际出发，逐步把林副主席活学活用毛主席的军事思想提出的“一点两面”“三三制”“四组一队”“三猛战术”等战术原则，灵活地运用到海上来。我们的具体做法虽然和陆军的做法有所不同，有所改变，但实践证明，只要从实际出发贯彻了这些原则，海战指挥就有了无限的生命力，就一定能打胜仗。有一次，我们接受了长途奇袭敌舰的战斗任务。这次海战，我们完全抛弃了“洋打法”，坚决按照毛主席的作战思想和林副主席的战术原则打仗，实行“一点两面”，迂回包围，鱼雷艇队冲上去，逼近敌舰，任凭敌舰如何疯狂拦击，我们没占好射击阵位，没有击中敌舰的绝对把握，就是不放雷。我们咬住敌舰周旋了四十多分钟，杀了十二个进出。这是世界鱼雷艇作战史中从来没有的惊心动魄的场面，吓得敌舰长向台湾嚎叫：“我舰一千码内都是共军快艇，情况非常紧急！”我们还没有放雷，匪军就吓得纷纷跳海逃命。这次海战的胜利，充分证明了毛泽东思想在海战中的绝对权威。使我更加坚信，毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术，是我们进行革命战争的最好最好的法宝，足够我们消灭一切帝国主义用的了。
    要在海战中把毛泽东思想用好，就要结合实际活学活用毛主席著作，不断地以毛泽东思想为指针，总结经验教训。我所在的鱼雷艇部队共作战九次，在兄弟部队协同配合下，击沉敌舰五艘，重伤一艘。我参加作战六次，击沉敌舰三艘，重伤一艘。多次海战实践证明，仗打得好不好，首先看我们的思想觉悟高不高，看毛主席的人民战争思想用得好不好。经验教训千条万条，首先要找学习和运用毛泽东思想的经验教训。使总结海战经验的过程，成为破私立公的过程，成为改造世界观的过程，成为不断大立毛泽东思想的过程，成为大树特树毛主席的人民战争思想的绝对权威的过程。
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”
    世界已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代！
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的号召和鼓舞下，全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命烈火熊熊燃烧，势成燎原。
    由伟大领袖毛主席领导的中华人民共和国，已经成为世界革命无比坚强的根据地。
    我们一定要建立同世界革命根据地相称的强大海军！只要我们高高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想统帅我们的海军，当前特别要认真学习毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，搞好思想革命化，把毛泽东思想运用到各项工作中去，我们就一定能建立一支强大的海军，就一定能够建立一支足够消灭帝国主义的世界人民的海军。“一万年太久，只争朝夕。”我们将用毕生的精力，加快强大的人民海军的建设。只要帝国主义敢于发动战争，我们就坚决、彻底、干净地把它消灭掉！帝国主义在世界各大洋上称王称霸的时代，一定要在我们手里结束。我们一定能打出一个毛泽东思想阳光普照的红彤彤的新世界！　（新华社六日讯）
