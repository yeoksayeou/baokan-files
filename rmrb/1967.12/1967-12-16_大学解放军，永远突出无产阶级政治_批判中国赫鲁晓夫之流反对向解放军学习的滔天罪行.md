The four firsts are good; this is a creation. The PLA’s ideological and political work and military work, after Comrade Lin Biao proposed the four firsts and the three-eight style, have developed significantly compared to the past, becoming more concrete and theoretical.

	Mao Zedong

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is our great leader Chairman Mao's personally created and led, and Vice Chairman Lin's directly commanded, unparalleled people's army. It is the strongest pillar of our country's proletarian dictatorship. At any time and under any circumstances, it is absolutely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, setting a brilliant example for the entire nation.

Four years ago, when the struggle between the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, became sharply intensified under new circumstances, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "learn from the PLA." Chairman Mao also instructed all industrial departments of the state, from top to bottom (from the department to the factory and mine), to learn from the PLA, to establish political departments, political sections, and political instructors, and to implement the four firsts and the three-eight style. This is a call of profound significance, a great strategic measure to prevent and counter revisionism. As long as the people of the entire nation learn from the PLA, and like the PLA, never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, always emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, then the evil plot of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party to restore capitalism in our country will never succeed, and our proletarian dictatorship state will never change color.

Chairman Mao's great call reflects the strong desire of the people of the entire nation and is the greatest care, encouragement, inspiration, and spur for the millions of workers on the industrial and transportation front. The broad masses of workers actively responded to Chairman Mao's call and quickly launched a mass movement to learn from the PLA, advancing boldly on the path of revolutionization.

Chairman Mao's great call is a mobilization order to launch a new counterattack on all fronts occupied by the bourgeoisie. It is like a clap of thunder, shaking the earth, and all the ghosts and demons at home and abroad are terrified. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, with their counter-revolutionary class sensitivity, realized that if the people of the entire nation learn from the PLA and carry out revolutionization, their counter-revolutionary revisionist line would be even more difficult to implement, their evil plot to restore capitalism would be even harder to realize, and all the positions they occupy would be destroyed by the proletariat, and their counter-revolutionary true faces would be more easily exposed in broad daylight. They are terrified and desperately resist. Thus, they collude and conspire, using counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, using every means to resist Chairman Mao's instructions, and crazily sabotaging the mass movement to learn from the PLA. They maliciously slander the PLA's four firsts and three-eight style as unable to solve problems; using the excuse of the special circumstances of each industry, they deny the universal significance of the PLA's experience; they castrate the revolutionary soul of the PLA's experience, turning it into revisionist black goods that serve production; they also control it organizationally, attempting to lead the great mass movement of learning from the PLA astray. This is a very important aspect of the struggle between the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Their counter-revolutionary crimes in this regard must be severely criticized and thoroughly settled.

(1)

Chairman Mao teaches us: politics is the commander, the soul. The most fundamental and important aspect of learning from the PLA is to learn the experience of the PLA emphasizing politics and holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The PLA's political work has a glorious tradition. In 1929, Chairman Mao personally drafted the great historical document "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party," which pointed out the direction for the construction of the PLA and laid the foundation for the PLA's political work. Over the decades, the PLA's political work experience, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, has been continuously enriched and developed. Especially since Vice Chairman Lin took charge of the work of the Central Military Commission, there has been even greater creative development. In the October 1960 enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission, Vice Chairman Lin proposed the four principles for correctly handling the four relationships in the field of political work. These are: in handling the relationship between weapons and people, placing the human factor in the first position; in handling the relationship between various types of work and political work, placing political work in the first position; in handling the relationship between various types of work and ideological work within political work, placing ideological work in the first position; in handling the relationship between bookish ideas and living ideas, placing living ideas in the first position. The human factor first, political work first, ideological work first, living ideas first—these are the four firsts.

Vice Chairman Lin advocates taking Chairman Mao's three sentences proposed in Yan'an in 1939—"correct political direction, hard work and plain living, flexible tactics"—and the eight characters—"unity, tension, seriousness, liveliness"—as the style of the troops. This is the three-eight style.

Vice Chairman Lin's proposal of the four firsts and the three-eight style is a creative application of Mao Zedong Thought, a high-level summary and scientific generalization of our army's decades of political work experience. It is not only the direction for the PLA's political work but also the direction for political work in all industries and sectors across the nation.

To insist on the four firsts and to promote the three-eight style is to be absolutely loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to always maintain a correct political direction, to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and to ensure that the socialist state will never change color.

To insist on the four firsts is to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to solve the living ideological problems of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, thereby continuously arming the entire army with Mao Zedong Thought, raising the political level and class consciousness of the entire army, making our army a great wall to defend the proletarian dictatorship state, a strong backbone for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and a revolutionary furnace to cultivate a new generation of communists.

Precisely because the four firsts and the three-eight style are the essence of our army's political work experience, learning from the PLA nationwide must learn the experience of the PLA insisting on the four firsts and promoting the three-eight style. Therefore, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are extremely afraid of and hate the four firsts and the three-eight style. To resist and sabotage the nationwide learning from the PLA, they first fiercely attack and slander the four firsts and the three-eight style.

Under the unified planning of the Chinese Khrushchev, the big and small bosses of the bourgeois headquarters clamor to create counter-revolutionary public opinion against the four firsts and the three-eight style. Another major capitalist roader within the Party takes the lead, shouting loudly that learning from the PLA "only talks generally about the four firsts and the three-eight style, which cannot solve problems." The Chinese Khrushchev's agent in the industrial and transportation departments also follows suit, barking wildly: learning from the PLA "cannot just shout the four firsts and be a hands-off supervisor." They sing in unison, maliciously slandering the glorious image of the PLA and greatly belittling the great significance of the PLA's military construction experience. It is extremely arrogant and reactionary!

To slander the four firsts and the three-eight style as "unable to solve problems" is to openly oppose our great leader Chairman Mao, a counter-revolutionary attack on the proletarian headquarters. Chairman Mao has given a high evaluation of the four firsts. Chairman Mao pointed out: the four firsts are good; this is a creation. The PLA's ideological and political work and military work, after Comrade Lin Biao proposed the four firsts and the three-eight style, have developed significantly compared to the past, becoming more concrete and theoretical. Vice Chairman Lin's proposal of the four firsts and the three-eight style not only theoretically explains political work in a scientific and profound way but also more concretely points out the direction and methods of political work. By acting according to the four firsts and the three-eight style, political work in all industries and sectors can be done more actively, truly emphasizing politics, continuously using Mao Zedong Thought to solve the living ideological problems of the broad masses, continuously raising their class consciousness and political level, and truly turning the entire nation into a great school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party fiercely slander the four firsts and the three-eight style as "unable to solve problems," precisely to desperately resist Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from the PLA nationwide," to fiercely sabotage the people of the entire nation learning the essence of the PLA's experience, to continue to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to promote their counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and to restore capitalism. But this is in vain. Their fierce attacks on the four firsts and the three-eight style only further expose the true face of this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists.

(2)

While slandering and attacking the PLA and fiercely denigrating the four firsts and the three-eight style, the Chinese Khrushchev clique also uses "characteristics" as a pretext to deny the universal significance of the PLA's experience. Another major capitalist roader within the Party says: "Factories produce goods, schools teach students, stores sell things, and hospitals treat patients, which is different from the army," and learning from the PLA "must see the characteristics of enterprises and fully pay attention to these characteristics in work." The Chinese Khrushchev's agent in the industrial and transportation departments also parrots: "Schools teach students, stores sell things, hospitals treat patients, and factories produce goods," "this is the characteristic." They painstakingly concocted a set of so-called "characteristics" that the industrial and transportation departments are different from the PLA as their "theoretical basis" for opposing learning from the PLA and threw it out in the form of reports and documents, poisoning the entire nation.

This reactionary "characteristic theory" is a living specimen of waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, a representative work of opportunism and revisionism. The creators of the "characteristic theory" initially listed seven commonalities and eight "characteristics," but later felt this was too blatant, so they merged the eight "characteristics" into seven, making it half and half. When they talk about commonalities, they are hesitant and stuttering, fearing that others will hear; when they talk about "characteristics," they are ecstatic and eloquent, fearing that everyone will not understand. On the one hand, they say that the PLA and the industrial and transportation departments "are both subject to the laws of class struggle"; on the other hand, they emphasize that the activities of the industrial and transportation departments are mainly "subject to the laws of economics and nature." On the one hand, they say that the PLA and the industrial and transportation departments "both have the task of carrying out socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts"; on the other hand, they emphasize that the industrial and transportation departments are mainly "waging war on the earth," and their primary task is to "produce material products." On the one hand, they say that the PLA and the industrial and transportation departments "both need to build a red and expert revolutionary team"; on the other hand, they emphasize that the task of political work in the industrial and transportation departments is mainly to "ensure the rapid, good, and economical development of production." On the one hand, they say that the PLA and the industrial and transportation departments "both must rely on the revolutionary consciousness and initiative of the broad masses"; on the other hand, they emphasize that the industrial and transportation departments implement "material incentives" as more important. And so on. The problem is very clear; they talk about commonalities as a cover, emphasizing "characteristics" as the truth; hesitating to talk about commonalities is to decorate the facade, emphasizing "characteristics" is to deny commonalities. They preach like pastors, endlessly, trying to make people believe: the industrial and transportation departments have their own characteristics, the PLA's experience cannot be learned, cannot be used. This is the essence of their conspiracy to create the reactionary "characteristic theory."

Can the industrial and transportation departments really not learn and use the PLA's experience? No!

The PLA is good first because its politics and ideology are good. The most fundamental aspect of the PLA's experience is to emphasize politics, to vigorously instill the great Mao Zedong Thought into the masses, to firmly grasp the ideological revolutionization of the people, and thereby truly achieve the leadership of everything by Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone knows that in a socialist society, there is always a sharp and complex struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. If any department or place does not use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the positions, bourgeois ideology will inevitably occupy the positions and spread like a plague. Therefore, the PLA's experience of emphasizing politics not only has universal significance but is also a reliable guarantee for our country to never change color. The people of the entire nation learning from the PLA not only can but must learn, this is a top priority that decides the fate of our country, and a top priority that decides the victory or defeat of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads.

At the same time, practical experience has also proven that the industrial and transportation departments can completely learn the PLA's experience. The Daqing model, which is the most persuasive example of learning from the PLA, has given the creators of the "characteristic theory" a resounding slap in the face. Facts have proven that the PLA's experience of emphasizing politics embodies the universal truth of Mao Zedong Thought and is completely applicable to all departments and units. Wherever the PLA's experience is learned, revolutionary spirit is greatly inspired, the appearance is completely renewed, and socialist undertakings make rapid progress.

Using the excuse of characteristics to deny commonalities and universal truths is a trick commonly used by all opportunists. The Chinese Khrushchev clique is precisely such a group of opportunists. The "characteristic theory" they peddle is precisely the great exposure of their counter-revolutionary characteristics of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

(3)

The Chinese Khrushchev clique, in opposing Chairman Mao's instructions and resisting learning from the PLA, uses another extremely treacherous and despicable tactic: castrating the revolutionary soul of the PLA's experience, falsifying the nature and tasks of political work, and using a revisionist set to pass off counterfeits and impersonate.

Vice Chairman Lin points out: "Always holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, arming the minds of the people of the entire nation with Mao Zedong Thought, and insisting on Mao Zedong Thought taking command in all work is the most fundamental task of our Party's political and ideological work." Learning from the PLA is to be like the PLA, firmly grasping the ideological revolutionization of the people. With people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we can insist on the proletarian political direction, carry the socialist revolution to the end, and ensure that the proletarian iron mountain will never change.

The Chinese Khrushchev clique, to castrate the revolutionary spirit of the PLA's experience, maliciously falsifies the fundamental task of political work. When they stipulate the tasks of political work in the industrial and transportation departments, they do not mention Mao Zedong Thought or the ideological revolutionization of the people but instead vigorously advocate that political work should "serve production and construction" and "ensure the rapid, good, and economical development of production." They everywhere advocate that "so-called political command is to command production," blathering that political work should "start from production," should "revolve around production," should "land on production," and so on. According to their fallacies, politics is merely a means to complete production tasks, where is the commander, where is the soul? According to their fallacies, politics is a means, production is the goal, politics is a servant, production is the master, therefore, as long as production is completed, who cares about politics or not? According to their fallacies, what is the ideological revolutionization of the people, what is class struggle awareness, all are unnecessary, production is good, politics is good, production goes up, and political work has completed its task.

They use this trick of passing off counterfeits to replace emphasizing politics, thereby fundamentally falsifying the revolutionary spirit of "learning from the PLA nationwide," attempting to falsify it into something suitable for the needs of restoring capitalism.

They use the "four goods for one good (production is good)" movement, which emphasizes production, to replace the PLA's four-good units and five-good soldiers movement, which emphasizes politics.

They stubbornly insist on production first, technology first, profit first, and material incentives first, using these "four firsts" soaked in revisionist poison to oppose the four firsts proposed by Comrade Lin Biao.

They rack their brains to create a so-called "four-four style" that suits the characteristics of the industrial and transportation departments, attempting to use this to replace the excellent style formed by our Party and army in long-term revolutionary struggles—the three-eight style.

The facts are very clear; what they want to emphasize is not proletarian politics but bourgeois politics. What they want to expand is not the proletarian position but the bourgeois position. What they want to develop is not socialist production but capitalist production. What they advocate is "serving production and construction," which is completely a deceptive cover. The essence is to serve their evil purpose of restoring capitalism.

To implement a policy, corresponding organizational measures must be taken. The industrial and transportation front, to carry out the great mass movement of learning from the PLA, must correspondingly establish political work institutions and cultivate and build a team of political work cadres. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev, to sabotage Chairman Mao's great strategic measure of "learning from the PLA nationwide," also played various tricks in organizational measures. The Chinese Khrushchev even personally took the lead, bare-chested, to carry out crazy sabotage. He colluded with another major capitalist roader within the Party, instructing his agents in the industrial and transportation departments to concoct a so-called "decision," stipulating that the political organs at all levels in the industrial and transportation departments should be managed by the economic organs at the same level, placing the political organs under the leadership of the economic organs. This is a new variant of the bourgeois military line of "military leading politics" and "command headquarters facing outward" that Chairman Mao has long criticized in the industrial and transportation departments. Their evil intentions are to lead the construction of political organs astray from the beginning, to serve their counter-revolutionary revisionist line and restore capitalism.

To strengthen the construction of political work, in addition to needing to send a portion of strong and possibly transferable political cadres and military cadres who understand politics from the PLA to the industrial, commercial, and agricultural departments, it is more necessary to send capable comrades from the industrial and other departments to the PLA's army, division, and regiment for several months of study, or to the PLA's political academies to be students, to graduate on time, and return to work. While the Chinese Khrushchev, to obstruct the learning of the PLA's experience, loudly shouted: "Squatting a few times, conducting a few rounds of the Four Clean-ups, and you will learn political work." He ordered the suspension of various political cadre training classes that teach the PLA's experience. He forcibly stopped the dispatch of cadres to the PLA's political academies and units for study. He instigated his agents in the industrial and transportation departments to use every means to exclude and strike down cadres transferred from the PLA to work in the industrial and transportation departments. Look, how arrogant the reactionary momentum of this old counter-revolutionary is! How poisonous the counter-revolutionary means are!

The Four Clean-ups movement carried out according to Chairman Mao's instructions is a great socialist revolutionary movement. Political work cadres should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go to the fiery class struggle to temper themselves and learn the skills of class struggle. However, the Chinese Khrushchev wants political work cadres to go down to conduct the Four Clean-ups, which is a carefully planned great conspiracy. We only need to see the notorious "Taoyuan Experience" carefully concocted by the Chinese Khrushchev to understand what kind of goods his peddled "Four Clean-ups," "squatting," and "political work" are.

His so-called "Four Clean-ups" is to stand on the bourgeois position, to promote the reactionary line of "left" in form and right in essence, to "strike a large area and protect a small number." This is not the Four Clean-ups at all but a fake Four Clean-ups and a true restoration.

His so-called "squatting" is to take root and connect, to gather followers, to cultivate the seedlings of revisionism, and to plant the roots of capitalism. This squatting is precisely to carefully cultivate black strongholds for restoring capitalism.

His so-called "political work" is to take charge, to issue orders, to deceive the masses; it is to threaten, bribe, track, and torture. Whose political work is this? It is the Kuomintang's "political tutelage," it is the fascist counter-revolutionary deeds.

The situation is clear: the Chinese Khrushchev is in a hurry to drive the cadres of political organs at all levels down to conduct the Four Clean-ups and squatting, precisely to obstruct them from learning from the PLA, and to use his counter-revolutionary revisionist politics to poison the cadres. He attempts to use this vicious and cunning counter-revolutionary means to cultivate political work cadres into tools for him to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. This is the crux of the matter, this is the essence of the problem.

"The golden monkey wields the thousand-pound rod, the jade sky is cleansed of ten thousand evils." The bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev has gone from causing trouble—failure—causing more trouble—failure again, to complete annihilation. The Chinese Khrushchev clique's evil conspiracy to oppose the great call of "learning from the PLA nationwide" has completely failed. Learning from the PLA nationwide has become an irresistible great historical tide.

We, the revolutionary cadres of the industrial and transportation front, will carry out Chairman Mao's instructions one thousand times, ten thousand times! We must always learn from the PLA and always walk the path of political construction of the army. The PLA's experience has been newly created and developed in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a model for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, a model for emphasizing proletarian politics, a model for insisting on the four firsts and promoting the three-eight style. In executing the glorious and arduous tasks of "supporting the left," "military control," and "military assistance" given by Chairman Mao, it has made great efforts and established great merits, becoming the most important guarantee for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must push the mass movement of learning from the PLA in the industrial and transportation system to a new and higher stage. We must, like the PLA, firmly establish the absolute authority of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must vigorously emphasize proletarian politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to build an extremely proletarianized and extremely revolutionary industrial army, and turn the industrial and transportation system into a red Mao Zedong Thought school!

　　大学解放军，永远突出无产阶级政治
　　——批判中国赫鲁晓夫之流反对向解放军学习的滔天罪行
　　中央工交政治部　谷田
    四个第一好，这是个创造。解放军的思想政治工作和军事工作，经林彪同志提出四个第一、三八作风之后，比较过去有了一个很大的发展，更具体化又更理论化了。
　　毛泽东
    中国人民解放军，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的举世无双的人民军队，是我国无产阶级专政的最强大的支柱。她在任何时候、任何情况下，都无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，给全国人民树立了光辉的榜样。
    四年前，当以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部之间的斗争，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，在新的形势下尖锐地展开的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了“全国学人民解放军”的伟大号召。毛主席并指示国家工业各部门从上至下（即从部到厂矿）都学解放军，都设政治部、政治处和政治指导员，实行四个第一和三八作风。这是一个意义十分深远的伟大号召，这是防修反修的一项伟大的战略措施。只要全国人民学习人民解放军，象人民解放军那样，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，那么，党内一小撮走资派在我国复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋就永远不能得逞，我们无产阶级专政的国家就永远不会改变颜色。
    毛主席的伟大号召，集中地反映了全国人民的强烈愿望，也是对工交战线千百万职工最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的激励，最大的鞭策。广大职工积极响应毛主席的号召，迅速掀起了群众性的学习解放军的热潮，在革命化的大道上阔步前进。
    毛主席的伟大号召，是向资产阶级所盘踞的一切阵地发动新的反攻的动员令，它犹如一声惊雷，震撼了大地，国内外一切牛鬼蛇神惊恐万状。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派，凭着他们反革命的阶级敏感，意识到全国人民大学解放军，大搞革命化以后，他们的反革命修正主义路线就更加无法推行，他们复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋更难以实现，他们所占领的一切阵地就要被无产阶级摧毁，他们的反革命的真面目，就更容易暴露在光天化日之下。他们胆战心惊，拚命反抗。于是他们串通一气，狼狈为奸，施展反革命两面手法，打着“红旗”反红旗，千方百计地抵制毛主席的指示，疯狂破坏大学解放军的群众运动。他们极力污蔑人民解放军的四个第一、三八作风不能解决问题；借口各行各业情况特殊，否定人民解放军经验的普遍意义；阉割人民解放军经验的革命灵魂，把它篡改成政治为生产服务的修正主义黑货；他们更从组织上进行控制，妄图把全国学人民解放军的伟大群众运动引向歧途。这是党内最大的一小撮走资派同以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部进行尖锐斗争的一个十分重要的方面。对于他们在这方面犯下的反革命罪行，必须痛加批判，彻底清算。
    （一）
    毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。全国学人民解放军，最根本最主要的就是把人民解放军突出政治、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的经验学到手。
    人民解放军的政治工作有着光荣的传统。毛主席在一九二九年亲自起草的伟大的历史文件《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，指明了人民解放军建设的方向，奠定了人民解放军政治工作的基础。几十年来，人民解放军的政治工作经验，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，不断地丰富和发展，特别是自从林副主席主持中共中央军委工作以来，更有极大的创造性的发展。一九六○年十月中共中央军委扩大会议上，林副主席提出了正确处理政治工作领域中四个关系的四个原则。这就是：在处理武器和人的关系中，把人的因素放在第一位；在处理各种工作和政治工作的关系中，把政治工作放在第一位；在处理政治工作中的各种工作和思想工作的关系中，把思想工作放在第一位；在处理书本思想和活的思想的关系中，把活的思想放在第一位。人的因素第一，政治工作第一，思想工作第一，活的思想第一，这就是四个第一。
    林副主席提倡把毛主席一九三九年在延安提出的“坚定正确的政治方向，艰苦朴素的工作作风，灵活机动的战略战术”三句话，和“团结、紧张、严肃、活泼”八个字，作为部队的作风，这就是三八作风。
    林副主席提出四个第一、三八作风，是创造性地运用毛泽东思想的光辉典范，是对我军几十年政治工作经验的高度概括和科学总结。它不仅是人民解放军政治工作的方向，而且也是全国各行各业政治工作的方向。
    坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风就是要无限忠于我们伟大领袖毛主席，无限忠于伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是要大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，永远保持坚定正确的政治方向，巩固无产阶级专政，保证社会主义江山永不变色。
    坚持四个第一，就是坚持以战无不胜的毛泽东思想去解决广大指战员的活的思想问题，从而不断地用毛泽东思想武装全军，提高全军的政治水平和阶级觉悟，使我军成为捍卫无产阶级专政国家的伟大长城，成为世界人民革命斗争的坚强后盾，成为毛泽东思想的大学校，成为培育共产主义一代新人的革命大熔炉。
    正由于四个第一和三八作风是我军政治工作经验的精华，全国学习人民解放军，就要把解放军坚持四个第一和大兴三八作风的经验学到手。因此，党内最大的一小撮走资派就对四个第一和三八作风怕得要死，恨得要命，他们为了抵制和破坏全国人民学习解放军，首先就拚命攻击和污蔑四个第一和三八作风。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫的统一策划下，资产阶级司令部的大小头目，鼓噪而起，大造反对四个第一和三八作风的反革命舆论。党内另一个最大的走资派，一马当先，大叫大嚷学习解放军“只笼统讲四个第一、三八作风，是不能解决问题的。”中国赫鲁晓夫在工交部门的代理人也紧跟着狂吠：学习解放军“不能光喊四个第一，当甩手掌柜。”他们一唱一和，恶毒污蔑解放军的光辉形象，极力贬低解放军建军经验的伟大意义。真是猖狂之极，反动透顶！
    污蔑四个第一和三八作风“不能解决问题”，这是明目张胆地同我们伟大领袖毛主席唱反调，这是向无产阶级司令部的猖狂反扑。毛主席对四个第一作了高度的评价，毛主席指出：四个第一好，这是个创造。解放军的思想政治工作和军事工作，经林彪同志提出四个第一、三八作风之后，比较过去有了一个很大的发展，更具体化又更理论化了。林副主席提出四个第一、三八作风，不仅从理论上对政治工作进行了科学的深刻的阐释，而且更具体地指明了政治工作的方向、方法。按照四个第一、三八作风办事，就能够使各行各业政治工作越做越活，就能够真正做到突出政治，就能够不断用毛泽东思想来解决广大群众的活思想问题，不断提高他们的阶级觉悟和政治水平，就能够把全国办成活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校。党内最大的一小撮走资派所以猖狂污蔑四个第一和三八作风“不能解决问题”，就是为了拚命抵制毛主席“全国学人民解放军”的伟大号召，就是为了极力破坏全国人民把解放军经验的精华学到手，就是为了继续对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，推行他们那一套反革命修正主义路线，复辟资本主义。但这是枉费心机。他们拚命攻击四个第一和三八作风，只不过更加暴露了他们这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的真实面目而已。

    中国赫鲁晓夫之流在污蔑、攻击解放军，极力诋毁四个第一和三八作风的同时，又以“特性”为幌子，来否定解放军经验的普遍意义。党内另一个最大的走资派胡说什么：“工厂要做工，学校要上课，商店要做生意，同军队不同”，学习解放军“要看到企业的特点，在工作中要充分注意这个特点”。中国赫鲁晓夫在工交部门的代理人也鹦鹉学舌地说：“学校是教学生的，商店是卖东西的，医院是看病的，工厂是搞生产的”，“这就是特性”。他们煞费苦心地拼凑了一套“工交部门和解放军不同”的所谓几大“特性”，作为他们反对学习解放军的“理论根据”，并以作报告、发文件的形式抛出，流毒全国。
    这个反动的“特性论”，是打着“红旗”反红旗的活标本，是折衷主义、机会主义的代表作。“特性论”的炮制者，起初开列了七条共性，八条“特性”，后来感到这样太露骨了，又把八条“特性”合并为七条，来了个一半对一半。他们讲共性时，忸忸怩怩，吞吞吐吐，生怕别人听进去；讲“特性”时，手舞足蹈，滔滔不绝，唯恐大家听不懂。他们一方面说，解放军和工交部门“都受阶级斗争规律的支配”；另一方面又强调，工交部门的活动主要是“受经济规律和自然规律的支配”。一方面说，解放军和工交部门“都有在政治战线、思想战线进行社会主义革命的任务”；另一方面又强调，工交部门主要“是对地球开战”的“经济组织”，第一位的任务是“要出物质产品”。一方面说，解放军和工交部门“都要建设一支又红又专的革命化的队伍”；另一方面又强调，工交部门“政治工作的任务”，主要“是保证多快好省地发展生产”。一方面说，解放军和工交部门“都必须依靠广大群众的革命自觉性和积极性”；另一方面又强调，工交部门实行“物质鼓励”“更为重要”。等等，等等。问题十分明显，他们讲共性是假，强调“特性”是真；吞吞吐吐讲共性是为了装潢门面，强调“特性”是为了否定共性。他们象牧师说教一样，呶呶不休，硬要人们相信：工交部门有自己的特性，解放军的经验不能学，不能用。这就是他们精心炮制反动的“特性论”的阴谋所在。
    解放军的经验，工交部门真的不能学、不能用吗？否！
    解放军好首先是政治思想好。解放军的经验最根本的就是突出政治，向群众大力灌输伟大的毛泽东思想，狠抓人的思想革命化，从而真正作到用毛泽东思想统帅一切。大家知道，社会主义社会始终存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐复杂的斗争。任何部门、任何地方，如果不用毛泽东思想去占领阵地，资产阶级思想必然要占领阵地，泛滥成灾。因此，解放军突出政治的经验不但具有普遍意义，而且是使我们国家永不变色的可靠保证。全国人民大学解放军，不但能够学，而且必须学，这是决定我国命运的头等大事，这是决定两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争谁胜谁负的头等大事。
    同时，实践经验也肯定了工交部门是完全能够把解放军的经验学到手的。大庆这个学习解放军的最有说服力的典型，就给了“特性论”的炮制者一记最响亮的耳光。事实雄辩地证明，解放军突出政治的经验，体现了毛泽东思想的普遍真理，对一切部门、一切单位都是完全适用的，用到那里那里灵。那里学了解放军的经验，那里就革命精神大振，面貌焕然一新，社会主义事业就突飞猛进。
    借口特性否定共性，否定普遍真理，是一切机会主义者所惯用的手法。中国赫鲁晓夫之流正是这样一伙机会主义者。他们所兜售的“特性论”，正是他们反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命特性的大暴露。
    （三）
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流，对抗毛主席的指示，反对学习解放军的又一个极其阴险的卑劣手法就是：阉割解放军经验的革命灵魂，篡改政治工作的性质和任务，用修正主义的一套来鱼目混珠，冒名顶替。
    林副主席指出：“永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装全国人民的头脑，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，是我党政治思想工作最根本的任务。”学习解放军，就是要象解放军那样狠抓人的思想革命化。有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就能坚持无产阶级的政治方向，把社会主义革命进行到底，保证无产阶级的铁打江山永不变质。有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就能克服一切困难，创造任何人间奇迹，推动社会主义建设飞跃发展。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之流，为了阉割解放军经验的革命精神，就恶毒篡改政治工作的根本任务。他们在规定工交部门政治工作的任务时，只字不提毛泽东思想，不提人的思想革命化，却大肆鼓吹政治工作要“为生产建设服务”，“保证多快好省地发展生产”。他们到处鼓吹“所谓政治挂帅，就是要挂到生产上去”，胡说什么政治工作要“从生产出发”，要“围绕生产”，要“落脚到生产”，等等。按照他们这种谬论，政治不过是完成生产任务的一种手段，那里还算得上是统帅是灵魂？按照他们这种谬论，政治是手段，生产是目的，政治是仆从，生产是主人，因此，只要生产完成了，那管什么政治不政治？按照他们这种谬论，什么人的思想革命化，什么阶级斗争观念，统统没有必要，生产好就是政治好，生产上去了，政治工作就算完成了任务。
    他们就是这样玩弄鱼目混珠的伎俩，用突出生产顶替突出政治，从而从根本上篡改“全国学人民解放军”的革命精神，妄图把它篡改成适合资本主义复辟需要的东西。
    他们用“四好为一好（生产好）”的突出生产的所谓“五好”运动，代替解放军的突出政治的四好连队和五好战士运动。
    他们顽固地坚持生产第一、技术第一、利润第一、物质刺激第一，用这些浸透修正主义毒素的“四个第一”，对抗林彪同志提出的四个第一。
    他们挖空心思地制造了一个所谓适合工交部门特点的“四四作风”，妄图以此代替我党我军在长期革命斗争中形成的优良作风——三八作风。
    事实非常清楚，他们所要突出的，根本不是无产阶级政治，而是资产阶级政治。他们所要扩大的，根本不是无产阶级的阵地，而是资产阶级的阵地。他们所要发展的生产，根本不是社会主义生产，而正是资本主义的生产。他们所标榜的“为生产建设服务”，完全是骗人的幌子，实质上就是要为他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的服务。
    （四）
    贯彻执行一项方针政策，需要采取相应的组织措施。工交战线为了开展学习人民解放军的伟大群众运动，就需要相应地建立政治工作机构，培养建立一支政治工作的干部队伍。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派为了破坏毛主席的“全国学人民解放军”这一伟大战略措施，在组织措施上也施展了种种阴谋诡计。中国赫鲁晓夫还亲自出马，赤膊上阵，进行疯狂的破坏。他伙同党内另一个最大的走资派，指使他们在工交部门的代理人搞了一个所谓“决定”，规定工交部门各级政治机关，要由同级的经济机关代管，把政治机关置于经济机关的领导之下，这是毛主席早就批判了的“军事领导政治”、“司令部对外”的资产阶级军事路线在工交部门的新变种。其险恶用心，就是一开始就把政治机关的建设引上邪路，为他们推行反革命修正主义路线、复辟资本主义服务。
    为了加强政治工作建设，除了需要从解放军抽出一部分强的而又可能调出的政治干部和懂政治的军事干部送到工、商、农部门中去以外，更需要由工业及其它部门派得力同志到解放军的军、师、团去学习几个月，或者到解放军的政治院校去当学生，按期毕业，回去工作。而中国赫鲁晓夫为了阻挠学习解放军的经验，就大叫大嚷：“蹲几次点，搞几期四清，就学会了政治工作。”他下令停办传授解放军经验的各种政治干部训练班。他强行停派干部到解放军政治院校和部队去学习。他唆使他在工交部门的代理人千方百计地排斥和打击从解放军调到工交部门工作的干部。看，这个老反革命的反动气焰多么嚣张！反革命的手段又是多么毒辣！
    根据毛主席指示开展的四清运动，是一场伟大的社会主义革命运动。政治工作干部应该遵照毛主席的教导，到火热的阶级斗争中去经受锻炼，学会阶级斗争的本领。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫要政治工作干部下去搞四清，则完全是一个包藏祸心的大阴谋。我们只要从中国赫鲁晓夫精心炮制的、臭名昭著的“桃园经验”中就不难看出，他所兜售的“四清”、“蹲点”和“政治工作”，究竟是些什么货色。
    他的所谓“四清”，就是站在资产阶级立场上，推行形“左”实右的反动路线，“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。这根本不是什么四清，而是假四清，真复辟。
    他的所谓“蹲点”，就是扎根串连，网罗亲信，选修正主义之苗，扎资本主义之根。这种蹲点，正是为了精心培植复辟资本主义的黑据点。
    他的所谓“政治工作”，就是包办代替，发号施令，妖言惑众；就是威胁利诱、跟踪盯梢、体罚逼供。这是哪一家的政治工作？是国民党的“训政”，是法西斯的反革命行径。
    事情就是这样摆着：中国赫鲁晓夫迫不及待地要把各级政治机关干部赶下去搞四清蹲点，就是为了阻挠他们向解放军取经，并且要用他那一套反革命修正主义的政治去毒害干部。他妄图用这种狠毒奸诈的反革命手法，把政治工作干部培植成为他推行反革命修正主义路线的工具，成为他颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的工具。这就是问题的要害，这就是问题的实质。
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，已从捣乱——失败——再捣乱——再失败，走向了彻底灭亡。中国赫鲁晓夫之流反对“全国学人民解放军”这一伟大号召的罪恶阴谋也已彻底破产。全国学人民解放军已成为不可阻挡的伟大历史潮流。
    我们工交战线的无产阶级革命派，对伟大领袖毛主席的指示，一千个照办，一万个照办！我们要永远学习解放军，永远走政治建军的路。解放军的经验，在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中又有了新的创造、新的发展。中国人民解放军是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的模范，是突出无产阶级政治的模范，是坚持四个第一、大兴三八作风的模范，在执行毛主席交给的“三支”、“两军”的光荣而艰巨的任务中，作出了巨大的努力，建立了伟大的功勋，是无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的最重要的保证。我们一定要把工交系统学习解放军的群众运动，推进到一个更新更高的阶段。我们要象解放军那样，大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威。我们要大力突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想建设非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的产业大军，把工交系统办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
