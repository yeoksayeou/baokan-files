1967 was a year in which our army extensively and deeply engaged with the masses, went to the front lines of class struggle, and undertook the glorious and arduous tasks of "three supports" and "two militaries." The first half of the year is about to end, and comrades from various places have returned to their units. Gathering together to summarize the experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the "three supports" and "two militaries" is a very precious opportunity.

Breaking private interests and establishing public interests, correctly handling criticism from the masses, is the first problem I encountered this year. This problem cannot be avoided; it must be solved. In the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, if one does not seriously transform oneself and earnestly break private interests and establish public interests, one cannot fully serve the people and cannot keep up with the current revolutionary situation. My non-proletarian thoughts are mainly manifested in arrogance, self-satisfaction, and localism. These are reflections of bourgeois ideology, harmful to unity, and weaken collective leadership. The root of all this is the character "self." If we do not seize the power of the "self" in our minds, we cannot become proletarian revolutionaries, cannot complete the tasks assigned by the people of our country, and may not even pass the test of socialism. "Self" at the forefront is not in line with our socialist economic base and violates the laws of social development. If we remain unaware for a long time, we will be eliminated by the revolution. Comrade Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution must also revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not succeed."

The "self" in our minds is a deep-rooted remnant of thousands of years of private ownership. Breaking private interests and establishing public interests is a very intense and profound revolution, a revolution to thoroughly eliminate all bourgeois ideology and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. This revolution must first rely on self-revolution and place oneself among the broad masses. Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." To break private interests, we must rely on the power of the masses and launch a "people's war." Let the masses help you "reconnoiter" and "judge," and you make a resolute decision to make good "battle arrangements," concentrate your forces, strike at the heart, fight continuously, pursue relentlessly, and only then can you succeed. Whether or not you dare to do this is a question of whether you are willing to break with "self," whether you want to be a proletarian revolutionary, and it is also a touchstone for true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries.

Breaking private interests and establishing public interests involves three steps:

1. Thoroughly expose. This is the first step in transforming one's worldview. Whether or not you dare to expose is a question of being revolutionary or not. How deeply you expose is a question of whether the revolution is thorough or not. To expose thoroughly, accurately, and deeply, you must get rid of the character "fear" and establish the character "dare." The so-called "fear": first, fear of losing face; second, fear of losing reputation; third, fear of being criticized; fourth, fear of losing authority. In a word, it is fear of the masses and fear of the revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "A thorough materialist is fearless," "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we still have personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, and can we still have errors that we cannot abandon?" Proletarian revolutionaries, for the Party, for the people, for the revolution, can have their heads cut off and blood shed, so why can't they expose their ugliness? Ugly things in one's thoughts are objectively existing, and they cannot be avoided or evaded. Not acknowledging them is self-deception. Having ugliness and exposing it, the masses will not say you are ugly; having ugliness and not exposing it, the masses will think you are dirty. For the revolution, exposing ugliness is not afraid of this or that. Fear of ugliness is not being a proletarian revolutionary. Therefore, exposing thoughts must have high standards: (1) Cut to the soul, see the big in the small, and strike heavily; (2) Lay it all out, spread it all out, turn everything upside down, just like a thorough spring cleaning. Whether or not you dare to expose depends on how much you hate wrong thoughts. The deeper you hate, the better you can expose. On the battlefield filled with gunfire, the bravery of revolutionary soldiers comes from their deep hatred of class enemies. For the enemies in one's thoughts, only by hating them deeply can you expose them thoroughly. The enemies in one's thoughts are time bombs hidden in our minds. We must resolutely decide to eliminate them, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties.

In the past half year, when I talked with comrades individually or discussed issues, I always felt that I had to talk about my own shortcomings, otherwise, I would feel guilty. Talking like this, living examples, comrades listened and felt it was vivid. From the time I enlisted to now, how have I come this far? Where did my progress come from? Generally speaking, listening to Chairman Mao's words, I would move forward bravely; going against Chairman Mao's teachings, I would take the wrong path. Whether soldiers or cadres, it is the same.

2. Resolutely fight. In the entire process of transforming one's worldview, one must grasp the key points and the main contradictions. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In any process where there are multiple contradictions, there must be one that is principal, playing a leading and decisive role, while the others are in a secondary and subordinate position. Therefore, when studying any process where there are two or more contradictions, one must use all one's strength to find the principal contradiction. Once the principal contradiction is grasped, all problems will be solved."

Food must be eaten bite by bite, and enemies must be eliminated one by one. Fighting private interests must be a battle of annihilation. Some comrades say: "Don't cut leeks, pull out green onions." Yes, that's right, resolutely fight them down, fight them to ruin, fight them to stink, fight until your face is flushed, you sweat, you can't eat, and you can't sleep. (Comrades gave some opinions, and I couldn't sleep, fighting hard. I thought: Comrades giving me opinions is the greatest concern and love from class brothers, and revolution cannot do without this kind of love.) In a word, do not fear pain. Lightly describing, not hurting, only fighting on the periphery, not fighting in depth, fighting and stopping, dodging and evading, discounting, haggling, turning big issues into small ones, and small issues into nothing, cannot complete the thought revolution.

In the process of fighting private interests, one must actively and proactively fight, set up the battlefield in the depths of one's soul, actively challenge oneself, "command" one's "army," give oneself a hard time, and fight back-to-back. Where it hurts, charge there; where it is stubborn, fight there. Focus on the big picture, start with the small details, have a big goal in mind, and fight a protracted war overall. Chairman Mao said: "Do not be intimidated by the enemy's fierce momentum, do not be discouraged by the difficulties that can still be endured, do not be disheartened by some setbacks, and give the necessary patience and perseverance." The "self" left over from thousands of years cannot be feared, but its long-term and stubborn nature must be fully estimated. Therefore, overall, one must fight a protracted war, and on specific issues, one must fight decisive and annihilating battles. Fight often, fight repeatedly, fight to the end, fight to the death.

Thought revolution mainly relies on oneself, but it also cannot do without the help of comrades. One must actively fight oneself and also seek the help of others. Therefore, one must correctly handle the opinions of the masses. Especially when others raise opinions that are incorrect, do not conform to the facts, or are completely wrong, one must still listen. One must do the following: (1) Not calculate the object, "no matter who it is, anyone can point it out to us"; (2) Not calculate the occasion, regardless of whether it is in a meeting or not, in a big meeting or a small meeting, as long as it is raised, it is warmly welcomed; (3) Not calculate the attitude, regardless of whether the tone is harsh or soft, loud or soft, good words, or words with thorns, one must be able to sit still and listen; (4) Not calculate the degree, regardless of whether the problem is light or heavy, many or few, "the speaker is without guilt, the listener is sufficiently warned"; (5) Not calculate the method, regardless of whether it is face-to-face or back-to-back. In short, insist on truth, correct errors, get rid of selfish thoughts, accept criticism for the people, and accept criticism for the revolution.

3. Decisively transform. Transformation is the continuation of exposure and fighting, it is the key, the purpose, a qualitative leap, and a more arduous and profound self-revolution. If one neglects transformation, it is a half-hearted revolution, and all previous efforts will be in vain. (1) One must transform oneself thoroughly, have strong willpower, high awareness, and do what one says. Live a few years, transform a few years, if one cannot transform, one will die with regret. (2) One must take active learners of Chairman Mao's works as examples and study and use the "Three Articles" diligently. (3) One must face storms and hardships, temper oneself in class struggle, especially in the great storms of the Cultural Revolution, to promote thought revolutionization.

Exposure is the premise, fighting is the key, and transformation is the implementation. These three steps are indispensable. Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Transforming oneself is a painful, long-term, and arduous process. One must make up one's mind, study diligently, temper oneself repeatedly, transform thoroughly, and act according to Chairman Mao's teachings in everything, in order to become a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

    彻底地亮　狠狠地斗　坚决地改
    ——李文忠同志生前思想汇报提纲
    一九六七年是我军广泛深入群众，走向阶级斗争的第一线，担负“三支”“两军”光荣而又艰巨的任务的一年。上半年就要结束了，同志们从各个地方回到了连队，坐到一块总结在“三支”“两军”工作中活学活用毛主席著作的经验，这是一个非常难得的机会。
    破私立公，正确对待群众的批评，是我今年一开始首先遇到的问题。这个问题不能回避，只能解决。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，不认真地改造自己，不严肃地破私立公，是不能做到全心全意为人民服务的，就跟不上当前革命形势的需要。我的非无产阶级思想，集中地表现在骄傲自满、本位主义。这是资产阶级思想的反映，危害团结，削弱集体领导。它的总根就是一个“私”字。如果不把头脑里的“私”字的权夺过来，就不能成为一个无产阶级革命战士，就不能完成祖国人民交给的任务，甚至就过不了社会主义这一关。“私”字当头，不适合我们社会主义的经济基础，违背社会发展规律，长期不觉悟，就会被革命淘汰。林副主席说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”
    我们头脑里的“私”字，是几千年来私有制遗留下来的，是根深蒂固的。破私立公，是一场极其激烈、深刻的革命，是彻底消灭一切资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想的革命。这个革命首先要靠自我革命，又要把自己置身于广大群众之中。毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”破私，要依靠群众的力量，开展“人民战争”。群众帮你“侦察”、“判断”，自己下决心作好“战斗部署”，集中力量，直插中心，连续作战，穷追猛打，才能完成。敢不敢这样做，是愿不愿同“私”字决裂，想不想做一个无产阶级革命战士的问题，也是真革命和假革命的试金石。
    破私立公，分三个步骤：
    一、彻底地亮。这是改造世界观的第一步。敢不敢亮，是革命和不革命的问题。亮得深不深，是革命彻底不彻底的问题。要亮得准、深、彻底，必须去掉“怕”字，树立一个“敢”字。所谓“怕”：一怕丢丑；二怕丢名；三怕挨斗；四怕丧失威信。一句话，就是怕群众，怕革命。毛主席教导我们：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”，“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”无产阶级革命战士为党为人民为革命，头可断血可流，为什么有丑亮不得呢？思想上的丑东西，是客观存在，躲也躲不开，回避也回避不了，不承认是自欺欺人。有丑亮出来，群众不说你丑；有丑不亮，群众觉得你肮脏。为革命亮丑就不怕这，不怕那。怕丑就不是无产阶级革命战士。因此，亮思想要高标准：（一）向灵魂深处开刀，小中见大，刺得重一点，打中要害；（二）全盘端，摆开摊，翻箱倒柜，就象除夕大扫除。敢不敢亮，决定于对错误思想恨不恨，恨得深，才能亮得好。在战火纷飞的战场上，革命战士的勇敢来自对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨。对思想上的敌人，只有恨得深，才能亮得干脆。思想上的敌人，是埋藏在我们头脑里的一颗定时炸弹，要下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，坚决挖掉它。
    这半年来，我和同志们个别谈话，或讲什么问题，总觉得不谈上一阵自己的缺点就过意不去。这样谈，活人活教材，同志们听了也感到生动。从我入伍到现在，这段是怎样走过来的？进步是怎样来的？总的说来，听毛主席的话，就勇往直前，违背毛主席的教导，就要走上邪路。不论战士、干部，统统如此。
    二、狠狠地斗。在整个改造世界观的过程中，要抓住要害，抓主要矛盾。毛主席教导我们：“任何过程如果有多数矛盾存在的话，其中必定有一种是主要的，起着领导的、决定的作用，其他则处于次要和服从的地位。因此，研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”
    饭要一口一口地吃，敌人要一个一个地消灭。斗私，要打歼灭战。有的同志说：“不要割韭菜，要拔大葱。”对，就要这样，坚决把它斗倒斗垮斗臭，要斗到脸上发烧，身上出汗，吃不下饭，睡不着觉。（同志们提了些意见，我就睡不着觉，狠狠地斗。想：同志给我提意见，这是阶级兄弟最大的关心，最大的爱护，要革命，少了这种爱是不行的。）一句话，就是不怕疼。轻描淡写，不痛不痒，只打外围战，不打纵深仗，斗斗停停，躲躲闪闪，打折扣，讲价钱，大事化小，小事化了，是不能完成思想革命的。
    在斗私的过程中，一定要积极主动地斗，在灵魂深处摆战场，主动向自己挑战，“将”自己的“军”，要给自己过不去，要针锋相对地斗。那里痛，就向那里冲，那里顽固，就向那里打。大处着眼，小处着手，心怀大目标，总体上打持久战。毛主席说：“不为敌之其势汹汹所吓倒，不为尚能忍耐的困难所沮丧，不为某些挫折而灰心，给予必要的耐心和持久，是完全必要的。”几千年留下来的“私”字，绝对不能怕它，但又必须充分地估计到它的长期性、顽固性。因此，在总体上要打持久战，在具体问题上要打速决战，歼灭战。经常斗，反复斗，斗到底，斗到死。
    思想革命，主要靠自己，但也不可缺少同志们的帮助。要自己主动地斗，又要别人帮助，这样，就必须正确对待群众的意见。特别是别人提了有出入、有不符合事实、甚至完全不对的意见，也要听。要做到：（一）不计较对象，“不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行”；（二）不计较场合，不管人多人少，会内会外，大会小会，只要提出来就热烈欢迎；（三）不计较态度，不管气粗气细，声大声小，好话，带刺的话，都要能坐得住，听得进；（四）不计较分寸，不管程度轻重，问题多少，“言者无罪，闻者足戒”；（五）不计较方式，不管是面对面、背靠背。总之，坚持真理，修正错误，去掉私心杂念，为了人民而接受批评，为了革命而接受批评。
    三、坚决地改。改是亮、斗的继续，是重点，是目的，是质的飞跃，是更艰苦更深刻的自我革命。要是忽视了改，就是半截子革命，就会前功尽弃。（一）要脱胎换骨地改造自己，要有坚强的毅力，高度的自觉，说到做到。活几年改造几年，改造不好，死不瞑目。（二）要以学习毛主席著作积极分子为榜样，狠学狠用“老三篇”。（三）要经风雨，见世面，在阶级斗争中，特别是在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪里去锻炼，改造提高，促进思想革命化。
    亮是前提，斗是关键，改是落实，这三步，缺一不可。毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。改造自己是艰苦的、长期的、痛苦的过程，必须横下一条心，刻苦学习，反复磨炼，脱胎换骨，处处按毛主席的教导办事，才能做一个毛主席的好战士。
