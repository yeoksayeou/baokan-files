Guangdong factory enterprises revolutionary factions jointly hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, thereby consolidating the revolutionary great alliance in thought. Eighty percent of the large and medium-sized factories in the city have achieved revolutionary great alliance and are promoting the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 5th - The working class of Guangzhou has resolutely responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. After establishing the Guangzhou Working Class Revolutionary Great Alliance Preparatory Committee, they have recently, with the support and help of the People's Liberation Army, launched a wave of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the city. Through these study classes, the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought have been firmly established among the workers. The workers have fought selfishness and criticized revisionism, transformed their worldviews, and further promoted and consolidated the revolutionary great alliance in thought, creating good conditions for the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

So far, more than 300 Mao Zedong Thought study classes of various forms have been established in factories and enterprises throughout the city, most of which are jointly organized by the original two or three factions. These jointly organized study classes have many advantages. They help to better fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, promote mutual understanding between the two factions, eliminate misunderstandings, and reduce differences; they help to overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and have a significant role in consolidating and advancing the revolutionary great alliance.

In these jointly organized study classes, the students listed the four major crimes of "selfishness" and petty-bourgeois factionalism: First, "selfishness" at the core, factionalism at play, unable to correctly understand the situation, often losing direction and going astray; second, "selfishness" at the core, factionalism at play, unable to correctly treat the masses, "only I am left," "only I am revolutionary," "only I am right," lacking proletarian feelings, unable to distinguish between enemies and friends, and unable to distinguish right from wrong; third, "selfishness" at the core, factionalism at play, unable to correctly treat cadres, not analyzing cadres class-wise, those who agree with and support one's own views are good cadres, those who disagree with and oppose one's own views are indiscriminately overthrown; fourth, "selfishness" at the core, factionalism at play, unable to correctly treat oneself, only able to revolutionize others, not oneself. By exposing the harm of "selfishness" and petty-bourgeois factionalism in this way, "selfishness" and factionalism were thoroughly criticized. In the process of exposing and fighting selfishness, everyone followed Chairman Mao's teachings, first examined their own shortcomings and mistakes, and did more self-criticism. Thus, the atmosphere became harmonious. The two factions found many common points and had a common language, thereby further consolidating the revolutionary great alliance in thought.

After the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, more and more units have achieved revolutionary great alliance. The knitting, instrument and meter, flashlight, water supply, chemical, metallurgy, textile, transportation, building materials, medicine, electrical machinery, and printing systems in the city have successively achieved full or partial system-wide revolutionary great alliance. A few systems that have not yet achieved great alliance are currently in the process of consultation and discussion. Eighty percent of the large and medium-sized factories in the city have achieved revolutionary great alliance. Systems and factories that have achieved great alliance have further achieved great alliance by department and by team after establishing study classes and are actively promoting the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. In units that have achieved revolutionary great alliance, revolutionary criticism and the unit's struggle-criticism-transformation are carried out relatively well. Currently, some units are conducting a thorough criticism of the revisionist line that China's Khrushchev and his agents have promoted in the Guangdong industrial front for the past seventeen years.

    广州工厂企业革命派联合举办毛泽东思想学习班
    斗私批修从思想上巩固革命大联合
    全市百分之八十大中型工厂实现了革命大联合，正在促进革命三结合的实现
    新华社广州五日电　广州市工人阶级坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，继成立了全市性的广州工人阶级革命大联合筹备委员会之后，最近又在中国人民解放军的支持和帮助下，在全市掀起了大办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮。通过大办学习班，在全市工人中大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，工人们斗私批修，改造世界观，从思想上进一步促进和巩固了革命的大联合，为实现革命的三结合创造了好条件。
    到目前为止，全市工厂、企业已办起各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班三百多个，其中，大部分都是由原两大派或三大组织联合举办的。这种联合办的学习班有很多好处，它有利于更好地斗私批修，通过学习促进两大派互相了解，消除隔阂，减少分歧；有利于克服小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，对于巩固和推进革命大联合有很大的作用。
    在这种联合举办的学习班上，学员们列出了“私”字和小资产阶级派性的四大罪状：一，“私”字当头，派性作怪，不能正确认识形势，往往迷失方向，走向邪路；二，“私”字当头，派性作怪，不能正确对待群众，“唯我独左”，“唯我独革”，“唯我独尊”，没有无产阶级感情，敌我不分，是非不明；三，“私”字当头，派性作怪，不能正确对待干部，对干部不作阶级分析，凡同意和支持自己观点的就是好干部，不同意和反对自己观点的就不分青红皂白，一律打倒；四，“私”字当头，派性作怪，不能正确对待自己，只能革别人的命，不能革自己的命。经过这样大摆“私”字和小资产阶级派性的危害，把“私”字和派性搞臭了。在亮私和斗私的过程中，大家又遵照毛主席的教导，首先检查自己的缺点和错误，多做自我批评。这样，空气融洽了。两派找到了许多共同点，有了共同语言，从而从思想上进一步巩固了革命的大联合。
    在大办毛泽东思想学习班之后，实现革命大联合的单位越来越多。全市针织、仪器仪表、电筒、自来水、化工、冶金、纺织、运输、建筑材料、医药、电机、印刷等系统，先后都实现了全面或局部的按系统的革命大联合。少数还没有实现大联合的系统，两大派也正在进行协商讨论。全市大型和中型的工厂，已有百分之八十实现了革命大联合。已经实现了大联合的系统和工厂，在大办学习班之后，又有一部分进一步实现了按部门、按班组的大联合，并且正在积极促进革命三结合的实现。凡是实现了革命大联合的单位，革命大批判和本单位斗批改都开展得比较好。目前，有些单位对中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人十七年来在广州工业战线上推行的修正主义路线，展开了大批判。
