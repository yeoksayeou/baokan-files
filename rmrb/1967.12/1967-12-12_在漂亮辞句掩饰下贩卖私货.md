Title: Selling Private Goods Under the Cover of Beautiful Words

In the big poisonous weed "Being a Good Party Member and Building a Good Party," the Chinese Khrushchev maliciously says: "Those party members who endure hardships first and enjoy benefits later are our good party members. Although in certain personal enjoyments they temporarily suffer a bit of a loss, they are, or will eventually be, trusted and respected by us all and by the masses." Under the cover of beautiful words, the Chinese Khrushchev obliquely advocates his philosophy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," a philosophy of selfishness and petty bourgeoisie.

The bourgeoisie exploiters believe that "if one does not act for oneself, one will be punished by heaven and earth," starting from "self" and ending with "self," everything for oneself. The so-called "experience" of the Chinese Khrushchev is that "suffering" is false and "enjoying" is true. The purpose of "temporarily suffering a bit of a loss" is to eventually gain the "trust" and "respect" of everyone and the masses. Isn't that so? "Suffering" is for the sake of "enjoying"; "suffering a small loss" is for the sake of gaining a "big advantage" — "trust" and "respect." The Chinese Khrushchev's "experience" in living is a blatant exposure of his personal ambition and the ugly soul of his bourgeois worldview, and it is also another blatant exposure of his hypocritical, two-faced nature as a bourgeois pseudo-revolutionary.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything should start from the interests of the people." We should take "public" as our starting point and destination, serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly, becoming a revolutionary screw that never rusts.

Comrade Lin Biao says: The new ideas of the proletariat can be summarized in one word, "public." All the old ideas of the exploiting classes can be summarized in one word, "private."

Whether to act for the "public" or for the "private" is a major issue of the two worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Eliminating the private and establishing the public is a class struggle in the ideological realm between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. We must engage in self-criticism and criticize revisionism. Only by fighting against the "private" can we establish the "public" and effectively criticize revisionism. At the same time, we must combine self-criticism with the struggle against revisionism in the struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev's poison, allowing the "public" to fully occupy the territory in our minds.

　　在漂亮辞句掩饰下贩卖私货

    中国赫鲁晓夫在《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》的大毒草中胡说：“那些吃苦在前，享福在后的党员，是我们的好党员，虽然在某些个人享受上，他们暂时吃一点亏，然而他们是，或者最后是，为我们大家及群众所信任，所尊敬的”。在漂亮辞句的掩饰下，中国赫鲁晓夫转弯抹角地宣扬他“吃小亏，占大便宜”的利己主义市侩哲学。
    资产阶级剥削者认为“人不为己，天诛地灭”，他们是从“私”字出发，又以“私”字为归宿，一切为了自己。中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓做人“经验”，“吃苦”是假，“享福”是真。“暂时吃一点亏”的目的，是最后得到大家及群众的“信任”和“尊敬”。不是吗？“吃苦”是为了“享福”；“吃小亏”是为了得到“大便宜”——“信任”和“尊敬”。中国赫鲁晓夫的这个做人“经验”，是他个人野心家的丑恶灵魂和资产阶级世界观的大暴露，也是他的资产阶级伪君子两面派嘴脸的又一次大暴露。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切从人民的利益出发”。我们要以“公”字作为出发点和归宿点，“完全”“彻底”地全心全意地为人民服务，做一个永远不生锈的“革命的螺丝钉”。
    林彪同志说：无产阶级的新思想，可以概括到一个“公”字上，一切剥削阶级的旧思想，可以概括到一个“私”字上。
    为“公”还是为“私”是无产阶级和资产阶级两种世界观的大问题，破私立公，是思想领域里无产阶级对资产阶级进行的阶级斗争。我们一定要斗私批修，只有狠斗“私”字，才能树立“公”字，才能很好地批修；同时，又要在批修斗争中，结合斗私，消除中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，让“公”字在自己的头脑里全部占领阵地。
