Editors' Note by *People's Daily* and *Liberation Army Daily*: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the Beijing Knitting Factory is a model of our great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and strategic deployment.

The 8341st Unit of the People's Liberation Army, which is supporting the leftist movement in this factory, is a red flag in the support-left work.

We should learn from the support-left comrades of the 8341st Unit and the revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, with an unyielding class sentiment for our great leader Chairman Mao, implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: A joint reporting team from the capital's news agencies reported from the Beijing Knitting Factory: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the Beijing Knitting Factory is a model of our great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and strategic deployment. The support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed at this factory have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, persistently and vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, grasped ideological and political work, firmly believed in the masses, relied on the masses, and implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of this factory have studied Chairman Mao's works very seriously and executed Chairman Mao's instructions very resolutely. After the important instructions given by Chairman Mao during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China were conveyed, the entire factory quickly achieved revolutionary unity, established a revolutionary committee, and launched a mass revolutionary criticism, struggle, and reform.

Persistently Propagate Mao Zedong Thought

Firmly Believe in and Rely on the Masses

After the support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit entered the factory on June 26th, they followed the consistent teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and adhered to the following principles in their support-left work:

Vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and do thorough, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work.

Do not rush to take a stand, conduct investigations and research, and if both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, gradually unite them.

Learn from the worker masses, do not be afraid of making mistakes, and correct them if they are wrong. Care for the masses' lives.

They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "grasping ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles" and grasped the fundamental task of support-left work, which is to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establish the absolute authority of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Support-left personnel are propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. During the support-left process, there are countless details and ever-changing situations, but grasping the study and application of Chairman Mao's works is grasping the essence. They firmly believed in the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly believed that the broad masses listen to Chairman Mao the most. No matter how many difficulties they encountered or how big the problems were, they persistently propagated Mao Zedong Thought and guided the masses to solve problems according to Chairman Mao's teachings. They conveyed Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the battle cries of the proletarian headquarters to the broad masses with the greatest enthusiasm, quickly and deeply, and without any compromise. They organized the broad revolutionary workers to take "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, combine thought with the reality of class struggle, and study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They did thorough, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work, sending Mao Zedong Thought to the workshops, dormitories, and hearts of the broad workers and their families.

Under the help of the support-left troops, the entire factory further launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They actively arranged the learning environment, created a learning atmosphere, established and improved daily reading systems, organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, and held Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Workers stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait before work, studied Chairman Mao's quotations, reported to Chairman Mao, reported to Chairman Mao after work, saw Chairman Mao's quotation boards whenever they looked up during production, exchanged Chairman Mao's quotations during shift changes, and guided their actions with Chairman Mao's teachings at all times. The broad revolutionary workers studied and applied the "Old Three Articles" thoroughly, transformed their worldviews, and sparked a revolution in their souls. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's works and latest instructions, deeply understood and mastered Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, methods, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Workers sang, "The factory has become a grand classroom of Mao Zedong Thought, and a red sun that never sets has risen in our hearts!"

"The organization of tens of millions of people and the mobilization of a surging revolutionary army are the needs of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." The support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit followed Chairman Mao's teaching and, upon entering the factory, paid great attention to promoting revolutionary unity and guiding the broad revolutionary workers to unite against the enemy. They believed that all revolutionary mass organizations would act according to Mao Zedong Thought, and as long as ideological and political work was done well, they could gradually unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

When they entered the factory, the two major factions in the factory were in sharp conflict and engaged in internal strife. They did not rush to take a stand but first conducted thorough investigations and research. They learned that both factions were revolutionary mass organizations, and their revolutionary struggle was in the same direction, but there were differences on some specific issues. They insisted on the principle of "supporting the left without supporting any faction." Regardless of which faction's actions were in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, they firmly supported them; if not, they did not support them and patiently guided the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and correct them consciously. Although many people said they were "mixing things up," they insisted on acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, did not support one side while suppressing the other, and avoided further conflict between the two factions.

To gradually unite the two factions, on the one hand, they did ideological and political work with the leaders of the two factions, and on the other hand, they propagated Chairman Mao's teachings on revolutionary unity to the broad masses of the two factions, letting Mao Zedong Thought directly meet the masses and be mastered by them. In this way, both leaders and masses could be guided. They organized all members of the two factions to repeatedly study "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the "Sixteen Points," guiding everyone to distinguish between friends and enemies, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, unite themselves, and attack the enemy, directing their hatred towards the handful of capitalist roaders in the party represented by Liu Shaoqi. They also organized the masses of the two factions to study Chairman Mao's works together, hold revolutionary big criticism meetings together, recall bitterness and think of sweetness together, and study production problems together, gradually eliminating the antagonistic sentiments between the two sides and creating good conditions for achieving revolutionary unity.

After achieving revolutionary unity in the entire factory by workshop, class, and department, they organized the original members of the two factions to take turns participating in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. At the same time, they emphasized the advantages of revolutionary unity throughout the factory, exposed the crimes of factionalism, denounced bourgeois factionalism, enhanced proletarian party spirit, and consolidated revolutionary unity from the ideological level. Workers who originally thought that the support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit were "mixing things up" now say: Our support-left troops support the left without supporting any faction, with clear banners and firm positions, truly implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and truly supporting the broad leftist masses.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "Communist Party members should also become models of learning. They are teachers of the people every day, but they are also students of the people every day." The support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit realized that the support-left troops should correctly handle their relationship with the masses and their position among the masses, which is a fundamental attitude and a major issue of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They said: "The working class is our natural teacher. We are forever students who will never graduate in front of the revolutionary masses." They did not stand above the masses but immersed themselves among the masses, learning, working, and struggling against selfishness and repudiating revisionism with the worker masses, seriously learning the noble qualities of the working class. They were not supervisors of the masses but consultants, mobilizing the masses to do a good job in revolution and production under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. They often broadly solicited the masses' opinions, actively sought out those who had opinions about them for heart-to-heart talks, listened to criticisms. They also actively became fighters in the struggle against selfishness and repudiation of revisionism, striving to promote their own ideological transformation. In work, they were not afraid of making mistakes, and if they were wrong, they would frankly admit their mistakes to the masses and correct them immediately.

The support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit, following Chairman Mao's teachings, paid attention to caring for the masses' lives. They often visited workers' families during holidays, bringing revolutionary warmth and great Mao Zedong Thought to the workers and their families. The broad revolutionary masses unanimously praised them: "They are truly good soldiers sent by Chairman Mao!" In this way, they not only became one with the masses, strengthened the relationship between the military and the people, but also raised the ideological awareness of the broad workers and their families, powerfully promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the factory.

Follow Chairman Mao's Deployment Step by Step

Implement Chairman Mao's Instructions Word for Word

Under the help of the support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit, the broad revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, who love Chairman Mao dearly, eliminated various interferences and followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Whatever Chairman Mao said, they did it. They followed Chairman Mao's strategic deployment step by step and implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions word for word.

On September 14th, the newspaper published Chairman Mao's great instruction: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The two major revolutionary organizations and the broad revolutionary workers in the factory took action immediately, set aside specific disputes, and achieved revolutionary unity by workshop, class, and department under revolutionary principles on September 19th. Subsequently, the two factions reached a consensus through full consultation and established the leading body of the revolutionary unity of the entire factory—the Revolutionary Unity Committee of the Revolutionary Masses.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism," they immediately took action, taking "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely struggle against the "self" in their minds, and fiercely criticize Liu Shaoqi's capitalist reactionary line. The original leaders of the two factions strictly demanded of themselves and bravely made self-criticisms. They not only struggled against factionalism within the Revolutionary Unity Committee but also exposed their selfishness and struggled against it at the entire factory's workers' meeting. They laid bare their selfishness and exposed their factionalism. Through struggling against selfishness, they deepened their friendship, strengthened their unity, and denounced bourgeois factionalism. The entire factory presented a great situation of "leaders leading the way to remove barriers, and the masses rising up to level the ground." Both sides eliminated their estrangement and further consolidated revolutionary unity from the ideological level.

After Chairman Mao's latest instructions on correctly handling cadres were issued, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Beijing Knitting Factory, under the help of the support-left troops, actively took measures to educate cadres and liberate cadres. They did a lot of ideological and political work, helping cadres who had made mistakes to correctly handle their relationship with the masses, correctly handle themselves, draw a clear line between themselves and the capitalist roaders and the bourgeois reactionary line, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. On this basis, the "three-in-one combination" factory revolutionary committee was established on November 11th.

The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the Beijing Knitting Factory, and the entire factory presented a prosperous new situation. The workers' spiritual outlook was completely renewed. The revolution was carried out vigorously, and production was carried out enthusiastically. Combining the criticism of Liu Shaoqi and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique's implementation of the revisionist line of managing enterprises, the struggle, criticism, and reform in this unit were launched. The entire factory's production continued to rise, and the production plan was completed well. Many workshops and classes created new production records since the factory was established, and a new situation of production leaps and bounds has emerged. (Accompanying photo)

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Factory, with their boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, hung Chairman Mao's portrait neatly on every machine. Before work every day, they stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, studied Chairman Mao's quotations, reported to Chairman Mao, and after work, they reported to Chairman Mao. During production, they saw Chairman Mao's quotation boards whenever they looked up, exchanged Chairman Mao's quotations during shift changes, and guided their actions with Chairman Mao's teachings at all times.

    我们要向八三四一部队支左同志和北京针织总厂的革命职工学习，以无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    新华社十六日讯　首都新闻单位驻北京针织总厂联合记者组报道：北京针织总厂的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是体现我们伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和战略部署的一个典范。驻这个厂的人民解放军八三四一部队支左人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持不懈地大力宣传毛泽东思想，狠抓思想政治工作，坚定不移地相信群众，依靠群众，贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这个厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，学习毛主席著作非常认真，执行毛主席的指示非常坚决。毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的重要指示传达以后，全厂迅速地实现了革命的大联合，成立了革命委员会，展开了群众性的革命的大批判和斗批改。
    坚持不懈地宣传毛泽东思想
    坚定不移地相信和依靠群众
    八三四一部队支左人员在六月二十六日进厂以后，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的一贯教导，在支左工作中坚决贯彻执行以下原则：
    大力宣传毛泽东思想，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作。
    不匆匆忙忙急于表态，经过调查研究，如果两派都是革命的群众组织，就逐步地把他们联合起来。
    向工人群众学习，不怕犯错误，错了就改。关心群众的生活。
    他们牢记毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，在支左工作中狠抓根本不转向。他们认为：支左工作的根本任务，就是用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑，大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威。支左人员，就是毛泽东思想的宣传员。支左过程中，事情千头万绪，情况千变万化，抓住活学活用毛主席著作这一条就抓住了根本。他们坚信毛泽东思想的无比威力，坚信广大群众最听毛主席的话，不管碰到多少困难，不管出现多大的问题，都坚定不移地宣传毛泽东思想，引导群众按照毛主席的教导去解决问题。他们用最大的热情，又快又深地、不折不扣地把毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的战斗号令，传达到广大群众中去。他们组织广大革命职工以“斗私，批修”为纲，联系思想，联系阶级斗争的实际，活学活用毛主席著作。他们进行了深入、细致、艰苦的思想政治工作，把毛泽东思想送到车间，送到宿舍，送到广大职工及其家属的心坎上。
    全厂广大革命职工在支左部队帮助下，进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他们积极布置学习环境，大造学习声势，建立和健全天天读等学习制度，组织毛泽东思想宣传队，举办毛泽东思想学习班。职工们上班前站在毛主席像前，学习毛主席语录，向毛主席请示，下班后向毛主席汇报，生产中抬头便见毛主席语录牌，交班时交毛主席语录，随时随地用毛主席的教导指导自己的行动。广大革命职工大学大用“老三篇”，改造世界观，在灵魂深处爆发革命。他们认真学习毛主席著作和最新指示，深刻理解和掌握毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。工人们歌唱道：“工厂变成了毛泽东思想大课堂，心中升起了永远不落的红太阳！”
      “组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”八三四一部队支左人员，遵循毛主席的这一教导，一进厂就十分重视促进革命的大联合，引导广大革命职工团结对敌。他们坚信：各派革命的群众组织，都是要按照毛泽东思想办事的，只要做好思想政治工作，他们便可以在毛泽东思想的基础上，逐步地联合起来。
    他们进厂的时候，厂里两大派群众组织尖锐对立，“内战”不休。他们没有匆匆忙忙急于表态，而是首先进行深入的调查研究。他们了解到两派都是革命的群众组织，革命斗争大方向是一致的，只是在某些具体问题上有分歧，便坚持实行“支左不支派”的原则。不论是那派组织的言行，凡是符合毛泽东思想的、符合毛主席的伟大战略部署的，他们都坚决支持；凡是不符合的，都不支持，而且耐心地引导群众活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地加以改正。尽管当时有不少人说他们是“和稀泥”，他们仍然坚持按毛泽东思想办事，不支持一方压制另一方，避免了造成两派组织之间更加对立。
    为了促使两派组织逐步地联合起来，他们一方面对两派组织的负责人做思想政治工作，一方面向两派广大群众宣传毛主席有关革命大联合的教导，让毛泽东思想直接和群众见面，为广大群众所掌握。这样，既可以由头头带群众，又可以由群众促头头。他们组织两派所有成员反复学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和“十六条”，引导大家分清敌友，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，团结自己，打击敌人，把仇恨集中到以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮走资派身上。他们还组织两派群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起开革命大批判会，一起忆苦思甜，一起研究生产问题，使双方逐步消除对立情绪，为实现革命大联合创造了良好条件。
    在全厂按车间、班组、科室实现革命大联合以后，他们又组织原来两派成员轮流参加毛泽东思想学习班。同时，在全厂大讲革命大联合的好处，大摆派性的罪状，搞臭小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，从思想上巩固了革命的大联合。原来认为八三四一部队支左人员“和稀泥”的职工，现在都说：我们厂的支左部队支左不支派，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，真正贯彻了毛主席的革命路线，真正支持了左派广大群众。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“共产党员又应成为学习的模范，他们每天都是民众的教师，但又每天都是民众的学生。”八三四一部队支左人员认识到，支左部队摆正自己同群众的关系，摆正自己同群众的位置，是一个根本态度问题，是一个贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大问题。他们说：“工人阶级是我们天然的老师。我们在革命群众面前，是永远毕不了业的小学生。”他们不是高踞于群众之上，而是深入于群众之中，同工人群众一起学习，一起劳动，一起斗私批修，认真学习工人阶级的高贵品质。他们不是当群众的上司，而是当群众的参谋，放手发动群众，在毛泽东思想指引下，搞好革命和生产。他们经常广泛征求群众意见，主动找那些对自己有意见的群众交心谈心，听取批评。他们还积极当斗私批修的战斗员，努力促进自己的思想革命化。在工作中不怕犯错误，错了就实事求是地公开向群众承认错误，并且立即改正。
    八三四一部队支左人员，根据毛主席的教导，注意关心群众的生活。他们经常利用节假日，走访职工家庭，给职工及其家属送去革命的温暖，送去伟大的毛泽东思想。广大革命群众齐声赞扬他们：“真不愧是毛主席派来的好战士！”这样，不仅和群众打成一片，密切了军民之间的关系，而且提高了广大职工及其家属的思想觉悟，有力地推动了工厂的无产阶级文化大革命。
    毛主席的部署步步紧跟
    毛主席的指示句句照办
    在八三四一部队支左人员的帮助下，无限热爱毛主席的北京针织总厂广大革命职工，排除了各种干扰，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。毛主席的战略部署，他们步步紧跟；毛主席的最新指示，他们句句照办。
    九月十四日，报上发表了毛主席的伟大指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”厂内两大派革命组织和广大革命职工，闻风而动，放下具体问题的争论，在革命的原则下，于九月十九日就按车间、班组、科室实现了革命的大联合。随后，两派经过充分协商，成立了全厂革命大联合的领导班子——无产阶级革命派大联合委员会。
    毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以后，他们又立即行动起来，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，狠斗头脑中的“私”字，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线。原两派组织的负责人都严格要求自己，勇于作自我批评。他们不仅在大联合委员会内狠斗派性，而且到全厂职工大会上亮私、斗私。他们把私心公诸于众，把派性和盘托出。通过斗私，增进了友谊，加强了团结，搞臭了小资产阶级派性。全厂出现了“头头带头搬山头，群众群起平山头”的大好形势。双方消除了隔阂，进一步从思想上巩固了革命的大联合。
    毛主席关于正确地对待干部的最新指示一发表，北京针织总厂的无产阶级革命派就在支左部队的帮助下，积极采取措施，教育干部，解放干部。他们做了大量的思想政治工作，帮助犯有错误的干部正确地对待群众，正确地对待自己，同走资派、同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。在这个基础上，十一月十一日成立了“三结合”的厂革命委员会。
    毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了北京针织总厂，全厂呈现一派欣欣向荣的新气象。职工的精神面貌焕然一新。革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产搞得热火朝天。结合批判中国赫鲁晓夫和彭真反革命修正主义集团推行的修正主义办企业的路线，本单位的斗批改开展起来了。全厂生产节节上升，生产计划完成得很好。不少车间、班组创造了建厂以来的生产新纪录，一个生产跃进的新局面已经显露出来。（附图片）
    北京针织总厂革命职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的感情，在每个车床上端端正正地挂上毛主席像，每天上班前站在毛主席像前，学习毛主席语录，向毛主席请示，下班后向毛主席汇报。　首都新闻单位驻北京针织总厂联合记者组摄（新华社发）
