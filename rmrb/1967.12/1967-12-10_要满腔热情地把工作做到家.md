During the process of revolutionary criticism in our municipal committee, a large number of revolutionary cadres were liberated, and many of them participated in the leadership of the municipal revolutionary committee. However, there are still some cadres who are neither defeated nor have come forward and have not been liberated. The reasons for these cadres not being liberated promptly are many, but from our perspective as revolutionaries, the main issue is that we have not thoroughly understood and firmly implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling the cadre issue. Some people think that having a few revolutionary cadres participate in the revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs is enough, and that other cadres can wait; some say, "It's not that we don't want to liberate cadres, but they themselves are not up to the task." In response to these thoughts, we organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the cadre issue.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling the cadre issue is the key to implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating the revolutionary great alliance, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. This issue must be resolved." After studying Chairman Mao's teachings, we realized that revolutionary cadres are a precious asset of the party, and liberating revolutionary cadres is an urgent need for the revolutionary cause. The lack of urgency in liberating cadres is mainly due to the influence of selfishness. The idea that "we can manage without cadres" stems from our own pride and complacency after rebelling for over a year.

Through studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the cadre issue, we also realized that some cadres do not come forward, and we cannot simply blame them for not being proactive. Our work not being thorough also has a significant role to play. Therefore, we carefully analyzed the reasons why some cadres cannot stand up: these cadres made mistakes mainly because they lacked ideological preparation for the socialist revolution and had a weak sense of class struggle and line struggle; additionally, their positions grew larger, their attitudes became more arrogant, and their distance from the masses increased. To solve such problems, we cannot let them stand aside; we must let them go among the masses, where they can be inspired by the living class struggle to enhance their sense of class and line struggle awareness, thereby understanding the significance of the Cultural Revolution and seeing that their mistakes are not just isolated incidents but are part of the larger struggle between the two lines. Only then will it be effective. Therefore, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, we started from education, on one hand, letting cadres participate in the current struggle, and on the other hand, organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes to systematically invite cadres to participate in criticizing and repudiating revisionism.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, we organized cadres to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, using Chairman Mao's warm teachings to inspire everyone's boundless love, loyalty, admiration, and faith in Chairman Mao. We also invited poor and lower-middle peasants to share their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, organized cadres to participate in revolutionary criticism with revolutionary cadres and revolutionary youngsters, and let them analyze and understand the great situation and historical significance of the Cultural Revolution, inspiring everyone to bravely shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the Chinese and world revolutions. On this basis, we organized them to deeply study and apply "Old Three Articles," to ignite a revolution in their souls, to fiercely struggle against selfishness, to uproot the "revisionist" roots, to put down various ideological burdens, and to fundamentally raise their class consciousness. Many cadres came in with ideological burdens and left with Mao Zedong Thought. Currently, some cadres have already participated in the leading bodies of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units.

    要满腔热情地把工作做到家
    上海市委机关革命造反联络站勤务组　凌岩
    我们市委机关在革命大批判过程中解放了大批革命干部，其中的不少同志参加了市革命委员会的领导工作。但还有一些既打不倒、又没有站出来的干部没有解放。这些干部迟迟不能解放，原因当然很多，仅就我们革命派来看，主要是对毛主席关于正确对待干部问题的指示没有认真领会、没有坚决执行。有的人认为，有几个革命干部参加革命三结合临时权力机构就行了，其他干部可以慢慢来，没有他们，我们照样干；有的说：“不是我们不解放干部，是他们自己不争气。”针对这些活思想，我们举办了毛泽东思想学习班，反复学习毛主席关于干部问题的教导。
    毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”学习了毛主席的教导，我们认识到革命干部是党的宝贵财富，解放革命干部，是革命事业的迫切需要。对解放干部问题感到不迫切，主要是“私”字在作怪。“没有干部照样干”的想法，是自己造了一年多的反，以为了不起，骄傲自满了。
    通过学习毛主席关于干部问题的教导，我们还认识到，有些干部站不出来，不能只怪干部不争气，我们的工作没有做到家也有很大关系。于是，我们认真分析了一些干部站不起来的原因：这些干部所以犯错误，主要是对社会主义革命缺乏思想准备，对阶级斗争、路线斗争的观念淡薄了；加上官做大了，架子大了，和群众距离远了。解决这样的问题，不能让他们靠边站，只有让他们到群众里面去，在活生生的阶级斗争中激发阶级感情，提高路线斗争的觉悟，从而认识无产阶级文化大革命的意义，看到自己所犯的错误不是一时一事的问题，而是在两条路线斗争中站错了队的大问题。这样，才会有效果。因此，我们按照毛主席的教导，从教育着手，一方面让干部参加当前的斗争，另一方面开办毛泽东思想学习班，有计划地吸收干部参加斗私批修。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，我们组织干部学习毛主席的最新指示，以毛主席的亲切教诲，来激发大家对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限崇拜、无限信仰的感情。我们还请了贫农、下中农介绍活学活用毛主席著作的体会，组织干部和机关革命派以及革命小将一起参加革命大批判，并让他们分析和认识无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势和伟大的历史意义，激励大家勇挑中国革命和世界革命的重担。在这个基础上，组织他们大学大用“老三篇”，在灵魂深处爆发革命，狠斗私心，铲除“修”根，放下种种思想包袱，从根本上提高阶级觉悟。许多干部背着思想包袱进来，带着毛泽东思想回去。目前，有的干部已经参加了各单位斗批改的领导班子。
