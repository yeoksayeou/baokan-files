The revolutionary workers of the Fengfeng mining area in Hebei Province have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." They have organized extensive study classes on Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly studying and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles." This has greatly promoted the revolution and production across the entire mining area. The raw coal production and excavation progress in the entire mining area have continued to rise. In November, mines such as Hongwei, Fanxiu, and Lixin all overfulfilled the state plan, and some shafts even completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. Since December, the revolutionary and production situation in this mining area has become even better.

    河北省峰峰矿区广大革命职工，坚决响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，大办毛泽东思想学习班，大学大用毛主席的一系列最新指示和“老三篇”，极大地推动了全矿区的革命和生产。全矿区的原煤产量和掘进进尺不断上升，十一月份红卫、反修、立新等矿都超额完成了国家计划，有的坑口还提前完成了全年计划。十二月份以来，这个矿区的革命和生产形势更好。
