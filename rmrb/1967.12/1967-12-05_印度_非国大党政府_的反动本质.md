The reactionary nature of India's "Non-Congress Governments"

The Indian reactionaries and their accomplices, the Danji clique and the Indian revisionist communists, are using the so-called "Non-Congress Governments" to deceive the people. However, the outbreak of the armed peasant revolution in Naxalbari has exposed the true colors of the "Non-Congress Governments" led by the Indian revisionist communists. The Indian Congress Party's reactionary government dissolved the "Non-Congress Government" in West Bengal, completely exposing the fraud of the so-called "Non-Congress Governments."

The current "Non-Congress Governments" emerged after India's "Fourth General Election" this year. The background of this "election" is that the Indian Congress Party, the main tool of the Indian big landlords and bourgeoisie, is in a difficult situation both domestically and internationally. The Congress Party's 20-year rule has fully exposed its reactionary and sellout nature to the Indian people. The Indian reactionaries and their backers, the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, have long felt that their control of India's national power through the Congress Party is becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, in the states where the Congress Party's influence has significantly weakened, they have supported the Liberal Party, People's Alliance, and other reactionary parties, as well as feudal princes and reactionary politicians, to form "Non-Congress Governments," creating the illusion of a multi-party coalition government to maintain reactionary rule. In areas with high levels of mass movements, the Indian reactionaries particularly need to use the deceptive nature of the Indian revisionist communists to serve them. Before the election, the Indian reactionary government released some Indian revisionist communists from prison, allowing them to participate in the election and become members of parliament and ministers. The Indian revisionist communists also sought positions in the "Non-Congress Governments" to prove that "peaceful transition" is possible.

Thus, after the "election," the Congress Party still controls the central government, while in 16 states of India (excluding the Indian-occupied Kashmir region), 9 states have established "Non-Congress Governments." Among them, the governments of Kerala and West Bengal are composed of Indian revisionist communists, the traitorous Danji clique, and other reactionary parties. The governments of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Orissa, and Haryana are composed of reactionary politicians who have left the Congress Party, as well as the Indian People's Alliance, Liberal Party, and United Socialist Party.

After these "Non-Congress Government" officials took office, they pretended to care about the people's lives and put forward some deceptive slogans to win hearts and minds. They tried to make the people believe that the "Non-Congress Governments" are fundamentally different from the Congress Party governments.

However, the ironclad facts have exposed these lies. The parties and politicians organizing the "Non-Congress Governments" all represent the interests of the Indian big landlords and bourgeoisie. The People's Alliance and the Liberal Party openly advocate in their platforms the development of "free enterprise (i.e., the arbitrary development of monopoly capital)" and anti-China, anti-communist, and alliance with U.S. imperialism. The former Chief Minister of West Bengal, A. Mukherjee, was praised by the Indian revisionist communists as a "leftist," but in reality, he is a 44-year veteran of the Congress Party who was the state Congress Party chairman just three years ago. He recently left the Congress Party only to seize power. The Chief Minister of Bihar was also the state Congress Party chairman and later left the Congress Party. The Chief Minister of Orissa is a local feudal prince.

These state governments, like the Congress Party government, are vigorously maintaining and developing the interests of monopoly capital and landlords. When the Indian revisionist communists were in power in Kerala in 1957, they even implemented a fake "land reform law." Now, they no longer even mention slogans like land reform. They are busy inviting domestic and foreign tycoons to set up factories and mines in Kerala, ruthlessly exploiting the people.

These state governments, like the Congress Party government, are bloody butchers of revolutionary workers and peasants. The "Non-Congress Government" of West Bengal once sent more than 1,500 armed police to Darjeeling District to brutally suppress the armed struggle of local peasants, arresting more than 900 rebel peasants. When there was a "Naxalbari-style" peasant struggle in Kerala, the Chief Minister of the state, the Indian revisionist Nambudiripad, immediately sent police forces to suppress it.

Now, the deceptive role of the Congress Party government has failed, and the "Non-Congress Governments" have also completely collapsed. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Indian revolutionary communists are leading the peasants in Naxalbari and other regions to wage revolutionary armed struggles, which is an important sign of the awakening of the Indian people.

### 印度“非国大党政府”的反动本质

    印度“非国大党政府”的反动本质
    印度反动派及其帮凶丹吉集团和印共修正主义分子，利用所谓“非国大党政府”，极力欺骗人民。但是，纳萨尔巴里农民武装革命的爆发，使印共修正主义分子主持的“非国大党政府”彻底现了原形。印度国大党反动政府解散西孟加拉邦的“非国大党政府”，使所谓“非国大党政府”的这个大骗局，彻底破产了。
    目前存在的“非国大党政府”，是今年二月印度“第四届大选”之后出现的。这次“大选”的背景是，印度大地主大资产阶级的主要工具国大党处于内外交困的境地。国大党二十年来的统治，在印度人民中充分暴露了它的反动卖国的面目。印度反动派和它的后台老板美帝苏修，早已感觉到，它们利用国大党一党控制印度全国政权的局面已经非常困难。因此，在国大党势力大大削弱的邦，它们就扶植自由党、人民同盟等反动政党以及封建土王、反动政客等等，出来组成“非国大党政府”，制造多党联合执政的“民主”假象，以维持反动统治。在群众运动高涨的地区，印度反动派特别需要利用印共修正主义分子的欺骗性来为他们效劳。在大选以前，印度反动政府就从监狱里把一些印共修正主义分子放出来，让他们参加竞选，让他们当上议员和部长。印共修正主义分子，也需要在“非国大党政府”中捞得一官半职，妄图用这一点来证明“和平过渡”是可能的。
    这样，在“大选”以后，国大党仍然控制着中央政府，同时，在印度的十六个邦（不包括克什米尔印度占领区）中，有九个邦成立了“非国大党政府”。其中喀拉拉邦和西孟加拉邦政府，是由印共修正主义分子、叛徒丹吉集团和其它反动政党联合组成的；比哈尔、北方、旁遮普、奥里萨、哈里亚纳五个邦，是由脱离国大党的反动政客以及印度人民同盟、自由党、统一社会党等反动政党联合执政的。
    这些“非国大党政府”的官员粉墨登台以后，装出一副关心人民生活的姿态，提出一些欺骗性的口号来笼络人心。他们企图使人民相信，“非国大党政府”同国大党政府是根本不同的。
    但是，铁的事实揭穿了这种谎言。组织“非国大党政府”的政党和政客，全都代表印度大地主大资产阶级的利益。人民同盟和自由党在它的纲领中，公然写上发展“自由企业（即任意发展垄断资本）”和反华、反共、同美帝结盟的主张。前西孟加拉邦的首席部长阿·慕克吉，被印共修正主义分子吹捧为“左派人士”，实际上是一个有四十四年党龄的国大党人，三年前还是邦国大党主席。他不久以前退出国大党，只不过是为了争权夺利。比哈尔邦的首席部长也是当过那个邦国大党主席、后来退出国大党的。奥里萨邦的首席部长是当地的一个土王。
    这些邦政府同国大党政府一样，竭力维护和发展垄断资本和地主的利益。印共修正主义分子一九五七年在喀拉拉邦当政时，还搞过一个假的“土地改革法”。现在，连土地改革等口号他们也不再提了。他们正忙着邀请本国的和外国的大财阀到喀拉拉邦设厂开矿，残酷地压榨人民。
    这些邦政府同国大党政府一样，是血腥地镇压革命工人、农民的刽子手。西孟加拉邦“非国大党政府”曾经派了一千五百多名武装警察到大吉岭县去血腥镇压当地农民的武装斗争，逮捕了九百多名起义农民。喀拉拉邦一出现“纳萨尔巴里式”的农民斗争，邦首席部长、印修分子南布迪里巴德立即派警察部队去镇压。
    现在，国大党政府的欺骗作用失灵了，“非国大党政府”也宣告彻底破产了。印共革命派在毛泽东思想的指引下，领导纳萨尔巴里和其它地区的农民开展革命武装斗争，就是印度人民觉醒的重要标志。
