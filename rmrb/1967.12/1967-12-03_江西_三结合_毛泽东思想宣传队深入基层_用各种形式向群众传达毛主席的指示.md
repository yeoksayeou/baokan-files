To ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions reach the masses as quickly and timely as possible, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group formed a "three-in-one" Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team in mid-September. The team went to various grassroots units to convey and implement the instructions, sparking a wave of active learning and application of Chairman Mao's latest instructions across the province.

This propaganda team, composed of revolutionary cadres from the proletariat, revolutionary leaders, and support-left troops, immediately began using big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, propaganda columns, and broadcasts upon arriving at the grassroots level. They utilized various venues such as fields, streets, markets, large and small meetings to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They studied relevant documents on the Cultural Revolution with the broad revolutionary masses, propagandized the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and explained the struggles between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. The masses in various places directly heard the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, and were all elated and inspired. They said, "Chairman Mao's instructions are like a lighthouse illuminating our path forward. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words to the letter." Many masses who were previously deceived, with tears of joy, excitedly said, "Thank you to the propaganda team comrades for bringing us Chairman Mao's voice. We now see clearly. Previously, information was blocked here, and we rarely heard Chairman Mao's voice. What we heard was mostly the nonsense of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and some bad elements, making us more and more confused." The deceived masses, after hearing Chairman Mao's voice, raised their consciousness, and exposed the tricks of a handful of capitalist-roaders and bad leaders within the party, quickly returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

To solve the cadre issue, the propaganda team, upon arriving in each county, commune, and production brigade, propagandized Chairman Mao's cadre policy together with the local proletarian revolutionary cadres. They severely criticized the reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small group" advocated by Liu Shaoqi (referred to as "Chinese Khrushchev"). They studied Chairman Mao's works with the cadres, sharing their learning experiences. With the help of the broad proletarian revolutionary cadres and the propaganda team, a group of revolutionary leading cadres, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, came forward to participate in the "three-in-one" leading cadre group. Currently, under the promotion of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, the broad revolutionary masses across the province have launched a wave of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

    江西“三结合”毛泽东思想宣传队深入基层
    用各种形式向群众传达毛主席的指示
    本报讯　为了最迅速、最及时地让毛主席的最新指示和广大群众直接见面，江西省革命委员会筹备小组于九月中旬组成了“三结合”的毛泽东思想宣传队，前往各地基层单位进行传达和贯彻，在全省掀起活学活用毛主席最新指示的高潮。
    这支由无产阶级革命派、革命的领导干部和支左部队组成的“三结合”毛泽东思想宣传队一到基层，他们就用大字报、黑板报、宣传栏和广播等各种宣传工具，利用田间地头、街道集市、大会小会等各种场合，宣传毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的最新指示。他们和广大革命群众一起学习文化大革命的有关文件，向广大群众宣传无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，讲解两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。各地广大群众从他们口里直接听到伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，无不欢欣鼓舞。他们说：“毛主席的指示象灯塔一样照亮了我们前进的道路。毛主席的话我们一定句句照办，字字照办。”许多过去受蒙蔽的群众含着热泪激动地说：“感谢宣传队的同志给我们带来了毛主席的声音，我们听了心明眼亮。过去我们这里封锁消息，很少听到毛主席的声音，听到的尽是党内一小撮走资派和一些坏家伙的胡说八道，弄得我们越听越糊涂。”受蒙蔽的群众听了毛主席的声音，提高了觉悟，纷纷揭露党内一小撮走资派和一小撮坏头头的阴谋诡计，很快地回到了毛主席的革命路线上来。
    为了解决干部问题，宣传队每到一个县、公社、大队，就同当地的无产阶级革命派一起宣传毛主席的干部政策，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。他们和干部一起学习毛主席著作，互相交谈学习心得体会。在广大无产阶级革命派和宣传队的帮助下，一批革命的领导干部通过斗私批修，站出来参加了“三结合”的领导班子。当前，全省在毛泽东思想宣传队的促进下，广大革命群众掀起了活学活用毛主席最新指示的高潮。
