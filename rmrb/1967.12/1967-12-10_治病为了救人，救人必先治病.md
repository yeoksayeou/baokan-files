	Editor's Note: Correctly handling cadres who have made mistakes is an important issue in the current movement that must be resolved. The several articles published here can provide some inspiration.

	In dealing with cadres who have made mistakes, we must adopt a serious, active, and enthusiastic policy to help them recognize and correct their mistakes.

	Some cadres, in the struggle between the two lines, took the wrong side and carried out the bourgeois reactionary line. It is completely necessary and beneficial for the masses to expose and criticize their mistakes. Without the masses' criticism, mistakes cannot be thoroughly corrected.

	After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our cadres have been greatly tempered in the fiery struggle of the masses. Some cadres who took the wrong side have recognized and corrected their mistakes and have returned to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This is a great progress. We should trust such cadres, enthusiastically support their revolution, and boldly allow them to work. Some comrades can participate in the "three-in-one combination" leadership team, even as the first-in-command.

	Making mistakes and correcting them is good. This does not mean denying the past criticism of mistakes, nor is it a "capitalist restoration." This is done out of revolutionary necessity.

	Cure the Illness to Save the Person, Save the Person by First Curing the Illness

	Representative of the Shanghai Normal University Artillery Corps of the Red Guards, Zhū Bāndiān

	In the past, the former Party Secretary of our school, Yáo Lì, implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai. At the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, he also implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. At that time, our artillery corps posted a long big-character poster and, together with revolutionary teachers and students, held various meetings to seriously expose and criticize Yáo Lì's mistakes.

	In this process, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "examine a cadre's entire history and all his work." We conducted extensive investigations and research on Yáo Lì's issues, carefully reviewed his entire history and all his work, and analyzed his performance at critical moments by elevating it to the level of the struggle between the two lines. A large amount of evidence proved that although Yáo Lì made many mistakes in the past few years, he stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line at key moments in the struggle between the two lines. At the same time, we analyzed Yáo Lì's attitude towards his mistakes. Through the masses' criticism, education, and help, he has a conscious revolutionary demand. This is reflected in the fact that, on the one hand, he made a soul-searching self-examination, and on the other hand, at the height of the criticism against him, he did not lie down and give up but actively requested revolutionary factions to give him work to do and actively went to the masses. Where the masses had the most opinions, he went there. He also assisted the revolutionary factions in educating cadres who made mistakes, urging them to go to the masses to check their mistakes. At the meeting to fight against a handful of capitalist roaders within the former Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, he was able to turn against them and expose the numerous anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the capitalist roaders within the former Municipal Party Committee. Based on these circumstances, we determined that Yáo Lì is a revolutionary cadre who has made mistakes, and thus proposed the slogan "Liberate Yáo Lì."

	At that time, the school was still filled with the slogan "Down with Yáo Lì," but we proposed "Liberate Yáo Lì." For a while, there was much discussion. Some people mocked us: "Those who wanted to grab Yáo Lì were you, and now those who want to protect Yáo Lì are also you." Some revolutionary comrades also suspected us of being "fake rebels" and "high-level conservatives," and so on. Faced with these pressures, we had intense ideological struggles. Some said: "Better to be 'left' than 'right'; being a bit 'left' is okay, at most it's a matter of understanding, but being a bit 'right' is serious, it's a matter of stance." Others said: "Initially, criticizing Yáo Lì was righteous, but now protecting Yáo Lì is not so righteous." Some even wanted to retreat, saying: "Rebelling to the end, don't end up with a conservative hat, just give up." With various active thoughts, we studied the "Three Articles." Chairman Mao's teachings made us realize that the essence of the thought of "better to be 'left' than 'right'" is still a matter of "self," because it is not based on the interests of the Party and the people but on personal interests of whether one makes mistakes or not. Because of starting from "self," one cannot correctly understand Chairman Mao's cadre policy and does not understand the dialectical relationship between "criticism" and "protection."

	Through discussion, we further realized that at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, it was completely necessary to expose and criticize Yáo Lì's mistakes. If Yáo Lì's mistakes were not exposed and criticized, the poison of the revisionist educational line and the bourgeois reactionary line in our school could not be thoroughly eliminated. Through exposure and criticism, he recognized his mistakes and was willing to correct them, returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We should protect him. Therefore, without the past criticism, we cannot talk about today's protection; the past criticism was righteous, and today's protection is also righteous. The "criticism" and "protection" of revolutionary cadres who have made mistakes are dialectically unified. This is the same as the principle of "curing the illness to save the person." "Curing" is for "saving," and to "save" one must first "cure."

	For this reason, our protection today is completely different in nature from the protection by the conservative organization at the beginning. Initially, they protected Yáo Lì's mistakes. Such protection, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, would inevitably cancel the criticism and the struggle. If protected in this way, the cover of class struggle in our school would not be lifted, the class lines would not be clarified, Yáo Lì would not be saved, and a handful of capitalist roaders would have the opportunity to sneak through, and our school's Cultural Revolution would not be able to proceed smoothly.

	Based on this understanding, we wrote another long big-character poster, continuing to criticize Yáo Lì's mistakes, and used a large amount of facts to affirm his support for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought as the mainstream and essence, supporting him to stand up and revolutionize.

	At the school-wide debate meeting on the issue of Yáo Lì, we expressed our views. After the debate, we gradually reached a consensus. Now Yáo Lì has been liberated and is serving as the deputy chairman of our school's revolutionary committee.

    编者按：正确地对待犯错误的干部，是当前运动中的一个重要问题，一定要解决好。这里发表的几篇文章，可以给我们一些启发。
    对待犯了错误的干部，要采取严肃、积极、热情的方针，帮助他们认识错误和改正错误。
    有些干部，在两条路线斗争中站错了队，执行了资产阶级反动路线，群众起来揭发批判他们的错误，是完全必要的，也是对他们很好的教育。不经过群众的批判，错误就不能彻底改正。
    经过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，我们的干部在群众斗争的烈火中，受到了很大的锻炼。一些站错了队的干部，认识和改正了错误，重新回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，这是一个很大的进步。对待这样的干部，应当信任他们，热情地支持他们革命，大胆放手地让他们工作。有的同志可以参加“三结合”的领导班子，甚至当第一把手。
    犯了错误，改了就好。这决不意味着否定过去对错误的批判，更不是什么“资本主义复辟”。这样做，是革命的需要。
    治病为了救人，救人必先治病
    红卫兵上海新师大师炮兵纵队代表　诸邦田
    我校原党委书记姚力在过去的工作中，执行了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线；在文化大革命运动初期，又执行了资产阶级反动路线。当时，我们炮兵纵队贴出了长篇大字报，并和革命师生一起，召开各种会议，严肃地揭发和批判姚力的错误。
    在这个过程中，我们遵循毛主席“要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”的教导，对姚力的问题进行了大量的调查研究，详细审查了他的全部历史和全部工作，并把他在关键时刻的表现，提高到两条路线斗争的纲上来分析。大量的事实证明：尽管姚力这几年犯了不少错误，但在过去两条路线斗争的关键时刻，他是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边的。同时，我们又分析了姚力对待错误的态度。经过群众的批判、教育、帮助，他是有自觉革命的要求的。这表现在，一方面，他做了触及灵魂的检查，另一方面，在批判他最激烈的时候，他并没有躺倒不干，而是主动地要求革命派给他工作做，主动到群众中去。哪里群众意见最多，他就到哪里去。他还协助革命派教育犯错误的干部，要他们到群众中去检查错误。在斗争旧上海市委内一小撮走资派的大会上，他能反戈一击，揭发了旧市委内走资派大量的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。根据这些情况，我们认定姚力是犯了错误的革命干部，于是提出了“解放姚力”的口号。
    当时，学校里还是一片“打倒姚力”的口号声，我们却提出“解放姚力”。一时，议论纷纷。有人讥笑我们：“以前要揪姚力的是你们，现在要保姚力的也是你们。”少数革命派战友也怀疑我们是“假造反”、“高级保皇”，等等。在这些压力面前，我们思想斗争很激烈。有人说：“宁‘左’勿右，‘左’一点不要紧，顶多是认识问题，右一点却不得了，是立场问题。”有的说：“当初批判姚力，理直气壮，现在保姚力，可不那么理直气壮。”有人甚至想打退堂鼓了，说：“造反造到最后，不要落个保皇帽子，干脆算了。”带着各种各样的活思想，我们学习了“老三篇”。毛主席的教导使我们认识到，宁“左”勿右的思想实质，仍然是一个“私”字，因为不是从党和人民的利益出发，而是从个人犯不犯错误的私利出发。由于从“私”字出发，就不能正确地理解毛主席的干部政策，不懂得“批”和“保”的辩证关系。
    经过讨论，我们又进一步认识到，文化大革命初期，揭发、批判姚力的错误，是完全必要的。姚力的错误不揭发、批判，在我校的修正主义教育路线和资产阶级反动路线的流毒，就不能彻底肃清。通过揭发和批判，他认识了错误，并愿意改正错误，回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，我们就应该保他。因此，没有过去的批，就谈不上今天的保；过去批，理直气壮，今天保，也理直气壮。对犯错误的革命干部的“批”和“保”，是辩证的统一。这就同“治病救人”的道理一样。“治”是为了“救”，要“救”必先“治”。
    正因为如此，我们今天的保，和保守组织当初的保，性质完全不同。当初他们保的是姚力的错误，这样的保，在文化大革命运动初期，势必取消批判，取消斗争。这样保下去，我校阶级斗争的盖子就揭不开，阶级阵线就无法划清，姚力就得不到挽救，一小撮走资派就有可能蒙混过关，我校文化大革命就不能很好地进行。
    在这个认识的基础上，我们又写了长篇大字报，继续批判了姚力的错误，并用大量的事实肯定了他拥护毛主席、拥护毛泽东思想的主流和本质，支持他站出来革命。
    在全校辩论姚力问题的大会上，我们亮了观点，经过辩论，逐步统一了认识。现在姚力已经解放，并担任了我校革命委员会的副主任委员。
