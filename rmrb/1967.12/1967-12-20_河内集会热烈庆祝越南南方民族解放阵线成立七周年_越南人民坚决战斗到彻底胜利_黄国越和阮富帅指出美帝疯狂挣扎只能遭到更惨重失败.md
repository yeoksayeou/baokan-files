The Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam's Permanent Delegation in North Vietnam, and the Vietnam Fatherland Front Hanoi Municipal Committee jointly held a rally on the afternoon of December 18 to enthusiastically celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam. They expressed their determination to advance and defeat the American aggressors.

Huang Guoyue, a member of the Standing Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front Central Committee and Chairman of the Vietnam General Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the opening speech at the rally. He recounted the glorious journey of the South Vietnamese military and people over the past seven years under the banner of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam, overcoming all difficulties, fearing no sacrifice, and highly developing the people's war, continuously thwarting all invasion plans of the American aggressors and their lackeys.

He pointed out that American imperialism has suffered a great defeat and is now in a desperate situation with no way out. However, American imperialism is still very stubborn and cunning. It is plotting new military adventures against North and South Vietnam and scheming to spread the war to the entire Indochina Peninsula. At the same time, it continues to spread the deceptive rhetoric of "peace talks." However, no matter what tricks American imperialism plays, it cannot save itself from its desperate situation. The more frantically it struggles, the more it will suffer even more humiliating and shameful defeats.

He said that the Vietnamese people will never retreat in the face of any sacrifice and hardship. The 31 million compatriots deeply understand the truth that "nothing is more precious than independence and freedom." They are determined to strengthen unity, fully carry forward revolutionary heroism, and vigorously implement Chairman Hu's sacred call to resist America and save the nation. They will advance, striking the American aggressors even more fiercely and accurately until they suffer a complete defeat.

Huang Guoyue finally expressed that the people of North Vietnam will uphold the spirit of "everything for the flesh and blood of the South" and are determined to smash all new escalations of war by the American aggressors, wholeheartedly completing the tasks of the rear for the front.

Nguyen Phu Tho, Acting Head of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam's Permanent Delegation in North Vietnam, delivered a lengthy speech at the rally. He pointed out that the birth of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam on December 20, 1960, marked an important turning point in the South Vietnamese people's struggle against America and for national salvation. Over the past seven years, with a correct political and military line, the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam has increasingly united the patriotic forces in the South, continuously achieving one victory after another in the sacred struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

Nguyen Phu Tho enthusiastically hailed the glorious achievements of the South Vietnamese military and people in the first two months of this winter and spring, annihilating 21 enemy battalions. He pointed out that this victory further demonstrated the passive and defeated situation of the American aggressors, mired in the quagmire, and the active and victorious situation of the South Vietnamese people, who are taking the initiative to attack and achieve victory and will achieve even greater victories.

Nguyen Phu Tho recounted the great victories achieved by the South Vietnamese military and people over the past seven years in armed struggle, political struggle, and the construction of liberated areas. He emphasized that the multifaceted great victories achieved by the South Vietnamese people over the past seven years, especially in defeating the largest-scale "limited war" launched by American imperialism, fully prove that as long as they are united, have a correct line, even a small nation can resist any imperialism, no matter how powerful.

Nguyen Phu Tho praised the support of the people of the world for the Vietnamese people's struggle against America and for national salvation.

Nguyen Phu Tho also exposed the American aggressors' plots to launch new dangerous military adventures against North and South Vietnam and to spread the flames of war to the entire Indochina Peninsula. He pointed out that American imperialism, in order to cover up its heinous crimes of war escalation, to deceive the American people and world public opinion, is continuing to spread the deceptive rhetoric of "peace talks." It is once again staging the farce of bringing the Vietnamese issue to the United Nations Security Council.

He said that the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam has repeatedly pointed out that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the affairs of South Vietnam. The stance of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam is: American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Vietnam, so to restore peace in Vietnam, American imperialism must stop its aggression against Vietnam, withdraw all its troops, military bases, and war tools from South Vietnam, and let the South Vietnamese people solve their internal affairs based on the political program of the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam. American imperialism must permanently and unconditionally stop bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The more frantically American imperialism struggles, the more it will suffer heavy defeats.

Nguyen Phu Tho said that the South Vietnamese people are determined to defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, resolutely fighting to the end.

Nguyen Phu Tho said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh once pointed out: "The closer to victory, the more difficulties there are." In the coming period, it will be the most intense and cruel period of struggle. However, the South Vietnamese people will never retreat in the face of any sacrifice and hardship. The 14 million military and people of the South will fight shoulder to shoulder with the 17 million people of the North, fully carry forward revolutionary heroism, advance, and strike the American aggressors even more fiercely and accurately until they suffer a complete defeat.

The rally finally passed a resolution, calling on all military and people of North Vietnam to overcome all difficulties, vigorously launch new competitions, resolutely smash all war escalations by the American aggressors, and wholeheartedly support their flesh and blood compatriots in the South. The resolution expressed the determination to defeat the American aggressors, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country.

    新华社河内十九日电  越南祖国战线中央委员会、越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团、越南祖国战线河内市委员会十八日下午联合举行集会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年，表示要乘胜前进，决心战胜美国侵略强盗。
    越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团委员、越南总工会主席黄国越首先在集会上致开幕词。他叙述了越南南方军民七年来在越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，克服一切困难，不怕任何牺牲，高度发展人民战争，接连挫败美国侵略者及其走狗的一切侵略计划的光辉历程。
    他指出，美帝国主义已经大败，正陷于走投无路的严重困境。但是，美帝国主义仍然很顽强和狡猾，它正在策划对越南南北两方进行新的军事冒险，阴谋把战火烧到整个印度支那；同时，它仍然喋喋不休地散布狡诈的“和平谈判”论调。可是不管美帝国主义玩弄什么诡计，也挽救不了它的绝望处境。它越疯狂地进行挣扎，就越要遭到更加惨重和可耻的失败。
    他说，我国人民决不会在任何牺牲和艰苦面前退却。我国三千一百万同胞深切领会“没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵”的真理，决心加强团结，高度发扬革命英雄主义，大力实现胡主席的抗美救国神圣号召，乘胜前进，更狠更准地打击美国强盗，直到它遭到彻底失败。
    黄国越最后表示，越南北方同胞发扬“一切为了骨肉南方”的精神，决心粉碎美国强盗的一切新的战争“升级”，全心全力完成大后方对大前线的任务。
    越南南方民族解放阵线常驻越南北方代表团代理团长阮富帅在会上发表长篇讲话。他指出，一九六○年十二月二十日越南南方民族解放阵线的诞生，标志着南方人民抗美救国事业中的重要的转折点。七年来，由于具有正确的政治和军事路线，越南南方民族解放阵线日益广泛地团结了南方的爱国力量，不断使南方人民神圣的抗战取得一个又一个的胜利。
    阮富帅在讲话中热烈欢呼越南南方军民在这个冬春季头两个月歼灭美伪军二十一个营的辉煌战果。他指出，这个胜利进一步表明了美国侵略者深陷泥潭、被动和惨败的劣势，表明了南方军民主动进攻、取得胜利和必将取得更大胜利的优势。
    阮富帅叙述了越南南方军民七年来在武装斗争、政治斗争和建设解放区方面取得的巨大胜利。他强调指出，越南南方人民七年来，尤其是在打败美帝国主义发动的最大规模的“局部战争”中取得的多方面的巨大胜利完全证实：尽管是一个小民族，只要团结一致，具有正确的路线，就能够抗击任何帝国主义，那怕是最强大的帝国主义。
    阮富帅赞扬了世界各国人民对越南人民抗美救国战争的支持。
    阮富帅还揭露了美国侵略者正在策划对越南南北两方进行新的危险的军事冒险和把战争火焰烧到整个印度支那的阴谋。他指出，美帝国主义为了掩盖它战争“升级”的滔天罪行，为了欺骗美国人民和世界舆论，正在继续散布狡诈的“和平谈判”论调。它又在重演把越南问题提交联合国安全理事会的丑剧。
    他说，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会曾经多次指出，联合国无权干涉越南南方问题。越南南方民族解放阵线的立场是：美帝国主义发动了侵略越南战争，那么，要想恢复越南的和平，美帝国主义必须停止侵略越南，把美国和它的仆从的军队、军事基地和战争工具全部撤出越南南方，越南南方的内部事务由越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领的基础上自己解决，美帝国主义必须永远和无条件地停止轰炸越南民主共和国。美帝国主义越疯狂地挣扎，就只能越招致惨重的失败。
    阮富帅说，越南南方人民决心战胜美国强盗及其走狗，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。
    阮富帅说，胡志明主席曾经指出：“越接近胜利，困难就越多”。在即将到来的期间，是战斗最激烈和最残酷的时期。但是，越南南方人民在任何牺牲和艰苦面前都绝不会退却。一千四百万南方军民誓同一千七百万北方同胞并肩战斗，高度发扬革命英雄主义，乘胜前进，更猛烈地、更准确地打击美国强盗，直到它遭到彻底失败。
    集会最后通过决议，号召越南北方全体军民克服一切困难，大力开展新的竞赛，坚决粉碎美国强盗的一切战争“升级”，全心全意地支援南方骨肉同胞。决议表示要坚决战胜美国侵略强盗，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国。
