The Vietnam War of Resistance Against the US for National Salvation has achieved a great situation.

The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are closely watching the moves of US imperialism and its lackeys, ready to take all necessary actions in the highest interests of the peoples of China and Vietnam and the peoples of the world in revolution, and to fully support the Vietnamese people until we completely and thoroughly wipe out the US aggressors!

Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao sent a telegram today to Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, General Vo Nguyen Giap, to extend the warmest congratulations on the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, General Vo Nguyen Giap,

Dear Comrade Minister:

On the occasion of the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army, I, on behalf of the Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extend the warmest congratulations to the fraternal Vietnamese people and all the soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army.

Under the wise leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, the heroic Vietnamese people and their army, united in the north and south, with a common hatred for the enemy, have grown stronger and stronger in the just war of resistance against the US for national salvation, firmly grasped the initiative on the battlefield, and continuously inflicted annihilating blows on the US aggressors. They have achieved a great situation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses." "Mobilizing the entire population creates an ocean that will drown the enemy." The brilliant victories of the Vietnamese military and people in resisting and defeating the aggression of US imperialism fully demonstrate the invincible power of people's war, thoroughly expose the paper tiger nature of US imperialism, and greatly inspire the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially the peoples of Southeast Asia, in their armed struggle against US imperialism and its lackeys. This has made a great contribution to the common struggle of the peoples of the world against US imperialism.

All reactionary forces will always make a final struggle against revolutionary forces. The US imperialism, already deeply mired in the Vietnam War, in order to get out of its unfavorable internal and external situation, is hurriedly plotting to expand its military adventures and, in collusion with modern revisionism, is playing the tricks of "bombing to force negotiations" and "bombing to force peace," and is trying to use the United Nations to intervene. However, these will absolutely not save it from its doomed fate of complete failure. We have always believed that the heroic Vietnamese people and their army will certainly be able to break through all difficulties, smash all the enemy's plots and tricks, and achieve final victory in the great war of resistance against the US for national salvation.

The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in accordance with the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, have always regarded the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the US for national salvation as our own cause and have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the US for national salvation as our internationalist duty. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are more powerful and better prepared. We are closely watching the moves of US imperialism and its lackeys, ready to take all necessary actions in the highest interests of the peoples of China and Vietnam and the peoples of the world in revolution, and to fully support the Vietnamese people's great war of resistance against the US for national salvation until we completely and thoroughly wipe out the US aggressors!

Long live the combat friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Vietnam!

Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, Lin Biao

    林彪同志致电武元甲同志最热烈祝贺越南人民军建军二十三周年
    越南抗美救国战争打出了一片大好形势
    中国人民和中国人民解放军正严密注视着美帝及其帮凶的一举一动，随时准备采取符合中越两国人民和世界革命人民最高利益的一切必要的行动，全力支援兄弟的越南人民，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底消灭干净！
    新华社二十一日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪同志今天打电报给越南民主共和国副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将，最热烈祝贺越南人民军建军二十三周年。贺电全文如下：越南民主共和国副总理兼国防部长武元甲大将亲爱的部长同志：
    在越南人民军建军二十三周年的时候，我谨代表中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员，向兄弟的越南人民和越南人民军全体战友，致以最热烈的祝贺。
    英雄的越南人民及其军队，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的英明领导下，南北一心，同仇敌忾，在抗美救国的正义战争中，越战越强，牢牢地掌握了战场上的主动权，不断给予美国侵略者以歼灭性的打击。打出了一片大好形势。
    毛主席教导我们：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”“动员了全国的老百姓，就造成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海”。越南军民抗击和战胜美帝国主义侵略的辉煌胜利，充分显示了人民战争的无比威力，彻底暴露了美帝国主义外强中干的纸老虎本质，极大地鼓舞了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民，特别是东南亚人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争，为全世界人民反对美帝国主义的共同斗争作出了重大贡献。
    一切反动势力总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的。已经深陷侵越战争泥潭的美帝国主义，为了摆脱它内外交困的不利处境，正加紧阴谋扩大军事冒险，并伙同现代修正主义继续玩弄“停炸诱和”、“以炸迫和”的把戏，并企图利用联合国插手。但是，这些都绝对挽救不了它走向彻底失败的命运。我们一贯坚信，英雄的越南人民及其军队，一定能够冲破一切困难，粉碎敌人的种种阴谋毒计，取得伟大抗美救国斗争的最后胜利。
    中国人民和中国人民解放军，坚决遵循我们的伟大统帅毛主席的教导，一向把越南人民的抗美救国斗争当作自己的事业，一向把支援兄弟的越南人民的抗美救国斗争当作自己应尽的国际主义义务。用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼的中国人民和中国人民解放军，力量更加强大了，准备更加充分了。我们正严密注视着美帝国主义及其帮凶的一举一动，随时准备采取符合中越两国人民和世界革命人民最高利益的一切必要的行动，全力支援兄弟的越南人民的伟大抗美救国斗争，直到把美国侵略者全部彻底消灭干净！
    中越两国人民和两国军队之间的战斗友谊万岁！
    中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长　林　彪
                            一九六七年十二月二十一日于北京
