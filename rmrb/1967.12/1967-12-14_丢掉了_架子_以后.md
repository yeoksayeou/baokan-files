	After Abandoning the "Pose"

	Past Lessons

	Mu Yutuo, deputy director of the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing General Factory Revolutionary Committee, was originally a technician. In April 1965, he was promoted to deputy section chief. When he was a technician, his relationship with the masses was very good, and everyone affectionately called him "Old Mu." Later, when he became deputy section chief, he thought that a section chief should have the demeanor of a section chief; otherwise, people would look down on him. Therefore, he always put on a "section chief" pose, and he even felt uncomfortable when comrades affectionately called him "Old Mu," thinking it was disrespectful. Thus, some people started calling him "Section Chief Mu." He felt pleased hearing that.

	Mu Yutuo began his leadership work with little experience in all aspects. He should have followed Chairman Mao's great teachings of "consulting the masses on every matter and being a student of the masses," learning from the masses humbly. But he did not think this way. He always thought he was more capable than the masses and wanted to handle and decide everything on his own. After designing the blueprints, without sufficient discussion with comrades, he decided to produce the sample himself, resulting in products that often did not meet actual needs. He rarely participated in labor and knew little about the actual situation, but during meetings, he would speak endlessly. He liked to hear flattery and became unhappy when criticized, and he also liked to reprimand others. Some people, seeing this, did not want to give him suggestions anymore.

	"Being a section chief means having the demeanor of a section chief." Under this wrong thinking, Mu Yutuo, in the more than a year he served as deputy section chief, gradually lost the support and trust of the masses.

	In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, Mu Yutuo committed serious errors in executing the bourgeois reactionary line, and some revolutionary masses who had been suppressed were very angry and criticized and struggled against him many times.

	At first, Mu Yutuo did not understand why the masses were so angry with him and felt very resentful. Later, he studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. Chairman Mao taught us, "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant, not understanding this point, we cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." Chairman Mao's teachings and the criticisms and help from the revolutionary masses opened Mu Yutuo's mind. He began to understand: the masses were angry with him because he had gone against Chairman Mao's teachings and had misunderstood the masses, not the other way around.

	New Beginning

	Mu Yutuo found the root of his problem and took decisive measures to cure it. He seriously examined his mistakes to the revolutionary masses and stood with the proletarian revolutionary faction, becoming their close comrade. In late February of this year, when the proletarian revolutionary faction in the factory was in extreme difficulty, he stepped forward and gave great support to the revolutionary youngsters. In the joint struggle, Mu Yutuo saw the wisdom and strength of the masses and further understood the masses. Mu Yutuo deeply felt, "Rolling with the revolutionary faction, I feel strength throughout my body." The revolutionary masses also further understood Mu Yutuo in the struggle.

	After the factory revolutionary committee was established, he joined the "three-in-one" leadership team and was elected as deputy director, responsible for the factory's production. Besides holding necessary meetings and handling necessary affairs in the office, he spent most of his time in the workshops and departments, working with the masses. Not long ago, the production in the second workshop fell behind, so he went there with the workers to improve the work. In October, the assembly workshop was very busy, so he came here with everyone to work together, assemble together, and paint together, ensuring the completion of the production tasks.

	"Listen more to the workers' opinions, gather the wisdom of the masses, and support new initiatives," this is what he demanded of himself to correct his past habit of talking endlessly as soon as he got off the car. During this period, he indeed did this, going wherever he went, first humbly listening to the masses' opinions, and if the masses were right, he would follow their advice. The workers in the assembly workshop suggested that the inspection personnel be divided into the workshop to work with the workers, and he supported this correct opinion, changing the past phenomenon of separating inspection from labor, and improving work efficiency.

	"What place criticizes me, I go to that place; where the masses give me suggestions, I go to listen." This is Mu Yutuo's current attitude towards the masses' criticisms. In July of this year, when the factory's production was quite outstanding, he had some arrogant feelings at that time, and comrades seriously pointed out this problem to him, and he quickly corrected it.

	Now, the workers no longer call him "Section Chief Mu" but affectionately call him "Old Mu" again. He has abandoned his past pose and is harmonious with the masses.

### 丢掉了“架子”以后

　　丢掉了“架子”以后
　　过去的教训
    济南汽车制造总厂革委会副主任沐育托，原来是个技术员，一九六五年四月才被提拔为副科长。他在当技术员的时候，和群众的关系很好，大家都亲切地称呼他“老沐”。后来当了副科长，他就想，当科长就得有个科长的样子，不然人家会瞧不起。于是，他逢人便摆出一副“科长”的架子，连同志们亲切地称他“老沐”，也觉得不舒服了，认为这是对他“不尊重”。这样，有些人就叫他“沐科长”了。他听着心里乐滋滋的。
    沐育托开始担任领导工作，各方面经验都比较缺乏。照理，他更应当遵循毛主席关于“遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的伟大教导，拜群众为师，虚心向群众学习。但他并不这样想。他总觉得自己比群众高明，在决定和处理问题的时候，总想个人包办代替。设计出图样以后，未经同志们充分讨论，就自己决定试制样品，结果试制出来的东西往往不符合实际需要。他很少参加劳动，对实际情况了解不多，但一开会，却滔滔不绝地发表“演说”。他爱听恭维话，听到批评就不高兴，还喜欢训人。有些人见他这样，就不愿意再给他提意见了。
    “当科长就得有个科长的样子。”在这种错误的思想指导下，沐育托在担任副科长一年多的时间里，越来越失去了群众的支持和信任。
    在文化大革命运动初期，沐育托犯了执行资产阶级反动路线的严重错误，一些受到打击、压制的革命群众非常气愤，对他进行了多次的批判和斗争。
    开始，沐育托不理解群众为什么对他有那么大的气，心里很不服气。后来，他带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席谆谆教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”毛主席的教导，革命群众的批评和帮助，打开了沐育托的心窍。他开始明白了：群众对他有气，根本原因是自己违背了毛主席的教导，是自己错看了群众，而不是群众错看了自己。
　　新的开端
    沐育托找到了病根，就对症下药，痛下决心医治自己的毛病。他认真地向革命群众检查了自己的错误，到群众中去，跟无产阶级革命派站在一起，做了他们的亲密战友。今年二月底，当厂里的无产阶级革命派处于极端困难的时候，他挺身而出，给了革命小将很大的支持。在共同的战斗中，沐育托看到了群众的智慧和力量，进一步了解了群众。沐育托深有体会地说：“跟革命派滚在一起，我浑身感到有了力量。”革命群众在斗争中也进一步了解了沐育托。
    工厂革命委员会成立以后，他参加了“三结合”领导班子，被推选为副主任，分工抓全厂的生产。他除了在办公室里开一些必要的会，处理一些必要的事务以外，其余大部分时间就到车间、科室里去，和群众在一起。不久以前，二车间生产一度落后，他就到二车间和工人一起，改进了工作。十月份，总装车间生产很紧张，他又来到这里和大家一起劳动，一起安装，一起刷漆，保证了生产任务的圆满完成。
    “多听工人意见，集中群众智慧，支持新的创议”，这是他针对过去“下车伊始”就哇啦哇啦好发议论的缺点，对自己提出的要求。这个时期以来，他确实这样做了，走到那里，首先就虚心地听取群众的意见，群众说得对的，就照办。总装车间的工人建议把检查站人员分到车间和工人一起干，他支持了这个正确的意见，改变了过去检查和劳动分家的现象，提高了工作效率。
    “什么地方轰我，我就到什么地方去；那里群众给我提意见，我就到那里去听。”这是沐育托现在对待群众批评所采取的态度。今年七月，厂里生产搞得比较出色，当时他有些骄傲情绪，同志们严肃地给他指出了这个问题，他很快就改正了。
    现在，工人们不再叫他“沐科长”，仍然亲切地称呼他“老沐”了。他丢掉了过去的架子，和群众融洽无间了。　本报记者
