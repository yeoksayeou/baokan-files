Delegates attending the Guizhou Province Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works have expressed their determination to support the heroic Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation with practical actions.

The delegates were thrilled to hear the news that our great leader Chairman Mao had sent a congratulatory message on the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. They unanimously shouted, "Victory will surely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!""

Representative Zong Renxian from a certain unit of the PLA said: Chairman Mao's congratulatory message to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam on its seventh anniversary is the highest and newest directive to the 700 million people of the entire country. We in the PLA must follow the example of Comrade Li Wenzhong and support Chairman Mao's support. We must always follow Chairman Mao's lead. In his congratulatory message, Chairman Mao pointed out that "the days of the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam are numbered." The Vietnamese people have already achieved great victories in their war of resistance against U.S. aggression. We admire the spirit of the Vietnamese people who are not afraid of sacrifice and fight bravely. We are deeply convinced that the Vietnamese military and people will surely drive out the U.S. aggressors by persevering in a protracted war! We and Vietnam are neighboring countries that depend on each other, and our two peoples are brothers who share weal and woe. We resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression. We are always ready, and as soon as Chairman Mao gives the order, we will fight shoulder to shoulder with our Vietnamese brothers and make our due contribution to the world revolutionary cause.

Representative Tang Tairong from the Guiyang Cotton Mill said: Chairman Mao's congratulatory message expresses the feelings of the 700 million people of our country. We Chinese workers feel proud to have such a brave comrade-in-arms as the Vietnamese people. The victory of the Vietnamese people is our victory. We must stand together with the Vietnamese people, fight together, and win together. We firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call. Whatever the Vietnamese brothers need, we will produce it and support it. Currently, our mill has launched a wave of actively participating in Mao Zedong Thought study classes, seizing the revolution, and promoting production. Our mill has reached production levels in many aspects that have never been seen since its establishment. We strive to spin more yarn and weave more cloth. We are determined to support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression with practical actions.

Representative Guo Tianying from the poor and lower-middle peasants said: Chairman Mao always cares about the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. We poor and lower-middle peasants have been listening on the radio to the news of the Vietnamese people defeating the American devils, making them lose their helmets and armor, and fleeing in disarray. We are thrilled. We warmly applaud the Vietnamese people for fighting well and fighting fiercely. The Vietnamese people are truly great. Now, all revolutionary people in the world can see from the glorious example of the Vietnamese brothers that "as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We will resolutely be the strong rear guard of our Vietnamese brothers. We are determined to make the cultural revolution in the countryside even better and turn the countryside into a school of Mao Zedong Thought. We will build this base of the world revolution even stronger and more solid, and support the Vietnamese brothers' war of resistance against U.S. aggression with practical actions.

    贵州省学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会代表纷纷表示：
    决心以实际行动支持英雄的越南人民进行抗美救国战争
    本报讯　参加贵州省学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表们，听到了我们伟大领袖毛主席电贺越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的消息以后，一致高呼：“胜利一定属于英雄的越南人民！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    解放军某部代表宗仁贤说：毛主席对越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年的贺电，是对全国七亿人民的最高最新指示。我们解放军要象李文忠同志那样，“毛主席支持我支持”，时刻紧跟毛主席。毛主席在贺电中指出：“美国侵略者在越南的日子不长了。”越南人民在抗美救国战争中已取得了伟大的胜利。我们对越南兄弟不怕牺牲、勇敢战斗的精神非常敬佩，我们深信越南军民坚持持久战争，一定能够把美国侵略者赶出去！我们同越南是唇齿相依的邻邦，我们两国人民是休戚与共的兄弟。我们坚决支持越南人民抗美救国战争，我们时刻准备着，只要毛主席一声令下，就同越南兄弟并肩战斗，为世界革命事业做出应有的贡献。
    贵阳棉纺厂代表唐太荣说：毛主席的贺电说出了我国七亿人民心里的话。我们中国工人阶级为有越南这样英勇的战友而感到自豪。越南人民的胜利就是我们的胜利，我们要和越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。我们坚决响应毛主席的号召，越南兄弟需要什么，我们就生产什么，支援什么。目前，在我们厂里已掀起了一个积极参加毛泽东思想学习班，抓革命，促生产的热潮。我们厂在许多方面已达到了建厂以来没有过的生产水平。我们力争多纺一斤纱，多织一尺布。我们决心以实际行动来支援越南人民的抗美救国战争。
    贫下中农代表郭天英说：毛主席他老人家时时刻刻在关心世界人民的革命斗争，毛主席是世界革命人民心中的红太阳。我们贫下中农从广播中不断听到越南人民把美国佬打得丢盔弃甲、狼狈不堪的情况，我们心中真是兴奋万分。我们热烈欢呼越南人民打得好，打得痛快。越南人民真是好样的。现在全世界革命人民都可以从越南兄弟的光辉榜样中看到，“只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，我们坚决作越南兄弟的坚强后盾。我们决心把农村的文化大革命搞得好上加好，把农村办成毛泽东思想大学校，把我们这个世界革命的根据地建设得更加强大巩固，用实际行动来支援越南兄弟的抗美救国战争。
