In the summer, I returned home for a visit. My hometown is Gaojiazhuang in Zou County, Shandong. Upon arriving in my hometown, I saw that the fields were covered with rippling wheat, the ears heavy with grain, presenting a scene of bumper harvest. The placards with Chairman Mao's quotations were shining red, and the big-character posters criticizing the enemy were one after another.

I was so engrossed in the scene that I suddenly heard the sound of bells ringing behind me. Turning around, I saw that it was our village's car driver, poor peasant Zhang Grandpa, returning from the city with a four-horse carriage loaded with pesticides, farming tools, and a bundle of red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Zhang Grandpa shouted from afar, "Little fellow, you've come back at just the right time!" Saying this, he drove the carriage to my side. I leaped onto the carriage. Zhang Grandpa, holding the whip in one hand and driving the carriage forward with the other, pointed to the tall corn in the northeast corner of the road and said, "Little fellow, do you remember the year you enlisted? A cold wind blew in from the Chinese Khrushchev, and our village also started that 'three-self and one contract' nonsense, dividing that vast, flat land into forty plots and distributing them to each household to farm. As a result, the crops grew unevenly, affecting the harvest. This time, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our village studied Chairman Mao's works, criticized the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev's 'three-self and one contract,' and raised the class consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Everyone's hearts and efforts are united, not only has the land been consolidated into large plots, but our thoughts are also united."

Zhang Grandpa then talked about the Cultural Revolution. He said with deep emotion: "In March and April this year, under the instigation of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, our village also experienced a wave of economism. They incited the deceived masses to slaughter draft animals, distribute public funds, and even encouraged farmers to go to the city. Those unrepentant landlord and rich peasant elements also engaged in rumor-mongering and sabotage. We poor and lower-middle peasants, together with the stationed soldiers, firmly resisted this evil wind. This exposed the tails of the class enemies, and we poor and lower-middle peasants saw more clearly the reactionary faces of these bad elements." Saying this, Zhang Grandpa whipped the four horses, and they ran even faster.

Zhang Grandpa happily raised his whip and hummed a local folk song: "The Cultural Revolution brings new prospects, Mao Zedong Thought shines with golden light, everyone's thoughts are revolutionized, Gaojiazhuang has completely changed."

    高家庄变了样
    五好战士　倪文跃
    夏天，我回了老家一趟，我老家在山东邹县高家庄。到了家乡，只见田野里麦浪起伏，麦穗沉甸甸的，一片丰收景象，毛主席语录牌红光闪闪，大批判专栏一块接着一块。
    我正看得入神，忽听后面铃声叮当，回头一看，原来是俺村车把式贫农张大爷赶着一挂四套大马车从城里回来，车上满满装着农药、农具，上面还有一捆红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。张大爷老远就高兴地喊着：“小娃子，你回来的正是时候哇！”说着车子来到跟前，我一纵身跳上车。张大爷一手挥鞭驱车向前，一手指着公路东北角上那块一人多高的苞米地说：小娃子！你还记得你入伍那年，从中国赫鲁晓夫那里刮来一股阴风，咱村也搞什么“三自一包”，把那块一马平川的好地，硬分成四十块，分给各户种，弄得庄稼长得高的高，低的低，影响收成。这次无产阶级文化大革命，咱村大学毛主席著作，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的反动谬论，贫农下中农的阶级觉悟大大提高，大伙心往一处想，劲往一处使，不但土地连成了大片，思想也连在了一起。
    张大爷接着又谈起了文化大革命。他深有感触地说：今年三、四月份，在党内一小撮走资派的挑动下，咱村也刮起了一股经济主义歪风，煽动受蒙蔽的群众杀耕畜，分公积金，还鼓动农民进城。那几个没改造好的地主、富农分子也进行造谣破坏活动。咱们贫农下中农和驻村的解放军一道，坚决顶住了这股歪风邪气。这一下子，阶级敌人白脸狼的尾巴全露出来了，咱贫下中农也更加看清了这帮坏蛋的反动面目。说到这里，张大爷把鞭子用劲一甩，四匹大牲口放开蹄跑得更欢了。
    张大爷愉快地扬着鞭子，嘴里唱起了本村社员自编的山东小调：“文化革命新气象，毛泽东思想闪金光，人人思想革命化，高庄完全变了样。”
