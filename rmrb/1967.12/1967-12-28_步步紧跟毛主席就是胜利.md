The year 1967 saw the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Reflecting on the year's battle course, we deeply feel that:

Following Chairman Mao's lead at every step is victory.

Deputy Director of the Guang'anmen Railway Station Revolutionary Committee, Dong Zhen Ting

In 1967, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved decisive great victories. Guang'anmen Railway Station was no exception.

In September, Chairman Mao issued new directives on revolutionary great unity, immediately sparking a nationwide wave of revolutionary great unity.

On September 19, I, representing the "Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters," and another revolutionary mass organization, the "Contact Station," held a meeting and reached an agreement on the issue of revolutionary great unity. After the news spread, most of our organization's comrades were actively supportive, but there were still some comrades who couldn't understand it right away. They surrounded me, saying, "Comrade Dong, we've been rebelling together for several months. You can't sell us out, can you?" and so on. One after another, to be honest, the pressure on me was not small. At that time, my mind was like a hot pan, constantly flipping: should we rush into great unity now, with so many internal disagreements? Or should we take it slow? This is the great leader's latest directive, Mao Zedong's great strategic deployment, which must be resolutely and swiftly implemented.

Those days, I couldn't eat well or sleep well. I kept thinking: as a leader of an organization, what should I do in this situation? Should I pander to some comrades' wrong thoughts and give up implementing Chairman Mao's great directive? No, absolutely not! For Chairman Mao's directives, we must implement them whether we understand them or not. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to represent the interests of the broad revolutionary masses.

How to overcome the current difficulties? I analyzed the active thoughts of these comrades. Some did not understand or barely understood Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; some were plagued by petty-bourgeois factionalism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Following Chairman Mao's great teaching, I did enthusiastic and patient ideological and political work with them, studied Chairman Mao's works with them, discussed the great significance of revolutionary great unity, and helped them overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism. In this way, some comrades' thoughts gradually changed. With the great help of the People's Liberation Army, Guang'anmen Railway Station quickly achieved revolutionary great unity. Then, we held extensive classes on studying Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and criticize and repudiate the self," greatly overcoming petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthening proletarian party spirit. On the basis of revolutionary great unity, we achieved revolutionary three-in-one combination. Comrades who had previously not understood revolutionary great unity all said, "Comrade Dong, we were wrong. You were right then. You led the way well."

Looking back at the victorious battle course of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, we deeply feel that in any situation, implementing Chairman Mao's directives must be firm and unshakable; following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment at every step is victory. Looking back at the past and forward to the future, we are more determined than ever to follow the great leader Chairman Mao more closely, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment more closely, step by step, never leaving his side, from victory to greater victory.

    一九六七年文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利，回顾这一年来的战斗历程，我们深刻体会到：
    步步紧跟毛主席就是胜利
    北京广安门车站革命委员会副主任　董振廷
    一九六七年，无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的伟大胜利。我们广安门车站也不例外。
    九月份，毛主席发出关于革命大联合的最新指示，全国立即掀起了革命大联合的高潮。
    九月十九日，我代表“革命造反总部”，和另一个革命群众组织“联络站”的负责人开了一个会，就革命大联合问题达成了协议。消息传出后，我们组织的大多数同志是积极支持的，但是也还有一些同志一时想不通，围住我，说：“老董呀，我们和你一起造反几个月啦，你可不能把我们卖了啊！”等等，等等。你一言他一语，说实在的，对我的压力可不小。当时我的脑子象烙饼一样来回翻腾：马上大联合吧，内部意见一大堆；慢慢来吧，这可是伟大领袖的最新指示，是毛主席的伟大战略部署，必须坚决地迅速地贯彻执行。
    那几天我饭吃不香，觉睡不好，总在反复地想：作为一个组织的负责人，在这种情况下应该怎么办？难道迎合一些同志的错误思想，放弃执行毛主席的伟大指示吗？不能，万万不能！对毛主席的指示，理解的要执行，暂时不理解的也要执行。我们必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，才能代表广大革命群众的利益。
    怎样克服眼前的困难呢？我分析了这些同志的活思想，有的是对毛主席的伟大战略部署理解不深，或很不理解；有的是小资产阶级的派性作怪。毛主席教导我们说：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”我按照毛主席这一伟大教导，对他们热情地耐心地作思想政治工作，和他们一起学习毛主席著作，讨论革命大联合的伟大意义，帮助他们克服小资产阶级派性。这样，有些同志的思想逐渐转过来了。在解放军的大力帮助下，我们广安门车站终于很快地实现了革命大联合。接着，又大办毛泽东思想学习班。人人响应毛主席“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召，大大克服了小资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性。在革命大联合的基础上，又实现了革命的三结合。曾经对革命大联合一时想不通的同志，都说：“老董，我们错了，你那时作得对。你这个头带得好。”
    回顾一年来文化大革命胜利的战斗历程，我们深深体会到，不论在任何情况下，贯彻执行毛主席的指示都要坚定不移、毫不动摇；步步紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利。回顾过去，展望未来，我们更加下定决心，一定要更加紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，一定要更加紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，步步紧跟，寸步不离，从胜利走向更大的胜利。
