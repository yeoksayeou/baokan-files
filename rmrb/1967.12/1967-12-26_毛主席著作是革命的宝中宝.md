Chairman Mao's Works Are the Precious Treasure of the Revolution

Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill, Yang Fuzhen

	Two years ago, I received letters from sisters across the country asking me to buy "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" for them. They wrote, "We are so eager to get the precious book! But there are no books here. Shanghai is a big city, so please buy it for us." Little did I know that even in a big city like Shanghai, it was very difficult to buy Chairman Mao's works at that time. I searched all over Shanghai but couldn't find them. The sisters all wanted to study Chairman Mao's works and grasp Mao Zedong Thought, and they all wanted to get a set of their beloved books. But I couldn't buy them, and it made me feel very sad. However, at that time, I didn't know the reason. It was only during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that I solved this mystery. It turned out that the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, were up to no good. They opposed the great Mao Zedong Thought and opposed our study of Chairman Mao's works. They deliberately did not publish Chairman Mao's works, but instead published large quantities of "Cultivation of the Self." Their intentions were truly malicious! We workers must settle accounts with these bad elements.

	Whenever I think of the precious book, my heart burns with passion. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that liberated me, an orphan. Without Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, how could I have my today? Every bit of my progress, every bit of my achievement, is the result of Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao's works gave me strength, and Mao Zedong Thought nurtured my growth. In the past, I worked hard in production with a sense of gratitude. Later, it was Chairman Mao's precious book that enlightened me. Chairman Mao said, "Our army is a people's army. It is completely for the people, and it is thoroughly for the people's interests." Only then did I gradually understand the meaning of revolution. Weaving cloth is for the revolution. Thinking of the revolution, I had boundless energy. Entering the workshop was like going to the battlefield. All my thoughts were focused on the cloth, weaving more and better cloth.

	Chairman Mao taught us, "Class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are the three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state." However, in the past, I studied Chairman Mao's works but did not use them well. As a result, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, I took the wrong side. I was vigilant against the enemies with guns, the obvious enemies. But I did not see through those who waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, and I lost my vigilance. At first, the revolutionary youngsters helped me, but I could not understand and felt wronged.

	Later, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, and my mind was enlightened. Chairman Mao said, "Communists must be ready at all times to uphold the truth, because any truth is in the interests of the people; Communists must be ready at all times to correct errors, because any error is not in the interests of the people." "If one makes a mistake, one should correct it, and the sooner and more thoroughly one corrects it, the better." At this time, my mind became clear, and I felt very sorry and guilty towards Chairman Mao's teachings and towards my class brothers and sisters. So, I stood up to expose the crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and to rebel against them.

	Chairman Mao's teachings made me feel even closer to the revolutionary youngsters emotionally. I decided to learn from them and learn their proletarian revolutionary spirit. Soon, I also joined the revolutionary rebel organization.

	After more than a year of class struggle tempering and testing, I deeply felt that: We workers must always remember class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, and we must spare no effort to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must engrave Mao Zedong Thought in our minds and hearts, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our thoughts, and guide our actions. We must never deviate from Chairman Mao's teachings, forever follow Chairman Mao, and dedicate our lives to revolution and serving the people.

    毛主席著作是革命的宝中宝
    上海国棉一厂　杨富珍
    回想两年多以前，我曾经连续收到全国各地姐妹们的来信，要我代买《毛泽东选集》。她们在信中说：“我们多么想得到宝书呀！可是这里没有书，上海是大城市，请你给代买吧。”哪里知道，就是上海这样的大城市，在那时也是很难买到毛主席著作，我跑遍了上海也买不到。姐妹们都想学习毛主席著作，掌握毛泽东思想，都想得到一套心爱的宝书。可是，我没有给她们买到，心里感到很难过。但是，那时我还不知道是什么原因，一直到无产阶级文化大革命，才解开了我心中这个谜。原来是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派在搞鬼。他们反对伟大的毛泽东思想，反对我们学习毛主席著作，他们有意地不出版毛主席著作，相反地却大量出版《修养》。他们的用心真是狠毒极了！这笔账，我们工人一定要向这一小撮坏蛋清算。
    一提到宝书，我心头就热呼呼的。是毛主席、共产党将我这个孤儿解放了。没有毛主席，没有共产党，哪里会有我的今天。我的每一点进步，我的每一点成绩，都是毛主席教导的结果。毛主席著作给了我力量，毛泽东思想哺育我成长。过去，我是怀着报恩思想来搞好生产的。后来，是毛主席的宝书开导了我。毛主席他老人家说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我才慢慢地懂得了革命的道理，织布，是为革命而织布。心里想到革命，干起来浑身都是劲。人进车间，就象走上战场，全副心思都摆在布上去了，把布织得更多更好。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动”。但是，在过去，我学了毛主席著作，却没有用好。结果，在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动开始时，我站错了队。对拿枪的敌人，明显的敌人，我是看得清楚的，是比较警惕的。但是，对那些打着“红旗”反红旗的坏蛋，我就没看清楚，失去了警惕。开始，革命小将们帮助我，我还想不通，一肚子的委屈情绪。
    后来，我反复学习了毛主席的有关指示，心中才开了窍。毛主席他老人家说：“共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是符合于人民利益的；共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。”“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”这时，我思想才“豁亮”起来，感到很难过，感到对不起毛主席他老人家对我的教导，对不起阶级兄弟姐妹们。于是，我就起来大揭党内一小撮走资派的罪行，大造他们的反。
    毛主席的教导，使我在感情上和革命小将们更加亲近了。我决心向他们学习，学习他们的无产阶级革命精神。不久，我也参加了革命造反派组织。
    经过一年多阶级斗争的锻炼和考验，我深深体会到：我们工人要成为自觉的无产阶级革命战士，一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，要下最大功夫活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想刻在脑子里，印在心坎上，用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想，来指导自己的行动，一时一刻也不违背毛主席的教导，永远永远跟着毛主席，干一辈子革命，为人民服务一辈子。
