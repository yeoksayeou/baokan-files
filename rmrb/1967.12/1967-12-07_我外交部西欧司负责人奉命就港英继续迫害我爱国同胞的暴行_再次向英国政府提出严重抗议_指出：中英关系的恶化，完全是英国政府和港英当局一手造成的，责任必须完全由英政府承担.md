The head of the Western Europe Division of our Foreign Ministry, on instructions, has once again lodged a serious protest with the British government over the continued persecution of our patriotic compatriots by the Hong Kong British authorities.

The head of the Western Europe Division pointed out that the deterioration of Sino-British relations is entirely the doing of the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities, and the responsibility must be fully borne by the British government.

New China News Agency, 6th December: The head of the Western Europe Division of our Foreign Ministry summoned the British Charge d'Affaires in China, Hopkinson, this afternoon to once again lodge a serious protest with the British government over the recent brutal suppression and persecution of our patriotic compatriots by the Hong Kong British authorities.

The head of the Western Europe Division enumerated the recent actions of the Hong Kong British authorities, including the forced closure of the Chinese Middle School, the raids and searches of the Hanhua Middle School, Xiangdao Middle School, Fujian Middle School, and the Mong Kok Workers' Children's School, the unlawful arrest of the principal of the Chinese Middle School, Huang Zufen, and over a hundred patriotic teachers and students, and the wanton destruction of portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao. These actions are a planned and premeditated persecution of the patriotic educational cause in Hong Kong and a serious provocation against the Chinese people.

He further pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities have continued to intensify their persecution of patriotic news, film industries, and patriotic trade union organizations in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong British authorities have unlawfully banned the publication of the patriotic weekly "Youth Paradise," conducted a so-called "trial in absentia" against the Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po," and threatened to issue a so-called "injunction." They have unlawfully arrested the chairman of the board of directors of the New China Film Company, Liu Yiyuan, and the director of the Phoenix Film Company, Ren Yizhi. They have raided and searched the South China Film Workers' Union and unlawfully arrested twelve of its members. They have also raided and searched the headquarters of the Motorcycle Industry Workers' Union in Kowloon and four other trade union organizations.

The head of the Western Europe Division, on instructions, once again lodged a serious protest with the British government over the aforementioned series of brutal suppression and persecution of our patriotic compatriots by the Hong Kong British authorities.

The head of the Western Europe Division finally emphasized that the deterioration of Sino-British relations is entirely the result of the brutal suppression and persecution of our patriotic compatriots by the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities. The Hong Kong issue is the crux of the current Sino-British relations, and without resolving the Hong Kong issue, there can be no normalization of Sino-British relations. The British government talks about "hoping to ease Sino-British relations" and "willing to restore normal relations between the two countries," but it continues to take actions that seriously damage Sino-British relations. This only exposes your hypocrisy. You cannot continue to suppress and persecute on the one hand while seeking to maintain so-called "normal relations" with the Chinese government on the other. If you continue to act recklessly, it will inevitably further deteriorate the current Sino-British relations, and the responsibility for this must be fully borne by the British government.

    我外交部西欧司负责人奉命就港英继续迫害我爱国同胞的暴行
    再次向英国政府提出严重抗议
    指出：中英关系的恶化，完全是英国政府和港英当局一手造成的，责任必须完全由英政府承担
    新华社六日讯　我国外交部西欧司负责人今天下午召见英国驻中国代办霍普森，就香港英国当局最近以来镇压和迫害我爱国同胞的暴行再一次向英国政府提出严重抗议。
    西欧司负责人列举了最近香港英国当局强行封闭中华中学，袭击和搜查汉华中学、香岛中学、福建中学和旺角劳工子弟学校，无理拘捕中华中学校长黄祖芬和爱国师生一百多人，悍然毁坏中国人民伟大领袖毛主席像和毛主席语录等暴行，指出这是香港英国当局对香港爱国教育事业有计划、有预谋的迫害，也是对中国人民的又一严重挑衅。
    他接着指出，香港英国当局最近还在继续加紧对香港爱国新闻、电影事业和爱国工会团体的迫害。香港英国当局无理禁止爱国周刊《青年乐园》出版，对香港《文汇报》进行所谓“缺席审判”，恐吓要发出所谓“禁制令”；无理拘捕新联影业公司董事长廖一原和凤凰影业公司导演任意之；袭击和搜查华南电影工作者联合会，无理拘捕该会会员十二人；并且袭击和搜查了摩托车业职工总会九龙分会等四个工会会所。
    西欧司负责人奉命就香港英国当局上述一系列镇压和迫害我爱国同胞的暴行，再一次向英国政府提出严重抗议。
    西欧司负责人最后强调指出，中英关系的恶化，完全是英国政府和香港英国当局残暴镇压和迫害我爱国同胞所一手造成的。香港问题是当前中英关系的症结，离开了香港问题就谈不上中英关系的正常化。英国政府口口声声说什么“希望缓和中英关系”，“愿意恢复中英两国的正常关系”，但却连续不断地采取严重损害中英关系的做法，这只能暴露你们的伪善面貌。你们一面在香港继续镇压和迫害，一面又想同中国政府保持所谓“正常关系”，这是办不到的。如果你们继续这样蛮干下去，那就必然要使目前的中英关系更进一步恶化，这个责任必须完全由英国政府来承担。
