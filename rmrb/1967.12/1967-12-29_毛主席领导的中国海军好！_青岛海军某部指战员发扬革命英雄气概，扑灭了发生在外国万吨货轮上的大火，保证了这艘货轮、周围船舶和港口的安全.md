The officers and soldiers of a certain naval unit in Qingdao, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, recently displayed a selfless and fearless revolutionary heroism, extinguishing a major fire on a foreign cargo ship of ten thousand tons, ensuring the safety of the ship, surrounding vessels, and the port. The foreign crew was deeply moved, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Mao Zedong! Long live China! Long live the Chinese Navy led by Chairman Mao! The Chinese Navy is great!"

This incident occurred in the early hours of the 13th. The engine room boiler of the Greek cargo ship "Kalimnos" docked in Qingdao Port suddenly caught fire. If the fire was not extinguished quickly, the surrounding oil tanks would catch fire, causing the entire ship to explode, directly threatening the safety of the port and other surrounding vessels. The captain sent an emergency distress signal to the Qingdao Port Authority. The duty room staff of the Qingdao Port Authority immediately notified the command center of the naval unit via telephone. All the officers and soldiers sleeping on the ships docked in the port quickly assembled, forming a fire-fighting force of over three hundred people, bringing their own fire-fighting equipment, and rushed to the scene.

At this time, the lighting circuits on the ship had been burned out, and the engine room was filled with thick smoke and raging flames. The first to board the ship was Comrade Li Baoshan, a Communist Party member and squad leader, who immediately led the way down to the engine room. Squad after squad of soldiers, shouting "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," followed him down into the engine room. The intense oil fire, suffocating smoke, and the extremely narrow and winding iron ladders in the compartment presented great difficulties for the soldiers. However, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, rushed to where the fire was most fierce; they fought where it was most dangerous. After finding the source of the fire, Li Baoshan quickly climbed up to the hatch and reported the situation. At this time, a crew member told the translator, "The temperature of the oil tanks in the engine room has suddenly risen, and in half an hour, there may be an explosion, endangering the lives of the people in the compartment." Everyone advised Li Baoshan to rest for a while before going down again, but he firmly said, "Don't worry about me, I am familiar with the danger!" With that, he led a dozen soldiers down again. After extinguishing the open flames, the political instructor Hu Chunlin led everyone to carefully inspect each hot pipe. When they discovered that the asbestos wrapped around the boiler was still burning due to the oil it had absorbed, the old soldier Zhao Fengyi bravely went into the narrow space between the boiler and the compartment wall to remove the asbestos. Deputy captain Zhang Chao bravely crawled under the hot boiler to remove the asbestos.

After more than three hours of heroic struggle, the fire was finally completely extinguished. The foreign crew on the "Kalimnos" was deeply moved. They repeatedly shouted in Chinese, "Long live Mao Zedong! Long live China!" One crew member asked the translator, "What were they reading aloud before they went down into the compartment?" The translator told him that it was the quotations from Chairman Mao. He said, moved, "I now know the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. Your army is invincible. There is no such army in the world, so brave, so fearless of death."

    “毛主席领导的中国海军好！”
    青岛海军某部指战员发扬革命英雄气概，扑灭了发生在外国万吨货轮上的大火，保证了这艘货轮、周围船舶和港口的安全
    据新华社青岛二十八日电　用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军驻青岛海军某部指战员，最近以无私无畏的革命英雄气概，扑灭了一场发生在一艘外国万吨货轮上的大火，保证了这艘货轮、周围船舶和港口的安全。外国船员异常感动，不断欢呼：“毛泽东好！中国好！”“毛主席领导的中国海军好！中国海军好！”
    这事发生在十三日凌晨。停泊在青岛港内的希腊籍货轮“卡里曼”号机房锅炉间突然失火。如不赶快扑灭，四周油柜一着火，整个货轮就要爆炸，直接威胁港口和周围其它船舶的安全。船长向青岛港务局发出了紧急求救信号。青岛港务局值班室人员立即通过电话，把这一求救信号，告诉了海军某部指挥机关。停泊在港内的所有舰艇上的熟睡的指战员，都以最快的速度，起床集合，组成了三百多人的灭火大军，自带灭火器材，向火场奔去。
    这时，船上照明线路已经烧断，机房内浓烟滚滚，火苗乱窜。首先登上货轮的共产党员、班长李宝善，一上船就带头向机舱冲了下去。一队队战士，高呼“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，跟着冲下了机房。满舱的油火，令人窒息的浓烟，和舱的异常狭小、弯曲的铁梯通道，给战士们带来极大困难。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军战士，那里火最猛，就往那里冲；那里最危险，就往那里扑打。李宝善找到失火点以后，迅速爬上梯口，把火情作了报告。这时，一位船员告诉翻译：“机房油柜的温度骤然升高，过不了半个小时就可能发生爆炸，舱内的人员就有生命危险。”大家劝李宝善休息一会再下去，他坚定地说：“不要管我，我熟悉险情！”说完，又带着十几名战士冲了下去。明火扑灭以后，指导员胡春林又带领大家仔细地查看每一根滚烫的管路。当发现锅炉外面包着的石绵由于沾着燃油仍在暗暗地燃烧时，老战士赵凤义就冒着生命的危险，到锅炉与舱壁间的夹道去剥掉石绵。副舰长张潮勇贴着滚烫的舱地板钻进灼热的锅炉底下敲掉石绵。
    经过三个多小时英勇奋战，一场火灾终于被彻底扑灭了。“卡里曼”号货轮上的外国船员深受感动。他们不停地用中国话同声欢呼：“毛泽东好！中国好！”一个船员问翻译：“他们下舱前高声朗读什么？”翻译告诉他说，是毛主席语录。他感动地说：“我现在才知道毛泽东思想有这样巨大的威力。你们的军队是不可战胜的。世界上任何地方都找不到这样一支军队，那么勇敢，那么不怕死。”
