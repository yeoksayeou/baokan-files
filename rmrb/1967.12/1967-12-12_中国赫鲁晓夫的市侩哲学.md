Liu Shaoqi, in his poisonous weed "Being a Good Party Member and Building a Good Party," shamelessly promotes a series of so-called "worthwhile" and "unworthwhile" fallacies. He claims that sacrifices that "most inspire people's admiration and are most remembered and praised by future generations" are the "most worthwhile"; that temporarily enduring a bit of hardship to gain "the trust and respect of the masses" is the "most worthwhile," and so on. In short, he advocates that one should first consider whether something is "worthwhile" for oneself.

Liu Shaoqi, this "worthwhile" and that "worthwhile," treats himself as capital for speculation, turning revolution into a business deal. Like a cunning speculator, he is always checking the market and gauging the direction. He goes where the profit is greatest and where the pickings are richest. His plan is to make a fortune and gain fame; to rise in rank and enrich himself. "Fame, profit, and status" are Liu Shaoqi's business principles, his black measuring stick for dealing with revolutionary causes. For decades, he has carried this black measuring stick everywhere, measuring everything to see if it is "most worthwhile," and then deciding his actions. As long as this political speculator thinks something is "most worthwhile," he will use sweet talk and disguise himself, hanging up the banner of Marxism-Leninism, peddling capitalist, revisionist, and feudal black goods to reap personal gains.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is entirely for the liberation of the people and is dedicated to working for the people's interests." "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and put revolutionary interests first, subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests." Communists engage in revolution voluntarily, aiming to eliminate all systems of exploitation and achieve the great ideal of communism, not to seek personal gains. "Completely" and "thoroughly" serving the Chinese and world people is our sole purpose and the red measuring stick for handling all matters. Our every word and deed must benefit the broadest masses of people to the greatest extent. Whatever benefits the Party's cause, we should say; whatever benefits the Party's cause, we should do. Whether it is working in a factory, farming, raising pigs, or sweeping streets, it is all needed for the revolutionary cause and for adding bricks to the edifice of communism. We should actively strive to do it well. To achieve the great goal of complete liberation for all humanity, we are willing to dedicate everything to the Party's cause, and there is no question of "worthwhile" or "unworthwhile."

Of course, achieving victory requires arduous struggle and paying a price. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To struggle means to make sacrifices, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests and the suffering of the majority. We die for the people, and that is a worthy death."

Liu Shaoqi, however, says that only sacrifices that earn others' "admiration," "remembrance," and "praise" are "most worthwhile." This is a great slander against Communist Party members! This is a great slander against countless revolutionary martyrs! We Communist Party members follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, wholeheartedly serving the vast majority of the Chinese and world people. For the victory of the revolution and the liberation of humanity, we fearlessly face the dangers of climbing mountains of knives and crossing seas of fire, shedding our heads and spilling our blood. Zhang Zedong, Dong Cunrui, Liu Huilan, Huang Jiguang, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Liu Yingjun, Li Wenzhong, and countless other revolutionary martyrs are our best examples. They achieved heroic deeds that are worthy of song and praise, not for the sake of others' admiration, remembrance, and praise, as Liu Shaoqi claims. Their selfless dedication, putting others first and themselves last, is something that Liu Shaoqi and his ilk will never understand. Those like Liu Shaoqi, with their heads full of bourgeois individualism, will never make any sacrifices when the revolution calls for them; they can only become despicable traitors. Therefore, Liu Shaoqi's so-called "sacrificing for the Party and the cause of the laboring masses" being "most worthwhile" is merely a fig leaf to cover his peddling of bourgeois fame and profit!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Let others enjoy the benefits, take the heavier burdens, endure hardships before others, and enjoy after others. Such comrades are good comrades. We should all learn this spirit of communism."

Liu Shaoqi, however, says: "In personal enjoyment," temporarily enduring a bit of hardship, as long as it can gain "the trust and respect of the masses," is "most worthwhile." This means "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage" is a profitable deal. This fully exposes the ugly soul of this old counter-revolutionary revisionist. For decades, he has used this black measuring stick of "self-interest" to peddle his philosophy of petty bourgeoisie. He says things like, "We joined the Party because we saw that personal problems could not be solved, so we first solve national problems. When national and social problems are solved, personal problems will also be solved"; "Serving the people wholeheartedly will bring personal benefits"; "Youths who seriously farm for three to five years can become county, provincial, or even central officials"; "Going to the front lines to be a soldier will lead to becoming a platoon leader, company commander, or regiment commander"; "When meeting people, be willing to suffer a bit, work hard and endure, and in the end, everyone will say you are a good person, everyone will want to be friends with you, and you will have great prospects"; and so on, endlessly. Liu Shaoqi's talk of "working hard," "enduring hardships," "working diligently," and "serving the people" are all just a facade, a disguise, only to gain false fame, deceive leaders and the masses, and use it as a stepping stone for personal advancement.

Liu Shaoqi raises the issue of "worthwhile" and "unworthwhile," and every word and sentence is about fame and profit. His evil intent is to use the bourgeois individualist view of "self-interest" to oppose the proletarian view of "public interest." He attempts to lead us into a dead end of struggling for fame and profit, thereby forgetting the revolution, forgetting class and class struggle, forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, forgetting the great ideal of Communist Party members, and becoming politically confused, becoming his tame tool for restoring capitalism. This is a foolish dream! We Communist Party members and the broad masses of revolutionaries are determined to smash Liu Shaoqi's black measuring stick of "self-interest" and use the red measuring stick of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people to measure our every word and deed. We will transform ourselves into selfless communists who wholeheartedly serve the people, and strive for the great ideal of communism to the end!

　　中国赫鲁晓夫的市侩哲学
　　沈忠东
    中国赫鲁晓夫，在他的《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》这株大毒草中，恬不知耻地鼓吹了一连串所谓“值得”和“不值得”的谬论。什么“最引起人们的敬仰，最为万世子孙所怀念所歌颂”的牺牲，是“最值得的”；什么“暂时吃一点亏”，换取“大家及群众所信任，所尊敬”，是“最值得的”，等等。一句话，就是一事当先，首先要考虑对个人是否“值得”。
    这个“最值得”，那个“最值得”，中国赫鲁晓夫把自己当作投机买卖的本钱，把干革命当成做买卖。他同老奸巨猾的投机商一样，时刻都在打听行情，窥测方向。那里利大就往那里钻，那里油水多就去那里捞。他的如意算盘是：既要赚大钱，又要名声好；升官发财，名利双收。“名、利、地位”，就是中国赫鲁晓夫的生意经，就是他对待革命事业的一把黑尺子。几十年来，他拿着这把黑尺子，走到那里量到那里，不管什么事，都要用它先量一量，看看是否“最值得”，然后才决定自己的行动。只要这个政治投机商认为是“最值得”的，他就花言巧语，乔装打扮，挂起马克思列宁主义的招牌，贩卖资本主义、修正主义、封建主义的黑货，去捞取个人的私利。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。共产党员干革命，是自觉自愿的，是为了消灭一切剥削制度，实现伟大的共产主义理想，决不是为了谋取个人的私利。“完全”“彻底”地为中国人民和世界人民服务，是我们唯一的宗旨，也是我们处理一切事情的红尺子。我们的每项言论和行动，都要符合最广大人民群众的最大利益。凡是有利于党的事业的话，我们就要说；有利于党的事业的工作，我们就争着干。不管是做工、种地、喂猪、扫大街，都是革命事业所需要的，都是为共产主义大厦添砖加瓦，我们要积极努力把它干好。为了实现全人类彻底解放的伟大目的，我们甘心情愿把自己的一切贡献给党的事业，根本就不存在“值得”“不值得”的问题。
    当然，胜利的取得必须经过艰苦的斗争，付出一定的代价。毛主席教导我们：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫却说，只有为别人“敬仰”、“怀念”、“歌颂”的牺牲，才是“最值得”的。这是对共产党人的莫大污蔑！这是对无数革命先烈的莫大污蔑！我们共产党人遵循毛主席的伟大教导，全心全意为中国和世界绝大多数人服务，为了革命的胜利，人类的解放，上刀山，下火海，抛头颅，洒热血，在所不惜。张思德、董存瑞、刘胡兰、黄继光、雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、刘英俊、李文忠等无数革命先烈，就是我们的最好榜样。他们做出可歌可泣的英雄业绩，决不是象中国赫鲁晓夫所说的那样，是为了叫别人敬仰、怀念、歌颂。他们“毫不利己专门利人”，一心为革命，一心为人民的高贵品质，是中国赫鲁晓夫之流永远也理解不了的。象中国赫鲁晓夫之流那种满脑子资产阶级个人主义的人，在革命需要他献身时，是决不会做出任何牺牲的，只能成为可耻的叛徒。因此，中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“为党与劳苦大众的事业而牺牲”，是“最值得的”，只不过是用来贩卖资产阶级名利主义的一块遮羞布！
    毛主席教导我们说：“享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫却说：“个人享受上”“暂时吃一点亏”，只要能换取“大家及群众所信任、所尊敬”，就是“最值得的”。这就是说，“吃小亏，占大便宜”，是一本万利的事。这就充分暴露了这个老反革命修正主义分子的丑恶灵魂。几十年来，他就是拿着这把“私”字黑尺子，到处贩卖市侩哲学。什么“我们加入党，是看到个人的问题横竖解决不了，先解决国家利益。国家社会问题解决了，个人问题也解决了”；什么“全心全意为人民服务，个人利益就会来”；什么知识青年“认真地种三、五年地，……就能当乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央”；什么“下连当兵，将来会当连长、营长、团长”；什么“如同人接触时，情愿吃点亏，……任劳任怨，最后大家说你是好人，大家愿意与你交朋友，将来还会有大发展”；等等，等等，不一而足。中国赫鲁晓夫嘴里说的“埋头苦干”，“任劳任怨”，“艰苦工作”，“为人民服务”，统统是一块招牌，一个伪装，只不过是为了博得虚名，骗取领导和群众的信任，作为个人向上爬的阶梯。
    中国赫鲁晓夫提出“值得”“不值得”的问题，字字句句离不开名和利，其罪恶用心，就是要用资产阶级利己主义的“私”字观，来反对无产阶级的“公”字观。企图把我们引入为名利而奋斗的死胡同，从而忘掉革命，忘掉阶级和阶级斗争，忘掉无产阶级专政，忘掉共产党员的伟大理想，成为政治上的糊涂虫，成为他复辟资本主义的驯服工具。这是痴心妄想！我们共产党人和广大的革命群众，决心砸碎中国赫鲁晓夫的这把“私”字黑尺子，要用“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的“公”字红尺子，衡量自己的一切言论行动，把自己改造成为大公无私、全心全意为人民服务的共产主义战士，为实现共产主义的伟大理想奋斗到底！
