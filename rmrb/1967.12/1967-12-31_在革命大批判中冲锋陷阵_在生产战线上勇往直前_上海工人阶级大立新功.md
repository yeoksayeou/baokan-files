Highly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advancing bravely, the heroic Shanghai working class has resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call, seized the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. Both the revolution and production have achieved tremendous victories, and the industrial and transportation front presents a thriving and prosperous scene.

Currently, the situation of the Shanghai proletarian cultural revolution is unprecedentedly good. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres on the industrial and transportation front, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and with deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, are charging forward in the revolutionary criticism and advancing bravely on the production front. Many factories have achieved outstanding results. The production of products needed for national construction and people's livelihood, such as steam turbines, motorized sprayers, handcart frames, fasteners, communication equipment, transistors, radios, leather, etc., has increased to varying degrees compared to the same period last year. The total industrial output value of the instrument industry system is the highest in history for the same period. Factories such as the Shanghai Electron Tube Factory, Shanghai Radio Factory No. 7, Shanghai Ferroalloy Factory, Shanghai Cold-Rolled Strip Factory, Shanghai Miniature Bearing Factory, Xinjin Pharmaceutical Factory, Shanghai Bolt Factory No. 8, Shanghai Ink Factory, Shanghai Dial Wire Factory, China Clock Factory, Shanghai Industrial Sewing Machine Factory, and Shanghai Wooden Box Factory, among others, have all significantly increased their total output value for the first eleven months compared to the same period last year. Factories such as the Shanghai Ink Factory, Shanghai Cold-Rolled Strip Factory, Shanghai Electron Tube Factory, Xinjin Pharmaceutical Factory, and China Clock Factory have all completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule and in excess. Particularly inspiring is that the printing and publishing tasks of the works of Chairman Mao, who is loved by the Chinese people and the people of the world, have been completed ahead of schedule and in excess this year.

The people's revolution guided by Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress. The good situation on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! This year, the broad revolutionary cadres have consciously placed the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, creating an unprecedentedly good situation where Mao Zedong Thought guides everything and directs everything.

The broad revolutionary cadres on the industrial and transportation front across the city have fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanghai, Chen Pi-xian and Cao Qi-qiu, in factories and enterprises. They have vigorously promoted proletarian politics, established Mao Zedong Thought, and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolution, production, and all work in factories and enterprises. The first major task for many units after the establishment of the revolutionary committees was to discuss how to infuse Mao Zedong Thought into their units and how to further improve the system of studying Chairman Mao's works to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. After our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and set up thousands of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various forms, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high.

The broad proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary workers have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to transform their souls, and their self-awareness of ideological revolution and class consciousness have reached an unprecedented height.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front always remember our great leader Chairman Mao's great instructions on "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and the great strategic principle of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." After seizing power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the "January Revolution" storm, the vast majority of factories and units have promptly established leadership teams for "seizing the revolution and promoting production" and restored normal production order. The broad proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production.

Chairman Mao said: "The army advances, production increases by an inch; strengthening discipline leads to invincible revolution." The vast majority of factories and units' revolutionary cadres remember Chairman Mao's teachings, consciously observe labor discipline, always pay attention to strengthening proletarian revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline, and always maintain abundant revolutionary enthusiasm. In some factories, when the masses have different opinions and views, they only unify their understanding through studying Chairman Mao's works and fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism during their spare time, striving not to affect production.

Firmly implementing our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's great teaching of "saving to make revolution" is an important feature of the Shanghai industrial and transportation front proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses' "seizing the revolution and promoting production" this year. They have thoroughly criticized the evil trend of showing off and flaunting wealth by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, established the fine tradition of thrift and hard work in everything by the proletariat, and formed a new trend of everyone finding tricks and everyone saving in many factories. The industrial front across the city has saved a large amount of metal materials, wood, chemical basic raw materials, and other major resources, with coal consumption decreasing month by month and quarter by quarter, and the consumption of all raw materials has decreased compared to the same period last year.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses on the Shanghai industrial and transportation front have thoroughly criticized the revisionist line of relying on bourgeois "experts" and the revisionist rules and regulations of "controlling," "blocking," and "managing" the workers by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. They have mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and vigorously carried out technological innovation and technological revolution. Many factories in the chemical, light, and machinery industries have not only greatly tapped production potential but also successfully developed many important new products urgently needed for national construction and people's livelihood. The revolutionary masses of the Dongfeng Chemical Pesticide Factory and the Shanghai Pesticide Research Institute actively developed "dwarfing agent" to prevent rice and cotton from lodging and "herbicide ether" to kill weeds. The revolutionary workers on the machinery industry front followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, walked their own path, dared to innovate, and successfully developed twenty-five new machine tools with high efficiency, good performance, and low cost.

    在革命大批判中冲锋陷阵　在生产战线上勇往直前
    上海工人阶级大立新功
    据新华社上海电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进的英雄的上海工人阶级，最坚决地响应毛主席的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，革命和生产都取得了巨大胜利，工业交通战线上呈现一派欣欣向荣的大好景象。
    当前，上海无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，工业交通战线的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的感情，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，在革命大批判中冲锋陷阵，在生产战线上勇往直前，许多厂作出了出色的成绩。国家建设和人民生活需要的产品如汽轮机、机动喷雾机、手推车胎底盘、紧固件、通讯设备、晶体管、收音机、皮革等的产量，都比去年同期有不同程度的增长。仪表工业系统的总产值是历年来同期最高的。上海电子管厂、上海无线电七厂、上海铁合金厂、上海冷轧带钢厂、上海微型轴承厂、新泾制药厂、上海螺帽八厂、上海油墨厂、上海仪表游丝厂、中国钟厂、上海工业缝纫机厂、上海木箱厂等一大批工厂，一到十一月份的总产值都比去年同期大大提高。上海油墨厂、上海冷轧带钢厂、上海电子管厂、新泾制药厂、中国钟厂等工厂已提前超额完成今年的国家计划。特别令人欢欣鼓舞的是，我国人民和世界革命人民无限热爱的毛主席著作，今年的印刷、出版任务都已提前超额完成。
    毛泽东思想指导下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。上海工业、交通战线大好形势的出现，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！今年，广大革命职工自觉地把学习毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，出现了用毛泽东思想统帅一切、指导一切的空前大好形势。
    全市工交战线广大革命职工，狠狠地批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在上海的代理人陈丕显、曹荻秋之流在工厂企业所推行的反革命修正主义路线，大力突出无产阶级政治，大立毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅革命，统帅生产，统帅工厂企业中的一切工作。许多单位革命委员会成立后的第一件大事，就是讨论如何在本单位中灌输毛泽东思想，如何进一步健全学习毛主席著作的制度，更好地活学活用毛主席著作。我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，上海工人革命造反派紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，开办了成百上千个不同形式的毛泽东思想学习班，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新高潮。
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工用战无不胜的毛泽东思想改造灵魂，思想革命化的自觉性和阶级觉悟空前提高。
    上海工交战线无产阶级革命派和革命群众时时牢记我们伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，绝大多数厂和单位在“一月革命”风暴中从党内一小撮走资派手中夺权以后，及时地建立起“抓革命，促生产”的领导班子，建立起正常的生产秩序。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担。
    毛主席说：“军队向前进，生产长一寸；加强纪律性，革命无不胜。”绝大多数工厂、单位的革命派牢记毛主席的教导，自觉遵守劳动纪律，时时注意加强无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，时时保持充沛的革命干劲。有的厂的群众产生了不同的观点和意见，双方也只是在业余时间通过学习毛主席著作，通过斗私批修来统一认识，尽量不影响生产。
    坚决贯彻我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大教导，是上海工交战线无产阶级革命派和革命群众今年以来“抓革命，促生产”中的一个重要特色。他们大破党内一小撮走资派讲排场、摆阔气的恶劣歪风，大立无产阶级勤俭节约、勤俭办一切事业的优良作风，许多厂都形成人人找窍门、个个搞节约的新风气，全市工业战线节约了大量的金属材料、木材、化工基本原料等主要物资，煤的消耗逐月逐季下降，所有原材料的消耗比去年同期有所降低。
    上海工交战线无产阶级革命派和革命群众，大破党内一小撮走资派依靠资产阶级“专家”的修正主义路线和对工人群众“关”、“卡”、“管”等修正主义的条条框框，放手发动群众，依靠群众，大搞技术革新和技术革命。化工、轻工、机械等工业的许多厂不仅大大挖掘了生产潜力，而且试制成功了很多国家建设和人民生活迫切需要的重要新产品。东风化学农药厂和上海农药研究所革命群众积极试制成功了防止水稻和棉花倒伏的“矮壮素”和除杂草的“除草醚”。机械工业战线的革命职工遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，走自己的路，大胆创造，试制成功了二十五种新的机床，效率高，性能好，成本低。
