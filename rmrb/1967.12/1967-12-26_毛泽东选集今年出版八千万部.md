The great thought of Mao Zedong illuminates all of China and the world!

Eighty million copies of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong have been published this year. Three hundred and fifty million copies of the Quotations from Chairman Mao have been published, 4,750,000 copies of the Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong, and 5,700,000 copies of the Poems of Chairman Mao. The triumphant completion of this glorious political task is a song of victory for Mao Zedong Thought, sung by the proletarian revolutionary forces and the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians of our country under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. The widespread dissemination of Chairman Mao's works throughout our country and the world has greatly promoted the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and powerfully advanced the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

The New China News Agency reports: In the unprecedentedly good situation of decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is shaking the world, our country's plan to publish eighty million copies of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong this year has been completed ahead of schedule. This brilliant achievement is an unprecedented victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory for the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

This year, the number of Chairman Mao's works published in our country and the scope of their distribution are both unprecedented. By December 20, the country had published 86,400,000 copies of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong (Volumes 1-4) in Chinese, in the languages of ethnic minorities, and in foreign languages. This figure is seven and a half times the total number published in the fifteen years before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the same time, our country this year also published 350,000,000 copies of the Quotations from Chairman Mao, 4,750,000 copies of the Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong, and 5,700,000 copies of the Poems of Chairman Mao. A large number of red copies of Chairman Mao's works have been swiftly delivered by the revolutionary cadres of our country's distribution sector to the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers throughout the country, and distributed to 148 countries and regions around the world, better satisfying the urgent need of the revolutionary peoples of the country and the world to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

This year's massive publication of Chairman Mao's works was carried out under the direct leadership and warm concern of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. This brilliant achievement is a song of victory for Mao Zedong Thought, sung by the broad proletarian revolutionary forces of our country's publishing, printing, and distribution sectors, the People's Liberation Army stationed in various places throughout the country to support the left, and the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in all sectors of the national economy, filled with boundless class feelings of love, faith, reverence, and loyalty for our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

An intense revolutionary passion to love Chairman Mao and be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought has drawn tens of thousands of printing, publishing, distribution, and revolutionary masses from all sectors into the great cause of printing eighty million copies of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the sabotage of a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists like China's Khrushchev, there were only thirteen printing plants in seven provinces and municipalities printing the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. This year, 181 printing plants in twenty-eight provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have honorably participated in the work of printing eighty million copies of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong. The revolutionary cadres of these printing plants regard participating in the printing of Chairman Mao's works as the most glorious political task. They say that printing a large number of Chairman Mao's works is an urgent need of our country's revolution and the world revolution, an urgent need of the proletariat and the revolutionary peoples of the world, and the greatest and most glorious historical mission bestowed upon us Chinese printers by the times. In the past, China's Khrushchev did not allow us to print revolutionary treasures, but now we must turn our deep hatred for China's Khrushchev into boundless strength to print more and better revolutionary treasures to satisfy the urgent needs of the broad revolutionary masses. Their battle cry is: "The more copies of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong we print, the more we add to the strength of the world revolution!" "The more copies of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong we print, the more spiritual atomic bombs of boundless power we produce!" "Let every revolutionary in the world get a copy of Chairman Mao's red treasure book!" "Let Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the world!" With the great support of the revolutionary cadres and the People's Liberation Army in the paper, ink, plastic, chemical, mechanical, coal, commercial, railway, transportation, postal, telecommunications, and civil aviation sectors, as well as in the supply of materials, the revolutionary cadres of the printing and publishing system have completed the glorious political task of printing eighty million copies of the revolutionary treasure book, the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, this year with the greatest political enthusiasm, the highest standards, the best quality, and the fastest speed.

The hundreds of millions of revolutionary peoples of our country and the world enthusiastically acclaim the massive publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works. After hearing the good news of the massive publication of Chairman Mao's works, the broad revolutionary masses of our country spread the word and repeatedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" In the vast rural areas of our country, the scene of massive distribution of Chairman Mao's works is unprecedented. In many places, after the poor and lower-middle peasants heard that the treasure-car was coming, some of them crossed mountains and rivers to wait for it, while others repaired the roads all night. Wherever the treasure-car went, the masses, old and young, sang and danced, beating drums and gongs to warmly welcome it, and held solemn ceremonies to present the books. When they received the shining gold treasure books, they were all overjoyed and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Some of them swore to Chairman Mao's portrait: "I will read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words for life, and do revolution for life!" Some of them were so moved that they had tears in their eyes and said: "I will pass down the revolutionary treasure book from generation to generation and be forever loyal to our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao!" Revolutionaries from Asia, Africa, Latin America, Oceania, Western Europe, and North America have expressed their most sincere feelings and most enthusiastic language in letters or articles in newspapers, warmly praising the red sun in the hearts of the peoples of the world, Chairman Mao, and the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. They acclaim: The widespread dissemination of Chairman Mao's works throughout the world has "made a great contribution to the international communist movement" and "advanced the revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world."

The widespread dissemination of Chairman Mao's works throughout our country and the world has greatly promoted the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being carried out in our country and powerfully advanced the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. Now, on the vast territory of 9,600,000 square kilometers of our country, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the top of the Wuzhishan Mountain, from the foot of the Tian Mountains to the coast of the East China Sea, everywhere shines the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. In the surging high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses do not leave Chairman Mao's books, do not leave Chairman Mao's words, do not leave Mao Zedong Thought, and do not leave Chairman Mao's teachings in their actions. They use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, transform everything, and use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, determined to turn the whole country into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary peoples of the world are learning and mastering the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, which has become an irresistible great historical tide. More and more revolutionary peoples are mastering Mao Zedong Thought, bringing about a new situation in the world revolution. Now, the flames of revolutionary armed struggle are burning everywhere in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The working class of Western Europe and North America, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has awakened anew; the Black people of America have also bravely taken up arms and fired the first shots of revolution within the world's number one reactionary stronghold. The revolutionary peoples of revisionist countries are gradually seeing through the traitorous faces of the revisionist clique, and the impending blazing revolutionary flames will surely burn the traitorous clique to ashes. A red world of Mao Zedong Thought will surely come!
