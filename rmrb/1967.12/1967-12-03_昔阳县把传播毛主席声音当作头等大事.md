Editor's Note: Comrade Lin Biao said, "When Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, it will become an inexhaustible force, a spiritual atomic bomb with boundless power." We must ensure that Chairman Mao's latest instructions and voice are transmitted to the masses as quickly and accurately as possible, so that everyone knows them and they are familiar to every household. We must also take various measures to ensure that Chairman Mao's instructions are implemented and carried out resolutely. This is the most important political and ideological work for the masses, and it is the fundamental key to promoting ideological revolution and completing all tasks.

Xiyang County Treats the Spread of Chairman Mao's Voice as the Top Priority

According to a report from our newspaper, transmitting the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao to the broad masses as quickly as possible, so that Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses, will become an inexhaustible force and will drive the Cultural Revolution forward, making the good situation even better. This is an extremely valuable experience gained by the revolutionary masses of Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, since seizing power.

Shortly after the establishment of the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, many tasks were not yet in place, but the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country" was issued. They immediately gathered over 400 production brigade cadres and more than 100 representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants to study the letter. At the same time, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture," calling on the people of the entire county to engrave the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in their minds and implement them in action. Subsequently, 20 communes in the county held mobilization meetings with the participation of 80,000 people, widely and deeply propagating and implementing the spirit of the letter. In this way, within less than ten days, the spirit of the letter became known to every household, and the elderly and children were all aware of it, creating a new upsurge of seizing the revolution and promoting production throughout the rural areas of the county. When the important instructions from Chairman Mao's inspection of North China, Central South, and East China were transmitted, they quickly organized poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to study and discuss them seriously. The county revolutionary committee, in spreading Chairman Mao's voice, acted swiftly. Upon receiving news in the morning, they would act immediately, without waiting for the newspapers, using all means and propaganda tools to transmit Chairman Mao's voice to the broad masses as quickly as possible.

Every revolutionary cadre of the county revolutionary committee places the spread of Chairman Mao's voice above all else. Over the past year, the county revolutionary committee, in addition to fully utilizing the county newspaper and cable radio, has also frequently organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and other methods to timely spread Chairman Mao's voice. Now, every village in the county has established a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, each team has a radio station, blackboard newspaper, and other propaganda tools. Recently, more than 200 cadres were dispatched from the county-level organs, carrying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, documents from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and articles from the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and Liberation Army Daily, such as "The Struggle Between Two Lines in the Chinese Countryside." They braved the snow and went deep into the grassroots to propagate and explain to the broad masses. Because the proletarian revolutionary masses of Xiyang County timely spread Chairman Mao's voice, they can always, in every matter, be in harmony with Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao and grasping the direction of the revolutionary struggle.

    编者按：林彪同志说：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”我们一定要把毛主席的最新指示，把毛主席的声音，最迅速地、不折不扣地传到群众中去，做到人人皆知，家喻户晓；还要采取各种措施，使毛主席的指示，项项落实，坚决贯彻执行。这是对群众最重要的政治思想工作，是搞好思想革命化、完成各项任务的根本之根本。
    昔阳县把传播毛主席声音当作头等大事
    本报讯　把伟大领袖毛主席的声音最迅速地传到广大群众中去，让毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，就能推动文化大革命乘风破浪地向前发展，使大好形势变得更好。这是山西昔阳县无产阶级革命派夺权以来的一条极其宝贵的经验。
    昔阳县革命委员会刚刚建立不久，许多工作还没有就绪，《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》就发出来了，他们立刻把全县四百多名生产大队干部和一百多名贫农、下中农代表集中起来学习，同时还学习了毛主席“农业学大寨”的指示，号召全县人民把伟大领袖毛主席和党中央的指示刻印在脑子里，落实到行动上。接着，全县有二十个公社分别召开了有八万人参加的誓师大会，广泛而深入地进行了宣传和贯彻。这样，不到十天的时间，这封信的精神就家喻户晓，老幼皆知，使全县广大农村出现了抓革命促生产的新高潮。当毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时的重要指示传达下来以后，他们又迅速地组织贫农、下中农和广大革命干部认真进行学习讨论。县革命委员会在传播毛主席的声音时，雷厉风行，早上得知，早上就动，听到广播，不等报纸，采取一切办法，组织一切宣传工具，以最快的速度把毛主席的声音传到广大群众中去。
    县革命委员会每一个革命干部都把传播毛主席的声音放在重于一切的地位。近一年来，县革命委员会除充分发挥县报和有线广播的作用外，还经常通过组织毛泽东思想宣传队等方法，及时地传播毛主席的声音。现在全县村村建立了毛泽东思想宣传队，队队有广播台、黑板报和其它宣传工具。最近又从县级机关中抽调了二百多名干部，带着毛主席最新指示、中共中央文件和《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部文章《中国农村两条道路的斗争》，冒着大雪，深入基层，向广大群众宣传讲解。由于昔阳县的无产阶级革命派及时地传播毛主席的声音，他们就能够时时、事事和毛主席、党中央心心相印，息息相通，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，掌握革命斗争的大方向。
