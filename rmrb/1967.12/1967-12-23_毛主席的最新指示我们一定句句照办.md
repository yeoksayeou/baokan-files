The latest instructions from Chairman Mao must be carried out to the letter by us all. The Beijing Fuxing District Mao Zedong Thought Study Class

On December 22, the *People's Daily* published an editorial titled "Vigorously Conduct Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes." When this news reached our Mao Zedong Thought Study Class in the Fuxing District, all the students were immediately stirred up. The broad masses of students excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is truly heart-to-heart with us revolutionaries." Chairman Mao said, "Do not always think you are right, as if the truth is all in your hands. Do not always think only you are capable, and others are not, as if the world would not turn without you." Isn't this a criticism of us? Everyone expressed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be seriously implemented, ensuring every point is carried out and every sentence is followed, integrating learning with practice, and seeing immediate results.

In our Fuxing District, starting from January this year, two mass organizations emerged among the residents. At that time, these two organizations attacked each other, each claiming their organization was revolutionary while the other was not. Thus, they engaged in a confrontation for ten months.

In September this year, our great leader Chairman Mao issued new instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The two mass organizations among the residents of our Fuxing District both actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, initially eliminating their differences and achieving revolutionary unity in organization.

However, although they united organizationally, they did not truly unite in thought, often falling into factionalism. You look at me with disdain, I look at you with disdain, neither side is satisfied, thus affecting the consolidation of revolutionary unity. Why do these problems exist? Mainly because Chairman Mao's latest instructions were not carried out resolutely, to the letter, but rather, only the instructions beneficial to oneself were followed, while those not beneficial were ignored.

How to consolidate and develop revolutionary unity in thought? This is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. We combined our actual situation with the study of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao teaches us, "As long as both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, they must achieve revolutionary unity under revolutionary principles." We analyzed the situation of both factions and decided that the two revolutionary mass organizations should jointly hold Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the highest guideline, with "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" as the key, actively applying Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and eliminating ideological obstacles.

We also organized the leaders of both factions to concentrate on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Both factions should speak less about each other's shortcomings and errors, let others speak about their own shortcomings and errors, and each should engage in more self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences." Through study, the leaders of both factions further realized that this is the most correct attitude to consolidate revolutionary unity in thought. Thus, both sides seriously and sincerely engaged in self-criticism of their own errors. They also realized that in the past, the reason both factions attacked each other was mainly due to the influence of anarchist thoughts, mainly because the "self" in their minds was at play. They deeply felt that "self" is the root of all evil and the source of all diseases. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would fiercely criticize and repudiate "self" in the study class. Only by overthrowing "self" can we better criticize and repudiate revisionism, overthrow and expose Chinese Khrushchev, and uproot the source of revisionism.

In the future, we will definitely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to the letter. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we will do; we will strive to actively apply the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest instructions, thoroughly transform our worldview, establish the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, and continuously consolidate and develop revolutionary unity. We will turn our Fuxing District into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    毛主席的最新指示我们一定句句照办
    北京市福绥境毛泽东思想学习班
    二十二日《人民日报》发表《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》的社论，一传到我们福绥境地区毛泽东思想学习班，全体学员顿时沸腾起来。广大学员激动地说：“毛主席他老人家和我们革命派心连心。”毛主席说：“不要总是以为自己对，好象真理都在自己手里。不要总是认为只有自己才行，别人什么都不行，好象世界上没有自己，地球就不转了。”这不正是在批评我们吗？大家表示：毛主席的最新指示一定要认真执行，做到条条落实，句句照办，学用结合，立竿见影。
    在我们福绥境地区，从今年一月开始，街道居民中出现了两个群众组织。当时，这两个组织互相攻击，各自都说自己的组织是革命的，对方不是革命的。就这样针锋相对地斗争了有十个月之久。
    今年九月份，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我们福绥境地区街道居民中的这两个群众组织，都积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，初步消除了隔阂，实现了组织上的革命大联合。
    可是，他们虽然从组织上联合了，但是在思想上并没有真正联合起来，经常闹派性。你看我不顺眼，我看你也不顺眼，互不服气，以致影响到革命大联合的巩固。为什么存在这些问题呢？主要是对毛主席的最新指示，没有做到坚决照办，句句照办，而是对我有利的就执行，对我不利的就不执行。
    怎样从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合呢？这是急需解决的问题。我们结合实际，学习了毛主席的最新指示。毛主席教导我们：“只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”我们分析两派的情况，决定两派革命群众组织联合举办毛泽东思想学习班，以毛主席的最新指示为最高指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，在灵魂深处爆发革命，扫除思想障碍。
    我们还组织两派头头，集中时间学习毛主席的最新指示：“两派要互相少讲别人的缺点、错误，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多做自我批评，求大同，存小异。”通过学习，两派负责人都进一步认识到，这是真正从思想上巩固革命大联合的最正确的态度。于是，双方对自己的错误，进行了严肃的、认真的自我批评。他们还觉悟到，过去两派所以互相攻击，主要是受无政府主义思想的影响，主要是自己头脑里的“私”字在作怪。他们深切地感到，“私”字是万恶之源，百病之根。大家一致表示，要在学习班中狠斗“私”字。只有斗倒“私”字，才能更好地批修，把中国赫鲁晓夫批倒斗臭，才能挖掉修正主义的根子。
    今后，我们一定坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做；要努力活学活用“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示，彻底改造世界观，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，不断巩固和发展革命的大联合，把我们福绥境地区办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
