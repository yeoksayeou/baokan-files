The world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner.

The boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought nurtures countless revolutionary heroes to grow rapidly.

Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao recently personally approved: awarding the "Model Support-the-Left and Love-the-People Platoon" title to the Fourth Platoon of the Sixth Company of the 601st Unit of the People's Liberation Army, and awarding the title of "Model Support-the-Left and Love-the-People Soldier" to the platoon leader Li Wenzhong.

This is the greatest concern, encouragement, inspiration, and spur of our great leader Chairman Mao for all the officers and soldiers of the entire army, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and the broad revolutionary masses of the country.

This is the glory of our great motherland and great army.

The Fourth Platoon is an outstanding collective of proletarian revolutionary heroes. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, they have shown unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao, never leaving his side. In defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses, and thoroughly smashing the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, they have established new and immortal merits. Chairman Mao's good soldiers Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, Chen Tiankui, and their comrades-in-arms have written a magnificent poem of supporting the left and loving the people with their lives and blood. They have truly practiced their iron oath:

	Chairman Mao loves me, so I love him,
	Chairman Mao supports me, so I support him,
	Chairman Mao instructs me, so I obey,
	Chairman Mao waves, so I advance.

They are a brilliant red banner on the "three supports, two militaries" front of our army.

They have set a shining example for our great era of being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Fight for Chairman Mao in life, die for Chairman Mao in death

The heroic Fourth Platoon and their unit arrived in Nanchang at a critical juncture in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in Jiangxi.

The heroic Fourth Platoon and their unit fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionary masses and the Red Guards day and night here to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, achieving one victory after another.

On August 19, the Fourth Platoon received a new order: to escort a batch of proletarian revolutionary fighters and Red Guards across the Gan River back to the countryside to make revolution. These revolutionary fighters had emerged from the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. Now, they were returning to their hometowns to seize new victories under the favorable conditions of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

What a glorious and important mission! The young soldiers of the heroic Fourth Platoon regarded it as another combat mission given to them by the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao. Before setting out, platoon leader Li Wenzhong, like every time he carried out support-the-left tasks, spoke to his comrades with fighting enthusiasm: "We fight for Chairman Mao in life and die for Chairman Mao in death. Protecting the proletarian revolutionary masses and the Red Guards is protecting Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

The eleven soldiers of the heroic Fourth Platoon thus set out on their journey with unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao in their hearts.

The car sped towards the Gan River ferry.

On the car, the proletarian revolutionary masses and the Red Guards expressed their boundless love and gratitude to the soldiers sent by Chairman Mao with the most sincere class feelings. The soldiers also expressed their deep concern and respect for the proletarian revolutionary masses and the Red Guards with the most sincere class feelings. The hearts of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who are absolutely loyal to the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, and the revolutionary fighters beat as one, becoming even closer.

People got off the car at the Gan River ferry. Platoon leader Li Wenzhong organized everyone to board the ferry and set sail for the opposite bank.

No one expected that when the boat reached the middle of the river, it suddenly swayed. The river water splashed over the side of the boat and into the cabin, and a shipwreck and drowning incident was about to occur.

In the face of danger, the heroes of the Fourth Platoon had only one thought: they must ensure the safety of their revolutionary comrades!

In the face of danger, platoon leader Li Wenzhong stood at the bow of the boat, calmly instructing everyone: "Sit tight!" and designated a few soldiers who were good swimmers to prepare for rescue. He loudly recited Chairman Mao's powerful words, "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory," to boost everyone's courage to overcome the rapids. The warm instructions of the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and the fearless heroism of platoon leader Li Wenzhong in the face of danger gave great encouragement to all the revolutionary fighters on the boat. Everyone shouted in unison with great enthusiasm: "Even if a typhoon of twelve levels blows, we will still cross the river!"

Unfortunately, the unexpected danger finally occurred: the water in the boat increased, the bow suddenly sank, and everyone on the boat was thrown into the rapids.

At this moment, the vast river surface suddenly rose with a moving cry:

	Long live Chairman Mao!
	Long live Chairman Mao!
	Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!

This cry was like a mountain echo, drowning out a thousand waves and suppressing ten thousand waves!

This was the heartfelt wish of the Red Guards and proletarian revolutionary fighters who had fought bravely to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, in the moment they struggled against the rapids and surfaced. In the most critical moment of life and death, they had no one to call for help, their hearts had only Chairman Mao! They remembered only Chairman Mao!

The voice of "Long live Chairman Mao!" became the command for the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon to trample the Gan River and rescue their comrades, and it became the great call for the revolutionary masses on both banks to rescue the Red Guards.

The voice of "Long live Chairman Mao!" rallied the people who rushed from all directions to rescue them into one will and one heart: even if they sacrificed themselves, they must save Chairman Mao's Red Guards!

Party member and deputy squad leader Li Congquan, although he was not a good swimmer, was full of courage and strength. Wherever there was the voice of "Long live Chairman Mao!", he swam towards it, using a small piece of wood to save three Red Guards in a row. Finally, when he saw a few revolutionary youths in danger, he immediately pushed the wood to them without hesitation, and with the revolutionary spirit of selflessness, he was swept away by the rapids...

Party member Chen Tiankui had just been out of the hospital for three days and was not fully recovered. He rushed towards the voice of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and fought fearlessly in the rapids, saving one revolutionary youth after another.

Party member Pang Chaosheng, inspired by the voice of "Long live Chairman Mao!", braved the waves and, in a short time, saved eight youths.

New soldier Li Zunming could not swim and had just climbed onto the wooden boat. However, when he heard the voice of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoing across the river and saw his comrades struggling, his heart burned with passion, and he jumped into the river again to rescue the Red Guards...

Heroic platoon leader Li Wenzhong, in the critical moment of the shipwreck, completely forgot himself and was the model for rescuing Chairman Mao's Red Guards fearlessly. With the great wave of "Long live Chairman Mao!", he dived into the water again and again, saving five Red Guards and revolutionary masses in a row. He was exhausted and had drunk a lot of river water, and could no longer hold on. But when he saw a few youths about to be swept away by the river vortex, he swam towards them without hesitation. Swimming and swimming, he could no longer go on. Soldier Yu Deqiang rushed to save him. He used his last strength to firmly order: "Don't worry about me, save the Red Guards!"

"Don't worry about me, save the Red Guards!" This was the heroic Li Wenzhong's last words, which most vividly, vividly, and profoundly reflected Li Wenzhong and the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon's most sublime proletarian spirit of selflessness. They thought of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's Red Guards in their last second of life.

More than fifty Red Guards and revolutionary masses were saved.

Chairman Mao's good soldiers Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, and Chen Tiankui sacrificed their young lives in this water battle and fulfilled their oath:

	Fight for Chairman Mao in life,
	Die for Chairman Mao in death!

	Unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao,
	Never leaving Chairman Mao's side

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers of the heroic Fourth Platoon showed unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao and never left his side. Over the past year, they have carried out support-the-left, support-the-workers, and support-the-peasants tasks, as well as military training tasks, from one region to another, from one battlefield to another. For Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and every combat order, they were unwavering, carefully understood, followed closely, and obeyed every word. No matter what the situation, their guiding principle was:

	Chairman Mao loves me, so I love him,
	Chairman Mao supports me, so I support him,
	Chairman Mao instructs me, so I obey,
	Chairman Mao waves, so I advance.

The world-shaking Red Guards movement had just begun, and our most beloved great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao gave it great concern and firm support.

On August 18 last year, Chairman Mao received the Red Guards from all over the country for the first time. At that time, the Fourth Platoon was on duty in a mountain village. At first, they did not understand the Red Guards movement very well, but as soon as they heard that Chairman Mao had received the Red Guards, the entire platoon was overjoyed. Li Wenzhong excitedly said: "Comrades, Chairman Mao has received the Red Guards! The great leader Chairman Mao supports and loves the Red Guards. Chairman Mao supports, so we support! Chairman Mao loves, so we love! Understand and support, even if we don't understand, we must support. It's not enough for us to support, we must also educate our relatives and friends to support."

That very night, the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon gathered around a small kerosene lamp, carefully writing letters home. Soldier Li Congquan and Chen Tiankui had low cultural levels and found it difficult to write, but they insisted on writing themselves. They said: "Low culture, but the requirement to follow Chairman Mao cannot be low. Only by writing it ourselves can we express our hearts." The next day, letter after letter flew to all corners of the country, each letter spreading the great news of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards, each letter educating relatives to be loyal to Chairman Mao, correctly treating the revolutionary masses movement, and cheering for the new Red Guards movement.

During the days when the Red Guards movement shook the country, soldier Ma Shouzheng suddenly received one letter after another from his brother, who was in charge of grassroots work in the local area, telling him that he had been "attacked" by the Red Guards and asking Ma Shouzheng to write a letter to the Red Guards to "speak for him." Ma Shouzheng faced a severe test. He believed that his brother was not a capitalist-roader within the party, but he believed even more in the Red Guards supported by the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao. He not only did not write a letter to the Red Guards to defend his brother but also wrote six letters to his brother in six days, educating his brother to correctly treat the revolutionary masses movement and follow Chairman Mao's revolution to the end. When he was about to write the seventh letter, his brother had already understood, expressing in his letter his gratitude to Ma Shouzheng for using the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought to dispel the black clouds and fog in his mind, and promising to learn from the People's Liberation Army, follow Chairman Mao, and follow the Red Guards, never stop revolutionizing, and always move forward!

Last year, when the Red Guards were on a revolutionary tour, batch after batch of revolutionary youths passed by the Fourth Platoon's station, heading to Beijing, the source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to receive the inspection of the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao. The hearts of the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon were almost day and night devoted to receiving the revolutionary youths. When the youths were thirsty, they brought them cups of hot water; when the youths were hungry, they brought them food; when the youths had blisters on their feet, they brought them water to wash their feet and helped them remove the blisters; when the youths were tired, they rushed up to take their bags and accompanied them over the mountains and rivers, sending them one after another. When parting, the soldiers always repeatedly entrusted the youths to take the distant soldiers' wishes for Chairman Mao's eternal life to the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao!

The red storm of the "January Revolution" swept across the country. Hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, following the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, rose up to fight against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

Chairman Mao called for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses and take on the great historical task of the "three supports, two militaries."

Chairman Mao gave the order, and thousands of troops immediately took action.

The Fourth Platoon went to the front line of supporting the peasants. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, wherever they went, firmly supported the revolutionary leftists; wherever they went, organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's works, sowing the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought in the hearts of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants; wherever they went, they worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants to seize revolution and promote production, making both revolution and production present a new situation. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised them: "Thousands of supports, tens of thousands of supports, the support of the comrades of the Fourth Platoon bringing Mao Zedong Thought to us is the greatest support. The Fourth Platoon has the firmest stance and the brightest banner, wherever they go, it is red, wherever they stay, it is red."

Li Wenzhong went to a middle school to carry out military training. The revolutionary youths of this school had a strong revolutionary spirit and strongly criticized a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. Li Wenzhong firmly supported them and studied Chairman Mao's works with them, fighting side by side. When they achieved victory after victory, Li Wenzhong made a slogan board for each of them, selecting a quotation from Chairman Mao for each of them according to their active thoughts, encouraging them to always listen to Chairman Mao's words, break private interests and establish public interests, and continuously transform themselves to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The most outstanding performance of the heroic Fourth Platoon was still in the support-the-left struggle in Jiangxi.

The great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao issued the order to the 601st Unit, where the Fourth Platoon is located, to go to Jiangxi to support the left in July this year.

The train sped across the vast fields of the motherland. The soldiers proudly recalled Chairman Mao's famous words:

	"Where are we going this time? To the misty and snowy Gan River."

At that time, the children of Jinggangshan, rich in glorious revolutionary traditions, had been fully mobilized. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the party were making their last struggles. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was at a critical juncture in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines.

As soon as the Fourth Platoon and their unit arrived here, they firmly stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resolutely defended the leftists, resolutely supported the leftists, and launched a general offensive against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

At the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, as soon as the Fourth Platoon put up the sign "Mass Reception Office," a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party instigated conservative forces to launch a soft and hard attack on them. Li Wenzhong firmly instructed his comrades-in-arms: "We must withstand the storm and thoroughly smash all the tricks of the class enemy!"

Here, they stood firmly, held high the banner, dared to take risks, and fought side by side with the revolutionary leftists. They remembered Chairman Mao's great instruction to "protect the leftists" and patrolled day and night, braving wind and rain, around the factory to guard the revolutionary criticism meeting venue. Wherever the leftists were threatened, they appeared there; wherever the leftists encountered difficulties, they rushed to support them. The leftist masses were deeply moved and tightly held the hands of the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, saying: "You are truly the relatives sent by Chairman Mao, the good soldiers of Chairman Mao!" The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon said: "Chairman Mao has given us a heart, supporting the leftists can only be close to the leftists."

The summer in Nanchang was like a furnace. The heroic soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, in the face of the class enemy's sabotage of production, wore military uniforms soaked with sweat all day, fighting side by side with the revolutionary masses in the workshop. Heroic platoon leader Li Wenzhong wrote on the blackboard in the workshop: "Grasp revolution, promote production, firmly guard the production posts, and prevent enemy sabotage" in eighteen large characters, encouraging people to spin more yarn, weave more cloth, and severely strike the enemy. He led the soldiers to learn from the workers, learn to operate machinery, and connect wires. Where the work was hardest, where the work was most tiring, they appeared there; where there were fewer people, where the work was urgent, they went there to take turns.

Here, they always took the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental task of supporting the left. No matter what the situation, they insisted on using the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought to arm the proletarian revolutionary masses, educate the deceived masses, severely strike the class enemy, and promote the revolution and production of the entire factory to move forward continuously.

An old worker in his fifties brought a list of past facts of being deceived and attacked by the masses to the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, saying: "I want to settle accounts with them!" The soldiers took the list and pulled his hand, saying: "No, grandpa! This account cannot be settled like this. Enemies have heads, debts have owners, thousands of accounts, tens of thousands of accounts, all should be settled with China's Khrushchev! The deceived class brothers are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line, you should help them to awaken. The soldiers feared that the old worker might not understand, so they took out their investigation of forty crimes committed by the capitalist-roaders within the party deceiving the workers and listed them one by one. Then, they opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and read together with the old worker: "We now lead a base area with a population of 91 million, but this is not enough, we need a larger one to achieve the liberation of the entire nation." The old worker suddenly realized, immediately threw away the list, and promised to listen to Chairman Mao's words, unite with the deceived class brothers, do work, and not take revenge.

After the proletarian revolutionary masses took power in the factory, someone opened their mouths with "We have won!" "We are the proud rebels!" Li Wenzhong saw it in his heart and thought about it at night, tossing and turning and unable to sleep. He thought that now some comrades in the revolutionary leftist camp had shown bad ideological tendencies, and they should quickly help them use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome them. The next day, he and his comrades-in-arms organized the responsible persons of the revolutionary mass organizations in each workshop to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "You have many merits and have made great contributions, but you must remember not to be arrogant. You are respected by everyone, which is justified, but it is also easy to become arrogant because of this. If you become arrogant, not humble, not work hard, not respect others, not respect cadres, not respect the masses, you will no longer be heroes and models." Chairman Mao's words deeply educated everyone, and those with arrogant and self-satisfied sentiments put down their burdens and moved forward.

The great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, during his inspection of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi and other provinces and cities, personally listened to the report of the deeds of the heroic Fourth Platoon, giving the soldiers of the heroic Fourth Platoon the greatest encouragement and boundless strength. Since Chairman Mao issued the great call to "criticize and repudiate revisionism," they have followed it with the fastest steps, most resolutely, and most quickly, together with the broad revolutionary masses, set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, promoting the great revolutionary criticism, great unity, and great combination of the three-in-one revolutionary torrent with an irresistible momentum, rolling forward.

	Greatly promote the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the boundless faith and loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought

Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, pointed out: Chairman Mao is the representative of our times, the representative of the party, the representative of the masses, the representative of the proletariat, the leader of the masses, and the soul of the masses.

The heroic Fourth Platoon, in the great era of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, became the first "Model Support-the-Left and Love-the-People Platoon" banner rising on the great wall of the People's Liberation Army, the fundamental reason is that they have boundless faith and loyalty to the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They regard the great promotion of the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought as the most glorious and great task bestowed by the times.

The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, in the old society, almost every family had begged for food. It was Chairman Mao who liberated their hometown, and they were freed from the heavy pressure of the "three mountains." Chairman Mao is the greatest benefactor and the closest relative in their hearts.

From the day they wore the red scarf, they vowed to be a loyal communist successor to Chairman Mao.

After they entered the great school of Mao Zedong Thought of the People's Liberation Army, under the guidance and inspiration of Vice Chairman Lin's brilliant example of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, followed Chairman Mao's instructions, and did what Chairman Mao's good soldiers said. Their lofty feelings of boundless love, boundless faith, boundless admiration, and boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao rose to a higher and more conscious level.

Every time they arrived at a place, the first big thing they did was to hang up the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait so that they could see Chairman Mao every day. When the soldiers wrote to their relatives, the first sentence was: "Most sincerely wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" When they went out on holidays, their only wish was to buy a beloved Chairman Mao badge. Sometimes, they had to move, and the revolutionary masses of the station wanted to take a photo with them to remember, and they left was Chairman Mao's portrait. They said: "Without Chairman Mao, we would have nothing. We will always love Chairman Mao."

Chairman Mao's good soldiers Li Wenzhong, Li Congquan, Chen Tiankui, and their comrades-in-arms, during the Cultural Revolution, specially made a new photo album, with every photo in it being Chairman Mao. Every time a photo of Chairman Mao was published in newspapers and magazines, they cut it out with boundless love and respectfully pasted it into the album. Last August, Li Congquan saw a photo of Chairman Mao in military uniform inspecting the cultural revolution army in the newspaper, jumped up with joy, and just wanted to paste it into the album when it was taken by the landlord's old man and pasted on the kang. Li Congquan, to obtain this beloved photo of Chairman Mao, walked twenty miles under the scorching sun to the city to buy it. He walked through every big and small bookstore in the city and finally found it in a magazine. The album became their most beloved treasure. They took it with them to climb mountains and cross rivers to welcome the battle, took it with them to brave the waves and strive for victory. They flipped through this beloved album every day, and every time they saw Chairman Mao's great image, they felt as if they were by Chairman Mao's side, feeling extremely happy from the bottom of their hearts, and full of energy.

One autumn evening last year, the Fourth Platoon saw the film "Chairman Mao and the Million Cultural Revolution Army" for the first time, saw the joyful scene of the great leader Chairman Mao with the revolutionary masses at Tiananmen, and was excited for a long time. The film had been over for a long time, but the barracks of the Fourth Platoon still echoed with cheers:

	Long live Chairman Mao!
	Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!

The deputy political instructor came to inspect the barracks at night and saw that Li Wenzhong, who was fast asleep, had a happy smile on his face, tears of excitement on his cheeks, and his lips moving: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao..."

This light call in the dream was the soldiers' lofty voice of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao!

The deputy political instructor was deeply moved by this moving scene and returned to the company to write a poem:

	The red sun is in the heart,
	The soldier thinks of you day and night,
	Thousands of words and ten thousand words in one sentence,
	Long live Chairman Mao!

Loving Chairman Mao, being loyal to Chairman Mao, is to follow Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to "definitely master Mao Zedong Thought" and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm oneself and command everything. The comrades of the Fourth Platoon regarded the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the greatest manifestation of loving and being loyal to Chairman Mao, and as the fundamental way to achieve ideological revolutionization.

For many years, they have always put the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, reading Chairman Mao's books every day without fail, and learning wherever they go. Heroic platoon leader Li Wenzhong set a rule for his work: the greatest responsibility of a cadre is to lead everyone to study Chairman Mao's works well. Here, the first weapon a new soldier receives when joining the army is Chairman Mao's precious book; the first class they attend is "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Squad leader Pang Chaosheng suffered from eye disease but insisted on reading Chairman Mao's books every day. His comrades-in-arms said to him: "You will ruin your eyes like this!" He said: "A revolutionary soldier, if he cannot study Chairman Mao's works well, even if his eyes are good, he is still blind; as long as there is Mao Zedong Thought in his mind, even if his eyes are bad, his heart will be clear and bright."

During the days of the Cultural Revolution, the soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, the mass movement of active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, entered a new stage. Platoon leader Li Wenzhong, at the beginning of this extremely great revolutionary movement, encouraged everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's books and study well Chairman Mao's great theory and great practice of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. He gave each comrade in the platoon a notebook, letting them specially copy Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Cultural Revolution, guiding them to clearly understand why revolution is needed under the dictatorship of the proletariat? Whose life is to be taken? How to revolutionize? Pang Chaosheng and Yu Deqiang, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement had just begun, heard some rumors during the day and studied "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" together under the kerosene lamp at night. The more they studied, the brighter their hearts became. Pang Chaosheng excitedly said to Yu Deqiang: "Chairman Mao's words, every word hits the heart. The revolutionary mass movement is really good!"

In the days of supporting the left, the situation was constantly changing. The struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines was extremely sharp and complex. The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, whenever they encountered something, would first bring the problem to Chairman Mao for consultation, "see what Chairman Mao says," and then "firmly act according to the highest instruction." There was a wood factory with a complex situation and fierce struggle between the two factions. As soon as the Fourth Platoon entered, they first encountered what to do? Support whom? They brought the problem to Chairman Mao's teachings on "the masses are the real heroes" and "no investigation, no right to speak," relied on the masses, conducted in-depth investigations, and according to Chairman Mao's teachings on class analysis, saw through the phenomenon to the essence and the mainstream, quickly identified and supported the proletarian revolutionary masses. They deeply felt: the support-the-left work is complicated, but as long as we advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, it is the brightest path, the path to victory.

Chairman Mao taught: the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches people's souls and solves the problem of people's worldview. "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." The heroic soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, in the great waves of class struggle, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, always regarded the transformation of worldview as the fundamental purpose.

In a factory, after the Fourth Platoon supported the proletarian revolutionary masses, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party colluded with some bad leaders of conservative forces to incite the deceived masses to slander and attack the Fourth Platoon. This was a face-to-face struggle. Was it "dare" to take the lead, fear no risks, and insist on struggling, or was it "fear" to take the lead, yield to pressure, and give up struggling? This was a severe test for the Fourth Platoon. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "There is no room for compromise on the line issue." "We must stand on the side of the masses and never stand on the side of the enemy. This is a fundamental issue of the stance of a Marxist-Leninist." Chairman Mao's teachings made them realize that "fear" to take the lead was "private" to take the lead, it was disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Only by fighting and overthrowing "private," the heart would be red, the will would be firm, and there would be an unyielding fighting spirit to repel the enemy's attack. Therefore, they launched a fierce attack on "private" with overwhelming heroism.

Platoon leader Li Wenzhong was the vanguard of the Fourth Platoon's attack on "private." He fought "private" the most thoroughly and resolutely, firmly grasped the line of struggle between the two lines, broke "private" and established "public." In a meeting to fight "private," he listed fifty-eight crimes of "private." One day, he met a proletarian revolutionary fighter on the road. The fighter affectionately said to him: "I haven't seen you for a long time, I thought you had left!" This ordinary sentence aroused Li Wenzhong's deep reflection. He dug deep into the "private" in his mind through this sentence, realizing that he had begun to distance himself from the masses. Why was this? He studied Chairman Mao's works while checking himself, discovering that he had a tendency to be complacent, thinking that the work situation had opened up and he could relax, so he did not pay attention to contacting the masses as before. He felt that distancing himself from the masses was disloyalty to Chairman Mao. He immediately went to the soldiers, exposed his private thoughts, fought his private thoughts, pointed out that having such private thoughts would not be able to well execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The next day, he led everyone to the workshop to better live and fight with the broad revolutionary masses.

The heroic soldiers of the Fourth Platoon, each one took Li Wenzhong as an example, consciously raised the struggle against "private" and the establishment of "public" to the height of the struggle between the two lines, and consciously raised whether to struggle against "private" and the establishment of "public" to the height of whether to be absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao. Their spiritual realm became higher and higher, and their ideological revolutionization achieved one leap after another. They deeply felt: to struggle against "private" and the establishment of "public," one must struggle at the crucial point and establish at the root. Being absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao, absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the greatest "public" of the proletariat, and we must establish it at this root.

The great Mao Zedong Thought nurtured the heroes of the "Model Support-the-Left and Love-the-People Platoon."

The heroes love the people, and the people love the heroes. In recent days, the glorious children of Jinggangshan, in the joyful shout of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's unprecedented good situation, with hearts full of respect and gratitude, presented bouquets of red flowers to the heroic Fourth Platoon.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought.

The soldiers of the Fourth Platoon remember Vice Chairman Lin's instruction: "All our achievements and victories are achieved under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and are the victory of Mao Zedong Thought." They, with the most respectful hearts, took off the red flowers from their chests and presented them around the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao. They shouted from the bottom of their hearts:

	All glory belongs to the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought!
	All glory belongs to the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao!

	Our most beloved great teacher, great leader, great commander-in-chief, great helmsman Chairman Mao, long live! Long live! Ten thousand times long live!

The first weapon a new soldier receives when joining the army is Chairman Mao's precious book, and the first class they attend is "In Memory of Norman Bethune."

Li Wenzhong, following the great wave of "Long live Chairman Mao!", dived into the water again and again, saving five Red Guards and revolutionary masses in a row.

    我们伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副统帅最近亲自批准：授予人民解放军六○一一部队某部六连四排以“支左爱民模范排”的光荣称号，授予这个排的排长李文忠同志以“支左爱民模范”的光荣称号。
    这是伟大领袖毛主席对全军指战员、全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的激励，最大的鞭策。
    这是我们伟大祖国和伟大军队的光荣。
    四排，是一个杰出的无产阶级革命英雄集体。他们在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫和支持无产阶级革命派，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的斗争中，建立了新的不朽的功勋。毛主席的好战士李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎和他们的战友，用生命和鲜血写下了支左爱民的壮丽诗篇。他们真正实践了自己的钢铁誓言：
    毛主席热爱我热爱，
    毛主席支持我支持，
    毛主席指示我照办，
    毛主席挥手我前进。
    他们是我军“三支”“两军”战线上一面鲜艳的红旗。
    他们为我们伟大时代树立了一个无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的光辉榜样。
        生为毛主席战斗死为毛主席献身
    英雄的四排和它所在的部队，在江西两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战关头，来到了南昌。
    英雄的四排和它所在的部队，在这里为保卫毛主席的革命路线，同无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将日日夜夜并肩战斗，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    八月十九日，四排接到一个新的命令：护送一批无产阶级革命派战士和红卫兵小将，横渡赣江，返回农村闹革命。这些革命闯将是从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下冲杀出来的。现在，他们乘无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，要返回家乡，去夺取新的胜利。
    这是一个多么光荣而重要的任务啊！英雄四排的年轻战士们，把它看作是伟大统帅毛主席交给自己的又一次战斗任务。出发前，排长李文忠和每次执行支左任务一样，满怀战斗豪情，对同志们说：“我们生为毛主席战斗，死为毛主席献身。保卫无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，就是保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。”
    英雄四排的十一名战士，就这样怀着对毛主席的耿耿忠心，踏上了征途。
    汽车向赣江渡口飞驰。
    车上，无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将们尽情地倾吐着对毛主席派来的亲人的无比热爱和感激；战士们也以最真挚的阶级感情，表达自己对无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将的深切关怀和敬佩。无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席的解放军战士和革命闯将的心，完全跳动在一起，贴得更紧了。
    人们在赣江渡口下了车。排长李文忠组织大家登上渡船，朝对岸驶去。
    谁也没有想到，船到江心激流处，突然摇晃起来。江水溅过船帮，漫进船舱，一场沉船落水的险情眼看就要发生。
    在险情面前，四排的英雄们只有一个想法：一定要保证革命战友的安全！
    在险情面前，排长李文忠挺立船头，镇定地嘱咐大家：“坐稳！”并且指定几个水性好的战士，做好抢险准备。他高声朗读毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这段威力无穷的语录，提高大家战胜激流的勇气。伟大统帅毛主席的亲切教导，排长李文忠临危不惧的英雄气概，给了全船革命战士以巨大鼓舞，大家异口同声豪迈地表示：就是刮起十二级台风，也要渡过江去！
    不幸，意外的险情终于发生了：船里积水增多，船头陡然下沉，船上的人一下子全被抛进了激流之中。
    这时，滔滔江面突然升腾起一片激动人心的呼声：
    毛主席万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    毛主席万万岁！
    …………  
    这呼声犹如山呼海啸，盖过千重浪，压倒万顷波！
    这是曾经为保卫毛主席革命路线而英勇战斗的红卫兵小将和无产阶级革命派战士，在奋战激流、浮上水面的刹那间，向我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，发出的最衷心的祝愿！他们在最危急的生死关头，没有人呼救，心里只有毛主席！唯独怀念毛主席！
      “毛主席万岁”的声音，成了召唤激流中的四排战士，去踏平赣江抢救战友的战斗命令，成了召唤两岸革命群众抢救红卫兵小将的伟大号召。
      “毛主席万岁”的声音，把从四面八方赶来营救的人们，拧成一个意志一条心：就是自己牺牲了，也要把毛主席的红卫兵救出来！
    共产党员、副班长李从全，虽然不大会水，但全身是胆，浑身是劲。那里有“毛主席万岁”的声音，他就游向那里，凭着一块小木板，一连救出了三个红卫兵。最后，当他看到几个革命小将处在危急中，便毫不犹豫地把木板推给他们，而自己满怀着舍己救人的革命豪情，被激流卷去……。
    共产党员陈佃奎，从医院出来刚刚三天，病还没有全好。他迎着“毛主席万岁”的声音，在激流中奋不顾身地战斗，救出一个又一个革命小将。
    共产党员庞朝胜，在“毛主席万岁”的声音鼓舞下，劈波斩浪，在短短的时间内，救起了八个小将。
    新战士李尊明，不会泅水，刚爬上木船。但是，他听到满江“毛主席万岁”的声浪，看到激战中的战友，满腔热血沸腾，又毅然跳进江里，去抢救红卫兵……。
    英雄排长李文忠，在沉船的紧急时刻，完全忘记了自己，是奋不顾身抢救毛主席的红卫兵的表率。他随着“毛主席万岁”的巨大声浪，一次又一次地潜入水中，一连救起了五个红卫兵和革命群众。他精疲力竭，喝了不少江水，支持不住了。但是，一看到几个小将即将被江心漩流卷走，便不顾一切地向他们游去。游着游着不行了，战士于德祥赶来救他。他用尽最后的力气，坚定地下令：“不要管我，救红卫兵要紧！”
    “不要管我，救红卫兵要紧！”这是英雄李文忠在生命的最后一刻留下的一句光辉的语言。它最集中、最生动、最深刻地反映了李文忠同志和四排战士无比崇高的无产阶级大公的精神世界。他们到了生命的最后一秒钟，心里想的是毛主席，是毛主席的红卫兵。
    五十多名落水的红卫兵和革命群众得救了。
    毛主席的好战士李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎，在这场水上激战中，献出了年轻的生命，实现了自己的誓言：
    生为毛主席战斗，
    死为毛主席献身！
    对毛主席赤胆忠心
    跟毛主席寸步不离
    无产阶级文化大革命中，英雄四排的战士，对毛主席赤胆忠心，跟毛主席寸步不离。一年多来，他们执行过支左、支工、支农的任务，也执行过军训任务，从这个地区到那个地区，从这个战斗阵地到那个战斗阵地，对毛主席的伟大战略部署，对毛主席的每一个战斗号令，都是坚信不移，认真领会，步步紧跟，句句照办。不论在什么情况下，他们的行动纲领都是：
    毛主席热爱我热爱，
    毛主席支持我支持，
    毛主席指示我照办，
    毛主席挥手我前进。
    震撼世界的红卫兵运动刚刚兴起，我们最最敬爱的伟大统帅毛主席，就给以巨大的关怀和坚决的支持。
    去年八月十八日，毛主席第一次接见了来自全国的红卫兵小将。这时，四排正在山村执勤。开始，他们对红卫兵运动并不怎么理解，但是一听说毛主席接见了红卫兵，全排立时欢腾起来。李文忠激动地说：“同志们，毛主席接见红卫兵啦！伟大领袖毛主席支持和热爱红卫兵。毛主席他老人家支持，我们就支持！毛主席他老人家热爱，我们就热爱！理解的支持，暂时不理解也要支持。光我们支持还不行，还要教育咱们的亲友都来支持。”就在这天晚上，四排战士聚拢在小煤油灯下，认真地写着家信。战士李从全、陈佃奎文化低，写信很吃力，可是他们坚决不要别人代笔。他们说：“文化低，紧跟毛主席的要求不能低。只有自己写，才能说出一片心。”第二天，一封封家信，飞向了祖国的四面八方，封封信都是传播毛主席接见红卫兵这一特大喜讯，封封信都是教育亲人忠于毛主席，正确对待革命群众运动，为新兴的红卫兵运动欢呼叫好。
    在红卫兵运动震动全国的日子里，战士马守增，突然接二连三接到在地方担负基层领导工作的哥哥的来信，告诉他自己受到了红卫兵的“冲击”，要马守增写信给红卫兵小将替他“说话”。马守增遇到了严峻的考验。他认为哥哥不是党内走资派，但他更相信伟大统帅毛主席支持的红卫兵。他不但没有给红卫兵写信替哥哥辩护，反而六天给哥哥写了六封信，教育哥哥要正确对待革命群众运动，紧跟毛主席革命到底。当他想写第七封信的时候，哥哥已经想通了，在来信中感谢马守增用光焰无际的毛泽东思想，驱散了他头脑中的黑云迷雾，表示一定要向解放军学习，紧跟毛主席，紧追红卫兵，不断革命，永远向前！
    去年，红卫兵进行革命大串连时，大批大批的革命小将，从四排驻地门前走过，奔向无产阶级文化大革命的策源地北京，去接受伟大统帅毛主席的检阅。四排战士的心，几乎日日夜夜都花在接待革命小将上了。小将们渴了，他们把一碗碗开水送上去；小将们饿了，他们端来菜和饭；小将们脚上起泡了，他们打来洗脚水，替他们挑去脚上泡；小将们累了，他们赶上去接过背包，陪着他们翻山越岭，送了一程又一程。分手时，战士们总是一再托咐小将把远方战士祝福毛主席万寿无疆的心愿，带给伟大统帅毛主席！
    “一月革命”的红色风暴席卷全国。亿万革命人民，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，起来向党内一小撮走资派展开了夺权斗争。
    毛主席号召“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”，担负起“三支”“两军”的伟大历史任务。
    毛主席一声令下，千军万马立即行动。
    四排走上了支农前线。他们遵照毛主席的指示，走到那里，就在那里坚定地支持革命左派；走到那里，就在那里组织贫下中农学习毛主席著作，把光焰无际的毛泽东思想，播种在广大贫下中农的心坎里；走到那里，就同那里的贫下中农一起抓革命促生产，使革命和生产都出现了新气象。贫下中农赞扬他们：千支援，万支援，四排同志给我们送来毛泽东思想是最大的支援。四排立场最坚定，旗帜最鲜明，走过那里红一线，住到那里红一片。
    李文忠来到一个中学执行军训任务。这个学校的革命小将，有强烈的革命精神，大造党内一小撮走资派的反。李文忠坚决支持他们，同他们一起学习毛主席著作，一起战斗。当他们节节胜利的时候，李文忠又给他们每人做了一个语录板，针对他们的活思想，每人选送一条毛主席语录，激励他们永远听毛主席的话，破私立公，不断改造自己，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    英雄的四排最出色的表现还是在江西支左斗争中。
    伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副统帅，今年七月给四排所在的六○一一部队，发出了开赴江西支左的命令。
    列车在祖国辽阔的田野上飞驰。战士们自豪地想起了毛主席的著名词句：
    “此行何去？赣江风雪迷漫处。”
    这时的江西，富有光荣革命传统的井冈山儿女已经充分发动起来了。党内一小撮走资派正在进行最后的挣扎。无产阶级文化大革命处在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战关头。
    四排和它所在的部队一到这里，就坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，坚决保卫左派，坚决支持左派，向党内一小撮走资派发动了总攻击。
    在江西棉纺织印染厂，四排刚刚亮出“群众来访接待站”的牌子，党内一小撮走资派就策动保守势力，向他们展开软硬兼施的进攻。李文忠坚定地叮嘱战友：“我们要顶住风浪，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计！”
    在这里，他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，不怕围攻，敢担风险，坚决同革命左派战斗在一起。他们牢记毛主席“要保护左派”的伟大指示，日日夜夜，顶风冒雨，在工厂周围巡逻，为革命大批判会场站岗。那里左派受到威胁，他们就出现在那里；那里左派遇到困难，他们就赶到那里去支援。左派群众非常感动，紧紧拉住四排战士的手说：“你们真是毛主席派来的亲人，毛主席的好战士！”四排战士说：“毛主席给了我们一颗心，支左只能跟左派亲。”
    南昌的炎夏，车间里热得象火炉一样。英雄四排的战士们，在阶级敌人阴谋破坏生产的时候，整日穿着被汗水浸得透湿的军装，在车间里同革命群众并肩战斗，一起劳动。英雄排长李文忠在车间黑板上写了“抓革命，促生产，坚守生产岗位，严防敌人破坏”十八个大字，鼓励人们多纺纱，多织布，狠狠打击敌人。他带领战士们拜工人为师，学习看机器，接线头。那里活最苦，那里活最累，他们就出现在那里；那里人手少，那里活儿紧，他们就到那里顶班。
    在这里，他们始终把宣传毛泽东思想作为支左工作的根本。不论遇到什么情况，都坚持用光焰无际的毛泽东思想去武装无产阶级革命派，教育受蒙蔽的群众，狠狠打击阶级敌人，推动全厂革命和生产不断向前。
    一个五十多岁的老工人，带着一份记载过去受蒙蔽群众打击他的事实的“账单”，找到四排的战士说：“我要跟他们算账！”战士们接过“账单”一看，拉着他的手说：“不，大爷！这账不能这么算。仇有头，债有主，千笔账，万笔账，都要算到中国赫鲁晓夫头上！受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟，也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，你要帮助他们觉悟过来。”战士们怕老工人还想不通，又拿出自己调查的党内走资派蒙蔽工人的四十条罪状，一条条摆给他听。然后，打开《为人民服务》，和老工人一起朗读：“我们今天已经领导着有九千一百万人口的根据地，但是还不够，还要更大些，才能取得全民族的解放。”老工人恍然大悟，当场摔掉了那份“账单”，表示一定听毛主席的话，对受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟讲团结，做工作，不报复。
    厂里的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，有人开口就是“我们胜利了！”“我们是响当当的造反派！”李文忠看在眼里，想在心里，晚上翻来复去睡不着。他想，现在革命左派中有的同志出现了不好的思想苗头，应该赶快帮助他们用毛泽东思想去克服。第二天，他就和排里的同志一起，组织各车间的革命群众组织负责人学习毛主席的教导：“你们有许多的长处，有很大的功劳，但是你们切记不可以骄傲。你们被大家尊敬，是应当的，但是也容易因此引起骄傲。如果你们骄傲起来，不虚心，不再努力，不尊重人家，不尊重干部，不尊重群众，你们就会当不成英雄和模范了。”毛主席的话深深教育了大家，那些有骄傲自满情绪的人放下了包袱，不断前进。
    伟大统帅毛主席在视察江西等省市无产阶级文化大革命时，亲自听取了英雄四排事迹的汇报，给了英雄四排战士最大的鼓舞，无穷的力量。毛主席发出“要斗私，批修”的伟大号召以来，他们又以最快的步伐，最坚决、最迅速地跟了上来，同广大革命群众一起，办起了毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，推动革命大批判、革命大联合和革命三结合的伟大革命洪流，以不可阻挡的磅礴气势，滚滚向前。
    大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，对伟大的毛泽东思想无限信仰、无限忠诚
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席指出：毛主席是我们时代的代表，是党的代表，是群众的代表，是无产阶级的代表，是群众的领袖，群众的灵魂。
    英雄四排，在无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大年代，所以成为中国人民解放军这座伟大长城上升起的第一面“支左爱民模范排”的光辉旗帜，根本的根本，就是他们对伟大统帅毛主席和毛泽东思想无限信仰，无限忠诚。他们把大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，看作是时代赋予的极其光荣而伟大的任务。
    四排的战士们，在旧社会，几乎家家都讨过饭。是毛主席解放了他们的家乡，他们才从“三座大山”的重压下得到解放。毛主席在他们心里是最大最大的恩人，最亲最亲的亲人。
    他们从带上红领巾的那天起，就立志要做一个忠于毛主席的共产主义接班人。
    他们走进人民解放军这所毛泽东思想的大学校以后，在林副主席高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的光辉榜样的感召和指引下，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的崇高感情，上升到了更高更自觉的境界。
    他们每到一地，办的第一件大事，就是挂起伟大领袖毛主席的像，以便天天看到毛主席。战士们给亲友写信，第一句话是：“最最衷心地敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”他们假日外出，唯一的心愿就是买到心爱的毛主席像章。有时候，他们要移防，驻地革命群众向他们要张相片留念，他们留下的也是毛主席像。他们说：“没有毛主席，就没有我们的一切。我们都要永远热爱毛主席。”
    毛主席的好战士李文忠、李从全、陈佃奎和他们的战友，在文化大革命中，精心特制了一本新影集，里面张张照片都是毛主席。每当报刊上刊出毛主席的照片，他们都怀着无限热爱的感情剪下来，恭恭敬敬地贴到影集里。去年八月，李从全看到报纸上刊登了一幅毛主席身穿军装，检阅文化革命大军的照片，高兴得跳了起来，刚想把它贴进影集，就被房东老大爷要去贴在了炕头上。李从全为了得到这张心爱的毛主席照片，顶着骄阳，步行二十多里，进城去买。他走遍了城里的大小书店，最后才在一本画报上找到。影集成了他们最心爱的珍品。大家带着它爬山涉水去迎接战斗，带着它乘风破浪去争取胜利。他们天天翻看这心爱的影集，每当看到毛主席的伟大形象，就觉着自己到了毛主席身边，从心底里感到无比幸福，浑身是劲。
    去年秋天的一个晚上，四排第一次看到了《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》的电影，看到了天安门前伟大领袖毛主席和革命群众在一起的欢腾景象，激动得久久不能平静。电影放完了很久，四排的宿舍里，还传出一阵阵欢呼：
    毛主席万岁！
    毛主席万万岁！
    副指导员深夜查铺来到四排，只见熟睡的李文忠脸上带着幸福的微笑，颊上挂着激动的泪水，嘴唇在不停地呶动：“毛主席，毛主席……”。
    这睡梦中的轻轻的欢呼，是战士们无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的崇高心声！
    副指导员被这激动人心的情景深深地感动了，回到连部挥笔写了一首诗：
   “…………
    红色太阳在心里，
    战士日夜想念您，
    千言万语合一句，
    万寿无疆毛主席！”
    热爱毛主席，忠于毛主席，就要遵照林副主席“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的指示，用毛泽东思想武装自己，统帅一切。四排同志把活学活用毛主席著作，看作是热爱毛主席、忠于毛主席的最大体现，当作是实现思想革命化的根本途径。
    多少年来，他们任何时候都把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，天天读毛主席的书，雷打不动，走到那里学到那里。英雄排长李文忠给自己的工作规定了一条：干部最大的职责，就是带领大家学好毛主席著作。在这里，新战士入伍接受的第一件武器，是毛主席的宝书；上的第一堂课是《为人民服务》。班长庞朝胜患了眼病，仍然天天坚持读毛主席的书。战友们对他说：“你把眼睛弄坏了咋办？”他说：“一个革命战士，学不好毛主席著作，眼睛再好也是睁眼瞎；只要头脑里有了毛泽东思想，即使眼睛坏了，心里也会透明通亮。”
    在文化大革命的日子里，四排的战士们，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，走向了一个崭新的阶段。排长李文忠在这场极其伟大的革命运动一开始，就勉励大家一定要认真读毛主席的书，学好毛主席在无产阶级专政下进行革命的伟大理论和伟大实践。他送给全排同志每人一个笔记本，让大家专门抄写毛主席有关文化大革命的最新指示，引导大家明确认识无产阶级专政下为什么要革命？革谁的命？怎样革命？庞朝胜和于德祥，在无产阶级文化大革命运动刚刚开始的时候，白天听到一些风言风语，晚上回来就一起在煤油灯下学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》。他们越学心里越亮堂。庞朝胜激动地对于德祥说：“毛主席的话，句句都说到了咱的心坎上。革命的群众运动就是好得很！”
    在支左的日子里，情况千变万化。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争极其尖锐复杂。四排战士们一事当前，都要先带着问题向毛主席请教，“看看毛主席是怎么说的”，然后“坚决照最高指示办”。有一个木厂，情况复杂，两派斗争非常激烈。四排一进去，首先遇到的是怎么办？支持谁？他们带着问题反复学习毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄”和“没有调查就没有发言权”的论述，依靠群众，深入进行调查研究，并且根据毛主席关于阶级分析的教导，透过现象看本质、看主流，很快识别和支持了无产阶级革命派。他们深有感受地说：“支左工作千头万绪，但是，只要向着毛主席指引的方向前进，就是最光明的路，就是必胜的路。”
    毛主席教导说：无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是要解决人们的世界观问题。“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。英雄的四排战士，牢记毛主席的教导，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作，始终把世界观的改造，作为根本目的。
    在一个工厂，四排支持无产阶级革命派以后，党内一小撮走资派勾结保守势力的一些坏头头，煽动受蒙蔽的群众对四排大肆造谣、进行围攻。这是一场针锋相对的斗争。是“敢”字当头，不怕风险，坚持斗争，还是“怕”字当头，屈服于压力，放弃斗争？这是对四排的一次严峻考验。他们反复学习毛主席教导：“在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”“必须站在人民群众这一边，绝不能站到人民敌人那一边去。这是一个马克思列宁主义者的根本立场问题。”毛主席的教导，使他们认识到“怕”字当头，就是“私”字作怪，就是对毛主席的不忠。只有把“私”字斗臭、斗倒，心才红，志才坚，才能有一往无前的战斗精神，打退阶级敌人的进攻。于是，他们以压倒一切的英雄气概，向“私”字展开了猛烈进攻。
    排长李文忠是全排向私字开火的尖兵。他斗私最彻底，斗私最坚决，紧紧掌握两条路线斗争的纲，破大私，立大公。在一次斗“私”大会上，他给“私”字开列了五十八条罪状。一天，他在路上遇到一个无产阶级革命派战士。这位战士亲切地对他说：“好久不见了，我还以为你走了！”这句很普通的话，引起了李文忠的深思。他通过这句话，深挖头脑中的“私”字。意识到自己开始有些脱离群众了。为什么会这样？他边学习毛主席著作，边检查自己，发现自己有了自满的苗头，认为工作局面打开了，可以松口气了，因此，就不象开始那样，时时刻刻注意联系群众了。他觉得，脱离群众，就是对毛主席不忠。他立即到战士中去，亮私心，斗私心，指出有了这种私心，就不能很好地执行毛主席的革命路线。第二天，他就带领大家下车间，更好地和广大革命群众生活在一起，战斗在一起。
    英雄四排的战士，人人都以李文忠为榜样，把破私立公自觉地提到两条路线斗争的高度上来，把是不是自觉地破私立公提到是不是无限忠于毛主席的高度上来。他们的精神境界越来越高，思想革命化出现了一个又一个飞跃。他们深有体会地说：破私立公，要破在要害处，立在根本上。无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，是无产阶级最大的公，我们立公就要立在这个根本上。
    伟大的毛泽东思想哺育了“支左爱民模范排”的英雄。
    英雄爱人民，人民爱英雄。连日来，光荣的井冈山儿女，在欢呼无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好声中，怀着无比崇敬和感激的心情，把一朵朵鲜艳的红花，献给英雄四排。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。
    四排战士牢记林副主席的指示：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”他们以最最崇敬的心情，摘下胸前的红花，敬献在伟大领袖毛主席像的周围。他们从心底里发出欢呼：
    一切光荣归于光焰无际的毛泽东思想！
    一切光荣归于伟大的统帅毛主席！
    我们最最敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
      解放军报记者、新华社通讯员、新华社记者（附图片）
    新战士入伍接受的第一件武器，是毛主席的宝书，上的第一堂课是《为人民服务》。
    李文忠随着“毛主席万岁！”的巨大声浪，一次又一次地潜入水中，一连救起了五个红卫兵和革命群众。
