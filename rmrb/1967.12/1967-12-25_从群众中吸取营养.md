Recently, I participated in a study class organized by the army for cadres and soldiers to study Chairman Mao's thoughts together. I paired up with soldier Yang Meiqi as "a pair of reds," studying Chairman Mao's works together and engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Through this study, I received an education in the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao.

When I first arrived at the study class, I dared not reveal my selfish thoughts in front of the soldiers, fearing that I would lose my "dignity" and find it difficult to carry out my work later. Yang Meiqi's revolutionary spirit of daring to reveal his selfish thoughts and daring to criticize them greatly educated me. I recalled that since Yang Meiqi joined the army, he has been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect, and seriously transforming his worldview. He has been evaluated as an outstanding soldier every year and has become an active participant in studying Chairman Mao's works. Comparing myself to him, there is a world of difference. The difference lies in the fact that I am not as good as the soldiers in actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and my self-awareness in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism is not as high as theirs. I took Yang Meiqi as my example and revealed my selfish thoughts in the study class, asking comrades to criticize and help me. Little Yang and I had a heart-to-heart talk, recalling our past hardships together. He said excitedly, "Comrade Commander, we are like bitter gourds on the same vine. We must never forget our past hardships. Chairman Mao saved us from the sea of suffering, and Mao Zedong Thought nurtured us into glorious Communist Party members and revolutionary soldiers. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, always follow Chairman Mao's words, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life."

Yang Meiqi's words were filled with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and deep concern for his class brothers, making me tearful.

Little Yang also studied the "Three Articles" with me, encouraging me not to rely on past merits but to achieve new feats. He shared with me his three points of experience in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism: (1) Studying Chairman Mao's works with deep class feelings and applying what is learned; (2) Studying a bit, applying a bit, ensuring every point is implemented, and following every sentence; (3) Thoroughly revealing selfish thoughts and fiercely criticizing them, leaving no room for any selfishness. His insights are so correct and profound! I drew nourishment from the soldiers, further strengthening my courage to criticize myself. With Little Yang's help, I used the "Three Articles" as my weapon and took Zhang Zedong as my example, fiercely criticizing my selfish thoughts, throwing away the old burdens on my heart, greatly boosting my revolutionary spirit, and further rooting the thought of serving the public in my mind.

Cadres and soldiers engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism together, inspiring and helping each other, teaching and learning from each other, can accelerate the realization of ideological revolutionization. I will definitely implement the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao in my actions, ensuring that Chairman Mao's revolutionary learning style is forever carried forward.

    从群众中吸取营养
    广州部队某部连长　梁守忠
    最近，我参加了部队举办的干部、战士一起学习的毛泽东思想学习班，和战士杨妹九结成“一对红”，一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修。在学习中，我经受了一次毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风的教育。
    刚到学习班时，我在战士面前不敢亮私心，怕失掉“尊严”，以后不好开展工作。杨妹九敢于亮私心、敢于斗私心的革命精神，给了我很大的教育。我回忆了杨妹九入伍以来，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，认真改造自己的世界观，年年被评为五好战士，成为学习毛主席著作积极分子的情况。对比自己，千差万差，就差在活学活用毛主席著作没有战士好，斗私批修的自觉性没有战士高。我以杨妹九为榜样，在学习班上把自己的私心杂念亮了出来，请同志们批评帮助。小杨和我谈心，一起忆苦思甜。他激动地说：“连长，我们是一根藤上的苦瓜，千万不要忘记过去的苦。毛主席他老人家把我们从苦海里救出来，毛泽东思想哺育我们成为光荣的共产党员和革命战士。我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，永远听毛主席的话，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。”
    杨妹九的话，句句充满了对毛主席的无限忠诚，字字表达了对阶级兄弟的深切关怀，使我感动得热泪盈眶。
    小杨还和我一起学习“老三篇”，勉励我不要吃老本，要立新功，并向我介绍了他斗私批修的三点体会：（一）带着深厚的阶级感情学习毛主席著作，学了就用；（二）学一点，用一点，条条落实，句句照办；（三）彻底亮私心，狠狠斗私心，一丝一毫不放过。他的体会多么正确、多么深刻啊！我从战士身上吸取了营养，更加增强了斗私的勇气。在小杨的帮助下，我以“老三篇”为武器，以张思德为榜样，狠斗私心杂念，丢掉了压在心头的老包袱，革命精神大大振奋，一心为公的思想进一步在头脑里扎下了根。
    干部、战士一起斗私批修，互相启发，互相帮助，互教互学，可以加速实现思想革命化。我一定要把毛主席亲自倡导的这种革命好学风贯彻到行动中去，让毛主席倡导的革命好学风永远发扬光大。
