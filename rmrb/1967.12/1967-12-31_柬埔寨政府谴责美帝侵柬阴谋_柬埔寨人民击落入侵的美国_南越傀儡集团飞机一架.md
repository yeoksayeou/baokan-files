Cambodian Government Denounces U.S. Imperialist Plot to Invade Cambodia
Cambodian People Shoot Down an Invading U.S.-South Vietnamese Puppet Plane

	NEW DELHI, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) — The Cambodian News Agency reported on Dec. 26 that the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement. The statement reaffirmed that if the U.S. aggressor forces create a pretext to invade Cambodian territory, they will face resolute resistance from the Cambodian military and people.

	The Royal Government of Cambodia pointed out in the statement that recent reports from U.S. newspapers revealed that the U.S. command in Vietnam is about to execute a plan to invade Cambodia. Westmoreland “has been given full authority to ‘pursue’ the so-called National Liberation Front and the military of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam that have supposedly fled to Cambodia.”

	The statement said that the pretexts put forward by Washington are identical to those used by Nazi Germany to occupy all of Europe. The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a stern warning to the U.S. government regarding the consequences of U.S. troops invading Cambodian territory.

	The Royal Government of Cambodia announced: “If the U.S. aggressor forces invade Cambodian territory under the pretext of ‘pursuing’ the Vietnamese People’s Army, they will face fierce resistance from the Cambodian military and people. All Cambodian citizens are prepared to fight to defend the independence and territorial integrity of their motherland.”

	The statement said: “Cambodia will immediately appeal to friendly countries for direct assistance and call on volunteers from various countries to join the struggle against the invaders who violate Cambodian sovereignty and all international norms.” The Royal Government of Cambodia hopes that all justice-loving countries will take action against the U.S. government to stop its military aggression against Cambodia.

	NEW DELHI, Dec. 30 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on Dec. 29, two U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet helicopters invaded Cambodian airspace on the afternoon of Dec. 15 and strafed the villages of Kaban and Tatoh in the Sankamesa district of Chantrea province. Local armed villagers fought back and shot down one of the helicopters.

	According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on Dec. 30, two unidentified aircraft from Thailand dropped a bomb on Cambodian territory in the province of Oddar Meanchey on Dec. 8 at noon. On Dec. 10 at noon, another unidentified aircraft from Thailand invaded Cambodian airspace and dropped another bomb in the province of Oddar Meanchey.
