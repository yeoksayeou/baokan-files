New China News Agency, December 14th: Singapore News: In a recent article commemorating the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Malayan newspaper "The People's Forum," published in Singapore, stated that the Soviet people, who have undergone the great test of the October Socialist Revolution and the great test of the anti-fascist patriotic war, will, under the brilliant illumination of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, ultimately bury the Soviet revisionist clique.

The article said: "The fruits of the great October Socialist Revolution led by Lenin have been squandered by the hands of the likes of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin; the proletarian revolutionary cause for which millions of Bolsheviks and Soviet people have shed blood and sacrificed their lives has been thoroughly betrayed by this gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists. This is a painful and severe setback! The serious incident of the Soviet revisionist clique usurping the party, the government, and the military is an extremely serious event in the history of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, and it is an extremely important historical lesson."

The article said: "The great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong has brilliantly summarized the historical experience of the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, summarized the experience of the Soviet revolution, and proposed a complete set of theories and policies to prevent revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism in socialist countries. This is a great, epoch-making achievement, an extremely important development of Marxism-Leninism, and the sharpest weapon for the proletariat in socialist countries to consolidate power, prevent revisionism, and prevent the restoration of capitalism."

The article pointed out that under the brilliant illumination of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the true Bolsheviks in the Soviet Union are also organizing their forces, accumulating revolutionary strength, and preparing to thoroughly bury the Soviet revisionist clique, which is filled with crimes.

The article said: The great Mao Zedong Thought and the unprecedented Chinese proletarian cultural revolution are awakening more and more Soviet people, inspiring and guiding them to take the revolutionary road. The brilliant legacy of the great Lenin and Stalin is something the Soviet revisionist clique cannot extinguish. Although the Soviet revisionist clique is doing everything it can to obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in the Soviet Union, Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the Soviet people, and this is something the Soviet revisionist clique absolutely cannot stop.

　　马来亚《人民论坛》说中国文化大革命鼓舞苏联人民走向革命的道路
　　在马列主义毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下
　　苏联人民必将彻底埋葬苏修叛徒集团
    新华社十四日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《人民论坛》在最近发表的纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年的文章中指出，经受了伟大的十月社会主义革命考验，经受了伟大的反法西斯卫国战争考验的苏联人民，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，终将会把苏修集团彻底埋葬。
    文章说：“由列宁领导的伟大的十月社会主义革命的成果，已断送在赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金一伙人之手；千百万苏联布尔什维克和苏联人民为之流血牺牲的无产阶级革命事业，被这一伙反革命修正主义分子彻底出卖，这是多么惨痛的大倒退啊！苏修集团篡党篡政篡军的严重事件，是无产阶级革命与无产阶级专政史上一件极其严重的事件，是一项极其重要的历史教训。”
    文章说：“伟大的革命导师毛泽东，天才地总结了无产阶级革命与无产阶级专政的历史经验，总结了苏联革命的经验，提出了一整套防止修正主义，防止资本主义在社会主义国家内复辟的理论和政策。这是具有划时代意义的伟大创举，这是对马克思列宁主义的极其重要的发展，是社会主义国家无产阶级巩固政权、防止修正主义、防止资本主义复辟的最锐利的武器。”
    文章指出，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，苏联的真正的布尔什维克也在组织自己的力量，积蓄革命力量，准备彻底埋葬恶贯满盈的苏修集团。
    文章说：伟大的毛泽东思想和史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，正在唤醒越来越多的苏联人民，鼓舞和引导他们走向革命的道路。伟大的列宁和斯大林的光辉是苏修集团熄灭不了的。尽管苏修集团千方百计地阻挠毛泽东思想在苏联的传播，但是，毛泽东思想已日益深入苏联人民的心中，这是苏修集团绝对阻止不住的。
