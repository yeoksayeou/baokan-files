We delivered a portrait of Chairman Mao to the home of a five-guarantee household, Grandma Huang. Overwhelmed with joy, tears streamed down her face as she exclaimed:

“At last, I have brought Chairman Mao home!”

When we were sent to the countryside to support the leftist cause, we brought with us a batch of portraits of Chairman Mao to give to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and we went door to door to hang them up.

When we arrived at the home of 83-year-old five-guarantee household, Grandma Huang, she was listening intently as a neighbor's child read "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to her. Seeing us enter, she stood up and warmly took our hands. We said, “Grandma Huang, we have brought the red sun to you.” She took the portrait of Chairman Mao from our hands, and her hands began to tremble with excitement as she said, “Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, I have been longing to see you day and night. Today, I have finally brought you home!” She then pressed the portrait of Chairman Mao tightly to her chest, and tears of joy streamed down her face. She then urged us, “Quickly hang up the portrait of Chairman Mao, let the whole room be filled with red light.”

As soon as we hung the portrait of Chairman Mao on the north wall, she quickly said, “That's not a good place to hang it, it's too close to the stove and will smoke the portrait of Chairman Mao!” We moved the portrait of Chairman Mao to the south wall to hang it, but she did not allow it, saying that the south wall was a bit darker and one could not clearly see Chairman Mao's radiant face. As we were looking for a new place to hang it, Grandma Huang took out a new broom and pointed to the east wall inside her bed, sweeping as she said, “This is the best place to hang it. As soon as I open my eyes, I can see the reddest red sun in my heart, Chairman Mao.”

After hanging the portrait, Grandma Huang said to us, “Children, you don't know, if it weren't for Chairman Mao, this old body of mine would have long since disappeared. Before liberation, my family had to bow to others' sky and tread on others' land. For 365 days a year, I wandered everywhere. My husband was killed by the Japanese devils during the War of Resistance, and my two children were taken by the 'bandits' (Kuomintang) to dig canals and were worked to death, leaving me, a lonely widow, to beg for food everywhere. It was only after liberation that I returned from outside and everyone helped me build a house, and I finally had a home. The people in the team all care for me, one comes to draw water for me, another comes to ask after my health, and the 'red children' also voluntarily organize themselves to help me study Chairman Mao's works every day. You see, how can I not be grateful to Chairman Mao? These days, many people have told me that Liu Shaoqi wants to cause trouble, opposing Chairman Mao, and saying nonsense like 'the poor like to exploit,' 'exploitation is good.' If I weren't old, I would definitely go find him to argue!”

Grandma Huang's words made us deeply realize that through this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has become even more deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the class consciousness of the masses has been raised to such a great extent. Now, 1967 is coming to an end. In the new year, we must better study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and according to Chairman Mao's teachings, make new contributions in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the cultural revolution.

    我们把毛主席画像送到五保户黄奶奶家，她幸福的热泪夺眶而出，激动地说：
    “可把毛主席盼到家里来了”

    我们奉命到农村支左的时候，带了一批毛主席画像送给贫下中农，并且挨家逐户地去给他们挂上。
    当我们来到八十三岁的五保户黄奶奶家时，她正聚精会神地听着邻居小孩给她读《为人民服务》。她见我们进了家，就起身亲热地抓住我们的手。我们说：“黄奶奶，给您送红太阳来了。”她从我们手中接过毛主席像，两手都抖动起来，激动地说：“毛主席，毛主席，我日日夜夜想见您，今天我可把您盼到家里来了！”接着把毛主席像紧紧地贴在胸前，幸福的热泪夺眶而出。接着，她叮咛我们说：“快把毛主席像挂起来，叫满屋放红光。”
    我们刚把毛主席像朝北面正墙上一挂，她连忙说：“挂那儿不好，离锅太近，会把毛主席像熏着了！”我们把毛主席像移到南墙上来挂，她又不让挂，说南墙光线暗了些，看不清毛主席红光满面的容貌。我们正在找新的地方，老奶奶拿出新扫帚，指着她床里边的东墙，一边打扫一边说：“挂在这儿最好，只要我一睁开眼，就能看到心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。”
    像挂好以后，黄奶奶又对我俩说：“孩子，你们不知道，要不是毛主席他老人家，我这把老骨头早不知哪里去了。解放前，我家头顶的是人家的天，脚踩的是人家的地。一年三百六十五天，天天到处流浪。老伴在抗战时期被日本鬼子打死了，两个孩子被‘刮命党’（国民党）拉去挖河，活活累死了，剩下我孤苦伶仃的一个寡妇到处讨饭。直到解放后，我才从外地回来，大家帮我盖了房子，这才算有了家。队里的人都关心我，这个来替我挑水，那个来问长问短，‘红孩子’也自动组织起来，每天帮助我学习毛主席著作。你们说，这怎么能不叫我感谢毛主席呢？这几天不少人告诉我：说中国赫鲁晓夫想翻天，反对毛主席，胡说什么‘穷人喜欢剥削’，‘剥削有功’，真是狗嘴里吐不出象牙。要不是我年纪大，非要去找他辩论不可！”
    黄奶奶的这席话，使我们深深体会到，通过这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，毛泽东思想已经更加深入人心，群众的阶级觉悟已经得到了多么大的提高。现在，一九六七年即将过去。在新的一年里，我们一定要更好地学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，按照毛主席的教导，在夺取文化大革命的全面胜利的斗争中，作出新的贡献。
