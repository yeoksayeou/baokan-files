In the young Vietnamese People's Air Force, the name Nguyen Van Bach is well-known. This hero, who has struck down the American air pirates with such ferocity that their heads and tails are broken, has shot down four American planes with four cannon shots. People affectionately call him the "Red Star on the Silver Swallow."

Early this year, his squadron received orders to take off. It was late afternoon, the monsoon had briefly subsided, and the sky was clear. Fluffy white and grayish-white clouds formed undulating ridges in the sky. In the distance, a group of American "Thunderchief" pirate planes used the dense clouds to sneak in and attack target X. Upon discovering the enemy, Nguyen Van Bach and his comrades immediately climbed, seizing a favorable position. All around, an unknown number of "Phantom" planes swarmed in to provide cover for these "Thunderchief" planes.

Nguyen Van Bach and his comrades lightly maneuvered the "Silver Swallow" and immediately launched a fierce attack on the enemy. Those "Thunderchief" planes, seeing the situation was not in their favor, hastily dumped all their bombs and fled to the outer circle. At this moment, anti-aircraft guns on the ground opened fire, creating a dense net of fire in the sky. The enemy, seeing this, was terrified and dared not fly low, forced to circle in the high sky. Inside, there were still four enemy planes. They were unwilling to leave target X, hoping to find an opportunity for a surprise attack. However, the enemy's plot did not succeed. Q comrade accelerated, catching up with the last enemy plane, and "lured" it out of formation, allowing T comrade, who was following behind, to fire fiercely. With a cannon shot, the enemy plane suddenly shook, seemingly injured but still flying towards the sea, attempting to escape. At this moment, Nguyen Van Bach immediately did a roll, cutting off the enemy's escape route and tightly following its tail. This cunning enemy, trying to avoid danger, used an unpredictable flight path, rolling left and right, suddenly climbing, and suddenly diving. However, a thick-skinned person meets a sharp nail, and Nguyen Van Bach was even more skilled, quickly "riding" on the enemy plane and fiercely opening fire. Following the streaks of fire, Nguyen Van Bach saw the enemy plane's canopy shattered, a flame igniting, and the American pilot, unable to jump out in time, crashed to the ground with the plane!

On one day in April, Nguyen Van Bach, along with his comrades, soared in the clear sky of his motherland. Suddenly, American pirate planes intruded into the airspace to cause trouble again. The number of enemy planes was several times more than theirs, all "Phantom" planes. They did not carry bombs on their bodies. Seeing Nguyen Van Bach and his comrades, they swarmed in. It was clear that this time, they were not intending to bomb any ground targets but were foolishly trying to challenge the brave Vietnamese People's Air Force.

Sure enough, as soon as they spotted Nguyen Van Bach and his comrades, the enemy launched an attack. They continuously fired missiles from a distance, and the sky was crisscrossed with trails of fire. However, Nguyen Van Bach and his comrades skillfully dodged the enemy's missiles time and time again. The enemy was now both tense and furious, some beginning to fear and wanting to escape. At this moment, Nguyen Van Bach and his comrades pounced on the enemy. M comrade seized the opportunity to fire at an enemy plane, and this fellow quickly dove down. L comrade chased after it and fired two bursts of machine guns. The enemy plane desperately tried to climb. But it did not expect that Nguyen Van Bach's "Silver Swallow" was already waiting for it above. The enemy plane, upon seeing Nguyen Van Bach, panicked and tried to escape again. But it was too late; Nguyen Van Bach kept a close eye on it, and the enemy plane's shadow quickly filled Nguyen Van Bach's sight. Three bursts of vengeful cannon shells were fired at the enemy, and that enemy plane immediately exploded, turning into fragments.

At this moment, the sky was clear, and the sun was shining brightly. The wreckage of the downed enemy plane lay burned on the ground. An indescribable fighting spirit surged in the hearts of the young and brave air force soldiers. What could be more fortunate and joyful than fighting for the glorious cause of defending the motherland and the people! After this battle, another red star, symbolizing glorious achievements, was added to Nguyen Van Bach's "Silver Swallow."

    “银燕上的红星”
    ——记越南人民空军战斗英雄阮文百的事迹
    在年轻的越南人民空军中，阮文百的名字，是大家所熟悉的。这个把美国空中强盗打得头断尾掉的战斗英雄，曾经四次开炮击落四架美国飞机。人们亲昵地称他是“银燕上的红星”。
    今年年初，他的编队受令出击。这天正是下午光景，季候风稍停，天空晴朗。一朵朵白色的和灰白色的云彩在空中垒成蜿蜒起伏的山峦。远处，一群美国“雷公”式强盗飞机，利用浓云，分批来偷袭×目标。发现了敌人后，阮文百和他的战友马上跃升，占据有利地位。四周，不知其数的一大批“鬼怪”式飞机蜂拥而来，为这些“雷公”式飞机打掩护。
    阮文百和战友们轻驾“银燕”立即向敌人发动猛烈的攻击。那些“雷公”式飞机见势不妙，就急忙把全部炸弹统统扔掉，并逃到外圈。这时，地上的对空枪炮一齐开火，在天空中组成密密麻麻的火网。敌人一看心惊胆战，不敢低飞，只好在高空打转。里层还有四架敌机，它们野心未死，不愿离开×目标，想找机会来个出其不意的攻击。但是，敌人的阴谋没有得逞。Q同志加快速度追上敌机的最后一架，并把它“诱”出队形，让后边赶来的T同志猛烈地射击。随着炮声一响，敌机突然摇晃了一下，看样子，可能它受了伤，但仍向大海那边飞去，企图逃跑。这时，阮文百马上作个翻滚，切断敌人逃路，并紧紧咬住它的尾巴。这个狡猾的敌人想摆脱危险，采用了变化无常的航线，它左翻右翻，腾地跃升，腾地下滑，可是厚桔子皮碰尖指甲，阮文百比它还高明，很快地“骑上”敌机狠狠地开炮。顺着一道道火光，阮文百看见敌机座舱盖儿被打碎了，一股火焰燃起，那个美国飞贼来不及跳安全伞，就连机带人一个劲儿栽地了！
    四月的一天，阮文百又一次同战友一起，驾机翱翔在祖国晴朗的天空。突然美国强盗飞机又窜进领空来捣乱了。敌机数量比他们多好几倍，都是“鬼怪”式飞机。它们机身没带炸弹。一见阮文百他们就蜂拥而来。很清楚，它们这次不是要轰炸地面上的什么目标，是妄想来碰一碰英勇的越南人民空军的。
    果然，一发现阮文百他们，敌人就进行攻击了。它们从远处接连发射导弹，半空中一道道火线纵横交错着，可是阮文百和他的战友们一次又一次巧妙地闪开敌人的导弹。敌人这时又紧张又恼火，有的开始害怕，想逃跑了。就在这时，阮文百和他的战友向敌人猛扑过去。M同志抓住时机向一架敌机开火，这个家伙忙向下滑。L同志追上去连打两排机关炮。敌机又竭力上升。可它没想到阮文百的“银燕”早在上边“等着”它。敌机一发现阮文百，慌了手脚，又想逃跑。但是来不及了，阮文百紧盯住不放，敌机的影子很快地遮满了阮文百的光环里。三排仇恨的炮弹向敌人射去，那架敌机立即爆炸，粉身碎骨了。
    这时，晴空万里，阳光绚烂。被击落的敌机残骸软瘫在地上燃烧着。一种难以形容的战斗豪情涌上年轻英勇空军战士的心头。还有什么能比为保卫祖国、保卫人民的壮丽事业更幸福，更高兴的呢！这次战斗结束后，阮文百的“银燕”上，又添了一颗标志辉煌战功的红星。
