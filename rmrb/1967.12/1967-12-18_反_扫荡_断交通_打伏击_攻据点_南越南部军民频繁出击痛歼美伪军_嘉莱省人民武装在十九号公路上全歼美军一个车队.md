	The people's armed forces in the southern region of South Vietnam have continued to advance and strike back at the enemy, inflicting heavy casualties on the U.S. and puppet forces in various areas.

	On December 8, the people's liberation armed forces in the military support zone east of Binh Duong Province, about one kilometer northeast of Bu Dang, annihilated a battalion of the U.S. First Infantry Division. They destroyed eight cannons and mortars and seized a large number of weapons and military supplies.

	Previously, on the night of December 2, the people's liberation armed forces in Binh Duong Province captured the Thuan Duc stronghold near Ba Ra Town, killing nearly 100 enemy soldiers. On December 4, the enemy sent two security companies to "sweep" the area. The people's liberation armed forces, undaunted, annihilated these two companies.

	According to reports, the people's liberation armed forces in Binh Dinh Province have been very active recently. In just two days, on December 7 and 8, they continuously attacked enemy strongholds along the roads and in the cities of Binh Dinh and Phu Cat, killing and wounding nearly 300 U.S. and puppet soldiers, capturing and forcing the enemy to withdraw from nine strongholds, and destroying many enemy warehouses and barracks.

	Another report stated that the people's liberation armed forces in Dinh Tuong Province have also fought well. On December 8, the people's liberation armed forces in Phu Lien County and Xuan Buong Commune foiled an enemy "sweep," killing and wounding more than 400 puppet soldiers, including a puppet army major, shooting down three helicopters, and damaging several more. The enemy, unwilling to accept defeat, gathered nearby security forces and self-defense forces to rescue Xuan Buong Commune, but the rescue forces were also heavily attacked by the people's liberation armed forces.

	This news agency also reported that the people's liberation armed forces in Tien Giang Province, near the U.S. and puppet regime's control center, simultaneously attacked the enemy's camp in De Hoa District and Canh Buong Commune, the De Hoa military support zone, the Kinh San stronghold, and the Cau Ca stronghold on the night of November 28. They killed more than 200 enemy soldiers, including six U.S. invaders and Filipino mercenaries, destroyed five outposts and bunkers, shot down one reconnaissance plane, three armored vehicles, and three cannons and mortars.

	According to reports from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the people's liberation armed forces in Gia Lai Province again annihilated a U.S. invasion force convoy on National Route 19 on December 4, destroying 70 transport vehicles, tanks, and armored vehicles, killing and wounding nearly 200 U.S. aggressors, and shooting down one plane.

	This is the second time in eleven days that the people's liberation armed forces in Gia Lai Province have annihilated a U.S. invasion force convoy on National Route 19. In an ambush on November 24, the people's liberation armed forces destroyed 68 enemy vehicles of various types and killed 180 U.S. soldiers.

	The report said that, having been defeated in the previous battle, the enemy convoy was even more frightened this time. When the convoy left the An Khe base and crawled to a point 18 kilometers west of An Khe, it fell into the encirclement of the people's liberation armed forces. The soldiers of the people's liberation armed forces blocked both ends of the convoy and bravely charged, completely annihilating the enemy convoy in just half an hour of fighting.

    新华社河内十五日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方南部地区各省人民解放武装力量乘胜前进，最近继续在各地痛击美伪军，歼灭大量敌人有生力量。
    十二月八日，人民解放武装力量在边和省步笃军事支区东北一公里的地方，一举歼灭美国第一步兵师的一个营，击毁大炮和迫击炮共八门，缴获许多武器和军用物资。
    在这之前，边和省人民解放武装力量二日深夜还攻克了巴拉镇附近的得逊据点，消灭敌人近一百名。四日，敌人派了两个保安连前往“扫荡”。人民解放武装力量再接再厉，全歼了这两个连。
    据报道，槟椥省人民解放武装力量最近十分活跃，仅七日和八日两天中，就接连袭击了槟椥市、楳棋县城和公路沿线许多敌人据点，共打死打伤美伪军近三百名，攻克和迫使敌人撤出据点九个，并摧毁敌人许多仓库和营房。
    另据报道，迪石省人民解放武装力量也打得很好。在八日，人民解放武装力量在榕莲县和兴乡粉碎了敌人的一次“扫荡”，打死打伤伪军四百多名，其中包括打死一名伪军少校指挥官，击落直升飞机三架，击伤多架。敌人不甘心失败，曾纠集附近的保安队和民卫队前往和兴乡救援，但是救援的敌军也遭到人民解放武装力量的痛击。
    这家通讯社还报道，靠近美伪集团统治中心的堤岸省人民解放武装力量在十一月二十八日夜间，同时袭击了德和县和庆乡的一个伪军营的驻地、德和军事支区、京桑据点和沟卡等据点。共消灭敌人二百多名，其中有美国侵略军和菲律宾帮凶军六名，拔除哨所和碉堡五个，击毁侦察机一架、装甲车三辆、大炮和迫击炮三门。
    新华社河内十六日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方嘉莱省人民解放武装力量四日又在第十九号公路上全歼美国侵略军的一个车队，击毁运输车、坦克和装甲车共七十辆，打死打伤美国强盗近二百名，击落飞机一架。
    这是嘉莱省的人民解放武装力量十一天内在十九号公路上第二次消灭美国侵略军的车队。在十一月二十四日的一次伏击战中，人民解放武装力量击毁敌人各种军车六十八辆，歼灭美军一百八十名。
    报道说，敌人由于在上次挨打，这次车队出发时更加心惊胆战。当车队从安溪基地出发，爬行到距安溪以西十八公里的地方的时候，又陷入人民解放武装力量的包围圈。人民解放武装力量战士堵住了车队的两头，勇猛冲锋，只经过半小时的战斗就完全消灭了敌人的车队。
