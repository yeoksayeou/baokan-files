Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: The Syrian Umayyad Folk Art Troupe from the Syrian Arab Republic held its first performance in Beijing this evening during their visit to China. Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress attended the performance.

Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Chu Tu-nan, and the leader of the Umayyad Folk Art Troupe, Yusuf Shakra, spoke at the opening ceremony.

Chu Tu-nan, in his speech, thanked the troupe for bringing the deep friendship of the Syrian people to the Chinese people. He highly praised the struggle of the Syrian Arab people against the aggression of American imperialism and Israel. He said, "The great Arab people are invincible. The Chinese people, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, have always firmly supported the just struggle of the Arab people against American and Israeli aggression. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our people will certainly be able to support the revolutionary struggles of the Arab people and the people of the world even more powerfully."

Shakra, the leader of the troupe, said, "We are honored to visit your country during the great proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao. We convey the respect of the Syrian people to the Chinese government and people who have always supported the struggles of revolutionary peoples."

He said, "The struggle of the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao has educated us. We must stand the test, rely on our own strength, and adhere to principles. We have rejected all compromises and rejected the resolution of the United Nations Security Council that asked us to surrender. We firmly believe in people's war and believe that we will definitely recover our lost lands by force. Victory will surely belong to the Arab people."

Tonight, the Syrian art troupe, with great enthusiasm, re-enacted the struggle of the Arab people against American imperialism and Israel, and sang the praises of the Arab people's fighting spirit. One of their main performances reflected how the war had educated the Arab people, making them realize that American imperialism and Israel were their enemies. The people took up arms and finally drove out the invaders, returning to their beloved homes.

The Syrian friends also enthusiastically performed songs and dances in praise of Chairman Mao, which they had learned since coming to China. They performed songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely Determine" and "The Core Force Leading Our Cause." The performers, holding red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang Mao's quotations loudly. The dancers danced "Long Live Chairman Mao" in front of the radiant portrait of Chairman Mao, expressing their ardent love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The Syrian friends also performed Syrian folk songs and dances tonight.

At the end of the performance, the actors raised the national flags of both countries, sang "The East Is Red," and, together with the audience, repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

After the performance, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo went on stage to warmly congratulate the successful performance. During the intermission, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo met with Shakra, the leader of the troupe, Deputy Leader Qudsi, and the main members of the troupe, and had a friendly and cordial conversation with them. Today, those who attended the performance also included Ji Pengfei, Zhou Yiping, and other relevant officials. The Syrian Arab Republic's Ambassador to China, Sadiq, accompanied them to watch the performance.
