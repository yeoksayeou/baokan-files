Title: The More They Paint, the Blacker It Gets

After the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on the Middle East issue, the Soviet revisionist clique immediately activated their propaganda machine to desperately justify their treacherous actions.

Moscow's *Pravda* and *Izvestia* successively published commentaries, loudly proclaiming that the Security Council had "formed" a "united front" among all parties during the discussion of this resolution. They also boasted that the passage of this resolution would force Israel to immediately withdraw its troops from Arab countries, thereby causing the "plans" of the United States and Israel to "fail"...

Their words are flowery, but they are all lies.

If the Security Council's resolution was truly a "blow" to the United States and Israel, then why did the United States not only vote in favor but also publicly declare that this resolution is "in line with the policy of the United States represented by Johnson"? After this resolution was passed, why did Israel express satisfaction and welcome it?

In fact, this resolution did not stipulate that the Israeli aggressors must immediately withdraw unconditionally, but rather demanded that the Arab countries accept a series of humiliating conditions. As Arab public opinion pointed out, this resolution is a great "reward" for the Israeli aggressors. No wonder the Israeli aggressors arrogantly declared: the Security Council's resolution "does not mean that Israel will change its policy of... staying in the occupied territories"; Israel has obtained the "recognition" and "understanding of the world," and before "redrawing the borders," it has the "right" to "continue staying on the ceasefire line of the June War."

The arrogant attitude of the Tel Aviv authorities, demanding more and more, is it not the result of the Security Council's resolution indulging them? Is it not a resounding slap in the face of the Soviet revisionist clique?

Just as the Soviet revisionist clique was desperately trying to cover up their shameful betrayal of the Arab people, the American *Newsweek* revealed the situation of Khrushchev's recent secret collusion with Johnson on the Middle East issue. This American magazine said that before the Security Council passed the resolution, Khrushchev, in a "secret letter" written to Johnson in "reconciliatory language," expressed the "desire to improve relations with the United States." This secret letter not only did not make the withdrawal of Israeli troops a precondition, did not "demand that Israel compensate the Arab countries," but also did not call Israel an "aggressor." This shows that the Soviet revisionist clique's sudden withdrawal of their own proposal in the Security Council and their subsequent support for the "British proposal," thus quickly finalizing this dirty deal, was the result of secret collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States. The so-called "united front" in the Security Council, as hyped by Soviet revisionist newspapers, is nothing but another ugly performance of the counter-revolutionary "joint action" between Moscow and Washington!

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: The reactionaries "not only need to deceive others, but also need to deceive themselves, otherwise they cannot live."

The Soviet revisionist clique is racking their brains to cover up their despicable actions of betraying the Arab people and to whitewash their traitorous faces, but the result is that the more they cover up, the more exposed they become, and the more they paint, the blacker it gets. Their praise of the Security Council's resolution can only make the broad Arab people and people of the world more clearly see: the Soviet revisionist clique is a genuine accomplice of American imperialism.

    愈描愈黑
    联合国安理会通过关于中东问题的决议以后，苏修集团立即开动宣传机器，竭力为他们的叛卖勾当进行辩解。
    莫斯科《真理报》和《消息报》接连发表评论，大肆宣扬安理会在讨论这个决议时“形成了”各方面一致的“共同阵线”；并且吹嘘说，这个决议的通过，将迫使以色列立即从阿拉伯国家的领土上撤退军队，因而它使得美国和以色列的“打算遭到了破产”……。
    说得天花乱坠，其实完全是胡诌。
    如果安理会的决议真是对美国和以色列的“打击”，那么为什么美国不仅投票赞成，而且公开宣称这个决议是“符合于约翰逊所代表的美国的政策”呢？在这个决议通过以后，为什么以色列心满意足地表示欢迎呢？
    事实上，这个决议根本就没有规定以色列侵略者必须立即无条件撤军，却要阿拉伯国家接受一连串屈辱的条件。正如阿拉伯舆论所指出的，这个决议对以色列侵略者是一个很大的“奖励”。无怪乎以色列侵略者狂妄地叫嚷：安理会的决议“并不意味着，以色列要改变它……继续呆在被占领的领土的政策”；以色列已得到联合国的“承认”和“世界的谅解”，在重新“划定边界之前”，它有“继续留在六月战争停火线上的权利”。
    特拉维夫当局这种得寸进尺的嚣张气焰，难道不正是安理会决议纵容的结果？不也正是给苏修集团一记响亮的耳光吗？
    恰恰就在苏修集团拚命掩饰自己对阿拉伯人民的可耻背叛的时候，美国《新闻周刊》透露了柯西金同约翰逊最近在中东问题上进行新的秘密勾结的情况。这家美国杂志说，在安理会通过决议之前，柯西金在一封“以和解语言”写给约翰逊的“秘密信件”中，表示了“要想改善同美国关系的愿望”。这封密信，不但没有把以色列撤军作为先决条件，没有“要求以色列向阿拉伯国家付出赔偿”，而且没有把以色列称为“侵略者”。这就说明，苏修集团在安理会中突然撤销自己的提案，转而支持“英国提案”，从而使这笔肮脏的买卖迅速拍板成交，正是苏美之间暗中勾搭的结果。苏修报纸的评论大肆渲染的所谓安理会中的“共同阵线”，不过是莫斯科和华盛顿之间的反革命“联合行动”又一次丑恶表演而已！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：反动派“不但需要欺骗别人，也需要欺骗他们自己，不然他们就不能过日子。”
    苏修集团挖空心思，想要掩饰他们出卖阿拉伯人民的卑鄙勾当，粉饰自己的叛徒嘴脸，结果却是欲盖弥彰，愈描愈黑。他们对安理会决议的吹捧，只能使广大的阿拉伯人民和全世界人民更加认清：苏修集团是美帝国主义的不折不扣的帮凶。
