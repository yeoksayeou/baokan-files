	Putting Chairman Mao's latest instructions into action, cadres and masses together fight self and criticize revisionism to accelerate thought revolutionization.

	Broad revolutionary cadres determine to put aside their airs, learn from the masses, and transform themselves in the midst of the masses' struggles to raise revolutionary consciousness.

	The People's Liberation Army units implement Chairman Mao's combat orders to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldier participation.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres across the country enthusiastically acclaim and seriously study the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao, "Military study classes must include soldiers." They say that Chairman Mao's great instructions are of extremely great significance for the entire Party, the entire country, and the entire military to further improve cadre-mass relations and accelerate the thought revolutionization of cadres and masses. Cadres old and new from various places have expressed that they will definitely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions without any deviation, whether in study classes or at work, and will humbly learn from the masses, forever being the masses' little students.

	Revolutionary cadres old and new and revolutionary masses from various places across the country have enthusiastically discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions. They excitedly say that in our hearts, the reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, trusts the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, and respects the masses' pioneering spirit the most, forever being heart to heart with the revolutionary masses. To learn from the masses, from the masses to the masses, is Chairman Mao's consistent great thought and our Party and military's revolutionary tradition. At this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories nationwide, Chairman Mao's great instructions are major measures to solve the cadre issue starting from education. At the same time, it points out the direction for cadre education. We will definitely implement it. Revolutionary leading cadres from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places say that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest education, and greatest spur for broad revolutionary cadres. In the socialist revolution period, ensuring the thought revolutionization of cadres at all levels is the primary issue of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must forever keep the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings in mind, forever be the masses' little students, and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution. Revolutionary leading cadres from the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory in Shanxi Province excitedly say that the struggle practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past year has proven that revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the most loyal to Chairman Mao, the most loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the most intelligent, the bravest, and the most creative. A revolutionary cadre can only follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, put aside airs, learn from the masses, and learn from the masses, and in the midst of the masses' struggles, constantly cleanse the mud and dirt in one's mind, to raise one's consciousness of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to forever maintain revolutionary youth.

	"The masses are the true heroes." "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." Cadres old and new from various places, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the editorial "Forever Be the Masses' Little Students" from the *Liberation Army Daily*, have discussed their gains and experiences from fighting self and criticizing revisionism together with the masses, and promoting revolution and production. They say that Chairman Mao's instructions on the mass line are the most brilliant and correct. Maintaining constant and close contact with revolutionary masses can boost morale, increase vigor, and provide more solutions. Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Nayong County, Guizhou Province, Yang Wenquan, recently participated in a Mao Zedong Thought study class with workers, cooks, and communication personnel. He said: Cadres studying together with the masses, fighting self and criticizing revisionism together, under the masses' help and supervision, can make the "self" in one's mind shine brightly and be fought deeply. This is an important path to accelerate the thought revolutionization of cadres. Revolutionary cadres from the Tianjin Cotton Textile Mill, studying and promoting revolution and production together with worker masses, fighting self and criticizing revisionism together, have received profound education and strengthened their relations with the masses. They deeply feel that cadres must go to the masses, be the masses' little students, and never leave the masses to realize thought revolutionization, to do a good job in revolution and production. Responsible person of the preparatory committee of the Revolutionary Committee of Hangzhou City, former Mayor of Hangzhou City, Wang Zida said: Over the past few months, I often go to factories and schools, study and discuss with revolutionary masses, and have received great help from the masses. Practice has proven that floating above, not following the mass line, will lead to mistakes; discussing with the masses on every matter will provide more solutions and make work smoother. The two most important things for us to do a good job are to study Chairman Mao's works actively and to follow the mass line. These two things must never be forgotten for a moment.

	Revolutionary masses from various places studying together with revolutionary cadres in Mao Zedong Thought study classes say that studying together with revolutionary cadres can help us better understand, help, and cherish cadres, better learn from cadres, and strengthen the unity between cadres and masses, jointly shoulder the two burdens of revolution and production. Revolutionary masses from the New China Printing Factory in Henan Province say that the old and new revolutionary cadres in our factory study Chairman Mao's works together with us, fight self and criticize revisionism together, and labor together, further strengthening the cadre-mass relations, promoting revolution and production, and driving the entire factory to complete the honorable task of printing the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* this year ahead of schedule and overfulfilling the quota.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The People's Liberation Army, loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao, is implementing Chairman Mao's great combat order, "Military study classes must include soldiers," with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, swiftly establishing and further improving Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldier participation. Broad cadres determine to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, humbly learn from soldiers, be the masses' little students, and make great strides in the road of thought revolutionization, making our army forever the steel wall of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, defending the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	While seriously studying and deeply understanding the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, various units have implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the most enthusiastic political spirit and swift action. Many units' leading organs have convened party committee meetings overnight, issued notices, and made decisions, determined to further establish and improve Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldier participation. The leading organs of the Beijing, Shenyang, Guangzhou units, and the Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Shanxi Military Regions, as well as the Railway Engineering Corps Party Committee, on the day Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, immediately sent out notices to their subordinate units regarding the immediate implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The notices from various units' leading organs emphasize that Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the participation of leading cadres, general cadres, and soldiers must be swiftly established. For study classes that have already been established but do not include soldiers, soldiers must be immediately absorbed; for study classes established in the future at all levels, soldiers must be absorbed; for units that have already established study classes with the participation of cadres and soldiers, experiences must be seriously summarized and exchanged to make such study classes better in the future. The notice from the Beijing unit's leading organ also requires various units to select outstanding soldiers to participate in the leadership of study classes and calls on various organs' study classes to be moved to the companies. Many units in the Inner Mongolia Military Region, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have swiftly absorbed many Five-Good Soldiers into the various levels of cadre Mao Zedong Thought study classes that are being held, studying together with cadres and jointly fighting self and criticizing revisionism, making the study classes present a new atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. Various units, to swiftly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, during the Four-Good Assessment in companies, have also mobilized soldiers to participate in cadres' summary meetings of studying Chairman Mao's works, helping cadres fight self and criticize revisionism.

	Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "Military study classes must include soldiers," have reached various units that have already established Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldier participation according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Broad officers and soldiers have been greatly inspired, enthusiastically discussing their gains from study, summarizing experiences of running such study classes well, and determining to use Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline to run the study classes of cadres and soldiers studying together even better. The Party Committee of the Air Force in Chengdu convened an overnight party committee meeting on the 12th, seriously studied the editorial "Forever Be the Masses' Little Students" from the *Liberation Army Daily*, summarized the experiences of the previous period of establishing study classes, studied measures to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and various levels of party committees have placed the task of running well the study classes of cadres and soldiers studying together in an important position, assigned specific persons to be in charge, and combined with the year-end assessment, launched a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The Party Committee of a certain unit in the Beijing unit, to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, in the expanded party committee meeting with the participation of general cadres and company soldiers, seriously summarized the experiences of the previous stage of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldier participation, proposed that in the future, such study classes must not only include soldiers from the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" frontline but also absorb soldiers who have long been guarding their posts in companies, making cadres better and more broadly learn from soldiers. Broad cadres studying together with soldiers in Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the Guangzhou, Lanzhou, Chengdu units, combined with their personal experiences, summarized the gains and experiences of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes with soldier participation. They unanimously believe that to make our army's tradition of officers and soldiers being united and upper and lower being united pass down from generation to generation, cadres at all levels forever not leaving the masses, and forever maintaining the style of an ordinary soldier, such study classes must be persistently run and run to a new level.

    据新华社十三日讯　全国广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部，热烈欢呼、认真学习我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的最新指示。他们说，毛主席的伟大指示，对于全党全国全军进一步搞好干群关系，加速干部群众的思想革命化，有着极其重大的意义。各地新老革命干部表示，一定不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，无论在学习班里还是在工作岗位上，都要虚心向群众学习，永远做群众的小学生。
    全国各地广大新老革命干部和革命群众热烈地畅谈了毛主席这一光辉指示的伟大意义。他们兴奋地说，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，最相信群众，最依靠群众，最尊重群众的首创精神，永远和革命群众心连心。做群众的小学生，向人民群众学习，从群众中来，到群众中去，是毛主席一贯的伟大思想，是我党我军的革命传统。在全国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时刻，毛主席发出的这一伟大指示，是当前从教育着手解决干部问题的重大措施，同时给我们指明了干部教育的方向，我们坚决贯彻执行。北京、上海等地许多革命领导干部说，毛主席的最新指示，是对广大革命干部的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大教育，最大鞭策。在社会主义革命时期，保证各级领导干部思想革命化，是反修、防修，巩固无产阶级专政的首要问题。我们要永远把伟大领袖毛主席的教导铭记心间，永远做群众的小学生，永远紧跟毛主席干革命。山西太原重型机器厂的革命领导干部激动地说，一年多来的文化大革命的斗争实践证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众，最忠于毛主席，最忠于毛主席的革命路线，最聪明、最勇敢、最有创造性。一个革命的领导干部只有遵循毛主席的伟大教导，放下架子，拜群众为师，向群众学习，在群众斗争的风浪中不断地涤荡头脑里的污泥浊水，才能提高自己在无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的自觉性，才能永葆革命青春。
    “群众是真正的英雄”。“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”各地新老革命干部在学习毛主席的最新指示，学习《解放军报》社论《永远做群众的小学生》时，畅谈了他们和群众在一起斗私批修，一起抓革命促生产的收获和体会。他们说，毛主席关于群众路线的指示，最英明，最正确。同革命群众保持经常的、密切的联系，就能斗志旺，干劲足，办法多。贵州省纳雍县革命委员会副主任委员杨文权，不久前和工人、炊事员、通讯员一起参加毛泽东思想学习班学习。他说：干部和群众一起学习，一起斗私批修，在群众的帮助和监督下，头脑里的“私”字，就亮得彻底，斗得深刻，这是加速干部思想革命化的重要途径。天津市麻纺织厂的革命干部同工人群众一起学习，一起抓革命、促生产，一起斗私批修，受到了深刻的教育，密切了和群众的关系。他们深有体会地说，干部要实现思想革命化，把革命和生产搞好，必须到群众中去，做群众的小学生，一刻也不脱离群众。杭州市革命委员会筹备小组负责人、原杭州市市长王子达说：几个月来，我经常到工厂、学校去，和革命群众同学习、共商量，得到了群众很大帮助。实践证明，浮在上面，不走群众路线，就要犯错误；遇事和群众商量，办法就多，工作就顺利。我们做好工作最重要的有两条，一条是活学活用毛主席著作，一条是走群众路线，这两条一时一刻也不能忘记。
    各地同革命干部一起在毛泽东思想学习班学习的革命群众说，和革命干部一起学习，能够使我们更好地了解干部，帮助干部，爱护干部，更好地向干部学习，把干部和群众的团结搞得更紧密，共同挑起革命和生产两副担子。河南新华印刷厂的革命群众说，我们厂的新老革命干部和我们共同学习毛主席著作，共同斗私批修，共同劳动，进一步密切了干群关系，促进了革命和生产，推动全厂提前超额完成了今年印制《毛泽东选集》的光荣任务。
    据新华社十三日讯　无限忠于伟大统帅毛主席的人民解放军陆海空三军各部队，遵照毛主席“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的伟大战斗号令，正以最大的热情，最快的速度，雷厉风行地大办和进一步办好有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班。广大干部决心遵照毛主席的教导，虚心地向战士学习，当群众的小学生，在思想革命化的道路上突飞猛进，使我军永远成为反修防修、保卫无产阶级专政的钢铁长城。
    各部队在认真学习、深刻领会毛主席最新指示的伟大意义的同时，以最饱满的政治热情，雷厉风行地贯彻落实毛主席的最新指示。许多部队的领导机关连夜召开党委会，发通知、作决定，决心进一步大办、办好有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班。北京、沈阳、广州等部队和内蒙古、青海、山西军区领导机关以及铁道兵党委，在毛主席最新指示发表的当天，就分别向所属各部队发出了关于立即贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的通知。各部队领导机关的通知强调指出，要雷厉风行地迅速举办有领导干部、一般干部和战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班。凡是已经举办而还没有战士参加的学习班，必须立即吸收战士参加；以后举办的各级毛泽东思想学习班，都要吸收战士参加；已经举办了干部、战士一起参加的毛泽东思想学习班的部队，要认真总结和交流经验，以便今后把这样的学习班办得更好。北京部队领导机关的通知，还要求各部队选拔优秀的战士参加学习班的领导工作，并号召各机关的学习班搬到连队去办。内蒙古军区许多部队，一边学习毛主席的最新指示，一边行动，迅速吸收许多五好战士到正在举办的各级干部毛泽东思想学习班，和干部一起学习，共同斗私批修，使学习班出现了团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的新气象。各部队为了迅速落实毛主席最新指示，在连队进行四好总评时，还发动战士参加干部总结学习毛主席著作的会议，帮助干部斗私批修。
    毛主席关于“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的最新指示，传到已经按照毛主席这一最新指示举办了有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班的各部队，广大指战员受到极大的鼓舞，纷纷畅谈学习收获，总结办好这种学习班的经验，决心以毛泽东思想为指针，把干部战士同学习的学习班办得好上加好。驻沪空军党委十二日连夜召开党委会议，认真学习了《解放军报》《永远做群众的小学生》的社论，总结了前一时期举办学习班的经验，研究进一步贯彻落实毛主席最新指示的措施，各级党委都把办好干部和战士一起学习的毛泽东思想学习班摆在重要位置，由专人负责，并结合年终总评，掀起一个学习毛主席最新指示的高潮。北京部队某部党委为了落实毛主席的最新指示，在吸收一般干部和连队战士参加的党委扩大会议上，认真总结了前一阶段举办有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班的经验，提出今后办好这种学习班，不仅要有来自“三支”“两军”第一线的战士参加，而且要吸收长年坚守战备岗位的连队战士参加，使干部更好地、更广泛地向战士学习。广州、兰州、成都等部队同战士一起在毛泽东思想学习班学习的广大干部，结合亲身体会，总结了举办有战士参加的毛泽东思想学习班的收获和经验。他们一致认为，要使我军官兵一致、上下一致的革命传统，代代相传，各级干部永远不脱离群众，永远保持普通一兵的本色，必须把这样的学习班坚持办下去，办出新的水平。
