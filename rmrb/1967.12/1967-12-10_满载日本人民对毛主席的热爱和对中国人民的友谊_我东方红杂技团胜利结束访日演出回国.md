The People's Republic of China's Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe triumphantly concluded its two-month visit to Japan and on the morning of the 8th, bearing the deep affection of the Japanese people for the great leader Chairman Mao and the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan in their struggle against the common enemy, imperialism, flew back to the motherland from Tokyo's Haneda Airport.

More than 500 friends from the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, including Chairman Kuroda Juman and Chairman Nishikawa Keibun of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) Tokyo branch, and patriotic overseas Chinese came to the airport to see them off.

Friends from Kyoto, Osaka, Fukushima, Tottori, and other distant places also came to the airport to see them off.

Japanese friends hung a large banner at the airport that read, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" Japanese friends and patriotic overseas Chinese continuously waved the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" They sang "The East is Red" and other songs praising Chairman Mao over and over again.

On the eve of their departure from Japan, the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe held a grand farewell banquet in Tokyo on the evening of the 7th. Nearly 700 friends from various parts of Japan and patriotic overseas Chinese attended the banquet.

Kuroda Juman, Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, spoke on behalf of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters at the banquet. He pointed out that the performance of the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe concretely embodied the great Mao Zedong Thought in the art of acrobatics and reflected the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It also demonstrated the spirit of the 700 million Chinese people in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

Kuroda pointed out that the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe had made a contribution in helping the Japanese people understand Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Kuroda pointed out that at a time when the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan are deepening, the Japanese government's anti-China activities are becoming increasingly blatant. Kuroda strongly condemned the recent series of anti-China crimes committed by the reactionary Sato government.

Kuroda also angrily condemned the many anti-China crimes committed by the revisionist group led by Miyamoto in recent times.

Kuroda pointed out that no matter how much the U.S. imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionary forces in Japan slander and distort, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will definitely achieve complete victory.

Kuroda concluded by expressing his fervent wish that Chairman Mao would live forever.

At this banquet, Nakajima Takeshiro, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, and Hagiwara Sadashi, Executive Director of the Japan External Trade Organization, also spoke.

The leader of the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe of the People's Republic of China spoke first at the beginning of the banquet. During the banquet, the hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to toast the health of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, wishing him eternal life and eternal life!

The Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe visited 22 major and medium-sized cities from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu Island in the south during their stay in Japan, performing 45 shows. More than 100,000 spectators from all over Japan came to watch the Chinese acrobatic art.

Japanese friends highly praised the success of this performance, saying it was a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and a crystallization of the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

Friends from various places in Japan firmly expressed their determination to follow the teachings of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, to further strengthen the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and to continue to push forward the China-Japan friendship movement.

"Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe brought us the great Mao Zedong Thought," this is the enthusiastic praise of Japanese friends for the new Chinese acrobatic art created during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The successful performances of the Dongfanghong Acrobatic Troupe in various parts of Japan deeply reflected the revolutionary friendship and fighting unity between the peoples of China and Japan.
