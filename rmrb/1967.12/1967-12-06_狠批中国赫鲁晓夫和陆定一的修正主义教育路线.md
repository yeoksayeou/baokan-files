Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "To carry out a proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, those who are determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end." This great call has received a warm response from the broad revolutionary masses, sparking a vigorous high tide of proletarian educational revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction means criticism, means revolution. Destruction must be based on reason, and reason is the basis for construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." To carry out a proletarian educational revolution, we must first start with destruction, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and clearly demarcate the lines between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the educational front. We must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Only in this way can we ensure the thorough victory of the proletarian educational revolution.

For seventeen years, China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionist element, the academic despot Lu Dingyi, have used their usurped power to control the leadership of education. They have resisted, distorted, and revised the proletarian educational line formulated by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They have promoted a counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, attempting to turn socialist schools into breeding grounds for capitalist successors, preparing public opinion and personnel for the restoration of capitalism.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev and Lu Dingyi has had a deep influence and widespread poison in the educational sector, and must be thoroughly criticized.

The struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the educational field is concentrated on the question of for which class to cultivate successors. The proletariat wants to cultivate and train successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause, while the bourgeoisie also wants to cultivate successors for the restoration of capitalism.

As early as 1934, Chairman Mao put forward the general policy for Soviet cultural education. After 1957, Chairman Mao further proposed: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop in moral, intellectual, and physical education and become socialist-conscious laborers with culture." "Education must serve proletarian politics, and education must be combined with productive labor." Chairman Mao brilliantly and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist educational theory. By following Chairman Mao's policy, we can quickly raise the socialist consciousness of our young generation, making them steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We can gradually narrow the gap between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor. We can strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and promote the cause of communism to achieve final victory in our country and throughout the world.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are terrified and hate Chairman Mao's educational policy. In 1958, China's Khrushchev personally took the lead in openly opposing Chairman Mao's educational policy. He shouted: "The past educational policy and purpose are unclear and must be criticized." By 1961, Lu Dingyi, in collaboration with domestic and foreign reactionary forces, launched a ferocious attack on Chairman Mao's educational policy. He maliciously incited: "It is impossible to create something that will last for ten thousand generations in education. Different opinions on educational policy are allowed within the Party, and opposition is also allowed outside the Party." Look, one is gnashing his teeth to "criticize," and the other is brandishing his claws to "oppose." How arrogant the counter-revolutionary momentum is!

Lu Dingyi fiercely attacked Chairman Mao's educational policy in order to stubbornly promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational policy, that is, the so-called "dual educational purpose" theory proposed according to the intentions of China's Khrushchev. Lu Dingyi divides the young generation into two types: the majority are trained to have only basic reading and writing skills, to till the land and work in factories, that is, to be "ruled by others," while a few so-called "elites" enjoy higher education and are carefully cultivated into spiritual aristocrats with "profound knowledge" and "ruling others." Lu Dingyi selects some primary, secondary, and higher schools as "key schools" and establishes a so-called "small pagoda" system. He promotes "genius education" and selects a few so-called "elites" for "key cultivation." Lu Dingyi also claims that this is an "objective law" that cannot be changed. He says: "The difference between mental and physical labor is inevitable, so some people must study more, and you cannot bring them down." Lu Dingyi is so shameless in defending the cultivation of spiritual aristocrats.

Lu Dingyi's "dual educational purpose" theory is a direct attack on the great educational policy proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao. Lu Dingyi says: "Laborers have various types, one is the difference in profession, and one is the difference in degree, such as engineers and workers. What about cultivating uniform laborers? There will never be such a thing in the world.... It is not possible to treat students as all the same, this teacher is a bureaucrat." He blatantly slanders Chairman Mao's great educational policy of cultivating "socialist-conscious laborers with culture" as "impractical" and "bureaucratic," which is extremely reactionary!

Lu Dingyi's "dual educational purpose" theory opposes the prominence of proletarian politics and advocates the primacy of intellectual education and the supremacy of professional skills. Lu Dingyi openly declares: "Intellectual education first, pursuing high admission rates, perhaps we cannot label it as bourgeois." He says: "What is the cultivation goal of primary and secondary schools? I think the main goal of primary and secondary school cultivation is to master the tools of learning. One is language and literature; another category is mathematics, physics, and chemistry, which are also basic tools." He also says: "Do not do too much ideological education." Lu Dingyi even slanders the implementation of ideological education in teaching as "simplification," "rigid application," and "high and far-reaching." He blathers on about: "Teaching according to textbooks is fine, and if you want to connect with politics, it will produce something that is neither a donkey nor a horse." In Lu Dingyi's view, primary and secondary school students do not need to learn politics, do not need to participate in labor, and only need to "master the tools of learning."

Lu Dingyi also deliberately uses the slogan of "intellectual education first" to distort the Marxist-Leninist theory of comprehensive development, blathering on about: "Having basic tools is comprehensive development." He shouts: "To reach the sky, one must study." He opposes being both red and expert, blathering on about: "It is not possible for one person to be both, it is not achievable."

"Intellectual education first" and "professional skills supreme" are extremely reactionary bourgeois slogans. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without correct political views, it is like having no soul." When we cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause, we first care about whether they love Chairman Mao, are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Only in this way can they stand firmly on the side of the proletariat and on the side of Chairman Mao in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. The so-called "intellectual education first" and "professional skills supreme" have never been genuine. China's Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi are not really against politics. Lu Dingyi says: "As long as you do well in 'scholarship,' it is also acceptable to support Tito ideologically." This reveals the truth! It turns out that Lu Dingyi and his ilk only oppose the prominence of proletarian politics and want to promote bourgeois politics. They attempt to use this hypocritical slogan to deceive the young generation into detaching from politics, production, and workers and peasants, becoming bourgeois intellectuals, and serving them in the restoration of capitalism.

To promote China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, Lu Dingyi stubbornly maintains the bourgeois educational system, teaching policies, and methods, and fiercely opposes Chairman Mao's series of instructions on the proletarian educational revolution.

Chairman Mao has always taught us: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the masses' struggle and grow in the tempering of revolutionary storms and surges." Therefore, our entire school education should be closely combined with the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, so that the young generation can participate in the three great revolutionary movements during their school learning period, taking class struggle as the main course, personally participating in industrial and agricultural production labor, and truly cultivating them into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, Chairman Mao proposed: "Gradually and cautiously carry out the reform work of the old school education and old social cultural undertakings." Later, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "shorten the school system and revolutionize education." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, teaching should be concise and precise, the number of courses should be reduced, the weight of textbooks should be reduced, examination methods should be reformed, and teaching methods should abandon the pouring method and adopt the inductive method, so that students can develop dynamically, actively, and vividly in moral, intellectual, and physical education.

However, for seventeen years, China's Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi have used counter-revolutionary two-faced methods to strongly resist Chairman Mao's instructions on reforming the school system, courses, textbooks, examinations, and teaching methods.

China's Khrushchev has always advocated the fallacy of "not hearing what is outside the window, only reading the classics." Lu Dingyi also shouts: "Education is very clear, it is called imparting knowledge and learning knowledge," slandering students' participation in the three great revolutionary movements as "not doing one's job properly," attempting to lead students down the path of reading books all day.

In terms of the school system, Lu Dingyi and his ilk maintain a set of bourgeois goods copied from abroad. They do everything possible to oppose the shortening of the learning years in primary and secondary schools and extend the learning years in higher schools to five, six, or even eight years. According to this system, students study in seclusion for a long time, detached from the three great revolutionary movements, and will inevitably become bourgeois intellectuals who "do not exert their four limbs and do not know the five grains."

While vigorously maintaining the old educational system, Lu Dingyi and his ilk also repeatedly increase the number of courses, the weight of textbooks, and learning time, resist the reform of teaching methods and examination methods, and reduce the time for political activities and productive labor.

At the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic, to cooperate with China's Khrushchev's advocacy of so-called "consolidating the new democratic order," Lu Dingyi and his ilk emphasized "protecting" and "inheriting" old things in education, resisted socialist transformation, openly opposed Chairman Mao's instruction to take the textbooks of the old liberated areas as a model, and extensively adopted the old textbooks from the Kuomintang period. As for the course settings and regulations, they also followed the Kuomintang period's practices. Later, under the instructions of China's Khrushchev, Lu Dingyi and his ilk completely copied a set of textbooks, teaching methods, and examination methods from abroad. Lu Dingyi also praised the Soviet revisionists' "Pedagogy" as "socialist" and used this book as a theoretical tool to maintain the capitalist educational system, teaching policies, and methods, and promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line.

In 1960, Lu Dingyi, under the guise of "teaching reform" and "improving teaching quality," launched a ferocious counterattack on the educational revolution that had been carried out since 1958. He slandered that the teaching quality of our schools was not as good as that of the Beiyang warlords and the Kuomintang era, vigorously advocating that the courses, textbooks, and teaching methods should align with the so-called elite schools of the Kuomintang period. In 1961, Lu Dingyi and his ilk increased the number of courses in primary schools to eleven, in junior high schools to thirteen, and in senior high schools to ten (plus four elective courses). The weekly learning time in middle schools was increased to thirty-four to thirty-six periods. They used sudden surprise examinations, making students constantly tense. They also issued gold and silver medals to students, prioritizing scores in selecting outstanding students and outstanding classes, and using the number of college admissions as the standard for evaluating the quality of schools, etc., inducing students to frantically pursue scores. In this way, the bourgeois teaching order was fully restored.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The cultural revolution reflects the political revolution and economic revolution in the realm of ideology and serves them." After the proletariat has destroyed all old institutions on the political and economic fronts and achieved decisive victories, it must immediately launch a revolution on the cultural and educational fronts, destroy the old educational system, and establish a new educational system to serve the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship.

Lu Dingyi has always been hostile to Mao Zedong Thought and opposed the educational revolution. He vigorously advocated the fallacy of "no establishment without destruction" and "establishment before destruction," promoting reformism. He said: "Teaching is not a problem of reform, it is just a matter of a little improvement, it is reformism." He maliciously slandered the educational revolution as "chaos, mess, and bias," cursing that "if it continues like this, it will collapse." This directly targets our great leader Chairman Mao. This is intolerable!

China's Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi are attempting to use this set of bourgeois educational system, teaching policies, and methods to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and resist the proletarian educational revolution.

To promote China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Lu Dingyi even proposed the reactionary slogan of "cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party" under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, allowing bourgeois intellectuals to rule the schools.

Lu Dingyi fiercely cursed Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions on strengthening Party leadership as "sectarianism" and "monopoly ideas," which must be "removed." He maliciously attacked Party leadership, saying: "There is a slogan called 'one stick all the way down,' that is, the Party committee decides everything, the branch committee decides everything, and the cell decides everything, which will cause chaos." He viciously said: "All organizations are led by Party members, I disagree." He openly fought for the rights of the bourgeoisie, proposing that "cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is inevitable, and cooperation with the bourgeoisie is inevitable." He vigorously beautified bourgeois intellectuals, advocating the so-called "leading role of teachers." He even said that reactionary academic "authorities" like Feng Youlan could also "play a leading role." In 1961, with the support of China's Khrushchev, Lu Dingyi further proposed to immediately establish a "three-three" system (proletarian intellectuals, left-wing and middle-wing bourgeois intellectuals) leadership team in all higher schools nationwide. He named this leadership team the School Affairs Committee, granting it great power, actually placing it above the school Party committee. Lu Dingyi has always openly advocated that the Party cannot lead school education. He said: "Small intellectuals (referring to comrades doing Party work in schools) leading big intellectuals, no matter what, is not possible, they will not obey."

In Lu Dingyi's "cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party" and "three-three" system, the leadership of the proletariat has been usurped. The so-called "cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party" and "three-three" system are essentially allowing the bourgeoisie to seize our power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the core of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." Lu Dingyi actually advocated "cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party" under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, which shows that he is a thorough counter-revolutionary.

Lu Dingyi allowed bourgeois intellectuals to rule our schools, promoting a bourgeois class line. He brought out the reactionary slogan of "education without distinction of class" to defend his counter-revolutionary actions. He said: "Confucius said, 'education without distinction of class.' Is that right? I say it is right, it is still 'education without distinction of class.'"

Is it really "education without distinction of class"? This is a lie. In a class society, education is class-based. "Education without distinction of class" has always been a hypocritical slogan used by the ruling class to maintain class interests. The feudal class and the bourgeoisie have both used this slogan to deceive and numb the laboring people, covering up the political, economic, and cultural oppression and exploitation relationships in class society, and covering up the evil facts of the ruling class's policy of enslaving the people. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, Lu Dingyi picked up this rubbish from the historical garbage heap to resist the Party's class line. In recruiting new students and allocating graduates at all levels of schools, he emphasized "performance" in isolation, completely ignoring political conditions. The facts show that Lu Dingyi's "emphasis on performance" is actually emphasizing professional skills and opposing the prominence of proletarian politics.

Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1934: "Workers and peasants and their children have the priority to enjoy education." However, under Lu Dingyi's slogans of "education without distinction of class" and "emphasis on performance," the children of landlords and the bourgeoisie entered various levels of key schools in large numbers, while a large number of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary soldiers, and children of revolutionary martyrs were excluded from the school gates, and even if they entered the school, they would suffer various discriminations and expulsions.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticize revisionism and repudiate oneself" as the guideline, severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line proposed and promoted by China's Khrushchev and Lu Dingyi, and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end! Carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

   狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一的修正主义教育路线
    中央教育科学研究所革命联合总部
    毛主席最近教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”这一伟大号召受到了广大革命群众的热烈响应，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的无产阶级教育革命的高潮。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”进行无产阶级教育革命，首先要破字当头，对反革命修正主义教育路线进行彻底的批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上划清教育战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的界限，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大树特树毛主席的无产阶级教育路线的绝对权威。只有这样，才能保证无产阶级教育革命获得彻底胜利。
    十七年来，中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子、大学阀陆定一，利用他们窃取的大权，把持了教育的领导岗位，抵制、歪曲和篡改毛主席、党中央所制定的无产阶级教育路线，推行反革命修正主义教育路线，妄图把社会主义的学校变成培养资产阶级接班人的温床，为复辟资本主义准备舆论、准备干部。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一的反革命修正主义教育路线，在教育界影响很深，流毒很广，必须彻底批判。
        推行修正主义的教育方针
    教育领域内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，集中在为哪个阶级培养接班人的问题上。无产阶级要培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人，资产阶级也要培养他们实现资本主义复辟的接班人。
    早在一九三四年，毛主席就提出了苏维埃文化教育的总方针。一九五七年以后，毛主席进一步提出：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”。毛主席天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的教育理论。按照毛主席的方针去做，就一定能够迅速地提高我国青少年一代的社会主义觉悟，成为坚强的无产阶级革命事业接班人；就一定能够逐步地缩小工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别；就一定能够加强无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，促进共产主义事业在我国和全世界取得最后的胜利。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对毛主席的教育方针怕得要死，恨得要命。一九五八年，中国赫鲁晓夫就迫不及待地亲自出马，公开反对毛主席的教育方针。他叫嚣：“过去的教育方针、教育目的不明确，要进行批判。”到了一九六一年，陆定一配合国内外反动势力，向毛主席的教育方针发起了猖狂进攻。他恶意煽动说：“在教育上想搞一个传至万世的东西不可能，对教育方针有不同意见，在党内是可以的，在党外也允许反对。”看，一个咬牙切齿地要“批判”，一个张牙舞爪地要“反对”，反革命气焰何等嚣张！
    陆定一大肆攻击毛主席的教育方针，为的就是顽固推行反革命修正主义的教育方针，即他按照中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨提出的所谓“双重教育目的”论。陆定一把青少年一代划分为两种人，其中大多数被训练成为只有初步读写能力的，能够种地、做工的劳动力，即“治于人”的人，而少数所谓“尖子”则享受较高的教育，被精心培养成为具有“高深知识”、“治人”的精神贵族。陆定一选择一些大、中、小学作为“重点学校”，建立所谓“小宝塔”的系统。他大搞“天才教育”，选拔少数所谓“尖子”进行“重点培养”。陆定一还硬说这是“客观规律”，是无法改变的。他说：“脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，不可避免的要存在，那么就有人要读的高一点，你们不能把他降下来。”陆定一就是这样无耻地为培养精神贵族作辩护。
    陆定一的“双重教育目的”论，是直接攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席所提出的教育方针的。陆定一说：“劳动者有各种各样，一种是行业的不同，一种是程度的不同，有工程师、工人。什么培养千篇一律的劳动者，世界上是不会有的。……通通一样是不行的，把学生看成都是一样，这个先生就是官僚主义”。他明目张胆地污蔑毛主席提出的培养“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”这个伟大的教育方针是“行不通”的，是“官僚主义”，真是反动透顶！
    陆定一的“双重教育目的”论，是反对突出无产阶级政治，宣扬智育第一、业务至上的。陆定一公开宣称：“智育第一，片面追求升学率，恐怕不能扣资产阶级帽子。”他说：“中小学培养目标究竟是什么？我想中小学的培养目标，最主要的是掌握学习的工具。一个是语文、文学；还有一类，数学、物理、化学，也是基本工具。”他还说：“思想教育不要搞那么多。”陆定一甚至把教学中贯彻思想教育，污蔑为“简单化”、“生搬硬套”和“好高鹜远”等等。他胡说什么：“按照教科书进行教学就是了，要联系政治就要产生非驴非马。”在陆定一看来，中、小学生根本不要学习政治，不要参加劳动，只要“掌握学习的工具”就行了。
    陆定一还故意用“智育第一”的口号，来歪曲马克思列宁主义关于全面发展的学说，胡说什么“有了基本工具就是全面发展”。他叫嚷：“要上天，就要念书。”他反对又红又专，胡说什么“两者兼备于一人是不行的，是办不到的”。
    “智育第一”、“业务至上”，是极端反动的资产阶级的口号。毛主席教导我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”我们在培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的时候，首先关心的是他们是不是热爱毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，全心全意为人民服务。只有这样，才能使他们在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，坚定地站在无产阶级一边，站在毛主席一边。所谓“智育第一”、“业务至上”，从来都不是真实的。中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流，也不是真的不要政治。陆定一说：只要搞好“学问”，“思想上拥护铁托，……也是可以的”。这就一语泄露了天机！原来陆定一之流只是不要突出无产阶级政治，而要突出资产阶级政治。他们企图利用这个虚伪的口号，诱骗青少年一代脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离工农，成为资产阶级知识分子，为他们复辟资本主义而效劳。
    维护旧的教育制度、教学方针和方法
    陆定一为了推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，顽固地维护资产阶级的教育制度、教学方针和方法，疯狂地反对毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的一系列指示。
    毛主席历来教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”因此，我们整个学校教育事业都应该紧密地和阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动结合起来，使青少年一代在学校学习期间就投身于三大革命运动中去，以阶级斗争为主课，亲身参加工农业生产劳动，把他们真正培养成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠的接班人。
    毛主席在建国初期就提出：“有步骤地谨慎地进行旧有学校教育事业和旧有社会文化事业的改革工作”。以后，毛主席又发出了“学制要缩短，教育要革命”的伟大号召。根据毛主席的教导，教学要少而精，课程门类要减少，教材分量要减轻，考试方法要改革，教学方法要废止注入式，采取启发式，使学生在德、智、体诸方面生动活泼地主动地得到发展。
    但是十七年来，中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流采用反革命两面手法，极力抵制毛主席关于改革学制、课程、教材、考试和教学方法的指示。
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯宣扬“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”的谬论。陆定一也叫嚣“教育这个东西很清楚，叫做传授知识，学习知识”，污蔑学生参加三大革命运动是“不务正业”，妄图把学生引向死读书本的邪路。
    在学制上，陆定一之流维护从外国抄袭来的一整套资产阶级货色。他们千方百计地反对缩短中、小学的学习年限，并延长高等学校的学习年限为五年、六年甚至八年。按照这个学制，学生长期闭门读书，脱离三大革命运动，势必变成“四体不勤，五谷不分”的资产阶级知识分子。
    陆定一之流在极力维护旧教育制度的同时，还一再增加课程门类、教材分量和学习时间，抵制改革教学方法和考试方法，削减政治活动和生产劳动的时间。
    建国之初，为了配合中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹所谓“巩固新民主主义秩序”的政治需要，陆定一之流在教育上强调“保护”、“继承”旧东西，抵制社会主义改造，公开反对毛主席关于要以老解放区课本为蓝本的指示，而大量地采用国民党时期的旧课本。至于课程设置、规章制度，也是沿袭了国民党时期的那一套。后来，陆定一之流在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，又完全照搬外国的一整套教材，乃至教学方法和考试方法。陆定一还吹捧苏修的《教育学》是“社会主义”的，并把这本书作为维护资本主义教育制度、教学方针和方法，推行反革命修正主义教育路线的理论工具。
    一九六○年，陆定一更打着“教学改革”、“提高教学质量”的幌子，对一九五八年以来开展的教育革命进行了猖狂反扑。他污蔑我们学校的教学质量不如北洋军阀、国民党时代，竭力鼓吹在课程、教材、教法方面向国民党时期所谓名牌学校看齐。一九六一年，陆定一之流把小学的课程增加到十一门，初中课程增加到十三门，高中课程增加到十门（外加四门选修课）。中学每周学习时间增加到三十四至三十六节。他们采用突然袭击的考试方法，使学生天天处于紧张状态。他们还在学生中颁发金质奖章和银质奖章，在选拔优秀生和优秀班级时把分数放在第一位，在评价学校好坏时按高考录取人数为标准，等等，引诱学生拚命追求分数。这样，就全面地恢复了资产阶级的教学秩序。
    毛主席指出：“文化革命是在观念形态上反映政治革命和经济革命，并为它们服务的。”无产阶级在政治战线、经济战线上摧毁了一切旧制度，取得了决定性的胜利之后，就必然要立即开展文化教育战线上的革命，摧毁旧教育制度，建立新教育制度，为巩固无产阶级专政服务。
    陆定一一贯仇视毛泽东思想，反对教育革命。他大肆宣扬“未立不破”、“先立后破”的谬论，鼓吹改良主义。他说：“教学还不是改革问题，就是改良一点，是改良主义。”他恶毒地污蔑教育革命是“乱、糟、偏”，咒骂“这样搞下去要垮台”。这是把矛头直接指向了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流，就是妄图利用这一套资产阶级的教育制度、教学方针和方法，反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，抵制无产阶级教育革命。
      让资产阶级知识分子统治学校
    反革命修正主义分子陆定一，为了推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，竟然在无产阶级专政的条件下，提出“国共合作”的反动口号，让资产阶级知识分子统治学校。
    陆定一疯狂地咒骂毛主席、党中央关于加强党的领导的指示是“宗派主义”，“垄断想法”，必须“去掉”。他恶毒地攻击党的领导说：“有个口号叫‘一杆子插到底’，就是党委决定一切，系总支决定一切，支部决定一切，这样就乱了。”他恶狠狠地说：“一切组织都由党员领导，我不同意。”他公开为资产阶级争权，提出“非要国共合作不可，非要与资产阶级合作不可”。他极力美化资产阶级知识分子，鼓吹所谓“教师的主导作用”。他甚至说，象冯友兰这样的资产阶级反动学术“权威”，也可以“起主导作用”。到了一九六一年，陆定一在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，进一步要在全国高等学校里立即建立“三、三”制（无产阶级知识分子，资产阶级知识分子的左派、中间派）的领导班子。他把这个领导班子定名为校务委员会，赋予极大的权力，实际上使它凌驾于学校党委之上。陆定一一贯公开宣扬党不能领导学校教育。他说：“小知识分子（指在学校做党的工作的同志）领导大知识分子，无论如何是不行的，他不服的。”
    在陆定一的“国共合作”、“三、三”制里，无产阶级的领导权被篡夺了。所谓“国共合作”、“三、三”制，其实质就是让资产阶级专我们的政。
    毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”陆定一居然在无产阶级专政的条件下，搞什么“国共合作”，这正说明他是一个地地道道的反革命。
    陆定一让资产阶级知识分子统治我们的学校，推行了一条资产阶级的阶级路线。他搬出了一个“有教无类”的反动口号，来为他的这种反革命行径作辩护。他说：“孔子说，‘有教无类’。对不对？我说对，还是‘有教无类’。”
    真的是“有教无类”吗？这是弥天大谎。在有阶级的社会里，教育是有阶级性的。“有教无类”一直都是统治阶级用来维护阶级私利的虚伪口号。封建阶级、资产阶级都曾经利用过这个口号来欺骗麻痹劳动人民，掩盖阶级社会里政治上、经济上、文化上的压迫和剥削的关系，掩盖统治阶级实行愚民政策的罪恶事实。在无产阶级专政的条件下，陆定一从历史垃圾堆里拣起这个破烂，来抵制党的阶级路线。在各级学校招收新生和进行毕业生分配时，他孤立地强调“重在表现”，根本不看政治条件。事实说明，陆定一的“重在表现”，就是重在业务，反对突出无产阶级政治。
    毛主席早在一九三四年就指出：“工农及其子女有享受教育的优先权”。但是，在陆定一的“有教无类”、“重在表现”的口号下，地主、资产阶级的子女，大量地进入各级重点学校，而大量的工人、贫下中农、革命干部、革命军人和革命烈士的子女，却被排斥在校门之外，即使进入学校也要受到种种歧视和排挤。
    让我们高高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一所提出和推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
