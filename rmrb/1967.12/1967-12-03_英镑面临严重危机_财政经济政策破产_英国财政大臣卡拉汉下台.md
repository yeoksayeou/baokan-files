In the wake of the pound's devaluation and the worsening financial and economic situation in Britain, British Chancellor of the Exchequer James Callaghan announced his resignation on November 29. This further indicates the failure of the Labour government's financial and economic policies over the past three years.

Callaghan took office as Chancellor of the Exchequer in October 1964 with the Wilson government. Over the past three years, Britain's financial and economic situation has deteriorated rapidly. Although the Wilson government has spared no effort, relying on the United States for large loans and taking various measures to cut into the livelihood of the working people in an attempt to improve the dire financial and economic situation, these efforts have been ineffective. Callaghan's three goals for improving the British economy—economic growth, full employment, and a stable pound—have all been declared failures. Ultimately, this led to the devaluation of the pound on November 18.

After the devaluation of the pound, class contradictions within Britain have become increasingly sharp. The broad masses of working people are growing stronger in their opposition to the Wilson government, and contradictions within the ruling class have intensified. In this context, even British bourgeois newspapers have complained that not only should Callaghan resign, but "the entire government should resign."

    英镑面临严重危机　财政经济政策破产
    英国财政大臣卡拉汉下台
    新华社伦敦电　在英镑刚刚贬值，英国的财政经济病入膏肓的情况下，英国财政大臣卡拉汉于十一月二十九日宣布辞职，这进一步表明了工党政府三年多来所推行的财政经济政策的破产。
    卡拉汉是一九六四年十月随着威尔逊政府上台而担任财政大臣的。三年来，英国的财政经济状况急剧恶化，虽然威尔逊政府费尽心机，一面依靠美国，大借外债，一面采取各种措施向劳动人民开刀，企图改善百孔千疮的财政经济状况，但是，毫不奏效。卡拉汉提出的“改善”英国经济三个目标：经济增长、完全就业、稳定英镑，都先后宣布破产。并且最终导致了十一月十八日的英镑贬值。
    英镑贬值后，英国国内阶级矛盾日趋尖锐，广大劳动人民越来越强烈地反对威尔逊政府，统治集团内部矛盾更加激化，在这种情况下，连英国资产阶级报刊也抱怨说，不仅卡拉汉应当辞职，而且“整个政府也应当辞职”。
