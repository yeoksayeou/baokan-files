Hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians resolutely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, and together with the revolutionary people of the world, will fight to the end to thoroughly defeat U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

New China News Agency, December 19th: After the telegram from our great leader Chairman Mao to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, was published, the hundreds of millions of military personnel and civilians across the country enthusiastically cheered. Revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, revolutionary masses, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army pointed out that Chairman Mao's telegram most fully expresses the resolve of the 700 million Chinese people to firmly support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. It most brilliantly and correctly points out the path to victory for the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people of the world, providing the greatest support and encouragement to the Vietnamese people and all revolutionary people of the world. They expressed that they would definitely follow the teachings of the great commander Chairman Mao, vowing to be a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people in driving out every last U.S. aggressor from Vietnam. Together with all revolutionary people of the world, they will fight to the end to thoroughly defeat U.S.-led imperialism, modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist clique, and the reactionaries of all countries.

Revolutionary masses in the capital, with hearts full of excitement, studied and discussed the telegram from the great leader Chairman Mao to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho. They enthusiastically hailed the glorious banner of the people of South Vietnam—the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam—on its seventh anniversary, and enthusiastically hailed the great victories of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. A responsible person from the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress said, "Chairman Mao's telegram most fully embodies the resolve of the 700 million Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression. We will, as always, more resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Vietnamese people have set a brilliant example in their struggle for the liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations. We Chinese workers are proud to have such brave comrades-in-arms. We firmly believe that the great Vietnamese people, by persisting in a protracted war, will surely thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors." Red Guards in the capital said, "The great victories of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation once again prove the brilliant judgment of Chairman Mao that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Their victories greatly inspire the revolutionary struggles of all revolutionary people of the world. The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: 'All reactionary forces, when they are on the verge of extinction, always make desperate struggles.' Now, U.S. imperialism is adopting military adventurism and political deception, desperately trying to save their doomed fate. The Soviet revisionist clique is also intensifying its collusion with U.S. imperialism, attempting to bring the Vietnamese issue into the track of Soviet-U.S. cooperation, extinguishing the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. However, the iron will of the heroic Vietnamese people to unite and resist U.S. aggression is unshakable. They will persist in fighting, in protracted resistance, and will surely thoroughly annihilate the U.S. invaders. The Red Guards of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, most resolutely support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. As soon as the great commander Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately march to the front lines and fight shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people to annihilate the enemy."

A responsible person from the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters said, "The telegram from the great leader Chairman Mao to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho has extremely great practical significance and far-reaching historical significance, providing the greatest encouragement and support to the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world. Under the brilliant leadership of the great leader Chairman Huynh, the Vietnamese people have displayed a great fearless revolutionary spirit of decisive battle and decisive victory, unleashing the immense power of people's war, making the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism suffer a humiliating defeat, completely exposing the true face of the U.S. imperialist paper tiger. We most enthusiastically hail the Vietnamese people's fight well and fight fiercely. The workers of Shanghai and the workers of Vietnam are class brothers fighting side by side. Their struggle is our struggle, and their victory is our victory. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution we are carrying out is the greatest support for the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world, and the victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is also the greatest support and encouragement for us. In the face of the strong unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam, any military adventurism and political deception by U.S. imperialism is doomed to fail. A Red Guard who recently participated in the China-Vietnam Friendship Association delegation to visit Vietnam, a responsible person from the Revolutionary Committee of East China Normal University, excitedly said, 'In Vietnam, I personally saw the heroic Vietnamese people fearlessly resisting violence, fearlessly sacrificing, and fighting to the death with the U.S. invaders. Their daring to struggle and daring to win revolutionary spirit has set a brilliant example for all peoples of the world, greatly inspiring and educating us. We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards, always ready to contribute everything for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for the world revolution. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and build our country into a red Mao Zedong Thought school, becoming the most reliable rear base for the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world.'

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and revolutionary masses in Tianjin expressed that they would resolutely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, regarding supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation as their unshirkable internationalist duty. Revolutionary workers of the No. 3 Dyeing Factory said, "In the telegram to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman Mao pointed out: 'Your victory once again shows that, regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated.' Our great leader Chairman Mao's theory of people's war is a great truth applicable to all four seas. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and revolutionary masses expressed that they would definitely respond to Chairman Mao's call, better grasp the revolution and promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation with practical actions.

Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards in the frontline provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan most resolutely support the telegram from the great leader Chairman Mao to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho, warmly celebrating the seventh anniversary of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Revolutionary workers in Guangzhou said, "Chairman Mao's telegram speaks the hearts of the 700 million Chinese people. We Guangzhou workers must carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, shoulder the glorious task of aiding Vietnam and resisting U.S. aggression. Whatever the Vietnamese people need, we will support them. We will definitely unite, fight, and win with the Vietnamese people, vowing to drive the U.S. aggressors out of Vietnam. The entire crew of the No. 1018 'South China Sea Hero Ship,' who had bravely fought with U.S. aggressor planes last August, proudly said, 'We have fought with the U.S. aggressors. As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, we can defeat the U.S. aggressors.' They firmly expressed that as long as the Vietnamese people need, no matter how rampant the U.S. is, no matter how great the sacrifice, our revolutionary sailors' resolve to aid Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression will never waver. Poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Guangzhou said, 'The Vietnamese people are our Chinese people's brothers. U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is aggression against China. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely respond to the battle call of the great leader Chairman Mao, vowing to be a strong rear guard for the Vietnamese people.'

The telegram from our great leader Chairman Mao to Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho has stirred up a wave of enthusiasm among the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army. The soldiers and officers repeatedly shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Vietnam will win! The U.S. will be defeated! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They said, "Chairman Mao's telegram most fully and concentratedly expresses the iron will and fighting resolve of the 700 million Chinese people to firmly support the Vietnamese people in defeating the U.S. aggressors. We will definitely unshakably support the Vietnamese people's armed revolutionary struggle against U.S. aggression. A company of a certain unit guarding in front of Tiananmen Square seriously studied Chairman Mao's telegram. The entire company held a meeting today, enthusiastically hailing the great victories of the people of South Vietnam in the war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. They said, 'The Chinese people, in the War of Liberation and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, have exposed the U.S. imperialist paper tiger. Today, the Vietnamese people have again made the U.S. imperialists suffer a humiliating defeat, making the paper tiger reveal its true face again. As long as all the peoples of the world unite closely and fight together, we will surely defeat imperialism and all reactionaries.' Representatives attending the Guangzhou Military Region's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works, representatives from Beijing who had just returned to the Haiphong frontline from attending the Navy's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works, and air force units in the Guangxi region that had consecutively achieved three victories in three battles against invading U.S. planes all expressed that they would definitely further arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, be highly vigilant, strengthen war preparedness, and resolutely annihilate all invading enemies. We will definitely respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, until achieving complete victory.

    天津市广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众表示，坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把支援越南人民的抗美救国战争当作自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。色织三厂的革命职工说，毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电中指出：“你们的胜利又一次表明，国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”我们伟大领袖毛主席关于人民战争的理论，是放之四海而皆准的伟大真理。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众表示，一定要坚决响应毛主席的号召，更好地抓革命，促生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，以实际行动来支援越南人民的抗美救国战争。

    我们伟大领袖毛主席给阮友寿主席的贺电在中国人民解放军广大指战员中激起一片欢腾。指战员们不断高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“越南必胜！美帝必败！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们说，毛主席的贺电，最充分、最集中地表达了七亿中国人民坚决支持越南人民打败美国侵略者的钢铁意志和战斗决心。我们一定坚定不移地支持越南人民的反美武装革命斗争。守卫在天安门前的某部一连，认真学习了毛主席的贺电。全连指战员今天举行大会，热烈欢呼越南南方人民在抗美救国战争中取得的伟大胜利。他们说，中国人民在解放战争和抗美援朝的战争中，戳穿了美帝国主义这只纸老虎。今天，越南人民又把美帝国主义打得走投无路，狼狈不堪，使纸老虎再一次现了原形。只要全世界人民紧紧地团结起来，共同战斗，就一定能把帝国主义和一切反动派打倒。出席广州部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表、从北京刚刚返回海防前线的出席海军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表和在广西地区痛歼入侵美机连续获得三战三捷的空军部队指战员们都表示，一定要进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，百倍警惕，加强战备，坚决消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人。我们坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，全力支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，直到取得彻底胜利。
