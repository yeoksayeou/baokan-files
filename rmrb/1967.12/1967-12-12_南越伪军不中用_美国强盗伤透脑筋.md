Title: The South Vietnamese Puppet Army is Useless, the American Bandits are at Their Wits' End

Under the heavy blows of the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces, the South Vietnamese puppet army, which has suffered heavy casualties and low morale, is becoming increasingly useless. This has left the Johnson administration, which has already thrown 500,000 American invaders directly into the South Vietnamese battlefield and still suffered repeated defeats, at their wits' end.

770,000 Eliminated in Seven Years

According to incomplete statistics, from 1961 to the end of the rainy season this year, the South Vietnamese puppet army has been eliminated by the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces by more than 770,000, including over 100 entire battalions being wiped out. Many of the puppet army's regular divisions have been so severely depleted that the puppet regime cannot reconstitute them to full strength. The head of the invading American forces, Westmoreland, admitted that out of the current 150 puppet army battalions, most have lost their combat effectiveness. The puppet army is not only unable to serve as the frontline defense but also cannot be relied upon to defend bases, towns, and supply lines. It is under these circumstances that the Americans, with no other choice, have the puppet army mainly engaged in "pacification" activities. However, the Americans have to admit that the puppet army's "pacification" activities have suffered serious failures. Recently, under the orders of their American masters, the puppet regime decided to reorganize the puppet army, disbanding four or five out of the current ten divisions, splitting them into smaller units, and placing them under the command of puppet provincial governors. This indicates that part of the puppet army has already degenerated into mere security forces used to deal with the South Vietnamese people's guerrilla forces. This marks the serious failure of the American strategy in Vietnam.

"The Dogs Don't Follow"

The United States spends tens of billions of dollars annually to maintain this so-called 500,000-strong puppet army, but it is so useless, which indeed makes the American imperialists very frustrated. Recently, not only American officials in Saigon have publicly criticized the puppet army's corruption and incompetence, but also the U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara and the former U.S. "Ambassador" to Saigon, Taylor, who had just stepped down, publicly expressed their great dissatisfaction with the puppet army's incompetence in the war during their "inspection" trip to South Vietnam in July. Even American newspapers admit: "One of the biggest problems the United States has not solved in Vietnam is how to turn the Saigon army into a strong and capable fighting force," and they believe this is Westmoreland's "most serious failure."

To boost the morale of the puppet army, the American invaders have recently racked their brains to come up with all sorts of "solutions," such as having the Saigon puppet regime expand the army; the United States sending more "advisors" to the puppet army (their number to be increased by half compared to now) and gradually integrating the puppet army into the U.S. military in platoon and squad units under "joint command," etc., attempting to improve the combat effectiveness of the puppet army and strengthen control over it.

But these so-called "solutions" absolutely cannot solve the fatal weakness of this anti-people puppet army, whose morale is increasingly low. According to reports, in the face of the strong military and political offensives of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, by the end of 1966, more than 300,000 puppet soldiers had been dissolved. More and more puppet soldiers realize that following American imperialism and the traitorous puppet regime is a dead end, and large-scale desertions, mutinies, and even anti-war and refusal-to-fight incidents frequently occur. Anti-American sentiments within the puppet army are also growing. These are all problems that the U.S.-puppet clique cannot cure no matter what magic potions they use. As for expanding the army, with the enemy-occupied areas shrinking day by day and the people's struggle against the U.S.-puppet clique in the occupied areas intensifying, the puppet regime has reached the point of exhaustion of manpower. Moreover, the United States' attempt to achieve its long-unrealized goal of establishing a U.S.-puppet "joint command" to strengthen control over the puppet army by increasing the number of "advisors" and implementing "joint command" can only deepen the contradictions between the United States and the puppet army.

Look! Surrendering to the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, becoming prisoners, this is the fate of the American bandits and their running dogs—the South Vietnamese puppet army.

### 南越伪军不中用  美国强盗伤透脑筋

　　南越伪军不中用
    美国强盗伤透脑筋
    在越南南方人民解放武装力量的沉重打击下，伤亡严重、士气不振的南越伪军，越来越不中用。这使得业已把五十万美国侵略军直接投入南越战场而仍然连遭惨败的约翰逊政府，伤透了脑筋。
    七年被歼灭七十七万
    据不完全统计，在从一九六一年到今年雨季结束的期间内，南越伪军已被南方人民解放武装力量歼灭七十七万多名，其中包括一百多个整营被全歼。伪军的许多正规师，都由于伤亡过重使傀儡集团无法把它们重新拼凑满额。侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰供认，在现有的一百五十个伪军营中，大部分失去了战斗力。伪军既不堪用来挡头阵，而防卫一些基地、城镇和交通线也靠不住。正是在这种情况下，美国无可奈何地让伪军主要担任“绥靖”活动。但是，美国也不得不承认伪军的“绥靖”活动遭到严重失败。最近，傀儡集团在美国主子的命令下，决定对伪军进行改组，解散现有十个师中的四、五个师，把它们分成小部队，交由伪省长指挥。这表明，一部分伪军已经沦为仅仅是用来对付南越人民游击队的保安部队了。这标志着美国侵越战略的严重破产。
    “走狗不走”
    美国每年要花费数以十亿计的巨额美元，来豢养这支号称有五、六十万人的走狗军队，但它们却如此不中用，这确实是使美帝国主义者感到十分恼火的事。最近，不仅在西贡的美国文武官员纷纷对伪军的腐败无能公开提出指责，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉和下台了的前美国驻西贡“大使”泰勒七月份在赴南越“视察”时，也公开对伪军在战争中的无能表示大为不满。连美国的报刊都承认：“美国在越南没有解决的最大问题之一，是怎样把西贡的军队变成一支坚强的、有能力的战斗部队”，并且认为，这是威斯特摩兰的“最严重的失败”。
    为了给伪军打气，最近美国侵略者绞尽脑汁又想了这样那样的“办法”，诸如让西贡傀儡集团扩军；美国向伪军派遣更多的“顾问”（其数量比现在多一半）和逐步将伪军按班排并入美军实行“联合指挥”等等，企图以此来提高伪军的战斗力和加强对伪军的控制。
    厌战、拒战、反战
    但这些所谓的“办法”，绝对解决不了这支反人民的走狗军队士气越来越低落的致命弱点。据报道，在人民解放武装力量强大的军事和政治攻势面前，到一九六六年底为止，已有三十多万伪军被瓦解。越来越多的伪军意识到追随美帝国主义和卖国傀儡集团是死路一条，大批开小差、哗变，甚至反战、拒战的事件，屡屡发生。伪军中的仇美情绪，也越来越有所增长。这些都是美伪集团无论用什么灵丹妙药也无法医治得了的。至于扩军，随着敌占区日益缩小，敌占区人民反美伪集团的斗争日益高涨，傀儡集团已经到了兵源枯竭的地步。此外，美国想通过增派“顾问”和实行“联合指挥”来达到它长期不能实现的成立美伪“联合司令部”以加强控制伪军的目的，这样做，只能加深美国和伪军之间的矛盾。

    看！向南越解放军举手投降，当俘虏，这就是美国强盗和它的走狗——南越伪军的下场。
