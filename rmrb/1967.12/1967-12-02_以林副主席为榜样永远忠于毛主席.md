The Navy Party Committee Decides to Resolutely Implement Comrade Lin Biao's Great Inscription

The Navy Party Committee on December 1 decided to implement Comrade Lin Biao's great inscription for the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Navy. The full text is as follows:

In the new stage of Marxism-Leninism's development into Mao Zedong Thought, in the new era of the world entering the era of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the great situation where our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, and our closest comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, on November 29, inscribed for our Navy's first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works: "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsperson; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." This is a heartening great event in the Navy's political life and a heartening great event in the political life of the entire Party, the entire military, and the entire nation. This is the greatest concern, the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, the greatest education, and the greatest spur for our great helmsperson Chairman Mao and our respected Vice Chairman Lin for all the officers and soldiers of the Navy. "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsperson; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought" is a universal and great truth applicable everywhere. The victory of the Chinese revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of the world revolution also relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The practice of the struggle of the Chinese and world revolutions has proven: the ship of the Chinese and world revolutions, under the personal helmsmanship and guidance of our great helmsperson Chairman Mao, can break through stormy waves and navigate past treacherous shoals and reefs to achieve great victories.

Vice Chairman Lin's inscription: "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsperson; making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," most fully expresses the class feelings of the entire military, the entire Party, the entire nation, and the people of the world towards our great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. It is forever the direction of the Navy's construction and forever the lighthouse guiding our victory on the revolutionary course.

Vice Chairman Lin is our great leader Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms, best student, and best successor. He is the deputy commander-in-chief of the people, and he has given the most comprehensive, correct, and scientific evaluation of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. He has always been the most loyal, most resolute, and most courageous in defending Chairman Mao's supreme leadership, defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. With the greatest foresight and the greatest courage, he has led and organized the entire Party, the entire military, and the people of the nation in the great campaign to popularize Mao Zedong Thought, opening a new era where hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Vice Chairman Lin holds the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought highest, understands it deepest, and uses it best. Vice Chairman Lin is the highest model for the entire Party to learn from, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought, and he is forever our shining example to learn from. For Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription, we must study it seriously, understand it deeply, implement it resolutely, and carry it out repeatedly. To this end, we make the following decision:

(1) To implement Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription, we must take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, be forever loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must firmly establish the absolute authority of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. This is the most fundamental stance, the highest consciousness, the greatest principle, the purest party spirit, the greatest public spirit, and the greatest goodness of a proletarian revolutionary. We must deepen our class feelings of loving Chairman Mao, raise our understanding of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and firmly believe in, firmly adhere to, and resolutely and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's instructions. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will strike. No matter how the heavens and earth change, our red hearts loyal to the great helmsperson and the great Mao Zedong Thought will never change. Whoever supports Chairman Mao, we will be close to them. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight them. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, the entire Party will exterminate them, and the entire nation will condemn them. We will defend Chairman Mao to the death, defend Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death, and defend Vice Chairman Lin and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the death.

(2) To implement and carry out Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription, we must take Vice Chairman Lin as our example and launch a greater campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must truly master and grasp the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Currently, we must focus on deeply studying Chairman Mao's great theory and practice of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, intensify the education of the struggle between the two lines and the education on the situation, further raise our understanding of the great significance and great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and raise our consciousness of class struggle and the struggle between the lines. We must regard the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and heavier than everything. Higher than everything means to regard Mao Zedong Thought as the highest directive, the highest authority, the highest guiding principle for all work, the highest principle for handling all problems, the highest standard for distinguishing right from wrong, and the highest criterion for guiding all words and deeds. Greater than everything means to regard the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the top priority of the revolution and the top priority of one's life, and no amount of difficulty can deter us, and no amount of time can squeeze us out. Prior to everything means to prioritize the study of Chairman Mao's works, and when arranging, inspecting, and summarizing work, we must first arrange, inspect, and summarize the study of Chairman Mao's works. We must insist on using the first hour of the day for the political department, the first hour of training for the troops, and the first class of the day for the schools to study Chairman Mao's works every day. All political education and military theory education must use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, and technical and professional courses must also be guided by Mao Zedong Thought. All personnel must regard Chairman Mao's works as the most fundamental compulsory course and must integrate the study and application of Chairman Mao's works into the entire process of work, training, combat, and the completion of various tasks. Heavier than everything means to regard the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as the fundamental of the fundamental and the key of the key in the work of the troops, and we must devote the greatest effort to it. If we do not grasp it tightly, it is as if we have not grasped it at all. We must have new heights in our understanding, new levels in our study and application, and new attitudes in our leadership. We must produce good examples, good cadres, and good experiences.

(3) To implement Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription, we must take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implement the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must fiercely criticize "selfishness" and launch an offensive battle in the depths of our souls to thoroughly transform our worldview. We must fiercely criticize "revisionism" and use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to wage a "people's war," widely and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize and repudiate China's Khrushchev and his agents Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan, and thoroughly eliminate their influence and poison. We must resolutely follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao on "the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left" and "support the army and love the people," and roundly complete the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries." We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness," heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and be ready at any time to annihilate all invading enemies, defend the coastal defense, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and create new merits for the people.

(4) To implement Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription, we must take Vice Chairman Lin as our example, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's military thought and line of building the army, and consciously carry out the struggle between the two military lines. Our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao has formulated for our army a complete and scientific Marxist-Leninist line of building the army from a political perspective, and for our Navy, he has set the great construction policy of "to oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must definitely build a powerful navy." We must most loyally implement and defend Chairman Mao's line and thought of building the army, and we must most loyally implement and defend Vice Chairman Lin's entire set of policies and principles. We must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, insist on the Four Firsts, promote the Three-Eight Style, carry forward the Three Great Democracies, deeply carry out the movement of the Four Good Units, and resolutely struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ronghuan's bourgeois reactionary military line. We must arm the minds of all officers and soldiers with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and build the Navy into a solid sea wall.

(5) To implement Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription, we require all levels of Party committees and branches to seriously study and implement Vice Chairman Lin's instructions. We must, with the greatest enthusiasm, the strongest resolve, and the fastest speed, transmit Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription to every ship, every crew, every company, every base, every dock, and every sentry post. We must, through various forms, extensively and deeply carry out celebratory, propagandistic, and educational activities, and use sufficient time to organize cadres, soldiers, workers, family members, and others to seriously study and discuss, so that it becomes known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. All units must set up large billboards of Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription in their camp areas. The Navy Political Department must produce and distribute plaques and badges of Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription to the units. All comrades in the Navy must turn Vice Chairman Lin's great inscription into a great driving force to promote all work, and with new achievements and new victories, respond to the greatest concern and expectations of our great helmsperson Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and strive to build the Navy into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.
