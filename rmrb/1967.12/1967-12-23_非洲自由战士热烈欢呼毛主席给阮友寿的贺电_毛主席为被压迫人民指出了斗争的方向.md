	African freedom fighters have recently expressed their warm welcome to the telegram sent by Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, to Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. They unanimously pointed out that Chairman Mao's telegram is not only a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. imperialism but also a great encouragement to all oppressed peoples around the world who are struggling for liberation. They believe that only by following the path of armed struggle pointed out by Chairman Mao and learning from the glorious example of the heroic Vietnamese people, can the oppressed peoples of the world achieve true liberation.

	The representative of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee in Cairo, Sitole, said: "The people of Mozambique are greatly inspired by Chairman Mao's telegram. As the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao has a deep understanding of the struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. At every critical moment in the struggle, he always represents the 700 million people of China in expressing the most resolute support to the people in the struggle. The new China led by Chairman Mao is a fortress of steel in the world revolution."

	Sitole emphasized: "As Chairman Mao teaches us, the decisive factor in war is not modern weapons but the people. Like the people of South Vietnam, the people of Mozambique can only achieve true liberation through people's war."

	Sitole condemned U.S. imperialism's attempt to use its tool, the United Nations, to interfere in Vietnamese affairs. He said: "The United Nations has no right to interfere in Vietnamese affairs. The Vietnamese issue can only be resolved by the Vietnamese people themselves."

	The representative of the Basutoland Congress Party in Cairo, Mapafani, pointed out: "Chairman Mao's high evaluation of the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and his profound analysis of the situation in Vietnam are indeed brilliant. This not only greatly encourages the Vietnamese people but also points out the true path to liberation for the people in struggle."

	Mapafani said: "The aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism in Vietnam are doomed to failure. The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation has already proven that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger."

	The representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress in Cairo, Sejake, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's brilliant statement in the telegram: "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and rely firmly on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." He said: "This again shows that Chairman Mao completely believes in the oppressed masses. This reminds me of another brilliant statement by Chairman Mao: 'The people, only the people, are the true creators of world history.'"

	Sejake said: "Chairman Mao's telegram issues a resounding call to all oppressed peoples around the world to fight against imperialism led by the United States."

	Sejake strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists' false support and true betrayal of the Vietnamese people. He said: "From the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Vietnamese people's struggle and from our own experience, we have drawn a conclusion: to oppose imperialism, we must also oppose Soviet modern revisionism."

	The three African freedom fighters expressed their firm belief that the Vietnamese people will definitely defeat U.S. imperialism and that final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people.

    非洲自由战士热烈欢呼毛主席给阮友寿的贺电
    毛主席为被压迫人民指出了斗争的方向
    新华社开罗二十二日电　一些非洲自由战士最近向新华社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿的贺电。他们一致指出，毛主席的贺电不仅是对正在同美帝国主义作斗争的英雄的越南人民的巨大鼓舞，而且也是对为争取解放而斗争的全世界一切被压迫人民的巨大鼓舞。他们认为只有走毛主席指出的武装斗争的道路，学习英雄的越南人民的光辉榜样，世界被压迫人民才能获得真正的解放。
    莫三鼻给革命委员会驻开罗代表西托尔说：“我们莫三鼻给人民从毛主席的贺电中受到极大的鼓舞。毛主席作为世界革命人民的伟大领袖非常了解亚非拉的斗争情况。在每个斗争的关键时刻，他总是代表七亿中国人民向斗争中的人民表示最坚决的支持。毛主席领导下的新中国，是世界革命的钢铁堡垒。”
    西托尔强调说：“正如毛主席教导我们，在战争中的决定性因素不是现代化武器而是人民。我们莫三鼻给人民同越南南方人民一样，只有进行人民战争，才能获得真正的解放。”
    西托尔谴责美帝国主义企图利用它的侵略工具联合国干涉越南事务。他说：“联合国无权干涉越南问题，越南问题只能由越南人民自己解决。”
    巴苏陀兰大会党驻开罗代表马帕法尼指出：“毛主席对越南人民的英勇斗争所给予的高度评价和对越南局势的精辟的分析，实在太英明了。这不仅极大地鼓舞了越南人民，而且为斗争中的人民指出了争取解放的真正道路。”
    马帕法尼说：美帝国主义在越南的侵略行动，是注定要失败的。越南人民的抗美救国斗争已经证明了美帝国主义是纸老虎。
    泛非主义者大会驻开罗代表塞贾克热情赞扬毛主席在贺电中的光辉论断：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”他说：这再次表明了毛主席是完全相信被压迫人民群众的。这使我想起了毛主席的另一个英明论断：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”
    塞贾克说：“毛主席的贺电，向全世界被压迫人民发出了同以美国为首的帝国主义作斗争的响亮号召。”
    塞贾克强烈谴责苏修对越南人民的假支持、真出卖。他说：“我们从苏修对越南人民斗争的叛卖中，从我们自己的经验中，得出了一个结论：反帝就必须反对苏联现代修正主义。”
    这三位非洲自由战士表示深信，越南人民一定能够打败美帝国主义，最后胜利必定属于越南人民。
