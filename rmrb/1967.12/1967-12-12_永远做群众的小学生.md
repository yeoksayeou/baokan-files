Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "Military units should have soldiers participate in study classes." The Shanghai-based Air Force units and many other units have followed this instruction, widely recruiting soldiers to participate in various levels of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Cadres and soldiers study together, live together, and work together, further promoting our military's revolutionary tradition of unity between officers and soldiers and between superiors and subordinates, presenting a new atmosphere of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. Their experience proves that this approach is excellent!

The greatest advantage of having soldiers participate in study classes is that it allows cadres to learn well from the soldiers, becoming students of the masses. In these study classes, cadres and soldiers together discuss the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, together criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and other top walkers of the capitalist road within the Party, together recall bitterness and sweetness, together apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, and engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. The soldiers' pure and profound class feelings of loving Chairman Mao, loving Mao Zedong Thought, and loving Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, their revolutionary spirit of studying Chairman Mao's works with great effort, daring to reveal their thoughts, and daring to engage in self-criticism, all powerfully promote the cadres' self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, and advance the cadres' ideological transformation.

Through joint study, cadres' understanding of Mao Zedong Thought has deepened, allowing them to correctly view themselves and correctly view the masses. Their bureaucratic tendencies have been eliminated, and their class feelings towards the soldiers have deepened; the soldiers have further seen the many strengths of the cadres, more comprehensively recognized the cadres, and have greater respect and care for the cadres. In this way, the fish-water relationship between cadres and the masses has been greatly strengthened.

Chairman Mao's latest instruction that military units should have soldiers participate in study classes is not only a major measure to address cadre issues through education at present but also points out the direction for future cadre education.

"The masses are the real heroes." "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." Cadres studying with soldiers, presenting their thoughts to the masses, seeking the masses' help, and drawing nourishment from the masses, is an important guarantee for the revolutionization of cadres' thoughts. Since Comrade Lin Biao advocated the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, our military cadres and soldiers have together studied and applied the "Old Three Articles," old soldiers guiding young soldiers, young soldiers helping old soldiers, breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, transforming their worldviews, and achieving great successes. This is a good example.

Being students of the masses, learning from the people, and coming from the masses and going to the masses, is Chairman Mao's consistent great thought and our Party and military's revolutionary tradition. Under Chairman Mao's personal leadership, our Party and military have long adhered to the leadership method of investigation and research, coming from the masses and going to the masses, the training method of officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers, the system of officers going to the ranks to be soldiers, etc. All of these embody a fundamental thought: cadres must be students of the masses.

In the period of socialist revolution, ensuring the revolutionization of the thoughts of cadres at all levels is the primary issue for preventing and guarding against revisionism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Strengthening the masses' help for cadres is more important than ever before. Today, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, and their proletarian awareness has been unprecedentedly raised. To keep up with the situation, our cadres must, more than ever before, pay more attention to learning from the masses. Military units having soldiers participate in study classes is a need of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a need of class struggle. We must not only do this today but must forever do this in the future.

The great People's Liberation Army, personally created by Chairman Mao and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is the iron wall defending the dictatorship of the proletariat and the main pillar for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. To enable our military to play a greater role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, further improve the relationship between superiors and subordinates and further improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. All new and old cadres in our military must take Chairman Mao's great practice as an example. Whether in study classes or at workstations, they must humbly learn from the soldiers and forever be students of the masses.

　　永远做群众的小学生
    毛主席最近指示我们：“军队办学习班要有战士参加。”驻上海空军部队和其他许多单位，遵照这个指示，广泛吸收战士参加各级举办的毛泽东思想学习班，干部和战士共同学习、共同生活、共同劳动，进一步发扬了我军官兵一致、上下一致的革命传统，呈现一片团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的新气象。他们的经验证明，这种做法好得很！
    学习班有战士参加的最大好处，就是可以通过这种方式，让干部很好地向战士学习，当群众的小学生。在这种学习班里，干部同战士一起讨论无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，一起狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义路线，一起忆苦思甜，一起活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修。战士们那种热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的纯朴而深厚的阶级感情，那种学习毛主席著作在用字上狠下功夫，敢于亮思想，敢于斗私心的革命精神，都有力地推动了干部的斗私批修，促进了干部的思想改造。
    通过共同学习，干部对毛泽东思想的认识更加深刻了，干部能够更加正确地对待自己、正确地对待群众了，官气打掉了，对战士的阶级感情加深了；战士们进一步看到了干部的许多长处，更加全面地认识了干部，对干部更加尊重、更加爱护了。这样，也就大大密切了干部和群众之间的鱼水关系。
    毛主席关于军队办学习班要有战士参加的最新指示，不仅是当前从教育着手解决干部问题的重大措施，而且指明了今后干部教育的方向。
    “群众是真正的英雄”。“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”干部同战士在一起学习，把自己的思想同群众见面，取得群众的帮助，从群众中吸取营养，这是干部思想革命化的一个重要保证。林彪同志倡导活学活用毛主席著作以来，我军干部、战士一起大学大用“老三篇”，老将带小将，小将帮老将，破私立公，改造世界观，取得了巨大成就，就是很好的证明。
    做群众的小学生，向人民群众学习，从群众中来、到群众中去，是毛主席一贯的伟大思想，是我党我军的革命传统。在毛主席亲自领导下，我党我军长期以来坚持实行的调查研究，从群众中来、到群众中去的领导方法，官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵的练兵方法，军官下连当兵的制度，等等，都贯串着一个根本思想，就是干部要做群众的小学生。
    在社会主义革命时期，保证各级领导干部思想革命化，是反修、防修，巩固无产阶级专政的首要问题。加强群众对干部的帮助，比以往任何时候都更加重要。今天，广大工农兵群众直接掌握了毛泽东思想，他们的无产阶级觉悟空前提高了。我们的干部要不落在形势的后面，也必须比以往任何时候都更加重视向群众学习。军队办学习班要有战士参加，这是无产阶级文化大革命的需要，阶级斗争的需要。我们不仅今天要这样做，今后也永远要这样做。
    毛主席亲自缔造的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民解放军，是保卫无产阶级专政的钢铁长城，是巩固无产阶级专政的主要支柱。为了我军能在无产阶级文化大革命中发挥更大的作用，就必须以毛泽东思想为指针，进一步搞好上下级关系，进一步搞好干群关系。我军一切新老干部，都要以毛主席的伟大实践为榜样，无论在学习班里还是在工作岗位上，都要虚心地向战士学习，永远做群众的一个小学生。　（十二月十二日）
