The Soviet revisionists have been loudly advocating "cultural cooperation" with the U.S. imperialists. This is a necessary product of their line of advocating "Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world" and pursuing a line of capitulationist "peaceful coexistence." It is also an important component of their capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union.

As early as 1956, Khrushchev, in his infamous 20th Congress of the CPSU, proposed: "We hope that in the struggle for peace and the security of all peoples, as well as in the economic and cultural fields, we can cooperate with the United States in a friendly manner."

Thus, a group of Soviet revisionist literary lackeys, following Khrushchev's tune, began to sing praises of "Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation." The notorious reactionary writer Sholokhov, in the tone of a lackey, fawned over the U.S. imperialists, saying: "Let us exchange visits! We have nothing to argue about or fight over." The old rightist Ehrenburg loudly proclaimed: "Any ideological differences should not become obstacles to cultural cooperation," and advocated the large-scale translation and publication of the "outstanding works" of American reactionary bourgeois writers.

Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet cultural exchange agreement in 1958, the frequency of mutual visits by cultural organizations, individuals, and performing groups of the Soviet revisionists and the U.S. imperialists has increased. Performances, book publications, various exhibitions, film exchanges, news openings, mutual gifts of cultural relics, and whatnot, such as "anniversary celebrations of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations," are truly diverse and endless.

The Soviet revisionist clique has been peddling a large number of works by American reactionary bourgeois writers, flooding Soviet publications. Taking just the first year of the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique's rule, 1965, as an example, nearly 60 Soviet publications carried over 220 Western literary works, a large number of which were American. The Soviet journal *Foreign Literature* proudly listed the works they published, such as *On the Road* by Jack Kerouac, the founder of the "beat generation," and *The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger, praising them as "the most outstanding works of these schools." The Soviet revisionist clique is using this spiritual opium to corrupt the revolutionary will of the Soviet people and carry out capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet revisionist clique's call to "open the windows" is a policy of open doors to the U.S. imperialists. The most reactionary, decadent, and filthy culture of the world, the U.S., has poured into the Soviet Union like a burst dam. "Voice of America," "jazz music," "abstract art," "modern art," "avant-garde theater," Hollywood films, rock 'n' roll, and so on, have flooded the Soviet Union.

In 1962, when the American Goodman Jazz Band performed in Moscow, Khrushchev personally attended and led the applause. This traitor told reporters: "I appreciate this music." Under Khrushcov's leadership, a "jazz craze" swept through Soviet society.

The Soviet revisionist clique used various propaganda machines and venues to peddle American rock 'n' roll, swing, twist, and other abnormal and obscene dances to the Soviet people, poisoning and corrupting them. They shamelessly praised these low-level vulgar actions as "miracles of the atomic age."

To show their achievements in learning from American imperialist art, the Soviet revisionists have also sent dance troupes to the U.S. more than once. In 1961, the Soviet Moiseyev Dance Troupe performed the twist in the U.S. The American *News Report* commented on this dance troupe's performance, saying: "Now we are no longer the leaders even in the twist." In June 1964, the American *Life* magazine commented on the scene of Soviet artists "learning" from American imperialist art, exclaiming: "Wow, such a thing, Moscow is learning from Broadway... Their movements and sparkling decorations can make any capitalist's pulse quicken." These comments from American newspapers show that Soviet culture and art have completely merged with American imperialist culture and art, becoming one and the same.

The Soviet stage is also filled with the "passion" of "Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation." The American yellow play *Two on a Swing* was also performed in Moscow. The Soviet revisionists staged American erotic plays such as *My Fair Lady* and *Bus Stop* on their own stage, and worked hard to perform these bad plays to the taste of their American masters. Soviet directors, when directing these plays, even had to "consider how Western guests would evaluate them." From this, one can see the shameless face of the Soviet revisionists as cultural appendages of American imperialism.

The Soviet revisionists have been even more enthusiastic in promoting American films. The Soviet revisionists not only extensively praised American films in various publications but also specially published books for reactionary American films to promote them widely. In 1965, the Soviet Ministry of Culture's Institute of Art History approved the publication of the book *Western Cinema on the Art of War*, which shamelessly praised American films that beautified the U.S. leaders and exonerated the U.S. policy of aggression and war, such as *Seven Days in May* and *The Nuremberg Trial*.

Since the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique came to power, to please their American masters, they have spent huge sums of money to purchase large quantities of American films. The Soviet revisionists even bought an American film *It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World* at a high price of 200,000 dollars. This film, which depicts a gang of robbers going crazy, was shown in 42 cinemas in Moscow. In addition, American films such as *The Magnificent Seven* and *The Green Man* also spread a large amount of poison among the Soviet people, especially corrupting the youth and leading them to crime. For such American spiritual opium, Soviet publications shamelessly praised their "success." On November 20, 1965, the *Soviet Culture News* shamelessly advocated studying the "secrets of success" of these American films to use for the "purposes and tasks" they needed. This is indeed their true intention.

Through "Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation," the U.S. often holds various exhibitions in the Soviet Union. From "abstract art" exhibitions to advertising exhibitions, even exhibiting strange clothes to attract customers. In 1959, the U.S. held the "Exhibition of Scientific and Cultural Achievements" in Moscow. American publications frankly admitted that its purpose was to propagandize the "superiority of private enterprise" and "arouse the desire of Soviet people to return to the capitalist system." However, Khrushchev, at the opening ceremony of this exhibition, advocated that it was "beneficial" to the Soviet Union and called on the Soviet Union to learn from the U.S. He said: "We regard the American exhibition as our own exhibition in the near future." This is truly a self-exposure! Khrushchev openly regarded the U.S. as the future of the Soviet Union, revealing that the fake communism he advocated, the "potato and beef stew" style, was the capitalist restoration he carried out in the Soviet Union.

From the above facts, it can be seen that a large number of American cultural products such as music, dance, film, literature, and theater have indeed created a record of the highest cultural trade volume in the history of international relations. The American *Time* magazine reported on October 26, 1962: "Moscow is dizzy under the unprecedented strong cultural offensive of the U.S." The *New York Herald Tribune* also said on July 5, 1965: "Russia is suffering from the invasion of American culture." Look, the invaders do not hide their faces at all. However, the Soviet revisionist lackeys who have lost their sovereignty and accepted the cultural invasion of American imperialism pretend not to hear these words. They have played tricks to cover up their shameful crimes of thoroughly surrendering to American imperialism through "cultural cooperation."

One of these tricks is Khrushchev's so-called "ideological coexistence is impossible." The Soviet revisionists put on a show of "inability to coexist," but in reality, they are thoroughly surrendering to the cultural invasion and "ideological infiltration" of American imperialism. After the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique came to power, they did not even want the cover of "inability to coexist." After they came to power, the first editorial in *Pravda* on cultural policy did not even mention the word "party spirit" that the Soviet revisionists used to hang on their lips, and the high tune of "ideological coexistence is impossible" was completely silent. The American *New York Herald Tribune* said that the Soviet revisionists no longer talk about the "ideological subversive danger" of American culture. This shows that the Soviet revisionists have openly stood on the same side as American imperialism. They themselves are the accomplices of American imperialism's cultural invasion of the Soviet Union. The so-called "Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation" is the manifestation of the counter-revolutionary collusion between the Soviet revisionists and American imperialism in the cultural field.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will." No matter how the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists collude and act arbitrarily, their days are getting worse and worse. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has sounded the death knell for them. The great Soviet people will surely, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, rise up in rebellion against the Soviet revisionist ruling clique and sweep away all the American reactionary cultural poisons that the successors of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk have brought in through the "cultural cooperation" route!

    如此苏美“文化合作”
    范道底
    苏修大肆鼓吹同美帝搞“文化合作”，这是苏修追求“苏美合作主宰世界”，推行“和平共处”的投降主义总路线的必然产物，也是他们在苏联大搞资本主义复辟的一个重要组成部分。
    早在一九五六年，赫鲁晓夫就在臭名昭著的苏共二十大提出：“我们希望在为和平和各国人民的安全的斗争方面，以及在经济和文化方面，同美国友好合作。”
    于是，一批苏修御用文人，按照赫鲁晓夫的调调，唱起苏美“文化合作”的赞美诗来。臭名远扬的反动作家肖洛霍夫，用奴才的腔调向美帝献媚说：“让我们互相来往吧！我们没有什么可争论和斗争的。”老右派爱伦堡大肆叫嚷：“任何思想上的分歧都不应该成为文化合作的障碍”，并且鼓吹大量翻译出版美国反动资产阶级作家的“杰出作品”。
    自从一九五八年苏美文化交流协定签字后，苏修美帝的文化团体、个人以及演出单位的相互访问活动，日益频繁。演出、出版书籍、举办各式各样的展览会、交换电影、开放新闻、互赠文物，还有什么“俄美建交周年纪念”等等，真是五花八门，无奇不有。
    苏修集团贩运大量的美国反动资产阶级作家的作品，充斥苏修报刊。仅就勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团上台后的第一年即一九六五年为例，苏修近六十种报刊登载了西方文学作品二百二十余篇，其中大量的是美国货。苏联《外国文学》杂志如数家珍地列举他们发表美国“垮掉的一代”创始人克鲁亚克的《在路上》、塞林格的《麦田守望者》等反动作品，吹捧它们是“这些流派最杰出的代表作”。苏修集团就是要利用这种精神鸦片，来腐蚀苏联人民的革命意志，在苏联大搞资本主义复辟。
    苏修集团叫嚷“把窗户打开”，就是对美帝实行门户开放政策。世界上最反动、最腐朽、最肮脏的美帝文化，象决了口的浊水一样，一股脑儿涌进苏联。什么“美国之音”，“爵士音乐”，“抽象派”、“现代派”绘画，“先锋派”戏剧，好莱坞电影，阿飞舞等等，充斥苏联。
    一九六二年美国古德曼爵士乐队在莫斯科演出时，赫鲁晓夫亲自出马捧场，带头鼓掌。这个大叛徒对新闻记者说：“我欣赏这种音乐”。在赫鲁晓夫的倡导下，苏联社会上掀起了一股“爵士狂”。
    苏修集团利用各种宣传机器和场所，向苏联人民推销美国的阿飞舞、摇摆舞、扭摆舞等病态和猥亵的舞蹈，用以毒害和腐蚀苏联人民。他们恬不知耻地吹捧这种低级下流的动作“已成为原子世纪的奇迹”。
    苏修为了显示向美帝国主义的艺术学习的成绩，还不止一次地派舞蹈团赴美。一九六一年苏修莫伊塞耶夫舞蹈团在美国演出了摇摆舞。美国《新闻报》在评论这家舞蹈团的演出时说：“现在我们甚至在摇摆舞方面也不是领先了。”一九六四年六月，美国《生活》杂志评论苏修艺术家向美帝国主义的艺术“学习”的情景时赞叹：“唷，真有这样的事，莫斯科开始学起百老汇来了……，他们的动作和闪闪发光的装饰可以使任何资本家的脉搏加快。”美国报刊的这些评论，表明苏修的文化艺术已经同美帝国主义的文化艺术完全同流合污，成为一路货了。
    苏联的戏剧舞台，同样充满着苏美“文化合作”的“激情”。美国黄色戏《两个打秋千的人》也曾经在莫斯科上演。苏修把《窈窕淑女》、《公共汽车站》等色情的美国戏，搬上自己的舞台，同时还煞费苦心，竭力把这些坏戏演得符合美国主子的口味。而苏修的导演们在导演这些戏时，甚至还要“考虑到西方客人怎样评价”。从这里人们可以看出苏修已堕落为美帝文化附庸的无耻嘴脸。
    苏修在推销美国电影方面，更是不遗余力。苏修不仅通过各种报刊大肆吹捧美国影片，而且专门为反动的美国电影出版书籍，广为宣传。一九六五年苏修文化部艺术史研究所批准出版的《西方关于战争的电影艺术》一书，对于美化美帝头子、为美帝侵略政策和战争政策开脱罪责的美国影片《五月的七天》、《纽伦堡审判》等，作了肉麻的吹捧。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团当政以来，为了讨好美国主子，不惜花费巨资购买大批美国影片。苏修竟以二十万美元的高价，买了一部《这是疯狂、疯狂、疯狂的世界》的美国片。这部描写一伙强盗发疯的影片，曾在莫斯科的四十二家影院上映。此外，描写凶杀案的《七好汉》、《绿街小舍》等美国片，也在苏联人民中散布了大量毒素，特别是腐蚀了青少年，使他们走上犯罪的道路。对于这样一些美国精神鸦片，苏修报刊竟然大肆吹捧它们的“成功”。一九六五年十一月二十日《苏维埃文化报》无耻鼓吹，要研究这些美国影片的“成功奥秘”，以用于苏修“所需要的目的和任务”。这也的确是他们的真心话。
    通过美苏“文化合作”，美国还经常在苏联举办各种展览会。从“抽象派”画展到广告展览，甚至展出奇装异服，招徕顾客。一九五九年美国在莫斯科举办的“科技和文化成就展览会”，美国报刊直言不讳地供认，其目的就是宣扬“私人经营的优越性”，“煽起苏联人回到资本主义制度的愿望”。而赫鲁晓夫却在这个展览会的开幕式上鼓吹它对苏联是“有益的”，号召苏联向美国学习。他说：“我们把美国展览会看作是在不久的将来我们自己的展览会”。真是不打自招！赫鲁晓夫公然把美国当作苏联的未来，一语道破了他所鼓吹的“土豆烧牛肉”式的假共产主义，就是他在苏联所实行的资本主义的复辟。
    从以上事实可以看出，美帝国主义的音乐、舞蹈、电影、文学、戏剧等等大量“文化食品”在苏联上市，的确开创了国际关系史上文化交易额的最高纪录。美国《时代》周刊一九六二年十月二十六日报道说：“莫斯科正在美国空前强大的文化攻势之下晕头转向”。一九六五年七月五日《纽约先驱论坛报》也说：“俄国正在遭受美国文化的入侵”。请看，侵略者一点也不掩盖他的侵略者的面目。而丧权辱国、接受美帝文化侵略的苏修奴才，却对这些话装作听不见。他们耍起了障眼术，企图掩盖自己与美国大搞“文化合作”、向美帝彻底投降的可耻罪行。
    这种障眼术之一，就是赫鲁晓夫曾经叫嚷的所谓“意识形态不能和平共处”。苏修摆出一副“不能共处”的架子，实际上干着向美帝的文化侵略、“思想渗透”彻底投降的勾当。勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团上台以后，更是连“不能共处”这块遮羞布也不要了。他们上台后，《真理报》第一篇阐述文化政策方面的社论，连以前苏修挂在嘴边装装样子的“党性”这一字眼也不见了，什么“意识形态不能和平共处”的高调更是无声无息。美国《纽约先驱论坛报》说过，苏修已经不再谈论美国文化有什么“思想意识上的颠覆性的危险了”。这表明苏修已公然与美帝站在同一个立场上，他们本身就是美帝对苏联进行文化侵略的帮凶。所谓苏美“文化合作”，也就是苏美反革命勾结在文化领域中的表现。
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”不管苏修与美帝怎样狼狈为奸，横行霸道，但是他们的日子越来越不好过了。中国无产阶级文化大革命敲响了他们的丧钟。伟大的苏联人民，总有一天会在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，大造苏修统治集团的反，把赫鲁晓夫的继任者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，以及他们通过“文化合作”的途径贩运进来的美国反动文化毒品，统统扫除干净！
