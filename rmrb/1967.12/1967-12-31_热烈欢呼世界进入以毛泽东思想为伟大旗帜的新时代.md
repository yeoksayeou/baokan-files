Edition: 5

On the eve of the New Year, the editorial department of this newspaper invited some workers, peasants, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and Red Guards from the capital to discuss the current international situation. The comrades participating in the discussion spoke with great excitement about the great international significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, praised the great victories of revolutionary struggles by the peoples of various countries, and warmly celebrated the world entering a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to analyze the development of the international class struggle over the past year and unanimously pointed out that the current situation in the world is one of a great upsurge of the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. The following is a summary of their speeches:

A Year of Great Development in the World People's Revolutionary Movement

Comrades Ma Changlin from the Beijing Knitting Factory and Gong Baojun from the Beijing Institute of Geology said: The current international situation is very good. The general trend is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. 1967 was a year when the invincible Mao Zedong Thought was more widely spread and deeply rooted in the hearts of people around the world. It was a year when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China scored great victories. It was a year of great development in the world people's revolutionary movement. The overall situation is better than ever before. "The four seas are in turmoil, and the clouds are angry; the five continents are shaken, and the thunder roars." Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the storms in Asia, the war drums in Africa, the flames of rage in Latin America, and the waves of anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles by the peoples of various countries are shaking the "thrones" of imperialism and its running dogs, and fiercely impacting the entire old world. The current great situation further proves the profound judgment of our great leader Chairman Mao: "American imperialism and all other harmful creatures have already prepared their own gravediggers, and the day of their burial will not be far off."

The Wide Spread of Mao Zedong Thought Around the World
Is the Most Important Sign of the Great Situation in the International Arena

Comrades Zhang Shuzhi from the Beijing Third Rolling Mill, Feng Mingju from the Beijing Postage Stamp Factory, and Dong Shuliang from a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region said in their speeches: One of the most important signs of the current great situation in the international arena is that Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread and deeply rooted in the hearts of people around the world. The great Mao Zedong Thought is like a beacon shining brightly, illuminating the path forward for the world's revolutionary peoples. Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people but also the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary peoples. Mao Zedong Thought is not only a powerful ideological weapon for the Chinese people but also a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary peoples of the whole world. In the hearts of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao is the contemporary Lenin, the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples. The revolutionary peoples of the whole world deeply love our great leader Chairman Mao from the bottom of their hearts and enthusiastically study the works of Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought, combined with hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, is turning into a great material force. The spread of Mao Zedong Thought around the world is something that no reactionary force can stop.

Comrade Qin Zhigang from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics said: In human history, there has never been anything like Mao Zedong Thought being so widely spread around the world and grasped and used by the broad masses of the people. More and more revolutionary peoples are recognizing this truth: with Mao Zedong Thought in hand, the revolution will be victorious; without Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution will fail.

Comrade Hou Bilong from a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region said: When we stand guard at Tiananmen, we deeply feel the boundless love of the revolutionary peoples of the whole world for our great leader Chairman Mao. Foreign friends hold up Chairman Mao's quotations and come to Tiananmen. They take photos under Chairman Mao's giant portrait, read the quotations, sing the quotations songs, and wish Chairman Mao eternal life! They are reluctant to leave for a long time. This makes us deeply feel that we are not only guarding Tiananmen but also defending Chairman Mao and defending the lighthouse of the world revolution.

The Great Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China
Shakes the World

Comrade Zhou Jianrong from the direct-affiliated units of the Navy said: When we say that the international situation is great and unprecedentedly good, we cannot separate it from the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Now, for the whole world, the greatest thing is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The revolutionary peoples of the whole world are overjoyed and applaud it; the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries are terrified and curse it. This shows the profound influence and great impact of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the world. The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has greatly encouraged the peoples of various countries who are fighting for liberation. Through this great revolution, socialist China, as the center of the world revolution, has become even stronger and more consolidated, and we have more power to support the revolutionary cause of the peoples of various countries in the world.

Comrade Liang Shu from the Beijing Third Rolling Mill said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has extremely profound historical significance and great international significance. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has solved the problem of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in theory and practice. This not only consolidates the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, prevents the restoration of capitalism in China, but also opens up a path to communism for the peoples of the whole world.

Comrade Teng Tianyu from a certain unit of the Air Force of the Beijing Military Region said: The proletariat seizes political power through Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletariat consolidates political power also through Mao Zedong Thought. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has opened up a new era in the international communist movement and opened up a brilliant path from socialism to communism. This is a very important sign of the development of Marxism-Leninism to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary peoples of the whole world warmly celebrate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. They are inspired and see hope from this great revolution. While the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries hate and fear the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they launch wave after wave of anti-China campaigns. This precisely shows that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has dealt them a heavy blow.

The World Marxist-Leninist Forces
Are Continuously Growing Stronger

Comrades Zuo Jun and Zhang Changcai from the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune said in their speeches: In the struggle against imperialism and revisionism by Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples around the world, the Albanian Party of Labor and the Albanian people have set up a brilliant red banner. Under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have fought tenaciously against imperialism and its slaves and henchmen. They have withstood the current of modern revisionism and defended Marxism-Leninism. Over the past year, the Albanian people's revolutionary movement has achieved great victories. They have overcome difficulties, increased grain production, waged war on the mountains, and taken grain from the mountains, achieving great success. The Albanian people are truly heroic people.

Comrades Ma Changlin from the Beijing Knitting Factory and Yang Kaimin from the Beijing Hoisting Machinery Factory said in their speeches: Chairman Mao said: "To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party." Revolutionaries in many countries around the world, with Mao Zedong Thought as their guide, have come out of the struggle against revisionism and established Marxist-Leninist parties or groups. Where there is revisionism, there will definitely be Marxist-Leninists to fight against it. This is inevitable. These newly established parties and groups, although their numbers are still relatively small, are new forces that are invincible. They will definitely develop and grow stronger rapidly in the revolutionary struggle.

The Flames of Armed Struggle in Asia, Africa, and Latin America
Are Burning More and More Fiercely

Comrades Lin Xianbin and Teng Tianyu from a certain unit of the Air Force of the Beijing Military Region said in their speeches: Vietnam is the focus of the current anti-American struggle. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war has exposed the paper tiger of American imperialism and set a brilliant example for the peoples of the whole world. The Vietnamese people are fighting well! The revolutionary peoples of the whole world have further recognized Chairman Mao's profound judgment from the great victory of the Vietnamese people: "Regardless of the size of a country, as long as the people are fully mobilized, firmly rely on the people, and wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated."

Comrades Yang Kaimin from the Beijing Hoisting Machinery Factory and Yang Hongkuan from the Beijing Forestry University said in their speeches: The surging tide of the national liberation movement in the world is an important part of the current great situation in the international arena. According to Chairman Mao's teaching of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," the peoples of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have taken up arms and decided to follow the path of the Chinese revolution. Currently, the flames of armed struggle are burning fiercely in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Especially in Southeast Asia, the peoples of Laos, Burma, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaya, and other countries are fighting armed struggles victoriously and achieving new victories; the peoples of India and Indonesia have also raised the torch of armed struggle and are building or preparing to build base areas in the countryside. On the African continent, the peoples of the Congo (Kinshasa) and other countries are continuing their anti-imperialist revolutionary armed struggles. In the backyard of American imperialism, Latin America, more and more peoples of countries are taking up arms to fight against American imperialism and its running dogs. News of victory keeps coming, making people excited and greatly inspired.

Comrade Xiang Baojin from a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region said: In the past, modern revisionists vigorously peddled the black goods of "peaceful transition" and "parliamentary road," causing great harm to the revolutionary cause of the peoples of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Now, the market for this revisionist goods is getting smaller and smaller. More and more revolutionaries, through their own struggle practice, have further recognized that armed struggle is the only reliable road for oppressed nations and peoples to struggle for liberation. The brilliant military thought of Chairman Mao is having a greater and greater impact in the regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The Days of the American Imperialists and Soviet Revisionists Are Getting Worse and Worse

Comrade Liu Shoucai from the Machang Village Production Brigade of Cuicun People's Commune in Changping County said in his speech: I have lived in the old society and seen a lot of the ugly faces of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Before liberation, American imperialism was rampant in China, hated and cursed by the Chinese people. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people united and overthrew them and drove them out. American imperialism is rampant around the world and will inevitably face fierce resistance from the peoples of various countries. Now, American imperialism is like a rat crossing the street, everyone wants to beat it. Its days are numbered.

Comrades Wang Xingxue from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Hou Bilong from a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region said in their speeches: American imperialism is beaten up everywhere abroad, and its class contradictions at home are also becoming more acute. The black struggle is booming, the people strongly oppose the Vietnam War, and the youth refuse to go to Vietnam to be cannon fodder. The days of the Johnson administration are getting worse and worse. The infighting between American imperialism and other imperialist countries is also getting more intense. Just as our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The various irreconcilable contradictions at home and abroad are like a volcano that threatens American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano."

Comrades Liang Shu, Cao Zhenhua, and Zhang Shoushan from the direct-affiliated units of the Navy said in their speeches: The Soviet revisionist clique is the accomplice of American imperialism. It actively supports American imperialism in suppressing the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, wearing the cloak of the Communist Party, is the most dangerous enemy of the international communist movement and the revolutionary peoples of the world. In the past year, its series of treacherous acts in the Vietnam issue, the Middle East incident, and the Glassboro talks have made the peoples of the world more aware of the renegade face of the Soviet revisionist clique. The baton of the Soviet revisionists is also becoming less effective. Modern revisionism is "colliding" internally. The Soviet revisionist clique is fully implementing the restoration of capitalism at home, making the Soviet Union a mess. The days of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like are also getting worse and worse.

Comrade Ge Zhongbo from the Beijing Postage Stamp Factory said: Now, the peoples of various countries are increasingly recognizing that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism. True Marxist-Leninists must draw a clear line with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, thoroughly expose it, and resolutely overthrow it. There is no middle road to take.

The Reactionary Tide Will Never Become the Mainstream

Comrades Shen Dehou from the Beijing Hoisting Machinery Factory and Xie Jincai from the Beijing Third Rolling Mill said in their speeches: Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "At present, the reactionary tide attempts to overwhelm the mainstream of national independence and people's democracy, but the reactionary tide will never become the mainstream." The current mainstream of the world situation is the deepening development of the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries. The counter-revolutionary tide launched by imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries cannot stop the surging forward of the revolutionary torrent. In the past year, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries have fiercely attacked China. However, as Chairman Mao taught us: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." The more they oppose us, the more it proves that we are right. No matter how fiercely they attack China, they cannot harm us in the slightest. We see clearly that those who attack China are only a small handful of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries. The broad masses of the people are friendly to China. The revolutionary peoples of various countries all look to the world revolution center—the great socialist China, the China of Mao Zedong Thought. Our friends are all over the world.

Comrade Lei Fubian from the Beijing Forestry University said: Those who attack China will definitely meet a bad end. Khrushchev attacked China and was finished. Nehru attacked China and was finished. Now, those clowns who attack China will also be finished.

Supporting the Revolutionary Struggles of the World's Peoples
Is Our Internationalist Duty

Comrades Ge Zhongbo from the Beijing Postage Stamp Factory and Zuo Jun from the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune said in their speeches: Chairman Mao often teaches us: "The peoples who have already won the revolution should aid the struggle of the peoples who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." China is the base of the world people's revolution, and our great capital Beijing is the revolutionary center that the peoples of the world yearn for. We feel infinite happiness and pride living by the side of Chairman Mao. We must firmly remember the internationalist duty of the Chinese people. We must spread Mao Zedong Thought to the world, so that the world's revolutionary peoples can grasp the powerful ideological weapon of struggle. We workers and peasants must resolutely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, grasp the revolution, promote production, and support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world with actual actions. We produce one more screw, harvest one more pound of wheat, and contribute one more to the world revolutionary cause.

Comrades Li Yanhui and Xin Zhen from Beijing No. 23 Middle School said in their speeches: The revolutionary peoples of the world have great expectations for us Red Guards, and we feel the burden on our shoulders is heavy. We must do a good job of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought the guiding principle for everything, and strongly supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. We must do the following: "If Chairman Mao loves me, I love him; if Chairman Mao supports me, I support him; if Chairman Mao instructs me, I follow; if Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance."

Comrades Qin Zhigang from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Yuan Changqing from the Beijing Institute of Geology, and Yang Hongkuan from the Beijing Forestry University said in their speeches: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great support for the world revolution. We Red Guards who have made great contributions in the Cultural Revolution are determined to, together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. In the new year, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self" as the key link, and achieve an all-around victory in the Cultural Revolution, making our country an even stronger and more consolidated red base for the world revolution.

Comrade Xiang Baojin from a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region said: We are soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China. We are not only revolutionaries of China but also revolutionaries of the world. As soon as our great leader Chairman Mao gives the order, we will rush to wherever he points, support the revolutionary struggles of the world's peoples, and carry the world revolution through to the end. We will forever remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The peoples of the world, unite! Beat back the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! The peoples of the world must have courage, dare to fight, not fear difficulties, advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be destroyed."

    热烈欢呼世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代
    首都工人、农民、解放军战士、红卫兵小将座谈国际大好形势
    新年前夕，本报编辑部邀请首都的一些工人、农民、解放军战士、红卫兵小将，就当前的国际形势举行了座谈。参加座谈的同志们，以万分兴奋的心情，畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的伟大国际意义，赞扬各国人民革命斗争的伟大胜利，热烈欢呼世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，分析了一年来国际阶级斗争形势的发展，一致指出当前世界上是一派东风压倒西风的大好形势。现将他们的发言摘要发表如下：
    世界人民革命运动大发展的一年
    北京针织总厂马长林、北京地质学院宫保军在发言中说：目前国际形势是一片大好。总的趋势是东风压倒西风。一九六七年，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界更加广泛传播、深入人心的一年，是中国无产阶级文化大革命凯歌高奏的一年，是世界人民革命运动大发展的一年。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，亚洲的风暴，非洲的战鼓，拉丁美洲的怒火，各国人民反帝反修斗争的浪潮，正在摇撼着帝国主义及其走狗的“宝座”，猛烈地冲击着整个旧世界。目前的大好形势进一步证明了我们的伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”
      毛泽东思想在全世界广泛传播
  是国际形势大好的最重要标志
    北京第三轧钢厂张树仲、北京邮票厂冯鸣举、北京部队某部董树良在发言中认为：当前国际形势大好的一个最重要标志，是毛泽东思想在全世界广泛传播，深入人心。伟大的毛泽东思想象一盏光芒四射的明灯，给世界革命人民照亮了前进的道路。毛主席不仅是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是世界革命人民心中的红太阳。毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民的强大思想武器，也是全世界革命人民的强大思想武器。在世界革命人民的心目中，毛主席就是当代的列宁，是世界革命人民的伟大旗手。全世界革命人民从内心深处无比热爱伟大领袖毛主席，热情学习毛主席著作。毛泽东思想同亿万革命群众相结合，正在变成巨大的物质力量。毛泽东思想在全世界的传播，是任何反动力量也无法阻挡的。
    北京航空学院秦志强说：在人类历史上，从来没有象毛泽东思想这样在全世界广泛传播，并为广大人民群众所掌握和运用。越来越多的革命人民认识到这样一个真理：掌握了毛泽东思想，革命就会胜利；背离了毛泽东思想，革命就会失败。
    北京部队某部侯必龙说：我们在天安门前站岗时，深深感到全世界革命人民对我们的伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱。外国朋友高举着毛主席语录牌来到天安门，他们在毛主席的巨幅画像下，照像，读语录，高唱语录歌，祝福毛主席万寿无疆！久久不愿离去。这使我们深刻地体会到，我们不仅是在守卫天安门，而且也是在保卫毛主席，保卫世界革命的灯塔。
      中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大
  胜利震动了世界
    海军直属机关周建功说：我们说国际形势大好，空前地好，是离不开中国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势的。现在对整个世界说来，最大的事情莫过于中国无产阶级文化大革命了。全世界革命人民为之欢欣鼓舞，拍手叫好；帝修反则丧魂失魄，切齿咒骂。这说明我国无产阶级文化大革命对世界影响之深，震动之大。我国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利，给正在为争取解放而进行革命斗争的各国人民以极大鼓舞。经过这场伟大的革命，作为世界革命中心的社会主义中国更加强大和巩固，我们就更有力量支援世界各国人民的革命事业。
    北京第三轧钢厂梁恕说：中国无产阶级文化大革命有极其深远的历史意义和伟大的国际意义。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，在理论上和实践上解决了无产阶级专政条件下继续革命的问题。这不仅巩固了中国的无产阶级专政，防止了资本主义在中国复辟，而且为全世界人民开辟了通往共产主义的航道。
    北京部队空军某部滕天余说：无产阶级夺取政权要靠毛泽东思想，无产阶级巩固政权也要靠毛泽东思想。我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，开辟了国际共产主义运动的新纪元，开辟了由社会主义通向共产主义的光辉航道。这是马克思列宁主义发展到毛泽东思想阶段的一个极其重要的标志。全世界革命人民热烈欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命，他们从这场大革命中得到了鼓舞，看到了希望。而帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派对我国无产阶级文化大革命，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，恨得要命，怕得要死，掀起一次又一次的反华浪潮。这恰恰说明我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利给他们以沉重的打击。
      世界马克思列宁主义的队伍
    不断壮大
    中阿友好人民公社左军、张长才在发言中说：在全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民反帝反修的斗争中，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民树立了一面鲜艳的红旗。在伟大的马克思列宁主义者霍查同志的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民同帝国主义及其奴仆和爪牙进行了顽强的斗争。他们顶住了现代修正主义的逆流，捍卫了马克思列宁主义。一年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命化运动取得了伟大的胜利。他们克服困难，增产粮食，向山宣战，向山要粮，也取得了很大的成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民真不愧是英雄的人民。
    北京针织总厂马长林、北京起重机厂杨开民在发言中说：毛主席说：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。”世界许多国家的革命者，以毛泽东思想为指导，从反对修正主义的斗争中杀了出来，建立了马克思列宁主义政党或小组。哪里有修正主义，哪里就会有马克思列宁主义者起来同它进行斗争，这是必然的。这些新建立的政党和小组，目前人数虽然还比较少，但这是新生的力量，是不可战胜的力量。它们一定会在革命斗争中迅速发展壮大起来。
      亚非拉各国人民武装斗争的烈火
  越烧越旺
    北京部队空军某部林宪彬、滕天余在发言中说：越南是当前反美斗争的焦点。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，戳穿了美帝国主义纸老虎，为全世界人民树立了光辉的榜样。越南人民打得好！全世界革命人民都从越南人民的伟大胜利中，更加认识到毛主席的英明论断：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”
    北京起重机厂杨开民、北京林学院杨洪宽在发言中说：世界民族解放运动的高涨，是目前国际形势大好的重要部分。根据毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，亚非拉许多国家人民，纷纷拿起枪杆子，决心走中国革命的道路。目前，武装斗争的烈火，正在亚非拉许多国家熊熊燃烧。特别是在东南亚，老挝、缅甸、泰国、菲律宾、马来亚等国人民，胜利地坚持武装斗争，不断取得新的胜利；印度和印尼人民也举起了武装斗争的火炬，正在农村建立或准备建立根据地。在非洲大陆，刚果（金）人民和其他一些国家的人民的反帝革命武装斗争，也在继续发展。在美帝国主义的后院拉丁美洲，越来越多的国家的人民拿起武器大造美帝国主义及其走狗的反。胜利的消息不断传来，令人欢欣鼓舞，无比振奋。
    北京部队某部相宝进说：过去，现代修正主义者竭力贩卖“和平过渡”和“议会道路”的黑货，给亚非拉许多国家的人民革命事业造成了很大危害。现在这种修正主义的货色市场越来越小。许许多多的革命者通过自己的斗争实践进一步认识到，武装斗争是被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的唯一可靠的道路。毛主席的光辉军事思想在亚非拉地区，正在产生日益巨大的影响。
    美帝苏修的日子越来越不好过
    昌平县崔村公社麻峪大队刘守才在发言中说：我是在旧社会生活过的人，对帝国主义、蒋介石反动派的丑恶嘴脸看得多了。解放前，美帝国主义在中国横行霸道，遭到中国人民的痛恨和咒骂。中国人民在毛主席和共产党的领导下，团结起来，把它们打倒了，赶走了。美帝国主义在全世界横行霸道，也必然要遭到各国人民的激烈反抗。现在，美帝国主义象过街老鼠，人人喊打。它的寿命不长了。
    北京航空学院王兴学、北京部队某部侯必龙在发言中说：美帝国主义在国外处处挨打，国内的阶级矛盾也日益加剧。黑人斗争蓬勃展开，人民强烈反对侵越战争，青年拒绝到越南去当炮灰。约翰逊政府的日子越来越不好过。美帝国主义同其他帝国主义国家之间的勾心斗角，也更加厉害了。正象我们伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”
    北京第三轧钢厂梁恕、曹振华、海军直属机关章寿山在发言中指出：苏修集团是美帝国主义的帮凶，它积极支持美帝国主义镇压世界各国人民的革命运动。苏修叛徒集团披着共产党的外衣，是国际共产主义运动和世界革命人民的最危险的敌人。在过去一年中，它在越南问题、中东事件和葛拉斯堡罗会谈中的一系列叛卖行径，使全世界人民更认清了苏修集团的叛徒嘴脸。苏修的指挥棒也越来越不灵了。现代修正主义内部正在“撞车”。苏修集团在国内全面实行资本主义复辟，把苏联搞得一团糟。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的日子也越来越不好过了。
    北京邮票厂戈中博说：现在，各国革命人民越来越认识到，反帝必须反修。真正的马克思列宁主义者必须同以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义划清界线，彻底揭露，坚决打倒，决没有中间道路可走。
    反动的逆流终究不会变为主流
    北京起重机厂沈德厚、北京第三轧钢厂谢金才在发言中说：我们的伟大领袖毛主席说过：“目前反动的逆流企图压倒民族独立和人民民主的主流，但反动的逆流终究不会变为主流。”当前世界形势的主流是各国人民革命运动的深入发展，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派掀起的反革命逆流，决不能阻挡革命洪流的滚滚向前。在过去一年中，帝修反疯狂反华。但是，正如毛主席教导我们的：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”敌人越是反对我们，就越是证明我们做得对。不管他们怎样猖狂地反华，也损伤不了我们的一根毫毛。我们看得很清楚，反华的只是一小撮帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和反动派，广大的人民是同中国友好的。各国革命人民都心向世界的革命中心——伟大的社会主义的中国，毛泽东思想的中国。我们的朋友遍天下。
    北京林学院雷福建说：凡是反华的人，决没有好下场。赫鲁晓夫反华，完蛋了。尼赫鲁反华，完蛋了。现在那些反华的小丑们也终究要完蛋的。
        支援世界人民的革命斗争
    是我们的国际主义义务
    北京邮票厂戈中博、中阿友好人民公社左军在发言中说：毛主席经常教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”中国是世界人民革命的根据地，我们的伟大首都北京是世界人民向往的革命中心。我们生活在毛主席的身边感到无限的幸福和自豪。我们一定要牢牢记住中国人民的国际主义义务。我们要向全世界传播毛泽东思想，使世界革命人民掌握斗争的强大的思想武器。我们工人和农民，一定坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，用实际行动，全力支持世界上一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。我们多生产一颗螺丝钉，多收获一斤麦子，就是对世界革命事业多作出一分贡献。
    北京二十三中李彦莉、辛珍在发言中表示：世界革命人民对我们红卫兵抱着很大希望，我们感到身上的担子很重。我们要好好地宣传毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想统帅一切，大力支援世界各国人民的革命斗争。我们一定要做到：“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
    北京航空学院秦志强、北京地质学院袁长清、北京林学院杨洪宽在发言中说：中国无产阶级文化大革命是对世界革命的极大支持。我们在文化大革命中作出重大贡献的红卫兵，决心与全国工农兵一道，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。在新的一年中，我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，夺取文化大革命的全面胜利，使我们的国家成为更加强大、更加巩固的世界革命的红色根据地。
    北京部队某部相宝进说：我们是中国人民解放军的战士。我们不仅要做中国的革命派，还要做世界的革命派。只要伟大领袖毛主席一声令下，他老人家指向哪里，我们就奔向哪里，支援世界人民的革命斗争，把世界革命进行到底。我们永远牢记毛主席的教导：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
