Workers and cadres across the coal industry in Heilongjiang Province have been vigorously promoting production while focusing on revolution. Coal production has been steadily increasing. Since November, the daily coal production has significantly risen. The daily output in the first and middle of the month increased by 8.5% compared to October, and in the latter part of the month, it surged by another 26%. Currently, an increasing number of mines have exceeded their state production quotas.

Inspired by the central leadership's letter to the coal industry workers, the broad masses of coal miners in Heilongjiang Province are filled with enthusiasm and vigor. They are further implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Competition for high production has been launched among mines, shafts, and teams. Workers and cadres are all actively participating, striving to produce more coal. The largest coal mine in the province, Jixi Mine, has seen a significant increase in its average daily coal output since late November.

The coal industry workers have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. They have quickly established many Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The province's coal mines have already held over 200 sessions of full-time and part-time study classes, with more than 10,000 participants. Armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, using the "Three Articles" as their guiding principles, they are fiercely fighting against selfishness and vigorously criticizing revisionism, significantly raising their class consciousness. Many miners take the People's Liberation Army as their example, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Workers at Shuangyashan Coal Mine carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles" with them when they go underground to work. They say, "With the 'Three Articles,' we have boundless strength." Through the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, the revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination have been greatly consolidated and developed. Ninety-four percent of the original leaders at the bureau, mine, shaft, and section levels in Shuangyashan Mine Bureau have stepped forward, and many revolutionary cadres have been absorbed into the three-in-one combination temporary power organs to take on leadership roles. A new atmosphere of more participation in labor and adherence to the mass line has emerged among the cadres. A new relationship between the cadres and the masses is being established.

    工人干部齐上阵斗志昂扬多采煤
    黑龙江煤炭日产水平大幅度上升
    据新华社哈尔滨三十日电　黑龙江省煤炭工业战线广大革命职工，狠抓革命，猛促生产，煤炭生产蒸蒸日上。进入十一月份以来，煤炭日产水平大幅度上升，上、中旬日产量比十月份增长百分之八点五，下旬又比上、中旬猛增百分之二十六。现在，越来越多的矿井超额完成了国家计划。
    黑龙江省广大煤矿职工，在中央给煤炭工业战线职工的信的鼓舞下，斗志昂扬，干劲冲天。他们进一步贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在矿与矿，井与井，组与组间展开高产竞赛，广大工人、干部一齐上阵，竞相多采煤炭。全省最大的煤矿——鸡西矿，十一月下旬以来，煤炭平均日产量有了大幅度的增长。
    广大煤炭工业职工最最热烈地响应毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，很快办起了许多毛泽东思想学习班。全省各煤矿已经举办的脱产和半脱产的学习班就有二百余期，参加学习的有一万多人。他们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，以“老三篇”为座右铭，狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义，阶级觉悟大大提高。很多矿工以解放军为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作。双鸭山煤矿的工人到井下生产，都随身带着《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”。他们说：“有了‘老三篇’，力量大无边。”各个煤矿经过斗私批修，大大巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。双鸭山矿务局原局、矿、井、段四级干部已经有百分之九十四站出来，有很多革命干部被吸收到三结合临时权力机构中担任领导工作。在干部中出现了参加劳动多、坚持群众路线多的新气象。一种崭新的干群关系正在建立起来。
