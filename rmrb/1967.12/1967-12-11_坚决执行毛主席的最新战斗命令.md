To forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, to forever be loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to always follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

For Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, we must follow closely, step by step, without deviating even a little. Where Chairman Mao points, we will fight. Like the heroic Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong, "Where Chairman Mao loves, I love; where Chairman Mao supports, I support; where Chairman Mao instructs, I act; where Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance."
