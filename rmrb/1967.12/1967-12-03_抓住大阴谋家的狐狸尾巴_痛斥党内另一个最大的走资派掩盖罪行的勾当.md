Grab the Fox's Tail of the Big Conspirator
—Vigorous Rebuke of the Cover-up Activities of Another Major Capitalist-Roader within the Party

The Revolutionary Rebel Army of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League

Another major capitalist-roader within the party has always colluded with the Chinese Khrushchev. During the period of temporary difficulties in China's national economy, they vigorously advocated "three freedoms and one contract," attempting to dismantle the socialist collective economy and restore capitalism.

In July 1962, another major capitalist-roader within the party, along with the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and Yang Shangkun, attended the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. There, they spoke in code and vigorously promoted the black goods of "contracting production to households." He arrogantly declared, "Agriculture itself, as it stands now, primarily needs to be resolved through production relations." How to resolve it? He shouted, "The masses should adopt whatever form they want, and make illegal things (individual farming) legal." At this meeting, he openly threw out the infamous fallacy: "Regardless of whether the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat."

Under the pretext of "what the masses want," they engage in counter-revolutionary activities, which is a common trick of anti-party conspirators. All representatives of the exploiting classes always pretend to represent the interests of the masses. In reality, the "masses" they represent are just a handful of vampires. Chairman Mao said, "There are people who always stand on the side of the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or rich peasants with capitalist spontaneous tendencies, scheming for a few people, rather than standing on the side of the working class, scheming for the entire country and all the people." The Chinese Khrushchev and another major capitalist-roader within the party are exactly such people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao sharply criticized the evil activities of this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Another major capitalist-roader within the party was frightened and in a hurry, quickly finding his henchmen to discuss countermeasures, attempting to cover up his crimes. He ordered the deletion of his black words advocating individual farming from the meeting minutes and replaced them with the words "strengthening the collective economy." He also explained, "I forgot to emphasize the issue of strengthening the collective economy. ... I am not trying to create a theory to negate the socialist economy ... tell the audience not to misinterpret it." How shameless!

What a "forgot to emphasize strengthening the collective economy"! He said it so casually. That black report from beginning to end was a vicious attack on the Three Red Banners, clearly opposing the collective economy. This reflected his long-standing hostile stance against socialism. How could he use "forgot" to evade responsibility? He shouted that he wanted to "solve it through production relations" and make individual farming legal, wasn't he deliberately trying to spread the wind of individual farming, allowing capitalism to run rampant, and fundamentally undermining the socialist collective economy?

As for "creating" some "theory," this unlearned and incompetent big party boss is incapable of doing so. However, driven by his counter-revolutionary instincts, he will "adapt to circumstances" to concoct various reactionary fallacies and inherit the legacy of all exploiting classes, especially old revisionists. The famous saying "regardless of whether the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat" is a cliché of bourgeois pragmatism, a philosophy of vulgarity like "as long as there is milk, it is a good mother," and completely in line with the old revisionists' cover-ups.

As for saying "tell the audience not to misinterpret it," it is even more shameless! If they convey the beautiful words he changed later, "strengthening the collective economy," that would truly be a misinterpretation. The so-called "do not misinterpret it" is a hint to his henchmen to both spread his black words and not expose his true form. His loyal henchmen immediately understood the master's intentions and promptly revised the meeting minutes.

Soon, his capable subordinate Yang Shangkun meticulously crafted a false report that distorted right and wrong, covered up crimes, and deceived the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In this false report, they praised and beautified another major capitalist-roader within the party, even daringly comparing his black report with the wise instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, saying, "Regarding the issue of strengthening the collective economy and developing production, Comrade ××× clearly elaborated in his speech and later conveyed Chairman's instructions."

What a "Comrade ××× clearly elaborated in his speech"! He clearly opposed Chairman Mao's instructions, spread the wind of individual farming, and desperately undermined the collective economy. However, he said he clearly elaborated on "strengthening the collective economy." This is a blatant lie, truly shameless!

Chairman Mao taught us: "Counter-revolutionaries who appear in disguise give people a false impression while hiding their true nature. However, since they want to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, they cannot completely hide their true nature." No matter how cunning and deceitful this group of counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals are, they cannot escape the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought that sees through everything and is invincible. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, these evil-doers have finally been exposed by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses! We must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and another major capitalist-roader within the party, eliminate their poison, and build our great motherland into an ironclad socialist fortress.

    抓住大阴谋家的狐狸尾巴
    ——痛斥党内另一个最大的走资派掩盖罪行的勾当
    团中央机关革命造反军团
    党内另一个最大的走资派，一贯同中国赫鲁晓夫狼狈为奸。在我国国民经济三年暂时困难时期，他们大肆鼓吹“三自一包”，妄图瓦解社会主义集体经济，复辟资本主义。
    一九六二年七月，党内另一个最大的走资派率领反革命修正主义分子彭真、陆定一、杨尚昆，跑到共青团三届七中全会上大讲黑话，大肆推销“包产到户”的黑货。他气焰嚣张地说：“农业本身，现在看来主要还是从生产关系上解决。”怎么解决呢？他叫嚷：“群众愿意采取哪种形式，就应该采取哪种形式，不合法的（单干）使它合法起来。”就在这个会上，他公开地抛出了臭名昭著的谬论——“不管白猫黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫”。
    打着“群众愿意”的幌子，进行反革命勾当，这是反党阴谋家惯用的伎俩。一切剥削阶级的代表人物，总是装出代表群众利益的样子，实际上他们所代表的“群众”，只是一小撮吸血鬼。毛主席说，有一种人“他们老是站在资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的立场上替较少的人打主意，而没有站在工人阶级的立场上替整个国家和全体人民打主意。”中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派就是这种人。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席对这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的罪恶活动，进行了尖锐的批判。党内另一个最大的走资派心惊肉跳，手忙脚乱，赶快找他的爪牙研究对策，妄图掩盖罪责。他下令把会议记录稿中他鼓吹单干的黑话删掉，换上“巩固集体经济”的词句，并辩解说：“我忘了着重讲巩固集体经济问题，……我不是要创造一种理论，否定社会主义经济……叫听报告的人回去不要传达错了。”真是此地无银三百两！
    好一个“忘了着重讲巩固集体经济”！说得多么轻松。那个黑报告从头到尾都是恶毒攻击三面红旗的，是明明白白地反对集体经济的，这反映了他一贯仇视社会主义的反动立场，怎么能用“忘了”来开脱罪责呢！？他叫嚷要“从生产关系上解决”，要使单干合法化，不就是存心要大刮单干风，让资本主义自由泛滥，从根本上破坏社会主义集体经济吗？
    至于说“创造”什么“理论”，这个不学无术的大党阀倒是无能为力的。不过，他从反革命的本能出发，却会“随机应变”地制造种种反动谬论，也会继承一切剥削阶级特别是老修正主义分子的衣钵。“不管白猫黑猫，只要捉住老鼠就是好猫”这句“名言”，就是资产阶级实用主义者的陈词滥调，就是“有奶便是娘”之类的市侩哲学，和老修正主义分子惯用的遮羞布完全是一路货。
    说什么“叫听报告的人回去不要传达错了”，就更加厚颜无耻了！如果传达他事后更换的“巩固集体经济”的漂亮词句，那才真是传达错了呢。所谓“不要传达错了”，就是暗示他的爪牙，既要把他的黑话传下去，又不要把他的原形露出来。他的忠实爪牙心领神会，立即按照主子的意旨删改了会议记录。
    不久，他的得力干将杨尚昆又下令精心炮制了一个颠倒黑白、掩饰罪责、欺骗党中央和毛主席的假报告。在这个假报告里，他们百般美化、吹捧党内另一个最大的走资派，甚至胆大包天地把他的黑报告和伟大领袖毛主席的英明指示相提并论，说什么“关于巩固集体经济发展生产问题，××同志在讲话中和后来转达的主席的指示中都做了明确的论述”。
    好一个“××同志在讲话中”“做了明确的论述”！他明明是对抗毛主席的指示，大刮单干风，拚命破坏集体经济，却说是对巩固集体经济“做了明确的论述”，这真是弥天大谎，真是太不要脸了！
    毛主席教导我们：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”这一小撮反革命两面派无论多么狡猾隐蔽、诡计多端，也逃不出明察秋毫、战无不胜的毛泽东思想这面照妖宝镜，在这场史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命中，这帮恶贯满盈的家伙，终于被亿万革命群众揪出来了！我们一定要彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派的反革命修正主义路线，肃清其流毒，把伟大的祖国建设成为社会主义的铁打江山。
