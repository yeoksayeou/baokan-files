Once, in a country under the rule of a revisionist leadership clique, African students studying there obtained shiny Mao Chairman badges from Chinese students. They were all so happy that they jumped up and down, and together with the Chinese students, they sang songs praising the great leader Chairman Mao, such as "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman at the Helm." However, when they returned to their school, they were attacked and threatened by revisionists. They fought back against these despicable actions and boldly declared: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the great leader of the world's revolutionary people. No one can deprive us of our right to love Chairman Mao. We will love Chairman Mao, and we will wear Chairman Mao badges!" A Kenyan student wore the Mao Chairman badge on his inner clothing and said, "They won't let me wear it, but I will wear it on my heart. Every day it's as if I see Chairman Mao."

    我们就是热爱毛主席
    一次，在修正主义领导集团统治下的一个国家里学习的非洲留学生，从中国留学生那儿得到了金光闪闪的毛主席像章，一个个都高兴得跳了起来，并且同中国学生一起唱起了歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》。但是，当他们回校以后，却遭到了修正主义分子的围攻和威胁。他们同这些坏家伙的卑劣行径进行了针锋相对的斗争，并且理直气壮地说：“毛泽东同志是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，谁也不能剥夺我们热爱毛主席的权利。我们就是要热爱毛主席，就是要戴毛主席像章！”一位肯尼亚同学把毛主席像章戴在内衣上说：“他们不让我戴，我偏要戴在心上，每天都好象见到毛主席。”
