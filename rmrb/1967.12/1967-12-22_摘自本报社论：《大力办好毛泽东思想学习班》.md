    Chairman Mao's latest instructions must be seriously implemented, ensuring that every point is carried out and every word is followed. Learning and applying knowledge must be combined, with immediate effects. This is a matter of attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought and a fundamental quality that every genuine revolutionary of the proletariat must possess. Learning without applying, talking without acting, is completely wrong.

    毛主席的最新指示，一定要认真执行，做到条条落实，句句照办，学用结合，立竿见影。这是对待毛泽东思想的态度问题，是一个真正的无产阶级革命派必须具备的基本品质。学了不用，说了不做，是完全错误的。摘自本报社论：《大力办好毛泽东思想学习班》
