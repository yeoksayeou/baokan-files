The Indonesian revolutionary people launch armed struggle, opening a new chapter in Indonesian history

Indonesian communists head to the countryside, mobilize peasants to establish rural bases, and launch revolutionary guerrilla warfare, striking fear into the hearts of reactionaries

According to a report from our correspondent at Xinhua News Agency: The Indonesian revolution reached an important new starting point in 1967. This is the beginning of armed struggle by Indonesian communists and revolutionary people in rural areas of several major islands in the country. Guerrilla fighters composed of Indonesian communists and revolutionary people solemnly declare with the sound of revolutionary guns: They are determined to follow the path of the Chinese Revolution pioneered by the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, relying on the peasants to launch armed struggle, establish rural revolutionary bases, and overthrow the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution to achieve revolutionary victory. The rise of armed revolutionary struggle indicates that a new great battle on the path of the Indonesian revolution has begun. The news has invigorated the hearts of the Indonesian people who are under severe white terror, while the reactionaries are trembling with fear.

Chairman Mao said: "In China, without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no revolutionary victory." The same is true in Indonesia. Many experiences and lessons from the history of the Indonesian Communist Party, especially the military coup launched by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique in October 1965, which carried out a nationwide counter-revolutionary massacre and dealt a severe blow to the revolution, all prove this point. Under the severe white terror, Indonesian communists, guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, re-examine the path of the Indonesian revolution. In a short period, they timely summarized the experiences and lessons of the party leading the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle, criticized the right-opportunist errors made by the party leadership in the past, and issued statements from the Central Political Bureau and self-criticisms in August and September 1966. From a series of bloody lessons, the Central Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party drew the following conclusion: "To achieve complete victory, the Indonesian revolution must follow the path of the Chinese Revolution. This means that the Indonesian revolution inevitably must adopt the main form of armed people's struggle against armed counter-revolution, which is essentially an armed peasant land revolution led by the proletariat."

The document of the Central Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party points out the correct direction for the Indonesian revolution, is a call to arms for Indonesian communists and revolutionary people to unite and fight a new battle, and is a thunderous roar across the archipelago, tolling the death knell for the Suharto-Nasution fascist military dictatorship, bringing light to the Indonesian people who are in deep darkness, and greatly encouraging the people of the entire nation. Under the guidance of the Political Bureau's document, the party began a major transformation, shifting from cities to the countryside and from peaceful struggle to armed struggle, and quickly led the people to launch new battles. Jakarta reactionary newspapers cried out in alarm: The Indonesian Communist Party has launched a movement to leave the cities and head to the countryside, and communists and revolutionary people are flocking to the countryside to launch armed land revolution. In a statement in May of this year, the Central Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party announced that Indonesian communists and revolutionary people have "stood up from the ground, once again picked up and raised high the red flag of Marxism-Leninism, and resolutely advanced towards armed revolution."

1967 is the year when Indonesian communists and revolutionary people began to take up arms and fight against the counter-revolutionary armed forces of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. In this year, they successively in the western part of Borneo Island, the eastern, central, and western parts of Java Island, the southern and northern parts of Sumatra Island, and the southern and northern parts of Sulawesi Island, in some rural, mountainous, and forest areas of these regions, mobilized and relied on the peasants to ignite the torch of armed revolutionary struggle.

According to reports from Jakarta reactionary newspapers, the armed revolutionary struggle launched by Indonesian communists and revolutionary people in West Borneo has already reached a certain scale. In recent months, they have achieved surprising victories and engaged in multiple battles with reactionary troops, and have begun to create revolutionary bases in the mountainous areas of West Borneo. The people's revolutionary armed forces have also set up some training grounds in their operational areas, and guerrilla fighters are intensively practicing their combat skills, preparing for a prolonged struggle.

Jakarta reactionary newspapers reported with extreme fear that the Indonesian communists and revolutionary people who are currently engaged in armed revolutionary struggle attach great importance to studying the works of Chairman Mao and are "formulating their strategies and tactics according to Mao Zedong's teachings." According to reports from Western news agencies, the people's revolutionary armed forces in West Borneo recently used favorable terrain in the mountains near Menggala to concentrate superior forces and attack a company of reactionary troops, defeating the enemy badly. Due to the flexible and mobile strategies and tactics used by the people's armed forces, the reactionary troops sent to conduct counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" operations were everywhere empty-handed and exhausted from running around, while the people's armed forces could often choose favorable opportunities to strike the enemy repeatedly.

Currently, the Indonesian Communist Party is in the process of transforming from cities to the countryside and from peaceful struggle to armed struggle. The armed revolutionary struggle is just beginning. The party and the people still face serious difficulties in the new battle. However, as our great leader Chairman Mao said: "In the course of the revolutionary struggle, there are times when difficulties outweigh favorable conditions, and at such times, difficulties are the principal aspect of the contradiction, while favorable conditions are the secondary aspect. However, through the efforts of revolutionary party members, difficulties can be gradually overcome, and a new favorable situation can be opened up, with the difficult situation giving way to a favorable one." Indonesian communists and revolutionary people are fearless and brave fighters. They are breaking through the severe white terror and fighting bravely. Under the brilliant guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, they will surely overcome all difficulties, after a long and arduous struggle, and achieve a new victorious situation with revolutionary arms.

    革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。					毛泽东
    决心走世界人民伟大领袖毛主席开创的中国革命的道路
    印尼革命人民开展武装斗争揭开印尼历史新篇章
    印尼共产党人奔向农村，发动农民建立农村根据地，展开革命游击战争，使反动派胆战心惊
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：印度尼西亚革命在一九六七年出现了一个重要的新起点，这就是印尼共产党人和革命人民在全国几个主要岛屿的农村地区开始了革命的武装斗争。由印尼共产党人和革命人民组成的游击队战士，用革命的枪声庄严宣告：他们决心走世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席开创的中国革命的道路，依靠农民，开展武装斗争，建立农村革命根据地，以推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，夺取革命的胜利。革命武装斗争的兴起表明：在印尼革命的征途上，一场新的伟大战斗的序幕已经揭开了。消息传出，使处在严重白色恐怖下的印尼全国人民人心振奋，而反动派则胆战心惊。
    毛主席说：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”在印尼也完全是这样。印尼共产党历史上的许多经验教训，特别是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团一九六五年十月发动军事政变，在全国实行反革命大屠杀，革命遭到严重挫折的教训，都说明了这一点。处在严重白色恐怖下的印尼共产党人，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指导下，重新探索印尼革命的道路。他们在很短时期内，及时总结了党领导印尼人民进行革命斗争的经验教训，批判了过去党的领导所犯的右倾机会主义错误，并于一九六六年八月和九月先后发表了党中央政治局的声明和自我批评。积一系列血的教训，印尼共产党中央政治局作出了这样的结论：“印度尼西亚革命要取得完全的胜利，必须走中国革命的道路。这就是说，印度尼西亚革命不可避免地必须采取武装的人民斗争反对武装的反革命这一主要的斗争形式，其实质是无产阶级领导下的武装的农民土地革命。”
    印尼共产党中央政治局的文件，为印尼革命指出了正确的方向，是号召印尼共产党人和革命人民团结起来、进行新的战斗的檄文，文件是响彻千岛之国上空的一声春雷，为苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事独裁政权敲响了丧钟，使处在重重黑暗中的印尼人民看到了光明，给了全国人民以巨大的鼓舞。在政治局文件的指导下，党开始了一个重大转变，即从城市转入农村、从和平斗争转入武装斗争的转变，并迅速领导人民展开了新的战斗。雅加达反动报纸惊呼：印尼共产党开展了一个离开城市、走向农村的运动，共产党人和革命人民纷纷奔向农村，发动武装的土地革命。印尼共产党中央政治局今年五月在一个文告中宣布，印尼共产党人和革命人民已“从地上爬了起来，重新拿起和高高举起马克思列宁主义的红旗，下定决心向着武装革命前进。”
    一九六七年，是印尼共产党人和革命人民开始拿起武器，同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的反革命武装展开斗争的一年。在这一年里，他们先后在加里曼丹岛的西部，爪哇岛的东部、中部和西部，苏门答腊岛的南部和北部，苏拉威西岛的南部和北部，在这些地区的一些农村、山区和森林地带，发动和依靠农民，点燃了革命武装斗争的火炬。
    据雅加达反动报纸传出的消息，印尼共产党人和革命人民在西加里曼丹展开的革命武装斗争，已经具有一定的规模。几个月来，他们出奇制胜，和反动军队进行了多次战斗，并已开始在西加里曼丹的山区里创建革命根据地。人民革命武装还在自己活动的区域里，设立了一些练兵场，游击队战士紧张练习杀敌本领，准备坚持长期战斗。
    雅加达反动报纸带着极端恐惧的心情报道说，正在进行革命武装斗争的印尼共产党人和革命人民非常重视学习毛主席著作，并且“按照毛泽东的学说”制订自己的战略和战术。另据西方通讯社报道，西加里曼丹人民革命武装最近曾在孟加影附近的山区里利用有利地形，集中优势兵力，围攻一个连的反动军队，打得敌人狼狈不堪。由于人民武装运用了灵活机动的战略战术，使前往进行反革命“围剿”的反动军队到处扑空，疲于奔命，而人民武装则能经常选择有利战机，不断给敌人以打击。
    目前，印尼共产党正处在从城市转入农村、从和平斗争转入武装斗争的转变过程中，革命的武装斗争还只是开始。党和人民在新的战斗中，还面临着严重的困难。但是，正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所说：“革命斗争中的某些时候，困难条件超过顺利条件，在这种时候，困难是矛盾的主要方面，顺利是其次要方面。然而由于革命党人的努力，能够逐步地克服困难，开展顺利的新局面，困难的局面让位于顺利的局面。”印尼共产党人和革命人民是大无畏的英勇战士，他们正在冲破严重的白色恐怖，勇敢战斗。在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，他们一定能够排除万难，经过长期的艰苦的斗争，用革命的武装打出一个胜利的新局面。
