	Inspired by the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania concerning the Fourth Five-Year Plan, Albanian geologists have recently discovered a new copper mine in the district of Mirdita. This is the fifth copper mine discovered in Albania since liberation.

	Construction of the new mine is now proceeding at an accelerated pace and it will be put into production next year.

	Albanian geologists, in order to guarantee the needs of the smelting plants and copper ore dressing plants, are continuing their geological prospecting work with revolutionary enthusiasm.

	Due to the discovery of new mines and their successive exploitation in each Five-Year Plan period, the output of copper ore and crude copper in Albania has increased rapidly. In 1965, the output of copper ore was nine times that of 1955 and approximately three times that of 1960. This year, the output of copper ore is expected to greatly exceed that of 1965.

	According to reports, the output of the entire copper industry in the Fourth Five-Year Plan period will increase by 297 percent compared to the Third Five-Year Plan period.

    在劳动党第五届代表大会决议的鼓舞下
    阿尔巴尼亚在米尔迪塔地区发现新铜矿
    新华社讯　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚地质工作者在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五届代表大会关于第四个五年计划的决议的鼓舞下，最近在米尔迪塔地区发现一个新铜矿。这是阿尔巴尼亚解放后发现的第五个铜矿。
    现在，这个新矿的建设工程正在加紧进行，将在明年投入生产。
    阿尔巴尼亚地质工作者为了保证熔炼厂和铜矿选矿厂的原料需要，目前正以冲天的革命干劲继续进行地质勘探工作。
    由于在各个五年计划期间不断发现新矿并相继投入了生产，阿尔巴尼亚的铜矿石和粗铜的产量迅速增长。一九六五年铜矿石的开采量为一九五五年的九倍，相当于一九六○年的三倍左右。今年铜矿的开采量预计又将大大超过一九六五年。
    据报道，阿尔巴尼亚第四个五年计划期间整个铜工业的产量将比第三个五年计划期间增加百分之二百九十七。
