	Hearts Ever Toward the Red Sun
	Navy activist in studying Chairman Mao's works and combat hero, Mai Xiande

	Who in the world is the most dear? Chairman Mao, our great leader, is the most dear!
	What in the world is the greatest? The great leader Mao's favor is the greatest!
	What in the world is the deepest? The class feelings between revolutionary people and the great leader Mao are the deepest!
	What in the world is the happiest? It is the happiest to grow up in the new era of Mao Zedong Thought! It is the happiest to see the great leader Mao!
	Most beloved Chairman Mao! You are the greatest revolutionary of the proletariat in the world, the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in contemporary times, the greatest genius of contemporary times.

	It is your brilliant thoughts that educate me to establish the idea of "serving the people wholeheartedly." I will give my all for the people.

	It is your brilliant thoughts that educate me to establish the spirit of revolutionary heroism, "as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight on." I will fight the enemy with hatred.

	It is your brilliant thoughts that inspire me to "make up my mind, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to strive for victory." I will resolutely fight against injuries, determined to train my body well, return to the front lines, and be ready at any time to annihilate the invading enemy.

	It is your brilliant thoughts that encourage me to "be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly..." I will not be complacent in the face of honor and will always be a "volunteer for communism."

	It is your great image that brought me back to consciousness from my stupor.

	It is you who gave me a second life, and it is you who nurtured me to grow.

	Beloved Chairman Mao, I miss you so much and long to see you. For many years, I have been hoping to see you one day.

	Last year, you reviewed the Cultural Revolution army eight times. Each time, I sat by the radio, listening to the live broadcast, and accepted your review with the Red Guards, revolutionary teachers, and students.

	Every time I see your great image on the screen, I always feel that it is shown too quickly, and I can never get enough of your great image.

	As soon as I arrived in Beijing, I went to Tiananmen Square to see your giant portrait. I felt as if you were walking from the east end to the west end of the Tiananmen Gate, and from the west end to the east end. I happily accepted your review.

	I ran to the head of the Golden Water Bridge where you and the revolutionary masses sat on the ground. It felt as if you were right in front of me.

	Every morning after arriving in Beijing, I stood by the window, facing Tiananmen Square and Zhongnanhai, looking at the rising sun, and wishing you a long life over and over again.

	I waited and longed! My most beautiful wish came true, and the happiest moment arrived.

	On the evening of December 3, with a heart full of excitement, I gathered with all the representatives attending the Navy's first conference of activists in studying Chairman Mao's works at the Great Hall of the People, waiting for this happiest moment. At 10:15, great leader Mao, you and your close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin walked towards us with smiles on your faces. You were full of vigor and spirit, waving your hands towards us. You shook hands with me, this is the greatest happiness of my life. I applauded enthusiastically and shouted loudly: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Wish Chairman Mao a long life! Ten thousand years!"

	Beloved Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I swear to you:

	I will firmly establish your absolute authority in my mind. I will read your books for a lifetime, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. As long as you give the order, I will dare to brave the knife mountain and fire sea, and I will gladly perish.

	I will firmly establish your absolute authority in my mind. I will strive to study your brilliant works, apply what I learn immediately, and carry out your latest instructions resolutely. I will follow you closely, understand them deeply, link them with reality, and follow them sentence by sentence. I will revolutionize with you for a lifetime, be loyal to you for a lifetime, be loyal to your brilliant thoughts for a lifetime, be loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line for a lifetime, and dedicate my red heart to you. The sea will dry up and the stones will rot, but my heart will never change.

    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！您是世界上最伟大的无产阶级革命家，是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。
    是您的光辉思想，教育我树立“全心全意地为人民服务”的思想，掏尽红心为人民。
    是您的光辉思想，教育我树立“只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去”的革命英雄主义精神，满怀仇恨杀敌人。
    是您的光辉思想，鼓舞我“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，与创伤作坚决斗争，决心锻炼好身体，重返前线，随时准备消灭来犯的敌人。

    是您的伟大形象，使我从昏迷中恢复神志。
    是您给了我第二次生命，是您哺育我成长。
    敬爱的毛主席啊，我非常非常地想念您，非常非常地渴望见到您。多少年来，我一直盼望着能有一天见到您老人家。
    去年，您八次检阅文化革命大军，我每次都坐在收音机旁，收听实况，和红卫兵小将、革命师生一起接受您的检阅。
    每当我在银幕上看到您的伟大形象时，我总觉得放映得太快了，您的伟大形象我永远也看不够。
    刚到北京，我就到天安门前，看了您的巨幅挂像。我好象看到您迈着稳健的步伐，在天安门城楼上，从东端走向西端，又从西端走向东端。我幸福地接受您的检阅。
    我跑到您和革命群众一起席地而坐过的金水桥头，好象您就在我的面前。
    到北京后的每天早晨，我都站在窗前，面对着天安门、中南海方向，望着初升的太阳，一遍又一遍地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！
    我等啊，盼啊！最最美好的愿望实现了，最最幸福的时刻来到了。
    十二月三日晚，我怀着万分激动的心情，和出席海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的全体代表，齐集在人民大会堂，等候着这最幸福的时刻。十点十五分，伟大领袖毛主席啊，您和您的亲密战友林副主席满面笑容地向着我们走来了。您精神焕发，神采奕奕地招着手向我们走来了。您老人家和我握了手，这是我一生中最大最大的幸福。我尽情地鼓掌，放声地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    敬爱的毛主席啊，毛主席！我向您宣誓：
    我要在头脑中大树特树您的绝对权威。一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事。只要您一声令下，刀山火海我敢闯，粉身碎骨我心甘。
    我要在头脑中大树特树您的绝对权威。努力学习您的光辉著作，学了就用，立竿见影。坚决执行您的最新指示，努力紧跟，深刻领会，联系实际，句句照办。一辈子跟您干革命，一辈子忠于您，一辈子忠于您的光辉思想，一辈子忠于您的无产阶级革命路线，一颗红心献给您，海枯石烂永不变。
