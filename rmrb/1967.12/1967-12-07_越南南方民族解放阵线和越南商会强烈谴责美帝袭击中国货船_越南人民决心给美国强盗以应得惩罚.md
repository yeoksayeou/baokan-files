The statement said that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the people of South Vietnam fully support the firm and correct position and attitude expressed in the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on December 2.

The statement said that Vietnamese trade and maritime workers fully support the position expressed in the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on December 3 and the position expressed in the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on December 2.
