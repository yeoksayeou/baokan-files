Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Celebration of the Seventh Anniversary of the Establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in the Capital

The war of resistance against America for national salvation in Vietnam has set a brilliant example for all oppressed peoples worldwide. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support the Vietnamese people in defeating American imperialism.

The revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union, in collusion with American imperialism, is plotting a new "bombing and negotiation" trick, which will not save American imperialism but will only further expose their own traitorous nature.

We firmly support you. Our two countries are neighboring states that depend on each other. Our two peoples are brothers who share joy and sorrow. The brotherly people of South Vietnam and all Vietnamese people can be assured that your struggle is our struggle. Seven hundred million Chinese people are a strong backing for the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is a reliable rear base. In the face of the strong fighting unity of our two peoples, any military adventure or political deception by American imperialism is doomed to fail.

Comrade Nguyen Van Hieu, Head of the Delegation,
Comrade Nguyen Thuan Luong, Head of the Delegation of the People of South Vietnam,
Comrade Vu Minh Chuan, Ambassador,
Comrades, Friends, Red Guards:

Today, the people of our capital are very happy to gather here to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and to warmly welcome the heroic delegation from the people of South Vietnam on the front lines of the war of resistance against America. On behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, and the Chinese government, I extend our warmest and most sincere congratulations to the heroic people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

The establishment of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam marked the beginning of a new stage in the struggle of the people of South Vietnam against American imperialism and its lackeys. The facts of the past seven years have shown that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the great banner of the people of South Vietnam in their struggle for complete liberation and is the sole true representative of the people of South Vietnam.

After the signing of the Geneva Agreement in 1954, American imperialism immediately began to sabotage it and supported and directed the puppet regime in South Vietnam to impose brutal fascist rule on the people of South Vietnam. Seven years ago, in the face of the aggression and suppression of American imperialism and its lackeys, the people of South Vietnam could no longer endure it and took up arms to engage in armed struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys. In the fire of the anti-American struggle, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam was born in glory.

Over the past seven years, the heroic people of South Vietnam, under the strong leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, have held high the great banner of resistance against America for national salvation, fully demonstrated the invincible power of people's war, shattered American imperialism's so-called "special war," and successfully resisted American imperialism's direct armed invasion. They have defeated the enemy's repeated escalations of the war, causing a fundamental change in the situation in South Vietnam.

In the fierce war over the past seven years, fourteen million people of South Vietnam have been widely mobilized, forming an iron wall of resistance against America for national salvation. The people's armed forces in South Vietnam have continued to grow and have become an invincible mighty force. Now, four-fifths of the land and two-thirds of the population in South Vietnam have been liberated. Many scattered liberated areas have been connected into a solid base for people's war and a vast sea surrounding the enemy.

The Vietnamese people are heroic and fearless, and they do not put the world's number one imperialist in their eyes. Fourteen million people of South Vietnam, on seventeen million square kilometers of land, have fought against more than one hundred thousand American and puppet troops and have defeated them. This is a miracle in the history of national liberation wars.

Currently, the situation of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation is getting better and better. After defeating American imperialism's two "dry season offensives" and annihilating a large number of American invaders, the people of South Vietnam launched a powerful offensive against the enemy in the rainy season this year. In just October and November of this year, they annihilated more than forty thousand enemy troops, achieving unprecedented great victories. Now, the people of South Vietnam have firmly grasped the initiative on the battlefield, forcing more than one hundred thousand American and puppet troops into a very difficult and passive situation.

While fully supporting the people of South Vietnam, the people of North Vietnam are also engaged in intense battles. They are fighting with high morale and growing stronger with each battle, achieving the glorious feat of shooting down more than two thousand six hundred American aggressor planes in the past three years, dealing a heavy blow to American imperialism's policy of war blackmail against North Vietnam.

The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation has proven to the world that no matter how large or small a country is, as long as it dares to fight and is good at fighting, fully mobilizes the people, relies on the people, implements universal military service, wages people's war, and persists in a prolonged struggle, any powerful aggressor can be defeated. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation has set a brilliant example for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations for liberation worldwide.

The victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation has disrupted American imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy and strongly supported the liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. The Vietnamese people play a crucial role in the current struggle between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary forces in the world and have made a great contribution to the world revolutionary cause.

Currently, American imperialism, in a desperate situation, is trying to find a way out by expanding the war. On the one hand, the United States is increasing troops in South Vietnam, stepping up the recruitment of cannon fodder from its vassal states, and intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam. On the other hand, it is using its Thai and South Vietnamese lackeys to repeatedly invade the border of Cambodia and bomb the central and southern regions of Laos. The United States has openly threatened to carry out "destructive bombing" of North Vietnam, to directly land troops in North Vietnam, and even to invade Laos and Cambodia, blockade Cambodian ports, and even boast of "pursuing them into Chinese territory." American imperialism's arrogant posture does not indicate its strength but, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, "The more rampant the internal and external dark forces are, the more they cause national disasters; but this rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength but also shows that they are in their final struggle, indicating that the people are gradually approaching victory."

In the process of American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union has been actively serving American imperialism. Every time American imperialism has plotted a negotiation trick in Vietnam, it has had the support and collaboration of the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union. It is a broker selling American imperialism's negotiation tricks and a accomplice helping American imperialism with war blackmail, a traitor betraying the Vietnamese people's cause of resistance against America for national salvation. The more difficult American imperialism's situation in Vietnam becomes, the more eagerly the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union helps the United States find a way out. Around the October Revolution holiday this year, the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union colluded with American imperialism to plot a "bombing to force negotiation" trick. Recently, the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union has been actively collaborating with American imperialism to plot a new "bombing and negotiation" trick. However, the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union's betrayal will not save American imperialism but will only further expose their own traitorous nature.

Currently, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation has reached a critical moment. The road to final victory has been laid out before the Vietnamese people. The closer they get to victory, the more difficulties they will face. However, no matter how many difficulties and obstacles the Vietnamese people encounter on their way forward, they can all be overcome. The great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, said: "Our people's war of resistance against America for national salvation will still face many difficulties, but our people will definitely defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, liberate the South, defend the North, and eventually achieve the peaceful reunification of the country." The political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam also points out: "As long as American imperialism has not stopped its war of aggression and has not withdrawn all American troops and all vassal troops from our country, allowing the people of South Vietnam to settle their internal affairs without foreign interference, we will continue to fight to the end."

This is the unyielding determination of the three hundred million Vietnamese people. There is no doubt that the heroic Vietnamese people, as long as they are closely united, with one heart and one mind, persist in people's war and the policy of prolonged struggle, will definitely be able to drive the American aggressors out of their country and achieve complete victory in the war of resistance against America for national salvation.

Comrades, Friends:

The revolutionary situation in our great motherland is also very good. Over the past year and a half, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories. The masses of the people have never been as widely and deeply mobilized as in this movement. They have launched a great exposure, criticism, and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; in the struggle, they have studied Chairman Mao's works actively and thoroughly, and their spiritual outlook has undergone a tremendous change. Currently, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the people of the whole country are setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, taking "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key link, further deepening the revolutionary criticism, promoting, developing, and consolidating revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, striving to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, and promoting production, work, and preparedness for war, striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country not only opens up a bright path to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry the socialist revolution to the end but also makes our country a more powerful base for supporting the world revolution. The Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have further enhanced their sense of internationalism and will certainly more powerfully support the Vietnamese people's great war of resistance against America for national salvation, support the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat and the peoples of all countries, and support the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples worldwide, making their due contributions to the revolutionary cause of all peoples worldwide.

The peoples of China and Vietnam are true comrades-in-arms and brothers. Our friendship and unity have been developed in the long-term anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle and have been tested. In the current war of resistance against America, the Vietnamese people are at the forefront of the struggle, making great contributions to our common cause. Seven hundred million Chinese people are a strong backing for the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is a reliable rear base. No matter how arrogant American imperialism is, it cannot pass through the three hundred million Vietnamese people and it cannot pass through the seven hundred million Chinese people. The peoples of China and Vietnam, in their common struggle, support and cooperate with each other, forming an unbreakable fighting friendship. Over the past seven years, the Chinese people have consistently followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people. In the future, no matter what difficulties and obstacles or storms we encounter on the road ahead, the seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will unshakably stand with the brotherly Vietnamese people to contribute all our strength to defeating the evil American imperialism.

Let us raise our voices together:

Long live the great victory of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America for national salvation!

Long live the fighting friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam!

Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the great leader of the Vietnamese people!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

　　毛泽东
　　亲爱的阮文广团长，
　　亲爱的越南南方人民代表团阮春龙团长，
　　亲爱的吴明鸾大使，
　　亲爱的同志们，朋友们，红卫兵小将们：
    今天，我们首都人民非常高兴在这里集会，热烈庆祝越南南方民族解放阵线成立七周年，热烈欢迎来自抗美战争最前线的英雄的越南南方人民的代表团。我谨代表我们的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表中国共产党、中国人民和中国政府，向英雄的越南南方人民，向越南南方民族解放阵线，表示最热烈、最衷心的祝贺。
    越南南方民族解放阵线的成立，标志着越南南方人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进入了一个新的阶段。七年来的事实表明，越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民争取彻底解放的伟大旗手，是越南南方人民的唯一真正代表。
    一九五四年日内瓦协议签订后，美帝国主义就加以破坏，并支持和指使南越傀儡集团，对越南南方人民实行野蛮的法西斯统治。七年前，越南南方人民在美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略和镇压面前，忍无可忍，拿起武器，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行了针锋相对的武装斗争。在反美斗争的烈火中，越南南方民族解放阵线光荣地诞生了。
    七年来，英雄的越南南方人民在越南南方民族解放阵线的坚强领导下，高举抗美救国的伟大旗帜，发挥了人民战争的无比威力，粉碎了美帝国主义的所谓“特种战争”，胜利地抗击了美帝国主义的直接武装侵略，打败了敌人一次又一次的战争升级，使越南南方的局势发生了根本的变化。
    在七年来激烈的战争过程中，一千四百万越南南方人民广泛地动员起来了，他们形成了一道抗美救国的铜墙铁壁。越南南方的人民武装，不断发展壮大，已经成了一支不可战胜的雄伟力量。现在，整个越南南方五分之四的土地和三分之二的人口已经获得解放。许多分散的解放区已经连成一片，成为人民战争的巩固基地和包围敌人的汪洋大海。
    越南人民是顶天立地的英雄，他们根本不把世界上头号帝国主义放在眼里。一千四百万越南南方人民，在十七万平方公里的土地上，抗击着一百多万美伪军，并且把他们打得落花流水，这是世界民族解放战争史上的奇迹。
    当前，越南人民抗美救国战争的形势愈来愈好。越南南方人民打败了美帝国主义两次“旱季攻势”，歼灭了美国侵略军大量有生力量以后，又在今年雨季向敌人开展了强大的攻势。仅在今年十月和十一月两个月中，就歼灭敌人四万多人，取得了空前巨大的胜利。现在，越南南方人民已经牢牢地掌握了战场上的主动权，迫使一百多万美伪军处于非常困难和被动的境地。
    越南北方人民在全力支援南方人民的同时，也正在投入紧张的战斗。他们斗志昂扬，愈战愈强，三年来，取得了击落美国强盗飞机两千六百多架的辉煌战果，沉重地打击了美帝国主义对越南北方的战争讹诈政策。
    越南人民的抗美救国战争，向全世界证明，国家不论大小，只要敢于斗争，善于斗争，充分动员人民，依靠人民，实行全民皆兵，进行人民战争，坚持长期抗战，任何强大的侵略者，都是可以打败的。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    越南人民抗美救国战争的胜利，打乱了美帝国主义的反革命全球战略的部署，有力地支援了亚非拉各国人民的解放斗争和世界各国人民的革命斗争。越南人民在当代世界革命力量和反革命力量的搏斗中起着关键性的作用，为世界革命事业作出了伟大的贡献。
    目前，走投无路的美帝国主义妄图从扩大战争中寻找出路。美国一面向南越增兵，加紧向仆从国家收罗炮灰，加强对越南北方的轰炸；另一方面，利用他的泰国和南越走狗，不断侵犯柬埔寨的边境，轰炸老挝中下寮地区。美国公然发出叫嚣，要对越南北方进行“摧毁性的轰炸”，要直接派兵在越南北方登陆，还叫嚷直接出兵老挝，进犯柬埔寨，封锁柬埔寨港口，甚至扬言要“穷追到中国境内”。美帝国主义摆出这种气势汹汹的架势，并不表明它的强大，相反，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席早就指出的，“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”
    美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中，除了扩大战争一手外，还有进行和谈骗局的一手。它越是困难，就越要玩弄这种反革命的两手政策。加之，明年美国大选，它必然要在更大的幅度上玩弄反革命的两手政策。最近，约翰逊政府指使和派遣了一些“和谈”老手、国际掮客，四方奔走，到处游说，企图利用新年和春节停火，策划一个新的“停炸”和谈阴谋。与此同时，美帝国主义还企图利用联合国插手越南问题，千方百计地要把越南问题列入安理会的议程。谁都知道，联合国是美国操纵的工具，根本无权过问越南问题。
    在美帝国主义侵略越南战争的过程中，苏修领导集团是积极为美帝国主义效劳的。美帝国主义在越南所策划的每一次和谈阴谋，都有苏修领导集团的配合和支持，它是兜售美帝国主义和谈阴谋的掮客，是帮助美帝国主义进行战争讹诈的帮凶，是出卖越南人民抗美救国事业的叛徒。美帝国主义在越南的处境越困难，苏修领导集团就越加卖力地帮助美国寻找出路。今年十月革命节前后，苏修领导集团和美帝国主义相互勾结，策划了一个“以炸迫和”的阴谋。最近，苏修领导集团又加紧配合美帝国主义，策划新的“停炸诱和”的活动。但是，苏修领导集团的这些叛卖行径，是救不了美帝国主义的命的，相反，只能更加暴露它自己的叛徒面目。
    当前，越南人民的抗美救国战争已经到了一个关键时刻。通往最后胜利的道路，已经展现在越南人民面前。越是接近胜利，困难会越多。但是，不管越南人民在前进的道路上，还会遇到多少困难和障碍，这些都是完全能够克服的。越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席说：“我国全体人民的抗美救国战争还会遇到许多困难，但我国人民必将战胜美国侵略强盗及其走狗，解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国。”越南南方民族解放阵线的政治纲领也指出：“只要美帝国主义还没有停止侵略战争，没有把美国军队和所有仆从军队全部撤离我国，让南方人民在没有外国干涉的情况下，自己解决越南南方的内部事务，我们人民就坚决战斗到彻底胜利。”
    这就是三千一百万越南人民坚强不拔的决心。毫无疑问，英雄的越南人民只要紧密团结，万众一心，坚持人民战争，坚持持久战的方针，就一定能够把美国侵略者全部赶出自己的国土，取得抗美救国战争的彻底胜利。
    同志们，朋友们：
    我们伟大祖国的革命形势也是一片大好。一年半以来，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。全国人民群众从来没有象这次运动发动得这样广泛，这样深入。他们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大揭发、大批判、大斗争；在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，精神面貌发生了翻天覆地的巨大变化。当前，全国人民正在毛主席最新指示的指引下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，更加深入地开展革命的大批判，促进、发展和巩固革命大联合和革命的三结合，努力搞好本单位的斗批改，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而奋斗。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，不仅开辟了一条巩固无产阶级专政，将社会主义革命进行到底的光明大道，而且使我国成为支援世界革命的更加强大的根据地。经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，进一步增强了自己的国际主义责任，一定会更加有力地支援越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争，支援世界无产阶级和各国人民的革命斗争，支援全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放斗争，为全世界人民的革命事业作出自己应有的贡献。
    中越两国人民是真正的战友和兄弟。我们之间的友谊和团结是在长期的反帝革命斗争中发展起来的，是经过考验的。在当前的抗美战争中，越南人民站在斗争的最前线，为我们的共同事业作出了巨大的贡献。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，辽阔的中国领土是越南人民的可靠后方。美帝国主义不管怎样横行霸道，它过不了三千一百万越南人民这一关，它过不了七亿中国人民这一关。中越两国人民在共同的斗争中，相互支援，相互配合，结成了牢不可破的战斗友谊。七年来，中国人民一贯遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决支援越南人民的斗争。今后，不论在前进的道路上会遇到什么样的艰难险阻或惊涛骇浪，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，都将坚定不移地同兄弟的越南人民一道，为打败万恶的美帝国主义贡献出自己的一切力量。
    让我们共同高呼，
    越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争胜利万岁！
    中越两国人民的战斗友谊和团结万岁！
    越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！万岁！万万岁！（附图片）
