	Hearts Turned Towards Mao Zedong
	We Love Chairman Mao Endlessly

	An Albanian student had long yearned for a shiny gold Mao Zedong badge. When Chinese comrades fulfilled his wish, he was extremely excited and requested that the Chinese comrades personally pin this badge on his innermost garment, close to his heart. Then he joyfully said, "I love Chairman Mao endlessly. I keep Chairman Mao's badge close to my heart because Chairman Mao is forever in our hearts."

	We wish Chairman Mao eternal health and longevity!

	The Romanian people greatly cherish the shining red Mao Zedong badges. In Bacău City, a third-grade student asked a Chinese comrade for a Mao Zedong badge. The Chinese comrade asked him who was on the badge, and he immediately shouted, "He is the great Mao Zedong." When the Chinese comrade's car left, he ran after it, shouting, "China! Mao Zedong!" A hotel service worker said, "Wearing Chairman Mao's badge makes me feel the greatest honor because Chairman Mao's badge symbolizes light and hope." An elderly peasant in Galați County said excitedly when he received a Mao Zedong badge, "Wearing this badge means Chairman Mao is by my side. I wish him eternal health and longevity!"

	Firmly Follow Chairman Mao's Instructions

	A social activist from Tsu City, Mie Prefecture, Japan, named Takada, loves the great leader Chairman Mao endlessly. Three years ago, when he visited China, he was fortunate to be received by Chairman Mao and heard his kind instructions. Later, he told everyone that this was an unforgettable great joy in his life. He remembered this happiest moment and Chairman Mao's kind instructions, using them as a great force to inspire himself to dedicate to the Japanese revolution.

	Takada said, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of the whole world. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the revolutionary journey of the oppressed people of the whole world. As long as the Japanese people advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, they will surely defeat American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionism, and their accomplices, the Miyamoto revisionist clique, and achieve thorough liberation."

	Takada, to express his endless love and admiration for Chairman Mao, carefully framed the portrait of Chairman Mao given by the Chinese People's Pictorial and hung it in his room. Every morning when he gets up and every evening when he returns home, he looks up at Chairman Mao. He said, "I examine my work every day. If my activities of the day conform to Chairman Mao's instructions and Mao Zedong Thought, then when I look up at Chairman Mao's kind and smiling face, I feel as if he is encouraging me to continue moving forward; if I have not followed Chairman Mao's instructions well that day, I feel ashamed."

	Keep Chairman Mao's Instructions in Mind

	In a Palestinian village, a farmer named Sharif told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that they love listening to Beijing Radio broadcasting Chairman Mao's quotations. Whenever the farmers hear Chairman Mao's instructions, they clap and cheer, expressing their joy at hearing the truth. A family of farmers has four children, the youngest seven years old and the oldest fifteen. They learned many of Chairman Mao's quotations through listening to the Urdu programs of Beijing Radio. They are determined to remember Chairman Mao's instructions and together wrote a pledge: "We promise to seriously study the works of Chairman Mao Zedong. Chairman Mao Zedong is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people but also the red sun in the hearts of the people of the whole world. Although we are far from him, our hearts are turned towards the great Mao Zedong."

	Pay the Highest Respect to Chairman Mao

	One day, Congolese (Brazzaville) young painter Sombu Vansan brought a portrait of Chairman Mao he had painted to a Chinese comrade. He said, "This is to express my deep respect for Chairman Mao."

	The colored portrait is three feet long and two feet wide, framed. Below the portrait, he neatly wrote in Chinese, "Dear Chairman Mao, the Congolese people love you."

	Sombu is twenty years old and has studied in China. He said, "In Congo, I am far from Chairman Mao. I painted Chairman Mao's portrait, and every day when I look at the portrait, I see Chairman Mao again and can pay the highest respect to Chairman Mao."

	As he spoke, his eyes shone with endless joy, recalling his experiences in China and what he personally saw of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, "I will never forget the great Chinese Cultural Revolution. This great revolution will surely achieve the most glorious victory in human history. It is the torch illuminating the world's forward path. We will follow it forward."

	Sombu requested that the Chinese comrades hand over the portrait of Chairman Mao he painted to the great leader Chairman Mao. He expressed his intention to paint another one to keep by his side. He said, "Why do I miss Chairman Mao so much? Because he is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great navigator."

    红心向着毛泽东
      我们无限热爱毛主席
    阿尔巴尼亚一位学生老早就渴望得到一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章。当中国同志满足了他的愿望时，他非常激动，请求中国同志亲手把这枚像章给他别在最里面的衣服上，别在贴近心窝的地方。然后他兴高采烈地说：“我无限热爱毛主席，我把毛主席像章紧紧地贴在我的心上，因为毛主席永远在我们的心坎上。”
      敬祝毛主席永远健康长寿！
    罗马尼亚人民非常热爱红光闪闪的毛主席像章。在巴克乌市，一个三年级小学生向一位中国同志索取毛主席像章，中国同志问他像章上是谁，他立即大声地回答说：“他是伟大的毛泽东。”当中国同志的汽车离开时，他紧跟在汽车后面边跑边高呼：“中国！毛泽东！”一位旅店服务员说：“我佩戴着毛主席像章，感到无上的光荣，因为毛主席像章象征着光明和希望。”加拉茨州的一位老贫农在得到一枚毛主席像章时兴奋地说：“我戴上这枚像章，就表示毛主席在我身旁，我祝愿他老人家永远健康长寿！”
      坚决照毛主席指示办事
    日本三重县津市的一位社会活动家高田，无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席。他在三年前访问中国时，幸福地受到了毛主席的接见，并且听到了他老人家亲切的教导。后来，他逢人便说，这是他永生难忘的一件大喜事。他把这个最最幸福的时刻和毛主席的亲切教导牢记在心里，作为鼓舞自己为日本革命献身的伟大力量。
    高田说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了全世界被压迫人民的革命航程。日本人民只要沿着毛主席指引的方向前进，就一定能够打败美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联现代修正主义及其帮凶宫本修正主义集团，取得彻底的解放。”
    高田为了表达他对毛主席的无限热爱和无限敬仰，他把中国人民画报社赠送的毛主席像，细心地用镜框镶起来，挂在自己的房间里。每天清晨起来和晚上回家后，他都要仰望毛主席他老人家。他说：“我每天都检查自己的工作。如果我这一天的活动，是符合毛主席的教导，符合毛泽东思想的，那么，当我仰望毛主席的慈祥而微笑的面容时，就感到好象他老人家在鼓励我，要我继续前进；如果这一天，我没有很好地按照毛主席的指示办事，就感到很惭愧。”
      把毛主席的教导牢记心间
    在巴勒斯坦的农村，一位名叫夏里夫的农民对新华社记者说，他们很爱收听北京广播电台播送的毛主席语录。农民们一听到毛主席的教导，总是鼓掌欢呼，表达他们听见真理的喜悦心情。一家农民有四个孩子，小的七岁，大的也才十五岁，他们通过收听北京广播电台乌尔都语节目，学会毛主席的许多语录。他们决心要牢记毛主席的教导，一起写下决心书：“我们保证认真学习毛泽东主席的著作。毛泽东主席不仅是中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳，而且也是全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳。虽然我们离他很远，但我们的心向着伟大的毛泽东。”
      向毛主席致最崇高的敬礼
    一天，刚果（布）青年画家松布·凡桑，拿着他自己画的一幅毛主席像来找中国同志。他说：“这是为了表达我对毛主席的深厚的敬仰的感情。”
    这幅彩色画像长三尺，宽两尺，镶着镜框。画像下面，用中文工工整整地写了一行字：“亲爱的毛主席，刚果人民热爱您。”
    松布今年二十岁，曾到过中国学习。他说：“我在刚果，离毛主席很远。我画了毛主席的像，每天看着画像，就又见到毛主席了，可以向毛主席致最崇高的敬礼。”
    说着，他两眼闪耀着无限喜悦的光芒，回忆起在中国的情景和他亲自看到的中国无产阶级文化大革命的情况。他说：“我永远不能忘记伟大的中国文化大革命，这场大革命一定会获得人类历史上空前的最辉煌的胜利。它是照亮全世界前进道路的火炬，我们要跟随着它前进。”
    松布要求中国同志把他绘制的毛主席像转交伟大的领袖毛主席。他表示还要再画一幅放在自己身旁。他说：“为什么我这样想念毛主席呢？因为他是当代最伟大的马列主义者，是我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手。”
