Our platoon leader, Li Wenzhong, is a communist warrior armed with Mao Zedong Thought. From his brilliant life, we see that Mao Zedong Thought guided every second of his life.

In the morning, as soon as the sun rises from the east, the first thing our platoon leader does is lead us in saluting the great leader Chairman Mao, wishing our red sun Chairman Mao eternal life! This expresses our deep love for Chairman Mao.

Whenever our unit is on a field exercise and arrives at a new location, the first thing the platoon leader does is go door-to-door to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, distributing portraits of Chairman Mao, so that the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought can illuminate the hearts of every poor and lower-middle peasant.

When new comrades join the unit, the first thing the platoon leader does is ask about their study of Chairman Mao’s works, ensuring that new comrades, from their very first step, walk steadfastly on the path guided by Chairman Mao. For comrades who go home on leave or are sent on solo missions, the first thing the platoon leader instructs them to do is to study Chairman Mao’s works. Upon returning to the unit after completing their missions, he listens to their work reports, first inquiring about their study of Chairman Mao’s works.

In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, the first thing he says to revolutionaries is: “We support the left with only one heart, not two.” His first conversation with those who have been deceived is to use Chairman Mao’s teachings to awaken them, helping them quickly return to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

The platoon leader’s “firsts” are many. Whether it’s a thousand firsts or ten thousand firsts, ultimately, it is Mao Zedong Thought that comes first. This is such a brilliant first, and it is a first that is worthy of praise and learning!

With this first, revolutionary warriors have a red heart and bright eyes, and their direction is clear; with this first, revolutionary warriors can follow Chairman Mao step by step; with this first, revolutionary warriors can overcome any great difficulty; with this first, revolutionary warriors can remain steadfast even in the face of life and death.

By learning from Platoon Leader Li, we revolutionary warriors must always put Mao Zedong Thought first.

    处处做到毛泽东思想第一
    “支左爱民模范排”副班长　秦学义
    我们排长李文忠，是毛泽东思想武装起来的共产主义战士。我们从他光辉的一生中，看到的是毛泽东思想统帅了他生命的每一秒钟。
    早上，太阳刚刚从东方升起，排长带领我们做的第一件事，就是向伟大领袖毛主席敬礼，祝愿我们心中的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！表达我们对毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情。
    部队野营每到一地，排长带领我们做的第一件事就是挨门挨户地去向群众宣传毛泽东思想，赠送毛主席像，让毛泽东思想的光辉照亮每一个贫农、下中农的心。
    新战友刚来到部队，排长的第一件事，就是询问他们学习毛主席著作的情况，让新战友从迈出的第一步起，就踏踏实实地走在毛主席指引的大道上。有的同志回家探亲或单独外出执行任务，排长交代的第一件事，就是学习毛主席著作。完成任务回队后，他听取同志们汇报工作，又是首先了解学习毛主席著作的情况。……
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，他对革命派讲的第一句话就是：“我们支左只有一颗心，没有两颗心。”他和受蒙蔽群众的第一次谈话，就是用毛主席的教导，启发他们反戈一击，迅速地回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    排长的第一很多。千第一，万第一，归根结底就是毛泽东思想第一。这是多么光辉的第一，又是多么值得歌颂和学习的第一！
    有了这个第一，革命战士心红眼亮方向明；有了这个第一，革命战士就能步步跟紧毛主席；有了这个第一，革命战士就能天大困难难不倒；有了这个第一，革命战士就能在生死关头志不移。
    学习李排长，我们革命战士就要处处做到毛泽东思想第一。
