Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "cadres and soldiers should participate in study classes" is the greatest trust, greatest encouragement, greatest care, and greatest spur for us revolutionary soldiers. We cannot suppress our excited hearts and shout a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!"

I have studied with cadres in a Mao Zedong Thought study class and personally felt the unparalleled wisdom, greatness, and correctness of Chairman Mao's latest instruction. Cadres and soldiers studying together is a new development of our army's glorious tradition of unity between officers and soldiers, and of unity between superiors and subordinates, in the socialist revolutionary period. It is also a major measure to make our army more proletarian and more revolutionary, and to ensure our army always advances along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to victory. This will elevate the close relationship between officers and soldiers, and between superiors and subordinates, to a new height.

Cadres and soldiers studying Mao Zedong Thought together, sharing thoughts, and fighting against selfishness and revisionism, allows cadres to directly receive supervision and help from soldiers. Soldiers also see more of the cadres' strengths and have a more comprehensive understanding of them. This way, the thoughts and feelings of cadres and soldiers are completely merged, the officer-soldier relationship is closer than brothers, class feelings are deeper than the ocean, and the entire army is united as one. We will then be invincible in the world.

At the beginning of studying with cadres in the study class, I had reservations. I was afraid to share my thoughts in front of cadres, fearing they would catch me off guard, and I dared not speak actively. However, the cadres, in front of us soldiers, exposed their thoughts without hesitation. The cadres' actions deeply educated me, and I quickly overcame my reservations and actively participated in the study. In the study, everyone boldly exposed their selfish thoughts, consciously fought against them, and thoroughly corrected them, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify our thoughts. This way, cadres and soldiers became closer, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates became more harmonious. There was a platoon cadre who previously thought that living in the platoon meant good relations with superiors and subordinates were not a problem, and he relaxed his ideological transformation. As a result, he could not consult with the masses well on matters, often spoke to soldiers in a lecturing tone, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates was somewhat tense. This time, comrades helped him dig out the root of the "self" and touched his soul. He expressed his determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and be a humble student of the soldiers. He actively went deep into the squads, consulted with soldiers on matters, cared for soldiers politically, trusted soldiers in work, and cared for soldiers in life. This was a great education for us soldiers. Through this study, we soldiers also deeply felt that to improve the relationship between superiors and subordinates, we must care for, respect, and cherish cadres in every way. If we find cadres have shortcomings, we should help them warmly. If we ourselves have shortcomings, we should correct them quickly like the cadres. Through studying and fighting against selfishness together, officers and soldiers helping each other, the officer-soldier relationship and the relationship between superiors and subordinates will definitely present a new, vibrant, and close-knit scene.

　　干部战士同学习，官兵关系更亲密

    我们伟大的领袖毛主席关于“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的最新指示，是对我们革命战士最大的信任、最大的鼓舞、最大的爱护、最大的鞭策。我们抑制不住内心激动的心情，千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    我曾经和干部一起在毛泽东思想学习班学习，亲身体会到毛主席这个最新指示的无比英明，无比伟大，无比正确。干部、战士同学习，是我军官兵一致、上下一致的光荣传统在社会主义革命时期的新发展；也是使我军更加无产阶级化、更加革命化，使我军永远沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进的重大措施。这将使我军官兵之间、上下级之间亲密无间的关系发展到一个新的高度。
    干部和战士在一起活学活用毛主席著作，共同亮思想，共同斗私批修，干部能够直接受到战士的监督和帮助；战士也进一步看到了干部的许多长处，更加全面地了解了干部。这样，就使干部和战士的思想感情完全溶化在一起，官兵关系赛过亲兄弟，阶级感情更比海洋深，全军上下团结如一人，我们就能无敌于天下。
    在学习班里同干部一起学习，开始我有顾虑，怕在干部面前亮思想，给抓住辫子，不敢积极发言。但是，干部在我们战士面前，却都毫不犹豫地暴露自己的思想。干部的行动，深深地教育了我，使我很快地消除了顾虑，积极投入到学习中去。在学习中，大家都是大胆亮私、自觉斗私、彻底改正，用毛泽东思想来统一我们的思想。这样，干部和战士越来越亲密，上下级关系越来越融洽。有一位连队干部，过去，总认为自己生活在连队，搞好上下级关系不成为问题，放松了思想改造，以致有事不能很好地跟群众商量，对战士说话常带教训的口气，上下级关系有些紧张。这次学习，同志们帮助他挖出了“私”字的根子，触及了他的灵魂。他表示坚决遵循毛主席的教导，甘当战士的小学生。他主动地深入到班排中去，遇事和战士商量，从政治上关心战士，工作上信任战士，生活上体贴战士。这对我们战士是一个很大的教育。通过这次学习，我们战士也深深感到要搞好上下级关系，也要处处、事事关心干部，尊重干部，爱护干部。发现干部有缺点，要热情地帮助。我们自己有了缺点，就应该象干部那样迅速改正。干部、战士通过共同学习、共同斗私，互相交心，互相帮助，官兵关系，上下级关系就一定会出现更加朝气蓬勃的亲密无间新的局面。
