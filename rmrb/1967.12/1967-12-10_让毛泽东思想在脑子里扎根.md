Let Mao Zedong Thought Take Root in Our Minds

Li Congquan, a martyr, was my good comrade-in-arms and a good example. He sacrificed his young life to rescue Red Guards and to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. He was truly a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

After joining the army, he learned from Lei Feng's growth process that "Three Articles" are the fundamental principles of our revolution, the soul of life, and the source of strength. He once showed me a single-volume edition of "Three Articles" and said, "We should instill the images of Zhang Side, Bai Qien, and Old Fool into our minds, which can guide us for a lifetime!" He always seized the time to study, during construction breaks, he used a stick to draw on the ground; during rest periods in field marches, he wrote on the sand by the roadside. One night, I returned to the dormitory from midnight duty and saw him lying on the bed, using his fingers to write down Chairman Mao's quotations on the bedsheet.

After the Cultural Revolution began, our comrades in the class used the brilliant ideas of "Three Articles" to fight against selfish thoughts and to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev. At that time, everyone thought he had low cultural level and did not set specific requirements for him. However, he said very seriously, "I have a low cultural level, but the standard for eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, and for transforming the worldview cannot be low! The task of criticizing revisionism cannot be low!"

He studied "Three Articles" and put them into practice immediately, with visible results. This spring, while performing the task of supporting the left, his father fell ill, and the superior allowed him to go home to see him. But he refused to go. Once, when I mentioned this, he immediately interrupted me and recited a quotation from Chairman Mao: "Our army is entirely for the people. It is a people's army, the army of the people. It is an army for the people's interests, the people's cause." He then said, "No matter how big personal matters are, they are small matters; no matter how small collective matters are, they are big matters! Chairman Mao calls on the People's Liberation Army to support the broad leftist masses. I must not leave my post at the critical moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines!"

Li Congquan's life was one of continuous growth by arming his mind with "Three Articles." I must learn from him and let the brilliant ideas of "Three Articles" take root in my mind, blossom in action, and become a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

    让毛泽东思想在脑子里扎根
    李从全烈士生前“一对红”战友　于德祥
    李从全同志是我的好战友，好榜样。他为抢救红卫兵小将，为保卫毛主席的革命路线献出了自己年轻的生命。他不愧为毛主席的好战士。
    入伍后，他从雷锋的成长过程中，认识到“老三篇”是我们革命的根本，生命的灵魂，力量的源泉。他曾拿着“老三篇”单行本对我说：“我们要把张思德、白求恩、老愚公这三个光辉形象装进脑子里，能管一辈子的事啊！”他每天都抓紧时间学，施工休息时，他用木棒在地上划；野营行军小休息，他在路边沙子上写。一天晚上，我半夜下岗回到宿舍，还见他躺在床上用手指头在床单上默写毛主席语录。
    文化大革命开始后，我们班里同志们用“老三篇”的光辉思想，狠斗私心杂念，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，当时，大家以为他文化低，对他没提具体要求。他却非常严肃地说：“我文化低，但破私立公，改造世界观的标准不能低！批判修正主义的任务不能低！”
    他学习“老三篇”，学了就用，立竿见影。今年春天在执行支左任务中，他父亲生病，上级让他回家看看，可他说啥也不走。一次，我刚提到这事，他马上打断我的话，背诵了一条毛主席语录：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”接着说：“个人的事再大也是小事，集体的事再小也是大事啊！毛主席号召解放军支持左派广大群众，我决不能在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战时刻，离开自己的战斗岗位！”
    李从全同志的一生，是用“老三篇”武装头脑不断成长的一生。我一定要象他那样，让“老三篇”的光辉思想在脑子里扎根，在行动上开花结果，当毛主席的好战士。
