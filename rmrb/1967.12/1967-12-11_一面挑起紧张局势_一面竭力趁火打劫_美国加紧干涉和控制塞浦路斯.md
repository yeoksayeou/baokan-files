	While Provoking Tensions, America Seizes the Opportunity to Plunder
	America Intensifies Interference and Control over Cyprus

	According to Xinhua News Agency, the American imperialists have recently used the Greek fascist regime to provoke armed conflicts between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus, taking advantage of the situation to blatantly interfere in Cypriot affairs, aiming to place Cyprus completely under the control of the United Nations forces, which are tools of American aggression.

	The Greek fascist regime, which came to power in April this year with American support through a military coup, has been scheming to annex Cyprus and has been engaged in various underhanded activities for this purpose. On November 15, the commander of the Greek expeditionary forces in Cyprus and the commander of the Greek National Guard, Grivas, under the orders of the Greek Ministry of Defense, mobilized a large number of Greek troops to occupy two Turkish villages in Cyprus, using American-made cannons and machine guns to suppress the Turkish residents, and threatening to take action against other Turkish villages. At the same time, the Turkish authorities also implemented military mobilization, preparing to invade Cyprus.

	Cyprus is a large island in the Mediterranean, originally a British colony, with a very important strategic position. After Britain was forced to grant Cyprus independence in 1960, the American imperialists eagerly intervened in the Cypriot issue. On one hand, they attempted to use the contradictions between the Greek and Turkish residents of Cyprus to control Cyprus, turning it into a base for American aggression towards the Balkans, the Middle East, and North Africa. On the other hand, they used the contradictions between Greece and Turkey over the Cypriot issue to strengthen their control over these two countries.

	After the recent tensions in Cyprus, American imperialists have been seizing the opportunity to plunder. The American leader Johnson sent the former Deputy Secretary of Defense, Vance, as a special envoy to the capitals of Turkey and Greece to engage in conspiratorial activities and peddle the so-called "peace" plan of the United States. According to Western news agencies, the main content of the American plan, in addition to using Turkey's non-invasion of Cyprus as a condition to meet Turkey's demand to withdraw about 10,000 Greek troops from Cyprus and disband the Cypriot National Guard, emphasizes the need to expand the "tasks" and powers of the United Nations forces in Cyprus, increasing the number of troops from the current 4,500 to over 10,000. This is a plan to infringe upon the interests and sovereignty of Cyprus, turning the Republic of Cyprus into a new colony of the United States and Britain, absolutely ruled by the United Nations forces.

	The Cypriot authorities, under strong domestic public opinion, stated that they could not accept the American plan. Despite Vance's "marathon" talks with Cypriot President Makarios from December 1 to 3 for over 30 hours, the talks still ended in failure, and he returned to the United States in disgrace. According to reports, the Cypriot side believed that expanding the powers and strength of the United Nations forces, as well as disbanding the Cypriot National Guard, interfered with Cypriot internal affairs and would turn Cyprus into a permanent protectorate of the United Nations. Cypriot Foreign Minister Spyros Kyprianou clearly stated at a press conference on December 4: "No other country can decide our future."

	The Cypriot issue is the result of long-term aggressive policies by American and British imperialism. During the period of British imperialist rule over Cyprus, they consistently played the "divide and rule" game, inciting conflicts between the Greek and Turkish communities. In 1960, when Britain was forced to agree to Cyprus's independence, it planted the seeds of inter-communal strife through the Zurich-London Agreements imposed on Cyprus. In 1964, the American imperialists used the armed conflicts between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus to manipulate the United Nations to send the so-called United Nations forces to militarily intervene in Cyprus.

	Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: "The hands of American imperialism have reached too far. Every place it invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck. It has already fallen into the encirclement of the people of the whole world." The American imperialists' continued interference in Cyprus will only tighten the noose around their neck.

### 一面挑起紧张局势　一面竭力趁火打劫　美国加紧干涉和控制塞浦路斯

　　一面挑起紧张局势　一面竭力趁火打劫
　　美国加紧干涉和控制塞浦路斯
    据新华社讯　美帝国主义最近利用希腊法西斯政权挑起塞浦路斯希腊族和土耳其族武装冲突，趁火打劫，露骨干涉塞浦路斯事务，企图把塞浦路斯置于美帝侵略工具——联合国部队完全控制之下。
    今年四月底在美帝支持下通过军事政变上台的希腊法西斯政权，处心积虑地要并吞塞浦路斯，并为此多方进行阴谋活动。十一月十五日，希腊驻塞浦路斯远征军司令兼塞浦路斯希腊族国民警卫队司令格里瓦斯，在希腊国防部的指使下，调动大批希腊军队占领了两个土耳其族聚居的塞浦路斯村庄，使用美制大炮和机关枪镇压土耳其族居民，并扬言要对其他土耳其族村庄采取行动。与此同时，土耳其当局也实行军事动员，准备侵入塞浦路斯。
    塞浦路斯是地中海上的一个大岛，原是英国殖民地，战略地位非常重要。一九六○年英国被迫让塞浦路斯独立后，美帝极力插手塞浦路斯问题，它一方面企图利用塞浦路斯希土两族居民的矛盾，控制塞浦路斯，把它作为美国向巴尔干、中东和北非侵略的基地；同时，又利用希腊和土耳其这两个小伙计在塞浦路斯问题上的矛盾，加强对它们的控制。
    在最近塞浦路斯局势紧张以后，美帝国主义更是趁火打劫。美帝头子约翰逊曾派前国防部副部长万斯作为美国总统特使赶往土、希两国首都进行阴谋活动，兜售美国的所谓“和平”方案。据西方通讯社透露，美国方案的主要内容除了以土耳其不入侵塞浦路斯作为交换条件，满足土耳其提出的从塞浦路斯撤出约一万名希腊部队和解散塞浦路斯国民警卫队等要求外，强调要扩大在塞浦路斯的“联合国部队”的“任务”和权力，把美、英帝国主义控制的这支部队从目前的四千五百人增加到一万人以上。这是一个侵犯塞浦路斯的利益和主权，把塞浦路斯共和国变成“联合国部队”绝对统治下的美、英新殖民地的方案。
    塞浦路斯当局迫于国内舆论的强烈反对，表示不能接受美国的方案。尽管万斯从十二月一日到三日同塞浦路斯总统马卡里奥斯进行了三十多个小时“马拉松式”的会谈，但仍以失败告终，灰溜溜地滚回美国。据报道，塞浦路斯方面认为，扩大“联合国部队”的职权和力量，以及解散塞浦路斯国民警卫队等条款，干涉了塞浦路斯内政，将会把塞浦路斯变为联合国的永久托管地。塞浦路斯外交部长斯皮罗斯·基普里亚努四日在记者招待会上明白表示：“没有其他国家能够决定我们的未来”。
    塞浦路斯问题是美、英帝国主义长期侵略政策造成的。英帝国主义统治塞浦路斯时期，一直玩弄“分而治之”的阴谋，挑拨希、土两族冲突。一九六○年英国被迫同意塞浦路斯独立时，又通过强加给塞浦路斯的苏黎世—伦敦协定埋下了两族纷争的火种。一九六四年，美帝利用塞浦路斯希、土两族武装冲突，操纵联合国派出所谓“联合国部队”武装干涉塞浦路斯。
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“美帝国主义的手伸得太长了。它每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。它已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。”美帝目前继续加紧干涉塞浦路斯，套在美帝脖子上的这根绞索，一定会越拉越紧。
