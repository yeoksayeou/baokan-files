Under the radiant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, the PLA's agricultural and sideline production has achieved unprecedented development and bumper harvests. The entire army, engaged in agricultural and sideline production, has not only reaped material harvests but, more importantly, spiritual harvests. Broad masses of soldiers and officers enthusiastically say, "Thousands of harvests, tens of thousands of harvests, the rooting of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds is the greatest harvest."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, and as reported by the PLA Daily, under the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao that the People's Liberation Army should be a great school, and driven by the surging and powerful Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the various units of the People's Liberation Army, taking the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads as the key, while successfully completing the arduous tasks of war preparedness, training, and the "Three Supports, Two Militaries," have grasped the revolution and promoted production. This has led to unprecedented development and bumper harvests in the army's agricultural and sideline production.

This year, the entire army has undertaken projects to block seas, encircle lakes, reclaimed saline-alkali lands, and opened up wastelands to create over a hundred new and expanded farms, increasing cultivated land by over 800,000 mu. The total grain production has increased by 50% compared to the bumper harvest year of 1966. The production of vegetables, meat, and oil has also significantly increased compared to last year. The vast majority of field units have achieved self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables, and many island and border defense units have achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables. The splendid achievements in agricultural and sideline production across the entire army are great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The entire army has taken Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the guiding principle for army building. Broad masses of soldiers and officers have earnestly studied and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great directive, with the greatest enthusiasm, determination, courage, and vigor, striving to turn the army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, broad masses of soldiers and officers have actively engaged in industrial and agricultural production, launching a new high tide of production and construction. A certain unit of the Nanjing troops, with a combat posture, launched a great battle at the western lake, completing a large-scale farm of 136,000 mu in just half a year, half a year ahead of the original plan, turning a thousand-year wasteland into a guaranteed harvest field. A certain unit of the Shenyang troops, in the Panjin Triangle, undertook large-scale sea reclamation to create fields, and after a year of arduous struggle, has basically completed a farm with 80,000 mu of paddy fields, partially putting it into production this year and achieving a bumper harvest. A certain unit of the Beijing troops, with the fastest speed, the least investment, and the best quality, completed a fertilizer factory producing 12,000 tons annually in just five months to serve agricultural production. Broad masses of soldiers and officers enthusiastically say: "Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive has pointed the direction for the army's revolutionary construction and added boundless strength to the army's combined agricultural and industrial efforts. Thousands of harvests, tens of thousands of harvests, the rooting of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds is the greatest harvest."

Whether or not to engage in production and with what attitude to approach it is not just a matter of work and method, but a matter of direction and line. Engaging in production is one of the three major tasks that Chairman Mao has set for our army and has always been an important issue in the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao teaches us: Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders. Over the past year, our army, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has firmly grasped the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads as the key, conducted positive education on the struggle between the two lines in the army, thoroughly criticized the reactionary bourgeois military line of the Chinese Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, who advocated military first and technology first, greatly enhanced the army's class struggle consciousness, and improved the army's political awareness and enthusiasm for production labor. A certain regiment of the Xinjiang troops is a unit with the glorious tradition of large-scale production in Nanluwan. In 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing personally went to this unit to promote the reactionary bourgeois military line, suppressing production with military training. This unit resolutely resisted the black directive of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing and has long insisted on agricultural and sideline production. Especially after implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, production has developed even further, achieving self-sufficiency and surplus in grain, meat, and vegetables, and contributing 300,000 jin of grain to the state in the past two years. The Bai Gezhuang Farm, which has continuously achieved large-scale bumper harvests on the Bohai wasteland for five years, has insisted on using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, continuously fighting against bourgeois military views, and eliminating the influence of the bourgeois military line. After Chairman Mao issued the May 7th Directive, they raised the great red flag of Chairman Mao's military thought even higher and created a new record this year of 950 jin of rice per mu. Over the past year, our army's engagement in agricultural and sideline production has not only achieved material harvests but, more importantly, spiritual harvests.

Broad masses of soldiers and officers have treated production bases as classrooms for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, battlefields for overcoming selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, using the "Three Articles" as sharp weapons for soul transformation and the best treasures for conquering nature, greatly promoting thought revolutionization, and cultivating the spirit of bravery, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous combat. The army's engagement in production has, from the very beginning, been permeated with the struggle between public and private interests. Every victory in production is the result of overcoming selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. A certain unit of the Guangzhou troops, in the process of sea reclamation, organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, serving the people, and all knowledge coming from practice, linking the struggle to conquer nature with the struggle to conquer the "selfishness" in one's mind, and linking it with the Chinese revolution and world revolution. Living in thatched huts, stepping in mud, with a heart for the country, and eyes on the world. They implemented Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, following the reclamation of ten thousand mu of good fields in previous years, and reclaimed another 12,000 mu of land from the sea, turning the vast saline-alkali land known as the "salted vegetable jar" into a stable and high-yielding "granary." After implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, the troops in the Tibet region have firmly established the idea of long-term construction in Tibet and making the border their home, undertaking large-scale land reclamation. In the process of reclamation, soldiers and officers have extensively studied and applied the "Three Articles," overcoming adverse climates, relying on their own hands to reclaim 110,000 mu of land, and increasing this year's grain production by two and a half times compared to last year.

In the current great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the decisive victory of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, all units of the army are determined to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to more consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to unswervingly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, to carry out Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, to forever uphold the glorious tradition of the army being a fighting force, a working force, and a productive force, and to forever advance in the great waves of the three great revolutionary movements.

    在伟大领袖毛主席“五·七”指示的光辉照耀下
    解放军农副业生产空前大发展大丰收
    全军从事农副业生产，不仅在物质上获得丰收，更重要的在精神上获得丰收。广大指战员热情洋溢地说，千丰收，万丰收，毛泽东思想在头脑里扎下了根，是最大的丰收。
    据新华社二十八日讯　据《解放军报》报道，在伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该是一个大学校的伟大号召的鼓舞下，在气势磅礴、汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，人民解放军各部队以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，在胜利完成战备、训练和“三支”“两军”等繁重任务的同时，“抓革命，促生产”，使我军的农副业生产获得了空前的大发展、大丰收。
      今年，全军拦海围湖、改造盐碱、开荒造田，新建和扩建农场一百多个，扩大耕地面积八十余万亩。粮食总产量比丰收的一九六六年增长百分之五十，蔬菜、肉食、食油的产量也比去年有很大的提高，绝大多数野战部队做到了肉、菜全部自给，不少海岛边防部队也做到了蔬菜全部自给。全军农副业生产所取得的辉煌成绩，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    全军各部队把毛主席的“五·七”指示作为部队建设的总纲领。广大指战员认真学习和坚决贯彻毛主席的这一伟大指示，以最大的热情，最大的决心，最大的勇气，最大的干劲，努力把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校。在毛主席的“五·七”指示的指引下，广大指战员积极从事工、农业生产，掀起了一个生产建设的新高潮。南京部队某部，以战斗的姿态大战城西湖，仅用半年时间，建成一个十三万六千亩的大型农场，比原定计划提前一年半完成了任务，使千年荒湖变成旱涝保收的良田。沈阳部队某部在盘锦三角洲大搞拦海造田，经过一年艰苦奋战，已经基本建成一个拥有八万亩水田的农场，今年部分投入生产，获得丰收。北京部队某部以最快的速度，最少的投资，最好的质量，在短短五个月的时间，建成了一座为农业生产服务的年产一万二千吨化肥的工厂。广大指战员热情洋溢地说：“毛主席的‘五·七’指示给军队革命化建设指明了方向，给部队兼农、兼工增添了无穷的力量。千丰收，万丰收，毛泽东思想在头脑里扎下了根，是最大的丰收。”
    搞不搞生产，用什么态度对待生产，不单纯是一个工作和方法的问题，而是一个方向和路线问题。从事生产，是毛主席给我军规定的三大任务之一，又是历来两条路线斗争的一个重要问题。毛主席教导我们：阶级斗争，一抓就灵。一年来，我军紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这个纲，对部队进行两条路线斗争的正面教育，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿的军事第一、技术第一的反动资产阶级军事路线，大大增强了部队的阶级斗争观念，提高了部队从事生产的政治自觉性和生产劳动的积极性。新疆部队某团，是一个有着南泥湾大生产光荣传统的部队。一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿亲自出马，到这个部队推行反动的资产阶级军事路线，用军训压生产。这个部队坚决抵制了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的黑指示，长期坚持农副业生产。特别是贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示以后，生产有了更大的发展，粮、肉、菜做到自给有余，近两年上交国家粮食三百万斤。在渤海荒滩上发扬自力更生精神，连续五年夺得大面积丰收的某部柏各庄农场，坚持以毛泽东思想为武器，不断与资产阶级单纯军事观点作斗争，肃清资产阶级军事路线的影响。毛主席发出“五·七”指示以后，他们更高地举起了毛主席建军思想的伟大红旗，今年又创造了大面积亩产稻谷九百五十斤的新成绩。一年来，我军从事农副业生产，不仅在物质上获得丰收，更重要的在精神上获得丰收。
    广大指战员把生产基地当作活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，破私立公的战场，把“老三篇”作为改造灵魂的锐利武器，征服大自然的最好法宝，大大促进了思想革命化，培养了勇敢战斗、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风。军队搞生产，自始至终贯穿着公与私的斗争，生产上每一个胜利，都是破私立公的结果。广州部队某部在拦海造田中，组织大家反复学习毛主席有关阶级斗争、为人民服务和一切认识来源于实践的教导，干部战士把革大自然的命和革自己头脑里“私”字的命联系起来，和中国革命、世界革命联系起来。身居茅屋，脚踩污泥，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。他们贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示，继前几年围垦万亩良田之后，又拦海造田一万二千亩，把被称为“咸菜缸”的牛田洋大片盐碱地，建成了稳产高产的“米粮仓”。西藏地区部队贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示以后，大立长期建藏、以边疆为家的思想，进行大规模的开荒生产。在开荒过程中，指战员们大学大用“老三篇”，战胜了恶劣气候，依靠自己的双手开荒十一万亩，使今年的粮食生产比去年猛增两倍半。
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得决定性胜利的凯歌声中，全军各部队决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，坚定不移地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示，永远发扬我军既是战斗队，又是工作队，又是生产队的光荣传统，在三大革命运动的大风大浪中永远前进。
