African nationalist organizations warmly hail Chairman Mao's telegram revealing great truths
Mobilizing the masses for people's war can lead to victory
Nepalese friends say the victory of the Vietnamese people proves armed struggle is the only path for the oppressed

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 22nd: The Zimbabwe African National Union and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola in Cairo stated to Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 22nd that Chairman Mao's telegram to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Chairman of the Presidium Nguyen Huu Tho, is full of truth.

	The representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union in Cairo, Mbejorara, said: "In today's world, it is not someone else, but Chairman Mao who has made such a great contribution to the struggle of the oppressed peoples of the world. Chairman Mao's inspiring words in his telegram are all true. When I read the telegram, I immediately thought of Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis on people's war and his brilliant thesis that imperialism is a paper tiger. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people has proven these truths, and the struggle of the oppressed peoples of Zimbabwe and other countries will also prove these truths."

	He emphasized: "From Vietnam, we have seen the profound significance of the power of people's war. We have learned a lot. The great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, has highly evaluated the struggle of the Vietnamese people, indicating that the Vietnamese people are advancing on the correct path. From the people's war in Vietnam, we see a bright future for our struggle. We firmly believe that as long as we mobilize and rely on the masses, the people of Zimbabwe can do what the Vietnamese people have done."

	The representative of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola in Cairo, Fwamini Dekosta, said that Chairman Mao's telegram "reveals this truth: for us who are fighting against imperialism and neo-colonialism, the masses are the foundation of all true revolutions." He said: "The Vietnamese people have correctly applied Mao Zedong Thought, which is why they have achieved brilliant victories against the most powerful imperialist army of our time, the American army." He expressed the determination of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola to take the Vietnamese people as an example and wage a people's war against colonialism and imperialism until final victory.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, December 23rd: The chief representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, David Sibeko, issued a statement in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, on the 23rd, warmly hailing the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, for sending a telegram to the Presidium Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho.

	The statement pointed out that the enthusiastic telegram from the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, with the rare genius of a proletarian revolutionary leader, analyzed the situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and wisely pointed out: "Regardless of the size of the country, as long as the people are fully mobilized and firmly rely on the people to wage a people's war, any powerful enemy can be defeated." In this regard, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of their great leader, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, have waged a war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "set a brilliant example for the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world to achieve liberation."

	Sibeko, in the final part of the statement, shouted, "Long live the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao! Long live the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam!"

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, December 22nd: Nepalese friends warmly hail the telegram from the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, to the Presidium Chairman of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho.

	A student said: "The invincible might of Mao Zedong Thought, like the morning red sun, shines its brilliant light to the world. No force can stop the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. Its brilliant light illuminates the correct path for revolutionaries. We firmly believe that the heroic Vietnamese people will achieve one victory after another on this brilliant path."

	He said: "The revisionist traitors, with the Soviet revisionists at the center, have been plotting various tricks to force the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and surrender to U.S. imperialism. However, the heroic Vietnamese people can distinguish right from wrong. They will not fall into the traps set by those traitors." He shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	Another friend, after reading Chairman Mao's telegram, wrote a letter to the Xinhua News Agency bureau saying: "The victory of the Vietnamese people proves that the decisive factor in war is people, not bombs or weapons. The victory of the Vietnamese revolution also shatters the fallacy of the revisionist traitors, the Soviet modern revisionist leadership, that the decisive force in war is modern weapons. The Soviet revisionists' argument is only used to intimidate people and act as accomplices to imperialism."

	A young man said: "Chairman Mao Zedong said: 'The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history.' Therefore, U.S. imperialism will not only suffer a crushing defeat in Vietnam but also its true face will be exposed."

	He said: "On the other hand, the victory of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam also exposes the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist traitors and points out to the oppressed peoples of the world that armed revolution is the only correct path."

	He shouted: "Long live people's war! Long live the greatest leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao!"

    非洲民族主义组织热烈欢呼毛主席的贺电揭示了伟大的真理
    动员群众进行人民战争就能赢得胜利
    尼泊尔朋友说越南人民的胜利证明武装斗争是被压迫人民唯一道路
    据新华社开罗二十二日电　津巴布韦非洲民族联盟和争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟驻开罗代表二十二日向新华社记者发表谈话指出，毛主席给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团阮友寿主席的贺电，句句是真理。
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟驻开罗代表门贝朔腊说：“当今世界上，不是别人，正是毛主席对全世界被压迫人民的斗争作出了这样巨大的贡献。毛主席在他的振奋人心的贺电中说的话句句是真理。当我在读贺电时，我就立刻想起了毛主席关于人民战争的光辉论断，关于帝国主义是纸老虎的光辉论断。越南人民的英勇斗争证明了这些真理，津巴布韦和其他各国的被压迫人民的斗争也将证明这些真理。”
    他强调说：“我们从越南看到了人民战争的威力的深远意义。我们学到了许多东西。世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席对越南人民的斗争所作的高度评价，说明越南人民正沿着正确的道路前进。我们从越南的人民战争中看到我们斗争的大有希望的前途。我们深信，只要动员和依靠群众，我们津巴布韦的人民就能够做出越南人民所做的事。”
    争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟驻开罗代表弗瓦米尼·德考斯塔说，毛主席的贺电“揭示了这样一个真理：对于我们正在进行反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的人民来说，群众是一切真正革命的基石。”他说：“越南人民正确地运用了毛泽东思想，这就是他们为什么会在反对我们今天最强大的帝国主义军队，即美国的军队方面取得辉煌胜利的原因。”他表示争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟决心以越南人民为榜样，对殖民主义和帝国主义进行人民战争，直到最后胜利。
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆二十三日电　南非泛非主义者大会首席代表戴维·西贝科二十三日在坦桑尼亚首都达累斯萨拉姆发表声明，热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席打给越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿的贺电。
    声明指出，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的热情的贺电，以罕见的无产阶级革命领袖的天才，分析了越南人民抗美救国斗争的形势，并英明指出：“国家不分大小，只要充分动员人民，坚决依靠人民，进行人民战争，任何强大的敌人都是可以打败的。”而在这一方面，越南人民在其伟大领袖胡志明主席的领导下进行的抗美救国战争，已经象毛主席所指出的那样，“为全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的斗争，树立了一个光辉的榜样。”
    西贝科在声明最后高呼“毛主席的光辉思想万岁！越南南方民族解放阵线万岁！”
    据新华社加德满都二十二日电　尼泊尔朋友热烈欢呼世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席给越南南方民族解放阵线主席团主席阮友寿的贺电。
    一个学生说：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想的强大威力，象早晨的红太阳一样，向全世界放射出万丈光芒。任何力量也阻挡不了毛泽东思想的传播。它的灿烂光芒照亮了革命者的正确道路。我们深信，英雄的越南人民将沿着这条光辉的道路取得一个又一个的胜利。”
    他说：“以苏修为中心的修正主义叛徒一直在策划种种阴谋诡计，企图迫使越南人民放下武器，向美帝国主义投降。但是，英雄的越南人民是能够分清是非的。他们决不会陷入那些叛徒们所设置的圈套。”他高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    另一个朋友在读了毛主席的贺电之后写信给新华社分社说：“越南人民的胜利证明，战争的决定因素是人，而不是炸弹或武器。越南人民革命的胜利还粉碎了革命的叛徒、苏联现代修正主义领导集团所谓战争的决定力量是现代化武器的谬论。苏修的这种论调不过是用来吓人和为帝国主义作帮凶而已。”
    一位青年说：“毛泽东主席说过：‘人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。’因此，美帝国主义不但在越南将遭到惨败，而且它的真面目也将被揭露。”
    他说：另一方面，越南南方民族解放阵线的胜利也揭露了苏联现代修正主义的叛徒嘴脸，并向全世界被压迫人民指出：武装革命是唯一正确的道路。
    他高呼：“人民战争万岁！”“世界革命人民最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
