In a banquet held by the China's Friendship Association with the People's Republic of Syria's Omayya Folk Art Troupe on the evening of the 11th, friends from China and Syria reminisced about the friendship between the two peoples and jointly condemned the aggression of the U.S. and Israel against Arab countries.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo attended the banquet. Syrian Ambassador to China, Sadik, was also invited to attend.

Chairman of the China's Friendship Association Chu Tu-nan and the leader of the Omayya Folk Art Troupe, Yusuf Shakira, both spoke at the banquet. Chu Tu-nan praised the contributions made by the Syrian people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel. He pointed out that the Arab people have increasingly recognized that U.S. imperialism is their most vicious enemy, the Soviet revisionist leadership is the biggest accomplice of U.S. imperialism, and the United Nations is a tool of U.S. imperialism and a political bargaining chip for the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Chu Tu-nan said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: 'The oppressed peoples and nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle.' We firmly believe that as long as the Arab people unite closely and persist in long-term struggle, they will surely defeat the U.S.-Israeli aggressors and achieve final victory."

Chu Tu-nan said, "The Chinese people and the Syrian people have deep friendship. The visit of the Omayya Folk Art Troupe to our country will surely further promote the development of friendship between the two peoples."

Leader Shakira said enthusiastically, "We feel fortunate to visit your great country during the high tide of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Your warm reception is a manifestation of friendship towards the Syrian people and the Arab people."

Leader Shakira condemned the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Israel against Arab countries. He said, "The Syrian people have been tested in the struggle against U.S.-Israeli aggression. Our counterattack is not only directed at Israel but also at all the corrupt forces behind it. Our struggle has received the support of the people of the world, especially the Chinese people."

Leader Shakira said, "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, with great determination and confidence, have finally overthrown the mountains of imperialism and feudalism that oppressed them. The Syrian people must also, with unshakable determination and confidence, join the Arab people in overthrowing the two great mountains in front of us—U.S. imperialism and Israel."

Attending the banquet were also Ji Pengfei, Zhou Yiping, and other relevant officials, as well as representatives of the revolutionary proletarian cultural circles in the capital.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, the Omayya Folk Art Troupe of the Syrian Arab Republic, led by the troupe leader and secretary of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and National Guidance, Yusuf Shakira, and deputy leader Muhammad Kamil Qudsi, arrived in Beijing by plane this morning. They were warmly welcomed by representatives of the revolutionary proletarian cultural circles in the capital.

　　对外友协欢宴叙利亚奥玛雅民间艺术团
　　宾主共叙两国人民友谊并谴责美以侵略阿拉伯国家
    新华社十一日讯　在对外友协今晚举行的欢迎阿拉伯叙利亚共和国奥玛雅民间艺术团的宴会上，中叙两国朋友欢叙两国人民的友谊，同声谴责美帝国主义指使以色列对阿拉伯国家进行的侵略。
    人大常委会副委员长郭沫若出席了宴会。阿拉伯叙利亚共和国驻中国大使萨迪克也应邀出席。
    对外友协会长楚图南和奥玛雅民间艺术团团长优素福·沙克拉在宴会上先后讲话。楚图南在讲话中热烈赞扬了叙利亚人民在反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争中所作出的贡献。他指出，阿拉伯人民已经越来越清楚地认清美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民最凶恶的敌人，苏修领导集团是美帝国主义最大的帮凶，联合国是美帝国主义的工具和美苏的政治交易所。
    楚图南说，我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”我们深信，阿拉伯人民紧密团结起来，坚持长期斗争，一定能彻底打败美、以侵略者，取得最后胜利。
    楚图南说，中国人民和叙利亚人民有着深厚的友谊。奥玛雅民间艺术团来我国访问，必将进一步增进两国人民友谊的发展。
    沙克拉团长在讲话中热情地说，我们感到幸福的是，在中国文化大革命的高潮中访问你们伟大的国家。你们对我们热情的接待，是对叙利亚人民、对阿拉伯人民的友谊的表现。
    沙克拉团长谴责美帝国主义、以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略。他说，叙利亚人民在反击美、以侵略的斗争中经受了考验。我们的反击不仅是对准以色列，也是对准它后面的一切腐败势力。我们的斗争得到了全世界人民，首先是中国人民的支持。
    沙克拉团长说，毛主席领导下的中国人民，有极大的斗争决心和信心，终于推翻了压在自己头上的帝国主义和封建主义的大山。叙利亚人民也一定要以坚定不移的决心和信心，和阿拉伯人民一起推翻我们面前的两座大山——美帝国主义和以色列。
    出席宴会的，还有姬鹏飞、周一萍等有关方面负责人和首都文艺界无产阶级革命派代表。
    据新华社十日讯　阿拉伯叙利亚共和国奥玛雅民间艺术团，在团长、文化、游览和国家指导部秘书长优素福·沙克拉，副团长穆罕默德·卡米尔·库德西率领下，今天上午乘飞机到达北京，受到首都文艺界无产阶级革命派代表等的热烈欢迎。
