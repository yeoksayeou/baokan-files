	The hands of the Soviet revisionist traitors are stained with the blood of Indonesian revolutionary people. They have colluded with the American imperialists to support the fascist military clique in suppressing the Indonesian people's revolution.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report: Our correspondent's commentary: The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has been frantically opposing the Indonesian people's revolution, and their crimes are heinous.

	For a long time, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, along with American imperialism and the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique in Indonesia, have formed an anti-revolutionary alliance to suppress the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people. The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique has slaughtered Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people using weapons provided by the Soviet revisionists. Currently, they are using Soviet-provided weapons to suppress the Indonesian people's burgeoning armed revolutionary struggle. Even the aircraft of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique that are hovering over West Kalimantan and other places to suppress the people's armed struggle are Soviet-made! The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is a gang of ruthless murderers with the blood of Indonesian revolutionary people on their hands.

	For a long time, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has, on the one hand, used "peaceful transition," "parliamentary road," and other revisionist goods to poison the Indonesian people and sabotage the Indonesian revolution. On the other hand, under the false pretense of "supporting Indonesian anti-imperialism," they have armed the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique with a large number of weapons and military equipment to suppress the Indonesian revolution. The Soviet revisionists have also trained a large number of military cadres for the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique within the Soviet Union.

	In October 1965, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique launched a counter-revolutionary coup, initiating a counter-revolutionary massacre of Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique and American imperialism openly supported the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique, suppressing the Indonesian revolution, and their savage faces of opposing the Indonesian revolution were further exposed to the world.

	They have tried to put gold on the face of the devil, lavishly praising the butchers Suharto, Nasution, and others who brutally slaughtered Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary fighters, hailing these savage counter-revolutionaries as "revolutionaries" and so-called "revolutionary leaders," and drumming up support for the frenzied counter-revolutionary massacre. In February 1966, when the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique was carrying out large-scale massacres of Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people, the head of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, Brezhnev, delivered a report at the 23rd Congress of the CPSU, shamelessly expressing friendship to these enemies of the Indonesian revolutionary people and boosting the morale of the Soviet revisionists' anti-communist allies in Indonesia.

	Over the past two years, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has invited many military and political leaders of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique, including Foreign Minister Malik, the main department head of the Economic and Finance Department, Buwono, Air Force Commander Nuraddin, and Navy Commander Muryadi, to the Soviet Union for activities. They have held talks to further tighten counter-revolutionary collusion and have repeatedly reached agreements. In the first half of this year, when the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique was frenziedly suppressing the burgeoning armed revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people, the head of the Soviet military representative team in Indonesia, Paronnekov, was active in various parts of Indonesia, and the Soviet military attaché at the Soviet embassy in Indonesia also held "meetings" with representatives of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique.

	To prolong the life of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique and its counter-revolutionary regime and provide convenient conditions for it to suppress the Indonesian people's revolution, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique formally agreed in November 1966 to extend the repayment period for the original $1.2 billion in military debt owed by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique.

	Over the past two years, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has continued to supply military equipment to the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique. According to reports from the Antara News Agency, in December 1966, the Soviet ambassador to Indonesia, representing the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, handed over the "055" military project built by the Soviet revisionists in Surabaya to the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique's navy for use. According to another report, in September of this year, the Soviet revisionists agreed to supply spare parts for military aircraft and ships to the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique. Previously, due to a lack of spare parts, some of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique's aircraft and ships were unable to operate. The Soviet revisionists' agreement to supply spare parts allowed the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique to use these aircraft and warships to suppress the Indonesian Communist Party and revolutionary people who were persevering in their struggle under difficult conditions.

	The Indonesian people are advancing on the road of armed revolution. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's frenzied counter-revolutionary actions can only accelerate their own doom. Their series of blood debts from supporting the Indonesian reactionaries and suppressing the Indonesian revolution will be thoroughly settled.

    苏修叛徒的双手沾满印尼革命人民鲜血
    伙同美帝一起支持法西斯军人集团镇压印尼人民革命
    据新华社讯　本社记者述评：苏联修正主义叛徒集团疯狂反对印度尼西亚人民革命，血债累累。
    长期以来，苏修领导集团和美帝国主义以及印尼的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团一起，建立了镇压印尼共产党和印尼人民的反革命联盟。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团屠杀印尼共产党人和革命人民，用的是苏修提供的武器。目前，他们镇压印尼人民正在兴起的革命武装斗争，用的也是苏修提供的武器，甚至为镇压人民武装斗争而正在西加里曼丹等地上空盘旋的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团的飞机，也是苏联造的！苏修叛徒集团是一批双手沾满印尼革命人民鲜血的穷凶极恶的杀人犯。
    长期以来，苏修叛徒集团一方面用“和平过渡”、“议会道路”等一套修正主义的货色，毒害印尼人民，破坏印尼革命；另一方面，在“支持印尼反帝”的虚假幌子下，用大量武器和军事装备，武装苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团，镇压印尼革命。苏修还在苏联国内为苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团训练了大批军事骨干。
    一九六五年十月，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团发动反革命政变，对印尼共产党人和革命人民展开了反革命大屠杀。苏修叛徒集团和美帝国主义一起，公开支持苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团，镇压印尼革命，其反对印尼革命的凶恶面目进一步大白于天下。
    他们竭力向魔鬼的脸上贴金，对残酷屠杀印尼共产党人和革命志士的刽子手苏哈托、纳苏蒂安等人大肆赞扬，把这些凶恶的反革命吹捧为“革命派”和所谓“革命领导人”，为疯狂的反革命大屠杀擂鼓助威。一九六六年二月，正是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团大规模屠杀印尼共产党人和革命人民的时候，苏修叛徒集团的头目勃列日涅夫在苏共二十三大作报告，放肆地向这些印尼革命人民的死敌表示友好，给苏修在印尼的这些反共同盟军打气。
    两年多来，苏修叛徒集团先后邀请苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团的许多军政首脑人物，包括外交部长马利克、经济和财政部组主要部长布沃诺、空军司令努尔亚丁、海军司令穆尔亚迪等，到苏联活动，就进一步加紧反革命勾结举行了会谈，并一再达成协议。今年上半年，当苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团对正在兴起的印尼人民的革命武装进行疯狂镇压的时候，苏修驻印尼军事代表团团长帕龙涅科夫到印尼各处活动，苏修驻印尼大使馆武官也和苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团的代表举行了“会晤”。
    为了延长苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团及其反革命政权的寿命，为它镇压印尼人民革命提供便利条件，苏修叛徒集团于一九六六年十一月，正式同意苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团延期偿还原来欠下的十二亿美元的巨额军事债务。
    两年多来，苏修叛徒集团继续给苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团供应军事设备。据安塔拉通讯社报道，一九六六年十二月，苏修驻印尼大使代表苏修叛徒集团，将苏修在泗水修建的“○五五”号军事工程，交给苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团的海军使用。另据报道，今年九月，苏修又同意向苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团供应军用飞机和舰艇用的零件。在此以前，由于缺乏零件，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团的一些飞机和舰艇不能动弹。苏修同意供应零件，就使得苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团能够使用这些飞机和军舰，镇压正在艰苦条件下坚持斗争的印尼共产党和革命人民。
    印尼人民正在武装革命的大道上前进。苏修叛徒集团疯狂的反革命行径，只能加速他们自己的灭亡，他们扶植印尼反动派、镇压印尼革命的一连串血债，必将遭到彻底的清算。
