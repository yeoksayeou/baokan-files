	Editor,

	Recently, during the educational revolution, the teachers and students of our school have all resolved that the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our school must not continue. However, in specific work, how should we completely end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our school? We are not very clear in our thoughts. We hope you can invite comrades from the school who have some experience in this regard to explain it.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools must not continue."

	Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of facts have been exposed, showing that under the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, bourgeois intellectuals have long been and are now rampantly dominating our schools. However, how should we specifically view the situation in our primary schools? Initially, we did not understand Chairman Mao's instruction well. We often thought only of the principal and the directors of our school, assuming that if they could be considered bourgeois intellectuals, then our school was dominated by bourgeois intellectuals; if not, then our school was not dominated by bourgeois intellectuals.

	However, as the criticism of the revisionist educational line deepened, we felt that our previous understanding was one-sided. Bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools certainly do so through specific individuals, but more importantly, we should look at who actually holds the leadership of the educational front, and whether the educational system, teaching principles, and teaching content they promote serve proletarian politics or serve the restoration of the bourgeoisie; whether they implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line or the revisionist line of the bourgeoisie. Only by focusing on this central issue can we find the key.

	Our Xiangchanglu Primary School was newly built in 1965. But even in this short period, the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line promoted all sorts of things, such as prioritizing intelligence, using scores as the criteria, prioritizing admission, and conducting surprise exams, etc. During the recent period of resuming classes and making revolution, we analyzed the past language textbooks in a fifth-grade class and found that some of the texts seriously distorted the image of the working people, and some promoted the theory of the extinction of class struggle. Through these facts, we realized: although the party's capitalist-roaders who formulated this revisionist educational line are not in our school, and the bourgeois "authorities" who edited the textbooks are not familiar to us, bourgeois intellectuals, through the revisionist educational system, teaching content, and bourgeois teaching methods, have dominated our school. Therefore, to end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our school, we must, in the teaching practice of resuming classes and making revolution, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, launch an attack on the revisionist educational line, thoroughly eliminate its poison, and let the proletarian educational line completely occupy the school battlefield.

	At present, after exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents on the educational front, specifically in each school, we must ensure that the leadership is in the hands of genuine proletarian revolutionaries, and at the same time, we must build a revolutionary teaching staff. The Party Central Committee points out: "The majority of teachers and cadres in various schools are good or relatively good. Except for landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, some people have made mistakes in the past, but as long as they can recognize their mistakes and correct them, they should be allowed to come out and work." The situation in our school is the same.

	Now there is a view that all the original teachers in the school are bourgeois intellectuals and that they cannot be allowed to teach during the period of resuming classes and making revolution. We believe that this view lacks specific class analysis. Except for landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, for the majority of teachers, the most important thing is to actively participate in resuming classes and making revolution, take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guiding principle, launch a criticism of the revisionist educational line, and at the same time, fiercely fight against selfishness, using the great thought of Mao Zedong to thoroughly transform their bourgeois worldview. In this way, a teaching staff armed with Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary can be established, fundamentally ending the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our school.

### 彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象

　　彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象
　　编辑同志：
    最近，在教育革命中，我们学校的师生，都决心再也不能让资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象存在下去了。但是，在具体工作中，应该怎样彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象呢？我们思想上也不怎么清楚。希望你们约请学校中在这方面有所体会的同志解释一下。　西安一小学革命教师
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，揭发出的大量事实说明，在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，资产阶级知识分子长期地、猖狂地统治着我们的学校。但是，怎样具体地看待我们小学的情况呢？开始，我们对毛主席的这个指示，是很不理解的，常常想到的就是本校的校长和主任，以为如果他们算得上是资产阶级知识分子，我们学校就是资产阶级知识分子统治的学校；如果算不上，那我们学校就没有被资产阶级知识分子统治。
    但是，随着对修正主义教育路线大批判的逐步深入开展，我们觉得先前的理解是片面的。资产阶级知识分子统治我们的学校，固然要通过具体的人，但更重要的是看教育战线的实际领导权到底掌握在谁手里，看他们所推行的教育制度、教学方针、教学内容，是为无产阶级政治服务，还是为资产阶级复辟效劳；执行的是毛主席的革命路线，还是资产阶级修正主义路线。围绕这个中心，才能找到关键之所在。
    我们香厂路小学是一九六五年新建的。但就在这短短的时间里，反革命修正主义教育路线所推行的那套货色，什么智育第一，分数挂帅，升学第一，用突然袭击的方法进行考试，等等，都应有尽有。在最近复课闹革命中，我们五年级一个班，对过去的语文教材进行了分析，发现其中有的课文严重歪曲了劳动人民形象，有的宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”。通过这些事实，我们认识到：虽然制定这条修正主义教育路线的党内走资派不在我们学校，编辑教材的资产阶级“权威”，和我们也不相识，但资产阶级知识分子，却通过修正主义教育制度、教学内容以及资产阶级的教学方法等等，统治了我们的学校。因此，要结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，就要在复课闹革命的教学实践中，高举革命大批判的大旗，向修正主义教育路线开火，彻底肃清它的流毒，让无产阶级教育路线完全占领学校阵地。
    当前，在揪出了党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在教育战线上的代理人之后，具体到各学校，就是要保证领导权掌握在真正的无产阶级革命派手中，同时还必须建立一支革命化的教师队伍。党中央指出：“各学校的教师和干部，大多数是好的或比较好的。除了地、富、反、坏、右分子以外，有些人过去犯了错误，只要他们能够认识错误，改正错误，就应该让他们站出来工作。”我们学校的情况也是如此。
    现在有种说法，认为学校里原有的教师都是资产阶级知识分子，复课闹革命不能让他们上讲台。我们认为这种说法缺乏具体的阶级分析。除了地、富、反、坏、右分子以外，对大多数教师来说，最重要的是要积极投入复课闹革命，以“斗私，批修”为纲，展开对修正主义教育路线的批判，同时要狠斗“私”字，用伟大的毛泽东思想，彻底改造自己的资产阶级世界观。这样，就能建立起一支用毛泽东思想武装的、革命化的教师队伍，从根本上结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象。
