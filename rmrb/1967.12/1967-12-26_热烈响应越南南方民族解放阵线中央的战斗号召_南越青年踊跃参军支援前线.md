The people of various provinces in South Vietnam have enthusiastically responded to the battle call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, eagerly enlisting in the military and providing substantial manpower and material support to the frontline. They are determined to achieve greater victories in the upcoming dry season of winter and spring.

Recently, thousands of young men and women in Thua Thien Province have flocked to enlist in the military and join the youth shock brigades. The people of Phu Vang, Huong Tra, and Phu Vinh districts have mobilized nearly a thousand young men and women who have been living and studying in the enemy-controlled city of Hue for a long time to return to their recently liberated hometowns to participate in the struggle against American imperialism. Among them, more than 200 young people have already enlisted in the military. The ethnic minority youth in the western mountainous region of Thua Thien Province have also enthusiastically responded to the call to enlist, with 150 young people already signing up.

The people of Ninh Thuan and Binh Dinh Provinces have recently been actively serving the frontline. In De Hue District, despite frequent enemy harassment and attacks that have caused significant difficulties for the people, nearly 400 people have joined the civilian labor force to support the frontline in a short period. The people of De Hoa and Cam Duong districts, despite enemy blockades and persecution, have flocked to the liberated areas to serve in the struggle against American imperialism. Many have also requested to enlist in the military.

After studying the winter-spring battle call of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front, the people of An Khe and Chau Duc districts in Ninh Thuan Province have actively launched competitions and exceeded the task of contributing funds to support the frontline. In just the second half of October, more than 100 young people from some communes in these two districts applied to join the civilian labor force to support the frontline.

From late October to early November, thousands of young people in the Southwest region of South Vietnam have enlisted in the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, determined to contribute to the struggle against American imperialism.

In many places in Soc Trang Province, young people have held "Anti-American, Save the Nation" rallies, where they enthusiastically enlisted in the military. In three districts, including Thuong Dinh, nearly 300 young people have already enlisted. On October 27, more than 70 young people from Gia Tan Commune in Thuong Dinh District broke through enemy blockades to reach the liberated area to participate in the "Anti-American, Save the Nation" rally and then enlisted in the military together.

In some communes in Giong Trom and Tra Vinh districts of Kien Giang Province, the people have enthusiastically responded to the battle call of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, personally sending their children to join the revolutionary forces to contribute to the annihilation of the American puppet army and the liberation of the nation. In recent days, 500 young people have enlisted in the military.

In some areas of Dinh Tuong Province, 246 young people joined the liberation army in October and early November. In four communes in Chanh Thien, Thuan An, Hoa Khanh, and Binh An districts of Chau Duc County, 98 young people, inspired by the victory of the battle in Chau Duc on November 10, joined the army the next day. The young men and women who are still at home have also signed up and are ready to depart at any time.

In three communes in Tan Phu District, Tay Ninh Province, 100 young people enthusiastically enlisted in the military over two days, November 7 and 8. At the same time, a youth shock brigade was established in this district, ready to march to the battlefield to serve the battle at any time.
