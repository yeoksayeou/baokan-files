People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam's Binh Duong Province launched a fierce attack on the Long Binh U.S. logistics base early on the morning of December 4, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. This was the second attack on the base by the liberation forces in less than five days.

According to reports from Western news agencies, during the battle on December 4, the liberation forces used small arms to hit the ammunition depot at the eastern end of the base, turning the entire base into a sea of fire. Smoke rose to a height of 1,000 feet. Fifteen hours after the attack, the fire was still burning, destroying a large amount of military supplies, and many American bandits were seriously injured.

Earlier, on December 1, the base also experienced a violent explosion during an attack by the liberation forces, resulting in a fire that burned for five hours in the base's warehouses.

The Long Binh U.S. logistics base is located about 20 kilometers northeast of Saigon and is one of the major ammunition depots of the U.S. invading army in South Vietnam. Since December 28, 1966, it has been repeatedly attacked by the liberation forces. In just four attacks up to February 4, 1967, the liberation forces in Binh Duong Province blew up 48 enemy ammunition depots and 43 military vehicles, killing and wounding nearly 500 U.S. soldiers.

Additionally, it was reported that on the night of December 4, the liberation forces in the Mekong Delta region of My Tho Province attacked the invading forces of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division with recoilless rifles and automatic weapons. After a fierce battle, they killed and wounded 150 American bandits.

    把美军基地变成一片火海  叫美国强盗葬身在人民战争火阵中
    南越解放军五天内两次猛袭龙平美军基地
    新华社五日讯　西贡消息：越南南方边和省人民解放武装力量，四日清晨猛烈袭击龙平美军后勤基地，使敌人遭受惨重损失。这是解放武装力量在不到五天内连续对这个基地发动的第二次袭击。
    据西方通讯社报道，在四日战斗中，人民解放武装力量用小型武器击中了基地东端的军火仓库，使整个基地顿时变成一片火海，浓烟上升高达一千英尺。在袭击后的十五小时，大火仍在燃烧，烧毁了大量军用物资，许多美国强盗受了重伤。
    在此以前，十二月一日，这个基地在人民解放武装力量的袭击下也引起猛烈爆炸，基地的仓库发生了历时五个小时的熊熊烈火。
    龙平美军后勤基地位于西贡东北约二十公里，是美国侵略军在南越的大军火库之一。自一九六六年十二月二十八日以来，多次受到人民解放武装力量的袭击。仅到一九六七年二月四日为止的四次袭击中，边和省人民解放武装力量就炸毁敌人弹药库四十八座，军车四十三辆，打死打伤美军近五百名。
    另据报道，战斗在湄公河三角洲的美萩省人民解放武装力量，四日晚上用无后座力炮和自动武器袭击了美国第九步兵师的侵略军，经过激烈的战斗，共打死打伤美国强盗一百五十名。
