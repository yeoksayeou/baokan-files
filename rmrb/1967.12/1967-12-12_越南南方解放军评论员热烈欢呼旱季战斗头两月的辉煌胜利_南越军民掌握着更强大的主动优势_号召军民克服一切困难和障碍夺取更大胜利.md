Vietnamese Southern Liberation Army commentator recently published an article, warmly celebrating the glorious victories achieved by the Vietnamese Southern military and people in the first two months (October and November) of the third dry season battle, where they annihilated over 40,000 enemy forces. The article calls on the Vietnamese Southern military and people to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, to fiercely and continuously strike the enemy, to push the anti-American national salvation war to a new high, and to seize greater victories.

The article states that the victories achieved by the Vietnamese Southern military and people in the early dry season this year are unprecedentedly great and comprehensive.

The article points out that the Vietnamese Southern military and people currently hold a more powerful initiative on all battlefields compared to any other time. As soon as the dry season began, the Southern Vietnamese military and people took the initiative to launch offensives against the enemy, especially in the Central Highlands, the Southern Eastern Region, and the Mekong Delta, where they inflicted heavy blows on the enemy. At the same time, they also tied down hundreds of thousands of American and puppet troops in Quang Tri, Thua Thien, and the Central Coastal Plain. The article says that in many places, when the People's Liberation Armed Forces fiercely attacked the enemy's military forces, the people also rose up to eliminate the enemy's thugs, destroy the enemy's ruling institutions, seize control, and carry out military supply work. Thus, a comprehensive offensive against the enemy was formed, putting them in a very embarrassing situation.

The article states that the People's Liberation Armed Forces have significantly improved their enemy annihilation numbers and the quality of annihilation battles during this period, eliminating a large number of American troops as well as a large number of puppet troops. Especially in the first ten days of November, they almost annihilated an enemy battalion every day.

The article says that the three types of liberation forces in South Vietnam are becoming stronger and stronger, coordinating more closely, and increasingly skillfully and flexibly using various forms of people's war. They not only can fight continuously in one place but also have raised the level of annihilation battles, annihilating the enemy battalion by battalion. Many places' guerrilla forces and militia also fought excellently against "sweeping operations." They closely coordinated with the main forces, annihilating a large number of enemies.

The article says that the victories achieved by the Vietnamese Southern military and people in the early dry season this year are of great significance. It fully shows that the enemy is being weakened comprehensively. At the same time, it also shows that the Southern Vietnamese military and people hold an even stronger and more consolidated initiative.

The article says that the strength of the Southern Vietnamese military and people is stronger than ever before, and their revolutionary will is even firmer. They will continue to deliver fatal blows to the enemy and will surely achieve a complete victory.

　　越南南方解放军评论员热烈欢呼旱季战斗头两月的辉煌胜利
　　南越军民掌握着更强大的主动优势
　　号召军民克服一切困难和障碍夺取更大胜利
    据新华社河内十日电　越南南方解放军评论员最近发表文章，热烈欢呼越南南方军民在第三个旱季战斗的头两个月（十月和十一月）中取得歼灭敌人四万多名的辉煌胜利。文章号召越南南方军民克服一切困难和障碍，狠狠地连续地打，把抗美救国战争推向新的高潮，夺取更大的胜利。
    文章说，越南南方军民在今年旱季初期取得的胜利，是空前巨大、全面的胜利。
    文章指出，越南南方军民今年在各个战场上占有比过去任何时候都更加强大的主动优势。旱季一开始，南越军民就主动地向敌人发动攻势，特别是在西原地区、南部东区和湄公河三角洲等许多战场上，都给予敌人沉重的打击，同时还在广治、承天和中部中区平原牵制住数以十万计的美伪军。文章说，在许多地方，当人民解放武装力量猛烈打击敌人的军事力量的时候，人民也起来消灭恶棍，捣毁敌人的统治机构，夺取控制权，展开兵运工作。从而形成了对敌人的全面攻势，使它们陷于非常狼狈的困境。
    文章说，人民解放武装力量在这期间的歼敌数量和歼灭战质量有了重大的提高，既消灭了大量美军，也消灭了大量的伪军。特别是在十一月初的十天中，几乎每天都歼灭了敌人一个营的兵力。
    文章说，南越三种解放武装力量越打越强，配合得更加紧密，日益熟练和灵活地运用人民战争的各种作战形式。他们不仅能够在一个地方连续作战，而且打歼灭战的水平有了新的提高，一营又一营地歼灭敌人。许多地方的游击队和民兵的反“扫荡”也打得很出色。他们同主力部队紧密配合，消灭了大量敌人。
    文章说，越南南方军民在今年旱季初期取得的胜利具有十分重大的意义。它充分表明敌人正在遭到全面的削弱。同时也表明南越军民掌握着更加强大和巩固的主动优势。
    文章说，南越军民的力量比过去任何时候都更强大，革命意志更加坚强。他们将继续给予敌人以致命的打击并且必将取得彻底的胜利。
