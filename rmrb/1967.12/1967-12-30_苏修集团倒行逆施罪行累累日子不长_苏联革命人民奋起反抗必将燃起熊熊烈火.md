The imperialists of the United States and all other harmful elements have already prepared their own gravediggers. The day of their burial will not be long in coming.			Mao Zedong

The Soviet revisionist clique's heinous crimes will not last long.

The revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will rise up and ignite a blazing fire.

According to a report from our correspondent at Xinhua News Agency on the 29th: Chairman Mao, the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, pointed out in 1962: "The Soviet Union is the first socialist country, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and the state in the Soviet Union has been usurped by revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the broad masses of the Soviet people, the broad ranks of party members and cadres, are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long." Today, history is developing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao in the Soviet Union.

In recent years, the Soviet revisionist leadership has been increasingly pushing the revisionist line, restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, and, internationally, colluding with the imperialists led by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries to maintain the old order of capitalism and colonialism. The broad revolutionary people of the Soviet Union are increasingly recognizing the traitorous faces of the Brezhnev, Kosygin clique. Their dissatisfaction, condemnation, and struggle against the Soviet revisionist leadership are intensifying and will eventually form a blazing revolutionary fire, completely destroying the reactionary rule of the new tsars in the Kremlin.

		Angrily Denounce the Soviet Revisionists' Crime of Restoring Capitalism

After seizing the party and state power, the Soviet revisionist leadership has been restoring capitalism throughout the Soviet Union. Under the banner of the "people's state," they have turned the great socialist state created by Lenin into a capitalist state, imposing bourgeois fascist dictatorship on the broad masses of Soviet laborers. Under the guise of the "people's party," they have turned the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into a bourgeois party. Under the cover of "economic reform," they have transformed the socialist economy of the Soviet Union into a capitalist economy. Under the banner of "people's culture," they have allowed bourgeois ideology to dominate the ideological and cultural realm of the Soviet Union. This small clique of traitors and scabs has reduced the thriving Soviet state of the Lenin and Stalin era to this state, yet shamelessly portray themselves as "Marxist-Leninists" and flag-bearers of communist construction, deceiving the Soviet people and the people of the world. However, the Soviet people are increasingly seeing through their traitorous faces and recognizing their betrayal of the great cause of Lenin, trampling on the banner of socialism and communism, and the crime of restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union.

Many Soviet workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, and cadres angrily point out that the Soviet revisionist leadership, from Khrushchev to the Brezhnev, Kosygin clique, are not "Marxist-Leninists" at all, but a bunch of thoroughgoing revisionists and new bourgeoisie. Their "communist construction" is false, and the restoration of capitalism is true. A few months ago, a Soviet soldier bluntly exposed the false faces of these revisionist traitors to Chinese comrades. He said: "The Brezhnev, Kosygin clique are faithful executors of Khrushchev's revisionist line. They hang the banner of Marxism-Leninism but do capitalist deeds. They are thoroughgoing capitalists." A cadre working in a certain department of the Soviet Union said, "The Soviet revisionist leadership is 'fake Leninists, real new bourgeoisie. They have betrayed Marxism-Leninism and are pushing capitalism in the Soviet Union.'" An old worker in the capital city of Riga, Latvia, pointed out bluntly, "Since the Khrushchev clique usurped the party and state power of the Soviet Union, the Soviet regime has actually ceased to exist." A Soviet journalist pointed out that the "communist construction" boasted by the Soviet revisionist leadership is completely false. He said, "Now, 'the Soviet Union has no socialism at all.'"

Many laborers and revolutionary intellectuals universally pointed out in their conversations that in today's Soviet Union, there is no democracy and freedom for the laboring people. The laboring people are completely under the oppression and slavery of the bourgeois privileged class represented by the Soviet revisionist leadership. An old worker said, "During Stalin's time, no one dared to bully workers, but now, workers are oppressed everywhere." A construction worker told Chinese comrades, "Now, there are informers everywhere in the Soviet Union, and the laboring people have no freedom of speech."

Many people in their conversations strongly denounced the situation where prices are constantly rising, class differentiation is becoming more pronounced, and the broad masses of laborers are economically exploited under the rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership. They exposed that in the Soviet Union where capitalism has been restored, "a few people are getting richer and richer, and the majority are getting poorer and poorer." The Soviet revisionist leadership implements the "new system" to further strengthen the exploitation of the laboring people. A Soviet teacher said, "The Soviet revisionist leadership is completely restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union. In the factories and offices of the Soviet Union, a small clique of privileged class members do not work but have a lot of income, and ordinary staff are exploited by them." A disabled soldier who participated in the defense of Stalingrad said, "I lost both legs in the defense of Stalingrad, but now I am bullied by them (the Soviet revisionist leadership), and my life is hard." A truck driver said that he now has very little income, "I can't even buy a piece of meat, and it takes two months' salary to buy a sweater." He said, "Now, the life of the laboring people in the Soviet Union is much worse than when Stalin was alive."

		Firmly Oppose the Soviet Revisionists' Collusion with the United States to Oppose China

In foreign policy, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique shamelessly betrayed proletarian internationalism and consistently pursued the capitulationist line of "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful competition," and "peaceful transition," colluding with U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries to vigorously sabotage and suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, and madly oppose the stronghold of world revolution—China. Their heinous crimes have been increasingly strongly condemned and opposed by the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union.

Many Soviet friends firmly told Chinese comrades: The Soviet people firmly oppose the counter-revolutionary revisionist foreign policy pursued by the Soviet revisionist clique. An old man in Riga angrily said, "The Soviet revisionist clique is 'carrying out the will of the United States.'" A young student in Moscow pointed out, "Now, the leaders of the Soviet Union have colluded with U.S. imperialism." An old worker who participated in the defense of the motherland, in exposing the collusion between the Soviet revisionist leadership and U.S. imperialism, said very angrily, "Now, the devils of the West have all become guests of the Kremlin!"

The laboring people of the Soviet Union strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's crime of colluding with U.S. imperialism to sabotage the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation. Several Ukrainian workers said, "We firmly oppose imperialist wars of aggression, and we support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and all other just wars." They expressed their firm opposition to the Soviet revisionist leadership's revisionist view of "opposing all wars." The Soviet revisionist leadership's shameful behavior of selling out the interests of the Arab people in the Middle East incident this June also aroused the anger of the broad revolutionary people of the Soviet Union, and they denounced this as "a thoroughly traitorous act."

There is a long and deep friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. The reactionary policy of colluding with the United States to oppose China pursued by the Soviet revisionist leadership has met with the most resolute and strongest opposition and resistance from the broad masses of the Soviet people. Soviet laborers are very friendly and treat Chinese comrades like family when they meet them. Many people, despite the threats and persecution of Soviet secret police and thugs, openly expressed: they firmly oppose the Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China policy, stand firmly on the side of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary era, Chairman Mao, and will forever be friendly with the Chinese people. An old man by the Baltic Sea said, "Mao Zedong is a true Marxist-Leninist." A medical worker in Georgia said, "We support the Marxist-Leninist line pursued by the Communist Party of China." A Soviet worker said, "We Soviet people love the Chinese people the most. Now, the government of the Soviet Union does not represent our people. Let Brezhnev and Kosygin go to hell!" A Soviet officer sincerely told Chinese comrades, "The great friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, forged by Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong, is indestructible." He said, "If anyone dares to invade China, you will see that upright Soviet soldiers will definitely stand with the Chinese people." These conversations of ordinary Soviet people vividly show that the Soviet revisionist clique's anti-China policy is extremely unpopular in the Soviet Union. The great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is something that a small clique of Soviet revisionist traitors cannot destroy.

The Soviet people will certainly overthrow the Soviet revisionist reactionary rule.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao in China has opened up a brilliant road to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and advance towards communism. The traitor clique of Brezhnev and Kosygin is terrified of this unprecedented cultural revolution. They have spared no effort to curse and slander this great revolution, attempting to continue to deceive the Soviet people and maintain their shaky thrones. However, the broad revolutionary people of the Soviet Union not only do not believe the deceptive propaganda of the Soviet revisionist leadership, but they have also more clearly recognized the lessons of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union from the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat. An ordinary Soviet person said with deep feeling, "If the Soviet Union had also carried out the Cultural Revolution in the past, it would not have become like this." He firmly stated, "Those who have usurped the party and state power of the Soviet Union and taken the capitalist road must all be cleaned out." A Soviet teacher told Chinese comrades, "Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like curse the Chinese Red Guards because the Red Guards are against the restoration of capitalism. What the Red Guards do is good! Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like are all not good people. Two hundred million people in the Soviet Union all oppose them."

The Soviet people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will not tolerate the Soviet revisionist traitor clique riding on their necks and acting arbitrarily for long. Through the cruel reality of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat, more and more Soviet people have come to realize that they must carry out a second revolution, overthrow the revisionist rule, and rebuild the proletarian dictatorship. A Soviet cadre who was removed from his position as party committee secretary for being dissatisfied with the revisionist line of the Soviet revisionist leadership said, "The Soviet people need a revolution." A Soviet worker said, "Khrushchev is not a good person. Brezhnev and Kosygin are also not good people. The Soviet people will eventually kick them out." A middle-aged Soviet person said, "We firmly believe that the second October Revolution will certainly come. We are welcoming this revolution."

The broad masses of the Soviet people, filled with indignation, are taking various forms to fight against the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. It is reported that in recent years, there have been successive strikes and demonstrations against the Soviet revisionist rule in many places in the Soviet Union. In June of this year, the automobile workers in Chymkent angrily attacked and burned down the headquarters of the city militia and a nearby police station. At Moscow University, some young students, fearing persecution and siege, openly exposed the Soviet revisionist leadership's crime of betraying Marxism-Leninism and pursuing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

Chairman Mao pointed out, "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system, which is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will come sooner or later and will certainly be victorious." The reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership will not last long. The great Soviet people will certainly make the Soviet Union return to the socialist track.

    美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。			毛泽东
    苏修集团倒行逆施罪行累累日子不长
    苏联革命人民奋起反抗必将燃起熊熊烈火
    据新华社二十九日讯　本社记者报道：世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席一九六二年曾经指出：“苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”在今天的苏联，历史正在按照毛主席所指出的这个方向发展。
    苏修领导集团这些年来变本加厉地推行修正主义路线，在苏联国内复辟资本主义，在国际上伙同以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派维护资本主义和殖民主义的旧秩序。广大苏联革命人民越来越认清了勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的叛徒面目。他们对苏修领导集团的不满、谴责和斗争正在不断加强，最后必将形成熊熊的革命烈火，彻底摧毁克里姆林宫新沙皇们的反动统治。
              愤怒谴责苏修复辟资本主义的罪行
    苏修领导集团在篡夺党政大权后，在苏联全面复辟资本主义。他们打着“全民国家”的破旗，把伟大列宁所缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家变成资本主义国家，对苏联广大劳动人民实行资产阶级法西斯专政。他们打着“全民党”的幌子，把苏共变成资产阶级的党。他们在“经济改革”的掩护下，把苏联的社会主义经济蜕化成资本主义经济。他们在“全民文化”的招牌下，使资产阶级意识形态统治了苏联的思想文化领域。这一小撮叛徒和工贼，把列宁、斯大林时代欣欣向荣的苏维埃国家糟踏成这个样子，却恬不知耻地把自己打扮成“马克思列宁主义者”和“共产主义建设”的旗手，欺骗苏联人民和全世界人民。但是，苏联人民越来越识破了他们的叛徒面目，认识清了他们背叛伟大列宁的事业，践踏社会主义、共产主义旗帜，在苏联复辟资本主义的罪行。
    许多苏联工人、农民、军人、知识分子和干部愤怒地指出，苏修领导集团，从赫鲁晓夫到勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，根本不是什么“马克思列宁主义者”，而是一批地地道道的修正主义者和资产阶级新贵，他们的“共产主义建设”是假，复辟资本主义是真。几个月前，一位苏联军人对中国同志一语戳破了这些修正主义叛徒的假面具。他说：“勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团是赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的忠实执行者，他们挂着马克思列宁主义的招牌，干的是资本主义的勾当。他们是彻头彻尾的资本家。”在苏联某部门工作的一位干部说，苏修领导集团，“是假列宁主义者，真新型资产阶级。他们背叛了马克思列宁主义，在苏联大搞资本主义。”拉脱维亚共和国首都里加市的一位老工人一针见血地指出，“从赫鲁晓夫集团篡夺苏联的党政大权以后，苏维埃政权实际上已经不存在了。”一位苏联新闻工作者指出，苏修领导集团吹嘘的“共产主义建设”完全是假的。他说，现在“苏联根本没有社会主义。”
    许多劳动群众和革命知识分子在谈话中普遍指出，在今天的苏联，根本没有劳动人民的民主和自由，劳动人民完全处于以苏修领导集团为代表的资产阶级特权阶层的压迫和奴役之下。一位老工人说，“斯大林时期，谁也不敢欺侮工人，而现在，工人处处受压迫”。一位建筑工人对中国同志说：“现在苏联到处有特务钉梢，劳动人民没有言论自由。”
    许多人在谈话中对在苏修领导集团统治下物价不断上涨、阶级分化日益加剧、广大劳动人民在经济上受剥削的状况提出了强烈的控诉。他们揭露说，在资本主义已经复辟的苏联，“少数人越来越富，大多数人越来越穷”，苏修领导集团推行“新体制”，进一步加强了对劳动人民的剥削。一位苏联教员说，苏修领导集团“在苏联干的完全是复辟资本主义。在苏联的工厂机关里，一小撮特权阶层分子不劳动，却收入很多，普通职工受他们的剥削”。一位曾经参加过卫国战争的残废军人说：“我在保卫斯大林格勒战役中失去了双腿，可是现在受他们（苏修领导集团）欺凌，我的生活很苦。”一位汽车司机说，他现在收入很少，“连点肉都买不起，买件毛衣得花两个月的工资”。他说，现在苏联劳动人民的生活“比斯大林在世的时候差远了。”
                  坚决反对苏修联美反华的勾当
    苏修叛徒集团在对外政策方面无耻地背叛了无产阶级国际主义，一贯推行“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”、“和平过渡”的投降主义路线，伙同美帝国主义和各国反动派极力破坏和镇压世界各国人民的革命斗争，疯狂地反对世界革命的坚强堡垒——中国。他们的这些滔天罪行，遭到苏联革命人民越来越强烈的谴责和反对。
    不少苏联朋友对中国同志斩钉截铁地表示：苏联人民坚决反对苏修集团所奉行的反革命修正主义对外政策。里加的一位老人愤怒地说，苏修集团是在“执行美国的意志”。莫斯科的一位青年学生指出，“现在苏联的领导人已经同美帝国主义勾结在一起了。”一位参加过卫国战争的老工人在揭露苏修领导集团同美帝国主义的勾结时，十分气愤地说：“现在，西方的魔鬼都成了克里姆林宫的上宾！”
    苏联劳动人民强烈谴责苏修领导集团配合美帝国主义破坏越南人民抗美救国战争的罪行。几位乌克兰工人说：“我们坚决反对帝国主义的侵略战争，我们支持越南人民的抗美救国战争和其它一切正义的战争”。他们表示坚决反对苏修领导集团“反对一切战争”的修正主义观点。苏修领导集团今年六月在中东事件中出卖阿拉伯人民利益的可耻行为，也引起广大苏联革命人民的愤怒，他们痛斥这是“十足的叛徒行为”。
    中苏两国人民之间有着悠久的深厚的友谊。苏修领导集团所奉行的联美反华的反动政策遭到了苏联广大人民最坚决、最强烈的反对和抵制。苏联劳动人民在遇到中国同志时都非常亲切，视同家人。不少人不顾苏修特务、打手的威胁和迫害，公开地表示：他们坚决反对苏修领导集团的反华政策，坚定地站在当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席一边，他们将永远同中国人民友好。波罗的海海滨的一位老人说：“毛泽东是真正的马克思列宁主义者”。格鲁吉亚的一位医务工作者说：“我们赞成中国共产党所奉行的马克思列宁主义的路线”。一位苏联工人说：“我们苏联人民最热爱中国人民。现在苏联的政府不能代表我国人民，让勃列日涅夫和柯西金见鬼去吧！”一位苏联军官极为真挚地对中国同志说：“由斯大林同志和毛泽东同志亲手缔造起来的伟大的苏中两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的。”他说：“一旦有人胆敢进犯中国，你们将会看到，正直的苏联军人一定会同中国人民站在一起。”这些苏联普通群众的谈话生动地表明：苏修集团的反华政策在苏联是极不得人心的。中苏两国人民之间的伟大友谊绝不是一小撮苏修叛徒所能破坏得了的。
    苏联人民必将摧毁苏修反动统治
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，开辟了一条巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟、通向共产主义的光辉道路。勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团，对这场史无前例的文化大革命怕得要死。他们费尽心机，咒骂、毁谤这场大革命，妄图继续欺骗苏联人民，维持自己摇摇欲坠的宝座。但是，广大苏联革命人民，不仅不相信苏修领导集团的欺骗性宣传，相反，他们从中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利中，更加清楚地认识到苏联资本主义复辟的教训。一位普通的苏联人深有所感地说：“假如苏联过去也搞了文化大革命，就不至于变成现在这个样子了。”他坚定地表示，“需要把那些篡夺了苏联党政大权的走资本主义道路的坏蛋统统清除掉。”一位苏联教师对中国同志说：“勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流骂中国红卫兵，是因为红卫兵是反对资本主义复辟的。你们的红卫兵干得就是好！勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流统统不是好人。苏联两亿人民都反对他们。”
    有着光荣革命传统的苏联人民，是决不会长期容忍苏修叛徒集团骑在自己的脖子上作威作福的。通过苏联资本主义复辟的残酷现实和中国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利，越来越多的苏联人民已经认识到，必须进行第二次革命，推翻修正主义的统治，重建无产阶级专政。由于不满意苏修领导集团的修正主义路线而被撤掉党委书记职务的一位苏联干部说：“苏联人民需要革命。”一位苏联工人说：“赫鲁晓夫不是好人。勃列日涅夫、柯西金也不是好人。苏联人民迟早是要把他们一脚踢开的。”一位苏联中年人说：“我们坚信，第二次十月革命必将到来。我们正在迎接这次革命。”
    充满了满腔怒火的苏联广大群众正在采取各种各样的方式同苏修叛徒集团进行斗争。据透露，近几年来，苏联不少地方曾相继发生反对苏修统治的罢工和示威。今年六月，奇姆肯特市汽车工人愤怒地袭击和焚毁了市民警总部和附近的一个派出所。在莫斯科大学，一些青年学生不怕迫害和围攻，公开揭露苏修领导集团背叛马克思列宁主义，推行反革命修正主义路线的罪行。
    毛主席指出：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”苏修领导集团的反动统治，决不会长久。伟大的苏联人民必定会使苏联重新回到社会主义的轨道上来。
