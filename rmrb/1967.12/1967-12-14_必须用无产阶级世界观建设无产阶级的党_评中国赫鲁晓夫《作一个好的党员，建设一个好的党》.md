Our great leader Chairman Mao has always placed ideological construction at the forefront of party-building work. He teaches us, “Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles.” In 1942, Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art: “Our party, our army, although most of them are pure, in order to lead the revolutionary movement to develop better and complete it faster, we must thoroughly rectify it in terms of ideology and organization. And to rectify the organization, we must first rectify the ideology, and carry out a struggle between the proletarian ideology and the non-proletarian ideology.”

The ideological construction of the party is to educate the whole party with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to educate party members to use the proletarian worldview to overcome the bourgeois worldview, and to break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us that only through class struggle, revolutionary practice, and close ties with the masses can we promote ideological revolutionization and fundamentally transform our worldview. Communists must be tested in the great storms of mass movements. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best battlefield for us to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism.

The revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev is completely opposite to Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line. In 1940, when the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression was raging and the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek was frantically carrying out anti-communist activities, he put forward the poisonous weed "Being a Good Party Member, Building a Good Party." He said: In order to build a "good party," the most basic requirement is to have many "good party members." How can one become a "good party member"? He asked people to completely detach themselves from the then fiery class struggle and engage in "self-cultivation" and "self-examination" behind closed doors. He proposed three standards for being a "good party member," all of which were circuitous ways of advocating bourgeois individualism, a complete "selfishness manual."

Analyzing this poisonous weed can help people understand how the Chinese Khrushchev used the bourgeois worldview to corrupt our party members and attempted to change the nature of our party.

Firmly Fighting Selfishness to Establish Public-Mindedness

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works wholeheartedly for the interests of the people.” “Communist Party members, at all times and in all places, should not place personal interests first, but should subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people.”

The Chinese Khrushchev, a vulgar bourgeois, desperately peddles the exploitative class's philosophy of selfishness. He first says: Some party members are "cherishing, economical, diligent, and responsible" towards their own things, but towards things belonging to the party and the public, they are "not cherishing, not economical, not diligent, and not responsible." We say, such people are obviously selfish, and only by firmly fighting selfishness can public-mindedness be established. However, the Chinese Khrushchev says that the mistake of such people lies only in "not understanding" the "consistency" between their own things and the party's things. He says that the way to correct this is: Party members should treat the party's public things as their own things. In this way, they possess what he calls the first standard of a "good party member," that is, "cherishing every thing of the party as one's own."

This is truly absurd and reactionary logic!

According to the Chinese Khrushchev's logic, when a communist party member faces a task, he should not first think of the party's and revolutionary interests, but should first think of his own and personal interests; he should consider whether this task is beneficial to himself and whether it is "consistent" with personal interests, weighing every detail. If it is "consistent," he will do it; if it is not "consistent," he will not do it. For personal gain, he will work hard; for revolutionary interests, he will not contribute a penny. What kind of "good party member" is this? This is a political speculator in the style of the Chinese Khrushchev.

According to the Chinese Khrushchev's logic, if a communist party member is infected with the root of all evil, "selfishness," it is not only not illegal or shameful, but it is also legal and glorious, and it should be protected, indulged, and developed, and it should be used as the driving force for one's work. Because, as long as the party member treats public things as his own, turning public into private, he will "cherish, economize, be diligent, and responsible."

According to the Chinese Khrushchev's logic, a person with heavy selfishness, as long as he wears the mask of "public," can become the best party member. In this way, those selfish individuals who use public for private gain, those two-faced and treacherous personal careerists, those traitors who, under the pretext of "the party's work needs," fawn on class enemies and betray the revolution, etc., are they not all "good party members"?

The Chinese Khrushchev talks about the "consistency" between one's own things and the party's things. What kind of "consistency" is this? He says: "Party members can only have their own victories in the party's victories." Therefore, "striving for the development, success, and victory of the party's cause" can "develop oneself and improve oneself." Originally, in the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, doing work for the party is merely a means, and seeking one's own development, success, and victory is his true purpose. "Selfishness" is his driving force and also his ultimate goal.

The Chinese Khrushchev spreads his set of bourgeois worldviews that turn public into private everywhere. Going to the mountains to fight guerrilla warfare is to "become a general," going to the countryside to be a peasant is to "become a county magistrate," working hard is to "show off," working diligently is to "get along." In short, the "victory of the party" is only a ladder set up to pursue "one's own victory." He fears that others might not understand clearly, so he specially introduces himself as a "model" and says that he joined the party when he "could not solve his personal problems," although he "had not attended university," he "was the first generation to participate in the revolution and is now a member of the Central Committee"; "I am not the first, but I am the second."

This is indeed the perfect confession of this individualist careerist. Originally, this "old revolutionary" was just a speculator who joined the revolutionary ranks to solve personal problems and seek his own victory. His body joined the party, but his mind was full of extremely reactionary bourgeois worldviews, and he was extremely stubborn, not willing to accept any reform at all; not only that, he also wanted to use this set of ideas to reform our party and corrupt the broad masses of party members.

Starting from "selfishness," using "selfishness" as the driving force, under the pretext of "public," achieving the purpose of "selfishness." This is the philosophy of life that the Chinese Khrushchev has been talking about for a long time to be a "good party member."

For Public or for Private, This is the Fundamental Opposition Between the Proletariat and the Bourgeoisie

A true revolutionary, a true communist party member who is the vanguard of the proletariat, must use the proletarian worldview to overcome the bourgeois worldview, and must constantly and uncompromisingly fight against the "selfishness" in one's own mind in the great storms of class struggle. Only by firmly fighting and breaking down selfishness can public-mindedness be established, and one can become a true communist party member who does not seek fame or wealth, is not afraid of hardship or death, does not seek personal gain, and wholeheartedly serves the revolution, the people, and the Chinese and world peoples, as Chairman Mao teaches us.

Communist Party Members Should Devote Themselves to the Revolution

Chairman Mao teaches us: “A communist party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, and regard revolutionary interests as his first life, and subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests.” The sole purpose of a communist party member's life is to make revolution, to live for the revolution, and to die for the revolution.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev, like a speculator, shakes his head and says while playing with an abacus: “How can one be considered worthy as a person, especially as a communist party member?” “How can a communist party member be considered worthy of sacrifice? And how can it be considered unworthy?”

Then, he starts to talk about "business" on this issue. He says that some people think that if one has not had a big feast, not lived a comfortable and luxurious life, not had a woman, and so on, and has sacrificed, it is not worth it for one's life. The Chinese Khrushchev calculates for these people and says that these things cannot be done because "this is completely incompatible with the party membership of a communist." Being expelled from the party, "in the end, it may turn out to be not worth it." He thinks he is smarter than these people. Therefore, he proposes the second standard of a "good party member": "Sacrificing for the party's and the working people's public affairs is the most worthy."

Why is it "most worthy"? Look, he calculates: Sacrificing for these things, even sacrificing one's life, is "most worthy" because it "most arouses people's admiration and is most remembered and praised by future generations." Moreover, they do not necessarily die, so "although they may suffer a little in some personal enjoyments, they are, or in the end, trusted and respected by us and the masses. That is to say, they are the most worthy." Based on such reasons, the Chinese Khrushchev says: "Those party members who suffer first and enjoy later are our good party members."

His calculations are so "clever"!

On the surface, he seems to be opposing those who seek big feasts and luxurious lives, but what does he use to replace this individualism? It is to "arouse people's admiration" and to be "remembered and praised by future generations." Originally, he just uses seeking fame to replace seeking gain, using one individualism to replace another. In our long feudal society, Confucianism advocates "the highest is to establish virtue, the next is to establish merit, the next is to establish words, even if it is not lasting, this is called immortality"; it says to "leave a good name for a hundred generations," etc. The Chinese Khrushchev is well versed in this, and he has even bluntly said: "When writing history in the future, writing your name, what more personal fame can there be than this!"

In fact, seeking fame is also for the sake of gaining benefits. With "fame," becoming a "big official," big feasts, and luxurious lives can naturally be achieved. This is the clever use of the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of "suffering a little loss to gain a big advantage." In his view, sacrificing for the party's cause is "suffering a little loss," and thus obtaining personal fame and status is "gaining a big advantage." In "Cultivation," he quotes Mencius' words "first suffer hardships in the mind, labor in the bones, starve the body," all for the sake of being able to undertake "great tasks" in the future, becoming a big official, gaining great fame, and obtaining great benefits. In 1957, he even told a group of young students: "You suffer first and gain later. Without suffering the bitterest suffering, you will not know the sweetest sweetness."

Therefore, the Chinese Khrushchev's "suffering first and enjoying later" is by no means truly placing revolutionary interests first, but first suffering for the sake of later enjoyment. Suffering is a pretext, a means; enjoyment and gain are the true purpose. This is the unadulterated business philosophy of a speculator who "sacrifices one to gain a thousand," and it is also the philosophy of life of a decadent feudal scholar who "suffers the bitterest suffering to become a superior person."

The Chinese Khrushchev advocates this set of ideas to make people pretend to be active, first suffer a little, deceive the party and the people's "trust" and "respect," and seek the shameful goal of gaining both fame and wealth and usurping power to enjoy. All conspirators and careerists who attempt to usurp the party and the country are such hypocritical pharisees. The Soviet Khrushchev is such a pharisee, and the Chinese Khrushchev is also such a pharisee. He shamelessly advocates his set of pharisee philosophy, attempting to use it to corrupt our party members and change the color of our party. This is how despicable it is!

Communist party members should devote themselves to the revolution. As long as it is beneficial to the revolution, they should fear no sacrifice and wholeheartedly do it, and they should not consider personal gain and ask what is "worthy" or not. When Liu Hulan, Dong Cunrui, and Qiu Shaoyun bravely sacrificed themselves, did they think about what was "worthy" or not? When the heroes of the Fourth Platoon and Comrade Li Wenzhong fearlessly rushed to rescue the Red Guards in danger, was it for the sake of being "admired" and "praised" by others? No! The Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense is a great insult to the lofty thoughts of the heroes and martyrs. These communist warriors who devote themselves to the public think of the revolution, the collective cause of the proletariat, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, not themselves. Lei Feng did many good deeds but did not want others to know. Mai Xiande humbly treated the praise of his comrades. They are all good examples for us to learn from. We should be like them, constantly and unceasingly fighting against the "selfishness" in our minds. We must fight it fiercely and break it thoroughly to completely uproot the "selfishness."

If, like the Chinese Khrushchev, one calculates "worthy" or not in everything, looks at whether it is "consistent" with one's own interests, and wants to obtain others' "admiration" and "praise," then one's selfishness will only grow bigger and deeper. Such a person, when the revolution reaches a critical moment and requires them to make sacrifices, will immediately reveal their true colors. At that time, on the scale of their weighing "worthy" or not, they will put the weight of "better to live a miserable life than to die a good death." Such a person, not only cannot sacrifice for the revolution, but will definitely become a deserter, live a miserable life, betray comrades, and betray the revolution. Isn't history like this? Among the so-called "good party members" and "good cadres" who have been protected and promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, isn't there a small group of cowards who fear death, betray the revolution, and surrender to the party?

Revolutionaries Rely on Mao Zedong Thought

Comrade Vice Chairman Lin recently called on us: "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and making the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Among the countless principles for communists, studying Mao Zedong Thought is the first.

Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism that transforms people's souls, the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat, and is fundamentally opposed to the ideology of private ownership and the exploiting class. We study Mao Zedong Thought to constantly transform our thoughts in the great storms of class struggle and mass movements, firmly break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, thoroughly break down the bourgeois worldview, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can we distinguish the direction in the complex class struggle, maintain the proletarian standpoint, and become the vanguard fighters of the proletariat, true communist party members.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev, in the entire article, does not mention learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought at all, does not mention that communist party members should, while transforming the objective world, also transform their subjective world, but proposes his so-called third standard of a "good party member": "To be a lifelong good party member." He repeatedly declares that "one must be a lifelong party member," "this is absolutely unchangeable," "it cannot be changed," and talks at length about "with this unchangeable, then everything else can be changed according to different situations."

We have seen that in the poisonous weed "Being a Good Party Member, Building a Good Party," the Chinese Khrushchev talks about one thing that is unchangeable, that is, to insist on the bourgeois worldview. Everything starts from "selfishness," seeking fame and gain, seeking one's own victory. No matter how he covers up the "selfishness" with grandiose words, or uses one kind of individualism to replace another, it is all the same, his stinking "selfishness" is "absolutely unchangeable."

Now we see his second "unchangeable," that is, the signboard of "communist party member" is absolutely "unchangeable."

These two "unchangeables" together form a typical hypocrite and two-faced person. The bourgeois worldview is the essence of this hypocrite and two-faced person, the idea of private ownership and the exploiting class has deeply rooted and permeated every cell. But on the surface, he must definitely hang up the signboard of a communist party member, using it as capital to seek fame, gain, position, and to show off. "Speaking of benevolence and righteousness, doing the work of male and female thieves." The Chinese Khrushchev truly understands the philosophy of the exploiting class of Confucius and Mencius.

In the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev, as long as his bourgeois worldview does not change, and the signboard of "communist party member" does not change, then everything else can "change according to different situations." The revolutionary stance, principles, and integrity of communist party members can all be thrown aside, and all kinds of ghostly and demonic means can be used, and all kinds of despicable and shameful things can be done.

The life of the Chinese Khrushchev is a living specimen of his philosophy of "lifelong unchangeable" and "thousand changes." During the time at the Anshan Coal Mine, he hung the signboard of "worker leader," but did the work of currying favor with the capitalists and betraying the working class; during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, he called himself the "model of white area work," but was actually the head of the traitor group; after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, this man who regarded himself as "China's Marx" jumped out to become the "parliamentary fanatic" who attempted to hand over the people's armed forces and betray the revolution; after the liberation of the whole country, this "first generation of revolution" wanted to be a "red comprador," and even incited capitalists to "fight" against workers; during the socialist revolution, this "great figure" who is "not the first, but the second," became the backstage supporter of the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements who plotted to restore capitalism; in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he has reached the brink of destruction, but has not forgotten to put on a "old revolutionary" hat, "standing on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, suppressing the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, confusing right and wrong, confusing black and white, besieging the revolutionary faction, suppressing different opinions, implementing white terror, thinking he is successful, showing off the bourgeois arrogance, crushing the proletarian spirit, how poisonous it is!"

No matter how the Chinese Khrushchev changes a thousand times, he is, as Comrade Vice Chairman Lin says: "Many people hang the signboard of Marxism, the signboard of Mao Zedong Thought, but in reality, they oppose Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought. They hang the signboard of communist party members, but in reality, they are anti-communists."

The Chinese Khrushchev is our negative example.

In the poisonous weed "Being a Good Party Member, Building a Good Party," he incessantly instills the bourgeois worldview into party members. The three standards of a "good party member" he proposes, over and over again, are just peddling the "selfishness." He attempts to transform our party members into exploiting class speculators and two-faced people who center around "me" and are selfish. He says that with such "good party members," a "good party" can be built. We see that using his methods to "build the party," it can only build a party of landlords and capitalists who fight for fame and gain and scheme against each other, a revisionist party, a fascist party.

This poisonous weed has educated us from the opposite side, making us understand a truth: Only with the proletarian worldview can the proletarian party be built.

In Chairman Mao's proletarian party-building line, ideological construction occupies the foremost position. The ultimate goal of the Communist Party is to realize communism throughout the world. We not only want to eliminate all old politics and old economy and establish new politics and new economy, but also want to eliminate old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and establish new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits. Dialectical materialism attaches great importance to the role of ideology. Only the proletarian ideology can serve the new economic base of socialism and promote and accelerate social development. Only proletarian thought can become the basis for uniting and unifying our entire party, can inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of party members, raise the class consciousness of party members, and become a great force to promote social revolution.

The core of the proletarian worldview is "public-mindedness," and the core of the bourgeois worldview and all exploiting classes is "selfishness." The traditional thoughts of the exploiting class have ruled people for thousands of years and have a deep influence, and it requires hard work to overcome them. Therefore, towards "selfishness," it must be thoroughly broken down, not partially or moderately, and certainly not "broken" in the way of the Chinese Khrushchev. If, like the Chinese Khrushchev, using some beautiful words to protect "selfishness," it can only sink deeper and deeper into the swamp of "selfishness." Only by thoroughly breaking down "selfishness" can "public-mindedness" be thoroughly established.

The thought that best represents the proletarian thought, the communist thought, and the Marxism-Leninism thought is the thought of our great leader Chairman Mao. Only by thoroughly studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought can we oppose various kinds of exploiting class thoughts and revisionist thoughts. Therefore, the ideological construction work of our party is to vigorously carry out the education of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the party, to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought within the party, and to let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions.

Through this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly criticizing and purging the influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist thought represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, our entire party will be more firmly united under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Every communist party member must regard studying Mao Zedong Thought as the first need of life, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime, fight against "selfishness" for a lifetime, criticize "revisionism" for a lifetime, make the revolution for a lifetime, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao for a lifetime. We must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

　　必须用无产阶级世界观建设无产阶级的党
　　——评中国赫鲁晓夫《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》
　　通信兵机关无产阶级革命派
    我们伟大领袖毛主席一向把思想建设摆在建党工作的首要地位。他教导我们说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”一九四二年，毛主席在《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中指出：“我们的党，我们的队伍，虽然其中的大部分是纯洁的，但是为要领导革命运动更好地发展，更快地完成，就必须从思想上组织上认真地整顿一番。而为要从组织上整顿，首先需要在思想上整顿，需要展开一个无产阶级对非无产阶级的思想斗争。”
    党的思想建设，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想教育全党，教育党员用无产阶级世界观去克服资产阶级世界观，要破私立公。毛主席一再教导我们，要通过阶级斗争、革命实践和密切联系群众，才能促进思想革命化，彻底改造世界观。共产党人必须在群众运动的大风大浪中去经受考验，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，就是我们斗私批修的最好战场。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，完全同毛主席的无产阶级建党路线唱反调。一九四○年，正当抗日战争烽火漫天，人民公敌蒋介石疯狂进行反共活动的时候，他抛出了《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》这株大毒草。他说：为要建设一个“好的党”，最基本的是要有许多“好党员”。怎样才能成为“好党员”呢？他要人们完全脱离当时火热的阶级斗争，而去闭门“修养”，“检查自己”。他提出了作“好党员”的三个标准，完全是转弯抹角地宣扬资产阶级个人主义，是一本彻头彻尾的“私”字经。
    解剖这株大毒草，可以帮助人们了解中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样以资产阶级的世界观来腐蚀我们党员，妄图篡改我们党的性质的。
    坚决破私　才能立公
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个满身铜臭的市侩，却拚命向党员兜售剥削阶级的唯私哲学。他首先提出来说：有些党员对自己的事物，是“爱惜的，节省的，尽心的，负责的”，而对属于党的公共的事物，却是“不爱惜的，不节省的，不尽心的，不负责的”。我们说，这样的人，当然是“私”字当头的人，只有坚决破私，才能立公。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却说，这种人的错误，仅仅在于“不了解”自己的事物和党的事物之间有“一致性”。他说，纠正的办法是：党员应该把党的公共的事物，统统“当作自己的事物”。这样，就具有了他所谓的“好党员”的第一个标准，即“爱护党的每一个事物，如自己的事物一样”。
    这真是荒谬绝伦的反动逻辑！
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的逻辑，共产党员一事当前，不是首先想到党的、革命的利益，而是要首先想到自己的、个人的利益；计较这件事情对自己是否有利，同个人利益是否有“一致性”，斤两必究，锱铢必较。同个人利益有“一致性”的就干，没有“一致性”的就不干。为个人私利则拚命地干，为革命利益就一毛不拔。这是什么“好党员”？这是中国赫鲁晓夫式的政治投机商。
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的逻辑，一个共产党员染上了万恶之源的“私”字，不但不是非法的、可耻的，用不着进行批评、教育、斗争和改造，相反，这倒是合法的、光荣的，应当保护它、纵容它、发展它，并且要以它作为自己工作的动力。因为，党员只要把公共的东西“当作自己的事物”，化公为私，他就会“爱惜、节省、尽心、负责”起来了。
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的逻辑，私心很重的人，只要戴上为“公”的假面具，就可以成为最好的党员了。这样，那些自私自利，假公济私的个人主义者，那些阳奉阴违，两面三刀的个人野心家，那些借口“党的工作需要”，对阶级敌人摇尾乞怜，出卖革命的叛徒，等等，岂不统统都是“好党员”了吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫说什么自己的事物和党的事物是有“一致性”的。什么样的“一致性”呢？他说：“党员只有在党的胜利中才会有自己的胜利。”因此，“争取党的事业的发展、成功和胜利”，就能“发展自己，提高自己”。原来，在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，为党干工作，仅仅是手段，求得自己的发展、成功和胜利，才是他的真正目的。“私”字是他工作的动力，也是他的最终目的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫到处散布他这套化公为私的资产阶级世界观。上山打游击是为了“当将军”，下乡做农民是为了“当县长”，埋头苦干为的是“出风头”，安心工作为的是“吃得开”。总之，“党的胜利”，不过是为了追逐“自己的胜利”而架设的阶梯。他唯恐别人听了还不够明白，又特地介绍他自己这个“样板”说，他是“个人问题横竖解决不了”时跑到党内来的，虽然“未进过大学”，但“参加革命我是第一代，现在成为中央委员”；“我现在不是数第一，也是数第二”。
    这确实是他这个个人主义野心家绝妙的自白。原来他这个“老革命”，不过是为了解决个人问题，谋求自己的胜利而混进革命队伍里来的投机政客。他的身子混进了党，头脑中却满满地装着极端反动的资产阶级世界观，而且非常顽固，丝毫不肯接受改造；不仅如此，他还要拿这一套来改造我们的党，腐蚀广大党员群众。
    从“私”字出发，以“私”字为动力，打着为“公”的幌子，达到为“私”的目的。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫给我们唠叨了半天的“作一个好党员”的处世哲学。
    为公还是为私，这是无产阶级同资产阶级两种根本对立的思想，两种根本对立的世界观。一个真正的革命者，一个真正的无产阶级先锋队的共产党员，必须用无产阶级世界观来克服资产阶级世界观，必须在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，和自己头脑里的“私”字不断进行毫不调和的斗争。坚决斗私、破私，才能立公，才能做到象毛主席教导我们的，成为不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，毫不利己，专门利人，一心为革命，一心为人民，全心全意地为中国人民和世界人民服务的真正的共产党员。
    共产党员要一心为革命
    毛主席教导我们：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。共产党员一生的唯一目的，就是为了干革命，为革命而生，为革命而死。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫，活象一个投机商人，边拨拉着算盘，边摇头晃脑地说：“作一个人，特别作一个共产党员，要怎样才算值得呢？”“要怎样牺牲对于一个共产党员才是值得？又怎样才是不值得呢？”
    于是，他在这个问题上大谈起“生意经”来了。他说，有些人“认为一生没有大吃大喝过，没有过过舒适的奢侈的生活，没有嫖过女人，……而牺牲了，对于人生是不值得的”。中国赫鲁晓夫替这些人打了一下算盘，说，这些事不能干，因为，“这与共产党员的党籍是完全不能同时并存的。”被开除党籍，“最后可能弄一个不值得”。他究竟比这些人高明一筹。于是，他提出来“好党员”的第二个标准：“为党的与劳苦大众的公共事业而牺牲，是最值得的。”
    为什么“最值得”呢？你看，他打的算盘：为这些事情牺牲奋斗，甚至牺牲自己的生命，是“最值得”的，因为这样“最引起人们的敬仰，最为万世子孙所怀念所歌颂”。何况，他们不一定死，那末，“虽然在某些个人享受上，他们暂时吃一点亏，然而他们是，或者最后是，为我们大家及群众所信任，所尊敬的。也就是说，他们是最值得的”。根据这样的理由，中国赫鲁晓夫说：“那些吃苦在前，享福在后的党员，是我们的好党员”。
    他的算盘打得多么“精明”！
    表面上，他好象是在反对那些贪图大吃大喝、奢侈生活的个人主义，但他用来代替这种个人主义的是什么呢？是要“引起人们的敬仰，为万世子孙所怀念所歌颂”。原来他不过是用求名来代替求利，用一种个人主义去代替另一种个人主义而已。我国长期封建社会孔孟之道宣扬什么“太上有立德，其次有立功，其次有立言，虽久不废，此之谓不朽”；说什么要“流芳百世”等等。中国赫鲁晓夫是深通此道的，他还赤裸裸地说过：“将来写历史的时候，写上你一个名字，个人名利莫过于这个吧”！
    其实，求名也还是为了可以得利，有了“名”，做了“大官”，大吃大喝、奢侈生活自然也都可以办到了。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的“吃小亏，占大便宜”哲学的妙用。在他看来，为党的事业而牺牲，是“吃小亏”，因此而得到个人的名誉地位，就是“占大便宜”。他在《修养》中引孟子的话“必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤”，都是为的将来可以担当“大任”，做大官，获大名，得大利。一九五七年，他居然对一批青年学生说：“你们吃苦在前，得利在后。不经苦中苦，不知甜上甜”。
    所以，中国赫鲁晓夫说的“吃苦在前，享福在后”，决不是真正将革命利益摆在第一位，而是先吃苦，为了后享乐。吃苦是幌子，是手段；享乐、得利才是真正的目的。这是不折不扣的投机商人“舍一本，求万利”的生意经，也是腐朽的封建士大夫“吃得苦中苦，方为人上人”的处世哲学。
    中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬这一套，就是要人们伪装积极，先吃一点苦，骗取党和人民的“信任”、“尊敬”，以求达到名利兼收、篡权享福的可耻目的。一切妄图篡党窃国的大阴谋家、大野心家都是这样欺世盗名的伪君子，苏联的赫鲁晓夫是这样的伪君子，中国的赫鲁晓夫也是这样的伪君子。他居然恬不知耻地宣扬他这套伪君子的哲学，妄图以此来腐蚀我们党员，改变我们党的颜色，这是多么可耻！
    共产党员应该一心为革命。只要有利于革命的事情，就应该不怕牺牲，全心全意地去做，决不应考虑个人的私利，问什么“值得不值得”。难道刘胡兰、董存瑞、邱少云他们英勇牺牲的时候，想到什么“值得不值得”吗？难道英雄四排和李文忠同志奋不顾身去抢救红卫兵出险，是为的要别人“敬仰”和“歌颂”吗？不！中国赫鲁晓夫这些谰言，是对英雄烈士们的崇高思想的极大污蔑。这些一心为公的共产主义战士，想到的是革命，是无产阶级的集体事业，是毛主席的革命路线，决不是自己。雷锋做了许多好事，不愿别人知道，麦贤得谦虚地对待同志们对他的赞扬。他们都是我们学习的好榜样。我们要象他们那样，时时刻刻不断地和自己头脑中的“私”字作斗争。要大斗特斗，大破特破，才能彻底挖掉“私”字的根。
    如果象中国赫鲁晓夫那样，事事处处都要盘算一个“值得不值得”，都要看看和自己的利益有没有“一致性”，都要想得到别人的“敬仰”和“歌颂”，那末，就必然是“私”心越来越大，越陷越深。这样的人，一到革命的紧要关头，需要他们作出牺牲的时候，立刻就会现出原形。那时，在他们衡量“值得不值得”的天平上，就会换上“好死不如赖活”的砝码。这种人，不仅不能为革命牺牲，反而必然会当逃兵，苟且偷生，出卖同志，背叛革命。历史事实不正是这样吗？被中国赫鲁晓夫一直包庇重用的所谓“好党员”“好干部”中，不正有那么一小撮贪生怕死、出卖革命、叛党自首的无耻之徒吗？
    干革命靠毛泽东思想
    林副主席最近号召我们：“大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。共产党员千条万条，学习毛泽东思想第一条。
    毛泽东思想是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器，是同私有制思想、剥削阶级思想根本对立的。我们学习毛泽东思想，就是要在阶级斗争和群众运动的大风大浪中，不断地改造思想，坚决破私立公，大破资产阶级世界观，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这样，才能在复杂的阶级斗争中，明辨方向，坚持无产阶级的立场，才能成为无产阶级的先锋战士，做一个真正的共产党员。
    然而，中国赫鲁晓夫在整篇文章中，闭口不谈学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，闭口不谈共产党员要在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界，却提出他的所谓“好党员”的第三个标准：“要作一个终身的好党员”。他一再声称，“要作一个终身的党员”，“这是绝对不能变的”，“变不得的”，并且大谈特谈“有了这一点不变，然后其他一切才可以根据情况的不同而千变万化”。
    我们已经看到，在《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》这株大毒草中，中国赫鲁晓夫说来说去，有一点是不变的，那就是要坚持资产阶级世界观。一切从“私”字出发，求名求利，求得自己的胜利。无论他用什么冠冕堂皇的话把“私”字掩饰起来，或者用这一种个人主义来代替那一种个人主义，万变不离其宗，他那个臭而又臭的“私”字，“是绝对不能变的”。
    现在我们又看到他的第二个“不变”了，那就是“共产党员”这块招牌，是绝对“变不得的”。
    这两个“不变”合在一起，就成了一个最最典型的伪君子、两面派。资产阶级世界观是这个两面派、伪君子的实质，私有观念、剥削阶级观念，已经根深蒂固，渗透到他的每一个细胞。但在表面上，他又一定要挂起共产党员的招牌，以此作为他争名利、争权位、争出风头的资本。“讲的是仁义道德，干的是男盗女娼”。中国赫鲁晓夫是真正领悟了孔孟之道这套剥削者的哲学的。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫看来，只要他的资产阶级世界观不变，只要“共产党员”的招牌不变，其他一切就都可以“根据情况的不同而千变万化”了。共产党员的革命立场、原则、气节，都可以抛在一边，一切魑魅魍魉的手法都可以使尽，什么卑鄙无耻的事情都干得出来。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的一生，就为他这个“终身不变”和“千变万化”的哲学，树立了活的标本。在安源煤矿的时候，他挂着“工人领袖”的牌子，干的却是向资本家献媚讨好，出卖工人阶级的工贼勾当；在第二次国内革命战争时期，他自称是“白区工作模范”，实际是叛徒集团的头子；抗日战争胜利以后，这个以“中国的马克思”自居的家伙，跳出来成为妄图交出人民武装，出卖革命的“议会迷”；全国解放以后，这个“革命的第一代”，又想当“红色买办”，还鼓动资本家向工人作“斗争”；社会主义革命时期，他这个“不是数第一，也是数第二”的“大人物”，成为阴谋复辟资本主义的反革命修正主义分子的总后台；在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他已经到了行将灭顶之时，还没有忘记抢上一顶“老革命”的帽子，“站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！”
    无论中国赫鲁晓夫怎么千变万化，他就是象林副主席说的：“不少人挂着马克思主义的招牌，毛泽东思想的招牌，实际上反对马克思主义，反对毛泽东思想。他们挂着共产党员的招牌，实际上是反共分子。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫是我们的反面教员。
    在《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》这株大毒草中，他喋喋不休地向党员灌输资产阶级世界观。他提出来的“好党员”的三条标准，翻来复去，就是贩卖一个“私”字。他妄图将我们党员改造成为以“我”为中心、一心为“私”的剥削阶级投机分子、两面派。他说，有了这样的“好党员”，就可以建成“好的党”。我们看到，用他的这套办法来“建党”，就只能建成一个争名夺利、勾心斗角的地主资本家的党、修正主义的党、法西斯的党。
    这株大毒草从反面教育了我们，使我们懂得一条真理：必须用无产阶级世界观，才能建设无产阶级的党。
    在毛主席的无产阶级建党路线中，思想建设占居首要地位。共产党最终的目的，是要在全世界实现共产主义。我们不但要消灭一切旧政治、旧经济，建立起新政治、新经济，而且还要消灭旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，建立起新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯。辩证唯物论十分重视意识形态的作用。只有无产阶级的意识形态，才能为社会主义的新经济基础服务，对社会发展起促进和加速的作用。只有无产阶级思想，才能成为团结和统一我们全党的基础，才能激发党员的革命热情，提高党员的阶级觉悟，成为推动社会革命的巨大力量。
    无产阶级世界观的核心是“公”字，资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的世界观的核心是“私”字。剥削阶级传统思想，已经统治了人们几千年，影响很深，必须艰苦努力，才能克服它。因此，对于“私”字，必须大破，不是小破，也不能中破，当然更不能象中国赫鲁晓夫那样假“破”。要是象中国赫鲁晓夫那样用一些漂亮的言词把“私”字保护起来，那就只能在“私”字的臭泥坑中越陷越深。只有大破“私”字，才能大立“公”字。
    最能代表无产阶级思想的，最能代表共产主义思想的，最能代表马克思列宁主义思想的，就是我们伟大领袖毛主席的思想。只有大学大用毛泽东思想，才能反对各种各样的剥削阶级思想，修正主义思想。因此，我们党的思想建设工作，就是在全党大张旗鼓地进行毛泽东思想的教育，就是在党内大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，就是让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    经过这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底批判和肃清以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义思想影响，我们全党在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，将会更加坚强地团结起来。每个共产党员都要把学习毛泽东思想，当作生命的第一需要，读一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话，斗一辈子“私”字，批一辈子“修”字，干一辈子革命，做一辈子毛主席的好战士。要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！
