	China's sacred airspace will not tolerate American bandits running amok.
	The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement fully supporting our Ministry of National Defense's strong warning to the American imperialists.
	The *People's Liberation Army Daily* applauds the heroic Chinese People's Air Force for severely punishing the American bandit planes.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 19th — The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 18th, strongly condemning the recent actions of American imperialists who sent planes to repeatedly violate Chinese airspace, bombing and strafing Dongxing County of the Zhuang Autonomous Region and the southwestern border areas near Youyi Pass.

	The statement pointed out that for a long time, American planes have repeatedly strafed Chinese fishing boats and cargo ships, and attacked Chinese planes. Recently, American planes have again repeatedly violated Chinese airspace, bombing and strafing Dongxing County and Youyi Pass. This is a new and serious military provocation by the United States against the People's Republic of China.

	The statement said, "The aforementioned blatant actions prove that while the United States is plotting to intensify and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, it is also adopting a policy of provocation against the People's Republic of China. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the solemn position and strong warning issued by the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense on September 16th."

	The statement emphasized, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns the new military provocation by the United States government against the People's Republic of China."

	The statement said, "American imperialism is the common enemy of the Vietnamese people and the Chinese people. If it persists in its aggression against Vietnam and continues to violate Chinese airspace and bomb and strafe Chinese territory, the Vietnamese people, together with their Chinese brothers, will surely give it the punishment it deserves."

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 19th — The *People's Army Daily* of Vietnam published a commentary on the 19th, strongly condemning the recent military provocations by American imperialist planes that repeatedly violated Chinese airspace, attacked Chinese ships, and bombed and strafed Chinese territory. It enthusiastically applauded the heroic Chinese people for giving the American bandits the punishment they deserved.

	The commentary enthusiastically applauded the Chinese People's Air Force for bravely and promptly retaliating against and injuring the invading American bandit planes.

	The commentary pointed out that the airspace of Vietnam and China is not a place for American bandit planes to do as they please. Facing the great power of the people's war, the more the American imperialists persist in their old ways, the more they will meet their doom like moths flying into a flame.
