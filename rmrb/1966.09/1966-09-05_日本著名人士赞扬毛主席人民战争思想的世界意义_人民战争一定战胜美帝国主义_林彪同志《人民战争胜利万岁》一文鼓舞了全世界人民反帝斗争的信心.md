Japanese prominent figures have praised Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and its global significance, saying that people's war will definitely defeat American imperialism. Comrade Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War" has inspired the confidence of the world's people in their struggle against imperialism.

	New China News Agency, Tokyo, September 3rd - Japanese prominent figures from various circles spoke to Chinese reporters on the occasion of the first anniversary of Comrade Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War," saying that this article, which is permeated with Mao Zedong Thought, has greatly inspired the confidence of the world's people in their struggle against imperialism. They pointed out that Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is a new creative development of Marxism-Leninism and has great international significance.

	Japanese renowned military commentator Hayashi Ryosuke also said, "The article 'Long Live the Victory of People's War' fundamentally elucidates Chairman Mao Zedong's thought on people's war, enhancing the confidence of the people of various countries in defeating imperialism. Chairman Mao Zedong not only applied Marxism-Leninism to China and achieved success but also elucidated universal truths with global significance."

	Hayashi Ryosuke also pointed out, "'Long Live the Victory of People's War' indicates a strategic line that is completely suited to today's world situation. He said, "Now, not only are the contradictions between the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and imperialism becoming increasingly sharp, but some of these contradictions are also intertwined with internal contradictions within the United States. In order to attack China and suppress the liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries, the United States has established bases around China. At the same time, it is frantically seizing oil from the Middle East, uranium from the Congo, and resources from other regions. Therefore, to overthrow imperialism, the peoples of various countries must rise up and fight."

	Hayashi Ryosuke emphasized, "Chairman Mao Zedong's theory of people's war has made a correct judgment about the world situation: imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Whoever wants to annihilate the people will inevitably be annihilated themselves."

	Hayashi Ryosuke pointed out, "Relying solely on the peace movement cannot stop war; one must confront and struggle against the essence of imperialism and the root of war to eliminate war. This confrontation and struggle against imperialism is people's war. The Vietnamese people are currently waging such a war."

	Hayashi Ryosuke said, "Some people say that studying and supporting the views of this article is 'subservience.' These people deliberately do not see the essence of things and distort the essence of things."

	Takada Yutaka, known for his research on Chinese literature, said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought proves that people's war can defeat American imperialism."

	Takada Yutaka pointed out that based on Mao Zedong's theory of surrounding the cities from the countryside, Lin Biao proposed a new view on the world revolutionary strategy, that is, using the "world's countryside" of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to surround the "world's cities" of North America and Western Europe. Today, the people's revolutionary movement is vigorously developing from the "world's countryside" and surrounding the "world's cities." He said that the people's struggles in Vietnam, Angola, the Dominican Republic, and other places have all proven the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Takada Yutaka said, "Chairman Mao Zedong's thought on establishing revolutionary base areas has profound content and, in every sense, is a new development of Marxism-Leninism."

	Takada Yutaka said, "The article 'Long Live the Victory of People's War' points out that everything in the world can be divided. He said, 'American imperialism can also be divided and defeated. As long as the strategy and tactics of people's war are implemented, any powerful enemy can be divided and defeated.'"

	Takada Yutaka condemned the Khrushchev revisionists as traitors to people's war. He said, "The fundamental reason they have become traitors is that they have abandoned class struggle." He said, "The Khrushchev revisionists do not allow others to make revolution, and out of fear of American imperialism's nuclear blackmail, they are even willing to sacrifice the revolution of other countries."

	Japanese Socialist Party Diet member Hozumi Shichiro pointed out that the correctness and power of Chairman Mao Zedong's thought on people's war have long been proven by the practice and victory of China's War of Resistance Against Japan; after the end of World War II, it has also been verified by the surging national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are using this principle to wage creative struggles based on their own specific conditions, making the world's number one imperialist—American imperialism—fall into a dilemma.

	Hozumi Shichiro said, "In Japan, some people insist that waging people's armed struggle is 'militaristic,' which is completely wrong. Because the people's army wages war not to invade other nations but to fight against imperialist forces that obstruct national independence and national unity. In this sense, the people's army is an army that fights for peace."

    日本著名人士赞扬毛主席人民战争思想的世界意义
    人民战争一定战胜美帝国主义
    林彪同志《人民战争胜利万岁》一文鼓舞了全世界人民反帝斗争的信心
    新华社东京三日电　日本各界著名人士就林彪同志发表《人民战争胜利万岁》一周年向中国记者发表谈话说，这篇贯穿着毛泽东思想的文章，大大地鼓舞了全世界人民反帝斗争的信心。他们指出，毛主席关于人民战争的思想是对马克思列宁主义的一个新的创造性的发展，具有重大的国际意义。
    日本著名军事评论家林克也说，《人民战争胜利万岁》这篇文章，从根本上阐明了毛泽东主席的关于人民战争的思想，增强了各国人民战胜帝国主义的信心。毛泽东主席不仅把马克思列宁主义运用于中国，获得了成功，而且也阐明了具有全世界意义的普遍真理。
    林克也还指出，《人民战争胜利万岁》，表明了一条完全适合今天世界局势的战略路线。他说，现在，不仅是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民同帝国主义的矛盾日益激化，而且有些矛盾也同美国内部的矛盾交织在一起。美国为了进攻中国，镇压各国人民的解放斗争，在中国周围遍布基地，同时它又在拚命攫取中近东的石油、刚果的铀以及其他地区的资源。因此，要打倒帝国主义，各国人民就必须起来进行斗争。
    林克也强调说，毛泽东主席的人民战争理论，对世界形势作了一个正确判断：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，谁要想消灭人民，他自己就必然被灭亡。
    林克也指出，光靠和平运动，是不能阻止战争的；必须针对帝国主义的本质和战争的根源进行对抗和斗争，才能消灭战争。这种对帝国主义的对抗和斗争就是人民战争。现在越南人民正在进行着的就是这样的战争。
    林克也说，有人说什么研究和支持这篇论文的观点，就是“事大主义”，这些人是故意不看事物的本质，歪曲事物的本质。
    以研究中国文学著名的高畠穰说：“毛泽东思想是世界革命的指针。毛泽东思想证明，人民战争能够战胜美帝国主义。”
    高畠穰指出，林彪根据毛泽东关于农村包围城市的理论，对世界革命战略提出了一个新的看法，即用亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的
  “世界的农村”包围北美和西欧的“世界的城市”。今天人民革命运动正从“世界的农村”蓬勃地发展起来，包围着“世界的城市”。他说，越南、安哥拉、多米尼加等地的人民斗争，都证实了毛泽东思想的正确。
    高畠穰说：“毛泽东主席关于建立革命根据地的思想有着深刻的内容，它从各种意义上说，都是对马克思列宁主义的一个新的发展。”
    高畠穰说，《人民战争胜利万岁》一书中指出世界上的一切事物都是可以分割的这一论点，很重要。他说，“美帝国主义也是可以分割的，可以击败的。只要实行人民战争的战略战术，任何强大的敌人，都是可以分割和击败的。”
    高畠穰谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是人民战争的叛徒。他说，“他们所以堕落为叛徒，最根本的一条是抛弃了阶级斗争。”他说，“赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不许别人闹革命，而且由于害怕美帝国主义的核讹诈，甚至不惜牺牲别国的革命。”
    日本社会党国会议员穗积七郎指出，毛泽东主席关于人民战争的思想的正确性和威力，早已为中国人民的抗日战争的实践和胜利所证明；在第二次世界大战结束以后，又为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各地的汹涌澎湃的民族解放斗争的发展所证实。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民正在根据他们各自的具体条件运用这个原理进行创造性的斗争，使世界的头号帝国主义——美帝国主义陷入了困境。
    穗积七郎说，在日本有人硬说进行人民的武装斗争是什么“好战”，这是完全错误的。因为，人民的军队进行战争不是为了侵略别的民族，而是为了同阻挠民族独立和民族统一的帝国主义侵略势力进行斗争，从这个意义上来说，人民的军队是为和平而战的军队。
