The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) has issued a call to seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's two important works, "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." These works have great significance for the Australian communist movement.

	New China News Agency, September 13th: Melbourne News: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) organ, "Australian Communist," published an article in its August issue calling on Australian Marxist-Leninists to seriously study Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction."

	The article states that these two works are "the most profound and systematic exposition of dialectical materialism," and that they "have not only had a profound impact in China but also around the world, illuminating people's minds."

	The article states that the experience of the Australian communist movement needs to be continually summarized, especially the experience of "ideologically, politically, and organizationally breaking with revisionism." Therefore, deeply studying Chairman Mao's two works is of great significance.

	The article states that the study of these two works "should not be intermittent but must be continuous, and they must be applied to practice."

	The article states that the conclusions drawn from investigations and research on the specific situation in Australia always demonstrate the universal significance of the laws expounded by Mao Zedong.
