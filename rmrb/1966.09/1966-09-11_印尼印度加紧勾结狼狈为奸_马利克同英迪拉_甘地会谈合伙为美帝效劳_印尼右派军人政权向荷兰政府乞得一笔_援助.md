Indonesia and India are intensifying their collaboration in a shameful alliance. Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik held talks with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Foreign Minister Swaran Singh from September 3 to 7, discussing how to jointly serve U.S. imperialism and anti-China policies.

During his talks with Indira Gandhi and Singh, Malik discussed the situation in Southeast Asia and particularly the situation in Vietnam. According to the Indian news agency PTI, Malik and Singh found that their views on many issues discussed were consistent. "Indonesia's stance on the Vietnam issue is essentially the same as India's."

In a statement issued at the end of his visit, Malik made it clear that the Indian reactionary government and the Indonesian right-wing are openly serving U.S. imperialism's "peace talks" conspiracy in Vietnam. The statement declared that both sides believe that "every effort should be made" to resolve the Vietnam issue "through negotiations within the shortest possible time," and advocated using a "cessation of bombing" to lead to the start of negotiations.

After his talks with Indira Gandhi and Singh, Malik held a press conference where he viciously attacked China. He slandered China for "interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs" and, despite the fact that Indonesian right-wing forces were frenziedly anti-China and anti-Indonesian, he falsely claimed that Indonesia's "goodwill" towards China had not been reciprocated. Indian reactionary newspapers seized the opportunity to slander China for "aggressing" against India.

The Indonesian right-wing and Indian reactionaries also mutually praised each other and boosted each other's morale. Malik openly supported the Indian reactionaries, advocating for the resolution of the Kashmir issue according to the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy product, the pro-Indian "Tashkent Declaration." Singh welcomed the Indonesian right-wing military regime's public alignment with the U.S. imperialist line, openly merging with the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia" to fight against communism, and welcomed its preparation to rejoin the United Nations under U.S. control.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on September 8, The Hague: The Indonesian right-wing military regime recently held a ministerial-level meeting with the Dutch colonial authorities, who had ruled Indonesia for 150 years. On September 8, they signed an agreement in The Hague to "strengthen economic and cultural relations between the two countries." This agreement stipulates that the Indonesian right-wing military regime agrees to repay the Dutch 6 billion guilders (approximately 60 million pounds) in debt and will immediately use the 360 million guilders that have been frozen since 1965 as the first installment of the debt repayment.

As part of this agreement, the Dutch government expressed its willingness to provide Indonesia with 610 million guilders in "aid" in the form of grants, loans, and bank credits.

    印尼右派军人政权向荷兰政府乞得一笔“援助”
    据新华社八日讯　新德里消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权同印度反动政府正在日益加紧勾结。印度尼西亚外交部长马利克在三日至七日到印度同印度总理英迪拉·甘地、外交部长辛格等就共同为美帝国主义效劳和反华等问题进行了商谈。
    马利克在同英迪拉·甘地、辛格的会谈中，讨论了东南亚局势、“特别讨论了越南局势。”据印度报业托辣斯报道，马利克和辛格“对会谈中提起的许多问题的观点一致”，“印度尼西亚对越南问题的态度实际上与印度的态度一样”。
    马利克在访问结束时发表的一项公报，表明印度反动政府和印度尼西亚右派公开为美帝国主义在越南问题上的
  “和谈”阴谋效劳。公报叫嚷，双方认为，应当“继续尽一切努力”使越南问题“在最短不过的时间内通过谈判达到和平解决”，并且鼓吹以“停止轰炸”来导致开始谈判。
    马利克在同英迪拉·甘地、辛格会谈后举行的记者招待会上恶毒地反华。他诬蔑中国“干涉印度尼西亚的内政”，并且不顾印度尼西亚右派势力疯狂地反华、排华，蓄意破坏中国同印度尼西亚两国关系的事实，胡说什么印度尼西亚对中国的“善意”没有得到回答。印度反动报纸也趁机大肆诽谤中国“侵略”印度。
    印度尼西亚右派和印度反动派还互相大肆吹捧、互相打气。马利克公开支持印度反动派，主张按照美苏合谋的产物、偏袒印度的“塔什干宣言”来解决克什米尔问题。辛格表示欢迎印度尼西亚右派军人政权按照美帝国主义的意旨，公开同新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”合流反共，欢迎它准备重新加入美国控制下的联合国。
    据新华社八日讯　海牙消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权与曾经统治印度尼西亚达一百五十年之久的荷兰殖民当局最近举行双方部长级会谈，八日在海牙签订了一个“密切两国经济和文化关系”的协定。这项协定规定，印尼右派军人政权同意偿还荷兰六亿荷盾（约六千万英镑）的债务，并且将立即动用自一九六五年以来被冻结的三千六百万荷盾作为首批偿还债务的钱。
    作为这个协定的一部分，荷兰政府表示它愿意以赠款、贷款和银行信贷的形式给予印度尼西亚以六千一百万荷盾的“援助”。
