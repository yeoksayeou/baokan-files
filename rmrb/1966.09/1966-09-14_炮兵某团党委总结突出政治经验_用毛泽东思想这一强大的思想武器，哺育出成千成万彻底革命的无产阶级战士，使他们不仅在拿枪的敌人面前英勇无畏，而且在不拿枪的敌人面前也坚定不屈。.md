The Artillery Unit Party Committee of the Lanzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army has summarized its experience in emphasizing politics. They believe that the fundamental issue in ensuring that the Party Committee's leadership consistently emphasizes politics is to follow Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, to clearly establish a class and class struggle perspective, and to intensively reform the worldview of Party Committee members. Only by never forgetting class struggle can one truly understand the great strategic significance of Comrade Lin Biao's five principles of emphasizing politics, and thereby firmly and unshakably emphasize politics in all work, using victories on the ideological front to guarantee victories on the material front.

Two years ago, the work of this unit was relatively backward. After the new Party Committee was established, the members decided to turn things around and catch up with their sister units. They studied Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing politics and decided to focus on emphasizing politics to change the face of the unit. However, when it came to actual work, they often deviated from this focus. Why did "emphasizing politics" seem clear in theory but get lost in practice? Initially, some thought it was due to poor work arrangements or rushing to complete certain tasks. Many disagreed with this view, pointing out: In the past, during wartime, the focus was always on class education, with little time for military training, yet the unit still won battles. Was this also due to poor work arrangements?

They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle and finally realized: Not emphasizing politics is forgetting class struggle, forgetting the fundamental principle of building the people's army through politics. In the past, during wartime, facing real guns and cannons, commanders actively and proactively focused on raising class consciousness, inspiring the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to display bravery and fearlessness in battle, daring to defeat any powerful enemy. After national liberation, dealing with training and production every day, not hearing gunfire or seeing oppression, over time, the consciousness of class struggle gradually faded. Therefore, when it came to achieving results by emphasizing politics, they often only thought of hitting the target with shells or exceeding production quotas, unconsciously turning political primacy into training primacy, production primacy.

Through discussing facts and reasoning, they deeply felt: To prevent work from deviating, one must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, remember class struggle, and remember to emphasize politics. To fulfill the historical mission of the Chinese and world revolution, one must persistently use Mao Zedong Thought as a powerful ideological weapon to nurture tens of thousands of thorough revolutionaries, making them not only fearless in the face of armed enemies but also unyielding in the face of unarmed enemies.

How can one consistently emphasize politics? In the past, when work deviated from politics, some grassroots cadres criticized, "The root is crooked, the branches are bent. Work deviated because Party Committee members had selfish thoughts." Some Party Committee members heard this and were not convinced. Later, they restudied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing politics, specifically analyzing the guiding thoughts before and after several deviations, and finally realized that their work motives were mixed with selfish thoughts: To quickly complete production tasks and report to superiors, they only focused on the progress of digging canals and the number of acres plowed; fearing that shooting scores would lag behind sister units and be disgraced, they only focused on technical training. They also used many examples to illustrate: Once selfish thoughts gain the upper hand, they only focus on visible things, on work that shows immediate results and receives praise, emphasizing their own responsibilities to an inappropriate extent, thus deviating from politics. They deeply felt: Selfish thoughts are the root of deviating from politics. One must consciously and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, daring to use Mao Zedong Thought as a bayonet and hand grenade to fight "close combat" against selfish thoughts in one's mind. Only by overcoming the "self" can one guard the gate of emphasizing politics.

Over the past year, the Party Committee members of this unit, on the one hand, have studied Chairman Mao's works with the questions of "for whom to work" and "for whom to revolutionize" in mind, constantly waging a struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology in their minds; on the other hand, they have practically implemented emphasizing politics at the grassroots level. During their visits to the grassroots, they focused on emphasizing politics, helping with emphasizing politics, and summarizing and promoting experiences of emphasizing politics.

This unit, by emphasizing politics everywhere, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's souls and promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, has won a victory on the ideological front. Consequently, over the past year, it has achieved remarkable results in the construction of revolutionization and militarization, excellently completing various tasks such as military training and agricultural and sideline production, and also winning a great victory on the material front.

    炮兵某团党委总结突出政治经验
    用毛泽东思想这一强大的思想武器，哺育出成千成万彻底革命的无产阶级战士，使他们不仅在拿枪的敌人面前英勇无畏，而且在不拿枪的敌人面前也坚定不屈。
    据新华社兰州十三日电　党委的领导怎样才能坚持突出政治永不转向？人民解放军兰州部队炮兵某团党委认为：根本问题在于遵照毛主席关于政治就是阶级对阶级的斗争的教导，明确树立阶级和阶级斗争观点，狠抓党委成员世界观的改造。只有念念不忘阶级斗争，才能真正认识到林彪副主席突出政治五项原则的伟大战略意义，从而坚定不移地在一切工作中突出政治，用精神战线上的胜利，保证物质战线上的胜利。
    这个团在两年前工作还比较后进。新的党委班子组成后，委员们决心打个翻身仗，赶上兄弟团。他们学习了林彪副主席关于突出政治的指示，决定大抓突出政治，改变部队面貌，可是一到实际工作中却往往转向。为什么“突出政治一学就通，一做就冲”？开始有人认为是工作安排不当的结果，是急于做好某项工作发生的偏差。许多人不同意这种看法，指出：过去在战争年代带兵，总是首先抓阶级教育，没有多少时间搞军事训练，部队却不断打胜仗，这难道也是工作安排问题吗？
    他们带着这个问题学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，终于认识到：不突出政治，就是忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了人民军队政治建军的根本。在过去战争年代，面对着真枪实弹的阶级斗争，带兵的干部就积极主动地去抓提高人的阶级觉悟的工作，激励广大指战员在战斗中发扬勇敢、不怕死的精神，敢于战胜任何强大的敌人。在全国解放以后，成天跟训练、生产打交道，听不到枪声炮声，看不见剥削压迫，日久天长，阶级斗争观念逐渐淡薄了。所以一提到突出政治出成果，往往只想到炮弹进圈圈，生产超指标，不自觉地把政治第一变成了训练第一，生产第一。
    通过摆事实、讲道理，他们深深体会到：要使工作不转向，就要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢记阶级斗争，牢记突出政治。为了担负起中国革命和世界革命历史使命的需要，必须坚持不懈地用毛泽东思想这一强大的思想武器，哺育出成千成万彻底革命的无产阶级战士，使他们不仅在拿枪的敌人面前英勇无畏，而且在不拿枪的敌人面前也坚定不屈。
    怎样才能坚定不移地突出政治？
    过去工作中发生冲击政治的苗头时，有的基层干部批评说：“根根不正，梢梢歪。工作转了向，是因为党委成员有私心杂念造成的。”有的党委委员听了，还不服气。后来，他们重新学习了“老三篇”和林彪副主席关于突出政治的指示，具体分析了几次转向前后的指导思想，才认识到自己的工作动机里掺有私心杂念：为了迅速完成生产任务，向领导上“交账”，就只注意了挖渠进度，耕地亩数；怕打靶成绩落在兄弟团后边不光彩，就只注意了抓技术训练。大家还用许多事例说明：私心杂念一占上风，就只注意抓看得见的东西，抓容易见成效、受表扬的工作，把个人所担负的一部分工作强调到不适当的地位，从而冲击了政治。他们深有感触地说：私心杂念是冲击政治的祸根。必须自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，敢于把毛泽东思想当作刺刀、手榴弹，和头脑里的私心杂念打“近战”。只有斗倒“我”字，才能把好突出政治的关。
    一年多来，这个团党委的成员一方面带着为谁工作、为谁革命等问题努力学习毛主席著作，在自己头脑里不断开展灭资兴无的斗争；另一方面踏踏实实地把突出政治落实到基层。在蹲点中，他们看的是突出政治，帮的是突出政治，总结、推广的也是突出政治的经验。
    这个团由于处处突出政治，用毛泽东思想去改造人的灵魂，促进人的思想革命化，在精神战线上打了胜仗，因而一年来在革命化、战斗化建设中取得显著成绩，出色地完成了军事训练和农副业生产等各项任务，在物质战线上也打了一个大胜仗。
