A delegation from the University Students' Committee of the France-China Friendship Association, which had recently returned from a visit to China, screened slides introducing China's socialist construction, people's lives, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at a gala evening of the International University Students' Cultural Festival in Paris on September 20. The slides aroused great interest among the audience.

The screening of these slides was only made possible after overcoming the unreasonable obstruction by anti-China elements and with the enthusiastic support of the audience.

Many audience members came to the gala evening with a keen desire to learn about New China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, certain anti-China elements, fearing that the masses would learn the truth about China, abused their authority as hosts of the evening's event, arbitrarily arranged "programs," created disturbances, and occupied the stage in an attempt to cancel the delegation's program. Their disruptive activities aroused great indignation among the audience, and the struggle continued until late at night. Those troublemakers were completely isolated in the audience and finally had to slip away. The hall then immediately returned to calm, and the audience took their seats again. Although it was already very late, everyone's spirits remained high, and they persevered to watch the slides and listen to the report on their visit to China.

When the screening of the slides and the report ended, the entire audience burst into enthusiastic applause.

    介绍中国文化大革命的幻灯片在巴黎放映受到观众热烈欢迎
    某些反华分子进行捣乱引起观众极大愤慨
    新华社巴黎二十二日电　最近刚访问中国回国的法中友好协会大学生委员会代表团，二十日在巴黎国际大学生文化联欢节的晚会上，放映了介绍中国社会主义建设和人民生活，介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的幻灯片，引起观众极大的兴趣。
    这些幻灯片是在排除了反华分子的无理阻挠和在观众的热烈支持下才能在晚会上放映的。
    很多观众怀着迫切了解新中国，了解中国文化大革命的心情来参加晚会。但是某些反华分子害怕群众了解中国的真相，滥用主持当天晚会的权力，故意临时安排“节目”，无理取闹，占据舞台，企图挤掉访华代表团的节目。他们的捣乱活动激起了观众极大的愤慨，斗争一直持续到深夜，那些捣乱的家伙在观众中完全陷于孤立，最后只得溜走。这时场内立刻恢复平静，观众都回到座位上。虽然已经很晚，大家的情绪始终饱满，坚持看了幻灯片和听访问中国见闻的报告。
    放映幻灯和报告结束时，全场观众热烈鼓掌。
