	Chairman Mao said: “The current era is one where capitalism and imperialism worldwide are heading towards their doom, and socialism and people’s democracy worldwide are marching towards victory.” “All the people of the world must have the courage to fight, dare to face difficulties, and advance fearlessly. Only then will the world belong to the people. All demons will be vanquished.”

	The current global revolutionary situation is excellent. The people of the world must establish the broadest international united front against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and carry the struggle against imperialism and revisionism through to the end. The revolutionary people of the world, following Chairman Mao’s teachings, mastering and applying Mao Zedong Thought, uniting and fighting together, will certainly win the entire world. The dawn is just ahead; we must strive for it! (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    迎着新时代的曙光前进
    毛主席说：“现在是全世界资本主义和帝国主义走向灭亡，全世界社会主义和人民民主主义走向胜利的历史时代”。“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    当前的世界革命形势好得很。全世界人民必须建立反对美帝国主义及其走狗的最广泛的国际统一战线，把反帝反修的斗争进行到底。全世界革命人民遵循毛主席的教导，掌握和运用毛泽东思想，团结战斗，一定能够赢得整个世界。曙光就在前面，我们应当努力！　（据新华社）
