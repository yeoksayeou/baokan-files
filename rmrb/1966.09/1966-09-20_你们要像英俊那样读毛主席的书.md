	You must learn from Chairman Mao's book like Yingjun.
	Great communist warrior Liu Yingjun's mother, Zhu Xiulan

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the spirit of the Red Guards who dare to think, dare to break through, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel has deeply moved me and made me very happy from the bottom of my heart. You are right, and you have done well. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, wholeheartedly support you and firmly support you!

	Recently, many Red Guards have come to Changchun from all over the country to exchange revolutionary experiences, and they have also come to visit me, giving me the red armbands of the Red Guards. I feel extremely happy and honored. Remembering the old society where people were eaten, I hate it a thousand times, ten thousand times. Those capitalist and landlord wolves did not treat us workers and poor and lower-middle peasants as human beings. They treated us like cattle and horses, broke our backs, and sucked our blood. It was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved us poor people from suffering and made us masters of the state, with our lives getting better day by day. Reflecting on the bitterness and sweetness, I love the new society even more, and I love the Communist Party and Chairman Mao even more. I want to shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

	Those capitalist and landlord wolves, as well as the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated our revolutionary ranks, hate the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, hate us workers and poor and lower-middle peasants ruling the country. They are not willing to accept their own destruction and always want to seize the opportunity to conspire to restore the old order. We will never allow them to do so. We must launch a fierce attack on them, rebel against them, and overthrow them.

	Red Guards, the enemy is very cunning, and the struggle is very complicated. To achieve a thorough victory in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you must respond to Chairman Mao's call, humbly learn from the People's Liberation Army, and resolutely take the People's Liberation Army as an example. You must learn from the People's Liberation Army to study and apply Chairman Mao's works; you must be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people like the People's Liberation Army; you must stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint and distinguish between enemies and ourselves like the People's Liberation Army. My son Yingjun was able to become a communist warrior because he firmly responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, studied Mao Zedong Thought diligently, implemented Mao Zedong Thought resolutely, actively propagated Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defended Mao Zedong Thought, and guided all his actions with Mao Zedong Thought.

	Red Guards, to be good Red Guards of Chairman Mao, the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and do as Chairman Mao says. Currently, you must study and apply the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao. It is the program of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the guide for the revolutionary masses to unite in thought and action. You must take up this sharp weapon of the "Sixteen Points" to solve the actual problems in your region and unit. Whatever is in accordance with the "Sixteen Points," you must carry it out resolutely; whatever is not in accordance with the "Sixteen Points," you must correct it resolutely.

	Chairman Mao said: "The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you." Red Guards, you must not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for you. You must bravely learn revolutionary skills in the great storms of revolutionary struggle, forge yourselves into good soldiers and students of Chairman Mao, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, build our great socialist motherland into an iron fortress, and fulfill the glorious mission and historical responsibility entrusted to you by the people of our motherland and the revolutionary people of the world!

    你们要像英俊那样读毛主席的书
    伟大的共产主义战士刘英俊的妈妈　朱秀兰
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵敢想、敢闯、敢于革命、敢于造反的精神，使我深受感动，打心眼里高兴。你们做得对，干得好。我们广大贫下中农举双手赞成，坚决支持你们！
    最近，有许多红卫兵，不辞辛苦，从祖国各地来到长春交流革命经验，还来看望我，给我带上了红卫兵的红袖章，我感到无比幸福和光荣。回忆起吃人的旧社会，我一千个恨，一万个恨。那些资本家、地主豺狼们，根本不把我们工人、贫下中农当人看待。他们拿咱们当牛做马，压折了咱们的脊梁，吸尽了咱们的血。是党和毛主席把我们穷苦人从苦难中救出来，做了国家的主人，生活一天天好起来。忆苦思甜，使我更加热爱新社会，更加热爱共产党和毛主席。我要千声万声高呼：中国共产党万岁！我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    那些资产阶级、地主狗豺狼，以及钻到我们革命队伍里的资产阶级代表人物，仇恨共产党和毛主席，仇恨我们工人和贫下中农坐天下，他们不甘心自己的灭亡，总想伺机阴谋复辟。我们决不允许他们这样做，要向他们发起猛攻，造他们的反，革他们的命。
    红卫兵小将们，敌人是很狡猾的，斗争是很复杂的。要取得这场史无前例的文化大革命的彻底胜利，你们一定要响应毛主席的号召，虚心向解放军学习，坚决以解放军为榜样。要像解放军那样，活学活用毛主席著作；要像解放军那样，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民；要像解放军那样，站稳无产阶级立场，分清敌我。我的儿子英俊能够成为一名共产主义战士，就是由于他坚决地响应林彪同志的号召，努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，积极宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想指导自己的一切行动。
    红卫兵小将们，你们要当好毛主席的红卫兵，最根本的一条，就是要活学活用毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，毛主席怎么说，你们就怎么做。从当前来说，就要认真地学好用好毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条。它是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领，是革命群众统一认识、统一行动的指南。你们要拿起十六条这个锐利武器，用来解决本地区、本单位的实际问题，凡是合十六条的，就坚决照办，不合十六条的，就坚决改正。
    毛主席说：“世界是属于你们的。中国的前途是属于你们的。”红卫兵小将们，你们一定不要辜负毛主席对你们的希望，你们要勇敢地在革命斗争的大风大浪中，学会革命的本领，把自己锻炼成为毛主席的好战士、好学生，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把我们伟大的社会主义祖国建成铁打的江山，完成祖国人民和世界革命人民赋予你们的光荣任务和历史使命！
