Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, on August 31, received 500,000 Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country and the capital at Tiananmen Square.

This was the rally to advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the rally to spread the spark of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The magnificent Tiananmen Square was filled from noon with revolutionary students from all over the country and some revolutionary students from the capital. They came here to be inspected by the great leader and to take the revolutionary spark from here to spread the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to every corner of the country.

At 5:40 PM, Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform, and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, arrived in an open-top car among the vast Red Guards and revolutionary students. Other central leaders also arrived in open-top cars following behind. The entire square immediately erupted in excitement.

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" The cheers echoed through the sky.

At this joyous moment, waves of happiness rolled over every corner of the square. Millions of eyes, filled with tears of joy, looked up at Chairman Mao. Millions of hearts beat in unison with Chairman Mao. Millions of arms were raised high in salute to Chairman Mao.

The Red Guards lined up on the east side of the Golden Water Bridge were the first to see Chairman Mao. They excitedly raised their copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Today, they felt more fortunate than anyone else because they were the Red Guards at Tiananmen Square who saw Chairman Mao the earliest and most clearly.

Chairman Mao's open-top car had already passed by, but the Red Guards continued to jump and shout excitedly. A Red Guard, as if suddenly remembering something very important, tightly grasped the hands of a PLA soldier and asked, "Uncle, quickly tell me, what time is it now?" The PLA soldier quickly understood his meaning, seriously looked at his watch, and replied, "5:40 PM!"

"5:40 PM!"

"5:40 PM!"

This precious moment was quickly written in the diaries of the Red Guards and etched in their hearts. They all regarded this moment as the happiest moment of their lives!

One Red Guard wrote a letter to his parents on the spot: "Quickly record this happy moment! It was at this happy moment that Chairman Mao inspected us, the little Red Guards who came to Beijing, and also inspected you, the old Red Guards at home!"

One Red Guard wrote in a letter to his comrades: "We must never forget this happy moment. We will carry on the spirit of daring to do, daring to venture, daring to make revolution, and daring to rebel. We will bravely take up the iron broom and sweep away all the monsters and demons, both open and hidden, thoroughly!"

The Red Guards from Beijing's August 1st School set out from the western suburbs at 7 AM to Tiananmen Square. They were all children of revolutionary soldiers. As they walked, they thought: We will definitely see Chairman Mao! When Chairman Mao's car passed by them, many students, in order to maintain order, did not get a good look at Chairman Mao. They shouted desperately, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! We want to see Chairman Mao again! We want to see Chairman Mao again!" Some Red Guards pulled the reporter and said, "Please quickly find a way for us to see Chairman Mao again! We wish we had wings to fly to Chairman Mao's side."

At 6:30 PM, our great leader Chairman Mao ascended the Tiananmen Rostrum, and the entire audience erupted in joy, shouting in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao forever!" Two Red Guards presented Chairman Mao with a red scarf and a Red Guard armband. The armband read: "Presented to: Chairman Mao—Our most beloved Red Commander. Your little red soldiers." Chairman Mao shook hands with them affectionately. They stood close to Chairman Mao. The great leader's heart was connected with the hearts of the revolutionary youngsters.

Chairman Mao's reception, Comrade Lin Biao's and Comrade Zhou Enlai's speeches, brought great encouragement to the Red Guards and revolutionary students. Listen to the bold words of the Red Guard youngsters:

"We will definitely, as Chairman Mao teaches, take up the revolutionary iron broom and sweep, inch by inch, day by day, in Beijing, throughout China, and throughout the world, to sweep away all monsters and demons, and let the bright red sun shine over the globe!"

"We are the Red Guards who defend Mao Zedong Thought. We listen most to Chairman Mao's words. We most resolutely implement the Sixteen Points and most bravely defend the Sixteen Points!"

"We are pioneers and vanguards, but we will never detach ourselves from the broad masses. We will learn the Three-Eight Style of the PLA and observe the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention."

"We not only dare to make revolution but also know how to make revolution!"

"We will use ideological struggle, not physical struggle, and we will not beat people."

Revolutionary students from all over the country, after being inspected by Chairman Mao and influenced by the cultural revolution storm in Beijing, saw that the Red Guards in Beijing had created a good situation for cultural revolution in just a few days. They were even more confident and determined to return to their hometowns to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A middle school student from Shandong said, "The entire city of Beijing is filled with revolutionary spirit. Coming to Beijing is especially exhilarating! We came to learn the spirit of proletarian rebellion, and we will rebel when we return."

A university student from Wuhan, seeing the spirit of destroying the old and establishing the new in Beijing, expressed his determination to learn from the revolutionary students in Beijing and to make this great revolution, from culture to politics and economics, develop in depth and thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism.

A student from a half-work, half-study technical school in Hebei said, "The revolutionary atmosphere in Beijing is really good. It made me get rid of the word 'fear' and gain the word 'venture.' I am determined to fight to the end with all monsters and demons when I return!"

The spirit of Red Guards and revolutionary students from various places, who traveled thousands of miles and endured hardships to come to Beijing to learn revolutionary experience, also inspired the Red Guards and revolutionary students in Beijing. Students from the new Peking University said, "We will learn from their spirit of spreading revolutionary seeds. We grew up by Chairman Mao's side and must carry out this great revolution well."

Mima Qangjue, a Tibetan student of serf origin from the Central Institute for Nationalities, said, "The liberation of a hundred million serfs is our first liberation. Participating in this cultural revolution is our second liberation. We must study Chairman Mao's works well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will temper ourselves in the great winds and waves and will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations. We will definitely bring this flame of revolution to Tibet and spread it throughout the country."

At night, Tiananmen Square was brightly lit. The spark of revolution was ignited here. Revolutionary students from various places and the capital were immersed in joy. They encouraged and congratulated each other on this happy meeting. Their emotions were stirred, and their revolutionary enthusiasm was burning! Revolutionary students from outside the capital were eager to return home. Some boarded trains that very night, taking the great leader's care and the instructions of the central leaders back home, taking the spark of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution back home, and taking the revolutionary spirit of the capital's youth back home.

    把革命的火种带到全国去
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，八月三十一日，在天安门接见了来自全国各地和首都的五十万红卫兵和革命师生。
    这是推动无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的誓师大会，是传播无产阶级文化大革命火种的大会。
    雄伟的天安门广场，从中午开始，就聚满了从各地来到北京的革命师生，以及首都部分革命师生的队伍。他们要在这里接受伟大领袖的检阅，要从这里接过革命的火种，把无产阶级文化大革命的烈火烧到全国每一个角落去。
    五点四十分，毛主席身着草绿色布军装，和他亲密的战友林彪同志，乘着敞篷汽车，来到了广大红卫兵和革命师生中间。中央其他领导同志，也乘敞篷汽车，跟在后面。整个广场立刻沸腾起来。
    “毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，响彻云霄。
    在这幸福的时刻，欢乐的波浪滚过广场的每一个角落。千万双眼睛含着喜悦的热泪仰望着毛主席。千万颗心追随着毛主席跳动。千万只手臂高高举起向着毛主席致敬。
    排列在金水桥东侧的红卫兵最先见到毛主席。他们激动地高举手中的《毛主席语录》，欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”今天，他们感到比任何人都幸福，因为他们是天安门广场上最早、最清楚地看到毛主席的红卫兵。
    毛主席乘坐的敞篷汽车已经过去了，红卫兵们还在一个劲地跳跃，一个劲地欢呼。一个红卫兵像突然想起一件很重要的事一样，紧紧握住一个解放军战士的双手问道：“叔叔，快告诉我，现在是什么时间。”解放军战士很快地领会了他的意思，认真地看了一下手表，回答说：“五点四十分！”
    “五点四十分！”
    “五点四十分！”
    这个宝贵的时刻很快地被红卫兵战士写在日记本上，记在心坎上。他们都把这个时刻当作自己一生中最最幸福的时刻！
    有个红卫兵当场写信给自己父母说：“快把这个幸福的时刻记下来吧！就是在这幸福的时刻里，毛主席检阅了我们来到北京的小红卫兵，也就是检阅了你们在家里的老红卫兵！”
    有个红卫兵在写给自己同志的信中说：“我们一定要永远不忘记这个幸福的时刻，发扬敢干、敢闯、敢革命、敢造反的精神，勇敢地拿起铁扫帚，把一切公开的、暗藏的牛鬼蛇神打扫个一干二净！”
    北京八一学校的红卫兵，早上七点就从西郊动身来天安门广场。他们都是革命军人的子女。他们一路走，一路想：我们一定会见到毛主席！当毛主席乘坐的汽车走过他们身边，许多同学为了维持秩序，没有仔细看看毛主席。他们拚命地喊呀喊呀：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！我们要再见见毛主席！我们要再见见毛主席！”有的红卫兵拉着记者说：“请你快想办法给我们说说，我们要再见见毛主席！我们恨不得长上一双翅膀，飞向毛主席的身边。”
    六时半，我们伟大的领袖毛主席走上天安门主席台，全场欢腾，齐声欢呼毛主席万寿无疆。两名红卫兵向毛主席献上红领巾和红卫兵袖章。袖章上写着：“献给：毛主席——我们最最敬爱的红司令。您的红小兵。”毛主席同她们亲切地握手。她们紧靠在毛主席身边。伟大领袖的心和革命小将的心连在一起。
    毛主席的接见，林彪同志和周恩来同志的讲话，给红卫兵和革命师生带来极大的鼓舞。请听听红卫兵小将们的豪言壮语吧：
    “我们一定要像毛主席教导的那样，拿起革命的铁扫帚，在北京、在全中国、在全世界，一寸一寸地扫，一天一天地扫，把一切牛鬼蛇神都扫光，让鲜红的太阳照遍全球！”
    “我们是捍卫毛泽东思想的红卫兵，我们最听毛主席的话，我们最坚决地执行十六条，最勇敢地捍卫十六条！”
    “我们是闯将，是先锋，但决不脱离广大群众。我们要学习解放军的三八作风，遵守三大纪律八项注意。”
    “我们不但要敢于革命，而且要善于革命！”
    “我们要用文斗，不用武斗，决不打人。”
    来自全国各地的革命师生，受到毛主席的检阅，受到北京文化大革命风暴的熏陶，看到北京的红卫兵们在几天内闯出了一派文化革命的大好形势，更加信心百倍，下决心回到本地去，大搞无产阶级文化革命。
    来自山东的一个中学生说：“整个北京城一片革命气氛。来到北京，特别痛快！我们是来学习无产阶级的造反精神的，回去以后就造反。”
    来自武汉的一个大学生，看到北京破旧立新的革命精神，表示要向北京革命师生学习，使这场大革命从文化到政治、经济，向纵深发展，彻底挖掉修正主义老根。
    河北一所半工半读技术学校的同学说：“北京的革命空气实在好，使我丢掉了个‘怕’字，得到了个‘闯’字，回去决心同一切牛鬼蛇神斗到底！”
    各地红卫兵和革命师生不远千里，不辞辛劳到北京学习革命经验的精神，也鼓舞了北京的红卫兵和革命师生。新北大的同学说：“我们要学习他们这种传播革命种子的精神。我们成长在毛主席的身边，更要把这场伟大革命搞好。”
    中央民族学院农奴出身的藏族学生米玛昌觉说：“百万农奴站起来，是我们的第一次解放，参加这场文化大革命，是我们的第二次解放。我们一定要好好学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，在大风大浪里锻炼成长，决不辜负毛主席对我们的期望。我们一定要把这把革命的烈火带到西藏，燃遍全国。”
    入夜，天安门广场上万灯齐明。革命的火种在这里点燃。各地革命师生和首都革命师生沉浸在一片欢腾中。他们互相鼓励着，祝贺着这幸福的会见。他们的心情激动，革命热情在燃烧！外地来的革命师生归心似箭，有的当夜就乘上火车，把伟大领袖的关怀和中央首长的指示带回去，把无产阶级文化大革命的火种带回去，把首都青少年的革命闯劲带回去。
