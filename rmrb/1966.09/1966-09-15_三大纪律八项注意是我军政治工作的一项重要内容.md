The Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention are an important part of our military's political work.

Li Guohui (Cook, Team Secretary for Mass Work): The team secretary assigned me to handle mass work. Initially, I thought that doing mass work and checking on the discipline of the masses was just a lot of trivial, nagging tasks. I didn't have the time for these bothersome things. Deputy Political Instructor Hu Tongfu saw through my thoughts and had a talk with me. He first told me a story about suppressing bandits in the Dabie Mountains: In July 1949, our company was ordered to annihilate a band of remnants hiding in the Dabie Mountains. Initially, we only used military suppression, often missing our targets. Later, we strengthened our political offensive, implementing a combination of military and political suppression. The troops, led by cadres, dispersed to live in various villages, doing mass work and carrying out activities to benefit the people. We explained to the masses our military's Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention, policies on treating prisoners of war kindly, and helped the villagers with tasks like cutting grass, fetching water, grinding grain, and farming. While working, we also propagated our ideas. During disaster relief, we shared our rations to aid the impoverished. Because we gained the trust of the masses, they took action, voluntarily reporting bandit activities and the hiding places of bandit weapons to our military. They also launched a mass psychological warfare campaign. With the help of the broad masses, we combined military strikes with political disintegration, quickly achieving a great victory in annihilating the remnants in the Dabie Mountains.

After telling this story, Deputy Political Instructor explained to me the crucial role this fundamental discipline plays in uniting our military, uniting the masses, defeating the enemy, and ensuring our combat effectiveness. This made me realize that implementing the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention is an indispensable part of our military's political work. Throughout the entire history of our military's construction and in all aspects, it has played a tremendous role. In the early days of the Red Army, by strictly implementing the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention and a series of political work systems, our military effectively eliminated all the bad influences of the old army, thus building a completely new type of people's army. In the long-term struggle against the enemy, because our military thoroughly implemented the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention, our combat effectiveness rapidly improved, effectively undermining the enemy's morale. Each point of the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention is filled with political content and is a specific embodiment of the Party's line and policies. Doing mass work and checking on the discipline of the masses, although dealing with small matters, contains significant substance. In the future, I will take the implementation of the Three Main Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention as a political task, further understand and master them through long-term implementation, and in the practice of mass work, carry forward and expand the glorious tradition of our company in maintaining discipline and loving the people.

    三大纪律八项注意是我军政治工作的一项重要内容
    李国辉（炊事员、团支部群众工作委员）：
    团支部分工我担任群众工作委员，起初，我认为做群众工作，检查群众纪律，干的尽是些婆婆妈妈的罗嗦事，哪有工夫干这些麻烦事。副指导员胡同福看透了我的心事，找我谈心，他先讲了一段大别山剿匪的故事：一九四九年七月，我连奉命歼灭流窜在大别山区的一股残匪，开始只用军事围剿，常常扑空。后来加强了政治攻势，实行军政合剿，部队由干部带领分散住在各个村庄，分头做群众工作，开展爱民活动，向群众讲我军的三大纪律八项注意、宽待俘虏等政策，帮老乡割草、挑水、推磨、种地，边劳动边宣传，在抢险救灾中拿出自己的口粮救济贫苦群众。由于赢得了群众的信任，群众纷纷行动起来，主动向我军报告匪情、报告土匪武装匿藏的枪支，并展开了群众性的攻心战。在广大群众的协助下，我们实行军事打击和政治瓦解相配合，很快地取得了全歼大别山残匪的巨大胜利。讲完这段故事，副指导员又给我说明了这条根本纪律对我军团结内部，团结群众，战胜敌人，保证部队战斗力所起的伟大作用，使我认识到执行三大纪律八项注意是我军政治工作的一项不可缺少的重要内容，在我军建设的全部历史上，在我军建设的各个方面，都发挥了极大的作用。在红军的初创时期，由于严格贯彻了三大纪律八项注意和一系列政治工作制度，使我军有效地扫除了一切旧军队的恶劣影响，从而建设成为一支完全新型的人民军队。在长期的对敌斗争中，由于我军彻底执行三大纪律八项注意，迅速地提高了我军的战斗力，有效地瓦解了敌军的士气。三大纪律八项注意项项都充满着政治内容，条条都是党的路线、政策的具体体现。做群众工作，检查群众纪律，虽然接触和处理的都是一些小事，可是这小事里面有大文章。今后，我决心要把贯彻执行三大纪律八项注意当作一项政治任务来抓，在长期执行三大纪律八项注意中来进一步领会、掌握三大纪律八项注意，在群众工作的实践中把我们连遵纪爱民光荣传统发扬光大。
