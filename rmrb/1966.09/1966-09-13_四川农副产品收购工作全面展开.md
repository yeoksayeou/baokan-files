    Sichuan's agricultural and sideline products procurement work fully underway

    From late August to September 7, the amount of cotton procured increased by 58 percent compared to the same period last year, and the quality of new cotton is better than last year; hemp procurement has exceeded the planned target.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 12—The procurement season for agricultural and sideline products in Sichuan Province has arrived, and the procurement front is presenting a great situation. Tens of thousands of commercial workers, in accordance with the central government's instructions to seize the revolution and promote production, are determined to channel the revolutionary enthusiasm sparked by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into procurement work, striving to achieve a brilliant victory in procurement work.

    This year, except for tobacco leaves, other agricultural and sideline products in Sichuan have all had a good harvest. Currently, the procurement of cotton, hemp, tea, and some local specialties has been fully launched. More than a thousand procurement stations in cotton-producing areas across the province have begun busy procurement activities. From late August to September 7, the amount of cotton procured in the province increased by 58 percent compared to the same period last year, and the grade of the procured new cotton has generally improved by one level compared to last year.

    The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist education movement have inspired the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of community members. Many poor and lower-middle peasants in cotton-producing areas said that delivering good cotton to the workers' older brothers to weave good cloth is their duty. Many production team cadres in Chengguan District, Pengxi County, said: Without Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no harvest this year. We will always follow Chairman Mao's words, deliver good cotton, and support national construction. This district delivers more than 20,000 jin of good cotton every day.

    At present, the province has completed 40 percent more than the planned target for hemp procurement. The procurement of fine tea in Ya'an, Yibin, and Leshan prefectures has nearly completed the state procurement plan.

    Many supply and marketing cooperative workers have set up cotton procurement stations as propaganda stations for Mao Zedong Thought, allowing community members to rest, drink tea, and learn revolutionary principles at the procurement stations.

    把文化大革命中焕发起来的干劲用到工作中去
    四川农副产品收购工作全面展开
    八月下旬到九月七日，棉花收购量比去年同期上升百分之五十八，新棉质量比去年好；大麻收购已超额完成计划
    据新华社成都十二日电　四川省农副产品收购旺季已经到来，收购战线上呈现一片大好形势。成千上万名商业职工按照中央关于抓革命促生产的指示，决心把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发起来的革命积极性，运用到收购工作中去，争取在收购工作中打一个漂亮仗。
    四川今年除烟叶外，其他农副产品都获得好收成。目前，棉花、麻类、茶叶和一部分土特产品的收购工作已经全面展开。全省各产棉区有一千多个收购站开始了繁忙的收购活动。从八月下旬到九月七日，全省棉花收购量比去年同期上升百分之五十八，收购的新棉等级普遍比去年上升一级。
    无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义教育运动鼓舞了广大社员的政治热情。产棉区的许多贫下中农社员说，交售好棉让工人老大哥织好布，是自己应尽的责任。蓬溪县城关区的许多生产队干部说：没有毛泽东思想，便没有今年的丰收，我们永远要听毛主席的话，交售好棉，支援国家建设。这个区每天交售的好棉达两万多斤。
    目前全省已经超额百分之四十完成了大麻收购计划。雅安、宜宾、乐山等专区收购的细茶已接近完成国家收购计划。
    许多供销社职工把棉花收购站布置成毛泽东思想的宣传站，使社员们在收购站里得到休息，喝上茶，还学到许多革命道理。
