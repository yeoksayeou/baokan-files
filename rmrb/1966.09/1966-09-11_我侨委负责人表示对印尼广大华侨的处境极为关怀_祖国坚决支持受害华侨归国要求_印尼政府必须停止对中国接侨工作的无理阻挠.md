	Chinese Overseas Affairs Commission Official Expresses Deep Concern for Indonesian Overseas Chinese
	Motherland Firmly Supports the Return of Injured Overseas Chinese
	Indonesian Government Must Stop Unreasonable Obstruction of China's Repatriation Work

	New China News Agency, September 10th - Our reporter interviewed the responsible person of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission regarding the issue of the Chinese government dispatching ships to Indonesia to repatriate overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return. The responsible person of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission made the following statement:

	The broad masses of overseas Chinese who have lived in Indonesia for generations have suffered brutal persecution, entirely due to the Indonesian government's implementation of anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese policies. The Chinese government is deeply concerned about the current situation of the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. As early as May 18th, the Chinese government had already notified the Indonesian government of its decision to dispatch ships to Indonesia to repatriate injured overseas Chinese. However, due to the deliberate obstruction by the Indonesian government, the Chinese repatriation ships have been waiting for several months without being able to set sail.

	Under the persistent urging of the Chinese government, the Indonesian Embassy in China, following instructions from its government, replied on June 29th, expressing that the Indonesian government is willing to negotiate with the Chinese government on the issue of overseas Chinese returning to their homeland, and that the Indonesian Embassy will represent the Indonesian government in negotiations in Beijing. The Chinese government agreed to this proposal, and responsible officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission held the first formal negotiation with the acting charge d'affaires of the Indonesian Embassy in Beijing on July 18th. During this negotiation, the Indonesian side agreed to the Chinese government dispatching ships to Indonesia to repatriate overseas Chinese; regarding the specific time and related requirements for the dispatch of Chinese ships, it also expressed that it would respond as soon as possible. Regarding the specific issues related to the dispatch of Chinese ships to repatriate overseas Chinese, both sides agreed to further discuss and resolve them between the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jakarta.

	However, after this negotiation, the Indonesian side changed its stance, unilaterally terminated the negotiations; regarding the agreed record of the negotiations, it added unnecessary conditions and refused to sign; regarding the date and related requirements for the dispatch of Chinese ships, it delayed responding. Even the request by the responsible officials of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia to meet with the corresponding officials of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiations encountered great difficulties, either being delayed with excuses or outright refused to meet. The relevant officials of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs even unreasonably pretended not to know about the negotiations held in Beijing and the agreements reached. It is precisely due to the Indonesian government's attitude of flip-flopping and extreme irresponsibility that the issue of Chinese ships repatriating overseas Chinese has not been resolved for a long time.

	The responsible person of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission pointed out that in the past few months, the Indonesian government has not only not stopped its anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese policies but has intensified them, subjecting overseas Chinese to various forms of persecution. The Indonesian government openly ordered the closure and takeover of overseas Chinese organizations and schools, the interrogation and expulsion of the responsible persons of overseas Chinese organizations and schools, and even the forced relocation of overseas Chinese within a deadline. The property of overseas Chinese has been looted, and their houses have been seized, driving away everyone, young and old, causing a large number of overseas Chinese to lose their homes and become homeless. While the Indonesian government is driving out and persecuting overseas Chinese on a large scale, it is also strenuously obstructing Chinese ships from going to repatriate the injured overseas Chinese, causing a large number of overseas Chinese to lose their means of livelihood and be in dire straits.

	The responsible person of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission pointed out that the Indonesian government's actions not only provoked strong protests from the Chinese people and the broad masses of overseas Chinese but are also despised by the world's just public opinion. Under such circumstances, the Indonesian government was forced to agree on September 2nd to allow Chinese ships to go to Medan and Banda Aceh to repatriate overseas Chinese. The Chinese government notified the Indonesian government on September 5th that the first Chinese repatriation ship will arrive in Medan around September 20th. The Chinese government will also successively dispatch repatriation ships to Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, and other relevant ports in Indonesia. The Chinese government, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the work of repatriating injured overseas Chinese, has put forward five items of requirements to the Indonesian government, which are entirely reasonable. The Indonesian government has the responsibility to resolve them without delay.

	The responsible person of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission finally pointed out that injured overseas Chinese in Indonesia must overcome various obstacles and difficulties and be prepared for a serious struggle to realize their wish to return to their homeland. However, they have the warm concern and firm support of the people and government of their homeland. They have the sympathy and assistance of the Indonesian people. They will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and achieve victory, returning to the embrace of their homeland.

    我侨委负责人表示对印尼广大华侨的处境极为关怀
    祖国坚决支持受害华侨归国要求
    印尼政府必须停止对中国接侨工作的无理阻挠
    新华社十日讯　本社记者就中国政府派船前往印度尼西亚接运自愿返国的受害华侨问题访问了华侨事务委员会负责人。华侨事务委员会负责人发表谈话如下：
    世世代代居住在印尼的广大华侨受到残酷迫害，完全是推行反华排华政策的印尼政府一手造成的。中国政府对印尼广大华侨当前的处境极为关怀。中国政府早在五月十八日就已照会印尼政府，决定派船前往印尼接运受害华侨返国。但是，由于印尼政府蓄意阻挠，中国接侨船只等了几个月不能启航。
    在中国政府不断的催促下，印尼驻华大使馆奉其政府的指示，于六月二十九日复照表示，印尼政府愿意就华侨回国问题同中国政府进行商谈，并由印尼大使馆代表印尼政府在北京商谈。中国政府同意这一建议，由外交部和华侨事务委员会的负责官员同印尼大使馆临时代办于七月十八日在北京举行了第一次正式商谈。在这一次商谈中，印尼方面表示同意中国政府派船前往印尼接侨；对于中国派船的具体时间和有关要求，也表示将尽快作出答复。对于有关中国派船接侨的具体问题，双方同意由中国驻印尼大使馆和印尼外交部在雅加达进一步讨论解决。
    可是，在这一次商谈以后，印尼方面就变了卦，片面中断了商谈；对双方商定的记要文本，节外生枝，拒绝签字；对中国派船的日期和有关各项要求则拖延不复。连中国驻印尼大使馆的负责官员要求同印尼外交部的相应官员会晤商谈，也遇到很大的困难，或则托词推延会晤时间，或则干脆拒绝接见。印尼外交部有关官员甚至毫无道理地佯装根本不知道在北京举行的商谈和已经达成的协议。正是由于印尼政府这种出尔反尔和极端不负责任的态度，中国派船接侨问题长期得不到解决。
    华侨事务委员会负责人指出，这几个月来，印尼政府不仅没有停止反华排华，而且变本加厉，对华侨进行种种迫害。印尼政府公然下令封闭和接管华侨团体和学校，审讯和驱逐华侨团体和学校的负责人，甚至对华侨限期逼迁，华侨的财产被抢光，房屋被霸占，不论男女老少统统被赶走，致使大批华侨倾家荡产，流离失所。印尼政府一方面大规模地迫害和驱逐华侨，另一方面又竭力阻挠中国派船去接运受害的华侨返国，使大批华侨生计断绝，处于水深火热之中。
    华侨事务委员会负责人指出，印尼这种做法，不但引起中国人民和广大华侨的强烈抗议，也为世界公正舆论所不齿。在这种情况下，印尼政府被迫于九月二日表示同意中国派船到棉兰和班达亚齐去接侨。中国政府已于九月五日通知印尼政府，中国第一艘接侨船只将于九月二十日左右抵达棉兰。中国政府还将陆续派出接侨船只前往雅加达、泗水、望加锡和印尼的其它有关港口。中国政府为了使接运受害华侨工作能够顺利进行，向印尼政府提出了五项要求，这是完全合情合理的，印尼政府有责任毫不拖延地予以解决。
    华侨事务委员会负责人最后指出，印尼受害华侨要实现他们返回祖国的愿望，还必须克服种种阻力和困难，还要准备进行严正的斗争。但是他们有祖国人民和政府的热切关怀和坚决支持。他们有印尼人民的同情和协助。他们一定能够排除万难，取得胜利，回到祖国的怀抱。
