The liberation forces of South Vietnam recently launched a successful attack on the enemy's important stronghold in the Mekong Delta, annihilating an entire enemy battalion and shattering the enemy's illusion of "stabilizing the Mekong Delta plain."

The "Mỹ Tho" stronghold, located in the western part of the Tam Kỳ region in the province of Mỹ Tho, is the largest military base in the Mỹ An military sub-zone. It is heavily fortified and boasted by the enemy as an "impregnable stronghold."

On a recent night, the liberation army swiftly captured the surrounding positions of the stronghold and immediately launched a barrage of artillery and other firepower, destroying the enemy's firepower points and paving the way for the assault teams. Following this, the soldiers bravely charged into the enemy stronghold. After nearly two hours of fierce combat, the entire enemy battalion was annihilated.

This resounding victory of the liberation forces demonstrates their ability not only to successfully annihilate enemy forces outside the stronghold but also to eliminate entire enemy battalions concentrated within the stronghold.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 2nd, Saigon: In recent weeks, guerrilla forces across South Vietnam have intensified their flexible and proactive attacks on American and puppet forces.

According to Western news agencies, the number of guerrilla attacks in South Vietnam increased to 670 times in the week from August 21 to 27. In the previous week, the number of attacks was 556.

    一举攻占敌人重要据点　全歼伪军主力部队一营
    南越解放军在湄公河三角洲又打胜仗
    新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量不久前在湄公河三角洲英勇攻克了伪军的美虎据点，全歼敌人一个营，粉碎了敌人所谓“稳定了湄公河三角洲平原地区”的美梦。
    美虎据点，是美伪军在同塔梅地区西部沙沥省美安军事支区的最大的军事基地。它戒备森严，被敌人吹嘘为“攻不破的据点”。
    不久前的一个夜晚，解放军神速地攻占了据点周围的阵地，并且即刻用各种炮火一齐向敌人轰击，摧毁了敌人据点的各个火力点，为突击队开辟冲锋的道路。接着，战士们勇敢地冲进敌人的据点，经过近两个小时的战斗，把守敌一个营全部消灭。
    解放武装力量取得的这一辉煌胜利，表明它不仅能够成功地歼灭据点外面的敌人，而且能歼灭集中在据点里的整营敌人的主力部队。
    据新华社二日讯　西贡消息：越南南方各地游击队最近以来加紧主动灵活地袭击美伪军。
    据西方通讯社报道，越南南方各地游击队在八月二十一日到二十七日的一周内，出击的次数激增到六百七十次。而在上一周内，出击的次数是五百五十六次。
