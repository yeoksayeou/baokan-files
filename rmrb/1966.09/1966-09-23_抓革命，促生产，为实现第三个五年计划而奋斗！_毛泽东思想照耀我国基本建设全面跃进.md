The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is held high on the front line of China's basic construction. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers is continuously enhanced, and their enthusiasm for construction is surging. Taking Daqing as an example, they are experimenting with factory-commune integration, factory-led communes, and industrial-agricultural cooperation, achieving new experiences in industrial and agricultural construction and production.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 22nd, the broad masses of workers on China's basic construction front are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. In the three great revolutionary movements, especially in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, their political consciousness is continuously enhanced, and their enthusiasm for construction is surging. They are forging ahead on the socialist construction road, overcoming all difficulties, and achieving one victory after another, driving the entire basic construction front to make comprehensive leaps forward.

The basic construction investment completed from January to August this year has increased by 18% compared to the same period last year. The number of large and medium-sized construction projects that have been fully or partially completed and put into production has significantly increased compared to the same period last year. The production capacity of industrial products such as electricity, coal, cement, and sugar has increased significantly, with new electricity generation capacity and coal production capacity both increasing severalfold compared to the same period last year. The speed of engineering construction, especially mine construction, has been greatly accelerated. In the past, it took four to five years to build a large coal mine; now, some advanced units have increased the speed of shaft and tunnel excavation, and can complete the construction in just over two years. Significant achievements have also been made in saving construction investment. Civil construction has universally promoted the spirit of "rammed earth," with workers taking the initiative, adapting to local conditions, and using local materials to build a large number of economical and practical houses and dormitories. The construction cost per square meter has generally been reduced by more than half compared to the past. Sichuan Province, through the widespread promotion of "rammed earth," can save about 40% of the red brick usage this year, reversing the situation of red brick supply tension in recent years, and greatly reducing the pressure on local transportation. The quality of basic construction projects this year has also been universally improved.

The significant achievements in basic construction work are the result of the broad masses of workers emphasizing politics and studying Chairman Mao's works actively. Since this year, various levels of leadership departments and grassroots units on the basic construction front have universally launched a major debate on emphasizing politics. Through the debate, the tendency to neglect politics and "see things but not people" has been criticized; the idea of "politics leading construction" has begun to take root among cadres. Many outdated rules and regulations that shackle the development of productive forces and restrict people's enthusiasm and creativity have been broken, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the worker masses has been further ignited.

Especially in the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers on the basic construction front, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are on the one hand, criticizing and denouncing the capitalist roaders in power within the Party, criticizing bourgeois academic "authorities," sweeping away all ghosts and snakes, breaking all kinds of foreign frameworks and outdated customs, and breaking all old ideas; on the other hand, they are treating the construction site as a battlefield, treating the pickaxe as a gun, racing against time, and striving to speed up the construction pace. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, and the First Ministry of Light Industry, among others, have all increased their basic construction investment by more than 25% in August compared to July.

Since this year, the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works has been more universally launched in basic construction units. The broad masses of workers in construction enterprises are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, using Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to transform both the subjective and objective worlds. Through study, Chairman Mao's strategic line of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people has been deeply ingrained in people's minds. More and more people can consciously link their labor of every shovel and pickaxe to the cause of socialist construction and the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, taking the initiative to shoulder heavy burdens, tackle difficult tasks, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and wholeheartedly building for the revolution. On the basic construction front, many heroes like Zhang Chunyu of a certain unit of the Railway Corps have emerged, who are brave and selfless.

With the deepening of the design revolution, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become the norm in many design units. The design personnel of the 40th team of the Chongqing Black Metallurgy Design Institute, while revising the design of a certain machine repair factory, studied Chairman Mao's works extensively, broke away from the "I" and from metaphysics, discarded various foreign frameworks, and with a thorough revolutionary spirit and a realistic attitude, revised the design, reducing the foundation depth by more than half, and the roof weight by more than half, which can save 47% of the investment in the civil construction part of the factory.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of cadres and workers on the basic construction front have broken superstitions and freed their minds, with new things and new experiences constantly emerging. Many departments have adopted the method of "three olds bringing three news" (old bases bringing new bases, old factories bringing new factories, old workers bringing new workers) and "skilled workers leading civilian workers" (using a small number of skilled workers as the backbone to lead the broad masses of civilian workers to work together) to carry out the "technical revolution of civil construction," making full use of idle and accumulated materials, thereby greatly accelerating the construction speed and saving construction investment.

Many construction units and new factories are taking Daqing as an example, further experimenting with factory-commune integration, factory-led communes, and industrial-agricultural cooperation, achieving new experiences in industrial and agricultural construction and production. They not only provide strong support to the surrounding communes and production brigades in terms of production technology and culture and hygiene, but also first help the peasants politically, helping them carry out socialist education, helping them study Chairman Mao's works, publicizing the Party's policies and guidelines, and publicizing the spirit of Dazhai, thereby enhancing the political consciousness of the peasants, promoting the development of agricultural production, and mobilizing the broad masses of peasants to participate in construction. They enthusiastically support the construction of factories, providing labor, skilled workers, transportation, bricks and tiles, supplying vegetables and sideline products, and safeguarding the safety of the construction site, thereby greatly promoting industrial construction.

At present, the broad masses of workers on the basic construction front across the country are actively implementing the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to grasp the revolution and promote production, striving to complete this year's basic construction plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfillment, and seize greater victories in revolution and construction.

    抓革命，促生产，为实现第三个五年计划而奋斗！
    毛泽东思想照耀我国基本建设全面跃进
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大职工政治觉悟不断提高，建设热情日益高涨
    以大庆为榜样，试行厂社结合，以厂带社，工农并举，取得了工农业生产建设的新经验
    据新华社二十二日讯　我国基本建设战线广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在三大革命运动中，特别在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，政治觉悟不断提高，建设热情日益高涨。他们在社会主义建设大道上排除万难，阔步前进，取得了一个又一个的新胜利，推动了整个基本建设战线的全面跃进。
    他们在今年一月到八月内完成的基本建设投资，比去年同期增长百分之十八。全部和部分建成投产的大中型建设项目比去年同期大量增加。电力、煤炭、水泥、食糖等工业产品的生产能力，大幅度增长，其中新增发电能力和煤炭生产能力，都比去年同期成倍增长。工程建设的速度，特别是矿山建设的速度大大加快了。过去建设一个大型煤矿矿井，一般需要四五年的时间；现在有些先进单位由于提高了井巷掘进速度，两年多就可以建成了。在节约建设投资方面，也取得了显著成绩。民用建筑普遍地发扬了“干打垒”精神，职工们自己动手，因地制宜，就地取材，建造起大批经济实用的住宅和宿舍，每平方米的建设造价，一般都比过去降低一半以上。四川省由于大搞“干打垒”，今年可节省红砖用量百分之四十左右，扭转了近年来红砖供应紧张的局面，并且大大减轻了对地方运输的压力。今年基本建设的工程质量，也普遍提高。
    基本建设工作取得的这些重大成绩，是广大职工突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作的结果。今年以来，在基本建设战线各级领导部门和基层单位，普遍开展了一场突出政治的大辩论。通过辩论，批判了忽视政治和“见物不见人”的倾向；“政治统帅建设”的思想，在干部中开始树立起来。许多束缚生产力发展和限制人们积极性、创造性的陈规旧章被冲破了，职工群众的革命热情更加高涨了。
    特别在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，基本建设战线广大职工靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，一面口诛笔伐，向党内走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，大破各种洋框框和陈规陋习，大破一切旧思想；一面把工地当战场，把镐头当刀枪，争分夺秒，努力加快建设步伐。石油工业部、建筑材料工业部、第一机械工业部、第一轻工业部等系统，八月份所完成的基本建设投资都比七月份增长了百分之二十五以上。
    今年以来，学习毛主席著作的群众运动，在基本建设单位更加普遍地开展起来。施工企业的广大职工，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想当作改造主观世界和客观世界的锐利武器。通过学习，毛主席关于备战、备荒、为人民的战略方针，更加深入人心。越来越多的人能够自觉地把自己一锹一镐的劳动，同社会主义建设事业和反帝反修的斗争联系起来，主动挑重担，抢难活，不怕累，不怕苦，一心一意为革命搞建设。在基本建设战线，已经出现了不少像铁道兵某部张春玉同志那样英勇顽强、舍己救人的英雄人物。
    随着设计革命运动的深入发展，活学活用毛主席著作在许多设计单位已经成为风气。重庆黑色冶金设计院四○工作队的设计人员，在修改某机修厂的设计中，大学毛主席著作，大破“我”字，大破形而上学，甩掉了各种洋框框，以彻底革命的精神和实事求是的态度修改设计，把基础深度缩减了一半以上，屋盖重量减轻了一半以上，可使这个工厂土建部分的投资节省百分之四十七。
    基本建设战线广大干部和群众，在毛泽东思想的指引下，破除迷信，解放思想，新事物新经验不断出现。不少部门在建设中采取“三老带三新”（老基地带新基地、老工厂带新工厂、老工人带新工人）、“技工带民工”（以少量技工为骨干，带领广大民工共同施工）的办法，开展“土建技术革命”，充分利用闲置和积压物资，从而大大加快了建设速度，节约了建设投资。
    许多施工单位和新建工厂以大庆为榜样，进一步试行厂社结合，以厂带社，工农并举，取得了多快好省地进行工农业生产建设的新经验。他们不仅对周围的公社和大队从生产技术、文化卫生方面给以大力支援，而且首先从政治上给农民以帮助，帮助农民搞社会主义教育运动，帮助农民学习毛主席著作，宣传党的方针政策，宣传大寨精神，从而提高了农民的政治觉悟，促进了农业生产的发展，并且调动了广大农民参加建设的积极性。他们热情地支援工厂的建设，出民工，出“巧匠”，搞运输，烧砖瓦，供应蔬菜副食品，保卫工地安全，又大大地促进了工业建设。
    目前，全国基本建设战线的广大职工，正在积极地贯彻执行党中央和毛主席抓革命促生产的伟大号召，力争提前超额完成今年的基本建设计划，夺取革命和建设的更大胜利。
