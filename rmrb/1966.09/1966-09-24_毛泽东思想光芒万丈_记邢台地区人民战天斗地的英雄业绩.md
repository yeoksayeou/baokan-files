Our country is a great proletarian dictatorship, a socialist state with 700 million people. We need a unified thought, a revolutionary thought, a correct thought, and that is Mao Zedong Thought. ... We must promote the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and infuse Mao Zedong Thought into the minds of workers and peasants, to change the spiritual outlook of the laboring people, and to transform spiritual power into tremendous material force.

— Lin Biao

This year, the Xingtai region, which suffered a severe earthquake in March, is now bustling with prosperity. New houses are being built, and people are joyful. During the busy autumn harvest season, people carry the Little Red Book and sing "The East Is Red" and "Chairman Mao's Book Is the Revolutionary Treasure," happily heading to the fields to harvest golden crops.

The earthquake in the Xingtai region was a once-in-a-century disaster. In the face of such a severe calamity, the people of Xingtai achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The summer harvest increased, and the autumn harvest was also good. Every production brigade and team saw a significant increase in grain production. Formerly grain-surplus brigades are now even more affluent; villages that previously relied on state relief grain now have surplus grain to sell to the state.

This is a revolutionary transformation! What force has brought about such a tremendous change in this disaster-stricken area in just half a year? People unanimously say: It is Mao Zedong Thought that has armed our minds! It is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that has given us boundless strength!

"Houses may fall, but our spirits will not; the earth may shake, but we will not."

People will never forget what force made them stand firm in times of danger.

As soon as the earthquake struck, soldiers from the People's Liberation Army rushed to the scene. They carried the Little Red Book and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda boards, entering the villages with the first words, "Comrades, Chairman Mao has sent us!" Their first task was to rescue people and property while spreading Chairman Mao's teachings:

"In times of difficulty, we must see our achievements, see the light, and boost our morale."

"With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, we will strive for victory."

...

The people in the disaster-stricken areas, upon hearing Chairman Mao's words, were immediately inspired. The cadres stood up! The masses stood up! Men, women, old, and young, all stood up! Under the banner of the great Mao Zedong Thought, they quickly launched a fierce battle against the severe disaster!

In Dongmaozhai, the earthquake took the life of the party branch secretary, and the brigade leader was injured, leaving the party's grassroots organization temporarily leaderless. What to do?

That day, soldiers from the People's Liberation Army arrived. They put down their backpacks and immediately convened a mass meeting, spreading Chairman Mao's instructions. When the soldiers spoke about Chairman Mao saying that without poor peasants there would be no revolution, and that poor and lower-middle peasants are the backbone, the people immediately became lively. The soldiers asked, "Where is the command center? Who is the commander?" The Communist Party member and old poor peasant, Guo Xihun, immediately stepped forward, loudly answering, "This is the command center, and I am the commander!" The surrounding community members looked at him and unanimously said, "Right! Guo Xihun, you command!" The needs of the revolution and the people aroused this old warrior, who had fought in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, with a strong sense of responsibility. He thought, "The people have suffered a disaster, and the party branch secretary has sacrificed himself. If we don't take charge, who will? Following Chairman Mao's words, we must raise the banner!"

Guo Xihun took on the responsibility of leading the entire village in disaster relief. He carried "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," learning and practicing wherever he went. The entire village of over 1,800 people tightly united around the party branch, launching a vigorous disaster relief struggle. Guo Xihun was full of energy, working day and night without entering his home, going for days without a proper meal or a good night's sleep. He led the community members to build shelters but did not build his own. He led in everything, doing everything first.

In Suzhuang Brigade, this village at the epicenter of the earthquake suffered significant losses. The old poor peasant Liu Luochun, facing the devastated village, thought, "How will we manage in the future?" The soldiers came and told him, "With the party and Chairman Mao, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome!" They then read "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to him. He could not sit still any longer, standing up and saying, "Chairman Mao's words have lit a lamp in my heart. I understand that Chairman Mao teaches us to have the spirit of poor and lower-middle peasants and to fight against the earthquake!" The next day, he gathered a group of community members who were skilled in blacksmithing to go to the agricultural machinery repair shop to repair tools. This 68-year-old old blacksmith worked with great enthusiasm, going to work at dawn and returning at dusk. His wife scolded him for not resting. He said, "We have suffered a great disaster, and the party and Chairman Mao care for us so much, sending the People's Liberation Army and medical teams, and helping us study Chairman Mao's works. We are poor peasants. If we don't stand up and work, what will we do? I wish I could work two days in one!"

Mao Zedong Thought armed thousands and tens of thousands of Guo Xihun and Liu Luochun. They feared neither heaven nor earth, each one spirited and full of fighting spirit. Their heroic words were: "You shake, and I will work! Houses may fall, but our spirits will not; the earth may shake, but we will not!" Many community members, during another earthquake, fearlessly rushed to save people's lives and property, grabbing Chairman Mao's works and shouting, "If the pots and pans are broken, it's no big deal, as long as we have Chairman Mao's precious book, even if the sky falls, we are not afraid!" The community members, carrying Chairman Mao's book, fearlessly rushed to save people's lives and property. Some were injured by collapsing walls but continued the battle after wiping off the blood.

"Facing difficulties, fighting against heaven and earth."

In the days of rebuilding their homes, the great Mao Zedong Thought made the people of the disaster-stricken areas the smartest and bravest, becoming heroes who fear no hardship and difficulty.

Some community members initially had the idea of relying on state relief. The soldiers, targeting the community's active thoughts, repeatedly organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "self-reliance and hard struggle," repeatedly spreading Chairman Mao's words: "We advocate self-reliance. We hope for external aid, but we cannot rely on it. We rely on our own efforts and the creativity of the entire military and civilian population." Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts immediately produced tremendous power. The people in the disaster-stricken areas said, "Material assistance is limited, but the power of self-reliance is boundless." They proposed inspiring slogans: "Facing difficulties, fighting against heaven and earth." "Not relying on the earth or heaven, but on heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought." Many brigades and teams proposed "three wants" and "three don'ts": wanting Mao Zedong Thought, wanting self-reliance, wanting collective strength; not wanting relief grain, relief funds, or relief materials. Self-reliance and striving for progress emerged like bamboo shoots after a rain.

In Puzi Brigade, the sand brought by the earthquake covered the green wheat seedlings. What to do? The soldiers led everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Men, women, old, and young, with the spirit of moving mountains, all went to the fields, shoveling and carrying, fighting for several days and nights, removing the sand and clearing the wheat seedlings. As soon as the wheat seedlings were cleared, another earthquake occurred, and the sand filled the fields again. The people of Puzi did not lose heart or give up, resolutely saying, "It fills, and we will clear it. Fill once, clear once, and we will not let it take away a single wheat seedling!" The second sand-clearing battle began. The community members worked early and late, shoveling sand and supporting the seedlings, ensuring the wheat seedlings grew vigorously.

The people of the disaster-stricken areas, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were determined and ambitious in the face of severe disasters. In the earthquake epicenter area, there is a village called Yangzhuang, known as small in size, great in disaster, and high in spirit, a typical example of self-reliance starting with learning "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." This village has only 66 households, suffering from continuous disasters, and is a low-lying saline-alkali land with low production levels, relying on state relief grain every year. The earthquake caused significant losses. The soldiers and everyone together studied "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The community members, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," all said, "We are a small village with over 200 people. As long as we have the thought of farming for the revolution, each person is a noble person!" After studying "Serve the People," people said, "In the past, we stood at the stove corner, seeing only our heels; in the future, we will stand in Yangzhuang, seeing the whole world!" After studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," people resolved to change the backward face of Yangzhuang. Those who said they could not live here and wanted to leave no longer wanted to leave; those who lacked enthusiasm now worked with great spirit. At that time, it was the anti-drought and sowing season, everyone went to the fields, and the entire village had no idle people. The 70-year-old poor peasant old woman Niu Shengzhi insisted on going to the fields, and no one could persuade her. She said, "What Chairman Mao says, I will do. Chairman Mao tells us to be self-reliant, and I will not fall behind." The village also had 12 children around 10 years old who, after reading Chairman Mao's book, went to the fields to fight drought, carrying water to sow seeds, eagerly working, and secretly working, saying, "We are the 'little shock troops' for revolutionary farming. Where there is difficulty, we go!" In this way, Yangzhuang, after the earthquake, increased its farming area by 10% compared to before the disaster, with wheat production far exceeding previous years, ensuring seeds, food, and reserve grain, and selling 12,000 jin to the state. The change from relying on relief grain to selling surplus grain in Yangzhuang is a tremendous change! The change in Yangzhuang represents the change in thousands of villages in the disaster-stricken areas. They created miraculous feats and wrote magnificent chapters in the construction of production development and home rebuilding.

"For the people, not for oneself, with a red heart loving the collective."

Mao Zedong Thought armed the masses, making them not only dare to face any difficulty, becoming heroes who fight against heaven and earth, but more importantly, their worldview underwent a leap. Their minds were no longer filled with pots and pans and work points, but with a heart for the public, a heart for the collective, and a heart for walking the socialist road. They said, "For the people, not for oneself, with a red heart loving the collective."

The old poor peasant woman Zhao Xinxiao previously had some selfish thoughts. The soldiers and she together read Chairman Mao's book, and the more she studied, the warmer her heart became, and the more she loved the new society and the collective. She said, "This old woman's red heart is nailed to the collective!" When the brigade was building new houses, she found the brigade cadres and requested to take out the 400 jin of lime and 5,000 new bricks stored at home for the collective. She said, "As long as it is for the collective, for consolidating the people's commune, use whatever is needed!" The middle peasant member Zhen Shukai previously did not care much about the collective. The soldiers enthusiastically helped him study "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Zhen Shukai opened his eyes and said, "Firmly follow Chairman Mao's words and no longer calculate my own 'small accounts.'" One day, he carried out the new plow he had hidden for many years and handed it over to the production team. This plow, when the agricultural cooperative was established ten years ago, he refused to hand over to the collective, but now he said, "Handing over the new plow, discarding old thoughts!"

In Bai Jia Le, people put the public first in everything, and good deeds emerged in layers. The brick kiln stopped firing in the day, and at night, someone came to unload the bricks. Who did it? No one knew, but only saw a poem left on the kiln: "In the dark night, we come to unload bricks, fighting for four hours, sweating all over, not feeling tired or bitter, the heart is very comfortable." Signed "Screw." There was an orphan named Guo Yunji who woke up in the middle of the night to see a package in the house, containing a set of clothes and a pair of shoes. Who sent it? No one knew. There was only an unsigned note saying, "I saw your clothes were torn, so I made you a new set. Please accept it!" In this village, there were six girls whose names all contained the character "mian," and people called them the "Six Mian Girls." They said they changed to the character "mian" to pass on the Mao Zedong Thought spread by the soldiers endlessly. These six girls, like the soldiers, deeply loved Mao Zedong Thought and studied Chairman Mao's works with great enthusiasm. They used their spare time to plant an experimental field on a piece of saline-alkali wasteland. Others advised them not to plant, but they said, "If the Foolish Old Man can move mountains, why can't we? We must have this spirit." When it rained heavily, they ran to the fields to drain water and prevent floods. They worked half the night, and the elderly in their families asked, "In the middle of the night, where did all the girls go?" They said, "Going to do the revolution!" They thought of the revolution and did things beneficial to the revolution. When the brigade's brick kiln ran out of soil, they pulled carts to deliver soil at night; when it rained, they covered the bricks on the kiln with thatch from their simple homes, covering them tightly.

In the Xingtai region, the spirit of dedicating oneself to the revolution and the collective, selflessly and altruistically, bloomed everywhere. "Living Lei Fengs" and "nameless heroes" were found in every village and everywhere. A production team leader was moved to say, "People armed with Mao Zedong Thought, that revolutionary spirit, that revolutionary enthusiasm, cannot be suppressed!"

"Believe neither in heaven nor in earth, believe only in Chairman Mao!"

Countless vivid facts made the broad masses of the people in the Xingtai region deeply feel the boundless power of the great Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "Believe neither in heaven nor in earth, believe only in Chairman Mao!"

Now, in the Xingtai area, whether in large towns or small villages, everywhere you can see people's boundless love, faith, and admiration for our great leader. They say, "No one is as close as Chairman Mao," "Chairman Mao's kindness can never be repaid." They hang Chairman Mao's portrait at home, with the words on both sides: "Red heart follows the Communist Party, generation after generation will not forget Chairman Mao." A five-good militia member named Wang Renceng made a slogan board at home, on which he wrote: "The Little Red Book hangs in the house, as if Chairman Mao came to my home. Whatever Chairman Mao says, I will do. Generation after generation will listen to his words."

Believing neither in heaven nor in earth, believing only in Chairman Mao, the people in the disaster-stricken areas tore down idols and smashed shrines, sweeping away old customs and habits. An old woman named Liang Xiaolian, after reading Chairman Mao's book, scolded the Buddha she had worshipped for many years, saying, "I worshipped you for decades, burning incense and kowtowing, you evil thing, what good have you done for me? What kindness? It is Chairman Mao who, upon disaster, sent people to save me. Chairman Mao is our great savior!" The poor peasant member Wang Hongzhang, after hearing the army's propaganda of Chairman Mao's "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism," tore down the wealth god he had worshipped for many years and pasted Chairman Mao's portrait, writing a couplet: "Never forget the Communist Party, generation after generation will not forget Chairman Mao," with the horizontal scroll reading: "Never forget our roots."

The Xingtai region is undergoing earth-shaking changes. People are breaking old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, replacing them with the trend of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Poor and lower-middle peasants say, "Among all the books in the world, thousands and thousands, Chairman Mao's book is the one we love to read the most." During the day, they take the Little Red Book to the fields, working a bit and studying a bit. At night, they go to the "Chairman Mao's Works Study Group," studying and discussing under the oil lamp. With boundless joy, they enthusiastically discuss how, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction, to build socialist new villages, and to support world revolution.

A massive earthquake disaster has been conquered, this is a miracle on earth!

Look at the records of earthquakes here in 1068 and 1820, "cities and towns collapsed, houses were destroyed, people were exposed and lacked food," "people scattered, fleeing like birds and beasts, many died on the roads," "sad and miserable, dim and confused, no longer human." ...

Think of today's people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, writing a heroic history of fighting against heaven and earth, and we cannot help but enthusiastically shout:

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, ten thousand times long live, our great leader Chairman Mao!

    毛泽东思想光芒万丈
    ——记邢台地区人民战天斗地的英雄业绩
    我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。……必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。
                              ——林彪
    今年三月遭受严重地震灾害的邢台地区，如今处处是一片繁荣兴旺的景象，新房幢幢，人欢马叫。在秋收大忙的日子里，人们一大早，就扛上毛主席语录牌，唱着《东方红》《毛主席的书是革命的宝》，欢天喜地来到田间，收获金色的庄稼。
    邢台地区的地震灾害是百年罕见的。在严重的灾害面前，邢台人民夺得了多年未有的大丰收。夏季增产了，秋季又是个好年景，社社队队粮食产量普遍增加。过去的余粮队现在更富足了；过去一直靠吃国家救济粮的村庄，也一跃而有余粮卖给国家。
    这是一个翻天覆地的大变化！是什么力量使这个重灾区在短短的半年时间里发生了这么大的变化？人们异口同声地说：是毛泽东思想武装了我们的头脑！是战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的力量！
    “房倒志不倒，地动人不摇”
    人们永远不能忘记在危难时刻，是什么力量使自己坚强地站起来的。
    地震刚过，解放军战士飞也似的赶来了。他们揣着《毛主席语录》，背着毛主席语录牌，进村的第一句话，就是：“乡亲们，毛主席派我们来了！”进村的第一件事，就是在抢救人民生命财产的同时，大讲毛主席的教导：
    “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    ……
    灾区人民听了毛主席的话，顿时群情振奋。干部们站起来了！广大群众站起来了！男的，女的，老的，少的，都站起来了！他们在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，迅速地向严重灾害展开搏斗！
    在东毛尔寨，地震夺去了党支部书记的生命，大队长也受了伤，党的基层组织一时无人负责。怎么办？
    当天，解放军战士来了，他们放下背包，就召开群众大会，宣讲毛主席的指示，当战士们讲到毛主席说没有贫农就没有革命，贫下中农是顶梁柱的时候，人们立即活跃起来。战士问：“指挥部在哪里？谁是总指挥？”共产党员、老贫农郭喜浑，马上挺身而出，响亮地回答：“这就是指挥部，我就是总指挥！”周围的社员看着他，异口同声地说：“对！老郭，你就指挥吧！”革命的需要，群众的需要，激发着这位在抗日战争和解放战争中南征北战的老战士强烈的责任感。他想：“人民遭了灾，支部书记牺牲了，咱不管谁管？听毛主席的话，咱就得扛起大旗来！”
    郭喜浑担起领导全村群众抗灾的重任。他带着《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》，走到哪，学到哪，干到哪。全村一千八百多人，紧紧团结在党支部的周围，掀起了轰轰烈烈的救灾斗争。郭喜浑浑身是劲，一天到晚不进家门，一连几天没有好好吃一顿饭，没有安稳睡一夜觉，他领导社员搭窝棚，可就是不搭自己的。样样干在前，做在前。
    在苏庄大队，这个地震中心的村庄，损失较大。老贫农刘洛春面对着这地震后的村庄，在想：“这个样子，以后咋办？”战士们来了，给他讲：“有党和毛主席，天大的困难也能克服！”接着又给他读《愚公移山》。他坐不住了，站起来说：“毛主席的话，在我心里挂上了一盏明灯，我明白，毛主席教导我们要拿出贫下中农的志气，跟地震斗！”第二天，他召集村里一帮会做铁匠活的社员到农具修配厂去修理农具。这位六十八岁的老铁匠，干得特别起劲，每天总是天明就去，天黑才回。老伴怪他没有休息。他说：“我们遭了大灾，党和毛主席对我们这样关怀，派来了解放军、医疗队，还帮我们学毛主席著作。我们是贫农，不挺起腰杆来干还行？我恨不得一天当两天干哩！”
    毛泽东思想武装起了千千万万个郭喜浑、刘洛春，他们天不怕，地不怕，个个精神焕发，斗志昂扬，他们的豪言壮语是：“你震你的，我干我的！”“房倒志不倒，地动人不摇”。多少社员在再次地震时，不顾一切地把毛主席著作抢出来，拍掉身上的土，举起毛主席著作，响亮地说：“坛坛罐罐砸坏了没啥，只要有毛主席的宝书，天塌了也不怕！”社员们揣着毛主席的书，不顾个人安危，奋勇抢救人民的生命财产，有的人被倒塌的墙壁打伤了，擦掉血迹继续战斗。
    “迎着困难走，战天斗地球”
    在重建家园的日子里，伟大的毛泽东思想又使灾区人民变得最聪明，最勇敢，成了不怕苦不畏难的英雄好汉。
    有些社员开初有依赖国家救济的想法，战士们针对着群众的活思想，反复组织大家学习毛主席有关“自力更生，艰苦奋斗”的教导，反复宣讲毛主席语录：“我们是主张自力更生的。我们希望有外援，但是我们不能依赖它，我们依靠自己的努力，依靠全体军民的创造力。”毛主席的光辉思想立即产生了巨大威力。灾区人民说：“物质支援是有限的，自力更生的威力是无穷的。”他们提出了动人心弦的口号：“迎着困难走，战天斗地球。”“不靠地不靠天，全靠毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄汉。”许多社、队提出“三要”、“三不要”：要靠毛泽东思想，要靠自力更生，要靠集体力量；不要救济粮、救济款、救济物资。自力更生、奋发图强的事迹，雨后春笋般地涌现出来。
    在铺头大队，地震带来的泥沙，淹盖了青青的麦苗。怎么办？战士们领着大家学《愚公移山》。男女老幼拿出愚公移山的劲头，纷纷下地，铲的铲，抬的抬，奋战几昼夜，搬走了沙子，清出了麦苗。麦苗刚清出，新的地震又发生了，泥沙又淤满麦田。铺头人民不泄气，不气馁，斩钉截铁地说：“它淤，俺就清，淤一次，清一次，决不让它夺走一株麦苗！”第二次清沙战斗又开始了。社员们早出晚归，铲淤沙，扶幼苗，确保了麦苗茁壮地成长。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的灾区人民，在严重的灾害面前，意志坚定，壮志凌云。在地震中心区有个杨庄，人们称它是村小、灾大、志气高，学《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》起家的自力更生的典型。这个村总共六十六户，连年遭灾，又是低洼盐碱地，生产水平低，年年吃国家的救济粮，地震又受到很大损失。战士们和大家一起学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》。社员们学了《纪念白求恩》，都说：“咱是小村，还有二百多号人，只要有了为革命种田的思想，每个人就是高尚的人！”学了《为人民服务》，人们又说：“过去是站在锅台角，看到脚后跟；往后要站在小杨庄，看到全世界！”学了《愚公移山》，人们立志要改变小杨庄的落后面貌。过去说这里活不下去要走的，现在不走了；打不起劲的，现在干活劲头特别大。当时，正是抗旱、播种季节，人人下地，全村没有一个闲人。七十多岁的贫农老大娘牛盛芝，争着下地，别人劝都劝不住，她说：“毛主席怎么说，我就怎么做，毛主席叫我们自力更生，我决不能落后。”村里还有十二个十岁左右的小孩，读了毛主席的书下地抗旱，一瓢一瓢端水点种，抢着干活，偷着干活，他们说：我们是为革命种田的“小突击队”，那里困难那里去！就这样，杨庄地震后，比受灾以前种地面积增加百分之十，小麦产量大大超过了往年，留足了种子、口粮、储备粮，卖给国家一万二千斤。杨庄从吃救济粮，到卖余粮，是一个多么大的变化啊！杨庄的变化，代表着灾区千百个村庄的变化，他们在发展生产，重建家园的建设中，创造出惊人的奇迹，写下了壮丽的篇章。
    “专为人，不为己，一颗红心爱集体。”
    毛泽东思想武装了群众，他们不仅敢于迎战任何困难，成为战天斗地的英雄好汉，更重要的是世界观发生了飞跃的变化。他们头脑里装的再不是坛坛罐罐，几个工分，而是一心为公，一心为集体，一心走社会主义道路。他们说：“专为人，不为己，一颗红心爱集体。”
    贫农老大娘赵新娇，以前有些私心杂念。战士们和她一起读毛主席的书，她越学越心热，越学越觉得新社会可爱，集体可爱。她说：“我老婆子这颗红心算钉在集体上了！”大队筹盖新房子，她找大队干部，要求把家里过去存的四百斤石灰和五千块新砖拿出来给集体。她说：“只要是为了集体，为了巩固人民公社，用啥就拿啥！”中农社员甄树科，过去不大关心集体。战士们热情地帮助他学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》。甄树科开窍了，他说：“坚决听毛主席的话，再也不打自己的‘小算盘’。”有一天，他从家里把藏了多年的新耠子扛了出来，送到生产队。这个耠子在十年前成立农业合作社时，他怎么也不肯交给社里，如今他说：“交出新耠子，丢了旧思想！”
    在白家寨，人们一事当先，公字当头，好人好事层出不穷。烧砖窑白天刚停火，夜晚就有人给出窑了，是谁干的？不知道，只见窑上留下一首诗：“深夜漆黑天，我们来出砖，奋战四小时，换得一身汗，不觉苦和累，心里挺舒坦。”署名是“螺丝钉”。有个孤儿叫国运吉，半夜醒来看到屋里有一个包裹，里面是一身衣服，一双鞋。谁送的，也不知道。只有一个没署名的条子，写道：“我见你的衣服破了，给你做一件，收下吧！”在这个村子里，有六个姑娘名字都带个绵字，人们叫她们“六绵姑娘”，她们说她们所以换上“绵”字，是为了把解放军传播的毛泽东思想连绵不断地传下去。这六个姑娘像战士们一样无限热爱毛泽东思想，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。她们利用业余时间，在一片盐碱荒地上种了块试验田，别人劝她们不要种，她们说：“愚公能移山，俺为什么不能干，俺就要争这口志气。”天下大雨，她们往地里跑，为的是排涝防洪。她们半夜半夜的干，家里老人问：“深更半夜的，一个个姑娘跑到哪里去了？”她们说：“干革命去了！”她们想的是革命，干的是对革命有益的事。队里的砖窑没土了，她们拉起排子车就连夜送土；天下雨了，窑上的土坯没有盖，她们又拿着自家简易房上的苇席，把土坯盖得严严实实。
    在邢台地区，一心为革命，一心为集体，毫不利己，专门利人的精神遍地开花，“活雷锋”“无名英雄”村村有，处处是。一位生产队长感动地说：“毛泽东思想武装起来的人，那种革命精神，那股革命干劲，要按也按不住！”
    “不信天，不信地，一心信仰毛主席！”
    无数的生动事实，使邢台地区广大人民群众深深体会到伟大的毛泽东思想威力无比。他们说：“不信天，不信地，一心信仰毛主席！”
    如今，到邢台一带，无论是大镇小村，到处可以看到人们无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜我们伟大领袖的情景。他们说：“世上再亲的人也没有毛主席亲”，“毛主席的恩情永远也报答不完。”他们家里贴着毛主席像，两边写着：“红心跟着共产党，万代不忘毛主席。”有个叫王仁成的五好民兵，在家里自制了一块语录板，上面写着：“语录黑板屋里挂，好像主席到我家。主席说啥就做啥，子子孙孙要听他老人家的话。”
    不信天，不信地，一心信仰毛主席，灾区人民纷纷起来撕神像，捣神龛，横扫旧风俗、旧习惯。有个叫梁小莲的老大娘，读了毛主席的书，把多年供奉的菩萨骂了一顿，说：“我供奉你几十年，给你烧了多少香，叩了多少头，你这个坏东西，你给俺什么好，什么恩？还是毛主席，一遭灾就派人来救了我，毛主席才是咱们的大救星！”贫农社员王洪章，听过部队宣讲毛主席“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义”的教导，把供奉多年的财神爷，一手撕下来，贴上毛主席像，还写上一副对联：“一心不忘共产党，万代不忘毛主席”，横批写：“永不忘本”。
    邢台地区在发生着翻天覆地的变化。人们在大破旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，代之而起的是活学活用毛主席著作成风。贫下中农说：“世上的书，千千万，毛主席的书，俺最爱念。”白天，他们把毛主席语录板带到地头，干一会儿，学一会。晚上，又到
  “毛主席著作讲习所”，在油灯下边学边谈。他们以无比欣喜的心情，大谈在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，怎样进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，怎样建设社会主义的新农村和支援世界革命。
    一场巨大的地震灾害被征服了，这是人间的奇迹！
