Chairman Mouambi: The Chinese People Labor to Support the World Revolution

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 14—Chairman Mouambi Andre George of the National Assembly of the Congo (Brazzaville) and his wife, along with the Congolese parliamentary delegation he led, visited the Pingzhou People's Commune in Nanhai County, Guangzhou, and met with commune members. After listening to the account of poor peasant commune member Huang Zhen about her life before and after liberation, Chairman Mouambi was moved to say: "From your simple family, I see the great thoughts of humanity. This is not only about your striving to build a happy family and a great motherland, but also about your labor to support the world revolution and the struggle of oppressed peoples around the world. You have such great thoughts because you have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the policies formulated by the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao. Your policies are correct, and the Congolese people support such policies." He wished the people's commune continued prosperity.

The delegation also visited the Guangzhou Success Ping-Pong Ball Factory, a model enterprise in Guangdong Province. After the visit, Chairman Mouambi said: "Your workers are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. You have overcome one difficulty after another with your own strength, continuously improving production conditions and product quality. I wish you greater progress in the future by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works."

    穆亚比议长说：中国人民为支援世界革命而劳动
    据新华社广州十四日电　刚果（布）国民议会议长穆亚比·安德烈·乔治和夫人，以及由他率领的刚果（布）议会代表团，在广州参观了南海县平洲人民公社，访问了社员。穆亚比议长听了贫农社员黄珍介绍她解放前后的情况后感动地说：“从你们这个朴素的家庭，我看到了人类的伟大思想，这就是你们不单是努力地为建设幸福的家庭和伟大的祖国而劳动，而且为支援世界革命和支援世界上被压迫人民的斗争而劳动。你们有这样伟大的思想，是因为你们有英明的领袖毛主席和毛主席所领导的中国共产党所制订的政策。你们的政策是正确的，刚果（布）人民赞成这样的政策。”他祝愿人民公社日益繁荣昌盛。
    代表团还参观了广东省大庆式企业广州成功乒乓球厂。穆亚比议长参观后说：“你们的工人是用毛泽东思想武装起来的。你们用自己的力量，克服了一个又一个困难，使生产条件不断得到改善，产品质量不断提高。我祝愿你们今后活学活用毛主席著作取得更大的进步。”
