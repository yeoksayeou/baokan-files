The South Vietnamese people resolutely oppose the sham election farce directed by the U.S. and the puppet regime. The National Liberation Front is the true representative of the South Vietnamese people. The Vietnam People's Newspaper says the sham election will further intensify the political crisis of the puppet regime.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 11th, the "Constitutional Assembly election" staged by the U.S. and the puppet regime on the 11th was met with opposition and indifference from the people.

According to reports from Western news agencies, by midday on the 11th, only 37% of voters in the U.S.-puppet-controlled areas had cast their ballots under various forms of coercion. In Saigon and Hue, only 27% of voters participated. In two provinces, the voter turnout was even lower than 20%.

The tide of people's opposition to the sham "election" reached a new peak on the day of the farce. On the 11th, within a few hours before and after the "election" began, more than 80 incidents of attacks on U.S. and puppet facilities and personnel occurred, with 12 of these incidents taking place in the Saigon area. In recent days, anti-"election" leaflets have continued to appear in various parts of South Vietnam, and there have been incidents of tearing up "voter certificates" and attacking "polling stations" and U.S. and puppet personnel with grenades. To intimidate and suppress voters who oppose the "election," the anxious U.S. and puppet regime dispatched large numbers of puppet soldiers and police to Saigon and other "electoral districts" before the "election."

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi dated the 13th, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency issued a commentary on the 12th stating that the South Vietnamese people's boycott and public opposition to this "election" show that they do not recognize the "parliament" fabricated by the U.S. and the puppet regime.

The commentary said that for the people, this "Constitutional Assembly" has no meaning. On the land of South Vietnam, there is only one organization that can truly represent the people, and that is the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. It is the organizer and leader of the people's struggle for national liberation and the construction of a new society, and it is performing all the functions of a genuine people's government.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi dated the 13th, the Vietnam People's Newspaper issued a commentary on the 13th stating that the sham "Constitutional Assembly" fabricated by the U.S. and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky regime through the fraudulent election on September 11 is nothing more than a puppet of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky puppet regime.

The commentary of the People's Newspaper said that the U.S. imperialists attempted to use the "election" farce to ease the contradictions within the puppet regime and alleviate the prolonged political crisis, but it is this fraudulent election that has made their internal contradictions even more acute, and their political crisis is inevitably developing to a more serious stage.

    南越人民坚决反对美伪导演的伪选丑剧
    民族解放阵线是南越人民真正代表
    越《人民报》说伪选必将使傀儡集团加剧政治危机
    据新华社十一日讯　西贡消息：美伪集团十一日正式上演的“制宪议会选举”丑剧，遭到了人民群众的反对和冷落。
    据西方通讯社透露，到十一日中午为止，美伪统治区才有百分之三十七的选民在种种诱迫的情况下投了票。在西贡和顺化市，投票的选民只有百分之二十七。有两个省，参加投票的选民还低于百分之二十。
    人民反对伪“大选”的怒潮在“大选”丑剧上演当天达到了新的高峰。十一日在“选举”开始前后的几小时中，各地就先后发生了八十多起袭击美伪机构和人员的事件，其中有十二起发生在西贡地区。近日来，南越各地还不断出现反对“大选”丑剧的传单，相继发生撕毁“选民证”、用手榴弹袭击“投票站”和美伪人员的事件。为了恐吓和镇压反对“选举”的选民，惶惶不安的美伪集团在“大选”前夕向西贡和其它各“选区”增派了大批伪军警。
    据新华社河内十三日电　越南南方解放通讯社十二日发表评论指出，越南南方人民对这次“选举”进行抵制和公开反对，表明他们根本不承认美伪集团炮制出来的这个“议会”。
    评论说，对于人民来说，这个“制宪议会”没有任何意义。在南方土地上，只有一个唯一真正可以代表人民的组织，这就是越南南方民族解放阵线，它是南方人民进行救国抗战和建设新社会的组织者和领导者，它正在履行真正属于人民的国家政权的一切职能。
    据新华社河内十三日电　越南《人民报》十三日发表评论指出，美国和阮文绍—阮高其集团通过九月十一日的欺诈选举而炮制出来的伪“制宪议会”，只不过是阮文绍—阮高其傀儡集团的傀儡而已。
    《人民报》的评论说，美帝国主义企图通过“选举”丑剧来缓和走狗集团内部的矛盾，缓和持久的政治危机，但就是这一欺诈的选举，使它们的内部矛盾变得更加尖锐，它们的政治危机不可避免地将进一步发展到更加严重的地步。
