The leader of the Ceylon National Liberation Front, Basil de Silva, told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led by the Chinese Communist Party and the most beloved leader of the Chinese people, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, "is a great movement to sweep away the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left behind by the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, and to establish the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat. It is a new and deeper, broader stage in the development of the socialist revolution in China."

He praised the "Decision Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," personally drafted by Chairman Mao Zedong, as a historic document of world significance, "a document that all revolutionaries should study and understand."

He pointed out that what the Chinese people are doing in this revolution today is precisely what the proletariat of the whole world will have to do in their advance toward socialism. He said: "We revolutionary people will not be deceived by the propaganda and anti-China slanders of the imperialists and revisionists. On the contrary, we fully understand and fully support the Chinese people and their Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

    锡兰民族解放阵线负责人说
    一切革命派都要学习十六条
    锡兰民族解放阵线负责人巴西尔·德席尔瓦向新华社记者发表谈话说，由中国共产党和中国人民最敬爱的领袖、当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东亲自领导的无产阶级文化革命，“是一场横扫资产阶级和其他剥削阶级遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗和旧习惯，大立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗和新习惯的大运动。”“是中国社会主义革命发展的一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。”
    他赞扬由毛泽东主席亲自主持制定的《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》是一个具有世界重要意义的历史性文件，“是一切革命派都应当学习和领会的文件。”
    他指出，中国人民今天在这场革命中所做的，正是全世界无产阶级将来在他们向社会主义前进时要做的。他说：“我们革命人民决不会被帝国主义者和修正主义者的宣传和反华污蔑所欺骗。相反，我们完全理解和完全支持中国人民和他们的无产阶级文化大革命。”
