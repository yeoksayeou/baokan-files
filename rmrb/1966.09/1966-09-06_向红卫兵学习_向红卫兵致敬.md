In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, millions of revolutionary young people, the Red Guards, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, acted as the vanguard in the charge, stood at the forefront of the struggle, and created great achievements for the revolution. Your fearless revolutionary spirit and actions of daring to charge, daring to fight, daring to make revolution, and daring to rebel are excellent! This is a great encouragement and inspiration to us. I salute you and learn from you! I resolutely support your revolutionary actions and pledge to be your strong backing!

Chairman Mao said: "In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people, there are various fronts, among which we can also say there are two fronts, military and cultural, that is, the cultural front and the military front." We are the closest comrades on these two fronts, both armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the greatest leader Mao Zedong is our supreme commander and great helmsman. We all love to read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will strike; we launch a general offensive against all ghosts and monsters, and fiercely attack the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. From a poor child, I grew up to be a Communist Party member and a revolutionary soldier, all thanks to the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. My home is not far from Chairman Mao's former residence. When I was in elementary school, my teacher took us to visit Chairman Mao's former residence and listened to Old Man Mao Yueqiu tell stories about Chairman Mao's revolution. Old Man Mao Yueqiu earnestly told us, "Children, when you grow up, you must listen to Chairman Mao's words and make revolution with Chairman Mao, so that all poor people in the world can live a good life."

In 1960, I was enlisted and came to the army. Just then, Comrade Lin Biao issued the call: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." These words struck my heart. I read every day, studied with questions, practiced what I learned, combined learning with practice, and worked hard on application. The more I studied, the broader my mind became, the brighter my eyes became, the firmer my stand became, and the stronger my will became. Mao Zedong Thought guided me to overcome one difficulty after another. I deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is the sunshine and rain for the growth and progress of our young generation. To make revolution, to struggle, and to serve the people wholeheartedly, we must master Mao Zedong Thought.

The essence of Mao Zedong Thought is critical and revolutionary. Its basic point is to criticize, to struggle, and to make revolution. Only by learning in struggle and using in struggle can we truly master Mao Zedong Thought. The current Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a fierce class struggle and is also the best and most lively classroom for us to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively. The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao is the great program for the Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must study the "Sixteen Points" seriously in this struggle, familiarize ourselves with the "Sixteen Points," master the "Sixteen Points," and use the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon to thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and establish Mao Zedong Thought. We must regard Chairman Mao's instructions as the guiding principle for all our actions and implement them resolutely. Whatever is in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, we will implement it resolutely. Whatever is against Chairman Mao's instructions, we will oppose it resolutely. Our heads may be cut off, and our blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought must not be abandoned. We must forever be loyal to the Party, loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to the people's revolutionary cause.

Revolutionary young people, heroic Red Guards, let us join hands, raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite and fight, and carry the Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    向红卫兵学习  向红卫兵致敬
    广州部队某部政治指导员　黄祖示
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，千千万万的革命青少年，红卫兵小将们，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，充当了冲锋陷阵的急先锋，站在斗争的最前列，为革命创建了伟大的功勋。你们这种天不怕，地不怕，敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的大无畏的革命精神和革命行动好得很！这对我们是一个极大的鼓舞和鞭策。我向你们致敬，向你们学习！最坚决地支持你们的革命行动，誓作你们的坚强后盾！
    毛主席说：“在我们为中国人民解放的斗争中，有各种的战线，就中也可以说有文武两个战线，这就是文化战线和军事战线。”我们是这两个战线最亲密的战友，都是用毛泽东思想武装起来的红色卫兵，最伟大的领袖毛主席是我们的最高司令和伟大统帅。我们大家都最爱读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话。毛主席指到哪里，我们就打到哪里，向一切牛鬼蛇神发起总攻击，向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯猛烈开火，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。我由一个穷孩子，成长为共产党员，革命战士，全靠毛泽东思想的哺育。我家和毛主席的旧居相距不远，上小学时，老师领我们参观毛主席的旧居，听毛月秋老爷爷讲毛主席闹革命的故事。毛月秋老爷爷语重心长地对我们说：“孩子们，你们长大以后，一定要好好听毛主席的话，跟毛主席一块闹革命，让天下穷人都过好日子。”
    一九六○年，我应征入伍，来到部队，刚好林彪同志发出号召：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”这些话句句说到我心坎里。我天天读，带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，在用字上狠下功夫，越学胸怀越开阔，眼睛越明亮，立场越坚定，意志越坚强。毛泽东思想指引我战胜了一个又一个困难。我深深地体会到，毛泽东思想是我们年青一代成长进步的阳光雨露，要革命，要斗争，要全心全意为人民服务，必须掌握毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东思想的本质是批判的、革命的。它的基本点就是要批判，要斗争，要革命。只有在斗争中学，在斗争中用，才能真正把毛泽东思想学到手。当前的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场激烈的阶级斗争，也是我们活学活用毛泽东思想最大最好最活的课堂。毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大纲领，我们要在这场斗争中认真学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条，以十六条为武器，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想。我们要把毛主席的指示，当作一切行动的指针，坚决贯彻执行。凡是符合毛主席指示的，我们就坚决照办。凡是违背毛主席指示的，我们就坚决反对。头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢。我们要永远忠于党，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于人民的革命事业。
    革命的青少年们，英雄的红卫兵小将们，让我们携起手来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结战斗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
