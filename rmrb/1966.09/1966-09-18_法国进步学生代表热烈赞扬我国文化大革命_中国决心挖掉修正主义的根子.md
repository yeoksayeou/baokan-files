    法国进步学生代表热烈赞扬我国文化大革命
    中国决心挖掉修正主义的根子
    新华社巴黎十六日电  不久前访问中国的法中友好协会大学生委员会代表团团长比埃尔·比涅奥说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命将使全世界革命人民更加坚定地反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义。这场文化大革命是在毛泽东思想指导下进行的，毛泽东是当代的列宁。
    比涅奥是在正在法国访问的中国学生代表团十五日同法中友好协会大学生委员会代表团举行联欢时讲这番话的。
    在这个洋溢着热情和友谊的联欢会上，比涅奥谈到了代表团访问中国的观感。他说，“我们很荣幸能在中国进行文化大革命的时候访问中国。我们完全同意中国的文化大革命，这场大革命就是要挖掉修正主义的根子，挖掉资本主义复辟的根子。”
    他在讲话结束时高呼：“中国共产党万岁！光荣的红卫兵万岁！毛泽东主席万岁！”这时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。
    中国学生代表团团长也在会上讲话。他在讲话结束时高呼：“马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！法国的马克思列宁主义者万岁！巴黎公社精神万岁！”这时，全场再次起立，热烈鼓掌。
    前来法国参加第十四届国际大学生文化联欢节的中国学生代表团，在联欢会上表演了歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席的歌舞节目，受到法国朋友的热烈欢迎。
    联欢会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
