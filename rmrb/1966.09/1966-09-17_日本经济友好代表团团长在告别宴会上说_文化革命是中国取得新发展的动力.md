The head of the Japanese Economic Friendship Delegation, Kuniwaki Katsunobu, spoke at a farewell banquet, saying: "The Cultural Revolution in China is a great innovation and is the driving force for China's new developments in all aspects. It will also bring good results to Sino-Japanese trade."

Kuniwaki also stated, "The greatest obstacles to world peace and the development of Sino-Japanese trade relations are the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism and the Sato government's policy of following American imperialism in its hostility towards China." He expressed his determination to firmly uphold the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship and resolutely struggle against these obstacles and disruptions.

Nan Hanqing, in his speech, pointed out that in order to develop friendly and trade relations between the peoples of China and Japan, economic and trade organizations and individuals from both countries must strengthen their friendly unity and jointly strive against American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and all their various new and old followers.

Liao Chengzhi said in his speech, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being successfully carried out in China will also help to further promote the development of friendly relations and economic and trade exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan."

    据新华社十六日讯  日本国际贸易促进协会经济友好代表团今晚举行告别宴会。中日友好协会会长廖承志、中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸、中国人民外交学会副会长胡愈之等应邀出席宴会。
    代表团团长国分胜范在宴会上讲话，他说：“中国的文化大革命是一个伟大的创举，是中国在一切方面新发展的原动力，并将对日中贸易带来良好的结果。”国分还说：“世界和平和发展日中贸易关系的最大障碍是美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策，以及佐藤政府追随美帝国主义敌视中国的政策。”他表示，决心高举日中友好的旗帜对这些障碍和破坏进行坚决的斗争。
    南汉宸在讲话中指出，为了发展中日两国人民之间的友好和贸易关系，中日两国经济贸易团体和人士必须加强友好团结，为反对美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联修正主义领导集团及其形形色色的新旧追随者而共同奋斗。
