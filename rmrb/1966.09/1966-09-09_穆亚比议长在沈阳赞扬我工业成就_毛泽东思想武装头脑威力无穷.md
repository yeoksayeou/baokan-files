A delegation from the Congolese (Brazzaville) National Assembly spent three days in Shenyang, visiting and touring various locations. Muabi Andre George, the Speaker of the National Assembly, and other Congolese dignitaries praised China's significant achievements in industrial construction, attributing these successes to the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

During their stay in Shenyang, the dignitaries visited numerous factories, including mechanical and textile plants, and toured the coal city of Fushun. After visiting the Shenyang Cable Factory and the Shenyang Woolen Mill, they expressed admiration for Chinese workers' active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, their use of Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, and their spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. Muabi remarked, "Your achievements are a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

At the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant, the dignitaries listened to an introduction and saw firsthand the machine tools produced by the Chinese people to support the Congolese people's struggle for national independence. They were excited to learn that these machine tools would soon be sent to their country. Muabi said, "We are very grateful for your support. We wish you greater achievements under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Long live the friendship between the peoples of Congo (Brazzaville) and China!"

In the Shenyang Small Tractor Factory, the Congolese dignitaries praised, "Your ability to design and manufacture tractors needed by farmers is a result of Chairman Mao's wise leadership."

In the coal city of Fushun, after visiting the Fushun Petroleum Plant, Muabi told the plant's leaders and workers, "Here, we not only see various high-quality products but also witness the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle among Chinese workers under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought." He wished China's industrial construction even greater achievements.

The delegation arrived in Shenyang on the 4th and departed this morning by special plane for Nanjing to continue their visit and tour.

	Mao Zedong's works spread far and wide, every word and sentence shines with gold; revolutionaries see them and their hearts are filled with joy, while enemies see them and their hearts tremble. The photo shows Congolese (Brazzaville) youth eagerly reading Chairman Mao's works.
