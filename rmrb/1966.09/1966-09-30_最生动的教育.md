To the entire Heroic Drilling Team:

When we heard from the radio about your heroic deeds of saving national property and extinguishing the gas well fire, we were all deeply inspired and filled with boundless admiration. Tears of emotion welled up in our eyes. From you, we see the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought and the courage, selflessness, tenacity, and combat effectiveness of those armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We have received the most vivid education in Mao Zedong Thought.

We are geologists conducting coal field surveys in the border region of Inner Mongolia. We are determined to take you as our example, to learn from the heroes' thoughts, and to follow the heroes' path, finding more coal for the construction of socialism. Finally, we salute you with the highest revolutionary respect.

    最生动的教育三二一一一英雄钻井队全体同志：
    当我们从收音机里，听到你们为抢救国家财产，扑灭气井大火的惊天动地的英雄事迹以后，我们每一个人都感到无限鼓舞，无限敬仰，被感动得热泪满眶。从你们身上，我们看到伟大的毛泽东思想的无比威力，看到用毛泽东思想武装起来的人最勇敢、最无私、最顽强、最具有战斗力。我们受到了一次最生动的毛泽东思想的教育。
    我们是在祖国边疆内蒙古进行煤田普查的地质队员，我们决心以你们为榜样，学英雄的思想，走英雄的道路，为社会主义建设找出更多的煤。最后向你们致以最崇高的革命敬礼。
          河北省煤矿管理局地质勘探公司普查队全体革命职工
