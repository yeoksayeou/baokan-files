	Xining Develops a Winch-Type Bulldozer

	The Xining Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory in Qinghai Province recently successfully developed a winch-type bulldozer suitable for Qinghai's agricultural land construction. It has now officially entered production. This bulldozer is installed on the Dongfanghong-54 type tractor and includes components such as a bulldozer blade and a winch. It can both plow the land and level the land, thereby expanding the range of tractor applications. This bulldozer can level three mu (approximately 0.2 hectares) of land in eight hours and can push 220 cubic meters of soil, with relatively low fuel consumption.

	Qinghai's rural mountainous areas have a large area of cultivated land. With this bulldozer, it will greatly aid in Qinghai Province's agricultural land construction work.

    西宁制成绞盘式推土机
    青海省西宁农业机械修理厂，最近试制成功一种适用于青海农田基本建设的绞盘式推土机，并已正式投入生产。这种推土机安装在东方红—54型拖拉机上，它包括推土铲、绞盘等部件，既可翻耕土地，又可平整土地，从而扩大了拖拉机的使用范围。这种推土机八小时可平整土地三亩多，推土二百二十多方，耗油量也较小。
    青海农村山区耕地面积很大，有了这种推土机，就将大大有助于青海省的农田基本建设工作。
