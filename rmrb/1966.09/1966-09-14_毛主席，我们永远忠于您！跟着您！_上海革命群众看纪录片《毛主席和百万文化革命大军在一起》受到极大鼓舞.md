The documentary film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army Together" has been shown in Shanghai since the 12th, bringing new and immense spiritual strength to the revolutionary masses of Shanghai, inspiring them to continue to advance bravely and vow to achieve greater victories in the proletarian cultural revolution.

On this day, more than forty movie theaters and workers' clubs in Shanghai simultaneously screened this film, with over three hundred thousand revolutionary masses enjoying the happiness of being with Chairman Mao on screen with their revolutionary comrades. When the red sun accompanied by the majestic melody of "The East Is Red" burst forth on the screen, and our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, appeared among the million revolutionary masses with a radiant demeanor, countless pairs of eyes filled with tears of joy gazed at Chairman Mao, and countless hearts, filled with excitement, soared towards Tiananmen Square. The people, together with the million revolutionary masses in front of Tiananmen Square, shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" in unison.

The workers of Shanghai, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, and the poor and lower-middle peasants of the suburbs, after watching this film, were too excited to calm down for a long time. They held meetings, discussed, and wrote articles to express their feelings. The workers of Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill, which Chairman Mao had inspected, saw on the screen the moving scene of Chairman Mao standing hand in hand with the revolutionary masses. They said with particular excitement: We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations. We will definitely unite with revolutionary students under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the old world, and build a new world! The 67-year-old chairman of the poor peasants' association, Lu Adi, of Liziyuan Brigade, Taopu Commune, Jiading County, saw Chairman Mao waving to the masses in the film. He shouted with all his might to Chairman Mao. He said excitedly: Ten years ago, it was Chairman Mao who, in the book "Socialist High Tide in China's Countryside," wrote a comment on an article introducing our Liziyuan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative. For ten years, we have followed Chairman Mao's instructions every moment. The collective economy has been continuously consolidated, and agricultural production has been continuously developed. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, will be loyal to Chairman Mao forever and follow Chairman Mao to make revolution forever.

The soldiers of the PLA stationed in Shanghai watched the film and were overjoyed. The soldiers of the "Good Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" said: Chairman Mao wears the same military uniform as we do. This is our greatest honor and the greatest trust and expectation Chairman Mao has for us. Although Chairman Mao is thousands of miles away from us, after watching the film, it feels as if Chairman Mao is by our side. We must always listen to Chairman Mao's words, and in the current complex class struggle, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly guard our battle positions, and resolutely, together with the broad masses of workers and peasants, together with the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary students, after watching the film, felt as if they were in the midst of the bustling Tiananmen Square, and they themselves had flown to Chairman Mao's side. They made a vow: Chairman Mao, we will forever be loyal to you with red hearts! The Red Guards of Shanghai First Medical College, who had just returned from seeing Chairman Mao in Beijing, said excitedly: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You care for us young people the most and support our revolutionary actions the most. We will definitely follow your words and act according to the sixteen points you personally presided over, learn from the PLA, and strive to train ourselves into the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause that you expect.

    毛主席，我们永远忠于您！跟着您！
    上海革命群众看纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》受到极大鼓舞
    据新华社上海十三日电　大型彩色纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》，十二日起在上海放映，给上海广大革命群众带来了新的巨大的精神力量，激励他们继续奋勇前进，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的更大胜利。
    这一天，上海四十多家电影院、工人俱乐部同时放映这部影片，共有三十多万革命群众和在银幕上的革命战友一起共享了同毛主席在一起的幸福。当银幕上一轮红日伴着《东方红》的雄伟乐曲声，喷薄而出，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席身穿军服，神采奕奕来到百万革命群众中间的时候，无数双含着幸福泪花的眼睛凝视着毛主席，无数颗激动的心，飞向天安门广场，人们同天安门广场前的百万革命群众同声高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”同声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    具有光荣革命斗争传统的上海工人和郊区的贫农下中农，在观看这部电影以后，激动的心情久久不能平静。他们纷纷集会座谈，写文章，表达自己的心情。毛主席曾经视察过的上海国棉一厂工人，从银幕上看到毛主席同革命群众手挽着手站在一起的动人情景，怀着格外激动的心情说：我们决不辜负毛主席的期望，一定要在毛泽东思想伟大旗帜下和革命学生团结起来，彻底批判旧世界，建设新世界！嘉定县桃浦公社李子园大队六十七岁的贫协主席陆阿弟在影片中看到毛主席向群众挥手致意，他用尽全身的劲对着毛主席欢呼。他激动地说：十年前，是毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中，为介绍我们李子园农业生产合作社的一篇文章写过按语。十年来，我们时时刻刻遵照毛主席的指示办事，集体经济不断巩固，农业生产不断发展。我们贫下中农子孙万代永远忠于毛主席，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。
    人民解放军驻沪部队的指战员观看了影片，欢欣若狂。“南京路上好八连”战士们说：毛主席和我们一样穿着军装，这是我们最大的光荣，是对我们最大的信任和期望。毛主席虽然和我们远隔千里，但看了影片，毛主席就好像在我们身边。我们一定要永远听毛主席的话，在当前复杂的阶级斗争中，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚守战斗岗位，坚决同广大工农群众一起，同红卫兵和革命师生一起，在毛主席领导下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    广大红卫兵和革命师生看了影片，仿佛置身在热火朝天的天安门广场上，自己也飞到了毛主席身边。他们立下志愿：毛主席，我们永远赤胆忠心跟着您！刚在北京见到了毛主席归来的上海第一医学院红卫兵小将们激动地说：毛主席啊！毛主席！您老人家最最关心我们青年，最最支持我们的革命行动。我们一定听您的话，按您亲自主持制定的十六条办事，向解放军学习，努力把自己锻炼培养成您所期望的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
