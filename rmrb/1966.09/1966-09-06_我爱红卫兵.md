I love the Red Guards. The Red Guards are the reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

I love the Red Guards. The Red Guards are bold and strategic. In just a few days, they have swept away the "four olds" with a revolutionary broom, and knocked down the arrogance of the exploiting classes with a revolutionary hammer. The Red Guards have done well! We wholeheartedly support them.

To make a revolution, one must be bold and strategic, and be both wise and courageous.

Think back to when we poor and lower-middle peasants were fighting for land reform and liberation. First and foremost, we were fearless—fearless of the landlords, fearless of the rich peasants, fearless of "reactionary changes." If you are afraid of this and that, you can't talk about making a revolution. Why were we fearless? Because we had the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao Zedong backing us up, and because we had the strength of the poor and lower-middle peasants' organizations. Today, our great leader Chairman Mao is the supreme commander of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With Chairman Mao leading us, we fear nothing. We fear no one who takes the capitalist road while in power, no reactionary authorities of the bourgeoisie, no ghosts and monsters, no obstacles. We must be the bravest, and fight against the rightist elements of the bourgeoisie, fight against the revisionist counter-revolutionaries, fight against all ghosts and monsters, until we fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink.

We must dare to fight, and we must know how to fight. To know how to fight, we must have good weapons and be strategic in our struggle.

Think back to when we were fighting for land reform and liberation. We followed Chairman Mao's instructions, acted according to the Land Reform Outline, firmly relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, consolidated the unity of the middle peasants, and struck at a few landlords and rich peasants, achieving great victories in land reform. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have the strongest ideological weapon, Mao Zedong Thought, and the Sixteen Points personally drafted by Chairman Mao. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions and act according to the Sixteen Points, always paying attention to class analysis, striving to develop the strength of the left, winning over the middle forces, uniting the majority, and concentrating our forces to strike at a handful of rightist elements of the bourgeoisie, clearly targeting those in power within the Party who take the capitalist road, we will surely achieve victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

I love the Red Guards. We poor and lower-middle peasants are proud to have such a generation of revolutionary successors who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to venture, and dare to make a revolution. We firmly support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. We hope that the Red Guard youths will quickly grow and become wise and courageous pioneers in the struggle, so that the ironclad rule of the proletariat will never change, and Mao Zedong Thought will be passed down for generations to come.

    我爱红卫兵
    山西昔阳县大寨大队党支部书记　陈永贵
    我爱红卫兵。红卫兵是无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    我爱红卫兵。红卫兵有勇有谋，短短的几天，用革命的扫帚把“四旧”扫得落花流水，用革命的千钧棒把一切剥削阶级的“威风”打倒在地。红卫兵干得好！我们双手赞成。
    干革命，就得有勇有谋，智勇双全。
    想当年，我们贫下中农在搞土改闹翻身的时候，首先是不怕，不怕地主，不怕富农，不怕“变天”。怕这怕那，就根本说不上革命。为什么不怕？因为有党中央和毛主席给我们撑腰作主，有贫下中农组织的力量。今天我们伟大的领袖毛主席是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大统帅，有毛主席给我们作主，我们什么也不怕。不怕走资本主义道路的当权派，不怕资产阶级的反动权威，不怕一切牛鬼蛇神，不怕一切阻力。要有最大的勇敢，和资产阶级右派分子斗，和反革命修正主义分子斗，和一切牛鬼蛇神斗，直到把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    要敢于斗，还要善于斗。要善于斗，就得有好武器，讲究斗争策略。
    想当年，在搞土改闹翻身的时候，我们听毛主席的话，按土地法大纲办事，坚决依靠贫下中农，巩固地团结中农，打击少数地主、富农，取得了土地改革的伟大胜利。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们有毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，有毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条。只要我们听毛主席的话，照十六条办事，时刻注意用阶级分析的方法，努力发展左派力量，争取中间力量，团结大多数，集中力量打击一小撮资产阶级右派分子，明确打击的重点是钻进党内走资本主义道路的当权派，就一定能够取得无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    我爱红卫兵。我们贫下中农为有这样一代敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的革命接班人而骄傲。我们坚决支持红卫兵的革命行动。我们希望红卫兵小将们，在斗争中迅速成长起来，成为智勇双全的闯将，使无产阶级的铁打江山永不变色，让毛泽东思想千秋万代永远传下去。
