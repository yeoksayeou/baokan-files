One day, a rural woman came to Kunming to buy traditional Chinese medicine. She was missing one ingredient and couldn't complete her prescription. A worker at the People's Pharmacy looked at the prescription and knew that the woman was suffering from postpartum hemorrhage, a serious condition. The missing ingredient was out of stock. What to do? Should they just say they didn't have it? No. He thought, to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, one must do everything possible to solve the people's difficulties. He rushed to the warehouse, searched through every box and drawer, and carefully cleaned them all. Finally, he managed to complete the prescription for the customer.

This is just one of many small stories that happened at the People's Pharmacy in Kunming during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The People's Pharmacy was originally named "Fulin Hall," a shop owned by a capitalist named Li Fulin. Before liberation, this pharmacy mainly sold expensive medicines like deer antler and ginseng, serving only bureaucrats, landlords, and the bourgeoisie. After liberation, the shop was returned to the people, but the old name "Fulin Hall," which still carried the stench of the bourgeoisie, remained unchanged.

On August 23, the Red Guards posted a big-character poster at "Fulin Hall," demanding a name change to better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to improve service attitudes. This poster was enthusiastically supported by the revolutionary workers of the pharmacy. They removed the old "Fulin Hall" sign and replaced it with four bright red characters: "People's Pharmacy." That evening, the revolutionary workers cleaned all the medicine containers, erasing the "Fulin Hall" characters and removing all the feudalistic images of immortals and talented scholars painted on them. They hung up portraits of Chairman Mao and his quotations, making the entire pharmacy look brand new.

Following this, the workers held a discussion. Everyone said that while the old sign was removed, there were still many "four olds" left within the pharmacy, such as the previous practice of stocking more expensive supplements and fewer common medicines, and the preference for selling more expensive medicines while avoiding the hassle of selling single, inexpensive medicines. These old thoughts and habits must be thoroughly eliminated. Some workers also suggested that the pharmacy should face towards workers, peasants, and soldiers, and think more about the farmers, patiently helping them select medicines and explaining how to take them.

After the discussion, everyone quickly got to work. Within a few days, the store had increased its stock of commonly used medicines; customers could buy single medicines, even if they only cost a few cents. For farmers who traveled far and for seriously ill patients, medicines were prioritized. Customers who came to buy medicine at night were served immediately.

    新店名  新风尚
    一天，一位农村妇女到昆明市抓中药，缺一味药配不齐。人民药店一位职工看了药方，知道这位妇女患产后流血症，病情严重。缺的那味药，最近缺货。怎么办呢？回答没有就算了吗？不行。他想，要“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，就得尽最大努力解决群众的困难。他跑到仓库里，翻箱倒柜，把装过这种药的抽屉都拿出来，细细地清扫了一遍，终于给这位顾客配齐了这付药。
    这是昆明市人民药店在无产阶级文化大革命中发生的许多小故事之一。
    人民药店原名“福林堂”，过去是一个叫李福林的资本家开设的。解放前，这家药店以卖鹿茸、人参等高贵药品为主，专门为官僚、地主和资产阶级老爷太太们服务。解放后，这个店回到了人民的手里，但散发着资产阶级臭味的“福林堂”这个旧店名仍然没有改。
    八月二十三日，红卫兵给“福林堂”贴了一张大字报，要他们更改店名，面向工农兵，改进服务态度。这张大字报得到药店革命职工的热烈支持，他们把“福林堂”这块旧招牌去掉，换上了“人民药店”四个鲜红的大字。当天晚上，革命职工把装药用的家什清理了一遍，把上面刻着的“福林堂”三个字统统铲掉，把瓷罐上画着封建主义色彩的寿星和才子佳人，全部涂掉；在墙上贴上了毛主席像和毛主席语录，整个药店焕然一新。
    接着，职工们又开了讨论会。大家说，旧招牌除掉了，但是药店内部还有许多剥削阶级留下的“四旧”，例如过去药店进贵重补药多，一般治疗药少；愿意多卖价格贵的药，对于卖一两分钱的单味药嫌麻烦，这些旧思想、旧习惯都必须彻底改掉。有的职工还提出，药店应当面向工农兵，多为农民着想，要耐心帮助他们选购药品和介绍服药办法。
    讨论后，大家很快动起手来。几天之内，店里就增加了大量的常用药；顾客来买单味药，一分钱的也卖。对远道来的农民和重病人，优先配药。顾客夜晚买药，随叫随卖。　（滇仁）
