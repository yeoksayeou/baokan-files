Edition: 6

Lin Mo-han has consistently resisted Chairman Mao's criticism of the bourgeois literary line of the 1930s, represented by Zhou Yang. He has plotted to rehabilitate the literary black line of the 1930s. As late as November 19, 1965 (the ninth day after the Shanghai *Wenhui Bao* published Comrade Yao Wen-yuan's "On the New Historical Drama *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*"), he still said at a meeting convened to discuss editorial work, "We should summarize the experiences of the 1930s and study the evaluation of the 1930s," and added, "This article can probably only be written by Comrade Zhou Yang." He then issued orders saying, "Do not criticize Xia Yan's *The Story of Ah Q*, leave some room."

However, this year in March, Lin Mo-han suddenly rushed to hand over to the *Literary Gazette* an article supposedly "criticizing" *The Story of Ah Q*, claiming that this article criticizes *The Story of Ah Q* from a new angle and must be published.

Why is this?

In early February this year, the People's Liberation Army held a symposium on literary work in the army. At this meeting, it was pointed out that since the founding of the nation, there has been a black line in the literary world that combines bourgeois literary thought, modern revisionist literary thought, and the so-called literature of the 1930s, which is anti-party and anti-socialist. It was pointed out that "National Defense Literature" is a bourgeois slogan, and *The Story of Ah Q* is precisely the model drama praised by the Zhou Yang clique as the pioneer of "National Defense Drama." Seeing the situation, Lin Mo-han panicked and made various arrangements to resist stubbornly. This cunning capitalist-roader in power ordered the *Literary Gazette* to publish Deng Shao-ji's article "Criticizing *The Story of Ah Q*" (see the fourth issue of the *Literary Gazette* in 1966), intending to deceive the central authorities and the masses, engaging in pseudo-criticism and real resistance. The article "*The Story of Ah Q*'s Reactionary Content and Its Implications," which was carefully revised by Lin Mo-han, is a thoroughly poisonous weed. This article openly defends Xia Yan, saying that Xia Yan's motive for writing *The Story of Ah Q* was good. It says, "We are willing to believe in Comrade Xia Yan's good subjective intentions"; it wants people to view *The Story of Ah Q* in a dialectical manner, saying, "From certain parts of the *The Story of Ah Q* script, Comrade Xia Yan describes the incompetence and treachery of the officials of the Qing government led by Li Hongzhang, exposing the rottenness and humiliating diplomatic policies of the Qing government." This article not only confuses the bourgeois and revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang with the proletarian literary line represented by Lu Xun, quoting Zhou Yang extensively to summarize the literary movement of the 1930s as a classic, thereby covering up Zhou Yang's errors, but also ends the article by writing, "We hope that Comrades Tian Han, Xia Yan, and Yang Han-sheng can thoroughly criticize their own mistakes and, together with the broad masses of literary workers, contribute to the revolutionary literary cause of our country along the great path of Mao Zedong's literature." Perhaps because this statement is too blatant, it was deleted before publication.

It is now clear that Lin Mo-han's so-called article criticizing *The Story of Ah Q* from a new angle is actually a new anti-party and anti-socialist angle. His intention to publish this poisonous weed is to sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution, to protect his master, cover up his accomplices, and cover himself, and to preserve revolutionary forces in every possible way, attempting to rise again.

### 林默涵包庇《赛金花》

    林默涵包庇《赛金花》
    林默涵一贯抗拒毛主席对三十年代以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺路线的批判，阴谋为三十年代文艺黑线翻案。直至去年十一月十九日（即上海《文汇报》发表姚文元同志的《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》的第九天），他在召集报刊负责人研究评论工作的会议上还说：“要好好总结一下三十年代，研究一下关于三十年代的经验和估价问题”，并说：“这文章恐怕只有周扬同志才能写了。”接着又发号施令说：“夏衍的《赛金花》不要批了，要留点余地。”
    但是，今年三月，林默涵却突然匆忙地塞给《文艺报》一篇所谓“批判”《赛金花》的文章，说什么这篇文章是从新的角度批判《赛金花》，一定要发。
    这是为什么？
    今年二月初，解放军召开了部队文艺工作座谈会。在这个会上，指出了建国以来文艺界存在着一条资产阶级文艺思想、现代修正主义文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺相结合的反党反社会主义的黑线，指出“国防文学”是资产阶级口号，而《赛金花》正是被周扬一伙捧为“国防戏剧”的首创“样板”。林默涵见势不妙，慌了手脚，便多方部署，负隅顽抗。这个狡诈的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，命令《文艺报》发表邓绍基写的“批判”《赛金花》的文章（见一九六六年第四期《文艺报》），就是为了蒙蔽中央，欺骗群众，搞假批判、真抗拒。《〈赛金花〉的反动内容说明了什么？》这篇经过林默涵精心修改的文章，是一株彻头彻尾的大毒草。这篇文章公然为夏衍辩护，说夏衍写《赛金花》的动机是好的。他说什么“我们愿意相信夏衍同志的良好的主观用意”；要人们对《赛金花》也要一分为二，说什么“从《赛金花》剧本中的某些部分来看，夏衍同志是描写了以李鸿章为首的清朝政府的大臣们的无能和卖国，暴露了清朝政府的腐朽和屈辱的外交政策。”这篇文章，不但把以周扬为代表的资产阶级、修正主义文艺路线与以鲁迅为代表的无产阶级文艺路线混淆起来，长篇累牍地大引周扬的话，把周扬的话作为总结三十年代文艺运动的经典，从而掩盖周扬的错误，而且在文章的结尾，竟然这样写道：“我们希望，田汉、夏衍和阳翰笙等同志能够彻底批判自己的错误，和广大文艺工作者一道，沿着伟大毛泽东文艺方向，为我国的革命文艺事业，贡献出我们能够贡献的一切。”大概因为这句话说得太露骨，所以在临发表时被删掉了。
    现在非常清楚了，林默涵所谓这篇文章从新的角度批判了《赛金花》，实际上是一种反党反社会主义的新角度。他要发这株毒草的目的，就是要破坏无产阶级文化大革命，就是要保护他的主子，包庇他的帮凶和掩护他自己，千方百计地保存反革命力量，妄图东山再起。
