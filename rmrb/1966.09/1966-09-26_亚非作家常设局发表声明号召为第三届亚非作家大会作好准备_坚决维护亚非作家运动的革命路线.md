	Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau Issues Statement Calling for Preparations for the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference and Resolutely Defending the Revolutionary Line of the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement
	Afro-Asian Progressive Writers Must Thoroughly Smash the Plot of the Soviet Revisionist Group to Hold a Fake "Third Conference"
	New China News Agency, September 25th

	The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau today issued a statement in Beijing entitled "Defend the Revolutionary Line of the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement and Thoroughly Smash the Sabotage Activities of Soviet Revisionism."

	The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Since the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement was established eight years ago, it has consistently opposed all tendencies that deviate from its original stance as a fighting organization of the Afro-Asian peoples against imperialism and colonialism, striving for and safeguarding national independence, and developing national culture, literature, and traditions.

	Over the past few years, the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement has had to wage a sharp struggle against the attempt by the Soviet Writers' Union to lead the movement astray. The Soviet Writers' Union, following its government's political line of revisionism, betrayed its original anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist stance and began to collaborate completely with the imperialists and colonialists.

	The leadership body of the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement—the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau—has exerted its utmost efforts to successfully resist the erroneous tendencies that have infiltrated the movement.

	The Soviet revisionist writers, who have been relentlessly engaged in nefarious activities, finally realized that the fighting Afro-Asian Writers' Movement would not allow their capitulationist line to exist. On the extremely important issue concerning writers and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the whole world—namely, the issue of supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression—they took self-destructive actions. Thus, they finally severed themselves from the fighting Afro-Asian Writers' Movement in June.

	The Soviet revisionist writers not only ignored the Permanent Bureau's decision to convene an emergency meeting to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression but also, in line with their government's policy of not opposing U.S. imperialism, adopted a political line of peaceful coexistence with U.S. imperialism, attempting to sabotage this meeting.

	Their first self-destructive step was to try to split the Permanent Bureau through a schismatic meeting they orchestrated in Cairo in June. This meeting met with a resounding failure.

	Due to the exposure and severe condemnation of the Soviet revisionist writers' nefarious activities in Cairo by the representatives of 53 Afro-Asian countries (regions) and 5 Afro-Asian international organizations attending the Beijing meeting, they plotted another conspiracy in Baku in August. Perhaps their aim was to cover up their naked face after refusing to participate in the Beijing emergency meeting to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression, but the Baku schismatic meeting also met with a miserable failure.

	The more they tried to cover up, the more they exposed themselves; the more they were exposed, the more they tried to cover up. In order to beg for the support of other countries to achieve their plot of holding a so-called Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference, the Soviet revisionist writers shamelessly convened a so-called Afro-Asian Writers' Executive Committee meeting. A small group of misled and uninformed individuals who attended the September 2nd Baku schismatic meeting participated in this meeting.

	The Soviet News Agency (TASS) reported on September 9, 1966, from Moscow that the splitters were plotting to hold a so-called Third Conference in Beirut, Lebanon, from February to March 1967. For this purpose, they will also convene a so-called preparatory committee meeting in Cairo this October.

	The whole world knows that the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference will be held in Beijing. This is in accordance with the decision passed by 20 out of the 23 member countries of the Executive Committee, which also received the support of 33 other Afro-Asian countries (regions) and 5 Afro-Asian international organizations. This conference, which includes the Executive Committee and is attended by 53 countries and regions, has only the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and the United Arab Republic, as member countries of the Executive Committee, not participating.

	Now, talking about another preparatory committee for the Third Conference is utterly absurd and laughable. In fact, the Executive Committee held in Bali, Indonesia, in 1963, fully discussed the preparations for the Third Conference and adopted the agenda for the Third Conference. A three-person delegation from the Soviet Union attended the Bali Executive Committee. The Executive Committee also entrusted the Permanent Bureau and the host country (Indonesia) to do all the necessary preparations for the Third Conference.

	As we pointed out in our previous statements, due to the terrorist and anti-people activities carried out by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime in Indonesia and their betrayal of the cause of the Afro-Asian peoples' anti-imperialist struggle, the writers of the host country, Indonesia, proposed to the emergency meeting held in Beijing to hold the Third Conference in China. This proposal was supported by 20 out of the 23 member countries of the Executive Committee, and 33 other Afro-Asian countries (regions) accepted this proposal. The legitimacy, effectiveness, legality, and broad representativeness of this decision are beyond doubt. The news of holding the Third Conference in China has been warmly welcomed by Afro-Asian writers and peoples.

	Therefore, talking about another preparatory committee to prepare for the Third Conference is completely contrary to the customs of our movement. Such actions are completely illegal, and all resolutions and decisions made at such meetings are invalid.

	Thus, the struggle between the fighting, progressive line of the Afro-Asian writers and peoples and the capitulationist, reactionary line of the Soviet revisionists has entered a new stage.

	To defend the revolutionary line of unity against imperialism of the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement and thoroughly smash the capitulationist line of the Soviet revisionists, the Permanent Bureau calls on all progressive Afro-Asian writers to redouble their efforts, expose their preparations for the fake preparatory committee to be held in Cairo in October and the fake "Third Conference" to be held in Beirut from February to March 1967, and smash all their despicable plots to split our ranks. We call on all progressive Afro-Asian writers to be more vigilant, strengthen the unity of our ranks, and continue our struggle with even greater fighting spirit to make further preparations for the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in China in 1967. We will raise high the banner of unity among Afro-Asian writers and the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, advancing from victory to greater victory. The fighting anti-imperialist line of our movement will surely triumph! The capitulationist line of revisionism will surely fail!

    亚非作家常设局发表声明号召为第三届亚非作家大会作好准备
    坚决维护亚非作家运动的革命路线  
    亚非进步作家必须彻底粉碎苏修集团策划的伪“三大”阴谋
    新华社二十五日讯  亚非作家常设局今天在北京发表了题为《维护亚非作家运动的革命路线，彻底粉碎苏联修正主义的分裂活动》的声明。
    声明全文如下：
    亚非作家运动产生八年以来，作为亚非人民反帝反殖、争取和维护民族独立、发展民族文化、文学和传统的一个战斗组织，一贯反对违背其原来立场的一切倾向。
    过去几年，在亚非作家运动中不得不掀起一场反对苏联作家协会企图把作家运动引向错误路线的尖锐斗争。苏联作协追随他们政府在政治上的修正主义路线，背叛了原来的反帝反殖的立场，开始走上了与帝国主义者和殖民主义者完全合作的道路。
    亚非作家运动的领导机构——亚非作家常设局尽其全力成功地抵制了暗暗钻进运动内部的错误倾向。
    千方百计在进行罪恶活动的苏联修正主义作家，最后意识到战斗的亚非作家运动绝不允许他们投降主义路线的存在，他们在关系到作家以及亚洲、非洲和全世界人民的极其重要的问题，这就是在支持越南人民反对美国侵略的问题上，采取了自取灭亡的行动。这样，他们终于在六月份自绝于战斗的亚非作家运动。
    苏联修正主义作家不仅无视常设局关于召开支持越南人民反对美国侵略的紧急会议的决定，而且还迎合他们政府不反对美帝国主义的政策，而采取与美帝国主义和平共处的政治路线，企图破坏这个会议。
    他们自取灭亡的第一步，就是企图通过他们一手制造的、六月在开罗召开的分裂会议来分裂常设局。这次会议遭到了惨败。
    由于苏联修正主义作家在开罗的罪恶活动被彻底揭露了，并且遭到出席北京会议的五十三个亚非国家（地区）和五个亚非国际组织的代表的严厉谴责，于是他们八月份在巴库又策划一个阴谋。他们这样做，目的也许是为了掩盖他们拒绝参加为支持越南人民反对美国侵略的北京紧急会议后所表现出来的赤裸裸的面目，但是巴库分裂会议也遭到了可悲失败。
    他们越是设法掩盖，就越是暴露无遗；他们越是被暴露，就越想设法掩盖。为了乞求其它国家的支持来达到召开所谓第三届亚非作家大会的另一个阴谋，苏联修正主义作家恬不知耻地召开了一次所谓的亚非作家执行委员会会议。出席九月二日巴库分裂会议的一小撮误入歧途和不明真相的人参加了这个会议。
    苏联通讯社（塔斯社）一九六六年九月九日从莫斯科报道分裂主义者正在策划一九六七年二月到三月在黎巴嫩的贝鲁特召开所谓的第三届大会。为此目的，今年十月他们还将在开罗召开一次所谓的筹备委员会。
    全世界都知道，第三届亚非作家大会将在北京召开。这是按照二十三个执委会成员国中的二十个成员国所通过的决定办事的，此决定也得到其他三十三个亚非国家和地区及五个亚非国际组织的支持。这个包括执委会在内的由五十三个国家和地区参加的大会，唯有作为执委会成员国的苏联、蒙古和阿联没有参加。
    而现在他们谈论什么第三届大会的筹备委员会是十分荒唐可笑的，事实上是：一九六三年在印度尼西亚巴厘召开的执委会充分讨论了第三届大会的准备工作，并通过了第三届大会的议程。一个由三人组成的苏联代表团曾经出席了巴厘的执委会。执委会还委托常设局和东道国（印度尼西亚）为第三届大会做一切必要的准备工作。
    正如我们在以前的声明中所指出的那样，由于目前苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事当局在印度尼西亚所进行恐怖和反人民的活动以及他们对亚非人民反帝斗争事业的背叛，东道国印度尼西亚的作家向在北京召开的紧急会议提出了在中国召开第三届大会的建议。二十三个执委会成员国中的二十个成员国支持这个建议，其他三十三个亚非国家（地区）接受了这个建议。这个决定的正规性、有效性、合法性和广泛的代表性是不容置疑的。在中国举行第三届大会的消息已经受到亚非作家和人民的热烈欢迎。
    因此，谈论另一个筹备委员会来为三大作准备是完全违背我们运动的惯例的。这种行动是完全非法的，这种会议上的一切决议、决定都是无效的。
    这样，亚非作家和人民的战斗的、进步的路线和苏联修正主义者的投降主义反动路线之间的斗争已经进入了一个新的阶段。
    为了维护亚非作家运动团结反帝的革命路线和彻底粉碎苏联修正主义者的投降路线，常设局号召所有进步的亚非作家加倍努力，揭露他们准备十月在开罗召开的伪筹委会和一九六七年二月到三月在贝鲁特召开的伪“三大”，粉碎他们分裂我们队伍的一切卑鄙阴谋。号召所有进步的亚非作家更加提高警惕，加强我们队伍的团结，更加斗志昂扬地继续进行我们的战斗，为一九六七年在中国召开的第三届亚非作家大会作好进一步的准备，高举亚非作家团结的、反对以美国为首的帝国主义的战斗旗帜，从胜利走向更大的胜利。我们运动所赋有的战斗反帝路线必胜！修正主义投降主义路线必败！
