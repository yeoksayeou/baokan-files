Vietnamese People's Armed Forces Launch Another Heavy Attack on An Khe U.S. Military Airfield

The Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces on the night of September 3 launched a heavy attack on the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division helicopter base at An Khe airfield in Gia Lai Province, destroying more than 40 helicopters, damaging many more, and killing many U.S. aggressor troops.

Prior to this, the U.S. military airfield had been attacked by the Liberation Armed Forces on February 20 and June 5 this year. In the three surprise attacks, the Liberation Armed Forces destroyed and damaged a total of 149 enemy helicopters and killed 567 U.S. aggressor troops.

To prevent An Khe airfield from being attacked, the U.S. aggressor troops had strengthened the defense of the airfield. However, the brave Liberation Armed Forces once again launched a heavy attack on this heavily guarded U.S. military airfield on the night of September 3. They bravely and intelligently breached all enemy lines and simultaneously launched heavy artillery fire on the U.S. aggressor troops' gathering place to commemorate the first anniversary of the 1st Cavalry Division's invasion of Vietnam and on the area where about 100 helicopters were parked, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

Xinhua News Agency, September 24: According to reports from Saigon, the Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces on September 22 launched a heavy attack on two U.S. Navy minesweepers operating on a river south of Saigon. One of the minesweepers was severely damaged.

According to Western news agencies, the Liberation Armed Forces' recoilless cannons damaged the bridge of a minesweeper, causing severe casualties among the crew. The United Press International reported: "This is the third attack by the Liberation Armed Forces on minesweepers in this area in less than a month."

It was also reported that the Liberation Armed Forces shelled an enemy airstrip northwest of Qui Nhon at dawn on September 23, causing enemy casualties and losses. On the same day, a command post of the puppet army in South Vietnam, located about 340 kilometers northeast of Saigon, was also attacked by the Liberation Armed Forces.

Xinhua News Agency, September 24: According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the military and civilian population of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen provinces in South Vietnam have annihilated nearly 6,000 South Korean mercenary troops in the first nine months of this year.

The South Korean mercenary troops, driven by U.S. imperialism and the Park Chung-hee clique to South Vietnam, have been mainly active in Binh Dinh and Phu Yen provinces. They have been committing atrocities everywhere, including rape, looting, arson, and robbery, and have accumulated a heavy blood debt.

The military and civilian population of Binh Dinh and Phu Yen provinces have decided to avenge the blood debt and resolutely punish these mercenary troops. The Liberation Armed Forces in Phu Yen Province annihilated 1,228 South Korean mercenary troops in the anti-"sweeping" battles from January 19 to February 18. In the northern part of Binh Dinh Province, from January 27 to March 7, the South Korean mercenary troops, who were at the forefront of the U.S. master's "dry season counteroffensive," were annihilated, totaling 1,225. In the four anti-"sweeping" battles from February to May, the military and civilian population of Binh Dinh Province also annihilated nearly 2,000 South Korean mercenary troops.

Xinhua News Agency, September 21: According to the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the guerrilla forces in various provinces of South Vietnam have continued to launch attacks, annihilating a large number of enemy troops.

The guerrilla forces in the rubber plantations of Hanh Long and An Long in Spring Long County, Binh Thuan Province, from August 24 to 29, consecutively intercepted and attacked the enemy who came to plunder and destroy the people's property, killing and wounding 78 enemy troops, including 66 U.S. aggressor troops. On August 29 and September 3, the guerrilla forces in this county also blew up two enemy military vehicles on the second highway, killing and wounding 12 enemy troops, including 6 U.S. aggressor troops.

    为了防止安溪机场遭到袭击，美国侵略军曾加强了对这个机场的防守。但是英勇的解放武装力量仍然在九月三日晚间再一次对这个戒备森严的美军机场发起了猛烈袭击。他们勇敢和机智地越过敌人的所有防线，同时向美国侵略军举行纪念第一骑兵师侵越一周年集会的地方和大约有一百多架直升飞机停放的地方进行猛烈炮轰，打得敌人狼狈不堪。
