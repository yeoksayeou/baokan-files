The general secretary of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation and chairman of the Ceylon Plantation Workers Union, Samugathasan, recently spoke at a meeting of the Ceylon Plantation Workers Union. He denounced modern revisionists for advocating class cooperation, promoting "peaceful transition" and "peaceful coexistence," and attempting to disperse and paralyze the revolutionary will of the working class.

He said: The experience of the world revolutionary movement has made us firmly believe that without relentless struggle, it is impossible to defeat imperialism and the reactionaries. The reactionaries will never allow the working class and its allies to peacefully take over power. He pointed out that "peaceful transition" is a fantasy of modern revisionists.

He said that American imperialism is today the leader of the world's reactionaries and the number one enemy of the world's people. There is no question of "peaceful coexistence" with it.

He said: "We must establish a united front against American imperialism worldwide. Only then can we eliminate and bury imperialism led by American imperialism and build a new civilization on its grave."

In his speech, he emphasized that in the process of opposing imperialism, it is necessary to eliminate the influence of modern revisionism.

Samugathasan, in his speech, paid tribute to the heroic Vietnamese people who are waging a people's war to defend their homeland and to the people of Congo, Angola, Southern Rhodesia, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela who are fighting. He pointed out that the right-wing military coup in Indonesia is not a sign of the strength of the reactionaries. He expressed brotherly respect and active support to the Indonesian comrades, especially the revolutionary plantation workers of Indonesia, and firmly believed that the Indonesian revolution would succeed.

In discussing the situation in India, he pointed out that India is now suffering from widespread famine. The thoroughly pro-imperialist reactionary government has mortgaged India to dollar imperialism and is pursuing a foreign policy against China and Pakistan.

The meeting of the Ceylon Plantation Workers Union was held on September 12 and 13. Several hundred representatives and observers attended the meeting. A congratulatory message from the Chinese Agricultural and Forestry Workers Union was read at the meeting.

    锡兰工联总书记谴责现修鼓吹阶级合作时指出
    帝国主义和反动派是不打不倒的
    印度反动政府已经把印度抵押给美帝国主义
    新华社科伦坡十八日电　锡兰工会联合会总书记兼锡兰种植园工人工会主席桑穆加塔桑最近在锡兰种植园工人工会会议上发表讲话，谴责现代修正主义者鼓吹阶级合作，宣扬什么“和平过渡”、“和平共处”，企图涣散和麻痹工人阶级的革命意志。
    他说：世界革命运动的经验，使我们坚信，不进行无情的斗争，是不能打败帝国主义和反动派的，反动派决不会让工人阶级和它的同盟者和平接管政权。他指出，“和平过渡”是现代修正主义者的幻想。
    他说，美帝国主义是今天世界反动派的首领，是世界人民的头号敌人，根本谈不上什么同它“和平共处”。
    他说：“一定要建立全世界反对美帝国主义的统一阵线，这样我们才能消灭和埋葬以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，并在它的墓地上建立起新的文明。”
    他在讲话中强调指出，在反对帝国主义的进程中，必须消除现代修正主义的影响。
    桑穆加塔桑在讲话中向正在为保卫祖国而进行人民战争的英雄的越南人民和在战斗中的刚果、安哥拉、南罗得西亚、多米尼加共和国和委内瑞拉等国家的人民致敬。
    桑穆加塔桑指出，印度尼西亚右派军人集团实行法西斯军事政变并不是反动派强大的表现。他向印度尼西亚同志，特别是印度尼西亚革命的种植园工人表示兄弟般的敬意和积极声援，并且表示坚决相信印度尼西亚的革命必将成功。
    在谈到印度的局势时，他指出，印度现在遍地饥荒。彻头彻尾地亲帝国主义的反动政府已经把印度抵押给美元帝国主义，并且执行着反对中国和巴基斯坦的对外政策。
    锡兰种植园工人工会的这次会议是在九月十二日和十三日举行的。几百位代表和观察员出席了会议。会上曾宣读了中国农林工会的贺电。
