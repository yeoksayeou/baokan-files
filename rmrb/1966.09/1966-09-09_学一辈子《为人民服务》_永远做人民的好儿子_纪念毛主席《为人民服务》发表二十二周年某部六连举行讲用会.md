A certain regiment's Sixth Company holds a study session to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of Chairman Mao's "In the Service of the People"

According to Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou on the 8th, the Sixth Company of a certain regiment in the Guangzhou Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a lively study session to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of Chairman Mao's "In the Service of the People."

The study session began with Deputy Company Commander Liu Xue Liang saying: We revolutionary soldiers are completely and thoroughly in the service of the people. I deeply feel that:

	To serve the people, one must not have any selfish thoughts

	In recent years, I have repeatedly used Chairman Mao's great thoughts in "In the Service of the People" to arm my mind, constantly fighting against my selfish thoughts, strengthening my fighting will, and firming up my revolutionary spirit. In the past, I considered my family more, which affected my work. As a Communist Party member, can I let personal issues affect the Party's work? With this question in mind, I studied "In the Service of the People." Chairman Mao taught us: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. This army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests." The four characters "completely" and "thoroughly" in this sentence made me think deeply. I repeatedly thought, "completely" and "thoroughly" are the opposites of selfish thoughts. How can one achieve "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people with selfish thoughts? The more I thought, the more I felt something was wrong. By comparing myself with Comrade Zhang Side's revolutionary spirit, I exposed all my selfish thoughts and used the four characters "completely" and "thoroughly" to fight against my selfish thoughts. After a fierce struggle, I finally made the correct thoughts victorious.

Class leader and Five Good Soldier Liang Qing said: Comrade Zhang Side and countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the revolutionary cause and the people's interests, bringing us today's happy life. I will advance along the footsteps of the martyrs in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	To serve the people, one must not fear hardship or death

	I am a young intellectual who joined the army in 1961. After coming to the unit, I either worked on national defense construction or agricultural production. In 1965, the unit reclaimed land and planted rice on the southern beach. Because there were few oxen, we had to pull the plows and harrows ourselves, making the work very arduous. Every day after work, I felt my waist and legs aching. Thus, my thoughts gradually changed, fearing that my body would be ruined. At this time, the political instructor encouraged me to study "In the Service of the People." Chairman Mao said: "To strive is to have sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, think of the suffering of the majority of the people. We die for the people, and it is a worthy death." By comparing myself with Chairman Mao's teachings, I repeatedly examined my thoughts and understood that a person should wholeheartedly serve the people, establishing a proletarian worldview of living for the revolution and dying for the revolution. I realized that any revolutionary, in peacetime, should have a revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship or fatigue, and in wartime, should be able to fearlessly sacrifice their lives when the struggle requires it. Thus, I made up my mind to learn from martyrs like Zhang Side and Dong Cunrui, taking their spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death as an example, tempering my revolutionary will in arduous labor. I vowed to pull the plow for the revolution for a lifetime. In the future, I will strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially to repeatedly study "In the Service of the People," transform my subjective world, and forever be a good son of the people and a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Li Qifu, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a new soldier, said: We came from all over the country to defend our motherland and work for world revolution. To achieve common progress, we must:

	Revolutionaries must care for and help each other

	In April this year, I heard that a comrade I knew in the new recruits' company was not settling down in the artillery regiment, affecting work. I wanted to help him. Chairman Mao taught us: "We all came from different parts of the country, for a common revolutionary goal, and came together.... All members of the revolutionary army must care for, love, and help each other." I told the leadership about my thoughts, and the leadership agreed with me. So, I took "Quotations from Chairman Mao," bought the diaries of Lei Feng and Wang Jie, and a notebook, walked more than twenty miles to the company where my comrade was stationed.

	At first, I didn't know where to start helping, but when I thought of Chairman Mao's words, which have the highest level and greatest power, one sentence is worth ten thousand, and every sentence is the truth, my mind opened up. I started by helping him study Chairman Mao's works, first raising his ideological awareness. The fundamental reason he was not settling down in the army was that he had not established a worldview of serving the people. I studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with him, telling stories of Zhang Side's loyal service to the revolution, ultimately sacrificing his life, and so on. During our heart-to-heart talks, I learned that his family suffered greatly in the old society, and we studied "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" together, using the method of reminiscing and comparing to conduct class education, raising his ideological awareness. In addition to caring for him politically, I also paid attention to caring for him in life. Through such mutual help, he finally understood for whom to be a soldier, for whom to fight, how to treat revolutionary work, and how to serve the people. He made rapid progress and was evaluated as a Five Good Soldier in the first half of the year.

	Through comrades caring for and helping each other, not only did we help a class brother grow and progress, but it also greatly promoted my own ideological revolutionization.

Five Good Soldier and livestock keeper Tang Liang said, all the work we do is revolutionary work, serving the people. I raise pigs, which is also a revolutionary task given to me by the Party. I think:

	To serve the people, no matter what work you do, it is glorious

	I am a soldier of peasant origin. When I joined the army, I brought with me the selfish and narrow-minded class imprint of a peasant small producer, and when I came to the unit to do production work, my heart sank, thinking that being a production soldier was not glorious and had no future. Under the help of the company commander and old comrades, I initially understood the great significance of the army doing production, understood the truth of farming for the revolution and serving the people, and improved my enthusiasm for production labor. Just when I was working hard, the company assigned me to raise pigs. Because I had not yet firmly established a proletarian worldview, my thoughts fluctuated again. I brought this question to study "In the Service of the People" again and studied the following quotations from Chairman Mao: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" Chairman Mao's words seemed to be directed at my thoughts. I thought, Zhang Side, Lei Feng, and other comrades were able to serve the people completely and thoroughly, even contributing their precious lives, because in their minds there was no "I," but the liberation cause of the people. Why can't I give up selfish thoughts and raise pigs well for the revolution? Later, the deputy political instructor also had a heart-to-heart talk with me. He combined "In the Service of the People" with the model deed of Time Changxing, a latrine cleaner, who worked for the revolution. This gave me great enlightenment and education, making me fundamentally understand that all our work is for the people, all are glorious, and all have a future. Therefore, I happily accepted the task of raising pigs and vowed to raise pigs for the revolution for a lifetime.

    学一辈子《为人民服务》  永远做人民的好儿子
    纪念毛主席《为人民服务》发表二十二周年某部六连举行讲用会
    据新华社广州八日电　中国人民解放军广州部队某团六连为纪念毛主席《为人民服务》发表二十二周年，召开了一次生动活泼的讲用会。
    讲用会一开始，副连长刘学良就说：我们革命战士是完全彻底为人民服务的，我深深体会到：
    为人民服务，不能有半点私心杂念
    几年来，我反复用毛主席《为人民服务》的伟大思想武装自己的头脑，不断地和自己的私心杂念作斗争，增强了战斗意志，坚定了革命事业心。过去有个时期，我对家庭考虑比较多，工作受到些影响。自己是个共产党员，能因为个人问题而影响党的工作吗？我带着这个问题学习《为人民服务》，毛主席教导说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”这段话中的“完全”、“彻底”四个字，引起了我的深思，我反复地想，“完全”“彻底”的对立面不正是个人主义的私心杂念吗？有了私心杂念怎能做到“完全”“彻底”为人民服务呢？越想越感到不对头。对照张思德同志的革命精神，我把个人主义思想全部亮了出来，又用“完全”“彻底”四个字来和私心杂念斗。经过激烈的思想斗争，终于使正确的思想取得了胜利。
    班长、五好战士梁清说：张思德同志和无数革命先烈，为了革命事业和人民的利益，牺牲了自己的生命，换来了今天的幸福生活，我要在毛泽东思想大学校里，沿着先烈们的脚印前进。
    为人民服务，就要不怕苦、不怕死
    我是一九六一年入伍的知识青年，到部队后，不是搞国防施工，就是搞农业生产。一九六五年部队在南海滩上开荒种稻，因为耕牛很少，需要用人来拉犁拉耙，工作十分艰苦，每天劳动回来，总感到腰酸腿痛。于是，我的思想逐渐起了变化，害怕把身体搞垮了。正在这时候，指导员启发我学习了《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”我对照毛主席的教导，反复检查自己的思想，懂得了一个人活着应该全心全意为人民服务，树立生为革命生，死为革命死的无产阶级世界观。我明确了任何一个革命者，在平时有了不怕苦不怕累的革命精神，在战时就能作到不怕死，当斗争需要时就能勇敢地献出自己的生命。于是，我下定决心，向张思德、董存瑞等先烈们学习，以他们那种一不怕苦、二不怕死的革命精神为榜样，在艰苦劳动中锻炼自己的革命意志。我立志为革命拉一辈子犁。今后，我决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，特别要反复地学习《为人民服务》，改造主观世界，永远做人民的好儿子，做毛主席的好战士。
    学习毛主席著作的积极分子、新战士李启福说：我们为了保卫祖国，搞世界革命，从五湖四海来到一起。我们要作到共同进步，就必须：
    革命者要互相关心，互相帮助
    今年四月间，我听说过去在新兵连认识的一位战友，分到炮团后不安心服役，影响工作，我想去帮助他。毛主席教导我们说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”我把自己的想法告诉领导，领导上很赞成我这样做。于是，我带着《毛主席语录》，又买了雷锋日记、王杰日记和笔记本，走了二十多里路来到战友所在的连队。
    起初，我不知道从何处帮起，但一想到毛主席的话水平最高、威力最大，一句顶一万句，句句是真理，我的脑子就开窍了。我就从帮助他学习毛主席著作做起，首先提高他的思想觉悟。他不安心部队工作的根本原因是为人民服务的世界观没有树立，我就和他一起学习“老三篇”，讲张思德同志忠心耿耿为革命，最后献出了自己的生命等故事。在谈心中，我了解到他家在旧社会苦大仇深，又一起学习了《中国社会各阶级的分析》，用回忆对比的方法，进行阶级教育，提高了他的思想觉悟。除了在政治上关怀他外，还注意从生活上关怀他。通过这样的互相帮助，使他终于懂得了为谁当兵，为谁打仗，怎样对待革命工作，怎样为人民服务的道理。他进步很快，上半年被评为五好战士。
    通过战友之间互相关心，互相帮助，不仅帮助了阶级兄弟成长进步，而且也大大促进了自己的思想革命化。
    五好战士、饲养员唐亮说，我们所做的一切工作都是革命工作，都是为人民服务的，我养猪也是党交给我的革命工作。我认为：
  为人民服务，不论干啥工作都光荣
    我是个农民出身的战士，带着农民小生产者自私狭隘的阶级烙印入伍，到部队搞生产，心里凉了半截，认为当生产兵不光荣，没有前途。在连首长和老同志的帮助下，我初步认清了军队搞生产的重大意义，懂得了为革命种田、为人民服务的道理，提高了生产劳动的积极性。正当我干得起劲的时候，连里调我去养猪，由于自己还没有真正确立无产阶级世界观，思想又有些波动。我带着这个问题重新学习了《为人民服务》，并学习了毛主席如下的语录：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”毛主席这些话，好像是针对我的思想讲的。心想，张思德、雷锋等同志之所以能够做到完全、彻底地为人民服务，以至贡献出自己的宝贵生命，这是因为在他们的脑子里没有“我”字，想的是人民的解放事业。我为什么不能抛弃私心杂念，为革命养好猪呢？后来副指导员又和我谈心。他结合《为人民服务》这篇文章，给我讲了掏粪工人时传祥同志为革命掏粪的模范事迹，这给了我很大的启发和教育，使我从根本上懂得了我们的一切工作都是为人民服务的，都光荣，都有前途。因此我愉快地接受了养猪的任务，决心为革命养一辈子猪。
