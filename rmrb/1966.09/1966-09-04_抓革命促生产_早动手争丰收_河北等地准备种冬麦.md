Broad masses of cadres and community members in the rural areas of Hebei Province are actively strengthening autumn crop management, striving for a bountiful autumn harvest, and preparing to plant winter wheat under the encouragement of the current great situation of the Cultural Revolution. Many places are focusing on accumulating fertilizer, deep plowing the land, and exchanging high-quality seeds.

Various communes and production teams have increased the amount of irrigated land through their winter and spring anti-drought struggles. Coupled with the fact that most regions received abundant rain during the summer, this provides favorable conditions for planting more and better winter wheat. Various places are determined to make full use of these favorable conditions to raise the standards of wheat sowing.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, September 2nd: Winter wheat sowing is about to begin in the mountainous areas of Shanxi Province. The Jinan and Jinzhong regions have launched comprehensive preparations for wheat sowing to ensure timely sowing and strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

At present, various places are actively leveling the land, accumulating fertilizer, and exchanging wheat seeds. In the Jinan area, 52.3 million mu of fallow wheat fields have all undergone summer plowing, of which 36 million mu have been deeply plowed. The farmers in the Jinzhong area are working with the spirit of "early is good," grasping the revolution to promote production, and striving for quick results in their autumn sowing preparations. Jincheng started sending more than 80 million piculs of fertilizer to the fields in mid-August. By the time the autumn crops are harvested, they will strive to ensure that all 30 million mu of relay-cropped wheat fields in the county are sown on time.

Members of the Goulou Production Brigade in the Shuanglou Commune of Hai'an County, Jiangsu, are strengthening the management of rice fields.

    河北等地准备种冬麦
    据新华社保定二日电　河北省农村广大干部社员在当前文化大革命大好形势鼓舞下，积极加强秋田管理，夺取秋季丰收，并为种好冬小麦做准备工作。许多地方正在抓紧积肥，深翻土地，调换良种。
    各地社队通过去冬今春的抗旱斗争，水浇地增加了很多，加上今年大部地区伏雨较多，为多种种好冬小麦提供了有利条件。各地决心充分运用这些有利条件，使小麦播种工作达到更高的标准。
    据新华社太原二日电　山西省山区即将开始播种冬小麦。晋南和晋东南两地区全面展开种麦准备工作，保证适时种好小麦，力争明年小麦丰收。
    目前，各地正在积极整地、积肥和调换麦种。晋南区五百二十三万亩休闲麦田全部经过了伏耕，其中深耕的有三百六十万亩。晋东南区的农民群众，以早字当头、抓革命促生产、好中求快的精神，为秋种作准备。晋城在八月中旬就把八百多万担肥料送到了地头岸边，到大秋作物成熟时，就可以力争做到全县三十万亩回茬麦田全部适时种上。
