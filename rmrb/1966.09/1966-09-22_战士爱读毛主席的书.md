Chairman Mao's works have arrived at the platoon,
The military camp is blooming with red flowers;
Holding the golden book, we think of Chairman Mao,
Our songs fly to Zhongnanhai;
Soldiers love reading Chairman Mao's books,
Our minds are clear, our hearts are open,
We recognize class enemies clearly,
We trample underfoot the ghosts and snakes;
We strive to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao,
We are thorough revolutionaries!

    战士爱读毛主席的书
    海军某部
    毛主席著作到连来，
    军营红花朵朵开；
    手捧金书想念毛主席，
    歌声飞到中南海；
    战士爱读毛主席的书，
    心明眼亮胸怀开，
    阶级敌人认得清，
    牛鬼蛇神脚下踩；
    做毛主席的好战士，
    当彻底的革命派！
