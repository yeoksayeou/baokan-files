		Forever Loyal to Chairman Mao, Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, Loyal to the Party, Loyal to the People
		The Cultural Revolution Will Surely Triumph Under the Command of Chairman Mao
		The Red Guards Resolve to Follow Chairman Mao's Instructions, Firmly Grasp the Direction of the Struggle, and Learn from Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
		The Broad Masses of Soldiers and Officers of the PLA Express: Our Banner of Unity and Our Banner of Struggle is the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought

		According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 17th, Chairman Mao received revolutionary youngsters in the capital once again, adding new fighting strength to the Red Guards and revolutionary students across the country who have achieved brilliant results in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They unanimously declared: We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers who are the main force in revolution and construction, and in the great waves of revolutionary struggle, temper ourselves into steadfast proletarian revolutionaries and into a new generation of communists.

		The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary students said: Workers, peasants, and soldiers have been, are, and will be the main force in revolution and construction. They love Chairman Mao the most, read Chairman Mao's books the most, and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Their revolutionary stance is the most steadfast, their revolutionary spirit is the most thorough, and they have the highest degree of organizational discipline. We must learn the fine qualities of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must be like workers, peasants, and soldiers, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. In the struggle, we must carry out the Sixteen Points without any deviation and fight shoulder to shoulder with workers, peasants, and soldiers to overthrow and expose those in power who are taking the capitalist road and all ghosts and monsters.

		Red Guards and revolutionary students in Shanghai, tempered in the history of class struggle, said: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, workers, peasants, and soldiers have always been the main force in revolutionary and construction undertakings. The proletarian heaven was won by the blood and sacrifice of workers, peasants, and soldiers; the poor and backward face of our country is being rapidly changed by the hard work and infinite wisdom of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They said: We must learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers to hate the enemy deeply, love the Party and the people deeply, dare to struggle, and be good at struggling. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will fight side by side with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to thoroughly overthrow those in power who are taking the capitalist road and make all ghosts and monsters never able to rise again! Many revolutionary students in Chengdu recently invited old Red Army soldiers, old workers, and old poor peasants to tell stories of revolutionary struggles and their bitter family histories before liberation. After listening to the reports, the Red Guards and revolutionary students expressed that our parents suffered greatly under the old society and went through a long and tortuous struggle. In the current complex and sharp class struggle, we must take revolutionary predecessors as examples, stand firm against black winds and evil waves, and overcome difficulties and dangers. We must resolutely follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

		The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary students expressed that they would learn the most steadfast class stance of workers, peasants, and soldiers, hate the enemy like workers, peasants, and soldiers, and love the people like workers, peasants, and soldiers, forever being good sons and daughters of the working people. Some revolutionary students from Wuhan Medical College, who had just returned from the socialist education movement in the countryside, excitedly said: Poor and lower-middle peasants, like workers and PLA soldiers, have the most steadfast revolutionary stance and are the most enthusiastic towards the people. We revolutionary youth must be willing to be small students of workers, peasants, and soldiers and temper ourselves into revolutionary fighters loyal to Chairman Mao and the people. The Red Guards of Harbin Institute of Technology said, when we were born in the days of war, who fed us with every grain of rice and every drop of water? It was the people. Our growth process is the process of the Party and the people raising us. We will never forget the people. Workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only our nurturers but also our best teachers. We must learn from them in the great waves of revolutionary struggle. We must learn their most steadfast class stance and their clear class feelings of hating the enemy and loving the people. Many Red Guards and revolutionary students, in order to better learn from poor and lower-middle peasants, recently organized to go to the countryside to participate in the autumn harvest. The Red Guards and revolutionary students of Hongqi Middle School in Hohhot have been going to the fields with sickles to harvest with the poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs during the day, studying Chairman Mao's works and discussing the Sixteen Points together in the fields; at night, they visit old poor peasants with deep hatred and bitterness, asking them to talk about revolutionary struggle history. The deep feelings of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants for the great leader Chairman Mao, their love for the collective, their diligence and simplicity, their ruthlessness towards the enemy and leniency towards themselves, and their firm support and high evaluation of the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, all greatly encouraged the revolutionary youngsters. The Red Guards said: Through the practice of labor and struggle, we further understand: the real revolutionary force is the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Without this powerful revolutionary backing of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we will definitely not be able to complete the historical mission of one fight, two criticize, and three reform. In Shenyang, more than ten thousand Red Guards recently held a grand rally to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. The rally issued an appeal to all Red Guards in the city: Go to the countryside in batches to participate in the autumn harvest, learn from poor and lower-middle peasants in labor, and be good students and descendants of poor and lower-middle peasants.

		According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 17th, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA, inspired by the joyous news of Chairman Mao receiving a million revolutionary youngsters again, unanimously expressed their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary students under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, hit accurately and hit hard, and win new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

		The broad masses of soldiers and officers in various units, with deep emotion, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and the speeches of Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai. They unanimously agreed that the direction of the struggle in the Cultural Revolution has always been correct. The goals of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary students are the same, and the direction is consistent. We must unite more closely under the wise leadership and command of the great commander Chairman Mao and march forward together. A Five Good Soldier, Liu Rizeng, from a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." Whether on the battlefield of armed struggle or on the battlefield of the Cultural Revolution, distinguishing between enemies and ourselves is the top priority for every revolutionary. Only in this way can we unite the broad masses, strengthen the revolutionary forces, grasp the direction of the struggle, and concentrate our forces to severely strike a small handful of right-wing elements within the Party, especially those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and overthrow, smash, and expose them. The soldiers and officers of a certain military academy said, in the Cultural Revolution, we vow to stand with the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards across the country, under the personal command of the great commander and supreme commander Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and unite and fight. Our banner of unity and our banner of struggle is the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

		The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Navy, Air Force, and the Nanjing, Shenyang, Fuzhou, Jinan, Lanzhou, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia military regions unanimously expressed that they would regard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the best and most lively classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learn and apply in the struggle, take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, take the Sixteen Points as the weapon, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and win new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

    广大红卫兵和革命学生们说：工农兵过去、现在和将来都是革命和建设的主力军。工农兵最热爱毛主席，最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话，他们的革命立场最坚定，革命精神最彻底，具有高度的组织性纪律性。我们一定要学习工农兵的优良品质，要像工农兵那样，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民，在斗争中不折不扣地贯彻执行十六条，和工农兵并肩战斗，把走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神斗倒斗垮斗臭。
    在阶级斗争历史的熏陶下成长起来的上海红卫兵小将和革命学生们说：在毛主席和党中央的领导下，工农兵从来就是革命和建设事业的主力军。无产阶级的天下，是工农兵流血牺牲打下来的；我们国家一穷二白的面貌是工农兵用勤劳的双手和无穷的智慧迅速改变着的。他们说：我们一定要学习工农兵对敌人无比愤恨，对党对人民无比热爱，敢于斗争，善于斗争的革命精神。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，同广大工农兵并肩战斗，彻底斗垮走资本主义道路的当权派，把一切牛鬼蛇神打得永世不得翻身！成都市许多学校的革命学生，最近邀请老红军、老工人和老贫农讲述革命斗争史，讲他们解放前的血泪家史。红卫兵和革命学生听了报告以后表示，我们父辈受尽了旧社会的苦难，经历了长期曲折的斗争。在当前复杂尖锐的阶级斗争中，我们一定要以革命前辈为榜样，做到黑风恶浪顶得住，艰难险阻吓不倒，坚决按照毛主席指引的方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    广大红卫兵和革命学生表示，要学习工农兵最坚定的阶级立场，像工农兵那样仇恨敌人，像工农兵那样热爱人民，永远做劳动人民的好儿子。武汉医学院刚从农村参加社会主义教育运动回来的一些革命学生激动地说：贫下中农同工人、解放军战士一样，他们的革命立场最坚定，对人民最热忱。我们革命青年要甘当工农兵的小学生，把自己锻炼成为忠于毛主席、忠于人民的革命战士。哈尔滨工程学院的红卫兵们说，我们在战火纷飞的年代里出生的时候，是谁一口米一口水把我们喂大的？是人民。我们成长的过程，就是党和人民抚养我们的过程，我们永远忘不了人民。工农兵不仅是我们的抚育者，也是我们最好的先生。我们要在革命斗争的大风大浪中向他们学习，我们要学习他们最坚定的阶级立场，学习他们恨敌人爱人民的鲜明的阶级感情。许多地方的红卫兵和革命学生为了更好地向贫下中农学习，最近纷纷有组织地下乡参加了秋收劳动。呼和浩特市红旗中学的红卫兵和革命学生，连日来白天拿上镰刀同郊区贫下中农下田秋收，在地头共同学习毛主席著作，讨论十六条；晚上去访问苦大仇深的老贫农，请他们谈革命斗争史。广大贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席所表现的深厚感情，他们热爱集体，勤劳朴实，对敌狠、对己和的优良品质以及坚决支持和高度评价红卫兵的革命精神，都使革命小将们受到很大鼓舞。红卫兵小将们说：通过劳动和斗争的实践，我们进一步懂得：真正的革命力量是广大的工农兵群众。没有工农兵这个强大的革命后盾，我们决不能完成一斗、二批、三改这个历史使命。在沈阳，一万多名红卫兵日前还举行了隆重的向工农兵学习动员大会。大会向全市红卫兵发出倡议：分批下乡参加秋收，在劳动中向贫下中农学习，作贫下中农的好学生，好后代。
    据新华社十七日讯　人民解放军各部队的广大指战员，为毛主席又一次接见百万革命小将的喜讯所鼓舞，纷纷表示坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，跟广大工农群众和革命学生一起，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下团结起来，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，打得准，打得狠，夺取文化大革命的新胜利。
    各部队广大指战员怀着无比激动的心情，反复学习了毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》《湖南农民运动考察报告》等光辉著作，学习了林彪同志、周恩来同志的讲话，一致认为，文化大革命斗争的大方向始终是正确的。广大工农兵和革命学生的目标是共同的，方向是一致的。我们一定在伟大统帅毛主席的英明领导和指挥下，更加紧密地团结起来，携手前进。北京部队某部五好战士刘日增说，毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”不管是在炮火连天的武斗战场上，还是在文化大革命的文斗战场上，分清敌我都是每个革命者的头等大事，只有这样，才能团结广大群众，壮大革命力量，掌握住斗争的大方向，集中力量狠狠打击一小撮资产阶级右派分子，特别是着重打击那些钻进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。某军事学校的指战员们说，在文化大革命中，我们誓与全国广大革命师生和红卫兵小将站在一起，在伟大统帅、最高司令毛主席亲自指挥下，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，团结战斗。我们团结的旗帜，战斗的旗帜，就是毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    海军、空军和南京、沈阳、福州、济南、兰州、新疆、西藏、内蒙古等部队的广大指战员，纷纷表示，要把无产阶级文化大革命当作活学活用毛主席著作的最好、最活的大课堂，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，以毛泽东思想为指南，以十六条为武器，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，夺取文化大革命的新胜利。（附图片）
