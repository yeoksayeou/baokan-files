Foreign table tennis friends love Chairman Mao and express their desire to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought

Friends from the international table tennis community, who have come to Beijing for the International Table Tennis Invitational to promote unity in the anti-imperialist cause and to foster friendship, have expressed their profound respect and sincere admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and their unwavering faith in the great Mao Zedong Thought, both on and off the court and during their visits and tours.

We love Chairman Mao!

"To be able to come to China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, is such a great fortune!" Many foreign friends who participated in the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational expressed their sincere love for our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, as soon as they arrived in Beijing. They eagerly requested badges with Chairman Mao's image, portraits of Chairman Mao, and copies of Chairman Mao's works to spread revolutionary truths. When their requests were fulfilled, they were overjoyed. They proudly wore the shiny badges with Chairman Mao's image on their chests. Palestinian friends hung the embroidered portrait of Chairman Mao in their rooms, saying, "By hanging Chairman Mao's portrait on the door, we can see Chairman Mao every day." Many friends, after receiving Chairman Mao's works, were overjoyed and excitedly read and studied them. Even late at night, some friends were still reading Chairman Mao's works under the light, seeking revolutionary truths.

Friends from Yemen, by the Red Sea, borrowed a copy of Chairman Mao's work "Current Situation and Our Tasks" in Arabic as soon as they arrived in Beijing. Team leader A. Shandani immediately gathered all team members and read it aloud to them. Now that they have obtained many of Chairman Mao's works, their enthusiasm for learning has soared. Shandani said, "Chairman Mao's works will strengthen our resolve to carry the revolution to the end." Friends from Syria and Palestine, after receiving Chairman Mao's works, read them enthusiastically and expressed their desire to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

The heartfelt love that foreign friends have for Chairman Mao is truly moving. They come from different countries and regions, with different nationalities and languages, but they all sing the same song and shout the same praises for Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, everywhere they go.

Chairman Mao is the greatest teacher

Foreign friends' profound respect and admiration for Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, are not accidental. Many had read Chairman Mao's works before coming to China. The name Mao Zedong is always closely linked with the just struggles of the peoples of various countries against imperialism and for national liberation. Chairman Mao understands and cares the most about the peoples of various countries who are oppressed by imperialism and old and new colonialism, and he firmly supports their revolutionary struggles for national liberation. Vietnamese team leader Nguyen Duc Thu in the table tennis experience exchange meeting said, "At the critical moment when the U.S. imperialists escalated the war of aggression against Vietnam, Chairman Mao issued a statement, giving the Vietnamese people great support." Palestinian team leader Sa. Shurafa said: "Chairman Mao holds high the torch that liberates the peoples of various countries from the shackles of imperialism and colonialism. When the Palestinian people fight against U.S. and British imperialism and their lackeys for the liberation of their homeland, the Chinese government supports us in both moral and material terms. We salute the Chinese people, led by the great fighter and revolutionary leader Chairman Mao Zedong, for their struggle to liberate the oppressed peoples!"

In the global storm of revolution against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people but also the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary peoples of the world. As one team leader said, "Mao Zedong Thought not only guides the Chinese revolution to victory but also guides the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world." Yemeni team leader A. Shandani told a reporter, "I studied Chairman Mao's article 'Carry the Revolution Through to the End' in my country and was inspired by it." He said, "In the course of the revolution, the reactionaries may sometimes appear pitiful, but they are still counter-revolutionaries at heart, and we must remember this."

Syrian team leader A. Ahmad, after coming to China, has read several of Chairman Mao's works. In a conversation, he introduced his feelings about studying "Mao Zedong on Imperialism and All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers." He said, "When the people fear imperialism, imperialism will act recklessly and commit atrocities everywhere. When the people rise up to fight, imperialism fears the people." He said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest teacher, and Chairman Mao's thoughts are the most correct."

Some foreign friends said that after coming to China, they have a deeper understanding of the great Mao Zedong Thought. To win the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle and the victory of the national liberation revolutionary struggle, one must master Mao Zedong Thought well.

Great achievements are attributed to the great Mao Zedong Thought

During the competition, foreign friends, through a series of visits and tours, saw with their own eyes the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao. They praised the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought and expressed their boundless admiration for the great achievements made in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Soon after arriving in Beijing, foreign friends enthusiastically watched the large-scale song and dance documentary "The East Is Red." This film, which depicts the long and arduous revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people, received enthusiastic applause from the audience. Friends from Ceylon, Lebanon, Syria, and other countries unanimously praised, "Excellent, excellent." Yemeni team leader A. Shandani gave a thumbs up and said with deep feelings, "The East Is Red is extremely, extremely, extremely good. It makes us understand how the Chinese people have come this far in their revolutionary journey." Many foreign friends were deeply moved when they visited the large-scale clay sculpture group "The Rent Collection Courtyard." They had strong reactions in front of the shocking scenes of class struggle in the old Chinese countryside. Many foreign friends left messages in the guest book, praising the great victories achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao after a long period of arduous struggles.

At the magnificent Chinese Revolution Museum and the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum, foreign friends further felt the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought. The entire Pakistani table tennis team spent three whole hours systematically learning about the history of the Chinese people's armed struggles. Each revolutionary relic and each chart all shone with the splendor of Mao Zedong Thought. Team leader Faruk Zaman, when talking about the victory of the Chinese revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, excitedly told the reporter, "This is the truth, indeed." Ceylon team leader A. Vitiya Lingam, after the visit, tightly grasped the hand of a Chinese comrade and excitedly said, "Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao!"

The guests were not only inspired by the history of the Chinese revolution's struggles but also enthusiastically cheered for the great achievements of the Three Red Banners. In the afternoon of the 4th, Nepal team member P. L. Joshi and other team members enthusiastically visited the Hongxing People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing in the rain. Under the grape trellis and in the farmers' homes, they praised the great achievements of the people's commune. P. L. Joshi excitedly said, "The people's commune is extremely, extremely good. The lives of the people, especially the farmers, are extremely happy." Another Nepalese friend, G. L. Joshi, excitedly praised in Chinese, "Mao Zedong Thought is good, the people's commune is good, long live Mao Zedong!" Syrian table tennis team coach H. Nadim, when talking about the revolutionary spirit and great achievements of the Chinese people he saw, excitedly pointed out, "All of this should be attributed to the great Mao Zedong Thought!"

Friends from the international table tennis community felt particularly close to the rapid development of China's sports cause under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the continuous victories of the Chinese table tennis team. A large portrait of Chairman Mao playing table tennis hanging at the entrance of the Workers' Stadium competition hall aroused the high respect of foreign athletes. They said that Chairman Mao's concern and emphasis on promoting sports, swimming in the Yangtze River at the age of over seventy, is a great happiness for the Chinese people. Vietnamese team leader Nguyen Duc Thu said, "The Chinese table tennis team actively learns Mao Zedong Thought and uses Mao Zedong Thought to guide training and competition, thus achieving excellent results." Yemeni athlete Ali Habuli told a reporter at the closing ceremony, "The Chinese table tennis team arms itself with Mao Zedong Thought, so it has achieved victory."

"Long live Mao Zedong, the initiator of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The new situation of the vigorous development of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has attracted the great attention of many foreign friends participating in the invitational tournament. Some foreign friends learned that this unprecedented cultural revolution was personally initiated and commanded by our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, and could not help but shout, "Long live Mao Zedong, the initiator of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

Vietnamese team leader Nguyen Duc Thu enthusiastically praised the Chinese people for their efforts to learn Mao Zedong Thought and apply it to all work. He firmly believes that under the splendor of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will achieve even greater victories.

Yemeni team leader A. Shandani particularly emphasized the importance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution for countries and peoples striving for national independence and national liberation. He pointed out, "After defeating imperialism and eliminating domestic reactionaries, a revolution must also be carried out in the cultural realm, so that the revolution can be carried through to the end."

Palestinian team leader Salam Shurafa, in a speech at a reception, praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and excitedly said, "Under the great principles of the great leader Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have already achieved brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He shouted, "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the struggle of the Chinese people! Long live Mao Zedong, the initiator of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

On the 5th, when friends from various countries visited the capital's People's Park (formerly the Summer Palace), Chinese Red Guards expressed their deep friendship to foreign friends. Squads of Red Guards, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically expressed their firm support for the anti-imperialist struggles of distant friends. Foreign friends saw in the Red Guards' love for Chairman Mao, their adherence to Chairman Mao's words, and their thorough revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and being good at struggling, the growth of a new generation of people nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought in our country. Some foreign friends repeatedly shouted, "Long live the Red Guards! Long live the Red Guards!" Foreign friends' praise for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a support and encouragement to the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and make contributions to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

    毛泽东思想的光辉照耀四方
    外国乒乓球界朋友热爱毛主席　表示要用毛泽东思想武装自己
    为着团结反帝的共同事业和增进友好而来的外国乒乓球界的朋友们，在参加北京国际乒乓球邀请赛期间，无论在赛场内外，或是在参观访问活动中，都怀着最崇敬的心情，用最真诚的语言，表达了他们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想的无比信仰。
    我们热爱毛主席！
    “能够来到毛主席领导下的中国人民的首都是多么幸福啊！”参加北京国际乒乓球邀请赛的许多外国朋友们到达北京的第一天起，就表示了对我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席的真挚热爱。他们纷纷提出要有毛主席像的纪念章，要毛主席像，要传播革命真理的毛主席的著作。当朋友们这些要求得到满足的时候，他们是多么高兴啊！他们骄傲地把有毛主席像的金光闪闪的纪念章挂在自己的胸前。巴勒斯坦的朋友们得到刺绣的毛主席像后，便端端正正地挂在自己寝室的门上。他们说：“我们把毛主席像挂在门上，就可以天天看到毛主席了。”许多朋友得到了毛主席著作以后，欣喜万分，他们兴奋地阅读着，认真地研究着。深夜了，有的朋友还在电灯下打开毛主席著作，探求革命真理。
    来自红海之滨的也门朋友，刚到北京时，借到一本阿拉伯文版毛主席著作《目前形势和我们的任务》，团长阿·申达尼立即把全队人员召集在一起，亲自朗读给大家听。现在他们得到了许多毛主席著作，学习的热情更高了。申达尼说，毛主席著作将增强我们将革命进行到底的决心。叙利亚、巴勒斯坦的朋友们得到毛主席著作以后，热情阅读，表示要用毛泽东思想武装自己。
    外国朋友们衷心热爱毛主席的许多动人场面，令人十分感动。他们来自不同国家和地区，民族不同，语言不同，但是，却以同一个声音，到处高歌、到处为中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席欢呼。
    毛主席是最伟大的导师
    外国朋友们对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的无比敬仰和爱戴，并不是偶然的。许多人在未到中国之前，就读过毛主席的著作。毛泽东的名字，总是同各国人民反对帝国主义、争取民族解放的正义斗争紧密地联系在一起的。毛主席最了解、最关心在帝国主义和新老殖民主义压迫下的各国人民，最坚决地支持他们为争取民族解放而进行的革命斗争。越南代表团团长阮得寿在乒乓球经验交流会上说，当美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的严重时刻，毛主席发表声明，给越南人民以极大的支持。巴勒斯坦代表团团长萨·舒拉法说：毛主席高举着把各国人民从帝国主义和殖民主义的枷锁下解放出来的光辉的火炬。当巴勒斯坦人民为了祖国解放而同美英帝国主义及其走狗进行艰苦斗争的时候，中国政府在道义上和物质上给予我们支持。我们向伟大的战士、伟大的革命者毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民，为解放被压迫人民而进行的斗争致意！
    在席卷全球的反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的革命风暴中，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是世界革命人民心中的红太阳。正如一位代表团团长说：“毛泽东思想不仅指导中国革命取得胜利，而且也指导着世界人民的革命斗争。”也门代表团团长阿·申达尼对记者说：“我在国内就学习了毛主席的《将革命进行到底》的文章，从中得到了启发。”他说：“在革命的进程中，有时反动派会装得很可怜，但他们内心还是反革命的，我们应当记住这一点。”
    叙利亚代表团团长阿·艾哈迈德来到中国后，已读了好几篇毛主席著作，他在一次谈话中介绍了自己学习《毛泽东同志论帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎》的感受。他说：“当人民怕帝国主义时，帝国主义就会动手动脚，到处行凶。当人民起来斗争时，帝国主义就害怕人民。”他说：“毛主席是最伟大的导师，毛主席的思想是最正确的。”
    有的外国朋友说，他们来到中国后，对伟大的毛泽东思想领会得更深了。为了争取反帝斗争的胜利，为了争取民族解放革命斗争的胜利，一定要很好地掌握毛泽东思想。
    伟大的成就归功于伟大的毛泽东思想
    在比赛期间，外国朋友们通过一系列的参观访问，亲眼看到了中国人民在毛主席领导下所取得的巨大成就。他们盛赞毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，对中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得的巨大成就表示无限敬佩。
    外国朋友们来到北京不久，就兴致盎然地观看了大型歌舞纪录片《东方红》。这部描写中国人民漫长艰苦革命斗争的影片，博得了全场热烈的掌声。锡兰、黎巴嫩、叙利亚等国朋友异口同声地连连赞道：“很好，很好。”也门代表团团长阿·申达尼伸出大拇指，深有感触地说：“《东方红》非常非常非常的好，它使我们了解了中国人民的革命道路是怎样走过来的。”许多外国朋友在参观大型泥塑群像《收租院》时，感受很深。他们在一幅幅旧中国农村惊心动魄的阶级斗争的图景前面，反应十分强烈。许多外国朋友参观以后在留言簿上纷纷留言，赞扬中国人民在毛主席的领导下，经过长期的艰苦斗争所取得的伟大胜利。
    在宏伟的中国革命博物馆和中国人民革命军事博物馆，外国朋友进一步感受到毛泽东思想无往而不胜的巨大威力。巴基斯坦乒乓球队全体人员整整花了三个小时，系统地了解了中国人民武装斗争的历史。一件件革命文物、一张张图表，都闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉。团长法鲁克·扎曼谈到中国革命在毛泽东思想指导下取得胜利的时候，激动地对记者说：“这是真理，的确是这样。”锡兰代表团团长阿·维蒂亚林甘在参观之后，紧紧握着中国同志的手，兴奋地说：“毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    客人们不仅从中国革命的斗争历史中受到鼓舞，而且也为三面红旗的巨大成就热情欢呼。尼泊尔队的普·拉·乔希四日下午和其他队员一起，兴致勃勃地冒雨参观了北京市郊红星人民公社。在葡萄架旁，在农民家中，他们都盛赞人民公社的巨大成就。普·拉·乔希激动地说：“人民公社非常非常好，人民的生活、特别是农民的生活非常幸福。”另一位尼泊尔朋友吉·拉·乔希激动地用中国话赞道：“毛泽东思想很好，人民公社很好，毛泽东万岁！”叙利亚乒乓球队教练哈·纳迪姆，在谈到他看到中国人民意气风发的革命风貌和所取得的伟大成就时，兴奋地指出：“所有这一切，都应该归功于伟大的毛泽东思想！”
    各国乒乓球界的朋友们，对毛泽东思想指导下新中国体育事业的迅速发展和我国乒乓球队的不断胜利，感到特别亲切。在工人体育馆比赛大厅入口处挂着的一幅巨大的毛主席打乒乓球的照片，引起了外国运动员们的崇高敬意。他们说，毛主席那样关怀、重视开展体育运动，七十多岁的高龄还在长江中游泳，真是中国人民的巨大幸福。越南代表团团长阮得寿说：“中国乒乓球队积极学习毛泽东思想，以毛泽东思想来指导训练和比赛，从而得到了优秀的成绩。”也门运动员阿里·赫布利在闭幕式上向记者说：“中国乒乓球队用毛泽东思想武装自己，所以取得了胜利。”
    “中国文化大革命的倡导者毛泽东万岁！”
    我国无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃发展的新形势，引起了参加邀请赛的许多外国朋友们的极大重视。有些外国朋友了解到这次史无前例的文化大革命是我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席亲自发动亲自指挥的时候，情不自禁地欢呼：“中国文化大革命的倡导者毛泽东万岁！”
    越南代表团团长阮得寿热情赞扬中国人民努力学习毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想运用到各项工作中去。他深信，中国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，文化大革命将会取得更大的胜利。
    也门代表团团长阿·申达尼特别强调文化大革命对那些争取民族独立、争取民族解放的国家和人民的重要意义。他指出：“在战胜帝国主义，消灭国内反动派后，文化上也要进行革命，这样才能把革命进行到底。”
    巴勒斯坦代表团团长萨拉姆·舒拉法在一次招待会上的讲话中赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命时，激动地说：中国人民在伟大的领袖毛泽东的伟大原则指导下，在文化大革命中已经取得了辉煌胜利。他高呼：“中国文化大革命万岁！中国人民的斗争万岁！中国文化大革命的倡导者毛泽东万岁！”
    各国朋友五日畅游首都人民公园（原颐和园）的时候，中国的红卫兵们向外国朋友们表达了深厚的情谊。一队队红卫兵，手持《毛主席语录》，热情地向远方的客人表示，坚决支持他们的反帝斗争事业。各国朋友从红卫兵们热爱毛主席、听毛主席的话和他们那种敢于斗争、善于斗争的彻底革命精神中，看到了毛泽东思想哺育下我国一代新人的成长。有的外国朋友不断高呼：“红卫兵好！红卫兵万岁！”外国朋友对我国无产阶级文化大革命的赞扬，是对中国人民的支持和鼓舞。我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，一定能够把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为中国革命和世界革命作出贡献。
