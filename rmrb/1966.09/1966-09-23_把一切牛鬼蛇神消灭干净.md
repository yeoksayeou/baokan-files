First of all, I would like to express my respect to the great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, under whose leadership the Chinese people are triumphantly carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. I regard the Chinese Cultural Revolution as my own cause and am delighted about it. As the revolutionary students in Beijing have said, the Cultural Revolution will further consolidate the world revolution's red base, and the Cultural Revolution will enable Chinese comrades to play an even greater role in the international communist movement and the world's national democratic revolution. The victory of the Cultural Revolution inspires us, the fighting people of Japan, and it is also a victory for the true revolutionaries of Japan. I hope that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end and eliminate all monsters and demons completely.

In order to learn from the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the number of people here who are studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" is increasing. We are now striving to learn what we most need. Chairman Mao Zedong is the leader of the world revolution.

We believe that in Japan, all monsters and demons, no matter how powerful they appear on the surface, are destined to be defeated by the broad masses of revolutionary Japanese people, and to be discarded by the Japanese people.

I hereby proclaim:

Long live the brilliant banner of the world revolution in contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the combat friendship between the peoples of Japan and China, who have united under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism to oppose U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries, all monsters and demons!

    把一切牛鬼蛇神消灭干净
    首先，我要向在全世界人民的伟大导师、敬爱的毛泽东主席领导下胜利地进行着伟大的文化大革命的中国人民表示敬意。我把中国的文化大革命当做自己的事情，并为此感到高兴。因为，正像北京的革命学生们所说的那样，文化大革命将更加巩固世界革命的红色根据地，文化大革命将使中国战友在国际共产主义运动和世界民族民主革命中发挥更加伟大的作用。文化大革命的胜利给我们战斗的日本人民以无限的鼓舞，同时它也是真正革命的日本人民的胜利。希望中国人民在毛主席的领导下，把文化大革命进行到底，把一切牛鬼蛇神消灭干净。
    为了向中国文化大革命学习，在我们这里努力学习《毛泽东选集》的人正在增加。我们现在要努力学习我们最需要的东西。毛泽东主席是世界革命的领袖。
    我们认为，在日本，所有的牛鬼蛇神，不管他们表面多么强大，最后也注定会被广大的革命的日本人民打得头破血流，被日本人民所抛弃。
    我要高呼：
    当代世界革命伟大的光辉旗帜——毛泽东思想万岁！
    文化大革命万岁！
    高举马列主义和无产阶级国际主义旗帜，为反对美帝国主义以及一切反动派、一切牛鬼蛇神而结成的日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
                〔日本〕芳崎
