	An American imperialist military aircraft invaded our airspace over Guangxi this morning, conducting reconnaissance and provocation.

	The People's Air Force immediately took off to intercept, and the enemy aircraft was hit and fled south in panic.

	The spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense strongly protested the repeated incursions by American imperialist military aircraft into our airspace. The spokesperson stated: American military aircraft have recently been repeatedly invading our airspace, conducting acts of war provocation, which has aroused the extreme indignation of our people. The Chinese people, with their high level of revolutionary vigilance, will absolutely not allow the American aggressors to invade us at will. We must sternly warn the American aggressors: the crimes you have committed against the Chinese people will definitely be punished. If you dare to invade, we will resolutely annihilate you.
