The broad masses of community members in the southern apple-producing regions of Liaoning Province have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters, and overcome drought and pestilence to achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest. This year's total actual production of summer apples in the entire region has increased by 93 percent compared to last year, and by 8.6 percent compared to the highest historical production year. The autumn apples currently being harvested in large quantities are also abundant and of good quality. According to investigations by relevant departments, the production of autumn apples in various places will also exceed the highest historical production year.
