Two U.S. aircraft brazenly invaded our Dongxing County, indiscriminately strafing our villages and commune members.

Our heroic air force struck back head-on, damaging one enemy aircraft.

The Ministry of National Defense has lodged the strongest protest against the U.S. imperialists' mad war provocations. We warn the U.S. aggressors: the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not afraid of any war threats. We are standing by, fully prepared. If you insist on a showdown, then come on! The iron fists of 700 million Chinese people will smash the aggressors to pieces.

New China News Agency, September 16th: Two U.S. imperialist F-105 fighter jets brazenly invaded our Guangxi Dongxing Multi-Ethnic Autonomous County airspace on the morning of the 9th, indiscriminately strafing our villages and commune members who were working. Our People's Air Force immediately took off to intercept and damaged one enemy aircraft.

The spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists' mad war provocations and lodged the strongest protest against this.

The two U.S. aircraft, upon invading our Guangxi Dongxing Multi-Ethnic Autonomous County airspace at 9:10 AM on the 9th, immediately strafed the ground indiscriminately and fired multiple rockets, injuring three of our commune members, killing one ox, and damaging two houses. Our People's Air Force immediately rose to intercept the enemy aircraft and damaged one of them. Seeing the situation turn unfavorable, the enemy aircraft hastily jettisoned its auxiliary fuel tank and rockets that had not yet been fired, then fled in disarray.

Prior to this, on September 5th at 3 AM, U.S. bandit aircraft also invaded our airspace in the southwestern border region of Youyi Pass, dropping several bombs.

The spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense pointed out: The U.S. imperialists' brazen and repeated invasions of our airspace, along with their indiscriminate bombing and strafing, are not accidental. This is another serious war provocation by the U.S. imperialists against the Chinese people as they escalate their aggression in Vietnam. This cannot but arouse the great indignation and serious vigilance of the entire Chinese people. We must sternly warn the U.S. aggressors: the heroic Chinese people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, are not afraid of any war threats. We are standing by, fully prepared. If you insist on a showdown, then come on! The iron fists of 700 million Chinese people will smash the aggressors to pieces.

On September 5th at 3 AM, U.S. imperialist bandit aircraft dropped several bombs in the southwestern border region of Guangxi Youyi Pass. This is the casing of a U.S. imperialist bomb (cluster bomb) that fell in the Kaofeng Commune's Nangwei Village. The upper right image shows the trademark on the cluster bomb casing, with words such as "General Dynamics Corporation," "U.S. Air Force," and "serial number."

On September 9th, the invading U.S. aircraft in Guangxi Dongxing Multi-Ethnic Autonomous County airspace were damaged by our People's Air Force and fled in disarray. This is the remaining wreckage of the rockets they jettisoned.

    新华社十六日讯　美帝国主义F—105型战斗机两架，九日上午悍然侵入我广西东兴各族自治县上空，疯狂扫射我村庄和正在劳动的公社社员。我人民空军当即起飞迎击，打伤敌机一架。
    我国防部发言人愤怒谴责美帝国主义这种疯狂的战争挑衅行为，并且就此提出最强烈的抗议。
    这两架美机，在九日九时十分一侵入我广西东兴各族自治县上空，就对地面疯狂扫射，并发射火箭多枚，打伤我公社社员三人，打死耕牛一头，打坏房屋两间。我人民空军立即奋起截击敌机，当即击伤其中一架。敌机见势不妙，仓惶扔掉副油箱和还没有来得及发射的火箭，就狼狈逃窜。
    在这以前，九月五日三时，美国强盗飞机还侵入我友谊关西南边境地区上空，投下炸弹数枚。
    我国防部发言人指出：美帝国主义这样肆无忌惮地连续侵入我国领空，疯狂轰炸扫射，决不是偶然的。这是美帝国主义在加紧扩大侵略越南战争的同时，对中国人民进行的又一次严重的战争挑衅。这不能不引起全中国人民的极大愤慨和严重警惕。我们要严正警告美国侵略者：用伟大毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的中国人民，是不怕任何战争威胁的。我们正在严阵以待，如果你们一定要较量的话，那就来吧！七亿中国人民的铁拳一定会把侵略者砸得粉碎。（附图片）
