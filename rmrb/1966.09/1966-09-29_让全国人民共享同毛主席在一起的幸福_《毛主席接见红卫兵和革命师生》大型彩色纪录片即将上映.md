The great deed of our great leader Chairman Mao receiving 500,000 Red Guards and revolutionary students from all parts of the country and the capital on August 31 has been filmed by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio into a large-scale color documentary film. Starting from September 30, it will be shown successively in the capital and various parts of the country.

Following the large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao with the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army," this film, titled "Chairman Mao Receives Red Guards and Revolutionary Students," will allow the revolutionary masses throughout the country to once again share with the young comrades on the screen the joy of being with Chairman Mao and gain new, great revolutionary spiritual strength.

The screen shows the Tiananmen Square with red flags waving, millions of Red Guards wearing red armbands singing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and reciting "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with fervor, turning the square into a surging sea of red. When millions of pairs of eyes filled with deep affection gaze at Tiananmen, awaiting the most joyful moment, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders, arrive at Tiananmen Square in an open-top car. Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, is radiant and full of vigor, waving frequently to the joyful and leaping revolutionary youngsters. Wherever Chairman Mao's car goes, it stirs up a surge of excitement, and thunderous cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" erupt.

The film leads the audience to Tiananmen Gate Tower. As the music "The East Is Red" plays, the screen shows our great leader Chairman Mao again. More than 300 Red Guards and revolutionary students invited to ascend Tiananmen Gate Tower are like sunflowers turning towards the sun, closely gathering around Chairman Mao. They present Chairman Mao with red scarves and Red Guard armbands and, together with the revolutionary youngsters on the square, enthusiastically cheer for Chairman Mao, wishing Chairman Mao eternal youth.

The moving scenes of Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai delivering speeches that received a warm response from the entire audience, as well as the shots of Red Guards and revolutionary students representatives solemnly swearing allegiance to Chairman Mao, all appear on the screen.

Workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guard audiences who have seen the preview all say that this film vividly recreates the touching scenes of Chairman Mao's heart-to-heart connection with the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary masses' boundless love for Chairman Mao. They express their determination to continue to forge ahead bravely, to contribute all their strength to achieving greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to completing the Third Five-Year Plan of the state.

    影片把观众引向天安门城楼。随着《东方红》乐曲声奏起，银幕上又出现了我们的伟大领袖毛主席。应邀登上天安门城楼的三百多名红卫兵和革命师生仿佛朵朵葵花迎向太阳，紧紧围拢在毛主席身边。他们给毛主席佩戴红领巾和红卫兵袖章，和广场上的革命小将一起向毛主席热烈欢呼，祝毛主席万寿无疆。
