Farmers in the rural communes of Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and the suburban areas of Beijing are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasping revolution and promoting production, and have launched a high-tide of high-standard winter wheat planting.

These five provinces and one municipality are the main production areas for winter wheat in our country, with the winter wheat planting area generally accounting for more than 60% of the national winter wheat area. This year, the wheat planting plans and the already implemented wheat planting areas in each province and municipality have all expanded compared to last year.

This year, the wheat planting situation in each province and municipality is better than any other year. In the midst of the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, the vast number of rural cadres and commune members have become even more conscious of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide autumn sowing, striving to complete the wheat planting task at a high standard, and ensuring the dual victories of revolution and production.

This year, the material and technical preparations for wheat planting in various places are more adequate than in previous years. First of all, the achievements in learning from Dazhai, developing water conservancy, and building Dazhai-style farmland are significant. The entire province of Shanxi can expand its watered wheat fields from 3.6 million mu last year to 6 million mu this year, and the newly built Dazhai-style farmland for wheat planting can reach 4 million mu. The completion of these 10 million mu of guaranteed high-yield wheat fields has laid the foundation for Shanxi's wheat harvest next year. This summer and autumn, Shandong experienced a shortage of rain, and many wheat fields had to be sown under drought conditions. Currently, various places are concentrating their efforts on drilling wells and digging springs. Just in the Jining area, more than 5,000 wells have already been drilled. The ridged fields, terrace fields, and watered fields for wheat planting in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong this year will all increase significantly compared to previous years. The base fertilizer prepared for wheat planting in various places is also relatively sufficient, and many regions have increased the amount of fertilizer per mu compared to previous years. Henan has also developed a considerable amount of green manure, and this year the wheat fields with pressed green manure can reach more than 80 million mu. The wheat seeds prepared by various communes are also very sufficient, and the area of high-quality seeds will be further expanded.

Today is the Autumnal Equinox. From the Autumnal Equinox to the Cold Dew is the main wheat planting season for this vast region. Now, various places have begun to enter the busy wheat planting season.

    一手抓革命　一手抓生产
    北方六省市大种冬小麦
    据新华社二十三日讯河南、山东、河北、陕西、山西五省和北京市郊区农村广大人民公社社员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，掀起了高标准的大种冬小麦的生产高潮。
    这五省一市是我国冬小麦的主要产区，冬小麦播种面积一般占全国冬小麦面积百分之六十以上。今年，各省、市种麦计划和已经落实的种麦面积都比去年扩大。
    今年各省、市种麦形势比以往任何一年都好。在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，广大农村干部和社员，更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅秋种，争取高标准地完成种麦任务，保证革命、生产双胜利。
    今年各地种麦的物质技术准备也比往年充分。首先是学大寨，兴修水利和建设大寨式农田的成绩很大。山西全省的水地小麦可由上年度的三百六十万亩扩大到六百万亩，新修的用以种麦的大寨式农田可达四百万亩。这一千万亩保收高产麦田的建成，就为山西明年小麦丰收奠定了基础。山东今年夏秋雨水不足，不少麦田要抗旱播种。现在各地正集中力量打井挖泉，仅济宁专区就已打井五千多眼。河北、河南、山东今年播种小麦的条田、台田和水地都将比往年增加很多。各地准备的种麦基肥也比较充足，很多地区每亩施肥量比往年增多。河南还发展了不少绿肥，今年压绿肥的麦田可达八百多万亩。各地社队准备的麦种也很充分，良种面积将进一步扩大。
    今天是秋分节。从秋分到寒露是这一广大地区种麦的主要季节。现在，各地已开始进入播种大忙。
