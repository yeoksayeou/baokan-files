“To succeed in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the key is to trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and respect the masses’ initiative.”

— Communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

Great teacher,
Great leader,
Great helmsman,
Great commander,
Long live Chairman Mao!

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Under the personal leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, an unprecedented wave of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging across our country.

On August 18, our beloved leader Chairman Mao, together with a million revolutionary masses from Beijing and all over the country, held a grand rally to celebrate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the majestic Tiananmen Square.

At five o’clock in the morning, our great leader Chairman Mao, dressed in a cotton uniform, came among the revolutionary masses. The crowd was in a frenzy, and everyone cheered: Chairman Mao has come! Chairman Mao is among us!

Dear Chairman Mao, you are the one who trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the masses’ revolutionary movement the most. You are in our hearts as the reddest red sun.

We shook hands with Chairman Mao, and we are the happiest people. Dear Chairman Mao, your hand gave us endless warmth, endless confidence, and strength.

Our great leader Chairman Mao wore a military uniform, and we felt even more intimate. Chairman Mao will always fight alongside us. With our great commander Chairman Mao, we feel endless happiness. We will be good soldiers of Chairman Mao for life and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

Before the rally began, people seized the time to study Chairman Mao’s quotations. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Anyone who opposes it, we will fight to the end.

We wrote down our resolve on paper and kept it in our hearts. Dear Chairman Mao, today we are with you, and this is our greatest happiness, a day we will never forget.

Tens of thousands of Red Guards wearing red armbands participated in the rally.

The Red Guards are revolutionary mass organizations created by Beijing’s college and high school students during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They dare to venture, dare to act, dare to revolt, and dare to rebel. They have the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. They are the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution. They are the future and hope of the proletarian revolution. One thousand five hundred Red Guards and revolutionary students from Beijing and all over the country ascended the Tiananmen Gate Tower to participate in the rally with Party and state leaders.

Chairman Mao, along with Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai, received the Red Guards and revolutionary students in batches on the Tiananmen Gate Tower.

Our most beloved Chairman Mao, we have been longing for you day and night, hoping to see you. Today, we have come to your side. Dear Chairman Mao, your health is our greatest happiness for the people of the whole country and the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the whole world. A thousand words and ten thousand songs cannot express our love for you. We sincerely wish you longevity!

Dear Chairman Mao, we will always remember your teachings: eternal revolution, and always keep our guns ready. It is you who have led us from victory to victory. Today, you are leading us in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will make the revolutionary flames burn even brighter, burn down the old world, and burn down the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes’ thoughts.

Party and state leaders and other patriotic democratic personages attended the rally.

Comrade Chen Boda, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, delivered the opening speech: (on-site recording)

Comrade Lin Biao spoke: (on-site recording)

Comrade Zhou Enlai spoke: (on-site recording)

Representatives of revolutionary teachers and students from Beijing University, Nie Yuanzi, spoke.

Students from Beijing, Changsha, and Nanjing spoke at the rally, expressing the boundless love of hundreds of millions of revolutionary teachers and students across the country for our great leader Chairman Mao, and their resolve to act according to the Party Central Committee’s “Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,” to firmly uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao received us Red Guards again.

Dear Chairman Mao, you care the most about the growth of our younger generation. You have told us: “The world belongs to you, and it also belongs to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You young people are full of vigor and vitality, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you.”

Dear Chairman Mao, we pledge to you: we will not let you down! We will always follow you, generation after generation, forever loyal.

Dear Chairman Mao, we know that the torch of revolution must be passed on to us, the revolutionary successors, and the red flag of revolution must be carried by us, the revolutionary successors. Today, we are the masters of the Cultural Revolution. We have the ambition and the courage to face storms and waves. We will follow the revolutionary course you have opened for us and temper and grow in the great waves of class struggle.

Premier Zhou and we sang together.

A Red Guard from Beijing Normal University Affiliated Girls’ School, Song Binbin, put a Red Guard armband on Chairman Mao. Dear Chairman Mao, you are our commander, and we will always be your Red Guards.

Chairman Mao asked her name, and she said, “Song Binbin.” Chairman Mao asked, “Is it the ‘Bin’ in ‘wenzi binbin’ (cultivated and refined)?” She said, “Yes.” Chairman Mao said, “We need to be martial!”

Dear Chairman Mao, we remember your words! Today, we resolve to take up the guns of our revolutionary predecessors and defend our socialist homeland. We dare to venture, dare to act, dare to revolt, and dare to rebel. With you as our commander, we fear nothing. We dare to climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire. We will follow you in revolution for life. We will smash the old world to pieces and build a new world of the proletariat.

Dear Chairman Mao, we pledge to you: we will definitely be the red successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Imperialists and revisionists dream of using peaceful evolution to change the color of our second and third generations, but this is utterly impossible! We have the great Chairman Mao, and we have the great Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely pass on and spread the great Mao Zedong Thought across the whole of China and the whole world!

Dear Chairman Mao, we accept your inspection. We firmly support the Party Central Committee’s “Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution” and the communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee. We will definitely follow your words, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao said to Comrade Lin Biao, “This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses, which has great significance for the ideological transformation of the people across the country.”

Dear Chairman Mao, we will definitely achieve ideological transformation, root out the thoughts of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and occupy all ideological positions with Mao Zedong Thought. We will always remember your teachings: revolution relies on ourselves. We must educate ourselves, liberate ourselves, and rise up in revolution.

Dear Chairman Mao, you have taught us: “The world belongs to you. The future of China belongs to you.” “Our hope is placed on you.” Your teachings, we will never forget. No matter how many difficulties and dangers there are, we are fearless. We will always follow you and never forget that we are the sons of the working people. We will definitely be proletarian revolutionaries, dare to venture, dare to act, dare to revolt, and dare to rebel against all exploiting classes and the old world. We will never let you down.

Dear Chairman Mao, you are the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of all nationalities. The hearts of all nationalities are with you, forever with you, and will carry the revolution through to the end.

Dear Chairman Mao, you are the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. It is you who have brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage.

We have boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for the great Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao’s call to further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and passing it down from generation to generation.

Dear Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by you is a great innovation in the communist movement and a great innovation in the socialist revolution. We will definitely follow your instructions and complete the glorious mission you have entrusted to us. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

Dear Chairman Mao, you are the most outstanding leader and the greatest genius of the proletariat of our time. You and the revolutionary masses are always heart to heart. You are the eternal red sun in our hearts.

The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and our great helmsman is Chairman Mao.

“We have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the most powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. We can be invincible, conquer all, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!”

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will smash bourgeois thoughts and establish Mao Zedong Thought. “We will definitely uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, build socialist China into an ironclad proletarian homeland, and complete the glorious historical mission entrusted to us by the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world.”

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live, long live, ten thousand years to our great leader Chairman Mao!
