Many African and Asian writers, after recently visiting various cities and rural areas in China, shared their common impressions with our reporters. They enthusiastically praised China as the hope of the world's proletariat, lauded the internationalist spirit of the Chinese people, and admired the Chinese people's diligence, bravery, and hardworking spirit.

	The People Who Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought Are Invincible

	Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a representative from Tanzania on the eastern coast of Africa, said: "The Chinese people have successfully applied Mao Zedong Thought in their daily work and life; the spirit of hard work and struggle of Chinese workers and peasants has left a deep impression on us." He said: "In such a short time after liberation, China has made such rapid progress in industry and agriculture, mainly because the Chinese people have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. This leads me to conclude that the Chinese people are a model for the revolutionary people of Asia and Africa."

	Salamah Obed, a representative from Syria, said: "We are happy to see that the Chinese people, under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong, not only have the Chinese revolution in mind but also the world revolution. The Chinese people deeply feel that they are not only ensuring the happiness, security, and progress of the Chinese proletariat but also feel responsible for the happiness, security, and progress of the world proletariat."

	Obed said: "The Chinese revolution is a victory achieved under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao Zedong." He also said: "While Chairman Mao Zedong is building a new China, he is also building a new world." He pointed out: "In China, everyone is working, everyone is smiling, everyone is filled with hatred towards imperialism and love for the people of the world who are fighting for liberation. Everyone holds a weapon in one hand and Chairman Mao's works in the other. The Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have generated tremendous power in all their work. Such a people are invincible."

	The Chinese People Work for the Support of the World Revolution

	Kibwe Constantine, a representative from the Congo (Leopoldville), said: "The Chinese people, who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have been fully mobilized and are ready to defend their motherland, no matter where the enemy comes from, they will annihilate it." He said: "Through conversations with Chinese workers, peasants, and students, I found that the political awareness of the Chinese people has reached a fairly high level. If imperialism dares to invade China, it will be completely annihilated. I also found that the Chinese people, whether men or women, their purpose of work is not only for their own country but also to support the world revolution. This proves that the People's Republic of China is the hope of the world proletariat."

	Kibwe Constantine also said: "Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the general line of the Chinese Communist Party, the seven hundred million Chinese people are full of vigor, and all sectors have achieved great leaps. This has caused all the ghosts and snakes to be in a state of panic. The Chinese people, in order to ensure the construction of socialism and prevent the restoration of capitalism, are launching fierce attacks on the remnants of capitalism and feudalism on the political, economic, ideological, and cultural fronts. All this has set a vivid example for the people of the world."

	The Chinese People Are Determined to Aid the Anti-Imperialist Struggles of All Countries

	G. Shao Anhu, a representative from Zimbabwe, said: "The Chinese people love Chairman Mao immensely. The Chinese people's serious study and application of Chairman Mao's works have left a deep impression." He said: "I observed that the Chinese people are determined to build socialism, defend their motherland, and aid the oppressed peoples in their struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism. The Chinese people are the true friends of all peace-loving people in the world."

	Shaukat Siddiqui, a representative from Pakistan, enthusiastically praised the internationalist spirit of the Chinese people, saying: "The Chinese people wholeheartedly support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation and support all revolutionary movements for national liberation and freedom in the world, and support the Kashmiri people's struggle for self-determination. Because the Chinese people regard these struggles as just."

	Tanzanian representative Yahya Mohammed Hassanani said: "The friendship between the people of Tanzania and China is the deepest and most solid, like a rock."

	He emphasized: "The people of Tanzania cannot let others choose friends for Tanzania; Tanzania's friends should be chosen by the Tanzanian people themselves."

	Mao Zedong Thought Is the Red Sun for All Revolutionary People

	Malayan writer Sharmah said: "Thank the seven hundred million Chinese people for giving the people of the world revolutionary movement the red sun of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for all revolutionary people. Thank the seven hundred million Chinese people for supporting all oppressed peoples, especially supporting the Malayan people in smashing 'Malaysia' and achieving true independence of Malaya."

	Lao representative Zalen Ongsang said: "The Chinese people have deep affection for the Lao people. Whether in factories or people's communes, whether children or the elderly, they all know that the Lao people are fighting against the Americans. This proves that the Chinese people truly support and care about the revolutionary struggle of the Lao people. I am deeply convinced that the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the Lao people is unbreakable by any force in the world."

	Syrian representative Zadatt Rikabi said: "The Chinese people regard guests from Africa and Asia as their comrades-in-arms. Here, there is not a hint of hypocrisy; the hearts of all Chinese people are open to you, and you can see smiles everywhere, and young men and women waving flowers to you." He said: "The Chinese people are loyal people, the most reliable friends."

    亚非作家赞扬毛主席教导下的中国人民胸怀世界革命
    中国是全世界无产阶级的希望
    七亿人民对世界革命人民充满热爱对帝国主义充满仇恨
    据新华社十二日讯　许多亚非作家不久前访问我国城乡广大人民后，向本社记者谈到他们的共同感受。他们热烈赞扬中国是全世界无产阶级的希望，赞扬中国人民的国际主义精神，赞扬中国人民勤劳、勇敢、艰苦奋斗的高尚品德。
  高举毛泽东思想红旗的人民是不可战胜的
    来自非洲东海岸的坦桑尼亚代表穆罕默德·阿里·赫迈迪说：“中国人民成功地将毛泽东思想运用在他们的日常工作和生活中；中国工人和农民艰苦奋斗的精神，给我们留下了深刻的印象。”他说：“中国在解放后这样短的时间里，在工业和农业方面取得了如此迅速的发展，主要是因为中国人民用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑。这些使我得出结论：中国人民是亚非革命人民的榜样。”
    叙利亚代表萨拉马赫·奥贝德说：“我们高兴地看到中国人民在毛泽东主席的教导下，脑子里不但有中国革命，而且还有世界革命。中国人民深深感到他们不仅在确保中国无产阶级的幸福、安全和进步，而且感到在确保世界无产阶级的幸福、安全和进步中的责任。”
    奥贝德说：“中国的革命，是在毛泽东思想和毛泽东主席的领导下取得胜利的。”他还说：“毛泽东主席在建设一个新的中国的同时，正在建设着一个新的世界。”他指出：“在中国，每个人都在工作，每个人都在微笑，每个人对帝国主义都充满了仇恨，对全世界争取解放的人民都充满了热爱。每个人都一手拿着武器，一手拿着毛主席的著作。中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在各项工作中产生了巨大威力。这样的人民是不可战胜的。”
      中国人民为支援世界革命而工作
    刚果（利）代表基布韦·康士坦丁说：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民，已经全民动员起来了，并且已经准备好为了保卫祖国，不管敌人从哪里来都要把它消灭掉。”他说：“我通过同中国工人、农民和学生的谈话，发现中国人民的政治觉悟已经达到相当高的水平。如果帝国主义一旦侵略中国，它将被全部消灭掉。我还发现，中国人民，无论是男人、女人，他们工作的目的，不单单是为了自己的祖国，也是为了支援世界革命。这证明，中华人民共和国是全世界无产阶级的希望。”
    基布韦·康士坦丁还说：“七亿中国人民在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在中国共产党的总路线的指引下，干劲冲天，各行各业都获得了大跃进。这些使一切牛鬼蛇神一片惊慌。中国人民为了保证社会主义建设，防止资本主义复辟，正在政治、经济、思想和文化战线上，向资本主义和封建主义的残余猛烈开火。这一切都为全世界人民作出了生动的表率。”
    中国人民决心援助各国人民反帝斗争
    津巴布韦代表格·绍安胡说：“中国人民无限热爱毛主席。中国人民那样认真地学习和运用毛主席著作，给人留下了深刻的印象。”他说：“我观察到中国人民决心建设社会主义、保卫祖国、援助被压迫人民进行反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。中国人民是世界上一切爱好和平人民的真正朋友。”
    巴基斯坦代表肖卡特·西迪基热情赞扬中国人民的国际主义精神说：“中国人民完全是真心诚意地支持越南人民抗美救国斗争，支持世界上一切争取民族解放和自由的革命运动，支持克什米尔人民争取自决权的斗争。因为中国人民认为这些斗争是正义的。”
    坦桑尼亚代表叶海雅·穆罕默德·哈桑尼说：“坦桑尼亚人民和中国人民之间的友谊是最深厚的，它像岩石般地牢固。”
    他强调说：“坦桑尼亚人民不能让别人来为坦桑尼亚选择朋友，坦桑尼亚的朋友应该由坦桑尼亚人民自己来挑选。”
    毛泽东思想是所有革命人民的红太阳
    马来亚作家沙尔玛说：“感谢七亿中国人民给予世界革命人民以毛泽东思想的红太阳，毛泽东思想是所有革命人民的指路明灯。感谢七亿中国人民支持所有被压迫人民，特别是支持马来亚人民粉碎‘马来西亚’、实现马来亚的真正独立的斗争。”
    老挝代表扎伦·翁桑昂说：“中国人民对老挝人民是有深情厚谊的。不论在工厂或人民公社，不论是小朋友，还是老年人，他们都知道老挝人民正在同美帝进行斗争。这证明中国人民是真心实意地支持和关心老挝人民的革命斗争的。我深信，中国人民和老挝人民之间的战斗友谊，是世界上任何力量都破坏不了的。”
    叙利亚代表扎达特·里卡比说：“中国人民把来自非洲和亚洲的客人看作是他们的战友。在这里，没有丝毫的虚情假意，所有中国人民的心都向你敞开着，到处都能看到微笑，看到男女青年手持鲜花向你挥舞。”他说：“中国人民是忠诚的人民，是最可靠的朋友。”
