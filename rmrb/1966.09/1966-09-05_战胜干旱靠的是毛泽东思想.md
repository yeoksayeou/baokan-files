Recently, our area experienced a drought, but it did not defeat us. The fundamental reason is that we studied Chairman Mao's works, abandoned the idea of hoping for the best, and resolutely fought against the drought. As a result, we achieved the following: all 80 mu of rice in our brigade have sufficient water and fertilizer, and are growing vigorously.

We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget them in any situation. If we forget, we will definitely encounter setbacks and take detours. Our fight against the drought this time is a good example. When the drought first appeared, we did not follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "abandoning illusions and preparing for struggle." Instead, we harbored illusions and had a lucky mindset, thinking that there was still water in the rice fields and that it might rain in a few days, so we decided to wait and see. Days passed, and it was still sunny every day with no sign of rain. By mid-July, some fields had less water, and some had started to dry up. This is when we panicked, realizing that our previous thoughts were illusions and wrong. Farming for the revolution means that the revolution cannot be smooth sailing. When it is dry, we fight against the sky. How can we rely on the sky? We acknowledged our mistake and immediately corrected it. We convened a meeting of the community members and studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "Abandoning Illusions and Preparing for Struggle," as well as relevant quotations. Using Chairman Mao's instructions, we compared them with our own thoughts, and everyone became clear-minded. We all realized that we should not have waited; waiting until the fields dried up would require more labor and time to fight the drought. Fortunately, it was not too late. Let's get to work! Finally, everyone decided to carry forward the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who Moved the Mountains, fight against the sky, fight against the earth, fight the drought, and ensure a bumper harvest.

With Mao Zedong Thought leading the way, the lucky mindset is swept away! Revolutionary enthusiasm is rising. The entire brigade, men, women, old, and young, all took action. They scooped water, transported water; patted the fields to prevent leakage; found water sources... Many poor and lower-middle peasants took the lead. Poor peasant woman Lu Maozhi had a foot injury, and we advised her to rest, but she refused, saying, "Seeing the fields about to dry up, how can I rest?" She bandaged her injury, rolled up her pants, and went to the fields to pat the fields. The Young Communist League member Lu Maoji led a few community members to walk through the valleys and streams, finding five large and small water sources, providing water for eight or nine mu of rice fields that had no water. We took action like this, fighting continuously, basically holding off the drought. But we are not satisfied with this. When studying Chairman Mao's works, many community members said that we should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, not be complacent with a little success, and persist in long-term drought prevention and resistance. We will not stop fighting the drought until we achieve a bumper harvest.

We say: This time, we were able to overcome the drought thanks to Mao Zedong Thought.

    战胜干旱靠的是毛泽东思想
    贵州省仁怀县中枢公社严家土生产队队长  赵吉三  贫协组长  熊少明
    最近我们这儿出现了伏旱，可是没有旱倒我们。最根本的一条，是我们读了毛主席的书，去掉侥幸思想，坚决同伏旱作了斗争。结果斗出了一个：全队八十亩水稻，水足肥饱，生长旺盛。
    毛主席的教导要牢牢记，时时事事都不能忘。一忘嘛，就肯定会碰钉子，走弯路。我们这次抗伏旱就是个很好的证明。当伏旱刚刚露头的时候，我们没有照毛主席教导的“丢掉幻想，准备斗争”去做，相反抱有幻想，存有侥幸心理，认为稻田里还有水，说不定过几天就下雨啦，等等再说吧！就这样的等呀等，一天一天的过去，还是天天大太阳，没有一点要下雨的样子。到七月中旬，有些田水量下降，有些田开始脱水。这下，我们才着慌啦，晓得原来的想法是幻想，是错误的。种田为革命，革命就不可能一帆风顺。天旱就同天斗，靠天怎么能靠得住！承认错误，立刻改正，我们当即召集社员，在一块再次学习毛主席写的“老三篇”和《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章以及有关语录，用毛主席的指示，跟自己的思想一对照，个个眼明心亮。都认为：原本就不该等，等到田脱水，要多花抗旱劳力和时间。幸好还不算太晚，赶快干吧！最后，大家决心发扬愚公移山的精神，与天斗，与地斗，战伏旱，保丰收。
    毛泽东思想挂了帅，侥幸思想一扫光！革命干劲起来了。全队男女老少，一齐出动。戽水，车水；捶糊田坎防渗漏；找水源……，许多贫农下中农一马当先。贫农女社员卢茂芝脚疼，我们劝她休息，她不肯，说：“眼看田快脱水，我怎么能闲得住嘛！”她把疼处包扎好，裤脚一挽就下田捶糊田坎去啦。共青团员卢茂江领着几个社员，走湾串沟，找出大小五股水源，使没有水灌的八九亩稻田有了水。我们就这样分头出动，连续奋战，基本上抗住了伏旱。但我们并不就此满足，学习毛主席著作的时候，许多社员都说，我们要照毛主席的教导，有点成绩，不要自满，要坚持长期防旱、抗旱，丰收不到手，抗旱不罢休。
    我们说：这次能战胜伏旱，靠的是毛泽东思想。
