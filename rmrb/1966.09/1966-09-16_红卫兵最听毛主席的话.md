The Red Guards Listen Closely to Chairman Mao
	Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!

	On September 15, Tiananmen Square and the streets on either side were a sea of red flags and a sea of jubilation. Hundreds of thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country and the capital gathered here to await the reception by the great leader Chairman Mao. On the square and the viewing stands, people saw emancipated serfs from Tibet, university students from the north and south of the Tian Mountains, and Tajik students from Hainan Island. There were also Red Guards from Xiamen University on the front line of the coastal defense and revolutionary youngsters from all over the country.

	Some of them arrived at Tiananmen Square at one o'clock in the morning, gazing at the portrait of Chairman Mao on Tiananmen, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, and singing "The East Is Red" until dawn.

	At 5:15 in the afternoon, the majestic and grand melody of "The East Is Red" began to play. The moment that everyone had been eagerly awaiting, day and night, had finally arrived.

	"Chairman Mao has come! Chairman Mao has come!"

	"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

	When Chairman Mao appeared on the Tiananmen Gate Tower with a vigorous stride, the hundreds of thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary students on the square erupted in excitement. People raised high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," forming a vast red sea, surging and rolling, wave after wave.

	At this moment of universal joy, the Red Guards from Yunnan City in the distant southwestern border, Kunming City's Zunyi Middle School, remembered their comrades' instructions and took out a banner they had hurriedly made overnight, which read, "Wishing the most respected Chairman Mao a long life." The red banner quickly passed from one Red Guard to another, moving forward. Many Red Guards took out letters wrapped in red paper from their backpacks and inner clothes. These letters were written by their classmates or parents. Each envelope was neatly inscribed with "For Chairman Mao's personal collection." Each letter contained a heart full of loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao!

	High Shengming, a student from the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, is the son of a poor peasant. Before coming to Beijing, he visited Yangjialing, Wangjiaoping, and Zaoyuan, where Chairman Mao had stayed, and had heart-to-heart talks with old poor peasants and old Red Guards. These old poor peasants and old Red Guards had followed Chairman Mao in his southern and northern campaigns, had talked with Mao by the Yanhe River, and had been guests in Mao's cave dwelling. When they talked about Chairman Mao, tears of longing welled up in their eyes. An old Red Guard, seventy-five years old, seeing Chairman Mao's portrait, wanted to chat with Mao. He said, "Chairman Mao loves the people, and the people love Chairman Mao." He asked High Shengming to convey the people of Yan'an's love for Chairman Mao. At this moment, High Shengming, seeing Chairman Mao, looking at Mao's robust body and radiant smile, burst into a shout from the bottom of his heart: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

	On the Tiananmen Gate Tower

	On the Tiananmen Gate Tower, three hundred Red Guards from all over the country stood with Chairman Mao. How great a happiness it was to be so close to Chairman Mao! Was this a dream? No, the sun was shining brightly in the sky, and Chairman Mao was indeed with us.

	Jiao Shuyun, the daughter of Chairman Mao's good student Comrade Jiao Yulu, a Little Red Guard from Lankao, ran to Chairman Mao's side. A comrade next to him said to Chairman Mao, "She is Comrade Jiao Yulu's daughter." Chairman Mao smiled and held her hand, and together with Comrade Lin Biao, took a photo with her.

	Jiao Shuyun said emotionally, "Meeting Chairman Mao is my greatest happiness. I will definitely follow my father's example, study Chairman Mao's works diligently, and always listen to Chairman Mao's words, becoming Chairman Mao's good student."

	Chen Baohong, a Red Guard from the Guizhou mountains where Chairman Mao passed through during the Long March, spoke on behalf of the revolutionary students of the Southwest region at the meeting. As she walked to the microphone, she shouted, "The most respected leader, Chairman Mao," and tears of joy streamed down her face. She was so excited that she could not continue.

	At this moment, the countless Red Guards standing on Tiananmen and the square were also teary-eyed, shouting enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	Our great leader fully understood her feelings, walked to her side, and gently patted her shoulder, encouraging her to continue.

	Chen Baohong, trying to control her excitement, said, "I always think of our greatest leader Chairman Mao. I often dream of our most respected leader Chairman Mao... Most respected leader Chairman Mao: Seeing you, I have gained boundless strength."

	Before liberation, Chen Baohong's parents both worked for landlords, and her brothers, sisters, and a younger sister had all been tormented to death by the old society. It was our most respected leader Chairman Mao who saved her family from the sea of suffering and turned her from a little girl into a university student of the working people.

	Now, Chen Baohong on the Tiananmen Gate Tower, on behalf of millions of working people and the children of the working people—the Red Guards, made a vow: "I will definitely redouble my efforts to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, listen to Chairman Mao's words for life, and always follow Chairman Mao's instructions honestly and earnestly. I will forever be Chairman Mao's little red soldier, following Chairman Mao in the great waves of class struggle and marching forward bravely!"

	Firmly grasp the direction of the struggle

	The vast number of Red Guards and revolutionary students have deep feelings for our great proletarian dictatorship state. The strong proletarian dictatorship has brought them the right to be masters of the country and an unlimited future.

	Tawang, a student from the Tibet Nationalities Institute, was a serf at the age of seven. Before the democratic reform in Tibet, he had run away more than ten times to see Chairman Mao and find the Golden Mother (the PLA), but was always caught and brought back by the serf owners. This time, he finally came to Beijing with the boundless love of the million emancipated serfs of Tibet for Chairman Mao.

	The night before, hearing that Chairman Mao would receive revolutionary students, Tawang did not sleep all night. Sometimes he gazed at Chairman Mao's portrait, sometimes he recited Chairman Mao's quotations, his heart filled with immense excitement. When he finally saw Chairman Mao, whom he had longed for day and night, his blood boiled, and he said, "Today is the happiest and most unforgettable day of my life. I will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, sweeping away the capitalist-roaders in power and all ghosts and monsters, defending the Party Central Committee, defending Chairman Mao, defending our iron-clad mountains and rivers, and carrying out the Cultural Revolution to the end."

	Loving our socialist motherland and strengthening and consolidating our proletarian dictatorship is the heartfelt wish of the people of our country. The Red Guards attending the meeting spoke for the people of the whole country:

	"We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and bombard the capitalist-roaders in power!"

	"Bombard the headquarters, the cannon must be accurately aimed, the target must be precise, and the strike must be fierce, to defeat the capitalist-roaders in power completely."

	"A small handful of reactionary bourgeois elements and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists want to fish in troubled waters and reverse the situation. We will never allow it. The iron-clad mountains and rivers of the proletariat will only make these clowns smash their heads and be crushed to pieces!"

	"The workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the Cultural Revolution, and the revolutionary students are the vanguard. Our goals are the same, and our directions are consistent. We must unite and fight under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

	Students from Beijing Agricultural University said, "The poor and lower-middle peasants sent us to school, hoping that we would become socially conscious and cultured laborers. We must not disappoint their hopes, always remember our roots, and be good sons of the working people."

	Students from the half-work, half-study university in Zhanjiang said, "The working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao and have the most steadfast stance. We should learn from them and together with them uproot the roots of capitalist restoration."

	The meeting ended, and everyone quickly spread the good news of Chairman Mao's reception to their classmates and relatives, sharing their happiness. Many students that night directly went from Tiananmen Square to Beijing Railway Station. Initially, their hearts flew from all over the country to Beijing; now, their hearts flew back to their schools. They were filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, determined to sow the seeds of Mao Zedong Thought all over the country, following the direction of the cultural revolution indicated by Chairman Mao, uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and with all revolutionary comrades, to achieve a great victory in the proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    红卫兵最听毛主席的话
        毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    九月十五日，天安门广场和两侧的大街上，一片红旗的海洋，欢腾的海洋。
    来自全国各地和首都的百万红卫兵和革命师生，在这里等待着伟大领袖毛主席的接见。在广场上和观礼台上，人们看到来自西藏的翻身农奴，来自天山南北的维吾尔族和塔吉克族的大学生，来自海南岛的印尼归国华侨学生，来自海防前线厦门大学的红卫兵和来自全国各地的革命小将。
    他们之中，有的在深夜一点钟赶到天安门广场，仰望着天安门上毛主席的画像，朗读毛主席语录，高歌《大海航行靠舵手》，直到天明。
    下午五点十五分，响起了庄严、雄伟的《东方红》的乐曲声。人们日也盼，夜也盼，最激动、最幸福的时刻来到了。
      “毛主席来了，毛主席来了！”
      “毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    当毛主席迈着雄健的步伐，出现在天安门城楼上的时候，广场上百万红卫兵和革命师生沸腾起来。人们高高举起《毛主席语录》，形成一片红色的海洋，波涛起伏，一浪高过一浪。
    在这全场欢腾的幸福时刻，来自遥远的西南边疆昆明市遵义中学的红卫兵，想起了战友们的嘱咐，把他们连夜赶制的绣着“祝最敬爱的毛主席万寿无疆”的锦旗拿出来了。红色的锦旗很快地从一个红卫兵手中传递到另一个红卫兵手中，一直向前传去。不少红卫兵都从自己的背包里、内衣里，掏出来一封封用红纸包装的信。这些信，有的是他们的同学写的，有的是他们的父母写的。个个信皮上都恭恭正正写着：“毛主席亲收”。封封信里都跳跃着一颗颗无限忠于我们伟大领袖毛主席的红心！
    革命圣地延安的同学高生明，是个贫农的儿子。来北京前，他访问了毛主席住过的杨家岭、王家坪、枣园，同老贫农、老赤卫队员一块促膝谈心。这些老贫农、老赤卫队员，有的跟随过毛主席南征北战，有的跟毛主席在延河畔谈过话，有的在毛主席的窑洞里作过客。他们谈起毛主席，思念的热泪夺眶而出。有个七十五岁的老赤卫队员，见到毛主席像就想同毛主席拉话。他说：“毛主席热爱人民，人民热爱毛主席。”他要高生明转达延安人民对毛主席的热爱。此刻，高生明见到毛主席，看到毛主席魁梧健壮的身体，红光焕发的笑脸，从心底放声欢呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
          在天安门城楼上
    天安门城楼上，三百名来自全国各地的红卫兵代表，和毛主席站在一起。他们和毛主席靠得这么近，这是多么巨大的幸福啊！这是在做梦吗？不，太阳明明在天空，毛主席明明就和我们在一起。
    毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志的女儿、从兰考来的小红卫兵焦守云，跑到了毛主席的面前。旁边的同志对毛主席说：“她是焦裕禄同志的女儿。”毛主席笑着拉住她的手，和林彪同志一起同她照了像。
    焦守云感动地说：“见了毛主席，是我最大的幸福。我一定要像爸爸那样，活学活用毛主席著作，永远听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好学生。”
    毛主席长征时经过的贵州山区的红卫兵陈保红，代表西南区的革命学生在大会上发言。当她走到扩音器前，刚刚喊了一句：“最敬爱的领袖毛主席”，幸福的热泪夺眶而出。她激动得说不下去了。
    这时，站在天安门上和广场上的千千万万红卫兵，也都含着泪花，热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    我们伟大的领袖完全了解她的感情，走到她的身旁，轻轻拍拍她的肩膀，鼓励她说下去。
    陈保红尽力克制着心里的激动说：“我时时刻刻都在想念我们最伟大的领袖毛主席，我经常做梦梦见我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席……最敬爱的领袖毛主席：我看见了您老人家，全身增添了无穷无尽的力量。”
    解放前，陈保红的父亲母亲都给地主扛活，她的哥哥姐姐和一个妹妹，都被旧社会折磨死了。是最敬爱的领袖毛主席，把她家从苦海里救了出来。把她从一个黄毛丫头，培养成为一个劳动人民的大学生。
    现在，陈保红在天安门城楼上，代表千千万万劳动人民和劳动人民的子弟——红卫兵，立下誓言：“我一定更加倍地努力活学活用毛主席著作，一辈子听毛主席的话，一辈子老老实实、认认真真照毛主席的指示办事。我要永远做毛主席的红色小兵，跟着毛主席在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进！”
      紧紧掌握斗争的大方向
    广大的红卫兵和革命师生，对我们伟大的无产阶级专政的国家充满了感情。强大的无产阶级专政，给他们带来了当家作主的权利，带来了无限的前程。
    西藏民族学院的同学才旺，七岁就当农奴。西藏民主改革前，他为了见毛主席，找金珠玛米（解放军），曾经逃跑过十几次，都被农奴主抓了回去。这次，他终于带着西藏百万翻身农奴对毛主席的无限热爱来到北京。
    头一天晚上，听说毛主席要接见革命学生，才旺一夜没有入睡。一会儿凝视着毛主席的像片，一会儿朗读毛主席语录，心情万分激动。当他终于看到日夜想念的毛主席时，热血沸腾，他说：“今天是我一生最幸福、最难忘的日子。我要永远跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，横扫走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神，保卫党中央，保卫毛主席，保住我们铁打的江山，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
    热爱我们社会主义祖国，巩固和加强我们的无产阶级专政，是我国人民的衷心愿望。参加大会的红卫兵们，说出了全国人民心里的话：
      “我们要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，炮打走资本主义道路的当权派！”
      “炮打司令部，一定要炮位正，目标准，打得狠，把那些走资本主义道路的当权派打个落花流水。”
      “一小撮反动资产阶级分子，没有改造好的地富反坏右五类分子妄图混水摸鱼，借机翻天，我们绝不答应。无产阶级的铁打江山，只会使这些小丑碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨！”
      “工农兵是文化大革命的主力军，革命学生是急先锋。我们目标相同，方向一致，要在毛泽东思想旗帜下，团结战斗。”
    北京农业劳动大学的同学们说：“贫下中农把我们送进学校，就是希望我们成为有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者。我们一定不要辜负他们的希望，永远不忘本，做劳动人民的好儿子。”
    湛江半耕半读大学的同学们说：“工人阶级和贫下中农热爱毛主席，立场最坚定，我们应当向他们学习，和他们一起挖掉资本主义复辟的根子。”
    大会结束了，人们都以最快的速度，把毛主席接见的喜讯告诉自己的同学和亲人，让他们分享自己的幸福。很多同学当天晚上，直接从天安门广场走向北京车站。当初，他们的心从全国各地飞向北京；现在，他们的心又从北京飞回自己的学校了。他们满怀革命激情，决心在祖国各地撒遍毛泽东思想的火种，沿着毛主席指引的文化革命的大方向，和工农兵群众团结起来，和一切革命同志团结起来，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。　本报记者
