	How happy the Chinese people are! This year's National Day is approaching, and I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations to you. The people of your country are so happy! Because you have the great leader Mao Zedong. I often think, if Chairman Mao were born in Japan, that would be great! Then, Japan could be like your beautiful country, marching forward in unison.

	However, I should not indulge in such fantasies. I believe that Chairman Mao belongs not only to your country but also to all the people of the world. In Japan, we can see Chairman Mao's books, and from the radio, we can hear about Chairman Mao's deeds and examples of studying Chairman Mao's works. Now, we are strengthening our study of Chairman Mao's works. In the near future, you will see us build a good Japan, a good world.

	I originally wrote this letter to celebrate your National Day, but I couldn't help writing so much. Finally, let me once again express my congratulations on the holiday and wish you continued victories!

    中国人民是多么幸福呵！
    〔日本〕泽田
    今年的国庆节又将到来，让我向你们表示衷心的祝贺。贵国的人民是多么幸福呵！因为你们有毛泽东这样伟大的统帅。我常想，毛主席如果生在日本那有多好呢！这样的话，日本就能像贵国这个美好的国家一样，齐步前进。
    但是，我不应该沉缅于这样的空想。我认为毛主席不仅属于贵国，也属于全世界人民。在日本也可以看到毛主席的书，从广播可以听到介绍毛主席的事情和学习毛主席著作的事例。现在，我们正加强对毛主席著作的学习。在不久的将来，你们将看到我们建立一个好的日本，一个好的世界。
    我本来为了庆祝你们国庆节而写这封信，但是情不自禁地写了这样许多话。最后，让我再一次向你们表示节日的祝贺，祝你们乘胜前进！
