An illiterate old peasant, Gu Atao, has studied Chairman Mao's works so well and applied them so effectively. This is truly remarkable.

Comrade Gu Atao is indeed a new type of peasant who has armed herself with Mao Zedong Thought in the Mao Zedong era.

Chairman Mao said seventeen years ago: "The serious problem is educating the peasants." With what should we educate the peasants? It is with Mao Zedong Thought. Gu Atao has said: "Once I started reading Chairman Mao's books, I completely changed. My eyes became sharper, and I can tell good people from bad. My ears became more sensitive, and I can distinguish good words from bad. My mind became clearer, and I can tell socialism from capitalism. My thoughts improved, and I replaced my selfish heart with a red heart."

The transformation in Comrade Gu Atao proves that by instilling Mao Zedong Thought in the broad masses of peasants, the "serious problem" of educating the peasants can be solved. Once peasants master Mao Zedong Thought, their spiritual outlook will undergo a fundamental change, and they will "completely change."

Comrade Gu Atao said: "I study Chairman Mao's books and put them into practice." Her "five hearts" in studying Chairman Mao's works, with the last one being "resolute to act," have made her "eyes sharper," "ears more sensitive," "mind clearer," and "thoughts improved."

Currently, a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works is surging among our people. Mao Zedong Thought is transforming the peasants and also transforming the entire nation. Under the radiant sun of great Mao Zedong Thought, our peasants are striding forward on the revolutionary path. Recently, some foreign friends, after visiting the "contemporary Yu Gong" — the Sandstone Ridge Brigade in Shenzhou, Hebei, praised the commune members, saying: "You are creating a new world," "I have seen that Mao Zedong Thought has been grasped by the revolutionary peasants of China, producing tremendous power." Gu Atao's example also illustrates this point.

Gu Atao said: "Without Chairman Mao, there would be no Gu Atao." This means that Chairman Mao not only gave Gu Atao a happy new life but also nurtured her into a new type of peasant who is selfless and dedicated to the public. Gu Atao's progress is the result of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought has taken root, sprouted, blossomed, and borne fruit among our 700 million people. Mao Zedong Thought is nurturing revolutionary new people.

With hundreds of millions of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the doom of the old world will surely come faster, and the new world of communism will surely be born faster.

    顾阿桃为啥完全变了样？
    高松
    一个不识字的老贫农顾阿桃，把毛主席著作学得那么好，用得那么活，这是一件了不起的事情。
    顾阿桃同志不愧是毛泽东时代用毛泽东思想武装头脑的一个新型农民。
    毛主席在十七年前说过：“严重的问题是教育农民。”用什么去教育农民？那就是用毛泽东思想。顾阿桃说过：“我一读毛主席的书，完全变了样，眼睛变得尖了，好人坏人分得清了；耳朵变得灵了，好话坏话听得出了；脑子变得清了，社会主义、资本主义辨得明了；思想变得好了，私心换上了红心。”
    顾阿桃身上的这个变化，有力地证明：把毛泽东思想灌输到广大农民中去，教育农民的“严重的问题”就能解决。农民掌握了毛泽东思想，精神面貌就会发生根本的变化，就会“完全变了样”。
    顾阿桃同志说：“毛主席的书，我学了就用。”她学习毛主席著作的“五个心”，最后一个就是“决心做”。正是这个“学了就用”和“决心做”，使她“眼睛变得尖了”，“耳朵变得灵了”，“脑子变得清了”，“思想变得好了”。
    现在，一个学习毛主席著作的热潮，正在我国人民中不断高涨。毛泽东思想改变着农民的面貌，也改变着全国人民的面貌。我国的农民在伟大的毛泽东思想阳光照耀下，正沿着革命化的大道阔步前进。最近有些外国朋友访问了“当代活愚公”——河北遵化沙石峪大队后，赞扬我们人民公社的社员们说：“你们是在创造新世界”，“我看到了毛泽东思想已被中国革命的农民所掌握，产生了巨大的力量。”顾阿桃的例子，也正说明了这一点。
    顾阿桃说：“没有毛主席，就没有我顾阿桃”。这就是说，毛主席不仅给了顾阿桃幸福的新生活，还把她培育成为一个一心为公的新型农民。顾阿桃能够大步前进，是活学活用毛主席著作的结果。毛泽东思想已经在我国七亿人民中生根、发芽、开花、结果。毛泽东思想培育着革命化的新人。
    有了亿万用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，旧世界的末日必定会加速到来，共产主义的新世界必定会加速诞生。
