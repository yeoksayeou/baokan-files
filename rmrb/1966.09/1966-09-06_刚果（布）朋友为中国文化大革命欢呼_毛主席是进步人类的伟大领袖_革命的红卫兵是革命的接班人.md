From China, the Congolese (Brazzaville) Red Cross delegation leader Andre Bilonbo recently told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Brazzaville that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China further proves that "Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon illuminating the path of world revolution," and that "Chairman Mao is the wise and great leader of all progressive humanity."

He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is currently sweeping across China, is rapidly developing in factories, schools, and especially in large cities. The purpose of this cultural revolution is, on the one hand, to sweep away the remnants of feudalism, bourgeoisie, and imperialism: old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits; on the other hand, it is to raise higher the red banner of Chairman Mao Zedong's correct thoughts.

He said that the Red Guards have declared themselves to be the steadfast defenders and successors of Marxism-Leninism, enriched and developed by Chairman Mao based on the contemporary situation with his brilliant theory and experience.

He said, "The united Red Guards, standing together as one, show no mercy to certain anti-party and anti-socialist elements because these elements aim to destroy the fruits of the Chinese revolution, attempting to introduce the capitalist system into this country, and thus strive in every way to sabotage the world revolution."

He said, "The Red Guards enjoy the firm support of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals. The Red Guards crisscross the streets, holding the 'Little Red Book' of Quotations from Chairman Mao, shouting revolutionary slogans, singing songs praising the Chinese Communist Party and its great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, and changing the names of shops, streets, and public places that still reflect feudal, bourgeois, and imperialist ideology."

Bilonbo pointed out that the cultural revolution unfolding in China will make a great contribution to socialism and strengthen the anti-imperialist struggle. Therefore, Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts are not only the beacon illuminating the path of world revolution but also the telescope that can detect all obstacles on the road of Marxism-Leninism.

He said that under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, the Chinese people are filled with proletarian internationalism, providing moral and material support to all peoples suffering under the oppression and domination of international imperialism led by U.S. imperialism. Due to this unconditional support, the liberation wars in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are progressing smoothly, and U.S. imperialism is doomed to failure.

    刚果（布）朋友为中国文化大革命欢呼
    毛主席是进步人类的伟大领袖
    革命的红卫兵是革命的接班人
    新华社布拉柴维尔二日电　从中国访问归来的刚果（布）红十字会代表团团长安德烈·毕隆波最近在这里向新华社记者发表谈话说，正在中国进行的文化大革命更加证明“毛泽东思想是照亮世界革命道路的灯塔”，“毛主席是世界上所有进步人类的英明、伟大的领袖。”
    他说，目前震动着全中国的无产阶级文化大革命的风暴，正在工厂、学校、特别是大城市中急剧地开展。这场文化大革命的目的，一方面是要清除封建主义、资产阶级和帝国主义的残余：旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗和旧习惯；另一方面是要更高地举起毛泽东主席正确思想的红旗。
    他说，红卫兵“宣告自己是由毛主席根据当代的情况用他的天才的理论和经验，丰富和发展了的马克思列宁主义的坚定不移的保卫者和接班人。”
    他说，“团结得像一个人一样站出来的年轻的红卫兵，不饶恕某些反党、反社会主义分子，因为反党反社会主义分子要破坏中国革命的果实，企图把资本主义制度引进这个国家，从而千方百计地企图破坏世界革命。”
    他说，“红卫兵受到广大工农兵群众和革命知识分子的坚决支持。红卫兵穿梭在大街小巷，他们手拿《毛主席语录》，高呼革命口号，唱着歌颂中国共产党和党的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的歌曲，在各处更改还反映封建主义、资产阶级和帝国主义思想的商店、街道和公共场所的名称。”
    毕隆波指出，在中国展开的文化革命，将对社会主义作出伟大的贡献，将加强反帝斗争。因此，毛泽东主席的思想是照亮世界革命道路的灯塔，也是能发现马克思列宁主义道路上的一切障碍的望远镜。
    他说，在毛泽东主席的思想指导下的中国人民充满着无产阶级国际主义精神，他们给予在以美帝国主义为首的国际帝国主义剥削和统治下的所有人民以道义上和物质上的支持。由于这种无条件的支持，亚非拉的解放战争正在顺利进行，美帝国主义是注定要失败的。
