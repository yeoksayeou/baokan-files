Our great leader, great teacher, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, today in the afternoon, at the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our great motherland, the capital, on the magnificent and grand Tiananmen Square, once again received millions of Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country and the capital.

Today, the capital was clear and sunny. Revolutionary youngsters from universities and colleges in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as the capital, started from early morning, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and countless red flags, surging from all directions, gathering on Tiananmen Square and the broad avenues of East and West Chang'an Streets. The square was filled with flying red flags, and the revolutionary spirit surged wave after wave. Millions of hearts beat fiercely, and millions of eyes gazed at Tiananmen, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the most happy moment.

At 5:15 PM, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as other central leaders Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Chen Boda, Deng Xiaoping, Kang Sheng, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Chen Yun, Dong Biwu, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Li Xianfeng, Xie Fuzhi, and others, ascended the Tiananmen City Tower to the tune of "The East Is Red." At this moment, the entire square boiled over. Millions of hands repeatedly raised high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," under the brilliant sunlight, like rolling waves of red, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!" echoed endlessly, shaking the sky of the capital.

More than 300 revolutionary student representatives from all over the country also ascended the Tiananmen City Tower. They stood by Chairman Mao's side, excitedly cheering and jumping.

More than 10,000 revolutionary students from the military academies of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, together with the heroic Red Guards, received the inspection of the great commander Chairman Mao.

Comrade Kang Sheng, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and an advisor to the Central Cultural Revolution Group, announced the start of the meeting. He said: On behalf of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, I welcome you, greet you, and extend proletarian cultural revolutionary combat greetings to you, and through you, to revolutionary students and staff in all regions and schools across the country! He said: Our great leader Chairman Mao has come to see us. Let us shout: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Comrade Lin Biao spoke to the revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country who came to Beijing in the midst of a storm of applause.

Comrade Lin Biao first, on behalf of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, extended greetings to everyone!

He said: "Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, with the 'Sixteen Articles' formulated and presided over by Chairman Mao as the guideline, is developing victoriously across the country. The situation is very good! The situation is getting better and better!"

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Chairman Mao teaches us that the fundamental contradiction that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to resolve is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist and capitalist roads. The focus of this movement is to struggle against those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Bombarding the headquarters means bombarding a handful of people in power who are taking the capitalist road. Our country is a socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The leadership of our country is in the hands of the proletariat. Overthrowing a handful of people in power who are taking the capitalist road is precisely to consolidate and strengthen our proletarian dictatorship."

He emphasized: "It is clear that a handful of reactionary bourgeois elements, untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are different from us. They oppose the dictatorship of the broad revolutionary masses led by the proletariat. They attempt to bombard our proletarian revolutionary headquarters. Can we allow them to do so? No, we must smash their plots and tricks, expose them, and not let their plots succeed. They are only a handful of people, but sometimes they can deceive good people. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. Without this direction, we will go astray."

He said: "Now, some people violate Chairman Mao's instructions and the 'Sixteen Articles,' using the deep class feelings of the workers and peasants for the Party and Chairman Mao, to create a confrontation between the workers and peasants and revolutionary students, inciting the workers and peasants to struggle against revolutionary students. We must not fall for their tricks!"

Comrade Lin Biao called on the Red Guards and all revolutionary youth to learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to temper themselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Comrade Lin Biao finally said: "Under the leadership of our great leader, great teacher, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary students unite, and all revolutionary comrades unite, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

Comrade Zhou Enlai then spoke at the meeting. He said: "Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao's meeting with everyone is the greatest concern and encouragement for us! This is our greatest happiness and greatest glory!"

He pointed out: "With the rise of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our industrial and agricultural production is presenting a new face and new prosperity."

"We must respond to Chairman Mao's call, grasp revolution with one hand and production with the other, and ensure the double victory of the Cultural Revolution and industrial and agricultural production!"

He said: "Broad masses of workers, commune members, scientific and technical personnel, and cadres in enterprises and institutions must firmly hold their production posts, seize the production links at the right time, and channel the sky-high enthusiasm unleashed in the Cultural Revolution into industrial and agricultural production and scientific experiments!"

Comrade Zhou Enlai pointed out: "To facilitate the normal operation of industrial and agricultural production, Red Guards and revolutionary students in colleges and universities should not go to factories, enterprises, and county-level institutions and rural communes for revolutionary connections. The revolution there should be carried out according to the original 'Four Cleanups' deployment, in a planned and step-by-step manner. Factories and rural areas cannot be like schools, stopping production to carry out the revolution. Revolutionary students should respect the workers and peasants, trust the workers and peasants, and believe that the workers and peasants can rely on themselves to carry out the revolution well."

Comrade Zhou Enlai called on Red Guards and revolutionary students in colleges and universities to participate in labor in the countryside during the busy autumn harvest and planting season, to help with the harvest, and to learn the revolutionary spirit and hardworking qualities of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Representatives of the Red Guards in the capital, in their speeches, warmly welcomed revolutionary comrades from all over the country and expressed their determination to support, help, and learn from each other in the Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary student representatives from the North China, Southwest, East China, Northeast, Northwest, and Central South regions spoke at the meeting. They said:

"We have long wished to see our great leader Chairman Mao, and today our wish has finally been fulfilled. This is our greatest happiness."

"We, the people of all ethnic groups, will forever love Chairman Mao, forever listen to Chairman Mao's words, forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, and forever remember the greatest concern given to us by the great Communist Party of China and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao."

"We are the descendants of the revolution, the sons of the people. We will temper ourselves in the great storms of class struggle. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. Great leader Chairman Mao, we will follow you through the great storms, learn to swim in swimming, and learn revolution in revolution. We vow to be a generation of daring fighters, daring to struggle, daring to revolutionize, good at struggling, and good at revolutionizing!"

"We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, determined to bring back the revolutionary fighting experience of Beijing, to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the 'Sixteen Articles' everywhere, to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, to resolutely overthrow those in power who are taking the capitalist road, to sweep away all ghosts and monsters, to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our region well, and to thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism."

After the speeches at the meeting, Chairman Mao, amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the masses, walked to the east and west ends of the Tiananmen City Tower, repeatedly waving and greeting everyone. Chairman Mao received more than 300 revolutionary student representatives from all over the country on the east and west platforms of the Tiananmen City Tower and took a group photo with them.

As night fell, the Tiananmen City Tower and the surrounding square were brightly lit. The tens of thousands of revolutionary students originally on Tiananmen Square, according to the meeting's instructions, moved south in an orderly manner, allowing tens of thousands of revolutionary youngsters on the east and west sides, eager to see Chairman Mao, to enter the square.

At 8:30 PM, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as other central leaders, appeared again on the Tiananmen City Tower. Chairman Mao repeatedly waved to the broad revolutionary students and teachers. Amidst the thunderous applause and cheers, Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, as well as other central leaders, walked to the east and west ends of the Tiananmen City Tower again to meet with the broad revolutionary youngsters. At this moment, the shouts of "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!" echoed through the night sky of the capital, and the entire square presented a festive scene. Millions of revolutionary youngsters were immersed in an atmosphere of unlimited joy and happiness.

The chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists), E.F. Hill, and his wife, Joe Hill, who were visiting our country, were invited to attend the meeting. Chairman Mao warmly met them on the Tiananmen City Tower.

Other responsible persons attending the meeting included: Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Jiang Qing, Wang Renzhong, Wu De, Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Dingxun, Xiao Jinguang, Su Yu, Deng Zihui, Zhang Yunyi, Liu Xiao, Yang Xiufeng, Wu Xiuquan, Qian Ying, Xu Shiyou, Zeng Shan, Xu Haidong, Zhao Erlu, Lü Zhengcao, Wang Shusheng, Zhang Jingwu, Yang Yong, Zhang Zongxun, Li Tao, Chen Qihan, Chen Manyuan, Li Zhimin, Liu Lanbo, Su Zhenhua, Zhang Linzhi, Liao Hansheng, Xu Bing, Song Shilun, Zhong Qiguang, Chen Zhengren, Tao Luguang, Liu Jianjun, Zhao Yimin, Kong Yuan, Fang Yi, Sun Zhiyuan, Zhang Aiping, Yao Wenyuan, Peng Shaohui, Wang Xinting, Liu Zhijian, Xu Liquing, Yuan Ziqin, Zhou Shidi, Zhu Shaocai, Qiu Huizuo, Zhang Chuming, Wu Faxian, Yu Lizhui, Li Jukuai, Guo Tianmin, Zhong Chibing, Luo Xunchu, Wu Kexiang, Chen Renqi, Huang Zhiyong, Chen Shipeng, Li Tianhuan, Tan Furen, Li Shouxuan, Cui Tianmin, Cai Shungui, Kong Shiquan, Li Zuopeng, Jiang Wen, Chen Heqiao, Li Zhen, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, Huang Zuozhen, Hu Zhi, Zhang Chunqiao, Xie Fuzhi, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Mu Xin, Yao Wenyuan, Guo Moruo, He Xiangning, Yang Mingxuan, Cheng Qian, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhou Rongxin, Yu Quli, Gu Mu, Jiang Yizhen, Liu Wenhui, Lü Dong, Xu Jinqiang, Duan Junyi, Liu Jie, Wang Zhen, Qiu Chuangcheng, Fang Qiang, Wang Bingzhang, Li Siguang, Kang Sheng, Liu Yumin, Lai Ruifu, Jiang Guangnai, Qian Zhongguang, Xu Yunbei, Sun Daguan, Zhu Lianfang, Fu Zuoyi, Yuan Baohua, Sha Qianli, Lin Haichun, Xu Deheng, Xiao Wanchun, He Wei, Zhang Zhirou, Xie Fumin, Rong Haotang, Hu Lijiao, Wang Dongxing, Zeng Die, Xie Youfa, Wang Ping, Qin Huilong, Xiong Fuxi, Tang Pingzhu, Ding Laiwu, Ma Chonggu, Wang Daoyi, Yang Qiqing, Li Zhen, Yu Sang, Zhao Xinchu, Tong Xiaopeng, Gao Chongmin, Cai Tingkai, Shen Yanbing, Li Zhenchen, Jie Xuegong, Su Qianyi, Yong Wenhua, Gao Yangwen, Ma Li, etc. (with photos)

    迎接无产阶级文化大革命新高潮　迎接社会主义建设新高潮
    毛主席又一次接见百万革命小将
    林彪同志在大会上强调指出：炮打司令部，就是炮打一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。一小撮反动资产阶级分子，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右五类分子，企图炮打我们无产阶级革命的司令部。我们要粉碎这些牛鬼蛇神的阴谋诡计，识破他们，不要让他们的阴谋得逞。
    周恩来同志说：要一手抓革命，一手抓生产，保证文化革命和工农业生产双胜利
      红卫兵发出誓言：我们是革命的后代、人民的儿子，永远跟着毛主席在大风大浪中锻炼成长
    新华社十五日讯　我们的伟大领袖、伟大导师、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，今天下午在无产阶级文化大革命的中心——我们伟大祖国的首都，在雄伟壮丽的天安门广场，又一次接见了来自全国各地和首都的百万红卫兵和革命师生。
    今天，首都晴空万里。来自全国各省、市、自治区和首都的大中学校的革命小将们，从大清早起，就高举着毛主席像、毛主席语录牌和无数面红旗，意气风发地从四面八方涌来，汇集在天安门广场和东西长安街广阔的大道上。广场上，红旗飘扬，充满革命豪情的歌声，一浪高过一浪，百万颗火热的心在激烈地跳动，百万双深情的眼睛仰望着天安门，期待着一个最最幸福的时刻的到来。
    下午五时十五分，我们伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央其他领导同志周恩来、陶铸、陈伯达、邓小平、康生、刘少奇、朱德、李富春、陈云、董必武、陈毅、刘伯承、贺龙、李先念、谭震林、徐向前、聂荣臻、叶剑英、李雪峰、谢富治等，在《东方红》乐曲声中登上了天安门城楼。这时，整个广场沸腾起来。百万双手一次又一次地高高举起红色的《毛主席语录》，在灿烂的阳光照耀下，就像翻滚着红色浪涛的海洋。“毛主席万岁”“毛主席万万岁”的欢呼声，久久不息，震荡着首都的天空。
    来自全国各地的革命学生代表三百多人，也登上天安门城楼。他们在毛主席身边，激动地欢呼跳跃。
    中国人民解放军高等院校的万名革命师生，同英雄的红卫兵一起，接受伟大统帅毛主席的检阅。
    中共中央政治局常委、中央文化革命小组顾问康生同志宣布大会开始。他说：我代表中央文化革命小组欢迎你们，问候你们，向你们，并通过你们向全国各地区各学校的革命师生员工致无产阶级文化革命战斗的敬礼！他说：我们的伟大领袖毛主席来接见我们，让我们高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    林彪同志在全场暴风雨般的掌声中，向全国各地来京革命师生和红卫兵战士讲话。
    林彪同志首先代表毛主席，代表党中央，向大家问好！
    他说：“我国的无产阶级文化大革命，在毛主席领导下，以毛主席主持制定的十六条为指南，正在全国范围内胜利地向前发展。形势好得很！形势越来越好！”
    林彪同志说：“毛主席教导我们，无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的根本矛盾，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾。这次运动的重点，是斗争那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派。炮打司令部，就是炮打一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我们的国家，是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。我们国家的领导权，是掌握在无产阶级手里。斗倒一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，正是为了巩固和加强我们的无产阶级专政。”
    他强调指出：“很明显，一小撮反动资产阶级分子，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右五类分子和我们不同，他们反对无产阶级为首的广大革命人民群众对他们的专政，他们企图炮打我们无产阶级革命的司令部，我们能容许他们这样干吗？不能，我们要粉碎这些牛鬼蛇神的阴谋诡计，识破他们，不要让他们的阴谋得逞。他们只是一小撮人，但是他们有时能够欺骗一些好人。我们一定要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。离开了这个大方向，就会走到邪路上去。”
    他说：“现在，有些人违背毛主席的指示，违背十六条，利用工农群众对党对毛主席的深厚的阶级感情，制造工农群众和革命学生的对立，挑动工农群众去斗争革命学生。我们千万不要上他们的当！”
    林彪同志号召红卫兵和一切革命青少年，要向工农兵学习，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    林彪同志最后说：“在我们的伟大领袖、伟大导师、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的领导下，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，工农兵群众和革命学生团结起来，一切革命同志团结起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
    周恩来同志接着在会上讲话。他说：“我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席同大家亲切会见，这是对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞！这是我们最大的幸福，最大的光荣！”
    他指出：“随着无产阶级文化大革命高潮的兴起，我国工农业生产正在出现一个更新的面貌，更新的繁荣。”
      “我们一定要响应毛主席的号召，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，保证文化大革命和工农业生产双胜利！”
    他说：“广大的工人、公社社员、科学技术人员和机关企业干部，都应当坚守生产岗位，不失时机地掌握生产环节，把在文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天干劲，用到工农业生产和科学实验中去！”
    周恩来同志指出：“为了有利于工农业生产的正常进行，大中学校的红卫兵和革命学生，现在不要到工厂、企业单位和县以下的机关、农村人民公社去进行革命串连。那里的革命，要按照原来的‘四清’部署，有计划有步骤地进行，工厂、农村不能像学校那样放假，停止生产来搞革命。革命学生要尊重工农群众，信赖工农群众，相信工农群众完全可以依靠自己把革命搞好。”
    周恩来同志号召大中学校的红卫兵和革命师生，在秋收秋种的大忙季节，应当有组织地到农村去参加劳动，帮助秋收，学习贫下中农的革命干劲和勤劳的品质。
    首都的红卫兵代表在讲话中，热烈欢迎来自全国各地的革命战友，表示要在文化大革命中，同他们更好地互相支持，互相帮助，互相学习。
    来自华北、西南、华东、东北、西北、中南地区的革命学生代表在会上讲了话。他们说：
      “我们很长时期以来想见我们的伟大领袖毛主席的愿望，今天终于实现了。这是我们最大的幸福。”
    “我们各族人民永远热爱毛主席，永远听毛主席的话，永远跟毛主席干革命，永远不忘记伟大的中国共产党、我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席给予我们的最大的关怀。”
      “我们是革命的后代，是人民的儿子，我们要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长。我们永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民。伟大的领袖毛主席，我们一定跟着你在大风大浪中前进，在游泳中学会游泳，在革命中学会革命。誓作敢于斗争，敢于革命，善于斗争，善于革命的一代闯将！”
      “我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，决心把北京的革命斗争经验带回去，处处按照毛主席的指示办事，按照十六条办事，发扬无产阶级的革命造反精神，坚决打倒走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把本地区的无产阶级文化大革命搞好，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子。”
    大会讲话结束以后，毛主席在万众热烈欢呼声中，走向天安门城楼东西两头，不断地向大家招手致意。毛主席在天安门城楼的东西平台上接见了来自全国各地的三百多名革命学生代表，并同他们一起照了像。
    入夜，天安门城楼和广场四周灯光齐明。原在天安门广场上的数十万革命学生，按照大会的指挥，秩序井然地向南移动，让东西两侧几十万渴望见到毛主席的革命小将，进入广场。
    八时三十分，我们的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央其他领导同志，又出现在天安门城楼上。毛主席不断挥手向广大革命师生致意。在震天的鼓掌声和欢呼声中，毛主席和林彪同志，以及中央其他领导同志，又走向天安门城楼东西两头，再一次同广大革命小将见面。这时，“伟大领袖毛主席万岁，万万岁”的欢呼声，激荡着首都夜空，整个广场呈现出一片节日景象，百万革命小将沉浸在无限欢乐、无限幸福的气氛中。
    正在我国访问的澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）主席爱·弗·希尔和夫人乔·希尔，应邀出席了大会。毛主席在天安门城楼上亲切地会见了他们。
    参加大会的各方面负责人还有：刘宁一、萧华、杨成武、江青、王任重、吴德、蔡畅、邓颖超、廖承志、张鼎丞、萧劲光、粟裕、邓子恢、张云逸、刘晓、杨秀峰、伍修权、钱瑛、许光达、曾山、徐海东、赵尔陆、吕正操、王树声、张经武、杨勇、张宗逊、李涛、陈奇涵、陈漫远、李志民、刘澜波、苏振华、张霖之、廖汉生、徐冰、宋时轮、钟期光、陈正人、陶鲁笳、刘建勋、赵毅敏、孔原、方毅、孙志远、张爱萍、姚依林、彭绍辉、王新亭、刘志坚、徐立清、袁子钦、周士第、朱良才、邱会作、张池明、吴法宪、余立金、李聚奎、郭天民、钟赤兵、罗舜初、吴克华、陈仁麒、黄志勇、陈士榘、李天焕、谭辅仁、李寿轩、崔田民、蔡顺礼、孔石泉、李作鹏、江文、陈鹤桥、李真、郑维山、傅崇碧、黄作珍、胡痴、张春桥、谢镗忠、王力、关锋、戚本禹、穆欣、姚文元、郭沫若、何香凝、杨明轩、程潜、张治中、周荣鑫、余秋里、谷牧、江一真、刘文辉、吕东、徐今强、段君毅、刘杰、王诤、邱创成、方强、王秉璋、李四光、康世恩、刘裕民、赖际发、蒋光鼐、钱之光、徐运北、孙大光、朱学范、傅作义、袁宝华、沙千里、林海云、许德珩、萧望东、何伟、张奚若、谢扶民、荣高棠、胡立教、汪东兴、曾涤、谢有法、王屏、秦化龙、熊复、唐平铸、丁莱夫、马纯古、王道义、杨奇清、李震、于桑、赵辛初、童小鹏、高崇民、蔡廷锴、沈雁冰、李烛尘、解学恭、苏谦益、雍文涛、高扬文、马力等。（附图片）
