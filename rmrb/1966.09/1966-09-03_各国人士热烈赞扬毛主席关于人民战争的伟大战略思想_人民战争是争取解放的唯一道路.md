Foreign figures and public opinion in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have recently warmly praised Chairman Mao's great strategic thought on people's war, believing it to be an important treasure for the revolutionary people of all countries to defeat imperialism and reactionaries.

The representative of the Lao People's Patriotic Front in Vientiane, Tao Su, emphasized: "Chairman Mao Zedong's thought on people's war has great power, and no imperialism or reactionary forces can defeat it." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a very powerful and formidable ideological weapon for the people of all countries who are engaged in revolutionary struggles. It is an invincible spiritual atomic bomb. As long as the people of all countries rely on and master Mao Zedong Thought, and, as Chairman Mao Zedong emphasized, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, and advance bravely, then the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All demons will be annihilated."

The Syrian newspaper *Al-Ba'ath* published an article stating that Mao Zedong is a brilliant and wise military leader with high prestige. He was the first to propose a successful guerrilla warfare strategy. He led the Chinese Red Army to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and achieve great victories. The article said that the Chinese experience proves that revolutionary people can overthrow reactionary autocratic regimes through people's liberation wars. People's war is the only path to liberation and independence.

The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Damascus, Abdul Rahim, said that Chairman Mao's thought on people's war is the only way to liberate Palestine.

A freedom fighter from Azania (South Africa) in Cairo said, "The people of Africa have decided to use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence. Imperialists, despite possessing modern weapons and atomic devices, cannot stop the African people from advancing to victory. As Chairman Mao emphasized, the decisive factor in any war is not weapons but people."

The famous Mexican figure General Xara praised Chairman Mao's strategic thought, saying, "When Mao Zedong talks about the erroneous view that weapons decide everything, he succinctly expresses a great truth: Weapons alone cannot solve any problem. The ones who hold the weapons are people, and people are the most precious factor. Therefore, one must strengthen the fighting spirit of the people, educate them, and guide them to reach the highest peak of human dignity."

    各国人士热烈赞扬毛主席关于人民战争的伟大战略思想
    人民战争是争取解放的唯一道路
    本报综合报道　亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人士和舆论最近热烈赞扬毛主席关于人民战争的伟大战略思想，认为这是各国革命人民战胜帝国主义和反动派的重要法宝。
    老挝爱国战线党驻万象代表陶苏强调说：“毛泽东主席关于人民战争的思想具有伟大的威力，任何帝国主义、任何反动派都不能胜过它。”他说：“毛泽东思想对正在进行革命斗争的世界各国人民来说，是一个非常强大有力的思想武器，是不可战胜的精神原子弹。世界各国人民只要依靠并且掌握毛泽东思想，像毛泽东主席所强调指出的那样，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    叙利亚《复兴报》发表文章说，毛泽东是一位天才的、英明的享有很高威信的军事领袖。他最先提出成功的游击战争战略。他领导中国红色的解放军打败了蒋介石，取得了伟大的胜利。文章说，中国的经验证明，革命人民可以通过人民解放战争推翻反动的专制制度。人民战争是实现解放和独立的唯一道路。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻大马士革办事处主任阿卜杜勒·拉希姆说，毛主席的人民战争思想是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一途径。
    一位在开罗的阿扎尼亚（南非）自由战士说，非洲人民决定以革命的暴力来对付反革命暴力。帝国主义者尽管拥有现代化武器和原子装置，他们仍然不能阻挡非洲人民胜利前进。正如毛主席所强调指出的，任何战争中的决定性因素不是武器而是人。
    墨西哥著名人士哈拉将军赞扬毛主席的战略思想说：“毛泽东在谈到关于武器决定一切的错误观点时，以寥寥数语道出了一个伟大的真理：单有武器解决不了任何问题：掌握武器的是人，人是最宝贵的因素，为此，必须加强人的战斗精神，教育他们，引导他们来达到人类尊严的最高峰。”
