This year, nine newly constructed cotton textile mills in our country have either fully or partially started production. This is the first batch of completed projects among the large and medium-sized basic construction projects planned for this year in our country's textile industry to better meet the clothing needs of the people.

Along with these cotton mills, four other factories, including silk mills, silk fabric mills, and textile machinery factories, have also been completed and have either fully or partially started production. The nine cotton mills that have started production this year will produce an additional six hundred million meters of cloth.

The broad masses of workers undertaking the basic construction tasks this year have taken the construction site as their classroom, better studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Their revolutionary spirit is surging. They do not seek fame or personal gain, are not afraid of hardship or death, and have taken "building factories for the revolution" and "constructing revolutionary factories" as their common action slogan. They have better unleashed their enthusiasm and creativity, thereby greatly accelerating the construction speed.

During the construction process, the workers have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, carried out a revolution in construction management, and broken the old construction order. The workers have also, according to the principle of "seeking technological innovation and simplifying living conditions," better implemented the policy of frugal construction and frugal enterprise management in the construction process. In terms of living and welfare facilities, they have used local materials to build, striving to be close to the living standards of local people. Some factories have even built workers' dormitories near farmers' houses, making it convenient to strengthen the connection between workers and farmers and gradually eliminate the differences between workers and farmers, and between urban and rural areas.

    为革命盖工厂　盖革命化的工厂
    我国新建九座棉纺织厂投产
    今年以来，我国又有九座新建的棉纺织厂全部或部分投入生产。这是我国纺织工业为更好适应人民衣着需要，计划在今年施工的大中型基本建设项目中的第一批完工项目。
    跟这批棉纺厂同时建成投入生产或部分投入生产的，还有绢纺厂、丝绸厂和纺织机械厂等四个工厂。已经投入生产的九个棉纺厂，今年纺出的纱将增产六亿多尺布。
    承担今年基本建设任务的广大职工，以工地为课堂，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，革命精神大振。他们不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，以“为革命盖工厂”、“盖革命化的工厂”作为共同的行动口号，更好地发挥了自己的积极性和创造性，因而大大加快了建设速度。
    建厂职工在施工过程中，坚决按照毛主席的教导，大搞施工管理革命，打破旧的建设秩序。建厂职工还根据“技术求新、生活从简”的原则，在施工过程中更好地贯彻了勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针。在有关生活福利设施方面，他们就地取材建筑，尽量作到接近当地群众生活水平。有的工厂还把职工宿舍盖在农民住房附近，作到有利于加强工农联系，有利于逐步消灭工农差别、城乡差别。
