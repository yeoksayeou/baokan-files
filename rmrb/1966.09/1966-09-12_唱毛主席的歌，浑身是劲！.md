Early one morning last year, an old worker in the power plant was carefully reading Chairman Mao's works by the Huangpu River. When it was time for breakfast, he still did not put down the book. Just then, the sun rose over the East China Sea, and the sky was filled with red light, shining brightly. A young worker saw this moving scene and couldn't help shouting, "The red sun rises in the east, Chairman Mao's works shine with golden light!"

This incident deeply moved us. The workers in our factory, through the socialist education movement, have greatly improved their ideological awareness. They organized many study groups of Chairman Mao's works and produced many active learners. The brilliant thoughts in Chairman Mao's works inspire everyone to keep moving forward. The more you study, the more energetic you feel, and the brighter your heart becomes. The deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works naturally give rise to a strong desire to praise the Party and Chairman Mao, and to sing about Chairman Mao's works. Our amateur writers really wanted to sing out the scene of workers eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works. At this time, the Party organization also organized us to study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." After studying Chairman Mao's works, our minds became clear, and we understood why we write, generating a strong creative passion. We wrote the initial draft of the song "Chairman Mao's Works Shine with Golden Light" on this basis.

After the initial draft was written, everyone felt that both the lyrics and the melody were far from expressing our deep love for the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao. How could we improve it? We reviewed Chairman Mao's teaching that "the people have boundless creative power" and decided to take the draft to the workshop to seek advice from the workers. The workers gave us many good suggestions. For example, the original lyrics said, "Ten boats and eight boats cannot carry it all..." The workers said, "The treasures obtained from studying Chairman Mao's works, not only ten boats and eight boats cannot carry them all, even a thousand boats and ten thousand boats cannot carry them all!" In the process of creation, as long as someone had a good idea, we would immediately revise it, not constrained by any rules. We revised it more than ten times. The revised melody is more passionate, enthusiastic, and powerful.

The workers love the song "Chairman Mao's Works Shine with Golden Light" very much, saying that it sings out the words from the hearts of the workers, and the more you sing, the more energetic you feel! They said well: "Once you read Chairman Mao's works, your mind becomes clear; once you sing songs praising Chairman Mao, your whole body becomes energetic!" Some workshops insist on singing this song before and after work. Everyone feels that after singing, their hearts are especially warm, and their revolutionary spirit is especially high. A young worker encountered difficulties while repairing equipment, but as soon as he thought of this song, he felt full of energy. He said, "With strength, you can't lift a thousand pounds, but with Mao Zedong Thought, a thousand-pound hammer can be used as a needle!"

The song "Chairman Mao's Works Shine with Golden Light" was performed at the 7th "Shanghai Spring" and was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is a great encouragement and motivation for us. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire factory launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and mass singing activities became even more vigorous. At the factory-wide singing festival, the workers sang revolutionary songs such as "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman" and "Chairman Mao's Works Shine with Golden Light," expressing their boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for the class enemies in the songs.

Comrade Wang Xiankun, a model worker, said excitedly, "In the old society, we were like cattle and horses, suffering from hunger and cold, how could we have the mood to sing? After liberation, we have the Party and Chairman Mao, and we workers can also sing on stage. I want to sing Chairman Mao's songs, sing revolutionary songs. The anti-Party clique does not allow us to sing, this is impossible! We must sing louder, making these demons tremble!"

Some bourgeois "authorities" spread the theory of "musical mysticism" and "technique supremacy," intimidating us workers and peasants, maliciously attacking mass revolutionary songs as "written quickly, sung quickly, forgotten quickly, discarded quickly," attempting to strike down revolutionary songs with one blow. This is just a dream! Our factory's revolutionary singing activities and the mass singing activities of the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers are a powerful response to them! With Mao Zedong Thought and the power of the masses, we can completely create a brand-new proletarian music that those bourgeois "authorities" cannot create!

### 唱毛主席的歌，浑身是劲！

    唱毛主席的歌，浑身是劲！
    去年年初的一个清晨，动力车间有一位老工人，捧着毛主席著作在黄浦江边细心阅读，吃早饭时间到了，还手不释卷。正在这时，一轮红日出东海，霞光万丈，光芒四射，一位青年工人看到这动人的景象，情不自禁地高声喊出：“东方升起了红太阳，毛主席著作闪金光！”
    这件事深深地激动了我们。我们厂的工人同志，通过社会主义教育运动，思想觉悟大大提高，组织了许多学习毛主席著作小组，出现了不少学习毛主席著作积极分子。毛主席著作中闪耀的思想光辉，激励着大家不断前进，真是越学越有劲，越学心越亮。对毛主席著作深厚的阶级感情，很自然地产生了歌颂党和毛主席，歌唱毛主席著作的强烈愿望。我们的业余作者非常想把职工如饥如渴地学习毛主席著作的情景用歌声唱出来。这时候，党组织又组织我们学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。学了毛主席著作，心里亮堂了，明确了为什么而写，产生了强烈的创作激情。我们就在这个基础上，写了《毛主席著作闪金光》这首歌曲的初稿。
    初稿写出来以后，大家觉得不论词或调，都远远没有表达出我们内心对党、对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。怎么加工提高呢？我们重温了毛主席“人民群众有无限的创造力”的教导，决定把初稿拿到车间里去，向工人请教。工人同志帮我们出了许多好主意。如原词中说“十船八船装不光……”，工人同志们说：“学习毛主席著作得到的宝，别说十船八船装不光，千船万船也装不光啊！”在创作过程中，只要谁说得对，我们就下手改，不受任何框框的束缚，一共修改了十几次。修改后的曲调，比原来更加热情奔放、激昂有力。
    工人们非常喜爱《毛主席著作闪金光》这首歌曲，说它唱出了工人心坎里的话，越唱越带劲！他们说得好：“一读毛主席著作，头脑就清醒，一唱歌颂毛主席的歌，全身就来劲！”有些车间坚持在班前班后唱这首歌，大家觉得唱了心里格外热呼，革命干劲格外高。有一位青年工人在检修设备时碰到了困难，但是一想起这首歌，浑身就来劲。他说：“靠力气举不起千斤，靠毛泽东思想千斤的铁锤当针拿！”
    《毛主席著作闪金光》这首歌曲在第七届“上海之春”演出以后，受到了广大工农兵群众的热烈欢迎，这对我们是极大的鼓舞和鞭策，在无产阶级文化大革命中，全厂掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，群众歌咏活动也更加蓬勃地开展起来，在全厂的歌咏大会上，工人群众高唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《毛主席著作闪金光》等革命歌曲，把全厂职工对党和毛主席的无比热爱和对阶级敌人的切齿仇恨，都写进了歌里，唱进了歌里。
    五好工人王贤昆激动地说：“旧社会做牛马，挨饿受冻，哪有心情唱歌。解放后翻身了，有了党和毛主席，我们工人也登台唱歌了。我要唱毛主席的歌，唱革命的歌，反党黑帮不准我们唱，这办不到！我们要唱得更响，唱得这些牛鬼蛇神发抖！”
    资产阶级的一些“权威”老爷们，宣扬什么“音乐神秘论”、“技巧至上论”，吓唬我们工农兵群众，恶毒地攻击群众革命歌曲是“写得快、唱得快、忘得快、丢得快”，妄图把革命歌曲一棍子打倒，这是梦想！我们厂的革命歌咏活动和广大工农兵的群众歌咏活动，就是对他们的有力回击！靠毛泽东思想，靠广大群众的力量，我们完全能创造出资产阶级“权威”们无法创造的崭新的无产阶级音乐！
