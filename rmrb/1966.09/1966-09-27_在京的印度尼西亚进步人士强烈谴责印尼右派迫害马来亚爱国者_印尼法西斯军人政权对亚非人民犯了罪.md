According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on September 24, Indonesian friends Ibrahim Isa and Supeno, as well as the chairman of the Indonesian Students Union in China, Rastono Daryanto, recently issued public letters and statements strongly condemning the illegal detention and brutal persecution of four members of the Malaysian National Liberation Front's delegation to Indonesia by the Indonesian fascist military regime. They also condemned the regime's attempt to hand them over to the "Malaysia" group led by Abdul Rahman.

Ibrahim Isa, Secretary-General of the Indonesian Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Organization and Secretary of the Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Organization's Indonesian branch, wrote in an open letter to the chairman of the Malaysian National Liberation Front's delegation to China, Sharma, on September 15, that the four persecuted Malaysian patriots are staunch warriors for Malaysian national independence. They have made tremendous contributions to strengthening the solidarity and fighting friendship between the Indonesian and Malaysian peoples.

The open letter exposed that "since October 1965, the right-wing military clique led by Nasution and Suharto has launched a campaign of terror nationwide against the Indonesian people, killing tens of thousands of patriots and democrats, imprisoning tens of thousands of people, subjecting them to the most barbaric torture, and treating them inhumanely. It is under the leadership of these two fascist generals, Nasution and Suharto, that a fascist military regime has been established in Indonesia. This fascist regime implements anti-people policies domestically and serves U.S. imperialism's interests abroad, thereby betraying the cause of independence and liberation for the peoples of Asia and Africa. They have changed their policy of opposing 'Malaysia' to one of colluding with the Rahman puppet clique, thus betraying the national independence struggles of the Malaysian and North Kalimantan peoples. While launching a racist anti-Chinese campaign domestically, to align with U.S. imperialism's policy of 'containing China,' the Nasution-Suharto fascist military clique has pursued a thoroughly anti-Chinese policy."

The open letter pointed out, "Their persecution of our four Malaysian brothers and sisters is another unforgivable crime committed by the Nasution-Suharto fascist military regime against the cause of liberation for the peoples of Asia and Africa." "The Indonesian Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Organization firmly demands the immediate release of the illegally detained members of the Malaysian National Liberation Front's delegation to Indonesia and allows them to go to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."

Supeno, representing Indonesian progressive journalists, issued a statement on September 20 saying, "The detention of these four warriors by the Indonesian fascist military regime is an illegal act aimed at completely destroying the solidarity between the Indonesian and Malaysian peoples who are fighting side by side against imperialism." "The barbaric treatment and fascist-style torture these four liberation warriors have endured during their detention have far exceeded the most basic principles of humanitarianism."

The statement expressed, "We, Indonesian progressive journalists, demand the immediate release of these four Malaysian warriors, the withdrawal of all malicious accusations against them, and immediate permission for them to go to a country of their free choice." The statement said, "The act of handing these four patriots over to the 'Malaysia' new colonialist puppet clique of Abdul Rahman will set a very dangerous precedent. It will not only be condemned by every upright person but will definitely face the strongest protests and opposition from all freedom-loving people around the world."

On September 16, Rastono Daryanto, chairman of the Indonesian Students Union in China, issued a statement on behalf of the organization protesting the crime of detaining Malaysian patriots by the Nasution-Suharto fascist military regime. The statement also expressed the highest respect for the four Malaysian patriots' brave struggle against the Nasution-Suharto fascist military regime. The union demanded the immediate release of these four patriots and allowed them to go to the country of their choice.

    在京的印度尼西亚进步人士强烈谴责印尼右派迫害马来亚爱国者
    印尼法西斯军人政权对亚非人民犯了罪
    据新华社二十四日讯  在北京的印度尼西亚朋友易卜拉欣·伊萨、苏佩诺和印度尼西亚在华学生联合会主席拉斯托诺·达尔央多最近分别发表公开信和声明，强烈谴责印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权非法拘留和残酷迫害马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团的四名成员，并妄图把他们交给“马来西亚”阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼集团的罪恶阴谋。
    印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织秘书长、亚非人民团结组织书记处印度尼西亚书记易卜拉欣·伊萨，在九月十五日致马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛的公开信中说，受迫害的四位马来亚爱国者是马来亚民族独立的坚强战士，他们对加强印度尼西亚和马来亚人民之间的团结和战斗友谊作出了巨大的贡献。
    公开信揭露说，“一九六五年十月以来，以纳苏蒂安—苏哈托为首的右派军事集团，在全国范围内对印度尼西亚人民发动了恐怖运动，成千上万的爱国志士和民主人士被屠杀，成千上万的人民被监禁，遭到了最野蛮的拷打，受到了非人道的待遇，也是以苏哈托和纳苏蒂安这两个法西斯将军为首的一个法西斯军人政权，在印度尼西亚建立起来了。这个法西斯政权在国内执行反人民的政策，而它的对外政策是为美帝国主义服务的，因而背叛了亚非人民独立和解放的事业。他们把对抗‘马来西亚’的政策改变成为勾结拉赫曼傀儡集团的政策，从而背叛了马来亚和北加里曼丹人民的民族独立斗争。他们在国内发动种族主义的反华运动的同时，为了符合美帝国主义‘遏制中国’的政策，纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军事集团追随一个彻头彻尾的反华政策。”
    公开信指出，“他们迫害我们四位马来亚兄弟姐妹的行为，是纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军人政权，对亚非人民解放事业所犯的另一个不可饶恕的罪行。”“印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织坚决要求，立即释放被非法逮捕的马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团的成员，允许他们去越南民主共和国。”
    苏佩诺代表印度尼西亚进步新闻工作者在九月二十日发表声明说，“印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权对这四名战士的拘留是一种非法的行为，旨在彻底破坏正在并肩进行反帝斗争的印度尼西亚和马来亚人民的团结。”“这四位解放战士在他们被拘留期间所受的野蛮待遇和法西斯式的虐待，已远远背离了最基本的人道主义准则。”
    声明表示，“我们印度尼西亚进步新闻工作者，要求尽速释放这四名马来亚战士，撤销对他们的一切恶毒的诬告，立即允许他们到一个由他们自由选择的国家去”。声明说，“把这四名爱国者交给‘马来西亚’的阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼新殖民主义傀儡集团的行为，将开创一个极其危险的先例，它不仅将受到每一个正直人士的谴责，而且一定会遭到世界所有爱好自由的人们的最强烈的抗议和反对。”
    印度尼西亚在华学生联合会主席拉斯托诺·达尔央多在九月十六日代表这个团体发表声明，抗议纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军人政权拘留马来亚爱国者的罪行。声明还对四位马来亚爱国者勇敢对抗纳苏蒂安—苏哈托法西斯军人政权的斗争精神，表示最崇高的敬意。这个联合会要求立即释放这四位爱国者，允许他们到他们所选择的国家去。
