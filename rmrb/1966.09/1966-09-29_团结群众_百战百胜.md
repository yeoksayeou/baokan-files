Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Red Guards have smashed the Four Olds and established the Four News. The people of the entire nation and the revolutionary people of the whole world are jubilant over this. All this shows that the Red Guards have done a good job!

Chairman Mao has always taught us that revolution relies on the masses, and "the people have boundless creative power." The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao point out: "Whether the Party's leadership dares to mobilize the masses will determine the fate of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." The great achievements made in the past few months have fully proven this.

I have a deep personal understanding of the importance of relying on the masses. During the years of the anti-Japanese guerrilla war, I worked in medical services in the New Fourth Army, following the troops as they fought across the Yangtze River. The enemy's fortresses were everywhere, and the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang reactionaries joined forces to launch ruthless "mopping-up" campaigns, brutally suppressing the revolution. However, by relying on the masses, we overcame countless difficulties and successfully completed our missions. In the liberation war that shocked the world, the situation was the same. A major battle often required the support of tens of thousands of civilian workers. They were all liberated peasants who, to support the revolutionary war, left their homes and, under the bombardment and blockade of enemy planes and artillery, risked their lives to transport wounded soldiers, supply provisions, and create conditions for us to provide timely medical treatment. Without the support of the masses, we would not have been able to take root there and complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party. Even now, when I think back to those days, my heart is still filled with emotion.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's correct line and policies for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, trust the masses, develop and strengthen the leftist forces, thoroughly isolate the most reactionary rightists, win over the middle elements, and gradually achieve unity with the majority, so as to deepen and carry out the movement thoroughly.

    团结群众  百战百胜
    全国人民代表大会代表前华东军区一级人民英雄  李蓝丁
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席领导下，红卫兵大破四旧，大立四新。全国人民和全世界革命人民，为此欢欣鼓舞。这一切，说明红卫兵小将们干得好！
    毛主席一贯地教导我们：革命要依靠群众，“人民群众有无限的创造力。”毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条指出：“党的领导敢不敢放手发动群众，将决定这场文化大革命的命运。”几个月来运动所取得的伟大成就，完全证明了这一点。
    对于依靠群众的重要性，我自己是有深切体会的。抗日游击战争年代，我在新四军做医疗工作，随部队转战长江南北。敌人碉堡林立，日伪军和国民党反动派同流合污，不断地发动残酷的清乡“扫荡”，猖狂地镇压革命。但是我们依靠群众，战胜了重重困难，胜利地完成了任务。在震惊中外的解放战争中，情形同样是这样。一次大的战役，往往需要几万名民工的支援。他们都是翻身农民，为了支援革命战争，远离家乡，在敌机敌炮的轰炸封锁下，冒着生命的危险，转运伤员，运送给养，为我们创造条件，及时地进行医疗救护工作。如果没有群众的支持，我们就不可能在那里生根，就不可能完成党交给我们的任务。现在我一想起当年的情景，心里还非常激动。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们必须坚决贯彻执行毛主席制定的无产阶级文化大革命的正确路线和政策，放手发动群众，依靠群众，信任群众，发展和壮大左派队伍，彻底孤立最反动的右派，争取中间派，逐步地做到团结大多数，把运动搞深搞透。
