Friends from various Asian and African countries continue to praise China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A Tanzanian friend who has visited China and personally witnessed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution recently told a Xinhua reporter in Dar es Salaam: "The current cultural revolution in China is a new contribution by Chairman Mao Zedong to the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism, because this cultural revolution is the greatest guarantee to prevent revisionists and other counter-revolutionaries from usurping power and harming the interests of the people."

He said, "I believe this great revolution will keep the Communist Party of China forever red."

He strongly condemned the attacks and slanders by revisionists and imperialists against China's Cultural Revolution. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionist clique dare not let the people carry out a proletarian cultural revolution, because such a revolution would sweep away the entire leadership of the Soviet revisionist CPSU.

He went on to say, "The ferocious imperialists are also frantically opposing this revolution because they have always hoped that the Communist Party of China would lay down its revolutionary red flag." He said: "The Red Guards have taken actions completely beyond their expectations. The imperialists are dreaming in broad daylight! The Red Guards have declared to the world that the East must remain red! The imperialists are naturally enraged."

Recently, the famous Congolese (Brazzaville) journalist Auguste Mpasi Muba told a Xinhua reporter, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China is inspiring the peoples of various countries who are struggling for complete independence and against imperialism and old and new colonialism."

He pointed out, "The powerful weapon of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is Mao Zedong Thought. The works and articles of Mao Zedong have always been the source of inspiration for the Chinese people."

He pointed out that the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards in various parts of China "make us, the oppressed people, even more admire the contributions of the People's Republic of China to the world revolutionary movement."

Recently, a member of the Somali General Union of Trade Unions delegation, Muhammad Mudey Muhammad, who visited China, told a Xinhua reporter in Mogadishu: "The purpose of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to eliminate bourgeois ideology in all fields, eradicate all bourgeois influences, and make Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in people's hearts."

He emphasized, "China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent!"

The dean of the Faculty of Education at Damascus University, Zadat Rikka, who participated in the Emergency Meeting of Asian and African Writers in Beijing, said on the 18th in Damascus: China's cultural revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. Of course, it touches the interests of imperialism. Therefore, they shamelessly oppose and slander this revolution.

He refuted the slanders by imperialism and its agents against China's Cultural Revolution, saying: "Some people say that the Chinese Cultural Revolution opposes religion and has destroyed mosques. This is not true. I recently visited a mosque in China. Some nuns were expelled from China because they engaged in illegal activities unrelated to religion."

    红卫兵向全世界宣告：东方将永远保持鲜红！
    亚非各国朋友热烈欢呼中国文化大革命
    新华社讯　亚非各国朋友继续纷纷赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命好得很。
    访问过中国并亲眼看到中国无产阶级文化大革命的一位坦桑尼亚朋友，最近在达累斯萨拉姆向本社记者说：“当前在中国展开的文化革命，是毛泽东主席对马克思列宁主义的理论和实践作出的崭新的贡献，因为这场文化大革命是防止修正主义者和其他反革命分子篡夺政权、损害人民群众利益的最大的保证。”
    他说，我相信，这场大革命将使中国共产党永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    他强烈谴责修正主义者和帝国主义者对中国文化大革命的攻击和诽谤。他指出，苏联修正主义集团根本不敢让人民进行无产阶级文化大革命，因为这样的革命会把“整个苏共修正主义领导冲得一干二净”。
    他接着说，“凶恶的帝国主义者也在疯狂地反对这场革命，因为他们一直希望，中国共产党会放下它的革命红旗。”他说：“红卫兵采取了完全出乎他们意料之外的行动。帝国主义者是白日作梦！红卫兵已向全世界宣告，东方必须保持红色！帝国主义者自然要暴跳如雷了。”
    刚果（布）著名新闻工作者奥古斯特·姆帕西·穆巴最近对新华社记者说，正在中国进行的无产阶级文化大革命“鼓舞着正在为争取完全独立、反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义统治而斗争的各国人民”。
    他指出：“这场无产阶级文化大革命的强大武器是毛泽东思想，毛泽东的著作和文章始终是鼓舞中国人民的源泉。”
    他指出，目前在中国各地的红卫兵的革命行动“使我们这些被压迫人民更加敬佩人民中国对全世界革命运动的贡献”。
    最近访问过中国的索马里劳工总联合会代表团团员穆罕默德·穆戴·穆罕默德在摩加迪沙对新华社记者说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的目的是为了在各个领域消灭资产阶级思想，根除一切资产阶级影响，使毛泽东思想更加深入人心。”
    他强调说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命好得很！”
    曾经在北京参加过亚非作家紧急会议的叙利亚大马士革大学教育学院院长扎达特·里卡比十八日在大马士革发表谈话说：中国的文化革命是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，当然，它触及帝国主义的利益。所以，他们肆无忌惮地反对和诬蔑这场革命。
    他驳斥帝国主义及其代理人对中国文化大革命的诬蔑说：“有些人说什么中国文化大革命反对宗教，捣毁了清真寺。这是不真实的，我最近在中国还去过清真寺。有些修女被赶出了中国，那是因为她们进行了同宗教无关的非法活动。”
