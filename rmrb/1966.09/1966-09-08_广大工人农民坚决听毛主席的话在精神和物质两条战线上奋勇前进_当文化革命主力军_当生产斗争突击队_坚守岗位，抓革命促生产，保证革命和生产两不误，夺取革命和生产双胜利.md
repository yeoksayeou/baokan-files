In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the vast numbers of workers, commune members, scientific and technical personnel, and other laborers across the country, who have displayed boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, have decided to take on the role of masters and firmly hold their production posts. They will continue to take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, better grasp revolution, promote production, and achieve victories in both the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production construction.

Reports from various places indicate that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted the ideological transformation of the people. The country is filled with a vibrant revolutionary atmosphere, and a new all-around leap is emerging. People in various places believe that as long as we continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp both the spiritual and material fronts, and with the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new high tide in socialist production construction will definitely emerge.

After studying the editorial "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" in the People's Daily, revolutionary workers in the capital have expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, act according to the Sixteen Points, grasp both revolution and production with one hand each, and achieve double victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. A production team leader from the Beijing Third Cotton Mill said, "We workers must be the main force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and also be the vanguards in production struggles. We must carry two burdens on our shoulders and be good workers for Chairman Mao." In the Dongsheng People's Commune of Beijing's suburbs, which has achieved grain increases for five consecutive years, the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Yonghong Production Team expressed their determination to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the team, boost revolutionary enthusiasm, harvest autumn crops well, plant winter wheat in a timely manner, and ensure that revolution and production do not clash.

Since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers in Shanghai's textile industry have fought brilliant battles on both the spiritual and material fronts. In July and August, textile workers overcame the rare prolonged high temperatures and difficulties with some raw cotton of poor quality, creating a great situation of increased production and stable quality. Many textile workers pointed out during the discussion of today's editorial in the People's Daily that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has provided a powerful impetus for production struggles and scientific experiments. We must weave more and better yarn and cloth for the people across the country. The wired broadcast network in Shanghai's suburbs today repeatedly broadcasted the editorial "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" from the People's Daily. Many cadres and commune members, while listening, unanimously expressed their determination to grasp revolution and promote production according to the spirit of this editorial, and achieve an all-around bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

Through their own practices, the broad masses of workers on various fronts such as industry, transportation, and basic construction in Shenyang have deeply felt that great Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive guiding the Chinese people to advance courageously on both the spiritual and material fronts. The broad masses of workers unanimously expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp revolution and promote production, and excellently complete the production tasks for the first year of China's third five-year plan.

According to the spirit of the Sixteen Points, various industrial leadership organs such as the Tianjin Municipal Industrial Bureaus and Industrial Companies have established two teams, one for grasping the Cultural Revolution and one for production. The workers of the Tianjin Third Steel Rolling Mill, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have exposed the capitalist-roaders in power and the ghosts and monsters hiding in the factory, with their revolutionary enthusiasm surging higher and higher. In the first eight months of this year, they have overfulfilled the steel production task, and the quality has also improved.

In many factories and enterprises in Guangzhou, the effect of grasping revolution and promoting production has been immediate. Since June, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers in the Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory has been increasing. In the hottest months of July and August, the nitrogen fertilizer production increased by more than onefold compared to May and June, and the quality was all first-grade products.

The broad revolutionary workers of the Harbin Wheel Factory are, on the one hand, further developing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and on the other hand, completing the production plan for August in terms of both quantity and quality. The workers of this factory said, "The capitalist-roaders in power are plotting to dig at the foundations of socialism, and we must expose and criticize them deeply, while redoubling our efforts to build socialism."

In Chairman Mao's hometown, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, the Xiangshan People's Commune held a special expanded meeting of the Party Committee today, based on the spirit of today's editorial in the People's Daily, to make specific arrangements for the current work. They are determined to achieve double victories in socialist revolution and production construction.

Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers across the country are preparing to go to the countryside in an organized manner to help with the autumn harvest and learn from poor and lower-middle peasants. In the southern regions where the autumn harvest comes early, some have already taken action. In recent days, Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers from many schools in Chengdu have gone to the suburban farms in an organized manner to help with the rice harvesting.

    据新华社七日讯　在文化大革命中焕发出冲天革命干劲的各地广大工人、公社社员、科学技术人员和其他劳动者，决心以主人翁的姿态坚守生产岗位，继续以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，更好地抓革命，促生产，夺取文化大革命和生产建设双胜利。

    首都广大革命职工学习了《人民日报》《抓革命，促生产》的社论以后，纷纷表示要听毛主席的话，按十六条办事，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，夺取文化大革命和生产的双丰收。北京第三棉纺厂的一位生产组长说，我们工人既要当文化大革命的主力军，也要在生产斗争中当闯将。我们要肩挑两副担子，当毛主席的好工人。在连续五年获得粮食增产的京郊东升人民公社永红生产队贫下中农表示，一定要在全队掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，鼓足革命干劲，收好秋季作物，适时种好小麦，保证革命和生产两不误。
    上海纺织工业的广大革命职工，从文化大革命开展以来，在精神战线和物质战线上都打了漂亮仗。七八两个月，纺织工人战胜了历年罕见的持续高温，克服了部分原棉质量较差的困难，创造了产量上升、质量稳定的大好局面。很多纺织工人在讨论今天《人民日报》社论的时候指出，文化大革命给生产斗争和科学实验提供了强大的动力。我们一定要为全国人民纺织出更多更好的纱布来。上海郊区的有线广播网今天一遍又一遍地播送了《人民日报》《抓革命，促生产》的社论。许多干部和社员，边听边议，一致表示要按照这篇社论的精神抓革命促生产，夺取今年农业生产的全面丰收。

    天津各工业局和工业公司等工业领导机关，根据十六条的精神，都成立了抓文化革命和生产的两个班子，一手抓革命，一手抓生产。天津市第三轧钢厂的工人们以毛泽东思想为武器，揪出了走资本主义道路的当权派和暗藏在工厂里的牛鬼蛇神，革命干劲越鼓越足，今年前八个月超额完成了钢材生产任务，质量也有所提高。
    在广州的许多工厂企业里，抓革命促生产起到了立竿见影的效果。广州氮肥厂从六月份开展文化大革命以来，职工的革命积极性越来越高，在天气最炎热的七、八月份，氮肥产量比五、六月份增长一倍多，质量全部达到一级品。
    哈尔滨车轮厂广大革命职工一方面正在把无产阶级文化大革命更加深入地开展起来，一方面按质按量地完成了八月份生产计划。这个厂的工人们说，走资本主义道路的当权派阴谋挖社会主义的墙脚，我们就要把他们揭深批臭，同时加倍地努力建设社会主义。
    在毛主席的家乡湖南省湘潭县韶山人民公社，公社党委今天专门召开了党委扩大会议，根据今天《人民日报》社论的精神，对当前工作作出了具体安排。他们决心夺取社会主义革命和生产建设的双胜利。
    各地红卫兵和革命师生，准备有组织地下乡帮助秋收，向贫农下中农学习。在秋收季节早的南方地区，有的已经行动起来。成都市许多大中学校的红卫兵和革命师生，这几天有组织地到市郊农村帮助抢收水稻。
