Comrade E.F. Hill, Chairman of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninists), and his wife, Joe Hill, were invited to attend an evening of arts and culture held in their honor today, where they watched the modern revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women."

Comrade Zhou Enlai, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Zhao Yiqing, an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, accompanied Comrade Hill and his wife to watch the performance.

After the performance, Comrade Hill and his wife went on stage with Comrade Zhou Enlai and others to shake hands with the performers. At this moment, the audience erupted in thunderous applause. The performers on stage and the audience in the hall together sang "The Sailors' Song" and shouted, "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"
