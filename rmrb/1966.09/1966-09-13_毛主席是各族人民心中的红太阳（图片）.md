The people of all nationalities in our country have boundless love for Chairman Mao and boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new and higher stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is marching towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the entire Party and the entire nation.

The people of all nationalities in our country enthusiastically sing praises: Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of all nationalities, the red sun in the hearts of all nationalities. Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon for all oppressed peoples in their struggle for liberation, the lifeline of all nationalities.

The people of all nationalities in our country hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward courageously, determined to pass down Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, forever and ever.

"Long live Chairman Mao!"

The people of all nationalities cheer and pay tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao.

	Never forgetting the Party and Chairman Mao after liberation. Farmers and herdsmen in the Shannan region of Tibet, during a celebration of the "Wangguo" festival, watched artistic performances praising our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

	The Li ethnic community members of the Dajie Production Brigade in Dazhong Commune, Baoting County, Hainan Island, love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought most dearly. Though they are not highly educated, they use methods like mutual teaching and collective listening to persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This is Hu Mu Fu, a 52-year-old poor peasant community member, speaking at a study session on Chairman Mao's works.

	Ma Xi Kui, an old revolutionary soldier from the Hui ethnic group in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, tells the youth about the history of revolutionary victories under Chairman Mao's leadership, encouraging them to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to become successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	The Mongolian youth of the Dalabutu Production Team in Baiyinbaoli Commune, Xiuzhu Muqin Banner, Inner Mongolia, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds. Their socialist consciousness has greatly improved, and they have achieved remarkable results in various positions. The picture shows the youth of the Dalabutu Production Team studying Chairman Mao's works together.

	Officials from the Zhuang, Yao, and Miao ethnic groups in Du'an Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi, with hearts full of boundless love for Chairman Mao, go to the Xinhua Bookstore to purchase Chairman Mao's works.
