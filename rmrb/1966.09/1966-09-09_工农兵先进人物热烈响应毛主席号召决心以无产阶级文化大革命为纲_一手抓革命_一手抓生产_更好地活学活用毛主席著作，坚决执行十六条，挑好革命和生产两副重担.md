Various advanced workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country have issued statements or written articles, expressing their high sense of revolutionary responsibility. They say, "We workers, peasants, and soldiers will not let down Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's expectations. We will definitely shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and construction, promote production through revolution, and launch a new high tide in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist production and construction, building our great motherland even more prosperous and strong."

The famous "Iron Man" of Daqing Oilfield, Wang Jinxi, wrote the following lines to express the revolutionary spirit of the working class when he spoke to a reporter today: "The oil workers are highly conscious, defending the Party's good leadership; cutting off the claws of the anti-Party demons, launching a new production high tide." He said, "We oil workers will definitely implement the Sixteen Points, take the lead in this great struggle, play the role of the main force, expose all the ghosts and monsters, fight them thoroughly, and criticize them deeply. At the same time, we will definitely do a good job in production and produce more oil for the country." Wang Jinxi said, "During the Cultural Revolution, the workers of Daqing Oilfield have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, further promoting their own ideological transformation. We have turned our boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao and our deep hatred for the anti-Party, anti-socialist gang of four into boundless strength, fighting the production battle as a political battle, and pushing the Cultural Revolution and production construction to a new high tide."

In Shanghai, which has a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition, Huang Guisheng, an old worker from Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Mill who fought alongside martyr Gu Zhenghong more than forty years ago and still has bullet wounds on his body, said, "In the past, facing the big knives, machine guns, and armored cars of imperialism, warlords, bureaucrats, and the Kuomintang reactionaries, we were fearless and dared to fight. Today, the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is a major event concerning the destiny and future of our country, a struggle to defend the people's mountains and rivers. We workers must stand at the forefront of the struggle and vow to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end."

Huang Rongchang, a deputy chief engineer from Chongqing Steel Company who started as a carpenter, said that in the current good revolutionary situation, he will study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points more seriously, ensuring a double harvest in the Cultural Revolution and production construction.

Chen Yonggui, the Party branch secretary of Dazhai Brigade, said, "The Party Central Committee's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution points out that we workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of this Cultural Revolution. This is the greatest trust and encouragement from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. All the members of Dazhai Brigade will definitely not let down the Party and Chairman Mao's expectations and will definitely be the main force of the Cultural Revolution and the shock troops of production construction."

Chen Yonggui said, "In the face of class struggle, Dazhai Brigade remains unshakable and unyielding, standing tall and firm in the struggle; in production struggle, we fear neither hardship nor fatigue, transforming mountains and valleys, changing heaven and earth; in scientific experiments, we dare to think and dare to do, daring to tread paths where no one has gone before. What do we rely on? In one word, it is the great thought of Mao Zedong. We will definitely forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, grasp revolution and promote production, striving to achieve the greatest results."

National agricultural labor model Gong Changsu enthusiastically talked about the current good situation of the Cultural Revolution and agricultural production. He said, "The autumn crops in Wugong Commune of Hebei Province are generally growing well. Poor and lower-middle peasants have expressed that they will definitely let Mao Zedong Thought take root in their minds, not only fighting the spiritual battle but also the material battle, definitely harvesting the fruits of abundance, and achieving double victories in revolution and production."

Xiao Xingli, a national agricultural labor model and Party committee secretary of Wangcheng Commune in Hubei Province's Xianning County, said, "The two burdens of the Cultural Revolution and production construction, we poor and lower-middle peasants can definitely shoulder, can definitely carry, and can definitely carry well. This is because we have the red sun in our hearts, the steering wheel, and the locomotive, which is Mao Zedong Thought."

The commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, while actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are also highly vigilant, guarding their posts, and strengthening their preparedness. Zhang Yingcai, a famous national hero and division commander of the Kunming troops, said, "With the invincible thought of Mao Zedong as our weapon, we not only have the confidence and strength to defeat all armed enemies but also the confidence and strength to defeat all unarmed enemies."

    工农兵先进人物热烈响应毛主席号召决心以无产阶级文化大革命为纲
    一手抓革命  一手抓生产
    更好地活学活用毛主席著作，坚决执行十六条，挑好革命和生产两副重担
    据新华社八日讯　各地工农兵先进人物纷纷发表谈话或发表文章，怀着高度的革命责任感表示，我们工农兵决不辜负毛主席和党中央的殷切期望，一定要挑起革命和建设的两副重担，抓革命促生产，掀起无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义生产建设的新高潮，把我们的伟大祖国建设得更加繁荣富强。
    “石油工人觉悟高，保卫党的好领导；斩断反党毒魔爪，掀起生产新高潮。”著名的大庆油田“铁人”王进喜今天对记者发表谈话时，写下了这样的表达工人阶级革命豪情的诗句。他说：我们石油工人一定要坚决执行十六条，在这场伟大的斗争中冲锋陷阵，起主力军的作用，把一切牛鬼蛇神揪出来，斗臭斗垮，批深批透。同时，我们也一定要把生产搞好，为国家生产出更多的石油。王进喜说：在文化大革命中，我们大庆油田的工人们活学活用毛主席著作，进一步促进了自己的思想革命化。我们把对党和毛主席的无限热爱，把对反党反社会主义黑帮的无比仇恨，化成了无穷无尽的力量，把生产仗当成政治仗打，把文化大革命和生产建设推向一个新的高潮。
    在具有光荣革命斗争传统的上海，四十多年前曾经同顾正红烈士并肩战斗过、至今身上还留着子弹伤痕的上海国棉二厂老工人黄桂生说：过去，面对着帝国主义、军阀官僚和国民党反动派的大刀、机枪、装甲车，我们无所畏惧，敢打敢冲。今天，毛主席亲自领导的文化大革命，是关系到我们国家命运和前途的大事，是一场保卫人民江山的斗争。我们工人更要站在斗争的最前线，誓将文化大革命进行到底。
    重庆钢铁公司木工出身的副总工程师黄荣昌说，在当前的大好革命形势下，他要更加认真地活学活用毛主席著作，活学活用十六条，保证文化大革命和生产建设双丰收。
    大寨大队的党支部书记陈永贵说，党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定中指出，我们工农兵是这场文化大革命的主力军，这是党中央和毛主席对我们的最大信任和最大鼓舞。我们大寨大队的全体社员，一定不辜负党和毛主席对我们的殷切期望，一定要当好文化大革命的主力军和生产建设上的突击队。
    陈永贵说：我们大寨大队在阶级斗争的大风大浪中不动摇，不转向，挺起腰杆，坚持斗争；在生产斗争中不怕苦不怕累，治山治沟，改天换地；在科学实验中敢想敢干，敢于走前人没走过的路。我们靠的是什么呢？一句话，靠的是伟大的毛泽东思想。我们一定要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，抓革命促生产，努力作出最大的成绩。
    全国农业劳动模范耿长锁兴奋地谈到了当前文化大革命和农业生产的大好形势。他说，我们河北省五公公社五公大队的秋收作物普遍生长良好。贫农下中农们表示，一定要让毛泽东思想在脑子里扎根，不光要打好精神仗，还要打好物质仗，一定要把丰收的果实拿到手，做到革命生产双胜利。
    湖北省的全国农业劳动模范、湖北省浠水县望城公社党委书记饶兴礼说：文化大革命和生产建设这两副担子，我们贫下中农一定能够挑得起，挑得动，挑得好。这是因为我们心中有了红太阳，有了方向盘，有了火车头，这就是毛泽东思想。
    中国人民解放军的指挥员、战斗员们，在积极参加无产阶级文化大革命的同时，百倍地提高警惕，严守岗位，加强战备。全国著名的战斗英雄、昆明部队某师师长张英才说，我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，不但有信心、有力量打败一切拿枪的敌人，而且有信心、有力量打败一切不拿枪的敌人。
