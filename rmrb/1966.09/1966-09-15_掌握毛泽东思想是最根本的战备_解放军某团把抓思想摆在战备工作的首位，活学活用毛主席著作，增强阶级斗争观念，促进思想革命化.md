A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army places emphasis on ideological work in war preparedness, actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works, strengthens the consciousness of class struggle, and promotes ideological revolutionization.

Xinhua News Agency, September 14th - According to a report from the *Liberation Army Daily*: The People's Liberation Army's certain unit uses Mao Zedong Thought as a guideline for war preparedness education. They have deeply instilled in the soldiers and officers a hatred for American imperialism, always ready to defend the motherland, liberate Taiwan, and support the Vietnamese people's struggle against America.

Since Vice Chairman Lin Biao proposed emphasizing politics, and through the struggle to implement the spirit of the entire army's political work conference this year, the leaders of this unit have deeply realized that in war preparedness, the question of what to prioritize is an important aspect of the struggle between two lines of military building and two kinds of military thought. In the matter of war preparedness, only when ideological preparation is solidified can material preparation be solidified. Therefore, this year, in emphasizing war preparedness, they first emphasized ideology, emphasizing the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works, truly placing ideological work at the forefront of war preparedness. Because of the fundamental strengthening of war preparedness consciousness, the morale of the troops is high, their fighting spirit is soaring, their military training results are solid, and their material preparations are more solidified.

In emphasizing war preparedness ideology, this unit focused on five aspects: (1) Establishing the viewpoint of class struggle, recognizing the aggressive nature of American imperialism, and being prepared for war at all times; (2) Establishing the thoughts of patriotism and proletarian internationalism, being both a domestic revolutionary and an international revolutionary; (3) Establishing the thought of people's war; (4) Establishing the thought of revolutionary heroism; (5) Establishing a high sense of policy and discipline. They felt that in emphasizing war preparedness ideology, it is not enough to just talk about the situation; more importantly, using Mao Zedong Thought as a guideline, they must vigorously promote the ideological revolutionization of people. As some comrades have said, "War preparedness enthusiasm is revolutionary enthusiasm. It does not depend on whether the situation is tense or not at a given time, but on whether it is revolutionary or not."

War preparedness education is an important aspect of learning Mao Zedong Thought. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental and decisive factor in war preparedness. This unit deeply felt in practice that learning Chairman Mao's works with the situation and tasks in mind, and with ideological issues in mind, is the main content and main method of war preparedness education. In the past, some officers and soldiers had the thought of peace complacency. The leadership would sound the alarm and conduct emergency assemblies, but the problem was never really solved. Later, by deeply studying Chairman Mao's statements about the nature of imperialism, linking it to the situation and history, everyone came to realize that the aggressive nature of American imperialism would never change, thus laying a solid foundation for the thought of being ever-ready. Some soldiers lacked a correct understanding of the issue of life and death. They organized the study of "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "In Service of the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and conducted education from the fundamental issue of worldview. The problem was then solved more thoroughly. Through their studies, the soldiers expressed their determination to "live for the revolution and die for the revolution." Comrades said, "No matter how many times you prepare for war, the most fundamental war preparedness is mastering Mao Zedong Thought."

In concentrated war preparedness education and regular war preparedness education, this unit uses Chairman Mao's works as textbooks, adopting the method of "annihilation battles," learning one viewpoint at a time, and solving one problem at a time. They include the content related to war preparedness from Chairman Mao's works in their daily reading plan. Within a certain period, they conduct small rectification movements targeting active thoughts on war preparedness. Each company also holds thematic sharing meetings, where everyone shares their insights, with good effects. In addition, they use slogan boards, blackboards, wall newspapers, and artistic activities in various forms to complement war preparedness education.

Class education is the foundation of war preparedness education. This unit frequently conducts class education through recalling bitterness, visiting poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas, reading class education books, discussing films and dramas that reflect class struggle, and holding picture exhibitions. Among these, recalling class bitterness, speaking of national hatred, and denouncing the crimes of American imperialism are the main methods of conducting class education. In these educations, they organize officers and soldiers to seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant statements.

They also frequently tell the troops about the new crimes committed by American imperialism around the world, especially their aggressive crimes in Vietnam and their war provocations against our country, linking old grudges with new ones, continuously deepening the troops' class hatred towards American imperialism. The soldiers say, "American imperialism and reactionaries of various countries are a den of wolves," "American imperialism is the backbone and leader of all reactionaries in the world. If we do not eliminate this arch-enemy, American imperialism, we will not rest in peace!"

In recalling bitterness, they inspire everyone to realize that "all the suffering people in the world are bitter gourds on the same vine," clearly establishing the thought of serving the people of the world and fighting for world revolution. Officers and soldiers express: For the liberation of class brothers suffering in the world, even if it means climbing mountains of knives and seas of fire, being crushed to pieces, they are willing.

    掌握毛泽东思想是最根本的战备
    解放军某团把抓思想摆在战备工作的首位，活学活用毛主席著作，增强阶级斗争观念，促进思想革命化
    新华社十四日讯　据《解放军报》报道：人民解放军某团以毛泽东思想为指针进行战备教育，把指战员对美帝国主义的仇恨搞得深深的，随时准备为保卫祖国、解放台湾，为支援越南人民抗美斗争打头阵、当尖刀。
    从林彪副主席提出突出政治以来，到今年贯彻全军政工会议精神、狠抓突出政治落实的斗争实践中，这个团的领导同志深刻认识到：战备工作中首要抓什么的问题，实质上是两条建军路线、两种建军思想斗争的一个重要方面。在战备问题上，只有思想准备落实，物质准备才能落实。因此，今年抓战备，他们首先抓思想，抓活学活用毛主席著作，真正把抓思想摆在战备工作的首位。由于从根本上加强了战备观念，部队士气高涨，斗志昂扬，军事训练成绩扎实，物质准备也更加落实。
    抓战备思想，这个团着重抓了五个方面的问题：（一）确立阶级斗争观点，认清美帝国主义的侵略本质，一切立足于准备打仗；（二）确立爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义思想，既当国内革命派，又当国际革命派；（三）确立人民战争思想；（四）确立革命英雄主义思想；
  （五）确立高度的政策纪律观念。他们体会到：抓战备思想，不仅要讲形势，更重要的是以毛泽东思想为指针，狠抓人的思想革命化。正像有的同志说的那样：“战备积极性，就是革命积极性。它不取决于一时的形势紧张不紧张，而取决于革命不革命。”
    战备教育是学习毛泽东思想的一个重要方面，掌握毛泽东思想是最根本、最有决定意义的战备。这个团在实践中深深体会到，带着形势任务、带着思想问题学习毛主席著作，是战备教育的主要内容和主要方法。过去有些干部战士存在和平麻痹思想，领导上就拉警报，搞紧急集合，结果一直解决不了。后来深入学习毛主席有关帝国主义本性的论述，联系形势，联系历史，使大家认识到美帝国主义的侵略本性永远不会改变，就给常备不懈思想打下了牢靠的基础。有些战士对生死问题缺乏正确的认识，他们组织学习《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》，从世界观这个根本问题上进行教育，问题就解决得比较深透。战士们通过学习，表示决心要“为革命而生、为革命而死”。同志们说：“千战备，万战备，掌握毛泽东思想是最根本的战备。”
    这个团在集中的战备教育和经常的战备教育中，以毛主席著作为教材，采取打“歼灭战”的办法，一个观点一个观点地学，一个问题一个问题地解决。他们把毛主席著作中与战备有关的内容列入天天读的计划。在一定的时间内，针对战备活思想进行小整风。各连还召开专题讲用会，大家谈体会，效果很好。此外，还运用语录板、黑板报、墙报和文艺活动等多种形式配合战备教育。
    阶级教育是战备教育的基础。这个团经常通过忆苦，到农村访问贫下中农，阅读阶级教育图书，座谈反映阶级斗争的电影、戏剧和举办图片资料展览等各种活动，进行阶级教育。其中，忆阶级苦、讲民族恨、控诉美帝罪行，是进行阶级教育的主要方法。在这些教育中，都组织干部战士认真学习毛主席的有关论述。
    他们还经常把美帝国主义在世界上犯下的新罪行，特别是在越南的侵略罪行和对我国的战争挑衅，讲给部队听，把旧恨新仇联结起来，不断加深部队对美帝国主义的阶级仇恨。战士们说，“美帝国主义和各国反动派是一个窝里的豺狼”，“美帝国主义是全世界一切反动派的靠山和头子。不消灭美帝国主义这个死对头，死不瞑目！”
    在忆苦中，他们启发大家认识到“全世界受苦受难的人民都是一根藤上的苦瓜”，明确树立为世界人民服务、为世界革命打仗的思想。干部战士们表示：为了解放世界上受苦受难的阶级兄弟，就是上刀山，入火海，粉身碎骨也心甘情愿。
