U.S. aircraft brazenly sank and damaged two of our small cargo ships, killing nine crew members and injuring seven.

Our Ministry of National Defense lodges the strongest protest against the U.S. imperialists' war provocation.

Relevant authorities in our country strongly condemn the recent acts of aggression by U.S. invaders who dispatched aircraft to repeatedly attack our ships.

	New China News Agency, September 5th—In the early hours of August 29th, U.S. imperialist military aircraft brazenly attacked our small cargo ships sailing on normal routes in the Gulf of Tonkin, sinking and damaging one ship each. Nine of our crew members were killed and seven were injured. This is another bloody debt owed by U.S. imperialism to the Chinese people and a serious incident of blatant war provocation against our country while it expands its aggression in Vietnam. The Chinese people are extremely indignant at this bloody crime by U.S. imperialism. The spokesperson of our Ministry of National Defense strongly protests this!

	At 1:30 AM on August 29th, our small cargo ships No. 1018 and No. 1019, flying the national flag of our country, were sailing on normal routes in the western part of the Gulf of Tonkin. They were suddenly attacked by U.S. military aircraft, which bombed and strafed them continuously for three hours. It has been confirmed that ship No. 1018 was sunk and ship No. 1019 was damaged. Nine of our crew members were killed and seven were injured.

	The spokesperson of our Ministry of National Defense emphasized that the U.S. imperialists' brazen sinking and damaging of our small cargo ships is not an isolated incident. It is another serious step in the U.S. imperialists' mad war provocation against our country. While the U.S. imperialists are bombing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and further expanding their bombing of North Vietnam, they have, despite repeated warnings from our government and people, repeatedly threatened, provoked, and bombed and strafed our fishing boats and merchant ships, causing heavy losses to the lives and property of our people. We once again solemnly warn the U.S. aggressors that blood debts must be repaid in blood. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never allow U.S. imperialism to run amok. We have already made it clear that we keep our word. If the U.S. imperialists dare to impose war on us, we will smash their spines without mercy and completely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate them.

	New China News Agency, September 5th—In recent periods, U.S. imperialist military aircraft have repeatedly attacked our merchant ships and fishing boats on the high seas, disrupting our maritime transportation and fishing production.

	On July 30th, two U.S. aircraft in the northern part of the Gulf of Tonkin's high seas performed low-altitude dives on our "Nanhai 155" merchant ship, which was sailing. Later, seven more U.S. aircraft flew over our merchant ship, circling and diving, harassing our ship for two hours and five minutes. On August 6th, fifteen fishing boats from Haikang County, Guangdong Province, were operating in the high seas west of Weizhou Island. A batch of three U.S. aircraft dove and bombed our fishing boats, dropping three bombs that did not hit. On August 12th, our "Nanhai 174" merchant ship was sailing in the high seas south of Mong Cai when two U.S. aircraft circled our ship six times before leaving.

	Our relevant authorities strongly protest the continuous attacks by U.S. air pirates on our merchant ships and fishing boats and solemnly warn the U.S. aggressors that the seven hundred million Chinese people are not to be trifled with. U.S. military aircraft must immediately stop this shameless provocation. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this will be the responsibility of the U.S. government.

    美机悍然炸沉炸伤我小型货船各一艘打死打伤船员十六人
    我国防部最强烈抗议美帝战争挑衅
    我有关方面严厉谴责美国侵略者最近派遣飞机多次袭击我船只的罪行
    新华社五日讯　八月二十九日凌晨，美帝国主义军用飞机，悍然向正在北部湾正常航线上行驶的我国小型货船发起攻击，炸沉炸伤各一艘，打死我船员九人，打伤七人。这是美帝国主义对中国人民欠下的又一笔血债，是它在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，又一次明目张胆地对我国进行战争挑衅的严重事件。中国人民对美帝国主义这一血腥罪行表示无比愤慨，我国防部发言人就此提出最强烈的抗议！
    八月二十九日一时三十分，我小型货船一零一八号、一零一九号，悬挂着我国国旗，在北部湾西部正常航线上航行，突然遭美国军用飞机连续轰炸扫射，达三小时之久。现已查明，我一零一八号船被炸沉，一零一九号船被炸伤。我船员九人被打死，七人受伤。
    我国防部发言人强调指出，美帝国主义悍然炸沉炸伤我国小型货船，绝不是一次孤立的事件。这是美帝国主义疯狂对我国进行战争挑衅的又一严重步骤。美帝国主义在轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内，并进一步扩大对越南北方轰炸的同时，不顾我国政府和我国人民的多次警告，竟然一而再，再而三地对我国渔船、商船进行威胁挑衅和轰炸扫射，使我国人民生命财产遭受重大损失。我们再次严重警告美国侵略者，血债必须用血来还。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，决不能听任美帝国主义胡作非为。我们早就把话说在前面了，我们说了话是算数的。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，那我们就毫不留情地砸断美国侵略者的脊骨，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它们消灭掉。
    新华社五日讯　最近一个时期，美帝国主义军用飞机在公海上多次袭击我国商船和渔船，破坏我海上运输和渔业生产。
    七月三十日，美机两架在北部湾北部公海上，对我国正在航行的“南海一五五号”商船，进行低空俯冲，后又有美机七架，飞临我商船上空盘旋和俯冲，与我船纠缠两小时零五分。八月六日，我广东省海康县十五艘渔船在白龙尾岛以西公海作业，美机一批三架对我渔船俯冲轰炸，投弹三枚未中。八月十二日，我“南海一七四号”商船在芒街以南公海上航行时，美机两架在我船上空盘旋六次以后离去。
    我有关方面对于美国空中强盗连续不断袭击我国商船和渔船，表示强烈抗议，并严正警告美国侵略者，七亿中国人民是不好惹的，美国军用飞机必须立即停止这种无耻的挑衅。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，概由美国政府负责。
