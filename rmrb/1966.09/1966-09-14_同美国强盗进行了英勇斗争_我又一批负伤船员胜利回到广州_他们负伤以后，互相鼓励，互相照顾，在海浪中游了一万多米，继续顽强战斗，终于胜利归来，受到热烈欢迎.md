In the face of an attack by American imperialist military aircraft, part of the crew of our small cargo ship No. 1018, who were injured, returned to Guangzhou by plane on the 12th. When they stepped off the plane with the assistance and care of medical personnel, they were warmly welcomed by over 500 people, including Guangdong Province Vice Governor and Guangzhou Mayor Zeng Sheng, Guangdong Province Vice Governor Zhao Zhuoyun, Deputy Minister of Communications Yu Mei, and relevant department heads, maritime workers, and Red Guards from Guangdong Province.

Zeng Sheng and others warmly embraced the injured sailors. The 14 sailors from the two ships that returned to Guangzhou on the 7th also came to the airport to welcome them. They were particularly excited to see their comrades who had fought bravely alongside them. The captain of cargo ship No. 1018, Huang Bu San, who was seriously injured, had already returned to Guangzhou by plane on the 11th.

On August 29th, when American imperialist military aircraft attacked this cargo ship, they bravely fought against the enemy until their ship was destroyed and sank. Under the dense cannon fire from the enemy aircraft, each of them, injured, encouraged and supported each other in the turbulent sea waves, swimming over ten thousand meters to an uninhabited island. On the island, they continued to suffer from enemy aircraft searches and bombings. Enduring the pain of their wounds and hunger, they relied on wild vegetables and fruits to survive, displaying an indomitable fighting spirit, undaunted, and persevering day after day. Finally, with the help of nearby people, they escaped and returned victorious. The batch of injured sailors who returned to Guangzhou have been immediately sent to the hospital for further treatment.

    同美国强盗进行了英勇斗争
    我又一批负伤船员胜利回到广州
    他们负伤以后，互相鼓励，互相照顾，在海浪中游了一万多米，继续顽强战斗，终于胜利归来，受到热烈欢迎
    新华社广州十三日电　在遭到美帝国主义军用飞机攻击时负伤的我国小型货船一零一八号的部分船员，十二日乘飞机回到广州。当他们在护理人员扶持和照顾下走下飞机时，受到了广东省副省长、广州市市长曾生，广东省副省长赵卓云、交通部副部长于眉，以及广东省航运职工、各有关部门负责人和红卫兵等五百多人的热烈欢迎。曾生等同负伤的船员们亲切拥抱。七日回到广州的这两艘船的十四名船员也到机场迎接。他们同曾和自己一起英勇斗争的战友们见面的时候，显得分外兴奋。身负重伤的一零一八号货船的船长黄不三，已在十一日乘飞机回到广州。
    八月二十九日当美帝国主义军用飞机向这艘货船发起攻击时，他们英勇地和敌人斗争，一直坚持到他们船被敌机炸毁下沉才离船。在美国空中强盗密集的炮火扫射下，他们每个人带着伤，在汹涌的海浪中互相鼓励、互相照顾，游到一万多米外一个没有人烟的荒岛上。在荒岛上他们又继续遭到敌机的搜索扫射，他们忍受着伤口的疼痛和饥饿，靠岛上的野菜野果充饥，发挥英勇顽强的战斗精神，毫不气馁，坚持了一天又一天。最后在附近人民的援救下脱险，胜利归来。回到广州的这批受伤船员，已立即被送到医院继续治疗。
