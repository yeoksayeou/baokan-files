Workers in some factories in Guangdong and Sichuan, filled with boundless admiration and love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have creatively used sugarcane waste to produce embossed paper for printing Chairman Mao's works.

In recent years, a new wave of studying Chairman Mao's works has swept the nation. The broad masses of revolutionary people urgently need Chairman Mao's books, and embossed paper is a good type of paper for printing Chairman Mao's works. To this end, workers from the Zhujiang Paper Mill in Guangdong, Shunde Sugar Mill, and Neijiang Sugar Mill in Sichuan bravely took on the honorable task of trial production. After repeated experiments, they finally succeeded and have already started mass production.

    广东四川用蔗渣制成凸版纸
    广东和四川一些工厂的职工怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限敬仰和无比热爱，创造性地用蔗渣制成了印刷毛主席著作的凸版印刷纸。
    近年来，全国掀起大学毛主席著作的群众性新高潮，广大革命群众迫切需要毛主席的书，而凸版纸又是印刷毛主席著作的较好纸张。为此，广东珠江造纸厂、顺德糖厂和四川内江糖厂的职工们，勇敢地接受了这一光荣的试制任务。经过反复多次的试验，终于获得成功，并且已经成批投入生产。
