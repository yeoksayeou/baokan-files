	Warm congratulations on the successful conclusion of the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational. Vice Premier He Long hosted a banquet to entertain friends from various countries.

	Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: Vice Premier He Long held a banquet this evening to entertain friends from various countries who participated in this Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational.

	Vice Premier He Long spoke at the banquet, representing the Chinese government and people, warmly congratulating the successful conclusion of this invitational tournament.

	Vice Premier He Long said: This invitational tournament was filled with a friendly atmosphere and brimming with anti-imperialist spirit. It fully reflected the common will of the Asian peoples to unite, to be independent, and to carry the anti-imperialist revolution through to the end. Through friendly competitions, joint training, and experience-sharing sessions, athletes from various countries have strengthened their friendships and mutual understanding, improved their athletic skills, and made positive contributions to the anti-imperialist cause and the development of world table tennis. These facts show that the spirit of "promoting friendship, mutual advancement, common development, and united anti-imperialism" is in line with the common interests of the peoples of all countries.

	Vice Premier He Long said: Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Now, the country is full of revolutionary fervor, and a new comprehensive leap is emerging. The Chinese people have experienced that as long as we act according to Mao Zedong Thought, our revolutionary and construction work will be invincible. On the contrary, if we deviate from the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, our cause will suffer setbacks and failures. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the Chinese people, the red sun in our hearts. The Chinese people have limitless love, faith, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao.

	Vice Premier He Long pointed out, under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao, a great cultural revolution is now vigorously unfolding in our country. This cultural revolution is a great innovation in the communist movement, a great innovation in the socialist revolution, and a new, deeper, and broader stage in the development of our socialist revolution. The purpose of this cultural revolution is to eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, transform people's souls, achieve the ideological revolution of the people, uproot the roots of revisionism, and consolidate and develop the socialist system. Let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions and use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the entire society.

	Vice Premier He Long said: Currently, the struggle of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world against imperialism led by the United States, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionism is in a great situation. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries, especially the revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are flourishing. The overall trend of imperialism heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism heading towards global victory is unchangeable.

	Vice Premier He Long finally expressed: "The Chinese people strongly condemn the crimes of U.S. imperialism in expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and most enthusiastically and resolutely support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call. The Chinese people strongly condemn the Soviet revisionist leadership's policy of fake support and real betrayal in the issue of Vietnam's struggle against the U.S. The Chinese people will not hesitate to pay any price and take any risk to firmly support the Vietnamese people until they achieve the final victory in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation."

	The entire banquet was filled with a warm atmosphere of combative unity and friendship. Friends from various countries frequently raised their glasses to toast each other, warmly congratulating the new victories achieved by athletes from Asian countries in this competition and warmly congratulating the further development of the combative friendship of unity and anti-imperialism between athletes and peoples of Asian countries.

	Those who attended the banquet this evening to accompany were: Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Xiao, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Committee Song Yiping, Deputy Director of the State Sports Commission Rong Gaotang, Huang Zhong, Li Menghua, and Zhao Zhengong.

	Diplomatic envoys from various relevant countries to China, as well as the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Beijing office, Jalal, and the Japanese peace activist Nishisonji Koichi in Beijing, were invited to attend the banquet.
