Editor's Note: The glorious national holiday of the Chinese people— the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China—is approaching! We are filled with boundless excitement as we welcome this holiday!

This year's National Day comes at a time when the entire nation is further launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping the nation. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great victories. The country is filled with a revolutionary fervor, and a new, comprehensive leap forward is emerging. We enthusiastically hail the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work. Mao Zedong Thought can change people's spiritual outlook and can change the face of our motherland. The great victories of the Chinese revolution and all the brilliant achievements of our socialist revolution and socialist construction over the past 17 years of liberation are all derived from the great Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is not only a beacon for the Chinese people but also a beacon for the revolutionary people of the world.

Let us advance triumphantly under the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought, riding the winds and breaking the waves!

Father and Mother Are Dear, But Chairman Mao Is Dearer; Ten Thousand Good Things, Chairman Mao's Works Are the Best—Hutang Brigade Farmers' Spirit Transformed Through Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works

Chairman Mao is the brightest sun in our hearts. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, it will become an inexhaustible force. The peasants of Hutang Brigade in Shuangfu Public Commune, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, have insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In just one year, people's spiritual outlook has undergone profound and tremendous changes.

Listen to Chairman Mao's Words and Walk the Socialist Path

In recent years, the broad masses of peasants in this brigade, through recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, have come to love Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought even more. The entire brigade has launched a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works. Now, the entire brigade has a communist night school, every household has a portrait of Chairman Mao, everywhere has quotations from Chairman Mao, many households have Chairman Mao's works, and many people have written their study notes.

The peasants of Hutang love Chairman Mao dearly and regard Chairman Mao's books as treasures for rebellion and revolution. They say: "Father and mother are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer; ten thousand good things, Chairman Mao's works are the best. 'One can go a day without eating, but one cannot go a day without reading Chairman Mao's books, or one's thoughts will fall behind.'" Li Xiangxian, a five-guarantee household in Xintan Production Team, is 75 years old. Every time there is a collective study session, he goes to participate with a cane. He says: "In the old society, who cared for an old person like me? Today's happiness is all due to Chairman Mao's kindness. Chairman Mao's words are all spoken from our hearts. As long as I live, I will study Chairman Mao's books every day." Xiao Yuanzhen, a poor peasant woman in Yongfeng Production Team, has never been to school and often asks her children to read Chairman Mao's books to her. She never misses a collective study session. The peasants of Hutang are eager to read Chairman Mao's books. The propaganda committee of the brigade party branch says: "We poor and lower-middle peasants do not study Chairman Mao's books, how can we make a revolution? Listening to Chairman Mao's words and walking the socialist path, our feet are strong; carrying the revolutionary burden, our shoulders are strong. Chairman Mao's teachings make our whole body strong."

Devoted to the Collective

The peasants of Hutang, with deep class feelings and strong revolutionary aspirations, take Chairman Mao's teachings to heart and put them into action. The old idea of "if you don't do it for yourself, heaven and earth will punish you," which has been left over from the old society for thousands of years, is being eliminated from people's minds. The new idea of "selflessly serving the people" has become the guiding principle for people's actions. The broad masses of cadres and peasants are devoted to the collective and are striding forward on the broad road of socialism. The transformation of Yu Xiuquan in Heye Production Team is an example. This female peasant used to not care much about the collective and rarely worked for the collective. The peasants had many complaints about her. During the socialist education movement, through recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, her class consciousness was raised, and she quickly bought a portrait of Chairman Mao from the street and hung it in what she considered the best place. She also asked someone to write a horizontal scroll that read, "Our whole family loves Chairman Mao."

Yu Xiuquan takes Chairman Mao's teachings seriously and executes them one by one. She repeatedly studied the three articles "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and decided to do more for the collective. Although she has five children, she still insists on working for the collective. This year, she has completed over 1,000 work points in agriculture and has also taken care of the team's oxen and sows. To take good care of the team's oxen, she divided her room into half to make a cow shed. When the sow gave birth to piglets, some of the piglets were sick, and she wrapped the little piglets in cotton and took care of them carefully. Yu Xiuquan has made rapid progress and has become a model for studying Chairman Mao's works in the entire commune.

Deng Shuguan from Yongfeng Production Team used to not care about collective affairs at all. After reading Chairman Mao's books, she completely changed. During the rush to harvest early rice and transplant late seedlings, she voluntarily mended clothes for the single men around her, so they could work with peace of mind. She also, for more than twenty consecutive days, used her own coal and tea leaves to boil water for the working peasants and personally delivered the tea water to the fields. While delivering the tea water, she would also take the opportunity to pull some seedlings or transplant some seedlings. When asked how she changed so quickly, she pointed to the quotation "selflessly serving the people" and said: "This is what Chairman Mao taught me."

Class Love Warms the Heart

Chairman Mao said: "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." Chairman Mao's teachings have deeply entered people's hearts. Liu Kehua and Yu Mintian, two poor peasant households in Yongfeng Production Team, had a dispute over a small matter. This spring, they both participated in the study of Chairman Mao's works organized by the production team. During a study discussion meeting, Liu Kehua and Yu Mintian compared themselves with Chairman Mao's teachings and conducted self-examinations. One said, "I did not care for my class brothers and instead caused disunity, which was wrong." The other said, "I did not say it to his face but talked behind his back, which was also wrong due to liberalism." Chairman Mao's teachings made these two households live in harmony. Later, Yu Mintian often visited Liu's home for heart-to-heart talks. Liu Kehua saw that Yu's house needed repairs and voluntarily, together with other peasants, helped Yu's family repair the house.

When one person has difficulties, everyone helps; when one team has difficulties, all teams support. Caring for class brothers has become a conscious action of the masses. The women and youth of Xintan Production Team enthusiastically helped the self-reliant production team, delivering Chairman Mao's quotations and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and explaining to the illiterate housewives separately. They also did many good deeds for the families in difficulty. Their care made the members of the self-reliant team very moved, and they expressed their determination to catch up. Chen Dongxiu, the women's team leader of Heye Production Team, based on Chairman Mao's teachings of "caring for the people's livelihood and paying attention to work methods," regarded the difficulties of the peasants as her own difficulties. She managed firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and also managed childbirth. In March this year, the wife of the poor peasant Li Hangguang had a difficult childbirth, and she voluntarily went to Yujia Bank to invite a doctor. Taking the big road to Yujia Bank would take time, but taking the small road would require crossing the river and wading through water. What to do? She thought: Comrade Norman Bethune was a foreigner and still came to China to help the revolution. I am a women's team leader and still cannot serve the team members? She thought of this and was not afraid of any difficulties, so she invited the doctor.

Breaking Old Habits, Establishing New Customs

Mao Zedong Thought has deeply entered the hearts of the peasants of Hutang, who are determined to sweep away the poison left over from the old society and build a new socialist countryside. Many peasant households have set up evaluation columns and hung merit books. They use Mao Zedong Thought as the standard for measuring everything. Now, everyone reads red books and sings revolutionary songs. Those old place names and personal names with feudal and bourgeois colors are being changed in batches. The feudal superstitions that have been prevalent for thousands of years are being spit out by the peasants. As early as the Spring Festival, after the peasants studied "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" they voluntarily destroyed the statues of Buddha and ancestral tablets. Old member Wang Haichun of the newly built production team, after liberation, still hid the "Black Public Buddha" in the attic and secretly worshipped it. After studying Chairman Mao's works, Wang Haichun and his wife Huang Shuyuan discussed together. Huang Shuyuan said: "Our country is created by the laboring people, not dropped from the sky. You have believed in Buddha for half your life, why did Buddha not send you a grain of rice or a cent in the old society when you begged for more than ten years? Why did Buddha not save one of your four brothers?" Wang Haichun thought about it and found it reasonable. We have stood up and become masters, all thanks to Chairman Mao leading us in making the revolution. If it were not for Chairman Mao leading, there would be no today. He said: "I will no longer be superstitious and will no longer be fooled by the exploiting class. In the future, I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow the Communist Party forever."

The great changes in the spiritual outlook of the peasants of Hutang are the result of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, accelerate their own ideological transformation, and under the leadership of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, turn Hutang into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲  千好万好毛主席著作第一好
    ——荷塘大队农民活学活用毛主席著作精神面貌焕然一新
    毛主席是我们心中最红最红的太阳。毛泽东思想一经被广大工农兵群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量。湖南省宁乡县双凫铺公社荷塘大队社员，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，短短一年时间，人们的精神面貌就发生了深刻的巨大的变化。
    听毛主席的话  走社会主义的路
    近年来，这个大队的广大社员经过忆苦思甜，更加热爱毛主席，热爱伟大的毛泽东思想。全大队掀起了学习毛主席著作热潮。现在，全大队有一所共产主义夜校，家家有毛主席像，处处有毛主席语录，许多家有毛主席著作，许多人写了学习心得。
    荷塘农民无限热爱毛主席，把毛主席的书当作闹翻身、干革命的宝书。他们说：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千好万好毛主席著作第一好。”“一天不吃饭可以，一天不读毛主席的书，思想就会落后。”新塘生产队五保户李象贤，今年七十五岁了，每逢集体学习，都要拄着拐杖去参加。他说：“在旧社会，像我这样年老的孤人，有谁管哪？今天的幸福，全是毛主席的恩情。毛主席的话，句句讲在我们心上。我活一天，就要学一天毛主席的书。”永丰生产队贫农女社员萧元贞，没有上过学，经常叫孩子念毛主席的书给她听。每逢集体学习，她从不缺席。荷塘农民如饥似渴地读毛主席的书。大队党支部宣传委员说：“我们贫下中农不读毛主席的书，用什么闹革命？听毛主席的话，走社会主义的路，脚有劲；担革命担子，肩有劲。毛主席他老人家的教导，使我们全身都是劲。”
    一心为集体
    荷塘农民带着深厚的阶级感情和强烈的革命愿望，把毛主席的教导，一字一句地记在心上，用在行动上。几千年来旧社会遗留下来的“人不为己，天诛地灭”的旧思想，正从人们的思想深处被清除掉，“毫不利己专门利人”的新思想，已成为人们的行动指南。广大干部、社员，一心为集体，在社会主义康庄大道上奋勇前进。荷叶塘生产队喻秀全的转变，便是一个例子。这位女社员，过去不大关心集体，很少出集体工。社员对她很有意见。在社会主义教育运动中，通过忆苦思甜，她的无产阶级觉悟提高了，连忙从街上买回了一张毛主席像，挂在她认为最好的地方。还请别人给写了“我们全家都爱毛主席”的横联。
    喻秀全对毛主席的教导，一字一句都认真去执行。她反复学习了《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》三篇文章，决心多为集体做事。她虽然带着五个小孩，仍坚持出集体工。今年已做农业工一千多分，还为队里喂了耕牛和母猪。为了给队里喂好耕牛，她把自己的房子隔出半间做牛栏。母猪生了崽，有的猪崽病了，她就用棉絮把小崽包起来，细心照料。喻秀全进步很快，成为全公社学习毛主席著作的标兵。
    永丰生产队邓淑群，过去从不管集体的事。读了毛主席的书，也完全变样了。在抢收早稻、抢插晚秧时，她主动为周围的单身汉缝补衣服，让他们安心出工。她还一连二十多天，用自己的煤，自己的茶叶，为劳动的社员烧茶水，并亲自把茶水送到田间。在送茶水的时候，还要趁空扯一会秧或插一会秧。有人问她怎么变得这么快，她指着语录“毫不利己专门利人”说：“这是毛主席他老人家教导我的。”
    阶级友爱暖人心
    毛主席说：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”毛主席的这一教导已深入人心。永丰生产队廖克华和喻敏天两户贫农社员，为了一点小事闹意见。今年春天，他们都参加了生产队组织的毛主席著作学习。在一次学习讨论会上，廖克华和喻敏天就对照毛主席的教导，自我检查。一个说，对阶级兄弟我没有关心，反而闹不团结，是个错误。一个说，我当面不说，背后乱说，犯了自由主义，也是不对的。毛主席的教导，使这两户和睦相处了。后来，喻敏天常到廖家串门谈心。廖克华见喻家房子需要新修，主动和其他社员一道，帮助喻家新修了房屋。
    一人有困难，众人相帮；一队有困难，各队支援。关心阶级兄弟，已成为群众性的自觉行动。新塘生产队的妇女和青少年，热情帮助自力生产队，去送毛主席语录，宣传毛泽东思想，分别给那些不识字的家庭妇女讲解。还帮助困难户做了许多好事。他们的关心，使自力队的社员很受感动，表示要迎头赶上。荷叶塘生产队妇女队长陈冬秀，根据毛主席“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”的教导，把社员的困难看成自己的困难。柴米油盐她都管，生儿育女她也管。今年三月，贫农李汉光的爱人生小孩难产，她主动到余家坝请医生。到余家坝走大路耽误时间，走小路要过河涉水。怎么办？她想：白求恩同志是外国人，还到中国帮助革命，我是妇女队长，还不能为本队社员服务吗？她想到这里，什么困难也不怕，就请来了医生。
    破旧习，树新风
    毛泽东思想深入人心，荷塘农民决心扫掉旧社会遗毒，建设社会主义新农村。许多社员家里，设立了评比栏，挂起了记功簿。他们用毛泽东思想作为衡量一切人的标准。现在，大家都看红色书籍，唱革命歌曲。那些带有封建主义、资产阶级色彩的旧地名、旧人名，在一批批地更改。流毒几千年的封建迷信思想，正被农民所唾弃。早在春节时，社员们学习了《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》以后，就自动起来毁掉菩萨和神祖牌子。新建生产队老社员王海秋，解放后，还把“黑公菩萨”藏在楼上，暗自敬奉。学习了毛主席著作以后，王海秋和他爱人黄淑元在一起议论。黄淑元说：“我们的国家，都是劳动人民创造的，不是从天上掉下来的，你信了大半世菩萨，为什么在旧社会讨饭十多年，菩萨没有给你送来一粒米，一分钱；为什么你四个兄弟死了三个，菩萨没有给救活一个。”王海秋一想，觉得很有道理。我们翻身做主人，完全是毛主席领导我们闹革命的结果。要不是毛主席领导，那有今天。他说：“我再不迷信了，再不上剥削阶级那个当啦。我今后一定要听毛主席的话，永远跟共产党走。”
    荷塘农民精神面貌的巨大变化，是活学活用毛主席著作的结果。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，加速自己的思想革命化，在我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的领导下，把荷塘办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
