Revolutionary helmsman Chairman Mao's four-volume red book is the truth.
Every word and sentence speaks of revolution.
Generation after generation cannot part from it.

People in Hebei, Shanghai, Jinan, and other places enthusiastically welcome the arrival of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

Weapons of Battle, Guides to Action

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Baoding, since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to accelerate the mass publication of Chairman Mao's works more than a month ago, it is estimated that Hebei Province has already printed and distributed 480,000 copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and more than 8 million copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres regard the day they receive "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as "the happiest day" and "the most unforgettable moment." They sing revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red," "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and "I Love to Read Chairman Mao's Book" over and over again. After receiving "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," many people enthusiastically discuss their thoughts and express their boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao. They say, Chairman Mao's works are our weapons of battle, sources of strength, driving forces, and guides to action.

In factories, rural areas, shops, schools, and offices, after obtaining "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," people universally launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They express their determination to always carry Chairman Mao's works with them, to learn and apply them in struggles, to care about state affairs, and to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.
