In the villages and towns around Xingtai, there is a team of propagandists wearing red star caps and red armbands, promoting Mao Zedong Thought. This team includes old cadres who have grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, and new "youngsters" who have emerged as active learners and users of Chairman Mao's works. These soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, whether in the plains or the mountains, wherever they go, are warmly welcomed by the people. People sing and dance to greet them, singing, "Welcome, dear ones, we've been waiting for you. You've brought us gifts a thousand times heavier, and Chairman Mao's thoughts to our door!"

How do they bring the great Mao Zedong Thought to the doorstep? Here are some fragments of many touching stories.

Bringing Mao Zedong Thought to Every Corner

"No matter how high the mountains are, how far the roads are, wherever there are poor and lower-middle peasants, even if it's just one household, we must bring Mao Zedong Thought to their door!" The soldiers, with deep proletarian feelings, spread Mao Zedong Thought from village to village, household to household. Their slogan is: We must definitely plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in every corner.

In the foothills of the Taihang Mountains, a small squad led by Platoon Leader Xiao Youming arrived at Xitaizi Commune. They walked from one village to another. Later, they heard that on a high and steep mountain top, there was a small village called Jiajiaping with thirteen households. Because it was inconvenient to get there, the commune members worriedly told them, "Don't go! It's too far, hard to walk! And there aren't many people." The commune cadres also advised them not to go. But the soldiers firmly said, "Promoting Mao Zedong Thought doesn't distinguish between near and far roads, many or few people. As long as there are class brothers living there, we have the responsibility to let them read Chairman Mao's books and hear Chairman Mao's instructions."

That day, it was raining, but the soldiers shouldered the language boards, carried the film projector, and lifted a 180-pound generator, and immediately set off.

As soon as they entered the village, the soldiers shouted, "Dear villagers, Chairman Mao has sent us to visit you!" The small mountain village immediately buzzed with excitement. An old poor peasant tightly grasped the soldier's hand and asked, "Is Chairman Mao in good health?" The soldiers replied, "Chairman Mao is in very good health." The commune members heard this and all smiled, feeling immense happiness. Then, the soldiers read Chairman Mao's books to the commune members, explained Chairman Mao's instructions on preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people, and reminisced about the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society with the commune members. Soon, a giant banner appeared on the mountaintop: "Standing on the Taihang Mountains, with the world in our hearts." At night, the rain still didn't stop, but the film crew set up a projector in the cow shed to show a movie to the commune members. When the screen showed our great leader Chairman Mao, the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" suddenly rose, immediately drowning out the sound of the wind and rain. The commune members, to commemorate this day, unanimously requested to erect a monument: "On April 27, 1966, Chairman Mao sent the PLA to visit us, and showed a movie in the cow shed, forever memorable!"

In Shuimen Brigade, Bu Shengtang, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a five-star soldier, heard during his propaganda work that seven miles away on a high mountain, there lived an old man who had herded sheep for a landlord for forty years and had his right arm broken by the landlord. Bu Shengtang, filled with class feelings, thought: I should go visit him and bring Chairman Mao's teachings and care to the old man's heart. He put Chairman Mao's Little Red Book in his pocket and ran all the way to the mountain. As soon as he saw the old man, he said, "Grandpa, I am your son. Tell me what you need." The old man was both surprised and delighted, asking, "Who are you?" "I am a soldier sent by Chairman Mao." With these words, the old man's eyes welled up with tears. Bu Shengtang treated the old man better than his own family, reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to him on the kang (a traditional Chinese bed), explaining how Chairman Mao cares for the people in disaster-stricken areas. He also helped the old man wash the pot, wash the dishes, and mend clothes.

One night, the brigade was going to show a movie with scenes of Chairman Mao, and before the screening, the troops were going to explain Chairman Mao's instructions. Bu Shengtang thought: It's not easy for the old man to see a movie and hear Chairman Mao's teachings. Today, I must carry him there. But the old man wouldn't let him carry him, saying, "Child, the road is too far, you can't carry me!" Bu Shengtang patted his chest and said, "Grandpa, I have plenty of strength, come on!" On the way, they crossed mountains and valleys, panting and sweating. Bu Shengtang was covered in sweat, and the old man's eyes were filled with tears. Their sweat and tears mingled together, their closeness was indescribable. After watching the movie and attending the meeting, Bu Shengtang carried the old man back home as usual. The old man said with infinite gratitude, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao, the children you have taught are truly good, treating us poor and lower-middle peasants so nobly!"

There are countless such scenes and examples like those in Jiajiaping and Bu Shengtang. Only soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought can show such boundless enthusiasm and loyalty to the people, and spread the great Mao Zedong Thought to every village and corner.

Following Chairman Mao's Teachings to Set an Example

The power of example is immense. When the soldiers promote Mao Zedong Thought, they follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, first being servants, then propagandists. "Silent propaganda" teaches the broad masses the living Mao Zedong Thought.

In Xiangjiazhuang, a soldier named Wang Jianlin came. At night, he led everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, and during the day, he worked in the fields with the commune members. No matter how dirty or tiring the work was, he did it. During the drought, fetching water was the hardest work, so he volunteered to fetch water. Once, a water bucket fell into the well. At that time, it was still very cold, but he took off his clothes and dove into the well to retrieve the bucket. The commune members tried to stop him, but he thought: Now the drought is so severe, losing one bucket means losing one part of the drought-fighting strength. We talk about serving the people every day, and now is the time to serve the people! He ignored the commune members' attempts to stop him and retrieved the bucket from the well. When the commune members praised him, he said, "This is what Chairman Mao wants me to do." And he studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with everyone, telling the commune members, "Studying Chairman Mao's works means learning a bit, using a bit, and using it especially at critical moments."

In Huohongkang Village, there is a story circulating: During the rush to plant, a soldier came to spread Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as he arrived, he went to the fields, bare-chested, with his pants rolled up, working very hard. He carried the biggest buckets of water, often shouldering one and carrying another in his hand. The commune members called him "One and a Half." Everyone asked him, "What's your surname?" He said, "My surname is Jie." Everyone then called him "Comrade Jie." After a day, two days, six or seven days, every day he worked like this. The commune members asked him his name again, and he replied, "My name is Fangjun." From then on, the commune members called him "Comrade Fangjun." As they called him, someone later said, "Isn't it wrong? This comrade's surname is Jie and his name is Fangjun. Together, isn't it 'Liberation Army'?" The people finally realized. But by then, this "Comrade Fangjun" had already gone to another village to spread Mao Zedong Thought.

This soldier did not leave his true name, but he left a deep impression on the people. They unanimously said, "No wonder he always studies 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' with us. This is what serving the people is all about! Serving the people to the point of not leaving a name." The villagers then began to recite these words: "Chairman Mao's works, the Liberation Army's example! How to study Chairman Mao's works, you should study like the Liberation Army; how to do what Chairman Mao says, you should do like the Liberation Army." The people's enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works increased, their production spirit was stronger, and good deeds became more common. At night, people often voluntarily went to spread manure, and by the time the team leader went to check, the person who spread the manure had already disappeared. When it rained, the production team's property was well-covered, but no one knew who covered it. People said, "This is the seed that 'Comrade Liberation Army' planted."

Such examples are almost in every village and brigade. It influences the youth and motivates the elderly. There is an old man named Guo Sihen. From the moment the propaganda team entered the village, he paid close attention to the soldiers' every move. He found that these soldiers, no matter how busy they were with work, would take out a red book and read from it whenever they had a moment. When they encountered difficulties, they also read from this red book, and after doing good deeds for the people, they still read from this red book. One evening, he saw the soldiers reading again and curiously approached. Only then did he know that the soldiers were reading Chairman Mao's quotations on serving the people.

That night, this old man, who had been a long-term laborer in the old society for more than twenty years and was over seventy years old, tossed and turned, unable to sleep. The words "serving the people," "completely," and "thoroughly" that he heard from the soldiers kept spinning in his mind. He thought: The Liberation Army listens to Chairman Mao's words, and I should also listen to Chairman Mao's words and do things "completely" and "thoroughly." Thinking and thinking, he thought of the team's current lack of people to feed the livestock. As soon as it was dawn, he went to the team leader and requested to feed the livestock. The team leader initially did not want to let him feed the livestock. He said, "You may be old, but I have experience in feeding livestock. I can still serve the people, even if I can't add a jin, I can add two jins!" The team leader agreed, and from then on, he ate and slept in the livestock shed, feeding the livestock to be fat and healthy. The old man happily said, "Listening to Chairman Mao's words and doing things like the Liberation Army is correct."

Bringing Mao Zedong Thought Deep into the Hearts of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

During the days of promoting Mao Zedong Thought, the soldiers not only spread it everywhere, but many also voluntarily formed "red pairs" with the poor and lower-middle peasants, eating and sleeping together, reading Chairman Mao's books to them word by word, and helping them raise their proletarian consciousness bit by bit. The soldiers said, "We must bring Mao Zedong Thought into the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

One day, cook Zhang Zhan and his comrades crossed mountain after mountain and arrived at a village late at night. They were about to rest when they heard that the old poor peasant, the livestock feeder Zhen Bihui, had a knot in his heart because the masses had given him some criticisms, and he no longer wanted to do this "job." Zhang Zhan, without resting, immediately went to the livestock shed. As soon as he entered the courtyard, he started working, carrying water, sweeping the ground, chopping grass, and adding feed, busy all the time. The old livestock feeder was very moved. Zhang Zhan knew the old man's worries, so he explained to him Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people and criticism and self-criticism. The old man listened and said, "Chairman Mao is right! Serving the people means not being afraid of criticism from others, but with my temper, it's better to do something else." After saying this, he went to add feed to the livestock. Zhang Zhan thought: Grandpa Zhen's knot is not completely untied, what should I do?

The next evening after dinner, the neighboring village was showing the movie "By the Ditch." Zhang Zhan thought this was a good opportunity, so he ran to the livestock shed and said, "Grandpa, you go watch the movie, I'll watch the livestock." Grandpa said, "Alright!" That night after watching the movie, the two lay down on the same bed like father and son, but neither could sleep. Zhang Zhan asked, "Grandpa, how was the movie?" "The landlord Tang Shandian is really cruel, wanting to hold onto the bridle and whip, digging at the foundations of socialism." "Yes! Livestock is half of our production team's sky! The whip and bridle should be in the hands of the most reliable person! Otherwise, we'll fall for the enemy's tricks." The old man heard this and his mind buzzed. Zhang Zhan continued, "Grandpa, let me read a passage from Chairman Mao to you." He read, "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you attack them, you attack the revolution." Chairman Mao's words were like a master key, opening any lock. The old man's mind was enlightened, and he excitedly said, "Yes, we poor and lower-middle peasants must not let go of the revolutionary bridle and whip, who else can we hand it over to? My temper doesn't matter, as Chairman Mao says, we'll change." The next day, this stubborn old man went from house to house seeking opinions.

The old poor peasant Zhen Bihui, after listening to Chairman Mao's words, took big steps forward. Countless poor and lower-middle peasants and hundreds of villages, after listening to Chairman Mao's words, also took big steps forward.

Leaving Behind a Non-Departing Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team

Soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have a far-reaching vision and a broad mind. In their propaganda activities, they also, with the greatest enthusiasm, trained thousands and tens of thousands of red propagandists in the local countryside. These people became Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams that never leave their hometowns.

In Niujiqiao Brigade, the Fourth Company soldiers invited the militia to come. The soldiers taught them one by one, hand in hand, how to actively learn and use Chairman Mao's works, and introduced in detail the learning experiences of Liao Chujian, Feng Fusheng, and Huang Zushi. They discussed with them how to be good Mao Zedong Thought propagandists. Political Instructor Pan Wenbin personally guided the team secretary Gu Huanyin. Pan Wenbin's hands never left Chairman Mao's books, his mouth never left Chairman Mao's words, and his actions never left Chairman Mao's teachings, leaving a deep impression on Gu Huanyin. Soon, Gu Huanyin, like Pan Wenbin, carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with him, learning and lecturing wherever he went. In the team meetings, in the militia meetings, in the fields, and at the village entrances, he lectured on Chairman Mao's works everywhere. Now, Gu Huanyin has not only become an excellent propagandist but also an active learner of Chairman Mao's works.

Among the large number of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams trained by the soldiers, there is a famous "Nine Sisters" propaganda team in the disaster-stricken areas. These nine young women had always wanted to change the backward face of the production team through promoting Mao Zedong Thought, but due to various concerns, they had not been able to achieve it. The soldiers came and, after learning about the situation, first studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Moving Mountains" with them, strengthening their confidence. They also researched propaganda methods with them and took them to the village entrances and field edges to conduct propaganda activities. After repeated help, the nine sisters all became excellent Mao Zedong Thought propagandists. Now, the "Nine Sisters" propaganda team, like the Liberation Army, actively organizes the commune members to study Chairman Mao's works, whether it is day or night, in the fields or at the village entrances. The entire production team, under their help, has made studying Chairman Mao's works a common practice, with every household and person studying and putting it into practice.

Now, although the Liberation Army soldiers have left the vast villages around Xingtai, thousands and tens of thousands of Mao Zedong Thought propagandists have grown up. They are continuing to write new chapters in the promotion of Mao Zedong Thought!

    一支出色的毛泽东思想宣传队
    ——解放军某部在邢台地区传播毛泽东思想纪实
    在邢台周围的村村镇镇里，有一支佩戴红星帽徽、红领章的毛泽东思想宣传队。这支宣传队当中，有在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的老干部，有新涌现出来的活学活用毛主席著作的“小将”。这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士，在平原，在山区，凡是他们足迹所到的地方，都受到了人民群众的热烈欢迎。人们载歌载舞来迎接他们，唱道：“迎亲人，盼亲人，亲人来到俺们村，礼物带来千斤重，主席思想送上门！”
    他们是怎样把伟大的毛泽东思想送上门的？这里，记述的是许许多多动人事迹中的一些片断。
    把毛泽东思想传遍每个角落
    “不管山多高，路多远，哪里有贫下中农，那怕是一户一人，也要把毛泽东思想送上门！”指战员们怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，逐村挨户传播着毛泽东思想。他们的口号是：一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插到每个角落。
    在太行山东麓，连长肖佑明率领的一个小分队来到了西太子公社。他们走了一村又一村。后来他们听说在一个山高路陡的一个山顶上，还有一个叫贾家坪的十三户人家的小村子。因为这里来往不便，社员们都关切地对他们说：
  “不要去了吧！太远，不好走！人又不多。”公社干部也劝他们不要去。可是战士们坚定地说：“宣传毛泽东思想不能分路远路近，人多人少，只要那里住有阶级兄弟，我们就有责任让他们读到毛主席的书，听到毛主席的指示。”
    那天，正下着雨，战士们扛起语录牌，背上电影放映机，又抬起一百八十多斤重的发电机，立即出发了。
    一进村，战士们就喊：“乡亲们，毛主席派我们看望你们来了！”小小山村顿时沸腾起来，一位老贫农紧紧握着战士的手问：“毛主席他老人家身体可好？”战士们回答说：“毛主席身体好得很。”社员们听了，个个露出笑容，感到莫大的幸福。接着，战士们给社员读毛主席的书，讲毛主席关于备战、备荒、为人民的指示，并和社员一起忆旧社会的苦，谈新社会的甜。很快，山顶上出现了一幅“站在太行山，胸怀全世界”的巨幅标语。晚上，雨仍然没停，电影组就在牛棚里为社员放电影，当银幕上出现我们伟大领袖毛主席的镜头时，“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”的欢呼声骤起，立时盖过了风声、雨声。社员们为了纪念这个日子，一致要求立一块碑，刻上：一九六六年四月二十七日，毛主席派解放军来看望，在牛棚放电影，万世流芳！
    在水门大队，学习毛主席著作积极分子、五好战士卜生堂，在宣传中听说七里开外的高山上，住着一位给地主放过四十年羊、被地主打断右臂的残废老人。卜生堂满怀阶级感情地想：我应该去看望他，把毛主席的教导和关怀送到老人的心里。他揣上毛主席语录本，一路小跑来到山上。一见老人面就说：“老大爷，我就是你的儿子，有啥事你就吩咐吧！”老人家又惊又喜，问道：“你是谁呀？”“我是毛主席派来的解放军战士。”一句话说得老人家热泪盈眶。卜生堂把老人看得比亲人还亲，在炕上给老大爷念《毛主席语录》，讲毛主席怎么关心灾区人民。又帮老大爷刷锅、洗碗、缝衣服。
    一天晚上，大队里要放映有毛主席镜头的电影，放映前部队还准备宣讲毛主席的指示。卜生堂想：老大爷很不容易看上电影，听上毛主席的教导，今天一定要背他去。可是老人怎么也不让他背，说：“孩子，路太远，背不动呀！”卜生堂把胸膛一拍说：“老大爷，我有的是劲，来吧！”路上，他们翻山越岭，气喘吁吁，卜生堂汗流浃背，老大爷泪花滚滚，他们的汗水和泪水交流在一起，那个亲乎劲啊，说也没法说。看完电影，开完会，卜生堂又照样把他背回来。这位老大爷无限感激地说：“毛主席呀！毛主席，你教导出来的孩子好的没法说，把俺贫下中农看得真高贵呀！”
    像贾家坪那种场面，像卜生堂这种事例，何止万千！只有毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，才能在人民面前，无限热情，无限忠心，才能把伟大的毛泽东思想传遍村村寨寨，每个角落。
    照毛主席的教导做好样子
    榜样的力量是巨大的。战士们在宣传毛泽东思想的时候，都是按照毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，先当勤务员，再当宣传员。“无声的宣传”使广大人民学到了活的毛泽东思想。
    在相家庄，来了个叫王建林的战士，晚上领着大家学习毛主席著作，白天和社员一起下地。什么活脏活累，他干什么。抗旱时，打水最累，他就抢着打水。有一次，一只水桶掉到井里去了。当时天还很冷，他脱下衣服就下井捞桶，社员拦着他，他想：现在抗旱这么紧张，少一只桶就少一分抗旱力量，我们天天讲为人民服务，现在正是为人民服务的时候！他不顾社员拦阻，下井把桶捞上来。社员们称赞他的时候，他说：“这是毛主席要我这样做的。”并且和大家一起学习了《为人民服务》，告诉社员“学习毛主席著作要学一点，用一点，在节骨眼上更要用。”
    在霍洪康村流传这样一个故事：在抢种的日子里，来了个传播毛泽东思想的战士。他一来就下地，光着膀子，卷起裤腿，干得特别起劲，担水拣大桶，常常是肩挑一担，手提一桶，社员们称他“一担半”。大家问他：“姓啥？”他说：“姓解。”大家就叫他“老解同志”。一天，两天，六七天，每天他都是这样干。社员又问他叫什么名字，他回答说：“叫放军。”从此社员又叫他“放军同志”。叫着，叫着，后来有人说：“不对吧？这同志姓解名放军，合起来不就是‘解放军’吗？”人们这才恍然大悟。可是，这时这位“放军”同志已到别的村传播毛泽东思想去了。
      这个战士没有留下真名真姓，但是却给群众留下了很深的影响，他们不约而同地说：“怪不得人家老和咱们学习《为人民服务》，人家这才叫为人民服务！服了务连个姓名都不留。”这个村的群众从此就传诵着这么几句话：“毛主席的著作，解放军的榜样！”“毛主席的书怎么学，要像解放军那样学；毛主席的话怎么做，要像解放军那样做。”人们学习毛主席著作的热情更高了，生产劲头更足了，好人好事越来越多。夜里经常有人自动去送粪，等到队长去检查，送粪的人早已无影无踪了。下雨，生产队的财物盖得好好的，谁盖的也找不着。人们说：“这都是那位‘解放军’播下的种子。”
    这样的事例几乎村村有，队队有。它影响着青年人，也带动了老年人。有个叫郭四恨的老人，从宣传队一进村，他就留心战士们的一举一动。他发现这些战士不论干活多忙，一有空就掏出个鲜红的本本读起来，遇到困难也读这个红本本，给群众做了好事还读这个红本本。一天晚上，他见战士又在读，就好奇地凑上去，这才知道战士们读的是毛主席有关为人民服务的语录。
    晚上，这位在旧社会当过二十多年长工的年过七旬的老人，翻过来，倒过去，怎么也睡不着，他从战士们那里听到的“为人民服务”“完全”“彻底”这几句话在脑子里转来转去。他想：解放军听毛主席的话，咱也要听毛主席的话，办事也得“完全”“彻底”。想呀想呀，他想起了队里眼下缺喂牲口的人。天刚亮，他就向队长要求喂牲口。队长开始不肯让他喂。他说：“你别看我上了几岁年纪，可我有喂牲口的经验，我还能为人民服务，不能添斤，也能添两嘛！”队长答应了，从此他就吃睡在牲口棚，把牲口喂得膘肥体壮。老人高兴地说：“听毛主席的话，照解放军的样子去做，没错。”
    让毛泽东思想深入贫下中农心窝
    在传播毛泽东思想的日子里，战士们不光是到处讲，到处传，许多人还主动与贫下中农结成“一对红”，同他们吃在一起，睡在一起，一字一句地给他们读毛主席的书，一点一滴地帮助他们提高无产阶级觉悟。战士们说：“我们一定要把毛泽东思想送进贫下中农的心窝里。”
    一天，炊事员张占硬和战友一起翻过一座座高山，天很晚才走进一个村庄。他们正准备休息，却听说村里的老贫农饲养员仲伯惠，因为群众给他提了些批评意见，心里结上了疙瘩，不想再干这“差事”了。张占硬顾不得休息，立即来到牲口棚，一进院就干起活来了，担水、扫地、铡草、添料，忙个不停。老饲养员很是感动。张占硬知道老人的心事，就给他讲毛主席关于为人民服务和批评与自我批评的教导。老人听了说：“毛主席说的对！为人民服务，就不能怕别人批评，不过像咱这炮筒子脾气，还是干别的好。”说完，就给牲口添饲料去了。张占硬想：仲大爷疙瘩还没有完全解开，怎么办？
    第二天晚饭后，邻村放映《箭杆河边》电影。张占硬觉得这是个好机会，就跑到牲口棚说：“大爷，你去看电影，我替你看牲口。”大爷说：“行！”这天夜里，看罢电影，他俩就像父子一样，躺在一个铺上睡觉了。但谁也睡不着。张占硬开口问道：“大爷，电影咋样？”“地主佟善田真狠，想抓住笼头、鞭杆不放，挖社会主义墙脚。”“是啊！牲口是咱生产队半边天啊！鞭子、笼头应该掌在最可靠人的手里！不然就会上敌人的当。”老人一听，脑子里嗡嗡起来。张占硬接着说：“大爷，我再给你念一段毛主席的话吧。”他念道：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”毛主席的话，像一把万能钥匙，不论什么锁，都一按就开。老人心里亮了，激动地说：“对，咱贫下中农不抓住革命的笼头、鞭子，还能交给谁？炮筒脾气不要紧，按毛主席说的，咱改。”第二天，这位倔强的老人就挨家逐户地征求意见去了。
    老贫农仲伯惠听了毛主席的话，大步前进了。千万个贫下中农，千百个村庄，听了毛主席的话也都大步朝前走。
    留下一支不走的毛泽东思想宣传队
    毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，眼光远大，胸怀开阔，他们在宣传活动中还以最大的热情，为当地农村培养出了千千万万个红色宣传员。这些人变成了一支支不离开本地的毛泽东思想宣传队。
    在牛家桥大队，四连指战员把基干民兵请来了，战士们一个带一个，手把手地教他们活学活用毛主席著作，详详细细地介绍廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示的学习经验，和他们一起讨论怎样当一个好的毛泽东思想宣传员。指导员潘文斌亲手帮带团支书谷焕印，潘文斌手不离毛主席的书，嘴不离毛主席的话，行动不离毛主席教导，给谷焕印很深很深的印象。不久，谷焕印也像潘文斌一样，《毛主席语录》随身带，走到那，学到那，讲到那，在团支部会上，在民兵会上，在田间、村头，到处讲毛主席的书。现在，谷焕印不仅成了一个出色的宣传员，而且成了学习毛主席著作的积极分子。
    战士们培养的大批毛泽东思想宣传队中，有一个闻名灾区的九姐妹宣传队。这九个女青年过去总想通过宣传毛泽东思想来改变生产队的后进面貌，由于她们有种种顾虑，一直没有实现。战士们来了，了解到这一情况后，先和她们一起学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》，坚定信心，又和她们一起研究宣传方法，并带她们到村头、田边进行宣传活动。经过反复帮助，九姐妹个个都成了出色的毛泽东思想宣传员。现在，九姐妹宣传队像解放军一样，不论是白天还是晚上，不论在地边还是村头，都能积极组织社员学习毛主席著作。整个生产队在她们帮助下，学习毛主席著作蔚然成风，户户学，人人学，学了就用。
    如今解放军战士虽然离开了邢台周围广大村庄，但千千万万个毛泽东思想的宣传员成长起来了，他们正在继续书写传播毛泽东思想的新篇章！
