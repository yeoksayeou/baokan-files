The revolutionary workers at the Lanzhou Refinery have, in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, redoubled their efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide and transform everything. They hold the pen in one hand to criticize the bourgeoisie, and the tool in the other to produce more and better oil. Since the beginning of this year, the refinery has exceeded the state's production plan every month and successfully developed a batch of new products. In August, the processing volume of crude oil reached a record high since the factory's establishment. The total yield of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil—the four major product categories—has all increased compared to the plan, and the quality of all products meets the state's requirements.

Since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the refinery has organized two leadership teams: one primarily focused on the cultural revolution, and the other on production. Additionally, a group of office and department cadres were dispatched to production workshops to stay on-site, living, eating, and working with the workers. Together, they study Chairman Mao's works, participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, assist the grassroots in promoting revolution and production, and solve key production issues.

    兰州炼油厂月月超额完成计划
    四大类产品质量全部符合要求
    据新华社兰州十三日电　兰州炼油厂广大革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中，更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切。他们一手拿笔杆，批判资产阶级；一手拿工具，多炼油炼好油。今年以来，这个厂月月超额完成国家生产计划，并且试制成功一批新产品。八月份原油加工处理量创造建厂以来最高纪录，汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油四大类产品的总收率，都比计划有所提高，产品质量全部符合国家要求。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，这个厂组织了两个领导班子，一个班子主要抓文化革命，一个班子主要抓生产。同时，抽调了一批机关科室干部，到生产车间蹲点，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，一起学习毛主席著作，参加无产阶级文化大革命，协助基层抓革命，促生产，解决生产关键问题。
