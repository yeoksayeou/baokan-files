Title: A Revisionist Party Charter - Critique of the Former Beijing Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department's "Basic Knowledge of the Party"
Author: Hong Haisheng

Edition: 6

The former Beijing Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department's "Basic Knowledge of the Party" is a poisonous weed that propagates revisionist ideas on party building. Under the guise of Marxism-Leninism, they use the pretext of teaching "basic knowledge of the party" to attempt to deny that Mao Zedong Thought is the sole guiding ideology of our party. Under the pretext of saying that the current basic task of our party is to "build socialism," they attempt to eliminate class struggle and eliminate the dictatorship of the proletariat, propagating the revisionist theory of class reconciliation. They spare no effort in slandering the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, and attacking the Party's three red banners.

"Basic Knowledge of the Party" is a product of the revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, serving their evil purposes of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. The revisionist lords of the former Beijing Municipal Committee regard this book as a treasure, distributing it in large quantities and promoting it everywhere. It has already had a very harmful effect. This poisonous weed must be thoroughly criticized, thoroughly eradicated, and its pernicious influence completely eliminated.

In our party-building education, we must use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, and use Chairman Mao's works as our textbooks. We must seriously study Chairman Mao's theories on party building and his discussions on Communist Party members. On the front of party-building education, we must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely oppose bourgeois ideology, revisionist ideology, and all other non-proletarian ideologies.

The former Beijing Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department's "Basic Knowledge of the Party" (hereinafter referred to as "Basic Knowledge") strives to resist and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, distorting and altering Mao Zedong's party-building line and theory, openly propagating revisionist ideas on party building.

From the content and editing time of "Basic Knowledge," it is clear that it was completely written under the guidance of the revisionist manifesto of the former Beijing Municipal Committee's "Frontline," to closely cooperate with the anti-Party clique's rampant attacks on the Party in the political, ideological, and cultural fronts. It is a black book that spreads revisionist poison to the broad base of cadres, Party members, and activists. In January 1961, Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was published, and in March and October 1961, Deng Tuo, Wu Han, and Liao Mosha's "Night Talks on Yan Mountain" and "Notes from Three Villages" were published. At this time, this "Basic Knowledge" was also published.

To defend Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly smash the evil plots of all bourgeois representatives to change the face of our Party, it is necessary to thoroughly expose and criticize the revisionist and reactionary nature of this "Basic Knowledge," eliminate the poison it spreads, and cleanse its reactionary influence.

Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought—whether to acknowledge or resist it, support or oppose it, love or hate it—is the dividing line between true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries, between revolution and counter-revolution, between Marxism and revisionism.

The "Basic Knowledge" published in 1961, with 65,000 characters, does not mention Mao Zedong Thought at all, and barely mentions studying Chairman Mao's works. This shows to what extent the revisionist elements of the former Beijing Municipal Committee resist, hate, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought! Due to the widespread and in-depth development of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among workers, peasants, and soldiers over the past few years, they felt that openly opposing Mao Zedong Thought was too blatant and needed some disguise. Therefore, in June 1965, they made some so-called "revisions" to this "Basic Knowledge," adding some words about "Mao Zedong Thought" and "studying Chairman Mao's works." However, their actions only further exposed their true face of opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

The first lecture of this "Basic Knowledge" is about the nature of the Party, but it only vaguely talks about the Chinese Communist Party being the vanguard of the Chinese working class, without discussing what determines the proletarian nature of our Party. Our Party is the Party founded and nurtured by Comrade Mao Zedong. It is a Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Our Party is a proletarian vanguard party that combines theory with practice, is closely linked with the masses, and has a serious spirit of self-criticism. Our Party is a proletarian revolutionary party that has gone through the most intense, arduous, long-term, and complex struggles in history. Our Party enjoys extremely high prestige among the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world. Comrade Mao Zedong is our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman. However, this book, which claims to teach the basic knowledge of the Party, does not mention these things that are decisive to the proletarian revolutionary nature of our Party at all. It is clear that their purpose is to remove the soul of our Party—Mao Zedong Thought—and to blur the image of our Party among the broad Party members and the masses, attempting to deny the great decisive role of Mao Zedong Thought in the proletarian revolutionary nature of our Party and to deny that our Party is a great, glorious, and correct Party.

The second lecture of this "Basic Knowledge" is about the Party's guiding ideology. Everyone knows that the guiding ideology of our Party is Mao Zedong Thought. As early as 1945, the General Program of the Party Constitution adopted at the Seventh National Congress of the Party clearly stipulated that Mao Zedong Thought should be used as the guiding principle for all the work of our Party. Through decades of practice in China's democratic revolution, socialist revolution, and socialist construction, and through the great struggle against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries in the international arena, it has been proven that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth that applies to all places, and is the sole correct guiding ideology of our Party. However, in this lecture, they use most of the space to abstractly discuss what Marxism-Leninism is, deliberately emphasizing the so-called "dialectical materialism" they have distorted and altered, but not mentioning that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of our Party. They only vaguely say, "Using the principles of Marxism-Leninism to flexibly and creatively solve the practical problems of the Chinese revolution is a consistent principle of our Party's thinking." This proves that they deliberately deny that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology of our Party.

In discussing the Party's highest ideals, current tasks, and other important issues, this "Basic Knowledge" does not mention Mao Zedong Thought. In this "Basic Knowledge," Mao Zedong Thought is completely in a position of being dispensable, becoming their greatest taboo, which fully exposes their stubborn resistance to, hatred of, and opposition to Mao Zedong Thought from a bourgeois reactionary standpoint.

This "Basic Knowledge" fundamentally opposes the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Even in the version revised in June 1965 and reprinted in the ninth edition in March 1966, not a single sentence about the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works can be found. The combination of theory and practice is an excellent tradition of our Party. In 1960, Comrade Lin Biao called on all officers and soldiers of the PLA to definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and truly master Mao Zedong Thought. In January 1961, Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's thought of combining theory with practice, proposed the principle of "studying with problems, actively studying and applying, combining study with use, learning urgently for immediate use, and seeing immediate results." In recent years, the Party Central Committee, the Military Commission, and Comrade Lin Biao have repeatedly emphasized that we must definitely emphasize politics, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially focus on the "use" aspect, and use Chairman Mao's books as the guiding principles for all our work. However, this "Basic Knowledge" goes against the call of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Lin Biao, not mentioning the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works at all. The reason is not that they are afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, but that they are afraid of Mao Zedong Thought combining with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Whether or not to acknowledge class struggle, and whether or not to insist on the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, has always been the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and all revisionism.

"Basic Knowledge" faithfully implements the revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, striving to oppose Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle in socialist society, fundamentally denying the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and denying the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao emphasized: "In our country, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation in the ownership system, 'class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm are still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense.'"

However, when discussing the highest ideals of our Party and the tasks of the current stage, this "Basic Knowledge" says that the current task of our Party is only to "build socialism." It emphasizes that "in the current stage, the fundamental interests of the people of our country are to strive to quickly build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture." In short, it only talks about construction, not class struggle; only talks about modernization, not revolutionization. The soul of the three great revolutionary movements indicated by Chairman Mao—class struggle—is completely castrated here. This is a pure "theory of the extinction of class struggle." How can we build socialism and realize the highest ideal of communism without class struggle and revolution?

Especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in 1962, Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: "Never forget class struggle." The former Beijing Municipal Committee strenuously resisted and opposed this extremely important instruction from Chairman Mao. In the revised edition of "Basic Knowledge" published in June 1965, except for adding a few sentences about "socialist revolution" and "class struggle, struggle between two lines" in a state of panic, they did not make any significant principled revisions, but continued to propagate their "theory of the extinction of class struggle."

This "Basic Knowledge" not only denies domestic class struggle but also denies international class struggle. In the 1961 edition, the entire book does not mention a word about opposing imperialism and opposing modern revisionism. In the revised edition of June 1965, due to the situation, they had to add a sentence "firmly oppose American imperialism" in the third lecture. However, regarding the issue of opposing modern revisionism, they still do not mention a word. They not only do not mention opposing modern revisionism but also deliberately propose a slogan of "firmly maintaining the unity of the socialist camp." Who are they asking us to "maintain unity" with? Our Party has always insisted that "socialist countries and the world communist movement must unite firmly on the basis of Marxism-Leninism." They, however, deliberately omit the fundamental premise of "uniting on the basis of Marxism-Leninism" and call for "unity" without principles. Isn't this clearly opposing our Party's struggle against revisionism? Obviously, they have completely sided with the revisionists of Khrushchev!

This "Basic Knowledge" does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat at all. Everyone knows that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm ultimately boils down to a struggle for leadership. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is to smash the plot of the bourgeois representatives to restore capitalism and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. This "Basic Knowledge" does not mention class struggle and does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat. Its purpose is to make us forget about class struggle and forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, so that they can do as they please and carry out their activities to restore capitalism.

Comrade Mao Zedong has always emphasized the importance of emphasizing politics and building the Party from a political and ideological standpoint. He pointed out, "Controlling ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to engage in great political struggles." Comrade Mao Zedong has always emphasized that Party members must transform their subjective world while transforming the objective world in the struggle to change the world. He emphasized that the Party should constantly carry out ideological struggles, continuously carry out ideological transformations, and use proletarian ideology to overcome all non-proletarian ideologies.

The editors of "Basic Knowledge," from their bourgeois standpoint, strenuously oppose emphasizing politics and opposing the ideological transformation of people. The entire book barely mentions the words "eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology" or "transform thoughts." The third section of the third lecture of "Basic Knowledge" abstractly discusses that Communist Party members must "maintain the purity of communist ideology" and "insist on the communist worldview and strive to build socialism," but it does not mention studying Chairman Mao's works or transforming thoughts, nor does it mention going to the three great revolutionary movements to temper and transform oneself. This is equivalent to saying that Communist Party members no longer need to continue ideological transformation. Obviously, this is completely contrary to Chairman Mao's thoughts on party building. How can one "maintain the purity of communist ideology" without carrying out ideological struggles within the Party, without using Mao Zedong Thought to overcome bourgeois ideology and revisionist ideology, and without going to the three great revolutionary movements to temper and transform oneself? Chairman Mao said: "Different thoughts and struggles within the Party are constantly occurring. This is a reflection of the class contradictions and the contradictions between new and old things within the Party. If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve contradictions within the Party, the life of the Party will also stop." Especially at a time when the class struggle in the ideological realm is extremely sharp and intense, if we do not emphasize politics, do not emphasize the elimination of bourgeois ideology, and do not use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, we will not be able to stand firm in the great waves of class struggle, distinguish the direction, and persist in revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly taught us that politics is the commander, the soul, and the lifeline of all economic work. "Without correct political views, it is equivalent to having no soul." However, this "Basic Knowledge" openly opposes Chairman Mao's teachings, strenuously propagating the bourgeois view of pure professionalism. When answering the question of how Party members can set an example in their work in the fourteenth lecture, they propose "two basic conditions": one is to have "advanced thoughts," and the other is to "be familiar with one's own profession and proficient in one's own business." They do not mention arming Party members' minds with Mao Zedong Thought or the ideological transformation of people, but abstractly discuss "advanced thoughts," and do not distinguish between the main and secondary aspects, listing the so-called "advanced thoughts" and "familiarity with technology" and "proficiency in business" as two equally important "basic conditions." In reality, their so-called "advanced thoughts" are also just a cover, aiming to emphasize professional technology. They attempt to lead our Party members, cadres, and youth to the wrong path of burying themselves in their work and detaching from politics, creating conditions for them to restore capitalism.

Around 1961, anti-Party elements, adapting to the needs of domestic and foreign class enemies, took the opportunity to rise up and launch a rampant attack on the Party and socialism. "Basic Knowledge" also raised the black flag of the "Frontline" manifesto, claiming to be "dialectical materialists," and fiercely attacking and slandering the leadership of our Party, opposing the general line, opposing the Great Leap Forward, and opposing the people's communes.

The combination of theory and practice, starting from reality, conducting investigations and research, and following the mass line is the consistent excellent style of our Party. The lines, policies, and principles of our Party are all formulated under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, based on the objective laws of social development and the fundamental interests of the vast majority of the people. However, when discussing issues such as the Party's guiding ideology, the Party's highest ideals, and the tasks of the current stage, this "Basic Knowledge" attacks our Party for not starting from reality, "acting solely on subjective wishes," "not understanding the importance of respecting objective reality," and "replacing policy with personal opinions"; it slanders our Party for "using communist standards to demand everything from the masses, thereby confusing the boundaries between Communist Party members and non-Party masses, and between the highest ideals and the policies formulated to achieve current tasks." They attempt to label our Party's leadership with the hats of "subjectivism" and "idealism." This is the most vicious attack and slander on our great Party, on the general line of socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes.

Their words are in the same tune as the attacks on our Party's leadership in the "Frontline" manifesto, Deng Tuo's slanders on our Great Leap Forward, and Khrushchev's curses on our Great Leap Forward. Is this a mere coincidence?

The general line of our Party's socialist construction is a Marxist-Leninist line proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong based on the experience of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Under the guidance of this general line, our country has achieved great victories on all fronts of socialist construction. Isn't this the most magnificent reality in history? Isn't this the objective existence of someone's subjective fabrication? However, the authors of this "Basic Knowledge" deliberately close their eyes to the facts and insist on cursing. In fact, such actions do not harm our great Party at all but fully expose the ugly faces of the revisionist elements of the former Beijing Municipal Committee who hate the Party and the three red banners.

When discussing issues such as the Party's democratic centralism, the Party's criticism and self-criticism, and the duties and rights of Party members, they also use a large number of vicious words to attack and slander the Party's leadership as "arrogant and self-righteous," "unwilling to listen to others' criticisms," and when criticizing others, they are "not objective and reasonable, not persuasive with reason, but instead, they do not observe boundaries, arbitrarily label 'hats,' do not adopt an analytical attitude towards problems, but are simple and brutal, denying everything, even 'killing with one blow.'" Look, their words are exactly the same as Wu Han's slanders on our Party's leadership in "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and Deng Tuo's slanders on our Party's leadership in "Night Talks on Yan Mountain" as "self-righteous and rejecting criticism" and "self-smart and looking down on the masses." Isn't this exactly the same reactionary tune?

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have always attached great importance to promoting democracy within the Party and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Our Party has always regarded promoting democracy within the Party as a necessary step to consolidate and develop the Party; it is an important weapon for uniting the whole Party and the people of the whole country, overcoming difficulties, and defeating the enemy. Chairman Mao said: "Within the Party, outside the Party, we should greatly advocate a democratic style. As long as it is not an enemy, as long as it is not malicious attack, everyone is allowed to speak, and it doesn't matter if they speak wrongly." He also emphasized that we should listen to good words, bad words, correct words, and wrong words. However, we must also remember what Chairman Mao taught us: first, we must distinguish between enemies and ourselves. Our democracy is only for the people, not for the reactionaries. For those who, like them, use the pretext of "promoting democracy" and "carrying out criticism" to attack the Party, we must make them behave properly and not allow them to speak or act recklessly.

Chairman Mao taught us: "If you want revolution, you must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party established according to the revolutionary theory and style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." This is one of the most important experiences of our Party over the past few decades and is also one of the most important experiences of the international communist movement. Especially today, when there is still extremely sharp and complex class struggle both domestically and internationally, without a proletarian revolutionary party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, it is impossible to lead the people of the whole country to carry out great revolutionary struggles, to achieve the thorough victory of the socialist revolution, and to complete the great historical task of the world proletarian revolution. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better implement Comrade Mao Zedong's party-building line and theory, and thoroughly and completely expel all bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party and are opposed to the Party and socialism, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    一个修正主义的建党纲领
    ——评前北京市委宣传部编写的《党的基本知识讲话》
    洪海声
    编者按：前北京市委宣传部编写的《党的基本知识讲话》，是一株宣扬修正主义建党思想的大毒草。他们披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，以讲授“党的基本知识”为名，妄图否认毛泽东思想是我党的唯一的指导思想。他们借口说我们党现阶段的基本任务是“建设社会主义”，妄图取消阶级斗争，取消无产阶级专政，宣扬现代修正主义的阶级调和论。他们竭尽污蔑之能事，攻击以毛主席为首的党中央的正确领导，攻击党的三面红旗。
    《党的基本知识讲话》，是前北京市委修正主义路线的产物，是为他们反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶目的服务的。前北京市委的修正主义老爷们，把这本书视为至宝，大量发行，到处推销。它已经起了十分有害的作用。对于这株大毒草，必须彻底批判，彻底铲除，彻底肃清它的恶劣影响。
    我们在建党的教育中，一定要以毛泽东思想为指针，以毛主席著作为教材。我们一定要认真学习毛主席的建党理论，学习毛主席关于共产党员的论述。在建党教育这个阵地上，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决反对资产阶级思想、修正主义思想以及其他一切形形色色的非无产阶级思想。
    前北京市委宣传部编写的《党的基本知识讲话》（以下简称《基本知识》），竭力抵制和反对毛泽东思想，歪曲和篡改毛泽东同志的建党路线和建党理论，公开地宣扬修正主义建党思想。
    从《基本知识》的内容和编辑出版时间可以看出，它完全是在前北京市委的《前线》发刊词这个修正主义总纲领的指导下，为了紧密配合反党黑帮在政治思想文化战线上向党猖狂进攻而编写的。它是一本对广大基层干部、党员和积极分子散布修正主义毒素的黑书。一九六一年一月吴晗的《海瑞罢官》“破门而出”，一九六一年三月和十月，邓拓、吴晗、廖沫沙的《燕山夜话》和《三家村札记》先后出笼。就在这个时候，这本《基本知识》也抛出来了。
    为了捍卫毛泽东思想，彻底粉碎一切资产阶级代表人物妄图改变我们党的面貌的罪恶阴谋，必须彻底揭露、彻底批判这个《基本知识》的修正主义反动本质，消除它所散布的毒素，肃清它的反动影响。
    一
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。对毛泽东思想采取什么态度，是承认还是抵制，是拥护还是反对，是热爱还是敌视，这是真革命和假革命，革命和反革命，马克思主义和修正主义的分水岭。
    一九六一年出版的《基本知识》，洋洋六万五千字，根本不讲毛泽东思想，甚至连学习毛主席著作都很少提到。这说明前北京市委修正主义分子抵制、敌视和反对毛泽东思想，已经到了何等猖狂的地步！由于几年来工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动广泛深入地发展，他们感到这样公开地反对毛泽东思想太露骨了，需要伪装一下。于是，一九六五年六月，他们对这个《基本知识》作了一些所谓的“修改”，加进了一些“毛泽东思想”和“学习毛主席著作”的话。可是，他们这样作，只能更加暴露他们反对毛泽东思想的真面目。
    这个《基本知识》的第一讲，是讲党的性质问题的，但只是空泛地讲中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先进部队，不讲我们党的无产阶级先锋队的性质到底是由什么决定的。我们的党，是毛泽东同志缔造和培育的党。是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党。我们的党，是理论和实际相结合的、和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的、有认真的自我批评精神的无产阶级先锋队。我们的党，是经历了历史上最激烈、最艰苦、最长期、最复杂的斗争的无产阶级革命党。我们党在全国人民和全世界人民中，享有极高的威信。毛泽东同志是我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手。可是，这本号称讲党的基本知识的讲话，却完全不去讲这些对我们党的无产阶级革命性质有决定意义的东西。很清楚，他们的目的，就是要抽掉我们党的灵魂——毛泽东思想，在广大党员和人民群众中模糊我们党的面貌，妄想否认毛泽东思想对我们党的无产阶级革命性质的伟大决定作用，否认我们党是伟大的、光荣的和正确的党。
    这个《基本知识》的第二讲，是讲党的指导思想的。谁都知道，我们党的指导思想，是毛泽东思想。早在一九四五年党的第七次全国代表大会所通过的党章的总纲中，就明确规定以毛泽东思想作为我们党的一切工作的指针。经过几十年来中国民主革命、社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实践检验，经过国际范围内反对美帝国主义、反对现代修正主义和各国反动派的伟大斗争的检验，都证明了毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，是我们党的唯一正确的指导思想。但是，他们在这一讲里却用了大部分篇幅，抽象地去讲什么叫马克思列宁主义，别有用心地大讲被他们歪曲和篡改了的所谓“辩证唯物主义”，就是不讲毛泽东思想是我们党的指导思想。他们只是含糊其词地讲了一句“运用马克思列宁主义的原理，灵活地、创造性地解决中国革命的实际问题，是我们党的一贯的思想原则。”这就证明，他们存心否认毛泽东思想是我们党的指导思想。
    这个《基本知识》在讲党的最高理想和现阶段任务以及其它许多重要问题时，也不讲毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想在这个《基本知识》里，完全处于可有可无的地位，成了他们最大的忌讳，这充分暴露了他们顽强地抵制、敌视和反对毛泽东思想的资产阶级反动立场。
    这个《基本知识》根本反对活学活用毛主席著作。就是在一九六五年六月修改，一九六六年三月第九次印刷的版本里，也连一句活学活用毛主席著作的话都找不到。理论联系实际，是我们党的优良的传统学风。一九六○年，林彪同志号召解放军全体指战员一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。一九六一年一月，林彪同志根据毛主席理论联系实际的思想，提出了“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”的原则。近几年来，党中央和军委、林彪同志又反复强调，一定要突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫，要把毛主席的书作为我们一切工作的指导方针。可是，这个《基本知识》却同党中央和林彪同志的号召唱反调，根本不提活学活用毛主席著作。其原因不是别的，就是因为《基本知识》的编者以及他们的后台老板，从反动的剥削阶级的本能出发，害怕毛泽东思想，害怕毛泽东思想同广大工农兵群众相结合。
    二
    承认不承认阶级斗争，坚持不坚持无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，历来是马克思列宁主义同一切修正主义的分界线。
    《基本知识》忠实地推行前北京市委的修正主义路线，竭力反对毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争的学说，根本否认无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，否认无产阶级专政。
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中强调指出：在我国，在所有制方面的社会主义改造基本完成以后，“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”
    可是，这个《基本知识》在讲到我们党的最高理想和现阶段的任务时，却说，我们党现阶段的任务，只是“建设社会主义”。它强调“在现阶段，我国人民的根本利益，是力求尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。”总之，是只讲建设，不讲阶级斗争；只讲现代化，不讲革命化。毛主席所指示的三大革命运动的灵魂——阶级斗争，在这里完全被他们阉割掉了。这是道道地地的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。试问，不搞阶级斗争，不搞革命，怎么建设社会主义？怎么实现我们党的最高理想共产主义？
    特别是在一九六二年党的八届十中全会以后，毛主席反复教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。对毛主席的这个极端重要的指示，前北京市委竭力抵制和反对。在他们一九六五年六月修改再版的《基本知识》里，除了做贼心虚地加了几句“社会主义革命”和“阶级斗争、两条道路斗争”的话，借以粉饰他们的反动面目之外，并没有作任何重大的原则性的修改，而是继续宣扬他们那一套“阶级斗争熄灭论”。
    这个《基本知识》不但否认国内的阶级斗争，还否认国际上的阶级斗争。在一九六一年的版本上，全书没有一句话提到反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义。在一九六五年六月的修改本上，因迫于形势，不得不在第三讲里加了一句“坚决反对美帝国主义”的口号。但是对于反对现代修正主义的问题，仍然一字不提。他们不仅不提反对现代修正主义，还别有用心地提出了一个“坚决维护社会主义阵营的团结”的口号。他们究竟要我们和谁去“维护团结”呢？我们党历来坚持“社会主义国家和世界共产主义运动一定要在马克思列宁主义的基础上巩固地团结起来”。他们却偏偏抽掉其中“在马克思列宁主义基础上团结”这样一个根本前提，无原则地大叫“团结”。这不是明明反对我们党进行反对修正主义的斗争吗？很明显，他们已经完全和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者站到一起去了！
    这个《基本知识》根本不讲无产阶级专政。大家都知道，革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级和资产阶级在意识形态领域内的阶级斗争，归根到底，就是争夺领导权的斗争。当前我国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，就是为了粉碎资产阶级代表人物复辟资本主义的阴谋，保卫无产阶级专政。这个《基本知识》不讲阶级斗争，不讲无产阶级专政，其目的就是要我们忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，以便他们为所欲为，大搞其复辟资本主义的活动。
    三
    毛泽东同志一贯强调突出政治，强调从政治思想上建党。他指出，“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”毛泽东同志一直强调党员要在改造客观世界的斗争中改造自己的主观世界。强调党内要经常开展思想斗争，不断进行思想改造，用无产阶级思想去战胜一切非无产阶级思想。
    《基本知识》的编者，从他们的资产阶级立场出发，竭力反对突出政治、反对人的思想革命化。全书连灭资兴无、改造思想的字句都很难找到。《基本知识》的第三讲第三节，抽象地空谈共产党员必须“保持共产主义思想的纯洁性”，“坚持共产主义世界观，为建成社会主义而奋斗”，却根本不讲学习毛主席著作、改造思想，不讲要到三大革命运动中去经受锻炼和改造。这就等于说，共产党员不需要再继续进行思想改造了。显然这是完全违背毛主席的建党思想的。试问，不开展党内思想斗争，不用毛泽东思想去克服资产阶级思想和修正主义思想，不到三大革命运动中去锻炼改造，怎么去“保持共产主义思想的纯洁性”？毛主席说：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”特别是在当前意识形态领域内的阶级斗争十分尖锐、十分激烈的时候，如果不突出政治，不强调灭资兴无，不用毛泽东思想去武装头脑，那就不可能在阶级斗争的大风浪中站稳脚跟，明辨方向，坚持革命。
    毛泽东同志一再教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线，“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”可是，这个《基本知识》公然同毛主席的教导相对抗，极力宣扬资产阶级单纯业务观点。他们在第十四讲回答党员“怎样才能在工作中起模范作用”的问题时，提出“必须具备两个基本条件”，一是要“思想先进”，一是要“熟悉本门技术，精通本门业务”。他们不讲用毛泽东思想武装党员的头脑，不讲人的思想革命化，而是抽象地讲“思想先进”，并且不分主次地把所谓“思想先进”和“熟悉技术”、“精通业务”作为两个同等重要的“基本条件”，并列起来。实际上，他们所谓的“思想先进”，也仅仅是一个幌子，目的还是在于强调业务技术。他们企图把我们的党员、干部和青年引导到埋头业务、脱离政治的邪路上去，为他们复辟资本主义创造条件。

    一九六一年前后，反党分子适应国内外阶级敌人的需要，乘机而起，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻。《基本知识》也打起《前线》发刊词这面黑旗，以“辩证唯物主义者”自居，大肆攻击和污蔑我们党的领导，反对总路线、反对大跃进、反对人民公社。
    理论和实践相结合，从实际出发，调查研究，走群众路线，是我们党的一贯的优良作风。我们党的路线、方针、政策都是在毛泽东思想指导下，根据社会发展的客观规律和最大多数人民群众的根本利益制定的。但是，这个《基本知识》在讲党的指导思想、党的最高理想和现阶段的任务等问题时，却攻击我们党不从实际出发，“单凭主观愿望办事”，“不懂得尊重客观实际的重要性”，“以感想代替政策”；污蔑我们党“用共产主义标准来要求一切群众，以致把最高理想和为实现当前任务所制定的政策，把共产党员和非党群众的界限混淆起来”。他们企图给我们党的领导扣上一顶
  “主观主义”、“唯心主义”的帽子。这是对我们伟大的党、对社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社的最恶毒的攻击和污蔑。
    他们的这些话，和《前线》发刊词对我们党的领导的攻击，和邓拓对我们大跃进的污蔑，和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者对我们大跃进的诅咒，完全是一个腔调。这难道能是偶然的巧合吗？
    党的社会主义建设总路线，是毛泽东同志总结了我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验而提出的一条马克思列宁主义的路线。在这条总路线的指引下，我国在社会主义建设的各个战线上取得了伟大的胜利。难道这不是史无前例的最伟大的现实吗？难道这是什么人的主观臆造而不是实实在在的客观存在吗？可是，这个《基本知识》的作者偏偏闭眼不看事实，硬要在那里大骂。其实，这种做法丝毫无损于我们伟大的党，倒是充分暴露了前北京市委修正主义分子仇恨党、仇恨三面红旗的丑恶面目。
    他们在讲党的民主集中制、党的批评和自我批评，以及党员的义务和权利等问题时，也使用了大量恶毒的字眼，攻击和污蔑党的领导“骄傲自大，自以为是”，“不愿意倾听别人的批评”，而“在批评别人时”，又“不是实事求是，以理服人，而是不讲分寸，乱扣‘帽子’，不是对问题采取分析态度，而是简单粗暴，否定一切，甚至‘一棍子打死’。”看，他们的这些话，同吴晗在《海瑞骂皇帝》中污蔑我们党的领导“自以为是，拒绝批评”，同邓拓在《燕山夜话》中污蔑我们党的领导“自作聪明，看不起群众”的反动腔调，岂不是完全一模一样的吗？
    毛主席和党中央历来都很重视发扬党内民主和开展批评与自我批评。我们党从来把发扬党内民主，看作是巩固党和发展党的必要步骤；是团结全党和全国人民，克服困难，战胜敌人的重要武器。毛主席说：“在党内，在党外，都大大地提倡民主作风。不论什么人，只要不是敌对分子，不是恶意攻击，允许大家讲话，讲错了也不要紧。”并且强调，好话，坏话，正确的话，错误的话都要听。但是，我们也一定要记住毛主席所教导的：首先要区分敌我，我们的民主，只给人民，不给反动派。对于像他们这样的假借“发扬民主”，“开展批评”，向党进攻的敌对分子，那就只能叫他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。
                  ＊　＊　＊
    毛主席教导我们：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”这是我们党几十年来的一个最重要的经验，也是国际共产主义运动的一个最重要的经验。特别是在今天，国内外还存在着极为尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，没有一个
  用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命党，就不可能领导全国人民进行伟大的革命斗争，就不可能取得社会主义革命的彻底胜利，就不可能完成无产阶级世界革命的伟大历史任务。我们必须更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更好地贯彻毛泽东同志的建党路线和建党理论，把钻进党内来的一切反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物，坚决彻底全部清除出去，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
