During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our country's social landscape is undergoing tremendous changes, with numerous new phenomena and new scenes emerging.

On the tram, Red Guards recite Chairman Mao's quotations. In the countryside, elderly women replace old posters on their doors with Chairman Mao's quotations. These occurrences hold great significance!

Currently, tens of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary students are eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works. They carry the radiant quotations of Chairman Mao with them, write them on walls, recite them aloud, memorize them in their hearts, and put them into action. The widespread grasp of revolutionary truth by the masses is unprecedented in history.

Frequently reading and applying Chairman Mao's quotations in practice is a new phenomenon of revolutionization. This is a sign of our country's increasing prosperity and a manifestation of our people's resolve and enthusiasm for overthrowing the bourgeoisie and establishing communism. Studying Chairman Mao's works has become the primary need in the lives of our people. We must enthusiastically welcome such new phenomena and new scenes!

Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism that transforms people's souls and is the strongest ideological weapon of the proletariat. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to promote the ideological revolutionization of the entire nation. Only by using Mao Zedong Thought to promote the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses can we ensure that our revolutionary cause continues to advance and that the proletarian revolutionary state remains unshakable.

Mao Zedong Thought is our sunlight, rain, air, and food. We love, worship, and believe in Mao Zedong Thought without limit. We never forget to study Chairman Mao's works. We must always remember Chairman Mao's words. We must let the great leader's teachings illuminate our path forward at all times. A driver said, "Without reading the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' it's like driving without a steering wheel." This is truly well said. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can always move forward in the correct direction and achieve victory.

Studying, propagating, implementing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought is the lifelong combat mission of every revolutionary. We must diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learning at all times and in all places. "Carry the quotations with you and study them whenever you have time," and apply what you learn. Let the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate every aspect of our lives. Wherever Mao Zedong Thought shines, there is light. With this unified and correct thought, the people of the entire nation will be armed. In this way, the Chinese Revolution and the world revolution will definitely be victorious, and all exploiting classes in our country will never be able to rise again.

Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts. With the sun shining brightly, all things flourish. Under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, let the new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat flourish vigorously on the land of our great motherland!

    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国社会面貌正发生着巨大变化，出现了许许多多新事物、新气象。
    电车上，红卫兵小将读毛主席语录。农村里，老大娘在原先贴旧贴子的门上换上毛主席语录。这些事情的出现，包含着伟大的意义！
    现在，千百万工农兵群众和革命学生，如饥似渴地学习毛主席的书。他们把红光闪闪的毛主席语录，带在身边，写在墙上，读在口里，记在心间，用到行动中。革命的真理这样广泛地被群众掌握，是史无前例的。
    经常读毛主席语录，活学活用毛主席著作，这是革命化的新气象。这是我国日益兴旺的标志，是我国人民灭资兴无的革命决心和革命热情的表现。学习毛主席著作已是我国人民生活的第一需要。我们要为这样的新事物、新气象热烈地欢呼！
    毛泽东思想是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。我们要用毛泽东思想来促进全国人民的思想革命化。只有用毛泽东思想促进广大人民思想革命化，才能保证我们革命事业永远向前发展，才能保证无产阶级革命江山永不变色。
    毛泽东思想是我们的阳光、雨露、空气和粮食。我们无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰毛泽东思想。我们念念不忘学习毛主席著作。我们时时刻刻要牢记毛主席的话。我们要让伟大领袖的教导时时刻刻照亮前进的道路。一位司机说：“不读《毛主席语录》，就好像开车没有方向盘。”说得真好，有了毛泽东思想，我们就能永远朝正确的方向胜利前进。
    学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，执行毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想，是我们每个革命者毕生的战斗任务。我们一定要认真活学活用毛主席著作，时时学，处处学。“语录随身带，有空学起来”，学了就用。让毛泽东思想的阳光照亮我们生活的每个领域。毛泽东思想照到哪里哪里亮。全国人民都以这个统一的思想、正确的思想武装起来，这样，中国革命和世界革命就一定能够胜利，一切剥削阶级在我国就永世不得翻身。
    毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳。阳光普照，万物生长。在毛泽东思想的照耀下，让无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，在我们伟大祖国的土地上蓬蓬勃勃地发展吧！
