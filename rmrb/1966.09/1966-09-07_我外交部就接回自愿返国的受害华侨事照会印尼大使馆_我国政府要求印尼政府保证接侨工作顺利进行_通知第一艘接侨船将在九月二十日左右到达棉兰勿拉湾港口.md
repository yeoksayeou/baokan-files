The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on September 5, notifying that the first Chinese ship to repatriate voluntary returning overseas Chinese victims will arrive at the port of Belawan in Medan around September 20. Given that the Indonesian government is frenziedly carrying out anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese activities, many overseas Chinese victims have lost their livelihoods and are in danger. To ensure the smooth repatriation of the victims, the Chinese government has made five demands to the Indonesian government.

The note said: On September 2, Mr. Marzuki, Deputy Director of the Asia-Pacific Division of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied to Mr. Yao Dengshan, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, that the Indonesian government agrees to allow Chinese ships to go to Medan and Banda Aceh to repatriate voluntary returning overseas Chinese victims.

The Chinese government had notified the Indonesian government as early as May 18 that it had decided to send ships to Indonesia to repatriate voluntary returning overseas Chinese victims. For several months, the Indonesian government has been delaying its response, causing the Chinese repatriation ships to be unable to set sail. Now, based on the above reply from the Indonesian government, the Chinese government has decided that the first Chinese repatriation ship will arrive at the port of Belawan in Medan around September 20, 1966. The ship can accommodate about 700 people.

The note said: Given that the Indonesian government is frenziedly carrying out anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese activities, many overseas Chinese victims have lost their livelihoods and are in danger. To ensure the smooth repatriation of the victims, the Chinese government makes the following demands:

	1. The Indonesian government must immediately stop persecuting overseas Chinese, release all detained overseas Chinese, and ensure the safety of their lives and property.
	2. Since there are many voluntary returning overseas Chinese victims spread across various regions of Indonesia, their repatriation must be carried out in phases and batches. The Chinese government will send ships to Jakarta, Surabaya, Makassar, and other relevant ports in Indonesia to repatriate voluntary returning overseas Chinese victims.
	3. The Indonesian government must ensure the safety of Chinese repatriation ships and their crew when entering and exiting Indonesian territorial waters and during their stay in the ports, and provide necessary assistance and convenience.
	4. The Chinese government sending ships to Indonesia to repatriate victims is a major matter concerning the relations between the two countries, which must be resolved through negotiations between representatives of the two governments. Chinese Consul-General Xu Ren, Consul Shi Jinkan, and Vice-Consul Qian Shuming will immediately go to Medan with necessary personnel to arrange the repatriation of the first batch of victims. The Chinese government demands that the Indonesian government ensure their safety and provide necessary convenience. The Chinese government also demands that the Indonesian government send officials to Medan to handle this matter together.
	5. The Indonesian government should ensure the safety of returning overseas Chinese on their way to the ports and during their stay in the ports, provide necessary convenience in transportation and living, simplify their exit procedures, and not obstruct them from bringing their belongings and funds back to China.

    我外交部就接回自愿返国的受害华侨事照会印尼大使馆
    我国政府要求印尼政府保证接侨工作顺利进行
    通知第一艘接侨船将在九月二十日左右到达棉兰勿拉湾港口
    新华社六日讯　中国外交部五日照会印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，通知第一艘中国接运自愿返国的受害华侨的船只将于九月二十日左右到达棉兰勿拉湾港口。鉴于印度尼西亚政府疯狂推行反华排华的活动，大批受害华侨生计已经断绝，安全失去保障，为了使接运受害华侨的工作能够顺利进行，中国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出了五项要求。
    照会说：九月二日，印度尼西亚外交部亚洲太平洋司副司长玛佐尼先生答复中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆临时代办姚登山先生，印度尼西亚政府同意中国政府派遣船只到棉兰和班达亚齐接运自愿返国的受害华侨。
    中国政府早在五月十八日就通知印度尼西亚政府，中国政府决定派船前往印度尼西亚接回自愿返国的受害华侨。几个月以来，印度尼西亚政府一直拖延不复，致使中国接侨船只迟迟不能启航。现在根据印度尼西亚政府的上述答复，中国政府决定，第一艘中国接侨船将于一九六六年九月二十日左右到达棉兰勿拉湾港口。该船可接运七百人左右。
    照会说：鉴于印度尼西亚政府疯狂推行反华排华的活动，大批受害华侨生计已经断绝，安全失去保障，为了使接运受害华侨的工作能够顺利进行，中国政府提出以下要求：
    一、印度尼西亚政府必须立即停止迫害华侨，释放全部被逮捕和拘禁的华侨，切实保障华侨生命财产的安全。
    二、由于自愿返国的受害华侨人数众多，遍布印度尼西亚各个地区，接运他们回国必须分期分批进行。中国政府将陆续派船前往雅加达、泗水、望加锡和印度尼西亚其它有关港口，接运自愿返国的受害华侨。
    三、印度尼西亚政府必须切实保证中国接侨船只及其船员在进出印度尼西亚领海和在港口期间的安全，并且提供必要的协助和方便。
    四、中国派船到印度尼西亚接运受害华侨回国，是涉及两国关系的重大事务，必须由两国政府的代表商谈解决。中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁，领事师晋侃、副领事邝叔明将偕同必要的工作人员立即前往棉兰，安排接运第一批受害华侨的工作。中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府，切实保证他们的安全和提供必要的方便。并且要求印度尼西亚政府，派遣官员前往棉兰，会同办理此项工作。
    五、印度尼西亚政府应保证返国华侨在前往港口途中和在港口期间的安全，在交通运输和生活方面给予必要的便利，简化他们离境的手续，并且不得阻挠他们携带自己的财物和资金回国。
