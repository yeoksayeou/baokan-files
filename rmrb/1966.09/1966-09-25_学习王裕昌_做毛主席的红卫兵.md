	Learn from Wang Yuchang and Be Chairman Mao's Red Guards

	The broad masses of Red Guards in Fujian and Chengdu have resolved to take Wang Yuchang as their example, to persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions at all times and in all places, and to be faithful servants of the people.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Fujian, September 24th — “Learn from Wang Yuchang, be Chairman Mao's little red soldiers!” This is the resounding slogan raised by the Red Guards in Fujian.

	The Red Guards from a middle school near the unit where Wang Yuchang is stationed have long known about Wang Yuchang's heroic deed of sacrificing himself to save others. Over the past few months, they have always taken Wang Yuchang's lofty communist morality as their living example to learn from. On their way home, the Red Guards helped workers push carts up hills; on the bus, they helped the elderly and children get on and off, and found them seats. When a strong typhoon struck, they braved the wind and rain to clear fallen trees from the roads, ensuring traffic flow. Some Red Guards, despite being soaked to the skin, rushed to the fields to help the commune members salvage waterlogged vegetables.

	After Wang Yuchang was injured and hospitalized, the Red Guards from the Eleventh Middle School in Fuzhou visited him in the hospital. They deeply felt that studying Chairman Mao's works well is the key to doing everything well, and Wang Yuchang's heroic deeds are the result of acting honestly according to Chairman Mao's teachings. From then on, they insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works every day, constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to examine and transform themselves.

	After Wang Yuchang's deeds were published in the newspapers, the Red Guards' enthusiasm for learning surged even higher. They held numerous discussion meetings. The Red Guards said: Wang Yuchang's repeated heroic deeds of sacrificing himself to save his class brothers are exemplary of loyalty to the Party and the people. We Red Guards must learn from this living example of the People's Liberation Army.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, September 24th — The broad masses of Red Guards in Chengdu are enthusiastically studying the heroic deeds of Wang Yuchang, Chairman Mao's good soldier and the People's Liberation Army's model of loving the soldiers. They unanimously expressed their determination to act honestly according to Chairman Mao's teachings, just like Wang Yuchang, and to be Red Guards in the style of Wang Yuchang.

	When reading about Wang Yuchang's deeds, studying his diary, or holding discussion meetings, many Red Guards from various colleges and universities were moved by his lofty communist morality. Some Red Guards from Chengdu Institute of Technology said that Wang Yuchang's brilliant deeds made us once again realize that soldiers armed with great Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts, the brightest eyes, the hardest bones, and the strongest fighting spirit. There are countless things to learn from Wang Yuchang, but the most important thing is to truly master Mao Zedong Thought like he did. Some Red Guards also used Wang Yuchang as a mirror to consciously examine their own study of Chairman Mao's works during the current Cultural Revolution.

	During the Cultural Revolution, many Red Guards from Sichuan Medical College learned from the People's Liberation Army, treating the study of Chairman Mao's works as their first priority in life. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, insisted on integrating with workers and peasants, and recently organized a labor army to rush into the countryside and help poor and lower-middle peasants harvest rice, earning the praise of being “Red Guards sent by Chairman Mao.” After learning from Wang Yuchang's heroic deeds, these Red Guards excitedly said, “We Red Guards are the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. We must act according to Chairman Mao's teachings at all times and in all places, insist on integrating with workers and peasants, learn from workers and peasants, and temper ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.”

    学习王裕昌  做毛主席的红卫兵
    福建、成都广大红卫兵决心以王裕昌为榜样，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，时时处处照毛主席的指示办事，做人民的忠实的勤务员
    据新华社福州二十四日电　“向王裕昌学习，当毛主席的红小兵！”这是福建的红卫兵提出的响亮口号。
    王裕昌所在部队驻地附近一所中学的红卫兵们，早就知道王裕昌舍身救人的英雄事迹。几个月来，他们一直以王裕昌崇高的共产主义品德作为自己学习的活榜样。在回家的路上，红卫兵们帮助工人推板车上坡；在公共汽车上，帮助老人、小孩上下车，安置坐位。强台风袭击时，他们冒着狂风暴雨，清除公路上被刮倒的树木，保证车辆通行。有些红卫兵不顾浑身淋得湿透，还跑到田间，帮助人民公社社员抢收被水淹的蔬菜。
    王裕昌受伤住院以后，福州市第十一中学的红卫兵，曾经到医院访问过他。他们体会最深的是：学好毛主席著作是搞好一切工作的关键，王裕昌的英雄行为就是老老实实按照毛主席的教导办事的结果。从此他们坚持天天学习毛主席著作，时时刻刻以毛泽东思想对照自己，改造自己。
  王裕昌的事迹在报纸上公布以后，红卫兵们的学习热情更高，他们纷纷举行座谈会。红卫兵们说：王裕昌同志再三舍身救阶级兄弟的英雄事迹，是忠于党、忠于人民的典范，我们红卫兵一定要向解放军的这个活榜样学习。
    据新华社成都二十四日电　成都市广大红卫兵热情学习毛主席的好战士、解放军爱兵模范王裕昌的英雄事迹，一致表示要像王裕昌那样老老实实地按照毛主席的教导办事，做一个王裕昌式的红卫兵。
    在阅读王裕昌的事迹，学习他的日记，或者举行座谈讨论的时候，不少大中学校的红卫兵都为他崇高的共产主义品德所感动。成都工学院一些红卫兵说，王裕昌的光辉事迹使我们再一次认识到，用伟大毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，心最红，眼最亮，骨头最硬，斗志最坚强。在王裕昌同志身上值得学习的有千条万条，但是最重要的一条就是要像他那样把毛泽东思想真正学到手。有的红卫兵还用王裕昌同志作镜子，自觉地检查了在当前文化大革命中学习毛主席著作的情况。
    在文化大革命中，四川医学院不少红卫兵大学解放军，像解放军那样把学习毛主席著作当作生活第一需要。他们遵循毛主席的教导，坚持和工农结合，最近曾组织了一支劳动大军，深入农村，和贫农下中农一起抢收水稻，被誉为“毛主席派来的红卫兵”。这些红卫兵在学习王裕昌的英雄事迹后兴奋地说，我们红卫兵是解放军的后备军，一定要像王裕昌那样，时时处处按照毛主席的教导办事，坚持同工农结合，向工农学习，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
