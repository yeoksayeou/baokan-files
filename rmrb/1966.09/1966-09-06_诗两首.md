	Two Poems
	Head of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association Delegation, Sun Guangfa

	In Commemoration of the 21st Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (a hundred-character poem)

	Vietnam and China, two brotherly nations,
	The people are brave and courageous.
	History is glorious, today we resist America.
	The frontline and the rear are well-prepared,
	The frontline is stronger than ever.
	The American aggressors will surely meet defeat,
	Justice will prevail over injustice.
	The East Wind prevails over the West Wind.
	Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh and China's Mao Zedong,
	Two great leaders with radiant light.
	Under their leadership, the people will charge forward,
	Production and victory will be achieved.
	In the fight against America, great success will be achieved.

	Reflections on Visiting the Sandstone Ridge Production Team

	Nuwa mended the sky with stones,
	The little bird carried pebbles to fill the sea.
	At Sandstone Ridge, we learn from Chairman Mao,
	We can fight and overcome natural disasters.
	If there is water in the sky, we have water,
	If there is earth below, we have earth.
	Ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million loads,
	We do not fear hard work.
	Now, all the grains are abundant,
	Pears and grapes cover the mountains and fields.
	Every family's production is increasing,
	We are not afraid of the sky or the earth.
	We are truly happy to visit,
	The brotherly nation is becoming richer and stronger every day.
	The struggle against America will surely be victorious,
	With a great rear.

    诗两首
    越中友协代表团团长　孙光阀
    纪念越南民主共和国国庆二十一周年（百字诗）越南与中国　两个兄弟邦人民很英勇　历史最辉煌今日在抗美　前线和后方后方好准备　前线益坚强美国侵略者　难免遭败亡正义胜非义　东风压西风越南胡志明　中国毛泽东两伟大领袖　光芒万丈红在他领导下　全民会冲锋生产新胜利　抗美大成功参观沙石峪生产队有感女娲炼石天莫补　精卫衔石海难填沙石峪学毛主席　更能战斗胜天然天上有水它有水　地下有土它有土十担百担千万担　劳动从不怕艰苦如今五谷都丰收　苹梨葡萄遍山野家家生产日益增　天不怕来地不怕我们来访真高兴　友邦日日增富强抗美斗争一定胜　以有伟大的后方
