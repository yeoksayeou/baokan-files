Workers at the Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant have studied Chairman Mao's works, forged their own path in industrial development, and successfully developed the Huanghe-brand seven-ton three-sided self-dumping truck. This self-dumping truck can unload to the left, right, and rear, with the unloading process taking only nine to twelve seconds. The maximum dumping angle of the truck bed can reach fifty degrees, making it an advanced tool for transporting bulk materials on construction sites and in factory enterprises.

    济南制成三面自卸汽车
    济南汽车制造总厂的职工，大学毛主席著作，走自己工业发展的道路，试制成功黄河牌七吨载重三面自卸汽车。这种自卸车可向左、右、后三个方向倾卸，举升卸货过程仅需九至十二秒钟时间，车厢最大倾卸角可达五十度，是建筑工地及工厂企业运输散装物资的先进工具。
