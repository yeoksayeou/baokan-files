The Vietnamese People's Daily on September 18th published a commentary strongly condemning the U.S. aggressor planes' brazen intrusion into the airspace of Dongxing, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous County on September 9th, and their savage strafing of Chinese villages and commune members at work. The commentary pointed out, "U.S. imperialism's adoption of this new war provocation against the 700 million people of China is a serious step forward in its provocations against the People's Republic of China."

The commentary said, "U.S. imperialism's frenzied opposition to China is because China resolutely opposes U.S.-led imperialism and firmly supports the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. U.S. imperialism thinks that by intensifying its policy of attack, provocation, and war blackmail, it can intimidate the Chinese people. This is an extremely foolish delusion."

The commentary said, "The Vietnamese people resolutely condemn U.S. imperialism's provocative behavior against China on September 9th. We fully support the Chinese government and people's stance in the severe warning issued by the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense on September 16, 1966, against U.S. imperialism. Our people, with the determination to defeat the U.S. aggressors, stand shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people in the struggle against our common enemy and will definitely bury the aggressive and warlike U.S. imperialism."

The New Vietnam-China Daily on September 18th also published a commentary emphasizing, "The 700 million people of China, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, are invincible. If the U.S. does not stop its war provocations against the Chinese people, even greater and more disastrous defeats await it on the battlefield in Vietnam. The 700 million people of China will thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate the U.S. aggressors."

The commentary said, "U.S. imperialism may shake the mountains, but it cannot shake the Chinese people's resolve to aid Vietnam and resist U.S. aggression. No matter how frenzied U.S. imperialism becomes, no matter what tricks it plays, it cannot shake the 700 million Chinese people's resolve to support the Vietnamese people to the end. On the contrary, U.S. imperialism's criminal war provocations will only arouse greater anger among the Chinese people, raise the red flag of Mao Zedong thought even higher, and more resolutely support the Vietnamese people in defeating the U.S. aggressors."

The New China News Agency, Hanoi, September 18th: The Albanian newspaper Unity on September 18th published a commentary severely condemning the U.S. imperialist warplanes' intrusion into Chinese airspace and their savage strafing of Chinese civilians on September 9th, expressing deep indignation. The commentary pointed out that U.S. imperialism's war provocations against the great 700 million people of China are entirely premeditated and part of the overall plan of U.S. imperialism to expand the war in Southeast Asia.

The commentary pointed out that U.S. imperialism thinks that by provoking war against China, it can intimidate the peoples of Southeast Asian countries and make China abandon its policy of firmly supporting the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Southeast Asian countries, thereby allowing U.S. imperialism to run rampant in Southeast Asia. This is entirely a miscalculation. Neither the Chinese people nor the peoples of Southeast Asia will be intimidated by the threats of the U.S. aggressors.

    越中人民并肩战斗一定把美帝埋葬
    阿《团结报》说美帝企图迫使中国放弃援越抗美政策是打错了算盘
    新华社河内十八日电  越南《人民报》十八日发表评论，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机九日上午悍然侵入中国广西东兴各族自治县上空，疯狂扫射中国村庄和正在劳动的公社社员的战争挑衅行动。
    评论指出，“美帝国主义采取这一反对七亿中国人民的新战争行动，是它在对中华人民共和国进行挑衅的道路上又踏出了严重的一步。”
    评论说，“美帝国主义疯狂地反对中国，是因为中国坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义和坚决支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。美帝国主义以为，加强袭击、挑衅和战争讹诈政策，就可以威胁中国人民。这是极端愚蠢的幻想。”
    评论说，“越南人民坚决谴责美帝国主义九月九日对中国的挑衅行为。我们彻底支持中国政府和人民在中国国防部发言人一九六六年九月十六日声明中严厉警告美帝国主义的立场。我国人民怀着战胜美国侵略强盗的决心，同兄弟的中国人民并肩进行反对共同敌人的斗争，一定要把侵略成性和好战的美帝国主义埋葬掉。”
    《新越华报》十八日也发表评论强调指出，“用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不可侮的。美国如果不停止对中国人民的战争挑衅，比越南战场上更大的、更惨重的失败正在等待它们。七亿中国人民必将把美国侵略者彻底、干净、全部的消灭掉。”
    评论说，“美帝国主义撼山易，要撼中国人民援越抗美的决心是办不到的。不管美帝国主义疯狂到什么地步，不管它还要耍什么花招，都绝不能动摇七亿中国人民支援越南人民打到底的决心。相反的，美帝国主义这种罪恶的战争挑衅行动，只会激起中国人民的更大愤怒，更高地举起毛泽东思想红旗，更加坚决地支援越南人民打败美国侵略者。”
    新华社地拉那十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十八日发表评论，严厉谴责美帝国主义战斗机九日侵犯中国领空，疯狂扫射中国公民的严重的战争挑衅行为，并表示深刻的愤怒。评论指出，美帝国主义对伟大的七亿中国人民的战争挑衅完全是预谋的，是美帝国主义企图在东南亚扩大战争的总计划的组成部分。
    评论指出，美帝国主义以为对中国进行战争挑衅，就会吓倒东南亚各国人民，就会使中国放弃坚决支持越南人民和东南亚各国人民的政策，从而使美帝国主义能够腾出手来对东南亚各国人民为所欲为，这完全是打错了算盘。不管是中国人民，还是东南亚各国人民都绝不会被美国强盗的威胁所吓倒。
