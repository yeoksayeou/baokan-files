The People's Republic of China's representative, Ambassador Wang Guoqian, held a press conference after the 13th round of Sino-American ambassadorial talks and issued the following statement:

Recently, the U.S. government has repeatedly violated the agreements between China and the U.S., unilaterally disclosing the contents of the Sino-American ambassadorial talks. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has followed suit, propagating "Sino-American dialogue." They sing in unison, engaging in deceptive propaganda, attempting to create an atmosphere of Sino-American rapprochement, to cover up the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression and war, and to obscure the high banner of anti-Americanism held by the Chinese people. Now, I am authorized to release my main speech from today's 13th Sino-American talks. All honest people in the world will surely be able to see clearly from it the serious stance taken by the Chinese government in the Sino-American talks. The U.S. government's deceptive propaganda and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique's nonsense can only further expose their own treacherous faces.

	Newspaper report from Warsaw, September 7th: The 13th round of Sino-American ambassadorial talks was held this afternoon at 2 PM in Warsaw. The meeting lasted three hours. Both sides agreed to hold the next meeting on January 11th, 1967, at 2 PM.

	After the meeting, the People's Republic of China's representative, Ambassador Wang Guoqian, held a press conference at the venue and issued a statement, distributing a copy of his main speech from this meeting.

    全世界都看到中国人民始终高举着反美旗帜
    美苏合伙搞欺骗宣传更加暴露它们狼狈为奸
    新华社华沙七日电　中美大使级会谈第一三一次会议七日下午两点在华沙举行。这次会议历时三小时。双方同意下次会议定于一九六七年一月十一日下午二时举行。
    会后，中华人民共和国代表、中国驻波兰大使王国权在会场举行了记者招待会，发表了声明并散发了他在这次会议上的主要发言稿。
    新华社华沙七日电　中华人民共和国代表王国权大使七日在第一三一次中美大使级会谈后举行记者招待会，在会上发表了如下声明：
    最近，美国政府一再违犯中美双方协议，片面透露中美大使级会谈的内容。苏联修正主义领导集团随之大肆宣传“中美对话”。它们一唱一和，进行欺骗宣传，妄图制造中美和解空气，为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策打掩护，模糊中国人民高高举起的反美旗帜。现在，我奉命公布我在今天举行的第一三一次中美会谈中的主要发言。全世界一切正直的人们，必定能够从中清楚地看到中国政府在中美会谈中所采取的严正立场。美国政府进行欺骗宣传，苏联修正主义领导集团发表连篇鬼话，只能进一步暴露它们自己的奸险面目。
