The pastoral areas of Wulan County are sparsely populated and have poor transportation. Under these circumstances, running a party school is quite difficult. The Wulan County Committee of Qinghai Province has taken this issue seriously. Since last September, they have followed the example of the "Ulan Pastoral Troupe" and implemented a mobile party school, achieving good results.

This mobile party school uses the works of Chairman Mao as the basic teaching materials and conducts training through meetings. Each study session helps every comrade solve one or two ideological issues. The sessions are short but effective, making it easy to sustain long-term efforts, and they are well-received by party members and the masses. Party members say, "The party truly cares for us, bringing the party school to our doorstep." The mobile party school is particularly popular among female party members, who say, "With the party school at our doorstep, we no longer worry about household chores and children."

Practice has shown that this "Ulan Pastoral Troupe" style mobile party school has many advantages:

The mobile party school comes to the doorsteps of party members, which is beneficial for linking theory with practice, for production and work, and for the majority of party members to participate. In the past, when the party school was held in the county, most participants were branch secretaries, branch committee members, or other cadre party members. Very few ordinary party members participated, especially female party members, more than 90% of whom had never studied. By bringing the party school to the grassroots, opportunities for learning are created. Holding the party school at the grassroots level also allows for work and study to go hand in hand. Party members can study during the day and return home in the evening to take care of livestock and handle household chores. They can also use the evening time to propagate party policies to community members or assign work.

The mobile party school among the masses helps to overcome "bookishness." They start from reality, based on the specific conditions of the locality and the active thoughts of the students, to formulate teaching plans, achieving a unity of learning and application, with immediate effects. Before each mobile party school session, the party school teachers spend half a month to twenty days conducting investigations and research among the masses, first grasping the actual situation of the locality and the active thoughts of the party members, and then "prescribing the right medicine" to formulate teaching plans. Therefore, the lectures are targeted and effective.

In the mobile party school, township and commune cadres and party members study together, which facilitates mutual learning and supervision, and is more conducive to consolidating learning outcomes. Party members from the same township or commune study together, checking what they have inspected, what help comrades have provided, what attitudes and resolutions they have expressed, all of which are heard and remembered by everyone. After studying, it is also clear whether they act according to their resolutions in work and production.

Running a mobile party school allows teachers to frequently stay with the masses, eating, living, and working together. This is beneficial for the ideological transformation of teachers, for investigation and research, and can improve teaching quality.

Running a mobile party school costs less money and achieves more than running a party school in the county. Many party members happily say, "In the past, studying at the party school cost the public a lot of money, and we also spent money; now the party school comes to our doorstep, the public spends less money, and we spend no money."

    乌兰县的“乌兰牧骑”党校
    牧区居住分散，交通不便。在这种情况下，办党校就比较困难。青海省乌兰县委认真对待这个问题，从去年九月以来，以“乌兰牧骑”为榜样，实行流动办党校，收到了良好的效果。
    这种流动党校以毛主席著作为基本教材，以开会的形式搞训练。每次学习，使每个同志都能真正解决一两个思想问题。时间短，收效大，便于长期坚持，很受党员群众欢迎。党员们说：“党对我们真关心，把党校搬到我们家门口来了。”流动党校特别受女党员欢迎，她们说：“党校办到家门口，再不愁家务和孩子拖累了。”
    实践证明，这种“乌兰牧骑”式的流动党校，有许多好处：
    流动党校办到党员家门口，有利于理论联系实际，有利于生产和工作，有利于大多数党员参加。过去在县上办党校，参加学习的大都是支部书记、支部委员或其他干部党员，一般党员参加的很少，特别是女党员，百分之九十以上没有学习过。把党校搬下去办，就给他们创造了学习的机会。在下面办党校，还可以使工作学习两不误，党员们白天学习，晚上回家照料牲畜和忙家务，也可以利用晚上时间向社员宣传党的政策或布置工作。
    流动党校办到群众当中，就有利于克服“本本主义”。他们从实际出发，根据当地的具体情况和学员当中的活思想制定教学计划，做到学用一致，收到立竿见影之效。每期流动党校举办之前，党校教员都用半个月至二十天的时间在群众中做调查研究，先掌握当地的实际情况和党员的活思想，然后“对症下药”制定教学计划，因而使讲课做到了有的放矢。
    在流动党校中，乡社干部和党员都在一起，这就便于相互学习、相互监督，更有利于巩固学习成果。同一个乡社的党员，在一块学习，自己检查了些什么，同志们帮助了些什么，自己表示了什么态度和决心，大家都听在耳里，记在心里，学习以后，在工作和生产中是否按自己的决心去做，也看得很清楚。
    办流动党校，教员经常同群众在一起，同吃同住同劳动。这就有利于教员的思想改造，有利于调查研究，可以提高教学质量。
    办流动党校比在县上办党校，少花钱，多办事。许多党员高兴地说：“过去到党校学习，公家多花钱，我们也花钱；现在党校办到家门口，公家少花钱，我们不花钱。”
