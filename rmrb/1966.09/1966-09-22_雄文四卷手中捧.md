	Holding four volumes of magnificent works,
	Student Li Changfu
	When the spring thunder roars, the earth trembles,
	Four volumes of magnificent works shine red in the sky,
	The Yellow River boils, and the Yangtze River laughs,
	The Tian Mountains turn red, and the Kunlun Mountains turn green.
	Holding four volumes of magnificent works,
	I can't help but have tears of joy welling up,
	It's as if Chairman Mao is by my side,
	A red sun rises in my heart.
	Chairman Mao points the way with a wave of his hand,
	A rainbow of a million miles appears in the sky,
	Ten thousand people tread the colorful path,
	With heads held high, they sing "The East Is Red" loudly.

    雄文四卷手中捧
    学生　李长富
    春雷一唱大地动，
    雄文四卷映天红，
    黄河沸腾长江笑，
    天山红遍昆仑青。
    雄文四卷手中捧啊，
    不禁热泪满眶涌，
    好像主席在身边，
    一轮红日心底升。
    毛主席挥手指方向，
    长空万里起彩虹，
    万众踏着五彩路，
    昂首高歌《东方红》。
