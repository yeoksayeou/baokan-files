Recently, during the exhibition of Chinese artworks in Arad, Romania, the broad Romanian audience expressed their boundless love and admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They enthusiastically praised the works that embody Mao Zedong Thought.

"We love Mao Zedong!" "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Send our warm greetings to Mao Zedong!" Many viewers, upon seeing the works that depict Chairman Mao's brilliant image, expressed their heartfelt love for Chairman Mao to the Chinese comrades. An elderly teacher, upon seeing the portrait of Chairman Mao in the oil painting "On the Eve of the Decisive Battle," excitedly said, "Mao Zedong is as great as Lenin. He is the Lenin of our time. We love him." An elderly worker, while looking at the paintings, said, "Mao Zedong not only leads the Chinese people in revolution and construction but also leads the revolutionary people of the world in revolution." "Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He holds high the torch of the international communist movement, guiding the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world forward." "The Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong are the hope of the proletariat of the world." "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of Marxist-Leninists." A female nurse, upon reaching the portrait of Chairman Mao, raised her hand and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" She said, "Standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, I feel as if I have boundless strength. Mao Zedong is a great revolutionary teacher. He is as great as Lenin." She saw the propaganda poster "Chairman Mao's Works Are Like the Sun" and said, "The old farmer is so happy to read Chairman Mao's works, just as the sun illuminates his heart." When she learned that her understanding matched the title on the poster, she excitedly said, "This title exactly hits the mark." An office worker, in front of the painting "Long Live Chairman Mao," said, "Chairman Mao is a great teacher, a great leader, a great commander, and a great helmsman. This is absolutely true."

Many viewers, when talking about Chairman Mao's recent swim in the Yangtze River, excitedly said that Chairman Mao's health is not only the greatest happiness for the Chinese people but also the greatest happiness for the revolutionary people of the world.

Many viewers also shared their experiences of studying Chairman Mao's works. A middle school teacher, upon seeing the painting that reflects the Chinese people's study of Chairman Mao's works, said, "I am also studying Mao Zedong's works. Comrade Mao Zedong's words are so good. Comrade Mao Zedong is a very, very wise leader." Three cadres working in a farm said that they are also reading Comrade Mao Zedong's works and thus have learned many revolutionary truths. A young female worker and her companion, while visiting together, said, "The Chinese people have achieved such great successes precisely because they have drawn strength and found methods from Mao Zedong's works. Mao Zedong's works are the red sun."

Some viewers also enthusiastically praised some of Chairman Mao's wise judgments. An elderly worker said, "Comrade Mao Zedong's words, 'If the enemy opposes us, that's good, that means we have drawn a clear line with the enemy,' are absolutely true. Now, the imperialists and revisionists are viciously attacking China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which proves that you are right."

    毛主席高举革命的火炬  引导着全世界人民前进
    罗马尼亚人民热爱和敬仰我们伟大的领袖
    据新华社布加勒斯特二十五日电　中国美术作品展览会最近在罗马尼亚阿拉德市展出期间，罗马尼亚广大观众表达了对中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的无限爱戴和敬仰，他们对展出的体现毛泽东思想的作品表示热烈赞扬。
    “我们热爱毛泽东！”“祝毛泽东万寿无疆！”“向毛泽东转致亲切的问候！”许许多多观众在观看塑造毛主席光辉形象的作品时，向中国同志表达了他们对毛主席发自内心的热爱。一位老教师在看到《决战前夕》油画中的毛主席像时激动地说，“毛泽东像列宁一样伟大，他就是当代的列宁，我们热爱他。”“毛泽东不仅领导中国人民进行革命和建设，而且也领导着世界革命人民进行革命。”一位老工人边看边说，“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他高举国际共产主义运动的革命火炬，指引着全世界无产阶级和革命人民前进的方向。”“中国共产党和毛泽东同志是全世界无产阶级的希望。”“毛泽东主席是我们马克思列宁主义者心中的红太阳。”一位女护士一走到毛主席像前就举手高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”并说，“站在毛泽东主席像前我好像浑身都是力量。毛泽东是伟大的革命导师，他和列宁一样伟大。”她看到《毛主席著作像太阳》的宣传画时说道，“这位老农这样高兴地看毛泽东著作，就像太阳照亮了他的心一样。”当她得知她的理解和画上的标题一样时兴奋地说，“这个标题恰好说到我的心眼里了。”一位职员在《毛主席万岁》的画前说，“毛主席是伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手，这是千真万确的。”
    许多观众在谈到毛主席最近畅游长江的消息时，兴奋地说，毛主席这样健康，这不仅是中国人民的最大幸福，也是全世界革命人民的最大幸福。
    有许多观众还讲述了他们学习毛主席著作的情形。一位中学教师看到反映中国人民大学毛主席著作的画时说，“我也在学习毛泽东的著作。毛泽东同志讲的话太好了。毛泽东同志是非常非常英明的领袖。”三位在农场工作的干部说，他们也在读毛泽东同志的著作，因而懂得了许多革命的道理。一个青年女工和她的同伴一起参观时说，“中国人民取得了这样大的成就，正是由于他们从毛泽东著作中，汲取了力量，找到了方法。毛泽东著作就是红太阳。”
    有些观众还热情地赞扬了毛主席的一些英明论断。一位老工人说，“毛泽东同志说的‘如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了’这句话，是千真万确的。现在帝国主义者和修正主义者恶毒地攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，这就证明了你们做得对。”
