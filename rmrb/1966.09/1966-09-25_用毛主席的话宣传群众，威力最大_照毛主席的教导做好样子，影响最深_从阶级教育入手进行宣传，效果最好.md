How to be a good propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, sowing the seeds of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of the people, so that it takes root, blossoms, and bears fruit? The Party Committee of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army of China has summarized their experience in the practice of spreading Mao Zedong Thought in the Xingtai region: using Chairman Mao's words to propagate among the masses, the power is the greatest; following Chairman Mao's teachings to set an example, the influence is the deepest; according to Chairman Mao's teachings, starting from class education to carry out propaganda, the effect is the best.

This unit formed a propaganda team of ten thousand people in April and May and went to the Xingtai region, which had suffered severe earthquake disasters, to vigorously spread Mao Zedong Thought. The spiritual outlook of the people in the disaster-stricken areas has undergone a fundamental change, achieving a double harvest in political thought and production construction. Their experiences are as follows:

First, using Chairman Mao's words to propagate among the masses, the power is the greatest.

Chairman Mao's words are all truths, with the highest authority and the greatest power, the most able to open people's minds, and the most able to solve problems. The soldiers in the propaganda work, everyone speaks Chairman Mao's words, everywhere writes Chairman Mao's words, and everything does Chairman Mao's words. In the face of disasters, the soldiers recite Chairman Mao's words about daring to struggle and daring to win, and people immediately gain courage and fight against disasters with unwavering confidence; when rebuilding their homes, the soldiers read Chairman Mao's words about self-reliance and hard work, and people are full of spirit and work hard to strive for a bumper harvest. When there are disputes among the community members, they ask the soldiers to help solve them. The soldiers say, "Let's listen to what Chairman Mao says." They open the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read a few passages relevant to the problem. The masses are convinced, and the problem is solved. The community members say, "With Chairman Mao's thought leading the way, even the biggest knot can be untied."

Reading Chairman Mao's books word for word and speaking Chairman Mao's words sentence by sentence, can the peasant masses understand and accept them? Some people had such concerns at the beginning. Practice has proven that Chairman Mao's books are written for the revolution and for the working people. The masses understand them as soon as they hear them, use them as soon as they understand them, and they work as soon as they use them. A soldier in Pingxian County's Youzhuang gave a speech to women. At first, he spoke in his own words, but he couldn't arouse their enthusiasm. Later, he took out the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud, "To build a great socialist society, it is of great significance to mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in production activities. In production, men and women should receive equal pay for equal work. True equality between men and women can only be achieved in the process of socialist transformation of the whole society." As soon as he read this, the atmosphere in the meeting became lively, and everyone listened more and more eagerly. A woman with three children, who used to pay little attention to the collective, heard Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and she did good deeds for the collective everywhere. When the cadres praised her, she said, "What I did was nothing. I can't compare to Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune, nor can I compare to the PLA. Besides, this is what I learned from Chairman Mao's book, and it is what I should do."

Chairman Mao said, "Those who do propaganda work, if they have not investigated, studied, and analyzed their propaganda objects, and just talk nonsense, it is absolutely not allowed." To make Chairman Mao's words reach the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants and achieve immediate results, one must aim at the target. They insisted on starting from reality in their propaganda work, conducting investigations and research, and focusing on the living thoughts of different regions, different objects, and different problems. They selected relevant quotations from Chairman Mao to propagate, achieving targeted learning, active learning and application, and learning and using combined. The community members generally reflected, "The PLA has propagated Mao Zedong Thought vividly." "They speak right to our hearts."

Second, following Chairman Mao's teachings to set an example, the influence is the deepest.

The soldiers who carried out propaganda in the Xingtai region deeply felt that to solve the problems of the people with Mao Zedong Thought, one must first arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought; to make the people act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, one must first firmly execute Chairman Mao's instructions, achieving a close combination of theory and practice, speaking and doing, and consistency between words and deeds. In the propaganda work, the soldiers followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. Everyone became a propagandist and a servant of the people. No matter how far or how tired they walked, as soon as they entered a village, they put down their bags, without washing their faces or drinking water, they went to work in the fields. They did the heaviest work, ate dry rations when hungry, and drank cold water when thirsty. They thought what the poor and lower-middle peasants thought and hurried what the poor and lower-middle peasants hurried, fully embodying the nature of the people's army serving the people wholeheartedly.

The power of example is enormous. The soldiers set an example by following Chairman Mao's teachings, and the masses saw it with their own eyes and remembered it in their hearts, feeling deeply moved. If the masses asked the soldiers, "Why are you so good?" the soldiers would answer, "This is what Chairman Mao told us to do." Then they would open the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud, "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the interests of the people." Because the soldiers did so, the people not only saw the great power of Mao Zedong Thought from the soldiers but also understood from the soldiers' words and deeds how to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. Many community members said, "What Chairman Mao said, the PLA did, I understood it as soon as I saw it."

Third, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, starting from class education to carry out propaganda, the effect is the best.

Chairman Mao said: Class education, once grasped, is effective. Comrade Lin Biao said, "If you don't understand what class is, don't understand what exploitation is, you don't understand revolution." Class education is the foundation of all education. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, starting from class education, recalling bitterness and sweetness with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and reading Chairman Mao's words about class and class struggle together, can fundamentally raise the class consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants and achieve the best effect in spreading Mao Zedong Thought.

As soon as the soldiers entered a village, the first thing they did was to visit the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants to inquire about their hardships. Then they held meetings to recall bitterness and sweetness at the village entrance, in the fields, and on the kang (a traditional Chinese bed). Class education is effective once grasped, and the class consciousness of the people quickly improved. When distributing relief grain and money, a spirit of mutual deference immediately appeared, and those with vague class struggle consciousness also expressed that they would never forget class struggle.

Deep class feelings are the foundation for studying Chairman Mao's works well. After recalling bitterness and sweetness, people loved Chairman Mao even more. They regarded Chairman Mao's books as their "lifeline" and Chairman Mao's words as "words for us poor and lower-middle peasants," and their hearts were even more connected with Chairman Mao's. Many people gratefully said, "Parents are dear, but the Party and Chairman Mao are dearer. Nothing is better than socialism."

Now, the broad masses of the people in the Xingtai region are studying Chairman Mao's works actively and applying them to their lives with deep proletarian feelings. They say, "If you don't study Chairman Mao's books for one day, you can't eat or sleep well; if you don't study Chairman Mao's books for two days, it's like your eyes are covered with fog; if you don't study Chairman Mao's books for three days, you don't know the direction and your heart is confused; if you study Chairman Mao's books every day, you will never lose your way in the revolution." (with pictures)

Chairman Mao is the great savior of the people in the earthquake-stricken areas, and Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the people in the earthquake-stricken areas. The PLA soldiers sent the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait to the community members' homes, letting the community members see Chairman Mao every day.

    解放军某部总结在邢台地区群众中传播毛泽东思想的经验
    用毛主席的话宣传群众，威力最大  照毛主席的教导做好样子，影响最深  从阶级教育入手进行宣传，效果最好
    据新华社邢台二十四日电　怎样当好毛泽东思想宣传队、播种机，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想在广大人民群众中生根、开花、结果？中国人民解放军某部党委从他们在邢台地区的实践中总结出来的经验是：用毛主席的话宣传群众，威力最大，照毛主席的教导做好样子，影响最深，按毛主席的教导，从阶级教育入手，进行宣传，效果最好。
    这支部队在四五月间组成万人宣传队，开赴遭受严重地震灾害的邢台地区，大张旗鼓地传播毛泽东思想，使受灾区人民群众的精神面貌发生了根本变化，取得了政治思想、生产建设双丰收。他们的经验是：
    第一，用毛主席的话宣传群众，威力最大。
    毛主席的话，句句是真理，威信最高，威力最大，最能开人心窍，最能解决问题。指战员在宣传中，人人讲毛主席的话，处处写毛主席的话，事事用毛主席的话。在灾害面前，战士们一念毛主席关于敢于斗争敢于胜利的语录，人们立刻增加了勇气，信心百倍地同灾害作斗争；在重建家园时，战士们一读毛主席关于自力更生、艰苦奋斗的论述，人们就精神焕发地苦干实干，力夺丰收。社员中发生纠纷，要求战士帮助解决，战士们说：“咱们听听毛主席怎么说的吧。”他们翻开《毛主席语录》，针对要解决的问题读上几段，群众就服了，问题解决了。社员们说：“毛主席思想挂了帅，天大疙瘩能解开。”
    原原本本读毛主席的书，一字一句讲毛主席的话，农民群众能不能听懂，能不能接受？开始有人有这种顾虑。实践证明，毛主席的书是为革命写的，为劳动人民写的，群众一听就懂，一懂就用，一用就灵。有个战士在平乡县游庄对妇女进行宣传，开始用自己的话说来说去，怎么也提不起她们的劲头。后来，他把《毛主席语录》掏出来，原原本本念道：“为了建设伟大的社会主义社会，发动广大的妇女群众参加生产活动，具有极大的意义。在生产中，必须实现男女同工同酬。真正的男女平等，只有在整个社会的社会主义改造过程中才能实现。”这么一读，会场上气氛马上活跃了，大家越听越爱听。有个有三个孩子的妇女，过去不大关心集体，听了毛主席关于“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，处处为集体做好事。干部表扬她，她说：“俺做这点小事算个啥，一比不上张思德、白求恩，二比不上解放军。再说，这也是俺从毛主席书里学来的，是俺应该做的。”
    毛主席说：“做宣传工作的人，对于自己的宣传对象没有调查，没有研究，没有分析，乱讲一顿，是万万不行的。”要把毛主席的话讲到贫下中农的心里，收到立竿见影的效果，必须做到有的放矢。他们在宣传中坚持了一切从实际出发，调查研究，大抓活思想，根据不同地区，不同对象，不同问题，选择毛主席有关的语录进行宣传，做到带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学。社员们普遍反映：“解放军把毛主席思想宣传活了。”“一说就说到俺心里了。”
    第二，照毛主席的教导做好样子，影响最深。
    在邢台地区进行宣传的指战员们深深体会到：要用毛泽东思想解决人民群众的问题，首先要用毛泽东思想武装自己；要人民群众按照毛主席的教导去做，自己首先要坚决执行毛主席的指示，做到理论和实践紧密结合，说到做到，言行一致。在宣传中，指战员们遵照毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，人人都当宣传员，人人又是人民的勤务员，不管走了多远多累，一进村，放下背包，脸不洗，水不喝，下地就干活，哪个活重干哪个，饿了啃干粮，渴了喝凉水，想贫下中农所想，急贫下中农所急，充分体现了人民军队一切为人民的本质。
    榜样的力量是巨大的。战士们按照毛主席的教导做好样子，群众看在眼里，记在心上，很受感动。要是群众问战士：“你们怎么这么好？”战士就会回答说：“这是毛主席叫我们这样做的。”接着就翻开《毛主席语录》，一字一句地念道：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”由于指战员们这样做了，人民群众不仅从战士身上看到了毛泽东思想的伟大力量，而且从战士的一言一行中懂得了怎样活学活用毛主席著作。许多社员说：“毛主席怎么说的，解放军怎么做的，俺一看就明白了。”
    第三，按毛主席的教导，从阶级教育入手，进行宣传，效果最好。
    毛主席说：阶级教育，一抓就灵。林彪同志说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”阶级教育是一切教育的基础。按毛主席的教导，从阶级教育入手，和贫下中农一起忆苦思甜，一块读毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述，就能从根本上提高贫下中农的阶级觉悟，收到传播毛泽东思想最好的效果。
    指战员们一进村，头一件事就是到贫下中农家访贫问苦，然后在村头、地头、炕头开忆苦思甜会。阶级教育一抓就灵，人民群众的阶级觉悟迅速提高，发救济粮款时，立刻出现了互相谦让的风气，阶级斗争观念模糊的人也纷纷表示永远不忘阶级斗争。
    深厚的阶级感情，是学好毛主席著作的基础。人们经过忆苦思甜，更加热爱毛主席，他们把毛主席的书当成“命根子”，把毛主席的话看成是“为俺贫下中农说的话”，和毛主席的心连得更紧了，许多人感激地说：“爹亲娘亲不如党和毛主席亲，千好万好不如社会主义好。”
    现在，邢台地区的广大人民群众正在怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作。他们说：“一天不学毛主席的书，吃饭不香睡不熟；两天不学毛主席的书，好像眼睛蒙上雾，三天不学毛主席的书，方向不明心糊涂；天天读毛主席的书，永远革命不迷路。”（附图片）
    毛主席是地震灾区人民的大救星，毛主席是地震灾区人民心中的红太阳。解放军战士把伟大领袖毛主席的像送到社员家里，让社员天天见着毛主席他老人家。　新华社稿
