Shanghai Element Five Factory workers have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the working class, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois technical "authorities," and overthrown the inefficient and wasteful spray towers. They have established proletarian technical authority and created efficient and economical condensers, saving the nation significant funds and pioneering a new method for cooling without using groundwater. Currently, these condensers are being promoted throughout the city.

Previously, Shanghai Element Five Factory used deep well water for cooling. To prevent the lowering of the groundwater level from causing ground subsidence, relevant departments in Shanghai decided to stop using deep well water. The factory then constructed spray towers for cooling, and the construction had already begun. The spray towers had a volume of 400 cubic meters, weighed 150 tons, and required an investment of 60,000 yuan. Workers discovered this situation, deeming it both unsafe and uneconomical, and decided to launch a revolution. They conducted extensive investigations and visits, proposing a plan to build condensers to replace the spray towers. They engaged in serious struggles and debates with a minority of technical staff and bourgeois technical "authorities" who clung to the spray towers, refuting their fallacies one by one. Under the support of the factory party committee, the workers, who had learned Mao Zedong Thought and had rich practical experience, successfully created two condensers.

These two condensers, compared to the spray towers, have the following advantages: construction time is one-third, investment is one-fifth, weight is one-eighteenth, electricity consumption is one-sixth, and water consumption is one-hundred-fiftieth. Additionally, they have higher cooling capacity and larger cooling area.

    破资产阶级“权威”  闯技术革命新路
    上海元件五厂职工创制成功冷凝器
    本报讯　上海元件五厂职工发扬工人阶级的革命造反精神，大破资产阶级技术“权威”，打倒了少慢差费的淋水塔；大立无产阶级技术权威，创制了多快好省的冷凝器，既为国家节约了资金，又为降温不用地下水闯出一条新路。目前，这种冷凝器正在全市推广。
    过去，上海元件五厂是用深井水降温的。上海市有关部门为了防止地下水位降低引起地面下沉，决定停止使用深井水。这个厂就建造淋水塔进行降温，并已施工。淋水塔体积四百立方米，体重一百五十吨，投资六万元。工人们发现这一情况，认为既不安全，又不经济，决心来个革命。他们四出调查访问，提出了建造冷凝器代替淋水塔的方案，并同抱住淋水塔不放的少数技术干部和资产阶级技术“权威”展开了严肃的斗争，进行了多次辩论。学习了毛泽东思想又具有丰富实践经验的工人群众，在厂党委的支持下，把“权威”们摆出的难题一一解决，把“权威”们发出的谬论条条驳倒，终于成功地造出了两台冷凝器。
    这两台冷凝器与淋水塔比较：建造时间只有三分之一，投资只有五分之一，重量只有十八分之一，用电只有六分之一，用水只有一百五十分之一；降温能力更高，冷却面积更大。
