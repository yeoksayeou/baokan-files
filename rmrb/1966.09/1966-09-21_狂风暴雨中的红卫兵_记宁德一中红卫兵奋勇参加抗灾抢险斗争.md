On September 3, Typhoon No. 14 from the Pacific Ocean made landfall in Ningde County, Fujian Province. The winds howled, and the rain poured down in torrents. The ferocity of the winds and the intensity of the rain were unprecedented in the region for decades. At this critical moment, workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, and students formed one team after another to rush to the disaster-stricken areas and engage in a fierce struggle against the raging winds and torrential rains. Among the disaster relief teams, there was a group of the youngest revolutionary youngsters, consisting of more than eighty Red Guards from Ningde County No. 1 Middle School.

Before setting out, the Red Guards opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Red Guard warrior Yu Ruizhong wrote on the blackboard in large characters Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely fight, be unafraid of sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." He solemnly told his classmates, "The time to test us has come. We must learn from Comrade Wang Jie, fearing neither hardship nor death, standing tall against the storm and rain, and definitely defeating and subduing it!"

After a tense preparation, it was already past two in the morning. At this time, the wind and rain were getting stronger. The Red Guard warrior responsible for reconnaissance and observation rushed back and reported: The county tractor station's building had been blown down by the typhoon. Red Guard warriors Yu Ruizhong and Yan Changyuan each led a small team and immediately rushed towards the tractor station. As soon as they stepped out of the gate, they were blown back by the strong wind. The young warriors were fearless, with only five words in their minds: "Serve the People." If one person couldn't move forward, several would join hands and shoulders, facing the 12-level typhoon, and struggle forward. When they reached the tractor station, a PLA disaster relief team had already arrived a step ahead. They immediately proposed: "Learn from the PLA." The PLA soldiers also encouraged them to stay calm and quickly rescue the workers trapped under the rubble. The Red Guards, following the PLA's orders, rushed forward one after another, swiftly removing the beams and tiles from the collapsed building, and rescuing the trapped workers. In the intense struggle, a flying brick hit one Red Guard's foot. He let out a cry of pain, but suddenly remembered to learn from the PLA, not to leave the battlefield with minor injuries, so he gritted his teeth and endured the pain, continuing to rescue people. In this way, after more than an hour of intense battle, they finally rescued all eight workers and cadres trapped under the rubble and moved them to a safe place.

As soon as one battle ended, another report came in: A state granary in the suburbs had been damaged by the strong winds, and the heavy rain was pouring in, endangering the large amount of grain stored inside. The Red Guards, with a single mind to rescue state property, disregarded their own fatigue after a day and night of intense battle, and immediately regrouped to rush to the scene. At this time, part of the local troops and poor and lower-middle peasants had already arrived. The young warriors saw them skillfully carrying heavy sacks weighing over 160 pounds each, walking swiftly against the wind, and shouted, "Learn from the PLA!" "Learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants!" They were small in size and couldn't carry a sack alone, so two of them carried one sack together. The PLA soldiers and poor and lower-middle peasants saw the young warriors so brave, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and praised and cared for them, advising them to carry less to avoid hurting themselves. However, the Red Guards carried with even greater vigor. In the deep night, when it was difficult to walk, they lit torches to illuminate the path and continued to rush and carry. Together with the PLA and the poor and lower-middle peasants, they finally rescued all the grain that was easily affected by the rain and moved it to a safe place.

When the Red Guard young warriors returned victorious, they were praised from all sides: "The Red Guard young warriors are truly excellent!" "They are indeed the little red soldiers educated by Chairman Mao!"

    狂风暴雨中的红卫兵
    ——记宁德一中红卫兵奋勇参加抗灾抢险斗争
    九月三日，来自太平洋上的十四号强台风，从福建东部宁德县登陆。狂风怒吼，暴雨倾盆，风势之大，来势之猛，为当地几十年所少见。在这紧要时刻，工人、农民、解放军、干部和学生，组成了一支又一支抗灾大军，奔向受灾的地方，同狂风暴雨展开了英勇顽强的搏斗。在抗灾大军中，有一支年纪最轻的革命小将队伍，他们是宁德县第一中学的八十多名红卫兵。
    出发前，红卫兵们翻开了《毛主席语录》。红卫兵战士余瑞忠在黑板上用大字写下毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”并严肃地对同学们说：“考验我们的时候到了，我们要学习王杰同志，一不怕苦，二不怕死，在暴风雨面前挺起腰杆，一定要战胜它，压倒它！”
    红卫兵们经过一番紧张准备，已经是午夜二时多了。这时风雨越来越猛。负责侦察瞭望的红卫兵战士飞奔而来。他向大家报告：县拖拉机站的房屋被台风刮坍了。红卫兵战士余瑞忠和颜常源各带一个小组，立即向拖拉机站冲去。他们刚出大门，就被大风刮得寸步难行。小将们天不怕，地不怕，头脑里只有五个字：为人民服务。一个人走不动，就几个人肩并着肩，手挽着手，迎着十二级强台风，拚力前进。当他们冲到拖拉机站的时候，一支解放军抗灾抢险的队伍已经提前一步赶来。他们立即提出：向解放军学习。解放军战士们也鼓励他们要沉着，赶快救出被压在屋下的工人兄弟。红卫兵们听从解放军的指挥，一个个争先恐后，敏捷地掀掉房屋的栋桁，扒开砖瓦，救出被压的工人。在紧张的搏斗中，一砖飞来，正巧打在一个红卫兵的脚上，他哎呀一声，刚要喊出口，突然想起向解放军学习，轻伤不下火线，就咬紧牙关，忍住疼痛，继续救人。就这样，经过一个多小时的激烈战斗，终于把被压在屋里的八个工人、干部全部救出，转移到安全地方。
    一场激战刚刚结束，又接到通知：城郊一座国家粮仓被大风刮坏，暴雨倾盆，仓里存着大量粮食，十分危急。红卫兵们一心想抢救国家财产，不顾自己经过一天一夜激烈战斗的疲劳，全队八十多名红卫兵又马上整队赶向现场。这时，当地一部分驻军和贫下中农已经赶到。小将们看到他们一个个熟练地背起重达一百六十多斤的大麻袋，迎风疾走，都高喊道：“向解放军学习！”“向贫下中农学习！”他们人小，一人背不动一袋，就两人合抬一袋。解放军战士和贫下中农社员见小将们这么勇敢，不怕苦，不怕累，又称赞又关心，劝他们少抬一些，不要压坏了身体。可是，红卫兵们越抬劲越大。深夜，行走不便，他们就点燃火炬，照亮道路，继续抢搬。他们和解放军、贫下中农一起，终于又把容易受雨淋的粮食全部抢搬到安全地带。
    当红卫兵小将们胜利归来时，四处是一片赞扬声：“红卫兵小将们真是好样的！”“真是毛主席教导出来的红小兵！”
