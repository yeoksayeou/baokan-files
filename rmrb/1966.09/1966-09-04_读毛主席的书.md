Sunflowers turn towards the sun, seedlings love the dew,
Chairman Mao's books, the poor and lower-middle peasants love to read.
Reading makes the heart bright, reading makes the eyes shine,
Reading makes revolutionary willpower firm, reading makes the body full of vigor.

Reading Chairman Mao's books in the fields, working becomes like a tiger;
Reading Chairman Mao's books under the lamp, the sun rises at midnight;
Reading Chairman Mao's books in times of difficulty, ten thousand hardships cannot stop us;
Reading Chairman Mao's books in times of victory, we strive for more without satisfaction.

Learn a bit, use a bit, read a passage, make a step forward.
Reading over and over, everyone becomes a pillar,
Moving mountains, driving away tigers, spreading spring for ten thousand miles with both hands.
In the three great revolutions, we are the vanguard, painting a grand blueprint for a splendid country.

Sunflowers turn towards the sun, seedlings love the dew,
Chairman Mao's books, the poor and lower-middle peasants love to read.
The more we read, the brighter our hearts become,
Doing as Chairman Mao says, we make rapid progress,
On the revolutionary road, we take big strides.

    读毛主席的书
    四川达县草坝公社第七生产大队业余创作组葵花向太阳，禾苗爱雨露，毛主席的书，贫下中农最爱读。读得心里亮堂堂，读得两眼赛明珠，读得革命意志坚，读得浑身干劲足。地头读一读毛主席的书，干起活来赛猛虎；灯下读一读毛主席的书，半夜三更太阳出；困难时读一读毛主席的书，千难万难挡不住；胜利时读一读毛主席的书，再接再厉不满足。学一点，用一点，读一篇，进一步。读过一遍又一遍，人人都是顶梁柱，移山造海驱虎豹，万里春光双手铺。三大革命当闯将，锦绣江山起宏图。葵花向太阳，禾苗爱雨露，毛主席的书，贫下中农最爱读。越读心里越亮堂，毛主席咋说我咋做，活学活用进步快，革命路上迈大步。
