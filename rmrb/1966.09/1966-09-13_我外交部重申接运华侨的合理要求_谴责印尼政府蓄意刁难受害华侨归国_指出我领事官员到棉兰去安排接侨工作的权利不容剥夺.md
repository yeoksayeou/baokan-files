The Chinese Foreign Ministry on September 12 sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China, demanding that the Indonesian government change its unreasonable stance of obstructing China's repatriation of affected overseas Chinese and promptly arrange for Chinese consular officials to go to Medan. The note also urges the Indonesian government to provide a satisfactory response to the various reasonable demands outlined in China's September 5 note as soon as possible.

The note states: "On September 5, the Chinese government notified the Indonesian government that the first Chinese ship to repatriate affected overseas Chinese will arrive in Medan around September 20. To ensure the smooth repatriation of affected overseas Chinese, the Chinese government has decided to send the Consul-General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, and others to Medan to handle relevant matters. This is entirely reasonable. On September 9, the Deputy Director of the Asian-Pacific Division of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Mazonni, met with the Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Yao Dengshan, and stated that the Indonesian government believes it is not yet time to allow Chinese officials to go to Medan. Regarding the other demands raised in the Chinese government's September 5 note, he also avoided giving a response. The Indonesian government's attitude is utterly unreasonable. The Chinese government expresses regret over this."

The note points out, "The repatriation of affected overseas Chinese by Chinese ships is a major issue involving relations between the two countries and must be jointly resolved by officials from both governments. It cannot be unilaterally decided and handled by the Indonesian government. Chinese consular officials going to Medan to organize and arrange the repatriation of affected overseas Chinese, handle passports, visas, and other relevant procedures, and take care of Chinese ships are exercising their normal duties, which cannot be deprived of, and are entirely in accordance with international customs. The Indonesian government, while agreeing to the repatriation of the affected overseas Chinese by Chinese ships, is obstructing Chinese consular officials from going to Medan. This can only be seen as deliberately creating difficulties and setting obstacles to achieve its goal of harassing and sabotaging the repatriation of affected overseas Chinese. This is unacceptable to the Chinese government."

    我外交部重申接运华侨的合理要求
    谴责印尼政府蓄意刁难受害华侨归国
    指出我领事官员到棉兰去安排接侨工作的权利不容剥夺
    新华社十二日讯中国外交部十二日照会印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，要求印度尼西亚政府改变阻挠中国接运受害华侨的无理态度，迅速安排中国领事官员前往棉兰，并对中国政府九月五日照会中提出的各项合理要求，尽快作出圆满的答复。
    照会说：“中国政府九月五日照会通知印度尼西亚政府，中国第一艘接侨船只将于九月二十日左右抵达棉兰港口。为了使接运受害华侨的工作能够顺利进行，中国政府决定派驻雅加达总领事徐仁等人去棉兰安排有关事宜，这是完全合情合理的。印度尼西亚外交部亚洲太平洋司副司长马佐尼九月九日接见中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆临时代办姚登山，竟然表示印度尼西亚政府认为现在还不是允许中国官员去棉兰的时候，对中国政府九月五日照会中提出的其他几项要求，也避不作答。印度尼西亚政府这种态度是毫无道理的。中国政府对此表示遗憾。”
    照会指出，“中国派船接运受害华侨回国，是涉及两国关系的重大事务，必须由两国政府官员会同解决，不能由印度尼西亚政府片面决定处理。中国领事官员到棉兰进行接运受害华侨回国的组织安排工作，办理护照签证等有关手续，并照料中国船只，这是他们行使正常职务不容剥夺的权利，也是完全符合国际惯例的。印度尼西亚政府既然同意中国政府派船接回难侨，却又阻挠中国领事官员去棉兰，只能被认为是故意制造困难，设置障碍，以达到它刁难和破坏受害华侨回国的目的。这是中国政府不能同意的。”
