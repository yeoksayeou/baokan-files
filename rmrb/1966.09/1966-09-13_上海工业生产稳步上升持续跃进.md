The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has become a powerful force for developing production in Shanghai. Industrial production in Shanghai is steadily rising and making continuous leaps forward. The revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers is soaring. In July and August, they overcame the unprecedented prolonged high temperatures. Many important products have increased significantly compared to the same period last year; a batch of important new products with modern advanced levels have been successfully trial-produced.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 12th: Currently, in China's largest industrial city, Shanghai, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new high tide, and industrial production has presented a new situation of all-around leaps and bounds. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is becoming a powerful force for developing industrial production in Shanghai. The revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of workers is unparalleled. Building on the tremendous achievements in industrial production in the first half of the year, they have made further progress in July and August. Many industries have broken the conventional pattern of production decline during the high-temperature season and achieved unprecedented victories of steady and continuous production increases. To build socialism, there are two fronts: spiritual and material. Great Mao Zedong Thought guides Shanghai workers to advance bravely on both fronts and achieve new victories.

Shanghai workers, who have always held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advanced bravely, have, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, more deeply realized that to build socialism, there are two fronts: spiritual and material. They are determined to thoroughly eliminate all ideological remnants of the exploiting classes and let Mao Zedong Thought take deep root in people's minds; at the same time, they must continuously achieve new victories on the production front and build our socialist motherland into an ironclad proletarian fortress. The broad masses of workers are fighting bravely on both fronts. In July and August, they overcame the unprecedented prolonged high temperatures. Industries most affected by the high-temperature season, such as metallurgy, chemicals, and textiles, not only did not see a decline in production but maintained stability and even slight increases, breaking the conventional rules of industrial production. The production of products that play a significant role in developing the national economy, such as new metal materials, high polymer synthetic materials, automated instruments and meters, transistors, optical instruments, low-temperature equipment, precision machine tools, tractors, automobiles, fertilizers, pesticides, and synthetic fibers, has all increased significantly compared to the same period last year. The quality of the city's main products is stable, and some have improved; and a batch of important new products with modern advanced levels have been successfully trial-produced.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive guiding Shanghai workers to advance bravely on both the spiritual and material fronts. In the cultural revolution, it is Mao Zedong Thought that leads the workers to charge into battle; it is Mao Zedong Thought that helps them scale one scientific and technological peak after another. In every workshop, on every machine, and in every activity venue and place of struggle, workers have posted quotations from Chairman Mao. They draw boundless strength from Chairman Mao's teachings at every moment and in every matter. The high-temperature season brought great difficulties to production. Chairman Mao's teaching of "Resolutely to carry out the task, fearing neither sacrifice nor difficulty, and overcoming all obstacles to win victory" filled the workers with confidence in victory, and they bravely overcame all kinds of difficulties. The workers most resolutely declared: Under the leadership of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, they must be the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the main force of the production struggle, achieving double victories in the cultural revolution and production.

In early August, the outdoor temperature in Shanghai remained around 38 degrees Celsius, and the temperature in the workshops was even higher. Shanghai metallurgical workers always maintained the attitude of masters, firmly guarding their production posts, and smelted various alloy steels and high-quality steels urgently needed by the state. The production of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai's textile industry has always maintained an advanced level.

Once the spiritual shackles of the old world are smashed, the boundless creative wisdom and talent of the broad masses of workers are fully unleashed to the maximum extent.

The achievements of many factories show: once the capitalist-roaders in power are overthrown, the reactionary "experts" and "authorities" of the bourgeoisie are criticized, and the various spiritual shackles of the old world are discarded, the boundless creative wisdom and talent of the broad masses of workers are fully unleashed to the maximum extent. Many things that were previously impossible to do were accomplished in a short period; some long-standing technical problems were solved in a few days; many new technologies, new materials, new equipment, and new designs were developed. Many major new products, such as new engineering plastics that can withstand high and low temperatures and are used to manufacture various high-speed machine parts and high-grade insulating materials, new high-grade transistors, small coordinate boring machines with a machining accuracy of three microns, large gear grinding machines that can process precision gears with a diameter of up to 1.6 meters, continuous vacuum coating equipment, etc., were all quickly trial-produced by the workers in the past few months.

The production of electric meters has a history of more than ten years at the Hengcheng Electrical Appliance Factory. Previously, only second-grade electric meters could be produced. Under the control of bourgeois technical "authorities," the progress of new product trials was slow. The three-phase three-wire first-grade electric meter, which was originally scheduled to be successfully trial-produced in the first quarter of this year, was not produced until June due to the arbitrary actions of the bourgeois technical "authorities," who "only hatched but did not lay eggs." In the cultural revolution, the workers exposed the cover of class struggle in the technical field with big-character posters and seized the technical power from the bourgeois technical "authorities." Following Chairman Mao's great strategic thinking of breaking foreign frameworks and taking our own path of industrial development, the workers dared to break, dare to establish, dare to forge ahead, and dare to innovate. In just two weeks and with only over 200 yuan, they successfully trial-produced the first-grade electric meter.

A large number of previously unknown young people, following Chairman Mao's great teaching that the lowly are the wisest and the noble are the most foolish, have shown extraordinary talents in scientific research.

It is particularly gratifying that a large number of previously unknown young people on Shanghai's industrial front have emerged, showing extraordinary talents. They are the brave pioneers of the cultural revolution and the fearless warriors of the production struggle. More than 30 young workers and technicians at the Shanghai Guanghua Scientific Instrument Factory, with an average age of less than 25, together with all the workers in the factory, used big-character posters and big debates to defeat the bourgeois "authorities" in the factory, criticizing various forms of slavish thoughts thoroughly. They conducted scientific research following Chairman Mao's great teaching that the lowly are the wisest and the noble are the most foolish. After half a year of hard work, they broke through layer upon layer of obstacles and successfully created two important precision measuring instruments—high-precision standard capacitors and high-precision AC resistance boxes—using entirely domestic materials, advancing the level of these two products from the 1940s to the 1960s.

Many factory and enterprise leaders, following the spirit of the central instructions, organized two teams under unified leadership: one team mainly focuses on the cultural revolution, and the other mainly focuses on production, ensuring a bountiful harvest in both the cultural revolution and production.

    无产阶级文化大革命成为发展生产强大推动力
    上海工业生产稳步上升持续跃进
    广大职工的革命精神昂扬，七八两月战胜了历年罕见的持续高温。许多重要产品比去年同期有较大幅度的增长；试制成功一批重要的具有现代先进水平的新产品。
    据新华社上海十二日电　当前在我国最大的工业城市上海，无产阶级文化大革命进入了新的高潮，工业生产也出现了全面跃进的新局面。无产阶级文化大革命，正在成为上海发展工业生产的一个强大的推动力。广大职工革命精神无比昂扬，在上半年取得工业生产巨大成就的基础上，七八两月又乘胜前进。许多行业打破了历年高温季节生产下降的惯例，夺得了前所未有的生产持续稳步上升的新胜利。
    搞社会主义，有精神和物质两条战线。伟大的毛泽东思想引导上海工人在两条战线上奋勇前进，夺取新胜利。
    一直坚持高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进的上海工人阶级，在无产阶级文化大革命中，更加深刻地认识到，搞社会主义，有精神和物质两条战线。他们决心彻底消灭一切剥削阶级的意识形态，让毛泽东思想在人们头脑里牢牢扎根；同时要在生产战线上不断地夺取新的胜利，把我们的社会主义祖国建设成无产阶级铁打江山。广大职工在这两条战线上奋勇作战，七八两月战胜了历年罕见的持续高温。冶金、化工、纺织等最易受高温季节影响的行业，生产不仅没有下降，而且保持稳定并略有上升，打破了工业生产上的常规。对发展国民经济有重大作用的新型金属材料、高分子合成材料、自动化仪器仪表、晶体管、光学仪器、低温设备、精密机床、拖拉机、汽车、化肥、农药、合成纤维等产品的产量，都比去年同期有较大幅度的增长。全市主要产品质量稳定，部分还有提高；并试制成功一批重要的具有现代先进水平的新产品。
    伟大的毛泽东思想是引导上海工人阶级在精神和物质两条战线上奋勇前进的火车头。广大职工在文化大革命中就是靠的毛泽东思想冲锋陷阵；就是靠的毛泽东思想攀上了一个又一个科学技术高峰。在各个工厂的车间里、机器上，在一切活动场所和人们战斗的地方，工人们都张贴了毛主席语录。他们时时、事事从毛主席的教导中汲取了无穷无尽的力量。高温季节给生产带来了很大困难。毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，使工人们充满了必胜的信心，勇敢地战胜了种种困难。工人们最坚决地表示：在伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的领导下，一定要当好无产阶级文化大革命的主力军，一定要当好生产斗争的主力军，夺取文化革命和生产双胜利。
    八月上旬，上海室外气温一直高达三十八度左右，车间的温度更高。上海冶金工人们始终以主人翁的姿态，坚守生产岗位，炼出了国家急需的各种合金钢和优质钢。上海纺织工业棉纱、棉布的生产一直保持先进水平。
    一旦打碎了旧世界的种种精神枷锁，广大职工群众无限丰富的创造智慧和才能，就最大限度地发挥出来了。
    许多工厂的成就表明：一旦斗垮了走资本主义道路的当权派，批判了资产阶级反动的“专家”“权威”，丢掉了旧世界的种种精神枷锁，广大职工群众无限丰富的创造智慧和才能，就最大限度地发挥出来了。许多原来无法办到的事，在短期内做到了；一些长期没有解决的技术难题，几天之内解决了；许多新工艺、新技术、新材料、新设备、新设计，他们搞出来了。许多重大新产品，如能耐高温、耐低温、用来制造各种高速机械零件和高级绝缘材料的新型工程塑料，新型的高级晶体管，加工精度达三微米的小型座标镗床，可以加工直径达一点六米精密齿轮的大型齿轮磨床，连续真空镀膜设备等等，职工群众都在最近几个月很快地试制出来了。
    生产电度表已有十多年历史的和成电器厂，以前只能生产二级电度表。在资产阶级技术“权威”把持下，新产品试制进度很慢。原定今年第一季度试制成功的三相三线一级电度表，由于资产阶级技术“权威”独断专行，“光孵鸡窝不下蛋”，到了六月份还没有搞出初样。在文化大革命中，工人群众用大字报揭开了技术领域里阶级斗争的盖子，从资产阶级技术“权威”手里夺回了技术权。工人们遵循毛主席关于打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路的伟大战略思想的教导，敢破、敢立、敢闯、敢创，只用两个星期的时间，花了两百多元，就把一级电度表试制出来了。
    大批不出名的年轻人，遵照毛主席关于卑贱者最聪明、尊贵者最愚蠢的伟大教导进行科学研究，显示了非凡才能。
    特别可喜的是，上海工业战线一大批本来不出名的年轻人初露头角，显示了非凡的才能。他们是文化大革命中勇敢的闯将，也是生产斗争中无畏的战士。沪光科学仪器厂三十多个青年工人和技术人员，平均年龄不到二十五岁。他们和全厂职工一起，用大字报、大辩论，把厂内的资产阶级“权威”打得落花流水，把形形色色的洋奴思想批判得淋漓尽致。他们按照毛主席关于卑贱者最聪明、尊贵者最愚蠢的伟大教导进行科学研究。经过半年的奋战，他们冲破层层阻拦，完全用国产的材料创制成功两种重要的精密计量仪器——高精度标准电容和高精度交流电阻箱，使这两种产品的水平一下子从四十年代跃进到六十年代。
    许多工厂企业的领导干部，根据中央的指示精神，在统一的领导下组织了两个班子，一个班子主要抓文化革命，一个班子主要抓生产，保证了文化革命和生产双丰收。
