In 1959, when a small clique of right-opportunists within the Party launched a frenzied attack on the Party, a black wind also swept through the literary and artistic circles: there was a surge in writing articles and performing plays about Hai Rui. Wu Han “broke through the door” and was the first to throw out the poisonous weed *Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor*. Various local demons and monsters responded in unison, and for a time, the plays praising the “spirit of Hai Rui” became rampant. It has now been revealed that the person who advocated the spirit of Hai Rui and directed the production of the Hai Rui plays was none other than Zhou Yang. At that time, Zhou Yang felt that the time was ripe and personally took charge, traveling north and south, up and down, directing various local demons and monsters to meticulously create the poisonous weeds—Hai Rui plays.

Instructing the director of *Hai Rui Petitions the Throne* in Shanghai

In the spring of 1959, Zhou Yang went to Shanghai and immediately “summoned” the anti-communist and anti-people veteran Zhou Xinfan to his residence to give instructions. He said, “Hai Rui is a remarkable figure, and we should write and perform a play about him.” He also said, “Now everyone is afraid to speak up, and performing such plays is necessary.” He specially gave Zhou Xinfan two books, *The Strange Case of Hai Jianfeng* and *The Collected Works of Qiu Hai*, as “materials” for creating the poisonous weeds.

At the same time, Zhou Yang promoted Hai Rui everywhere, creating public opinion for the emergence of the Hai Rui plays. At a symposium in Shanghai’s literary and artistic circles, he said, “Even in the feudal era, there were loyal and just figures with a sense of justice. Hai Rui is a remarkable figure.” He incited, “Now some people are cowardly, and their criticism is limited to section chiefs. They dare not go any higher. Don’t be afraid, speak up if you should, and criticize if you should.”

Just as the whole country was celebrating the tenth anniversary of the founding of New China, *Hai Rui Petitions the Throne* was released. This black play viciously cursed the Party Central Committee for being “tyrannical” and “having no head like having no head”; it loudly advocated “pulling them down from their horses” and carrying out a capitalist restoration.

In February 1961, Zhou Yang watched *Hai Rui Petitions the Throne* in Shanghai and praised it, saying, “It is well-written and well-performed.” He asked publishing houses and newspapers to publish and print the script of *Hai Rui Petitions the Throne*. Later, at a national conference, Zhou Yang again loudly proclaimed, “We must cultivate the spirit of Hai Rui petitioning the throne,” providing cover and encouragement for the right-opportunists.

Rushing to Hainan to select materials, *Hai Rui Returns to Court* is released

In February 1959, Zhou Yang traveled thousands of miles to Hainan Island, carefully selecting records of Hai Rui from a large pile of *Qiongzhou Prefecture Chronicles*. After finding these new ammunition to attack the Party, he was overjoyed. From Haikou to Yulin, he repeatedly praised Hai Rui, saying, “Hai Rui is fearless of authority and dares to scold the emperor, remarkable.” He also maliciously incited, “Hainan is remarkable, it produced Hai Rui.”

Under Zhou Yang’s planning and incitement, by August and September of that year, the Qiong opera *Hai Rui Returns to Court* was released. This play fabricated a scene where Hai Rui, in his later years, “returns to court to eliminate evil,” letting Hai Rui, under the banner of “meeting a dragon and cutting off its horns, encountering a tiger and knocking off its teeth,” “determine to die,” and “fight to the death with the traitors.” This Hai Rui is the incarnation of the “ghost” of right-opportunism, inciting the reactionary classes to stage a “palace coup” and attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. This play especially emphasized the “return to court,” which was actually a call for the right-opportunists who had been removed from office to counterattack.

Going to Tianjin to personally direct *The Five-Colored Sedan*, making it more poisonous

The Hebei clapper opera *The Five-Colored Sedan* was adapted from the Peking opera *The Great Red Robe*. In August 1961, Zhou Yang and others went to Tianjin and “had to watch this play.” While watching, they commented and laughed, very pleased. After watching the play, Zhou Yang, when meeting with the scriptwriters and directors, especially praised the extremely vicious “parade” scene, saying, “It is handled very profoundly.” He also incited the troupe to perform in Beijing.

In *The Five-Colored Sedan*, Hai Rui appears as a seven-rank county magistrate who was demoted to Chun’an. He changed his tactics, no longer like before, bare-chested and shouting. This new “Hai Rui” advised the demons and monsters to hide their ferocious anti-Party true faces, put on a smiling mask, and continue to fight against our Party with the method of hinting and insinuating.

Zhou Yang and others were very “appreciative” of this play, and under their direction, the script underwent important revisions, strengthening its reactionary theme. The entire play ended with Hai Rui’s “complete victory,” using Hai Rui’s “victory” to incite the right-opportunists to “try again after failure.”

Zhou Yang’s advocacy of the counter-revolutionary “spirit of Hai Rui” and his personal deployment of the large-scale production of Hai Rui plays aimed to use the rotting corpse of Hai Rui from three hundred years ago to serve the cause of capitalist restoration.

### 是谁煽起了海瑞戏的黑风？

    是谁煽起了海瑞戏的黑风？
    一九五九年，正当党内一小撮右倾机会主义分子，向党发动猖狂进攻的时候，文艺界也刮起一阵黑风：大做海瑞文章，大演海瑞戏。吴晗“破门而出”，最先抛出了大毒草《海瑞骂皇帝》，各地的牛鬼蛇神紧相呼应，一时鼓吹“海瑞精神”的海瑞戏，甚嚣尘上。现在查明，海瑞精神的鼓吹者，制造海瑞戏的总指挥，不是别人，正是周扬。当时周扬感到时机已到，便亲自出马，南北奔跑，上下串联，指挥各地牛鬼蛇神精心制造毒草——海瑞戏。
    到上海面授机宜导演《海瑞上疏》
    一九五九年春，周扬一到上海，便在住所“召见”反共反人民的老手周信芳，面授机宜。他说：“海瑞是一个了不起的人物，要编个戏演演。”还说：“现在大家不敢讲话，演一演这类戏是需要的。”他特地给了周信芳两本书：《海刚峰奇案》和《丘海两公合集》，作为制造毒草的“原料”。
    与此同时，周扬到处吹捧海瑞，为海瑞戏出笼制造舆论。他在上海文艺界的一次座谈会上说：“封建时代也有忠心耿耿富有正义感的高尚的人物。海瑞就是个了不起的人物。”他煽动说：“现在有些人胆子小，批评只限于科长一级干部，再上去就不敢了。……不要怕，该憎就憎，该讲就讲。”
    正当全国欢庆新中国成立十周年的时候，《海瑞上疏》出笼了。这出黑戏疯狂地咒骂党中央“无道”，“有头如同无头”；大肆叫嚷“要将他们拉下马”，实行资本主义复辟。
    一九六一年二月，周扬在上海看了《海瑞上疏》，连声称赞“写得好，演得好”。他要出版社和报纸刊物出版和发表《海瑞上疏》的剧本。以后，在一次全国性的会议上，周扬又大叫大嚷“要培养海瑞上本的精神”，为右倾机会主义分子张目壮胆。
    奔海南精选原料《海瑞回朝》出笼
    一九五九年二月，周扬万里迢迢赶到海南岛，从一大堆《琼州府志》里，专门精心挑选记载海瑞的资料。当他找到这些向党进攻的新弹药之后，简直如获至宝。从海口一直看到榆林，他一再向人吹捧海瑞，说：“海瑞不畏权贵，敢骂皇帝，了不起。”他又别有用心地煽动说：“海南了不起，出了个海瑞。”
    在周扬的策划和煽动下，到这年八、九月间，琼剧《海瑞回朝》出笼了。这出戏捏造了一个海瑞晚年“回朝除奸”的情节，让海瑞打着“逢龙截角，遇虎敲牙”的旗号，“下定死心”，要把“大好头颅”“同奸佞们拼过”。这个海瑞，是右倾机会主义“阴魂”的化身，他鼓动反动阶级起来搞“宫廷政变”，妄图推翻无产阶级专政。这出戏特别在“回朝”上做文章，实际上就是要被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子起来反攻倒算。
    去天津亲自指点《五彩轿》越改越毒
    河北梆子《五彩轿》，是根据京剧《大红袍》改编的。一九六一年八月，周扬等人到天津，“非看这个戏不可”。看戏的时候，他们边议边笑，高兴得很。周扬在看戏以后接见编导人员时，特别夸奖戏中极恶毒的“游街”一场戏，说：“处理得很深刻。”他还鼓动剧团到北京来演出。
    《五彩轿》里的海瑞，是以一个被贬官到淳安的七品县令的面貌出现的。他改换了斗争方式，不再像当年那样气势汹汹地赤膊上阵、大叫大骂了。这个新“海瑞”，劝戒那些牛鬼蛇神们藏匿起疯狂的反党真面目，伪装出一副笑脸，以旁敲侧击、指桑骂槐的手法继续同我们党斗争。
    周扬等人十分“赏识”这出戏，在他们的指挥下，剧本作了重要的修改，加强了它的反动主题思想。全剧以海瑞大获“全胜”而告终，以海瑞的“胜利”，来鼓动右倾机会主义分子“失败了再干”。
    周扬鼓吹反革命的“海瑞精神”，亲自部署大搞海瑞戏的目的，是要借三百年前海瑞这具腐烂的死尸，为资本主义复辟效劳。
