The Vietnamese military and civilians have shot down over 1,400 U.S. aircraft. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam sends congratulations on the glorious victory of the northern military and civilians.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 10th, under the great battle call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the military and civilians of North Vietnam have achieved new glorious victories in shattering the U.S. "air superiority." According to a report released here on the 10th: By September 9th, the total number of U.S. aggressor aircraft shot down by the military and civilians of North Vietnam has exceeded 1,400.

On the 9th, multiple batches of U.S. aggressor aircraft invaded the provinces of Lao Cai, Bac Ninh, Quang Binh, and Quang Ninh in North Vietnam. Local military and civilians, inspired by the spirit of decisive battle and active annihilation of the enemy, fought bravely and shot down five U.S. jet aircraft in one go, and also captured a U.S. pilot.

Among them, the military and civilians of Lao Cai Province shot down one aircraft, achieving the feat of shooting down the 1,400th U.S. aggressor aircraft in North Vietnam. The military and civilians of Bac Ninh and Quang Binh Provinces each shot down one aircraft. The military and civilians of Quang Ninh Province shot down two aircraft, one of which was shot down at night.

In addition, the military and civilians of Quang Ninh Province shot down two U.S. aircraft on September 6th.

Thus, by September 9th, the military and civilians of North Vietnam had shot down a total of 1,404 U.S. aggressor aircraft.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 10th, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front and the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, warmly congratulating the military and civilians of North Vietnam on their glorious victory of shooting down over 1,400 U.S. aggressor aircraft by September 9th.

The telegram pointed out that this victory further demonstrates the immense power of people's war, once again thoroughly shattering the myth of U.S. "air superiority" and the U.S. imperialists' "escalation" of the war in the North. This is also a fitting response to the U.S. imperialists' deceitful talk of "peace negotiations," embodying the Vietnamese people's determination to give them a heavy blow and strive for a complete victory.

The telegram said, the people of South Vietnam understand from their own experience that to achieve true independence, democracy, and peace, they must drive the U.S. aggressors out of the country, overthrow the dictatorial and corrupt regime of the U.S.-backed Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky clique, and seize power for the people.

The telegram expressed that the military and civilians of South Vietnam are determined to press forward bravely, achieve their goals, and will not stop fighting until they do.

    越南军民已击落美机一千四百多架
    南越民族解放阵线电贺北方军民的辉煌胜利
    据新华社河内十日电　越南北方军民在胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召鼓舞下，在粉碎美国“空中优势”中，取得新的辉煌胜利。据这里十日公布：到九月九日为止，越南北方军民击落的美国强盗飞机总数已经超过一千四百架。
    九日，美国强盗飞机多批侵犯越南北方谅山、河北、广平和广宁等省。当地军民发扬决战决胜和积极歼敌的精神，英勇战斗，一举击落美国喷气式飞机五架，并且活捉了美国飞贼。
    其中，谅山省军民击落一架，建立了越南北方军民击落第一千四百架美国强盗飞机的战功。河北和广平省军民也各击落一架。广宁省军民击落两架，其中有一架是在夜间击落的。
    此外，广宁省军民在九月六日共击落美国飞机两架。
    这样，到九月九日为止，越南北方军民共击落美国强盗飞机一千四百零四架。
    新华社河内十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南南方解放武装力量指挥部，十日打电报给越南祖国战线中央委员会和越南人民军总司令部，热烈祝贺越南北方军民到九月九日为止共击落美国强盗飞机一千四百多架的辉煌胜利。
    贺电指出，这个胜利更加说明人民战争的无比巨大的威力，再一次彻底粉碎了美国“空中优势”的神话，粉碎了美帝国主义在北方进行的战争“升级”。这也是对美帝国主义重弹“和平谈判”欺骗论调的应有回答，体现了越南人民坚决给它以沉重打击和争取彻底胜利的决心。
    贺电说，越南南方人民以自己的切身经验懂得：要有真正的独立、民主与和平，就必须把美帝国主义侵略者赶出祖国，推翻由它扶植起来的阮文绍—阮高其集团的独裁、腐朽制度，把政权夺取到人民手里。
    贺电表示，越南南方军民决心勇往直前，实现自己的目标，不达到目的决不停止战斗。
