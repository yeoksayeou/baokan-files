In March 1964, I went to work as a temporary worker at the Fifth Food Hall in Xifeng Town, Qingyang County, Gansu Province. At that time, I thought that the Party had nurtured me for many years, and I must listen to the Party's words and serve the people wholeheartedly. On the other hand, I also felt that the work in the food hall was rough and tedious. As long as I turned raw materials into cooked food and served it to the customers, there was nothing difficult about it. However, the reality was not as simple as that. As soon as I entered the food hall, I discovered many things that I couldn't stand. For example, our department head and the cook treated customers differently: they treated familiar customers one way and unfamiliar customers another. They treated familiar customers well and unfamiliar customers poorly. They even instructed me to serve the better quality dishes to familiar customers and the poorer quality dishes to unfamiliar customers. One day, two customers came in at the same time and ordered the same dish of meat thread soup. The cook put more meat threads in the soup for the familiar customer and less in the soup for the unfamiliar customer. The unfamiliar customer noticed this and was unhappy, asking me, "Your meat thread soup is the same price, why is his thick and mine thin?" This question really stumped me. There were similar incidents.

At that time, I felt very uncomfortable. I thought, now the food hall is a socialist food hall, serving the broad masses. Chairman Mao often teaches us to serve the people wholeheartedly. Why don't we follow his words? I asked the cook, "Why do you serve some people well and others poorly?" He seemed to have a good reason, saying, "Some people are familiar faces from the neighborhood. These people had money in the old society and have eaten good food. If you serve them poorly, they can taste the difference. People from the countryside don't know much, they can't taste the difference between good and bad." Hearing this, I was so angry that I almost exploded. Why can't farmers taste the difference? Isn't this clearly looking down on and bullying farmers? Another time, two customers came to the food hall. The cook immediately came out to greet them and even brewed them a pot of tea, preparing their meals carefully. Who were these two people, and why were they treated so warmly? Upon inquiry, it turned out that one was a historical counter-revolutionary released by the government, and the other was a landlord. Upon hearing that these two were such people, I naturally connected the unreasonable incidents that had occurred in the food hall with this incident. Why, just a few days ago, did a rural woman, after eating in the food hall, go to the kitchen door to get a bowl of noodle soup, only to be pushed aside by the department head, saying, "Go away, go away, you're in the way!" Obviously, this was not just a matter of familiarity. This was about whom the food hall was serving. Who exactly was it serving?

That evening at the meeting, I questioned the cook and the department head, "Why are you so enthusiastic in serving counter-revolutionaries and landlords, but you won't even let a rural woman get a bowl of noodle soup? Who are you serving?" At that time, the cook reluctantly admitted that he lacked understanding. But he and the department head held a grudge against me from then on.

Later, whenever I encountered such problems, I would bring them to the table, giving them advice while reporting to the Party branch. At that time, some people thought these problems were minor and criticized me, saying, "You always make it a matter of principle." At that time, I felt that these problems were indeed matters of principle, but I couldn't explain why. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle seriously and further realized that even a small food hall has class struggle. The incidents that occurred in our food hall were a reflection of class struggle. The Party branch also supported me and criticized the department head and the cook. Standing Firm Against the Wrong Trends and Suppressing the Evil Waves

Xifeng Town is a rural market town, and most of the people who come to the food hall to eat are farmers who come to the market or deliver grain. Many farmers prefer to eat plain noodles, and I sold a lot of them. Our department head then told me, "When someone wants to eat noodles, you should recommend fried noodles or coarse noodles, not plain noodles; if they want vegetables, you should recommend expensive ones, not cheap ones." I didn't listen to him. One day, he asked me, "How much money did you make today?" I reported the amount. He said, "You only sell plain noodles, how much money can you make? How will you complete the task?" I said, "Plain noodles are regulated by the higher authorities to be sold, and farmers want to eat plain noodles, so we should enthusiastically serve them. Why don't you want to sell them?" Seeing my firm attitude, he knew he was in the wrong and changed his tone, saying, "Sell them, but sell less." In reality, he still didn't want to sell them.

Many farmers who come to the market or deliver grain have walked a long way and, after eating in the food hall, like to drink more noodle soup. Therefore, as long as the farmers ask for it, I would serve them. Our department head, however, was unwilling. I thought, serving the farmers a bowl of noodle soup is also serving the people, and I must insist on doing it. Because the department head had serious capitalist management ideas, I always encountered various difficulties. Some farmers wanted noodle soup, but the department head deceived them, saying, "The pot is not boiling." I watched him lie, and I was really angry. I criticized him, but he didn't listen. I reported this problem all the way to the prefectural level. The higher authorities, upon receiving the letter, paid great attention to it, sent people to investigate the situation, and thoroughly solved the problem.

Through a series of struggles, my class consciousness was further raised. Whenever I encountered such situations, no matter how unhappy the department head was, I insisted on doing it. As these incidents happened more frequently, the department head's attitude towards me became worse and worse. He often scolded me fiercely. I also retorted without hesitation, "If what you say is right, I will listen. If what you say does not align with the Party's interests or the people's interests, I will not listen." The meals we served in the food hall, he ate whatever he wanted. I criticized him, but he didn't care and even spread among the staff, saying, "Those who work in restaurants are just for eating and drinking." After work, he also lectured some staff members on bad novels like "The Case of Judge Bao." This made me see even more clearly that the department head was a person who insisted on the capitalist road, and in his mind, there were no words like "serving the people." The more they disliked me, the more this place needed me.

My struggle against the department head made him even more furious. He adopted methods of ridicule and attack, deliberately harassing me and forcing me to leave the food hall. He spread among the comrades, saying, "The leadership often criticizes our food hall for being poorly managed, and it's all because of Wang Qiaofeng's reports. She just knows how to curry favor with the higher authorities." He also gave me some nicknames, such as "Wang Politics," "Wang Principles," "Wang Policies," "Wang Secretary," and so on. At that time, I felt very uncomfortable. Later, following Chairman Mao's teachings, I thought it through: I am a Communist Party member, and I should have politics, principles, and act according to the Party's policies. His ridicule and mockery only show that I am right. Seeing that this method didn't work, the department head tried another way to strike at me. He adopted the method of giving me less bread and less fried dough twists, framing me for embezzlement, and forcing me to make a self-criticism at a public meeting. However, I was not intimidated by their persecution.

It was during this period of intense struggle that some well-meaning colleagues advised me, "Qiaofeng, as the saying goes, the more you meddle in other people's business, the more enemies you make. You are a temporary worker, why do you have to raise so many issues?" My father-in-law also advised me, "In the future, raise fewer issues." At that time, I couldn't eat or sleep well, and I had a lot on my mind. I initially had the thought of not provoking people anymore. But I am a Communist Party member, and my work is for the Party and the people. Our revolutionary predecessors and martyrs, in their struggles against the enemy, shed blood and sacrificed their lives. How could I retreat in the face of such difficulties? I also thought, in the old society, I lost my father at the age of three, and my family suffered from hunger and cold. The landlords and village heads even pressed us for debts and rent, making life very difficult. Now I am the master of the country and a Communist Party member. For the sake of the Party and the people's interests, how could I be afraid to raise issues and provoke people? Some well-meaning people also found me another job and advised me to leave the food hall to avoid being bullied every day. I thought, a Communist Party member should, as Chairman Mao taught, "treat revolutionary interests as the first priority and subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests." The class struggle here is very sharp, how could I leave this battlefield? Thinking of this, I said, "The more they dislike me, the more this place needs me. No matter how difficult it is, I will stand firm and not go anywhere."

In this intense class struggle, I needed Chairman Mao's guidance so much! Chairman Mao would definitely tell me what to do. I first reread the article "Being Opposed by the Enemy is a Good Thing, Not a Bad Thing." This made me even more certain that my insistence on struggling with them was correct. The department head's strong opposition to me proved that he was guilty and had done things that could not be seen. It proved that my struggle was successful. I also read "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," realizing that my struggle with them was a struggle between two ideologies and two roads. If we did not struggle, and let these bad ideas develop, our socialist cause would be harmed. Chairman Mao's books pointed out the direction of my struggle and strengthened my will to struggle. I made up my mind that no matter how strong the wrong trends and high the evil waves were, I would stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint and fight to the end with these bourgeois ideas and behaviors. Unite the Masses to Struggle Together

In the process of struggle, it was not surprising that those with serious bourgeois ideas ridiculed and mocked me. But why did some comrades sometimes agree with them? I analyzed the staff of the food hall according to Chairman Mao's teachings: one type of person had serious bourgeois ideas, such as the department head; the second type was contract workers from the countryside. They had good backgrounds, worked hard, but were afraid to cause trouble and did not raise issues about who was good or bad; another type was young people. They had high work enthusiasm and dared to speak, but they lacked guidance and were easily influenced by bourgeois ideas. After analyzing these three types of people, I realized that the latter two types were good comrades, and I should unite them to firmly struggle against those who insisted on the capitalist road.

But why were they not united well? To solve this problem, I studied Chairman Mao's articles such as "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War." Chairman Mao said in this article, "The idea that only oneself is good and others are no good is completely wrong." Chairman Mao also said, "The attitude of the Communist Party members towards backward people is not to look down on them or despise them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." Chairman Mao's words really pointed out my shortcomings. Later, I cared for and cherished my comrades in various ways, especially caring for them politically. I brought Chairman Mao's works and the newspapers I subscribed to the food hall and studied and discussed with everyone during free time. When some comrades were sick, I made sick meals for them every day. When some comrades' work clothes were dirty, I took the time to wash them. This way, comrades gradually got closer to me. Under the education of the Party organization, comrades' awareness generally improved. They gradually saw through the serious mistakes of the department head and realized that our struggle with him was a struggle between two ideologies and two roads. Thus, everyone actively criticized and struggled against the bourgeois management ideas represented by the department head.

Under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the help of comrades, I did a little work for the people. But I am still far from the Party's and the people's requirements for me. I must read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I will be a good student of Chairman Mao, as Comrade Lei Feng said, to dedicate my limited life to the endless service for the people.

    在阶级斗争风浪中顶天立地站起来
    甘肃庆阳县饮食服务商店第一食堂门市部　王巧凤
    一九六四年三月，我到甘肃省庆阳县西峰镇第五食堂当临时工。当时我想，党培养我好多年，我一定要听党的话，全心全意为人民服务；另一方面，我又觉得食堂工作是个粗活、笨活，只要把生的做成熟的，做得好好的，端给顾客就行了，没有什么难办的。小食堂里也有阶级斗争
    可是，事实并不是这样。我一进食堂，就发现了许多看不惯的现象。例如我们门市部的主任和厨师，对顾客总是两样看待：熟人一个样，生人又一个样。熟人来了，做的饭菜质量好；生人来了，做的饭菜质量差。他们还指点我把质量好的菜端给熟人，差的菜端给生人。一天，有两位顾客，同时来了，同样叫的肉丝汤。厨师给熟顾客的汤放肉丝多，给生顾客放的少。这个生顾客发现了，很不高兴，就问我：“你们的肉丝汤一个价，为什么他的稠我的稀呢？”这一问可把我问住了。类似的事还有。
    当时，我心里很难受。我想，现在的食堂，是社会主义的食堂，是为广大群众服务的。毛主席经常教导我们，要全心全意为人民服务，我们为什么不按他老人家的话办呢？我就问这个厨师：“你为什么给有些人做得好，有些人做得不好呢？”他好像很有理地讲：“有些人是街道上的熟人，这些人在旧社会都有钱，吃过好饭，你给他做得不好，他能尝出来。农村里来的人不懂啥，好坏他也尝不出味道来。”听他这么一说，我的肺都快要气炸了。农民为啥尝不出味道？这不明明是看不起农民，欺负农民吗？又一次，食堂来了两个顾客，厨师马上出堂接待，还给他们泡了一壶茶，饭菜做得也挺好。这两个是什么人，为啥对他们招待得这么周到？一打听，才知道一个是被政府关押释放的历史反革命分子，一个是地主分子。一听说是这么两个家伙，我就很自然地把食堂里发生的一些不合理的现象和这件事联系到一起了。为什么前一两天，一个农村妇女在食堂吃罢饭，到厨房门前要盛一碗面汤，门市部主任却把人家推到一边，说“去去去，挡路绊脚的！”显然这并不是个熟人不熟人的问题。这是食堂为什么人服务的问题。究竟为什么人服务？
    这天晚上开会，我就对那个厨师和门市部主任提出质问：“为什么反革命分子、地主分子来了，你们招待得那么热情，为什么农村妇女要盛一碗面汤你们都不让？你们是为什么人服务的？”当时厨师勉强承认他认识不够。但他和门市部主任从此对我怀恨在心。
    以后，我碰到这类问题，就把它摆在桌面上，一边给他们提意见，一边反映给党支部。当时个别人觉得这些问题都是些小事，批评我：“动不动就是原则问题。”那时，我觉得这些问题的确是原则问题，但是也说不出什么道理来。后来我认真学习了毛主席有关阶级斗争的教导，才进一步认清了小小的食堂也有阶级斗争，我们食堂里发生的这些事正是阶级斗争的反映。党支部也支持我，批评了门市部主任和厨师。顶住歪风，压住恶浪
    西峰镇是一个农村集镇，来食堂吃饭的多半是赶集和送公粮的农民。不少农民愿意吃素面，我卖的素面多了，我们的主任就对我说，“有人要吃面时，你就介绍炒面、稍子面，不要介绍素面；要吃菜，你就介绍贵菜，不要介绍便宜菜。”我没听他的。有一天，他问我：“今天你卖了多少钱？”我就把钱报了一下。他说：“你光卖素面，能卖几个钱？任务完不成怎么办？”我说：“素面是上级规定让卖的，农民愿意吃素面，我们就应该热情地接待他们。你为什么不让卖？”他见我态度坚决，自知理屈，就改口说：“卖还是卖，少卖一点就行了。”实际上他还是不想卖。
    许多农民赶集送粮，走了远路，到食堂吃罢饭，喜欢多喝些面汤。因此，只要农民要，我就给他们端。我们的主任可不愿意。我想，给农民端碗面汤，这也是为人民服务，我要坚持端下去。因为门市部主任有严重的资本主义经营思想，我总是碰到这样或那样的难题。有的农民要面汤，门市部主任就欺骗农民说：“锅没开。”我眼睁睁地看着他说谎，心里实在气愤。我批评他，他根本不听。我就把这个问题一直反映到专员那里，上级接到信后，十分重视，派人调查了情况，彻底解决了这个问题。
    通过一连串的斗争，我的阶级觉悟也进一步提高了。凡是遇到这些情况，不管主任怎么不高兴，我还是坚持做。这样的事情发生的多了，门市部主任对我的态度越来越坏。他经常恶狠狠地训斥我。我也毫不客气地回敬他：“你说得对我听，你说得不符合党的利益、不符合人民的利益，我就不听。”我们食堂里营业的饭菜，他想吃什么就吃什么。我批评他，他也满不在乎，还在职工中散布说：“干饭馆的就是为了吃吃喝喝。”下了班，他还给一些职工大讲“包公案”等坏小说。这样一来，我更加看清了门市部主任是一个坚持走资本主义道路的人，在他脑子里根本没有“为人民服务”五个字。他们越不喜欢我，说明这里越需要我
    我对门市部主任所做的针锋相对的斗争，使他越来越恼火。他采取了讽刺、打击的办法，故意整我，逼我离开这个食堂。他在同志们中间散布说：“领导上经常批评我们食堂办的不好，都是王巧凤反映的，她就知道向上级讨好。”并给我起了些绰号，什么“王政治”、“王原则”、“王政策”、“王书记”，等等。当时我听了很不舒服。后来按照毛主席的教导一想，就想通了：我是一个共产党员，我就是要有政治，就是要有原则，就是要按党的政策办事。他讽刺我，挖苦我，正说明我是做对了。门市部主任看见采取这种办法不行，就又想用别的方法打击我。他又采取少给我发馍、少发麻花的办法陷害我，向上级反映我有贪污行为，硬逼着我在大会上作检查。但是，我并没有被他们这种迫害吓倒。
    也就在这一段斗争激烈的日子里，有些好心的职工劝我说：“巧凤，俗话说，管得闲事多，惹得人多。你是个临时工，提那么多意见干啥？”我的公公也劝我“以后少提些意见”。这时，我吃也吃不好，睡也睡不好，想的事情很多。开始我也产生过再不要多惹人的念头。可是，自己是个共产党员，干工作是为党为人民。我们的革命前辈和先烈们，同敌人斗争中，流血牺牲，生命都不顾，我遇到这么一点困难就打退堂鼓吗？我又想，在旧社会我三岁就死了爹，家里少吃没穿，地主、保长还逼债逼租，日子真难过呀。现在我是国家的主人，是共产党员，为了党和人民的利益，同走资本主义道路的人作斗争，怎么能怕提意见，怕惹人呢？还有的好心人给我另外找了工作，劝我离开食堂，省得整天受“窝囊气”。我想，一个共产党员，应该像毛主席教导的那样“以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。这个地方阶级斗争很尖锐，我能离开这个阵地吗？想到这里，我说：“他们越不喜欢我，说明这个地方越需要我。再困难，也要顶住，我哪里也不去。”
    在这激烈的阶级斗争中，我是多么需要毛主席指点呀！毛主席一定能告诉我应该怎么办。我首先重读了《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》这篇文章。这样我更加肯定了自己坚持同他们斗争是对的。门市部主任起劲地反对我，证明他作贼心虚，干下了见不得人的事，证明我斗争是有成绩的。我又读了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，认识到我和他们的斗争，是两种思想、两条道路的斗争，如果不斗争，任这些坏思想发展下去，我们的社会主义事业就会受到损害。毛主席的书给我指明了斗争的方向，坚定了我的斗争意志。我下定决心，不管歪风再大，恶浪再高，也要站稳无产阶级立场，也要和这些资产阶级的思想和行为斗到底。团结群众一起斗争
    在斗争的过程中，那些资产阶级思想严重的人挖苦我，讽刺我，并不奇怪。但为什么有些同志有时候也附和着他们？我又按照毛主席的教导，对食堂的职工进行了分析：一种人是有严重的资产阶级思想的人，例如门市部主任；第二种人，是从农村来的合同工，他们出身好，工作肯干，就是怕惹事，谁好谁坏都不提意见；再一种人，就是些年青人，他们工作热情高，也敢说话，只是对他们帮助少，容易受到资产阶级思想的影响。分析了这三种人以后，我认识到，既然后两种人都是好同志，就应该团结他们，一起同坚持走资本主义道路的人坚决斗下去。
    那么为什么没有把他们团结好呢？为了解决这个问题，我又学习了毛主席《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》等文章。毛主席在这篇文章中说：“那种以为只有自己好、别人都不行的想法，是完全不对的。”毛主席又说：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”毛主席的话真说到我的毛病上了。后来我就从各方面关心和体贴同志，特别是从政治上关心他们，把毛主席著作和自己订的报纸带到食堂，有空就和大家一起学、一起议。有的同志病了，我天天给他做病号饭，有些同志的工作服脏了，我就抽空给他们洗。这样一来，同志们慢慢就和我接近了。在党组织的教育下，同志们的认识普遍提高了，他们逐渐认清了门市部主任的严重错误，认清了我们同他之间的斗争是两种思想、两条道路的斗争，于是，大家积极起来对以门市部主任为代表的资产阶级经营思想进行了批判和斗争。
    在党和毛主席的教导下，在同志们的帮助下，我为人民做了一点工作。可是离党和人民对我的要求还差得很远，我一定要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生，像雷锋同志所说的，把自己有限的生命，投入到无限的为人民服务中去。
