Millions of farmers across the country have enthusiastically responded to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to learn from Dazhai in agriculture. The spirit of Dazhai has blossomed and borne fruit in the vast rural areas. A large number of Dazhai-style model units have emerged, and agricultural production has entered a new phase of leaps and bounds.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on September 24, the millions of farmers in our country have enthusiastically responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, launching a vigorous mass movement to learn from Dazhai. This has greatly promoted the ideological transformation of the people, allowing the spirit of Dazhai to take root, blossom, and bear fruit in the vast rural areas, powerfully promoting the development of agricultural production and construction.

Since Chairman Mao issued the great call to learn from Dazhai in agriculture, a mass movement to learn from Dazhai has gradually emerged across the country. In November last year, the capital held a grand national exhibition of Dazhai-style agricultural models. Subsequently, various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions also held similar exhibitions. Many counties and people's communes organized propaganda teams to use storytelling, lantern slides, and other art forms to widely and deeply propagate the advanced deeds of Dazhai Brigade and many Dazhai-style model units to the masses. Through these activities, the spirit of Dazhai gradually spread to the plains and mountainous areas, the interior and the border regions, becoming known to every household. Thus, Chairman Mao's great call to learn from Dazhai in agriculture has been deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Learning from Dazhai, aspiring to be like Dazhai, and following the path of Dazhai have become a vigorous mass movement enthusiastically participated in by millions of farmers and rural cadres.

The spirit of Dazhai is a product of arming rural masses and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought. To truly learn from the spirit of Dazhai, local cadres and farmers have seriously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. People say that Dazhai's experience can be listed in dozens or even hundreds of items, but the most important and fundamental one is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seriously read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. To learn from Dazhai's experience, one must first learn this point. Shanghai's suburban areas, one of the national Dazhai-style advanced regions, with more than 190 communes, have taken Dazhai as an example, placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. This has greatly promoted the ideological transformation of the people, thereby rapidly advancing the development of production and construction.

In the process of promoting the learning from Dazhai movement, various places have paid great attention to learning from the Dazhai people's unyielding commitment to the socialist path, their broad vision, their emphasis on the collective, and their dedication to farming for the revolution. "To build Dazhai fields, one must first become a Dazhai person," this is the common experience of many grassroots cadres and commune members. In recent years, Dazhai's experience has been rapidly promoted in mountainous areas, and this year it has quickly spread to the plains. Famous regions such as the Pearl River Basin, Jianghan Plain, Yangtze River Delta, and Sichuan Basin have this year combined the learning of Dazhai's experience with the promotion of local experiences, significantly promoting agricultural increases. Farmers in these regions summarize their learning of Dazhai's experience: "Fields rely on people to cultivate, and people rely on ideology. Once the ideology is transformed, the fields will definitely be well cultivated." In North China, Northeast, and Southwest regions, which were originally relatively backward in production, the learning from Dazhai movement has begun to catch up. Some communes and production teams in Shanxi and Liaoning provinces have seriously learned from Dazhai's experience, under the premise of emphasizing politics and leading in ideology, improved management systems, greatly mobilized the commune members' consciousness to farm for the revolution, and promoted the further consolidation and development of the people's commune collective economy.

Learning from Dazhai has also effectively promoted the ideological transformation of rural cadres, producing more cadres who can emphasize politics, closely connect with the masses, and skillfully lead production in their work. This year, the number of cadres who have gone to the production frontline to conduct in-depth investigations, participated in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and led the three great revolutionary movements is more than in any previous year. Due to the large number of cadres entering the countryside and focusing on political and ideological work, successful experiences such as raising red flags, setting up model workers; one helps one, one pair of red; one leads two, a piece of red; inviting in and sending out have been widely promoted. This has greatly promoted the enthusiasm of the masses to learn from Dazhai, making new Dazhai-style model units emerge in large numbers and gradually increasing the number of large-scale Dazhai-style units. At the same time, the original Dazhai-style advanced units are also making great strides forward.

Through the mass learning from Dazhai movement, the spirit of Dazhai has taken root, blossomed, and borne fruit in local areas, transforming into a great material force, bringing a new leap to agricultural production. Last winter and this spring, the number and quality of basic agricultural construction projects completed by various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions were the highest in recent years. A large number of low-lying, saline-alkali, and barren slopes have been transformed into fertile fields. The Wenjiang District of Sichuan Province has carried out large-scale soil improvement, transforming tens of thousands of acres of low-yield fields in one spring. Pingjiang County in Hunan Province has built a large number of waterwheel pump stations during the learning from Dazhai movement, improving the irrigation conditions in hilly and mountainous areas, and achieving good harvests for two consecutive years despite drought conditions. Hebei Province has expanded the area of irrigated land by more than 60 million mu after a winter and spring of efforts. Xiaoxincun Brigade of Xianxincun Commune in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, has learned from the Dazhai people's spirit of hard work and self-reliance in the "Three Battles of Wolf's Paw," without receiving a single penny of state subsidies, relying entirely on their own hands, fought five battles against the Jinsha River, built irrigation and drainage channels, transformed 800 mu of low-lying fields, opened up 300 mu of paddy fields, and turned more than 1,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. This year's summer crop yield has increased by 30% compared to last year.

The new achievements made in learning from Dazhai over the past year have once again forcefully proven that learning from Dazhai is a brilliant path to rapidly, efficiently, and economically develop agricultural production and build a new socialist countryside. The vast number of rural cadres and commune members across the country are determined to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the path indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao, and stride forward bravely to achieve one victory after another.

    亿万农民热烈响应毛主席关于农业学大寨的伟大号召
    大寨精神在广大农村开花结果
    大寨式的典型单位大量涌现，农业生产出现新的跃进局面
    据新华社二十四日讯 我国亿万农民热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，兴起了蓬蓬勃勃的群众性的学大寨运动，大大促进了人的思想革命化，使大寨精神在广大农村生根、开花、结果，有力地推动了农业生产建设事业的发展。
    自从毛主席发出农业学大寨的伟大号召以后，一个群众性的学大寨运动就在全国各地逐步兴起。去年十一月首都举行了规模盛大的全国大寨式农业典型展览；随后，各省、市、自治区也相继举办了内容大致相同的展览，许多县和人民公社还组织了宣传队，将大寨大队和许多大寨式典型单位的先进事迹，利用说唱、幻灯等文艺形式，广泛深入地向群众作宣传。通过这些活动，大寨精神逐步传遍平原和山区、内地和边疆，许多地区做到了家喻户晓。至此，毛主席的农业学大寨的伟大号召更加深入人心，学大寨人，立大寨志，走大寨路，成了亿万农民和农村干部积极参加的轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    大寨精神，是用毛泽东思想武装农民群众和农村干部的产物。各地干部和农民为了把大寨精神真正学到手，认真活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。人们说，大寨经验可以列出几十条、上百条，但最重要、最根本的一条，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。要学大寨经验，首先必须学习这一条。全国大寨式先进地区之一的上海郊区的一百九十多个公社，就是以大寨为榜样，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，大大促进了人的思想革命化，进而推动生产建设事业迅速发展的。
    各地在开展学大寨的运动中，都很重视学习大寨人那种坚定不移地走社会主义道路，胸怀全局，“公”字当头，为革命种田的崇高风格。“要建大寨田，先作大寨人”，这是许多基层干部和社员的共同体会。前几年，大寨经验在山区推广得快，今年在平原地区迅速普及。著名的珠江流域、江汉平原、长江三角洲、川西平原等地区，今年把学大寨经验和推广本地经验密切结合起来，对农业增产起了显著的促进作用。这些地区的农民总结学习大寨经验说：田靠人种，人靠思想，思想革命化了，田一定能种好。华北、东北和西南一些原来生产比较后进的地区，在学大寨运动中，开始赶上来了。山西、辽宁等省的一些社、队，认真学习大寨经验，在突出政治、思想领先的前提下，改进经营管理制度，大大地调动了社员为革命种田的自觉性，促进了人民公社集体经济的进一步巩固和发展。
    学大寨，也有效地促进了农村干部的思想革命化，涌现了更多的在工作中能够突出政治，密切联系群众，善于指挥生产的好干部。今年，到生产第一线蹲点，参加阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，领导三大革命运动的各级干部，比以往任何一年都多。由于大批干部深入农村，狠抓政治思想工作，普遍推广了插红旗，树标兵；一帮一，一对红；一带二，一片红；请进来，派出去等成功经验，大大促进了广大群众学大寨的积极性，使新的大寨式典型大量涌现，大面积的大寨式单位逐渐增多。同时，原有大寨式先进单位也在阔步前进。
    各地通过群众性的学大寨运动，使大寨精神在本地生根、开花、结果，转化成为巨大的物质力量，为农业生产带来了新的跃进。去冬今春，各省、市、自治区完成的农田基本建设工程，数量是近几年来最多的，质量是最好的，大量的洼地、碱地和荒坡被改造成良田。四川省温江专区大搞土壤改良，一春天就改造了几十万亩低产田。湖南省平江县在学大寨运动中大建水轮泵站，改善了丘陵山区的灌溉条件，连续两年在干旱情况下获得好收成。河北省经过一冬春的努力，扩大水浇地面积六百多万亩。陕西省长安县滦村公社小新村大队，学习大寨人三战狼窝掌的艰苦创业精神，不要国家一文补助费，全部靠自己的双手，五战金沙河，建成了能灌能排的渠道，改造了八百亩洼地，开辟了三百亩稻田，把一千多亩旱地改为水浇地，今年夏收作物产量比去年增加了三成。
    一年来，各地学大寨取得的新成就再次有力地证明，学大寨是多快好省地发展农业生产，建设社会主义新农村的光辉道路。全国广大农村干部和社员决心继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的道路，昂首阔步地奋勇前进，夺取一个又一个的新胜利。
