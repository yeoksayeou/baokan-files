The Indonesian right-wing military regime, acting in accordance with American intentions, has decided to rejoin the United Nations. It has dispatched its foreign minister, Adam Malik, to lead a delegation to the 21st session of the United Nations General Assembly, which opened on September 20. This is yet another move by the Indonesian right-wing military regime to align itself more closely with U.S. imperialism.

The Indonesian ambassador to the United States, B.M. Darmo, sent a telegram on September 19 to inform U.N. Secretary-General U Thant of this decision. The telegram stated that the Indonesian right-wing military regime has decided to "resume full cooperation with the United Nations" starting from the 21st session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    印尼右派军人政权倒行逆施
    宣布印尼重新回到联合国
    据新华社二十日讯  纽约消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权秉承美国的意旨，决定重新回到联合国，并派出它的外交部长马利克率领代表团出席二十日开幕的第二十一届联合国大会。这是印度尼西亚右派军人政权进一步投靠美帝国主义的又一个行动。
    印尼驻美国大使巴拉十九日将这一决定打电报通知了联合国秘书长吴丹。电报表示印度尼西亚右派军人政权决定从第二十一届联合国大会开始“恢复同联合国的全面合作”。
