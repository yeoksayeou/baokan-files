The third batch of Japanese Socialist Party activists visiting China delegation, with boundless respect for Chairman Mao, visited Shaoshan on August 31.

The Japanese friends visited Mao Zedong's former residence and, after touring the Mao Zedong Former Residence Exhibition Hall, were deeply moved. They said, "Chairman Mao devoted his entire life to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and the people of the world. His family sacrificed six members for the revolution, truly a great revolutionary family, demonstrating Chairman Mao's great communist spirit and internationalist spirit." They deeply understood from the arduous history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle that the victory of the Chinese revolution is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, they love Mao Zedong Thought even more. One Japanese friend said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the treasure of revolution for the oppressed and exploited people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought gives courage, strength, and confidence to the Japanese people who are opposing American imperialism and domestic reactionaries."

A Japanese friend who was originally a coal miner wrote in the guestbook: "Visiting Shaoshan, I not only saw the greatness of Mao Zedong Thought but also touched the soul of serving the people wholeheartedly. In the current difficult struggle of the Mitsui Coal Mine, Mao Zedong Thought has given me new encouragement, making me aware of the absolute task of revolution." Another Japanese friend who was originally a coal miner wrote: "Study the great Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow American imperialism, overthrow domestic reactionaries, overthrow revisionism, long live Mao Zedong Thought!" Four Japanese friends, at the suggestion of the team leader Yamamoto Yutaro, wrote down their own oaths. Yamamoto Yutaro said, "Mao Zedong Thought is an inexhaustible source. We will return to northern, central, and southern Japan and use the Mao Zedong Thought we learned in China in the struggles in Japan, serving the revolution wholeheartedly." Another Japanese friend excitedly said, "I swear here that I will stand at the forefront of the workers and peasants, resolutely fight against American imperialism, long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!"

    伟大毛泽东思想是革命的法宝
    给日本人民以勇气力量和信心
    日本朋友访问韶山后表示更加热爱毛主席
    新华社长沙九日电　第三批日本社会党活动家访华代表团，怀着对毛主席无限崇敬的心情，在八月三十一日，访问了韶山。
    日本朋友访问了毛主席的旧居，参观了毛主席旧居陈列馆以后很感动地说：“毛主席把一生的精力都贡献给了中国人民和世界人民的革命事业，他的一家为了革命牺牲了六人，真是伟大的革命家庭，表现了毛主席伟大的共产主义精神和国际主义精神。”他们从中国人民革命斗争的艰苦历程中，深刻认识到中国革命的胜利就是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。因此，他们更加热爱毛泽东思想。一位日本朋友说：“毛泽东思想是全世界被压迫被剥削人民革命的法宝。毛泽东思想给予反对美帝国主义和国内反动派的日本人民以勇气、力量和信心。”
    一位煤矿工人出身的日本朋友在留言簿上写道：“访问韶山，不仅看到了毛泽东思想的伟大，而且接触了全心全意为人民服务的灵魂。在今天相当困难的三池煤矿的斗争中，毛泽东思想给了我新的鼓励，使我觉悟到了革命的绝对的任务。”另一位煤矿工人出身的日本朋友写道：“学习伟大的毛泽东思想，打倒美帝国主义，打倒国内反动派，打倒修正主义，毛泽东思想万岁！”有四位日本朋友在团长山本勇太郎的提议下，写下了各自的誓言。山本勇太郎说：“毛泽东思想是用之不尽的源泉，我们回到日本的北部，中部，南部，要把在中国学到的毛泽东思想，用于日本的斗争中去，全心全意为革命服务。”还有一位日本朋友激动地说：“我在这里宣誓，我要站在工农战线的最前面，坚决和美帝国主义作斗争，伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”
