Only by connecting with thought can one study well. Studying Chairman Mao's works, regardless of one's level of education, one must study and apply them actively to truly learn. Before enlisting, I was an elementary school teacher, and now I am a new soldier. Through practice, I have deeply understood this point. When I was teaching, I had studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," but I mainly did so to prepare lessons for my students and did not pay attention to using it to transform my own thoughts. Therefore, while I was teaching others about "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I myself was not content with being a teacher. After coming to the company, my comrades helped me overcome the bad habit of separating study from practice, and my studies made progress.

One day, I could have rested, but I saw that the class had a heavy workload, so I went to help. The platoon leader saw that I was working slowly and scolded me a few times. I thought that I was doing "extra" work and still got scolded, which made me a bit aggrieved. In the evening, the platoon leader came to me with "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to make an apology. He said: he lacked enthusiasm in helping his comrades and should not have gotten angry with me. This touched me deeply. The platoon leader's education level is not high, but why can he quickly resolve small problems? The main reason is that he actively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works, and can transform his thoughts according to Chairman Mao's instructions. I decided to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works like the platoon leader. Through studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I consciously examined and criticized my "extra" thoughts. I understood that serving the people has no "within one's duty" or "beyond one's duty." Whatever revolutionary work the Party and the people need, one should do it, and do it well. Later, through continuous active study and application, and continuous self-examination of my thoughts, my attitude towards serving the people gradually became correct.

I have realized that studying Chairman Mao's works, if one only reads the words without thinking, without connecting with one's own thoughts, then studying is as good as nothing. Only by firmly grasping the key of active study and application can one continuously draw treasures from the great treasure house of Mao Zedong Thought, arm one's mind, and become a revolutionary with a red heart and bright eyes.

    只有联系思想才能学好
    战士　苏宝贤
    学习毛主席著作，不分文化高低，都得活学活用才能学好。我参军前是个小学教员，现在是个新兵，通过实践对这点体会很深。我教学时，学习过《为人民服务》，但那主要是为了给学生讲课，并不注意用来改造自己的思想。因此，一边给人家讲《为人民服务》，一边自己不安心当教员。来到连队后，大家帮助我克服了学用脱节的坏毛病，学习有了进步。
    有一天，本来我可以休息，我见班里工作任务很重，就去帮忙。班长看我干得慢，就批评了我几句。我认为自己干的是“份外”工作，还挨批评，有些委屈。晚上，班长拿着《为人民服务》向我做检讨来了。他说：他对同志缺乏热情帮助的态度，他不应该对我发脾气。这使我很受感动。班长文化不高，为啥有点小问题很快就能解决呢？主要是他对毛主席著作活学活用得好，能够照毛主席的指示改造自己的思想。我决心要像班长那样活学活用毛主席著作。我通过学习《为人民服务》，自觉地检查批判了“份外”的思想。懂得了为人民服务根本没有什么“份内”“份外”，凡是党和人民需要的革命工作，自己都应该去干，干就要干好。以后又经过不断的活学活用，不断的对照检查自己的思想，我为人民服务的态度就逐步端正起来。
    我体会到：学习毛主席著作，光看字，不想事，不联系自己的思想，学了，也等于零。只有紧紧握住活学活用这把金钥匙，才能不断地在毛泽东思想的大宝库里取宝，武装自己的头脑，做个心红眼亮的革命者。
