	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people to their very souls. It is an all-out class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, a life-and-death struggle between the reactionary line and the revolutionary line. In this great revolution, we must thoroughly criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities" and their reactionary bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" and their reactionary bourgeois ideological bastions, and uproot the poisonous weeds that have been deeply rooted in people's minds for thousands of years, so that the proletariat can seize the command of the superstructure, including all cultural fields such as ideology, education, literature, art, and publishing, and establish proletarian hegemony in the superstructure.
