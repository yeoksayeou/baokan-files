Chinese Foreign Ministry officials today urgently summoned the Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires in response to the Indonesian government's unreasonable rejection and obstruction of Chinese consular officials' efforts to travel to Medan to organize and arrange for the return of affected overseas Chinese. The officials pointed out that the Chinese government is extremely indignant at the Indonesian government's disregard for international trust and violation of international norms. The Indonesian government must bear full responsibility for disrupting China's efforts to repatriate its citizens.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry official stated that the first Chinese repatriation ship will soon arrive at the port of Medan. The Chinese government had previously notified the Indonesian government in two notes dated September 5 and 12 that it had decided to send consular officials and necessary personnel to Medan to organize and arrange for the return of affected overseas Chinese, and to manage the Chinese government's specially dispatched repatriation ships. Chinese Foreign Ministry officials and officials from the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia had conducted multiple negotiations with the Indonesian Embassy in China and the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on this matter. However, the Indonesian government repeatedly created obstacles and delays. After repeated urgings from the Chinese side, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry finally agreed on September 17 to allow one vice-consul to go to Medan, but continued to obstruct other personnel from going. The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia had submitted a note to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, stating that the embassy had decided to immediately send the vice-consul along with one interpreter to Medan, while also requesting that the Indonesian government promptly arrange for other consular officials to go to Medan.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry official pointed out that on September 20, the Indonesian Foreign Ministry suddenly handed over a memorandum to the Chinese Embassy, arbitrarily rejecting the Chinese consular officials' travel to Medan and, in a reversal, withdrawing its previous agreement to allow the vice-consul to go to Medan. The Indonesian government's sudden change of stance, rejecting the consular officials and necessary personnel sent by the Chinese Embassy to Medan, is a serious act of depriving Chinese consular officials of their right to perform their normal duties. It also fully proves that the Indonesian government is determined to disrupt the Chinese government's efforts to repatriate affected overseas Chinese and further deteriorate relations between the two countries.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry official said that a large number of affected overseas Chinese have been forced to Medan by the Indonesian government, where they are homeless, destitute, and suffering greatly, urgently awaiting Chinese consular officials to go there to handle visa procedures and organize their return to China.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry official finally handed over a memorandum to the Indonesian Chargé d'Affaires, demanding that the Indonesian government immediately change its unreasonable attitude and promptly arrange for Chinese consular officials and necessary personnel to go to Medan.

    我外交部负责官员紧急召见印尼临时代办
    印尼政府必须承担破坏中国接侨的一切责任
    无理阻挠我领事官员履行正常职务证明印尼政府决心进一步恶化两国关系
    新华社二十一日讯　中国外交部负责官员今天就印度尼西亚政府无理拒绝并阻挠中国领事官员前往棉兰组织和安排受害华侨回国的严重事件紧急召见了印度尼西亚驻华大使馆临时代办，并指出，中国政府对于印度尼西亚政府不顾国际信义、违反国际关系准则的做法表示十分愤慨，印度尼西亚政府必须承担破坏中国接侨工作的一切责任。
    中国外交部负责官员说，中国第一艘接侨船只日内即将抵达棉兰港口。中国政府早在九月五日和十二日的两次照会中通知印度尼西亚政府，中国政府决定派遣领事官员及必要的工作人员前往棉兰组织和安排受害华侨返国，并照料中国政府专门派出的接侨船只。中国外交部负责官员和中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆官员曾就此事同印度尼西亚驻华大使馆和印度尼西亚外交部分别进行了多次的交涉。印度尼西亚政府却一再进行刁难和阻挠。经中国方面一再催促，最后，印度尼西亚外交部在九月十七日同意副领事一人去棉兰，但仍然阻挠其他人员前往。中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆曾向印度尼西亚外交部提出照会，大使馆决定先派副领事偕译员一名立即前往棉兰，同时要求印度尼西亚政府尽速安排其他领事官员前往棉兰。
    中国外交部负责官员指出，九月二十日，印度尼西亚外交部突然递交一份备忘录给中国大使馆，悍然拒绝中国领事官员前往棉兰，而且出尔反尔，竟然收回了它自己在九月十七日所表示的同意副领事前往棉兰的诺言。印度尼西亚政府的这种突然作法，拒绝中国大使馆派出的领事官员和必要的工作人员前往棉兰，是剥夺中国领事馆官员履行正常职务的权利的严重行为。也充分证明印度尼西亚政府决心破坏中国政府派船接运受害华侨回国和进一步恶化两国关系。
    中国外交部负责官员说，大批受害华侨被印度尼西亚政府赶到棉兰，他们流离失所，生活无着，处于水深火热之中，急待中国领事官员前往办理签证手续和组织他们回国。
    中国外交部负责官员最后向印度尼西亚临时代办提交了一份备忘录，严正要求印度尼西亚政府立即改变这种无理态度，迅速安排中国领事官员和必要的工作人员前往棉兰。
