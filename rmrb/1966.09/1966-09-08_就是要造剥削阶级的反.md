A great storm of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is sweeping through the land, overturning mountains and covering the sky! A large number of revolutionary youth have taken up their heavy clubs and struck down all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, leaving them in disarray and in ruins. We are determined to create a new world for the proletariat. "The tempest falls from the sky for me," this is truly unprecedented exhilaration!

However, those bourgeois gentlemen, after being shocked and frightened, cannot help but hide in the corners, whispering and complaining that we have "invaded" their "freedom."

Bourgeois gentlemen, what kind of freedom do you want? We, a group of orphans, beggars, maids, and child laborers from the old society, have today, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, become people's warriors, female pilots, revolutionary cadres, and people's representatives. We were born in bitter waters and grew up in sweet waters, deeply understanding the meaning of freedom and deeply understanding how our freedom was obtained. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a society of class struggle, if the exploiting class has the freedom to exploit the laboring people, then the laboring people do not have the freedom not to be exploited." We proletarians and laboring people have no common language with you bourgeois gentlemen; everything is incompatible. Your paradise of freedom for the exploiting class is precisely our hell of suffering. In the old society, you exploiting classes could do whatever you wanted; you sat on the necks of the laboring people, defecating and urinating, sucking their marrow. While we laboring people, those who grew grain had no food to eat, those who grew cotton and wove cloth had no clothes to wear, and those who burned bricks to build houses had no shelter. In your view, this was natural and beyond doubt. But in our view as laboring people, this was unreasonable and had to be overturned. Therefore, peasants and workers must rise up in rebellion, rebelling against all exploiting classes. Take us women, for example: in the old society, we broad masses of laboring women were tightly bound by the four great ropes of political power, clan power, divine power, and husband power, serving only as cattle, horses, and playthings for the exploiting class, with no freedom to be human. We laboring people think this is unreasonable and want to cut and break free from these four great ropes, fighting for our freedom and liberation.

Laughable bourgeois gentlemen, let me tell you frankly, in the past, freedom was yours, but now it is ours. Our freedom is gained through revolution and rebellion. The proletariat's revolution is to rebel against the bourgeoisie, to deprive the exploiting classes of their freedom. That's the way it is. If we do not deprive you, these ghosts and snakes of counter-revolutionaries, of your freedom, you will double your exploitation of ours. If we do not rebel against you exploiting classes, you will rebel against us, the proletariat.

Facts have proven that only under the red sun of Mao Zedong Thought, with thorough revolution and thorough rebellion, can the laboring people have freedom, and laboring women have freedom. Today, we women and all laboring people have completely stood up, truly free. We female pilots, in the old society, were all from humble backgrounds, with not even the freedom to live. It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who rescued us from the sea of suffering, leading us to make revolution and rebel against the exploiting classes, thus gaining today's freedom. To achieve our common revolutionary goals, we have come together from all corners of the country, and our shared class fate has made us sisters of the blue sky. Mao Zedong Thought has given us wings, guiding us to soar freely in the blue sky of our motherland! We see our motherland changing daily, with people changing their minds and the landscape transforming. We are no longer just circling around the stove, but for the defense of our motherland and for the world revolution, we circle around the globe!

Today, we have the freedom to serve the people and struggle for the revolution, the freedom to participate in state affairs, express opinions, and write articles, the freedom to study and master Mao Zedong Thought, the freedom to wield the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to sweep away all ghosts and snakes. All these freedoms are gained by rebelling against you exploiting classes and depriving you of your counter-revolutionary freedom under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Of course, you will never willingly leave the stage of history. You are always plotting to restore capitalism, attempting to regain your lost paradise of freedom. Haven't you been shouting in your dreams that only you should have the freedom to spread poison, and we should not have the freedom to counterattack? If your plots to usurp the party, the army, and the government succeed, and you seize power, you will "freely" behead us, suck our blood, and cast us into the eighteenth layer of hell. Let me tell you, bourgeois gentlemen, do not harbor such illusions; this will never happen.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, and in the great revolutionary storm, soar through the skies, wiping out all ideologies of the exploiting classes. Listen, all exploiting classes: we are determined to rebel against you. Only the proletarian revolution has the right to rebel, and the exploiting classes have no right to cause trouble. Rebellion is justified; this is the Marxist truth. You may like it or not, but you must listen. Here, there is absolutely no "freedom" for you!

    就是要造剥削阶级的反
    女飞行员　于富兰　诸惠芬　田树娥　沈学媛　于志岭　孙玉兰
    好一场无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨，正在排山倒海，铺天盖地而来！一大批革命青少年，抡起千钧棒，把一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，打得人仰马翻，落花流水，硬是要打出一个无产阶级的新世界来。“狂飙为我从天落”，这真是从来没有过的痛快！
    但是，那些资产阶级老爷们，在丧魂落魄之余，终不免躲在暗角里嘁嘁喳喳，认为我们是“侵犯”了他们的“自由”了。
    资产阶级老爷们，你们想要什么自由？我们这一群旧社会里的孤儿、乞丐、丫头、童工，今天，在毛泽东思想哺育下，变成了人民战士、女飞行员、革命干部、人民代表。我们都是苦水里生，甜水里长的，深深懂得自由的含义，深深懂得我们的自由是怎么得来的。毛主席教导我们：“在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。”我们无产阶级、劳动人民和你们资产阶级老爷们之间没有半句共同语言，一切的一切都是水火不相容的。你们剥削阶级的自由天堂，正是我们劳动人民的苦难地狱。在旧社会里，你们剥削阶级想怎么干就怎么干，你们骑在劳动人民脖子上拉屎撒尿，敲骨吸髓；而我们劳动人民，种粮食的没有饭吃，种棉织布的没有衣穿，烧砖盖房的没有屋子住。这种情况，在你们看来，是天经地义，不容怀疑的。但在我们劳动人民看来，就是不合理，就是要把它翻转过来。所以农民、工人都要起来造反，造一切剥削阶级的反。就拿我们妇女来说，在旧社会里，我们广大劳动妇女被政权、族权、神权、夫权这四条极大的绳索紧紧捆绑着，只有给剥削阶级当牛、当马、当玩物，根本没有做人的自由。我们劳动人民就是认为不合理，就是要砍断、挣脱这四大绳索，争取我们的自由和解放。
    可笑的资产阶级老爷们，老实告诉你们吧，过去自由是你们的，现在自由是我们的了。我们的自由是靠革命、靠造反得来的。无产阶级闹革命就是要造资产阶级的反，就是要剥夺一切剥削阶级的自由。事情就是这样，我们不剥夺你们这些牛鬼蛇神反革命的自由，你们就将加倍地剥夺我们的自由。我们不造你们这些剥削阶级的反，你们就要造我们无产阶级的反。
    事实证明，只有在毛泽东思想的红太阳的照耀下，彻底革命，彻底造反，劳动人民才有自由，劳动妇女才有自由。今天，我们妇女和所有劳动人民都彻底翻身，真正自由了。我们这些女飞行员，在旧社会都是出身贫苦，连活命的自由都没有的人，是共产党和毛主席把我们从苦海里搭救出来，领着我们闹革命，领着我们造剥削阶级的反，才得到了今天的自由。为了实现共同的革命目标，我们从五湖四海走到一起来了，共同的阶级命运使我们结成了碧空姐妹。毛泽东思想给我们插上了翅膀，指引着我们在祖国的蓝天上自由翱翔！我们看到祖国面貌日新月异，人换思想，山河变样。我们再不是整天围着锅台转，而是为了保卫祖国，为了世界革命而绕着地球转了！
    今天，我们有为人民服务、为革命奋斗的自由，有参与国家大事、发议论、写文章的自由，有学习与掌握毛泽东思想的自由，有拿起毛泽东思想这个锐利思想武器横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的自由。所有这一切自由，都是在毛泽东思想的指引下，造了你们剥削阶级的反，剥夺了你们反革命的自由才得到的。当然，你们绝不会甘心退出历史舞台，你们每时每刻都在想搞资本主义复辟，妄图恢复你们失去的自由天堂。你们不是连做梦都在叫嚷只准你们有放毒的自由，不准我们有反击的自由吗？如果你们篡党、篡军、篡政的阴谋一旦得逞，“黄袍加身”，坐了天下，那你们就会“自由”到杀我们的头，吸我们的血，把我们打入十八层地狱了。告诉你们，资产阶级老爷们，休要痴心妄想，这是永远办不到的。
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们更要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧跟定伟大的统帅毛主席，在革命的大风暴中，搏击长空，把一切剥削阶级的意识形态杀个片甲不留。一切剥削阶级听着：我们就是要造你们的反。只许无产阶级革命造反，不许剥削阶级乱说乱动。造反有理，这就是马克思主义的道理。这道理你们爱听也得听，不爱听也得听，这里绝没有你们的什么“自由”！
