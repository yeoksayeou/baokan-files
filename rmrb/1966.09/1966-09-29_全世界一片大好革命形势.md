With the 700 million people of our country brimming with revolutionary enthusiasm as we celebrate the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we are facing a great revolutionary situation both at home and abroad. Internationally, as the communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China points out: "The current struggle of Marxists-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world against imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism is in a great situation. We are now in a new era of world revolution. Various political forces are undergoing a great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization."

In the current great international situation, the Chinese people, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are the backbone of the world's revolutionary people. They are seen by the revolutionary people of the world as their strongest support and most reliable friends. New China has become the center that all revolutionary people look up to. Revolutionary people of various countries often say that the most precious assistance China has given them is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought is illuminating the world and lighting up the path to liberation for the peoples of various countries. Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly becoming the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for the revolutionary peoples of the world in their struggle against imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism. It greatly inspires the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

As Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly spreading and being grasped by revolutionary people, the revolutionary ranks of Marxism-Leninism in the world are continuously growing. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries, especially those in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are flourishing. In this vast region, the revolutionary peoples of more than 20 countries or regions have already or are currently taking up arms to engage in life-and-death armed struggles against American imperialism and its lackeys. A new revolutionary storm is rising across the world. Under the impact of the revolutionary torrent of the world's peoples, the entire old world, including the imperialist, reactionary, and modern revisionist cliques, is being beaten to pieces and disintegrating. Facing them is the setting sun and a dead end.

    全世界一片大好革命形势
    在我国七亿人民满怀革命豪情欢庆中华人民共和国成立十七周年的时候，我们在国内外都面临着一派大好的革命形势。在国际方面，正如中共八届十一中全会公报所指出的：“当前全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民反对帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义的斗争，形势是大好的。当前正处在世界革命的一个新时代。各种政治力量正在经历着一个大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面。”
    在当前大好的国际形势中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民是世界人民革命的中流砥柱，被世界革命人民视为他们最坚强的后盾和最可靠的朋友，新中国已经成为一切革命人民仰望的中心。世界各国革命人民经常说，中国给予他们的援助当中，最可贵的是向他们提供了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉正在照耀着全世界，照亮着各国人民的解放道路。毛泽东思想日益成为全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义的最强大、最锐利的思想武器，极大地鼓舞着全世界人民的革命斗争。
    随着毛泽东思想越来越广泛的传播和为革命人民所掌握，全世界马克思列宁主义的革命队伍正在不断壮大，各国人民的革命运动，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命运动，正在蓬勃发展。在这个广大地带，有二十多个国家或地区的革命人民，已经或者正在拿起武器，同美帝国主义及其走狗展开你死我活的武装斗争。一个新的革命风暴正在全世界兴起。在世界人民革命洪流的冲击下，包括帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义集团在内的整个旧世界，正在被打得落花流水、分崩离析，摆在它们面前的是日薄西山，死路一条。
