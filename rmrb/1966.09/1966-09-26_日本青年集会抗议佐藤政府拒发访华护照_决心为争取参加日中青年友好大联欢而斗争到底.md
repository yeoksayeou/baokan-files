Japanese youth from various parts of the country who have gathered in Tokyo to prepare for the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival held a meeting at the Cultural Hall of the Japan Socialist Party on the afternoon of September 24. They protested against the Sato government's refusal to issue visas for China, which obstructs Japan-China friendship and follows the U.S. in intensifying anti-China actions.

Socialist Party Diet member Oshiba Shigeo said at the meeting, "The Japanese government is obstructing your participation in the Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival. You must be determined to struggle to the end to win the right to visit China." A color documentary film titled "Unity is Strength," which records the successful first Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival, was shown at the meeting.

When the scene of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, meeting with Japanese youth appeared, the entire audience immediately erupted in cheers, and a long, thunderous applause broke out.

Before the meeting ended, all the representatives linked arms and sang the song "Tokyo-Beijing." Finally, the people raised their arms and shouted, "Struggle to the end to win the right to visit China!"

The struggle of Japanese youth to participate in the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival is spreading from Tokyo to other cities across Japan.

On September 24, more than 400 people participated in a protest meeting held by the Chiba Prefecture branches of the Japan Socialist Youth League, the All-Japan Farmers Union, the Socialist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan. They protested against the Sato government's brutal trampling of the rights of the Japanese people, violation of the constitution, and outrageous anti-China actions.

    决心为争取参加日中青年友好大联欢而斗争到底
    新华社二十五日讯　东京消息：从日本各地到达东京的准备去北京参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢的日本青年代表二百八十多人，二十四日下午在社会党本部文化会馆举行集会，抗议佐藤政府拒发访华护照破坏日中友好往来和追随美国加紧反华的罪行。
    社会党国会议员大柴滋夫在会上讲话说：“日本政府阻挠你们参加日中青年友好大联欢，必须下定决心，为坚决争取访华而斗争到底。”在集会上还放映了第一届中日青年友好大联欢胜利成功的彩色纪录片《团结就是力量》。
    当中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席接见日本青年的镜头出现的时候，顿时全场一片欢腾，响起了长时间的暴风雨般的掌声。
    在大会结束前，全体代表手挽着手，唱起《东京—北京》的歌曲，最后人们振臂高呼“为取得访华护照而斗争到底”。
    声援日本青年争取参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢的斗争，正从东京向日本全国其它城市扩展。
    日本社会主义青年同盟、全日本农民协会联合会、社会党和工会总评议会等的千叶县地方组织，二十四日举行了四百多人参加的抗议集会，反对佐藤政府残暴地践踏日本国民的权利，违反宪法和猖狂反华的行径。
