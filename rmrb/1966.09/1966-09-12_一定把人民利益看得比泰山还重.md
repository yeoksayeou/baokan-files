Always Put the People's Interests Above Everything Else

Soldier Liu Yuxi

I am an old soldier. After enlisting, I was transferred several times, always feeling it didn't suit my interests. It was only after repeatedly studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" that I solved this problem.

When I first enlisted, the organization assigned me to the artillery company. Initially, I thought it was great to be a glorious people's artilleryman. But soon, my enthusiasm waned, feeling that all I did was handle small cannons, which was boring. Later, the organization assigned me to be a driver. At first, I thought this suited my interests and I wanted to do a good job. But after two months, my thoughts changed again, feeling that dealing with mules and horses all day had no future. Just then, the organization reassigned me to the anti-aircraft machine gun platoon as a machine gunner. When I first arrived at the anti-aircraft machine gun platoon, I felt quite proud, thinking that anti-aircraft gunners were specially trained to deal with air pirates, which was interesting. But as time passed, I felt it wasn't very meaningful either.

What kind of work is the most interesting? Under the guidance of leaders and comrades, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the people's liberation, and it is thoroughly for the people's interests." He also said: "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai..." Reading these two passages, I thought carefully, I have been in the army for over three years, changed jobs several times, why am I still not doing well? Comparing with Comrade Zhang Side, I realized that Comrade Zhang Side regarded the people's interests as heavier than Mount Tai, and no matter what work, as long as it is for the people, he thought it was the most interesting. But I was not like this, I had not established the viewpoint of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and I still had selfish thoughts. Comparing with Comrade Zhang Side, I felt ashamed.

Through studying, my thoughts improved, and I made up my mind to change my thoughts, to thoroughly and bit by bit eliminate selfish thoughts, and to resolutely fight against the "I" character. In this way, I gradually achieved the goal of doing whatever the Party assigns me to do.

    一定把人民利益看得比泰山还重
    战士　刘玉琪
    我是个老战士，入伍后，调动过几次工作，总觉得不合我的心意，直到后来反复学习了《为人民服务》，才把这个问题解决了。
    刚入伍，组织上分配我到炮兵连。起初，我觉得能当个光荣的人民炮兵不错。可是过了不久，劲头就小了，觉得整天搞的是小炮筒，没意思。后来组织上让我去当驭手。开始，自己想这正合自己心意，要好好干一场。可是干了两个月，思想问题又来了，成天跟骡马打交道，这有啥出息？刚巧这时组织上又把我调到高射机枪排当机枪手。刚到高射机枪排，挺神气，觉得高射机枪兵是专门对付空中飞贼的，有意思。可是时间一久，就又感到没啥大意思。
    到底什么工作最有意思？在领导和同志们的帮助下，我带着这个问题学习了《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”还说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重……。”读了这两段话，我就仔细地想，我在部队三年多了，工作岗位也换了好几次，为什么还是干不好呢？和张思德同志一比较就清楚了，原来张思德同志把人民利益看得比泰山还重，无论什么工作，只要是为人民服务，他就觉得最有意思。而我却不是这样，自己还没有树立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的观点，还有私心杂念。跟张思德同志一比，自己感到很惭愧。
    通过学习，我思想有了提高，就下定决心改造思想，狠狠地、一点一滴地挖掉私心杂念，跟“我”字作坚决的斗争。这样，我就逐渐做到了党叫干啥就干啥。
