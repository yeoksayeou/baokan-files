Marching Forward in the Direction Guided by Mao Zedong Thought!

African and Asian Writers and Scientists from Various Countries Praise Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought After Visiting Yan'an

Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: Representatives from many countries and regions attending the Emergency Conference of Asian and African Writers in Beijing, as well as scientists from various countries participating in the 1966 Summer Physics Discussion held in Beijing, recently visited Yan'an, the cradle of the Chinese Revolution. They wrote inscriptions, poems, and shared their impressions with reporters, enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought is the Key to the Victory of the Chinese Revolution

Angolan poet Viriato da Cruz enthusiastically said, "In Yan'an, I clearly saw that Mao Zedong Thought is the key to the great Chinese revolution's victory. Yan'an is a shining example for revolutionary people to understand and change the world, and it is also a shining example of building a new life on the old and backward foundation."

Abdul Bakari Buwana from the Comoros Islands said, "The revolutionary university of Yan'an gave us precious knowledge and experience. The teacher of this university is Mao Zedong. We must further seriously study Mao Zedong's works and resolutely apply Mao Zedong Thought to our own country's practical struggles."

Antonio Cubillo from the Canary Islands also wrote an inscription praising Yan'an with great passion: "We thank the Chinese people for their revolutionary example and all the sacrifices they have made. All revolutionaries in the world will come to Yan'an, because the freedom of the world and the freedom of the proletarian masses of all countries were born in Yan'an."

Nancy Grant from Sierra Leone in West Africa wrote a poem titled "Song of Yan'an": "Yan'an, Yan'an, your hills are so yearned for! The cave dwellings—symbols of indomitable will, Heroic aspirations flourish, Dare to struggle, dare to win, freedom is your goal, Forward, forward, march towards victory!"

The Road of Yan'an is the Road for the People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America

Iranian representative Ramin wrote in his inscription, "The road of Yan'an is the road for the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Yan'an is a revolutionary university for all oppressed people in the world. Comrade Mao Zedong, with his unremitting efforts and wise leadership, led the great Chinese revolution to victory and developed Marxism-Leninism by establishing such an unprecedented base, pointing out the path of struggle for all revolutionaries in the world."

Indonesian writers, while visiting Chairman Mao's former residence in Yan'an, touched the desk, chair, or writing instruments used by Chairman Mao with deep emotions, carefully recording every word of the guide. An Indonesian female writer said passionately, "Now I have seen Yan'an with my own eyes! But Yan'an has long been in the hearts of the Indonesian people." She pointed out, "Based on the rich experience of the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao wrote many great works in Yan'an. These theories have become the guiding principles for the actions of the oppressed people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are engaged in armed struggles against imperialism, colonialism, and fascist dictatorship. Chairman Mao's works are an invincible spiritual force."

Indonesian representative Agam Wisbi emphasized in his inscription, "Yan'an will forever be in the hearts of the Indonesian people and all people around the world who are fighting for their country's liberation. Yan'an will forever strengthen the will of revolutionaries to oppose American imperialism and modern revisionism. Yan'an belongs not only to the Chinese people but also to the people of the world."

Chairman Mao Creatively Developed Marxism-Leninism

Vietnamese, Filipino, and Japanese writers, after visiting Yan'an, also wrote inscriptions praising the greatness of Yan'an, the holy land of the Chinese revolution. The Vietnamese writers' delegation representative Nguyen Truong Tho emphasized that Chairman Mao wrote many important works in Yan'an, "creatively applying and developing Marxism-Leninism." Filipino representative Amado Hernandez enthusiastically praised, "Yan'an is not only an impregnable fortress of freedom and liberation for the Chinese people, but today it is also a beacon for all oppressed people and revolutionaries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

A Japanese scientist, after visiting exhibits related to Chairman Mao leading the Chinese people in armed struggle at the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall, said, "The experience of the Chinese revolution has made people understand a truth: armed revolutionary people overthrow armed counter-revolutionaries, surround the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seize the entire political power. Chairman Mao's strategic thinking points out the direction of the revolution."

Many scientists enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's wise judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. A Latin American scientist said, "Chairman Mao's judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is the truth. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have shattered the myth that American imperialism is 'strong.' The Chinese people have become a shining example for the world's people in the anti-American revolutionary struggle." Chilean scientist Danilo Villarroel Silva enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's point about "all reactionaries being paper tigers" as "the most correct strategic and tactical thinking. If the people of the world follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, the world revolution will definitely make great strides forward." A Japanese scientist said, "With Mao Zedong Thought as a spiritual weapon, revolution can be made anywhere, and any reactionary can be overthrown."

The Anti-Japanese Military and Political University is the Most Revolutionary School

Foreign friends, while visiting the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University exhibition, enthusiastically praised: Thirty years ago, Chairman Mao established the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Yan'an, which is the most advanced, revolutionary, and progressive school in world history, and the most comprehensive and vivid example of implementing Chairman Mao's great educational thoughts. A scientist from Latin America, after visiting here, linked this to Chairman Mao's recent proposal that all sectors should establish revolutionary universities that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. He said deeply moved, "I think Chairman Mao's guiding principles are a great innovation and contribution to the world." He said, "Previously, I thought that scientists, researchers, professors, and university students, while working, engaging in scientific research, and studying, were wasting time. After visiting China, I realized that this method not only changes thinking but also promotes the development of science; it is not wasting time but gaining time."

Foreign friends, while visiting Chairman Mao's former residence and the Yan'an Revolutionary Memorial Hall, learned that Chairman Mao, under extremely difficult conditions, with a high degree of proletarian revolutionary fighting spirit, wrote a large number of revolutionary theoretical works, brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. This further aroused their love and respect for Chairman Mao. A Japanese scientist said, "The Yan'an cave dwellings are revolutionary cave dwellings, and the Yan'an cave dwellings have Mao Zedong Thought."

Mao Zedong Thought Belongs to the People of the World

Ecuadorian scientist Gustavo Arroyo Moncayo, after listening to the guide's introduction, said excitedly, "Like Mao Zedong, who devoted all his energy to the interests of ordinary workers and peasants, working selflessly, is rare in the world. Mao Zedong is the great leader of the masses." An Argentine scientist said, "Chairman Mao, for the cause of the people's revolution, lived a life of hardship and shared joys and sorrows with the people during the long revolutionary struggle, working hard and struggling, which is the most noble and precious quality of a great revolutionary leader." Chilean scientist Danilo Villarroel Silva said, "The path of combining intellectuals with the masses pointed out by Chairman Mao is the only correct path. To become a true revolutionary, one must, like Chairman Mao himself did and said, go to the masses to learn, work, and temper oneself, combine with the masses, never leave the masses, and always serve the masses." Guinean scientist Sedu said, "We should not only follow in the footsteps of Mao Zedong but also march forward in the direction guided by Mao Zedong Thought!"

A Latin American scientist said, "Mao Zedong Thought belongs to the Chinese people and also to the people of the world. Yan'an is the holy land of the world's revolutionary people. As long as there is Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary spirit of Yan'an will definitely remain unchanged, and the revolutionary spirit of Yan'an will definitely be carried forward."

    朝着毛泽东思想指引的方向前进！
    亚非作家和各国科学家访问延安后热情歌颂毛主席和毛泽东思想
    新华社六日讯　参加在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议的许多国家和地区的代表，以及参加北京科学讨论会一九六六年暑期物理讨论会的各国科学家们，不久以前，参观访问了中国革命摇篮——延安。他们纷纷题词、写诗、向记者发表观感，热情地歌颂伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东思想是中国革命胜利的钥匙
    安哥拉诗人维里亚托·达克鲁斯热情洋溢地说：“在延安，我清楚地看到毛泽东思想是中国伟大革命胜利的钥匙。延安是使革命人民认识世界和改造世界的光辉榜样，也是胜利地在旧的和落后的基础上建立新生活的光辉榜样。”
    来自科摩罗群岛的代表阿布杜·巴卡里·布瓦纳说：“延安这所革命大学给了我们宝贵的知识和经验。这个大学的老师就是毛泽东。我们要进一步认真学习毛泽东著作，并决心把毛泽东思想应用到自己国家的实际斗争中去。”
    加那利群岛的代表安东尼奥·库比洛也满怀激情地题词颂扬延安：“我们感谢中国人民的革命榜样，感谢他们所作出的一切牺牲。全世界的革命者都将到延安来，因为世界的自由和各国无产阶级群众的自由是在延安诞生。”
    来自西非的塞拉勒窝内的代表南西·格兰特夫人写了一首颂诗：《延安之歌》。诗中写道：
      “延安呵，延安，你的山岗令人多么向往！
    窑洞——坚韧意志的象征，
    英雄奇志大发扬，
    敢于斗争，敢于胜利，自由是你的目标，
    前进，前进，走向胜利的前方！”
    延安的道路是亚非拉人民的道路
    伊朗代表拉明在题词中说：“延安的道路是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的道路。延安是全世界被压迫人民的一所革命大学校。毛泽东同志不仅以他不懈的努力和英明的领导把中国人民的伟大革命推向了胜利，而且以建立这样史无前例的根据地发展了马克思列宁主义，向全世界一切革命者指明了战斗的道路。”
    印度尼西亚的作家们在参观毛主席在延安的旧居时，大家怀着特别深厚的感情抚摸毛主席当年办公的书桌、坐过的椅子或用过的笔墨文具，仔细记录了讲解员的每一句话。一位印度尼西亚女作家满怀激情地说：“现在我亲眼看到了延安！但是延安早已活在我们印度尼西亚人民心中。”她指出：“毛主席根据中国革命的丰富经验，在延安写下了许多伟大的著作。这些理论已成为世界被压迫人民、特别是正在进行反对帝国主义、殖民主义和法西斯专政的武装斗争的亚非拉人民的行动指南。毛主席的这些著作是不可战胜的精神力量。”
    印度尼西亚代表阿甘姆·维斯比在题词中强调指出，“延安将永远活在印度尼西亚人民及世界上一切为了本国解放而斗争的人民的心中。延安将永远坚定革命者反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的意志。延安不仅属于中国人民，也属于世界人民。”
    毛主席创造性地发展了马列主义
    越南、菲律宾和日本的作家们在参观访问延安后，也纷纷题词颂扬中国革命圣地延安的伟大。越南作家代表团代表黄忠通等强调指出，毛主席在延安写下了许多重要著作，“创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义。”菲律宾代表阿马多·埃尔南德斯热烈赞扬说：“延安不仅是中国人民的自由和解放的坚不可摧的堡垒，今天它也是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲一切被压迫人民、一切革命者的灯塔。”
    一位日本科学家参观了延安革命纪念馆里毛主席领导中国人民进行武装斗争的一些展品后说：“中国革命的经验，使人们懂得了一个真理，就是用武装的革命人民打倒武装的反革命，以农村包围城市，最后夺取整个政权。毛主席的这个战略思想，指明了革命的方向。”
    不少科学家热烈称颂毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。一位拉丁美洲科学家说：“毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断是真理。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，打破了人们认为美帝国主义‘强大’的迷信。中国人民成为世界人民反美革命斗争的光辉榜样。”智利科学家达尼洛·比利亚罗埃尔·席尔瓦热情赞扬毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论点是“最正确的战略和策略思想，世界人民都照毛主席指引的方向走，世界革命定将会大步前进。”一位日本科学家说：“有了毛泽东思想这个精神武器，任何地方都可以闹革命，任何反动派都可以打倒。”
    抗日军政大学是最革命的学校
    外国朋友们在参观抗大展览的时候，热情地赞扬：三十年前，毛主席在延安创建的抗日军政大学，是世界历史上最新型、最革命、最进步的学校，是最全面、最生动地贯彻毛泽东伟大教育思想的典范。一位来自拉丁美洲的科学家通过这里的参观，联系到毛主席最近提出的各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的思想，深有所感地说：“我认为毛主席提出的这一纲领性的指示，在世界上是一个伟大的创举和贡献。”他说：“过去我认为科学家、研究人员、教授和大学生，一面劳动，一面从事科研工作和学习是浪费时间。来中国参观以后，认识到这种方法不仅可以改造思想，而且促进了科学事业的发展；不是浪费时间，而是赢得了时间。”
    外国朋友在参观毛主席旧居和延安革命纪念馆的过程中，了解到毛主席在极其艰苦的条件下，以高度的无产阶级革命战斗精神，写出大量的革命理论著作，天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，更加激起了他们对毛主席的爱戴和崇敬的感情。日本科学家说：“延安窑洞是革命的窑洞，延安的窑洞里有毛泽东思想。”
    毛泽东思想属于全世界人民
    厄瓜多尔科学家古斯塔沃·阿罗约·蒙卡约听了解说员的介绍后激动地说：“像毛泽东这样为了普通工人农民的利益，集中全部精力，忘我地工作，在世界上是罕见的。毛泽东是人民群众的伟大领袖。”一位阿根廷科学家说：“毛主席为了人民革命的事业，在艰苦的年代，在深山里，在长期的革命斗争中，过着和人民同甘共苦的生活，艰苦奋斗，这正是一个伟大革命领袖最高尚最宝贵的品质。”智利科学家达尼洛·比利亚罗埃尔·席尔瓦说：“毛主席指出的知识分子和人民群众相结合的道路，是唯一正确的道路。要成为一个真正的革命者，就必须像毛主席自己做的和说的那样，到人民群众中去学习、劳动和锻炼，和人民群众相结合，永远不脱离人民群众，永远为人民群众服务。”几内亚科学家赛杜说：“我们不仅应该跟着毛泽东走过的脚印去走，还要朝着毛泽东思想指引的方向前进！”
    一位拉丁美洲科学家说：“毛泽东思想是属于中国人民的，也是属于全世界人民的。延安是世界革命人民的圣地，只要有了毛泽东思想，就一定能够保持延安革命精神永不变色，就一定能够使延安革命精神发扬光大。”
