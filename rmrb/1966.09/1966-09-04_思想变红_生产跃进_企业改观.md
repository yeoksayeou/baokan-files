The thirty-plus coal varieties in Fushun Coal Mine have all exceeded their production targets. Labor efficiency has increased, unit costs have decreased, technological innovations have multiplied, management personnel have been streamlined, and the cumbersome management practices have been significantly reduced.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang, Fushun Coal Mine has seen a comprehensive leap in coal production this year. All work has been done more, faster, better, and more economically. This is the result of the entire mine's workforce holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing revolution to promote production.

In the first seven months of this year, Fushun Coal Mine's coal production has significantly increased. Production preparation work has been steadily carried out, and all economic and technical indicators have been well completed. Many have jumped from the middle and lower ranks to become nationally advanced. The production targets for over thirty coal varieties have all been exceeded. Under the condition of reducing personnel without increasing equipment, labor efficiency has increased by 37% compared to last year, unit costs have decreased by a quarter, and the annual profit target has been exceeded by half a year. At the same time, ten mechanized, semi-mechanized, and automated production lines have emerged, achieving nearly 800 technological innovations. New technologies, new processes, and new materials used in production have increased significantly, markedly improving comprehensive production capacity. Due to extensive reforms in organizational structure, business operations, and regulations, management personnel have been reduced by one-third, and the metaphysical and cumbersome philosophies in management work have been greatly reduced, strengthening the service-oriented perspective for production. All of this is rapidly changing the face of this old mining area.

The achievements of Fushun Coal Mine powerfully demonstrate that emphasizing revolution, socialist education, the Cultural Revolution, and the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works to promote the ideological transformation of the workforce are powerful driving forces for production development. Since this year, the broad masses of workers in Fushun Coal Mine have used all available time to read Chairman Mao's works, gaining nutrition, strength, sunlight, reflection, and cleansing every day. Addressing the issue of miners living scattered, far from home, and having limited time for study and discussion, the mine leadership promoted the method of the Communist Youth League's open-air school, implementing a system where workers take turns living and studying. Each person studies for one month per quarter, spending three to four hours after work each day, with two-thirds of the time dedicated to studying Chairman Mao's works and criticizing the bourgeoisie, and one-third to studying military, cultural, and technical subjects. Now, over ten thousand workers have been trained through this new type of school. They say: After reading Chairman Mao's works, our minds are clear, our bones are strong, our courage is bolstered, and we are full of strength.

Laohutai Coal Mine is a microcosm of the changes in the entire Fushun Coal Mine. This mine has long used an outdated mining method, with low efficiency, excessive equipment, and high material consumption. Over the years, although new mining methods have been continuously researched and tested, they have not been successful because the focus was solely on technology without emphasizing politics. This year, under the drive of socialist education and the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using the "Three Articles," "On Contradiction," and "On Practice" as weapons to fight against bourgeois technical "authorities." Through practice, revolution, and repeated experiments, they have overcome more than ten difficulties and successfully implemented the advanced long-wall mining method in just six months, pioneering a new path for mechanized mining in thick coal seams with water and sand filling. Using this advanced method, the coal production per unit area has increased by 95%, and personnel, equipment, and materials have been significantly reduced.

Currently, the workers of all factories and mines under Fushun Coal Mine are relying on Mao Zedong Thought, the most powerful weapon, to deeply carry out the socialist education movement and the Cultural Revolution. They are exposing and criticizing all those in power who are taking the capitalist road and criticizing Sun Yefang's entire set of reactionary fallacies of profit and currency supremacy. The broad masses of workers are greatly advocating the spirit of wholeheartedly and entirely for the revolution. The workers have expressed that they will definitely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to achieve double victories in revolution and production, and strive to complete all tasks for the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

    思想变红　生产跃进　企业改观
    抚顺煤矿三十多个煤种产量计划全部超额完成，劳动效率提高，单位成本下降，技术革新项目增多，管理人员精简，经营管理工作中的烦琐哲学大大减少
    据新华社沈阳电　抚顺煤矿今年的煤炭生产出现全面跃进的大好局面，各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省，这是全矿职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出地抓革命促生产的结果。
    今年前七个多月，抚顺煤矿的煤炭产量大幅度提高，生产准备工作也稳妥地进行，全部经济技术指标完成得很好，其中不少由中下游一跃为全国先进水平。三十多个煤种的产量计划也全部超额完成。在减人不增设备的条件下，劳动效率比去年提高百分之三十七，单位成本下降四分之一，已经提前半年超额完成全年上缴利润计划。同时，接连出现十条机械化、联动化和自动化作业线，实现近八百项技术革新，用于生产的新技术、新工艺和新材料更多了，显著地提高了综合生产能力。由于大刀阔斧地改革机构，改革业务，改革规章制度，管理人员精简了三分之一，经营管理工作中的形而上学和烦琐哲学大大减少了，为生产服务的观点加强了。这一切迅猛地改变着这个老矿区的面貌。
    抚顺煤矿取得的成就有力地表明：突出地抓革命，抓社会主义教育，抓无产阶级文化大革命，抓活学活用毛主席著作，促进职工队伍的思想革命化，是发展生产的巨大推动力。今年以来，抚顺煤矿广大职工把一切可以利用的时间，用来读毛主席的书，天天增营养，天天加力量，天天晒太阳，天天照镜子，天天洗脸。针对矿工居住分散、家远、学习和讨论时间少的问题，煤矿领导推广了西露天矿创造的共产主义业余大学校的办法，实行职工轮流住宿学习制度。每人每季入学一个月，每天下班后学习三到四小时，其中三分之二时间学毛主席著作，批判资产阶级，三分之一时间学军事、文化、技术。现在经过这所新型大学校轮训的职工已达万名以上。他们说：读了毛主席的书，心明眼亮，骨头硬，胆子壮，浑身都是力量。
    老虎台煤矿是整个抚顺煤矿变化的缩影。这个矿过去一直采用一种落后采煤法，效率低，设备多，材料消耗大。多年来，虽然不断研究试验新的采煤法，但是因为只是就技术抓技术，不突出政治，一直未获成功。今年，在社会主义教育和文化大革命推动下，广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，运用“老三篇”、《矛盾论》、《实践论》为武器，同资产阶级技术“权威”展开斗争，通过实践，大闹革命，反复试验，终于闯过十几道难关，仅仅用六个月时间就成功地实现了倾斜长壁先进采煤法，为特厚煤层水砂充填机械化采煤开创出一条新道路。采用这种先进方法，采煤单位面积产量提高了百分之九十五，人员、设备、材料大大减少。
    目前，抚顺煤矿所属各厂矿职工依靠毛泽东思想这个最强大武器，正在社会主义教育运动中，深入开展无产阶级文化大革命，揭露和批判一切走资本主义道路的当权派，批判孙冶方一整套利润挂帅、钞票挂帅的修正主义反动谬论。广大职工一心为革命、一切为革命的精神大大发扬。职工们表示，一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做到革命和生产双胜利，为完成第三个五年计划第一年的各项任务而奋斗。
