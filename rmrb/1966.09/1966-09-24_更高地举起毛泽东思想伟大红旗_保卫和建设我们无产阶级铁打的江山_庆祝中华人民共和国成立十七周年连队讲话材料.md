The glorious national day of our 700 million people – the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China – is approaching.

This year, we are celebrating this great festival with revolutionary fervor in the midst of the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

The entire country is ablaze with revolutionary fervor. Industry and agriculture are flourishing, and new leaps forward are emerging on all fronts.

The struggle of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries is also in a very good situation.

All the achievements of our people's revolutionary cause are victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and they are the results of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

I. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a great innovation in the communist movement and a great innovation in the socialist revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao is a deeper and broader new stage in the development of our socialist revolution, a great innovation in the communist movement, and a great innovation in the socialist revolution.

This cultural revolution is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between the bourgeoisie's conspiracy to restore power and the proletariat's counter-restoration. It is an extremely fierce, extremely sharp, and extremely profound class struggle. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship in our country, the bourgeoisie, if they want to usurp power, will always do so through the small number of power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road, that is, the counter-revolutionary revisionists. The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated the Party are the most dangerous and most important enemy. If we do not overthrow them, once they find an opportunity, they will, like Khrushchev, rise up to usurp the leadership of our Party and state, changing the color of our entire country. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to expose all the power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road, to dig out all the time bombs buried within the Party, to prevent counter-revolutionary subversion, and to consolidate our ironclad proletarian state.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the soul. Chairman Mao said: "The proletariat wants to change the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to change the world according to its worldview." In our country, although the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, they still exist, and their hearts do not die. They always try to use the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes to corrupt the masses and conquer people's hearts, in an attempt to achieve their counter-revolutionary restoration. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must thoroughly criticize all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes, and establish new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat. In a word, we must establish Mao Zedong Thought. We must let hundreds of millions of people master Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, and use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the entire society, fundamentally uproot the roots of revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also the best and greatest preparation for repelling and crushing a possible sudden attack by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices.

Chairman Mao pointed out that the fundamental contradiction that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution wants to solve is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. The focus of the movement is to struggle against the power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road.

In 1962, Chairman Mao, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, put forward the great call to never forget class struggle, pointing out the most steadfast direction for the entire Party and the people of the country. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the socialist education movement in cities and rural areas was carried out, becoming the driving force for the socialist construction of our country. In 1964, there was a "left" in form but right in essence error within the Party. Chairman Mao personally led the formulation of the "Twenty-three Articles," ensuring that the socialist education movement proceeded on the correct track.

In the latter half of 1965, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pushing our socialist revolution to a new stage. However, those power-holders who take the capitalist road, those reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, stubbornly resisted from their reactionary positions, fiercely suppressing the revolutionary mass movement, attempting to smash down this magnificent revolution. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao, in August 1966, personally presided over the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and personally presided over the formulation of the "Decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," that is, the "Sixteen Articles." The "Sixteen Articles" summarized the new experience of the mass revolutionary movement, corrected the erroneous line, reversed the erroneous direction, and pointed out the road to continued victory. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered a new high tide.

On August 18th, 31st, and September 15th, our great leader Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniform, together with his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao and other central leaders, received the Red Guards and revolutionary students from the capital and from all over the country at Tiananmen Square three times, giving great encouragement to the broad revolutionary masses. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out more vigorously throughout the country. The situation is getting better and better.

Chairman Mao has given a high evaluation of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao said: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological revolution of the people of the entire country."

In this great mass movement of the cultural revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force. The Red Guards composed of revolutionary students from primary and secondary schools and other revolutionary youth organizations have become the vanguard of the cultural revolution. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres inspire, learn from, support, and rely on each other, and launch a fierce attack on the power-holders who take the capitalist road, on all the strongholds of the bourgeoisie, and on all the monsters and demons. In just a few months, they have achieved brilliant results.

We have exposed one after another of the power-holders within the Party who take the capitalist road, smashed large and small "Three-Family Villages" and "Four-Family Shops," exposed all kinds of monsters and demons, and fought them down, fought them over, and fought them to ruin.

We have criticized the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie in the academic, educational, news, literary, and publishing circles, as well as other cultural circles, and criticized many bad plays, bad films, and bad works. We have fought the reactionary "experts," "scholars," and "ancestors" of the bourgeoisie to the ground, sweeping away their prestige.

We are currently reforming education, literature and art, and all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base.

The daring, bold, and revolutionary Red Guards have left the schools and gone to the streets, thoroughly criticizing the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News." They have made the power-holders who take the capitalist road and the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie look miserable. Those old parasites, vampires, and enemies of the people hiding in dark corners have been exposed one by one. Their hidden gold and silver treasures, hidden various "change-of-heaven" accounts, and weapons for killing people have been taken out for public display. The Red Guards have done a lot of good deeds, put forward a lot of good initiatives, and established great merits. The broad masses of Red Guards have learned revolution from revolution and grown through struggle.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already touched politics and economics. It is powerfully promoting the ideological revolution of people, further liberating the productive forces of society, and becoming a powerful driving force for the development of the productive forces of our country.

Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shaken the entire world, making imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries tremble with fear, and greatly encouraging the revolutionary people of the world.

Our People's Liberation Army, with a high sense of political responsibility and great revolutionary enthusiasm, actively participates in the cultural revolution. The broad cadres and soldiers, in the struggle, study Chairman Mao's works actively and practically, firmly implement the "Sixteen Articles," stand firmly, hold the banner high, enthusiastically support the leftists, and severely strike down the rightists and all monsters and demons. They criticize the reactionary ideology of the bourgeoisie with their mouths and pens, and in the struggle against the enemies who do not carry guns, they closely watch the enemies who carry guns, strictly guard their battle positions, strengthen organizational discipline, maintain high concentration and unity, heighten revolutionary vigilance, and are ready at any time to crush any sudden attack by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, defending our ironclad proletarian state. We are determined to respond to Chairman Mao's great call and, together with the people of the entire country, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

II. The great mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically has opened a new era for the laboring people to directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism.

The great mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically is surging forward throughout the country. This great mass movement has opened a new era for the laboring people to directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism.

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the entire Party and the entire country.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres have limitless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and limitless loyalty to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They regard Chairman Mao's books as the guide for all their actions. They say, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. 'A thousand things, ten thousand things, the most important thing is to read Chairman Mao's books.' 'To devote one's life to revolution, one must study Chairman Mao's works for life.' From cities to rural areas, from the coastal defenses to the borders, people of all ethnic groups and revolutionaries in all industries are studying Chairman Mao's works. Those with high cultural levels are studying, those with low cultural levels, and even those who are illiterate are also studying. Throughout the country, tens of thousands of advanced individuals and units who study Chairman Mao's works actively and practically have emerged.

In recent years, all the cadres and soldiers of our People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to "hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and truly master Mao Zedong Thought," launching a large-scale and persistent mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically throughout the army, promoting our army to advance rapidly on the road of being extremely proletarian and extremely militant. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, our army is full of good people and good deeds, and heroes and models keep emerging. Lei Feng, Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, etc., are outstanding representatives. In these heroic figures, the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought is vividly reflected.

The broad masses of workers, after studying Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, further raising their proletarian consciousness. They display the fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to think and dare to do, breaking through "difficulties" and attacking "fortresses." The 1202 and 1205 drilling teams of the Daqing Oilfield, studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically, broke through the 60,000-meter drilling mark in just over seven months, far exceeding the highest annual drilling record of 40,816 meters set by a Soviet drilling team. Shanghai worker-turned expert in electric light sources Cai Zuquan and his comrades, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, broke through the blockade of imperialism and modern revisionism, successfully developing more than a dozen new types of electric light sources, including the "Little Sun," making outstanding contributions to the development of new lighting technology in our country. Countless vivid examples prove that the working class of our country, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is the bravest and most intelligent, able to scale the peak of scientific and technological development.

The broad masses of peasants, studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds, undergoing a profound change in their spiritual outlook. The people of Dazhai, through studying Chairman Mao's works, established the idea of farming for revolution, turning the poor and barren old Dazhai into a prosperous socialist new Dazhai with a thriving collective economy. The Huangshandong Brigade of Boluo County, Guangdong Province, studied Chairman Mao's works, broke private interests and established public interests, with everyone striving to be a "living Yu Gong" who changes the sky and earth, and everyone striving to be a "good comrade" who is not afraid of difficulties. With a spirit of striving for progress and overcoming difficulties, they are working hard to change the poor and backward face of Huangshandong, vigorously carrying out agricultural water conservancy construction, transforming low-yield fields into high-yield fields, doubling the total output of rice. A large number of examples from various places prove that once peasants are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can break free from the shackles of private ownership and become revolutionary new-type peasants who stand out for the public and love the collective.

The Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee emphasized: "The entire Party and the entire country studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong is a major event of historical significance."

The plenary session pointed out: "Comrade Lin Biao called on the People's Liberation Army to launch a mass movement of studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong throughout the army, setting a brilliant example for the entire Party and the entire country. The method of studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong with problems, studying and applying them actively and practically, learning and applying them together, learning urgently what is needed urgently, seeing results immediately, and focusing on application, is effective, universally applicable, and should be further promoted throughout the Party and the country."

The people of the entire country have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee, and the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically has presented a new situation. Hundreds of millions of people, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, have become more conscious of studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically according to the principles and methods proposed by Comrade Lin Biao. In the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary little generals of the Red Guards, revolutionary students, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers together study Chairman Mao's works extensively, establish Mao Zedong Thought. On streets, squares, shops, factories, schools, and buses and trams, they read, write, and paste Chairman Mao's quotations extensively, creating a vast red sea of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" everywhere, and the resounding voice of reading Chairman Mao's quotations and the loud singing praising the great leader Chairman Mao everywhere. They regard this cultural revolution to criticize the bourgeoisie as the best classroom to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively and practically.

The Party Central Committee, to meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of the people to study Chairman Mao's works, decided to print and distribute a large number of Chairman Mao's works, including "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a large number of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great joy for the people of the entire country. Recently, various places throughout the country have begun to supply a large number of Chairman Mao's works, and the broad masses of the people are excited and spreading the news. They say: "Waiting for the stars, waiting for the moon, Chairman Mao's books have finally arrived," "Revolutionary helmsman Mao Chairman, the four-volume red book is the truth, every word and sentence talks about revolution, generation after generation cannot be separated from it."

Comrade Lin Biao proposed that the entire Party, the entire country, and the entire army should study and establish Mao Zedong Thought extensively. He said: "Our country is a great proletarian dictatorship socialist country with 700 million people, needing a unified ideology, revolutionary ideology, correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought. With this ideology, we can maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm and have a firm and correct political direction." We must respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works more tightly, study it better, apply it better, and achieve greater results.

III. With Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, grasp the revolution and promote production, and a new situation of all-round leaps forward is emerging on all fronts throughout the country.

We are building socialism on two fronts. One is the ideological front, which is to transform thoughts and raise proletarian revolutionary consciousness; the other is the material front, which is to transform nature and develop the socialist national economy. Advanced ideology leads the way. Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive guiding us to victory on these two fronts.

The mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically throughout the country and the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have greatly accelerated the ideological revolution of people. The great spiritual force of Mao Zedong Thought has become a great material force.

This year is the first year of our country's third five-year plan for developing the national economy. The people of the entire country, with Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, grasp the revolution and promote production, using the sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm aroused in the cultural revolution in the struggle of industrial and agricultural production and scientific experiments, thus making all work better, faster, more, and more economical. New situations of all-round leaps forward are emerging on all fronts throughout the country.

On the agricultural front, with the deepening of the socialist education movement, rural people's communes have been further consolidated and developed. Broad masses of rural cadres and commune members, emphasizing politics, studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically, learning from Dazhai, catching up with Dazhai, with a fearless spirit, are engaged in a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters, achieving good harvests for four consecutive years. This year, summer crops such as wheat and early rice have achieved large-area, large-scale increases in many places. Southern late rice and miscellaneous grains are all growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. The broad masses of commune members in the north are beginning to harvest corn, sorghum, and highland barley and other autumn crops with joyful hearts. The cotton fields in the north and south are laden with bolls, growing vigorously. This autumn's bumper harvest is guaranteed. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fisheries, and water conservancy, mechanization, electrification, and other industries in rural areas have also developed greatly. Self-reliance, hard work, fighting against nature, and changing the backward face of Dazhai-style advanced units are emerging everywhere.

On the industrial front, the broad masses of workers, taking Daqing as an example, run socialist enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought. They use politics to lead production, emphasizing the ideological revolution of people, promoting the leap forward in production, and the quantity, variety, and quality of products have all developed and improved greatly. For example, the steel industry has seen a significant increase in the production of steel, steel products, and pig iron in the first five months of this year compared to the same period last year. The number of new varieties of steel products successfully tested has reached more than 250. The production of ordinary low-alloy steel in the first five months of this year is equivalent to seven times the annual production of last year. The petroleum industry has seen a significant increase in the production of crude oil and major petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year, all exceeding the state plan. The textile industry has seen a significant increase in the production of major products such as cotton, wool, silk, hemp, chemical fibers, and textile machinery in the first eight months of this year, all exceeding the state plan, with a significant increase in production and stable improvement in quality. The production of cotton yarn has increased by 18%, higher than any year since the founding of New China.

On the basis of the great development of industrial and agricultural production, the national market is prosperous, prices are stable, and everywhere is a scene of prosperity.

In basic construction, transportation, education, health, scientific research, and other aspects, great achievements have also been made.

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, our people adhere to the principle of self-reliance, daring to tread paths that others have not trodden, and daring to scale peaks that others have not scaled. Many things that we did not have before now exist; many things that we could not make before now can be made. The success of the three nuclear explosions has concentratedly demonstrated the new level of scientific and technological development in our country, powerfully refuting the blockade and sabotage of imperialism and modern revisionism.

Chairman Mao said, the correct ideology of the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become the material force to transform society and the world. The brilliant achievements of our socialist revolution and socialist construction once again prove that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, once grasped by 700 million people, can create all miracles on earth.

IV. Turn our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and turn the entire country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our greatest leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: The People's Liberation Army should be a great school, and all industries throughout the country should be turned into revolutionary great schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. Chairman Mao's extremely important instruction has great historical significance and strategic significance, and it is our action guideline.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction, we can greatly raise proletarian revolutionary consciousness, promote the ideological revolution of the people throughout the country, and further build socialism quickly, well, and economically, eliminating the social and ideological foundations of capitalism and revisionism.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction, we can gradually narrow the gap between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between manual and mental labor, preparing the conditions for gradually transitioning to communism.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction, we can achieve universal military service, greatly strengthening our war preparedness.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction, our 700 million people can wield hammers to work, wield hoes to farm, wield guns to fight the enemy, and wield pens to write articles criticizing the bourgeoisie. We can cultivate and temper into new-type communists who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have high political consciousness, and are all-around developed.

Chairman Mao's great instruction is the latest summary of our army's several decades of military experience and the development of Chairman Mao's consistent military thought under new historical conditions. After Chairman Mao's great instruction was issued, our army responded enthusiastically, studying and understanding it seriously. Various units, according to their specific situations, formulated measures. The entire army, according to Comrade Lin Biao's instruction on emphasizing politics, increased political education time, using Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, studying politics, military affairs, and culture. Many units have carried forward the glorious tradition of being both a combat team, a work team, and a production team, actively carrying out mass work. In field training and assisting the masses in labor, they propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses, assist local groups in setting up night schools to study Chairman Mao's works, and hold lectures on the practical application of Chairman Mao's works together with the masses. They do well in agricultural and sideline production, set up small and medium-sized factories, actively participate in the socialist education movement in rural areas and factories, and participate in the cultural revolution to criticize the bourgeoisie. The broad cadres and soldiers are determined to turn our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, making our army advance to a higher stage on the road of being extremely proletarian and extremely militant.

Chairman Mao's great call has quickly spread throughout the country. The broad masses of the people are excited and praise Chairman Mao's instruction as the "golden bridge to communism" and the "blueprint for building communism." The workers and their families of the Daqing Oilfield, after seeing Chairman Mao's instruction, were greatly inspired. The drilling sites and oil wells are all joyful. In the past six years, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's thought, the workers and their families of Daqing have studied Chairman Mao's works extensively, engaged in industry, engaged in agriculture, combined industry and agriculture, and combined urban and rural areas. They have set up one industrial and agricultural village after another, which are called urban-type villages and village-type cities by everyone. They have set up militias extensively, studied culture, and practiced martial arts. In the cultural revolution, they have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize the bourgeoisie, sweeping away all monsters and demons. The broad masses of workers say: Chairman Mao mentioned Daqing in the instruction, setting higher requirements for us. With Chairman Mao's wise leadership, we were able to seize the world-class great oilfield in the past, building a new-type mining area that combines industry and agriculture and urban and rural areas. In the future, we will definitely be able to turn the oilfield into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

All industries and fronts throughout the country are taking concrete measures to implement Chairman Mao's instruction, more diligently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically. Many factories and mines, with industry as the main focus, also engage in agricultural and sideline production. People's communes, with agriculture as the main focus, set up small factories. Revolutionary teachers and students in various places are determined to learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, making education serve proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. All industries are setting up militias extensively, actively participating in the cultural revolution, and criticizing the bourgeoisie. The broad masses of workers and peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are determined to turn all industries into revolutionary great schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, struggling to accomplish the great historical tasks proposed by Chairman Mao.

V. The brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought shines all over the world, and the revolutionary situation throughout the world is excellent.

At present, we are in a new era of world revolution. The struggle of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries is presenting a very good situation.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is inspiring the revolutionary struggles of people all over the world, becoming the most precious common wealth and the most powerful source of strength for the revolutionary people of the world, becoming the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries.

People all over the world have limitless love for Chairman Mao and limitless love for Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao as the "greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time," the "great leader and teacher of the people of all countries," the "great helmsman of the world revolutionary ship," and the "red sun that never sets in the hearts of the people of the world." Mao Zedong Thought is the "universal truth guiding world revolution," and "only by following the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought can the people of the world achieve thorough liberation."

Many Marxist-Leninist brother parties are actively calling on the entire party to study Chairman Mao's works. The revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works, regarding them as the must-read textbooks for their revolutionary struggle for liberation. Many revolutionary fighters carry Chairman Mao's military works with them on the battlefield, fighting and studying at the same time. Many revolutionaries carry Chairman Mao's works deep into the mountains, mobilizing the peasants to struggle. In the prisons of the enemy and under the cruel white terror, many revolutionaries risk their lives to secretly circulate Chairman Mao's works.

According to incomplete statistics, at present, more than 60 countries and regions around the world have published and distributed more than 600 kinds of Chairman Mao's works in more than 60 languages. Chairman Mao's books have become the most beloved revolutionary books of the revolutionary people of the world.

Chairman Mao said: "Now is the historical era when world capitalism and imperialism are heading towards collapse, and world socialism and people's democracy are heading towards victory. The enemy is rotting away day by day, and we are getting better day by day." The development of the international situation completely confirms Chairman Mao's great scientific prediction.

Now, the revolutionary movements of the people of various countries in the world, especially the revolutionary movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are flourishing. The struggle of the revolutionary people of the world against U.S.-led imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries has achieved great victories. A new and greater anti-U.S. revolutionary storm is rising throughout the world.

The Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national liberation is the focal point of the current world anti-U.S. struggle. There, the strategy of people's war is defeating the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary global strategy. The heroic Vietnamese people neither yield to the military pressure of U.S. imperialism nor are deceived by the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks," fighting the so-called number one capitalist power of the present world to the point of internal and external difficulties, at a loss. The Johnson administration's increase of troops by 100,000 is ineffective, 200,000 is ineffective, and now increasing to more than 300,000 is still ineffective. The combat effectiveness of the U.S. invading army has been greatly destroyed, with more than 70,000 casualties. The great victory of the Vietnamese people has powerfully struck, tied up, and weakened the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism, disrupted the U.S. global aggression plan and war deployment, and greatly encouraged and supported the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries.

Chairman Mao said: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable, without which the leap in social development cannot be completed, and the reactionary ruling class cannot be overthrown, and the people cannot gain power."

Now, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, armed struggles are burning everywhere. In more than 20 countries and regions such as Laos, Thailand, North Kalimantan, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Yemen, Oman, Congo (Leopoldville), Angola, Portuguese Guinea, Mozambique, Cabo Verde, Zimbabwe, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, and Paraguay, the revolutionary people have already taken up arms and fiercely struck at imperialism and its running dogs.

The workers and laboring people of capitalist countries in Western Europe, North America, and Oceania are widely carrying out struggles against U.S. imperialism and the monopolies of their own countries. The struggles of the American people against the Johnson administration's aggression in Vietnam and the struggles of American blacks against racial discrimination are rising and falling. The contradictions between imperialist countries, especially between the U.S. and France, have reached an unprecedentedly fierce level since the end of World War II. U.S. imperialism is more isolated than ever, and its days are getting worse and worse.

The struggle of Marxist-Leninists around the world against modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU is developing in victory. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism are continuously expanding, and the modern revisionist group is continuously weakening. The new leadership of the CPSU insists on implementing Khrushchevism without Khrushchev. Their line is to maintain the rule of imperialism and colonialism in the capitalist world and carry out the restoration of capitalism in the socialist world. They are worse than Khrushchev, their position is weaker, and their situation is more difficult. They are pushing forward the revisionist policy of restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, making the Soviet Union go further and further down the road of capitalist restoration. They collude with U.S. imperialism, ally with Japanese militarism in the east, ally with West German militarism in the west, and ally with the reactionary forces of India in the south, forming a reactionary alliance against communism, against the people, against revolution, and against China. They have betrayed the revolutionary interests of the people of the Dominican Republic, Congo (Leopoldville), and Southern Rhodesia. On the issue of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression, the new leadership of the CPSU plays the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick of false support and true betrayal, serving the "peace talks" fraud of U.S. imperialism, and doing everything possible to help U.S. imperialism, attempting to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people. They even openly sit together with the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to hold meetings. All this further exposes their traitorous faces and their ugly role as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. To oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism. In the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, there is no middle road to take, and one cannot engage in any "joint actions" with the leadership of the CPSU.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee pointed out that at present, "various political forces are undergoing a great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization." This situation will inevitably lead to the great development of revolutionary forces in the world, the great collapse of imperialist forces, the great victory of Marxism-Leninism, and the great bankruptcy of modern revisionism. Although imperialism and its accomplices and running dogs will still struggle desperately and make ferocious counterattacks, the development of the international situation will still encounter various twists and turns. However, their ferocious counterattacks can only awaken the revolutionary people of various countries more greatly, promoting the broader and more intense revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries. The trend of imperialism heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism heading towards world victory is absolutely unchangeable. The world proletariat and revolutionary people, armed with and applying Mao Zedong Thought, this most powerful weapon, will unite and fight, and will definitely achieve the final victory.

VI. Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, and strive to build our army into an extremely proletarian and extremely militant army.

Our People's Liberation Army is the army of workers and peasants personally created by Chairman Mao, the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the current situation of a great revolutionary upsurge and extremely sharp and complex class struggles at home and abroad, our army is shouldering a glorious and great mission. We must, together with the people of the entire country, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, defending and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must implement Chairman Mao's instructions, turning our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We must firmly establish the idea of always being a combat team, according to Chairman Mao's great thought of people's war, solidly do a good job in war preparedness. We must definitely liberate Taiwan. We must be ready at any time to crush a possible sudden attack by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices.

How can we accomplish the glorious mission given to us by the Party and Chairman Mao?

First, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study Chairman Mao's works extensively, establish Mao Zedong Thought, and truly turn our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Since the cultural revolution, the people of the entire country have emerged in a new situation of studying Chairman Mao's works. Our army must hold the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works even more tightly, study it better, and pay more attention to implementation. We must, according to Comrade Lin Biao's instruction, study with problems, study and apply actively and practically, learn and apply together, learn urgently what is needed urgently, see results immediately, and focus on application. Especially the three works "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," everyone must study, study repeatedly, and apply repeatedly, doing a good job in the ideological revolution of people. We must forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, being good soldiers of Chairman Mao. We must regard studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as the most sublime revolutionary career and the most glorious combat mission of our lives.

Second, forever emphasize proletarian politics. We must firmly implement Chairman Mao's military thought and military line, firmly criticize various bourgeois military thoughts and military lines, and thoroughly eliminate the pernicious influence of the bourgeois military line. We must firmly implement Comrade Lin Biao's five principles of emphasizing politics, insist on the four firsts, carry forward the three-eight style, develop the three great democracies, and carry out the four-good company movement. We must put political and ideological work in the first place in all work, grasp living thoughts, do a good job in people's ideological work, and promote the further ideological revolution of the troops.

Third, forever maintain vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm. We must, according to Chairman Mao's teaching of wholeheartedly serving the people, devote ourselves to the revolution and the people, be extremely responsible for work, and be extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people. We must maintain and carry forward the style of being swift and decisive, and we must be daring and do it well. We must highly carry forward initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity, dare to take on heavy responsibilities, fear neither hardship nor death, dare to climb mountains of knives and walk on paths of fire, and resolutely accomplish all the tasks given to us by the Party and the people.

We must, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget emphasizing politics, and never forget holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

We must, under the wise leadership of our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander Chairman Mao, build our army into an extremely proletarian and extremely militant great revolutionary army, defending and building our ironclad proletarian state!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

    更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗  保卫和建设我们无产阶级铁打的江山
    ——庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年连队讲话材料
    我国七亿人民的光辉节日——中华人民共和国成立十七周年，就要到来了。
    今年，我们是在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，满怀革命豪情来欢庆这个伟大节日的。
    全国到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象，工农业生产蒸蒸日上，各个战线正在出现新的全面跃进的局面。
    全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，也是一片大好形势。
    我国人民革命事业所取得的一切成就，都是毛泽东思想的胜利，都是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央英明领导的结果。
    一、毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是共产主义运动中的伟大创举，是社会主义革命的伟大创举
    毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是我国社会主义革命发展的一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段，是共产主义运动中的伟大创举，是社会主义革命的伟大创举。
    这场文化大革命，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，是资产阶级阴谋复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争，是一场极其激烈、极其尖锐、极其深刻的阶级斗争。在我国无产阶级专政的条件下，资产阶级要想篡夺政权，总是要通过党内那些极少数走资本主义道路的当权派，即反革命的修正主义分子。混进党内的一小撮反革命的修正主义分子，是最主要的最危险的敌人。如果不把他们打倒，一旦有机可乘，他们就会像赫鲁晓夫一样，起来篡夺我们党和国家的领导权，使我们整个国家改变颜色。这次无产阶级文化大革命，就是要把钻进我们党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，统统揪出来，把埋藏在我们党内的定时炸弹，一个个地挖掉，防止反革命颠覆，巩固我们无产阶级铁打的江山。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是触及人们灵魂的大革命。毛主席说：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”在我国，资产阶级虽然已经被推翻，但是，他们人还在，心不死，总是企图用剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯，来腐蚀群众，征服人心，妄图达到他们反革命复辟的目的。我们在无产阶级文化大革命中，就是要大破一切剥削阶级的旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯，大立无产阶级的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯。一句话，就是要大立毛泽东思想。要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变整个社会的精神面貌，从根本上挖掉修正主义的根子，防止资本主义复辟，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。
    无产阶级文化大革命，也是做好迎击和粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶可能发动的突然进攻的最大最好的战备。
    毛主席指出，无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的根本矛盾，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾。运动的重点，是斗争那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派。
    一九六二年，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上，提出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大号召，给全党和全国人民指明了最坚定的方向。八届十中全会以后，在毛主席亲自领导下，开展了城乡社会主义教育运动，成为我国社会主义建设事业的推动力。一九六四年，党内出现了形“左”而实右的错误，毛主席亲自领导制定了二十三条，保证了社会主义教育运动在正确的轨道上前进。
    一九六五年下半年，毛主席亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，把我国社会主义革命推向一个新阶段。但是，那些走资本主义道路的当权派，那些资产阶级反动学术“权威”，顽固地站在反动立场上进行抵抗，疯狂镇压革命群众运动，妄图把这场轰轰烈烈的大革命打下去。在这关键的时刻，毛主席于一九六六年八月亲自主持召开了党的八届十一中全会，亲自主持制定了《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，即十六条。十六条总结了群众革命运动的新经验，纠正了错误的路线，扭转了错误的方向，指出了继续胜利前进的道路。无产阶级文化大革命开始了新的高潮。
    八月十八日、三十一日和九月十五日，我们伟大的领袖毛主席身着军装，同他的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央其他领导同志，在天安门广场，先后三次接见了首都和来自全国各地的红卫兵和革命师生，给了广大革命群众极大鼓舞。无产阶级文化大革命在全国范围内更加轰轰烈烈地开展起来。形势越来越好。
    毛主席对当前无产阶级文化大革命，给予了很高评价。毛主席说：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”
    在这场文化大革命的伟大群众运动中，广大工农兵是主力军。由大、中学校革命学生组成的红卫兵和其他青少年革命组织，成了文化大革命的急先锋。广大工农兵、革命学生和革命干部互相鼓舞，互相学习，互相支持，互相信赖，向走资本主义道路的当权派，向一切资产阶级顽固堡垒，向一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈冲击。在短短几个月内，已经取得了辉煌的战果。
    我们揪出了一个又一个党内走资本主义道路的当权派，捣毁了大大小小的“三家村”、“四家店”，揪出了形形色色的牛鬼蛇神，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    我们批判了学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界以及其他各种文化界的资产阶级反动学术“权威”，批判了许多坏戏、坏电影、坏作品。把资产阶级反动的“专家”、“学者”、“祖师爷”打得落花流水，威风扫地。
    我们正在对教育，对文艺，对一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑进行改革。
    敢闯、敢干、敢革命的红卫兵，由学校走上街头，大破“四旧”，大立“四新”。他们把那些走资本主义道路的当权派，资产阶级的反动“权威”，搞得狼狈不堪。那些躲藏在阴暗角落里的老寄生虫，吸血鬼，人民的仇敌，一个个地被揪了出来。他们隐藏的金银财宝，隐藏的各种变天账、杀人武器，被拿出来展览示众。红卫兵办了大量好事，提出了大量好倡议，建立了很大的功勋。广大红卫兵从革命中学会革命，在斗争中锻炼成长。
    无产阶级文化大革命，已经触及到政治，触及到经济。它正在有力地促进人的思想革命化，进一步解放社会生产力，成为我国社会生产力发展的一个强大推动力。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，震动了整个世界，使得帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派心惊胆战，使全世界革命人民受到莫大的鼓舞。
    我们人民解放军以高度的政治责任感和极大的革命热情，积极参加文化大革命。广大指战员在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，坚决地执行十六条，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，热情地支持左派，狠狠地打击右派和一切牛鬼蛇神，口诛笔伐资产阶级的反动思想，并使自己在斗争中得到锻炼，得到提高。我军指战员在同不拿枪的敌人斗争的同时，密切注视拿枪的敌人，严守战斗岗位，加强组织纪律性，保持高度集中统一，提高革命警惕，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的任何突然进攻，保卫我们无产阶级铁打的江山。我们决心响应毛主席的伟大号召，和全国人民一道，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    二、活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动，开创了劳动人民直接掌握和运用马列主义的新纪元
    全国范围亿万工农兵、革命知识分子和广大干部，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，正在汹涌澎湃地向前发展。这个伟大的群众运动，开创了劳动人民直接掌握和运用马克思列宁主义的新纪元。
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是全党全国一切工作的指导方针。
    广大工农兵、革命知识分子和广大干部对我们伟大的领袖毛主席无限热爱，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限忠诚。他们把毛主席的书当作自己一切行动的指南。他们说，毛主席是我们心中的红太阳。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。“千件事，万件事，读毛主席的书是最重要的事”。“干一辈子革命，就要学一辈子毛主席著作”。从城市到农村，从海防到边疆，各族人民、各行各业的革命同志都在学习毛主席著作。文化水平高的在学，文化水平低的，甚至不识字的也在学。全国出现了千千万万活学活用毛主席著作的先进人物和先进单位。
    几年来，我们人民解放军的全体指战员，热烈响应林彪同志提出的“高举毛泽东思想红旗，把毛泽东思想真正学到手”的号召，在全军掀起了规模宏大、持久不懈的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，推动我军在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路上迅速前进。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，我军好人好事层出不穷，英雄模范不断涌现。雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊等，就是出色的代表。在这些英雄人物的身上，鲜明地体现了毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。
    广大工人群众学了毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，进一步提高了无产阶级觉悟。他们发扬敢想、敢干的大无畏革命精神，闯“难关”，攻“堡垒”。大庆油田一二○二和一二○五钻井队，活学活用毛主席著作，只用七个多月时间，分别突破了钻井六万米的大关，远远超过了苏联一个钻井队创造的全年钻井四万○八百一十六米的最高纪录。上海工人出身的电光源专家蔡祖泉和他的战友，在毛泽东思想的指引下，打破帝国主义和现代修正主义的封锁，研制成功包括“小太阳”在内的十几种新型电光源，为我国发展新型照明技术做出了出色贡献。无数生动的事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国工人阶级，最勇敢，最聪明，能够攀登科学技术最高峰。
    广大农民群众活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，精神面貌发生了深刻变化。大寨人通过学习毛主席著作，树立了为革命种田的思想，使地瘦人穷的旧大寨，变成了集体经济大兴旺的社会主义新大寨。广东省博罗县黄山洞大队，社员群众学习毛主席著作，破私立公，心向集体，人人争当改天换地的“活愚公”，人人争做不怕困难的“好同志”。他们以奋发图强的革命精神，努力改变黄山洞的贫穷落后面貌，大搞农田水利建设，改变低产田为高产田，使水稻总产量翻了一番多。各地大量事实证明，农民一经用毛泽东思想武装起来，就可以摆脱私有观念的束缚，成为突出为公、热爱集体的革命化的新型农民。
    党的八届十一中全会强调指出：“全党全国大学毛泽东同志著作，是一个具有历史意义的重大事件。”
    全会指出：“林彪同志号召人民解放军在全军展开学习毛泽东同志著作的群众运动，为全党全国树立了光辉的榜样。”“对毛泽东同志著作，带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫的方法，是行之有效的，普遍适用的，应当进一步在全党全国推广。”
    全国人民热烈响应党中央的号召，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了一个崭新的局面。亿万人民以高度的革命热情，更加自觉地按照林彪同志提出的原则和方法，活学活用毛主席著作。在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，革命的小将红卫兵、革命师生和广大工农兵群众一起，大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想。在街道、广场、商店、工厂、学校和汽车、电车上，他们大读、大写、大贴、大学毛主席语录，到处是一片《毛主席语录》的红色海洋，到处是一片宣读毛主席语录的响亮声音，到处是赞颂伟大领袖毛主席的嘹亮歌声。他们把这场批判资产阶级的文化大革命，当成了活学活用毛泽东思想的最好的课堂。
    党中央为了满足广大人民群众学习毛主席著作的迫切需要，决定大量印刷发行毛主席著作，包括《毛泽东选集》和大量的《毛泽东著作选读》、《毛主席语录》。这是无产阶级文化大革命的一个巨大胜利，是全国人民一件大喜事。最近，全国各地已经开始大量供应毛主席著作，广大人民群众欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。他们说：“盼星星，盼月亮，毛主席的书，总算盼到了”，“革命舵手毛主席，四卷红书是真理，字字句句讲革命，世世代代不能离”。
    林彪同志提出，全党全国全军要大学大立毛泽东思想。他说：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。有了这个思想，才能保持旺盛的革命干劲，才有坚定正确的政治方向。”我们一定要响应林彪同志的号召，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作，抓得更紧，学得更好，用得更好，取得更大的成效。
    三、以毛泽东思想为指针，抓革命，促生产，全国各个战线出现新的全面跃进的局面
    我们搞社会主义，要从两条战线上向前进攻。一条是精神战线，一条是物质战线。精神战线是改造思想，提高无产阶级革命觉悟；物质战线是改造自然，发展社会主义国民经济。先进的思想领先。毛泽东思想就是引导我们在这两条战线上胜利前进的火车头。
    全国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动和伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，大大加速了人的思想革命化。毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成了伟大的物质力量。
    今年，是我国发展国民经济第三个五年计划的头一年。全国人民以毛泽东思想为指针，贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，抓革命，促生产，把在文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天革命干劲，用到工农业生产和科学实验的斗争中，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省，全国各个战线正在出现新的全面跃进的局面。
    在农业战线上，随着社会主义教育运动的深入开展，农村人民公社得到进一步巩固和发展。广大农村干部和社员，大力突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，学大寨，赶大寨，以大无畏精神，同各种自然灾害进行英勇顽强的斗争，连续四年取得了好收成。今年小麦、早稻等夏收作物，许多地方获得大面积、大幅度增产。南方的晚稻、杂粮，都生长良好，丰收在望。北方广大社员满怀喜悦的心情，开始收割玉米、谷子、高粱等大秋作物。南北棉区的棉花结桃累累，长势喜人。今年秋收丰产年景已定。林、牧、副、渔各行各业，以及农村的水利化、机械化、电气化等也都有了很大的发展。自力更生、艰苦奋斗、战天斗地、改变落后面貌的大寨式的先进单位到处涌现。
    在工业战线上，广大职工以大庆为榜样，按照毛泽东思想办社会主义企业。他们以政治统帅生产，大抓人的思想革命化，带动了生产大跃进，产品的数量、品种、质量，都有了很大的发展和提高。如钢铁工业今年头五个月生产的钢、钢材、生铁，比去年同期都有了大幅度增长，试制成功的钢材新品种，就有二百五十多种。普通低合金钢今年头五个月的产量，相当于去年全年产量的七倍。石油工业今年上半年生产的原油以及汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油等主要石油产品，比去年同期有很大增长，全都超额完成了国家计划。纺织工业今年头八个月生产的棉、毛、丝、麻、化学纤维、纺织机械等主要产品，都超额完成了国家计划，产量有较大幅度增长，质量稳定提高，成本下降。棉纱产量增长了百分之十八，比新中国成立以来任何一年产量都高。
    在工农业生产大发展的基础上，全国市场繁荣，物价稳定，到处是一片兴旺景象。
    在基本建设、交通运输、文教卫生、科学研究等方面，也都取得巨大的成就。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我国人民坚持自力更生的方针，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。许多我们过去没有的东西，现在已经有了；许多过去不能造的，现在也能造了。三次核爆炸的成功，集中地表现了我国科学技术发展的新水平，有力地回击了帝国主义、现代修正主义对我们的封锁破坏。
    毛主席说，代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的光辉成就，再一次证明，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，一旦被七亿人民所掌握，就能创造一切人间奇迹。
    四、把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校
    我们最伟大的领袖毛主席，最近指示我们：人民解放军应该是一个大学校，全国各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校。毛主席这个极其重要的指示，具有伟大的历史意义和战略意义，是我们的行动纲领。
    按照毛主席的指示去做，就可以大大提高无产阶级革命觉悟，促进全国人民的思想革命化，从而进一步多快好省地建设社会主义，铲除资本主义、修正主义的社会基础和思想基础。
    按照毛主席的指示去做，就可以逐步缩小工农之间、城乡之间、体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别，为逐步过渡到共产主义准备条件。
    按照毛主席的指示去做，就可以实现全民皆兵，大大加强我们的战备工作。
    按照毛主席的指示去做，我国七亿人民拿起锤子能做工，拿起锄头能种田，拿起枪杆能打敌人，拿起笔杆能写文章批判资产阶级。就可以培养和锻炼成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的、有高度政治觉悟的、全面发展的共产主义新人。
    毛主席的伟大指示，是我军几十年建军经验的最新总结，是毛主席一贯的建军思想在新的历史条件下的发展。毛主席的伟大指示下达后，我军上下闻风而动，认真学习，认真领会。各部队根据自己的具体情况，订出措施。全军按照林彪同志关于突出政治的指示，增加了政治教育时间，以毛主席著作为基本教材，既学政治，又学军事，又学文化。许多部队发扬既是战斗队、又是工作队、又是生产队的光荣传统，积极开展群众工作。在野营训练、助民劳动中，向广大人民宣传毛泽东思想，协助驻地群众举办学习毛主席著作夜校，并和群众同开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。搞好农副业生产，举办中小型工厂。积极参加农村和工厂的社会主义教育运动，参加批判资产阶级的文化大革命。广大指战员决心把我军办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校，使我军在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的道路上向更高阶段前进。
    毛主席的伟大号召，迅速地传遍了全国。广大人民欢欣鼓舞地称颂毛主席的指示，是“通向共产主义的金桥”，是“建设共产主义的蓝图”。大庆油田职工和家属，看到毛主席的指示以后，受到极大的鼓舞。钻井场上，采油井旁，到处喜气洋洋。六年来，在毛主席光辉思想的照耀下，大庆职工和家属，大学毛主席著作，又办工业，又办农业，工农结合，城乡结合。他们办起的一个又一个的工农村，被大家称为城市型的乡村，乡村型的城市。他们大办民兵，又学文，又练武。在文化大革命中，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，批判资产阶级，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。广大职工说：毛主席在指示里提到了大庆，给我们提出了更高的要求。有毛主席的英明领导，过去我们能拿下世界第一流的大油田，建设了城乡结合、工农结合的新型矿区，今后也一定能把油田办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    全国各行各业、各个战线都在采取具体措施，贯彻执行毛主席的指示，更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作。许多厂矿企业以工为主，兼搞农副业生产。人民公社以农为主，举办小型工厂。各地学校的革命师生，决心学工、学农、学军，使教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合。各行各业都大办民兵，积极参加文化大革命，批判资产阶级。广大工农群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，决心把各行各业都办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校，为实现毛主席提出的伟大历史任务而斗争。
    五、毛泽东思想光辉普照全球，全世界一片大好革命形势
    当前，我们正处在世界革命的一个新时代。全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，呈现着一派大好形势。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想鼓舞着全世界人民的革命斗争，成为世界各国革命人民最宝贵的共同财富和最强大的力量源泉，成为全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最强大、最锐利的思想武器。
    世界各国人民无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想。他们热烈地歌颂毛主席是“当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者”，是“世界各国人民的伟大领袖和导师”，“世界革命航船上的伟大舵手”，是“世界人民心中永远不落的红太阳”。毛泽东思想是“指导世界革命的普遍真理”，“全世界人民只有跟着毛泽东思想伟大旗帜前进，才能取得彻底解放”。
    许多马克思列宁主义兄弟党，积极号召全党学习毛主席著作。亚非拉广大革命人民，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，把毛主席著作作为他们闹革命求解放的必读教材。许多革命战士在弹雨纷飞的战场上，随身携带着毛主席军事著作，边战斗，边学习。许多革命者带着毛主席著作深入山区，发动农民进行斗争。在敌人的监狱里，在残酷的白色恐怖下，许多革命者冒着生命危险，秘密传阅着毛主席著作。
    据不完全统计，目前，全世界有六十多个国家和地区，用六十多种文字，出版和发行了毛主席著作共六百多种。毛主席的书，已经成了世界革命人民最爱读的革命宝书。
    毛主席说：“现在是全世界资本主义和帝国主义走向灭亡，全世界社会主义和人民民主主义走向胜利的历史时代”。“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。国际局势的发展，完全证实了毛主席这一伟大的科学预见。
    现在，世界各国人民的革命运动，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命运动，正在蓬勃发展。全世界革命人民同以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利。一个新的更大的反美革命风暴正在全世界兴起。
    越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是当前世界人民反美斗争的焦点。在那里，人民战争的战略正在战胜美帝国主义的反革命全球战略。英雄的越南人民既不屈服于美帝国主义的军事压力，也不受美帝国主义的“和谈”欺骗，把号称当今资本主义世界的头号强国打得内外交困，一筹莫展。约翰逊政府增兵十万不行，二十万不行，现在增加到三十多万，还是不行。美国侵略军的有生力量被大量消灭，已经报销了七万来人。越南人民的伟大胜利，有力地打击、牵制和削弱了美帝国主义的侵略力量，打乱了美国的全球侵略计划和战争部署，大大地鼓舞和支援了世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”
    现在，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，到处燃起了武装斗争的熊熊烈火。老挝、泰国、北加里曼丹、马来亚、菲律宾、南也门、阿曼、刚果（利）、安哥拉、葡属几内亚、莫三鼻给、卡奔达、赤道几内亚、津巴布韦、多米尼加、哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉、危地马拉、洪都拉斯、尼加拉瓜、秘鲁、巴拉圭等二十多个国家和地区的革命人民，已经纷纷走上了武装斗争的道路，拿起武器，狠狠地打击帝国主义及其走狗。
    西欧、北美和大洋洲资本主义国家的工人阶级和劳动人民，反对美帝国主义和本国垄断资本的斗争正在广泛展开。美国人民反对约翰逊政府侵略越南和美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争，此伏彼起。帝国主义国家之间的矛盾，特别是美法之间的矛盾，达到了第二次世界大战后空前激烈的程度。美帝国主义空前孤立，日子越来越不好过。
    全世界马克思列宁主义者反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，正在胜利发展。马克思列宁主义的队伍不断壮大，现代修正主义集团不断削弱。苏共新领导坚持实行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫主义。他们的路线就是，在资本主义世界维护帝国主义、殖民主义统治，在社会主义世界实行资本主义复辟。他们比赫鲁晓夫更坏，地位更虚弱，处境更困难。他们在苏联国内加紧推行复辟资本主义的修正主义政策，使苏联在向资本主义倒退的路上越走越远。他们勾结美帝国主义，东联日本军国主义，西联西德军国主义，南联印度反动派，拼凑反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的反动同盟。他们出卖多米尼加、刚果（利）和南罗得西亚等国人民的革命利益。在越南抗美斗争的问题上，苏共新领导玩弄假支持、真出卖的反革命两面手法，为美帝国主义的“和谈”骗局效劳，千方百计地帮助美帝国主义，妄图扑灭越南人民的革命烈火。他们甚至公然和蒋介石匪帮的代表坐在一起开会。所有这一切，都进一步暴露了他们的工贼面目和充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。在马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义的斗争中，决没有中间道路可走，决不能同苏共领导搞什么“联合行动”。
    党的八届十一中全会公报指出，目前世界“各种政治力量正在经历着一个大动荡、大分化、大改组的局面”。这种局面，必将导致世界革命力量的大发展，帝国主义力量的大崩溃，马克思列宁主义的大胜利，现代修正主义的大破产。尽管帝国主义及其帮凶和走狗还会进行垂死的挣扎，疯狂的反扑，国际形势的发展还会出现各种曲折和反复。但是，它们这种疯狂的反扑，只能促使各国革命人民更大的觉醒，促进各国革命人民更广泛更剧烈的革命。帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的总趋势，是绝对改变不了的。世界无产阶级和革命人民掌握和运用毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器，团结战斗，一定能够取得最后胜利。
    六、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，大鼓干劲，为把我军建设得非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化而奋斗
    我们人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的工人农民的军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石。在当前的一片大好革命形势下，在国内外极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争情况下，我军担负着极其光荣而伟大的使命。我们要和全国人民一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保卫和巩固无产阶级专政。要贯彻执行毛主席的指示，把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校。要牢固地树立永远是战斗队的思想，按照毛主席人民战争的伟大思想，扎扎实实地做好战备。我们一定要解放台湾。我们一定要随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶可能发动的突然袭击。
    怎样才能圆满完成党和毛主席给予我们的光荣任务呢？
    一、永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想，真正把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校。文化大革命以来，全国人民学习毛主席著作出现了新的局面。我们军队要把毛泽东思想红旗举得更高，要把学习毛主席著作抓得更紧，学得更好，更讲究落实。我们一定要按照林彪同志的指示，带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。特别是《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》这三篇著作，人人都要学，反复学，反复用，搞好人的思想革命化。我们要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。要把学习毛泽东思想，贯彻毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想，当作毕生最崇高的革命事业，最光荣的战斗任务。
    二、永远突出无产阶级政治。我们要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的建军思想、建军路线，坚决批判形形色色的资产阶级军事思想、军事路线，彻底肃清资产阶级军事路线的恶劣影响。我们要坚决贯彻执行林彪同志突出政治的五项原则，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动。要把政治思想工作摆在一切工作的首位，抓好活思想，做好人的思想工作，促进部队的思想进一步革命化。
    三、永远保持旺盛的革命干劲。我们要按照毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，一心为革命，一心为人民，对工作极端负责，对同志、对人民极端热忱。要保持和发扬迅速果敢、雷厉风行的作风，说干就干，干就干好。要高度发扬主动性、积极性、创造性，勇于挑重担，一不怕苦，二不怕死，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，坚决完成党和人民所交给的一切任务。
    我们要遵照党中央的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    我们要在我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席的英明领导下，把我军建设成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的伟大革命军队，保卫和建设我们无产阶级铁打的江山！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
