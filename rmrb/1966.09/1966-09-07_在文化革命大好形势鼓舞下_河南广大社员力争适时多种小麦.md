In the great momentum of the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of peasants in Henan, the largest wheat-producing area in China, are high-spirited under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are actively preparing for the winter wheat sowing, striving to plant wheat in a timely manner, and aiming for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

Not long ago, various places in Henan summarized the experience of this year's wheat harvest. The peasants said: The first and most important experience of a bumper harvest is to emphasize politics and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Therefore, in the preparation for this year's wheat sowing, the broad masses of rural cadres and peasants have seriously studied Chairman Mao's works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "In Service of the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and the commentary on the article "Who Says the Chicken's Feather Cannot Fly." They have held many study sessions on Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of thought. Many places also used the methods of big debates, big discussions, and big arguments to find the reasons for backward production, promoting the revolutionization of leadership thought.

In the current high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution, the rural cadres and peasants in Henan Province are determined to learn from the daring, bold, and revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, breaking the old ideas, old habits, and old farming systems in production struggles, and establishing new ideas, new habits, and new farming systems that are suitable for socialist large-scale agriculture. To achieve reasonable dense planting, many regions have reformed the sowing tool, changing the original leg spacing from seven inches to five inches. Zhoukou Prefecture plans to reform 80,000 sowing tools, and most of them have been completed. In addition, various places have universally carried out reasonable crop rotation, green manure sowing, deep plowing and soil improvement, and land leveling.

In the past two months, most of Henan has not had sufficient rain, and the broad masses of cadres and peasants have prepared for drought-resistant wheat planting. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings, determined to overcome all difficulties and ensure the timely completion of the wheat planting task.

    在文化革命大好形势鼓舞下
    河南广大社员力争适时多种小麦
    新华社郑州六日电  我国最大的小麦产区河南省，广大社员在文化大革命大好形势鼓舞下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极做好冬小麦播种准备工作，力争适时多种小麦，争取明年小麦丰收。
    不久以前，河南各地总结了今年小麦丰收的经验。社员们说：丰收的经验第一条，也是最重要的一条，是突出政治、活学活用毛主席著作。因此，在今年小麦播种准备工作中，广大农村干部和社员认真学习了毛主席的《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》和《谁说鸡毛不能上天》一文的按语等著作，多次举行了毛主席著作讲用会，促进思想革命化。许多地方还用大鸣、大放、大辩论的方法，寻找生产落后的原因，促进领导思想革命化。
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，河南省的农村干部和社员决心学习红卫兵小将们的敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的无产阶级革命精神，大破生产斗争当中的旧思想、旧习惯、旧的耕作制度，大立与社会主义大农业相适应的新思想、新习惯、新的耕作制度。为了做到合理密植，很多地区改革了播种耧，把原来的耧腿距离由七寸宽改为五寸宽。周口专区计划改耧八万张，现已大部改制完成。此外，各地还普遍地进行了合理倒茬、播种绿肥、深翻改土和平整土地的工作。
    近两月以来，河南大部地区未落透雨，广大干部社员作好了抗旱种麦的准备。他们按照毛主席的教导，下定决心，排除万难，保证适时完成种麦任务。
