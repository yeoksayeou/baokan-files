	Dear Chairman Mao, we will report back after a good harvest.

	Zhang Zhuoxin
	Member of the Zhong-Alu Friendship People's Commune

	After watching the feature documentary "Chairman Mao and the Million Strong Cultural Revolution Army," I couldn't help but shout: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao has once again received us. This is not just watching a movie; I feel as if I have returned to that happy day of August 18th. On that day, more than a hundred poor and lower-middle peasants from the Zhong-Alu Friendship People's Commune stood in front of Tiananmen Gate. Seeing Chairman Mao wearing the red armband of the Red Guards, our hearts boiled over. Now, from the movie, I see him more clearly with the revolutionary masses, heart to heart with us poor and lower-middle peasants. I instantly felt a warm current surging through my body, and tears of excitement welled up in my eyes again and again.

	Look, he is radiant and full of vigor, in the best of health. Chairman Mao being so healthy is our greatest happiness, the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and all revolutionary people around the world. I sincerely wish him a long, long life!

	Look, he is wearing a new military uniform, adorned with a bright red badge and a red star cap insignia, together with the million-strong Cultural Revolution Army, jointly celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the greatest trust, the greatest expectation, and the greatest encouragement for us revolutionary masses.

	I am a demobilized soldier. Our troops are personally created and led by Chairman Mao. Under Chairman Mao's leadership and command, our People's Liberation Army has always been invincible. In this unprecedented cultural revolution that touches people's souls, Chairman Mao is once again our supreme commander. I feel especially close to him, filled with confidence and courage in victory. Dear Chairman Mao! I will definitely respond to your great call, care about state affairs, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end; I will be a critic of the old world and a creator of the new world, daring to think, speak, act, venture, and revolutionize; firmly breaking down the old ideas of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and establishing the new ideas of the proletariat, establishing Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao, we pledge to you: for a lifetime, we will read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, and dedicate our lives to the revolution! We will also farm well, produce more grain, especially now that the "three autumns" are approaching. We will definitely follow your teachings, seize the revolution, and promote production. We will have a good harvest and plant this year's winter wheat, and then report back to you!

    敬爱的毛主席我们收好秋再向您汇报
    中阿友好人民公社社员　张卓新
    看到大型纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》，我禁不住要欢呼：毛主席，毛主席，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席又一次接见我们了。这那是在看电影，我是又回到了八月十八日这个幸福的日子。八月十八日那一天，我们中阿友好人民公社的一百多个贫下中农站在天安门前，看到毛主席戴上了红卫兵的袖章，我们的心都沸腾起来了。现在我从电影上更清楚地看到他老人家和革命群众在一起，和我们贫下中农心连心，我顿时觉着一股暖流传遍全身，激动地一次又一次流出了兴奋的热泪。
    看，他老人家神采奕奕，红光满面，健康极了。毛主席这样健康，这是我们最大的幸福，是中国人民、全世界革命人民最大的幸福。我衷心地祝愿他老人家万寿无疆！
    看，他老人家穿着崭新的军装，佩戴着鲜红的领章和红星帽徽，同百万文化革命大军在一起，共同庆祝无产阶级文化大革命。这是对我们革命群众的最大的信任，最大的期望，最大的鼓舞。
    我是个复员军人。我们部队是毛主席亲手缔造和领导的。在毛主席的领导和指挥下，我们人民解放军从来都是所向无敌。在这场史无前例的触及人们灵魂的文化大革命中，毛主席又是我们的最高司令，我感到格外亲切，充满了胜利的信心和勇气。敬爱的毛主席啊！我一定响应您的伟大号召，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；誓做旧世界的批判者，新世界的创造者，敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命、敢斗争；坚决大破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想，大立无产阶级的新思想，大立毛泽东思想。
    毛主席，我们向您宣誓：一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，干一辈子革命！还要种好田，多打粮食，特别是当前“三秋”即将来临，我们一定遵循您的教导，抓革命，促生产。我们收好秋，种好今年的冬小麦后再向您汇报！
