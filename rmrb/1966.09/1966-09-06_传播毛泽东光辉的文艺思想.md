Late July and early August were the golden season in Zambia. The Chinese Folk Song and Dance Troupe, carrying the deep affection of 700 million Chinese people, arrived in the heart of Africa – the Zambian plateau. Chinese artists performed in 20 shows in the Zambian capital and six other cities, receiving extremely warm and friendly hospitality and welcome from the Zambian people.

The performers of the Chinese Folk Song and Dance Troupe were deeply moved by the broad Zambian audience's love and respect for the most beloved great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. Whenever Mao Zedong's portrait appeared on the stage backdrop, Zambian audiences repeatedly applauded with thunderous applause. Some audience members stood up to wave at Mao Zedong's portrait and shouted, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" Zambian friends particularly liked the songs "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," "Mao Zedong Thought Shines Brilliantly," and "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing," which reflect the Chinese people's love for Chairman Mao. A Zambian musician said, "From your moving and powerful voices, I feel that you have the deepest love for the great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong."

The Zambian people highly praised the revolutionary song and dance art nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought. The dance "Fighting Africa," which praises the African people's courageous struggle against imperialism and colonialism, was warmly welcomed by the audience. When they saw the scene of African freedom fighters breaking their chains and taking up arms to fight bravely, they could not help but express their deep national sentiments. They repeatedly waved their fists and cheered. A Zambian teacher said, "Your performance shows our struggle for freedom and gives us more strength." A student said, "Chairman Mao and the Chinese people truly support the African national liberation struggle."

The Zambian people shouted that the Chinese Folk Song and Dance Troupe "brought Mao Zedong's brilliant artistic thoughts to Zambia," praising Chinese song and dance art as "full of revolutionary spirit and internationalism," and saying that "revolutionary Africa needs this revolutionary art." Many Zambian friends said that after watching these performances, they understood the Chinese people better, understood the Chinese people's support for the African people, and thus loved and respected Chairman Mao even more, believing in Chairman Mao's teachings even more.

    传播毛泽东光辉的文艺思想
    七月底八月初，正是赞比亚的黄金季节。满载七亿中国人民深情厚谊的中国民间歌舞团来到了非洲的心脏——赞比亚高原。中国艺术工作者从赞比亚首都到其他六个城市先后进行了二十场访问演出，受到了赞比亚人民极为热情友好的接待和欢迎。
    中国民间歌舞团的演员们，深深为赞比亚广大观众热爱和尊敬中国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东主席而感动。每当舞台背景上出现毛主席肖像时，赞比亚观众一再报以长时间的雷鸣般的掌声。有些观众还站起来向毛主席像挥手致意，高呼“毛泽东！毛泽东！”赞比亚朋友非常欢喜《大海航行靠舵手》、《毛泽东思想闪金光》和《在北京的金山上》等反映中国人民热爱毛主席的歌曲。一位赞比亚音乐工作者说：“从你们动人而有力的声音中，我感到你们对伟大的革命领袖毛泽东怀有最真挚的爱”。
    赞比亚人民对于在毛泽东思想哺育下的中国革命歌舞艺术给予高度评价。歌颂非洲人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义的英勇斗争精神的舞蹈《战斗的非洲》，受到广大观众热烈欢迎。当他们看到非洲自由战士打碎锁链，拿起武器进行英勇斗争的场面时，都情不自禁地流露了他们深厚的民族感情。他们不断挥舞着拳头欢呼。一位赞比亚教师说，“你们的演出表现了我们争取自由的斗争，并且使我们增添了力量。”一位学生说：“毛主席和中国人民真正支持非洲的民族解放斗争。”
    赞比亚人民欢呼中国民间歌舞团“给赞比亚带来了毛泽东的光辉的文艺思想”，赞扬中国的歌舞艺术“充满着革命精神和国际主义精神”，“革命的非洲最需要这种革命艺术”，“反对殖民主义的共同斗争，把我们连结在一起了”。许多赞比亚朋友说，他们看了这些歌舞节目之后，更加了解中国人民，更加了解中国人民对非洲人民的支持，从而更加热爱和尊敬毛主席，更加信仰毛主席的教导。　新华社记者
