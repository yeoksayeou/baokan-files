Studying Chairman Mao's works makes everything clear; following Chairman Mao's words brings success. Early rice harvests are bountiful in Suixi County, Guangdong.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 7th: The cadres and community members of Suixi County, Guangdong Province, have studied Chairman Mao's works extensively, promoted the revolution, and boosted production, achieving a significant harvest after emphasizing politics. This year, early rice production increased by 44% on top of last year's 60% increase. As people celebrate the harvest, they all say this is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Starting from last autumn, Suixi County launched a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works. In half a year, the county and commune party committees trained 28,000 grassroots cadres and 72,000 active learners in batches. With this strong core team leading the way, almost all adults and young people in the county regularly study Chairman Mao's works. In the past, the focus of various levels of leadership was on urging plowing and sowing, which led to long-term lagging and passive production. Now, various levels of leadership have focused on using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and transform people, fundamentally changing people's spiritual outlook. There is a great political atmosphere with increasingly thick political air and more good people and good deeds. Production work has never been so proactive. When people talk about the changes in production, they unanimously say: Studying Chairman Mao's works makes everything clear, following Chairman Mao's words brings success.

    读毛主席的书一通百通　听毛主席的话一灵百灵
    广东遂溪县早稻大丰收
    据新华社广州七日电　广东省遂溪县广大干部和社员大学毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，夺得了突出政治以后的第一个大丰收。今年早稻在去年增产六成多的基础上，又增产百分之四十四。人们在欢庆丰收的时候，都说这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    从去年秋天开始，遂溪县农村掀起了大学毛主席著作的群众运动。半年中，县委和公社党委分批集训了二万八千多名基层干部、七万二千多名学习积极分子。在这支强大的骨干队伍带动下，全县绝大多数成年和青少年经常学习毛主席的著作。过去，各级领导的精力集中于催耕催种，生产反而长期落后被动。现在，各级领导抓了用毛泽东思想教育人、改造人这个根本，人的精神面貌大变化，出现了政治空气越来越浓、好人好事越来越多的大好政治局面，生产工作也空前未有的主动。人们谈起生产面貌的变化，就不约而同地说：读毛主席的书一通百通，听毛主席的话一灵百灵。
