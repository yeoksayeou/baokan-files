The General Staff and General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a reception on the evening of September 21 to warmly welcome the Vietnamese People's Army delegation and the Korean People's Army delegation who came to participate in the friendly radio telegraphy contest among friendly armies.

Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Zhang Zongxun, on behalf of the General Staff, General Political Department, and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended a warm welcome and cordial greetings to the heroic Vietnamese People's Army delegation and the Korean People's Army delegation from the front lines of the anti-American struggle.

Zhang Zongxun said, holding the friendly radio telegraphy contest among friendly armies during the great proletarian cultural revolution in our country makes us very happy. The Soviet modern revisionists deliberately sabotaged this competition, which only exposes their ugly faces of false unity and true division. We are convinced that through this friendly contest, it will definitely make more beneficial contributions to strengthening the fraternal combat friendship between the peoples and armies of the three countries and to improving the technical level of our radio sports.

The leader of the Vietnamese People's Army delegation, Major Huang Caidong, and the leader of the Korean People's Army delegation, Major Li Genchan, made toasts at the reception, wishing for the further development of the combat unity and friendship between the peoples and armies of China, Vietnam, and Korea. Huang Caidong emphasized in his toast that recently, American aggressor planes have blatantly carried out serious military provocations against the People's Republic of China, which makes the Vietnamese people and army extremely indignant. If the U.S. imperialists stubbornly continue to invade Vietnam and infringe on Chinese territory, the Vietnamese people will, together with their brotherly Chinese people, give the American aggressors a fatal blow.

Attending the reception were Jia Ruoyu, Huang Wenming, Su Huancui, Zhao Zhenghong, Han Fudong, Liu Han, Li Wei, and other relevant leaders.

Colonel Chen Wenpeng, military attaché of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China, and Colonel Choi Jihyeong, military attaché of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's embassy in China, were also invited to attend the reception.

    张宗逊谴责苏修对友军友谊赛的破坏活动
    据新华社二十一日讯  中国人民解放军总参谋部、总政治部，今天晚上举行招待会，热烈欢迎前来参加友军无线电快速收发报友谊赛的越南人民军代表队和朝鲜人民军代表队。
    中国人民解放军副总参谋长张宗逊代表总参谋部、总政治部和中国人民解放军全体指战员，向来自反美斗争最前线的英雄的越南人民军代表队和朝鲜人民军代表队，表示热烈的欢迎和亲切的问候。
    张宗逊说，友军无线电快速收发报友谊赛，在我国轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中举行，我们感到非常高兴。苏联现代修正主义者蓄意破坏这次比赛，只能暴露他们假团结、真分裂的丑恶嘴脸。我们坚信，通过这次友谊赛，对加强我们三国人民及其军队之间的兄弟般的战斗友谊，对提高我们无线电运动的技术水平，一定会做出更加有益的贡献。
    越南人民军代表队领队黄才龙中校和朝鲜人民军代表队领队李根产中校，在会上祝酒，为中越朝三国人民和军队之间的战斗的团结友谊的日益发展干杯。黄才龙在祝酒时强调指出，最近以来，美国强盗飞机公然对中华人民共和国进行严重的军事挑衅，我们越南人民和军队感到万分愤慨。如果美帝国主义顽固地继续侵略越南和侵犯中国领土，越南人民将同兄弟的中国人民一起给予美国侵略者以致命的打击。
    出席招待会的有贾若瑜、黄文明、苏焕清、赵正洪、韩复东、刘汉、李伟等有关方面负责人。
    越南民主共和国驻我国大使馆武官陈文彭上校和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使馆武官崔济荣上校应邀出席了今天的招待会。
