Tokyo, September 29 (Xinhua) - Thirty-two Japanese figures from various circles issued a statement in Tokyo on September 26, condemning the recent trend within Japan's Sino-Japanese friendship movement to obstruct Sino-Japanese friendship and exchanges. They pointed out that this trend makes the U.S.-Japan reactionaries happy and helps them carry out their anti-China policies. The statement emphasized that the Sino-Japanese friendship movement cannot be stopped by anyone.

The statement said, "Promoting friendship and exchanges between Japan and China, and strengthening the unity of the two peoples, is a major issue that cannot be ignored for even a single day in postwar Japan for those who seriously consider problems and truly love their country. It reflects the wishes of the vast majority of the people who are determined not to follow the old path of Japanese militarists, from invasion to destruction."

The statement pointed out that at a time when U.S. imperialism is continuing to escalate the Vietnam War, "if the broad masses of the Japanese people defend and expand the fortress of Sino-Japanese friendship, this not only serves the interests of the two peoples but also provides tremendous support to the Vietnamese people and is an important contribution to peace and liberation in Asia."

The statement said, "The forces that follow the U.S. government will certainly intensify their obstruction of Sino-Japanese friendship and exchanges. The conspiracy of the 'two Chinas,' disguised in various ways, will also be carried out more vigorously. 'At present, to further promote the movement of Sino-Japanese friendship and exchanges, it is necessary to overcome the obstacles that have arisen within the movement in Japan. Recently, even within our movement, there has been a tendency to create various pretexts to obstruct the development of friendly exchanges. Such a tendency is nothing but making the U.S.-Japan reactionary forces happy and helping them carry out their anti-China policies.'"

The statement said: "The Sino-Japanese friendship movement has already accumulated enough strength to overcome any pressure and has the experience of not being deceived by any conspiracy. This national movement, regardless of who tries to obstruct it, will continue to expand, deepen, and develop. This is an irresistible historical trend that no one can stop."

The statement was signed by figures such as Nakajima Kenzo, Miyazaki Seimin, Kuroda Judo, Sasaki Saizo, Shiraishi Bann, Sakamoto Tokumatsu, Kamei Shoichiro, Kobayashi Yuichi, and Ota Kun. They called on people from various circles in Japan to, before China's National Day, confidently advance the great cause of Sino-Japanese friendship. They also expressed their belief that more and more people will sign this statement.

    日本各界人士谴责有人企图从内部阻挠日中人民友好运动
    阻挡日中友好就是帮助美日反动派反华
    新华社二十九日讯　东京消息：日本各界人士三十二人二十六日在东京发表声明，谴责最近在日本的日中友好运动内部出现的极力阻挠日中友好和往来的倾向，指出这种倾向使美日反动派高兴，帮助它们执行反华政策。声明指出，日中友好运动是谁也阻挡不了的。
    声明说，“推进日本和中国的友好和往来，加强两国人民的团结，这在战后的日本，对于一切认真考虑问题、真正爱国的人来说，是一天也不容忽视的重大事情。它反映了决心不再走过去日本军国主义者从侵略走向毁灭的老路的绝大多数国民的愿望。”
    声明指出，在美帝国主义继续扩大侵越战争的时候，“如果广大的日本人民保卫和扩大日中友好的堡垒，那么，这不仅符合两国人民的利益，而且是对越南人民的巨大支援，是对亚洲的和平与解放的重要贡献。”
    声明说，专门追随美国政府的势力，肯定会加紧阻挠日中友好和往来。处心积虑地用各种伪装打扮起来的“两个中国”的阴谋也将变本加厉地推行。“目前，为了进一步推进日中友好和往来的运动，必须克服在日本的运动内部产生的障碍。在我们的运动内部，最近也产生了制造种种借口，企图极力阻挠开展友好和往来活动的倾向。这样的倾向不外乎是使美日反动势力高兴，帮助它们执行反华政策。”
    声明说：“日中友好运动已经具备了足以战胜任何压力的力量，积累了不受任何阴谋欺骗的经验。这个国民运动，不管阻挡它的人是谁，都将越来越扩大、加深和发展。这是任何人也阻挡不了的强大的历史潮流。”
    在声明上签字的有中岛健藏、宫崎世民、黑田寿男、佐佐木更三、白石凡、坂本德松、龟井胜一郎、小林雄一、太田熏等人。他们呼吁日本各界人士在中国国庆节前，满怀信心地把日中友好的伟大事业推向前进。他们还表示相信，愈来愈多的人将在这项声明上签名。
