Various Red Guards and revolutionary students from different regions who came to Beijing have brought back important experiences from the Cultural Revolution. They will model the execution of the Sixteen Points, enthusiastically propagate the Sixteen Points, and use the Sixteen Points to arm themselves and mobilize the masses. This will ensure that the Cultural Revolution in their respective regions and units is carried out thoroughly and deeply.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 9th, as the Cultural Revolution enters a new high tide and advances further, Red Guards and revolutionary students from various regions have unanimously expressed their determination to model the execution of the Sixteen Points, which were personally drafted by Chairman Mao, and to enthusiastically propagate the Sixteen Points. They will become red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought and the Sixteen Points.

Red Guards and revolutionary students from various regions who went to Beijing for revolutionary linkage have, in recent days, continued to return to their battle stations. Upon their return, they have enthusiastically reported the revolutionary experiences from Beijing to their fellow Red Guards and revolutionary students in their schools and regions. Together, they have studied Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points in depth, combining their study with actual struggles. They believe that as long as they strictly implement the Sixteen Points in their struggles and widely propagate them, making the Sixteen Points known to every household, and fully mobilizing the revolutionary masses, they will definitely be able to carry out the Cultural Revolution thoroughly and deeply in their regions and units.

In recent days, the Red Guards and revolutionary youth in Tianjin have, after listening to the reports from their comrades who went to Beijing, launched a high tide of actively learning and applying the Sixteen Points and vigorously propagating the Sixteen Points. Over a hundred primary and secondary schools have organized propaganda teams, groups, and stations to carry out extensive propaganda activities. They say: As long as we give the Sixteen Points to the revolutionary masses, arm the revolutionary masses with the Sixteen Points, and let the broad revolutionary masses take action to make the revolution, we will definitely be able to thoroughly expose and overthrow, smash, and disgrace all monsters and demons. The Red Guards of the Dongfanghong Military School, after seriously studying the Sixteen Points, have expressed their determination: To achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution, we must study, be familiar with, master, and strictly implement the Party's policies. Only in this way can we advance the revolution.

Then, based on the situation of the struggle, they formulate a plan of action for the day. In recent days, revolutionary youngsters from various schools who returned from Beijing have also gone to the streets to distribute leaflets, post slogans, and make broadcasts, propagating the Sixteen Points to the broad revolutionary masses.

Upon returning to school, they immediately summarized their revolutionary activities from the previous stage with all the school's Red Guards and revolutionary students. Red Guards from Hubei College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, on their way back to Wuhan from Beijing, compared the revolutionary experiences of the Red Guards in the capital with the actual situation of their unit, item by item. Upon returning to school, they immediately reported to everyone. The revolutionary students of these schools have all expressed their determination to strictly implement the Sixteen Points and better propagate the Sixteen Points, launching a new high tide of the Cultural Revolution.

Many colleges and universities in Chengdu have been greatly inspired after listening to the reports from the Red Guards who returned from Beijing. They are determined to turn Chairman Mao's concern into an inexhaustible source of strength. In the struggle, they will read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They will strictly implement the Sixteen Points. They have also expressed their determination to fully utilize the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, and big propaganda to overthrow, smash, and disgrace all monsters and demons in their regions and units.

They will use Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible ideological weapon, to recognize everything, penetrate everything, criticize everything, and transform everything. They will be red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought for life.
