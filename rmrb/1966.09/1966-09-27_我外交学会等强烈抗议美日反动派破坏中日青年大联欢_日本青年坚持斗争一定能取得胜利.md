	The Chinese Association of International Relations and the Chinese Association of Political Science and Law today separately sent telegrams to relevant organizations in Japan, firmly supporting the just struggle of Japanese youth to come to China to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. The telegrams stated that as long as the Japanese people and youth strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, they will definitely achieve final victory.

	The Chinese Association of International Relations, in its telegram, strongly protested against the Sato government's violation of the wishes of the Japanese people and youth, and its brazen sabotage of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. The telegram said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'It is impossible to persuade imperialists and Chinese reactionaries to have good intentions and turn back. The only way is to organize forces to struggle against them...' Japanese youth must carry out a courageous and unyielding struggle to break through the obstruction and sabotage by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the Soviet modern revisionists and their various new and old followers."

	The telegram from the Chinese Association of Political Science and Law said that for a long time, the Sato government has followed U.S. imperialism, been hostile to the Chinese people, and sabotaged the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. This time, the Sato government's unreasonable obstruction and sabotage of Japanese youth coming to China to participate in the festival once again exposed its extremely hostile and ugly reactionary face towards the peoples of China and Japan. The telegram quoted a passage from Chairman Mao: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause, and they will not deviate from this logic." The telegram pointed out that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' plot to sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship will inevitably be completely foiled in the face of the struggle of the Japanese people.

	The telegrams from the Association of International Relations and the Association of Political Science and Law were sent to the Youth Bureau of the Japanese Socialist Party, the Socialist Youth League of Japan, the Socialist Study Society of Hokkaido, Japan, the Socialist Study Society of Fukui, Japan, the National Liaison Conference Against Military Bases in Japan, the Central Labor and Peasant Conference of Japan, the National "Friends of Study" Association (Labor University) of Japan, the Youth Problem Research Association of Japan, the National Liaison Council of Social Organizations in Japan, the Association of Young Jurists in Japan, and the National Federation of Constitutionalists in Japan.

    我外交学会等强烈抗议美日反动派破坏中日青年大联欢
    日本青年坚持斗争一定能取得胜利
    新华社二十六日讯  中国人民外交学会和中国政治法律学会，今天分别打电报给日本有关团体，坚决支持日本青年为争取来我国参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢而进行的正义斗争。电报指出，日本人民和青年只要加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能取得最后胜利。
    中国人民外交学会在电报中强烈抗议日本佐藤政府违背日本人民和青年的愿望，悍然破坏第二届中日青年友好大联欢的罪行。电报说，毛主席教导我们：“希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争……”日本青年只有开展英勇不屈的斗争，才能冲破美日反动派和苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者的阻挠和破坏。
    中国政治法律学会的电报说，长期以来，佐藤政府追随美帝国主义，敌视中国人民，破坏中日人民的友好关系。这次佐藤政府无理阻挠和破坏日本青年来华参加大联欢，再一次暴露了它极端仇视中日两国人民的反动的丑恶面目。电报引用毛主席的一段语录：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”电报指出，美日反动派破坏中日友好的阴谋，必将在日本人民斗争面前彻底破产。
    外交学会和政法学会的电报是发给日本社会党青少年局、日本社会主义青年同盟、日本北海道社会主义学习会、日本福井社会主义学习会、日本反对军事基地全国联络会议、日本中央劳农会议、日本全国“学习”之友会（劳动大学）、日本青年问题研究会、日本全国社团团体联络协议会、日本青年法学家协会和日本拥护宪法国民联合会等团体的。
