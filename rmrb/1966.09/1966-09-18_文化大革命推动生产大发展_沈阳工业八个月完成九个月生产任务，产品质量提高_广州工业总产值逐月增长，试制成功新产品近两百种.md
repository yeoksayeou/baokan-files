The great proletarian cultural revolution has promoted significant industrial development. In Shenyang, industrial production for eight months has completed nine months' worth of tasks, with product quality improving. In Guangzhou, the total industrial output value has increased month by month, with nearly 200 new products successfully developed.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 17th: The broad masses of workers on the industrial front in Shenyang have high spirits, firmly holding their posts, and are promoting a new situation of all-around leap in industrial production under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the new high tide of the great proletarian cultural revolution.

In the first eight months of this year, the city's workers have completed the production tasks equivalent to nine months of the year. Out of 90 major industrial products, 72 have seen significant increases in production compared to the same period last year. Product quality has been stable and improved. The 19 categories of mining equipment, forging and pressing equipment, electric motors, metal cutting machine tools, industrial water pumps, transformers, and other machine and electrical equipment urgently needed by the state, which have been supplied to the country, have all increased by more than 30 percent compared to the same period last year, with some increasing by more than one fold. Agricultural irrigation equipment supporting the country's agriculture completed the annual production plan as early as July. At the same time, a batch of new products have been successfully developed.

This old industrial base of Shenyang has achieved a significant increase in production this year under the condition of neither adding new equipment nor increasing the workforce. The broad masses of workers have said well: We rely on the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought! The broad masses of workers in the city, armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have fully displayed the daring to think and dare to do spirit of the proletarian revolution, relying on their own wisdom and ingenuity, and have implemented more than 27,000 technical innovation and technical revolution projects. They have also broken the foreign frameworks, using their own experimental research successes in new technologies and structures, designing hundreds of new products with modern levels or unique Chinese styles. The new type of industrial multi-stage pump designed and developed by the workers of Shenyang Water Pump Factory has a functional utilization rate of over 90 percent, which is 25 percent higher than the old product produced using a foreign design. Some products were developed under the condition of strict technological blockade by imperialism and modern revisionism, relying on the workers' spirit of daring to venture and innovate. The workers proudly said: We have the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, and we are not afraid of any difficulties.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 17th: The broad revolutionary masses of workers on the industrial front in Guangzhou have high spirits, taking the Sixteen Points as their guide to action, promoting revolution and production, and achieving double victories in the great proletarian cultural revolution and production construction.

Since July and August, the broad revolutionary masses of workers have not only won victories on the ideological front but also on the material front. Based on the increase in production, stable quality, and reduction in raw material consumption in the first half of the year, the total industrial output value in July was 4.9 percent higher than in June, and August was higher than July. During this period, nearly 200 new products have been successfully developed, some of which have caught up with or surpassed domestic and international advanced levels.

The broad revolutionary masses of workers armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought are the most intelligent and brave. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, they have broken the bourgeois technical "authorities," daring to be the vanguard in climbing the technological peak. Recently, Guangzhou Paper Mill accepted a task to produce whiteboard paper. This whiteboard paper is used to print the cover of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," with high-quality requirements. At that time, the bourgeois technical "authorities" in the factory emphasized that this and that were not possible and were unwilling to accept the task. The workers were very angry about the opinions of these bourgeois technical "authorities." Many workers said: "Producing paper for printing the cover of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is our glorious political task. No matter how big the difficulty, we must find a way out." The workers set aside the bourgeois technical "authorities" and took the initiative to experiment, breaking the foreign frameworks, and finally successfully produced this whiteboard paper.

The Shijiazhuang Tractor Parts Factory in Hebei Province has been put into production after completion. The more than 1,000 sets of equipment installed in this factory are all made in China.

    文化大革命推动生产大发展
    沈阳工业八个月完成九个月生产任务，产品质量提高
    广州工业总产值逐月增长，试制成功新产品近两百种
    据新华社沈阳十七日电　沈阳工业战线广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，斗志昂扬，坚守岗位，推动着全市工业生产出现了全面跃进的新局面。
    全市职工在今年前八个月，完成了相当于全年九个月的生产任务。九十种主要工业产品中，有七十二种的产量比去年同期有很大增长。产品质量稳定提高。已经向全国供应的采矿设备、锻压设备、电动机、金属切削机床、工业用水泵、变压器等十九类国家急需的机电设备，都比去年同期增长百分之三十以上，有的增长一倍多。支援全国农业的农田排灌设备，早在七月份就完成了全年生产计划。与此同时，还试制成功一批新产品。
    沈阳这个老工业基地，今年生产的大幅度提高，是在既没有增加新设备，又没有增加工人的条件下取得的。广大工人说得好：我们靠的是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想！全市广大职工用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，充分发挥了敢想、敢干的无产阶级革命精神，依靠自己的聪明才智，实现了两万七千多个技术革新、技术革命项目。他们还大破洋框框，用自己试验研究成功的新技术、新结构，设计出数以百计的具有现代水平或中国独特风格的新产品。沈阳水泵厂职工研究设计成的新型工业用多级泵，功能利用率达到百分之九十以上，比采用一种外国设计生产的老产品，一下子提高了百分之二十五。有些产品是在帝国主义和现代修正主义对我们进行严密技术封锁的情况下，靠职工们发扬敢闯、敢创的革命精神搞出来的。职工们豪迈地说：我们有伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想做指导，什么困难都不怕。
    据新华社广州十七日电　广州市工业战线广大革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以十六条为行动指南，抓革命，促生产，取得了文化大革命和生产建设双胜利。
    七月、八月以来，广大革命职工不仅在精神战线上打了胜仗，同时也在物质战线上打了胜仗。全市工业生产在上半年产量增加、质量稳定、原材料消耗降低的基础上，七月份工业总产值又比六月份提高百分之四点九，八月份比七月份又有所提高。这期间，还有近两百种新产品试制成功，其中有些产品赶上或超过了国内、国际先进水平。
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命职工最聪明、最勇敢。在文化大革命中，他们大破资产阶级技术“权威”，敢当攀登技术高峰的急先锋。不久前，广州人民造纸厂接受一项生产白板纸的任务。这种白板纸是用来印制《毛主席语录》封面的，质量要求较高。当时，厂里的资产阶级技术“权威”强调这也不行，那也不行，不愿意接受任务。工人们对这些资产阶级技术“权威”的意见非常气愤。许多工人说：“生产印制《毛主席语录》的纸，是我们光荣的政治任务，天大的困难也不怕，一定要闯出一条路来。”工人们把资产阶级技术“权威”撇在一边，自己动手试验，突破洋框框，终于成功地把这种白板纸生产出来了。（附图片）
