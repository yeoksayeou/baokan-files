Tibetan herdsmen are actively building grasslands and developing animal husbandry.

The Qamdo Prefecture's Bangoi County in Jure Township is a region severely affected by spring droughts. Since this year, herdsmen have seriously studied Chairman Mao's works such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and have decided to use the spirit of Yugong to quickly change the dry appearance of the grasslands. They have built a dam ten meters long and over three meters high on the local Sangqu River, and also constructed a nine-hundred-meter-long canal to irrigate the grasslands.

In the Lhoka Prefecture's Comai County, Zeku Township, animal husbandry production has developed rapidly in recent years, and the grasslands are insufficient. Cadres and the masses have raised their consciousness through studying Chairman Mao's works and have decided to divert water for irrigation and artificially plant grass to develop new grasslands. They have already built a dam and a canal over four thousand meters long, and have newly constructed large areas of grasslands that can be irrigated. They have also trial-planted over one hundred and sixty mu of oat grass and barley grass for fodder.

The herdsmen of Suge Township and Ganzha Township in Lhoka Prefecture's Langkazi County are actively building dams and canals to develop water conservancy. In a short period this year, the two townships have increased irrigable grasslands by a total of twenty-six thousand mu. Suge Township has also set aside two hundred mu of grassland for artificial fertilization and cultivation of mowing areas. Both townships have established areas for planting alfalfa, root vegetables, and other fodder crops.

    西藏牧民当活愚公
    兴修水利建设草原
    新华社拉萨七日电　西藏各地牧民积极建设草原，发展畜牧业。
    那曲专区班戈县丘热乡是一个春旱严重的地区。今年以来，牧民们认真学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》等文章，决心以愚公精神迅速改变草原的干旱面貌。他们在当地的桑曲河上修起了一座长十米、高三米多的拦河坝，还修了一条九百米长的渠道，灌溉草原。
    山南专区措美县哲古乡近年畜牧生产发展很快，草场不够用了。干部和群众在学习毛主席著作中提高了觉悟，决心引水灌溉，人工种草，发展新的草原。他们已修起一座拦河坝和一条四千多米的渠道，新建了大片能够灌溉的草场，还试种了一百六十多克地（每克约一市亩）的青稞草、燕麦草等饲草。
    山南专区浪卡子县苏格乡和甘扎乡的牧民，积极拦河修渠，发展水利。在今年一个不长的时期内，两乡新增能灌溉的草场共二万六千多克。苏格乡还专辟二百克草场作为人工施肥培育的割草地。两乡都建立了种植苜蓿、元根等饲料作物的场地。
