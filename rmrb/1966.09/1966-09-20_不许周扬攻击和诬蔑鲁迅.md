The surging waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a mighty torrent and thunderous storm, are sweeping across the country with unprecedented speed. Hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely fighting against all monsters and demons. In the literary and artistic circles, Zhou Yang, who waves the red flag to oppose the red flag, the ringleader of the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary and artistic black line, has finally been exposed by the revolutionary masses. This is a great victory for the Cultural Revolution, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

I

Zhou Yang and his gang's anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought literary and artistic black line is a combination of bourgeois literary thought, modern revisionist literary thought, and the so-called literary line of the 1930s. They have been vigorously promoting the so-called literary line of the 1930s, which is a crucial aspect of their conspiratorial activities.

To promote their so-called literary line of the 1930s, Zhou Yang and his gang have raised the black flag of bourgeois and revisionist literature of the 1930s. They cannot help but attack and slander Lu Xun to distort, reverse, and fabricate history. This is because they were negative figures in the 1930s. Negative figures want to pose as positive figures, and even as "consistently correct" positive figures. How can they get away with it without fundamentally distorting, reversing, and fabricating history?

They claim that their "1930s" literary line is "revolutionary" and "correct," which is a colossal lie. Throughout the 1930s, Zhou Yang and his gang followed an opportunist literary line, with left opportunism in the early period and right opportunism in the later period. At that time, as the flag bearer of the fighting left-wing literary movement, Lu Xun had deeply exposed and criticized the erroneous line of Zhou Yang and his gang.

As early as the founding conference of the Left-Wing Writers' League in 1930, Lu Xun issued a warning: "I think that in the present situation, a 'left-wing' writer can easily become a 'right-wing' writer." In 1932, Lu Xun, in an open letter to Zhou Yang titled "Insults and Threats Are Not Struggles," directly criticized the "Literary Monthly" edited by Zhou Yang. In 1934, Lu Xun pointed out in a letter that "the foundation of the Left League was not very good" and "it is not just that there are few people, but even this cannot be achieved."

Zhou Yang and his gang did not accept Lu Xun's criticism but instead launched a vicious attack on him. In 1936, they proposed the surrenderist slogan of "National Defense Literature" based on the right opportunist line of Wang Ming, opposing Lu Xun's revolutionary slogan of "Literature of National Revolutionary War for the Masses." Lu Xun saw that Zhou Yang and his gang had sided with the class enemy to shoot poisoned arrows at him, so he declared a complete break with them and refused to join their "Association of Writers."

I remember very clearly the despicable and shameful conspiracies of Zhou Yang and his gang against Lu Xun during his lifetime. During this period, Lu Xun, despite his illness, wrote many brilliant essays and letters to fight against the surrenderism of Zhou Yang and his gang until his heart stopped beating.

Lu Xun pointed out:

They used the names of "National Defense Literature" and "Association of Writers" to "frame people for crimes, play with authority," "deploy a large encirclement," and "take advantage of my difficulties to launch a massive attack."

They "speak grand words during the day and engage in divisive, provocative, and splitist activities at night."

They "use a big flag as a tiger skin to wrap themselves and scare others; when things are not to their liking, they use their authority (?) to accuse people of crimes, and the accusations are terribly severe," "acting arbitrarily and violently to the extreme."

Lu Xun emphasized that all these evil deeds were directed by Zhou Yang and his gang. "They have their own clique, colluding with each other, controlling the literary world, making it chaotic and smoky."

Lu Xun was deeply disgusted and hated these evil deeds of Zhou Yang and his gang. He said: "The enemy is not to be feared; the most frightening thing is the termites in our own camp, and many things are ruined by them."

The conspiracies of Zhou Yang and his gang within the revolutionary camp in the 1930s caused serious damage to the left-wing literary movement represented by Lu Xun, playing a role that the reactionary Kuomintang could not play.

The theory and practice of Zhou Yang's surrenderist literary line and its consequences infuriated Lu Xun. He once said: "If my illness improves slightly, I will still expose them."

This is Lu Xun's stance and attitude towards Zhou Yang's surrenderist literary line.

Regarding the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front in the 1930s, with Lu Xun on one side and Zhou Yang on the other, Chairman Mao had already made a historical summary in "On New Democracy." Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Lu Xun's direction is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation." This is a heavy blow to the bourgeois and revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang.

II

Zhou Yang and his gang knew that this part of their unsavory history was very unfavorable for their activities to restore capitalism, so they always wanted to falsify and reverse it. They waited for 21 years and finally found an opportunity in the anti-rightist struggle of 1957.

Zhou Yang and his gang, taking advantage of their leadership positions in the literary and artistic circles during the anti-rightist struggle, concealed their rightist political faces and used the pretext of criticizing the rightist element Feng Xuefeng to play a trick of reversing history.

From June to August 1957, the Chinese Writers' Association held 25 sessions of the Party Committee's expanded meeting to criticize the rightist elements Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and Feng Xuefeng. I was then notified to participate in these meetings. Now, I want to expose the conspiratorial activities of Zhou Yang and his gang at the meeting and make them public.

At the 17th session on August 14, Xia Yan made a long speech. Under the pretext of criticizing Feng Xuefeng, he first raised the issue of the historical struggle of the 1930s literary line and the controversy over the two slogans, firing the first shot at attacking Lu Xun.

It is now known that this meeting to attack Lu Xun was personally planned by Zhou Yang. On the afternoon of August 11, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and Shao Qian Lin first talked to Feng Xuefeng. Zhou Yang mentioned the historical issue of the 1930s literary struggle in the conversation, marking the beginning of his self-vindication.

The commander's order was given, and Xia Yan, Chen Yangmei, and Zhou Libo immediately responded, stirring up a black wind of attacking Lu Xun at the expanded meeting of the Writers' Association Party Committee. The center of their attack was Lu Xun's proletarian slogan of "Literature of National Revolutionary War for the Masses" and his revolutionary essay "In Reply to Xu Mo Yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front." It was precisely this slogan and this essay that raised the revolutionary banner of the fighting left-wing literary movement, hitting the vital point of Zhou Yang and his gang's surrenderist literary line, making them hate Lu Xun to the core.

Someone said that Xia Yan's speech on August 14 was an "explosive event." Indeed, it was a reactionary "explosive event" plotted and conspired by Zhou Yang and his gang. They wanted to blow up Lu Xun's revolutionary and fighting banner to pave the way for their conspiracy to restore capitalism. In his speech, Xia Yan pretended to be a "victim" and made a "complaint" against Lu Xun, saying that after Feng Xuefeng returned to Shanghai from Waqiao in 1936, he "first found Mr. Lu Xun" and "without listening to the opinions of Comrade Zhou Yang and other party members, instructed Hu Feng to propose the slogan of 'Literature of National Revolutionary War for the Masses,'" and "arbitrarily carried out the evil activities of splitting the left-wing cultural movement."

They spread rumors and attacked, looking very fierce!

The proletarian revolutionary slogan of "Literature of National Revolutionary War for the Masses" was proposed by Lu Xun based on the policy of the Anti-Japanese United Front of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. To say that this slogan was "instructed by Hu Feng" is purely malicious slander and a cunning diversion. I want to ask Zhou Yang and his gang: What right do you have to forbid Lu Xun from proposing this slogan? What right do you have to insist that Lu Xun "listen to your opinions"? When you proposed the surrenderist slogan of "National Defense Literature," did you listen to Lu Xun's opinions? You yourselves are not revolutionary, but you still put on the airs of "Mr. Zhao" and "fake foreign devils," forbidding others to be revolutionary?

Xia Yan slandered Lu Xun for "arbitrarily carrying out the evil activities of splitting the left-wing cultural movement"! What "left-wing" are you? Your implementation of the right opportunist line of Wang Ming has long become the right wing that surrenders to the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. The ones who "arbitrarily carried out the evil activities of splitting the left-wing cultural movement" are precisely you. The true flag bearer of the left-wing cultural movement is Lu Xun, who was attacked by you.

Xia Yan also spread a rumor that Lu Xun's essay "In Reply to Xu Mo Yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front" was written by Feng Xuefeng in Lu Xun's name, and then attacked the essay, saying that "the details and content of the description are all untrue."

This is too much! I couldn't help but say at the meeting, "You are putting all the untrue situations completely on Lu Xun's head!" I also explained: "This essay has been sent to the Lu Xun Museum. Comrades can find it and see it. There is Lu Xun's personal handwriting on the manuscript. Did Lu Xun disagree with how it was published? After it was published, did Lu Xun make a statement in the newspaper saying, 'This essay was written by Feng Xuefeng, not by me'?" However, in the later printed collection of speeches at the meeting, Zhou Yang and his gang, in order to deceive the party and the masses, included their slanderous speeches attacking Lu Xun, but did not include my speech on August 14 to refute the rumors!

Today, I want to refute the rumors again here.

At that time, although Lu Xun was seriously ill, he was very serious about the great debate with Zhou Yang and his gang and the publication of the essay "In Reply to Xu Mo Yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front." Not only did the entire essay's ideas belong to him, but the text was also carefully revised by him. Moreover, there were four whole pages of an article exposing the ugly faces of the surrenderists Zhou Yang and his gang, which were personally written by him, written while he was ill. Usually, he would write essays of more than ten thousand words (such as the postscript to "Preparations for the Spring Festival") in one go at night, but this time, because he was seriously ill, it took him three or four days to complete. Then, I transcribed it and sent it to be published in the "Writers' Monthly." As usual, before the essay was officially printed, he carefully read the proof and made corrections. Later, Lu Xun excitedly talked to others about the writing process of this essay. Lu Xun said: "He (referring to Xu Mo Yong) knew I was ill and took advantage of my inability to write, sending a letter to lecture me, trying to hit me when I couldn't fight back. So I had to reply to him, writing one or two thousand or two or three thousand words a day, writing for four days."

Xia Yan attacked this essay, saying that "the details and content of the description are all untrue," especially pointing out the section "Four Strong Men," because this section hit hard the "ancestors" of the 1930s literary black line, Zhou Yang, Tan Han, Xia Yan, and Yang Hanqing. And this section was precisely what Lu Xun saw with his own eyes and wrote with his own hand!

In his speech, Xia Yan also directly slandered Lu Xun for having "ideological resistance" to the party's policy of the Anti-Japanese United Front. This is a complete reversal of black and white, a counterattack, aiming to cover up their own surrenderism. I remember very clearly that in the summer of 1936, Lu Xun heard about Chairman Mao's proposal to establish the Anti-Japanese United Front and immediately accepted it wholeheartedly, completely accepting Chairman Mao's great instructions. He felt that China had such a great leader, and there was no insurmountable difficulty. It was under these circumstances that he proposed the correct slogan of "Literature of National Revolutionary War for the Masses," opposing Zhou Yang and his gang's surrenderist slogan of "National Defense Literature." Lu Xun insisted on the revolutionary line of the proletarian Anti-Japanese National United Front formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The ones who truly went against the party's policy of the Anti-Japanese United Front were Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and their representatives of the class surrenderist line.

After Xia Yan's speech, several consecutive meetings were held, and Zhou Yang and his gang successively spoke, unanimously and viciously attacking Lu Xun while enthusiastically praising Zhou Yang and his gang's 1930s literary black line. In their speeches, Zhou Yang was "the party." Whoever opposed Zhou Yang was against the party! Whoever "went against the literary line led by Comrade Zhou Yang" was "against the party's literary line"! They could ignore and oppose the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, but they treated the right opportunist proposals of Wang Ming and Zhou Yang as sacred edicts and gods.

At one meeting, they said: It is said that Comrade Zhou Yang, Comrade Qian Lin, and Comrade Mo Han are a line, and indeed they are a line. But this is the party's political line and organizational line embodied through Comrade Zhou Yang and others, a red line.

They admitted it themselves. They were indeed a line, but not a "red line," not the "party's political line and organizational line," but a black line, a line of Wang Ming's opportunist political line and organizational line, a line against the party and against Mao Zedong Thought!

This meeting continued until September 16, and Zhou Yang summed up this trick of reversing history at the end of the meeting. Zhou Yang said: "Feng Xuefeng's sectarian attack on the Shanghai underground party organization in 1936 caused the split of the revolutionary literary and artistic cause at that time, which was a serious act of violating party principles and harming revolutionary interests."

Zhou Yang here seemed to be criticizing the rightist element Feng Xuefeng, but in reality, he was criticizing Lu Xun. They were like actors on stage, putting on makeup and performing, fighting fiercely on stage, then retreating backstage, becoming one family, all revisionist elements, all opposing Chairman Mao's literary line.

This became even clearer after the meeting.

As soon as the meeting ended, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and Shao Qian Lin, together with the rightist element Feng Xuefeng who had just been "criticized" by them, conspired to write annotations for "In Reply to Xu Mo Yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front." This annotation that reversed history was drafted by Feng Xuefeng at the behest of Zhou Yang and his gang, and Feng Xuefeng's name was even printed on the letter sent by "People's Literature Publishing House" on October 19, 1957:

The annotated manuscripts of three volumes, "Random Thoughts from the Thatched Cottage," "More Random Thoughts from the Thatched Cottage," and "Final Random Thoughts from the Thatched Cottage," are sent to you for your review. In the "Final Random Thoughts from the Thatched Cottage," the annotated manuscript of "In Reply to Xu Mo Yong and on the Issue of the Anti-Japanese United Front" was written by Comrade Feng Xuefeng after this criticism of the Ding-Chen anti-party clique. Please provide your opinions after reviewing it so that it can be revised accordingly.

The truth is exposed! Zhou Yang and Feng Xuefeng are indeed birds of a feather. Zhou Yang criticized Feng Xuefeng to attack Lu Xun. So as soon as the criticism stopped, they joined hands to engage in the common cause of opposing Lu Xun.

The annotation that reversed history, drafted by Feng Xuefeng and carefully revised by Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and Shao Qian Lin, was finally sent to Feng Xuefeng for review. In Shao Qian Lin's letter to Wang Shizheng, it was written:

The annotation of the essay "In Reply to Xu Mo Yong" in the complete works of Lu Xun has been revised with Comrades Zhou Yang and Mo Han. The manuscript is with Comrade Mo Han. After you retrieve it, please make a copy for Feng Xuefeng to read.

Isn't it clear what kind of relationship Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and Shao Qian Lin have with Feng Xuefeng? Although they have various contradictions, in opposing Lu Xun and the proletarian revolutionary faction, they are completely in agreement!

To cover up their conspiracy to reverse history, in the ninth and tenth volumes of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun" published by the People's Literature Publishing House in October 1958, they removed all the important letters related to criticizing the slogan of "National Defense Literature" and exposing the ugly faces of Zhou Yang and his gang's surrenderism and sectarianism from the "Lu Xun's Letters" that I originally compiled. This was to destroy the evidence of their forgery of history, slander of Lu Xun, and praise of themselves.

It is now known that this matter was handled by the second-in-command of Zhou Yang and his gang, Lin Mo Han. Lin Mo Han, through Wang Renzhou (also known as Ba Ren) who was working at the People's Literature Publishing House at that time, conveyed to Wang Shizheng:

Regarding the issue of the two slogans, the situation in the Shanghai literary circles at that time was very complicated. Some people used the controversy over the two slogans to attack Comrade Zhou Yang, so all letters related to the issue of the two slogans should not be included.

This is a private conversation, of course, it cannot be exposed to the sun. So on the surface, they put up a sign saying "general correspondence will not be compiled."

III

Zhou Yang and his gang have many evil activities of attacking and slandering Lu Xun. Here is another prominent example: Zhou Yang and his gang controlled the creation of the film script "Biography of Lu Xun."

In March 1961, Zhou Yang, in a conversation with the creators of "Biography of Lu Xun," tried hard to play a trick of politically belittling Lu Xun and elevating himself.

Zhou Yang said that "Lu Xun was not a political activist," "he did not enter the vortex of political struggle," and "it is better to focus on writing his activities as a writer, with revolutionary activities as his internal and spiritual response. If his connection with revolutionary activities is written too directly, first, it goes against history, and second, Lu Xun will be passive and difficult."

Who is "against history"? The one who is against history is not someone else, but Zhou Yang himself!

Lu Xun's life was a revolutionary and fighting life. He experienced two historical stages: the old democratic revolution and the new democratic revolution. In each stage, he followed the progress of the times and always stood at the forefront of political struggle. Zhou Yang and his gang wanted to erase this, but they absolutely could not!

Chairman Mao said in "On New Democracy":

Lu Xun is the commander-in-chief of the Chinese cultural revolution. He is not only a great writer but also a great thinker and a great revolutionary.

What "Lu Xun was not a political activist" and "he did not enter the vortex of political struggle," Zhou Yang and his gang's slander, is this not a direct opposition to Chairman Mao's evaluation of Lu Xun? Lu Xun was indeed not a political activist like Zhou Yang, a bourgeois "political activist," and he did not enter their vortex of surrenderist "struggle"! Lu Xun was a great proletarian political activist, a warrior who stood at the forefront of the revolution and charged into the enemy's ranks. As Chairman Mao said:

Lu Xun is the most correct, bravest, most resolute, most loyal, most enthusiastic, and unprecedented national hero who represents the majority of the nation on the cultural front, charging into the enemy's ranks.

Zhou Yang and his gang opposed writing about the proletarian politician Lu Xun, precisely to cover up their own faces of bourgeois politicians who surrendered and compromised. They denied Lu Xun's political position in the history of the Chinese revolution, precisely to elevate themselves, dressing up as 100% "Marxists," as if they had the qualifications to teach Lu Xun. During Lu Xun's lifetime, they tried to teach Lu Xun but were severely beaten by Lu Xun; after Lu Xun's death, they still wanted to use the opportunity of filming "Biography of Lu Xun" to defame Lu Xun. Zhou Yang and his gang's hearts are so vicious!

Zhou Yang and his gang also strongly opposed writing about Lu Xun's relationship with the party and the great influence of Chairman Mao on Lu Xun. Lu Xun had a very close relationship with the party. In Beijing, he had close contact with Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party; in Guangzhou, he had secretly met the person in charge of the party in Guangdong at that time.

It is particularly worth mentioning that although Lu Xun did not have the opportunity to meet our great leader Chairman Mao during his lifetime, he enthusiastically supported and sincerely accepted Chairman Mao's wise leadership.

After hearing about Chairman Mao's policy on the Anti-Japanese United Front, Lu Xun said that this policy, "I have seen it, I support it, I unconditionally join this front." At the same time, he clearly expressed his firm opposition to Zhou Yang and his gang's surrenderist line.

In the summer of 1936, Lu Xun suddenly received a letter that shamelessly attacked the party's Anti-Japanese policy and maliciously sowed discord between Lu Xun and the party. Lu Xun saw from this letter that it was the speech and proposition of the Trotskyites. In his diary on July 7, he clearly wrote: "Received a letter from Chen Zhongshan, also Trotskyites." In "In Reply to the Trotskyites," Lu Xun thoroughly refuted the counter-revolutionary fallacies of the Trotskyites. In the letter, with unlimited respect and revolutionary feelings, he mentioned the great leader Chairman Mao. Lu Xun said: "Those who are steadfastly and firmly fighting on the ground for the survival of the Chinese people today, I regard them as comrades, and I am proud of it."

Under the inspiration of the great revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people led by Chairman Mao, Lu Xun firmly fought against the counter-revolutionary "encirclement" of culture and fought against the surrenderists who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. Chairman Mao said: "The communist Lu Xun, however, became a great man of the Chinese cultural revolution in this 'encirclement.'" Regarding Lu Xun's spirit of "frowning at a thousand pointing fingers, bowing his head to be an ox for the children," Chairman Mao gave a high evaluation. Chairman Mao said:

All communists, all revolutionaries, all revolutionary literary and artistic workers should learn from Lu Xun's example, be the "ox" of the proletariat and the people, work to the end, and die only then.

Zhou Yang forbade writing about Lu Xun's relationship with the party and the influence of Chairman Mao on Lu Xun. He said that if the party was written, Lu Xun's "own groping and struggle would be weakened"! They distorted the image of a great communist Lu Xun into a bourgeois intellectual who groped and struggled individually, detached from the party's leadership and the masses. This was their evil intention! Zhou Yang even crazily shouted: "Don't be afraid to write like this, someone might raise objections: The influence of the party is not enough, Chairman Mao is not mentioned, etc." This completely exposed his anti-party and anti-Chairman Mao political face.

IV

Zhou Yang and his gang forged the history of the struggle between the two lines on the literary and artistic front in the 1930s, not only to overthrow Lu Xun but more importantly to oppose the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to praise the opportunist line of Wang Ming, and to prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

On May 8, 1958, Lin Mo Han wrote a letter to Wang Renzhou and others. The letter is quoted below:

I will go to another place tomorrow for a period. There are a few things to tell you:

First, regarding the publication of the collected works or selected works of writers since the May Fourth Movement, Comrade Zhou Yang's opinion is that there should be an overall plan, which ones to publish, which ones not to publish or to delay, let's discuss it. The collected works of Yu Dafu can be delayed, and the selected works can be published first.

Second, we have entrusted the Institute of Literature to be responsible for compiling a series of world literary classics and a series of literary theory books, which will be published by the Literature Publishing House. How to proceed with this work and how to cooperate between the publishing house and the institute need to be discussed. Comrade Zhou Yang is preparing to convene relevant comrades to discuss the above matters. Please remind Comrade Zhou Yang so that he won't forget.

Third, regarding the materials of literary controversies, the drafting needs to be hurried up.

From this letter and subsequent facts, it can be seen that after attacking and slandering Lu Xun and distorting and fabricating history, Zhou Yang and his gang were engaged in what kind of activities during the high tide of the Great Leap Forward across the country!

The first point is to publish a large number of works by the "ancestors" of the opportunist literary line of the 1930s. Under the command of Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han, what collections of Tan Han, Xia Yan, Yang Hanqing, and others, what "National Defense Drama," "National Defense Film," "National Defense Poetry," flooded the market. Moreover, through "Preface," "Postscript," "Editor's Note," and so on, they enthusiastically praised the bourgeois literary works of the 1930s as having "universal significance and typicality today"! They praised the bourgeois writers of the 1930s as "outstanding writers," "prophets of the times," "appearing on the literary scene like comets," "sharing breath and fate with the laboring people," and "making immortal contributions"! Zhou Yang and his gang were so enthusiastic about praising the "1930s," intending to use the bourgeois literary line of the 1930s to oppose the proletarian literary line formulated by Chairman Mao.

The second point is to publish a large number of Western bourgeois and revisionist works, using the spread of bourgeois literary theory to oppose Mao Zedong's literary thought. In literary criticism and university liberal arts education, what Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, and even Plato, Aristotle, etc., were regarded as the "highest authority"! Zhou Yang and his gang deliberately wanted to shape the younger generation into their own image, becoming the successors of the bourgeoisie.

The third point is to publish "Materials of Literary Controversies" through publishing, attempting to further reverse the history of the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front in the 1930s, attack Lu Xun, and overthrow Chairman Mao's historical summary of the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front.

What a vicious program for the restoration of capitalism! Zhou Yang and his gang's minds, where is there even a trace of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving socialism? It seems that they were really intoxicated at that time, thinking that they could "hurry up" and do whatever they wanted. However, extremes beget reversals. It was precisely from this that they "hurried up" to completely expose their revisionist faces.

As far as I know, after this, they also engaged in many evil activities of praising the opportunist line of Wang Ming, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and restoring capitalism. For example:

On March 2, 1960, the editorial departments of "Literary Criticism" and "Literary Gazette," under the orders of Zhou Yang, jointly held a symposium to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Left League. "Literary Gazette" published a report and article. The report even said: "The Left League, from the preparation in the autumn of 1929 to its establishment in March 1930, and then to its voluntary dissolution in early 1936, and the establishment of the anti-Japanese national united front organization in the literary and artistic circles, has always been active under the strong leadership of the party." "It raised high the banner of proletarian revolutionary literature," "seized the leadership of culture and art in the hands of the left wing under the party's leadership." They simply praised the opportunist line of Wang Ming and Zhou Yang to the sky!

Zhou Yang, this old hand at falsifying history, as early as March 14, 1956 (immediately after the 20th Congress of the CPSU), had already boasted: "Many of our comrades regard the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art as the beginning of the new literary movement, which is wrong. Particularly wrong is that some people think that only those from the old base areas are representative of orthodoxy. In fact, where did the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art come from?" By July 1961, he said: "No great writers emerged in the old democratic period, many great writers emerged in the new democratic revolutionary period, and no great writers emerged after the 'Speech'."

Zhou Yang openly attacked Chairman Mao, aiming to establish his own group of "great writers," "great theorists" as "orthodoxy" and realize their conspiracy to restore capitalism.

During the same period, Zhou Yang and his gang also systematically used filmmaking to promote the literary black line of the 1930s. For example, in 1959, they made "The Lin Family Shop," and in 1963 and 1964, they successively made "Early Spring in February" and "Stage Sisters" to promote the "1930s." This was an important part of their anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities.

Zhou Yang and his gang also engaged in the evil activities of rewriting literary history, compiling film history, etc., to completely falsify the history of the 1930s, to build monuments for themselves, and to create "bases" for promoting their bourgeois and revisionist literary line of the 1930s. This aspect has already been exposed by other comrades' articles.

In the 1930s, the struggle between Lu Xun and Zhou Yang and his gang was a struggle between the proletarian literary line and the bourgeois literary line. This struggle had been scientifically summarized by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's thorough criticism of the bourgeois literary line of the 1930s represented by Zhou Yang, starting from the Sixth Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee, has been 28 years, and starting from the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," it has been 24 years. These criticisms, Zhou Yang and his gang had personally heard. They pretended to accept them on the surface but actually always rejected Chairman Mao's criticisms, always rejected the transformation of their bourgeois worldview, and always rejected the implementation of Chairman Mao's literary line, stubbornly insisting on their bourgeois and revisionist literary line. They harbored resentment against Chairman Mao's criticisms and, given the opportunity, launched a crazy counterattack.

Zhou Yang and his gang, using their usurped leadership positions in the literary and artistic circles, have always engaged in anti-party and anti-Mao Zedong Thought evil activities. Chairman Mao proposed to sing less "foreign eight-legged essays," but they sang more. Chairman Mao proposed the direction of "literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers," but they opposed literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and promoted "popular literature and art." Chairman Mao pointed out that Lu Xun was the "greatest and bravest flag bearer of the new army of culture," but they attacked Lu Xun as "sectarianism." They attacked Lu Xun to attack Mao Zedong Thought, venting their hatred for Chairman Mao!

The anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought Zhou Yang and his gang have used all kinds of two-faced tactics in front of the party and the people, appearing human on the surface but devilish in secret, paying lip service but acting against, with two faces and three knives. They are a bunch of genuine anti-party and anti-people conspirators.

The great proletarian cultural revolution has completely exposed Zhou Yang and his gang of revisionists in broad daylight. From the 1930s to the 1960s, they have been recruiting and expanding their forces in the literary and artistic circles, singing against the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and fiercely opposing our wise Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Now, their anti-party and anti-people conspiracies have been completely smashed. We should shout in unison:

Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!

Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!

    不许周扬攻击和诬蔑鲁迅
    许广平
    无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮，正以排山倒海、雷霆万钧之势，汹涌澎湃，迅猛异常地在全国范围内展开。亿万工农兵群众，革命知识分子和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向一切妖魔鬼怪进行坚决的斗争。在文艺界，周扬这个打着红旗反红旗的大阴谋家，反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线的总头目，终于被革命群众揪出来了。这是文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    一
    周扬等人反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的文艺黑线，是资产阶级文艺思想、现代修正主义文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺的结合。大肆宣扬所谓三十年代的文艺路线，是周扬一伙人阴谋活动的一个极其重要的方面。
    周扬等人为了宣扬他们的所谓三十年代文艺路线，竖起三十年代资产阶级、修正主义文艺的黑旗，就不能不通过攻击和诬蔑鲁迅，来歪曲历史，颠倒历史，捏造历史。
    这是因为，他们本来是三十年代的反面人物。反面人物硬要装成正面人物，而且装成是“一贯正确”的正面人物，不从根本上来歪曲、颠倒和捏造历史，怎么混得下去呢？
    他们宣扬自己的“三十年代”文艺路线如何“革命”，如何“正确”，这是一个弥天大谎。
    在整个三十年代，周扬们实行的是一条机会主义的文艺路线，在前期是“左”倾机会主义，在后期是右倾机会主义。当时，作为战斗的左翼文艺运动旗手的鲁迅，曾经对周扬们的错误路线，进行了深刻的揭露和批判。
    早在一九三○年左翼作家联盟成立大会的讲话中，鲁迅就发出这样的警告：“我以为在现在，‘左翼’作家是很容易成为‘右翼’作家的。”①一九三二年，鲁迅在致周扬的一封公开信《辱骂和恐吓决不是战斗》中，直接对周扬主编的《文学月报》提出了尖锐的批评。一九三四年，鲁迅在一封通信中指出，“左联开始的基础就不大好”，“人少倒不要紧，只要质地好，而现在连这也做不到。”②
    周扬们没有接受鲁迅的批评，反而对鲁迅发动了恶毒的围攻。一九三六年，他们根据王明右倾机会主义路线提出了所谓“国防文学”的投降主义口号，反对鲁迅提出的“民族革命战争的大众文学”的革命口号。鲁迅看到周扬们竟然站到阶级敌人一边向他发射毒箭，就宣告同他们彻底决裂，拒绝加入他们的“文艺家协会”。
    我记得很清楚，周扬们在鲁迅生前的卑劣可耻的阴谋活动，鲁迅是亲身领略过的。这个时期，鲁迅抱病写了许多光辉的杂文和书信，向周扬们的投降主义进行斗争，一直到他的心脏停止跳动。
    鲁迅指出：
    他们利用“国防文学”和“文艺家协会”等等名义，“锻炼人罪，戏弄威权”，“大布围剿阵”，“乘我危难，大肆攻击”。
    他们“白天里讲些冠冕堂皇的话，暗夜里进行一些离间，挑拨，分裂的勾当”③。
    他们“拉大旗作为虎皮，包着自己，去吓呼别人；小不如意，就倚势（！）定人罪名，而且重得可怕”，“横暴恣肆，达于极点”④。
    鲁迅着重指出，凡此种种，根子是在周扬们的“指导”，“他们自有一伙，狼狈为奸，把持着文学界，弄得乌烟瘴气。”⑤
    对于周扬们的这些险恶行径，鲁迅是深恶痛绝的。他说：“敌人是不足惧的，最可怕的是自己营垒里的蛀虫，许多事都败在他们手里。”⑥
    周扬们混在革命阵营内部进行的这些阴谋活动，在三十年代，给以鲁迅为代表的左翼文艺运动，造成了严重的损害，起到了国民党反动派所不能起的作用。
    周扬投降主义文艺路线的“理论”和实践，及其所造成的恶果，引起了鲁迅的极大愤慨。他曾说：“我病倘稍愈，还要给以暴露的”⑦。
    这就是鲁迅对于周扬投降主义文艺路线的立场和态度。
    对于三十年代文化战线上以鲁迅为一方和以周扬为另一方的两条路线的斗争，毛主席在《新民主主义论》中已经作出了历史的总结。毛主席明确指出：“鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。”这是对以周扬为首的资产阶级、修正主义文艺路线的最沉重的打击。
    二
    周扬们知道，他们这一段见不得人的历史，对于他们进行资本主义复辟活动，是很不利的，因而总是想篡改，想翻案。他们等了二十一年，终于在一九五七年反右派斗争中，找到了机会。
    周扬等人在反右派斗争中，利用他们在文艺界窃踞的领导地位，掩盖了自己的右派政治面目，打着反对右派分子冯雪峰的幌子，玩弄了一个颠倒历史的大阴谋。
    一九五七年六月至八月间，中国作家协会开了二十五次党组扩大会议，批判丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰等右派分子。我当时曾被通知参加了这些会议。现在，我要把周扬一伙在会上的阴谋活动揭露出来，公之于众。
    在八月十四日的第十七次会议上，夏衍作了一个长篇发言。他以批判冯雪峰为名，首先提出了三十年代的文艺斗争历史和两个口号的论争问题，打响了攻击鲁迅的第一枪。
    现在了解到，这次攻击鲁迅的会议是周扬亲自策划的。八月十一日下午四时，周扬、林默涵、邵荃麟等先找了冯雪峰谈话。周扬在谈话中就提出了三十年代文艺斗争的历史问题，这是周扬为自己翻案的开始。
    主帅的号令一下，夏衍、陈荒煤、周立波等一伙立即群起响应，在作家协会党组扩大会上掀起了攻击鲁迅的一股黑风。他们攻击的中心，是鲁迅提出的
  “民族革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级的口号，和《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》这篇革命的论文。因为正是鲁迅的这个口号和这篇论文，高举起战斗的左翼文艺运动的革命旗帜，打中了周扬们的投降主义文艺路线的要害，使他们对鲁迅恨之入骨。
    有人说，夏衍八月十四日的发言是一个“爆炸事件”。一点不错。这是周扬一伙密谋策划的一个反动的
  “爆炸事件”。他们想炸掉鲁迅这面革命的、战斗的旗帜，为实现他们复辟资本主义的阴谋开辟道路。夏衍在发言中装出一副“受害者”的姿态，对鲁迅进行“控诉”。说什么一九三六年冯雪峰从瓦窑堡到上海后，“先找了鲁迅先生”，“不听一听周扬同志和其他党员同志的意见，就授意胡风提出了‘民族革命战争的大众文学’这个口号”，“恣肆地进行了分裂左翼文化运动的罪恶活动”。
    又是造谣，又是攻击，好一副气势汹汹的样子！
      “民族革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级的革命口号，是鲁迅根据党中央和毛主席的抗日统一战线政策提出的。把这个口号说成是冯雪峰“授意胡风提出”的，这纯粹是恶意的造谣，是为了打倒鲁迅而采用的阴险的障眼法。我要问一问周扬们：你们有什么权利不准鲁迅提出这个口号，有什么权利一定要鲁迅
  “听一听”你们的“意见”？你们自己在提出“国防文学”这个投降主义口号的时候，听过鲁迅的意见吗？你们自己不革命，还要摆出一副“赵太爷”和“假洋鬼子”的架势，不准别人革命吗？
    夏衍指桑骂槐地辱骂鲁迅“恣肆地进行了分裂左翼文化运动的罪恶活动”！你们是什么“左翼”？你们实行王明右倾机会主义路线的那一套，早已成为投降大地主大资产阶级的右翼。“恣肆地进行了分裂左翼文化运动的罪恶活动”的，正是你们。真正高举左翼文化运动大旗的伟大旗手，正是被你们攻击的鲁迅。
    夏衍还造了一个谣言，说鲁迅的《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》一文，是冯雪峰用鲁迅的名义写的，接着攻击这篇文章“不论描写的细节和内容，都是不真实的”。
    这真是欺人太甚了！我忍不住，当时在会上就说，你们“把一切不符合事实的情况，完全压到鲁迅头上”！我还说明：“这篇文章我已送到鲁迅博物馆，同志们可以找来看看，在原稿上有鲁迅的亲笔，鲁迅不同意怎么发表了？发表以后鲁迅有没有登报声明说‘这篇文章是冯雪峰写的，不是我写的’？”可是，在后来印发的会议发言集中，周扬们为了欺骗党、欺骗群众，把他们造谣攻击鲁迅的发言都收了进去，而我在八月十四日作的辟谣的发言却不给收进去！
    今天我要在这里再辟一次谣。
    鲁迅当时虽然是在大病之后，但对于同周扬们的这一场大是大非的争论，对于《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》一文的发表，是十分认真的。不但整篇文章的思想是属于他的，文字又经他仔细修改，而且有整整四页揭露投降主义者周扬等人嘴脸的文章，是他亲自执笔，扶病写成的。他平常写一万多字的文章（如《准风月谈》后记等），都是深夜执笔一气呵成的，这次却因为大病之后，花了三四天的时间才搞完。随后由我抄录寄出，交《作家》月刊发表。和平常一样，在文章正式付印以前，他又仔细看了一遍清样，并且作了改正。后来鲁迅还向别人兴奋地谈起这篇文章的写作过程。鲁迅说：“他（注：指徐懋庸）明知我病倒了，欺我不能动笔，写信来教训我一顿，想打我一个不能回手。所以我偏要答复他，每天写一二千或二三千字，共写了四天。”⑧
    夏衍攻击这篇文章“不论描写的细节和内容，都是不真实的”，特别指明“四条汉子”一节，因为这一节打痛了周扬、田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙这四个三十年代文艺黑线的“祖师爷”。而这一节，正是鲁迅亲眼所见，亲笔所写的！
    夏衍在发言中，还直接诬蔑鲁迅对党的抗日统一战线政策有“思想抵触”。这完全是颠倒黑白、倒打一耙，目的是掩盖他们自己的投降主义。我记得很清楚，一九三六年夏季，鲁迅听到了毛主席关于建立抗日统一战线的主张，立即倾心悦服，完全接受了毛主席的伟大指示。他感到，中国有了这样一个伟大的领袖，就没有不可克服的困难。正是在这种情况下，他提出了“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个正确的口号，同周扬们的投降主义的“国防文学”口号相对立。鲁迅所坚持的，是党中央和毛主席制定的无产阶级的抗日民族统一战线的革命路线。真正违背党的抗日统一战线政策的，正是周扬、夏衍等人为代表的阶级投降路线。
    夏衍发言以后，一连几次会议，周扬的一伙相继发言，一致恶毒地攻击鲁迅，同时极力吹捧周扬为首的三十年代文艺黑线。在他们的发言中，周扬就是“党”。谁反对周扬，谁就是反党！谁“和周扬同志领导的文艺路线相违背”，谁就是“反对党的文艺路线”！党中央和毛主席的指示，他们可以不听，可以反对，王明和周扬的右倾机会主义主张，他们却奉若圣旨，敬若神明。
    在一次会议上，他们说：据说，周扬同志、荃麟同志、默涵同志等是一条线，确是一条线。但是这是通过周扬同志等体现出来的党的政治路线和组织路线，是一条红线。
    不打自招。他们确是一条线，但不是“红线”，不是“党的政治路线和组织路线”，而是黑线，是王明的机会主义政治路线和组织路线，是一条反党反毛泽东思想的黑线！
    这个会一直开到九月十六日，周扬在会议结束时，对这个颠倒历史的大阴谋，作了总结。周扬说：“冯雪峰在一九三六年对上海地下党组织的宗派打击，造成了当时革命文艺事业的分裂，是严重破坏党的原则和损害革命利益的行为。”
    周扬在这里表面上是骂右派分子冯雪峰，实际上是骂鲁迅。他们好像戏台上化妆上演的红脸杀白脸一样，在台上热闹打杀一阵之后，退到后台，都成了一家人，都是资产阶级修正主义分子，都是反对毛主席的文艺路线的。
    这一点在会后就更加看得清楚了。
    会议一结束，周扬、林默涵、邵荃麟就伙同刚刚受过他们“批判”的右派分子冯雪峰，一起阴谋制作《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》的注释。这条颠倒历史的注释是由周扬一伙委托右派分子冯雪峰起草的，而且公然把冯雪峰的名字打印在一九五七年十月十九日以“人民文学出版社”名义发出的信上：
    送上鲁迅著作《且介亭杂文》、《且介亭杂文二集》、《且介亭杂文末编》等三本注释稿，请您予以审阅。在《且介亭杂文末编》中，《答徐懋庸并关于抗日统一战线问题》的注释稿，则是由冯雪峰同志在此次批判丁、陈反党集团之后所写的。在您审阅之后请把意见提出，以便遵照修改。
    真相大白！周扬和冯雪峰，本来就是一丘之貉，周扬骂冯雪峰，目的是打鲁迅。所以骂声未绝，马上就携起手来从事反对鲁迅的共同事业了。
    冯雪峰起草，经过周扬、林默涵、邵荃麟三人精心修改定稿的颠倒历史的注释，最后还要送给冯雪峰看。在邵荃麟给王士菁的一封信里写道：
    鲁迅全集中关于答徐懋庸一文的注释，已和周扬、默涵同志共同修改了。稿子在默涵同志处，你取回后可抄份给雪峰一阅。
    周扬、林默涵、邵荃麟之流和冯雪峰之流究竟是什么关系，不是很清楚了吗？他们之间尽管有种种矛盾，但在反对鲁迅、反对无产阶级革命派这一点上，是完全一致的！
    周扬们为了掩盖颠倒历史的阴谋，在一九五八年十月由人民文学出版社出版的《鲁迅全集》第九、十卷中所选辑的书信，竟将原来我所编的《鲁迅书简》中收进的有关批评“国防文学”口号和揭露周扬一伙投降主义和宗派主义丑恶嘴脸的重要书信，全部抽掉。这是为他们伪造历史、诬蔑鲁迅、吹捧自己的罪行消灭证据。
    现在知道，这件事，是周扬一伙的第二号人物林默涵出面干的。林默涵通过当时在人民文学出版社工作的王任叔（即巴人）向王士菁传达：
    关于两个口号的问题，当时上海文艺界的情况很复杂，有些人是借用这两个口号的争论攻击周扬同志的，因此，书信中凡是有关两个口号的问题，都不要收入。
    这是私房话，当然见不得太阳。所以在表面上打起了一个所谓“一般来往信件都不编入”的骗人招牌。
    三
    周扬们攻击和诬蔑鲁迅的罪恶活动很多，这里再举一个突出的事例，就是周扬等人控制电影剧本《鲁迅传》的创作。
    一九六一年三月，周扬在对《鲁迅传》创作人员的谈话中，竭力玩弄从政治上贬低鲁迅、抬高自己的阴谋。
    周扬说什么“鲁迅究竟不是政治活动家”，“他没有投入政治斗争漩涡的中心”，“还是着重写他作家的活动，革命活动作为他内在的、精神上的呼应。把他和革命活动的联系写得太直接了，第一违背历史，第二鲁迅就被动了，难了。”
    究竟是谁“违背历史”呢？违背历史的，不是别人，恰恰是周扬自己！
    鲁迅的一生，是革命的、战斗的一生。他的一生，经历了旧民主主义革命和新民主主义革命两个历史阶段。而在每一个阶段，他都跟着时代前进，始终站在政治斗争的前列。周扬们想要抹煞，是绝对办不到的！
    毛主席在《新民主主义论》中说：
    鲁迅是中国文化革命的主将，他不但是伟大的文学家，而且是伟大的思想家和伟大的革命家。⑨
    什么“鲁迅究竟不是政治活动家”，什么“他没有投入政治斗争漩涡的中心”，周扬们的诬蔑，难道不是直接反对毛主席对鲁迅的评价吗？鲁迅确实不是周扬这一号资产阶级的“政治活动家”，确实没有投入他们的投降主义的“漩涡的中心”！鲁迅是一个伟大的无产阶级政治活动家，他是站在革命最前列的冲锋陷阵的战士。正如毛主席所说的：
    鲁迅是在文化战线上，代表全民族的大多数，向着敌人冲锋陷阵的最正确、最勇敢、最坚决、最忠实、最热忱的空前的民族英雄。⑩
    周扬们反对写无产阶级政治家的鲁迅，正是为了掩盖他们自己投降妥协的资产阶级政治家的面孔。他们否认鲁迅在中国革命史上的政治地位，就是为了把他们自己抬起来，装扮成百分之百的“马克思主义者”，似乎他们是有资格教训鲁迅的。在鲁迅生前，他们企图教训鲁迅，受到了鲁迅的痛击；鲁迅死后，他们还要借拍摄《鲁迅传》的机会来诋毁鲁迅。周扬们的心是何等狠毒！
    周扬们还竭力反对写鲁迅和党的关系，反对写毛主席对鲁迅的巨大影响。鲁迅和党的关系是非常亲密的。在北京时期，他就和中国共产党的创始人之一李大钊同志有着亲密的交往；在广州时期，他曾秘密会见过当时党在广东方面的负责人。
    值得特别提出的是，鲁迅生前虽然没有能够见到我们伟大的领袖毛主席，但是他对毛主席的英明领导，是热情拥护，心悦诚服的。
    在听到毛主席关于抗日统一战线的政策之后，鲁迅说，这个政策，“我是看见的，我是拥护的，我无条件地加入这战线”?。同时他又明确表示，对周扬们那一套投降路线坚决反对。
    一九三六年夏，鲁迅忽然接到一封来信，信中肆无忌惮地攻击党的抗日政策，恶意挑拨鲁迅与党的关系。鲁迅从这封信里，已经清楚地看出那是托派的言论和主张。在七月七日的日记中，明白地写道：“得陈仲山信，托罗茨基派也”。鲁迅在《答托洛斯基派的信》中，彻底驳斥了托派的反革命谬论。信中以无限崇敬和热爱的革命感情，提到伟大的领袖毛主席。鲁迅说道：“那切切实实，足踏在地上，为着现在中国人的生存而流血奋斗者，我得引为同志，是自以为光荣的。”?
    鲁迅在毛主席领导下的中国人民伟大革命斗争的鼓舞下，坚决与反革命的文化“围剿”作斗争，与混入革命阵营里的投降主义者作斗争。毛主席说：“共产主义者的鲁迅，却正在这一‘围剿’中成了中国文化革命的伟人。”?对于鲁迅在斗争中表现的“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”的精神，毛主席给予了高度的评价。毛主席说：
    一切共产党员，一切革命家，一切革命的文艺工作者，都应该学鲁迅的榜样，做无产阶级和人民大众的“牛”，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。?
    周扬不许写鲁迅和党的关系，不许写毛主席对鲁迅的影响。胡说什么写了党，鲁迅“自己在摸索、奋斗就反而削弱了”！把一个伟大的共产主义者鲁迅的形象，歪曲成为脱离党的领导、脱离群众的个人摸索、个人奋斗的资产阶级文人，这就是周扬们的罪恶企图！周扬甚至疯狂地叫嚷：“不要怕这样写了有人会提意见：党的影响不够呀，毛主席都没有提到呀，等等。”这完全暴露了他的反党反毛主席的政治面目。
    四
    周扬一伙伪造三十年代文艺战线上两条路线斗争的历史，其目的当然不仅仅是为了打倒鲁迅，更重要的是为了反对伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，吹捧王明的机会主义路线，为实现资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    一九五八年五月八日，林默涵给王任叔等人一封信。照录于下：
    我明天要到外地去一个时期。有几件事奉告：
    一、关于五四以来作家的文集或选集的出版，周扬同志意见，应该有一个通盘的计划，那些该出，那些不出或缓出，大家讨论一下。郁达夫文集可稍缓出，先出选集就行了。
    二、我们已责成文学研究所负责选编一套世界文学名著丛书和文艺理论丛书，这两套丛书，都交文学出版社出版，这个工作如何进行，出版社与研究所如何协作，需要讨论一下。周扬同志准备召集有关同志就上述几事商谈一次，请你们催一下周扬同志，以免他忘记。
      三、关于文学论争资料，还需要加紧催稿。
    从这封信和此后的事实可以看出，周扬们在攻击和诬蔑鲁迅，歪曲和捏造历史之后，在全国大跃进的高潮中，究竟在干些什么勾当！
    第一条，就是大量出版三十年代机会主义文艺路线“祖师爷”们的作品。在周扬、林默涵的指挥下，什么田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙们的集子，什么“国防戏剧”、“国防电影”、“国防诗歌”，充斥市场。而且通过《序言》、《后记》、《编者说明》等等，大肆吹捧三十年代的资产阶级文艺作品“在今天也有普遍性和典型意义”！吹捧三十年代的资产阶级文人是“杰出的作家”、“时代的预言者”、“彗星似地出现在当时文坛”、“和劳动人民共呼吸共命运”、“作出了不朽的贡献”！周扬们如此狂热地吹捧“三十年代”，是企图用三十年代资产阶级文艺路线来对抗毛主席制定的无产阶级文艺路线。
    第二条，就是大量出版西方资产阶级、修正主义的东西，用传播资产阶级的文艺理论来同毛泽东文艺思想相对抗。在文艺评论和大学文科教学中，什么别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫以至柏拉图、亚里士多德等等，被当作了“最高权威”！周扬们蓄意要把青年一代塑造成他们自己的样子，成为资产阶级的接班人。
    第三条，就是通过出版“文学论争资料”，妄图进一步颠倒三十年代文化战线上两条路线斗争的历史，攻击鲁迅，推翻毛主席对文化战线上两条路线斗争的历史总结。
    这是多么恶毒的资本主义复辟的纲领！周扬们的头脑里，哪里还有一点点为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的影子？看起来，他们这时真是得意忘形了，以为可以“加紧”放手大干了。但是物极必反。他们正是由此而“加紧”彻底暴露了自己的修正主义面目。
    据我所知，在这以后，他们还干了许多吹捧王明的机会主义路线，反对毛泽东思想，进行资本主义复辟的罪恶活动。例如：
    一九六○年三月二日，《文学评论》和《文艺报》编辑部在周扬的指使下，联合召开纪念“左联”成立三十周年座谈会。《文艺报》发表了报道和文章。报道中竟然说：“左联从一九二九年秋天开始筹备到一九三○年三月成立，再到一九三六年初自动解散，又建立文艺界抗日民族统一战线组织，始终是在党的坚强领导下展开活动的。”“它高高举起了无产阶级革命文学的旗帜”，“将文化艺术的领导权掌握在党领导下的左翼手中”。他们简直把王明和周扬的机会主义路线捧到天上去了！
    周扬这个篡改历史的老手，早在一九五六年三月十四日（即紧接苏共二十大之后）就扬言：“我们很多同志都把延安文艺座谈会作为新文艺运动的开始，这是错误的。尤其错误的，有些人认为从老区来的才是代表正统的。事实上文艺座谈会又是从哪里来的呢？”到一九六一年七月，他又说：“旧民主主义时期没有出什么大作家，新民主主义革命时期出了很多大作家，《讲话》以后也没有出大作家。”
    周扬这样明目张胆地攻击毛主席，目的是把自己的一伙“大作家”、“大理论家”封为“正统”，实现他们复辟资本主义的大阴谋。
    同一时期，周扬一伙还有计划地通过拍电影来宣扬三十年代的文艺黑线。例如，一九五九年拍了《林家铺子》，一九六三、一九六四年相继拍了《早春二月》《舞台姐妹》等宣扬“三十年代”的大毒草。这是他们反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想活动的一个重要组成部分。
    周扬一伙还通过改写文学史，编写电影史等等罪恶活动，全面地篡改三十年代的历史，为他们自己树碑立传，为推行他们的三十年代资产阶级、修正主义文艺路线，制造“根据”。这一方面，已经有其他同志的文章揭露了。
    在三十年代，鲁迅和周扬们的斗争，是无产阶级文艺路线同资产阶级文艺路线的斗争。这一斗争，毛主席早就作了科学的总结。毛主席对以周扬为代表的三十年代资产阶级文艺路线的彻底的批判，从党的六届六中全会算起，已经二十八年了，从《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》算起，也已经二十四年了。这些批判，周扬等人是亲自听了的。他们表面上佯作接受，实际上始终拒绝毛主席的批判，始终拒绝改造他们的资产阶级世界观，始终拒绝贯彻执行毛主席的文艺路线，顽固地坚持他们那一条资产阶级、修正主义的文艺路线。他们对毛主席的批判怀恨在心，一有机会就进行疯狂的反扑。
    周扬们利用自己窃踞的文艺界的领导地位，一贯地进行反党反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动。毛主席提出少唱“洋八股”，他们偏偏多唱。毛主席提出“文艺为工农兵服务”的方向，他们偏偏反对文艺为工农兵服务，大搞“全民文艺”。毛主席指出鲁迅是“文化新军的最伟大和最英勇的旗手”，他们偏偏攻击鲁迅是“宗派主义”。他们攻击鲁迅，是为了攻击毛泽东思想，发泄他们对毛主席的仇恨！
    反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的周扬等人，他们在党和人民面前，使尽了两面派的手法，明里是人，暗里是鬼，阳奉阴违，两面三刀。他们是一伙地地道道的反党反人民的阴谋家。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，把周扬这一伙修正主义分子，完全暴露在光天化日之下。他们从三十年代到六十年代，在文艺界招降纳叛，拚命扩大队伍，同伟大的毛泽东思想唱反调，猖狂地反对我们英明的党中央和毛主席。现在，他们反党反人民的阴谋被彻底粉碎了。我们要齐声高呼：
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
