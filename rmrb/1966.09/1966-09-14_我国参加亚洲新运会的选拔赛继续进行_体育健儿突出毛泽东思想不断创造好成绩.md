China's selection trials for the first Asian New Force Games continued with five events on September 12 and 13. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, Chinese athletes have been creating outstanding results, breaking seven national records in the past two days.

Athletes appeared on the competition fields with a new spirit. They carried "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and reviewed Mao's teachings during breaks before and during the competitions, expressing their determination to "study Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

Nearly 100,000 spectators attended the selection trials over the past two days. They studied Mao's quotations, presented "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the athletes, collectively recited Mao's quotations, and sang revolutionary songs during the intervals. This high revolutionary enthusiasm greatly encouraged the athletes.

In the archery selection trials, Li Shulan, a female soldier from the People's Liberation Army who had broken the world record 17 times, remembered Mao's teaching, "Modesty helps one go forward, while conceit makes one lag behind." She continued to excel and won the first place in the women's 70-meter and 60-meter single-round competitions.

Over 100 athletes participated in the track and field selection trials, achieving excellent results over the past two days. Su Chengwen from Inner Mongolia displayed a brave and tireless revolutionary spirit in the men's 5,000-meter long-distance race. Amid the audience's enthusiastic applause, he finished the race in 14 minutes and 26.5 seconds, breaking his own national record of 14 minutes and 28.9 seconds. Hu Zurong, a pole vaulter from Shanghai, successfully cleared the 4.82-meter bar on his first attempt, breaking his own national record of 4.80 meters. After two days of intense competition, Wang Xuewen from Gansu and Wang Danyi from Hubei broke the national record of 6,770 points in the men's decathlon, with total scores of 6,917 points and 6,829 points, respectively. Famous high jumper Ni Zhicheng from Fujian also cleared a height of 2.18 meters.

The Beijing shooting range also reported good news over the past two days: On September 12, the People's Liberation Army Team One and a combined team from Shandong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi broke the national record of 1,552 points in the large-caliber rifle prone shooting team total score, with scores of 1,561 points and 1,560 points, respectively. The combined team also broke the national record of 4,449 points in the large-caliber rifle (prone, kneeling, standing) 40-shot event with a score of 4,454 points.

Xu Weihua also broke the national record of 548 points set by Wang Xiuchun in 1965 with an excellent score of 555 points, earning enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. On September 12, athletes from various regions who participated in the volleyball selection trials at the Beijing Workers' Stadium read Mao's quotations with the audience before the competition and shouted slogans such as "Long live the Communist Party of China!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" During the competition, the athletes displayed a brave and tenacious fighting spirit, showcasing their style and skills.

    据新华社十三日讯  我国参加第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会各项体育代表队的选拔赛，十二日和十三日又进行五个项目的比赛。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的我国体育健儿们，在为革命而比赛的思想指导下，两天来，创造了许多优异成绩，打破了七项全国纪录。
    运动员们都以崭新的精神面貌出现在各个比赛场上。他们拿着《毛主席语录》，利用赛前和比赛中的空隙时间一次又一次地重温毛主席的教导，表达了他们“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”的决心。
    两天来，前往各个比赛场、馆观看选拔赛的有近十万名观众。他们在观看比赛中，不时地学习毛主席语录，向运动员赠送毛主席语录，集体为运动员朗诵毛主席语录，并且在比赛间隙大唱革命歌曲。这种高昂的革命热情给予运动员们以很大的鼓舞。
    在射箭选拔赛中，曾连续十七次打破射箭世界纪录的解放军女选手李淑兰在比赛中牢记毛主席的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，再接再厉，获得了女子七十米和六十米单轮比赛的第一名。

    两天来，北京射击场也频频传来喜讯：十二日中国人民解放军一队和由山东、上海、江苏、江西选手组成的联一队，分别以一千五百六十一环和一千五百六十环的成绩打破大口径步枪卧射团体总成绩一千五百五十二环的全国纪录，联一队以四千四百五十四环的成绩打破大口径步枪（卧、跪、立）四十发四千四百四十九环的全国纪录。十三日由许维花、马艳云和张仕奎组成的中国人民解放军女子一队在女子手枪慢射比赛中，以一千六百三十七环的总成绩，打破了这个项目总成绩一千六百零五环的全国纪录。许维花还以五百五十五环的优异成绩打破了一九六五年由王秀琴保持的五百四十八环的全国纪录。博得了全场观众的热烈赞扬。十二日在北京工人体育馆参加排球选拔赛的各地选手们，在比赛前曾同观众一起朗读毛主席语录，并一起高呼“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”比赛中，运动员发扬了勇猛顽强的战斗精神，打出了风格和水平。
    十三日晚，北京体育学院二队同上海队还在北京工人体育场进行了足球选拔赛。他们在比赛中所表现的勇敢的战斗风格，得到了全场观众的好评。
