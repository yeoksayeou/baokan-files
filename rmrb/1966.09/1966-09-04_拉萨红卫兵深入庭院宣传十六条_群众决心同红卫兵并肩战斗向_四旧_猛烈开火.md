Lhasa's Red Guards and revolutionary youth have gone deep into various residents' committees and alleyways, actively promoting the Sixteen Points and Chairman Mao's quotations on destroying the old and establishing the new, making the significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution more deeply understood by the people.

When the Red Guards from Lhasa Middle School arrived at the Fourth Residents' Committee of the Deji Road Office, they found members of the Seventh Agricultural Production Mutual Aid Group threshing grain. The Red Guards immediately took over the flails from the farmers and joined in the labor. They then elected Losang Jie as a representative to explain to the group members the Red Guards' determination to thoroughly smash the old world and build a new world according to Chairman Mao's teachings. The group members unanimously expressed their support for the Red Guards' revolutionary actions, vowing to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, and sweep away all ghosts and monsters.

The Red Guards went to a courtyard with many elderly people to conduct propaganda. They read Chairman Mao's relevant quotations and performed skits on destroying the old and establishing the new. Many elderly people stood up to denounce the crimes of the serf system, expressing their determination to eliminate all remnants of the old society together with the Red Guards. The Red Guards from the Autonomous Region Normal School, while promoting the destruction of the "Four Olds" and the establishment of the "Four News" in remote alleys and residential courtyards, received praise from the residents: "You have brought us Chairman Mao's instructions. You are truly good red successors." The residents expressed their determination to fight side by side with the Red Guards under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, to launch a fierce attack on the old world, and to build a new world together!

    拉萨红卫兵深入庭院宣传十六条
    群众决心同红卫兵并肩战斗向“四旧”猛烈开火
    据新华社拉萨一日电　拉萨市的红卫兵小将和革命青少年，深入到各居民委员会和庭院小巷，积极宣传十六条和毛主席有关破旧立新的语录，使无产阶级文化大革命的意义更加深入人心。
    当拉萨中学的红卫兵们来到德吉路办事处第四居民委员会时，正遇上第七农业生产互助组的组员在打场，红卫兵们立即接过农民手里的连枷参加劳动，并推举洛桑格列作为代表，向组员们讲解红卫兵们坚决按照毛主席的教导，彻底砸碎旧世界、建设新世界的决心。组员们纷纷表示：坚决支持红卫兵的革命行动，好好学习毛主席著作，将文化大革命进行到底，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    红卫兵们来到老人较多的一个大院子里进行宣传。他们宣读了毛主席的有关语录，表演了破旧立新的节目。许多老人纷纷起来控诉农奴制度的罪恶，表示要和红卫兵一起把旧社会遗留下来的一切残余全部消灭干净。自治区师范学校的红卫兵们在偏僻小巷、居民大院进行破“四旧”立“四新”宣传的时候，居民们称赞他们说：你们给我们送来了毛主席的指示，你们真是红色的好后代。居民们表示一定要在伟大领袖毛主席的指挥下，和红卫兵们并肩战斗，向旧世界猛烈开火，共同建设新世界！
