In recent days, militiamen from Guangxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Fujian, along with people of various ethnic groups in Dongxing County, have held numerous rallies to vehemently condemn the U.S. air pirates for invading our airspace, dropping bombs, and strafing, which resulted in injuries to our commune members. At various rallies, militiamen armed with Mao Zedong Thought firmly declared that they must maintain high revolutionary vigilance, grip their weapons tightly, and closely coordinate with the People's Liberation Army to severely punish any invading enemy.

In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, over the past few days, from Youyi Pass to the banks of the Beilun River, from the fishing ports of Beibu Gulf to the villages in the Ten Thousand Mountains, militiamen of various ethnic groups have unanimously issued the strongest condemnation of the crimes committed by American imperialism: "Listen, American bandits, if you come, we will fight you without hesitation. Whether you come from the air, sea, or land, we will break your backbone and completely, thoroughly, and cleanly annihilate the invading bandits!" Lin Zeqi, a veteran soldier who fought against American imperialism in the Korean War and an excellent machine gunner from Dongxing Town, led the militiamen to study Chairman Mao's teachings on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers immediately after the September 9th battle, further raising the militiamen's class consciousness and strengthening their war preparedness.

The entire militia unit of the port heroes in Guangdong Province vehemently denounced the new heinous crimes committed by American imperialism. Peng Jincai, a militiaman who was awarded the Second-Class Merit Citation for annihilating American and Kuomintang armed spies, said: "Chairman Mao said, 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic.' Many facts have proven that this judgment is absolutely correct. Currently, American imperialism is continuously expanding its aggressive war. We must better arm ourselves with Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war, seriously prepare for war, and coordinate with the People's Liberation Army to resolutely fight American imperialism to the end."

Militiamen of various ethnic groups in Yunnan Province have held rallies to condemn the crimes of American imperialism. At the rally in Malipo County, Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Chen Yingze, the platoon leader of the Zhuang militia, sternly warned the American aggressors: "We are highly vigilant. If you insist on imposing war on our people, we will, together with the People's Liberation Army, drown you invaders in the vast sea of our entire nation's armed forces."

The crimes of the U.S. air pirates have enraged the militiamen on the front lines of Fujian. Militiamen near the enemy-occupied island of Jinmen held rallies in fields, by the sea, and on the battlefield. Hong Xiucen, the political instructor of the militia camp on Xiaoyang Island and a representative of the National People's Congress, said: "We warn American imperialism that no matter how high you escalate the war, you cannot save yourselves from death. We militiamen are fully prepared for battle and will bury any invading enemy at any time."

Currently, the militiamen along our coastal and border defenses are further studying Chairman Mao's teachings on people's war, intensively training their combat skills, closely monitoring the aggressive activities of American imperialism, maintaining high vigilance, and preparing to severely strike any invading enemy.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanning on the 17th, people from all walks of life in Dongxing County and the cities of Pingxiang and Beihai in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have held rallies in recent days to vehemently condemn the U.S. air pirates for invading our airspace, bombing, and strafing, which resulted in injuries to our commune members and the death of livestock.

On the evening of the 17th, a rally of ten thousand people was held in Dongxing Town, the seat of Dongxing County. People of various ethnic groups raised their fists and shouted, "Down with American imperialism! Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" After the rally, more than ten thousand people participated in a grand anti-American demonstration march.

Fishermen in Beihai City, who were working hard at the port, immediately held a rally at the port upon hearing of the atrocities committed by the U.S. air pirates. McCai Hongmin, a member of the Caotian Fishery Commune, said, "American imperialism killed and injured many of our fishermen in international waters last year. My father was one of those killed by American pirate planes last year. American pirate planes recently bombed and strafed our cargo ships, killing nine crew members. Now, they have brazenly invaded our airspace and injured our commune members. Blood debts must be repaid with blood. We are already prepared. Let American imperialism come if they dare; we will annihilate as many as come."

The militiamen of Kunming First Medical School in Yunnan were outraged by the U.S. imperialist pirate planes invading Dongxing County in Guangxi, strafing, and firing rockets, which injured three of our commune members. They held a rally to strongly protest the serious war provocations committed by American imperialism.

    广西广东云南福建民兵和东兴县各族人民纷纷集会
    愤怒声讨美国强盗的战争挑衅
    据新华社十八日讯  连日来，广西、广东、云南、福建等地的广大民兵，纷纷举行集会，愤怒声讨美国空中强盗侵入我领空，投弹扫射，打伤我公社社员的滔天罪行。在各种集会上，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大民兵坚定地表示，一定要保持高度革命警惕，紧握手中武器，密切配合人民解放军严惩一切敢于来犯的敌人。
    在广西壮族自治区，几天来，从友谊关下到北仑河畔，从北部湾渔港到十万大山村寨，各族民兵一致发出了声讨美帝国主义罪行的最强音：美国强盗听着，你要来，我就打，决不客气。不管你从空中来，海上来，还是陆上来，我们一定要打断你的脊骨，坚决、彻底、全部、干净地把入侵的强盗消灭掉！在朝鲜战场上曾和美帝国主义较量过的复员军人、东兴镇民兵优秀机枪射手林泽喜，在九日战斗一结束，就带领民兵学习毛主席有关帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论述，进一步提高民兵的阶级觉悟和加强战备观念。
    广东省港口英雄民兵连全体民兵愤怒地谴责美帝国主义犯下的新的滔天罪行。歼灭美蒋武装特务荣立二等功的民兵彭锦才说：毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”很多事实证明这一论断无比正确。目前美帝国主义不断扩大侵略战争，我们要更好地用毛主席的人民战争思想武装头脑，认真做好战争准备，配合人民解放军，坚决和美帝国主义斗争到底。
    云南省各族民兵，纷纷举行声讨美帝罪行的大会。在文山壮族苗族自治州麻栗坡县，各族民兵的声讨大会上，壮族民兵连连长陈应择严正警告美国侵略者：我们是有高度戒备的，如果你们硬要把战争强加在我国人民头上，那我们将和人民解放军一起，把你们这些侵略强盗，淹没在我国全民皆兵的汪洋大海之中。
    美帝国主义空中强盗的罪行，激怒了福建前线广大民兵。与敌占岛金门一水之隔的民兵们在田间、海边和阵地上，举行了声讨大会。全国人民代表大会代表、小嶝岛民兵营教导员洪秀枞说：我们要警告美帝国主义，无论你把战争升到那一级，也挽救不了死亡命运。我们民兵已做好一切战斗准备，随时埋葬来犯的敌人。
    现在，我海防、边防的广大民兵，正在进一步学习毛主席关于人民战争的论述，加紧苦练杀敌本领，密切注视着美帝国主义的侵略活动，百倍警惕，随时准备着狠狠地打击来犯的敌人。
    据新华社南宁十七日电　广西壮族自治区东兴各族自治县和凭祥、北海市的各界人民，连日来纷纷举行集会，愤怒声讨美国空中强盗入侵我国领空，轰炸扫射，打伤我公社社员、打死耕畜的滔天罪行。
    十七日晚，东兴各族自治县所在地东兴镇举行了万人大会。各族人民愤怒地振臂高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“血债一定要用血来还！”会后，一万多人举行了声势浩大的反美示威大游行。
    正在海港紧张劳动的北海市渔船的社员们，听到美国空中强盗的暴行后，立即在港口举行了声讨大会。咸田渔业公社社员麦恒民说，美帝去年在公海上打死打伤我渔民多人，我父亲就是去年被美国强盗飞机打死的。美国强盗飞机最近又轰炸扫射我国货船，打死船员九人。现在又悍然侵入我国领空打伤我公社社员，血债一定要用血来还。我们已经准备好了，美帝要来就来吧，来多少就消灭它多少。（附图片）
    云南昆明市第一卫生学校的民兵，对于美帝国主义强盗飞机入侵我广西东兴各族自治县，扫射并发射火箭，打伤我三名公社社员的罪行，义愤填膺。他们举行集会，强烈抗议美帝国主义严重的战争挑衅罪行。
