At noon on July 18th until late at night, a piece of good news was repeatedly broadcast in various language programs on the Mogadishu radio station: The Chinese medical team successfully performed the first heart surgery in Somalia's history.

The news quickly spread to various parts of Somalia. The next day, at the hospital in Mogadishu where Chinese doctors work, a steady stream of visitors came, some even traveling from over a hundred kilometers away. They saw the patient who had undergone heart surgery lying quietly in bed, and they could not suppress their excitement. They expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese medical staff who, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, devoted themselves to serving the people of Somalia.

The patient, named Muhammad Sufi Abukar, was a 17-year-old student. He had been suffering from a heart condition for five years. He had previously gone to the Dikfe Hospital, run by the "European Common Market," for treatment. A Western doctor diagnosed him with a shrinking heart, saying there was no effective treatment. The patient stayed in the hospital for several months, but his condition did not improve, and he was eventually discharged. Thus, the patient's father, with his last hope, brought him to the hospital where Chinese doctors worked.

After diagnosis by the Chinese doctors, it was confirmed that the patient suffered from mitral stenosis. The only treatment method was to perform a mitral valve commissurotomy. However, the Chinese medical team had only one cardiac surgeon, and the hospital lacked the necessary medical equipment and drugs.

At this critical moment, the Chinese medical staff, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought for a long time, deeply realized their internationalist responsibility and understood that they should be extremely responsible in their work and extremely enthusiastic towards the Somali people. Western doctors had turned the patient away, but the Chinese medical staff were determined to save him. Following the teachings of Chairman Mao, they resolved to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. They held three meetings to repeatedly study each step of the surgery and carefully checked the instruments. On the night before the surgery, the entire team practiced heart surgery on animals.

At 9 AM on July 18th, the surgeon went onto the operating table, and other doctors, nurses, and Somali medical staff worked closely together. They used an expander designed and manufactured in China to successfully complete the surgery in two hours.

The success of the surgery was a crystallization of the internationalist spirit of the Chinese medical staff who devoted themselves to serving the people of Somalia. After the surgery, the entire team participated in the care. For an entire week, they took turns on duty day and night. A Somali friend exclaimed, "Sleeping by the patient's side to take care of them—this is something other foreign doctors cannot do."

The success of the surgery was also a crystallization of the friendship between China and Somalia. The Chinese doctors received care and cooperation from the Somali government and people from beginning to end. During the surgery, the hospital director Hassan repeatedly called the Ministry of Health to report the situation and often stood outside the operating room waiting for the good news of the surgery's success. The president of the Somali News Agency visited the hospital almost every day in the days following the surgery to inquire about the patient's condition and promptly report to the nation.

The success of the surgery once again brought the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought to the hearts of the Somali people. They expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese government and to the most beloved great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. The Somali Minister of Health, Bashir Ismail, said to the Chinese doctors, "You serve the Somali people with all your heart. Your success in Somalia is also a source of pride for the Somali people." No one was more moved than the patient's father, who said, "I thank the Chinese government and Chairman Mao. I and my descendants will never forget you!"

However, the imperialists were very uneasy, jealous, and hostile towards the success of the Chinese doctors' surgery. They used every trick to cause trouble and sabotage. The surgery required an oxygen tank connector. The Western staff managing the medical equipment at the hospital created many obstacles, but they did not succeed. During the surgery, a Western surgeon, who was supposedly a medical "authority" living in Somalia for many years, was reportedly pacing in his office at the Dikfe Hospital, four kilometers away, clutching the telephone receiver and repeatedly asking the Western nuns working with the Chinese doctors, "Has the patient died?" When the answer was completely opposite to his wishes, he raged like a mad lion and refused to see any visitors.

After the news of the successful surgery spread, those imperialists secretly discussed countermeasures, attempting to prevent the Somali media from reporting this event that symbolized Sino-Somali friendship and trying every means to destroy the photos related to the surgery for newspaper publication. However, the news was finally published, and the photos were finally printed. At this time, someone even offered a reward to harm the patient, but their plot failed.

After more than twenty days of meticulous treatment and care by the Chinese medical staff, in mid-August, the Somali youth was discharged from the hospital, full of vitality and radiant. The Chinese medical team, with their internationalist spirit and extremely responsible and enthusiastic work, made a new contribution to the development of Sino-Somali friendship. They once again brought the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought to the land of Somalia, known as the "Horn of Africa."

### 毛泽东思想在“非洲之角”大放光芒——记中国医疗队在索马里施行心脏手术成功

    毛泽东思想在“非洲之角”大放光芒
    ——记中国医疗队在索马里施行心脏手术成功
    七月十八日中午到深夜，一则喜讯从摩加迪沙电台的各种语言节目中，迭次播送出来：中国医疗队成功地做了索马里历史上第一次心脏手术。
    消息立刻传到索马里各地。第二天，在摩加迪沙市中国医生工作的医院里，成群的访问者川流不息，有的甚至是从百公里以外赶来的。他们看到动了心脏手术的病人安静地躺在床上，都抑制不住兴奋的心情，对在毛泽东思想教导下全心全意为索马里人民服务的中国医务人员，倾吐最美好的赞辞。
    病人名叫穆罕默德·索非·阿布卡，是一个十七岁的中学生。心脏病已经折磨了他五年。他曾经先到“欧洲共同市场”开办的狄克弗医院去治疗。一个西方国家的医生的诊断是，心脏缩小，无良医妙药可救。病人在这所医院里一住数月，病情始终不见好转，就被推出院门了。于是，病人的父亲怀着最后的希望，带着他来到中国医生工作的医院。
    经中国医生确诊，病人患的是心脏二尖瓣狭窄症。唯一的治疗方法是施行二尖瓣扩张分离手术。但是，中国医疗队中仅有一名心脏外科医师，医院里必要的医疗器械和药品也缺少。
    在这样的时刻，在毛泽东思想长期哺育下的中国医务人员深深地意识到自己的国际主义责任，懂得应该对工作极端的负责，对索马里兄弟极端的热忱。西方国家的医生把病人逐出门外，中国医务人员要把他挽救过来。中国医疗队按照毛主席的教导，下定决心，排除万难，去争取胜利。他们召开了三次会议，反复研究手术中的各个环节，周密地检查了器械。在手术前的一个晚上，全体人员还作了动物的心脏手术练习。
    七月十八日上午九时，外科医生上了手术台，其他医生、护士们以及索马里医务人员也密切合作。他们使用中国设计制造的扩张器，在两小时内顺利地完成了手术。
    手术的成功，是中国医务人员全心全意为索马里人民服务的国际主义精神的结晶。手术后，全队人员都参加了护理。整整一个星期，他们通宵达旦地轮流值班。一位索马里朋友万分感慨地说：“睡在病人身旁照顾病人，这是其他外国医生做不到的。”
    手术的成功，也是中国和索马里友谊的结晶。中国医生自始至终得到索马里政府和人民的关怀和合作。在手术进行时，医院院长哈桑多次用电话向卫生部报告情况，并且多次站在手术室的门外等待手术成功的好消息。索马里新闻社社长在手术完成后的头几天，几乎每天都亲自到医院探问病人的情况，随时向全国人民发布消息。
    手术的成功，又一次地把毛泽东思想的光辉带到了索马里人民的心灵里。他们用发自肺腑的语言感谢中国政府，感谢中国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。索马里卫生部长巴希尔·伊斯梅尔对中国医生说：“你们为索马里人民服务是一心一意的。你们在索马里取得了成功，这也是索马里人民的骄傲。”最激动的莫过于病人的父亲，他说：“我感谢中国政府，感谢毛泽东主席。我和我的子孙永远也忘不了你们！”
    可是，帝国主义者对中国医生手术的成功，十分不安、嫉妒和仇视。他们用尽心计进行捣乱破坏。进行手术，需要一个氧气筒接头。医院里管理医疗器材的西方国家人员就多方刁难，但是没有得逞。手术进行时，远在四公里外的狄克弗医院的一个西方国家的外科主任，据说是在索马里居住了多年的医学“权威”，在办公室内如坐针毡，手里紧抓着电话听筒，连连地询问在中国医生工作的医院里的西方国家的修女们：“病人死了没有？”当得到的回答同他的愿望完全相反时，他暴怒得像一头发疯的狮子，对一切来访者都厌烦地拒之门外。
    手术成功的喜讯传出后，那些帝国主义分子又密商对策，企图阻挠索马里新闻部门报道这件象征中索友谊的喜事，并且想方设法要把供报纸刊登的有关这一手术的照片毁掉。但是，消息终于发表了，照片终于刊登了。这时候，竟然有人出重赏企图谋害病人，但是他们的阴谋失败了。
    经过中国医务人员二十多天的精心治疗和护理，八月中旬，这位索马里少年精神勃勃、容光焕发地出院了。中国医疗队用国际主义精神和极端负责、极端热忱的工作，为中索友谊的发展作出了新的贡献。他们又一次地把毛泽东思想的光辉带到了被称为“非洲之角”的索马里的大地上。
