	*The Jinbu Daily* Launches Today

	Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: The *Beijing Daily* has been renamed to *Jinbu Daily* and will launch today.

	The inaugural issue of the *Jinbu Daily* features an editorial titled *To Our Readers*, which states that the newspaper is born in the midst of the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a triumphant product of the Red Guards and revolutionary masses' campaign to smash the "four olds" and establish the "four news." The newspaper will focus on propaganda and reporting related to finance and trade.

	*To Our Readers* emphasizes that the *Jinbu Daily*'s fundamental task is to hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and promptly, swiftly, and accurately convey Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's policies to the masses. It aims to arm the broad masses of finance and trade workers with Mao Zedong Thought and guide finance and trade work, as well as related light industry, handicraft production, and agricultural production, with Mao Zedong Thought.

	*To Our Readers* states: The *Jinbu Daily* is the newspaper of all finance and trade workers across the nation. It should become a beloved publication and close comrade-in-arms of the workers. It is a powerful tool for the workers to educate themselves, eliminate bourgeois elements, and promote proletarian ideals; it is an important bastion for finance and trade workers to learn, implement, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought.

	*To Our Readers* further stresses that in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the *Jinbu Daily* must charge forward in the battle to smash the old and establish the new within the finance and trade sector. It must also, in the midst of great struggle, great criticism, and great reform, thoroughly smash the old ideas, old style, and old frameworks of bourgeois newspaper management, and establish new ideas, new style, and new characteristics of proletarian newspaper management. It should strive to achieve the following:

	1. Be bold and forthright, with a revolutionary proletarian fighting spirit.
	2. Be rich in content, with clear focus, and have distinct characteristics.
	3. Be concise and precise, with clear language, and skillfully use the language of the masses, creating a style that the masses love to read and hear.

	The *Jinbu Daily* is a tabloid, published every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

    新华社十四日讯  北京《大公报》改名的《前进报》，十五日创刊。
    《前进报》创刊号发表的《告读者》首先说，它是在无产阶级文化大革命新高潮中诞生的，是红卫兵和革命群众破“四旧”立“四新”大进军中的胜利产物。它是以财贸为宣传报道重点的报纸。
    《告读者》着重指出：《前进报》最根本的任务是，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力宣传毛泽东思想，及时、迅速、正确地把毛主席的指示，把党的方针政策传达给群众，用毛泽东思想去武装广大财贸职工群众的头脑，用毛泽东思想指导财贸工作以及同财贸工作有密切联系的轻工业、手工业生产和农业生产。
    《告读者》说：《前进报》是全国财贸职工自己的报纸。它应当成为职工群众心爱的读物和亲密的战友。它是财贸职工自己教育自己的、灭资兴无的有力工具；是财贸职工学习毛泽东思想、贯彻毛泽东思想、宣传毛泽东思想、捍卫毛泽东思想的重要阵地。
    《告读者》还强调说，《前进报》在当前无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中，既要为财贸部门破旧立新而冲锋陷阵，更要在大斗争、大批判、大改革中，大破资产阶级办报的旧思想、旧报风、旧框框，大立无产阶级办报的新思想、新报风、新风格。要努力做到：
    一，旗帜鲜明，尖锐泼辣，具有革命无产阶级应有的战斗风格。
    二，内容丰富，重点突出，具有鲜明的特色。
    三，短小精悍，文字简明，善于运用群众语言，具有群众喜闻乐见的文风。
