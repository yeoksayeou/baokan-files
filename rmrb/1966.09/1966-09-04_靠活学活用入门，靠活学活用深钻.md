	Mastering Through Active Learning and Application
	Soldier Yin Jinman

	In studying Chairman Mao's works, we must not only master the basics through active learning and application, but also delve deeper through continuous practice. We need to explore the depths of this "treasure trove" of Chairman Mao's works using the key of active learning and application. Chairman Mao said, "Entering the door is not difficult, and deepening one's knowledge is also achievable, as long as one has the heart and the ability to learn." Comrade Lin Biao's advocacy for active learning and application is precisely about learning effectively. As long as we persist in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, we will surely be able to deepen our understanding.

	I have a low level of education. When I first joined the army, I found it hard to grasp philosophical works. Later, my platoon leader and comrades helped me analyze various things using the dialectical method. Especially through the criticism of Yang Xianzhen's fallacy of "combining two into one," I gradually began to understand Chairman Mao's philosophical thoughts.

	Once, a comrade in my squad did not accept my criticism, and I was afraid it would affect our unity, so I let it go. But then I thought, isn't this just "combining two into one," smoothing things over? No, I must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "one divides into two" and seek unity through struggle. But what if the other person still doesn't accept it? After thinking for a while, I used the method of "one divides into two" again, considering not only the other person's side but also my own. I realized that my attitude in giving feedback was not entirely correct. This way, when I talked to the comrade again, I first criticized myself and then pointed out the other person's shortcomings. This approach worked well. It made me realize that using the method of "combining two into one" only leads to false unity, while using the method of "one divides into two" can achieve genuine unity. This is how I often learn and often apply Chairman Mao's philosophical works. Now, when I read "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," I not only understand them better but can also apply them effectively.

    靠活学活用入门，靠活学活用深钻
    战士　殷金满
    我们学习毛主席著作，不光靠活学活用入门，还得靠活学活用深钻。我们要到毛主席著作这个“宝库”的深处取宝，靠的还是活学活用这把金钥匙。毛主席说：“入门既不难，深造也是办得到的，只要有心，只要善于学习罢了。”林彪副主席提出的活学活用，就是指的要善于学习。只要坚持活学活用毛主席著作，就一定能够深造。
    我这个人文化水平低，才参军时，拿起哲学著作硬是啃不动。后来指导员和同志们就帮我用一分为二的观点分析各种事物。特别是通过对杨献珍的“合二而一”谬论的批判，使我对毛主席的哲学思想，逐步有了一些理解。
    一次，班里一个同志没接受我的批评，我怕影响团结，就不再管了。又一想，这不就是“合二而一”、抹稀泥了吗？不行！一定要按毛主席一分为二的教导，通过斗争去求得团结。可是再谈人家还是不接受怎么办？憋了半天，我又用上一分为二了，不光想了人家一方，也想到自己这一方，想到自己提意见的态度也有不够正确的地方。这样，我再去和那个同志交谈，首先做了自我批评，接着又批评了对方的缺点，这样做效果很好。这使我懂得了搞“合二而一”只能搞假团结，运用一分为二的方法才能达到真正的团结。我就是这样经常学经常用，对毛主席的哲学著作越来懂的越多。现在拿起《实践论》、《矛盾论》，不仅基本上可以看懂，而且也能用得上了。
