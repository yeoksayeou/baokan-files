On the twentieth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Concentrate Superior Forces to Defeat the Enemy One by One," commanders and political workers of a certain unit in the People's Liberation Army reviewed this work by Chairman Mao, recalled the historical facts of the war at that time, and discussed their personal experiences. They unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thought of "concentrate superior forces to defeat the enemy one by one" played an immeasurably great role in winning victories in revolutionary wars in various historical periods of the Chinese revolution. Today, this brilliant thought is guiding the revolutionary people in many regions of the world to wage heroic armed struggles against imperialism and reactionary forces in various countries.

Deputy Political Commissar of the Military Political Department, Xu Wei, said: Twenty years ago, when the Chinese People's Liberation War had just begun, Chiang Kai-shek's several million troops, with the support of American imperialism and relying on American equipment, launched a large-scale attack on the liberated areas. On the Northeast battlefield, the enemy was arrogant, boasting that they would occupy the entire Northeast in three months. At that time, our troops had just arrived in the Northeast, and in terms of numbers and equipment, we were at a disadvantage. Some people wondered: What will the future of the war be like? Can we defeat the enemy? How can we defeat the enemy? During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our troops mainly fought guerrilla warfare, and a single company could hold half the sky; now, large forces are concentrated to fight mobile warfare, and not only the soldiers but also the commanders are not very familiar with it. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao issued the directive "Concentrate Superior Forces to Defeat the Enemy One by One." Mao Zedong Thought, like a guiding light, pointed out the direction and methods for us, strengthened our confidence and courage to defeat the Kuomintang bandits.

Chairman Mao directed: "Concentrate six times, or five times, or four times the enemy's forces, or at least three times the enemy's forces, at the appropriate time, first surround and annihilate the enemy's one regiment (or battalion). This regiment (or battalion) should be the weakest among the enemy's regiments or the one with the least assistance... After success, depending on the situation, annihilate one more regiment or several regiments of the enemy..." Following Chairman Mao's directive, under the personal command of Comrade Lin Biao, our army first crossed the Songhua River from the north bank to the south, and first surrounded and annihilated an enemy camp that had extended to the riverbank at Qitamu with one of our regiments. At the same time, another regiment was in ambush at Zhangmazi Gully, surrounding the 113th Regiment of the New First Army (missing one company) coming to reinforce from Jitai. At Mulishui, one regiment captured an enemy security regiment, and at Jiaojialing, the enemy's 150th Regiment of the New First Army was also surrounded by our forces several times their number. Although the enemy was arrogant at the time and fully equipped with American weapons, the enemy was isolated and helpless and was eventually annihilated one by one under the attack of our superior forces. As Chairman Mao pointed out, this tactic is "one, to annihilate completely; two, to decide quickly." When the enemy's main force attacked, we had already retreated back to the north bank of the Songhua River. When the enemy retreated, we crossed the river again, concentrated our forces, and made a long-distance raid, annihilating the 89th Regiment of the New First Army at Chengzijing in one fell swoop.

Our army's continuous victories in annihilating the enemy frightened the enemy. The reinforcements fled, and the enemy in Jitai and Nongan also abandoned the city and fled. Whole regiments of the enemy dared not operate outside. At this time, our army had a large number of liberated peasants joining, a large number of captured soldiers replenishing the troops, and we were equipped with weapons captured from the enemy. Our army became unprecedentedly strong. Following this, we crossed the river three more times, concentrated superior forces, and annihilated the enemy by whole regiments. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's operational thinking, in less than a year, more than a million enemy troops were annihilated on various battlefields across the country, and the counteroffensive stage began.

Deputy Political Commissar of the Army, Xing Ze, said: The enemy in the Northeast was very fierce at the beginning, and we ate it up one bite at a time. At first, we had small victories, and gradually, we had big victories. In the Liaoshen Campaign, when the enemy thought we were "training troops to attack Changchun," we had already secretly concentrated absolutely superior forces to surround Jinzhou. With a small number of troops, we blocked the enemy coming from the sea and Shenyang at Tashan and Liaoxi, respectively, and at the same time, continued to besiege Changchun with a part of the troops. Due to the concentration of the main force, more than ten million enemy troops in Jinzhou were annihilated in thirty-one hours. The enemy's passage into the pass was blocked, forcing nearly ten million enemy troops in Changchun to surrender and defect. After the battle of Jinzhou, our main force quickly moved to the Liaoxi battlefield, encircled and annihilated more than ten million enemy troops reinforcing Jinzhou with absolutely superior forces. Then, we raided Shenyang and achieved another major encirclement and annihilation. In the Liaoshen Campaign, following Chairman Mao's directive, we concentrated superior forces three times to annihilate the enemy one by one. At that time, the Northeast Liberation Army of only a few hundred thousand people annihilated 472,000-plus Kuomintang bandits in the Northeast, achieving a decisive victory with significant domestic and international influence.

Battalion Commander Chen Dejun said: This tactic is also effective in mobile warfare and siege warfare. When our army entered the pass to attack Tianjin, the enemy in Tianjin had 130,000 troops, boasting that they were "as solid as a rock." Our army concentrated six armies to attack, not only concentrating absolutely superior forces in the battle deployment but also concentrating absolutely superior forces in tactics. At that time, our troops were responsible for the main attack, and at the breakthrough point, we used the strength of more than two armies, concentrating a large amount of firepower. As a result, the Tianjin city defense was breached in just three minutes; in more than a day, all 130,000 defending enemy troops were annihilated.

Not only when the enemy was strong and we were weak, our army relied on concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one; even when we were strong and the enemy was weak, we also relied on concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy completely. This is how our army fought in Tianjin, how we fought in the southward advance, and how we fought in suppressing bandits after victory. Only in this way can we not just drive away or disperse the enemy but completely annihilate it.

### 一口一口把敌人吃掉

专栏：

    在毛主席的《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》这一光辉著作发表二十周年前夕，解放军某部指挥员和政治工作人员，重温了毛主席这一著作，回忆当年战争史实，畅谈了自己的切身感受。一致认为：毛主席关于“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”这一战略战术思想，在中国革命的各个历史时期，对于争取革命战争的胜利，起到了不可估量的巨大作用。今天，这一光辉思想，正指导着世界许多地区的革命人民，向帝国主义和各国反动派展开英勇的武装斗争。
    一口一口把敌人吃掉
    军政治部副主任徐炜说：二十年前中国人民解放战争刚刚开始的时候，蒋介石几百万军队，在美帝国主义的支持下，依靠美式装备，向解放区大举进攻。在东北战场，敌人气势汹汹，叫嚷三个月要占领全东北。当时，我们部队初到东北，在数量和装备上都处于劣势。有些人就考虑：战争前途怎么样？能不能打败敌人？怎样打败敌人？在抗日战争时期，我们部队主要打的是游击战，一个连就能顶半边天；现在大部队集中起来打运动战，不仅是战士，就是指挥员也不大熟悉。在这关键时刻，毛主席发出了《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》的指示。毛泽东思想像指路明灯一样，给我们指出了方向，指出了办法，增强了战胜蒋匪军的信心和勇气。
    毛主席指示：“集中六倍、或五倍、或四倍于敌的兵力、至少也要有三倍于敌的兵力，于适当时机，首先包围歼击敌军的一个旅（或团）。这个旅（或团），应当是敌军诸旅中较弱的，或者是较少援助的……得手后，依情况，或者再歼敌军一个旅至几个旅……”遵照毛主席这一指示，在林彪同志的亲自指挥下，我军第一次从松花江北岸南下，就先以一个师包围了敌人伸到了江边其塔木的一个营，同时又以一个师预伏在张麻子沟，围住了从九台来援的新一军一一三团（缺一个营）。在沐石河以一个师抓住敌人一个保安团，在焦家岭也以超出敌人数倍的兵力，困住新一军一五○团。敌人虽然傲极一时，又是全部美械装备，但是敌人孤立无援，在我军的优势兵力攻击下，终于逐个被歼。正像毛主席指出的，这种战法就是“一能全歼；二能速决”。当敌人主力扑来时，我们已退回松花江北岸了。敌人退去时，我们又二下江南，集中兵力，长途奔袭，一举歼灭了城子街的新一军八十九团。
    我军连续歼灭敌人的胜利，敌人吓破了胆。援敌逃了，守在九台、农安的敌人也弃城逃跑，整团的敌人不敢在外边活动了。而这时，我军则有大批翻身农民入伍，大批俘虏兵补入部队，用缴获的武器装备了自己，我军空前壮大了。接着三下江南，集中优势兵力，整师地歼灭了敌人。在毛主席这一作战思想指导下，经过了不到一年的短短时间，全国各个战场歼灭敌人有生力量一百多万，转入了大反攻阶段。
    军副政治委员邢泽说：东北战场的敌人开始很凶，我们就是这样一口一口把它吃掉的。开始我们是小打小胜，逐渐就大打大胜。在辽沈战役中，当敌人还以为我们要“练好兵打长春”的时候，我们已经隐蔽地集中绝对优势兵力围住了锦州。以少部分部队，分别在塔山和辽西堵击从海上和沈阳来援的敌人，同时以一部分部队继续围困长春。由于主力集中，三十一个小时就全歼锦州守敌十万多人。敌人进关的口子被堵死了，迫使长春近十万敌人不得不起义和投诚。打完锦州，我军主力部队迅速拉到辽西战场，分割包围了西援锦州的十几万敌人，以绝对优势兵力将其歼灭。然后奔袭沈阳，又来了一个大聚歼。辽沈战役中，按照毛主席的指示，连续三次集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人，当时只有几十万人的东北解放军，全歼了东北蒋匪军四十七万二千多人，取得了国内外有重大影响的决定性胜利。
    团长陈德俊说：野战用这个战法百战百胜，攻坚也是一样。我军入关打天津，天津守敌十三万，自吹“固若金汤”。我军集中六个军打，不仅在战役布署上集中了绝对优势兵力，在战术上也集中了绝对优势兵力。当时我们部队担任主攻，在突破点上，就用了两个多军兵力，集中了大量炮火。结果仅三分钟就突破了天津城防；一天多时间，就全歼守敌十三万。
    不仅在敌强我弱时，我军依靠集中优势兵力各个歼灭敌人；在我强敌弱的情况下，也依靠集中优势兵力全歼敌人。我军打天津是这样，大军南下作战是这样，胜利后剿匪也是这样。只有这样，才不是把敌人打跑、打散，而是彻底把它消灭。
