Mao Zedong's voice is stirring the hearts of people around the world. The people of Algeria love Chairman Mao's revolutionary theories and diligently study Chairman Mao's works.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, September 24th: Recently, Algerian workers, farmers, old guerrillas, students, and people from other walks of life have enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao Zedong as "the leader of the world's people" and expressed their determination to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought.

An old guerrilla named Majani said: "In the early days of the Algerian liberation war, we already knew about Mao Zedong. It was he who taught us how to strike the enemy and how to strive for liberation. The Chinese brothers gave us selfless aid, the most precious of which is Mao Zedong's revolutionary theory. Mao Zedong is the leader of the world's people, the greatest revolutionary hero in the world. He serves the Chinese people and also serves the people of the whole world."

An old worker from Algiers, Bentorba, said: "I read Mao Zedong's books and feel that he always speaks for the people. Mao Zedong says that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, which is completely correct."

A farmer from the outskirts of Algiers, Mazoug, recently watched the Chinese film "Dazhai Fields." He said: "You are advancing along the self-reliant path proposed by Mao Zedong, and your farmers live very happily. Mao Zedong is with the workers and peasants, understands their hearts, and cares about the people's lives. He is the best leader."

Some young people are studying Chairman Mao's works while taking notes, and they also write Chairman Mao's quotations in small notebooks they carry with them. A university student read Chairman Mao's philosophical works and wrote several pages of study notes.

A journalist, Semar, said: "I think Mao Zedong is the outstanding leader of the world revolution. In contemporary history, there is no such outstanding leader like Mao Zedong. Under his leadership, China has always held high the banner of revolution and has become an example for all oppressed peoples in the world to strive for liberation. When I turn on the radio, the revolutionary voice from Beijing Radio is the most powerful, the most thorough in opposing imperialism, and the most supportive of the struggles of the oppressed peoples. These revolutionary voices are stirring the hearts of people around the world."

"The Selected Works of Mao Zedong" are the most popular books in some bookstores in Algiers. A bookstore worker said: "We have long known that the new leadership of the Soviet Communist Party is no longer revolutionary. Now Mao Zedong is holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism revolution, so his works are the most popular. Some readers come to the bookstore and buy twenty or thirty single-volume works of Chairman Mao. A customer from Constantine, named Mezari, happily bought the first and fourth volumes of "The Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (French edition). He said: "I have read many revolutionary books. I find that Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest thought, and Chairman Mao is the great mentor of the contemporary Marxist-Leninist movement. Mao Zedong Thought plays a huge role in the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. All revolutionaries must study Mao Zedong Thought."

    毛泽东的声音激动着全世界人民的心
    阿尔及利亚人民热爱毛主席的革命理论勤学毛主席著作
    据新华社阿尔及尔二十四日电　阿尔及利亚工人、农民老游击战士、青年学生和其他阶层人士，最近在同记者谈话时，热烈称颂毛泽东主席“是世界人民的领袖”，表示要认真学习毛泽东思想。
    一位名叫迈贾尼的老游击战士说：“在阿尔及利亚解放战争初期，我们就知道了毛泽东。是他，告诉我们怎样打击敌人，怎样争取解放。中国兄弟给了我们无私的援助，其中最珍贵的援助是毛泽东的革命理论。毛泽东是世界人民的领袖，是世界上最伟大的革命英雄。他为中国人民服务，也为全世界人民服务。”
    阿尔及尔的一位老工人本托尔巴说：“我读毛泽东的书，感到他始终为人民说话。毛泽东说帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，这是完全正确的。”
    阿尔及尔郊区的一位农民马祖格最近观看了中国影片《大寨田》。他说：“你们沿着毛泽东提出的自力更生的道路前进，你们的农民生活得很幸福。毛泽东和工农在一起，了解工农的心，关心人民的生活，是最好的领袖。”
    有些青年一面学习毛主席著作，一面做学习笔记，还把毛主席语录写在带在身边的小本子上。有位大学生读了毛主席的哲学著作，写了好几页学习笔记。
    一位新闻工作者塞马尔说道：“我认为毛泽东是世界革命的天才领袖。在当代历史上，找不出像毛泽东这样一位杰出领袖。在他领导下的中国，一直高举着革命旗帜，成了全世界被压迫人民谋求解放的榜样。我打开收音机，听到北京电台的革命声音是最有力量，最彻底反帝，最支持被压迫人民斗争的声音。这些革命的声音，激动着全世界人民的心。”
    《毛泽东选集》在阿尔及尔一些书店里是最受人们欢迎的书。一位书店工作人员说：我们早已知道苏共新领导集团已经不革命了。现在毛泽东高举着马列主义革命旗帜，所以他的著作最受欢迎。有些读者来一次书店，就买二三十本毛主席著作单行本。一位来自君士坦丁的名叫梅扎里的顾客，满意地买到了《毛泽东选集》第一卷和第四卷（法文版）。他说：“我读过很多革命书籍。我发现毛泽东思想是最伟大的思想，毛主席是当代马列主义运动的伟大导师。毛泽东思想对于中国革命和世界革命都起着巨大的作用。一切革命者，都必须学习毛泽东思想。”
