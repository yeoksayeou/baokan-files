The second volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong in Arabic has recently been published in Syria.

A statement by the Damascus Publishing House says: "The thoughts of Chairman Mao Zedong are the correct revolutionary theory, which has realized the combination of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese revolutionary practice. When the revolutionary forces of China took this theory as their guiding light and compass, the Chinese revolution became a great revolution, paving the way for the Chinese people to achieve great victories in eliminating imperialism, feudalism, and building socialism. The Chinese people have established a strong bastion for the world's progressive movement and the anti-imperialist struggle of the colonized and oppressed peoples."

The statement says: "When Chairman Mao Zedong applied Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution, he provided the world's revolutionary fighters with the sharpest weapon for their struggle against imperialism, reactionaries, and for the liberation of their nations, socialism, and the dignity of the people." Previously, the first and fourth volumes of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong in Arabic have been published in Damascus and Beirut.

    《出版者的话》指出这是全世界革命战士最锐利的武器
    新华社大马士革四日电　《毛泽东选集》第二卷阿拉伯文版最近在叙利亚出版。
    大马士革出版公司写的一篇《出版者的话》说：“毛泽东主席的思想是正确的革命理论，它实现了马克思列宁主义同中国革命实践的结合。当中国革命力量把这一理论作为指路明灯和指南的时候，中国革命就成了伟大的革命，为中国人民取得消灭殖民主义、封建主义和建设社会主义的伟大胜利铺平道路。中国人民为世界进步运动以及殖民地和被统治人民的反殖民主义斗争建立了强大的堡垒。”
    《出版者的话》说：“当毛泽东主席把马克思列宁主义运用于中国革命的时候，他就给了全世界革命战士为反对殖民主义、反动派，和为争取民族解放、社会主义和人民尊严而进行的斗争以最锐利的武器。”在此以前《毛泽东选集》第一卷和第四卷的阿拉伯文版已经在大马士革和贝鲁特出版。
