A large number of Japanese youth representatives gathered in front of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 24th, braving the rain to continue protesting the Sato government's sabotage of Sino-Japanese friendly exchanges and its following of the United States in intensifying anti-China actions. They demanded that visas be issued to allow them to go to Beijing as soon as possible to participate in the second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering.

The brave and tenacious Japanese youth sang the "Internationale" and "Tokyo-Beijing" songs in the pouring rain.

Japanese Socialist Party parliamentarian Oshiba Shigeo addressed the gathering Japanese youth, encouraging them to persist in their struggle. He emphasized that the Japanese government has no reason to refuse to issue visas.

On the evening of the 23rd, more than 200 Japanese youth held a grand meeting at the Tokyo Socialist Party headquarters' cultural hall. The meeting read a statement from the China-Japan Friendship Association, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation, condemning the Sato government's obstruction of Japanese youth coming to China for the grand gathering. They also read a telegram of support from Japanese youth friends in China for the struggle of Japanese youth to obtain visas. The entire audience responded with enthusiastic applause. Everyone resolutely declared that they would strengthen unity, persist in the struggle, and strive for victory so that they could reunite with their Chinese friends as soon as possible.
