	In the North China Plain, in the Beijing Military Region, the heroic deeds of a soldier are now being widely praised. This soldier is He Xiangkui. He showed the greatest bravery in extinguishing a mountain fire and displayed extraordinary strength and fortitude during his recovery in the hospital. Recently, the Beijing Military Region held a conference for active learners and appliers of Chairman Mao's works. After listening to his report on his experiences in learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, people were moved to say that He Xiangkui's deeds once again prove that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, fearless of death, and possess the greatest fighting spirit.

	He Xiangkui is a soldier in a reconnaissance company of a certain unit. He is the son of a poor peasant and a member of the Communist Party. In the spring of 1965, he enlisted from a village in Hebei Province. In this great school of Mao Zedong Thought that is the People's Liberation Army, he diligently studies Chairman Mao's books, strictly follows Chairman Mao's instructions, and fights hard against selfish thoughts and ideas, eliminating bourgeois elements and promoting proletarian elements. He said that he has learned the most from the "Three Articles," remembers the most about "completely" and "thoroughly," and applies the most "serving the public." His action slogan is: learn a little, do a little, learn and do, no empty talk. Therefore, in the short time since his enlistment, he has become a strong soldier, always taking the lead and creating many moving deeds. His heroic actions in extinguishing the mountain fire are a prime example.

	On February 7 of this year, He Xiangkui went with his unit to practice shooting. On the way, they encountered a mountain fire. The burning area was very close to the village. At that time, there was a level five wind, and the raging fire was getting bigger and bigger, seriously threatening the lives and property of the people. He Xiangkui rushed to the most dangerous place to fight against the flames.

	At this moment, He Xiangkui remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "To struggle means to make sacrifices, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the suffering of the majority of the people. To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai." Like his comrades, he did not wait for the commander's order but rushed up the mountain where the fire started. He ran at the very front, searching for fire-fighting tools along the way. In front of him was a dry river valley, with nothing but stones and gravel. What if there were no fire-fighting tools? This soldier, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and with a proletarian worldview of living for revolution and dying for revolution, paid no attention to it and continued to run forward. Running and running, he picked up a straw bag, and with this sole tool, he charged into the sea of fire.

	The fire on the mountain was fierce in some places and weak in others. He thought: the places where the fire is small and easy to extinguish should be left for the comrades behind to save, and he should go to the most dangerous places. He immediately rushed through the thick smoke, climbed up the hill, and charged into the raging fire. Flames several feet high rushed towards him, and he swung the straw bag left and right to beat them down. As he swung, the straw bag burned up, and he prepared to take off his cotton jacket to beat down the fire. But as he raised his hand, a sharp pain shot through his heart—his hand was burned. The fire was closing in on him. His clothes were burned, his eyebrows were singed, the thick smoke choked him so he couldn't breathe, and the smoke stung his eyes so he couldn't open them. At that moment, not far away, there was an upwind area with no fire. If he rushed out, he could escape to safety. But he did not do so. He remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai," and he thought of the heroic images of Qiu Shaoyun and Wang Jie facing danger without fear. He decided to follow Chairman Mao's words, learn from the heroes, and be willing to die for the people. With unparalleled courage and unparalleled strength, he threw himself onto the slope where the fire was the fiercest, rolling and rolling, fighting against the raging fire. He rolled from here to there, extinguishing one large fire after another. Later, he rolled to a place where there was a lot of grass and the fire was particularly fierce. He thought: this place must be extinguished first; otherwise, the fire will spread even faster in all directions. He tried to stand up to call everyone to come here, but darkness overcame him, and he knew nothing more.

	When his comrades extinguished the fire on his body and carried him, he opened his eyes and said, "Don't mind me, go and put out the fire." Then, he struggled to get up and continue the fire-fighting battle. His injuries were too severe, and he immediately fainted. In his fainted state, whenever he regained consciousness a little, he would shout, "Quick, help me put out the fire." When his comrades told him that the villagers had come and the mountain fire had been extinguished, he finally relaxed.

	He Xiangkui's injuries were severe, with 90% of his body burned. Of this, 35% was second-degree burns, and 55% was third-degree burns. His pulse was abnormally weak, his blood pressure was unmeasurable, and his life was in danger. On the third day of his hospitalization, after barely surviving the "shock" phase, he regained consciousness and thought: fighting against the mountain fire relied on Mao Zedong Thought, and now fighting against the pain also relies on Mao Zedong Thought. At this time, severe burns combined with edema made his body unable to move, his hands unable to lift, and his eyes unable to open. Unable to study by himself, he asked the doctor to read Chairman Mao's quotations to him. The duty doctor leaned over the bed and softly read to him:

	"In times of difficulty, our comrades should see achievements, see light, and raise our courage."

	Chairman Mao's words deeply moved He Xiangkui. He struggled to open his eyes and said, "Doctor, let me see Chairman Mao's words with my own eyes." The duty doctor, fearing that the small characters would be hard to see, wrote the quotations on a large piece of paper and placed them in front of his eyes. He was overjoyed and read them one by one, feeling more and more energetic.

	Because of the need for treatment, he lay face down on the bed all day, his body in pain, but he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and did not utter a word of suffering or cry out in pain, always persevering. One day, the duty nurse Yang Guilan was reading "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong," and he heard the sound of turning pages and asked:

	"Nurse Yang, what are you reading?"

	The nurse said, "Studying 'In Memory of Norman Bethune.'"

	He said, "Let's study together, shall we?"

	She explained, "You are not comfortable lying face down. Let's wait until you turn over to study, okay?"

	He thought: other things can wait, but studying Chairman Mao's works cannot wait! So he said, "It's okay, just read loudly, let me hear what Chairman Mao says again." Yang Guilan read, "Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and dedication is shown in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." The words "extreme" kept echoing in his mind, and he thought: Chairman Mao's instructions, I must carry them out resolutely, whether in the company or in the hospital, and no matter what work I do, I must achieve two "extremes."

	During this period, he often thought about this question: the injuries are so severe, when will they heal? Will I be able to return to the company when I am healed? Thinking and thinking, he felt something was wrong, and he studied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, gradually realizing that even in recovery, one should not have selfish thoughts, and even in the hospital, one should reform one's worldview. He set a requirement for himself: endure the pain, cooperate with the treatment, and recover for the revolution! On the sickbed, he insisted on studying every day. If his hands couldn't hold the book, he would read with his mouth; if his mouth couldn't read, he would listen with his ears. As his condition improved, he often held study sessions with medical staff in the ward, sharing his thoughts and discussing his gains.

	During the treatment process, changing dressings was the most painful part, initially requiring six or seven changes a day. He Xiangkui showed extraordinary strength in the face of pain, never uttering a word of suffering, and instead thought of Chairman Mao's teachings on "mutual concern, mutual love, and mutual help," feeling that it was not enough to just not complain or cry out in pain. He should also show concern, love, and help to the doctors and nurses in the treatment. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, he made up his mind: the more painful it is, the more he should insist on singing revolutionary songs, telling revolutionary stories, sometimes even guessing riddles with the doctors, cooperating with each other and encouraging each other, and the hearts of the class brothers were even more closely connected.

	One day, during a dressing change, the doctors held a consultation, prolonging the time, and he could no longer bear the pain. He sang loudly, "The great sea voyage relies on the helmsman," followed by "The proletarian is a man of iron," and the more he sang, the more he felt his body lighten. He said, "As long as we listen to Chairman Mao's words, we can overcome any difficulty."

	As his health recovered, starting in May, he began functional exercises, first practicing joint movements, then sitting, standing, and walking. Each exercise, each type of exercise, he had to endure great pain, but he never forgot Chairman Mao's teachings and persevered. Now, he has practiced to the point where he can walk more than a thousand meters on flat ground. As long as the heart beats, bravely participate in the class struggle

	Spirit unbroken, forever revolutionary. During his recovery, he also actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's discussions on class and class struggle, wrote articles criticizing the anti-party crimes of the Deng Tuo clique, and at that time, his hands could not turn pages, so he used his tongue to lick them; he could not hold a pen to write articles, so he asked others to write for him. He said: although I am on the sickbed and cannot participate in face-to-face struggles, I will use the second life given to me by Mao Zedong Thought to participate in this unprecedented class struggle. As long as my heart is beating, I will bravely fight to the end!

	The leadership of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Military Region decided to award this good soldier of Chairman Mao the first-class merit citation and called on all officers and soldiers to learn from him. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also issued a notice, calling on all revolutionary cadres, Communist Party members, and the people of the entire province to learn from his selfless, fearless, and revolutionary spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, and to truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

	During the Beijing Military Region Conference for Active Learners and Appliers of Chairman Mao's Works, after reading the People's Daily editorial "Salute to Our Red Guards," He Xiangkui was deeply moved. He wrote with his injured hand: Follow Chairman Mao's words, care about state affairs, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    赴汤蹈火为人民
    ——记活学活用毛主席著作积极分子贺相魁在扑灭山火和治伤期间的英雄事迹
    在华北平原上，在北京部队里，如今到处传颂着一个英雄战士的动人事迹。这个战士叫贺相魁。他在扑灭一次山火中表现得最勇敢，在医院治伤时，又显得坚强不屈，毅力超人。最近，北京部队举行学习毛主席著作积极分子大会，人们听他介绍了活学活用毛主席著作的经验以后，激动地说，贺相魁的事迹，再一次证明了毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢，不怕死，是最大的战斗力。
    贺相魁是某部特务连的战士，贫农的儿子，共产党员，一九六五年春天从河北农村入伍。他在解放军这个毛泽东思想的大学校里，刻苦读毛主席的书，严格按毛主席的指示办事，狠斗私心杂念，灭资兴无。他说他学毛主席著作，学得最多的是“老三篇”，记得最牢的是“完全”“彻底”，用得较好的是一心为公。他的行动口号是：学一点，做一点，学到做到，不放空炮。因此，在入伍后短短的时间里，他就成了一个坚强的战士，处处走在前，干在先，创造出许多动人的事迹。他在扑灭山火中的英雄行为就是其中的一例。
    今年二月七日，贺相魁随部队去打靶，半路上碰上山火，着火的地方离村庄很近。当时刮着五级大风，熊熊的大火越烧越大，人民的生命财产受着严重威胁。到最危险的地方与烈火展开搏斗
    这时，贺相魁想起了毛主席的教导：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”他和战友们一样，没等指挥员的命令，就朝起火的山上奔去。他一直跑在最前头，边跑边搜寻灭火的工具。眼前是一片干涸的河谷，除了石头就是沙砾。没有灭火工具怎么办？这位在毛泽东思想哺育下树立了生为革命生、死为革命死的无产阶级人生观的战士，毫不在意，继续向前猛跑。跑着跑着，拾到一个草袋子，他拿着这唯一的工具冲进了火海。
    山上有的地方火势小，有的地方火势猛。他想：应该把火小容易扑灭的地方留给后面的同志去救，自己要到最危险的地方去。他立即穿过浓烟，爬上高坡，冲进熊熊大火之中。几尺高的火苗向他扑来，他拿着草袋子左右奋力扑打。打着打着，草袋子快烧完了，他准备脱下棉衣，用衣服扑打，那知一抬手，一阵揪心的疼痛，他的手烧伤了。火，正在包围着他。衣服烧了，眉毛燎焦了，浓烟呛得他喘不过气，熏得他睁不开眼。这时，不远的地方有个上风口，没有火，向外一冲就可以躲到安全的地方。他没有这样做，他又想起毛主席的教导：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”，想起了邱少云、王杰临危不惧的英雄形象，他决心听毛主席的话，向英雄们学习，为人民粉身碎骨心甘情愿。他以无比的勇敢，无比的坚强，全身扑倒在火势最旺的草坡上，滚呀滚呀，与烈火展开了搏斗。他从这里滚到那里，压灭了一块大火又一块大火。后来，他滚到一块草特多，火特别旺的地方，心想：这里非先扑灭不可，不然大火会更快地向四面八方蔓延。他想站起来喊大家到这里来，那知眼前一黑，就什么也不知道了。
    当同志们把这位英雄战士身上的火扑灭，在抬他的时候，他睁开了眼，第一句就说：“不用管我，快去救火。”接着，又挣扎着起来，要继续投入灭火战斗。他的伤太重了，立即昏了过去。昏迷中，稍一清醒，他就喊：“快扶我去救火。”当战友告诉他，老乡们都来了，山火扑灭了，他才放了心。
    贺相魁的伤很重，全身烧伤面积达百分之九十。其中深二度烧伤占百分之三十五，三度烧伤占百分之五十五。脉搏跳动异常微弱，血压已经量不到了，生命处在垂危中。住院第三天，刚刚度过“休克”关，他稍一清醒就想：与山火斗，靠的是毛泽东思想，现在与伤痛斗，也要靠毛泽东思想。这时，严重烧伤加上水肿，使他身体不能动，两手不能抬，眼睛睁不开。自己不能学，他就请求医生给他读毛主席语录。值班医生俯在床前，轻声给他念道：
    “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    毛主席的话句句打动贺相魁的心。他勉强睁开眼，要求说：“医生，让我亲眼看看毛主席的话吧。”值班医生怕字小看得费力，就把语录抄在一张大纸上，送到他的眼前，他高兴得一个字一个字的念，越念浑身越有力量。为革命养伤战胜难忍的疼痛
    因为治疗的需要，他整天俯卧在病床上，浑身疼痛，但他牢记毛主席的教导，不说一个苦字，不叫一声痛，始终坚持着。一天，值班护士杨桂兰在读《毛泽东著作选读》，他听到书页的掀动声，忙问道：
    “杨护士，你看什么？”
    护士说：“学习《纪念白求恩》。”
    他说：“咱们一块儿学吧？”
    她解释说：“你俯卧不舒服，等一会翻过身来再学好不好？”
    他想：别的事情能等，学习毛主席著作，可不能等呀！就说：“不怕，你大声念吧，让我再听听毛主席咋说的？”杨桂兰念道：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”“极端”两个字，又在他脑子里翻腾起来，他想：毛主席的指示，我要坚决照办，不论在连队还是在医院，也不论是干什么工作，都应做到两个“极端”。
    这期间，他经常想这样一个问题：伤势这么重，啥时能好？好了还能回连队吗？想着想着，觉得不对头，他又带着问题学毛主席著作，渐渐认识到，养伤也不能有私心杂念，住院也要改造世界观。他给自己提出了一个要求：忍受伤痛，配合治疗，为革命而养伤！在病床上，他坚持天天读，手不能拿，就用嘴念；嘴不能念，就用眼看；眼不能看，就用耳听。随着伤情的好转，他还常和医护人员在病房开讲用会，一起亮思想，一块谈收获。
    治疗过程中，换药是最疼的一关，最初每天要换六七次。贺相魁在疼痛面前，一直表现出坚强不屈，从不叫一声苦，相反的他想起了毛主席关于“互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，觉得光是不叫苦、不喊痛不行，还应该在治疗上给医生和护士同志们以关心、爱护和帮助。他遵照毛主席的教导，下定决心：越是疼痛，越坚持唱革命歌曲，讲革命故事，有时还和医生们猜字谜，互相配合，互相鼓舞，阶级兄弟的心连得更紧了。
    有一天换药，医生们进行会诊，拖长了时间，他痛得实在忍不住了，就放声唱起了《大海航行靠舵手》，接着又唱《工人阶级硬骨头》，越唱他越觉得浑身轻松。他说：“只要听毛主席的话，天大的困难也能克服。”
    随着健康的恢复，从五月份起，他开始了功能锻炼，先练关节活动，再练坐、立、走。每一次锻炼，每一种锻炼，他都要忍受极大的痛苦，但是他一刻也不忘毛主席的教导，始终坚持不懈。如今，他已经练得能在平地上走一千多米了。只要心在跳动就勇敢参加阶级斗争
    身残志不残，永远干革命。他在养伤期间，还积极参加了无产阶级文化大革命，他反复学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，写文章批判邓拓黑帮反党罪行。当时，他的手不能翻书，就用舌头舔着翻；不能拿笔写文章，就请人代写。他说：我虽然身在病床，不能参加面对面的斗争，但我要用毛泽东思想给我的第二次生命，参加这场史无前例的阶级斗争，只要我的心在跳动，我就要勇敢战斗，斗争到底！
    人民解放军北京部队领导机关为了表彰这位毛主席的好战士的高贵品质，决定给他记一等功，并号召全体指战员向他学习。中共河北省委也发出通知，号召全体革命干部、共产党员和全省人民，学习他公而忘私，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民的崇高精神，把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
