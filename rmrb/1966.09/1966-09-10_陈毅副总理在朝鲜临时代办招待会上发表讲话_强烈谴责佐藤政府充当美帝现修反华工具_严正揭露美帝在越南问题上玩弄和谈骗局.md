Vice Premier Chen Yi, at a reception hosted by the Chargé d'Affaires of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, strongly condemned the Sato government for acting as a tool of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism against China. He also sternly exposed the U.S. imperialists' deception in the Vietnam issue.

The U.S. imperialists are nothing to be afraid of, modern revisionists are nothing to be afraid of, and adding a Japanese reactionary is still nothing to be afraid of. The Sato government's obstinate actions will only lead them into the abyss of disaster.

The Vietnamese people will fight to the end without any possibility of midway compromise. To achieve peace, the U.S. aggressors must immediately, completely, and cleanly get out of Vietnam. Otherwise, all talk of peace negotiations is just deceitful rhetoric.

New China News Agency, September 9th: Vice Premier Chen Yi tonight strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for its frenzied revival of Japanese militarism, pointing out that the Sato government is wholeheartedly aiming to become a member of the new holy alliance of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism in Asia, plotting against China. He said that the Sato government's obstinate actions will only lead them into the abyss of disaster.

Vice Premier Chen Yi also condemned U.S. imperialism for playing tricks with peace talks while escalating the aggression in Vietnam. He said that the Vietnamese people will fight to the end without any possibility of midway compromise. To achieve peace, the U.S. aggressors must immediately, completely, and cleanly get out of Vietnam. Otherwise, all talk of peace negotiations is just deceitful rhetoric.

Vice Premier Chen Yi made these remarks at a reception hosted by the Chargé d'Affaires of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Jae-suk, at the Korean Embassy in China tonight.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, U.S. imperialism is frantically reviving Japanese militarism, suppressing the Japanese people, and invading Asian countries. The Sato government is the most reactionary government in Japan since the Second World War. It has increasingly become a docile tool of U.S. imperialism. The Sato government signed the so-called "Japan-South Korea Treaty" with the Pak Chung-hee clique, enslaving the South Korean people and threatening the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Sato government wholeheartedly aims to become a member of the new holy alliance of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism in Asia, plotting against China. The Chinese people, together with the Korean people, resolutely oppose the criminal activities of the Japanese reactionaries led by Sato.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, we must warn the Sato government: we are not afraid of your tricks; U.S. imperialism is nothing to be afraid of, modern revisionists are nothing to be afraid of, and adding a Japanese reactionary is still nothing to be afraid of. The Sato government's obstinate actions will only lead them into the abyss of disaster.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, the heroic Vietnamese people have already fought the U.S. aggressors to a standstill on the battlefield in Vietnam. While escalating and expanding the aggression in Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is constantly playing tricks with peace talks. More and more countries in the world have seen through the fact that the so-called peace talks by the U.S. are just a means to maintain the interests of the U.S. aggressors. The Chinese people resolutely support the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call. The Vietnamese people will fight to the end without any possibility of midway compromise. To achieve peace, the U.S. aggressors must immediately, completely, and cleanly get out of Vietnam. Otherwise, all talk of peace negotiations is just deceitful rhetoric. Seven hundred million Chinese people are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and resolutely support the heroic Vietnamese people to carry the sacred war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, when talking about the current revolutionary situation in the world, said, modern revisionists have betrayed Marxism-Leninism. They say that Marxism-Leninism is outdated. They advocate peaceful coexistence with imperialism. They strive to push forward a counter-revolutionary policy of cooperating with the U.S. to jointly dominate the world. They have become the accomplices and pillars of U.S. imperialism in executing its policy of aggression and war worldwide. Therefore, to oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism. All true revolutionaries must draw a clear line with modern revisionism, resolutely expose their traitorous faces, and under no circumstances engage in any "joint actions" with them.

    陈毅副总理在朝鲜临时代办招待会上发表讲话
    强烈谴责佐藤政府充当美帝现修反华工具
    严正揭露美帝在越南问题上玩弄和谈骗局
    美帝国主义没有什么了不起，现代修正主义没有什么了不起，再加上一个日本反动派也没有什么了不起。佐藤政府如此一意孤行，只能把自己带进灾难深渊。
    越南人民只有打到底，没有中途妥协的可能。要和平，只有美国侵略者立即全部、彻底、干净滚出越南，否则，一切关于和平谈判的议论，都是骗人的空话。
    新华社九日讯　陈毅副总理今晚强烈谴责美帝国主义疯狂复活日本军国主义，指出佐藤政府是一心一意想充当美帝国主义和现代修正主义在亚洲策划的反华的新神圣同盟的一员。他说，佐藤政府一意孤行，只能把他们自己带进灾难的深渊。
    陈毅副总理还谴责美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，不断玩弄和谈骗局。他说，越南人民只有打到底，没有中途妥协的可能。要和平，只有美国侵略者立即全部、彻底、干净滚出越南，否则，一切关于和平谈判的议论，都是骗人的空话。
    陈毅副总理是在今晚朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办金在淑举行的招待会上讲这些话的。
    陈毅副总理说，美帝国主义正在疯狂地复活日本军国主义，镇压日本人民，侵略亚洲国家。佐藤政府是第二次世界大战以来日本最反动的一届政府。它已日益成为美帝国主义手中的驯服工具。佐藤政府同朴正熙集团签订所谓“日韩条约”，奴役南朝鲜人民，威胁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。佐藤政府一心一意想充当美帝国主义和现代修正主义在亚洲策划的反华的新神圣同盟的一员。中国人民和朝鲜人民一道，坚决反对以佐藤为首的日本反动派的罪恶活动。
    陈毅副总理说，我们要警告佐藤政府：我们决不害怕你们这一套；美帝国主义没有什么了不起，现代修正主义没有什么了不起，再加上一个日本反动派也没有什么了不起。佐藤政府如此一意孤行，只能把他们自己带进灾难的深渊。
    陈毅副总理说，英雄的越南人民，已经在越南战场上把美国侵略者打得走投无路。美帝国主义在加紧和扩大侵略越南战争的同时，不断玩弄和谈骗局。世界上越来越多的国家，看清楚了美国的所谓和谈，只是维护美国侵略者既得利益的一种手段。中国人民坚决支持越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的号召书。越南人民只有打到底，没有中途妥协的可能。要和平，只有美国侵略者立即全部、彻底、干净滚出越南，否则，一切关于和平谈判的议论，都是骗人的空话。七亿中国人民，决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，坚决支持英雄的越南人民，把神圣的抗美救国战争进行到底。
    陈毅副总理在谈到当前全世界一派大好革命形势时说，现代修正主义背叛了马克思列宁主义，他们说马克思列宁主义已经过时。他们主张同帝国主义和平共处。他们竭力推行同美国合作来共同主宰世界的反革命政策。他们已经成为美帝国主义在全世界执行侵略政策和战争政策的帮凶和支柱。因此，要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。一切真正的革命者必须同现代修正主义划清界限，坚决揭露他们的工贼面目，决不能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。
