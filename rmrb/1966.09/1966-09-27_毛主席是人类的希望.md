I am a farm worker, 44 years old, and I have been imprisoned by Franco. My brother was also killed by the Falange.

I want to tell you that I have read many books by the great Comrade Mao Zedong. In my home, there is a photograph of Comrade Mao Zedong. During your War of Liberation, I was very sympathetic to you. When I read reports about General Lin Biao and saw his picture, I was very excited. Comrades, I really want to visit People's China to see everything that the great Comrade Mao Zedong has built. I will buy all the books that talk about China. We trust you. Mao Zedong has many soldiers all over the world. This is also the case in Spain. I sincerely salute all the people of China. I wish Comrade Mao Zedong eternal life.

Comrade, I am writing this letter on behalf of many comrades.

Enclosed is a colorful picture with a red rose. Great Comrade Mao Zedong, please accept this red rose picked for you. Mao Zedong is the hope of mankind. When we mention Mao Zedong, we mean the Lenin of our time.

Spanish farm worker, Kēlǔnuòduō

    毛主席是人类的希望
    我是一个农业工人，今年四十四岁，曾经被佛朗哥监禁过，我的兄弟也遭过长枪党的毒手。
    我要告诉你们，我读过伟大的毛泽东同志的许多书。在我的家里，有毛泽东同志的照片。早在你们解放战争期间，我就非常同情你们。当我读到有关林彪将军的报道和看到他的像片的时候，心情是非常激动的。同志们，我非常想访问人民中国，去看看伟大的毛泽东同志所建设的一切。所有谈及中国的书籍，我都要购买。我们信赖你们。毛泽东在全世界有很多战士。在西班牙也是如此。我向全体中国人民衷心地致意。祝毛泽东同志万寿无疆。
    同志，我是以许多同志的名义给你们写信的。
    随信寄上一张印有红玫瑰的彩色画片。伟大的毛泽东同志，请接受为您采摘的这朵红玫瑰。毛泽东是人类的希望。当我们提到毛泽东的时候就指的是当代的列宁。
