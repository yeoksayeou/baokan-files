From August 20 to 30, the Viet Cong guerrillas in Gia Lai Province fought bravely along the 19th Highway, blowing up eight enemy military trucks and eliminating 45 South Korean mercenary soldiers.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the Viet Cong guerrillas in South Vietnam have been mobile and flexible, striking the enemy everywhere, recently eliminating a large number of American and puppet troops.

On August 19, the Viet Cong guerrillas in Binh Dinh Province attacked the residence of puppet government officials in Phu My County, eliminating 40 bandits.

On the night of August 17, the Viet Cong guerrillas in Ninh Thuan Province blew up five oil pipelines from Ninh Chieu to Ta Station.

Additionally, the Viet Cong guerrillas in Cha Ron, Quang Nam, Tra Vinh, Tu Du, and Phu Yen provinces have also been very active, attacking enemy strongholds, ambushing enemy vehicles, infiltrating "strategic hamlets" to capture bandits, and blowing up bridges, causing the enemy to be in a state of chaos and suffering heavy losses.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, on the night of August 17, the liberation armed forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh region launched a fierce artillery barrage on an enemy logistics base near the Tan Son Nhut Airport.

The liberation forces' artillery accurately struck the enemy's parking lot, turning it into a sea of fire, destroying more than 100 enemy vehicles and killing and wounding over 80 American invaders, puppet soldiers, and New Zealand technical personnel.

The Viet Cong guerrillas and local people in a certain area in central Vietnam have launched a sabotage campaign, cutting off the enemy's land supply lines, leaving the enemy isolated and helpless.
