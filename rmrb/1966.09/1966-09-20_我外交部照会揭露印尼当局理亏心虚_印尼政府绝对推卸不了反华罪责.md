    The Chinese Foreign Ministry on September 19 exposed the Indonesian government's guilt and cowardice in its handling of the Chinese Embassy's protest against the Indonesian authorities' summoning and expulsion of Chinese school principals.

    New China News Agency, September 19: The Chinese Foreign Ministry on September 19 sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China regarding the Indonesian government's unreasonable "return" of the Chinese Embassy's September 1 protest note against the Indonesian authorities' summoning and expulsion of Chinese school principals.

    The note pointed out: The Indonesian government attempts to cover up its anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese policies by "returning the note," and wants the Chinese government not to expose or protest, which is absolutely impossible.

    The note said: On September 1, 1966, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, protesting the serious persecution of Chinese school principals in West Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan since late June this year. The Chinese Embassy's note listed numerous facts of persecution against Chinese schools, exposed the Indonesian government's anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese atrocities, and made reasonable demands. The Indonesian government cannot deny these ironclad facts and does not dare to face the Chinese government's solemn demands, claiming that "the note contains language that should not be in a diplomatic note" and returning the note to the Chinese Embassy. This is indeed rare in diplomatic history and is quite clumsy.

    The note said: This can only show that you are guilty and cowardly, afraid of facts, and do not reason. The Chinese government expresses deep regret over this.

    The note said: The Chinese government once again warns the Indonesian government that as long as you continue to pursue an anti-Chinese policy, we will not stop exposing and accusing you. Attempting to cover up your anti-Chinese crimes with the "returning the note" method and wanting us not to expose or protest is absolutely impossible.

    The note said: The Chinese government once again demands that the Indonesian government immediately stop anti-Chinese actions and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. The Chinese government reiterates that if the Indonesian government insists on its course, it will absolutely not be able to shirk the responsibility for the anti-Chinese measures it has taken.

    我外交部照会揭露印尼当局理亏心虚
    印尼政府绝对推卸不了反华罪责
    新华社十九日讯　中国外交部十九日就印度尼西亚政府无理“退回”中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆九月一日严重抗议印尼当局传讯和驱逐华侨学校校长的照会的事件，照会印尼驻华大使馆。
    照会指出：印尼政府企图用“退回照会”的办法来掩盖它的反华排华罪行，并且要中国政府不揭露、不抗议，这是绝对办不到的。
    照会说：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆一九六六年九月一日照会印度尼西亚外交部，就今年六月下旬以来，西爪哇、苏门答腊、加里曼丹等地移民厅传讯和驱逐上述地区华侨学校校长的严重迫害事件，向印度尼西亚政府提出严重抗议。中国大使馆的照会列举华侨学校受迫害的大量事实，揭露印度尼西亚政府反华排华的暴行，并且提出了合情合理的要求。印度尼西亚政府无法否认这些铁的事实，也不敢正视中国政府的严正要求，便说什么“因为含有外交照会中的确不应有的语句”，将该照会退回中国大使馆。这在外交关系史中实在是罕见的，也是十分拙劣的。
    照会说：这只能说明你们理亏心虚，害怕事实，不讲道理。中国政府对此表示十分遗憾。
    照会说：中国政府再次正告印度尼西亚政府，只要你们继续推行反华排华政策，我们绝不会停止对你们的揭露和控诉。企图用“退回照会”的办法来掩盖你们的反华排华罪行，要我们不揭露、不抗议，这是绝对办不到的。
    照会说：中国政府再次要求印度尼西亚政府立即停止反华排华行动，并保证不再发生类似事件。中国政府重申，如果印尼政府一意孤行，绝对推卸不了由于采取这些反华措施所应承担的全部责任。
