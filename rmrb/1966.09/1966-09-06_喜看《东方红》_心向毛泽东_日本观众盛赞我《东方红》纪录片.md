Japanese audiences' revolutionary spirits were stirred by the screening of the large-scale color documentary musical epic "The East Is Red" in Tokyo. They enthusiastically praised the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

A printer named Dazhen said, "The East Is Red' has shown me the great vitality of Chairman Mao's thoughts. Currently, hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Africa are studying Chairman Mao's works seriously and are effectively fighting against imperialists." He said, "Those who do not study the Chinese revolution seriously have no right to talk about revolution, and they will not be able to make a revolution."

A young man named Xiaochuan said, "I don't know of anyone in the world who can be as beloved by the people as Chairman Mao."

A 22-year-old worker named Shindeng wrote in the guest book after watching "The East Is Red": "In the world, the people who have walked the most arduous path are the Chinese people; in the world, the people who have conducted the most indomitable and heroic struggles are the Chinese people; in the world, the most great and wise people are the Chinese people; and today, the happiest people in the world are the Chinese people under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and the Communist Party of China."

    喜看《东方红》  心向毛泽东
    日本观众盛赞我《东方红》纪录片
    据新华社东京四日电　中国大型彩色纪录片音乐舞蹈史诗《东方红》在东京上映，激荡着日本观众的革命胸怀，他们热情赞颂中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。
    一位叫大前的印刷工人说：“《东方红》使我看到了毛主席思想的伟大生命力。目前在亚洲、非洲有几亿人民正在认真地学习毛主席的著作，同帝国主义者进行着有效的斗争。”他说，“谁不认真学习中国革命，谁就没有资格谈论革命，而且也不可能干革命”。
    一位名叫小川的青年说，“我不知道世界上还有什么人能够像毛主席这样深受人民的爱戴”。
    二十二岁的青年工人神田看了《东方红》后在留言簿上写道：“在世界上，走过了最艰苦的道路的人民是中国人民；在世界上进行过最不屈不挠的英勇斗争的人民是中国人民；在世界上最伟大聪明的人民是中国人民；而今在世界上最幸福的人民是在毛泽东思想和中国共产党领导下的中国人民”。
