“Long Live Chairman Mao!”

During Wang Yuchang's hospitalization, his wife Liu Shuxiu brought their son Dongzheng to visit him from their hometown. Wang Yuchang smiled and comforted her, saying, “Don’t be sad. Struggle means sacrifice. Some of our comrades who joined the army with us have already given their precious lives for the revolution. I am injured for the revolution; what is there to be sad about?”

He looked at Dongzheng standing by his side and said to his wife, “Not only do I do this, but we must also educate our children to do the same.” He asked Dongzheng, “Your teacher told you to learn from Comrade Lei Feng. How would Lei Feng handle this situation?”

Dongzheng replied, “Comrade Lei Feng would definitely do as Daddy does.”

Wang Yuchang smiled. Shuxiu remained silent, looking at his injured leg. Wang Yuchang continued, “Do you think it’s better for me to do this, or to just watch as our class brothers die in vain?”

Shuxiu quickly said, “Of course, it’s better to do this. But you are injured like this, how will you work in the future?”

Wang Yuchang said, “What’s there to be afraid of? If my right leg is disabled, I have my left leg. If my right hand is disabled, I have my left hand. Now, I can already write with my left hand. Look!” He picked up a pen and wrote a few characters with his left hand. Shuxiu took it and saw that the paper had the words “Long Live Chairman Mao!” written neatly.

“Long Live Chairman Mao!” These five shining words summed up everything Wang Yuchang wanted to say.

Always Remembering to Read Chairman Mao’s Books

When Wang Yuchang was a platoon leader, the soldiers in his platoon discovered a “secret”: he was very frugal, but why did his batteries run out so quickly? Later, they found the answer: he studied Chairman Mao’s works every night under his mosquito net, using a flashlight for light.

During his hospitalization, despite his severe injuries, Wang Yuchang never forgot to read Chairman Mao’s books. Every morning when he woke up, the first thing he did was to study Chairman Mao’s works. Since one of his hands was inconvenient, he used his tongue to turn the pages one by one. He also used his left hand to write notes. The first time he picked up a pen, he wrote “Long Live Chairman Mao!” He said, “Reading Chairman Mao’s books gives me boundless strength.” He used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against his injuries. When his condition was critical, he repeatedly read Chairman Mao’s letter to Comrade Wang Guanliang, overcoming the immense pain caused by his injuries.

Wang Yuchang, regardless of his position, day or night, busy or idle, would read Chairman Mao’s books whenever he had time. Since his cultural level was low, he bought a dictionary and studied while looking up words. He read through the first four volumes of “Selected Works of Mao Zedong,” and some articles he read countless times. Mao Zedong Thought illuminated his heart, making him prioritize revolution, work, and others; making him a good Party member and a good cadre.

Noble Morals and Revolutionary Family Traditions

Wang Yuchang’s fellow villagers highly praised his noble morals in handling marital relationships. Wang Yuchang’s marriage was arranged by his family in the old society. His wife was seven years older than him and had a lower level of education. After the nation’s victory, Wang Yuchang lived in big cities for a long time, and some people worried that he might be influenced by bourgeois ideology and “prefer new and discard old.” As it turned out, this worry was unnecessary. Wang Yuchang had the correct view on his marital issues. He believed: his wife was his class sister, a pure and simple working woman. In difficult times, she worked hard, managed the household, supported the frontline, and did some revolutionary work. Her age and education were different from his, which was a result of the old society and old system. He had no reason to despise her. Under this guidance, Wang Yuchang’s relationship with his wife was always good.

Wang Yuchang educated his children to be frugal and love labor. His daughter Wang Caiying wore a patched quilted jacket, which caused neighbors to comment. Someone said, “I heard that Caiying’s father is a cadre, why does he dress his child like a beggar?” When Wang Yuchang visited home, he heard these comments and said, “Now life is much better than in the old society! We must not forget the past hardships. Let the children experience some hardships from a young age, so they will have aspirations. What’s wrong with letting them wear old clothes for a few years?” Under Wang Yuchang’s education and influence, his children all performed well.

    王裕昌的故事
    “毛主席万岁！”
    在王裕昌住院期间，他爱人柳淑秀曾经带着儿子动正，从老家来探望他。王裕昌笑着安慰她说：“不要难过，要奋斗就会有牺牲，我们一起参军的同志，有的已经为革命献出了宝贵的生命，我为革命受一点伤，有什么难过的呢？”
    他看着站在一旁的动正，对爱人说：“不仅我这样做，也要教育孩子这样做。”他问动正：“老师告诉你们要学习雷锋叔叔，雷锋叔叔遇到这种情况，会怎样做呢？”
    动正回答说：“雷锋叔叔一定会像爸爸这样做。”
    王裕昌笑了。淑秀仍然看着他的伤腿不吭声。王裕昌又继续说：“你看我是这样做好，还是看着阶级兄弟白白地牺牲了好呢？”
    淑秀忙说：“当然是这样做好。可是你伤成这样，今后怎么工作呢？”
    王裕昌说：“这怕什么，右腿残废了有左腿，右手残废了有左手，现在，我已经能用左手写字了。你看！”说着，提起笔来用左手写了几个字。淑秀接过来一看，纸上端端正正写着：“毛主席万岁！”
    “毛主席万岁！”这五个闪闪发光的大字，概括了王裕昌心里要说的千言万语。
    念念不忘读毛主席的书
    王裕昌在当连长的时候，连里的战士发现了一个“秘密”：他平时最讲勤俭节约，可是电池为啥用得特别快呢？以后慢慢地找到了答案：原来他天天晚上躺在蚊帐里学习毛主席著作，就是用手电筒来照明。
    王裕昌住院期间，在伤情十分严重的情况下，还念念不忘读毛主席的书。他每天早晨一醒来，第一件事，就是学习毛主席著作。他一只手不方便，就用舌头一页一页地翻着读。还用左手一笔一笔地记心得笔记。他第一次拿起笔就写了“毛主席万岁”几个字。他说：“读了毛主席的书，会使我增添无穷的力量。”他就是以毛泽东思想为武器和伤病作斗争的。在病情危重时，他就反复地看毛主席给王观澜同志的信，克服了伤病给他带来的巨大痛苦。
    王裕昌不论在什么岗位上，不分白天黑夜，工作忙闲，有空就读毛主席的书。他文化水平低，就买了一本字典，边查字典边学习。他读完了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷，其中有些文章，读过无数遍。毛泽东思想照亮了他的心，使他能做到革命第一，工作第一，他人第一；使他成为一个好党员，好干部。
    崇高的品德革命的家风
    王裕昌的乡亲们非常称赞他在处理夫妻关系上的崇高品德。王裕昌的婚事，是在旧社会里家庭包办的。女方比他大七岁，文化水平也比他低。全国胜利后，王裕昌长期住大城市，有人担心他会受资产阶级思想意识的影响，会“喜新厌旧”。事实证明，这一担心是多余的。王裕昌对自己的婚姻问题有着正确的看法。他认为：女方是自己的阶级姐妹，是纯朴的劳动妇女。在艰苦的年代，她积极劳动，操持家务，支援前线，做了一些革命工作。她的年龄和文化与自己有些差别，这是旧社会、旧制度造成的。自己没有任何理由嫌弃她。在这种思想指导下，王裕昌和爱人的关系一直很好。
    王裕昌教育子女艰苦朴素、热爱劳动。他的小女儿王彩英穿着补了又补的棉袄，引起了邻居的议论。有人说：“听说小英他爹是个干部，怎么把孩子打扮成个叫花子样？”王裕昌探家时，知道了这些议论，他说：“现在生活比旧社会不知好了多少倍！咱可不能忘了过去的苦。孩子们从小多受点艰苦锻炼，长大了才能有志气，让他们穿几年破衣服，有什么不好？”在王裕昌的教育和影响下，他的孩子们表现都很好。
