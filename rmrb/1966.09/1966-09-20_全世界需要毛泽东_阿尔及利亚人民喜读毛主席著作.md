In the Chinese Pavilion at the Third Algerian International Trade Fair, Algerian audiences warmly welcomed the brilliant works of Chairman Mao, expressing deep affection and singing praises for Chairman Mao.

On the evening of the 16th, after the Chinese Pavilion opened, the reading room for Chairman Mao's works was packed with people. Some, holding newly purchased copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," came to request single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works. In just four hours, the audience requested a large number of single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works, and the number of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" purchased exceeded the total number ordered last year at the Chinese Pavilion.

An old warrior named Krim bought a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He said he had been reading Chairman Mao's books since the early days of the Algerian War of Independence. He said, "Mao Zedong is a true leader of the people. He lives forever among the masses, understands the hearts of the people the best, and knows the people's sufferings the best. His eyes, his thoughts, are always with the people. We revolutionary people love his books the most."

An old guerrilla fighter held more than ten single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works. He said he had been reading Chairman Mao's works for several years and was now studying Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction." He said, "I sleep one or two hours less at night to read Mao Zedong's books. Mao Zedong is dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly, and Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful. I believe that under the leadership of Mao Zedong, China is a true socialist country, while the Soviet Union is not a true socialist country."

Electrician Muhammad said, "Chairman Mao is the leader of the Chinese people and also the leader of the people of the world!"

A middle school teacher said, "We need Mao Zedong, the whole world needs Mao Zedong."

On the evening of the 16th, in the guest book at the Chinese Pavilion, 170 visitors wrote down their impressions. They expressed deep feelings, praising Chairman Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought. A driver wrote, "I, Said, a driver, want to shout long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live China!" (with picture)

    全世界需要毛泽东
    阿尔及利亚人民喜读毛主席著作
    据新华社阿尔及尔电　在第三届阿尔及尔国际博览会的中国馆，阿尔及利亚观众热烈地欢迎毛主席的光辉著作，满怀深情地歌颂毛主席。
    在十六日晚中国馆开放后，中国馆的毛泽东著作阅览室内挤满了人群。有的夹着刚买到的《毛泽东选集》，又来索取毛主席著作单行本。短短四小时内，观众就索取了大量毛主席著作单行本，购买的《毛泽东选集》的数目超过了人们去年在中国馆订购的总数。
    有位名叫克里姆的老战士买了一部《毛泽东选集》。他说，他早在阿尔及利亚解放战争初期就读毛主席的书。他说：“毛泽东是真正的人民领袖。他永远生活在人民群众之中，他最懂得群众的心，最了解群众的疾苦。他的眼睛，他的思想，是永远向着群众的。我们革命人民最喜爱他的书。”
    有一位老游击战士手里抱着十多本毛主席著作的单行本。他说，他读毛主席著作已有几年了，现在正在学习毛主席的《矛盾论》。他说：“我晚上少睡一、二小时，读毛泽东的书。毛泽东是全心全意为人民服务的，毛泽东思想是最有力量的。我认为在毛泽东领导下的中国是真正的社会主义，苏联不是真正的社会主义。”
    电器工人穆罕默德说：“毛主席是中国人民的领袖，也是世界人民的领袖！”
    有位中学教员说：“我们需要毛泽东，全世界需要毛泽东。”
    十六日晚，在中国馆的留言簿上，有一百七十位观众写下了他们的观感。他们以深厚的感情，歌颂毛泽东主席和毛泽东思想。一位司机写道：“我，赛义德，一个司机，我要喊毛泽东主席万岁！中国万岁！”（附图片）
