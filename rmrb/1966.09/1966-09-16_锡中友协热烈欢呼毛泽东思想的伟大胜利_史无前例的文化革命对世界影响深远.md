The Sino-Ceylonese Friendship Association passed a resolution at its annual meeting held in Colombo on September 13, joyfully hailing the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and warmly praising the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

The resolution on Mao Zedong Thought passed at the meeting said: "We wish our beloved leader, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese people, eternal life. His brilliant thought has pointed out the correct path for China to achieve great victories in revolution and construction, thus leading the Chinese people to build their motherland into a powerful socialist state in a very short historical period."

The resolution said: "Under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao and guided by his great thought, China has already become the strongest bulwark against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and the most reliable supporter of the world people's liberation struggle." The resolution said: "We are glad to see that more and more people are inspired by the great Mao Zedong Thought in their struggle for liberation and freedom, thus ensuring their victory and the final overthrow of all exploitative systems."

The resolution on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China passed at the meeting said:

"We joyfully hail the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is now sweeping across China like a storm. This is an unprecedented cultural revolution, which will undoubtedly have a profound impact on consolidating and developing China's political and economic revolutions, and will have a great and profound impact on the revolutionary struggles of the world's people."

The resolution pointed out: "The imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries are cursing and slandering this great movement of the awakened Chinese people precisely because this great movement will inevitably sweep away all the reactionary remnants of the superstructure of the old society, and they are pinning their hopes on these remnants for the appearance of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China."

The resolution "wishes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China a thorough victory."
