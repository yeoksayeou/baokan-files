	Looking at Chairman Mao's embroidered portrait,
	My heart has grown wings,
	Flying to the capital, Beijing,
	Flying into the Great Hall of the People.

	Chairman Mao, with a face full of spring, shakes hands with me,
	Speaks to me with a kind expression.
	Ah, Chairman Mao's words are like sweet dew,
	Dropping into my heart.

	Chairman Mao, you are the great savior of all ethnic peoples,
	Chairman Mao, you are the red sun of the revolutionary people of the world,
	The Daur people listen closely to your words,
	Striving towards the direction you point us.

	I hold Chairman Mao's golden book,
	My heart rises with a red sun,
	Illuminating my heart like a blazing fire,
	Making my heart bright and clear.

	I will work hard on my writing,
	Add strength to transform the world.
	Ah, through storms and tempests we will not lose our way,
	We dare to brave the knife mountain and fire sea.

	Chairman Mao, we firmly remember the class struggle,
	Chairman Mao, we will never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat.
	The Daur people listen closely to your words,
	Striving towards the communist paradise.

    达斡尔人民最听毛主席的话（歌词）
    “哈尔滨之夏”音乐会工农兵业余演出队
    望着毛主席的绣像，
    心儿插上了翅膀，
    飞到了首都北京城，
    飞进了人民大会堂。
    毛主席满面春风和我把手握，
    和颜悦色把话讲。
    啊，毛主席的话儿似甘露，
    点点滴进我心房。
    毛主席呀，您是各族人民的大救星，
    毛主席，您是世界革命人民的红太阳，
    达斡尔人民最听您的话，
    奔向您指引的方向。
    我手捧毛主席的金书，
    心里升起了红太阳，
    照得心里似火热，
    照得我心里亮堂堂。
    我要在用字上狠下功夫，
    改天换地添力量。
    啊，急风暴雨不迷路，
    刀山火海咱敢闯。
    毛主席呀，阶级斗争我们牢牢记，
    毛主席，无产阶级专政我们永不忘。
    达斡尔人民最听您的话，
    奔向共产主义天堂。
