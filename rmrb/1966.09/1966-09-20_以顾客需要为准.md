A new atmosphere fills the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Cloth Store (formerly Rui Fu Xiang Silk and Cloth Store) in Jinan. Hanging prominently in the center of the front wall is a portrait of Chairman Mao, and around the pillars are hung plaques with quotations from Chairman Mao. This fully demonstrates the revolutionary workers' boundless love, faith, and reverence for our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

Since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers have been studying Chairman Mao's works every day. In their studies, they have compared their management views and work styles, reformed old rules and regulations, and added new service items.

Now, when customers enter this cloth store, they can see service project signs at each counter. Customers can purchase various pre-cut items such as trousers, shoe uppers, fabric edges, collars, and patching cloth.

Not long ago, around noon, a young man in his twenties came to the counter of service staff member Liu Guilan. He wanted to buy one and a half meters of blue khaki fabric to patch his trousers. Liu Guilan measured the four areas that needed patching, calculated, and told him, "You don't need that much; one meter will be enough." She then cut four pieces of fabric of different sizes and handed them to him. This cloth store, to meet the diverse needs of customers, has expanded its fabric selection from the previous ten or so colors to over seventy, and the sizes, which previously had only three or four options, are now completely tailored to the customers' needs.

    以顾客需要为准
    在济南市工农兵布店（原瑞蚨祥绸缎店）里，充满着一片新气象。迎面墙中央，高挂着毛主席的画像，四周的柱子上悬挂着毛主席语录牌，充分显示出革命职工对我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。
    文化大革命运动以来，职工们每天坚持学习毛主席著作，他们在学习中，对照自己的经营观点和作风，改革了旧的规章制度，增添了新的服务项目。
    现在，当顾客走进这家布店的时候，就可以看到，在各个柜台上都设有为顾客服务的项目牌。顾客们可以在这儿买到不同的裁好了的便服裤腰、鞋面、布沿、领子、补钉布等等。
    不久前的一个中午，有个二十来岁的青年，来到服务员刘桂兰的柜台前，要买一尺半蓝卡其布补裤子。刘桂兰用尺子量了四个要补的地方，计算了一下，对他说：“用不了那么多，一尺就足够了。”说罢，裁了四块大小不同的布，交给了他。这家布店为满足顾客的不同需要，方寸布已由过去十几种花色布扩大到七十多种，尺码过去只有三四个，现在完全以顾客需要为准。
