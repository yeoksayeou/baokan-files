Munaim Khan both spoke at the banquet. In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said, since the launch of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some Western newspapers have been trying to defame and distort it. They are terrified of the Cultural Revolution. At this time, you have come to visit China and see for yourselves the situation of China's Cultural Revolution. You have praised our Cultural Revolution, which shows your respect for the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan. You are right. We appreciate and thank you for your friendly attitude. He said, you will be able to see that through the Cultural Revolution, our country will promote greater progress and development in industry, agriculture, science and technology, and national defense, which will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to strengthening world and Asian peace.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, the peoples of China and Pakistan should be friends forever. Our friendship can withstand any storms and waves.

A. Munaim Khan said in his speech, the friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China has a solid foundation and has withstood the test of difficulties. The Chinese people's support for the self-determination rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir has further consolidated the friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China. He said, our friendship is in the fundamental interests of both countries and their peoples. The Pakistani people believe that this friendship will strengthen world peace. A. Munaim Khan concluded by proposing a toast to the eternal friendship between Pakistan and China, and to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong.
