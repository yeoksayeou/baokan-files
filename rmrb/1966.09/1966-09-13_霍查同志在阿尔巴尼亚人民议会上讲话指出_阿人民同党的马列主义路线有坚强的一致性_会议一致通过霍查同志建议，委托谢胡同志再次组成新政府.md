The sixth session of the Albanian People's Assembly convened its first meeting on the morning of the 10th. Comrade Enver Hoxha, Haxhi Lleshi, Mehmet Shehu, and other party and government leaders of Albania attended the meeting.

The assembly elected Abdyl Kellezi as the chairman of the People's Assembly, Ylenia Pashko and Dimitër Shuteriqi as vice-chairmen, and Ramadan Çango as the secretary of the People's Assembly.

Under the chairmanship of Kellezi, the meeting adopted the main agenda: election of the Presidium of the People's Assembly, various committees of the People's Assembly, and personnel changes in the Supreme Court and the Prosecutor General's Office; appointment of the Council of Ministers; discussion and adoption of laws related to labor, social insurance, etc.

The meeting fully endorsed the activities of the previous government led by Mehmet Shehu since July 1962. Comrade Enver Hoxha spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, proposing that the meeting entrust Mehmet Shehu to form a new government. This proposal was warmly welcomed with applause from all the representatives. The meeting unanimously adopted the resolution to entrust Comrade Mehmet Shehu to form a new government.

Comrade Hoxha, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the victory of the Albanian Democratic Front in the elections on July 10 of this year most clearly demonstrated the close ties between the people and the people's government, strongly showing the unity between the people and the party, and the party's Marxist-Leninist line.

Comrade Hoxha said that during the past few years of the fifth session of the People's Assembly, the Albanian people have achieved a series of victories in industry, agriculture, culture, education, national defense, and the consolidation of national sovereignty.

Comrade Hoxha said that the government of the People's Republic of Albania, led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu, "faithfully implemented the party's line, the laws and resolutions of the People's Assembly. It did not betray the trust of the representatives of this session of the People's Assembly and successfully led the implementation of the third five-year plan." Comrade Hoxha said: "The Central Committee authorizes me to propose to the People's Assembly that it again entrust the Albanian Party of Labor Central Committee member, Political Bureau member, and loyal son of the party and the people, Comrade Mehmet Shehu, to form the new government of the People's Republic of Albania."

Comrade Hoxha concluded by saying: "The Central Committee believes that the government led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu will, in the future, fully implement the party's line and the tasks entrusted to it by the People's Assembly."

During this meeting, seven committees of the People's Assembly were also elected, and it was decided that the plenary session would continue on the afternoon of the 12th.
