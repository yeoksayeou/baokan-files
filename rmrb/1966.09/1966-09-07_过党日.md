Celebrating Party Day

"Invite Chairman Mao to Attend Our Meetings"
The Party branch of Xibei Dui in Taiyi Gong Public Commune, Chang'an County, Shaanxi, realized during a review of their work that they had not emphasized politics enough in the past few years, turning the Party branch into a production department. To build a combat-ready Party branch, they focused on studying Chairman Mao's works. They decided that every meeting should start with studying a section of Chairman Mao's works, listening to what Chairman Mao says, and then act accordingly. Now, they have established this practice as a regular routine and have seen good results. The comrades of the Xibei Dui Party branch affectionately call this practice "Inviting Chairman Mao to Attend Our Meetings."

Criticism from Relatives in Branch Meetings
The Party branch of Yuankou Dui in Pinghe Public Commune, Wencheng County, Zhejiang, holds two "Party Days" every month. Through these activities and studying Chairman Mao's works, the consciousness of Party members as the vanguard of the proletariat has been raised. They consciously maintain and carry forward the Party's three major styles, especially in handling criticism. Whether they are cadre Party members or ordinary Party members, they all consciously take up this weapon. Not only do ordinary comrades correctly carry out criticism, but even Party members with familial relationships can adhere to Party principles and actively engage in ideological struggle. Pre-party member Chen Jingcheng's wife Hu Songmei and his aunt Liu Linying are both Party members. During the branch meeting discussing Chen Jingcheng's conversion to full membership, they did not show favoritism or hesitate, but instead offered sharp criticism. Chen Jingcheng sincerely accepted the criticism and resolved to correct his mistakes.

County Committee Members Celebrating Party Day in Rural Branches
To strengthen Party building, the County Committee of Xinjian County, Jiangxi Province, decided that each committee member should celebrate Party Day with the commune Party committee or production brigade Party branch once every quarter. Deputy Secretary Liao Zhucai set an example by participating in four organizational life meetings of district, commune Party committees, and production brigade Party branches in the past year, giving political reports and Party lessons 15 times, and investigating the self-building situation of six grassroots Party branches. Because the county committee members went deep into the actual situation and obtained first-hand materials, the county committee could have a clear understanding and be targeted when studying work.

"Looking Back"
The Party branch of Fudian Dui in Zimu Public Commune, Chang'an County, Shaanxi, established a quarterly "Looking Back" system. "Looking Back" means reviewing one's thoughts and work against Chairman Mao's teachings to see what aligns with Chairman Mao's teachings and what does not. This way, Party members gradually establish the good practice of studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" when the direction is unclear, relying on the masses to do a good job, and criticizing when there are shortcomings, greatly enhancing the enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works.

    过党日
    “请毛主席参加我们的会”
    陕西长安县太乙宫公社新北大队党支部，在检查总结工作中，认识到前几年由于突出政治不够，把党支部变成了一个生产部。为了建设一个战斗化的党支部，他们就狠抓毛主席著作学习。他们决定每次开会都要先学一段毛主席著作，听听毛主席是怎么说的，以便好好照着毛主席的教导办事。现在，他们已经把这种做法当成一种制度定下来，并收到了很好的效果。新北大队党支部的同志们，把这种做法亲切地称为“请毛主席参加我们的会”。　孙福瑄
    亲属在支部会上的批评
    浙江文成县平和公社园口大队党支部每月都过两次“党日”，通过“党日”活动和学习毛主席著作，提高了党员的无产阶级先锋队的自觉性。他们自觉地保持和发扬党的三大作风，特别是在对待批评方面，不论是干部党员还是一般党员，都能自觉地拿起这一武器。不但一般同志间能够正确地开展批评，即使有亲属关系的党员之间也能坚持党的原则，积极开展思想斗争。预备党员陈景成的爱人胡松梅和叔婶廖林英都是党员，在讨论陈景成能否转正的支部大会上，她们都不讲私情，打破面子，对陈景成提出了尖锐的批评。陈景成也诚恳地表示接受，并决心改正。

    县委委员在农村支部里过党日
    为了加强党的建设，江西省新建县委决定，每个县委委员每季要同公社党委或大队党支部一起过一次党日。县委副书记廖竹咸同志以身作则，一年来参加区、社党委和大队党支部组织生活会四次，给基层党员作政治报告、上党课十五次，调查了六个基层党支部的自身建设情况。由于县委委员深入实际，掌握了第一手材料，使县委会在研究工作的时候，能够心中有数，有的放矢。

    “回头望”
    陕西省长安县子午公社甫店大队党支部，建立了每季一次“回头望”的制度。所谓“回头望”，就是对照毛主席的教导，回过头来，从思想到工作全面地看一看，看哪些符合毛主席的教导，做对了；哪些不符合毛主席的教导，做错了。这样，就使党员逐步树立起：方向不明学毛选，做好工作靠群众，有了缺点就批评的好作风，大大地提高了学习毛主席著作的积极性。　常维
