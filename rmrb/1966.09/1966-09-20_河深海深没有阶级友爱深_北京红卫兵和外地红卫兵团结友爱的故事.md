One night, after returning from Peking University to our dormitory, we took the wrong bus. After getting off, we searched for a long time but still couldn't find our lodging. It was already midnight.

I anxiously said, "Let's go to the train station and spend the night there!" My companion said, "That's fine." "Where are you going?" A voice full of enthusiasm and concern came from behind us. We turned around and saw several Beijing students enthusiastically catching up to us, saying, "Where are you going? We'll help you find it." At that moment, I despairingly said, "We only know the way to the gymnasium. Anyway, we won't find it." They resolutely said, "As long as it's in Beijing, we will definitely help you find it. We are all revolutionary comrades. We just returned from exchanging experiences with comrades from other places. You came to exchange experiences with us. We all have the same goal—to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." How touching those words were! At that moment, I was so moved that I couldn't say a word. They continued, "Let's go to the Workers' Stadium first, and then we'll look for another place." We walked and walked, and suddenly, the words "1966 International Table Tennis Invitational" in big red characters caught our eyes. Ah! That's right, isn't this the gymnasium we are looking for? I was so excited that tears welled up in my eyes. After a long time, I trembled and said, "You helped us find it. Please leave your names." They smiled and said, "We are all called Red Guards." Hearing their answer, my heart couldn't calm down for a long time.

When we reached the vicinity of the gymnasium, we thought we could find our lodging. However, due to the late hour and excessive tension, we forgot the lodging place near the gymnasium that we had remembered. My companion and I were wandering on the road, when a female comrade with a "Red Guard" armband came over and kindly asked, "Comrade, it's so late, why are you still standing here?" We explained the situation to her, and she said, "It's just ahead. I'll take you there." I asked, "Are you passing by?" She said, "I'm passing by. Let's go!" We reached the school gate, and she turned back to her original path. Ah! She came specifically to send us.

My companion and I stood there for a long time, looking at the night sky of Beijing, and our thoughts surged higher and higher. Party! Chairman Mao! It is you who have united the hearts of revolutionary students and teachers from all over the country. It is you who have established a deep revolutionary friendship among the Red Guards from all over the country, making us more united. The whole country is my home. Dear Chairman Mao! I will definitely bring back the precious revolutionary experiences from Peking University and other schools, and like the Red Guards in the capital, I will carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to pioneer. I will believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and resolutely act according to your instructions. I will care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Let me sing loudly: "The party's love is greater than the heavens and the earth, parents' love is not as deep as Chairman Mao's love, everything is good, but socialism is the best. The depth of class love is deeper than rivers and seas..."

    河深海深没有阶级友爱深
    ——北京红卫兵和外地红卫兵团结友爱的故事
    辽宁省朝阳专区卫生学校红卫兵　白桦
    一天晚上，我们从北京大学回宿舍，乘错了车，下车后找了好久，仍没有找到住地。这时已是深夜十二点了。
    我着急地说：“咱们到火车站去过一夜吧！”同伴说：“也好。”“你们到哪去？”一个充满热情和关怀的声音从后边传来，我们回头一看，几位北京同学热情地跟上来说：“你们上哪？我们帮助找。”当时我失望地说：“我们就知道体育馆，反正找不到了。”他们斩钉截铁地说：“只要在北京，我们一定帮你们找到。咱们都是革命的战友，我们刚从外地交流经验回来，你们到我们这里来交流经验，都是为了一个目的，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”多么感人的话呀！我当时激动得一句话也说不出来。他们又说：“先到工人体育馆看看，不是再找别的。”我们走呀，走呀，突然，“一九六六年国际乒乓球邀请赛”这几个大红字映入我的眼帘，啊！对了，这不正是我们要找的体育馆吗！我激动得热泪盈眶，好久才颤抖地说了一句：“帮我们找到了，请留下你们的名字吧！”他们笑笑说：“我们都叫红卫兵。”听了他们的回答，我的心久久不能平静下来。
    到了体育馆附近，我们满以为可以找到住宿地了。由于夜深，精神过度紧张，本来记得在体育馆附近的住宿地又忘记了。我和同伴正在路上徘徊，一位臂戴“红卫兵”袖章的女同志过来，亲切地问我们：“同志，夜这么深了，还在这儿站着干什么？”我们向她说明了原因，她说：“就在前面，我送你们去。”我问：“您路过吗？”她说：“路过，走吧！”我们到了校门口，她转身又往原来的路走去。啊！她是专来送我们的。
    我和同伴久久地站在那里，望着北京的夜空，思潮一阵高似一阵。党啊！毛主席啊！是您把祖国各地革命师生的心联在一起了，是您使我们全国各地的红卫兵建立起了深厚的革命友谊，团结得更紧了。祖国到处都是我的亲人。亲爱的毛主席呀！我一定把北大和其他学校宝贵的革命经验带回去，也像首都的红卫兵们一样，发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯的革命精神，相信群众，依靠群众，坚决按照您的指示办事，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。让我放开喉咙歌唱：“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千好万好不如社会主义好，河深海深不如阶级友爱深。……”
