The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, the Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association, and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries today sent separate telegrams to relevant Japanese organizations and Japanese youth delegations preparing to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally. They expressed their strongest support and highest respect for the Japanese youth who, despite the violent suppression by the Sato government, resolutely demand to come to China to participate in the friendly rally.

The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, in its telegram, strongly protested against the Sato government of Japan, which disregards the legitimate rights of the Japanese people, harbors hostility towards China, and engages in reactionary behavior to sabotage Sino-Japanese youth friendship exchanges. The telegram pointed out that the fighting unity of the peoples of China, Japan, and Asia-Africa is an irresistible historical trend. No matter what conspiracies the U.S. imperialists, Japanese reactionaries, and Soviet modern revisionists, along with their various followers, may employ, they cannot destroy this unity.

The telegrams from the Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries stated that the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of youth and people in both China and Japan. The opposition from a small clique of reactionary forces that follow U.S. imperialism and are hostile to Sino-Japanese friendship only proves that we are right and doing well! The telegrams pointed out that the despicable tactics of the Sato government to sabotage Sino-Japanese friendly exchanges and worsen Sino-Japanese relations appear to be aggressive but are actually nothing to be afraid of. They are weak. We believe that as long as the Japanese youth are determined and united in their struggle, they will definitely overcome all obstacles and achieve new victories in coming to China to participate in this grand rally!

The telegrams from the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, the Chinese-Japanese Friendship Association, and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries were sent separately to the Japanese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, the Japanese-Chinese Friendship Association, and seventeen Japanese youth delegations preparing to come to China to participate in the friendly rally.

    我亚非团结会等抗议佐藤政府破坏中日青年友好往来
    坚决支持日本青年反对美日反动派的斗争
    新华社二十七日讯  中国亚非团结委员会、中国日本友好协会和中国人民对外文化友好协会，今天分别打电报给日本有关团体和准备参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢的日本各青年代表团，对日本青年不畏佐藤政府的暴力镇压，坚决要求来我国参加友好大联欢而进行的斗争，表示最坚决的支持和最崇高的敬意。
    中国亚非团结委员会在电报中强烈抗议日本佐藤政府无视日本人民的正当权利，敌视中国，破坏中日青年友好往来的反动行为。电报指出，中日两国人民和亚非人民的战斗团结，是不可阻挡的历史潮流，不管美帝国主义、日本反动派和苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者采取什么阴谋手段，也是破坏不了的。
    中日友协和对外友协的电报说，第二届中日青年友好大联欢受到了中日两国广大青年和人民的热烈欢迎。一小撮追随美帝国主义、仇视中日友好的反动势力加以反对，这正说明我们做得对，做得好！电报指出，佐藤政府破坏中日友好往来，恶化中日关系的卑劣作法，表面上气势汹汹，实际上没有什么了不起的。它们是虚弱的。我们相信，日本青年只要下定决心，团结斗争，就一定能够排除一切障碍，取得来华参加本届大联欢的新胜利！
    中国亚非团结委员会、中日友协和对外友协的电报是分别发给日本亚非团结委员会、日本中国友好协会以及十七个准备来我国参加友好大联欢的日本青年代表团的。
