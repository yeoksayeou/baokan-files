According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, September 24th — The Vietnamese People's Daily published an editorial on September 24th stating: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have repeatedly declared that the United Nations has no right to interfere in Vietnamese affairs.

The article strongly refutes the speech made by the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, on September 22nd at the United Nations General Assembly. The article states, "The stubborn American aggressors, who are persistently waging a war of aggression, are intensifying their new war plans against both North and South Vietnam. Their talk of 'peace negotiations' is deceitful. They want to speak with weapons, and we will definitely respond with weapons."

After listing Goldberg's so-called three-point "proposals," the article points out that these "proposals" are essentially the same old tricks he has peddled in many different places. The content of these arguments remains "conditional cessation of bombing" and "conditional withdrawal of troops." The U.S. imperialists once again reveal their extremely stubborn attitude, refusing to acknowledge that the National Liberation Front is the sole legitimate representative of the people of South Vietnam, and deliberately reversing the positions of the aggressors and the anti-aggressors.

The article states that the U.S. aggressors have suffered heavy defeats in South Vietnam, recklessly escalating the war by launching air strikes against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This is an extremely arrogant act of war and aggression.

The article points out that the key to stopping the war is that the aggressors must unconditionally stop their war actions. The aggressors have no right to impose any conditions on those fighting against aggression. After suffering increasingly heavy defeats in Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors now want to use the cessation of bombing as a ploy to make the people of South Vietnam lay down their arms. This plot of U.S. imperialism will not succeed.

The article emphasizes that if the U.S. imperialists truly want peace, they must stop the war of aggression and withdraw all U.S. troops and mercenary forces from South Vietnam. They have no right to impose any conditions on the withdrawal of troops.

When refuting the U.S. aggressors' claim that they do not want to establish permanent military bases in South Vietnam, the article asks, what right do the U.S. aggressors have to establish any permanent or non-permanent military bases in South Vietnam? The logic is simple: withdraw all U.S. troops and mercenary forces, and dismantle all U.S. military bases in South Vietnam.

The article states that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam is the sole legitimate representative of the people of South Vietnam, and it controls the situation in South Vietnam. The National Liberation Front must have a decisive say in resolving the issue of South Vietnam. If U.S. imperialism does not acknowledge this, it will not be able to get out of the dead end.

The article points out that in just the past two months, the U.S. authorities have sent an additional 35,000 U.S. troops and 6,500 mercenary troops to South Vietnam; in just a few days in early September, it sent an additional 11,550 U.S. troops and mercenary troops to South Vietnam. To achieve the new "escalation" of the war, the U.S. aggressors plan to increase the number of U.S. expeditionary forces in South Vietnam to over 400,000 by the end of this year. This is the so-called "peaceful intention" of the United States.

The article states that the purpose of the U.S. aggressors in proposing so-called "proposals" at the United Nations is to attempt to use the United Nations to interfere in Vietnamese affairs, making the United Nations serve their aggressive plots and "peace" deception.

The article reaffirms that the most correct way to resolve the Vietnamese issue is the four-point proposal of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

    越南《人民报》发表评论严正指出
    联合国无权干涉越南问题  美帝和谈骗局绝不能得逞
    据新华社河内二十四日电　越南《人民报》二十四日发表评论员文章说：越南民主共和国政府和越南南方民族解放阵线曾经多次声明，联合国无权干涉越南问题。
    这篇文章严厉驳斥了美国驻联合国代表戈德堡九月二十二日在联合国大会上的发言。文章说，“顽固地进行侵略战争的美国侵略集团，正在加紧对越南南北两方推行新的战争计划，它的‘和平讨论’的论调是骗人的。它们想用武器来说话，我们也一定继续用武器来同它们说话。”
    文章在列举了戈德堡在发言中提出的所谓三点“建议”以后指出，这些“建议”实质上仍然是他曾在许多不同地方多次兜售过的陈旧货色。这些论调的内容仍然是“有条件的停止轰炸”和“有条件的撤军”。美帝国主义再一次表明了极其顽固的态度，不肯承认民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的唯一的合法代表，并蓄意颠倒黑白，颠倒侵略者和反侵略者的位置。
    文章说，美国侵略者在越南南方遭到惨败，冒险地进行“战争升级”，用空军袭击越南民主共和国。这是极其蛮横的战争和侵略行动。
    文章指出，停止战争的关键问题，是发动战争的侵略者必须无条件地停止战争行动。侵略者无权向进行反侵略战斗的人提出任何条件。美国侵略者在越南遭到了日益惨重的失败后，却想用停止轰炸的阴谋来使越南南方同胞放下武器。美帝国主义的这一阴谋是不可能得逞的。
    文章强调说，如果美帝国主义者真正希望和平，那末他必须停止侵略战争，把美国军队和帮凶军全部从越南南方撤走。他无权就撤军问题提出任何条件。
    文章驳斥美国侵略者所谓不想在南越设立常备军事基地的论调时说，美国侵略者有什么权利在越南南方设立什么常备和不常备的军事基地呢？把美国军队和帮凶军全部撤走，撤销在南越的所有美国军事基地，这是十分简单的道理。
    文章说，越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的唯一的真正代表，它控制着越南南方的局势。越南南方民族解放阵线必须在解决越南南方问题中有自己决定性的发言权。美帝国主义不肯承认这一点，那末他就无法走出死胡同。
    文章指出，仅在最近两个多月里，美国当局就向南越增派了美军三万五千名，帮凶军六千五百名；单在九月初的几天中，它就向南越增派了美军和帮凶军一万一千五百五十名。为了实现新的战争“升级”，美国侵略者打算在今年年底把在南越的美国远征军增加到四十多万名，这就是美国的所谓“和平诚意”。
    文章说，美国侵略者在联合国提出所谓“建议”的目的，是妄图利用联合国干涉越南问题，让联合国为他们的侵略阴谋和“和平”欺骗手段效劳。
    文章重申，解决越南问题的最正确办法，就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
