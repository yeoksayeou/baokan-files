The Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam have been strengthening their political work to ensure victory over American aggressors under any circumstances. The U.S. Marine Corps suffered heavy losses in a "sweep" operation near the 17th Parallel.

HANOI, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam recently held their second political work conference. The conference decided to strengthen political work to ensure that the Liberation Armed Forces will decisively defeat American aggressors under any circumstances.

The conference sent a telegram to the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, stating that the conference was pleased to see that through political work, the line of the National Liberation Front has been deeply ingrained in every unit, enabling the three armed forces to rapidly grow and achieve brilliant results in construction and combat. It is certain that more and greater victories will be achieved in the future.

The telegram said that all representatives at the conference pledged to study and implement the line of the National Liberation Front for building armed forces, to strengthen political work, and to creatively apply the various principles of political work proposed by the conference. This will ensure the completion of current tasks, the rapid growth of the Liberation Armed Forces, and the ability to decisively defeat American aggressors under any circumstances.

SAIGON, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) - According to reports from Saigon, the Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam launched fierce attacks on American invaders in the northern part of Quang Tri Province near the 17th Parallel in recent days, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

According to reports from Western news agencies, on September 15, more than 1,200 U.S. Marines, based on the Seventh Fleet, landed in the non-military zone just four kilometers south of the northern part of Quang Tri Province, launching a new "sweep" operation. Shortly after these American invaders landed, they were met with a fierce counterattack by the Liberation Armed Forces in Quang Tri Province. According to a U.S. military spokesman, a U.S. Marine patrol was hit by "moderate" casualties on the night of September 15.

Western news agencies reported that two companies of U.S. Marines were surrounded by the Liberation Armed Forces in the non-military zone about five kilometers south of the area on September 16 and 17. They were attacked by mortars and machine guns from the Liberation Armed Forces in the jungle, with "nothing to eat or drink," and were unable to break out. Nine U.S. aircraft were shot down or damaged by the intense fire of the Liberation Armed Forces in this area.
