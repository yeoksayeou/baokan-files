The China-Nepal Friendship Association held a reception tonight to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the association's establishment.

Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the reception.

At the reception, filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Chu Tu-nan, and Nepalese Ambassador to China, Rendra Subba, delivered speeches.

Chu Tu-nan said in his speech, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We must strive to establish normal diplomatic relations with all countries that are willing to live in peace with us, on the basis of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty and equality and mutual benefit.' Our government and people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have always pursued a policy of peaceful coexistence with neighboring countries and have firmly adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in relations with countries of different social systems. We are confident that, in the future, with the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Nepal will continue to be strengthened and consolidated in the common struggle of the Asian and African countries for unity and anti-imperialism."

Ambassador Rendra Subba said in his speech, "The friendship between Nepal and China is genuine. Because it is based on a reliable foundation, that foundation is the sincere adherence to the principle of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and respect for each other's way of life and ideological views."

The ambassador, when speaking about China's aid to Nepal, said, "China is a good friend, its aid is selfless. The Nepalese people are very happy about the great achievements made by the Chinese people."

The ambassador concluded by proposing a toast to the friendship between the peoples of Nepal and China, and to the health and longevity of Chairman Mao.
