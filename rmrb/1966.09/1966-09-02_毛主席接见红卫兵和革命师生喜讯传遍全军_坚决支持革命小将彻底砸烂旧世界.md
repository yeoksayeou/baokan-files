Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao has once again come to Tiananmen Square to receive 500,000 Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country and the capital. The joyous news has spread like a spring breeze to the front lines of the sea defenses, border outposts, air force bases, and various military camps. The broad masses of soldiers and officers in the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, with hearts full of boundless excitement and emotion, enthusiastically shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and sing "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea." The soldiers and officers once again firmly declare: We vow to stand together with the broad revolutionary students and Red Guard youth, under the command of the great commander and supreme commander Chairman Mao, to unite and fight, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new high tide.

Many soldiers and officers stationed at the southern gate of the motherland, Hainan Island, gathered in the square this morning, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's quotations, waving colorful flags, and beating drums and gongs, to listen to the live broadcast. When everyone heard the joyous news that our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao appeared before the revolutionary students in the first open-top car, cheers and songs filled the air. Many soldiers and officers in the communications troops, after listening to the broadcast, immediately used the telephone to quickly pass on this joyous news to the soldiers who have been living scattered in rural areas and remote mountainous regions for years, maintaining long-distance lines. The soldiers, upon hearing this news over the telephone, immediately shouted with joy: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" They excitedly said, "Although we are far from Beijing, we always feel as if we are by Chairman Mao's side, feeling infinitely happy."

Many soldiers and officers, in their discussions, excitedly said that our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, in just twenty days, met with revolutionary masses from the capital and all over the country three times. This most powerfully shows that Chairman Mao most trusts the masses, most supports the masses, most loves the masses, and most respects the masses' spirit of innovation.

The soldiers and officers, in their discussions, enthusiastically praised the revolutionary spirit and actions of the Red Guards, and warmly welcomed their achievements in the Cultural Revolution. Many old Red Army soldiers in a certain unit of the Kunming forces excitedly said, "Our Red Guard youth are truly the youth of the Mao Zedong era. They are fearless, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to rebel, and dare to make revolution. They have become the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution, breaking the 'Four Olds' and sweeping away all ghosts and monsters, establishing great achievements. We firmly support the Red Guards' revolution, most resolutely support the Red Guards' revolutionary actions, and most resolutely be the strong backing of the Red Guards! Many soldiers and officers said, "Revolutionary students from all over the country gathering in Beijing is a great exchange of experiences in the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary students, carrying the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, will return to their respective places, and the revolutionary flames will burn more fiercely across the country. We are proud to have such close comrades-in-arms and such a reserve force."

The soldiers and officers unanimously declared that they will definitely, under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all actions, and use the "Sixteen Articles" as a weapon, to resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Deputy Battalion Commander Lin Bingyuan of a certain unit in the Wuhan forces said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the Cultural Revolution to achieve complete victory. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, remember the 'Sixteen Articles' in our minds, carve them in our hearts, and implement them in our actions, to thoroughly smash the old world, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, without victory, we will not stop."

    毛主席接见红卫兵和革命师生喜讯传遍全军
    坚决支持革命小将彻底砸烂旧世界
    据新华社一日讯　我们的伟大导师，伟大领袖，伟大统帅，伟大舵手毛主席再次来到天安门广场，接见来自全国各地和首都的五十万红卫兵和革命师生的喜讯，像春风一样传到海防前线，边防哨所，空军机场和各个营区，人民解放军陆海空军广大指战员怀着无限兴奋和激动的心情，纵情欢呼“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”纵情歌唱《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》。指战员们再一次坚定地表示：誓与广大革命师生、红卫兵小将们站在一起，在伟大统帅、最高司令毛主席的指挥下，团结战斗，把无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新的高潮。
    驻守在祖国南大门海南岛的许多部队指战员，今天上午举着毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，挥舞着彩旗，敲锣打鼓，汇集到广场上，收听实况录音广播。当大家听到我们的伟大导师，伟大领袖，伟大统帅，伟大舵手毛主席乘坐第一辆敞篷汽车出现在革命师生面前的喜讯时，欢呼声、歌唱声响成一片。通信兵部队许多指战员收听了广播以后，当天就用电话迅速把这个喜讯传给了长年分散居住在农村和偏僻山区担任长途线路维护任务的战士。战士们从电话里听到这一喜讯后，当即纵情欢呼：“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们激动地说：“我们虽然远离北京，但我们时刻都像在毛主席的身旁，感到无限幸福。”
    许多部队指战员在座谈时激动地说，最敬爱的领袖毛主席，在短短二十天时间里，三次和首都及来自全国各地的革命群众见面，最有力地说明了毛主席最相信群众，最支持群众，最热爱群众，最尊重群众的首创精神。
    指战员们在座谈中满腔热情赞扬红卫兵的革命精神和革命行动，热烈欢呼他们在文化大革命中创建的功勋。昆明部队某部的许多老红军战士兴奋地说，我们的红卫兵小将们，不愧为毛泽东时代的青少年，他们天不怕、地不怕，敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢于革命、敢于造反，充当了文化大革命的急先锋，大破“四旧”、横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，建立了伟大的功勋。我们坚决支持红卫兵革命，最坚决地支持红卫兵的革命行动，最坚决地做红卫兵的强大后盾！许多部队指战员说，来自全国各地革命师生在北京会师，是对文化大革命经验的大交流，革命师生们带着毛主席、党中央的指示回到各地，革命的烈火必将在全国更加熊熊燃烧，越烧越旺。我们为有这样的亲密战友，为有这样的后备军感到自豪。
    指战员们还一致表示，一定在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，以毛泽东思想作为一切行动的指针，以十六条为武器，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。武汉部队某部副营长林炳远说，毛泽东思想是文化大革命取得彻底胜利的根本保证，我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把十六条记在脑子里，刻在心坎上，落实到行动中，彻底砸烂旧世界，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
