Mao Zedong Thought Brings New Hope to All Humanity
People of Asia and Africa Deeply Love Chairman Mao and Warmly Praise Mao Zedong Thought

According to Xinhua News Agency, the people of various countries in Asia and Africa have boundless love for Chairman Mao. They praise Chairman Mao as the great teacher of the world's people, saying that every word Chairman Mao says is the truth, and that Mao Zedong Thought is a precious treasure for the people of the world.

A Ghanaian intellectual recently said: Chairman Mao Zedong is the great teacher of the world's people. The brilliance of Mao Zedong's works not only illuminates the path to victory for the Chinese people but has also been proven by the struggles of the Vietnamese people and other peoples around the world to be universal truths.

The representative of the All-African Trade Union Federation in East and Central Africa, Jinbixili, told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: Chairman Mao Zedong enjoys a very high reputation among the people of Africa. He said, Mao Zedong Thought is a true revolutionary thought, and Chairman Mao's teachings are immortal.

A famous singer from the national "Zoliba" dance troupe of Guinea, Masali, told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: "I love Chairman Mao. He is a great revolutionary. My voice cannot express the respect I feel for him."

He sang loudly in public the Chinese song "The Ship Sails on the Sea Relying on the Helmsman" and a song created by a Guinean singer during a visit to China, "The Fighting Africans Sing of Chairman Mao and His Greatness." Everyone present was deeply moved by his profound feelings for Chairman Mao and applauded enthusiastically.

A Guinean worker asked a Chinese comrade for a magazine with a cover featuring Chairman Mao's portrait. He said he wanted to cut out Chairman Mao's portrait from the magazine and hang it in his room so he could see Chairman Mao every day.

An Iraqi scientist, Ibrahim Nasir, who participated in the Beijing Summer Physics Discussion, said: The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the entire world, bringing new hope to all humanity. Every word Chairman Mao says is the truth. Now, the nations and peoples oppressed by imperialism, as long as they advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, will be able to achieve revolutionary victory.
