    To our dearest Chairman Mao, we will forever stand guard by your side.
    All the guards of Tiananmen

    In these days, we have been immersed in boundless happiness and joy. On the afternoon of the 15th, we saw our great leader Chairman Mao again. He waved to us repeatedly. At that moment, we forgot everything, tears streaming down our faces as we joined everyone else in clapping wildly and shouting loudly. Our hands went numb from clapping, our throats hoarse from shouting, but we still did not stop shouting and singing enthusiastically. We shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" a thousand times, ten thousand times, but it still couldn't express our boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao!

    Time, why do you pass so quickly? Why don't you let these happy moments linger a little longer? Do you know the hearts of the soldiers? We long to see Chairman Mao so much! Seeing him once is not enough, twice is not enough, even three times is not enough. We truly wish to see Chairman Mao every day and forever stand guard by his side.

    Chairman Mao, for the sake of resolutely carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and sweeping away all harmful elements and removing all obstacles, you tirelessly receive the revolutionary masses time and time again. Every time you appear before the revolutionary masses, you give us immense encouragement and boundless strength, pointing out the direction for us to advance. Chairman Mao, you always lead the way for the masses. You have set a brilliant example for all Marxist-Leninists in upholding the mass line.

    The current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent. The great spiritual force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has turned into a powerful material force, and industrial and agricultural production is advancing rapidly along the path of more, faster, better, and cheaper!

    Why, in such a short time, has our country undergone such earth-shaking changes, and why has the Cultural Revolution achieved such great successes? It is because this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was initiated and led by our great leader, great teacher, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao. The victory of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Dearest Chairman Mao, we are the guards of Tiananmen. We will forever stand guard by your side. We vow to defend you, defend the Party Central Committee, and uphold Mao Zedong Thought with our lives. We will resolutely follow your words: care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    最敬爱的毛主席  我们永远守卫在您的身旁
    守卫天安门的全体警卫战士
    这些天来，我们一直沉浸在无限幸福和欢乐中。十五日下午，我们又见到了伟大的领袖毛主席，他老人家向我们频频招手。这时，我们忘记了一切，含着眼泪和大家一道拚命地鼓掌，不停地高呼。手拍麻了，嗓子喊哑了，但我们仍不停地高呼，使劲地欢唱。我们喊一千声一万声毛主席万岁，也无法表达我们对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜！
    时间呀！你为什么过得这样快？这样幸福的时刻，你为什么不让它多停留一会？你知道我们战士的心吗？我们是多么想见毛主席呀！我们看一次不够、二次不够、三次还是不够。我们真想天天见到毛主席，永远守卫在毛主席身旁。
    毛主席呀！您老人家为了坚决将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为了扫除一切害人虫、搬掉一切绊脚石，您不辞辛苦地一次又一次接见革命群众。您每一次出现在革命群众面前，都给了我们巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量，给我们指出了前进的方向。毛主席呀！您永远走在群众的最前头，您为全世界马克思列宁主义者作出了坚持群众路线的最光辉榜样。
    当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势非常好。无产阶级文化大革命的巨大精神力量变成了强大物质力量，工农业生产正沿着多快好省的道路飞速前进！
    为什么在这短短的时间里，我国会有这样翻天覆地的变化，文化革命会取得这样大的成绩呢？就是因为这次无产阶级文化大革命是我们伟大的领袖、伟大的导师、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席亲自发起和领导的。这次无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，就是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    最最敬爱的毛主席呀！我们是天安门的警卫战士，我们永远守卫在您的身旁，我们誓死保卫您、保卫党中央、捍卫毛泽东思想。我们坚决听您的话：关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
