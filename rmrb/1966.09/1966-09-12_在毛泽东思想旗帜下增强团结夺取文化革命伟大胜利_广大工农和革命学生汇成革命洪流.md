The editorial "Workers, Peasants, and Revolutionary Students United Under the Banner of Mao Zedong Thought," published in today's *People's Daily*, has been enthusiastically endorsed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary students across the country. They have expressed their determination to hold high the invincible red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to inspire, learn from, support, and rely on each other, forming a mighty revolutionary torrent, and to jointly achieve a great victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

The broad masses of workers, Red Guards, and revolutionary students in the capital have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call, expressing their resolve to fight more unitedly under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Workers from the People's Printing Press said that since the revolutionary youngsters took to the battlefield, they have smashed the "four olds" and exposed many ghosts and monsters, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. They dare to think, dare to do, dare to venture, and dare to revolutionize, serving as the vanguard of the cultural revolution. Our workers and revolutionary students share the same revolutionary direction. We resolutely support their revolutionary actions. We must unite and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

Today, part of the Red Guards from Beijing Institute of Mining and Technology, who are participating in the autumn harvest at Yonghong Production Brigade in Dongsheng Commune in the suburbs, studied the editorial from the *People's Daily* together with poor and lower-middle peasants in the fields. The Red Guard fighters said: Workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of this proletarian cultural revolution. They love the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao the most, have the most steadfast proletarian stance, and are the most loyal to the people. We revolutionary students must learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers and, together with them, strive for the complete victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Workers in Shanghai have expressed their determination to better support revolutionary students in the cultural revolution. The director of the Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee of the Third Steel Plant in Shanghai, converter steelworker Chen Fu, said: The revolutionary direction of the revolutionary students is completely correct, and their achievements are great. We workers and revolutionary students unite, and we will surely push the cultural revolution forward with even more surging waves. Many revolutionary students from East China Normal University have recently received letters from poor and lower-middle peasants from people's communes where they once participated in the socialist education movement, praising their revolutionary actions and encouraging them to study Chairman Mao's works and grow better in the struggle. These students are determined not to disappoint the expectations of the workers and peasants.

Li Zhaozhen, a famous labor model from Tianjin and a representative of the National People's Congress, said that the great achievements made by the broad Red Guards and revolutionary students in the proletarian cultural revolution have greatly inspired the working class. We resolutely support their revolutionary actions. Revolutionary students from Nankai University and Hebei Red Guard Military School unanimously believe that we revolutionary students must learn the excellent qualities of the workers and peasants, learn their unconditional loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, and model the implementation of the Sixteen Points.

Wang Feng'en, a deputy chief engineer from Shenyang Transformer Factory who is a worker by origin, said that revolutionary students have done a lot of good things and made a lot of good proposals in the cultural revolution, which are what the working class has in mind and wants to do with their own hands. We must join hands with the revolutionary students and fight shoulder to shoulder, and we will not allow anyone to sabotage the unity of the workers and peasants with the revolutionary students. Yi Fengying, a labor model from Shenyang and a representative of the National People's Congress, said that we, the working class, and the broad Red Guards and revolutionary students are like melons on the same vine, comrades-in-arms bound by blood. We must unite under the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought and jointly achieve a great victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. Yang Jianfa, an agricultural labor model from Liaoning Province and the chairman of Wusan People's Commune in the suburbs of Shenyang, excitedly talked about the friendship between the commune members and revolutionary students since the cultural revolution. He said: We poor and lower-middle peasants must unite closely with the revolutionary students and direct our guns at those in power who are taking the capitalist road.

Today's editorial has been enthusiastically endorsed by the broad masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary students in the Wuhan area. Ma Xueli, a worker engineer from Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory and a representative of the National People's Congress, said: With our great leader Chairman Mao at the helm and the firm unity of our workers and peasants with revolutionary students under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the cultural revolution will surely achieve complete victory. Ding Fengying, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works who came to Wuhan to participate in the school anniversary of Wuhan University, and the party branch secretary of Beifeng Brigade, Luotian County, Hubei Province, enthusiastically expressed that we are confident that revolutionary students can educate themselves in the revolution and will surely carry out the cultural revolution well according to the Sixteen Points, and at the same time, in the current stormy class struggle, they will temper themselves into a set of class struggle skills.

The broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants in Guangzhou have expressed their enthusiastic support for the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and their determination to carry out the cultural revolution to the end together with them. Two active learners of Chairman Mao's works, He Lirong, a driver from Guangzhou Automobile Company, and Zhang Quan, an old worker from Xinjiannan Box Factory, expressed that the working class resolutely stands with the Red Guards to smash the old rules, old customs, and old order of the bourgeoisie. The poor and lower-middle peasants from Xiaoping Brigade in Shiping Commune in the suburbs of Guangzhou said that poor and lower-middle peasants and Red Guards are class brothers and revolutionary comrades-in-arms. Whoever suppresses the Red Guards is suppressing us poor and lower-middle peasants and suppressing the revolution. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree to it.

Su Jinhe, the locomotive driver of the "631" crew from Xi'an Railway Bureau Xi'an Locomotive Section and a representative of the National People's Congress, said: Revolutionary students are full of vigor, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to venture, dare to do, and dare to revolutionize. Their actions are swift and powerful, making those in power who are taking the capitalist road panic-stricken. Their revolutionary actions are great, and we, the working class, warmly welcome and resolutely support them. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongxin Village in Zhangjia Gorge Commune in the suburbs of Xi'an believe that today's editorial fully expresses their wishes. Revolutionary students from various schools in Xi'an were all inspired and encouraged after hearing the editorial, believing that this is another instance of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee supporting them. They expressed their determination to seriously learn the revolutionary spirit and excellent qualities of the workers and peasants and unite with the workers and peasants to make the revolution.

In Chengdu, Tian Jingqi, a famous labor model, deputy director of Chengdu Gauge and Tool Factory, and a representative of the National People's Congress, expressed his determination to most enthusiastically and resolutely support the revolutionary actions of revolutionary teachers and students. Zhu Haiqing, the brigade leader of Qingyang Brigade in Jingmenkou Commune in the suburbs of Chengdu, a model agricultural unit in Sichuan Province, said that we must more resolutely support the great revolutionary spirit of revolutionary students, care for and encourage them wholeheartedly, and temper them into steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the great storms of the cultural revolution.
