The editor of Xinhua News Agency notes: Chairman Mao said in his instructions that the People's Liberation Army should be a great school. This great school can engage in mass work, participate in the socialist education movement in factories and rural areas; after the socialist education movement, there is always mass work to be done, so that the military and the people are always united as one. The certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, together with sister units, rushed to the Xingtai region, which had suffered severe earthquake damage, to serve as a propaganda team and a sowing machine for Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically promoting Mao Zedong Thought among the people. This is an excellent example of following Chairman Mao's instructions, strengthening mass work, and achieving remarkable results. In the disaster area, they not only armed the people with Mao Zedong Thought, mobilized the people, and overcame the earthquake disaster; they also greatly improved the ideological level of the broad cadres and soldiers, effectively promoting the ideological revolutionization of the army. At the same time, the army and the people were more closely united by the great Mao Zedong Thought, becoming more intimate and united as one.

Firmly carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions that the People's Liberation Army is a great school, strengthening mass work, and always uniting with the people is of paramount importance. It is essential to widely promote Mao Zedong Thought among the people, help the people learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, propagate wherever you go, and let Mao Zedong Thought take deep root in the minds of the people. Comrade Lin Biao said: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million. It needs a unified, revolutionary, and correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought." He also said: "We must propagate Mao Zedong Thought among workers and peasants through learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, so as to change the spiritual outlook of the working people and transform spiritual strength into tremendous material force." We must follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions and always be good propagators and sowers of Mao Zedong Thought.

Propagating among the masses, educating ourselves. Chairman Mao said: "To learn Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and contact with workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." In the new historical period, stepping out of the barracks and going to the three great revolutionary practices, learning Mao Zedong Thought from promoting Mao Zedong Thought is particularly important. The practice of this unit has proven that this propaganda has given the cadres and soldiers the most practical, vivid, and profound class education, people's army education, and people's war education; it has also found new ways to carry forward the glorious tradition of the army uniting with the people, implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to "learn humbly from the local areas," voluntarily accept the leadership of the local party committees, and accept the supervision of the people.

Let our army and some schools and organizations with conditions follow Chairman Mao's instructions, be propagators and sowers of Mao Zedong Thought, and often promote the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought among the people!

In April and May of this year, we, together with sister units, formed a propaganda team of ten thousand people to promote Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of the Xingtai region. More than a month of practice has proven: promoting Mao Zedong Thought among the people not only changed the spiritual outlook of the working people, transforming spiritual strength into tremendous material force, but also educated ourselves, effectively promoting the ideological revolutionization of the army.

Chairman Mao said: "To learn Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and contact with workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." We followed Chairman Mao's instructions, stepped out of the barracks, went among the people, and went to the three great revolutionary practices to learn and temper ourselves, promoting Mao Zedong Thought. This made the army receive the most practical, vivid, and profound Mao Zedong Thought education. The army doing mass work is one of the three major tasks set by Chairman Mao for our army. The army promoting Mao Zedong Thought among the people is the most important and fundamental mass work. This time, we went to the countryside and to the people's struggle in the great waves to promote Mao Zedong Thought, which is a great promotion of the glorious tradition of the army uniting with the people; it is a new battlefield for implementing the five principles of emphasizing politics; it is a great classroom for learning from the local people and promoting the ideological revolutionization of the army; it is also an important measure to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause and fundamentally improve the army's combat effectiveness.

Propagating among the masses, educating ourselves. In this propaganda, we received the deepest education and the greatest harvest in the following five aspects:

First, we further strengthened our class feelings in studying Chairman Mao's works and our awareness of working hard on the "application" aspect.

To propagate among the masses, we must first educate ourselves. To answer the people's questions with Mao Zedong Thought, we must first arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought; to make the people act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we must first execute Chairman Mao's instructions. Only then can we explain the principles clearly and speak with authority. This time, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works before the propaganda, reviewing "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Moving the Mountains." During the propaganda, we always took Chairman Mao's books as the guiding principles for all our actions, studying and applying them repeatedly. For every lecture, for every problem solved for the people, we studied and applied repeatedly. This greatly promoted the cadres and soldiers' awareness of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and working hard on the "application" aspect.

In the propaganda activities, the people's boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, and the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, also gave the broad cadres and soldiers a very profound education. From the propaganda, we deeply felt that where the light of Mao Zedong Thought shines, a new situation emerges. In the face of disasters, reading Chairman Mao's books makes people spirited; in the face of difficulties, talking about Chairman Mao's works makes people see the light and forge ahead. Some young people who were not enthusiastic about agricultural labor decided to take root in the countryside and farm for the revolution after hearing Chairman Mao's words; some women who did not go to the fields, attend meetings, or study changed after hearing Chairman Mao's words, shouldering hoes to go to the fields, attending meetings without fail, and studying Chairman Mao's works enthusiastically. Countless vivid facts made all the cadres and soldiers deeply feel: "Chairman Mao's words are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences."

Propagating among the masses, educating ourselves. In the intense propaganda activities, the cadres and soldiers were more aware of studying Chairman Mao's works and working hard on the "application" aspect. Many people reviewed their daily activities every day, thinking about what was in line with Chairman Mao's thoughts and what was not done well enough, strictly demanding of themselves. The whole army became more advanced, and the backward caught up. A backward soldier used to think that "not studying Chairman Mao's works won't change one's nature." After going to the countryside, the vivid examples of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants learning and applying Chairman Mao's works made him realize that not studying Chairman Mao's works is forgetting one's roots. Later, he studied hard and tried to change himself, quickly transforming. He deeply felt: "Revolution without studying Chairman Mao's works won't do, studying Chairman Mao's works without deep class feelings won't do, studying Chairman Mao's works without fighting hard against the 'self' won't do."

Second, we received the most profound and practical class and class struggle education, our love and hate became clearer, and we held our guns tighter.

Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." Without a class standpoint, there is no correct direction; without a class standpoint, one cannot truly serve the people; without a class standpoint, one cannot hold the gun tightly.

Before going to the countryside, most units conducted socialist education. This time, everyone said it was a continuation and deepening of socialist education. Every time we went to a village, we visited the poor and held bitter-sweet remembrance meetings. Many poor and lower-middle peasants who suffered greatly in the old society pointed to the big locust tree where their father hanged himself, the old temple platform where their mother starved to death, and the scars where they were bitten by the landlord's dogs, bitterly denouncing the tragic experiences of the old society and enthusiastically talking about the happy life in the new society. This not only raised the class consciousness of the people but also triggered the cadres and soldiers' memories of their own painful family histories, deepening their love for the Party and Chairman Mao. Many soldiers said when talking about the old society: "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, I will never forget class bitterness, never forget class struggle, and always listen to Chairman Mao's words." The word "class" was deeply engraved in the minds of the broad cadres and soldiers.

In the propaganda activities, the cadres and soldiers also saw and heard the evil activities of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. "After the enemies with guns were eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." Everyone understood Chairman Mao's instructions more deeply and had a clearer understanding of the new situation and characteristics of class struggle in the socialist period. The soldiers said: "The class enemies who have been overthrown are 'smiling on the face but hating in the heart, smiling to your face but stabbing you in the back.'" The new soldiers who originally thought that class enemies dared not speak or act also understood that the domestic class enemies were now "not moving openly but secretly, looking for agents everywhere." After the cadres and soldiers strengthened their class struggle consciousness and enhanced their ability to resist the peaceful evolution of the bourgeoisie, they held their guns tighter and expressed their determination to carry guns for the revolution and the people for life, defending Chairman Mao and the iron-clad proletarian state to the death.

Third, we received the most profound and practical education on the people's army ideology, further firming up our resolve to serve the people wholeheartedly.

Chairman Mao said: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the only purpose of this army." The cadres and soldiers understood Chairman Mao's instructions more deeply through this propaganda activity.

Every time we went to a place, the people treated us like long-lost relatives, loving and caring for us. Women competed to wash the soldiers' clothes. Old women insisted on putting cooked eggs in the soldiers' pockets. They said: "We have been waiting for you." They welcomed us when we arrived and bid us farewell with tears when we left. An old man who was blind in both eyes also had someone support him to the soldiers, touching them up and down and saying excitedly: "I can't see you, but just hearing your voices makes me feel comfortable." Countless moving facts made all the cadres and soldiers receive a very profound education on the glorious tradition of the army uniting with the people and a very vivid education on serving the people wholeheartedly. The soldiers said: "The army is like a fish, and the people are like water. The fish can never leave the water." "The more we serve the people, the more the people will love us; the more we serve the people completely and thoroughly, the more the people will love us without limit." Many soldiers, in the propaganda activities, did not fear high mountains and long roads, braved the wind and rain, and went wherever there were people to spread Mao Zedong Thought. Many soldiers, when helping the people with labor, had their hands full of blisters, did not complain, did not cry out in pain, and were content to be the people's "old yellow ox." Everyone expressed: "In the future, we will do whatever the Party asks us to do. As long as it is beneficial to the people, even if it means climbing mountains of knives and wading through seas of fire, we will go!"

Fourth, we received a profound education on the people's war ideology, firming up our belief in victory.

Chairman Mao said: "What is the true iron wall? It is the people, the millions and millions of people who truly support the revolution." "Mobilizing the people of the whole country creates a vast ocean that drowns the enemy, creates the conditions to make up for the lack of weapons and other things, and creates the premise to overcome all difficulties in war."

Originally, some comrades did not fully understand the great significance of the whole people being armed. This time, in the countryside, the people gave a vivid lesson. They personally saw Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" being grasped by the peasants, not only inspiring the spirit of self-reliance and fighting against nature, but also enhancing the war preparedness consciousness. Military training intensified, and militia work became more active. The poor and lower-middle peasants told the soldiers: "Our children are all soldiers, and as many as needed will go to war." "As long as we have food, our army will have food." Xingtai Beizhuang is a remote mountain village with only nine households. When the soldiers arrived, the old party branch secretary held the soldiers' hands and said: "The mountain people have not forgotten our old Eighth Route Army. When the war comes, don't look at our village being small, if a few dozen enemies come, we will smash them to pieces with pickaxes." The cadres and soldiers received profound education from the people's words and deeds, feeling that they had a strong backing, and actively organized the militia to study Chairman Mao's works in every village, enthusiastically helping the militia improve their skills in killing the enemy. The soldiers said confidently: With the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely drown all the enemies who dare to invade in the vast ocean of the whole people being armed.

Fifth, we further carried forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle of our army.

Chairman Mao taught us: "We must make our comrades continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle." The cadres and soldiers, through laboring, living, and heart-to-heart talks with the poor and lower-middle peasants, not only saw the poor and lower-middle peasants' noble quality of devoting themselves to the revolution but also saw their simple and frugal laboring people's nature, engraving the image of the poor and lower-middle peasants in their minds.

Many soldiers and some cadres from the cities, through this propaganda activity, had a great change in their thoughts and feelings, always comparing their living standards with those of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some people, to remember the poor and lower-middle peasants' nature, proposed a "four seasons, four thoughts": when eating in the canteen, think about what the poor and lower-middle peasants eat; when issuing clothes, think about what the poor and lower-middle peasants wear; when encountering difficulties, think about how the poor and lower-middle peasants deal with the earthquake disaster; when encountering personal problems, think about how the poor and lower-middle peasants deal with the collective. The cadres and soldiers, with the poor and lower-middle peasants as their examples, further carried forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle and sharing weal and woe with the people, and will never leave the people and always unite with the people.

A large number of facts made us deeply realize: going to the countryside, promoting Mao Zedong Thought among the people, is not only the need of the times and the revolution but also the need of the army's revolutionary construction. We must be more conscious of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, always be propagators and sowers of Mao Zedong Thought, more actively and enthusiastically promote Mao Zedong Thought among the people, participate in the three great revolutionary practices, and strive to implement Chairman Mao's military thoughts and build the army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    宣传群众　教育自己
    ——在邢台地区向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想的体会
    人民解放军某部政治部
    新华社编者按：毛主席在人民解放军应该是一个大学校的指示中说：这个大学校，又能从事群众工作，参加工厂、农村的社会主义教育运动；社会主义教育运动完了，随时都有群众工作可做，使军民永远打成一片……。人民解放军某部和兄弟部队一起开赴遭受严重地震灾害的邢台地区，做毛泽东思想的宣传队、播种机，满腔热情地向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，就是遵循毛主席的教导，加强群众工作，取得显著成绩的一个出色的范例。他们在灾区，既用毛泽东思想武装了人民群众，发动了人民群众，战胜了地震灾害；又大大提高了广大指战员的思想水平，有效地促进了部队的思想革命化。同时，军队和人民用伟大的毛泽东思想紧紧联结在一起，更加亲密团结、更好地打成一片了。
    坚决执行毛主席关于人民解放军是一座大学校的指示，加强群众工作，永远和人民群众打成一片，最重要的是向群众广泛宣传毛泽东思想，帮助群众活学活用毛主席著作，走到哪里宣传到哪里，让毛泽东思想在人民群众的头脑里深深扎根。林彪同志说：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”又说：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”我们一定要遵照林彪同志的指示，永远当好毛泽东思想的宣传队、播种机。
    宣传群众，教育自己。毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”在新的历史时期，走出营房，到三大革命实践中去，从宣传毛泽东思想中学习毛泽东思想尤为重要。这个部队的实践证明，这次宣传使指战员受到了一次最实际、最生动、最深刻的阶级教育、人民军队教育、人民战争教育；也找到了如何发扬我军和人民群众打成一片的光荣传统，贯彻林彪同志“虚心向地方学习”的指示，自觉接受地方党委领导，接受人民群众监督等方面的一些新的途径。
    让我们的军队和一些有条件的学校、机关等，都遵照毛主席的教导，当毛泽东思想的宣传队、播种机，经常向人民群众宣传伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想吧！
    今年四五月间，我们和兄弟部队一起，组成万人宣传队，向邢台地区广大人民宣传毛泽东思想。一个多月的实践证明：向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，不仅改变了劳动人民的精神面貌，使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量，而且教育了自己，有效地促进了部队的思想革命化。
    毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”我们遵循毛主席的教导，走出营房，到群众中去，到三大革命实践中去学习、锻炼，宣传毛泽东思想，使部队受到了一次最实际、最生动、最深刻的毛泽东思想教育。军队做群众工作，是毛主席为我军规定的三大任务之一。军队向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，是最重要最根本的群众工作。这次我们到农村去，到群众斗争的大风大浪中去宣传毛泽东思想，是我军军民一致光荣传统的大发扬；是突出政治五项原则落实的新战场；是向地方人民群众学习，促进部队思想革命化的大课堂；也是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，从根本上提高部队战斗力的重要措施。
    宣传群众，教育自己。我们在这次宣传中，受教育最深，收获最大的有如下五点：
    一、进一步增强了学习毛主席著作的阶级感情和在“用”字上狠下功夫的自觉性
    要宣传群众，首先要教育自己。要用毛泽东思想回答人民群众的问题，先要用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑；要人民群众按毛主席的教导去做，自己必先要执行毛主席的指示。这样，道理才能讲透，说话才有力量。这次，我们事先反复学习了毛主席著作，重温了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》。宣传过程中，我们处处以毛主席的书作为一切行动的指导方针，反复学，反复用。讲一堂课，为人民群众解决一个问题，都是一学再学，一用再用。这样，有力地促进了指战员们活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫的自觉性。
    在宣传活动中，人民群众对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜，毛泽东思想的无穷威力，也使广大指战员受到极为深刻的教育。我们从宣传中，深深地体会到，毛泽东思想的光辉照到那里，那里就出现崭新的面貌。在灾害面前，一读毛主席的书，人们就精神焕发；在困难面前，一讲毛主席著作，人们就看到光明，勇往直前。一些不安心农业劳动的青年，听了毛主席的话，立志在农村扎根，为革命种田；一些不下地、不开会、不学习的妇女，听了毛主席的话，扛起锄头下地了，开会必到，学习毛主席著作更是积极。无数的生动事实，使全体指战员们深深感到：“毛主席的话，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。”
    宣传群众，教育自己。指战员们在紧张的宣传活动中，更加自觉地学习毛主席著作，更加自觉地在“用”字上狠下功夫。许多人天天过“电影”，想想一天的活动，那些符合毛主席思想，那些做得还不够，处处严格要求自己。整个部队先进的更先进，后进的赶了上来。有个后进战士过去认为“不学毛主席著作也变不了质”，到农村后，广大贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作的生动事例，使他认识到不好好学习毛主席著作是忘了本。以后，他加紧学习，努力改造自己，很快有了转变。他深有体会地说：干革命不学毛主席著作不行，学习毛主席著作没有深厚的阶级感情不行，学习毛主席著作不狠斗“我”字不行。
    二、受到最深刻、最实际的阶级和阶级斗争的教育，爱憎更加分明，枪杆子握得更紧了
    毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”没有阶级观点，就没有正确方向；没有阶级观点，就不能真正为人民服务；没有阶级观点，就不能握紧枪杆子。
    到农村之前，多数部队进行了社会主义教育。这次，大家说是社会主义教育的继续和加深。我们每到一村，都访贫问苦，组织忆苦思甜会。许多在旧社会苦大仇深的贫下中农，手指着父亲吊死的大槐树，母亲饿死的旧庙台，自己被地主狗咬的伤疤，满腔悲愤地控诉了旧社会悲惨遭遇，畅谈了新社会的幸福生活。这样，既提高了人民群众的无产阶级觉悟，又触发了指战员们对自己苦痛家史的回忆，加深了对党和毛主席的热爱。许多战士一谈到旧社会就说：爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，我永远不忘阶级苦，永远不忘阶级斗争，永远听毛主席的话。“阶级”二字在广大干部战士头脑里刻得更深了。
    在宣传活动中，指战员们还耳闻目睹了地、富、反、坏、右的罪恶活动。“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”大家对毛主席这一教导领会得更深刻了，对社会主义时期阶级斗争的新形势、新特点认识得也更清楚了。战士们说：被打倒了的阶级敌人是“笑在脸上，恨在心里，当面见你一笑，背后给你一刀。”原来认为阶级敌人不敢说不敢动的新战士，也懂得了国内的阶级敌人，现在是“明里不动暗里动，到处在找代理人”。指战员们增强了阶级斗争观念，增强了抵制资产阶级“和平演变”的能力以后，枪杆子握得更紧了，纷纷表示要为革命为人民扛一辈子枪，誓死保卫毛主席，保卫无产阶级铁打的江山。
    三、受到最深刻、最实际的人民军队思想的教育，进一步坚定了全心全意为人民服务的思想
    毛主席说：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”指战员们通过这次宣传活动对毛主席这一教导理解更深了。
    我们每到一地，人民群众对我们像久别重逢的亲人，无限爱戴，无限关怀。妇女们争着给战士洗衣服。老大娘把煮熟的鸡蛋硬塞在战士的口袋里。他们说：“可把你们盼来了。”来时欢迎，走时依依不舍，挥泪告别。一位双目失明的老人，还叫人扶着到战士跟前，摸上摸下激动地说：“我看不见你们，听听你们的话音也觉得舒坦。”无数感人肺腑的事实，使全体指战员受到一次极为深刻的军民一致的光荣传统教育，一次极为生动的全心全意为人民服务的教育。战士们说：“军队好比鱼，人民好比水，鱼儿永远离不开水。”“我们多为人民服务一分，人民会更热爱我们一分；我们完全彻底地为人民服务，人民就会无限地热爱我们。”许多战士在宣传活动中，不怕山高路远，顶风冒雨，哪里有人民，就把毛泽东思想传播到哪里。许多战士在帮助群众劳动时，双手打满了泡，不叫苦，不喊疼，甘当人民的“老黄牛”。大家纷纷表示：“今后党让干啥就干啥，只要对人民有利的事，就是上刀山，下火海，也要去！”
    四、受到深刻的人民战争思想的教育，坚定了必胜信念
    毛主席说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”“动员了全国的老百姓，就造成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海，造成了弥补武器等等缺陷的补救条件，造成了克服一切战争困难的前提。”
    原来有的同志对全民皆兵的伟大意义认识不足，这次在农村，人民群众给上了生动的一课。他们亲自看到毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略思想，被农民所掌握，不仅焕发了自力更生，战天斗地的革命精神，而且增强了战备观念。民兵训练加紧了，民兵工作更加活跃了。贫下中农对战士们说：“咱们贫下中农的孩子都是兵，打起仗来需要多少去多少。”“只要咱们有吃的，就有咱们军队吃的。”邢台北于庄是个只有九户人家的偏僻山村，战士们一到，老支部书记拉着战士的手说：“山区人民没有忘记咱们老八路，打起仗来别看咱村小，来几十个敌人，用镐头也砸它个稀巴烂。”指战员们从人民群众的一言一行中，受到了深刻的教育，觉得身后有强大的后盾，每到一村都积极组织民兵学习毛主席著作，热情帮助民兵提高杀敌本领。战士们信心百倍地说：有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民，一定会把一切敢于来犯的敌人淹没在全民皆兵的汪洋大海里。
    五、进一步发扬了我军艰苦奋斗的革命传统
    毛主席教导我们：“务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”指战员们通过与贫下中农同劳动，同生活，促膝谈心，不仅看到了贫下中农一心为革命的高贵品质，而且看到了他们艰苦朴素、克勤克俭的劳动人民本色，脑子里刻上了贫下中农的英雄形象。
    许多来自城市的战士和一部分干部，通过这次宣传活动，思想感情起了很大变化，处处向贫下中农的生活水平看齐。有些人为了不忘贫下中农本色，提出一个“四时四想”：进食堂时，想贫下中农吃的什么；发衣服时，想贫下中农穿的什么；遇到困难时，想贫下中农怎样对待地震灾害的；遇到个人问题时，想贫下中农怎样对待集体的。指战员们以贫下中农为榜样，进一步发扬艰苦奋斗、与人民群众同甘共苦的革命传统，就会永远不脱离群众，永远和人民打成一片。
    大量的事实，使我们深刻地认识到：到农村去，向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，这不但是时代的需要，革命的需要，也是我军革命化建设的需要。我们一定要更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，永远做毛泽东思想的宣传队、播种机，更加积极热情地向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，参加三大革命实践，为坚决贯彻毛主席的建军思想，把部队办成毛泽东思想的大学校而奋斗！
