Today, the public security police of the capital have all changed into new uniforms they have long been looking forward to. They said: Changing into new uniforms is the greatest care from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the greatest trust from the masses. The Red Guards and revolutionary masses of the capital have been congratulating them one after another, hoping that they will become Chairman Mao's Red Guards, remain red forever, and always be red. The broad masses of public security police have expressed that they will definitely learn from the People's Liberation Army and turn the public security police force into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The seventy public security police officers of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau's Traffic Second Squad, after getting off work at nine o'clock this evening, immediately started writing reports of joy, lining up in neat rows, and beating drums and gongs to go to the masses' reception station of the Party Central Committee to report the good news. Holding the red and shining "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they stood in front of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao at the reception station, expressing their determination to take the People's Liberation Army as an example, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, to turn the public security police force into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, to be forever loyal to the people, to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to Mao Zedong Thought! They shouted: "Defend the Party Central Committee to the death!" "Defend Chairman Mao to the death!"

    红卫兵和革命群众纷纷祝贺，期望他们作毛主席的红卫兵，红到底，永远红。广大民警表示，一定要学习解放军，把民警队伍办成毛泽东思想的大学校
    据新华社一日讯　今天，首都的人民警察都换上了早就盼望的新服装。他们说：改换新服装，是党中央、毛主席对我们的最大关怀，是人民群众对我们的最大信任。首都的红卫兵和革命群众纷纷向他们祝贺，期望他们作毛主席的红卫兵，红到底，永远红。广大民警表示，一定要学习解放军，把民警队伍办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    北京市公安局交通二中队的七十名民警，今晚九点钟一下班，就忙着写喜报，排着整齐的队伍，敲锣打鼓去党中央的群众接待站报喜。他们手里拿着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，在接待站的毛主席巨幅像前，表示决心以解放军为榜样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，把人民警察队伍办成毛泽东思想的大学校，永远忠于人民，忠于党，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想！他们高呼：“誓死保卫党中央！”“誓死保卫毛主席！”
