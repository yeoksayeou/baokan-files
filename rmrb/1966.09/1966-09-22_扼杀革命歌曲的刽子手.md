Title: The Executioner of Revolutionary Songs
Author: Lín Mòhán

Edition: 6

Lín Mòhán has always harbored hostility towards revolutionary songs. He once vehemently criticized revolutionary songs, saying, “Listening to you sing slogans is no better than reading the newspaper!” He consistently rejected and suppressed revolutionary songs, instead advocating for bourgeois light music and sentimental songs. He propagated bourgeois decadent thoughts, using bourgeois decadent music to attack the proletariat. Under the guise of relaxation, joy, beauty, and enjoyment, he allowed bourgeois ideology to occupy the ground, preparing the spiritual groundwork for the restoration of capitalism.

On January 11, 1961, at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Propaganda Department, Lín Mòhán viciously slandered revolutionary songs, accusing them of numerous crimes. He went to great lengths to defame revolutionary songs, claiming that the lyrics were “empty and generic,” “pieced together from various sources, all sounding the same,” “clichéd and dull,” “repetitive and uninspiring,” “unable to stir the composer's emotions,” “just headlines and newspaper jargon,” “only superficial descriptions of life, even vulgar,” “political jargon, not art,” “lacking both life and imagery,” and “lacking both thought and emotion.”

He also claimed that the melodies of revolutionary songs were “banal and monotonous,” “unoriginal,” “stuck in the language of the war of resistance,” “repetitive and lacking individuality,” “lacking new elements and creativity,” “lacking character and artistry,” “lacking passion,” and “lacking thought and emotion.” And so on, the list goes on.

Lín Mòhán's brazen and vicious attacks on revolutionary songs exposed his hatred for the socialist system as a counter-revolutionary revisionist.

Lín Mòhán particularly hated songs like “March Forward, Work Hard,” “Praise the General Line,” “People's Communes Are Good,” “Long Live the Great Leap Forward,” “Red Flags Flying,” and “Thank the Party for Its Good Leadership, Thank Chairman Mao for His Wise Arrangements.” He slandered these as “overused terms.” However, it is precisely these revolutionary songs that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers love to listen to and sing. Lín Mòhán is the executioner of revolutionary songs, and we must not let his schemes succeed! The more he tries to prevent us from singing loudly in praise of our great leader, the great party, and the three red banners, the more we must sing passionately! Let us drown out Lín Mòhán and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the waves of revolutionary songs from the masses!

    扼杀革命歌曲的刽子手
    林默涵一贯仇视革命歌曲，曾经破口大骂革命歌曲是：“听你唱口号，不如去看报！”他处处排斥和打击革命歌曲，却一味提倡资产阶级的轻音乐、抒情歌曲，大肆宣扬资产阶级腐朽思想，用资产阶级靡靡之音来向无产阶级进攻，在轻松、愉快、美感、享受的幌子下，让资产阶级思想占领阵地，为资本主义复辟作精神准备。
    一九六一年一月十一日，林默涵在中共中央宣传部的一次会议上，穷凶极恶地给革命歌曲安上了许多罪名，他挖空心思地污蔑革命歌曲，胡说什么革命歌曲的歌词是：“空洞，一般化”“东拼西凑，千篇一律”“陈词滥调，枯燥无味”“翻来复去，打不动人心”“唤不起作曲家的情感”“是报纸的标题，报纸名词的堆砌”“只写生活表面，甚至庸俗化”“是政治术语，不是艺术”“既没生活，又无形象”“既没思想，又无感情”。
    他还胡说什么革命歌曲的曲调是：“平庸单调”“不新颖”“老是抗战时期的语言”“老是重复，缺乏个性”“没有新因素，没有创造性”“没有特色，没有艺术”“没有冲动”“没有思想感情”。如此等等，不一而足。
    林默涵这样放肆、刻毒地攻击革命歌曲，正好暴露了他这个反革命修正主义分子对社会主义制度的仇恨。
    林默涵最仇视：“向前进、鼓干劲”、“歌颂总路线”、“人民公社好”、“大跃进万岁”、“红旗飘飘”、“感谢党的好领导，感谢毛主席巧安排”等革命歌词，他污蔑这是“用滥了的术语”。但是，我们广大工农兵群众恰恰是最爱听、最爱唱这样的革命歌曲。林默涵是扼杀革命歌曲的刽子手，我们决不能让他的阴谋得逞！他越是不准我们放声歌颂伟大的领袖、伟大的党，歌颂三面红旗，我们越是要尽情歌唱！把林默涵等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，淹没在革命群众歌曲的声浪之中！
