One year ago, Comrade Lin Biao published the famous article "Long Live the Victory of People's War." This article provides a comprehensive, systematic, and profound analysis of Comrade Mao Zedong's theory and strategic thought on people's war, offering a powerful ideological weapon for the world's revolutionary people to oppose imperialism and modern revisionism. It dealt a heavy blow to the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, greatly boosting the morale of the people of various countries in their struggle for freedom and liberation. The publication of this article has immense historical and international significance.

Currently, the struggle between more than 90 percent of the world's people and U.S. imperialism is a decisive battle between revolution and counter-revolution, a battle between the socialist system and the capitalist-imperialist system, and a battle between Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary military strategy based on people's war and the reactionary military strategy of imperialism based on weaponry.

All reactionaries, including U.S. imperialism, wage wars that are anti-people. In war, they cannot rely on people but must rely on weapons, thus inevitably exaggerating and idolizing the role of weapons. This weaponry-centric view determines their strong-arm tactics, opportunism, and pragmatism in war. They advance when they see an opportunity and retreat when they encounter difficulty. They bully the weak and fear the strong. If you are weak, they become strong; if you are strong, they become weak. The more you fear them, the more arrogant they become, demanding more and more; the less you fear them and the more resolutely you fight them, the more helpless they become. Their exploitative nature often makes them blinded by greed, unable and unwilling to correctly assess the objective balance of power and understand the laws of war development. In strategic decision-making and war direction, they cannot but be subjective idealists. They always overestimate their own strength and underestimate the people's strength, making one mistake after another that cannot be rectified, and they will never be able to correct these mistakes.

The United States, the largest military imperialist power, has produced and stockpiled a large number of nuclear weapons over the past 21 years. It uses its enormous economic power and modern science and technology to frantically develop weapons of mass destruction, while in military thought, it combines weaponry-centrism, strong-arm tactics, pragmatism, opportunism, and subjective idealism. The first country to develop nuclear weapons, U.S. imperialism, has become a slave to nuclear weapons in military thought. After World War II, although the U.S. military strategy has undergone several changes, relying on nuclear blackmail has been consistent throughout each military strategy. The absurdity and ridiculousness of U.S. imperialism's weaponry-centric military thought surpass that of all reactionaries in history and contemporary times.

After developing the first atomic bomb 21 years ago, U.S. imperialists thought that "from now on, the use or threat of use of large-scale destructive atomic weapons" would be enough to guarantee U.S. hegemony in the world. However, the victory of the Chinese revolution, the victory of the Korean War against U.S. aggression, the current victorious development of the Vietnamese War against U.S. aggression, and the victorious development of revolutionary struggles in many Asian, African, and Latin American countries have all declared the bankruptcy of U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary military strategy based on nuclear blackmail.

In 1959, 14 years after the first U.S. atomic bomb explosion, General Taylor, a loyal servant of Wall Street, finally realized that the concept of "atomic weapons deciding everything" was a "completely wrong view" and proposed the "flexible response" strategy as a lifeline for U.S. imperialism. Although Taylor saw the error of the "massive retaliation" strategy that mainly relied on strategic nuclear weapons, the new strategy he proposed was still based on weaponry-centrism, relying on so-called "sea and air superiority," so-called "high-efficiency conventional weapons," and other weapon advantages, and still used the threat of nuclear war as the pillar and backbone of this new strategy. Therefore, when faced with revolutionary people who fear neither heaven nor earth, who fear neither hardship nor death, this strategy has no way out and can no longer be effective.

As for the "gradual escalation" strategy that has emerged in the past two years to boost the "flexible response" strategy, it is even more inseparable from nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats, completely a strategy of gamblers and hooligans playing tough, a strategy of pure opportunism and pragmatism. Its characteristic is that it wants to shout loudly about expanding the war, waving nuclear weapons to scare people, but it is also afraid that once the war expands, it will cause big trouble and the situation will be difficult to control. It talks about both going up the ladder and coming down the ladder. If expanding the war is not to its advantage, or if the other side does not fall for it, it can also play the role of a "bachelor not eating the loss in front of him," making up a story to "save face," and coming down the ladder itself. This fully exposes its paper tiger nature of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

The experience of the Chinese people and the people of various countries in their long struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys proves that Comrade Mao Zedong's revolutionary military strategy of people's war is the only correct and victorious strategy for the oppressed people to defeat all enemies.

Comrade Mao Zedong's military strategic thought of people's war is based on thorough historical materialism and dialectical materialism. People are the creators of world history, which is a fundamental principle of Marxism. Comrade Mao Zedong creatively applied this principle to war, believing that weapons play an important role in war but are not decisive. The fundamental factor determining the outcome of war is people, not weapons. Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses can war be waged and won.

From this guiding ideology, we believe that the best weapons are not airplanes, cannons, tanks, atomic bombs, and other killing tools, but Mao Zedong Thought; the greatest combat effectiveness is not the power of any new weapons, but the people who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

From this guiding ideology, we can despise any powerful enemy strategically but take them seriously tactically; we can most correctly estimate the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves, most cleverly utilize all contradictions within the enemy, and to the greatest extent, combine the army with the people, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the people, implement strategic superiority and tactical inferiority, flexibly and maneuverably avoid the enemy's strengths and strike at their weaknesses; we can concentrate superior forces to fight annihilation battles, divide the enemy and eat them one by one; we can fully mobilize the wisdom of soldiers and the masses, fight more skillfully, gain more experience, become smarter, and become stronger, until we fundamentally change the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves and completely and thoroughly annihilate them.

Once this revolutionary military strategy is grasped by the people and combined with the masses, it becomes an invincible force that will ultimately bury U.S. imperialism and all its lackeys, and liberate the oppressed people.

Contrary to the expectations of all reactionaries, the appearance of nuclear weapons cannot save the bankruptcy of weaponry-centrism. The more the imperialists threaten with nuclear war, the more brilliant and skillful the revolutionary people's war becomes. The current victorious anti-U.S. war being waged by the Vietnamese people provides a new example of the "weak" defeating the "strong" and a living example of the people defeating U.S. imperialism's anti-people war through people's war.

As Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in "Long Live the Victory of People's War": "People's war is the most effective weapon against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. All revolutionary people in the world will learn to use people's war against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, from having no weapons to taking up weapons, from not knowing how to fight to learning how to fight, from not being good at people's war to being good at people's war. U.S. imperialism, this wild bull that runs amok everywhere, will eventually be burned to ashes in the people's war it itself ignited."

    人民的革命战略必将战胜美帝的反革命战略
    ——为纪念林彪同志《人民战争胜利万岁》一文发表一周年而作
    东明
    一年以前，林彪同志发表了《人民战争胜利万岁》这篇著名的文章。这篇文章，对毛泽东同志的人民战争的理论和战略思想作了全面的、系统的、深刻的分析，给全世界革命人民提供了反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器。它沉重地打击了美帝国主义及其走狗的威风，大大鼓舞了各国人民争取自由解放的斗志。这篇文章的发表，具有极其伟大的历史意义和国际意义。
    目前全世界百分之九十以上人民同美帝国主义之间进行的大搏斗，是一场决定世界前途的革命与反革命的决战，是社会主义同资本帝国主义两种制度的决战，也是以人民战争为基础的毛泽东同志的革命军事战略，同以唯武器论为基础的帝国主义的反动军事战略的决战。
    一切反动派，包括美帝国主义在内，他们所从事的战争是反人民的。他们在战争中不能依靠人而只能依靠武器，因此就必然要片面地夸大和迷信武器的作用。这种唯武器论，决定了他们在战争实践中的强权主义、机会主义和实用主义的态度。他们总是见可而进，知难而退，软的欺，硬的怕。你软他就硬，你硬他就软。你越怕他，他越威风，越要得寸进尺；你越不怕他，坚决同他斗，他就毫无办法。他们的剥削阶级本性，常常使他们利令智昏，不愿意也不可能正确估计客观的力量对比，认识战争的发展规律。他们在战略决策和战争指导上不能不是主观唯心主义的。他们总是过高地估计自己的力量而过低地估计人民的力量，犯下一个又一个无法挽回的错误，而且永远也无法改正这些错误。
    美国这个最大的军事帝国主义，二十一年来，生产和储备了大量的核武器。它利用自己庞大的经济力量和现代科学技术，拚命发展杀人武器，同时也就在军事思想上，集唯武器论、强权主义、实用主义、机会主义和主观唯心主义之大成。第一个造出了核武器的美帝国主义，在军事思想上完全成了核武器的奴仆。第二次世界大战以后，美国的军事战略虽然几经变化，但是依靠核武器进行核讹诈，却是始终如一，贯串于每一个军事战略之中。美帝国主义唯武器论的军事思想之荒谬和可笑，超过了历史上以及和它同时代的一切反动派。
    美帝国主义在二十一年前造出第一颗原子弹之后，他们满以为“从今以后，使用或威胁使用具有大规模毁灭性的原子武器”，就足以保证美国在世界的霸权了。但是，中国革命的胜利，朝鲜抗美战争的胜利，当前越南抗美战争的胜利发展，以及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲许多国家革命斗争的胜利发展，都宣告了美帝国主义以核讹诈为基础的反革命军事战略的破产。
    一九五九年，在美国第一颗原子弹爆炸之后的十四年，华尔街的忠实奴仆泰勒将军终于发现了这种“原子武器能决定一切”的概念是一种“大错特错的见解”，并且提出了“灵活反应”战略，作为美帝国主义的救命药方。泰勒虽然看到了主要依靠战略核武器的“大规模报复”战略的错误，但是，他所提出的新战略也还是建立在唯武器论的基础之上的，还是依靠所谓“海空优势”、所谓“高效率的常规武器”等等武器优势，而且仍然是以核战争的威胁作为这种新战略的支柱和后盾。因此，这种战略一遇到不怕天，不怕地，不怕苦，不怕死的革命人民，就只好一筹莫展了，就再也无所施其技了。
    至于最近两年出笼的，为“灵活反应”战略打强心针的“逐步升级”战略，就更是离不开核讹诈和核威胁，完全是一种赌棍、流氓耍无赖的战略，是一种十足的机会主义、实用主义的战略。它的特点是，既要大叫大嚷扩大战争，挥舞着核武器吓人，又生怕一旦战争扩大起来，闯出大乱子，局势不好收拾。它既讲上梯子，也讲下梯子，一旦扩大战争对它不利，或者对方不吃这一套，它也可以来一个“光棍不吃眼前亏”，编一个“保全面子”的话头，自己下楼梯。这就十足地暴露出了它外强中干的纸老虎本质。
    中国和各国革命人民同美帝国主义及其走狗进行长期搏斗的经验证明，毛泽东同志创造的人民战争的革命军事战略，是被压迫人民战胜一切敌人的唯一正确的致胜战略。
    毛泽东同志的人民战争的军事战略思想，是建立在彻底的历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义的基础上的。人民是创造世界历史的动力，这是马克思主义的一条根本原理。毛泽东同志创造性地运用这个原理于战争，认为武器在战争中有其重要的作用，但不起决定的作用，决定战争胜负的根本因素是人而不是武器。革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众、依靠群众，才能进行战争和赢得战争。
    从这一指导思想出发，我们认为，最好的武器不是飞机、大炮、坦克、原子弹之类的杀人玩艺，而是毛泽东思想；最大的战斗力不是任何新式武器的威力，而是用毛泽东思想武装起来的觉悟了的人民。
    从这一指导思想出发，我们对任何强大的敌人，都能够在战略上藐视之，而在战术上重视之；能够最正确地估计敌我力量的对比，最巧妙地利用敌人内部的一切矛盾；能够最大限度地实行军队和人民的结合，最大限度地调动人民群众的积极性，实行战略上的以一当十和战术上的以十当一，灵活机动地避敌之长而击敌之短；能够集中优势兵力打歼灭战，把敌人分割开来一口一口吃掉；能够充分发挥战士和人民群众的智慧，越打越有办法，越打越有经验，越打越聪明，越打越强大，直到从根本上改变敌我力量对比而彻底全部干净地歼灭之。
    这种革命的军事战略一旦为人民所掌握，同群众相结合，就成为无敌的力量，就必将最后埋葬美帝国主义及其一切走狗，而使被压迫人民赢得真正的解放。
    同一切反动派的预料相反，核武器的出现，并不能挽救唯武器论的破产。越是面对着帝国主义的核战争威胁，革命的人民战争就越是大放异彩、大显身手。当前越南人民正在胜利进行的抗美战争，给我们提供了一个“弱者”能够战胜“强者”的新的范例，提供了一个人民能够依靠人民战争打败美帝国主义的反人民战争的最活生生的榜样。
    正如林彪同志在《人民战争胜利万岁》中所指出的：“人民战争是对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。全世界革命人民，都将学会用人民战争来对付美帝国主义及其走狗，都将从没有武器到拿起武器，从不会打仗到学会打仗，从不善于进行人民战争到善于进行人民战争。美帝国主义这只到处乱闯的野牛，终将在它自己点燃起来的人民战争的烈火中被烧成灰烬。”
