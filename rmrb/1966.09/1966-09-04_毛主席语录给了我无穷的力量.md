Miner He Zhenyang is like the unsetting sun, radiating golden light; the Chairman Mao quotation board hangs high above the working face. Whenever I come here, it feels like I am standing guard by Chairman Mao's side; my blood boils in my chest, and my passion surges like the roaring Yangtze River! Facing the hard rock layers, I make the pneumatic drill roar; my ideals spin with the drill bit, and my youth shines on the rocks! The pneumatic drill in my hands sings joyfully, my spirits are high and my enthusiasm is boundless. If you ask where my boundless enthusiasm comes from? Chairman Mao's quotations have given me limitless strength!

    毛主席语录给了我无穷的力量
    矿工　贺振扬像不落的太阳，闪射着金色的光芒；毛主席语录板，高高挂在掌子面上。每当我来到这里，就像守卫在毛主席身旁；热血在心头翻滚，激情像奔腾的长江！面对着坚硬的矿层，我把风钻开得呜呜响；理想伴着钻杆飞转，青春在岩石上闪光！手下的风钻，欢腾地歌唱，我心情舒畅干劲长，要问冲天干劲哪里来？毛主席语录给了我无穷的力量！
