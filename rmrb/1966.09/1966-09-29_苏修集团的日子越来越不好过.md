The communiqué of the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party points out: "The new leadership of the CPSU, inheriting the legacy of Khrushchev, is carrying out Khrushchev-style revisionism without Khrushchev. They are joining forces with imperialism led by the United States and reactionaries of various countries to form a new holy alliance against communism, the people, revolution, and China. However, this counter-revolutionary holy alliance is doomed to fail and is already falling apart."

Just like U.S. imperialism, the days of Soviet modern revisionism are getting worse. Under the continuous exposure and struggle of Marxist-Leninists worldwide, the Soviet revisionist clique and its cohorts are facing unprecedented isolation. The revolutionary people of the world are increasingly recognizing that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose modern revisionism, and there is no middle ground. One cannot engage in any "joint actions" with the CPSU leadership.

Since this year, the new leadership of the CPSU has intensified its implementation of Khrushchev-style revisionism without Khrushchev, going further down the path of betraying Marxism-Leninism and capitulating to U.S. imperialism than Khrushchev did. They are hastening to collude with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of various countries, forging a new holy alliance against communism, the people, revolution, and China. They are adapting to the U.S. global strategy of shifting its focus to the East, reaching a tacit agreement with the U.S. in Europe to freeze the status quo, allowing the U.S. to withdraw troops from Western Europe to confront the peoples of Vietnam, Indochina, and China. On the Vietnam issue, they are doing everything they can to serve the U.S.'s "peace talks" deception, attempting to help the U.S. aggressors extinguish the blazing flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Within and outside the United Nations, the new CPSU leadership is intensifying its filthy political deals with the U.S., selling out the interests of the peoples of various countries. They are even more brazenly engaging in the evil acts of splitting, sabotaging, and overthrowing Marxist-Leninist brother parties and revolutionary factions of various countries. They are even more rampant in pushing for the restoration of capitalism at home. The activities of the new CPSU leadership further expose them as incorrigible traitors and the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

The backward and reactionary actions of the CPSU leadership, both domestically and internationally, completely go against the fundamental interests of the Soviet people and the people of the world, and are facing increasingly strong opposition from the revolutionary people at home and abroad. Within the modern revisionist clique, there are also numerous contradictions. The hegemonic position of the new CPSU leadership is increasingly weakened, and their command stick is becoming less effective. Despite the CPSU leadership's efforts to maintain appearances, they cannot hide the various sharp contradictions and serious difficulties they are facing both domestically and internationally. Like U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is also a very weak paper tiger.

### 苏修集团的日子越来越不好过

    苏修集团的日子越来越不好过
    党的八届十一中全会公报指出：“苏共新领导集团，继承赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，实行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义。……他们正在联合以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派，结成一个反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的新神圣同盟。可是，这种反革命的神圣同盟，是注定要破产的，现在已经陷于分崩离析。”
    苏联现代修正主义，同美帝国主义一样，日子也越来越不好过。在全世界马克思列宁主义者的不断揭露和斗争下，苏联修正主义集团及其一伙陷于空前的孤立。全世界革命人民日益认识到，要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义，决没有中间道路可走，决不能同苏共领导搞什么“联合行动”。
    今年以来，苏共新领导变本加厉地推行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义，在背叛马克思列宁主义、投降美帝国主义的道路上，比赫鲁晓夫走得更远。他们加紧勾结美帝国主义和各国反动派，拼凑反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的新的神圣同盟。他们适应美国全球战略重点东移的需要，在欧洲同美国达成冻结欧洲现状的默契，使美国从西欧撤出军队，来对付越南人民、印度支那人民和中国人民。在越南问题上，他们千方百计为美国的“和谈”骗局效劳，妄图帮助美国侵略者扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的熊熊烈火。在联合国内外，苏共新领导加紧同美国进行各种出卖各国人民利益的肮脏的政治交易。他们比赫鲁晓夫更加露骨地进行分裂、破坏和颠覆马克思列宁主义兄弟党和各国革命派的罪恶勾当。他们在国内推行资本主义复辟，也更加猖狂。苏共新领导的这些活动更加清楚地暴露了他们是不可救药的叛徒和美帝国主义的头号帮凶。
    苏共新领导在国内外的倒行逆施，完全违背苏联人民和全世界人民的根本利益，遭到了国内外广大革命人民日益强烈的反对。在现代修正主义集团里，也是矛盾重重，苏共新领导的霸主地位越来越削弱，指挥棒越来越不灵了。尽管苏共领导集团竭力支撑门面，也无法掩饰他们在国内外面临的各种尖锐矛盾和严重困难。苏联修正主义领导集团像美帝国主义一样，也是一只十分虚弱的纸老虎。
