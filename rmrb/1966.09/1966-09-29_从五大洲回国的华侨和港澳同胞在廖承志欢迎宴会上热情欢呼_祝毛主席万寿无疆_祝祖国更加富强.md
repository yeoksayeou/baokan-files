Over a thousand overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots who returned from more than 20 countries and regions on five continents to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations gathered tonight with Party and state leaders and responsible persons from various relevant departments. They enthusiastically wished our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao a long life and wished our great motherland to be even more prosperous and strong.

Tonight, Liao Chengzhi, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, hosted a grand welcome banquet for the returning overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots. Party and state leaders Tao Zhu, Chen Yi, Ye Jianying, He Xiangning, and others attended the banquet.

Chen Yi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke at the banquet. He, on behalf of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the State Council, extended the warmest welcome to the returning overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots. He said that the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots love their motherland and have made contributions to the construction of the motherland. They deserve the warmest welcome from the people of the entire country.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao are in excellent health. This is the greatest piece of good news. I want to report this to you first, and it is worth our joint celebration.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that it is under the correct leadership and wise decisions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee that our great motherland has developed, prospered, and grown strong. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, we will definitely defeat American imperialism and make greater contributions to the defense of world peace.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that this year is the first year of our great motherland's implementation of the third five-year plan. Industrial products across the country can overfulfill this year's national plan; agriculture can now be assured of a bumper harvest this year; the level of science and technology is improving rapidly; and national defense power is unprecedentedly strong. He emphasized that if any enemy dares to launch an attack on our great motherland, we will definitely defeat them completely and smash them to pieces.

Vice Premier Chen Yi stressed that since Chairman Mao personally led us in launching the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres across the country have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought with high spirits, smashed the "four olds," established the "four news," and carried out a great revolution. A new situation of unprecedented unity and solidarity has emerged across the country. Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that it can be said with certainty that after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great motherland will be even stronger, and we should feel limitless joy and excitement about this.

Vice Premier Chen Yi finally proposed a toast to the health of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, to the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, to the prosperity and strength of our great motherland, to the great unity of all ethnic groups in the country, and to the great unity of all peoples of the world.

At this moment, the banquet hall resonated with a long, stormy applause.

Liao Chengzhi spoke first at the beginning of the banquet, extending the warmest greetings to all the returning overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots.

At tonight's banquet, Zhao Xiaoshou, who, in Indonesia, insisted on national dignity and fought bravely against the mad anti-China and anti-Chinese forces of the Indonesian rightists, and patriotic overseas Chinese Huang Mude, Chen Qiangsen, Wu Pengde, and others received particularly warm welcomes from everyone.
