We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's sincere expectations. We will definitely adopt the attitude of masters of the country, shoulder the two burdens of the Cultural Revolution and production construction, carry out the revolution, promote production, firmly hold our production posts, seize the opportunity, not miss the agricultural season, grasp each production link, and strive for a bumper agricultural harvest for the whole year.

The "Sixteen Articles" personally drafted and presided over by Chairman Mao, in the fourteenth article "Carry out the revolution, promote production," points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." This is extremely wise and correct. Since our commune started the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants has soared to an unprecedented height, and production has been excellent all along. Early rice has already been harvested, and late rice is growing well.

Especially under the inspiration of the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, we are fighting against the "Four Olds" on the one hand, and on the other hand, we are using the momentum of breaking the "Four Olds" to break through production difficulties. In the face of prolonged drought and worsening drought conditions, we have fully utilized the power of mechanical and electrical irrigation, built dams to block rivers, and diverted water to irrigate fields, using every possible means to ensure a bumper harvest of late rice.

    响应毛主席伟大号召  夺取农业大丰收
    湖南长沙县红旗公社贫协副主任  徐学义
    我们贫下中农一定不辜负毛主席和党中央的殷切期望，一定要用主人翁的态度，挑起文化大革命和生产建设两副担子，抓革命，促生产，坚守生产岗位，不失时机，不误农时，抓好各个生产环节，夺取全年农业大丰收。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条，在第十四条“抓革命，促生产”中指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”这是非常英明、正确的。我们公社自开展学习毛主席著作运动以来，广大贫下中农革命热情空前高涨，生产一直搞得出色。早稻已获得了丰收，晚稻长势很好。
    特别是在红卫兵的革命精神鼓舞下，我们一方面向“四旧”开火，一方面又用破“四旧”的劲头，来破生产上的难关。在久旱不雨、旱情日益严重的情况下，我们充分发挥机电排灌的威力，同时拦河筑坝，引水灌田，想尽一切办法保证晚稻丰收。
