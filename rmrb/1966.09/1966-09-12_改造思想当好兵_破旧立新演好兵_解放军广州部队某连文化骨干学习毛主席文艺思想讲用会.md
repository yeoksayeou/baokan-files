**Transforming Thoughts to Be Good Soldiers, Breaking Old Habits to Perform as Good Soldiers**

**— A Study Session on Chairman Mao’s Thoughts on Literature and Art by Cultural Cadres of a Company in the Guangzhou Military Region**

**Starting with the Soldiers**

Shouldering a rifle, wearing a green uniform,
Blowing, plucking, and singing, the "soldier" is the main theme.
Deputy Political Instructor Luo Zhongqing: This song is a collective creation by our performance group and also a self-portrait of our group. In the past, comrades often said: what we sing, perform, write, and draw are all about soldiers. The audience is soldiers, and the performers are also soldiers. We thought that the issues of direction and stance had been resolved long ago, and there was nothing more to "break." Recently, through repeated study of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other works, through the education of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and through self-examination to identify influences and harms, everyone was shocked. We not only need to break, but we must break immediately. If we don't break, the performance will not be like a soldier. To perform like a soldier and better serve the soldiers, let's discuss our thoughts based on Chairman Mao's instructions.

**Why Did the Tune Go Astray?**

Soldier and Revolutionary Committee Member Fu Qinghuan: I have a good voice and love singing. After joining the army, I became the person in charge of teaching songs in the company. Initially, I felt that during roll calls, drills, and classes, we always sang "I Am a Soldier," which was not "rich and varied." Therefore, I came up with an idea to teach some so-called lyrical songs. Later, the company asked me to teach "Ready to Fight." I thought the melody of this song was too simple, so I added some notes when teaching it. Political Instructor Zhang Zhongming heard it and asked me, "Why do you sing this song out of tune when you can sing complex film songs without any problems?" I said, "Singing it this way makes the emotions richer and not too rigid." The instructor said, "It turns out that your thoughts are out of tune, so you sang the spirit of our revolutionary soldiers out of tune." Later, with the help of Comrade Zhang Zhongming, I understood that "singing a revolutionary song well is like giving a good political lesson." My past "richness" was not the revolutionary fighting spirit of the proletariat but the "corrosive agent" of the bourgeoisie, so I sang out of tune and went to the bourgeois tune. From then on, every time I teach a song, I treat it as giving a new weapon to my comrades, so I no longer sing out of tune.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make one's works welcome by the masses, one must change one's thoughts and emotions and undergo a transformation. Without this change and transformation, nothing can be done well, everything will be out of place." Chairman Mao's words are the absolute truth. I deeply feel that only by thoroughly eliminating bourgeois thoughts and emotions from my mind can I sing songs full of proletarian fighting spirit.

**What Kind of Strings to Set?**

New Soldier and Performance Group Member Liu Xirong: In the past, when I was studying at home, I had a special love for instruments like the erhu and sanxian. I thought that expressing emotions with instruments and communicating with strings was the most poetic. So every time I played the erhu or sanxian, I always liked to set the strings low, playing "Rain on Banana Leaves" and "Zhao Jun Leaves the Palace," thinking it was "pleasing to the ear" and "melodious." However, after joining the army, I found that I was always playing "Ready to Fight" and other tunes, which I found dry and bland. Therefore, besides accompanying, I would always play and appreciate tunes like "Rain on Banana Leaves" during leisure time or evening gatherings. Many comrades asked, "Liu, what are you playing? It's so low and soft, how can we hear any fighting spirit?" I didn't say anything, but I was not convinced in my heart.

After studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" again, I realized. I understood that liking certain tunes and not liking others is not just a matter of personal interest but also a matter of what kind of thoughts one has and what kind of strings and tunes one should set. The reason I easily set the strings low and soft was that I appreciated not the "gunpowder smell" that revolutionary soldiers commonly love but the pastime of bourgeois intellectuals. The result of this appreciation would inevitably allow the decaying bourgeois thoughts to creep into our minds through the erhu and sanxian, corrupt our souls, and weaken our fighting spirit.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To make literature and art become a good part of the revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy." We revolutionary soldiers must set the strings high, play out revolutionary enthusiasm, perform the majestic spirit of the proletariat, and the forward-marching heroism, turning magnificent revolutionary songs into the power to fight the enemy! To do this, we must eliminate the influence of old bourgeois culture and truly establish a proletarian worldview. Otherwise, even if we can play a thousand revolutionary tunes, we cannot express the feelings of a revolutionary soldier!

**Why Don’t the Paintings of Soldiers Look Like Soldiers?**

Wall Newspaper Committee Member Zhou Mianmou: As soon as I enlisted, I became the wall newspaper committee member. Initially, I wanted to contribute my "two brushes" to the company, drawing very enthusiastically, drawing a lot of flowers and grass. But after everyone saw it, they shook their heads. Later, I thought, since everyone doesn't like flowers and grass, let's draw soldiers. But after drawing the soldiers, everyone said, "Zhou has some skill, but he drew a heroic revolutionary soldier like a young woman."

Later, with the help of the political instructor, I studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" repeatedly with questions in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Before educating the workers, peasants, and soldiers, there is first the task of learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Chairman Mao's words hit the mark. Yes, to draw soldiers like soldiers, one must first learn from the soldiers and have the same thoughts and emotions as the soldiers. From then on, I drew and transformed my thoughts, trying to express the heroic feelings of revolutionary soldiers reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, being in the company, and having a global vision. Many comrades praised, "Zhou, now you draw soldiers like soldiers."

From "drawing soldiers not like soldiers" to "like soldiers," I deeply feel that only by having the thoughts of a revolutionary soldier can I draw the heroic image of a revolutionary soldier. Otherwise, even if I can draw the appearance of a soldier, I can never draw the radiant thoughts of a revolutionary soldier!

**A Title Reflects Old and New**

Wall Newspaper Committee Member Zeng Guanqing: Your singing and playing can be influenced by old culture, and so can our writing and publishing wall newspapers.

When I first enlisted two years ago, I went with the old soldier Chen Zhencheng to engage in sideline production. We worked and talked heart to heart, and he helped me a lot, even initiating a "Red Pair" plan with me. In the evening, I wrote an article about his help, titled "Talking About 'Friendship' on the Labor Field." But later, I thought the title was too bland, with no metaphor, and couldn't attract attention. After repeated consideration, I changed the title to "Talking About 'Love' on the Labor Field," thinking this title was fresh and would definitely attract people. However, as soon as the blackboard newspaper was hung up, Second Platoon Leader Li Jia'an pointed out to me: Revolutionary soldiers cannot compare class friendship and fighting comradeship to "love." Many comrades also commented: "This is not the language of soldiers."

Why did I change a clear and understandable title to something inappropriate? It was because of the influence of bourgeois writers. In the past, I read some messy miscellaneous articles, thinking these articles' titles were "fresh and interesting" and "thought-provoking," so I imitated them. I never expected that one imitation would let a bourgeois "black worm" crawl into my brain, messing up my thoughts. Through comrades' criticisms, I revisited Chairman Mao's teachings about "our literature and art are for the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers," and received great education and enlightenment. From then on, I always followed Chairman Mao's instructions, always learning from the soldiers, making my feelings quickly align with the soldiers' feelings. This year, when implementing the spirit of the military political work conference, according to the party branch's decision, we opened a "Soldiers' Comments" column on the blackboard newspaper, using the common language of soldiers from the title to the content, such as "Grasping Living Thoughts Cannot Rest," "When I Ruined the Dishes," etc., all of which were deeply welcomed by the entire company's officers and soldiers.

**Performing Soldiers and Being Soldiers**

Performance Group Member Li Xuewen: After joining the company's performance group, I participated several times in performances about Zhang Zhongming, a model soldier who served for ten years and was a five-good soldier in the military region. Every performance, I sang the lyrics with full enthusiasm, arranged the program, and learned the actions, determined to present Zhang Zhongming's noble thoughts and virtues. But after each performance, I always heard some comrades say, "Your performance is like acting, not like Zhang Zhongming." Why did I put in so much effort but perform poorly? Chairman Mao said: "Since the object of literary and artistic work is the workers, peasants, and soldiers and their cadres, there arises the question of understanding and familiarizing oneself with them." Chairman Mao's teachings made me understand that although I performed Zhang Zhongming's deeds, I did not understand Zhang Zhongming's thoughts and had not made his thoughts my own. Therefore, it's no wonder that the performance only seemed like "acting," not like the real thing. From then on, I took Zhang Zhongming as an example to transform my thoughts. As my thoughts gradually aligned with Zhang Zhongming's, the performance also became more like the real thing.

Eliminating the influence of old culture is not just the job of professional troupes; in company cultural activities, the influence of old culture also exists. To perform a soldier well, one must first be a good soldier, learn to be a soldier, and become a true soldier. Without the thoughts, emotions, and virtues of the performer, even if the lyrics are good, the tune is new, and the performance skills are high, it is impossible to express the image and thoughts of a soldier.

**The Key is to Be a Good Ordinary Soldier**

Deputy Political Instructor Luo Zhongqing: Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the revolutionary general front." Our company's cultural work is a powerful assistant of the party branch, a necessary and important front to ensure the implementation of the five principles of emphasizing politics, and an indispensable battlefield to guide soldiers to accelerate the realization of ideological revolutionization. However, from everyone's speeches, it can be seen that this front of our company is not very effective, and this battlefield is not solid enough.

As the saying goes, "What bird builds what nest, what feelings sing what songs." We shoulder a rifle, wear a green uniform, blow, pluck, and sing, all about soldiers, but why don't we look like soldiers? Because our minds still lack the feelings of soldiers. Just as comrades said, it's not that the strings on the erhu are not set correctly, but the "strings" in our thoughts are not set correctly, so good songs are sung wrong, and high-spirited tunes are played softly. This shows that the influence of the bourgeois literary and artistic black line is not only outside the military but also inside the military, not only in professional troupes above but also in our company's amateur cultural activities. Therefore, to insist on the political first standard of literature and art, we must first hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds and firmly guard the proletarian ideological front. Only when the thoughts of our cultural cadres are truly revolutionized can we resist the influence of the bourgeois literary and artistic black line, set the tune correctly, correct the score, and truly serve proletarian politics. This requires us to take Chairman Mao's books as the highest directive in the future, continuously strengthen self-transformation. Only when our thoughts are revolutionized can we firmly implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, serving to eliminate the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat, consolidate and enhance combat effectiveness.

    改造思想当好兵　破旧立新演好兵
    ——解放军广州部队某连文化骨干学习毛主席文艺思想讲用会
    从“兵”谈起
    肩扛一支枪，身穿绿军装，
    吹拉和弹唱，“兵”字放头桩。
    副指导员罗仲卿：这首歌是咱们演唱组的集体创作，也是咱们演唱组的自我写照。过去同志们常说：我们唱的、演的、写的、画的都是兵，台下是兵，台上还是兵，认为方向和立场问题早就解决了，没有什么好“破”的了。最近，通过反复学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等著作，通过无产阶级文化大革命的教育，通过查影响，找危害，大家都大吃一惊。我们不仅需要破，而且要立即破。不破，演兵就不像兵。为了演兵像兵，更好地为兵服务，现在就请大家以毛主席的教导为最高指示，谈谈自己的体会。
      为什么会“跑调”？
    战士、革委会委员傅清焕：我有一副好嗓子，特别喜爱唱歌。到部队后，我当上了连队革委会委员，同志们便叫我负责教歌。开始，我感到大家出操上课，集合点名，唱的老是《我是一个兵》，不够“丰富多采”，因此我出了个点子，教大家唱些所谓抒情歌曲。后来，连里叫我教唱《说打就打》，我觉得这首歌的曲调太简单，教唱时就加了些音符。指导员张仲明同志听到后，就问我：“那么复杂的电影歌曲，你都唱不跑调，怎么这个歌子却唱跑了调？”我说：“这样唱感情才丰富些，不会太硬。”指导员说：“原来是你的思想里跑了调，所以才把咱们革命战士的硬骨头精神唱跑了。”后来，在张指导员的帮助下，我明白了“唱好一首革命歌子，就等于上好一堂政治课”的道理。自己过去“丰富”的不是无产阶级革命战士的战斗激情，而是资产阶级的“腐蚀剂”，所以才唱跑了调，跑到资产阶级的调上去了。从此以后，我每教一首歌，都当成是交给战友们一个新的杀敌武器来对待，因此再也不跑调了。
    毛主席教导我们：“要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”毛主席的话是千真万确的真理。我深深地体会到，只有彻底破除头脑里的资产阶级思想感情，才能唱出满怀无产阶级战斗激情的歌。
      定什么样的“弦”？
    新战士、演唱组组员刘锡荣：过去在家读书时，我对二胡、三弦等乐器有特殊的爱好，觉得以琴抒情，用弦谈心，这是最富有诗意的。所以每当我拉起二胡，弹起三弦的时候，总爱把弦定得低低的，拉的是《雨打芭蕉》，弹的是《昭君出塞》，认为“悦耳动听”，“婉转优美”。可是，来到部队后，成天拉的弹的都是《说打就打》等曲子，觉得干燥无味。因此，平时除了伴奏之外，每当课余或开晚会时，我总要把那“优美动听”的《雨打芭蕉》之类的曲子拿来弹奏欣赏一番。很多同志们听了后，问：“小刘！你弹的啥家伙？低沉沉的，软绵绵的，怎么一点战斗的味也听不出来。”听到这种提问，我嘴上不说，心里却不服气。
    重新学习了毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，我明白过来了。我懂得了喜欢什么曲调，不喜欢什么曲调，不只是个人的兴趣爱好问题，而是有什么样的思想，也就一定要定什么弦、弹什么调。自己之所以容易把调子定得低沉沉的，软绵绵的，就是因为自己欣赏的不是革命战士所共同喜爱的“火药气味”，而是资产阶级知识分子所喜爱的消遣品。这种喜爱的结果，必然会让没落的资产阶级思想从二胡、三弦上钻到我们的脑子里来，腐蚀我们的灵魂，削弱我们的斗志。
    毛主席教导过我们：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器。”我们革命战士就是要把弦定得高高的，弹出革命的豪迈激情，奏出无产阶级的雄伟气魄和勇往直前的英雄气概，把雄壮的革命歌曲变成杀敌的力量！为此，就必须破除资产阶级旧文化的影响，真正树立起无产阶级世界观，否则，即使能弹出一千个革命的曲调，也表达不出一个革命战士的感情来！
      画兵为啥不像兵？
    墙报委员周绵谋：我一入伍，就担任了墙报委员。开始，我一心想把自己的“两把刷子”贡献给连队，画得非常热心，什么花呀，草呀，画了一大堆。可是大伙看后，一个劲地摇头。以后我又想，既然大伙都不喜欢花草，就来个兵画兵吧！但兵画出来后，大伙又说：“小周倒有‘两下子’，把威武的革命战士画成个大姑娘了。”
    后来，在指导员的帮助下，我带着问题反复学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席说：“在教育工农兵的任务之前，就先有一个学习工农兵的任务。”毛主席的话说到了我的心坎里。是呀，要画兵像兵，首先必须向战士学习，具备和战士同样的思想感情。打那时候起，我边画画边改造思想，每插一幅画，都努力去抒发革命战士读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，身在连队，胸怀世界的豪迈感情了。不少同志夸奖说：“小周，现在画兵像兵了。”
    从“画兵不像兵”到“像兵”，我深深体会到，只有自己具备了革命战士的思想，才能画出革命战士的英姿。否则，即使能画出战士的模样，也永远画不出革命战士的思想光辉！
        一个标题见新旧
    墙报委员曾观庆：你们拉拉唱唱的会受到旧文化的影响，我们写稿、出墙报的也不例外。
    前年刚入伍时，我和老战士陈镇城一起去搞副业生产。我们边劳动边谈心，他对我帮助很大，并主动和我订了“一对红”计划。晚上，我就把他帮助我的经过写成稿子，题目定为《劳动场上话“友情”》。但后来一考虑，觉得题目很呆板，没有一点比喻手法，不能引人注目。经过反复推敲以后，我把题目改为《劳动场上谈“爱情”》，觉得这个题目挺新鲜，一定能吸引人。那知黑板报刚一挂出，二班长李家安就给我指出：革命战士不能把阶级友爱、战斗友情比喻成“爱情”。很多同志也议论说：“这不是咱当兵的语言。”
    为什么会把一个非常明白易懂的标题，改为一个不伦不类的东西呢？就是因为受了资产阶级文人的影响。过去我看过一些乌七八糟的杂文，觉得这些文章的标题“新鲜别致”、“令人回味”，所以我也就模仿起来。万万没想到这一模仿，一条资产阶级的“黑虫”就爬进了自己的脑袋，搅乱了自己的思想。经过同志们的批评，我带着问题重温了毛主席关于“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的”等教导，受到了很大的教育和启发。打那以后，我时时按照毛主席的指示去做，时时注意向战士学习，使自己的感情尽快地和战士的感情合到一块去。今年在贯彻全军政工会议精神时，根据党支部的决定，我们在黑板报上开辟了《战士评论》专栏，从题到文都注意运用了战士的共同语言，如《抓活思想不能休息》、《当我把菜做坏了的时候》等文章，都深受全连干部战士的欢迎。
          演兵和当兵
    演唱组组员李学文：我参加了连里演唱组后，曾几次参加过歌唱服役十年十年红的军区五好战士标兵张仲明同志的演出。每次演出，我都满腔热情地背唱词，排节目，学动作，决心把张仲明同志崇高的思想品德表现出来。但每次演出后，总是听到一些同志说：“你演的像做戏，不像张仲明。”为什么费力不少，演的不好呢？毛主席说：“既然文艺工作的对象是工农兵及其干部，就发生一个了解他们熟悉他们的问题。”毛主席的教导使我懂得了，我演的虽然是张仲明的事，但并不熟悉张仲明的思想，更没有把他的思想变成自己的思想。因此，演起来也就难怪只像“做戏”，不像真事了。从此以后，我处处以张仲明为榜样，来改造自己的思想。随着自己的思想不断与张仲明同志思想的接近，再演起来也就比以前像得多了。
    破除旧文化的影响，不仅是专业剧团的事，在连队文化活动中，同样也存在着旧文化的影响。要演好一个兵，自己必须先当好兵，学好兵，成为一个真正的兵。没有被演者的思想感情和品德，唱词再好，调子再新，表演技巧再高，也无法表达出兵的形象，兵的思想。
  关键在于当好普通一兵
    副指导员罗仲卿：毛主席说：“革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”我们连队文化工作是党支部的有力助手，是保证突出政治五项原则落实的一条必要和重要的战线，是指引战士加速实现思想革命化的必不可少的阵地。可是，从大家的发言中，可以看出，我们连队的这个战线还不太得力，这个阵地还不够牢固。
    俗话说“什么鸟筑什么窝，什么感情唱什么歌。”我们肩扛一支枪，身穿绿军装，吹拉弹唱都是兵，可为什么不像兵呢？因为我们脑子里还缺少兵的感情。正像同志们所说的，不是二胡上的弦没有定准，而是思想上的“弦”没有定准，所以好歌唱歪了，高昂的曲调拉软了。这就说明资产阶级文艺黑线的影响，不仅军外有，军内也有，上面的专业剧团有，我们连队的业余文化活动中也有。因此，要坚持政治第一的文艺标准，首先就要在自己的思想上把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高高的，把无产阶级的思想阵地守得牢牢的。只有我们文化骨干的思想真正革命化了，才能抵制住资产阶级文艺黑线的影响，才能把调定准，把曲谱正，才能真正为无产阶级政治服务。这就要求我们，今后要把毛主席的书当作最高指示，不断加强自我改造。只有思想革命化了，才能坚定不移地贯彻毛主席的文艺方针，为灭资兴无、巩固和提高战斗力服务。
