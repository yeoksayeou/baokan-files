Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, during this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the young Red Guards have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. With a force as mighty as a landslide and as powerful as thunder, they have struck down all the monsters and demons, leaving them scattered and defeated. Your actions have made the revolutionary people stand tall and proud!

You are truly the young generation nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, full of vigor and high in spirit. Your daring to think, to speak, to act, and to revolutionize has greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit of the people across the nation. Your revolutionary spirit has shaken the world, especially striking fear into the hearts of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries. Your revolutionary actions have uprooted the old roots of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, ensuring that their plots to restore these systems in China will never succeed.

This is a great revolution that touches the souls of people. All the monsters and demons are most afraid of the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. With the mighty magic mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, all these monsters and demons will be exposed in broad daylight, with nowhere to hide. In this great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, keep our eyes sharp, and distinguish who our enemies are and who our friends are. This is the primary question of the revolution. Therefore, we must seriously study, become familiar with, and master the "Sixteen Points," using them as our weapon to firmly grasp the correct direction of the struggle. We will fight down, fight over, and fight to disgrace all the monsters and demons, ensuring they never rise again.

We oil workers, like you, listen to Chairman Mao the most, love Chairman Mao the most, believe in Chairman Mao the most, and admire Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our lives. In the midst of a raging inferno, all our comrades have fought bravely, fearing neither death nor hardship, displaying unyielding courage and daring to face any danger. We extinguished a massive fire in just thirty minutes, protecting the gas field, all because Mao Zedong Thought was guiding our battle. Whenever we think of Chairman Mao, we are filled with boundless strength. We deeply understand that a knife needs sharpening to be effective, water needs boiling to be useful, and people need to study Chairman Mao's works to become revolutionaries. Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought must never be abandoned for a moment. We must keep Chairman Mao's instructions forever in our minds, in our blood, and put them into action.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we stand firmly with you, fighting side by side. With one hand, we wield the pen to criticize the old world and sweep away all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits. With the other hand, we hold the drill bit, turning the drilling site into a battlefield against imperialism and revisionism. We will drill more wells, drill them faster, and drill them well, producing more oil and gas. We resolutely respond to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." We will take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as our guideline and the "Sixteen Points" as our weapon, ensuring victory in both revolution and production.

    致革命的小闯将——红卫兵
    三二一一一钻井队全体革命职工
    在伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵小将们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，把一切牛鬼蛇神打得落花流水。你们的行动使革命人民扬眉吐气！
    你们不愧是毛泽东思想哺育下的年青一代，朝气蓬勃，斗志高昂。你们敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢干、敢于革命的精神，大大鼓舞了全国人民的革命志气。你们的革命精神震撼了全世界，特别是吓得帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派胆战心惊，害怕得要命。你们的革命行动，铲掉了封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的老根，使它们在中国复辟的阴谋永远不能得逞。
    这是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。所有的牛鬼蛇神，都是最害怕毛泽东思想的阳光，用毛泽东思想这个威力无穷的照妖镜一照，就会使那些牛鬼蛇神暴露在光天化日之下，无处藏身。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，擦亮眼睛，分清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。这是革命的首要问题。因此，我们一定要认真地学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，以十六条为武器，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把一切牛鬼蛇神斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，斗得它们永世不得翻身。
    我们石油工人和你们一样，最听毛主席的话，最热爱毛主席，最信仰毛主席，最崇拜毛主席。毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们生命的灵魂。我们在血战火海的战斗中，全队同志前赴后继，视死如归，英勇顽强，赴汤蹈火，以三十分钟扑灭了一场冲天的大火，保卫了大气田，就因为是毛泽东思想在指挥我们战斗。一想起毛主席，我们就有了无穷无尽的力量。我们深深体会到：刀不磨不快，水不烧不开，人不学毛主席著作就不能当革命派。头可断，血可流，毛主席思想一时一刻不能丢。我们要把毛主席的指示，永远印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。
    在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们坚决和你们站在一起，并肩战斗，一手拿笔杆，批判旧世界，荡涤一切旧思想，旧文化，旧风俗，旧习惯；一手扶刹把，把井场当作反帝反修的战场，多打井，快打井，打好井，拿出更多的油和气。我们坚决响应党中央和毛主席发出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，以十六条为武器，保证革命和生产双胜利。
