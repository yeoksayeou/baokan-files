The "Sixteen Points" formulated under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong correctly points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of the productive forces in our country."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is powerfully promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, further liberating the productive forces of society, and further unleashing the greater enthusiasm and creativity of the working class and the members of rural people's communes, creating new favorable conditions for the great development of industry and agriculture.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out at the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan: "The rectification movement and the production movement, which began in 1942 and 1943 respectively, have played and are playing a decisive role in the spiritual and material life of the people. If we do not grasp these two links at the appropriate time, we will not be able to grasp the entire revolutionary chain, and our struggle will not be able to continue to advance."

The rectification movement Comrade Mao Zedong proposed at that time is the ideological revolution movement. The role of the rectification movement and the production movement he explained is that we must grasp these two links in a timely manner to ensure that our struggle continues to advance. These are completely applicable to us now.

The proletarian cultural revolution and the socialist production movement are interrelated. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is aimed at revolutionizing people's thinking, thereby making all work done better, faster, more, and more economically. We must take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, grasp both revolution and production, and ensure that neither the cultural revolution nor production is neglected.

In building socialism, we have both the ideological front and the material front. The ideological front is to transform old ideas and raise socialist revolutionary consciousness. The material front is to transform nature and develop the socialist national economy. Advanced thought leads the way. Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive driving us forward on both fronts. By using Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's souls and promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, we can win on the ideological front, thereby arousing people's conscious initiative and ensuring that we can win even greater victories on the material front.

This year is the first year of implementing China's third five-year plan. Our broad masses of workers, commune members, scientific and technological personnel, and other laborers should all apply the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm aroused in the cultural revolution to the struggle in industrial and agricultural production and scientific experiments. We should take the attitude of masters, firmly guard our production posts, seize the production links at the right time, and bring about a new look and new prosperity in industrial and agricultural production.

All leaders of industrial and mining enterprises, people's communes, basic construction units, and scientific research units must firmly grasp the two links of cultural revolution and production development, and arrange their work well. They should appropriately divide the work and form two appropriate teams. One team mainly focuses on the cultural revolution, and the other team mainly focuses on production, including production quantity, variety, and quality, especially quality. The team focusing on production should also participate in the cultural revolution, but should mainly concentrate on leading production. The two teams should have unified leadership and should not act independently. As long as the masses are fully mobilized and proper arrangements are made, it is possible to achieve victory in both the cultural revolution and production.

The cultural revolution in industrial and mining enterprises, basic construction units, scientific research units, and service industries, and the socialist education movement in rural areas, i.e., the "Four Clean-ups" movement, should be carried out by the revolutionary masses in those places. If the original arrangements for the "Four Clean-ups" movement in cities and countryside are deemed appropriate by the masses and are proceeding well, they should not be changed. Red Guards and revolutionary students in schools should not interfere with those arrangements or participate in their debates. Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force of the revolution, and they can certainly carry out their own revolutionary movements well. Moreover, the situation in those places is different, and the production tasks are heavy. Outsiders who are not familiar with the situation may interfere and easily affect the normal progress of production.

Now, the autumn harvest is approaching, and it seems to be a good year. All levels of leadership, especially county and rural people's commune leaders, must not miss the agricultural season and concentrate all efforts on the autumn harvest this year. During the busy agricultural season, the "Four Clean-ups" movement can be temporarily suspended. Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students in schools should be organized to go to the countryside to participate in labor and help with the autumn harvest, learning the diligence, revolutionary spirit, and excellent work ethic of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using the "Sixteen Points" as a spiritual weapon, grasping the revolution and promoting production is a major task facing the entire Party and the people of the whole country. We are firmly convinced that with the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new high tide of socialist production and construction will definitely emerge.

Comrade Mao Zedong said at the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan: "The historical importance of the two great movements of rectification and production is undoubtedly clear."

He also said: "Let us further and universally promote these two great movements as the foundation for other combat tasks. If we can do so, then the thorough liberation of the Chinese people will be assured."

The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution fully prove the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's wise judgment.

At present, if we firmly and unswervingly follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, further and universally promote the two great movements of cultural revolution and production development, then in the great cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, we will achieve even greater victories. Is there any doubt about this? We believe this is undoubtedly clear.

### 抓革命，促生产

    抓革命，促生产
    毛泽东同志主持制定的十六条正确地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，正在有力地促进人的思想革命化，进一步解放社会生产力，进一步发挥工人群众、农村人民公社社员的更大的生产积极性和创造性，为工业农业的大发展创造新的有利条件。
    毛泽东同志在抗日战争末期指出：“一九四二和一九四三两年先后开始的带普遍性的整风运动和生产运动，曾经分别地在精神生活方面和物质生活方面起了和正在起着决定性的作用。这两个环子，如果不在适当的时机抓住它们，我们就无法抓住整个的革命链条，而我们的斗争也就不能继续前进。”
    毛泽东同志当时提出的整风运动，也就是思想革命运动。他所说明的整风运动和生产运动的作用，认为必须及时抓住这两个环子，使我们的斗争继续前进。这些，对我们现在，是完全适用的。
    无产阶级文化革命运动和社会主义生产运动，是相互联系的。无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。我们一定要以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，保证文化革命和生产两不误。
    我们搞社会主义，有精神战线和物质战线。精神战线是改造旧思想，提高社会主义的革命觉悟。物质战线是改造自然，发展社会主义国民经济。先进的思想领先。毛泽东思想就是我们在这两条战线上前进的火车头。用毛泽东思想去改造人的灵魂，促进人的思想革命化，而在精神战线上打了胜仗，从而激发人的自觉能动性，也就保证物质战线上能够打更大的胜仗。
    今年，是执行我国第三个五年计划的第一年。我们的广大工人、公社社员、科学技术人员和其他劳动者，都应当把在文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天的革命干劲，用到工农业生产和科学实验的斗争中去。我们应当以主人翁的姿态，坚守生产岗位，不失时机地掌握生产环节，使工农业生产出现更新的面貌，更新的繁荣。
    所有工矿企业、人民公社、基本建设单位和科学研究单位的领导人员，都要紧紧抓住文化革命和发展生产这两个环子，很好地安排自己的工作。要适当地分工，搞两个适当的班子。一个班子主要抓文化革命，一个班子主要抓生产，抓生产的产量、品种和质量，特别是要狠抓质量。抓生产的班子，也要参加文化革命，但是，应当以主要精力领导生产。两个班子要有统一的领导，不可各自为政。只要充分发动群众，进行妥善安排，就能够保证文化革命和生产双胜利。
    工矿企业、基本建设单位、科学研究单位以及服务行业的文化革命运动，农村的社会主义教育运动即“四清”运动，都应当由那里的革命群众来进行。城乡“四清”运动的原来部署，如果群众认为适当，又进行得很好，就可以不变动。学校的红卫兵和革命学生，不要到那些地方去干预他们那些部署，也不必去参加那里的辩论。工人、贫下中农是革命的主力军，他们完全能够把本身的革命运动搞好。而且那里的情况不同，生产任务很重，外边的人不明了情况，去干预，容易影响生产的正常进行。
    现在，秋收快到了，看来是一个好年成。各级领导，特别是县和农村人民公社的领导，一定要不误农时，集中全力抓好今年的秋收。农忙的时候，“四清”运动可以暂时停下来。学校的红卫兵和革命师生，应当有组织地到农村去参加劳动，帮助秋收，学习贫下中农的勤劳、革命干劲和优良的劳动品质。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以十六条为精神武器，抓革命，促生产，这是摆在我们全党和全国人民面前的重大任务。我们坚信，随着无产阶级文化大革命的高潮，必将出现一个社会主义生产建设的新高潮。
    毛泽东同志在抗日战争末期说过：“……整风和生产两大运动，具有何种历史重要性，是明白无疑的了。”
    他又说：“让我们进一步地、普遍地去推广这两大运动，以为其他各项战斗任务的基础。果能如此，那末，中国人民的彻底解放，就有把握了。”
    中国人民解放战争的胜利，中国人民大革命的胜利，完全证实了毛泽东同志这个英明的论断。
    当前，如果我们坚定不移地按照毛泽东同志的指示，进一步地、普遍地去推广文化革命和发展生产这两大运动，那末，我们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大事业中，将取得更加伟大的胜利，难道还有疑问吗？我们认为，这是明白无疑的了。
