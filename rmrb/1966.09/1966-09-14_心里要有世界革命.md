I am a daughter of a poor peasant. I am eighteen years old this year. After reading Chairman Mao's books, my class consciousness has been raised, and I have made up my mind to dedicate my life to the revolution.

To dedicate one's life to the revolution, one must not only care about the revolutionary cause at home but also keep the world revolution in mind.

Since I was young, my grandmother told me about the hardships my family endured in the old society. Of course, those are things of the past. However, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Neither the Chinese reactionaries nor the U.S. imperialists' aggressive forces in China will withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord." Isn't that the case? U.S. imperialism not only continues to let the " Chiang diehard" in Taiwan cause trouble for the Chinese people but also directs its aggression towards China. If the enemy sharpens their knives, we must sharpen ours too. We cannot just hold our hoes and focus on production all day. We must also think about world affairs and be ready to take up arms to defend against the U.S. imperialists' attacks. Thinking of these things, I took on the responsibility of organizing the militia. Our women militia in Xizhou formed the "Liu Huilan Militia Squad" and continuously study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We not only completed the tasks assigned by our superiors but also care about world revolutionary affairs.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have won revolutionary victories should help the people who are still struggling for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Norman Bethune was a Canadian who came to China to help with the revolution. This internationalist spirit is worth learning from. Now, our country is a socialist nation with seven hundred million people, and we have the responsibility to contribute to the world revolution. Currently, in the "world's countryside"—Asia, Africa, and Latin America—the flames of revolution are burning brighter, forming a favorable situation of encircling the "world's city." We in the Taihang Mountains are in an old revolutionary base. In the past, we relied on Chairman Mao's theory of people's war and the theory of surrounding the cities from the countryside to defeat the enemy. Today, the peasants of Taihang Mountains must continue the revolutionary tradition, carry forward the internationalist spirit, and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of our "peasant" brothers in the "world's countryside."

Not long ago, our commune held a meeting to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Our "Liu Huilan Militia Squad" wrote a pledge on the spot: As long as the Vietnamese people need us, and the motherland gives the order, we will immediately take up arms and rush to the front line to fight a big battle with the American devils.

We are Chinese peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We are determined to dedicate our lives to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. We are in the Taihang Mountains, but we have our eyes on the whole world. We not only want to carry out the socialist revolution to the end in our country and do a good job in socialist construction but also firmly support the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and all the peoples of the world to carry the world revolution to the end!

    心里要有世界革命
    我是一个贫农的女儿，今年十八岁。读了毛主席的书，我的阶级觉悟提高了，下定决心要干一辈子革命。
    干一辈子革命，不光要关心国内的革命事业，心里还要想着世界革命。
    我从小就听我奶奶讲我家在旧社会的苦难家史。当然，这些都是过去的事儿了。但是，毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”事情不是这样的吗？美帝国主义不光一直让台湾的“蒋该死”同中国人民捣乱，而且自己也加紧把侵略矛头对准中国。敌人磨刀，我们也要磨刀。我们决不能光是拿着锄头，整天埋头搞生产，还应当想着世界大事，扛起枪准备对付美帝国主义的进攻。想到这些，我就认真地挑起组织民兵的担子。我们西周的女民兵成立了“刘胡兰民兵排”，不断活学活用毛主席著作。我们不光很好地完成了上级交给的任务，而且大家都关心着世界革命的大事。
    毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”白求恩是加拿大人，他到中国来帮助闹革命，这种国际主义精神是值得我们学习的。现在，我国是一个七亿人民的社会主义国家，有责任为世界革命作出自己的贡献。眼下，在“世界的农村”——亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，革命烈火越烧越旺，形成了包围“世界城市”的大好形势。我们所在的太行山是老革命根据地。过去我们是靠毛主席的人民战争的理论、农村包围城市的理论战胜敌人的。今天，我们太行山的农民仍然要继承革命的传统，发扬国际主义的精神，坚决支持“世界农村”的“农民”兄弟的革命斗争。
    不久以前，我们社里召开了一次支援越南人民抗美救国大会，我们“刘胡兰民兵排”当场写下了决心书：只要越南人民需要我们，祖国一声令下，我们就马上拿起武器奔赴前线，同美国佬大干一场。
    我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国农民。我们决心为中国革命、为世界革命干一辈子。我们身在太行山，眼看全世界，不但要把我国的社会主义革命进行到底，把我国的社会主义建设搞好，而且坚决支援亚非拉人民和全世界人民，把世界革命进行到底！
