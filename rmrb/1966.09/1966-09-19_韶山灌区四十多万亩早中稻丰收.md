The Shaoshan irrigation district in Hunan Province has achieved a bumper harvest this year for its 420,000 mu of early and mid-season rice, with yields increasing by 30% compared to last year. Currently, the district's residents are actively engaged in constructing a comprehensive canal system to expand the irrigated area, determined to achieve another bumper harvest for the late-season rice.

The main canal and the North Canal of the Shaoshan irrigation district were completed and watered in June this year. During this period, the district's party committees at all levels held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, promoted revolution, and boosted production. They mobilized the masses to build over 200 kilometers of branch canals and installed 3,900 kilowatts of electric pumping facilities, ensuring that the water facilities for the 50 communes that benefited the earliest were fully integrated. With water secured, the double-cropping rice area in the district expanded by 47% compared to last year. Both the early and mid-season rice achieved unprecedented bumper harvests.
