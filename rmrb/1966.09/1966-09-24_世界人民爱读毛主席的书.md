Chairman Mao's books are the highest level of contemporary Marxist-Leninist classics, and are the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapons for oppressed peoples to rebel and seek liberation. Revolutionary people all over the world love to read Chairman Mao's books. Those who have not obtained these treasures try every means to seek them; those who have obtained them read them voraciously. In this tide of tens of millions of people reading Chairman Mao's works, touching stories emerge every day. Here are a few we recently heard and saw in Africa:

At the Airport

A African traveler, while changing flights at a certain international airport, used his waiting time in the airport hotel to read the _Selected Works of Mao Zedong_ he carried with him. He was noticed by an airport worker. This worker did not leave his side afterwards, obviously having something on his mind but not daring to speak. When it was time to board the plane, the traveler carefully packed his book and prepared to leave. Unexpectedly, the airport worker eagerly helped him with his things and saw him onto the plane. This unusual enthusiasm puzzled him. Just as he was wondering what would happen, the eager airport worker finally mustered the courage to sincerely say, "Friend, can you give me your _Selected Works of Mao Zedong_?" Seeing the traveler's hesitation, he explained that he had made many efforts in his locality but had always been unable to obtain the _Selected Works of Mao Zedong_. He went on, "But you, you can still get another copy somewhere else, right?"

The traveler, though reluctant to part with his beloved treasure, was moved by the stranger's ardent desire to study Mao Zedong's works. So, he took out a copy of Volume 3 of the _Selected Works of Mao Zedong_ and gave it to the airport worker. The latter was overjoyed and thanked him repeatedly.

The plane took off. The traveler in the sky and the worker on the ground had different nationalities and did not even know each other's names, but the great Mao Zedong Thought they both deeply respected and the _Selected Works of Mao Zedong_ they both loved had connected them.

Excellent!

"Excellent!" This was the first reaction of African freedom fighters to the Mao Zedong quotations printed on the cover of Xinhua News Agency news releases. They said that the first thing they did every day when they went to the office was to take the Xinhua News Agency news releases and read the Mao Zedong quotations.

Some people said that these quotations are directly related to the issues in the current struggle against imperialism led by the United States, and therefore these quotations are welcomed by the people.

Some people can already recite Mao Zedong's quotations. One day, two Africans were talking. One was reciting, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. From a long-term point of view, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." When he paused to catch his breath, his colleague immediately continued reciting, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. From a long-term point of view, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

Another African freedom fighter, since the Xinhua News Agency news releases printed Mao Zedong's quotations, began a new and meaningful task: every day he carefully cut out Mao Zedong's quotations and collected them together. He decided to collect all the published Mao Zedong quotations and continue this work.

It Cannot Be Prohibited

Recently, we met an African student who was unreasonably expelled by a revisionist leadership clique in a certain Eastern European country. The reason for his expulsion and the "crime" he was charged with was simply that he loved reading Chairman Mao's books.

Of course, he was not the only victim.

He said that in his still-unliberated homeland, Mao Zedong's works were listed as banned books by the colonial authorities, and reading Mao Zedong's works was illegal. But he never expected that in a country that claims to be "socialist," reading Mao Zedong's works would also be illegal.

However, expulsion or any "crime" cannot stop revolutionary people from loving Mao Zedong's works. This African student said, "If you are a revolutionary, you must read Mao Zedong's works; if you are not a revolutionary, you should not read them. To avoid the failure of our struggle, we must seriously study Mao Zedong's works."

### 世界人民爱读毛主席的书

    世界人民爱读毛主席的书
    毛主席的书，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义经典著作，是一切被压迫人民闹翻身求解放的最强大最锐利的思想武器。全世界革命人民最爱读毛主席的书。没有得到这宝书的人，想尽办法去寻求；已经得到的人，如饥似渴地去阅读。在这亿万人争读毛主席著作的热潮中，每天出现无数动人的故事。下面是我们最近在非洲听到和看到的几个：
    在机场
    一位非洲旅客在某个国际机场换飞机时，在机场旅馆里利用等候飞机的时间阅读他随身带的《毛泽东选集》。他被机场一位工作人员注意到了。这位工作人员随后始终没有离开他，显然有什么心事，又不好开口。上飞机的时间到了，这位旅客小心翼翼地把书装好，准备走向机场。不料，那位机场工作人员却殷勤地为他拿东西，送他上飞机。这种异乎寻常的热心，使他十分纳闷，他正忖度着将会发生什么事情的时候，那位热心的机场工作人员终于鼓起勇气恳切地说：“朋友，是否可以把你的《毛泽东选集》送给我？”他看到那位旅客十分为难，就解释说，他在当地曾经作过许多努力，都一直无法得到《毛泽东选集》。他接着说：“而你呢，你不是还可以在别的什么地方再弄到一部吗？”
    这位旅客虽然舍不得把他心爱的宝书送人，但是他为这位陌生人那种渴望学习毛泽东著作的热情感动了，于是，他取出了一本《毛泽东选集》第三卷，送给这位机场工作人员。后者感到说不出的高兴，连声道谢。
    飞机起飞了。天上那位旅客和地下那位工作人员，他们的国籍不同，连彼此的姓名都不知道，可是，他们共同无限敬仰的伟大的毛泽东思想，他们共同心爱的《毛泽东选集》，把他们连系起来了。
    好极了
    “好极了！”这是非洲自由战士们对新华社新闻稿在封面上印出毛主席语录的第一个反应。他们说，他们每天到办公室的第一件事，就是拿新华社新闻稿，读毛主席语录。
    有些人说，这些语录同当前世界上反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争中的问题有直接联系，因此这些语录是为人们所欢迎的。
    有的人已经能够背诵毛主席语录。一天，有两个非洲人在交谈。一个在背诵：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”当他停下来换气的时候，他的同事马上接下去背诵起来：“从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    另一位非洲自由战士，自从新华社新闻稿印有毛主席语录以来，就开始了一件新的有意义的工作：每天认真地把毛主席语录剪下来，汇集在一起。他决定要把已经发表的毛主席语录收集齐全，并且把这件工作坚持下去。
    禁止不了
    最近，我们遇到一位被某个东欧国家的修正主义领导集团无理驱逐的非洲留学生。他之所以被取消留学生资格，被赶走，“罪名”就是爱读毛主席的书。
    当然，他并不是唯一的受害者。
    他说，在他的还没有获得解放的祖国，毛主席著作被殖民当局列为禁书，读毛主席著作是犯法的。但是他没想到，在一个自称是“社会主义国家”里，阅读毛主席著作竟然也是犯法的。
    但是，驱逐也好，安上什么“罪名”也好，都无法阻止革命人民热爱毛主席著作。这位非洲学生说：“如果你是革命者，你就得读毛主席著作；如果你不是革命者，你就不要读。要想使我们的斗争避免失败，就必须认真学习毛主席著作。”
