With Mao Zedong Thought, our eyes are bright, our hearts are red, we stand firm, and we endure. No matter how fierce the flames, our courage does not waver, our hearts do not race, and our faces do not change color.

We engrave Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, infuse them into our blood, and put them into action.

Fire refines true gold, difficulties test people. True gold fears no fire, the more it is tempered, the harder it becomes.

Steel is forged, and our minds are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With high-quality steel, any precise equipment can be manufactured; with Mao Zedong Thought, any human miracle can be created.

Fire can turn trees into charcoal, but a heart loyal to Chairman Mao cannot be blackened. Flames can destroy steel and iron, but they cannot conquer revolutionary spirits.

The revolutionary cause is our first priority. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our lives.

Human life is precious, but the party's cause is even more precious. For the party's cause, we are willing to be crushed and shattered.

I can sacrifice my life, but I cannot let the party's interests suffer even the slightest loss.

We must be hard men armed with Mao Zedong Thought, be resolute and steadfast oil warriors, and never be like tofu soldiers.

We are born for the revolution and are prepared to die for it. If our death benefits the entire revolutionary cause, it is a worthy death, as heavy as Mount Tai. Those who fear death and cling to life are the most worthless people.

My life is given by the party, and every cell in my body belongs to the party. I can give up everything, but I cannot give up the party's interests.

We are Chairman Mao's oil workers, finding gas and oil for the motherland. As long as the order is given, we will set out immediately, to the ends of the earth, to the corners of the sea, without hesitation or fear.

    真金不怕火，越炼越坚硬
    ——32111钻井队工人豪言壮语
    有了毛泽东思想，眼就亮，心就红，站得稳，顶得住，烈火再大，胆不惊，心不跳，面不改色。
    我们把毛主席的指示，印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。
    烈火炼真金，困难考验人，真金不怕火，越炼越坚硬。
    钢是炼出来的，我们的头脑是毛泽东思想武装起来的。有了优质的钢，什么精密的设备都可以制造出来；有了毛泽东思想，什么人间奇迹也能创造出来。
    火能把树木烧成木炭，忠实于毛主席的红心烧不黑。烈火能毁钢和铁，熊焰难征革命心。
    革命事业是我们的第一生命，毛泽东思想是我们生命的灵魂。
    人的生命可贵，党的事业更可贵。为了党的事业，粉身碎骨也心甘情愿。
    我的生命可以牺牲，绝不能够让党的利益，受到任何一点损失。
    要当毛泽东思想武装起来的硬汉，要当响当当、硬梆梆的石油战士，决不当豆腐兵。
    我们是为革命而生的，也要准备为革命而死。如果我们死了，有利于整个革命利益，就是死得其所，重如泰山。贪生怕死的人，是最没有出息的人。
    我的生命是党给的，我身上每一个细胞都是属于党的。我能舍弃自己的一切，但是党的利益一点也不能舍弃。
    我们是毛主席的石油工人，为祖国找气找油，只要一声令下，我们拔腿就走，走到天涯，走到海角，眉不打结，腿不发抖。
