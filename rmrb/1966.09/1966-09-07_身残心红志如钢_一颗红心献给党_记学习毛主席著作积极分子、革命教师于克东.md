This is a poem of admiration that people have composed for Yu Keding with reverence in their hearts.

Yu Keding, a member of the Communist Party, was originally a worker at the Huainan Coal Mine. In an accident, he lost both of his arms. Under the care and guidance of the Party, through studying Chairman Mao's works, he gradually established a revolutionary worldview, overcame numerous difficulties, used prosthetic limbs to restore his working ability, and is now a literacy teacher at the Huainan Xiejiazhuang No. 2 Mine Workers' Evening School. Over the years, he has been recognized as an advanced worker, a five-star worker, an outstanding teacher, and has attended the Huainan City and Anhui Province cultural and educational heroes' conferences, as well as the city and provincial conferences of active learners of Chairman Mao's works.

Overcoming All Difficulties for the Revolution

In November 1956, Yu Keding was electrocuted while working, severely burning his left arm and seriously injuring his right arm. The mine leadership and doctors took all possible measures to save his life, but after treatment, his left arm was reduced to just two inches, and his right arm to five or six inches.

The sudden loss of both arms was like a bolt from the blue for a young man. He thought: Without hands, how will I work? How will I serve the Party? At this time, the Party organization and comrades gave him warm care and encouragement, urging him to be strong and recover well, and to learn from revolutionary heroes. Yu Keding thought about the past and compared it to the present, deeply feeling the superiority of the socialist system and realizing that pessimism was wrong. He lay in bed, practicing flipping pages with his mouth, reading Chairman Mao's works "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "On the Rectification of the Party's Style of Work," and revolutionary literary works. The more he read, the more he felt close to his heart, and the brighter his mind became. He decided to overcome difficulties and become a useful person.

Two hundred days of hospital life came to an end. After being discharged, the Party organization immediately sent someone to take Yu Keding to Shanghai to have prosthetic hands installed.

To facilitate his education and care, the secretary of the Party branch of the Mechanical and Electrical Department specially moved Yu Keding to live next door. The mine Party committee also brought his parents from their hometown to Huainan and helped him get married. At this time, two paths lay before Yu Keding: one was to sit at home and receive "work injury benefits"; the other was to continue working for the revolution, facing many difficulties to overcome. Yu Keding decided to face the challenges head-on and make his prosthetic hands obedient.

One day, he asked his younger brother to buy paper and a pen, and had his mother tie a dip pen to his prosthetic hand, practicing writing one stroke at a time. At first, the prosthetic limb did not listen to his commands, and after a long time, he could only write one "共" character before the pen fell, and he was sweating profusely. He did not give up and continued to practice.

That day, after practicing writing, Yu Keding felt pain all over his body. His mother, seeing her son's struggle, advised him not to practice anymore. He lay in bed, thinking about the leadership and comrades' care and encouragement, and more importantly, about Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades must learn to look at difficulties in a positive light, to see the bright side, and to raise our spirits." The more he thought, the warmer his heart felt, and the more strength he gained.

The next day, he persuaded his mother, enduring the pain from the previous day's practice, and started practicing again. That day, he finally wrote "Long Live the Communist Party" in five large characters.

He continued to practice writing, moving his prosthetic hands without stopping. The steel wire, originally designed to last two years, broke after just twenty days. He replaced it with iron wire, which broke again after three or five days, so he replaced it again. His back skin was rubbed raw, bleeding, but he treated the injured area while changing the friction point. Over time, his back developed a layer of hard skin, and the iron wire could no longer rub it raw. After two months, not only did he write faster, but his handwriting also improved.

Later, he also practiced writing with chalk and calligraphy brushes. He could write with his prosthetic hands, hold a pen in his mouth, and even write with a pen tied to his residual arm.

In 1958, when the country was reporting great leaps forward on all fronts, Yu Keding, with a heart full of enthusiasm, applied to the Party committee to work at the evening school, determined to share his cultural knowledge with the workers.

A Burning Class Sentiment

In May 1958, Yu Keding took up his new post in adult education.

Yu Keding took charge of a literacy class. He found that some students were absent, so he visited each one individually and made up the missed lessons for them. Some people in the school thought this was a manual approach. However, Yu Keding did not see it that way. He worked with a strong class sentiment to serve the working class in their cultural liberation, running between the workshop and the dormitory for seven years. He not only knew the address and family situation of each student but also knew their production situation and personality traits. He even knew a lot about the affairs of their family members.

During the trial period of workshop-based education in the mine, Yu Keding had to rush from his home to the mine every noon for pre-shift teaching, and in the evenings, he had to go to the evening school and the cultural center outside the mine to teach during leisure activities, which was quite tiring. To improve the students' learning enthusiasm and reading ability, he also borrowed books and magazines from the library, packed them in a first-aid box, and carried them to the collective activity site to distribute to the students. The box, weighing over ten pounds, was unstable on his shoulder, so he turned his head and bit the box strap to carry it away.

An Ideological Instructor

Every time the night was deep, the light in Yu Keding's room was still on. He was reading his favorite book—Chairman Mao's works—diligently. He read and pondered, comparing what Chairman Mao said with what he should do. He read this passage: "Ideological and political work should be the responsibility of every department. The Communist Party should take charge, the Communist Youth League should take charge, the government's responsible departments should take charge, and the school principals and teachers should take charge." Yu Keding asked himself: "I am a literacy teacher, what should I do?"

Someone said: "Literacy is about teaching characters, that's the job." Yu Keding said: "Comrade, you are only talking about a very small part. In a socialist society where class struggle exists, educational work should take class struggle as the key link. It's not just about teaching books; it's more important to teach people."

Yu Keding conducted class education among the students, recalling bitterness and sweetness, arousing class sentiment, strengthening class struggle awareness, and helping students clarify their learning purpose and raise their consciousness. He educated students according to their dynamic thoughts. According to the Party's central work and the mine's production tasks for each period, he taught Chairman Mao's quotations. He also used pre-class time to teach students to read newspapers, propagate domestic and international news, and conduct current affairs and policy education. Some students said: "Teacher Yu is a disabled person, but he still cares about our progress. We have good hands and feet, so our thoughts should not be disabled!"

Over the past seven years, Yu Keding has, through his hard work, taught many workers to study Chairman Mao's works, write letters, and write family histories, enabling them to pick up pens to denounce the darkness of the old society, sing the praises of the bright new socialist China, and sing the praises of our great Party and great leader Chairman Mao.

Forever Maintaining the Revolutionary Spirit

According to Yu Keding's physical condition, the mine regulations did not allow him to engage in physical labor. However, he believed: Intellectuals must roll in the mud on the ground and roll in coal underground to gradually cultivate the sentiment of the working class and gradually achieve the revolutionization of thought. Even if one comes from a working-class family, if one is detached from labor for a long time, one will lose the characteristics of the working people, lose the sentiment of the working class, and lose the revolutionary spirit. Therefore, he actively participated in every labor task of the school.

When the teachers dug the ground, he could not hold a shovel without hands, so he stood by and helped stomp on the shovel with his feet. When the teachers carried soil to pave the road, he was not allowed to carry it, so he went to the side to stomp on the newly laid soil with his feet. He often said: "Communist Party members should take the lead in everything, suffer first, and enjoy later. I don't consider myself a disabled person, and others won't consider me a disabled person either."

Yu Keding remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Modesty helps one make progress, while arrogance leads to backwardness." He maintained a humble and prudent attitude and often said: "My life is given by the Party, my thoughts are armed by the Party, and my work has achieved some small successes with the help of everyone. Without the Party's education and cultivation, without everyone's support and help, what could I do? Even with achievements, they belong to the Party and the people." To express his resolve to revolutionize forever, he once wrote this poem:

The Party gave me life,
The Party gave me strength,
My heart is filled with the sunshine of spring;
My body is disabled, but my heart is not,
My will is as firm as steel,
For the construction of socialist culture,
I will contribute all my strength.

    身残心红志如钢　一颗红心献给党
    ——记学习毛主席著作积极分子、革命教师于克东
    学习“毛著”心明亮，
    双臂虽失志如钢；
    假肢挥笔传文化，
    一颗红心献给党。
    这是人们怀着崇敬的心情，送给于克东的一首赞诗。
    共产党员于克东原来是淮南煤矿的工人，在一次意外事故中他失去了双臂。在党的关怀和教育下，通过学习毛主席著作，逐步树立了革命世界观，克服了重重困难，利用假肢，恢复了工作能力，现在他是淮南谢家集二矿职工业余学校的扫盲教师。几年来，他先后被评为先进工作者、五好工人、优秀教师，出席过淮南市和安徽省的文教群英会以及市、省的学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会。
    排除万难为革命
    一九五六年十一月，于克东在劳动中不幸触电，烧焦了左臂，右臂伤势也极严重。矿领导和医生采取了一切措施，保全了他的生命，但经过治疗，左臂只剩二寸，右臂只剩五六寸。
    一个青年突然失去了双臂，这真是晴天霹雳。他想：没有手，将来怎么劳动？怎么为党工作？这时，党组织和同志们给了他以热情的关怀，鼓励他坚强起来好好养伤，向革命英雄人物学习。于克东想想过去，比比现在，深深体会到社会主义制度的优越性，认识到悲观情绪是错误的。他躺在床上，练习着用嘴翻书，阅读着毛主席著作《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》和革命的文艺作品。他越读越觉得亲切，心里越明亮，决心战胜困难，做个有用的人。
    二百多天的医院生活结束了。出院后，党组织立即派专人送于克东到上海，为他安装了假手。
    为了便于对他进行教育和照顾他的生活，机电科党总支书记特地让于克东搬到自己隔壁住，矿党委又把他父母从老家接到淮南，并且帮助他成了家。这时，摆在于克东面前的有两条路：一条是坐在家里吃“劳保”；另一条是继续为革命工作，这样就有许许多多困难等待他去克服。于克东决心迎难而进，叫假手听话。
    一天，他叫弟弟买来纸和笔，让母亲把蘸水笔绑在自己的假手上，一笔一划地练习写字。起初，假肢怎么也不听使唤，老半天只写出了一个“共”字，笔就掉了，累得脸上冒出大汗珠。他没有灰心，继续练下去。
    这一天练完字，于克东觉得浑身疼痛，妈妈心疼儿子，劝他不要再练了。他躺在床上，想起了领导和同志们的关怀、鼓励，更想起了毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”他越想越觉得心里热呼呼的，越想越觉得有劲。
    第二天，他说服了母亲，忍着前一天练字所留下的余痛，又开始练起来了。这一天终于写出了“共产党万岁”五个碗口大的字来。
    他继续不断地练习写字，假手不停地活动，原来设计规定使用两年的钢丝，只用了二十天就断掉了。他用铁丝代替，用三五天又断了，就再更换一次。脊背上的皮肤磨破了，流出了鲜血，他一边治疗磨破了的伤口，一边更换磨擦的位置。这样，久而久之，他的脊背上长起一层硬皮，铁丝来回抽动，再也磨不破了。两个多月后，不仅写得快，而且写的字也好看了。
    以后，他又先后练会写粉笔、毛笔字。他能用假手写，也能用嘴噙着笔写，还能用残臂绑着钢笔写。
    一九五八年，正当祖国各条战线上纷纷传出大跃进捷报时，于克东怀着满腔热情，向党委提出到业余学校去工作的要求，决心把自己的文化知识教给工人。
    火热的阶级感情
    一九五八年五月一日，于克东走上了业余教育工作的新岗位。
    于克东担任了一个扫盲班的教师。他发现有部分学员缺课，就一个一个地访问，一个一个地给他们补上所缺的课。学校中有人认为，这是手工业方式。但是，于克东不是这样认识的。他是带着为工人阶级在文化上彻底翻身服务的强烈的阶级感情来工作的，他七年如一日地在车间和宿舍中奔忙。他不仅对每个学员的住址和家庭情况了如指掌，而且知道他们的生产情况和性格特点，就连家属中的事情，他也知道很多。
    在矿里试行车间办学期间，于克东每天中午要从家里赶到矿内进行班前教学，早晚又要跑到矿外业余学校和中心俱乐部，利用业余活动时间教学，是够辛苦的了。他为了提高学员的学习情绪和阅读能力，还从图书馆借了图书、画报，用一只救护箱装起来，背到集体活动场所，分发给学员看。十多斤重的箱子背在肩上稳不住，他就扭过头来，用牙咬着箱子带走。
    思想教员
    每当夜深，于克东住的房子里的电灯仍然在亮着。他正在孜孜不倦地阅读着他最爱读的书——毛主席著作。他阅读着、思索着。看看毛主席是怎样讲的，自己应该怎样做。他读到了这一段话：“思想政治工作，各个部门都要负责任。共产党应该管，青年团应该管，政府主管部门应该管，学校的校长教师更应该管。”于克东向自己提出了这样一个问题：“我是个扫盲教师，应该怎么办？”
    有人说：“扫盲扫盲，教识字是本行。”于克东说：“同志，你说的仅仅是一个很小的部分。在存在着阶级斗争的社会主义时期，教育工作要以阶级斗争为纲，不光是教书，最重要的是教人。”
    于克东在学员中开展忆苦思甜的阶级教育，激发学员的阶级感情，增强学员的阶级斗争观念，同时帮助学员明确学习的目的，提高学员的自觉性。针对学员的活思想，他随时进行教育。他根据每个时期党的中心工作和矿里的生产任务，选教毛主席语录。他还利用课前时间教学员读报纸，宣传国内外大事，进行时事政策教育。有些学员说：“于老师是残废人，还关心我们进步，我们好手好脚，思想可不能残废啊！”
    七年多来，于克东用他的辛勤劳动，教许多工人学习毛主席著作，学写信、写家史，使他们能够拿起笔来控诉旧社会的黑暗，歌颂社会主义新中国的光明，歌颂我们伟大的党和伟大领袖毛主席。
    永远保持革命精神
    根据于克东的身体情况，矿里规定不让他参加体力劳动。但是他认为：知识分子只有在地上滚上一身泥，在井下滚上一身煤，才能逐步培养起工人阶级的感情，才能逐步实现思想革命化。即使出身在劳动人民家庭的人，如果长期脱离劳动，也就会失掉劳动人民的本色，失掉工人阶级的感情，失掉革命精神。因此，学校的每一次劳动他都积极参加。
    老师们挖地，他没有手不能拿铁锹，就站在旁边，用脚帮助踩铁锹。教员们抬土铺路，不让他抬，他就到一边去用脚踩平新垫的土。他常说：“共产党员要事事带头，吃苦在前，享乐在后，我不把自己当成残废人，别人也就不会把我当残废人看待了。”
    于克东牢记毛主席的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，保持谦虚谨慎的态度，他常说：“我的生命是党给的，我的思想是党武装的，我的工作做出一些小成绩，是大家帮助的。没有党的教育和培养，没有大家的支持和帮助，我能干啥。有成绩也属于党和人民。”为了表达他的永远革命的决心，他曾经写了这样一首诗：
    党给我生命，
    给我力量，
    我心灵里充满了春天的阳光；
    我身残心不残，
    意志坚如钢，
    为了社会主义的文化建设，
    我要贡献出一切力量。
