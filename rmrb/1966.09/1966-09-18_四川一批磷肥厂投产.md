	Recently, Sichuan has started production at a batch of newly built medium and small-sized phosphate fertilizer plants. Another batch of similar phosphate fertilizer plants are currently installing equipment and will gradually start production in the fourth quarter.

	This year is the year with the most chemical fertilizer plants built in Sichuan since liberation. Thirty medium and small-sized phosphate fertilizer plants are planned to be built, with an annual production capacity of 760,000 tons. Now, 13 plants with a production capacity of 230,000 tons have been completed and put into production.

	With the increase in the number of phosphate fertilizer plants, the province's phosphate fertilizer production in the first eight months of this year has already exceeded last year's annual production, playing a significant role in supporting agricultural increase.

	In the process of building phosphate fertilizer plants, local resources, financial strength, and technical expertise were fully utilized. The principle of self-reliance as the mainstay, with state support as a supplement, was thoroughly implemented, achieving the results of being more, faster, better, and more economical.

    四川一批磷肥厂投产
    据新华社成都十七日电　最近，四川又有一批新建的中小型磷肥厂投入生产。还有一批同样的磷肥厂正在安装设备，将在第四季度陆续投入生产。
    今年是解放以来四川省兴办化肥厂最多的一年。计划兴办的中小型磷肥厂三十个，年产能力七十六万吨，现在已有生产能力二十三万吨、十三个厂建成投入生产。
    磷肥厂增多后，今年全省头八个月生产的磷肥，已超过去年全年产量，对支援农业增产起了很大作用。
    兴办磷肥厂过程中，各地充分依靠当地的物力、财力和技术力量，认真贯彻以自力更生为主，国家支援为辅的精神，收到又多、又快、又好、又省的效果。
