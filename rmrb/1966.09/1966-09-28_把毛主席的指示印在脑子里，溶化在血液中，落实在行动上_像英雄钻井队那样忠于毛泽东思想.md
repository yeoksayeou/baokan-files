	Imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in your mind, dissolve them in your blood, and implement them in your actions. Be like the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team in your loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought.

	The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and the Political Departments of Agriculture and Forestry, Finance and Trade, and the All-China Women's Federation have each issued notices calling for the study of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated September 27, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army issued a notice calling on the entire army to widely promote and study the activities of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team. The notice requires all companies and grassroots units to take the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team as an example and build themselves into heroic collectives armed with Mao Zedong Thought. All cadres and soldiers, especially leading cadres, should also take the drill team's heroes as examples, "imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in your mind, dissolve them in your blood, and implement them in your actions," to become revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

	The notice states that the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team is a heroic collective that emerged in the high tide of the seven hundred million people in China studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They defended the country's property and the people's interests with their lives and blood. Their lofty qualities and heroic deeds as a working class are another triumphant song of great Mao Zedong Thought that resonates through the clouds!

	The notice points out that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the revolutionary people. The glorious deeds of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team once again prove that as long as one masters this powerful ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, one can create earth-shattering miracles and give rise to countless revolutionary heroes who are fearless of knife mountains and fire seas.

	The notice emphasizes that the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our army must adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, raise it to a new level, and be more tightly grasped and more effectively implemented. In promoting and studying the activities of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team, we must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to study Chairman Mao's works extensively, establish Mao Zedong Thought firmly, and work hard on putting it into practice. We must forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever highlight proletarian politics, forever maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit, and truly turn our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

	In promoting and studying the activities of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team, we must learn from their thorough revolutionary spirit, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' initiative, actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and resolutely defend it. Every cadre and soldier must temper and transform themselves in this great storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Currently, we are in a new era of world revolution, and the situation is excellent worldwide. In order to save its doomed fate, American imperialism is continuing to expand its aggression in Vietnam and is constantly making crazy war provocations against our country. In promoting and studying the activities of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team, we must learn from their high revolutionary heroism, fearing neither hardship nor death, and according to Chairman Mao's people's war thought, do a solid job of preparing for war, be ready at any time to smash a possible sudden attack by American imperialism and its accomplices, defend our great socialist motherland, and support the revolutionary struggles of the world's people.

	The notice requires all levels of people's armed forces to widely propagate the glorious deeds of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team and organize them to study seriously.

	According to a summary of Xinhua News Agency reports dated September 27, the Political Departments of the Communist Party of China's Agriculture and Forestry, Finance and Trade, and the All-China Women's Federation issued notices today, calling on workers in the national agriculture, forestry, finance, and trade sectors, and women across the country to learn from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team. Take this heroic collective as an example, make reading Chairman Mao's books a primary need in life, turn Mao Zedong Thought into one's soul, turn executing Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious actions, and regard revolutionary interests as one's first life.

	The notices emphasize that to learn from the heroes' thoughts, walk the heroes' path, and create heroes' achievements, the most fundamental thing is to learn from them "imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in your mind, dissolve them in your blood, and implement them in your actions"; learn from their unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, to the Party, to the people, and to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The notices also require everyone to learn from the 32111 drilling team heroes' fearlessness in the face of danger, their willingness to brave fire and water, and their self-sacrificing spirit; learn from their unity and concerted efforts, their courageous advance, and their proletarian collective heroism; learn from their selflessness, their fearlessness of hardship and death, their dedication to revolution, and their everything-for-the-people high-minded communist qualities.

	These three units' notices require all levels of agriculture, forestry, finance, trade, and women's federations to push the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high tide, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, seize the revolution, promote production, and ensure the dual victory of revolution and production construction, making greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction.
