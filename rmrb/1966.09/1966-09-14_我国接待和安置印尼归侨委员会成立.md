The Chinese government and people are outraged by the brutal persecution of Chinese nationals by the Indonesian fascist military regime and deeply concerned for the welfare of the Chinese nationals suffering in Indonesia. Staff from relevant departments, following Chairman Mao's directive to serve the people wholeheartedly, have completed all preparations for the reception and settlement of returning Chinese nationals.

	New China News Agency, September 13th: To receive and settle Chinese nationals who have been persecuted by the Indonesian government and wish to return to China, the People's Republic of China Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese has been established. The Chairman of the Committee is Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China.

	The Committee has eight Vice-Chairmen and twenty-one members. The Vice-Chairmen are: Fang Fang, Vice-Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Zhao Ziyang, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee; Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee; Wei Guoqing, First Secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee; Yan Hongyan, First Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee; Chen Manyuan, Deputy Minister of the State Farm Administration; Lin Yixin and Lin Xiude, Vice-Chairmen of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.

	The Director of the Office of the People's Republic of China Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese is Fang Fang, with Deputy Directors Lin Xiude and Wu Jisheng.

	New China News Agency, September 13th: A spokesperson for the People's Republic of China Committee for Receiving and Settling Returning Overseas Chinese said today that the Chinese government and people have deep concern for the Chinese nationals suffering in Indonesia. Staff from relevant departments, following Chairman Mao's directive to serve the people wholeheartedly, have completed all preparations for the reception and settlement of Chinese nationals who wish to return to China from Indonesia.

	The spokesperson said that the Chinese nationals who have lived in Indonesia for generations have suffered brutal persecution from the Indonesian fascist military regime. Many have been wrongfully killed, and countless have lost their homes and belongings, becoming refugees. We are outraged by this. He said that as early as May this year, the Chinese government had informed the Indonesian government of its decision to send ships to receive Chinese nationals who wish to return to China, but this was repeatedly delayed and obstructed by the Indonesian government. After repeated negotiations by the Chinese government, the Indonesian government only recently agreed to allow the first Chinese ship to dock at the port of Medan in Indonesia.

	The spokesperson said that the crew of the reception ship, filled with indignation towards the Indonesian government's persecution of Chinese nationals and deep concern for the suffering of their fellow Chinese nationals, have studied Chairman Mao's works repeatedly over the past few months. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's directive to "resolutely overcome difficulties and strive for victory" and will surely complete the glorious task of receiving Chinese nationals entrusted to them by the Chinese people.

	The spokesperson expressed that the units responsible for settling the returning Chinese nationals have made proper arrangements for their living, work, and study. The spokesperson said that the Chinese people eagerly await the Chinese nationals suffering in Indonesia to overcome difficulties and return to China victoriously, to participate in China's great socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    我国接待和安置印尼归侨委员会成立
    祖国政府和人民对印尼法西斯军事当局疯狂迫害华侨万分愤慨，对处在水深火热中的受害华侨无限关怀。各有关部门的工作人员按照毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导，已经做好各项接运和安置准备工作。

    新华社十三日讯　中华人民共和国接待和安置归国华侨委员会负责人今天对记者说，祖国政府和祖国人民对处在水深火热之中的印度尼西亚受害华侨无限关怀，各有关部门工作人员按照毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导，已经做好接运和安置印度尼西亚自愿返国受害华侨的各项准备工作。
    负责人说，世代居留在印度尼西亚的广大华侨，遭到了印度尼西亚法西斯军事当局的疯狂迫害。不少华侨无辜被害，大批华侨倾家荡产，流离失所。我们对此感到万分愤慨。他说，早在今年五月，中国政府就已照会印度尼西亚政府，决定派船前往接运自愿返国的受害华侨，但受到了印度尼西亚政府的一再拖延和阻挠。经过中国政府反复据理交涉，印度尼西亚政府直到最近才同意中国第一艘接侨船只开往印度尼西亚棉兰港口。
    负责人说，接侨船的船员们怀着对印度尼西亚政府迫害华侨罪行的无比愤怒和对受害侨胞的深情关注，几个月来反复学习了毛主席著作，决心按照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，一定要出色地完成祖国人民交付给自己的光荣的接侨任务。
    负责人表示：准备安置即将回到祖国怀抱的受害华侨的各个单位，已为受害华侨的生活、生产和学习作了妥善安排。负责人说，祖国人民热切盼望印度尼西亚受害华侨冲破困难，胜利地回到祖国，参加祖国伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业。
