Soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region recently re-studied Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and discussed their learning experiences. They unanimously agreed that over the past 22 years, Chairman Mao's brilliant work has armed the entire Party, the entire army, and the broad masses of the people, enabling the Chinese revolution to achieve great victories. Today, as the socialist revolution enters a new stage, further studying this work has even greater significance. Everyone is determined to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" for life and truly become revolutionaries who serve the people completely and thoroughly.

Be resolute in revolution to the end, which is the greatest service to the people

The soldiers and officers said that in his brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is a people's army. It is entirely for the people's interests. It fights for the people's interests and not for any private ends." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings has deepened. Everyone believes that to serve the people completely, thoroughly, and wholeheartedly, we must first be forever loyal to the Party, to the people, to Chairman Mao, and to Mao Zedong Thought. We must unyieldingly carry the proletarian revolution through to the end and become thorough revolutionaries.

Five-good soldier Zhang Ruiming said that Chairman Mao teaches us that after the proletariat seizes political power, there is still the danger of losing it. After the establishment of the socialist system, there is still the danger of capitalist restoration. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has exposed a large number of facts that powerfully demonstrate this point. In the new stage of the socialist revolution, the standard for serving the people has become even higher. The most fundamental criterion for judging whether a person serves the people completely and thoroughly is whether he follows Chairman Mao's teachings and becomes a steadfast and thorough revolutionary. Soldier Li Huicheng and Huang Wencong said that the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat over whether to restore or prevent restoration, which concerns the fate of the Chinese and world revolutions and is in the fundamental interests of the people. Actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and striving for its complete victory is our greatest service to the people. We must hold the gun in one hand, stay alert, strengthen our combat readiness, and be prepared at any moment to smash a sudden attack by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs; with the other hand, we must pick up the pen and actively participate in criticizing the bourgeoisie. This is the glorious combat mission of every revolutionary.

The soldiers and officers believe that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest ideological weapon to ensure that we forever remain young in revolution and that our Party and country will never change color. Actively propagating Mao Zedong Thought among the people and arming the masses with Mao Zedong Thought is the most important aspect of serving the people and is the lifelong combat mission of every revolutionary. Many soldiers and officers said that during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our unit conducted nearly two months of long-distance wilderness training. Wherever we went, we propagated Mao Zedong Thought, achieving "red wherever we go, red wherever we stay." We received praise from the broad masses. Many community members held the soldiers' hands and said, "You are truly Chairman Mao's good soldiers, the people's good servants. You brought us what we need most—Mao Zedong Thought. This is the greatest service to the people!"

The more firmly the roots of serving the people are planted, the higher the consciousness of serving the people will be

The soldiers and officers believe that "In Memory of Norman Bethune" is an important document for ideological and political work. Only by studying it well can we firmly plant the roots of serving the people and always, in every matter and at every moment, consciously put the people's interests first and be the people's faithful servants. No matter how work, tasks, time, place, and conditions change, the ideology and actions of serving the people will never change.

The soldiers and officers of this unit mostly participated in the struggle last winter to overcome the tidal wave in Bohai Bay, contributing to the protection of the local people's lives and property and receiving commendations from the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army. Many soldiers and officers said that when the tidal wave suddenly struck Bohai Bay, threatening the lives and property of the people, and the salt fields and salt mountains were about to be swallowed by the sea, although we had not yet received orders from higher-ups, we all remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, and every policy must serve the people's interests." This is the highest order. Therefore, at that time, the soldiers and officers of various companies who were scattered along the 200-plus-mile-long Bohai Bay coast for political training all spontaneously rushed to the dikes to fight against the tidal wave. Fifth Company Platoon Leader Sun Xue Meng said, "Firmly establishing the ideology of serving the people and being forever loyal to the people enables us to always put the people's interests first at every moment. After the tidal wave struck, we defended the dikes in the Li Family Village area. The dikes were struck by the surging sea waves several times, creating breaches, and the sea water rushed into the village. To defend the dikes, the soldiers, without regard for the danger of being swept away by the sea waves, jumped into the sea and formed a human wall to block the fierce waves rushing towards them. Everyone said, 'As long as we are here, the dikes will stand.' The people's lives and property are paramount; personal safety is nothing! Later, the soldiers discovered that the fish factory was surrounded by water, and state property would be damaged, so they bravely waded through the ten-plus-meter-wide water-filled ditch and rushed to rescue it. In the struggle against the tidal wave, the soldiers were all at the forefront, vying to go to the most dangerous places, but when it came to evaluating merits, no one wanted to speak up. New recruit Song Decheng rescued an old woman and two children but told no one. It was only when the old woman led the children to his door to express gratitude that everyone found out. But Song Decheng said, 'Serving the people is my duty!'"

Third Company Squad Leader Li Guanghui said, "The more firmly the roots of serving the people are planted, the higher the consciousness of serving the people will be. In August this year, the unit conducted wilderness training in the Shanhaiguan area and conducted swimming training. Everyone discovered that the large cornfields of the local commune were infested with pests, so the soldiers all requested to temporarily suspend swimming training and help the commune eliminate the pests and ensure a bumper harvest. In the struggle against pests, the soldiers crawled in the green nets, feeling hot and stuffy, and their faces and hands were cut by the corn leaves, making them painful and unbearable when soaked in sweat. But everyone thought that this was to protect the people's interests and serve the people, so no one complained or felt tired.

Study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" for life and serve the people for life

During the discussion, many soldiers and officers said: The ideology of serving the people is nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought and is not spontaneously generated. As the socialist revolution deepens, every revolutionary must study Chairman Mao's works diligently and apply them in practice, better study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and strive to eliminate the "self" to thoroughly reform one's worldview, in order to keep up with the revolutionary situation and truly serve the people completely and thoroughly.

Wu Ji, the political instructor of a certain artillery company who had distinguished himself in the struggle against the tidal wave, spoke about his experiences in repeatedly studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and reforming his thoughts. He said that when he first took on the role of instructor, his work was not well-done, and the soldiers gave him a lot of feedback at the year-end evaluation. Initially, he felt wronged, so he opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and studied it. He repeatedly read a passage from Chairman Mao's instructions: "Since we are serving the people, we should not be afraid of criticism and pointing out our shortcomings." This made him realize that being able to correctly handle criticism and self-criticism is an important criterion for judging whether a person is wholeheartedly serving the people and whether he can wholeheartedly serve the people. From then on, he humbly accepted the opinions of the masses, and his work improved significantly. He said, "We are doing revolution, and every day we must study 'In Memory of Norman Bethune,' apply it in practice, and examine our every action according to Chairman Mao's teachings, achieving the goal of studying 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' for life and serving the people for life."

Five-good soldier Zhu Yongfei said that to serve the people well, one must first study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently and thoroughly reform one's worldview. He summarized his experiences in studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" into four sentences: "Study hard, compare often, learn and apply together, and be clear about consciously studying and not being vague, with reforming one's worldview as the first condition."

The soldiers and officers unanimously believe that transforming one's worldview is a fundamental transformation. To revolutionize for life, one must study Chairman Mao's works for life and reform one's thoughts for life. "In Memory of Norman Bethune" is the best weapon for reforming one's thoughts and transforming one's worldview. As the socialist revolution deepens, the standards for serving the people and the requirements for ideological reform are becoming higher, which is a revolutionary need. The remnants of bourgeois and all exploiting classes' old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits in our minds are obstacles and stumbling blocks to our wholeheartedly serving the people. Every revolutionary must have sufficient awareness of this point. Everyone expressed that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will further study "In Memory of Norman Bethune" better, work hard on reforming their worldviews, and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought to truly become revolutionaries who serve the people completely and thoroughly.

    做坚定的革命派　完全彻底为人民服务
    ——北京部队某部指战员畅谈学习《为人民服务》的体会
    新华社十二日讯　人民解放军北京部队某部指战员，最近重新学习了《为人民服务》，畅谈学习心得，大家一致认为，二十二年来，毛主席这一光辉著作，武装了全党、全军指战员和广大人民，使中国革命取得了伟大的胜利。在社会主义革命进入新阶段的今天，进一步学好这篇著作，就有着更加重大的意义。大家决心学一辈子《为人民服务》，真正做一个完全、彻底为人民服务的革命战士。
    坚决革命到底，是最大的为人民服务
    指战员们说，毛主席在《为人民服务》这篇光辉著作中教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们对毛主席这一教导的认识更加深刻了。大家认为，要做到完全、彻底、全心全意地为人民服务，首先必须永远忠于党，忠于人民，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，坚定不移地把无产阶级革命进行到底，做彻底的革命派。
    五好战士张瑞明说，毛主席教导我们，无产阶级夺取了政权，还存在丧失政权的危险，社会主义制度建立以后，还存在资本主义复辟的危险。文化大革命中揭露出来的大量事实，有力地说明了这一点。在社会主义革命的新阶段，为人民服务的标准越来越高了。衡量一个人是不是完全、彻底地为人民服务，最根本的标准，就是看他是不是按照毛主席的教导，做坚定的彻底的革命派。战士李惠清、黄文霆说，当前正在进行的文化大革命，是一场资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争，关系到中国革命和世界革命的命运，是人民群众的根本利益所在。积极参加文化大革命，争取文化大革命的完全胜利，就是我们最大地为人民服务。我们要一手握紧枪杆，提高警惕，加强战备，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的突然袭击；一手拿起笔杆，积极参加批判资产阶级。这是每个革命者的光荣的战斗任务。
    指战员们认为，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是保证我们永葆革命青春，保证我们的党和国家永不变色的最强大的思想武器。积极向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装广大群众，是为人民服务的最重要方面，也是每个革命战士毕生的战斗任务。许多指战员说，在文化大革命高潮中，我们部队举行了近两个月的千里野营，走到哪里，就把毛泽东思想宣传到哪里，做到了“走起来红一线，住下来红一片”，受到广大群众的赞扬。许多社员拉着战士的手说：“你们真是毛主席的好战士，人民的好勤务员。你们给我们送来最最需要的毛泽东思想，是最大的为人民服务！”
      为人民服务的思想根子扎得越牢，为
  人民服务的自觉性就越高
    指战员们认为，《为人民服务》是一篇思想革命化建设的重要文献，学好它，才能把为人民服务的思想根子扎得牢，才能时时、事事、处处自觉地把人民利益放在第一位，做人民的忠实勤务员。尽管工作、任务、时间、地点、条件千变万化，为人民服务的思想和行动永远不会变。
    这个部队的指战员，大都参加过去年冬天战胜渤海湾海啸的斗争，为保护当地人民群众的生命财产作出了贡献，受到人民解放军总政治部的表扬。许多指战员说，当渤海湾突然发生海啸，人民群众生命财产受到严重威胁，一片片盐田，一座座盐山，眼看就要被海水吞没时，尽管还没有接到上级的命令，但是，我们都牢记着毛主席的教导：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益”，这就是最高的命令。因此，当时分散在沿渤海湾二百多里长的各个村庄进行政治野营的各连指战员，都自动地冲上海堤，和海啸搏斗。五连排长孙学梦说：“牢固地树立起为人民服务，永远忠于人民的思想，就能做到每时每刻都把人民利益放在第一位。海啸发生以后，我们在李家堡一带护堤。海堤被汹涌的海浪几次冲击，出现了缺口，海水猛烈地往村里冲去。为了护堤，战士们不顾有被海涛卷去的危险，奋不顾身地跳下海去，筑成一道人墙，用身体挡住凶猛扑来的巨浪，大家说，人在堤在。人民生命财产高于一切，个人安危算不了什么！后来，战士们发现鱼厂被水围困，国家财产将受损失，又奋勇地涉水越过十多米宽的积水深沟，冲过去抢救。在战海啸的斗争中，战士们个个冲在前面，争着到最危险的地方去，可是，在评功时，谁也不愿说自己。刚入伍的宋德成救护了一个老大娘、两个小孩，对谁也没有说，直到老大娘领着孩子找上门来感谢时，大家才知道。而宋德成却说，为人民服务，是我应尽的责任！”
    三机连班长李光辉说，为人民服务的思想根子扎得越牢，为人民服务的自觉性就越高。今年八月，部队在山海关一带野营，进行游泳训练。大家发现驻地人民公社的大片玉米地受到虫害，战士们纷纷要求暂停游泳训练，帮助公社除虫害，保丰收。在除虫斗争中，战士们钻在青纱帐里，又闷又热，脸和手被玉米叶割破后，被汗水一渍，疼痛难忍，可是，大家想到这是维护人民群众的利益，是为人民服务，没有一个人叫苦叫累。
  学一辈子《为人民服务》，为人民服务一辈子
    在座谈中，许多指战员说：为人民服务的思想，是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育起来的，不是自发地产生的。随着社会主义革命的深入发展，每一个革命战士都必须活学活用毛主席著作，更好地学习《为人民服务》，狠斗“我”字，彻底改造世界观，才能跟上革命形势，做到完全、彻底为人民服务。
    曾在战海啸的斗争中立过功的某炮连政治指导员武计，在谈到自己反复学习《为人民服务》、改造思想的体会时说，刚担任指导员时，工作没有抓好，年终四好总评时，战士给他提了不少意见。起初，他感到委屈，就翻开《为人民服务》这篇文章学习，他反复读毛主席指示的一段话：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”使他认识到能不能正确对待批评与自我批评，是衡量一个人是不是全心全意为人民服务，能不能全心全意为人民服务的重要标准。从此，他虚心地听取群众的意见，工作有了很大改进。他说，我们干革命，每天都要学习《为人民服务》，活学活用，按照毛主席的教导，对照、检查自己的一举一动，做到学一辈子《为人民服务》，为人民服务一辈子。
    五好战士朱永飞说，要为人民服务得好，必须首先活学活用毛主席著作，彻底改造好世界观。他把自己学习《为人民服务》的体会归纳为四句话：“勤学苦钻多对照，学用结合要记牢，自觉学习别含糊，改造思想第一条。”
    指战员们一致认为，世界观的转变是根本的转变。干一辈子革命，就要学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想。《为人民服务》这篇著作就是改造思想、转变世界观的最好的武器。随着社会主义革命的深入发展，为人民服务的标准，思想改造的要求，越来越高了，这是革命的需要。我们头脑里残存的资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，则是我们全心全意为人民服务的障碍和绊脚石。每一个革命者对这一点都必须有足够的认识。大家表示，在文化大革命运动中，要更好地进一步学好《为人民服务》，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，大立毛泽东思想，真正做一个完全、彻底为人民服务的革命战士。（附图片）
