More than 200 Burmese friends watched the Chinese large-scale color documentary musical and dance epic "The East Is Red" in Rangoon on the evening of the 16th. When Mao Zedong's image appeared on the screen, the audience erupted in thunderous applause. In expressing their impressions after the screening, they enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

A young person said: "Modern revisionists are soft-boned; they surrender to American imperialism. But the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have always held high the banner of revolution. The eyes of revolutionary people all over the world are looking at Beijing, looking at Mao Zedong!"

A Burmese friend said: "From Jinggangshan to Beijing, this is the victorious path that the Chinese people have walked. This is also the victorious path walked under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought."

Another Burmese friend excitedly said: "The Chinese people have such a great leader as Chairman Mao, this is your greatest happiness. Every achievement that the Chinese people have made is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought!"

A Burmese peace fighter said: "The people of the world should follow Mao Zedong and walk the path indicated by Mao Zedong. Let the whole world turn red!"

The Burmese friends highly praised the film, saying: "We have never seen such a good film!" "This is the best revolutionary film in the world!" "This film gives people courage, confidence, and strength!"

The Burmese friends watched this film at a reception hosted by the Chinese Ambassador to Burma, Geng Biao.

A Burmese primary school teacher said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. All people who want revolution must read the works of Chairman Mao Zedong."
