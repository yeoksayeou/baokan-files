During the three years of difficulty, Lin Mofan went into battle bare-chested, collaborating with the counter-revolutionary revisionists of the China East is Red Drama Troupe (formerly the China Youth Art Troupe), working together from within and without, conspiring from top to bottom. They produced a large number of bad plays in the troupe, launching a frenzied attack on the Party. In 1962, the ghosts and demons in society stirred up a wave of rehabilitation, and Lin Mofan conspired with Yang Hansheng to quickly release the poisonous weed that glorified traitors—*Li Xucheng*.

In 1962, he also personally promoted another poisonous weed, the foreign classical play *The Marriage of Figaro*. Lin Mofan, breaking with convention, watched the rehearsal after only two acts were completed, personally "guiding" and "encouraging" it. He said, "The performance of this play still has contemporary significance!" He often called to inquire about the rehearsal situation and designated this play as the troupe's first "rejuvenated" production in three years. Premier Zhou saw the performance and criticized it twice, opposing the performance of this play. However, Lin Mofan publicly opposed Premier Zhou, saying that the play "had no problems."

Even more infuriating was in May 1962, when a small group of revisionists, with ulterior motives, presented the big poisonous weed *Drafting Soldiers* as a "tribute" play to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Mao Zedong's *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*. This play even received the approval and support of Zhou Yang and Lin Mofan. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek was madly advocating for a counterattack on the mainland. This group of anti-Party elements, on the eve of the performance, made blatant revisions to the script, especially adding a scene of "Chiang Kai-shek issuing a commission," shamelessly engaging in counter-revolutionary propaganda. Once this poisonous weed was released, Lin Mofan personally rushed to the backstage to congratulate the successful performance, instructing that *Drafting Soldiers* be listed as a preserved play, and organized an unprecedented "discussion meeting," lavishly praising it. In the end, they even filmed it, spreading its poison throughout the country. This fully exposed their organized, planned, and purposeful counter-revolutionary restoration activities, turning the socialist stage into a reactionary stronghold for them to shoot dark arrows and black guns at the Party.

    三株毒草一条根
    在三年困难时期，林默涵赤膊上阵，和中国东方红话剧院（原中国青年艺术剧院）的反革命修正主义分子，里应外合，上下勾结，在剧院炮制了大量的坏剧目，猖狂地向党进攻。一九六二年，社会上的牛鬼蛇神刮起了一阵翻案风，林默涵和阳翰笙共谋，急忙把美化叛徒的一棵毒草——《李秀成》放了出来。
    一九六二年，他在剧院又一手扶植了另外一株毒草外国古典戏《费加罗的婚姻》。林默涵一反常规，戏刚刚排了两幕，就来看连排，亲临“指导”，倍加“鼓励”。他说：“这个戏的演出还是有现实意义的！”他经常打电话询问排演情况，并把这个戏封为剧院三年来的第一个“翻身戏”。周总理看了演出，两次提出批评，反对演这个戏，而林默涵公开与周总理唱反调，说这个戏“没什么问题”。
    更令人愤怒的是一九六二年五月，一小撮修正主义分子别有用心地把大毒草《抓壮丁》作为纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年的“献礼”剧目，竟也得到周扬、林默涵的批准和支持。当时正是蒋介石疯狂叫嚣反攻大陆的时候，这伙反党分子，在演出的前一天，对剧本做了露骨的修改，特别加了“蒋介石发委任状”这么一场戏，肆无忌惮地进行反革命宣传。这棵毒草一出笼，林默涵亲自跑到后台祝贺演出成功，指示要把《抓壮丁》列为保留剧目，并组织了过去从来没有过的什么座谈会，大捧特捧，最后还把它拍成电影，流毒全国。这充分暴露了他们完全是有组织、有计划、有目的地进行反革命复辟活动，把社会主义的舞台变成了他们向党放暗箭、打黑枪的反动堡垒。
