The 11th National Conference on the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis, held recently in Chengdu, decided to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, and achieve the revolutionization of the schistosomiasis prevention and control teams and work. The conference required all localities to conscientiously implement the Party's mass line, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, launch a campaign of learning from each other and helping each other to catch up and surpass, and closely combine schistosomiasis prevention and control work with the socialist education movement, agricultural water conservancy construction, and rural health construction, to genuinely launch a new high tide in the prevention and control of schistosomiasis.

The conference pointed out that over the past year, with the rise of a new high tide in the study of Chairman Mao's works across the country, and with the victorious development of China's socialist revolution and socialist construction, schistosomiasis prevention and control work has also presented a new situation. In the treatment of the disease, the elimination of snails, and other prevention and control work, significant achievements have been made. To ensure that schistosomiasis prevention and control work keeps up with the new situation of the current socialist revolution and socialist construction, the conference required relevant regions to seriously summarize experiences, raise awareness, and accelerate the pace of schistosomiasis prevention and control work to strive for the early eradication of schistosomiasis.

Participants at the conference unanimously agreed that the experience of the past decade has fully proven that whenever and wherever the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is held high, politics is emphasized, and the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are conscientiously implemented, the work progresses rapidly and achieves great results; conversely, the work stagnates or even regresses. The conference pointed out that to do a good job in schistosomiasis prevention and control, the most fundamental thing is to take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, and to promote the revolutionization of the schistosomiasis prevention and control teams and work. Leading cadres at all levels must first seriously understand and implement Chairman Mao's strategic thinking of placing the focus of health work in rural areas to serve the five hundred million peasants, and the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on schistosomiasis prevention and control, to correctly guide the development of schistosomiasis prevention and control work. It is necessary to thoroughly transform the worldview of schistosomiasis prevention and control personnel, to further establish class views, mass views, and production views among cadres and technical personnel. It is necessary to help scientific and technical personnel correctly understand that politics leads business, which leads technology, to continue to organize them to go to the mountains and countryside, and to wholeheartedly serve the people in the epidemic areas.

The conference believed that class views, mass views, and production views are unified and inseparable, but they are not on the same level. The "three great views" must be guided by class views. The main victims of schistosomiasis are poor and lower-middle peasants. Currently, schistosomiasis still threatens the health and lives of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants in vast epidemic areas. Poor and lower-middle peasants are the reliance for carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction in rural areas in China, developing collective production, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, the prevention and control of schistosomiasis is not only a matter of preventing and controlling diseases but also a matter of how to treat the poor and lower-middle peasants, this revolutionary reliance. Every leading cadre and schistosomiasis prevention and control personnel in the epidemic areas should deeply understand the importance of this work, to carry out the work with deep class feelings and a strong sense of revolutionary responsibility, to eliminate and eradicate diseases for class brothers, and to resolutely carry out the prevention and control work to the end.

The conference also pointed out that schistosomiasis prevention and control work must resolutely implement the Party's mass line, insist on the combination of leadership, masses, and technical personnel, and take the road of self-reliance. Schistosomiasis prevention and control work is closely related to the production and life of the masses. The eradication of schistosomiasis is a mass revolutionary movement led by the Party. It is necessary to fully rely on the masses and mobilize the masses, to resolutely take the road of Dazhai self-reliance, and to make schistosomiasis prevention and control work a conscious action of the masses.

The conference also required all localities to conscientiously implement the policy of active prevention and control and comprehensive measures. At the same time, it is necessary to focus on the grassroots level, set up models, and launch a campaign of learning from each other and helping each other to catch up and surpass.

At this conference, everyone also discussed the long-term plan for national schistosomiasis prevention and control work and this year's battle deployment, determined to do a solid job in this year's prevention and control work, and to lay a solid foundation for the implementation of the long-term plan. This conference was convened by the CPC Central Committee's nine-person group for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis.

    乘胜追击　猛逐瘟神
    第十一次全国防治血吸虫病会议强调突出政治，实现血防队伍、血防工作革命化，为阶级兄弟除害灭病
    据新华社成都三日电  不久前在成都召开的第十一次全国防治血吸虫病工作会议，决定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，实现血防队伍、血防工作革命化。会议要求各地认真贯彻执行党的群众路线，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，开展比学赶帮超运动，把血防工作同社会主义教育运动、农田水利建设、农村卫生建设密切结合起来，踏踏实实地掀起一个防治血吸虫病的新高潮。
    会议指出，去年以来，随着全国广大干部群众学习毛主席著作新高潮的兴起，随着我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的胜利发展，防治血吸虫病工作也出现了新的局面，在治病、灭螺以及其他各项防治工作上，都取得了较好的成绩。为了使血防工作能够紧紧跟上当前社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新形势，会议要求有关地区认真总结经验，提高认识，加快血防工作的步伐，以争取尽快地消灭血吸虫病。
    参加会议的同志一致认为，十年来的经验充分证明，哪些时候，哪些地方，高举了毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出了政治，认真贯彻执行了党中央和毛主席的指示，工作的进展就快，成绩就大；反之，工作就迟迟不前，甚至倒退。会议指出，要做好血防工作，最根本的就是要把毛泽东思想当作指导方针，活学活用毛泽东思想，促进血防队伍和血防工作的革命化。各级领导干部首先要认真领会并贯彻执行毛主席的把卫生工作重点放到农村，为五亿农民服务的战略思想，和党中央、毛主席对血防工作的指示，正确地引导血防工作向前发展。要很好地改造血防人员的世界观，促使干部和技术人员进一步确立阶级观点、群众观点、生产观点。要帮助科学技术人员正确认识政治统帅业务统帅技术，继续组织他们上山下乡，全心全意为疫区人民服务。
    会议认为阶级观点、群众观点、生产观点是统一的，不可分割的，但并不是平列的。“三大观点”必须以阶级观点为纲。血吸虫病的主要受害者是贫下中农。目前，血吸虫病仍然威胁着广大疫区千百万贫下中农的健康和生命。贫下中农，是我国在农村中进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，发展集体生产，巩固无产阶级专政的依靠力量。因此，防治血吸虫病，不仅是一个防治疾病的问题，而且是一个如何对待贫下中农这个革命的依靠力量问题。疫区的每个领导干部和血防人员，都应该深刻地认识到这个工作的重要意义，要带着深厚的阶级感情和强烈的革命责任心为阶级弟兄除害灭病，坚决将防治工作进行到底。
    会议还指出，血防工作必须坚决贯彻执行党的群众路线，坚持实行领导、群众和技术人员三结合，走自力更生的道路。血防工作和群众的生产、生活密切相关，消灭血吸虫病是党领导的一个群众革命运动。必须充分依靠群众和发动群众，坚决走大寨自力更生的道路，使血防工作成为群众自觉行动。
    会议还要求各地认真贯彻执行积极防治的方针和综合措施。同时要抓基层、树样板，开展比学赶帮超运动。
    这次会议上，大家还讨论了全国防治血吸虫病工作的长远规划，以及今年的战斗部署，决心扎扎实实做好今年的防治工作，为实现长远规划打下坚实基础。这次会议是中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组召开的。
