The great leader Chairman Mao has come among us, and the square is filled with waves of joyous excitement. Five hundred thousand people enthusiastically shout: Long live Chairman Mao, our most beloved leader, forever! We are Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country, here to listen to the commands of our supreme commander. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, dedicate our hearts to the revolution, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to pioneer, and dare to make revolution, and become good successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. We will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and march forward bravely!
