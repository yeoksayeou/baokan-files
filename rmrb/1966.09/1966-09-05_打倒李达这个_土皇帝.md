    Overthrow Li Da, This "Local Tyrant"
    Hunan Province Lingling County Cai Jia Commune
    Oil Pressing Head Brigade Old Poor Peasant  Tang Shunba

    Before liberation, I was always a hired worker for the landlord Li Da and was often beaten and scolded by him. I suffered the most under Li Da's oppression. Li Da made me cultivate more than twenty mu of land for him, and also made me carry his sedan chair, tend his orchard, fetch water to brew alcohol, and empty his chamber pots. I was an old bachelor, and until liberation, I had been working for Li Da without receiving a single cent or grain of rice from him.

    What was even more despicable was that my family had only five mu of land next to Li Da's house. Li Da had his eyes on this piece of land. After working for him, carrying his sedan chair the whole year, when we settled accounts at the end of the year, it turned out that I owed him five dou of grain. My family's only five mu of land was thus extorted by him, leaving my family with no roof over our heads and no land to till.

    We long-term laborers worked our fingers to the bone for this landlord, but the food we ate was not even fit for pigs and dogs. He and his wife and son ate well every meal, while we had to eat leftovers.

    Li Da never worked, and whenever he went out, he always took a sedan chair, even for a distance of one or two li. What did he use the sedan chair for? He used it to fight lawsuits for landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, speaking on their behalf and causing many poor people to be imprisoned, selling their land and houses. Li Da's sedan chair was a "dragon and tiger sedan," long, large, and heavy. Once, while carrying Li Da, I fell about half a li from home. It was raining heavily, the road was slippery, and I hadn't eaten, my stomach was empty, I was sick, and I had no strength left. I fell to the ground. Li Da got out of the sedan chair and beat me with a stick. After beating me, he still made me carry him back home, treating me like I was not even human.

    Now that we have been liberated, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have led us to stand up. Li Da wants to reverse the situation, and we must definitely overthrow him.

    打倒李达这个“土皇帝”
    湖南零陵县蔡家公社
    油榨头大队老贫农  唐顺八
    解放前我一直给地主分子李达当雇工，经常挨他打骂。我受李达的压迫最深。李达要我给他种二十多亩田地，还要我给他抬轿、种果园、挑水酿酒、倒屎倒尿，什么事情都要我做。我是个老光棍，到解放为止，一直在给李达帮工，没有得到他一分钱、一粒米。
    更可恨的是，我家仅有五分地，在李达的屋旁边，李达看中了这块地。我给他帮工、抬轿到年底，一算账，倒欠他五斗谷，我家仅有的五分地就这样被他勒索去了，害得我家上无片瓦，下无寸地。
    我们长工给这个地主分子做事，累死累活，但是我们吃的连猪狗都不如。他和他的老婆、儿子每餐都吃好的，我们吃的都是些残菜剩饭。
    李达从不劳动，出门总坐轿，就是一里、二里路他也不走。他坐轿子做什么事呢？是为地主、富农、反革命分子打官司，帮他们说话，害得一些穷人坐牢，卖田卖地。李达坐的是“龙虎轿”，又长又大又重。有一次我抬李达这个猪，抬到离家还有半里路远的地方，天下大雨，路上很滑，在那里又没吃饭，肚子饿，又有病，没有一点力气，跌了一跤。李达走下轿子，用棍子毒打了我一顿，打了后还要我抬他回去，根本不把我当人。
    解放了，共产党、毛主席领导我们翻了身，现在李达要变天，我们一定要把他打倒。
