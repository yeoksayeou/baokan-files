Shandong's various regions are intensifying their preparations for autumn sowing under the premise of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking. Partial regions have already begun autumn sowing activities.

Based on the summary of last autumn's sowing experience, various regions have organized cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's works extensively, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and striving to complete autumn sowing preparations at a high standard. Due to the extraordinarily high revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad cadres and community members, the autumn sowing preparations are proceeding quickly and well.

    山东秋种准备力争高标准
    据新华社济南十二日电　山东各地在活学活用毛主席著作，大抓人的思想革命化的前提下，加紧进行秋种准备。局部地区的秋种活动已经开始。
    各地在总结去年秋种经验的基础上，组织干部和群众大学毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化，力争高标准完成秋种准备。由于广大干部和社员革命热情异常高涨，秋种准备工作又快又好。同去年相比，许多地区土、肥、水、种等条件都显著地改善。济宁地区的大批肥料已经运到田头，即将开展播种工作。昌潍地区已灭茬一百多万亩，翻地五十多万亩，播种工作已经部分开始。
