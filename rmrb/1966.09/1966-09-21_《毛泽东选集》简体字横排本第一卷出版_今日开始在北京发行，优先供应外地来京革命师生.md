The first volume of the simplified Chinese horizontal print edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" will begin distribution in Beijing starting September 21.

The new edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was published under the warm care of the Party Central Committee and through the hard work of the revolutionary workers in the capital's printing sector in a short period of time. Due to the urgent need of revolutionary students and teachers from outside the capital who have come to the capital and to the side of our great leader Chairman Mao for "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," the first volume of the new edition will be prioritized for distribution to these revolutionary students and teachers from outside the capital.
