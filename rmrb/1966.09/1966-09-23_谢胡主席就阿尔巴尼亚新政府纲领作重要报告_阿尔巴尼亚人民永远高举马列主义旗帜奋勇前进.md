Albanian People Forever Hold High the Banner of Marxism-Leninism and March Forward Bravely

Block the Channels for the Production of Revisionism and the Restoration of Capitalism and Resolutely Fight to the End Against U.S. Imperialism and Soviet Revisionism

NEW YORK, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Premier Mehmet Shehu delivered an important report on the program of the new government at the first session of the sixth people's assembly on September 13.

In his report, Shehu pointed out that the fifth people's assembly and the third five-year plan period marked a new upsurge in the economy, culture, and living standards of the people, the strengthening of the country's defense forces, and the enhancement of Albania's position on the international stage.

Defeating the Surrounding and Blockade by the Khrushchev Revisionists and Advancing Along the Path of Socialism and Communism

Shehu said that during the fifth assembly, we waged a life-and-death struggle against the Khrushchev revisionists while continuing to fight against U.S. imperialism on all fronts—ideological, political, and economic. In this unprecedented struggle, our party and people have shown more than ever before our great revolutionary spirit: revolutionary principles, revolutionary unity, and revolutionary courage. Our party and people, united as firmly as a rock around the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, with one hand holding the hoe and the other the gun, have unshakable confidence in our strength, are filled with love for our friends and hatred for our enemies, firmly believe in the victory of Marxism-Leninism and the defeat of imperialism and revisionism, and bravely advance, foiling conspiracies, smashing the blockade, and overcoming all difficulties to achieve victory after victory.

Shehu stressed that in the past year, due to the implementation of the party's revolutionary measures, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working masses has increased, they have shown initiative, cadres have become more closely connected with the masses, government institutions have served the people better and are under better supervision by the people, and both the economic revolution and the ideological and cultural revolution have been given new impetus. The main purpose of these revolutionary measures is to block all channels for the production of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country. This is an important stage in our continuous revolution.

When Shehu spoke about Albania's successful implementation of the third five-year plan, he said that Khrushchev and his lackeys imposed an economic blockade on our country in an attempt to make our third five-year plan fail. Our struggle against them was extremely arduous and complex. They tried to starve us, to subdue us, to bury us, and they used any means to achieve their anti-Albania and anti-Marxism goals. The result? The result is that the People's Republic of Albania overcame all obstacles, smashed the blockade, foiled all conspiracies, and implemented the third five-year plan. It did not bow to either the imperialists or the revisionists, it won, and it steadily advanced along the chosen path, the path of socialism and communism.

Implementing the Party's Marxist-Leninist Revolutionary Line and Completing New Tasks United Around the Party and Government

After introducing the composition of the new government, Shehu said that the program of the new government, like that of the previous government, is to fully implement the party's Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line in both domestic and foreign policies.

Shehu said that in domestic policy, the government's program is first and foremost to complete the political and economic tasks outlined in the draft directives of the upcoming fifth congress of the Party of Labor of Albania. The main tasks are: further developing the country's productive forces, accelerating the construction of the material and technological foundations of socialism by increasing industrial production and significantly promoting agricultural production. In this way, the material well-being and cultural level of the people will be further improved, and the country's defensive capabilities will be further strengthened. These fundamental tasks are also to further develop socialist production relations, deepen the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural spheres, strengthen the people's power, and make the people more closely united with the party and government in spirit and politics on the basis of class struggle. Throughout the entire historical period of socialist construction, class struggle has always been the driving force of our society.

In foreign policy, the government's program aims to ensure that the country's independence and sovereignty are not threatened by any possible external dangers, to further strengthen Albania's international position, to further strengthen friendship, sincere cooperation, and mutual aid with the brotherly peoples of socialist countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, to unconditionally support the national liberation revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples, and to develop relations and cooperation with all countries of different social systems on the basis of the principles of equality of rights, non-interference in internal affairs, mutual respect, and mutual benefit, to maintain and consolidate true peace.

Shehu said that the tasks in the domestic policy will be completed through the work and struggle of the people and government institutions under the leadership of the party, through revolutionary efforts based on self-reliance for the development of socialist production, through the promotion of advanced experience, relying on the creative abilities of the working masses, and through class struggle against class enemies, against all hostile activities, against capitalist remnants in the people's minds, and against the influence and pressure of bourgeois ideology.

The tasks in foreign policy will be completed through uncompromising and thorough struggle on the two fronts against U.S.-led imperialism and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Khrushchev leadership.

Faster Economic Development in the New Five-Year Plan Period, Strengthening National Defense Forces and Proletarian Dictatorship Institutions

When Shehu spoke about the draft directives of the party's fifth congress on the fourth five-year plan, he said that according to the main indicators of the fourth five-year plan, the country's economy will develop at a faster pace during the 1966-1970 five-year plan period than during the 1961-1965 third five-year plan period.

During the fourth five-year plan period, total industrial output will increase by approximately 51 percent, and total agricultural output will increase by 35 to 40 percent over the third five-year plan period. By 1970, total agricultural output will have increased by 70 percent compared to 1965. Improving agricultural production is the most important and primary task of the fourth five-year plan.

Shehu said that the tasks of the fourth five-year plan are enormous and arduous, but they are completely achievable. The guarantee for achieving this task is the party's correct line, the strong and loyal leadership of the Central Committee led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the patriotism and revolutionary strength of the Albanian people, the socialist economic foundation we have already established, and the economic potential of our country. At the same time, to achieve the goals set by the fourth five-year plan, we will, as in the past, receive internationalist aid from the People's Republic of China. The Albanian people, our party, and our government will never forget the brotherly aid of the People's Republic of China, and we will forever be grateful for the brotherly and internationalist aid provided by the Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong, and the government of the People's Republic of China.

He also pointed out that according to the party's directives, the government will pay special attention to further strengthening the country's defense forces, making our armed forces and armed people ready for battle so that they can deal with any foreign aggression at any time. We will strive to strengthen the state security institutions as organs of the proletarian dictatorship so that they can, under the leadership of the party and relying on the masses, smash any attempts by class enemies to oppose the people's power.

Contradictions in the International Situation Are Sharpening, Revolutionary Forces Decide the Course of World History

When Shehu spoke about the international situation, he said that the main contradictions of the day—the contradictions between socialism and capitalism, between oppressed peoples and imperialism, between labor and capital, between imperialist countries, and between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism—are becoming increasingly sharp and deep. U.S. imperialism is becoming more ferocious and aggressive. Khrushchev revisionism is becoming more dangerous and cunning, the peoples of various countries are becoming more vigilant and resolute, and the ranks of the international communist movement are further splitting. However, the forces that decide the course of history are not imperialism and revisionism, but the forces of socialism, revolution, and social progress.

He said that the developments of the past four or five years have already drawn a clear line between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. The modern revisionists centered on the Soviet Khrushchev leadership have already stood on the same line as U.S.-led imperialism, opposing socialism, oppressed peoples, the international working class, and peace.

Shehu pointed out that today, Vietnam has forever buried the myth of the invincibility of U.S. military force, and it has become a source of inspiration for the peoples of various countries to struggle for freedom and independence. Vietnam has become a touchstone for identifying who are the true friends and true enemies of the Vietnamese people, socialism, the freedom of the peoples of various countries, and peace.

Shehu said that the U.S. aggression against Vietnam has buried the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnam issue. Under these circumstances, it is completely legal for the Vietnamese people to no longer be bound by these agreements, and it is completely legal for the Vietnamese people to take all measures to defend their country and eliminate the aggressors based on specific circumstances.

Shehu emphasized that the declaration of the People's Republic of China to prepare to provide unlimited aid to the brotherly Vietnamese people and to deal with any allies that might attack China is not an empty statement, but reflects the great reality of our times, showing that the People's Republic of China has today become an invincible socialist fortress, and that no force in the world can conquer this fortress. This is a great victory for socialism and the peoples of various countries.

Shehu said that while the U.S. imperialists are escalating their criminal war in Vietnam, they are also, as everyone knows, launching a large-scale diplomatic deception campaign on "peace talks," attempting to obtain through negotiations what they cannot obtain on the battlefield.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has helped the U.S. imperialists in this regard, turning Moscow into a reactionary center where they have plotted and schemed vicious conspiracies against the Vietnamese people. The Khrushchev revisionists' movement to achieve "unity" and "joint action" of socialist countries is a trap set to deceive the peoples of various countries and make socialist countries accomplices in the Khrushchev group's criminal acts of sabotaging the Vietnamese people's just struggle. The "unity" and "joint action" of socialist countries advocated by the Khrushchev faction is unity with U.S. imperialism, opposition to the Vietnamese people, and opposition to the peoples of socialist countries.

Shehu reiterated that the Albanian government fully supports the position of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam as expressed in their four-point proposal and five-point declaration, as well as the "Call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh" issued on July 17 of this year.

The Further the Soviet Revisionists Go Down the Road of Surrender to U.S. Imperialism, the More Their True Colors Are Exposed and the Closer Their Doom Approaches

When Shehu spoke about the counter-revolutionary global strategy of U.S. imperialism, he pointed out that the main target of U.S. imperialism's global strategy is the People's Republic of China. All the aggressive actions and military preparations that the U.S. has taken in Southeast Asia and the Far East are ultimately aimed at preparing for an armed attack on China.

In their frenzied anti-China activities, U.S. imperialists have received open support from Khrushchev revisionists. Today, imperialism and revisionism have in fact established a "holy alliance" against the people's China.

Shehu said that no matter what conspiracies and tricks the U.S. imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists plot, no matter what "firepower encirclement" they build around the socialist fortress of China, they will suffer a shameful defeat. The great people's China is no longer the semi-feudal and semi-colonial China of the past. It has become invincible and can deal with any foreign invasion alliance.

When Shehu spoke about the issue of peace and security in Europe, he pointed out that the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism and the surrender policies of modern revisionists pose a serious danger to the peoples of European countries.

When Shehu exposed the conspiracy of modern revisionists to create a peaceful situation in Europe, he pointed out that this is to ensure that the U.S. has no worries in Europe and can freely transfer its military forces from Europe to Vietnam to suppress the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and to prepare for an aggressive war against the People's Republic of China and other peaceful countries.

Shehu emphasized that the government of the People's Republic of Albania has always advocated and will continue to advocate ensuring and consolidating the security and peace of Europe, but it will never separate ensuring the security of Europe from ensuring true international security and true peace in the world.

Shehu cited a large number of facts to expose the political line pursued by the Soviet revisionist leadership, which is a line of strengthening cooperation with U.S. imperialism to dominate the world. He said that the further revisionism goes down the road of cooperation and surrender to U.S. imperialism, the more it exposes its true colors, the more it increases the hatred of the people it rules, and the closer it approaches its inevitable doom. The struggle of the peoples of various countries has wounded the aging imperialism, and due to its internal rot, it is already in a state of terminal illness. Internal contradictions are disintegrating the alliance, leading it to the grave, and it is struggling like a wounded beast, biting here and there, but nothing can save it from death. The fate of the offspring of this beast, revisionism, is the same: awaiting it is failure and the grave, and ultimate victory will belong to socialism and the peoples of various countries.

The Brotherly Friendship Between the Chinese and Albanian Peoples Is Developing, the Relationship Between the Two Countries Embodies the Principles of Internationalism

Shehu said that the brotherly relationship between Albania and the People's Republic of China is developing and strengthening on the basis of proletarian internationalism and the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples and two Marxist-Leninist parties. He said that especially this year, the mutual visits of the delegations of the two parties and governments have made great contributions in this regard. The Albania-China Joint Statement signed in Beijing on May 11 is a model that truly reflects the unbreakable friendship and unity between our two peoples, our two parties, and our two governments, and is a document of internationalist Marxism-Leninism.

The fair and equal relationship between our two countries, the multi-faceted development of mutual aid and internationalist cooperation, have set an example of how socialist countries—regardless of the size of their territory, economic strength, and population—should establish relations.

Our people and government will, as always, fully support the correct and peaceful foreign policy of the People's Republic of China, support its resolute struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and modern revisionism, support China's indisputable right to liberate Taiwan and the offshore islands, and restore its legitimate rights in the United Nations and other international organizations; and expel the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from these organizations.

Shehu said that we will continue to develop friendly cooperation and brotherly aid relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In the world-renowned struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people against U.S. aggressors, we will support them to the end and provide them with all the assistance we can.

When Shehu spoke about the issue of the United Nations, he pointed out that U.S. imperialism and modern revisionists, in order to achieve U.S.-Soviet cooperation, have turned the United Nations into a center for political transactions that harm the peoples of various countries and for the two superpowers to dominate the world. In fact, the United Nations does not act according to the wishes of the peoples of various countries and does not serve the wishes of the peoples of various countries. The government of the People's Republic of Albania believes that the United Nations must get out of the dangerous situation it is deeply mired in, it must forever get rid of all control by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, correct its serious mistakes, and undergo a thorough reorganization, it must become a world organization that truly serves the peoples of various countries and peace. Otherwise, it will end up in a shameful collapse like the League of Nations.

Shehu concluded his report by saying that we look optimistically to the future, we firmly believe in our own strength and the correctness of our party's line. Our people and party, like one person, will unite around the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and forever march forward. We will overcome any difficulties, we will smash any enemies, we will achieve all our lofty goals of building socialism, and we will forever hold high the sacred banner of Marxism-Leninism.

    谢胡主席就阿尔巴尼亚新政府纲领作重要报告
    阿尔巴尼亚人民永远高举马列主义旗帜奋勇前进
    堵塞产生修正主义和资本主义复辟的渠道　坚决同美帝苏修斗争到底
    新华社地拉那二十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席穆罕默德·谢胡十三日在阿尔巴尼亚第六届议会第一次会议上就新政府的纲领作了重要报告。
    谢胡在报告中指出，阿尔巴尼亚第五届人民议会和第三个五年计划时期标志着经济、文化和人民生活水平的新高涨，标志着国家防御力量的加强和我国在国际舞台上的地位的加强。
    粉碎赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的包围封锁  沿着社会主义和共产主义的道路前进
    谢胡说，在第五届议会时期，我们同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者进行了殊死斗争，同时继续在各条战线上——思想战线、政治战线和经济战线——同美帝国主义进行了针锋相对的斗争。在这场史无前例的斗争中，比以往任何时候更加表现出我们党和我国人民的伟大革命气节：革命的原则性、革命的团结和革命的勇气。在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会周围团结得坚如磐石的我们党和我国人民，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，对自己的力量有着毫不动摇的信心，内心充满了对朋友的爱和对敌人的恨，深信马克思列宁主义的胜利和帝国主义、修正主义的失败，奋勇前进，挫败阴谋，粉碎封锁和克服重重困难，节节胜利。
    谢胡强调指出，在过去一年中，由于执行了党的革命措施，劳动群众的革命干劲提高了，他们表现出了意气风发的主动性，干部更加联系群众了，政权机构更加为群众服务了，并受到群众的更好的监督，不论是对经济革命还是对思想和文化革命都给予了新的推动。这些革命措施的主要目的，就是要堵塞在我国产生修正主义和资本主义在我国复辟的一切渠道。这是我们不断革命中的一个重要阶段。
    谢胡在谈到阿尔巴尼亚胜利地实现了第三个五年计划时说，赫鲁晓夫及其仆从对我国实行经济封锁，企图使我们的第三个五年计划遭到失败。我们同他们进行的斗争是十分艰巨、十分复杂的。他们想把我们饿死，他们想使我们屈服，他们想埋葬我们，他们为达到他们的反对阿尔巴尼亚和反对马克思主义的目的是不择手段的。结果怎么样？结果是，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国克服了一切障碍，粉碎了包围，粉碎了封锁，挫败了一切阴谋，并且实现了第三个五年计划，它既没有向帝国主义者也没有向修正主义者低头，它胜利了，并沿着选定的道路、沿着社会主义和共产主义的道路稳步前进。
    贯彻执行党的马列主义革命路线  团结在党和政府周围完成新任务
    谢胡介绍了新政府的组成后说，新政府的纲领像上届政府的一样，就是要在对内政策和对外政策方面完全贯彻执行我们党的马克思列宁主义革命路线。
    谢胡说，在对内政策方面，政府的纲领首先是要完成即将举行的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的第五次代表大会的指示草案中规定的各项政治和经济任务。这些主要任务是：进一步发展国家的生产力，加速建设社会主义的物质和技术基础，办法是提高工业生产量，显著地促进农业生产。这样，人民的物质福利和文化水平将进一步得到提高，祖国的防御力量将进一步得到加强。这些根本任务也就是要进一步发展社会主义的生产关系，深入进行意识形态和文化方面的社会主义革命，加强人民政权，使人民在阶级斗争的基础上，在精神上和政治上更加紧密地团结在党和政府的周围。在社会主义建设的整个历史时期，阶级斗争始终是我们社会的推动力。
    在对外政策方面，政府纲领要确保国家的独立和主权不遭受任何可能的外来危险，进一步加强我国的国际地位，在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上进一步加强同社会主义国家兄弟人民的友谊、真诚合作和互助，毫无保留地支持各被压迫人民的民族解放革命斗争，在权利平等、互不干涉内政、相互尊重和互利的原则基础上同所有不同社会制度的国家发展关系和合作，维护和巩固真正的和平。
    谢胡说，对内政策方面的各项任务，要通过党领导下的人民和政权机构的工作和斗争，要通过以自力更生为基础的为发展社会主义生产所作出的革命努力，要通过推广先进经验，依靠劳动群众的创造性的才能，通过对阶级敌人、对一切敌视活动、对人民思想中的资本主义残余、对资产阶级意识形态的影响和压力进行的阶级斗争来完成。
    对外政策方面的各项任务，将通过反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团为中心的现代修正主义这两条战线上不妥协的和彻底的斗争来完成。
    在新的五年计划期间经济发展速度更快  加强国家防御力量和无产阶级专政机构
    谢胡谈到党的第五次代表大会关于第四个五年计划的指示草案时说，根据第四个五年计划指示草案的主要指标，在一九六六——一九七○年的五年计划期间，我国经济将以比一九六一——一九六五年第三个五年计划期间更快的速度发展。
    在第四个五年计划期间，工业总产量将增加约百分之五十一，农业总产量在这五年中将比第三个五年计划期间的农业总产量增长百分之三十五至百分之四十。在一九七○年，农业总产量同一九六五年相比将增加百分之七十。提高农业生产是第四个五年计划的最主要和最重要的任务。
    谢胡说，第四个五年计划的任务是巨大而艰巨的，但是，是完全可以实现的。实现这个任务的保证是党的正确路线，党的坚强和忠实的领导——以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的中央委员会，我国人民的爱国主义和革命力量，我们已经建立的社会主义经济基础和我国的经济潜力。同时，为了实现第四个五年计划所确定的目标，我们将像过去一样，得到中华人民共和国的国际主义的援助。我国人民，我们的党和我国政府将永远不会忘记中华人民共和国兄弟般的援助，并且将永远感激兄弟的中国人民、以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府所提供的这种兄弟般的和国际主义的援助。
    他还指出，根据党的指示，政府将特别注意进一步加强国家的防御力量，使我们武装部队和武装起来的人民群众战斗化，以便使他们能够随时对付外来的任何侵略。我们将努力加强作为无产阶级专政机关的国家保安机构，以便使它们战斗化，使它们能在党的领导下和在依靠人民群众的基础上粉碎阶级敌人反对人民政权的任何企图。
    国际局势中各种矛盾日益尖锐化  决定世界历史潮流的是革命力量
    谢胡在谈到国际局势时说，当代的主要矛盾——社会主义同资本主义、被压迫人民同帝国主义、劳动同资本、帝国主义国家之间、马克思列宁主义同修正主义之间的矛盾——正在日益尖锐化和深化。美帝国主义日益变得更加凶残和更富于侵略性。赫鲁晓夫修正主义变得更危险和更狡猾，各国人民更加警惕了和更为坚决了，国际共产主义运动队伍正在进一步分化。但是，决定历史潮流的，不是帝国主义和修正主义，而是社会主义、革命和社会进步的力量。
    他说，最近四、五年来的事态发展，已经在马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间划清了一条明确的界线。以苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者，已经同以美国为首的帝国主义站在同一条战线上，反对社会主义，反对被压迫人民，反对国际工人阶级，反对和平。
    谢胡指出，今天越南永远埋葬了美国军事力量“不可战胜”的神话，它已经成为鼓舞各国人民为争取自由和独立而斗争的源泉。越南已经成为识别谁是越南人民、社会主义、各国人民的自由和和平的真正朋友和真正敌人的试金石。
    谢胡说，美国对越南的侵略已经埋葬了一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议。在这种情况下，越南人民不再受这些协议的约束是完全合法的，越南人民根据具体情况有权采取保卫国家，消灭侵略者的一切措施，这也是完全合法的。
    谢胡强调指出，中华人民共和国关于准备给予兄弟的越南人民以无限度的援助以及对付可能进攻中国的侵略者的任何同盟的声明不是空话，而是体现了我们时代的伟大现实，表明中华人民共和国今天已经成为不可战胜的社会主义堡垒，世界上没有任何力量能攻克这个堡垒。这是社会主义和各国人民的一个伟大胜利。
    谢胡说，美帝国主义者在越南加紧他们的罪恶战争“升级”的同时，还像大家所知道的那样，发动了关于“和平谈判”的大规模的外交骗局，妄图通过谈判得到他们在战场上得不到的东西。
    苏联修正主义领导集团在这方面给美帝国主义者帮了大忙，他们把莫斯科变成一个反动中心，在那里密谋策划了反对越南人民的恶毒阴谋。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者争取社会主义国家“团结”和“联合行动”的运动，是为了欺骗各国人民和使社会主义国家成为赫鲁晓夫集团破坏越南人民正义斗争的罪恶勾当的同谋者而设下的圈套。赫鲁晓夫分子所叫嚷的社会主义国家“团结起来采取联合行动”，是同美帝国主义的团结，是反对越南人民、反对社会主义各国人民的。
    谢胡重申阿尔巴尼亚政府完全支持越南民主共和国政府和越南南方民族解放阵线在他们的四项主张和五点声明中所表明的立场，以及今年七月十七日发表的《胡志明主席号召书》。
    苏修在向美帝投降的道路上走得越远  它的面目就越加暴露末日就越加临近
    谢胡在谈到美帝国主义反革命的全球战略时指出，美帝国主义的全球战略的矛头，主要是指向中华人民共和国的，美国在东南亚和远东采取的一切侵略行动和进行的军事准备，其最终目的是准备对中国发动武装进攻。
    在疯狂的反华活动中，美帝国主义得到赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的公开支持。今天，帝国主义和修正主义已经在事实上建立了反对人民中国的“神圣同盟”。
    谢胡说，但是不管美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者策划什么阴谋诡计，不管他们在社会主义的堡垒中国周围建立什么“火力包围圈”，他们必将遭到可耻的失败。伟大的人民中国已不再是过去半封建和半殖民地的中国。它已成为不可战胜的，它能对付外来的任何侵略同盟。
    谢胡在谈到欧洲的和平与安全问题时指出，美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策以及现代修正主义者的投降政策，对欧洲各国人民来说，是一个严重的危险。
    谢胡揭露现代修正主义者企图在欧洲创造一种平静局面的阴谋时指出，这是使美国在欧洲无后顾之忧，可以放手把自己的军事力量从欧洲转移到越南去压制越南人民的英勇斗争，加紧准备一场对中华人民共和国和其它和平国家的侵略战争。
    谢胡强调说，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府过去和现在一贯主张要保证和巩固欧洲的安全与和平，但是它过去和现在都决不会把保证欧洲的安全同保证真正的国际安全和全世界的真正和平分割开来。
    谢胡列举大量事实揭露苏联修正主义领导所推行的政治路线，是同美帝国主义加强合作主宰世界的路线。他说，修正主义在同美帝国主义合作和向它投降的道路上走得愈远，就愈加暴露自己的面目，就愈加增强了受他们统治的人民对他们的仇恨，就愈加接近他们不可避免的末日。各国人民的斗争把衰老的帝国主义打得遍体鳞伤，由于它内部的腐烂已病入膏肓，内部的重重矛盾瓦解着联盟，把它引向坟墓，它正像受伤的野兽一样作垂死的挣扎，东咬一口，西咬一口，但是什么也挽救不了它的死亡。这只野兽的产儿修正主义的命运也是这样：等待着它的是失败和坟墓，最后胜利将属于社会主义和各国人民。
    中阿人民的兄弟友谊日益发展  两国关系体现了国际主义原则
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚同中华人民共和国的兄弟般的关系，在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上，在我们两国人民和两个马克思列宁主义政党之间的牢不可破的友谊基础上，正在日益发展和加强。他说，特别是今年，我们两党和两国政府的代表团的相互访问，在这方面作出了巨大的贡献。今年五月十一日在北京签署的阿中联合声明堪称典范地反映了我们两国人民，我们两党和我们两国政府之间的牢不可破的友谊和团结，是一项具有国际主义的马克思列宁主义文献。
    我们两国之间的公正和平等的关系、互助和国际主义合作的多方面发展，为社会主义国家——不管它们的领土、经济力量的大小和人口多少——之间应当建立怎样的关系作出了榜样。
    我国人民和我国政府将一如既往，完全支持中华人民共和国的正确与和平的对外政策，支持它反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和现代修正主义的坚决斗争，支持中国解放台湾和沿海岛屿的不容置疑的权利，恢复中国在联合国组织和其他国际组织中的合法权利；并且把蒋介石匪帮从这些组织中赶出去。
    谢胡说，我们将继续发展同越南民主共和国的友好合作和兄弟般的援助关系。在英雄的越南人民抗击美国侵略者的举世称赞的斗争中，我们将支持他们到底，并且向他们提供我们力所能及的一切援助。
    谢胡在谈到联合国问题时指出，美帝国主义和现代修正主义者为了实现苏美合作，已经把联合国变成了损害各国人民、为两大国主宰世界进行政治交易的中心。事实上，联合国不根据各国人民的希望办事，不为各国人民的愿望服务。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府认为，联合国必须摆脱它所深深陷入的危险处境，它必须永远摆脱美苏的一切控制，纠正自己的严重错误，彻底进行改组，必须使自己成为世界性的组织，真正为各国人民和和平服务。否则，它将同过去的国际联盟的可耻垮台一样，落得个可耻的下场。
    谢胡在结束报告时说，我们乐观地展望着未来，我们坚信我们自己的力量和我们党的路线的正确性。我国人民和党，将像一个人一样，团结在恩维尔·霍查同志为首的党中央委员会的周围，永远前进，我们将克服任何困难，我们将粉碎任何敌人，我们将达到我们建设社会主义的所有崇高的目标，我们将永远高举神圣的马克思列宁主义的旗帜。
