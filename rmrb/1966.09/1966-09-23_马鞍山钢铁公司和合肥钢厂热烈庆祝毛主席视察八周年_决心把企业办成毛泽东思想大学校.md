Today marks the eighth anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company. On September 20, 40,000 workers from Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company and representatives from various sectors of Ma'anshan City held a grand meeting to celebrate this most glorious and happiest day in the history of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company. The meeting decided to designate September 20 as the permanent memorial day for Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, to be celebrated every year and passed down from generation to generation, so that the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought will forever illuminate the revolutionary path of the Ma'anshan people.

On September 20, 1958, Chairman Mao personally inspected Ma'anshan and gave extremely important instructions to the workers of Ma'anshan. Chairman Mao said, "Ma'anshan has good conditions and can be developed into a medium-sized iron and steel integrated enterprise because developing medium-sized iron and steel integrated enterprises is faster." After inspecting several iron and steel plants in Anhui Province, Chairman Mao instructed, "The development of the iron and steel industry must be carried out through mass movements. All work must be carried out through mass movements. Without mass movements, it is not possible." Over the past eight years, the workers of Ma'anshan have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, launched mass movements, adopted the policy of combining indigenous and modern methods, and worked hard and self-reliantly to transform a factory that could only produce pig iron into a modern medium-sized iron and steel integrated enterprise with mining, beneficiation, sintering, coking, iron smelting, steel smelting, and steel rolling.

Since 1964, Chairman Mao's call for industry to learn from Daqing, agriculture to learn from Dazhai, and the entire people to learn from the People's Liberation Army, as well as the emphasis on strengthening political and ideological work, has pointed the way forward for the people of Ma'anshan. All workers have quickly launched a campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, promoting the ideological transformation of the people, and turning Ma'anshan into an advanced enterprise in the style of Daqing.

At the September 20 celebration meeting, representatives of Ma'anshan workers spoke, unanimously expressing their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more diligently and to turn Ma'anshan into a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, September 22 - On September 18, the workers of Hefei Steel Plant held a grand meeting to celebrate the eighth anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of Hefei Steel Plant.

On September 18, 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected Hefei Steel Plant. This was the most brilliant and happiest day in the history of Hefei Steel Plant. At the meeting on September 18, all workers of Hefei Steel Plant unanimously expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and to turn Hefei Steel Plant into a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military.

Over the past eight years, all workers of the plant have never forgotten Chairman Mao's teachings and have advanced courageously along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. They have built this small steel plant into one with multiple steel furnaces, capable of steelmaking, rolling, and producing refractory materials. Now, this steel plant not only has an elevenfold increase in production compared to 1958 but also has significantly developed in steel varieties.

In recent years, the revolutionary workers of Hefei Steel Plant have launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoting the ideological transformation of the workers and the revolutionization of the enterprise. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers have taken the lead in revolution and promoted production. From January to August this year, compared to the same period last year, steel production increased by 13%, steel product production increased by 12%, steel product varieties increased by 36, specifications increased by 135, and product quality has significantly improved.

    马鞍山钢铁公司和合肥钢厂热烈庆祝毛主席视察八周年
    决心把企业办成毛泽东思想大学校
    据新华社合肥二十二日电　今年九月二十日，是我们伟大领袖毛主席视察马鞍山钢铁公司八周年。马钢职工和马鞍山市各界人民代表共四万人，二十日举行隆重集会，最热烈地庆祝马钢历史上这个最光荣、最幸福的日子。大会决定把九月二十日定为马鞍山钢铁公司永久的纪念日，年年庆祝，世世代代庆祝，让毛泽东思想的光辉永远照耀着马钢人在革命化的大道上奋勇前进。
    一九五八年九月二十日，毛主席亲临马钢视察，对马钢职工作了极其重要的指示。毛主席说，马鞍山条件很好，可以发展成为中型钢铁联合企业，因为发展中型的钢铁联合企业比较快。毛主席视察了安徽省几个钢铁厂以后，指示说：“发展钢铁工业一定要搞群众运动，什么工作都要搞群众运动，没有群众运动是不行的。”八年来，马钢职工遵照毛主席的教导，大搞群众运动，采取土洋并举、两条腿走路的方针，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，终于把一个原先只能炼铁的工厂发展成为一个拥有采矿、选矿、烧结、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢和轧钢的现代化中型钢铁联合企业。
    一九六四年以来，毛主席关于工业学大庆，农业学大寨，全国人民学解放军，加强政治思想工作的号召，给马钢人指出了进一步前进的方向。全体职工迅速掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，促进了人的思想革命化，把马钢办成了大庆式的先进企业。
    在九月二十日的庆祝大会上，马钢的职工代表在会上讲话，一致表示要更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，把马钢办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    据新华社合肥二十二日电　安徽合肥钢厂职工十八日隆重集会，热烈庆祝毛主席视察合肥钢厂八周年。
    一九五八年九月十八日，我们伟大领袖毛主席视察了合肥钢厂。这是合肥钢厂历史上最光辉灿烂最幸福的一天。在十八日的集会上，合肥钢厂全体职工一致表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把合肥钢厂办成亦工亦农，亦文亦武的革命化大学校。
    八年来，全厂职工念念不忘毛主席的教导，遵循毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进。他们把这个小钢厂建设成为一个拥有多座炼钢炉，能炼钢、轧钢又能生产耐火材料的钢厂。现在，这座钢厂不仅在产量上比一九五八年提高了十一倍，而且钢材品种也有了很大的发展。
    几年来，合肥钢厂革命职工掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，促进了职工思想革命化和企业革命化。在当前无产阶级文化大革命运动中，广大职工抓革命，促生产，今年一至八月份与去年同期相比，钢产量增长了百分之十三，钢材产量增长了百分之十二，钢材品种增加了三十六个，规格增加了一百三十五种，产品质量也显著提高。
