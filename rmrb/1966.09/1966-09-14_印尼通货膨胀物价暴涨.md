The Indonesian newspaper "The Fire of the Five Principles of the State" recently published an article admitting that Indonesia is experiencing severe currency inflation and skyrocketing prices. The article states: Daily necessities can be said to increase in price every day, always making women gasp for breath. Women who frequently go to the market say: "If in 1955, one thousand old rupiahs could buy a basket full of food, today that amount of money can only buy ten chilies."

The newspaper reports that in late August, the prices of daily necessities rose by 10% to 25%. Compared to last month, the prices of textiles have increased by 40% to 60%.

The newspaper admits that the currency in circulation in January this year was 33,810.4 billion rupiahs, but by July, it had increased to 100 billion rupiahs.
