On August 28, I was returning from Shenyang to Tonghua. The train was about to depart, and I hurried towards the waiting room with my luggage. Suddenly, I heard a child crying. I turned around and saw a young man with a red armband holding a crying child. The young man was wiping the child's tears and comforting him, saying, "Don't cry, don't cry, Mommy's coming, Mommy's coming..." as if he were comforting his own little brother.

At that moment, a middle-aged woman rushed over, anxiously saying, "Oh no, I've lost my ticket! What am I going to do?" She was saying this while looking around on the ground. The child stopped crying and reached out his arms, calling for his mother. The young man handed the child to the woman and asked, "Auntie, where are you going?" "Oh dear! I'm going to Dalian. Now I've lost my ticket, and I don't have enough money to buy another one. What am I going to do?" The young man replied, "Auntie, don't worry. You take care of the child. I'll go find the ticket for you," and then he quickly ran into the ticket office. At this point, I realized that they did not know each other, and my respect for our young Red Guards grew. I thought, I should help this aunt buy another ticket; but the train was about to leave, what should I do? I remembered the story of Lei Feng helping an old lady in the rain to send her child, and I decided that even if I missed the train, I would make sure this matter was taken care of.

Just as I was about to rush out of the waiting room, I saw the young man hurriedly running back, shouting, "Auntie, the ticket is found! Hurry and get on the train!" I let out a sigh of relief. The woman excitedly took the ticket, tears in her eyes, and repeatedly said, "Thank you so much, thank you so much!"

Sitting on the train, I kept thinking about this incident: the young man's spirit of serving the people is truly worth learning from; and how did the ticket get found so conveniently? I looked up and saw many Red Guards in the car. Some were pouring water for the passengers, and others were busy wiping the floor. I understood: the Red Guards are learning from Lei Feng; they are all Chairman Mao's good soldiers. We soldiers feel endless pride to have such a reserve force!

    在车站上发生的事
    八月二十八日，我从沈阳回通化去。列车快要开了，我提着行李急忙往候车室走去。忽然听到一阵孩子的哭声，我回头一看，只见一个臂戴红袖章的红卫兵，抱着一个正在啼哭的小孩。那小青年一边给孩子擦眼泪，一边哄着孩子：“别哭、别哭，妈妈来了，妈妈来了……”像是在哄他的小弟弟。
    这时候，一个中年妇女慌慌张张地过来，焦急地说：“真糟糕，车票丢了，这可咋办哪？”边说，边低头四下寻找。孩子听到声音，不哭了，伸着手叫妈妈，红卫兵把孩子递给那位妇女，关心地问：“大婶，你是到什么地方去呀？”“嗐！我是到大连去，这下可糟了，丢了车票，剩的钱又不够再买票，这可咋办哪？”只听红卫兵说了声：“大婶别急，你看着孩子，我替你去找。”就一溜烟跑进了票房。这时我才知道，原来他们并不相识，心里顿时对我们的红卫兵小将起了敬意。我想，我应该帮助这位大婶再买一张车票；但是开车的时间就到了，怎么办？我想起了雷锋冒雨帮助大娘送孩子的事迹，就决定自己误了车也要办好这件事。
    当我刚要奔出候车室，只见那位红卫兵已急急忙忙跑过来，嘴里喊着：“大婶，票找到了，快准备上车吧！”我一听才松了口气，那位妇女激动地接过票，含着泪花连声说：“太谢谢你啦，太谢谢你啦！”
    坐在火车上，我尽琢磨着这件事：这位红卫兵热心为人民服务的精神真值得学习；还有那张车票，怎么那么巧，红卫兵一到票房就找到了呢？抬头一看，只见车厢里有许多红卫兵，有的在为旅客倒水，有的忙着擦地板。我明白了：红卫兵们在学习雷锋，他们都是毛主席的好战士。我们解放军为有这样一批后备力量而感到无限的自豪！
