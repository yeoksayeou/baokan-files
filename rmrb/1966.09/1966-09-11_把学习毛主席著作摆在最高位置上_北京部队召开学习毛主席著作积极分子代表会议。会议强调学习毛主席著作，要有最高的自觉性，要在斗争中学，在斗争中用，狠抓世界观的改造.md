The Beijing Military Region recently held a conference for representatives of active participants in the study of Chairman Mao's works. The conference emphasized that the study of Chairman Mao's works must be approached with the highest level of awareness, learned and applied in the midst of struggle, and must focus on transforming one's worldview.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, how can one truly master Mao Zedong Thought? The representatives at the conference for active participants in the study of Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Military Region in early September believe that to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, one must have the highest level of awareness, place it in the highest position, learn in the midst of struggle, apply in the midst of struggle, and focus on transforming one's worldview.

The representatives said: The highest level of awareness is to have an unlimited love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, to have a deep class sentiment for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, to firmly believe and steadfastly adhere to it, and to do as Chairman Mao says. Truly achieving: Among all principles, the first is to study Chairman Mao's works, among all busyness, never forget to study Chairman Mao's works.

How can one have the highest level of awareness for studying Chairman Mao's works and place it in the highest position? Everyone believes: First, one must have a high level of proletarian awareness. The representatives said: The higher the proletarian awareness, the deeper the sentiment for Chairman Mao's works, and the higher the awareness of study. Second, one must have a deep understanding of the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought. Many comrades have such high awareness of study because they have deeply understood from the party's decades of struggle history and the current domestic and international class struggles that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul and lifeline of our party, the guiding principle for all our actions, and the beacon of the world revolution. Third, through class struggle, ideological transformation, and practical work, one must continuously summarize and experience the sweetness of studying Chairman Mao's works, and improve the awareness of study. The representatives deeply felt that without studying Chairman Mao's works, one would lose their soul and direction, and would definitely go astray. Only by continuously improving the awareness of study can one resolutely and wholeheartedly study, fully and sincerely study, and forget about sleep and food to study. Live to make revolution, make revolution to study.

How to study? Everyone pointed out: The most fundamental thing is to learn in the midst of struggle and apply in the midst of struggle. Many representatives said: Mao Zedong Thought is the philosophy of struggle, learning in the midst of struggle and applying in the midst of struggle is determined by the essence of Mao Zedong Thought. The study and application of Mao Zedong Thought itself is a class struggle, it is the use and mastery of Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to struggle against everything that goes against and opposes Mao Zedong Thought. Without struggle, one cannot talk about active learning and application, and it is impossible to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Some representatives pointed out in their speeches that in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the struggle between two military thoughts and two military lines, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works has the deepest understanding and the best results, and can best implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on studying Chairman Mao's works to learn with questions, actively learn and apply, combine learning with application, learn what is urgently needed first, see immediate results, and focus on application.

Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Focusing on application is fundamentally to focus on transforming one's worldview. Many representatives, when introducing their experiences, said: The transformation of worldview is a serious struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology. To do well in this struggle, one must have a thorough spirit of self-revolution. Many comrades' common experience in transforming their thoughts is: dare to expose, fiercely struggle, and set high standards. This is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, to put oneself "into it," to expose one's thoughts, to face Chairman Mao's works, to face the organization, and to face the masses. When struggling against one's non-proletarian thoughts, one must not fear ugliness or pain, and must always remember to use the five conditions of a proletarian revolutionary successor to demand of oneself.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "China will prosper if it arms the people with Mao Zedong Thought." The representatives expressed that they will definitely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, not only to strive to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works themselves, but also to make every unit a propaganda team and a seed-sower of Mao Zedong Thought, and to make every comrade a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives finally unanimously pointed out: Currently, China's socialist revolution has entered a new stage, and the movement of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is flourishing. We must definitely make this military academy of Mao Zedong Thought even better.

    把学习毛主席著作摆在最高位置上
    北京部队召开学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议。会议强调学习毛主席著作，要有最高的自觉性，要在斗争中学，在斗争中用，狠抓世界观的改造
    据新华社十日讯　怎样才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手？人民解放军北京部队九月初召开的学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议的代表们认为：要学好用好毛主席著作，必须有最高的自觉，摆在最高的位置上，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，狠抓世界观的改造。
    代表们说：最高的自觉，就是对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想怀有深厚的阶级感情，坚信不疑，坚定不移，毛主席怎么说就怎么做。真正做到：千条万条，学习毛主席著作第一条，千忙万忙，学习毛主席著作永不忘。
    怎样才能对学习毛主席著作有最高的自觉，而且摆在最高位置上？大家认为：首先是要有高度的无产阶级觉悟。代表们说：无产阶级觉悟越高，对毛主席著作的感情就越深，学习的自觉性就越高。第二是对毛泽东思想的伟大意义有深刻的认识。许多同志学习自觉性所以那么高，是由于他们从我党的几十年的斗争历史中和当前国内外阶级斗争中，深刻地认识到，毛泽东思想是我们党的灵魂和命根子，是我们一切行动的指导方针，是世界革命的灯塔。第三要通过阶级斗争、思想改造和工作实践，不断总结和体会学习毛主席著作的甜头，提高学习的自觉性。代表们深深感到，不学习毛主席著作，就要失掉灵魂，迷失方向，就一定会走到邪路上去。只有不断提高学习自觉性，才能下定决心满腔热情地学，全心全意地学，废寝忘食地学。活着干革命，干革命就要学习。
    怎样学？大家指出：最根本的是在斗争中学，在斗争中用。许多代表说：毛泽东思想是斗争哲学，在斗争中学，在斗争中用是毛泽东思想的本质所决定的。学习和运用毛泽东思想本身就是阶级斗争，就是运用和掌握毛泽东思想这个武器和一切违背毛泽东思想、反对毛泽东思想的东西斗。不斗争，就谈不到活学活用，也就不可能把毛泽东思想学到手。有些代表在发言中指出，在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，在两种建军思想、两条建军路线的斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，体会最深，效果最好，最能贯彻林彪同志关于学习毛主席著作要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫的指示。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。在用字上狠下功夫，最根本的就是要在改造世界观上狠下功夫。许多代表在介绍自己的经验时说：世界观的改造，是一场严重的灭资兴无的斗争。要搞好这场斗争，必须有彻底的自我革命精神。许多同志改造思想的共同经验是：敢亮、狠斗、高标准。这就是活学活用毛主席著作要把自己“摆进去”，把思想“亮出来”，同毛主席著作见面，同组织见面，同群众见面。对自己的非无产阶级思想进行斗争的时候，要不怕丑，不怕痛，时时不忘用无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件来要求自己。
    林彪同志说：“中国要兴旺，就要用毛泽东思想武装人民群众。”代表们表示，一定要响应林彪同志的号召，不仅自己努力活学活用毛主席著作，而且每一个单位，都要成为毛泽东思想的宣传队、播种机，每一个同志，都要成为毛泽东思想的宣传员。
    到会代表最后一致指出：当前，我国社会主义革命进入了一个新的阶段，亿万工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作的运动正在蓬勃发展。我们一定把部队这座毛泽东思想的大学校办得好上加好。
