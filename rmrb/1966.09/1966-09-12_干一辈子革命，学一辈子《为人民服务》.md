	Learning "In Service of the People" Broadens One's Vision and Aspirations
	— A Soldier's Discussion on the 22nd Anniversary of the Publication of Chairman Mao's "In Service of the People"
	Xinhua News Agency, September 11th

	On the eve of the 22nd anniversary of Chairman Mao's "In Service of the People," soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army of China held pen discussions, sharing their experiences and insights from studying this article.

	A Lifetime of Revolution, a Lifetime of Studying "In Service of the People"
	Zhuang Soldier Tang Qixiang

	When I first enlisted, I thought that being a radio operator meant sitting in a room all day, avoiding the sun and rain, with good working conditions and the opportunity to learn skills. I thought, since I have a higher level of education, the leadership should assign me to be a radio operator.

	But things did not go as I wished. The organization assigned me to the reconnaissance platoon instead. Being a reconnaissance soldier is hard and tiring, and I was a bit reluctant to do it. I often lacked the spirit to do my work. The platoon leader and old comrades noticed this and had a heart-to-heart talk with me. They patiently educated me, explaining that all work is for the service of the people, and shared their insights from studying "In Service of the People." This greatly inspired me.

	So, I started studying "In Service of the People" with my own questions in mind. Chairman Mao said, "Our army is entirely for the people, and it is thoroughly for the people's interests." I thought, Zhang Zhedong followed Chairman Mao in the revolution, suffered injuries, shed blood, and when the Party asked him to make charcoal, he did so without hesitation, never calculating his personal gains and losses. I am also a revolutionary soldier. Why should I pick and choose my revolutionary work? Is this following Chairman Mao's words? The more I thought about it, the more I felt I was wrong, and the more I realized I lacked the words "completely" and "thoroughly."

	Once my thoughts were clear, I worked with a willing heart. Although reconnaissance work is hard and tiring, I thought of Zhang Zhedong's spirit of fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and everything became bearable.

	Over the past few years, through repeated study of "In Service of the People," I have deeply felt that every word and sentence in this article is the truth. Studying this article has made me stand tall, see far, have a broad mind, and great aspirations. I am determined to be like Zhang Zhedong, doing whatever the Party asks, definitely dedicating a lifetime to the revolution, a lifetime to studying "In Service of the People," and a lifetime to listening to Chairman Mao's words.

    学习《为人民服务》使人胸怀广阔、理想远大
    ——解放军某部战士笔谈《为人民服务》发表二十二周年
    新华社十一日讯　毛主席《为人民服务》一文发表二十二周年的前夕，中国人民解放军某部战士纷纷写文章开笔谈会，畅谈学习这篇文章的心得体会。
    干一辈子革命，学一辈子《为人民服务》壮族
    战士  唐奇香
    刚入伍那阵，我认为当无线电兵天天坐在屋里，日不晒，雨不淋，工作条件好，又能学技术，心里就想，自己文化程度高，领导上最好能分配自己当无线电兵。
    但事与愿违，组织上偏偏把我分配到侦察连。干侦察兵又苦又累，我有点不想干，干工作常打不起精神来。班长和老同志看出来了，就找我谈心，耐心地教育我，给我讲一切工作都是为人民服务的道理，并把他们学习《为人民服务》的心得讲给我听，使我受到很大启发。
    于是，我就带着自己的问题学习《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我想，张思德同志跟着毛主席干革命，负过伤，流过血，党叫他去烧炭，他就去烧炭，从不计较个人的得失。我也是一个革命战士，为什么对革命工作要挑挑拣拣呢？这算是听毛主席的话吗？越想越觉得自己不对，越想越感到自己缺乏的正是“完全”“彻底”四个字。
    思想通了，我工作也就安心了，侦察工作虽然苦些累些，但我想到张思德同志不怕苦不怕累的精神，一切都不在话下了。
    这几年来，通过反复学习《为人民服务》，我深刻地体会到：这篇文章字字句句都是真理。学了这篇文章，使我站得高，看得远，有广阔的胸怀，远大的理想。我决心像张思德同志那样，党说干啥就干啥，一定干一辈子革命，学一辈子《为人民服务》，听一辈子毛主席的话。
