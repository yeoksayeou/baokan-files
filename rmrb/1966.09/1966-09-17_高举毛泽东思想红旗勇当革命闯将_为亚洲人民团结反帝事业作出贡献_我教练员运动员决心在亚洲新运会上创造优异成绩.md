Coaches and athletes participating in the selection trials for the first Asian New Forces Games have been expressing their determination to the Xinhua News Agency reporters over the past few days. They have vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and bring the revolutionary enthusiasm sparked by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the Asian New Games, which will soon be held in Phnom Penh.

Containers Guanzhong, coach of the Chinese table tennis team, and world men's singles champion Zhuang Zedong said, "The upcoming first Asian New Forces Games embody the revolutionary spirit of the people of the new Asian forces in their struggle for friendship, mutual promotion, common development, and unity against imperialism. This expresses the common desire of the peoples of Asian countries to independently and autonomously develop sports. It is a powerful blow to the imperialists' monopoly and control over international sports." They expressed their firm support for the holding of the Asian New Games, vowing to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive to achieve excellent results in the New Games, contributing to the cause of unity against imperialism.

Outstanding high jumper Ni Zhiqun, female long jumper Xiao Jieping, and female discus thrower Liu Dehui also spoke to reporters. They pointed out that for many years, due to the manipulation and monopoly of imperialism, the development of sports in Asia and friendly exchanges between the peoples of various countries have been severely obstructed. They believe that the upcoming Asian New Games demonstrate the demands and strength of the Asian people for unity against imperialism. Through the Asian New Games, friendship between the peoples and athletes of various Asian countries will be enhanced, experiences will be exchanged, and new paths for sports development will be opened. They vowed to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to be revolutionary pioneers; at the same time, they will train with great revolutionary enthusiasm and strive to achieve excellent results.

Weightlifter Deng Guoyin said: "For Chinese athletes participating in the first Asian New Games, the outcome of the competition is not the main thing; what is important is to deepen friendship and understanding with the peoples and athletes of various Asian countries through this rare gathering, and contribute to the cause of unity against imperialism for the peoples of Asia and the world. We must make this Games a success and a spectacular event." Football coach Ren Bin said: "This Games is a grand event for exchanging experiences, mutual learning, complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses, and common improvement. It will have a great promoting effect on the development of sports in Asia. We are full of excitement to support and cheer for the holding of this historic Games."

Basketball player Ma Jiaxi said: "In just two months, we will gather with athletes from various Asian countries in Phnom Penh. In this short preparation period, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, further improve our athletic skills, and welcome the Asian New Games with practical actions."

Chinese athletes have expressed their firm support for the recent statement by the National Organizing Committee of the first Asian New Forces Games in Cambodia, strongly condemning the plot by imperialism and its lackeys to sabotage this Games. Famous swimmer Fu Dajin said: "U.S. imperialism and reactionaries in various countries are plotting to sabotage this Games. We must resolutely foil this imperialist plot. Chairman Mao said: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again... until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries throughout the world in dealing with the people's cause, and they will never deviate from this logic.' The plot by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices to sabotage the Asian New Games will surely fail, and the first Asian New Games will definitely be held successfully and achieve success."
