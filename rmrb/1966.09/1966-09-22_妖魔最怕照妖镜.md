Editor's Note: The chief accomplice of the head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the cultural sphere, Zhou Yang, Lin Mohan, has long usurped important positions such as Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture. Lin Mohan, in collusion with Zhou Yang, shamelessly resisted and opposed Chairman Mao's cultural line, promoting a thorough and complete revisionist cultural line.

Lin Mohan and Zhou Yang are both die-hard counter-revolutionary revisionists, and are capitalist roaders who have infiltrated the Party. For more than a decade, they have abused their power, issuing orders, acting one way in public and another in private, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. In the cultural sphere, as well as in the academic, educational, and publishing fields, they have done countless evil deeds.

Lin Mohan has consistently defamed and attacked the great Mao Zedong Thought, strenuously opposing the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He has always harbored resentment towards the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Especially during the three years of temporary economic difficulties, he openly advocated the "benefits" of "contracting production to households" and extolled the "wonders" of the "free market," attempting to achieve a capitalist restoration.

Lin Mohan has consistently opposed the Party's leadership in cultural work and opposed the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He has extensively promoted the bourgeois and revisionist cultural line. Together with Zhou Yang, he conspired to distort history and attack Lu Xun, attempting to reverse the verdict on the right-opportunist cultural line of the 1930s. With Zhou Yang, he raised the black flag of "mass culture," opening the door wide for the spread of all kinds of poisonous weeds. Together with Zhou Yang, he formed cliques, placed his cronies, and implemented bourgeois dictatorship in the cultural sphere.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has risen in a great wave, shattering the dream of a small handful of capitalist roaders in power to restore capitalism. Lin Mohan, with his counter-revolutionary political sensitivity, knew that his end was near, but he still stubbornly resisted, using every means to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Together with Zhou Yang, he used defense as offense, plotted false criticisms, staged false rectification movements, and even resorted to unscrupulous means, plagiarizing unpublished Party Central Committee documents to gain political capital, attempting to cover up and lay low for the demons to rise again.

The "Sixteen Points" formulated under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao clearly states: "The focus of this movement is to rectify those within the Party who are capitalist roaders in power." Zhou Yang and Lin Mohan are precisely those within the Party who are capitalist roaders in power, precisely the targets of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's artillery.

Zhou Yang and Lin Mohan, these capitalist roaders in power within the Party, once held great power, could wield the stick, issue directives, and give orders. They had power and influence, implementing bourgeois policies and bourgeois dictatorship in the cultural sphere. If we do not overthrow them, it is possible that socialism will degenerate into capitalism, and we will not be able to hold onto the proletarian's mountain stronghold. Therefore, the focus of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must be to strike down this small handful of capitalist roaders in power. This is our direction of struggle. We must firmly grasp this direction of struggle, aim correctly, and hit the target, striking them down so they never rise again.

Demons Fear the Demon-Mirror

Lin Mohan and his master Zhou Yang share a common trait: they are most hostile to Mao Zedong Thought and most afraid of the workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the Marxism-Leninism that transforms people's souls in contemporary times, and the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat. Revolutionary people all over the world love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought dearly. Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become the conscious actions of the broad masses of our country. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mohan is extremely hostile to the mass movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works, and to the practice of "studying with problems in mind, applying actively, combining study with use, learning urgently what is needed immediately, and seeing results quickly." He maliciously distorts and resists this practice, slandering that "mastering Mao Zedong Thought" is "simplification" and "vulgarization"; attacking "seeing results quickly" as "simplification" and "vulgarization"; attacking the attribution of all specific achievements and scientific inventions to Mao Zedong Thought as "simplification" and "vulgarization." He tried to use these two sticks to suppress the workers, peasants, and soldiers from actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He also maliciously slandered and viciously attacked the article by Comrade Zhuang Jiafu from the sports world on actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as a typical example of "simplification" and "vulgarization."

At the same time, he also maliciously defamed the great Mao Zedong Thought. In 1960, at a meeting, he said: "Studying Chairman Mao's works, there is no need to study individual views, because some are already outdated." This is sheer nonsense! Chairman Mao's works are revolutionary treasures and are the guiding principles for all our work. We must pass on Mao Zedong Thought, generation after generation, for thousands of years. Modern revisionists attack Marxism-Leninism as "outdated," and Lin Mohan parrots, shouting that Mao Zedong Thought is "outdated." What is Lin Mohan? Isn't it self-incriminating?

Why do Zhou Yang and Lin Mohan and their gang fear and hate Mao Zedong Thought so much? The reason is very simple: because Mao Zedong Thought is the biggest obstacle to their capitalist restoration. Mao Zedong Thought is the demon-mirror. All demons and ghosts will be exposed under its illumination, with nowhere to hide. Who among the demons would not fear the demon-mirror?

专栏：

    编者按：文艺界反革命修正主义集团总头目周扬的头号帮凶林默涵，曾经长期窃踞着中共中央宣传部副部长、文化部副部长等重要职务。林默涵与周扬一搭一档，狼狈为奸，疯狂地抵制和反对毛主席的文艺路线，推行了一条彻头彻尾的修正主义文艺路线。
    林默涵和周扬一样，都是道道地地的反革命修正主义分子，是钻进党内走资本主义道路的当权派。十多年来，他们滥用职权，发号施令，阴一套，阳一套，打着“红旗”反红旗，在文艺界以及在学术界、教育界、出版界，干尽了坏事。
    林默涵一贯诋毁和攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，极力反对工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作。一贯仇视总路线、大跃进、人民公社。特别是在三年经济暂时困难时期，他更公开鼓吹“包产到户”的“好处”，宣扬“自由市场”的“美妙”，妄想实现资本主义复辟。
    林默涵一贯反对党对文艺工作的领导，反对文艺为工农兵服务的方向，大肆宣扬资产阶级、修正主义的文艺路线。他与周扬共谋，篡改历史，围攻鲁迅，妄图为三十年代的右倾机会主义文艺路线翻案。他与周扬合伙，扯起了“全民文艺”的黑旗，为各种毒草的出笼大开方便之门。他与周扬一起，结党营私，安插亲信，在文艺界实行资产阶级专政。
    无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地兴起，粉碎了一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派复辟资本主义的迷梦。林默涵凭着反革命的政治敏感，自知末日已到，但仍然负隅顽抗，千方百计地破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他与周扬一起，以守为攻，策划假批判，导演假整风，甚至不择手段，剽窃未公开发表的党中央的有关文件，捞取政治资本，妄图为牛鬼蛇神的东山再起作掩护、打埋伏。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条明确指出：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”周扬、林默涵正是党内走资本主义道路的当权派，正是无产阶级文化大革命炮打的对象。
    周扬、林默涵这些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，他们手里曾经掌握着大权，可以挥舞棍棒，作指示、发命令。他们有权有势，在文艺界实行着资产阶级的政策，实行着资产阶级的专政。我们不把他们打倒，就可能使社会主义蜕化为资本主义，就保不住无产阶级的江山。因此，这次无产阶级文化大革命的重点，必须是打击他们这样一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这是我们斗争的大方向。我们一定要紧紧抓住这个斗争的大方向，正好炮位，瞄准目标，把他们打得落花流水，永世不得翻身。
    妖魔最怕照妖镜
    林默涵和他的主子周扬有一个共同的特点，这就是最仇视毛泽东思想，最害怕工农兵掌握毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。全世界革命人民都无比热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想。读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，已成为我国广大群众的自觉行动。但是，反革命修正主义分子林默涵对于工农兵学习毛主席著作的群众运动却十分仇视，对工农兵“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”，“决心把毛泽东思想学到手”的做法，极力进行歪曲和抵制。他污蔑“把毛泽东思想学到手”是“简单化”、“庸俗化”；攻击“立竿见影”是“简单化”、“庸俗化”；攻击“把一切具体工作成就，科学发明，都说成是毛泽东思想的结果”，也是“简单化”、“庸俗化”。他试图用这两根棍子，压制工农兵活学活用毛主席著作。他还把体育界庄家富同志活学活用毛主席著作的文章，当作“简单化”、“庸俗化”的典型大肆诽谤，恶毒攻击。
    与此同时，他对伟大的毛泽东思想也大加污蔑。一九六○年，他在一次会上说：“学习毛主席著作，不必学个别观点，因为有些已经过时了。”这简直是胡说八道！毛主席的著作是革命的宝书，是我们各项工作的指导方针。我们一定要把毛泽东思想接过来，传下去，子子孙孙，千秋万代地传下去。现代修正主义攻击马克思列宁主义已经“过时”，林默涵也鹦鹉学舌，跟着叫嚷毛泽东思想已经“过时”。林默涵是什么货色，岂不是不打自招了吗？
    周扬、林默涵一伙为什么这样仇视和害怕毛泽东思想呢？道理非常简单，因为毛泽东思想是他们实行资本主义复辟的最大障碍。毛泽东思想是照妖镜，一切牛鬼蛇神在她的照耀下，必然原形毕露，无处藏身，哪有不怕照妖镜的妖魔呢？
