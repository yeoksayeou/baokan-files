The workers and families of the Daqing Oilfield, taking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, have grasped both revolution and production with both hands. Both industry and agriculture have achieved bumper harvests. Recently, some advanced representatives from the Daqing Oilfield held a symposium. They unanimously agreed that every achievement of the oilfield is a victory of firmly holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and seizing the revolution and promoting production.

We are the main force in both the cultural revolution and the struggle for production, and we must shoulder these two responsibilities well.
		——Zhang Hongchi

Zhang Hongchi, a model worker of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the political instructor of the Logging Team of the Daqing Oilfield, said: The six years of the Daqing Battle have been six years of resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's great thought of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Every year, we have vigorously carried out class struggle, conducted winter political training, and launched various political movements. This is to arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought, continuously deepen the revolutionization of thought, and transform spiritual power into material power, thereby promoting the oilfield production to increase year by year. In this cultural revolution, we continue to advance on both the spiritual and material fronts. Our logging team this year has allocated one-third of our manpower and material resources to support sister units, but our production tasks have been completed better than in previous years. In the past, it took six hours to log one well, but now it only takes three to four hours. We workers and peasants are not only the main force in the cultural revolution but also the main force in the struggle for production. We must never forget the two responsibilities on our shoulders and must shoulder them well.

Put the enthusiasm and wisdom released in the cultural revolution into improving the speed of drilling.
		——Zhang Zhixin

Zhang Zhixin, the deputy political instructor of the 1205 Drilling Team, which recently drilled 50,000 meters in 218 days to reach the world's advanced level, said: As the cultural revolution deepens, people's thoughts become more revolutionized, and production develops more rapidly. Our team drilled five wells in May, seven wells in June, nine wells in July, and ten wells in August. At the beginning of this year, we proposed the goal of drilling 50,000 meters. Some bourgeois "authorities" said it was impossible. The workers did not listen to their nonsense at all. They put the enthusiasm and wisdom released in the cultural revolution into improving the speed of drilling, and as a result, they achieved the goal in just over half a year.

In the cultural revolution, we study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, promoting the good situation in the oilfield.
		——Xue Guobang

Xue Guobang, a model worker of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the deputy commander of the First Oil Production Department of Daqing, said: In the cultural revolution, the workers of the Daqing Oilfield have studied Chairman Mao's works more diligently, seized the revolution, and promoted production, and the oilfield production has shown a good situation. The crude oil production has exceeded the state plan month by month, and the production from January to August this year has increased by 26.5% compared to the same period last year. The management of oil wells has reached a higher level. In the past, a few people managed one well, but now one person can manage several or even a dozen wells. Not only are the wellhead equipment well-managed, but the changes in the underground oil layers are also clearly understood.

Treat the construction site as a battlefield for criticizing the bourgeoisie, achieving double victories in revolution and production.
		——Cai Ba'an

Cai Ba'an, the team leader of the Second Team of the Daqing Oilfield Construction Command, said: Since May this year, we have participated in the cultural revolution to denounce the anti-party and anti-socialist black gangs while accelerating construction. All the workers have turned their hatred for the enemy into sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm. In just ten days, we completed the first comprehensive station in the mining area, which includes oil transportation, water injection, power transformation, and oil dehydration. During the construction period, the workers treated the construction site as a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and as a battlefield for criticizing the bourgeoisie, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

Apprentices strive to create advanced instruments, refuting the fallacies of bourgeois "authorities."
		——Pan Xingguo

Pan Xingguo, a model worker of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and a young geologist of the Daqing Oilfield Development Research Institute, said: The engineering and technical personnel of our oilfield have released sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm in the cultural revolution and achieved many new successes in scientific experiments. Most of these new achievements were made by unknown young people. At the beginning of the year, some young people proposed to develop an automatic plotting instrument, but they were opposed by bourgeois "authorities." They said this was an advanced instrument, and only the United States had it. We could not do it. Everyone was very indignant. Comrades, with problems in mind, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, arousing the determination to strive for self-improvement. With the cooperation of sister units, everyone relied on collective wisdom and finally developed this instrument, strongly refuting the fallacies of bourgeois "authorities."

Our families have greatly improved their awareness in the cultural revolution, and their production enthusiasm is increasing.
		——Yu Wenlan

Yu Wenlan, a family member of the Daqing Oilfield workers and the deputy instructor of Benfeng Village, said: In the recent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we family members have studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the cultural revolution and the relevant decisions of the Party Central Committee, denounced the anti-party and anti-socialist black gangs, greatly improved our awareness, and increased our production enthusiasm. Agricultural management is better than ever before. The wheat yield of the already harvested wheat has increased significantly compared to previous years. The growth of the soon-to-be-harvested field crops is also very good, presenting a prosperous harvest scene.

    毛主席抓革命促生产伟大思想的新胜利
    大庆人两副担子挑得更好
    钻井速度飞快，原油产量大增，农业生产一片丰收景象
    大庆油田的广大职工和家属，以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，工农业生产都取得了丰收。最近，大庆油田的一部分先进代表人物举行座谈，他们一致认为油田的每一个成就，都是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命促生产的胜利。
    我们既是文化革命和生产斗争的主力军，就要挑好这两副担子。
                          ——张洪池
    石油工业部五好标兵、大庆油田测井中队指导员张洪池说：大庆会战六年，就是坚决贯彻毛主席抓革命促生产的伟大思想的六年。我们每年都大抓阶级斗争，搞冬季政治整训，进行各种政治运动，就是用毛泽东思想武装人们的头脑，不断加深入的思想革命化，使精神力量转化为物质力量，从而促进油田生产年年大幅度增长。在这次文化大革命中，我们继续在精神和物质两条战线上前进。我们测井队，今年抽出三分之一的人力和物力支援兄弟单位，可是生产任务却比往年完成得更好。过去测一口井，需要六个小时，现在只需要三四个小时就够了。我们工人农民，既是文化大革命的主力军，也是生产斗争的主力军。我们时刻不要忘记肩上的这两副担子，一定要把它挑好。
    把文化革命中焕发出的干劲和智慧，用到提高钻井速度方面。
                     ——张志训
    最近用二百一十八天钻井五万米达到世界先进水平的一二○五钻井队副政治指导员张志训说：随着文化大革命的不断深入，人的思想革命化也不断加深，生产就发展得更迅速。我们队五月份钻五口井，六月份增加到七口，七月份又增加到九口，八月份达到十口。今年年初，我们提出要打井五万米的目标，有些资产阶级“权威”说不行。工人们根本不听他们那一套，把在文化大革命中焕发出的革命干劲和聪明才智，用到了提高钻井速度方面，结果只用半年多的时间就提前达到了目标。
    在文化革命中更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，促成油田大好形势。
                      ——薛国帮
    石油工业部五好标兵、大庆采油一部副指挥薛国帮说：在文化大革命中，我们大庆油田的职工更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，油田生产出现了大好形势。原油产量月月超额完成国家计划，一至八月份的产量比去年同期增长百分之二十六点五。油井管理达到了更高的水平。过去几个人管一口井，现在一个人能管几口甚至十几口井，不但把井口设备管得很好，而且把地下油层的变化规律也摸得清清楚楚。
    把工地当作批判资产阶级的战场，取得了革命和生产双胜利。
                      ——蔡保安
    大庆油田建设指挥部二队队长蔡保安说：从今年五月份开始，我们一边参加文化大革命声讨反党反社会主义的黑帮，一边加紧施工。全体职工把对敌人的仇恨化为冲天的革命干劲，仅用十天时间就建成了矿区第一个包括输油、注水、变电、脱水的四用联合站。在施工期间，职工们把工地作为活学活用毛主席著作的课堂，当作批判资产阶级的战场，取得了革命和生产双胜利。
    学徒工奋发图强制成高级仪器，反击了资产阶级“权威”谬论。
                        ——潘兴国
    石油工业部五好标兵、大庆油田开发研究院青年地质师潘兴国说：我们油田的工程技术人员，在文化大革命中焕发出冲天的革命干劲，在科学实验中取得了许多新的成就。这些新成就，大多是无名小将搞出来的。年初，我们一些年青人提出要搞一个自动化刻图仪，可是却遭到了资产阶级“权威”的反对。他们说这是高级仪器，世界上只有美国才有，我们这些学徒工搞不成。大家听了很气愤。同志们带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，激起了奋发图强的决心。在兄弟单位的协作下，大家凭着集体的智慧，终于把这种仪器试制出来了，有力地反击了资产阶级“权威”的谬论。
    我们家属在文化大革命中觉悟大大提高，生产劲头越来越足。
                        ——于文兰
    大庆油田职工家属、奔腾村副指导员于文兰说：在最近的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们家属学习了毛主席关于文化大革命的指示和党中央的有关决定，声讨反党反社会主义黑帮，觉悟大大提高，生产劲头越来越足，农田管理比以往那一年都好。已经收割的小麦产量比往年有了大幅度增长。即将收割的大田作物长势也很好，呈现一派丰收景象。（据新华社讯）（附图片）
