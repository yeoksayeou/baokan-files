Indian people, burdened with deep suffering, have recently launched a new wave of struggles against hunger, for survival, and against oppression.

According to reports from Indian newspapers, in the town of Gwalior in the Central Province, when students of the Institute of Arts and Agriculture were starting a protest demonstration against the oppression of a reactionary police officer on September 14, the reactionary Indian police threw tear gas at the demonstrating students, who retaliated with bricks. On the 15th, the townspeople held demonstrations in various districts to protest the police suppression of students. The reactionary Indian police opened fire to suppress the demonstrators in two places, killing one demonstrator near the local High Court.

On the 16th, in another town in the Central Province, Kotwali, students held demonstrations, chanting slogans in support of the anti-oppression struggle of the Gwalior students. The reactionary Indian authorities again sent police to suppress them, beating many students with iron truncheons.

In the town of Balurghat in West Bengal, when the Chief Minister of the province, K.P. Sen, convened a meeting there on the 8th, local residents held a demonstration near the meeting venue. The reactionary Indian police used tear gas and batons to brutally suppress the demonstrators. The angry demonstrators bravely resisted, setting fire to the local Congress Party office. The residents of this town went on a general strike on the 9th to protest the government's suppression of the people.

In Damdam near Calcutta in West Bengal, as well as in Hooghly and Midnapore districts, there were many mass demonstrations on the 14th and 15th.

According to the Indian News Agency on the 16th, the West Bengal government is requesting an additional battalion from the Central Reserve Police to help the reactionary police in the province suppress the people. Previously, five battalions of police forces had already been transferred from other provinces to West Bengal.

In Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, over 8,000 workers of the Swadeshi Cotton Mill went on strike on the 6th, demanding wage increases and the abolition of the contract system.
