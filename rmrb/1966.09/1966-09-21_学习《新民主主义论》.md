The editorial board of the *Liberation Army Daily* comments: Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy," published during the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, is a brilliant work of epoch-making significance, with great world-historical and profound historical significance.

In this great work, Chairman Mao creatively applied the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, comprehensively and profoundly analyzed the world situation and the characteristics of Chinese society since the October Revolution, summarized the basic experiences of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, revealed the objective laws of the world proletarian revolution, especially the revolutionary movements of the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and provided the most correct and complete political, economic, and cultural programs for the new democratic revolution in China. It pointed the way for all oppressed nations and peoples to achieve victory in the new democratic revolution and advance towards socialism, greatly enriching and developing the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

In this great work, Chairman Mao thoroughly criticized the opportunist political and cultural lines of Wang Ming, systematically and profoundly summarized the basic experiences of the proletarian cultural revolution in China and internationally, and proposed the most correct and complete proletarian cultural line of national, scientific, and popular culture, opening up a broad road for the development of proletarian culture in China.

Chairman Mao's great work, along with "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China," is the highest peak of contemporary Marxist-Leninist worldview and art theory, and is a programmatic document guiding the current proletarian cultural revolution. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers of our army must link the current revolutionary struggle with the study of this great work, arm our minds with the great thoughts in this work, and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, forever defending our proletarian iron fortress.

To help comrades study this great work, we have compiled this guide for reference by comrades in the platoons.

Historical Background

Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy" is a classic work of Marxism-Leninism with epoch-making significance. This work was published in January 1940. At that time, the great War of Resistance Against Japan was in a difficult phase of stalemate, and the situation of the War of Resistance had undergone significant changes. The atmosphere of compromise and surrender was rampant, and anti-communist sentiments were on the rise. "Where is China heading?" became a central concern for the entire nation.

After the Japanese invaders occupied Wuhan and Guangzhou in October 1938, they stopped their strategic offensive on the main battlefield and concentrated their main forces on a ferocious attack against the anti-Japanese base areas led by our Party. Towards the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, they adopted a policy of political seduction and surrender. The British and American imperialists, in order to deal with the war for colonial plunder launched by the German and Italian Fascists, intensified their efforts to persuade the Kuomintang reactionaries to surrender, aiming to sacrifice China to achieve a compromise with Japan and preserve their interests in China, realizing the "Eastern Munich" plot.

Under the conditions of Japanese seduction and American and British persuasion, the pro-Japanese faction within the Kuomintang, led by Wang Jingwei, openly surrendered to Japan. The American and British faction, led by Chiang Kai-shek, adopted a policy of passive resistance and active anti-communism, colluding with Japanese imperialism and intensifying their anti-communist steps. They issued a series of counter-revolutionary documents, including the "Regulations on Restricting the Activities of Other Parties," and created a series of bloody incidents against the people. By the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1940, Chiang Kai-shek launched the first wave of anti-communist attacks, ferociously attacking the anti-Japanese people in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and other areas led by our Party, attempting to annihilate the revolutionary forces of the people and clear the way for surrendering to the Japanese invaders. At the same time, the Kuomintang reactionaries mobilized their entire propaganda machine, singing the praises of Fascist dictatorship, fiercely attacking communism, and advocating the so-called "one-stage revolution theory," claiming that "communism is not suitable for the national conditions," and calling for the abolition of the Communist Party, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and all anti-Japanese base areas led by the Communist Party, preparing public opinion for surrendering to the Japanese invaders.

Within the Party, the right-opportunist representatives, led by Wang Ming, opposed the correct line formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong, denied the Party's leadership in the anti-Japanese national united front, opposed the strategic line of independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare, and advocated "everything through the united front" and "everything subordinate to the united front," essentially advocating surrender to the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek. They opposed mobilizing the masses and improving the lives of workers and peasants, deliberately undermining the worker-peasant alliance. They opposed the creation and leadership of anti-Japanese revolutionary base areas by our Party, opposed the expansion of liberated areas and people's armies in the enemy's rear, and even advocated handing over the people's armed forces to Chiang Kai-shek. The Central Committee of the Party, led by Chairman Mao, resolutely fought against Wang Ming's line of capitulation. However, the influence of Wang Ming's erroneous line had not been eliminated and continued to harm the revolutionary cause to a certain extent.

The struggle between the two lines within the Party was also reflected in the cultural front at that time. The central issue of the struggle was whether to take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology of culture or to take the bourgeois, revisionist ideology of Wang Ming's right-opportunism as the guiding ideology of culture. The debate over the two slogans in the left-wing literary movement in 1936 was a reflection of this struggle. The group led by Zhou Yang faithfully implemented Wang Ming's class capitulationist ideology, proposing the bourgeois slogan of "national defense literature," openly erasing class contradictions, and betraying the interests of the proletariat. They fiercely slandered and attacked Lu Xun, who insisted on the correct thoughts of Chairman Mao and proposed the proletarian slogan of "national revolutionary war literature for the masses." Under the guidance of the revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang, "national defense theater," "national defense film," and many novels with the label of "all-people" flooded the literary world, poisoning the broad masses and causing extremely serious harm to the revolutionary cause.

At this critical historical juncture, the question of where China was heading and what line we should adopt to achieve victory in the War of Resistance and ultimately achieve a thorough victory in the democratic revolution became the central concern of the entire Party and the nation. To answer this question, Chairman Mao published the great Marxist-Leninist work "On New Democracy."

Great Significance

Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy," this great work of epoch-making significance, brilliantly and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. It is a guide for the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and peoples to achieve liberation, and a programmatic document for the proletariat to lead the democratic revolution and advance towards socialism.

In this great work, Chairman Mao comprehensively, systematically, and profoundly summarized the basic experiences of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, revealed the laws of development of the world proletarian revolution, especially the revolutionary movements of the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and scientifically formulated the political, economic, and cultural programs of the new democratic revolution, pointing the way for the proletarian revolutionary movement. This great work not only illuminated the historical process of the Chinese revolution, guiding our country's revolution to achieve great victories, but also opened up the road to complete victory for the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples against imperialism and its running dogs. It is a powerful ideological weapon for all revolutionary peoples of the contemporary world to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and to strive for complete liberation.

Chairman Mao's great work and the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" published two years later, brilliantly and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory. It not only systematically criticized the opportunist political and cultural lines of Wang Ming, scientifically summarized the basic experiences of the revolutionary cultural movement in China since the May Fourth Movement, but also scientifically summarized the basic experiences of the international proletarian revolutionary cultural movement. It most completely, comprehensively, and systematically summarized the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front. This is the first time in the history of proletarian revolution that the most complete, thorough, and correct Marxist-Leninist cultural line has been proposed.

Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China" are important components of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the highest peak of contemporary Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory, the highest criterion for our literary work, the programmatic document of the proletarian cultural revolutionary movement, the compass of the current proletarian cultural revolution in our country, and the sharpest ideological weapon for eliminating bourgeois ideology, establishing proletarian ideology, transforming people's souls, achieving the ideological revolutionization of people, uprooting the roots of revisionism, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, and developing the socialist system. Seriously studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works, mastering and applying this sharpest ideological weapon, can achieve invincibility, sweep away all obstacles, and achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

Content Summary

This work is divided into fifteen sections:

1. **Where is China Heading?**
   The atmosphere of compromise and anti-communist sentiments are on the rise again, and the question of where China is heading has become a problem once more. Taking the opportunity of the publication of *Chinese Culture*, we will explain the direction of Chinese politics and culture.

2. **We Must Build a New China**
   We not only want to transform a China that is politically oppressed and economically exploited into a China that is politically free and economically prosperous, but also want to transform a China that is ruled by old culture and is therefore backward and ignorant into a China that is ruled by new culture and is therefore civilized and advanced.

3. **The Historical Characteristics of China**
   A certain culture (as an ideological form of culture) is a reflection of the politics and economics of a certain society, and it exerts a great influence and effect on the politics and economics of a certain society; while the economy is the foundation, politics is the concentrated expression of the economy.

   China is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. The historical process of the Chinese revolution must be divided into two steps: the first step is the democratic revolution, and the second step is the socialist revolution. These are two revolutionary processes of different natures. The first step is no longer the old democracy but the new democracy.

4. **The Chinese Revolution is Part of the World Revolution**
   The Chinese revolution is a great part of the world revolution. The First World War and the first victorious socialist October Revolution changed the entire direction of world history and divided the entire era of world history. In this era, any colonial and semi-colonial country, if a revolution against imperialism occurs, it no longer belongs to the category of the old world bourgeois democratic revolution but belongs to the new category; it is no longer part of the old bourgeois and capitalist world revolution but part of the new world revolution, that is, the proletarian socialist world revolution.

5. **The Politics of New Democracy**
   The democratic revolution in China must be led by the proletariat. The state to be established in this revolutionary stage can only be a democratic republic of the united dictatorship of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal people under the leadership of the proletariat. Its form of government can adopt the system of universal and equal elections of the people's congresses, that is, democratic centralism. State system—united dictatorship of revolutionary classes. Political system—democratic centralism. This is the politics of new democracy.

6. **The Economy of New Democracy**
   Large banks, large industries, and large commerce should belong to this republic of the state. The state-owned economy under the leadership of the proletariat in the new democratic republic is of a socialist nature and is the leading force of the entire national economy. The land of the landlords should be confiscated and distributed to the landless and poor peasants, eliminating feudal relations in the countryside. It is absolutely not allowed for a few capitalists and a few landlords to "control the livelihood of the people."

7. **Refuting Bourgeois Dictatorship**
   The current world is in a new era of revolution and war, an era in which capitalism is definitely doomed and socialism is definitely thriving. Under such circumstances, after the victory of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution in China, to establish a bourgeois dictatorship of capitalist society is completely a delusion. In today's international environment, any heroes in colonial and semi-colonial countries, either stand on the side of imperialism and become part of the world counter-revolutionary forces, or stand on the side of anti-imperialism and become part of the world revolutionary forces, one of the two must be chosen, and there is no other way.

8. **Refuting "Left" Adventurism**
   The Chinese revolution must be carried out in two steps: the first step is new democracy, and the second step is socialism. Some malicious propagandists deliberately confuse these two different revolutionary stages, advocating the so-called "one-stage revolution theory," using it to prove that all revolutions are included in the Three Principles of the People, vigorously opposing communism and the Communist Party. Their purpose is to fundamentally eliminate any revolution and prepare public opinion for surrendering to the Japanese invaders. Some people, seemingly without malicious intent, are also confused by the so-called "one-stage revolution theory," confused by the so-called "completing political revolution and social revolution in one go" purely subjective idea, confusing the steps of the revolution, which is also very harmful.

9. **Refuting the Diehards**
   Communism is the entire ideological system of the proletariat and at the same time a new social system. This ideological system and social system are the most complete, progressive, revolutionary, and rational since the existence of human history. The so-called "one ideology" of the bourgeois diehards is essentially the bourgeois despotism of the diehards. They shout to "put away" communism, but in fact, this is "putting away" not possible. The Chinese revolution, without the guidance of communism, is definitely doomed to failure. The current world relies on communism as a savior; the current China is also the same.

10. **Old and New Three Principles of the People**
    The new Three Principles of the People are the Three Principles of the People of the policy of alliance with the Soviet Union, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants, which are basically the same as the political program of the Communist Party in the stage of the democratic revolution. The old Three Principles of the People have no basic points in common with the minimum program of communism.

11. **The Culture of New Democracy**
    New culture is the reflection in the ideological form of new politics and new economics, serving new politics and new economics. Imperialist culture and semi-feudal culture serve imperialism and the feudal class, and they form a reactionary alliance in the cultural field, opposing the new culture of China. Without overthrowing the reactionary old culture, no new culture can be established. Not breaking down, not stopping, not going forward is not possible; their struggle is a life-and-death struggle.

12. **The Historical Characteristics of the Chinese Cultural Revolution**
    In the cultural or ideological front of China, the period before and after the May Fourth Movement constitutes two different historical periods. Before the May Fourth Movement, the cultural revolution in China was led by the bourgeoisie and was part of the bourgeois capitalist cultural revolution of the world. After the May Fourth Movement, it was led by the proletarian cultural thought, that is, communist thought, and was part of the socialist cultural revolution of the world. The new democratic culture is the culture of the people led by the proletariat, opposing imperialism and feudalism. The direction of Lu Xun is the direction of the new culture of the Chinese nation.

13. **Four Periods**
    In China, the cultural revolution, like the political revolution, has a united front. Over the past twenty years, it has gone through four periods.

    The first period is from the May Fourth Movement in 1919 to the founding of the Communist Party of China in 1921, a period of two years. This period is mainly marked by the May Fourth Movement. The second period is from 1921 to 1927, a period of six years. It is marked by the founding of the Communist Party of China and the May 30th Movement and the Northern Expedition. The third period is from 1927 to 1937, a period of ten years of the new revolution. The fourth period is from 1937, the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The entire history of China, the progress of the past twenty years since the May Fourth Movement, not only surpassed the previous eighty years but almost surpassed the previous few thousand years. The rampant darkness of all internal and external dark forces not only shows that these dark forces still have strength but also shows their last struggles, showing that the people are gradually approaching victory.

14. **Deviations in the Problem of Cultural Nature**
    As a guideline for national culture, the guiding ideology is communist thought. We should expand the propaganda of communist thought and intensify the study of Marxism-Leninism. Without such propaganda and study, not only can we not guide the Chinese revolution to the future socialist stage, but we can also not guide the current democratic revolution to victory. The content of the new national culture in the stage of the new democratic revolution is neither bourgeois cultural despotism nor pure proletarian socialism but is the new democratic culture of the people led by proletarian socialist cultural thought, opposing imperialism and feudalism.

15. **National, Scientific, and Popular Culture**
    The new democratic culture is national. It opposes imperialist oppression, advocates the dignity and independence of the Chinese nation, and is our nation's, bearing the characteristics of our nation. The new democratic culture is scientific. It opposes all feudal and superstitious thoughts, advocates seeking truth from facts, advocates objective truth, and advocates the consistency of theory and practice. The new democratic culture is popular and therefore democratic. It should serve the more than ninety percent of the working and peasant masses in the entire nation and gradually become their culture. National, scientific, and popular culture is the culture of the people opposing imperialism and feudalism, the new democratic culture, and the new culture of the Chinese nation.

Key Points to Understand

In this brilliant work, Chairman Mao comprehensively, systematically, and profoundly discussed a series of major issues regarding the Chinese revolution's politics, economy, culture, and the leadership of the proletariat. In the current proletarian cultural revolution, we should focus on understanding the following issues:

1. **The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of political power. Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon to smash capitalist restoration and consolidate proletarian dictatorship.**

   Chairman Mao said: "A certain culture (as an ideological form of culture) is a reflection of the politics and economics of a certain society, and it exerts a great influence and effect on the politics and economics of a certain society; while the economy is the foundation, politics is the concentrated expression of the economy. This is our basic viewpoint on the relationship between culture and politics and economics."

   A certain form of culture is determined by a certain form of politics and economics. In a class society, culture as an ideological form is class-based; it always belongs to a certain class and is subordinate to a certain class's politics. As Chairman Mao said: "In the contemporary world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." A certain form of culture, after being formed on the basis of a certain form of politics and economics, in turn, actively influences a certain form of politics and economics. This means that culture, in relation to politics and economics, is not in a passive position but has relative independence and initiative. This influence is manifested in a certain culture always serving a certain class's politics and a certain society's economic base, helping and promoting their consolidation and development.

   Chairman Mao taught us: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the revolutionary general front." Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy. The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of political power. Revolutionary people want to seize political power, of course, rely on violence, rely on the gun, but without the revolutionary cultural movement, without ideological work, without sufficient public opinion preparation, it is also not possible. The new democratic revolution in our country started from the May Fourth cultural movement. The May Fourth cultural movement made necessary ideological preparations for the founding of our Party and the revolutionary wars led by the Party. In the long-term revolutionary struggle, revolutionary culture played a major role in uniting and educating the people and attacking the enemy, making us in spiritual strength absolutely superior to all enemies, ensuring the victory of the revolutionary struggle. This is as Chairman Mao said: "'Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement,' which shows the importance of the revolutionary cultural movement to the revolutionary practical movement."

   Our country is now in the great period of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Proletarian culture is our powerful ideological weapon for carrying out the revolution and construction. We are building socialism with two fronts, one is the material front, and the other is the spiritual front. We must hold on to the spiritual front and use the struggle on the spiritual front to drive the struggle on the material front. Because the struggles on these two fronts are all practical activities of people, and people always act under the control of a certain ideology. Different people's thoughts, the results of their practice are also different. Only with correct thoughts can there be correct actions. Thoughts must be won first, and then the material battle can be won. In the article "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" Chairman Mao's teachings highly summarized a great truth of dialectical materialism. Chairman Mao pointed out: "People's social existence determines people's thoughts. And the correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become the material force to transform society and the world." Therefore, we should focus on the ideological revolution, focus on the class struggle in the ideological field, arm the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and mobilize them. When the thoughts of the broad masses are revolutionized, they can be transformed into a great material force to transform society and the world, continuously pushing forward the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country.

   Chairman Mao taught us: "Cultural revolution is the reflection in the ideological form of political revolution and economic revolution, and serves them." In the past seventeen years since the founding of the country, our country has achieved great victories in the socialist revolution on the economic and political fronts. The proletarian dictatorship and the socialist economic base in our country are becoming more and more consolidated. However, in the ideological field, the issue of who will win between socialism and capitalism is far from being resolved. The overthrown landlord bourgeoisie, their hearts are not dead, they still retain an important stronghold, which is the several thousand years of ruling-class ideology and culture. They use this ideological and cultural stronghold to obstruct and sabotage the development of socialist politics and economics, doing everything they can to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. This is something we must never overlook. The owner of the "Three Family Village" black shop, Deng Tuo, did not once shout "Do not say that scholars are empty talkers, their heads are thrown where there is blood"? Those who walk the capitalist road in power, those reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, they promote capitalist and revisionist culture, spread bourgeois ideology, and create counter-revolutionary public opinion, waiting for the opportunity to launch a counter-revolutionary coup. If we do not carry out the proletarian cultural revolution, do not defeat them, and achieve a thorough victory in the socialist revolution in the ideological field, capitalism will be restored in our country, and the achievements of the socialist revolution on the economic and political fronts in our country will be in danger of being lost. Therefore, the current proletarian cultural revolution in our country is a life-and-death struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the anti-restoration of the proletariat, a major issue related to whether the socialist political system and economic base in our country can be consolidated and developed, whether they will change, and also a major issue related to the fate and future of the world revolution.

   The deepening development of the cultural revolution will inevitably promote political revolution and economic revolution, driving the development of politics and economics. Cultural revolution is always the forerunner of political revolution and economic revolution. The current proletarian cultural revolution in our country will not only fundamentally change the spiritual face of the entire society but will also greatly strengthen our proletarian dictatorship, greatly consolidate and develop our socialist system, uproot the roots of revisionism, block the road to the restoration of capitalism; and it also heralds the great development of socialist politics and economics in our country, driving our socialist construction to enter a new leap.

2. **Proletarian culture is developed in struggle. Without overthrowing the reactionary culture of the exploiting classes, proletarian new culture cannot be established.**

   Chairman Mao said: "Reactionary culture 'is something that should be overthrown. Without overthrowing this thing, no new culture can be established. Not breaking down, not stopping, not going forward is not possible; their struggle is a life-and-death struggle.' Revolution is to destroy the old world and build a new world. Towards the things of the exploiting classes, the things of revisionism, we must not adopt the method of reformism, but must adopt the method of thorough revolution. Towards class enemies, we must not rely on persuasion, but on struggle. All reactionary things, if you do not fight them, they will not fall. If you do not fight them, they will fight you. This is an inevitable law of class struggle that does not change with people's will."

   The proletarian culture in our country has been developed in the process of constantly breaking down the old and establishing the new, and struggling against various reactionary cultures. Chairman Mao said: "All new things are tempered in arduous struggles. New culture is also like this." After the May Fourth Movement, as soon as the new army of proletarian culture in our country appeared, it launched a brave attack against imperialist culture and feudal culture, making proletarian culture develop greatly. As Chairman Mao said: "The direction of this new army's advance, from thought to form (language, etc.), has brought about a great revolution. Its momentum is so great and its power so fierce that it is simply invincible." In the long-term revolutionary struggle, proletarian culture, as an important front in the revolutionary general front, has always fought fiercely against the reactionary culture of imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism. The development history of proletarian culture in our country is the history of constantly struggling and achieving victory against various reactionary cultures of the exploiting classes.

   The struggle between the proletariat and the exploiting classes on the cultural front is reflected within the Party as the struggle between the correct line represented by Chairman Mao and various opportunist lines. Among the various opportunisms, Wang Ming's opportunism had the longest period of rule within the Party and caused the greatest harm. As the manifestation of Wang Ming's "left" and right opportunism in literature, it is the bourgeois literary line represented by Zhou Yang. Our struggle against the bourgeois literary line represented by Zhou Yang started in the 1930s and continued until this proletarian cultural revolution.

   The proletarian cultural revolution is a long-term task. In the seventeen years since the founding of our country, proletarian culture and reactionary bourgeois culture have undergone a struggle that has risen and fallen. This struggle has had major battles and minor battles. The proletarian cultural revolution currently being vigorously carried out in our country is a sharp class struggle to thoroughly overthrow bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, a major battle and a general offensive against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes' ideology. Without this struggle to thoroughly overthrow and establish, the socialist revolution in our country cannot achieve a thorough victory, and the socialist system in our country cannot be consolidated and developed.

   The proletarian socialist revolution is a revolution to eliminate all exploiting classes and all exploiting systems, a revolution to gradually eliminate the differences between workers and peasants, between cities and countryside, and between mental and physical labor, the most thorough revolution. This cannot but encounter the most stubborn resistance of the exploiting classes. The landlords and bourgeoisie have been overthrown, but they have not been completely eliminated. We have confiscated the material of the exploiting classes, but we cannot confiscate their reactionary thoughts. They will inevitably, as Lenin said, with ten times the madness and a hundred times the hatred, try to restore their lost "paradise." They occupy a very small proportion of the entire population, but their resistance is much greater than their population proportion. Their ideology still has great power and influence in our country. If there is no great proletarian cultural revolution, we cannot repel their mad counterattacks, smash their restoration plots, and eliminate their reactionary ideological influence, making proletarian culture the ruling culture.

   This proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls, aiming to eliminate the poisonous old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits created by all exploiting classes over thousands of years, and to establish new proletarian thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits among the broad masses of the people, that is, to transform people's souls and achieve the ideological revolutionization of people. Without the fiery revolutionary mass struggle of thorough overthrow and establishment, this is impossible to achieve.

   The proletarian cultural revolution in our country has caused panic and chaos among imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. They maliciously curse our cultural revolution as "destroying culture." We must resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely destroy the reactionary culture of the bourgeoisie, feudal class, and revisionism, and establish a true proletarian culture that serves the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are so hostile and fearful of our cultural revolution because the thorough victory of the proletarian cultural revolution heralds the complete collapse of their dream of restoring capitalism in China, heralding the approaching end of the entire capitalist world.

   A small clique of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, in response to the mad curses of imperialism and modern revisionism, shout "establish first, overthrow later," saying that "without establishment, it is impossible to achieve a thorough overthrow." Their so-called "establish first, overthrow later" is actually not allowing the attack on the reactionary fortresses of the bourgeoisie, not allowing the overthrow of bourgeois ideology, and establishing proletarian ideology. "Establish first, overthrow later" is their great conspiracy, aiming to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and oppose the proletarian cultural revolution.

   Overthrow first, establish later, overthrow within establishment, is the dialectics of revolution. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are developed and established in the process of constantly criticizing and struggling against the bourgeois ideological system. Its basic point is to criticize, to struggle, to revolutionize. Overthrow is criticism, is revolution. Overthrow must be reasonable, and being reasonable is establishment. Overthrow is the first step, and establishment is within it. The proletarian cultural revolution is to thoroughly overthrow bourgeois ideology and thoroughly establish proletarian ideology, ultimately, as Comrade Lin Biao said: to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought. It is to let hundreds of millions of people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, use Mao Zedong Thought to change the spiritual face of the entire society, let Mao Zedong Thought, this great spiritual force, become a great material force. In the proletarian cultural revolution, we must resolutely implement Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, better learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, work hard on the word "use," further achieve ideological revolutionization, and successfully complete all the tasks given to us by the Party and the people.

3. **Revolutionary culture must be national, scientific, and popular culture.**

   In this work, Chairman Mao comprehensively, systematically, and profoundly discussed the national, scientific, and popular guidelines of revolutionary culture. This guideline is not only the fundamental guideline of new democratic culture but also the fundamental guideline of socialist culture, and it forever illuminates the road of development of proletarian culture.

   Revolutionary culture must be national culture. "It opposes imperialist oppression, advocates the dignity and independence of the Chinese nation. It is ours, bearing the characteristics of our nation." "Chinese culture should have its own form, that is, national form." Our culture, only by making it nationalized, having certain national characteristics and national forms, can it be liked and welcomed by the laboring people of our country, better serve the laboring people of our country, and contribute our strength to the new culture of the world proletariat.

   Revolutionary culture must be scientific culture. "It opposes all feudal and superstitious thoughts, advocates seeking truth from facts, advocates objective truth, and advocates the consistency of theory and practice." It is guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, opposing all the ideological and cultural poison of the exploiting classes, opposing idealism and metaphysics.

   Revolutionary culture must be popular culture. "It should serve more than ninety percent of the working and peasant masses in the entire nation and gradually become their culture." The laboring people are the masters of history and also the masters of culture. The laboring people, in the struggles of production and class struggle, have created all social wealth and human civilization. However, in the old society, the power was in the hands of the exploiting classes, and the ruling culture of the exploiting classes was completely serving the exploiting classes. Proletarian culture is truly serving the broad laboring people, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is the most fundamental difference between proletarian culture and all the cultures of the exploiting classes.

   In the socialist period, we must eliminate the old culture of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, establish and develop proletarian, socialist new culture, and seriously implement Chairman Mao's instructions on national, scientific, and popular culture.

   To eliminate all the old culture of the exploiting classes and establish and develop socialist new culture, we must thoroughly criticize the chauvinistic and backward-looking thoughts in the treatment of foreign and ancient cultural heritage. We do not reject the absorption and inheritance of Chinese and foreign cultural heritage, but we must, on the basis of thoroughly criticizing all harmful things of foreign and ancient, talk about the issues of absorption and inheritance. Absorption and inheritance must completely serve socialism, "innovate the old," and achieve "foreign for domestic use" and "ancient for modern use." Without this most fundamental premise, talking about absorption and inheritance is harmful and reactionary. Chairman Mao said: "... All foreign things, just like our attitude towards food, must be chewed and digested by our own mouth and stomach, sent into saliva, gastric juice, and intestinal juice, and divided into essence and dross, and then excrete the dross and absorb the essence, which can be beneficial to our body, and cannot be swallowed whole without criticism. The so-called 'complete Westernization' is a wrong viewpoint." Regarding the ancient Chinese cultural heritage, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Removing the feudal dross and absorbing the democratic essence is a necessary condition for the development of national new culture and the enhancement of national self-confidence; but we must not absorb indiscriminately without criticism." "We must respect our history and never cut off history. But this respect is to give history a definite scientific position, to respect the dialectical development of history, not to praise the past and criticize the present, not to praise any feudal poison. For the people and young students, the main thing is not to guide them to look back but to guide them to look forward."

   The counter-revolutionary revisionist leader of the literary and art world, Zhou Yang, enthusiastically promoted feudalist and capitalist culture, praising the culture of the European bourgeoisie of the 18th and 19th centuries as the "peak of world human culture," wanting to quickly popularize foreign bourgeois literature and art in China. He shamelessly called the bourgeois literature since the May Fourth Movement the "father," the literature of the feudal era the "grandfather," shouting to inherit the traditions of feudalism and capitalism, and to popularize these things among the masses. In the more than ten years since the founding of the country, under the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang, emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, and dead foreigners have long ruled the stage of Chinese drama. Various art forms—drama, storytelling, music, painting, dance, film, poetry, and literature—are full of feudalism and capitalism. Their fundamental purpose is to eliminate the revolutionary content of proletarian culture, making the things of the landlord bourgeoisie and revisionism flood, poisoning young people, corrupting the souls of the people, and paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, only by thoroughly criticizing the chauvinistic and backward-looking thoughts and actions of the Zhou Yang clique, can our culture better serve the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

   To eliminate the old culture of the exploiting classes and establish and develop socialist new culture, we must thoroughly criticize the revisionist fallacies in the issue of for whom the culture serves. In a class society, culture always belongs to a certain class and serves a certain class. Our culture is for more than ninety percent of the working and peasant masses in the entire population, that is, for the broad workers, peasants, and soldiers. Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the fundamental direction of proletarian revolutionary culture at any time.

   The counter-revolutionary revisionist leader of the literary and art world, Zhou Yang, openly erased the class nature of culture and sang in tune with Khrushchev, proposing the revisionist slogan of "all-people literature and art." He said that "today's literature and art should be accepted by all kinds of people," "it is for all classes to see, and it causes resonance in all people," "reflecting the interests of all people" and so on. The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang completely excluded the position of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the cultural field. They specialized in big, foreign, and ancient things, serving the landlord bourgeoisie. They did everything they could to suppress the enthusiasm of the workers, peasants, and soldiers to study Chairman Mao's works, obstructing the workers, peasants, and soldiers from directly grasping revolutionary culture. Their counter-revolutionary actions, as Chairman Mao pointed out in this book: "Their starting point is bourgeois despotism, and in culture, it is bourgeois cultural despotism.... They do not want the workers and peasants to rise politically, and they do not want the workers and peasants to rise culturally." Therefore, to develop socialist culture and insist on the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must thoroughly smash the cultural despotism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang.

   The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters of socialist culture and the main force of the proletarian cultural revolution. We workers, peasants, and soldiers use the gun to overthrow the old world and also use the pen to criticize the old world. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, directly grasp and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and become critics. This is a great event of the times. This is the great enlightenment of the people of our country, who account for one-fourth of the world's population. They have liberated their thoughts and completely stood up, no longer being the slaves of the old thoughts and old culture of the exploiting classes. The demons and monsters occupying the cultural and ideological positions have been surrounded by the vast ocean of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the so-called "experts," "scholars," "authorities," and "ancestors" of the bourgeoisie have been beaten into a miserable state, losing their prestige. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and this is the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian cultural line of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

   At present, the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in our country is very good. Every comrade must better study Chairman Mao's great work "On New Democracy," arm our minds with Chairman Mao's thoughts on the proletarian cultural revolution, and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, sweep away the dust left by the bourgeoisie in every corner, thoroughly eliminate the ideological influence of the exploiting classes that have ruled for thousands of years, create and develop proletarian new culture, consolidate and strengthen our proletarian dictatorship, and open up a new era of human history.

    学习《新民主主义论》
    《解放军报》编者按：毛主席在抗日战争时期发表的《新民主主义论》，是一部具有伟大世界意义和深远历史意义的划时代的光辉著作。
    毛主席在这部伟大著作中，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，全面地、深刻地分析了十月革命以来的世界形势和中国社会特点，总结了我国革命和世界革命的基本经验，揭示了世界无产阶级革命，特别是殖民地和半殖民地国家革命的客观规律，为我国的新民主主义革命规定了最正确、最完整的政治纲领、经济纲领和文化纲领，为一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民指明了争取新民主主义革命胜利和走向社会主义的康庄大道，极大地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。
    毛主席在这部伟大著作中，彻底清算了王明的机会主义的政治路线和文化路线，系统地、深刻地总结了我国和国际无产阶级文化革命的基本经验，提出了民族的、科学的、大众的文化这条最正确、最完整的无产阶级文化路线，为我国无产阶级文化的发展开辟了宽广的道路。
    毛主席的这部伟大著作和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》，是当代马克思列宁主义世界观和文化艺术理论的最高峰，是指导当前无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文献。我军广大干部战士，一定要联系当前革命斗争实际，深入学习这部伟大著作，用这部著作中的伟大思想武装我们的头脑，坚定地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，永远保卫我们无产阶级的铁打江山。
    为了帮助同志们学好这部伟大著作，我们编写了这个辅导材料，供连队的同志们学习参考。
    历史背景
    毛主席的《新民主主义论》，是一部具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义的经典著作。这部著作，是一九四○年一月发表的。当时，伟大的抗日战争正处在艰难的相持阶段，抗日战争形势发生了重大的变化，妥协投降的空气，反共的声浪，甚嚣尘上，“中国向何处去？”成为全国人民普遍关心的中心问题。
    一九三八年十月，日本侵略者侵占武汉、广州以后，停止了对正面战场战略性的进攻，集中主要力量疯狂地进攻我党领导的敌后抗日根据地，对蒋介石国民党则改取政治诱降的方针。英、美帝国主义为了应付德、意法西斯发动的争夺殖民地的战争，加紧了对蒋介石反动派的劝降活动，想牺牲中国来求得和日本的妥协，保存它们在华的利益，实现“东方慕尼黑”的阴谋。
    在日本诱降和英美劝降的情况下，国民党内的亲日派汪精卫公开投降了日本，英美派蒋介石则采取了消极抗战、积极反共的政策，与日本帝国主义勾勾搭搭，加紧了反共的步骤。它陆续颁布了“限制异党活动办法”等一系列的反革命文件，制造了一系列反共反人民的流血事件。一九三九年底到一九四○年初，蒋介石发动了第一次反共高潮，对我党领导的陕甘宁边区等地的抗日军民发动了疯狂的进攻，妄图消灭人民革命力量，为投降日寇扫清道路。同时，国民党反动派还开动全部宣传机器，高唱法西斯专制主义，大肆攻击共产主义，宣扬所谓“一次革命论”，胡说什么“共产主义不适合国情”，叫嚷要取消共产党、八路军、新四军以及共产党领导的一切抗日根据地，为投降日寇作舆论准备。
    在党内，以王明为代表的右倾机会主义者，反对毛泽东同志制定的正确路线，否认党在抗日民族统一战线中的领导权，反对独立自主的游击战的战略方针，主张“一切经过统一战线”、“一切服从统一战线”，实际上就是要投降蒋介石国民党。他们反对放手发动群众，反对改善工农生活，蓄意破坏工农联盟。他们反对我党创造和领导抗日革命根据地，反对在敌后放手扩大解放区和扩大人民军队，甚至主张把人民武装都交给蒋介石。以毛主席为首的党中央对王明的投降主义路线进行了坚决的斗争。但是王明错误路线的影响，还没有消除，并且在一定范围内继续损害着革命事业。
    党内的两条路线的斗争，也表现在当时的文化战线上。斗争的中心问题是以毛泽东思想作为文化的指导思想，还是以王明右倾机会主义的资产阶级、修正主义思想作为文化的指导思想。一九三六年在左翼文艺运动中发生的两个口号的争论，就是这种斗争的反映。周扬一伙，忠实地贯彻王明的阶级投降主义思想，提出了“国防文学”这个资产阶级的口号，公然抹煞阶级矛盾，背叛无产阶级利益。他们对于坚持毛主席的正确思想、提出了“民族的革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级口号的鲁迅，进行了疯狂的污蔑和攻击。在以周扬为代表的修正主义文艺路线的指导下，宣扬阶级投降的“国防戏剧”、“国防电影”，以及许多“全民”牌号的小说，充斥文坛，它们的毒素侵害着广大群众，给革命事业造成了极其严重的危害。
    在这个紧要的历史关头，中国向何处去，我们究竟要采取什么路线争取抗日战争的胜利，并进而取得民主革命的彻底胜利，就成为当时全党同志和全国人民最关心的中心问题。为了回答这个问题，毛主席发表了《新民主主义论》这部伟大的马克思列宁主义的著作。
    伟大意义
    毛主席的《新民主主义论》这部具有划时代意义的伟大著作，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，是被压迫民族和被压迫人民进行革命斗争、争取解放的指南，是无产阶级领导民主革命、走向社会主义的纲领性文件。
    毛主席在这部伟大著作中，全面、系统、深刻地总结了中国革命和世界革命的基本经验，揭示了世界无产阶级革命，特别是殖民地半殖民地国家人民革命运动的发展规律，科学地规定了新民主主义革命的政治、经济和文化纲领，指明了无产阶级革命运动的方向和道路。这部伟大著作，不仅照亮了中国革命的历史进程，指导着我国革命取得了伟大的胜利，而且为全世界一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的革命斗争，开辟了走向彻底胜利的道路。它是当代一切革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派、争取彻底解放的强大的思想武器。
    毛主席的这部伟大著作和两年以后发表的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论。它不但对王明机会主义的政治路线和文化路线作了系统的批判，对我国“五四”以来的革命文化运动的基本经验作了科学的总结，也对国际无产阶级革命文化运动的基本经验作了科学的总结。它最完整地、最全面地、最系统地总结了文化战线上的两条路线斗争。这是无产阶级革命史上第一次提出的最完整、最彻底、最正确的马克思列宁主义的文化路线。
    毛主席的《新民主主义论》和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》等光辉著作，是伟大的毛泽东思想的重要组成部分，是当代马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的最高峰，是我们文艺工作的最高准则，是无产阶级文化革命运动的纲领性文件，是当前我国无产阶级文化大革命的指南针，是消灭资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，挖掉修正主义根子，巩固无产阶级专政，发展社会主义制度的最锐利的思想武器。认真学习毛主席的这些光辉著作，掌握和运用这个最锐利的思想武器，就能攻无不克，所向披靡，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    内容大意
    这部著作，分十五节：
    第一节：中国向何处去
    妥协空气，反共声浪，忽又甚嚣尘上，中国向何处去，又成为问题了。趁着《中国文化》的出版，说明一下中国政治和中国文化的动向问题。
    第二节：我们要建立一个新中国
    我们不但要把一个政治上受压迫、经济上受剥削的中国，变为一个政治上自由和经济上繁荣的中国，而且要把一个被旧文化统治因而愚昧落后的中国，变为一个被新文化统治因而文明先进的中国。
    第三节：中国的历史特点
    一定的文化（当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予伟大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济；而经济是基础，政治则是经济的集中表现。
    中国是一个殖民地、半殖民地、半封建的社会。中国革命的历史进程，必须分为两步，第一步是民主主义的革命，第二步是社会主义的革命，这是性质不同的两个革命过程。而第一步，现在已不是旧的民主主义，而是新民主主义。
    第四节：中国革命是世界革命的一部分
    中国革命是世界革命的伟大的一部分。第一次帝国主义世界大战和第一次胜利的社会主义十月革命，改变了整个世界历史的方向，划分了整个世界历史的时代。在这种时代，任何殖民地半殖民地国家，如果发生了反对帝国主义的革命，它就不再是属于旧的世界资产阶级民主主义革命的范畴，而属于新的范畴了；它就不再是旧的资产阶级和资本主义的世界革命的一部分，而是新的世界革命，即无产阶级社会主义世界革命的一部分了。
    第五节：新民主主义的政治
    中国的民主主义革命必须由无产阶级来领导。在这一革命阶段要建立的国家，只能是在无产阶级领导下的一切反帝反封建的人们联合专政的民主共和国。它的政权构成形式，可以采取人民代表大会系统的普遍平等的选举制，即民主集中制。国体——各革命阶级联合专政。政体——民主集中制。这就是新民主主义的政治。
    第六节：新民主主义的经济
    大银行、大工业、大商业，归这个共和国的国家所有。在无产阶级领导下的新民主主义共和国的国营经济是社会主义的性质，是整个国民经济的领导力量。没收地主的土地，分配给无地和少地的农民，扫除农村中的封建关系。决不能让少数资本家少数地主“操纵国民生计”。
    第七节：驳资产阶级专政
    现在的世界，是处在革命和战争的新时代，是资本主义决然死灭和社会主义决然兴盛的时代。在这种情形下，要在中国反帝反封建胜利之后，再建立资产阶级专政的资本主义社会，完全是梦呓。处在今天的国际环境中，殖民地半殖民地的任何英雄好汉们，要就是站在帝国主义战线方面，变为世界反革命力量的一部分；要就是站在反帝国主义战线方面，变为世界革命力量的一部分，二者必居其一，其他的道路是没有的。
    第八节：驳“左”倾空谈主义
    中国革命必须分为两步走，第一步是新民主主义，第二步才是社会主义。有些恶意的宣传家，故意混淆这两个不同的革命阶段，提倡所谓“一次革命论”，用以证明什么革命都包举在三民主义里面了，起劲地反对共产主义和共产党。其目的，是想根本消灭任何革命，为投降日寇准备舆论。另外一些人似乎并无恶意，也迷惑于所谓“一次革命论”，迷惑于所谓“举政治革命与社会革命毕其功于一役”的纯主观的想头，混淆革命的步骤，也是很有害的。
    第九节：驳顽固派
    共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。这种思想体系和社会制度，是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的。资产阶级顽固派狂妄叫嚣的所谓“一个主义”，其本质就是顽固分子们的资产阶级专制主义。他们狂叫“收起”共产主义，其实，这是“收起”不得的。中国革命，没有共产主义去指导是决不能成功的。现在的世界，依靠共产主义做救星；现在的中国，也正是这样。
    第十节：旧三民主义和新三民主义
    新三民主义是联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策的三民主义，它同中国共产党在民主革命阶段中的政纲，基本上相同。旧三民主义，同共产主义的最低纲领没有什么基本上相同之点。
    第十一节：新民主主义的文化
    新文化是在观念形态上反映新政治和新经济的东西，是替新政治新经济服务的。帝国主义文化和半封建文化是替帝国主义和封建阶级服务的，它们结成文化上的反动同盟，反对中国的新文化。不把反动的旧文化打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。
    第十二节：中国文化革命的历史特点
    在中国文化战线或思想战线上，“五四”以前和“五四”以后，构成了两个不同的历史时期。在“五四”以前，中国的文化革命，是资产阶级领导的，属于世界资产阶级的资本主义的文化革命的一部分。在“五四”以后，是无产阶级的文化思想即共产主义思想领导的，属于世界无产阶级的社会主义的文化革命的一部分。新民主主义的文化，就是无产阶级领导的人民大众的反帝反封建的文化。鲁迅的方向，就是中华民族新文化的方向。
    第十三节：四个时期
    在中国，文化革命，和政治革命同样，有一个统一战线。二十年来，分为四个时期。
    第一个时期是一九一九年五四运动到一九二一年中国共产党成立的两年。这一时期中以五四运动为主要的标志。第二个时期是一九二一年到一九二七年的六年。以中国共产党的成立和五卅运动、北伐战争为标志。第三个时期是一九二七年至一九三七年的十年新的革命时期。第四个时期是从一九三七年开始的抗日战争时期。全部中国史中，五四运动以后二十年的进步，不但赛过了以前的八十年，简直赛过了以前的几千年。一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。
    第十四节：文化性质问题上的偏向
    当作国民文化的方针来说，居于指导地位的是共产主义的思想。应该扩大共产主义思想的宣传，加紧马克思列宁主义的学习，没有这种宣传和学习，不但不能引导中国革命到将来的社会主义阶段上去，而且也不能指导现时的民主革命达到胜利。新民主主义革命阶段新的国民文化的内容，既不是资产阶级的文化专制主义，又不是单纯的无产阶级的社会主义，而是以无产阶级社会主义文化思想为领导的人民大众反帝反封建的新民主主义。
    第十五节：民族的科学的大众的文化
    新民主主义的文化是民族的。它是反对帝国主义压迫，主张中华民族的尊严和独立的。它是我们这个民族的，带有我们民族的特性。新民主主义的文化是科学的。它是反对一切封建思想和迷信思想，主张实事求是，主张客观真理，主张理论和实践一致的。新民主主义的文化是大众的，因而即是民主的。它应为全民族中百分之九十以上的工农劳苦民众服务，并逐渐成为他们的文化。民族的科学的大众的文化，就是人民大众反帝反封建的文化，就是新民主主义的文化，就是中华民族的新文化。
    要着重领会的问题
    毛主席在这部光辉著作中，对中国革命的政治、经济、文化等一系列重大问题，对无产阶级的领导权问题，作了全面、系统、深刻的论述。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，我们学习这部著作，应当着重领会以下几个问题：
    一、革命的根本问题是政权问题。革命的文化是粉碎资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政的有力武器
    毛主席说：“一定的文化（当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予伟大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济；而经济是基础，政治则是经济的集中的表现。这是我们对于文化和政治、经济的关系及政治和经济的关系的基本观点。”
    一定形态的文化，是由一定形态的政治和经济决定的。在有阶级的社会里，当作观念形态的文化，是有阶级性的；它总是从属于一定阶级，从属于一定阶级的政治的。正如毛主席所说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”（《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》）一定形态的文化，在一定形态的政治和经济的基础上形成之后，又反过来积极作用于一定形态的政治和经济。这就是说，文化对于政治和经济来说，不是处于消极地位，而是具有相对的独立性和能动作用。这种作用表现在一定的文化总是为一定阶级的政治服务，为一定社会的经济基础服务，帮助和促使它们巩固和发展。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”革命的文化是团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的强大武器。革命的根本问题是政权问题。革命人民要夺取政权，当然要靠暴力，靠枪杆子，但是，如果没有革命的文化运动，没有意识形态方面的工作，没有充分的舆论准备，也是不行的。我国的新民主主义革命，就是从“五四”文化运动开始的。“五四”文化运动，为我们党的成立和党领导的革命战争，作了必要的思想准备。在长期的革命斗争中，革命的文化发挥了团结教育人民和打击敌人的重大作用，使我们在精神力量上处于压倒一切敌人的绝对优势，保证了革命斗争的胜利。这正如毛主席所说的：“‘没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动’，可见革命的文化运动对于革命的实践运动具有何等的重要性。”
    我国现在正处在伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，无产阶级的文化，是我们进行革命和建设的强大的思想武器。我们搞社会主义，有两条战线，一条是物质战线，一条是精神战线。我们必须抓住精神战线不放，以精神战线上的斗争，来带动物质战线上的斗争。因为这两条战线上的斗争，都是人的实践活动，而人总是在一定思想支配下进行实践活动的。人们思想的不同，实践的结果也就不同。有了正确的思想，才能有正确的行动。思想上打了胜仗，物质上的仗才能打胜。毛主席在《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》一文中，关于“物质可以变成精神，精神可以变成物质”的教导，高度概括了辩证唯物主义的一个伟大真理。毛主席指出：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”因此，应该大抓思想革命，大抓意识形态方面的阶级斗争，用毛泽东思想把广大群众从思想上武装起来，动员起来。广大群众的思想革命化了，就可以转化为改造社会、改造世界的巨大的物质力量，把我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业不断推向前进。
    毛主席教导我们：“文化革命是在观念形态上反映政治革命和经济革命，并为它们服务的。”建国十七年来，我国在经济战线和政治战线上的社会主义革命，取得了伟大胜利。我国的无产阶级专政和社会主义经济基础日益巩固。但是，在意识形态领域里，社会主义和资本主义之间谁战胜谁的问题，还远远没有解决。被推翻了的地主资产阶级，他们人还在，心不死，他们还保留着一个最后的重要阵地，这就是几千年来占统治地位的剥削阶级的思想文化。他们利用这个思想文化阵地，阻碍和破坏社会主义的政治、经济的发展，千方百计地为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。这是我们千万不可忽视的。“三家村”黑店掌柜邓拓，不是就曾发出过“莫谓书生空议论，头颅掷处血斑斑”的叫嚣吗？那些走资本主义道路的当权派，那些资产阶级的反动学术“权威”，他们大搞资本主义、修正主义的文化，大放资产阶级的思想毒素，就是在制造反革命舆论，等待时机，发动反革命政变。如果我们不搞无产阶级的文化大革命，不把他们打倒，取得意识形态领域里社会主义革命的彻底胜利，资本主义就会在我国复辟，我国经济战线和政治战线上社会主义革命的成果，就有丧失的危险。所以当前我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的你死我活的斗争，是关系到我国社会主义的政治制度和经济基础能不能巩固，能不能发展，会不会变质的问题，也是关系到世界革命的命运和前途的大事。
    文化革命的深入发展，必然要促进政治革命和经济革命，推动政治和经济的发展。文化革命总是政治革命、经济革命的先导。当前我国的无产阶级文化大革命，不但将从根本上改变我国整个社会的精神面貌，而且必将大大加强我们的无产阶级专政，大大巩固和发展我们的社会主义制度，挖掉修正主义的根子，堵死资本主义复辟的道路；并且预示着我国社会主义政治、经济的伟大发展，带动着我国社会主义建设出现一个新的跃进。
    二、无产阶级文化是在斗争中发展起来的。不打倒剥削阶级的反动文化，就不能建立无产阶级的新文化
    毛主席说：反动的文化“是应该被打倒的东西。不把这种东西打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争”。革命就是要破坏旧世界，建设新世界。对剥削阶级的东西，修正主义的东西，决不能采取改良主义的方法，只能采取彻底革命的办法。对待阶级敌人，不能靠劝说，而要靠斗争。凡是反动的东西，你不打，它就不倒。你不斗它，它就斗你。这是不依人们意志为转移的阶级斗争的必然规律。
    我国无产阶级文化，就是在不断地破旧立新，和各种反动文化的斗争中发展起来的。毛主席说：“一切新的东西都是从艰苦斗争中锻炼出来的。新文化也是这样”。“五四”以后，我国无产阶级文化新军一出现，就向着帝国主义文化和封建文化展开了英勇的进攻，使无产阶级的文化有了极大的发展。正如毛主席所说：“这个文化新军的锋芒所向，从思想到形式（文字等），无不起了极大的革命。其声势之浩大，威力之猛烈，简直是所向无敌的。”在长期的革命斗争中，无产阶级文化，作为革命总战线中的一条重要战线，一直同帝国主义、封建主义和资本主义的反动文化进行了激烈的斗争。我国无产阶级文化发展的历史，就是同形形色色的剥削阶级的反动文化不断斗争并取得胜利的历史。
    无产阶级同剥削阶级在文化战线上的斗争，反映在党内，就是毛主席代表的正确路线同各种机会主义路线的斗争。在各种机会主义中，王明的机会主义在党内的统治时间最长，危害也最大。作为王明的“左”右倾机会主义在文艺上的表现，是以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺路线。我们同以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺路线的斗争，从三十年代开始，一直持续到这次无产阶级文化大革命。
    无产阶级文化革命是个长期的任务。我国建国十七年来，无产阶级文化和资产阶级的反动文化就经过了时起时伏、高一阵低一阵的斗争。这中间有大战役，有小战役。当前我国正在轰轰烈烈开展的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想的尖锐的阶级斗争，是我们对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级思想发动的一次大战役、一次总攻击。没有这场大破大立的斗争，我国的社会主义革命就不能取得彻底的胜利，我国的社会主义制度就不能巩固和发展。
    无产阶级社会主义革命，是要消灭一切剥削阶级、消灭一切剥削制度的革命，是要逐步消灭工农之间、城乡之间、脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别的最彻底的革命，这不能不遇到剥削阶级最顽强的反抗。地主、资产阶级被打倒了，但是没有完全消灭。我们没收了剥削阶级的物质，但是不能没收他们的反动思想。他们必然要像列宁所说的那样，以十倍的疯狂，百倍的仇恨，企图恢复他们失去的“天堂”。他们在整个人口比例上占很少数，但是他们的反抗力量，比他们的人口比例大得多。他们的意识形态在我国还有很大的力量，很大的影响。如果没有声势浩大的无产阶级文化大革命，就不能打退他们的疯狂的反扑，就不能粉碎他们复辟的阴谋，就不能肃清他们反动的思想影响，使无产阶级的文化成为统治的文化。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，是要破除几千年来一切剥削阶级所造成的毒害人民的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，在广大人民群众中，树立崭新的无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，就是要改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化。如果没有大破大立的革命群众斗争的烈火，不来一个思想上的大革命、大震动，也是不可能实现的。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，引起了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的惊慌和混乱，它们恶毒地咒骂我们文化大革命是“摧毁文化”。我们就是要坚决、彻底、干净、全部地摧毁资产阶级、封建阶级的和修正主义的反动文化，建立起真正无产阶级的为广大工农兵群众服务的社会主义新文化。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派如此仇视和害怕我国的文化大革命，就是因为无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，预示着它们在中国实现资本主义复辟的梦想的彻底破灭，预示着整个资本主义世界更加临近了它们的末日。
    钻进党内的一小撮资产阶级代表人物，同帝国主义、现代修正主义的疯狂咒骂相呼应，他们打着“红旗”反红旗，大叫“先立后破”，说什么“没有立，就不可能达到真正彻底的破”。他们的所谓“先立后破”，实际上是不准攻打资产阶级的反动堡垒，不准破资产阶级思想，立无产阶级思想。“先立后破”是他们的一个大阴谋，目的就是要反对毛泽东思想，反对无产阶级文化大革命。
    先破后立，破中有立，是革命的辩证法。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，就是在破资产阶级思想体系的不断斗争中，建立和发展起来的。它的基本点就是要批判，要斗争，要革命。破，就是批判，就是革命。破就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。无产阶级文化大革命就是要大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，归根到底，就是林彪同志说的：要大立毛泽东思想。就是要让亿万人民掌握毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变整个社会的精神面貌，让毛泽东思想这个伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要坚决执行林彪同志的指示，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，进一步实现思想革命化，胜利地完成党和人民给予我们的一切任务。
    三、革命的文化必须是民族的科学的大众的文化
    毛主席在这部著作中，全面、系统、深刻地论述了革命文化的民族的、科学的、大众的方针。这个方针不仅是新民主主义文化的根本方针，也是社会主义文化的根本方针，它永远照耀着无产阶级文化发展的道路。
    革命的文化必须是民族的文化。“它是反对帝国主义压迫，主张中华民族的尊严和独立的。它是我们这个民族的，带有我们民族的特性。”“中国文化应有自己的形式，这就是民族形式。”我们的文化，只有搞好了民族化，具有一定的民族特性和民族形式，才能为我国劳动人民喜闻乐见，更好地为我国劳动人民服务，才能为世界无产阶级的新文化贡献自己的力量。
    革命的文化必须是科学的文化。“它是反对一切封建思想和迷信思想，主张实事求是，主张客观真理，主张理论和实践一致的。”它是以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指导的，是反对一切剥削阶级毒害人民的思想和文化的，是反对唯心主义和形而上学的。
    革命的文化必须是大众的文化。“它应为全民族中百分之九十以上的工农劳苦民众服务，并逐渐成为他们的文化。”劳动人民是历史的主人，也是文化的主人。劳动人民在生产斗争和阶级斗争中，创造了一切社会财富和人类文明。但是在旧社会，政权掌握在剥削阶级的手里，占统治地位的剥削阶级文化，完全是为剥削阶级服务的。无产阶级的文化，是真正为广大劳动人民服务的，为工农兵服务的，这是无产阶级文化同一切剥削阶级文化的最根本的区别。
    在社会主义时期，我们要破除资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧文化，建立和发展无产阶级的、社会主义的新文化，必须认真贯彻执行毛主席关于民族的科学的大众的文化的指示。
    要破除一切剥削阶级的旧文化，建立和发展社会主义的新文化，必须彻底批判在对待外国的和古代的文化遗产上的崇洋复古思想。我们并不拒绝吸收和继承中外的文化遗产，但是必须在彻底批判外国的和古代的一切有害的东西的基础上，才能谈到吸收和继承的问题。吸收和继承完全要为社会主义服务，要“推陈出新”，做到“外为中用”“古为今用”。离开这个最根本的前提，去谈吸收和继承，是有害的和反动的。毛主席说：“……一切外国的东西，如同我们对于食物一样，必须经过自己的口腔咀嚼和胃肠运动，送进唾液胃液肠液，把它分解为精华和糟粕两部分，然后排泄其糟粕，吸收其精华，才能对我们的身体有益，决不能生吞活剥地毫无批判地吸收。所谓‘全盘西化’的主张，乃是一种错误的观点。”对于中国古代的文化遗产，毛主席指出：“剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件；但是决不能无批判地兼收并蓄。”“我们必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史。但是这种尊重，是给历史以一定的科学的地位，是尊重历史的辩证法的发展，而不是颂古非今，不是赞扬任何封建的毒素。对于人民群众和青年学生，主要地不是要引导他们向后看，而是要引导他们向前看。”
    文艺界的反革命修正主义头子周扬，狂热地提倡封建主义和资本主义的文化，他把欧洲十八、十九世纪资产阶级的文化，吹捧为“世界人类文化的高峰”，要使外国资产阶级的文艺“很快在中国普及”。他无耻地称“五四”以来的资产阶级文艺是“父亲”，封建时代的文艺是“祖父”，叫嚷要继承封建主义、资本主义的传统，要把这些东西“普及到群众中去”。建国十几年来，在周扬反革命修正主义一伙的把持下，帝王将相、才子佳人、死人洋人长期统治着我国戏剧舞台，各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等充满着封建主义和资本主义的东西。他们的根本目的，就是要搞掉无产阶级文化的革命内容，使地主资产阶级和修正主义的东西大泛滥，毒害青年，腐蚀人民群众的灵魂，为资本主义复辟开辟道路。因此，只有彻底批判周扬一伙的崇洋复古的反动思想、反动行为，才能使我们的文化更好地为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务。
    要破除剥削阶级旧文化，建立和发展社会主义新文化，必须彻底批判在文化为谁服务问题上的修正主义谬论。在有阶级的社会里，文化总是属于一定的阶级，为一定的阶级服务的。我们的文化，是为占全人口百分之九十以上的工农劳苦民众，也就是为广大的工农兵服务的。为工农兵服务，任何时候都是无产阶级的革命文化的根本方向。
    文艺界反革命修正主义头子周扬，公然抹杀文化的阶级性，和赫鲁晓夫唱一个调子，提出“全民文艺”的修正主义口号。他胡说什么“今天的文艺要为各种人所接受”，“它是给所有阶级看的，引起所有人的共鸣”，“反映全体人民的利益”等等。周扬反革命修正主义一伙，在文化领域里，完全排斥了工农兵群众的地位。他们专搞大、洋、古，为地主资产阶级效劳。他们千方百计打击工农兵群众学习毛主席著作的积极性，阻碍工农兵群众直接掌握革命文化。他们这种反革命行径，正如毛主席在本书中所指出的：“他们的出发点是资产阶级专制主义，在文化上就是资产阶级的文化专制主义。……他们不愿工农在政治上抬头，也不愿工农在文化上抬头。”因此，要发展社会主义文化，坚持为工农兵服务的方向，就必须彻底粉碎周扬反革命修正主义一伙的文化专制主义。
    广大工农兵群众，是社会主义文化的主人，是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。我们工农兵用枪杆子打倒旧世界，也要用笔杆子批判旧世界。广大工农兵活学活用毛主席著作，直接掌握和运用毛泽东思想，成为批评家，这是一件划时代的大事情。这是占世界人口四分之一的我国人民的伟大觉悟，他们思想解放了，完全站立起来了，不再是剥削阶级旧思想旧文化的奴隶了。盘踞在文化思想阵地上的牛鬼蛇神，已经陷入广大工农兵群众的汪洋大海的包围之中，资产阶级的所谓“专家”、“学者”、“权威”、“祖师爷”，被打得狼狈不堪，威风扫地。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是毛主席为工农兵服务的无产阶级文化路线的伟大胜利。
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命形势好得很。我们每一个同志，在无产阶级文化大革命中，要更好地学习毛主席的《新民主主义论》这部伟大著作，用毛主席关于无产阶级文化革命的思想武装我们的头脑，坚定不移地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把资产阶级留藏在每个角落的灰尘打扫干净，把几千年来居于统治地位的剥削阶级意识形态彻底扫除，创造和发展无产阶级的新文化，巩固和加强我们的无产阶级专政，开创一个人类历史的新时代。
