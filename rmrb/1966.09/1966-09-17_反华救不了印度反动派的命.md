The Indian reactionaries, following the lead of U.S. imperialism, are going further and further down the path of anti-China. The recent dispatch by the Indian government of a so-called parliamentary delegation to Taiwan to engage in blatant collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits is the latest example of the Indian reactionaries' frenzied anti-China stance.

The Indian government has been secretly colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits for a long time. While continuing to maintain diplomatic relations with China, the Indian government has been so brazen as to disregard China's sovereignty over Taiwan and openly serve the U.S. imperialists' "two Chinas" plot. We must sternly ask the Indian government: Where do you intend to push Sino-Indian relations?

The Indian reactionaries are stepping up their anti-China activities, reflecting their increasing dependence on U.S. imperialism and their growing subservience to it in the face of internal and external difficulties. Chairman Mao, in discussing the post-war dependence of reactionaries in various countries on U.S. imperialism, pointed out: "This matter ... reflects the weakness of the reactionary forces in various countries and their psychological panic and loss of confidence, reflecting the strength of the revolutionary forces throughout the world, making the reactionaries in various countries feel that they have no way out except to rely on the aid of U.S. imperialism." However, the Indian reactionaries are already thoroughly rotten. No matter how much money U.S. imperialism gives them for their active anti-China stance, or how much support it provides, it will absolutely not save them.

### 反华救不了印度反动派的命

    反华救不了印度反动派的命
    印度反动派追随美帝国主义，在反华的道路上越走越远。印度政府最近公然派遣所谓议会代表团到台湾去，同蒋介石匪帮进行露骨的勾搭，就是印度反动派疯狂反华的一个最新的例子。
    印度政府同蒋介石匪帮明来暗去的勾搭，已经搞了很久。印度政府在同中国继续保持外交关系的情况下，竟然这样放肆地无视中国对台湾的主权，公开为美帝国主义的“两个中国”的阴谋效劳。我们要严正地责问印度政府，你们究竟打算把中印两国关系推到什么地方去？
    印度反动派加紧反华，反映了它在内外交困的情况下，更加依赖美帝国主义，更加向美帝国主义卖身投靠。毛主席在谈到战后各国反动派对于美帝国主义的依赖时指出：“这件事，……反映了各国反动派力量的薄弱及其心理的恐慌和丧失信心，反映了全世界革命力量的强大，使得各国反动派除了依靠美国帝国主义的援助，就感到毫无出路。”但是，印度反动派已经腐朽透顶。不管美帝国主义因为印度反动派积极反华而给它多少赏钱，怎样给它撑腰打气，也绝对救不了它的命。
