I have always wanted to come to Beijing to see Chairman Mao. Not long ago, I saw a picture in the newspaper of Chairman Mao swimming across the Yangtze River. His health is so good! At that time, I thought, if I could see Chairman Mao with my own eyes and shake his hand, it would be such happiness!

On the evening of September 12, my teacher told me, "You can go to Beijing with the students from Lankao County's Half-Farming Half-Studying Middle School to see Chairman Mao!" What wonderful news! I was so excited that I hardly slept all night. I told my mother, "Mom, I am going to Beijing to see Chairman Mao." My mother was overjoyed and said loudly, "You must greet Chairman Mao on my behalf!" On the train from Lankao to Beijing, I kept asking the teacher and the train attendants, "When will we get to Beijing? How many more stops are there?" I wished I could grow wings and fly to Chairman Mao's side.

Today, September 15, 1966, is a day I will never forget. I saw my beloved leader, Chairman Mao, on Tiananmen Gate. At that moment, I ran to Chairman Mao's side. Chairman Mao shook my hand, and I had so many things to say, but I couldn't say anything. I just stared at him. Suddenly, I remembered the words my mother and classmates asked me to say: "Chairman Mao, you are well!" A comrade next to him told Chairman Mao, "She is Comrade Jiao Yulu's daughter." Chairman Mao then smiled and held my hand, and together with Comrade Lin Biao, they took a photo with me. I stood close to Chairman Mao, feeling an endless source of strength! At that moment, I was the happiest person in the world! I will go back and tell my mother, my classmates, and the people of Lankao County everything about seeing Chairman Mao, so they can share my happiness.

I also saw Comrade Premier Zhou. The Premier kindly asked me, "How old are you? Which school do you attend? Is your mother in good health?" I answered his questions and conveyed greetings from my mother and classmates. He was so happy that he just kept nodding.

When I saw Comrade Jiang Qing, she said to me, "You must carry on your father's legacy!" Yes, I will follow in my father's footsteps and fight to the end.

I am a child of the new China, growing up in the era of Chairman Mao. I have not experienced the storms of revolution and did not fully understand what class struggle meant. During this Cultural Revolution, I joined the Red Guards and threw myself into the revolutionary struggle. I heard some bad people slandering socialism, saying that "Lankao County has not changed much." This made me so angry. A 70-year-old poor peasant, Grandma Wan, also got angry when she heard these words. This year, our Lankao County faced a severe drought, but under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of Lankao overcame the disaster, and the crops grew exceptionally well. Through this Cultural Revolution and the exposed facts, it is clear that class struggle still exists in socialist society, and class enemies will always oppose our socialist cause. I must keep my eyes open, distinguish between enemies and friends, and bravely join the fight. I must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be a good child of Chairman Mao. I will be tempered and improved in this Cultural Revolution, and I will serve the people wholeheartedly, like my father, and strive for communism to the end.

    让兰考人民分享我见到毛主席的幸福
    焦裕禄的女儿　焦守云
    我从小就想来北京看毛主席。不久以前，从报纸上看见毛主席横渡长江的照片，他老人家身体多么健康啊！我当时想，如果能够亲眼看看毛主席，能够握握他老人家的手，该是多么幸福！
    九月十二日晚上，学校老师告诉我：“你可以同兰考县半耕半读中学的同学一起去北京见毛主席！”多么令人高兴的消息呵，我几乎整夜没有睡成觉。我对妈妈说：“妈妈，我要到北京见毛主席了。”妈妈听了笑得合不拢嘴，大声地对我说：“你一定要代我问候毛主席老人家好！”从兰考到北京的火车上，我一路上问老师和列车员同志：“怎么还不到北京，北京还有几站呀？”我真恨不得插上翅膀，早早地飞到毛主席的身边。
    今天，一九六六年九月十五日，是我一生中永远忘不了的日子。我在天安门城楼上见到了我日夜盼望的最最敬爱的领袖毛主席。当时，我跑到毛主席身边，毛主席同我握了手，我一肚子要说的话，什么也说不出来了。我只顾看他老人家，看得发呆了。突然，我想起妈妈和同学们要我说的一句话：“毛主席，您好呵！”旁边的同志对毛主席说：“她是焦裕禄同志的女儿。”毛主席这时笑着拉住我的手，和林彪同志一起同我照了像。我紧紧地靠在毛主席身边，感到自己增添了无穷无尽的力量！这时的我呵，是全世界最幸福最幸福的人！我回去，要把见到毛主席的一切情况，详详细细地告诉妈妈，告诉同学，告诉兰考县人民，让他们分享我的幸福。
    我还见到了敬爱的周总理。总理亲切地问我：
  “你十几岁，在那个学校读书？你妈妈身体可好？”我回答了他老人家的话，并代妈妈和同学向他问好，他高兴得只是点头。
    我看见江青同志时，她对我说：“你要继承爸爸的遗志！”是的，我一定要跟着爸爸的脚印前进，革命到底。
    我是在毛泽东时代成长起来的新中国儿童，没有经历革命的风浪，过去还不大懂得什么叫阶级斗争。在这场文化大革命中，我参加了红卫兵，投到革命斗争中间来了。我听到有些坏人诬蔑社会主义，说什么“兰考县的面貌没有什么大的变化。”可把我气坏了。七十多岁的贫农社员万大娘，听了这些话也气愤地说“这些人瞎了眼”。今年，我们兰考县碰到了大旱，兰考人民在毛泽东思想指引下，战胜了旱灾，庄稼长得特别好。通过这场文化大革命，通过揭发出来的大量事实，说明了社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，而阶级敌人总是要反对我们的社会主义事业。我要擦亮眼睛，分清敌我，勇敢地投入战斗。我一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好孩子。我要在这场文化大革命中得到锻炼，得到提高，要像我爸爸那样全心全意为人民服务，为共产主义事业奋斗到底。
