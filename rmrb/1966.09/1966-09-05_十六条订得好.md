The Sixteen Points Are Well Written
Wǔ Jìmíng

The Sixteen Points are well written,
Red Guards study with enlightenment,
One struggle, two criticisms, three reforms,
Shouldering the revolutionary burden.

The Sixteen Points are well written,
Revolutionary red light shines everywhere,
Use cultural struggle, not armed struggle,
To overthrow all monsters and demons!

The Sixteen Points are well written,
The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is held high,
The Cultural Revolution has a direction,
Victory reports are flying everywhere!

    武继明
    十六条，订得好，
    红卫兵学习开心窍，
    一斗二批三改革，
    革命重担肩上挑。
    十六条，订得好，
    革命红光满天照，
    不用武斗用文斗，
    把一切牛鬼蛇神都斗倒！
    十六条，订得好，
    毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高，
    文化革命有方向，
    胜利捷报处处飘！
