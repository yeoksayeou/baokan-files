Now, revolutionary people across the nation are praising the Red Guards.

The revolutionary pioneering spirit of the Red Guards has shaken the world.

The Red Guards emerged as a new phenomenon in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and were born and grew up in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Red Guards are nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. The Red Guards say well: Chairman Mao is our red commander, we are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers.

Our Red Guards love to read Chairman Mao's books the most, love to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and love Mao Zedong Thought the most. They carry the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, regarding the study, propagation, implementation, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought as their highest duty.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the Red Guards have fought tenaciously and bravely against those in power who are taking the capitalist road and all ghosts and monsters, becoming the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the publication of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, on August 18, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao reviewed the Red Guards in the capital. Under the direct encouragement of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, the Red Guards and other revolutionary youth organizations together launched a new upsurge in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Millions of Red Guards have gone from their schools to the streets, forming an irresistible revolutionary torrent. They hold high the red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, displaying the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to pioneer, and dare to make revolution. They are cleansing the filth left over from the old society and sweeping away the garbage accumulated over thousands of years.

The Red Guards have done a lot of good deeds and put forward a lot of good initiatives. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, they have achieved brilliant results in the struggle to eliminate the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes and to establish new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat.

The Red Guards are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Their revolutionary actions have inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, leading to a more extensive and vigorous mass movement. This magnificent revolutionary mass movement has submerged a handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party into the vast ocean of the revolutionary masses. Without such a massive movement, it would be impossible to destroy the social base of a handful of rightists, to deepen, penetrate, and thoroughly carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Red Guards are a new phenomenon on the eastern horizon. Revolutionary youth symbolize the future and hope of the proletariat. Revolutionary dialectics tell us that new forces are invincible; they will grow and develop in struggle and ultimately defeat decaying forces. Therefore, we must praise and sing the praises of new things, cheer for the development of new things, and welcome new things with both hands raised high.

Our Red Guards have created immortal achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have warmly praised their sky-high revolutionary spirit, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have warmly acclaimed their revolutionary actions.

The revolutionary actions of the young revolutionaries are truly excellent! Their achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will forever be recorded in the annals of proletarian revolution.

The Red Guards have learned to swim while swimming and learned to make revolution while making revolution. They demand of themselves not only to dare to struggle and dare to make revolution but also to be good at struggling and good at making revolution. They are further studying, mastering, and implementing the "Sixteen Points" based on their practical experience.

After receiving warm praise from Chairman Mao and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the young revolutionaries have proposed to guard against arrogance and impatience, to humbly learn from the People's Liberation Army and the masses of workers and peasants. They have resolved to follow the three-eight style, three major disciplines, and eight points for attention of the People's Liberation Army to further raise their political awareness, strengthen their organizational and disciplinary consciousness. They are determined to temper themselves into revolutionary fighters like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun in the revolutionary furnace, to cultivate themselves into selfless communists, and to become successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

Different classes have different views on the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. Revolutionary classes think they are excellent, while counter-revolutionary classes think they are terrible.

Revolutionary people around the world applaud and pay high respect to the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. Imperialists, reactionaries of all countries, modern revisionists, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, however, curse the Red Guards with the most vicious language. They slander the Red Guards as "youthful hotheads," attack the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards as "violating human dignity," as "destroying social traditions," and so on.

Chairman Mao teaches us that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, defames us as utterly worthless, that would be even better. The Red Guards are vigorously opposed by domestic and foreign class enemies, which is truly an honor.

"Youthful hotheads." Revolutionary enemies always extremely hate the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and slander it as "hotheadedness." What the enemy hates is precisely what we love. The young revolutionaries must not only continue to maintain abundant revolutionary enthusiasm but also further carry forward this sky-high revolutionary spirit.

"Violating human dignity." The Red Guards mercilessly lash, expose, and criticize the reactionary and decadent culture of the bourgeoisie, exposing the ugly faces of rightist elements of the bourgeoisie in broad daylight, making them rats scurrying across the street. Thus, they cry out: "Violating human dignity." To tell the truth, we not only want to violate your "dignity" but also want to knock you down to the ground and make you never rise again.

"Destroying social traditions"? You are right. The Red Guards are indeed going to destroy the traditions of the landlord and bourgeoisie. The revolutionary young people, regarding the remnants of feudalism, the germs of capitalism, and the roots of revisionism, are going to sweep them away, exterminate them, and cut them off. Only by thoroughly destroying the various old traditions of the exploiting classes can we inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the proletariat.

According to the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the young Red Guards, concentrating their forces to strike at a handful of rightist elements of the bourgeoisie, focus on striking at those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Thus, they have uprooted the time bombs planted by imperialism and revisionism in our country. Therefore, imperialism and revisionism feel shocked, annoyed, and resentful about the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, which is very natural.

The spokesman of the reactionary class, Pope Paul VI, helplessly admits that the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are "a symbol of death, not a symbol of life" to them. Indeed, the revolutionary actions of the young revolutionaries are truly a symbol of the final doom of domestic and foreign class enemies. While our Red Guards symbolize the prosperity of the proletarian revolutionary cause, possessing boundless vitality.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is like the rising red sun in the east, illuminating the world with its brilliant radiance.

Long live the Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

    现在，全国革命人民争夸红卫兵。
    红卫兵的革命首创精神，震动了全世界。
    红卫兵是在无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨中涌现出来的新事物，是在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生和成长起来的。
    红卫兵是毛泽东思想哺育出来的。红卫兵们说得好：毛主席是我们的红司令，我们是毛主席的红小兵。
    我们的红卫兵最爱读毛主席的书，最爱听毛主席的话，最热爱毛泽东思想。他们随身带着《毛主席语录》，把学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想，作为自己最高的职责。
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵坚决同走资本主义道路的当权派，同一切牛鬼蛇神，进行了英勇顽强的斗争，成了无产阶级文化大革命的闯将。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》公布之后，八月十八日，伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，在首都检阅了红卫兵。在伟大统帅毛主席的直接鼓舞下，红卫兵和其他青少年革命组织一起，掀起了一个文化大革命的新高潮。
    千百万红卫兵由学校走上街头，形成了一股不可抗拒的革命洪流。他们高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想红旗，发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的无产阶级革命精神，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的一切污泥浊水，清扫着几千年来堆积起来的垃圾脏物。
    红卫兵干了大量的好事，提出了大量的好倡议。他们按照毛主席的教导，在破除剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，树立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯的斗争中，取得了辉煌的战果。
    红卫兵是无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋。他们的革命行动，激发了群众的革命热情，出现了更大规模的蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动。这种轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动，使钻进党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，陷入革命群众的汪洋大海之中。没有这样规模巨大的群众运动，就不能摧毁一小撮资产阶级右派的社会基础，就不能把无产阶级的文化大革命搞深，搞透，搞彻底。
    红卫兵是东方地平线上出现的新生事物。革命的青少年是无产阶级的未来和希望的象征。革命的辩证法告诉我们，新生的力量是无敌的，它一定会在斗争中获得壮大和发展，最后战胜腐朽的力量。因此，我们就是要赞美新事物，歌颂新事物，为新生事物的发展，擂鼓助威，鸣锣开道，高举双手，欢迎新事物。
    我们的红卫兵，在无产阶级文化大革命中，创建了不朽的功勋。毛主席和党中央热烈地赞扬他们的冲天革命精神，广大工农兵群众热烈欢呼他们的革命行动。
    革命小将们的革命行动，真是好得很！他们在文化大革命中的功绩，将永远载入无产阶级的革命史册。
    红卫兵们在游泳中学会游泳，在革命中学会革命。他们要求自己，不仅敢于斗争，敢于革命，而且善于斗争，善于革命。他们正在根据自己的实践经验，进一步地学习十六条，掌握十六条，进一步地贯彻执行十六条。
    革命小将们受到了毛主席和广大工农兵群众的热烈赞扬之后，他们提出戒骄戒躁，要虚心向人民解放军学习，向工农群众学习。他们下定决心，要按照人民解放军的三八作风、三大纪律和八项注意，来进一步提高自己的政治觉悟，加强组织性和纪律性。他们决心在革命熔炉里，把自己锻炼成雷锋、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊那样的革命战士，培养成为专门利人毫不利己的共产主义者，成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    对待红卫兵的革命行动，不同的阶级有不同的看法，革命的阶级认为好得很，而反革命的阶级则认为糟得很。
    全世界的革命人民为红卫兵的革命行动拍手欢呼，向红卫兵致以崇高的敬意。帝国主义，各国反动派，现代修正主义和蒋介石匪帮，则用最恶毒的语言咒骂红卫兵。他们污蔑红卫兵是“少年狂热分子”，攻击红卫兵的革命行动是“违反人类尊严”，是“破坏社会传统”，等等。
    毛主席教导我们，被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了。红卫兵受到国内外阶级敌人的起劲的反对，这真是光荣得很。
    “少年狂热分子”。革命的敌人总是极端仇视群众的革命热情，并诬之为“狂热”。敌人所恨的，正是我们所爱的。革命小将们，不仅要继续保持充沛的革命热情，并且要进一步发扬这种冲天的革命精神。
      “违反人类尊严”。红卫兵无情地鞭挞、揭露和批判资产阶级的反动腐朽的文化，把资产阶级右派分子的丑恶嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下，成为人人喊打的过街老鼠。于是他们大叫：“违反人类的尊严”。老实说，我们不仅要违反你们的“尊严”，而且要把你们打倒在地，叫你们永世不得翻身。
      “破坏社会传统”吗？你们说对了。红卫兵就是要破坏地主资产阶级的传统。革命的小将们，对于封建主义的余毒，资本主义的病菌，修正主义的祸根，就是要扫清，灭绝，斩断。只有彻底破坏了剥削阶级的种种旧传统，才能够继承和发扬无产阶级的革命传统。
    按照毛主席和党中央的指示，红卫兵小将们，集中力量打击一小撮资产阶级右派分子，重点打击党内走资本主义道路的当权派。这样，就挖掉了帝国主义、修正主义埋在我国的定时炸弹。因此，帝国主义、修正主义对红卫兵的革命行动，感到震惊、恼火和愤恨，这是很自然的。
    反动阶级的代言人罗马教皇保罗六世无可奈何地供认，红卫兵的革命行动，对他们来说“是死亡的象征，而不是生命的象征”。不错，革命小将们的革命行动，确确实实是国内外阶级敌人的最后灭亡的象征。而我们的红卫兵，则象征着无产阶级革命事业的欣欣向荣，具有无限的生命力。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，犹如东方升起的红太阳，以自己的辉煌光焰普照大地。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵万岁！
    我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！
