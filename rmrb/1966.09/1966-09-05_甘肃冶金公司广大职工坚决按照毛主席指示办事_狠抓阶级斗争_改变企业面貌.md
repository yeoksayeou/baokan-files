Only by letting Mao Zedong Thought take command and resolutely waging class struggle can the fundamental appearance of an enterprise be changed. This was the unanimous conclusion reached at a recent expanded meeting of the Gansu Metallurgical Company Party Committee.

The Gansu Metallurgical Company underwent earth-shaking changes during the socialist education movement. The revolutionary spirit of the workers was greatly unleashed, and production and construction developed rapidly. This year, it was recommended by the national industrial and transportation work conference and the political work conference as a Daqing-style enterprise. After receiving this honorable title, some people said: "The company was able to become a Daqing-style enterprise because it overfulfilled its production tasks last year." How was the title of Daqing-style enterprise obtained? Was it by overfulfilling production tasks or by Mao Zedong Thought? The comrades participating in the meeting, through a review of the changes before and after the socialist education movement, reached the correct conclusion.

They said that before the socialist education movement, the company did not act according to Mao Zedong Thought and did not wage class struggle. As a result, bourgeois ideology spread, the enterprise deviated from the socialist direction, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the worker masses was suppressed, and production was seriously affected. After the socialist education movement began in March 1963, the masses were fully mobilized, the attacks of the class enemy were repelled, the revisionist framework was broken, the bourgeois evil winds were halted, and the leadership of the enterprise was truly grasped by the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. Mao Zedong Thought took command, and the socialist direction was firmly established. As a result, the revolutionary spirit of the workers was invigorated, production continuously increased, and the output in 1965 was five times the total output of the three years before the socialist education movement. The total output of the three years after the socialist education movement was twelve times that of the previous three years, with an average of over 2,900 yuan added to the state's accumulation for every ton of metal produced. Comrades from the open-pit mine said: "Such a great change was not achieved through material incentives or administrative orders, but was the inevitable result of Mao Zedong Thought taking command and emphasizing politics. The idea that the title of Daqing-style enterprise was obtained by 'overfulfilling production tasks' is wrong. This actually puts production first and politics second."

The comrades participating in the meeting unanimously agreed that to emphasize politics, one must resolutely wage class struggle, constantly and thoroughly. If class struggle is not waged, one will forget about the enemy, easily be infiltrated by bourgeois ideology, and be unable to win in class struggle. The enterprise would then be in danger of changing color. A responsible comrade from the beneficiation plant said: Class struggle is everywhere. In our production and scientific experiments, in our personal lives, there is class struggle. He gave an example: There was a young worker from a poor peasant family in the factory. Generally, his performance was not bad. Later, influenced by bad elements in society, his thoughts changed, his lifestyle changed, and he was no longer enthusiastic about work. During the class education, we criticized various forms of bourgeois ideology. This worker, through recalling past hardships and thinking of sweet times, examined his forgetful thoughts, woke up, and his class consciousness greatly improved. He performed excellently in equipment maintenance. This incident made us realize that if the proletariat does not occupy the ideological battlefield, the bourgeoisie will inevitably occupy it. We not only have to acknowledge the existence of class struggle but more importantly, we must resolutely wage class struggle in practice; otherwise, leading the team and managing the enterprise will lose direction.

Many comrades participating in the meeting pointed out that emphasizing politics is not a one-time effort. If one thinks that after one socialist education movement or a concentrated period of political and ideological work, all problems are solved, then one is greatly mistaken. This not only cannot improve production but also risks losing the achievements of previous political work and allowing capitalist evil winds to resurface.

The process of emphasizing politics is also a process of struggle between two ideologies and two paths. To emphasize proletarian politics, one must first break away from bourgeois individualism and seriously transform one's worldview.

Comrades, through discussion, further realized that whether or not politics is emphasized depends on whether the leading cadres have a revolutionary spirit. Without a revolutionary leading core, emphasizing politics is just empty talk.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the broad masses of workers of the Gansu Metallurgical Company held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, took Mao Zedong Thought as the action guideline for the cultural revolution, and promoted production while waging revolution, further promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thoughts. The company's various tasks were done more, faster, better, and more economically, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

    甘肃冶金公司广大职工坚决按照毛主席指示办事
    狠抓阶级斗争　改变企业面貌
    据新华社兰州四日电  只有靠毛泽东思想挂帅，狠抓阶级斗争，才能从根本上改变企业的面貌，这是甘肃冶金公司党委在不久前召开的扩大会议上得出的一致结论。
    甘肃冶金公司在社会主义教育运动中发生了翻天覆地的变化，职工革命精神大发扬，生产建设大发展，今年被全国工业交通工作会议和政治工作会议推荐为大庆式企业。得到这一光荣称号之后，有人说：“公司所以能成为大庆式企业，是因为去年超额完成了生产任务。”大庆式企业的称号是怎样得来的？是靠超额完成生产任务，还是靠毛泽东思想？参加会议的同志通过回顾社会主义教育运动前后的变化，得出了正确结论。
    他们说，公司在社会主义教育运动前，不按照毛泽东思想办事，不抓阶级斗争，结果资产阶级思想泛滥，企业离开了社会主义方向，职工群众的革命积极性受到了压抑，生产受到了严重影响。一九六三年三月开展社会主义教育运动以后，充分发动了群众，打退了阶级敌人的进攻，打破了修正主义框框，煞住了资产阶级歪风，使企业的领导权真正掌握到无产阶级革命派手里，毛泽东思想挂了帅，坚定了社会主义方向。结果，职工革命精神振奋，生产节节上升，一九六五年的产量是开展社会主义教育运动前三年产量总和的五倍；社会主义教育运动后三年的产量总计，为前三年的十二倍，平均每生产一吨金属为国家增加积累二千九百多元。露天矿的同志说：“这种巨大的变化，既不是靠物质刺激，也不是靠行政命令，而是靠毛泽东思想挂帅的必然结果，是突出政治的必然结果。大庆式企业的称号是‘靠超额完成生产任务得来’的提法是错误的，这实际上是把生产放在第一位，把政治放在第二位。”
    参加会议的同志一致认为，要突出政治，就要大抓狠抓阶级斗争，要经常抓，不断抓，一抓到底。如果不抓阶级斗争，就会忘掉敌人，就容易受资产阶级思想的侵蚀，就不能在阶级斗争中打胜仗，企业就有改变颜色的危险。选矿厂党委一位负责同志说：阶级斗争处处有，在我们的生产和科学实验中，在个人的生活中都有阶级斗争。他举例说，厂里有一个贫农家庭出身的青年工人，一般表现也不错。后来，受到社会上坏分子的影响，思想变了，生活方式变了，工作也不起劲了。在阶级教育中，我们批判了形形色色的资产阶级思想。这个工人经过忆苦思甜，检查了忘本思想，醒悟过来，阶级觉悟大大提高，在设备检修中表现很出色。这件事使我们认识到，思想阵地无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然去占领。我们不仅要承认有阶级斗争，而且更要紧的是在实践中狠抓阶级斗争；不然，带队伍、办企业就要迷失方向。
    参加会议的许多同志都指出，突出政治，决不是一劳永逸的。如果认为经过一次社会主义教育运动，或集中抓一段政治思想工作，就什么问题都解决了，那就大错特错了。这不仅不能搞好生产，还有丧失前段政治工作成果，使资本主义的歪风邪气重新滋长的危险。
    突出政治的过程，也是两种思想、两条道路斗争的过程。要突出无产阶级政治，就要首先破资产阶级个人主义，认真改造世界观。
    同志们经过讨论进一步认识到，突出不突出政治，关键在于领导干部是否思想革命化。没有一个革命化的领导核心，突出政治就是一句空话。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，甘肃冶金公司的广大职工，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛泽东思想作为文化大革命的行动指南，抓革命，促生产，进一步促进人的思想革命化，公司的各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省了，获得了革命、生产的双胜利。
