Mao Zedong and the revolutionary masses are forever united in heart, and the hearts of the revolutionary masses forever belong to Mao Zedong. Those who participated in the "May 30th" struggle and the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers from the No. 2 Cotton Mill, retired worker Huang Guisheng, and his three sons—Red Guards—were deeply moved after watching "Mao Zedong and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army Together." Back home, they gathered around the portrait of Chairman Mao, enthusiastically discussing the film. Neighbors who had fought alongside Huang Guisheng against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, old workers Dai Hongkui and Lu Sanjie, also came to join the discussion.

Huang Guisheng said, "We workers have always followed Chairman Mao in revolution. We have rebelled against imperialism, attacked the warlords' headquarters, and destroyed the Kuomintang reactionaries' offices." He opened his shirt, pointing to the scar on his right shoulder, and said to his sons, "In the face of the enemy's swords, water cannons, machine guns, and armored cars, we were fearless and fought to the end. For the revolution, we were not afraid of bloodshed or beheading!" He couldn't help but sing a workers' song from those days:

	Workers,
	Everyone, stand up,
	First, establish the union,
	Then organize the patrol teams,
	United as one,
	Overthrow imperialism,
	Completely eliminate the reactionaries.

The passionate song took everyone back to the revolutionary days of the past, recalling many heroic struggles and the images of martyrs.

The remembrance of revolutionary martyrs and the joy of today's victory made Lu Sanjie shed tears of excitement. This white-haired old mother had bravely fought against imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries decades ago. Once, while distributing underground party revolutionary leaflets, she was unfortunately captured by the enemy. The enemy tortured her, demanding the names of the underground party comrades, but she remained steadfast and never revealed any information or shed a tear. In court and in prison, she stood tall, displaying the fearless spirit of a Chinese worker. After recounting these past events, Lu Sanjie said to the young people listening attentively beside her, "Seeing Chairman Mao in his cotton uniform and red armband makes me feel very close. When we were your age, we also wore red armbands—the red armbands of the workers' patrol teams—and followed Chairman Mao in revolution, rebelling against imperialism and the old society. Today, you wear the red armbands of the Red Guards, following Chairman Mao in the Cultural Revolution, rebelling against the bourgeoisie and revisionism, and defeating the ghosts and monsters, making them never able to rise again. You are right, you are doing well!"

The heroic deeds and warm teachings of the older generation deeply inspired the young people. In recent days, they have written big-character posters, exposed ghosts and monsters, gone to the streets to destroy the "Four Olds" and establish the "Four News," and grown stronger in the tide of the Cultural Revolution. Now, they have learned from the older generation the spirit of daring to rebel and daring to revolt, and have been infected with the deep class feelings of their parents' unlimited love, belief, and worship of Chairman Mao. They solemnly vowed in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. Huang Guisheng's eldest son, Huang Mulun, said, "The red base established by the older generation, we will definitely hold firmly. We will follow in the footsteps of our parents, forever following Chairman Mao in revolution. To overthrow all ghosts and monsters, even if it means facing a mountain of knives and a sea of fire, we dare to charge!"

The third son, Huang Yinniu, was very excited and spoke before his second brother, "We must learn to struggle in struggle, not only daring to rebel but also being good at rebellion. The Sixteen Points are personally presided over by Chairman Mao, and are the action guidelines for the Cultural Revolution. We must study them seriously and implement them without any compromise, overthrowing, smashing, and exposing all ghosts and monsters, and vowing to win the victory of the proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The second son, Huang Jinniu, immediately expressed the common wish of the three brothers, "Revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. We will follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and being Chairman Mao's red soldiers for life."

Recalling the past and praising the present, the two generations spoke from the heart with one voice: "Dear Chairman Mao, you are the eternal red sun in our hearts. We will follow you in revolution generation after generation, forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely advancing in storms and waves!"

    慷慨话当年　兴奋看今朝
    ——两代人纵情畅谈电影《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》
    毛主席和革命群众永远心连心，革命群众的心永远向着毛主席。曾经参加过“五卅”斗争和上海工人三次武装起义的国棉二厂退休老工人黄桂生和他的儿子——三个红卫兵小将，在看了《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》以后，激动的心情久久不能平静。回到家里，他们围聚在毛主席像前，纵情畅谈起来。住在附近的曾经和黄桂生并肩向帝国主义、国民党反动派进行过浴血斗争的老工人戴鸿奎、鲁三妹也闻讯赶来一起座谈。
    黄桂生说，我们工人一心跟着毛主席闹革命，我们造过帝国主义的反，打过军阀的司令部，摧毁过国民党反动派的衙门。他拉开衣襟，指着右肩上留下的伤痕对自己的儿子说：在敌人的大刀、水龙、机枪、装甲车面前，我们毫不畏惧，坚持打到底。为了革命，我们不怕流血，不怕砍头！说到这里，他情不自禁地唱起了当年斗争时唱的工人歌谣：
    工友们，
    大家快起来，
    先把工会立，
    再来组织纠察队，
    团结成一条心，
    打倒帝国主义，
    彻底消灭反动派。
    慷慨激昂的歌声，把人们引到了过去的革命年代，多少壮烈的斗争史实，多少烈士的英雄形象又重现在眼前。
    对革命先烈的缅怀和对今天的胜利的喜悦，使鲁三妹流下了激动的热泪。这位白发苍苍的老妈妈，几十年前曾同帝国主义和国民党反动派作过英勇顽强的斗争。有一次她在散发地下党组织的革命传单时，不幸被敌人逮捕。敌人严刑拷打她，逼迫她招出地下党组织同志的名单，但她坚贞不屈，始终没有吐露一点真情，没有掉过一滴眼泪。在法庭上、在监牢里，她正气凛然，显示出一个中国工人的大无畏的英雄气概。鲁三妹在回述这些往事以后，对坐在身旁仔细聆听着的几个年轻人说：看到毛主席穿着布军装，戴着红袖章，使我感到十分亲切。我们像你们这么大的时候，也是戴着红袖章——工人纠察队的红袖章，跟着毛主席闹革命，大造帝国主义的反，大造旧社会的反。你们今天戴上红卫兵的红袖章跟着毛主席冲锋陷阵，搞无产阶级文化大革命，大造资产阶级的反，大造修正主义的反，把牛鬼蛇神打得落花流水，永世不得翻身，你们干得对，干得好！
    老一辈的英雄斗争业绩和亲切教导，深深地激励着年轻人的心。这些日子来，他们写大字报，揪牛鬼蛇神，上街破“四旧”，立“四新”，在文化大革命的洪流中锻炼成长。现在，他们又从老一辈的身上学到了敢于革命，敢于造反的无产阶级革命精神，感染到了父辈们对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深厚阶级感情。他们满怀革命的激情在毛主席像前，发出庄严的誓言。黄桂生的大儿子黄木林说：老一辈打下的红色江山我们一定要保牢，让它千秋万代永不变色。我们要紧紧踏着父辈的足迹，永远跟着毛主席干革命，为了打倒一切牛鬼蛇神，就是刀山火海我们也敢闯！
    三儿子黄银牛心情十分激动，抢在二哥前面发言：我们要在斗争中学会斗争，不仅要敢于革命，也要善于革命。十六条是毛主席亲自主持制定的，是文化大革命的行动纲领。我们要认真学习，不折不扣地贯彻执行，把一切牛鬼蛇神斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    二儿子黄金牛紧接着说出了兄弟三人的共同心愿：干革命靠的是毛泽东思想，我们要跟毛主席干一辈子革命，就要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，一辈子做毛主席的红色小兵。
    畅叙当年事，齐声赞今朝。两代人从心底发出同一个声音：敬爱的毛主席，您是我们心中永远不落的红太阳。我们世世代代跟着您闹革命，世世代代高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在大风大浪里奋勇前进！
