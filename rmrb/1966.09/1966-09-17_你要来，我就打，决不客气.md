On September 9, two U.S. imperialist fighter jets invaded the border region of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, strafing the ground and firing rockets, injuring three of our peaceful civilians. Before this, on September 5, American bandit planes had also invaded the border region of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, dropping several bombs. This is another bloody crime committed by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people, and a serious act of war provocation.

These two acts of war provocation by U.S. imperialism followed closely after its bombing and strafing of our small cargo ship in the public waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. In just two weeks, the Johnson administration has launched repeated, frenzied air attacks on our people, which cannot but arouse the strongest indignation of the 700 million Chinese people.

The U.S. air bandits who invaded on September 9 were met with a fierce counterattack by the Chinese People's Air Force, injuring one of the enemy planes and forcing it to flee in disarray. Well done! As long as the American aggressors dare to come, we will definitely give them a sound beating.

More and more signs indicate that U.S. imperialism has decided on a policy of escalating its war of adventure. Our policy is also clear. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in our country is the best and greatest preparation for war. Listen up, American bandits, if you come, we will fight. We will show no mercy. Whether you come from the air, the sea, or the land, we will definitely break your backbone and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly annihilate the invading bandits.

We must sternly warn the Johnson administration that debts must be repaid, and the Chinese people will never let you off!

    你要来，我就打，决不客气

    九月九日，美帝国主义战斗机两架入侵我国广西壮族自治区边境地区，向地面扫射并发射火箭，打伤我和平居民三人。在这之前，九月五日也曾有美国强盗飞机入侵我国广西壮族自治区边境地区，投弹数枚。这是美帝国主义对中国人民犯下的又一血腥罪行，也是它对中国人民进行的严重的战争挑衅。
    美帝国主义的这两次战争挑衅，是紧接着它在北部湾的公海上向我小型货船进行轰炸扫射的事件之后发生的。仅仅在两个星期之内，约翰逊政府竟然连续地、疯狂地向我国人民发动空中攻击，这不能不激起七亿中国人民最强烈的愤慨。
    九月九日入侵的美国空中强盗，遭到了中国人民空军的迎头痛击，打伤了美机一架，使敌机狼狈逃窜。打得好！美国侵略强盗只要敢来，我们就一定狠狠地揍它。
    越来越多的迹象表明，美帝国主义扩大战争冒险的方针是定了的。我们的方针也是定了的。我国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，就是最大最好的备战。美国强盗听着，你要来，我就打。决不会有什么客气。不管你从空中来，海上来，还是陆上来，我们一定要打断你的脊骨，坚决、彻底、全部、干净地把入侵的强盗消灭掉。
    我们要严厉警告约翰逊政府，欠债是一定要还的，中国人民绝不会饶过你们！
