Title: Let's Be Friends Forever

I have finally completed my goal of collecting a thousand signatures in support of restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

I started collecting signatures last year. At that time, I heard an elderly Chinese woman say, "We must overthrow Japanese imperialism and American imperialism, but the Japanese people are not to blame." This woman's entire family was killed by Japanese imperialists, and she herself narrowly escaped death, enduring a long and painful nightmare under the oppression of Japanese imperialism. When I heard her words of forgiveness, it felt like something was stuck in my throat, and tears streamed down my face.

Just then, a campaign was launched in Japan to collect three million signatures in support of restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China. I immediately threw myself into this campaign with all my might. I went to factories to ask workers to sign, and to elementary schools to ask teachers to sign. While delivering goods to customers, I carried signature sheets in my pocket, collecting signatures as I went. At the same time, I exposed the "Two Chinas" deception to everyone, pointing out that American imperialism is the aggressor. Some people laughed at me, calling me a "Beijing fanatic," but this only made me more determined. China is a country armed with Mao Zedong Thought, a country without exploitation and oppression. To ensure that the people of Japan and China remain friends forever, I am determined to dedicate all my efforts.

    要世世代代友好下去
    我终于超额完成了收集一千个要求恢复日中两国邦交的签名。
    我收集签名，是从前年开始的。当时我听到一位中国老大娘说，“我们要打倒日本帝国主义和美帝国主义，但是日本人民是没有罪的。”这位老大娘的一家人全被日本帝国主义者杀害，她自己死里逃生，在日本帝国主义的欺压之下度过了恶梦似的充满痛苦的漫长年月。当我听到她的这句宽厚的话时，好像有什么东西梗塞了我的喉咙，热泪不停地流出来。
    正好这时候日本国内发起一个要求征集恢复日中两国邦交的三千万个签名的运动。我立刻全力以赴地投入到这个运动中去。我到工厂去请工人们签名，我到小学去请教师们签名。给顾客送货时，口袋里也放着签名单，一边送货、一边动员签名。同时，我还向大家揭露“两个中国”的骗局，指出美帝国主义是侵略者。有人笑我是“北京迷”，这只使我劲头更大了。中国是一个以毛泽东思想武装起来的国家，没有剥削和压迫的国家。为了让日中两国人民世世代代地友好下去，我决心献出自己的一切力量。
