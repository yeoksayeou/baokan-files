	The era of heroes breeds many heroes, and the heroic deeds compose heroic songs. “A collective Huang Jiguang, a collective Qiu Shaoyun, a collective Ouyang Hai, a collective Mai Xiande” – the 32111 Drilling Team of the Petroleum Industry Ministry has once again composed a magnificent and grand heroic song for our heroic era!

	Under the sudden attack of a towering inferno, they remained calm and fearless, with courage as vast as the sky and bravery like a tiger. They fearlessly rushed into the flames, one after another, to save the gas well. Each of them is a hero.

	In these heroes, there is a spine sturdier than steel by thousands of times; in these heroes, there is a soul of unparalleled nobility – a selfless soul, a fearless soul, a highly revolutionary soul.

	This soul shines with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. It is nurtured and forged by Mao Zedong Thought.

	Comrade Lin Biao said: Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism that transforms people’s souls. Countless facts have proven that if people truly master Mao Zedong Thought, their souls can be transformed, breaking away from the bourgeois soul and establishing a proletarian soul.

	The comrades of the 32111 Drilling Team are our shining examples. They regard studying Chairman Mao’s works as their first necessity in life, turning Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, making the execution of Chairman Mao’s instructions into conscious actions, and regarding revolutionary interests as their first priority.

	How to use the great Mao Zedong Thought to transform one’s soul? The experience of this heroic collective is: to “imprint Chairman Mao’s words in the brain, dissolve them in the blood, and implement them in actions.” This means to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao’s works, deeply remember them in the brain, and firmly put them into action; this means to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to undergo a thorough transformation; this means to completely, thoroughly, and unconditionally follow Chairman Mao’s instructions, “Do as Chairman Mao says, I will do.”

	They have genuinely done this and persisted in doing so. Therefore, they can truly master Mao Zedong Thought and transform their souls.

	Chairman Mao said: “Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created.” The heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team of the Petroleum Industry Ministry once again prove that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who have turned Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, are the most selfless, the most fearless, the strongest, and the most ingenious. They dare to climb mountains of knives and brave seas of fire, “any miracle in the world can be created!”

    革命化的灵魂
    ——赞三二一一一钻井队
    高松
    英雄时代英雄多，英雄谱出英雄歌。“集体的黄继光，集体的邱少云，集体的欧阳海，集体的麦贤得”——石油部32111钻井队，又为我们这个英雄的时代谱出了一曲雄伟壮丽的英雄歌！
    在一场冲天大火的突然袭击下，他们面不改色心不跳，胆如天大勇似虎，舍生忘死闯火海，前赴后继救气井。他们个个是英雄。
    在这些英雄身上，有一副比钢铁还要硬千百倍的硬骨头；在这些英雄身上，有一个无比高尚的灵魂——无私的灵魂，无畏的灵魂，非常革命化的灵魂。
    这个灵魂闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。它是由毛泽东思想哺育起来和铸造成功的。
    林彪同志说：毛泽东思想是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义。无数事实证明，人们如果真正把毛泽东思想学到了手，他们的灵魂就能得到改造，破资产阶级的灵魂，立无产阶级的灵魂。
    32111钻井队的同志们是我们光辉的榜样。他们把读毛主席的书当作生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动，把革命的利益当成自己的第一生命。
    怎样用伟大的毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂呢？这个英雄集体的经验是：要把毛主席的话，“印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”这就是说，要活学活用毛主席著作，深深地记在脑子里，狠狠地用在行动上；这就是说，要以毛泽东思想为武器，对自己进行脱胎换骨的改造；这就是说，要完全、彻底、不折不扣地照毛主席的指示办事，“毛主席怎么说，我就怎么做”。他们切切实实地这样做了，而且坚持做下去，那么就能把毛泽东思想真正学到手，就能把自己的灵魂改造好。
    毛主席说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”石油部32111钻井队的英雄事迹，再一次证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，把毛泽东思想化为自己灵魂的人，最无私，最无畏，最坚强，最机智，刀山敢上，火海能闯，“什么人间奇迹也可以造出来”！
