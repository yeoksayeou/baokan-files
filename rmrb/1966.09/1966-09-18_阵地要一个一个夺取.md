I enlisted in 1959 and became a tank soldier right away. However, my education was limited, with only a primary school background, making it very difficult for me to learn the technical skills. I remember one day when an older comrade took me to see a tank. I was bewildered by the sight of all the wires, gauges, switches, and oil pipes. The more I looked, the more confused I became and the less confident I felt. The political instructor noticed my thoughts and said to me, "Don't be afraid. Chairman Mao teaches us that strategically we must despise the enemy, but tactically we must take them seriously. As long as we dare to do it, we will definitely succeed."

At first, I tried to learn everything at once, but the results were poor. I then turned to studying Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "In the deployment of a campaign, we must oppose the erroneous method of war of lightly regarding the enemy and thus dividing our forces to deal with the enemy on all fronts, with the result that we cannot annihilate the enemy on any one front and place ourselves in a passive position." I thought: fighting is like this, and so is studying and working. I decided to focus on mastering the theoretical aspects of the technology. However, the theory was very deep, and I didn't know where to start. I opened Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said, "If our forces are insufficient, we should take the enemy's occupied cities one by one, and not attack several towns of the enemy at the same time." Cities must be taken one by one, and theoretical knowledge must be mastered bit by bit, not rushed.

So, I adjusted my study methods accordingly. Step by step, from shallow to deep, I gradually mastered the theoretical knowledge. When learning to drive and operate, I also adopted the method of taking one step at a time, first tackling the weakest links. I focused on practicing the coordination of hands and feet, and the results were significant. On this basis, I continued to expand my achievements and conducted actual vehicle driving. Originally, driving in the vehicle was very different from practicing on the ground. Actions that were very familiar on the ground became chaotic once in the vehicle. "When the situation changes, the method of fighting must also change." Based on the actual driving conditions, on flat terrain, I focused on shifting gears; on winding roads, I focused on controlling the direction; on uneven terrain, I focused on controlling the throttle. In this way, I concentrated on breaking through one difficulty at a time, practiced continuously, and the driving effect became better and better. Chairman Mao's thoughts armed my mind, helping me gradually learn some technical skills. In 1962, I became a driving technician and was rated as an excellent tank driver by the Shenyang Military Region leadership.

In the future, I will use Chairman Mao's thoughts to train soldiers, making our minds red and our skills sharp. If any enemy dares to invade, we will eat them up bit by bit and eliminate them part by part, striving tirelessly to liberate all of humanity!

    阵地要一个一个夺取
    解放军某部副连长　李树春
    我是一九五九年入伍的，到部队就当上了坦克兵。可我的文化很低，只有初小文化程度，学技术有很多的困难。记得有一天老同志领我去看坦克，我一看就懵了，什么电线、仪表、开关、油管等等，越看越糊涂，越看越缺乏信心。指导员看出了我的心思，对我说：不要怕，毛主席不是教导我们吗，在战略上要藐视敌人，在战术上要重视敌人。只要是“敢”字当头，就一定能学好。
    开始，我在学习上贪多求全，效果不好。我就学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“在战役部署上，必须反对那种轻视敌人、因而平分兵力对付诸路之敌、以致一路也不能歼灭、使自己陷于被动地位的错误的作战方法。”我想：打仗是这样，学习和工作也是这样，我就选中技术理论课为主攻对象。但是理论很深，简直不知道从哪里学起。我又翻开毛主席著作，毛主席说：“如果我军兵力不足，则应对敌军所占诸城一个一个地夺取之，而不要同时攻击几个城镇的敌人。”城市要一个一个地夺取，技术理论也要一点一滴地攻下，不能急于求成。因此，在学习方法上又作了相应的改变。就这样，一步一步地由浅入深地掌握了理论知识。学习驾驶操作时，也是采取一步一个脚印，先攻薄弱环节的办法，抓住了手脚配合这个动作狠狠练起来，结果效果就是显著，在此基础上，我就继续扩大战果，进行实车驾驶。原来车上驾驶与车下练习很不一样，在地上练的很熟的动作，一到车上，开动起来，就手忙脚乱。“情况改变了，作战方法也应改变”。根据实车驾驶的情况，在平坦地形上，我就以变速为重点，在拐弯抹角的地形上，我就以掌握方向为重点，在高低不平的地形上，我就以掌握油门为主。这样，一个时期集中精力突破一个难点，不断练习，驾驶效果越来越好。毛主席思想武装了我的头脑，帮助我逐步学会一些技术。一九六二年我当上了驾驶技师，并被沈阳部队领导机关评为坦克驾驶能手。
    今后，我更要用毛主席的思想去练兵，把思想练红，把技术练精。任何敌人胆敢来犯，我们就一口一口把它吃掉，一部分一部分地把它消灭，为解放全人类而作出不懈努力！
