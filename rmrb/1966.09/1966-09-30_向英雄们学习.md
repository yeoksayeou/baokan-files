To all comrades of the Heroic Drilling Team:

After listening to your heroic deeds on the radio, we are filled with excitement and immense emotion. The sun and rain nurture the pine tree, and Mao Zedong Thought nurtures heroes. You are heroes of the proletarian revolution nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. For the sake of rescuing state property and building socialism, you have fearlessly faced death. You are truly noble, pure, moral, free from vulgar interests, and beneficial to the people.

We are determined to learn from you: to learn from your spirit of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to strive hard in practice, to arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and to make our thinking revolutionary; to learn from your fearlessness of hardship and death, your dedication to the revolution and the people, and your complete, thorough devotion to the people. We will definitely follow in the footsteps of the heroes and enthusiastically respond to the great call of the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao to "pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." We will grasp the direction of the struggle and fight to the end the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to expose, overthrow, and defeat them.

All revolutionary cadres of the county committee of Muyu, Xinjiang

    向英雄们学习三二一一一英雄钻井队全体同志：
    从广播里收听到你们的英雄事迹后，我们热血沸腾，万分激动。阳光雨露育青松，毛泽东思想哺英雄。你们是毛泽东思想哺育出的无产阶级革命英雄。你们为了抢救国家财产，为了建设社会主义，把生死置之度外。你们真正是高尚的人，纯粹的人，有道德的人，脱离低级趣味的人，有益于人民的人。
    我们决心向你们学习，学习你们活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，使自己思想革命化的精神；学习你们一不怕苦，二不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民，完全、彻底为人民服务的崇高品质。我们一定踏着英雄的足迹，最热烈地响应伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席关于“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，掌握斗争的大方向，把一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派斗臭、斗垮、斗倒。
