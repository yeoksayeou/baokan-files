We are flight attendants of China's civil aviation, soaring through the skies of our country and the world, living in an ocean of international friendship. Every day, we witness moving events around us that we can never forget.

During our flights, whenever we read Chairman Mao's quotations in the cabin, both Chinese and foreign passengers applaud enthusiastically and spontaneously sing revolutionary songs like "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." Many foreign passengers stand up excitedly, clapping and singing, some directing, others playing the harmonica for accompaniment. The songs blend the feelings of friends from many countries, and many people's eyes well up with tears of excitement. Often, foreign friends ask us to write down the lyrics for them. A Latin American passenger excitedly said, "The Chinese people rely on Mao Zedong Thought to make revolution," and we too will rely on Mao Zedong Thought to make revolution. All the people of the world will rely on Mao Zedong Thought to make revolution.

Such incidents happen countless times in our daily lives. We increasingly feel the deep love of revolutionary people around the world for the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, and their boundless admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao. Friends from the five continents break through numerous obstacles to come to China, seeking revolutionary truth. Even in a short flight, they seize the time to eagerly read Chairman Mao's works, drawing from the experiences of the Chinese revolution.

Many foreign friends, when boarding the plane to leave our country, always seem reluctant to part. An African friend said, "We really don't want to leave you, but we have to fight, we have to work, we must go back. We are bringing back Chairman Mao's books from China, which are the most precious gifts our comrades have been longing for day and night. These books will become powerful weapons in our struggle against imperialism."

The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists claim that "China is isolated," which is completely false. From the numerous facts we encounter daily, we feel that the broad revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America love New China and Chairman Mao. The American people and the Soviet people also share the same feelings. In July, an American friend took our plane to Beijing. He said to us, "I love New China and have been longing to come to Beijing to see our common leader Chairman Mao Zedong. Today, my wish is about to be fulfilled, and my joy is indescribable." Soviet passengers on our planes often give us a thumbs up and quietly say, "Mao Zedong!" Their words and glances all reveal the deep love for Chairman Mao hidden in their hearts.

Chairman Mao said, "Our friends are everywhere in the world." This is absolutely true. China is the base of world revolution, Beijing is the world's Yan'an, and the eyes of revolutionary people around the world are on us. As flight attendants of China, we feel incredibly fortunate and honored. We increasingly recognize the great global significance of the Chinese revolution. We must carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end, defend our ironclad mountains and rivers, keep China forever red, and forever make it a solid base for the world revolution. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and contribute all our strength to the world revolution.

    世界革命人民心向北京
    我们是中国民航的乘务员，常年飞翔在祖国和世界的万里长空，生活在国际友谊的海洋中。每天，在我们身边都发生一些令人感动的事情，使我们永远不能忘怀。
    在航行途中，每当我们在机舱中朗读完毛主席语录的时候，中外乘客都热烈鼓掌，并情不自禁地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲。许多外国旅客激动地站起来，边拍手边唱，有的出来指挥，有的吹口琴伴奏。歌声把来自许多国家的朋友的感情溶合在一起，多少人眼里含着兴奋的泪花。常有一些外国朋友要我们把歌词写给他们。有一位拉丁美洲的客人兴奋地说，中国人民“干革命靠的是毛泽东思想”，我们也要靠毛泽东思想干革命，全世界人民都要靠毛泽东思想干革命。
    这样的事情，在我们日常生活中，不知有多少。我们越来越强烈地感受到世界革命人民对中国共产党和中国人民的无比热爱，对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限敬仰。五大洲的朋友，冲破重重阻挠，来到中国，寻求革命真理。即使在短短的一段飞行途中，他们也抓紧时间，如饥似渴地阅读毛主席著作，汲取中国革命的经验。
    许多外国朋友在乘飞机要离开我国的时候，总是依依不舍。一位非洲朋友说：“我们真舍不得离开你们，但是我们要斗争，要工作，我们必须回去。我们从中国带回了毛主席的书，这是我们的战友日夜渴望的最宝贵的礼物。这些书，将成为我们反对帝国主义斗争的强有力的武器。”
    美帝和苏修胡说什么“中国孤立了”，这完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话。我们从自己日常接触到的大量事实中感觉到，亚非拉的广大革命人民热爱新中国，热爱毛主席。美国人民和苏联人民，也是怀着同样的感情。今年七月间，一位美国朋友乘我们的飞机来北京。他对我们说：“我热爱新中国，日夜盼望着能够到北京看望我们共同的领袖毛泽东主席。今天，我的愿望快要实现了，我内心的高兴是无法形容的。”乘坐我们飞机的苏联旅客，也常常有些人，竖起大拇指，悄悄地对我们叫一声“毛泽东！”这些人的一句话，一个眼色，都流露出蕴藏在他们内心深处的无限热爱毛主席的强烈感情。
    毛主席说：“我们的朋友遍于全世界。”这是千真万确的。中国是世界革命的根据地，北京是世界的延安，世界革命人民的眼睛都望着我们。作为中国的乘务员，我们感到无比幸福，无上光荣。我们更加认识到中国革命的伟大世界意义。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保卫我们铁打的江山，使中国永远保持鲜红的颜色，永远成为世界革命的巩固根据地。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，加强无产阶级国际主义精神，为世界革命贡献出我们的全部力量。
