Chairman Mao once again receives a million revolutionary youngsters, further inspiring the revolutionary spirit of the nation's military and civilians
Millions of revolutionary masses cheer the ever-improving situation of the Cultural Revolution
The broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary students and teachers express: We will resolutely follow the Sixteen Points, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, aim accurately, and strike hard. We will concentrate our forces to bombard a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road; we will take up both revolution and production, ensuring victory in both the cultural revolution and production.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 16th, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, on the 15th, once again received a million revolutionary youngsters in the capital, providing immense inspiration and fighting spirit to the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres across the country. The joyous news spread, and the entire nation was in high spirits. People of all nationalities, with the happiest and most heroic feelings, pledged to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee: We will resolutely carry out and implement the Sixteen Points formulated under the leadership of Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and in the ever-improving revolutionary situation, continue to strive forward, seize new victories, and welcome the new high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution and socialist construction, achieving new victories in the cultural revolution and production.

This morning, after the radio broadcast the live recording of yesterday's rally in Tiananmen Square, many cities were filled with cheers. People sang and danced, held meetings and parades, creating a festive atmosphere. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary students and teachers also held discussions. They excitedly said: Our great leader, great teacher, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, in less than a month, has received the Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers from the capital and across the country three times. This is the greatest care and encouragement for us revolutionary masses. They said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our country's proletarian cultural revolution is surging forward, wave upon wave. The situation is getting better and better. This is a major victory achieved by firmly grasping the direction of the struggle according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in his speech: Bombarding the headquarters means bombarding a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road. We must ensure that our "cannons are aimed correctly, our targets are precise, and we strike hard." In the struggle, we must better learn and apply the Sixteen Points to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

In the cultural revolution, the workers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Harbin, Changchun, Wuhan, Nanning, Urumqi, Xining, and Yinchuan, who bear the glorious and arduous tasks, were inspired by the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of the revolutionary youngsters. In their discussions and pledges, they enthusiastically expressed: We will definitely, under the banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, take the Sixteen Points as the guideline, take up both revolution and production, and be the main force in revolution and construction. We will firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and move from victory to victory!

The broad masses of workers and peasants in Beijing held discussions and seriously studied the speeches of Comrades Lin Biao and Zhou Enlai. They expressed that Chairman Mao's reception of a million revolutionary youngsters is also a reception of the revolutionary masses in Beijing and across the country. We will definitely not disappoint Chairman Mao's trust and expectations. Yang Fuzhen, a model worker in studying Chairman Mao's works from the No. 1 Cotton Mill in Shanghai, and Qi Zhixiao, the leader of the Honglei Youth Group from the Shanghai Synthetic Fiber Research Institute, passionately expressed that our goals and the direction of the struggle are completely consistent with those of the revolutionary students and teachers. We workers fully support them and will definitely unite closely with them and fight shoulder to shoulder under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao to push the proletarian cultural revolution to new heights. Old worker Lu Canrui from the Shenyang Smelting Plant, after hearing the live broadcast of the Tiananmen Square rally, happily said, "The situation of the cultural revolution is indeed very good. We workers must closely follow Chairman Mao, unite with revolutionary students, grasp the direction of the struggle, direct our spears at those in power who are taking the capitalist road, be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage plots, and achieve greater victories in revolution and production."

The joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of the revolutionary youngsters spread to the countryside, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants eagerly shared the news and expressed their determination to support the revolutionary youngsters in making the revolution and achieving a bumper harvest in agricultural production. Representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants from Zhengzhou, Yan Liancheng and Zhao Qiucheng, excitedly expressed: Chairman Mao personally leads this cultural revolution, and the Red Guards are the vanguard of the revolution. They follow Chairman Mao's instructions and have always advanced in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support them. We poor and lower-middle peasants will resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take up both revolution and production, achieve a bumper harvest in agricultural production, and achieve new victories in the revolution. Old member of the Red Guards from Jinggangshan in Jiangxi, Xie Huifu, praised the revolutionary youngsters in a discussion, saying: "Seeing the revolutionary successors educated by Chairman Mao so full of vigor and fearlessness, I am truly happy from the bottom of my heart. We old members of the Red Guards will firmly support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, sweep away all ghosts and snakes, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly over all of China and the world!"

Revolutionary students and teachers across the country were particularly excited to hear the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of the revolutionary youngsters. Revolutionary students and teachers in Nanjing, Guiyang, Xi'an, Tianjin, Kunming, Changsha, Hefei, and Lhasa held meetings or celebratory parades to express their determination to carry the cultural revolution through to the end to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Revolutionary students and teachers in Xi'an celebrated the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of the Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers, and the fact that they had received the precious book "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume IV, as a double blessing. Miao student Yang Chaozhong from the Yunnan Nationalities Institute said: Chairman Mao has liberated us from the sea of suffering. We have deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. We will definitely strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points, grasp the direction of the struggle, always believe in the Party, believe in the masses, learn from the advanced experiences of other places, and carry out the cultural revolution in depth in our region. Red Guards from Daqing, who were in Beijing exchanging revolutionary fighting experiences, saw Chairman Mao yesterday in front of Tiananmen. They immediately telephoned back to Daqing in the middle of the night to share this happiest scene and the call issued by Comrade Lin Biao on behalf of Chairman Mao. Today, the campus of Lhasa Middle School echoed with shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" and the song "The East Is Red." Red Guard Xia Cendenyi said: Chairman Mao's reception of the Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers again fills us with boiling blood. Ten thousand words cannot express our gratitude to the great leader. Although we are in the highlands, our hearts have already flown to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will forever follow you and grow in the great storms of revolution.

The revolutionary youngsters, in their pledges, big-character posters, and discussions, unanimously expressed: We will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn the revolutionary qualities of workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn to revolutionize in the revolution, and temper ourselves into a new generation of communists in the great storms of struggle. The revolutionary youngsters of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Institute said: The masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the cultural revolution and the iron wall of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must learn their most thorough revolutionary spirit, learn their daring to revolutionize and dare to struggle, and be good at revolutionizing and struggling. We must, like workers, peasants, and soldiers, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. Revolutionary students and teachers of Dongfanghong Middle School in Lanzhou were extremely excited after hearing the news and immediately organized hundreds of people to support the autumn harvest in the suburban people's communes. Revolutionary students from Fuzhou University, who had just returned from Beijing, were particularly excited when they heard the broadcast. Some students said: Beijing is full of revolutionary spirit, and we must bring back the "dare" spirit of the revolutionary students in the capital. Others added: We must also bring back the "good" spirit, dare to struggle and be good at struggling. They said that the most important thing is to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points. With Mao Zedong Thought, the direction is the same, and we will definitely carry the proletarian cultural revolution in depth.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 16th, the joyous news of our great leader, great teacher, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao's reception of a million Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers from across the country and the capital spread like spring breeze through the barracks and battlefields of the People's Liberation Army. The broad masses of officers and soldiers were in high spirits, cheering and expressing their deep affection for the great leader Chairman Mao:

Chairman Mao receives the Red Guards again, the five continents and four seas are in joy; following the leader to make the revolution, all obstacles are swept away!
Chairman Mao ascends Tiananmen, a red sun rises in the east; ten thousand words cannot express, Chairman Mao's heart is connected with ours!

The officers and soldiers unanimously expressed: Under the wise leadership and command of the great commander Chairman Mao, we will definitely unite closely with the Red Guard youngsters and revolutionary students and teachers, take the Sixteen Points as our weapon, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, not resting until we achieve complete victory.

The officers and soldiers of the armored troops of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region immediately picked up their pens to write their thoughts, poems, and wall newspapers to express their boundless love for Chairman Mao.

The officers and soldiers of a certain gunboat of the Navy, who were on patrol at sea, heard the joyous news and happily took out "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from their pockets, held them high, and waved them, singing "The Boat Sails on the Sea Guided by the Helmsman" and breaking through the waves forward. Representatives attending the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Wuhan Military Region immediately held a discussion after listening to the broadcast. The representatives excitedly said that although we are far from the capital, we feel as if we are standing on Tiananmen Square, seeing Chairman Mao together with the Red Guard youngsters and revolutionary students and teachers. Chairman Mao's heart is tightly connected with ours. Revolutionary students and teachers of a certain infantry school said that the ten thousand revolutionary students and teachers of our military academies, together with the Red Guard youngsters, accepted the inspection of the great commander Chairman Mao. This is Chairman Mao's greatest care and trust for the broad masses of officers and soldiers in our army. We feel the greatest honor and happiness. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, reform education, and make our military academies into the most advanced, revolutionary, and progressive schools in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

The officers and soldiers expressed in their discussions that they unanimously cheer the ever-improving situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in our country.
