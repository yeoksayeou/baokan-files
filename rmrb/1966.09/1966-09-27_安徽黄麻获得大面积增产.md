Anhui, a new hemp-producing region in China, has achieved a large-scale increase in hemp production this year. Currently, farmers in the hemp-producing areas are busy harvesting and eagerly selling their crops to support the state.

This province began trial cultivation of hemp in 1964. This year, the hemp planting area has expanded by 2.1 times compared to last year. Due to meticulous management, the yield has significantly increased. In the key production area of Yingzhou County, over 90,000 mu (approximately 6,000 hectares) of hemp has an average yield of about 800 jin (approximately 400 kilograms) per mu.

    安徽黄麻获得大面积增产
    我国黄麻新产区安徽省，今年种植的黄麻获得大面积增产。目前，产麻地区的社员正在加紧收割，踊跃出售，支援国家。
    这个省是一九六四年才开始试种黄麻的。今年，黄麻种植面积比去年扩大二点一倍。由于管理精细，产量大幅度提高，重点产区颍上县九万多亩黄麻，平均单产达八百斤左右。
