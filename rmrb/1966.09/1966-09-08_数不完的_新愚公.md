The poor and lower-middle-class peasants of our village, Da Cui Jia Zhuang, love to read Chairman Mao's books and listen to his words the most. We understand that only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought can have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes, fearing neither heaven nor earth, and can unleash the greatest power to create miracles on earth.

Our village of Da Cui Jia Zhuang started by studying Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind. We are located in the northernmost mountainous region of Meixian County. In the past, because we did not seriously study Chairman Mao's works, our minds were not liberated, and production did not improve. For more than twenty years since liberation, we have been lagging behind every year and have had to rely on the state for grain supplies. Since last October, the party branch has insisted on prioritizing politics and called for the intensive study of Chairman Mao's works. This has made everyone stand taller and see farther, and has invigorated the revolutionary spirit. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle-class peasants proposed to carve out an eighteen-mile-long spiral mountain canal on the steep cliffs, diverting the water of the Hutuo River to the high mountains, achieving full land irrigation, and fundamentally changing the poor mountain landscape to support national construction and the world revolution of the people.

After the problem was raised, at the beginning, a few people were frightened. They said, "This canal, the project is large, the cost is high, if the state does not support us, relying on just our small village, a hundred or so laborers, it is impossible to accomplish." In response to these thoughts, we organized everyone to study with questions in mind the articles "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Who Says Chickens Cannot Fly to the Sky." Chairman Mao's books are truly like a beacon; once studied, everyone's hearts became enlightened.

The entire brigade of community members joined forces, with over a hundred laborers all participating, and with one breath, in just twenty-seven days, they completed the fifteen-mile-long canal that was originally planned to be finished in a year. When the project reached the peak of the cliff, the difficulties increased. For over three miles, it was all a hundred-meter-high cliff. Below, the Hutuo River water roared like a hungry lion. On the sheer cliff, not only could people not stand there to dig the canal, but even birds and beasts had no place to rest. Who could risk their lives to dig the canal on the cliff? We still turned to Chairman Mao's books for guidance and organized everyone to study with questions in mind "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune." After studying, everyone's minds were liberated. The fifty-seven-year-old Communist Party member, Comrade Cui Mingzhe, and his three sons, the next morning, took Chairman Mao's works, food, and ropes to the top of the cliff. Old Cui had his three sons lower him down the cliff to work. The cliff was steep and slippery with ice, and there was no place to stand. Old Cui simply took off his shoes and socks and started working. Following Comrade Cui Mingzhe's lead, more than twenty young people eagerly volunteered to form a shock brigade, launching the battle to cut through the cliff and dig the canal, pushing the project to a new height.

Chairman Mao's books mobilized the entire village. The old poor peasant, Comrade Liang Wuming, because of a leg problem, could not climb the mountain, so he went alone to the Longye Gorge, three miles away from the village, to block the stream. In one winter, he blocked three small streams, turning fifteen acres of dry land into irrigated land. Everyone praised him, and he smiled and said, "Chairman Mao said, a person's ability has its limits, I may not be able to go up the mountain to dig the canal, but I can do other things. Whatever I do is for the people, what is there to praise!"

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, there are countless such "new Yu Gong" in our village of Da Cui Jia Zhuang. It is these new people armed with Mao Zedong Thought that, in just five months, on this cliff, completed the eighteen-mile-long spiral mountain canal that was originally planned to be finished in three years, fully achieving land irrigation!

    数不完的“新愚公”
    山西省盂县御枣口公社  大崔家庄大队党支部书记  崔昌进
    我们大崔家庄的贫下中农，最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话。我们懂得，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才能心最红，眼最亮，天不怕，地不怕，才能发挥最大的威力，才能创造人间奇迹。
    我们大崔家庄就是靠带着问题学习毛主席著作起家的。我们处在盂县最北的山石地区，过去由于没有认真学习毛主席著作，思想不解放，生产上不去。解放二十多年来，年年落后，年年向国家要供应粮。去年十月份以来，党支部坚持突出政治，号召大学毛主席著作。这就使大家站得高了，看得远了，振奋了革命精神。广大的贫下中农提出要在悬崖峭壁上，开凿一条十八里长的盘山大渠，把滹沱河水引上高山，实现全部土地水利化，彻底改变穷山面貌，支援国家建设和世界人民革命。
    问题提出来后，一开始，也有少数人被吓住了。他们说：“这条渠，工程大，花费多，国家要是不给支援，单靠咱这小村子，百十个劳力，万万搞不成。”针对这些思想，我们组织大家带着问题学习了《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》、《谁说鸡毛不能上天》等文章。毛主席的书真是比灯明，一学大家的心就亮了。
    全大队社员齐心合力，一百多个劳力全部上阵，一鼓作气，只二十七天时间，就开出了原来计划一年才能完工的十五华里长的水渠。工程到了峰崖湾，困难更大了，三里多长全是一百米高的悬崖峭壁，下面的滹沱河水像一只饿狮在吼叫。笔直的半崖上，别说让人站在那里开渠，就是飞禽走兽也没有个停足的地方，谁能冒着生命的危险下崖开渠呢？我们还是向毛主席的书请教，组织大家再次带着问题学习《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》。经过学习，大家的思想解放了。五十七岁的共产党员崔明哲同志和他的三个儿子，第二天一早，就带上毛主席著作、干粮、绳索上了峰崖顶。老崔让三个儿子把他吊在半崖上工作。崖直石滑又有冰霜，蹬不住脚，老崔就干脆脱掉鞋袜干起来。在崔明哲同志的带动下，二十多个青年争先恐后地报名组成突击队，展开了斩崖开渠的战斗，把工程推向一个新的高潮。
    毛主席的书把全村人全都动员起来了。老贫农梁无名同志因为腿上有毛病，不能爬山，他就一个人跑到离村三里外的龙页沟去闸溪水，一冬天就闸住三条小溪，把十五亩旱地变成了水地。大伙表扬他，他笑着说：“毛主席说，一个人能力有大小，我虽不能上山开渠，可是能干别的营生，干了什么都是为人民服务，有什么好表扬的！”
    在毛泽东思想的指导下，像这样的“新愚公”，在我们大崔家庄真是数不完。我们就是依靠这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的新人，仅仅用了五个月的时间，在这条悬崖峭壁上，开成了原计划三年才能完成的十八里长的盘山大渠，彻底实现了全部土地水利化！
