People armed with Mao Zedong Thought dare to scale the heights of science and technology. Daqing achieves new world level in drilling technology.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 13th, people of Daqing, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ascended to new heights never before reached by anyone. The model unit of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the 1202 and 1205 drilling teams of Daqing Oilfield, used only seven months and twenty-one days to break through the 60,000-meter drilling mark on September 11 and 12, pushing China's deep drilling technology to a new level.

This record far surpasses the 40,816 meters drilled in a year by the Soviet Union's Polyanovsky drilling team in 1965. The average monthly drilling speed of these two drilling teams reached 7,850 meters, setting a new world standard for drilling.

The heroic workers of the 1202 and 1205 drilling teams, with the bold ambition to scale heights never before reached, proposed a drilling target of 50,000 meters at the beginning of this year. They achieved this goal in less than seven months, both teams reaching the 50,000-meter mark in mid-August, with all wells of the highest quality.

At a meeting celebrating the two teams' achievement of drilling 50,000 meters, the oilfield party committee presented each worker with a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." After receiving these four golden volumes, the workers excitedly said: It is with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that we have overcome all difficulties and achieved all victories. The workers of these two drilling teams have consistently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, drawing boundless wisdom and strength from them, and putting them into practice. They have fought the production battle as a political battle and a battle of revolutionary will. As a result, the drilling speed has continued to increase, and the two teams, after scaling the 50,000-meter peak, created a new world record of 60,000 meters in just over twenty days. To date, the total drilling length of these two teams has exceeded last year's by more than one-fold, far surpassing the Soviet Union's highest drilling record. Among them, the 1205 team has 14 wells, and the 1202 team has 11 wells, all of which are high-quality wells drilled with one drill bit in one day. In contrast, in old China, it took 42 years to drill a total of only 74,000 meters of oil wells.

The new achievements in drilling technology created by these two drilling teams are a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This fact once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is a treasure for continuous revolution, a compass guiding us from victory to victory, and a golden bridge to the highest peaks of science and technology. Since the beginning of the year, the party branches of these two drilling teams have consistently organized workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arming the workers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought and guiding all their actions with it. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers' revolutionary spirit has been further ignited. They have thoroughly smashed the bourgeois technical "authorities" and actively engaged in worker-designed technology. The drill bits they designed themselves can each drill over 1,000 meters. Last year, the 1205 team had no drill bits that could drill 1,000 meters, but since this year, 23 drill bits have drilled over 1,000 meters, setting a new standard for drill bit usage.

### 毛泽东思想武装的人敢于攀登科学技术高峰  大庆创造钻井技术世界新水平

    毛泽东思想武装的人敢于攀登科学技术高峰
    大庆创造钻井技术世界新水平
    据新华社十三日讯　用毛泽东思想武装起来的大庆人，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，以无比高昂的英雄气概登上了前人没有攀登过的新高峰。石油工业部五好红旗单位标兵、大庆油田一二○二和一二○五钻井队，只用七个月零二十一天时间，在九月十一和十二日分别突破了钻井六万米的大关，把我国钻深井的技术推向了一个新水平。
    这项纪录，远远超过了苏联一九六五年公布的波良可夫斯基钻井队创造的全年钻井四万零八百一十六米的最高纪录。这两个钻井队平均月钻井速度达到七千八百五十米，创造了世界钻井的最先进水平。
    英雄的一二○二和一二○五钻井队的全体职工，以敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰的雄心壮志，在今年年初就提出了钻井五万米的战斗目标。他们用了不到七个月的时间，在八月中旬就实现了自己的誓言，双双获得钻井五万米的新成就，口口井质量全优。
    在庆祝这两个队登上钻井五万米高峰的大会上，油田党委给两个队的职工每人发了一套《毛泽东选集》。职工们得到这四本金光闪闪的宝书以后，激动地说：我们就是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想战胜一切敌人，克服一切困难，夺取一切胜利的。这两个钻井队的职工常年坚持活学活用毛主席著作，他们从毛主席著作中汲取了无穷无尽的智慧和力量，并且把它用到了实际行动中去，抓革命，促生产，把生产仗当政治仗打，当革命志气仗打。结果，钻井速度越来越快，两个队终于在攀登钻井五万米高峰以后的二十多天，又创造了钻井六万米的世界新水平。到现在，这两个队钻井总进尺超过去年一倍多，把苏联的钻井最高纪录远远甩到后边。其中一二○五队有十四口井，一二○二队有十一口井，是用一只钻头一天时间钻进一千米的优质井。而在旧中国，四十二年总共才打了七万四千多米油井。
    这两个钻井队在钻井技术上创造的新成就，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这一事实再一次说明，毛泽东思想是不断革命的法宝，是从胜利走向胜利的指南针，是通往科学技术最高峰的金桥。从年初开始，这两个钻井队的党支部始终坚持组织职工活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装职工的头脑，用毛泽东思想指导职工的一切行动。在无产阶级文化大革命中，工人们革命精神更加焕发，大破资产阶级技术“权威”，大搞工人设计。他们自己设计的钻头，每只都能钻井一千多米。去年，一二○五队没有一个钻头钻进一千米，今年以来就有二十三个钻头钻进一千米，创出了钻头使用的新水平。
