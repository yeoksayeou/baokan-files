    Singing the praises of Chairman Mao's quotation board,
    In the fields of Shanxi Datong County, Hetou Commune, Ma Shenghai's quotation board,
    Placed in the fields, the sun shines brighter and the sky is bluer,
    Dust retreats a thousand miles, mountains seem lower,
    Crops remain green even without rain, the harder the work, the more joyful the song.
    Look up at the quotation board, strength surges through the body;
    Rest a while in front of the quotation board, thoughts circle the globe three times...
    The quotation board, hanging in the hall,
    The red sun never sets in the home,
    It illuminates both day and night,
    Chairman Mao is always by our side.
    Heartfelt words of advice, the direction forward clearly pointed out,
    Teaching us to brave the stormy waves,
    Teaching us to see the blue sky through the clouds,
    Teaching us to protect the people's mountains and rivers,
    Teaching us to pass on the revolutionary red flag from generation to generation.
    Quotation board, shining with golden light,
    Every word and sentence etched in the heart,
    It is the revolutionary guidepost,
    Leading us to ride the winds and break the waves, forever moving forward!

    歌唱毛主席语录牌
    山西大同县河头公社　马生海语录牌，插田间，太阳更亮天更蓝，风尘退千里，高山低一半，庄稼无雨还添绿，活儿越紧歌越欢。抬头望望语录牌，浑身上下力气添；语录牌前歇一歇，心绕地球转三圈……语录牌，挂堂前，家中红日不落山，照完白天照黑夜，毛主席就在咱身边。贴心话儿细嘱咐，前进方向亲指点，教咱激流当中顶巨浪，教咱透过云雾看青天，教咱要把人民江山保，教咱要把革命红旗代代传。语录牌啊金光闪，字字句句记心间，它是革命的指路牌，引导我们乘风破浪永向前！
