	Comrades, students, Red Guards:

	To carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution well, you have come to Beijing from all over the country, to be by the side of our great leader Chairman Mao. You have worked hard! On behalf of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, I extend warm greetings to you! We warmly welcome you!

	Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, with the "Sixteen Points" formulated under his guidance as our beacon, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is developing victoriously nationwide. The situation is excellent! The situation is getting better and better!

	Red Guards and revolutionary students, your direction of struggle is always correct. Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee firmly support you! The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers also firmly support you! Your revolutionary actions have shaken the entire society and the remnants of the old world. In the struggle to smash the "Four Olds" and establish the "Four News," you have achieved brilliant results. Those in power who are taking the capitalist road, those reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, those bloodsuckers, and parasites have all been made to look ridiculous by you. You are right, and you have done well!

	Chairman Mao teaches us that the fundamental contradiction that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to resolve is the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist and capitalist roads. The focus of this movement is to struggle against those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. To bombard the headquarters is to bombard a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road. Our country is a socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The leadership of our country is in the hands of the proletariat. To overthrow a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road is precisely to consolidate and strengthen our proletarian dictatorship. It is clear that a handful of reactionary bourgeois elements, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, are different from us. They oppose the dictatorship of the broad revolutionary masses led by the proletariat. They attempt to bombard our proletarian revolutionary headquarters. Can we allow them to do this? No, we must smash their plots and tricks, expose them, and not let their plots succeed. They are only a handful, but sometimes they can deceive good people. We must firmly grasp the correct direction of the struggle. Without this correct direction, we will go astray.

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary students have a common goal and a unified direction. Everyone should unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance together!

	Now, some people are going against Chairman Mao's instructions and the "Sixteen Points," using the deep class feelings of the workers and peasants towards the Party and Chairman Mao to create a rift between the workers and peasants and revolutionary students, inciting the workers and peasants to struggle against revolutionary students. We must not fall for their tricks!

	Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party with Chairman Mao at its helm, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have always been the main force of our revolution. Today, they are the main force of our socialist revolution and socialist construction, and also the main force of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	We, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, must listen to Chairman Mao, firmly hold our production posts, and firmly hold our battle posts. We must resolutely stand on the side of revolutionary students, support their revolutionary actions, and be their strong backing.

	Red Guards and all revolutionary youth are the excellent offspring of the Chinese people. You should learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Learn from their most steadfast revolutionary stance, their most thorough revolutionary spirit. Learn from their high organizational discipline and all their excellent qualities. Like the workers, peasants, and soldiers, you should always be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. In the great storms of revolutionary struggle, temper yourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Under the leadership of our great leader, great teacher, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, and under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary students should unite, and all revolutionary comrades should unite, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live the great Communist Party of China!

	Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    在接见全国各地来京革命师生大会上
    林彪同志的讲话
    同志们，同学们，红卫兵战士们：
    为了搞好无产阶级文化大革命，你们从全国各地，来到北京，来到我们伟大的领袖毛主席身边。你们辛苦了！我代表毛主席，代表党中央，向你们问好！我们热烈地欢迎你们！
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，在毛主席领导下，以毛主席主持制定的十六条为指南，正在全国范围内胜利地向前发展。形势好得很！形势越来越好！
    红卫兵战士们，革命同学们，你们斗争的大方向，始终是正确的。毛主席和党中央坚决支持你们！广大工农兵群众也坚决支持你们！你们的革命行动，震动了整个社会，震动了旧世界遗留下来的残渣余孽。你们在大破“四旧”、大立“四新”的战斗中，取得了光辉的战果。那些走资本主义道路的当权派，那些资产阶级反动“权威”，那些吸血鬼，寄生虫，都被你们搞得狼狈不堪。你们做得对，做得好！
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的根本矛盾，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾。这次运动的重点，是斗争那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派。炮打司令部，就是炮打一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我们的国家，是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。我们国家的领导权，是掌握在无产阶级手里。斗倒一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，正是为了巩固和加强我们的无产阶级专政。很明显，一小撮反动资产阶级分子，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右五类分子和我们不同，他们反对无产阶级为首的广大革命人民群众对他们的专政，他们企图炮打我们无产阶级革命的司令部，我们能容许他们这样干吗？不能，我们要粉碎这些牛鬼蛇神的阴谋诡计，识破他们，不要让他们的阴谋得逞。他们只是一小撮人，但是他们有时能够欺骗一些好人。我们一定要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。离开了这个大方向，就会走到邪路上去。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大工农兵群众和革命学生，目标是共同的，方向是一致的。大家要在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，团结起来，携手前进！
    现在，有些人违背毛主席的指示，违背十六条，利用工农群众对党对毛主席的深厚的阶级感情，制造工农群众和革命学生的对立，挑动工农群众去斗争革命学生。我们千万不要上他们的当！
    在毛主席为首的中国共产党领导下的工农兵群众，从来就是我国革命的主力军。今天，他们是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的主力军，也是我国无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。
    我们工农兵群众，一定要听毛主席的话，坚守生产岗位，坚守战斗岗位。要坚决站在革命学生一边，支持他们的革命行动，做他们的强大后盾。
    红卫兵和一切革命青少年，是我国人民的优秀儿女。你们要向工农兵学习。学习他们最坚定的革命立场，最彻底的革命精神。学习他们高度的组织性、纪律性和一切优良品质。要像工农兵那样，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民，在革命斗争的大风大浪中，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    在我们的伟大领袖、伟大导师、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的领导下，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，工农兵群众和革命学生团结起来，一切革命同志团结起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
