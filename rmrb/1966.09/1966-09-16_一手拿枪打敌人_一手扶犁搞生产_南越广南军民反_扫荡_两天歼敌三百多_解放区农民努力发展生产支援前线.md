With one hand holding a gun to fight the enemy, with the other hand plowing to produce, the military and civilian people of Quang Nam in South Vietnam fought back against enemy "sweeping operations" for two days, annihilating over three hundred enemy soldiers. Farmers in the liberated areas are striving to develop production to support the front line.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 14th, the Vietnamese South Liberation News Agency reported: The brave and skilled liberation armed forces of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam, using the iron fist of people's war, once again smashed the enemy's two "sweeping operations" on September 3rd and 5th, annihilating over three hundred American invaders and puppet soldiers, and destroying or damaging eight M-113 type amphibious armored vehicles.

On the morning of September 3rd, a company of American invaders, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched a "sweeping operation" along the highway in Vinh Dien County. As soon as the enemy reached the north bank of the Au Ban River, they fell into the ambush of the liberation armed forces and were immediately killed or wounded over seventy. The American invaders hurriedly opened fire to rescue them, but instead hit their own remaining forces, damaging two M-113 type amphibious armored vehicles. When the remaining American invaders broke through and fled, they were again pursued and annihilated by the liberation armed forces.

On the 5th, two companies of American invaders and one company of puppet soldiers launched a second "sweeping operation" in three directions towards Vinh Dien County. The guerrilla forces of Chau Thanh Commune bravely intercepted them, killing over sixty enemy soldiers. The guerrilla forces of Go Noi, An Hoa, and Chau Luc Communes also surrounded and annihilated the enemy from all sides, eliminating nearly two hundred American invaders and completely smashing the enemy's "sweeping operation."

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the Vietnamese South Liberation News Agency reported: The people of the southern liberated areas in South Vietnam are actively protecting and developing production to support the front line.

Under the slogan "One hand holding a gun, the other hand plowing," the people of the southern liberated areas have overcome many difficulties caused by the American bandits and their lackeys, striving to complete their production tasks. People in various places have dug a large number of shelters and battle fortifications to ensure that they can fight the enemy at any time and protect production.

The people of various liberated areas in the eastern part of the south have established more than 140 mutual aid groups, overcoming the difficulties of lack of manpower and draft animals, and actively developing production. Women in Tu Du Province are actively learning production skills to take over the production tasks of men. Hundreds of women and many "soldier mothers" have already learned agricultural work that was previously only done by men. Farmers in various places have also learned and applied many new production techniques, such as soaking seeds, fertilizing, and planting double-cropped rice. They have planted over 170 hectares of March rice, achieving an average yield of 2,000 to 2,200 kilograms of rice per hectare.

Currently, farmers in various liberated areas have not only successfully completed the planting plan for the late crop but have also planted many miscellaneous grains and other crops to achieve a bumper harvest.

Over 100 mutual aid groups in Vinh Hung Commune, Cao Lai County, Thin Lieu Province have relied on collective strength to overcome the destruction caused by American bandits and their lackeys, successfully completing the transplanting of all late rice. Farmers have also helped injured soldiers, families of martyrs, and families of soldiers to cultivate a batch of fields. Farmers in the liberated areas of Binh Tuy Province dug eight irrigation canals totaling eight kilometers long in July, repaired 35 old irrigation canals totaling 36 kilometers long, and built a reservoir that can irrigate over 2,000 hectares of land, increasing the area of double-cropped rice fields by 120 hectares compared to before.

    南越广南军民反“扫荡”两天歼敌三百多　解放区农民努力发展生产支援前线
    据新华社河内十四日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：英勇善战的越南南方广南省解放武装力量，用人民战争的铁拳，在九月三日和五日再次粉碎了敌人的两次“扫荡”，歼灭美国侵略军和伪军三百多名，击毁和击伤M—113型两栖装甲车八辆。
    九月三日上午，美国侵略军一个连在飞机大炮的掩护下，向维川县的公路沿线发动“扫荡”，当敌人刚刚开到秋盆河北岸的时候，就陷入解放武装力量的伏击阵地，立即被打死打伤七十多名。美国侵略者赶忙开炮援救，却反而击中了美军自己的残余部队，击伤M—113型两栖装甲车两辆。当剩下的美国侵略军突围逃跑时，又被解放武装力量追击歼灭了一批。
    五日，两个连的美国侵略军和一个连伪军，又分成三路向维川县发动第二次“扫荡”。川清乡游击队英勇截击，打死敌人六十多名。鹅内、安和、川禄等乡的游击队也四面分割围歼敌人，消灭美国侵略军近二百名，彻底粉碎了敌人的“扫荡”。
    新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方南部解放区人民，积极保卫生产，发展生产，支援前线。
    在“一手拿枪，一手扶犁”的口号下，南部解放区人民战胜了美国强盗及其走狗造成的许多困难，力争胜利完成生产任务。各地人民都挖筑了大量的掩蔽洞和战斗工事，以保证随时同敌人战斗，保卫生产。
    南部东区各解放区的人民，已经成立一百四十多个互助组，克服了缺乏人力和畜力的困难，积极发展生产。土龙木省的妇女积极学习生产技术，代替男子承担生产任务。数以百计的妇女和许多“战士母亲”，已经学会过去只有男子才会干的农活。各地农民还学习和运用了许多新的生产技术，如浸种、施肥和种双季稻等。他们种的一百七十多公顷三月稻，获得了平均每公顷产两千到两千二百公斤稻谷的好收成。
    目前，各解放区农民不仅已经胜利完成了晚造的种植计划，而且还种了许多杂粮和其它农作物，以夺取生产丰收。
    薄寮省稼来县永兴乡一百多个互助组，依靠集体的力量，战胜了美国强盗及其走狗的破坏，胜利完成了全部晚稻的插秧工作。农民们还帮助伤员、烈士家属和军人家属耕种了一批田地。槟椥省解放区农民，在七月份共挖了长达八公里的八条水渠，修整了长达三十六公里的三十五条旧水渠，并修筑了一个可灌溉两千多公顷土地的蓄水坝，使一年两造的稻田面积比以前增加了一百二十公顷。
