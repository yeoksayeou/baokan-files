	Bringing Back All the Fruits of Hard Work
	Hubei and Jiangxi Farmers Carefully Harvest New Cotton

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 13th - The broad masses of farmers in Hubei's rural areas are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They have overcome this year's severe drought, and cotton production is showing a very good situation. Currently, the broad masses of farmers are carefully harvesting new cotton, determined to bring back all the fruits of their hard work.

	Since early July, many places in Hubei Province have not had a single heavy rain. Faced with the severe drought, the production teams of various communes have emphasized proletarian politics, learned and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, armed the broad masses of farmers with Mao Zedong Thought, greatly enhanced the farmers' confidence and strength to overcome natural disasters, and effectively promoted this year's cotton production.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, September 13th - The cotton growth in most areas of Jiangxi Province is excellent, with bolls laden and generally better than last year. Currently, the early-planted high-yield cotton is entering the peak period of boll opening and picking, and the farmers are busily harvesting.

	Just as the cotton was heavily bolling in July and August, many cotton-producing areas experienced dry and hot weather, which was unfavorable for cotton growth. The broad masses of farmers and cadres in the cotton-producing areas actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, emphasized proletarian politics, established the thought of farming for revolution, and with revolutionary spirit, waged a tenacious struggle against the drought, ensuring the normal growth of cotton.

    靠毛泽东思想夺得生产好形势
    把辛勤劳动的果实全部收回来
    湖北江西社员细摘新棉
    据新华社武汉十三日电　湖北农村广大社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜了今年的严重干旱，棉花生产出现一片大好形势。目前，广大社员正在精细地采摘新棉，决心把辛勤劳动得来的果实全部收回来。
    自七月上旬以来，湖北省许多地方没有落过透雨。在严重的干旱面前，各地人民公社生产队突出无产阶级政治，通过活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装了广大社员头脑，极大地增强了社员们战胜自然灾害的信心和力量，有力地推动了今年的棉花生产。
    据新华社南昌十三日电　江西省绝大部分地区的棉花长势喜人，结桃累累，普遍好于去年。目前，早播的良种棉已进入吐絮收花盛期，社员们正紧张地进行收摘。
    正当七八月份棉花大量结桃的时候，不少产棉地区出现了干旱高温天气，这对棉花生长很不利。棉区广大社员和干部活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，树立了为革命种田的思想，革命精神焕发，和干旱展开了顽强的斗争，保证了棉花的正常生长。
