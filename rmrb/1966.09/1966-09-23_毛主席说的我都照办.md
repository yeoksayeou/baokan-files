I am very concerned about the current Cultural Revolution taking place in China. I heard that on June 6, high school students in Beijing wrote a letter to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, strongly demanding the abolition of the old admission system. I think this is a very remarkable action. Because they, like me, are all third-year high school students. Such admirable thoughts and actions can only be produced under the leadership of Chairman Mao. In our country, going to university is just about rote learning, and no one cares about others' affairs. People like this are what imperialism and Sato need.

We will never be content to be slaves, so what should we do? I can only arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought and put it into practice. Chairman Mao is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of the people of the world. Chairman Mao is my best teacher. Mao Zedong Thought is the compass guiding my daily life.

I bought the July 5 issue of Beijing Weekly. The first page featured a full-page photo of Chairman Mao. I cannot describe the excitement I felt when I saw Chairman Mao's portrait. My eyes were filled with tears. Whatever Chairman Mao says, I will do, even if it means giving up my own life.

Long live Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live Chairman Mao!

    毛主席说的我都照办
    我很关心现在正在中国进行的社会主义文化大革命。听说六月六日北京高中学生写信给党中央和毛主席，强烈要求废除旧升学制度，我认为这是非常了不起的行动。因为他们同我一样，都是高中三年级的学生。那种令人钦佩的思想和行动，只有在毛主席领导下的中国才能产生。在我国，上大学只是死读书，对别人的事根本不放在心上。像这样的人是帝国主义及佐藤所需要的。
    我们决不甘心当奴隶，那么我们怎么办才好？我只有好好地用毛泽东思想武装自己，并把它付诸实践。毛主席不仅是中国人民的，而且是世界人民的。毛主席是我最好的导师。毛泽东思想是指导我日常生活的指南针。
    我买了七月五日的《北京周报》。第一页以整页篇幅登了毛主席的照片。我看到毛主席像时的激动心情很难用笔墨形容。我眼里充满了热泪。只要是毛主席说的，不管什么事，我都照办，甚至献出我自己的生命。
    毛泽东思想万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
