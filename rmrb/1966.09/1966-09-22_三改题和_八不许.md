Title: The Three Revisions of the Title and the "Eight Nos"

Edition: 6

The second issue of *Theatre Journal* this year published an article titled "Whose Service Does Tian Han's Dramatic Propositions Serve?" This article, which "criticizes" Tian Han, was personally revised six times by Lin Mofan. The title itself underwent three revisions before being finalized.

The original title was: "Tian Han's Anti-Socialist Literary Line Must Be Criticized." The first revision was: "Criticizing Tian Han's Bourgeois Literary Line"; the second revision was: "Whose Service Does Tian Han's Literary Thought Serve?"; the third revision was: "Whose Service Does Tian Han's Dramatic Propositions Serve?"

Why did Lin Mofan pay so much attention to this article? Why was the title gradually toned down?

We know that Tian Han is a key figure in Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. For a long time, under the protection of Zhou Yang and Lin Mofan, he has committed countless anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes. When he had to be criticized in public, Lin Mofan meticulously planned this fake criticism and real cover-up scheme.

When writing this article, Lin Mofan proposed the "Eight Nos": (1) Do not mobilize workers, peasants, and soldiers to criticize; only allow the Drama Association to write one fake criticism to conclude the matter, thereby completely negating the 32 topics proposed by revolutionary comrades in the Drama Association for publicly criticizing Tian Han; (2) Do not expose the large amount of black talk Tian Han has spread in various internal meetings; only his publicly published articles can be quoted; (3) Do not mention insinuations; (4) Do not mention political issues; only literary issues can be mentioned; (5) Do not mention "revisionism"; (6) Do not mention "historical issues"; (7) Do not mention Tian Han's anti-party stance; (8) Do not mention line issues.

This list of "Eight Nos" is like eight ropes tightly binding the hands and feet of the masses. Whenever Lin Mofan saw something written that he did not allow to be exposed and criticized, he would strike it out with a big pen.

Tian Han had already surrendered to the Kuomintang in 1935 and became a traitor. For thirty years, he has never given up his reactionary stance, always following Zhou Yang, and opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line. Tian Han's crimes are numerous; he is a genuine representative of the bourgeoisie who has infiltrated the party. Lin Mofan's excessive protection of him is because they are figures from the same black line. Many of Tian Han's anti-party crimes are connected to Lin Mofan. If Tian Han is exposed, Lin Mofan himself will be in danger, so he has racked his brains and resorted to tricks to cover up the traitor Tian Han. Those who think they are clever are actually foolish; Lin Mofan did not realize that on this issue, he has exposed his own ugly face.

### 三改题和“八不许”

    三改题和“八不许”
    今年第二期《戏剧报》上发表了一篇“批判”田汉的文章，题目叫《田汉的戏剧主张为谁服务？》。这篇文章经林默涵亲手改了六次，这个标题也是三改而后定。
    原题是：《田汉的反社会主义文艺路线必须批判》。一改为：《田汉的资产阶级文艺路线批判》；二改为：《田汉的文艺思想为谁服务》；三改为：《田汉的戏剧主张为谁服务？》。
    为什么林默涵这样关心这篇文章？为什么标题“逐步降级”？
    我们知道，田汉是周扬反革命修正主义集团中的一员大将。长期以来，在周扬、林默涵的庇护下，干了无数反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动。在众目睽睽之下，不得不进行批判的时候，林默涵就精心策划了这个假批判、真掩护的大骗局。
    在写这篇文章的时候，林默涵提出了“八不许”：（一）不许发动工农兵批判，只准剧协写一篇假批判了结，从而全面否定了剧协革命同志提出的公开批判田汉的三十二个选题；（二）不许揭露田汉在内部各种场合放出的大量黑话，只能引用其公开发表的文章；（三）不许提影射；（四）不许提政治问题，只许提学术问题；（五）不许提“修正主义”；（六）不许提“历史问题”；（七）不许提田汉反党；（八）不许提路线问题。
    这也不许，那也不许，一句话，就是不许真批判。这“八不许”像八条绳子一样，紧紧捆住群众的手脚。林默涵见到写了他不许揭露批判的东西，就大笔一挥，统统砍掉。
    田汉早在一九三五年就投降了国民党，当了叛徒。三十年来一直没有放弃他的反动立场，一直追随周扬，与毛主席提出的无产阶级的文艺路线相对抗。田汉罪行累累，是一个道道地地的混进党内的资产阶级代表人物。林默涵所以对他这样爱护备至，就是因为他们是同一条黑线中的人物。田汉的很多反党罪行，都与林默涵有牵连，揪出田汉，林默涵也自身难保，因此他才这样绞尽脑汁，耍尽阴谋，掩护叛徒田汉。自以为聪明的反动家伙其实都是愚蠢的，林默涵没有想到在这个问题上正好暴露出他的丑恶嘴脸。　（选自中国戏剧家协会的大字报）林默涵包庇《赛金花》
