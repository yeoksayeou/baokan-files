Workers in the machinery industry have created more than a thousand new products

In the first eight months of this year, the main products have increased significantly

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, the broad masses of workers in China's machinery industry, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and have advanced courageously on both the spiritual and material fronts. The workers' revolutionary spirit is soaring, and their enthusiasm is boundless, promoting continuous achievements in machinery industry production.

Since this year, the broad masses of workers in the machinery industry have more consciously read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao's words, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with even greater momentum. In the first eight months of this year, the main products of the machinery industry have all increased significantly. Machine tools, automobiles, metallurgical equipment, mining machinery, electric motors, and industrial bearings, among forty main products, have completed more than seventy percent of the annual plan. The output of some products has increased several times compared to the same period last year, and the quality of the products has steadily improved. New products have increased significantly, and many of these new products have reached world advanced levels.

Under the great guidance of Chairman Mao's thought that "the people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history," more and more workers and young technical personnel have participated in product design and scientific research work. They bravely broke through various obstacles set by bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," shattered various foreign and old frameworks, and created many unique, highly efficient, and widely applicable new products, new technologies, and new equipment. These workers and technical personnel, nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought, have shown outstanding abilities in production struggles and scientific experiments.

Since this year, machinery industry workers across the country have collectively developed more than a thousand new products, mainly including: thread grinding machines with processing precision up to zero grade, medium-sized coordinate grinding machines with positioning precision up to three microns, new "Red Flag" three-row high-end sedans, electronic bombardment furnaces, 150-type deep well oil drilling machines, continuous vacuum coating equipment, etc. The 100,000-kilowatt water turbine generator set developed this year has also been installed and started generating electricity.

In the technical innovation and technological revolution activities carried out this year, the broad masses of workers in the machinery industry have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war, vigorously promoted the "three-in-one combination," and extensively carried out communist big cooperation, effectively promoting the high-speed development of production. The Shanghai Heavy Machinery Plant, within the factory, has vigorously promoted the "three-in-one combination" of workers, cadres, and technical personnel, and simultaneously implemented the "three-in-one combination" of factories, scientific research units, and colleges and universities. With the cooperation of many units, after two years of effort, during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have mastered the advanced technology of electric slag remelting, smelted a 100-ton large steel ingot, and reached the peak of world smelting new technology.

Currently, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among machinery industry workers is being carried out more extensively and deeply. They are eagerly studying Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implementing the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote production, and striving to complete the tasks of the first year of China's Third Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    活学活用毛主席著作  大大发扬革命精神
    机械工业职工制成上千种新产品
    今年前八个月，主要产品大幅度增长
    据新华社讯　我国机械工业广大职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在精神和物质两条战线上奋勇前进。职工们革命精神振奋，干劲十足，促进机械工业生产不断取得新的成就。
    今年以来，广大机械工业职工更加自觉地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，掀起了声势更加壮阔的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。今年前八个月，机械工业主要产品都大幅度增长。机床、汽车、冶金设备、矿山机械、电机，以及工业轴承等四十种主要产品，完成了全年计划的百分之七十以上。有些产品的产量比去年同期成倍增长，产品的质量稳步提高。新产品大量增加，其中不少新产品具有世界先进水平。
    在毛主席的“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”的伟大思想教导下，越来越多的工人和青年技术人员参加了产品设计和科学研究工作。他们勇敢地冲破了资产阶级“专家”、“权威”的种种阻挠，打破了种种洋框框、旧框框，创造了很多风格独特、效能很高和用途广泛的新产品、新工艺、新设备。这些在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的工人设计员和技术人员，在生产斗争和科学实验中显示了卓越的才能。
    今年以来，全国各地机械工业职工一共试制成功了上千种新产品，主要有：加工精度可以达到零级的螺纹磨床，定位精度可达三微米的中型座标搪床，新型“红旗”三排座高级轿车，电子轰击炉，一五○型深井石油钻机，连续真空镀膜设备等。试制成功的十万瓩水轮发电机组今年也已安装发电。
    机械工业战线广大职工在今年开展的技术革新和技术革命活动中，活学活用毛主席有关人民战争的思想，大搞“三结合”，广泛开展共产主义大协作，有力地促进了生产高速度发展。上海重型机器厂在厂内大搞以工人为主的、同领导干部和技术人员的“三结合”，同时实行工厂、科学研究单位和高等院校的“三结合”，在许多单位的协作下，经过两年努力，在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中掌握了电渣重熔的先进技术，炼出了一百吨重的大钢锭，登上了世界冶炼新技术的高峰。
    目前，随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，机械工业职工活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动更加广泛深入地展开。他们如饥如渴地学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻执行党中央和毛主席关于抓革命、促生产的号召，为提前完成我国第三个五年计划第一年的任务而努力。
