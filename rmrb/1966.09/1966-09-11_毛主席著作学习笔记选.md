	Leaving No Room for Oneself

	One day, I wrote an article about learning from Wang Jie. After finishing it, I asked my roommate Xiao Fan to give me some feedback. He frankly pointed out several issues, one of which struck me deeply.

	My draft read: "...Wang Jie is just an ordinary soldier. What Wang Jie can do, I will strive to do..." Xiao Fan looked at the words "strive to do" and frowned, saying, "Why write it so vaguely?" His words hit the nail on the head, and my face immediately turned red.

	To be honest, when I wrote that sentence, I had a struggle in my mind. I wanted to write: "What Wang Jie can do, I will definitely do." But then I thought, writing it like that wouldn't be good; it would seem too certain. What if I can't do it? So, I changed it to "strive to do." This way, it sounds better and leaves room for myself. Now, Xiao Fan's words hit the mark, making me think about many issues. First, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings about "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, about White and Zhang, and especially about Wang Jie. I felt extremely ashamed and felt that I had let Chairman Mao's teachings down. I thought about it and realized that it was because I had too much selfishness and not enough determination. These things became stumbling blocks in my path forward. So, I immediately took up my pen, crossed out the words "strive to do," and wrote clearly: "I will definitely do it."

	Words and Actions

	The branch committee was discussing the mid-year evaluation when suddenly a heavy rain started outside. The platoon leader next to me exclaimed, "I wonder if the windows in the storage room upstairs are closed?" I also expressed concern, saying, "Yes, I wonder if they are closed?" But I didn't think about going to close them myself. At that moment, the platoon leader stood up and went out. Only after he knew that someone had closed the windows did he return and sit down. The platoon leader's words and actions made me feel so ashamed that I wanted to hide.

	Almost the same words, but the actions were so different. What does this show? I asked myself, doesn't this show that there is still a big gap between my thoughts and the platoon leader's?

	From this small incident of closing windows, I realized: the issue of words and actions actually reflects the courage, determination, and perseverance in transforming one's thoughts and carrying out self-revolution. A warrior with a high level of proletarian consciousness must speak and act consistently, with inner and outer consistency. Although I didn't do well in the past, I think I should use this living example to further strengthen my self-transformation. In the great revolutionary struggle, I should make my words and actions closely connected, and make learning and using consistent. That is, I should actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially focus on the "use" aspect.

	Thinking About Rusty Needles

	Since the day I enlisted, six years have passed. My socks are as old as my enlistment time. The original shape of the socks is almost unrecognizable. Once, these socks had not been mended for several months and were so torn that they couldn't be worn. I took them out to mend, and when I opened my sewing kit, I found that the needles were rusty. This surprised me greatly. Clothes and socks that are not mended for a long time will cause the needles to rust, but what does the rusty needle imply?

	After enlisting, under the party's cultivation and education, and after learning from the shining example of Lei Feng, I gradually understood that one should be frugal in life; especially after studying Chairman Mao's works, I understood the profound meaning of frugality. The rusty needle sharply raised a question for me: is it that frugality was needed yesterday but not today? Today, can I mend and patch, but not tomorrow? No. If I think this way, it shows that my thoughts have also rusted. And rust in thoughts is much more frightening than rust in needles. Isn't the sugar-coated bullet of the bourgeoisie most likely to hit those whose thoughts have rusted? Isn't it most likely to break through our defenses from life? Therefore, I not only need to sharpen the needle, but more importantly, I need to sharpen my thoughts quickly.

	"Pain" and "Relief"

	There was a period when I hated it most when people said I was arrogant, but someone said I was not humble enough. With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's works and calmly considered it, feeling that others' opinions were correct. For example, when I first learned to fly, I paid great attention to the sliding speed, but now, sometimes I don't care much. Even when the leader criticized me, I didn't listen much. As a result, once during a slide, I almost slid out of the runway.

	In the process of transforming my thoughts, every time I touch on my shortcomings, the struggle is intense, and I feel very "painful." But once I follow Chairman Mao's teachings, humbly accept comrades' criticisms, and get rid of wrong thoughts, my heart feels a relief that I can't describe.

	Therefore, I often think this way: if a person has impure thoughts and doesn't pay attention to removing them, over time, they will become familiar with these impure thoughts. If this continues, it will be like having a sore on the body, growing bigger and bigger. At this time, if the doctor operates, it will be painful. Chairman Mao said: "If a person has appendicitis, the doctor removes the appendix, and the person is saved." I think more and more that Chairman Mao is right. We have many shortcomings and wrong thoughts, which are like diseases. When we have a disease, we must first be willing to treat it, make subjective efforts, and also use the doctor's medicine and scalpel. For the diseases in our thoughts, we must not be afraid of pain. Only by feeling pain can we be shocked, educated, and progress. Of course, this is a struggle, the process of struggle is the time of "pain"; but after the struggle is won, it is also the time when the feeling of "relief" appears.

  　毛主席著作学习笔记选
    空军某部飞行员　盛金根
    不给自己留“余地”
    一天，我写了一篇向王杰学习的稿子。写罢，请同屋小范同志提意见。他直率地提出了一些意见，其中的一条给我的震动很大。
    我的稿子是这样写的“……王杰同志也是一个普通战士，王杰同志做到的，我要努力去做，……”小范同志看着我写的“努力去做”这几个字，皱了皱眉头，说：“为什么写的这么活？”他这句话触到了痛处，我的脸立刻涨红起来。
    说实在的，当我写这句话的时候，思想上是有斗争的。我想写：“王杰同志能做到的，我一定要做到。”可是一想，这样写不好，显得太肯定了，人家会说我吹牛。做不到怎么办？便又改写成“努力去做”。这样写，既好听，又给自己“留有余地”。现在，小范同志一句话就抓住了我的要害。这句话提得好，使我想了很多问题。首先使我想起了毛主席关于“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，想到了白求恩、张思德，更想到了王杰。一时感到非常羞愧，感到非常对不起毛主席的教导。想来想去，还是由于私心太重，决心不大，这些东西成了自己前进途中的绊脚石。所以，我立刻拿起笔来，划掉了“努力去做”四个字，端端正正地写上了“一定要做到”。
    说和做
    支委会正在讨论上半年初评的情况，室外忽然下起了倾盆大雨。坐在我身旁的中队长不觉“哟”了一声：“楼上贮藏室的窗子不知道关了没有？”我也表示关心地接着说：“可不是，不知关了没有？”可是，我却根本没有想到自己应该去关。就在这个时候，中队长霍地站起来，走出去了，直到他知道窗子已经有人关了，才放心地回来坐下。中队长的这一言一行，羞得我简直无地自容。
    差不多的话，但行动却这样的悬殊，这说明了什么问题呢？我自己问自己，这不就说明我与中队长还存在着很大的思想差距吗？
    从关窗子这件小事，使我认识到：说和做的问题，实际上反映了思想改造和自我革命的勇气、决心和毅力。一个有高度无产阶级觉悟的战士，他一定是说到做到，言行一致，表里一致的。虽然我过去没有做好，但我想，应该通过这个活生生的例子，进一步加强对自己的思想改造，在伟大的革命斗争的实践中，使说和做密切联系起来，学和用一致起来。也就是说，活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    从针生锈想起的
    从入伍那一天算起，已经有六个年头了。我脚上的袜子跟我的入伍时间一样长，袜子原来的模样快认不出来了。一次，这双袜子有几个月没有缝补，破得实在不能穿，我才拿来缝补，打开针线包一看，针却生锈了。这使我大吃一惊。衣服袜子长期不补，针就会生锈，那么针生锈的背后又意味着什么呢？
    入伍以后，在党的培养教育下，在学习了雷锋的光辉榜样后，我渐渐地懂得了生活上应该艰苦朴素；特别是学习了毛主席著作以后，更明白了艰苦朴素的深远意义。针的生锈给我尖锐地提出了一个问题：是不是昨天应该艰苦朴素，今天就不需要艰苦朴素了呢？今天可以缝缝补补，明天是不是就不需要了呢？不。如果这样想，就说明思想上也长了锈。而思想上长锈要比针长锈可怕得多。资产阶级的糖衣炮弹不是最容易击中思想上长锈的人吗？不是最容易从生活上打破缺口向我们进攻吗？因此，我不但要去磨一磨针，更重要的是赶快磨一磨思想。
    “痛”和“痛快”
    有一个时期，我最忌讳别人说我骄傲，但偏偏有人说我不够谦虚。带着这个问题，我学习了毛主席著作，冷静下来一考虑，觉得别人的意见是对的。比方初学飞行，对滑飞速度十分注意，现在，有时就不很在乎，领导批评也听不大进去。结果有一次滑行，差一点滑到跑道外面去。
    在我思想改造的过程中，每当触及自己的缺点时，斗争总会很激烈，感到很“痛”。但是，一旦按照毛主席的教导，虚心地听取同志的批评，丢掉了错误思想，心里又有说不出的“痛快”。
    因此，我现在常常这样想：一个人思想上有了不干净的东西，又不注意去掉它，久而久之，就会对这些不干净的东西熟视无睹。这样下去，像身上长了疮一样，会越长越大。这时候，医生要动手术，就会感到痛。毛主席说：“一个人发了阑尾炎，医生把阑尾割了，这个人就救出来了。”我越想越觉得毛主席说得对。我们有许多缺点和错误思想，也好比有病。有了病，自己首先要愿意治，要作出主观的努力，同时要借助于“医生”的药物和刀子。对待我们思想上的毛病，硬是不能怕痛，痛了才能受到震动，才能受到教育，才会进步。当然，这是有斗争的，斗争的过程，就是“痛”的时候；但斗争胜利了，也就是“痛快”的感觉出现的时候了。
