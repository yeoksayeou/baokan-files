The Chinese Foreign Ministry has the right to broadcast on its own territory. The Indian government's slanders are mere trash taken from the U.S. imperialists' anti-China rumor mill, only exposing themselves as the creators of the tense situation on the Sino-Indian border.

Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: The Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a note to the Indian Embassy in China on September 15th, firmly rejecting the Indian government's unreasonable accusations and protests regarding the broadcasts by Chinese border troops.

The Chinese note is a response to the Indian Foreign Ministry's note dated July 28th. The reply note states: "Chinese border troops stationed at the China-Sikkim border at Nathu La Pass are broadcasting on Chinese territory, promoting Sino-Indian friendship, and explaining the truth about the Sino-Indian border issue. This is entirely within China's sovereignty and no outsider has the right to interfere. The Indian government's note accuses China of 'attempting to subvert' and 'interfering in India's internal affairs,' which is a slander against China. The note claims that China's broadcasts call on Indian military personnel to 'oppose the Indian government' and 'support the revolution and establish a true people's republic,' which are all fabricated lies."

The reply note says: "The Indian side's note about China subverting neighboring countries and expanding outward is mere trash taken from the U.S. imperialists' anti-China rumor mill and is not worth refuting. China has always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and is committed to the cause of Asian-African unity and anti-imperialism, which has been praised by the broad masses of Asian and African countries and peoples. On the contrary, it is the Indian government that has aligned itself with U.S. imperialism abroad, pursuing a pro-American, pro-Soviet, and anti-China policy, oppressing its neighbors, and pursuing expansionism. Domestically, it is anti-communist and anti-people, implementing brutal national oppression. The Indian government's reactionary policies go against the interests of the Indian people, causing widespread discontent and misery at home, and isolation and lack of support internationally. The Indian people's revolution is their own business, a result of the Indian government's reactionary domestic and foreign policies. How can others be blamed? China is a socialist country and does not interfere in the internal affairs of others. No matter how the Indian government fabricates and slanders, it will not tarnish the glorious image of socialist China."

The reply note also points out that the Indian government, on the one hand, unreasonably protested to the Chinese government, and on the other hand, set up broadcasting equipment on Sikkim territory on the Sino-Sikkim border to interfere with China's broadcasts and maliciously defame and insult the Chinese government. "However, the voice of truth cannot be stopped. Your despicable actions only expose yourselves and once again prove that you are the destroyers of Sino-Indian friendship and the creators of the tense situation on the border."

    我外交部照会驳斥印度政府的造谣诬蔑
    我边防部队有权在自己领土上广播
    印度政府的诬蔑是从美帝反华谣言库中拣来的破烂，只能暴露自己是中印边境紧张局势的制造者。
    新华社十八日讯　中国外交部九月十五日照会印度驻华大使馆，断然拒绝印度政府就中国边防部队进行广播所提出的无理指责和抗议。
    中国的照会是对印度外交部七月二十八日来照的驳复。这件复照指出：“驻守在中国—锡金边界乃堆拉山口的中国边防部队，在中国领土上进行广播，宣传中印人民友好，阐述有关中印边界问题的真相，这完全是中国主权范围内的事，任何外人都无权干涉。印度政府在来照中把中国方面的广播说成是‘企图进行颠覆’和
  ‘干涉印度内政’，这是对中国的诬蔑。来照说什么中国广播号召印军官兵
  ‘反对印度政府’和‘支持革命并建立一个真正的人民共和国’云云，完全是凭空捏造的谎言。”
    复照说：“印方来照中所谓中国对邻国进行颠覆和对外扩张的谰言，是从美帝国主义的反华谣言库中拣来的破烂，根本不值一驳。中国一贯恪守和平共处五项原则，致力于亚非团结反帝事业，受到广大亚非国家和人民的赞扬。相反的，倒是印度政府，对外投靠美帝国主义，执行亲美、联苏、反华的政策，欺压四邻，推行扩张主义，对内反共反人民，实行残酷的民族压迫。印度政府的倒行逆施，根本违背印度人民的利益，在国内搞得怨声载道，民不聊生，在国际上搞得失道寡助，空前孤立。印度人民要革命，是印度人民自己的事，是印度政府执行反动的内外政策的必然结果，怎么能怪得别人？中国是一个社会主义国家，从不干涉别国内政。不管印度政府如何造谣诬蔑，都丝毫无损于社会主义中国的光辉形象。”
    复照还指出，印度政府一方面向中国政府无理地提出了所谓抗议，一方面在中锡边境的锡金领土上设置广播机器，对中国的广播进行干扰，对中国政府进行恶毒诽谤和谩骂。“但是，真理的声音是阻挡不了的。你们的卑劣行为，只能暴露你们自己，再一次证明你们是中印人民友谊的破坏者和边境紧张局势的制造者。”
