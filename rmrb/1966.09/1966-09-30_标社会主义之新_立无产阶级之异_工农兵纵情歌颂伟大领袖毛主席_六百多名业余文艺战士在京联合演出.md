Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, more than 600 workers, peasants, and soldiers, as the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, performed a united show titled "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Sing Praises to Chairman Mao" on the evening of September 29 at the capital's art stage. The amateur art warriors from the Daqing Oilfield, rural areas of Hebei, and the People's Liberation Army units stationed in Beijing, with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, sang loudly and proudly, expressing the common voice of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the nation in their limitless love for Chairman Mao, and demonstrating their resolute will to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

So many amateur art warriors gathering on the capital's art stage for the first time in the history of the capital's National Day art performances is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This performance fully demonstrated the boundless artistic creativity and the courage and wisdom of the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought to set new standards for socialism and establish distinctive features of the proletariat. Their performance greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, setting an example for professional art workers to implement Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line.

Among the amateur art warriors who participated in this united performance were the "Five Good" model workers, "Five Good" employees, and "Five Good" family members from the Daqing Oilfield. There were also sharpshooters and artillery experts from the famous militia unit, the Guo Village Militia Camp in Hebei Province. There were "Five Good" community members from the people's commune where the active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Lü Yulan, resides. There were also production activists from the advanced agricultural unit in the style of Dazhai, the Shashiya Production Brigade of Yuguzhuang People's Commune in Xian County, Hebei. The active learner of Chairman Mao's works and first-class merit soldier Guo Xiaosi from the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, as well as the specially invited heroes and models such as Xu Yongjiang, who was awarded the first-class merit in the "August 6" naval battle, and Wang Yuchang, Chairman Mao's good soldier and first-class merit soldier, also participated in the performance. More than 200 young pioneers from the Dongfanghong Youth Amateur Choir of Beijing also took part in the performance. These amateur art warriors from the front lines of production and combat expressed the boundless love, faith, and admiration of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for the most beloved and respected great teacher, great leader, great commander-in-chief, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, through their songs and dances.

The worker and family member amateur performance team from the Daqing Oilfield performed "Daqing Workers Report Victory," a moving song of praise for Mao Zedong Thought. It vividly reflected how the people of Daqing, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's two brilliant works, "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," emphasized politics, learned from the People's Liberation Army, and with the proletarian spirit of "fighting the sky and the earth yields oil," created a miracle of the petroleum industry in the vast wilderness through self-reliance.

"In the east, the red sun has risen, Chairman Mao is wearing a green military uniform. The more you look, the brighter your heart becomes, and your whole body is filled with strength." The song "Chairman Mao Wears a Green Military Uniform," performed by eight female performers from the Hebei Province peasant amateur performance team, expressed the joy of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants upon hearing that Chairman Mao was wearing a green military uniform. This piece was created by the performers with tears of excitement on the night Chairman Mao received a million revolutionary students.

In the short song and dance "Both a Farmer and a Soldier," the audience saw the broad rural youth responding to Chairman Mao's call for universal military service, holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, ready to strike at any invader. With "Chairman Mao's Quotations" in their pockets and long guns on their backs, they sang and danced to the joyful music, vividly depicting scenes of labor such as harvesting with a sickle, plowing with a hoe, and transporting grain with a cart. Songs and dances like "The Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Love Chairman Mao" and "Hold the Gun Firmly in Your Hand" also expressed the most sincere feelings of millions of poor and lower-middle peasants for Chairman Mao.

The amateur performance team from the PLA units stationed in Beijing performed the grand chorus "The People's Army Marches Forward." In the majestic and stirring music and songs, they presented the battle history of the people's army to the audience: red flags fluttered in the flames of war, a group of Red Army soldiers in gray uniforms, carrying explosive packages, bravely crossed the Luding Bridge... The PLA soldiers, following in the footsteps of the Red Army, rowing wooden oars, a million heroes crossed the Yangtze River... The great commander-in-chief Mao led the people's army from victory to victory, planting red flags all over China.

The eight soldiers performed the multipart speech "Heroes of the Mao Zedong Era," using poetic language and combat poses to recreate the heroic images of Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun. Scene after scene moved the audience to deep respect for the revolutionary heroes.

Accompanied by the clear and resonant songs, collective dances and knife dances vividly recreated the majestic strides of the people's army. Soldiers from various branches of the PLA, with steel guns on their backs, holding sickles and hammers in one hand and Chairman Mao's works in the other, danced with joyful steps and sang with passion, vividly presenting to the audience the new image of the army implementing Chairman Mao's instructions, making the troops a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and carrying out military-farm, military-industry, military-civilian integration.

In just over twenty minutes of performance, it perfectly recreated the people's army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, as an invincible great army.

The ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was fully reflected in this performance. Many programs enthusiastically praised the great victories of the Cultural Revolution and the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, expressing their determination to fight to the end against rightists who oppose the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. The workers from Daqing performed the song and dance "Daqing People Forever Follow Chairman Mao," vividly portraying the oil workers' boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their deep hatred for class enemies, stirring up the audience's revolutionary passion.

The amateur performance team from the PLA units stationed in Beijing performed the grand chorus "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End," bringing the entire evening to its climax. More than a hundred revolutionary students and Red Guards, holding red copies of "Chairman Mao's Quotations," and several dozen young pioneers holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, sang and danced together, expressing the workers, peasants, and soldiers' eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao and the Party, and their resolute will to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. When the performers recited the great leader Chairman Mao receiving a million revolutionary students at Tiananmen, the stage was instantly filled with flying red ribbons and fluttering flags, presenting a festive scene in front of the audience at Tiananmen.

The more than twenty songs, dances, fast-talking, poetry recitations, and multipart speeches performed during the evening were all collectively created and rehearsed by the amateur art warriors. These programs had strong combativity, rich life flavors, and lively artistic forms. They broke through the frameworks set by bourgeois "authorities," appearing on the capital's art stage with a new look, showing that the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not only the demolition experts of old culture and old art but also have the wisdom and ability to create brilliant new socialist culture and art.

    六百多名业余文艺战士在京联合演出
    据新华社二十九日讯　在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，六百多名工农兵业余文艺战士以无产阶级文化大革命主力军的战斗姿态，二十九日晚在首都艺术舞台联合举行“工农兵歌颂毛主席”晚会。来自大庆油田、河北农村和中国人民解放军驻京陆海空三军的业余文艺战士，满怀革命豪情，昂首高歌，唱出了全国工农兵群众无限热爱毛主席的共同心声，表达了他们誓把文化大革命进行到底的坚强意志。
    这样多的业余文艺战士齐集于首都文艺舞台，这在首都国庆文艺演出史上是第一次。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。这次演出充分显示了用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众无穷的艺术创造才能和敢于标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异的勇气和智慧。他们的演出，大长无产阶级的志气，大灭资产阶级的威风，为广大专业文艺工作者树立了贯彻执行毛主席文艺路线的榜样。
    参加这次联合演出的业余文艺战士中，有来自大庆油田的五好标兵、五好职工和五好家属，有来自全国著名的民兵先进单位河北省郭庄民兵营的神枪手、神炮手，有来自学习毛主席著作积极分子吕玉兰所在人民公社的五好社员，还有来自大寨式先进农业单位、河北遵化县岳各庄公社沙石峪大队的生产积极分子。中国人民解放军北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、一等功臣郭小四，以及特邀来京的“八·六”海战荣立一等功的许永江，毛主席的好战士、一等功臣王裕昌等英雄模范人物和北京市东方红少年业余合唱团的二百多名少先队员也参加了演出。这些来自生产、战斗第一线的业余文艺战士，通过自己的歌声和舞蹈，表达了广大工农兵群众对最最敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜的感情。
    大庆油田的工人和家属业余演出队表演的《大庆职工报捷》，是一首激动人心的毛泽东思想的赞歌。它深刻而生动地反映了大庆人在毛主席《实践论》、《矛盾论》两部光辉巨著的指导下，突出政治，大学解放军，以“战天天低头，战地地出油”的无产阶级豪迈气概，在茫茫荒原上自力更生、创建石油工业奇迹的动人场景。
    “东方升起了红太阳，毛主席穿上了绿军装，越看心里越亮堂，浑身上下添力量”。由河北省农民业余演出队八个女演员演唱的《毛主席穿上了绿军装》，表现了广大贫下中农听到毛主席穿上绿军装以后的欢快心情。这个节目是演员们在毛主席接见百万革命师生的当天晚上含着激动的热泪创作出来的。
    在小歌舞《又是农民又是兵》里，观众看到了广大农村青年，响应毛主席全民皆兵的伟大号召，一手拿锄，一手拿枪，随时准备打击侵略者的昂扬斗志。他们怀揣《毛主席语录》，身背长枪，在欢快的音乐旋律中边歌边舞，逼真地表现了挥镰收割、挥锹翻地、推车运粮等劳动情景。《贫下中农最爱毛主席》、《紧握手中枪》等歌舞和说唱节目，也都表达了亿万贫下中农热爱毛主席的最真挚感情。
    驻京部队陆海空三军战士业余演出队演出的大联唱《人民军队向前进》，在雄壮激昂的乐声、歌声中，把人民军队走过的战斗历程再现在观众面前：红旗在战火中飘扬，一队身着灰军装的红军战士抱着炸药包，英勇地冲过了泸定桥……解放军战士踏着红军的脚印，划着木桨，百万雄师突破了长江……。伟大统帅毛主席指挥着人民军队从胜利走向胜利，把红旗插遍了全中国。

    随着嘹亮的歌声而出现的集体舞和刺杀舞等，生动地再现了人民军队阔步向前的雄姿。解放军各军种兵种的战士，身背钢枪，一手拿着镰刀和锤子、一手拿着毛主席著作，以欢跃的秧歌舞步和充满激情的歌唱，把我军贯彻毛主席的指示，使部队成为毛泽东思想的大学校，和实行军学、军农、军工、军民的新面貌生动形象地展现在观众眼前。
    短短二十多分钟的表演，完美地再现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队是一支战无不胜的伟大军队。
    正在深入发展着的无产阶级文化大革命运动，在这次演出中得到了充分的反映。很多节目热情歌颂了文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利和红卫兵小将们的革命造反精神，表达了他们誓和反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的右派分子斗争到底的决心。大庆工人表演的《大庆人永远跟着毛主席》表演唱，集中地表现了石油工人对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对阶级敌人的无比仇恨，激起了观众沸腾的革命激情。
    驻京部队陆海空三军战士业余演出队表演的大联唱《把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底》，使整个晚会达到了最高潮。一百多名革命师生和红卫兵，手拿鲜红的《毛主席语录》和几十名高举毛主席画像的少先队员一起载歌载舞，表现了工农兵群众永远忠于毛主席，忠于党，和誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强意志。当演员朗诵到伟大领袖毛主席在天安门接见百万革命师生的时候，舞台上顿时红绸飞舞，彩旗飘扬，在观众面前展现出天安门前一派节日狂欢的景象。
    晚会演出的二十多个歌舞、快板、诗朗诵、多口词等节目，都是业余文艺战士集体创作和排练出来的。这些节目具有强烈的战斗性，浓郁的生活气息和生动活泼的艺术形式。他们从革命内容和群众需要出发，冲破了资产阶级“权威”所设置的框框，以崭新的姿态出现在首都艺术舞台上，显示出用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，不仅是破坏旧文化、旧艺术的爆破手，同时也有智慧、有才能创造出光辉灿烂的社会主义的新文化、新艺术。
