All workers in the petroleum industry vow to learn from the heroic 32111 drilling team and swiftly launch a campaign to study the heroes' noble qualities.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, the heroic deeds of the 32111 drilling team, who braved fire and danger to rescue a gas well with their blood and lives, have deeply moved all workers in the petroleum industry. They have received profound education from the heroes' deeds in Mao Zedong Thought, swiftly launching a campaign to study the heroes' noble qualities. They are determined to be like the heroes, using the deepest class sentiments and the most tenacious revolutionary will, to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, to make reading Chairman Mao's books their first need in life, to make Mao Zedong Thought their soul, to make executing Chairman Mao's instructions their conscious action, and to regard revolutionary interests as their first priority.

The heroic deeds of the 32111 drilling team have been widely known in various petroleum enterprises since late June this year. Units such as the Daqing Oilfield, Shengli Oilfield, Karamay Oilfield, Yumen Petroleum Administration Bureau, Sichuan Petroleum Administration Bureau, and Lanzhou Refinery, upon receiving the materials about the heroes' deeds, immediately conveyed and organized the workers to study and discuss them overnight. Many petroleum workers, with tears in their eyes, studied the heroes' deeds. During the discussions, they spontaneously raised their fists and shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Learn from the brave heroes who sacrificed their lives to save the well!" Zhang Ziyi, a worker from the 32104 drilling team in the Shengli Oilfield, has a low level of education and finds it difficult to write letters. However, he still took nearly half an hour to carefully write a letter of condolence. He said, "Every character I write represents my respect to the heroes; every character I write adds to my strength to learn from the heroes."

Through studying the heroes' deeds, petroleum workers have further felt the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought. Liu Zhengkun, the political instructor of the 1202 drilling team in the Daqing Oilfield, said, "The heroes' shining example shows that fire can destroy steel drilling rigs in a few minutes, but it can never destroy people armed with Mao Zedong Thought!" Yao Jianbin, the famous driver of the "Hard-Boned" drilling team, said, "The workers of the 32111 team, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, think of the Party's cause and the people's interests, so their hearts are redder than fire and stronger than steel. Learning from the heroes, we must love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought even more, make reading Chairman Mao's books our first need in life, read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime, reform our thoughts for a lifetime, and do revolution for a lifetime."

Petroleum workers across the country have all expressed that learning from the heroes means taking action, first ensuring that our thoughts are red, and thus definitely turning our love for the heroes and our mourning for the martyrs into actual actions and into a driving force. They vow to be like the brave heroes, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to use the most tenacious perseverance and willpower to complete all tasks assigned by the Party more quickly and better, and to continuously achieve new victories on both the spiritual and material fronts.

    石油工业战线全体职工誓以32111英雄钻井队为榜样
    迅速掀起学习英雄高贵品质的热潮
    据新华社二十八日讯　英雄的32111钻井队赴汤蹈火，用鲜血和生命抢救气井的事迹传出以后，立刻震动了整个石油工业战线的全体职工。他们从英雄们的事迹中受到了最深刻的毛泽东思想的教育，迅速掀起了一个学习英雄高贵品质的热潮。他们决心要像英雄一样，用最深厚的阶级感情，最顽强的革命意志，活学活用毛主席著作，把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席的指示变为自觉的行动，把革命利益当成自己的第一生命。
    32111英雄钻井队可歌可泣的事迹，早在今年六月下旬就传遍了各个石油企业。大庆油田、胜利油田、克拉玛依油田、玉门油矿、四川石油管理局、兰州炼油厂等单位，在接到刊载英雄事迹的材料后，都是连夜传达，连夜组织职工学习讨论。许多石油工业职工含着热泪学习了英雄事迹，在座谈讨论中情不自禁地振臂高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“向舍身救井的勇士们学习！”胜利油田32104钻井队工人张子义文化低，写信很困难，但是他还是花了将近半个钟头，工工整整地写了一封慰问信。他说：“我写一个字，就代表我向英雄们致敬的一分心意；我写一个字，就增加我向英雄们学习的一分力量。”
    石油工业职工通过学习英雄们的事迹，进一步感受到了毛泽东思想的无比威力。大庆油田1202钻井队的指导员刘正坤说：“英雄们的光辉榜样说明，烈火可以在几分钟内摧毁钢铁井架，但是永远摧毁不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人！”著名的硬骨头钻井队司机姚建纲说：“用毛泽东思想武装起来的32111队职工，他们想的是党的事业，人民的利益，所以他们的心比火还红，比钢还强。学习英雄，我们就要像英雄一样，更加热爱毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想，把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要，读一辈子毛主席的书，改造一辈子思想，干一辈子革命。”
    全国石油工业战线的职工都纷纷表示：学英雄，看行动，首先作到思想红，因而一定要把对英雄的热爱、对烈士们的悼念，转化为实际行动，变成前进的动力。他们发誓要像勇士们一样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用最顽强的毅力和最顽强的意志，去更快更好地完成党交给的一切任务，在精神和物质两条战线上不断夺取新胜利。
