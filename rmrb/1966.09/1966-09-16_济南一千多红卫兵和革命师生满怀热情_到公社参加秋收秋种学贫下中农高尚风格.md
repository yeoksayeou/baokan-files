	With calloused hands, firm stance, tanned skin, and reddened thoughts,
	Over a thousand Red Guards and revolutionary students from Jinan,
	Full of enthusiasm, go to the commune to participate in autumn harvest and planting,
	Learning from poor and lower-middle peasants' noble style.

	Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 14th — Over 1,500 Red Guards and revolutionary students from Jinan recently went to the suburban communes to help the production teams with autumn harvest and planting.

	After the People's Daily editorial "Grasp the Revolution, Promote Production" was published, Red Guards and revolutionary students in Jinan studied and discussed it earnestly. They posted big-character posters, expressing their determination to go to the countryside to help the production teams with autumn harvest and planting. Some schools immediately organized teams to go down to the countryside. Before they departed, they reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on the necessity for intellectuals to integrate with the workers and peasants. When they went down to the countryside, they all carried Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points" with them.

	The Red Guards and revolutionary students lived and worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants, helping them to harvest and transport crops, and to prepare the land and plant seeds urgently. During breaks in the fields and in the evenings, they studied Chairman Mao's works with the commune members, sang revolutionary songs, and propagated the "Sixteen Points" to the commune members. They also visited the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, asking them to share their family histories, village histories, and their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

	The Red Guards and revolutionary students were deeply moved by seeing the poor and lower-middle peasants carrying Chairman Mao's quotations to the fields to study and apply them in their work. They were inspired by the poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love, faith, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought, and vowed to study and apply Chairman Mao's works just like the poor and lower-middle peasants. In their work, they paid great attention to learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants' spirit of hard work, simplicity, and dedication to revolutionary farming. Some students recorded their gains from this down-to-the-countryside labor with the poem: "Calloused hands, firm stance, tanned skin, and reddened thoughts."

	The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants gave high praise to the Red Guards and revolutionary students for their high revolutionary enthusiasm in going down to the countryside to participate in autumn harvest and planting. They expressed their warmest support for their revolutionary actions.

    磨硬了手掌  站稳了立场  晒黑了皮肤  炼红了思想
    济南一千多红卫兵和革命师生满怀热情
    到公社参加秋收秋种学贫下中农高尚风格
    新华社济南十四日电济南市一千五百多名红卫兵和革命师生最近到郊区帮助公社生产队秋收秋种。
    《人民日报》社论《抓革命，促生产》发表后，济南市红卫兵和革命师生认真进行了学习和讨论，纷纷贴出大字报，表示要到农村帮助公社生产队秋收秋种。一些学校立即组成了下乡参加秋收的队伍。他们出发以前，重温了毛主席有关知识分子必须和工农群众相结合的教导。他们下乡时，都随身带着毛主席著作和“十六条”。
    下乡的红卫兵和革命师生跟贫农下中农同住、同劳动，和社员一起抢收抢运，整地抢种。在田间休息的时候和晚上，他们就跟社员一起学习毛主席著作，唱革命歌曲，向社员宣传十六条。他们还登门拜访，请贫农下中农讲家史、村史，谈活学活用毛主席著作的体会。
    红卫兵和革命师生在劳动中看到贫农下中农带着毛主席语录牌到田间学习，活学活用。他们被贫农下中农对毛泽东思想的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的感情所深深感动，表示一定要像贫农下中农那样活学活用毛主席著作。他们在劳动中还十分注意学习贫农下中农不怕苦、不怕累，勤劳朴素，为革命种田的高尚思想品质。有的学生用“磨硬了手掌，站稳了立场，晒黑了皮肤，炼红了思想”的诗句，记下了同学们这次下乡劳动的收获。
    对红卫兵和革命师生以高度的革命热情下乡参加秋收秋种，广大贫农下中农予以热情的赞扬，并表示最热烈地支持他们的革命行动。（附图片）
