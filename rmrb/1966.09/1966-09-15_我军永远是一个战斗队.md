Our army will forever be a fighting force. Chairman Mao taught us long before national victory, "The People's Liberation Army will forever be a fighting force. Even after national victory, during the historical period when classes have not been eliminated domestically and imperialism exists internationally, our army will still be a fighting force. There must be no misunderstanding or wavering on this point."

Every comrade in our army must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget the enemy, always being ready for battle.

How can we achieve this? What is the best way to prepare for war?

Today's report in our newspaper about a certain regiment strengthening its war preparedness is a good answer.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out that emphasizing politics is the fundamental way to prepare for smashing the imperialist aggression of the United States.

The experience of this regiment once again proves that only by emphasizing politics, by vigorously promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, by focusing on class struggle, by focusing on the ideological transformation of people, and by establishing the idea of a fighting force, can we correctly prepare for war.

Whether or not to emphasize politics, whether or not to engage in class struggle, whether or not to transform people's ideology, is the fundamental issue in preparing for war. This is essentially a question of attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, a struggle between two military thoughts, two military lines, and two military principles of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a reflection of class struggle.

The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to smash bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology; it is a great revolution to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to promote the ideological transformation of people; it is a fundamental measure to prevent and oppose revisionism, and it is the greatest and best war preparedness.

We must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works in this cultural revolution. Especially, we must study Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle, on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, and on people's war and people's army. We must strive to raise proletarian consciousness, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's military thoughts and military line, and firmly establish the idea of forever being a fighting force.

We must follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee, never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget emphasizing politics, and never forget holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly guard our battle positions, maintain high alert, and be ready at any time to smash any sudden attack by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, to defend our great socialist motherland, and to defend our iron proletarian state.

### 我军永远是一个战斗队

    我军永远是一个战斗队
    毛主席早在全国胜利前夕，就教导我们：“人民解放军永远是一个战斗队。就是在全国胜利以后，在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们的军队还是一个战斗队。对于这一点不能有任何的误解和动摇。”
    我军每个同志，都应当牢记毛主席这一教导，时刻不忘敌人，随时准备打仗。
    怎样才能做到这一点呢？什么才是最好的战备呢？
    今天本报关于某团加强战备教育的报道，就是一个很好的回答。
    林彪同志指出，突出政治，是做好粉碎美帝国主义侵略战争准备的根本。
    这个团的经验再次证明，只有大力突出政治，大力开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，大抓阶级斗争，大抓人的思想革命化，大立战斗队思想，才是做好战备工作的唯一正确的途径。
    搞不搞突出政治，搞不搞阶级斗争，搞不搞人的思想革命化，是能否搞好战备的根本问题。这实质上是对待毛泽东思想的根本态度问题，是无产阶级和资产阶级两种建军思想、两条建军路线、两个建军方针的斗争，是阶级斗争的反映。
    当前这场无产阶级文化大革命，是大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想的大革命；是活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化的大革命；是防修反修的根本措施，也是最大最好的战备。
    我们一定要在这场文化大革命中，认真地活学活用毛主席著作。特别是学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论，关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的理论，关于人民战争和人民军队的理论。我们要努力提高无产阶级觉悟，坚决贯彻毛主席的建军思想和建军路线，牢固地树立永远是一个战斗队的思想。
    我们一定要遵照党中央的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。
    我们一定要听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，坚守战斗岗位，保持高度戒备，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的任何突然进攻，保卫我们伟大的社会主义祖国，保卫我们无产阶级铁打的江山。
