In the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers on the financial and commercial front have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasped the revolution, promoted production, and applied the revolutionary enthusiasm ignited in the cultural revolution to the current work of procuring agricultural and sideline products. This has led to an unprecedentedly excellent situation in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products nationwide. By September 20, the amount of grain entering storage had increased by 4% compared to the same period last year, the procurement volume of cotton had increased by 57.8% compared to the same period last year, the procurement volume of flue-cured tobacco had increased by 41.7% compared to the same period last year, and the procurement volume of hemp products had also increased compared to the same period last year. The procurement situation for oil crops such as peanuts and sesame, as well as other agricultural and sideline products, is also very good. The quality of the various agricultural and sideline products that have been procured is generally better than last year.

This autumn's harvest is a bumper year. The autumn grain yield is better than last year, and cotton, flue-cured tobacco, and autumn oil crops have all seen significant increases in production. The broad masses of commune members, through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the socialist education movement, have greatly enhanced their socialist consciousness. Their enthusiasm for selling grain for the revolution, selling cotton for the revolution, and selling agricultural and sideline products for the revolution is unprecedentedly high. Some poor and lower-middle peasants said passionately, "What we are selling is not just grain and cotton; we are selling millions of hearts that love Chairman Mao and the Party."

Facing this situation, various levels of party committees have further strengthened their leadership over procurement work, especially political and ideological leadership over the financial and commercial departments. They have educated the broad masses of financial and commercial workers to understand the situation, regard procurement work as an important political task at present, and grasp it early, tightly, finely, and solidly. The financial and commercial departments at the provincial and prefectural levels, according to Chairman Mao's instructions on grasping the revolution and promoting production, have established two sets of cadres, with one hand grasping the cultural revolution and the other hand grasping procurement work, ensuring double victories in the cultural revolution and procurement work. The financial and commercial departments at the county level and below have concentrated their forces to launch annihilation battles and have thrown themselves into the peak season of procuring agricultural and sideline products with all their might. In the procurement work, the broad masses of financial and commercial workers have emphasized politics and emphasized Mao Zedong Thought, better implemented Chairman Mao's teachings that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and the instruction to "develop the economy and ensure supply." They have strengthened their political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint, further faced the countryside, faced production, and faced the masses, ensuring the completion of the state's procurement tasks for agricultural and sideline products more, faster, better, and more economically.

In the procurement practice, the broad masses of financial and commercial workers have deeply realized that to do a good job in procurement work, the most fundamental thing is to persist in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They have persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works even when the tasks are heavy during the peak season, further establishing the thought of dedicating oneself to the revolution and to the people, and organizing the sale of products in depth.

In the procurement work, the financial and commercial departments have fully trusted and relied on the masses, followed the mass line, and ensured the completion of the procurement tasks for agricultural and sideline products more, faster, better, and more economically with the concern and support of the broad masses of commune members. In the concentrated production areas of cotton, oil, tobacco leaves, and hemp, the financial and commercial departments, according to Chairman Mao's teachings on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" and the latest instructions on turning various industries into revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, have broken through conservative thinking and old frameworks, and enthusiastically helped production teams establish various initial processing factories to process cotton, oil, tobacco, and hemp and other agricultural and sideline products by themselves.

Currently, the procurement work for agricultural and sideline products has entered the peak season. The broad masses of financial and commercial workers are full of spirit and high morale, determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and do an even better job in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products.

    今年秋收丰产年景已定  农副产品收购形势大好
    广大社员为革命交售农副产品积极性空前高涨
    本报讯　在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，财贸战线广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，把在文化革命中焕发起来的革命干劲，用到当前农副产品收购工作中去，使全国农副产品收购出现一派空前未有的大好形势。到九月二十日，粮食入库数量比去年同期增加百分之四，棉花收购量比去年同期增加百分之五十七点八，烤烟收购量比去年同期增加百分之四十一点七，麻类的收购量也比去年同期增加，花生、芝麻等油料作物和其它农副产品的收购情况都很好。已经收购的各种农副产品的质量普遍好于去年。
    今年秋收丰产年景已定。秋粮收成好于去年，棉花、烤烟和秋季油料作物都获得较大幅度增产。广大社员经过活学活用毛主席著作，经过社会主义教育运动，社会主义觉悟大大提高，为革命卖粮、为革命卖棉、为革命交售农副产品的积极性空前高涨。有的贫下中农满怀激情地说：“我们交的不仅仅是粮和棉，我们交的是千万颗热爱毛主席、热爱党的红心。”
    面对这种形势，各级党委进一步加强了对收购工作的领导，特别是加强了对财贸部门的政治思想领导，教育广大财贸职工认清形势，把收购工作作为当前一项重要的政治任务，抓早，抓紧，抓细，抓实。各省、地两级财贸部门根据毛主席关于抓革命、促生产的指示，建立了两套班子，一手抓文化革命，一手抓收购工作，保证文化革命和收购工作双胜利。县以下各级财贸部门集中力量打歼灭战，全力以赴投入旺季农副产品收购。广大财贸职工在收购工作中，大力突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，更好地执行毛主席关于农业是国民经济的基础的教导和“发展经济，保障供给”的指示，加强了政治观点、生产观点、群众观点，进一步面向农村、面向生产、面向大众，保证更多、更快、更好、更省地完成国家农副产品收购任务。
    广大财贸职工在收购实践中，深刻地认识到，要做好收购工作，最根本最重要的是坚持活学活用毛主席著作。他们在旺季大忙中，做到任务越重越是坚持学习毛主席著作，进一步树立了一心为革命、一心为人民的思想，深入生产队组织交售。
    在收购工作中，财贸部门充分信任群众，依靠群众，大走群众路线，使收购工作得到了广大社员群众的关心和支持，保证了又多、又快、又好、又省地完成农副产品收购任务。在棉花、油料、烟叶、麻类等的集中产区，财贸部门根据毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导和关于各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的最新指示，打破保守思想和旧框框，满腔热情地帮助生产队建立各种初制加工厂，由生产队自行加工棉花、油料、烟麻等农副产品。
    当前，农副产品收购工作已经进入大旺季节，广大财贸职工意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把农副产品收购工作做得好上加好。
