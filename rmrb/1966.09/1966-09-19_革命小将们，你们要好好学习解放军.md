In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the Red Guards have enthusiastically responded to the call of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, becoming the vanguard of this revolutionary movement. You dare to think, dare to speak, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel. You have struck down those in power who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois "authorities," those bloodsucking leeches and parasites, making them fall flat on their backs. You have smashed to pieces all the dregs left over from the old society, making the oppressed classes feel proud and joyful. This makes me, an old poor peasant of sixty-eight, feel proud and delighted. The revolutionary cause of the proletariat, with you young revolutionaries as its successors, makes the older generation feel relieved and proud.

Chairman Mao said: "There is no such thing in the world as love without reason, nor is there any hatred without reason." Everyone who has suffered exploitation and oppression knows whom to love and whom to hate; what to love and what to hate. In 1940, the year Ouyang Hai was born, the dog of a village chief tied up Hai's elder brother and took him away. Hai's mother carried the newly born Hai in her arms to beg for food. At the age of seven, Hai took his younger brothers, Ouyang Hu and Ouyang Zengzhi, to beg for food to support their mother. One day, the evil landlord let loose a vicious dog that bit Hai's feet, making them bleed profusely. Hai returned home and said, "Father, Mother, I would rather starve to death than beg for food from the rich. I will pick up firewood to sell and work to support you." From a young age, Hai's heart was filled with class hatred and resentment. He deeply detested and hated all systems of exploitation and all exploiting classes, vowing to fight them to the death.

Hai had such deep hatred for the class enemies and the old society. However, he had boundless love for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, his class brothers, and the working people. He followed Chairman Mao's teachings, always safeguarding the interests of the people, strictly observing the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention, never wasting any state property, and never damaging anything belonging to the people. Once, he helped farmers pick tea leaves, climbing steep cliffs and pushing through thorny bushes, not caring if his face, hands, and arms were scratched and cut, insisting on picking all the tea leaves clean. Someone said, "A few tea leaves aren't worth all this trouble." Hai replied, "If even one tea leaf belonging to the people rots in the mountains, I won't feel at ease!" Yes, Hai was like this from a young age. Because he had suffered hardships and done hard work, he knew how hard it was to get every grain of rice and every thread of cloth. Therefore, he would never damage anything. For the sake of safeguarding the interests of the people and the interests of the Party and the state, he was even willing to sacrifice his life. His glorious life vividly proved this.

Young revolutionaries, the People's Liberation Army is the model for the whole nation to learn from. We must study the PLA well and always be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. We must take the PLA as our model, resolutely carry out the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention formulated by Chairman Mao, and always safeguard the interests of the people. We must unite with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, humbly learn from them, learn their hardworking and arduous struggle spirit, learn their simple and modest style, learn their revolutionary qualities of being ruthless to the enemy and lenient to themselves, and learn their high sense of organization and discipline.

I sincerely hope that in the great storms of class struggle, you will face the wind and rain, gain experience, and study Mao Zedong Thought diligently, master it, and apply it well. Strive to train yourselves to become revolutionary fighters of the proletariat like Hai. (Attached is a picture)

We will forever be Chairman Mao's little red soldiers.

    革命小将们，你们要好好学习解放军
    伟大的共产主义战士欧阳海的父亲　欧阳恒文
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命斗争中，红卫兵小将们热烈响应我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的号召，成为这场革命运动的急先锋。你们敢想、敢说、敢于革命、敢于造反，把那些走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级“权威”老爷们，把那些吸血鬼、寄生虫，打得人仰马翻；把旧社会遗留下来的一切残渣剩屑，砸得粉碎。你们灭了剥削阶级的威风，长了无产阶级的革命志气，使我这个六十八岁的老贫农，感到扬眉吐气，心花怒放。我们无产阶级的革命事业，有了你们这班英勇无畏的革命小将们来继承，使老一辈人感到宽心和自豪。
    毛主席说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”一切深受剥削和压迫的人，都知道应该爱谁，应该恨谁；应该爱什么，应该恨什么。一九四○年，就是欧阳海出生的那一年，狗保长把海子的大哥五花大绑抓走了。海子的妈把刚出生的海子揣在怀里去讨饭。海子七岁，就带着弟弟欧阳湖和欧阳增智讨饭养活妈妈。一天，万恶的地主放出恶狗，把海子的两只脚咬得鲜血直流。海子回到家里说：“爹呀！妈呀！我饿死也不到富人家讨饭了；我捡柴卖，我做工来养活您们。”小海的心灵里，从小就埋下了阶级的仇和恨，他对一切剥削制度，一切剥削阶级，深恶痛绝，不共戴天。
    海子对阶级敌人，对旧社会是那样深恶痛绝。但是他对共产党，对毛主席，对自己的阶级兄弟，对劳动人民，却是无限热爱。他按照毛主席的教导，处处维护人民群众的利益，最严格地遵守三大纪律八项注意，从来不糟踏一点国家的财富，不糟踏一点群众的东西。有一次，他帮农民摘茶子，攀悬岩、钻刺蓬，不顾脸、手、胳膊被刺划破，硬要把茶子摘干净。有人说，一两颗茶子值不得这样搞。海子回答说：“让群众的一颗茶子烂在山里，我心里不安！”是的，海子从小就是这样，因为他受过苦，干过活，知道一粒粮、一根线，都来得不容易，所以他绝不损毁一点东西。他为了维护群众的利益，维护党和国家的利益，甚至可以不惜牺牲自己的生命。他的光辉的一生，就生动地证明了这一点。
    革命的青少年们，中国人民解放军是全国人民学习的榜样，我们一定要好好学习解放军永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民的崇高品质。我们要以解放军为榜样，坚决执行毛主席亲手制定的三大纪律八项注意，处处维护群众利益。要与工农兵群众相结合，虚心向工农兵学习，学习他们的勤劳和艰苦奋斗的作风，学习他们朴实和谦逊的作风，学习他们对敌狠、对己和的革命品质，学习他们高度的组织性和纪律性。
    我衷心希望你们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，经风雨，见世面，努力学习毛泽东思想，掌握毛泽东思想，运用好毛泽东思想，把自己锻炼成为像海子那样的一名无产阶级革命战士。（附图片）
   我们永远做毛主席的红色小兵
