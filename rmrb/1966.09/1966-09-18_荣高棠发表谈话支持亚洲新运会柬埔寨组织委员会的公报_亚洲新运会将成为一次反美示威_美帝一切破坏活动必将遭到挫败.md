Rong Gao Tang, Chairman of the Chinese Preparatory Committee for the First Asian New Forces Games, stated to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on September 17th that the ongoing selection competitions for the Chinese teams participating in the First Asian New Forces Games reflect the enthusiastic support of the Chinese people for this event. He said that during the great upheaval of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, athletes armed with the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong have actively participated in this great revolutionary movement and have enthusiastically engaged in the selection competitions with revolutionary spirit. They are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to train diligently and strive for excellent results, and to contribute together with athletes from other countries participating in the Asian New Games to the success of this event.

Rong Gao Tang pointed out that the First Asian New Forces Games is a matter of great concern to the Chinese and Asian peoples, and it is also a matter of great interest to the world's people. It will greatly promote the unity and anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of Asian countries, enhance friendships, and develop the sports affairs of the peoples of Asian countries. According to the host country of this event, Cambodia, by August 31st, sports organizations from sixteen countries and regions have confirmed their participation in this event. This is another heavy blow to the U.S. imperialism and its lackeys who attempt to monopolize international sports activities and discriminate against, interfere with, and sabotage the sports affairs of various countries.

Rong Gao Tang said that the Cambodian National Organizing Committee for the First Asian New Forces Games recently issued a statement saying: "The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys have issued threats against the peoples of the New Forces of Asia, plotting conspiracies to disrupt the unity of the peoples of Asian countries and to sabotage the First Asian New Forces Games. However, we have every reason to believe that the awakened peoples of the New Forces of Asia, with their shared destiny, will unite and strengthen cooperation, encourage and support each other, and thoroughly smash the various conspiracies of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, successfully holding the First Asian New Forces Games as a united anti-imperialist event." The statement also pointed out: "It can be predicted that under these circumstances, the First Asian New Forces Games will demonstrate the shared will of the peoples of Asian countries to unite against U.S. imperialism and will become a demonstration against U.S. imperialism." Rong Gao Tang said that the Chinese people, sports workers, and athletes fully endorse the views expressed in the statement and fully support the efforts of Cambodia to smash the sabotage conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and to successfully hold this united anti-imperialist event.

He said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." Now, imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionaries of various countries, and their tools for monopolizing international sports activities—such as the International Olympic Committee and other reactionary international sports organizations—arrogantly claim to boycott the Asian New Forces Games. However, they are nothing but paper tigers. As long as the peoples and athletes of Asian countries unite, they will definitely shatter their conspiracies and sabotage activities and will definitely hold the First Asian New Forces Games successfully under the spirit of "promoting friendship, mutual progress, common development, and united anti-imperialism"!

    荣高棠发表谈话支持亚洲新运会柬埔寨组织委员会的公报
    亚洲新运会将成为一次反美示威
    美帝一切破坏活动必将遭到挫败
    新华社十七日讯　中华人民共和国参加第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会筹备委员会主席荣高棠十七日对新华社记者说，正在进行的中华人民共和国参加第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会各体育代表队的选拔赛，表明中国人民对这届运动会的热情支持。他说，在我国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，用伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的我国运动员，都积极地参加了这一伟大的革命运动，并以这种革命精神紧张地投入了这一次选拔赛。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，勤学苦练，创造优良的成绩，同参加亚洲新运会的各国运动员一道，为开好这届运动会而共同作出贡献。
    荣高棠指出，第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会是中国人民和亚洲人民关心的一件大事，也是世界人民所注目的一件大事。它对亚洲各国人民团结反帝和增进友谊，发展亚洲各国人民体育事业，将起巨大的推进作用。据这届运动会的东道国——柬埔寨宣布，到八月三十一日为止，已有十六个国家和地区的体育组织表示肯定要参加这届运动会。这是对妄图垄断国际体育活动，歧视、干涉和破坏各国人民的体育事业的美帝国主义及其走狗的又一次沉重的打击。
    荣高棠说，第一届亚洲新运会柬埔寨全国组织委员会最近发表公报说：“美帝国主义者及其走狗发出了反对亚洲新兴力量人民的叫嚣，策划阴谋以破坏亚洲各国人民的团结并对第一届亚洲新运会进行捣乱，破坏这次运动会。但是，我们有充分的理由相信，觉醒了的亚洲新兴力量人民，他们共命运，必将团结一致和加强合作，互相鼓励和互相支持，以彻底粉碎美帝国主义者及其走狗的各种阴谋，成功地举行团结反帝的第一届亚洲新运会。”公报还指出：“可以预言，在这种情况下举行的第一届亚洲新运会定将显示亚洲各国人民团结起来反对美帝国主义的共同意志，并且将成为反对美帝国主义的一次示威。”荣高棠说，中国人民、体育工作者和运动员完全赞成公报表达的这些观点，并且全力支持柬埔寨为粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的破坏阴谋，为开好这次团结反帝的运动会所作出的一切努力。
    他说，毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”现在，帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派以及它们垄断国际体育活动的工具——国际奥林匹克委员会等反动的国际体育组织，狂妄地叫嚣要抵制亚洲新运会。但是他们都不过是纸老虎，只要我们亚洲各国人民和广大运动员团结起来，就一定能击破它们的任何阴谋诡计和破坏活动，就一定会在“增进友好，互相促进，共同发展，团结反帝”的精神下，把第一届亚洲新运会开好！
