Following the Path Indicated by Chairman Mao
— A Record of the Participation of Daqing Oilfield Workers' Families in Industrial and Agricultural Production

Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, has proposed that all sectors should become revolutionary schools that are both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military. This great call has illuminated the path to communism. Daqing Oilfield is built according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Recently, we visited the industrial and agricultural villages of Daqing Oilfield with reverence.

The Path of Revolution

The car sped along the wide road. Countless tall derricks and rows of low oil wells were left behind. On the road, we encountered a group of family members wearing straw hats, maintaining the road surface. Soon, a golden sea of wheat appeared before our eyes. In countless fields, red flags were flying, and groups of women were busily harvesting wheat. Some were driving tractors for autumn plowing. A comrade introduced to us, "These vast fields of crops are mainly planted by the family members. They not only produce grain but also participate in auxiliary industrial labor during the agricultural off-season. They also work in stores, canteens, and nurseries. In short, the family members of Daqing have taken up 'half the sky'!"

In the past, the development of a new mining area would be followed by the emergence of a new city. Large numbers of family members would move from the countryside to the city, detach themselves from labor, and become consumers. The state would have to supply them with grain from other places and set up administrative management and welfare departments to serve them.

The Daqing Oilfield Party Committee, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, firmly implemented the new policy of combining industry with agriculture and cities with the countryside in mining area construction. Instead of building an "oil city" with the development of the oilfield, it established several scattered industrial and agricultural villages around the oilfield. Outside the villages, there are vast farmlands, allowing family members to have land to cultivate. The administrative, production management, and welfare work of the industrial and agricultural villages are as much as possible handled by the family members themselves. Even the various production departments of the oilfield try to absorb some family members to participate in labor.

Now, more than 95% of the family members of Daqing with labor capacity have participated in collective production labor, and some family members have even achieved self-sufficiency in grain and vegetables. This method not only fully mobilizes the labor enthusiasm of the family members of workers, creating material wealth for the accelerated construction of Chinese socialism; it also gradually narrows the gap between workers and peasants, cities and countryside, and manual and mental labor from a political perspective.

The Source of Strength

"Without the sun, the moon cannot shine; without rain, the seedlings will wither. Without studying Chairman Mao's works, the family members' revolution will lose direction." After the family members of Daqing organized themselves, they worked while studying Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought changed their spiritual outlook, making them dare to challenge the old ideas and customs that have existed for thousands of years.

Gao Dongying, a family member from a student background, came to Daqing to find a "leisurely" job. When someone mobilized her to participate in agricultural production, she said, "Who would come here to farm?" Under the influence of the family member model Xue Guifang, after studying Chairman Mao's works, she understood the meaning of farming for the revolution. She decided to try participating in labor. The hard work made her back and legs ache, and she wanted to quit. However, the spirit of her sisters, who created a new world despite numerous setbacks, inspired her. The great spirit of White, who dedicated himself to others and sought no personal gain, encouraged her. She finally went from despising labor to loving it and became a labor model for the entire oilfield.

Li Xiuzhen, from a poor peasant family, was once influenced by the parasitic class's ideas of avoiding hard work. Later, she participated in the "bitter memories, sweet present" activities and studied three of Chairman Mao's brilliant works: "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." In the summer, she was not afraid of the heat and was the first to sign up to build "dry rammed earth" on the grassland; in the winter, she braved the biting north wind and took the initiative to dig toilets and collect fertilizer. Last spring, when the male workers of the production team returned to the industrial front, she stepped forward, learning to plow the fields. To learn how to guide the horse and plow, she was thrown to the ground by the horse three times. She studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and thought, "The Foolish Old Man could move two mountains, why can't I, a young person, guide a plow?" Chairman Mao's words gave her a hundred times more courage. After arduous training, Li Xiuzhen mastered the technique of guiding a horse and plowing. Under her influence, many family members also learned to guide a horse and plow. This spring, without male workers, the family members also planted the fields.

Mao Zedong Thought made Gao Dongying, Li Xiuzhen, and tens of thousands of other family members wise and fearless, transforming their spiritual outlook. They vividly described their ideological changes after studying Chairman Mao's works: "In the past, my eyes saw a room, and my heart thought of my husband and children; now, my eyes see all of China, and my heart thinks of the whole world."

The East Wind Blows Everywhere

The revolutionary family members are not only a great productive force but also a great political force. In the past, some workers and family members had different concerns: "You talk about oil machines, she talks about cotton cloth." But now, proletarian politics are in command, and family relationships have also changed. Sometimes, workers' wrong thoughts just surface, and the party branch members don't know yet, but the family members have already discovered them and fought against them. Zhang Hongchi told us, "The family members have revolutionized, cutting off the retreat of some workers' wrong thoughts, with great power." In their drilling team, a worker did not want to be a squad leader and was criticized by the leadership. When he returned home, he threw things. His wife found out the situation and criticized his wrong thoughts. The next day, the worker returned to the squad and made a self-criticism to the political instructor.

When parents' thoughts are revolutionized, they can educate their children well and cultivate red revolutionary successors. The son of He Dama from the family members' sewing factory once did not want to work on shoe repairs and wanted to go to the mine as an apprentice. After He Dama found out, she called him over and seriously said, "What? Take off your shoes and go for a run outside, then go register." The son said, "Without shoes, how can I go outside?" He Dama said, "You can't go without shoes, then how do the oil workers work without shoes? You don't want to do shoe repairs, and neither does he. Who will do it? Tell me, is shoe repairing a revolutionary job?" A few words left the son speechless, and he no longer looked down on shoe repairing.

The family members participated in labor, and their thoughts were revolutionized, changing people's relationships with each other. Now, when people get together, they talk about ideological changes, compare labor efforts, care about others, and care about the collective. In the 1,400-plus family members of the Oil Construction Command's Contest Village, last year, more than 400 people became five-good family members, and more than 300 couples became "red couples." The greatest significance of Daqing Oilfield organizing family members to participate in collective production and study Chairman Mao's works is to transform people's thoughts, making the broad family members break with their old thoughts and consciousness, becoming new people with communist ideals. The oil model worker Zhang Hongchi summed up this meaning well, saying, "To build communism, we must first have communist ideals. Otherwise, if the material living standards are improved but the ideological level is not high, it will deteriorate!"

    走毛主席指引的路
    ——记大庆油田职工家属参加工农业生产
    我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，提出了各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校。这一伟大号召，照亮了通往共产主义的大道。大庆油田就是按照毛主席的指示办的。最近，我们怀着崇敬的心情，访问了大庆油田的工农村。
    革命化的路
    汽车在宽阔的公路上奔驰。无数高耸的井架和一栋栋低矮的采油井房被抛到后面。路上遇见一队戴着草帽的家属，正在保养路面。不久眼前出现了金光闪闪的麦海，在无数麦田里插着红旗，成群的妇女正在紧张地收割小麦，还有的开着拖拉机进行秋翻作业。一位同志向我们介绍说：“这大片的庄稼主要是职工家属种的。她们不仅生产粮食，而且在农闲时还参加工业辅助劳动。她们也参加商店、食堂、托儿所的工作。总之，大庆的家属顶起了‘半边天’！”
    过去，一个新矿区开发，也就跟着出现一座新城市。大批家属从农村搬到城里，脱离了劳动，变成了消费者。国家要从外地供应给她们粮食，要设置一套行政管理机构和生活福利部门为她们服务。
    大庆油田党委遵照毛主席和党中央的指示，坚决贯彻了工农结合、城乡结合的矿区建设的新方针。它没有随着油田的开发建设“石油城”，而是在油田周围建立了若干分散的工农村。村外有大片农田，使家属有田可种。工农村的行政、生产管理和生活福利工作尽量由家属自己来担任，就连油田的各个生产部门也尽量吸收一部分家属参加劳动。
    现在，大庆已有百分之九十五以上有劳动力的职工家属参加了集体生产劳动，一部分家属并且做到了粮食和菜蔬都能自给。这种办法，不仅充分发挥了职工家属的劳动积极性，为加快我国社会主义建设创造物质财富；也从政治上逐渐缩小了工农差别，城乡差别，体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别。
    力量的源泉
    “月亮离了太阳不能发光，禾苗离了雨水就要枯黄，家属闹革命，不学毛主席著作就要迷失方向。”大庆家属组织起来以后，一面劳动，一面学习毛主席著作。毛泽东思想改变了她们的精神面貌，使她们敢于向几千年来的旧思想、旧风俗进行最大胆的挑战。
    学生出身的家属咼冬英，来大庆是为了找个“清闲”的工作。当有人动员她参加农业生产时，她说：“要是种地谁到这里来！”当她在家属标兵薛桂芳的带动下，学习了毛主席著作，懂得了为革命种地的道理以后，她决心试着参加劳动了。艰苦的劳动，使她腰酸腿疼，想打退堂鼓。但是，姐妹们百折不挠创造新天地的精神鼓舞了她，白求恩专门利人、毫不利己的伟大精神激励着她，她终于由轻视劳动到爱上了劳动，并且成了全油田的劳动能手。
    贫农家庭出身的李秀珍，曾一度沾染上剥削阶级好逸恶劳的思想灰尘。后来，参加了忆苦思甜，学习了《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》和《愚公移山》等三篇毛主席的光辉著作。夏天，她不怕炎热，第一个报名上草滩盖“干打垒”；冬天，她顶着凛冽的北风，主动挖厕所积肥。去年春耕，生产队的男职工都回到了工业战线，她挺身而出，学着扶犁耕地。她为了学会扶马犁，三次被马拖倒在地里。她学习了《愚公移山》，心想：“愚公老人能搬走两座大山，我一个青年人，难道连犁也扶不了？”毛主席的话，使她增加了百倍的勇气。经过刻苦的锻炼，李秀珍掌握了使马扶犁的技术。在她的带动下，许多家属也学会了扶马犁。这年春天，没有男职工，家属也种上了地。
    毛泽东思想使咼冬英、李秀珍以及成千上万的家属变得聪明能干，无所畏惧，精神面貌发生了根本变化。她们生动地描述了学习毛主席著作后的思想转变：“过去眼里看到的是一间房子，心里想的是丈夫和孩子；现在眼里看到的是全中国，心里想的是全世界。”
    到处是东风
    革命化的家属队伍，不仅是一支巨大的生产力量，而且是一支巨大的政治力量。从前，有的职工和家属的关系是：“你说的是石油机器，她说的是毛料哔叽”。但是现在，无产阶级政治挂了帅，家庭关系也发生了变化。有些职工的活思想刚刚露头，党支部的同志还不知道，家属已经发现，并且作了斗争。张洪池告诉我们：“家属革命化了，就把一些职工的错误思想的后路抄了，威力很大。”他们钻井队的一个职工，不愿意当班长，受了领导的批评，回到家里就摔东西。他爱人问明了情况，批评了他的错误思想。第二天，这个工人回到班里向指导员作了检讨。
    做父母的思想革命化了，对孩子就能进行很好的身教言教，就会培养出红色的革命接班人。家属缝补厂何大娘的儿子有一个时期不安心做修鞋工作，老想去矿上当学徒工。何大娘知道以后，就把他叫到跟前严肃地说：“好呀，你把鞋子脱下来，到外面跑一趟，再去报名。”儿子说：“不穿鞋，咋能到外面跑呢？”何大娘说：“你不穿鞋不行，那么石油工人不穿鞋怎么干活？修鞋这工作你不愿干，他也不愿干，叫谁来干？你说一说，修鞋是不是革命工作？”一席话，问得儿子哑口无言，再也不轻视修鞋工作了。
    家属们参加劳动了，思想革命化了，人们互相的关系也变了。现在，大家在一起谈的是思想变化，比的是劳动好坏，关心的是别人，是集体。在油建指挥部争游村一千四百多名家属里，去年就有四百多人当上了五好家属，三百多对夫妇成了“一对红”。大庆油田组织家属参加集体生产劳动，组织家属学习毛主席著作，最伟大的意义是改造了人们的思想，使广大的家属和过去的旧思想、旧意识决裂了，成为具有共产主义思想的新人。石油标兵张洪池把这个意义总结的很好，他说：“要建设共产主义，首先要有共产主义思想。不然，物质生活水平提高了，思想水平不高，就会变质！”　本报记者
