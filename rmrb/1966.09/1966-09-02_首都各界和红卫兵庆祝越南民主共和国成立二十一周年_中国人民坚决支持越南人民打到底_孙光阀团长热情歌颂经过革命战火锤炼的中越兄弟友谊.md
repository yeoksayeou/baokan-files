	Capital circles and Red Guards from various units, totaling more than a thousand people, held a grand meeting this afternoon to enthusiastically celebrate the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Vice Premier Chen Yi attended the meeting. Ambassador Chen Ziping of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, Team Leader Sun Guanguo of the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, and Deputy Team Leader Nguyen Minh Phong of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's permanent delegation to China, as well as Vietnamese friends in Beijing, were invited to attend the meeting.

	Yang Xiufeng, President of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically praising the great achievements of the Vietnamese people in socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, and their brilliant victories in the great struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

	Yang Xiufeng said, "The victories of the Vietnamese people's anti-imperialist struggle over the past decade and their brilliant record in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation have proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's assertion that 'all reactionaries are paper tigers.' Yang Xiufeng said, 'The Chinese people most enthusiastically and resolutely support Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to fight to the end, to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation until they achieve final victory.'

	Yang Xiufeng condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for consistently playing the role of the chief accomplice of American imperialism. He said, "The United States and the Soviet Union are colluding in the Vietnam issue, carrying out 'joint actions' to sabotage the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. Therefore, all countries that genuinely oppose American imperialist aggression must draw a clear line of demarcation with the 'joint actions' that betray the interests of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world."

	Sun Guanguo said in his speech, "Over the past 21 years, the victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in various fields, especially in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, are inseparable from the decisive, powerful, sincere, immense, and precious support of the great 700 million Chinese people. The brotherly friendship between Vietnam and China has been tempered by the fires of revolution."

	He said, "The Vietnamese people will forever remember Chairman Mao Zedong's powerful declaration on August 29, 1963, which strongly supported the struggle of the people of South Vietnam against American aggression and for national salvation. On February 10, 1965, Chairman Mao personally attended a grand meeting in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, which greatly inspired all Vietnamese people to resolutely fight and strive for new victories. On July 22, 1966, Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People's Republic of China issued a declaration supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people. The recent Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China also gave the Vietnamese people the most enthusiastic and resolute support."

	Sun Guanguo mentioned the recent agreement signed by the governments of the two countries regarding economic and technological assistance from the Chinese government to Vietnam. He said, "This agreement embodies the unity and brotherly friendship between the front and the rear. It is the firm support given by the Communist Party of China, the government, and the brotherly Chinese people on the basis of proletarian internationalism."

	The speeches by Yang Xiufeng and Sun Guanguo were met with prolonged, enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. After Sun Guanguo's speech, he presented a banner and fragments of a downed American plane from August 16 of this year to the people of the capital.

    首都各界和红卫兵庆祝越南民主共和国成立二十一周年
    中国人民坚决支持越南人民打到底
    孙光阀团长热情歌颂经过革命战火锤炼的中越兄弟友谊
    据新华社一日讯　首都各界和各单位红卫兵一千多人今天下午隆重集会，热烈庆祝越南民主共和国成立二十一周年。陈毅副总理出席了大会。越南民主共和国驻中国大使陈子平，越中友协代表团团长孙光阀，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳以及在京的越南朋友应邀出席了大会。
    中越友好协会会长杨秀峰在讲话中热烈赞扬越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了巨大成就，在抗美救国的伟大斗争中取得了辉煌胜利。
    杨秀峰说，越南人民十几年来反帝斗争的胜利以及在抗美救国斗争中的光辉战绩，证明了毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断。杨秀峰说，中国人民最热烈、最坚决地支持胡志明主席的号召书，坚决支持越南人民打到底，直到取得抗美救国斗争的最后胜利。
    杨秀峰谴责了苏联修正主义领导集团一直扮演着美帝国主义的头号帮凶的角色。他说，美苏在越南问题上狼狈为奸，大搞“联合行动”，破坏世界各国人民的革命斗争。因此，一切真正反对美帝国主义侵略的国家，必须同出卖越南人民和世界革命人民利益的“联合行动”划清界限。
    孙光阀在讲话中说，二十一年来，越南人民在各个领域中所取得的胜利，特别是在抗美救国斗争事业中的胜利，是和伟大的七亿中国人民的坚决有力、真诚、巨大和珍贵的援助分不开的。越南和中国的兄弟友谊是经过革命战火的锤炼的。
    他说，越南人民永远铭记着毛泽东主席一九六三年八月二十九日发表的强有力地支持越南南方人民抗美救国的斗争的具有历史意义的声明。一九六五年二月十日，毛主席亲自出席了具有历史意义的支持越南人民抗美救国的盛大集会，极大地鼓舞着全体越南人民坚决斗争，为争取新的胜利而奋勇前进。一九六六年七月二十二日中华人民共和国主席刘少奇发表了支持越南人民斗争的声明。最近举行的中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议，又给了越南人民以最热烈、最坚决的支持。
    孙光阀谈到最近越中两国政府签订的关于中国政府给予越南经济技术援助协定，他说，这个协定体现了前方和后方之间的团结战斗的兄弟情谊。这是中国共产党、政府和兄弟的中国人民在无产阶级国际主义的基础上所给予的坚决支持。
    杨秀峰和孙光阀的讲话，引起全场长时间的热烈的掌声。孙光阀团长讲话以后，向首都人民赠送了锦旗和今年八月十六日越南人民在河内打下的美国飞机的残骸碎片。
