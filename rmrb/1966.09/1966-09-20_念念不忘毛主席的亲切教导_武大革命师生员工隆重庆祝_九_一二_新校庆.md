The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Wuhan University solemnly celebrated the new anniversary of "September 12," never forgetting Chairman Mao's warm instructions and care.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 19th - On September 12, 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected Wuhan University. This was the most brilliant day in the history of Wuhan University. The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Wuhan University never forget this most meaningful day, always thinking of Chairman Mao's warm instructions and care, and decided to set this day as the new anniversary day.

	On this day, Wuhan University held a grand celebration meeting with more than ten thousand people participating. The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff held high portraits of Chairman Mao, carried red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and carried large "joy" characters to the square where Chairman Mao met with teachers, students, and staff on September 12, 1958. They cheered, jumped, and continuously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

	Eight years ago on this day, Chairman Mao inspected the factory run by young students of Wuhan University. The warm care and instructions given by Chairman Mao during the inspection greatly inspired all the revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan University. However, after 1961, a small group of capitalist-roaders led by the anti-party, anti-socialist rightist Li Da usurped the leadership of Wuhan University. They opposed Mao Zedong Thought, opposed the Party's educational policies, and ruthlessly suppressed the spirit of the 1958 educational revolution, persecuting revolutionary leftists, and destroyed the chemical factory that Chairman Mao had inspected. Their dark hands could not cover the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan University, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, exposed Li Da and others, making Wuhan University see the light again.

	At the celebration meeting, all the revolutionary teachers and students unanimously pledged to the most beloved leader Chairman Mao: to care about state affairs and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Wang Renhe, the First Secretary of the Central-South Bureau of the Communist Party of China, sent a telegram from Beijing, sincerely supporting the decision of the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Wuhan University to set the day when the most beloved leader Chairman Mao inspected Wuhan University for the educational revolution as the new anniversary of Wuhan University. He encouraged the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Wuhan University to use Mao Zedong Thought as their guide and the "Sixteen Points" personally led and formulated by Chairman Mao as their weapon, to push the cultural revolution of "One Struggle, Two Lines, and Three Changes" to a new high tide.

	Factory workers and poor and lower-middle peasants from the countryside specially rushed to Wuhan University to celebrate the new anniversary of Wuhan University with the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff. Some revolutionary teachers and students from the capital and other brother provinces and cities who were conducting revolutionary exchanges, representatives from some brother institutions in the Wuhan area, and representatives from Vietnamese students studying in China participated in the celebration.

    念念不忘毛主席的亲切教导
    武大革命师生员工隆重庆祝“九·一二”新校庆
    据新华社武汉十九日电　一九五八年九月十二日，我们的伟大领袖毛主席视察了武汉大学。这是武汉大学历史上最光辉灿烂的一日。武大革命师生员工念念不忘这个最有意义的日子，时刻想念着毛主席的亲切教导和关怀，决定把这一天订为新校庆纪念日。
    这一天，武汉大学举行了有一万多人参加的盛大的庆祝大会。革命师生员工高举毛主席像，拿着鲜红的《毛主席语录》，抬着大“喜”字，来到毛主席一九五八年九月十二日会见师生员工的广场。他们欢呼、跳跃，不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    八年前的这天，毛主席视察了武汉大学由青年学生自己办起来的工厂。毛主席在视察中给予的亲切关怀和教导，使武大全体革命师生受到巨大的鼓舞。可是，一九六一年以后，以反党反社会主义的右派分子李达为首的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，篡夺了武汉大学的领导权，他们反对毛泽东思想，反对党的教育方针，疯狂地扼杀一九五八年教育革命精神，打击迫害革命左派，把毛主席视察过的化工厂毁掉了。他们的黑手终究遮不住毛泽东思想的光辉。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，武大革命师生高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把李达等揪了出来，使武汉大学重见阳光。
    在庆祝大会上，全校革命师生一致向最敬爱的领袖毛主席保证：要关心国家大事，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    中共中央中南局第一书记王任重同志从北京拍来贺电，衷心拥护武大革命师生员工决定把最敬爱的领袖毛主席到武大视察教育革命的日子，订为新武大校庆。他勉励武大革命师生员工，以毛泽东思想为指南，以毛主席亲自领导制定的十六条为武器，把一斗二批三改的文化大革命推向一个新的高潮。
    工厂工人和农村贫下中农代表特地赶到武汉大学同革命师生员工一起庆祝新武大校庆。来自首都和其它兄弟省市进行革命串连的部分革命师生，武汉地区部分兄弟院校代表和越南留学生代表参加了庆祝会。
