In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have deeply felt that without the revolutionary theory of Mao Zedong Thought, there would be no revolutionary action. To be a revolutionary vanguard in the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

I am a young lathe operator. When the Proletarian Cultural Revolution just began, I had a very poor understanding of its significance, my political sense was dull, and I could not keep up with the situation.

As the Cultural Revolution developed, the lid of class struggle in our factory was lifted. This caused a great shock to my thoughts. What was going on? With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there still remain enemies without guns. They will inevitably struggle to the death with us, and we must not underestimate these enemies." Chairman Mao's words were like a red lamp lighting up my heart, making me understand the law of class struggle in socialist society. The class enemies we have overthrown are not willing to admit defeat. They always look for opportunities to try to overthrow the socialist system. This current Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. I am a poor child. Without the Party and Chairman Mao, how could I have gone to school and entered the factory! Today, whoever wants to drag us back, I will fight to the end with him. I also realized that this Cultural Revolution is a great matter concerning the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. All revolutionary comrades should join the revolutionary torrent.

Just as one problem was solved, another arose. Many comrades exposed and criticized those in power who were taking the capitalist road. However, I knew little about the situation and did not know what to do, which was really frustrating. I again turned to Chairman Mao's works for guidance. Chairman Mao taught us: "The people rely on us to organize them. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them." Chairman Mao's words increased my fighting spirit and revolutionary enthusiasm. I thought, in our workshop, there are many foremen who have been in the factory for a long time and know more about the situation. So, I went to them to understand the situation and together we analyzed and studied it. Some foremen were not good at writing, so I helped them write big-character posters and materials. In this way, by fully relying on the masses, we fought and exposed the true face of those in power who were taking the capitalist road.

Just as we were fighting fiercely against the class enemies, a situation arose in our workshop where some young workers were fighting against other young workers. What should we do? I again found the solution in Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question for the revolution." I thought, in this complex environment, we must distinguish between enemies and ourselves and correctly handle the contradictions within the people and those between us and the enemy. There are problems and opinions among the workers, which should be handled as contradictions within the people. We must not mix the two types of contradictions together. In this way, I did ideological work with the relevant comrades and suggested that the youth league branch hold a life meeting to solve this problem. Through mutual help among comrades, everyone unified their understanding and concentrated their efforts to fight against our common class enemy, making the Cultural Revolution in our factory advance vigorously.

In the future, I will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works more thoroughly, study the Sixteen Points, be familiar with the Sixteen Points, master the Sixteen Points, and use the Sixteen Points. Only in this way can I fight better in the Cultural Revolution.

    斗争·学习·前进
    青年工人　王燕芳
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我深深地体会到：没有毛泽东思想的革命理论，就没有革命的行动。要在无产阶级文化大革命中当一名革命闯将，就必须读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    我是一个青年车工。在无产阶级文化大革命刚开始时，我对这场文化大革命的意义认识得很不够，政治嗅觉不灵，跟不上形势。
    随着文化大革命的逐步发展，我们厂里的阶级斗争盖子也被揭开了。这在我思想上引起了很大的震动。这是怎么一回事呢？我带着这个问题去学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”毛主席的话像盏红灯照亮了我的心，使我懂得了社会主义社会阶级斗争的规律。被我们打倒的阶级敌人是不甘心失败的，他们总是千方百计地寻找机会，妄想推翻社会主义制度。目前这一场文化大革命，就是无产阶级和资产阶级的你死我活的斗争。我是一个苦孩子。要是没有党，没有毛主席，我怎能上学、进工厂！今天谁想拉我们走回头路，我就要和他拚到底。我还理解到，这场文化大革命是关系到中国革命和世界革命的大事，所有革命的同志都应该投入革命的洪流。
    一个问题刚刚解决，另一个问题又来了。许多同志都对走资本主义道路的当权派进行揭发和批判。但是，我了解情况少，不知该怎么办，真是干着急。我又带着这些问题去请教毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。”毛主席的话增加了我的战斗信心和革命干劲。我想，我们车间里有好些老师傅在厂时间长，知道情况多。于是，我就向他们了解情况，并和他们一起进行分析和研究。有些老师傅不大会写字，我就帮助他们写大字报、写材料。这样，充分依靠群众，进行斗争，就把走资本主义道路的当权派的反党反社会主义的真面目暴露出来了。
    正当我们和阶级敌人斗争得热火朝天的时候，我们车间里却出现了一部分青年工人斗另一部分青年工人的情况。怎么办呢？我又从毛主席的著作中获得了解决问题的办法。毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”我想，我们在复杂的环境里一定要分清敌我，正确地处理人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾。工人内部有问题，有意见，应该按照人民内部矛盾处理。我们千万不能把两类矛盾混在一起。这样，我就分别作了有关同志的思想工作，并建议团支部召开生活会来解决这个问题。通过同志们相互帮助，大家统一了认识，集中力量向我们共同的阶级敌人开火，使我厂的文化大革命轰轰烈烈地向前发展。
    今后，我一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条。只有这样，才能在文化大革命中更好地战斗。
