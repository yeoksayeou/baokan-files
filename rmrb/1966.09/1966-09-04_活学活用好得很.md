	Learning and Applying is Excellent
	Soldier Liu Weifeng

	I am a new soldier with a low level of education. However, I feel that learning and applying the teachings of Chairman Mao is excellent. For example, Chairman Mao's works are like a powerful power source, our minds are like a lamp, and learning and applying is like the switch. We have an inexhaustible power source, but if we do not turn on the switch, our thoughts will still not be enlightened.

	In February of this year, our company conducted a 600-mile mobile field training exercise. Initially, I lacked confidence. I thought: At home, the farthest I ever walked was about ten miles, and this time it increased by several tens of times, could I make it? The comrade who paired with me, Luo Xin, saw that my spirits were low and said to me, "Little Liu, don't be afraid. Chairman Mao teaches us to despise the enemy strategically and take the enemy seriously tactically. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's words, we will definitely be able to complete the march." During the march, the political instructor and Luo Xin came to help me study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Serve the People." As I studied, I thought: Comrade Zhang Zedong was a Red Army soldier who participated in the Long March. He originally did not know how to make charcoal, but the Party assigned him to make charcoal, and he faced the difficulties head-on, happily making charcoal, and ultimately sacrificed his life. Dr. Norman Bethune was a foreigner who traveled thousands of miles to China. For the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, he sacrificed his life. Chairman Mao highly praised his internationalist and communist spirit and urged us to learn from him and become a person who is "selfless and dedicated to others." I used Zhang Zedong's "complete" and "thorough," and Norman Bethune's "pure" and "noble" as a measure for myself. Instantly, I felt my thoughts enlightened. I thought, I am the son of a poor peasant, and I joined the army to serve the people. To serve the people, can I be afraid of hardship? Can I be intimidated by difficulties? Thinking of this, I made up my mind to work hard on the "application." The next day, as I walked, I felt a headache, but I thought that serving the people means persevering in the struggle and overcoming difficulties. I gritted my teeth and persevered in training. Although my feet were blistered, my thoughts were ignited. Afterwards, no matter how great the difficulties, I could use Chairman Mao's words to examine myself, urge myself forward, and resolutely take the lead.

### 活学活用好得很

    活学活用好得很
    战士　刘维凤
    我是一个新战士，文化水平也低。但是，我感觉活学活用就是好得很。打个比方说，毛主席著作好比强大的电源，我们的头脑好比一盏灯，活学活用好比是电门。我们有永远用不尽的电源，要是不去打开电门，我们的思想还是亮不了。
    今年二月间，我们连进行六百多里的移动野营训练，我开始信心不足。心想：在家最远一次才走十几里地，这一次增加好几十倍，能走得了吗？和我结成“一对红”的罗信同志看我情绪不高，就对我说：“小刘，别害怕，毛主席教导我们在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人。我们只要照毛主席的话去做，就一定能走下来。”行军途中，指导员和罗信同志又来帮我学习《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》和《为人民服务》。我一边学，一边想：张思德同志是参加过长征的红军战士，他原来不懂得怎样烧炭，党派他去烧炭，他就迎着困难前进，愉快地去烧炭，最后光荣牺牲。白求恩大夫是个外国人，不远万里来到中国，为了中国人民的解放事业，最后献出了自己的生命。毛主席对他这种国际主义、共产主义的精神，给予高度的评价，要我们大家向他学习，做一个“毫不利己专门利人”的人。我用张思德的“完全”“彻底”、白求恩的“纯粹”“高尚”当作尺子，来量自己。一下子就把思想上的“开关”打开了，顿时感到心明眼亮。我想，我是贫农的儿子，我当兵是来为人民服务的。为人民服务，能怕艰苦吗？能被困难吓倒吗？想到这里，我就下定决心要在“用”字上狠狠下功夫。第二天，我走着走着觉得头疼，但我想到为人民服务就要坚持斗争，克服困难，我就咬紧牙关坚持锻炼。虽然脚板磨破了，但思想却磨红了。以后不论再遇到多大的困难，我都能用毛主席的话来对照自己，鞭策自己，坚决冲在前面。
