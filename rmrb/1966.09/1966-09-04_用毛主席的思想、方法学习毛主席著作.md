Special Emphasis on the "Use" of Chairman Mao's Works
"Red Ninth Company" Cadres and Soldiers Discuss Experiences in Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works

The cadres and soldiers of the "Model Ninth Company in Studying Chairman Mao's Works" shared their experiences and insights on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the second anniversary of their designation by the Ministry of Defense.

The comrades of the Ninth Company, through irrefutable facts, demonstrated that the principles and methods proposed by Comrade Lin Biao—"study with questions in mind, apply actively, integrate study and use, learn first what is urgently needed, and see immediate results," and "study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially focusing on the 'use'"—are the most fundamental, correct, and effective principles and methods for studying Chairman Mao's works. They are the golden key for the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals to study Mao Zedong Thought.

The most important insight of the Ninth Company comrades is: "Use Chairman Mao's thoughts and methods to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought." Over the past few years, the comrades of the Ninth Company have steadfastly followed this approach to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Although batches of old soldiers have left and new soldiers have joined, the company has always maintained the practice of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, becoming a great crucible for transforming and tempering people. While in the company, they are good soldiers and good cadres. Once they leave the company, they become "red seeds" that sprout, bloom, and bear fruit wherever they are planted.

A handful of reactionary "authorities" from the bourgeoisie have slandered and attacked the workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, labeling it as "pragmatism," "vulgarization," and "simplification." The experiences and insights shared by the Ninth Company comrades are a powerful refutation of these demonic elements.

Study Chairman Mao's Works Using Chairman Mao's Thought and Methods
Company Commander Li Shijie

Chairman Mao has always taught us that theory must be closely linked to practice. The series of principles for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao is to guide us to use Chairman Mao's thoughts and methods to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. We have implemented and practiced these principles for several years and found them to be the most familiar, easiest to accept, most correct, and most effective.

In February of this year, when the company was preparing for a military field training camp, a batch of new comrades arrived. These comrades were all raised under the red flag, and many of them were fresh out of school. They have many advantages, but their class consciousness and awareness of class struggle are relatively weak. The party branch believed that to help them study Mao Zedong Thought well and temper themselves into good soldiers of Chairman Mao, the first lesson should be on class and class struggle. We also considered that some old soldiers had not adequately connected their study of class struggle theory with practice and had not grasped it deeply. We decided to use the countryside as a classroom during this field training, linking it with the domestic and international class struggle situation to study Chairman Mao's discussions on class struggle. On the march, we studied Chairman Mao's quotations while walking; when we stopped, we conducted social surveys, allowing comrades to gain knowledge and raise their awareness through what they saw and heard. During the surveys, we examined the manifestations of various classes and the current situation of class struggle, then linked it to our thoughts, compared it with Chairman Mao's teachings, and conducted discussions and analyses. We marched, studied, and applied along the way. Because we closely linked "study" and "use," we achieved good results. Many new soldiers understood the fundamental issue of relying on whom, uniting with whom, and striking whom; they understood that class enemies, determined by their reactionary nature, are unwilling to perish and will always plot to restore their power. This strengthened the new soldiers' class struggle consciousness. Many comrades said, "Class struggle is still fierce, the revolutionary steps cannot stop, and the guns in our hands cannot be relaxed." They practiced with a sense of enemy presence and conducted the military field training well. All comrades in the company praised this method of active study and application, especially the new comrades, who tasted the sweetness of the first lesson and were even more enthusiastic. They said, "Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is good; study and you understand, understand and you apply, apply and you see immediate results."

    特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫
    “红九连”干部战士座谈活学活用毛主席著作的经验
    “学习毛主席著作模范红九连”的干部战士，在国防部命名两周年的时候，畅谈了他们活学活用毛主席著作的经验和体会。
    红九连的同志在座谈中，以无可辩驳的事实，证明了林彪同志提出的“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影”、“活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在‘用’字上狠下功夫”，是学习毛主席著作的最根本、最正确、最有效的原则和方法，是广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子学习毛泽东思想的金钥匙。
    红九连的同志有一条最重要的体会是：“要用毛主席的思想和方法来学习和运用毛泽东思想”。几年来，红九连的同志坚定不移地这样去学，去用，尽管连队的老战士一批一批地走了，新战士一批一批地来了，但是这个连队始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，成为一个改造人、锻炼人的大熔炉。他们在连队时，是好战士、好干部，离开了连队，就是颗颗“红色的种子”，撒到那里，在那里生根，开花，结果。
    一小撮反动的资产阶级“权威”，诬蔑、攻击工农兵活学活用毛主席著作是“实用主义”、“庸俗化”、“简单化”，红九连同志谈的经验和体会，对于这一小撮牛鬼蛇神，是又一个有力的回击。

    用毛主席的思想、方法学习毛主席著作
    连长　李世杰
    毛主席一贯教导我们：理论要密切联系实际。林彪副主席提出的一系列活学活用毛主席著作的原则，就是教育我们要用毛主席的思想、方法来学习和运用毛泽东思想。林彪副主席的一系列指示，我们贯彻执行了几年，实践了几年，感到最亲切，最容易接受，最正确，最有成效。
    今年二月，连里准备军事野营训练的时候，来了一批新同志。这些同志都是在红旗下长大的，许多人还是刚出学校门的学生。他们有许多优点，但是，阶级和阶级斗争观念比较淡薄。党支部认为，要使他们学习好毛泽东思想，锻炼成为毛主席的好战士，第一课就应该让他们学习阶级和阶级斗争。我们还考虑到有些老战士，过去学习阶级斗争的理论，联系实际不够，领会不深。我们决定在这次野营中，以农村为课堂，联系国内外阶级斗争形势，学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的论述。我们在行军路上，边走边学习毛主席语录；住下来，就进行社会调查，让同志们通过耳闻眼见，增长见识，提高觉悟。在调查中，一查各种不同阶级的表现，二查当前阶级斗争的情况，然后联系思想，对照毛主席教导，进行讨论分析。一路走，一路学，一路用。由于把“学”和“用”密切联系起来，取得了很好的效果。许多新战士弄清了依靠谁，团结谁，打击谁这个根本问题；懂得了阶级敌人为他们的反动本性所决定，是不甘心灭亡的，他们总是要不断进行复辟的阴谋活动。这样就增强了新战士的阶级斗争观念。许多同志说：“阶级斗争还激烈，革命脚步停不得，手中枪杆松不得。”行军演习都带着敌情苦练，军事野营也搞得很好。对这种活学活用的方法，全连同志都称赞。尤其是新同志，上第一课就尝到了甜头，更是欢迎。他们说：“活学活用毛主席著作就是好，学了就懂，懂了就用，用了就立竿见影。”
