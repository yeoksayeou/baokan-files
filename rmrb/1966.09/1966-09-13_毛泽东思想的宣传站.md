Along the more than 2,000-kilometer-long Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the soldiers at various military supply stations of the People's Liberation Army, under harsh conditions, persist in studying Chairman Mao's works. They enthusiastically arrange food and lodging for travelers and even more enthusiastically promote Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, people praise these supply stations as:

	Stations for Promoting Mao Zedong Thought

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining, September 12—Along the more than 2,000-kilometer-long Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the military supply stations of the People's Liberation Army have become stations for promoting Mao Zedong Thought. They enthusiastically arrange food and lodging for travelers and enthusiastically promote Mao Zedong Thought. People call them Chairman Mao's good soldiers and good promoters of Mao Zedong Thought.

	The Qinghai-Tibet Highway is sparsely populated, with a cold and changeable climate. The supply station personnel, under extremely harsh conditions, persist in studying Chairman Mao's works, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and diligently serving the country's defenders and builders who pass by. In their struggle, they deeply feel that revolutionary work cannot be done for a moment without Mao Zedong Thought. When they see many revolutionary comrades who are too busy with work to study, they feel a responsibility to, while doing a good job of arranging food and lodging, create various conditions to allow travelers to have the opportunity to read Chairman Mao's works. In the reception rooms of each supply station, various editions of Chairman Mao's works and related guidebooks are neatly placed. A large part of these books were purchased by the supply station personnel. They also made a large number of quotation boards, hanging them in the most conspicuous places, so that travelers can see and learn as soon as they get off the car.

	Some supply stations also sell Chairman Mao's works and other revolutionary publications.

	Each supply station publishes a blackboard newspaper and wall newspaper, reporting the supply station personnel's experiences and insights in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and praising travelers who persist in studying during their journey. The advanced individuals in each supply station who actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works often, at the invitation of passing travelers, introduce their study methods and insights to the travelers. They vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought, producing a tremendous influence among the passing travelers.

	In their daily propaganda to travelers, the supply stations mainly focus on two tasks: one is to propagate the party's policies and directives of the Military Commission, and the other is to regularly propagate the domestic and international class struggle situation, so that travelers, while on the road, have a global perspective.

	The supply station personnel also pay great attention to the dynamic thoughts of the passing personnel, strengthening political and ideological work.

	To promote Mao Zedong Thought well, each supply station has established and improved propaganda organizations, and the cadres and soldiers are even more active in studying Chairman Mao's works, striving to become good propagandists.

    毛泽东思想的宣传站
    据新华社西宁十二日电　在两千多公里的青藏公路沿线，中国人民解放军的兵站，成了毛泽东思想的宣传站。他们既热情地安排旅客的食宿，又热情地宣传毛泽东思想。人们称他们是毛主席的好战士，毛泽东思想的好宣传员。
    青藏公路沿线人烟少，气候寒冷多变，兵站工作人员在极端艰苦的环境下坚持学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，勤勤恳恳地为来往的祖国保卫者和建设者服务。他们在斗争中深深体会到，干革命一时一刻也离不开毛泽东思想。当他们看到许多革命同志因为工作奔忙学习不便时，就感到自己有责任在做好食宿接待的同时，创造各种条件，让旅客有机会读毛主席著作。在各兵站的接待室里，都整齐地放着各种版本的毛主席著作和有关的辅导书籍。这些书很大一部分是兵站人员购置的。他们还制作了大批语录板，挂在最显眼的地方，让旅客们一下车就能看到，学到。
    有的兵站还代销毛主席著作和其他革命书刊。
    每个兵站都办有黑板报和墙报，登载兵站人员学用毛主席著作的心得体会，表扬旅客在旅途坚持学习的模范事迹。兵站里活学活用毛主席著作的先进人物，也常常应过往人员的邀请，向旅客介绍自己的学习方法和心得。他们大力宣传毛泽东思想，在过往旅客中产生了巨大的影响。
    各兵站在对旅客的日常宣传中，主要抓住了两项工作。一是宣传党的方针政策和军委的重要指示，一是经常宣传国内外阶级斗争形势。使旅客们身在旅途，胸怀世界。
    兵站人员还十分注意针对过往人员的活思想，加强政治思想工作。
    为了宣传好毛泽东思想，各个兵站都建立和健全了宣传组织，干部战士更加积极地学习毛主席著作，争取做一个好宣传员。
