Swedish friends who recently visited China and have now returned to their country are shouting with enthusiasm. They say that the Chinese Cultural Revolution has given them confidence and strength. They believe that Mao Zedong Thought has equally significant implications for the people of capitalist countries.

New China News Agency, Stockholm, September 16 - Members of the "Torch Society" delegation from Sweden, who recently visited China, are filled with excitement and enthusiasm as they praise Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese Cultural Revolution. They said, "We have gained strength and confidence from China."

A university student from the delegation told a reporter from the New China News Agency, "From the practice of the Chinese people, I have clearly understood that Mao Zedong Thought is contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism to a new height. Studying Mao Zedong Thought is not only of great significance to the Chinese people and the people of oppressed countries, but also to the people of capitalist countries. With Mao Zedong Thought, we have a weapon to fight against revisionism and imperialism."

Another young member said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the highest form of Marxism-Leninism, but it is also the easiest to understand. The entire Chinese people study Chairman Mao's works, which fundamentally ensures that China will not produce revisionism. Once revisionism appears, it will be discovered and criticized. Revisionists will absolutely not come to power."

Another member said, "From the Chinese people, I deeply feel that every person armed with Mao Zedong Thought indeed has a spiritual atomic bomb, and China has 700 million people, which is an invincible force."

Many people repeatedly expressed that they want to study more of Mao Zedong's works. They also want to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. They want to learn from the Chinese people, to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, and to combine it with their actual situation.

An excited female member said, "'Long live Chairman Mao!' This is the first Chinese phrase I learned. I shouted with the Chinese Red Guards, 'Long live Chairman Mao!' I love Chairman Mao just like the Chinese people do."

When talking about the great proletarian cultural revolution underway in China, almost everyone could not contain their excitement and praised it unanimously: "Excellent!"

A member said, "This is a very important revolution. The Chinese people are right. It is very necessary for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. By thoroughly eliminating capitalist, feudalist thoughts, culture, customs, and habits, China fundamentally blocks the path to capitalist restoration. This is a deeper class struggle, a continuation of the Chinese socialist revolution. It has given us strength and confidence."

Many members pointed out: Through the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, we have seen that only China truly practices the mass line. The leaders of the party and the state trust the masses, rely on the masses, understand the masses, and support the masses. The masses also support the party. They are united like one person. This is very important.

A female member said, "In China, from Shenyang to Shanghai, from factories to people's communes, everywhere is a revolutionary scene. I received a great education and saw the great power of the masses."

    瑞典朋友访华归国后热情欢呼
    中国文化革命给我们信心和力量
    毛泽东思想对资本主义国家的人民同样具有极其重大的意义
    新华社斯德哥尔摩十六日电　最近访问中国归来的瑞典“火炬社”代表团成员，怀着兴奋和激动的心情，颂扬毛泽东思想，赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。他们说：“我们从中国获得了力量和信心。”
    代表团的一位大学生对新华社记者说：“从中国人民的实践中，我清楚地认识到毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东创造性地把马克思列宁主义发展到了新的高峰。学习毛泽东思想不仅对中国人民和被压迫国家的人民具有极其重大的意义，对于资本主义国家的人民也同样如此。有了毛泽东思想，就有了反对修正主义和帝国主义的武器。”
    另一位青年说：“毛泽东思想是最高的马克思列宁主义，但又是最容易懂的。全中国人民大学毛主席著作，就从根本上保证了中国不出修正主义，人民都用毛泽东思想武装起来了，修正主义一露头，就会被发现，被批判，修正主义者就绝对不会上台。”
    还有一位团员说：“从中国人民身上，我深切体会到，每个用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，的确是有了精神原子弹，而中国有七亿人民，这是绝对不可战胜的力量。”
    许多人都一再表示：我们要更多地学习毛泽东著作，我们也要用毛泽东思想武装起来。我们要像中国人民那样，活学活用毛泽东思想，把它和我们的实际情况结合起来。
    一位女团员激动地说：“‘毛主席万岁！’这是我学到的第一句中国话。我同中国红卫兵们一起振臂高呼：‘毛主席万岁！’我和中国人民一样热爱毛主席。”
    在谈到中国正在进行的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命时，几乎每个人都抑制不住自己的激情，同声赞扬：“好得很！”
    一位团员说：“这是一次极为重要的革命。中国人民做得对。它对中国革命和世界革命都是十分必要的。中国彻底去掉了资本主义、封建主义的思想、文化、风俗和习惯，就从根本上杜绝了资本主义复辟的道路。这是一场更深刻的阶级斗争，是中国社会主义革命的继续。它给了我们力量和信心。”
    不少团员指出：通过中国的无产阶级文化革命，看到了只有中国才真正实行了群众路线。党和国家的领导人，信任群众，依靠群众，了解群众，支持群众。群众也拥护党。他们团结得像一个人一样。这是非常重要的。
    一位女团员说，“在中国，从沈阳到上海，从工厂到人民公社，到处是一片革命景象。我受到了很大的教育，我看到了人民群众的伟大力量。”
