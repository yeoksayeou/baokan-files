The coal mines under the jurisdiction of the New Wenguang Division of the East China Coal Industry Company have, during the Cultural Revolution, strengthened political and ideological work, corrected the attitudes and understanding of cadres towards the movement, and aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm and production initiative of the broad masses of workers, ensuring double victories in the cultural revolution and coal production.

The workers of the Lu 227 team in the Panxi Coal Mine posted big-character posters to the work area director, Cheng Youlin, raising many criticisms. Cheng Youlin initially lacked a correct understanding of the big-character posters, carrying a heavy ideological burden, fearing criticism, and not daring to lead production boldly. After discovering this, the leadership immediately had a talk with Cheng Youlin, explaining the Party's policies to him and helping him correctly recognize his mistakes. Cheng Youlin quickly put down his ideological burden, worked boldly, and had many ideas. He often labored with the workers and promptly solved production problems. In early August, an excavation face encountered protruding rocks, making coal extraction difficult. Some workers only extracted the upper layer, leaving about 30 meters of the lower layer, 80 centimeters thick. Cheng Youlin discovered this and educated the workers to cherish national resources. He personally led the workers to extract the lower layer of coal, increasing the cyclic production by over 30 tons and preventing the loss of over 600 tons of coal for the state. The team members directed their sky-high enthusiasm, aroused during the Cultural Revolution, towards production struggles. In August, the coal production increased by 40% compared to July, setting a new record for the mine.

The Party Committee of New Wenguang Coal Mines went deep into the grassroots, personally organizing and leading the workers to study Chairman Mao's works actively, addressing issues related to the cultural revolution and production struggles. For example, through studying Chairman Mao's quotations before work and evaluating actions after work, the ideological revolution of the workers was greatly promoted, and production enthusiasm was aroused. On July 26, an accident occurred at the 13th layer conveyor belt in the Liangzhuang Mine. The excavation and repair worker, Ji Peizhen, followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties to win victory" and "taking extreme responsibility for work," using every means to overcome difficulties, repaired the conveyor belt, and ensured the completion of the excavation task for that shift. The workers said, "In the past, production was only managed through measures, not through ideology, which could only have a temporary effect; now, production is managed by first addressing ideology, first studying Chairman Mao's works, which can have a long-term effect."

During the process of promoting production through revolution, the Zhangzhuang Mine also implemented the method of reforming while rectifying. For example, the key coal extraction team at the 11th layer frequently experienced roof falls, a long-standing problem that had not been solved. After the masses raised their opinions during the Cultural Revolution, the leading cadres humbly accepted the masses' suggestions, immediately dispatching a deputy mine director and two technicians to the work area to study with veteran workers, quickly solving the roof fall problem. The workers were very satisfied, saying, "The leadership style has truly changed."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted a new production upsurge in the New Wenguang Coal Mines. In July, despite being the rainy season, the average daily coal production of each mine reached the highest level in recent years. The total coal production completed 112.42% of the state plan. In August, the coal production exceeded the state plan by 4,386 tons. The quality of mining and excavation engineering in July and August improved compared to before, and the safety situation was also very good.

    新汶各煤矿在文化大革命中加强政治思想工作
    大抓人的思想革命化促进煤炭生产
    组织职工活学活用毛主席著作，教育干部正确对待革命运动，大胆领导生产，引导工人把革命热情用到生产中去，取得了革命和生产双胜利。
    本报讯　华东煤炭工业公司新汶分公司所属各矿，在文化大革命中加强政治思想工作，端正了干部对运动的认识和态度，激发了广大工人的革命热情和生产积极性，保证了文化革命和煤炭生产的双胜利。
    潘西煤矿鲁227队职工，给工区长程友林贴了大字报，提出了不少意见。程友林开始由于对大字报缺乏正确的认识，背上了思想包袱，怕字当头，不敢大胆领导生产。领导上发现以后，立即找程友林谈话，向他讲明了党的政策，并帮助他正确地认识自己的错误。程友林很快放下了思想包袱，工作大胆了，办法也多了，经常和工人一块劳动，及时解决生产中的问题。八月初，一个采煤工作面碰到了突出来的岩石，采煤较困难，有的工人只采上分层，把八十厘米厚的下分层丢下三十多米长。程友林发现后，就教育工人要爱护国家资源，亲自带领工人去采下分层的煤，使循环产量提高三十多吨，使国家少损失六百多吨煤。这个队的职工把在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到了生产斗争上。八月份产煤量比七月份提高百分之四十，创造了这个矿历史上的最高水平。
    新汶各矿党委深入到基层，亲自组织和领导职工群众带着文化革命和生产斗争中的问题，活学活用毛主席著作。如通过班前学毛主席语录，班后评行动，大大地促进了职工思想革命化，调动了生产积极性。七月二十六日良庄矿十三层溜子出了事故，掘进维修工人季培振就按照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”和“对工作的极端的负责任”的教导，千方百计克服困难，修好了溜子，保证了当班掘进进尺任务的完成。职工们说：“过去抓生产，只抓措施，不抓思想，只能起一时的作用；现在抓生产，先抓思想，先抓学习毛主席著作，就能长期起作用。”
    张庄矿在抓革命促生产的过程中，还实行了边整边改的办法。如重点采煤队十一层经常大冒顶，是长期以来没有解决的老大难问题。在文化大革命中群众提出意见以后，领导干部虚心接受了群众的意见，立即派一名副矿长带领两名技术员，到工区和老工人一起研究，很快地解决了冒顶问题。职工群众很满意地说：“领导作风真正转变了。”
    无产阶级文化大革命，促进了新汶各矿的新的生产高潮。七月份，虽是雨季，各矿平均日产原煤达到近几年来最高水平。原煤总产量完成国家计划的百分之一百一十二点四二。八月份原煤产量又超额四千三百八十六吨完成了国家计划。七、八两月份的采掘工程质量比以前提高，安全情况也很好。
