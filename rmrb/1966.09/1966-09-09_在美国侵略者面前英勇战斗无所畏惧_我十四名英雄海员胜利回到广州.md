In the face of U.S. aggressors, our 14 heroic sailors fought bravely and fearlessly. They have returned victorious to Guangzhou.

Four thousand people held a grand welcome ceremony, and Red Guards presented flowers to the sailors.

A united warning to U.S. imperialism: Blood debts must be repaid in blood.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 8—The 14 crew members of our small cargo ships, No. 1018 and No. 1019, which were attacked by U.S. military aircraft, returned to Guangzhou by train on the morning of the 7th. They were warmly welcomed by over 4,000 people, including Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City maritime workers, relevant departments, and Red Guards and students.

Guangdong Province Acting Governor Lin Liming, Vice Minister of Communications Yu Mei, Director of Guangdong Province Maritime Bureau Yan Shangmin, Party Secretary of Guangzhou Maritime Bureau Li Guanyuan, Chairman of Guangdong Province Federation of Trade Unions Liang Guang, and Chairman of Guangdong Province Seamen's Union Zhang Dongqian welcomed them at the station and expressed their warm greetings.

The Consul General of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Guangzhou, Du Wenmin, also came to the station to welcome them.

The welcoming crowd held up portraits of Chairman Mao and red flags, beating drums and shouting slogans, surging to the station to welcome the heroic sailors' victorious return.

When the 14 heroic sailors marched proudly through the welcoming crowd, the Red Guards presented them with flowers.

A grand welcome ceremony was held at the station. Lin Liming spoke at the meeting. He angrily pointed out that U.S. military aircraft brazenly sank and damaged two of our small cargo ships sailing on normal routes in the Gulf of Tonkin, killing and injuring our sailors. This is another blood debt that U.S. imperialism owes the Chinese people. We express our utmost indignation and strongest protest against this.

Lin Liming pointed out that this incident is another blatant act of war provocation by U.S. imperialism against our country while it expands its aggression in Vietnam. He said: We once again sternly warn the U.S. aggressors: Blood debts must be repaid in blood. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never allow U.S. imperialism to run amok.

Vice Minister of Communications Yu Mei, on behalf of the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and all workers on the national transportation front, extended warm greetings and respect to the 14 sailors who returned victorious. He praised the sailors for holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, showing unwavering determination, fearlessness, selflessness, daring to fight, and daring to win in the face of the aggressors, displaying the heroic spirit of the great Chinese people, and carrying forward and developing the revolutionary tradition of our sailors' brave struggle. He said, your brave deeds are a model for all sailors nationwide and an honor for all transportation workers.

Yu Mei emphasized that U.S. imperialism's mad provocation against the Chinese people will only further inspire the Chinese people's resolve to support Vietnam and resist America. No matter what else U.S. imperialism does, the Chinese people will definitely firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their anti-American, national salvation struggle to the end.

Captain Gao Rongyuan of cargo ships No. 1018 and No. 1019 spoke at the meeting, exposing U.S. imperialism's crimes and introducing their brave struggle. He said, when cargo ships No. 1018 and No. 1019 were sailing on normal routes in the Gulf of Tonkin, U.S. imperialism dispatched multiple military aircraft to provoke these two cargo ships. All crew members expressed great indignation at U.S. imperialism's provocative behavior. Under the leadership of the Party organization, they immediately engaged in a brave struggle against the enemy aircraft. Cargo ship No. 1018 was sunk by U.S. military aircraft, and nine crew members fought bravely to the end, sacrificing their lives for the motherland. Cargo ship No. 1019, despite being attacked by U.S. military aircraft, with bombs exploding around the ship and shrapnel hitting the ship, and water columns from the explosions soaking the crew's clothes, no one was intimidated by the aggressive U.S. aircraft. Everyone stood firm at their posts. In the most difficult times, they remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, fought flexibly and tenaciously against the enemy aircraft. One crew member, despite being seriously injured, encouraged everyone to continue the fight. Those lightly injured also persisted in their duties. The crew members, united as one, braved the enemy aircraft's fierce bombardment, patched over 200 holes on the ship caused by the enemy, and bravely sailed to the destination port, successfully completing their mission.

At the meeting, the sailors also showed everyone the shrapnel from U.S. military aircraft that hit the ship, which is one of the pieces of evidence of U.S. imperialism's provocative crimes.

    在美国侵略者面前英勇战斗无所畏惧
    我十四名英雄海员胜利回到广州
    四千多人隆重举行欢迎大会，红卫兵向海员们献花。
    一致警告美帝国主义：血债必须血来还
    据新华社广州八日电　遭到美帝国主义军用飞机攻击的我国小型货船一零一八号、一零一九号的十四名船员，七日上午乘火车回到广州。他们受到了广东省、广州市航运职工、各有关部门负责人和红卫兵、学生等四千多人的热烈欢迎。
    广东省代省长林李明，交通部副部长于眉，广东省航运厅厅长严尚民，广州海运局党委书记李冠元，广东省总工会主席梁广，广东省海员工会主席张东荃等到车站热烈欢迎他们，并向他们表示亲切的慰问。
    越南民主共和国驻广州总领事杜文敏等也到车站欢迎。
    欢迎群众高举着毛主席像和一面面红旗，敲锣打鼓，高呼口号，涌到车站欢迎英雄的船员们胜利归来。
    当十四名英雄海员雄赳赳地走过欢迎行列时，红卫兵们向他们献了鲜花。
    在车站上举行了隆重的欢迎大会。林李明在会上讲话。他愤怒地指出，美帝国主义军用飞机悍然炸沉炸伤我在北部湾正常航线上行驶的小型货船各一艘，打死打伤我国船员，这是美帝国主义对中国人民欠下的又一笔血债。我们对此表示无比的愤慨和最强烈的抗议。
    林李明指出，这一事件是美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，又一次明目张胆地对我国进行战争挑衅。他说：我们再次严重警告美国侵略者：血债必须血来还。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，绝不能听任美帝国主义胡作非为。
    交通部副部长于眉代表我国交通部、对外贸易部和全国交通战线上的职工，向胜利归来的十四名船员表示亲切的问候和敬意。他赞扬船员们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在侵略者面前表现了坚贞不屈，无所畏惧，不怕牺牲，敢于斗争，敢于胜利的精神，显示了伟大中国人民的英雄气概，继承和发扬了我国海员英勇斗争的革命传统。他说，你们的英勇行为是全国海员的榜样，是全国交通职工的光荣。
    于眉强调说，美帝国主义对中国人民这一疯狂的挑衅，只能更加激励中国人民援越抗美的决心。不管美帝国主义还要干些什么，中国人民一定坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底。
    一零一八号、一零一九号货船的船员代表高荣源在会上向大家揭露了美帝国主义的罪行，介绍了他们英勇斗争的经过。他说，当一零一八号、一零一九号两艘货船正在北部湾正常航线上行驶时，美帝国主义派遣多架军用飞机向这两艘货船进行了挑衅。全体船员对美帝国主义这种挑衅行为表示无比的愤怒。船员们团结一致，在党组织的领导下，立即与敌机展开英勇的斗争。一零一八号货船被美帝国主义军用飞机炸沉，船上有九名船员英勇地战斗到最后，为祖国献出了自己的生命。一零一九号在遭到美帝国主义军用飞机的攻击时，尽管炸弹在船的周围爆炸，弹片打在船上，被炸起的水柱打湿了船员们的衣服，但大家丝毫没有被来势汹汹的美帝国主义飞机吓倒，个个坚守岗位。在最困难的时候，他们牢记着毛主席的教导，机动灵活、英勇顽强地同敌机进行搏斗。一名船员受了重伤后还鼓励大家继续斗争，受轻伤的船员也坚持执行任务。船员们团结一心，冒着敌机猛烈的炮火，把船上被敌机打的二百多个漏洞堵住，勇往直前开往目的港，胜利完成了任务。
    会上，船员们还拿出美帝国主义军用飞机射到船上的弹片给大家看，这是美帝国主义这次挑衅罪行的罪证之一。
