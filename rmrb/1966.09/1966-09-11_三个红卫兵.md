The wind was strong and the rain was heavy. Soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army were rushing to save state property. Suddenly, three young people joined the battle. Their hands were injured, but they did not leave the front line. Rainwater and sweat flowed into their eyes and mouths, but they paid no mind. After the rescue was complete, they did not rest, did not leave their names, and left.

Three Red Guards

On the afternoon of September 3, around 4 o'clock, a fierce whirlwind blew down a building of a certain unit in the Guangdong Provincial Military Region. Broken wood, bricks, and tiles buried cars, repair tools, and a large batch of medicines. Soldiers and officers were braving the wind and rain, desperately rescuing the property.

In the midst of the intense rescue efforts, three young people wearing red armbands suddenly appeared. They carried wood, shouldered medicine boxes, and ran back and forth. The wind was strong and the rain was heavy, blowing people back three steps for every two they took, and soaking them until they could barely open their eyes. However, these three Red Guards, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, regarded state property as the highest priority and spared no effort in the rescue. They carried the heavy wood and medicine boxes and ran with them. Their hands were cut, but they did not leave the front line; rainwater and sweat flowed into their eyes and mouths, but they paid no mind. They worked together with the soldiers, encouraging and cooperating with each other. In no time, they had rescued all the state property.

After the rescue was complete, the three Red Guards were covered in mud and soaked through. The soldiers rushed over to invite them into the barracks to change clothes, drink hot water, and rest, but they declined. Seeing that they wanted to leave, the soldiers asked for their names and which school they attended, intending to write a letter to their school to express thanks. They refused to say anything, only stating that they wanted to learn from the soldiers and that this was what they should do. The soldiers did not let them go, but they broke free, smiling and waving as they ran away. The soldiers watched the Red Guards' departing figures, deeply moved by their loyal dedication to protecting state property, their disregard for personal gain, and their noble character. The soldiers said: The Red Guards, who dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to pioneer, and dare to make revolution, have made immortal contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to destroy the old world and create a new one. Now, when state property is seriously threatened, they bravely rescue it, truly worthy of being revolutionary little generals, Chairman Mao's Red Guards! They also expressed their determination to firmly support all revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, to forever be loyal to the Party, to the people, to Chairman Mao, and to Mao Zedong Thought, and to stand together with the Red Guards, united in struggle, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    风大雨急，解放军干部战士正在抢救国家财产。忽然来了三个青年人，投入这场战斗。他们手破了不下火线，雨水汗水流进眼里口里，也满不在乎。抢救完毕，他们没有休息，没有留下姓名就走了。他们是谁？
    三个红卫兵
    九月三日下午四点多钟，一阵猛烈的旋风，把广东省军区某部的一幢房子刮倒了，碎木头、碎砖瓦把汽车、修理工具和一大批药品埋住了。干部战士正在冒着风雨，奋力抢救。
    在热气腾腾的抢救行列中，忽然出现了三个戴着红袖章的红卫兵。他们抬木头，扛药箱，来回奔跑。风大雨急，吹得人们走三步退两步，淋得人们睁不开眼睛。但是，这三个用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵，把国家的财产看得高于一切，竭尽全力抢救。他们把沉重的木头、药箱，扛起就跑。手划破了不下火线；雨水、汗水流进眼里、口中，也满不在乎。他们跟解放军战士们一起，互相鼓舞、互相协作，不一会，就把所有的国家财产都抢救出来了。
    抢救完毕，三个红卫兵已是满身泥污，浑身湿漉漉了。战士们一下子围了上去，请他们进营房换衣服、喝开水，休息休息，但被他们谢绝了。战士们见他们要走，忙问他们叫什么名字，在哪个学校念书，准备写封信向他们的学校致谢。他们怎么也不肯说，只说他们要向解放军学习，这是他们应该做的。战士们不放他们走，他们却挣脱了手，微笑着向战士们招招手，一溜烟地跑了。战士们望着红卫兵远去的身影，都为他们忠心保卫国家财产，不为名、不图利的高贵品质所感动。战士们说：敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的红卫兵，在摧毁旧世界，创造新世界的无产阶级文化大革命中，立下了不朽的功勋。如今，当国家财产受到严重威胁的时候，他们又见义勇为，奋力抢救，真不愧是革命的小将，毛主席的红卫兵！他们还表示要坚决支持红卫兵的一切革命行动，永远忠于党、忠于人民、忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想，誓与红卫兵站在一起，团结战斗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
