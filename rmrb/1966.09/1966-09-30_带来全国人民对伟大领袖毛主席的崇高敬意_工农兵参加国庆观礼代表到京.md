New China News Agency, September 29th: Representatives from various regions' industrial and agricultural fronts, who are heroes and models, have arrived in Beijing, carrying the warmest greetings and the highest respect from the people of the entire nation to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Over 1,200 workers and peasants who have arrived in Beijing are all labor models, active learners and users of Chairman Mao's works, and active participants in the socialist education movement in cities and countryside. Among them are the "Iron Man" of Daqing, Wang Jinxi, representative of Dazhai Brigade, Jia Jincai, Zhang Zhongmin and Ran Shurong from the 32111 drilling team who bravely extinguished a fire and saved a gas well, famous industrial labor models Huang Rongchang and Wang Linhe who are daring to scale the heights of technology, Wang Yongxing and Li Quanhou from Xiadinjia Brigade and Nangundonggou Brigade who have worked hard to transform the land, Eu Yang Hai's father Eu Yanghengwen, Wang Jie's father Wang Rutan, and Liu Yingjun's mother Zhu Xiu Lan.

Representatives from the People's Liberation Army across the country have brought letters from their units to Chairman Mao, expressing their boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, and their determination to defend Chairman Mao, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend Mao Zedong Thought. Upon arriving in Beijing, the representatives saw that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as Red Guards and revolutionary students in the capital, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, have swept away the "four olds" and established the "four news," completely transforming the face of the capital. They all felt inspired and unanimously expressed their support for the revolutionary actions of the people in Beijing, vowing to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

Most of these representatives are active learners of Chairman Mao's works, with over 90% being grassroots cadres, five-good soldiers, and representatives of four-good platoons. Among them are Guo Xiaosi, deputy platoon leader of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region, who insists on emphasizing politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide military affairs, and firmly implements Chairman Mao's military line; Zhang Daolu, quartermaster of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region, who created the method of saving coal by changing stoves; Cai Lianlun, deputy political instructor of a certain unit in the Guangzhou Military Region; Wang Jinzhu, deputy political instructor of a certain unit in the Lanzhou Military Region, who uses dialectics to solve platoon management and education; Liao Shuangquan, platoon leader of a certain unit in the Chengdu Military Region; and Gong Huacheng, representative of a certain unit in the Wuhan Military Region, which is an advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's works and has been rated as a four-good platoon for four consecutive years.

Many representatives come from the front lines of anti-enemy combat in the sea, air, and border defense. Among them are Xu Yongjiang and Wang Yunwan, who were awarded for their bravery in the "August 6" naval battle and the battle east of Chongwu last year, Air Force representative Feng Quanmin, who shot down an unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft invading our country by the U.S. imperialists, Deputy Commander Wang Qingyuan, who has been on duty day and night at a certain border outpost in Tibet and was awarded the second-class merit, and Deputy Platoon Leader Xiao Xilai from a certain unit on the front line in Fujian, who was awarded the second-class merit for eliminating Kuomintang armed spies.

Among the representatives, there are also model soldiers like Wang Yuchang, a supply officer from the Air Force of the Fuzhou Military Region, Wang Xingzhi, a naval model who has been red for nine years, Li Kongque, a head nurse from a certain hospital of the Fuzhou Military Region who serves the wounded and sick wholeheartedly, and Zhang Shanning, a quartermaster from a certain artillery platoon of the Xinjiang Military Region who risked his life to save a child from a car accident.
