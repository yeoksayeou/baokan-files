The Indonesian rightist military regime has recently openly colluded with the neo-colonialist creation "Malaysia," signing a so-called "agreement to normalize relations between the two countries" and announcing the cessation of opposition to "Malaysia." This is a great betrayal of the interests of the Indonesian people, a great treachery against the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among Asian and African peoples, and a further exposure of the reactionary face of the Indonesian rightist military clique in its servitude to American imperialism.

Opposing "Malaysia" is a glorious banner of struggle for the Indonesian people against imperialism and colonialism. Their struggle is not only to defend Indonesia's national interests and resist imperialist military encirclement of Indonesia but also to strongly support the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia, particularly the struggle of the people of North Kalimantan for national independence. The British and American imperialists and their lackeys have tried every means to strangle the Indonesian people's struggle against "Malaysia." However, the Indonesian people have bravely persisted in this struggle, winning the praise and sympathy of the Asian, African, and world peoples.

Since the rightist military clique staged the counter-revolutionary coup, it has established a military fascist dictatorship at home, forming the most reactionary cabinet since Indonesia's independence. In a few months, they have massacred tens of thousands of people, imprisoned many more, and persecuted countless patriots. Their bloody rule over the Indonesian people is unprecedented in history. In foreign relations, while they are frantically engaging in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, they are increasingly openly aligning with American imperialism, step by step integrating Indonesia politically, economically, and militarily into the American imperialist strategic system in Asia.

They have begged for "aid" from the United States, Britain, Japan, and other countries. In addition to providing money themselves, American imperialism has also, through the Sato government of Japan, given them tens of millions of dollars in "emergency aid." The Sato government also plans to form a "Tokyo Club" consisting of the United States, Britain, West Germany, and other countries as an international institution to "aid" the Indonesian reactionaries. The modern revisionist group centered around the CPSU leadership has also hurriedly expressed its willingness to provide so-called "aid" to Indonesia.

After seizing power, they immediately clamored to "improve relations with the United States" and to "return to the United Nations." What is particularly noteworthy is that in recent months, they have intensified their collusion with the authorities of "Malaysia," Thailand, and the Philippines, concocting an anti-communist and anti-Chinese so-called "Southeast Asian Nations Cooperation Alliance," openly serving the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism.

Today, American imperialism has shifted its strategic focus from Europe to Asia, attempting to use Japanese militarism as the core to concoct a new anti-communist alliance in Asia, further encircling China. While expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam, it is also intensifying the deployment to suppress the national liberation movements in Asia. It is precisely in this context that the Indonesian rightist military regime has announced the cessation of the struggle against "Malaysia" and is actively planning to establish an anti-communist alliance in Southeast Asia. Recently, the Indonesian rightist ruling clique has even agreed with "Malaysia" to establish a "Joint Defense and Security Committee." It is clear that this so-called "joint defense" is aimed at the liberation struggle of the people of North Kalimantan. The Indonesian rightist military regime has turned its guns on the brothers who have stood shoulder to shoulder with the Indonesian people in the anti-imperialist struggle. This is an unpardonable crime against the Indonesian people and the revolutionary people of Southeast Asia.

In less than a year since the Indonesian rightist military regime came to power, it has followed American imperialism in doing countless evil deeds. Yet it still claims that it is against imperialism and colonialism and still pursues an "independent and active foreign policy." This is sheer self-deception! In reality, the Indonesian rightist military regime has become a new lackey of imperialism in suppressing the national liberation movements in Southeast Asia.

The Indonesian people have a glorious revolutionary tradition of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism. They will not allow a handful of reactionaries to drag Indonesia backward. They will surely rise up to resist. The revolutionary people of Southeast Asia will also not allow the Indonesian rightists to harm the revolutionary movement in this region. The imperialists and their lackeys' frenzied attacks on the revolutionary masses will only further promote the revolutionary awakening of the people of various countries and further stir up new revolutionary waves. American imperialism is already surrounded by the people of the world and is having a harder time. What good end can the Indonesian rightist military regime expect by tying itself to the American imperialist war chariot?

    印尼右派为谁效劳？
    观察家
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权，最近公然同新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”同流合污，签订了所谓“使两国关系正常化的协议”，宣布停止对抗“马来西亚”。这是印度尼西亚右派军人政权对印度尼西亚人民利益的大出卖，对亚非人民团结反帝事业的大背叛，是印度尼西亚右派将领集团投靠美帝国主义的反动面目的进一步大暴露。
    对抗“马来西亚”，是印度尼西亚人民反帝反殖的一面光荣的战斗旗帜。他们的这一斗争，不仅是为了保卫印度尼西亚的民族利益，反对帝国主义对印度尼西亚的军事包围，而且也是对东南亚民族解放运动的有力支援，特别是对北加里曼丹人民争取民族独立斗争的支持。英美帝国主义及其帮凶，千方百计地企图扼杀印度尼西亚人民对抗“马来西亚”的斗争。但是，印度尼西亚人民英勇地坚持了这一斗争，博得了亚非人民和全世界人民的赞扬和同情。
    印度尼西亚右派将领集团自从发动反革命军事政变以来，在国内建立了军事法西斯统治，组成印度尼西亚独立以来最反动的内阁。几个月之间，他们屠杀了数十万人民，把更多的人投入监狱，无数爱国人士横遭迫害。他们对印度尼西亚人民的血腥统治，是史无前例的。在对外关系上，他们在疯狂地进行反华排华的同时，日益露骨地投靠美帝国主义，一步一步地从政治、经济和军事上，把印度尼西亚纳入美帝国主义在亚洲的战略体系。
    他们向美、英、日等国伸手乞讨“援助”。美帝国主义除了自己出钱之外，还通过日本佐藤政府给了他们几千万美元的“紧急援助”。佐藤政府还打算组成一个由美国、英国、西德等国参加的“东京俱乐部”作为“援助”印度尼西亚反动派的国际机构。以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义集团，也急急忙忙表示，要向印度尼西亚提供所谓“援助”。
    他们在篡夺政权后就叫嚷，要同美国“改善关系”，要“重回联合国”。尤其值得注意的是，近几个月以来，他们加紧同“马来西亚”、泰国、菲律宾的当局勾结，拼凑反共反华的所谓“东南亚国家的合作联盟”，公然为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策效劳。
    今天，美帝国主义已经把它的战略重点从欧洲转移到了亚洲，力图以日本军国主义为核心，拼凑新的亚洲反共联盟，加紧包围中国。在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，它正加紧部署镇压亚洲的民族解放运动。正是在这样的背景下，印度尼西亚右派军人政权宣布停止对抗“马来西亚”的斗争，并且积极策划建立东南亚反共联盟。最近，印度尼西亚右派统治集团竟然同“马来西亚”商定建立“防务与治安联合委员会”。事情很明显，这种所谓“联合防务”的矛头是针对北加里曼丹人民的解放斗争的。印度尼西亚右派军人政权把枪口转向同印度尼西亚人民并肩反帝的兄弟，这是印度尼西亚人民和东南亚革命人民所绝对不能饶恕的滔天罪行。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权上台不到一年，追随美帝国主义干了无数坏事。但是它居然还口口声声说什么，它仍然是反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的，仍然奉行“独立的积极的外交政策”。这完全是自欺欺人！实际上，印度尼西亚右派军人政权已经成为帝国主义镇压东南亚民族解放运动的一名新的走卒。
    印度尼西亚人民具有反帝反殖的光荣革命传统。他们绝不允许一小撮反动派把印尼拉向倒退。他们一定会奋起进行反抗。东南亚的革命人民也绝不会允许印度尼西亚右派危害这一地区的革命运动。帝国主义及其走狗对革命群众的疯狂进攻，只能进一步促进各国人民的革命觉醒，进一步激起新的革命的怒涛。美帝国主义已陷于世界人民的重重包围之中，日子越来越不好过。印度尼西亚右派军人政权把自己绑在美帝国主义的战车上，又能得到什么好下场呢？
