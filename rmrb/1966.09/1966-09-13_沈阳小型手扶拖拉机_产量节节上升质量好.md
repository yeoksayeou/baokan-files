Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the production of small tractors at the Shenyang Small Tractor Factory has been steadily increasing. In August, the production of hand-held tractors increased by 60% compared to April, and the quality of the products is excellent.

The factory's production tasks are very heavy this year. During the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the workers have been steadfastly at their posts, overcoming various difficulties in production. They have displayed the spirit of daring to think, dare to do, dare to break through, and dare to make revolution, breaking away from many old frameworks, old habits, and old systems in production. This has effectively promoted the development of production.
