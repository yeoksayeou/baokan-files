With Mao Zedong Thought,
The bayonet in our hands will always shine red;
With Mao Zedong Thought,
The ghosts and snakes will not dare to stir up trouble!

This is the bold declaration of the crew members of a boat squad that participated in the Chongwu Sea Battle. It embodies the glorious thought that our army is always a fighting force, expressing their resolute determination to defend the great socialist motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It also expresses their boundless love for the infallible Mao Zedong Thought.

This heroic boat squad faces enemy-occupied islands and has been fighting against the infiltration activities of the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits for a long time. Sometimes they suddenly appear in the foggy sea, sometimes they patrol all night in the dark; sometimes they swiftly approach the enemy's island; sometimes they hide behind a small island, in coordination with fishermen and militia, they unexpectedly eliminate the enemy who is destroying the fishing grounds.

The soldiers say well: "The surging sea has its calm moments, but in class society, class struggle never ceases." They deeply understand Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle from their rich combat life. The more they study, the clearer their minds and the more ardent their fighting spirit. Many boats in this squad have records of over a thousand patrols and sorties. Most comrades have been awarded for their merits in battle. Many companies and numerous boats have been awarded collective honors, and some boats have been named as models for the entire navy. On their bridges, you can often see newly added red and shining five-pointed stars, symbolizing victories in sea battles.

The soldiers' unshakable loyalty to the Party and the motherland is particularly evident in their resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's teaching: "Against the enemy, we must be ruthless, we must crush them, we must annihilate them." One night, suddenly, an order came from the command center: a suspicious target has been spotted in a certain sea area. The boat squad immediately rushed out of the harbor like a tiger down the mountain, straight towards the target. The sea was pitch-black, with only the waves faintly glowing, but the former chief of the main gun crew, who had trained his eyes to see a thousand miles, immediately spotted a black dot resembling a reef a few hundred meters away. The captain, who was familiar with the sea area, immediately determined: there are no reefs here, it must be the enemy, prepare for battle! The commander's order was given, and the boat quickly cut off the retreat of the American and Chiang Kai-shek spies. The first volley of shells hit the target, and a second burst of short-range fire blew the enemy ship to smithereens!

"Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the cause of the people." The crew members, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have heightened their vigilance a hundredfold and firmly guard their posts. To ensure they do not miss a single opportunity for battle, they stay on the boat 365 days a year, never leaving the boat more than 100 meters during the day; at night, many of them sleep in their clothes, guarding the machines, ready to start up and attack the enemy at any moment.

### 为祖国和毛主席站岗——守卫在东海前线的一支英雄艇队

    为祖国和毛主席站岗
    ——守卫在东海前线的一支英雄艇队
    新海
    有了毛泽东思想，
    手中的刺刀永远闪红光；
    有了毛泽东思想，
    牛鬼蛇神休想兴风作浪！
    这是参加过崇武海战的艇队指战员的豪言壮语。它体现了我军永远是个战斗队的光辉思想，表达了他们捍卫伟大的社会主义祖国、捍卫无产阶级文化大革命的坚强决心，也表达了他们对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱。
    这支英雄的艇队面对着敌占岛屿，长年和美蒋匪特的窜犯活动作斗争。这支艇队有时在雾海突然出现，有时在暗夜通宵巡行；有时迅猛地插到敌岛鼻子底下；有时潜藏在小岛背后，在渔民和民兵的配合下，出其不意地消灭破坏渔场的敌人。
    战士们说得好：“汹涌的大海有平静的时候，在阶级社会里，阶级斗争却永远不会停息。”他们从自己的丰富的战斗生活中，深刻地领会了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导。他们越学越心明眼亮，斗志昂扬。这支艇队的许多艇只都有千次以上的巡逻、出击纪录，大多数同志都荣立过战功，一些中队和不少艇只都荣立过集体功，有的艇还被评为全海军的标兵。在他们的驾驶台上，常常可以看到新增添的标志着海战胜利的鲜红耀眼的五角星。
    战士们对党和祖国的无限忠诚，突出地表现在坚决执行毛主席的教导：“对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它”。一个深夜，突然接到指挥部命令：某海区发现可疑目标。艇队立即像猛虎下山似地冲出海港，直扑目标。海面上一片漆黑，只有浪花隐隐闪光，可是，锻炼出一双千里眼的前主炮班长立即发现了几百米外有个状似礁石的黑点。对海区了如指掌的艇长立即断定：这里没有礁石，一定是敌人，准备战斗！指挥员的命令一下达，战艇飞速地切断了美蒋特务的退路，第一组炮弹就命中目标，再一组短点射，就把敌船打得粉身碎骨！
    “捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”。指战员遵照毛主席的教导，百倍地提高警惕，坚守岗位。为了不失去一次战斗时机，他们一年三百六十五天，白天上岸不离舰艇一百米；夜晚，许多人和衣而睡，守着机器，只要一声令下，就立即启动去打击敌人。
