Edition: 2

The publication and distribution of the revised and enlarged soldier's edition of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" is a major event in the political life of the People's Liberation Army. It will undoubtedly promote the deeper development of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the army.

Previously, due to the sabotage by a small clique of anti-party and anti-socialist elements who controlled the propaganda and publishing departments, the publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works were severely suppressed for a long time, and "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" could not be adequately supplied. To meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of soldiers in the army to study Chairman Mao's works, the General Political Department, in accordance with the instructions of the Military Commission and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, printed and distributed the soldier's edition of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" in August 1961. This edition was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of soldiers. In recent years, with the deepening of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the army, many comrades have demanded an increase in the number of articles in the selected readings, including the addition of some important articles published by Chairman Mao after the nation's victory. The General Political Department accepted the demands of the broad masses of soldiers and decided last October to revise and reprint the selected readings. The new edition includes Chairman Mao's works on class struggle and international situation, philosophical works such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," and works on ideological transformation, among others, increasing from the original 80,000 characters to 230,000 characters.

The preface to the new edition of the selected readings states, "This selected readings, together with the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' are the basic political readings for soldiers and the basic teaching materials for political education in the platoons. It is required that soldiers basically complete the study of these materials during their service period." According to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on "reducing the amount, increasing the frequency, and repeatedly studying the main issues," the General Political Department also stipulates that sixteen articles (excerpts) such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Rectifying Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "In Service of the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" must be repeatedly read, explained, discussed, and applied.

After receiving the new edition of the selected readings, the broad masses of soldiers were extremely excited and expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and to forever be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. The officers and soldiers of a certain machine gun company in a unit discussed and said, "Just as we are responding to Chairman Mao's great call to turn our army into a revolutionary school, the General Political Department is sending us the new edition of 'Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong.' This is as timely as rain in a drought and as needed as charcoal in the snow. This is the greatest care and encouragement from the Central Committee of the Party, Chairman Mao, the Military Commission, and Vice Chairman Lin Biao. We will resolutely carry out Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions, definitely engrave Chairman Mao's words in our hearts, and implement them in our actions. We will use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, transform everything, and promote everything, truly turning the platoon into a school of Mao Zedong Thought." A soldier from a certain unit, Constant Sea, excitedly said: "The General Political Department, based on our demands, reprinted the 'Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong.' This is a great joy for us soldiers. Looking back at my growth process, which step was not guided by Chairman Mao's book? Chairman Mao's book is our family treasure, and Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. I have boundless respect for Chairman Mao and yearn to see Chairman Mao day and night. Whatever Chairman Mao says, I will definitely carry it out."

    解放军政治生活中的又一件大喜事
    《毛泽东著作选读》战士本增订出版
    总政治部指出，这一选读本连同《毛主席语录》，就是战士的基本政治读物，就是连队政治教育的基本教材，要求战士在服役期间基本学完
    据新华社八日讯　人民解放军总政治部编印、供战士学习的《毛泽东著作选读》，已于最近增订出版，开始在全军发行。这是我军政治生活中的又一件大喜事，必将推动我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动更深入开展。
    过去，由于一小撮反党反社会主义黑帮分子把持宣传出版部门，对毛主席著作的出版发行工作疯狂压制，长期以来，《毛泽东选集》不能充分供应。为了满足部队广大战士学习毛主席著作的迫切需要，总政治部根据军委、林彪副主席的指示，于一九六一年八月印发了供战士学习的《毛泽东著作选读》，受到了广大战士的热烈欢迎。近几年来，随着我军活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的深入发展，许多同志都要求增加选读本的文章，包括增加毛主席在全国胜利以后新发表的一些重要文章。总政治部接受广大战士的要求，于去年十月决定增订再版。新的选读本增加了毛主席关于阶级斗争和国际形势方面的论著，《实践论》、《矛盾论》等哲学著作和关于思想改造的论著，等等，由原来的八万字增加到二十三万字。
    新选读本的出版说明指出，“这一选读本连同《毛主席语录》，就是战士的基本政治读物，就是连队政治教育的基本教材，要求战士在服役期间基本学完。”根据林彪副主席关于“减少分量，增加次数，抓住主要问题反复学”的指示，总政治部还规定《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《愚公移山》等十六篇（节）文章，必须反复阅读，反复讲解，反复讨论，反复运用。
    广大战士领到新的选读本以后，心情万分激动，纷纷表示要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，永远做毛主席的好战士。某部机枪连干部战士在讨论中说，正当我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，把我军办成革命化的大学校的时候，总政治部又要给我们送来新的《毛泽东著作选读》，这真是旱天下透雨一样及时，雪夜送炭一样需要。这是党中央、毛主席、军委和林彪副主席对我们最大的关怀和鼓舞。我们坚决贯彻执行林彪副主席的指示，一定要把毛主席的书字字句句刻在心上，落实在行动上。用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切，推动一切，真正把连队办成毛泽东思想的大学校。某部战士常海激动地说：总政治部根据我们的要求，重新编印了《毛泽东著作选读》，这对我们战士来说，是件特大的喜事。回顾自己成长的过程，哪一步不是毛主席的书指引着往前走的！毛主席的书是我们的传家宝，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。我无限敬爱毛主席，日夜渴望见见毛主席。凡是毛主席说的，我都要坚决照办。
