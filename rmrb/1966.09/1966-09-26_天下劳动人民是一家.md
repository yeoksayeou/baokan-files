Last year, I heard from a young Japanese friend that in Japan, people who clean toilets are discriminated against everywhere and are considered the lowest of the low. They push their carts through wind and rain, living in poverty and cold. I also heard that in India, the people who clean toilets are "untouchables." They cannot walk alongside others, and even when buying things, they cannot hand the money directly to the shopkeeper.

All oppressed laboring people in the world are like fruits on the same vine! I thought of my own experiences before liberation. Wasn't I just like them? I fled to Beijing at the age of fifteen and became a toilet cleaner, the most despised job in old society. I suffered immensely under the oppression of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the exploitation of feudal bosses. My left eye was blinded by the Japanese invaders. My left leg still bears a scar from being hit by an American military vehicle. Now, I have become the master of the state and a representative of the National People's Congress, but I will never forget the class hatred left on my body by the American and Japanese reactionaries.

All laboring people of the world are one family. Since the birth of imperialism, this bloodthirsty monster, it has colluded with reactionaries from various countries, wreaking havoc and oppressing the people. From then on, the laboring people of the world, due to their shared experiences, have become united in heart. No matter whether they are from the United States, Japan, or other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, they are all our class brothers with whom we share a common heart. We stand on the same anti-imperialist front and must unite and support each other.

Chairman Mao has said, "The proletariat can only liberate itself by liberating all humanity." He also said, "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggles of the people who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Chairman Mao's words have enlightened me. I will carry my bucket and look out at the world. We must not forget that three-quarters of the world's people are still not liberated. We must firmly support their struggles. Now, American imperialism is intensifying its aggression against Vietnam. Although I am over fifty, I am ready at any time to support our Vietnamese brothers. If the Vietnamese people need me, I will immediately rush to the front lines!

Chairman Mao said, "To defeat the reactionary rule of imperialism, we must form a broad united front and unite all forces that can be united, excluding the enemy, and continue the arduous struggle." This is very important. All oppressed and exploited laboring people of the world, unite! When we stand together, our strength is immense, and American imperialism and all its lackeys will be doomed. But we must beware of the tricks of the Soviet revisionist clique. They talk about anti-imperialism on the surface but collude with American imperialism in secret. They say they support the oppressed people but actually betray the revolutionary people. These people are as bad as the running dogs of the landlords. We must never be fooled by them and engage in any "joint actions" with them.

All revolutionary people of the world, unite to make revolution! In a thousand ways and ten thousand ways, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, the hearts of all people in the world will be even more united, the direction of struggle will be more consistent, and actions will be more decisive. The victory of the world revolution is definitely coming!

    天下劳动人民是一家
    去年，我听到日本的青年朋友告诉我，在日本，掏粪工人处处受到歧视，被看成是最低贱的人，他们推着粪车，风里来，雨里去，过着吃不饱穿不暖的日子。我还听说，在印度，打扫厕所的清洁工人都是“贱民”，他们不能挨着别人走路，连买东西的时候，都不能把钱直接交给店员手里。
    全世界受压迫的劳动人民真是一条藤上的瓜呵！我想起了自己在解放以前的遭遇，不也是跟他们一样的吗？我从十五岁逃荒到北京，当上了旧社会里最被人瞧不起的掏粪工。我受尽了帝国主义和蒋介石反动派的压迫，吃尽了封建把头的剥削苦。我的左眼被日本侵略者打瞎了。我的左腿上，还留着被美国军车撞伤的一块疤。现在，我已经作了国家的主人，还当了全国人民代表大会代表，但是我永远忘不了美日反动派留在我身上的阶级仇恨的印证。
    天下劳动人民是一家。自从帝国主义这个吃人肉喝人血的坏蛋出世以后，它勾结了各国反动派，到处横行霸道，欺压人民。从此以后，世界上的劳动人民，由于共同的遭遇，就连成一条心了，谁也不能把我们分开。不管是美国、日本还是其他亚非拉国家的劳动人民，同我们都是心连心的阶级兄弟。我们站在同一条反帝战线上，就要互相团结，互相支持。
    毛主席他老人家说过，无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己。他还说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”毛主席的话使我心里亮堂了，我要身背粪桶，眼望世界。我们决不能忘记世界上还有三分之二的人没有解放，我们要坚决支持他们的斗争。现在美帝国主义正在加紧侵略越南，别看我五十多岁了，我还随时准备支援越南兄弟，只要越南人民需要，我就立刻奔赴前线！
    毛主席说：“为了战胜帝国主义的反动统治，必须结成广泛的统一战线，必须团结不包括敌人在内的一切可以团结的力量，继续进行艰巨的斗争。”这是非常重要的。全世界被压迫被剥削的劳动人民团结起来，拧成一股劲，力量就大得很，美帝国主义和它的一切走狗就要完蛋。但是我们要当心苏联修正主义领导集团的鬼花样。他们明里说要反帝，暗里同美帝合伙。他们说的是“支持”被压迫人民，干的是出卖革命人民的勾当。这号人跟地主的狗腿子一样坏。我们千万不能上他们的当，跟他们搞什么“联合行动”。
    全世界革命人民团结起来闹革命，千条万条，靠的就是毛泽东思想。有了毛泽东思想，全世界人民的心就会连得更紧，斗争的方向更加一致，行动更加坚决，世界革命的胜利必定会来到！
