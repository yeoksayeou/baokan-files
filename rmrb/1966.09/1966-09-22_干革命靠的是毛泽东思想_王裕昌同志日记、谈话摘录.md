Yesterday, we published a report titled "Caring for Soldiers is Caring for the Revolution," which introduced the heroic deeds of Comrade Wang Yuchang, a good soldier and exemplary leader loved by Chairman Mao. Today, we publish excerpts from his diary and his usual conversations. From these, we can further see Comrade Wang Yuchang's boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, his dedication to revolution and the people, his fearlessness in the face of hardship and death, and his outstanding qualities. Through these diary entries and conversation excerpts, we can better understand Comrade Wang Yuchang's lofty spiritual realm. —Editor

Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts

	* Everyone says the sun is warm, but it's not as warm as Mao Zedong Thought; everyone says mothers are dear, but the Party is even dearer!
	* Chairman Mao! Your thoughts shine brightly in the hearts of all people, giving strength to the revolutionary people, striking fear into the hearts of the American imperialists, and sweeping away all ghosts and monsters!
	* Chairman Mao, you are the helmsman of the world's revolutionary people. To support the world's revolutionary people, I will go wherever you point. If you want me to make charcoal, I will be Zhang Zedong; if you want me to block a gun hole, I will be Huang Jiguang...
	* Mao Zedong Thought always represents the people, speaks for the people, and works for the people. Chairman Mao cares for the people, and the people's hearts are with Chairman Mao.
	* Using Mao Zedong Thought to guide our socialist construction, we have boundless wisdom and strength; people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the greatest fighting power against the enemy.
	* With Mao Zedong Thought, people fear nothing, not even atomic bombs. The atomic bombs of imperialism and revisionism combined cannot defeat people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
	* Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun in our hearts, and Chairman Mao's works are the food of revolutionary soldiers. We must study them every day, forever, for a lifetime, and use them for a lifetime!
	* The Party is my loving mother, and Chairman Mao is my loving father. It is you who educated and nurtured me, allowing me to do what I should for the people.
	* Sunshine, air, and food can only keep one alive. Mao Zedong Thought gives people wisdom and strength, making them brave and diligent.
	* Only with Mao Zedong Thought can one have high awareness and clear direction. A ship sailing in the ocean needs a rudder, and a revolutionary soldier needs Mao Zedong Thought.
	* Only by seriously reading Chairman Mao's books can one firmly grasp the ideological weapon and fight accurately and fiercely against the enemy!
	* To revolutionize, one must study Chairman Mao's works; to serve the people, one must study "In Memory of Norman Bethune."
	* Use Mao Zedong Thought to constantly transform one's own thoughts, discard the "self," and revolutionize without fearing difficulties or dangers; when there are difficulties and dangers, one can dare to confront and struggle against them.
	* Reading Chairman Mao's books has given me a hundredfold strength, enabling me to overcome all difficulties.
	* Studying Chairman Mao's works requires not only intellectual research but also constant action to embody them.
	* To revolutionize, one must read Chairman Mao's books. Revolutionizing for a lifetime means reading Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and propagating Mao Zedong Thought for a lifetime.

Selflessly Devoted to Serving the People

	* To contribute to the Party and the people, to be a genuine Communist Party member, one must first resolutely abandon all personal selfish thoughts, be selfless, and wholeheartedly serve the people.
	* A revolutionary, a Communist Party member, can only be judged by whether they absolutely and unconditionally subordinate personal interests to the Party's interests. This is the standard for judging whether a Party member is loyal to the Party, loyal to the revolution, and loyal to the cause of communism.
	* Everyone should place the Party's interests first, with not a hint of "self" in their minds.
	* Live for the revolution, die for the revolution, not for fame or gain, wholeheartedly for the people, diligently and conscientiously, loyally and sincerely serving the Party and the people, fighting—this is the greatest joy and happiness in life.
	* Everyone's abilities are different, but using all one's strength for revolutionary work is the greatest joy.
	* I feel that using my labor to contribute to improving the army's combat effectiveness is the most joyful thing.
	* Serving the people means obeying the Party's needs; the Party says do what, do what.
	* As long as it serves the people, let me do anything!
	* Everything should start from the people's interests and obey organizational decisions!
	* We came to the army to revolutionize. Revolutionizing means not comparing honors or positions but comparing contributions to the people.
	* We should truly progress, truly have honor. True honor is not in form but in thought, which is having the most Mao Zedong Thought and the highest class consciousness.
	* Wholeheartedly serving the people means not having a hint of falseness. Only this way can one dare to face death and dare to brave fire and mountains!
	* A revolutionary's life belongs to the Party and the people, with no right to consider disability or death.
	* If we do something beneficial for the people and the Party, it is our duty. For the people's interests, even sacrificing is justified.
	* We must resolutely stand with all the people of the world, support the world's people, and defeat American imperialism, contributing all our strength!

"Our Cadres Must Care for Every Soldier"

	* Loving comrades is loving the revolution. The people's happiness is my happiness; comrades' happiness is my happiness!
	* Our cadres must care for every soldier, the more difficult the environment, the more we must care.
	* The Party has entrusted us with the task of cultivating revolutionary successors. We must care for them like their family.
	* The people have worked hard to raise their children and handed them over to the army. We are the ones leading the soldiers. If we do not care for them well, and if we can rescue them in danger but do not, we will be ungrateful to the Party, the people, and our class brothers. We will not be revolutionary cadres or Communist Party members!
	* The loss of a revolutionary comrade is a loss to the revolution. Even if it means sacrificing oneself, one must save them! If one can exchange one's death for a comrade's life, I feel that dying is worthwhile.

Live for the Revolution, Die for the Revolution

	* For the revolution, I can give up everything. For the revolution, for the people, even sacrificing is glorious!
	* For the people's interests, even being crushed to death is willingly accepted!
	* Whether a person's life is valuable does not depend on its length but mainly on whether they are loyal to the Party and have contributed to the people. Liu Hulan, Dong Cunrui, and Huang Jiguang were all young, but they were "great in life, glorious in death."
	* Chairman Mao said, regarding illness, one must have a strong will to fight. For a revolutionary soldier, illness is not frightening; what is frightening is a weak will.
	* Mao Zedong Thought has given me boundless strength. I must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of optimism, overcome all illnesses, recover health soon, and fight with my comrades.
	* I have lost my right hand and right leg, but I still have my left hand and left leg. More importantly, I still have a heart that serves the people. As long as I have not stopped breathing for a minute, I have no right to stop working. Even with one leg, I will walk the revolutionary path! If my hands and legs are completely disabled, I still have a mouth. I will use it every day to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, inspire comrades, and strike the enemy.
	* Although my body is disabled, my spirit is not. As long as I am devoted to the revolution, I can play the role of a small screw, dedicating my second life given by the Party to the Party, forever devoting myself to serving the people.
	* Although I am disabled, thinking that I can still work for the Party makes me happy!
	* Although I have only one leg, I will stride forward on the revolutionary path with one leg!

    干革命靠的是毛泽东思想
    ——王裕昌同志日记、谈话摘录
    昨天，我们发表了题为《关心战士就是关心革命》的通讯，介绍了毛主席的好战士、爱兵模范王裕昌同志的英雄事迹。今天，再发表他的一部分日记和他平时的谈话摘录。从这里，我们可以进一步看到王裕昌同志对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无比热爱，看到他一心为革命，一心为人民，一不怕苦，二不怕死的优秀品质。通过这些日记和谈话摘录，可以帮助我们更好地了解王裕昌同志崇高的精神境界。　编者
    毛主席是我们心中的红太阳
    ＊人人都说太阳暖，比不上毛泽东思想暖；人人都说母亲亲，党比母亲更加亲！
    ＊毛主席啊！您的思想光辉，照得全世界人民心里亮堂堂，照得革命人民有力量，照得美帝吓破了胆，照得牛鬼蛇神一扫光！
    ＊毛主席，您是世界人民革命的舵手。为了支援世界人民的革命，您指向那里我就冲向那里。您要我去烧木炭，我就作张思德；要我去堵枪眼，我就去作黄继光……
    ＊毛泽东思想，处处代表着人民，替人民讲话，替人民做事。毛主席关怀着人民，人民的心贴着毛主席。
    ＊用毛泽东思想来指导我们进行社会主义建设，有无穷的智慧和力量；用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，去和敌人斗争最有战斗力。
    ＊人民有了毛泽东思想，什么原子弹都不怕。帝国主义和修正主义的原子弹加在一起，也对付不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民。
    ＊毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳，毛主席著作是革命战士的粮食。我们要天天学，永远学，学一辈子，用一辈子！
    ＊党就是我慈祥的母亲，毛主席就是我慈祥的父亲，是您教育培养了我，我才能为人民做了我应该做的一点事情。
    ＊阳光、空气、粮食，只能使人活着。毛泽东思想，还能给人智慧和力量，使人勇敢和勤劳。
    ＊有了毛泽东思想，才能觉悟高，方向明。船在大海里航行没有舵不行，革命战士要革命没有毛泽东思想不行。
    ＊只有认真读毛主席的书，思想武器才能掌握得牢，和敌人斗争才能打得准，才能打得狠！
    ＊要革命，就要学毛主席著作；要为人民服务，就要学《为人民服务》。
    ＊用毛泽东思想不断地来改造自己的思想，丢掉“我”字，干革命就不怕困难，不怕危险；有了困难，有了危险，你才能敢于冲上去和它作斗争。
    ＊读毛主席的书，给我增添了百倍力量，能够战胜一切困难。
    ＊学习毛主席著作，不仅要用脑子去钻研，而且要时时刻刻用行动去体现。
    ＊干革命就要读毛主席的书。革命一辈子就要读一辈子毛主席的书，就要宣传一辈子毛泽东思想。
    毫不利己，全心全意为人民服务
    ＊要对党、对人民有所贡献，要作一个名副其实的共产党员，首先必须坚决抛弃个人的一切私心杂念，毫不利己专门利人，用实际行动做到全心全意为人民服务。
    ＊一个革命者，一个共产党员，能不能把个人利益绝对地、无条件地服从党的利益，是考验一个党员是否忠于党、忠于革命、忠于共产主义事业的标准。
    ＊每个人都应该把党的利益放在第一位，脑子里不能装半点“私”字。
    ＊为革命而生，为革命而死，不为名，不为利，一心为人民，一切为人民，勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业，忠忠诚诚地去为党为人民工作，去斗争，这是人生最大的快乐，最大的幸福。
    ＊一个人的能力有大小，我能够尽自己的一切力量为革命工作，就是最大的快乐。
    ＊我觉得用自己的一点劳动，能为提高部队战斗力作出一分贡献，这是我最快乐的事。
    ＊为人民服务就得服从党的需要，党叫干啥就干啥。
    ＊只要能为人民服务，让我干什么都行！
    ＊一切从人民利益出发，一切服从组织决定！
    ＊我们到部队来，为的是干革命。干革命就不能比荣誉、地位，要比对人民的贡献。
    ＊我们应该要真正的进步，要真正的荣誉。真正的荣誉不在形式上，而在思想上，那就是毛泽东思想最多，阶级觉悟最高。
    ＊全心全意为人民服务，那就不能有一丝假。只有这样，才能做到视死如归，刀山火海也敢闯！
    ＊一个革命者的生命是属于党和人民的，自己对残废、死亡，是没有权利考虑的。
    ＊我们如果为人民、为党做一点有益的事，这是应尽的义务。为了人民的利益，就是牺牲了，也是应该的。
    ＊我们要坚决和全世界人民站在一起，为支援世界人民，打败美帝国主义，贡献出一切力量！“我们的干部要关心每一个战士”
    ＊热爱同志，就是热爱革命。人民的幸福，就是我的幸福；同志们的幸福，就是我的幸福！
    ＊我们的干部要关心每一个战士，环境越是艰苦，我们越要关心。
    ＊党把培养革命接班人的任务交给了我们，我们要像战士的亲人那样关心他们。
    ＊人民把他们的子弟辛辛苦苦培养成人，交给了部队。我们是带兵的人，要是不很好关心他们，在他们遇险时可能救护而不去救护他们，就对不起党，对不起人民，对不起阶级兄弟。就不能算一个革命干部和共产党员！
    ＊革命同志的损失，就是革命的损失，就是牺牲自己，也要去救他！如果能以自己的死换取同志的活，我觉得死得有价值。
    为革命而生，为革命而死
    ＊为了革命，我可以献出自己的一切。为了革命，为了人民，就是牺牲了，也是光荣的！
    ＊为了人民利益，就是粉身碎骨也心甘情愿！
    ＊一个人活得有没有价值，不在生命长短，主要看他对党是不是忠诚，对人民有没有贡献。刘胡兰、董存瑞、黄继光都很年轻，但他们是“生的伟大，死的光荣”。
    ＊毛主席讲，对于病，要有坚强的斗争意志。疾病对于一个革命战士来说，并没有什么可怕，可怕的是意志不坚强。
    ＊毛泽东思想给了我无穷的力量，我一定要发扬革命乐观主义精神，战胜一切疾病，早日恢复健康，和同志们一起战斗。
    ＊我失去了右手和右腿，我还有左手和左腿，更重要的是我还有一颗为人民服务的心。只要我一分钟没有停止呼吸，我就没有权利停止工作。只剩一条腿，也走革命路！万一我的手和腿全坏了，我还有一张嘴，我要用它天天去宣传毛泽东思想，用它去鼓舞同志，打击敌人。
    ＊我的身体虽然残废了，但是身残志不残。只要一心为革命，就一定能够起一颗小螺丝钉的作用，把党给我的第二次生命，毫无保留地献给党，永远投入到为人民服务之中去。
    ＊自己虽然残废了，但想到还能为党工作，就感到愉快！
    ＊我虽然只有一条腿了，一条腿也要在革命大道上阔步前进！
