		The organ newspaper of the Chilean Revolutionary Communist Party, *El Spartacus*, published an article titled "Study Mao Zedong Thought" in its recently released third issue. The article emphasizes that "the more revisionists betray Marxism-Leninism and the more they fear and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, the more revolutionaries need to study Mao Zedong Thought and the more they must promote Mao Zedong Thought among the working people."

		The article states, "Currently, China is conducting a great mass movement to promote revolutionary thought and establish new thought and consciousness. This movement is the movement to study Mao Zedong Thought."

		The article points out, "The Chinese revolution is the greatest contribution made by the Chinese people to the development of revolutionary thought," because the Chinese revolution is "conducted on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought."

		The article also discusses the great significance of Mao Zedong's works for the revolutionary people of the world. The article says: "Revolutionaries around the world studying Mao Zedong's works can better understand the objective laws of history and arm themselves in class struggle, anti-imperialist struggle, and people's war. Studying Mao Zedong's works can help them identify their enemies, help them know who to oppose and who to unite with, help them rely on the masses and be self-reliant, help them unite revolutionary people, oppose revisionism, despise the enemy, and dare to struggle."

		The article points out that the movement to study Mao Zedong's works is to highlight Mao Zedong Thought, and highlighting Mao Zedong Thought means "highlighting politics, highlighting the dictatorship of the proletariat, highlighting class struggle, highlighting the dialectical materialist worldview; it means placing revolutionary thought at the forefront of the revolution; it means highlighting great revolutionary ideals and revolutionary moral spirit. If it is not like this, then bourgeois thought, habits, and morals will take their place. Under the control of this ideological consciousness, the revolution cannot be consolidated, and similarly, the revolution in other regions of the world cannot be developed and consolidated."

		The article points out, "Mao Zedong Thought led the Chinese revolution to victory. Today, the Chinese people use Mao Zedong Thought to build socialism and wage the struggle against American imperialism. Revolutionary people of all countries are now united around Mao Zedong Thought because Mao Zedong Thought is a scientific revolutionary theory, it is contemporary Marxism-Leninism." The article says, "Revolutionary theory is a precious weapon in the hands of the people of all countries, an indispensable tool for carrying out revolutionary activities."

		The article also provides many vivid examples, introducing the situation of the broad masses of the Chinese people actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, explaining that the achievements made by the Chinese people in all aspects are the result of studying Chairman Mao's works. The article also points out, "The movement to study Mao Zedong's works in China also provides us with an exemplary method of study."

    智利革命共产党机关报发表文章指出
    一切革命者都要学习和宣传毛泽东思想
    突出毛泽东思想就是突出政治，突出无产阶级专政，突出阶级斗争
    新华社圣地亚哥电智利革命共产党机关报《斯巴达克报》在最近出版的第三期上刊登了一篇题为《学习毛泽东思想》的文章。文章强调指出，“修正主义者越是背叛马克思列宁主义，越是害怕和反对毛泽东思想，革命者就越是需要学习毛泽东思想，越是要在劳动人民中间宣传毛泽东思想。”
    文章说，“中国目前正在进行一场发扬革命思想，树立新思想、新意识的伟大的群众运动。这个运动就是学习毛泽东思想的运动。”
    文章指出，“中国革命是中国人民对发展革命思想作出的最伟大贡献”，因为中国革命是“在毛泽东思想的基础上进行的”。
    文章还谈到毛泽东著作对于世界革命人民的重大意义。文章说：“全世界革命者学习毛泽东著作，可以更好地了解历史的客观规律，并且在阶级斗争、反帝斗争和人民战争中武装自己。学习毛泽东著作，可以帮助他们去识别自己的敌人，帮助他们知道反对谁和团结谁，帮助他们依靠群众和自力更生，帮助他们团结革命人民、反对修正主义、蔑视敌人和敢于斗争。”
    文章指出，学习毛泽东著作运动是要突出毛泽东思想，而突出毛泽东思想就“意味着突出政治，突出无产阶级专政，突出阶级斗争，突出辩证唯物主义的世界观；意味着把革命思想放在革命的首位；意味着突出伟大的革命理想和革命的道德精神。如果不是这样，那末，资产阶级的思想、习惯和道德就会取而代之，在这种思想意识支配下，革命不可能得到巩固，同样，世界其他地区的革命也不可能开展和得到巩固。”
    文章指出，“毛泽东思想引导中国革命取得了胜利，今天中国人民运用毛泽东思想进行社会主义建设和开展反对美帝国主义斗争。世界各国革命人民现在都团结在毛泽东思想的周围，因为毛泽东思想是科学的革命理论，是当代的马克思列宁主义。”文章说，“革命理论是各国人民手中的珍贵武器，是开展革命活动的必不可少的工具。”
    文章还举出很多生动的例子，介绍了中国广大群众活学活用毛主席著作的情况，说明中国人民在各个方面取得的成就，都是学习毛主席著作的结果。文章还指出，“中国的学习毛泽东著作的运动也为我们提供了一个学习方法的榜样。”
