The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Lao Patriotic Front Support Our Firm Stance and Resolutely Fight Alongside the Chinese People to Defeat the American Aggressors

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported: The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's Foreign Liaison Committee issued a statement on the 19th, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' brazen dispatch of aircraft into Chinese airspace to carry out bandit attacks, a blatant act of war provocation.

The statement pointed out that the new crimes committed by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people prove that it continues to pursue a policy of hostility towards China and expanding the war of aggression in Indochina and Asia, in a vain attempt to salvage its failures in the aggression against South Vietnam.

The statement said that the people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam express great indignation and strong condemnation of this brazen act of war provocation by U.S. imperialism.

The statement concluded by saying that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fully supports the stance of the Government of the People's Republic of China as stated in the statement issued by the Ministry of National Defense on September 16, and sternly warns U.S. imperialism: its provocations against China will not save it from its failures in Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam and the liberation armed forces are willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army of China to resolutely frustrate all the plots and actions of U.S. imperialist aggression.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Khamkeut, the Pathet Lao radio broadcast that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on the 20th, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' brazen dispatch of military aircraft into the airspace of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China on September 5, 9, and 17, to carry out bandit attacks.

The statement said that the Lao Patriotic Front and the Lao people fully support the strong protests issued by the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China on September 16 and 17.

The statement concluded by saying that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of Laos and China, and the Lao people are willing to stand forever with the great Chinese people, to fight to the end to defeat the American aggressors and achieve a complete victory.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Melbourne, the official newspaper of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), the *Vanguard*, published an article on the 21st, condemning the recent serious war provocations by U.S. imperialism against China.

The article pointed out: This is "naked aggression and provocation" by U.S. imperialism, "part of a plan to launch a large-scale war against China." The article said that this proves that "U.S. imperialism is stubbornly trying to escalate tensions in order to prepare for an expansion of the Vietnam War."
