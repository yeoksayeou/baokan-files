In the Pingdingshan mining area of Henan, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is becoming a powerful force driving coal mine production and construction. The broad revolutionary masses of workers in this mine, taking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the guiding principle, are seizing the revolution and promoting production, making the entire mine brimming with revolutionary fervor and presenting a new situation of all-around leaps forward.

A few years ago, this mine was still at the bottom of the national coal industry. Since the socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the ideological transformation of the broad masses of workers has been greatly promoted. The workers, with sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm, have launched a new high tide of production and construction. They have made the same mine, with a significantly reduced workforce, achieve a significant increase in production.

In the first eight months of this year compared to the same period in 1963, the mine's production capacity increased by 47%, the output of raw coal increased by 51.37%, the efficiency of the entire workforce increased by 108.89%, and the cost of raw coal decreased by 25.54%. Among them, the main technical and economic indicators of some mines have already reached the advanced level nationwide.

The workers of Pingdingshan Coal Mine hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to challenge, and criticize many unreasonable rules and regulations, situations that do not emphasize proletarian politics, and all old ideas, old styles, old habits, and old forces in enterprise management. They have proposed a series of revolutionary new measures. To strengthen political and ideological work on the production site, some mines have reformed the labor organization; some units have implemented the practice of cadre workers going down to the mine to work; some units have implemented the practice of rotating engineering and technical personnel to work as workers. After implementing these measures, enterprise management has been significantly revolutionized. In terms of production technology, workers despise the "authority" of the bourgeoisie, dare to think, dare to do, dare to revolutionize, and dare to innovate, and are actively carrying out technological innovation and technological revolution. From last year to now, workers have proposed 1,100 innovation suggestions, of which 830 have been implemented, including 180 major innovations. The main machine of the coal cutter in Pingdingshan Mine No. 4 had an unreasonable design. Initially, some people thought that this coal cutter was a new technology of the 1960s and could only wait for the coal mine machinery research department to reform it. However, the workers of Mine No. 4 said: What's so great about the latest technology of the 1960s? If it's not reasonable, we must innovate! As a result, the workers of this mine successfully designed and reformed it in three days. Due to the success of a large number of technological innovation projects, the mechanization level of coal mine production has been effectively improved, and the technical appearance of the mine has been changed.

The broad masses of workers have injected all the sky-high enthusiasm aroused in the socialist education movement and the Cultural Revolution into coal mine production, making the entire mine emerge with countless new people and new things. Many people produce coal for the revolution, regardless of personal gains and losses. Some people bravely step forward in dangerous situations underground; some people climb up ten-meter-high power poles in strong winds to repair high-voltage lines; some people guard their posts underground in the face of mine power outages to ensure mine safety and quickly restore production.

Currently, the revolutionary workers of Pingdingshan Coal Mine are using the "Sixteen Articles" as a spiritual weapon, seizing the revolution with one hand and promoting production with the other, ensuring greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the new high tide of socialist construction.

    平顶山煤矿职工在文化大革命中积极破旧创新
    革命热气腾腾  生产全面跃进
    生产大幅度增长，成本大幅度下降，大批技术革新项目试验成功
    据新华社郑州九日电　在河南平顶山矿区，无产阶级文化大革命正在成为推动煤矿生产建设的巨大动力。这个煤矿的广大革命职工，以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，抓革命，促生产，使全矿到处都呈现出一片热气腾腾的革命景象和新的全面跃进的局面。
    这个矿几年前在全国煤矿工业中还居于下游地位。社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，极大地促进了广大职工的思想革命化，职工们以冲天的革命干劲，掀起生产建设的新高潮。他们使同样的矿井，在人员大大减少的情况下，生产却大幅度上升。
    今年前八个月与一九六三年同期比较，矿井生产能力提高了百分之四十七，原煤产量增长百分之五十一点三七，全员效率提高百分之一零八点八九，原煤成本下降了百分之二十五点五四。其中有的矿的主要技术经济指标已列入全国先进水平。
    平顶山煤矿职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢字当头，对许多不合理的规章制度，不突出无产阶级政治的情况，以及一切企业管理方面的旧思想、旧作风、旧习惯、旧势力，提出了尖锐的批判，提出了一系列革命化的新措施。为了加强生产现场的政治思想工作，有的矿改革了劳动组织；有些单位在基层干部中实行了下井跟班劳动；有的单位实行了工程技术人员轮流下放当工人。实行这些措施之后，显著地促进了企业管理革命化。在生产技术上，职工们蔑视资产阶级“权威”，敢想、敢干、敢革命、敢创造，大搞技术革新和技术革命。从去年到现在，职工们提出了一千一百项革新建议，已经实现了八百三十项，其中重大的革新有一百八十项。平顶山四矿的割煤机主机滚床设计不合理，开始有人认为这种割煤机是六十年代的新技术，只有等待煤矿机械研究部门来改革。但是四矿工人说：六十年代最新技术有啥了不起，只要不合理，咱就要闹革新！结果这个矿的职工在三天内就自己设计改革成功了。由于大批技术革新项目的试验成功，有效地提高了煤矿生产的机械化程度，改变了矿井技术面貌。
    广大职工把在社会主义教育运动和文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天干劲，全部注入到煤矿生产中去，使全矿涌现出无数生动的新人新事。许多人为革命出煤，不计个人得失，有的在井下艰险场合挺身而出；有的在狂风中爬上十几米高的电杆抢修高压线；有的在矿井停电的困难条件下，坚守井下岗位保证矿井安全，使生产迅速恢复。
    目前，平顶山煤矿革命职工正以十六条为精神武器，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，保证在文化大革命和社会主义生产建设新高潮中夺得更大的胜利。
