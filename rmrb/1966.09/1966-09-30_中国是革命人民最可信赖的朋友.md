I am a student from Indonesia. In our country, a large-scale white terror has occurred. Right-wing military personnel have carried out large-scale, inhumane persecution against communists and progressive individuals. American imperialism is gleefully applauding, and the Khrushchev revisionists have also played a very unseemly role in this event.

However, they may have rejoiced too soon! The glorious and great, people-loving, Marxist-Leninist Indonesian Communist Party will not collapse! Blood debts will be repaid with blood.

In this incident, the reactionaries have relentlessly slandered great China. However, we Indonesian people deeply understand that the Chinese government and people have always respected us and supported our revolutionary struggle. We are close comrades and comrades-in-arms. We have always believed that the Chinese Communist Party, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people are steadfast revolutionaries, the sworn enemies of the reactionaries, and the most reliable friends of the revolutionary people.

    中国是革命人民最可信赖的朋友
    〔印度尼西亚〕Ｋ．Ａ．
    我是一个印度尼西亚的学生。在我们国家里，发生了大规模的白色恐怖，右派军人对共产党人和进步人士进行了大规模的、惨无人道的迫害。美帝国主义高兴得拍手叫好，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也在这个事件中扮演了极不光采的角色。
    可是，他们未免高兴得太早了！光荣伟大的、受人民爱戴的、马列主义的印度尼西亚共产党是垮不了的！血债是要用血来偿还的。
    在这次事件中，反动派竭力诽谤伟大的中国。可是，我们印度尼西亚人民深深地懂得：中国政府和人民一向尊重我们，支援我们的革命斗争。我们是亲密的战友和同志。我们始终相信：以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党、中国政府和人民是坚定的革命派，是反动派的死对头，是革命人民最可信赖的好朋友。
