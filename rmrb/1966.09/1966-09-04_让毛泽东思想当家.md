In the streets of Liujia Village, Daguantun Commune, Cang County, Hebei Province, a golden Mao Chairman Quotation Board catches the eye, and many families have set up "study plots" for Chairman Mao's works on their walls.

The distinctive feature of Liujia Village's study of Chairman Mao's works is: the study is lively, and the application is effective. Study a bit, apply a bit, and let Mao Zedong Thought take the lead in every household.

In mid-March, during lunch, the accountant of the production team, Pang Guanlin, had a debate with his family of three. The issue was raised by Pang Guanlin.

"Being an official is really tough! It's hard work, and you offend people. I don't want to be the accountant anymore."

"Dad, your idea seems..." his daughter-in-law, Liu Dehong, wanted to refute her father-in-law but felt it might not be appropriate.

His son, Pang Caiyao, spoke up confidently: "Offending people depends on who you offend. If you offend the poor and lower-middle peasants, it shows you haven't served the people well; if you offend landlords and rich peasants, these class enemies, it shows you've done the right thing. Chairman Mao said, 'Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.' As long as you have a red heart for the revolution, you won't be afraid of offending people."

At this point, Liu Dehong also spoke up to her father-in-law: "Norman Bethune came from afar to help the Chinese revolution. What's a little hard work for you? Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that all cadres are servants of the people and should serve the people wholeheartedly. Why do you care about personal gains and losses?"

The young couple's words finally made Pang Guanlin realize his mistake. In the afternoon, he wrote a self-criticism and posted it on the family's "study plot."

Now, this village has over a hundred households that have set up family "study plots," displaying study notes, praise and criticism, challenges, and responses.

Female community member Zhang Lanying sometimes picks and chooses her work in the team, not caring about quality. During a family life meeting, her thirteen-year-old daughter, Pang Caijun, criticized her: "Others like Norman Bethune do revolutionary work selflessly and for the benefit of others, but you push the heavy tasks onto others, only caring about earning work points and not about the quality of the farm work. How did you learn 'In Service of the People'?"

These words made Zhang Lanying feel embarrassed, thinking, "I was wrong, others criticizing me is understandable, but even my own daughter..." She was about to scold Caijun, but Chairman Mao's words echoed in her mind: "Because we are servants of the people, we should not be afraid of criticism. No matter who points out our mistakes, as long as you are right, we will correct them." Thus, Zhang Lanying humbly admitted, "Mother was wrong, I accept the criticism, and I will learn from you in the future."

The village also has a story about Yueying teaching her mother. Twelve-year-old Li Yueying studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "After the armed enemies are eliminated, the unarmed enemies still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." Reflecting on her mother's visit to the landlord Pang Zitong's home, she advised her mother: "Mother, don't go to Pang Zitong's home anymore." Her mother, not understanding, said: "Visiting Aunt Tong's home is no big deal." Yueying got angry and said: "She is not Aunt Tong, she is a landlord's wife! Have you forgotten that Chairman Mao told us to distinguish between enemies and friends. We are poor peasants, how can we not distinguish between landlords and ourselves?" Saying this, she took out "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and studied it with her mother. Chairman Mao's teachings made her mother recall the landlord's vicious heart, and she excitedly said: "We will listen to Chairman Mao's words and definitely cut ties with the landlords!"

Mao Zedong Thought is indeed the red sun, shining brightly wherever it goes!

Editor's Note

This small article is well worth reading. It reflects that under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the spiritual outlook of our peasants is undergoing profound changes. On this basis, a new type of revolutionary family relationship is being established.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work and is also the guiding principle for handling family relationships. Among family members, whoever's words align with Mao Zedong Thought, we listen; whoever's words do not align with Mao Zedong Thought, we do not listen.

The closeness between families should not just be personal closeness but should be class closeness. From the perspective of class interests, using Mao Zedong Thought to handle relationships between families, this is the true closeness.

Many stories from Liujia Village show that in households where Mao Zedong Thought takes the lead, the household is full of vigor and has a new look, becoming an active member of the socialist collective. Every household of the working people lets Mao Zedong Thought take the lead, and the country will have a unified ideology.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, family relationships must also undergo a great revolution, letting Mao Zedong Thought take the lead!

    让毛泽东思想当家
    尹洪月　章义达　杨维凯　李方占
    河北省沧县大官厅公社刘贾村的街头上，金光闪耀的毛主席语录牌引人注目，许多人家的墙壁上，办起了毛主席著作“学习园地”。
    刘贾村群众学习毛主席著作的特点是：学的活，用的好，学一点，用一点，家家户户让毛泽东思想当家。
    三月下旬的一个中午，生产队会计庞观林一家三口展开了一场辩论。问题是由庞观林提出的。
    “当干部真不容易呀！受累大，得罪人，我不想当会计了。”
    “爹，你这想法好像……”儿媳刘德香想反驳公公，又怕不太合适。
    儿子庞彩耀理直气壮地说：“得罪人，要看得罪什么人。如果得罪了贫下中农，就证明你没有很好为人民服务；如果得罪了地主、富农这些阶级敌人，就证明你做对了。毛主席说过，‘被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事’，只要你有一颗为革命的红心，就不怕得罪人。”
    这时，刘德香也撕破了情面，向公公说：“白求恩不远万里来帮助中国革命，你受点累算什么？毛主席一再教导我们，一切工作干部都是人民的勤务员，要全心全意为人民服务，你怎么计较个人得失呢？”
    小两口你一言，我一语，终于使庞观林认识了错误，午后写了一份检讨书，贴在家庭“学习园地”上。
    现在，这个村已有一百多户办起了家庭“学习园地”，里面张贴了学习心得、表扬批评、挑战和应战。
    女社员张兰英在队上干活有时挑肥拣瘦，不顾质量，在一次家庭生活会上，十三岁的女儿庞彩俊批评她：“人家白求恩干革命毫不利己专门利人，你却把重担子推给人家，光顾挣工分，不顾农活质量，你怎么学的《为人民服务》哪？”一席话，把张兰英批评得怪难为情的，心想：“我做错了，别人批评还可以，可是自己的闺女也……”她刚想责备彩俊，毛主席的话又响在耳边：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。不管是什么人，谁向我们指出都行。只要你说得对，我们就改正。”于是，张兰英就虚心地检查说：“娘做错了，接受批评，今后向你学习。”
    这个村还流传着一个月英教母的故事。十二岁的李月英学习了毛主席的教导：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”回想起母亲到地主庞子桐家串门的事，便劝告母亲：“娘，你别再上庞子桐家去了。”母亲不解其意地说：“到你桐奶奶家坐会要嘛紧？”月英生气地说：“她不是桐奶奶，是地主婆！你忘了，毛主席让我们分清谁是敌人，谁是朋友。咱是贫农，怎么和地主分不开家呢？”说着，又拿起《中国社会各阶级的分析》和母亲一起学。毛主席的教导，使她母亲想起地主的狠毒心肠，激动地说：“咱听毛主席的话，一定和地主一刀两断！”
    毛泽东思想真是红太阳，照到哪里哪里亮！
    编后
    这篇小文章，很值得一读。它反映了在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我国农民的精神面貌正在发生深刻的变化。在这个基础上，一种新型的、革命的家庭关系，正在建立起来。
    毛泽东思想，是我们一切工作的指导方针，也是处理家庭关系的指导方针。一家人当中，谁的话符合毛泽东思想，就听，不符合毛泽东思想，就不听。
    家庭之间的亲，不应当只是个人的亲，更应该是阶级的亲。从阶级的利益出发，用毛泽东思想来处理家庭之间的关系，这才是真正的亲。
    刘贾村的许多故事说明，哪家由毛泽东思想来当家，哪家就朝气蓬勃，气象一新，就成为社会主义大集体中的一个积极的成员。每个劳动人民的家庭都由毛泽东思想当家，全国就有了统一的思想。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，家庭关系也要来个大革命，让毛泽东思想当家！
