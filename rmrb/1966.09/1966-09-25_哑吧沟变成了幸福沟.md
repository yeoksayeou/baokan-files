My hometown is in Anhui Province, Jinzhai County, in a place called the Silent Valley. After liberation, under the sun of the Party, the people, the mountains, and the rivers of the Silent Valley have been changing constantly. In July 1953, the "Silent Valley" was renamed "Valley of Happiness."

This spring festival, I returned home to visit my relatives and saw that the people of the Valley of Happiness have an infinite deep affection for Chairman Mao's works. They resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions. Poor peasant community member Jiang Huidong, who previously could not read, started studying Chairman Mao's works with everyone in the spring of 1963. He understood the revolutionary principle of serving the people. Last winter, when the production team had a calf, Jiang Huidong would carry firewood and bedding to the cow shed every evening to warm the calf. His wife complained that he did not take care of his health, but he said, "Now the commune is my home, and the oxen are my business! We must protect this collective property as if it were our own, and do more selfless deeds for the collective. This is the duty of us poor peasants."

Now, the people of the Valley of Happiness are following Chairman Mao's instructions to make a great revolution. In just 1964 and 1965, the community members of the Valley of Happiness built five large and small reservoirs, opened up more than 150 mu of terraced fields, and planted forests on the mountains. The grain yield per mu is around 1,000 jin, and there is always surplus grain to sell to the state. The people of the Valley of Happiness sing in a new folk song:

	Silent Valley, Silent Valley,
	The clouds have parted to reveal the sun.
	The Party's sunlight shines everywhere,
	The spring of happiness flows endlessly.
	The rice fields are golden waves,
	The granaries are piled high like mountains.
	Men, women, old, and young smile with joy,
	Happiness in their hearts and smiles on their faces.
	The three red banners fly in the wind,
	The Silent Valley has become the Valley of Happiness.

    哑吧沟变成了幸福沟
    解放军某部　吴明录
    我的家乡在安徽省金寨县哑吧沟。解放后，在党的阳光普照下，哑吧沟的人，哑吧沟的山，哑吧沟的水，在不断变化。一九五三年七月，“哑吧沟”也改名为“幸福沟”了。
    今年春节，我回家探亲，看到幸福沟的人民对毛主席著作有着无限深厚的感情，他们坚决听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事。贫农社员江汇东，从前不识字，从一九六三年春开始，他和大家一起学习毛主席著作，懂得了为人民服务的革命道理。去年冬天，生产队下牛犊，江汇东每天天黑就挑着木柴，卷着铺盖到牛屋里给牛犊烤火。老伴怨他不爱护身体，他说：“如今公社就是俺的家，耕牛就是俺的家业！这集体的财产，俺们要看它比自己还要紧，多做毫不利己专门利人的事，是俺贫农的本份。”
    现在幸福沟人民正按照毛主席的指示，大闹革命。仅一九六四年、一九六五年里，幸福沟社员就修筑了大小水库五座，新开辟一百五十多亩梯田，山上山下树木成林。粮食亩产都在一千斤左右，年年都有余粮卖给国家。幸福沟的人们，在一首新歌谣里唱道：哑吧沟呀哑吧沟，拨开乌云见日头。党的阳光普天照，幸福泉水不断流。稻田里面黄金浪，场上粮堆赛山头。男女老少笑颜开，喜在心头笑出口。三面红旗迎风飘，哑吧沟变幸福沟。
