According to Xinhua News Agency in Yinchuan on the 15th, the broad masses of cadres and community members in Ningxia's Yellow River Irrigation Area are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, combining revolution with production, and this autumn's crops are growing very well. The transplanted rice is growing uniformly and robustly, with full and plump grains. The sorghum and corn are tall with large ears. The replanted foxtail millet and proso millet are a vibrant green. The broad masses of Hui and Han community members are happily saying: This autumn's crops are growing even better than the bumper harvest year of 1965.
