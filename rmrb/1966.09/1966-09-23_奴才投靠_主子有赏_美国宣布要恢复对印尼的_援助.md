The decision by the right-wing military regime in Indonesia to rejoin the United Nations has been praised by the U.S. government.

The day after this decision was announced, U.S. State Department spokesman McCloskey hurriedly stated that the United States intends to resume economic "aid" to this regime to encourage it to further align with U.S. imperialism.

On the 20th, McCloskey, in a press conference discussing Indonesia's return to the United Nations, gleefully said: "The path to resuming aid to Indonesia is now clear, and we hope to have specific discussions with the Indonesians (referring to the right-wing military regime in Indonesia) on these matters."

On the same day, the British and Japanese governments also formally expressed their welcome to this decision by the right-wing military regime in Indonesia.

    美国宣布要恢复对印尼的“援助”
    新华社二十一日讯　华盛顿消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权关于印尼重新回到联合国的决定受到了美国政府的赞赏。
    在这一决定宣布的第二天，美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基就赶紧表示，美国打算恢复对这个政权的经济“援助”，以鼓励它进一步投靠美帝国主义。
    麦克洛斯基在二十日的记者招待会上谈到印尼重返联合国的问题时兴高采烈地说：“恢复对印度尼西亚的援助的道路现在已经畅通了，我们希望就这些事情同印度尼西亚人（按指印尼右派军人政权）进行具体的讨论。”
    同一天，英国和日本政府也正式表示欢迎印尼右派军人政权的这一决定。
