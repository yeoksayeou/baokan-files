Hunan's early and middle rice harvests have seen significant increases this year. The province's broad masses of commune members are, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, using the spirit of continuous revolution to vigorously launch an anti-drought campaign, striving for increased late rice production.

Since the beginning of autumn, many places in Hunan Province have experienced droughts and pest infestations. Under the inspiration of the spirit of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the broad masses of rural cadres and commune members have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. They are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, mustering revolutionary enthusiasm, and fighting against the droughts and pests that threaten the growth of late rice. To ensure increased late rice production, the party and government leadership organs in many regions have organized large numbers of cadres to go to the production front lines, strengthening leadership over the cultivation and management of late rice.
