Our friends are everywhere. Friends from various countries and regions of the five continents who came to participate in the celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China have been arriving in Beijing in recent days, receiving warm welcomes from revolutionary masses from all walks of life in the capital.

By today, friends from dozens of countries and regions across the five continents have arrived in Beijing amidst the new high tide of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have brought the deep friendship of the peoples of the world to the Chinese people, and their boundless love for Chairman Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought. Many foreign friends, as soon as they stepped off the plane, told their Chinese hosts that they had long yearned to come to Beijing, the center of the world revolution, to be by the side of the great leader of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao, to see with their own eyes the thriving revolutionary scene in China through the Cultural Revolution, and to celebrate the festival together with the Chinese people.

Among the many foreign friends gathered in our great motherland's capital, some bought "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" on their way to Beijing and began to read them seriously during their journey. Some, upon arriving in Beijing, happily pinned badges with Chairman Mao's portrait on their chests. Some hurried to Tiananmen Square, standing for a long time in front of the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, expressing their admiration for the great leader. Some, filled with passion, sang to the Chinese revolutionary masses songs praising the great leader Mao Zedong, such as "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

In recent days, the entire city of Beijing has been filled with an atmosphere of internationalist friendship and joy.

    新华社二十九日讯　我们的朋友遍天下。从世界五大洲前来参加中华人民共和国成立十七周年庆祝活动的各国朋友，这几天来陆续云集北京，受到首都各界革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    到今天为止，已经有各大洲几十个国家和地区的朋友们，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中到达北京。他们给中国人民带来了世界各地人民的深厚情谊，带来了他们对毛泽东主席和毛泽东思想的无限热爱。许多外国朋友一下飞机就对中国主人说，他们早就渴望着来到世界革命的中心北京，来到世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席身边，来亲眼看一看中国通过文化大革命出现的一派热气腾腾的革命景象，同中国人民一起共庆节日。
    在云集我们伟大祖国首都的许多外国朋友中，有的在来北京的途中购买了《毛泽东选集》，在旅途中就认真地阅读起来。有的到达北京之后，高兴地把镶有毛主席头像的纪念章挂在胸前。有的赶忙来到天安门广场，久久地站在毛主席的巨幅画像面前，表达他们对伟大领袖的仰慕心情。有的满怀激情，向中国革命群众学唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》等歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲。
    这几天来，北京全城到处洋溢着一片国际主义的友好欢乐气氛。
