I am a new soldier who enlisted this year. When I first arrived at the unit, I always thought: Young people have strength and enthusiasm, so no matter how big the difficulty, we can endure it. Later, when the company conducted a field training exercise, at that time, my foot was injured and I had just returned from the medical team. On the first day, I walked more than sixty li, and my legs were sore and painful, with blisters on my feet. I began to feel discouraged. The next day, I heard that we had to climb a high and steep mountain, and my heart sank. The platoon leader found out and studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with me. We read and pondered it repeatedly. The great image of Comrade Zhang Side moved me. Comrade Zhang Side endured hardships in such a difficult environment, climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands with Chairman Mao, traversing thousands of mountains and rivers, and experiencing countless hardships. Yet, he never complained about the hardships and toiled selflessly for the people. What are my minor difficulties compared to that! After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I understood that suffering for the people is the greatest joy and happiness, and serving the people is the greatest honor. My heart was filled with boundless courage and strength.

The next day, during the march, whenever I encountered difficulties, I would take out "In Memory of Norman Bethune" from my bag. When I read "Our comrades must learn to look at things in all their aspects, looking at the difficulties together with the possibility of overcoming them...", all my fatigue seemed to vanish into thin air, and I was full of energy. The mountain seemed much lower. I made up my mind not to yield to difficulties and finally overcame them, successfully completing the training mission.

    一心为人民就能排除万难
    战士  黄胜丙
    我是今年入伍的新战士，刚到部队，心里总是想：青年人，力气大，干劲足，再大的困难也能顶得住。后来连队举行野营训练，那时我脚摔伤刚从卫生队回来，第一天走了六十多里，两腿又痠又痛，脚上又起了血泡，我心里就产生了畏难的情绪。第二天，听说要爬又高又陡的大山，我的心就凉了。班长知道了，就跟我一起学习《为人民服务》。反复地读，反复地琢磨，张思德同志的高大形象感动了我。张思德同志在那样艰苦的环境下，跟毛主席一起爬雪山，过草地，越千山，涉万水，历尽了千辛万苦，可是他从来没有叫一声苦和累，忠心耿耿地为人民服务。我这点小困难还算得什么！我学了《为人民服务》，懂得了为人民吃苦是最大的愉快和幸福，为人民服务是最大的光荣，心里顿时增添了无限的勇气和力量。
    第二天，在行军途中，一遇到困难，我就从挂包里掏出《为人民服务》。当我读到“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”的时候，我全身的疲劳全跑到九霄云外去了，满身是劲，山也好像低了很多。我下定决心，在困难面前决不低头，终于征服了困难，胜利完成了训练任务。
