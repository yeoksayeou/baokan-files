The revolutionary situation is excellent on the industrial and agricultural fronts, with good news pouring in.

Emancipated peasants dare to break old customs and superstitions as the plateau of Tibet reaps a bumper harvest.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 18: The emancipated peasants of Tibet have seized the opportunity of the revolution to promote production, achieving the eighth consecutive bumper harvest since the democratic reform.

Currently, the vast plateau is a scene of bumper harvests. From the situation in various places, it can be seen that this year, whether in the river valleys and plains or in the high and cold regions, whether winter or spring crops, the yield has increased significantly compared to last year. In regions like Shigatse and Ngari, where the season is relatively late, the crops are generally growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

The thoughts of Mao Zedong have become a tremendous material force on the Tibetan plateau. The rural bumper harvest this year is the result of the broad masses of Tibetan emancipated peasants studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In the western part of Tibet, Ali, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and high and cold terrain, the emancipated peasants, after studying Chairman Mao's works, vowed to be the new Yu Gong of socialism. Despite the frozen ground several feet deep, they reclaimed a large amount of wasteland from under the ice and snow, increasing the sowing area in this region by 24 percent compared to last year. In production, the emancipated peasants dared to break with the old customs and superstitions left over from the feudal serf society, making bold attempts to innovate in agricultural technology and improve farm tools, significantly improving production.

    文化大革命形势好工农业战线传捷报
    翻身农民“敢”字当头大破陈规陋习
    西藏万里高原一片丰收景象
    据新华社拉萨十八日电　西藏翻身农民抓革命促生产，夺得民主改革以来的第八个丰收年。
    目前，万里高原一片丰收景象。从各地收打的情况看，今年西藏无论河谷平原还是高寒地区，无论冬播作物还是春播作物，产量较去年都有较大幅度的增长。季节较晚的日喀则、阿里等地区，庄稼也普遍长得好，丰收在望。
    毛泽东思想在西藏高原上已变为巨大的物质力量。农村今年喜获丰收，就是广大藏族翻身农民活学活用毛主席著作的结果。西藏西部的阿里，雪山环抱，地势高寒。这里的翻身农民学习毛主席著作后，誓当社会主义的新愚公。他们不顾地冻数尺，从冰峰雪山下开垦出大批荒地，使这个地区的播种面积比去年增加百分之二十四。在生产中，翻身农民“敢”字当头，大破封建农奴制社会遗留下来的陈规陋习，在农业技术和改良农具方面进行了破旧立新的尝试，使生产有了显著的提高。
