Chairman Mao said: “The various irreconcilable contradictions within and outside the country are like a volcano, threatening American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano.”

The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries not only surround American imperialism with the encirclement of the peoples of the world, making it precarious day by day, but also intensify the contradictions between American imperialism and other imperialist powers, accelerating the disintegration of the imperialist camp.

As the paper tiger of American imperialism is exposed, the era of the United States issuing orders to its allies has gone forever. The contradictions within the imperialist camp have reached an unprecedentedly sharp level. Western European countries, especially France, are engaged in fierce competition for hegemony with the United States. Since this year, due to a series of measures taken by France, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which the United States has painstakingly built up for nearly twenty years, is accelerating its collapse. The Central Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, both of which are controlled by the United States or have direct U.S. participation, have become paralyzed or exist in name only due to the centrifugal forces within these member countries.

Facing various crises that are pressing in from all sides and unprecedented isolation internationally, American imperialism and the Johnson administration are also surrounded by the American people at home. The movement of the broad masses of the American people against the aggression in Vietnam is surging, and the struggle of the black people for their rights is developing rapidly, increasingly taking the path of violent struggle. The people's movement, the black people's movement, and the workers' movement are gradually merging into a powerful current of the American people opposing their own imperialism, launching an assault on American imperialism. As acknowledged by American bourgeois politicians and the press, the United States has become “an isolated globalist nation.”

    帝国主义阵营分崩离析
    毛主席说：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就像一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”
    各国人民的革命斗争风暴不仅使美帝国主义陷入世界人民的重重包围之中，朝不保夕，而且也在加剧美帝国主义同其他帝国主义之间的矛盾，加速帝国主义阵营的分崩离析。
    随着美帝国主义纸老虎原形毕露，美国在它的盟国中发号施令的时代，已经一去不复返了。帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾发展到了空前尖锐的程度。西欧国家，特别是法国，同美国展开了剧烈的争逐霸权的斗争。今年以来，由于法国采取的一系列措施，美国苦心经营了近二十年的北大西洋军事集团正在加速土崩瓦解。由美国控制或有美国直接参加的中央条约组织和东南亚条约组织两个军事集团，在这些集团成员国离心离德的情况下，已经陷于瘫痪或者名存实亡。
    在国际上处于各种危机交相煎迫，空前孤立的美帝国主义和约翰逊政府，在国内也处在美国人民的重重包围之中，美国广大人民反对侵越战争的运动逐浪高涨，黑人争取切身权利的斗争急剧发展，越来越走上暴力斗争的道路。人民运动、黑人运动、工人运动，正在逐步汇合在一起，形成美国人民反对本国帝国主义的一股巨流，向美帝国主义进行冲击。正如美国资产阶级政客和报刊所承认的，美国“成了一个孤立的全球主义大国”。
