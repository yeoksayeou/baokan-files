The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Seamen's Union strongly protest the U.S. imperialists' crime of bombing our cargo ship, killing and injuring 16 of our seamen. The Chinese people will not be bullied; blood debts must be repaid.

BEIJING, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement today, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialists' outrageous act of bombing our cargo ship and killing and injuring 16 of our seamen.

The statement said, while the U.S. imperialists are escalating their aggression against Vietnam, they have been continuously bombing and strafing our fishing boats and cargo ships. This is a mad provocation of war against the Chinese people. We clearly tell the U.S. imperialists that the Chinese people are not afraid. No matter what the U.S. imperialists do, the Chinese people will definitely firmly support the Vietnamese people to the end, definitely support the anti-U.S. struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world, and definitely, together with the revolutionary people of the world, carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys through to the end.

The All-China Seamen's Union today also issued a statement on this serious incident, seriously warning the U.S. aggressors that Chinese seamen and the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be bullied. Every debt of blood that U.S. imperialism owes the Chinese people will be repaid. If the U.S. imperialists dare to impose war on the Chinese people, the Chinese seamen and the Chinese people will definitely annihilate the U.S. aggressors completely, thoroughly, and cleanly, and together with the people of the world, make our contribution to the final burial of U.S. imperialism.

    我全总和海员工会最强烈抗议美帝轰炸我国货船的罪行
    中国人民不可侮　血债一定要偿还
    新华社六日讯　中华全国总工会今天发表声明，最强烈地抗议美帝国主义悍然轰炸我国货船、炸死炸伤我海员十六人的滔天罪行。
    声明说，美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，不断对我渔船、货船进行轰炸扫射，这是对中国人民进行疯狂的战争挑衅。我们明白地告诉美帝国主义，中国人民是吓不倒的，不管美帝国主义还要干什么，中国人民一定要坚决支援越南人民打到底，一定要支援全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的反美斗争，一定要同全世界革命人民一起，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底。
    中国海员工会全国委员会今天就这一严重事件发表声明，严重警告美国侵略者，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国海员和中国人民是不可侮的。美帝国主义对中国人民欠下的每一笔血债是一定要偿还的。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，中国海员和中国人民就一定全部、干净、彻底地消灭美国侵略者，同全世界人民一起，为最后埋葬美帝国主义作出自己的贡献。
