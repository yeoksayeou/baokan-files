Thousands of peasants from the provinces of Kim Son, Binh Tuy, and Phu Lien in South Vietnam have recently flocked into provincial capitals and county towns to hold demonstrations against the American puppet clique.

In Kim Son Province, hundreds of peasants marched into the city of Kim Son on August 19, carrying banners denouncing the atrocities committed by American B-52 bombers against innocent civilians. They protested against the persecution and slaughter of the people by American aggressors and their lackeys, and demanded the withdrawal of American invading troops from South Vietnam. Thousands of residents in Kim Son City openly expressed their support for the demonstrators.

In Binh Tuy Province, on August 18, people from the communes of Thanh An and Phu My carried the bodies of their fellow countrymen killed by the American puppet clique and wounded compatriots into the city of Binh Tuy. Together with the broad masses in the city, they angrily condemned the bloody crimes of the American aggressors.

In Phu Lien Province, on the morning of August 14, people from the commune of Tan Phu in the county of Gia Lai carried the bodies of those killed and wounded during an enemy "sweeping" operation into the county town of Gia Lai. They confronted the enemy face-to-face, and hundreds of residents in the town joined the struggle.

Editorial Note

The people of South Vietnam are achieving victories on the military, political, and economic fronts in their struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. The liberation armed forces bravely attack the enemy, smash enemy "sweeping" operations, and annihilate large numbers of American puppet troops. Peasants flock into cities under enemy control to engage in face-to-face struggles with the enemy. People in liberated areas strive to develop production and support the front lines. In 1945, Chairman Mao pointed out in "Production Can Be Carried Out in Guerrilla Zones": "War is not only a contest of military and political strength but also of economic strength." By fighting the enemy on these three fronts, the people of South Vietnam can overcome any enemy and achieve victory.

The reason why the people of South Vietnam can achieve victories on these three fronts is that they fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses, turning the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation into a genuine people's war. Chairman Mao said, "By mobilizing the entire population, a sea of people is created to drown the enemy, making up for the lack of weapons and other deficiencies, and laying the foundation for overcoming all difficulties in war." The power of people's war is boundless, and this is the reason.

    在敌占区加强反对美伪集团的斗争
    南越农民涌进城市抗暴示威
    新华社河内十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方金瓯、槟椥、薄寮等省数以千计的农民最近纷纷涌进省会和县城，举行反对美伪集团的示威游行。
    金瓯省数百名农民，八月十九日，高举控诉美国B—52型强盗飞机屠杀无辜居民罪行的横幅，涌进金瓯市举行游行示威，抗议美国强盗及其走狗迫害和屠杀人民，并且要求美国侵略军从越南南方滚出去。金瓯市成千居民，也公开表示支持示威群众。
    槟椥省清安、福美中两乡人民八月十八日抬着被美伪集团杀害的死难同胞的尸体和伤员，涌进槟椥市，同市区里的广大人民一起，愤怒谴责美国侵略强盗的血腥罪行。
  薄寮省稼来县西丰盛乡的人民，在八月十四日清晨抬着在美伪集团进行“扫荡”时被打死打伤的人到稼来县城，向敌人进行面对面的斗争，这个市镇里成百名居民也参加了斗争。
    编后
    越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争，在军事、政治、经济三条战线上，不断取得胜利。解放武装力量英勇袭击敌人，粉碎敌人“扫荡”，歼灭了大量美伪军。农民群众涌进敌伪统治下的省城县城，同敌人展开面对面的斗争。解放区人民努力发展生产，支援前线。毛主席一九四五年在《游击区也能够进行生产》一文中指出：“战争不但是军事的和政治的竞赛，还是经济的竞赛。”越南南方人民在这三条战线上和敌人进行坚决的斗争，就能压倒任何敌人，就能战胜任何敌人。
    越南南方人民之所以能够在三条战线上不断取得胜利，最根本的一条就是充分动员群众，依靠群众，使抗美救国斗争成为一场真正的人民战争。毛主席说，“动员了全国的老百姓，就造成了陷敌于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海，造成了弥补武器等等缺陷的补救条件，造成了克服一切战争困难的前提。”人民战争的威力无穷，道理也就在这里。
