A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, and active. They should regard the interests of the revolution as their first priority and subordinate personal interests to the interests of the revolution; ... They should care more about the Party and the masses than about themselves, and care more about others than about themselves. Only then can one be considered a Communist Party member.

    毛主席语录
    一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；……关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。
