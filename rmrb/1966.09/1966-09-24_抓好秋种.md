Currently, it is the peak season for autumn harvest and sowing. While focusing on the autumn harvest, rural cadres must also prioritize autumn sowing.

The requirements for this autumn's sowing are: sow more and sow well. In all feasible areas, efforts should be made to expand the area for autumn sowing, while also making every effort to improve the quality of autumn sowing.

Focusing on autumn sowing is crucial for achieving summer production increases next year and striving for a bumper harvest throughout the year. This is a glorious task for the members of the people's communes and rural cadres to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, to grasp both revolution and production, and to ensure victory in both revolution and production.

Currently, the rural areas are in a great situation. Under the impetus of the socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has significantly improved, and their enthusiasm for production has reached an unprecedented level. The material foundation of agricultural production has also been further strengthened, and the soil moisture conditions in most areas are relatively good. All these factors create favorable conditions for doing a good job in this autumn's sowing.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only by grasping things tightly and without letting up can we grasp them. If we grasp them loosely, it is as if we are not grasping them at all." The three autumn tasks are highly seasonal and must be grasped tightly and well without missing the opportunity, persisting until the end. Leaders of rural work, especially leaders at the county level and below, must quickly establish a production leadership team, emphasize politics, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, address active thoughts, and strengthen specific leadership. They must properly arrange the layout of winter grain and oil crops and green manure crops, organize labor and animal power, and other forces, identify problems, and solve them in a timely manner to ensure the autumn sowing work is done well.

    抓好秋种
    目前正是秋收秋种大忙季节，农村工作同志在抓好秋收的同时，必须抓好秋种。
    今年秋种的要求是：种多种好。在一切有条件的地方，要尽可能扩大一些秋种的面积，同时要尽最大努力提高秋种的质量。
  抓好秋种，是关系到夺取明年夏季增产和争取明年全年丰收的一件大事。这是人民公社社员和农村干部响应毛主席的伟大号召，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，保证革命和生产双胜利的光荣任务。
    当前农村是一派大好形势。在社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，广大农民群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高，生产积极性空前高涨。农业生产的物质基础也有了进一步增强，大部地区的土壤墒情比较好。所有这些，都为搞好今年秋种创造了有利的条件。
    毛主席教导我们：“什么东西只有抓得很紧，毫不放松，才能抓住。抓而不紧，等于不抓。”三秋工作，季节性很强，必须不失时机地抓紧抓好，一抓到底。领导农村工作的同志，特别是县级以下的各级领导同志，要迅速健全生产领导班子，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，抓好活思想，加强具体领导。要妥善安排越冬粮油作物和绿肥作物的布局，组织好劳力畜力和各方面的力量，发现问题，及时解决，把秋种工作搞好。
