An official of the Ceylon Journalists' Association on September 15th issued a written statement to a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, saying that the Ceylon Journalists' Association warmly hails the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China and wishes it complete victory. The written statement said, the Ceylon Journalists' Association warmly congratulates the Chinese people on their great struggle against bourgeois ideology.

The statement pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is guided by the great, great thought of Mao Zedong and led by the wise Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese people understand that without this cultural revolution, it would be impossible to eradicate the roots of capitalist restoration. The statement pointed out that to build a society that is free from imperialist rule and exploitation in all respects, a revolution in thought is as important as political and economic revolutions.

The statement strongly condemns the distorted propaganda by reactionaries and revisionists against China's Cultural Revolution, and points out that China's Cultural Revolution undoubtedly makes imperialists and the bourgeoisie mourn the destruction of the reactionary stronghold that breeds revisionist germs.
