The Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists Association, Chahada, today issued a statement strongly condemning the brutal attacks by the fascist military regime in Indonesia on overseas Chinese. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association and all upright Asian-African journalists strongly condemn the fascist military regime in Indonesia for sending thugs to brutally attack overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

Following the continuous brutal attacks and massacres of overseas Chinese in places like Makassar, Medan, and many other parts of Indonesia, the Indonesian authorities are now persecuting school principals of overseas Chinese in West Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan. In North Sumatra, thousands of overseas Chinese who wish to return to China are being subjected to unimaginable torture.

The fascist military regime in Indonesia claims to uphold the Ten Principles of Bandung, yet it commits these barbaric crimes and carries out large-scale persecution and massacres of patriotic and progressive Indonesian people and journalists. This only exposes their true nature as anti-people, anti-democratic racists, blood-stained fascists, and lackeys and tools of U.S. and British imperialism.

The Asian-African journalists, together with the anti-imperialist people of Asia and Africa, have been closely watching these crimes of the Indonesian fascists with great indignation.

The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association demands that the fascist leaders in Indonesia immediately stop persecuting and brutally attacking overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

The Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists Association, Chahada, today issued a statement strongly condemning the fascist military regime in Indonesia for illegally arresting and detaining members of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation to Indonesia. The statement said that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association, in accordance with the spirit of the Jakarta Declaration, which strongly opposes all forms of imperialism, colonialism, and fascism, including the suppression of democratic rights, fully supports the urgent appeal issued by the Central Committee of the Malayan National Liberation League on August 15, 1966, and strongly condemns the fascist military regime in Indonesia for illegally arresting, detaining, and torturing four members of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation to Indonesia since November 18, 1965.

The statement said that the appeal by the Central Committee of the Malayan National Liberation League mentioned the possibility of handing over the four Malayan freedom fighters to the "Malaysian" authorities. To hand over Malayan patriots to the neo-colonialist authorities of "Malaysia," which the Indonesian military authorities have openly mentioned, is a most despicable fascist act, contrary to the humanitarian principles upheld by the anti-imperialist and patriotic people of Indonesia, and will certainly be strongly condemned by the people of the world, especially the Asian and African people and journalists who have always opposed imperialism, colonialism, and fascism.

The statement said that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association demands the immediate release of the four detainees and the freedom to leave Indonesia and go to any country of their choice. All illegally seized property must be directly returned to them.

    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处和所有正直的亚非新闻工作者强烈谴责印度尼西亚法西斯军事当局派暴徒残暴袭击在印度尼西亚的华侨。
    继望加锡、棉兰和印度尼西亚其他许多地方的华侨不断遭受残暴袭击和屠杀之后，印度尼西亚当局现在又在迫害西爪哇、苏门答腊、加里曼丹等地的华侨学校校长；在北苏门答腊，成千名要回中国的华侨遭到无法形容的折磨。
    印度尼西亚法西斯军事当局一面声称大力维护万隆十项原则，一面却犯下了这些野蛮罪行，并大规模迫害和屠杀爱国的进步印度尼西亚人民和新闻工作者，这些只能暴露他们的本质是反人民、反民主的种族主义者，沾满鲜血的法西斯分子，美英帝国主义的走狗和工具。
    亚非新闻工作者同战斗反帝的亚非人民一道一直以极大的愤慨密切注视着印度尼西亚法西斯分子的这些罪行。
    亚非新闻工作者协会书记处要求印度尼西亚法西斯头目立即停止迫害和停止残暴袭击在印度尼西亚的华侨。

    新华社十二日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多今天发表声明，强烈谴责印度尼西亚法西斯军事当局非法逮捕和扣留马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团成员的暴行。声明说，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处根据强烈反对形形色色的帝国主义、殖民主义和法西斯主义包括反对镇压民主权利的雅加达宣言精神，完全支持一九六六年八月十五日马来亚民族解放同盟中央委员会发表的紧急呼吁，并强烈谴责印度尼西亚法西斯军事当局自一九六五年十一月十八日以来非法逮捕、扣留和虐待马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团的四名成员。
    声明说，马来亚民族解放同盟中央委员会的呼吁书提到，有可能把四位马来亚自由战士交给“马来西亚”当局。要把马来亚爱国者交给“马来西亚”新殖民主义当局，印度尼西亚军事当局的官员也公开提到过这件事，这是极其恶劣的法西斯行为，与反帝爱国的印度尼西亚人民大力维护的人道主义原则相违背的，一定会遭到全世界人民特别是一贯反对帝国主义、殖民主义和法西斯主义的亚非人民和新闻工作者的强烈谴责。
    声明说，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处要求立即释放四位被扣留者，并给予他们离开印度尼西亚、根据自己选择去任何国家的自由，所有非法抢去的财产必须直接归还给他们。
