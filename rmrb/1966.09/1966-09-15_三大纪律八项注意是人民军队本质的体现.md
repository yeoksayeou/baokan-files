The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention are determined by the essence of the people's army serving the people wholeheartedly. They fully reflect the essence of the people's army serving the people. I remember at the beginning of last year, on the day I arrived at our company, after putting down my backpack, several old platoon leaders warmly gathered around us new soldiers and took us to the honor room. Under the bright red banner of the "Model Company for Discipline and Love for the People," they introduced us to the company's glorious traditions and told us many vivid stories of the predecessors and old comrades in the company who strictly followed the rules and loved the people. We listened eagerly, but our understanding was still shallow. Soon, one time after returning from a tactical exercise, we passed through a peanut field. The old comrades all walked around in a big circle along the edge of the field, but I thought the detour was too big, so I cut a shortcut across the ridge and stepped on a peanut plant without a second thought. At that time, my comrades in the platoon all criticized me for violating the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. Platoon Leader Wu Shian jumped down to the ground and carefully straightened the peanut plant I had stepped on, covered it with soil, and filled in the footprints on the ridge. At that time, I still thought it was making a big deal out of nothing. Later, the platoon leader and I studied together the "Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" and Chairman Mao's teachings on the people's army "standing firmly with the Chinese people, serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly, this is the sole purpose of this army." This made me understand that we are the children of the people, we come from the people, we join the army for the benefit of the people, and we fight for the benefit of the people. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention are determined by the essence of our people's army serving the people wholeheartedly. Caring for, protecting, and safeguarding the interests of the people is the duty of our children of the people. No one has any reason or right to harm the interests of the people. From then on, my understanding improved, and I voluntarily put the interests of the people above everything else. In outdoor training, although we often crawl and roll around in the fields and edges, chasing and attacking, I have never damaged a single green shoot of the people.

	Zhū Fúmíng (Platoon Leader):

	In our village, the main road runs through it. My grandmother told me that before liberation, many armies passed through, including Japanese bandits, the Kuomintang's "disaster army," and the bandit troops of the landlords in western Hunan. These soldiers burned, killed, and looted, committing all sorts of evil deeds. Every time an army passed, every household was like it had been swept away by a great flood, and they couldn't even cook. However, when a Red Army led by Comrade He Long came through our village, the situation was completely different. The Red Army stayed in our village for half the night, and the next morning when the villagers opened their doors, they found that the army had camped there. It turned out that they had entered the village in the middle of the night to avoid disturbing the people, so they slept under the stone benches, in the corners of the walls, and under the eaves. Later, the guerrilla troops that were stationed there, as well as the Liberation Army, were just like the Red Army. At that time, as soon as we heard the song "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," we knew that our own troops had come. Men, women, old, and young would all hurriedly prepare food, straw mats, and tea water, and bring out all kinds of gifts to welcome our own children of the people, and they were very affectionate. After joining the army, I was assigned to the "Model Company for Discipline and Love for the People," and I felt very honored. Through repeated study of Chairman Mao's works and traditional education, and seeing many old comrades' model actions with my own eyes, my awareness of strictly following the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention has been further enhanced. When I led the troops for training outside, I treated the protection of the people's every blade of grass and tree as a political task. Once, during a shooting exercise, due to the terrain limitations, the target board was buried in a sugarcane field. During our training, we did not damage a single sugarcane. Afterwards, I repeatedly checked and loosened the footprints. In June of this year, a production team near our garrison was surrounded by a massive flood, and the lives and property of the community members were seriously threatened. I led the entire platoon, despite being ill, into the village and carried out several elderly and sick people one by one. At a community meeting comparing two types of armies during two types of disasters, many poor old men sighed: the reactionary bandit army took advantage of the disaster to commit robbery and plunder, while the people's army bravely rescued others and selflessly helped others. It was truly a world of difference. I deeply realized that the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention are the fundamental distinguishing marks of the two types of armies. The reactionary army protects the interests of the exploiting class and harms the interests of the people; our people's army protects the interests of the people and is the servant of the people. Only the people's own army can thoroughly implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and only the army that truly implements the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention has the qualification to be the children of the people.

### 三大纪律八项注意是人民军队本质的体现

    三大纪律八项注意是人民军队本质的体现
    罗利尊（文书、五好战士）：
    三大纪律八项注意是人民军队全心全意为人民服务的本质所决定的，它充分体现了人民军队为人民的本质。记得前年初，我刚到我们连队那天，放下背包，几个老班长就亲热地围拢来，把我们一群新战士带到荣誉室，在那面红光闪闪的“遵纪爱民模范连”的大锦旗下面，给我们介绍了连队的光荣传统，讲述了连里前辈们和老同志的许多遵纪爱民的生动故事，听得很上瘾，但是理解还不深。不久，有一次作战术科目回来经过一块花生地的时候，老同志都绕着个大圈沿田埂走，我嫌那弯子太大，便切了个半径从垄上几步窜了过去，踩倒了一蔸花生也不管，这时班里同志都批评我这是踏了三大纪律八项注意，班长吴世安跳下地去心疼地把我踩倒的花生苗扶正，培上土，填平了垄上的脚坑。当时，我还认为这是小题大作。事后，班长和我一起学习了《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》和毛主席关于人民军队“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨”的教导，使我懂得了我们是人民的子弟兵，我们来自人民，是为人民的利益来当兵，为人民的利益而打仗。三大纪律八项注意是我们人民军队全心全意为人民服务的本质所决定的，关心、维护和保卫人民群众的利益是我们子弟兵的天职，任何人都没有任何理由和权利来损害人民的利益。从这以后，我的认识提高了，就自觉地把人民群众的利益看得高于一切，在野外训练中，尽管经常在田头、地边摸爬滚打，追击冲杀，再没有损坏过人民群众的一棵青苗。
    朱福明（排长）：
    我们村当中是大路，听奶奶讲，解放前路过好多的军队，有日本强盗，有蒋匪帮的“遭殃军”，有湘西地主土匪兵，这些兵烧杀抢劫，无恶不作。过一次兵，各家各户就像被大水冲洗过一样，开不得锅。可是，当年贺龙同志所率领的一支红军来的时候，情况就完全不一样了。红军在我们村子里住了大半夜，第二天清早开门时村里人才知道扎了军队，原来他们深更半夜进村时怕打扰群众，就露宿在石墩、墙角、屋檐下。以后驻扎的游击队、解放军和红军一模一样。那时节，一听到《三大纪律八项注意》的歌声，就知道是自己的队伍来了。男女老少就都急天忙地准备粮食、铺草和茶水，拿出各种各样的慰劳品，欢迎自己的子弟兵，亲热得了不得。我入伍后分到“遵纪爱民模范连”里，自己感到很光荣，经过反复学习毛主席著作和传统教育，又亲眼看到许多老同志的模范行动，使我更加提高了遵守三大纪律八项注意的自觉性。我带领部队在外面训练时，把爱护群众一草一木，当作政治任务来抓。有一次射击，由于地形限制，靶板埋在一块甘蔗地里，我们训练时，不去损坏一根甘蔗，事后我还一遍一遍地反复检查，把踩的脚印都锄松了。今年六月，驻地附近一个生产队被特大的山洪包围，社员群众的生命财产受到严重威胁，我带病领着全排冲进村去，将几十个老人病人，一个个背了出来。在一次两种灾年两种军队的回忆对比的社员大会上，许多贫农老大爷感慨地说：反动匪军乘灾荒之机，行凶抢劫，人民军队见义勇为，舍己为人，真是一个天上，一个地下。我深刻地认识到：三大纪律八项注意是区别两种军队的根本标志，反动军队保护剥削阶级利益，侵害人民利益；我们人民军队保护人民利益，是人民的勤务员。只有人民自己的队伍才会彻底实行三大纪律八项注意，也只有真正执行三大纪律八项注意的军队才有资格当人民的子弟兵。　（据新华社广州十四日电）
