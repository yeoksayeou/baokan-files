The textile and dyeing workshop of the Sana'a Textile Mill, built with the aid of China, successfully began trial production on September 20.

Yemeni workers were overjoyed to see the white cotton cloth they had woven themselves. They enthusiastically cheered, "Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live Chairman Mao!" They warmly celebrated this new achievement symbolizing the development of Sino-Yemeni friendship and expressed their heartfelt gratitude and respect to Mao Zedong, the great leader beloved by the Chinese and world peoples.

The workshop director, Abdulah, excitedly told a reporter, "Today is my second birth. I am very happy. This is a great joy for the Yemeni people, a happiness for the Yemeni people. Chairman Mao leads 700 million Chinese people to create miracles and is now leading the world's people to victory."

A construction worker who built the textile mill said, "Great, very good. Chinese experts helped us produce cotton cloth on Yemeni soil using Yemeni cotton. In the future, we won't have to buy cotton cloth from imperialists."

To help the aided country develop an independent national economy, our foreign aid personnel have selflessly taught their technology to the people of the host country.

    中国也门人民友谊的结晶
    由中国援助修建的萨那纺织印染厂纺织车间九月二十日试生产成功了。
    也门职工亲眼看到自己织出的洁白棉布时，都高兴得手舞足蹈，热情欢呼“中华人民共和国万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”热烈祝贺这个象征中也人民友谊发展的新成就，并对中国和世界人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东主席表示衷心的感谢和敬意。
    这个车间的主任阿卜杜拉激动地对记者说：“今天是我第二次诞生。我非常高兴。这是也门人民的大喜事，是也门人民的幸福。毛主席领导七亿中国人民创造奇迹，现在正领导世界人民取得胜利。”
    一位建设纺织厂的建筑工人说：“好，非常好，中国专家帮助我们在也门土地上、用也门的棉花生产出来棉布，将来就可以不买帝国主义的棉布了。”（附图片）
    为了帮助受援国家发展独立的民族经济，我国援外人员毫无保留地把自己的技术教给所在国人民。图为在我国援建的也门第一个棉纺织印染厂工作的中国专家，耐心地教也门工人安装机器。　新华社稿
