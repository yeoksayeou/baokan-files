The Sato government of Japan, disregarding the opposition of the broad masses of Japanese youth, has brazenly decided to refuse to issue passports to Japanese youths participating in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. This is another blatant exposure of the Sato government's ugly face of following the U.S. imperialists and opposing the Chinese people. The Chinese people and youth strongly protest against this.

For a long time, the Sato government has followed the U.S. imperialists, engaged in anti-China activities, and used every means to sabotage the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. However, despite the Sato government's efforts, today in Japan, the call for Sino-Japanese friendship is growing louder, and more and more people are demanding to come to China. The Sato government, exhausted and desperate, has resorted to refusing to issue passports to prevent Japanese youth from participating in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival and sabotage the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. This only shows how desperate and weak they are in the face of the tide of Sino-Japanese friendship!

In this incident, the Soviet modern revisionists and their various followers have played a very unseemly role. They are in cahoots with the U.S. imperialists and the Japanese reactionaries, opposing and sabotaging the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and fiercely opposing the Sino-Japanese youth festival. The Sato government's unreasonable decision is actually a joint anti-China action by the U.S. imperialists, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Soviet modern revisionists and their various followers.

Chairman Mao has said: "It is impossible to persuade imperialists and Chinese reactionaries to change their minds and return to the right path. The only way is to organize forces to struggle against them." This also applies to the Sato government. The Sato government's unreasonable decision to sabotage the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival can only arouse strong opposition and more resolute struggle from the Japanese people and youth. The Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world firmly stand on the side of the Japanese youth and people, supporting their just struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries.

Whatever the enemy opposes, we support. The Chinese youth and people are determined to continuously strengthen the combat friendship between the youth and people of the two countries in the struggle against U.S. imperialism. We have completed all the preparations for the festival and are ready at any time to welcome Japanese friends to China to participate in the festival. Whenever you come, we will welcome you. The more you come, the more we welcome you. The evil hand of the Sato government absolutely cannot block the tide of Sino-Japanese friendship.

    佐藤政府的黑手阻挡不住中日人民友好的洪流
    本报评论员
    日本佐藤政府不顾广大日本青年的反对，悍然决定拒绝发给参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢的日本青年护照。这是佐藤政府追随美帝国主义、敌视中国人民的丑恶面目的又一次大暴露。中国人民和青年对此提出坚决抗议。
    长期来，佐藤政府追随美帝国主义，大肆反华，千方百计破坏中日人民的友好关系。但是尽管佐藤政府这样卖力气，今天在日本，要求日中友好的正义呼声越来越高，要求到中国来的人越来越多。佐藤政府智穷力竭，悍然以不发护照来阻止日本青年参加中日青年友好大联欢，破坏中日人民的友好关系。这只能说明他们在中日人民友好的洪流面前，是何等的丧魂落魄，何等的虚弱！
    苏联现代修正主义和它的形形色色的追随者，在这一事件中，扮演了极不光采的角色。他们同美帝国主义和日本反动派一鼻孔出气，敌视和破坏中日人民的友好合作，不顾一切地反对中日青年的大联欢。佐藤政府的无理决定，实际上是美帝国主义、日本反动派和苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色追随者的一次反华的“联合行动”。
    毛主席说过：“希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争”。对佐藤政府也应该这样。佐藤政府破坏中日青年友好大联欢的无理决定，只能激起日本人民和青年强烈的反对和更坚决的斗争。中国人民和全世界革命人民坚决站在日本青年和人民一边，支持他们反对美帝国主义和日本反动派的正义斗争。
    凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护。中国青年和人民决心不断加强中日两国青年和人民在反对美帝国主义斗争中结成的战斗友谊。我们已经做好大联欢的一切筹备工作，随时准备欢迎日本的青年朋友来华参加大联欢。你们什么时候来，我们就什么时候欢迎。你们来多少，我们欢迎多少。佐藤政府的罪恶的黑手绝对阻挡不住中日两国人民友好的洪流。
