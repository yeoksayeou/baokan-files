We have just returned from a visit to the border regions.

What is the most attractive thing in the border regions? The majestic snow-capped mountains, the fertile grasslands, the vast Ili River—all these attract us. However, what attracts and inspires us the most is the soldiers who have taken root in the border regions under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They are being tempered and growing rapidly in this great school of Mao Zedong Thought in the border troops. "We are the successors of Mao Zedong Thought!"

"Revolutionary soldiers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most!" "We are the successors of Mao Zedong Thought!" Throughout the journey of thousands of miles in the border regions, wherever we see the shining red badges and red caps, we hear such heroic words!

One afternoon, under the scorching sun, we visited their vegetable fields with the guidance of Comrade Wang Changli, the squad leader of the vegetable squad. More than five years ago, he came from the city to the vast desert and was assigned to work in the farm. Initially, he was in the subsidiary team, feeding chickens and herding sheep. From an ordinary middle school student, he gradually became a skilled shepherd who could assist in lambing and recognize hundreds of grasses on the desert. He learned to serve the people on the desert. Later, he was transferred to the vegetable squad and engaged in a continuous struggle against saline-alkali land and drought. When we visited, it was the peak of the drought season, but the growth of their eggplants and cucumbers was excellent. To ensure that the snow water from the mountains is first supplied to the production teams of the commune, the soldiers relied on their own strength to dig large wells beside the fields, providing a continuous water supply for irrigation.

If you ask how Wang Changli learned all this, he said: "Initially, I was not very willing to herd sheep on the desert. It was only through the struggle that I gradually armed myself with Mao Zedong Thought and decided to temper myself in this great school of the People's Liberation Army. Now I can herd sheep, grow vegetables, and my revolutionary will is even stronger. All this is the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought."

Another comrade we met was Zhao Xingbi, the squad leader of the guard squad. Five years ago, he came from his hometown in Sichuan to the vast desert. He was not used to eating "steamed buns." The dry climate was also not suitable for him. He was a person who liked to read novels. When he came to the desert, the first thing the leadership mobilized and urged him to do was to study Chairman Mao's works. Zhao Xingbi's first article to study was "The Orientation of the Youth Movement." He was shocked: "To judge whether a youth is revolutionary, there is only one standard, 'that is, whether he is willing and able to unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants.' At that time, the leadership assigned him to feed pigs. Is feeding pigs dirty? Smelly? Without prospects? Is succeeding to feed pigs? He thought about all these things. However, Chairman Mao's teachings were in his ears. A youth who is willing and able to unite with workers and peasants must be willing and able to participate in labor. By comparing his thoughts with Chairman Mao's teachings, he felt that what was dirty and smelly was not the work of feeding pigs, but his own thoughts. 'Once the ideological struggle is won, the mood becomes cheerful.' This is his true reflection. After feeding pigs, the leadership assigned him to herd sheep and horses. He not only learned to eat steamed buns but also adapted to the dry climate of the desert. He seriously told us: "Melon vines cannot grow without water, and soldiers cannot grow without Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, I had a lot of confused ideas about succession. Now I understand that in this great school of the People's Liberation Army, our common task is to carry on the banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

The soldiers in the border regions have a common wish: to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. And in the eyes of the soldiers, the harsh environment of the border regions is precisely a good classroom for learning Mao Zedong Thought.

In a station, Comrade An Jingsen shared his experiences with us. This high school student from Henan put on his military uniform for the first time, thinking of countless heroic deeds waiting for him to create. But he did not expect to be assigned to the border regions to be a soldier who carries a broom. Sweeping stones on the road, what knowledge is there? However, the political instructor solemnly told every new soldier in the company: "Only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we hold the broom for the revolution!" In the early days of holding the broom, An Jingsen always felt that dozens of eyes were watching him, and the bamboo broom was only that heavy, but it pressed his head down. At this time, the political instructor organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us, "Choose the heaviest burden to carry, endure hardships in front of others, and enjoy after others. Such comrades are good comrades." An Jingsen, once he studied Chairman Mao's works, his mind was like a battlefield. He thought that when he enlisted, he thought he could learn more knowledge and skills in this great school of the People's Liberation Army. Now he saw, compared, and thought, his original thoughts were too mediocre. To take root, bloom, and bear fruit in harsh places, it does not depend on soil or water, but on Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, An Jingsen took his first solid step. Extreme heat, severe cold, and dry climate all became good opportunities for him to temper his revolutionary will and train his body. To prevent the canal he guarded from leaking water during rain, he had to pour asphalt into the gaps of the concrete blocks. He heard that the oil-boiling team was the hardest and most tiring, so he voluntarily requested to go. When boiling oil, the oil smoke made people cry, and the hot oil dropped on the body forming blisters, but these were not a problem. Now he is already a member of the Communist Party.

"In harsh places, taking root, blooming, and bearing fruit all depend on Mao Zedong Thought." Young military doctor Jiao Zhixue also said this. Half a year ago, when he was transferred to the border regions from a large hospital, he wrote a poem facing the vast desert: "The desert is vast and desolate, the wind and sand howl, and the yellow dust rolls..." Half a year later, he changed his original poem and wrote a new one: "The desert is a good land, vast and flat, everywhere Qu Yuan moves the mountains, and the revolutionary cause is boundless!" How did this change happen?

As soon as he arrived at the desert, he was moved by the heroic spirit of the old comrades in the army who were not afraid of the sky, not afraid of the earth, not afraid of hardships, and not afraid of difficulties! Look, now the vast desert is not covered with barracks, planted with dense forests, and even built with fountains? His original thoughts of fearing hardships and difficulties, compared with theirs, had a huge gap! It was under this mood that he re-studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other articles. He said: "Chairman Mao's few articles, I don't know how many times I have read, but the 'practice' field was not big before, and I rarely put my own thoughts into it. Now, comparing my thoughts with Chairman Mao's teachings, I really sweated a lot. In the past, fearing this and that, it all came down to fearing hardships and death. If one has the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, fearing neither hardships nor death, then there is nothing to fear in the world. What is there to fear about the dryness and hot wind of the desert?"

Jiao Zhixue thus resolutely worked and struggled on the desert. He patrols every day, even on holidays and rest days. He also enthusiastically participates in physical labor. When building houses, he mixed mud, laid foundations, made bricks, and carried soil, doing everything first. The sandstorm was strong, and the sand hit his face like needles, but he insisted on carrying heavy loads against the wind. In the intense labor, he could not suppress his excitement and wrote another poem:

Under the scorching sun, what is there to fear?
The wind and sand press, what is there to worry about!
Studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" strengthens the will,
With all my heart, I am busy for the revolution.

Chairman Mao, the reddest sun in our hearts

We visited the border regions during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the company's wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and evening performances, we saw poems expressing boundless love for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao everywhere. In many meetings, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers used Mao Zedong Thought as the most sharp weapon to criticize all ghosts and snakes.

Meteorological observer Li Lanjun, who fights on the desert, recorded her experiences in her notes. These heartfelt words full of boundless love for Chairman Mao deeply moved us. Please read the following passages:

Actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is the most important thing in a communist's life. Mao Zedong Thought will forever be the red sun in my heart.

The more the bourgeois "authorities" vigorously oppose our learning of Chairman Mao's works, the more we must strive to learn, making every corner of our brains and every cell in our bodies permeated with Mao Zedong Thought.

Today, at the denunciation meeting of anti-party elements, I could not suppress my indignation and was the first to stand up to speak. The anti-party elements are so vicious, opposing Mao Zedong Thought is opposing our lifeline. I will defend the Party Central Committee to the death! Defend Chairman Mao! Follow Chairman Mao forever and carry the revolution to the end!

Li Lanjun, this daughter of a poor peasant, suffered from the oppression of the exploiting classes in the dark old society. Her grandfather worked as a carpenter for the landlord and did not rest even on the first day of the lunar New Year. Her grandmother worked as a servant for the landlord, washing clothes under the moonlight, her hands full of blood blisters. Her mother gave birth to her and died a few months later, forced by the landlord. In her heart, she planted the seeds of class hatred from a young age. In this great school of the People's Liberation Army, she mastered Mao Zedong Thought and had a clear class standpoint, her heart was bright, and her eyes were clear. She became one of the countless brave defenders of Mao Zedong Thought!

In a study session on the experience of learning Chairman Mao's works, we also heard a moving speech by Comrade Xu Jiusheng, a second artillery soldier. When he enlisted last September, he could not read a single word. Now, in the army's experience exchange meeting, he systematically introduced his experiences of half a year of actively learning and applying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other articles to transform his worldview. The more he spoke, the more excited he became. Finally, he said: "Chairman Mao's books are books for us to do revolution. The more anti-party elements oppose, the more we must study Chairman Mao's books. No matter what problem, we actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, we can solve it. As long as there is determination, even without culture, one can learn. Follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime to do revolution. Listen to Chairman Mao's words, I am not afraid of anything!"

The comrades welcomed his speech with warm applause. This applause was like thunder, like a war drum, expressing the common voice of all cadres and soldiers in our army! The young comrades stationed in the border regions are striding forward and growing vigorously in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought. (Accompanying photo)

Soldiers love Chairman Mao's books the most

    在毛泽东思想大学校里锻炼成长
    杨毅　金为华
    我们刚从边疆访问回来。
    边疆什么东西最吸引人？巍巍的雪山，肥美的草场，滔滔的伊犁河，处处都吸引了我们。可是，最吸引人、最鼓舞我们的还是在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，扎根边疆的战士们。他们在边疆部队这个毛泽东思想大学校里受到锻炼，迅速成长着。“我们是毛泽东思想的接班人！”
      “革命战士最听毛主席的话！”“我们是毛泽东思想的接班人！”边疆万里行，在红领章、红帽徽闪耀着光辉的每一个地方，我们都能听到这样豪迈的语言！
    一天下午，我们顶着烈日，在蔬菜班班长王长力同志陪同下去看他们的菜地。五年多前，他从城市来到一望无涯的大戈壁，分配到农场工作。先是在副业队，喂过鸡，放过羊。他从一个普通的中学生，逐步锻炼成为能给羊羔接生、能识戈壁滩上百样草的过得硬的牧羊人了。他在戈壁滩上学会为人民服务。以后，他被调到蔬菜班，又和盐碱地、干旱展开了持续的斗争。我们去的时候，正是干旱袭人时节，他们种的茄子、黄瓜的长势却很好。为了把高山上的雪水首先供给公社生产队用，战士们就依靠自己的力量，在菜地旁边开出大井，源源不断地取水浇田。
    要问王长力是怎样学会这一切的？他说：“当初，自己在戈壁滩上放羊，不大安心。只是在斗争中逐渐地用毛泽东思想武装头脑，才决心在解放军这所大学校里锻炼。现在会放羊了，会种菜了，革命的意志更旺盛了，这都是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。”
    我们遇见的另一位战友，是警卫班长赵兴毕同志。五年前，他从四川家乡来到大戈壁。“窝窝头”吃不惯。干燥的天气，又不适应。他是个喜欢看小说的人。来到戈壁滩上，领导上动员、号召的头一件事却是学习毛主席著作。赵兴毕自学的第一篇文章是《青年运动的方向》。一看，大吃一惊：看一个青年是不是革命只有一个标准，“这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”这时，领导分配他去喂猪。喂猪脏吗？臭吗？没出息吗？接班，难道就接个喂猪的班吗？这些他都想到了。可是毛主席的教导就在耳边。愿意并且实行和工农相结合的青年人，就要愿意并且参加劳动。用毛主席的教导一对照，他觉得脏的、臭的不是喂猪的工作，而是自己的思想。“思想斗争一胜利，心情就舒畅。”这是他真实思想的反映。从喂猪以后，领导又先后调他去牧过羊，放过马。他不但喜欢吃窝窝头，对戈壁滩的干燥气候也习惯了。他认真地对我们说：“瓜秧没有水不行，战士没有毛泽东思想不行。对接班，我过去有一脑子糊涂观念，现在才懂得，在解放军这个大学校里，我们的共同任务，就是要接好毛泽东思想的班。”艰苦的环境是学习毛泽东思想的好课堂
    在边疆的战士们，有一个共同的愿望：就是做毛主席的好战士。而边疆艰苦的环境，在战士们看来，正是学习毛泽东思想的大好课堂。
    在一个场站里，安景森同志给我们讲开了他的体会。这位来自河南的高中学生，第一次穿上军装，真不知有多少英雄事迹在前面等着自己去创造。但想不到分配到边疆来当了一名扛扫帚的战士。扫扫道上的石子，还有什么学问吗？指导员却郑重地向每一个新到连队的战士讲：只有掌握好毛泽东思想，才能为革命握好扫把！安景森开始掌扫帚那些天，总觉得有几十双眼睛专门瞅着自己，竹扫帚只有那点重，却压得连头也抬不起来了。这时候，指导员组织大家学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们“担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。”安景森一学毛主席著作，这头脑里就摆开战场了。他入伍时想，在解放军这所大学校里一定能学到更多知识，学到技术。现在一看，一比，一想，自己原先想的太差劲了。要在艰苦的地方扎根、开花、结果，一不靠土，二不靠水，靠的就是毛泽东思想。
    在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，安景森坚实地迈出了第一步。酷热严寒，气候干燥，都成了他磨炼革命意志，锻炼身体的好机会。为了防止他守护的渠道下雨渗水，要往水泥块的缝隙处灌沥青。听说熬油组最苦最累，他自觉自愿地要求去。烧火烤油的时候，油烟子呛得人直掉泪，热油滴在身上就是一个泡，这些都不在话下。现在他已经是一个共产党员了。
      “在艰苦的地方扎根开花，全靠毛泽东思想。”青年军医焦志学同志也这样说。半年前，他从一所大医院调往边疆的时候，对着大戈壁，曾写过一首诗：“戈壁茫茫无人烟，风尘呼啸黄尘卷，……”半年之后，他改掉原来那首诗，写了一首新的：“戈壁一片好河山，一望无际平展展，遍地愚公把山移，革命前程无限远！”这是怎么变的呢？
    他一到戈壁滩，首先就被部队老同志那种不怕天、不怕地、不怕苦、不怕难的英雄气概感动了！你看，现在的茫茫戈壁上不是盖好了营房，种上了密林，还修起了喷水池吗？自己那种怕苦怕难的思想同他们一比，该有多大的差距啊！他就在这种心情下，重新学习了《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》等文章。他说：“毛主席这几篇著作，不知读过多少遍了，但是过去‘实践’的天地还不大，也很少把自己的思想摆进去。现在，把自己的思想和毛主席的教导一对照，真是出了一身汗。过去怕这怕那，归根到底都是怕苦、怕死的反映，如果有了一心一意为革命、不怕苦不怕死的精神，那么世界上任何一件事都没有什么可怕的了。戈壁滩上的干燥、热风，又有什么可怕呢？”
    焦志学同志就这样铁下心来在戈壁滩上工作、斗争了。他每天巡视，节日、假日也不停止。他还热情地参加体力劳动，盖房子的时候，他和泥，打地基，打坯，挑土，什么都抢着干。风沙大，沙子打在脸上像针扎似的，他偏要迎着风沙挑重担。在紧张的劳动中他抑制不住激动的心情，又写了一首诗：
    头顶烈日何所惧，
    风沙逼人又何妨！
    学习“毛著”长斗志，
    一心只为革命忙。毛主席，我们心中最红最红的红太阳
    我们访问边疆途中，正是无产阶级文化大革命的高潮滚滚而来的时候。在连队的墙报、黑板报和晚会上，处处看到对我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的诗篇。在许多会上，广大的指战员运用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，向一切牛鬼蛇神展开批判。
    战斗在戈壁滩上的气象员李兰君同志在笔记里，记下了她在斗争中的体会。她这些饱含着对毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情写出的心里话，深深地激动着我们。请同志们读下面的几段：
    活学活用毛主席著作是一个共产党员一生中头等重要的大事。毛泽东思想永远是我心中的红太阳。
                            ＊
    资产阶级“权威”老爷们越是起劲反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们就越要拚命地学习，要使脑海的每一个空隙、让全身的每一个细胞里都浸透毛泽东思想。
                            ＊
    今天在声讨反党分子大会上，我抑制不住满腔怒火，第一个站起来发言。反党分子心肠真是恶毒，他们反对毛泽东思想，就是反对我们的命根子。我要誓死保卫党中央！保卫毛主席！永远跟着毛主席，将革命进行到底！
    李兰君，这个贫农的女儿，在暗无天日的旧社会，她全家饱受剥削阶级的压迫。祖父给地主作木活，大年初一也不得歇一天。奶奶给地主当佣人，月亮地里洗衣服，满手搓成血泡。母亲生下她以后，几个月就被地主给逼死了。在她的心灵中从小就种下了阶级仇恨的种子。在解放军这所大学校里，掌握了毛泽东思想，有了明确的阶级观点，心又明，眼又亮，她成了千千万万勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的战斗员中的一员！
    在一次学习毛主席著作经验交流会上，我们还听过二炮手许久生同志一篇动人的发言。去年九月入伍的时候，他还不识一字。现在，他在部队的经验交流会上，系统地介绍自己半年多来活学活用《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》等文章，改造世界观的体会。他越谈越激动，最后，他说：“毛主席的书是教我们干革命的书。反党分子越反对，我们就越要抓紧学习毛主席的书。不管什么问题，我们活学活用毛主席著作，都能解决。只要有决心，没文化也能学。一辈子都跟毛主席干革命。听毛主席的话，我什么都不怕！”
    战友们用热烈的掌声欢迎他的这篇讲话。这掌声像春雷，像战鼓，说出了我军全体指战员的共同心声！驻守边疆的青年战友们，在毛泽东思想大学校里奋勇前进，茁壮成长吧！（附图片）
