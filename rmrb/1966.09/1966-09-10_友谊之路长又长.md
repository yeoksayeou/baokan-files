The Chinese workers who went to Nepal to help build the Kathmandu-Kodari highway have completed their tasks and returned to Lhasa recently, bringing with them the friendship of the Nepalese people and their admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao.

Over the past two years, these workers have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, embodying the spirit of proletarian internationalism. They have endured hardships and toiled tirelessly, blasting rocks and building bridges in the Himalayas, overcoming heat and floods. With the friendly cooperation of the Nepalese people, they have successfully completed their mission, adding a glorious chapter to the history of Sino-Nepalese friendship.

These workers departed for Nepal on August 31, two years ago, according to the relevant agreements between China and Nepal. At that time, Nepal was in the midst of a rainy season, with high mountains and steep cliffs, no roads, and raging rivers without bridges. They endured many hardships and difficulties on their journey. However, upon arriving at their destination, they prepared for only one day before starting the intense construction work.

Throughout the long construction period, the Chinese workers always kept the Nepalese people in mind, considering their difficulties as their own and their happiness as their own. During rock blasting, they raised the slogan, "Rather blast a million rocks than leave a single dangerous one," working from dawn to dusk and through the night, voluntarily taking on the dangerous tasks of clearing the site. In the most challenging sections of the bridge construction, they braved the cold and worked day and night in shifts, completing the bridge ahead of schedule. Wherever the work was most arduous and dangerous, they were often found there. When the rainy season arrived in summer and autumn, causing frequent landslides, they worked tirelessly in the pouring rain to repair the roads, ensuring the highway would open to traffic as soon as possible. In a place called Dola Khadka, where landslides were particularly severe, it was estimated by the Nepalese side and Chinese experts that it would take half a month to repair. However, these workers, with their high spirits, completed the repair work in just two days and nights. Their enthusiasm for labor is still praised by the local people.

While building the road, the Chinese workers also actively helped the Nepalese people, fostering friendship between the two countries. Over the past two years, the medical team has treated over 5,400 local people free of charge. Once, while blasting rocks, worker Yang Wanshi rescued a Nepalese child who had wandered into the danger zone, risking his own life. The local people highly praised the Chinese workers' brave actions.

Selfless aid and sincere friendship, like the Sino-Nepalese highway that crosses the Himalayas, will forever be etched in the hearts of the Nepalese people. At the farewell ceremony for the workers, Nepalese friends bid them an emotional farewell, singing and speaking passionately. They expressed that the opening of the Sino-Nepalese highway has further strengthened economic and cultural ties between the two countries and deepened the friendship between the peoples. They said, "Only imperialists and their running dogs would be unhappy about this." Some people, moved, said, "We have received immense selfless aid from the Chinese government and felt the great internationalist sentiment of the Chinese people. The Chinese are diligent and brave, all because you read Chairman Mao's books, and Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated into the hearts of everyone. Mao Zedong is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also a great leader of the world!"

### 友谊之路长又长

    友谊之路长又长
    我国派往尼泊尔帮助修筑加德满都—科达里公路的部分施工人员，在完成自己所担负的任务后，带着尼泊尔人民的友情，带着尼泊尔人民对我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，已在最近回到拉萨。
    在过去的两年中，这些施工人员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级国际主义精神，吃大苦，耐大劳，在喜马拉雅山中开石岩，架桥梁，战胜炎热和洪水，在尼泊尔人民的友好合作下，圆满完成了任务，在中尼友谊史上写下了光辉的一页。
    这些施工人员是根据中尼两国的有关协议，在两年前的八月三十一日前往尼泊尔的。那时，尼泊尔正是阴雨连绵的季节，山高岩陡没有路，河流急湍没有桥，他们在一路上经受了许多辛苦和困难。但他们赶到目的地后，只作了一天的准备工作，就开始了紧张的施工。
    在长期的施工中，我国施工人员处处为尼泊尔人民着想，把别人的困难看成是自己的困难，把别人的幸福看成是自己的幸福。在开山劈石时，他们提出“宁肯开石万方，不留一块险石”的口号，起早贪黑，披星戴月，主动担任排险任务。在最困难的桥梁施工地段，他们不顾天寒水冷，日夜轮班下水作业，提前完成了架桥任务。哪里最艰巨，哪里最危险，他们就往往出现在哪里。当夏秋季节雨水来临，塌方较多的时候，他们为了使公路早日通车，冒着倾盆大雨积极抢修。有个叫刀拉卡特的地方，塌方最严重，据尼方和我国专家组估计，要半个月才能修好，但这些施工人员在抢修中干劲冲天，只突击了两天两夜就完成了。他们高涨的劳动热情，在当地传为美谈。
    援尼施工人员在筑路的同时，还积极为尼泊尔人民做好事，增进中尼两国人民的友谊。两年来，医疗组就为当地人民无偿治病五千四百多人次。有一次正在开山炸石，工人杨万西在乱石横飞的紧急时刻，冒着生命危险，抢救出一名误入险区的尼泊尔小孩。当地人民对中国工人这种英勇的行动极为赞扬。
    无私的援助，真诚的友谊，像横穿喜马拉雅山的中尼公路一样，永远刻印在尼泊尔人民的心里。在欢送施工人员归国的大会上，尼泊尔朋友们依依惜别，有的唱歌，有的讲话，热情洋溢地表示：中尼公路的通车，进一步加强了我们两国的经济、文化联系，增进了两国人民的友谊，而只有帝国主义及其走狗才会感到很不高兴。有的人激动地说：“我们从中国政府得到巨大的无私援助，感受了中国人民伟大的国际主义感情。中国人是勤劳勇敢的，这都是由于你们读毛主席的书，毛泽东思想深入到每个人的心中。毛泽东不仅是中国人民的领袖，也是世界上一位伟大的领袖！”
