The Indian reactionary government, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, has recently brought out the long-nurtured Tibetan rebel leader Dalai Lama to engage in vicious anti-China activities.

	According to the arrangements made by the Indian government, the traitor Dalai Lama began his activities in the Indian-occupied Kashmir region's Leh City on August 26 and stayed for four days. Leh City is an important base for the Indian government to conduct military provocations against China along the Sino-Indian border. It is reported that the purpose of Dalai Lama's visit is to incite local residents to be anti-China and to "contain" China's influence.

	Previously, Indian President Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had received Dalai Lama on August 4 and 6, respectively.

	On August 5, the Indian reactionary organization "Servants of the People Society" held a "reception" for Dalai Lama in New Delhi and announced the establishment of the so-called "Indo-Tibetan Cultural Association." At this "reception," the traitor Dalai Lama, following the tune set by U.S. imperialism and the Indian reactionaries, viciously attacked China, claiming that Tibet had become a "colony." He also shamelessly praised India as the "window to the world and freedom" for Tibetans. The host of this farce was the Chief Minister of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The secretary of the "Servants of the People Society," Sewak Ram, even declared at the meeting that India and Tibet are "two countries."

	The Indian government has long used the fleeing Tibetan rebels to carry out subversive and destructive activities against China. Its despicable actions have been condemned by the just public opinion of the world. Now, in the face of increasing difficulties both domestically and internationally, it once again uses the traitor Dalai Lama to engage in anti-China activities. This fully exposes the ugly face of the Indian reactionaries who are hostile to the Chinese people.

    印度政府利用叛匪达赖大肆反华
    新华社三日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府在美帝国主义的指使下，最近又把它们长期豢养的西藏叛匪头目达赖抬出来，大肆进行反华活动。
    根据印度政府的安排，叛国分子达赖八月二十六日开始，到印占克什米尔地区的列城活动四天。列城是印度政府在中印边境地区对中国进行军事挑衅的一个重要基地。据报道，达赖此行目的，是要煽动当地居民反华，“遏制”中国的影响。
    在此以前，印度总统拉达克里希南和总理英迪拉·甘地曾分别在八月四日和六日接见了达赖。
    八月五日，印度反动社团“人民公仆社”在新德里为达赖举行“招待会”，宣布成立所谓“印藏文化协会”。在这次“招待会”上，叛国分子达赖按照美帝国主义和印度反动派定下的调子恶毒地反华，叫嚷西藏变成了“殖民地”。他还无耻地吹捧印度是西藏人“通往世界及自由之窗”。主持这场丑剧的是印度北方邦邦长。“人民公仆社”秘书赛瓦克·拉姆甚至在会上把印度和西藏称为“两个国家”。
    印度政府一直利用逃亡的西藏叛匪对中国进行颠覆和破坏活动，它的这种卑鄙行径遭到世界公正舆论的谴责。现在，它在国内外困难日益加深的情况下，又一次利用叛匪达赖进行反华，这充分暴露了印度反动派敌视中国人民的丑恶嘴脸。
