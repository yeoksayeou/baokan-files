With the opening of the 21st session of the United Nations General Assembly, the collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Vietnamese question has intensified and become more active.

On September 18, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Goldberg said that the United States is willing to "invite the Soviet Union to mediate to resolve the Vietnamese conflict through negotiations." On the same day, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko stated that the Soviet Union is "willing to cooperate with all those who care about peace and freedom for the peoples of the world."

On September 19, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk said that the Vietnamese question "may not be a formal item on the agenda," but the United States "believes that the Vietnamese question will be fully discussed." On the same day, the Soviet newspaper Pravda stated, "The Vietnamese question is not formally included in the agenda of the General Assembly, but this does not mean that the United Nations has lost the possibility of playing an active role."

On September 20, U.S. Vice President Humphrey and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko separately held talks with UN Secretary-General U Thant. The center of these talks was the Vietnamese question.

Look, the United States and the Soviet Union are singing in harmony, exchanging signals, and coordinating so closely. Their goal is to drag the Vietnamese question into the United Nations and use this session of the General Assembly to rally some people to intensify the promotion of a new "peace talks" deception.

In June of this year, the United States and the Soviet Union colluded to hatch a grand conspiracy of "bombing to force peace," which ended in a shameful failure. This plan having failed, they have changed tactics and brought out the old scheme of "stopping bombing to lure peace," spreading various deceptive arguments.

One argument is that the United States will stop bombing the North, and in South Vietnam, "both sides will reduce military activities," gradually de-escalating the war. This argument equates the aggressor with the victim, equating the invader who has entered another's territory with the people fighting to defend their homeland. This is a complete cover-up for the United States' aggression against Vietnam. The U.S. imperialists are in the eastern Pacific, and Vietnam is in the western Pacific. What right does the United States have to engage in "military activities" in Vietnam? This "military activity" is clearly aggression. "Gradual escalation" is aggression, and "gradual de-escalation" is still aggression. Whether it is "de-escalation" or "escalation," as long as there is one U.S. soldier on Vietnamese soil, the Vietnamese people will definitely fight resolutely. The core of the current Vietnamese question is not the issue of gradually de-escalating the war, but the issue of the U.S. aggressors immediately, completely, and cleanly getting out of Vietnam.

Another argument is that if someone proposes a timetable for "stopping infiltration" into South Vietnam, the United States will also propose a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam. The so-called "infiltration" is a black word used by U.S. imperialism to slander the support of the people of North Vietnam for their compatriots in the South. The Vietnamese nation is a whole. As long as the United States occupies an inch of Vietnamese land, the 31 million Vietnamese people have the right to mobilize the entire nation to drive out the invaders. The Vietnamese question is not about the withdrawal of "both sides," nor is it about drawing up a timetable. For the U.S. aggressors, they should have long since gotten out of Vietnam, and now they should get out immediately. For the Vietnamese people, as long as the U.S. aggressors are still lingering in Vietnam, there is only one option: to fight to the end. Chairman Ho Chi Minh has solemnly declared: "Even if it takes five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, we will resolutely fight to complete victory."

Yet another argument is that to end the Vietnamese war, both sides must "make sacrifices." This argument appears to be fair, but it is extremely malicious. The so-called "both sides making sacrifices" essentially means that the Vietnamese people must sacrifice their independence and sovereignty in exchange for "peace" under the U.S. bayonet. This argument is a great insult to the Vietnamese people and is something that the Vietnamese people absolutely cannot tolerate.

The essence remains the same. All the deceptive tricks of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices are aimed at using the cessation of bombing in the North as bait to make the Vietnamese people lay down their arms, to make the great victory already achieved in the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle come to a halt, and to realize the evil goal of the United States permanently occupying South Vietnam and splitting Vietnam.

When they can't win by fighting, they resort to deception; when they can't deceive, they fight again. The new "peace talks" deception that U.S. imperialism is eager to promote at this session of the United Nations General Assembly is still aimed at covering up its further expansion of the war. U.S. political figures have revealed that before the November congressional elections, the Johnson administration needs to create some "peace" deception, and after the elections, it will immediately allocate an additional $13.5 billion for the invasion of Vietnam and "announce a major plan to further escalate the ground war." What kind of medicine is U.S. imperialism selling in its gourd? Isn't it very clear?

The United States and the Soviet Union using the United Nations to promote the "peace talks" conspiracy is a step in their further collusion on the Vietnamese question and is also a step in the Soviet revisionist leadership clique further acting as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism. They think they have succeeded, but this actually reflects their desperate situation.

Everyone knows that the Vietnamese question has nothing to do with the United Nations, and the United Nations has no right to discuss the Vietnamese question. No matter who it is, and no matter in what form, to propose discussing the Vietnamese question in the United Nations is illegal and will be opposed and condemned by the Vietnamese people. All countries and peoples who truly support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the liberation cause of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will be able to see through the conspiracy of the United States and the Soviet Union to promote "peace talks" in the United Nations and will not be fooled by them.

Imperialism and all reactionaries deal with revolutionary peoples with nothing but force and deception. When they can neither fight nor deceive, that is when they are about to meet their downfall.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out during the Chinese People's Liberation War: "Military suppression and political deception are the two main tools that Chiang Kai-shek uses to maintain his reactionary rule. Now people have seen the rapid collapse of these tools." Today, the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam also relies on military suppression and political deception as the two main tools. Similarly, people have already seen the rapid collapse of these tools in Vietnam. This signifies that U.S. imperialism is at its wits' end in Vietnam and its defeat is inevitable, and it signifies that the great anti-U.S. national salvation war of the Vietnamese people is step by step approaching final victory.

### 联合国根本无权过问越南问题

    联合国根本无权过问越南问题
    随着第二十一届联合国大会的开幕，美苏在越南问题上的勾结活动，又紧张起来了，忙碌起来了。
    九月十八日，美国驻联合国大使戈德堡说，美国乐于“请苏联斡旋，以使越南冲突能够通过谈判得到解决”。同一天，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯表示，苏联“愿意同所有表示关心在世界上确立各国人民的和平与自由的人进行合作”。
    九月十九日，美国国务卿腊斯克说，越南问题“可能不属于（联合国）议程上的一个正式项目”，但美国“相信越南问题将得到充分讨论”。同一天，苏联《真理报》表示，“越南问题在形式上没有列入大会的会议日程，但是，这绝对不是表明联合国丧失了起积极作用的可能性”。
    九月二十日，美国副总统汉弗莱和苏联外交部长葛罗米柯分别同联合国秘书长吴丹举行了会谈。这些会谈，中心内容是越南问题。
    请看，美苏一唱一和，互打招呼，配合得多么紧密。它们的目的就是要把越南问题拖进联合国，利用这一届联合国大会，拉拢一些人加紧推行新的“和谈”骗局。
    今年六月，美苏串通一气，搞了个“以炸迫和”的大阴谋，结果是遭到了可耻的破产。此计不成，它们又变换花样，重新拿出“停炸诱和”的老方案，散布了种种骗人的论调。
    一种说法是：美国停止轰炸北方，在越南南方“双方降低军事活动”，使战争“逐步降级”。这种说法，是把侵略者和被侵略者等同起来，把闯进别人国土的强盗同为保卫自己家园而斗争的人民等同起来。这完全是为美国侵略越南的罪行打掩护。美帝国主义在东太平洋，越南在西太平洋，美国有什么理由到越南搞“军事活动”。这种“军事活动”，明明是侵略。“逐步升级”是侵略，“逐步降级”也还是侵略。不管是“降级”，还是“升级”，只要在越南的土地上还有一个美国兵，越南人民就一定要坚决战斗。当前越南问题的核心，根本不是战争“逐步降级”的问题，而是美国侵略者从越南立即全部、彻底、干净滚出去的问题。
    又一种说法是：如果有人提出对越南南方“停止渗透”的时间表，美国也将提出美军“从越南撤退的时间表”。所谓“渗透”，这是美帝国主义诬蔑越南北方人民支援南方同胞的一句黑话。越南民族是一个整体，只要美国侵占越南的一寸土地，三千一百万越南人民就有权全民动员起来，驱逐侵略者。越南问题，根本不是什么“双方”撤退的问题，也不是什么订出时间表的问题。对于美国侵略者来说，老早就应该从越南滚蛋，现在应该立即滚蛋。对于越南人民来说，只要美国侵略军还赖在越南，就只有打到底。胡志明主席早已庄严宣告：“即使要再战斗五年、十年、二十年甚至更长的时间，我们也要坚决战斗到完全胜利。”
    还有一种说法：要结束越南战争，双方必须“作出牺牲”。这种说法，貌似公正，骨子里恶毒得很。所谓要双方“作出牺牲”，实质上只是要越南人民牺牲自己的独立、主权，来换取在美国刺刀下的“和平”。这种说法，是对越南人民的莫大侮辱，是越南人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    万变不离其宗。美帝国主义及其帮凶们的一切骗人花招，目的无非是以停止轰炸北方为诱饵，要越南人民放下武器，使已经取得伟大胜利的抗美救国斗争半途而废，实现美国永久霸占越南南方、分裂越南的罪恶目的。
    打不赢就骗，骗不了就再打。美帝国主义急于利用这一届联合国大会推行的“和谈”新骗局，仍然是为的掩护它进一步扩大战争的烟幕。美国政界人士透露，在今年十一月国会选举之前，约翰逊政府需要搞一点“和平”欺骗，而在选举之后，它就要马上增拨一百三十五亿美元侵越经费，并将“宣布把地面战争”“进一步升级的重大计划”。美帝国主义的葫芦里卖的什么药，不是很清楚吗？
    美苏利用联合国推行“和谈”阴谋，这是它们在越南问题上进一步相互勾结的一个步骤，也是苏联修正主义领导集团进一步充当美帝国主义帮凶的一个步骤。它们一搭一档，自以为得计。其实，这恰恰反映了它们的狼狈处境。
    谁都知道，越南问题根本同联合国无关，联合国根本无权讨论越南问题。不论是谁，也不论以什么方式，在联合国提出讨论越南问题，都是非法的，必将遭到越南人民的反对和谴责。一切真正支持越南人民斗争、维护亚非拉人民解放事业的国家和人民，一定能识破美苏合谋在联合国推行“和谈”的骗局，而不会上它们的当。
    帝国主义和一切反动派对付革命人民，无非是打和骗两手。当它们打又打不赢、骗又骗不了的时候，也就是它们快要完蛋的时候了。
    毛泽东同志在中国人民解放战争时期曾经指出：“军事镇压和政治欺骗，是蒋介石维持自己反动统治的两个主要工具，现在人们已经看到这些工具的迅速破产。”今天，美帝国主义对越南的侵略，也是依靠军事镇压和政治欺骗这两个主要工具。同样地，人们也已经看到这些工具在越南的迅速破产。这标志着美帝国主义在越南走投无路、败局已定，标志着越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争正在一步一步地走向最后胜利。
