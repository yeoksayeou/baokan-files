The Chinese Acrobatic Troupe held its first performance in Rawalpindi, the temporary capital of Pakistan, on September 13th, and was warmly welcomed by the audience.

As the performance began, a radiant portrait of Chairman Mao appeared on the stage backdrop, immediately eliciting thunderous applause from the entire audience, which lasted for over ten minutes.

After the performance, Zafar, the Minister of Law and Parliamentary Affairs of Pakistan, delivered a speech. He said that the splendid performance by the Chinese artists demonstrated the tremendous achievements of the Chinese revolution in the cultural realm. The great Chinese revolution not only transformed the face of China but also had a profound impact on other countries around the world.

Many Pakistani friends expressed their warm congratulations to the Chinese performers.

A spectator named Usmani said: "This is truly the art of the people. It shows the victory of Mao Zedong Thought in the cultural sphere. I believe that all Pakistani spectators, deeply moved by Chinese art, will surely gain great spiritual encouragement, which cannot be found in the decadent art of Western countries."

A professor from the Islamic Research Institute said: The immense, invincible revolutionary spirit displayed by the Chinese artists is the result of the teachings of the great Chairman Mao Zedong.

Many people wrote in the guest book: "Long live Pak-China friendship!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

    巴基斯坦观众热烈赞扬我杂技团的精采演出
    “这真正是人民的艺术”
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第十四日电　中国杂技团十三日在巴基斯坦临时首都拉瓦尔品第举行首次演出，受到观众热烈的欢迎。
    演出开始时，光辉灿烂的毛主席像出现在舞台的天幕上，满场观众顿时掌声雷动，持续达十多分钟之久。
    演出结束后，巴基斯坦法律和议会事务部长扎法尔发表了讲话。他说，中国艺术家的精采表演，显示了中国革命在文化领域中所取得的巨大成就。伟大的中国革命不仅改变了中国的面貌，而且对世界其他国家也产生了强烈的影响。
    巴基斯坦许多朋友纷纷向中国演员们表示热烈祝贺。
    一位名叫乌斯马尼的观众说：“这真正是人民的艺术。它显示了毛泽东思想在文化领域内的胜利。我相信，所有的巴基斯坦观众在深受中国艺术感动的同时，一定也获得了巨大的精神鼓舞，而这在西方国家的颓废艺术中是找不到的。”
    伊斯兰研究院的一位教授说：中国艺术家所表现的巨大的无敌的革命精神，是伟大的毛泽东主席教导的结果。
