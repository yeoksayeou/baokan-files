Edition: 1

The People's Literature Publishing House and the Cultural Relics Publishing House have each published a pocket-sized, simplified Chinese, horizontal layout edition of "Chairman Mao's Poems" (37 poems), which will be widely distributed in bookstores across the country before and after National Day. The Cultural Relics Publishing House has also reproduced a large number of single pages of Chairman Mao's poem manuscripts, which will also be distributed nationwide before and after National Day.

Chairman Mao's poems are an important part of his brilliant works. The hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have an unlimited love for our great leader, Chairman Mao, and eagerly hope to obtain "Chairman Mao's Poems." Over the past few years, although several editions of "Chairman Mao's Poems" have been published, they are far from meeting the needs of the broad revolutionary masses, especially the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They urgently demand the publication of a pocket-sized, simplified Chinese, horizontal layout edition of "Chairman Mao's Poems" that is convenient for workers, peasants, and soldiers to carry and read. The publishing houses and printing factory workers, in order to meet the needs of the revolutionary masses, strive to publish the book before National Day. They race against time, working day and night, fully demonstrating their revolutionary spirit.

The Cultural Relics Publishing House has reproduced and published Chairman Mao's poem manuscripts. In addition to continuing to print the small-sized single pages that have already been issued, they have recently published eight new medium-sized single pages (three-fold or four-fold) suitable for hanging or posting indoors. The titles of these eight manuscripts are: "Water Melody: Swimming," "Photograph of a Goddess: Yellow Crane Tower," "Picking Mulberries: Double Ninth Festival," "Level Plains: Huichang," "Remembering Qin: Luoshan Pass," "Seven-Li: Long March," "Level Plains: Liupan Mountain," and "Seven-Word Absolute: For Comrade Li Jin's Photograph of the Lushan Immortal Cave."

    让伟大领袖的光辉诗篇更普遍地同革命群众见面
    《毛主席诗词》简体字横排袖珍本出版
    新华社二十七日讯　人民文学出版社和文物出版社分别出版的《毛主席诗词》（三十七首）简体字横排袖珍本，将于国庆节前后陆续在全国各地新华书店普遍发行。文物出版社还影印了大量的毛主席诗词手稿单页，也将在国庆节前后陆续向全国各地发行。
    毛主席诗词是毛主席光辉著作的重要组成部分。亿万革命群众无限热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席，迫切希望得到《毛主席诗词》。几年来，虽然出版了好几种版本的《毛主席诗词》，但远远不能满足广大革命群众，特别是工农兵读者的需要，他们迫切要求出版能够随身携带、便于工农兵阅读的简体字横排袖珍本《毛主席诗词》。出版社和印刷厂的革命职工为了满足革命群众的要求，争取在国庆节前出书，他们争分夺秒，日夜赶印，充分发挥了革命干劲。
    文物出版社影印出版的毛主席诗词手稿，除继续印制已经发行的小型单页以外，最近又新出了八种适于在室内悬挂或张贴的中型单页（三开或四开）。这八种手稿的题目是：《水调歌头·游泳》、《菩萨蛮·黄鹤楼》、《采桑子·重阳》、《清平乐·会昌》、《忆秦娥·娄山关》、《七律·长征》、《清平乐·六盘山》、《七绝·为李进同志题所摄庐山仙人洞照》。
