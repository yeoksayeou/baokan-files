On August 29, American imperialism once again brazenly provoked war against the Chinese people. On that day, a small Chinese cargo ship sailing on a normal route in the western waters of the Gulf of Tonkin was bombed and strafed for three hours by American bandit aircraft. One of our cargo ships was sunk, and another was damaged. Nine of our crew members were killed, and seven were injured. This is another serious war provocation by American imperialism against the Chinese people since it expanded its aggression in Vietnam. The 700 million Chinese people are filled with indignation and strongly condemn and resolutely protest the bloody crimes of American imperialism.

While expanding its aggression in Vietnam, American imperialism is madly provoking the Chinese people, which can only further galvanize the Chinese people's resolve to aid Vietnam and resist America. It is easy to shake the mountains, but it is difficult to shake the resolve of the Chinese people. No matter what American imperialism does or what tricks it plays, the Chinese people will definitely firmly support the Vietnamese people to the end, until there is not a single American soldier on Vietnamese soil, until the Vietnamese people achieve complete victory and national reunification.

The Chinese people have long seen through the wolfish ambitions of American imperialism. After bombing Hanoi and Haiphong, the Johnson administration hypocritically claimed that America's "objectives are limited" and that America does not want to "take any offensive action" against China. All of this is a smokescreen. American aircraft participating in the war against Vietnam openly bombed and strafed a Chinese cargo ship flying the Chinese flag. What kind of "limited" objective is this! Is this not a deliberate attack?! We must use the clearest language to tell the American aggressors: The Chinese people have made all the necessary preparations, and we are standing in full readiness. The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China solemnly declared: "If they dare to impose war on us, the 700 million Chinese people, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, will definitely break the backbone of the aggressors and thoroughly, completely, and entirely wipe them out."

The blood debt that the American aggressors owe the Chinese people must be repaid!

    一定要讨还这笔血债
    本报评论员
    八月二十九日，美帝国主义又一次猖狂地向中国人民进行战争挑衅。这一天，航行在北部湾西部海域正常航线上的我国小型货船，遭到美国强盗飞机长达三个小时的轰炸扫射。我国货船一艘被炸沉，一艘被炸伤。我国船员九人被打死，七人被打伤。这是美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争以来对中国人民的又一次严重的战争挑衅。七亿中国人民满腔义愤，最强烈地谴责和最坚决地抗议美帝国主义的血腥罪行。
    美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，向中国人民疯狂挑衅，只能更加激励中国人民援越抗美的决心。撼山易，撼中国人民的决心难。不管美帝国主义还要干什么，还要搞什么名堂，中国人民一定坚决支援越南人民打到底，直到越南土地上没有一个美国兵，直到越南人民获得彻底的胜利和祖国的统一。
    中国人民早就看透了美帝国主义的狼子野心。约翰逊政府在轰炸河内、海防以后，曾经假惺惺地表示，美国的“目标是有限的”，美国不想对中国“采取任何进攻性行动”。这统统是烟幕弹。参加侵越战争的美国飞机公然轰炸扫射悬挂中国国旗的我国货船，这是什么“有限”！这难道不是蓄意的进攻？！我们要用最明白的语言告诉美国侵略者：中国人民已经作好了一切准备，我们正在严阵以待。我党八届十一中全会公报郑重宣告：“如果它们胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，在毛泽东同志和中国共产党领导下的七亿中国人民，就一定要打断侵略者的脊骨，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它们消灭掉。”
    美国侵略者对中国人民欠下的这笔血债，是一定要偿还的！
