In China's first railway wheel rim factory, workers, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, seized the revolution, and promoted production. All production indicators have made remarkable progress. The factory's two main products—wheel rims and wheels—have seen good production this year. Various types of wheel rims have already exceeded the original annual production plan by the end of July; wheels are also nearing the completion of the annual production plan.

The factory's ten products not only exceed the state plan every month and quarter but also have a qualification rate of over 98% for each product. Costs have been reduced by 44% compared to the end of last year. Workers have also boldly innovated processes, producing special large and small rolled products that exceed design specifications.

    火车车轮轮箍厂夺得优质高产
    成本比去年年底降低将近一半
    据新华社十三日讯　在我国第一个火车车轮轮箍工厂里，职工们在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，各项生产都获得了突飞猛进的发展。这个厂生产的两种主要产品——轮箍和车轮，今年生产情况都很好。各种类型的轮箍，早在七月底就突破了原定的年产计划；车轮也已接近完成了年产计划。
    这个厂的十项产品不但逐季逐月超额完成国家计划，而且各项产品的合格率达到百分之九十八以上，成本比去年年底降低了百分之四十四。职工们还大胆革新工艺，生产出了超过设计水平的特大、特小轧制品。
