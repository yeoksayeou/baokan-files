Ambassador Wang Guoqian's Main Speech at the 13th Sino-American Ambassadorial Talks

I

Ambassador,

Today, I would like to first discuss the issue of relations between China and the United States.

(1) For seventeen years, the U.S. government has consistently pursued a policy of hostility and aggression towards China. This policy has been met with the strongest condemnation from the Chinese people and the people of the world, and it has completely failed. However, the U.S. government is not willing to accept its defeat and is trying every means to play a counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy to cover up its criminal acts against the Chinese people.

Recently, U.S. officials have repeatedly expressed a desire to "reconcile" with China, to "build bridges" with China, and to engage in "peaceful cooperation" with China. The U.S. government seems to think that by saying a few nice words, the Chinese people and the people of the world will be deceived. This is sheer delusion. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are neither afraid of U.S. threats nor do they believe U.S. lies. The ironclad facts of the past seventeen years, especially in recent times, have proven that the U.S. government's claim of "easing" Sino-American relations is not worth a penny.

(2) The U.S. government's military provocations and war threats against our country have never stopped and have become increasingly brazen. Since the last meeting, U.S. military aircraft and warships have repeatedly violated our airspace and territorial waters. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued 403 to 411 serious warnings to the U.S. government. At the same time, U.S. military aircraft have continued to harass and attack our merchant ships and fishing boats in international waters. On May 28, U.S. military aircraft savagely attacked our fishing boats in the public sea fishing grounds of the Gulf of Tonkin, killing and injuring twenty-one of our fishermen. On August 29, U.S. military aircraft brazenly attacked our small cargo ship on a normal route in the western part of the Gulf of Tonkin, sinking and damaging one of our cargo ships each, killing nine of our crew members and injuring seven. Our Ministry of National Defense has lodged the strongest protest against the U.S. government. The great Chinese people are not to be trifled with. The blood debt owed by the U.S. government must be settled and must be repaid. Now, I am instructed to once again issue the most serious warning and the strongest protest to you and through you to the U.S. government regarding the aforementioned military provocations by the U.S. government against our country.

The U.S. government has been using force to occupy China's Taiwan Province to this day and has further colonialized and militarized Taiwan. Not long ago, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk personally went to Taiwan to conspire with the Chiang Kai-shek gang to plot evil deeds against the Chinese people. It was at this time that the Chiang Kai-shek gang loudly clamored to "retake the mainland." The U.S. government's occupation of Taiwan Province is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk's recent conspiratorial activities in Taiwan have further aroused the extreme anger of the Chinese people. Now, I am instructed to reiterate: The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and the U.S. government must withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

The U.S. government's occupation of Taiwan is not only intolerable to the liberated Chinese people but is also absolutely intolerable to the Chinese compatriots in Taiwan who are still under U.S. occupation. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the strong desire of the Taiwanese compatriots to return to the embrace of the motherland will definitely be realized and is unstoppable. The U.S. government's attempt to use a small clique of the Chiang Kai-shek gang to obstruct the Taiwanese compatriots from realizing their wishes will definitely meet with a shameful failure.

For a long time, the U.S. government has set up military bases around China and formed military alliances. Now, it is frantically tightening its military encirclement of China. Recently, it has gathered some of its lackeys in Asia and the Pacific, including the Chiang Kai-shek gang, in Seoul to plot a new military alliance against China. Immediately after that, it colluded with the Soviet revisionist leadership and Japanese militarism to plot a new "holy alliance" against communism, the people, revolution, and China. The U.S. government's attempt to encircle China is in vain. The Chinese people who hold high the banner of anti-Americanism are forever unencircled. The one that is surrounded by the people of the world is not China, but the United States. The Chinese people have the confidence and determination to thoroughly smash any aggressive plots of the U.S. government together with the oppressed peoples and nations of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world.

The U.S. government's clamor to build a military encirclement of China is not a new trick. Didn't the Japanese militarists once loudly propagandize the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and play the trick of "Asians fighting Asians"? The U.S. government's tricks are nothing but picked up from the Japanese militarists' garbage heap. The U.S. government does this not only to oppose China but also to invade and enslave all the peoples of Asia. The Chinese people and the peoples of Asia will not fall for your tricks.

(3) The actions of the U.S. government against China have indisputably proven that the U.S. government has not the slightest sincerity in easing Sino-American relations. On the contrary, it is escalating its policy of hostility and aggression against China, shifting the focus of its global strategy to the East, and treating the Chinese people as its primary enemy.

Twenty years ago, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, made the brilliant judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. We would like to take this opportunity to warn the U.S. government: The Chinese people have faced you before, and we know exactly how powerful you are. We are already prepared. If you dare to impose war on the Chinese people, then we will see it through to the end.

Ambassador,

The affairs of the world should be managed by the people of each country, and the affairs of Asia should be managed by the Asian people, not by the United States. U.S. aggression in Asia can only arouse the broad and resolute resistance of the Asian people. If the United States comes to Asia to fulfill any "obligations," it will only end up with a bloody nose and a broken head. It is time for the U.S. government to realize this. The U.S. aggressors must get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait and get out of Asia.

II

Ambassador,

Now, I would like to comment on the issue of the U.S. government's escalation of the war in Vietnam.

(1) Disrupt, fail, disrupt again, fail again, until annihilation—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. The actions of the U.S. government in Vietnam will not deviate from this logic.

Since the last meeting, the U.S. government has brazenly expanded its bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the capital Hanoi and the important port of Haiphong, committing the most despicable and shameful war blackmail against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, pushing the war in Vietnam to a new and more serious stage. At the same time, the U.S. government has increased its troops of aggression in South Vietnam to over three hundred thousand, implementing a "scorched earth" policy of "burning, killing, and destroying" against the people of South Vietnam. Not only that, the U.S. government has also instigated the South Vietnamese puppets, the Thai reactionaries, and the right-wing forces in Laos to carry out military provocations against Cambodia and launch savage attacks on the liberated areas of Laos, attempting to spread the war throughout Indochina.

The U.S. government has done its utmost to disrupt Vietnam, but it has only met with the most shameful failure. U.S. bandit aircraft in North Vietnam have been met with a head-on counterattack by the heroic Vietnamese people. The U.S. aggressor troops in South Vietnam have been beaten to a pulp. The U.S. aggressors are the defeated soldiers of the Vietnamese people, and they have already lost in Vietnam.

Unfortunately, the U.S. government has not learned its lesson and become wiser. It is like a gambler who loses more and more and becomes more and more reckless. Various signs indicate that the U.S. government is speeding up conscription and preparing to expand its troops of aggression in Vietnam to four hundred thousand, five hundred thousand, or even seven hundred and fifty thousand. In short, it still wants to use the method of escalating the war to save its losing situation.

However, history has always been ruthless to aggressors. The more the U.S. government escalates the war, the more miserable its failure will be. Every time the U.S. government fails, it raises the level of the war; every time the U.S. government raises the level of the war, its failure also rises to that level. The U.S. government in Vietnam has fallen into a vicious cycle of no return.

(2) The reactionary ruling class maintains its rule and carries out external expansion by relying on two methods: one is the executioner-style suppression, and the other is the priest-style deception. The actions of the U.S. government in Vietnam are exactly like this.

Every time the U.S. government starts a war in Vietnam, it preaches peace. Recently, at the same time as escalating the war, the U.S. government, together with the Soviet revisionist leadership and the reactionary forces of various countries, has released a new smoke screen of "peace talks." They loudly propagandize the need to "gradually de-escalate" the war in Vietnam. They vigorously advocate solving the Vietnamese problem on the basis of the Geneva Agreement.

The heroic and tested Vietnamese people are not only undaunted but also untricked. No matter how flowery the U.S. government talks, no matter how hard the Soviet revisionist leadership tries to back you up, the Vietnamese people will not believe that a piece of paper will make American imperialism lay down its butcher's knife and become a Buddha, or become a bit more decent. They have already exposed one American peace hoax after another.

Everyone knows that whether the war in Vietnam is escalated or de-escalated, it is an aggressive war. The core of the current Vietnamese issue is not the problem of gradually de-escalating the war, but the problem of the immediate and complete withdrawal of the U.S. aggressors from South Vietnam. The U.S. government's plot of "bombing for peace" will never succeed. Everyone knows that the Geneva Agreement has long been torn to shreds by the U.S. government. Attempting to bind the hands of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world with the Geneva Agreement is absolutely impossible.

The U.S. government's peace hoax has already failed and will definitely suffer a complete failure. What the U.S. government cannot get on the battlefield, it will not be able to get on the negotiating table. The U.S. government's counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy will absolutely not deceive the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, but will only further expose its treacherous face to the world.

(3) The Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation is just, is firmly supported by the people of the world, and is definitely victorious. The iron wall of the Vietnamese people's war is unbreakable, completely unbreakable.

On July 17, President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a "Call to Arms." President Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared: "Johnson and his lackeys must understand: They can send five hundred thousand, one million, or even more troops to strengthen their aggression against South Vietnam. They can use thousands of aircraft to strengthen their bombing of North Vietnam. But they cannot shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist American aggression and save the nation. 'The war can last five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and other cities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamese people will not be intimidated! Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom.' President Ho Chi Minh's declaration, which is as grand as mountains and rivers, is the strongest response to American imperialism's war blackmail policy.

The Chinese people wholeheartedly and resolutely support President Ho Chi Minh's "Call to Arms" of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end, until not a single American soldier remains on the sacred territory of Vietnam, and achieving the final victory in the war of resistance against American aggression. The Chinese government has repeatedly solemnly declared that American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam is aggression against China. Seven hundred million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people. The vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. To support the Vietnamese people in achieving a complete victory in the war of resistance against American aggression, the Chinese people are prepared to make the greatest national sacrifices.

The Chinese people mean what they say. If you underestimate the Chinese people's firm resolve to support the Vietnamese people in fighting to the end, if you underestimate the actions the Chinese people will take for this, then you will make a serious, historical mistake, and you will regret it deeply.

    王国权大使关于中美关系和美国扩大侵越战争问题的发言
    毛泽东思想武装的中国人民不怕美国威胁不信美国谎话
    十七年来，美国政府一直对中国实行敌视政策和侵略政策，越来越肆无忌惮地进行军事挑衅和战争威胁，现在又拚命地加紧对中国的军事包围，把中国人民当作主要敌人。铁的事实证明，美国政府要“和缓”中美关系的说法一文不值。中国人民一定要解放台湾，并且决心同世界人民一道，彻底粉碎美国政府的任何侵略阴谋。
    当前越南问题的核心，决不是美帝苏修和各国反动派所谓战争逐步降级问题，而是美国侵略者立即、全部从越南南方撤出的问题。为了支持越南人民夺取抗美战争彻底胜利，中国人民准备承担最大的民族牺牲。如果你们低估中国人民的坚强决心和为此将要采取的行动，你们将后悔莫及。
    新华社华沙七日电　中华人民共和国代表王国权大使七日在第一三一次中美大使级会谈中的主要发言，全文如下：
    一
    大使先生，今天我首先要谈中国和美国的关系问题。
    （一）十七年来，美国政府一直对中国实行敌视政策和侵略政策。这种政策遭到了中国人民和世界人民最强烈的谴责，已经彻底破产。但是，美国政府还不甘心于它的失败，正在千方百计地玩弄反革命两手政策，来掩盖它同中国人民为敌的罪恶行径。
    最近，美国官员纷纷表示要同中国“和解”，要同中国“搭桥”，要同中国实行“和平合作”。美国政府以为它们讲了这么几句漂亮话，中国人民和世界人民就会被迷惑住了，这完全是痴心妄想。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，既不害怕美国的威胁，也不相信美国的谎话。十七年以来，特别是最近一个时期以来的铁的事实，证明美国政府要“和缓”中美关系的说法是一文钱也不值的。
    （二）美国政府对我国的军事挑衅和战争威胁不仅从来没有停止过，而且越来越肆无忌惮。自从上次会谈以来，美国的军用飞机和军舰又多次侵犯我国的领空和领海。我国外交部为此向美国政府提出了四百零三次到四百一十一次严重警告。与此同时，美国军用飞机又不断地在公海上骚扰和袭击我国的商船和渔船。五月二十八日，美国军用飞机疯狂地袭击了在北部湾公海渔场捕鱼的我国渔船，打死打伤我国渔民二十一人之多。八月二十九日，美国军用飞机悍然袭击了在北部湾西部正常航线上航行的我国小型货船，炸沉炸伤我国货船各一艘，打死我国船员九人，打伤我国船员七人。我国国防部为此向美国政府提出了最强烈的抗议。伟大的中国人民不是好惹的。美国政府欠下的血债，必须清算，必须偿还。现在，我奉命就美国政府对我国进行的上述军事挑衅，向你并且通过你向美国政府，再次提出最严重的警告和最强烈的抗议。
    美国政府至今使用武力霸占了中国的领土台湾省，并且使台湾进一步殖民地化和军事基地化。前不久，美国国务卿腊斯克还亲自跑到台湾同蒋介石匪帮密谋，策划对中国人民的罪恶勾当。就是在这个时候，蒋介石匪帮大肆叫嚣要“反攻大陆”。美国政府霸占中国台湾省，是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。美国国务卿腊斯克最近到台湾阴谋活动，进一步激起了中国人民的无比愤怒。现在，我奉命重申：中国人民一定要解放台湾，美国政府必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤出它的一切武装力量。
    美国政府侵占台湾，不仅解放了的中国人民不能容许，更是至今仍在美国占领下的中国台湾同胞所绝对不能容许。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，台湾同胞要求重回祖国怀抱的强烈愿望是一定要实现的，是永远也阻挡不了的。美国政府妄图利用一小撮蒋介石匪帮来阻挠台湾同胞实现他们的愿望，必定要遭到可耻的失败。
    长期以来，美国政府在中国周围遍设军事基地，拼凑军事集团。现在，它又在拚命地加紧对中国的军事包围。最近，它就把它在亚洲和太平洋地区的一些仆从，包括蒋介石匪帮在内，弄到汉城开会，妄图组织一个针对中国的新的军事同盟。紧接着，它又伙同苏联修正主义领导集团和日本军国主义策划一个反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的新神圣同盟。美国政府妄想包围中国，是枉费心机的。高举反美旗帜的中国人民是永远也包围不住的。陷入全世界人民重重包围之中的，决不是中国，而是美国。中国人民有信心和决心同亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界被压迫人民和民族一道，彻底地粉碎美国政府的任何侵略阴谋。
    美国政府叫嚷要建立对中国的军事包围，并不是什么新花招。当年日本军国主义不是大肆宣传过“大东亚共荣圈”吗？不是玩弄过“亚洲人打亚洲人”的把戏吗？美国政府的这一套只不过是从日本军国主义垃圾堆里拣来的。美国政府这样做是为了反对中国，同时也是为了侵略和奴役全亚洲人民。中国人民和亚洲人民决不会上你们的当。
    （三）美国政府对中国的所作所为，无可争辩地证明，美国政府一丝一毫也没有和缓中美关系的诚意。相反地，它却在变本加厉地执行对中国的敌视政策和侵略政策，把它的全球战略的重点东移，把中国人民当作主要敌人。
    二十年前，中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席提出了关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断。我们愿意借此机会正告美国政府，中国人民是同你们较量过的，你们究竟有多大本领，我们是很清楚的。我们已经作好了准备。如果你们胆敢把战争强加在中国人民头上，那么，我们一定奉陪到底。
    大使先生，世界各国的事务应该由各国人民自己来管，亚洲的事务应该由亚洲人民自己来管，而决不应该由美国来管。美国对亚洲的侵略只能引起亚洲人民广泛和坚决的反抗。美国要到亚洲来履行什么“义务”，只能使它自己碰得焦头烂额，头破血流。现在是美国政府意识到这一点的时候了。美国侵略者必须从台湾和台湾海峡滚出去，必须从亚洲滚出去。
    二
    大使先生，现在我想就美国政府扩大侵越战争的问题发表一点评论。
    （一）捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑。美国政府在越南的所作所为，也决不会违背这个逻辑。
    自从上次会议以来，美国政府悍然把它对越南民主共和国的轰炸，扩大到越南的首都河内和重要港口海防，对越南民主共和国进行了最卑鄙、最无耻的战争讹诈，把侵越战争推进到一个新的、更为严重的阶段。与此同时，美国政府把它在越南南方的侵略军增加到三十万人以上，对越南南方人民变本加厉地实行“烧光、杀光、毁光”的“焦土政策”。不仅如此，美国政府还唆使南越傀儡、泰国反动派和老挝右派，对柬埔寨进行军事挑衅，对老挝解放区发动猖狂进攻，妄图把战火烧遍整个印度支那。　
    美国政府在越南竭尽捣乱之能事，然而它所得到的只是、也只能是最可耻的失败。美国强盗飞机在越南北方遭到了英雄的越南人民的迎头痛击。美国侵略军队在越南南方被打得落花流水。美国侵略者是越南人民的手下败将，它在越南是已经输定了的。
    遗憾的是，美国政府并没有接受教训，变得聪明一些。它活像一个赌徒，越输越眼红，越输越要冒险。种种迹象表明，美国政府正在加速征兵，准备把它在越南的侵略军队扩充到四十万、五十万、甚至七十五万。总之，它还想用扩大战争的办法，来挽救它的败局。
    但是，历史对侵略者向来是无情的。美国政府越是扩大战争，它失败得也就越惨。美国政府每失败一次，就把战争升高一级；美国政府每把战争升高一级，它的失败也就随之升高一级。美国政府在越南陷入了一个不能自拔的恶性循环。
    （二）反动统治阶级维持自己的统治和实行对外扩张，从来是依靠两手的，一手是刽子手式的镇压，一手是牧师式的欺骗。美国政府在越南的所作所为正是这样。
    美国政府在越南每烧一把战火，就要念一次和平经。最近，与扩大战争的同时，美国政府又伙同苏联修正主义领导集团和各国反动派，放出了一股“和平谈判”的新烟雾。它们大肆宣扬要使越南战争“逐步降级”。它们极力鼓吹要在日内瓦协议的基础上解决越南问题。
    英雄的、久经考验的越南人民不仅是吓不倒，而且是骗不了的。无论美国政府说得怎样天花乱坠，无论苏联修正主义领导集团怎样卖力地为你们帮腔，越南人民决不会相信一纸条约会使美帝国主义放下屠刀，立地成佛，或者变得稍为规矩些。他们已经把美国的和谈骗局一个又一个地揭穿了。
    谁都知道，美国对越南的战争，无论是升级或降级，都是侵略战争。当前越南问题的核心，也决不是什么战争逐步降级的问题，而是美国侵略者立即、全部从越南南方撤出的问题。美国政府的“以炸迫和”阴谋，是绝对不能得逞的。谁都知道，日内瓦协议早已被美国政府撕得粉碎。企图用日内瓦协议来束缚越南人民、中国人民和全世界人民的手脚，是绝对办不到的。
    美国政府的和谈骗局已经破产，而且必定遭到彻底破产。美国政府在战场上所不能得到的东西，它就休想在谈判桌上得到。美国政府玩弄反革命的两手政策，绝对欺骗不了越南人民和世界人民，相反，只能在全世界进一步暴露它的奸险面目。
    （三）越南人民的抗美救国斗争是正义的，是得到全世界人民坚决支持的，是一定能够取得胜利的。越南人民战争的铜墙铁壁是什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。
    七月十七日，越南民主共和国胡志明主席发表了《号召书》。胡志明主席庄严宣告：“约翰逊和他的走狗必须懂得：他们可以出动五十万、一百万或者更多的军队来加强对越南南方的侵略战争。他们可以使用成千架飞机来加强对越南北方的轰炸。但是，他们绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。”“战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，河内、海防和其他一些城市、企业可能被摧毁，但是，越南人民是不会被吓倒的！没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵的了。”胡志明主席的气壮山河的宣言，是对美帝国主义的战争讹诈政策作出的最强有力的回答。
    中国人民最热烈、最坚决地支持越南民主共和国胡志明主席的《号召书》，坚决支持越南人民打到底，直到在越南的神圣领土上不剩一个美国兵，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。中国政府已经一再郑重声明，美帝国主义对越南的侵略，就是对中国的侵略。七亿中国人民，是越南人民的坚强后盾。中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。为了支持越南人民夺取抗美战争的彻底胜利，中国人民准备承担最大的民族牺牲。
    中国人民说了话是算数的。如果你们低估中国人民支持越南人民打到底的坚强决心，如果你们低估中国人民为此将要采取的行动，那么，你们将会犯下严重的、历史性的错误，你们将会后悔莫及。
