"Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Since this year, especially since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the vast numbers of workers, peasants, and commercial staff in our country have followed Chairman Mao's great directive, further emphasized politics, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, carried out the revolution, and promoted production. As a result, industrial and agricultural production has reached a new high, and the urban and rural markets across the country have presented an even more prosperous scene.

The great development of industrial and agricultural production has provided a solid material foundation for the market. In the first eight months of this year, the total value of industrial and agricultural products purchased by various departments of commerce nationwide increased by 12.5% compared to the same period last year. The total amount of goods supplied to the market increased by 10.4% compared to the same period last year. This means that on the basis of continuous growth in recent years, the purchases and supplies this year have increased significantly again.

In urban and rural markets, the sales volume of most major commodities has increased significantly. The sales volume of fertilizers, semi-mechanized agricultural tools, and pesticides used to support agricultural production has increased by more than 40% compared to the same period last year. The sales volume of essential consumer goods for people's lives, such as cotton cloth, knitted cotton fabrics, rubber shoes, plastic shoes, kerosene, salt, pork, sugar, and vegetables, has increased by 10% to 30%. To meet the needs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the supply of machine-made thin paper has increased by more than 20%.

Despite the significant increase in the supply of goods, the inventory of various departments of commerce continues to increase. Market prices remain stable, and people's lives have further improved.

The excellent situation in urban and rural markets across the country is the result of the great development of industrial and agricultural production. It is also the result of the nationwide commercial staff, following Chairman Mao's directive that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," emphasizing politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and achieving ideological transformation.

Over the past year, the vast numbers of staff in various departments of commerce across the country, with deep class feelings, have more consciously and organizedly carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They used various forms such as training classes, pre- and post-shift meetings, and sharing sessions to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." They also examined and compared their own thoughts, seriously transforming their worldviews. Through studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," many staff members examined and criticized the ideas of commercialism, positionism, employment views, and various capitalist business ideas, further establishing a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people. Revolutionary staff members proudly declared: to turn commercial enterprises into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought; to be politicians of the proletariat, not businessmen of the bourgeoisie, and to stand at the counter for the revolution for life; to be like the People's Liberation Army, turning the commercial team into a revolutionary force that wholeheartedly serves the people.

Since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary spirit of the vast numbers of commercial staff has been further inspired. They clearly recognize that the commercial sector is an important battlefield in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism. There is economic struggle here, as well as political and ideological struggle. Therefore, revolutionary staff members, in conjunction with the socialist education movement, actively participated in this unprecedented great revolutionary movement. They actively cooperated with the Red Guards in various places, thoroughly criticized the old and established the new, changing the capitalist business methods and styles that existed in some aspects, making the market scene undergo profound changes, and more prominently displaying the socialist market characteristics of serving industrial and agricultural production and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. These major reforms have been warmly welcomed and firmly supported by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The vast numbers of commercial staff armed with Mao Zedong Thought have also directed their boundless revolutionary enthusiasm into the business work of purchasing, supplying, transporting, and storing, quickly transforming spiritual strength into tremendous material strength, thus making various tasks done more, faster, better, and more economically.

The advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's works—Fangxiang Brigade in Hanzhou County, Jiangsu Province—achieved a relatively large autumn harvest. The commune members, with boundless revolutionary passion for loving Chairman Mao, performed songs and dances they composed themselves at the threshing ground, "Chairman Mao's Works Like the Sun."

    无产阶级文化大革命促进了社会生产的大革命
    工农业生产大发展为市场提供雄厚的物质基础
    全国城乡市场一片繁荣景象
    商品供应量大幅度增长，库存继续增加，物价稳定，人民生活进一步改善
    据新华社二十四日讯　“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”今年以来，特别是开展无产阶级文化大革命运动以来，我国广大工人、农民和商业职工遵照毛主席这一伟大教导，进一步突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，工农业生产出现了新高潮，全国城乡市场出现了更加繁荣的景象。
    工农业生产的大发展，为市场提供了雄厚的物质基础。今年前八个月，全国商业各部门收购的工农业产品总值比去年同期增加了百分之十二点五，供应市场的商品总额比去年同期增加了百分之十点四。这就是说，在近几年持续增长的基础上，今年的收购和供应又有了较大幅度的增长。
    在城乡市场上，绝大部分主要商品的销售量都大幅度上升。用来支援农业增产的化肥、半机械化农具和农药等产品，销售量都比去年同期增长百分之四十以上；人民生活的必需的棉布、针棉织品、胶鞋、塑料鞋、煤油、食盐、猪肉、食糖、蔬菜等消费品，销售量分别增长了百分之十到三十。适应无产阶级文化大革命的需要，机制薄纸的供应量增加了百分之二十以上。
    尽管商品供应量大幅度增长，商业各部门的库存仍然继续增加。市场物价稳定，人民生活进一步改善。
    全国城乡市场这种大好形势，是工农业生产大发展的结果，是全国广大商业职工根据毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的指示，大力突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化的结果。
    这一年来，全国商业各部门的广大职工，怀着深厚的阶级感情，更加自觉地更有组织和有领导地开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他们运用轮训班、班前班后会、讲用会等多种形式，反复学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》等著作，并且联系自己的思想，检查对照，认真改造自己的世界观。许多职工通过学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》，检查批判了轻商思想、名位观念、雇佣观点和形形色色的资本主义经营思想，进一步树立了一心为革命，一心为人民的“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的世界观。广大革命职工豪迈地提出：要把商业企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校；要做无产阶级的政治家，不做资产阶级的买卖人，为革命站一辈子柜台；要像人民解放军那样，把商业队伍造就成为一支革命化的全心全意为人民服务的子弟兵。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动开展以来，广大商业职工革命精神更加振奋，他们明确地认识到商业部门是无产阶级与资产阶级，社会主义与资本主义两条道路斗争的重要阵地，这里有经济方面的斗争，也有政治、思想上的斗争。因此，广大革命职工，结合社会主义教育运动，积极投入了这场史无前例的伟大革命运动。他们积极配合各地红卫兵，大破四旧，大立四新，改变了某些方面存在着的资本主义的经营方式和经营作风，使市场面貌发生了深刻的变化，更加鲜明地显示出为工农业生产服务、为工农兵服务的社会主义市场的特点。这些重大改革，受到广大工农兵群众最热烈的欢迎和最坚决的支持。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大商业职工，还把无比高涨的革命积极性用到收购、供应、调运、保管等业务工作里面去，把精神力量迅速转化为巨大的物质力量，从而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。（附图片）
