	In the wake of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense spokesperson's stern exposure and condemnation of the recent repeated violations of Chinese airspace by U.S. aggressor aircraft, the U.S. authorities were in a state of panic and utter disarray.

	On September 17, our Ministry of National Defense spokesperson once again lodged a strong protest against the U.S. government's war provocations. Chinese newspapers also published photographs of the auxiliary fuel tanks and rocket launcher wreckage dropped by the U.S. aggressor aircraft as they were intercepted and fled in disarray by our People's Air Force. Faced with irrefutable evidence, U.S. State Department spokesman McCloskey was forced to stammer on September 19 and admit the U.S. crimes, saying that the U.S. had "investigated the allegations of the attacks on September 9 and September 17, and it is possible that after the air battle over North Vietnam, there may have been unintentional incursions into Communist China's airspace."

	While trying to cover up and downplay the deliberate violations of Chinese airspace by U.S. aggressor aircraft, he also attempted to deny the serious crime of these aggressor aircraft indiscriminately strafing Chinese villages and civilians. However, his efforts were futile. On one hand, he said, "U.S. aircraft have not conducted such attacks"; but when pressed by reporters, he added that he did not want to "categorically deny" the possibility. The facts are clear, and the Johnson administration's attempts to cover up and deny this new act of aggression against the Chinese people are not only in vain but will only further expose its ugly face as a bandit and a liar in front of the world's people.

    在我国防部发言人揭露美帝战争挑衅罪行后
    美国政府被迫承认美机侵犯我领空
    新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：在中国国防部发言人严正揭露和谴责美国强盗飞机最近连续侵犯我国领空的罪行后，美国当局手忙脚乱，十分狼狈。
    我国防部发言人十七日再次对美国政府的战争挑衅罪行提出了强烈抗议，我国报纸还发表了美国强盗飞机遭我人民空军截击、狼狈逃窜时扔下的副油箱和火箭发射架残骸的图片。在铁证面前，美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基十九日被迫吞吞吐吐地承认了美国的罪行，说什么美国“已经调查了有关九月九日和九月十七日的袭击的指责，在北越上空的空战结束后，可能发生了无意中侵入共产党中国的领空的行为”。
    他在竭力掩饰和冲淡美国强盗飞机蓄意侵犯我国领空的同时，还企图抵赖这些强盗飞机曾经疯狂扫射我村庄和平民的严重罪行。但是，欲盖弥彰。他一方面说：“美国飞机并没有进行过这种袭击”；而在记者的追问下，他又说，他不想“断然否定”这种可能性。事实俱在，约翰逊政府企图掩饰和抵赖它对中国人民犯下的这一新的侵略罪行不仅是徒劳的，而且只会进一步在世界人民面前暴露它的强盗兼骗子手的丑恶嘴脸。
