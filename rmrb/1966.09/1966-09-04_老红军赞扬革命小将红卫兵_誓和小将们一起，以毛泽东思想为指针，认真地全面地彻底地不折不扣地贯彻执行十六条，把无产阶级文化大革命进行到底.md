Many units of the People's Liberation Army's old Red Army soldiers are brimming with revolutionary fervor, highly praising the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards who have taken the lead in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and enthusiastically acclaiming the great achievements of the Red Guards in destroying the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News." They declare that they will carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and being good at struggling from the old Red Guards, forever preserve their revolutionary youth, resolutely become the strong backing of the Red Guards, and together with the revolutionary youngsters, with Mao Zedong Thought as the compass, earnestly, comprehensively, thoroughly, and unconditionally implement the "Sixteen Points," and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Many old Red Army soldiers who followed Chairman Mao in his southern and northern campaigns have held symposiums and written articles, unanimously acclaiming the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards as excellent, praising them as fearless and daring revolutionaries nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought. A certain unit's old Red Army soldier, Zhou Changju, said, "The Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the momentum of overturning mountains and the force of thunder, are cleansing the muddy waters left by the old society, just like the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army fighting against the reactionaries in the past, sweeping away thousands of enemies like rolling up a mat. This is truly heartening! We enthusiastically acclaim the great achievements created by the Red Guards. As an old member of the Red Guards, I sincerely pay my respects to them and learn from them!" A certain unit's old member of the Red Guards, Hu Xiaowu, who participated in a peasant uprising 39 years ago, said, "The revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards is excellent. Revolution is about millions of revolutionary masses rising up to rebel against the old world. More than 30 years ago, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, we rebelled against the Kuomintang, overthrowing the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people, and establishing New China. Today, the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards is precisely the inheritance and development of the revolutionary spirit of the older generation of revolutionaries. With this revolutionary spirit, we will definitely smash the remnants of feudalism, eliminate the poison of capitalism, and cut off the roots of revisionism. We will definitely stand firmly with the Red Guards and be their strongest backing."

Many old Red Army soldiers have drawn a common conclusion from their personal experiences of following Chairman Mao in revolution: Chairman Mao's words are all truths, the path guided by Chairman Mao is the path to victory, and the policies formulated by Chairman Mao are our lifeline. In the Cultural Revolution, these old Red Army soldiers have even more diligently studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and through various forms, encouraged the revolutionary youngsters to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and learning to struggle in the struggle. A certain unit's old Red Army soldier, Yao Dezhi, said, "In the past, we defeated the armed enemies with Mao Zedong Thought. Today, the revolutionary youngsters are also relying on Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the bourgeois 'authorities,' making them lose their prestige, and smashing the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, making them fall like flowers, and all trampled underfoot, causing a great change in the spiritual face of the whole society." A certain unit's old Red Army soldier, Luo Youde, knew that his daughter participated in the Red Guards in school and changed her name to Luo Jihong. He happily gave his daughter a set of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" he had read, saying to his daughter, "Jihong means to inherit Mao Zedong Thought and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. I hope you will read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good student of Chairman Mao." After receiving this precious book, the daughter was moved and expressed her determination, saying, "I will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, learn to swim while swimming, learn to struggle in the struggle, and in the Cultural Revolution, be a pioneer and a vanguard, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end."

    老红军赞扬革命小将红卫兵
    誓和小将们一起，以毛泽东思想为指针，认真地全面地彻底地不折不扣地贯彻执行十六条，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    据新华社三日讯　人民解放军许多部队的红军老战士，满怀革命激情，高度赞扬在无产阶级文化大革命中充当急先锋的红卫兵的革命行动，热烈欢呼红卫兵小将们破“四旧”立“四新”所创建的伟大功勋。他们表示，要把老赤卫队员们敢于斗争、善于斗争的革命造反精神发扬光大，永葆革命的青春，坚决做红卫兵们的坚强后盾，和革命小将们一起，以毛泽东思想为指针，认真地、全面地、彻底地、不折不扣地贯彻执行十六条，誓夺无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    曾经跟随毛主席南征北战的许多红军老战士纷纷开座谈会，写文章，同声欢呼红卫兵小将们的无产阶级革命造反精神好得很，赞扬他们是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的天不怕、地不怕的革命闯将。某部红军老战士周昌举说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵小将们，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，荡涤旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水，正像当年工农红军向着反动派开战一样，“横扫千军如卷席”，真是大快人心！我们热烈欢呼红卫兵小将们创立的伟大功勋。我这个当年的老赤卫队员，衷心地向他们致敬，向他们学习！某部曾在三十九年前参加过农民暴动的老赤卫队员胡孝武说，红卫兵小将们的无产阶级革命造反精神好得很，革命就是要千百万革命群众起来造旧世界的反。三十多年前，我们在毛主席的英明领导下，大造国民党的反，推倒了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，建立了新中国。今天，红卫兵小将们的这种革命造反精神，正是老一辈革命者的革命造反精神的继承和发扬。有了这种革命精神，就一定能砸烂封建主义的残余，消灭资本主义的毒菌，斩断修正主义的老根。我们一定坚决站在红卫兵一边，誓作他们最坚强的后盾。
    许多红军老战士从他们跟随毛主席闹革命的亲身经历中得出一个共同的结论，毛主席的话句句是真理，毛主席指引的道路是胜利的道路，毛主席制定的政策是我们的生命线。在文化大革命运动中，这些红军老战士们更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，并且通过各种形式勉励革命小将们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，在斗争中学会斗争。某部红军老战士姚得智说，过去我们靠毛泽东思想打败了拿枪的敌人。今天，革命小将们同样是靠毛泽东思想，把资产阶级“权威”斗得威风扫地，把资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，打得落花流水，统统踩到脚下，使整个社会精神面貌发生了巨大的变化。某部红军老战士罗有德晓得自己的女儿在学校里参加了红卫兵，并改名叫罗继红，他高兴地把自己读过的一套《毛泽东著作选读》赠给女儿，他对女儿说：继红，就是要继承毛泽东思想，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。希望你好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好学生。女儿接过这部宝书后，激动地表示决心说：我一定响应毛主席的伟大号召，在游泳中学会游泳，在斗争中学会斗争，在文化大革命中做闯将，当尖兵，把文化大革命进行到底。
