Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the young Red Guards bravely launched a fierce assault on the old world, sweeping all before them and reporting victories. The great deeds of the Red Guards in destroying the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News" have inspired the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army.

Recently, the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Air Force held a poetry evening to praise the Red Guards. The officers and soldiers, with high revolutionary enthusiasm, sang with the most beautiful verses: Fight on, heroic Red Guards!

The evening began with the deputy director of the Revolutionary Military Committee, Shi Rihai, singing:

Six hundred million people in China are red with fire,
The motherland is spring everywhere.
The revolutionary young people have great aspirations,
Bravely destroying the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News."
Dare to speak, dare to do, dare to make a revolution,
In all five continents and four seas, fame is spread.
Offering poems to praise the young Red Guards,
Expressing the soldiers' hearts.

With enthusiastic applause, the venue immediately became lively.

The model soldier Chen Yichun followed with a song:

Red Guards,
Red hearts to the Party.
Listen to Chairman Mao's words,
Dare to speak out;
Great criticism,
Fight and expose the ghosts and snakes;
Great rebellion,
Throw the "Four Olds" into the garbage bin;
Revolutionary teachers and students seize back the cultural battlefield,
Let the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high!

The model soldier Bai Choulin then recited:

Red young guards,
Red hearts and bright eyes,
Sweeping away all ghosts and snakes,
The battles fought are truly magnificent.

The platoon leader Zhao Dongfang sang:

The young guards wield the heavy hammer,
Daring to make the sun and moon change the sky;
Thousands of years of "garbage" turn to ashes,
The land of China is full of spring everywhere.

The great deeds of the Red Guards inspired the hearts of all officers and soldiers. The deputy political instructor Zhou Duan could not suppress his inner excitement and sang loudly:

Beat the war drums,
Blow the military horns,
Launch a great revolutionary storm,
For the victory of the revolution,
The Red Guards pave the way by breaking mountains.

The thoughts of the Red Guards are red as fire,
The revolutionary will is as firm as steel,
Swear to defend Chairman Mao,
Swear to defend the Party Central Committee,
Let the great glory of Mao Zedong Thought,
Illuminate the hearts of the revolutionary people.

At this time, many officers and soldiers wanted to go on stage to recite poems, and the evening reached its climax.

The squad leader Jin Fengtong sang excitedly:

The mountains are calling,
The seas are roaring,
Six hundred million people in China are changing their appearance.
The Red Guards charge forward to destroy the "Four Olds",
Everywhere they propagate the Sixteen Points.

Every red heart is towards the Party,
Swear to turn the whole country into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

The old soldier Jin Yongtang, who had just finished his duty, held his gun and walked onto the stage, singing passionately:

People's soldiers,
Hold the pen and the gun tightly,
Support the Red Guards in making the revolution,
Swear to drive away tigers and wolves,
Smash the old world,
Tread the smooth path.

The class leader Chen Xisheng, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, recited:

Workers, peasants, soldiers,
Red Guards,
We have the same love,
We have the same hatred.
Who is our enemy,
Who is our friend,
We see it clearly!

Young guards,
Fight to the end,
Workers, peasants, and soldiers will always be your strong support.

As Chen Xisheng's voice faded, the soldier Yu Jiamu followed with a song:

The Red Guards lead the way,
Holding high the red flag and dancing with the east wind,
Taking big strides on the revolutionary road,
The Sixteen Points are remembered in the heart.
Learn in struggle,
Use in struggle,
Master the policy of struggle well.
Act according to the Sixteen Points.

The deputy company commander Shi Qishan, who participated in the evening, also stood up excitedly and sang:

The Yangtze River,
Waves surging,
Heroes emerge in this era,
Rise up to smash the old world,
The revolution knows no age.

Remembering the past,
Blowing the military horns,
Following Chairman Mao to fight south and north and exterminate the enemy.
Looking at today,
Red young guards,
Holding high the red torch.
The revolutionary successors,
Chairman Mao's good students are the most reliable.
The Red Guards are the future of China,
The pride of humanity.

At the most lively moment of the evening, the messenger Zhu Shijun ran into the venue and announced a thrilling piece of good news: Chairman Mao had received the Red Guards again at Tiananmen. Immediately, the entire venue became excited. The wall newspaper editor Wu Lian, with tears of excitement, sang loudly:

The red sun rises in the east,
Chairman Mao stands on Tiananmen Gate,
Reviewing the revolutionary troops,
Receiving the Red Guard young guards again,
This is the happiness of the people of the whole country,
This is the glory of the Red Guards.
Respected Chairman Mao,
Respected Party Central Committee,
We will always follow you,
Resolutely implement the Sixteen Points,
Carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Advance, comrades,
For the great ideal of communism,
Always follow the supreme commander Chairman Mao,
Break the waves,
Fight bravely!

Thousands of songs and millions of words cannot express the soldiers' reverence for Chairman Mao, nor can they sing out the determination to support the revolutionary young Red Guards. Many comrades wanted to stand up and sing, but the lights had already gone out. The host Shi Rihai proposed that all the comrades in the company stand up and shout together:

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
