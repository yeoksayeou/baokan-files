The workers of the East Is Red Cement Plant (formerly known as the Qixin Cement Plant) in Tangshan, Hebei, have used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon in the socialist education and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have smashed the bourgeois technical "authorities," promoting a great development in production. The cement output has risen month by month, and in August, a new production record was created that has rarely been seen in recent years. The quality of the cement is more stable, the grades are more reasonable, and the cost is gradually decreasing.

    东方红水泥厂产量月月上升
    河北唐山东方红水泥厂（原名启新水泥厂）广大职工，在社会主义教育和文化大革命运动中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大破资产阶级技术“权威”，推动了生产大发展，水泥产量月月上升，八月份创造了近几年来少有的生产新纪录。水泥质量更加稳定，标号更加合理，成本也逐步降低。
