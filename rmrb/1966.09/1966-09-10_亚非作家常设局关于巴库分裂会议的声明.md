The Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau deems it necessary to issue another statement to inform all writers and peoples of the two continents about the true situation at the splitist meeting in Baku, Soviet Union.

First of all, we express our deep respect and high regard for the writers of the Afro-Asian countries who responded to our call on August 15, 1966, ignored the conspiracies and tricks of the Soviet splitists to lure them into attending the anti-revolutionary Afro-Asian Writers' Movement, and dealt a heavy blow to the Soviet revisionists, causing the Baku meeting to suffer a miserable failure.

Only a small number of writers from seventeen Afro-Asian countries attended this splitist meeting in Baku. Some of them were deceived and unaware of the conspiracies of the Soviet splitists; others were traitors and reactionaries—accomplices of the splitists; and still others had extremely limited representativeness. To cover up the weak response from the Afro-Asian region to their call, the Soviet splitists had to invite some guests from Latin American and European countries, even from the United States, to fill the numbers. Even so, they could not hide their failure.

An analysis of the statements made by the Soviet splitists before and during the Baku splitist meeting, as well as the responses from the few participants to these statements, reveals that the Soviet splitists have fallen into a state of complete isolation and despair.

On August 16, the Soviet splitists declared in Moscow that all participants would take part in all debates in Baku. According to a report from "Tass" in Baku, the secretary of the Soviet Afro-Asian Writers' Liaison Committee, Chugunov, on September 1, called on Soviet and foreign writers to support the resolutions passed at the Cairo splitist meeting in June. At this splitist meeting, Chugunov also said in a mournful tone that the success or failure of the Cairo splitist meeting would depend on their own and other member countries' effective support for the pseudo-Cairo Secretariat.

However, it is significant that, apart from the Soviet Union, no other country supported the resolutions and statements adopted at the end of the Baku splitist meeting or had any connection with them. At the end of the Baku splitist meeting, the Soviet splitists had to perform a solo act, issuing a "call," a "statement," and a "resolution" in the name of the Soviet Writers' Union.

In this "call," the Soviet splitists hypocritically said that they opposed "anything that would cause division in the ranks of writers from all continents."

In contrast to the divisive activities initiated by the dishonest people of the Soviet Writers' Union, anyone with common sense can see how ridiculous and shameless these statements are. It is well known that when the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau hoped they would agree to hold an emergency meeting in Beijing to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression, it was precisely this group of splitists who orchestrated the Cairo splitist meeting in June. They talk about unity but practice division. They talk about opposing American imperialism but practice capitulation. In reality, they are serving American imperialists through their criminal activities of splitting the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement.

In their "statement," the Soviet revisionists exposed their true intentions regarding their alleged support for the Vietnamese people. The "statement" said, "In our view, the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point proposal of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are the reasonable basis for a political solution to the Vietnamese question." This indicates that they hope to sell out the interests of the Vietnamese people through so-called negotiations on this basis, indicating that they are unwilling to support the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American aggression until the American aggressors are completely driven out of Vietnam and final victory is achieved.

This is the Soviet revisionists' false support and true betrayal of the heroic Vietnamese people. Facts increasingly prove that the Soviet revisionists not only do not support Vietnam but even do not mention Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Call" issued on July 17, 1966.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on all compatriots to fight to the end, requested friendly countries to strongly support and assist the Vietnamese people until they achieve complete victory in the struggle against American aggression. At the same time, he said that the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point proposal of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam are the only way to solve the Vietnamese question, and there is no other way. However, the Soviet revisionists said that these four points and five points could only serve as the reasonable basis for a political solution. Thus, the Soviet revisionists once again exposed themselves as the number one accomplice of the American imperialists who are trying to force a "bombing for peace" solution.

In their "resolution," the Soviet splitists stated that their "most important task" is to fully support the pseudo "Cairo Secretariat." This is another example of their public declaration of their intent to continue their divisive activities while hypocritically calling for unity. Splitting the Afro-Asian Writers' Movement has become their most important task.

Chugunov also said in his speech at the Baku splitist meeting that the executive committee of the writers' organization would hold a meeting to affirm the resolutions passed at the Cairo splitist meeting and to decide the time and place for the convening of the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference.

This can only indicate that Chugunov is the real secretary of the pseudo-Cairo Secretariat. He seems to have forgotten the fact that twenty-three member countries of the executive committee, including twenty countries, and fifty-three countries and five international organizations in Asia and Africa, have condemned and criticized the Cairo splitist meeting at the emergency meeting held in Beijing and decided that the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference will be held in China. Yet he now says that another executive committee meeting will be held to affirm the Cairo splitist meeting. This shows how desperate they are!

Chugunov himself, as a Soviet writer, participated in the executive committee meeting held in Bali, Indonesia, in 1963. This meeting adopted the agenda for the Third Conference and entrusted the Permanent Bureau and the host country (Indonesia) to make all necessary preparations for the convening of the Third Conference. Due to the current terror and anti-people activities of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime in Indonesia and their betrayal of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples, the Indonesian writers proposed at the Beijing emergency meeting, attended by fifty-three Asian and African countries and regions, including twenty executive committee member countries, that the Third Conference be held in China. Twenty executive committee countries accepted this proposal with the support of thirty-three other Asian and African countries. The legitimacy, effectiveness, and validity of this resolution are beyond doubt. The news that the next Afro-Asian Writers' Conference will be held in China has been warmly welcomed by Afro-Asian writers and peoples.

The executive secretariat established last month in Beijing is preparing to convene the Third Conference according to this resolution. Everyone is aware of these facts. Therefore, the Soviet splitists, despite these solemn resolutions, mention holding another executive committee meeting to decide the issue of the Third Conference, which is not only illegal, arbitrary, and absurd but also a deliberate attempt to further expand their divisive activities. In the face of the powerful revolutionary tide of Afro-Asian writers, do the Soviet splitists not see their dim future? Do they not understand that what awaits them is an even more miserable failure than the Baku splitist meeting?

We call on all Afro-Asian writers to be vigilant, strengthen unity, and closely watch the illegal and absurd conspiracies and sabotage activities of the Soviet splitists, and deal them an even heavier blow to completely and thoroughly smash their conspiracies.

### 亚非作家常设局关于巴库分裂会议的声明

    亚非作家常设局关于巴库分裂会议的声明
    亚非作家常设局认为有必要再发表一次声明，以使两大洲所有的作家和人民了解苏联巴库分裂会议上的真实情况。
    首先，让我们对那些亚非国家的作家表示深切的敬意和高度的重视，他们响应了我们一九六六年八月十五日的呼吁，不理睬苏联分裂主义者要求他们参加反对革命的亚非作家运动的阴谋诡计，给了苏联修正主义者沉重的打击，使巴库会议遭到了惨败。
    参加这次巴库分裂会议的只有十七个亚非国家的一部分人，他们中间有一些是受到了蒙蔽，不明苏联分裂主义者幕后的阴谋诡计；而另一些是叛徒和反动派——分裂主义者的帮凶；还有一些人的代表性则是极微不足道的。为了掩盖亚非地区对他们号召的微弱的反应，苏联分裂主义者不得不从拉丁美洲和欧洲国家，甚至从美国邀请了一些客人来滥竽充数。即使如此，他们也掩盖不了他们的惨败。
    分析一下苏联分裂主义者在巴库分裂会议之前和会议期间的言论以及那寥寥无几的与会者对这些言论的反应，就能看出苏联分裂主义者已经陷于完全孤立和绝望的境地。
    苏联分裂主义者八月十六日在莫斯科曾宣称，所有与会者将在巴库参加所有的辩论。据“塔斯社”从巴库发出的报道，苏联亚非作家联络委员会负责书记丘古诺夫在九月一日曾呼吁苏联和外国文学家支持六月开罗分裂会议上通过的决议。在这次分裂会议上，丘古诺夫还用悲哀的语调说，开罗分裂会议的成败将取决于他们自己以及其他成员国对伪开罗书记处的有效支持。
    然而，有意义的是：除苏联之外，没有一个国家支持巴库分裂会议最后通过的决议和发表的声明，或与它们有任何的牵连。巴库分裂会议结束时，苏联分裂主义者只好自己唱独脚戏，以苏联作家组织的名义发表了一个“呼吁书”，一个“声明”和一项“决议”。
    在这个“呼吁书”中，苏联分裂主义者虚伪地说什么“他们反对在各大洲文学家友好队伍中引起分裂的任何东西。”
    对照一下苏联作家协会这些不正直的人开创的分裂活动，任何有常识的人都可以看出这些言论是多么的可笑和无耻。众所周知，当亚非作家常设局希望他们赞成在北京召开支援越南人民反美侵略斗争的亚非作家紧急会议的时候，正是这伙分裂主义者在今年六月策划了开罗分裂会议。他们嘴上讲的是团结，干的是分裂。他们嘴上讲的是反对美帝国主义，干的是投降主义。他们实际上是以分裂亚非作家运动的罪恶活动来为美帝国主义者效劳的。
    在他们的“声明”中，苏联修正主义者暴露了他们所谓对越南人民支持的真面目。“声明”说，“在我们看来，越南民主共和国政府的四项和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点是越南问题政治解决的合理基础。”这表明了他们希望在这个基础上通过所谓的谈判解决来出卖越南人民的利益，表明了他们不愿意支持越南人民把决战决胜的反美斗争进行到美国侵略者全部被赶出越南和取得最后胜利。　
    这是苏联修正主义者对英雄的越南人民的假支持，真出卖。事实越来越清楚地证明：苏联修正主义者不但不支持越南，甚至连胡志明主席一九六六年七月十七日发表的《号召书》也只字不提。
    胡志明主席呼吁全国同胞把斗争进行到底，请求友好国家大力支援和帮助越南人民，直到取得反美斗争的完全胜利。同时，他说，越南民主共和国的四项和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点是解决越南问题的唯一的办法，除此之外，没有其他出路。但是苏联修正主义者却说，这四项和五点只能作为政治解决的合理基础。这样，苏联修正主义者再一次暴露了他们是企图进行“以炸迫和”的美帝国主义者的头号帮凶。
    在他们的“决议”中，苏联分裂主义者把全力支持伪“开罗常设局书记处”作为他们“最重要的任务”。这是他们在虚伪地呼吁团结的同时，公开表示他们执意要继续进行分裂活动的又一例证。分裂亚非作家运动已经成了他们最重要的任务。
    丘古诺夫在巴库分裂会议上的讲话中还说，作家组织的执行委员会将召开一次会议来肯定在开罗分裂会议上所通过的决议，并解决第三届亚非作家大会召开的时间和地点问题。
    这只能表明，丘古诺夫是伪开罗常设局真正的秘书长。他似乎已经忘了这个事实：包括二十三个执行委员会成员国中二十个国家在内的五十三个国家和五个亚非国际组织已经在北京召开的紧急会议上谴责和抨击了开罗分裂会议，并决定第三届亚非作家大会将在中国召开。而他现在却说要另外召开执行委员会会议来肯定开罗分裂会议。这表明他们是多么绝望！
    丘古诺夫本人曾以苏联作家的身份参加了一九六三年在印度尼西亚巴厘召开的执行委员会会议。这次会议通过了第三届大会的议程，并委托常设局和东道国（印度尼西亚）为第三届大会的召开作一切必要的准备。由于目前苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事政权在印度尼西亚所进行的恐怖和反人民的活动，以及他们对亚非人民反帝斗争事业的背叛，东道国印度尼西亚作家向拥有五十三个亚非国家和地区，其中包括二十个执行委员会成员国参加的北京紧急会议建议第三届大会在中国举行。二十个执委会国家在其他三十三个亚非国家的支持下接受了这个建议。这个决议的正规性、有效性和合法性是不容置疑的。在中国举行下一届亚非作家会议的消息已经受到亚非作家和人民的热烈欢迎。
    上月在北京成立的执行书记处正在根据这个决议筹备召开第三届大会。所有的人是很了解这些事实的。因此，苏联分裂主义者不顾这些庄严的决议竟提及召开另一次执行委员会会议来决定第三届大会的问题，不但是非法、专横和荒谬的，而且也是蓄意进一步扩大他们的分裂活动。在亚非作家强大的革命潮流面前，难道苏联分裂主义者自己还看不到他们暗淡的前景吗？难道他们还不了解等待着他们的是比巴库分裂会议更加悲惨的失败吗？
    我们呼吁所有亚非作家提高警惕，加强团结，密切地注意苏联分裂主义者的非法和荒唐的阴谋破坏活动，并给他们以更加沉重的打击，使他们的阴谋遭到完全、彻底的粉碎。　（新华社九日讯）
