The revolutionary people of the whole world are achieving a great victory. China is currently in a great situation. In socialist China, a great upsurge of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has been launched. This is not only a matter concerning China's future but also a major issue concerning the future of the revolutionary people of the whole world. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have united to deliver a crushing blow to revisionist and bourgeois ideas. I am convinced that this is a great victory for the Chinese people and at the same time a great victory for the people of the whole world.

    全世界革命人民的伟大胜利
    中国正处于大好形势中。在社会主义的中国，掀起了一个无产阶级文化大革命的高潮。这不仅仅是关系到中国前途的问题，而且是关系到全世界革命人民前途的重大问题。中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，团结起来给予修正主义思想和资产阶级思想以毁灭性的打击。我确信这是中国人民的伟大胜利，同时也是全世界人民的伟大胜利。
