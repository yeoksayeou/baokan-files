Denial is Unacceptable

On September 9th and 17th, U.S. imperialist warplanes successively invaded our airspace, conducting frenzied strafing and reconnaissance provocations. The U.S. planes were hit by our People's Air Force. A fuel tank and rocket debris dropped by a fleeing U.S. plane fell within our borders. The evidence is irrefutable, and the guilt is undeniable.

On the 19th, the U.S. State Department spokesman was forced to admit that there "may have been an unintended incursion into Communist China's airspace." What "may have been"! This is clearly another indisputable crime committed by U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people. What "unintended"! This is clearly a deliberate act of war provocation by U.S. imperialism. The U.S. State Department's statement is, in fact, an admission to the world that U.S. imperialism has repeatedly and deliberately violated our airspace and conducted military provocations.

U.S. imperialism is both a robber and a scoundrel. The U.S. State Department spokesman, while forced to admit the crime of invading Chinese airspace, also desperately denies that U.S. planes "did not conduct air raids on Communist Party territory." However, even this official does not dare to "categorically deny" that U.S. plane fuel tanks, shells, or bullets fell within our borders. If there were no air raids, how could U.S. plane fuel tanks, shells, or bullets fall within Chinese territory? The U.S. State Department spokesman has slapped himself in the face.

The U.S. robber is a big pus-filled wound. The invading planes were clearly beaten, yet the U.S. State Department spokesman does not dare to admit that Chinese People's Air Force planes hit them, vaguely stating that the "nationality of these planes could not be identified." Look, how weak U.S. imperialism is!

We warn the Johnson administration: your crimes are undeniable. Your denials prove that you still intend to provoke war against the Chinese people. Fine! If you dare to come again, we will definitely fight back decisively. The Chinese people will not be polite to you.

    抵赖是不行的
    本报评论员
    九月九日和十七日，美帝国主义军用飞机接连侵入我国领空，进行疯狂扫射和侦察挑衅。美机被我人民空军击伤。一架美机逃窜时扔掉的副油箱和火箭残骸，落在我国境内。铁证如山，罪责难逃。
    美国国务院发言人十九日被迫承认，“可能发生了无意中侵入共产党中国的领空的行为”。什么“可能”！这明明是美帝国主义对中国人民又一次犯下的证据确凿的罪行。什么“无意”！这明明是美帝国主义蓄意的战争挑衅。美国国务院的声明，实际上就是向全世界招认了美帝国主义确确实实接二连三侵犯我国领空、进行军事挑衅的罪行。
    美帝国主义是强盗，也是无赖。美国国务院发言人一面被迫承认犯了入侵中国领空的罪行，一面又竭力抵赖说，美国飞机并没有“对中国共产党领土进行空袭”。但是，就是这个美国官员也不敢“断然否定”美机油箱、炮弹或子弹落在我国境内。如果没有进行空袭，美机的油箱、炮弹或子弹怎么会落在中国境内呢？美国国务院发言人自己打了自己的耳光。
    美国强盗是个大脓包。入侵的美机明明挨了揍，而美国国务院发言人却不敢承认中国人民空军的飞机打了它们，含糊其词地说什么这些飞机的“国籍没有辨认出来”。请看，美帝国主义是多么虚弱！
    我们要警告约翰逊政府：你们的罪行是抵赖不掉的。你们抵赖，证明你们还要对中国人民进行战争挑衅。好吧！你们敢再来，我们就一定坚决地打。中国人民对你们，是决不讲客气的。
