The Spring Festival of 1966 was a time of great joy for the people of our motherland. Meanwhile, on the western shore of the Indian Ocean, at the Horn of Africa, a team of white-clad warriors dispatched by our motherland was experiencing many sleepless nights while struggling to save a young Somali child.

Four-year-old Ibrahim had a foreign object lodged in his trachea, causing severe obstruction. His father had taken him to two hospitals already. They first went to the Soviet medical team in their hometown of Kismayo, but the Soviet doctors replied, "Given the conditions, we cannot accept him." The reason they coldly turned away the patient was that the child had to be sent to the Diggah Medical Center in the capital, Mogadishu, run by the "European Economic Community," where the equipment was "unparalleled." Thus, father and son traveled over 400 kilometers in a day, arriving at this grand hospital in the capital, covered in dust. However, the response from the Western doctors was another bucket of cold water: "The child's condition is so severe; whether he lives or dies, we don't care. You sign here first!" So, the father had no choice but to take his beloved son and angrily leave these Western doctors who treated the lives of Africans as mere grass, and rushed to the Matteini Hospital where the Chinese medical team was working. He entrusted his child's life to the Chinese doctors.

When the Chinese medical team saw the child, his condition was already very serious. Days of respiratory distress, inability to eat, and he was barely breathing, urgently needing rescue. Although the Chinese medical team had an ENT specialist, the hospital's equipment was far inferior to that of the Diggah Medical Center, and they didn't even have a tracheoscope for examining the trachea. In this situation, diagnosing the condition and starting treatment was indeed difficult.

At 2 a.m., the Chinese medical team held a meeting under the lights, repeatedly discussing the child's condition. They believed: The revisionist and imperialist doctors could turn a blind eye to death and neglect human lives, but as medical personnel sent by Chairman Mao from New China, they could not stand idly by when facing the pain of the Somali people. Chairman Mao's teachings on "serving the people of the world" were inspiring them, and a strong sense of internationalism and revolutionary humanitarianism was driving them. After discussion, they reached a unanimous conclusion: Rescuing little Ibrahim was an unavoidable responsibility for the Chinese medical personnel, and they must snatch the child back from the clutches of death! They must use Mao Zedong Thought to compete with the Western doctors!

At 4 a.m., the city of Mogadishu was still asleep. The doctors drove away their sleepiness, walked into the hospital under the starlit sky, and began the urgent rescue work. They first performed intravenous therapy and other supportive measures, followed by a tracheotomy. This temporarily solved the child's breathing difficulties, but the foreign object causing the child's life-threatening condition was not found.

Due to the child's extreme weakness, he developed severe staphylococcal pneumonia, and frequent asphyxia occurred, bringing him to the brink of death several times. The entire team, in close cooperation with the Somali nurses, took turns guarding the child day and night, injecting him with penicillin sent from the motherland, finally controlling the severe infection.

Two weeks passed, and little Ibrahim's breathing stabilized. They then performed the tube removal surgery. However, on the third day after the tube removal, the patient fell into asphyxia again. At this critical moment, a tracheoscope was urgently needed for examination, but in Somalia, the only tracheoscope was at the Diggah Medical Center. The director of Matteini Hospital, Hassan, personally went to borrow it. At this time, these imperialists tore off their "charitable" masks, revealing their ferocious faces. They first refused to lend it, and after much negotiation, they provided a large-sized tracheoscope, which a four-year-old child could not possibly accommodate. If they asked again, they gave a broken scope without a light source.

"The greatest difficulties cannot defeat us!" The Chinese medical team made up their minds to overcome all obstacles and strive for victory. After another thorough clinical discussion, they decided to perform a second tracheotomy on little Ibrahim. This time, they used a high incision and carefully probed with a probe from all directions. Finally, a small, oval-shaped bead rolled out from below the child's vocal cords.

Little Ibrahim was saved! The people in the operating room jumped for joy. When this green plastic bead was handed to the father, who was anxiously waiting outside the operating room, he had tears in his eyes, tightly grasping the hands of the Chinese medical staff, and for a long time could not find the words to express his gratitude.

Half a year later, little Ibrahim and his family in their hometown of Kismayo, south of the equator, sent greetings to the Chinese doctors through someone else. Later, a Somali nurse who was transferred to work in another place would still eagerly talk about this rescue operation every time she returned to the capital to visit the Chinese doctors. They said that through this incident, they saw who the true friends of the Somali people were.

    毛泽东思想的威力
    ——记中国医疗队抢救索马里病童
    一九六六年的春节，在祖国正是万民欢腾的时候。而在印度洋西岸的非洲之角上，一队由祖国派出的白衣战士，却正为抢救一个索马里病童，经历着许多不眠之夜。
    四岁的易卜拉欣，由于异物进入了气管而发生了严重的气管阻塞，父亲抱着他已经辗转了两个医院。他们先到在他们家乡基斯马尤的苏联医疗队就诊，苏联医生答复是：“限于条件，难于接受”。他把病人冷酷推走的理由是：孩子必须送到设在首都摩加迪沙的“西欧共同市场”开办的狄克弗医院，那里的设备条件“首屈一指”。这样，父子两人经过一天的劳累，赶了四百多公里路，风尘仆仆地奔到首都的这所富丽堂皇的医院。可是那些西方国家的资产阶级医生们所给予的回答，又是劈头一瓢冷水：“孩子病情这么重，治死治活我们不管，你先签个字！”于是，这位父亲只好抱着他心爱的儿子，愤怒地离开这些视非洲人的人命为草芥的西方医生们，奔到了中国医疗队工作的马蒂诺医院。他把孩子的生命寄托于中国医生们。
    中国医疗队医生看到这个小孩时，孩子的病情已很严重。几天的气急，未能进食，已是气息奄奄，急需抢救。中国医疗队中虽有耳鼻喉专科医生，但是医院的设备条件确比狄克弗医院差得多，连检查气管用的气管镜也没有。在这种情况下，要确诊病情和着手抢治，确实有困难。
    午夜两点，中国医疗队在灯光下召开了全体人员会议，反复研究孩子的病情。他们认为：修正主义和殖民主义国家的医生可以见死不救，玩忽人命，而作为毛主席派出来的新中国医务人员，对于索马里人民的任何病痛却不能袖手旁观。毛主席的“为世界人民服务”的教导在激励着他们，强烈的国际主义的责任感和革命的人道主义精神在激励着他们。经过讨论，他们得出的一致结论是：抢救小易卜拉欣是中国医务人员无可推卸的责任，一定要把孩子从死神手中夺回来！一定要用毛泽东思想和西方医生较量一番！
    凌晨四点，摩加迪沙全城还在沉睡中。医生们驱走了睡魔，顶着满天星斗走进了医院，开始了紧急的抢救工作。先进行输液等积极支持措施，随后进行了气管切开手术。这虽暂时解决了孩子的通气困难，但却没有发现使孩子生命垂危的异物。
    由于孩子的机体极度虚弱，发生了严重的葡萄球菌肺炎，窒息现象频繁地出现，而且几次濒临死亡。全队人员在索马里护士们的密切配合下，夜以继日地轮流守护着孩子，给孩子注射了祖国送来的红霉素，这才控制住了严重的感染。
    两个星期过去了，小易卜拉欣的呼吸平稳下来，便进行了除管手术。可是就在除管后的第三天，病人又陷于窒息状态。就在这个紧急关头，急需要气管镜进行检查，而在索马里，气管镜只有狄克弗医院有。中国医疗队所在的马蒂诺医院院长哈桑亲自登门求借。这时，这些殖民主义者就撕下了“慈善”的画皮，露出了凶恶的嘴脸。他们先是不借，后经多方交涉，他们给的气管镜却是大号的，一个四岁的小孩根本无法容纳。再要，则给一个没有光源的破镜子。
    “天大的困难也难不倒我们！”中国医疗队人员下定了排除万难去争取胜利的决心，经过再一次的周密的临床讨论，决定再给小易卜拉欣作第二次气管切开手术。这次他们采用高位切口，仔细地用探针从各方面探查。终于，从孩子的声门下边，滚出一颗椭圆形的珠子来。
    小易卜拉欣得救了！手术室的人高兴得跳起来。当这颗绿色的塑料珠子，传递到怀着忐忑的心情等候在手术室门外的父亲手里时，他眼里噙着泪水，紧握着中国医护人员的手，千言万语，齐集心头，久久找不出一句能够表达自己感谢的话来。
    半年后，小易卜拉欣和他的全家在赤道线以南的故乡基斯马尤，托人向中国医生们问好。后来调到外地工作的索马里护士，每次回首都探望中国医生时，还一再津津乐道地谈及这次抢救手术。她们说，通过这件事，她们看清了谁是索马里人民的真正朋友。
