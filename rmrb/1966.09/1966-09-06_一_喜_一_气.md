Title: One Joy, One Anger

Over the past few years, we have adhered to the principle that amateur cultural activities among the masses should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve proletarian politics. Whatever the poor and lower-middle peasants like, and whatever the Party needs, we write extensively. The works we write bring joy to the poor and lower-middle peasants, and make the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists furious. I recall that once, based on the facts of how the rich farmer Li Laoying framed the poor peasant Li Tie Tou, we wrote a story called "Li Laoying Steals a Chicken." One day, the storyteller told this story on the street, and the poor and lower-middle peasant community members gathered around, leaving no room for rain or wind. However, a rich farmer element slipped away quietly. Counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang, open your eyes and take a look. Can literature and art be accepted by all kinds of people? This fact further made us realize that the "all-people's literature and art" advocated by Zhou Yang is thoroughly revisionist.

    一“喜”一“气”
    河北省饶阳县五公大队　徐秀稳
    几年来，我们坚持了群众业余文艺活动为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的方针。凡是贫下中农喜欢的东西，凡是党所需要的东西，我们就大写而特写。我们写的作品，贫下中农看了喜，地富反坏右看了气。记得有一次，我们根据本村富农李老赢陷害贫农李铁头的罪恶事实，编写了个故事《李老赢偷鸡》。一天，故事员在街上讲这个故事，贫下中农社员围了个风雨不透，一个富农分子却悄悄地溜走了。反革命修正主义分子周扬，你睁开眼睛看一看，难道文艺能为各种人所接受吗？这一事实，使我们进一步地认识到，周扬鼓吹的“全民文艺”是彻头彻尾的修正主义货色。
