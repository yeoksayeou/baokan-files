The South Vietnamese Liberation Army heavily shelled the American military base at Phan Rang Airport, located approximately 160 kilometers northeast of Saigon, in the early hours of September 11. The enemy suffered significant losses.

According to Western news agencies, this attack is part of a series of recent strikes by the Liberation Army against American military installations. The first shell fired by the Liberation Army hit the fuel depot at Phan Rang Airport, causing a fire that burned for one and a half hours. An American military spokesman admitted that several American planes were damaged in the shelling.

According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency in Hanoi on September 9, guerrilla forces in the provinces of Quang Nam, Binh Dinh, My Tho, Binh Tuy, and Gia Dinh in South Vietnam have recently been using various makeshift weapons and those seized from the enemy to strike at the enemy.

In Quang Nam Province, the guerrillas in Tam Ky County's Ky Thuy Commune used unexploded American shells, ingeniously converting them into landmines. They laid these mines extensively, killing a large number of American invaders.
