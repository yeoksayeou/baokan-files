Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao teaches us that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. Chairman Mao also teaches us that to achieve this great revolution, we must use ideological struggle, not physical struggle.

Using ideological struggle means using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, using the forms of big debates, big wall posters, big character posters, and big discussions to expose, analyze, and criticize all those in power who are taking the capitalist road, as well as all anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary academic "authorities" for their heinous crimes.

Since our most beloved leader Chairman Mao ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we Red Guards of Peking University, along with the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, under the close care of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, fully utilizing the weapons of big debates, big wall posters, big character posters, and big discussions. We have written numerous revolutionary big character posters that are well-reasoned, analytical, and persuasive. We have held many struggle meetings and debate sessions. One big character poster after another, one struggle meeting and debate session after another, have exposed the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Luo Ping clique against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. Their cover-ups have been torn away, their paper tiger masks have been pierced, their arrogance has been swept away, and their restoration plots have been thoroughly foiled.

Through ideological struggle, the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students have gradually come to deeply understand how the Luo Ping clique stubbornly carried out the revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, how they suppressed, persecuted, and expelled students and cadres of worker-peasant origin; how they cultivated heirs of the bourgeoisie and revisionist seeds to serve their counter-revolutionary restoration plots; and how they resisted and sabotaged our school's socialist education movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Through ideological struggle, we Red Guards and the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have opened our eyes to understand what "peaceful evolution" is and what capitalist restoration is.

Through ideological struggle, we Red Guards and the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students have come to deeply feel that without Mao Zedong Thought, revolution is impossible!

In more than three months of struggle, we have deeply felt that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's directive to use ideological struggle and not physical struggle is extremely wise and great. We have personally experienced that only through ideological struggle can the Cultural Revolution be thoroughly carried out, and only through ideological struggle can all the ghosts and monsters be overthrown, smashed, and exposed!

We Red Guards are faithful guardians of Mao Zedong Thought. We must seriously, thoroughly, and unconditionally carry out Chairman Mao's personally formulated Sixteen Points, resolutely using the method of ideological struggle to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a thorough victory!

    我们的“实战”经验
    北京大学中文系红卫兵　陈征　朱景松　卢家丰
    我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席教导我们，无产阶级文化大革命是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。毛主席还教导我们，实现这一场大革命，要用文斗，不用武斗。
    用文斗，就是以毛泽东思想为武器，用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的形式，去揭露、分析、批判一切走资本主义道路的当权派，以及一切反动学术“权威”的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。
    自从我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火之后，我们北大的红卫兵战士，广大的革命师生员工，在党中央和毛主席的亲切关怀下，活学活用毛主席著作，充分运用了大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器，写出了大批充分说理的、有分析的、有说服力的革命的大字报，开了许多斗争会、辩论会。一张张革命的大字报，一场场斗争会、辩论会，把陆平黑帮反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命罪行揭露出来。他们的遮羞布被撕掉了，他们纸老虎的假面具被戳穿了，他们的威风扫地，复辟阴谋彻底破产。
    通过文斗，广大红卫兵战士、广大革命师生，逐步深刻地认识到，陆平黑帮是怎样顽固地执行前北京市委的修正主义路线，排挤、打击、迫害工农出身的同学和工农干部的；是怎样培养资产阶级接班人、修正主义苗子，为他们的反革命复辟阴谋服务的；是怎样抵制和破坏我校社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命的。
    通过文斗，我们广大红卫兵、广大革命师生员工擦亮了眼睛，认识到什么叫做“和平演变”，什么叫做资本主义复辟。
    通过文斗，我们红卫兵战士和广大革命师生更深刻地体会到：干革命，离开毛泽东思想就寸步难行！
    在三个多月的斗争中，我们深深体会到，党中央和毛主席关于要用文斗，不用武斗的指示是多么英明伟大。我们亲身体会到，只有文斗，才能把文化大革命搞彻底，才能把一切牛鬼蛇神斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    我们红卫兵是毛泽东思想的忠实卫士，我们一定要认真地、全面地、彻底地、不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席亲手制定的十六条，坚决用文斗的办法，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到彻底胜利！
