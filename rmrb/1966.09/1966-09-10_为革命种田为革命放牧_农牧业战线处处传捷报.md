Cultivating for the Revolution, Herding for the Revolution: Agricultural and Pastoral Fronts Report Victory After Victory

Qinghai's Wool Production Sees Significant Increase

Qinghai, renowned worldwide for its wool, has seen a significant increase in production. According to incomplete statistics from the procurement department, by the end of August, over 12 million jin of wool had been procured, an increase of about 10 percent compared to the same period last year. Additionally, sheep wool, cow hair, and camel hair products have also seen increased production.

Qinghai Province is one of China's major wool-producing regions. Since last winter and this spring, the Qinghai grasslands have experienced drought, with poor grass growth and some areas even facing difficulties in securing water for humans and livestock. The various ethnic herders have striven to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, with the spirit of moving mountains, fighting against the drought. They have used every means to dig wells, build irrigation canals, excavate springs, and transport ice to overcome the difficulties of securing water for humans and livestock. At the same time, they have adopted methods such as grazing on shaded slopes and strengthened the management of livestock, enhancing the animals' constitution, and ultimately achieving a good harvest of livestock products.

Yangzhou Region's Rice Production Increases

The 1.3 million mu of early-planted rice in Jiangsu's Yangzhou Region has been harvested and threshed, generally yielding more than the bumper harvest of last year.

Over the past three years, rice production in the Yangzhou Region has seen increases, but the margin of increase has been small compared to more advanced regions. This year, the vast majority of rural commune members in the entire region, while studying Chairman Mao's works, have firmly established the idea of cultivating for the revolution. They have broken away from outdated habits of conservative and rough farming, promoting Chen Yongkang's high-yield rice cultivation experience, thereby achieving even greater rice yields than last year's bumper harvest.

Tibet's Bomi County Sees Bumper Harvest

Tibet's Chamdo Region's Bomi County is currently harvesting ripe grain crops. This year, the broad masses of emancipated serfs have studied Chairman Mao's works, improved agricultural water conservancy, reformed cultivation techniques, and achieved a bumper harvest of grain.

The Yigong District faced both drought and pest infestations this year. Due to the heightened political awareness of the broad masses of farmers, they constructed a large number of small-scale water diversion and irrigation projects during the drought, simultaneously dispelled superstitions, and launched a mass pest eradication campaign, thereby preserving the young crops and achieving a bumper harvest. Poor peasant Solang Riju said, "This year's bumper harvest is thanks to Chairman Mao."

Heilongjiang's Flax Sees Good Harvest

One of China's major flax-producing regions, Heilongjiang Province, has seen a good harvest this year. Currently, various flax raw material factories are hurriedly procuring flax. From the flax already procured, the quality is better than in previous years, with the flax yield increasing by about 5 percent compared to last year.

This year, the broad masses of commune members in the province's flax-producing areas have earnestly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, further establishing the idea of serving the people and cultivating for the revolution. The flax has been planted carefully and managed well, with the yield per unit area and the total yield both increasing by more than 20 percent compared to last year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    农牧业战线处处传捷报
    青海羊毛显著增产
    驰名中外的青海羊毛获得显著增产。据收购部门的不完全统计，到八月底，已收购羊毛一千二百多万斤，比去年同期增长了百分之十左右。同时，羊绒、牛毛绒和驼毛等畜产品也得到增产。
    青海省是我国的重要羊毛产区之一。去冬今春以来，青海草原干旱，牧草生长不好，有些地方甚至人畜饮水也发生了困难。各族牧民努力活学活用毛主席著作，以愚公移山的精神，和干旱作斗争，他们千方百计地打井修渠，挖泉驮冰，战胜了人畜饮水的困难。同时采取阴坡放牧等办法，精心加强对牲畜的管理，增强了牲畜的体质，终于夺得了畜产品的好收成。
    扬州专区水稻增产
    江苏扬州专区的一百三十多万亩栽插较早的水稻已经收割登场，一般比丰收的去年增产。
    过去三年，扬州专区的水稻生产都是增产的，但是同先进地区比较，增产的幅度不大。今年全专区农村广大社员在学习毛主席著作中，大立为革命种田的思想。他们破除了因循守旧、耕作粗放的旧习惯，推广了陈永康的水稻高产经验，因而水稻比丰收的去年还增了产。
    西藏波密粮食丰收
    西藏昌都专区波密县正在收割黄熟的粮食作物。今年广大翻身农奴学习毛主席著作，兴修农田水利，改革耕作技术，夺得了粮食丰收。
    易贡区今年又旱又有虫害，由于广大农民政治觉悟提高，在抗旱中兴修了大量小型的引水灌溉工程，同时破除迷信，开展了群众性的灭虫运动，从而保住了青苗，夺得了丰收。贫农索朗日久说，今年丰收要感谢毛主席。
    黑龙江亚麻好收成
    我国主要亚麻产地之一的黑龙江省今年获得了好收成，目前各亚麻原料厂正在抓紧时机收购。从已经收购到的亚麻来看，质量比历年都好，出麻率比去年增加百分之五左右。
    今年全省亚麻产区的广大人民公社社员认真活学活用毛主席著作，进一步树立了为人民服务，为革命种田的思想，亚麻种得细、管得好，单位面积产量和总产量分别比去年增加了二成以上。　（据新华社电）
