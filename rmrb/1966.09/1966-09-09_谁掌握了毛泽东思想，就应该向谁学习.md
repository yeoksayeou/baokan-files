The senior officers of the Nanjing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, in the midst of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have taken Liu Yingjun as their model, conducted self-examinations, and shared their experiences in transforming their thinking. They expressed their revolutionary enthusiasm, stating that regardless of rank or seniority, those who master Mao Zedong Thought should be learned from. They believe that Liu Yingjun's life is a model for how to revolutionize in the latter half of one's life. To transform one's worldview like the revolutionary youth of the Mao Zedong era, one must establish high standards and a high attitude.

Using High Standards to View Flaws

Everyone believes that to have a thorough spirit of self-revolution like Liu Yingjun, one must first use high standards to examine one's own ideological transformation. Liu Yingjun did not merely solve ideological issues generally; he demanded that his thoughts, words, and deeds fully conform to Mao Zedong Thought. He often used Chairman Mao's teachings to strictly examine himself, even after doing good deeds, he would still compare himself to Chairman Mao's instructions and conduct self-criticism. This spirit of maintaining high standards in ideological transformation is something that a thorough revolutionary must possess. Political Commissar Wu Xiuchang of a certain regiment said: As the revolutionary situation continues to develop, the ideological transformation of every revolutionary, especially of regimental and above leaders, is increasingly demanding higher standards. No matter how great our achievements in ideological transformation, we must realize that our ideological level is still far from fully conforming to Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao calls on us to turn the army into a revolutionary school, which sets even higher standards for our ideological transformation.

To transform the subjective world, one must first correctly recognize the subjective world. Political Commissar Zhu Guangxing of a certain artillery regiment said: The main reason we do not feel urgent about ideological transformation is that we cannot correctly recognize ourselves and cannot sensitively discover our problems. He said: To strengthen self-transformation, we have put forward the requirement for the regimental party committee members to continuously re-recognize the situation and re-recognize themselves. I often have the feeling that looking back, there seem to be no problems, but looking forward, the problems are huge; using low standards, there seem to be no problems, but using high standards, there are many problems. In the past, I always thought that after twenty years of revolutionary tempering and being an active participant in various political movements, my class stance was without problems. However, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I lacked understanding of some issues. In the past, watching some poisonous films, I found some problems in the films, but I did not use class analysis to expose these bad films as poisonous weeds, so I could not defend Mao Zedong Thought like Liu Yingjun. What seemed to be no problem in the past, in the sharp and complex class struggle situation, in the Cultural Revolution that touches people's souls, the problems are exposed.

Everyone pointed out that in the latter half of one's revolutionary life, to maintain one's integrity, one must have higher standards than in the first half of one's revolutionary life. This is the requirement of the socialist revolution for us, and the requirement of the class struggle situation for us. Whether one can maintain high standards in ideological transformation and dare to demand of oneself at all times, in all places, and in all matters with Mao Zedong Thought, fundamentally, is a matter of class struggle awareness. Liu Yingjun became a great communist warrior precisely because he had a clear class struggle awareness. He not only saw that there are still class enemies in the objective world but also saw that there are "class enemies" in his subjective world. Political Commissar Zhang Naizhi deeply felt that: Chairman Mao teaches us that during the entire period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the question of who will defeat whom in the ideological realm between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat has not been resolved. Since there are classes and class struggles in society, various non-proletarian thoughts will inevitably be reflected in our minds. Whether one admits or not that there is "enemy" in one's mind is a manifestation of whether one's class struggle awareness is strong or not, and it is the ideological foundation of self-revolution. Learning from Liu Yingjun means to be like him, to have a strong class struggle awareness, to consciously carry out the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology in one's mind, to use high standards to find problems, to not conceal problems, to continuously revolutionize, to thoroughly revolutionize, to revolutionize to the end, and to advance forever.

Using an Active Attitude to Carry Out the Struggle

Everyone believes that correctly recognizing one's subjective world and using high standards to view one's flaws is only the starting point for solving problems. To truly solve problems, one must take a high attitude and launch a struggle. Liu Yingjun was able to establish a proletarian worldview precisely because he dared to firmly and repeatedly struggle against the non-proletarian thoughts in his mind. Some leaders' ideological transformation is not as thorough as Liu Yingjun's, often because they are somewhat indulgent and compromising towards their ideological problems, adopting a liberal attitude. Everyone said: As a proletarian revolutionary warrior, especially a regimental and above leader, one must not coexist with personalism but must launch a resolute attack against it.

How can one actively attack personalist thoughts? Regimental Commander Liu Tianchang and Political Commissar Liu Xinzeng shared their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to transform their thinking. They said: Once personalism and all non-proletarian thoughts are detected, they must be firmly struggled against, repeatedly struggled against, without any indulgence or compromise. They used their personal experiences to illustrate that Mao Zedong Thought is the philosophy of struggle, the philosophy of revolution, and the philosophy of criticism. Only by firmly struggling against various non-proletarian thoughts in one's mind can they be thoroughly eliminated.

Everyone, in exchanging their experiences in ideological revolutionization, pointed out: Is ideological transformation a passive defense or an active attack? Is it a low attitude or a high attitude? This is actually a matter of attitude towards bourgeois ideology. To struggle fiercely against bourgeois ideology, one must first hate it deeply. Regimental Commander Ma Chaoheng said: The new characteristics of the current class struggle situation are the struggle between the enemy's "peaceful evolution" and our countering "peaceful evolution." Bourgeois ideology is the enemy in our minds. If we do not solve the problem of hating bourgeois ideology, we cannot transform our thinking. In the past, in battles, seeing the enemy made one's eyes red, and one could not eat or sleep without eliminating the enemy. One hated the armed class enemies to the bone; now, towards the ideological class enemies, especially the personalism in one's mind, one knows it is rotten, but one does not hate it as deeply as one hates the armed enemies, so one is afraid of itching and afraid of pain, afraid of poking the "bee nest" in one's thinking. In the future, one must first solve this problem of "hate." If one does not "hate" personalism, one's attitude towards ideological transformation cannot be raised. Everyone said: Only by following the instructions of the Party Central Committee, by never forgetting class struggle, never forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forgetting to emphasize politics, and never forgetting to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, can one achieve victory in ideological transformation by fighting to the death, struggling resolutely, and achieving continuous victories. Speed Up the Transformation of Worldview

Everyone also pointed out: In the face of the sharp and complex class struggle situation at home and abroad, ideological transformation must not only maintain high standards and high attitudes but must also be carried out urgently. Chairman Mao said: "So many things, always urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, we strive for every moment." Liu Yingjun, despite his short time in the army and short time studying Chairman Mao's works, became a great communist warrior precisely because he had the revolutionary spirit of striving for every moment. Some leaders think that ideological revolutionization is a lifelong task, and thoroughly transforming one's worldview is a long-term task that can be done slowly. This "slowly" mentality makes ideological transformation unable to achieve immediate results.

Political Commissar Yang Zhonghe said: Chairman Mao teaches us that the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation. Ideological transformation is a long-term task, but we cannot use the long-term nature as an excuse to relax our ideological transformation. Ideological transformation has a process, but by exerting subjective initiative, one can shorten this process. He felt from his several months of practical tempering in the company that: As long as one is determined to thoroughly break with old thoughts and old styles, as long as one's ideological transformation has a high degree of self-awareness and urgency, as long as one dares to temper oneself in practice and transform oneself among the masses, there will be no "tail" that cannot be cut off, and there will be no "old difficult" problems that cannot be solved.

Where does the self-awareness of ideological transformation come from? Everyone, taking Liu Yingjun as an example, believes that in thinking, one must solve three problems: First, remember Chairman Mao's teaching that one must never forget class struggle, grasp class struggle, grasp ideological transformation, oppose the enemy's "peaceful evolution" plot, and ensure that the Party and the country will never change color. Second, often think about our lofty duty to struggle for communism, to speed up the realization of ideological revolutionization, and to be a thorough revolutionary. Third, do not forget that one is responsible for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Everyone expressed: To bury imperialism as soon as possible and realize communism, we must take Liu Yingjun as an example, take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, take the lead in thoroughly self-revolutionizing, promote officers and soldiers to better realize ideological revolutionization, and turn the army into a great school for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

### 谁掌握了毛泽东思想，就应该向谁学习

    谁掌握了毛泽东思想，就应该向谁学习
    解放军南京部队某部团以上干部学习刘英俊座谈纪要
    人民解放军南京部队某部团以上干部，在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，以刘英俊为榜样，对照检查自己，畅谈改造思想的体会。他们满怀革命激情表示，不管职位高低，资历深浅，谁掌握了毛泽东思想，就应该向谁学习。他们认为，刘英俊的一生，是自己后半辈子怎样革命的样板。要像毛泽东时代的革命小将那样改造好世界观，必须树立高标准高姿态的思想。
    用高标准看待缺点
    大家认为，要像刘英俊那样具有彻底的自我革命精神，首先必须用高标准来看待自己的思想改造。刘英俊改造思想不满足于一般地解决思想问题，而是要求自己的所思所想、一言一行都要完全符合毛泽东思想。他经常用毛主席是怎样讲的，自己是怎样想的，怎样做的，今后应当怎样做，来严格检查自己，甚至在做了好事之后，还要对照毛主席的教导，进行自我批评。他这种改造思想坚持高标准的精神，是一个彻底革命者必须具备的。某团政委武绪昌说：随着革命形势的不断发展，对每一个革命者，特别是团以上领导干部的思想改造，越来越提出更高的要求。我们的思想改造无论取得多大成绩，都要想到我们的思想水平距离完全符合毛泽东思想，还差得很远很远。毛主席号召我们要把部队办成革命化的大学校，这就对我们思想改造提出了更高的要求。
    要改造主观世界，首先必须正确认识主观世界。某炮团政委朱广兴说：我们在思想改造上不感到那么迫切，主要原因就是不能正确认识自己，不能锐敏地发现自己的问题。他说：为了加强自我改造，我们对团党委成员提出不断重新认识形势、重新认识自己的要求。我自己就常有这样的感觉，向后看好像没有什么问题，往前看问题就很大；用低标准来看好像没有什么问题，用高标准来看，问题多得很。过去总认为，经过一二十年的革命锻炼，在历次政治运动中都是积极分子，阶级立场是没有什么问题的了。可是在无产阶级文化大革命中，对一些问题就认识不足。过去看了一些毒草影片，也发现影片中有些问题，但没有用阶级分析方法，识破这些坏影片就是毒草，所以，不能够像刘英俊那样，勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想。过去看起来没有问题，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争形势下，在触及人们灵魂的文化大革命中，问题就暴露出来了。
    大家指出，领导干部在后半辈子革命中，要保持晚节，必须比前半辈子革命标准更高，这是社会主义革命对我们的要求，阶级斗争形势对我们的要求。在改造思想上能不能坚持高标准，敢不敢时时、处处、事事用毛泽东思想来要求自己，根本上是一个阶级斗争观念问题。刘英俊所以成为伟大的共产主义战士，就是因为他有鲜明的阶级斗争观念。他不仅看到客观世界上还有阶级敌人，同时也看到自己主观世界里也有“阶级敌人”。某团政委张乃枝深有体会地说：毛主席教导我们，在整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，资产阶级和无产阶级在意识形态上谁战胜谁的问题，还没有解决。社会上有阶级和阶级斗争，各种非无产阶级思想就必然会反映到我们头脑里来。承认不承认自己脑子里有“敌情”，是阶级斗争观念强不强的表现，是自觉革命的思想基础。学习刘英俊，就是要像他那样，有坚强的阶级斗争观念，自觉地在头脑中开展灭资兴无的斗争，用高标准找问题，有问题不掩饰，不断革命，彻底革命，革命到底，永远前进。
    用积极态度开展斗争
    大家认为，正确认识自己的主观世界，用高标准看待自己的缺点，这仅仅是解决问题的起点，要真正解决问题，还必须高姿态展开斗争。刘英俊所以能树立了无产阶级世界观，是敢于同自己头脑中的非无产阶级思想坚决斗争反复斗争的结果。有些领导干部改造思想不如刘英俊彻底，往往就是由于对自己的思想问题，有点迁就、妥协，抱着自由主义的态度。大家说：作为一个无产阶级的革命战士，特别是团以上领导干部，决不能与个人主义和平共处，应该坚决向它进攻。
    怎样才能向个人主义思想积极进攻呢？某团团长刘天昌和政委刘新增谈了他们党委活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想的体会。他们说：对个人主义和一切非无产阶级思想一经察觉，就必须坚决斗争，反复斗争，毫不迁就妥协。他们用自己亲身的经历说明，毛泽东思想就是斗争的哲学，革命的哲学，批判的哲学。对于自己头脑中各种非无产阶级思想，只有坚决斗争，才能彻底破除。
    大家在交流思想革命化的体会中指出：改造思想是消极防御还是积极进攻？是低姿态还是高姿态？这实际上是对资产阶级思想的态度问题。对资产阶级思想斗得要狠，首先要对它恨得深。团长马朝珩说：现阶段阶级斗争形势的新特点是敌人搞“和平演变”和我们的反“和平演变”的斗争。资产阶级思想就是我们头脑中的敌人，不解决对资产阶级思想恨的问题，就改造不好思想，过去在战斗中，见到敌人就眼红，不消灭敌人就吃不下饭，睡不好觉，对拿枪的阶级敌人是恨之入骨的；现在对意识形态上的阶级敌人，特别是头脑中的个人主义，也知道是臭的，但就不如对拿枪的敌人恨得深，所以怕痒怕疼，怕戳思想上的“蚂蜂窝”。今后首先要解决这个“恨”字的问题，对个人主义不“恨”，改造思想的姿态就高不起来。大家都说：只有遵照党中央的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，才能在思想改造上刺刀见红，坚决斗争，不断取得胜利。加紧改造世界观
    大家又指出：在国内外阶级斗争尖锐复杂的形势面前，改造思想不仅要坚持高标准高姿态，还应该加紧进行。毛主席说：“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”刘英俊入伍时间不长，学习毛主席著作的时间不长，却成为伟大的共产主义战士，他就是有只争朝夕的革命精神。某些领导干部认为思想革命化是一辈子的事情，彻底改造世界观是长期的任务，可以慢慢来。这种“慢慢来”的思想，使得思想改造不能收到立竿见影的效果。
    团政委杨忠和说：毛主席教导我们，世界观的转变是一个根本的转变。改造思想是一项长期的任务，但是，我们不能借口长期性而放松自己的思想改造。改造思想要有一个过程，但是发挥主观能动性就可以缩短这个过程。他从自己深入连队几个月的实际锻炼中体会到：只要自己决心和旧思想旧作风彻底决裂，只要自己改造思想有高度的自觉性和迫切感，只要敢于到实践中去锻炼，到群众中去改造，就没有割不掉的“尾巴”，就没有解决不了的“老大难”问题。
    改造思想的自觉性从哪里来呢？大家以刘英俊为榜样，认为思想上必须解决三个问题：一是牢记毛主席千万不要忘记阶级斗争的教导，抓阶级斗争，抓思想改造，反对阶级敌人的“和平演变”阴谋，保证党和国家永不变色。二是经常想一想，我们为共产主义奋斗的崇高职责，要加紧实现思想革命化，当好彻底革命派。三是不要忘记自己担负着培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的重担。
    大家表示：为了早日埋葬帝国主义，实现共产主义，我们一定以刘英俊为榜样，带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头彻底自我革命，推动干部战士更好实现思想革命化，把部队办成活学活用毛主席著作的大学校。
