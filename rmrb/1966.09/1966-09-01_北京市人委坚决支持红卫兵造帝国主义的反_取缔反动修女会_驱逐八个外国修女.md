Beijing Municipal People's Committee Resolutely Supports Red Guards in Opposing Imperialism
Dissolves Reactionary Nunnery and Expels Eight Foreign Nuns

New China News Agency, August 31st

The Beijing Municipal People's Committee, in response to the demands of the capital's Red Guards and the broad revolutionary masses, has decided to safeguard our country's security and the people's interests. On August 26th, it announced the dissolution of the Maria Francis Nunnery and took over the Saint Heart School run by this nunnery. On August 28th, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an expulsion order, expelling eight foreign nuns, including Fedorov, who were engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. Under the escort of our public security personnel and Red Guards, they were driven out of the country on August 31st.

The Maria Francis Nunnery was established in 1915 under the instructions of the Roman headquarters, accompanying the imperialist invasion of the Chinese people. Before liberation, this nunnery colluded with domestic and foreign reactionary ruling classes, consistently opposing our people and sabotaging the Chinese people's liberation cause. After liberation, under the command of the Roman headquarters, this nunnery, disguised as a religious organization and using education as a cover, has been secretly colluding with some counter-revolutionary elements within the Catholic Church in Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Harbin. They have been spying on our country, printing reactionary documents, manufacturing and spreading rumors, inciting counter-revolutionary elements to plot disturbances, and conducting a series of serious espionage and sabotage activities that harm our country's sovereignty.

In this unprecedented, magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. With the force of a landslide and the power of thunder, they have swept away the imperialist and revisionist reactionary forces. They will no longer allow the counter-revolutionary nunnery, which serves imperialism, to commit crimes on our soil. On August 24th, Red Guards from more than ten schools, including Beijing Anti-Imperialist University Affiliated Middle School (formerly the 21st Middle School), Beijing Girls' Twelfth Middle School, Beijing Red Flag School, and Beijing Red University Affiliated Middle School (formerly Girls' First Middle School), rose up to oppose the counter-revolutionary nunnery. This revolutionary action immediately received the most resolute and enthusiastic support from the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals.

On August 26th, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee accepted the resolute demands of the Red Guards and the broad revolutionary masses. At a mass rally, it announced the order to dissolve the Maria Francis Nunnery and take over the Saint Heart School, which was warmly supported by the Red Guards and the broad revolutionary masses. Representatives of the Red Guards spoke at the meeting, angrily exposing the crimes committed by this nunnery and resolutely supporting the decision of the Municipal People's Committee. On the evening of August 28th, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau announced at a mass rally the expulsion of eight foreign nuns, including Fedorov, who were engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, and immediately carried out the order. That night, the masses gathered inside and outside the nunnery were in high spirits. Many representatives of the Red Guards, revolutionary masses, and victims who had been oppressed and persecuted by the reactionary nunnery spoke at the meeting, denouncing and condemning the crimes of this nunnery, and expressing their enthusiastic support for the expulsion order announced by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau. The attendees shouted: "Down with American imperialism!" "Counter-revolutionary foreign nuns get out!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

    北京市人委坚决支持红卫兵造帝国主义的反
    取缔反动修女会　驱逐八个外国修女
    新华社三十一日讯  北京市人民委员会接受首都红卫兵和广大革命群众的要求，为保卫我国的安全和人民的利益，于八月二十六日宣布取缔玛利亚方济格修女会，并接管这个修女会所办的圣心学校。北京市公安局在八月二十八日宣布驱逐令，把从事反革命活动的费多罗维等八名外国修女驱逐出境。在我公安人员和红卫兵的押送下，她们已于八月三十一日被我赶出国境。
    玛利亚方济格修女会是在一九一五年伴随着帝国主义对中国人民的侵略，受罗马总会指示设立的。解放前，这个修女会与国内外反动统治阶级相勾结，狼狈为奸，一贯敌视我国人民，破坏中国人民的解放事业。解放后，这个修女会在罗马总会的指挥下，披着宗教外衣，借办学为掩护，一直同北京、河北、山西、内蒙古和哈尔滨等地天主教内的一些反革命分子秘密勾结，刺探我国情报，印发反动文件，制造和传播谣言，煽动反革命分子阴谋骚乱，进行了一系列严重危害我国主权的特务破坏活动。
    在这次轰轰烈烈的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的红卫兵小将们，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，摧枯拉朽，横扫帝国主义和修正主义的反动势力。他们再也不允许为帝国主义服务的反革命修女会在我国领土上为非作歹。八月二十四日，北京抗大一附中（原二十一中）、北京女十二中、北京红旗学校、北京红大一附中（原女一中）等十多个学校的红卫兵，起来造反革命修女会的反。他们这一革命行动，立即得到广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子的最坚决最热烈的拥护和支持。
    八月二十六日，北京市人民委员会接受红卫兵小将们和广大革命群众的坚决要求，在群众集会上宣布了取缔玛利亚方济格修女会并接管圣心学校的命令，受到了红卫兵和广大革命群众的热烈拥护。红卫兵的代表们，在会上纷纷发言，愤怒揭发这个修女会所犯的罪行，坚决拥护市人委的决定。八月二十八日晚，北京市公安局在群众集会上，宣布驱逐从事反革命活动的费多罗维等八名外国修女出境，立即执行。当夜聚集在修女会院内外的群众，群情激昂，许多红卫兵的代表和革命群众以及被反动修女会摧残、压迫的受害者，在大会上争先发言，控诉和声讨这个修女会的罪行，并表示热烈拥护北京市公安局宣布的驱逐令。到会群众高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“反革命外国修女滚蛋！”“无产阶级专政万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
