In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers and peasants and revolutionary students in our country share a common goal and a unified revolutionary direction. We should breathe together, share a common destiny, and under the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought, inspire, learn from, support, and rely on each other to strive for the great victory of the Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Mao Zedong's "Sixteen Points" clearly states: "To prevent the shifting of the main target of the struggle, no one is allowed, under any pretext, to incite the masses to fight the masses, or students to fight students."

This regulation by the Central Committee has clarified the direction of the struggle, boosted the morale of the masses, strengthened the unity among workers and peasants, among revolutionary students, between workers and peasants and revolutionary students, and among all revolutionary comrades, and has made the tide of the Cultural Revolution surge forward across the country.

However, some leaders in certain places and units have directly violated this regulation of the Central Committee. They have found various excuses to suppress the mass movement. They have even incited some workers and peasants who do not understand the truth to oppose revolutionary students and create a confrontation with them. What they are doing is completely against Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, a wrong direction, and a wrong line.

We workers and peasants must keep our eyes open and be vigilant. We must not allow anyone, under any pretext or in any form, to incite workers and peasants to fight students.

Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, we workers and peasants have undergone long-term arduous revolutionary struggles and have deep class feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao, for Mao Zedong Thought, for the Party, and for the socialist cause. We will not allow anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, who opposes Mao Zedong Thought, who opposes the Party, who opposes socialism. We will definitely stand up and fight against them. However, we will also not allow anyone to use our deep class feelings for the Party to stir up trouble and create a confrontation between us and revolutionary students, allowing them to take advantage of the situation.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, students have risen up to make a revolution, directing the spearhead of their struggle against those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and against all monsters and demons. Their general direction has never been wrong. This is the mainstream of the movement. We workers and peasants should warmly welcome their revolutionary actions and firmly support them. It is inevitable that some students will have shortcomings in their struggle. We should believe that the vast majority of students want revolution and will educate themselves. Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, they will definitely learn to swim while swimming and learn to fight while fighting. We must not see only their shortcomings and easily believe in someone's incitement to interfere with their revolutionary actions.

In the struggle, workers and peasants and revolutionary students may have different views and opinions on certain issues, which is a completely normal phenomenon. The question is how to resolve these contradictions. The correct attitude should be to follow Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, use the "Sixteen Points" as the standard for judging right and wrong, and use the formula of unity-criticism-unity to resolve them through appropriate channels. We must not interfere with each other as soon as there are different opinions, creating a confrontation.

We workers and peasants must unite with revolutionary students, and all revolutionary comrades must unite. We must resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions. We must model ourselves on the "Sixteen Points" and ensure that the Cultural Revolution advances victoriously along the track of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 工农群众和革命学生在毛泽东思想旗帜下团结起来

    工农群众和革命学生在毛泽东思想旗帜下团结起来
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国广大的工农群众和革命学生，斗争目标是共同的，革命大方向是一致的。我们应当同呼吸，共命运，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，互相鼓舞，互相学习，互相支持，互相信赖，争取文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    毛泽东同志主持制定的十六条，明确指出：“为了防止转移斗争的主要目标，不许用任何借口，去挑动群众斗争群众，挑动学生斗争学生”。
    中央这个规定，明确了斗争的方向，鼓舞了群众的斗志，加强了工农群众之间、革命学生之间、工农群众和革命学生之间、以及一切革命同志之间的团结，使文化革命的浪潮在全国范围内汹涌澎湃地向前发展。
    但是，有些地方、有些单位的负责人，却直接违背了中央这个规定。他们找出种种借口，压制群众运动。他们甚至挑动一部分不明真相的工人农民，来反对革命学生，同革命学生闹对立。他们这样做，是完全违背毛泽东同志指示的，是方向的错误，路线的错误。
    我们工人农民，要擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，决不允许任何人，以任何借口，用任何形式，来挑动工农斗争学生。
    我们工农群众，在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导下，经过长期艰苦的革命斗争锻炼，对我们伟大领袖毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对党，对社会主义事业抱有深厚的阶级感情。谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，谁反对党，谁反对社会主义，我们是决不允许的，一定要坚决起来斗争的。但是，我们也决不允许任何人利用我们工人农民对党的深厚的阶级感情，播弄是非，制造我们同革命学生的对立，让他们从中钻空子。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，学生起来闹革命，把斗争的矛头指向党内走资本主义道路的当权派，指向一切牛鬼蛇神。他们的大方向始终没有错。这是运动的主流。我们工人农民，应当热烈欢迎他们的革命行动，坚决支持他们的革命行动。革命学生在斗争中出现一些缺点，是难免的。我们应当相信，绝大多数学生是要革命的，是会自己教育自己的。他们在毛泽东思想阳光的照耀下，一定能够在游泳中学会游泳，在斗争中学会斗争。我们决不要只看到他们一些缺点，就轻信某些人的挑动，去干预他们的革命行动。
    在斗争中，工农群众和革命学生，对某些问题，有不同的看法，不同的意见，这是完全正常的现象。问题是有了矛盾怎样来解决。正确的态度应当是，按照毛泽东同志的教导，以十六条作为判断是非的标准，运用团结——批评——团结的公式，经过适当的途径，协商解决。决不要一有不同意见，就去干预对方，造成对立。
    我们工人农民一定要和革命学生团结起来，一切革命同志要团结起来，坚决听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，模范地贯彻执行十六条，使文化大革命沿着毛泽东思想的轨道胜利前进。
