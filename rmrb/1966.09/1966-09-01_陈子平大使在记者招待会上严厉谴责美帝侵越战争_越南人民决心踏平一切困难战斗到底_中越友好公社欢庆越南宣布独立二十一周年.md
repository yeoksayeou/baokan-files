On the eve of the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ambassador Chen Ziping of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China held a press conference this afternoon.

Ambassador Chen Ziping strongly condemned the U.S. imperialist aggression against the Vietnamese people. He said that in the current struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, the Vietnamese people have achieved tremendous victories. In the face of the Vietnamese people's iron will and indomitable spirit, U.S. imperialism has suffered a crushing defeat.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call on July 17 expressed the determination of the Vietnamese people: To defeat the U.S. aggressors, we are determined to endure all hardships, overcome all difficulties, and fight to the end. We will not stop until there is not a single U.S. aggressor left on our soil.

The ambassador said that the Vietnamese people's position is clear and consistent, which is the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The Vietnamese people would rather die than be slaves, and would rather die than give up their sacred national rights.

Ambassador Chen Ziping said that the support and aid from the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people are filled with the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The Chinese people, the Chinese government, and the Communist Party of China have always provided immense and precious sympathy, support, and aid to the Vietnamese people. When mentioning the recent agreement signed by the two governments, "Agreement on Economic and Technical Assistance from China to Vietnam," the ambassador said that the Chinese government has provided all the necessary aid that Vietnam has requested. He expressed that with their own fighting spirit and the sympathy, support, and aid from people all over the world, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory.

According to Xinhua News Agency, tonight, members of the Beijing-Zhongyue Friendship People's Commune, together with the delegation of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association led by Sun Guangfu, celebrated the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Sun Guangfu spoke at the celebration, warmly congratulating the growing friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples and wishing Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the Chinese people, good health. Ambassador Chen Ziping of Vietnam to China, who was invited to attend the celebration, also spoke at the meeting. He praised the seven hundred million Chinese people who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China. He said that this cultural revolution will sweep away the remnants of feudalism and capitalism, pushing the socialist revolution in China to a new stage. He said that the Vietnamese people are moving the mountain of U.S. imperialism with the spirit of "Moving Mountains" proposed by Chairman Mao. He said that the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism is not to be feared, and the Vietnamese people have the determination to move this mountain. Our basis is as Chairman Mao said, "The people, only the people, are the motive force in the making of world history." The Vietnamese people will surely achieve final victory through people's war.

Members of the delegation, including Hai Phong City militia member, advanced worker Cao Thi Lan, and Vietnamese People's Army hero Nguyen Van Thang, also spoke at the meeting.

A responsible person from the commune spoke at the meeting, expressing high respect to the heroic Vietnamese people who are standing at the forefront of the anti-U.S. struggle, and expressing the most resolute support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation.

    陈子平大使说，七月十七日胡志明主席的号召书表达了越南人民的决心：为了战胜美国强盗，决心忍受一切艰苦，踏平各种困难，坚决战斗到底，一定要打到在我们国土上不剩一个美国侵略者时才罢休。
    大使说，越南人民的立场是鲜明的、一贯的，那就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。越南人民宁死不做奴隶，宁死也不放弃自己神圣的民族权利。
    陈子平大使说，中国人民对越南人民的支持和援助，充满着无产阶级国际主义的精神。中国人民、中国政府和中国共产党始终把无比巨大和珍贵的同情、支持和援助给予越南人民。大使提到越中两国政府最近签订的“关于中国给予越南经济技术援助的协定”时说，中国政府已向越南人民提供了越南所要求的一切必要的援助。他表示，越南人民有了自己战斗的决心，又有全世界人民的同情、支持和援助，越南人民必将取得最后胜利。
