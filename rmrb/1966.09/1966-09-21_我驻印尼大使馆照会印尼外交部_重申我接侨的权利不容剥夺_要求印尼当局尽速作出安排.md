	Chinese Embassy in Indonesia Communicates with Indonesian Foreign Ministry:
	Reiterating the Right to Receive Overseas Chinese Cannot Be Stripped Away,
	Requiring Indonesian Authorities to Make Arrangements Immediately

	New China News Agency, September 20th: Jakarta News: On the 17th, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia communicated with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry regarding the Indonesian government's unreasonable restrictions on the Chinese government's dispatch of personnel to Medan to handle the repatriation of affected overseas Chinese.

	The communication stated: On September 17th, the Deputy Director of the Asia-Pacific Department of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, Masuni, replied to the Chinese Consul-General in Jakarta, Xu Ren, that Indonesia could only agree to the Chinese government sending Vice Consul Kwok Suk-ming alone to Medan to handle the repatriation of affected overseas Chinese, and could not agree to other consular officials and necessary staff going to Medan. The Indonesian government's attitude is unreasonable, and the Chinese Embassy expresses regret over this.

	The communication stated: It must be pointed out that the five demands proposed by the Chinese government in its communication on September 5th regarding the dispatch of ships to Medan to receive overseas Chinese are completely reasonable. The Chinese government's decision to send Consul-General Xu Ren and others to Medan to handle the repatriation of affected overseas Chinese and to take care of Chinese ships is an inalienable and legitimate right. The Indonesian government has an unshirkable responsibility to immediately give a satisfactory response to the aforementioned demands of the Chinese government.

	The communication stated: Given that the first Chinese ship to receive overseas Chinese has already set sail and is on its way to Medan, the organizational arrangements for transporting affected overseas Chinese are urgent. As an emergency measure, the Chinese Embassy has decided to first send Vice Consul Kwok Suk-ming and interpreter Liu Xin-sheng to fly to Medan immediately, and requires the Indonesian government to guarantee their safety and provide all necessary conveniences.

	The communication finally stated: Due to the large number of affected overseas Chinese being forced to Medan by the Indonesian government, the task of receiving overseas Chinese is very heavy. The Chinese government believes that sending Consul-General Xu Ren and others to work there is still very necessary. The Embassy requires the Indonesian government to make arrangements for this as soon as possible.

    我驻印尼大使馆照会印尼外交部
    重申我接侨的权利不容剥夺  要求印尼当局尽速作出安排
    新华社二十日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十七日就印度尼西亚政府无理限制中国政府派人前往棉兰办理受害华侨返国事宜，照会印度尼西亚外交部。
    照会说：九月十七日，印度尼西亚外交部亚洲太平洋司马佐尼副司长答复中国驻雅加达总领事徐仁，印度尼西亚只能同意中国政府派副领事邝叔明一人前往棉兰办理受害华侨返国事宜，不能同意其他领事官员和必要的工作人员前往棉兰。印度尼西亚政府这种态度是没有任何道理的，中国大使馆对此表示遗憾。
    照会说：必须指出，中国政府在九月五日的照会中，就派船前往棉兰接侨所提出的五项要求，是完全合情合理的，中国政府决定派驻雅加达总领事徐仁等人前往棉兰办理受害华侨返国事宜，并照料中国船只，更是不容剥夺的正当权利。印度尼西亚政府负有不可推卸的责任，对中国政府的上述要求立即作出圆满的答复。
    照会说：鉴于中国第一艘接侨船只已经启航前来棉兰途中，接运受害华侨的组织安排工作刻不容缓，作为紧急步骤，中国大使馆决定先派副领事邝叔明偕同译员刘新生立即乘飞机前往棉兰，要求印度尼西亚政府，切实保证他们的安全和提供一切方便。
    照会最后说：由于大批受害华侨被印度尼西亚政府赶到棉兰，接侨任务十分繁重，中国政府认为，派徐仁总领事等人前往工作仍然是十分必要的。大使馆要求印度尼西亚政府对此尽速作出安排。
