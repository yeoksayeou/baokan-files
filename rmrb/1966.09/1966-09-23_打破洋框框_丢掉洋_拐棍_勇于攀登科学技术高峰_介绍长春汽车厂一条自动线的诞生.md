The rear axle workshop of the Changchun Automobile Chassis Factory has an axle sleeve production line designed by foreign experts. The machines installed on this line are bulky and clumsy. Workers have to lift and move steel tubes weighing tens of kilograms, flipping them over and over, hundreds of times a day, making the work extremely labor-intensive. Could machines replace manual operations? Workers desperately hoped to transform it into an automated line!

In the past, workers had shared their idea of creating an automated line with the foreign experts then working in the factory. These experts sneered, saying: "Reforming equipment is not your job. Your task is to learn how to operate the machines and meet production quotas."

Later, the foreign experts left. Could it be that we workers really couldn't reform the equipment and forge our own path? No! With Mao Zedong Thought, workers can do anything.

In 1965, the automobile factory launched a widespread campaign to study Chairman Mao's works. Workers read Mao's books and understood many truths. They realized that knowledge comes from practice, that "those who truly know are those who practice in the world"; and that the revolution in industrial production relies on the working class itself. Thus, they formed a strike team, primarily composed of workers with the participation of workshop technicians, to build the automated axle sleeve production line. Their actions received active support from the factory's Party Committee and administrative leadership.

After more than a month of hard work, the strike team used a horizontal transfer feeding device to connect several machines into a production line. However, the structure was rough, and the performance was not stable.

The workers said, "We must be thorough revolutionaries in technological innovation. What we create should be advanced and high-standard automated lines. The purpose of automation is not just to reduce physical labor but also to boost the morale of the Chinese people. Whatever the imperialists and revisionists have, we must have; whatever they don't have, we must also have. Automation is a class struggle, a struggle against imperialism and revisionism on the industrial front."

To make a revolution, one should not fear failure. Failure can be turned into success. Chairman Mao said: "After experiencing failure, people also learn from it, correct their thoughts to conform to the laws of the external world, and thus turn failure into success." Chairman Mao's words made the workers' hearts burn brighter, and they were determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions and scale the heights of scientific and technological progress.

They carefully summarized the experiences of the previous period, redrafted the plan, and after repeated discussions and modifications, finally finalized the design. They hung a plaque with Chairman Mao's quotations on the machine. They proposed to eliminate the fear and establish the courage, relying on Mao Zedong Thought to walk the path of industrialization.

After more than two months and fourteen trials and modifications, they finally created an automated axle sleeve production line that included four sets of innovative rotating mechanical arms and a reciprocating rotating feeding machine. This automated line is simple in structure, sensitive in operation, coordinated in action, takes up little space, and has high production efficiency.

When the automated line was tested, the workers pressed a button, and rows of steel tubes rolled in from one end of the automated line, jumping, flipping, and rolling on the conveyor belt. In just over a minute, it completed forty-eight complex actions and then output polished axle sleeves from the other end of the automated line to the next process.

This event greatly diminished the arrogance of foreign experts and boosted the morale of Chinese workers, earning enthusiastic praise from visitors. Why were the technical barriers that many foreign "experts" and "authorities" couldn't overcome now conquered by a few young workers? Actually, this question is not difficult to understand. The workers who created this automated line said well: The key to achieving results in technological revolution is the revolutionization of people's thoughts. Once the working class is armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it will become the wisest, bravest, and most creative, able to achieve scientific and technological achievements that foreign "experts" and all bourgeois "authorities" can only dream of.

    打破洋框框　丢掉洋“拐棍”
    勇于攀登科学技术高峰
    ——介绍长春汽车厂一条自动线的诞生
    长春汽车底盘厂后桥车间，有一条外国专家设计的半轴套管生产线。安置在这条线上的机器，又粗又笨。工人干活时，要把十几公斤重的钢管，搬上搬下，翻过来倒过去，一天摆弄几百次，劳动量很大。能不能用机器来代替手工操作呢？工人们多么希望把它改成一条自动线啊！
    过去，工人们曾经把搞自动线的想法告诉了当时在厂里的外国专家。这些专家却讽刺地说：改革设备不是你们工人的事，你们的任务是学会掌握机器，生产达到定额。
    后来外国专家走了，难道我们工人同志们真的不能改革设备，走自己的路吗？能！有了毛泽东思想，工人们什么都能做。
    一九六五年，汽车厂里广泛地掀起了学习毛主席著作的热潮。工人们读了毛主席的书，明白了许多真理。他们懂得了知识产生于实践，“真正亲知的是天下实践着的人”；工业生产的革命要靠工人阶级自己。于是，他们组成了以工人为主有车间技术员参加的半轴套管自动线突击队，决心自己动手把生产自动线搞起来。他们的行动得到工厂党委和行政领导的积极支持。
    突击队经过一个多月的苦战，用平移式送料装置，把原来的几台机器联结成了一条生产线。但是结构粗糙，效能也不够稳定。
    工人们说，我们搞技术革新也要当彻底的革命派，我们要创造的，应该是先进的、高标准的自动线。搞自动线决不单是为了减轻体力劳动，也是为了长中国人民的志气。帝国主义和修正主义有的，我们一定要有，他们没有的我们也一定要有。搞自动化是阶级斗争，是在工业战线上的反帝、反修斗争。
    搞革命就不怕失败，失败了再来。毛主席说：“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利。”毛主席的话使工人的心更红眼更亮了，大家决心要按着毛主席的指示，攀登科学技术的高峰。
    他们认真总结了前一段的经验，重新制订了方案。经过反复讨论反复修改，最后定型制造。他们把毛主席语录牌挂在机器旁。他们提出要打掉“怕”字，树立“敢”字，依靠毛泽东思想，走自己工业化的道路。
    他们用了两个多月时间，经过十四次试验和修改，终于独创出了包括四套新颖的回转机械手，和一台往复回转送料机等装置的半轴套管生产自动线。这条自动线结构简易，操作灵敏，动作协调，占地很少，生产效率很高。
    当自动线试车的时候，工人一按电钮，一排排钢管就从自动线的一端顺序滚进，在传送带上时而跳跃、时而反转、时而滚动……，只用一分多钟时间，就完成了四十八个复杂动作，然后把一个个明光铮亮的半轴套管，从自动线的那端输往下道工序。
    这件事情大灭洋专家的威风，大长中国工人阶级的志气，因此受到参观者的热烈称赞。为什么许多洋“专家”、洋“权威”攻不下的技术难关，现在竟被几个毛头青年征服了呢？其实，这个问题并不难懂得。创造这条自动线的工人同志说得好：技术革命要搞出成果，决定的因素是人的思想革命化。工人阶级一旦用毛泽东思想武装起来，就会变得最聪明、最勇敢、最富于创造性，就能创造出洋“专家”和一切资产阶级“权威”们望尘莫及的科学技术成就。
