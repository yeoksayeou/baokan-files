The Lao People's Patriotic Front Central Committee on August 29 issued a statement strongly protesting and severely condemning the Indian and Canadian representatives for using the name of the International Control Commission in Laos to engage in illegal activities and serve U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression. The statement said that any activities conducted by anyone using the name of the International Control Commission in Laos are completely illegal and invalid.

The statement pointed out that the Indian and Canadian representatives recently conducted an illegal "investigation" in Laos and fabricated a "report," repeating the same old lies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, claiming that there are "North Vietnamese troops" in Laos.

The statement said that according to the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laos issue, the International Control Commission in Laos lost all legal rights to conduct activities in Laos starting from July 30, 1965. However, the Indian and Canadian representatives deliberately continued to use the name of the International Control Commission to conduct activities. These activities are completely illegal and invalid and are an infringement on Laos' sovereignty.

The statement pointed out that the United States is intensifying its war of aggression against Laos, attempting to expand this war to the entire Indochina Peninsula, and plotting military adventures that threaten the peace of Southeast Asia and the world. The Indian and Canadian representatives drafted this "report," slandering the Lao People's Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, with the aim of helping the United States prepare public opinion to realize its plot to expand the war of aggression.

The statement pointed out that the British government on August 22 published the "report" of the Indian and Canadian representatives and arbitrarily added slanderous remarks. The statement warned the British government and pointed out that this is an encouragement of the illegal actions of the Indian and Canadian representatives, a despicable act of supporting the U.S. aggression and the plot to expand the war, and a despicable act against the Lao people.

According to Xinhua News Agency Hanoi, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on August 30 pointing out that the Indian and Canadian representatives in the International Control Commission in Laos fabricated the myth of "North Vietnamese troops interfering with and invading Laos" in the "report" they made and published by the British Foreign Office. The purpose is to attempt to divert world public opinion from the severe condemnation of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Laos. The statement pointed out that the Indian and Canadian representatives in the International Control Commission in Laos and the British Foreign Office's despicable act of covering up the facts of U.S. imperialism strengthening and expanding the war of aggression against Laos cannot deceive anyone.

    越南外交部发言人指出印加代表的谎言骗不了人
    据新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会八月二十九日发表声明强烈抗议并严厉谴责印度和加拿大代表利用老挝国际委员会的名义，在老挝进行非法活动，为美帝国主义扩大侵略战争效劳。声明说，任何人利用老挝国际委员会进行的一切活动都是完全非法和无效的。
    声明指出，印度、加拿大代表不久以前在老挝进行非法“调查”后，捏造出一个“报告”，重弹美帝国主义及其走狗的滥调，说什么“在老挝有北越军队”。
    声明说，按照一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议，从一九六五年七月三十日起，老挝国际委员会就失去了在老挝进行合法活动的一切权利。但是，印、加代表仍然蓄意利用国际委员会的名义继续活动。这些活动是完全非法的、无效的，是侵犯老挝主权的。
    声明指出，美国正在加紧进行侵略老挝的战争，妄图把这场战争扩大到整个印度支那，阴谋进行威胁东南亚和世界和平的军事冒险。印、加代表起草这个“报告”，诬蔑老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国，目的是为了帮助美国实现扩大侵略战争的阴谋进行舆论准备。
    声明指出，英国政府在八月二十二日公布了印、加代表的“报告”，并且恣意加进诬蔑的论调。声明对英国政府提出警告并指出，这是对印、加代表非法行为的鼓励，是附和美国侵略和扩大战争阴谋的卑鄙行径，是反对老挝人民的卑鄙行径。
    据新华社河内电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人八月三十日发表声明指出，老挝国际委员会中的印度、加拿大代表在它们所作的、并经英国外交部公布的一份“报告”中捏造所谓“北越军队干涉和侵略老挝”的神话，其目的是妄图转移世界舆论对美帝国主义侵略老挝的严厉谴责。声明指出，老挝国际委员会中的印度、加拿大代表和英国外交部掩盖美帝国主义加强和扩大侵略老挝战争的事实的卑鄙行径，决不能欺骗任何人。（附图片）
