	Moscow, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) — The latest issue of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) organ, *Vanguard*, carries an article titled "Millions Are Acting According to Mao Zedong Thought."

	The article states: Mao Zedong Thought, the highest development of Marxism-Leninism, is spreading throughout the world. The great truths of Mao Zedong Thought are being conveyed to the people. After discovering that it is the truth, millions of people are acting according to it.

	The article cites Chairman Mao's statement that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers as an example, pointing out that "these profound and wise words, simple yet full of meaning, are now being recited by millions of people. These words give great encouragement to the struggles of ordinary people all over the world."

	The article says: "In Australia, the reactionaries and imperialists, especially American imperialism which actually controls this country, appear to be very ferocious. But in reality, they are weak because they are enemies of the people."

	The article emphasizes: "Mao Zedong Thought is powerful because it is the truth. It is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism in our era because it has been proven completely correct in the revolutionary practice in China, in the struggles of the people in Africa, Latin America, and especially in Vietnam.

	"In the practice of the struggle against modern revisionism in the world communist movement, Mao Zedong Thought has been proven correct.

	"Mao Zedong Thought is the summation of the practice of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. It illuminates the path forward for all the people who are struggling.

	"It is invincible because, after discovering that it is the truth, millions of people are acting according to it."

    澳共（马列主义者）机关报《先锋报》发表文章指出
    千百万人正在按照毛泽东思想行动
    新华社二十日讯　墨尔本消息：最新出版的澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》第三十五期刊登题为《千百万人正在按照毛泽东思想行动》的文章。
    文章写道，毛泽东思想——马克思列宁主义的最高发展——正在世界范围内传播。毛泽东思想的伟大真理在传给人民。千百万人发现它是真理后，正在按照它行动。
    文章引证毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断为例，指出“这些意味深长而又充满智慧的朴素的话现在正被千百万人民所传诵。这些话给予全世界普通人民的斗争以巨大鼓舞。”
    文章说：“在澳大利亚，反动派和帝国主义，尤其是实际控制着这个国家的美帝国主义，看上去很凶，但是，实际上他们是虚弱的，因为他们同人民为敌。”
    文章强调说：“毛泽东思想之所以有威力，是因为它是真理。它是我们时代的马克思列宁主义的顶峰，因为它在中国革命的实践中，在非洲、拉丁美洲特别是在越南的人民斗争实践中，已经被证明是完全正确的。
    “毛泽东思想在世界共产主义运动反对现代修正主义的斗争实践中，已经被证明是正确的。
    “毛泽东思想是中国革命和世界革命实践的总结。它照亮了一切正在斗争中的人民的前进道路。
    “它之所以威力无穷，是因为千百万人在发现它是真理之后，正在按照它来行动。”
