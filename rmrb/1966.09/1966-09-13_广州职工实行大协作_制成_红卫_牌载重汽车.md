From the beginning of this year's Red May, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was being carried out more deeply, workers from over sixty factories in Guangzhou City have demonstrated the spirit of communist large-scale cooperation, seized the revolution, and promoted production. In just four months, they successfully developed a 3.5-ton "Red Guard" brand truck.

The "Red Guard" truck is 5.55 meters long, 2.25 meters wide, and 2.32 meters high, with a maximum speed of 90 kilometers per hour. Its advantages include a relatively small engine, light weight, high horsepower, fast speed, and low fuel consumption. After multiple tests, it has proven to have good performance, basically meeting the design requirements.

    广州职工实行大协作
    制成“红卫”牌载重汽车
    据新华社广州十二日电　从今年红五月开始，正当无产阶级文化大革命日益深入开展的时候，广州市六十多家工厂的职工发扬了共产主义大协作的精神，抓革命，促生产，仅仅用了四个月时间，便试制成功了一种名为“红卫”牌的三吨半载重汽车。
      “红卫”牌汽车全长五点五五米，宽二点二五米，高二点三二米，最高时速为九十公里。它的优点是：发动机比较小，重量轻，马力大，速度快，耗油量少。经过多次试用，证明性能良好，基本上达到了设计要求。
