The Indian government, disregarding repeated strong protests from the Chinese government, has increasingly colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, serving U.S. imperialism's plot to create "two Chinas." It has shamelessly accepted an invitation from the pseudo-foreign minister of the Chiang clique to send a parliamentary delegation to Taiwan to engage in anti-China activities.

According to news from the "Central News Agency" of the Chiang clique, a six-member Indian parliamentary delegation led by Trivedi stayed in Taiwan for five days and left Taipei on September 14. During their stay in Taiwan, the Indian parliamentary delegation held talks with the arch-enemy of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek, the pseudo-vice president of the Chiang clique, Yen Chia-kan, the pseudo-auditor-general, and the secretary-general of the Chiang party. Trivedi and others also issued frenzied anti-China rhetoric in Taipei, declaring that the Indian government should "restore friendly relations" with the Chiang Kai-shek group, re-establish "diplomatic ties," and join forces with the Chiang clique to "maintain peace and freedom in Asia." They also proposed establishing a "Sino-Indian (Chiang clique) Economic and Cultural Association" in India to jointly plot anti-China schemes with the Chiang clique's elements. The Indian government was urged to assist the traitor Dalai Lama in "liberating" Tibet.

These Indian parliamentarians also launched vicious attacks and slander against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Meanwhile, Trivedi also advocated in Taipei for the Indian government to change its stance at the United Nations General Assembly in late September, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique in continuing to illegally occupy the seat in the United Nations.

According to news from New Delhi, before the Indian government sent the parliamentary delegation to Taiwan, U.S. Ambassador to India Bowles incited the reactionary military regimes of India, Japan, and Indonesia to join forces in anti-China activities.

Since March of this year, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has been actively promoting the fallacies of "one China, one Taiwan" and "the status of Taiwan is yet to be determined" in Europe and the United States. The Indian government has further colluded with the Chiang clique, with frequent activities. According to reports from Indian newspapers and Chiang clique newspapers, in June, the Indian government sent Ragunath Singh, secretary of the Indian National Congress parliamentary party, and Lekhni Singh, a member of the Indian National Congress, to Taiwan twice to collude with the Chiang clique and develop trade and cultural relations between India and the Chiang clique.

Reporters from Indian newspapers such as the "Hindustan Times," "Indian Express," and "Deccan Herald" were also ordered to "collectively visit Taiwan" in May this year. At the beginning of September, the Indian government also sent Morarji, the editor-in-chief of the "Indian Express," to Taiwan for activities.

The Indian government's willingness to follow the will of U.S. imperialism and use all means to create "two Chinas," and its readiness to act as a lackey of U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism in anti-China activities, further exposes the ugly face of the Indian reactionaries. All anti-China "heroes" in the world will meet a bad end, and the Indian reactionaries will be no exception.

    甘心充当美帝走卒　猖狂进行反华活动
    印度政府同蒋匪帮加紧勾搭
    公然派遣议会代表团到台湾去策划反华阴谋
    新华社十五日讯　印度政府不顾我国政府一再强烈抗议，更加频繁地与蒋介石匪帮勾结，替美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋效劳，公然应蒋帮伪外交部长的邀请，派遣议会代表团到台湾进行反华活动。
    据蒋帮“中央社”的消息透露，以特里维迪为首的印度议会代表团六人，到台湾活动了五天，于九月十四日离开台北。印度议会代表团在台湾活动期间，曾同中国人民的死敌蒋介石、蒋帮伪副总统严家淦、伪监察院长、蒋党秘书长等蒋帮头目会谈。特里维迪等并在台北发出疯狂的反华叫嚣，叫嚷印度政府要与蒋介石集团“恢复友好关系”，重建“邦交”，与蒋帮并肩作战“维护亚洲的和平与自由”；要在印度建立一个“中（蒋帮）印经济文化协会”，与蒋帮分子共同策划反华阴谋；印度政府要协助叛国分子达赖喇嘛，“收复”西藏。
    这些印度议员还公然对我国无产阶级文化大革命进行了恶毒的攻击和诬蔑。
    同时，特里维迪还在台北鼓吹，要劝印度政府在今年九月下旬举行的联合国大会上改变立场，支持蒋介石集团继续非法窃踞联合国席位。
    据新德里消息透露，在印度政府派出议会代表团到台湾活动之前，美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯，就煽动印度、日本、印度尼西亚反动军人政权联合起来，共同反华。
    从今年三月，印度总理英迪拉·甘地奔走欧、美，大力鼓吹所谓“一个中国、一个台湾”、台湾地位“有待确定”等谬论以来，印度政府与蒋帮进一步勾结，活动频繁。据印度报纸和蒋帮报纸报道，六月间，印度政府派印度国大党议会党团书记拉古纳特·辛格、印度国大党议员勒肯尼·辛格等两次到台湾同蒋帮进行勾结，发展印蒋之间的贸易和文化关系。
    《印度斯坦时报》、《印度快报》和《德干先驱报》等印度报纸驻东南亚地区记者也奉命于今年五月间“集体访问台湾”。九月初，印度政府还派《印度快报》总编辑莫拉斯到台活动。
    印度政府这样仰承美帝国主义的意志，不择手段地制造“两个中国”，甘心充当美帝国主义和现代修正主义的反华走卒，进一步暴露了印度反动派的丑恶面目。世界上一切反华的“英雄”都没有好下场，印度反动派也决不会例外。
