Japanese youth representatives held demonstrations in Tokyo on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd, protesting against the Sato government's outrageous obstruction of their participation in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. They bravely persisted in their struggle despite the reactionary police's suppression.

On the 20th, Japanese youth representatives demonstrated in front of the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Justice.

On the 21st, another demonstration was held in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The youth representatives, facing fully armed police, angrily shouted slogans such as "Revoke the government's illegal decision!" The officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rudely refused to meet with them.

The number of youth representatives participating in the protest continued to grow. Despite the police's threats of arrest, they sang "Let's Go" in unison, encouraging each other, and began a sit-in protest.

The police swung their batons, attempting to disperse the youth representatives who were steadfast in maintaining Sino-Japanese friendship. Subsequently, they forcibly arrested the chairman of the All-Japan Port Workers' Union delegation, Yamamoto Nobuteru, and others who were preparing to participate in this festival. However, the brave Japanese youth were not intimidated by this suppression. They shouted "Bring back our comrades!" and continued to fight against the reactionaries with unyielding spirit.

On the 22nd, even more Japanese youth, carrying countless banners, marched towards the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The banners read: "We must go to China!" "We must celebrate with Chinese youth!" "Protest against the Sato government's hostile policy towards China!"

Yamamoto Nobuteru, the chairman of the All-Japan Port Workers' Union delegation who had been arrested by the police on the 21st, appeared again in the demonstration with a banner protesting the Sato government's atrocities. The crowd's fighting spirit soared. One Japanese youth representative said, "The Japanese police are the reactionaries' henchmen. They look fierce, but they are actually just tofu tigers." He said that the reactionaries' atrocities could only provoke greater anger among the people.

The Japanese youth, who persisted in their struggle, were all spirited and frequently shouted slogans and sang "Tokyo-Beijing." The Tokyo Youth Delegation held up a large red banner with the words "Long Live the Fighting Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Japan," inspiring the demonstrators' struggle.

At 1:00 PM, more than 170 Japanese youth representatives set out from Hibiya Park in four groups to major stations in Tokyo to distribute "An Open Letter to the Citizens of Tokyo." The letter exposed the Sato government's unreasonable obstruction of the broad masses of Japanese youth from participating in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival and its series of hostile acts towards China and following the United States. The letter also called on the Japanese people to unite and struggle together to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, restore diplomatic relations, and promote Asian peace.

Many citizens, with respect and admiration, continuously encouraged the youth representatives, saying, "You've worked hard," "Keep it up!" "Wish you success in your visit to China!"

    不怕警棍，不怕坐牢，坚决要到中国来！
    日本青年身在东京心向北京
    连日示威游行抗议佐藤政府破坏中日青年友好大联欢
    据新华社二十二日讯  东京消息：日本青年代表二十日、二十一日和二十二日连续在东京举行示威，抗议佐藤政府丧心病狂地阻挠他们到中国去参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢的暴行。他们不顾反动警察的镇压，英勇地坚持斗争。
    二十日，日本青年代表在首相官邸、外务省（外交部）和法务省（司法部）门前举行了示威。
    二十一日，在外务省门前又举行示威。参加示威的青年代表，在全副武装的警察面前愤怒地高呼：“撤销政府的非法决定！”等口号。外务省官员横蛮无理地拒绝会见他们。
    参加抗议行列的青年代表愈来愈多。他们不顾警察要逮捕他们的威胁，高声唱着《加油干》的日本歌曲，互相鼓舞，并且开始了静坐示威。
    警察挥舞警棍，企图以武力驱散这些坚持维护日中友好的青年代表，随后，强行逮捕了准备参加这届大联欢的全日本港湾工会代表团团长山本信晃等人。但是，英勇的日本青年并没有被这种镇压吓倒，他们高呼“还我战友！”大义凛然地继续同反动派斗争。
    二十二日，更多的日本青年举着数不清的标语牌向日本外务省进发。标语牌上边写道：“我们一定要去中国！”“我们一定要同中国青年联欢！”“抗议佐藤政府敌视中国的政策！”
    二十一日曾被警察当局逮捕的全日本港湾工会代表团团长山本信晃，拿着抗议佐藤政府暴行的标语牌，斗志昂扬地又出现在示威游行的行列中，群众的斗志更加昂扬。一位日本青年代表说，“日本警察是反动派的爪牙，看上去气势汹汹，实际上没有什么了不起，只不过是一只豆腐老虎。”他说，反动派的暴行，只能激起人们更大的愤怒。
    坚持斗争的日本青年个个精神抖擞，不时地高呼口号和唱起《东京—北京》的歌曲。东京各界青年代表团举起一面写着“日中人民战斗友谊万岁”的大字巨幅红旗，鼓舞着示威者的斗争。
    下午一点，一百七十多名日本青年代表先后从日比谷公园出发，分四路到东京的几个主要车站去散发《告东京市民书》，揭露佐藤政府无理阻挠广大日本青年参加日中青年友好大联欢和它一系列敌视中国、追随美国的罪行。《告东京市民书》还呼吁日本人民团结一致为增进日中友好、恢复日中邦交，促进亚洲和平而共同斗争。
    不少市民怀着敬意和钦佩的心情不断勉励青年代表说：“你们辛苦了”，“加油干吧！”“祝你们访华成功！”
