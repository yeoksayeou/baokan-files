The autumn harvest season has arrived. Over 800 Red Guards and revolutionary students from Sichuan Medical College have formed a labor force and gone to Chengdu's suburban Victory Commune and Yongfeng Commune to help with the harvesting of late-season rice, receiving warm welcomes and praise from the broad masses of commune members.

In recent days, continuous rain has affected the harvesting of late-season rice. The revolutionary teachers and students of Sichuan Medical College are very anxious. On September 4, after the rain stopped, they dispatched a labor force of over 800 people, carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," to Chengdu's suburban Victory Commune to help with the harvesting of late-season rice. On the 5th and 6th, over 2,000 revolutionary teachers and students went to Yongfeng Commune to participate in the autumn harvest labor.

During the harvest, the Red Guards and revolutionary students saw the poor and lower-middle peasants working tirelessly, harvesting and drying the rice, striving to sell good grain to the state. They were deeply moved and expressed their determination to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants' noble qualities of loving labor, the collective, and the state. Some students even wrote poems to express their feelings: "Harvesting is truly good, tempering and reforming, willing to endure a bit of hardship, not letting a single grain be wasted." They learned from the commune members' examples, working hard in the harvest without fear of hardship, carefully harvesting and threshing to ensure that every grain is returned to the granary. The broad masses of commune members enthusiastically praised them as "good students sent by Chairman Mao."

    据成都晚报讯　秋收大忙季节到来了，四川医学院红卫兵和革命师生八百多人组成的一支劳动大军，分赴成都市郊胜利公社和永丰公社，积极帮助抢收中稻，受到广大社员的热烈欢迎和赞扬。
    连日来，阴雨连绵，影响中稻的收割。四川医学院的革命师生们十分焦急。九月四日，雨后初晴，他们便派出一支由八百多人组成的劳动大军，带上《毛主席语录》和《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，前往市郊胜利公社帮助抢收中稻。五、六两日，革命师生二千多人又去永丰公社参加秋收劳动。
    红卫兵和革命师生在秋收中，看到贫下中农不怕苦、不怕累、边收打、边晾晒，力争把好谷子卖给国家的行为，十分感动。他们纷纷表示要很好地学习贫下中农这种爱劳动、爱集体、爱国家的高贵品质。有的同学还写诗表达自己的感受：“抢收真正好，锻炼又改造，宁肯累一点，颗粒不能抛。”他们学习社员的榜样，在劳动中不怕苦，不怕累，精收细打，保证颗粒还仓。广大社员热烈赞扬他们是“毛主席派来的好学生”。
