	Celebrating the 18th Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
	Korean Chargé d'Affaires Holds Press Conference

	According to Xinhua News Agency on the 3rd, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Kim Jae-suk, held a press conference today to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

	Kim Jae-suk told the reporters that since its establishment, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has steadfastly adhered to the line of building an independent national economy. Now, in North Korea, not only has an advanced social system been established, but also the economic and cultural foundations have been laid for developing the country's life with its own strength. Kim Jae-suk condemned the U.S. imperialists for continuing to occupy South Korea and recently directing their faithful lackey Park Chung-hee to attempt to send more than 20,000 troops of the "White Horse Division" to South Vietnam. The Chargé d'Affaires said that the Korean people, with the support and solidarity of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, will definitely drive out the U.S. aggressor troops and complete the great cause of national reunification.

    据新华社三日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办金在淑，今天举行记者招待会，庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建国十八周年。
    金在淑向记者们说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国从它成立的第一天起，就毫不动摇地坚持了建设自立民族经济的路线。现在朝鲜北半部不仅建立了先进的社会制度，而且奠定了能够用自己的力量发展国家生活的经济、文化的基础。金在淑谴责美帝国主义继续霸占着南朝鲜，最近又指使它的忠实走狗朴正熙企图把“白马部队”的两万多兵力增派到南越。临时代办说，朝鲜人民在全世界爱好和平国家和人民支持和声援下，一定要赶走美国侵略军，完成统一祖国的大业。
