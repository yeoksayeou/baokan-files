Nanping Paper Mill in Fujian Province has achieved remarkable results in both revolution and production during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since July and August, the daily production of newsprint has continuously set new records, surpassing any achievements in the eight years since the mill's establishment. The economic and technical indicators, including product quality, cost, and raw material consumption, have all reached national advanced levels. To produce more and better paper to support the nationwide printing of Chairman Mao's works, the workers have overcome the difficulties of high-temperature operations, seized every minute, and completed the expansion project of the pulping workshop ahead of schedule.

At the same time, the workers have broken away from foreign frameworks and dogmas, through repeated experiments, increased the speed of the paper machine from 215 meters per minute to 240 meters per minute. This not only increased the production of newsprint but also ensured the stable improvement of product quality.

    南平造纸厂创造生产好成绩
    福建南平造纸厂在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命和生产建设齐报捷。七八月份以来，全厂新闻纸的日产量连续创造了建厂八年多以来从未有过的优异成绩，产品质量、成本和原材料消耗等经济技术指标，也都跃入全国先进行列。为了生产更多更好的纸张支援全国印制毛主席著作，职工们克服了高温作业的困难，争分夺秒，提前完成了化浆车间的扩建工程。
    同时，职工还大破洋框框、洋教条，通过反复实验，把纸机的转速由每分钟二百一十五米加快到二百四十米，既增加了新闻纸的产量，又保证了产品质量的稳定提高。
