In recent months, the officers and soldiers of the frontline air force in Fujian have been brimming with fighting spirit, penning a large number of articles criticizing bad films, novels, and works, as well as figures representing the bourgeoisie. They have also created and performed numerous artistic programs. Since the Cultural Revolution, the 9th Company of a certain unit has produced over a hundred artistic programs with good ideological content and strong fighting spirit. Many comrades with lower cultural levels have taken up the pen to create works, and many officers and soldiers who have never performed before have taken to the stage. At the same time, a mass activity of telling revolutionary stories, "The Song of Ouyang Hai," is flourishing. Hundreds of amateur storytellers are active on the coastal defense line, enthusiastically recounting the great Communist warrior Ouyang Hai.

The most distinctive feature of the amateur cultural activities currently flourishing in various units is the unparalleled enthusiasm in praising the great leader Chairman Mao and the fervent admiration for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone says, bourgeois artists never praise Mao Zedong Thought and oppose praising Mao Zedong Thought. We workers, peasants, and soldiers must resolutely sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought, extol the virtues of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! This is our glorious duty, our sacred responsibility, and our lifelong mission! In a short period, soldier Xiao Yunhui of a certain company wrote six programs, each expressing the revolutionary soldier's boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, the eternal red sun in our hearts. It is the most worthy of our praise." During an amateur art performance, a soldier from a certain artillery regiment sang passionately, "Thinking of Chairman Mao, there are countless poems in my heart, countless songs on my lips, and I could sing for three days and nights about my love for Chairman Mao!"

The officers and soldiers proudly declare: The poems we write, the paintings we draw, bourgeois art "authorities" and "experts" could never create. We revolutionary soldiers understand that parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer, nothing is better than Mao Zedong Thought. Our feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought run the deepest. We have the most right to sing the praises of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Writing down our love for Chairman Mao is the best poetry! Recording our praise for Mao Zedong Thought is the most vivid song of praise! We workers, peasants, and soldiers are the most loyal singers of Mao Zedong Thought!

    做毛泽东思想最热情的歌手
    福建前线空军部队在文化大革命中广泛开展业余文化活动
    据新华社福州十三日电　近几个月来，福建前线空军部队的指战员怀着战斗的豪情，纷纷挥笔写出了大量批判坏电影、坏小说、坏作品和资产阶级代表人物的文章，创作和演出了许多文艺节目。某部九连文化大革命以来，编演了一百多个思想内容好、战斗性强的文艺节目。许多文化水平不高的同志拿起了笔杆子搞创作，许多没有演过节目的干部战士登台演出。与此同时，一个群众性的大讲革命故事《欧阳海之歌》的活动正在蓬勃开展，上百名业余故事员活跃在海防线上，大讲伟大的共产主义战士欧阳海。
    各部队正在蓬勃开展的业余文化活动的最大特点是，无比热情地歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，满怀激情地颂扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想。大家说，资产阶级文艺家从来不歌颂毛泽东思想，反对歌颂毛泽东思想。我们工农兵就是要坚决歌毛泽东思想之功，颂共产党、毛主席之德！这是我们光荣的义务，是我们神圣的职责，是我们毕生的战斗任务！某连战士萧运慧在短时间里一连编了六个节目，每个节目都表达了革命战士对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限热爱。他说：毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是我们心中永远不落的红太阳，这是最值得我们歌颂的。某炮团战士在一次业余文艺会演中，深情地唱道：“想起毛主席，心中有千万首诗，嘴上有千万支歌，三天三夜也唱不完对毛主席的热爱！”
    指战员们自豪地说：我们写的这些诗，画的这些画，资产阶级文艺“权威”“专家”一辈子也搞不出来。我们革命战士体会到，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，千好万好不如毛泽东思想好，我们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的感情最深，我们最有资格歌颂毛主席，歌颂毛泽东思想。把我们对毛主席的热爱写出来，就是最好的诗！把我们赞颂毛泽东思想的语言记下来，就是最生动的赞歌！我们工农兵是毛泽东思想最忠诚的歌手！
