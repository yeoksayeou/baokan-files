The Chairman Mao's directive to use ideological struggle instead of physical struggle is extremely wise and great.

In the past, some of our schoolmates had the idea that "there is no way but to fight." Later, we realized: physical struggle, the enemy's skin hurts but their heart does not. They may lower their heads on the surface, but in reality, they are not defeated. Using ideological struggle, you put up a big-character poster, I put up a big-character poster, you go on stage to criticize a few sentences, I go on stage to criticize a few sentences, exposing the enemy's dirty thoughts and evil deeds, making them reveal their true colors.

Physical struggle is a method that does not require much thinking and is simplistic. Ideological struggle can truly temper oneself and receive education. When we engage in ideological struggle with the enemy, it forces us to think. For every word the enemy says, we must ask why in our minds and use Mao Zedong Thought, the sharpest weapon, to analyze it, thus exposing their plots and thoroughly criticizing them. This is precisely a great opportunity for us to study Chairman Mao's works and apply Chairman Mao's works. A struggle meeting is a meeting to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. It is truly a struggle meeting that is worth more than ten years of study.

We, the Red Guards, are Chairman Mao's loyal little red soldiers. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, dare to struggle, and be good at struggling. We must use this most powerful weapon of ideological struggle to thoroughly defeat all anti-party and anti-socialist scoundrels, sending them to the eighteenth level of hell, never to rise again!

    最有效的武器
    北京二中红卫兵　臧玉亭
    毛主席关于要用文斗，不用武斗的指示，非常英明，非常伟大。
    过去，我们学校有的同学也有过“非武斗不行”的想法，以后认识到：武斗，敌人皮痛心不痛，表面上低了头，实际上斗不臭。采用文斗的办法，你一张大字报，我一张大字报，你上台批几句，我上台批几句，把敌人的什么肮脏思想、罪恶行为都抖落出来，叫他来个原形毕露。
    武斗是不动脑筋的、简单化的办法。文斗，才能真正锻炼自己，受到教育。我们跟敌人搞文斗，就逼着我们动脑筋。敌人每讲一句话，我们就要在头脑中问个为什么，还要运用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器来剖析一下，这样来识破他们的阴谋，彻底批判他们。这正是我们学习毛主席著作，运用毛主席著作的大好机会。一场说理斗争会，就是一场学习毛主席著作的讲用会。真是一场斗争会，胜读十年书。
    我们红卫兵，是毛主席的忠实的红小兵。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。我们一定要听毛主席的话，要敢于斗争，善于斗争，要用文斗这个最厉害的武器，把一切反党反社会主义的坏蛋统统打入十八层地狱，让他们永世不得翻身！
