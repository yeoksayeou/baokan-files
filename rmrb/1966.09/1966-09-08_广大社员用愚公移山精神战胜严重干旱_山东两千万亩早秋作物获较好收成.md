In the anti-drought struggle, a large number of cadres went to the front lines, participated in production, and led production. The commercial and other departments actively supported the anti-drought struggle. At present, the province is strengthening the management of late autumn crops to strive for an even greater harvest this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, September 7th: The 20 million mu of early autumn crops in Shandong Province have now basically been harvested. According to relevant departments, the sorghum, corn, and millet that have been threshed in various places have generally achieved good results. The actual yield of early autumn crops in areas such as Linyi and Yantai has mostly exceeded the originally estimated yield.

This year, Shandong experienced severe drought. After the early autumn crops were sown, more than 10 million mu of land in Dezhou, Huimin, and Liaocheng regions had poor germination. Faced with the drought, the cadres and commune members were not discouraged and fought resolutely against it. When encountering difficulties in the anti-drought struggle, the masses used the spirit of Yu Gong moving mountains to fight against the drought. In regions like Dezhou, Huimin, and Liaocheng where there was severe lack of seedlings, the commune members carried water to sow seeds and transplanted seedlings to fill in the gaps. Some areas transplanted seedlings six or seven times, finally achieving full germination. In the anti-drought struggle, a large number of cadres went to the front lines of production, with the determination to "shed several layers of skin and roll in several layers of mud," participating in and leading production alongside the masses. Meanwhile, relevant departments in various places took supporting the anti-drought struggle as their honorable task. Commercial and supply departments delivered goods to the doorstep, medical and cultural workers served in the fields, greatly boosting the enthusiasm of the masses in the anti-drought struggle, and finally enabling them to achieve a good harvest despite the drought.

Currently, the 50 million farmers in Shandong are strengthening the management of late autumn crops, striving for an even greater harvest this year.

    广大社员用愚公移山精神战胜严重干旱
    山东两千万亩早秋作物获较好收成
    在抗旱斗争中，大批干部深入第一线，参加生产，领导生产。商业等部门积极支援抗旱斗争。目前，全省加强晚秋作物管理，争取全年更大丰收
    新华社济南七日电山东省二千万亩早秋作物，目前已基本收割完毕。据有关部门调查，各地已经登场的高粱、玉米、谷子普遍获得了较好收成，临沂、烟台等地区早秋作物的实际产量，大都超过原来的估计产量。
    今年山东干旱严重。早秋作物播种以后，德州、惠民、聊城三个地区的一千多万亩土地出苗不全。在干旱面前，广大干部、社员毫不气馁，同干旱作了坚决的斗争。在抗旱遇到困难时，广大社员就用愚公移山的精神和干旱进行搏斗。德州、惠民、聊城等地区缺苗严重，这些地区的社员就挑水点种，移苗补苗，有的连续补苗六七次，最后终于基本上达到了全苗。在抗旱斗争中，大批干部深入生产第一线，抱着“脱几身皮，滚几身泥”的决心，同广大社员一起，参加生产，领导生产。同时，各地有关部门也把支援抗旱当作自己的光荣任务，商业、供销部门送货上门，医务、文艺战士服务到田，大大鼓舞了广大社员抗旱斗争的积极性，终于使他们在干旱之年获得了好收成。
    目前，山东五千万农民，正加强对晚秋作物的管理，为夺取全年的更大丰收而努力。
