The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution correctly points out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is aimed at revolutionizing people's ideology, thereby making all work done better, faster, and more efficiently." This is indeed the case. The remarkable achievements of Shanghai's textile industry in July and August are a powerful testament to this.

Every year, production in Shanghai's textile industry would decline during July and August. This year, however, textile factories have broken this "rule": production has steadily increased. What caused this change? The only answer is: the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has changed people's spiritual outlook. The revolutionary enthusiasm and wisdom of the broad masses of workers have been fully unleashed, creating new production records.

In our socialist enterprises, there are various "rules." Many of these are closely linked to the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. Only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and using Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon can we thoroughly sweep away the bourgeois "four olds" and establish the proletarian "four news," thereby fundamentally changing the face of enterprises.

The excellent situation in Shanghai's textile industry shows that as long as we firmly take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the guideline, grasp both revolution and production, we will surely achieve victories in both the cultural revolution and production.

The Shanghai textile workers, who are advancing bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have overcome the difficulties of sustained high temperatures and poor raw materials in July and August this year. For the first time, they have broken the "rule" of declining production in the third quarter in the city's textile industry, achieving a situation of increasing production and stable quality.

In July and August, the per-unit production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Shanghai exceeded that of the second quarter, setting a new record in the history of China's textile industry. The production of cotton yarn increased by 12.7% compared to the same period last year, and the production of cotton cloth increased by 13.8%. The production of chemical fiber, wool, and silk textiles has also increased. The quality of various textile products has remained stable.

The remarkable achievements of Shanghai's textile industry fully prove that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful force for revolutionizing people's ideology and promoting the development of productive forces.

During the cultural revolution, workers have thoroughly swept away bourgeois technical "authorities" and established proletarian technical authorities, truly becoming masters of technology. The technical "authority" of Shanghai's 11th Cotton Textile Mill once claimed that the new drafting process could not be used on old machines. Workers did not believe this and, through practice, thoroughly swept away the "authority," making nine old fine-spinning machines, which had been used for over 40 years, use the new drafting process, increasing the drafting efficiency by nearly one fold. The starch paste workshop of Shanghai Dongfanghong Cotton Textile Mill (formerly Shanghai Huafeng Cotton Textile Mill No. 1) had its production technology leadership monopolized by a few technical "authorities," seriously suppressing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers for technological innovation and technological revolution. During this cultural revolution, workers, with their boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and rigorous scientific spirit, thoroughly swept away the "authorities" and actively innovated old processes. As a result, the insulation and discharge time of the steaming ball were shortened, the water washing time of the bleaching starch was shortened, the drying part of the paper-making machine was reformed, and the daily production of starch paste increased from 17 tons to 21 tons.

This year, Shanghai experienced an unprecedented heat wave in July and August. Workers proudly said, "Although it's hot this year, our revolutionary hearts are even hotter. We must shoulder both the cultural revolution and production development." The main cotton yarn variety, 30-count yarn, produced by Shanghai's First Cotton Textile Mill, used late-season cotton with high water content and fine fibers in the hottest July, with machines running 27 more revolutions per minute than the same period last year, and the workshop temperature was also about 2 degrees higher. Due to the workers' wisdom and enthusiasm, various effective measures were taken, and the quality of cotton yarn did not only not decline but actually improved.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further promoted the proletarian spirit of mutual cooperation among the broad masses of workers. Workshops, groups, and shifts support and cooperate with each other, overcoming many difficulties in production and promoting the development of production. The battle cry of "going where there is difficulty to support" has deeply entered people's hearts. The fine-spinning workshop of Shanghai's 21st Cotton Textile Mill lacked labor, and workers from the finishing workshop immediately went to support them. Workers said, "Imperialism and modern revisionism fear our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the improvement of our socialist production. We must unite as one and strive for victories in both revolution and production."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with its unparalleled power, has broken through many unreasonable regulations and systems that have hindered production development and restricted workers' production enthusiasm for many years. Shanghai's 11th Cotton Textile Mill, after thorough exposure by workers and careful study by the factory leadership, abolished the shift handover inspection and deduction system reflecting the capitalist management style, greatly mobilizing workers' production enthusiasm. Workers in two shifts voluntarily established a new shift handover inspection system that jointly cares about production.

### 文化大革命促进了生产大发展  上海纺织生产创全国新水平  纺织工人战胜持续高温等困难，打破每逢第三季度产量下降“常规”，七八月份纱布产量比去年同期大增

    文化大革命促进了生产大发展
    上海纺织生产创全国新水平
    纺织工人战胜持续高温等困难，打破每逢第三季度产量下降“常规”，七八月份纱布产量比去年同期大增
    编者按：《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》正确地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”这个道理是千真万确的。上海纺织工业七、八月份取得的显著成绩，就是有力的证明。
    每逢七八月份，产量就要降低，这是上海纺织工业的“常规”。今年各个纺织厂却打破了这个“常规”：产量稳定地上升了。是什么原因引起这个变化？唯一的答案就是：史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命改变了人的精神面貌，广大职工的革命积极性和智慧，无限地发挥出来，创造了新的生产纪录。
    在我们社会主义企业中，还有种种“常规”。其中，有不少东西是同剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯密切联系着的。只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，大破资产阶级的“四旧”，大立无产阶级的“四新”，才能使企业的面貌，发生根本性的变化。
    上海纺织工业的大好形势表明，只要我们坚决地以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，就一定能够取得文化革命和生产双胜利。
    本报讯　在无产阶级文化大革命中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进的上海纺织工人，今年七、八两月战胜了持续高温和原料较差等等困难，第一次打破了本市纺织业每逢第三季度产量下降的“常规”，出现了产量上升、质量稳定的大好形势。
    七、八两月，上海市棉纱、棉布的单产都超过了第二季度，创造了我国纺织工业历史上最高的生产水平。棉纱产量比去年同期增长百分之十二点七，棉布产量增长百分之十三点八。化学纤维、呢绒、丝绸等纺织品的产量，也有所增长。各类纺织品的质量一直稳定。
    上海纺织行业取得这样显著的成就，充分证明无产阶级文化大革命，是促进人的思想革命化的强大动力，是推动社会生产力发展的强大动力。
    广大工人在文化大革命中，大破资产阶级技术“权威”，大立无产阶级技术权威，真正成了技术的主人。上海第十一棉纺织厂的技术“权威”曾经认为新的牵伸工艺不能在旧机器上使用。工人不相信他们这一套，通过实践，大破“权威”，使九台用了四十多年的老细纱机用上新的牵伸工艺，牵伸效率提高近一倍。上海东方红棉纺织厂（原上海华丰棉纺织一厂）浆粕车间，生产技术领导权，一直垄断在少数技术“权威”手里，严重地压制了广大工人技术革新和技术革命的积极性。在这次文化大革命中，工人们发挥冲天的革命干劲和严格的科学精神，大破“权威”，积极革新旧的工艺。结果，缩短了蒸球的保温时间和出料时间，缩短了漂浆的水洗时间，改革了造纸机的烘燥部分，使每天浆粕产量由十七吨一下提高到二十一吨。
    今年七、八两月，上海出现了罕见的持续高温。工人们豪迈地说：“今年天热，但是，我们一颗革命的红心更热，我们一定要挑好文化大革命和发展生产两副担子。”上海第一棉纺织厂生产的主要棉纱品种三十支纱，在最炎热的七月份，使用的是含水多、纤维细的晚期棉，机器运转每分钟比去年同期加快二十七转多，车间温度也比去年要高两度左右。由于工人发挥了智慧和干劲，采取了种种有效措施，棉纱质量不但没有降低，反而提高了。
    无产阶级文化大革命，促使广大工人互相协作的共产主义风格进一步发扬起来。车间与车间，小组与小组，班次与班次，互相支援，互相协作，克服了生产上的不少困难，促进了生产的发展。“哪里困难就到哪里支援”的战斗口号深入人心。上海第二十一棉纺织厂的细纱车间缺少劳动力，加工车间的工人立即去支援。工人们说：“帝国主义和现代修正主义害怕我们无产阶级文化大革命的发展，害怕我们社会主义生产的提高，我们就要同心协力，争取革命和生产双胜利。”
    无产阶级文化大革命，还以无比的威力，冲破了多年来障碍生产发展和束缚工人生产积极性的许多不合理的规章制度。上海第十一棉纺织厂，经过职工充分揭露和工厂领导的慎重研究，废除了反映资本主义管理作风的交接班检查扣分制度，大大地调动了工人的生产积极性，两班工人自觉地建立起共同关心生产的新的交接班检查制度。
