	Constant Self-Examination, Regular Inspection

	How can we strictly adhere to the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention? I learned a good method from our old quartermaster: use the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention as a "mirror," and examine yourself every night to see what you did right and what you did wrong. For what you did right, continue doing it; for what you did wrong, correct it immediately. Over the years, I have followed this method, examining myself every day, and gradually improved my self-awareness in adhering to the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. In May 1964, one day I returned from buying vegetables in Jiangmen and found that I had six yuan and fifty cents extra. Initially, I thought, "After all, it's public money on both ends, so it's not a big deal." That night, when I used the "mirror" to examine myself, I realized the seriousness of the issue. I understood that this was not just about a few yuan, but about whether to uphold the glorious tradition of discipline and love for the people. Keeping this money would also leave a stain on the honor of the company, tarnish the reputation of a model company, and add impurities to the revolution. Without resting, I hurried to the dock, took a night boat, and rushed to Jiangmen, over two hundred miles away. When I handed the money back to the cashier who had made the mistake, he shook my hand and said, "If I had known the money was mistakenly given to a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, I wouldn't have been so worried." You see, the people have such great trust in our Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention! My original thought was so dangerous! From then on, I examined myself more frequently and strictly.

	I deeply feel that adhering to the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention requires strict self-discipline in every small matter of daily life and work. By handling one matter at a time, deepening one's understanding, and raising one's self-awareness, over time, one will fully and unconditionally execute the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention.

	Hu Tongfu (Deputy Political Instructor, Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works):

	The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention are a revolutionary treasure that has played an extremely great role in the victory of our country's revolutionary wars and in the construction of our army. Currently, our army is tasked with defending the socialist revolution and construction, opposing the aggression of American imperialism, and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the world's people. The requirements for revolutionary construction are higher, and we must further strengthen our sense of policy and discipline, raise our self-awareness in adhering to policies and discipline, to ensure the unity of our army's revolutionary will and the consistency of our combat actions. We must improve the relationships between the military and the people, between the military and the government, and between officers and soldiers, and make full preparations for people's war. To become good successors of the revolutionary cause, we must carry on and pass down the fine traditions of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. How can we do this well? The most fundamental thing is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, repeatedly study the "Order by the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army on the Re-issuance of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and connect it with the history of our army's growth and development over the past few decades, as well as with the history of our company. By deeply understanding the great significance of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, we can ensure that this revolutionary treasure, formulated by Chairman Mao, is passed down from generation to generation in our actual actions.

    时时对照，经常检查
    唐光远（司务长）：
    怎样才能遵守好三大纪律八项注意呢？我从咱们连老司务长那里接过来一条好经验，那就是对照三大纪律八项注意这面“宝镜”，每天晚上都照一照，看看哪些做对了，哪些做错了。做对了的，继续照此办理；做错了的，坚决改，马上改。几年来我按照这条办法行事，坚持天天照，一步一步地提高了遵守三大纪律八项注意的自觉性。一九六四年五月，有一天我从江门市买菜回来，发现多了六元五角钱，开始心想：反正两头都是公家的，没有把它当一回事。那天晚上，我用“宝镜”一照，就“照”出了问题的严重性，意识到这远不是几块钱的问题，而是要不要遵纪爱民光荣传统的大问题。留下这笔钱，也就同时给连队荣誉留下了一个大污点，给四好连队抹灰，给革命掺了假。于是，我顾不得休息，火速地跑到码头，连夜乘船，赶到二百多里外的江门市。当我把钱送回到找错钱的营业员的手里时，他握住我的手说：“要早知道这钱是错找给了解放军同志，我就不用着急了。”你看，群众对我军的三大纪律八项注意是多么信任啊！我原来的想法是多么危险啊！从此，我“照”得更勤更严了。
    我深深地体会到，遵守三大纪律八项注意，要从日常生活、工作中的一件一件小事中，严格要求，处理一件事情，加深一步认识，提高一次自觉性，天长日久，就会完全自觉地、不折不扣地执行三大纪律八项注意。
    胡同福（副指导员、学习毛主席著作积极分子）：
    三大纪律八项注意这件革命传家宝，对我国革命战争的胜利，对我军建设起了极其伟大的作用。当前，我军肩负了保卫社会主义革命和社会主义建设，反对美帝国主义侵略，支援世界人民革命的神圣任务，对革命化建设的要求更高了，必须更进一步地增强政策纪律观念，提高遵守政策纪律的自觉性，以保证我军革命意志的统一，战斗行动的一致。必须把军民关系，军政关系，官兵关系搞得更好，做好人民战争的充分准备。我们要当好革命事业接班人，就要把三大纪律八项注意的优良传统接过来，传下去。怎样才能接好传好呢？最根本的是要活学活用毛主席著作，反复学习《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》一文，联系我军几十年来成长、发展的历史，结合本连连史，深刻领会三大纪律八项注意的伟大意义，从而在实际行动中做到把毛主席制定的这个革命法宝世世代代传下去。
