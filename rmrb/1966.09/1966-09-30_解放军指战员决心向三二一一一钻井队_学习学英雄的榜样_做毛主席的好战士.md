The heroic collective shining with the great thought of Mao Zedong—the 32111 Drilling Team—has published its moving story of extinguishing a sea of fire and protecting a large gas well. This news, like a spring thunder, has spread throughout the People's Liberation Army's land, naval, and air forces. Broad masses of officers and soldiers have enthusiastically shouted, "The invincible thought of Mao Zedong is eternal! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They say that the heroes of the drilling team have, with their heroic actions, composed another great song of Mao Zedong Thought, setting a brilliant example for us to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, turning Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious actions. Broad masses of cadres and soldiers are determined to learn from the heroic drilling team, "to imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions." On the extremely proletarian and extremely militant revolutionary path, they will forge themselves into revolutionary soldiers who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. They will turn the army into a collective of Huang Jiguang, a collective of Qiu Shaoyun, a collective of Ouyang Hai, and a collective of Mai Xiande.

When the heroic deeds of the drilling team were broadcast and reported in various units' barracks, training grounds, construction sites, outposts, naval docks, and air force bases, the broad masses of officers and soldiers were stirred with excitement, spreading the news and holding study sessions and discussions. Some units immediately took up their pens to express their admiration and resolve to study Chairman Mao's works; some companies immediately held discussion meetings, studying Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people and daring to struggle and dare to win, using the drilling team's glorious deeds as an example, comparing themselves, and revising their study plans. Some officers and soldiers, after studying, were so moved that they couldn't sleep at night and got up to study again. Soldiers from the 11th Company of a certain unit in Nanjing wrote down their heroic oaths with tears of excitement: "Learn from the heroes, march forward on the heroes' path!"

Various units' broad masses of officers and soldiers believe that to learn the heroes' thoughts, walk the heroes' path, and create heroic achievements, the most fundamental thing is to learn from the brave men who treat reading Chairman Mao's books as their first need in life. The officers and soldiers of a certain squadron in the Air Force said: "To die for the people's interests, even a short life is heavier than Mount Tai; to live not for the people, living a lifetime is meaningless." Political instructor Qiao Yunqi of the Red Ninth Company in a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region said: "The heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team once again tell us that the company's work, though complex, ultimately boils down to arming everyone's mind with Mao Zedong Thought, making soldiers possess red souls, thus creating heroes like the 32111 Drilling Team and achieving human miracles. In the future, we must strive to run a Mao Zedong Thought school, using Mao Zedong Thought to lead 100% of the work, occupying 100% of the positions, and contributing to the communist cause." Deputy political instructor Mei Songlin of the Sixth Company in the Wuhan Military Region excitedly said: "The heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team declare to the world that once the great thought of Mao Zedong is grasped by the revolutionary masses, it will turn into a great material force. We are determined to study Chairman Mao's works with all our might, building the company into an indomitable and invincible revolutionary force, making imperialism, revisionism, reactionaries, and all ghosts and snakes nothing to fear."

In recent days, units in Beijing, Guangzhou, Kunming, Chengdu, Lanzhou, and the front lines in Fujian have widely carried out activities to learn from the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team. Officers and soldiers say that Comrade Lin Biao has called on us to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially to focus on the "use" aspect. The 32111 Drilling Team is a brilliant example of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. Officers and soldiers are determined to follow this example, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldviews, using it in the ongoing Cultural Revolution, and using it in the struggle against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

    解放军指战员决心向三二一一一钻井队
    学习学英雄的榜样  做毛主席的好战士
    据新华社二十九日讯　闪耀着伟大毛泽东思想光辉的英雄集体——32111钻井队，扑灭火海、保住大气井的可歌可泣的英雄事迹一发表，犹如一声春雷，传遍了中国人民解放军陆、海、空三军各部队。广大指战员纵情高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们说，钻井队的勇士们以英雄的行动谱出了又一曲伟大毛泽东思想凯歌，为我们树立了活学活用毛主席著作、把毛主席指示变为自觉行动的光辉榜样。广大干部、战士决心向英雄钻井队学习，“把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命大路上，把自己锻炼成为永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于党、忠于人民的革命战士，把部队办成为集体的黄继光、集体的邱少云、集体的欧阳海、集体的麦贤得。
    当钻井队的英雄事迹通过广播、报纸传到各部队营房、操场、工地、哨所和海军码头、空军机场时，广大指战员热血沸腾，奔走相告，纷纷进行学习、座谈。有的单位立即奋笔疾书向英雄的钻井队表示敬爱之情和学习毛主席著作的决心；有的连队立即举行座谈会，学习毛主席有关为人民服务和敢于斗争、敢于胜利的论述，以英雄钻井队的光辉事迹为榜样，对照自己，修订学习计划。有的指战员学了以后，激动得夜不成眠，爬起来再学。南京部队某部十一连有的战士流着热泪，挥笔写下了豪迈的誓言：向英雄学习，踏着英雄的道路前进！
    各部队广大指战员认为：要学英雄的思想，走英雄的道路，创英雄的业绩，千条万条，最根本的一条，就是要学习勇士们把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要。空军某部杜凤瑞中队的干部战士们说：“为人民利益而死，生命再短，也重于泰山；不是为人民而活，活一辈子也没有意义。”沈阳部队某部红九连指导员乔云岐说：“32111钻井队的英雄事迹再一次告诉我们，连队的工作千头万绪，归根到底，就是用毛泽东思想武装每个人的头脑，使战士都具有鲜红的灵魂，这样才能出现像32111钻井队那样的英雄，创造出人间奇迹。今后我们更要全力办好毛泽东思想大学校，用毛泽东思想统帅百分之百的工作，占领百分之百的阵地，为共产主义事业做出贡献。”武汉部队硬骨头六连副指导员梅松林激动地说：“32111钻井队的英雄事迹，向全世界宣告，伟大的毛泽东思想一旦为革命群众所掌握，就会变成伟大的物质力量。我们决心拚命学习毛主席著作，把连队建设成拖不垮打不烂，无坚不摧无攻不克的革命队伍，什么帝国主义、修正主义、反动派，什么牛鬼蛇神，都不在话下。”
    北京、广州、昆明、成都、兰州和福建前线部队等，这几天从机关到连队，广泛开展学习32111钻井队英雄事迹的活动。指战员们说，林彪同志号召我们活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在用字上狠下功夫。32111钻井队就是活学活用毛主席著作的光辉样板。指战员们决心照这个样板去做，把毛泽东思想用在改造自己的世界观上，用在正在开展的无产阶级文化大革命中，用在反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的斗争中。（附图片）
