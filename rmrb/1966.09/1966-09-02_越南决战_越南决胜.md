	The Decisive Battle and Victory in Vietnam
	Chen Ziping, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the People's Republic of China

	This year's National Day, September 2, arrives amidst the surging tide of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle from north to south. The entire military and civilian population of Vietnam, in response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's sacred call, are highly spirited in their resolve to decisively defeat the American aggressors; the patriotic emulation movement to kill the enemy and achieve victory, and to promote production, is flourishing on both the front lines and in the rear.

	The current struggle of the Vietnamese people is a continuation of their glorious revolutionary cause over the past twenty-one years. The tradition of decisive battles and victories in revolutionary times is being inherited and carried forward in today's anti-American national salvation struggle. The Vietnamese people, with their resolve to decisively defeat the enemy, united in 1945 to successfully launch the general uprising and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Vietnamese people, with their resolve to decisively defeat the enemy, defeated 600,000 French expeditionary forces and achieved a resounding victory at Dien Bien Phu, liberating half of the country, and then in North Vietnam, fundamentally eliminated the exploiting classes and initially established an independent, autonomous, and relatively complete economy as the foundation of socialism. The Vietnamese people, with their resolve to decisively defeat the enemy, have risen up to smash the enemy's shackles in South Vietnam, defeated American imperialism's "special warfare," and recently shattered its dry-season strategic counteroffensive, initially defeated its "limited war" in South Vietnam, and initially defeated its war of destruction in North Vietnam. The great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people over the past twenty-one years are the result of the unity and resolute revolution of the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party headed by Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

	The Vietnamese people's struggle for national salvation against American aggression is developing smoothly, and the strength of the Vietnamese people in all aspects is growing rapidly. The continuous revolutionary struggle over the past twenty-one years has brought about profound changes in the lives of the Vietnamese people, the most important of which is that the Vietnamese people now possess immense power: the socialist North has a strong economic and national defense force; the South, with its vast liberated areas, has an invincible people's armed force. The Vietnamese people, mainly relying on their own strength and revolutionary struggle experience, are defeating the head of imperialism. American imperialism, with 300,000 expeditionary forces and 500,000 puppet troops, has not been able to turn the situation around, and instead, it is deeply mired in the quagmire of failure. The myth of American imperialism's "tremendous power" is being reduced to ashes in the blazing fire of the people's war highly developed by the 31 million Vietnamese people. American imperialism is attempting to find a way out through its adventurous and brutal "escalation." It is plotting to throw even bigger stakes into a new gamble of chance. The entire Vietnamese people are ready at any time to engage, no matter how many enemies come, and are determined to annihilate them. The Vietnamese people, with their resolve to decisively defeat the enemy, are resolutely smashing all the enemy's greatest efforts to completely change the situation and achieve great victories in the cause of national liberation. This is also the inheritance and development of the revolutionary tradition over the past twenty-one years.

	This tradition and spirit are shining in Chairman Ho Chi Minh's magnificent proclamation and are spurring on every Vietnamese. The entire Vietnamese people are sparing no effort to defeat the American aggressors. To liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately achieve the peaceful reunification of the country, the Vietnamese people are prepared to overcome all difficulties and hardships and bear the necessary sacrifices. The Vietnamese people are determined to carry their revolutionary cause to final victory. All of American imperialism's schemes and tricks for "peace talks" will surely fail. The only way to solve the Vietnamese question is to respect the basic and sacred national rights that the Vietnamese people have defended with their blood over the past twenty-one years, that is, the four-point proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Vietnam will decisively defeat and Vietnam will achieve victory, and it will definitely make American imperialism suffer a thorough defeat.

	In each of their revolutionary stages, the Vietnamese people have always received the immense and precious sympathy, support, and assistance of the fraternal Chinese people. Aggression against Vietnam is aggression against China. The 700 million people of China are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. This is the firm stance of revolutionary comrades. To provide all necessary assistance to the Vietnamese people to defeat the American aggressors, this is the attitude of deep fraternal affection and solidarity in battle. The Vietnamese people sincerely thank the Government of China, the Communist Party of China, and the fraternal Chinese people for their sympathy, support, and assistance filled with proletarian internationalism. The fraternal affection and fighting unity of the Chinese people for the Vietnamese people have further strengthened the Vietnamese people's resolve to decisively defeat the enemy.

	The past twenty-one years have been twenty-one years of decisive battles and victories for the Vietnamese people, and the upcoming stage will surely be a stage of decisive battles and victories for the Vietnamese people. Relying on our revolutionary traditions and revolutionary spirit, and with the sympathy, support, and assistance of the people of the world, the Vietnamese people firmly believe that the cause of national salvation against American aggression will achieve brilliant victories.

    越南决战  越南决胜
    越南民主共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使　陈子平
    今年的“九·二”国庆节是在越南人民抗美救国的气势从北到南沸腾高涨的情况下来到的。越南全国军民响应胡志明主席神圣的号召，高度发扬决战决胜美国侵略强盗的精神；杀敌立功，促进生产的爱国竞赛运动正在前线和后方蓬勃开展。
    越南人民当前的战斗是越南人民二十一年来光荣的革命事业的继续。革命年代中决战决胜的传统在今天的抗美救国战斗中得到继承和发扬。越南人民决战决胜，于一九四五年一致起来胜利地举行总起义，并建立起越南民主共和国。越南人民决战决胜，打败了六十万名法国远征军，在奠边府取得了轰轰烈烈的胜利，解放了半部国土，接着在越南北方从根本上消灭了剥削阶级，初步建立起作为社会主义基础的独立、自主和较为完整的经济。越南人民决战决胜，已经起来砸烂敌人在越南南方的桎梏，打败美帝国主义在越南南方的“特种战争”，最近已粉碎了美帝国主义的旱季战略反攻，初步击败了它在越南南方的“局部战争”，初步击败了它在越南北方的破坏战争。越南人民二十一年来取得的伟大胜利是以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党领导下的越南人民团结一致，坚决革命的结果。
    越南人民的抗美救国战斗正在顺利发展，越南人民各方面的力量正在迅速成长。二十一年来持续的革命斗争已在越南人民的生活中产生了深刻的变化，其中最重要的变化是越南人民已拥有了巨大的力量：社会主义的北方有着雄厚的经济力量和国防力量；有着广大解放区的南方，有无往不胜的人民武装力量。越南人民主要是依靠自己的力量和革命斗争经验，正在击败帝国主义的头子。美帝国主义用三十万远征军和五十万伪军也没有能够扭转局势，相反，它正深陷在失败的泥潭中。所谓美帝国主义“庞大的威力”的神话，正在三千一百万越南人民高度发展了的人民战争的烈火中化为灰烬。美帝国主义妄想从冒险和残暴的“升级”中寻找出路。它正蓄谋把更大的赌注投入一场新的、靠运气的赌博。越南全国人民随时准备奉陪，不管来多少敌人也准备同他们打，并一定要消灭他们。决战决胜的越南人民坚决粉碎敌人所作的一切最大努力，以便完全改变局势，在民族解放事业中夺取巨大胜利。这也是二十一年来的革命传统的继承和发扬。
    这种传统和精神已在胡志明主席气壮山河的文告中放射出光芒，并且正在鞭策着每一个越南人。越南全国人民正在全力以赴，战胜美国侵略强盗。为了解放南方，保卫北方，进而和平统一祖国，越南人民准备越过一切困难和艰辛，并承担必要的牺牲。越南人民决心把自己的革命事业进行到最后胜利。美帝国主义的一切“和平谈判”的阴谋诡计必将破产，解决越南问题的唯一途径是尊重越南人民二十一年来用鲜血捍卫的基本和神圣的民族权利，也就是越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。越南决战，越南决胜，并且一定要叫美帝国主义遭到彻底失败。
    越南人民在自己的各个革命阶段中，一向得到兄弟的中国人民无比巨大和珍贵的同情、支持和援助。对越南的侵略，就是对中国的侵略，中国七亿人民，是越南人民的坚强后盾，中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方，这就是革命同志的坚定立场。向越南人民提供一切必要的援助，以便战胜美国侵略强盗，这就是亲密兄弟情深谊重的态度。越南人民真诚地感谢中国政府、中国共产党和兄弟的中国人民充满着无产阶级国际主义精神的同情、支持和援助。中国人民对越南人民的兄弟情谊和战斗的团结更加增强了越南人民决战决胜的信念。
    过去的二十一年是越南人民决战决胜的二十一年，即将到来的阶段也必定是越南人民决战决胜的阶段。依靠我们革命的传统和革命的精神，又有全世界人民的同情、支持和援助，越南人民坚信，抗美救国事业一定取得辉煌的胜利。
