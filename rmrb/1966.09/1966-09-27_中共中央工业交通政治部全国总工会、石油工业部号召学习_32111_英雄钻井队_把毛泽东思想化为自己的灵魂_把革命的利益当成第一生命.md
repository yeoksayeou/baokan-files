The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Industrial and Transportation Political Department and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have issued a notice calling on all workers in the industrial and transportation sectors nationwide to launch campaigns to publicize and learn from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team. The full text of the notice is as follows:

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a heroic collective shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought has emerged on the frontline of China's petroleum industry—the 32111 Drilling Team. On June 22 of this year, in the battle to extinguish a gas well fire, they fought bravely, tenaciously, and selflessly, overcoming all difficulties. With their blood and lives, they extinguished the inferno, rescued a high-yield natural gas well, and preserved a new large gas field, making a brilliant contribution to the motherland and the people.

In this life-and-death struggle against the flames, six comrades—Party member Zhang Yongqing, Young Communist League members Wang Ping, Luo Huatai, Wu Zhongqi, Wang Zuming, and Deng Miquan—sacrificed their lives. Comrades Zhang Zhongmin, Lei Hongbin, Wang Youfa, Ran Shurong, Wang Cunyu, Peng Meifen, Cao Shengguo, Xu Yuancai, Xu Yongmao, Hu Debin, Huang Chenghou, Qin Huaming, Li Zhiguo, Tong Shouzhi, Zhong Yingchang, Cha Shuihai, Teng Huailu, Xu Guangyi, Fu Zhengjiang, Heng Sishu, Peng Xianghe, and twenty-one others were seriously injured. The heroes' deeds are earth-shaking and moving. They are good soldiers of Chairman Mao, fine sons of the working class; they are collective Yang Jianliangs, Qiu Shaoyuns, collective Ouyang Hais, Wang Jies, Mai Xiandes, and Liu Yingjuns… They are a new generation of communists nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. They regard reading Chairman Mao's books as their first need in life, turn Mao Zedong Thought into their soul, make executing Chairman Mao's instructions an automatic action, and regard revolutionary interests as their first priority, setting a brilliant example for all workers in the industrial and transportation sectors.

Like the countless heroes who have emerged in the Mao Zedong era, the source of the strength of all members of the heroic drilling team lies in the great Mao Zedong Thought. The team members love and are loyal to Chairman Mao and the Party without limit. They regard Chairman Mao as the red sun in their hearts and Mao Zedong Thought as their lifeline. They love reading Chairman Mao's books the most and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, consistently insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions in everything. They use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their subjective and objective worlds, seriously study the heroic models of the People's Liberation Army, and gradually establish a communist worldview of not seeking fame or personal gain, fearing neither hardship nor death, dedicating themselves to the revolution, and serving the people wholeheartedly. In the storms of class struggle, they stand firm, love and hate clearly, and resolutely fight against all class enemies, vowing to defend Party Central, Chairman Mao, and the iron-clad mountains and rivers of the proletariat. In their daily work, they have strong revolutionary will and enthusiasm, stand on their own posts, and look at the world. In the life-and-death struggle against the flames, they remember Chairman Mao's teachings, regard the battle to extinguish the raging fire as the "Battle of Triangle Hill," see themselves as soldiers of the People's Liberation Army commanded by Chairman Mao, and vow, "Chairman Mao is always with us. We will not leave our posts even in death." In the hospital, their first request is to study Chairman Mao's quotations. They draw immense spiritual strength from Chairman Mao's instructions and overcome the excruciating pain of burns. All this vividly proves that the members of the heroic drilling team have truly achieved the goal of "imprinting Chairman Mao's instructions in their minds, dissolving them in their blood, and implementing them in their actions." They are exemplary in studying, implementing, promoting, and defending Mao Zedong Thought.

The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee emphasized that the whole Party and the nation should study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, which is a major event of historical significance. Under the current great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, launching campaigns to publicize and learn from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team among all workers in the industrial and transportation sectors is of great significance in better implementing the instructions of the Party Central Committee, further launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoting the participation of all workers in the industrial and transportation sectors in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and advancing the revolutionization of workers' thoughts and a new high tide in production and construction.

All workers in the industrial and transportation sectors must seriously study the heroic deeds of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team. They should take the heroic drilling team as an example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, regard reading Chairman Mao's books as their first need in life, study and apply them actively, and make executing Chairman Mao's instructions an automatic action. They should learn to turn Mao Zedong Thought into their soul, love, be loyal to, believe in, and worship Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought without limit; always be loyal to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, the Party, and the proletarian revolutionary cause. They should learn to regard revolutionary interests as their first priority, not seek fame or personal gain, fear neither hardship nor death, dedicate themselves to the revolution, and serve the people wholeheartedly. They should learn to protect state property and the safety of class brothers in danger, fearlessly and selflessly, and be ready to sacrifice everything in the spirit of proletarian revolutionaries. They should learn to unite as one, work together, advance bravely, and fight heroically in the spirit of proletarian collective heroism.

Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Sixteen Points," which state: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of productive forces in our country." "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to revolutionize people's thoughts, so that all work can be done better, faster, and more economically." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to transform people's souls and a great revolution to promote social production. We must learn from the heroic deeds of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team, take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the guideline, grasp both revolution and production, and promote production. All workers must, in the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in learning from the deeds of the heroic drilling team, channel their surging revolutionary enthusiasm into production struggles and scientific experiments, firmly guard their production posts, and complete their production and construction tasks more excellently, ensuring victory in both revolution and production!

The Party Committee of the Ministry of Petroleum recently decided to call on all workers and their families in the petroleum industry to seriously study the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team. The decision requires all units to, through study, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a greater high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further deepen the revolutionization of workers' thoughts, and achieve greater victories in the three great revolutionary movements.

The decision states that the members of the 32111 Team, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, responded resolutely to the great call of Party Central and Chairman Mao to petroleum workers to find gas and oil, regarded their personal lives and deaths as trivial, and highly carried forward the spirit of proletarian revolutionary heroism, daring to face fire and death, fearing neither hardship nor death, fighting bravely and tenaciously, and extinguishing a major fire, preserving a high-yield gas well, and making a major contribution to the Party and the people.

In this heroic struggle against the fire, many moving heroic deeds emerged. Some comrades fearlessly guarded their posts and sacrificed their lives in the rescue, while others were seriously injured. The injured comrades, upon regaining consciousness in the hospital, first asked for the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and inquired, "Has the well been sealed?" "Has the fire been extinguished?" During treatment, they fought resolutely against the pain with the iron will of proletarian fighters. All this fully demonstrates their proletarian fighting spirit and self-sacrificing spirit, and their fearless heroic spirit of revolutionaries facing danger. They are glorious soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, outstanding children of the Party, and heroes in the style of "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande on the petroleum front. They are excellent examples for all petroleum workers and their families to learn from.

The decision states that their heroic deeds once again prove that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a powerful material force; people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, most intelligent, and most united, with the firmest stance; people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can achieve not seeking fame or personal gain, fearing neither hardship nor death, dedicating themselves to the revolution, and serving the people wholeheartedly.

The decision points out that to commend their heroic deeds, the 32111 Team is awarded the title of "Model Red Banner Unit of the Ministry of Petroleum," and the team is named the "Proletarian Revolutionary Heroic Drilling Team." The six comrades who sacrificed their lives—Zhang Yongqing, Wang Ping, Luo Huatai, Wang Zuming, Wu Zhongqi, and Deng Miquan—are posthumously awarded the title of "Model Workers of the Ministry of Petroleum." Comrades Zhang Zhongmin, Lei Hongbin, Wang Cunyu, Wang Youfa, Hu Debin, Ran Shurong, and Peng Jiazhi, who bravely fought the fire, are awarded the title of "Model Workers of the Ministry of Petroleum." Comrade Mu Maoxiu, a family member who bravely fought the fire, is awarded the title of "Model Family Member of the Ministry of Petroleum." Comrades Li Zhiguo, Tong Shouzhi, Zhong Yingchang, Cha Shuihai, Teng Huailu, Xu Guangyi, Fu Zhengjiang, Peng Xianghe, Heng Sishu, Xu Yongmao, Peng Meifen, Cao Shengguo, Xu Yuancai, Huang Chenghou, Qin Huaming, and Wang Mingju, who bravely fought the fire, are awarded the title of "Model Workers of the Ministry of Petroleum." All workers and family members who actively participated in the fire rescue are commended in a circular.

The decision calls on all workers and their families in the petroleum industry, in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to learn from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, regarding reading Chairman Mao's books as the first need in life, studying and applying them actively, and making executing Chairman Mao's instructions an automatic action; learn from their turning Mao Zedong Thought into their soul, loving, being loyal to, believing in, and worshipping Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought without limit; learn from their regarding revolutionary interests as their first priority, not seeking fame or personal gain, fearing neither hardship nor death, dedicating themselves to the revolution, and serving the people wholeheartedly; learn from their fearlessly and selflessly protecting state property and the safety of class brothers in danger, and being ready to sacrifice their lives in the spirit of proletarian revolutionaries; learn from their uniting as one, working together, advancing bravely, and fighting heroically in the spirit of proletarian collective heroism.

    新华社二十六日讯　中共中央工业交通政治部和中华全国总工会发出通知，号召全国工业交通战线全体职工开展宣传和学习32111英雄钻井队的活动。通知全文如下：
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国石油工业战线上出现了一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄集体——32111钻井队。他们在今年六月二十二日扑灭气井火灾的战斗中，英勇顽强，前赴后继，奋不顾身，排除万难，用鲜血和生命扑灭了火海，抢救了高产天然气井，保住了一个新的大气田，为祖国和人民作出了光辉的贡献。
    在这场血战火海、抢救气井的生死搏斗中，共产党员张永庆、共青团员王平和罗华太、吴仲启、王祖明、邓木全等六同志壮烈牺牲，张仲珉、雷洪炳和王有发、冉树荣、王存友、彭美凤、曹升国、徐元才、许永茂、胡德炳、黄成厚、秦华明、李治国、同守志、钟应昌、查水海、滕怀路、徐光益、傅正江、衡思树、彭祥和等二十一名同志英勇负伤。勇士们的英雄事迹，惊天动地，可歌可泣。他们是毛主席的好战士，工人阶级的好儿女；他们是集体的黄继光、邱少云，他们是集体的欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊……，是毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的共产主义一代新人。他们把读毛主席的书看作生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动，把革命利益当成第一生命，为我国工业交通战线的全体职工树立了光辉的榜样。
    同毛泽东时代涌现出来的千千万万个英雄人物一样，英雄钻井队全体职工的力量源泉，来自伟大的毛泽东思想。这个队的职工对毛主席、对党无限热爱，无限忠诚，把毛主席看做心中的红太阳，把毛泽东思想当做自己的命根子。他们最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话，一贯坚持活学活用毛主席著作，处处按照毛主席的指示办事。他们坚持用毛泽东思想改造主观世界和客观世界，认真学习解放军的英雄模范人物，逐步树立了不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死，一心为革命，一切为人民的共产主义世界观。他们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，立场坚定，爱憎分明，最坚决地同一切阶级敌人作斗争，誓死保卫党中央，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫无产阶级的铁打江山。他们在日常的工作中，革命意志旺盛，革命干劲冲天，立足本岗位，放眼全世界。他们在血战火海的生死关头，牢记毛主席的教导，把扑灭冲天大火的斗争当作“上甘岭战役”，把自己看成是毛主席统帅的解放军战士，“毛主席永远在我们身边，我们死也不能离开战斗的岗位”。他们在医院里第一个要求就是学毛主席语录，他们从毛主席的指示中，汲取巨大的精神力量，战胜了烧伤的剧痛。所有这些都生动地证明：英雄钻井队的职工，真正做到了“把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”他们是努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，积极宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想的典范。　　
    党的八届十一中全会强调指出，全党全国大学毛泽东同志著作，是一个具有历史意义的重大事件。在当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，在全国工业交通战线的全体职工中，开展宣传和学习32111英雄钻井队的活动，对于更好地贯彻执行党中央的指示，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，推动工业交通战线全体职工积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，促进职工思想革命化和生产建设新高潮，都有重大的意义。

    毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条指出：“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”无产阶级文化大革命，既是改造人的灵魂的大革命，也是促进社会生产的大革命。我们学习32111英雄钻井队的英雄事迹，必须以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，一手抓革命，一手抓生产。抓革命，促生产。所有职工都要在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，在学习英雄钻井队的事迹中，把焕发起来的冲天革命干劲用到生产斗争和科学实验中去，坚守生产岗位，更出色地完成生产建设任务，保证革命和生产的双胜利！

    在这场与大火的英勇搏斗中，涌现了许许多多可歌可泣的英雄事迹。他们临危不惧、坚守岗位，有的在救火中英勇牺牲，有的光荣负伤。负伤的同志送到医院，从昏迷中醒来，第一个要求就是要《毛主席语录》，又问：“井关住了没有？”“火灭了没有？”在治疗中间，他们又以无产阶级战士钢铁般的顽强意志同伤痛作坚决的斗争。所有这些，充分表现了他们的无产阶级斗争精神和自我牺牲精神，表现了革命者临危不惧的大无畏的英雄气概。他们是毛泽东思想武装起来的光荣战士，是党的优秀儿女，是“铁人”王进喜式的英雄人物，是石油工业战线上的王杰、麦贤得式的英雄人物，是我们全体石油职工和家属学习的好榜样。
    决定说，他们的英雄事迹，再一次雄辩地说明，毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成强大的物质力量；用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢、最聪明、最齐心，立场最坚定；用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就能做到不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死，一心为革命，一切为人民。
