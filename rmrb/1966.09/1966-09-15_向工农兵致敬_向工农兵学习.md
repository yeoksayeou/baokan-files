Mao Zedong comrade pointed out as early as the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War: “The fundamental revolutionary force is the workers and peasants, and the revolutionary leading class is the working class. Without this fundamental revolutionary force and without the leadership of the working class, it is impossible to complete the democratic revolution against imperialism and feudalism.”

Similarly, without the leadership of the working class and without the fundamental revolutionary force of the workers and peasants, it is impossible to carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction; it is also impossible to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Under the leadership of Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the People's Liberation Army, which is composed of their children, have always been the main force in China's revolutionary and construction undertakings. They have fought a long and arduous struggle against powerful enemies both at home and abroad. The three mountains weighing on the heads of the Chinese people were overthrown by them. The proletarian heaven and the people's heaven were won by them. This poor and backward Eastern country, which was once looked down upon, has changed its old face and created new miracles through the hard work, bravery, and wisdom of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In a short historical period, it has become a proletarian iron fortress standing in the world.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have established immortal merits in China's great revolutionary and construction undertakings. We pay tribute to the workers, peasants, and soldiers!

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the tasks shouldered by the working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants are both glorious and arduous. They respond to the call of Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee, grasping revolution with one hand and production with the other. They must fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, sweep away all monsters and demons, and carry out the revolutionary movement in their own units; they must also guard their own posts and strive to improve industrial and agricultural production.

Further improving industrial and agricultural production is closely linked to the victory and progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The more the cultural revolution is on the rise, the deeper the class struggle goes, the more it is necessary to follow the requirements of the Party Central Committee's Sixteen Points, to grasp revolution and promote production.

This year is the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. The situation in industrial and agricultural production is good, and the autumn harvest is guaranteed to be bountiful. It is completely possible to achieve a significant increase in industrial and agricultural production. This requires that in the remaining few months, all comrades in industry, agriculture, transportation, finance, commerce, services, and other sectors must work hard and strive to overfulfill the tasks assigned by the Party and the state.

Production cannot be stopped. The cultural revolution in factories and rural areas should be carried out in combination with the original deployment of the "Four Cleanups" movement. In the rural areas during the autumn harvest, the movement can be temporarily suspended. Red Guards and revolutionary students in primary and secondary schools do not need to go to factories and rural areas to conduct revolutionary linkages and interfere with the deployment there. Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants can certainly carry out the revolutionary movement in their own units. At the same time, it should be pointed out that workers, commune members, and cadres in institutions and enterprises cannot take vacations like primary and secondary school students, nor should they go to other places to conduct revolutionary linkages. The broad masses of workers and peasants should channel the revolutionary enthusiasm aroused from the cultural revolution and the "Four Cleanups" movement into production labor, promoting various tasks to be done more, faster, better, and more economically.

Many industrial and mining enterprises and many rural people's communes have done this, and done it very well, with great achievements. There, the class consciousness of the workers and peasants has greatly increased, and the enthusiasm for production has reached an unprecedented level. Attendance rates have increased, output has grown, and quality has improved. All industrial and mining enterprises and all rural people's communes across the country should strive to catch up with such advanced units.

The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army should firmly guard their battle positions, emphasize politics, carry forward the spirit of the August First, and strengthen political and military training. They must maintain high vigilance and be on high alert, ready to repel and smash any sudden attacks that the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs might launch.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in China have, through long-term revolutionary struggles, formed a flesh-and-blood bond with the Party and are heart-to-heart with Chairman Mao. They love Chairman Mao the most, read Chairman Mao's books the most, and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Whatever Chairman Mao says, they do. In the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will certainly hold aloft the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, study and apply Chairman Mao's works more actively, and set an example and take the lead everywhere, making greater contributions to the construction and defense of our great socialist motherland and to supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

Mao Zedong comrade said: "Many things cannot be learned solely from books; one must learn from the producers, learn from the workers, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants." He also called on, "The people of the whole country should learn from the People's Liberation Army."

This instruction by Mao Zedong comrade is very important for the Red Guards and revolutionary students in primary and secondary schools.

The Red Guards and revolutionary students should take the workers, peasants, and soldiers as their examples and humbly learn from them. Learn from their hardworking and arduous struggle spirit, learn from their simple and modest style, learn from their revolutionary qualities of being ruthless to the enemy and kind to their own people, learn from their high sense of organization and discipline, learn from their revolutionary style of adhering to the truth, correcting mistakes, and daring to engage in self-criticism.

We must temper ourselves into good soldiers and students of Chairman Mao in the great storms of the cultural revolution struggle, and become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people.

### 向工农兵致敬　向工农兵学习

    向工农兵致敬　向工农兵学习
    毛泽东同志早在抗日战争初期就指出：“……根本的革命力量是工农，革命的领导阶级是工人阶级。如果离开了这种根本的革命力量，离开了工人阶级的领导，要完成反帝反封建的民主革命是不可能的。”
    同样，如果离开了工人阶级的领导，离开了工农这种根本的革命力量，进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，是不可能的；进行无产阶级文化大革命，也是不可能的。
    在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导下，我国工人阶级、贫农下中农以及由他们的子弟组成的人民解放军，从来就是我国革命和建设事业的主力军。他们同国内外强大的敌人，进行了长期的艰苦卓绝的斗争。压在我国人民头上的三座大山，是他们推翻的。我们无产阶级的天下，人民的天下，是他们打下来的。我们这个一穷二白的国家，这个被人瞧不起的落后的东方大国，也正是依靠广大工农兵群众勤劳的双手，依靠他们的勇敢和智慧，改变旧面貌，创造新奇迹，使我国在短暂的历史时期内，变成一个屹立在世界上的无产阶级铁打的江山。
    广大工农兵群众，在我国革命和建设的伟大事业中，建立了不朽的功勋。我们向工农兵致敬！
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国工人阶级和贫农下中农所肩负的任务，是光荣而繁重的。他们响应毛泽东同志和党中央的号召，一手抓革命，一手抓生产。他们既要斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把本单位的革命运动搞好；又要坚守自己的岗位，努力搞好工农业生产。
    进一步搞好工农业生产，是同无产阶级文化大革命的胜利前进，密切联系的。越是在文化革命高涨的形势下，越是在阶级斗争深入的情况下，就越要按照党中央十六条的要求，抓革命，促生产。
    今年是第三个五年计划的第一年。工农业生产形势很好，农业秋收丰产年景已定，完全可以实现工农业的大增产。这就要求，在最后的几个月里，所有工业、农业、交通运输、财经贸易、服务行业，以及其它各行各业的同志们，都应当付出紧张艰苦的劳动，力争超额完成党和国家交给的任务。
    生产是不能停下来的。工厂、农村的文化革命，应当按原来的“四清”运动部署结合进行。农村在秋收大忙的时候，可以把运动暂时停一下。大、中学校的红卫兵和革命师生，不必要到工厂、农村去进行革命串连，干预那里的部署。工人、贫农下中农是完全能够把本单位的革命运动搞好的。同时要指出，工人，公社社员，机关企业干部不能像大、中学校的学生那样放假，也不要到外地去进行革命串连。广大工农群众，应当把从文化革命和“四清”运动中激发出来的革命热情，用到生产劳动中去，促使各项工作做得更多，更快，更好，更省。
    很多工矿企业，很多农村人民公社，就是这样做的，做得非常好，很有成绩。在那里，工农群众的阶级觉悟大大提高，生产热情空前高涨。那里的出勤率增加了，产量增长了，质量提高了。全国一切工矿企业，一切农村人民公社，都应该努力向这样的先进单位看齐。
    人民解放军的干部战士们，应当坚守战斗岗位，大力突出政治，发扬三八作风，加强政治、军事训练。要保持高度警惕，高度戒备，随时准备迎击和粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶可能发动的突然进攻。
    我国广大工农兵群众，在长期的革命斗争中，同党结成了血肉联系，同毛主席心连心。他们最热爱毛主席，最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话。毛主席怎样说，他们就怎样做。他们在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，在无产阶级文化大革命的运动中，必将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，处处起模范作用，带头作用，为建设和保卫我们伟大的社会主义祖国，为支援世界人民的革命斗争，作出更大的贡献。
    毛泽东同志说：“许多东西单从书本上学是不成的，要向生产者学习，向工人学习，向贫农下中农学习”。他还号召“全国人民要向解放军学习”。
    毛泽东同志这个指示，对于大、中学校的红卫兵和革命学生来说，是很重要的。
    红卫兵和革命学生，在无产阶级文化大革命中，要以工农兵为榜样，虚心向工农兵学习。学习他们的勤劳和艰苦奋斗的作风，学习他们朴实和谦逊的作风，学习他们对敌人狠、对自己人和的革命品质，学习他们高度的组织性和纪律性，学习他们坚持真理、修正错误，勇于自我批评的革命风格。
    我们一定要在文化革命斗争的大风大浪中，把自己锻炼成为毛主席的好战士、好学生，成为永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
