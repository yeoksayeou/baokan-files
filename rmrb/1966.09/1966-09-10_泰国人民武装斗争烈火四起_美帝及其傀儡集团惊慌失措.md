	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on September 7, news from Bangkok: The U.S. imperialists are directly instructing the Thanom-Praphat clique in Thailand to intensify military deployments to suppress the Thai people's anti-American patriotic movement.

	According to a recent report by the American newspaper *Baltimore Sun*, the Thanom-Praphat clique has already dispatched three regiments of troops, divided into "combat groups," to the northeastern region, collaborating with the police to continuously conduct suppression activities in areas where the people's armed forces are active. To make up for the shortage of puppet troops, they also plan to increase the number of local police by 6,200. The Thai police have already been equipped with 17 helicopters for suppression activities and have recently ordered an additional 22.

	The Thanom-Praphat clique also plans to establish so-called "Joint Security Centers" in the northeastern region to collect intelligence, with each village setting up two-way radios for command and control of operations. This American newspaper admits that the Thanom puppet clique's plan to suppress the Thai people is not only funded and equipped by the U.S. government but is also carried out with the direct participation of American personnel. It states, "This plan will use up most of the $43 million from the U.S. aid program," and "A group of U.S. intelligence personnel provides intelligence to local Thai officials." According to reports, U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Graham Martin has urgently requested helicopters flown by U.S. Air Force personnel to deal with the people's armed forces.

	This American newspaper also admits that the suppression by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys has not been very effective. Another American newspaper, the *Washington Post*, also says that the armed struggle of the Thai people "is gradually expanding, which is undeniable."

	Since 1961, the Thai people have begun armed struggles against U.S. imperialism and its Thai lackeys. Now, the Thai people's armed forces are active in the vast northeastern and entire southern regions of Thailand, striking hard at the American invaders and Thanom's lackey troops, and continuously annihilating enemy forces of two to three hundred. The Patriotic Front of Thailand, which has united all patriotic forces in Thailand, pointed out in its New Year's message to the nation this year that as long as the Thai people unite and persist in the struggle, "U.S. imperialism and the Thanom fascist dictatorship traitor government will definitely perish."

    泰国人民武装斗争烈火四起
    美帝及其傀儡集团惊慌失措
    据新华社七日讯　曼谷消息：美帝国主义正直接指使泰国他侬—巴博集团加紧军事部署，来镇压泰国人民反美爱国运动。
    据美国《巴尔的摩太阳报》最近报道，他侬—巴博集团已经派出三个团的兵力分成“战斗小组”，驻扎在东北部地区，配合警察，不断到人民武装活动的地方进行镇压活动。为了弥补傀儡军队力量的不足，他们还计划增加六千二百名地方警察。泰国警察已经配备有十七架直升飞机来进行镇压活动，最近又订购了二十二架。
    他侬—巴博集团还计划在东北部地区成立所谓“联合治安中心”来收集情报，每一个村庄设立收发两用无线电，指挥作战活动。这家美国报纸承认，他侬傀儡集团镇压泰国人民的计划不仅由美国政府出钱、出装备，而且是在美国人员直接参加下进行的。它说，“这个计划将用掉美国援助计划四千三百万美元的大部分”，“美国情报人员中有一批人向泰国的地方官员提供情报”。据报道，美国驻泰国大使格雷姆·马丁曾紧急要求提供由美国空军人员驾驶的直升飞机，来对付人民武装。
    这家美国报纸还承认，美帝国主义及其走狗的镇压，没有取得多大效果。另一家美国报纸《华盛顿邮报》也说，泰国人民武装斗争“正在逐渐扩大，这是不可否认的。”
    从一九六一年以来，泰国人民就开始进行反对美帝国主义及其泰国走狗的武装斗争。现在，泰国人民武装正活跃在泰国广大的东北部和整个南部地区，痛打美国侵略者和他侬走狗的军队，并且接连歼灭两三百人一股的敌人。团结了泰国所有爱国力量的泰国爱国阵线在今年元旦告全国同胞书中指出，只要泰国人民团结一致、坚持斗争，“美帝国主义和（他侬）法西斯独裁叛国政府一定灭亡。”
