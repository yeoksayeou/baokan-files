Let the imperialists and their running dogs tremble!

In our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have carried forward the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion and launched a fierce offensive against the old world. Revolutionaries all over the world are jubilant and enthusiastically acclaim: "The Red Guards of China are the outstanding successors of the Chinese revolution and a powerful shock brigade of the world revolution!"

However, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries are trembling with fear. They gnash their teeth and attack our revolutionary youngsters as "belligerent," making people "feel terrified."

The Red Guards are "belligerent." Yes. For all revolutionaries, life is struggle. One must struggle against the heavens, struggle against the earth, and even more so struggle against imperialism and all ghosts and monsters. The reality of class struggle teaches us that we must not compromise or retreat in the face of imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries; we must put struggle first. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people have overthrown the three big mountains and established a socialist state. The oppressed peoples of the world are fighting, making the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs frantic and disheveled. The young Red Guards of China must join hands with revolutionary people all over the world to completely overthrow the imperialist system.

"Feel terrified." Indeed. The ghosts and monsters in China are connected at the hip with the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of the world. When the young Red Guards sweep away the ghosts and monsters at home, how can all reactionary forces in the world not feel terrified? Imperialism has always harbored the delusion that our country will change, placing their hopes on the second and third generations. Now, the young Red Guards have declared with revolutionary actions the solemn vow of the broad masses of Chinese youth: "To be red forever, generation after generation, red to the end!" The dream of imperialism to make our country undergo a "peaceful evolution" has been shattered, and it is natural for them to feel terrified.

Chairman Mao said: "What makes the enemy feel terrified is precisely what makes the revolutionary people feel joyous." Let the imperialists and their running dogs tremble! Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our young Red Guards will hold high the banner of revolutionary rebellion and thoroughly smash the old world to build a new world.

    让帝国主义及其走狗发抖吧！
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命中，红卫兵高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，向旧世界猛烈开火。全世界革命人民欢欣鼓舞，热烈欢呼：“中国的红卫兵是中国革命的优秀接班人，是世界革命强大的突击队！”
    但是，帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派却吓得胆颤心惊。他们咬牙切齿地攻击我们的革命小将“好斗”，使人“感到恐怖”。
    红卫兵“好斗”。是的。对于一切革命者来说，生活就是斗争。要与天斗，与地斗，更要与帝国主义和一切牛鬼蛇神斗。阶级斗争的现实教育我们，对于帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派决不能妥协退让，就是要斗字当头。中国人民在毛主席和共产党领导下，斗倒了三座大山，斗出了社会主义的江山。全世界被压迫人民正在斗得美帝国主义及其走狗焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。中国红卫兵小将们一定要同全世界革命人民一起，把帝国主义制度彻底斗垮。
    使人“感到恐怖”。不错。中国的牛鬼蛇神同世界上的帝修反穿的是连裆裤。红卫兵小将在国内横扫牛鬼蛇神，世界上一切反动势力怎能不感到恐怖呢？帝国主义一直妄想我国变天，把希望寄托在我国的第二代、第三代的身上。现在，红卫兵小将们用革命的实际行动宣布了中国广大青少年的庄严誓言：“要世世红，代代红，红到底！”帝国主义想使我国“和平演变”的梦幻灭了，他们感到恐怖是很自然的。
    毛主席说：敌人“感觉恐怖的事，正是革命的人民大众感觉高兴的事。”让帝国主义及其走狗发抖吧！我们的红卫兵小将在毛主席领导下，必将把革命造反精神的旗帜举得更高，彻底砸碎旧世界，建立新世界。
