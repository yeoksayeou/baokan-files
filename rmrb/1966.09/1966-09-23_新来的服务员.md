	The New Waiter

	In recent days, in the Xiangyang Street Workers' and Peasants' Restaurant in Chengdu, Sichuan, one can often see four young people wearing white aprons, serving customers patiently and enthusiastically, with quick movements, very much like excellent and experienced waiters.

	These four young people are Red Guards from Chengdu No. 18 Middle School. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Sixteen Points, Chengdu No. 18 Middle School established a broadcasting station on the upper floor of the Xiangyang Street Workers' and Peasants' Restaurant. The school's Red Guard headquarters sent them to serve as broadcasters. In addition to completing their work tasks every day, they also have some free time. Following Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, they decided to use their free time to help the restaurant workers with some tasks. Thus, they put on aprons and started working as waiters.

	These revolutionary youngsters do not fear dirt, fatigue, or hardship in their labor. They carry dishes, wash bowls, wipe tables, and sweep the floor, eagerly taking on any task. They see workers and peasants enter the restaurant and enthusiastically greet them to sit down. After asking what dishes they want, they promptly serve the food and dishes, striving to minimize the time workers and peasants spend waiting.

	The enthusiastic service spirit of these four Red Guard youngsters has been widely praised, with people saying they are truly good Red Guards of Chairman Mao.

    新来的服务员
    近几天来，在四川成都向阳街工农食堂里，经常可以看到有四个小青年，拴着白围腰，接待顾客耐心、热情，动作迅速，很像是优秀、熟练的服务员。
    这四个青年，是成都市十八中学的红卫兵。为了向群众宣传毛泽东思想，宣传十六条，十八中学在向阳街工农食堂楼上设立了一个广播站，学校红卫兵总部派他们担任广播员。每天在完成工作任务之外，还有一些空闲时间。他们按照毛主席的“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，决定利用空闲时间，帮助食堂职工做一些工作。于是就拴上围腰，当起服务员来了。
    这几个革命小将，在劳动中不怕脏、不怕累、不怕苦，端菜、洗碗、抹桌、扫地，什么活儿都争着干。他们见工农群众一进食堂，就热情地招呼坐下，问明吃啥饭菜后，毫不迟延地端菜送饭，尽量使工农群众少耽误时间。
    这四位红卫兵小将热心服务的精神，受到了人们的普遍赞扬，说他们真是毛主席的好红卫兵。
