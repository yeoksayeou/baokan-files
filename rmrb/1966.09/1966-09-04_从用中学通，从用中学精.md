	From Practice, Learn and Master

	Deputy Squad Leader Zhang Wen Kui

	I began studying "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" in 1963. However, at that time, I only studied without applying what I learned. Although I had studied "On Contradiction," when I encountered contradictions in practice, I still did not know how to resolve them. At that time, my platoon leader, Comrade Chen Jin Yuan, pointed out the shortcomings in my study and guided me to learn two quotations from Chairman Mao. One is: "Reading is learning, using is also learning, and it is more important learning." The other is: "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it; the purpose of mastery is entirely for application." After repeatedly studying these, I felt they were correct. If one only studies without applying, isn't that becoming the kind of person Chairman Mao criticized, who only shouts "Good arrow! Good arrow!" but never shoots it? Afterwards, I followed Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on studying with problems in mind and applying actively. I learned a little and used a little, achieving good results. I learned about grasping the main contradiction and paid attention to mastering shooting techniques, quickly improving my shooting scores; I learned about the method of one divides into two and used it to improve management and education, overcoming the problem of rigidity. Afterwards, the more I studied, the more I wanted to apply, and the more I applied, the more flexible I became.

	This year, during construction, the company appointed me as the supply officer. At the beginning, I encountered the contradiction of tools being "insufficient." The number of tools supplied by higher authorities according to the plan was far from the actual number of tools reported as scrapped. Initially, I thought it was difficult to solve. With this problem in mind, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "On Contradiction" again. I realized that my supply work had contradictions with both receiving and issuing, and the main aspect of the contradiction lay on my side. My work involves "preserving" and "managing." However, preserving is not just about preserving tools; it means ensuring no wastage to higher authorities and ensuring supply to lower levels. If I truly did a good job in preserving and managing, the contradictions in receiving and issuing could be solved. Therefore, I went deep into the field, finding the causes of excessive tool scrapping from both ideological and technical aspects. I studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with everyone, operated together, repaired tools, and improved tools. Finally, the tool scrapping rate was reduced by seventy percent. The contradictions in receiving and issuing were also resolved.

	I deeply feel that studying Chairman Mao's works is about learning while applying and applying while learning; mastering through application and becoming proficient through practice. Mao Zedong Thought contains limitless spiritual atomic energy. Only through active learning and application can this energy be released; only through active learning and application can Mao Zedong Thought be transformed into a great material force.

    从用中学通，从用中学精
    副班长　张文奎
    我从一九六三年开始学习《实践论》、《矛盾论》。但是，那时我光学不用。虽然学习了《矛盾论》，但在实践中遇到一些矛盾，还是不知怎样解决。当时的指导员陈金元同志针对我学习上存在的缺点，指导我学习毛主席的两条语录。一条是：“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”一条是：“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”我反复学了以后，觉得很对。光学不用，不是成了毛主席批评的只会叫“好箭！好箭！”却老是不射出去的那种人了吗？以后，我按照毛主席的教导和林彪副主席关于带着问题学，活学活用的指示去做，学一点，就用一点，收到了很好的效果。我学了要抓主要矛盾，就注意摸射击要领，射击的成绩提高很快；学了一分为二，就用来改进管理教育，克服了简单生硬的毛病。以后，我越学越爱用，越用越灵活。
    今年，搞施工，连里叫我当保管员。一开始就遇到了工具“入不敷出”的矛盾。上级按计划补发的数量，和下面实际报废的数字相差很大。起初，我认为不好解决。带着这个问题，我又学习了《为人民服务》和《矛盾论》。认识到我这个保管工作，同领和发都有矛盾，而矛盾的主要方面就在我这一方。我的工作是“保”和“管”两个字。但是，保，不单单是保管工具，对上说要保证不浪费，对下说要保证供得上。如果我真正把保管工作作好了，领和发的矛盾就可能解决。于是我深入现场，从思想上和技术上找工具报废过多的原因。我同大家一起学习《毛主席语录》，一起操作，一起修理工具、改进工具，终于使工具的报废率降低了百分之七十。领和发的矛盾也解决了。
    我深深体会到：学习毛主席著作，就是要在学中用，在用中学；从用中学通，从用中学精。毛泽东思想蕴藏着无限的精神原子能，只有靠活学活用，才能激发出其中的能量；也只有靠活学活用，才能把毛泽东思想变为巨大的物质力量。
