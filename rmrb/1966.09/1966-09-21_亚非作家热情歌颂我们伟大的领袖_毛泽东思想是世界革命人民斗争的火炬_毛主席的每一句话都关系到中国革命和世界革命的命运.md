	Tanzanian representative Yahya Muhammad Hassan said, "To achieve victory in all revolutionary struggles, one must use Chairman Mao's thoughts." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guiding light for the Chinese people's victory but also the guiding light for the victory of the people of all countries. Mao Zedong Thought not only illuminates the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers but also far exceeds the borders of China, illuminating the broad masses of laboring people around the world. Anyone, whether in China or elsewhere, who is armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely achieve victory, and any struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought will surely achieve victory."

	Tanzanian representative Muhammad Ali Hamadi said, "The great revolutionary leader of the world, Chairman Mao's thoughts, have greatly inspired all of us. In my view, to achieve victory in all revolutionary struggles, one must use Chairman Mao's thoughts. The people of Tanzania are learning Chairman Mao's works, and we want to learn the experience of the Chinese people in this regard."

	Mao Zedong Thought Is a Powerful Weapon for Revolutionary People

	Malayan writer Sharma said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism in the new era when the Chinese people must carry the revolution to the end and when the people of the world must wage fierce struggles in various forms against imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries, as well as against modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership and various brands."

	Congolese (Leopoldville) representative Kibwe Constantine said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the torch for the struggle of the proletariat and all oppressed peoples of the world, illuminating the path of struggle for the people of various countries. For the Congolese (Leopoldville) people who are waging a revolutionary struggle, it is an extremely powerful weapon." He emphasized, "Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest stage of the development of Marxism-Leninism and the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

	We Must Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought

	Laotian representative Xalan Ounsan said enthusiastically in praise of the great Mao Zedong Thought, "No one can deny that Mao Zedong Thought is the most thorough and steadfast revolutionary thought, the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people, the only correct thought for guiding all revolutions and construction, and the highest pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the revolutionary thought of the Chinese people but also the revolutionary thought of the people of the world. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the entire world. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought has made China the center of world revolution." Xalan Ounsan emphasized, "The form of revolution adopted by the revolutionary people of Laos since the end of 1946, surrounding the cities from the countryside, this theory comes from Mao Zedong Thought."

	Mao Zedong Thought Belongs to All Progressive Humanity

	Somali Coast ("French") representative Muhammad Dahan said, "Mao Zedong Thought is an effective weapon for the liberation of the oppressed peoples of the world." He said, "Great thoughts have no borders. The thoughts of Marx and Engels do not belong only to Germany, and the great thoughts of Lenin and Stalin do not belong only to Russia. Similarly, Mao Zedong's revolutionary thoughts do not belong only to China but to all progressive humanity."

	He said that every word of Chairman Mao is very precious, and every word relates to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Chairman Mao has been engaged in revolutionary activities to transform the entire Chinese society since his youth, making China the cradle of the world revolution.

Mao Zedong Thought is not only the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution but also the combination of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought not only summarizes the experience of the Chinese revolution but also summarizes the experience of the world revolution. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought has become the pinnacle and the highest and most living Marxism-Leninism."

	Salah Dahhan said, "For us, the revolutionary people of the world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Mao Zedong Thought is the torch that will ignite the fire to burn imperialism, old and new colonialism, and modern revisionism."

    毛泽东思想是世界革命人民斗争的火炬
    毛主席的每一句话都关系到中国革命和世界革命的命运
    据新华社讯　参加在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议的许多国家和地区的代表，在不久前离开我国时，纷纷向本社记者发表访华观感，热情地称颂我们的伟大领袖毛主席是活的马克思、活的列宁，热情地赞扬毛泽东思想是全世界革命人民，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲革命人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义的指路明灯。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来就能胜利
    坦桑尼亚代表叶海雅·穆罕默德·哈桑尼说：“要取得一切革命斗争的胜利，就必须运用毛主席的思想。”他说：“毛泽东思想不但是中国人民取得胜利的指路明灯，而且也是世界各国人民取得胜利的指路明灯。毛泽东思想不但照亮了中国工农兵，而且远远超越了中国边界，照亮了世界上的广大劳动人民。任何人，不论在中国或在别的地方，只要是用毛泽东思想武装起来，就一定能取得胜利，任何在毛泽东思想指导下的斗争也一定能够胜利。”
    坦桑尼亚代表穆罕默德·阿里·赫迈迪说：“世界伟大革命领袖毛主席的思想给我们所有的人很大鼓舞。在我看来，要取得所有革命斗争的胜利，就必须运用毛主席的思想。我们坦桑尼亚人民正在学习毛主席的著作，我们要学习中国人民在这方面的经验。”
    毛泽东思想是革命人民的强大武器
    马来亚作家沙尔玛说：“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。毛泽东思想是在中国人民要把革命进行到底和全世界人民为了反对以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派，以及反对以苏联领导集团为首的各种牌号的现代修正主义需要用各种形式开展激烈斗争的新时代的最高最活的马克思列宁主义。”
    刚果（利）代表基布韦·康士坦丁说：“毛泽东思想是全世界无产者和一切被压迫人民斗争的火炬，它照亮了各国人民斗争的道路。毛泽东思想对于正在进行革命斗争的刚果（利）人民来说，是一个极其强大的武器。”他强调指出：“毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的最高阶段，是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。”
    一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗
    老挝代表扎伦·翁桑昂热情颂扬伟大的毛泽东思想说：“谁也否认不了毛泽东思想是最彻底、最坚定的革命思想，是全心全意为人民服务的思想，是指导一切革命和建设的唯一正确的思想，是当代马克思列宁主义的最高顶峰。毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民的革命思想，也是全世界人民的革命思想。毛泽东思想的光辉照亮着全世界。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。”他说：“毛泽东思想已经使中国成为全世界革命的中心。”扎伦·翁桑昂强调指出：“老挝革命人民自一九四六年年底以来所采取的农村包围城市的革命形式，这个理论就是来自于毛泽东思想。”
    毛泽东思想属于整个进步人类
    索马里海岸（“法属”）代表穆罕默德·达汗说：“毛泽东思想是世界被压迫人民求解放行之有效的武器。”他说：“伟大的思想是没有国界的。马克思和恩格斯的思想不仅仅属于德国，列宁和斯大林的伟大思想也不仅仅属于俄国。同样，毛泽东的革命思想不仅属于中国，而且属于整个进步人类。”
    他说，毛主席的每一句话都是很宝贵的，每一句话都关系到中国革命和世界革命。毛主席从青年时代就从事改造整个中国社会的革命活动，使中国成为世界革命的摇篮。
    达汗说：他所见到的一切使他深信，“毛泽东主席的革命思想在中国，在世界，特别在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，正在一天天地赢得胜利。”
    毛主席向世界人民指出革命的道路
    北加里曼丹代表文铭权说，他深深体会到“毛泽东是中国人民最伟大的领袖，是活的马克思、活的列宁，是世界革命人民的灯塔。是毛泽东带领中国人民赤手空拳打出一个社会主义的新中国来，是毛泽东把马克思列宁主义发展到目前的最高峰，是毛泽东向世界人民指出了革命的道路。”
    斯威士兰代表阿尔贝·恩修马洛说：“毛泽东主席是当代活着的马克思和列宁。我们完全相信，遵循毛主席的思想办事，被压迫人民就没有办不到的事情。”
    毛泽东思想总结了世界革命的经验
    也门代表萨利赫·达汉说：“毛泽东思想是今天中国的每一个运动的生命线和脊骨。毛泽东思想不仅是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践的结合，而且是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同世界革命的具体实践的结合。毛泽东思想不仅总结了中国革命的经验，而且总结了世界革命的经验。因此，毛泽东思想已经成为马克思列宁主义的顶峰和最高最活的马克思列宁主义。”
    萨利赫·达汉说：“对我们全世界革命人民，特别是亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民来说，毛泽东思想是火炬，它将使我们点燃焚烧帝国主义、新老殖民主义以及现代修正主义之火。”
    毛主席是世界人民的救星
    叙利亚代表扎达特·里卡比说：“我感到中国人民对他们的领袖毛主席的深刻的热爱是无法形容的。他们把毛主席看做是把人民从黑暗中解救出来的救星。”里卡比说：“毛主席为了建设一个伟大的独立的新中国而长期地艰苦奋斗，他为在平等基础上建设世界而斗争着，他反对各种形式的帝国主义。毛主席是中国人民的伟大领袖和救星，也是世界人民的救星。”
    尼泊尔代表戈温达·巴塔说：“亚非作家认为，毛泽东思想是当代革命思想的最高形式。学习和运用毛主席著作，肯定将给他们的革命斗争带来成果和胜利。”
