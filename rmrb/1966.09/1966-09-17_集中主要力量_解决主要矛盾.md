Chief of Staff Fan Tian'en said: War is the continuation of politics. The U.S. imperialists are invading everywhere, committing all sorts of evil deeds, and are now transferring troops from Europe to our surroundings. The strategy of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one" is not only applicable to the past, but also to the present and future; not only to our revolutionary wars, but also to revolutionary wars around the world. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in "Long Live the Victory of People's War": "This U.S. imperialist giant can also be divided and defeated. The peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions, you strike its head, I strike its feet, and we will eat it up bit by bit, and annihilate it part by part." This is precisely the broad application and development of the thought of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one."

Political Instructor Gao Runtian said: In Korea, we have already clashed with U.S. imperialism. As a conventional war, it was already a large-scale one. The enemy used everything except atomic bombs—airplanes, cannons, tanks, warships, bacteria, and poison gas. However, by applying Chairman Mao's strategy, together with the Korean people, we defeated the U.S. aggressors thoroughly. In the second campaign, the heavily armed U.S. aggressors madly advanced northward. Our army, following Chairman Mao's instructions, lured the enemy deep into our territory, causing their forces to disperse. Subsequently, we concentrated superior forces to encircle and annihilate, first targeting those far from the main force, poorly equipped, and operating in mountainous areas, such as the fake 7th and 8th divisions. Then, our army cut off the retreat route of the U.S. main force at Samsu-ri and Chosin Lake, engaging in close combat, rendering their heavy weapons ineffective, and annihilating a large number of them, pushing the enemy back across the 38th parallel. The facts have proven that the principle of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one" is the key to defeating U.S. imperialism.

Deputy Commander Liu Haicheng said: Chairman Mao's thought of "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one" is a winning strategy on the battlefield and a guarantee for completing various tasks in peacetime. In work, one must be good at grasping the main contradictions, concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles, and resolving major contradictions. This way, the overall work can be advanced. If one disperses forces and tries to handle everything at once, the work will become mediocre.

During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed: Chairman Mao's brilliant thought not only has great practical significance but is also a universal truth applicable everywhere. When applied on the battlefield, it leads to victory; when applied in revolutionary work, it achieves excellent results. By learning and applying it, we can accelerate the progress of our country's socialist revolution and the world proletarian revolution!

    集中主要力量  解决主要矛盾
    军参谋长范天恩说：战争是政治的继续。美帝国主义到处侵略，做尽了坏事，现在正从欧洲向我国周围调兵。“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的战法，不仅适用于过去，也适用于现在和将来；不仅适用于我国的革命战争，而且适用于全世界的革命战争。林彪同志在《人民战争胜利万岁》一文中指出：“美帝国主义这个庞然大物，也是可以分割的，是可以分割开来打败它的。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和其他地区的人民，你打它的头，我打它的脚，一口一口地吃掉它，一部分一部分地消灭它。”这正是
  “集中优势兵力、各个歼灭敌人”这一思想的广泛应用和发展。
    政治教导员高润田说：在朝鲜，我们已经和美帝国主义交过手。作为常规战争，那已经是够大的一次战争。敌人除原子弹外，飞机、大炮、坦克、军舰、细菌、毒气都使用了。可是我们运用毛主席的这一战法，和朝鲜人民一起，把美国侵略者打得落花流水。在第二次战役中，武装到牙齿的美国侵略军疯狂地向北进犯，我军按照毛主席的教导，诱敌深入，使敌人兵力分散。随后，我们集中优势兵力迂回包围，首先分别歼灭那些远离主力、装备差、活动在山区的伪七、八两师。接着，我军又在三所里和长津湖切断美军主力的退路，短兵相接，使敌人重火器基本失去作用，将其大量歼灭，一下子把敌人打过了三八线。事实证明：“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的原则，是战胜美帝国主义的法宝。
    副军长刘海清说：毛主席“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的思想，在战场上是克敌制胜的法宝，在平时也是完成各项任务的法宝。在工作中，就是要善于抓住主要矛盾，集中力量打歼灭战，解决主要矛盾，这样才能推动全盘工作的前进。分兵把口，眉毛胡须一把抓，工作就一般化。

    在座谈中，大家一致认为：毛主席这一光辉思想不仅有着伟大的现实意义，而且是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。用在战场上，就能打胜仗；用在革命工作中，就能做出很好的成绩。学好它，用好它，就能加速我国的社会主义革命和无产阶级世界革命的进程！
