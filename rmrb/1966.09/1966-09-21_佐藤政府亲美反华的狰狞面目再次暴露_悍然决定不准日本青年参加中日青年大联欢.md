The savage face of the Sato government's pro-American, anti-China stance is exposed again. The Sato government has brazenly decided not to issue passports to more than 600 Japanese youths applying to go to China to participate in the second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival.

New China News Agency, September 20: Tokyo reports that according to the Japanese Kyodo News Agency, the Sato government of Japan decided on September 20 to refuse to issue passports to all more than 600 Japanese youths who applied to go to China to participate in the second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. This once again exposes the savage anti-China face of the Sato government.

Japanese Cabinet Secretary (Chief Secretary) Aichi Keiichi, after the cabinet meeting, could only stammer in his explanation to the press for the Sato government's heinous behavior.

According to the Kyodo News Agency, by September 20, 639 people had applied for passports to participate in this Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. They are resolutely fighting to break through the obstacles set by the Sato government to come to China to participate in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival.

Except for the various followers of Soviet revisionism, various circles in Japan and famous figures in the cultural world who are enthusiastic about Sino-Japanese friendship have given enthusiastic support to the struggle of Japanese youths to go to China to participate in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival.

    佐藤政府亲美反华的狰狞面目再次暴露
    悍然决定不准日本青年参加中日青年大联欢
    新华社二十日讯　东京消息：据日本共同社报道，日本佐藤政府二十日悍然决定拒绝发给申请到中国参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢的全部六百多名日本青年的护照。这再一次暴露了佐藤政府反华的狰狞面目。
    日本内阁官房长官（秘书长）爱知揆一在内阁会议后向新闻记者发表谈话时，只能语无伦次地为佐藤政府的这种丧心病狂的行为辩解。
    据共同社报道，截至二十日，申请发给护照去参加这届中日青年友好大联欢的有六百三十九人。他们正在为彻底冲破佐藤政府设置的障碍到中国来参加中日青年友好大联欢而进行着坚决的斗争。
    除苏联修正主义的形形色色的追随者以外，日本热心于日中友好的各界人士和文化界知名人士，都对日本青年为到中国参加中日青年友好大联欢而进行的斗争给予热烈的声援。
