Editor's Note: The experience of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country has proven that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and infusing Mao Zedong Thought into the minds of workers and peasants, can transform people's spiritual outlook and turn spiritual strength into tremendous material force. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest and most intelligent. They dare to think, dare to act, and dare to innovate; at the same time, they are good at investigation and research, and master the laws of development of things. In the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, they can overcome numerous difficulties and achieve one victory after another. The articles published in today's issue fully illustrate this point. Chairman Mao said, "The masses have boundless enthusiasm for socialism." By arming people with Mao Zedong Thought, this enthusiasm will be fully unleashed. By arming people with Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely be able to build socialism quickly, efficiently, and economically, and definitely be able to build our country into an invincible iron fortress!

Mao Zedong Thought Guides Everything and Transforms Everything
People Change, Land Changes, Rivers and Mountains Change

The glorious national day of the Chinese people—the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China—is approaching. There are countless words to express my boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao. In the old society, I was a beggar's child. During the founding ceremony, I was only thirteen years old. This year, I am responsible for leading a county. My growth and progress are entirely due to Mao Zedong Thought.

I was transferred to the county committee in January this year. From being the secretary of a brigade party branch to suddenly becoming the county committee secretary. Can I shoulder the heavy responsibility given to me by the Party? At first, I was afraid that I might not do a good job and cause losses to the Party. However, as long as I seriously study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. Therefore, I brought my questions and repeatedly studied "The Working Method of Party Committees." Chairman Mao said, "To fulfill its leadership tasks, the Party committee must rely on this 'team' and give full play to their roles. The secretary should be a good 'captain' and should study and research well." Based on Chairman Mao's instructions, as soon as I arrived at the county committee, I adopted a learning attitude and had separate talks with the six standing committee members. I also actively visited all the county committee members, listened carefully to everyone's opinions, humbly sought advice from everyone, familiarized myself with the situation, and studied the work.

The county committee has a lot of work. What should be prioritized? From the discussions, everyone unanimously agreed that the most urgent task is to organize the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. To organize the masses to study Chairman Mao's works well, the leadership must take the lead in studying and applying them well. Therefore, the county committee leadership must truly prioritize the study of Chairman Mao's works in all work, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything. In addition to studying Chairman Mao's works, we also studied the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu. Through learning, self-reflection, identifying gaps, and finding root causes, we further raised everyone's awareness of serving the people. The standing committee members all went to the countryside, each carrying Chairman Mao's works and production tools, working and studying with the masses. This set a good example for promoting the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works throughout the county, promoting the ideological transformation of cadres and the masses.

People's thoughts have changed, urgently demanding to quickly transform the sky and land of Glan County, to make greater contributions to supporting socialist construction and supporting the world people's revolution. The county committee is determined to realize the people's demands. But where to start? Chairman Mao said, "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." Based on Chairman Mao's instructions, we took Lankao as a mirror, first conducted investigations and research, understood the situation, and seriously summarized historical experiences and lessons. Then, we formulated a feasible plan to change the sky and land. In the investigation and research work, leading cadres took the lead in climbing mountains and crossing rivers, conducting on-site inspections, and visiting the masses, determined to "master" nature. Every mountain and riverbank in the county were left with the footprints of comrades. County committee member and deputy county magistrate Ma Yucheng, who is already over fifty, suffers from lung disease, stomach disease, and arthritis. The county committee, considering his health, called him back from the commune to rest and work. However, after studying Chairman Mao's works, he strictly required himself everywhere, taking White as a mirror. He led a research team, traversing all six valleys, thirty-two ridges, and over a hundred gullies in the county, investigating water resources. Through on-site investigations, the county committee re-recognized Glan County and formulated a five-year production construction plan centered on "four modernizations" (irrigation, mechanization, electrification, and greening).

After the plan to transform the face of Glan County was formulated, the county mobilized three-quarters of the county-level government cadres, hoisting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, going deep into the front lines of agriculture, setting up networks and points, promoting the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works from point to surface, and promoting class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, comprehensively promoting the work experience of Dazhai and Nangli Party branches.

Because we grasped the fundamental study of Chairman Mao's works, people are changing, land is changing, rivers and mountains are changing, everything is changing. The work is unprecedentedly lively. The great power of Mao Zedong Thought is already and will continue to play a great role in transforming society, transforming thoughts, transforming nature, and transforming everything. The Donghe Water Brigade's Deng Hailian, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, actively participated in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. In just two years, she successfully created the experience of changing the staggered sowing of male and female parents to simultaneous sowing in corn hybrid breeding, solving a problem that domestic and foreign corn experts had not been able to solve for many years. The workers of Nanfang Cooperative Factory, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, dared to think, dare to do, dare to innovate, and dared to revolutionize, creating triple pumps and deep-well pumps that can vertically lift water to a height of 200 meters and vertically lift water to a depth of 150 meters. Glan County has long been known for the folk song, "Glan County is a great drought, with high mountains, thin soil, and lack of water fields." However, after the wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works swept across the entire county, the people of the county were full of spirit and fighting spirit, cutting mountains to open canals, digging wells to find springs. In just a few months, a total of 106 water conservancy projects were completed, and the newly developed water fields were more than four times the historical water field area. Water conservancy projects are like this, and other work is also like this. This spring, 1,430,000 trees were planted, 2,400 mu of seedlings were raised, and the greening of roads reached more than 1,600 li. Many facts fully prove that once Mao Zedong Thought arms the broad masses, it will become an immeasurable material force. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the smartest and bravest, the greatest fighting force, and the greatest productive force.

In the future, we will hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, together with the people of the entire county, to build a new socialist Glan County, support national socialist construction, and support the revolutionary struggle of the world's people, contributing everything.

### 毛泽东思想统帅一切改造一切  人在变，地在变，山河在变

专栏：

    编者按：我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验证明，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，就可以改变人的精神面貌，使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢、最聪明。他们敢想敢干敢闯，敢于破旧立新；同时又善于调查研究，掌握事物发展规律。在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，就能够克服重重困难，取得一个又一个的胜利。今天本版刊登的几篇文章，充分说明了这一点。毛主席说：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”用毛泽东思想武装人们的头脑，这种积极性就会无限地发挥出来。用毛泽东思想武装人们的头脑，我们就一定能够多快好省地建设社会主义，一定能够把我们的国家建设成为无比强大的铁打江山！
    毛泽东思想统帅一切改造一切
    人在变，地在变，山河在变
    我国人民光辉的节日——中华人民共和国成立十七周年就要到来了，千言万语说不尽我对党和毛主席的无限热爱心情。在旧社会我是个讨饭的苦孩子，开国大典的时候我才十三岁，今年却担负着一个县的领导工作。我的成长和进步，完全是靠的毛泽东思想。
    我是今年一月份调到县委工作的。从一个大队支部书记一下子担任县委书记。我能担起党交给我的这副重担子吗？开始，生怕工作搞不好，给党造成损失。可是，只要认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，就没有克服不了的困难。于是我就带着问题，反复学习了《党委会的工作方法》。毛主席说：“党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这‘一班人’，充分发挥他们的作用。书记要当好‘班长’，就应该很好地学习和研究。”我就根据毛主席的这一指示，一到县委，就本着学习的态度先同六个常委分别进行了交谈，并主动地访问了所有的县委委员，认真地听取大家的意见，虚心向大家请教，熟悉情况，研究工作。
    县委工作很多，究竟应该先抓什么？从交谈的情况中，大家一致认为：千紧万紧，最当紧的是组织群众活学活用毛主席著作。而要组织群众学好毛主席著作，领导就必须带头学好用好。因此，县委领导必须真正地把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，推动一切，改造一切。我们除了学习毛主席著作以外，还学习了焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹。通过学习，照镜子，找差距，挖根子，进一步提高了大家为人民服务的自觉性。常委人人下乡，都带着毛主席著作和生产工具，同群众一块儿劳动，一块儿学习。这样一来，就为推动全县干部、群众学习毛主席著作树立了良好的榜样，迅速掀起了学习毛主席著作群众运动，促进了干部、群众的思想革命化。
    人们的思想变了，迫切要求迅速改绛县之天，变绛县之地，对支援社会主义建设，支援世界人民革命作出更大的贡献。县委决心实现群众的要求。可是从哪里下手呢？毛主席说：“没有调查就没有发言权”。我们根据毛主席的指示，以兰考为镜子，首先进行调查研究，摸透情况，认真总结历史经验教训，然后制定一个切实可行的改天换地规划。在调查研究工作中，领导干部带头爬山越岭，涉水过沟，实地勘察，访问群众，决心“吃透”大自然。全县每个山头，每道河岸，都留下了同志们的脚印。县委委员、副县长马玉辰同志，已经五十多岁了，患有肺病、胃病、关节炎。县委为了照顾他的身体，把他从公社调回来，叫他边休息边工作。但是他学习了毛主席著作后，处处以白求恩为镜子，严格要求自己。他带了一个调查班子，跑遍了全县六条峪，三十二道岭，一百多条沟，查清了水利资源。通过实地调查，县委重新认识了绛县，制定了以“四化”（水利化、机械化、电气化、绿化）为中心的五年生产建设规划。
    改变绛县面貌的规划制定以后，全县抽调了四分之三的县级机关干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入农业第一线，撒网布点，以点带面大搞学习毛主席著作群众运动，大搞阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，全面推广大寨和南柳党支部工作经验。
    由于我们抓住了学习毛主席著作这个根本的根本，人在变，地在变，山河在变，一切在变。整个工作空前活跃。毛泽东思想的巨大威力，已经和正在发挥着改造社会，改造思想，改造自然，改造一切的伟大作用。东贺水大队耿海莲，活学活用毛主席著作，积极参加阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，只用了两年时间，就在玉米双交种培育方面，成功地创造出改父本母本分期播种为同期播种的经验，把国内外许多玉米专家多年来没有解决的问题解决了。南樊合作工厂的职工用伟大的毛泽东思想武装了头脑，敢想敢干，敢闯敢创，敢革命，创造了三联泵和深井泵，可以垂直扬高二百米和垂直提程一百五十米。绛县自古流传着“绛县是个大旱垣，山高土薄缺水田”的民谣。而当全县人民活学活用毛主席著作的高潮掀起之后，全县人民意气风发，斗志昂扬，劈山开渠，打井挖泉，在短短的几个月时间内，共完成水利工程一百零六项，新发展水地相当于有史以来水地面积的四倍多。水利工程是这样，其他工作也是这样。今年春天，就植树一百四十三万株，育苗二千四百亩，绿化道路长达一千六百多华里。许多事实充分证明，毛泽东思想一旦武装了广大群众，就会变成不可估量的物质力量。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最聪明、最勇敢，是最大的战斗力，是最大的生产力。
    今后，我们要更高更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，同全县人民一道，为建设社会主义的新绛县，支援国家社会主义建设，支援世界人民的革命斗争，贡献出一切。
