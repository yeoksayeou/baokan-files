Chairman Mao said: "The central task and highest form of revolution is the armed seizure of power, solving problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally applicable."

In their struggle, the people of Latin America are increasingly recognizing that armed struggle is the only path to true independence and liberation. Over the past few years, the armed struggles waged by the people of Latin America have either continued steadfastly or undergone adjustments to better resume the fight on new foundations. The patriotic guerrilla forces in Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, and Guatemala have all made new progress this year.

Through the practice of armed struggle, revolutionaries in Latin America have gradually come to understand that armed struggle must be conducted under the firm leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party and that guerrilla bases must be established in rural areas to encircle cities, waging a people's war.

The anti-American armed struggle of the Dominican people last April, which shocked the world, has had an extremely profound impact on Latin America. Since the beginning of this year, from Mexico in the north to Argentina in the south, the anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles of the people of the entire Latin America have flourished.

In March, the people of Ecuador launched a massive anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggle, and in just ten days, they toppled the U.S.-backed regime of Hijo. The anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles of the people of Argentina and Brazil are surging, continually challenging the dictatorial regimes that the United States has meticulously nurtured in these countries. The people of Panama held large-scale demonstrations to reclaim the canal zone seized by the United States. (Accompanying picture)

    反美风暴席卷拉丁美洲
    毛主席说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    拉丁美洲人民在斗争中，越来越认识到，武装斗争是取得真正独立和解放的唯一道路。拉丁美洲人民几年来开展的武装斗争，有的在坚持进行，有的在进行调整，以便在新的基础上更好地展开斗争。委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、秘鲁和危地马拉等国家的爱国游击队，今年来都不断取得新的进展。
    拉丁美洲的革命者在武装斗争的实践中逐步认识到，武装斗争必须在马克思列宁主义政党的坚强领导下进行，必须在农村开辟游击根据地，以农村包围城市，进行人民战争。
    多米尼加人民去年四月震动全世界的反美武装斗争，在拉丁美洲产生了极其深远的影响。今年以来，从北边的墨西哥一直到南面的阿根廷，整个拉丁美洲人民反美反独裁的斗争蓬勃发展。
    在三月间，厄瓜多尔人民开展了声势浩大的反美反独裁斗争，仅仅十天功夫，就把美国撑腰的希洪政权冲垮了。阿根廷和巴西人民的反美反独裁的斗争日益高涨，不断冲击着美国在这些国家精心扶植的独裁政权。巴拿马人民为收回美国强占的运河区举行了大规模示威游行。（附图片）
