The Red Guards of Beijing Girls' Second Middle School have been the most attentive to Chairman Mao's words during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. While they have been sweeping away all ghosts and monsters and destroying the old to establish the new, they have also paid attention to transforming their subjective world. They have combined their struggle with the need for learning, timely studying Chairman Mao's works such as "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Oppose Liberalism," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Moving the Mountains." They have examined and summarized the experiences of their previous struggles. This has made their ranks more orderly, their thoughts more unified, and their steps more in sync, making their revolutionary actions more in line with Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies.

To defeat the enemy, one must understand the enemy.

"Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party." The Red Guards defend Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's line and policies. Every word and action of the Red Guards should be in line with Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's line and policies.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution should be conducted through ideological struggle, not through physical combat. At the beginning, some students did not fully understand the profound significance of this policy and had doubts about it. They said: How can class struggle be so "gentle"? Should we follow the Party's policy or let personal feelings replace the Party's policy? Everyone studied Chairman Mao's words: "Only when the Party's policy and strategy are fully on the right track will the Chinese revolution have the possibility of victory. Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party... one must never be careless." Everyone agreed that the Party's line and policies concentrate the class interests of the proletariat. The Party's policies have a clear class nature. Executing the Party's policies is to safeguard the interests of the Party and the proletariat, and it is a concentrated expression of clear class feelings of love and hate. The Red Guards must take the Party's policies as the criterion. They must resolutely carry out what is in line with the Party's policies and resolutely not do what goes against the Party's policies. Only in this way can we become Chairman Mao's Red Guards and always be full of vigor and invincible.

Some people proposed: "Only through physical combat can the enemy truly bow down." How should this problem be answered? They seriously studied the editorial "Use Ideological Struggle, Not Physical Combat" from the People's Daily. During the study, they paid attention to comparing it with the practical experience of the previous stage of struggle, analyzing where the enemy was bad, and how to truly defeat, smash, and expose the enemy. Everyone agreed that the enemy is bad in their souls, so they are most afraid of exposing their dirty souls. Physical combat can only affect the surface, not the soul. Only through ideological struggle, exposing the enemy's ugly face in broad daylight, can we defeat the enemy and thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism.

Understanding the truth and clarifying the thoughts, the Red Guards unanimously expressed: We must unconditionally implement the Party's policies and make the revolutionary movement advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. We must make the revolution together with the masses.

The Red Guards of Beijing Girls' Second Middle School rebelled against the bourgeoisie and swept away the old in society, but they did not pay attention to organizing other revolutionary students to participate at the beginning. For a period of time, the Red Guards were extremely busy making the revolution, with some students not sleeping day or night. However, other students could not participate.

During the study, some students affirmed the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Red Guards but also raised some criticisms. They said: Making the revolution, you are at the forefront, but we also have a revolutionary heart! Let us advance together in the great waves of class struggle.

The Red Guards humbly accepted these opinions and, with this question in mind, studied Chairman Mao's works. They analyzed the situation of some students around them according to Chairman Mao's thought of uniting the majority to make the revolution. Except for a very few, most students were willing to make the revolution and were the objects of the Red Guards' unity. Of course, the organization of the Red Guards must be pure, with the "five red categories" as the main body, but it should not adopt a closed-door policy and ignore the masses. They also studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line, realizing that believing in the masses or not is a question of mass perspective and also a worldview question. The masses are the real heroes. Without the active participation of the masses, nothing can be done. To believe in the masses and blend in with them, one must humbly learn from the masses.

With enhanced mass awareness, they paid attention to deepening their contact with the masses, assigning some work to everyone, and pushing this revolutionary movement to a new high.

    小将“练兵”记
    ——北京女二中红卫兵总结前一阶段革命斗争经验
    北京市第二女子中学的红卫兵小将们，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，最听毛主席的话。她们在横扫一切牛鬼蛇神、破“四旧”立“四新”的同时，也注意改造自己的主观世界。她们结合斗争的需要，及时地学习了毛主席写的《整顿党的作风》《反对自由主义》和《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》，检查总结了前一段斗争的经验。这样，就使自己的队伍更加整齐，思想更加统一，步调更加一致，使自己的革命行动，更加符合毛泽东思想和党的政策。识透敌人，才能斗垮敌人
      “政策和策略是党的生命”。红卫兵，捍卫的是毛泽东思想，捍卫的是党的方针政策。红卫兵的一言一行，都应该符合毛泽东思想，符合党的方针政策。
    无产阶级文化大革命要用文斗，不用武斗。开始，有的同学没有很透彻地理解这一政策的深远意义，对这一点想不大通。她们说：阶级斗争，哪能那么“文气”？到底是以党的政策为准，还是以个人感情代替党的政策呢？大家学习毛主席说的这一段话：“只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。政策和策略是党的生命，……万万不可粗心大意。”大家认为，党的方针政策，集中体现了无产阶级的阶级利益，党的政策有鲜明的阶级性，执行党的政策，正是维护党和无产阶级的利益，正是爱憎分明的阶级感情的集中表现。红卫兵必须以党的政策为准则，符合党的政策的事坚决干，违背党的政策的事坚决不干。只有这样，我们才能成为毛主席的红卫兵，才能永远朝气蓬勃，永远立于不败之地。
    还有人提出：“武斗，才能使敌人真正低头。”怎样回答这个问题？她们认真地学习了《人民日报》社论《用文斗，不用武斗》。学习时，注意对照前一阶段斗争的实践，分析敌人坏在那里，怎样才能把敌人真正斗倒、斗垮、斗臭等等问题。大家一致认为，敌人坏在他们灵魂的深处，因此，他们最害怕的是揭露他们肮脏的灵魂。武斗，只能触及皮肉，不能触其灵魂。只有文斗，把敌人的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下，才能斗倒敌人，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子。
    道理懂了，思想通了，红卫兵一致表示：一定要不折不扣地贯彻执行党的政策，使革命运动沿着毛主席指引的方向前进。要同群众一起闹革命
    女二中的红卫兵小将们，造资产阶级的反，在社会上横扫“四旧”，开始没有注意组织其他革命同学参加。在一个时期内，红卫兵闹革命紧张万分，有的同学昼夜不眠。可是，另外一些同学却插不上手。
    在学习过程中，有些同学肯定了红卫兵的革命干劲，但也提出了一些批评。她们说：闹革命，你们走在头里，我们也有一颗革命的心！让我们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中共同前进吧。
    红卫兵虚心接受了这些意见，带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。她们按照毛主席团结大多数人一起闹革命的思想，分析了周围的一些同学的情况，除了极个别人以外，大多数同学都是愿意革命的，都是红卫兵团结的对象。当然，红卫兵的组织必须纯洁，要以“红五类”为主体，但是不能采取关门主义的态度，不能把群众扔在一边不闻不问。她们又学习了毛主席关于群众路线的教导，认识到，相信不相信群众，是个群众观点的问题，也是一个世界观问题。群众是真正的英雄，没有群众的积极参加，那是什么事情也干不好的。而要相信群众，和群众打成一片，就要虚心向群众学习。
    群众观念增强了，她们就注意深入联系群众，把一些工作交给大家去做，把这场革命运动推向一个更新的高潮。　本报记者
