The combat unity of the Chinese and Japanese people is unbreakable. The Zenkoku Gekijo (Progressive Theater) of Japan has overcome obstacles to visit China again and performed for the first time in Beijing.

At the opening ceremony before the performance, Chu Tu-nan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Kawarazaki Choichiro, leader of the Zenkoku Gekijo, both emphasized that any attempt to sow discord and sabotage will surely fail.

Xinhua News Agency, September 13th - The Zenkoku Gekijo of Japan performed for the first time in China this evening at the Capital Theater. This performance marks the victory of friendship and cultural exchange between the two countries, demonstrating that the combat friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people is unbreakable by any force.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Honorary President of the China-Japan Friendship Association Guo Moruo, President of the China-Japan Friendship Association Liao Chengzhi, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries Zhou Yiping, and over 1,400 people from various circles in the capital watched the performance. An opening ceremony was held before the performance. Chu Tu-nan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Kawarazaki Choichiro, leader of the Zenkoku Gekijo, spoke at the ceremony, both wishing for the continuous strengthening of the combat friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Chu Tu-nan said in his speech, "This time, the Zenkoku Gekijo, despite the obstruction and sabotage by various forces that are hostile to China and to the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, has once again visited China under the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship. This firm attitude of the Zenkoku Gekijo in cherishing the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people marks the victory of friendship and cultural exchange between the two countries."

Chu Tu-nan said, "Our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao has taught us: 'Except for the monopolistic capital and militaristic clique that are pro-American, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends.' We follow Chairman Mao's teachings to establish deep friendship with the broad masses of the Japanese people and oppose our common enemy, American imperialism, and its followers. The Chinese people are full of confidence in developing and consolidating the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people. The deep friendship and combat unity between the Chinese and Japanese people are unbreakable by any force. Whether it is American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, or the Soviet modern revisionist leadership and their various new and old followers, they attempt to sow discord, damage, and sabotage the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, they will surely be resisted and opposed by the Chinese and Japanese people and are doomed to fail."

He said, "Now, our revolutionary people are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, initiating an unprecedented high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution, with hundreds of millions of people joining the revolutionary torrent, with the heroic Red Guards as the vanguard, and with a revolutionary scene of hot enthusiasm throughout the country. This is a great innovation in the communist movement, a great innovation in the socialist revolution! In this great revolution, we must thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, that is, establish Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We must strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, and use Mao Zedong Thought to change the entire social landscape of our country."

Chu Tu-nan expressed his belief that the Japanese friends' visit to China this time will further strengthen the cultural exchange between the Chinese and Japanese people and further strengthen the unity and friendship between the two countries in their fight against their common enemy, American imperialism.

Kawarazaki Choichiro said in his speech, "We extend our warm and united greetings to the heroic Chinese people who, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China, are upholding proletarian dictatorship and building socialism."

Kawarazaki Choichiro said, "The realization of this visit and performance is a result of the friendship and cooperation between 100 million Japanese people and 700 million Chinese people overcoming various difficulties. This proves that no force can suppress and obstruct the friendship and unity between the Japanese and Chinese people. We have seen and heard in China, under the guidance of the spirit of self-reliance, the leapfrog development in various aspects of socialist construction and the success of the people's communes, which have greatly inspired us. Especially, we have had a rare opportunity to witness the high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution in Beijing and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the heroic Chinese people with the Red Guards as the vanguard."

The leader said, "The broad masses of the Japanese people are bravely fighting against the aggression of American imperialism and the sellout policies of Japanese monopolistic capital. The Zenkoku Gekijo, together with the Japanese people, is fighting to defend and develop Japanese culture, to resist the decadent culture of colonialism and the reactionary culture of reviving militarism, and to create democratic, national, and revolutionary theater that meets the needs of the vast majority of the people."

He expressed that the entire delegation of the Zenkoku Gekijo's visit to China will make their contribution to further strengthening the friendship and unity between the two countries, promoting cultural exchange between the two countries, and fighting for the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China. He concluded with a shout, "Long live the great Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the heroic Chinese people!"

Tonight, the Japanese artists performed the one-act comedy "Beard" reflecting the life of ancient Japanese peasants, and the drama "Honmachi-tei" reflecting the tragic life of Japanese folk artists and resisting American cultural invasion. The last scene of the drama is the folk artists, after visiting China, talking to the welcoming crowd about their longing for socialism. As the music "The East Is Red" played on stage, the entire audience burst into thunderous applause.

The Zenkoku Gekijo of Japan had visited China in 1960. They were warmly welcomed by the audience again tonight. After the performance, Guo Moruo, Liao Chengzhi, and others went on stage to shake hands with the actors and express their congratulations. Japanese peace activist Nishizono Koichi, who was in Beijing, also watched the performance.

    楚图南会长在讲话中说，这次前进座剧团不顾那些敌视中国和敌视中日人民友好的各种势力的阻挠和破坏，高举中日友好的旗帜，再一次访问中国，前进座剧团这种珍视中日两国人民友谊的坚定的表现，标志着中日两国人民友好和文化交流的胜利。
    楚图南说，我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席教导我们：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”我们正是遵循毛主席的教导，同广大日本人民建立深厚的友谊，反对中日两国人民的共同敌人美帝国主义及其追随者。中国人民对于发展和巩固中日两国人民的友好关系充满信心，中日两国人民之间的深厚友谊和战斗团结，是任何势力也破坏不了的。不论是美帝国主义和日本反动派也好，苏联现代修正主义领导集团及其形形色色新旧追随者也好，他们想要挑拨、损害、破坏中日两国人民的友好关系，都必将遭到中日两国人民的抵制和反对，他们是注定要失败的。
    他说，现在我们的革命人民，正在热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，兴起一个史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命高潮，亿万人民投入了革命的洪流，英雄的红卫兵充当了冲锋陷阵的急先锋，全国到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象。这是共产主义运动中的伟大创举，是社会主义革命的伟大创举！在这场大革命中，我们一定要大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，也就是大立毛泽东思想，毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。我们要努力学习毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，积极宣传毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，用毛泽东思想来改变我国的整个社会面貌。
    楚图南表示相信，日本朋友这次访问中国，必将进一步加强中日两国人民的文化交流，进一步加强中日两国人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义斗争中的团结和友谊。
    河原崎长十郎在讲话中说，我们向在毛泽东主席和中国共产党领导下、坚持无产阶级专政、进行社会主义建设的英雄的中国人民，致以热烈的团结的问候。
    河原崎长十郎团长说，这次访问演出的实现是一亿日本人民和七亿中国人民克服种种困难而取得的友好和合作的成果。这一事实证明：任何势力的压迫和阻挠都破坏不了日中两国人民的友好和团结。他在讲话中说，我们来到中国看到了和听到了中国在自力更生的革命精神的指引下，取得了社会主义建设各方面的飞跃发展，和人民公社的成功，这使我们受到了巨大的鼓舞。特别是，我们得到了一次难得的机会，能够亲眼看到北京无产阶级文化大革命的高潮，和以红卫兵为先锋的，英雄的中国人民的革命热情。
    团长说，广大的日本人民正在为反对美帝国主义的侵略和日本垄断资本的卖国政策而进行着英勇的斗争。前进座同日本人民一道，为保卫和发展日本的文化，为反对殖民地化的颓废文化和复活军国主义的反动文化而进行斗争，并为创造符合绝大多数人民群众所需要的民主的、民族的、革命的戏剧而从事活动。
    他表示，前进座访华演出团全体人员将为进一步加强两国人民的友好和团结、促进两国文化交流及推动恢复日中两国邦交的斗争，做出自己的贡献。他在最后高呼：“伟大的毛主席、中国共产党和英雄的中国人民万岁！”
    今晚，日本艺术家们表演了反映日本古代农民生活的独幕喜剧《鬍套》，和以反映日本民间艺人悲惨生活、抵制美国文化侵略为题材的话剧《本牧亭》。这个剧的最后一个情节，是访问中国后回到日本的民间艺人，向欢迎的人们畅谈他们向往社会主义的心情。随着台上响起了《东方红》的乐曲声，全场顿时掌声雷动。
    日本前进座剧团曾在一九六○年访问过中国。他们在今晚的演出，又一次受到了观众的热烈欢迎。今晚的演出结束后，郭沫若、廖承志等走上舞台，同演员们亲切握手，表示祝贺。在京的日本和平人士西园寺公一也观看了演出。
