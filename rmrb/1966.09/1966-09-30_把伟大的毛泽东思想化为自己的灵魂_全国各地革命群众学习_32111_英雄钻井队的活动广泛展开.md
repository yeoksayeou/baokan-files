The activity of learning from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team continues to spread widely across the country. In Nanjing, Hefei, Jinan, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Harbin, Changchun, Lanzhou, Xining, Hohhot, and Lhasa, and other places, the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres are studying the glorious deeds of the heroic drilling team with great excitement, one time after another, and propagating the glorious deeds of the heroic drilling team.

The broad revolutionary masses pointed out that the heroic deeds of the warriors of the 32111 Drilling Team originate from their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and from the great Mao Zedong Thought. Learning from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team is, in essence, to learn from them in "imprinting Chairman Mao's instructions in one's mind, dissolving them in one's blood, and implementing them in one's actions"; to learn from them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, truly transforming Mao Zedong Thought into one's soul.

Workers from many enterprises such as the Nanjing Automobile Parts Company, the East China Electronic Tube Factory, and the Fenghuangshan Iron Mine pointed out that once the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will generate boundless power, daring to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. Revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards from Nanjing University, Nanjing Medical College, and Nanjing Institute of Chemical Technology excitedly said that when Mao Zedong Thought becomes the soul of a collective, they become the collective Huang Jiguang, the collective Qiu Shaoyun, the collective Ouyang Hai, and the collective Mai Xiande.

More than twenty units, including the Hefei Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, Anhui Silk Factory, and Hefei Vehicle Factory, sent telegrams to the 32111 Drilling Team. The workers expressed their determination to learn from the heroes, to seize the revolution, promote production, and better complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the state.

In one night, revolutionary workers from the Jinan Diesel Engine Factory wrote more than 800 letters to the heroic drilling team. Firefighters from the Jinan Fire Brigade, at a meeting, used the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team as a mirror to consciously find gaps in their thoughts.

The heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team greatly inspired the broad revolutionary workers, Red Guards, and commune members in the suburbs of Zhengzhou. The more than 900 workers at the Henan First New China Printing Plant, who are printing Chairman Mao's works, all expressed their determination to print Chairman Mao's works faster and better, so that more workers, peasants, and soldiers can read Chairman Mao's books sooner. The broad Red Guards held discussions and decided to learn from the warriors' daring spirit of climbing mountains of knives and leaping into seas of fire.

In recent days, many factories, shops, schools, organizations, troops, and suburban communes in Changsha have organized discussions to learn from the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team. Workers from the "Five Good" team of the Hunan Power Machinery Factory, a model team in the industrial and transportation system of Hunan Province, said in a discussion that the heroic collective of the 32111 Drilling Team is a shining example for us to learn from. They have completely eliminated the "I" from their hearts. This shows that they have truly mastered Mao Zedong Thought and that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force.

In learning from the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team, the broad workers of all ethnic groups in Hohhot decided to take the heroic drilling team as an example, regarding reading Chairman Mao's books as the first need in life, and transforming Mao Zedong Thought into their souls.

The glorious deeds of the heroic 32111 Drilling Team reached Harbin, deeply inspiring the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary teachers and students. On the 28th, more than 1,000 workers from six units, including the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory, Electric Machine Factory, and Boiler Factory, jointly held a meeting to learn from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team. In the past two days, the Red Guards of Harbin have been driving propaganda cars on busy streets, propagating the glorious deeds of the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team.

Feng Qirong, a "Five Good" worker from the Changchun Locomotive Works, said: The comrades of the 32111 Drilling Team have used their blood and lives to protect state property, demonstrating the heroic spirit of our working class. We resolutely take the heroes as our example, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

After learning from the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team, many people in the Xining region were moved to tears. They all expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to learn the heroes' thoughts, to walk the heroes' path, to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and to strive for new victories in revolution and construction.

The heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team, fighting in the fire to rescue the gas well, crossed thousands of mountains and rivers to reach the Tibetan Plateau, stirring the hearts of millions of Tibetan and Han people. Tibetan and Han workers and Red Guard revolutionary youngsters in Lhasa, with tears in their eyes, finished reading the deeds of the heroic drilling team. They unanimously said that they would definitely follow the heroes in imprinting Chairman Mao's instructions in their minds, dissolving them in their blood, and implementing them in their actions, to launch a new high tide of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and to strive for double victories in revolution and production.
