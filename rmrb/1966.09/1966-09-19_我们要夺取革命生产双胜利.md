The entire workforce of the "Liu Hulan" brigade at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory has unanimously expressed their determination to be the main force of the Cultural Revolution and the vanguard of production construction, and to live up to the expectations of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive guiding us to advance bravely on both the spiritual and material fronts. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, we will be invincible. Since the Cultural Revolution began, we have insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the midst of struggle, learning and applying them simultaneously, and correctly handling the relationship between revolution and production. Even when some of our members were sent out to support other tasks, we rationally divided the work and made flexible arrangements, advocating the slogan of "one person doing the work of two." Our production level has improved month by month, with each month better than the last. In the past five months, while the Cultural Revolution has continuously achieved new victories, our brigade has comprehensively and evenly overfulfilled the production plan, with a product qualification rate of 100%.

Soon after the Cultural Revolution began, the revolutionary masses wrote a large number of big-character posters, and some capitalist roaders in power and ghosts and monsters were exposed. At this time, we emphasized that we must carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end and, at the same time, must direct the revolutionary enthusiasm aroused by the Cultural Revolution into production, creating outstanding achievements. The entire brigade's awareness has been raised, and we are united, firmly guarding our posts. During work hours, we concentrate on production, and after work, we strive to study Chairman Mao's works, arming ourselves to fiercely attack the capitalist roaders in power within the Party and all ghosts and monsters! Being a vanguard of the Cultural Revolution and a spearhead of production struggle has become the action slogan of the entire brigade.

In July, the production tasks were heavy. Because everyone recognized the correct relationship between revolution and production, and directed the sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm aroused by the Cultural Revolution fully into production, working hard, practically, and skillfully, the result was the complete and victorious fulfillment of the production tasks three days ahead of schedule.

The decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has illuminated the hearts of all members of our brigade. We have all seriously studied, become familiar with, mastered, and applied the "Sixteen Points," determined to carry them out without any deviation. We have written the decision on "grasping the revolution and promoting production" from the "Sixteen Points" into big-character posters, pasted them by the machines, studied them daily, and checked ourselves against them daily. The driving force on production has become stronger and stronger, and the production situation has become better and better. In August, all the work our brigade did was work we had never done before. For example, with the car body, initially only forty pieces could be produced per shift, and it seemed that the task might not be completed. What should we do? Everyone said to consult Chairman Mao's works and study the "Sixteen Points." After studying and discussing, everyone said: We must not only be bold in the Cultural Revolution but also bold in production. We must dare to pioneer, dare to work, and dare to make a revolution. We must "make up our minds, not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Thus, everyone racked their brains and thought of ways, improved the operating methods, and as a result, each shift produced 110 pieces, with efficiency increased by more than onefold. The August production task was completed two days ahead of schedule.

Currently, we are in the high tide of the Cultural Revolution and a crucial moment for completing the tasks of the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan. All members of our brigade have unanimously expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and use the "Sixteen Points" as a guide to resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, resolutely guard our posts, and excellently complete the production tasks, continuing to achieve double victories and double harvests in revolution and production.

    我们要夺取革命生产双胜利
    太原矿山机器厂　“刘胡兰”小组全体工人
    我们小组的全体工人，学习了《人民日报》《抓革命，促生产》的社论以后，一致表示，要做文化大革命的主力军、生产建设的突击队，决不辜负毛主席和党中央的殷切期望。
    伟大的毛泽东思想是引导我们在精神和物质两条战线上奋勇前进的火车头。只要听毛主席的话，就会无往而不胜。开展文化大革命以来，我们坚持在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，边学边用，正确地处理了革命和生产之间的关系。在抽人外出支援的情况下，合理分工，灵活安排，提出一个人顶两个人干的口号，生产水平月月提高，一个月比一个月好。最近五个月，在无产阶级文化大革命不断取得新胜利的同时，我们小组全面均衡地超额完成了生产计划，产品质量合格率达到百分之百。
    在文化大革命开始不久，广大革命群众写了大量的大字报，一些走资本主义道路的当权派和牛鬼蛇神被揪了出来。就在这时，我们强调地提出，一定要把文化大革命进行到底，同时必须把文化大革命中激发起来的革命干劲用到生产上来，在生产上创造出色的成绩。全组工人思想认识提高了，团结一致，坚守岗位，上班集中力量搞生产，下班就努力学习毛主席著作，掌握武器狠狠地向钻进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派及一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火！当文化大革命的闯将，做生产斗争的尖兵，已经成为全组的行动口号。
    七月份生产任务很大，由于大家认清了革命与生产两者之间的正确关系，把文化大革命激发起来的冲天革命干劲，充分运用到生产上来，苦干、实干、巧干，结果提前三天全面胜利地完成生产任务。
    中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定，照亮了全组同志的心。我们全组同志都认真学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条，决心不折不扣地按十六条办事。我们把十六条里关于抓革命促生产的决定，写成大字报，贴在机器旁，天天学习，天天对照，对生产的推动作用越来越强大，生产形势也越来越好。八月份，我们小组干的活，都是从来没干过的。如车外壳，开始一班只能生产四十件，眼看任务有完不成的危险。怎么办呢？大家说请示毛主席著作，学习十六条。经过学习和讨论，大家说：我们不仅要在文化大革命中“敢”字当头，在生产上也要“敢”字当头，要敢闯、敢干、敢革命，要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”于是，个个动脑筋，人人想办法，改进了操作法，结果每班生产达到一百一十件，效率提高一倍多。八月份生产任务又提前两天完成。
    目前，正处在文化大革命的高潮中，也是完成第三个五年计划第一年任务的关键时刻，全组同志们一致表示，要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，以十六条为指针，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，坚决坚守岗位，出色完成生产任务，继续夺取革命和生产双胜利、双丰收。
