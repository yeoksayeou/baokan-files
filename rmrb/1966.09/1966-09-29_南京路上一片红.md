Nanjing Road, the most bustling commercial district in Shanghai, has a history of over a hundred years. Before liberation, it was the "paradise" of the exploiting classes and thus the place where filth and dirt were most concentrated. Now, the stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are sweeping away all the remaining filth of imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism. Nanjing Road has undergone earth-shaking changes.

We report here some fragments of the changes on Nanjing Road.

	Shattering the "Old Yong'an Spirit"

	In the Yong'an Company (now renamed Hongwei Department Store), there was an eight-tone chime. Before liberation, it was used to signal meal times, and after liberation, it was changed to signal the start and end of the workday. Every time the chime sounded, many old employees would recall the bitter years before liberation, remembering the capitalist's cruel exploitation, and their hearts would fill with boundless hatred! They no longer wanted to hear such sounds and suggested replacing it. At this time, some retained capitalist elements with ulterior motives spoke up. They said: Yong'an Company is famous both domestically and internationally, and this chime symbolizes the "Old Yong'an Spirit," which cannot be abolished. The so-called "Old Yong'an Spirit" is the capitalist's delusion of continuing to ride on the heads of the working people and carry out cruel exploitation. Here, the ghosts of the capitalist class are not dispersed, and the "Old Yong'an Spirit" is still shackling many people.

	In this struggle, the workers sharpened their eyes, recognized the reactionary nature of the capitalist class, and ignited boundless class hatred, determined to thoroughly smash all the spiritual shackles of the capitalist class that bind them, and to thoroughly destroy the "Four Olds." They smashed the old sign of "Yong'an" and replaced it with the new store name "Hongwei." The chime that supposedly symbolized the "Old Yong'an Spirit" was also discarded, replaced by the resounding sound of an electric bell.

	Now, when the newly installed electric bell rings, the old employees excitedly say: "In the past, when we heard the chime, our hearts felt heavy, and we couldn't hold our heads high; now, when we hear the bell, it is invigorating, and we truly feel like masters!"

	The Standpoint Has Begun to Change

	On Nanjing Road, there are some shops that primarily cater to the capitalist class, and their capitalist management ideas and habits are deeply rooted.

	The Nanjing Hairdressing Company (now renamed Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Hairdressing Shop) is a four-story building that originally had strange and grotesque hairstyle posters of so-called "beauties" and high-end cosmetics. The services included items like facials and facial massages. Capitalist elements came and went, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers said: "That place is where the capitalist class emits foul odors."

	Recently, a large red notice appeared in front of this hairdressing shop, praising the revolutionary employees of the shop for organizing small teams to go deep into factories, alleys, and rural areas to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. What is this about?

	Originally, the revolutionary employees of this shop, under the guidance of the Red Guards' revolutionary actions, studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other articles, followed Chairman Mao's instructions to definitely shift the standpoint to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, organized small teams to go deep into factories, alleys, and rural areas, and provided hairdressing services for workers, peasants, and soldiers while participating in labor and reforming their own thoughts.

	Among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the employees received profound class education. A 58-year-old old worker and manager, Liu Ruicheng, led ten hairdressers to the suburbs to serve the peasants. He washed the hair of an 82-year-old poor peasant woman, and this poor peasant was very moved and praised him in front of everyone. Liu Ruicheng was also very moved and said: "I have been cutting hair for capitalist elements for decades and have never heard words of gratitude; if I am not careful, I might even be scolded; today, I washed the hair of a class sister just once, and she praised me. Today, I truly understand that in the past, I did not want to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is the most shameful thought."

	After returning to the shop, he immediately led all the employees to remove all the capitalist-style decorations from the shop, hang up portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao; adjusted the service items and prices, and was determined to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	The Debate Over "Speed"

	On August 19, Shanghai held a million-people parade. Seeing the revolutionary masses, one by one, with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm passing by the door, the employees of the New Ya Cantonese Restaurant (now named Hongqi Restaurant) thought: How can we contribute to the Cultural Revolution? The prices of the dishes in this restaurant have always been very high. On this day, they made an exception by providing a dish priced at only 1.5 fen, allowing many participants in the parade to eat on time.

	Since then, revolutionary employees have proactively adjusted the service items and lowered the prices of the dishes, appearing with a bowl of soup priced at 1.2 fen and a plate of stir-fried greens priced at 0.8 fen. As a result, the number of customers surged, and the business volume continued to rise. The old rules and old practices became very inappropriate, and a series of problems emerged. These problems were concentrated on the word "speed." In the past, the capitalist class came for big eating and drinking, they did not cherish time, nor did they need "speed," and the service staff also developed the habit of being slow. The broad masses of customers had many complaints about this.

	The party branch comrades believed: In this word "speed," there is a struggle between two thoughts and two styles. To educate the employees, they launched a discussion among all the employees. Through the discussion, everyone unified their understanding: "Speed" is the need of the revolution, it is the requirement of the workers, peasants, and soldiers; but "speed" is not about lowering quality, on the contrary, it should be better than before. This is a matter of revolutionary enthusiasm and class feelings. To serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers quickly and well, we must break away from old frameworks, give full play to our subjective initiative, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers with full enthusiasm.

	After that, the employees racked their brains, found ways, and reformed the old rules and operating procedures. The famous chef Yin Guang, who used to not want to cook ordinary dishes, came up with many new ways to cook dishes this time to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers quickly and well.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened a new chapter for Nanjing Road, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition. Along the more than ten-mile-long Nanjing Road, one can see countless red flags, red slogans, and red propaganda posters. Everywhere, there are portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and golden Mao quotations, a dazzling red color that inspires revolutionary passion. The working people walking on Nanjing Road have never been as proud and confident as they are today.

	Some revolutionary veterans who once fought on Nanjing Road, when they saw the great changes on Nanjing Road, were deeply moved. A comrade who participated in the strike on Nanjing Road in 1927 said: "Today, the broad masses of workers on Nanjing Road have not only stood up politically and economically, but also have completely stood up spiritually and ideologically."

	The great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is flying high on Nanjing Road. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of Shanghai are marching forward bravely!

### 南京路上一片红

专栏：

    南京路上一片红
    上海市最繁华的商业区南京路，已经有了一百年的历史。这里在解放前是剥削阶级的“乐园”，因而也是藏污纳垢最多的地方。现在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨，正在荡涤着帝国主义、封建主义和资本主义一切残存的污垢。南京路起了翻天覆地的变化。
    我们在这里报道南京路变化的一些片断。
    砸碎“老永安精神”
    在永安公司（现改名红卫百货店）里，有一只八音琴。解放前用它作开饭的讯号，解放后改作上下班的讯号。每当八音琴敲响，许多老职工就触景生情地回忆解放前辛酸的年月，想起了资本家残酷的剥削，激起了心头无限的痛恨！他们再也不愿听到这样的声音，建议把它换掉。这时，一些留用的别有用心的资产阶级分子出来说话了。他们说：永安公司中外驰名，这琴声象征着“老永安精神”，不能废掉。所谓“老永安精神”，就是资本家妄想继续骑在劳动人民头上实行残酷剥削的精神。在这里，资产阶级阴魂不散，“老永安精神”还在束缚着不少人。
    职工们在这次斗争中擦亮了眼睛，认清了资产阶级的反动本质，激起了无比的阶级仇恨，决心彻底砸碎资产阶级束缚自己的一切精神枷锁，大破“四旧”。他们砸掉了“永安”的老牌子，换上了“红卫”的新店名。那只所谓象征“老永安精神”的八音琴，也被废弃了，代之以响亮的电铃声。
    现在，当新装的电铃响起，老职工们便兴奋地说：“过去听到琴声心里发闷，抬不起头；现在听到铃声振奋人心，感到真正当了主人！”
    立足点开始转过来了
    在南京路，有一些店铺以资产阶级为主要消费对象，它们的资产阶级经营思想和经营作风积习很深。
    南京理发公司（现改名工农兵理发店）这家四开面的铺子里，原来挂满了奇形怪状发型的所谓“美人”头像，摆满了高级化妆品，……服务项目有所谓美容、脸部按摩等名目。资产阶级分子在这里进进出出，广大工农兵群众说：“那里是资产阶级放臭气的地方。”
    就在这一家理发店门前，最近出现了一张大红喜报，表扬这个理发店的革命职工，派出小分队，深入工厂、农村为工农兵服务的行动。这是怎么一回事呢？
    原来，这个店的革命职工，在红卫兵革命行动启示下，学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等文章，遵照毛主席关于一定要把立足点移到工农兵方面来的教导，组织小分队深入工厂、里弄、农村，为工农兵理发，在那里一边参加劳动，一边改造自己的思想。
    在工农兵中间，职工们受到了深刻的阶级教育。五十八岁的老工人、经理刘瑞卿，带领十名理发工人，到郊区为农民服务。他替一位八十二岁的贫农老太太洗头，这位老贫农感动得很，在大伙面前表扬了他。刘瑞卿也很受感动，他说：“我为资产阶级分子理了几十年发，没有听到感激的话，一不小心，还要挨骂；今天我为阶级姐妹洗一次头，就表扬了我。今天我才真正体会到，过去不愿为工农兵服务，这是最可耻的思想。”
    回店以后，他立即带领全体职工，去掉店内一切带有资本主义色彩的装潢，挂上毛主席像和毛主席语录；调整了服务项目和价格，决心为工农兵服务。
    关于“快”的争论
    八月十九日，上海举行了百万人大游行。眼看着革命群众一个个怀着无比高昂的革命热情从门口经过，新雅粤菜馆（现名红旗饭店）的职工们想：我们怎样为文化大革命贡献一份力量呢？这家饭店的菜价一直都很昂贵。这一天，他们破例向顾客供应了一种价格仅一角五分的盖交饭，使许多参加游行的群众，及时地吃上了饭。
    从那以后，革命职工又主动地调整了服务项目，降低了菜的价格，出现了一角二分一碗的汤，和八分钱一盘的炒青菜。这样一来，顾客骤增，营业额不断上升，过去的旧规章旧作风显得很不相适应，产生了一系列的问题。这些问题集中反映在一个“快”字上。过去资产阶级是为大吃大喝而来的，他们不珍惜时间，也不需要“快”，服务员也养成了慢条斯理的习惯。广大顾客们对这很有意见。
    党支部同志认为：在这个“快”字里，有两种思想和两种作风的斗争。为了教育职工，便在全体职工中发动了一次讨论。通过讨论，大家统一了认识：“快”是革命的需要，是工农兵对我们提出的要求；但是“快”不是降低质量，相反，还应当比过去服务得更好。这是个政治热情问题，也是阶级感情问题。为了又快又好地为工农兵服务，就要破除旧框框，发挥最大的主观能动性，满腔热情地为工农兵服务。
    此后，职工们动脑筋，想办法，改革了旧的规章制度和操作规程。名厨师殷光过去不愿炒一般的菜，这次，为了又快又好地为工农兵服务，想了许多炒菜的新办法。
    无产阶级文化大革命，为具有光荣革命传统的南京路开创了崭新的一页。在长达十多里的南京路上，只见无数红色的旗帜，红色的标语，红色的宣传画，到处是我们伟大领袖毛主席的像和金光闪闪的毛主席语录牌，一片振奋人们革命激情的光耀夺目的鲜红颜色。劳动人民走在南京路上，从来没有像今天这样昂首阔步。
    一些曾经战斗在南京路上的革命老前辈，当他们看到南京路的巨大变化，抚今比昔，万分激动！一九二七年参加过南京路上罢工斗争的一位老同志说：“今天，南京路上广大职工不仅从政治上经济上翻了身，而且从精神上思想上彻底翻了身。”
    毛泽东思想的伟大红旗高高地飘扬在南京路上，上海革命人民在毛泽东思想的指引下，奋勇前进！
