In the triumphant atmosphere of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shandong Province's Yantai Fertilizer Plant and Linqu Fertilizer Plant have recently been completed and put into production one after the other. With this, Shandong Province now has nine fertilizer plants and one workshop producing nitrogen fertilizers.

The Yantai Fertilizer Plant, with an annual production capacity of 20,000 tons of ammonium bicarbonate, has been under construction since March this year. The workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have worked tirelessly for over five months, completing the construction task one month ahead of schedule. This plant will play a crucial role in supporting agricultural production in the Yantai region after its completion.

The Linqu Fertilizer Plant is the first small-scale ammonia synthesis plant in Shandong Province designed, equipped, and constructed by the province's workers themselves. The workers building this plant have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics, and are determined to contribute to the promotion and development of agricultural production. They completed the construction of the plant in just six months.

    山东建成两座化肥厂
    据新华社济南十七日电　在无产阶级文化大革命的胜利声中，山东省烟台化肥厂和临朐化肥厂在最近先后建成并投入生产。至此，山东省已有九个生产氮肥的化肥厂和一个车间。
    年产两万吨碳酸氢氨氮肥的烟台化肥厂，自今年三月份开始安装设备以来，职工们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，艰苦奋斗五个多月，提前一个月完成了建设任务。这个工厂建成后，对支援烟台地区的农业生产将起重要作用。
    临朐化肥厂是山东省广大职工自己设计、自己制造设备、自己施工的第一座小型合成氨厂。建设这个厂的职工们活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出政治，决心为促进和发展农业生产贡献自己的力量，仅仅用了六个月的时间，就把工厂建成了。
