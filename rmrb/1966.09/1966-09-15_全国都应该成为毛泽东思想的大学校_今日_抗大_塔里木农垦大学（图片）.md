The entire nation should become a school for studying Mao Zedong Thought. Today's "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" – Tarim Agricultural Reclamation University.

Tarim Agricultural Reclamation University holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely implements Mao Zedong's proletarian educational line. They always use Chairman Mao's works as the main course, arming revolutionary teachers and students with Mao Zedong Thought. This is a teacher from the agricultural university lecturing to students on Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

The agricultural university moves the classroom to the vast fields, closely combining book knowledge with productive practice. This greatly improves teaching quality and cultivates new people who love labor. This is a student from the Water Conservancy Class 65 practicing in the field.

Students of the agricultural university return from labor.

At all times, they do not forget to study Chairman Mao's works. This is a worker from the Sericulture Station studying Chairman Mao's works during a break from labor in the field.

The agricultural university has always maintained the fine traditions of the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University." They have achieved action militarization, life collectivization, and organization militarization. Students study politics and various production skills while also training hard to defend the motherland. This is them participating in a uniform competition.

Youth from Shanghai, some of whom had never even seen a cotton field before, have, after labor training at the agricultural university, now become capable of managing high-standard cotton fields. This is three youths from Shanghai managing a cotton field.

In its first year of establishment, the agricultural university harvested over 500,000 jin of grain, achieving complete self-sufficiency in grain. The photographs in this section are from Xinhua News Agency.

    全国都应该成为毛泽东思想的大学校
    今日“抗大”——塔里木农垦大学
    塔里木农垦大学高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决按照毛主席制定的无产阶级教育路线办学。他们始终以毛主席著作为主课，用毛泽东思想武装革命师生的头脑。这是农大的教师向同学们讲述毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。
    农垦大学把课堂搬向广阔的田野，使书本知识同生产实践紧密结合。这样做，大大提高了教学质量，培育了热爱劳动的新人。这是水利六五班学生在野外实习。
    农垦大学的学生劳动归来。
    时刻不忘学习毛主席著作。这是蚕桑站的工人利用劳动休息时间，在地头学习毛主席著作。
    农垦大学一直保持着“抗大”的优良校风。他们做到了行动战斗化、生活集体化、组织军事化。学生一边学习政治和各种生产技能，一边苦练保卫祖国的过硬本领。这是他们进行着装竞赛。
    来自上海的青年，有的人过去连棉田都没有到过。在农垦大学经过劳动锻炼，现在已能管理高标准的棉田。这是来自上海的三个青年在管理棉田。
    农垦大学建校第一年，就收获了五十多万斤粮食，做到粮食全部自给。　本版照片是新华社稿
