In recent years, the broad masses of workers in China's textile printing and dyeing industry have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, practiced self-reliance, and striven for self-improvement. With a spirit of daring to innovate, they have broken through foreign constraints, launched mass movements, and focused on key production issues to carry out technological revolutions. They have achieved many remarkable new devices.

These new achievements by textile workers have once again given a resounding slap in the face to those bourgeois "experts" and "authorities." They have once again powerfully proven that to rapidly develop China's textile science and technology, we must thoroughly break away from the superstition of foreign equipment and completely eliminate the "Jia Gui" mentality. The more thoroughly we break away from the superstition of foreign equipment, the more Chinese-style, world-class innovations we will have; the more thoroughly we eliminate the "Jia Gui" mentality, the more brilliant the achievements will be in catching up with and surpassing world standards. Here are some very convincing examples.

Automatic Screen Printing Machine

Silk printing has traditionally been done by hand, with workers facing a high labor intensity.

In 1963, the workers of the Wuxi Silk Printing and Dyeing Factory set ambitious goals, determined to forge their own path, practice self-reliance, and start from scratch. They boldly attempted to manufacture printing machines. By the first half of 1964, they had developed a prototype of an automatic printing machine.

In September 1964, a Chinese-style automatic screen printing machine was finally successfully created. After being tested in actual production, its efficiency was increased by 1.2 times compared to manual operation, the product quality was also good, and the cost was only one-twelfth of that of foreign equipment. Moreover, it could utilize existing factory buildings and equipment and could be widely applied to the technological transformation of other old factories.

    近几年，我国印染工业的广大职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，自力更生，奋发图强，“敢”字当头，大破洋框框，大搞群众运动，针对生产关键大闹技术革命，搞出了不少很有水平的新设备。
    纺织工人的这些新成就，再一次给那些资产阶级“专家”、“权威”老爷们一记响亮的耳光。再一次有力地证明，高速度地发展我国纺织科学技术，必须彻底破除对洋设备的迷信，必须彻底打倒“贾桂思想”。对洋设备的迷信破得越彻底，中国式的、创世界水平的东西就会越多；“贾桂思想”破除得越彻底，赶超世界水平的成果就越辉煌。下面就是一些很有说服力的例证。

    丝绸印花，一向是手工操作，工人劳动强度很大。
    一九六三年，无锡丝绸印染厂工人，树雄心，立大志，走自己的道路，自力更生，白手起家，大胆试制印花机。到一九六四年上半年，搞出了自动印花机的雏形。
    一九六四年九月，一台中国式的自动筛网印花机终于创造成功了。经过生产实践的考验，效率比手工操作提高一点二倍，产品质量也好，造价仅等于洋设备的十二分之一，而且可以利用原有厂房和设备，可以普遍应用于其他老厂的技术改造。
