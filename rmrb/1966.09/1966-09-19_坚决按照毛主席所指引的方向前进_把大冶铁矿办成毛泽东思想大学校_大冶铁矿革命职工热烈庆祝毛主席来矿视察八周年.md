Resolutely Advance in the Direction Indicated by Chairman Mao
Make the Daye Iron Mine a School of Mao Zedong Thought
The Revolutionary Workers of the Daye Iron Mine Warmly Celebrate the Eighth Anniversary of Chairman Mao's Inspection of the Mine

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 18th – On September 15th, all the revolutionary workers of the Daye Iron Mine, one of China's famous modern mines, held a grand rally to warmly celebrate the eighth anniversary of the inspection of the Daye Iron Mine by our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao. The workers solemnly pledged to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao: to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end; to make the Daye Iron Mine a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

On September 15, 1958, our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao, inspected the Daye Iron Mine and met with all the revolutionary workers. Chairman Mao's warm instructions and great concern gave the revolutionary workers of the Daye Iron Mine immense encouragement and strength. Over the past eight years, the workers have followed the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and actively participated in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. They overcame one difficulty after another and finally built the Daye Iron Mine into a modern mine.

High Taihe, a worker from the mining department of the Daye Iron Mine, with boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, said excitedly: "Eight years ago on September 15th was the happiest and most unforgettable day of my life. On that day, I shook hands with and spoke to our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. I will definitely follow Chairman Mao forward in the face of great winds and waves. I will defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the death."

To raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and never forget Chairman Mao's instructions, all the revolutionary workers of the mine decided to make September 15th a permanent memorial day for the Daye Iron Mine. At the celebration rally, they unanimously passed a telegram of respect to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The telegram stated that all the revolutionary workers of the mine will unswervingly take Mao Zedong Thought as their guide and use the "Sixteen Points" as their weapon. They will seize the revolution and promote production, achieve double victories in revolution and production, and complete and overfulfill this year's national plan.
