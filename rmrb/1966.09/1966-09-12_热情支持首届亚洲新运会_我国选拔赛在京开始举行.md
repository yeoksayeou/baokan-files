The selection competition for the People's Republic of China's delegation to the first Asian New Forces Games began in Beijing today. When the chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the People's Republic of China's participation in the first Asian New Forces Games and deputy director of the State Sports Commission, Rong Gaotang, announced the opening of the selection competition, the audience responded with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause, expressing the Chinese people's enthusiastic support for the first Asian New Forces Games.

The eight competition venues for the selection competition were all newly decorated today. Each venue prominently displayed a large portrait of our great leader, teacher, and helmsman Chairman Mao, as well as Mao's quotations and large banners. Red flags fluttered in the wind around the competition grounds. Our outstanding athletes, who are participating in the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, gathered from all over the country in Beijing. They participated in this selection competition with great revolutionary fervor.

This selection competition will run from September 11th to 18th and includes twelve competitive events: football, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, badminton, track and field, swimming, shooting, archery, gymnastics, weightlifting, and cycling.

Today, the selection competitions for men's and women's basketball and weightlifting were held. In the evening, two exciting basketball matches were held at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium: the Shanghai women's team versus the Hebei women's team, and the Beijing Institute of Physical Education men's team versus the Shanghai men's team. These matches were warmly welcomed by more than 15,000 spectators.

Before the competition began, when the athletes carried the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and held the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as they entered the venue, the entire audience responded with enthusiastic applause. The athletes, referees, and spectators all studied the quotations from Chairman Mao before and during the breaks in the competition, expressing their boundless faith, reverence, and love for Mao Zedong Thought. The results of the matches were that the Shanghai women's team and the Beijing Institute of Physical Education men's team each emerged victorious.

The weightlifters all focused on studying Chairman Mao's works before the competition. The venue's loudspeakers continuously broadcasted quotations from Chairman Mao to encourage the athletes to achieve good results for the revolution.

Outstanding weightlifters from Xinjiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Shandong, and the People's Liberation Army entered the competition venue holding high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read a passage from the quotations. At this moment, the entire venue erupted in enthusiastic applause. Wu Guanjie from the People's Liberation Army team broke the 1965 national record for the total score in the middleweight category with a total score of 445 kilograms. Deng Guoyin from Sichuan Province broke the 1965 national record for the lightweight push press category with a score of 138 kilograms.
