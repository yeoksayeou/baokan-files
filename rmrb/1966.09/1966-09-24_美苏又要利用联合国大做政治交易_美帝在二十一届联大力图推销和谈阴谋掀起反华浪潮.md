The United Nations General Assembly's 21st session opened in New York on the 20th. There are more than ninety items on the agenda, and the session is expected to last about three months.

Various signs indicate that the issue of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam will take a prominent position in this session of the General Assembly. U.S. Representative to the United Nations Goldberg openly declared on the 18th that the United States will raise the "Vietnam War issue" at the General Assembly, particularly striving to peddle Johnson's "peace talks" deception. He also bluntly stated that in this regard, the United States is willing to "request Soviet mediation to resolve the Vietnam conflict through negotiations." Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, in a statement issued the same day in New York, winks at the U.S. government's "peace talks" deception, declaring that the Soviet authorities are willing to "cooperate with all those who care about 'peace'." It is reported that U.S. delegation head to this session of the General Assembly, Vice President Humphrey, and Gromyko both met with United Nations Secretary-General U Thant on the 20th to discuss the Vietnam issue. Gromyko will also meet with U.S. Secretary of State Rusk on the 22nd. U.S. newspapers generally believe that in the activities of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in this session of the General Assembly, discussing the Vietnam issue will be a major aspect. To use this session of the General Assembly to promote the "peace talks" conspiracy, the U.S. government has recently rallied its big and small lackeys, including U Thant, the president of the previous session of the General Assembly Fanfani, the Pope, and some puppet state leaders, to drum up support, attempting to push this dirty conspiracy to a new high.

The U.S. authorities have also indicated that they will vigorously stir up an anti-China wave at this session of the General Assembly. The American imperialists and their followers, who are terrified by the Chinese people's Cultural Revolution, have been screaming at the top of their lungs, desperately attacking and slandering China. Rusk reiterated at a recent press conference that the U.S. government is determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people and to obstruct the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. They also want to bring this reverse current to this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

According to various reports, the U.S. and the Soviet Union will also engage in political deals on several issues inside and outside this session of the United Nations General Assembly. These issues include the so-called "peaceful use" of celestial bodies, the "prevention of nuclear proliferation," the issue of a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing, and the establishment of a "United Nations army." The U.S. government has recently expressed more than once its hope that the U.S. and the Soviet Union can reach an agreement on a treaty regarding the "peaceful use" of celestial bodies at this session of the General Assembly and make "progress" in negotiations on issues such as "preventing nuclear proliferation."

The revolutionary peoples of the world have already clearly recognized from their own experiences that the United Nations, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, has done nothing but evil. People must not harbor any unrealistic illusions about it. The only way out for the United Nations is to thoroughly break the control of the United States and thoroughly reorganize the United Nations.

    美苏又要利用联合国大做政治交易
    美帝在二十一届联大力图推销和谈阴谋掀起反华浪潮
    据新华社二十一日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会第二十一届会议二十日在纽约开幕。列在大会议程上的项目有九十多个，预计会议大约要开三个月。
    种种迹象说明，在这一届联大会议上，美国侵越战争问题将占突出的地位。美国驻联合国代表戈德堡十八日明白宣告，美国将向大会提出“越南战争问题”，特别是将竭力兜售约翰逊的“和谈”骗局。他还露骨地说，在这方面，美国乐于“请苏联斡旋，以使越南冲突能够通过谈判得到解决”。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯同一天在纽约发表的声明中对美国当局的“和谈”骗局频送秋波，宣告苏联当局愿同所有关心“和平”的人“合作”。据报道，美国出席本届联大代表团团长、副总统汉弗莱和葛罗米柯已经在二十日分别会见了联合国秘书长吴丹，讨论越南问题。葛罗米柯还将在二十二日会见美国国务卿腊斯克。美国报刊普遍认为，在美苏两国在本届联大进行的勾勾搭搭的活动中，讨论越南问题将是一个主要方面。为了利用这一届联大推行“和谈”阴谋，美国政府这几天还纠合它大大小小的娄罗，包括吴丹、上届联大主席范范尼、罗马教皇和一些仆从国的头子擂鼓助阵，力图把这个肮脏阴谋推向一个新的高潮。
    美国当局还表明，在这一届联大会议上，它将竭力掀起反华浪潮。被中国人民的文化大革命运动吓得心惊胆颤的美帝国主义者及其追随者最近声嘶力竭地拚命对中国进行攻击和诬蔑。腊斯克在最近的一次记者招待会上重申美国政府决心同中国人民为敌，坚持阻挠恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位。他们还要把这股逆流带到这届联合国大会上。
    据各方消息透露，在本届联合国大会内外，美苏两国还将在一些问题上进行政治交易。这些问题包括所谓“和平利用”天体问题、“防止核扩散”问题、全面禁止核试验问题，以及建立“联合国军”问题等。美国政府最近已经不止一次地表示希望美苏两国在本届联大能够就缔结一项关于“和平利用”天体的条约达成协议，并且在谈判“防止核扩散”等问题上取得“进展”。
    世界各国的革命人民从自己的切身体验中已经清楚地认识到：联合国在美帝国主义的操纵下，做尽了坏事，人们对它绝不能抱有任何不切实际的幻想。联合国的出路只有一条，这就是彻底打破美国的控制，彻底改组联合国。
