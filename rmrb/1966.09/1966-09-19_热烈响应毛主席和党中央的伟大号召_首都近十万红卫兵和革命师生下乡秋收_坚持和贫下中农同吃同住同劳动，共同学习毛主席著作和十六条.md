Nearly 100,000 Red Guards and revolutionary students from the capital, in response to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, have rushed to the front lines of agricultural production in the suburbs to participate in labor, assist with the autumn harvest, and learn from the revolutionary spirit and diligent qualities of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

In recent days, on the roads leading to the suburbs' people's communes, columns of Red Guards and revolutionary students, carrying red flags and Chairman Mao's quotations, with their luggage on their backs, singing revolutionary songs, are marching towards the countryside. Before setting out, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations on the need for intellectual youth to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and related articles on ideological remolding. They also studied the speeches given by Comrade Lin Biao and Premier Zhou Enlai at the reception of revolutionary students from all over the country who came to Beijing. They are determined to temper themselves through autumn harvest labor.

In the Dongsheng People's Commune in the western suburbs, thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary students come to support the triple autumn harvest every day. They eat, live, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasant community members, and together study Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points." They are not afraid of hardship or fatigue in labor, volunteering for dirty and heavy work. This commune's triple autumn harvest tasks are heavier than in previous years, but with the help of the Red Guards and revolutionary students, the progress is faster than in previous years.

Nearly a thousand Red Guards and revolutionary students have come to the Haixiang Le region in the old revolutionary base of Changping County, north of Beijing, to participate in labor. Upon arriving at the production brigade, they were welcomed into the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. The community members first inquired about Chairman Mao's health, and the Red Guards enthusiastically shared the moving scene of Chairman Mao's recent reception of them at Tiananmen Square. The community members were overjoyed to hear that Chairman Mao was in good health. Many revolutionary students also visited old guerrilla fighters, old militia members, and military dependents, listened to them recount the history of class struggle in the village and their family histories, and visited the class education exhibition. The poor and lower-middle peasant community members urged them to always remember the bitterness of their class, never forgetting the blood debt. In the process of "three togetherness" (eating, living, and working together), the Red Guards and revolutionary students deeply felt that learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants first means learning their profound class feelings of love for the Party, Chairman Mao, and socialism.

The Red Guards and revolutionary students who went to the countryside to participate in the autumn harvest took Chairman Mao's works wherever they went. Many revolutionary students used their rest time during labor to study Chairman Mao's quotations and the "Sixteen Points" with the community members in the fields. In the evenings, they read Chairman Mao's works to the illiterate community members; they also wrote blackboard newspapers and Chairman Mao's quotations with the local youth community members, organized revolutionary cultural performances, and used every opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Many poor and lower-middle peasants praised these revolutionary youngsters, saying, "The Red Guards are truly Chairman Mao's good soldiers, the good descendants of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the red successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

    热烈响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召
    首都近十万红卫兵和革命师生下乡秋收
    坚持和贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，共同学习毛主席著作和十六条
    据新华社十八日讯  首都近十万名大中学校的红卫兵和革命师生，响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，奔赴郊区农业生产第一线，参加劳动，帮助秋收，学习广大贫农下中农革命干劲和勤劳的品质。
    这几天，在通往郊区各人民公社的大路上，一队队红卫兵和革命师生，高举红旗和毛主席语录板，背着行装，唱着革命歌曲向农村行进。他们在出发前反复学习了毛主席关于知识青年要与工农兵相结合的语录和有关思想改造的文章，学习了林彪同志和周恩来同志在接见全国各地来京革命师生大会上的讲话，下定决心要在秋收劳动中锻炼自己。
    在西郊的东升人民公社，每天有数千名红卫兵和革命师生来支援三秋。他们和贫农下中农社员同吃、同住、同劳动、共同学习毛主席著作和十六条。他们在劳动中不怕苦，不怕累，抢着干脏活、累活。这个公社三秋任务比往年繁重，但是在红卫兵和革命师生的大力帮助下，进度却比往年快。
    有近千名红卫兵和革命师生来到京北昌平县老革命根据地的海?乐地区参加劳动。他们一到生产队就被贫农下中农接到家里，社员们首先问候毛主席，红卫兵们接着就兴致勃勃地介绍了最近毛主席在天安门广场接见他们的动人情景，社员们听说毛主席的身体很健康，都感到无比喜悦。不少革命师生还访问了老武工队员、老民兵和军烈属，听他们讲村里的阶级斗争史，讲家史，还参观了阶级教育展览，贫农下中农社员嘱咐他们千万要牢记阶级苦，不忘血泪仇。红卫兵和革命师生在“三同”的过程中，深深体会到，向贫农下中农学习，首先是要学习他们对党、对毛主席、对社会主义无限热爱的深厚阶级感情。
    下乡参加秋收的红卫兵和革命师生，来到哪里就把毛主席著作带到哪里。许多革命师生利用劳动休息时间同社员一道在田头学习毛主席语录，学习十六条，晚上为不识字的社员念毛主席著作；他们还同当地的青少年社员一起写黑板报、写毛主席语录，组织革命文艺晚会，利用各种场合宣传毛泽东思想。许多贫下中农称赞这些革命小将说，红卫兵真不愧是毛主席的好战士，贫下中农的好后代，无产阶级革命事业的红色接班人。（附图片）
