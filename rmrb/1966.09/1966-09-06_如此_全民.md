Such a "Mass" Movement

Feng Yonggui
Four Rivers and Eight Mountains Commune, Fuqin Brigade, Secretary of the Communist Youth League

Zhou Yang talks about the people, closes with the people, and says that literature and art should "reflect the interests of the entire people," acting as if he is speaking on behalf of the "people." However, his tricks cannot deceive us, the poor and lower-middle peasants. Zhou Yang maliciously slanders Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," claiming that in a socialist society, intellectuals, various democratic parties and personages, and the national bourgeoisie are all objects of service for revolutionary literature and art. He even openly demands that our literature and art should reflect their "interests," cater to their "tastes," and satisfy their "needs." I ask, what kind of proletarian literature and art is this? What kind of education can it bring to the workers, peasants, and soldiers?

A few years ago, under Zhou Yang's "guidance" of "mass literature and art," a large number of ghost plays emerged. As soon as the ghosts appeared on stage, the "ghosts" below the stage became active. In our brigade, a few landlords took the opportunity to talk about ghosts, make trouble with ghosts, and play tricks with ghosts, attempting to sabotage the people's commune. It is clear that the "people" Zhou Yang talks about are not the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, but the bourgeois elements, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

    如此“全民”
    四川成都营门口公社抚琴大队团总支书记  冯永贵
    周扬开口人民，闭口人民，说什么文艺要“反映全体人民的利益”，俨然是一副代表“人民”讲话的样子。但是，他这一套鬼把戏，骗不了我们贫下中农。周扬恶毒地诽谤毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》已经过时，他叫嚷：在社会主义社会，知识分子、各民主党派和民主人士、民族资产阶级，都是革命文艺服务的对象，而且公然要我们的文艺去反映他们的“兴趣”，迎合他们的“爱好”，满足他们的“需要”。试问，这是什么无产阶级的文艺？还能给工农兵带来什么教育？
    前几年，在周扬“全民文艺”的“指导”下，大批鬼戏纷纷出笼。戏台上的鬼一出现，戏台下的“鬼”也就活跃起来。我们大队有几个地主分子，趁机谈鬼、闹鬼、搞鬼，妄图破坏人民公社。十分清楚，周扬所说的“人民”，根本不是我们广大的工农兵群众，而是资产阶级分子，是地富反坏右。
