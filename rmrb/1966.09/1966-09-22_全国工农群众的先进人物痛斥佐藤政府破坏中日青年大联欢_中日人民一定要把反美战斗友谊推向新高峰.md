According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on September 21, advanced figures among workers and peasants in the capital and various regions have expressed their strong condemnation of the Sato government's unreasonable refusal to issue passports to Japanese youths coming to China. They have also expressed their warmest welcome to Japanese youth friends coming to China to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Festival.

Advanced figures among workers and peasants in the capital pointed out that the combat friendship between the peoples and youths of China and Japan, forged in the common struggle against American imperialism, is unbreakable by any reactionary forces. The evil activities of American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, along with their followers and accomplices, to obstruct and sabotage the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, will inevitably meet with thorough failure in the face of the struggle by Japanese youths and broad masses of people's organizations. Beijing's Eightli Village Store clerk Tao Yuzhen and Dongsheng People's Commune member Guo Yuxiu, who recently returned from a visit to Japan with the Chinese Youth Delegation, said that Chairman Mao pointed out, "All reactionaries are paper tigers." A handful of American and Japanese reactionaries attempt to sabotage the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Japan, but they will not succeed. The youths and peoples of China and Japan will unite more closely in the common struggle against American imperialism.

Shanghai's famous advanced producer and engineer, Wang Linhe, who is of worker origin, said that Chairman Mao taught us, "Except for the pro-American monopolistic capital and militarist warlords, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." We follow Chairman Mao's teachings and, with the broad masses of the Japanese people and youths, have established a combat friendship in the struggle against our common enemy, American imperialism. This friendship is becoming increasingly solid and strong. The sabotage and obstruction by the American and Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionists, and various new and old followers will only expose their ferocious faces and weak essence. Xiao Yinzhen, a young female worker from Shanghai's Quxin Shipbuilding Factory, exchanged views on studying Chairman Mao's works with Japanese youths during the First Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Festival. She said that with the great thought of Mao Zedong as our guide, our struggle will definitely be victorious.

Ma Xueli, an engineer from Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory, said that Chairman Mao taught us, "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The American and Japanese reactionaries' sabotage of the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Festival will only backfire.

During the First Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Festival last year, Zhang Dequan, a poor peasant and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from October People's Commune in the suburbs of Nanjing, had hosted Japanese youth friends in his home. Zhang Dequan said, "We warmly welcome Japanese youth friends to visit our commune again. Let us, the youths and peoples of China and Japan, strengthen our unity and strive together against our common enemy, American imperialism."

Du Zhaoshui, an active figure in socialist construction from Shenyang and a worker from Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, had given a book of Chairman Mao's poems to a Japanese friend during the first festival. The Japanese friend, upon receiving the gift, expressed his determination to always remember the sincere friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. Du Zhaoshui recalled this scene and hoped that Japanese youths would make up their minds, persist in their struggle, break through obstacles, and come to China as soon as possible. Together with Chinese youths and people, they will push the combat friendship against American imperialism to new heights.

    全国工农群众的先进人物痛斥佐藤政府破坏中日青年大联欢
    中日人民一定要把反美战斗友谊推向新高峰
    据新华社二十一日讯  首都和各地工农群众的先进人物，纷纷向本社记者发表谈话，表示最热烈地欢迎日本青年朋友前来我国参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢，对于日本佐藤政府悍然拒绝发给日本青年来华护照的无理行为，一致表示强烈的谴责。
    首都的工农先进人物指出，中日两国人民和青年在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊是任何反动势力也破坏不了的。美帝国主义和日本反动派及其追随者和合伙者阻挠和破坏中日两国人民友好的罪恶活动，必将在日本青年和广大群众团体斗争的面前，遭到彻底的失败。最近刚随中国青年代表团访问日本回来的北京八里庄商店售货员陶玉珍、北京市郊东升人民公社社员郭玉秀说，毛主席指出，“一切反动派都是纸老虎”，一小撮美日反动派妄想破坏中日两国人民的友好团结，是办不到的。中日青年和人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，必将更加紧密地团结起来。
    上海市著名的先进生产者、工人出身的工程师王林鹤说，毛主席教导我们：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”我们遵循毛主席的教导，同广大日本人民和青年在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中建立的战斗友谊，正在日益巩固和加强，美日反动派、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的新旧追随者的破坏和阻挠，只能暴露他们的狰狞面目和虚弱本质。上海求新造船厂青年女工萧引珍，在第一届中日青年友好大联欢时，曾同日本青年在一起交流学习毛主席著作的体会。她说，中日两国青年有伟大的毛泽东思想作指导，我们的斗争一定能取得胜利。
    武汉重型机床厂工人工程师马学礼说，毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美日反动派破坏中日青年友好大联欢，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    在去年举行第一届中日青年友好大联欢时，南京市郊十月人民公社贫农社员、学习毛主席著作积极分子张德全，曾经在自己家里接待过日本青年朋友。张德全说，我们热烈欢迎日本青年朋友们再一次来到我们公社做客。让我们中日两国青年和人民更好地加强团结，为反对我们共同的敌人美帝国主义而共同奋斗。
    沈阳市社会主义建设积极分子、沈阳重型机器厂工人杜昭水，在去年的第一届大联欢中，曾经把一本毛主席诗词赠送给一位日本朋友，这位日本朋友接过礼物后，表示要永远记住中国人民对日本人民的真挚情谊。杜昭水回忆起这段情景时，希望日本青年下定决心，坚持斗争，冲破障碍，尽快来到中国，同中国青年和人民一起，把共同反对美帝国主义的战斗友谊推向新的高峰。
