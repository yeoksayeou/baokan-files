On the evening of September 4, in the brightly lit Beijing Workers' Stadium, the scene of enthusiastic cheers for "Long Live the Great Thought of Mao Zedong" and the united singing of our most beloved leader Mao Zedong's praises in the song "The East Is Red" pushed the fervent emotions of the spectators at the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational to their highest point. Under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, our table tennis athletes, after eight days of arduous struggle, won six out of the seven events and five runner-up positions, once again bringing great honor to the people of our motherland. When they proudly held up the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and waved to the audience, thunderous applause and the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" resonated throughout the stadium, never ceasing.

Everyone knows that the Chinese table tennis team, renowned in the table tennis world, is not the first time to achieve such victories. However, the enthusiastic cheers this victory has aroused among the broad masses of spectators are rarely seen in previous competitions. Is this a coincidence? Of course not. The athletes of the Chinese table tennis team said well: "This is not an ordinary sports competition; this competition is another great victory for the thought of Mao Zedong!"

	We Must Fight with Style and Skill

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the athletes of the Chinese table tennis team have been fighting on the front lines to defend the thought of Mao Zedong. These young people, who have grown rapidly under the sun and rain of Mao Zedong's thought, quickly saw through the evil intentions of the class enemies who slandered them for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "vulgarization" and "pragmatism," and exposed the sinister goals of various ghosts and snakes opposing Mao Zedong's thought. Their indignation ignited a strong fighting spirit: "Defend the Party Central Committee to the death!" "Defend our most beloved leader Chairman Mao to the death!" "Defend the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong to the death!" They wrote big-character posters, held discussions, participated in struggle meetings, wrote articles for newspapers, and time and again launched fierce attacks on a handful of reactionary bourgeois rightists. The athletes were very clear that every bit of their progress and achievements sparkled with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong's thought and were real weapons to suppress the class enemies. Therefore, in mid-August, when the people of our motherland entrusted them with the glorious task of participating in the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational, everyone realized that this was a new battle. They were determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's thought in the competition, create even better results, and give the class enemies an even heavier blow!

	The Female Athlete Zheng Minzhi, who participated in this competition, once firmly declared: "We must fight with style and skill because we are new-type athletes nurtured by Mao Zedong's thought!"

	The athletes all expressed: We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in this competition, demonstrate the great victory of Mao Zedong's thought, and give those anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong thought bourgeois rightists a resounding slap in the face!

	The Same Voice Across the Nation

	The same voice appeared in the enthusiastic letters from the masses across the country to the table tennis athletes.

	One letter read: "We hope you will play well in the competition, fight for the laboring people, and give those anti-Party, anti-socialist elements a powerful rebuttal! Aren't the ghosts and snakes attacking the great thought of Mao Zedong? Aren't they slandering you and the workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying Chairman Mao's works as 'vulgarization' and 'pragmatism'? You should use new victories to demonstrate to these fellows: People armed with Mao Zedong's thought are the greatest fighting force, and the great thought of Mao Zedong is invincible and unconquerable!"

	Letter after letter filled with revolutionary passion expressed their limitless love for the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, and their deep hatred for the class enemies, reflecting the ardent expectations of the people across the nation for our table tennis athletes.

	After the invitational began, people's feelings became even more urgent. Although the masses could not compete on the field, they expressed their ardent expectations to their table tennis athletes through enthusiastic applause and by presenting the athletes with quotations from our most beloved leader Chairman Mao. The athletes competed on the field, and they cheered from the stands; when the competition was lost, they analyzed the reasons and offered suggestions; when the competition was won, they rejoiced and expressed congratulations. Even when our men's and women's teams won the first place in the group stage of the team competition, more than forty revolutionary teachers and students from a middle school in Shanghai sent a warm congratulatory letter, along with a commemorative badge with Chairman Mao's portrait. The letter read: "When you receive this precious gift, it will be as if you are seeing the great helmsman, the wise leader Chairman Mao; when you encounter difficulties, remember Chairman Mao's teachings, 'Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory'!" When the news of our men's and women's teams both winning the championship in the team competition spread, congratulatory telegrams and letters from many regions such as Guangxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet made the athletes' excited feelings reach their peak. These telegrams and letters, with countless words, all said one thing: Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's thought and march from victory to victory!

	Our beloved Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of all ethnic groups, and the great thought of Mao Zedong is the lifeblood of the Chinese people. What task is more glorious and sacred than defending Mao Zedong's thought? Zhou Lanxi said with deep emotion: "If we do not better read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we have no right to represent the Chinese people on the field!"

	The Battle Starts Here

	The ardent expectations and enthusiastic encouragement from the people across the nation were a great inspiration to the athletes, filling them with confidence to strive for victory. However, at the beginning, some were afraid of not playing well in the competition, disappointing the masses, and being criticized by the masses, so they felt burdened and pressured.

	At a meeting, Lu Jufang and Zhuang Zedong raised two thought-provoking questions.

	Lu Jufang said: "Why are we only afraid of not playing well and being criticized by the masses, and not afraid of playing well and being praised by the masses?"

	Zhuang Zedong said: "A soldier, before going into battle, does not think about how to win the battle but first worries about being defeated and sacrificed. What kind of soldier is this?"

	The two sharp questions touched the athletes' thoughts. They used Chairman Mao's teachings of "wholeheartedly serving the people" and "selflessly dedicating to the people" to examine themselves again, find their shortcomings, and realized that within the burden of fear, there was nothing but an "I." People realized that only by being selfless could they be fearless, and only by putting down the "I" could they put down the burden. This battle must start here. Therefore, the athletes participating in this competition were more serious than ever in studying Chairman Mao's works and consciously transforming their subjective world.

	Before this invitational, apart from necessary training, the athletes spent most of their time studying Chairman Mao's works and preparing mentally. They voluntarily brought out various thoughts, analyzed and categorized them, and then studied relevant quotations from Chairman Mao to solve them accurately. They went through self-examination, mutual help, discussions in meetings, and conversations after meetings, using Chairman Mao's teachings as the standard, bravely exposing and criticizing various errors in their thoughts. The athletes said that to defend Mao Zedong's thought, one must first let Mao Zedong's thought occupy one's own ideological position.

	Mao Zedong's Thought Is Forever the Banner of Victory

	The tenacious fighting spirit and excellent results shown by our table tennis athletes in the invitational fully demonstrated the great victory of Mao Zedong's thought.

	Even before the decisive battle between Chinese and Japanese athletes for the men's and women's team championships, the leader and coach of the Chinese table tennis team said to reporters when prospecting the situation: "Our table tennis team will definitely win. Because our athletes are armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, and the great thought of Mao Zedong is unconquerable and invincible!"

	Spectators who watched the competition all had a very clear impression: the Chinese table tennis athletes on the competition field were always in a spiritually dominant position. Excellent athletes like the "Little Tiger" Zhuang Zedong and the "Heavy Artillery" Zhou Lanxi, no matter how strong the opponents were, dared to despise them strategically, dared to fight, dared to struggle, and were good at fighting, showing courage and wisdom. They displayed the fearless and forward-looking revolutionary style of Chinese athletes nurtured under Mao Zedong's thought.

	Of course, it is often difficult to be an "undefeated general" in reality. Due to various reasons, losing a game or the entire match is common. The key is the attitude taken after a loss. Throughout the invitational, our female athletes Lin Huicheng and Zheng Minzhi, who performed very well, had records of failure in the competition. But afterwards, they immediately studied Chairman Mao's works with questions, finding answers, methods, confidence, and courage from the teachings of our great leader, seriously summing up experiences and lessons, and creating conditions for future victories.

	Now, the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational has concluded successfully, and our table tennis athletes have achieved brilliant results under the warm care and encouragement of the people across the nation. They held up the trophy with the Tiananmen Gate pattern and once again announced to all of China and the world that Mao Zedong's thought is forever the banner of victory.

### 战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁——记参加北京国际乒乓球邀请赛的中国队

    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁
    ——记参加北京国际乒乓球邀请赛的中国队
    九月四日晚，在灯火辉煌的北京工人体育馆，欢呼“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁”和齐声高唱我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的颂歌《东方红》的欢腾场面，把北京国际乒乓球邀请赛以来观众的热烈情绪推向了最高潮。在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的我国乒乓健儿，经过八天的艰苦奋战，获得了这次邀请赛全部七个项目中的六项冠军和五项亚军，又一次为祖国人民赢得了巨大的荣誉。当他们高高举起红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》向观众挥手致意的时候，暴风雨般的掌声和《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声响彻全场，经久不息。
    人们都知道，誉满乒坛的中国乒乓球队，远不是第一次赢得这样的胜利。但这个胜利在广大观众中所引起的热烈欢呼，却是以前历次比赛中少见的。难道这是偶然的吗？当然不是。中国乒乓球队的队员们说得好：“这不是普通的体育比赛，这场比赛是毛泽东思想的又一巨大胜利！”
    一定要打出风格打出水平
    自从无产阶级文化大革命以来，中国乒乓球队的健儿们就一直战斗在保卫毛泽东思想的第一线。这些在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露下迅速成长起来的年轻人，很快就认清了阶级敌人诬蔑他们活学活用毛主席著作是“庸俗化”“实用主义”的恶毒嘴脸，看穿了各种牛鬼蛇神反对毛泽东思想的罪恶目的，满腔的怒火激发了他们强烈的战斗决心：“誓死保卫党中央！”“誓死保卫最敬爱的领袖毛主席！”“誓死保卫伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想！”他们写大字报，开座谈会，参加斗争会，给报刊写文章，一次又一次地向一小撮反动的资产阶级右派分子猛烈开火。运动员们很清楚，自己的每一点进步和成绩，都闪烁着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，又都是讨伐阶级敌人的真枪实弹。因此八月中旬，当祖国人民把参加北京国际乒乓球邀请赛的光荣任务交给他们的时候，每个人都意识到这是一场新的战斗，决心在比赛中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，创造出更优异的成绩，给阶级敌人以更加沉重的打击！
    参加这次比赛的女运动员郑敏之，就曾这样斩钉截铁地表示：“我们一定要打出风格，打出水平，因为我们是毛泽东思想培育出来的新型运动员！”
    运动员们都表示：一定要在这次比赛中更好地活学活用毛主席著作，显示出毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，给那些反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的资产阶级右派分子一个响亮的耳光！
    全国人民一个心愿
    同样的声音出现在全国各地群众给乒乓健儿热情洋溢的来信中。
    一封来信写道：“希望你们打好比赛，为劳动人民争气，给那些反党反社会主义分子一个有力的回击！牛鬼蛇神不是攻击伟大的毛泽东思想吗？不是诬蔑你们和工农兵群众学习毛主席著作是‘庸俗化’‘实用主义’吗？你们应该用新的胜利向这些家伙们示威：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力，伟大的毛泽东思想是战无不胜，攻无不克的！”
    一封封充满革命激情的来信，表示了对伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席的无限热爱和对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，表达了全国人民对我国乒乓健儿的殷切期望。
    邀请赛开幕以后，人们的这种心情变得更加急切。广大群众虽然不能上场比赛，但他们在热烈的掌声中，在给乒乓球运动员赠送我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席的语录时，时时都把殷切期望转达给自己的乒乓健儿。运动员在场上比赛，他们在场外使劲；比赛失利，他们分析原因，提出建议；比赛取胜，他们欢欣鼓舞，表示祝贺。还在我男、女队获得团体赛小组第一名时，上海一个中学四十多名革命师生就写来了一封热情的贺信，随信还寄来了镶有毛主席头像的一枚光芒四射的纪念章。贺信写道：“你们收到这份宝贵的礼物，就会像看见伟大舵手、英明领袖毛主席一样；你们碰到困难的时候，就记着毛主席的教导，‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利’！”到了团体赛结束，我男女队双获冠军的喜讯传出以后，来自广西、青海、新疆、西藏等许多地区的贺电、贺信，使运动员们激动的心情达到了顶点。这些贺电、贺信，千言万语并作一句：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从胜利走向胜利！
    敬爱的毛主席是各族人民心中的红太阳，伟大的毛泽东思想是中国人民的命根子，还有什么任务比保卫毛泽东思想更光荣、更神圣？周兰荪无限感慨地说：“如果我们不更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，就没有资格代表中国人民出场！”
    战斗从这里打响
    全国人民的殷切期望和热情鼓励，对运动员们是一个很大的鼓舞，使他们充满了争取胜利的信心。但在开始时，也有人怕打不好比赛，辜负群众的希望，受到群众的批评，因此感到包袱很重，压力很大。
    在一次会上，陆巨芳、庄则栋就提出了两个发人深思的问题。
    陆巨芳说：“为什么只害怕打不好会受到群众批评，就不害怕打好了群众表扬呢？”
    庄则栋说：“一个战士在上阵以前，不去想怎么把仗打好，而是先顾虑打败仗牺牲了怎么办，这叫什么样的战士？”
    两个尖锐的问题，触动了运动员们的思想。他们拿毛主席的“全心全意地为人民服务”和“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，又一次给自己照镜子，找差距，发现在“怕”的包袱里面，原来装的不是别的，还是一个“我”字。人们意识到，无私才能无畏，放下“我”字才能放下包袱，这场战斗必须从这里打响。因此参加这次比赛的运动员比任何时候都更加认真地学习毛主席著作，更加自觉地进行主观世界的改造。
    在这次邀请赛之前，除了必要的练习之外，运动员们把绝大部分时间都用在学习毛主席著作和进行思想准备上。他们自觉地把各式各样的活思想摆出来，加以分析归类，然后学习毛主席的有关语录，有的放矢，正确地加以解决。他们通过自我检查，互相帮助，会上讨论，会下交谈，以毛主席的教导为准则，勇敢地暴露和批判自己思想上的各种错误。运动员们说，为了保卫毛泽东思想，就必须让毛泽东思想首先占领自己的思想阵地。
    毛泽东思想永远是胜利的旗帜
    我国乒乓健儿在邀请赛中表现出来的顽强的战斗精神和所取得的优异成绩，充分显示了毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    还在中日选手争夺男女团体冠军的决战前夕，中国乒乓球队的领队和教练在展望战局的时候就曾对记者说：“我国乒乓球队一定能够取得胜利。因为我们的队员是用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的，而伟大的毛泽东思想是攻无不克、战无不胜的！”
    看过比赛的观众都有一个很鲜明的印象，即：比赛场上的我国乒乓健儿总是在精神上占着压倒的优势。“小老虎”庄则栋、“重炮手”周兰荪等优秀运动员，不论遇到怎样强大的对手，都敢于在战略上藐视，敢打，敢拚，而又善于斗争，有勇有谋，表现了毛泽东思想哺育下的中国运动员无所畏惧、一往无前的革命风貌。
    当然，事实上的“常胜将军”往往是很难做到的。由于种种原因，输掉一局甚至全盘，也是常有的事，问题是在失利后采取什么态度。在整个邀请赛中成绩很好的我国女选手林慧卿、郑敏之，在比赛中都曾经有过失败的纪录。但事后她们立即带着问题学习毛主席著作，从我们伟大领袖的教导中找答案、找办法、找信心、找勇气，认真总结经验教训，为今后获得新的胜利创造条件。
    现在，北京国际乒乓球邀请赛圆满地结束了，我国乒乓健儿在全国人民的热情关怀、鼓励下取得了辉煌战果。他们举起刻有天安门图案的奖杯，向全中国、全世界又一次宣布毛泽东思想永远是胜利的旗帜。
