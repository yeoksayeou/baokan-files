	Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the revolutionary people.

	“Imprint Chairman Mao’s instructions in your mind, dissolve them in your blood, and implement them in your actions.”

	This is a language filled with revolutionary passion for the great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	The comrades of the 32111 Drilling Team said this and did this.

	In a sudden blaze, the derrick collapsed, trees were charred, and rocks were red-hot. However, the heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought, their red hearts were indestructible. Without orders, Mao Zedong Thought is the order. Everyone rushed fearlessly into the inferno. Where it was most dangerous, they rushed in; where it was crucial, they charged ahead. One person fell, more people rushed forward. They were willing to sacrifice everything for themselves but would not abandon the state’s property and the people’s interests. Thus, they extinguished a raging fire with their lives and blood, writing a new chapter in the annals of Chinese heroes.

	They are the collective Huang Jiguang, the collective Qiu Shaoyun, the collective Ouyang Hai, the collective Mai Xiande. In them, the revolutionary qualities of the working class and the great Mao Zedong Thought are embodied.

	Comrade Mao Zedong said: The correct thoughts representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world. The heroic deeds of this drilling team once again prove this unshakable truth.

	Mao Zedong Thought is the correct thought representing the most advanced class—the proletariat. It is the most powerful ideological weapon for the proletariat’s march towards communism and the contemporary Marxism-Leninism for transforming people’s souls.

	The transformation of souls is a struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews, a profound ideological revolution. Our work, in the end, boils down to one thing: using Mao Zedong Thought to transform people’s souls and using Mao Zedong Thought to eliminate the influence of exploitative class ideology in people’s minds. Once the people grasp this powerful ideological weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, they can change the heavens and the earth, create miracles. Imperialism, revisionism, reactionaries, ghosts and monsters, and all difficulties and obstacles will be nothing.

	The heroic deeds of this drilling team emerged in the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, which is not accidental. It is like a red signal flare, announcing to the people: With the deepening of the Cultural Revolution and the arrival of a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, the people of our country will surely appear in the Eastern continent with even more magnificent proletarian revolutionary heroic images.

	The people of the entire country should learn from the heroic 32111 Drilling Team. We should, like them, regard reading Chairman Mao’s books as the first necessity of life, turn Mao Zedong Thought into our souls, make the execution of Chairman Mao’s instructions into conscious actions, and regard revolutionary interests as our first life.

	Let us hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the heroes’ thoughts, walk the heroes’ path, create heroic achievements, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, striving for new victories in socialist revolution and socialist construction!

### 毛泽东思想是革命人民的灵魂

    毛泽东思想是革命人民的灵魂
    “把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”
    这是对伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想充满革命激情的语言。
    32111钻井队的同志们这样说了，也这样做了。
    在一场突然爆发的烈火中，井架烧倒了，树木烧焦了，岩石烧红了，但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄，他们的颗颗红心，是烧不毁的。没有命令，毛泽东思想就是命令。所有的人都奋不顾身，冲向火海。那里最危险，就往那里冲，那里是关键，就往那里闯。一个人倒下来，更多的人冲上去。他们宁可舍弃自己的一切，不肯舍弃国家的财产，人民的利益。就这样，他们用生命和鲜血扑灭了一场冲天大火，在中华儿女的英雄史册上写下了最新的一章。
    他们是集体的黄继光，集体的邱少云，集体的欧阳海，集体的麦贤得。在他们身上，集中体现了工人阶级的革命品质和伟大毛泽东思想的结合。
    毛泽东同志说：代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。这个钻井队的英雄行为，再一次证明了这个颠扑不破的真理。
    毛泽东思想，就是代表最先进的阶级——无产阶级的正确思想，是无产阶级向共产主义进军的最强大的思想武器，是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义。
    灵魂的改造，是无产阶级和资产阶级两种世界观的搏斗，是一场艰巨的思想革命。我们的工作千条万条，归根到底，就是一条：用毛泽东思想改造人的灵魂，用毛泽东思想扫除人们头脑里的剥削阶级思想的影响。亿万人民掌握了毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器，就能够改天换地，创造奇迹。什么帝国主义，什么修正主义，什么反动派，什么牛鬼蛇神，什么艰难险阻，统统不在话下。
    这个钻井队的英雄事迹，出现在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，决不是偶然的。它像一颗红色信号弹，向人们宣告：随着文化大革命的深入发展，随着活学活用毛主席著作新高潮的到来，我国人民必将以更加高大的无产阶级革命英雄形象，出现在东方大陆上。
    全国人民都应当向英雄的32111钻井队学习。要像他们那样，把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动，把革命的利益当成自己的第一生命。
    让我们高高举起毛泽东思想鲜红的旗帜，学英雄的思想，走英雄的道路，创英雄的业绩，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，争取社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新胜利！
