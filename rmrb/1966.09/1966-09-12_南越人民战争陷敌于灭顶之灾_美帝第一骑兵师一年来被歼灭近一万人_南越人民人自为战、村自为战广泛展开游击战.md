The U.S. First Cavalry Division, which has been heavily hyped by the Johnson administration, has been sent to the South Vietnamese battlefield since last September. In the past year, it has been burned to a crisp in the fires of the people's war in South Vietnam, suffering nearly 10,000 casualties, almost half of the division's total strength. Among them, three entire battalions and fifteen entire companies have been annihilated, and various types of aircraft have been lost, totaling 482. Many vehicles have also been destroyed.

Last September, this so-called "elite" U.S. force was sent to the central midlands of South Vietnam, establishing a base in An Khe at the junction of the Central Highlands and the central midlands plain. They attempted to occupy the strategic locations of Kon Tum and Gia Lai provinces in the northern Central Highlands, and Phu Yen and Binh Dinh provinces in the central midlands plain, aiming to split the central midlands battlefield and extricate themselves from the predicament of consecutive defeats suffered by the U.S.-puppet forces in the central midlands. However, this U.S. "ace" unit, upon setting foot on South Vietnamese soil, found itself mired in the vast sea of the people's war, constantly on the defensive, fighting a losing battle. Its three major "sweeping" operations all ended in failure.

The U.S. First Cavalry Division is the unit with the most helicopters in the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam. The U.S. aggressors attempted to use helicopters for "highly mobile" troop movements to compete with the mobile and flexible South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces.

The fact that the U.S. First Cavalry Division has suffered continuous defeats over the past year once again proves that the decisive factor in determining the outcome of a war is people, not weapons. No matter how advanced the equipment of the U.S. aggressors' unjust forces, they cannot withstand the invincible power of the people's war in South Vietnam.

According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians of An Tinh commune in South Vietnam's Ninh Thuan Province have unleashed the mighty power of the people's war, widely launching guerrilla warfare. Since the beginning of this year, they have eliminated nearly 700 enemy troops, including nearly 600 U.S. aggressors, destroyed 37 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, and shot down or damaged 11 enemy aircraft.

An Tinh commune is located beside Highway 1, about four kilometers from the city of Tuy Hoa. Due to the thriving guerrilla movement, the enemy's main transportation lifeline and nearby outposts have been seriously threatened. U.S.-puppet military convoys are frequently ambushed, suffering heavy losses. It is also reported that recently, guerrilla forces in various parts of South Vietnam have launched consecutive attacks, dealing heavy blows to the enemy.

On the evening of September 5, the Saigon-Tan Son Nhat area guerrilla forces ambushed a group of puppet troops outside Saigon, eliminating a batch of enemies. In the afternoon of the 6th, the guerrilla forces attacked enemy positions near the new mountain airport in the suburbs of Saigon, destroying a communication station of the puppet regime.

According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the guerrilla forces and local forces in the southern region of South Vietnam's Quang Nam Province, in order to support the liberation army's battle in the Khe Sanh area, launched more than 100 attacks on the enemy from August 5 to 15, eliminating 518 U.S.-puppet troops, including 350 U.S. aggressors.

They also shot down 10 helicopters, destroyed and damaged three M-113 type armored vehicles and one transport truck, and seized a large number of firearms, ammunition, and military supplies.

    南越人民战争陷敌于灭顶之灾
    美帝第一骑兵师一年来被歼灭近一万人
    南越人民人自为战、村自为战广泛展开游击战
    新华社河内十一日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道：被约翰逊政府大肆吹捧的美国侵略军第一骑兵师从去年九月派到南越战场后，一年来，在越南南方人民战争的火海中被烧得焦头烂额，损兵折将近一万名，占这个师的全部兵力的近一半。其中被全歼的有三个整营和十五个整连，各种飞机损失达四百八十二架，还有许多军车被摧毁。
    去年九月，这支美国所谓最“精锐”的部队被派到南越中部中区的战场，在西原与中部中区平原的交界处安溪建立基地，妄图进占西原北部的昆嵩、嘉莱两省和中部中区平原的富安、平定两省的战略要地，实现分割中部中区战场的阴谋，以摆脱美伪军在中部中区战场连遭失败的窘境。但是，这支美国“王牌”军一踏上越南南方土地就陷入了人民战争的汪洋大海里，到处被动挨打，疲于奔命。它的三次大规模“扫荡”都以惨败告终。
    美军第一骑兵师是侵越美军中配备直升飞机最多的一个师。美国侵略者妄图用直升飞机来“高度机动”地调动兵力，同机动灵活的越南南方解放武装力量较量。
    美军第一骑兵师一年来连遭失败的事实又一次证明，决定战争胜负的因素是人而不是武器。美国侵略者的不义之师，不管装备如何精良，也抵挡不住南越人民战争的无敌威力。
    据新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方西宁省安静乡军民发挥人民战争的巨大威力，广泛开展游击战争，从今年年初以来，共消灭敌人近七百名，其中美国侵略军近六百名，击毁敌人坦克和装甲车三十七辆，击落和击伤敌机十一架。
    安静乡位于第一号公路旁，离盏盆县城约四公里，由于游击运动的蓬勃发展，敌人的主要交通命脉和附近的据点遭到严重威胁，美伪军的车队经常被伏击，损失巨大。另据报道，越南南方各地游击队最近接连出击，给敌人以沉重打击。
    西贡—堤岸区游击队，九月五日晚间，在西贡市外围地区截击一股伪军，消灭一批敌人。六日下午，游击队又进攻西贡郊区新山一机场附近的敌人，摧毁伪政权的一个通讯站。
    据新华社河内十日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广南省南部地区的游击队和地方部队，为配合解放军在桂山地区的战斗，从八月五日到十五日接连向各地敌人发动了一百多次进攻，共消灭美伪军五百一十八名，其中包括美国侵略军三百五十名。
    他们还击落直升飞机十架，击毁和击伤M—113型装甲车三辆和运输卡车一辆，并且缴获大批枪支、弹药和军用物资。（附图片）
