In a certain border defense unit in Tibet, there is a moving story about a Tibetan soldier who, despite being illiterate, diligently and persistently studies Chairman Mao's works.

This soldier is named Qiren Qiongpei.

Last autumn, like other new soldiers, he joined the ranks of the People's Liberation Army of China with boundless admiration.

In this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the first lesson he learned was "In Memory of Norman Bethune." After the instructor finished the class, the soldiers began to read aloud. Qiren Qiongpei, who had never read a book before, was so anxious that sweat poured down his face. Deputy Instructor Dazha Xi walked over and kindly said to him, "Chairman Mao's books are 'treasure books,' every sentence is the truth of revolution. To revolutionize, one must read Chairman Mao's books. Without reading Chairman Mao's books, it's like a blind man walking, unable to take a single step." The deputy instructor also told him, "The road ahead is arduous, and while you study Chairman Mao's works, you must also overcome the barrier of illiteracy."

Qiren Qiongpei was naturally delighted to learn to read and write. Why was he illiterate? This question stirred up a series of memories:

Before liberation, on a snowy night, his mother led him and his seven siblings out of the lord's house. The wind and snow were fierce, and the tattered sheep skins they wore could not keep out the cold. Between freezing and starvation, three of his brothers and one younger sister died in a few days. Later, he played the erhu and begged on the streets of Shigatse, living a subhuman life.

Thinking about this, tears welled up in his eyes. His intense hatred for the evil feudal serf system and his boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao made him unable to calm down. He thought: Without the Party and Chairman Mao, how could there be a Qiren Qiongpei today? Chairman Mao's kindness is higher than the Himalayas and longer than the Yarlung Zangbo River! He wiped his tears and firmly said: If not Chairman Mao's books, whose books should I read? If not Chairman Mao's words, whose words should I listen to? I will definitely follow him and make a revolution for life.

With a strong desire to read the "treasure books" for the revolution, Qiren Qiongpei began his studies. He bought a notebook and asked his comrades to write "Long Live Chairman Mao" on the first page and "Serve the People Wholeheartedly" on the second page. From then on, he studied wherever he went. During rest times, he would sit down and trace the characters with his fingers. During breaks in training, he would hold his gun in one hand and practice writing "Long Live Chairman Mao" on the hard ground with the other, his index finger bleeding, so he used his middle finger to trace. On snowy days, with the ground covered in white, he practiced on the snow. When his hands froze, he would blow on them and rub them to continue practicing, finally able to write "Long Live Chairman Mao" in neat characters. At this moment, he was overjoyed and couldn't help shouting, "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

Qiren Qiongpei then began to study other works by Chairman Mao, which brought him even greater difficulties. The instructor found him, pointing to "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and said, "You start with this one." He then read it to him word by word and explained it to him, finally telling him that in the face of difficulties, one must have the spirit of moving mountains like the Foolish Old Man to emerge victorious. After returning to the squad, he again asked his comrades to read to him, and he followed along, reading word by word. He thought: The Foolish Old Man had the determination to move the mountains, and as a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, I should have even greater aspirations. He compared himself to the Foolish Old Man and culture to the mountains, determined to overcome the barrier of illiteracy.

From then on, he never parted with his books, always carrying Chairman Mao's works in his pocket, asking everyone he met to help him read, and studying whenever he had the chance. He even asked the "Little Red Guards" to teach him. Some of the Little Red Guards, seeing him so diligent in reading Chairman Mao's books, were deeply moved and eagerly taught him to read and write. To practice writing better, Qiren Qiongpei made a wooden pen about five or six inches long, with "Study Culture for the Revolution" carved on it. He used this pen to practice writing on the ground and sand. Over time, it wore down to only two or three inches long. The soldiers were all moved by Qiren Qiongpei's spirit of diligently studying Chairman Mao's works, and they all respectfully said: Qiren Qiongpei wore down a wooden pen, but he gained the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Qiren Qiongpei not only read Chairman Mao's books whenever he had the chance but also turned many of Chairman Mao's words into songs, singing them day and night. Over time, he memorized many of Chairman Mao's words and used them to guide his thoughts and actions. He said, "One's life should be like Zhang Side's, serving the people wholeheartedly; like Norman Bethune, benefiting others without benefiting oneself; like moving mountains, facing difficulties."

This year in April, a drought hit the Tibetan Plateau, and the vegetables the troops planted were withering day by day. Qiren Qiongpei was restless, braving the scorching sun and enduring hardships to cross mountains and valleys in search of water sources. The local villagers saw that the troops' vegetables were about to die from the drought and decided to give up a day's water to the troops for irrigation. Qiren Qiongpei insisted on not accepting it. He pointed to the cracked barley and said, "Your fields also need water!" Both sides pushed and pulled, and finally, Qiren Qiongpei agreed to irrigate for one night. That night, water gushed into the fields. Soon, the dike was breached. In front of him was one drop of water for one plant! He couldn't let the water go to waste! Qiren Qiongpei dashed over and took off his overcoat to block the breach. It didn't work, so he took off his wool sweater and stuffed it in, but it still didn't work. Finally, he lay down on the breach. When the soldiers rushed over and blocked the water, he crawled out, his body covered in mud and water, but his Chairman Mao's works were clean and intact. Everyone looked at him in amazement, and he laughed heartily, saying, "Before I went into the water, I put it on a pile of dirt. Chairman Mao's books are our lifeline! We can die, we can shed blood, but we can't lose Chairman Mao's 'treasure books'!"

In studying Chairman Mao's works, Qiren Qiongpei achieved a double harvest in politics and culture.

Now, he can read "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" in one breath, and he acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions everywhere. He is determined not only to be a promoter of the domestic revolution but also a promoter of the world revolution. In less than a year, he went from an ordinary soldier of serf origin to a squad leader and was honored to join the Communist Party of China in August, becoming a revolutionary soldier of the proletariat. People praised him endlessly, saying: Qiren Qiongpei is another strong revolutionary successor nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought.

    干革命就要读毛主席的书
    ——记藏族战士次仁穷沛刻苦学习毛主席著作的动人事迹
    在西藏某边防部队里，流传着一个不识字的藏族战士，刻苦、勤奋学习毛主席著作的动人故事。
    这个战士叫次仁穷沛。
    去年秋天，他同其他新战士一样，以无限敬慕的心情，走进了中国人民解放军的行列。
    他在解放军这个毛泽东思想大学校里学的第一课，就是《为人民服务》。指导员讲完课，战士们朗读起来，从未读过书的次仁穷沛急得满头是汗。副指导员大扎西走过来，亲切地对他说：“毛主席的书是‘宝书’，句句是革命的道理，干革命就要读毛主席的书。不读毛主席的书，好比盲人走路，寸步难行。”副指导员还告诉他：“摆在你面前的道路很艰巨，你在学习毛主席著作的同时，还要突破文化这个难关。”
    学文化，次仁穷沛自然高兴。为什么一字不识？倒引起他一连串的回忆：
    解放前，一个风雪交加的夜晚，阿妈领着他们兄弟姊妹八个，逃出了领主的家门。当时，风雪很大，他们身上披的破羊皮不能挡风避寒，连冻加饿，没几天三个哥哥、一个小妹妹死去了。后来，他拉二胡在日喀则沿街乞讨，过着非人的生活。
    他想着想着，热泪夺眶而出。无比憎恨万恶的封建农奴制度，无限热爱党和毛主席的激情，使他久久不能平静。他想：没有党和毛主席，那有次仁穷沛的今天啊！毛主席的恩情真比喜马拉雅山还高，比雅鲁藏布江还长呵！他揩干眼泪，斩钉截铁地说：我不读毛主席的书读谁的书？我不听毛主席的话听谁的话？我一定跟他老人家闹一辈子革命。
    次仁穷沛怀着为革命读“宝书”的强烈愿望开始了学习。他买了一个笔记本，请战友把“毛主席万岁”写在第一页上，把“全心全意为人民服务”写在第二页上。从此，他走到哪里学到哪里。劳动休息时，他一屁股坐在地上，用手指头一笔一笔地划着。操练间隙，他一手拿枪，一手在坚硬的土地上练写“毛主席万岁”，食指磨出了血，就用中指划。下雪天，大地一片银白，他就在雪上练，手冻僵了，呵一呵，搓一搓继续练，终于练得能端端正正地写出“毛主席万岁”五个大字。这时，他高兴极了，情不自禁地喊起“毛主席万岁！”
    次仁穷沛接着学习毛主席有关著作，这给他带来了更大的困难。指导员找到他，指着《愚公移山》说：
  “你先学这一本。”接着，逐字逐句地念给他听，讲给他听，最后告诉他，在困难面前，要有愚公移山的精神才能战而胜之。回班以后，他又请战友念，自己跟着一字一句地朗读，他想：愚公有搬走大山的决心，我这个解放军战士更应该有雄心壮志。他把自己比做愚公，把文化比做大山，下定决心立下愚公移山志，攻破文化困难关。
    打这以后，他人不离书，书不离人，他把毛主席著作经常装在军衣口袋里，逢人便问，有空就学，连
  “红领巾”他也不放过请他们当老师。有些红领巾见他这样勤奋地读毛主席的书，很受感动，热心地教他读，把着手教他写。为了更好地练字，次仁穷沛做了一支五六寸长的圆木头笔，上边刻着“为革命学文化”几个字。他用这支笔在地上、沙滩上练字，天长日久，磨得只剩下两三寸长了。战士们都为次仁穷沛刻苦学习毛主席著作的精神所感动，大家都敬佩地说：次仁穷沛磨掉的是一支木笔，得到的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。次仁穷沛不仅一有空就读毛主席的书，而且他把毛主席的许多话当成山歌唱，天天唱，时时唱，久而久之，毛主席的好多话他都背得滚瓜烂熟，并且用这些话来指导自己的思想和行动。他说：
  “自己的一生应该是：像张思德那样全心全意为人民服务；像白求恩那样专门利人毫不利己；像愚公移山那样对待困难。”
    今年四月，西藏高原遇到了干旱，部队种的蔬菜一天天地枯黄。次仁穷沛成天坐卧不安，冒着烈日，不辞艰辛，翻山越岭寻找水源。驻地附近的老乡看见部队种的菜快要旱死了，决定让出一天的水来给部队浇灌，次仁穷沛说什么也不接受。他指着裂开了口的青稞地说：“你们地里也需要水哩！”双方推让不下，最后次仁穷沛才答应浇一个晚上。晚上，水哗哗地涌向地里。不一会，水堤被冲垮了。眼前是一滴水一棵菜啊！不能让水白白浪费掉！次仁穷沛一个箭步窜上去，把身上穿的大衣脱下来堵在缺口上，堵不住，他又把身上的绒衣脱下来塞上，还是堵不住，最后，他干脆躺在缺口上，等战士们赶到把水堵住后才爬出来，他浑身上下都是泥和水，但他的毛主席著作却干干净净，完好无损。人们都惊奇地望着他，他乐呵呵地说：“我下水前把它放到土堆上了。毛主席的书是咱们穷人的命根子呀！头可断，血可流，毛主席的‘宝书’可不能丢啊！”
    次仁穷沛在学习毛主席著作中，获得了政治、文化双丰收。
    现在，《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和《中国社会各阶级的分析》他都能一口气读下来，而且处处按毛主席指示去做，他决心不仅要当国内革命促进派，而且要当世界革命的促进派。在不到一年的时间里，他由一个农奴出身的普通战士，当了班长，今年八月又光荣地加入了中国共产党，成了一个无产阶级的革命战士。人们赞不绝口地说：次仁穷沛是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的又一个坚强的革命接班人。
