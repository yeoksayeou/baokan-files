This news report is very moving. After the unfortunate death of elderly poor peasant Li Fari's son in a car accident, he put the interests of the Party and the state first, and the interests of the people first. With deep class feelings, he correctly handled this unfortunate incident, and was praised by the broad masses. The reason Li Fari has such a noble spiritual realm is that he can study and apply Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. His moving deeds shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

In Dazhaiping Commune, Dongzhangcun Brigade, Linyi County, Shandong Province, elderly poor peasant Li Fari has undergone tremendous and profound changes in his spiritual world by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. His correct handling of the incident where his son was run over by a car is a very vivid example of this change.

A Heart-Moving Class Sentiment

Li Fari is 56 years old. His second son, Li Zhiai, was unfortunately run over by a car on the road to Linyi City. After the incident, the main leaders of the Linyi Automobile Transport Company went to the scene and discussed with the cadres of Dongzhangcun Brigade how to comfort and compensate the deceased's family and how to bury the deceased. The Automobile Transport Company felt sorry for the deceased, and the brigade cadres also felt they couldn't report this unfortunate accident to Comrade Li. After Li Fari arrived at the scene, passersby were discussing the matter: some blamed the driver, some blamed the deceased, and a few took the opportunity to stir up trouble. However, after Comrade Li surveyed the scene, he calmly said: "This incident cannot be entirely blamed on the driver; it was my son who made a mistake in avoiding the car. My son was only 26 years old and still young; he has already died, so we shouldn't blame him anymore. It's all my fault as a father for not educating him enough." "In the old society, the Nationalists' cars would run over people as if they were running over a dog. In the new society, running over an ordinary peasant, the leaders are so concerned, coming in person to handle the matter, and even to comfort me. I am sad, but I am also moved. I only hope the leaders won't be troubled and that we can quickly bury him, as it's not good to stop here."

Comrade Li's sincere class sentiment calmed the discussions at the scene.

Stand Firm, Unshakable

There are classes, and there is class struggle. Most people in Dongzhangcun could correctly handle this incident, but a few reactionary elements tried every means to sabotage it. Some went to Comrade Li's house, pointing at the damaged bicycle and saying: "You should demand compensation for the bicycle!" "You should demand compensation for your son!" "You can't just let it go like this!" However, Comrade Li, who reads Chairman Mao's books and listens to Chairman Mao's words, stood firm and unshakable. He told the Party branch that he would not fall for the trick of the bad elements. He said: "I only listen to Chairman Mao's words and the Party's words. Chairman Mao said, countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person's heart ache when they think of them. Can we still have personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, and mistakes that we cannot abandon? I am a sufferer; for three generations, we have escaped famines. At the age of seven, I sold tofu and even lost the basket but still couldn't earn enough to eat. Now, my four sons and one daughter have all studied after liberation. Without the Communist Party, not only would they not be able to study, but they might not even be able to live to this day. Without the Party, without the state, without the company's cars, we wouldn't be able to bring water from the Yi River, transport fertilizer, eat rice, wear fine cloth, or hang mosquito nets. My son died, and I am sad, but when I think of these things, my heart steadies, and I will not fall for the trick of the bad elements."

"I Only Rely on the Communist Party, I Will Not Rely on Compensation to Live"

After the incident, the Automobile Transport Company sent people to visit the elderly several times. The brigade Party branch and the surrounding masses were also very caring. The company even sent compensation money to the elderly. How did Comrade Li handle the compensation? He said: "I appreciate the Party's intentions. My son died, and the leaders have already been troubled. I only accept the Party's intentions and absolutely cannot spend the state's money." When comrades repeatedly persuaded him to accept the compensation, he said: "Money is a small matter, revolution is a big matter. As long as there is a great Party, a great leader Chairman Mao, a great state, and a great socialist society, we poor and lower-middle peasants will have everything. With the Party, not only will there be no difficulties, but even if there are difficulties, the Party will still take care of us. I only rely on the Communist Party and will not rely on compensation to live." The compensation was sent back and forth four times, but Comrade Li still refused to accept it. He said excitedly: "I accept the Party's intentions. But this money, please support the people in the disaster-stricken areas. This is my intention, please accept it on behalf of the Party!"

"You Must Always Listen to Chairman Mao's Words"

The leader of the Automobile Transport Company once expressed to Comrade Li: after the accident, they would educate all drivers and staff to learn from the lesson and give the driver who caused the accident the appropriate punishment according to the regulations. When Comrade Li learned that the driver who caused the accident, Ming Xinxian, was from a poor peasant background and had participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, he became uneasy. He decided to go to the transport company. The secretary and manager of the company warmly received him. Comrade Li wanted to see the driver first. After meeting, he asked: "Was the car driven by you that day?" The driver answered: "Yes." Comrade Li saw that the driver was both sad and nervous, so he said: "Child, don't be afraid. Our company is led by the Party, and you and I are also led by the Party. We are both poor peasants and are one family. Zhiai was young and just got married. I carried him on my back when he was a child. He died, and I cannot be unmoved and not sad. But in the old society, not only would you not be forgiven for running over my son, but even if you ran over your own brother or father, you would not be lightly forgiven. Even if your father forgave you, your wife would not forgive you. But now it is a new society, and we are truly one family, so we cannot use old methods to handle this matter. As long as everyone can learn from the lesson and do revolution well, and not have accidents again, that will be good. Moreover, Zhiai died, and you are my son." These words deeply moved the driver and all the comrades present. The driver immediately reflected on himself, saying that he had not seen clearly that day and thought there were few people on the road, so he drove too fast, causing the car to not stop in time. He said he was willing to accept any punishment from the organization and remember this lesson and Comrade Li's teachings. Comrade Li finally said: "I only have one word: you must learn from Lei Feng, learn from Wang Jie, always listen to the Party's words, and always listen to Chairman Mao's words!"

The Linyi Automobile Company, based on the circumstances of the accident at that time and Comrade Li's repeated requests, reduced the punishment for the driver who caused the accident, Ming Xinxian. Comrade Li's sublime thoughts on handling this incident were seen and remembered by Ming Xinxian. He saved money and sent 15 yuan to Comrade Li, affectionately calling Comrade Li's elderly couple "father and mother." The Dongzhangcun Brigade Party branch received it and was worried that Comrade Li would not accept it. But Comrade Li said: "Since it is sent by a son, how can a father not accept it!" He also said: "He also has children to raise, and food may not be abundant, so I want to send him rice. A father sending rice to his son, the son will definitely not refuse. But tell him not to send money again in the future, and to work hard, like Jiao Yulu, to devote himself to the revolution and the people, which is a million times better than sending me 100 yuan or 1,000 yuan." "You must help him study Chairman Mao's works well."

After some time, his daughter-in-law Xianying's sister from her maternal home introduced a match for Xianying. Xianying asked the Party branch how to handle this matter. She said her feelings were very conflicted, and she really didn't want to leave her in-laws who were good to her. The Party branch thought she was still young and should remarry, but they were afraid Comrade Li would be heartbroken. So, they asked the Women's Federation chairperson to go with her to talk. As soon as they arrived, the old man understood. He told Xianying: "You are young and have no children, so you should go. After you leave, you are not my daughter-in-law, but you can still be my daughter. You want anything, and I will give you anything." He immediately gave the 15 yuan sent by Ming Xinxian to Xianying. Xianying was moved to tears and said she didn't want anything, and the money and things should be left for her younger siblings. After Xianying was taken away by her sister, the old man was afraid her sister's family might not have enough food, so he immediately sent them rice. After Xianying remarried, the old man invited her to visit her "mother's" home several times and often reminded her: the other side is also a poor peasant, and you should help him study Chairman Mao's works well.

The Fundamental Reason is That He Read Chairman Mao's Books

Elderly poor peasant Li Fari established a completely new type of relationship with the driver who caused the accident and the daughter-in-law who remarried. This is something that all bourgeoisie and those with bourgeois ideas in their heads cannot understand, and it is a complete break with bourgeois morality and feudal morality.

The reason Li Fari's spiritual world has undergone such profound changes is fundamentally because he read Chairman Mao's books and received the education of Mao Zedong Thought. Although he is illiterate, he often asks his children to read Chairman Mao's works to him. He has repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other articles. He loves Chairman Mao and the Party infinitely, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and listens to the Party's words. The brilliant thoughts and actions he showed in the face of this unfortunate incident prove that he is a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

### 俺永远听毛主席的话——记老贫农李法瑞正确处理儿子不幸死亡的感人事件

    俺永远听毛主席的话
    ——记老贫农李法瑞正确处理儿子不幸死亡的感人事件
    这篇通讯十分动人。老贫农李法瑞的儿子不幸被汽车压死以后，他完全以党和国家的利益为重，以人民的利益为重，怀着深厚的阶级感情，正确地处理了这次不幸事件，受到了广大群众的称赞。李法瑞所以有这种高尚的精神境界，根本的原因是他能活学活用毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。他的动人事迹，闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉。
    山东临沂县大太平公社东张屯大队老贫农李法瑞，活学活用毛主席著作，精神世界发生了巨大而深刻的变化。他正确对待儿子被汽车压死的事，是说明这种变化的一个极其生动的例证。
    感人肺腑的阶级情谊
    李法瑞今年五十六岁。他的第二个儿子李志爱，在去临沂城的公路上，不幸被汽车压死。事情发生之后，临沂汽车运输公司的主要负责同志都亲临现场并与东张屯大队的干部商处如何安慰、抚恤死者亲属以及如何埋葬死者的问题。汽车运输公司方面觉得对不起死者，大队干部也觉得没法向李大爷报告这件不幸事故。李法瑞到现场后，过路人议论纷纭：有的责怪司机，有的责怪死者，也有个别人乘机煽动。但是，李大爷环视现场之后，镇定地说：“这件事不能全怪司机，是我的孩子骑车躲错了方向；孩子今年只有二十六岁，还年轻，已经死了，不能再去怪他。都怪我当爹的平日教育不够。”“在旧社会，国民党汽车压死人不如压死一条狗。新社会，压死一个普通农民，领导就这样关心，亲自来处理，还来安慰我，我虽然难过，但是我更感动。我只要求领导不要为难，赶快埋葬，停在这里影响不好。”李大爷发自内心的阶级情谊，平息了现场的议论。
    立场坚定，风吹不动
    有阶级，就有阶级斗争。东张屯绝大部分人都能正确对待这一事件，但极少数反动阶级分子，却千方百计进行破坏。有的钻到李大爷家里，指着被压坏的自行车说：“你得去要车子！”“你得去要儿啊！”“你不能这样算完！”但是，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话的李大爷，立场坚定，风吹不动。他向党支部表示绝不会上坏人的当。他说：“俺只听毛主席的话，只听党的话。毛主席说，无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？俺是受苦人，三辈子都逃过荒。俺七岁卖豆腐，连筐都赔上还挣不出吃的。现在，俺四个儿子，一个女儿，解放后都念过书。没有共产党，别说念书，连命也难保活到今天。没有党，没有国家，没有公司的汽车，送不来沂河水，运不来化肥，咱们能吃上大米？能穿上细布？能挂上蚊帐？儿子死了，俺是难过的，可是俺想起这些，心就稳住了，绝不会上坏人的当。”
    “俺只依靠共产党，绝不靠抚恤过生活”
    事情发生后，汽车运输公司几次派人来看望老人。大队党支部和周围群众，更是十分关怀。汽车公司还给老人送来抚恤金。李大爷是怎样对待抚恤呢？他说：“俺感谢党的心意，俺死了儿子，已经叫领导操了心，俺只接受党的心意，绝不能再花国家的钱。”当同志们一再劝他收下抚恤金时，他说：“钱是小事，革命是大事。只要有伟大的党，有伟大的领袖毛主席，有伟大的国家，有伟大的社会主义，俺贫下中农就什么都有了。有了党，别说没困难，就是有了困难，党还能不管俺？俺只依靠共产党，绝不依靠抚恤过生活。”抚恤金往返送了四次，李大爷还是不肯接受。他万分激动地说：“党的心意俺收下了。可是这钱，请支援灾区人民。这是俺的心意，请党一定收下！”
    你要永远听毛主席的话
    汽车运输公司负责人曾向李大爷表示：事故发生之后，要向全体司机和工作人员进行教育，使大家接受教训，并要按规定给肇事司机以应得的处分。当李大爷了解到肇事司机明新祥是贫下中农出身，曾参加过抗美援朝战争，他不安起来。他决定到运输公司去一趟。公司的书记、经理热情地接待了他。大爷要先见司机，见面后就问：“那天车是你开的？”司机答：“是”。李大爷发现司机又难过又紧张，便说：“孩子，不要怕，咱们公司是党领导的，你和俺也是党领导的，又都是贫下中农，是一家人。志爱年轻，刚结婚。俺是在逃荒路上把他背大的。他死了，俺不能不动心，不能不难过。要在旧社会，别说你压死了俺的儿子，就是压死了你亲兄弟，你亲爹也不能轻饶了你。就是你爹饶你，人家媳妇也不能饶你。可现在是新社会，咱们是真正的一家人，就不能用老法子来办这件事。只要大家都能好好接受教训，好好干革命，不再出事故，这就好了。再说，志爱死了，你就是我的儿子。”这席话，使司机和在场所有同志极为感动。司机马上检讨自己，说当天天还没明，以为路上行人少，把车子开得太快，以致急刹车没有刹住。他表示愿意接受组织上任何处分，记住这一教训，记住李大爷的教导。李大爷最后讲：“俺只一句话：你要好好学雷锋，学王杰，永远听党的话，永远听毛主席的话！”
    临沂汽车公司根据当时肇事情况和李大爷再三请求，减轻了对肇事司机明新祥的处分。李大爷对待这一事件的崇高思想，明新祥看在眼里，记在心里，要把李大爷当作父亲。他省吃俭用，给李大爷寄了十五元，亲切地称李大爷老两口为父母亲。东张屯大队党支部收到后，担心李大爷不接受。但李大爷却说：“既是儿子寄来的，当爹的那有不收的道理！”又说：“他也拖儿带女，粮食可能不宽裕，我要给他捎大米去。当爹的给儿子捎大米，儿子也绝不会不收。可是，要告诉他，今后不要再捎钱来，要好好工作，能像焦裕禄那样一心为革命，一心为人民，那比捎给我一百元、一千元也强一万倍。”“要好好帮助他学习毛主席著作”
    又过了一个时期，他儿媳妇献英的娘家姐姐，给献英介绍了一个对象。献英请示党支部应该怎样对待这件事。她说自己的心情很矛盾，公婆对她都很好，实在舍不得离开。党支部认为她还很年轻，应该改嫁，只是怕李大爷伤心。于是便请妇代会主任陪她一起去谈谈。一去，老人就明白了。他对献英说：“你年轻，又没孩子，是得走。走后，你虽不是我的儿媳妇，可还能做我的闺女，你要什么我陪送什么。”他随即把明新祥捎来的十五元钱给了献英。献英感动得流了眼泪，表示什么也不要，钱和东西都留给弟妹。献英被她姐姐接去后，老人怕她姐家口粮不富裕，马上送去了大米。献英改嫁以后，老人几次请她过“娘”家，并常嘱咐她：对方也是贫下中农，你要好好帮助他学习毛主席著作。
    根本的根本是他读了毛主席的书
    老贫农李法瑞与肇事司机、另婚的儿媳，建立了一种完全新型的关系。这是一切资产阶级和满脑子资产阶级思想的人所不能理解的，是同资产阶级道德和封建道德彻底决裂的表现。
    李法瑞的精神世界所以会有这样深刻的变化，根本的根本是他读了毛主席的书，接受了毛泽东思想的教育。他虽然不识字，但是他经常要他的儿女们读毛主席著作给他听。他反复学习过《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》等文章。他无限地热爱毛主席，热爱党，听毛主席的话，听党的话。他在不幸事件面前所表现的光辉思想和行动，证实了他是活学活用毛主席著作的模范。
