The revolutionary spirit of the workers at Wuhan Steel Company is soaring, driving production to new heights. Their main products, such as steel, iron, steel billets, coke, fertilizer, crude benzene, and refractory bricks, have not only seen significant increases in output but also substantial improvements in variety and quality.

Since May this year, the revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel Company have better applied Chairman Mao's works, launching fierce attacks on those in power who are taking the capitalist road, against all ghosts and monsters opposing the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. They have also launched assaults on all outdated rules and regulations that hinder production development and restrict the revolutionary initiative and creativity of the workers, paving the way for a new leap in production. In June, July, and August, the hottest months in Wuhan, the steel workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, put forth the slogan of "Fighting for Victory in Both Revolution and Production" and, through arduous efforts, achieved outstanding production results. The initial rolling mill, despite having fewer workers and facing high temperatures in July, not only overfulfilled the state plan and set a new historical record since its operation but also reduced costs by over 500,000 yuan. The iron smelting plant, which usually sees a decline in production during the hot season, saw a significant increase in output this year, reaching the highest production level since its operation. The coke rate has also been significantly reduced, using 40 to 50 kilograms less coke per ton of pig iron compared to December last year. The steel smelting plant has fought brilliant battles on both the political and production fronts, overfulfilling the state plan in August and significantly improving the quality of steel.

Through their personal experiences, the revolutionary workers have come to realize that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline and the beacon of the revolution. The steel workers have an unbounded love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, and their desire to study Chairman Mao's works has become even more urgent. Many workshops, departments, and factories have extensively carried out activities such as "sharing sessions," "reading groups," and "on-site learning and application" to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. The cultural revolution committees of the company's affiliated factories, departments, and engineering companies, in order to ensure victory on both the spiritual and material fronts, have, according to the spirit of the Sixteen Points, formed two sets of leadership teams, focusing on both revolution and production. They are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to unleash the boundless enthusiasm of the revolutionary workers, and to further achieve victory in both the cultural revolution and production construction.

    武钢职工活学活用毛主席著作狠抓两个环子
    革命精神昂扬　生产节节上升
    钢、铁、焦炭、化肥等产量显著增长，品种质量大大提高
    据新华社武汉十四日电　武汉钢铁公司广大革命职工在无产阶级文化大革命中斗志昂扬，推动了生产全面跃进。他们生产的主要产品，诸如钢、铁、钢坯、焦炭、化肥、粗苯和耐火砖等等，不仅产量显著上升，而且品种质量也大大提高。
    今年五月以来，武汉钢铁公司广大革命职工更好地活学活用毛主席著作，向走资本主义道路的当权派，向一切反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火，向一切阻碍生产发展和束缚工人革命积极性、创造性的陈规旧章冲击，为新的生产跃进铺平了道路。六、七、八月三个月，正是武汉最热的季节，给高温作业的钢铁生产带来了困难。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的钢铁工人革命精神昂扬，提出了“誓夺革命生产双胜利”的口号，艰苦奋战，夺得了出色的生产成绩。初轧厂在七月份人员少、天气热的条件下，不仅超额完成国家计划，创造了投产以来历史最高纪录，还降低成本五十多万元。炼铁厂在高温季节，过去都是生产下降，今年产量却大量上升，出现了开炉以来没有达到过的最高生产水平。焦比也大幅度降低，冶炼一吨生铁，比去年十二月份少用四十到五十公斤焦炭。炼钢厂在政治思想战线和生产战线上都打了漂亮仗，八月份超额完成了国家计划，钢的质量也有很大提高。
    广大革命职工从亲身实践中体会到，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是革命的灯塔。钢铁工人对毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，学习毛主席著作的要求更迫切。许多厂、部、车间广泛开展了“讲用会”、“读书会”、现场学现场用等活学活用毛主席著作的群众性活动。公司所属厂、部、工程公司的文化革命委员会，为了保证在精神战线和物质战线上打胜仗，根据十六条精神，抓革命，促生产，组成了两套班子，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发挥广大革命职工的冲天干劲，进一步夺取文化大革命和生产建设的双胜利。（附图片）
