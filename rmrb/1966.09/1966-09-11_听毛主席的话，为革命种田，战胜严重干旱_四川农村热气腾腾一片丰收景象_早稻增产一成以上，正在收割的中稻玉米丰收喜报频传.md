The broad masses of peasants in Sichuan Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have overcome severe drought and, after four consecutive years of increased production, have once again achieved a great situation on the agricultural production front. Now, the fields are filled with a bustling scene of harvest. The peasants say: This year's drought is the worst in many years, and so is the harvest. This is a victory of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Since mid-August, the harvest of rice and corn in Sichuan Province has been successively carried out from south to north. Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, various levels of leadership have grasped the revolution and promoted production. A large number of county and commune cadres have gone deep into the countryside to strengthen leadership. The commune members, carrying Chairman Mao's quotations, have enthusiastically joined the battle. They study the quotations during rest, and when they encounter problems, they study the quotations. Everything is done according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The progress and quality of the harvest work are both better than in previous years. The early rice that has been harvested has increased by more than ten percent compared to last year.

The mid-season rice and corn that are currently being harvested are also reporting bumper harvests. Jiangjin District has already harvested more than 30 million mu of rice, generally increasing by about twenty percent compared to last year, and 700,000 mu of corn has also increased by more than ten percent compared to last year.

"People listen to Chairman Mao's words, the land listens to people's words." This is the common summary of the broad masses of commune members on this year's good harvest. From last winter to late July this year, Sichuan Province has had more than 100 counties affected by drought, with more than 50 counties experiencing drought for more than 100 days. This has brought serious difficulties to agricultural production. However, under the leadership of party organizations at all levels in the province, the broad masses of cadres and commune members, through studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," have established the idea of fighting drought for the revolution and have bravely and tenaciously fought against the drought. The commune members proudly say: After studying Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven nor earth. We will fight against severe drought and minor drought! They insist on the policy of self-reliance and rely on collective power to build a large number of irrigation stations and dams. Many projects originally planned to take several years were completed in a few months.

The victory in the anti-drought struggle has made the broad masses of cadres and commune members love Chairman Mao and his works even more. Now, Sichuan's countryside has launched a more extensive and in-depth campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Under the impetus of this campaign, they are focusing on the current situation while preparing for next year, actively carrying out autumn sowing preparations while ensuring a good autumn harvest. Various places also plan to launch a large-scale winter agricultural land construction movement this winter.

This year, in Hebei's Zunhua County, Jianming Commune's autumn crops are growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. This is a scene of commune members spraying pesticides in the cotton fields.

    听毛主席的话，为革命种田，战胜严重干旱
    四川农村热气腾腾一片丰收景象
    早稻增产一成以上，正在收割的中稻玉米丰收喜报频传
    据新华社成都十日电　四川省广大农民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜了严重干旱，在连续四年增产后，今年农业生产战线上又出现了一个大好形势。现在，田野里是一片热气腾腾的丰收景象。社员们说：今年的干旱是多年未见过的，丰收也是多年未见过的，这是活学活用毛主席著作的胜利。
    从八月中旬起，四川省的水稻、玉米收割工作就陆续从南到北次第展开。在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，各级领导抓革命，促生产，大批县、社干部深入农村加强领导。社员们带着毛主席语录牌，情绪高昂地投入战斗。他们休息时学语录，遇到问题时学语录，一切按照毛主席的教导办事。收割工作进度之快，质量之好，都超过往年。已经收完的早稻，比去年增产一成以上。
    正收割中的中稻和玉米，也是丰收喜报频传。江津专区已经收完三百多万亩水稻，一般比去年增产二成左右，七十万亩玉米，也比去年增产一成以上。
      “人听毛主席的话，地听人的话”。这是广大社员对今年获得好收成的共同总结。从去年冬天到今年七月上旬，四川省先后有一百多个县受旱，其中五十多县受旱一百多天。这给农业生产带来了严重的困难。但是，在全省各级党组织的领导下，广大干部社员通过学习《为人民服务》《愚公移山》和《纪念白求恩》等文章，树立了为革命抗旱种田的思想，英勇顽强地向干旱作斗争。社员们豪迈地说：学了毛泽东思想，天不怕，地不怕，大旱大抗，小旱小抗！他们坚持自力更生方针，依靠集体力量大修水利，结果新修了大批提灌站和河堰。许多原计划几年的工程，几个月便完成了。
    抗旱斗争的胜利，使广大干部社员更加热爱毛主席，热爱毛主席著作。现在，四川农村已掀起了一个更加广泛深入地活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。在这个热潮的推动下，他们一手抓当前，一手抓明年，在搞好秋收的同时，积极进行秋种准备。各地还计划在今冬开展大规模的冬季农田基本建设运动。（附图片）
