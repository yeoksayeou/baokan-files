The sixth session of the first meeting of the People's Assembly of Albania opened solemnly in the People's Assembly Hall here on the afternoon of September 9.

Enver Hoxha, Hysni Kapo, Mehmet Shehu, and other leaders of the Party and state of Albania, as well as 240 deputies, attended the meeting. When Hoxha and his comrades entered the venue, all the representatives stood up and applauded warmly.

Ambassadors from various countries to Albania were also invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by the oldest deputy of the People's Assembly, Spiro Moisiu. In his opening speech, he said that the unanimous support shown by the voters in the July 10 elections was a vivid manifestation of the ironclad unity of the Albanian people under the leadership of the Party of Labour of Albania headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Moisiu pointed out that since the end of last year, the Party of Labour of Albania and the government, relying on the working masses, have taken a series of revolutionary measures to continuously revolutionize people's thinking. He said that many revolutionary decisions made by the Party and government of Albania are important historical events in the victory of socialism in Albania and the contribution of Marxism-Leninism to the world socialist revolutionary cause.

Moisiu said that in order to complete the Fourth Five-Year Plan and fulfill our domestic and internationalist duties, we will continue to strengthen the unity of the people around the Party, the Party Central Committee, and Comrade Enver Hoxha, strengthen our friendship with our friends and great, sincere ally—the People's Republic of China, and strengthen our friendship with the peoples of all countries, revolutionary countries, and forces around the world.

Moisiu finally expressed that the Albanian people fully support the sacred and heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices.

The meeting elected the Credentials Committee.

The meeting will continue on the morning of September 10.
