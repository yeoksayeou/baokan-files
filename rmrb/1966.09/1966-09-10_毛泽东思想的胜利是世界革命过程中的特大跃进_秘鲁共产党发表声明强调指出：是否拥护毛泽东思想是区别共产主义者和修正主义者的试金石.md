The Communist Party of Peru has issued a statement emphasizing that support for Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone for distinguishing communists from revisionists.

	New China News Agency, September 9th: Lima - The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Peru issued a statement titled "The Communist Party of Peru Warmly Welcomes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the Victory of Mao Zedong Thought" on August 8th. The statement emphasizes, "The touchstone for distinguishing communists from revisionists is whether one supports Mao Zedong Thought. Those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought are opposing Marxism-Leninism and opposing the revolution."

	The statement was signed by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Peru, Saturnino Paredes, and was published in the party's official newspaper, "Red Flag." The full text of the statement is as follows:

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution launched in China has shaken the world. The distinctive feature of this revolution is that the glorious Communist Party of China and the entire working people, including workers, peasants, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, have all participated in it. The Communist Party of Peru expresses its revolutionary joy and heartfelt support for this remarkable historical event, which is a great leap forward in the world revolutionary process. The experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China have enriched Marxism-Leninism and contributed to the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations to break the shackles of American imperialism and its lackeys. These experiences have also contributed to the struggle of all communist parties for the purity of Marxism-Leninism, for socialism, and for communism.

	At its Fifth National Congress held in November 1965, the Communist Party of Peru pointed out that Mao Zedong has developed Marxism-Leninism, becoming the undisputed leader of the world revolution, and suggested studying his works. The Communist Party of Peru regards Mao Zedong Thought as a component of Marxism-Leninism and uses it as a weapon in its work and revolutionary struggle. Mao Zedong Thought scientifically and correctly summarizes and concentrates the international historical experience of the proletarian revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is contemporary Marxism, the highest development of Marxism-Leninism on fundamental issues such as new democratic revolution and proletarian dictatorship, class struggle under general conditions and under the conditions of building socialism, the national question and national liberation wars, international issues and the fundamental contradictions of the contemporary world, the question of war and peace, the construction of the party and the struggle against revisionism and dogmatism, and the theory of knowledge and revolutionary practice. In short, Mao Zedong Thought has enriched Marxism-Leninism in the realms of thought, politics, and military affairs, placing the people and the role of the individual in the correct position, exposing the true nature of the main enemy of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world, showing it to be a paper tiger that can be defeated. At the same time, Mao Zedong, with his military thought summarized in the concept of people's war, has provided an invincible weapon for revolutionary struggle. His military thought reflects his military strategic genius.

	Mao Zedong Thought teaches us to carry the revolution through to the end not only in the economic, political, and military spheres, but also in the cultural sphere. It correctly points out the ways and means of foreseeing and preventing the restoration of capitalism in socialist countries, and also correctly points out the ways and means of foreseeing, preventing, and smashing the infiltration of revisionist and bourgeois ideas into the ranks of the communist parties.

	When the Communist Party of Peru speaks of applying Marxism-Leninism to the specific conditions of the Peruvian revolution, it includes Mao Zedong Thought within Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, in its quest for truth to create its own revolutionary theory and in its party-building work, it regards Mao Zedong Thought as its weapon, as a weapon in the struggle against American imperialism, the comprador bourgeoisie, and the large landowners, and as a weapon in the struggle against modern revisionism and its revisionists in the country.

	In the contemporary world, those who do not resolutely support Mao Zedong Thought and apply it to their daily work and struggle cannot be considered true Marxists-Leninists. The touchstone for distinguishing communists from revisionists is whether one supports Mao Zedong Thought. Those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought are opposing Marxism-Leninism and opposing the revolution.

	In the historical task of creating Peruvian revolutionary theory, in the work of applying Marxism-Leninism to the specific conditions of our country, Mao Zedong Thought is a reliable weapon for seeking truth and achieving victory.

	Mao Zedong Thought is profound yet easy to understand, clear and forceful, and suitable for workers, peasants, and all working people to understand and apply. This can be seen from the victorious Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. In the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong Thought has triumphed over bourgeois ideology and ideology that, disguised under the mask of Marxism-Leninism, has occupied certain positions advantageous to itself and attempted to subvert the powerful socialist state of China and corrupt the ranks of the Communist Party of China. The victory of Mao Zedong Thought is the victory of Marxism-Leninism developed to its highest stage, the victory of the masses of the people, and a giant leap forward in the world revolutionary process.

    毛泽东思想的胜利是世界革命过程中的特大跃进
    秘鲁共产党发表声明强调指出：是否拥护毛泽东思想是区别共产主义者和修正主义者的试金石
    新华社九日讯　利马消息：秘鲁共产党中央委员会政治委员会八月发表了题为《秘鲁共产党热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东思想的胜利》的声明。声明强调指出，“区别共产主义者和修正主义者的试金石，就是看他是否拥护毛泽东思想。谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是反对马克思列宁主义，就是反对革命。”
    这个声明由秘共总书记萨图尼诺·帕雷德斯签署，刊登在秘共机关报《红旗报》上。声明全文如下：
    中国胜利开展的无产阶级文化大革命震动了全世界，这一革命的特点是，光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志领导下的全体劳动人民，工人、农民和人民解放军战士都参加了这一革命。秘鲁共产党对作为世界革命进程中一个大跃进的这一令人注目的历史事件，表示革命的欢庆之情和衷心的支持。中国无产阶级文化大革命的经验丰富了马克思列宁主义，为世界所有被压迫人民和被压迫民族粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的枷锁的斗争做出了贡献。这些经验对于所有共产党为马克思列宁主义的纯洁性、为社会主义和共产主义而进行的斗争也做出了贡献。
    秘鲁共产党在它一九六五年十一月举行的第五次全国代表会议上指出，毛泽东发展了马克思列宁主义，成为世界革命的不容争辩的领袖，并且建议学习他的著作。秘鲁共产党认为，毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义思想的组成部分，并把它作为自己工作的武器和革命斗争的武器。毛泽东思想科学地正确地总结和集中了无产阶级革命的国际历史经验。毛泽东思想是当代的马克思主义，是马克思列宁主义在以下各个根本问题上的最高发展，这些问题是：关于新民主主义革命和无产阶级专政，关于一般情况下的阶级斗争和建设社会主义条件下的阶级斗争，关于民族问题和民族解放战争，关于国际问题和当代世界的基本矛盾，关于战争与和平问题，关于党的建设和反对修正主义和教条主义的斗争，关于认识和革命实践的理论。总之，毛泽东思想在思想、政治和军事方面都丰富了马克思列宁主义，把人民群众和人的作用放到了正确的位置，揭露了世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的主要敌人的真正本质，指出它是一只纸老虎，并使人们懂得它是能够被打败的。同时，毛泽东以概括在他的军事思想中的人民战争的观点，提供了一个战无不胜的革命斗争武器。他的军事思想反映了他的军事战略天才。
    毛泽东思想教导我们不仅在经济、政治和军事方面，而且在文化方面都要把革命进行到底，它正确地指出了预见和防止在社会主义国家的资本主义复辟的方式方法，也正确地指出了预见、防止和粉碎修正主义和资产阶级思想渗入共产党队伍中的方式方法。
    秘鲁共产党在提到把马克思列宁主义运用于秘鲁革命的具体条件的时候，是把毛泽东思想包括在马克思列宁主义之内的。因此，它在探求真理以创造自己的革命理论时和在建设党的工作中，把毛泽东思想当作它的工作的武器，当作反对美帝国主义、大买办资产阶级和大庄园主的斗争武器、当作反对现代修正主义及其在本国的修正主义的斗争武器。
    在当代，凡是不坚决拥护毛泽东思想并把它运用于日常工作和斗争的，就不能算是真正的马克思列宁主义者。区别共产主义者和修正主义者的试金石，就是看他是否拥护毛泽东思想。谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是反对马克思列宁主义，就是反对革命。
    在创造秘鲁革命理论的这一历史任务中，在把马克思列宁主义运用于我国现实的具体条件的工作中，毛泽东思想是寻找真理和获取胜利的可靠武器。
    毛泽东思想深入浅出，鲜明有力，便于工人、农民和所有劳动人民理解和运用，从中国进行的胜利的无产阶级文化大革命中我们就可以对它做出这种评价。在文化大革命中，毛泽东思想战胜了用马克思列宁主义假面具伪装起来的、盘踞了某些有利于自己利益的阵地、企图颠覆中国强大的社会主义国家和腐蚀中国共产党的队伍的资产阶级思想和意识形态。毛泽东思想的胜利，就是发展到最高阶段的马克思列宁主义的胜利，就是人民群众的胜利，就是世界革命过程中的一个特大跃进。
