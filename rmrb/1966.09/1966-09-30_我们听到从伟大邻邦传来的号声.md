On our heroic land, in the place that the people of the world are always concerned about, I and my comrades around me, whether at work or hidden in the trenches, whenever the Beijing Radio starts broadcasting, no one needs to be notified, everyone gathers quietly to listen, feeling an endless warmth in our hearts. When we hear the voice of the Chinese people angrily warning the American imperialists coming from the radio, we are so moved.

The Beijing Radio brings the voice of the great Chinese people. It is like a wind blowing in from the East China Sea, carrying a magical power that blows to us, to the soldiers on the front lines of the anti-American struggle, making us feel refreshed, happy, and optimistic. It continuously deals fatal blows to the enemy.

One day, we received the news: Chairman Mao and the leaders of the Chinese Party and state attended a mass rally of tens of thousands of people in Beijing, angrily warning the American imperialists who have committed heinous crimes in our country. We were so moved that even the capillaries in our bodies trembled. The hatred of the Chinese Party, government, and people towards the enemy and their powerful warnings have inspired us, strengthening the confidence of our soldiers in victory.

On our long journey, there are still many difficulties. But we are familiar with the Long March; what long journey can we not overcome! When our ranks have millions of people shouting like surging waves, we hear the clear call from the great land of China: "Surround them!" "Surround them!" Not letting a single imperialist escape, we will pursue them relentlessly! Only after all the demons and monsters have entered their graves will we put away our bayonets.

    我们听到从伟大邻邦传来的号声
    〔越南南方〕文森
    在我们英雄的国土上，在全世界人民每时每刻都关切的地方，我和周围的同志一样，无论是在工作中或隐蔽在工事里，每当北京电台开始播音时，谁也不用通知，大家都安静地围在一起收听着，心里感到无限的温暖。当我们听到中国人民愤怒地警告美帝国主义的声音不断地从广播中传来的时候，我们是多么激动。
    北京电台传来了伟大的中国人民的声音，它像一阵从东海吹进来的风，带着一股神奇的力量吹到我们这里，吹到抗美斗争最前线的战士身上，使我们感到心情舒畅、愉快和开朗。它不断地给予敌人以致命的打击。
    我们有一天听到消息：毛主席和中国党和国家领导人在天安门上出席了北京市数十万人的群众大会，愤怒警告在我国犯下滔天罪行的美帝国主义，我们激动得连身上的微血管都颤动起来。中国党、政府和中国人民对敌人的愤恨和强有力的警告已鼓舞着我们，坚定了我们解放军战士们必胜的信心。
    在我们漫长的道路上还有许许多多的困难。但我们已熟悉了长征，有什么漫长的道路不能越过！当我们的队伍里有千百万人发出如海涛澎湃的冲击的声音时，我们听到从伟大的中国国土上传来响亮的号声：“合围！”“合围！”不让一个帝国主义者跑掉，要跟踪追击！只有当所有的牛鬼蛇神进入坟墓以后，我们才把刺刀收起来。
