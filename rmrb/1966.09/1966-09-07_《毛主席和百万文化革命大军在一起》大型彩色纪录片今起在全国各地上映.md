The epic color documentary "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army Together" begins screening nationwide starting today.

New China News Agency, September 6th: The epic color documentary "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army Together" has been completed by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and will begin screening in the capital and various locations starting September 7th.

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, on August 18th, stood on the majestic Tiananmen Square with the revolutionary masses from the capital and from all over the country, celebrating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This historic moment is vividly recreated in the film, which will once again inspire the revolutionary masses with great enthusiasm.

The film, set to the melody of "The East Is Red," presents a series of moving scenes:

A red sun rises from the eastern horizon, and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao walks across the Golden Water Bridge in front of Tiananmen, straight into the midst of the masses who have longed for him day and night. Chairman Mao, dressed in a green military uniform, radiates health and vitality, shaking hands warmly with many people around him and waving to the revolutionary masses. The surging square is a sea of red flags, with a million people leaping and cheering, repeatedly raising the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echo through the sky.

Chairman Mao, along with Comrades Lin Biao and Zhou Enlai, receive representatives of the Red Guards and students from the capital and from all over the country on the Tiananmen Gate Tower and pose for a group photo with them. The young revolutionary successors happily gather around Chairman Mao, singing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" under the direction of Comrade Zhou Enlai.

Comrades Lin Biao and Zhou Enlai deliver speeches at the rally, and the million revolutionary masses repeatedly cheer, "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" These moving scenes are all captured on film.

The film also records the scene of the million-strong Cultural Revolution Army, composed of revolutionary masses from the capital and from all over the country, marching through Tiananmen Square in an endless stream, receiving the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao. This fully demonstrates the boundless love of the Red Guards and revolutionary masses from the capital and from all over the country for Chairman Mao, their unwavering faith and adoration for the great Mao Zedong Thought, and their resolute determination to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.
