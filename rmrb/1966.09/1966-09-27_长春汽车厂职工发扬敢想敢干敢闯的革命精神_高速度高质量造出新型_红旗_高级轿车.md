Workers of Changchun Automobile Factory Carry Forward the Revolutionary Spirit of Daring to Think, Dare to Do, and Dare to Break Through
High-Speed, High-Quality Production of New "Red Flag" Luxury Sedan

This three-row luxury sedan adopts many new structures and technologies, significantly improving upon the original "Red Flag" sedan. A batch of new products has been delivered to Beijing in time for National Day.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, September 25th: Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the workers of Changchun Automobile Factory have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to do, dare to break through, and dare to innovate. They have produced the second batch of new "Red Flag" three-row luxury sedans with higher speed and higher quality. This batch of luxury sedans has been delivered to Beijing in time for National Day.

The new "Red Flag" three-row luxury sedan adopts new structures and technologies such as hydraulic transmissions, box-shaped frames, and V-shaped engines, significantly improving upon the original "Red Flag" luxury sedan. The car has a powerful engine, high speed, stable driving, and a dignified, simple, elegant, and beautiful appearance. This new luxury sedan was delivered to the capital in time for the May Day holiday this year and has received high praise from relevant departments of the central government and drivers, who consider it a product of international advanced level.

The birth of the new "Red Flag" three-row luxury sedan is a victory of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. It is the result of the workers in the automobile industry sector of our country studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, daring to revolutionize, and bravely practicing, breaking the authority of the bourgeoisie, and breaking the foreign frameworks.

Since this car is a new type of luxury sedan, the production technology requirements are very high. The original production equipment for sedans is no longer applicable, and it is not possible to redesign and manufacture hundreds of large molds in a short time. Therefore, from the beginning, there were people who blew cold air. They advocated preparing this year and starting small-scale production next year, or preparing for one quarter this year and striving to produce the first batch of cars before October 1st. Some even proposed a "three-year plan" to start producing this car in 1967. The question is whether to follow the routine step by step slowly, or to attack the difficulties in equipment and technology at high speed and produce high-quality cars. This is a major problem facing the factory.

These two different opinions not only involve the length of time and the speed of work, but in essence, they reflect people's understanding of whether the development of production mainly relies on material and technological conditions or mainly on the enthusiasm of people. It is a question of whether to revolutionize or dare to fight. The broad revolutionary workers re-studied "On Contradiction" and "Practice," armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, correctly understood the relationship between people and things, and established the idea that people are the primary factor. Then, they repeatedly studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and discussed the situation and the political significance of manufacturing the new "Red Flag" three-row luxury sedan in opposing imperialism and revisionism. This greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. They said: "The people of Daqing can, with their revolutionary spirit of striving for strength, shake off the hat of backwardness in China's petroleum industry. We can also produce the new 'Red Flag' three-row luxury sedan as soon as possible, crush the arrogance of imperialism and revisionism, and boost the morale of the Chinese working class!"

Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the broad masses of workers, they become fearless and full of energy, accomplishing many things that were previously impossible and promoting the rapid development of production. For the production of this new luxury sedan, the body alone requires more than 1,500 blueprints. Such a large amount of work would have taken 14 experienced designers a year and a half in the past. This time, the young designers who participated in the design went deep into the field, learned from the masses of workers, labored while learning from the workers. The mass design activity ensured the completion of the design blueprints in a short time.

More than 80 brother factories across the country have prioritized the production of "Red Flag" luxury sedan parts. Therefore, more than 800 kinds of parts were supplied to Changchun Automobile Factory both quickly and well, playing an important role in the short-term production of luxury sedans.

    长春汽车厂职工发扬敢想敢干敢闯的革命精神
    高速度高质量造出新型“红旗”高级轿车
    这种三排座高级轿车采用了许多新结构、新技术，比原来的“红旗”轿车有很大改进，一批新产品已在国庆前夕运来北京
    据新华社长春二十五日电　长春汽车厂职工在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下，发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢创的革命精神，以更高的速度更高的质量制造出第二批新型“红旗”三排座高级轿车。新产的这批高级轿车，已在国庆前夕运往北京。
    新型“红旗”三排座高级轿车，采用了液压变速器、框形车架和V形发动机等许多新结构、新技术，比原来的“红旗”高级轿车有很大改进。轿车马力大、速度快、行驶平稳，车型庄重、朴实、大方、美观。这种新型高级轿车今年“五一”节前夕，已有一批运往首都，受到了中央有关部门和司机的好评，认为是具有国际先进水平的产品。
    新型“红旗”三排座高级轿车的诞生，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是我国汽车工业部门职工活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，敢于革命，勇于实践，大破资产阶级“权威”，大破洋框框的结果。
    由于这种车是一种新型的高级轿车，生产技术要求很高，原有生产轿车用的工艺装备，都已经不适用了，而重新设计制造成百套大型模具又来不及。因此，一开始就有人吹冷风。他们主张今年作好准备，明年投入小批生产，或是今年一季度作准备，力争“十·一”前出第一批车。有人甚至提出“三年规划”，到一九六七年才开始生产这种轿车。究竟是按照常规一步步慢慢来；还是高速度地攻克设备和技术上的难题，生产出高质量的轿车；这是工厂面临的一个重大问题。
    这两种不同的意见，不仅是时间长短、速度快慢的问题，实际上是反映了人们对发展生产主要是靠物质技术条件，还是主要靠发挥人的积极因素的认识问题，是要不要革命，敢不敢斗争的问题。广大革命职工重新学习了《矛盾论》和《实践论》，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，正确认识人和物的关系，树立起人的因素第一的思想。接着，他们又反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》，大讲形势和制造新型“红旗”三排座高级轿车对反帝反修的政治意义，从而激发了广大职工的革命干劲。他们说：“大庆人能以奋发图强的革命精神，甩掉了我国石油工业落后的帽子，我们也一定能够尽快地生产出新型“红旗”三排座高级轿车，灭帝国主义、修正主义的威风，长中国工人阶级的志气！”
    毛泽东思想一旦为广大职工所掌握，职工们就浑身是胆，浑身是劲，做出了许多过去做不到的事，推动了生产的迅速发展。生产这种新型高级轿车，仅车身部分，就需要一千五百多张图纸，这样大的工作量过去得十四个有经验的设计师设计一年半，而这次参加设计的青年设计人员，深入现场，拜工人群众为师，一边劳动，一边向工人群众学习。群众性的设计活动，保证了在很短时间内完成了设计图纸的任务。
    全国八十多个兄弟工厂都把“红旗”高级轿车协作件的生产，放在首位来安排。因此，八百多种协作件，都是既快又好地供应了长春汽车厂，对高级轿车能在短时间内生产出来，起了重要作用。（附图片）
