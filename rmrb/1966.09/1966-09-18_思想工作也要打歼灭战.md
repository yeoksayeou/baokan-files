I became a political instructor in 1964. At first, I knew that the main task of a political instructor is to wage the ideological battle well and to ensure that the entire company studies Chairman Mao's works thoroughly and carries forward Mao Zedong Thought. However, once I got into the situation, I was busy with administrative tasks and couldn't get away.

After arriving at the company, there were many tasks in front of me, and each one needed attention. I spent the whole day running around the training ground, checking the mess hall, and dealing with whatever came up. If the superiors emphasized a particular task, I would focus on that. This way, I couldn't devote my main energy to promoting the study of Chairman Mao's works. My efforts were scattered, and in ideological work, I often had to fight "battles of attrition."

Later, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy." This opened my mind. I thought: in the past, we fought battles by concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy, bit by bit, we defeated the eight million reactionary troops of the Kuomintang. Now, when doing work, we should also apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, focus on the key links in the work, and handle them thoroughly. From then on, I also learned the method of "concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles," and I focused on ensuring that cadres and soldiers actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Based on the actual ideological situation in the troops, I studied one viewpoint at a time and solved one problem at a time. As a result, the political and ideological awareness of the company improved rapidly.

How to concentrate forces to promote the study of Chairman Mao's works? First, we must resolutely break away from administrative matters, stand firmly on the position of political work, and devote our main energy to promoting the study of Chairman Mao's works. We must ensure that in every thought, every handling of a problem, and every meeting, we use Chairman Mao's thoughts as the guiding principle. At the same time, we mobilized every party member in the branch to devote their main energy to promoting the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Additionally, we mobilized all the organizations in the company to unite under the banner of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, serving the cause of eliminating bourgeois ideology and promoting proletarian ideology.

How to use Mao Zedong Thought to solve the ideological problems in the troops? Similarly, we cannot try to handle everything. In the rich life of the troops, soldiers reflect many active thoughts. With so many problems, which are the main ones? What is the ideological essence? We conducted specific analyses to find the most important problems. Based on the characteristics of the problems, we concentrated on studying the relevant teachings of Chairman Mao. The various organizations in the company also coordinated with the study center to carry out various auxiliary activities. Everyone's awareness was raised, and many problems were not difficult to solve.

Through this work, I deeply felt that promoting the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works is the key to doing ideological work well. If we focus on this, we can ensure that we wage a battle of annihilation in political and ideological work, and we can make our soldiers march forward on the revolutionary road, always advancing.

    思想工作也要打歼灭战
    解放军某部指导员　文中义
    我是一九六四年当指导员的。开初，自己也知道指导员的工作主要就是打好思想仗，把全连毛主席著作的学习抓好，接好毛泽东思想的班。但是一进入“情况”，我就又忙于事务，脱不开身。
    到连队以后，摆在面前的工作很多，哪项不抓也不行。整天在操场上转转，伙房里看看，遇到什么就抓什么，上级对哪项工作抓得紧，我就抓哪项。这样，就不能把主要精力用在抓毛主席著作的学习上。这样，分散了兵力，在思想工作上，就不能不常常打“击溃战”。
    以后，我学习了毛主席关于“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的教导，打开了心窍。我想：过去打仗，用“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的方法，一口一口地吃掉敌人，一部分一部分地消灭了国民党八百万反动军队；如今搞工作，也应当运用毛主席这一思想，抓住工作中的主要环节，把它彻底办好。从那以后，我也学习“集中兵力打歼灭战”的方法，狠抓干部战士活学活用毛主席著作，针对部队的思想实际，一个观点、一个观点地学习，一个问题、一个问题地解决，结果，连队的政治思想觉悟提高得很快。
    怎样集中力量抓毛主席著作的学习？首先，就是狠下决心跳出事务圈子，站定政治工作的位置，把主要精力放在抓毛主席著作学习上。做到：每想一件事，每处理一个问题，每开一次会，都用毛主席的思想挂帅。同时还发动支部的每一个党员，都把主要精力用在抓活学活用毛主席著作上。另外，还把连队的各种组织都动员起来，统到活学活用毛主席著作这条线上来，为灭资兴无服务。
    如何运用毛泽东思想来解决部队的思想问题？同样也不能什么都抓。在丰富的部队生活中，战士们反映出很多的活思想。这么多问题，到底哪是主要的呢？思想实质又是什么呢？我们都进行具体的分析，找出最主要的问题。根据问题的特点，比较集中地对毛主席的有关教导进行学习，连里各种组织又配合学习中心，开展各种辅助活动。大家提高了觉悟，很多问题就不难解决了。
    通过这段工作，使我深深体会到，抓好毛主席著作的活学活用是作好思想工作的根本，抓好了它，就能保证我们在政治思想工作上打个歼灭战，就能使我们的战士在革命的大路上阔步前进，永远向前。
