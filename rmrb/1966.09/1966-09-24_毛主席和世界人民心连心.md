Mao Zedong Thought is the magic weapon for all oppressed peoples around the world to rise up and seek liberation. It is the lifeline of revolutionary people.

Chairman Mao's words are all truths, and they resonate deeply with us poor and lower-middle peasants. One of his words is worth a thousand of ours.

In our Dongsheng Brigade, over the past seventeen years since liberation, we have carried out land reform and completed collectivization. However, the overthrown landlords and rich peasants are still struggling desperately. Through their agents—the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party—they spread evil winds and sabotage collective production. They hate Mao Zedong Thought and fear that we will grasp it.

But the mighty power of Mao Zedong Thought is unstoppable. Once the socialist education movement began, we poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's works and, following his instructions, waged class struggle. We overthrew the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and seized the reins of power. Everyone listens to Chairman Mao's words, fearing neither hardship nor toil, working from dawn to dusk, and devoting themselves wholeheartedly to the collective. This summer, grain production increased significantly, and a bumper harvest for autumn is assured.

Mao Zedong Thought not only has immense power in our village and throughout China, but it also has the same power worldwide.

Chairman Mao's heart beats in unison with the hearts of the world's people. Revolutionary people in various countries love to read Chairman Mao's books. They resolutely rise up in revolution, regarding armed struggle as the only correct path to independence and liberation. Currently, in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, revolutionary people in more than twenty countries have taken up arms to fight against imperialism and the reactionaries in their own countries. The Vietnamese people have driven 300,000 American aggressors to retreat, proving that U.S. imperialism, the number one imperialist, is a paper tiger. The world revolution will definitely advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and no one can stop it.

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries in various countries are just like the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and monsters in our village. They tremble at the mention of Chairman Mao's words and are terrified. They desperately try to block the spread of Mao Zedong Thought worldwide. However, the revolutionary people in various countries regard Mao Zedong Thought as air, sunlight, and food, which they cannot do without. The reactionaries cannot prevent the people of various countries from studying Chairman Mao's works; this is absolutely impossible.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee states: "Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the worldwide victory of socialism." The more the people of various countries grasp Mao Zedong Thought, the sooner the day of imperialism's death will come, and the more assured the victory of the world revolution will be.

    毛主席和世界人民心连心
    毛泽东思想是全世界被压迫人民闹翻身求解放的法宝，是革命人民的命根子。
    毛主席的话句句是真理，句句说在我们贫下中农心坎上，一句顶一万句。
    我们东升大队，解放十七年来，闹了土地改革，完成了集体化。但是，被推翻了的地主富农，还在疯狂挣扎，通过他们的代理人——党内走资本主义道路的当权派，刮妖风，破坏集体生产。他们仇视毛泽东思想，害怕我们掌握毛泽东思想。
    但是毛泽东思想的强大威力，是谁也阻挡不了的。社会主义教育运动一开展，我们贫下中农大学毛主席著作，按照毛主席的指示，大搞阶级斗争，斗倒了党内走资本主义道路的当权派，夺回了印把子。大家听毛主席的话，不怕苦、不怕累，起早摸黑搞生产，一心一意为集体。今年夏粮大增产，大秋丰收也已成定局。
    毛泽东思想不仅在我们村、在全中国有无比强大的威力，在全世界也是这样。
    毛主席和世界人民心连心。各国革命人民都爱读毛主席的书。他们坚决起来革命，把武装斗争看作自己争独立、求解放的唯一正确道路。目前，亚、非、拉三大洲，有二十多个国家的革命人民，拿起了枪杆子，同帝国主义和各国反动派斗争。越南人民把三十万美国鬼子兵，打得滚的滚，爬的爬，证明美国这个头号帝国主义是地地道道的纸老虎。世界革命一定照着毛主席所指引的方向前进，谁也拦不住。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派同我们村的地富反坏、牛鬼蛇神一样，听到毛主席的话就打哆嗦，害怕得要命。他们拚命阻拦毛泽东思想在全世界传播。但是，各国革命人民把毛泽东思想看作空气、阳光和粮食，不能缺少。反动派不让各国人民学习毛主席著作，万万办不到。
    党的八届十一中全会公报说：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。”各国人民掌握毛泽东思想的越多，帝国主义死亡的日子就越快，世界革命的胜利就越有保障。
