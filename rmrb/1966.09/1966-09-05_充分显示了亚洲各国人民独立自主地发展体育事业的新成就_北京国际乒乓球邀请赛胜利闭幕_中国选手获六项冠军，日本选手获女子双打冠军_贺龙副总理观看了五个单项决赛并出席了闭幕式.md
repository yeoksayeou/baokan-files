The 1966 Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational, which symbolizes the unity and friendship among the peoples of Asian countries and their shared spirit of anti-imperialism, concluded tonight with five single-item finals. Amidst the enthusiastic applause and cheers of over 15,000 spectators and athletes from various countries, the event came to a successful close. Chinese table tennis players, flying the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, won six out of the seven events in this invitational tournament.

Vice Premier He Long attended tonight's five single-item finals and the closing ceremony.

The competition hall at the Beijing Workers' Gymnasium was filled with a strong revolutionary atmosphere tonight. Over 15,000 spectators, holding copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang revolutionary songs and came to watch the finals, enthusiastically celebrating the new achievements of Asian table tennis players under the banner of unity and anti-imperialism.

Tonight's five single-item finals were intense and exciting. The audience frequently applauded and cheered for the players' excellent skills. The men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles finals were all contested between Chinese players. The men's singles final between Zhuang Zedong and Li Fu'rong attracted great interest from the audience. They had competed for the championship and runner-up positions in the 26th, 27th, and 28th World Table Tennis Championships. From the start of the match, the court was filled with rapid exchanges, and the audience's applause was continuous. The result was Zhuang Zedong winning the championship once again, and Li Fu'rong taking the runner-up position.

The women's doubles final was the only match tonight between Chinese and Japanese players. This final attracted the full attention of the audience. The opposing players were: Lin Huiqing and Zheng Minzhi from China, and Yamanaka Kyoko and Fukatsu Naoko from Japan. Lin Huiqing and Zheng Minzhi, after losing the first set, once again demonstrated their steady chopping skills, winning the second set with a score of 21-9. However, Yamanaka and Fukatsu adopted a strategy of steady long shots mixed with sudden short shots in the third set, disrupting the opponent's rhythm. Although Lin Huiqing and Zheng Minzhi ran back and forth, tenaciously saving many difficult balls, due to more errors, they ultimately lost the last two sets with scores of 18-21 and 17-21.

During the more than ten days of joint training and competition in this invitational tournament, table tennis players from various countries learned from each other, exchanged experiences, and collectively improved. Not only did players from countries with higher levels like China, Japan, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea achieve excellent results in the competition, but the levels of players from countries like the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Cambodia, Ceylon, and Syria also showed significant improvement. Some players participating in the invitational tournament for the first time also demonstrated a certain level of strength. This fully displayed the new achievements of Asian emerging countries in independently developing their sports. More importantly, the players from various countries, who came here with the wish to "enhance friendship, mutually promote, collectively improve, and unite against imperialism," gathered together, got to know each other, and supported each other, contributing to promoting the fighting unity and friendship between the peoples and athletes of Asian countries.

The results of tonight's five single-item finals were as follows:
- Men's Singles: Zhuang Zedong (China) defeated Li Fu'rong (China), 3-1;
- Women's Singles: Lin Huiqing (China) defeated Li Li (China), 3-0;
- Men's Doubles: Li Fu'rong and Lu Jufang (China) defeated Zhuang Zedong and Li Jingguang (China), 3-1;
- Women's Doubles: Yamanaka Kyoko and Fukatsu Naoko (Japan) defeated Lin Huiqing and Zheng Minzhi (China), 3-1;
- Mixed Doubles: Li Jingguang and Li Heman (China) defeated Li Fu'rong and Li Li (China), 3-0.

Today, the consolation finals for men's and women's singles were also held. The results were Kiyoharu Kiyonobu from Japan and Nguyen Thi Mai from Vietnam winning the men's and women's championships, respectively.

After the five single-item finals, over 15,000 spectators, accompanied by the orchestra, sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" in unison. Following that, the award ceremony was held. The chairman of the organizing committee of this invitational tournament, Chen Xian, and vice-chairmen Zhao Xiwu and Du Haoran, first presented the excellent athlete awards to the outstanding athletes from various countries. Then, the team leaders from Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Cambodia, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam presented awards to the top three athletes in women's singles, men's singles, women's doubles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles. Finally, the team leaders from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Japan presented awards for the consolation finals in women's singles and men's singles. When the athletes from various countries walked onto the award stage to the revolutionary music "Mao Zedong's Works Shine Brilliantly" and "We Are Marching on the Great Road," the entire audience enthusiastically applauded, celebrating the new achievements of the athletes from various countries.

As the invitational tournament concluded, the entire audience sang the "East Is Red" anthem and chanted slogans: Long live the great unity of the world's people! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the great Chinese people! Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!
