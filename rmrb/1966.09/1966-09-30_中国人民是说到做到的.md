The Chinese people are imbued with the spirit of proletarian internationalism. They have contributed their strength and lives to aid the Korean people in their struggle against the American aggressors. Therefore, your statement of support for the Vietnamese people is not mere rhetoric.

The Chinese people are true to their word and have always stood on the side of justice and the people. This is admired by all peace-loving nations and peoples, and it strikes fear into the hearts of the American bandits and all reactionaries.

    中国人民是说到做到的
    中国人民是具有无产阶级国际主义精神的，曾经为援助朝鲜人民反对美国侵略者而贡献过自己的力量和生命；因此，你们发表的关于支持越南人民的声明，不是空话。
    中国人民是说到做到的，是一向站在正义人民这一边的。这一点，为所有爱好和平的民族和人民所赞赏，使美国强盗和一切反动派害怕。
