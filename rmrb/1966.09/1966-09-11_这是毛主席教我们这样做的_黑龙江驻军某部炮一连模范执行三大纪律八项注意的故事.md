The artillery company of a certain unit in the Heilongjiang garrison of the People's Liberation Army recently conducted a field exercise in the Dongfanghong Commune's Haigou Brigade. They strictly followed the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, as personally formulated by Chairman Mao, always putting the interests of the people first and safeguarding the interests of the people. They received enthusiastic praise from the local populace.

A Shell Hole

Under the moonlight, after the live-fire exercises on the range had ended, the reconnaissance soldiers of the forward observation post embarked on a new "battle." They climbed over the hill and searched the target area repeatedly to ensure that no shells had landed in the nearby farmland. They searched and searched, and finally found a shell hole at the edge of a soybean field, with shrapnel having damaged a small patch of soybean seedlings.

The company party branch seriously discussed this incident. The next morning, Deputy Political Instructor Liu Yujin and Reconnaissance Squad Leader Jiang Xiwu were dispatched to the production brigade to apologize and compensate for the damage. Liu Yujin and Jiang Xiwu climbed over several hills and walked more than twenty li to reach the village where the production brigade resided. When they explained their purpose, the brigade leader and the commune members refused to accept any money, saying, "Chairman Mao teaches us that the military and the people are one family. A few damaged plants are nothing; we can't accept the money!" Liu Yujin said, "The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention were personally formulated by Chairman Mao, and we must strictly follow them. Even if one plant is damaged, we must compensate for the loss." After much persuasion, the brigade leader, unable to refuse any longer, reluctantly accepted the compensation. Poor peasant commune member Wang Shou said:

"Before liberation, the reactionary army here would curse and beat us, burn and kill, and trample our crops as a matter of course, causing us immense suffering. Now, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army accidentally damaged a few soybean seedlings and came all this way to apologize and compensate us. They are truly the people's good sons and daughters! They are truly soldiers educated by Chairman Mao!"

A Tire Track

"Revolutionary soldiers must always remember the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention..." A disciplined column marched through the fields, chanting slogans and singing songs.

Where were they going? It turned out that the artillery company had recently conducted a tactical exercise. Due to terrain limitations, the artillery had to pass through the production brigade's freshly plowed wheat stubble field. After the exercise, everyone discussed the matter. Company Commander Wang Jiafang said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that everything must be done with the people's interests in mind. Our artillery has left tire tracks on the production brigade's freshly plowed field, which goes against the people's interests. We must not leave this tire track on the brigade's field." That night, the party branch decided to go to the production brigade and plow over the tire track.

The leader of the Fourth Production Brigade, Wang Wancai, heard about this and excitedly told the company's political instructor, Sui Qiaosong, "You think of the people's interests so thoroughly."

Six Iron Nails

During the field exercise, the radio communication team borrowed six iron nails from poor peasant commune member Yang Dage. Although it was a small matter, the soldiers always kept it in mind. They said, "We are the people's soldiers educated by Chairman Mao, and we must treat the people's property as more precious than Mount Tai."

On the eve of the end of the field exercise, Squad Leader Gao Qingkai personally went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy six iron nails and returned them to Yang Dage. Initially, Yang Dage refused to accept them, saying, "What's the big deal about a few nails? Not to mention six nails, even if it were sixty nails, you could use them without worrying." Gao Qingkai explained to Yang Dage, "This is what Chairman Mao taught us to do." Yang Dage, holding the nails, said excitedly, "From these six nails, I see your iron discipline. I see that you truly listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to his instructions!"

    “这是毛主席教我们这样做的”
    ——黑龙江驻军某部炮一连模范执行三大纪律八项注意的故事
    人民解放军黑龙江驻军某部炮一连，最近在东方红公社海沟大队野营，严格执行毛主席亲手制定的三大纪律八项注意，事事从人民群众的利益出发，处处维护人民群众的利益，受到当地群众热烈的赞扬。一个炮弹坑
    深夜，明月当空，靶场上实弹射击的炮声刚停，前沿观察所的侦察兵们又投入了一场新的“战斗”。大家翻过山头，来到目标区域，反复检查是否有炮弹落在目标区附近的庄稼地里。找啊，找啊，最后在一块黄豆地的边沿发现了一个炮弹坑，弹片炸伤了一小片豆秧。
    连队党支部认真研究了这件事。第二天一早，派了副指导员刘雨钦和侦察班长姜希武去生产队登门道歉赔偿。刘雨钦和姜希武翻过几个山头，跑了二十多里路，来到生产队住的村子。当他们说明了来意，生产队长和社员们说啥也不收钱，都说：“毛主席教导咱军民是一家，伤几棵庄稼算个啥，我们不能收钱！”刘雨钦说：“三大纪律八项注意是毛主席亲自制定的，我们一定要坚决执行，就是伤一棵我们也要赔偿损失。”推来让去，经他们再三说服，队长推托不过，只好收下了。贫农社员王寿说：
  “解放前，反动派的军队在这里，开口就骂，动手就打，烧的烧，杀的杀，糟踏我们的庄稼更是家常便饭，可把人们坑害苦啦。现在，解放军同志无意伤了几棵豆秧，还大老远跑来道歉赔款，真是人民的好子弟兵！真是毛主席教育出来的好战士！”一条汽车轮痕
      “革命军人个个要牢记，三大纪律八项注意……”一列整齐的队伍，一路口号一路歌，走向田野。
    他们干啥去了？原来，炮一连在不久前进行战术演习时，因地形条件限制，炮车不得不从生产队刚刚翻耕的麦茬地里通过，演习结束后，大家就议论起来。连长王家芳说：“毛主席教导我们，一切要从人民的利益出发。我们的炮车辗了生产队刚刚翻过的地，这是违反了群众的利益，我们决不能给生产队的地上留下这道汽车轮痕。”当天晚上，党支部研究确定去给生产队把这条轮痕翻掉。
    第四生产队队长王万才听说这事后，激动地对炮一连指导员隋乔松说：“你们对人民的利益想得太周到啦。”六个铁钉
    在野营期间，无线电话班借了贫农社员杨大爷六只铁钉，虽然事不大，但战士们一直把它记在心上。他们说，我们是毛主席教导出来的人民子弟兵，对人民的财产，要看得比泰山还重。
    野营结束前夕，班长高庆凯派人专程到供销社买回六只铁钉，亲自送还给杨大爷。起初，杨大爷说啥也不收，他说：“咳！这点玩艺儿算啥，不用说六个铁钉，就是六十个铁钉，你们用了也不用挂心。”高庆凯给杨大爷解释说：“这是毛主席教我们这样做的。”杨大爷接过铁钉，激动地说：“从这六个铁钉，我看到了你们铁的纪律，看到了你们真是一心听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事呀！”
