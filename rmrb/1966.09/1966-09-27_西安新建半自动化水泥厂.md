	Xi'an's new semi-automated small cement plant—the Xi'an Cement Plant—has recently begun official production.

	Building such a cement plant with an annual production capacity of 12,000 tons of cement typically requires at least nine months and an investment of over 140 million yuan. However, due to the workers involved in constructing this cement plant studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, breaking superstitions, liberating their minds, and fully unleashing their revolutionary spirit, the task of building the plant was completed in just 89 days with an investment of 76 million yuan. Moreover, the engineering quality is excellent.

    西安新建半自动化水泥厂
    西安新建的半自动化小型水泥厂——西安水泥厂最近正式投入生产。
    建设这样一座年产一万二千吨水泥的半自动化水泥厂，按照常规，至少需要花九个月时间，需要投资一百四十多万元。由于参加建设这个水泥厂的职工，活学活用毛主席著作，破除迷信，解放思想，充分发挥了革命干劲，结果只用八十九天时间，花了七十六万元资金，就完成了建厂任务，而且工程质量良好。
