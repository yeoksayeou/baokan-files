Many representatives from Asian and African countries and regions who participated in the emergency conference of Asian and African writers in Beijing recently expressed their impressions of their visit to China to a reporter from our news agency before leaving the country. They highly praised the proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in China with an irresistible force.

The representative from North Kalimantan, Wen Mingquan, said: "The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible and brilliant truth." He pointed out: "Soviet revisionism emerged and developed in the absence of an ideological revolution in the Soviet Union. Today, Soviet revisionism, as the representative of the new bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union, has taken control of the entire state machinery." Wen Mingquan said: "The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a great concrete achievement of Mao Zedong's development of Marxism-Leninism to its peak, the latest development of the theory of class and class struggle, and the most powerful nuclear weapon to prevent the retreat of the world revolution."

The member of the Zimbabwe delegation, G. Shao'an, said: "Undoubtedly, the cultural revolution currently underway in China will not only greatly succeed in consolidating the unity of the Chinese people but will also prove to be of great benefit to the people of various Asian and African countries in their anti-imperialist struggle."

The representative from the Somali Coast ("French"), Muhammad Dahan, said: "The proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in China aims to eliminate the influence of the bourgeoisie, reactionaries, and modern revisionism led by the Soviet Union." He said: "This is a sharp class struggle, which is incompatible."

The leader of the Swaziland delegation, Albert Nshumalo, said: "The proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in China is also a lesson for us. After the enemies with guns are defeated, enemies without guns still exist. We must stand firm, know who our enemies are and who our friends are, and resolutely oppose revisionists, reactionaries, and their accomplices."

The representative from Yemen, Salah Dahan, said, "The Chinese people, in their attack on a small number of bourgeois elements and revisionists, are creatively studying and applying the works of Chairman Mao. This cultural revolution is another brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought."

The leader of the Syrian delegation, Zadat Rikabi, said: "A new revolution is taking place in China's cultural and educational affairs. The guiding ideology of this revolution is Mao Zedong Thought." He said: "China's education combines education with productive labor. It does not cultivate people who, like those in capitalist society, only seek comfort and are detached from society, but cultivates people who have both knowledge and practical experience, serve the people, and build the country with correct work and labor. This is one of the noble purposes of socialist education that I have seen in China."

The representative from Laos, Zhalen Wongsang, said: "The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution deeply educates everyone. It tells us that winning revolutionary power does not mean the end of the revolution; there will still be class struggles in the process of building socialism. This proletarian cultural revolution is a fierce struggle. The vast majority of the Chinese people are determined to sweep away all monsters and demons. I firmly believe that this revolution will achieve a thorough victory."

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Conakry on September 1st, the famous Guinean singer Kuyaite Soli Kondi enthusiastically told a reporter from the New China News Agency in Conakry that Chairman Mao's policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers with literature and art is completely correct.

He said: "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of all countries. We sing of Chairman Mao because we love him and his great revolutionary thoughts."

Kondi said: "Chairman Mao's works have great educational significance for us. We are now studying Chairman Mao's works and will continue to study them forever."

    亚非作家说中国人民正在以排山倒海之势横扫一切牛鬼蛇神
    中国文化大革命是阶级斗争学说的最新发展
    新华社三日讯　参加在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议的许多亚非国家和地区的代表，不久前在离开我国时，向本社记者发表访华观感，高度评价我国正在以排山倒海之势进行的无产阶级文化大革命。
    北加里曼丹代表文铭权说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命再一次证明了，毛泽东思想是战无不胜的光辉真理。”他指出：“苏联修正主义就是在苏联意识形态的革命没有进行的情况下产生和发展起来的。今天，苏联修正主义已经作为苏联新资产阶级的代表掌握了整个国家机器。”文铭权说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东把马克思列宁主义发展到顶峰的伟大的具体成果之一，是阶级、阶级斗争学说的最新发展，是防止世界革命倒退的最有力的核武器。”
    津巴布韦代表团团员格·绍安说：“毫无疑问，中国正在进行的这场文化大革命不仅对巩固中国人民的团结将取得很大的成功，而且事实将证明，它会给进行反帝斗争的亚非各国人民带来极大的好处。”
    索马里海岸（“法属”）代表穆罕默德·达汗说：“中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，旨在铲除资产阶级、反动派和以苏联领导为首的现代修正主义的影响。”他说：“这就是尖锐的阶级斗争，这一斗争是水火不相容的。”
    斯威士兰代表团团长阿尔贝·恩修马洛说：“中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，对我们来说，也是一种教益。在拿枪的敌人被征服以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在。我们一定要站稳立场，知道谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，并且坚决反对修正主义分子、反动派及其合伙者。”
    也门代表萨利赫·达汉说，“中国人民在向一小撮资产阶级分子和修正主义分子进攻的过程中，正在创造性地研究和应用毛主席的著作。这场文化大革命是毛泽东思想的又一个光辉的胜利”。
    叙利亚代表团团长扎达特·里卡比说：“中国的文教事业正在进行着一场新的革命。这场革命的指导思想就是毛泽东思想。”他说：“中国的教育与生产劳动相结合，它不是培养像资本主义社会中那些只求舒适、脱离社会的人，而是培养既有知识，又有实践经验，为人民服务，用正确的工作和劳动来建设祖国的有用的人材。这就是我在中国所看到的社会主义教育的高尚目的之一。”
    老挝代表扎伦·翁桑昂说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命深深地教育了每一个人。它告诉我们，取得革命政权并不等于革命的结束，在建设社会主义过程中，还会充满着阶级斗争。这场无产阶级文化大革命的斗争很激烈。中国广大的人民群众决心横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。我坚信这场革命一定能够取得彻底胜利。”
    据新华社科纳克里一日电　几内亚著名歌唱家库雅特·索里·康迪亚在科纳克里热情洋溢地对新华社记者说，毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务的方针是完全正确的。
    他说：“毛泽东主席的确不但是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是各国革命人民的伟大领袖。我们歌唱毛主席，因为我们热爱他，我们热爱他的伟大的革命思想。”
    康迪亚说：“毛主席的著作对我们具有很大的教育意义。我们现在学习毛主席著作，而且将永远学习毛主席著作。”
