The U.S. imperialists are intensifying their aggressive deployments in Thailand. They are currently constructing a base capable of accommodating 100,000 U.S. troops for combat operations. The Thanom-Baiboon clique, under the command of the U.S. imperialists, is ruthlessly suppressing the people's struggles.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on September 18, Washington: The United States is accelerating its preparations to expand the war in Indochina. The Washington Star reported that the United States is constructing a logistics, supply, and transportation base in Thailand for 100,000 U.S. troops to engage in land, sea, and air operations.

This U.S. newspaper revealed on September 13 that the U.S. military authorities might decide at some point to launch a "pincer movement" from South Vietnam as the right wing and Thailand as the left wing against Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The U.S. "Ninth Logistics Command" is preparing for the left-wing forces in Thailand, and this preparation work is about half complete.

The U.S. military's "Ninth Logistics Command" is stationed in Korat. It is responsible for repairing combat equipment already stockpiled for use by one brigade (6,000 troops) of U.S. forces, as well as vehicles, barbed wire, bulldozers, and other equipment for use by an entire division (three brigades) of U.S. forces. It is also constructing oil pipelines for use by a corps (three divisions, 100,000 troops).

The U.S. 809th and 538th Engineer Battalions are constructing oil pipelines, roads, airports, wireless communication systems, and warehouses. The Thai authorities, under the supervision of the U.S. military, are also participating in the construction of these war-preparation projects.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on September 19, Bangkok: The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists and the Thanom-Baiboon clique for taking advantage of the severe floods in Thailand to launch a new, larger-scale "encirclement and suppression" campaign, ruthlessly suppressing the Thai people's anti-U.S. patriotic movement.

The radio station pointed out that the previous "encirclement and suppression" campaigns launched by the U.S.-Thai reactionaries have all failed, and the new evil "encirclement and suppression" campaign will also end in a miserable defeat.

The radio station revealed that under the personal command of the invading U.S. troops, the Thanom-Baiboon clique has deployed aircraft, border police, mixed military-police patrols, and police paratroopers to brutally suppress the people in the severely flood-affected areas of the northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima, Buri Ram, Nakhon Phanom, Udon Thani, and the northern province of Chiang Rai, Chang Kham County.

The radio station further revealed that the U.S. imperialists and the Thanom-Baiboon puppet clique are intensifying their preparations for a new, larger-scale "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the people in the northeastern and southern regions. Currently, a "special warfare force" composed of 5,000 U.S. invading troops and Thanom-Baiboon clique police has established 50 command centers in various areas of Thailand. The Thanom-Baiboon clique has divided three regiments of troops into "combat groups" and stationed them in the northeastern region.

The radio station also revealed that the U.S.-Thai reactionaries have established a so-called "Joint Security Center" in the northeast and set up radio stations in various areas to collect intelligence and direct the "encirclement and suppression." They have expanded the activities of the "local mobile construction teams," which carry out espionage and oppression against the Thai people, from 60 counties to 83 counties.

    据新华社十八日讯  华盛顿消息：美国正在泰国加紧进行扩大侵略印度支那战争的部署。据《华盛顿明星晚报》透露，美国正在泰国修建可供十万美军从事海陆空三方面作战的后勤、供应和运输基地。
    这家美国报纸九月十三日透露，美国军事当局可能在某一天决定以南越为右翼和以泰国为左翼向老挝和越南民主共和国发动一个“钳形攻势”。美国的“第九后勤司令部”正在泰国为左翼部队作准备，这项准备工作已经完成了大约一半。
    美军“第九后勤司令部”驻在呵叻，它负责维修已经储备好的可供一旅美军（六千人）使用的战斗装备，还有可供一整师（三个旅）美军使用的车辆、带刺铁丝、铲土机等装备。它还修建可供一个军团（三个师，十万人）使用的油管。
    美国第八○九和第五三八工兵营正在修建油管、公路、机场、无线电联络系统和仓库。泰国当局在美军的监督下，也参加修建这种备战工程。
    据新华社十九日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十六日强烈谴责美帝国主义和泰国他侬—巴博集团，趁泰国发生严重水灾的时机，加紧进行新的更大规模的“围剿”，疯狂镇压泰国人民的反美爱国运动。
    电台指出，过去美泰反动派发动的几次“围剿”都失败了，新的罪恶“围剿”也必将以惨败告终。
    电台揭露，在侵泰美军亲自指挥下，他侬—巴博集团出动了飞机、边防警察、军警混合巡逻队和警察伞兵队，残酷镇压东北部廊开府汶干县、奔披柿县，那空拍侬府那家县，乌隆府和北部清莱府昌堪县等重水灾地区的人民。
    电台进一步揭露，美帝国主义和他侬—巴博傀儡集团正在加紧部署对东北部和南部的人民进行新的更大规模的“围剿”。目前，由五千名美国侵略军和他侬—巴博集团警察联合组成的“特种战争部队”，已在泰国各区设立了五十个指挥部。他侬—巴博集团已把三个团的兵力分成“战斗小组”，驻扎在东北部地区。
    电台还揭露，美泰反动派在东北部成立了所谓“联合治安中心”，并在各个区设立收发电台，来收集情报、指挥“围剿”。他们把对泰国人民进行特务统治的“地方流动建设队”活动范围，从六十个县扩展到八十三个县。
