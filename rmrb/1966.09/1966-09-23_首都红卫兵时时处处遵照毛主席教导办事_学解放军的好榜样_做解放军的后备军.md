Every day at dawn, columns of Red Guards from the capital's universities and colleges march to the training grounds, singing revolutionary songs. They practice marching, bayonet thrusting, and grenade throwing in the morning light. After training, they begin their "daily reading," studying Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points.

"Learn from the People's Liberation Army, vow to be the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army," has become a common slogan and action for the capital's Red Guards. Many Red Guards copy the words and diaries of the PLA's heroic and model figures into their notebooks, learning their excellent qualities of loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, the Party, and the people, and vowing to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao and loyal servants of the people for life. In the capital's train stations, buses, shops, and public places, you can see Red Guards enthusiastically serving the people. They have done many good deeds. When people ask for their names, they always smile and say, "I am a Red Guard!"

The broad masses of Red Guards in the capital's universities and colleges believe that learning from the PLA is most importantly to learn from heroes like Lei Feng to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect, closely following Chairman Mao in the great storms of class struggle, and cultivating themselves into strong proletarian revolutionary fighters. Now, the broad masses of Red Guards in the capital all carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Whether they are writing big-character posters in school, going out to destroy the "Four Olds," or going out for revolutionary connections, many Red Guards, like the PLA, always actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in everything they do. They say, "Food can be skipped, sleep can be missed, but Chairman Mao's works must be studied." Some schools' Red Guards, when they first went out to destroy the "Four Olds," did not pay attention to mobilizing the masses. Later, they brought this problem to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions: "The Red Army is not just for fighting. In addition to fighting to destroy the enemy's military forces, it also has the important tasks of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish revolutionary political power, and even establishing Communist Party organizations." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, they seize every opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Sixteen Points to the masses, and from then on, wherever they go, they receive support and help from the local masses.

"The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" is one of the PLA songs that the capital's Red Guards love to sing the most. They not only sing it with their mouths and remember it in their hearts but also put it into action.

"Without correct political views, it is like having no soul." The Red Guards in various schools in the capital have universally established political departments, like the PLA, insisting on the Four Firsts, focusing on living thoughts, and determined to build the Red Guard organization into a combat team, study team, and propaganda team that is extremely proletarian and revolutionary. The Red Guards of Beijing Normal University, based on the PLA's experience of reminiscing about hardships and mobilizing before battle, organize everyone to reminisce about hardships and sweetness before each struggle against ghosts and snakes, conducting class education.

The Red Guards of Peking University learn from the PLA's democratic style, consult with the masses on matters, follow the mass line, and are determined to fight a "people's war" in the cultural revolution, relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses to complete the great historical tasks of one struggle, two criticisms, and three reforms. The Red Guards of the Red Guard Military School in Beijing also, like the PLA, when there are different opinions, put them on the table, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and finally reach a consensus, strengthening unity.

    首都红卫兵时时处处遵照毛主席教导办事
    学解放军的好榜样  做解放军的后备军
    他们努力活学活用毛主席著作，执行三大纪律八项注意，进行阶级教育，密切联系群众，操练军事，大做好事……，决心把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命战士
    据新华社二十二日讯　成长在我们伟大领袖毛主席身边的首都广大红卫兵，处处以人民解放军为榜样，努力把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命战士，使红卫兵组织真正成为人民解放军的坚强可靠的后备军。
    每天黎明，首都大中院校的一队队红卫兵战士就高唱着革命歌曲，奔向操场了。他们在晨光中操练队列动作，练习刺杀、投弹。出操以后，他们就开始了“天天读”，学习毛主席著作，学习十六条。
    “学习解放军，誓当解放军的后备军”，已经成为首都红卫兵的共同的口号和行动。许多红卫兵都把解放军英雄模范人物的话和日记抄在自己的本子上，学习他们忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于党、忠于人民的优秀品质，表示要一辈子做毛主席的好战士、人民的忠实勤务员。在首都的火车站、公共汽车、商店和公共场所里，到处都可以看到红卫兵小将们在热情地为群众服务。他们做了大量的好事，当人们要他们留下姓名时，他们总是笑着说：“我叫红卫兵！”
    首都大中学校的广大红卫兵们认为，学习解放军，最重要的是像雷锋等英雄那样活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，紧紧跟着毛主席在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼自己，把自己培养成为坚强的无产阶级革命战士。现在，首都广大红卫兵战士都随身带着《毛主席语录》。无论在学校写大字报，还是上街破“四旧”，或者是外出进行革命串连，许多红卫兵都像解放军那样，时时、事事、处处活学活用毛主席著作。他们说：“饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，毛主席著作非学不可。”有些学校的红卫兵，上街破“四旧”时，开始没注意发动群众，后来，他们带着这个问题，反复学习毛主席的教导：“红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”他们按照毛主席的这一指示，抓紧一切机会向群众宣传毛泽东思想，宣传十六条，从此，他们走到那里就受到那里群众的支持和帮助。
    《三大纪律八项注意》是首都红卫兵最爱唱的解放军歌曲之一。他们不仅唱在嘴上，记在心上，而且落实到行动上。
    “没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”首都各个学校的红卫兵普遍成立了政治部，像解放军那样，坚持四个第一，大抓活思想，决心把红卫兵组织建成非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的战斗队、学习队、宣传队。北京师范大学的红卫兵根据解放军战前开展忆苦、动员的经验，在每次斗争牛鬼蛇神之前，组织大家忆苦思甜，进行阶级教育。
    北京大学的红卫兵学习解放军的民主作风，遇事找群众商量，走群众路线，决心在文化大革命斗争中，打一场“人民战争”，依靠群众的智慧和力量，完成一斗、二批、三改的伟大历史任务。北京红卫兵战校的红卫兵们，还像解放军那样，有了不同意见，就把它摆到桌面上来，开展批评和自我批评，最后统一认识，增强了团结。
