Representatives of various ethnic minorities who came to Beijing to attend the National Day celebrations used different languages to wish Chairman Mao eternal life at a banquet. Vice Premier He Long, on behalf of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the State Council, extended the warmest welcome to the representatives.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 29th, at tonight's banquet hosted by Vice Chairman Saifuddin to welcome the National Day celebration delegation from various ethnic minorities across the country, over 600 representatives from 46 ethnic groups in 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country sang joyously in praise of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, expressing the deep affection, faith, and admiration of all ethnic groups in the country for the great leader.

The National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee and the Ethnic Affairs Commission presented each ethnic brother and sister representative with a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," a copy of the "Sixteen Points," and a copy of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee's communiqué. When representatives from various regions received these precious gifts at the banquet, the entire venue erupted in applause and cheers for several minutes. The representatives repeatedly shouted, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good students and good soldiers of Chairman Mao!"

Party and state leaders He Long, Xie Fuzhi, and relevant officials attended the banquet. Before the banquet began, Vice Premiers He Long and Xie Fuzhi, along with Vice Chairman Saifuddin, warmly met with some ethnic brother and sister representatives from across the country. Vice Premier He Long, on behalf of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the State Council, extended the warmest welcome to the ethnic brother and sister representatives. He encouraged everyone to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, master and use the "Sixteen Points," and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, making greater contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of our motherland.

Vice Chairman Saifuddin spoke at the beginning of the banquet.

Saifuddin said, the current central task for our ethnic brother and sister peoples is to carry the Cultural Revolution, which concerns the fate and future of our Party and country, through to the end. In rural and urban areas, in conjunction with the Cultural Revolution, we must carry the socialist education movement through to the end. We must seize the revolution and promote production, striving for victory in both revolution and production.

Saifuddin said, Chairman Mao is the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of all our ethnic peoples, the red sun in our hearts. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. We must further extensively promote the movement to study Chairman Mao's works among our ethnic brother and sister peoples, enabling the broad masses to grasp Mao Zedong Thought, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all ideological positions, using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the entire society's spiritual outlook, and turning Mao Zedong Thought, this great spiritual force, into a great material force. At the same time, we must resolutely oppose all sabotage activities by domestic and foreign enemies, further strengthen ethnic unity, consolidate national unity, and defend our motherland's borders.

When Saifuddin finally proposed a toast to the health of the great leader of all ethnic peoples, Chairman Mao, the over 600 representatives once again applauded and cheered for a long time, singing "The Ship Sails with the Helmsman" and "The East Is Red" loudly.

At the banquet, more than ten representatives from ten ethnic groups took turns to speak or sing, using different ethnic languages to wish our great leader, Chairman Mao, eternal life. After the banquet, as the representatives left the Great Hall of the People by car, they continued to sing song after song in praise of the great leader, Chairman Mao, along the way.

    宴会上，有十个民族的十多位代表一个接着一个起来致词祝酒或献歌，用不同民族的语言祝愿我们的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。宴会结束后，当代表们乘车离开人民大会堂时，一路上还轮番地纵情高唱一支又一支献给伟大领袖毛主席的赞歌。
