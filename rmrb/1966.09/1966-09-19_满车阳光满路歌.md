The morning in Beijing, the Route 11 trolleybus is waiting to depart at Xizhimen. The conductor has just boarded the bus, and behind her, a clear voice calls out:

"Conductor, do you have any propaganda for Chairman Mao's quotations on the bus?" At the door, two spirited Red Guards stand, facing the dawn, bathed in golden light, their red armbands glowing like flames in the sunlight. "Not yet!" the conductor replies. The two Red Guards immediately cheer and leap onto the bus.

Indeed, they have risen with the stars, walked through the morning dew, filled with eager hope, knocking on one car door after another, hoping to be the first to arrive. But they find that there are always others who have arrived before them. They always hear the same answer: "Already have it." They see unfamiliar comrades smiling warmly. Finally, they find a bus and gain another opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. How could they not be happy!

The bus slowly starts moving. They take out their wooden clappers and start tapping, "Clack, clack." Inside the car, dozens of pairs of eyes watch them attentively. The young warriors are calm and composed, smiling as they loudly recite, "Water that doesn't flow stinks, a boat that isn't repaired leaks, a gun that isn't cleaned rusts, a person who doesn't study Chairman Mao's works falls behind in thought..." The young warriors propagate with vigor, and the passengers listen intently, becoming more and more engrossed. Just then, the clapper sound suddenly stops, and a bright red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" appears in the hands of the young warriors. They shout with revolutionary passion, "Revolutionary comrades, let us study the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' together!" They then start reciting in a question-and-answer format. "Who is a complete revolutionary?" "Chairman Mao says: 'Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary...'" With these clear voices, passengers one by one take out their own copies of the quotations and follow the young warriors in reviewing Chairman Mao's teachings. The recitation echoes throughout the car.

Born in the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards have grown and advanced through the flames of battle. They want to sweep away all the filth of the old world, and they want to enthusiastically propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary fire burns through every street and alley, and it also reaches the buses and trolleybuses. Under the initiative of the young warriors, three red flags fly on the fronts of buses and trolleybuses, and inside the cars, Chairman Mao's portrait is hung neatly, and Chairman Mao's quotations are copied neatly. Under the leadership of the young warriors, the first thing the staff does before work is to bring "Quotations from Chairman Mao." A driver said, "Without reading 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' it's like driving without a steering wheel."

With hearts full of loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, the young warriors first initiated the reading of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in the cars, turning the cars into propaganda stations for Mao Zedong Thought. There are so many touching stories here! Sometimes, the car is extremely hot, and the young warriors are sweating profusely, but they still insist on their propaganda posts. Sometimes, the young warriors propagate on the bus for eight or nine hours straight. Whenever the conductor urges them to go home for a meal, they take out steamed buns or flatbread from their pockets and say with a smile, "We are prepared for continuous battle." Sometimes, even younger students rush onto the bus to propagate the quotations. Although they are young, they are so serious and enthusiastic. The red scarves against their young faces often remind you of the saying, "Flowers are red under the sun." These young warriors, although from different schools, all share a common belief: "We are the youth of the Mao Zedong era, the Party's propagandists. Propagating Mao Zedong Thought is a trust from the working people and our glorious mission!"

The Route 11 trolleybus is running in the sunlight, and more and more passengers are boarding. The two young warriors feel parched, and they look up at Chairman Mao's portrait. Chairman Mao is smiling at them kindly. They look down at their red armbands, which seem to tell them, "We are Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards." Suddenly, they feel refreshed and full of energy. They confer for a moment and then squeeze to the middle of the car, shouting, "Comrade Lin Biao said: Teaching a good song is actually an important political lesson. Let's sing 'The Ship Needs a Helmsman' together, shall we?" "Yes!" This is the response from all the passengers. The young warriors act like experienced commanders, waving their hands and leading all the passengers to sing the voice of the broad masses, singing out their love for Chairman Mao. As the song ends, passengers eagerly request, "Lead us in another song!" "Lead us in another song!" Revolutionary songs are sung one after another, and even the conductor, while busy selling tickets, can't help but join in the singing. The entire car is filled with singing and cheering. The trolleybus is speeding along, and the revolutionary songs echo through the streets. In the singing, a young mother is instructing her child, "Look, they are truly Chairman Mao's good students. When you grow up, you should also become a Red Guard."

The bus is approaching the terminal. Passengers are preparing to get off. The Red Guards warmly bid farewell, "Revolutionary comrades, goodbye. Let us, on different work posts, together hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Dozens of enthusiastic hands reach out to shake hands with the young warriors, and dozens of fiery hearts beat as one. Several comrades who are about to return to Harbin say with fervor, "Young warriors, goodbye. We will definitely learn from you and bring the enthusiastic atmosphere of propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the capital back to Harbin, actively participating in the new high tide of the Cultural Revolution."

    满车阳光满路歌
    苗新
    北京的清晨，十一路无轨电车正在西直门等待出发。售票员刚跨上车，背后就传来了清脆的喊声：
  “售票员同志，车上有宣传毛主席语录的吗？”车门口站着两个飒爽英姿的红卫兵，迎着朝霞，披一身金光，红袖章在阳光下如跳动的火焰。“还没有呢！”售票员回答。这两个红卫兵立刻欢呼起来，一下便跳到了车上。
    是啊，他们顶星光，踏晨露，怀着热切的希望，叩过一个又一个的车门，满以为可以捷足先登，没料到还有比他们更早的。他们听到的总是“已经有了”的回答，看到的是车上不相识的同伴亲切的笑容。好不容易啊！找到了一个车，又获得了一个宣传毛泽东思想的场合，他们怎能不高兴！
    车缓缓地开动了。他们掏出竹板，“呱搭，呱搭”地敲起来，车厢里，几十双眼睛关切地望着他们。小将们从容不迫，面带笑容，在响亮的竹板声中齐声说着：“水不流要臭，船不补要漏，枪不擦要锈，人不学毛主席著作，思想要落后……”。小将们宣传得有劲儿，乘客们听得入了神，越听越爱听。正在这时候，竹板声骤然停息，红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》出现在小将的手中，他们满怀革命激情大声喊着：“革命的同志们，让我们一起来学习《毛主席语录》吧！”接着他们就一问一答地念起来了。“什么人是完全的革命派？”“毛主席说：‘什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，……’”随着这清晰的声音，乘客相继拿出了语录本，跟着小将重温毛主席的教导。朗读的声音，响遍了车厢内外。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的暴风雨中诞生的红卫兵，在战斗的烈火中锻炼成长，阔步前进。他们要荡涤一切旧世界的污泥浊水，他们要热情宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。革命的烈火燃遍了大街小巷，也烧到了汽车、电车上。在小将的倡议下，汽车、电车的车头上飘扬起三面红旗，车厢内端端正正地挂起了毛主席像，整整齐齐地抄录了毛主席语录。在小将的带动下，工作人员上班前的第一件事，就是带上《毛主席语录》。一位司机说：“不读《毛主席语录》，就好像开车没有方向盘。”
    小将们怀着一颗对党对毛主席无限忠诚的红心，首先发起了在车厢内宣读《毛主席语录》，把车厢变成了毛泽东思想的宣传站。这里有多少动人的事情啊！有时，车厢里异常闷热，小将们汗流浃背，仍然坚持在宣传阵地上。有时小将们在车上连续宣传达八、九个小时，每当售票员劝他们回去吃饭，他们就从口袋里掏出馒头、火烧，笑嘻嘻地说：“我们就是准备连续作战的。”有时，小同学也抢着上车来宣传语录，尽管他们年纪小，但他们却是那样的认真严肃，那样的满腔热情。红领巾映着一张张稚气的笑脸，常常让你想起这样一句话：“太阳底下花儿红”。这些小将虽然来自不同的学校，但都怀着一个共同的信念：“我们是毛泽东时代的青少年，是党的宣传员，宣传毛泽东思想是劳动人民对我们的委托，是我们的光荣任务！”
    十一路无轨电车在阳光下行驶着，乘客越来越多。这两个小将，感到口干舌燥，他们抬头看看毛主席像，毛主席正慈祥地对他们微笑。他们低头看看红袖章，红袖章好像在告诉他们：“我们是毛主席的红小兵。”顿时他们感到遍体凉爽，精神百倍。他们低头商议了一阵，便挤到车厢的正中，高喊：“林彪同志说：教一首好的歌子，实际上也是一堂重要的政治课。我们来唱一支《大海航行靠舵手》好不好？”“好！”这是全体乘客的回答。年青的小将俨然成了老练的指挥员，他们挥舞着双手，领着全体乘客唱出了广大人民的心声，唱出了广大人民对毛主席的热爱。歌声刚歇，乘客就纷纷提出了要求：“再领着我们唱一支吧！”“再领着我们唱一支吧！”革命歌曲唱了一支又一支，连售票员也一边忙着卖票，一边情不自禁地引吭高歌。整个车厢在欢唱，在高歌。电车在快速行驶，革命歌声传遍了沿途的街道。在歌声中，一位年青的妈妈在嘱咐自己的孩子：“你瞧瞧，他们真是毛主席的好学生，你长大了也要当个红卫兵。”
    车快到终点站了，乘客纷纷准备下车。红卫兵热情地向大家告别，“革命的同志，再见了，让我们在不同的工作岗位上，共同高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”几十双热情的手，抢着和小将握手道别，几十颗火热的心，跳动在一起。即将回到哈尔滨的几位同志，激情洋溢地说：“小将们，再见了，我们一定要向你们学习，把首都轰轰烈烈宣传毛泽东思想的风气带回哈尔滨，积极投身到文化大革命的新的高潮中去。”
