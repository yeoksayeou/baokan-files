Albanian artists from various professional troupes have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Albanian Labor Party to "serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers with art" and to "carry the ideological and cultural revolution deeper in all aspects." They have gone to the countryside and factories, participating in physical labor and performing for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Since the beginning of the year, twenty-five professional art troupes have performed 812 times at production sites in industry and agriculture and at military camps, with an audience of 216,000. Their performances, which praise the party and the leaders, the advanced figures among workers, peasants, and soldiers, the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and which are themed around opposing imperialism and modern revisionism, have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

This year, art troupes belonging to the Albanian People's Army have formed ten performance teams to go to the most remote mountain areas and border regions to perform for local farmers and border guards for a month. Just the five performance teams of the People's Army Song and Dance Troupe have performed in 105 villages. The performers have fully demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship or fatigue, fighting continuously. They work four to five hours during the day and perform for the local residents in the evening.

During their tour, the performance teams of the Albanian People's Army, in addition to enthusiastically helping the countryside and the army to carry out revolutionary cultural activities, have also held 223 discussion sessions with farmers and soldiers, exchanging information about the construction and life in cities, countryside, and the army. Comrades from the People's Army Song and Dance Troupe who have visited China have also shared their impressions of their visit to China with the farmers and soldiers.

Recently, performers from the Albanian Folk Song and Dance Troupe, the Tirana Opera and Ballet Theater have also worked for twenty days in state farms and performed eleven times for the farm workers. The workers said: "We never imagined that you would come to the countryside to perform. Now we see that you not only perform for us but also participate in our farm work." The Durrës Theater and the Tirana People's Theater have also performed the Chinese plays "The Young Generation" and "The South Sea Great Wall" during their tours.

The performers have received profound education during their tours. They have all expressed their determination to learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers and to create and perform more and better songs, dances, and plays for them.

    阿尔巴尼亚艺术家上山下乡
    为工农兵演出  向工农兵学习
    地拉那人民剧院巡回演出了我国话剧《南海长城》
    新华社地拉那九日电　阿尔巴尼亚各专业艺术团体热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党发出的“文艺为工人、农民、战士服务”、“把我们的思想革命和文化革命在各个方面深入下去”的号召，纷纷上山下乡，一面参加体力劳动，一面为广大工农兵群众演出。
    从年初到现在，全国已有二十五个专业艺术团体到工农业生产第一线和驻军营地演出八百一十二场，观众达二十一万六千人次。他们演出的歌颂党和领袖、歌颂工农兵先进人物、歌颂社会主义革命和社会主义建设以及以反对帝国主义和现代修正主义为主题的许多节目，受到广大工农兵群众的热烈欢迎。
    今年以来，阿尔巴尼亚人民军所属的各艺术团体组成十个演出队到最偏僻的山区和边境地区给当地农民和边防战士演出了一个月。仅人民军歌舞团的五个演出队就在一百零五个村庄进行了巡回演出。演员们充分发扬了不怕苦不怕累，连续作战的革命精神，他们白天劳动四、五个小时，晚间为当地居民演出。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军的演出队在巡回演出期间，除满怀革命热情帮助农村和部队开展革命的文艺活动外，还同农民和战士举行了二百二十三次座谈会，交流城、乡和部队的建设和生活情况。访问过中国的人民军歌舞团的同志，还向农民和战士畅谈了访华观感。
    阿尔巴尼亚民间歌舞团、地拉那歌剧和芭蕾舞剧院的演员们，最近也在国营农场劳动二十天，为农场工人演出了十一场。工人们说：以前我们根本不敢想象你们会下乡演出，现在我们看到你们不但给我们演出，而且还参加我们农场的劳动。都拉斯剧团和地拉那人民剧院在巡回演出时，还分别演了中国话剧《年青的一代》和《南海长城》。
    演员们在巡回演出中受到了深刻的教育，他们纷纷表示，今后决心向工农兵学习，为工农兵创作和演出更多更好的歌曲、舞蹈和戏剧。
