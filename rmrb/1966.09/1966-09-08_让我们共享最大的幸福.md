The news that Chairman Mao received a million cultural revolution troops on August 18th spread across the country, stirring everyone's hearts. They eagerly awaited the moment to see our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, on the screen. Many units and individuals sent telegrams and letters to the Central Newsreel Film Studio, urging them to hurry! hurry! hurry! and produce the documentary of this grand meeting for nationwide screening.

We are soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Chongqing, Sichuan, far from the capital. With hearts pounding with excitement, we sent a telegram to you, hoping that we could see our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao inspecting the million-strong cultural revolution troops in military uniform on the screen as soon as possible. Comrades of the Central Newsreel Film Studio, please hurry! hurry! hurry! and produce this film quickly and well.

August 18th was our happiest day. We heard the live broadcast of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, reviewing the cultural revolution troops at Tiananmen. Even now, our hearts are still filled with excitement.

We are teachers working on the Tibetan Plateau, far from the capital. We think of Chairman Mao day and night. We eagerly look forward to seeing the moving scene of Chairman Mao with the million-strong cultural revolution troops on August 18th. We sincerely request that you send this film to Tibet as soon as possible, so that we can share the greatest happiness with the people of the capital.

We are students from the steel city of the grasslands—Baotou. Although we are far from the capital, our hearts are connected with our great leader Chairman Mao! We are always together! How we long to see our great leader Chairman Mao! Especially in this great proletarian cultural revolution, we think of Chairman Mao during the day and dream of him at night. Although we cannot see Chairman Mao in person, we always hope to see him in the movies. We hope that your studio will quickly produce the documentary of Chairman Mao and the million-strong revolutionary troops celebrating the cultural revolution on August 18th, preferably in color, capturing the scene of Chairman Mao in his green military uniform and the moving scene of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and revolutionary masses.

Please fulfill our request and produce the film as soon as possible. Hurry! hurry! hurry!

    我们是远离首都驻守在四川重庆市的解放军战士。我们怀着十二万分激动的心情，打电报给你们，殷切地希望能尽快在银幕上看到我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席穿上军装检阅百万文化革命大军的雄壮场面。中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的同志们，务必请你们分秒必争，又快又好地制出这部片子，快！快！快！

    八月十八日，是我们最最幸福的一天，我们听到了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席在天安门检阅文化革命大军的实况录音。直到现在，我们激动的心情还不能平静。
