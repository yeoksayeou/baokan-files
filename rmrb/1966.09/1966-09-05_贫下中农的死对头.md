The Enemy of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

Lǐ Dá is a big landlord and the sworn enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants.

Before the land reform, my father worked as a day laborer in Lǐ Dá's household. Lǐ Dá's heart is black and cruel. He wouldn't pay for a few days of work, only for several dozen days. My father always did odd jobs, so he worked for Lǐ Dá for several dozen years without ever properly receiving a single cent, and instead owed the landlord Lǐ Dá's household money.

My old mother also worked as a day laborer and servant in Lǐ Dá's household, enduring for several dozen years. Lǐ Dá never gave her a single cent. My mother worked from dawn to dusk, carrying water, cooking, cleaning, and doing hard labor for the landlord Lǐ Dá, and was often beaten and scolded at his whim.

Lǐ Dá is a big bandit. He seized a lot of our poor peasants' land. Just before liberation, he was afraid of being labeled a landlord, so he exchanged his paddy fields for dry land to build an orchard. He wanted to fence in the orchard. Our family had a piece of land enclosed in Lǐ Dá's orchard, and he insisted on giving us a piece of dry land that was practically useless, forcing us to exchange with him. That's not all; at the end of the year, he said our family had farmed his land and forcibly took away five bushels of grain from us.

Our family has been oppressed by Lǐ Dá for generations. Before liberation, I myself worked as a servant for Lǐ Dá at Hunan University for two years, as a slave. He often beat and scolded me. Once, he hit my nose with a stick, and blood flowed like a cup, causing me to faint. When I woke up, I was scolded by him again. Lǐ Dá is such a big bully.

In 1949, Lǐ Dá secretly left Hunan University, leaving a dollar on the table and a note telling me to go back. Heaven, how could I return from Changsha to Lingling with just a dollar? Lǐ Dá is such a cruel man!

This time, this escaped landlord Lǐ Dá won't get away. We will thoroughly defeat Lǐ Dá and his gang and will never let them bully us again.

    贫下中农的死对头
    湖南零陵县蔡家公社
    油榨头大队贫农  李定业
    李达是个大地主，是我们贫下中农的死对头。
    我父亲土改前在李达家里帮短工。李达的心是黑的，很毒辣。给他做几天工是不给钱的，要给他做几十天才给钱。我父亲总是打零工，所以给他做了几十年，没有好生地得过他一分钱，反而欠了李达这个地主家的债。
    我的老母亲也给李达家打短工，当佣人，一直熬了几十年，李达从来不给一个钱。我母亲从早到黑，给地主李达挑水，做饭，倒屎倒尿，做苦工，还被李达任意打骂。
    李达是个大强盗，他霸占了我们贫农的很多土地。快到解放时，他怕划成地主，就把水田与别人换成旱地修果园。他要把果园围起来。我家有一块地被围在李达园子里，他硬要拿一块根本没有什么用的旱地，逼我家跟他换。这还不算，到了年终，说我家种了他的地，硬从我家抢走了五斗谷子。
    我家祖祖辈辈受李达的压迫。解放前，我自己也在湖南大学给李达当了两年佣人，做了两年奴隶。他经常打我骂我，有一次，我鼻子上被他打了一棍，血流了一茶杯多，我当时就昏倒了，醒来还被他臭骂了一顿。李达就是这样一个大恶霸。
    一九四九年，李达偷偷摸摸离开湖南大学，他放了一块钱在桌子上，留个信叫我回去。天老爷，一块钱我怎么能从长沙回到零陵？！李达这个家伙好狠呀！
    这一回，李达这个漏网地主跑不掉了，我们要把李达这一伙彻底打倒，绝不能再让他们欺侮我们。
