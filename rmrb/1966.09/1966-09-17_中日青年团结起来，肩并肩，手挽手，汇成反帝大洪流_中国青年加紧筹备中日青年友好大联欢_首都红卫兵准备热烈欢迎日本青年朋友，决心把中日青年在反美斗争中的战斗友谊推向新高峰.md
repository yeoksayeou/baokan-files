Chinese youth are hurriedly preparing for the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Rally, eagerly anticipating the arrival of Japanese youth friends to push the combat friendship between Chinese and Japanese youth in the anti-American struggle to new heights.

The news that the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Rally will be held in China has been met with enthusiastic responses from young people and the general public across the country. Many students, young workers, and young members of people's communes, as well as Red Guards who have grown up during China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have sent letters and telegrams to relevant departments, expressing their eager anticipation for the arrival of Japanese youth friends. Many have also actively participated in the preparations for the rally.

Red Guards in the capital have demonstrated a high level of proletarian internationalism in their participation in the preparations. Red Guards from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Academy of Arts and Design, the Beijing Film Academy, and the Central Academy of Drama have worked tirelessly for five days and nights to create a series of propaganda posters for the rally. A Red Guard from the Central Academy of Fine Arts said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The people who have won revolutionary victories should support the people who are fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty.' When we think of Chairman Mao's teachings and realize that we are contributing to the support of the Japanese people's anti-American struggle, we are full of energy and forget all fatigue." In some of the propaganda posters created by the Red Guards, they have used vigorous brushstrokes, vibrant colors, and moving scenes to depict the mighty momentum of the Chinese and Japanese peoples uniting to oppose their common enemy, American imperialism. A poster titled "Mao Zedong Thought is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" vividly expresses the boundless love, faith, and reverence of the revolutionary people of the world for the great leader Chairman Mao. Some posters have a red background with gold lettering quoting Chairman Mao: "Except for the pro-American monopolistic capitalists and militarist warlords, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." These drafts have already been sent to printing houses for production and printing. The postal department will produce and issue stamps based on these drafts nationwide.

The Red Guards in the capital have also created revolutionary songs and prepared many wonderful cultural performances to welcome Japanese youth. Red Guards from the Central Conservatory of Music, the China Conservatory of Music, and the 110th Middle School have worked through the night, composing nine revolutionary songs full of fighting spirit in just one night. After repeated discussions and revisions, the final selection, "Song of Chinese and Japanese Youth United in Struggle," is being widely taught among the youth. The lyrics of the song go: "Crossing the ocean, over the sea, Chinese and Japanese youth unite. Shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, forming a great anti-imperialist tide. United in struggle, struggle, we will not rest until we destroy American imperialism. The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought guides us forward to victory!" To express the Red Guards' firm support for the Japanese people's and youth's anti-American struggle, they are rehearsing a grand chorus with 2,000 participants, preparing to sing at the welcoming rally for Japanese youth friends, celebrating the combat friendship between the peoples and youth of China and Japan. Red Guards from the China National Academy of Traditional Chinese Opera and the Beijing Drama School are also rehearsing modern Beijing operas such as "The Red Lantern" day and night, preparing to perform for Japanese youth friends. To facilitate Japanese youth friends' understanding of the significance of China's Cultural Revolution and to exchange combat experiences, many school Red Guard organizations are summarizing their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle and the progress of the Cultural Revolution, preparing to introduce them to Japanese youth friends. In recent days, many Red Guard propaganda teams have taken to the streets, distributing leaflets and singing songs, widely publicizing the significance of this China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Rally.

In factories, people's communes, and many public places in the capital, extensive preparations have been made for the second China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Rally, preparing to warmly welcome the arrival of Japanese youth.

To facilitate the timely arrival of Japanese youth friends to China for the friendship rally, the broad masses of young people have requested sending ships to Japan to welcome distant guests. Relevant departments are actively preparing according to the masses' requests.

    中国青年加紧筹备中日青年友好大联欢
    首都红卫兵准备热烈欢迎日本青年朋友，决心把中日青年在反美斗争中的战斗友谊推向新高峰
    新华社十六日讯　中日两国青年渴望已久的第二届中日青年友好大联欢，预定不久将在我国举行。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国革命青年们，正以最大的热情加紧完成大联欢的各项筹备工作，热切地期待着同日本各界青年朋友们的亲切会见，要把中日两国人民和青年在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊推向新的高峰。
    这届中日青年友好大联欢将在我国举行的消息传出以后，得到了全国广大青年和人民的热烈响应。许多学生、青年工人、人民公社青年社员和在我国无产阶级文化大革命中成长起来的红卫兵小将们，纷纷给有关部门来信来电，要求转达他们盼望日本青年朋友们早日到来的迫切心情。许多人还积极参加了大联欢的筹备工作。
    首都的红卫兵在参加筹备工作中，发扬了高度的无产阶级国际主义精神。中央美术学院、中央工艺美术学院、北京电影学院、中央戏剧学院的红卫兵们，奋战五天五夜，为大联欢绘出了一幅幅宣传画。中央美术学院的一位红卫兵说，伟大的领袖毛主席告诉我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们一想到毛主席的这个教导，一想到我们是在为支持日本人民的反美斗争作出贡献，就浑身是劲，什么疲劳也忘记了。在红卫兵们创作的一些宣传画上，他们以刚健的笔调，鲜艳的色彩，和动人的画面，显示了中日两国人民团结起来反对共同敌人美帝国主义的磅礴气势。一幅题为《毛泽东思想是我们心中的红太阳》的宣传画，真切地表达了全世界革命人民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。有的宣传画的红色底面上用金字写着毛主席的语录：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”这些画稿都已交给印刷厂制作印刷。邮电部门将照这些画稿制成邮票在全国发行。
    首都的红卫兵们，还为欢迎日本青年创作了一些革命歌曲，准备了许多精彩的文娱节目。中央音乐学院、中国音乐学院和一一○中学的红卫兵，通宵创作，一夜之间写出了九首充满战斗激情的革命歌曲。经过大家反复讨论、反复修改后，最后选定的《中日青年团结战斗之歌》已在青年中广泛教唱。这首歌的歌词写道：“越过重洋穿过海，中日青年团结起来。肩并肩，手挽手，汇成反帝大洪流，团结一致战斗战斗，不消灭美帝誓不罢休。毛泽东思想伟大红旗，指引着我们向着胜利前进！”为了表达首都红卫兵对日本人民和青年反美斗争的坚决支持，他们正在排练有二千人参加的大合唱，准备在欢迎日本青年朋友们的大会上，高歌中日两国人民和青年的战斗友谊。中国戏曲学校、北京戏剧专科学校的红卫兵，也正在日夜赶排京剧现代戏《红灯记》等节目，准备为日本青年朋友们表演。为了便于日本青年朋友了解中国文化大革命的意义和相互交流斗争经验，许多学校的红卫兵组织，正在纷纷总结他们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的体会和文化大革命进行的情况，准备向日本青年朋友作介绍。连日来，许多红卫兵组织宣传队走上街头散发传单，演唱歌曲，广泛宣传这届中日青年友好大联欢的意义。
    在首都的工厂、人民公社和许多公共场所，也为这届中日青年友好大联欢进行了许多准备工作，准备热情地迎接日本青年的到来。
    为了便利日本青年朋友及时来我国进行友好大联欢，广大的青年群众要求派船去日本迎接远方的客人。有关方面已根据群众的要求，正在积极进行准备。
