Comrade Hill and his wife, Mrs. Hill, visited Peking University today in the afternoon. The university is advancing triumphantly in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At 3 p.m., Comrade Hill and Mrs. Hill, accompanied by Comrade Zhao Yimin, a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, arrived at Peking University. They were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University and by revolutionary teachers and students from other places who had come to Peking University to visit and learn.

After listening to Comrades Nie Yuanzi and others report on the situation of the Cultural Revolution at Peking University and the victories already achieved, Comrade Hill and Mrs. Hill visited the "New Peking University Cultural Revolution Exhibition."

Comrade Hill and Mrs. Hill wrote in the visitors' book of the exhibition: "The depth of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has left a profound impression on us and greatly inspired us. Peking University indeed has great inspirational value in carrying the proletarian revolution through to the end. Being wholeheartedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely implementing Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle will ensure that the proletarian revolution achieves victory not only in China but throughout the world."

After visiting the exhibition, Comrade Hill and Mrs. Hill also looked at the big-character posters in the campus. They were once again warmly welcomed by the revolutionary teachers and students.
