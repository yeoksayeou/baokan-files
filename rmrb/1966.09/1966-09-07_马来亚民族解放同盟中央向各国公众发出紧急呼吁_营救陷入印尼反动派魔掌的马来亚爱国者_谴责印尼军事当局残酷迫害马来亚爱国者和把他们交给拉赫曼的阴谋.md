The Central Committee of the Malayan National Liberation League has issued an urgent appeal to the public of all countries, especially the progressive institutions, organizations, and individuals in Asia and Africa, to take immediate action to rescue the four members of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in Indonesia from the clutches of the Indonesian military authorities and the neo-colonialist "Malaysia" group led by Abdul Rahman.

In an urgent appeal issued on August 15, the Central Committee of the Malayan National Liberation League stated that the members of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in Indonesia, including the delegation leader Ibrahim Mohammed, deputy leader Yu Zhu Ye, secretary Abdulah Sudin, and delegation member Shamshiya Fakhr, have been illegally detained by the Indonesian military authorities in the Strategic Intelligence Section of the National Defense Security Department since November 18, 1965. During their long period of illegal detention, these brave fighters for Malayan independence and Asian-African solidarity have been subjected to various threats, insults, and all kinds of humiliation and mental torture by the Indonesian reactionary military authorities. Some of them have contracted chronic illnesses, and all appeals for medical treatment have been rejected. One member was severely beaten. The delegation's residence was illegally occupied by a group of reactionary students, and the delegation's property was illegally seized by those who arrested them.

The appeal states that the Indonesian military authorities originally attempted to use various methods to coerce the Malayan patriots into admitting that they were agents of a certain great power and to force the Malayan patriots to side with the military authorities in the current situation in Indonesia, turning the Malayan patriots into tools for implementing their reactionary policies. The delegation members resolutely refused to fall into their trap or be intimidated by them. The appeal reveals that when the Indonesian military authorities realized that their usual tactics of dividing political prisoners had failed, they adopted the tactic of ignoring the Malayan patriots, attempting to block their resistance. Finally, the Indonesian military authorities completely refused to meet with the Malayan patriots or listen to their demands and protests, even avoiding accepting their letters.

The appeal further points out that following the Bangkok talks, the open collusion between Indonesia and "Malaysia" has placed the Malayan patriots in a serious situation. Officials of the Indonesian military authorities have openly discussed the possibility of handing them over to "Malaysia."

The appeal points out that the arrest and detention of members of the Malayan National Liberation League and the Indonesian military authorities' attempt to hand them over to the Abdul Rahman group are illegal. This is because the delegation was officially recognized by the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and had a legal status in Indonesia. Furthermore, during a meeting in mid-June 1966 with members of the delegation, an official of the Indonesian military authorities stated that the case had been "resolved" and that they were not being "detained" but were being "protected" because the situation in Jakarta was still "serious." This itself is an irrefutable evidence that there was never any legitimate reason for their detention from the beginning.

The appeal states that during the aforementioned meeting in June, the delegation members protested against their continued detention and once again demanded their immediate release and permission to leave Indonesia to go to a country of their own choice. They formally declared their refusal to be sent to "Malaysia" and decided to go to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam upon their release. The Indonesian official considered the matter "soon to be handled."

The appeal states that two months have passed since the aforementioned meeting, but the Indonesian military authorities have not fulfilled their promise of release. Instead, they have exposed their intention to collude with the Abdul Rahman group, attempting to further persecute these friends of the Indonesian people.

The appeal states that on July 28, the delegation members formally wrote a letter to the Indonesian authorities, strongly protesting against the attempt to send them to "Malaysia" and reiterating their decision to go to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The appeal states: "These members of our delegation in Indonesia are victims of the savage political persecution by the Indonesian military authorities, and their basic human rights have been trampled upon. All support for rescuing our revolutionary freedom fighters will be a significant contribution to Asian-African solidarity and the global struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, and all reactionaries led by American imperialism."

### 马来亚民族解放同盟中央向各国公众发出紧急呼吁  营救陷入印尼反动派魔掌的马来亚爱国者  谴责印尼军事当局残酷迫害马来亚爱国者和把他们交给拉赫曼的阴谋

    马来亚民族解放同盟中央向各国公众发出紧急呼吁
    营救陷入印尼反动派魔掌的马来亚爱国者
    谴责印尼军事当局残酷迫害马来亚爱国者和把他们交给拉赫曼的阴谋
    据新华社六日讯　马来亚民族解放同盟中央委员会在一份紧急呼吁书中，呼吁所有进步的特别是亚非国家的机构、团体和个人采取紧急行动，从印度尼西亚军事当局和新殖民主义“马来西亚”的阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼集团的魔掌中，把马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团的四名成员营救出来。
    马来亚民族解放同盟中央委员会在八月十五日发表的这份紧急呼吁书说，马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团的成员，其中包括代表团团长易卜拉欣·穆罕默德、副团长余柱业、秘书阿卜杜拉·苏丁和代表团成员沙姆西亚·法克赫，自一九六五年十一月十八日迄今，一直被印度尼西亚军事当局非法拘留在国防安全部组战略情报司。在他们被非法拘留的长时间内，这些为马来亚独立和亚非团结而战斗的英勇战士们，曾受到印度尼西亚反动军事当局的种种威胁、侮辱和所有能想象的耻辱和精神上的折磨。他们中间有一些人得了慢性病。要求得到医疗待遇的一切呼吁都被拒绝。其中有一个成员严重地被拳打脚踢。代表团的住地被一群反动学生非法占领，代表团的财物被逮捕他们的人非法抢走。
    呼吁书说，印度尼西亚军事当局原来企图用各种方法诱迫马来亚爱国者承认他们是某一个大国的代理人，并迫使马来亚爱国者在印度尼西亚当前形势下站在军事当局一边，把马来亚爱国者变成推行他们的反动政策的工具。代表团的成员坚决拒绝上他们的圈套或被他们所吓倒。呼吁书揭露说，当印度尼西亚军事当局发觉他们使用惯伎分化政治犯已经遭到失败时，他们就采用不理睬马来亚爱国者的办法，妄图阻挡马来亚爱国者的抵抗。最后，印度尼西亚军事当局完全拒绝接见马来亚爱国者或倾听他们的要求和抗议，甚至避不接受他们的信件。
    呼吁书接着指出，随着曼谷会谈后印度尼西亚和“马来西亚”之间的公开勾结，马来亚爱国者面临着严重的处境，印度尼西亚军事当局的官吏们竟公开谈论到把他们交给“马来西亚”的可能性。
    呼吁书指出，逮捕和拘留马来亚民族解放同盟的成员以及印度尼西亚军事当局妄想把他们交给阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼集团的企图都是非法的，因为代表团是得到印度尼西亚外交部正式承认的，在印度尼西亚具有合法的地位；其次，在一九六六年六月中旬和代表团成员举行的一次会议上，印度尼西亚军事当局的一个官吏说，此案业已“解决”。并说他们并非被“拘留”中，而是“被保护”中，因为雅加达的情况仍然“严重”。这本身就是一个无可辩驳的证据，说明从一开始就没有过任何足以拘留他们的正当理由。
    呼吁书说，在六月间和这个印度尼西亚官吏举行的上述会议上，代表团的成员们曾抗议对他们继续拘留，并再一次要求立即释放他们和允许他们离开印度尼西亚，到一个由他们自己选择的国家去。他们正式宣布拒绝被送往“马来西亚”，并决定在释放后去越南民主共和国。这个印度尼西亚官吏认为此事“即将处理”。
    呼吁书说，上述会议后，两个月已经过去了，但是，印度尼西亚军事当局并没有实行释放他们的诺言。相反，却暴露出勾结阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼集团的意图，妄图对印度尼西亚人民的这些朋友进行进一步的迫害。
    呼吁书说，七月二十八日，代表团的成员正式写信给印度尼西亚当局，再次强烈抗议把他们送往“马来西亚”的企图，并重申要求去越南民主共和国的决定。
    呼吁书说：“我们驻印度尼西亚代表团的这些成员是印度尼西亚军事当局野蛮的政治迫害的受害者，他们的基本人权遭到了践踏。为营救我们的革命自由战士的一切支持，对亚非团结和全世界反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义、殖民主义、新殖民主义和一切反动派的斗争，将是一个重大的贡献。”
