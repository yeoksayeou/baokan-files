Red Guards and revolutionary masses across the country are fighting and studying simultaneously to become brave and wise warriors. With truth in hand, the power of ideological struggle is immense. Millions upon millions of big-character posters have been put up, forming a vast net that leaves no hiding place for all the monsters and demons. Millions upon millions of people are engaging in great debates, and they will certainly overthrow, smash, and expose the enemy.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on September 6, Red Guards and revolutionary masses across the country, who are advancing victoriously in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are studying the two important speeches made by Comrade Lin Biao on behalf of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in conjunction with their actual struggles. They are determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points in their struggles. They will continue to uphold the revolutionary spirit of daring to fight and being good at fighting. They will fully utilize the weapons of big-character posters and great debates to expose and criticize all monsters and demons politically and ideologically, overthrowing, smashing, and exposing them completely.

Red Guards and revolutionary masses in the capital have expressed their determination to fully implement the Sixteen Points. Many revolutionary teachers and students from Dongfanghong Middle School (formerly Dengshikou Girls' School) in Beijing have expressed their belief that truth is in the hands of the revolutionary masses. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, by presenting facts and reasoning, and through thorough exposure and criticism, they can certainly achieve a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution. They are preparing to further expose and criticize the capitalist roaders in power within their unit. Some Red Guards in Xicheng District of the capital recently focused on studying Chairman Mao's works, the Sixteen Points, and learning from the People's Liberation Army. They also summarized their previous work. They said, "We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and take the Sixteen Points as our guide to action, learning ideological struggle and learning to think."

In Shanghai, Cai Zucu, an expert in electric lighting who comes from a worker's family, said, "The broad masses have written millions upon millions of revolutionary big-character posters. One by one, they form a vast net that leaves no hiding place for monsters and demons. The broad masses engage in great debates, thoroughly exposing and deeply criticizing, fully revealing the reactionary words and deeds of monsters and demons, and completely overthrowing them." Many revolutionary students from the former Xinzhong Middle School said: "A handful of rightist elements of the bourgeoisie are most afraid of being thoroughly exposed and deeply criticized. We use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to expose their true colors, and they are terrified." Retired worker Zhou Gaosheng, who participated in the May 30th Movement, and worker Zhang Fucheng said, "Truth is in our hands. Through reasoned struggle, we will certainly subdue the enemy."

Red Guards from the August 18th Successor Middle School in Guangzhou said: "We will use Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to expose and criticize the crimes of all monsters and demons one by one, making them like rats crossing the street, despised by everyone, with no chance of revival." They also established a system of fighting and studying simultaneously, allocating a certain amount of time each day to study Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points.

Red Guards and revolutionary students in Chengdu pointed out based on their personal experiences that to fully implement the Sixteen Points, one must first uphold the revolutionary spirit of daring to fight. One must dare to fight and be good at fighting.

Many Red Guards in Tianjin are fighting, studying, and summarizing experiences simultaneously. Red Guards from Dongfanghong Middle School No. 5 said, "With the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, and with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers as our backing, we fear neither heaven nor earth, neither ghosts nor gods. We dare to smash the old world completely and create a new world for the proletariat."

Many Red Guards from Huadong Water Conservancy Institute in Nanjing said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the weapon to defeat the enemy and the compass of the Cultural Revolution. We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words and forge ourselves into upright proletarian warriors who stand tall and master revolutionary skills." Red Guards from Nanjing No. 4 Girls' School said, "We must stand the test in storms and tempests, tempering ourselves into tough revolutionaries and becoming brave and wise warriors."

Broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Red Guard fighters, and revolutionary teachers and students in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Luoyang are studying Comrade Lin Biao's speeches and relevant commentaries on the Cultural Revolution in the People's Daily. Red Guards from Zhengzhou University, after returning from Beijing, summarized their previous work. They said: "Under any circumstances, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought like the PLA, daring to revolutionize and being good at revolutionizing."

Red Guards and revolutionary youth in the heroic city of Nanchang have been studying the Sixteen Points and Comrade Lin Biao's speeches in conjunction with their struggles, and their revolutionary spirit is more vibrant. Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from the Communist Labor University said: "We will take Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, fully implement the Sixteen Points, and sweep away all monsters and demons."
