Red Guards comrades, in recent days, you have followed the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, wielding the revolutionary hammer, thoroughly smashing the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News," achieving brilliant results. All revolutionaries are delighted and proud of your achievements. We are proud to have such revolutionary pioneers as you!

Red Guards and we militia are both the reserve forces of the People's Liberation Army. We must build our ranks to be more revolutionary. The most important thing is to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, just like the People's Liberation Army, to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The People's Liberation Army has many things worth learning from. In recent years, our militia company has felt that the high level of organizational discipline and self-awareness of the People's Liberation Army is an extremely important aspect that we need to strive to learn.

My elder brother, the late First-Class Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers and great internationalist fighter, Qiu Shaochun, was a model of strictly adhering to revolutionary discipline. He sacrificed himself while on a mission to infiltrate enemy lines. At that time, an incendiary bomb fell about two meters away from him, and his body caught fire. Although there was a ditch behind him, if he had retreated a few steps and rolled in the muddy water, he could have extinguished the fire, but he did not do so. Because he knew that if he did, he might make a noise, be discovered by the enemy, and cause the revolution to suffer losses. He remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army is powerful because all those who join it have a high degree of self-discipline; they are not fighting for the private interests of a few or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the entire nation." My elder brother, in order not to affect the safety of more than five hundred comrades in the infiltration team and the victory of the entire battle, lay motionless on the ground like an iron man, enduring unimaginable physical pain, allowing the flames to burn his entire body, and finally sacrificed himself gloriously, ensuring the successful completion of the infiltration mission by the entire team and winning the victory of the battle.

Where did Qiu Shaochun's high level of organizational discipline come from? It is the result of high political awareness of the proletariat, the result of his faithful and serious execution of Chairman Mao's teachings: "To regard revolutionary interests as one's first life, and to subordinate personal interests to revolutionary interests." In a word, it is the result of being nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong.

In recent years, our militia company has always listed learning Qiu Shaochun's excellent qualities of strictly adhering to organizational discipline as an important item. In production and labor, we pay attention to strictly observing production discipline and always safeguarding the interests of the people; in the face of difficulties, we listen to commands and respond to calls, tackling the toughest problems. Once, we participated in a basic agricultural construction project and suddenly discovered a large rock about to roll down. The militia standing on the edge of the cliff was in danger of being knocked down. At this critical moment, militia member Zhang Huazheng, risking his life, rushed up and used his body to block the huge rock, preventing the accident. The masses praised him as the "living Lei Feng."

In the process of learning from Qiu Shaochun, our militia company deeply realized that high organizational discipline is the basic guarantee for building a revolutionary force and successfully completing various revolutionary tasks. Only by being infinitely loyal to the people and to the revolution, and infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, can one possess high organizational discipline like Qiu Shaochun.

On the eve of national liberation, Chairman Mao issued a great call to the People's Liberation Army: "The army advances, production increases by an inch, discipline is strengthened, and the revolution is invincible." The People's Liberation Army resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great call and finally won the victory of the national revolution. This fact fully illustrates the great importance of "strengthening discipline" to the success or failure of the revolutionary cause!

Red Guards comrades, we are all armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We must always encourage, learn from, support, and rely on each other. Let us join hands, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Like Qiu Shaochun, let us temper ourselves into proletarian revolutionary fighters with high political awareness and organizational discipline.

### 加强纪律性　革命无不胜前

    加强纪律性　革命无不胜前
    志愿军一级战斗英雄邱少云烈士的弟弟  四川省铜梁县少云公社少云大队民兵连长  邱少全
    红卫兵同志们，这些日子来，你们按照毛主席指引的方向，挥舞着革命的千钧棒，大破“四旧”，大立“四新”，取得了辉煌的成绩。一切革命的人都为你们的成就而欢欣鼓舞。我们以有你们这样的革命闯将而感到自豪！
    红卫兵和我们民兵，都是解放军的后备力量。我们要把自己的队伍建设得更加革命化，最重要的一条，就是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，像人民解放军那样，做毛主席的好战士。
    解放军值得我们学习的东西很多。我们民兵连在近年来的实践中体会到，解放军高度自觉的组织性和纪律性，是我们需要努力学习的一个极为重要的方面。
    我的哥哥，前中国人民志愿军一级战斗英雄，伟大的国际主义战士邱少云，就是一个最自觉地执行革命纪律的模范。他是在执行一次敌前潜伏任务的时候牺牲的。当时，一颗燃烧弹落在离他两米远的地方，他身上着火了。尽管身后就是一条水沟，只要往后退几步，在泥水里滚一滚，就可以把火扑灭，但他没有这样做。因为他知道，如果这样做，就可能发出声音，被敌人发觉，使革命受到损失。他牢记毛主席的教导：“这个军队之所以有力量，是因为所有参加这个军队的人，都具有自觉的纪律；他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。”我的哥哥为了不影响整个潜伏分队五百多战友的生命安全，影响整个战斗的胜利，他就像铁人一样，一动不动地卧在地上，忍受着难以想像的肉体痛苦，让烈火在全身燃烧，最后光荣牺牲，保证整个分队胜利地完成了敌前潜伏任务，赢得了战斗的胜利。
    邱少云烈士的这种高度组织纪律性，是从哪里来的呢？它是由高度的无产阶级政治觉悟凝结成的，是他忠实地认真地执行毛主席的“以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”教导的结果。一句话，是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果。
    我们民兵连近年来一直把学习邱少云烈士严格遵守组织纪律的优良品质，列为一项重要内容，在生产劳动中注意严守生产纪律，处处维护人民利益；在困难面前听从指挥，响应号召，啃硬骨头。有一次，我们参加一项农田基本建设工程，突然发现一块大石头正要往下滚，站在岩边的民兵有被打下去的危险。在这紧急关头，民兵张华政冒着生命的危险，冲上去用自己的身体顶住那块巨石，防止了事故，群众称赞他是“活着的王杰”。
    我们民兵连在学习邱少云烈士的过程中深刻认识到，高度的组织性和纪律性，是建设一支革命队伍，胜利完成各项革命任务的基本保证。而只有对人民、对革命无限忠心，对毛泽东思想无限忠心，才可能具有像邱少云烈士那样的高度组织性和纪律性。
    毛主席在全国解放前夕，曾经向人民解放军发出伟大号召：“军队向前进，生产长一寸，加强纪律性，革命无不胜。”人民解放军坚决地执行了毛主席的这个伟大号召，终于取得了全国革命的胜利。这个事实，充分说明“加强纪律性”对于革命事业的成败具有何等重大的作用！
    红卫兵同志们，我们都是用毛泽东思想武装起来的队伍，我们要永远互相鼓舞、互相学习、互相支持、互相信赖。让我们携起手来，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力活学活用毛主席著作，像邱少云那样，把自己锻炼成为一个具有高度政治觉悟和组织纪律性的无产阶级革命战士。
