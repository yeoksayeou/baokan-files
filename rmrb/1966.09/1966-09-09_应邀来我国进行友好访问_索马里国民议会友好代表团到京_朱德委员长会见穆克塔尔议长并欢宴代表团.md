		and African peoples in their anti-imperialist struggle.

		Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's
		Congress Kang Sheng, Guo Moruo, Yang Mingxuan, and Liu Ningyi, and Vice

		In his speech, Chairman Ju De praised the efforts made by the people of
		Somalia in consolidating national independence and building their
		country since the establishment of the Somali Republic.

		Chairman Ju De said that the friendship between the Chinese and Somali
		peoples was forged in the common struggle against imperialism and
		colonialism. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between
		China and Somalia, friendly relations between the two countries have
		continued to develop. He said that the visit of the Somali National
		Assembly Friendship Delegation to China will certainly make a
		beneficial contribution to increasing mutual understanding and
		friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

		Chairman Ju De pointed out that imperialism and old and new colonialism,
		led by the United States, are still engaged in control, interference,
		subversion, and aggression everywhere. He condemned the U.S.
		imperialism's expansion of aggression in Vietnam while playing the
		"bombing for peace" trick. He said that the aggressive nature of
		imperialism and old and new colonialism will not change, and the Asian
		and African peoples must continue to be vigilant, strengthen unity, and
		engage in a struggle on equal terms.

		He said, "Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out: 'The oppressed peoples and
		nations must not rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running
		dogs for their liberation, but only through strengthening unity and
		persisting in struggle can they achieve victory.' Chairman Ju De said
		that the power of the people is invincible. As long as the Asian and
		African peoples, and the peoples of the world unite, dare to fight,
		overcome difficulties, and advance bravely, they will surely be able
		to bury imperialism and colonialism completely.

		Chairman Sheikh Mukhtar said in his speech that he brought the
		fraternal greetings of the Somali people. The Somali people greatly
		admire the great history of the Chinese people and their heroic
		struggle for dignity, progress, and prosperity.

		He said that the People's Republic of China has always worked to
		strengthen friendly relations with the entire African continent. The
		Chinese people, like the African people, have suffered from the
		disasters and pain brought by imperialism. The Somali people have
		always paid close attention to the anti-imperialist struggle of the
		Chinese people.

		He said that since its independence, Somalia has signed friendship and
		cooperation agreements with various Asian and African countries. The
		People's Republic of China has supported us in various ways on every
		occasion.

		The Chairman talked about accepting foreign aid in national
		construction, saying that the best aid, without any political
		motives, is the aid that the People's Republic of China has given us
		in various aspects. He also praised the work done by a group of
		Chinese doctors currently in Somalia. He said that we hope to continue
		this cooperation, and we believe that the People's Republic of China
		will always stand by our side.

		The Chairman concluded by wishing for the everlasting friendship and
		cooperation between Somalia and China, and long life to the great
		leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong.
