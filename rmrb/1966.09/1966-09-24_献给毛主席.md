		Dedicated to Chairman Mao
		An Indonesian Middle School Teacher

	I have read Chairman Mao Zedong's poetry, and I have written a poem to dedicate to Chairman Mao Zedong.

	Your name will forever be etched in my heart,
	Giving me inspiration and the strength to fight.
	Your books and theories,
	Have become the weapons of workers, peasants, and artists.
	The path you have walked is also the path we must take.
	Your skies are filled with red clouds.
	But on our land, demons still dance wildly,
	Workers have no freedom of speech,
	Peasants gasp under the oppression of evil.
	To welcome the dawn of a new day,
	We bravely fight, one after another;
	Though our journey is long,
	Our ideals will surely be realized.
	From Beijing, your red poetry collection was sent,
	It spreads like a spring breeze across Indonesia.
	The people of Indonesia salute you,
	We will hold high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism,
	Marching forward forever, until victory.

    献给毛主席
    印度尼西亚一中学教师
    我阅读了毛泽东主席诗词后，写了一首诗，献给毛泽东主席。
    您的名字永远铭记在我心里，
    给了我鼓舞和战斗力。
    您的书和理论，
    成了工人、农民和艺术家的武器。
    您走过的路，也是我们要走的路。
    你们的天空红霞万朵。
    而我们的土地上还是群魔乱舞，
    工人没有言论自由，
    农民在恶魔压榨下喘息。
    为了迎接黎明的曙光，
    英勇战斗，前赴后继；
    我们的道路尽管漫长，
    我们的理想一定实现。
    从北京寄来了，
    您那红色的诗集，
    它像春风一样传遍印尼各地。
    印尼人民向您致意，
    我们要高举马列主义红旗，
    永远前进，直至胜利。
