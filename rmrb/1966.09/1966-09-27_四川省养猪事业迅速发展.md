The pig-raising industry in the rural areas of Sichuan Province has developed rapidly. Up to now, the total number of pigs in the province has reached more than 27 million, surpassing the highest level in history. Sixteen counties have already reached the targets set by the national agricultural development plan for the number of pigs.

With more pigs, there is more manure. This year, the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland in the province has generally increased by more than one-third compared to last year. With the increase in fertilizer application, the yield per unit area of grain and economic crops has also increased. Both collective and individual incomes have risen. In Shifang County, where pig-raising is relatively common, each household averages more than 100 yuan in income from pig-raising annually.

    四川省养猪事业迅速发展
    四川省农村养猪事业迅速发展，到目前为止，全省存栏的猪已达二千七百多万头，超过了历史上的最高水平。有十六个县的养猪头数已经达到了全国农业发展纲要规定的指标。
    猪多，肥多。今年全省农田施肥量，一般都比去年增加三分之一以上。随着施肥量的增加，粮食和经济作物的单位面积产量也得到提高。集体和社员的收入也增加了。养猪较多的什邡县，按户平均每年养猪收入都在一百元以上。
