Workers, peasants, and soldiers amateur art warriors will participate in the National Day performances this year, presenting themselves as the new masters of proletarian culture in the capital's artistic stage. This is a new victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led and initiated by Chairman Mao.

The Daqing Oilfield workers and their families' amateur performance team and the peasant amateur performance team composed of poor and lower-middle peasants from Hebei Province have already arrived in Beijing. Workers and commune members who participated in the "Summer in Harbin" music festival will soon come to Beijing for performances. They will join the amateur performance teams of the PLA units stationed in Beijing, some Red Guards in the capital, and revolutionary cultural workers from Beijing and other places. Through a variety of colorful artistic programs, they will express their firm resolve to be forever loyal to the Party and to the beloved leader Chairman Mao, and their revolutionary determination to be the masters of new proletarian culture.

Also coming to the capital to participate in this year's National Day performances are the famous Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Red Horse Troupe and the cultural work team of the PLA Guangzhou Navy. The Wuhan City Acrobatic Troupe will also come to Beijing for performances.

Currently, the workers, peasants, and soldiers amateur performers who have already arrived in Beijing are striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, widely soliciting opinions from the workers, peasants, and Red Guards, and repeatedly revising and improving their artistic programs to further improve the performance quality.
