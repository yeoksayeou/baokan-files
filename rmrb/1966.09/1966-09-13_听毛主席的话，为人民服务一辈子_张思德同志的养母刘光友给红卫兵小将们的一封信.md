Red Guards,

The brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune," written by Chairman Mao after my son Zhang Sided's martyrdom, has been published for twenty-two years. I have studied this article countless times, and each time I study it, it gives me more confidence and strength, inspiring me to serve the people like Sided. Therefore, the more I study, the better my spirit becomes, and the more I feel that Chairman Mao is wise and great. With my deepest love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, I have recently been studying this article over and over again, and I have been greatly inspired and deeply educated, feeling especially close to it. I read Chairman Mao's books, and although I am seventy-two years old, I do not feel old. If I do not read Chairman Mao's books for a day, I feel uncomfortable. I cannot express in a thousand words or a thousand sentences my love for Chairman Mao. All my words come down to one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!

The article "In Memory of Norman Bethune" teaches us to revolutionize for life, to have the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. Every revolutionary comrade, whether a community member, a cadre, a worker, a soldier, a youth, or an elder, should repeatedly study and apply this article, firmly establishing a worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people. In this way, our revolutionary cause will prosper, and we will be able to overcome all difficulties and successfully complete all tasks.

Over the past twenty-two years, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of serving the people, many comrades, like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Liu Yingjun, have been Chairman Mao's good soldiers, just like my son Sided, dedicating themselves to the revolution and the people, making the revolutionary cause develop victoriously under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. Although Sided has sacrificed his life, he completely and thoroughly served the people for life, dying heavier than Mount Tai. This is entirely the result of the Party and Chairman Mao's teachings. I remember when I sent Sided to join the Red Army, he was only eighteen years old, a child not as tall as a hoe handle, and did not understand much. After joining the Red Army, he listened carefully to Chairman Mao's words, understood the principles of fighting for the liberation of the poor, and in the revolutionary ranks, he was fearless of hardship and death, wholeheartedly serving the people, becoming a model for everyone to learn from.

Chairman Mao's words are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow the old world and build a new world. I have lived for seventy-two years, experienced several dynasties, and every feudal ruler was a big villain who ate human flesh and drank human blood. In 1932, after my son joined the Red Army, my family was raided by the reactionaries, and we had to go to the hills to dig wild vegetables to live. Chairman Mao led the laboring people to revolt, and after a long struggle, we finally gained complete liberation and lived a happy life. Chairman Mao is the great savior of the laboring people, and Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible powerful ideological weapon. We use this weapon to overthrow the old world and also use this weapon to criticize all ghosts and demons and the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. Once the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will become an irresistible force to smash the "Four Olds." Currently, revolutionary youth have established the Red Guards and other revolutionary organizations, and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have become vanguards and achieved merits. All ghosts and demons, all reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and harmful elements will be fought down, fought over, and fought to stink. Red Guards, you have done well! You are right! I also want to join you in smashing the "Four Olds" and establishing the "Four News." You should read Chairman Mao's books like my son Sided, listen to Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly serve the people, and revolutionize for life, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist revolution to the end!

This year, in our hometown—Yilong County Six Harmony Commune—there was a drought for more than a hundred days. However, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we were not afraid of difficulties and overcame natural disasters, achieving a bumper harvest of grain and increased cotton production. At this moment of great harvest, everyone said that this year's increase in production is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of our revolutionary people, the red sun that never sets in our hearts. Although I am old, my heart is not old. I will still read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and like Sided, revolutionize for life and serve the people for life. Red Guards, you should all be good students and good soldiers of Chairman Mao. In the struggle, you must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking Chairman Mao's books as the guiding principle for all our work. You should learn from the PLA, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, wholeheartedly serve the people, and observe the three disciplines and eight points of attention. You should strive to study the Sixteen Points, be familiar with the Sixteen Points, master the Sixteen Points, and apply the Sixteen Points. You should use cultural struggle, not physical struggle, and not hit people. Believe that cultural struggle will definitely fight down, fight over, and fight to stink all ghosts and demons. Keep Chairman Mao's words forever in your heart and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life.

Finally, let us shout:

Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!

    听毛主席的话，为人民服务一辈子
    ——张思德同志的养母刘光友给红卫兵小将们的一封信
    红卫兵小将们：
    《为人民服务》这篇光辉的著作，是毛主席在我儿子张思德牺牲后，在追悼会上的讲话，到现在已经发表二十二周年了。这篇文章我学了多少次，每学一次，都给我增添了信心和力量，鼓舞着我要像思德那样为人民服务，所以我越学精神越好，越学越觉得毛主席英明伟大。我怀着对毛主席最热爱、最信仰、最崇拜的心情，近来又翻来复去地学习了这篇文章，受到了极大的鼓舞，深刻的教育，感到格外亲切。我读了毛主席的书，尽管我今年已七十二岁了，但并不感觉老。我一天不读毛主席的书，就觉得心里不舒服。千言万语，表达不了我对毛主席的热爱，千句万句汇成一句：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    《为人民服务》这篇文章，教育我们要一辈子革命，要有全心全意为人民服务的精神。每个革命同志，无论是社员，还是干部，无论是工人，还是解放军，也无论是青年，还是老年，都应该反复学习、反复用这篇文章，牢固地树立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的世界观。这样，我们的革命事业就会兴旺起来，我们就能战胜一切困难，胜利地完成各项工作任务。
    二十二年来，在毛主席为人民服务的光辉思想教育下，许许多多的同志，像雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄、刘英俊等，他们都是毛主席的好战士，和我儿子思德一样，一心为革命，一心为人民，使革命事业在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下胜利地向前发展。思德虽然牺牲了，但他“完全”、“彻底”地为人民服务了一辈子，死得比泰山还重，这完全是党和毛主席教导的结果。记得我送思德参加红军时，他才十八岁，是一个没有锄把高的娃娃，还不大懂事。他参加红军后，认真听毛主席的话，懂得了为穷人翻身求解放的道理，在革命队伍里，不怕苦、不怕死，全心全意为人民服务，才成为大家学习的榜样。
    毛主席的话，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。我们就是靠毛泽东思想，推翻旧世界，建立新世界。我活了七十二岁，经过了几个朝代，封建统治者，哪一个不是吃人肉、喝人血的大坏蛋。一九三二年，我儿子参加红军后，我家被反动派抄了，只好到坡上去挖野菜过日子。毛主席领导劳动人民起来闹革命，经过长期斗争，我们才彻底获得解放，过上幸福的日子。毛主席是我们劳动人民的大救星，毛泽东思想是战无不胜的强大思想武器。我们用这一武器，推翻了旧世界，也要用这一武器，批判一切牛鬼蛇神和剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯；人民群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就会变成大破“四旧”的不可抗拒的力量。目前革命青少年们成立了红卫兵和其他革命组织，在无产阶级文化大革命中，当了闯将，立了功劳，一切牛鬼蛇神，一切资产阶级反动“权威”、害人虫，都要被我们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。红卫兵小将们，你们干得好！干得对！我也要和你们一起，大破“四旧”、大立“四新”。你们应该像我儿子思德那样，好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，全心全意为人民服务，干一辈子革命，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底！
    今年我们家乡——仪陇县六合公社出现了一百多天的干旱。但在毛泽东思想的教育下，我们不怕困难，战胜了自然灾害，粮食丰收，棉花增产。在大庆丰收的时刻，大家都说今年增产，是毛泽东思想的胜利。毛泽东思想是我们革命人民的命根子，是我们心中永远不落的红太阳。我虽然已经老了，但我的心老不了，我还要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，像思德那样，革命一辈子，为人民服务一辈子。红卫兵小将们，你们都要做毛主席的好学生、好战士，在斗争中，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把毛主席的书，作为我们一切工作的指导方针。你们要学习解放军，活学活用毛主席著作，全心全意为人民服务，遵守三大纪律八项注意。你们要努力学习十六条、熟悉十六条、掌握十六条、运用十六条。要用文斗，不要武斗，不要动手打人，坚信文斗一定能把一切牛鬼蛇神斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。把毛主席的话永远记在心里，跟随毛主席干一辈子革命。
    最后让我们高呼：
    毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
