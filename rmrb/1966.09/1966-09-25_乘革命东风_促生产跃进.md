Edition: 3

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have insisted on placing the study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all our work. We study in the midst of struggle and apply what we learn in the midst of struggle, studying earnestly and applying earnestly, resolutely using Mao Zedong Thought to guide our revolution and production. The class consciousness of the broad masses of workers has reached an unprecedented height, and revolutionary spirit has soared to new heights. Due to the profound changes in our spiritual outlook, both production and scientific experiments have entered a new phase of leapfrog development. Our warehouse storage capacity has significantly increased, and management costs have been markedly reduced.

This year is the first year of our country's third five-year plan. We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, ride the east wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must firmly hold our production posts, grasp revolution with one hand and production with the other, be the main force of the cultural revolution, and be the shock troops of the production struggle.

    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们坚持把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，认真地学，认真地用，坚决用毛泽东思想去指导革命，指导生产。广大职工的阶级觉悟空前提高，革命精神空前高涨。由于精神面貌发生了深刻变化，在生产和科学实验上都出现了一个新的跃进局面。我们的仓库储存量大幅度提高，保管费用显著降低。
    今年是我国进行第三个五年计划的第一年。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，乘无产阶级文化大革命的东风，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，坚守生产岗位，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，当好文化大革命的主力军，当好生产斗争的突击队。
