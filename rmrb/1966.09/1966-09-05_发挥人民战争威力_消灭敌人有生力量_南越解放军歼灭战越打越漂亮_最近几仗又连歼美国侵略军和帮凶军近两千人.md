	According to Western news agencies, on the night of September 3, while the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division was "celebrating" its one-year anniversary of invading South Vietnam at the An Khe base, it was subjected to a fierce bombardment by the Liberation Army of South Vietnam. A U.S. military spokesman in Saigon admitted on September 4 that some U.S. aggressor troops were killed or wounded on the spot, and a batch of planes were also destroyed by the Liberation Army's artillery fire.

	Hanoi, September 4 (Xinhua) According to a report from the Liberation Communication Agency of South Vietnam: The liberation armed forces of Ba Ria Province in South Vietnam annihilated more than 700 Australian lackey troops on August 17 and 18.

	At dawn on August 17, the liberation armed forces bombarded the Thua Mountain military base, annihilating more than 100 Australian lackey troops.

	On August 18, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce attack on an Australian lackey regiment and an armored car battalion in the Long Thanh Township of Chau Doc County. After a three-hour intense battle, they almost completely annihilated this enemy force, killing or wounding more than 600, destroying three M-113 and M-118 type armored cars, shooting down one F-105 jet, and seizing a large amount of weapons and ammunition.

	The battle began at 3:20 p.m. that afternoon. Liberation Army soldiers quickly moved in from all directions, surrounding the enemy and launching an assault. After an hour of fighting, the liberation armed forces completely annihilated the two enemy companies on the right flank. The remaining enemy retreated, attempting to defend themselves in the tin-roofed residential area. Just as the Australian troops were in a desperate situation, the New Zealand lackey artillery, in a panic, fired shells directly at the Australian troops, killing and wounding some of them.

	The brave soldiers of the Liberation Army decided to end the battle victoriously before nightfall and concentrated their firepower for a final fierce assault. They charged straight into the enemy ranks, annihilating almost all the Australian lackey troops.
