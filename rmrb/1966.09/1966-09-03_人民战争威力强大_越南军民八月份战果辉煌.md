The brave and skilled military and civilians of North Vietnam continued to demonstrate the mighty power of people's war in August, shattering the "air superiority" of the American aggressors and achieving new glorious victories: they shot down 105 American modern aircraft of various types and damaged many more, while also capturing a large number of American air pirates.

August was a month in which the American aggressors continued to increase their troops in South Vietnam and escalate their bombing of North Vietnam.

Facing the American aggressors' frenzied war actions, the military and civilians of North Vietnam showed unyielding spirit. The air defense units, militia self-defense corps, and the people's air force and navy worked closely together, setting up a sky full of fire nets across North Vietnam, almost daily shattering the brazen attacks of hundreds of American aggressor aircraft and delivering severe punishment to the enemy planes.

In this month, the North Vietnamese militia, with rich experience in shooting down American planes, fully utilized the human factor, continuously using rifles and machine guns to shoot down five American jet planes.

	According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians of South Vietnam responded to the great battle call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, launching fierce attacks on the enemy in August, annihilating over 7,400 enemy troops, including 4,671 American invaders and their lackeys. They also destroyed or damaged 154 enemy vehicles and shot down or damaged 47 enemy aircraft of various types.

	During this month, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces fought extremely bravely. Apart from proactively attacking some bases and strongholds of the American puppet forces and their lackeys, they also continuously ambushed and intercepted enemy reinforcements, dealing heavy blows to the enemy. The liberation armed forces in Ba Dinh Province, in a single ambush battle in Long Thanh Commune, Zhu De County, annihilated nearly a battalion of Australian lackeys.

	The liberation armed forces also continuously lured out the American invaders to fight. For example, in the Gui Shan-San Qi area of Quang Nam Province, the liberation armed forces annihilated 1,500 American puppet troops, destroyed or damaged more than 20 enemy aircraft, and damaged more than 10 enemy vehicles.

	In August, local troops and guerrillas in various places worked closely with the liberation army to proactively attack enemy supply lines, annihilating a large number of enemies. On the first, fourth, ninth, fifteenth, and twentieth highways, a series of enemy strongholds were captured or forced to retreat by local troops and guerrillas, with puppet army battalions being annihilated in the tens. On various waterways, the liberation armed forces also sank and damaged many enemy warships and motorboats.

    人民战争威力强大
    越南军民八月份战果辉煌
    北方：击落美机百余架
    南方：歼灭敌军七千多
    据新华社河内二日电　本社记者报道：英勇善战的越南北方军民，在八月份继续发挥人民战争的强大威力，粉碎美国强盗的“空中优势”，又取得了新的光辉战绩：打落美国各种现代化飞机一百零五架，打伤多架，同时活捉了大批美国飞贼。
    八月份，是美国强盗继续向越南南方增兵，并继续扩大对越南北方轰炸的一个月。
    面对着美国强盗疯狂的战争行动，越南北方军民表现了坚强不屈的大无畏精神。防空部队、民兵自卫队和人民空军、海军，密切配合作战，在越南北方布下了满天火网，几乎每天都粉碎成百架次美国强盗飞机的猖狂进攻，给敌机以严厉惩罚。
    在这个月里，具有打美国飞机丰富经验的越南北方民兵，高度发挥人的因素，连续用步枪和机枪击落美国喷气式飞机五架。
    新华社河内一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方军民响应胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召，八月份接连猛烈进攻敌人，共歼敌七千四百多名，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军四千六百七十一名，击毁和击伤各种军车一百五十四辆，击毁和击落各种敌机四十七架。
    在这个月中，越南南方解放武装力量战斗得十分英勇，除了主动袭击美伪军以及帮凶军的一些基地和据点外，还不断地伏击和截击敌人的援军，给敌人以沉重打击。巴地省解放武装力量仅在珠德县隆新乡的一次伏击战中，就消灭澳大利亚帮凶军近一个营。
    解放武装力量还不断把美国侵略者诱出来打。如在广南省桂山—三岐地区解放武装力量就这样消灭美伪军一千五百名，击毁和击落敌机二十多架，击伤军车十多辆等。
    八月份，各地地方部队和游击队，同解放军紧密配合，主动袭击敌人的交通线，消灭大量敌人。在第一号、第四号、第九号、第十五号和第二十号公路上，一系列的敌军据点都被地方部队和游击队攻克或强迫撤退，伪军有成十个连被消灭。在各条水路交通线上，解放武装力量也击沉和击伤敌人许多战船和汽艇。
