Chairman Mao's great thought of "serving the people" has illuminated the textile industry.

The 1.5 million textile workers across the country have used Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, thoroughly criticized capitalist management ideas, broken through the barriers set by bourgeois "authorities," and raised the production of textiles to a new level.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 5th, after the 1.5 million textile workers grasped Chairman Mao's great thought of "serving the people," it has been transformed into a tremendous material force driving production and technological development.

In the recent great revolutionary movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the broad masses of textile workers in our country have stood taller and seen farther. They have taken it upon themselves to solve the clothing needs of 700 million people, regarding Chairman Mao's teachings on "serving the people" as the guiding principle for all their work and as a powerful weapon in their struggle. They have fiercely attacked various capitalist and revisionist management and technical ideas within the textile industry system, bravely breaking through the numerous obstacles set by bourgeois "experts" and "authorities," and pushing the quantity, quality, and variety of textiles in our country to a new level.

The production efficiency of our country's textile industry, as measured by the most important indicator of the average output per thousand spindles of fine yarn, has maintained a world-advanced level in recent years: for 20-count yarn, the average output per unit in 1965 was 30 kilograms, an increase of 70% compared to 1949. Can this high level be further improved? Some bourgeois "experts" have come forward to say: there is not much potential left to tap! They fear "chaos" and "disruption," emphasizing the "stability" of production order, the "reasonable speed" of machines, and the material factors. However, the broad masses of textile workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings on "serving the people," have criticized the erroneous ideas of these bourgeois "experts" of "seeing things but not people," broken through the constraints, implemented technological and operational innovations, and continuously increased the output per thousand spindles of fine yarn. Currently, the output in general old factories has risen to 32-33 kilograms, with some reaching over 35 kilograms.

Historical issues such as the reddening of indigo-dyed cloth, the shedding of flannel, high shrinkage rates, poor colorfastness, and easy brittleness of some textiles have been significantly improved under the illumination of Chairman Mao's thought of "serving the people."

Regarding such textile quality issues that affect the immediate interests of the working people to a certain extent, bourgeois technical "experts" and "authorities" have adopted an aristocratic attitude. They believe that these "low-grade" products are bound to have defects and are not worth spending effort on. The broad masses of textile workers, armed with Chairman Mao's thought of "serving the people," firmly oppose this view. They believe: capitalist textile enterprises, guided by profit, can disclaim responsibility for issues like "shrinkage, brittleness, fading, and shedding"; our socialist enterprises, however, must establish high standards and strict requirements, taking full responsibility to the people!

To reduce the shrinkage rate of fabrics will have some impact on the production cost and profit of the enterprise. How to deal with this problem? Since last year, textile industry workers in Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanghai, Hebei, and other places have studied and applied Chairman Mao's instructions on completely and thoroughly serving the people, resolutely opposing capitalist management ideas, and choosing to reduce some of the factory's profits. They have taken various effective measures to strive to reduce the shrinkage rate of some dyed fabrics.

Currently, the shrinkage rate of dyed fabrics in our country, after pre-shrinkage treatment, has been reduced from the original 10% or so to within 4%; the shrinkage rate of satin and khaki has also reached the national standard.

In 1964, weavers in our country launched a fierce attack on the old practice of weavers being able to unravel and re-weave the weft yarn when the fabric is damaged, gradually implementing a revolutionary measure to ensure that the fabric woven out is not unraveled, not repaired, not washed, and inside and outside are the same. The broad masses of weavers have "kept the revolution in mind and woven their hearts into the fabric," striving to eliminate "defective fabrics" before they are woven out. This revolutionary action by the broad masses of weavers has significantly improved the actual quality level of cotton fabrics in our country.

Under the guidance of the thought of completely and thoroughly serving the people, textile industry departments across the country have increased the production of thick, durable, and inexpensive textiles for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In 1965, the production of six types of cotton fabrics most loved by the broad laboring people—coarse cloth, 190-count denim, yarn twill, floral twill, floral gabardine, and corduroy—was the highest in the history of New China; this year's production in the first half of the year has also increased significantly compared to last year. Farmers love dyed fabrics, which were generally woven with stock yarn in the past, costing 8-9 jiao or even over 1 yuan per meter, and were not durable. Some cotton mills in Jiangsu, Shanxi, and Sichuan, based on the opinions of farmers, have produced a type of coarse yarn dyed fabric with a thick feel, high durability, good color matching, and a price of only 4-5 jiao per meter, which has been warmly welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Special textile products and imitation products designed for the broad laboring people are also becoming increasingly rich. In the past, thick sweaters were mainly made in the style of buttoned collars, which were inconvenient for farmers to wear while working; now, printed, lapel, and collar sweaters, sweater vests, wide-leg and wide-crotch pants, and pant leg covers have been designed, all considering the actual needs of farmers working in the fields. To relieve the pain of farmers in rice-growing areas being bitten by leeches, a sock factory in Zhejiang has successfully trial-produced socks made of polyvinyl chloride long fiber that can prevent leeches. Towel industry workers, based on rural customs, have specially produced a type of towel for rural areas that is inexpensive, durable, and can be used for washing the face, wrapping the head, wrapping the neck, and covering the basket, among other uses. The design of textile patterns has also made achievements in facing the needs of 500 million farmers.

Under the inspiration and encouragement of Chairman Mao's great thought of "serving the people," the broad masses of textile workers dare to think and act, actively create, and strive to explore new fields, develop new materials, adopt new technologies, conduct new designs, and develop many new products, making the textile market in our country more prosperous year by year. Our country has established a number of viscose fiber and synthetic fiber enterprises, producing viscose fiber, vinylon, and nylon in batches. Recently, a new type of synthetic fiber, vinylon, has been successfully developed, which has good performance, is inexpensive, and is very suitable for laboring people to wear. Natural fibers such as cassava silk cocoons and oak silk cocoons have also seen significant development in recent years.

Some representatives of the bourgeoisie in the textile industry claim that they developed textiles relying on "two types of yarn" (cotton and polyester, wool and polyester) and "four firsts" (technology first, materials first, books first, conditions first). The broad masses of textile workers in our country have refuted this fallacy with countless facts. The broad masses of textile workers point out: all the achievements of our country's textile products are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought! A small handful of representatives of the bourgeoisie oppose Mao Zedong Thought, which only exposes their treacherous, anti-party, and anti-socialist revolutionary faces.

### 把革命记在心里　把红心织在布上  毛主席“为人民”的伟大思想照红了纺织工业

    把革命记在心里　把红心织在布上
    毛主席“为人民”的伟大思想照红了纺织工业
    全国一百五十万纺织职工用毛泽东思想为武器，大破资本主义经营思想，冲破资产阶级“权威”阻拦，把纺织品生产提高到新水平。
    据新华社五日讯　毛主席“为人民服务”的伟大思想为一百五十万纺织职工所掌握之后，已经转化为推动生产和技术发展的巨大物质力量。
    在近几年活学活用毛主席著作的伟大革命运动中，我国广大纺织职工站得更高，看得更远。他们以解决七亿人民的穿衣问题为己任，把毛主席“为人民服务”的教导，作为一切工作的指导方针，作为强大的战斗武器，猛烈冲击纺织工业系统中形形色色的资本主义、修正主义的经营思想和技术思想，勇敢冲破资产阶级“专家”、“权威”的种种阻拦，把我国纺织品的数量质量和花色品种推进到了一个新的水平。
    我国纺织工业的生产效率，以棉纺的细纱千锭时产量这个最重要的标志来衡量，最近几年一直保持着世界先进水平：折合二十支纱，一九六五年平均单位产量为三十公斤，比一九四九年提高百分之七十。这样高的水平，还能不能进一步提高？有些资产阶级“专家”站出来说：没有多大潜力可挖了！他们怕“乱”、怕“破”，片面强调生产秩序的“稳定”，片面强调机器的“合理车速”，片面强调物的因素。但是，广大纺织职工遵照毛主席“为人民服务”的教导，批判了那些资产阶级“专家”的“见物不见人”的错误思想，打破框框，实行技术革新和操作革新，使细纱千锭时产量一再提高，目前一般老厂已上升到三十二三公斤，高的达三十五公斤以上。
    历史遗留下来的一批“老、大、难”的质量问题，如凡拉明蓝布泛红，灯芯绒容易脱绒，部分纺织品缩水率较高、染色牢度较差、容易发脆等等，在毛主席“为人民服务”的光辉思想照耀下，现在都已经显著改善了。
    对于这样一些在一定程度上影响劳动人民切身利益的纺织品质量问题，资产阶级技术“专家”、“权威”抱着贵族老爷式的态度。他们认为这些“低档”产品免不了有缺点，不值得在上面花功夫。用毛主席“为人民”的思想武装起来的广大纺织职工，坚决反对这种看法。他们认为：资本主义纺织企业，实行利润挂帅，对于“缩、脆、褪、脱”等质量问题，可以概不负责；我们社会主义企业，则一定要树立高标准、严要求，对人民负责到底！
    要把织物缩水率降下来，对企业的生产成本和利润会有一些影响。怎样对待这个问题？去年以来，江苏、辽宁、山东、上海、河北等地的纺织工业部门职工，带着问题活学活用了毛主席完全、彻底为人民服务的指示，坚决反对资本主义经营思想，宁愿工厂减少些利润，坚持采取各种有效措施，努力把部分色织布的缩水率降下来。　
    目前，我国色织布的缩水率，经过预缩处理，已经从原来的百分之十左右，下降到百分之四以内；府绸、卡其的缩水率，也达到了国家规定的标准。
    一九六四年，我国织布工人向布织坏了可以把纬纱拆去重织的旧习惯勇猛开火，逐步实现了一项革命措施，要求做到织出来的布，不拆、不修、不洗，表里如一。广大织布工人“把革命记在心上，把心织在布上”，努力把“坏布”消灭在织出来之前。广大织布工人的这一革命行动使我国棉布的实际质量水平大大提高了一步。
    在完全、彻底为人民服务的思想指导下，各地纺织工业部门面向广大工农兵群众的厚实、经穿、价廉的纺织品大幅度增产。一九六五年生产的粗布、一九○号士林蓝布、纱卡其、花哔叽、花贡呢、灯芯绒等六种广大劳动人民最喜爱的棉布，是新中国建立以来最多的一年；今年上半年比去年又有较多的增产。农民很喜爱的色织布，过去一般都用合股线织，一尺布得八九角钱甚至一元以上，还不耐磨。江苏、山西、四川等地的一些棉织厂，根据农民的意见，“粗粮细作”，生产了一种粗支单纱的色织布，手感厚实，很耐磨，配色也好，每尺布仅四五角钱，受到贫下中农的热烈欢迎。
    专门为广大劳动人民设计的针织品、复制产品，也日益丰富。以前，厚绒衫主要是螺纹口套式的，农民劳动时穿着不方便；现在设计出印花、大襟、翻领厚绒衫，绒背心，大袴、大裤口、开叉的绒裤和绒裤脚套等等，都考虑了农民下地劳动的实际需要。为了解除水稻区农民被蚂蝗叮的痛苦，浙江一家袜厂试制成功了聚氯乙稀长丝织造的防蚂蝗袜。毛巾行业的职工根据农村的习惯，专门为农村生产了一种价廉、耐用，既能洗脸，又能包头、围颈、罩篮头等多种用途的毛巾。纺织品的图案设计，在面向五亿农民方面也作出了成绩。
    在毛主席“为人民服务”的伟大思想鼓舞和激励下，广大纺织职工敢想敢干，积极创造，努力探索新领域，发展新原料，采用新工艺，进行新设计，发展了许多新产品，使我国纺织品市场一年比一年更繁荣。我国已经建立起一批粘胶纤维、合成纤维企业，成批生产粘胶纤维、维纶、锦纶等多种化学纤维。最近，又创制成功一种新型合成纤维维氯纶，性能好，价钱便宜，十分适合劳动人民穿着。天然纤维木薯蚕茧、柞蚕茧等，近几年也有很大发展。
    纺织行业的一些资产阶级代表人物，说什么他们发展纺织品是靠“两纶”（棉涤纶、毛涤纶）起家，靠“四个第一”（技术第一、资料第一、书本第一、条件第一）挂帅。我国广大纺织职工用无数事实给这种谬论以迎头痛击。广大纺织职工指出：我国纺织产品的一切成就，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！一小撮资产阶级代表人物反对毛泽东思想，只能暴露他们反党、反社会主义的反革命丑恶嘴脸。
