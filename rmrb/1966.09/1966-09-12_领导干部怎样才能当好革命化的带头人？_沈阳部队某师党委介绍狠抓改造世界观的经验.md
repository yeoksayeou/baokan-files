How can cadres sincerely listen to Chairman Mao's words, thoroughly transform their worldview, and become revolutionary leaders in the army? At a recent conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works held by the People's Liberation Army Shenyang Military Region, the Party Committee of a certain division introduced their experience: Party Committee members must never forget class struggle, raise the awareness and urgency of transforming their worldview; they must also "open the door," reveal their thoughts to the masses, accept criticism from the masses, and rely on the masses for supervision, in order to become revolutionary leaders.

Re-evaluating oneself to escape from blind self-satisfaction

This division's Party Committee responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call in 1960 to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and vigorously promoted the study of Chairman Mao's works. As cadres studied more, so did the soldiers, and all work was done well. During the study, Party Committee members gradually realized that studying Chairman Mao's works required a focus on "application" and a thorough transformation of one's worldview. Previously, some of them thought they had a solid foundation and deep roots, being "poor children" and "little guerrillas" who had fought alongside Chairman Mao for decades, passing through the test of war, and having no political problems. Unconsciously, they excluded themselves from the circle of ideological transformation and prevention of "peaceful evolution." Chairman Mao said: "The situation is constantly changing. To make one's thoughts adapt to new situations, one must study. Even those who have a relatively good understanding of Marxism and have a firm proletarian stance must still study, accept new things, and research new problems." He also said: "In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to be transformed." Chairman Mao's teachings liberated them from blind self-satisfaction, allowing them to re-evaluate themselves and resolve to transform themselves.

Understanding class struggle to understand self-revolution

How to proceed? They believed: only by understanding class struggle can one understand self-revolution. In addition to repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, they continuously examined the army's work, observing the leadership from the perspective of the troops and the work from the perspective of thought, raising the awareness of transforming their worldview. Previously, when problems arose in the troops, they focused more on work-related issues and rarely linked them to personal thoughts. In 1964, Party Committee members went to the companies to explain the 1960 Military Commission Expanded Conference resolution and discovered that some soldiers were influenced by bourgeois ideology, overly concerned about their personal future, and so on. They conducted a joint study and realized that this was a struggle between the bourgeoisie and us for the hearts of the younger generation, a living example of class struggle. Why wasn't it addressed earlier? The root cause lay in their inadequate understanding of ideological transformation and their unclear view of the problems in the troops. Many comrades said: we must not let old experiences restrict us. Now is a new stage of socialist revolution with new characteristics and new requirements. If we do not strive to study and seriously transform ourselves to adapt to new situations, we will fall behind the times. They also pointed out: whether or not cadres focus on transforming their worldview is not just a matter of personal improvement, but a matter that relates to the construction of the troops, the cultivation of successors, and the security of the state. To enhance the urgency of transforming their worldview, they continuously organized comparative reflections, observing how class struggle manifested in themselves. This made everyone further realize that in the face of heavy revolutionary tasks, the Party's demands for them were higher. If they relaxed their ideological transformation, they would not only be unable to lead but would also fail to pass the test of socialism.

Opening the door to self-revolution, willingly accepting mass supervision

How to transform one's worldview? In addition to advocating the philosophy of struggle, widely conducting criticism and self-criticism within the Party Committee, and learning and applying it in the struggle, they also realized from practice that they must open the door to self-revolution and willingly accept mass supervision. Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses. Only by mobilizing the masses can one wage war, and only by relying on the masses can one wage war." They believed that Chairman Mao's directive not only applied to revolutionary war but also to ideological revolution. They said: regarding the masses' opinions, merely being able to listen and endure without explaining or refuting is a low standard and does not qualify one as a truly self-aware revolutionary. One must go to the masses to speak, letting the masses evaluate. Their practice was: first, proactively going to the masses to discuss their shortcomings and ideological problems. They said: the more people who know one's shortcomings, the more supervisory power and determination to correct them. Over the years, this division's Party Committee has formed a system: after studying one of Chairman Mao's works and solving a problem, they would go to the masses to open their thoughts and hold a lecture meeting. At the lecture meeting, regardless of who represented the Party Committee to speak, they would discuss problems by focusing on themselves and discuss achievements and strengths by focusing on others; if a personal problem had an impact somewhere, they would go there to discuss it, listen to the masses' opinions, see what was lacking, and find the next direction for effort. They said: "Each lecture meeting is a warning bell for oneself, letting hundreds of eyes watch the change, making it better." In the past year, each member of the division's Party Committee has gone to the masses to lecture several times, from small meetings in office departments or company party branch meetings to large meetings with over a thousand people, and important issues were recorded and broadcast throughout the division. Each lecture brought further progress, and the more they lectured, the better they changed.

In the absence of criticism, one must go to the masses to find it

Listening to praise with the heart of receiving criticism, and in the absence of criticism, one must go to the masses to find it. In the past year, due to the cadres' relatively conscious efforts in self-ideological transformation, the masses gave fewer suggestions and more praise. Some masses reflected that in the past, they had reservations about giving suggestions to leaders, but now it was difficult to give suggestions to leaders because there was nothing to say. The cadres, with this issue in mind, studied Chairman Mao's words: "We must not become complacent and self-satisfied at the sight of achievements. We must curb self-satisfaction, constantly criticize our shortcomings, just as we wash our faces and sweep the floor every day to keep clean and remove dust." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, the cadres proactively invited some comrades from below to have heart-to-heart talks, asking them to observe the leadership's thoughts and style through work, deeply excavate the weak links in the leadership's thoughts and style. Because these cadres genuinely welcomed criticism, during the heart-to-heart talks, everyone still helped them find some problems. Everyone reflected that this was the leadership taking the lead in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, the leadership taking the lead in carrying forward the Party's style of seeking truth from facts, and the leadership taking the lead in implementing the five principles of emphasizing politics. This was a silent command; how the leadership led, the masses would follow. Because the masses helped the leadership with great effort, the masses were even more active in their own ideological revolution. They put the study of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront, everyone proactively opened their thoughts, and actively held lecture meetings. The ideological appearance of the office personnel was completely renewed, and the office work's awareness of emphasizing politics was also strengthened.

The fact shows that the revolutionization of the leadership will inevitably lead to the revolutionization of the subordinates; the revolutionization of thoughts will inevitably lead to the revolutionization of work. Now, this division's Party Committee holds the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher than before. The atmosphere of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the troops is becoming thicker, the Four Good movements are developing healthily, training time is reduced compared to before, but the results are better, last year was the year with the least production and planting, but the grain yield was the highest. As some comrades said: a change in thought leads to a change in everything, the troops follow the leadership's change, and for every step the leadership advances, the masses will advance ten steps.

    领导干部怎样才能当好革命化的带头人？
    沈阳部队某师党委介绍狠抓改造世界观的经验
    新华社沈阳十一日电  领导干部怎样才能老老实实听毛主席的话，狠狠地改造世界观，当好部队革命化的带头人？人民解放军沈阳部队最近召开的学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议上，某师党委介绍的经验是：党委成员既要念念不忘阶级斗争，提高改造世界观的自觉性和迫切性；又要“敞开门”，向群众“亮思想”，让群众来批评，依靠群众监督，才有可能成为革命化的带头人。
    重新认识自己，从盲目自满中解放出来
    这个师党委从一九六○年就响应了林彪同志发出的一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手的伟大号召，大抓毛主席著作的学习，领导干部学得越来越好，战士们学得也越来越有成效，各项工作都做得较出色。党委委员在学习中，逐步认识到学习毛主席著作，必须在“用”字上狠下功夫，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。过去，他们中有的人总认为自己根基好、底子厚，是“苦孩子”、“小八路”，跟毛主席闹革命几十年，经过战争考验，政治上出不了问题，自觉不自觉地把自己划到改造思想、防止“和平演变”的圈子外边去了。毛主席说：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。即使是对于马克思主义已经了解得比较多的人，无产阶级立场比较坚定的人，也还是要再学习，要接受新事物，要研究新问题。”又说：“在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造”。毛主席的教导使他们从盲目自满中解放出来，重新认识自己，决心改造自己。
      懂得阶级斗争，才懂得自我革命
    怎么办？他们认为：懂得阶级斗争才懂得自我革命。他们除了反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争等论述外，不断检查部队工作，从部队看领导，从工作看思想，提高改造世界观的自觉性。过去，看到部队里发生的问题，从工作上检查多，很少和个人思想挂起钩来。一九六四年党委成员分头到连队宣讲一九六○年军委扩大会议决议，发现个别战士受资产阶级思想影响，过多考虑个人前途等问题。他们一同进行了研究，认识到这就是资产阶级同我们争夺青年一代，就是活生生的阶级斗争。为什么没早抓？根子在哪里？大家通过找原因，挖根源，进一步认识到，由于自己对思想改造认识不足，对部队里发生的问题就看得不清。许多同志说：不能让老经验捆住自己的手脚，现在是社会主义革命深入发展的新阶段，阶级斗争具有新的特点，提出了新的要求，不去努力学习，认真改造自己，使自己适应新的情况，就要落在形势的后面。大家还指出：领导干部抓不抓世界观的改造，不仅是关系到个人好坏的问题，而且是关系到部队建设、关系到培养接班人、关系到国家安危的大问题。为了增强改造世界观的迫切性，他们还不断组织回忆对比，看阶级斗争在自己身上的反映。使大家进一步认识到在繁重的革命任务面前，党对自己的要求更高了，如果放松了思想改造，不仅当不了领导人，就连自己也过不了社会主义这一关。
    敞开门闹自我革命，自觉接受群众监督
    怎样改造世界观？他们除了提倡斗争哲学，在党委内部广泛开展批评和自我批评，在斗争中学，斗争中用以外，还从实践中认识到必须敞开门闹自我革命，自觉接受群众监督。毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”他们认为毛主席这一指示，不仅适用于革命战争，也适用于思想革命。他们说：对群众的意见，只满足于听得进，坐得住，不解释，不顶回，标准还太低，算不得真正彻底的自觉革命者，必须向群众去讲，让群众来评。他们的做法是：首先是主动地到群众中去，讲自己的缺点和思想上的问题。他们说：多一个人知道自己的缺点，就多一分监督力量，多一分改正决心。几年来，这个师党委形成了一种制度，每学习毛主席的一篇著作，解决一个问题，就到群众中去敞思想，开讲用会。讲用会上，不管谁代表党委去讲，都是讲问题时讲自己的，讲成绩和优点时讲别人的；个人问题在哪里有影响，就到哪里去讲，讲了以后，听听群众议论，看看哪里不足，找出下一步的努力方向。他们说：“开一次讲用会，就给自己敲一次警钟，让几百只眼睛盯着改，就改得好。”一年以来，师党委每个成员都到群众中去讲过几次，小至机关的一个部门、连队支委会，大至千人以上的军人大会，重要的问题还录了音，到全师去放。讲一次，进一步，讲得越多，改得越好。
  在没人批评的时候，要到群众中去找批评
    用听表扬的心情去听批评，在没人批评的时候，要到群众中去找批评。近一年来，由于领导干部都比较自觉地抓紧了自我思想改造，群众提意见的少了，受赞扬的反而多了。有的群众反映，过去给领导提意见有顾虑，现在是给领导提意见有困难，没啥可说的。领导干部们带着这个问题，学习了毛主席说的一段话：“我们决不能一见成绩就自满自足起来。我们应该抑制自满，时时批评自己的缺点，好像我们为了清洁，为了去掉灰尘，天天要洗脸，天天要扫地一样。”根据毛主席的这一教导，领导干部们主动邀请下面的一些同志，在一起开交心会，请他们通过工作看思想，透过表面看本质，深挖领导思想、领导作风上的薄弱环节。由于这些领导干部从内心里欢迎批评，在交心中大家还是帮助他们找到了一些问题。大家反映说，这是领导带头活学活用毛主席著作，是领导带头发扬党的三八作风，是领导带头落实突出政治的五项原则，这是无声的命令，上面怎么领，我们怎么跟。由于群众帮领导很有劲，群众抓自己的思想革命化就更积极。他们把学习毛主席著作放到了首位，大家都争着敞思想，主动搞讲用会，机关人员的思想面貌焕然一新，机关工作突出政治的自觉性也加强了。
    事实表明，领导干部的革命化，必然引起下面同志的革命化；思想上的革命化，必然引起工作上的革命化。现在，这个师的党委，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得比过去更高，部队活学活用毛主席著作的空气越来越浓，四好运动正在健康地向前发展，训练时间虽比过去减少，成绩却比过去好，去年生产种地是最少的一年，打粮却是最多的一年。正如有的同志说的：思想一变带万变，部队跟着领导变，领导前进一尺，群众就会前进一丈。
