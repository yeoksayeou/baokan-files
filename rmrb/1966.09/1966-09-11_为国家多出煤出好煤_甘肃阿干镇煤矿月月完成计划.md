The workers of the Akang Town Coal Mine in Gansu Province have, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, taken on the attitude of masters of the country and steadfastly maintained their production posts. They have been producing more and better coal for the state, and in recent months, they have consistently and excellently completed the state's production plans. They have also created multiple new production records since the mine's establishment.

During the Cultural Revolution, dozens of retired old miners from the Akang Town Coal Mine, though aged, have red hearts. They persistently study the works of Chairman Mao. With strong class feelings, they go down into the mines to propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of workers. They also pass on their experience and skills, greatly inspiring everyone and promoting the development of production.
