Title: Concentrate Firepower to Resolutely Fight Against Ideological Enemies

When I first joined the army, I had a strong sense of vanity. Whenever I did a bit of work, I wanted the leaders and comrades to praise me. If I didn't get any praise, I felt unhappy.

Later, I studied Chairman Mao's article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and realized that my inability to correctly handle praise was due to my selfish desire for fame and profit. Selfishness is the class enemy in one's mind. If it is not defeated, one cannot make progress. But how to defeat it? My understanding was not clear. I thought: fighting against selfishness is not a big deal; as long as I can resist it and not let it surface, it would be fine. However, this approach did not work. Whenever the opportunity arose, the "I" would come out and cause trouble again.

Once, during a field training exercise, I volunteered for every task, working hard without complaining. Comrades praised my performance. However, when the instructor made a summary, my name was not on the list of those praised. Later, I felt more and more upset, thinking that the squad leader had "stolen" my praise. Later, the squad leader talked to me, and I found out it was a misunderstanding.

However, this incident had a great impact on me. I thought: I know I need to change my old habits, but why can't I change them? The instructor told me: "Fighting against selfishness, relying on 'resisting' is not enough; one must launch a decisive battle." Then, he helped me study Chairman Mao's article "Concentrate Superior Forces to Annihilate the Enemy." After studying it, I suddenly understood. Chairman Mao, when discussing the deployment of battles and tactics, said: "We must oppose the erroneous method of underestimating the enemy and point out that our army must concentrate absolutely superior forces, that is, six times, five times, or four times the enemy's forces, or at least three times the enemy's forces, to annihilate the enemy's division (or regiment) at the opportune time." I thought, ideological reform is like fighting a battle. Dealing with the enemy in one's mind is the same as dealing with the enemy on the battlefield; one must follow Chairman Mao's instructions to fight. That is, for the wrong thoughts in one's mind, defeating several is not as good as annihilating one. To launch a decisive battle against bourgeois ideology, one must "reinforce" proletarian ideology, making proletarian ideology absolutely superior in one's mind. Only in this way can one achieve the victory of eliminating bourgeois ideology and promoting proletarian ideology. If proletarian ideology does not occupy an absolute superiority in one's mind, one can only fight a "defensive battle" and cannot fight a "decisive battle." Even the "defensive battle" cannot be fought, allowing bourgeois ideology to prevail. The reason why I went astray in ideological reform is here. How to "reinforce" proletarian ideology? I think it is to target one's wrong thoughts, choose Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, study and apply them repeatedly, and work hard on the "application"; it is to be bold, confront selfishness, pursue and fight it, find it and pull it out to fight; dare to expose one's wrong thoughts, dare to "set fire to oneself," widely solicit the criticism and opinions of leaders and comrades, and let everyone help fight against selfishness; widely learn from heroic and model figures, and seriously absorb political nutrition.

Understanding this, I grasped my desire for fame and profit, studied Chairman Mao's works repeatedly, and fought against it fiercely. This year, when our unit started construction, the company needed to select a few rock drillers. At that time, I thought: although being a rock driller is a bit hard, it is a pioneering and vanguard job, which is both glorious and has prospects; the living conditions are also better, so I applied several times. Later, according to the work needs, I was not approved, and the company commander praised me for daring to take on heavy responsibilities. When I heard this praise, I felt a bit uncomfortable. That night, I used Chairman Mao's teachings to reflect on myself, the more I thought about it, the more I felt my face burning with shame. I thought: my repeated requests to be a rock driller were not for the revolutionary cause, but for fame, profit, and enjoyment, which is a serious manifestation of selfishness. For this hidden selfishness, one must not let it slip away but must find it and fight it to defeat and eliminate it. I decided to uproot this selfishness and, in front of all the comrades in the company, voluntarily exposed it, letting the comrades help me criticize it and further raise my awareness.

The facts show: the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology is also a matter of "concentrating superior forces to launch a decisive battle" to win, and "scattering forces to launch a crushing battle" to lose.

    集中火力狠斗思想敌人
    解放军某部战士　王树华
    我刚入伍的时候，虚荣心很重。自己出一点力，干一点工作，就想让领导和同志们说自己好；如果得不到表扬，心里就不痛快。
    后来，我学习了《为人民服务》这篇文章，认识到：自己所以不能正确对待荣誉，是名利思想这个私心在作怪。私心，就是头脑里的阶级敌人，不斗倒它，就不能进步。可是，怎么斗倒它呢？认识并不明确。我想：跟私心斗，也没有啥，只要以后自己顶得住，不让它露头就行了。可是，我这种做法根本不管用，一遇到适当时机，“我”字就又出来兴风作浪了。
    有一次搞野营训练，我样样工作都抢着干，不怕苦，不怕累，同志们都说我表现不错。可是，指导员做总结的时候，表扬名单里就是没有我。事后，我越想越窝火，认为班长“贪污”了我的好。后来，班长找我谈心，才知道这是一场误会。
    但是，这件事对我震动很大。心想：老毛病知道要改，为什么总改不了呢？指导员对我说：“和私心斗，靠‘顶’是顶不住的，必须打歼灭战才行。”接着，他就帮助我学习了毛主席《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》这篇文章。这一学，我才豁然开朗了。毛主席在谈到打仗的战役战术部署问题时说：必须反对轻视敌人的错误的作战方法，指出“我军必须集中绝对优势的兵力，即集中六倍、或五倍、或四倍于敌的兵力、至少也要有三倍于敌的兵力，于适当时机，首先包围歼击敌军的一个旅（或团）。”我想，思想改造如同打仗。对待脑子里的敌人和对待战场上的敌人一样，也必须按着毛主席这个指示去打。就是说：对于自己头脑里的错误思想，击溃几个，不如消灭一个。要对资产阶级思想来一个歼灭战，这就必须往无产阶级思想上“增兵”，使无产阶级思想在头脑里占绝对优势，只有这样，才能取得灭资兴无的胜利。如果无产阶级思想在头脑里没占绝对优势，那就只能打“防御战”，不能打“歼灭战”。甚至连“防御战”也打不起来，使资产阶级思想占了上风。以前自己在思想改造上所以走了弯路，原因就在这里。怎样才能往无产阶级思想上“增兵”呢？我认为，就是要针对自己的错误思想，选择毛主席的有关教导，反复学，反复用，在“用”字上狠下功夫；就是要“敢”字当头，迎着私心打，追着私心打，找上门揪出来打；敢于把自己的错误思想亮出来，敢于“引火烧身”，广泛征求领导和同志们的批评意见，让大家帮助自己和私心斗；广泛地向英雄模范人物学习，认真地吸取政治营养。
    弄清了这个道理，我就抓住了自己的名利思想，反复学习毛主席著作，狠狠地跟它斗。今年我们部队施工刚开始的时候，连里要选几名风钻手。当时我想：当风钻手虽然苦一些，可这是个打头阵、当尖兵的活，又光荣又有干头；生活待遇也比较好，就三番五次地提出申请。后来，根据工作需要，我没有被批准，连长还表扬我敢于挑重担子。我听了这个表扬，心里倒觉得不大是味。当天晚上，就用毛主席的教导对照自己，越想越觉得脸上火辣辣地难受。心想：自己一再要求当风钻手，不是为了革命工作，而是为了图名、图利、图享受，这是严重的私心的表现。对于这种隐藏起来的私心，绝不能让它溜走，必须抓出来打，斗倒灭掉。我决心挖掉这个私心的根子，在全连同志面前，主动地把它亮了出来，让同志们帮助自己进行批判，进一步提高认识。
    事实说明：灭资兴无的斗争，也是“集中优势兵力打歼灭战”就胜，“分散兵力打击溃战”就败。
