Today, China has become the hope of the vast majority of young people around the world, especially the youth of Africa. It is the place that students, who are just beginning to encounter life and science, yearn for.

When the Chinese people are dedicated to opposing imperialism, calling for the unity of the world's people, and advocating for facing reality and pursuing truth, one will hear the cheers of the world's people for the Chinese people. History will record in golden ink all the efforts made by the Chinese people.

    全世界人民为你们喝采
    今天中国已经成为绝大多数世界青年、非洲青年的希望所在，是开始接触生活和科学的学生们所向往的地方。
    当中国人民致力于反对帝国主义，呼吁世界人民团结，号召面对现实追求真理时，人们会听到世界人民对中国人民的喝采声。历史将用金色的墨水写下中国人民所作的一切努力。
