Red Guards in Changchun City have established a Red Guard post at the bustling intersection of Stalin Street and Dagang Road. This has become an important stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

From dawn till dusk, Red Guards from various schools take turns here, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations and reading the Sixteen Points to the endless stream of passersby. They continuously spread news of the victories of the Cultural Revolution.

This busy thoroughfare is adorned with flying red flags. Revolutionary youngsters wearing red armbands distribute various leaflets about the Cultural Revolution to the passersby, advocating the destruction of the old and the establishment of the new. They also assist the police in maintaining traffic order.

Red Guards from Jilin University, who went to Beijing for revolutionary linkage and were received by Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square, rushed back to Changchun. As soon as they got off the train, without even returning to their school, they hurried to the Red Guard post to bring the good news to the revolutionary masses. They excitedly declared that they would model themselves after the Sixteen Points personally formulated by Chairman Mao, enthusiastically propagate the Sixteen Points, and be good red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. Their broadcasts attracted many listeners, who responded with enthusiastic applause.

Around this intersection, there are also many posters, big-character posters, and notices written by Red Guards and revolutionary masses. Revolutionary masses often gather to read them or listen to the Red Guards' broadcasts.

People enthusiastically praise and support the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. Around the Red Guard post, there are big-character posters from workers of the First Automobile Works and the Changchun Enamel Factory, expressing their enthusiastic support for the Red Guards. The police officers on duty here interact with the young revolutionary guards day and night. Besides performing their duties, they arrange seats for the Red Guards and help adjust the volume of the loudspeakers, allowing the Red Guards to conduct their broadcasts smoothly. The police officers said: Seeing the revolutionary spirit of these young revolutionaries, we are genuinely happy. We warmly welcome their revolutionary actions and firmly support their revolutionary actions!

    红色宣传员
    长春市的红卫兵，在最热闹的斯大林大街和大庆路交叉道口上建立起了红卫兵岗。这里成了宣传毛泽东思想的重要阵地。
    从清晨到夜晚，各学校的红卫兵们轮流到这里向川流不息的过往行人，一遍又一遍地朗诵毛主席语录，宣读十六条，同时不断传播文化大革命的各种胜利消息。
    这个车水马龙的通衢要道，四周红旗招展。佩戴着红袖章的革命小将们，向过往行人散发有关文化大革命的各种传单，向人们宣传破旧立新，同时也帮助人民警察维持交通秩序。
    去北京进行革命串连的吉林大学红卫兵，在北京天安门广场受到毛主席接见后赶回长春。他们刚下车，连学校也未回就直跑到红卫兵岗，把喜讯带给革命群众。他们激动地表示要模范地执行毛主席亲自制定的十六条，热情地宣传十六条，当好毛泽东思想的红色宣传员。他们的广播吸引了许多听众，大家报以热烈的掌声。
    在这个道口四周，还张贴着许多红卫兵和革命群众写的传单、大字报、通告等。革命群众经常围拢起来阅读，或者倾听红卫兵的广播。
    人们热烈赞扬和支持红卫兵的革命行动。在红卫兵岗周围贴有长春第一汽车制造厂、长春搪瓷厂等工厂工人写的热情支持红卫兵的大字报。在这道口值班的人民警察，和红卫兵小将们朝夕相处。他们在自己执行任务之余，为红卫兵安置座位，协助调整扩音器音量，让红卫兵很好地进行广播宣传。民警们说：看到这些革命小将的革命干劲，我们打心里感到高兴，我们热烈欢迎他们的革命行动，坚决支持他们的革命行动！
