Art is a weapon in the class struggle. It is impossible for art that praises both the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and applauds two opposing classes simultaneously, to exist. "The Red Lantern" praises the proletariat and exposes the enemy's brutality and deception. The workers, peasants, and soldiers welcome it enthusiastically, while the class enemies spit and vehemently oppose it. The films "Lin's Shop" and "City Without Night" glorify the bourgeoisie and defame the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Revolutionary people condemn them with both words and writing, while the bourgeoisie nod in agreement. Zhou Yang, however, absurdly claims that art can evoke the "resonance" of everyone and be accepted by all kinds of people. Of course, "singing" is inevitable, meaning one class nods, and another shakes their head; one class says it's good, and another says it's bad. "Singing" but not "resonating," each is different.

    “鸣”而不“共”
    四川内江纺织厂青年车工　吴玉彬
    文艺是阶级斗争的武器。既歌颂无产阶级，又歌颂资产阶级，同时为两个对立的阶级拍掌叫好的文艺，决不可能存在。《红灯记》歌颂了无产阶级，暴露了敌人的残暴和欺骗，工农兵群众热烈欢迎，阶级敌人溅着唾沫星子大加反对；电影《林家铺子》、《不夜城》为资产阶级贴金，给工农兵抹黑，革命人民口诛笔伐，资产阶级点头称好。周扬却胡说什么文艺能引起所有人的“共鸣”，“为各种人所接受”。当然，“鸣”是一定要引起的，这就是一个阶级点头，一个阶级摇头，一个阶级说好，一个阶级说糟，“鸣”而不“共”，各不相同。
