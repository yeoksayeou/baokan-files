The first and second groups of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from various schools in Hohhot who went to Beijing have returned. They brought back the boundless joy and excitement of meeting the great leader Chairman Mao, the passion from the revolutionary gathering in the capital, and the revolutionary experiences of the capital's revolutionary teachers and students. They returned, holding high the revolutionary torch lit by Chairman Mao himself.

At dawn, as the train wheels rumbled, still far from Hohhot, the young revolutionaries who had not slept well for several nights were already excitedly discussing: "Train, hurry up and rush! Let us bring happiness to our comrades soon, let us return to school soon, and let the revolutionary flames burn even more fiercely!"

As the Red Guards from Inner Mongolia University entered the campus, the revolutionary teachers and students rushed over to greet them, shaking hands warmly and congratulating them. Everyone heard that one Red Guard had shaken hands with Chairman Mao twice, and they all eagerly reached out their hands, surrounding him. A student asked him, "Which hand did you use to shake Chairman Mao's hand?" He excitedly said, "Our commander-in-chief Chairman Mao is too great, I used both hands to shake his hand." Then, the students eagerly reached out both hands to shake his hands, jumping up. Everyone also eagerly asked him, "Is Chairman Mao in good health?" He said, "Chairman Mao is in excellent health, with a radiant face and a spirited demeanor." The crowd immediately erupted in cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The Red Guards from the Inner Mongolia Medical College who returned from Beijing were also telling their classmates about the revolutionary situation in the capital. A female Red Guard said, "Ah! When we saw Chairman Mao, our hearts were about to jump out. We looked at Chairman Mao and thought: Chairman Mao! We will forever be your little soldiers, forever be the vanguard of the revolution! As we walked out of Tiananmen Square, we kept shouting 'Long live Chairman Mao!' and without realizing it, we waved our handkerchiefs and danced the 'Andai Dance,' singing 'From the Grasslands to Tiananmen.'"

Some Red Guards from the Inner Mongolia Medical College held an all-night meeting to learn from the experiences of the Beijing Red Guards, determined to learn how to fight in the struggle. A Red Guard who had just returned from Beijing excitedly said: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take the People's Liberation Army as our example, study Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points at all times and in all places. We will follow the instructions of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, use the Sixteen Points as our weapon, break through all obstacles, overcome all difficulties, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat more vigorously, and will not lay down our arms until we achieve complete victory!

    让革命的烈火更猛烈地燃烧起来
    ——记呼和浩特革命师生从北京回到学校
    呼和浩特市各大中学校第一、二批去北京的红卫兵和革命师生陆续回来了。他们带着会见伟大领袖毛主席时无限喜悦、无限兴奋的心情，带着首都革命盛会上的激情，带着首都革命师生的革命经验，高举着毛主席亲自点燃的革命火炬，回来了。
    黎明，在车轮辚辚声中，离呼和浩特还很远，几夜不曾好好睡觉的革命小将们，就激动地议论说：“火车，你快些奔驰吧！让我们早点把幸福带给战友，让我们早点回到学校，把革命的烈火更猛烈地燃烧起来！”
    内蒙古大学的红卫兵一进校园，革命师生们便围了上来，同他们热烈握手祝贺。大家听说有一个红卫兵两次握过毛主席的手，都争着伸过手来，围着他团团转。一个同学问他：“你是用那只手握过毛主席的手啊？”他激动地说：“我们的统帅毛主席，太伟大了，我用双手握了他的手。”于是，同学们争先恐后，用双手握住他的双手跳了起来。大家还急切地问他：“毛主席身体健康吗？”他说：“毛主席身体好极了，红光满面，神采奕奕。”人群中马上爆发出了“毛主席万岁！万万岁”的欢呼声。
    内蒙古医学院从北京回来的红卫兵也在向同学们讲述首都的革命盛况。一个女红卫兵说：“啊呀！当我们见到毛主席时，心都快跳出来了。我们望着毛主席，心里想：毛主席呀毛主席！我们永远做你的小兵，永远做革命的急先锋！走出天安门广场，我们还一直喊着毛主席万岁！喊着喊着，我们不约而同地甩开手绢跳起《安代舞》，唱起了《从草原来到天安门》来。”
    内蒙古医学院的一些红卫兵连夜开会，学习北京红卫兵的经验，决心在斗争中学会斗争。一位刚从北京回来的红卫兵激动地说：我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以解放军为榜样，随时随地学习毛主席著作，随时随地学习十六条。我们决心按照我们伟大统帅毛主席的指示，以十六条为武器，冲破一切阻力，克服各种困难，和广大革命群众一起，把无产阶级文化大革命更加轰轰烈烈开展起来，不获全胜，决不收兵！　新华社记者
