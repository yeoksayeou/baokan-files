The counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist rightist element Li Da, who arrogantly claims to be an authority on philosophy, harbors extreme hostility towards workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's philosophical works. He viciously curses workers, peasants, and soldiers, saying, "They don't even understand what material and spirit are, so how can they talk about philosophy?" He rages, "If workers, peasants, and soldiers study philosophy, what are we, the professional philosophers, for?" What a tyrannical attitude! But this is an era where workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters. Workers, peasants, and soldiers are the true masters of science and culture. Marxist philosophy originated from the revolutionary practice of the laboring masses. In the evil old society, mental labor and physical labor were completely separated, and philosophy was seized by the exploiting class "authorities." Now, we workers, peasants, and soldiers must return philosophy to its rightful home. We must grasp the greatest contemporary thought of Mao Zedong and overthrow all the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao teaches us that Marxist philosophy has two prominent features: its class nature and its practicality. A philosophy with such features can only be truly understood and applied by workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Marxist philosophy developed in the struggle of the proletarian revolution. It has a clear class nature. It scientifically reflects the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the laboring masses. It is a sharp weapon for workers, peasants, and soldiers to transform their subjective world and the objective world. Because of this, Marxist philosophy is a philosophy of struggle and revolution, a powerful ideological weapon for thoroughly destroying the old world and building a new world.

Such a philosophy, such truth, can only be truly understood and effectively applied by those who stand firmly on the side of the proletariat. We workers, peasants, and soldiers, who were once exploited by landlords and capitalists in the old society, were saved from misery by the great Chairman Mao. We have stood up and become the masters of the state. We cannot express in words our love and admiration for Chairman Mao. We deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth and a guiding light for revolution. With our boundless love for Chairman Mao, our deep hatred for class enemies, our resolve to serve the people wholeheartedly, and our lofty ideal of achieving communism worldwide, we study Chairman Mao's philosophical works and Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we can particularly understand Chairman Mao's teachings. For example, regarding the theory that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, we workers, peasants, and soldiers can learn it well and apply it effectively. Because this is a truth we have personally experienced. Look, wasn't Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits, which seemed powerful but were defeated by us, paper tigers? The American imperialism, which once monopolized the atomic bomb, isn't it also our vanquished enemy? And we, the laboring people who were once ruled, have we not overthrown the three big mountains that were once oppressing us and become the masters of New China? These truths are, of course, forever incomprehensible and unacceptable to the landlord class and the bourgeoisie. Li Da, who has always exploited the blood and sweat of peasants, fears workers, peasants, and soldiers' revolution the most and hates their rebellion the most. The nature of the exploiting class determines that he must oppose the revolutionary philosophy of the proletariat and Mao Zedong Thought. To say that he is an authority on Marxist philosophy is a huge joke!

Marxist philosophy has scientific practicality. Marxist philosophy did not fall from the sky, nor is it innate in people's minds. It originates from the great class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments. It is the objective truth summarized from revolutionary practice and turns around to guide practice. We workers, peasants, and soldiers have long been directly involved in the three great revolutionary practices and have rich practical experience. We learn philosophy from the need of practice, learn to use it, and use it after learning, so we can best learn and apply Chairman Mao's philosophical theories. For example, in our company, during the evaluation of the Four Goods, the first, second, and fourth platoons were all Four Good platoons, while the third platoon failed to be evaluated as Four Good for four consecutive years. The comrades in the third platoon, with this problem in mind, studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the relationship between internal and external causes. They realized that under the same conditions, the third platoon failed to be evaluated because it was not good at actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and its ideological revolution was not thorough. Therefore, they put actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the first place in all work, grasp ideology to lead business, grasp cadres to lead the masses, grasp the advanced to lead the backward, and do all work solidly, quickly changing the backward situation, and leaping into the ranks of the Four Good.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, which can guide practice and become a tremendous material force to destroy the old world and build a new world. Today is the great era when the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers grasp Mao Zedong Thought. For thousands of years, we have been locked out of the gates of philosophy. Today, we have learned and grasped Mao Zedong Thought, producing a force that can move mountains and rivers. The heroic people of Daqing, relying on "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," fought against nature, against the land, and against class enemies, and finally, in a short time, seized the oil field, ending the era of relying on "foreign oil" for our great country, and won glory for our great nation and people. The heroic people of Dazhai, firmly grasping Chairman Mao's instructions on self-reliance and striving for progress, have continuously overcome major disasters and turned the poor valley into a granary, setting a brilliant example for the country's agriculture. Our broad cadres and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army, with a strong emphasis on politics, study Chairman Mao's works extensively, and work hard on the "use" of them. Political awareness has greatly improved, and the spirit of communism has been greatly promoted. Many good deeds like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun have emerged. The movement of the Four Good companies has continuously developed. These ironclad facts are a powerful refutation of Li Da's slanderous remarks about workers, peasants, and soldiers not being able to study philosophy. It eloquently shows that we workers, peasants, and soldiers best understand the practicality of Marxist philosophy and can best use Marxist philosophy to guide practice. While the bourgeoisie's lord Li Da fundamentally does not act according to the principles of Marxist philosophy. Li Da, during the rising tide of the workers and peasants' revolutionary movement, pretended to hide in the university's study to "study" Marxism, which is completely contrary to the practicality of Marxist philosophy. What can he "study"? He can only "study" the philosophy of traitors, the philosophy of landlords, the philosophy of anti-party and anti-socialism!

The reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie strongly oppose workers, peasants, and soldiers studying philosophy, making philosophy seem mysterious and unattainable, aiming to isolate workers, peasants, and soldiers from Mao Zedong Thought so that this group of ghosts and snakes can peddle revisionist black goods in the philosophical world and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. Tell these reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, do not dream, your conspiracy will never succeed. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought has already illuminated the earth, the storm of the Cultural Revolution has swept the country, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have risen up to grasp and apply Marxist philosophical theories. The funeral bell of the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie has already tolled. We must seize back the philosophical front that has been occupied by the bourgeoisie and must raise and firmly plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on all fronts!

    工农兵是哲学的主人
    解放军某部　武兵
    反党反社会主义的右派分子李达，以哲学“权威”自居，极端仇视工农兵群众活学活用毛主席的哲学著作。他恶毒地咒骂工农兵“连什么是物质，什么是精神都搞不清楚，那能讲哲学”！他暴跳如雷地叫嚣：工农兵学了哲学，“那还要我们这些专搞哲学的干什么？”好一副哲学界“霸王”的面孔。但是今天是工农兵当家作主的时代，工农兵是科学文化的真正主人。马克思主义哲学本来就是从劳动人民的革命实践中产生的。万恶的旧社会，使脑力劳动与体力劳动完全分了家，哲学才被剥削阶级“权威”们霸占了去。现在我们工农兵就是要让哲学回老家，我们工农兵就是要掌握当代最伟大的毛泽东思想，把资产阶级反动学术“权威”统统打翻在地。
    毛主席教导我们：马克思主义的哲学有两个最显著的特点，一个是它的阶级性，再一个是它的实践性。具有这样的特点的哲学，只有工农兵最能领会，最能运用。
    马克思主义哲学是在无产阶级革命斗争中发展起来的，它具有鲜明的阶级性。它科学地反映了无产阶级和劳动人民的根本利益。它是工农兵群众改造主观世界和改造客观世界的锐利武器。正因为这样，马克思主义哲学是斗争的哲学，革命的哲学，是彻底破坏旧世界和建设新世界的强大思想武器。
    这样的哲学，这样的真理，只有坚定地站在无产阶级立场的人，才能真正地领会，很好地运用。我们工农兵群众，在旧社会给地主、资本家当牛当马，是伟大的毛主席把我们从苦海里救出来，使我们翻了身，成了国家的主人。我们千言万语也表达不完对毛主席的热爱和敬仰。我们深切地体会到，毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理，是闹革命的指路明灯。我们带着对毛主席的无限热爱，带着对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，带着全心全意为人民服务的决心，带着在全世界实现共产主义的崇高理想，学习毛主席的哲学著作，学习毛泽东思想。因此我们特别能够领会毛主席的教导。例如关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的理论，我们工农兵就能学得好，用得好。因为这是我们亲身体验过的真理。看，日本帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮不都是貌似强大但被我们打败了的纸老虎吗？曾经垄断原子弹的美帝国主义，不也是我们的手下败将吗？而我们这些曾经被统治的劳动人民，不是已经推翻了原来压在我们头上的三座大山，成为新中国的主人了吗？这些道理，对于地主阶级、资产阶级来说，当然都是永远不能理解、永远不能接受的。李达这个一贯榨取农民血汗的地主分子，最怕工农兵革命，最恨工农兵造反。剥削阶级的本性决定了他必然反对无产阶级的革命哲学，必然反对毛泽东思想。若说他是马克思主义哲学的“权威”，那真是天大的笑话！
    马克思主义哲学具有科学的实践性。马克思主义哲学不是从天上掉下来的，不是人们头脑里所固有的。它来源于伟大的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验。它是从革命实践中总结出来的客观真理，又转过来指导实践。我们工农兵群众长期地、直接地参加三大革命实践，有丰富的实践经验。我们从实践需要出发学哲学，学为了用，学了就用，因而我们最能够把毛主席的哲学理论学得好，用得好。例如，我们五连，在四好总评中，一、二、四排都是四好排，唯有三排连续四年评不上。三排的同志带着这个问题，学习了毛主席关于内因和外因关系的指示。认识到同样条件下的四个排，三排评不上，根本原因是三排活学活用毛主席著作和思想革命化不够。因此，他们把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，抓思想带业务，抓骨干带群众，抓先进带落后，把各项工作都搞得扎扎实实，终于迅速地改变了落后面貌，跃进到四好行列。
    广大工农兵群众活学活用毛泽东思想，就能够指导实践，变成摧毁旧世界、建设新世界的巨大的物质力量。今天是广大工农兵群众掌握毛泽东思想的伟大时代。千百年来，我们一直被关在哲学大门之外。今天我们学习了毛泽东思想，掌握了毛泽东思想，就产生了排山倒海的力量。英雄的大庆人依靠《实践论》、《矛盾论》，同天斗，同地斗，同阶级敌人斗，终于在短短的时间内，拿下了大油田，结束了我国依赖“洋油”的时代，为我们伟大的国家和伟大的人民争了气。英雄的大寨人，牢牢掌握了毛主席关于自力更生、奋发图强的指示，终于不断战胜特大灾害，把穷山沟建设成了米粮川，为全国农业树立了光辉的榜样。我们解放军广大指战员，大力突出政治，大学毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，政治觉悟大提高，共产主义精神大发扬。雷锋、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊式的好人好事大量涌现，四好连队运动不断地有新的发展。这些铁一般的事实，对李达污蔑工农兵不能学哲学的无耻谰言，是强有力的回击。它雄辩地说明了，我们工农兵最懂得马克思主义哲学的实践性，最能运用马克思主义哲学来指导实践。而资产阶级老爷李达，根本不会按照马克思主义哲学的原理办事的。李达在工农革命运动日益高涨的时候，装模作样地躲到大学的书斋里，去“研究”马克思主义，这和马克思主义哲学的实践性根本是南辕北辙。他能“研究”出什么来呢？他只能“研究”出叛徒的哲学、地主的哲学、反党反社会主义的哲学！
    资产阶级反动学术“权威”，极力反对工农兵群众学哲学，把哲学说得神乎其神，高不可攀，目的就是妄图使工农兵同毛泽东思想隔绝，以便他们这伙牛鬼蛇神在哲学界大肆贩卖修正主义黑货，为复辟资本主义开辟道路。告诉你们这些资产阶级反动学术“权威”们，不要做梦，你们这种阴谋是永远不会得逞的。毛泽东思想的光辉已经普照大地，文化大革命的风暴已经席卷全国，广大工农兵群众已经起来掌握和运用马克思主义哲学理论了。资产阶级反动“权威”的丧钟已经敲响了。我们一定要把被资产阶级霸占的哲学阵地夺回来，一定要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，高高举起，牢牢地插在一切阵地上！
