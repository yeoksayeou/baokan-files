	Recently, the broad masses of the commune members in Zherong County, Fujian Province, following Chairman Mao's thoughts on concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles, launched a mass campaign to eradicate pests. They successfully eliminated the floating dust insects and rice leaf rollers that were harming the rice crops.

	In late July, over 47,000 mu of middle-season and late-season rice in Zherong County were widely infested with floating dust insects and rice leaf rollers. To promptly eradicate these pests and ensure the healthy growth of the rice, the county's leading organs promptly organized cadres and commune members to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," helping everyone to understand that although there were many pests, as long as forces were concentrated and everyone worked together, they would definitely be able to overcome them. After raising awareness and making all necessary preparations, the entire county mobilized over 20,000 people daily from morning to night, spraying pesticides, beating the pests, and capturing them. When pesticides were insufficient, the commune members made 60,000 jin of homemade pesticides. During the pest control campaign, various county organs, enterprises, schools, and factories also sent large numbers of personnel to join the commune members in the pest control efforts. Through the joint efforts of the broad masses of cadres and commune members, the rice pests were completely eradicated in a few days. Currently, the rice in this county, after intensive management, is still growing very well. (Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, September 6)

    遵照毛主席教导
    开展群众性治虫斗争
    最近，福建省柘荣县广大社员根据毛主席关于集中力量打歼灭战的思想，开展了一场群众性的治虫斗争。一举扑灭了为害水稻生长的浮尘子和稻纵卷叶虫。
    七月下旬，柘荣县四万七千多亩中稻和晚稻，普遍发生了浮尘子和稻纵卷叶虫。为了及时扑灭这些害虫，保证水稻顺利生长，这个县的领导机关，及时组织干部和社员学习毛主席的《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，使大家认识到害虫虽多，但只要集中力量，一齐动手，就一定能够战胜它。在提高了认识，作好了各种准备之后，全县每天出动两万多人，从早到晚，喷药的喷药，打的打，捕的捕。农药不够用，社员们就制造了六万斤土农药。在治虫斗争中，全县各机关、企业、学校、工厂也派出大批人员，和社员一起治虫。经过广大干部社员的协力奋战，终于在几天内完全扑灭了水稻害虫。目前，这个县的水稻经过加工管理，仍然长得很好。（新华社福州六日电）
