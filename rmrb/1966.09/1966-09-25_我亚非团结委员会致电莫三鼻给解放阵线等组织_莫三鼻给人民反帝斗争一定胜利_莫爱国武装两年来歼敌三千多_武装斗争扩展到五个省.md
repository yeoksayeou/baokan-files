The Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity today cabled the Mozambique Liberation Front and the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee to mark the "Day of Solidarity with the People of Mozambique." The message expressed warm fraternal greetings to the heroic people of Mozambique who are engaged in a struggle against imperialism.

The telegram said: "The people of Mozambique are waging a heroic struggle against Portuguese colonialism to achieve national independence. This struggle is a severe blow to the Portuguese colonialists and, through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to the U.S. imperialists who provide military support to Portugal. It has made a positive contribution to the national liberation movement of the peoples of Asia and Africa. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the people of Mozambique against imperialism and old and new colonialism for national liberation. We are convinced that the people of Mozambique will strengthen their unity, overcome difficulties, and persist in their struggle to the end. Victory will surely belong to the people of Mozambique."

According to a report from the New China News Agency on September 24, the patriotic armed forces of Mozambique have achieved new victories in their armed struggle against the Portuguese colonialists, who are backed by U.S. imperialism, over the past two years. It is reported that the Mozambique guerrillas have killed or wounded more than 3,000 Portuguese colonial troops in the past two years, shot down several enemy aircraft, destroyed many enemy armored vehicles, and seized a large number of enemy weapons and ammunition. At the same time, the guerrillas have also destroyed some strategic roads and bridges controlled by the enemy.

In the course of the struggle, the patriotic armed forces have grown stronger. The number of guerrillas has increased from a few hundred at the beginning to several thousand at present. The armed struggle has spread to five provinces out of the nine in Mozambique.
