People from various countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have spoken out, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao Zedong as the great leader of the world revolution and Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding light for the oppressed peoples.

Mao Zedong Belongs to the People of the World

Pakistani writer Aqif Hakim said, "Chairman Mao Zedong belongs to the revolutionary people of the world. The people of the world need him, and they need Mao Zedong Thought to guide the great struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and neo-colonialism, and to build a new progressive society for humanity."

The Guiding Light for the Oppressed Peoples

The chairman of the Lao National Civil Servants Union, Vounlath, said, "Chairman Mao is a man of great foresight, a true Marxist-Leninist. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guiding light for the Chinese people but also for the oppressed peoples and nations of the world." He added, "All the peoples engaged in revolutionary struggle love Chairman Mao. In Laos, wherever Chairman Mao's works go, the people eagerly study them."

A Giant Red Star in Asia, Africa, and Latin America

The head of the Kagoshima branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Hirasaka Jitsumu, spoke to a reporter, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "Mao Zedong is a giant red star in Asia, and he is necessarily a giant red star for all of Asia, Africa, and Latin America." Hirasaka said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical guide for the liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

The Greatest Revolutionary Leader of Our Time

Lebanese writer Ibrahim Salameh said, "Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time, the greatest revolutionary leader of our time. Chairman Mao led the 700 million Chinese people to victory in the Chinese revolution. The influence of the Chinese revolution on the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is something that imperialism or revisionism cannot stop. The Chinese revolution is a model for the Arab revolution and the world revolution."

Mao Zedong Thought Is a Powerful Weapon

Somali writer Abdullaziz Nur Hersi said: "In China, every worker, peasant, soldier, and even housewife is studying the works of Chairman Mao Zedong. The works of Chairman Mao Zedong are the highest form of Marxism-Leninism of our time. He said, "Of course, studying the classic works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin is very important. But for the fighting peoples of Asia and Africa, Mao Zedong Thought is an even more powerful weapon. Many African friends have told me, 'The works of Chairman Mao Zedong are very necessary for our struggle.'"

The Greatest Revolutionary Genius of Our Time

The chairman of the Mozambique African National Union, Seyf al-Aziz Milas, issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency, saying, "The peoples who are struggling believe that Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary genius of our time. Mao Zedong Thought not only shows the oppressed peoples the possibility of victory but also points out the methods to achieve victory."

Illuminating the Path Forward for Latin America

The representative from Ecuador attending the Fourth Latin American Student Congress, Lupe Cabrera, praised Chairman Mao's revolutionary theory, saying: "Mao Zedong Thought is extremely important for Latin America. It illuminates the path forward and instills in the revolutionary masses the belief that for the proletariat, the only way to seize power is through armed struggle."
