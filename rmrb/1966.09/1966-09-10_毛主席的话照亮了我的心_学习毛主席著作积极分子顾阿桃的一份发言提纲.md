The words of Chairman Mao have illuminated my heart—An outline of a speech by Metu Tao, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works

Editor's Note: Comrade Metu Tao (female, 52 years old) is a poor peasant from Hongjin Brigade, Shaxi Commune, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province. She is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. Recently, some comrades visited her, and she gave a speech full of revolutionary spirit to the comrades, introducing how she actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works, and how, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, she overcame selfish and narrow-minded thoughts, becoming a new type of peasant who is selfless and dedicated to the revolution. How did she introduce it? Since she is illiterate, she had someone draw several dozen pictures as an outline for her speech. Each picture led to a segment of her experiences, a change in her thoughts, and an insight into how she actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works. Her entire speech sparkles with revolutionary thoughts. From this speech, one can see that Comrade Metu Tao has an infinite love for our great leader, Chairman Mao, and she learns and applies Chairman Mao's works with class feelings. We should all learn from Metu Tao, love Chairman Mao, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and deeply imprint Chairman Mao's words in our hearts and actions.

I lost my father at the age of three and my mother at twelve, and then I became a child bride.

At the age of eight, I started working at the Lita Silk Mill as a child laborer, enduring endless suffering. I worked twelve hours a day, earning only 12 fen. After giving birth to my first child, I returned to work just twenty days later. After working two night shifts, my child froze to death. I worked at the mill until I was twenty-four, but it was not enough to make a living, so I returned to the countryside.

Farming was also harsh, with landlords exploiting us ruthlessly. Renting land from the landlord, the grain we harvested was not enough to pay the rent. Borrowing high-interest loans, for every shi of rice borrowed, three shi of wheat had to be repaid. Begging the landlord to plow the fields, for every mu plowed, two mu of seedlings had to be planted first. With no other choice, I had to work on the landlord's fields, but the landlord only gave two shi of rice per mu, and I had to work from harvesting wheat to threshing rice.

During the New Year, the landlord ate fish and meat, while my family couldn't even afford to eat old wheat porridge.

When the Japanese devils came, they burned, killed, looted, and raped women, making life even more unbearable.

The Japanese devils implemented the scorched-earth policy of burning, killing, and looting everything.

After liberation, the clouds parted, and the sun shone. With the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we poor people stood up. After land reform, we received nine mu of land. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, there would be no Metu Tao.

In the past, during winter, we had no quilts, and in summer, we had no mosquito nets. After liberation, life improved. We have quilts now. Now we all have new quilts and bedsheets.

In the past, the whole family wore ragged clothes, but now the whole family has good clothes to wear. I thought I would never be able to wear a sweater in my life, but after the socialist education movement last year, I even got a woolen sweater.

Our grain supply increases every year, and we no longer worry about starvation. In 1965, the whole family received 2,700 jin of grain. I will listen to Chairman Mao's words, not forget the past hardships, and be thrifty with grain.

During the socialist education movement, I began to study Chairman Mao's works. The words in Chairman Mao's books are easy to understand and touch my heart. I have my son read them to me, and I remember them carefully. I have the confidence to study Chairman Mao's works well.

After hearing Chairman Mao's words, I learned about three people (Zhang Zedong, White Agnes, and Yu Gong), a broom (_Anti-Liberalism_), and understood the principles of being a person, feeling warm and happy in my heart, as if I had seen Chairman Mao and heard his instructions.

Chairman Mao's words made my heart bright.

Since I am illiterate, I listen more, ask more, think more, and remember more.

I decided to learn one character every three days. In a month, I would have learned "Serve the People" and "Selflessly Serve the People."

I study Chairman Mao's books and apply them. Chairman Mao told us to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, so I must serve the people wholeheartedly. Not listening to Chairman Mao's words, how can I be a poor and lower-middle peasant? Therefore, I did the following:

In the past, my family's chickens went to the ninth brigade's fields to eat rice. I thought the fields by the door were not ours, but the ninth brigade's, and whether we harvested more or less was none of my business. Moreover, there was so much rice, eating a few grains was like pulling a hair from a cow. After comparing with "Serve the People," I realized my thoughts and actions were wrong, so I used straw from my home to make a chicken fence, surrounding all the ninth brigade's fields.

Once, it was said that cotton would be sold the next day, and the women's brigade leader told us to pick the cotton carelessly. In the past, I would have agreed, thinking I could seize more work points. But this time, I thought of the "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, and told a few companions: "For the revolution, no matter what we do, we must focus on quality. We will pick after lunch, start early tomorrow at six o'clock." Everyone agreed, and we completed the task on time the next day with good quality. Because the cotton quality was good, the price was high, which was also good for the brigade. The brigade leader happily said, "Now I see the spirit turning into material." The women's brigade leader also said, "People are the primary factor."

One day, returning from the street, I saw two bundles of straw on the roadside. In the past, I wouldn't have cared. Two bundles of straw, for the whole brigade of ninety-plus people, wouldn't even be enough to heat a pot. But I thought of Chairman Mao's "completely" and "thoroughly," and realized that collective property, every blade of grass and every tree, must be cherished. Chairman Mao said to be thrifty in running the commune, how could I be irresponsible and wasteful? I thought of the thousands and tens of thousands of production brigades across the country, and the waste would be terrifying. I picked up the straw and took it to the warehouse.

Another time, there were still some cotton stalks left in the cotton fields. In the past, I wouldn't have picked them. It was too cold. But I thought of being a poor and lower-middle peasant, and I must be selfless for the collective and the revolution, so I picked them and bundled them into two bundles.

Another time, the brigade sent me to the food company's transfer station to lay the pigpen, but there was still rice on the straw. I thought of Chairman Mao's instructions to prepare for war and famine, and not to waste grain, so I called four old women and together we picked out the rice.

Another time, spreading ash fertilizer in the wheat fields. The lumps of ash fertilizer would damage the wheat seedlings, and it had to be broken up by hand, but the pig urine was very smelly and disgusting. What to do? I thought of Wang Jie's spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, so I broke up the lumps with my hands, ensuring the wheat seedlings were not damaged, striving for higher yields in 1966.

Chickens ate some rapeseed in the fields, and on the second day of the New Year, the brigade mobilized the members to replant the rapeseed. Some members said to let the families with chickens replant. I thought this was for the collective and the country, not for me to eat more. I called Wang An'an and together we replanted the rapeseed.

The brigade's sow was giving birth to piglets, and it needed to buy scattered straw to lay the pigpen. The brigade had to go to Taicang to buy it. I and Wang An'an saw scattered straw on the riverbank, so we went to pick it up and took it to lay the pigpen. In the past, I would have thought, there is a feeder to buy it, it's none of my business. Now, after studying Chairman Mao's books, I must do good things for the brigade.

Learning from the revolutionary spirit of the Dazhai people, they can achieve high yields on mountainous land, and our fields are good, so we must accumulate more fertilizer and strive for high yields. I called Wang An'an and Su Zhaodi, and the three of us went to the canal and used small brooms to sweep up the pig manure that had fallen inside, spreading it on the wheat fields to prevent it from being washed away by the rain. Although my waist hurt, I was happy in my heart.

After learning from Comrade White Agnes's spirit of "selflessly serving the people," I did the following:

One morning, I heard a few male members working early to dig river mud, and they said the pond was too watery and slippery, and they couldn't dig much today. I thought of "selflessly serving the people," so I quickly got up. Although I was not feeling well, to improve the work efficiency of those digging river mud, I still thought of putting others' difficulties first and my own difficulties later, so I got up and worked all morning, pumping out all the water in the pond.

Uncle Bing had bad feet, and once he was carrying yellow radishes and found it hard to walk. I wanted to help him carry, but he saw that I was also not feeling well and didn't let me carry. I helped him carry the basket and support him, telling him to wait, and I would send it to his house, then call his wife to carry it back. Another time, he went to the street to carry coal balls, so I helped him carry fifty jin of coal balls to his house. They thanked me repeatedly, and I said not to thank me, it was Chairman Mao who told me to do it, thank Chairman Mao. A woman was in difficult labor, and I saw that she was weak, so I sent her a jin of sugar and six eggs. In the past, I would have thought a jin of sugar could be made into cakes to eat, and six eggs could be stewed for three days' lunch. Now I understand that all farmers are one family, and we should help each other.

Another woman was sick, so I went to visit her and sent her five eggs, and the second time I visited her, I sent her a jin of buckwheat flour.

It was almost the New Year, and everyone was cleaning up. I, Wang An'an, the brigade leader's mother, and three work team members helped four families who lacked manpower to wash bedsheets, and in the afternoon, we sewed them up and sent them back.

Once, I saw Uncle Bing cutting sheep grass in the green manure field. In the past, I wouldn't have dared to say anything, and I might have even gone to cut it myself. But now I think "not saying anything to their face and gossiping behind their back," and "not caring about others' business," are all liberalism, and I can't be a good person, so I criticized him to his face. He was also good and accepted the criticism, not blaming me.

My son, Akunrong, is a militia member, and he did not obey the militia leader's orders. I knew about it and asked him, "Not obeying orders, putting personal opinions first. Only caring about the organization's care, not the organization's discipline. How did you study Chairman Mao's books?" At night, I held a family meeting, and everyone used Chairman Mao's words to educate him. After that, he really changed and became very disciplined, always running ahead of others when he heard the assembly whistle.

Our whole family studies Chairman Mao's works, studying together at the table in the evening, with quotations on the wall, learning two during meals, and two before bed, and applying what we learn.

My husband also did good deeds after studying Chairman Mao's works. He cut twenty-five of his own bamboo poles to repair the chicken fence for the collective.

My eldest son, Asnowrong, saw a large package of cotton sink into the river at the factory, and he led the way to jump into the river to rescue it.

I will also mobilize the whole production brigade, men, women, old, and young, to study Chairman Mao's works, and everyone will study seriously, only then can we farm well, achieving the four types of farming (farming for the revolution, scientific farming, democratic farming, and thrifty farming), putting quality first, not work points.

We must study Chairman Mao's books, and to do a good job in production, we must emphasize politics. Our production is good, supporting the PLA, supporting disaster-stricken areas, and supporting the Vietnamese people.

I want to stand at my doorstep and see Tiananmen. I want to study until I am old, and I want my children to also study and apply Chairman Mao's books well, becoming revolutionaries.

I also want to achieve "five hearts" and "four not falls": listen quietly, remember carefully, think patiently, ask humbly, and do decisively. Heavy housework, not dragged down; illiteracy, not difficult; busy work, not pressed down; urgent tasks, not fallen down.

### 毛主席的话照亮了我的心——学习毛主席著作积极分子顾阿桃的一份发言提纲

    毛主席的话照亮了我的心
    ——学习毛主席著作积极分子顾阿桃的一份发言提纲
    编者的话：顾阿桃同志（女，五十二岁）是江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队的贫农社员，是学习毛主席著作的积极分子。不久前，有些同志去访问她，她向同志们作了一个充满革命感情的谈话，介绍自己怎样活学活用毛主席著作，怎样在毛泽东思想指引下，克服了自私自利的思想，变成了一个一心为公、一心为革命的新型农民。怎样介绍呢？她不识字，就请人画了几十幅画作谈话提纲。一幅画引出她一段经历，一次思想变化，一条活学活用毛主席著作的体会。她的全篇谈话闪耀着革命的思想火花。从这个谈话里可以看到，顾阿桃同志无限热爱我们的伟大领袖毛主席，满怀阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作。我们都应该像顾阿桃那样热爱毛主席，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的话深印在心里，化在行动里。
    我三岁死掉父亲，十二岁又死掉母亲，就出来做童养媳。
    八岁开始进利泰纱厂当童工，受尽迫害，每天工作十二小时，工资只一角二分。生了第一个孩子后，二十天就去上工。做了两天夜班，孩子冻死了。在厂里做到二十四岁，实在不够生活，又回到农村。
    种田又受到地主的残酷剥削。租地主的地种，收的粮食还租完粮还不够。借高利贷，借一斗米还三斗麦。求主人家犁田，犁一亩要先给地主插二亩秧。没有办法，再包做地主的田，地主每亩地只给二斗米，但要从割麦包到稻子收上场。
    到过年时，地主吃鱼吃肉，自己家连老麦粞饭都吃不上。
    日本鬼子来后，烧杀抢掠，奸淫妇女，更无法生活。
    日本鬼子实行烧光、杀光、抢光的三光政策。
    解放了，拨开乌云见太阳，有了共产党和毛主席，我们穷人翻了身。土改后，我们分到了九亩地，真是没有共产党，没有毛主席，就没有我顾阿桃。
    从前冬天没有棉被，夏天没有蚊帐。解放后，生活好起来。我们有了棉被。现在都是新棉被、新被单。
    过去全家都穿得破破烂烂，现在全家都有好衣服穿。我本以为这辈子穿不着毛衣了，去年社会主义教育运动后，我还添了件毛线衣。
    我们的粮食一年比一年多，再也不愁挨饿了。一九六五年全家分到二千七百斤粮食。我要听毛主席的话，不忘过去苦，精打细算，节约粮食。
    社会主义教育运动时，我开始学毛主席著作。毛主席书上讲的话，一听就懂，句句讲到我的心上。我就叫儿子读给我听，自己细细记牢。我有信心学好毛主席著作。
    听了毛主席的话，晓得了三个人（张思德、白求恩、愚公），一把扫帚（《反对自由主义》），懂得了做人的道理，心里热乎乎的，说不出的开心，就像见到了毛主席，听到了他老人家的指示一样。
    毛主席的话说得我心里亮堂堂。
    我不识字，就多听，多问，多想，多记。
    我决心三天学认一个字。只要一个月，“为人民服务”、“毫不利己专门利人”几个字就学会了。
    毛主席的书，我学了就用。毛主席叫我们“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，我就要全心全意为人民服务。不听毛主席的话，还算什么贫下中农？因此做了下面这些事。
    自己家的鸡到邻队大田里去吃稻，过去认为门口的田又不是我们一队的，是人家九队的，收多收少不关我的事，而且稻子这么多，吃掉几粒就像牛身上拔根毛。我对照了《为人民服务》，才知道自己的想法做法很不对头，就用自家的稻草做了一道鸡篱笆，把门前九队的田统统围了起来。
    有一次，说第二天要出售棉花，妇女队长叫我们拣花马虎些。我听了这句话，要是过去我一定赞成，可以乘机多抢几个工分。但这次我想到了为人民服务要“完全”“彻底”四个字，就对几个同伴说：“为革命种田，无论做啥生活都要讲质量。我们一吃过午饭就拣，明天提早一小时上工，六点开始。”大家都同意，我们第二天中午就按质按量完成了。因为棉花质量好，售价高，对队里也有好处。队长高兴地说：“这下我可看到精神变物质了。”妇女队长也说：“还是人的因素第一。”
    一天从街上回来，看到两捆稻草丢在路边。过去我才不管呢。两捆草，全队九十多人，分到我头上，连锅也烧不热。但想到毛主席说的“完全”“彻底”四个字，我就想，集体的东西，一草一木都要爱惜，毛主席讲要勤俭办社，我怎能大手大脚不负责任呢？全国千千万万的生产队都这样，浪费要吓死人了。我就把稻草搬到仓库场上。
    又一次，棉田里还有一些棉花秸没有拔干净。过去我是不会去拔的，因为天很冷。但我想到我是贫下中农，一定要一心为集体，一心为革命，我就拔起来捆了两捆。
    还有一次，队里派我到食品公司中转站去垫猪圈，但稻草上还有谷子。我想到毛主席指示我们要备战备荒，不能浪费粮食，我就喊了四个老太婆和我一起把谷子拣了出来。
    另一次，向麦田中撒灰肥。一团一团的灰肥要压坏麦苗，弄碎它只好用手，但猪尿很臭，恶心得很。怎么办？我想起了王杰一不怕苦、二不怕死，就用手捏碎，不使麦苗压坏，争取一九六六年更高产。
    鸡在油菜田里吃了一些油菜，年初二发动社员补油菜。有些社员说让有鸡的人家去补。我想这是为集体、为国家。不是我个人要多吃些油。我就喊了王阿安一起把油菜补种上了。
    队里的老母猪养小猪，要买乱稻草铺猪窝。队里要到太仓去买。我和王阿安看到河滩上有乱稻草，我们就去捞起来拿去垫。如在以前，我会想，有饲养员去买，不关我事。现在学了毛主席的书，就要为队里做好事。
    学习了大寨人的革命精神，人家山地都能高产，我们田好，更要多积肥争高产。我就叫了王阿安和苏招弟三个人，到渠道里用小扫帚把遗落在里面的猪灰扫起来，撒到麦田里，免得一下雨就冲掉了。虽然腰很痛，但心里高兴。
    学习了白求恩同志“毫不利己专门利人”以后，做了下面一些事：
    一天早上，听到外面有几个男社员开早工挑河泥，我听他们说塘里水交关（多的意思），滑里滑坍，今天开早工，挑不了几担。我听了后，想到“毫不利己专门利人”，我就赶快起床。我虽然身体不大舒服，为了使挑河泥的人能提高工效，还是想到要把别人的困难放在前面，自己的困难放在后面，就跟着起来开早工，干了一早晨，把塘里的水全部舀干了。
    炳伯伯脚不好，有一次他挑黄萝卜，很难走。我要帮他挑，他看到我身体也不好，不让我挑。我就帮他提一提篮、一搭连，叫他等着，我送到他家，再叫他女人去挑回来。又一次，他又到街上去挑煤球，我就帮他送了五十斤煤球到家。他们再三谢我，我说不要谢我，是毛主席叫我做的，要谢毛主席。一个妇女难产，我看她身体亏，就送她一斤糖、六只鸡蛋。如在过去，我一定想一斤糖可以做饼吃，六只蛋炖炖可以做三天的午饭菜。现在懂得天下农民是一家，应该互相帮助。
    另一个妇女病了，我就去看她，送她五个蛋，第二次去看她，又送去一斤荞麦面。
    快过年了，都打扫卫生，我和王阿安、队长的娘，还有三个工作队员，帮缺少人手的四家人家洗被单，下午缝好再送回去。
    有一次，我看见炳伯伯在绿肥田里割羊草。要在过去，我一定不敢讲，甚至自己也去割。但现在觉得“当面不说，背后乱说”，“事不关己，高高挂起”，都是自由主义，不能做老好人，我就当面批评了他。他也很好，接受了意见，并不怨我。
    我的儿子阿坤荣是基干民兵，不服从民兵队长的命令。我知道后问他：“命令不服从，个人意见第一。只要组织照顾，不要组织纪律。毛主席的书你是怎样学的？”夜里，我开了一个家庭会，大家用毛主席说的道理来教育他。以后他真的变了，并且真的改了，很守纪律，一听集合哨音就起来，经常跑在别人前面。
    我们全家人都学毛主席著作，晚上围桌学习，墙上贴着语录，吃饭时学两条，临睡前学两条，而且学了要用。
    我的老头子学了毛主席著作，也做好事了。他砍了自己二十五根竹子为集体去修鸡篱笆。
    我的大儿子阿雪荣，在工厂里看见大包棉花沉到河里，他带头跳下河去抢救。
    我还要带动全生产队男女老小学毛主席著作，大家认真学，才会种好田，做到四个种田（为革命种田、科学种田、民主种田、勤俭种田），要把质量放在前面，不要把工分放在前面。
    要学习毛主席的书，搞好生产必须突出政治。我们生产搞好了，就是支援解放军，支援受灾地区，支援越南人民。
    我要站在家门口，看到天安门。我要做到老学到老，而且要自己的孩子们都学好用好毛主席的书，做革命的接班人。
    我还要做到“五个心”和“四不倒”：静心听，细心记，耐心想，虚心问，决心做。家务重，拖不倒；不识字，难不倒；工作忙，压不倒；任务急，别（跌的意思）不倒。（附图片）
