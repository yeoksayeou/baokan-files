The Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational has successfully concluded. We warmly congratulate the athletes from various Asian countries on their new achievements in this competition! We warmly congratulate the deepening of the fighting friendship between the athletes and people of Asian countries.

This invitational tournament was a high-level competition in the world of table tennis and a gathering of Asian countries' athletes and people to unite against imperialism. As some foreign friends have said, participating in this competition is not just for rankings, but for friendship and to promote the further unity of the Asian people against imperialism.

In this competition, athletes from various countries fully displayed their strengths and played in their unique styles. They learned from each other, exchanged experiences, and jointly improved. This will greatly promote the development of table tennis.

People are delighted to see that this invitational tournament has greatly promoted the independent and autonomous development of sports in various countries, further breaking the monopoly and control of U.S. imperialism over international sports affairs. We have already done this and will continue to do so. People of all countries enthusiastically support us in doing so.

This invitational tournament was held during the high tide of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the atmosphere inside and outside the competition venues was new and revolutionary. Particularly commendable is that the Red Guards, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, broke with bourgeois conventions and vigorously promoted Mao Zedong Thought in the vanguard spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This turned the sports venues into a grand school for the audience to learn Mao Zedong Thought, leaving a deep impression on friends from various countries.

Our national table tennis team is a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the sports front. They not only study and apply well in daily life, but also insist on studying and applying while facing problems in intense competitions. They listen to Chairman Mao's words the most; they do as Chairman Mao says. The outstanding achievements they have made in this competition are the result of their studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The new victories of our national table tennis team have inspired our athletes and the broad masses of people to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Many athletes from the countries participating in the invitational tournament have also seen the power of Mao Zedong Thought from the victories of our national table tennis team, loving Chairman Mao's works even more and loving Chairman Mao even more.

The Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational has concluded successfully. Our friends from afar will soon return. We keep your fighting friendship here, and you take our fighting friendship back. Let us unite closely, hold high the banner of the struggle against imperialism, march forward shoulder to shoulder, and advance together!

    在团结反帝的事业中携手前进
    北京国际乒乓球邀请赛胜利闭幕了。我们热烈祝贺亚洲各国运动员在这次比赛中取得的新的成就！热烈祝贺亚洲各国运动员和人民的战斗友谊得到进一步的发展。
    这届邀请赛，是世界乒乓球坛上一次高水平的比赛，也是亚洲各国人民和运动员的一次团结反帝的聚会。正如有的外国朋友所说，参加这次比赛，不是为了名次，而是为了友谊，为了促进亚洲人民进一步团结起来反对帝国主义。
    在这次比赛中，各国运动员充分发挥了自己的特长，打出了风格。彼此之间，观摩了球艺，交流了经验，互相学习，共同提高。这将有力地促进乒乓球运动的发展。
    人们高兴地看到，这届邀请赛，大大推动了各国独立自主地发展体育运动，进一步打破了美帝国主义对国际体育事务的垄断和控制。我们已经这样做了，将来还要这样做。各国人民都热烈支持我们这样做。
    这届邀请赛，是在我国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中举行的，比赛场内外充满了崭新的、革命的气象。尤其值得称道的是，红卫兵小将们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以无产阶级文化大革命急先锋的姿态，大破资产阶级的陈规陋习，大力宣传毛泽东思想。这就使体育场馆成为观众学习毛泽东思想的大学校，给各国朋友们留下了深刻的印象。
    我国乒乓球队，是体育战线上活学活用毛主席著作的标兵。他们不仅在平时学得好，用得好，而且在紧张的比赛中，仍然坚持带着比赛中的问题活学活用。他们最听毛主席的话，毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。他们在这次比赛中取得的出色的成就，正是他们活学活用毛主席著作的结果。
    我国乒乓球队取得的新胜利，鼓舞了我国运动员和广大人民更好地活学活用毛主席著作。参加邀请赛的许多国家的运动员，也从我国乒乓球队的胜利中，进一步看到毛泽东思想的威力，更加热爱毛主席著作，更加热爱毛主席。
    北京国际乒乓球邀请赛已经圆满结束。远方来的朋友们，将要回去了。我们把你们的战斗友谊留下来，你们把我们的战斗友谊带回去。让我们紧紧团结在一起，高举反帝斗争的大旗，并肩携手，共同前进！
