Chairman Mao said: “The tide of the people of the whole world opposing the American aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the people of the whole world against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will certainly achieve even greater victories.”

The Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation is the focal point of the world's anti-American struggle today. The Vietnamese people have demonstrated the power of people's war, achieving great victories, effectively weakening and tying down the forces of U.S. imperialism, and greatly encouraging and supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries.

In a desperate struggle on the Vietnamese battlefield, U.S. imperialism, on the one hand, is frantically increasing troops and expanding bombing, escalating the war; on the other hand, it is colluding more closely with the Soviet revisionist clique, repeatedly playing the "peace talks" trick. However, in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people, its counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy has repeatedly failed, fully exposing its paper tiger nature.

Facts have proven that the more frantically U.S. imperialism struggles, the faster it heads towards complete failure. Currently, it has already thrown more than 310,000 invading troops into the South Vietnamese battlefield, not only failing to extricate itself from the predicament but also like a wild cow charging into a fire, getting burned and cornered. In North Vietnam, since the U.S. began bombing more than a year ago, over 1,400 American aggressor planes have been sent to their graves in the fire of people's war; in South Vietnam, from July 1965 to June 1966, over 63,000 invading U.S. troops have been annihilated by the South Vietnamese military and people, with 27 entire battalions being completely wiped out.

After more than five years of heroic struggle, the South Vietnamese military and people have liberated four-fifths of the land and one million people in South Vietnam, establishing vast and consolidated liberated areas, forming a favorable situation of surrounding the cities from the countryside. They fearlessly face the enemy, who is armed to the teeth, dare to fight, and widely launch guerrilla warfare, building and developing a powerful people's armed force composed of main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units in the struggle.

Currently, under the great battle call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese people are striding towards new victories, determined to carry the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation to the end!

### 越南人民抗美救国斗争越战越胜

    越南人民抗美救国斗争越战越胜
    毛主席说：“全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”
    越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是当前全世界人民反美斗争的焦点。越南人民发挥人民战争的威力，取得了巨大胜利，有力地削弱和牵制着美帝国主义的力量，大大地鼓舞和支援着世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    美帝国主义为了在越南战场上进行垂死挣扎，一方面疯狂增兵，扩大轰炸，使战争不断“升级”；一方面同苏联修正主义集团加紧勾结，一再玩弄“和谈”骗局。但是，在英雄的越南人民面前，它的反革命两手政策屡遭破产，完全暴露了纸老虎本质。
    事实证明，美帝国主义越是疯狂，就越加速走向彻底的失败。目前，它已经把三十一万多侵略军投入南越战场，不仅丝毫不能摆脱困境，反而犹如野牛闯入火阵，被烧得焦头烂额，走投无路。在越南北方，自从美国开始轰炸以来的一年多时间内，一千四百多架美国强盗飞机已经葬身在人民战争的火海里；在越南南方，从一九六五年七月到一九六六年六月的一年中，侵越美军已被南越军民歼灭六万三千多人，有二十七个整营被全歼。
    南越军民经过五年多的英勇斗争，已经解放了越南南方五分之四的土地和一千万人民，建立了大片巩固的解放区，形成了农村包围城市的大好形势。他们在武装到牙齿的敌人面前，无所畏惧，敢于斗争，广泛地展开游击战，在斗争中建立和发展了一支由主力部队、地方部队和游击队组成的强大的人民武装力量。
    目前，越南人民正在胡志明主席的伟大战斗号召下，向新的胜利大踏步地进军，决心把抗美救国斗争进行到底！（附图片）
