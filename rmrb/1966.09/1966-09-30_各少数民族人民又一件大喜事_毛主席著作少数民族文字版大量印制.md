Date: 1966-09-30
Edition: 3

To meet the urgent need of revolutionary masses from all minority nationalities to study Chairman Mao's works, the Minorities Publishing House and relevant printing departments are taking revolutionary measures to print large quantities of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Korean, and Kazakh languages. They are also doing everything possible to speed up the printing of the popular edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." At the same time, it has been decided by relevant departments that starting from October 1, the paperback and hardcover editions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in the languages of all minority nationalities, as well as the hardcover editions of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" in types A and B, will all be sold at new prices. The new prices for these editions of Chairman Mao's works in the languages of minority nationalities are approximately half of the original prices. Previously, the paperback editions of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" in types A and B, as well as the plastic-covered and paperback editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in 64-page format, have already been sold at the new prices.
