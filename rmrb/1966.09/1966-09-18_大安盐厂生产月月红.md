The Da'an Salt Works in Zigong, Sichuan Province, has taken Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all its work, combining revolution with production. The workers' revolutionary spirit has been fully mobilized, and since the beginning of this year, the factory has exceeded the state plan in all aspects every month.

At the start of the year, the factory's Party organization focused on the ideological transformation of the workers, organizing them to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. With the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the entire factory launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The workers used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to sweep away the representatives of the bourgeoisie and all ghosts and monsters hiding within the enterprise. They vigorously criticized the reactionary technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, broke through all the old frameworks and habits in enterprise management, and created a new situation of all-round advancement on both the spiritual and material fronts.

    大安盐厂生产月月红
    新华社成都十七日电　四川省自贡市大安盐厂把毛泽东思想作为企业一切工作的指导方针，抓革命，促生产，职工革命精神大发扬，今年以来月月全面超额完成国家计划。
    今年一开始，工厂党组织就大抓职工的思想革命化，组织职工活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装职工的头脑。无产阶级文化大革命运动开展后，全厂职工进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，他们以毛泽东思想为武器，横扫隐藏在企业内部的资产阶级代表人物和一切牛鬼蛇神，有力地批判了资产阶级的反动技术“权威”，破除了企业管理中一切旧框框、旧习惯，使全厂在精神和物质两条战线上出现了全面跃进的新局面。
