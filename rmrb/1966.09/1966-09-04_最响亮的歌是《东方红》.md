The East is red, the sun is rising,
China has given birth to a Mao Zedong.
He strives for the people's happiness, hey!
He is the people's great savior.

The song that revolutionary people love to sing the most is "The East Is Red." We should sing it every day, every year, forever; we should sing it loudly, proudly, and wholeheartedly.

"The loudest song is 'The East Is Red,' the greatest leader is Mao Zedong." Revolutionary people love to sing "The East Is Red" because this loudest song passionately praises the greatest leader Mao Zedong. Because this loudest song enthusiastically expresses our voice, it conveys our boundless affection for Chairman Mao.

"Chairman Mao loves the people, he is our guide." He led us to break through countless obstacles, overcome countless reefs, and overthrow the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, achieving the great victory of the people's democratic revolution. He directed us to overcome various obstacles, conquer various difficulties, carry out the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and march towards communism.

Chairman Mao pointed out the revolutionary path for us and the direction of our advance. Chairman Mao brilliantly, comprehensively, and creatively inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism.

Chairman Mao is our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman. He is the most outstanding leader and the greatest genius of the contemporary proletariat. Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the Marxism-Leninism that transforms people's souls in contemporary times, and the strongest ideological weapon of the proletariat. We have boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao; we have boundless faith and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought are the eternal red sun in our hearts.

With the red sun in our hearts, we have a clear direction on the revolutionary path; with the red sun in our hearts, our stance is firm and our spirits are high; with the red sun in our hearts, we have a broad vision of the world; with the red sun in our hearts, our revolutionary enthusiasm soars; with the red sun in our hearts, we are unafraid of difficulties and wolves; with the red sun in our hearts, we dare to brave knife mountains and fire seas.

Revolutionary people have the red sun in their hearts, and their hearts are always bright.

We should sing "The East Is Red" with the most reverent intentions, the most fervent feelings, and the most uplifting tunes, to praise the red sun, propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought, and admire the countless heroes who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Let the song of "The East Is Red" resound through the heavens, let the radiance of the red sun illuminate all directions, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high all over the world!

Ghosts fear the sun, and ghosts and snakes are most afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. We should use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to overthrow all ghosts and snakes, eliminate all exploitative class thoughts, and sweep away all harmful pests!

Sunflowers face the sun, revolutionary people believe in Mao Zedong Thought the most. We should use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to transform our souls, create miracles on earth, and forge a brand-new world.

"The loudest song is 'The East Is Red.' We should sing it every day, every year, forever; we should sing it loudly, proudly, and wholeheartedly. Let the people's hearts sing red, let the east sing red, and let the whole world sing red!

    高红
    东方红，太阳升，
    中国出了个毛泽东，
    他为人民谋幸福，呼儿咳
        哟！
    他是人民大救星。…………
    革命人民最爱唱的歌就是《东方红》。我们要天天唱，年年唱，永远唱；我们要放声地唱，豪迈地唱，尽情地唱。
    “最响亮的歌是《东方红》，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东。”革命人民爱唱《东方红》，是因为这首最响亮的歌，激情洋溢地歌颂了最伟大的领袖毛泽东。是因为这首最响亮的歌，热情奔放地唱出了我们的心声，表达了我们热爱毛主席的无限深情。
    “毛主席，爱人民，他是我们的带路人”。他领导我们冲破重重障碍，越过重重暗礁，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山，取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利。他指挥我们克服种种阻力，战胜种种困难，进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，向共产主义迈进。
    毛主席为我们指出了革命的道路，为我们指出了前进的方向。毛主席天才地、全面地、创造性地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义。
    毛主席，是我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手，是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖和最伟大的天才。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。我们对毛主席无比热爱，无比尊敬；我们对毛泽东思想无限信仰，无限崇拜。
    毛主席和毛泽东思想，是我们心中永远不落的红太阳。
    心中有了红太阳，革命路上明方向；心中有了红太阳，立场坚定斗志昂；心中有了红太阳，放眼世界胸怀广；心中有了红太阳，革命豪情高万丈；心中有了红太阳，不怕困难和豺狼；心中有了红太阳，刀山火海也敢闯。
    革命的人民有了红太阳，心里永远亮堂堂。
    我们要以最崇敬的心意、最热烈的感情、最昂扬的音调，高唱《东方红》，歌颂红太阳，宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，赞美千千万万用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物。让《东方红》的歌声响彻云霄，让红太阳的光辉照亮四方，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在全世界高高地飘扬！
    鬼怪怕太阳，牛鬼蛇神最害怕毛泽东思想。我们要以毛泽东思想为武器，打倒一切牛鬼蛇神，消灭一切剥削阶级思想，扫除一切害人虫！
    葵花向太阳，革命人民最信仰毛泽东思想。我们要以毛泽东思想为武器，改造自己的灵魂，创造人间奇迹，闯出一个崭新的世界。
    最响亮的歌是《东方红》。我们要天天唱，年年唱，永远唱；我们要放声地唱，豪迈地唱，尽情地唱。把人民的心唱得通红，把东方唱得通红，把全世界唱得通通红！
