Lombok Island is one of the places where the right-wing reactionary military government of Indonesia has brutally oppressed and savagely massacred overseas Chinese the most severely. The victims here are eagerly awaiting the arrival of ships from the motherland to take them back. Recently, overseas Chinese who returned from Lombok Island to the motherland exposed the atrocities committed by the right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia, who ruthlessly massacred and oppressed overseas Chinese, and brought back the strong voices of thousands of victims on the island who demand to return to the motherland: "Ship of the motherland, come quickly!"

Since the right-wing military seized power in Indonesia last October, the mobs on Lombok Island have been screaming, "We must exterminate all the Chinese living on Lombok Island," "We must burn down all the houses and property of the Chinese." The mobs have committed horrifying massacres here, forcing tens of thousands of overseas Chinese to be concentrated in three small towns, including Anbanlan, cutting off their livelihoods.

Recently returned overseas Chinese have exposed that the Indonesian right-wing mobs used extremely barbaric methods to kill overseas Chinese. Most of the victims were killed by the mobs with daggers. A returned overseas Chinese in Guangzhou exposed the situation where her uncle Zhang Quanhou and her cousin Zhang Jinfang were killed by the mobs. Leather merchant Zhang Quanhou was killed by the mobs who were hiding outside his door with daggers on the night of December 25 last year when he went out to check the noise of a broken streetlight. The mobs then rushed into the house and killed Zhang Jinfang with daggers, looting all the property in the store and leaving.

Even more brutal was the mobs using a short sword with poisoned blades to kill people. This sword is lethal upon contact with blood. A overseas Chinese named Shen Defa on the island was killed by the mobs with this poisoned sword. The mobs stabbed his chest and waist with the poisoned sword, and although the wounds were small, he suffered greatly and died before he could be taken to the hospital.

The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces also inhumanely insulted and killed women and children on Lombok Island. The wife of a overseas Chinese named Wu Yushen living in Banzhen Town was pregnant and about to give birth. The mobs sealed her and her six children in a room and then set the house on fire, burning the mother and her seven children to death in their screams for help. A overseas Chinese woman named Zhang Meizhen in the western part of Lombok Island had her husband killed by the mobs three days after their wedding. Zhang Meizhen was raped and then brutally killed. Many overseas Chinese women on the island have gone missing, and their whereabouts are unknown. Some overseas Chinese women have been taken by the mobs and subjected to inhuman torture.

In the face of the atrocities committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, many patriotic overseas Chinese bravely fought back and united in the struggle, showing a high degree of mutual assistance and love. In Anbanlan Town, a overseas Chinese middle school student and his mother were severely injured by the mobs with knives. Local overseas Chinese immediately sent them to the hospital for emergency treatment, and many overseas Chinese risked their lives to donate blood. Many overseas Chinese who had their homes burned and looted and lost their livelihoods received help from other overseas Chinese.

The right-wing military government of Indonesia is so crazy in its anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese actions that it has met with the resolute opposition of the Indonesian workers and peasants. Many people risked their lives to protect overseas Chinese. When the army training regiment led by Nasution and the extremely reactionary Anso Youth League mobs were killing and setting fires on Lombok Island, the Indonesian people warned the overseas Chinese in advance and helped them escape. Once, when the Anso Youth League mobs were looting a town, two elderly overseas Chinese escaped from the town. The mobs chased after them, but a few young Indonesian farmers quickly ran to support the two elderly people and hid them in the forest, saving their lives. A overseas Chinese who recently returned from Lombok Island said that his cousin was riding a bicycle past the road near Anbanlan Town one day and was suddenly stabbed in the back by a group of mobs with daggers. He supported himself on the bicycle and rode away from the mobs' pursuit. An Indonesian helped him pull out the dagger and secretly took him to the hospital for treatment.

The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces committed anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese atrocities, claiming that this was a "reflection of the anger of the masses." The above facts expose their lies and slander. The deep friendship between the two peoples cannot be destroyed by any force.

Now, the lives of overseas Chinese living in Indonesia are in danger, and many victims have lost their livelihoods. They eagerly hope that the motherland will send ships to take them back. Recently returned overseas Chinese said that before they returned to the motherland, many people cried and held their hands, saying, "When you return to the motherland, you must immediately report to the government of the motherland and let the ships of the motherland come quickly to take us back."

Sending ships to bring back the victims who voluntarily return to the motherland is an inalienable right of the Chinese government to protect its citizens. The Indonesian government must ensure the smooth progress of this work by the Chinese government.

### “祖国的船，快来吧！”——印度尼西亚龙目岛受难华侨的呼声

    “祖国的船，快来吧！”
    ——印度尼西亚龙目岛受难华侨的呼声
    龙目岛，是印度尼西亚右派反动军人政府疯狂蹂躏与野蛮屠杀华侨最严重的地方之一。这里的受害华侨，日夜等待着祖国派船去接运他们回国。不久前从龙目岛回国的华侨控诉了印度尼西亚右派反动势力残忍屠杀和蹂躏华侨的暴行，带回了岛上数千名要求回国的受害华侨的强烈呼声：“祖国的船，快来吧！”
    从去年十月印度尼西亚右派军人篡夺政权以后，龙目岛上的暴徒便疯狂叫嚣：“要斩尽杀绝住在龙目岛上的中国人”，“要烧掉所有中国人的房屋和财产”。暴徒们在这里连续制造了骇人听闻的惨案，岛上有成千上万名华侨，被右派军人和暴徒强迫集中在安班兰等三个小镇上，断绝了他们的生计。
    新近从龙目岛归来的华侨控诉说，印度尼西亚右派暴徒用极其野蛮的手段杀害华侨，被害者多数都是被暴徒用匕首杀死的。一位回到广州的归侨控诉了暴徒杀害她伯父张权厚和她堂兄张锦芳的情况。皮革商人张权厚去年十二月二十五日夜间，听到门外的日光灯被人打烂的响声，就出门察看，黑暗中被事先躲在门外的暴徒用匕首杀死。暴徒们闯进屋后又用匕首杀死了张锦芳，然后把店里的财产抢劫一空而去。更为残暴的是暴徒们用一种刃上带毒的短剑杀人。这种剑见血封喉，能立即致人死命。岛上一位名叫沈德发的华侨就是被暴徒用这种毒剑杀死的，暴徒用毒剑刺伤他的胸部和腰部，伤口虽然很小，但他受伤后痛苦万状，还没有来得及送到医院就死了。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力，还灭绝人性地侮辱和杀害龙目岛上的妇女和儿童。居住在班卒镇的华侨吴玉殿的妻子，正怀孕待产，暴徒将她和她的六个孩子封闭在室内，然后举火焚烧房屋，母子七人在呼救声中被活活烧死。龙目岛西部的华侨妇女张美珍，结婚三天丈夫就被暴徒杀死，张美珍被奸污后也惨遭杀害。岛上还有许多华侨妇女失踪，至今生死不明；有的华侨妇女被暴徒霸占，遭受非人的折磨。
    在印度尼西亚右派反动势力的暴行面前，许多爱国华侨不畏强暴，英勇斗争，并且在斗争中团结一致，表现了高度的互助友爱精神。安班兰镇一个华侨中学生和他的妈妈被暴徒用刀砍成重伤，当地华侨立即把他们送进医院抢救，许多华侨冒着生命危险去输血。许多被暴徒烧光抢光、生计断绝的受害华侨，普遍得到了其他华侨的帮助。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权如此疯狂地反华、排华，遭到了印度尼西亚工人、农民的坚决反对，许多人冒着危险保护华侨。当纳苏蒂安的陆军教导团和反动透顶的安索青年团的暴徒在龙目岛杀人放火的时候，印度尼西亚人民事先给华侨报信，帮助华侨避难。有一次，安索青年团的暴徒在洗劫一个镇时，有两个华侨老人从镇上逃了出来。暴徒在后面紧紧追赶，这时有几个印度尼西亚青年农民赶紧跑去搀扶着这两个老人躲进森林，使他们幸免于难。不久前从龙目岛归国的一位华侨说，他的表哥一天骑着自行车路过安班兰镇附近的公路，被突然跑来的一群暴徒用匕首刺进了脊背。他支撑着骑车拚命向前奔驰，摆脱了暴徒的追赶，一位印度尼西亚人帮他拔下匕首，又秘密地把他送到医院治疗。
    印度尼西亚右派反动势力制造了反华排华的暴行，却说这是“人民大众愤怒的反映”。上述事实揭穿了他们的造谣诬蔑，两国人民的深情厚谊是任何力量也破坏不了的。
    现在，居住在印度尼西亚的华侨生命毫无保障，许多受难华侨已经丧失生计，他们殷切地盼望着祖国派船去把他们接运回国。新近归国的华侨说，当他们归国之前向亲友们告别时，许多人流着眼泪拉着他们的手说：“你们回到祖国，一定要立即向祖国政府报告，让祖国的船快来接运我们。”
    派船接运自愿归国的受害华侨，是我国政府不容剥夺的护侨权利。印度尼西亚政府必须保证中国政府这一工作的顺利进行。
