Mao Zedong, more than thirty years ago, when discussing the great significance of the Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, pointed out: "The Long March is unprecedented in history, the Long March is a manifesto, the Long March is a propaganda team, the Long March is a sowing machine."

The People's Liberation Army is forever a brave and skilled fighting force armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time, it is a working team that helps the masses build revolutionary governments, develop production, and improve living conditions. It is a propaganda team that awakens the political consciousness of the masses.

In April of this year, a unit of the People's Liberation Army participating in the anti-disaster struggle in the Hebei Province's Xingtai region maintained and carried forward the revolutionary traditions of our army. They acted as a propaganda team and sowing machine for Mao Zedong Thought. In the earthquake-stricken areas, over the course of more than a month, they traversed nineteen counties and cities, and 5,300 production brigades, propagating Mao Zedong Thought to 3.9 million people.

Chairman Mao's words have the highest authority and the greatest power. The masses understand them as soon as they hear them and they work as soon as they use them. Cadres, soldiers, and poor and lower-middle peasants together, with problems in mind, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. This enabled the broad masses of people in the disaster-stricken areas to see light in times of difficulty and to boost their courage. Facing the severe disasters caused by the earthquake, they displayed the heroic spirit of "the house may collapse, but the will does not waver, the earth may shake, but the heart remains steadfast." They upheld the spirit of collectivism, self-reliance, and hard work, developed production, and rebuilt their homes. The entire disaster-stricken area presented a new and vibrant scene of "people changing spirit and land changing appearance."

Practice has proven that once Mao Zedong Thought is disseminated among the broad masses and combined with them, it can produce a great force to transform society and nature.

Learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, making Mao Zedong Thought take root, sprout, bloom, and bear fruit among the 700 million people, is our Party's glorious mission. With the 700 million people mastering Mao Zedong Thought, they can liberate themselves from the corrupt influences of all exploiting classes over thousands of years, change the entire social spiritual outlook, uproot revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism in our country, build our great socialist motherland well, and make a great contribution to the world's revolutionary people.

Every Communist Party member and revolutionary fighter should, at all times and in all places, propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the broad masses, and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions.

Propagating to the masses is also educating oneself. Every time propaganda is done, it is the best kind of learning. In the process of propaganda, integrating learning with propaganda and learning with application, better promotes one's own thought revolutionization.

Let us make learning and spreading Mao Zedong Thought our lifelong mission!

    传播毛泽东思想
    毛泽东同志三十多年前，在论述中国工农红军长征的伟大意义时指出：“长征是历史纪录上的第一次，长征是宣言书，长征是宣传队，长征是播种机。”
    人民解放军永远是用毛泽东思想武装起来的英勇善战的战斗队，同时是帮助群众建设革命政权、发展生产、改善生活的工作队，是启发群众政治觉悟的宣传队。
    今年四月间，参加河北省邢台地区抗灾斗争的人民解放军某部，保持和发扬了我军的革命传统，当毛泽东思想的宣传队和播种机。他们在地震受灾地区，历时一个多月，走遍十九个县、市，五千三百多个生产大队，向三百九十多万群众宣传了伟大的毛泽东思想。
    毛主席的话威信最高，威力最大，群众一听就懂，一用就灵。干部战士和贫下中农一起，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，使灾区广大人民在困难的时候，看到了光明，提高了勇气。他们面对着地震造成的严重灾害，表现了“房倒志不倒，地动心不摇”的英雄气概，发扬了一心为公，舍己为人的集体主义精神，自力更生，奋发图强，发展生产，重建家园。整个灾区出现了“人换精神地换貌”的崭新气象。
    实践证明，毛泽东思想一旦和广大群众见面，和广大群众结合，就可以产生改造社会、改造自然的伟大力量。
    学习毛泽东思想，宣传毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想在七亿人民中生根、发芽、开花、结果，这是我们全党的光荣任务。七亿人民掌握了毛泽东思想，就能够使我国人民从几千年来一切剥削阶级的腐朽习惯势力中解放出来，改变整个社会的精神面貌，就能够挖掉修正主义的根子，防止资本主义在我国复辟，就能够把我们伟大的社会主义祖国建设好，就能够对世界人民的革命作出伟大的贡献。
    每个共产党员，每个革命战士，都应当随时随地向广大群众宣传毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想去占领一切阵地。
    宣传群众，也就是教育自己。每做一次宣传，便是一次最好的学习。在宣传过程中，把学习和宣传、学习和运用统一起来，更好地促进自己的思想革命化。
    让我们把学习和传播毛泽东思想，当作自己毕生的事业！
