More than ten thousand Red Guards from colleges and universities in Shenyang enthusiastically responded to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, holding a "Learn from Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, Seize the Revolution, and Promote Production Mobilization Meeting" on the afternoon of the 17th.

Representatives from Liaoning University, Northeast Institute of Technology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical College, and other institutions expressed at the meeting: We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, seize the revolution, promote production, go to the countryside to participate in the autumn harvest, and learn from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They unanimously requested that the Shenyang City College and University Red Guards Headquarters actively organize and specifically arrange actions to support the autumn harvest in the countryside. The Red Guards from the Northeast Institute of Technology also applied to be the first batch to go to the countryside.

After the meeting, many schools' Red Guards actively prepared to go to the countryside. In the morning of the 18th, more than four hundred Red Guards from Liaoning University, carrying the works of Chairman Mao and holding high red flags, rushed to the front line of agricultural production. They guaranteed: They would humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, study and apply Chairman Mao's works together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, actively participate in labor, fear no hardship, and fear no fatigue, supporting the peasants to achieve victory in the autumn harvest. The Red Guards from Shenyang Agricultural College decided that within the next month, each person would participate in labor in the countryside for twelve days. Already, more than two hundred people went to the countryside to participate in the autumn harvest on the 17th.
