The farce of the "Constitutional Assembly Election" staged by American imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam has ended in a shameful failure.

This farce is an important part of American imperialism's scheme to occupy South Vietnam. American imperialism arrogantly hopes to create a so-called "broad-based civilian government" in South Vietnam through this "election," in order to dress up its puppet regime in the guise of "independence" and "democracy," and to manufacture a "legal" basis for the United States to occupy South Vietnam.

This plot by American imperialism has met with strong opposition from the people of South Vietnam. The only true representative of the people of South Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, has resolutely condemned this political deception by American imperialism and its lackeys, and called on the people of South Vietnam to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and overthrow the puppet regime. In the areas under the control of the American puppet regime, the broad masses of the people, despite the persecution and suppression by the American puppet clique, have launched a wave of struggle against and boycott of the "election," holding large-scale meetings, demonstrations, and hunger strikes. The resolute struggle of the people of South Vietnam has completely ruined this sham election staged by the American puppet clique.

The American puppet clique attempts to force the people of South Vietnam to accept this "election" farce with bayonets. However, the "polling stations" in the areas under American puppet control are cold and deserted, with no one paying attention; while the sounds of bombs and gunfire from the South Vietnamese people's armed forces attacking the American puppet clique resound inside and outside Saigon, frightening the American bandits who dare not step out of their barracks for a single step. The people of South Vietnam have firmly declared that they resolutely reject any "civilian government" manufactured by American imperialism and demand their own independence and liberation.

While American imperialism is escalating the war, it is directing this farce of a sham election with bayonets, which is a sign of its desperation in South Vietnam. Its attempts at military suppression and political deception have both failed. As Chairman Mao has pointed out, "Those supported by imperialism are precisely those who are despised by the broad masses of the people." The lackeys of American imperialism are despised by the people of South Vietnam. American imperialism and its lackeys are increasingly isolated. The just struggle of the people of South Vietnam will continue to develop. All the struggles of American imperialism will not be able to save it from failure.

    美国刺刀导演的丑剧
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义和它的走狗在南越上演的一出“制宪议会选举”的丑剧，已经以可耻的失败告终。
    这出丑剧是美帝国主义霸占南越的阴谋的一个重要部分。美帝国主义妄想通过这次“选举”，在南越搞出一个所谓“基础广泛的文官政府”来，以便给它的傀儡披上“独立”、“民主”的外衣，并且为美国霸占南越制造“合法”的根据。
    美帝国主义的这个阴谋，遭到了南越人民的强烈反对。南越人民的唯一真正代表越南南方民族解放阵线，坚决谴责美帝国主义及其走狗的这个政治骗局，号召越南南方人民彻底打败美国侵略者，推翻傀儡政权。在美伪统治地区，广大人民不顾美伪集团的迫害和镇压，掀起了反对和抵制“选举”的斗争浪潮，举行了大规模的集会、示威和绝食。南越人民的坚决斗争，使美伪集团制造的这次伪选完全破产了。
    美伪集团妄想用刺刀迫使南越人民接受这个“选举”骗局。但是，美伪统治区的“投票站”冷冷清清，无人理睬；而西贡市内外南越人民武装袭击美伪集团的炸弹声和枪声，却此落彼起，吓得美国强盗整天躲在营房里，不敢外出一步。南越人民坚定不移地宣告，他们坚决不要美帝国主义制造的什么“文官政府”，而要自己的独立和解放。
    美帝国主义在加紧扩大战争的同时，用刺刀导演这一出伪选丑剧，这是它在南越走投无路的表现。它的武力镇压和政治欺骗都失败了。正如毛主席所指出的，“帝国主义所支持的人，正是广大人民所唾弃的人。”美帝国主义的走狗，遭到了南越人民的唾弃。美帝国主义及其走狗更加陷于孤立。南越人民的正义斗争将更加发展。美帝国主义的一切挣扎，都不能挽救它的失败。
