According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Santiago: The organ newspaper of the Chilean Revolutionary Communist Party, "Spartacus," recently published an article praising the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution as "another great contribution made by the Chinese people to the world revolution."

The article points out that the Chinese cultural revolution is a major battle in the struggle against capitalism and revisionism, and is a fatal blow to the imperialists and reactionaries who fantasize that revisionism will succeed in China.

The article emphasizes that "Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental weapon of the Chinese proletariat in carrying out the cultural revolution." It says that the reactionaries and imperialists' intense attacks on China's cultural revolution are precisely the best proof that this revolution is being carried out correctly and timely.

The article states, "From the early betrayals of the social democratic parties to the revisionism of Khrushchev and his successors, anti-proletarian political activities have always been preceded by a flood of bourgeois ideology in the fields of education and the arts." The article says, "Chairman Mao Zedong has clearly summarized the international experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat. From his correct analysis, it can be understood that the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, runs through the entire socialist stage. To ensure the construction of socialism and to prevent the restoration of capitalism, it is necessary to carry the socialist revolution to the end on the political front, the economic front, the ideological front, and the cultural front." It says, "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which is loyal to the Marxist-Leninist line and guided by Mao Zedong Thought, has remained vigilant and has continuously carried out the struggle to eliminate the influence of the bourgeoisie in the cultural sphere."

The article concludes by pointing out that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a new historical phenomenon with extremely profound significance.

    毛主席总结了无产阶级专政的国际经验  文化大革命是灭资反修斗争的必要战役
    据新华社讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利革命共产党机关报《斯巴达克报》最近发表文章，赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命是“中国人民对世界革命作出的又一伟大贡献”。
    文章指出，中国文化大革命，是反对资本主义和修正主义斗争中具有重大意义的一次战役，是对全世界帝国主义者和反动派妄想修正主义会在中国得逞的一个致命的打击。
    文章强调指出，“毛泽东思想是中国无产阶级展开文化革命的根本武器。”它说，反动派和帝国主义大事攻击中国的文化大革命，正是这场革命开展得正确而及时的最好证明。
