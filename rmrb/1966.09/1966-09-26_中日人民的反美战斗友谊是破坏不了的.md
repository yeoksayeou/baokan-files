Relevant Chinese people's organizations have separately sent telegrams to support the brave struggle of Japanese youth to strengthen Chinese-Japanese people's friendship.

Red Guards in the capital warn the Sato government to immediately stop the savage suppression of Japanese youth seeking to come to China.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 25th, relevant people's organizations and Red Guards in the capital sent telegrams or letters to relevant organizations in Japan and all Japanese youth preparing to participate in the Second Chinese-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gala. They strongly protested against the Japanese Sato government's actions to sabotage Chinese-Japanese friendly exchanges and brutally obstruct Japanese youth from coming to China for the gala. They also firmly demanded that the Sato government immediately withdraw its unreasonable decision to refuse to issue passports to youth coming to China.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Machinery Industry, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Railway Industry, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Highway Transportation, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Agriculture and Forestry separately sent telegrams to the Central Metal Struggle Conference of Japan, the Central Transportation and Communication Workers' Struggle Conference of Japan, and the Youth Strategy Department of the All-Japan Farmers' Union. They severely condemned the unreasonable actions of the Japanese Sato government. The telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Machinery Industry pointed out that the Japanese Sato government, following the lead of American imperialism, deliberately sabotages the unity and combat friendship of Chinese and Japanese youth, which completely goes against the interests of the Japanese people and youth. This can only arouse even stronger struggles from the Japanese people and youth. The telegrams from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Railway Industry and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Highway Transportation expressed high respect and firm support for the brave and unyielding struggle of Japanese youth to strengthen Chinese-Japanese people's friendship. The telegrams expressed the belief that no matter how American imperialism, the Japanese Sato government, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various followers obstruct and sabotage, the combat friendship between the workers and people of the two countries in the struggle against American imperialism is indestructible. The telegram from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Agriculture and Forestry expressed that Chinese agricultural and forestry workers and the Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Japanese people and youth.

The All-China Youth Federation, in a telegram to the Socialist Youth League of Japan, the Youth Strategy Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the Federation of Youth Organizations of Japan, expressed the belief that as long as the brave Japanese youth unite and persist in their struggle, they will surely win the final victory. The All-China Women's Federation, in a telegram to the Women's Congress of Japan, the Housewives' Union of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the Federation of Coal Miners' Wives of Japan, emphasized that the great leader Chairman Mao said: "Those who are determined to be led by the nose by American imperialism will ultimately perish with American imperialism." The Sato government is so insane in sabotaging the friendship between the peoples of the two countries and is willing to be a running dog of American imperialism. They will not have a good ending.

Two thousand Red Guards participating in the Second Chinese-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gala Chorus wrote an open letter to all Japanese youth preparing to come to China for the gala. They sternly warned the Sato government to immediately withdraw its unreasonable decision to refuse to issue passports to Japanese youth and immediately stop the savage suppression of Japanese youth. The letter pointed out that Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The Japanese Sato government will be no exception.

The two thousand Red Guards expressed great admiration for the struggle of Japanese youth against the Sato government and enthusiastically praised their revolutionary rebellion. The letter said, "We Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao's words. We will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, to be promoters of domestic revolution and promoters of world revolution. We Red Guards will never forget that today, three-quarters of the world's people are still not liberated. We will definitely, with a high sense of proletarian internationalism, support the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people and youth."

    中日人民的反美战斗友谊是破坏不了的
    我国各有关人民团体分别致电支持日本青年加强中日人民友好的英勇斗争
    首都红卫兵小将警告佐藤政府立即停止对争取来华的日本青年的野蛮镇压
    据新华社二十五日讯  我国的有关人民团体和首都红卫兵小将，今天和昨天分别打电报或写信给日本的有关团体以及准备参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢的全体日本青年，强烈抗议日本佐藤政府破坏中日友好往来，粗暴阻挠日本青年来华联欢的卑鄙行径，并且坚决要求佐藤政府立即撤回拒发来华青年护照的无理决定。
    中国机械工会全国委员会、中国铁路工会全国委员会和中国公路运输工会全国委员会、中国农林工会全国委员会，分别打电报给日本中央金属共斗会议、日本交通运输工会共斗会议以及全日本农民协会联合会青年对策部，严厉谴责日本佐藤政府的无理行径。中国机械工会全国委员会的电报中指出，日本佐藤政府追随美帝国主义，蓄意破坏中日青年的团结和战斗友谊，是完全违背日本人民和青年的利益的，这只能激起日本人民和青年更加强烈的斗争。中国铁路工会全国委员会和中国公路运输工会全国委员会在电报中，对日本广大青年为了加强中日人民友好所进行的英勇不屈的斗争，表示崇高的敬意和坚决的支持。电报中表示坚信，不管美帝国主义、日本佐藤政府、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者怎样阻挠和破坏，中日两国工人和人民在反对美帝国主义斗争中所结成的战斗友谊是破坏不了的。中国农林工会全国委员会的电报表示，中国农林工人和中国人民坚决支持日本人民和青年的正义斗争。
    中华全国青年联合会在致日本社会主义青年同盟、日本总评青年对策部和日本青年团协议会的电报中表示相信，英勇的日本青年只要团结一致，坚持斗争，就一定能赢得最后的胜利。全国妇联在致日本妇女会议、总评主妇会和日本煤矿主妇协议会的电报中强调指出，伟大领袖毛主席说：“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”佐藤政府如此丧心病狂地破坏中日两国人民友谊，甘心充当美帝国主义的走狗，它们决不会有好下场的。
    首都参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢合唱队的两千名红卫兵小将们，昨天给准备来我国联欢的全体日本青年写了公开信，严正警告佐藤政府必须立即撤回拒发日本青年护照的无理决定，立即停止对日本青年的野蛮镇压。信中指出，毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”日本佐藤政府也决不会例外。
    两千名红卫兵小将对日本青年与佐藤政府进行斗争表示十分钦佩，并且热烈赞扬他们的革命造反行动好得很。信中说，我们红卫兵战士最听毛主席的话。我们永远记住毛主席的教导，既要做国内革命的促进派，也要做世界革命的促进派。我们红卫兵战士永远不会忘记今天世界上还有三分之二的人民没有解放。我们一定以高度的无产阶级国际主义精神，支持日本人民和青年的革命斗争。
