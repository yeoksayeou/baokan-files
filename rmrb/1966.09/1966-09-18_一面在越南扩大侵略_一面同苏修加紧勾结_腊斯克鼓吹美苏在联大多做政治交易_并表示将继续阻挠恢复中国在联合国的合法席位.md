While expanding aggression in Vietnam, the United States is also intensifying its collusion with Soviet revisionists. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk advocates for political deals between the U.S. and the Soviet Union at the upcoming UN General Assembly and expresses that the U.S. will continue to obstruct the restoration of China's lawful seat in the United Nations.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 17th: Washington reports that on the 16th, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk stated at a press conference that the United States intends to use the 21st session of the United Nations General Assembly, which will open on the 20th, as a venue for political deals between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Rusk advocates that the U.S. and the Soviet Union should "concentrate their efforts on preventing the further proliferation of nuclear weapons" during this session of the United Nations General Assembly. He also said that the U.S. hopes that the discussions on this issue at the United Nations General Assembly this year will "make progress." Rusk further revealed that the detailed discussions on disarmament between the U.S. and the Soviet Union at the 17-nation disarmament conference in Geneva were "very worthwhile." He said that these issues will be "further discussed in detail at the United Nations General Assembly." He also mentioned that the U.S. hopes to make some progress in signing a "comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty" and discussing certain "disarmament" measures, and that the U.S. hopes the two countries can sign a "space treaty."

Rusk made it clear that the U.S. will once again vigorously stir up an anti-China wave at this session of the General Assembly to obstruct the restoration of China's lawful seat in the United Nations. He emphasized that the U.S.'s stance against restoring China's lawful seat has not changed, and that the U.S. "often maintains contact with the governments of UN member states on this matter and will continue to do so during the session."

When discussing the Vietnam issue, Rusk once again played the "peace talks" trick and praised the actions of Philippine President Marcos, who is currently visiting the U.S. and serving U.S. interests. Under U.S. instructions, Marcos proposed a "suggestion" to establish a so-called "Asian political institution" to discuss issues such as Vietnam. He also said that efforts should be made to have the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the puppet regime in South Vietnam "make contact with each other" as a step towards a "negotiated solution" to the Vietnam problem.

    一面在越南扩大侵略　一面同苏修加紧勾结
    腊斯克鼓吹美苏在联大多做政治交易
    并表示将继续阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法席位
    据新华社十七日讯华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克十六日在记者招待会上表示，美国要利用将在二十日开幕的联合国大会第二十一届会议作为美苏两国进行政治交易的场所。
    腊斯克鼓吹美苏两国在这届联合国大会期间要“集中力量来解决防止进一步扩散核武器的问题”，并且说美国希望联合国大会今年对这个问题的讨论将会“取得进展”。腊斯克还透露，美苏两国在日内瓦十七国裁军会议上就裁军问题在“幕后进行的详细讨论是十分值得的”。他说，在联合国大会上“将进一步详细讨论原来在日内瓦会议上要讨论的那些问题”。他还说，美国希望美苏两国在签订一项“全面禁止（核）试验条约方面”和讨论某些“裁军”措施方面“取得某种进展”，美国希望两国“能够签订一项空间条约”。
    腊斯克表明，美国在这一届联大会议上将再一次竭力掀起反华浪潮，阻挠恢复中国在联合国中的合法席位。他强调，美国反对恢复中国合法席位的立场并没有改变，美国“经常就这件事同联合国会员国政府保持联系，并将在大会进行期间同它们进一步联系。”
    腊斯克在谈到越南问题时再一次玩弄“和谈”骗局，对目前正在访问美国的菲律宾总统马科斯为美国骗局效劳的行径大加称赞。马科斯在美国的指使下曾经提出“建议”，鼓吹成立一个讨论越南等问题的所谓“亚洲政治机构”，并且说什么要设法使越南民主共和国同南越傀儡政权“相互接触”，作为走向越南问题“谈判解决”的一步。
