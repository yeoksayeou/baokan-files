Japanese friends have boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tokyo on September 3, Japanese friends have boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Japanese figure Sumikō Takaharu, at a welcoming meeting for the Chinese Youth Delegation in Yamaguchi Prefecture, said, "Mao Zedong Thought has reached the brilliant heights of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. This thought and theory have become the guiding light for the Chinese people and the people of the world."

Sumikō said, "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are the most reliable friends of the Japanese people and the people of the world. China is the most reliable revolutionary base."

A young woman from Shizuoka Prefecture, Naoye Uchiyama, said, "Chairman Mao is the golden red sun." She said, "Whenever I encounter difficulties, I take out the photo of Chairman Mao receiving us and look at it. This way, we gain courage and boundless strength."

Researcher at the Japan Asia-Africa Research Institute, Katō Nagao, said, "Chairman Mao Zedong has summarized the contemporary people's struggle experience, raised it to the theoretical level, proposed guidelines, and systematized it, thereby developing the doctrines of Marx and Lenin."

He said, "Chairman Mao's works are weapons of struggle," "The great significance of Chairman Mao's works will be understood by more and more people. The more the people of the world understand Chairman Mao's works, the more their revolutionary struggle will develop."

A Japanese friend from Yamaguchi Prefecture told the Chinese Youth Delegation, "Someone officially notified us to remove the hanging portrait of Chairman Mao, but we did not comply. Instead, we hung the portrait of our most respected Chairman Mao even higher."

A young man from Kobe named Kiyomizu Keihō said, "I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and be a good child of Chairman Mao."

Many Japanese friends told the Chinese Youth Delegation: They are currently studying Chairman Mao's essay "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." They said, "No matter what situation arises, the hearts of the revolutionary people and youth of Japan will forever be with the great leader Mao Zedong, whom the world's revolutionary people respect, and the glorious Communist Party of China."

    日本朋友无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想
    据新华社东京三日电  日本朋友无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想。
    日本人士隅冈隆春在山口县欢迎中国青年代表团的集会上发表讲话说，“毛泽东思想达到了当代马克思列宁主义顶峰的光辉境地。这一思想和理论成为中国人民和世界人民的指路明灯。”
    隅冈说，“在毛泽东思想指引下的中国共产党和中国人民，是日本人民以及全世界人民最可靠的朋友，中国是最可靠的革命根据地。”
    静冈县一位女青年内山正江说，“毛主席是金色的红太阳。”她说，“在我每当遇到困难的时候，就拿出毛主席接见我们时的照片看，这样，我们就增加了勇气和无限的力量。”
    日本亚非研究所研究员加藤长雄说，“毛泽东主席总结了当代的人民斗争经验，把它提高到理论上来，提出方针，并加以系统化，从而发展了马克思、列宁的学说。”
    他说：“毛主席的著作是斗争武器”，“毛主席著作的伟大意义将被越来越多的人所理解，世界人民越来越理解毛主席著作，他们的革命斗争也就越来越发展”。
    山口县一位日本朋友对中国青年代表团说，有人正式通知他们要撤下悬挂着的毛主席像，他说：“我们没有照办，我们反而高高挂起了我们最敬爱的毛主席像。”
    神户一位叫清水计雄的日本青年说：“我一定要听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，做毛主席的好孩子。”
    许多日本朋友告诉中国青年代表团：他们正在学习毛主席的《愚公移山》一文。他们说，“他们坚信：不管出现什么情况，日本的革命人民和青年的心，将永远向着世界革命人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和光荣的中国共产党。”
