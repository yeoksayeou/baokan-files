The article "Long Live the Victory of People's War" by Comrade Lin Biao has been published for a year. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have been studying it systematically in conjunction with their preparations for war. They are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing political work, and are determined to be both promoters of the domestic revolution and promoters of the international revolution. They are carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death and are determined to make their due contributions to the defeat of American imperialism on a global scale.

	New China News Agency, September 2nd. The article "Long Live the Victory of People's War" by Comrade Lin Biao has been published for a year. The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have all studied it seriously. Many units have organized training classes and study sessions, and have organized corps and division-level cadres to systematically study Mao Zedong's thought on people's war. This has fundamentally strengthened their preparations for anti-aggression warfare. The leading cadres who participated in the study are full of vigor and enthusiasm, and are determined to be both promoters of the domestic revolution and promoters of the international revolution. They are carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death and are determined to make their due contributions to the defeat of American imperialism on a global scale.

	Mao Zedong said: "The issue of mobilizing the military and the people politically is indeed too important." Comrade Lin Biao pointed out that in preparing for anti-American imperialist aggression, the primary task is to prepare Mao Zedong's thought on people's war. The General Political Department, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, has required all units to, since last autumn, in the course of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, make the study of Mao Zedong's thought on people's war and Comrade Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War" a prominent and important topic. They are resolutely implementing the strategic guidelines of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and strengthening preparations for anti-aggression warfare. Over the past year, various units, in accordance with the current domestic and international class struggle situation, their own unit tasks, and the living thoughts of the officers and soldiers, have, in addition to repeatedly organizing the broad masses of officers and soldiers to study seriously, also organized corps and division-level leading cadres to study in short-term off-duty sessions. They have used methods such as studying the original works, opening up their minds, discussing problems, and recalling and comparing, to deeply understand the spirit and tactical principles of Mao Zedong's people's war, and to firmly establish the idea of serving all the people of China and all the people of the world, and to always stand on the front line of the struggle against American imperialist aggression.

	In this in-depth and systematic study, each unit has used Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbook and Comrade Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War" as the outline and thread, and has widely organized discussions. Through study and discussion, the broad masses of cadres have solved the following five problems:

	First, they have further clarified the current situation, tasks, and responsibilities of the world proletarian revolution, and have firmly established the idea of being promoters of the world revolution. Many cadres in the units of Shenyang, Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Jinan, Wuhan, Kunming, and the Air Force, at the beginning of their training, studied Chairman Mao's expositions on the current world's main contradictions, that American imperialism is the main enemy of all the people of the world, that the revolutions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are decisive for the world revolution, and the strategic thoughts of our party on the world revolution. They then used Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new situation and new tasks of the world proletarian revolution, making everyone further realize that the main enemy of the current world revolution is American imperialism, the main force to strike American imperialism is the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the victorious people of China have the responsibility to support the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and oppressed peoples. Supporting the revolutions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is not just a matter of defending the homeland, but a major issue of the world revolution. On this basis, many units further studied Chairman Mao's expositions on how imperialism, upon its birth, connected the affairs of the world, how the proletarian revolutions of various countries and the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of various countries have always been international and mutually supportive, and how China, as a country that has achieved revolutionary victory, should make greater contributions to humanity. Combined with recalling and comparing, they analyzed China's responsibilities towards the world revolution. Everyone further realized that China's revolution also had the aid of the international proletariat, and now the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are supporting us more than we are supporting them. Many cadres in the Nanjing Artillery Corps said passionately in their studies: We should, just as we once regarded the liberated areas as the base for liberating all the people of the country, regard China as the base for the world revolution, and bravely shoulder the heavy burden of the world revolution.

	Second, they have further clarified the nature of American imperialism, and have prepared their minds to face early, large-scale, nuclear, and various types of wars on several fronts. In their studies, everyone used Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on how the nature of imperialism will not change, how the enemy always misjudges the situation, and how one should despise the enemy strategically but take the enemy seriously tactically, to analyze the new trends in American imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy and the development of the Vietnam War. They further clarified that preparing to face the enemy's early, large-scale attacks is both a long-term strategic task and an urgent need of the current situation. Many comrades cited the facts that American imperialism has shifted its strategic focus to Asia, with its spearhead pointed at our country; that it is following the path of "escalation, failure, re-escalation, re-failure" in Vietnam, preparing to expand the flames of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula and our territory; and that modern revisionism is actively collaborating with American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries to establish a counter-revolutionary encirclement against China. These facts show that the possibility of American imperialism launching early, large-scale aggression is not decreasing but increasing. On this basis, everyone further studied Chairman Mao's expositions on how the results of having or not having spiritual preparations for war are greatly different, how preparations should be made earlier rather than later, and how one should consider the worst-case scenario. They studied the attitudes that every revolutionary soldier should have. Many comrades said: Although early, large-scale attacks have two possibilities, only by placing our focus on early, large-scale attacks can we be most secure.

	Third, they have further clarified that people are the decisive factor, and have firmly established the idea of relying on the people to wage people's war. In their studies, everyone used Chairman Mao's thoughts on how the decisive factor in the victory or defeat of a war is people, not things, how the people and the soldiers are the foundation of victory, and how everyone should be a soldier, and Comrade Lin Biao's related expositions as weapons. They deeply discussed the status and role of the masses of people and the militia in modern warfare, and further clarified that modern warfare even more needs to rely on the masses of people and the militia; whether or not to rely on the masses is the fundamental difference between two military lines and two worldviews. Some comrades also voluntarily examined their erroneous ideas of "relying solely on regular troops to fight" and "guerrilla warfare is outdated," pointing out that people's war is the common path for oppressed nations and oppressed peoples to overthrow the rule of imperialism and reactionaries and achieve thorough liberation.

	Fourth, they have deeply understood the essence of Chairman Mao's four sentences: "You fight your way, I fight mine; if you can win, fight; if you can't win, retreat," and have firmly established the idea of fighting annihilation battles. Various units, based on their serious study of Chairman Mao's military works such as "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla Warfare Against Japan," and "On Protracted War," and Comrade Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War," focused on studying the essence of these four sentences. Many comrades felt that the basic spirit of the "four sentences" is to fight annihilation battles on the basis of people's war, to use our strengths to strike the enemy's weaknesses, to seek advantages and avoid disadvantages, and to strive for the initiative. To fight annihilation battles, one must correctly handle the relationships between advancing and retreating, local and overall, gain and loss, temporary and long-term; one must dare to lure the enemy in deep and encircle the enemy; one must not calculate the gain or loss of a city or a piece of land, concentrate forces, and annihilate the enemy's combat effectiveness; one must dare to fight close quarters and night battles, and engage in hand-to-hand combat. In this way, many comrades felt that with the red line of fighting annihilation battles, their understanding of the strategic and tactical thoughts of our great leader would be much deeper.

	Fifth, to carry out the world revolution, one must first emphasize politics and carry out the ideological transformation of the people. Many leading cadres said: To be a world revolutionary, to implement Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thoughts on people's war, without courage, without the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, nothing can be achieved. They once again studied Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao's expositions on military construction emphasizing politics and wholeheartedly serving the people, and studied the heroic deeds of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Mai Xiande, Jiao Yulu, and Liu Yingjun. Through activities such as "recalling the past and comparing with heroes," they deeply examined their non-proletarian thoughts, and were determined to take the liberation of all the people of the world as their mission, to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, to break private interests and establish public interests, to firmly establish the heroic spirit of daring to revolutionize, daring to struggle, living to fight, and dying to be counted, and to carry the struggle against American imperialism to the end.

	The study of Mao Zedong's thought on people's war has brought about a great change in the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in the entire army, especially the leading cadres who have experienced countless battles. Many people said that this study is a study of "receiving the heavy responsibility of the world revolution" and a study of "sharpening the ideological sword." Currently, they are advancing with redoubled confidence, courage, and enthusiasm, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and striving forward for the thorough victory of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

    毛主席人民战争思想武装的军队天下无敌
    林彪同志《人民战争胜利万岁》发表一年来，解放军指战员结合战备进行深入系统的学习。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出政治，决心既当国内革命促进派，又当国际革命促进派，发扬一不怕苦、二不怕死的革命精神，为在全世界范围内打败美帝国主义作出应有的贡献。
    新华社二日讯　林彪同志《人民战争胜利万岁》的文章发表一年来，中国人民解放军广大指战员都认真进行了学习，许多部队举办集训班、读书班，组织师团以上干部，深入系统地学习毛主席人民战争思想，从根本上加强了反侵略战争的准备。参加学习的领导干部们，意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心既当国内革命促进派，又当国际革命促进派，发扬一不怕苦、二不怕死的革命精神，为在全世界范围内打败美帝国主义作出应有的贡献。
    毛主席说：“政治上动员军民的问题，实在太重要了。”林彪同志指出，反对美帝国主义侵略的战争准备中，首要的是毛主席人民战争思想的准备。总政治部根据毛主席的教导和林彪同志的指示，要求各部队从去年秋季起在活学活用毛主席著作中，把学习毛主席的人民战争思想，学习林彪同志的《人民战争胜利万岁》，作为突出的重要课题，坚决贯彻执行党中央和毛主席的战略方针，加强反侵略战争的准备。一年来，各部队根据当前国内外阶级斗争形势、本部队任务和指战员的活思想，除了反复组织广大指战员认真学习外，许多单位又分别分批地集中了团以上领导干部短期离职学习，让他们通过学原著、敞思想、摆问题和回忆对比等方法，深刻领会毛主席人民战争的精神实质和战略战术原则，牢固地树立为全中国人民和全世界人民服务的思想，永远站在反对美帝国主义侵略斗争的第一线。
    在这次深入系统的学习中，各单位都以毛主席著作为基本教材，以林彪同志的《人民战争胜利万岁》为提纲和线索，广泛组织讨论，通过学习和讨论，广大干部解决了以下五个问题：
    第一、进一步认清当前无产阶级世界革命形势、任务和我们的责任，牢固地树立当世界革命促进派的思想。沈阳、北京、广州、南京、济南、武汉、昆明和空军等部队的许多干部在集训时，一开始学习了毛主席关于当前世界的主要矛盾，美帝国主义是全世界人民的主要敌人，亚、非、拉革命对世界革命有决定意义和我党对世界革命的战略思想等论述，然后运用毛主席的思想分析了无产阶级世界革命的新形势和新任务，使大家进一步认识到：当前世界革命的主要敌人是美帝国主义，打击美帝的主要力量是亚、非、拉人民的革命斗争，胜利了的中国人民，有责任支援被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争。支援亚、非、拉革命不只是保家卫国的问题，而是世界革命的大问题，从而自觉地把自己的工作与世界革命挂上了钩。许多单位在这个基础上，又进一步学习了毛主席关于帝国主义一出世就把世界的事情联成一气的论述，各国无产阶级革命、各国人民反帝斗争从来就是国际性的相互支援的论述，中国是取得革命胜利的大国应对人类有较大贡献的论述等；结合回忆对比，分析中国对世界革命的责任。大家进一步认识到，中国的革命也有国际无产阶级的援助，现在亚、非、拉人民对我们的支援比我们支援他们的多。南京炮兵部队许多干部在学习中满怀激情地说：我们应当像过去把解放区看成是解放全国人民的根据地一样，把中国看成是世界革命的根据地，勇敢地挑起世界革命的重担。
    第二、进一步认清美帝国主义本性，树立了对付早打、大打、打核战争、打各种战争、在几条战线上打的思想准备。在学习时，大家都以毛主席关于帝国主义本性不会改变、敌人总是错误估计形势、在战略上藐视敌人战术上重视敌人等光辉思想，来分析美帝国主义反革命全球战略的新动向和越南战争的发展趋势，进一步明确了：准备对付敌人的早打、大打既是长期的战略任务，又是当前形势的迫切需要。许多同志列举美帝国主义把它的战略重点转到亚洲，矛头指向我国；它在越南正按照“升级、失败，再升级、再失败”的路子走下去，准备把侵略战火扩大到整个印度支那和我国土地上，现代修正主义也正在积极配合美帝国主义和各国反动派，建立一个针对中国的反革命包围圈等事实，说明当前美帝国主义冒险发动早打、大打的可能性不是减少了，而是增加了。在这个基础上，大家又学习了毛主席关于对战争有无精神准备结果大不相同、准备宁肯失之过早不可失之过迟、要把问题放在最坏的基点来考虑等论述，研究每个革命战士应有的态度。许多同志说：早打、大打虽然有两方面的可能性，但是只有把立足点放在早打、大打上，才最牢靠。
    第三、进一步认清人的因素第一，牢固地树立依靠人民，进行人民战争的思想。在学习中，大家都以毛主席关于战争胜负的决定因素是人不是物、兵民是胜利之本、全民皆兵等思想和林彪同志的有关论述为武器，深入讨论了现代化战争中人民群众、民兵的地位和作用，进一步明确了：现代化战争更需要依靠人民群众和民兵；要不要依靠群众，这是两条军事路线、两种世界观的根本分歧。有的同志还自觉地检查了“单纯依靠正规军打仗”、“游击战过时”等错误想法，指出：人民战争是被压迫民族、被压迫人民推翻帝国主义和反动派的统治，彻底解放自己的共同道路。
    第四、深刻领会了毛主席关于“你打你的，我打我的；打得赢就打，打不赢就走”四句话的精神实质，牢固地树立打歼灭战的思想。各单位在认真学习毛主席《中国革命战争的战略问题》《抗日游击战争的战略问题》《论持久战》等军事著作和林彪同志《人民战争胜利万岁》的基础上，着重研究了毛主席这四句话的精神实质。许多同志体会到：“四句话”的基本精神就是在人民战争的基础上打歼灭战，以我之长，击敌之短，趋利避害，力争主动。而要打歼灭战就要正确处理走和打、局部和全局、得和失、暂时和长远等关系；就要敢于诱敌深入，迂回包围敌人；就要不计一城一地的得失，集中兵力，歼灭敌人有生力量；就要敢于近战、夜战，刺刀见红。这样，许多同志便感到：有了打歼灭战这条红线，对我们伟大领袖的战略战术思想的领会就深刻得多了。
    第五、要搞世界革命，必须首先突出政治，搞好人的思想革命化。许多领导干部说：要做世界革命派，实行毛主席人民战争的战略战术，离开勇敢，离开一不怕苦、二不怕死的革命精神，什么也办不到，他们再次学习了毛主席和林彪同志关于军队建设要突出政治和全心全意为人民服务的论述，学习了雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得、焦裕禄、刘英俊等英雄事迹，并通过“忆过去，比英雄”等活动，深刻地检查了自己的非无产阶级思想，决心以解放全世界人民为己任，彻底灭资兴无，破私立公，牢固地树立敢于革命，敢于斗争，活着就干，死了就算的英雄气概，把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
    毛主席人民战争思想的学习，使全军广大指战员，特别是身经百战的领导干部精神面貌发生了巨大变化，许多人说这次学习是“领受了世界革命的重任”的学习，是“磨思想上的刀”的学习。目前他们正以百倍的信心，百倍的勇气，百倍的干劲，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为中国革命和世界革命的彻底胜利而奋勇前进。
