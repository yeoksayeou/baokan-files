Chairman Mao's book is red and shiny, every word and sentence is truth, every page and line is like a gentle spring breeze. On the training ground, reading a passage stirs up the winds of the five continents in one's chest; hatred gathers at the tip of the blade, and the battle cries shake the mountains! On a thousand-mile march, reading a passage stirs up revolutionary passion in one's heart; songs echo through the steep peaks and dangerous paths, forging a pair of iron feet! In production and labor, reading a passage transforms barren hills and wilderness; silver hoes and iron shovels dance in one's hands, never forgetting "Nanyuan." Carrying a section of "Quotations" on patrol, a light is lit in one's heart; no matter how cunning the bandits are, they cannot escape from these eyes! Under the dim oil lamp, studying "Quotations," remembering hardship and simplicity in one's heart; mending shoes and socks oneself, mending clothes with one's own hands...

Reading and using it every day, the soldier's will is firmer than steel; eliminating the bourgeoisie and promoting the proletariat in the revolution, youthful vigor illuminates the sky!

    毛主席的书金灿灿
    解放军某部战士　吕林清毛主席的书啊，红彤彤，金灿灿，字字句句是真理，页页行行春风漫。练兵场上读一段，五洲风云涌胸间；仇恨聚在刀尖上，杀声震得山打颤！千里野营读一段，革命豪情心头翻；奇峰险道歌声响，练出一双铁脚板！生产劳动读一段，荒山野岭换容颜；银锄铁锨手中舞，世代不忘“南泥湾”。背段“语录”去巡逻，心头点亮灯一盏；任你强盗再狡猾，难逃咱这一双眼！小油灯下学“语录”，艰苦朴素记心坎；鞋袜破了自己补，衣衫破了亲手连……天天读呵天天用，战士意志比钢坚；灭资兴无干革命，青春似火映红天！
