In recent years, the textile industry has increasingly used synthetic fibers as raw materials. Synthetic fiber fabrics require high-temperature setting, necessitating the use of heat setting equipment. In 1964, the Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory encountered this contradiction: they had received a large order for wool-polyester blends but lacked a heat setting machine for processing.

A heat setting machine is a massive piece of equipment that was previously imported and very expensive. The workers of this factory formed a "three-in-one" team, analyzed the imported heat setting machines from sister units, and based on China's actual conditions, boldly innovated and forged their own path. After two months of hard work, they successfully designed and manufactured a new type of heat setting machine. Its production effect is basically the same as that of imported equipment. However, it is much cheaper, with the cost being only about one-tenth of the imported heat setting machine.

Later, the Shanghai New Light Underwear Factory learned from this experience and also independently developed a heat setting machine, with an even lower cost.

   热定型机
    这几年，纺织工业生产上越来越多地采用合成纤维作原料。合成纤维织物需要进行高温定型，一定要有热定型设备。天津市织染厂在一九六四年就遇到了这个矛盾：接了大批毛涤纶的定货，却没有热定型机加工。
    热定型机是一个庞然大物，以前是进口的，很贵。
    这个厂的职工，组成了三结合的队伍，分析了兄弟单位进口的热定型机，从我国的实际情况出发，大胆创造，走自己的路。经过两个月的苦战，很快就设计、制造成功了一台新型的热定型机。它的生产效果，和进口设备基本相同。但是它价格便宜，造价只相当于进口热定型机的十分之一左右。
    后来，上海新光内衣厂吸收了这一经验，也自力更生搞了一台，造价更为低廉。
