The Sato Government in Japan is Rotten to the Core

The Sato government in Japan recently prohibited Japanese youth from coming to China to participate in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering. This is yet another anti-China crime it has committed, once again exposing its hostile attitude towards China and its willingness to act as a lackey of the United States.

A Henchman of U.S. Imperialism's Aggression in Asia

Chairman Mao said, "The greatest imperialist in the world today is U.S. imperialism, which has its lackeys in many countries." The Japanese government led by Prime Minister Sato Eisaku is a lackey of U.S. imperialism in Japan. It represents the interests of Japanese pro-American monopolistic capital and militaristic warlords. Since it came to power in November 1964, it has done many evil things and is the most reactionary government in Japan since the end of World War II.

The Sato government supports U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, acting as a henchman in U.S. imperialism's aggression against Asia. It actively assists the United States in its aggression against Vietnam. The more than 200 U.S. military bases in Japan, as well as the Japanese island of Okinawa, are important bases for U.S. aggression against Vietnam. Japan has manufactured a large number of weapons and war materials, supplying the U.S. invading army and the puppet army in South Vietnam. The Sato government also forces a large number of Japanese people to do logistics work for the U.S. invading army.

The Sato government is also very enthusiastic about the U.S.'s "peace talks" conspiracy. Whenever the U.S. proposes some "peace talks" trick, the Sato government immediately comes out to support it. It has done this several times in collusion with the Soviet revisionist leadership, acting as a go-between for the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Recently, the Sato government has also helped the U.S. suppress the people of Thailand, sending two so-called "mobile medical teams" to northeastern Thailand, and helping the U.S. build military bases in Thailand, selling weapons to the Thai reactionaries.

The Vanguard of the Anti-China Alliance

The Sato government is extremely hostile towards China. It has colluded with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to form an anti-China alliance. As soon as the Sato government came to power, it attacked China's nuclear tests, opposed the restoration of China's lawful rights in the United Nations, and opposed the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the United Nations. It also tried to claim that Taiwan is not Chinese territory, fully exposing the ambitions of Japanese militaristic forces towards Taiwan. On the Vietnam issue and Sino-Japanese relations, the Sato government has repeatedly attacked and slandered China, acting very arrogantly. In addition, it has repeatedly sabotaged friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan.

The Sato government actively cooperates with the U.S. in its conspiracy to encircle China. It has close relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Last year, under U.S. instructions, it signed the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" with the Park Chung-hee puppet regime in South Korea. These three lackeys have joined forces, actually helping the U.S. to form an East Asian invasion group to encircle China. The Sato government has also prepared plans to cooperate with the U.S. in attacking China, stipulating that if the U.S. goes to war with China, Japan will join the U.S. in sending troops, turning Japan into a base for attacking China. Just look at how arrogant the Sato government is!

In the End, It Will Only Meet Its Doom

Under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, the Sato government is desperately reviving Japanese militarism and expanding the so-called "Self-Defense Forces" of Japan. Now, Japan's army, navy, and air force have expanded to more than 270,000 people, with more than 1,000 aircraft and more than 100,000 tons of naval vessels. Some high-ranking officials of the Sato government now openly say that if something happens in Asia, Japan will send troops abroad. The Japanese militaristic forces, relying on the support of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, think they have grown strong again and want to cause trouble.

However, the Sato government, like U.S. imperialism, is just a paper tiger. U.S. imperialism is nothing to be afraid of, modern revisionism is nothing to be afraid of, and adding a Japanese reactionary is nothing to be afraid of. Everyone knows that Japanese imperialism was originally defeated by the Chinese people. If the Sato government dares to cause trouble following U.S. imperialism, then, as Chairman Mao said, "Those who are determined to be led by the nose by U.S. imperialism will in the end only meet their doom at the hands of U.S. imperialism."

### 日本佐藤政府坏透了

专栏：时事讲话

    日本佐藤政府坏透了
    日本佐藤政府最近不许日本青年到中国来参加中日青年友好大联欢。这是它干下的又一桩反华罪行，再一次暴露了它敌视中国和甘心充当美国走狗的反动面目。
    美帝侵略亚洲的帮凶
    毛主席说，“当前世界上最大的帝国主义是美帝国主义，在很多国家有它的走狗。”由佐藤荣作担任首相的日本政府，就是美帝国主义在日本的走狗。它代表着日本亲美垄断资本和军国主义军阀的利益，从一九六四年十一月上台以来，干了许多坏事，是第二次世界大战以后日本最反动的政府。
    佐藤政府支持美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，充当美帝国主义侵略亚洲的帮凶。它积极帮助美国侵略越南。美国在日本的两百多个军事基地，以及日本的冲绳岛，更是美国侵略越南的重要基地。日本制造了大批武器和作战物资，供给美国侵略军和南越伪军。佐藤政府还驱使一大批日本人给美国侵略军做后勤工作。
    佐藤政府对于美国的“和谈”阴谋也非常卖力。美国每次提出什么“和平谈判”的鬼花招，佐藤政府马上就出来帮腔。它为这件事好几次同苏联修正主义领导集团勾勾搭搭，给美国和苏联牵线搭桥。
    最近，佐藤政府又帮着美国镇压泰国人民，派了两个所谓“流动医疗队”到泰国东北部去，还给美国在泰国修建军事基地，把武器卖给泰国反动派。
    反华同盟里的急先锋
    佐藤政府十分仇视中国。它同美帝国主义、苏联修正主义勾结成了一个反华同盟。佐藤政府一上台，就攻击中国的核爆炸，反对恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，反对把蒋匪帮赶出联合国。它还想把台湾说成不是中国的领土，彻底暴露了日本军国主义势力对台湾的野心。在越南问题和中日关系问题上，佐藤政府也不断攻击污蔑中国，气焰非常嚣张。此外，它还一再破坏中日两国人民的友好往来。
    佐藤政府积极配合美国包围中国的阴谋。它同蒋匪帮的关系本来就很密切。去年它又在美国指使下，同南朝鲜的朴正熙傀儡集团签订了“日韩条约”。这三条走狗捏到一起，实际上帮助美国搞成了包围中国的东北亚侵略集团。佐藤政府还准备好了配合美国进攻中国的作战计划，规定美国要是同中国打起仗来，日本要同美国联合出兵，把日本变成攻击中国的基地。大家看看，佐藤政府多么狂妄！
    到头来只能殉葬
    佐藤政府在美帝国主义的扶植下，拚命复活日本军国主义，扩充名义上叫做“自卫队”的日本军队。现在日本的陆海空军已经扩充到了二十七万多人，拥有一千多架飞机，十多万吨海军舰艇。佐藤政府的一些高级官员，现在公然说，亚洲要是出了什么事情，日本就要派兵出国。日本军国主义势力，仗着有美帝国主义和苏联修正主义撑腰，以为自己已经羽毛丰满，又想出来捣乱了。
    但是，佐藤政府同美帝国主义一样，也不过是一只纸老虎。美帝国主义没有什么了不起，现代修正主义没有什么了不起，加上一个日本反动派也没有什么了不起。谁都知道，日本帝国主义本来就是中国人民的手下败将。佐藤政府要是胆敢跟着美帝国主义出来捣乱，那末，正像毛主席所说的，“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”
