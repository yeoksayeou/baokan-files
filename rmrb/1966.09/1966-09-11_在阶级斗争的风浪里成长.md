Our most, most beloved leader Chairman Mao tells us: "The essence of Marxism-Leninism is summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" We must rebel against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes! We must join with workers, peasants, and soldiers to sweep away the "four olds" and establish the "four news," creating a world that is thoroughly red!

Recently, some Red Guards from Beijing Industrial Institute went to several streets in Xicheng District and, together with the revolutionary masses, exposed those old parasites, bloodsuckers, and reactionaries who had long been hiding in the corners, rebelled against them, seized their power, boosted the morale of the proletariat, and crushed the enemy's arrogance.

Learning to Use Chairman Mao's Works in Struggle

In our struggles, we encountered many problems. We brought these problems to the study of Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points," which clarified our direction, found methods, increased our skills, and enhanced our ability to engage in class struggle.

When we first took to the streets to rebel, we were not good at relying on the masses and mobilizing them, feeling like we were fighting alone. At this time, we studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary political task force. ... The Red Army is not just about fighting battles. ... Without propaganda, organization, arming, and building a revolutionary government, fighting battles loses its meaning, and the Red Army loses its purpose." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we Red Guards should be like the Red Army, whether fighting big or small battles, we should have a political purpose. For the past seventeen years, escaped landlords, lawless capitalists, and counter-revolutionaries have been protected by the black gang of the former municipal committee and have been free to roam. Today, we have come to rebel against them!

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we are determined to learn from the PLA comrades, seizing every opportunity to propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the revolutionary masses, studying Chairman Mao's works and the "Sixteen Points" with them, and giving special lectures on class struggle, organizing revolutionary forces among the street residents.

Fighting Together with the Revolutionary Masses

Because we closely united with the revolutionary masses, wherever we went, we received enthusiastic help. Some said: "You have supported us and let us vent our anger. We will firmly be your rear guard." Others said: "You are not familiar with the situation, tell us what materials you need." One resident enthusiastically said: "You stay up all night, truly heartbreaking! You are doing revolution, we cannot be idle, please assign us some work!"

Our propaganda teams, when propagating on the streets, received tea and water from the masses. When holding exhibitions and struggle meetings, the masses helped us prepare. Many workers, cadres, and revolutionary masses actively introduced situations to us. Some people studied battle plans with us, voluntarily organized to monitor reactionaries, and relayed messages, making the Red Guards well-informed and able to grasp the direction of the struggle in a timely manner.

In this class struggle, we deeply felt: only when the people truly rise up will the enemy be defeated. Without mobilizing the masses, we cannot sweep away all ghosts and monsters. Without the masses, the great historical task of destroying the "four olds" and establishing the "four news" cannot be completed.

Struggle with Words is More Powerful than Struggle with Force

"Use struggle with words, not struggle with force," "struggle with words is better than struggle with force!" In our struggles, we studied and applied the "Sixteen Points," further recognizing this point.

Initially, there was debate among us about whether struggle with words or struggle with force was better. Through revolutionary struggle practice, we realized that the truth is in our hands, and struggle with words is more powerful than struggle with force.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters, should be criticized and not allowed to spread freely. However, this criticism should be fully reasoned, analytical, and persuasive..."

Connecting with practical experiences, we deeply felt that only struggle with words, only fully exposing the facts and explaining the reasons, can thoroughly expose the counter-revolutionary nature of the class enemy, and be more conducive to organizing the masses to fight against the enemy. Only struggle with words can expose and disgrace the enemy, overthrow and defeat them, making them never able to rise again.

Struggle with words requires brainpower. To fully expose the reactionary nature of the enemy, we organized exhibitions, displaying the weapons, accounts of rebellion, and gold and silver treasures we seized for public viewing; we also organized propaganda teams to read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with targeted messages. A reactionary wrote malicious words in a photo album: "Everlasting memory... dreaming of the past." He attempted to rebel! We used this specific material to make the masses realize that the class enemy is indeed still around, and their hearts are not dead. We also organized workers to denounce the crimes of lawless capitalists on the spot, engaging in face-to-face struggles with the class enemy. In the struggle, we studied Chairman Mao's works with the masses. Learning and applying what we learned in the struggle, we educated the masses and ourselves in this process, making everyone understand what class oppression is.

In class struggle, we still lack experience. However, we firmly believe: following the teachings of our most, most beloved great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, learning revolution in revolution, learning to swim in swimming, experiencing wind and rain in the masses' revolutionary struggles, and seeing the world, we will definitely achieve victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    在阶级斗争的风浪里成长
    最最敬爱的领袖毛主席告诉我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”我们就是要造资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的反！我们要和工农兵一起，横扫“四旧”，大立“四新”，反出一个通红通红的世界来！
    最近，我们北京工业学院部分红卫兵，来到西城区一些街道，和革命群众一起，把那些长期隐藏在角落里的老寄生虫、吸血鬼、反动分子揪了出来，造了他们的反，专了他们的政，长了无产阶级的志气，灭了敌人的威风。
  在斗争中学用毛主席著作
    我们在斗争中，碰到了不少问题。我们带着这些问题，活学活用毛主席著作，活学活用十六条，使我们明确了方向，找到了方法，增长了才干，提高了阶级斗争的本领。
    开始走上街头造反时，我们还不善于依靠群众，发动群众，有“孤军奋战”的感觉。这时，大家就学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。……红军决不是单纯地打仗的，……离了对群众的宣传、组织、武装和建设革命政权等项目标，就是失去了打仗的意义，也就是失去了红军存在的意义。”按照毛主席的教导，我们红卫兵也应该像红军那样，不论打大仗、小仗，都应该有政治目的。解放十七年来，逃亡地主、不法资本家、反革命分子，在前市委黑帮的庇护下长期逍遥法外。今天，我们来，就是造他们的反来了！
    按照毛主席的教导，我们决心向解放军同志学习，抓紧一切机会向革命群众宣传毛泽东思想，和群众一起学习毛主席著作，学习十六条，大讲特讲阶级斗争，在街道居民中组织革命队伍。
    同革命群众一起战斗
    由于同革命群众紧密结合，我们每到一处，都得到热情帮助。有人说：“你们给我们撑了腰，出了气，我们坚决作你们的后盾。”有的说：“你们情况不熟，要什么材料尽管告诉我们。”有个居民热情地说：“你们整夜不睡，真心疼你们！你们干革命，我们不能闲着，请分配点什么工作吧！”
    我们的宣传队在街头宣传时，群众纷纷送茶送水。要举行展览会、斗争会时，群众和我们一起筹备。许多工人、干部和革命群众，主动给我们介绍情况。有些人和我们一起研究作战方案，自动组织起来监视反动分子，传递消息，使红卫兵消息灵通，及时掌握斗争的动向。
    在这场阶级斗争生活里，我们深深体会：只有人民真正起来，敌人才会倒下去。不把人民群众发动起来，就不能横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。离开了人民群众，破“四旧”立“四新”的伟大历史任务，就不能胜利完成。
    文斗比武斗更有力量
      “用文斗，不用武斗”，“文斗比武斗好”！我们在斗争中，学习十六条，运用十六条，进一步认识了这一点。
    起初，文斗好还是武斗好，我们中间是有过争论的。经过革命斗争的实践，我们认识到，真理掌握在我们手里，文斗比武斗更有力量。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。但是，这种批判，应该是充分说理的，有分析的，有说服力的……。”
    联系实践的经历，我们深刻体会到，只有文斗，只有充分地揭露事实，讲明道理，才能把阶级敌人的反革命面貌彻底暴露，才有利于更好地组织群众对敌斗争。只有文斗，才能把敌人揭深搞臭，斗垮斗倒，使他们永世不得翻身。
    文斗是要花脑筋的。为了充分揭露敌人的反动本质，我们组织了展览会，把搜查出来的武器、变天账、金银财宝拿出来示众；又组织了宣传队，有针对性地宣读《毛主席语录》。有一个反动分子在照片册上写着这样恶毒的话：“永远的纪念……梦想着过去”。他妄图变天！我们就通过这个具体材料，使群众认识到阶级敌人确实是人还在，心不死。我们还组织工人当场控诉不法资本家的罪行，和阶级敌人展开面对面的斗争。在斗争中，我们和群众一起学习毛主席著作。在斗争中学，学了就用于斗争，就在这中间教育了群众，也教育了我们自己，使大家懂得了什么叫阶级压迫。
    在阶级斗争中，我们还缺乏经验。但是，我们深信：按照我们最最敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅和伟大舵手毛主席的教导，在革命中学习革命，在游泳中学习游泳，在群众的革命斗争中经风雨，见世面，就一定可以取得无产阶级文化大革命的胜利！
