During the fasting period of 1965, Saigu Bu'a, who had just come from the countryside to work as a steel reinforcement worker at the sugar factory construction site in Mali with the help of China, suddenly passed away due to illness while returning home for the festival. When the news reached the construction site, Chinese workers and experts immediately sent someone to Saigu Bu'a's home and also sent condolence money.

At that time, the villagers saw foreigners coming and gathered around to watch. After the Chinese representative explained the purpose of their visit, Saigu Bu'a's mother and the surrounding people were so moved that they shed tears of joy, saying: "In the past, when the French opened the canal, many Malians died, and no one cared. My son worked with you for only a month, and you personally came to comfort us and sent money to us. Our whole family will never forget you." An elderly person also said: "Only the Chinese can do such things, other countries cannot."

    深厚的阶级感情
    一九六五年的斋节，刚从农村来到中国援助马里建设的糖厂工地当钢筋工的赛古布阿，在回家度节时忽然因病去世了。消息传到工地，中国工人和专家立即派人前往赛古布阿的家里，并且送去了抚恤金。
    当时村里看见来了外国人，都来围看。当中国代表说明来意后，赛古布阿的母亲和周围的人都激动得流下热泪说：“过去法国人开渠死了多少马里人，根本无人过问。我儿子在你们那里工作才一个月，你们亲自来慰问，并送钱给我们，我们全家永远不会忘记你们。”一个年老长者也说：“只有中国人才能做出这种事，别的国家不可能。”
