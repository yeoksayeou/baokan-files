Under the personal leadership, care, and guidance of Comrade Lin Biao, the entire army's cadres and soldiers have been learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the midst of struggle, using them in struggle, and focusing on the "use" aspect. They have made the transformation of ideology and worldview the central task, significantly raising proletarian consciousness. Good deeds and exemplary figures have emerged in abundance, and various tasks have achieved greater successes.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on September 28, in the nationwide movement to study Chairman Mao's works, the People's Liberation Army, which has always been at the forefront, has seen even greater developments in recent years. With boundless love and faith in Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have particularly emphasized the "use" aspect in their study of Chairman Mao's works. Throughout the army, a new situation has emerged where everyone learns in struggle, uses in struggle, learns in practice, and uses in practice, focusing on transforming their worldview. This unwavering resolve to truly master Mao Zedong Thought in the midst of class struggle has brought this great mass movement to a new high tide.

The People's Liberation Army's movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works was initiated under the leadership of Comrade Lin Biao, who has been in charge of the Military Commission. It has developed rapidly with each of Comrade Lin Biao's instructions over the years, like a vast flood surging higher and higher. Last year, Comrade Lin Biao, in light of the movement's progress, timely called for the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, especially focusing on the "use" aspect, treating Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives for all army work. This call quickly spread throughout the army, becoming widely known and deeply ingrained. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers unanimously agreed that this was Comrade Lin Biao's best summary of the army's experience in studying Chairman Mao's works over the past few years and the fundamental policy for future study. Everyone said in unison: "Whether we study Chairman Mao's works by focusing on the 'use' aspect and putting them into practice is the fundamental criterion for whether we are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, whether we are truly studying or just pretending to."

Over the past year, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, have been diligently studying and resolutely applying Chairman Mao's works in their struggles against the enemy, political movements, and various tasks, especially in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have been determined to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. They say: "Drums must be beaten on the right spot, and strings must be plucked on the right strings. The effort in studying Chairman Mao's works must be focused on the 'use' aspect." "Learning without application is useless." Because the cadres and soldiers have focused on the "use" aspect, their study has become more solid, their experience richer, and the number of advanced units and individuals has increased. Many units have seen the emergence of "old comrades" leading "new comrades," "new comrades" inspiring "old comrades," higher levels leading lower levels, lower levels inspiring higher levels, headquarters leading regiments, regiments inspiring headquarters, cadres leading families, and families inspiring cadres, creating a lively and vibrant scene. Over the past year, the scale of study, the level of initiative, the solidity of results, and the richness of experience in the entire army have all been unprecedented.

In studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "use" aspect, where exactly is the "use," how to "use," and who leads the masses in "using"? Many units have accumulated some experience over the past year. They say: "There may be thousands of ways to 'use,' but transforming the worldview is the first step. Only by grasping the transformation of the worldview can we say we have grasped the main switch"; "There may be thousands of ways to 'use,' but the most important thing is to use in struggle and use in practice"; "Leaders must be at the forefront of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning first and using first, to truly gain leadership."

"Transforming the worldview is a fundamental transformation." Over the past year, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have achieved more significant results in transforming their worldview than in any previous year. In implementing Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to emphasize politics, in the midst of class struggle, they have further realized that transforming ideology and improving work, transforming the subjective world and the objective world, are interconnected and mutually promoting, inseparable. However, compared to the two, transforming ideology must be placed first. Ideology is the forerunner of action, and transforming ideology is the prerequisite for improving work. If Mao Zedong Thought does not lead in one's mind, it is impossible to emphasize Mao Zedong Thought in actual work. Therefore, studying Chairman Mao's works must focus on the ideological transformation of the people, making the transformation of ideology and worldview the central task.

How to focus on transforming the worldview? The cadres and soldiers' common experience is: First, they must take "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" as their guiding principles, using these three articles as sharp weapons for transforming their worldview.

How to use these three articles well? Everyone believes that one must have a spirit of struggle and self-revolution. They say: The core of transforming the worldview is to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, to overcome the old and establish the new. The struggle between the bourgeois worldview and the proletarian worldview is a life-and-death struggle. Without the pain of ideological struggle, there can be no proletarian consciousness. Unless bourgeois ideology is uprooted to the point of pain, Mao Zedong Thought cannot be deeply ingrained. A certain unit, in a recent meeting of active learners of Chairman Mao's works, summarized the experience: To struggle, one must expose their thoughts. Exposing thoughts must be voluntary and thorough, not only exposing what others know but also what is deeply hidden in one's heart; not only exposing past thoughts but also current ones; not only exposing issues of thought style but also issues of thought consciousness; not only daring to expose in front of a few but also in front of many; not only daring to expose in front of peers but also in front of superiors and subordinates.

Exposing problems is just the beginning of solving them. To thoroughly solve problems, one must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, persist in reading Chairman Mao's works every day, and check one's actions against them every day. Through criticism and struggle, one can decisively eliminate ideological "enemies." In the struggle, one must also follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Battles must be fought one by one, and enemies must be eliminated one by one." Unless "small self" is eliminated in specific issues, "great public" cannot be established step by step.

Chairman Mao said: "Studying Marxism not only involves learning from books but mainly involves learning through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the workers and peasants, to truly learn." Over the past year, the cadres and soldiers have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, going among the people to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, participating in socialist education movements in factories, mines, and people's communes, and engaging in various activities such as political training camps in places with intense class struggle. They have learned living Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthening their class feelings in studying Chairman Mao's works and their initiative in focusing on the "use" aspect; they have received the most profound and practical class education, their love and hate have become clearer, and they hold their rifles more tightly; they have received the most profound and practical education of the people's army, further solidifying their resolve to serve the people wholeheartedly; they have received profound education on the people's war, firming their belief in victory.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, the cadres and soldiers, while studying, have further participated in the struggle, recognizing the arduousness and complexity of class struggle in the ideological realm. Chairman Mao pointed out: To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. Revolutionary classes are like this, and counter-revolutionary classes are also like this. Many cadres and soldiers say: Although they have heard Chairman Mao's teachings before, they did not truly understand them. Now they truly realize: To make a revolution, seize power, and consolidate power, one must not only seize the rifle but also the pen. Therefore, in this struggle, they have all taken up the pen, writing many articles criticizing the bourgeoisie and all ghosts and monsters. They have learned and memorized Chairman Mao's discussions on class struggle, strengthening their class struggle consciousness and firming their stance.

Leaders taking the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the key to promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to develop deeply. Over the past year, various levels of leaders have diligently studied and resolutely applied, which is an important factor in ensuring that this great mass movement in the entire army has entered a new high tide.

How can leaders take the lead in studying and applying, focusing on the "use" aspect? Many leaders' experiences are: First, they must free themselves from the shackles of blind self-satisfaction. According to Chairman Mao's teachings on combining theory with practice, many units' leaders have generally rectified their study style once.

Various levels of leaders have raised their initiative in study, using their model actions and silent commands of self-revolution to inspire the masses to focus on the "use" aspect. In the study process, they continuously set high standards and strict requirements for themselves, daring to "put themselves in" and discuss problems with the masses, learn viewpoints together, practice together, and share experiences together.

Over the past year, with the deepening development of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have achieved unprecedented proletarian consciousness, not seeking fame or wealth, not fearing hardship or death, wholeheartedly serving the people and the revolution. The proletarian worldview has gradually taken root in the minds of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers. Good deeds and exemplary figures have emerged in abundance in the units. Following the good soldiers of Chairman Mao, Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande, this year has seen the emergence of many more good soldiers of Chairman Mao, such as Liu Yingjun, Zhang Chunyu, Wang Yuchang, and He Xiangkui. Tens of thousands of old cadres who have participated in the revolution for decades have also decided to "work while alive and rest while dead," dedicating their lives to the revolution, studying Chairman Mao's works, transforming their thoughts, and forever maintaining proletarian revolutionary integrity. Everyone says: This year has been a year of deeper, more solid, and more effective study of Chairman Mao's works in our units, and also a year of greater achievements in various tasks.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee states: "Comrade Lin Biao calls on the People's Liberation Army to launch a mass movement to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong throughout the army, setting a brilliant example for the entire Party and the nation." All cadres and soldiers are determined not to disappoint the Party and the people, to adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, to grasp it more tightly, to implement it more thoroughly, to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to forever emphasize proletarian politics, to forever maintain vigorous revolutionary spirit, and to truly make our army a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远突出无产阶级政治，永远保持旺盛革命干劲
    解放军活学活用毛主席著作出现新高潮新局面
    在林彪同志亲自领导、亲切关怀、不断指引下，全军干部战士到斗争中学，在斗争中用，在“用”字上狠下功夫，把改造思想、改造世界观当作中心环节，无产阶级觉悟空前提高，好人好事层出不穷，英雄模范不断涌现，各项工作取得更大的成就。
    据新华社二十八日讯　在全国大学毛主席著作的群众运动中，始终走在运动前列的中国人民解放军，近年来，活学活用毛主席著作又有了更新更大的发展。广大指战员怀着对毛主席无限热爱、对毛泽东思想无限信仰的心情，在学习毛主席著作中，特别重视在“用”字上狠下功夫。全军上下，出现了到斗争中学，在斗争中用，到实践中学，在实践中用，在世界观改造上狠下功夫的新局面。这种在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，人人要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来的坚强意志，使这一伟大的群众运动，又进入了一个新的高潮。
    人民解放军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，是林彪同志主持军委工作以来，亲自领导下开展起来的。它随着林彪同志历年来一次又一次的指示，步步深入，迅猛发展，像巨大的洪流，一浪高过一浪。去年，林彪同志根据运动的发展状况，非常适时地发出了活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫，把毛主席的书当作我们全军各项工作最高指示的号召。这一号召，迅速传遍全军，很快家喻户晓，深入人心。广大指战员一致认为，这是林彪同志对全军几年来活学活用毛主席著作经验的最好概括，也是今后学习毛主席著作的根本方针。大家异口同声地说：“学习毛主席著作是否在‘用’字上狠下功夫，身体力行，是衡量我们是否忠于毛泽东思想，是真学还是假学的根本标志。”
    一年来，广大指战员根据林彪同志的指示，在对敌斗争、政治运动和各项工作中，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，抱着一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手的决心，勤奋地学，坚决地用。他们说：“打鼓要打在点上，弹琴要弹在弦上，学习毛主席著作，功夫一定要下在‘用’字上。”“学了就用处处行，光学不用等于零。”由于指战员们在“用”字上狠下功夫，学习成果越来越扎实，学习经验越来越丰富，先进单位和先进人物也越来越多。许多部队出现了“老将”带“小将”，“小将”促“老将”，上级带下级，下级促上级，机关带连队，连队促机关，干部带家属，家属促干部的生动活泼的景象。一年来，全军学习规模之大，自觉性之高，成果之实，经验之丰富都是前所未有的。
    活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，究竟“用”在哪里？怎样去“用”？谁带领广大群众“用”？许多部队经过一年来的实践，都积累了一些经验。他们说：“用”，尽管有千条万条，但世界观改造是第一条，只有狠抓了世界观的改造，才算“抓住了总开关”；怎样“用”，尽管也有千条万条，但是最重要的是到斗争中用，到实践中用；领导干部是活学活用毛主席著作的带头人，必须学在前，用在先，才能取得真正的领导权。
    “世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。过去一年里，广大指战员在世界观的改造上取得了比以往任何一年更为显著的成效。他们在贯彻执行林彪同志突出政治的指示中，在阶级斗争中，进一步认识到：改造思想和改进工作，改造主观世界和改造客观世界是互相联系、互相促进，不可分离的。但是，两者比较起来，必须把改造思想放在第一位。思想是行动的先导，改造思想是改进工作的前提。如果头脑里不是毛泽东思想挂帅，在实际工作中就不可能突出毛泽东思想。因此，学习毛主席著作，一定要狠抓人的思想革命化，把改造思想、改造世界观当作中心环节。
    怎样狠抓世界观的改造？指战员们的共同体会是：首先要把《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》当作座右铭，把这三篇文章作为改造世界观的锐利武器。
    怎样才能把这三篇文章用好？大家认为，必须有斗争精神，有自我革命精神。他们说：改造世界观的核心，是破私立公，破旧立新。资产阶级世界观同无产阶级世界观的斗争，是你死我活的斗争，不经过思想斗争的痛苦，换不来无产阶级的觉悟，不把资产阶级思想挖到疼处，毛泽东思想就扎不到深处。某部在最近召开的学习毛主席著作积极分子会议上，总结的经验是：要斗争，就要亮思想。亮思想要自觉要彻底，不仅要亮别人知道的，还要亮内心深处别人不知道的；不仅要亮过去的，还要亮当前的；不仅要亮思想作风问题，还要亮思想意识问题；不仅在少数人面前敢亮，在多数人面前也敢亮；不仅在同级面前敢亮，在上级和下级面前也敢亮。
  　亮出了问题，只是解决的开始，要彻底解决问题必须以毛泽东思想为武器，坚持天天读毛主席著作，天天对照检查自己的言行，通过批判斗争，才能把思想“敌人”坚决歼灭掉。在斗争中，还必须遵循毛主席的教导：“打仗只能一仗一仗地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭。”不在一个一个具体问题上消灭“小我”，就不能一步一步立起“大公”。
    毛主席说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”一年来，指战员们遵循毛主席的教导，到人民群众中去宣传毛泽东思想，到工矿企业、人民公社参加社会主义教育运动，到阶级斗争激烈的地方进行政治野营等各种活动，学到了活的毛泽东思想，进一步增强了学习毛主席著作的阶级感情和在“用”字上狠下功夫的自觉性；受到了最深刻、最实际的阶级教育，爱憎更加分明，枪杆子握得更紧；受到最深刻、最实际的人民军队教育，进一步坚定了全心全意为人民服务的思想；受到了深刻的人民战争思想教育，坚定了必胜信心。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，指战员们边学习边参加斗争，又进一步认识到意识形态领域里的阶级斗争的艰巨性复杂性。毛主席指出：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。许多指战员说：过去虽然也听过毛主席这个教导，但没有真正领会。现在才真正体会到：干革命夺取政权、巩固政权，不但要抓枪杆子，也要抓笔杆子。因此，他们在这场斗争中，纷纷拿起笔杆子，写了许多批判资产阶级和一切牛鬼蛇神的文章。他们把毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述，学活了，记牢了，阶级斗争观念更强了，立场更坚定了。
    领导干部带头学，带头用，是促进活学活用毛主席著作群众运动深入发展的关键。各级领导干部在最近一年来，勤奋地学，坚决地用，是保证全军这一伟大的群众运动进入新的高潮的一个重要因素。
    领导干部怎样才能带头学，带头用，在“用”字上狠下功夫？许多领导干部的体会是：首先要把自己从盲目自满的思想束缚中解放出来。按照毛主席关于理论与实际相结合的教导，许多单位的领导较为普遍地整顿了一次学风。
    各级领导干部学习自觉性提高了，纷纷以自己的模范行动，以自觉革命的“无声命令”，来带动广大群众在“用”字上狠下功夫。他们在学习过程中，不断对自己提出高标准、严要求，敢于把自己“摆进去”，和群众一同摆问题，一同学观点，一同去实践，一同谈体会。
    一年来，随着活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的深入发展，广大指战员无产阶级觉悟空前提高，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为人民，一心为革命的无产阶级世界观，在广大干部战士脑海里逐步扎下了根。部队中好人好事层出不穷，英雄模范不断涌现，继雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得等毛主席的好战士之后，今年又出现了刘英俊、张春玉、王裕昌、贺相魁等许许多多毛主席的好战士。千万个参加革命几十年的老干部，也都年老不服老，决心“活着就干，死了就算”，干一辈子革命，学一辈子毛主席著作，改造一辈子思想，永远保持无产阶级的革命晚节。大家说：这一年，是我们部队学习毛主席著作更加深入、更加扎实、更加有成效的一年，也是各项工作取得更大成就的一年。
    党的八届十一中全会公报指出：“林彪同志号召人民解放军在全军展开学习毛泽东同志著作的群众运动，为全党全国树立了光辉的榜样。”全体指战员决心不辜负党和人民的期望，要适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，提高到一个新的阶段，要更加抓紧，要更加落实，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远突出无产阶级政治，永远保持旺盛的革命干劲，真正把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
