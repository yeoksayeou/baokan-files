The Albanian working class, under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour, has built the Tirana Cultural Palace with a spirit of self-reliance. The grand opening ceremony was held on the afternoon of September 16.

Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, personally cut the ribbon to open the ceremony.

At 5 p.m. that afternoon, a mass rally was held in Skanderbeg Square in front of the Cultural Palace. Shyqyri Dajana, Minister of Education and Culture, addressed the rally. He said that the Tirana Cultural Palace was built under the savage blockade of imperialism and revisionism. The Khrushchev revisionists rudely tore up the original agreement to build this cultural palace, but their sabotage met with complete failure. The Albanian working class, relying entirely on its own strength, built the Cultural Palace, and built it larger, better equipped, and more magnificent than originally planned. All the difficulties and complex technical problems encountered in the design, construction, and installation of the Cultural Palace were successfully solved by the Albanian workers and engineering and technical personnel with lofty patriotism and creative genius. Dajana said that the construction of the Cultural Palace once again shows that our party and government have always been concerned with our nation's socialist culture and art.

He said that the new five-year plan has put forward the great task of further deepening the cultural revolution. People on the cultural front should devote all their energy and creative abilities to successfully complete this task.

Dajana wished the Tirana Cultural Palace to better implement the party's policies, carry out communist education for the masses, and enable a broader mass of people to participate in literary and artistic creation and criticism activities. After the speech, the attendees entered the Cultural Palace for a tour.

The newly built Tirana Cultural Palace is fully modernized in both construction and equipment. Its construction volume has been expanded from the original 56,000 cubic meters designed by Soviet experts to 115,000 cubic meters. The Cultural Palace includes four parts: an opera and ballet theater that can accommodate 1,000 spectators, a national library with 800,000 books, an exhibition hall, and a mass cultural hall.

    新华社地拉那十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，以自力更生精神建成的地拉那文化宫十六日下午隆重开幕。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记恩维尔·霍查亲自为开幕式剪彩。
    这天下午五时整，在文化宫前面的斯坎德培广场举行了群众大会。教育和文化部长绍马·德雅纳在大会上讲了话。他说，地拉那文化宫是在帝国主义和修正主义者野蛮包围的条件下建成的。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者粗暴地破坏了原来签订的建筑这座文化宫的协议，但是，他们的破坏遭到了彻底的失败。阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级完全依靠自己的力量把文化宫建设起来了，并且建设得比过去设想的更大、设备更好、更庄重。在设计、建筑施工和安装设备中的一切难题和复杂的技术问题，都被阿尔巴尼亚工人和工程技术人员，以崇高的爱国主义精神和创造智慧天才地、成功地解决了。德雅纳说，文化宫的建筑再次说明，我国党和政府不断关怀着我们民族和社会主义的文化和艺术。
    他说，新的五年计划提出了思想和文化革命进一步深入的巨大任务。文化战线上的人们应该以全部精力和创造才能顺利地去完成这个任务。
    德雅纳预祝地拉那文化宫更好地执行党的政策，对群众进行共产主义教育，让更广泛的群众参加文艺创作和评论活动。讲话后，参加集会的群众进入文化宫参观。
    新建的地拉那文化宫的全部建筑和设备都是现代化的。它的建筑体积从原来苏联专家设计的五万六千立方米扩大到十一万五千立方米。文化宫包括四个部分：能容纳一千名观众的歌剧芭蕾舞剧院、有八十万藏书的国家图书馆、展览厅和群众文化馆。
