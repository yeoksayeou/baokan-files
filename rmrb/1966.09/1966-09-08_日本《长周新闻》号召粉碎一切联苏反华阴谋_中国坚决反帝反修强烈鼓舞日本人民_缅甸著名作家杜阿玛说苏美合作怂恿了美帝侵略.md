The Japanese newspaper "Long Week News" published in Shimoguni, Yamaguchi Prefecture, issued an editorial on August 21, calling on the Japanese people to strengthen their friendship and unity with the Chinese people and to smash all conspiracies that collaborate with the Soviet Union to oppose China.

The editorial states that the 700 million Chinese people, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, have liberated China and are now at the forefront of the struggle for the liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, advancing bravely.

The editorial continues, "At present, the Chinese people are resolutely carrying out socialist construction at home and have achieved great results; at the same time, they are firmly opposing American imperialism and thoroughly exposing the deception of modern revisionism, with the Soviet leadership as the main culprit, which has become a lackey of American imperialism. The Chinese people are selflessly supporting the struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world and are fighting at the forefront of the international anti-American united front. This fact has deeply moved and strongly inspired the Japanese people."

According to Xinhua News Agency, on August 30, the famous Burmese writer Du Ama published an article in "The People's Daily" stating: "We should strongly condemn the collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States and be vigilant against the betrayal of the anti-imperialist struggle and the national liberation cause by the Soviet leaders."

She said that the compromise between Soviet revisionists and American imperialists has intensified the flames of aggressive war. Due to their so-called "peaceful coexistence," the United States has withdrawn many of its troops from Europe and sent them to Vietnam. She said, "The so-called peaceful understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union is not bringing peace to the world but is encouraging imperialist aggressors. This is an undeniable fact that cannot be covered up."

    缅甸著名作家杜阿玛说苏美合作怂恿了美帝侵略
    据新华社讯　日本山口县下关市出版的《长周新闻》八月二十一日发表社论，号召日本人民加强同中国人民的友谊和团结，粉碎一切联苏反华的阴谋。
    社论说，七亿中国人民在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，解放了中国，现在正站在全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族解放斗争的前列奋勇前进。
    社论接着说，“现在，中国人民坚毅地进行国内社会主义建设，取得了伟大的成果；与此同时，也在针锋相对地反对美帝国主义，彻底地揭露已经堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶、以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义的欺骗。”中国人民“毫不吝惜地支持世界上一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的斗争，并且站在国际反美统一战线的前列而战斗。这一事实深深地感动了、强烈地鼓舞了日本人民。”
    据新华社讯　缅甸著名作家杜阿玛八月三十日在《人民报》上发表文章说：“我们应该强烈谴责苏美勾结，并且对苏联领导人背叛反帝斗争和民族解放事业保持警惕。”
    她说，苏联修正主义者和美帝国主义者之间的妥协加剧了侵略战争的火焰。由于他们之间的“和平共处”，已经使得美国把它的许多军队撤出欧洲，开往越南。她说：“美苏之间的所谓和平谅解，并不是给世界带来和平而是怂恿帝国主义侵略者。这是无论如何也掩盖不了的千真万确的事实。”
