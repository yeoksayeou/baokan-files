Shanghai's revolutionary masses, who are in the midst of the great proletarian cultural revolution, have recently received a powerful ideological weapon—the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong."

On the day the "Quotations" were distributed, tens of thousands of readers at the various branches and bookstalls of the Shanghai New China Bookstore received the red, shining copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" from the hands of the bookstore staff. Overwhelmed with joy, they could not help but shout, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand years!" The slogans and cheers echoed continuously, fully expressing the Shanghai revolutionary masses' boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and their boundless faith and admiration for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! They vowed to read Chairman Mao's books thoroughly and unconditionally implement the Sixteen Points, carrying the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

A high school student braved the rain to arrive at the bookstore at three in the morning to stand in line. When he was the first to receive the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" from the bookstore staff, he was so excited that he repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!"

As soon as the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" arrived at the Baoshan County New China Bookstore, the staff immediately delivered the books to the Chengzhong Production Brigade of the Wusong Commune. The brigade cadres, who were holding a meeting there, all rushed forward to buy them. The brigade's women's director happily said, "Chairman Mao's books are what we poor and lower-middle peasants love to read the most. Every time I go out to attend a meeting, the commune members always remind me to bring back a few copies of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong.' This time, this wish has finally been fulfilled!"

    据新华社上海电　正处在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中的上海广大革命群众，最近又有十五万人获得了威力无比的思想武器——《毛主席语录》。
    发行《语录》这一天，上海市各新华书店门市部和书亭前，读者们以无比激动的心情，从书店营业员手里，接过一本本红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，他们欣喜若狂，情不自禁地欢呼着。“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”口号声、欢呼声此起彼伏，连续不断，充分表达了上海革命群众对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限信仰、无限崇拜！他们表示，一定好好读毛主席的书，不折不扣地贯彻执行十六条，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    一个高中学生，清早三点钟冒雨赶到书店排队，他第一个从书店营业员手里接过《毛主席语录》时，激动得连连高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    《毛主席语录》一到宝山县新华书店，工作人员立即把书送到吴淞公社城中大队。正在那里开会的大队干部们个个争先拥上来购买。大队妇女主任高兴地说：“毛主席的书，我们贫下中农最爱读。我每次出去开会，社员们总是叮嘱要我给带几本《毛主席语录》，这次，这个愿望总算实现了！”
