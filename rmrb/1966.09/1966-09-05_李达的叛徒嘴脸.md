After liberation, Li Da re-entered the Party, donning a "red" cloak, swindling and boasting everywhere that he was one of the "founders of the Chinese Communist Party" and the "earliest Marxist in China." These shameless lies are a grave insult to our great leader Chairman Mao, who personally founded and nurtured the Chinese Communist Party. The facts prove that Li Da is an opportunist who infiltrated the Party and a sycophant of Chen Duxiu's right-opportunism.

Li Da returned from studying in Japan in 1920, neither participating in the then-booming patriotic student movement nor in the workers' revolutionary struggles. This right-wing figure of the May Fourth Movement joined the Party with ulterior motives.

Li Da was never a revolutionary but a thoroughgoing opportunist. After infiltrating the Party, he attempted to sabotage it from within, turning it into a scholarly group for studying Marxism. He was both terrified and hostile toward the burgeoning workers' movement led by the Party. He criticized the Party for focusing on implementing Marxism rather than "studying" it. After 1924, when the workers' and peasants' revolutionary movements were surging, Li Da stood outside these movements, hiding in university libraries to "study" Marxism.

After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Da vehemently opposed the proletariat leading the Chinese revolution. He advised the bourgeoisie on how to seize the leadership of the revolution and establish a bourgeois dictatorship.

In 1923, Li Da proclaimed: "History tells us that the democratic revolution is led by the commercial and industrial classes, and China's current situation is like this. The commercial and industrial classes must undertake the democratic revolution, forming a government of the people to fulfill their class mission." By "commercial and industrial classes," Li Da referred to the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. This means that after the October Revolution, China should follow the old path of bourgeois democratic revolution, led by the big bourgeoisie. This fallacy is identical to that of Chen Duxiu's right-opportunism and stands in opposition to Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao said: "China urgently needs a bourgeois democratic revolution, which must be led by the proletariat to be completed." Yet, Li Da wanted the proletariat to hand over the leadership. Li Da's words and actions at the time were all against the leadership of the proletariat, a betrayal of the revolution.

In 1927, when the Chinese people's revolution was achieving great victories, Chiang Kai-shek suddenly betrayed the revolution, carrying out a bloody massacre of the Communist Party and revolutionary people, burying the thriving revolution.

We must ask, why, when Chiang Kai-shek's clique launched the counter-revolutionary "May 30 Incident" in Changsha in 1927, with Communist Party members and revolutionary workers and peasants lying dead everywhere, was Li Da unharmed? Why, after Wang Jingwei launched the counter-revolutionary "July 15 Incident" in Wuhan in 1927, with Sun Yat-sen University (predecessor of Wuhan University) being bloodily massacred, could Li Da still teach at Sun Yat-sen University in Wuhan? Why, after 1928, in Shanghai, where Chiang Kai-shek's White Terror and counter-revolutionary "cultural encirclement" were at their most brutal, could Li Da openly write books and articles? Why, after the "September 18 Incident" in 1931, when North China was in crisis and Chiang Kai-shek's clique and Japanese imperialism colluded to brutally suppress the revolutionary people, especially persecuting young students' anti-Japanese patriotic activities, could Li Da be the head of the economics department at Beiping University, earning hundreds of silver dollars a month to lecture on "Marxism-Leninism"? It turns out that Li Da was terrified by Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary bloody massacres and became a despicable traitor. In late August 1927, he published statements in the *Wuhan Minbao* and *Hankou Min Guo Ribao*, openly betraying the Party and defecting to the enemy.

From July to September 1928, in Shanghai, the epicenter of the Nationalist Party's White Terror and counter-revolutionary "cultural encirclement," Li Da wrote reactionary articles such as "The Revolution China Needs" and "Democracy in the Revolutionary Process" as another public declaration of his betrayal of the Party. In these reactionary articles, Li Da fully exposed his traitorous face.

First, he attempted to exonerate Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution and the massacre.

Li Da described Chiang Kai-shek's 1927 massacre of the Communist Party and revolutionary people as merely a "conflict," blaming the Communists for "extremism," "emotional involvement," treating the cooperation between the Nationalists and Communists as a mere "temporary strategy," and "sleeping in the same bed but dreaming differently," thus "laying the seeds for the later split." Li Da was so deranged and twisted that he shifted the blame for Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution onto the Communist Party.

Second, he clamored for the "dissolution" of the Communist Party.

Li Da shouted: "It is impossible to achieve a bourgeois revolution with only two-tenths of one percent of the population being industrial workers." He maliciously claimed that peasants were "accustomed to feudal exploitation and oppression" and that peasants "never cared about political power." According to Li Da's logic, since the proletariat was small in number and peasants could not become allies in the revolution, the "proletariat and peasants" could not complete the revolution alone. Therefore, "the objective conditions for a proletarian revolution are lacking, so it is better to dissolve this organization." This fully exposed him as the most loyal slave of the Nationalist Party's reactionaries.

Third, he viciously attacked Chairman Mao's leadership of armed struggle and the land revolution.

In October 1927, Chairman Mao led the workers' and peasants' Red Army to Jianxi, where they engaged in armed struggle, implemented land revolution, established a red revolutionary base, and established a government of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This was a historic achievement. Li Da, however, maliciously cursed: "Given the current objective conditions and subjective forces of the revolution, the Communist Party's style of rural uprising social revolutionary movement is not only useless but also harmful to the revolution. It only increases the hatred of the masses towards them, ultimately leading to their own demise." Li Da's vicious attacks were propaganda for the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek's "extermination of the Communists." History is merciless, and violent revolution cannot be cursed down. Our great leader Chairman Mao led our Party and people to overthrow old China with guns, establish new China, and point the way for the world's revolutionary people.

Fourth, he advised Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries on how to suppress the revolutionary movement.

Li Da strongly defended Chiang Kai-shek's suppression of the workers' and peasants' revolutionary movement, claiming: "Capitalists are exploited and oppressed by the laboring masses, and when they can no longer bear the laboring masses' coercion, they naturally seek the protection of feudal forces." He also claimed: "The source of China's chaos can be eliminated," otherwise, if the proletariat rose up in revolution, it would "bring endless disasters, and the survival of the Chinese nation would be in an unendurable situation." He advised the "Nationalist Party to do positive work, not just negative work." Look! Li Da was indeed a loyal advisor to Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolution.

Because Li Da betrayed the revolution, he rose rapidly. In 1937, CC spy chief Chen Lifu summoned him in Nanjing. Later, Li Da boasted that he had "talked at length" with Chen Lifu about how to cultivate "Chinese economic construction talents." Chen Lifu highly praised Li Da for his efforts in cultivating fascist dictatorship tools for the four major families, saying, "Good, good." Then, the enemy of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek, summoned Li Da to Lushan. Chiang Kai-shek highly valued this loyal slave of anti-communism and anti-people, treating him as an honored guest and wanting to appoint this anti-communist and anti-people general to be a "consultant" of the fake Executive Yuan.

Look, Li Da has such a despicable history! After liberation, he shamelessly claimed to be an "old revolutionary." Now that his true colors have been exposed, he is a vicious anti-communist who has the blood of revolutionary martyrs on his hands, a shameless traitor.

Editor's Note: In the midst of the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan University exposed the anti-Party, anti-socialist rightist Li Da. Li Da was not only the president of Wuhan University but also a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the former president of the Chinese Philosophical Society, a genuine bourgeois reactionary academic "authority."

Those bourgeois representatives who infiltrate the Party all disguise themselves as revolutionaries, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. In this regard, Li Da was particularly prominent. He boasted that he was the "earliest Marxist in China," an "old-school Marxist philosopher." What arrogance and shamelessness!

Originally, Li Da was a landlord who exploited the blood and sweat of peasants. He infiltrated the Party for opportunistic reasons. As early as 1927, when Chiang Kai-shek implemented the White Terror, he was terrified and surrendered to the enemy, becoming a traitor. He has always been pro-Chiang, pro-Japanese, and anti-communist.

Li Da has always opposed the combination of Marxism with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposed revolutionary mass movements, and advocated studying Marxism in university libraries. Li Da particularly hated the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works. He maliciously slandered the workers, peasants, and soldiers studying philosophy as a "joke," an "irony." Because after the workers, peasants, and soldiers mastered Mao Zedong Thought in revolutionary practice, these bourgeois "authorities" could only collapse.

Li Da viciously attacked the Party's proletarian educational policy, opposed the educational revolution, and opposed the Party's leadership. In Wuhan University, he implemented bourgeois dictatorship and the "professors' governance" line, excluding and attacking worker-peasant cadres and revolutionary students. He wanted to turn our socialist university into a stronghold for bourgeois conspiracy and restoration.

The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" points out: "We must organize a criticism of those representative bourgeois elements who have infiltrated the Party and bourgeois reactionary academic 'authorities.'" Li Da is a double-dealing figure. He claims to be an "old revolutionary" and an "old Party member," using "Marxist philosophy authority" as a signboard to engage in anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities. We must, according to the regulations of the Sixteen Points, fight against, overthrow, and crush Li Da and his ilk, the bourgeois representatives and bourgeois "authorities," making them never able to rise again.

    李达的叛徒嘴脸
    激扬
    解放以后，李达重新钻进党内，披着“红色”的外衣，到处招摇撞骗，胡吹自己是“中国共产党的创始人”、“中国最早的马克思主义者”。这些无耻谰言，是对我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和培育的中国共产党的莫大侮辱。事实证明，李达是一个混进党内的投机分子，是陈独秀右倾机会主义的应声虫。
    李达于一九二○年从日本留学回来，既没有参加当时轰轰烈烈的学生爱国运动，更没有参加工人的革命斗争。他这个“五四”运动的右翼，怀着不可告人的目的，混进了党的队伍。
    李达从来就不是一个革命者，而是地地道道的机会主义者。他混进党后，就妄图从内部来瓦解党，把党变成一个闭门“研究”马克思主义的学术团体。他对当时在党领导下蓬蓬勃勃发展的工人运动，既恐惧又仇视。他攻击党只注重实行马克思主义，不注重“研究”马克思主义。一九二四年以后，在工农革命运动日益高涨的时候，李达却站在工农群众运动的外面，钻到大学书斋里“研究”马克思主义去了。
    中国共产党成立以后，李达极力反对无产阶级领导中国革命，他向资产阶级出谋献策，要资产阶级来掌握革命的领导权，建立资产阶级专政的国家。
    李达在一九二三年宣扬说：“历史告诉我们说，民主革命是商工阶级做主动的，中国现况就是这样。”“商工阶级必定要这样的从事民主革命”，“组成于自身利益的民治政府，才能完成自己阶级的使命。”李达在这里所说的商工阶级，是“有新智识的官绅和富商大贾”，也就是官僚买办资产阶级和民族资产阶级。这就是说，在十月革命以后，中国要走资产阶级旧民主革命的老路，要由大资产阶级来领导中国资产阶级民主革命。这种谬论，完全与陈独秀右倾机会主义者是一样的，而与毛泽东思想相对立。毛主席说：“中国迫切需要一个资产阶级的民主革命，这个革命必须由无产阶级领导才能完成。”而李达却要无产阶级拱手交出领导权。李达当时从言论到行动，都是反对无产阶级的领导权，是背叛革命的。
    一九二七年，正当中国人民大革命取得伟大胜利的时候，蒋介石突然叛变革命，对中国共产党和革命人民实行了血腥的大屠杀，生气蓬勃的大革命被葬送了。
    我们要问，为什么当蒋介石匪帮一九二七年五月在长沙发动反革命的“马日事变”，共产党员和革命工农群众尸横遍地、血流成河时，李达却在那里安然无事？为什么当汪精卫一九二七年七月在武汉发动反革命的“七一五”事变，武昌中山大学（注：武汉大学前身）惨遭血洗之后，李达却仍然能在武昌中山大学当教授？为什么一九二八年以后，在蒋介石实行白色恐怖和反革命文化“围剿”最凶残的上海，李达却能在那里公开著书立说写文章？为什么一九三一年“九一八”事变后，正当华北危亡，蒋介石匪帮和日本帝国主义勾结起来疯狂镇压革命人民，特别是迫害青年学生抗日爱国活动的时候，李达却能在当时的北平大学当经济系主任，以每月几百元大洋的优厚待遇，大讲其“马列主义”？原来李达被蒋介石的反革命血腥屠杀吓破了胆，当了可耻的叛徒。一九二七年八月下旬他在《武汉民报》和《汉口民国日报》上发表了声明，公开叛党投敌。
    一九二八年七月至九月，李达在国民党反动派白色恐怖和反革命文化“围剿”的重心上海，又写了《中国所需要的革命》和《革命过程中之民主革命》等反动文章，作为再一次公开叛党的声明书，公诸于世。在这些反动文章里，充分暴露了李达的叛徒嘴脸。
    第一，为蒋介石叛变革命和大屠杀的罪行开脱。
    李达把一九二七年蒋介石对共产党和革命人民的大屠杀，说成只是一场“纷纠”，并污蔑这场“纷纠”是共产党人造成的。是因为共产党人“走于极端”，“夹杂着感情”，把国共合作“只当作一时的策略”，是“同床异梦，各自为谋”，为“后来的决裂”“埋伏了种子”。李达就是这样丧心病狂，颠倒黑白，把蒋介石叛变革命的罪责，强加在共产党的头上。
    第二，叫嚣要“解散”共产党。
    李达叫嚷：“以全人口千分之二的产业工人来实现资产阶级革命，当然是不可能的事情”。胡说农民对于封建的剥削压迫，是“习惯成自然”，农民对于政权，“素来是不过问的”。照李达的逻辑，无产阶级人数少，农民又不能成为革命的同盟军，“无产工农”“不能单独完成革命”，因此“无产阶级革命客观条件欠缺，不如索性解散这个组织”。这完全暴露了他自己是国民党反动派的最忠实的奴才。
    第三，疯狂地攻击毛主席领导的武装斗争和土地革命。
    一九二七年十月，毛主席率领工农红军向井冈山进军，在那里进行武装斗争，实行土地革命，建立了红色革命根据地，建立了工农兵政权。这是具有伟大历史意义的创举。李达却恶毒咒骂说：“就目前革命的客观条件和主观力量说，像共产党那样农村暴动式的社会革命运动，不但于革命无益，而且有害，而且只有增加民众对于他们的痛恨，结果不免要自速其萎缩。”李达的这些恶毒攻击，就是为人民公敌蒋介石进行“剿共”作舆论动员。历史是无情的，暴力革命是骂不倒的，伟大领袖毛主席领导我们党和人民，用枪杆子推翻了旧中国，建立了新中国，而且为世界革命人民指明了革命的道路。
    第四，为蒋介石反动派镇压革命运动出谋献策。
    李达极力为蒋介石镇压工农革命运动作辩护，他胡说：资本家“受劳动民众所利用所压迫，……到了受不住劳动民众的胁迫时，就自然而然的要假借封建势力为护符了。”他还胡说：“中国的乱源可以肃清”，否则，如果让无产阶级起来革命了，就会“引起无穷的祸害，中国民族的生存威胁，就不知要达到怎样不堪的境遇。”他劝“国民党应该做积极方面的工作，不必专做消极方面的工作”。看！李达真不愧为蒋介石反革命的忠实谋士。
    由于李达叛卖有功，他就飞黄腾达，青云直上。一九三七年CC特务头子陈立夫在南京召见了他。后来李达炫耀自己说，他曾向陈立夫“滔滔不绝”地畅谈其如何培养“中国经济建设人才”的问题。陈立夫则对李达如此卖力为四大家族培养法西斯专政的工具，十分赞许，连称：“很好，很好。”接着，中国人民公敌蒋介石又在庐山召见李达，蒋介石对这个反共有功的忠实奴才极为器重，“以上宾之礼相待”，并要请这个反共反人民的干将去做伪行政院“参事”。
    看，李达有这样丑恶的历史！解放后，他竟无耻地妄称自己为“老革命”。现在把他的画皮戳穿了，他是个双手沾满革命烈士鲜血的凶恶的反共老手，是一个无耻的叛徒。
    编者按：在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，武汉大学广大革命师生揪出了反党反社会主义的右派分子李达。李达不仅是武汉大学校长，还是中国科学院学部委员，前中国哲学会会长，是一个地地道道的资产阶级反动学术“权威”。
    混进党内的资产阶级代表人物都要在自己的身上披上革命的伪装，打着“红旗”反红旗。在这方面，李达表现得非常突出。他胡说自己是“中国最早的马克思主义者”，“老牌的马克思主义哲学家”。真是自吹自擂，恬不知耻！
    原来，李达是个一贯榨取农民血汗的地主分子。为了投机曾混入党内。早在一九二七年蒋介石实行白色恐怖的时候，他就吓破了胆，自首投敌，当了叛徒。他一直亲蒋，媚日，反共。
    李达一贯反对马克思主义与工农兵群众相结合，反对革命的群众运动，主张钻在大学书斋里“研究”马克思主义。李达特别仇视工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作，他污蔑工农兵学哲学是“笑话”，是“讽刺”。因为工农兵群众在革命实践中掌握了毛泽东思想以后，他们这些资产阶级“权威”就只能垮台。
    李达恶毒地攻击党的无产阶级教育方针，反对教学革命运动，反对党的领导。他在武汉大学实行资产阶级专政，实行资产阶级“教授治校”的路线，排斥、打击工农干部和革命学生。他要把我们社会主义的大学变成资产阶级阴谋复辟的阵地。
    《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》指出：“要组织对那些有代表性的混进党内的资产阶级代表人物和资产阶级的反动学术‘权威’，进行批判”。李达是个双料货的人物。他以“老革命”“老党员”自居，以“马克思主义哲学权威”作招牌，进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动。我们一定按十六条的规定，把李达之类的资产阶级代表人物、资产阶级“权威”斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，使他们永世不得翻身。
