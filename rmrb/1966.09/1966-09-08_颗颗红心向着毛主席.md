    Editor's Note: Our great teacher, great leader, great commander-in-chief, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, on August 18th, received a million-strong army of the Cultural Revolution in the capital. This great event has greatly inspired the people of the entire nation and has promoted the ongoing, vigorous proletarian Cultural Revolution. Currently, this great movement, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is developing in depth, not only affecting culture but also politics and economics. The revolutionary tide of the masses is sweeping away all the filth left over from the old society, changing the entire social landscape of our country. On all fronts across the nation, a great situation has emerged.

    Millions of hearts fly towards Chairman Mao. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary youth of the entire nation yearn so much to see our Chairman Mao! They hope so much to share the happiness of being with Chairman Mao! The film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Army of the Cultural Revolution" truly recreates the great scene of Chairman Mao receiving the million-strong army of the Cultural Revolution. Through the film, billions of people will feel boundless happiness and receive tremendous inspiration. Many revolutionary masses, after watching this film, have sent letters and articles to our newspaper, expressing their boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, and their determination to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We are now selecting a few to publish here. Let us deeply imprint this unforgettable scene in our hearts, muster our revolutionary spirit, and advance bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    Every Heart Beats for Chairman Mao
    Beijing Tiananmen Guard, Five-Good Soldier, Lu Yancai

    I watched the large-scale color documentary "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Army of the Cultural Revolution" with boundless excitement. As the film played, my heart resonated with that of the million-strong army. Especially when I saw Chairman Mao in his olive-green military uniform with the revolutionary army, and saw Chairman Mao standing on the Tiananmen City Gate waving to the million-strong army, my heart felt like it was going to jump out! I forgot that I was in the cinema, and my heart couldn't help but shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!

    The film most vividly shows the boundless love of the people of the entire nation for Chairman Mao, and the boundless loyalty of the youth, nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought, to Chairman Mao. Their hearts all beat for Chairman Mao.

    In the film, there are many very moving scenes. Especially when the Red Guards shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" and the cheers echoed endlessly in the sky, and when the meeting was about to disperse, they still seized the time to take another look at Chairman Mao, these scenes made me think of some Red Guards we saw in front of Tiananmen who loved Chairman Mao.

    I am a guard at Tiananmen. I personally saw a Red Guard who came from outside the province after Chairman Mao received the million-strong army of the Cultural Revolution on August 18th. Because he arrived late, he missed this happy meeting and did not see Chairman Mao, so he came to Tiananmen and stood in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, staring at it for more than an hour, unwilling to leave. There were also some students from outside the province who arrived late and did not see Chairman Mao, and they cried in disappointment. Every day, we see many Red Guards in front of Tiananmen. They gather in groups of ten or eight in front of Chairman Mao's portrait and take oaths, saying: "Chairman Mao, we will definitely listen to your words, care about state affairs, and carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end! We will definitely defend Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao, wish you longevity!" They shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" Sometimes, when it rains, the Red Guard youths cover the portraits of Chairman Mao they brought with their clothes and put their raincoats on the portraits of Chairman Mao, saying that it doesn't matter if their bodies get wet, as long as they protect the portrait of Chairman Mao, their hearts will be warm.

    The revolutionary youth nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought love Chairman Mao so much, listen to Chairman Mao's words so much, and are so loyal to the Party! As a soldier of the People's Liberation Army and a guard at the Tiananmen of our great motherland, I vow to listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the youth, and forever defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. I will be with the Red Guards of the entire nation and with the millions of revolutionary masses of the entire nation, defending the ironclad mountains of the proletariat, ensuring that the socialist motherland will never change color, forever red, forever red!

    千百万颗红心飞向毛主席。全国的革命群众，全国的革命青少年多么渴望见到我们的毛主席啊！多么希望分享和毛主席在一起的幸福啊！影片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》真实地再现了毛主席接见百万文化革命大军的伟大场面。从影片中，亿万人民将感受到无限的幸福，得到巨大的鼓舞。许多革命群众看了这部影片后，纷纷给本报来信来稿，热情洋溢地表达了他们对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，表达了他们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。现在选择几篇发表在这里。让我们把永远令人难忘的场面深印在心头，鼓足革命干劲，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进！
    颗颗红心向着毛主席
    北京天安门哨兵、五好战士　卢燕财
    我怀着无限激动的心情看完了大型彩色纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》。随着电影的放映，我的心和百万大军一样，发出了共鸣。特别当我看到毛主席身穿草绿色军装和革命大军在一起，看到毛主席站在天安门城楼上向百万大军招手致意的时候，我的心就像要跳出来一样！我忘记了是在电影院里，心里禁不住地要高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    影片最集中地体现了全国人民对毛主席的无限热爱，表现了在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的青年，对毛主席无限忠诚，他们的颗颗红心都向着毛主席。
    在影片中，有不少最激动人心的场面。特别是红卫兵小将们欢呼“毛主席，万岁！毛主席，万岁！”的声浪经久不息地响彻云霄，会要散了，他们还抓紧时间，再多看毛主席一眼的镜头，使我联想到我们在天安门前见到的一些红卫兵热爱毛主席的情景。
    我是天安门前守卫部队的一个哨兵。我亲眼看见在八月十八日毛主席接见百万文化革命大军大会以后才从外地赶来的一个红卫兵，因为自己来晚了，没有赶上这次幸福的会见，没有见到毛主席，他就来到天安门站在毛主席的画像前，目不转睛地看了一个多小时，还舍不得离开。还有从外地来的一些同学，也因为来晚了，没有见到毛主席，难过得哭起来。每天，我们在天安门前，都看见很多红卫兵，他们十个八个的在毛主席像前宣誓，他们说：“毛主席，我们一定听您的话，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我们一定要捍卫毛泽东思想。毛主席，祝您老人家万寿无疆。”他们高呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”有时，天下雨了，红卫兵小将们就用自己的衣服把带来的毛主席像包上，把自己的雨衣给毛主席像披上，他们说，雨淋凉了自己的身子没关系，只要保护了毛主席的像，就暖了自己的心。
    在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的革命青少年，是多么热爱毛主席，多么听毛主席的话，多么忠于党啊！作为一名解放军战士，作为伟大祖国首都天安门前的一个哨兵，我誓死要听毛主席的话，坚决支持青少年的革命行动，永远保卫党中央、保卫毛主席。我要和全国的红卫兵在一起，和全国千百万革命群众在一起，保卫无产阶级铁打的江山，让社会主义祖国永不变色，永远鲜红，鲜红！
