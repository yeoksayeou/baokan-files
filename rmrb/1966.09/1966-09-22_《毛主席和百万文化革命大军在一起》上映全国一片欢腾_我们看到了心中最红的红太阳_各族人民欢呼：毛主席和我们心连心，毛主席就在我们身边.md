The film "Chairman Mao and the Million Strong Cultural Revolution Army" is now premiering in major cities and some medium-sized cities across the country. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres who have watched this brilliant film are greatly inspired. They say: This is a major event in the political life of the nation. The film fulfills our longing to see our great leader Chairman Mao. The revolutionary masses who have watched the film pledge to the Party and Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of all our nationalities. We will forever follow Chairman Mao and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! We will forever defend the iron-clad proletarian state!

The premiere of this film in various places has created a festive atmosphere. Eight movie theaters in Urumqi City were decorated with red banners, propaganda posters, and flags to warmly welcome the revolutionary masses of all nationalities. All movie theaters, theaters, and clubs in colleges, factories, and enterprises in Nanning City hung large red banners and slogans, and decorated the place with lanterns, creating a joyous atmosphere. Inside the theaters, when the audience saw Chairman Mao in military uniform appear on the screen, they spontaneously raised their fists and shouted together with the revolutionary comrades on the screen: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

This film has brought the greatest care and encouragement from Chairman Mao to the broad masses of workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres. The broad masses of workers and peasants excitedly said that Chairman Mao always cares for the revolutionary masses, has unlimited trust in the revolutionary masses, and is heart-to-heart with the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao is like standing by our side. We workers and peasants must listen to Chairman Mao's words, seize the revolution, promote production, and shoulder the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production. Workers from the Shenyang New China Printing Factory wrote to the newspaper immediately after watching the film. They expressed their determination to muster even greater revolutionary enthusiasm and print more and better copies of Chairman Mao's works, so that the broad revolutionary masses can read the brilliant works of our great leader Chairman Mao as soon as possible. Li Xinyou from Yanzhuang Production Brigade, Sacrifice Commune, Zhengzhou Suburb said, "In 1958, Chairman Mao came to our place. I have been thinking about it every day and looking forward to seeing him again. Today, although Chairman Mao is thousands of miles away from me, watching the film makes me feel as if I am by Chairman Mao's side."

Many Red Guards said after watching the film that seeing our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao in military uniform and wearing a red armband of the Red Guards makes us feel extremely honored and proud. They expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use the "Sixteen Points" as a weapon, and resolutely complete the great tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform.

Chairman Mao in military uniform with the million-strong Cultural Revolution Army has given the broad masses of the People's Liberation Army even greater encouragement. Soldier Liu Binghong from a certain unit of the PLA in Nanning City wrote a poem immediately after watching the film: "Chairman Mao in military uniform, the soldier's strength is doubled, tightly gripping the gun in hand, standing in battle formation to fight the wolves. Chairman Mao in military uniform, the revolutionary people's courage is boosted, fearing neither storms nor waves, daring to charge through knife mountains and fire seas."
