The proletarian class of the Mao Zedong era loves to sing revolutionary songs. We workers of the Shanghai Yangshupu Power Plant have, since the Great Leap Forward of 1958, launched a magnificent mass movement of singing revolutionary songs. In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, as the main force of the Cultural Revolution, sing in praise of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. With our mighty battle songs, we launch a fierce attack on all the monsters and demons!

We have been educated and inspired by participating in the revolutionary song movement. We deeply feel that: Revolutionary songs are great!

Revolutionary songs are great! This is because revolutionary songs sing in praise of the Party, Chairman Mao, and the great Mao Zedong Thought. We love the Party, Chairman Mao, and the great Mao Zedong Thought from the bottom of our hearts. When we sing the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," we feel instantly enlightened, as if Chairman Mao were standing before us, guiding our way forward.

Revolutionary songs are great! This is because revolutionary songs sing the strongest notes of our socialist era. They sing in praise of the great construction of our socialist motherland, and the brilliant victories of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. To change the face of our impoverished motherland, for the world revolution, we are unafraid of difficulties and hardships, daring to struggle and daring to win. "No matter how high the mountains, we will climb them; no matter how deep the seas, we will fill them. With a red heart towards the Party, workers face no difficulties!" These powerful lyrics are our bold words, inspiring us to strive for progress and revolution continuously. As our workers say, "The more revolutionary songs we sing, the redder our hearts become; singing songs gives us strength!"

Revolutionary songs are great! This is because revolutionary songs sing in praise of the heroes of the Mao Zedong era, expressing our firm belief in "studying Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions." In 1963, after Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," the song "Learn from the Good Example of Lei Feng, Loyal to the Revolution, Loyal to the Party..." echoed through every corner of our factory. The ordinary yet glorious life of the great communist warrior Lei Feng inspires and encourages us to move forward. Every time we sing a heroic song, we receive an education in Mao Zedong Thought; we sing about the advanced, learn from the advanced, sing about the heroes, and learn from the heroes, marching forward on the path of revolutionization.

Revolutionary songs are great! This is because revolutionary songs are a powerful weapon in our struggle against monsters and demons. We sing revolutionary songs loudly, take the stage, occupy the battlefield, and launch a fierce attack on the monsters and demons! In September 1962, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Never forget class struggle," and we immediately created revolutionary songs such as "Class Struggle Must Never Be Forgotten," using our battle songs to educate ourselves and strike down the enemy. We will use our mighty revolutionary songs to overwhelm the decadent music of the bourgeoisie! We will sing until imperialism trembles with fear, until revisionism shakes with terror, until all monsters and demons are struck with dread!

Revolutionary songs are great! We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, tightly grasp the gun of revolutionary songs, thoroughly smash the "four olds" of the bourgeoisie, and thoroughly establish the "four news" of the proletariat. Let the songs of praise for Mao Zedong Thought resonate around the globe, and let revolutionary songs be sung from generation to generation!

    革命歌曲就是好！
    上海杨树浦发电厂老工人　姜林根等
    毛泽东时代的工人阶级，就是爱唱革命的歌曲。
    我们上海杨树浦发电厂职工，从一九五八年大跃进以来，开展了轰轰烈烈的群众性大唱革命歌曲活动。在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，我们以文化大革命主力军的战斗姿态，颂扬光辉的毛泽东思想；我们用气势磅礴的战歌，向一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火！
    我们从参加革命歌曲活动中受到教育，得到鼓舞，深深体会到：革命歌曲就是好！
    革命歌曲就是好！这是因为革命歌曲歌颂党，歌颂毛主席，歌颂伟大的毛泽东思想。我们从心底里热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱伟大的毛泽东思想。当我们唱起《大海航行靠舵手》这首歌的时候，心里顿时觉得亮堂堂的，毛主席好像就站在我们面前，指引着前进的方向。
    革命歌曲就是好！这是因为革命歌曲唱出了我们社会主义时代的最强音。它歌颂伟大祖国的社会主义建设，歌颂总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的光辉胜利。为了改变祖国一穷二白的面貌，为了世界革命，我们不怕难，不怕苦，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。“山再高，我们要攀，海再深，我们要填，一颗红心向着党，工人面前没困难！”这些响当当的歌词，就是我们的豪言壮语，它鼓舞着我们奋发图强，不断革命。正如我厂工人说的：“革命歌越唱心越红，唱歌唱出浑身劲！”
    革命歌曲就是好！这是因为革命歌曲歌颂毛泽东时代的英雄，唱出了我们“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”的坚定信念。一九六三年，毛主席发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召后，“学习雷锋好榜样，忠于革命忠于党……”的歌声，传遍了我们厂每一个角落。伟大的共产主义战士平凡而光辉的一生激励着我们，鼓舞着我们前进。我们每唱一支英雄赞歌，就是接受一次毛泽东思想的教育；我们唱先进、学先进，唱英雄、学英雄，在革命化的大道上阔步向前。
    革命歌曲就是好！这是因为革命歌曲是我们跟牛鬼蛇神作斗争的有力武器，我们高唱革命歌曲，登舞台、占阵地，向牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火！一九六二年九月，毛主席发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，我们立即创作了《阶级斗争永远不能忘》等革命歌曲，用战斗的歌声来教育自己，打击敌人。我们要用气壮山河的革命歌声，压倒资产阶级的靡靡之音！我们要唱得帝国主义胆颤心惊，唱得修正主义浑身发抖，唱得一切牛鬼蛇神丧魂落魄！
    革命歌曲就是好！我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧握住革命歌曲这杆枪，大破资产阶级的“四旧”，大立无产阶级的“四新”，把毛泽东思想的颂歌传遍全球，让革命歌曲一代一代唱下去！
