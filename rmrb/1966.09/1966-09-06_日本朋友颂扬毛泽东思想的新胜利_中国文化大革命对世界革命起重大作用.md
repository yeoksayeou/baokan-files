The third batch of Japanese Social Party activists' delegation to visit China concluded their friendly visit to our country and left Guangzhou to return home. Before their departure, they enthusiastically praised the great Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian cultural revolution currently underway in our country.

They said: "We have seen with our own eyes that under the guidance of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, China's socialist revolution and socialist construction are developing rapidly."

The delegation enthusiastically praised the proletarian cultural revolution that is currently underway in our country, describing it as a very great and remarkable revolution. They said: "The scope and depth of the proletarian cultural revolution are beyond our imagination in Japan. We believe that the cultural revolution being carried out in China is very necessary because it is the inevitable path to the completion of the socialist revolution and the transition to communism." They said: "Through the speeches of Chinese leaders and what we have heard and seen in China, we have come to understand the cultural revolution more and more, and thus we have come to understand why the Soviet Union took the path of revisionism. The proletarian cultural revolution being carried out in China is unprecedented in the history of socialist countries. This is a great initiative by Chairman Mao, a new victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

When discussing the proletarian cultural revolution, the delegation repeatedly expressed their highest respect and admiration for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. They said: "We have seen with our own eyes that Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China are the most trusting of the masses, the most reliant on the masses, the most enthusiastic in mobilizing the masses, and the most caring for the masses. The Red Guards, who are playing a vanguard role in the cultural revolution, are the best example. Under the brilliant and outstanding leadership of Chairman Mao, 700 million Chinese people are advancing on the path of the cultural revolution. We firmly believe that the proletarian cultural revolution underway in China will surely achieve victory, and it will play a significant role in the world revolution."

    日本朋友颂扬毛泽东思想的新胜利
    中国文化大革命对世界革命起重大作用
    据新华社讯　第三批日本社会党活动家访华代表团，结束在我国的友好访问离开广州回国前，热烈赞扬伟大的毛泽东思想和我国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命。
    他们说：“我们亲眼看到，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业正在迅速地发展。”
    代表团热烈赞扬我国正在轰轰烈烈进行的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场非常伟大、非常了不起的革命。他们说：“无产阶级文化大革命范围之广泛、意义之深刻是我们在日本所无法想象的。我们认为，中国进行的这场文化大革命是十分必要的，因为这是彻底完成社会主义革命并过渡到共产主义的必由之路。”他们说：“通过中国领导人的讲话以及我们在中国耳闻目睹的一切，使我们对文化大革命越来越了解，也就使我们认识到，苏联为什么会走上修正主义的道路。中国所进行的这一无产阶级文化大革命是社会主义国家中从未进行过的，是史无前例的。”日本朋友欢呼：这是毛主席的伟大创举，是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    在谈到无产阶级文化大革命时，代表团还一再表示他们对毛主席和中国共产党的最大敬意和钦佩。他们说：“我们亲眼看到，毛主席和中国共产党是最相信群众、最依靠群众、最放手发动群众，而又最支持群众和最无微不至关怀群众的。在文化大革命中起先锋作用的红卫兵就是最好的例子。七亿中国人民在毛主席天才的卓越的领导下，正在文化大革命的大路上向前迈进。我们坚信，中国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命一定会取得胜利，它将对世界革命起着重大的作用。”
