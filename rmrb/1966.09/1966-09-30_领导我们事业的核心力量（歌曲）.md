Editor's Note: In the midst of the deepening development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, creating a new high tide. On construction sites, in the fields, in classrooms, in military camps, in sentry posts, and in all places of mass activities, everywhere we see the moving scene of enthusiastic study of Chairman Mao's works. Everywhere we hear the voices of reciting Chairman Mao's quotations. The mass movement of our people studying Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply is an unprecedented feat in the history of proletarian revolution. It is the fundamental guarantee for our victory in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding light. To make revolution and build the country, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao says, to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, we must repeatedly study Chairman Mao's many fundamental viewpoints. Some aphorisms should even be memorized and repeatedly studied and applied. In the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works, the broad masses, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, have formed a tide of reading and using Chairman Mao's quotations. They eagerly hope that Chairman Mao's quotations will be known to every household and recited everywhere. Revolutionary music workers, to meet the masses' demands, have composed many tunes for Chairman Mao's quotations. This is a brand-new form. Just before National Day, to celebrate this great festival, we have selected ten segments of quotations set to music by Comrade Jiefu and the Central Orchestra for everyone to sing.

To use various art forms to propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental task of revolutionary art. We believe that, with the efforts of revolutionary music workers, the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations will certainly resound throughout the country. This will make Mao Zedong Thought penetrate deeper into people's hearts and shine forever.

    编者按：在无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的大好形势下，广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，出现了新的高潮。在工地，在田间，在课堂，在军营，在哨所，在一切群众活动场所，到处都出现热情学习毛主席著作的动人景象，到处都响彻着朗读毛主席语录的声音。我国人民更广泛更深入地学习毛泽东思想的群众运动，是无产阶级革命历史上空前未有的创举，是我国取得社会主义革命和社会主义建设胜利的根本保证。
    毛泽东思想是我们的指路明灯。干革命，搞建设，靠的就是毛泽东思想。
    林彪同志说，为了把毛泽东思想真正学到手，要反复学习毛主席的许多基本观点，有些警句甚至要背熟，反复学习，反复运用。广大群众在学习毛主席著作运动中，根据林彪同志的指示，形成了读毛主席语录，用毛主席语录的热潮。他们迫切希望，使毛主席语录家喻户晓，到处传诵。革命的音乐工作者为了满足群众的要求，为毛主席语录谱出了许多曲子。这是一种崭新的形式。正当国庆前夕，为了祝贺这伟大的节日，我们选登了劫夫同志和中央乐团谱写的十段语录曲，供同志们歌唱。
    运用各种文艺形式宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，这是革命文艺的根本任务。我们相信，在革命音乐工作者的努力下，高唱毛主席语录的歌声一定会响遍全国。这将使毛泽东思想更加深入人心，永远大放光芒。
