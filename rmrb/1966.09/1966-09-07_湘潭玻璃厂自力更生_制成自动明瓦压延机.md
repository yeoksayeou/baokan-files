Xiangtan Glass Factory Achieves Self-Reliance and Produces Automatic Flat Glass Drawing Machine

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, September 6th: The workers of Xiangtan Glass Factory in Hunan Province actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strive for self-reliance and work hard to overcome difficulties. They have successfully designed, manufactured, and installed an automatic flat glass drawing machine.

Last year, Xiangtan Glass Factory took on the task of producing a batch of flat glass. If they followed the old method of blowing, it would take a year and a half. The workers knew that flat glass is a building material, especially in demand in rural areas.

To complete this task quickly, efficiently, and economically, the workers, under the leadership of the Party, carried out technical innovations and technological revolutions. They took the initiative to create an automatic flat glass drawing machine. During the design process, the factory leadership led everyone to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and other articles. Everyone followed Chairman Mao's instructions, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." After a month of struggle, they designed the blueprint for the automatic flat glass drawing machine. Subsequently, the factory organized efforts to manufacture, test, and modify the design simultaneously. After five more months of effort, they finally produced the automatic flat glass drawing machine and put it into production. The machine's efficiency is four times higher than manual blowing, and the produced flat glass is evenly thick. The workers all say: The success of the automatic flat glass drawing machine is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which gave us wisdom and strength.

    湘潭玻璃厂自力更生
    制成自动明瓦压延机
    据新华社长沙六日电　湖南省湘潭市玻璃厂职工活学活用毛主席著作，自力更生、奋发图强，成功地设计、制造和安装了自动明瓦压延机。
    去年年底，湘潭市玻璃厂接受了生产一批明瓦的任务，如果按照老办法吹制，需要一年半时间。职工们知道明瓦是一种民用建筑材料，特别是农村需要量大。
    为了多快好省地完成这个任务，厂内职工在党的领导下，大搞技术革新和技术革命，自己动手创制自动明瓦压延机。在设计过程中，工厂领导带着大家一起学习《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等文章，大家遵照毛主席的指示，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”经过一个月的战斗，设计了自动明瓦压延机的蓝图。接着，工厂组织力量边制造，边试验，边修改设计。又经过五个月的努力，终于制成了自动明瓦压延机并投入生产。压延机的工效比人工吹制提高四倍，制出的明瓦厚薄均匀。职工们都说：自动明瓦压延机的成功，是毛泽东思想给了我们智慧和力量，是毛泽东思想的胜利。
