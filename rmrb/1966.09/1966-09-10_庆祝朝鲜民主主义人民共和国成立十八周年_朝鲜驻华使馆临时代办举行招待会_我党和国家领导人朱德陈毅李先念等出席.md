The acting charge d'affaires of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Jae-suk, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Party and state leaders Zhu De, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Liu Ningyi, Guo Moruo, and others were invited to attend the reception.

Kim Jae-suk, in his speech, introduced the achievements made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in various fields over the past 18 years. Kim Jae-suk said that the Korean people are determined to drive out the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces from South Korea and achieve the great cause of national reunification.

Kim Jae-suk said that the Korean people actively support the just struggle of the brotherly Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. The Korean people are determined to fight alongside the Vietnamese people to the end.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, in his speech, said that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have achieved new successes in the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and in the construction of socialism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that as long as U.S. imperialism does not withdraw, the struggle of the Korean people will not stop. The Chinese people have always firmly supported the just struggle of the brotherly Korean people for national reunification.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that at present, the revolutionary people of the world are facing a very good situation. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are flourishing. This is an irresistible historical tide that will sweep away the rule of imperialism throughout the world and thoroughly bury imperialism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese people are advancing bravely under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to build our country into a powerful socialist state. The workers, peasants, and soldiers of our country, as well as the broad cadres, regard the works of Comrade Mao Zedong as the guiding principles for all their work. A movement to study and apply the works of Comrade Mao Zedong has already borne rich fruits in all aspects of politics, economy, military, ideology, and culture, and has opened a new era in which the laboring people directly grasp and apply Marxism-Leninism. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, our country is carrying out an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. This is a struggle that touches the souls of people, a struggle to eradicate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology. It is a struggle to uproot revisionism. This cultural revolution is being carried out under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, and it is a great innovation in the international communist movement and a great innovation in the socialist revolution. Through this cultural revolution, we will thoroughly eliminate all the poisonous influences of the old ideology, old culture, old customs, and old habits created by all exploiting classes over thousands of years, and create and foster new ideology, new culture, new customs, and new habits among the broad masses of the people. This cultural revolution is greatly promoting the progress of our socialist cause and will undoubtedly have a profound and far-reaching impact on the present and future of the world revolution.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the peoples of China and Korea have forged a deep friendship through long-term joint struggles. This friendship is forged in blood and is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and cannot be destroyed by any force.
