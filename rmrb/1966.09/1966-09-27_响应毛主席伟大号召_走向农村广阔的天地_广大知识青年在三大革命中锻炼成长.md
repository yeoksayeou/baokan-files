In response to Chairman Mao's great call, batches of urban youth in our country have enthusiastically gone to the countryside, to the roaring revolutionary struggle, to implement the integration with the broad masses of workers and peasants, to take the road of revolutionization and laborization, and under the leadership of the Party, to contribute wisdom and strength to the construction of socialist new villages. Since 1962, more than a hundred million youth have gone to the countryside.

"All those intellectuals who can go to work in the countryside should gladly go there. The countryside is a vast expanse where one can achieve great things." This is the call made by our great leader Chairman Mao in 1955. Since then, every year, large batches of youth have gone to this vast expanse of the countryside, undergoing wind and rain in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. Especially in recent years, with the vigorous development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the countryside, more and more youth have gone to the countryside. Now, from the interior to the border regions, almost everywhere in the vast countryside, there are urban youth. They, together with the broad masses of workers and peasants in state farms, ranches, forest farms, fisheries, and people's communes, study politics, military affairs, culture, and technology, practice being both workers and peasants, both intellectuals and soldiers, and strive bravely to build a socialist new countryside, determined to temper themselves into a new generation of Mao Zedong's era in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The youth who have gone to the countryside in various places take Chairman Mao's works as their compass and steering wheel, seeking answers from Chairman Mao's works when encountering problems. They not only strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, but also actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically and actively help the surrounding workers and peasants to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The more than eighty youth in the Qingniang Reclamation Team of Changgui County, Hebei Province, have consistently insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and have achieved active study and application. All team members have written more than 1,500 articles on their experiences studying Chairman Mao's works. After two years of effort, this batch of youth has turned the originally barren Bohai coast into vast fertile rice fields and built a new village with initial scale. Now, this reclamation team has been rated as an advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works in Changgui County, Tangshan Prefecture, and Hebei Province.

Chairman Mao said: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually integrates with the broad masses of workers and peasants." Urban youth who have gone to the countryside follow this teaching of Chairman Mao, consciously integrating with the workers and peasants, learning the diligent, brave, and simple lifestyle of the workers and peasants, learning the firm stance and revolutionary qualities of the workers and peasants who are absolutely loyal to the Party and Chairman Mao, striving to reform themselves and raise their class consciousness in the three great revolutionary movements. A university student who settled in the Huapi Factory Brigade of Huapi Commune, Yongji County, Jilin Province, always regarded the process of integrating with the workers and peasants as the process of transforming his worldview. When he saw that the poor and lower-middle peasants could fearlessly speak out, he examined his own fear of offending people; when he saw some poor peasants jump into the river without hesitation to save the collective's cattle, he examined his own selfish and cowardly thoughts. During the socialist education movement, he saw the poor and lower-middle peasants bravely expose bad people and bad deeds, recalling the bitterness of the old society, and was deeply educated. The youth who have gone to the countryside have armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, transformed their worldview, and produced many heroes like Wang Jie and Liu Yingjun, such as Zhang Delong from Hunan and Jia Xiuzhang from Shandong, who are all heroes who sacrificed themselves bravely to rescue state property and defend the people.

Chairman Mao said: "We must make all the young people understand that our country is still a very poor country now, and it is impossible to fundamentally change this situation in a short period. It all depends on the youth and all the people uniting and struggling for several decades to create a prosperous and powerful country with their own hands." The youth who have gone to the countryside in various places remember this teaching of Chairman Mao, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, with the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, striving hard, and changing the poor and blank face of the motherland with their own hands. From Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Nanjing, and other big cities to Xinjiang to participate in agricultural reclamation construction, the youth, together with the old soldiers of the construction corps, have moved south and north of the Tianshan Mountains, built reservoirs and dug canals in the dry Gobi desert, reclaimed wasteland, built fields, and established a large number of new farms and factories, bringing new prosperity to the border of the motherland. In the past few years, the youth who have settled in the Daba Mountain area of Sichuan have built more than 400 small agricultural and forest farms and ranches. In the old revolutionary base areas of Jiangxi's Jinggangshan and Damaoshan, tens of thousands of youth have also built a number of reclamation farms and new villages. In the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Qinghai, in the low-lying saline-alkali areas of Shandong, Henan, and Hebei, and in the sparsely populated highlands of Tibet and the vast northern wastelands of Northeast China, there are also large numbers of youth bravely fighting to create a prosperous and powerful motherland.

The broad masses of youth enthusiastically participate in the socialist education movement in the countryside, tempering themselves in class struggle. Because they can consciously learn from the workers and peasants, temper themselves in actual struggles, they quickly learn the skills of labor, increase their abilities, raise their class consciousness, and are praised by the grassroots cadres and the broad masses as "able to write and fight," "both red and expert" good seeds, "reliable successors of the revolutionary cause." Many of them have grown into five-good members, five-good workers, Communist Party members, and brigade and team cadres, and some have been selected to serve as leaders at various levels in districts, communes, and state farms, forest farms, ranches, and fisheries.

A large number of youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought have also achieved outstanding results in spreading scientific and technological knowledge and conducting scientific experiments.

### 响应毛主席伟大号召　走向农村广阔的天地  广大知识青年在三大革命中锻炼成长

    响应毛主席伟大号召　走向农村广阔的天地
    广大知识青年在三大革命中锻炼成长
    据新华社二十五日讯　我国一批又一批的城市知识青年，热烈响应毛主席的号召，到农村中去，到轰轰烈烈的革命斗争中去，实行和广大的工农群众结合，走革命化、劳动化的道路，在党的领导下，为建设社会主义新农村，贡献智慧和力量。自一九六二年以来，全国有一百几十万知识青年上山下乡，走向农村。
      “一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”这是我们伟大领袖毛主席在一九五五年发出的号召。从这以后，各地每年都有大批知识青年，到农村这个广阔的天地中去，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三项伟大革命运动中经风雨，受锻炼。特别是近几年来，随着农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的蓬勃发展，上山下乡的知识青年越来越多。现在，从内地到边疆的广大农村，几乎到处都有来自城市的知识青年。他们同国营农场、牧场、林场、渔场和人民公社的广大工农群众一道学政治、学军事、学文化、学技术，实行亦工亦农，亦文亦武，为建设社会主义的新农村而英勇奋斗，决心在毛泽东思想的大学校里，把自己锻炼成为毛泽东时代的一代新人。
    各地上山下乡的知识青年，把毛主席著作当作指南针和方向盘，遇到问题就从毛主席著作中去找答案。他们不仅自己努力活学活用毛主席著作，坚决地照毛主席的指示办事，还积极宣传毛泽东思想，热情积极帮助周围工农群众活学活用毛主席著作。河北省昌黎县赤洋口青年垦荒队的八十多名知识青年，一直坚持学习毛主席著作，并且做到了活学活用。全体队员已先后写出一千五百多篇学习毛主席著作心得的文章。经过两年的努力，这批青年人把原来是一片荒芜的渤海海滩开垦成大片肥沃的稻田，建起了初具规模的新村。现在，这个垦荒队被评为昌黎县、唐山专区和河北省的学习毛主席著作先进集体。
    毛主席说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”城市下乡的知识青年遵照毛主席的这一教导，自觉地和工农群众结合在一块，学习工农群众勤劳勇敢、艰苦朴素的作风，学习工农群众立场坚定、对党和毛主席无限忠诚的革命品质，在三大革命运动中努力改造自己，提高自己的阶级觉悟。在吉林省永吉县桦皮厂公社桦皮厂大队落户的一位大学生，到农村后一直把和工农群众结合的过程，看作是脱胎换骨改造世界观的过程。当他看到贫下中农能够大公无私地提意见时，就检查自己有怕得罪人的思想；当他看见有的贫农社员毫不犹疑的跳到河里救集体的牛时，就检查自己当时怕这怕那而没去作的自私自利思想。在社会主义教育运动中，他看到贫下中农大胆揭露坏人坏事，忆旧社会的阶级苦，更深深地受到了教育。下乡青年用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，改造了世界观，出现了不少王杰、刘英俊式的英雄人物，如湖南的张德龙、山东的贾秀章等，就都是为抢救国家财产和保卫人民而英勇牺牲的英雄。
    毛主席说：“要使全体青年们懂得，我们的国家现在还是一个很穷的国家，并且不可能在短时间内根本改变这种状态，全靠青年和全体人民在几十年时间内，团结奋斗，用自己的双手创造出一个富强的国家。”各地上山下乡的知识青年牢记毛主席的这个教导，不怕苦，不怕累，以愚公移山的精神，艰苦奋斗，用自己的双手改变祖国一穷二白的面貌。从北京、上海、天津、武汉、南京等大城市到新疆参加农垦建设的知识青年，随着建设兵团的老战士们转战天山南北，在干旱的戈壁滩上修库挖渠，垦荒造田，办起了大批新农场和新工厂，为祖国边疆带来了新的繁荣。在四川大巴山区落户的知识青年，几年来兴建起小型农林场、牧场四百多个。在江西井冈山、大茅山革命老根据地落户的几万名知识青年，也建设了一批垦殖场和新村。在内蒙古、宁夏、青海的广阔的草原，在山东、河南、河北的低洼盐碱地带，在地广人稀的西藏高原、东北的北大荒，也都有大批知识青年，在为创造富强的祖国而英勇奋战。
    广大知识青年踊跃地参加农村社会主义教育运动，在阶级斗争中锻炼自己。由于他们能够自觉地向工农群众学习，在实际斗争中锻炼，很快就学到了劳动的本领，增长了才干，提高了阶级觉悟，被基层干部和广大群众誉为“能文能武”、“又红又专”的“好苗子”，“可以信赖的革命事业接班人”。他们中不少人已经成长为五好社员、五好职工、共产党员和社、队干部，有的已被选拔到区、社和国营农场、林场、牧场、渔场担任各级领导职务。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的大批知识青年，在传播科学技术知识，进行科学实验方面也取得了出色成绩。
