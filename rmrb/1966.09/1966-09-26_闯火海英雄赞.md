Edition: 3

The continents are in turmoil, the seas are in chaos,
In the era of Mao Zedong, heroes emerge.
Oil workers toil day and night,
For the country's construction, they race against time, enduring hardships.
They dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire,
The heroes are fearless, their spirits soaring, their hearts ablaze.
They prioritize revolutionary interests as their first priority,
For the people, they are willing to sacrifice their lives, their loyalty is boundless. (Recitation)

A few months ago, the oil workers of the 32111 drilling team, following Chairman Mao's instructions to find gas and oil, traversed mountains and rivers, fighting in the south and north. They said: "We have Chairman Mao's instructions engraved in our minds, melted into our blood, and implemented in our actions." They solemnly vowed to Chairman Mao and the Party: "If we do not complete the task of finding gas and oil, we will die on the drilling platform and be buried in the oil field." After a month of struggle, in a new structure where bourgeois "authorities" believed there was no natural gas, they drilled the first gas well and captured a "big gas tiger." On the morning of June 22, 1966, at 1:00 AM, the oil workers of the 32111 team were conducting well closure and pressure testing. Soon, this newly drilled high-yield gas well would serve socialist construction. The oil workers, with eyes wide open, watched the wellhead. The "gas tiger" trapped in the well surged out violently. The pressure gauge needle moved rapidly—(song lyrics)

Boom! Suddenly, a thunderous roar shook the heavens and earth,
A seamless steel pipe suddenly burst, like an earthquake and landslide,
High-pressure natural gas gushed out from the explosion,
The fierce gas flow was like a hurricane,
The explosion-proof lamps on the well site were shattered by the gas flow,
In an instant, a raging fire blazed,
The fire was fifty meters wide,
The flame towered higher than a ten-story building,
In the blink of an eye, a forty-meter-high steel well frame was burned down,
The diesel engine melted and deformed.
Trees within dozens of meters turned to ashes,
Rocks on the hillside within dozens of meters were scorched red.
Forty miles away, the firelight flickered,
Twenty miles away, the thunderous roar could be heard,
The hurricane-like gas flow and fire waves were ferocious,
Sweeping across the well site, rampaging in the air and on the ground. (Dialogue)

Fiery flames can destroy steel,
But they cannot destroy the red hearts of the oil workers;
Fiery flames can destroy rocks,
But they cannot destroy the indomitable spirit of the oil workers.
Each one stood firm at their post,
Everyone fought bravely,
To extinguish the fire,
To protect the gas well,
To protect state property,
This was their shared resolve,
To live for the revolution, to die for the revolution,
To trample mountains of knives and extinguish seas of fire,
To dedicate their lives to the ideal of communism! (Rap)

The demobilized soldier Zhang Yongqing,
At this moment, it was as if he were charging on the battlefield,
He thought that extinguishing the sea of fire was a battle,
He must firmly guard his post like a screw,
His heart was fixed on the wellhead,
The Communist Party member stood tall and fearless, unafraid of sacrifice!
He wanted to divert the natural gas out of the well site,
He dashed forward in giant strides towards the valve,
But the surging flames and fierce gas flow,
This hero was knocked down into the roaring flames.
Just as Zhang Yongqing fell,
The driller Wang Ping rushed forward,
The flames struck him down under the well frame,
He was truly a steadfast proletarian warrior with a red heart:
He stood up firmly from the ground,
His body ablaze, he charged again,
He wished he could extinguish the fire with a single breath,
He wished he could swallow the fire into his belly,
Stretching out his hands, he lunged forward,
Wang Ping was also engulfed in the flames!

There were also Luo Huatai, Wang Zuming, Deng Muquan,
Wu Zhongqi, four heroes who were extremely responsible and passionate about the revolution,
Loyal and steadfast, they guarded their posts, unmoved,
Fighting bravely against the flames, they sacrificed their lives gloriously. (Song lyrics)

Ah! The death of the six heroes is heavier than Mount Tai,
Their revolutionary spirit soars like a rainbow,
No matter how big the fire, it cannot match the spirit of the revolutionary workers,
No matter how red the fire, it cannot match the red hearts of the workers loyal to Mao Zedong Thought.
The selfless sacrifice of the martyrs,
Inspires the heroes fighting in the sea of fire. (Rap)

The heroes knew there were tigers in the mountains,
But they marched towards the tiger mountains;
They knew the flames were fierce,
But they charged into the sea of fire.
One batch fell, another batch rushed forward to continue the struggle.
Huang Chenghou endured intense pain, his hands twisting the valve wheel,
Unafraid of the wheel burning hotter than fire.
Ran Shurong, despite being seriously injured, did not leave the front line,
He rushed into the fire twice to rescue his comrades.
Zhang Zhongmin, despite being severely burned, forgot the pain,
He wanted to quickly find the source of the fire,
Staggering in the fire, he searched everywhere,
His comrades tried to carry him out of the fire, but he refused,
He said: "Don't worry about me, quickly close the number three valve."

To extinguish the flames, to cut off the source of the fire, one must be fearless. (Song lyrics)

At this moment, shouts echoed from all directions,
The workers from the dormitories, hearing the explosion,
Jumped over hills and leaped over ditches to rush to the fire,
Like tigers descending from the mountains, they moved swiftly,
The urgent situation and the firelight were their commands,
They charged towards the most dangerous spots.
Everyone felt that Chairman Mao was by their side,
The great leader Mao Zedong was personally directing this fire-fighting battle.
"Comrades, charge!" said the deputy instructor Lei Hongbin,
He led the charge into the fire, attacking fiercely.
Lei Hongbin had just rushed into the well site,
He was blown out of the fire by a powerful gas flow and fainted in a mud pit.
He regained consciousness and stood up,
He charged into the fire again,
Several times he was blocked by the gas flow,
It seemed impossible to rush to close the number three valve.
Suddenly, he remembered Chairman Mao's teachings,
In battle, one must be both brave and flexible,
I must act according to the situation.
He led everyone to the right side of the well site,
He thought that opening the vent valve would reduce the fire.
Lei Hongbin rushed to within a short distance of the number eight valve,
He felt dizzy, his heart pounded, and stars flashed before his eyes,
He was knocked down by the hydrogen sulfide gas,
His comrades carried him out of the raging fire.
Lei Hongbin regained consciousness and opened his eyes,
He saw that the fire on the well site had not subsided.
Lei Hongbin, forgetting his pain,
Thought of his comrades on the well site,
Thought of state property and the gas well,
And the difficulties in the struggle, the cadres should lead the charge.
I must remember Chairman Mao's teachings,
I must dedicate my limited life to the endless service to the people.
As long as my breath does not stop,
I will persist to the last minute.
Lei Hongbin thought this and stood up firmly,
He charged into the fire again.
At the same time, Hu Debin and a few others arrived,
With water hoses, they opened a path,
Shouting, "The number three valve is the most important,
We will take on the responsibility of closing it."
Before the words were finished, many comrades rushed towards the number three valve,
But the scorching valve wheel was too tight,
The workers used tools to turn the valve,
They bent the large wrench, and the valve turned a few times.
Hu Debin hugged the water hose, choked by smoke and heat,
The hydrogen sulfide made it hard to breathe, it was unbearable,
Suddenly, his vision went black, and he fainted,
He regained consciousness and looked around,
Batch after batch rushed in, one after another was carried out,
The flames were still raging high.
He remembered the great leader Mao Zedong's teachings: (Interlude)
"Resolutely fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, strive for victory." (Song)
In an instant, his blood boiled.
Now is the time to test my resolve, (Interlude)
Life is precious, but the Party's cause is more precious.
As long as I have a breath, I will not waver.
I must close the number three valve well,
Together, we will definitely extinguish the fire.
Thinking this, he struggled to stand up with his comrades,
Into the fire, like close combat with bayonets.
They finally closed the valve, and the fire subsided,
The "gas tiger" no longer roared.
As soon as the number three valve was closed,
The pressure at the wellhead surged upwards,
If the wellhead exploded,
The dozens of tons of drilling tools would fly into the sky, causing disaster,
The entire gas field would be destroyed,
Hundreds of firefighting comrades would suffer heavy casualties!

The Young Pioneer Wang Youfa,
Quickly rushed towards the fire net,
Grabbed a blanket to cover the wellhead,
The wet blanket quickly burned through.
He grabbed another blanket and rushed to cover it,
But it was still hard to stop the fire.
Wang Youfa rushed back and forth several times,
Boiling water-like water flowed under his feet.
The fire scorched him, the angle iron burned him,
He trembled all over, his heart pounded,
He could hardly hold on,
Facing the life-or-death moment, he spoke to himself:
You, an orphan from the old society, can have today,
All thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao raising you.
Without the Party, there would be no Wang Youfa,
I will not disappoint the Party's nurturing.
Today, even if I sacrifice myself, it is a worthy death,
To dedicate one's life to the people's cause is right and proper.
Thinking this, he grabbed another wet blanket,
Rushed to the well frame again,
Trying to throw the blanket over the wellhead,
The well was high, the blanket was heavy, he tried several times but failed to cover it.
At this moment, he remembered Chairman Mao's warm instructions: (Recitation)
"This army possesses an indomitable spirit, it must trample all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight."
This battle cry gave him boundless courage and strength.
He stood up straight,
Wrapped the blanket around himself and shouted loudly:
Fiery flames, burn! Burn!
Saying this, he covered the wellhead with the blanket and himself.
Wang Youfa's face did not change, his heart did not flutter,
He vowed to live and die with the wellhead.
At this moment, the crowd rushed up,
Rescued Wang Youfa from the fire scene.
Comrades covered the wellhead with wet blankets,
Poured in baskets of heavy crystal powder,
Finally, they saved the big gas well,
Fighting together, pursuing victory with greater confidence.
After a life-and-death struggle in a fierce battle,
They finally extinguished the raging fire! (Chorus)

The 32111 drilling team,
Their heroic deeds are brilliant and glorious,
With their blood and lives, they protected state property,
In thirty minutes, they extinguished the great fire.
They are collective Huang Jiguang, collective Qiu Shaoyun,
Collective Ouyang Hai, collective Mai Xiande!
They are loyal to the country and the Party,
Their red hearts are tempered into steel.
They are loyal to Chairman Mao,
Singing a victory song of Mao Zedong Thought to the four corners of the world! (Recitation)

This heroic collective regards reading Chairman Mao's books as their first need in life, turns Mao Zedong Thought into their soul, turns executing Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious actions, and regards revolutionary interests as their first priority. (Chorus)

Oil workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought,
Are the bravest, most selfless, most intelligent, and most united;
Oil workers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought,
Have the greatest ideals and the spirit of sacrifice;
Oil workers educated by Mao Zedong Thought,
Have the greatest fighting spirit and can dedicate themselves to the revolution;
Oil workers nourished by Mao Zedong Thought,
Can completely and thoroughly serve the people.
Mao Zedong Thought shines with boundless brilliance,
Mao Zedong Thought is the red sun that illuminates the earth. (Recitation)

Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the people, it will become a great material force, with fighting spirit, vibrant spirit, daring to descend into the sea of fire, daring to climb mountains of knives, daring to think, dare to do, dare to break through, climbing peaks, creating miracles, establishing merits for the country, for the world!

    闯火海英雄赞（唱词）
    五洲激荡，四海翻腾，
    毛泽东时代出英雄。
    石油战士日夜奋战，
    为祖国建设争分夺秒宿露餐风，
    刀山敢上，火海敢闯，
    英雄们无所畏惧志壮心红，
    以革命利益为第一生命，
    为人民舍生忘死无限忠诚。（朗诵）
    几个月以前，32111钻井队的石油战士，执行毛主席向石油工人发出的找气找油的指示，翻山越岭，转战南北。他们说：“我们把毛主席的指示，印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”他们庄严地向毛主席和党宣誓：“不完成找气找油的任务，我们死也要死在钻台上，埋也要埋在油田里。”经过一个月的奋战，在资产阶级“权威”认为根本没有天然气的新构造上，打开了第一口气井，捉住了一只大“气老虎”。一九六六年六月二十二日凌晨一时，32111队的石油战士们，正在进行关井测压，眼看这口新打的高产大气井，很快就可以为社会主义建设服务了。石油战士们，个个像在战场发起冲锋那样，瞪圆着眼睛，注视着井口，关在井里的“气老虎”猛力外冲，只见压力表上的指针迅速移动——（唱词）
    轰！猛然一声巨响惊天动地，
    一节无缝钢管突然破裂就像地裂山崩，
    从爆破口冲出高压天然气，
    强烈气流异常凶猛好似飓风，
    井场上防爆灯泡被气流冲破，
    刹时间引起了大火熊熊。
    火海宽达五十米，
    火柱高过楼十层，
    眨眼间四十米高钢铁井架被烧倒，
    柴油机溶化变了形。
    几十米外大小树木成灰烬，
    几十米外山坡岩石被烧红。
    四十里外看见火光闪闪，
    二十里外听见雷鸣般的响声，
    飓风般气流火浪真凶猛，
    横扫井场在空中在地上横冲直撞咆哮翻腾。（对口词）
    烈火能烧毁钢铁，
    烧不毁石油战士的颗颗红心；
    烈火能烧毁岩石，
    烧不毁石油工人坚强的灵魂。
    个个坚守岗位，
    人人奋不顾身，
    扑灭大火，
    保卫气井，
    保卫国家财产，
    是他们共同的决心，
    生为革命生，
    死为革命死，
    踏平刀山灭火海，
    为共产主义理想誓献终身！（快板）
    转业军人张永庆，
    这时节就好像战场打冲锋，
    他心想扑灭火海就是战斗，
    一定要坚守岗位像颗螺丝钉，
    把心拧在井口上，
    共产党员顶天立地何惧牺牲！
    他想把天然气引出井场外，
    飞起箭步直奔闸门往前冲，
    无奈那火浪滚滚气流猛，
    这英雄被冲倒在烈焰腾腾的火海中。
    张永庆刚刚倒下去，
    司钻王平紧跟着往上冲，
    火浪猛得把他击倒在井架下，
    他不愧无产阶级战士骨硬心红：
    坚强地又从地上站起来，
    满身带火再冲锋。
    他恨不得一口气把大火吹灭，
    恨不得张开口把大火吞入腹中，
    伸着双手向前扑，
    王平他也被吞没进烈火重重！
    还有那罗华太、王祖明、邓木
    全、吴仲启，对革命极端负责、极端热忱的四
    英雄，忠心耿耿坚守岗位屹然不动，与烈火英勇搏斗光荣牺牲。（唱词）
    啊！六英雄的死比泰山重，
    革命气概贯长虹，
    火再大，没有革命工人的志气大，
    火再红，没有忠于毛泽东思想的工人思想红，
    烈士们忘我牺牲的伟大行动，
    鼓舞着火海中奋战的众英雄。（快板）
    英雄们明知山有虎，
    偏向虎山行；
    明知烈火猛，
    偏向火海冲。
    一批人倒下去，
    又一批人冲上去继续斗争。
    黄成厚忍着剧痛双手去把闸轮拧，
    何惧那闸轮烧得比火红。
    冉树荣身负重伤不下火线，
    二次冲进火海去营救阶级弟兄。
    张仲珉满身烧伤忘记疼痛，
    一心想快把火源来搞清，
    摇摇晃晃在火海中到处探索，
    同志们背他出火海他坚决不答应，
    他说道：“莫要管我，快关三号闸门。”
    灭火焰，断火源，必须奋不顾身。（唱词）
    这时候四面八方喊声雷动，
    原来是宿舍的工人听到爆炸声，
    他们逢坡跳坡逢坎跳坎奔来救火，
    就好像猛虎下山快步如风，
    情况紧急火光就是命令，
    哪里最危险就向哪里冲。
    每个人都感到毛主席就在自己身边，
    伟大统帅毛主席亲自在指挥这场灭火斗争。
    “同志们，冲啊！”
    说话的人是副指导员雷洪炳，
    他带头奔向火海往前猛攻。
    雷洪炳刚刚闯入井场，
    被一股强大的气流冲出火海晕倒在泥坑。
    他苏醒过来挺身站起，
    二次又向火海冲，
    几次入火海都被气流阻挡，
    看情况抢关三号闸门是不可能。
    忽然想起毛主席的教导，
    在战斗中既要勇敢也要灵活机动，
    我要见机而行。
    他带领大家转向井场的右侧，
    他心想打开放喷闸门火势必减轻。
    雷洪炳冲到距离八号闸门不甚远，
    只觉得头晕心跳眼前冒金星，
    他被那硫化氢毒气熏倒在地，
    阶级弟兄背他闯出烈火重重。
    雷洪炳苏醒过来睁眼看，
    见井场的火势未减轻。
    雷洪炳当时忘了身上的剧痛，
    他想到的是井场上的阶级弟兄，
    他想到的是国家财产和气井，
    和困难斗争干部应当带头打先锋。
    我一定牢记毛主席的教导，
    我一定把有限的生命投入无限的为人民服务之中。
    只要我的呼吸不停止，
    我要坚持到最后一分钟。
    雷洪炳想到这里坚强地站起来，
    再接再厉又冲向火海中。
    在同时胡德炳几人也赶到，
    手持水龙打开路一条，
    大喊一声三号闸门最重要，
    关掉它的重担我们挑。
    话未完很多同志往三号闸门跑，
    那知道滚烫的手轮太坚牢，
    工人们手拿工具把闸门拧，
    扳弯了大管钳闸门才转了两遭。
    胡德炳抱着水龙烟熏火又烤，
    硫化氢呛得呼吸困难实在难熬，
    猛然间眼前发黑不觉昏倒，
    苏醒过来睁眼往左右瞧，
    一批批的冲上去一个个背下来，
    仍然是烈焰腾腾火势高。
    他想起伟大领袖毛主席的教导：（夹白）
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”（唱）
    顿时间浑身热血在燃烧。
    现在是考验我的时刻到，（夹白）
    生命虽然宝贵，党的事业更宝贵。
  （唱）
    只要我还有口气就坚决不动摇。
    一定把三号闸门关闭好，
    齐心合力定叫它火灭烟消。
    想到此挣扎站起和同志们一道，
    入火海好似近战拚刺刀。
    他们终于关好闸门火势减弱，
    气老虎顿时不再咆哮。
    三号闸门刚关上，
    井口压力骤然往上长，
    如果井口一爆炸，
    井下几十吨钻具飞上天空会起祸殃，
    整个气田都要被破坏，
    几百个救火的阶级弟兄也会遭受大伤亡！
    共青团员王有发，
    迅速扑向火力网，
    抓起被子盖井口，
    湿棉被很快烧透膛。
    他二次抓起棉被又去盖，
    还是难把火阻挡。
    王有发出出进进好几趟，
    开水般的积水脚下淌。
    烈火烤着他，角铁烙着他，
    疼的他浑身发抖心发慌，
    眼看难以支持住，
    面临着生死关头他对自己把话讲：
    你这个旧社会雇工的孤儿能够有今天，
    全是党和毛主席抚育你成长。
    没有党就没我王有发，
    我决不辜负党的培养。
    今天即使牺牲我是死得其所，
    为人民的事业献出生命理所应当。
    想到此他又抓起一条湿棉被，
    再次冲到井架旁，
    想把棉被投上去盖住井口，
    井高棉被重，投了几次没盖上。
    这时他想起毛主席亲切教导声：（白）
    “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”
    这一战斗号召给他增添了无穷的勇气和力量。
    他唰地一下挺起身，
    把棉被往身上一裹高声嚷：
    烈火呀，你烧吧！你烧吧！
    说着话，连人带被子堵到井口上。
    王有发面不改色心不跳，
    誓与井口共存亡。
    这时候群众赶上来，
    奋力把王有发抢救出了火场。
    同志们把一条条湿棉被子盖井口，
    又倒上重晶石粉一筐筐，
    终于保住这口大气井，
    齐奋战，乘胜追击信心更强。
    经历了生死搏斗的一场大恶战，
    终于把冲天大火扑灭光！（合唱）
    32111钻井队，
    英雄事迹灿烂辉煌，
    用鲜血用生命保护国家财产，
    三十分钟扑灭了大火一场。
    他们是集体的黄继光，集体的邱少云，
    集体的欧阳海，集体的麦贤得！
    他们忠于祖国忠于党，
    红心烈火炼精钢。
    忠于领袖毛主席，
    奏一曲毛泽东思想胜利凯歌传四方！（朗诵）
    这个英雄的集体，把读毛主席的书看作生活第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席指示变为自觉的行动，把革命利益当作是第一生命。（合唱）
    毛泽东思想武装起来的石油战士，
    最勇敢、最无私、最机智、最齐心；
    毛泽东思想哺育的石油战士，
    最有远大理想最有牺牲精神；
    毛泽东思想教育的石油战士，
    最有战斗力最能为革命献身；
    毛泽东思想滋养的石油战士，
    最能够完全彻底为人民。
    毛泽东思想光芒万丈，
    毛泽东思想是普照大地的红日一轮。（朗诵）
    毛泽东思想一旦为人们所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量，斗志昂扬，精神振奋，火海敢下，刀山敢上，敢想敢干，敢闯敢拚，攀登高峰，创造奇迹，为祖国，为世界，建立功勋！
