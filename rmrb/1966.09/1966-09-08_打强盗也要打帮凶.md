A robber with a big knife bursts into a peasant's home to kill, and the people, filled with rage, grab their knives to give him a blow to the head. Just as this robber is being beaten to a pulp, out comes a "peacemaker." He tells the people beating the robber, "How can you retaliate? If he gets desperate, he might use an atomic bomb. Be patient! Be peaceful! Coexist!" The people see at a glance: this "peacemaker" is the robber's number one accomplice!

The U.S. imperialists, who have sent hundreds of thousands of troops to invade Vietnam, are killers. The Soviet revisionist leadership, playing the role of "peacemaker," is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

Strike the robbers and their accomplices; oppose U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

Chairman Mao says, "Anyone who stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism is a counter-revolutionary." U.S. imperialism is the enemy of the people of the world. The Soviet revisionists have become friends with the enemy of the people of the world, and thus they have become the enemy of the people of the world.

On the surface, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism seem different: one is labeled "imperialist," the other "revisionist"; one acts openly, the other secretly; one bombs from the sky, the other pulls from the ground; one puts on a fierce face, the other wears a smiling face. However, their reactionary essence is the same. They are united in their anti-communism, anti-people, anti-revolution, and opposition to the new China that adheres to Marxism-Leninism.

The Soviet revisionists are a cunning and vicious bunch who are skilled in playing both sides. They shout "anti-imperialism" but collude with U.S. imperialism; they shout "revolution" but act counter-revolutionary; they shout "joint action" but betray the Vietnamese people; they shout "unity" but cause division. They play a role that U.S. imperialism cannot. They are traitors to the international communist movement, parasites of the working class, and scum within the revolutionary ranks. We must not engage in any "joint action" with them. We must thoroughly expose the traitorous faces and the faces of class enemies, and engage in a struggle against them head-on.

The communiqué of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee points out: "To oppose imperialism, we must oppose modern revisionism. In the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, there is no middle road to take." This is our correct direction for progress, the guiding ideology for our actions, the summary of our struggle experience, and the scientific truth of revolution!

### 打强盗也要打帮凶

    打强盗也要打帮凶
    一个强盗拿着大刀闯进老乡家里去杀人，人们怒不可忍，也拿起刀来给他个迎头痛击。正当这个强盗被打得焦头烂额的时候，跑出来一个
  “和事佬”，他向打强盗的人说：“你们怎么能回手？要是人家被打急了，搬出原子弹来可不得了，忍着点吧！和平吧！共处吧！”人们一眼就看出：这个“和事佬”是杀人强盗的不折不扣的头号帮凶！
    派了几十万大兵侵入越南的美帝国主义，就是杀人的强盗。充当“和事佬”角色的苏联修正主义领导集团，就是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。
    打强盗也要打帮凶；反对美帝也要反对苏修。
    毛主席说：“什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”美帝是世界人民的死敌，苏修同世界人民的死敌交了朋友，它也就成了世界人民的敌人了。
    从表面上看，美帝和苏修好像不大相同：一个是“帝”字号，一个是“修”字号；一个明着干，一个暗里帮；一个天上炸，一个地下拉；一个装凶相，一个扮笑脸……。然而，他们的反动本质是一样的，他们反共、反人民、反革命、反对坚持马列主义的新中国是一致的。
    苏修这一伙，是惯于玩弄两面手法的阴险毒辣的家伙。他们喊的是“反帝”，干的是勾结美帝；喊的是“革命”，干的是反革命；喊的是“联合行动”，干的是出卖越南人民；喊的是“团结”，干的是分裂。他们起了美帝国主义所不能起到的作用。他们是国际共产主义运动的叛徒，是工人阶级的蟊贼，是革命队伍里的败类。我们决不能和他们搞什么“联合行动”，我们一定要彻底揭露这一伙叛徒的嘴脸、工贼的面目，跟他们进行针锋相对的斗争。
    党的八届十一中全会公报指出：“要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。在马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义的斗争中，决没有中间道路可走。”这就是我们前进的正确方向，行动的指导思想，斗争的经验总结，革命的科学真理！
