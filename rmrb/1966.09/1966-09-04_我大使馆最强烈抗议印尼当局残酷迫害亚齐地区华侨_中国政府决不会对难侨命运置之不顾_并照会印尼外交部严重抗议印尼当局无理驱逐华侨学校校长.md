The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia on August 31 sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing deep indignation at the mass expulsion of overseas Chinese in Aceh, North Sumatra, and lodging the strongest protest with the Indonesian government.

The note pointed out that overseas Chinese residing in various ports in the Aceh region, due to inhuman persecution and expulsion, have already had more than 3,100 people stranded in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra. They sent an emergency letter to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 29, appealing against this atrocity, and sent a copy of the letter to the Chinese Embassy.

The note made four urgent demands to the Indonesian government:

1. Immediately stop the crimes of expelling and persecuting overseas Chinese in Aceh and other parts of Indonesia, and prevent the situation from further escalating;
2. Quickly solve the food and accommodation problems of the distressed overseas Chinese who have been concentrated in Medan, provide necessary medicine and treatment, ensure their personal safety, and allow them to seek livelihoods locally;
3. Compensate for all property losses suffered by the distressed overseas Chinese;
4. Send ships to repatriate the distressed overseas Chinese or immediately negotiate with China for the dispatch of ships to repatriate them, so that the distressed overseas Chinese can return to their homeland as soon as possible.

The note, using the example of Blang Jering in Aceh, exposed the extremely serious persecution suffered by overseas Chinese in this expulsion. The overseas Chinese in this place were forcibly gathered and imprisoned in a school from July 30 to August 3, for five days and four nights. The thugs subjected the detained overseas Chinese to exhaustive interrogations and arbitrary beatings. The local military and political authorities refused to stop these atrocities. Due to the collusion of local authorities with the thugs in various forms of coercion, the overseas Chinese lived in terror, their safety was not guaranteed, and they were forced to leave the country. After the distressed overseas Chinese were stranded in Medan, the right-wing forces and Kuomintang spies in Medan immediately began activities, continuing to persecute them and obstructing their return to their homeland.

The note pointed out that the large-scale expulsion of overseas Chinese in the Aceh region is the peak of a series of atrocities against overseas Chinese over the past few months and a major exposure of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' anti-Chinese conspiracy. The note further exposed this conspiracy using the example of Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh Province. The note pointed out that the overseas Chinese in this place were in a tense and terrifying atmosphere from early April to mid-August. The Indonesian authorities and thugs used vicious and despicable methods to persecute overseas Chinese, from illegal detention, interrogation, extortion, blackmail, insult, intimidation, kidnapping, beating, harassment, and destruction, to finally expulsion, leaving no stone unturned. The direct perpetrators of these atrocities included the commander of the First Military Region. The "KAMI" (Indonesian Youth Student Action Unity Organization) thugs were the direct executors. The Kuomintang bandits were the open and most favored assistants of the Indonesian right-wing. The so-called "Effective Loyalty Committee" formed by the Kuomintang bandits in early May was attached to the Defense Command in Banda Aceh.

The note emphasized that the actions of the Indonesian authorities in the Aceh region are naked fascist bandit behavior. Their anti-Chinese atrocities are even more brutal than the most cruel racism in South Africa.

The Chinese Embassy warned the Indonesian government in the note: "The Chinese government's dispatch of ships to repatriate the injured overseas Chinese is a sovereign right recognized by the world that cannot be deprived. We will never ignore the fate of tens of thousands of persecuted overseas Chinese. We will not rest until we achieve the goal of repatriating them."

The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on September 1, strongly protesting the Indonesian government's unjustified expulsion of overseas Chinese school principals in West Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan, pointing out that this is an extremely reactionary and unjustified anti-Chinese measure and another new step to worsen relations between the two countries.

The note said: "The Embassy solemnly demands that the Indonesian government immediately stop the persecution of overseas Chinese school principals and other overseas Chinese, immediately withdraw the order to expel overseas Chinese school principals, and ensure their right to reside and personal safety are not violated."

The note pointed out that since late June, the immigration offices in West Java, Sumatra, and Kalimantan have ordered some overseas Chinese school principals and their families to leave Indonesia within a deadline. When the relevant principals questioned the reason for their expulsion, these immigration officials had no answer, only saying: "This is an order from higher authorities."

The note pointed out that the principals of various overseas Chinese schools have long resided in Indonesia, some of whom were born in Indonesia, and many have already obtained permanent residence rights. They hold legal documents and have always complied with the regulations of the Indonesian government's foreign education supervision department, engaging in the educational administration of overseas Chinese schools, making active contributions to cultivating various talents serving the local area, and to cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and Indonesia. Their hard work and friendly attitude have always been praised by local public figures. What reason does the Indonesian government have to deprive them of their legal right to reside?

The note pointed out that the Indonesian government is the culprit in destroying relations between China and Indonesia, and has already been unanimously condemned by the world's just public opinion.

The note pointed out that the behavior of the Indonesian authorities, "violates the most basic principles of international relations and can only further demonstrate your extreme weakness, relying on fascist bullying to get by."

The note pointed out that the overseas Chinese school principals' statements of difficulties to the immigration authorities, requests to withdraw the order, and expressions that they cannot return to their country at their own expense unless the Indonesian government is responsible for their repatriation, are all very reasonable requests that should be given serious consideration by the Indonesian government.

The note finally pointed out, "If the Indonesian government insists on its own way, it will absolutely not be able to shirk the full responsibility for the consequences of taking this measure."

    我大使馆最强烈抗议印尼当局残酷迫害亚齐地区华侨
    中国政府决不会对难侨命运置之不顾
    并照会印尼外交部严重抗议印尼当局无理驱逐华侨学校校长
    新华社三日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆八月三十一日照会印度尼西亚外交部，就北苏门答腊亚齐地区大规模逼迁华侨的暴行表示无比的愤慨，并向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会指出，居住在亚齐地区各埠的华侨，由于受到惨无人道的迫害和逼迁，已经有三千一百多人流落在北苏门答腊首府棉兰。他们在八月二十九日从棉兰写紧急信件给印度尼西亚政府外交部长，对这一暴行提出了申诉，并将这封信件的副本送给中国大使馆。
    照会向印度尼西亚政府提出了四点紧急要求：
    一、立即停止在亚齐和印度尼西亚各地驱逐和迫害华侨的罪行，制止事态的继续扩大；
    二、迅速解决已集中在棉兰的受难华侨的食宿问题，供应必要的医药和治疗，保障他们的人身安全，并允许他们在当地谋求生计；
    三、赔偿受难华侨所遭受的一切财物损失；
    四、派船遣送受难华侨返回中国或立即就中国派船接侨进行谈判，使受难华侨能最迅速地返回自己的祖国。
    照会以中亚齐的打京岸为例，揭露在这次逼迁中华侨被极端严重迫害的情况。这个地方的华侨被强迫集中监禁在一所学校中，从七月三十日到八月三日，一连五天四夜。暴徒对被捕华侨进行疲劳审讯，恣意拷打。当地军政当局拒不制止这种暴行。由于地方当局协同暴徒进行百般胁迫，华侨生活于恐怖之中，生命安全得不到保障，不得不被迫离境。受难华侨流落到棉兰后，棉兰的右派势力和蒋匪特务马上展开活动，继续迫害他们，并阻挠他们返回祖国。
    照会指出，亚齐地区这次大规模逼迁华侨的活动，是几个月来一系列迫害华侨暴行的高峰，是印度尼西亚右派反动势力排华阴谋的大暴露。照会又以亚齐省首府班达·亚齐的情况为例，揭露了这个阴谋。照会指出，这个地方的华侨从四月初到八月中，一直处于紧张和恐怖的气氛之中。印度尼西亚当局和暴徒迫害华侨手段狠毒，作法卑劣，从非法扣押、审讯、敲榨、勒索、侮辱、恐吓、绑架、殴打、骚扰、破坏以至最后逼迁，无所不用其极。暴行的直接指挥者包括第一军区司令。“卡比”（“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”）暴徒是直接执行者。蒋匪帮分子是印度尼西亚右派的公开和最得宠的助手。蒋匪帮分子在五月初组成的所谓“效诚委员会”，附设在班达·亚齐的防卫司令部内。
    照会强调指出，印度尼西亚当局在亚齐地区的所作所为，是赤裸裸的法西斯匪盗行为，它的排华暴行，比之南非最残酷的种族主义有过之无不及。
    中国大使馆在照会中正告印度尼西亚政府：“中国政府派船接回受害华侨，是世界公认的一个主权国家不容剥夺的护侨权利，我们绝对不会对成千上万受迫害华侨的命运置之不顾，我们不达到接回他们的目的，决不罢休。”
    新华社三日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆九月一日照会印度尼西亚外交部，对印度尼西亚政府在西爪哇、苏门答腊、加里曼丹等地无理驱逐华侨学校校长提出严重抗议，指出这是极其反动无理的排华措施，是继续恶化两国关系的又一新步骤。
    照会说：“大使馆严正要求印度尼西亚政府，立即停止对华侨学校校长和其他华侨的迫害，立即撤回驱逐华侨学校校长的命令，保障他们的居留权利和人身安全不受侵犯。”
    照会指出，自六月下旬以来，西爪哇、苏门答腊、加里曼丹等地的移民厅，勒令当地的一些华侨学校校长和家属在限期内离开印度尼西亚。当有关的校长质问被驱逐的理由时，这些移民厅官员无辞以对，只说：“这是奉上级的命令行事”。
    照会指出，各地华侨学校的校长长期在印度尼西亚居留，其中有些人出生在印度尼西亚，许多人早已获得了永久居留的权利。他们执有合法证件，并一贯遵循印度尼西亚政府外侨教育监督部门的规定，从事华侨学校的教育行政工作，对培养服务于当地的各种人材，对中国和印度尼西亚两国人民之间的文化交流，作了积极的贡献。他们的辛勤工作和友好态度一向为当地公众人士所赞许。印度尼西亚政府有什么理由剥夺他们居留的合法权利呢？
    照会指出，印度尼西亚政府是破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国关系的罪魁祸首，业已受到全世界正义舆论的同声谴责。
    照会指出，印尼当局的这种行为，“违背了最起码的国际关系准则，只能再次表明你们十分虚弱，只有靠法西斯的霸道混日子。”
    照会指出，华侨学校校长向移民当局陈述困难，要求收回成命，并表明除非印度尼西亚政府负责遣送，自己无法自费回国，所有这些都是十分合情合理的要求，理应受到印度尼西亚政府的重视和考虑。
    照会最后指出，“如果印度尼西亚政府一意孤行，绝对推脱不了由于采取这一措施所应承担的全部责任。”
