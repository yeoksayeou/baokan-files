	Relying on Class Struggle to Build the Base
	— A Record of the Dingjia Brigade Party Branch Using Chairman Mao's Theory of Class Struggle to Educate Party Members and the Masses

	Editor's Note: The tree wants to be still, but the wind will not cease. In a society with classes, the waves of class struggle will never subside. Since the beginning of agricultural collectivization, for more than a decade, in the Dingjia Brigade, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads has never ceased. The landlords and rich peasants were overthrown, but their hearts are not dead. They always dream of destroying the socialist collective economy, usurping the leadership of the proletariat, realizing the restoration of capitalism, and restoring their lost "paradise."

	"Serious problems are the education of the peasants." Chairman Mao's scientific judgment has once again been vividly proven in the Dingjia Brigade. Over the past decade, the Dingjia Brigade Party Branch has focused its main efforts on educating the peasants, continuously carrying out the struggle between the two roads and two ideologies among the peasants, using Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle to arm the peasants, and firmly grasping the ideological revolutionization of the peasants. As the proletarian consciousness of the peasants has been raised, they firmly walk the socialist road. The schemes and tricks of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to change the situation have been easily exposed and smashed.

	The vast majority of party members and masses in the Dingjia Brigade have not lost their way in the waves of class struggle and have always firmly walked the socialist road. This is because they hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought. It is because the leaders of this brigade party branch have experienced deep suffering in the old society and have undergone severe tests of struggle. They never forget Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget the class oppression and exploitation of the old society, always maintaining a high degree of vigilance against class struggle.

	The Dingjia Brigade Party Branch of the Lujia Public Commune in Huang County, Shandong, is a party branch that is good at grasping class struggle. For more than a decade, they have always firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, using Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle to educate party members, cadres, and the masses. This party branch has withstood the test in the great waves of class struggle, leading the masses to overcome one after another of the adverse currents and rapids, achieving one victory after another, and making the Dingjia Brigade a red flag for the socialist revolution and socialist construction. As the party branch secretary Wang Yongxing said, "The Dingjia Brigade has relied on class struggle to build its base."

	Consistently Carrying Out the Struggle Between the Two Roads

	In Dingjia, from the period of collectivization to the present, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads has never ceased.

	In 1955, the second year of the establishment of seven primary agricultural cooperatives in Dingjia and eight other natural villages (then a township), although a good harvest of wheat was obtained, due to lack of management experience and other reasons, a part of the autumn crops suffered serious weed infestation. The class enemies saw an opportunity and spread rumors, saying things like, "The cooperative is good, the cooperative is good, the fields don't grow crops, only weeds grow, working during the day and arguing at night." The agents of the bourgeoisie who had infiltrated the party seized control of the village government, distributing all the relief grain and relief funds sent by the state to individual farmers. They wanted to strangle the cooperative in times of difficulty. The party branch organized party members and cadres to study party documents such as the general line for the transitional period, using methods such as recounting the sufferings of the old society and the sufferings of the small peasant economy to raise the consciousness of the masses, and repelled the first attack of the class enemies.

	It was in the autumn of that year that Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of agricultural collectivization inspired the broad masses of poor peasants in Dingjia. The seven primary cooperatives in the entire township united to form a higher-level agricultural production cooperative. By 1956, the per-acre grain yield of the entire cooperative had reached 665 jin, doubling the yield before collectivization, and the entire cooperative was filled with praise. However, the Dingjia Party Branch at that time still lacked experience in class struggle and had an insufficient understanding of the repetitiveness of class struggle, and thus relaxed vigilance. In the summer of 1957, the landlords, rich peasants, and other anti-socialist elements in Dingjia stirred up a storm. They incited the masses to demand grain and withdraw from the cooperative, wanting to take back farm tools and draft animals. At that time, there were also some people within the party who were pulled down. Facing the attack of capitalist forces, the party branch, according to the instructions of the higher party committee, strengthened class struggle education within the party, relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and launched a counterattack against the class enemies, carrying out a great debate throughout the cooperative, smashing the sabotage activities of the class enemies, and achieving victory in the second struggle.

	Chairman Mao said: "The agricultural cooperativization movement, from the very beginning, has been a serious struggle of thought and politics. Every cooperative, without going through such a struggle, cannot be established.... After the cooperative is established, it must go through many struggles before it can be consolidated. After it is consolidated, if it relaxes, it may collapse again." These words, after two serious struggles, sound so familiar! It is precisely Chairman Mao's precious instructions that have raised the awareness of class struggle in the Dingjia Party Branch, and in the subsequent struggles against the class enemies, they have achieved the third and fourth major victories, stopped the trend of individual farming, defended the people's commune, and in 1965, the per-acre grain yield reached 950 jin.

	The Serious Problem is the Education of the Peasants

	Arming the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, transforming the broad masses of small producers into new-type socialist peasants, is an important content of rural class struggle and a major task for rural party organizations.

	Dingjia is a poor mountainous area with "high mountains, thin soil, and many rocks." How can one shake off poverty and take the road to prosperity? Initially, opinions on this question were not consistent. Some people advocated relying on the mountains to eat from the mountains, cutting firewood and selling grass to increase income. Some people advocated making money by engaging in sideline businesses. The majority did not agree with these proposals. The party branch believed that the two different proposals reflected two different thoughts and two different roads in socialist construction, one being capitalist and the other socialist. The party branch repeatedly educated party members, cadres, and the masses, explaining to them that only by farming well and developing agricultural production can a solid foundation be laid for the collective economy.

	In 1957, Chairman Mao, inspired by the great feat of opening mountains and rivers and transforming nature by the people of Lijiazhuang in Juxian County, Shandong, issued the great call to "Move mountains like Yu Gong and transform China," which greatly inspired the people of Dingjia. That winter, a large-scale struggle to transform nature relying on self-reliance began in Dingjia.

	To be self-reliant, one must have a great ideal and be willing to pay a great price in labor. However, a part of the people, due to being constrained by the thoughts of small producers, often could not correctly understand the relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests. They were afraid of hardship and fatigue and wanted to retreat. Some said, "Working a piece of mountain land with a few hundred laborers is not worth it." "The next generation will have their own fortune, and we will not be the oxen for the next generation." The party branch organized the members to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions on "Moving mountains like Yu Gong and transforming China" and articles such as "Yu Gong Moves the Mountain," and carried out a great discussion among the members on whether to "calculate the big account or the small account," "to guard the business or to create the business," and "to repair and patch or to carry out a thorough revolution." Through study and discussion, people saw the beautiful future of socialism, their horizons broadened, and they established the thought of thorough revolution. After several years of arduous struggle, the people of Dingjia basically transformed the terraced fields by the river, at the foot of the mountain, and on the mountain slope to high standards, and also achieved water conservation on the transformed land, turning the thin land on the mountain top into stable and high-yielding fields.

	The fundamental problem of educating the peasants is to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the peasants' worldview. Since 1963, the Dingjia Party Branch has led the masses to carry out the activity of studying Chairman Mao's works. Now, the entire brigade has seven night schools and more than sixty study groups, and temporary groups are also formed according to production activities. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, the spiritual face of the broad masses of community members has undergone a great change. The thought of serving the people wholeheartedly, the thought of farming for revolution, the thought of shouldering heavy burdens, and the thought of being a new Yu Gong for socialism have been established in many community members. Selfishness, fear of hardship, love of enjoyment, and only caring about immediate interests have been greatly overcome.

	Vigilantly Preventing Peaceful Evolution

	Whether one can resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, prevent peaceful evolution, and ensure that the party will never change color is a serious test for rural grassroots party organizations. Over the past decade, the Dingjia Party Branch has well withstood this test and is indeed a stronghold of the party.

	The branch secretary Wang Yongxing, the deputy secretary and brigade leader Zhang Shuqin, and the deputy secretary Lü Wenhou, all came from poor backgrounds, participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and were tempered and grown in the fires of war, with strong revolutionary will. The other members of the party branch are also mostly communists who have suffered deep bitterness in the old society and have undergone long-term tests. It is these people who form the core of the brigade party organization. They never forget Chairman Mao's teachings and are highly vigilant against the class enemies.

	In 1950, Wang Yongxing returned home on disability after being seriously injured in the war, just after the two previous party branch secretaries had been one by one knocked down by the class enemies with sugar bullets. These two secretaries were pulled over by the class enemies, spending all day eating and drinking at the class enemies' homes, doing things for them, and becoming agents of the bourgeoisie within the party. Seeing this situation and remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on being vigilant against the sugar-coated bullets of the class enemies, Wang Yongxing heightened his vigilance. After taking up the position of party branch secretary, one day he returned home, and his wife told him that someone had sent some eggs, saying that because he had worked hard for everyone, a few eggs were sent to him to nourish his body. The person who sent the eggs was a bourgeois element who had been struggled against by the masses. Wang Yongxing immediately became alert. He thought, "In the past, this person did not care about me because I was just a poor soldier, and he had no use for me; now he sends eggs, because I have become a cadre, he can pull me over to serve him." Thinking of this, he angrily told his family, "These eggs are poisonous, we cannot eat them, or we will be deceived." He immediately sent the children back with the original items.

	The party branch found that sweet words and flattery are another important means by which landlords and the bourgeoisie corrupt party members and cadres. Once, a bourgeois element praised Wang Yongxing, saying, "Young and talented, without ambition, a hundred years is in vain." Wang Yongxing thought: Chairman Mao's words are indeed true, the bourgeoisie has come to flatter me. He told that bourgeois element, "I am a servant of the people, not an official of the old society, and I do not need you to flatter me like this."

	The party branch also found that landlords and rich peasants, by becoming sworn brothers and relatives with poor and lower-middle peasants, using clan relationships to blur class boundaries, is another important means by which class enemies corrupt party members, cadres, and poor and lower-middle peasants to achieve peaceful evolution. The militia company commander of Quanzhuang Village, poor peasant member Wang Liansheng, whose grandmother died, had a rich peasant aunt who was out of five generations of mourning suddenly came to burn paper and cry at the grave, appearing so close. In Dachenjia Village, an old landlord died, and some cadres and poor peasants went to help with the funeral as relatives, mourning for him. The party branch seized these incidents, held discussions throughout the brigade, and organized everyone to study "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," making everyone further realize that: all poor and lower-middle peasants in the world are our brothers; all landlords and rich peasants in the world are our enemies, whether they are dead or alive, they must be treated as class enemies, and boundaries must be drawn with them, otherwise, they will be deceived.

	Through these incidents, the party branch further realized that the old customs and habits left over from the old society are also serving the class enemies. The class enemies use these to corrupt cadres and the masses, making them lose their fighting spirit and walk the road of degeneration and degeneration. Therefore, the party branch vigorously promoted the reform of customs, advocated new marriage ceremonies and new funeral ceremonies, and generally advocated holding memorial services for community members who died, except for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

	Struggling with the Bourgeoisie for the Youth

	The Dingjia Party Branch places great importance on the cultivation and education of the younger generation. In recent years, the party branch has carried out the activity of studying Chairman Mao's works among the youth, calling on them to learn from Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande. The party and youth league branches often organize some poor and lower-middle peasants who have suffered deep bitterness to tell the youth the history of their families and villages, organizing the youth to visit the poor and ask about their hardships, making them never forget the bitterness of the old society, cherish today's happiness, never forget their roots, and never change.

	The party branch has taken many measures to ensure that the revolutionary spirit of hard work and creation of the older generation can be passed down forever. In the construction of water conservancy projects, they have planned to leave "historical sites" next to the terraced fields that have been transformed to preserve the original appearance; they have preserved a "historical well" from the mutual aid team period on the edge of a piece of land; in a piece of terraced field that has been leveled and made flat, they have preserved a "tree in the well." This tree, after the land was leveled, the trunk has fallen below the ground surface, and only the crown is exposed. To protect it, people built a well around the trunk, so it became a tree in the well. They use these things as living teaching materials to educate the younger generation, making the youth never forget the revolutionary spirit of hard work and creation of the older generation.

	Last year, during the drought-resistant wheat sowing, the use of reservoir water for gravity irrigation and water pumps to lift water had already successfully completed the sowing task. However, the party branch considered that a part of the youth had become accustomed to comfortable days and was afraid that they would forget the glorious tradition of hard struggle, so they decided that each production team should plant a few more acres of wheat. First, do not open the sluice gate, and second, do not move the machine, and specifically require the youth to carry water and sow wheat in drought resistance. After sowing, they organized the youth to have a discussion, making the youth deeply feel that: to take over the revolutionary cause well, one must have a strong thought of not fearing hardships and difficulties like the older generation, always listen to the party, listen to Chairman Mao, stand firmly on the proletarian position, and establish a communist worldview of completely and thoroughly serving the people.

	Due to the diligent cultivation of the party branch, a batch of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause has been trained in Dingjia. In the entire brigade, there are more than twenty young cadres above the production team level. They are selfless, stand firm, fear no difficulties, and are very popular among the masses. Among the 430-plus youth, there are more than 120 "five-good" community members. Recently, with the approval of the higher party committee, the party branch has accepted a batch of outstanding youth to join the Communist Party of China.

	× × ×

	Through long-term practice of class struggle, the Dingjia Brigade Party Branch deeply feels that class struggle is everywhere. There is class struggle in backward units and in advanced units; there is class struggle in times of difficulty and in times of smooth sailing; there is class struggle in places where there are many landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and there is class struggle in places where there are few or even no landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Therefore, one must never forget class struggle. In times of difficulty, when our work has some shortcomings or suffers some setbacks, class enemies often adopt direct attack methods; when our work achieves victory, they often adopt extremely hidden and indirect methods. Therefore, in dealing with class enemies, one must be both brave and wise.

	The Dingjia Brigade Party Branch believes that as long as one remembers Chairman Mao's teachings, class struggle is not only not frightening but is also the driving force for socialist construction. In class struggle, every victory achieved raises people's ideological consciousness by one step and pushes socialist construction forward by one step.

    靠阶级斗争起家
    ——记下丁家大队党总支用毛主席的阶级斗争学说教育党员和群众
    编者按：树欲静而风不止。在有阶级的社会中，阶级斗争的风浪，是永远不会停息的。从农业合作化开始，十几年来，在下丁家大队，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争一直没有间断过。地主和富农被推翻了。可是，他们人还在，心不死。他们总是妄想搞垮社会主义的集体经济，篡夺无产阶级的领导权，实现资本主义复辟，恢复他们失去的“天堂”。
    “严重的问题是教育农民。”毛泽东同志的这一科学论断，在下丁家大队又一次得到生动的证明。十多年来，下丁家大队党总支，把主要的精力用来教育农民，不断地在农民中间开展两条道路和两种思想的斗争，用毛主席关于阶级斗争的学说武装农民，狠抓农民的思想革命化。农民的无产阶级觉悟提高了，坚定地走社会主义道路，地富反坏右分子妄想变天的一切阴谋诡计，就很容易被识破、被粉碎。
    下丁家大队的绝大多数党员和群众，在阶级斗争的风浪中没有迷失方向，始终坚定地走社会主义道路，是因为他们毛泽东思想红旗举得高，是因为这个大队党总支的领导成员，在旧社会受过深重的苦难，又经过严重斗争的考验。他们时刻不忘毛主席的教导，不忘旧社会的阶级压迫和阶级剥削，对阶级斗争经常保持着高度的警惕。
    山东黄县大吕家公社下丁家大队党总支，是一个善于抓阶级斗争的党总支。十多年来，他们一直牢牢记住毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，用毛主席关于阶级斗争的理论教育党员、干部和群众。这个党总支在阶级斗争的大风浪里经受住了考验，领导群众越过了一个又一个的逆流险滩，取得了一个又一个的胜利，使下丁家大队成为社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一面红旗。正像党总支书记王永幸同志所说：“下丁家大队是靠阶级斗争起家的。”
      始终坚持两条道路的斗争
    在下丁家，从合作化时期到现在，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，一直没有间断过。
    一九五五年，是下丁家等八个自然村（当时是一个乡）的七个初级农业生产合作社成立的第二年，虽然夺得了小麦好收成，但是由于缺少管理经验等原因，一部分秋庄稼发生了严重的草荒。阶级敌人认为有机可乘，便大肆造谣，胡说什么：“合作社好，合作社好，地里不长庄稼光长草，白天干活黑夜吵。”钻进党内的资产阶级代理人，把持了村政权，把国家发来的救济粮、救济款全部分给了单干户，他们想在困难时刻把合作社卡死。党总支组织党员、干部学习了党的关于过渡时期的总路线等文件，用诉旧社会的苦、诉小农经济的苦等办法，提高了群众的觉悟，打退了阶级敌人的第一次进攻。
    就在这一年的秋天，毛主席《关于农业合作化问题》的指示，鼓舞了下丁家广大的贫苦农民。全乡七个初级社联合起来，组成了一个高级农业生产合作社。到一九五六年，全社粮食亩产量已经达到六百六十五斤，比合作化前增长两倍，全社上下一片叫好声。但是，当时的下丁家党总支，终究还缺乏阶级斗争的经验，对阶级斗争的反复性认识不足，因而一度放松了警惕性。一九五七年夏天，下丁家的地主、富农分子和其他反社会主义分子，又刮起了一股阴风。他们煽动群众闹粮、退社，要回农具和耕牛。当时，党内也有人被拉下水。面对资本主义势力的进攻，党总支根据上级党委的指示，在党内加强阶级斗争的教育，依靠贫下中农，向阶级敌人进行了反击，在全社开展了大鸣、大放、大辩论，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动，取得了第二次斗争的胜利。
    毛主席说：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。每一个合作社，不经过这样的一场斗争，就不能创立。……合作社建立以后，还必须经过许多的斗争，才能使自己巩固起来。巩固了以后，只要一松劲，又可能垮台。”这些话，在经过两场严重的斗争后，听来是多么亲切啊！正是毛主席的这一宝贵的指示，使下丁家党总支提高了阶级斗争的自觉性，在以后同阶级敌人的斗争中，取得了第三、第四次重大胜利，制止了单干风，保卫了人民公社，一九六五年粮食亩产量达到九百五十斤。
      严重的问题是教育农民
    用毛泽东思想武装农民的头脑，把广大小生产者改造成为社会主义的新型农民，是农村阶级斗争的一个重要内容，是农村党组织的一件大事。
    下丁家是一个“山高、地薄、石头多”的穷山区。怎样才能摆脱贫穷、走上富裕的道路呢？最初，人们对这个问题的看法很不一致。有些人主张靠山吃山，砍柴卖草增加收入。有的人主张靠搞副业做买卖发财。多数人不同意这些主张。党总支认为：两种不同的主张，反映了社会主义建设中的两种不同的思想、两条不同的道路，一种是资本主义的，一种是社会主义的。党总支对党员、干部和群众反复地进行了教育，向他们说明，只有把地种好，把农业生产搞好，才能给集体经济打下牢固的基础。
    一九五七年，毛主席就山东莒南县厉家寨人开山劈岭、治山治水的壮举，发出了“愚公移山，改造中国”的伟大号召，使下丁家人受到了极大的鼓舞。这年冬季，一个依靠自力更生的力量、大规模地改造自然的斗争，在下丁家开始了。
    要自力更生，就要有远大的理想，就要付出巨大的劳动。可是，有一部分人由于受小生产者思想的束缚，常常不能正确理解眼前利益和长远利益的关系。他们怕苦怕累，想打退堂鼓。有的说：“整一亩山岭薄地，用几百个工划不来。”“儿孙自有儿孙福，不给儿孙当马牛。”党总支组织社员反复学习了毛主席“愚公移山，改造中国”的指示和《愚公移山》等文章，在社员中开展了“是算大账还是算小账？”“是守业还是创业？”“是修修补补还是彻底革命？”的大讨论。通过学习和讨论，人们看到了社会主义的美好远景，眼界开阔了，树立了彻底革命的思想。经过几个年头的艰苦斗争，下丁家人把河旁、山根、山腰的梯田，基本上按高标准整治了一遍，并在整过的土地上实现了水利化，把山顶上的薄地也改造成稳产高产田。
    教育农民的根本问题，是用毛泽东思想改造农民的世界观。一九六三年以来，下丁家党总支就领导群众开展了学习毛主席著作的活动。现在，全大队已经有七处夜校、六十多个学习小组，另外还根据生产活动情况，临时组成小组学习。广大社员通过学习毛主席著作，精神面貌发生了巨大变化。全心全意为人民服务的思想，为革命种田的思想，拣重担子挑的思想，做社会主义新愚公的思想，已经在很多社员中树立起来。自私自利、怕苦怕累、贪图享乐、只顾眼前利益等思想，已经得到很大克服。
          严防和平演变
    能不能抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，防止和平演变，保证党永不变色，是对农村基层党组织的严重考验。十多年来，下丁家党总支很好地经受住了这种考验，不愧为党的坚强堡垒。
    总支书记王永幸，副书记兼大队长张书勤，副书记吕文厚，出身贫苦，参加过抗日战争和解放战争，是在战火中锻炼成长起来的、革命意志坚强的共产党员。党总支的其他委员，也大都是在旧社会苦大仇深、受过长期考验的共产党员。正是这样一些人组成了大队党组织的核心。他们时刻不忘毛主席的教导，对阶级敌人具有高度的警惕性。
    一九五○年，王永幸因为在战争中身负重伤复员回家，正是前两任党支部书记被阶级敌人用糖弹一个一个打倒以后。这两任支部书记，被阶级敌人拉过去，整天在阶级敌人家里吃吃喝喝，替人家办事，变成了资产阶级在党内的代理人。看到这种情况，想起毛主席关于要警惕阶级敌人的糖衣炮弹的教导，王永幸提高了警惕。在担任党总支书记以后，有一天他回到家里，妻子告诉他某人送来了一些鸡蛋，说是因为他为大家办事很辛苦，送几个鸡蛋给他保养身体。送鸡蛋的人是个资产阶级分子，曾经被群众斗争过。王永幸听了，马上警觉起来。他想：“过去这个人不理我，是因为自己是个穷当兵的，对他没有什么用处；现在他送来鸡蛋，是因为自己当了干部，可以把自己拉过去为他服务。”想到这里，他气愤地对家里人说：“这鸡蛋有毒，咱们不能吃，吃了就会上当。”立即打发孩子将原物退回。
    党总支发现，甜言蜜语、阿谀逢迎，是地主、资产阶级腐蚀党员、干部的另一个重要手段。有一次，一个资产阶级分子极力称赞王永幸“年轻有为”，说什么
  “有志不在年高，无志空长百岁”。王永幸想：毛主席的话真灵验，资产阶级果然来捧场了。他对那个资产阶级分子说：“我是人民的勤务员，不是旧社会的官老爷，用不着你这样奉承。”
    党总支还发现，地主、富农同贫下中农拜干亲、攀亲戚，利用宗法关系模糊阶级界限，是阶级敌人腐蚀党员、干部和贫下中农，达到和平演变的又一个重要手段。圈子村民兵连长、贫农社员王连升的奶奶死了，他的一个出了五服的富农姑姑，忽然跑来烧纸、哭坟，显得那样亲近。大陈家村的一个老地主死了，有个别干部和贫农以亲属关系去帮助出殡，为他吊孝。党总支抓住这些事，在全大队展开了讨论，并组织大家学习了《中国社会各阶级的分析》，使大家进一步认识到：天下的贫下中农都是我们的亲弟兄；天下的地主富农，都是我们的敌人，不管他是死还是活，都要当阶级敌人对待，同他们划清界限，否则就会上当。
    通过这些事件，党总支进一步认识到，旧社会遗留下来的旧风俗、旧习惯，也是为阶级敌人服务的。阶级敌人利用这些来腐蚀干部和群众，使他们丧失斗志，走上蜕化变质的道路。因此，党总支大力宣传移风易俗，提倡新的结婚仪式、新的丧葬仪式，除地富反坏分子外，一般社员死了，都提倡举行追悼会。
      同资产阶级争夺青年一代
    下丁家党总支十分重视对青年一代进行培养和教育。近几年来，党总支在青年中开展了大学毛主席著作的活动，号召他们学习雷锋、王杰、麦贤得。党团支部经常组织一些苦大仇深的老贫农给青年人讲家史、村史，组织青年人访贫问苦，使他们永远不忘旧社会的苦，更加珍惜今天的幸福，永远不忘本、不变质。
    党总支采取了很多措施，保证使老一辈艰苦创业的革命精神能够永远传下去。在进行农田水利基本建设中，他们有计划地在整过的梯田旁边留下保留原貌的“历史地”；在一块地边上保留了互助组时期打成的
  “历史井”；在一块削高填洼整成平坦的梯田里，保留了一棵“井中树”。这棵树在整地以后，树干已经落到地表以下，上面只露树冠，为了保护它，人们围绕树干砌了一眼井，所以成了井中树。他们把这些东西当做活教材，用来教育后代，使青年们永远不忘老一辈艰苦创业的革命精神。
    去年抗旱种麦，用水库水自流灌溉和抽水机提水，已经胜利完成了播种任务。可是，党总支考虑到，有一部分青年过惯了舒服日子，怕他们忘记了艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，因此，决定各个生产队再增种几亩小麦。一不要开闸门，二不要动机器，专要青年们担水抗旱播种。种完以后，又组织青年们进行了讨论，使青年们深切地体会到：要想接好革命的班，必须像老一辈的人那样，有不怕艰苦困难的过硬思想，永远听党的话，听毛主席的话，站稳无产阶级的立场，树立完全彻底为人民服务的共产主义世界观。
    由于党总支的辛勤培植，一大批无产阶级革命事业接班人，已经在下丁家造就出来。在全大队，生产队长以上的青年干部已有二十多名。他们大公无私，立场坚定，不怕困难，很受群众拥护。四百三十多名青年中，有一百二十多名是“五好”社员。最近，经上级党委批准，党总支已接受一批优秀青年加入中国共产党。
                ×　×　×
    经过长期阶级斗争的实践，下丁家党总支深刻地体会到：阶级斗争无所不在。在后进单位有，在先进单位也有；在困难的时候有，在顺利的时候也有；在地富反坏分子多的地方有，在地富反坏分子少、甚至没有的地方也有。因此，必须念念不忘阶级斗争。在困难的时候，在我们的工作出现某些缺点或者遭受某些挫折的时候，阶级敌人往往采取直接进攻的手段；在我们的工作取得胜利的时候，他们往往采取极为隐蔽、曲折的手段。因此，对付阶级敌人必须既要勇敢，又要机智。
    下丁家大队党总支认为：只要牢记毛主席的教导，阶级斗争不但不可怕，反而是社会主义建设的动力。在阶级斗争中，每取得一次胜利，人的思想觉悟就提高一步，社会主义建设就向前推进一步。
