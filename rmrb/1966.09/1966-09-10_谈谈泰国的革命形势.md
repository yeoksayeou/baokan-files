A spark can start a prairie fire. The armed struggle of the Thai people against American imperialism and the Thai reactionaries is developing rapidly and achieving continuous victories. In April and May of this year, the armed people of Sakhon Nakhon Province in northeastern Thailand defeated the "encirclement and suppression" by the American-Thai reactionaries, annihilating more than 160 enemies. In August, in southern Thailand, the people's armed forces annihilated a border patrol team of the Thai and "Malaysian" reactionaries. Now, a large area in northeastern Thailand and the entire southern region have become the domain of the people's armed activities.

The Thai people's struggle against the American-Thai reactionaries began in 1961. The first to rise up were the people of northeastern and southern Thailand, who were the most oppressed. On January 1, 1965, the patriotic forces of Thailand established the Patriotic Front of Thailand, calling on the patriotic people of Thailand to unite and fight to expel American imperialism, overthrow the reactionary government, and achieve complete independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and prosperity for Thailand. Under the leadership of the Patriotic Front of Thailand, the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle of the Thai people has surged even higher. The flames of revolutionary armed struggle have grown from small to large.

From the second half of 1965 to the present, in northeastern Thailand, the people's armed forces fought 24 battles in the second half of last year and 43 battles in the first half of this year. In southern Thailand, the people's armed forces fought 5 battles in the second half of last year and 51 battles in the first seven months of this year. The number of battles fought by the Thai people's armed forces is increasing, and their victories are growing.

Chairman Mao once used the phrase "a spark can start a prairie fire" to describe the development of revolutionary forces. Chairman Mao said, "This means that although there is only a small force now, it will develop very quickly." The development of the armed struggle of the Thai people is completely in line with the law of class struggle pointed out by Chairman Mao.

The more oppressive, the greater the resistance. Thailand has a population of 30 million, bordering Laos, Cambodia, Burma, and Malaya, and is not far from our country. In order to invade Vietnam and Southeast Asia and encircle China, the United States has turned Thailand into its base of aggression. The number of American troops stationed in Thailand has increased to more than 25,000. More than 40 land, sea, and air military bases have been built, and many strategic roads have been constructed. More than half of the American planes bombing Vietnam and Laos fly from Thailand. The Thai reactionaries, acting as running dogs for the Americans, are frantically expanding the military and have recently sent a batch of troops to South Vietnam to be cannon fodder for American imperialism.

The Thai people are subjected to double oppression by the American-Thai reactionaries, and their lives are extremely difficult. Sixty percent of the peasants have no land, and eighty-five percent are in debt, with interest rates as high as 100 to 300 percent. The Americans have seized more than a million acres of farmers' land to build bases, and the Thai reactionaries are ruthlessly exploiting the people's blood and sweat. The Thai people can no longer live, so they rise up to resist and engage in a life-and-death struggle with the American-Thai reactionaries.

The American-Thai reactionaries are very afraid of the Thai people's resistance. The United States has given the Thai reactionaries a lot of money and weapons and trained reactionary troops. They "encircle and suppress" the people's armed forces, committing atrocities everywhere, and brutally oppressing the people. They also imitate the American "strategic hamlets" in South Vietnam and have set up many so-called "self-reliant villages," locking up farmers. They vainly hope to use these methods to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Thai people.

However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "The more the reactionaries oppress the revolutionary people, the more they will, in the end, promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." The brutal suppression by the American-Thai reactionaries adds fuel to the fire of the armed struggle of the Thai people, driving more people to join the people's armed forces and fight against the reactionaries. American imperialism is now very afraid that Thailand will become a second South Vietnam, becoming another grave for the burial of the American paper tiger. However, no matter how desperately the American-Thai reactionaries struggle, the Thai people will definitely achieve the great victory of liberating Thailand.

### 谈谈泰国的革命形势

    谈谈泰国的革命形势
    星星之火　可以燎原
    泰国人民反对美帝国主义和泰国反动派的武装斗争，发展得很快，不断得到胜利。今年四、五月里，泰国东北部沙空那空府人民武装，打垮了美泰反动派的“围剿”，消灭敌人一百六十多人。八月里，在泰国南部，人民武装又消灭了一支泰国和“马来西亚”反动派的“边境混合巡逻队”。现在，泰国东北部的一大片地方和整个南部，已经成了人民武装活动的天下。
    泰国人民反对美泰反动派的斗争，是从一九六一年开始的。最先起来斗争的是受压迫最深的泰国东北部和南部的人民。一九六五年一月一日，泰国爱国力量成立了泰国爱国阵线，号召泰国的爱国人民，团结一致，为赶走美帝国主义，推翻反动政府，彻底实现泰国的独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣而斗争。在泰国爱国阵线的领导下，泰国人民的反帝爱国斗争更加高涨。革命武装斗争的烈火，从小到大地烧了起来。
    从一九六五年下半年到现在，在泰国东北部，人民武装去年下半年打仗二十四次，今年上半年打仗四十三次。在泰国南部，人民武装去年下半年打仗五次，今年头七个月打仗五十一次。泰国人民武装作战的次数越来越多，胜利越来越大。
    毛主席曾经用“星星之火，可以燎原”这句话，来形容革命力量的发展。毛主席说，“这就是说，现在虽只有一点小小的力量，但是它的发展会是很快的。”泰国人民的武装斗争的发展，是完全符合毛主席指出的这条阶级斗争的规律的。
    压迫越凶　反抗越大
    泰国有三千万人口，同老挝、柬埔寨、缅甸、马来亚交界，离我国也很近。美帝为了侵略越南和东南亚，包围中国，把泰国变成了它的侵略基地。美国在泰国驻军已增至两万五千多人。修建的陆、海、空军基地已有四十多个。还修了许多战略公路。美国轰炸越南和老挝的飞机，一大半是从泰国飞去的。泰国反动派替美国当走狗，拚命扩军，最近还派了一批军队到南越去，给美帝国主义当炮灰。
    泰国人民受到美泰反动派的双重压迫，生活非常痛苦。农民百分之六十没有土地，百分之八十五欠债，利息高到百分之一百到三百。美国修基地霸占了农民一百多万亩土地，泰国反动派还拚命搜括人民的血汗。泰国人民活不下去了，就起来反抗，同美泰反动派进行你死我活的斗争。
    美泰反动派对于泰国人民的反抗，非常害怕。美国给了泰国反动派许多钱和武器，训练反动部队。他们“围剿”人民武装，到处奸淫烧杀，残酷迫害人民。他们还学美国在南越搞“战略村”的办法，设立了许多所谓“自立村”，把农民关起来。他们妄想用这些办法来扑灭泰国人民的革命烈火。
    但是，正像毛主席所指出的，反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。美泰反动派的残暴镇压给泰国人民的武装斗争火上加油，把更多的人“逼上梁山”，参加人民武装，同反动派斗争。美帝国主义现在非常害怕泰国变成第二个南越，成为埋葬美国纸老虎的又一座坟墓。但是，不管美泰反动派怎样疯狂挣扎，泰国人民一定会取得解放泰国的伟大胜利。
