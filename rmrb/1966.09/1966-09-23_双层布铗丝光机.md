The fabric sizing machines used in the sizing process of dyeing factories worldwide are typically single-layer, with one end for feeding and the other for output.

The Shanghai Li Xin Third Dyeing and Finishing Factory and other enterprises have innovatively developed a double-layer fabric sizing machine. Without adding new equipment or expanding the factory, they have increased production by 80%. This is a new technology for the world. This machine is now being mass-produced.
