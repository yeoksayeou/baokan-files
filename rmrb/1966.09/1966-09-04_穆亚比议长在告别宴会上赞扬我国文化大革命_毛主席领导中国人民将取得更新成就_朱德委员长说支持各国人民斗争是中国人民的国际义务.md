The Speaker of the National Assembly of Congo (Brazzaville), Muabi Andre George, said at a farewell banquet he held tonight, "Our stay in Beijing has allowed us to see how Chairman Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China are so good at leading China's great revolutionary cause. We are convinced that under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people will achieve even greater successes."

The Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhu De, and his wife Kang Keqing, Vice Chairmen Kang Sheng, Guo Moruo, Yang Mingxuan, Liu Ningyi, Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Xie Fuzhi, were invited to the farewell banquet hosted by Speaker Muabi and his wife.

Speaker Muabi and Chairman Zhu both spoke at the banquet, expressing their mutual wishes for the continued development of friendship between the peoples of Congo (Brazzaville) and China.

In his speech, Speaker Muabi said, "The work being done in China and the achievements already made, especially China's efforts under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow and smash those who take the capitalist road, reactionaries, the bourgeoisie, and all other exploiting classes for the benefit of the masses, and to win the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have greatly interested us."

Speaker Muabi said, "We believe that in the process of eliminating old and new colonialism and imperialism, the Chinese people will always stand by our side. We will continue to support the Chinese people's stance against U.S. aggression in Vietnam, which is our contribution to the anti-imperialist struggle of the progressive peoples of Asia, Africa, and other countries in the world. We believe that Vietnam will ultimately win because its struggle is a just struggle."

In his speech, Chairman Zhu expressed heartfelt thanks to Speaker Muabi for the support and encouragement given to the Chinese people during his visit to Beijing. Chairman Zhu reaffirmed that the 700 million Chinese people will forever stand with the people of Congo (Brazzaville), the peoples of Asia and Africa, and the revolutionary peoples of the world, supporting each other and advancing together. He said, "The anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of the world is an indivisible whole of mutual response and support. The Chinese people regard supporting the just anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of various countries as their international duty."

When talking about the excellent situation of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples, Chairman Zhu pointed out, "Imperialism and its running dogs will not leave or be overthrown without being driven out or defeated. As long as the Asian and African peoples and the peoples of the world unite, build the broadest international anti-American united front, dare to struggle, and dare to win, they will definitely be able to thoroughly defeat American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, and achieve final victory."

Chairman Zhu said, "Chairman Mao Zedong has clearly stated: 'The Chinese people regard the victory of the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victory and give enthusiastic support to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles.' Our firm stance on this will never waver in any circumstances. The slanders, attacks, and attempts to sow discord by imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are in vain."

Those invited to the banquet also included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qi Pengfei, some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and leaders from various government departments, the People's Liberation Army, and people's organizations. Jean Daniel Bakula, Chargé d'Affaires of the Congolese (Brazzaville) Embassy in China, and some ambassadors from African countries to China, also attended the banquet.

    毛主席领导中国人民将取得更新成就
    朱德委员长说支持各国人民斗争是中国人民的国际义务
    新华社三日讯　刚果（布）国民议会议长穆亚比·安德烈·乔治今晚在他举行的告别宴会上说，“我们在北京的逗留，已经使我们能够看到毛泽东主席和中国共产党是多么善于领导中国的伟大的革命事业。我们确信，中国人民在英明的毛泽东思想指引下，将取得更新的成就。”
    人大常委会委员长朱德和夫人康克清，副委员长康生、郭沫若、杨明轩、刘宁一，国务院副总理陈毅、谢富治，应邀出席了穆亚比议长和夫人举行的告别宴会。
    穆亚比议长和朱德委员长先后在宴会上讲话。他们共祝刚果（布）和中国人民的友谊不断发展。
    穆亚比议长在讲话中说，中国正在进行的工作和已经取得的成就，特别是中国在毛泽东思想的指导下，为了人民群众的利益，打倒和粉碎走资本主义道路的人、反动派、资产阶级和其他一切剥削阶级，争取无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，使我们感到兴趣。
    穆亚比议长说，我们相信，在消除新老殖民主义以及帝国主义的过程中，中国人民将永远站在我们一边。我们将不断地支持中国人民对美国侵略越南所持的立场，这就是我们对亚洲、非洲及世界其它国家进步人民的反帝斗争的贡献。我们相信，越南将取得最后胜利，因为越南的斗争是正义的斗争。
    朱德委员长在讲话中，对穆亚比议长在访问北京期间给予中国人民的支持和鼓励，表示衷心的感谢。朱德委员长重申，七亿中国人民将永远和刚果（布）人民、亚非人民以及全世界革命人民一道，相互支持，并肩前进。他说，全世界人民的反帝斗争是互相呼应、互相支援的一个不可分割的整体。中国人民把支援各国人民的反帝正义斗争，看作是自己应尽的国际义务。
    朱德委员长谈到亚非人民反帝斗争的大好形势时指出，帝国主义和它的走狗是不赶不走，不打不倒的。只要亚非人民和全世界人民团结起来，建立最广泛的国际反美统一战线，敢于斗争、敢于胜利，就一定能够彻底打败美帝国主义和各国反动派，赢得最后的胜利。
    朱德委员长说，毛泽东主席明确宣布过：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”我们的这一坚定立场，在任何情况下，都是不可动摇的。帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的诬蔑攻击、挑拨离间，都是枉费心机。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有外交部副部长姬鹏飞，人大常委会部分委员，以及政府其他各部门、人民解放军和人民团体的负责人。刚果（布）驻中国大使馆临时代办让·丹尼尔·巴库拉，一些非洲国家驻中国的使节，也出席了宴会。
