	Chairman Mao's works are a beacon,
	The more you study, the more strength you gain,
	Dare to think, dare to act, dare to make revolution,
	Swear to be a revolutionary screw.

	Chairman Mao's works are a beacon,
	The more you study, the firmer your stance,
	Clear mind, sharp eyes, and a strong backbone,
	Stand firm in the face of storms and waves.

	Chairman Mao's works are a beacon,
	The more you study, the clearer the path,
	Forever follow the Party to make revolution,
	Swear to be the red successors.
