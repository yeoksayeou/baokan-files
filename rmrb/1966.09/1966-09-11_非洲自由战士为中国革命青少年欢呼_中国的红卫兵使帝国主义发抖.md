African freedom fighters have enthusiastically praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and hailed the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards, composed of Chinese youth, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have lauded them as "an unprecedented revolutionary shock brigade in the history of the progressive world" and "the truly revolutionary young generation that defends Mao Zedong Thought."

A leader of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) pointed out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat is uprooting the foundations of imperialism and revisionism. Therefore, revisionist elements are now coming out to openly attack the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

The Acting Chairman of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, Leballo, recently told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent in Dar es Salaam: "The appearance of the revolutionary youth Red Guards of the People's Republic of China has made the imperialists tremble. The Chinese Red Guards are advancing; they are the revolutionary vanguard against imperialism."

The Chief Representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania in Dar es Salaam, David Sibeko, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent that he, on behalf of the fighting people of Azania, enthusiastically cheered for the Chinese Red Guards. He said: "The Red Guards are the truly revolutionary young generation that defends Mao Zedong Thought."

The Acting Representative of the South West Africa People's Organization in Dar es Salaam, Kanju, praised the Red Guards as "an unprecedented revolutionary shock brigade in the history of the progressive world."

He said: "All revolutionary peoples of the world salute you, the young and brave Red Guards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; your resolute determination to eradicate reactionary culture is an inspiration to all peoples of the world who are fighting."

He said that these fearless, young, and brave warriors, under the brilliant and correct guidance of the thoughts of Chairman Mao, dare to firmly fight against all enemies of the people—the U.S. imperialists, modern revisionists, and all their lackeys around the world. "Therefore, the actions of the Red Guards not only receive the support of the Chinese people but also the support of all progressive peoples of the world."
