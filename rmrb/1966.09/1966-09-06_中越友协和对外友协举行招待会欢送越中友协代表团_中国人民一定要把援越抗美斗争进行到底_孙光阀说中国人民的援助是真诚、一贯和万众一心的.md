The China-Vietnam Friendship Association and the China International Friendship Association hosted a banquet to see off the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation. The Chinese people must see the struggle to aid Vietnam in resisting American aggression through to the end. Sun Guanguo said that the aid from the Chinese people is sincere, consistent, and united.

According to Xinhua News Agency, at tonight's banquet to see off the Vietnam-China Friendship Association delegation, comrades from both China and Vietnam delivered passionate speeches, recited poems, and sang songs, jointly praising the great fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam.

The delegation, led by Sun Guanguo and deputy leader Fan Hong, concluded their visit to the Beijing area and will travel to other parts of China tomorrow for further visits and tours.

Yang Xiufeng, president of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association, said at tonight's banquet that the friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam can withstand any storm. The 700 million Chinese people will definitely see the struggle to aid Vietnam in resisting American aggression through to the end.

He said, "Chairman Mao pointed out: 'U.S. imperialism is all bark and no bite. We must keep a clear head, which includes not believing the sweet talk of imperialism and not fearing imperialist threats.' Under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese people will definitely defeat the American aggressors and achieve final victory."

Sun Guanguo, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the fighting unity between the front lines and rear areas of China and Vietnam. He said, "The support from the Chinese people to the Vietnamese people is sincere, consistent, and united. We are deeply moved."

Sun Guanguo spoke about the achievements China has made in various fields and the ongoing Cultural Revolution. He said, "The achievements of the Chinese people have greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression for national salvation."

At the meeting, Sun Guanguo, the delegation leader, recited with great emotion a poem he wrote during his visit to China, titled "In Commemoration of the 21st Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." Deputy leader Fan Hong followed with a poem, which included the lines: "Vietnam and China are like lips and teeth, under the red banner of Marxism-Leninism, comrade friendship will never change!" A female member of the delegation, a labor model from Haiphong City, Cao Thi Lan, said she had never written a poem before. After visiting the Shashiya Brigade of the Shaziya Village in Xuanhua County, Hebei Province, she was deeply moved by the revolutionary spirit of the local people moving mountains and wrote a poem to present to the Iron Girls Brigade of Shashiya. Her poem reads: "This beautiful scenery is created by labor, the waves of grain and trees are higher than the mountains, flowers are fragrant and fruits are sweet, the people are prosperous, and Shashiya will forever remember Comrade Mao!"

Artists from the capital also sang songs in both Chinese and Vietnamese, including "Liberate the South," "Praise Chairman Ho Chi Minh," "The Ship Sails on the Ocean," and "I Love to Read Chairman Mao's Books."

At the banquet, Chu Tunan, president of the China International Friendship Association, proposed a toast, asking the delegation to convey the greetings and revolutionary respect of the Chinese people to the brotherly Vietnamese people.

Tonight's banquet was hosted by the China-Vietnam Friendship Association and the China International Friendship Association. Some Red Guards from the capital and relevant officials attended the banquet. Guests invited to the banquet included Nguyen Quang Huy, Counselor of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, and Nguyen Minh Phuong, Acting Head of the Vietnam South National Liberation Front's Permanent Delegation to China.

    他说，毛主席指出：“美帝国主义是外强中干的。我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”越南人民在胡志明主席和越南劳动党的领导下，一定能够打败美国侵略者，取得最后的胜利。

    首都文艺工作者也在会上用中越两国话，唱了《解放南方》、《歌颂胡志明主席》、《大海航行靠舵手》、《毛主席的书我最爱读》等中越两国的歌曲。
