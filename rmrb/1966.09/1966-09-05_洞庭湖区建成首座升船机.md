The transportation department of Hunan Province has recently completed the first ship lift in the Dongting Lake area by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The ship lift is now in normal operation.

The ship lift is installed near Yiyang City. Previously, when waterborne cargo passed through this area, it had to be manually transferred, which not only caused delays in transit but also resulted in significant damage to the goods during the transfer process. Now, with the ship lift in operation, transit is timely, transportation costs are lower, and damage to goods is minimized. This has saved a large amount of labor for rural areas, and farmers and boatmen are very pleased.

    洞庭湖区建成首座升船机
    据新华社长沙四日电　湖南省交通部门职工活学活用毛主席著作，最近在洞庭湖区建成了第一座升船机，并且已正常运转过船。
    这座升船机安装在益阳市附近。过去，水上运输的物资经过这里时，都要用人工搬运，不仅中转不及时，而且翻堤过驳时货物损伤大。现在用升船机过船，转运及时，运费低，货物损坏少，为农村节省了大批劳力，农民、船民很欢迎。
