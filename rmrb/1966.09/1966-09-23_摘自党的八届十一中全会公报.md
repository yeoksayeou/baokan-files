We must have the great ambition and resolve of the proletariat. We must dare to tread paths where no one has gone before, and dare to scale peaks that no one has reached before. We must build a strong socialist China that accounts for one-fourth of the world's population, making it an ironclad bastion of the proletariat that will never change color.

    我们一定要有无产阶级的雄心壮志，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。我们一定要把占世界人口四分之一的社会主义中国建设好，使它成为无产阶级的铁打的江山，永不变色。
