The higher Party committee of Drilling Team 32111 recently made a decision to posthumously award Zhang Yongqing, the deputy driller of the heroic 32111 Drilling Team and a Communist Party member, who sacrificed his life in the battle to extinguish a gas well fire, with the title of Model Communist Party Member.

The decision states that Zhang Yongqing, in order to lead the fire out of the well site, save the gas well, and protect his comrades, fearlessly and bravely rushed into the fire, sacrificing his life for the rescue of the gas well and the revolutionary cause. This fully demonstrates a Communist Party member's unlimited loyalty to the Party and the noble quality of sacrificing one's life for the revolutionary cause.

The decision also, based on the requests of the martyrs before their deaths, posthumously recognizes Wang Ping, the deputy driller of the 32111 Drilling Team and a member of the Communist Youth League, Luo Huatai, a driller, and Wu Zhongqi, an assistant diesel engine driver, who all sacrificed their lives in the same battle as Zhang Yongqing, as formal members of the Communist Party of China. The higher Youth League committee, based on the requests of the martyrs before their deaths, posthumously recognizes Wang Zuming, a driller, and Deng Muquan, an assistant driver, as members of the Communist Youth League of China.
