Under the impetus of the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the national textile industry continues to advance rapidly, efficiently, and economically.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated September 20th, the 1.5 million textile workers in China, with the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a powerful driving force, have pushed the national textile industry production to a new high.

Since this year, the situation on the textile industry front has been excellent, presenting a revolutionary scene full of vitality. The broad masses of textile workers, with deep feelings of boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, taking the great Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all work. They have set their minds on spinning yarns and weaving cloth for the revolution, and on better solving the people's clothing problem. Their class consciousness has rapidly increased, their revolutionary spirit has been greatly invigorated, their enthusiasm has doubled, and they have ensured victory in both revolution and production.

In the first eight months of this year, the textile industry has maintained a continuous leap-forward situation. Major products such as cotton, wool, silk, hemp, chemical fibers, and textile machinery have all overfulfilled the state plan, with significant increases compared to the same period last year. Among these, cotton yarn production has increased by 18%, higher than any other year since the founding of New China. China's production capacity per thousand spindles per hour continues to maintain an advanced world level. Product quality has been steadily improved, and costs have been reduced. The cost of man-made wool in major chemical fiber factories nationwide has been reduced by one-fifth compared to last year, reaching the price level of cotton. At the same time, textile workers have created many new technologies, processes, equipment, and materials at an advanced world level, creating good conditions for the comprehensive leap forward of China's textile industry in the future. The workers of the Wuxi Silk and Dyeing Factory in Jiangsu Province have successfully developed an automatic screen printing machine for silk and other matching equipment, freeing China's silk printing industry from cumbersome manual operations.

    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命推动下
    全国纺织工业多快好省继续跃进
    据新华社二十日讯  我国一百五十万纺织工人以史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命作为强大动力，把全国纺织工业生产推向了一个新高潮。
    今年以来，纺织工业战线的形势大好，呈现了一片热气腾腾的革命景象。广大纺织工人怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深厚感情，活学活用毛主席著作，以伟大的毛泽东思想为一切工作的指导方针，立下为革命纺纱织布，为人民更好地解决穿衣问题的雄心壮志，阶级觉悟迅速提高，革命精神大振，干劲倍增，保证了革命和生产双胜利。
    今年头八个月纺织工业生产一直是持续跃进的局面。棉、毛、丝、麻、化学纤维、纺织机械等主要产品，都超额完成了国家计划，比去年同期有了较大幅度的增长。其中，棉纱产量增长百分之十八，比新中国建立以来任何一年的同期产量都高。我国每千锭每小时的生产能力，继续保持着世界先进水平。产品质量稳定提高，成本下降。全国主要化学纤维厂人造毛的成本，比去年降低五分之一，达到了棉花的价格水平。在这同时，纺织职工还创造出许多具有世界先进水平的新技术、新工艺、新设备和新材料，为我国纺织工业今后全面跃进创造了良好条件。江苏省无锡丝绸印染厂职工创制成功丝绸自动筛网印花机和其他配套设备，使我国丝绸印花工业摆脱了笨重的手工操作。（附图片）
