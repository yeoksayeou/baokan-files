African freedom fighters study Chairman Mao's works in the midst of battle.

They cross through the enemy's numerous blockades, risking their lives to bring Chairman Mao's works into the deep forests and mountains. When they encounter difficulties in their struggles, they consult Chairman Mao's works to find the correct answers.

A young freedom fighter from Zimbabwe, upon receiving a copy of "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" that he had long awaited, eagerly opened the book, gazed affectionately at Chairman Mao's portrait, and called out, "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!" He then shouted in Chinese, which he had learned during his visit to China, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Why do the African people hold such deep affection for Chairman Mao's works? A leader of African freedom fighters said, "The greatest support for our liberation struggle is Mao Zedong Thought. Only Mao Zedong Thought can guide us to victory." A leader of armed struggles in southern Africa said, Mao Zedong's works are a revolutionary guide that every revolutionary must read. A young freedom fighter from Zimbabwe said, Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our time. "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of China and the Chinese revolution, but also the great leader of all progressive forces and the world revolution."

Dar es Salaam is one of the centers of the African liberation movement. The headquarters of the African Liberation Committee of the Organization of African Unity is located here, and many African freedom fighters gather here. Many offices of African liberation movements are also set up here. The African freedom fighters here have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao's works. They regard Mao Zedong Thought as food, weapons, and steering wheel, seeing it as the greatest guarantee for their struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and for achieving national liberation. When the freedom fighters leave here and return to the front lines, they, despite the long journey and the enemy's numerous blockades, risk their lives to carefully bring large quantities of Chairman Mao's works into the forests, bushes, and mountains, and into the hands of their comrades-in-arms on the front lines of armed struggle. When the freedom fighters encounter difficulties and cannot find solutions, they consult Chairman Mao's works to find the correct answers. Once, a group of southern African freedom fighters, while planning their armed struggle against imperialism and its puppets, had a heated discussion on what should be prioritized in combat. Someone loudly read a passage from Chairman Mao's "On Protracted War": "In war, the primary objective is to annihilate the enemy, and the secondary objective is to preserve oneself, because only by annihilating a large number of the enemy can one effectively preserve oneself." Chairman Mao's words opened their minds and made them see clearly. They said, Chairman Mao's words are correct. Let us, under the guidance of the great teacher Chairman Mao Zedong's thought, unify our thoughts and actions. Some of them also said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist. We must act according to Chairman Mao's thoughts. We cannot follow the revisionist line of the Soviet Union. If we follow their line, we will surely make big mistakes."

    毛泽东思想是粮食、武器、方向盘
    非洲自由战士在战斗中学习毛主席著作
    他们越过敌人重重封锁，冒着生命危险，把毛主席著作带到密林深山，在斗争中遇到疑难问题，就向毛主席著作请教，从中寻找正确的答案。
    一位津巴布韦的青年自由战士在得到一本他期待已久的《毛泽东军事文选》之后，兴奋地打开书皮，深情地凝视着毛主席的像片，亲切地唤道：“毛主席，毛主席！”并且用他曾经在中国访问时学会的中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    为什么非洲人民对毛主席著作怀有那么深厚的感情呢？一位非洲自由战士的领导人说得好：“我们的解放斗争所得到的最大的支持是毛泽东思想。只有毛泽东思想才能引导我们走向胜利。”一位非洲南部武装斗争的领导人说：毛主席的著作是每个革命者必读的革命指南。一位来自津巴布韦的青年自由战士说，毛泽东是当代的列宁。“毛主席不仅是中国和中国革命的伟大领袖，而且也是一切进步力量和世界革命的伟大领袖”。
    达累斯萨拉姆是非洲解放运动的中心之一。非洲统一组织的非洲解放委员会总部设在这里，非洲许多自由战士聚集在这里，许多非洲解放运动的办事处也设在这里。在这里的非洲的自由战士无限热爱毛主席的著作，他们把毛泽东思想看作是粮食、武器、方向盘，看作是他们反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和争取民族解放斗争取得胜利的最大保证。当自由战士离开这里，返回前线时，他们不顾长途跋涉，越过敌人的重重封锁，冒着生命危险，把大批毛主席著作小心翼翼地带到森林里、灌木丛中和山上，带到正在武装斗争最前线的亲密战友的手中。当自由战士们遇到疑难问题，得不到解决的时候，他们就请教毛主席著作，从中寻找正确的答案。有一次，一群南部非洲的自由战士在计划他们同帝国主义及其傀儡进行武装斗争的问题时，对在作战中应首先考虑什么问题展开了争论，有人高声朗读了毛主席《论持久战》中的一段话：“战争目的中，消灭敌人是主要的，保存自己是第二位的，因为只有大量地消灭敌人，才能有效地保存自己。”毛主席的话使他们开了心窍，使他们心明眼亮，他们说：毛主席的话很对。让我们在伟大的导师毛泽东主席的思想指导下统一思想和行动。他们当中还有人说：“毛主席是最伟大的马列主义者。我们必须照毛主席的思想办事。我们不能追随苏联修正主义路线。如果我们追随他们的路线，我们准会犯大错误。”（据新华社）
