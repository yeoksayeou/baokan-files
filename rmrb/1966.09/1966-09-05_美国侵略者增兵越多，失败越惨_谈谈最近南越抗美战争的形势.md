The More Troops the U.S. Invaders Send, the More Disastrous Their Defeat

Talking About the Recent Situation in the Anti-U.S. War in South Vietnam

The U.S. Empire Suffers Defeat After Defeat but Continues to Cause Trouble

Recently, the U.S. imperialists have been sending batch after batch of cannon fodder to the South Vietnamese battlefield. In August alone, another 6,800 troops arrived in South Vietnam. At the end of January this year, the total number of U.S. invading troops was nearly 200,000, and now it has exceeded 300,000. The U.S. invading bandits are like mad dogs, desperately rushing into a dead end.

From last November to this March, the U.S. invaders launched a "dry season offensive." They boasted that they would definitely achieve something. They launched dozens of major "sweeps." U.S. troops and puppet forces, totaling more than a hundred battalions, stormed into the liberated areas, literally delivering themselves to the South Vietnamese people's armed forces to be beaten up. In five months, the South Vietnamese people's armed forces annihilated more than 43,000 U.S. troops and mercenaries, destroying 1,400 aircraft and 1,300 military vehicles, turning them into scrap metal. After March, it was the rainy season in South Vietnam, and the U.S. invaders dared not come out in large numbers, but they still got beaten. Whether it was aircraft parked on the ground or 10,000-ton cargo ships anchored in the river, they all got bombed. Once, the South Vietnamese liberation army annihilated a U.S. tank and armored car battalion in one go.

Chairman Mao said: "Cause trouble, fail; cause more trouble, fail more; keep causing trouble until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." The U.S. imperialists suffered defeat after defeat in South Vietnam and still increased their troops, which is the reason.

The Vietnamese People's War Demonstrates Infinite Power

The anti-U.S. war in South Vietnam is a people's war. All the people of South Vietnam have been mobilized, regardless of gender or age, everyone is fighting the U.S. aggressors. During the dry season battles, thousands of "U.S. annihilators" emerged. Thirteen-year-old hero Doan Van Lien annihilated fourteen U.S. aggressors. Fifty-seven-year-old hero Vu Kiet used a few rifle bullets to kill four U.S. soldiers and shoot down a helicopter. The people of South Vietnam use guns if they have them, use knives if they have them, and if they have neither, use bamboo spears and bows and arrows to fight the U.S. aggressors.

U.S. Marine Corps Commander Greene recently said: The U.S. wants to "drive the South Vietnamese armed forces out of the villages." This is truly a daytime dream. As soon as the U.S. dandies enter the mountains and dense forests of South Vietnam, their forces are scattered, thinly spread, and they can neither hear nor see anything, only to be beaten up. The vast rural areas of South Vietnam are where the people's armed forces can show their prowess and where the U.S. invaders are buried. In the face of such a people's war, what use are the 300,000 troops that the U.S. imperialists have sent?

Chairman Mao said, "What is the real iron wall? It is the people, the tens of millions of people who genuinely support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable."

The Paper Tiger Is Exposed, the Defeat Is Irreversible

The U.S. has already sent 300,000 troops to South Vietnam, but it is still not enough. U.S. newspapers say that by the end of this year, the number of U.S. invading troops will increase to 450,000, and some say it will increase to 750,000.

The people's war in South Vietnam is a vast ocean of full-scale mobilization. No matter how many troops the U.S. invading forces have, whether it is 300,000, 450,000, or 750,000, or even 1 million, once they fall into this vast ocean, they will never be able to get out.

The more U.S. troops come, the more bases they occupy, and the more "sweeps" they conduct, the more opportunities the South Vietnamese liberation army has to fight the U.S. aggressors. The past facts are like this. From 1961 to June 1965, the number of U.S. invaders in South Vietnam increased from a few thousand to 60,000. During this period, they were annihilated more than 6,000 times. From July 1965 to June 1966, the number of U.S. invaders increased to more than 200,000. During this period, they were annihilated more than 63,000 times.

During our country's war of liberation, Chairman Mao talked about the Kuomintang reactionaries and said, "The situation is like this: they come to attack, and we annihilate them, and they feel comfortable. Annihilate a little, feel a little comfortable; annihilate a lot, feel a lot comfortable; annihilate completely, feel completely comfortable." On the South Vietnamese battlefield, the more U.S. invading troops come, the more they are annihilated. Annihilate a little, feel a little comfortable. But they have not yet felt completely comfortable, they still want to increase their troops, still want to struggle desperately, until they are completely annihilated and completely comfortable.

### 美国侵略者增兵越多，失败越惨——谈谈最近南越抗美战争的形势

    美国侵略者增兵越多，失败越惨
    ——谈谈最近南越抗美战争的形势
    美帝连战连败　还在继续捣乱
    最近，美帝国主义把一批又一批的炮灰，送到南越战场上去。就在八月份，开到南越的，又有六千八百人。今年一月底，美国侵略军的总数是近二十万人，现在已经超过三十万。美国侵略强盗像一条疯狗，拚命往死胡同里窜。
    从去年十一月到今年三月，美国侵略者发动了一个“旱季攻势”。他们吹牛说一定要干出点名堂来。他们发动了几十次大“扫荡”，美国大兵加伪军，一共出动了一百多个营。这些脓包一闯进解放区，真是自己送上门来，让南越人民武装抓住他们痛打。在五个月中，南越人民武装一共歼灭了四万三千多美军和帮凶军，把一千四百多架飞机和一千三百多辆军车，打成废铜烂铁。三月份以后，在南越是雨季，美国侵略者不敢大模大样地出来了，可是照样挨打。不管是蹲在地上的各种飞机，停在河里的万吨货船，都挨了炸。有一次南越解放军一下子歼灭了美国的一个坦克和装甲车战团。
    毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义在南越连吃败仗，还要增兵，就是这个道理。
    越南人民战争　发挥无穷威力
    南越人民的抗美战争，是人民战争。南越的人民全都动员起来了，不论男女老少，人人都打美国强盗。在旱季战斗中，出现了几千个“歼美勇士”。十三岁的小英雄段文练，歼灭了十四个美国强盗。五十七岁的老勇士武骥，用几发步枪子弹打死了四个美国兵，打落了一架直升飞机。南越人民有枪的用枪，有刀的用刀，没有刀枪，就用竹尖、弓箭对付美国强盗。
    美国海军陆战队司令格林最近说：美国要把南越人民武装都“赶出村庄”。这真是大白天做梦。美国少爷兵一进入南越的山沟沟和密密麻麻的树林，不仅兵力分散，稀稀拉拉，什么也听不见，什么也看不清，只有挨揍的份。南越的广大农村，是人民武装大显身手的地方，是埋葬美国侵略者的坟地。在这样的人民战争面前，美帝国主义拿出三十万兵力，又能顶什么用呢？
    毛主席说，“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。”
    纸老虎被戳穿　败局无法挽回
    美国在南越，已经拿出了三十万兵力，还嫌不够。美国报纸说，到今年年底，美国侵略军要增加到四十五万，有的讲要增加到七十五万。
    南越人民战争是一个全民动员的汪洋大海。美国侵略军不管是三十万、四十五万，还是七十五万，那怕是一百万，一掉进这个汪洋大海，就再也爬不出来了。
    美国兵来得越多，占的据点越多，出来“扫荡”的次数越多，南越解放军打美国强盗的机会也就越多。过去的事实就是这样。从一九六一年到一九六五年六月，在南越的美国侵略者从几千人增加到六万人。在这个时期里，他们被歼灭六千多人。从一九六五年七月到一九六六年六月，美国侵略者增加到二十几万人。在这个时期里，他们被歼灭六万三千多人。
    毛主席在我国解放战争时期，谈到国民党反动派的时候说过，“事情就是这样，他来进攻，我们把他消灭了，他就舒服了。消灭一点，舒服一点；消灭得多，舒服得多；彻底消灭，彻底舒服。”在南越战场上，美国侵略军来得越多，被消灭得就越多。被消灭一点，它就舒服一点。但是，它还没有彻底舒服，它还要增兵，还要拚命挣扎，直到被彻底消灭、彻底舒服为止。
