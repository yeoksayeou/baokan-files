	The broad masses of cadres and community members in Hebei Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have grasped the revolution and promoted production, emphasized politics, and worked hard. Following the summer harvest, they have again achieved an autumn harvest.

	Currently, the early autumn crops such as sorghum, corn, and sorghum in this province are all gradually maturing. The broad masses of community members are joyfully harvesting. From the crop growth and the initial threshing results of the harvested crops, it can be seen that most areas have increased production to varying degrees compared to the bumper harvest year of 1965.

	To ensure the timely harvesting and storage of autumn crops, the various levels of party and government leadership in Hebei Province have dispatched a large number of cadres to the production front lines to participate in and lead the autumn harvest. While harvesting early-maturing crops, community members in various places are strengthening the late-stage management of late-autumn crops, striving for an overall bumper harvest this year.

	Since late January this year, Hebei Province's rural areas have launched a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of cadres and community members have further established the idea of farming for the revolution. This year, the autumn crops in each region have been planted better than any previous year.

	During the sowing period, various places encountered severe droughts. Community members and cadres repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Moving Mountains" and "Abolish Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," criticized the idea of relying on heaven for food, relied on collective strength, and carried out large-scale agricultural water conservancy construction. They tenaciously fought against the drought. Before the rainy season arrived, the entire province's various places completed well construction, spring excavation, canal construction, and the construction of water pumping stations, expanding a total of more than six million mu of irrigated land. They finally overcame the drought and ensured timely sowing and full germination.

	During the growth period of the autumn crops, various pests also occurred. Various levels of leadership, following Chairman Mao's guidance on concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles, timely mobilized the masses to adopt various methods to eliminate various pests. Then, they advanced, strengthened field management, and ensured an autumn bumper harvest.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Xi'an on the 12th, the broad masses of community members in Shaanxi's cotton-producing areas are happily picking new cotton. From the main cotton-producing area of Guanzhong, it can be seen that this year, most of the cotton has good growth, with many early and mid-season cotton bolls, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest.

	The communes and production teams in various main cotton-producing areas in Shaanxi, as early as the cotton field preparation period, according to Chairman Mao's guidance on continuously summarizing experience, timely summarized experience, and clearly recognized that: whether cotton can be well managed depends on people, not on heaven, and whether people can well manage cotton depends on whether they have a red heart for the revolution. Thus, they universally rectified the cotton planting teams and established the system of studying Chairman Mao's works within the teams. Community members, with their minds armed with Mao Zedong Thought, despite encountering drought before cotton sowing and hail and pest disasters during growth, followed Chairman Mao's guidance, dared to struggle and were good at struggling, achieving one victory after another.

	In the current Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of community members in the cotton-producing areas further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, with even higher revolutionary enthusiasm. They vow to achieve a cotton bumper harvest to counterattack the anti-party and anti-socialist black gangs. Currently, many community members are still strengthening the late-stage management of cotton.

    生产靠人，人靠毛泽东思想
    河北战胜灾害秋作物丰收有望  陕西棉花长势好社员喜摘新棉
    据新华社保定十一日电　河北省广大干部社员高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命促生产，突出政治，艰苦奋斗，继今年夏季丰收之后，又夺得了秋季丰收。
    现在，这个省的谷子、玉米、高粱等早秋粮食作物都陆续成熟，广大社员怀着喜悦的心情，正在紧张地收割。从庄稼长势和登场作物初步碾打结果看，绝大部分地区都比丰收的一九六五年有不同程度的增产。
    为了保证秋熟作物适时收割，颗粒归仓，河北省各级党政领导机关已经抽调出大批干部，派到生产第一线，去参加秋收、领导秋收。各地社员在收割早熟作物的同时，对晚秋作物普遍加强后期管理，力争今年全面丰收。
    河北省农村从今年一月下旬起就掀起了学习毛主席著作的高潮，广大干部和社员进一步树立为革命种田的思想。今年各个地区的秋熟作物种得比过去任何一年都好。
    在播种前后，各地都遇到了严重的干旱。社员和干部们反复学习毛主席的《愚公移山》、《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，批判了靠天吃饭的思想，依靠集体力量，大搞农田水利基本建设，顽强地进行了抗旱斗争。在雨季到来之前，全省各地打井、挖泉、修渠和建造扬水站等工程，总共扩大了六百多万亩水浇地，终于战胜了干旱，保证了适时播种和全苗。
    各地秋熟作物生长期间又发生了虫害。各级领导机关遵循毛主席的集中优势兵力打歼灭战的教导，及时发动广大群众，采取各种办法，扑灭了各种虫害。接着，乘胜前进，加强田间管理，保证了秋季丰收。
    据新华社西安十二日电　陕西产棉区广大社员喜摘新棉。从棉花主要产区关中地区看，今年绝大部分棉花长势好，伏前桃和伏桃比较多，呈现一片丰收景象。
    陕西各主产棉区的社、队，早在棉田备耕时，就根据毛主席关于不断总结经验的教导，及时地总结了经验，明确认识到：棉花能不能务好，关键在人不在天，而人能不能务好棉，关键又在有没有一颗为革命务棉的红心。于是普遍整顿了植棉组，在组里建立学习毛主席著作制度。社员们由于用毛泽东思想武装了头脑，尽管棉花播种前遇到了干旱，生长过程中又碰到雹灾虫害，但是，他们遵照毛主席的教导，敢于斗争，善于斗争，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    在当前的文化大革命中，产棉区的广大社员进一步活学活用毛主席著作，革命热情更高，他们誓夺棉花丰收，用来反击反党反社会主义的黑帮。现在许多社员还在不断地加强棉花后期管理。
