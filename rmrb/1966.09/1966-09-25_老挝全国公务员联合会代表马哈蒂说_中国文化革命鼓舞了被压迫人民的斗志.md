	Mahati, a representative of the Lao National Civil Servants Union, recently returned from a visit to China and spoke to a reporter from this agency about his impressions of his visit to China. He enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	He said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being carried out by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in China, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, has great historical significance. It is a great revolution to thoroughly eliminate the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of capitalism and feudalism, and to promote the advancement of socialism. It is a great revolution to destroy bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology. The Cultural Revolution in China is not only for the revolution of the Chinese people but also for the revolution of the people of the world."

	He said that the Cultural Revolution in China greatly inspires the fighting spirit of the oppressed people all over the world and is a heavy blow to imperialism and revisionism.
