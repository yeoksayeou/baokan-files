The General Political Department's Cultural Bureau of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has issued a notice requiring all military units to organize screenings and propaganda work for the large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army Together." The notice states:

The large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army Together" will soon be screened nationwide. This is a great joy eagerly anticipated by revolutionary masses across the country and all cadres and soldiers in the military. Units must organize screenings quickly and effectively throughout the military, ensuring that all cadres and soldiers can see the film soon and benefit from it.

During the screening of this film, various propaganda tools such as newspapers, radio, wall newspapers, and slide shows must be fully utilized to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda work. The following points should be emphasized in the propaganda:

1. The great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao personally leads the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
2. Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary movements of the masses the most, and is heart-to-heart with the revolutionary masses.
3. The significant meaning of Chairman Mao wearing military uniform.

After the screening, discussions should be organized within the units. This is a highly honorable and significant political task. All levels of cultural departments, especially film workers, must arrange this carefully and ensure it is done well.
