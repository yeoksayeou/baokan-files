Huang Zhu is a loyal executor of Deng Tuo’s anti-party, anti-socialist art manifesto. He frequently collaborated closely with Deng Tuo, starting from counter-revolutionary political demands, using black paintings to accompany Deng Tuo’s black poems, viciously slandering and defaming the Party and socialism. For example, when a handful of right-opportunists stirred up the “three freedoms and one contract” black wind, Huang Zhu actively collaborated and released the painting “Market Day” (later, in a cowardly attempt to cover up his crimes, he changed the name to “Joyous Procession”). In the inscription for this black painting, Deng Tuo shouted that this was “a spring breeze,” “life is now better than before,” and launched a vicious attack on the people’s commune system. In many of his black paintings, Huang Zhu deliberately distorted the Party’s policies, maliciously defamed revolutionary people and soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army, and attacked the people’s army. For example, in his painting “Surrendering Sons,” which is set against the background of suppressing the rebellion of reactionary serf owners in Tibet, he depicted Tibetan laborers surrendering to the PLA, defaming the PLA’s just struggle to liberate millions of serfs as an action to suppress the Tibetan people.

Huang Zhu’s most frequent subjects are “donkeys” and “girls.” He attempted to use these idle, lewd, and vulgar images to replace the hardworking, brave, and healthy laboring people and revolutionary fighters of our socialist society; to use personal trivialities like singing, dancing, embroidery, grooming, and breastfeeding to exclude our fiery struggle; to use the decadent, even hysterical, spiritual state of the exploiting class to oppose the lofty, heroic, and spirited revolutionary sentiments of the proletariat. This “cultural profiteer” has no feelings for revolutionary work but fawns over his master Deng Tuo, flattering him shamelessly. Once, his workplace, the Chinese People’s Revolutionary Military Museum, asked him to paint a picture of the people in the revolutionary base areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan using donkeys to transport supplies for the Eighth Route Army, but he did not complete it in three years. However, in one night at the home of the anti-party element Deng Tuo, he painted a long scroll of “One Hundred Donkeys” and presented it to his master. This “donkey dealer’s” donkeys do not carry supplies for the revolution but transport black goods for counter-revolutionaries.

Before liberation, Huang Zhu joined the Three Principles of the People Youth League and the Kuomintang, actively developed reactionary organizations, and engaged in anti-communist propaganda, harboring deep hatred for the Party and socialism. His character is also extremely despicable. Not only does he paint donkeys to make money, but he also engages in speculation, colluding with Deng Tuo and others to sell ancient calligraphy and paintings illegally and make huge profits.

A large amount of irrefutable evidence proves: the so-called “famous painter” Huang Zhu, who once made a lot of noise, is a loyal lackey of the “San Jia Village” black shop, a counter-revolutionary infiltrator in the revolutionary ranks, and a greedy, five-poisoned “donkey dealer” and “cultural profiteer.”

    “三家村”的黑画家黄胄
    黄胄是邓拓反党反社会主义美术纲领的忠实执行者。他经常和邓拓密切合作，从反革命的政治要求出发，用黑画配邓拓的黑诗，对党对社会主义进行恶毒的谩骂和污蔑。例如当一小撮右倾机会主义分子刮起“三自一包”的黑风时，黄胄积极配合，抛出了描绘“自由市场”所带来“欢快”气氛的《赶集图》（后来作贼心虚地改名为《载歌行》）。邓拓在这幅黑画的题词中，就叫嚷这是“一股春风”，“生活而今胜旧时”，大肆攻击人民公社制度。黄胄在他的许多黑画中，竭力歪曲党的政策，肆意丑化革命人民和解放军战士形象，攻击人民军队。例如他的以平息西藏反动农奴主叛乱为背景的《送子投诚图》，画的竟是西藏劳动人民向解放军缴枪投降，将我军解放百万农奴的正义斗争，污蔑为镇压西藏人民的行动。
    黄胄画得最多的是“毛驴”和“少女”。他企图用那些游手好闲、飞眼吊膀的丑恶形象，来代替我们社会主义社会里勤劳勇敢、朴实健康的各族劳动人民和革命战士；用那些歌舞、绣花、梳洗、喂奶等个人身边琐事，来排斥我们热火朝天的斗争生活；用剥削阶级色情、颓废、甚至歇斯底里的精神状态，来对抗无产阶级崇高、豪迈、意气风发的革命感情。这个
  “文化奸商”对革命工作毫无感情，对他的主子邓拓却拚命巴结，曲意奉承。有一次，他所在的工作单位——中国人民革命军事博物馆，要他画一幅抗日战争时期革命根据地人民用毛驴为八路军送给养的画，他三年也没有画出来。可是，他在反党分子邓拓家里，一个晚上就画出一幅《百驴图》长卷，献给他的主子。这个“驴贩子”的毛驴，不为革命驮公粮，只为反革命运黑货。
    黄胄在解放前就参加过三青团和国民党，积极发展反动组织，进行反共宣传，对党对社会主义有着刻骨仇恨。他的品质也是极端卑劣的，不仅画驴骗钱，还进行投机倒把活动，伙同邓拓之流倒卖古字画，非法牟取暴利。
    大量确凿的事实证明：曾经喧噪一时的所谓“名画家”黄胄，是“三家村”黑店的一个忠实走狗，是混入革命部队的反革命分子，是一个唯利是图、五毒俱全的“驴贩子”、
  “文化奸商”。
