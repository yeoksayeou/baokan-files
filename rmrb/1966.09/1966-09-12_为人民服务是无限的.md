	Service to the People is Endless
	Soldier Zhou Mucun

	Last year during the total evaluation, I was rated as a Five Good Soldier, and soon after, I was promoted to squad leader. At that time, I thought to myself: I've done pretty well, if I can be rated as a Five Good Soldier this year, then I'll have a better chance of joining the Party next year. The Party branch is sure to prioritize those who have been rated as Five Good Soldiers. However, things did not go as I wished. A few months passed, and the Party branch still had not accepted me into the Party. So, I started to complain that the leadership did not care about my progress, and my work enthusiasm was also affected. I brought this problem to mind while re-reading "In Memory of Norman Bethune." I repeatedly pondered and reflected on the meaning of the words "completely" and "thoroughly," and linked them with the glorious deeds of Zhang Zedong to repeatedly examine myself. I thought, if I have made a little progress, I am satisfied. How can I talk about being "completely" and "thoroughly" dedicated? Through self-examination, I gradually came to realize: a revolutionary soldier should be like Zhang Zedong, dedicating his whole heart, his entire life, and even his life itself to the Party's cause, using it in revolutionary work, and not using it to consider personal fame and gain or to calculate personal losses. Service to the people is endless, it has no limit, and one should never be satisfied for a lifetime. In this way, I always, in every matter and in every situation, use the two measures of "completely" and "thoroughly" to evaluate myself, and use high standards to strictly demand of myself, seriously examining my every word and deed, correcting my motive for joining the Party. With the help of comrades and my own efforts, I have raised my ideological awareness. Recently, I have been honored to join the Communist Party of China.

    为人民服务是无限的
    战士　周木春
    去年总评的时候，我评上了五好战士，不久又被提升为班长。这时候，我心里想：自己已经不错了，今年评上了五好战士，明年入党就比较有把握了，党支部一定优先接收评上五好战士的同志。可是，事与愿违，过了几个月，党支部还没有接收我入党，于是自己便埋怨领导对自己进步不关心，工作劲头也受了影响。我带着这个问题重温了《为人民服务》，我反复地琢磨、反复地思考“完全”“彻底”这四个字的含义，并和张思德的光辉事迹联系起来反复检查自己。我就想，我有一点小小的进步，就满足，这怎么能谈得到“完全”、“彻底”？通过检查，我逐渐认识到：一个革命战士，应该像张思德那样把自己的全部心思、毕生精力甚至整个生命献给党的事业，用在革命工作上，不应该用在考虑个人名利地位计较个人得失上。为人民服务是无限的，是没有止境的，一辈子都不能有丝毫满足。这样，我就时时、事事、处处用“完全”、“彻底”这两把尺子来衡量自己，用高标准严格要求自己，认真检查自己的一言一行，端正入党动机。经过同志们的帮助和自己的努力，提高了思想觉悟，不久前我已光荣地参加了中国共产党。
