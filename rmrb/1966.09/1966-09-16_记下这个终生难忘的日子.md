Record This Unforgettable Day

September 15, 1966, is the most unforgettable day of my life. On this day, I was fortunate enough to see our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao inspected us Red Guards three times on Tiananmen Square, showing us the greatest trust, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest support. I will definitely not let Chairman Mao down. I will quickly bring the revolutionary spirit of the Beijing Red Guards back to my school, along with the latest directives from Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai representing the Central Committee, to make our school's Cultural Revolution even better!

Seeing Chairman Mao with my own eyes has been my greatest wish, day and night. Today, this wish has finally come true. I wish I could stand on the highest peak and shout to the 9.6 million square kilometers of our land: Chairman Mao has inspected us!

I regard Chairman Mao's inspection as the greatest political lesson of my life. The immense spiritual encouragement will turn into boundless material strength. In the long revolutionary journey ahead, no matter how great the difficulties, as long as I think of this happy inspection, I will be full of energy, daring to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire!

At around 6:20 PM on September 15, Chairman Mao arrived at the southwest corner of Tiananmen Gate. He warmly smiled and waved to us. We, with tears in our eyes, shouted, "Long live, long live, long live Chairman Mao!"

Dear Chairman Mao, I am the son of a poor peasant. Now, I have come to your side and received your inspection. I have only one wish: to be your most loyal little red soldier, to carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and to carry out the socialist revolution to the end!

I came from the front lines of the sea defense to the heart of the motherland, the world's Yan'an—Beijing, and saw our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. This is the greatest happiness of my life!

Chairman Mao, in those long years of struggle, you led our fathers and mothers to traverse thousands of mountains and rivers, creating a new world for the proletariat. Today, you lead us again, igniting the blazing flames of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. We will definitely sweep away all ghosts and monsters, burning away all the remnants of the old world.

    记下这个终生难忘的日子
    一九六六年九月十五日，是我一生中最难忘的一天。在这一天里，我幸福地见到了最最敬爱的领袖毛主席！
    毛主席三次在天安门广场上接见我们红卫兵，是对我们最大的信任，最大的鼓舞，最大的支持。我坚决不辜负毛主席的期望，一定尽快地把北京红卫兵的革命造反精神带回去，把林彪同志、周恩来同志代表中央所作的最新指示带回去，使我们学校里的文化大革命搞得好上加好！

    亲眼见到毛主席，是我日也盼、夜也盼的最大的心愿。我在今天终于实现了这个心愿。我恨不得马上站在高山之巅，向着九百多万平方公里的大地高呼：毛主席检阅我们了！
    我把毛主席这次检阅，当作是我一生中最大最大的政治课。巨大的精神鼓舞将化成无穷的物质力量。在今后漫长的革命道路上，哪怕遇到天大的困难，只要想起这次幸福的检阅，我就一定会浑身是劲，刀山敢上，火海敢闯！

    九月十五日下午六点二十分左右，毛主席来到了天安门城楼的西南角。他老人家亲切地微笑着向我们招手，我们热泪盈眶地向他老人家高呼：“万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    敬爱的毛主席，我是一个贫农的儿子。现在，我来到了您老人家身边，接受了您老人家的检阅。我只有一个心愿：誓作您的最忠实的红小兵，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底！

    我从海防前线来到了祖国的心脏，世界的延安——北京，见到了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席。这是我一生中最大的幸福！
    毛主席呵，在那漫长的战斗岁月里，您领导着我们的爸爸妈妈踏遍了万水千山，开创了一个无产阶级的新天地。今天，您又领导我们，点燃起无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，我们一定能横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，烧掉旧世界遗留下来的所有残渣余孽。
