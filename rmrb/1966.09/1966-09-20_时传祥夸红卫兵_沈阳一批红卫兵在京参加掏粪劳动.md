Many Red Guards from Shenyang responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's call to learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers. Today, in Beijing, they joined national labor model worker Shi Chuanxiang and others in latrine cleaning.

Early this morning, thirty Red Guards from Shenyang City's Songling Semi-Work-Study Secondary Technical School sang revolutionary songs as they arrived at the designated work site, where Shi Chuanxiang had agreed to meet them. They studied Chairman Mao's quotations while waiting for the worker comrades.

Shi Chuanxiang arrived at the work site and was delighted to see the young students already there.

Shi Chuanxiang was very happy to be with these vigorous Red Guards. During the labor, he held the hands of each young comrade, patiently teaching them how to use the shovel, how to swing the latrine frame, and how to dump the waste into the latrine cart. When a female Red Guard insisted on carrying a full bucket of waste, Shi Chuanxiang stopped her and said affectionately, "You coming to work is not about carrying how much waste, but about understanding the significance of participating in labor. Today, we are not just cleaning latrines, but digging out the roots of capitalism and revisionism from every dark corner. We must uproot and smash the roots of capitalism and revisionism!"

The Red Guards participating in the labor worked hard, unafraid of dirt or fatigue, and were always eager to learn from the workers. Many of them repeatedly expressed their determination to respond to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's call, to unite with the workers and peasants, and to learn the revolutionary spirit and excellent qualities of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants. Shi Chuanxiang, seeing the Red Guards' eagerness to learn, excitedly said, "You came from Shenyang to Beijing for revolutionary linkage and labored with us latrine cleaners. You truly are good soldiers educated by Chairman Mao. You must always listen to Chairman Mao, always be close to the workers and peasants, be good children of the people, and diligently serve the people all your life."

During a break, a few activists who study Chairman Mao's works and some Young Pioneers from the neighborhood brought water to the latrine cleaners and students. As everyone drank water, Shi Chuanxiang, moved, said to the Red Guards, "Every time I receive water from the Young Pioneers, I am so touched that I cry. In the old society, we latrine cleaners were oppressed and exploited by the dung lords, living a life worse than cattle and horses. The bourgeoisie looked down on us, thinking we were dirty and smelly. Today, under Chairman Mao's leadership, we have finally become masters of society, living a happy life we never had before." Shi Chuanxiang's story of liberation deeply moved the Red Guards. Some said, "Looking back at the past and thinking about the present, we feel even more fortunate to live in the big family of socialist motherland. We must never forget class suffering, remember blood debts, and defend proletarian dictatorship to the end, carrying out the Cultural Revolution to the end!"

The labor ended, and the students enthusiastically gathered around Shi Chuanxiang. They said, "Today, working with the worker comrades, though the time was short, we received great education and had a vivid political lesson. Our latrine cleaners, though their bodies are dirty, their hearts are the reddest, and they are the most loyal to the Party and Chairman Mao. We must learn from the latrine cleaners and the broad masses of workers and peasants, and always be steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

    时传祥夸红卫兵
    沈阳一批红卫兵在京参加掏粪劳动
    据新华社十九日讯  来自沈阳的许多红卫兵热烈响应毛主席和党中央发出的向工农兵学习的伟大号召，今天在北京同全国劳动模范时传祥等一起，参加了掏粪劳动。
    今天一清早，沈阳市松陵半工半读中等技术学校的三十名红卫兵，就高唱着革命歌曲，来到了同时传祥事先约好的劳动地点。他们一边学习毛主席语录，一边等候着时传祥等工人同志。
    时传祥来到劳动现场，看到青年学生们早就来到这里，高兴极了。
    时传祥同这群生龙活虎般的红卫兵在一起，心里很高兴。劳动中，他把着一个个小将的手，耐心地教他们怎样使用粪勺，怎样摇粪架，怎样把粪倒进粪车里。有一个女红卫兵抢着要背一只装得满满的粪桶，时传祥看到后劝止了她，亲切地对她说：“你们来劳动，不在于背多少粪，重要的是要认识参加劳动的意义。今天我们不仅仅是在掏粪，而是在掏资本主义、修正主义的根子。我们一定要把资本主义、修正主义的根子从一切阴暗的角落里挖出来，砸它个稀巴烂！”
    参加劳动的红卫兵们，干活不怕脏，不怕累，随时虚心向工人请教、学习。许多人都一再表示，他们决心响应党中央和毛主席的号召，一定要同工农群众打成一片，学习工人阶级和贫农下中农的革命精神和优秀品质。时传祥看到红卫兵们这种好学精神，兴奋地说：“你们从沈阳来北京，进行革命串连，又和我们掏粪工人一起劳动，你们真不愧为毛主席教育出来的好战士。你们要永远听毛主席的话，永远和工农群众心连心，做劳动人民的好儿女，勤勤恳恳地做一辈子人民的勤务员。”
    休息的时候，街道上的几个学习毛主席著作积极分子和少先队员，给掏粪工人和学生们送来了开水。在大家喝水时，时传祥激动地对红卫兵们说，每当我接过红领巾送来的开水，我就感动得流下了眼泪。在旧社会，我们掏粪工人受尽粪霸的压迫和剥削，过着牛马不如的生活。资产阶级老爷们嫌我们又脏又臭，根本瞧不起我们。今天，我们在毛主席的领导下，终于成了社会的主人，过着从来没有过的幸福生活。时传祥的翻身史，深深地感动着红卫兵，有的人说，看看过去，想想现在，更使我们感到生活在社会主义祖国大家庭里真是无限幸福。我们一定要不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，誓死保卫无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    劳动结束了，学生们热情地围着时传祥。他们说，今天和工人同志一起劳动，时间虽然不长，但是受到了很大教育，使我们上了一堂生动的政治课。我们的掏粪工人，身上有粪渍，但是他们的心最红，他们对党对毛主席最热爱，最忠诚。我们一定要向掏粪工人和广大工农群众学习，永远做一个坚定的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
