The Indian ruling clique, executing reactionary domestic and foreign policies that fundamentally contradict the interests of the Indian people, has encountered numerous difficulties. Internal disputes within the clique have become increasingly intense.

According to the Indian weekly *Flash*, there are "disagreements," "differences," and "fissures" between the president of the Indian National Congress, Kamaraj, and Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The British *Times* reported that Indira Gandhi is facing fierce attacks from the most influential faction within the Indian National Congress and is essentially isolated.

Recent reports in Indian newspapers have revealed that relations within the Indian National Congress in various states are "very tense," with "intrigue and backstabbing," and that infighting within the organization is intensifying and weakening it.

Within all the states of India, there are factional conflicts within the Indian National Congress. In West Bengal, Kerala, and Orissa, the Indian National Congress has openly split, forming parallel organizations. The disputes within the Indian National Congress in Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and the Indian-occupied areas of Kashmir have also become public. These disputes do not reflect policy differences but are struggles for power and personal gain.

Currently, Indian political parties have begun campaigning for the general elections scheduled for next February. In this farce of bourgeois democracy that deceives the people, the struggle for power and personal gain among the various political factions representing Indian monopolistic capital and feudal forces will further intensify. According to reports in Indian newspapers, due to the current government's "poor image," some within the Indian National Congress have proposed reorganizing the government before the elections to deceive voters.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recently admitted that India is facing "frightening" problems and is "going through the most difficult period since independence."

    印度统治集团在内外交困中激烈争吵
    英迪拉·甘地承认印度面临着“最困难的时期”
    新华社十八日讯　新德里消息：印度统治集团执行反动的内外政策，根本违背印度人民的利益，遭到了重重困难，它的内部争吵也愈来愈激烈。
    据印度《闪电》周报透露，在印度执政党国大党主席卡马拉季和印度总理英迪拉·甘地之间存在着“分歧”、“隔阂”和“裂缝”。英国《泰晤士报》说，英迪拉·甘地受到国大党内最有影响的一部分人对她的猛烈攻击，实际上是孤立的。
    印度报纸最近透露了国大党各邦组织内“关系很紧张”、“勾心斗角”、“使整个组织削弱的内讧加剧”等等。
    在印度的所有各个邦内，国大党组织内部存在着派系矛盾。在西孟加拉、喀拉拉、奥里萨这三个邦内，国大党已公开分裂，成立了平行的组织。北方邦、安德拉邦和克什米尔印度占领区内的国大党内部的争吵也已经公开化。这些争吵并不反映政策的分歧，而是争权夺利的斗争。
    目前，印度的政党已经开始为明年二月的大选进行竞选活动。在这场欺骗人民的资产阶级民主丑剧中，代表印度垄断资本和封建势力的各个政治派系之间的争权夺利的斗争将要进一步激化。据印度报纸报道，由于目前的政府“形象很糟”，国大党曾有人酝酿在大选前改组政府来骗取选票。
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地最近承认，印度面临“令人害怕”的问题，“正在经历着独立以来最困难的时期”。
