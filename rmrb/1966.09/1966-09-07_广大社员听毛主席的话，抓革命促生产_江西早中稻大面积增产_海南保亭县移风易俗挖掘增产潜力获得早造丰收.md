In the struggle for production, Jiangxi Province, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has achieved a large-scale and substantial increase in early and mid-season rice this year. According to preliminary statistics from various places, the total yield and yield per unit area of early and mid-season rice in the province have both increased by more than 10% compared to last year. The area with the highest increase, Fuzhou Prefecture, saw a 29.9% increase in the total yield of early and mid-season rice compared to last year. Some counties, communes, and production teams have achieved a single-season yield of early rice that is close to, reaches, or exceeds the total yield of the entire year last year.

Jiangxi Province has achieved a bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice for four consecutive years. This year, the process of seizing a bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice in this province was one of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, continuously arming the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide agricultural production. During the spring plowing season, various places encountered prolonged rain and low temperatures, causing serious seedling rot and seedling decay in many places, bringing great difficulties to spring plowing production. In this situation, local party organizations insisted on taking Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, organizing cadres and the masses to widely study Chairman Mao's "Qufo Moves the Mountains," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Abolish Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," and repeatedly conducted ideological education for revolutionary farming. This mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, overcoming the difficulties caused by prolonged rain and low temperatures in seedling raising and transplanting.

During the rice growth period, the party organizations at all levels in this province carried out an in-depth campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. The broad masses of cadres and the people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, fully carried forward the spirit of daring to struggle, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting, launching a production high tide in field management, and doing everything possible to ensure the vigorous growth of seedlings.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 5th, the Li and Miao ethnic minorities in Baoting County, Hainan, studied Chairman Mao's works, used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, grasped the revolution and promoted production, and achieved a bumper harvest of early-season rice and other crops this year. The total yield of early rice increased by 49.2% compared to last year; spring sweet potatoes (i.e., sweet potatoes) increased by 38%; peanuts increased by 1.7 times compared to last year. Cash income also increased several times.

Since last autumn, the broad masses of cadres and commune members in this county have studied the comments written by Chairman Mao for "In Two Years, This Village Achieved Cooperativization," "Who Says Chicken Feathers Can't Fly to the Sky," and the articles "Introducing a Cooperative," "Qufo Moves the Mountains," discussing issues such as "Can chicken feathers fly to the sky," "Farming for the revolution," and "The relationship between politics and production." The leading organs of the county organized cadres and commune members to hold on-site meetings in various high-yield areas of the county, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to expose production shortcomings, tap potential for increased production, emphasize the primacy of human factors, and break free from various old ideas, old habits, and old frameworks. The ethnic minorities broke away from old customs such as men not transplanting seedlings and women not plowing fields, and abolished various taboos that prevented them from working in the fields. Mountains that were previously considered uncultivable, such as "Ghost Mountain," "Leprosy Mountain," and "Locust Mountain," are now all cultivated and planted with crops.

Each commune and production team also universally changed customs, extensively used human and animal manure for fertilization, and increased the amount of fertilizer by more than one fold compared to last year.

    广大社员听毛主席的话，抓革命促生产
    江西早中稻大面积增产
    海南保亭县移风易俗挖掘增产潜力获得早造丰收
    据新华社南昌五日电　在生产斗争中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的江西省，今年二千五百多万亩早稻和中稻，又获得了大面积大幅度增产。据各地初步统计，全省早稻、中稻的总产量和单位面积产量分别比去年增产一成以上。增产幅度最大的抚州专区，今年早稻、中稻的总产量比去年猛增百分之二十九点九。有些县、社、队早稻一季产量就接近、达到或超过去年全年的总产量。
    江西省的早稻和中稻已经连续四年获得了丰收。今年，这个省夺取早稻、中稻丰收的过程，是活学活用毛主席著作，不断用毛泽东思想武装农民，用毛泽东思想指导农业生产的过程。在春耕生产期间，各地遇到了久雨低温天气，使许多地方造成了严重的烂种烂秧现象，给春耕生产带来了极大的困难。在这种情况下，各地党组织坚持以毛泽东思想挂帅，广泛组织干部和群众学习毛主席的《愚公移山》、《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》、《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，反复进行为革命种田的思想教育，从而调动了广大干部和群众的革命积极性，战胜了久雨低温天气给育秧、插秧造成的困难。
    在水稻生长期间，这个省的各级党组织又深入地开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。广大干部和群众按照毛主席的教导，充分发扬敢于斗争、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的精神，掀起了田间管理的生产高潮，千方百计地保证了禾苗的茁壮生长。
    据新华社广州五日电　海南黎族苗族自治州的保亭县黎族人民大学毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，抓革命促生产，今年早造水稻和其他各种作物都获得了大丰收。早稻总产量比去年增长百分之四十九点二；春番薯（即甘薯）增产百分之三十八；花生比去年增产一点七倍。现金收入也成倍增加。
    去秋以来，这个县的广大干部和社员大学毛主席为《这个乡两年就合作化了》、《谁说鸡毛不能上天》等文章写的按语，和毛主席写的《介绍一个合作社》、《愚公移山》等文章，讨论了“鸡毛能不能上天”、“为革命种田”、“政治与生产的关系”等问题。这个县的领导机关又组织干部、社员到本县的各高产地区开现场会议，以毛泽东思想为武器，大揭生产盖子，大挖增产潜力，强调人的因素第一，打破各种各样旧思想、旧习惯、旧框框的束缚。少数民族人民破除了男人不插秧、女人不犁田等旧习俗，废除了种种不能下田的“禁忌日”。历来被认为不能耕作的“鬼山”、“麻疯山”、“蚂蝗山”，现在全都开垦出来种上了作物。
    各社队还普遍移风易俗，大用人粪尿肥田，施肥量比去年增加一倍以上。
