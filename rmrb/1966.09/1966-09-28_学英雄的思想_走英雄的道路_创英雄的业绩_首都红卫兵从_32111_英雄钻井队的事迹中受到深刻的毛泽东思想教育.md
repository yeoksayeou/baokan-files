The heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team fighting through a raging fire to save a gas well have deeply and vividly educated the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary students in Beijing with Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary youngsters, after studying the deeds of this heroic drilling team, were all stirred with enthusiasm and spirit, unanimously declaring that they would, like the heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team, regard reading Chairman Mao's books as the first necessity of life, turn Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, resolutely learn the heroes' thoughts, walk the heroes' path, and create heroes' achievements, forever becoming Chairman Mao's good soldiers.

On the morning of the 26th, Red Guards from various universities and middle schools in the capital listened to the broadcast of the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team, seriously studied the deeds of the drilling team heroes and the editorial "Mao Zedong Thought is the Soul of the Revolutionary People" from the People's Daily, and wrote big-character posters and held discussions, enthusiastically praising the heroes of this heroic drilling team as worthy successors of Chairman Mao's good workers. Revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University solemnly declared in a telegram to the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team: "We will definitely learn the revolutionary spirit and noble qualities of the heroes, regard reading Chairman Mao's books as the first necessity of life, turn Mao Zedong Thought into our souls, turn the execution of Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious revolutionary actions, regard revolutionary interests as our first life, and hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, march forward bravely!"

Many Red Guards from Beijing Petroleum Institute, Beijing No. 31 Middle School, and other universities and middle schools believe that the heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team, just as Chairman Mao instructed, "This army has the spirit of pressing on regardless of all obstacles and difficulties, to overwhelm and destroy all enemies, rather than be overwhelmed and destroyed. In any event, however difficult and dangerous, as long as there is one person, that person must continue the fight." Red Guards from Beijing No. 31 Middle School said: Learning from the 32111 Heroic Drilling Team, the fundamental principle is to, like the heroes, "imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions." Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from Beijing Mining Institute declared that they would definitely learn the proletarian heroic spirit of the 32111 Drilling Team, unite under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought like the heroes, not only strive to be good individuals but also to be a good collective, forever red together, fighting together, and turn the Red Guards into a heroic collective.

Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and staff from Peking University wrote to the school's publication "New Peking University," expressing their determination to learn from the heroes, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, charge into the forefront of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely complete the tasks of one struggle, two line struggles, and three reforms, and at the same time, transform their subjective world, cultivating themselves into strong successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Red Guards from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute, Beijing Girls' No. 8 Middle School, and other universities and middle schools, together with revolutionary students from outside Beijing, studied and discussed the heroic deeds of the 32111 Drilling Team.
