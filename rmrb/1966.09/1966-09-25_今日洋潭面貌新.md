	Today, Yangtan has a new look. In early June, I returned to my hometown—Yangtan in the Shaoshan Irrigation District of Hunan Province—after five years of absence. Yangtan has undergone a complete transformation. The mountains are covered with terraced fields, and the water flowing through the terraces makes a rushing sound. Even more impressive is the high water diversion dam built at the confluence of the Lian River and the Feng River. The original treacherous rapids and cliffs have been replaced by a massive concrete dam. The dam, constructed with steel and concrete, spans the raging river, and the once turbulent waters now flow obediently through the sluice gates, following the will of the people and flowing to designated areas. The desolate old scene of Yangtan has been washed away, and the days of "three days of rain and water overflowing, three days without rain and water like oil" are gone forever!

	The next day after my return, an elderly man from the dam management office took me to the top of the dam and pointed out the winding main canal. He explained the engineering details to me. It turns out that this is one of the major water conservancy projects in the Central South region. The main canal and the North Canal pass through more than seventy hills, cross over eighty streams and gullies, and stretch across the hilly areas of Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, and Ningxiang counties, playing a significant role in agricultural development. The old man also recounted the situation at the completion and water diversion ceremony of the project and the speech given by Vice Premier Tao Zhu at the meeting.

	Just as the old man was speaking enthusiastically, the song "The Great Sea Navigates with the Helmsman" suddenly echoed from the valley. What a stirring song! As I listened, my gaze involuntarily turned to the dam. At that moment, it seemed as if Tao Zhu's speech was resonating loudly in my ears: The completion and water diversion of the Shaoshan Irrigation District's main canal and North Canal is another brilliant achievement of Mao Zedong Thought. The construction of this project proves that revolutionary people, as long as they act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, can generate boundless wisdom and strength, and can continuously make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress in all endeavors!

    今日洋潭面貌新
    某部战士　谢永
    六月初，我回到了离别五年的家乡——湖南韶山灌区的洋潭。洋潭的面貌焕然一新。满山遍野，层层梯田，流过梯田的渠水哗啦啦响。更壮观的是，在涟河水和峰水汇合点，原来的险滩绝壁上，筑起了一座高大的引水坝。用钢筋水泥筑成的堤坝，横跨激流，奔腾咆哮的河水，乖乖地流过排水闸口，按照人们的意志，流向指定的地方。洋潭那荒凉的旧景被冲刷得一干二净，“三天大雨水自流，三天无雨水如油”的时代一去不复返了！
    回家的第二天，水坝管理办公室的一位老人把我领到坝顶上，指着曲折延绵的总干渠，对我讲了工程情况。原来这是中南地区大型水利工程之一，总干渠和北干渠穿过七十多座山岭，跨越八十多条溪河、山冲，纵横伸展在湘乡、湘潭、宁乡三县的丘陵地带，对发展农业起很大作用。老人还给我讲述了工程竣工通水典礼情况和陶铸副总理在大会上的讲话。
    老人正讲得起劲的时候，突然从山沟里传出了《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声。这是多么激动人心的歌声呀！我听着听着，目光不由自主地投向堤坝，此刻，陶铸同志的讲话仿佛在我耳边宏亮地响起：韶山灌区总干渠和北干渠竣工通水，是毛泽东思想又一次的光辉成就，这项工程的兴建证明：革命人民，只要按照毛主席的指示办事，就能产生无限的智慧和力量，就能在各项事业中，不断的有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进！
