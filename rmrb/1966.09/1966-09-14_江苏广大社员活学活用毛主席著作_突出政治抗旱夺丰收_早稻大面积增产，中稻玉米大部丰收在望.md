	Jiangsu's broad masses of farmers are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing politics in the fight against drought to secure a bumper harvest. Early rice has seen a large-scale balanced increase in yield, and most of the middle rice and corn are expected to have a good harvest.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 13th: Jiangsu Province's rural broad masses of farmers are actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, focusing on revolution and promoting production, making the province's agricultural production present a very good situation: the early rice that has been harvested has achieved a large-scale balanced increase in yield; the more than ten million mu of middle rice and corn that are currently being harvested, except for some areas severely affected by drought, are expected to have a good harvest; late-season crops such as late rice and cotton, which have relatively high yields per unit area, are also growing well.

	This year, most of Jiangsu Province has suffered from severe drought. In the fight against drought, various places have insisted on emphasizing politics, organizing the masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's "Qu Fong Moves the Mountain" and "Abandon Illusions, Prepare for Struggle" and related quotations, raising the class consciousness of the broad masses of farmers, further recognizing the great significance of farming for the revolution, and thus strengthening their resolve to fight against drought and secure a bumper harvest. The broad masses of farmers, with a spirit of fearing neither heaven nor earth, are resolutely fighting against the drought, using every means to find water sources, and irrigating the drought-affected fields.

	In the struggle to secure a bumper harvest this year, many places, in accordance with the spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have broken with the old and established the new, promoting various advanced production experiences.

	To ensure the dual victory of revolution and production, the places in this province that are currently carrying out the socialist education movement have organized two sets of cadres, focusing on both revolution and production. Many party and government leadership organs have also sent out a large number of cadres to set up model points, leading by example, and launching a campaign of learning from each other and helping each other to catch up and surpass. At present, the cadres and farmers of this province are advancing with an unyielding revolutionary spirit. On the one hand, they are persistently doing a good job of late-season crop management, striving for an all-around bumper harvest for the whole year, and on the other hand, they are actively preparing for the autumn sowing, striving to complete this autumn's sowing task at a high standard and high quality, laying a solid foundation for next year's agricultural increase in production.

    江苏广大社员活学活用毛主席著作
    突出政治抗旱夺丰收
    早稻大面积增产，中稻玉米大部丰收在望
    据新华社南京十三日电　江苏省农村广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命，促生产，使全省农业生产出现了一派大好形势：已经登场的早稻获得了大面积平衡增产；正在收打的一千多万亩中稻和玉米等作物，除一部分受旱严重的以外，大部分可望丰收；单位面积产量一向较高的晚稻和棉花等晚秋作物也生长良好。
    今年江苏省大部分地区遭到严重干旱，各地在抗旱斗争中坚持突出政治，组织群众认真学习毛主席的《愚公移山》《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等著作和有关语录，使广大社员提高了阶级觉悟，进一步认识到为革命种田的重大意义，从而增强了抗旱夺丰收的决心。广大社员都用天不怕地不怕的精神，和干旱进行坚决的斗争，千方百计寻找水源，灌溉受旱田地。
    在夺取今年农业丰收的斗争中，很多地方根据无产阶级文化大革命的精神，破旧立新，推广各种先进生产经验。
    为了保证革命、生产双胜利，这个省目前正在搞社会主义教育运动的地方，都组织了两套班子，一手抓革命，一手抓生产。许多党政领导机关还派出大批干部，蹲点搞样板，以点带面，开展比学赶帮超运动。现在，这个省的干部、社员，正以不断革命的精神，乘胜前进。一面坚持不懈地搞好晚秋作物的后期管理，力争全年全面丰收，一面积极搞好秋播准备，力争高标准高质量地完成今年秋播任务，为明年农业增产打好基础。
