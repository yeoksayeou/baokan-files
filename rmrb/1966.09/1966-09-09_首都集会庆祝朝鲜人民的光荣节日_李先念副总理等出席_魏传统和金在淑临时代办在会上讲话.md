Beijing, Sept. 8 (Xinhua) - A grand gathering was held in the capital this afternoon to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, and Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Chu Tunan, along with other relevant officials and representatives of the Red Guards from the capital, attended the meeting.

Wei Chuantong, Vice Chairman of the China-Korea Friendship Association, and Kim Jaesuk, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim, delivered speeches at the meeting, expressing their wishes for the continuous strengthening and development of the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Korea.

Wei Chuantong, in his speech, praised the achievements of the Korean people under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung in the cause of socialist construction.

He said that the facts have proven that without driving the U.S. imperialists out of South Korea, there can be no talk of achieving the unification of Korea. He expressed that the Chinese people firmly support the heroic struggle of the fraternal Korean people for the unification of their country.

Speaking about the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people, Wei Chuantong said that the U.S. aggressors have already fallen into the sea of flames of the Vietnamese people's war. The victory of the Vietnamese people once again proves that U.S. imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger that can be defeated; revolutionary people who dare to struggle and persist in struggle are invincible.

Wei Chuantong strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's policy of fake support and real betrayal in the issue of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation struggle. He said that the Soviet revisionist leadership, in collusion with the reactionaries of various countries led by the United States, has formed a new holy alliance against communism, against the people, against revolution, and against China. This counter-revolutionary holy alliance is doomed to fail.

Wei Chuantong said that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose modern revisionism. In the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, there is no middle ground. Regarding the modern revisionist group centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, it is necessary to draw a clear line and expose their true faces as renegades and scabs; it is impossible to engage in any "joint actions" with them.

Wei Chuantong said that at present, our country is full of revolutionary fervor, and a new comprehensive leap is emerging. Our national economy is developing steadily and healthily. Now, an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is rapidly and powerfully underway in our country. This will fundamentally change the spiritual face of our entire society, greatly consolidate our proletarian dictatorship, and thoroughly smash the dreams of imperialism and all reactionaries of restoring capitalism in China. We must follow the instructions of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and carry the socialist revolution to the end.

Wei Chuantong concluded by saying that the Chinese people will, as always, strengthen and develop the friendship between the peoples of China and Korea on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

Kim Jaesuk, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim, in his speech, introduced the great achievements of the Korean people under the leadership of Comrade Kim Il-sung in successfully carrying out the socialist revolution and in socialist construction.

He strongly condemned the U.S. imperialists for occupying South Korea and turning it into a colony and military base. He said that no matter how brutally the U.S. imperialists and the Park Chung-hee clique suppress, they cannot stop the anti-U.S. national salvation struggle of the South Korean people. The people of South and North Korea will unite in a nationwide struggle to drive the U.S. imperialist invaders out of South Korea and achieve the unification of their country.

Kim Jaesuk said that the Korean people firmly condemn the provocative actions of U.S. imperialism against the People's Republic of China and firmly support the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. The Korean people regard the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle and will do everything in their power to support the Vietnamese people.

Kim Jaesuk praised the Chinese people, saying that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, they have hoisted the banner of self-reliance and achieved great victories in socialist construction.

    首都集会庆祝朝鲜人民的光荣节日
    李先念副总理等出席　魏传统和金在淑临时代办在会上讲话
    据新华社八日讯　首都各界今天下午举行大会，庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国成立十八周年。
    国务院副总理李先念，外交部副部长罗贵波，对外文委副主任楚图南等有关方面负责人，以及首都的红卫兵代表们出席了大会。
    中朝友协副会长魏传统和金在淑临时代办先后在会上讲话，共祝中朝两国人民的战斗友谊不断加强和发展。
    魏传统在讲话中赞扬了朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在社会主义建设事业中取得了巨大的成就。
    他说，事实证明，不把美帝国主义从南朝鲜赶出去，就谈不上实现朝鲜的统一。他表示中国人民坚决支持兄弟的朝鲜人民为统一祖国而进行的英勇斗争。
    在谈到越南人民正在进行的抗美救国斗争时，魏传统说，美国侵略者已经陷入了越南人民战争的火海之中。越南人民的胜利再一次证明了美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎，是完全可以被打败的；敢于斗争、坚持斗争的革命人民是不可战胜的。
    魏传统强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在越南抗美救国斗争的问题上实行假支持、真出卖的反革命两面政策。他说，苏联修正主义领导集团联合以美国为首的各国反动派，结成一个反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的新神圣同盟。这种反革命神圣同盟是注定要失败的。
    魏传统说，要反对帝国主义就必须反对现代修正主义。在马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，是没有中间道路可走的。对于以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义集团，必须划清界限，揭露他们工贼的真面目，不可能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。
    魏传统说，目前，我国全国到处是一片热气腾腾的革命景象，正在出现新的全面跃进的局面。我国的国民经济正在持续地健康地向前发展。现在，一个史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命正在我国迅速地、猛烈地进行。这必将从根本上改变我们整个社会的精神面貌，大大巩固我们的无产阶级专政，彻底粉碎帝国主义和一切反动派期望资本主义在中国复辟的梦想。我们一定要按照八届十一中全会的指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    魏传统最后说，中国人民将一如既往在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上，加强和发展中朝两国人民的友谊。
    金在淑临时代办在讲话中介绍了朝鲜人民在金日成同志领导下胜利地进行了社会主义革命，在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就。
    他强烈谴责美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜，把南朝鲜完全变为它的殖民地和军事基地。他说，美帝国主义和朴正熙集团的任何残暴镇压，阻挡不了南朝鲜人民的反美救国斗争。南北朝鲜人民展开全民斗争，一定要把美帝国主义侵略者赶出南朝鲜，实现祖国的统一。
    金在淑临时代办说，朝鲜人民坚决谴责美帝国主义对中华人民共和国的挑衅行为，坚决支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争。朝鲜人民把越南人民的斗争看做是自己的斗争，竭尽一切力量支援越南人民。
    金在淑赞扬说，兄弟的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，高举自力更生的革命旗帜，在社会主义建设中取得了巨大的胜利。
