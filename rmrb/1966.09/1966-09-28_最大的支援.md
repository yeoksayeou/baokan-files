In April of this year, a cold snap struck the area where a certain military academy is located, causing over 60 percent of the early rice seedlings in a nearby production brigade to rot. With the early rice transplanting season approaching, the poor and lower-middle peasants were all very anxious.

Cadet Huang Dajian learned about this situation. He thought: To solve the problem of early rice planting, we must first overcome the peasants' pessimistic and passive attitudes. The greatest support is to arm the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought. The political instructor fully agreed with Huang Dajian's idea. The next day, Huang Dajian took Mao Zedong's works and lunch to the production brigade to guide their study. Huang Dajian, combining the brigade's specific situation, organized everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and relevant quotations from Chairman Mao. Through their study, the peasants unanimously recognized that disasters are not to be feared; what is to be feared is losing confidence and courage, and wavering in the face of disasters, which shakes one's resolve to strive for a bumper harvest.

After the peasants raised their awareness, in the afternoon, Huang Dajian inspired everyone to analyze the current production situation, with everyone contributing ideas and finding solutions, ultimately coming up with a way to solve the problem of early rice planting.

Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, everyone together overcame the disaster and achieved a full bumper harvest of early rice. The peasants never forgot that when they encountered the disaster, it was the PLA comrades who brought them Mao Zedong Thought, guiding them to plant the early rice in time.

    最大的支援
    今年四月，解放军某校所在地区遭到寒流侵袭，附近生产队的早稻秧烂了百分之六十多。眼看早稻插秧季节就要过去了，贫下中农心里都很焦急。
    学员黄大建知道了这个情况。他想：要解决早稻的播种问题，首先需要克服社员的悲观消极情绪。用毛泽东思想去武装社员们的头脑，是最大的支援。指导员非常赞同黄大建的想法。第二天，黄大建带着毛主席著作和中午吃的干粮，到生产队去辅导学习。黄大建结合生产队的具体情况，组织大家学习了《愚公移山》和有关毛主席语录。社员们通过学习，一致认识到灾害并不可怕，可怕的是丧失信心和勇气，在灾害面前动摇了争取丰收的决心。
    社员们提高认识以后，下午，黄大建又启发大家分析当前的生产形势，人人出主意，想办法，终于找到了解决播种早稻的办法。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，大家一起战胜了灾害，取得了早稻全面丰收。社员们一刻没有忘记在他们遇到灾害的时候，是解放军同志给他们送来了毛泽东思想，指导他们及时播种了早稻。
