In late August, with hearts brimming with excitement, we rushed to the great capital, the center of proletarian revolution—Beijing. There, we were fortunate to see our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, the brightest red sun we had longed to see day and night. There, we visited the heroic Red Guards of the capital and engaged in revolutionary linkage activities. Now, whenever we recall those unforgettable days, our blood boils, and we cannot calm down. Chairman Mao, we have come to your side.

We left Shanghai for Beijing on August 23. At that time, we had just established our Red Guard combat organization. Each of us had a burning heart and a fierce fighting spirit, vowing to be loyal guards of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. To ensure that we fight bravely from the start along the path indicated by Chairman Mao, we yearned to go to Beijing, to directly hear Chairman Mao's great call, and to see how the Red Guards by Chairman Mao's side fight and revolutionize. Therefore, when we boarded the train to Beijing, we were extremely excited and elated, with countless thoughts converging into one: fly to Beijing!

The train crossed the Yangtze River, traversed the Yellow River, and arrived at the radiant city of Beijing. As we stepped off the train and onto the ground where Chairman Mao resides, our hearts felt warm, and countless words of excitement surged to our lips. We immediately ran to the post office at the station to send a telegram to our fellow students in Shanghai. At this moment, no amount of words could express our inner excitement, and no matter how long the telegram, it could not fully convey our shared exhilaration. So, we sent this telegram: "Five people arrived in Beijing. Long live Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we, your little soldiers, have come to your side. From the bottom of our hearts, we shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!"

Beijing, the source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is a sea of red flags and a tide of cheers, with a revolutionary scene of fervent activity everywhere, and the golden light of Mao Zedong Thought shining everywhere. In the train station, we saw walls covered with Chairman Mao's quotations and revolutionary leaflets. Even the underground passages of the station were the same. The great revolutionary people of Beijing truly love, believe in, and worship the great leader Chairman Mao. We boarded a public bus, and saw Chairman Mao's portrait solemnly hanging inside, with Chairman Mao's quotations posted. Revolutionary students led everyone in seriously reciting Chairman Mao's quotations and singing "The East Is Red" with all their hearts. Wherever we went, whether on big streets or small alleys, every lane had Chairman Mao's quotation boards. In the conversations of the capital's people, they often mentioned, "Chairman Mao said..." These moving examples made us deeply feel that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is engraved in the hearts of the people of the capital. Chairman Mao's words are the criteria for action and the source of strength. The entire city of Beijing is becoming a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. We feel extremely honored and happy to be able to study in such a revolutionary school.

The Red Guards of the capital, nurtured under the brilliant and great Mao Zedong Thought, truly deserve to be the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and have made tremendous contributions to the Party and the people. These revolutionary youngsters, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to think, dare to venture, dare to act, dare to revolutionize, and dare to rebel. In the struggle to sweep away all ghosts and monsters, they charge forward fearlessly. In the revolutionary struggle to destroy the old and establish the new, they are invincible. They are disciplined, good at struggle, closely linked with the masses, and seriously follow the sixteen points personally formulated by Chairman Mao. Therefore, they enjoy high prestige among the people of Beijing. We saw on the streets of Beijing that whenever a squad of Red Guards marched past in an orderly manner, the revolutionary masses always looked at them with respect and praised their achievements. Many workers in various units, together with the Red Guards, exposed a batch of parasites and bloodsuckers who had been hiding for many years. The Red Guards of the capital are heart-to-heart with the people of the capital and closely connected. The revolutionary masses affectionately call them "our Red Guards," and everyone says, "The armbands of the Red Guards are red, and the hearts of the Red Guards are also red, with every red heart turning towards Chairman Mao."

We visited some Red Guards in Beijing. They told us that as Red Guards, we must first seriously study Chairman Mao's works and arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the great waves of class struggle, only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we truly propagate and defend Mao Zedong Thought, and most powerfully safeguard the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Therefore, the broad masses of Red Guards in Beijing study Chairman Mao's works and the sixteen points every day like hungry and thirsty people. When they go out on missions, they study relevant quotations of Chairman Mao. They said, the Red Guards love Chairman Mao the most, love reading Chairman Mao's books the most, and will forever be Chairman Mao's red soldiers! Dare to struggle, good at struggling, Red Guards grow in struggle.

At the Red Guard combat school (formerly Tsinghua Middle School), we learned about many moving examples of the Red Guards of the capital daring to revolutionize, daring to struggle, being good at revolutionizing, and being good at struggling. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated by Chairman Mao is like a spring thunder that shook Tsinghua Garden, greatly inspiring a group of revolutionary youngsters in Tsinghua Middle School at that time. They rose up to do the revolution with all their might, and without hesitation, they launched a fierce attack on the anti-Party and anti-socialist clique within the school. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, they wrote a big-character poster with deep class feelings, "Long live the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian rebellion!" This revolutionary big-character poster, once posted, was fiercely opposed. However, these youngsters braved the storm and persisted in the struggle. They said, we are the revolutionary iron brooms, unbreakable and unshakable. Therefore, they continued to write "A Further Discussion" and "A Third Discussion," vigorously propagating the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian rebellion, and loudly calling out, "Red Guard warriors, since we have already started the rebellion, let's rebel to the end! Let's go forward and let the revolutionary storm be even more fierce!" Their daring to rebel and tenacious fighting spirit finally inspired and encouraged all other revolutionary teachers and students in the school to unite and struggle together. Recently, the Red Guard youngsters of this school, through studying Chairman Mao's works and the sixteen points, summarized the experience of the previous stage of struggle, and collectively wrote a big-character poster, making a relatively profound analysis of the current situation of the Cultural Revolution. They emphasized, "The sixteen points are the highest directive of Chairman Mao at present, and are the policy of the Party. We Red Guard warriors must strive to study, faithfully execute, enthusiastically propagate, and bravely defend the sixteen points." They also pointed out, "We must use cultural struggle, not physical struggle." They said, "We Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and resolutely execute the sixteen points. We have the ability to politically and ideologically overthrow, smash, and expose all anti-Party and anti-socialist cliques. We will not beat people, and even if the rightists who are anti-Party and anti-socialist do not take violent action, we will not beat them." They repeatedly propagated the principle that "physical struggle can only affect the skin, while cultural struggle can affect the soul." When visiting the Red Guards of this school, we deeply felt that they were being tempered and growing in the great waves of class struggle.

August 31, in the afternoon, this is the most unforgettable happy moment in our lives. On Tiananmen Square, we saw our most beloved and respected leader Chairman Mao. Originally, we were to leave Beijing and return to Shanghai that noon, but we heard that the central leaders would receive us, and everyone was so excited that they did not even have time to eat lunch and waited at Tiananmen Square for the arrival of the leaders. At 5:40 PM, the great commander came, Chairman Mao came, and the entire square of fifty million Red Guards and revolutionary students immediately boiled over, with fifty million people shouting in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years live!" Fifty million red hearts were beating violently, and every red heart flew towards the eternal red sun! Our hands were numb from clapping, and our throats were hoarse from shouting, but we still could not stop clapping and shouting. Excitement, happiness, we finally saw Chairman Mao, finally stood by Chairman Mao's side, our bodies were filled with immense strength, and our emotions surged like a tide. Chairman Mao, you led our fathers and brothers to fight south and north, sweeping across ten thousand miles, and established New China. Now, you are leading the people of the entire country to carry out a magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sweeping away all harmful insects, removing all obstacles, and uprooting all the roots of revisionism. We are the revolutionary successors, your red guards. Wherever you point, we will rush there! Fight to defend the Party Central Committee, fight to defend Chairman Mao! We dare to climb mountains of blades, dare to plunge into seas of fire, and vow to forge an iron proletarian state with our youth and blood! Bring back the revolutionary spark, beat the revolutionary drum louder

In this most happy moment, we saw the great Chairman Mao and heard the warm words of Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai. The magnificent voice inspired us with greater fighting spirit, and Chairman Mao encouraged us to bravely and resolutely join the struggle. Our excited hearts could not calm down, and as soon as the meeting on Tiananmen Square ended, we rushed to the train station and hurried back to Shanghai by night. We brought back the revolutionary spark and are determined to let the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution burn even more fiercely in our school; let the revolutionary drum beat even louder in our school! We are also determined to temper and test ourselves in the flames of this great revolution, forever be Chairman Mao's red guards, and be the strong successors of the proletariat!

    从毛主席身边归来
    上海第一医学院红卫兵　刘开评　徐芬芳　忻绛子　庄月娥　廖静
    八月下旬，我们怀着万分激动的心情，奔赴伟大的首都、无产阶级革命的中心——北京。在那里，我们幸福地见到了最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，看到了日夜盼望的最红最红的太阳。在那里，我们访问了英雄的首都红卫兵，进行了革命串连活动。现在，每当回想起这些难忘的日子，我们总是热血沸腾，久久不能平静。毛主席啊，我们来到了您的身边
    我们是八月二十三日离沪赴京的。当时，我们刚刚成立红卫兵战斗组织，一个个有着火热的红心，战斗的虎劲，誓死做党中央、毛主席的忠实卫兵。为了使自己一开始就沿着毛主席指引的大道勇猛战斗，我们渴望着去北京，去直接聆听毛主席的伟大号召，去看一看毛主席身边的红卫兵们究竟怎样战斗，如何革命。所以，当我们登上赴京的列车时，何等激动，何等兴奋，千思万想归一心：飞向北京！
    列车越过长江，跨过黄河，来到了光辉灿烂的北京城。我们走下列车，一踏上毛主席居住的地方，心头就感到暖呼呼的，无数激动的语言涌向嘴边。我们马上跑到车站邮电局，向上海的本校同学发电报。此时此刻，再多的语言也说不完内心的激动，再长的电文也写不尽共同的兴奋。于是，我们拍了这样的一份电报：“五人到京。毛主席万岁！”毛主席啊毛主席，我们这些小兵已来到您的身边，我们从心底里欢呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”北京正在形成为毛泽东思想的大学校
    北京，这个无产阶级文化大革命的策源地，红旗如海，欢声如潮，到处一片热气腾腾的革命景象，到处闪耀着毛泽东思想的金光。在火车站里，我们就看到贴满着毛主席语录和革命的传单。连车站的地下通道里，也是如此。北京的广大革命人民，对伟大领袖毛主席真是无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜。我们乘上公共汽车，只见车上庄严地挂着毛主席像，贴着毛主席语录。革命学生还带领大家一起认真诵读毛主席语录，纵情歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》。我们所到之处，不论大街小巷，各条胡同，都可以看到毛主席语录牌。在首都人民的交谈中，往往离不了“毛主席他老人家这样说……”。这些感动人心的事例，使我们深深体会到，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，已铭刻在首都人民的心中。毛主席的话，就是行动的准则，力量的源泉。整个北京市正在形成为毛泽东思想的大学校。我们能到这样的革命大学校里学习，感到无上的光荣和幸福。首都红卫兵最最热爱毛主席他们和首都人民心连心
    在光辉伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下创立的首都红卫兵，真不愧为无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋，为党和人民立下了巨大的功勋。这批革命小将们，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢想、敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反，在横扫一切牛鬼蛇神的斗争中冲锋陷阵，在破旧立新的革命中所向披靡。他们纪律严明，善于斗争，密切联系群众，认真按照毛主席亲自制定的十六条办事。因此，他们在北京人民的心中享有很高的威信。我们在北京街道上看到，每当一队红卫兵整齐地走过时，革命群众总是怀着崇敬的眼光向他们致意，并且热烈赞扬他们的功绩。许多单位的职工群众，同红卫兵一起，把一批隐藏多年的寄生虫、吸血鬼揪了出来。首都红卫兵与首都人民心贴心，紧相连。革命群众亲热地把他们称为“我们的红卫兵”，大家都说：“红卫兵的袖章是红的，红卫兵的心也是红的，颗颗红心向着毛主席。”
    我们曾访问过北京一些红卫兵。他们告诉我们，作为红卫兵，首先要认真学习毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，只有掌握了毛泽东思想，才能真正地宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，才能最有力地保卫党中央，保卫毛主席。因此，北京的广大红卫兵每天如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，学习十六条。在外出执行任务时，就学习毛主席的有关语录。他们说，红卫兵最最热爱毛主席，最最爱读毛主席的书，永远做毛主席的红色小兵！敢于斗争，善于斗争红卫兵在斗争中锻炼成长
    在红卫兵战校（原清华附中），我们了解到首都红卫兵敢于革命、敢于斗争，善于革命、善于斗争的许多感人事例。毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命，犹如一声春雷激荡着清华园，大大振奋了当时清华附中的一批革命小将。他们起来大干特干革命，毫不迟疑地向校内的反党反社会主义黑帮猛烈开火。他们根据毛主席的教导，满怀着深厚的阶级感情，写了《无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁！》的大字报。这张革命大字报贴出后，却受到疯狂反对。但是这批小将们顶住风浪，坚持斗争。他们说，我们是革命的铁扫帚，打不烂，冲不垮。因此他们又连续写了“再论”“三论”，大力宣传无产阶级的革命造反精神，大声疾呼：“红卫兵的战士们，我们既然已经把反造起来了，那么就一反到底吧！迎上前去，让革命的大风暴来得更猛烈些吧！”他们的敢于造反，顽强战斗的革命精神，终于启发和鼓舞了全校其他革命师生，团结起来，共同斗争。最近，这个学校的红卫兵小将们，又通过学习毛主席著作，学习十六条，总结了前一阶段的斗争经验，集体写了一张大字报，对目前文化大革命的形势作了比较深刻的分析。他们着重指出，“十六条就是当前毛主席的最高指示，就是党的政策。我们红卫兵战士必须努力学习、忠实执行、热情宣传、勇敢捍卫十六条。”他们还指出“要用文斗，不用武斗”，他们说：“我们红卫兵最听毛主席的话，最坚决地执行十六条，我们完全有能力在政治上、思想上把一切反党反社会主义的黑帮斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，我们决不打人，就是反党反社会主义的右派，只要他不动手行凶，也不要打。”他们反复宣传“武斗只能触及皮肉，文斗才能触其灵魂”的道理。在访问这个学校的红卫兵时，我们深深感到，他们正在阶级斗争的大风大浪中得到锻炼，不断成长。最最难忘的幸福时刻
    八月三十一日下午，这是我们一生中最最难忘的幸福时刻。在天安门广场，我们看见了最最敬爱的领袖毛主席。本来，那天中午我们要离京返沪了，但是听说中央首长要接见我们，大家兴奋得午饭都顾不上吃，到天安门广场等候首长的来临。下午五点四十分，伟大的统帅来了，毛主席来了，全广场五十万红卫兵和革命师生顿时沸腾起来，五十万人齐声欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”五十万颗红心都在激烈地跳跃，颗颗红心飞向永远不落的红太阳！我们的手拍麻了还是不停地鼓掌，我们的喉咙喊哑了还是不停地欢呼。激动呵，幸福呵，我们终于看到毛主席了，终于站到了毛主席的身边，我们浑身充满了巨大的力量，感情像海潮那样奔腾。毛主席，您带领我们的父兄，南征北战，横扫万里，创立了新中国。现在，您又带领全国人民，开展轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，扫除一切害人虫，搬掉一切绊脚石，挖除一切产生修正主义的根子。我们是革命的下一代，是您的红色卫兵，您老人家指向那里，我们就奔向那里！为保卫党中央而战，为保卫毛主席而战！刀山敢上，火海敢闯，誓以青春和热血铸造无产阶级铁打的江山！把革命的火种带回来把革命的战鼓擂得更响
    我们在这个最最幸福的时刻里，见到了伟大的毛主席，听到了林彪同志、周恩来同志的亲切讲话。雄伟的声音激励了我们更大的斗志，毛主席鼓舞我们更勇敢更坚决地投入斗争。我们激动的心怎么也无法平静，当天安门广场的大会刚刚结束，我们就奔赴火车站，星夜赶回上海。我们带回革命的火种，决心让无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，在本校点燃得更加旺盛；把革命的战鼓在本校擂得更响！我们也决心在这场大革命的烈火中经受锻炼和考验，永远当毛主席的红色卫兵，做无产阶级的坚强接班人！
