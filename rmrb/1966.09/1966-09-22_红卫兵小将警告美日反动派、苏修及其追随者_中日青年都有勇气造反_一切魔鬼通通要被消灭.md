Red Guards Warn the U.S. and Japanese Reactionaries, Soviet Revisionists, and Their Followers
Chinese and Japanese Youth Have the Courage to Rebel; All Devils Will Be Annihilated

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, the Red Guards in the capital and various parts of the country are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Japanese youth for the second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally. They expressed great indignation over the Japanese Sato government's unreasonable refusal to issue visas to Japanese youth coming to China. They warned the Sato government: "Your actions to obstruct and sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship will only backfire and you will not have a good end."

The Red Guards in the capital unanimously expressed their firm support for the active struggle of Japanese friends against the Sato government's unreasonable decision. They also stated that they would do an excellent job of preparing for the rally and welcome Japanese friends at any time. The Red Guards from the Central Academy of Drama and the Central Conservatory of Music said that the Sato government's deliberate sabotage of Sino-Japanese youth unity and friendship is completely against the interests of the Japanese people and will not pass in the face of the broad masses of the Japanese people and youth. This will only provoke stronger resistance and larger-scale struggles from the Japanese people and youth.

The Red Guards from Beijing Institute of Chemical Technology and Beijing Institute of Mining said, "We will follow the teachings of Chairman Mao: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' We will definitely support the struggle of Japanese youth more resolutely and thoroughly smash the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionists, and their followers to sabotage Sino-Japanese friendship."

The Red Guards from Hunan Provincial First Normal School, the alma mater of our great leader Chairman Mao, like all the people of the country, are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Japanese youth. They wrote a passionate letter to their Japanese friends who are in the midst of struggle, saying, "Chairman Mao said: 'The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride on its head for long.' Dear Japanese friends will come to our country as messengers of such a great nation to deepen the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. American imperialism and its accomplices are very afraid and are using every means to sabotage. However, the peoples and youth of China and Japan are fearless, and all their conspiracies will be exposed and smashed. Let American imperialism and all reactionaries be terrified in the face of our friendship and unity!"

The Red Guards in Shanghai praised the Japanese youth who are gathering in Tokyo to decisively struggle against the obstacles set by the Sato government. The Red Guards from Shanghai Dance School said, "Japanese youth are decisively struggling against American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. We, as the little red soldiers of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, salute the Japanese youth in struggle and are ready to welcome our comrades at any time." The Red Guards from Nanjing Girls' Fourth Middle School said, "We, on the banks of the Yangtze River, welcome Japanese youth friends with both hands."

The Red Guards from Wuhan University said, "The second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally will further strengthen and develop the combat unity of the peoples and youth of the two countries against the common enemy, American imperialism. It is inevitable that the reactionary Sato government will sabotage this rally. As long as Japanese youth unite and struggle tenaciously, we are fully confident that they will definitely achieve victory." The Red Guards in Guangzhou also expressed their belief that Japanese youth will display their spirit of daring to struggle, break through all obstacles, and realize their wish to come to China.

Two Red Guards from Zhejiang University specially wrote an article to welcome this Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally. They wrote with revolutionary passion: "The youth of China and Japan demand eternal friendship, opposing the common enemy, American imperialism. This is the common wish of the peoples and youth of our two countries. Chairman Mao told us: 'All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! All the peoples of the world must have courage, dare to fight, not fear difficulties, press on wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All devils will be annihilated.' Let us, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, further struggle to enhance our combat friendship and jointly launch a new high tide of anti-U.S. struggle!"

The youth of China and Japan must push the combat friendship established in the common struggle against American imperialism to new heights. This is the Red Guards in Beijing drawing propaganda posters for the rally. (Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter)

    红卫兵小将警告美日反动派、苏修及其追随者
    中日青年都有勇气造反  一切魔鬼通通要被消灭
    据新华社二十一日讯　正在热烈地期待着日本青年前来参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢的首都和全国各地的红卫兵小将们，对日本佐藤政府拒绝发给日本青年来华护照的无理行为表示极大的愤慨。他们警告佐藤政府：“你们阻挠和破坏中日人民友好的行为只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚，是绝不会有好下场的。”
    首都的红卫兵们一致表示最坚决地支持日本朋友为反对佐藤政府的无理决定而展开的积极斗争，并且表示要把大联欢的准备工作做得好上加好，随时欢迎日本朋友的到来。中央戏剧学院、中央音乐学院的红卫兵说，日本佐藤政府蓄意破坏中日青年的团结和友谊，是完全违背日本人民的利益的，在日本广大人民和青年的面前是通不过的，这只能激起日本人民和青年更加强烈的反抗和更大规模的斗争。
    北京化工学院、北京矿业学院的红卫兵表示，我们将遵循毛主席的教导，“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们一定更加坚决地支持日本青年的斗争，彻底粉碎美日反动派、苏联现代修正主义者及其追随者合伙破坏中日人民友好的阴谋。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席的母校——湖南省第一师范学校的红卫兵战士，和全国人民一样，正在热切地盼望着日本青年的到来。他们给正在进行斗争的日本朋友写了一封热情洋溢的信，信上说，毛主席说过：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”亲爱的日本朋友们将作为这样一个伟大民族的使者来到我国，为加深中日人民的友谊作出贡献，美帝国主义及其帮凶们非常害怕，千方百计地耍用各种手段来破坏。但是，中日两国人民和青年是无所畏惧的，它们的一切阴谋都会被中日两国人民和青年揭穿粉碎。让美帝国主义和一切反动派在我们友好团结面前丧魂落魄吧！
    上海市的红卫兵小将们，热烈赞扬日本青年正在汇集东京，为彻底冲破佐藤政府设置的障碍而坚决斗争。上海市舞蹈学校的红卫兵说，日本青年坚决斗争，造美帝国主义的反，造日本反动派的反，我们以最高统帅毛主席的红小兵的身份，向斗争中的日本青年致以战士的敬礼，并且随时准备迎接战友们的到来。南京女四中的红卫兵说，我们在长江之滨，举双手热烈欢迎日本青年朋友们。
    武汉大学的红卫兵代表说，第二届中日青年友好大联欢，将促进中日两国人民和青年反对共同敌人美帝国主义的战斗团结更加巩固和发展，反动的佐藤政府破坏这次大联欢是必然的。日本青年只要团结起来进行艰巨的斗争，我们完全相信一定能够取得胜利。广州市红卫兵小将们也表示坚信，日本青年会发挥他们敢于斗争的精神，冲破重重障碍，实现他们到中国来的愿望。
    杭州大学的两位红卫兵专门为迎接这一届中日青年友好大联欢写了一篇文章，他们满怀革命激情地写道：中日两国青年要求世世代代友好下去，反对共同敌人美帝国主义，这是我们两国人民和青年的共同愿望。毛主席告诉我们：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”让我们在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，进一步为增进我们的战斗友谊，共同掀起反美斗争的新高潮而斗争吧！（附图片）
    中日两国青年一定要把在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊推向新的高峰。这是北京的红卫兵们在为大联欢绘制宣传画。新华社记者摄
