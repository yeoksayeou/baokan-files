Revolutionary people around the world warmly hail China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They point out that this great revolution, guided by the great thought of Mao Zedong, has not only great significance for China but also for the whole world.

The editorial board of Albania's "People's Voice" newspaper stated, "One of the main and most important characteristics of China's socialist cultural revolution is that it is being carried out under the banner of the great thought of Marxism-Leninism, under the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought." The article pointed out, "The smooth development of the socialist revolution being carried out by the Communist Party of China has extremely important international significance for the destiny of the socialist cause of the whole world."

New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcock, on behalf of the New Zealand Communist Party Central Committee, issued a statement pointing out that the cultural revolution currently underway in China shows the Chinese people's determination not to allow the restoration of capitalism. The statement said that Comrade Mao Zedong's assertion that the socialist revolution must be carried through to the end in the realms of culture and ideology is of great significance.

The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), "Vanguard," published an article praising the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a document of great world-historical significance. It said, "Mao Zedong has made the most outstanding study of all the experiences of the world revolutionary movement. He has pointed out, especially under the current conditions, the intensity of class struggle. Imperialists are constantly trying to restore capitalism. They are trying to break through from within socialism. This is a matter of life and death."

Belgian Communist Party Central Committee member Griba, in a report, pointed out that the socialist cultural revolution being carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao is "a victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and a victory for all revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists in the world."

Myanmar writer Deqin Miaodan said, "The socialist cultural revolution now unfolding in China is a revolution that concerns the entire progressive humanity." He said, "This socialist cultural revolution is important not only for China but also for the whole world." He pointed out, "The people's movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America for liberation, peace, and socialism will gain strength as Chinese socialism is consolidated and the revolutionary dynamics of Chinese socialism are enhanced."

Pakistani writer Shaukat Siddiqui said, "The victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a great victory of the great thought of Mao Zedong. It has struck a heavy blow at all imperialists and modern revisionists who dream that modern revisionism can take root in socialist China."

Zimbabwe African National Union representative in Dar es Salaam, Pasipanodya, said that Chairman Mao's August 18 celebration in Beijing with a million revolutionary masses of the cultural revolution is a great encouragement to all revolutionary people in Asia and Africa and to revolutionary people all over the world. It is a heavy blow to the reactionaries at home and abroad who are plotting to restore capitalism in China.

A friend from Congo (Leopoldville) said, "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese cultural revolution has achieved great victories. This victory is not only a victory for the Chinese people but also a victory for the revolutionary people of the world. This is a great contribution to the national liberation movement of the whole world, a contribution far greater than any material aid."

Mexican China Friendship Association Chairman and renowned women's social activist Estela Chapa said that the socialist cultural revolution currently underway in China is necessary and timely. She said, "Imperialists and revisionists are poisoning people's minds every moment. If this is not resolutely resisted and eliminated, socialism will retreat and capitalism will be restored."

    各国革命人民热烈欢呼：
    中国无产阶级文化大革命有重大国际意义
    新华社三十一日讯　世界各国革命人民热烈欢呼中国的无产阶级文化大革命。他们指出，伟大的毛泽东思想指导的这场大革命，不但对中国而且对全世界都具有重大的意义。
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》编辑部文章说，“中国的社会主义文化大革命的主要和最重要的特点之一是，它是在马克思列宁主义伟大思想的旗帜下，在毛泽东思想的革命旗帜下进行的”。文章指出，“中国共产党所进行的这场社会主义大革命的顺利发展，对于全世界社会主义事业的命运，也具有极其重大的国际意义。”
    新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯以新共全国书记处名义发表声明指出，中国正在进行的文化大革命表明中国人民决不容许资本主义复辟的决心。声明说，毛泽东同志所指出的在文化和意识形态方面，必须把社会主义革命进行到底的论断，是具有极其重大意义的贡献。
    澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》发表文章，赞颂中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定是具有重大世界历史意义的文件。它说，毛泽东最杰出地研究了世界革命运动的所有经验，“他指明了特别是在当前的条件下阶级斗争的激烈性。帝国主义者不断企图使资本主义复辟。他们企图从内部攻破社会主义。这是一个生死问题。”
    比利时共产党中央委员会书记格里巴在一次报告会上指出，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下开展社会主义文化大革命，“这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的胜利，这是全世界革命者和马克思列宁主义者的胜利”。
    缅甸作家德钦妙丹说：“现在在中国展开的社会主义文化大革命是关系到整个进步人类的一场革命”。他说：“这个社会主义文化大革命不但对中国，而且对全世界都是重要的。”他指出：“亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲争取解放、和平和社会主义的人民运动，将随着中国社会主义的巩固和中国社会主义革命动力的增强而增加力量。”
    巴基斯坦作家肖卡特·西迪基说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利是伟大的毛泽东思想的新胜利，它狠狠地打击了幻想现代修正主义能在社会主义中国生根的一切帝国主义者和现代修正主义者。”
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟驻达累斯萨拉姆首席代表帕西帕诺迪亚说，毛主席八月十八日在北京同百万革命群众共庆文化大革命，是对全体亚非革命人民和全世界革命人民的巨大鼓舞，是对中国国内外的反动派企图在中国复辟资本主义阴谋的一个沉重打击。
    刚果（利）的一位朋友说，在毛泽东思想指导下，中国文化大革命取得了伟大胜利，这个胜利不只是中国人民的胜利，也是世界革命人民的胜利。这是对全世界民族解放运动的伟大贡献，这一贡献远远超过任何物质的援助。
    墨西哥中国友好协会主席、著名妇女社会活动家埃斯特尔·查帕说，中国正在进行的社会主义文化大革命是必要的和及时的。她说，帝国主义者和修正主义者每时每刻都企图在思想意识方面放毒，如果不坚决予以抵制，不予以清除，那么社会主义将会倒退，资本主义将会复辟。
