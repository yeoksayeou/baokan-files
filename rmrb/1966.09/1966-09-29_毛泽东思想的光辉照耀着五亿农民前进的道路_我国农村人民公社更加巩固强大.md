The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path forward for five hundred million farmers. The people's communes in our rural areas have become even more consolidated and powerful.

Since 1962, we have had a good harvest every year, and this year we have achieved an even greater and more comprehensive bumper harvest.

New China News Agency, September 28th: Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people's communes in our rural areas are advancing triumphantly on the path of consolidation and development, emitting even more brilliant rays. With its strong vitality, it has played an extremely significant role in developing agricultural production, overcoming natural disasters, and consolidating the socialist front in rural areas. It has established an immortal merit in building a brand-new socialist rural area. The great practice of the people's communes in our rural areas has powerfully refuted the attacks and slanders of all reactionaries at home and abroad.

Following Chairman Mao's reiteration at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee regarding the contradictions, classes, and class struggles in socialist society, rural areas in our country have, over the past few years, taken class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key, and extensively launched the socialist education movement. Hundreds of millions of farmers have greatly enhanced their socialist revolutionary awareness, smashed the advances of capitalist and feudal forces, and resolutely walked the socialist road. They read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, making the people's communes, which integrate agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, and combine industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce, even better. Now, the people's communes throughout the country, compared to the early days of their establishment, compared to the period of the three years of natural disasters and difficulties, and compared to before the socialist education movement, have become more consolidated and powerful in politics, economy, ideology, and organization.

Overcoming the difficulties brought by the three years of natural disasters and rapidly restoring and developing agricultural production have demonstrated the tremendous superiority and vitality of the people's communes. In the years when natural disasters were the heaviest, the people's communes, with their powerful collective strength and with the support of the state and various industries, organized the commune members to successfully overcome the difficulties and protect the productive forces. Subsequently, they rapidly restored agricultural production and took a big step forward. From 1962 to 1966, our country's main agricultural products such as grain, cotton, oil, tobacco, hemp, sugar, tea, and cocoons, as well as large and small livestock and poultry, have had a good harvest every year. This has powerfully promoted the development of the entire national economy, promoted national defense construction, and strengthened the force to support the world revolution.

Over the past few years, the broad masses of commune members and cadres have, following Chairman Mao's teachings, actively participated in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. They have carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, independently transforming nature, building stable and high-yield farmlands, and achieving one success after another. The Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi, the Xia Dingjia Brigade in Shandong, the Shashiyu Brigade in Hebei, and many "Dazhai" brigades across the country, as well as Lin County in Henan, the suburbs of Shanghai, the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Dongting Lake Plain, the Jianghan Plain, and the Honghu area, have all relied on the collective economy of the communes to independently transform nature, achieving or basically achieving stable and high yields. Across the country, the broad masses of people's communes have built a large number of water conservancy and soil conservation projects in countless arid mountainous areas and low-lying waterlogged regions, gradually achieving drought and flood resistance, and significantly improving the production landscape compared to before the establishment of the communes. Many people's communes have also independently built machinery and implemented agricultural mechanization, achieving significant results. Since 1962, some regions in our country still suffer from natural disasters every year. However, the people's communes' ability to overcome disasters has greatly increased. The Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi suffered a devastating flood in 1963 and experienced considerable drought, flood, wind, and hail disasters in the following years and this year. Despite this, the brigade has maintained stable and high yields over these years. Like the Dazhai Brigade, people's communes across the country have, over the past few years, overcome natural disasters with their powerful strength, leading to a new situation of steady agricultural production growth nationwide. This year, agricultural production across the country has further achieved an even greater and more comprehensive bumper harvest.

Over the past few years, while vigorously developing agricultural production, the people's communes in various places have also greatly advanced forestry, animal husbandry, and other rural production sectors. The Jiajiaying Brigade of Wanyuanqing Commune in Fenyang County, Shanxi, the Liuji Commune in Xinzhou County, Hubei, many communes in the suburbs of Shanghai, the Huagang Commune in Nanxian County, Hunan, and many other people's communes across the country have not only seen annual development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations but have also, with self-reliance and state support, established some small factories, accelerating the process of agricultural mechanization. Cultural, educational, health, and scientific endeavors in rural areas have also flourished. Now, commune-run farming and reading schools, evening schools, scientific research organizations, and rural clubs have spread throughout the interior and border regions.

The great socialist education movement, along with the subsequent movement of broad masses of rural cadres and commune members actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, has brought about a complete transformation of the spiritual face of rural areas. Broad masses of commune members, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have discarded old ideas and habits, establishing new ideas and habits of everything for the collective, everything for the people, and everything for the revolution. They no longer farm merely for life and for themselves but instead, with a broad vision of the nation and the world, farm for the revolution and work for the revolution.

The consolidation and development of the people's communes in our country are the victories of hundreds of millions of farmers in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Recently, Chairman Mao issued a great call of epoch-making significance: "The commune farmers should take agriculture (including forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries) as the main focus but also learn military affairs, politics, and culture. When conditions permit, they should also establish some small factories collectively and criticize the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's call has greatly inspired the broad masses of commune members to further consolidate and develop the people's communes. They are determined to hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, turning the people's communes into revolutionary schools, and bravely advancing on the path of socialist revolution and socialist construction, riding the wind and breaking the waves.

Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the people of all ethnic groups in our country have directed their boundless revolutionary enthusiasm towards production, construction, and scientific experimentation.

    毛泽东思想的光辉照耀着五亿农民前进的道路
    我国农村人民公社更加巩固强大
    广大农民在社会主义教育运动中大大提高觉悟，坚定地走社会主义道路。
    一九六二年以来，年年获得好收成，今年又获得更大更全面的丰收。
    新华社二十八日讯　我国农村人民公社在毛泽东思想指引下，在巩固和发展的道路上胜利前进，发出了更加灿烂的光辉。它以其强大的生命力，在发展农业生产，战胜自然灾害，巩固农村社会主义阵地等方面，发挥了极为巨大的作用，对建设一个崭新的社会主义新农村，树立了不朽的功勋。我国农村人民公社的伟大实践，有力地粉碎了国内外一切反动派的攻击和诬蔑。
    遵循毛主席在八届十中全会上再次强调的关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，几年来我国农村以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，广泛地展开了社会主义教育运动，亿万农民大大地提高了社会主义的革命觉悟，粉碎了资本主义和封建势力的进攻，坚定地走社会主义道路。他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，把农林牧副渔并举、工农兵学商结合的农村人民公社越办越好。现在，全国各地的人民公社，比之建社初期，比之三年自然灾害困难时期，比之社会主义教育运动以前，无论在政治上、经济上、思想上和组织上都更加巩固，更加强大。
    克服三年自然灾害带来的困难，迅速地恢复和发展农业生产，显示了人民公社的巨大的优越性和旺盛的生命力。在自然灾害最重的年头，人民公社以其强大的集体力量，在国家和各行各业的支援下，组织社员胜利渡荒，保护了生产力；接着，又迅速地恢复了农业生产，并且向前大大地发展了一步。从一九六二年到一九六六年，我国粮、棉、油、烟、麻、糖、茶、茧等主要农产品和大小家畜、家禽，年年获得好收成，从而有力地促进了整个国民经济的发展，促进了国防建设，增强了支援世界革命的力量。
    几年来，人民公社的广大社员和干部遵照毛主席的教导，积极投入阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动。他们发扬“穷棒子”精神，自力更生地改造自然，建设稳产高产农田，取得一个又一个新的成就。山西的大寨大队、山东的下丁家大队、河北的沙石峪大队和全国各地的许多“大寨”，以及河南林县、上海市郊区、长江三角洲、珠江三角洲、洞庭湖平原、江汉平原和洪湖地区等许多地方，就都是依靠公社集体经济，自力更生地改造自然，从而做到了或基本上做到了稳产高产的。在全国，广大人民公社在无数干旱的山区和低洼易涝地区，兴修了大量的水利工程和水土保持工程，使这些地区逐步做到旱涝保收，生产面貌较公社化前大大改观；还有不少人民公社自力更生办机械，实行农业机械化，获得了重大的成绩。一九六二年以来，我国每年仍有部分地区发生自然灾害。但是，人民公社战胜灾害的力量已经大大加强。山西大寨大队一九六三年遭了毁灭性的洪灾，去年和今年又遭了相当大的旱、洪、风、雹等灾害，这个队这些年却仍然保持了稳产高产。和大寨大队一样，各地人民公社几年来以其强大的力量战胜了自然灾害，使全国的农业生产出现了稳步上升的新局面。今年，全国农业又进一步获得了更大和更全面的丰收。
    几年来，各地人民公社在大力发展农业生产的同时，还把林业、牧业及农村其他生产事业，大大地向前推进了一步。山西汾阳县万年青公社贾家庄大队，湖北新洲县刘集公社，上海市郊区的许多公社，湖南南县华阁公社以及各地很多人民公社，不但农林牧副各业逐年发展，还在自力更生和国家的支援下，办了一些小型工厂，加速了农业机械化的过程。农村的文化、教育、卫生、科学事业等也有了蓬勃的发展。现在，社办耕读学校、业余学校、科学研究组织和农村俱乐部等，已经遍及内地和边疆。
    伟大的社会主义教育运动，和随之而来的广大农村干部和社员活学活用毛主席著作的运动，使整个农村的精神面貌为之一新。广大社员以毛泽东思想为武器，破除旧思想、旧习惯，树立一切为集体、一切为人民、一切为革命的新思想、新习惯。他们种田不再仅仅是为生活，为自己，而是胸怀全国，放眼世界，为革命种田，为革命劳动。
    我国人民公社的巩固和发展，是亿万农民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的胜利。不久前，毛主席发出了具有划时代意义的伟大号召：“公社农民以农为主（包括林、牧、副、渔），也要兼学军事、政治、文化。在有条件的时候，也要由集体办些小工厂，也要批判资产阶级。”毛主席这个号召，极大地鼓舞了广大社员进一步巩固和发展人民公社的积极性。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把人民公社办成革命化的大学校，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的道路上乘风破浪地奋勇前进。（附图片）
