They are the collective Yellow Jinguang, collective Qiu Shaoyun, collective Ouyang Hai, and collective Mai Xiande of the Cultural Revolution. This drilling team is a heroic collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They "imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in their minds, dissolve them in their blood, and implement them in their actions." They regard reading Chairman Mao's books as the first necessity of life, transform Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, and turn the execution of Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious actions, placing revolutionary interests as their first priority.

The People's Daily reports: During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a brilliant collective shining with the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought emerged on China's petroleum front—the 32111 Drilling Team. In the face of a sudden, towering inferno, they used their blood and lives to protect a newly drilled major gas well, creating a miraculous feat that shook the heavens and the earth.

This drilling team is a heroic collective armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They have long persisted in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, regarding the reading of Chairman Mao's books as the first necessity of life, transforming Mao Zedong Thought into their souls, turning the implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions into conscious actions, and placing revolutionary interests as their first priority.

The 32111 Drilling Team enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to the petroleum front workers to find gas and oil. They "imprint Chairman Mao's instructions in their minds, dissolve them in their blood, and implement them in their actions." They braved the wind and rain, seized every minute, and completed three months' work in one month. On a new structure, they drilled the first high-pressure, high-yield natural gas well, making a tremendous contribution to the socialist construction of the motherland.

On the morning of June 22, while this drilling team was performing the final task before production—closing the well for pressure testing—the gas well pressure suddenly surged. A seamless steel pipe at the wellhead burst, and the high-pressure natural gas jet crossed the drilling site, shattering the explosion-proof lamps under the drilling platform. Instantly, a vast fireball rose, forming a sea of flames fifty meters wide and thirty meters high. The entire gas field was in imminent danger of destruction.

At this critical moment, the workers on duty at the drilling site and those rushing from the dormitories charged into battle like warriors, fearlessly fighting the raging fire.

The flames rolled back and forth across the drilling site. The steel drilling rig collapsed in three minutes. The diesel engine melted into lumps of iron. The water sprayed in quickly turned into boiling water. The roar of the gas jet was deafening. The firelight blinded the eyes, making it impossible to see anything.

The firelight was the command. Great Mao Zedong Thought was directing their battle.

Mining area party committee member and deputy commander and chief engineer Zhang Zhongmin, severely injured, told those who came to rescue him, "Don't mind me, quickly close the number three valve."

Ro Huaotai, who was watching the pressure gauge, and Wang Zuming, who was guarding the number two valve, were both engulfed in flames but remained at their posts until they stopped breathing.

Deputy political instructor Lei Hongbin, overcome by toxic fumes, thought of the need for cadres to lead in times of life and death, and charged into the inferno four times.

Deputy driller and Young Communist League member Wang Youfa attempted to smother the burning wellhead with a wet blanket three times, but failed. Remembering the great leader's teaching: "To conquer all enemies and never be subdued by them," he wrapped the wet blanket around himself and shouted, "Burn me! Burn me!" He charged towards the wellhead with the blanket, covering both himself and the blanket.

Apprentice worker Xu Guangyi collapsed in a ditch, but he seemed to hear Chairman Mao's warm voice: "Little comrade, little comrade, charge on!" He stood up again, bravely charging into the inferno and grabbing the water hose to protect his comrades in front.

After thirty minutes of life-and-death struggle, the heroes finally extinguished the towering inferno, saving the newly drilled major gas well.

This is another triumphant march of great Mao Zedong Thought resounding through the clouds!

In this battle, Zhang Yongqing, Wang Ping, Wu Zhongqi, Deng Miquan, and three other comrades sacrificed their lives, and twenty-one comrades were honorably wounded.

These heroes have established immortal merits for the motherland and the people. They are truly the collective Yellow Jinguang, collective Qiu Shaoyun, collective Ouyang Hai, and collective Mai Xiande.

During the bloody battle against the inferno, the comrades from the mining area's labor team, the families of the drilling team, and the nearby commune members also bravely participated in the firefighting.

The Party and Chairman Mao showed immense care for the heroic fighters. Within twenty-four hours, 130 medical personnel from twenty-two units across the country, equipped with the best medicines and medical equipment, traversed mountains and valleys to reach the scene. The local populace also rushed to the hospital, eager to donate their blood to their class brothers. Within a few days, over 70,000 commune members rushed to pay their respects to the martyrs and comfort the wounded. Within a month, over 35,000 condolence letters and many gifts were sent from all over the country.

The heroes always felt Chairman Mao by their side. It was great Mao Zedong Thought that gave them boundless spiritual strength to fight against the pain.

Diesel engine driver Ruan Shurong was severely burned and went into shock several times. In his delirium, he kept shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" He regarded eating, taking medicine, and treatment as Chairman Mao's care and tasks for him. He overcame unimaginable physical pain and lay face down in bed for over forty days and nights.

Severely injured Zhang Zhongmin, on his first day in the hospital, just woke up and asked for the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Later, he had the nurses deliver quotation boards to every ward. When the doctor operated on him, he kept repeating, "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He did not utter a sound during the operation.

While fighting against the pain, the wounded often shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang "The East Is Red." It was this tenacious revolutionary optimism that, under the meticulous care of medical personnel, allowed the severely wounded to survive the critical period and the lightly wounded to recover their health in just over a month.

The heroic deeds of the 32111 team quickly spread across the petroleum front and many cities and villages. Millions of people, inspired by the heroes' feats, unanimously declared: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn from the heroes' examples, follow the heroes' path, and create heroes' achievements.

The firelight was the command. The heroes of the 32111 Drilling Team, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dared to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire.

    伟大毛泽东思想的又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌
    32111英雄钻井队扑灭火海保住大气井
    他们是文化大革命中涌现的集体的黄继光、集体的邱少云、集体的欧阳海、集体的麦贤得
    这个钻井队是用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄集体。他们“把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”他们把读毛主席的书看作生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动，把革命利益当成第一生命。
    本报讯　在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国石油战线上出现了一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的英雄集体——32111钻井队。他们在一场冲天大火的突然袭击下，用鲜血和生命保住了一个新开的大气井，创造了惊天动地的英雄奇迹。
    这个钻井队，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄集体。他们长期坚持活学活用毛主席著作，把读毛主席的书作为生活的第一需要，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，把贯彻执行毛主席的指示变成自觉的行动，把革命利益当成第一生命。
    32111钻井队热烈响应毛主席向石油战线职工发出的找气、找油的伟大号召。他们“把毛主席的指示印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在行动上。”他们餐风宿野，争分夺秒，一个月干了三个月的工作，在一个新构造上，打出了第一口产量大、压力高的天然气井，为祖国社会主义建设作出了巨大贡献。
    六月二十二日凌晨一时，这个钻井队正在进行投入生产前的最后一项工作——关井测压的时候，由于气井压力急骤上升，井口出气的一根无缝钢管，突然憋破。爆破口喷出的高压天然气流，横穿井场，冲破了钻台底下的防爆灯泡，顿时熊熊大火腾空而起，形成宽广五十多米、高三十多米的一片火海。整个大气田面临着毁灭的危险。
    在这万分紧急的关头，正在井场值班和从宿舍赶来的职工们，像投入战斗一样，奋不顾身地同烈火搏斗。
    烈火在井场来回翻滚。钢铁井架三分钟就被烧倒了。柴油机也被熔成了铁砣砣。喷射进去的水，很快就变成沸汤。喷气声震耳欲聋。火光刺得眼睛什么也看不清。
    火光就是命令。伟大的毛泽东思想在指挥他们战斗。
    正在现场工作的矿区党委委员、副指挥兼总工程师张仲珉，身负重伤，对前去救他的同志说：“莫要管我，快关三号闸门。”
    看守压力表的罗华太、看守二号闸门的王祖明，满身大火，仍然坚守岗位，直到停止呼吸。
    副指导员雷洪炳，被毒气熏倒，他想到干部最需要在生死关头带头，先后四次冲进火海。
    副司钻、共青团员王有发，三次用湿棉被去盖着火的井口，都没有成功，他想到伟大领袖的教导：“要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”，就把湿被子往身上一裹，大声喊着：你烧吧！你烧吧！连人带被子，向火口堵去。
    学徒工徐光益昏倒在水沟里的时候，耳边仿佛响着毛主席的亲切声音：小鬼，小鬼，你冲呀！他又坚强地站了起来，冲进火海，拿起水龙带掩护前面的同志。
    经过三十分钟的生死搏斗，英雄们终于扑灭了这场冲天大火，保住了这个新开的大气井。
    这是伟大的毛泽东思想的又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌！
    在这场战斗中，张永庆、王平、吴仲启、邓木全等六位同志壮烈牺牲，有二十一位同志光荣负伤。
    这些英雄们，为祖国、为人民建立了不朽的功勋。他们不愧是集体的黄继光、集体的邱少云、集体的欧阳海、集体的麦贤得……。
    在血战火海的斗争中，矿区民工团的同志、钻井队的家属和附近的公社社员，也英勇参加了灭火的战斗。
    党和毛主席对参战的英雄们给予了无微不至的关怀。在二十四小时内，从各地二十二个单位派出了一百三十多名医护人员，带上最好的药物和医疗器械，翻山越岭，赶赴现场。当地人民群众也纷纷赶到医院，争先恐后地要求把自己的鲜血，献给阶级弟兄。几天之内，有七万多名人民公社社员赶去吊唁烈士，慰问伤员。一个多月内，全国各地寄去了三万五千多封慰问信和很多慰问品。
    英雄们时时感到毛主席在他们身边。是伟大的毛泽东思想，给了他们同伤疼搏斗的无穷精神力量。
    柴油机司机冉树荣，烧伤很重，几次休克。他在昏迷中不断地喊：“毛主席万岁！”他把吃饭、吃药、治伤……，都看成是毛主席对他的关怀，给他的任务。他克服了难以想像的肉体痛苦，在床上俯卧了四十多个昼夜。
    伤势严重的张仲珉，到医院的第一天，刚刚苏醒过来，就要《毛主席语录》。以后，又让护士给每个病房送去语录牌。当医生给他作手术的时候，他不停地默念着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在手术过程中，始终不哼一声。
    伤员们在同伤疼作斗争的时候，经常高呼：“毛主席万岁！”高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。正是依靠这种顽强的革命乐观主义精神，在医护人员的精心治疗和护理下，一个多月时间，重伤员都脱离了危险期，轻伤员都恢复了健康。
    32111队的英雄奇迹，很快传遍了石油战线和许多城市、乡村。千百万群众在英雄事迹的鼓舞下，异口同声地表示：要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，学英雄的榜样，走英雄的道路，创英雄的业绩。（附图片）
    火光就是命令。用毛泽东思想武装起来的32111钻井队的英雄们，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。              　董辰生作
