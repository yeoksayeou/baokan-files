Chairman Mao Forever in Our Hearts

Meng Yongkui, a poor peasant from Beixiaoguan Brigade, Dongsheng Commune, Beijing

On August 18th, I participated in the meeting at Tiananmen Square where Chairman Mao received the million-strong Cultural Revolution army. This time, from the movie, I saw Chairman Mao again, and my heart was filled with indescribable joy. Chairman Mao is so healthy, and he walks with such vigor. This is truly our greatest happiness.

We workers, peasants, and Red Guards love Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao also loves us workers, peasants, and Red Guards. Chairman Mao has come among the masses several times, shaking hands with everyone and taking photos. On Tiananmen, he walked from one end to the other, waving his military cap high, smiling at us, and not putting it down for a long time.

All the revolutionary people of China and the world love Chairman Mao because he is the helmsman of the Chinese people and the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people. Chairman Mao is always with all the revolutionary people of China and the world, forever together.

This Cultural Revolution is personally led by Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao personally received us, the million-strong revolutionary masses. This is a great encouragement to us. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, study Chairman Mao's works diligently, study the Sixteen Points diligently, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end. I will definitely smash all the monsters and demons, and carry out the movement to destroy the "Four Olds" and establish the "Four News" to the end.

While we are doing a good job in the Cultural Revolution, we must also do a good job in production, achieving both revolution and production. We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely use our actions to respond to Chairman Mao's concern for us.

I suggest that this film should be shown more widely across the country, in cities, and especially in rural areas, so that all of us poor and lower-middle peasants can see this film. We poor and lower-middle peasants all want to see Chairman Mao!

    毛主席永远和我们心连心
    北京市东升公社北下关大队贫农社员　孟永奎
    八月十八日，我参加了天安门毛主席接见百万文化革命大军大会。这次，从电影上，我又一次看见了毛主席，心里真是说不出来的高兴。毛主席身体那么健康，走路那么有劲，这真是我们最大的幸福。
    我们工农兵、红卫兵热爱毛主席，毛主席也热爱我们工农兵和红卫兵。毛主席几次走到群众中来，和大家握手，照像。在天安门上，他老人家从这头走到那头，从那头走到这头，向我们微笑着，用手高举着他的军帽，向我们挥动着，好久也不放下来。
    我们全中国革命人民、全世界革命人民都热爱毛主席，因为他老人家是中国人民的舵手，是世界革命人民心里的红太阳。毛主席和全中国人民和全世界所有革命人民时刻在一起，永远在一起。
    这场文化大革命，是毛主席亲自领导的，毛主席又亲自接见我们百万革命群众，这对我们是一个极大的鼓舞。我一定要好好听毛主席的话，努力学习毛主席著作，努力学习十六条，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。一定要打垮一切牛鬼蛇神，一定要把破“四旧”，立“四新”的运动搞到底。
    我们在搞好文化大革命的同时，也要搞好生产，做到抓革命，促生产，革命生产两不误。我们贫下中农一定要用实际行动来回答毛主席对我们的关怀。
    我建议这个片子要在全国各地多多上映，要在城市映，更要到农村去映，最好让我们贫下中农都能看上这部片子。我们贫下中农都想见毛主席的呵！
