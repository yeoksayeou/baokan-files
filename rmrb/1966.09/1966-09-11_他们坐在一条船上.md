The saying goes: birds of a feather flock together. The right-wing military regime in Indonesia is brutally suppressing the Indonesian revolutionary people and fiercely anti-China, while at the same time cozying up to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries. This further exposes its true nature.

The right-wing military regime in Indonesia is facing significant difficulties both domestically and internationally, making its days very tough. To maintain its brutal rule, it is trading Indonesia's national interests for "aid" from imperialism. It has signed an agreement with the Dutch colonial authorities to "strengthen economic and cultural ties between the two countries," effectively nullifying the struggle of the Indonesian people for national independence since 1945 and allowing Dutch colonial forces to return to Indonesia. Recently, the right-wing military leader Suharto openly begged for economic and military "aid" from the American imperialist, the sworn enemy of the Indonesian people, during a conversation with a reporter from the American magazine *Newsweek*. The right-wing military regime is also closely aligned with the Soviet revisionist leadership, with frequent exchanges. The right-wing military clique received a large number of modern Soviet weapons during its seizure of power and massacre of the people. Recently, the foreign minister of this reactionary regime, Malik, is preparing to visit the Soviet Union to discuss further collaboration. Meanwhile, the right-wing military regime has, in accordance with the wishes of American imperialism, canceled its opposition to the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia" and is now on friendly terms with the Rahman regime. It is also colluding with the Indian reactionaries, attempting to serve the American imperialist's plot for "peace talks" in Vietnam.

All of this shows that the right-wing military regime in Indonesia is in the same boat with American-led imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, and reactionaries from various countries.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao, when discussing the big landlords, big evil gentry, big warlords, big officials, and big compradors in China—these running dogs of imperialism—pointed out, "They have formed a traitorous camp. In front of them, there is no question of being or not being a traitor to the nation. They have removed the national boundary lines; their interests are inseparable from those of imperialism." Chairman Mao's extremely penetrating analysis of the Chinese reactionaries made more than twenty years ago is equally incisive in exposing the true nature of today's Indonesian right-wing military regime.

    他们坐在一条船上
    俗语说得好：物以类聚，人以群分。印度尼西亚右派军人政权血腥镇压印度尼西亚革命人民，拚命反华，同时却同帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派搞得火热。这就更加说明了它究竟是个什么货色。
    印度尼西亚右派军人政权在国内外都遇到了很大的困难，日子难过得很。为了维持自己的残暴统治，它正在用印度尼西亚的民族利益去换取帝国主义的“援助”。它同荷兰殖民当局签订了一个“密切两国经济和文化关系”的协定，把印度尼西亚人民从一九四五年以来争取和维护民族独立的斗争一笔勾销，让荷兰殖民主义势力重新回到印度尼西亚。右派军人头子苏哈托最近在同美国《新闻周刊》记者谈话中，还公开乞求印度尼西亚人民的死敌美帝国主义给予经济和军事“援助”。印度尼西亚右派军人政权同苏联修正主义领导集团也是勾勾搭搭，过往甚密。右派军人集团在篡夺政权和屠杀人民的过程中，得到了大量的苏联现代化武器。最近这个反动政权的外交部长马利克正准备访问苏联，商谈双方进一步勾结的问题。同时，右派军人政权已经按照美帝国主义的意旨，取消了对新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”的对抗，同拉赫曼政权握手言欢。它还同印度反动派互相勾结，企图替美帝侵略越南的“和谈”阴谋效劳。
    这一切说明，印度尼西亚右派军人政权同以美国为首的帝国主义、苏联修正主义领导集团和各国反动派坐的是一条船。
    在抗日战争时期，毛主席谈到中国大土豪、大劣绅、大军阀、大官僚、大买办这些帝国主义在中国的走狗时，曾经指出，“他们组成了一个卖国贼营垒，在他们面前没有什么当不当亡国奴的问题，他们已经撤去了民族的界线，他们的利益同帝国主义的利益是不可分离的”。毛主席二十多年前对中国反动派所作的这个极其精辟的分析，对于今天印度尼西亚右派军人政权，同样是一针见血地揭示了他们的本质。
