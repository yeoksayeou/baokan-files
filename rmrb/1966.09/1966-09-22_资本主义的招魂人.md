Edition: 6

The counter-revolutionary revisionist and capitalist-roader in power within the Party, Lin Mohan, during the period of temporary economic difficulties in our country, frenziedly attacked the people's communes, attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attacked our great Party.

In October 1961, Lin Mohan in Fujian vigorously advocated the opening of "free markets," shouting, "Only by opening free markets can we restore the economy and overcome difficulties." In July 1962, Lin Mohan at a meeting strongly advocated individual farming, saying, "The economy has moved too fast in the past few years," "Farmers have lost confidence in the collective." He slandered farmers, saying, "Digging ten hoes of land, eight hoes are for others, what motivation is there?" He claimed that the people's communes were "established too early," and even shamelessly said, "Khrushchev said that cadres lack knowledge to manage large-scale production, which makes sense."

In addition to advocating individual farming in agriculture, Lin Mohan also promoted "private ownership" in culture. In July 1962, at the national meeting of cultural bureau directors, he said, "Private radio stations can also be established," and proposed learning from Soviet revisionism to have "private doctors" and "private troupes," etc., attempting to restore capitalism from the economic base to the superstructure!

Lin Mohan slandered our proletarian dictatorship as "undemocratic," saying, "The path is getting narrower and narrower." On June 29, 1961, at a film creation meeting, he spread rumors, saying, "Someone at the Commercial Press said, it's undemocratic, Qin Shi Huang's dynasty lasted only fourteen years!" Listen, how much hatred Lin Mohan and his ilk have for the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system! We know that in today's socialist society, who would feel undemocratic? Only those who persist in reactionary positions, the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists! Lin Mohan is what kind of person, and what position he stands for, is it not clear?

Lin Mohan comes from a reactionary landlord family, and for a long time, his landlord class position has not been reformed. After liberation, he once brought his landlord mother to Beijing to evade public supervision. In 1965, a relevant unit sent him a document about enrollment work, and this landlord saw in the document that priority should be given to enrolling children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. He flew into a rage in the middle of the night and called the person in charge, demanding, "What is your background? I, Lin Mohan, am from a landlord family." Lin Mohan, this thorough landlord class son and grandson, is so brazenly maintaining his reactionary position. We must thoroughly expose his reactionary face and overthrow, smash, and expose this small clique of capitalist-roaders in power!

    资本主义的招魂人
    反革命修正主义分子、党内走资本主义道路的当权派林默涵，在我国三年经济暂时困难时期，疯狂地攻击人民公社，攻击无产阶级专政，攻击我们伟大的党。
    一九六一年十月，林默涵在福建大肆鼓吹开放“自由市场”，叫嚷“只有开放自由市场，才能恢复经济，克服困难。”一九六二年七月，林默涵在一次会上极力鼓吹单干，他说：“过去几年经济上走得太快了”，“农民对集体失去信心”。他污蔑农民说：“挖十锄地，八锄是别人的，还有什么积极性？”他认为人民公社“办早了”，甚至厚颜无耻地说：“赫鲁晓夫说过，干部还没有知识管大生产，这个话有道理。”
    林默涵除了在农业上大刮单干风以外，在文化上也鼓吹“私有制”。一九六二年七月，他在全国文化局长会议的组长汇报会上说：“私人办广播电台也可以”，还提出要向苏联修正主义学习，搞“私人医生”，办“私人剧团”等等，企图从经济基础到上层建筑，全面地、彻底地复辟资本主义！
    林默涵污蔑我们无产阶级专政的社会“不民主”，“路愈走愈窄”。一九六一年六月二十九日，他在电影创作会议上散布流言蜚语，说：“商务印书馆有个人讲，不民主，秦始皇十四年就倒了！”听，林默涵一伙对无产阶级专政、对社会主义制度是何等的仇视！我们知道，在社会主义的今天，什么人才会感到不民主呢？只有那些坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右！林默涵是什么人，站在什么立场上说话，不是昭然若揭了吗！
    林默涵出身于反动的地主家庭，长期以来，他的地主阶级立场并没有得到改造。解放后，他曾把地主母亲接来北京，逃避群众监督。一九六五年，有关单位把一份关于招生工作的意见送给他，这个地主老爷看到意见中要优先吸收工人、贫下中农子女入学，便勃然大怒，深更半夜打电话给经办人，他责问道：“你是什么出身？我林默涵就是地主家庭出身。”林默涵这个彻头彻尾的地主阶级的孝子贤孙，就是这样明目张胆地坚持反动立场的。我们要彻底揭露他的反动面目，把他们这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！
