Recently, in Shaanxi Province's Chang'an County, Shiji Village, to ensure that all commune members study Chairman Mao's works thoroughly, each production brigade wrote many of Chairman Mao's quotations on red paper, beat drums, and sent them to each household. The entire village's masses have an infinite love for Chairman Mao's quotations. When delivering Chairman Mao's quotations, many poor and lower-middle peasants came from far away to welcome them, and some had already chosen the places to hang the quotations. When Chairman Mao's highest directives arrived at the home of poor peasant Feng Maomao, Maomao's mother said, "Chairman Mao's instructions cannot be casually hung. I must hang them in the center of the room next to Chairman Mao's portrait." Some households hung several quotations, and some even framed them with glass and hung them below Chairman Mao's portrait. They said, "Excellent! Now, not only do we see Chairman Mao's kind and amiable face every day, but Chairman Mao's quotations are also hung in our homes. Seeing his directives every moment, we have a direction for our work, and our enthusiasm is greatly increased. We must remember Chairman Mao's directives in our hearts and put them into action."

    毛主席语录贴到了咱家
    最近，陕西省长安县师家村为了使社员家家户户学好毛主席著作，各生产队用红纸写了许多毛主席语录，敲锣打鼓，送给各户。全村群众对毛主席语录无限热爱。当送毛主席语录时，很多贫下中农老远迎接，有的早把贴语录的地方选好了。当毛主席的最高指示送到贫农冯毛毛家里时，毛毛的母亲说：“毛主席老人家的指示可不能随便贴，我一定要贴在房正中毛主席像身边。”有的家贴了好几幅语录，有的还用玻璃框子镶起来，挂在毛主席像下边。他们说：“好极了，我们每天不但看到毛主席他老人家慈祥和蔼的面孔，现在毛主席的语录也贴到咱家了，每时每刻看到他老人家的指示，我们做事就有了方向，干劲就大了。我们一定要把毛主席的指示记在心上，用在行动上。”
