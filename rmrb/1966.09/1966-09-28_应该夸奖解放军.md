In the vicinity of a certain unit of the PLA stationed at the front of the South China Sea, there stands a large banyan tree. During the midday break, many commune members like to come to this tree to seek shade. A soldier and Communist Party member from the local garrison, Liu Jiebu, with the support of his unit's leadership, takes advantage of this opportunity every day to provide free haircuts to the commune members while pointing to the quotations board on the tree and explaining Chairman Mao's works to them, using Mao Zedong Thought to solve various ideological issues among the commune members.

One day, an old poor peasant, Zhang Kangshou, came smiling to get a haircut. From their conversation, Liu Jiebu learned that Zhang's son was coming back from another place to get married and was preparing a grand wedding banquet. Liu Jiebu immediately wrote a quotation from Chairman Mao about frugality and national construction on the quotations board and explained to Zhang Kangshou the benefits of frugality and thrift for the country, the collective, and the family. Zhang heard this and his heart was enlightened. He said, "Showing off and flaunting wealth is extravagant and wasteful, not in line with Mao Zedong Thought." When he returned home, Zhang called a family meeting and decided to follow Chairman Mao's words, change customs, and handle new things in new ways.

Soon, the son returned from another place. On the day of the wedding, there was no alcohol and no banquet. The villagers held up Chairman Mao's quotations board and sang revolutionary songs to congratulate the Zhang family. The commune members all praised Zhang, saying that the matter was well handled and correctly done! However, Zhang pointed to the large banyan tree and said excitedly, "Praise should be given to the PLA. It is they who taught me to study Chairman Mao's works and act according to Mao Zedong Thought."

    “应该夸奖解放军”
    南海前哨解放军某部驻地附近，有棵大榕树。中午歇工的时候，不少社员都爱到这棵树下来乘凉。当地驻军的一位战士、共产党员刘介哺，在连队领导的支持下，每天都趁这个机会，一面给社员们义务理发，一面指着树上挂的语录牌，给社员们讲解毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想解决社员的各种思想问题。
    有一天，老贫农张康寿笑呵呵地来理发。刘介哺从交谈中，知道张大伯的儿子要从外地回家结婚，正要筹备大办酒席。刘介哺当即在语录牌上写了一条毛主席有关勤俭建国的语录，向张康寿讲解勤俭节约对国家对集体对家庭的好处。张大伯听了，心里豁然开朗，他说：“讲排场，摆阔气，是铺张浪费，不符合毛泽东思想。”回到家里，张大伯开了个家庭会，决心听毛主席的话，移风易俗，新事新办。
    不久，儿子从外地回来了。结婚那天，不喝酒，不摆席，乡亲们举着毛主席语录牌，唱着革命歌曲，来向张家贺喜。社员们都夸奖张大伯，说这件事办得好，办得对！可是，张大伯指着大榕树激动地说：“应该夸奖解放军。是他们教我学习了毛主席著作，照毛泽东思想办事情。”
