On the night of July 12, a massive flood struck the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, Ulaanbaatar. Chinese workers from the China Construction Engineering Company's joint processing plant in Mongolia, who were engaged in rescuing and aiding Mongolian materials, heard the cries for help from nearby. They immediately formed a rescue team of 200 people to save their Mongolian brothers.

In the dark night, the rescue team charged into the waist-deep floodwaters. At this moment, Chairman Mao's teachings on internationalism in his essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune" inspired the workers to overcome all difficulties and rescue their Mongolian brothers.

An old worker's leg was slashed by debris in the flood, leaving a deep gash and bleeding profusely. However, he persisted in the rescue efforts and refused to return to the factory. A large car was surrounded by floodwaters, with many Mongolian residents trapped inside. Chinese workers, risking their lives, launched several "assaults" against the floodwaters. They either got injured or were knocked down by the floodwaters, but no one retreated. Finally, a worker tied a thick rope around his waist, braved the flood, and secured the rope to the car. This allowed a large group of comrades to approach the car and rescue the Mongolian brothers. After more than four hours of hard work, over 120 Mongolian brothers were safely rescued.

The heroic deeds of Chinese workers rescuing Mongolian victims received widespread praise from the Mongolian people. Some people, with tears in their eyes, said, "The Chinese people saved many Mongolian lives. The Chinese people are truly good, long live Mao Zedong!"

    激流中的友情
    七月十二日夜，蒙古人民共和国首都乌兰巴托发生了一场特大的洪水灾害。正在中国建筑工程公司驻蒙公司联合加工厂抢救援蒙物资的中国援蒙工人们，听见了附近传来的呼救声，立即组成一支两百人组成的抢救队去营救蒙古弟兄。
    在黑夜中，抢救队向齐腰深的洪水激流中冲去。这时，毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文里关于国际主义精神的教导鼓舞着工人们决心排除万难，抢救蒙古弟兄。
    一个老工人的腿部被洪水冲来的东西划了一个大口子，鲜血直流，但是他坚持抢救，不肯回厂。一辆大轿车上有许多被洪水围困的蒙古居民。中国工人们几次冒着生命危险向洪水发动了“冲锋”，结果不是受伤就是被洪水冲倒。但是没有人退下来。最后，一个工人把一根粗缆绳拴在腰上，硬渡了过去，把缆绳绑在车上，这才使大批同志能够接近轿车，使蒙古弟兄脱险。经过四个多小时苦战，一百二十多名受灾的蒙古弟兄都被安全地抢救出来。
    中国工人奋勇抢救蒙古灾民的事迹，受到蒙古人民普遍赞扬。有的人含着热泪说：“中国人救了我们许多蒙古人的生命，中国人真好，毛泽东万岁！”
