The consequences of the reactionary rule of the right-wing military junta in Indonesia have led to severe famines in some regions.

According to foreign news agencies, food supplies in West Irian are extremely scarce. Stores are empty, and many shops have closed. People are disheartened by Jakarta's indifference towards them. "Some areas have already seen disturbances."

On Lombok Island, east of Bali, a severe famine has been ongoing since last November, resulting in widespread starvation. Local officials have downplayed the number of deaths to 10,000. However, according to reports from Jakarta newspapers, in this island with a population of just over a million, 50,000 people have already starved to death.

Officials on Lombok Island have revealed to foreign journalists that they have repeatedly requested Jakarta to immediately send ships with rice to the island, but have not received any response.

Under the rule of the right-wing military clique in Indonesia, the people are suffering greatly, facing countless disasters and living in misery. In Jakarta, tens of thousands of homeless people wander the streets, struggling to survive amidst hunger and disease.

    印尼一些地区饥荒严重
    龙目岛从去年十一月来已饿死五万人
    新华社十三日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚右派军人政权的反动统治下，印尼一些地区发生了严重饥荒。
    据外国通讯社报道，西伊里安“粮食供应非常缺乏，商店空空的，许多商店关闭了，人们对雅加达表现出来的对他们不闻不问的态度感到沮丧”。“有一些地区已经发生了骚乱”。
    在巴厘岛东面的龙目岛，从去年十一月起发生了饿死人的严重饥荒。当地官员把饿死的人数缩小为一万人。但据雅加达报纸报道，在这个只有一百多万人的岛上，已经饿死了五万人。
    龙目岛的官员向外国记者透露，已经多次向雅加达要求立即派船载运大米到龙目岛来，但是一直没有得到答复。（附图片）
    在印尼右派军人集团统治下，印尼人民处在水深火热之中，灾难重重，民不聊生。在雅加达，成万游民流浪街头，在饥饿与疾病中挣扎度日。
