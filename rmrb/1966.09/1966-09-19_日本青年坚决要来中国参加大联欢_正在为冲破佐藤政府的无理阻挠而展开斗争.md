Japanese youth are resolutely fighting to break through the unreasonable obstruction by the Sato government to secure early visits to China to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 17th: Japanese youth are currently fighting to break through the unreasonable obstruction by the Sato government to secure early visits to China to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering.

Since the 13th, Japanese youth scheduled to go to Beijing in September to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering have been continuously going to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice, demanding the swift issuance of visas for their visit to China. They expressed great indignation at the Sato government's delay in issuing visas.

The leader of the visiting delegation from the Japan Port and Harbor Workers' Union, Yamamoto Nobuhiro, said, "Our delegation to participate in the grand gathering had already formally applied to the government authorities for visas on August 19th," "but until now, there has been no clear response, which is unreasonable." The deputy leader of the delegation, Tanaka Ichiro, said, "We must join forces with other delegations to fight for an early visit to China."

Team member Baba Shuntaro, who came to Tokyo from Hokkaido on September 6th, said, "The Liberal Democratic Party delegation is visiting China, so why does the Liberal Democratic Party government have any reason to refuse our participation in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering? We will fight to the end until the government issues the visas."

Team member Kajiwara Shuji from Kitakyushu said, "We are visiting China on behalf of the broad masses of Japanese youth, and the Japanese government authorities have no right to delay or refuse to issue visas." He said, "We will not give up until we obtain visas to visit China and will strive to achieve an early visit to China."

In recent days, representatives from the Japan Socialist Youth League, the General Council of Japanese Trade Unions, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the New Theater Conference, the Japan Youth Federation, the All-Japan Farmers' Union, and the Japan Journalists' Association, among others, have continuously gone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice to demand the early issuance of visas for their visit to China.

Currently, democratic organizations across Japan are actively preparing to send local youth representatives to Beijing to participate in the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering. In Shimonoseki City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, young people are actively organizing farewell activities. The "Support the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Gathering Shimonoseki Implementation Committee" has been conducting street propaganda since the 10th. Citizens of Shimonoseki City have expressed their support, saying, "We wish the grand gathering a success" and encouraged the young people of Shimonoseki, saying, "Go for it for the friendship of the people of China and Japan."

The youth departments of the Yamaguchi Prefecture branch of the Japan Socialist Youth League and the Shimonoseki branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association held a farewell party for the representatives participating in this grand gathering. Deputy Secretary-General of the Yamaguchi Prefecture branch of the Socialist Party, Edamura Yoshitsugu, encouraged the youth representatives at the farewell party, saying, "Study the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China seriously, learn the fighting spirit of the Red Guards, and apply it to the liberation struggle of the Japanese people." He pointed out that to strengthen the international united front against American imperialism, Japanese youth must deepen their friendship with the 700 million people of China. "Strengthening unity with China, which is fighting persistently, is our common task."

    日本青年坚决要来中国参加大联欢
    正在为冲破佐藤政府的无理阻挠而展开斗争
    据新华社东京十七日电　日本青年正在为冲破佐藤政府无理阻挠、争取早日访华参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢而斗争。
    从十三日起，预定在九月间去北京参加第二届中日青年友好大联欢的日本青年不断前往日本外务省和法务省，要求迅速发给访华护照。他们对佐藤政府拖延签发护照表示极大愤慨。
    日本全港湾工会协议会访华代表团团长山本信晃说，“我们参加大联欢的代表团早在八月十九日已向政府当局正式申请发给护照”，“但直到现在尚不给明确答复，这是毫无道理的”。代表团副团长田中一郎说，我们一定要和其他代表团一起展开共同斗争，争取早日实现访华。
    九月六日就从北海道来到东京的代表团团员场俊太郎说，“自由民主党议员代表团正在中国访问，自由民主党政府有什么理由拒绝我们参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢？我们一定要斗争到底，直到政府发出护照。”
    来自北九州的代表团团员梶原修二说，我们是代表了广大日本青年的心愿访华的，日本政府当局无权拖延和拒绝发给护照。他表示，他们不获得访华护照，决不罢休，一定要争取早日实现访华。
    这些天来，日本社会主义青年同盟、日本工会总评议会、日中友好协会、新剧人会议、日本青年团协议会、全日本农民协会联合会以及日本记者会议等许多团体的青年代表，接连前往外务省、法务省，要求早日发给访华护照。
    目前，日本各地的民主团体正在为欢送当地的青年代表前往北京参加中日青年友好大联欢而积极进行准备。山口县下关市青年纷纷展开欢送活动。“支持第二届日中青年友好大联欢下关实行委员会”从十日起，还展开了街头宣传。下关市民纷纷表示“祝大联欢成功”，勉励下关青年说，为日中两国人民友好“加油干”。
    山口县日本社会主义青年同盟以及日中友好协会下关分会等团体的所属青年部为参加这次大联欢的代表举行了欢送会。社会党山口县本部副委员长枝村要作在欢送会上勉励青年代表说，“要踏踏实实地学习中国的文化大革命，学习红卫兵的战斗精神，并把它活学活用于为日本人民的解放斗争中去。”他指出，为了巩固反对美帝国主义的国际统一战线，日本青年必须加深同七亿中国人民的友好。“同坚持斗争的七亿人民的中国加强团结，是我们的共同课题”。
