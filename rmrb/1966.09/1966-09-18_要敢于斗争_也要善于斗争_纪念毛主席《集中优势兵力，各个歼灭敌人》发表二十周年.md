Twenty years ago, when the Chinese People's Liberation War had just begun, our great leader Chairman Mao, after proposing the brilliant thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, wrote the luminous document "Concentrate Superior Forces, Annihilate the Enemy One by One." Chairman Mao's luminous document summarized the rich experience of the people's revolutionary wars led by our Party and proposed the basic operational principles for winning the Liberation War.

Chairman Mao's thesis that all reactionaries are paper tigers and the principle of concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy one by one are great and brilliant developments of Marxism-Leninism's strategic and tactical thought. They have armed the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country, greatly boosting our revolutionary resolve to dare to struggle and dare to win. They have given us the fundamental method to defeat the enemy, guiding us to achieve great victories in the Chinese revolution. Now, they have become a powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary people of the whole world to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

Chairman Mao teaches us that we must despise the enemy strategically and take the enemy seriously tactically.

To despise the enemy strategically means to regard the enemy as a paper tiger in general, to dare to engage in head-on struggles with the enemy, and to have the confidence to defeat the enemy. Only in this way can we talk about revolution.

To take the enemy seriously tactically means to adopt a cautious attitude in specific issues, to emphasize the art of struggle, and to be good at struggling with the enemy. Only in this way can we achieve victory.

"Concentrate superior forces, annihilate the enemy one by one" is the concentrated embodiment of Chairman Mao's thought of taking the enemy seriously tactically.

Chairman Mao pointed out that in every battle, we must concentrate absolutely superior forces, two times, three times, four times, even five times or six times the enemy's forces, surround the enemy on all sides, strive for complete annihilation, and not let any escape.

Chairman Mao always emphasized that for people, it is better to cut off one finger than to injure ten; for the enemy, it is better to annihilate one division than to rout ten. He also said: Food can only be eaten one mouthful at a time, battles can only be fought one by one, and the enemy can only be eliminated one part at a time. This is called solving problems one by one. To achieve the goal of annihilating the enemy one by one, we must not divide our forces but must concentrate our strength. In this way, the revolutionary people, who are strategically at a disadvantage, can be absolutely superior in each local area and in each campaign and battle, achieving one victory after another. With the passage of time, the revolutionary people can turn from a strategic disadvantage to a strategic advantage, until all enemies are annihilated.

Concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy one by one is the fundamental method for us to defeat the enemy and win, and it is a universal principle of Marxism-Leninism to guide the entire revolutionary struggle. Practice has proven that whether we are engaged in military struggles or political struggles; whether we are making a revolution or building a country; whether we are dealing with the enemy or facing difficulties and work, we must adopt this method. Implementing this method will lead to victory. Violating this method will lead to failure.

In all our struggles and work, we must strategically despise the enemy and dare to "fight ten with one"; tactically, we must take the enemy seriously and treat it seriously, "fighting one with ten." For each specific problem, we should, as Chairman Mao teaches, investigate and study, prepare thoroughly, and not fight battles without preparation and without confidence. We should concentrate our forces and focus on solving one or two major problems in a certain period, sticking to them until they are resolved. We should carry forward the fighting style of being brave, tenacious, fearless of sacrifice, fearless of fatigue, and fighting continuously. We should anticipate all possible situations, think from the most difficult angle, and strive for the best. In this way, we can be in an active position and stand unshakable in any situation; we can be invincible.

Currently, domestically, we are carrying out a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, launching fierce attacks on those in power who are taking the capitalist road and all monsters and demons. Internationally, the people of China and the revolutionary people of the world are engaged in serious struggles against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers, and "concentrate superior forces, annihilate the enemy one by one" have extremely important strategic and practical significance in guiding us to win victories in the sharp and complex class struggles at home and abroad.

Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the people of China and the revolutionary people of various countries will combine revolutionary daring with revolutionary wisdom, and combine resolute and thorough revolutionary spirit with flexible and ingenious struggle art. We will surely defeat imperialism, defeat modern revisionism, defeat the reactionaries of various countries, and defeat all monsters and demons.

    要敢于斗争　也要善于斗争
    ——纪念毛主席《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》发表二十周年
    二十年前，当中国人民解放战争刚刚开始的时候，我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在提出了帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断之后，又写出了《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》的光辉文献。毛主席的这一光辉文献，总结了我们党领导的人民革命战争的丰富经验，提出了取得解放战争胜利的基本作战方针。
    毛主席关于一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断和集中优势兵力、各个歼灭敌人的原理，是马克思列宁主义战略策略思想的伟大的、天才的发展。它武装了全党全军和全国人民，大大地鼓舞了我们敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命决心，使我们掌握了战胜敌人的根本方法，引导我们取得了中国革命的伟大胜利。现在，它已经成为全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大思想武器。
    毛主席教导我们，必须在战略上藐视敌人，在战术上重视敌人。
    战略上藐视敌人，就是要在整体上，如实地把敌人看成纸老虎，敢于同敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，有信心战胜敌人。只有这样，才谈得上革命。
    战术上重视敌人，就是要在一个一个的具体问题上，采取谨慎态度，讲究斗争艺术，善于同敌人进行斗争。只有这样，才可能取得胜利。
      “集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”，就是毛主席的“在战术上重视敌人”这一思想的集中表现。
    毛主席指出，每战必须集中绝对优势的兵力，集中两倍、三倍、四倍，甚至是五倍、六倍于敌的兵力，四面包围敌人，力求全歼，不使漏网。
    毛主席总是强调，对于人，伤其十指不如断其一指；对于敌，击溃其十个师不如歼灭其一个师。他还说：饭只能一口一口地吃，仗只能一个一个地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭，这叫做各个解决。为了达到各个歼灭敌人的目的，就不能平分兵力，而必须集中使用自己的力量。这样，在战略上暂时处于劣势的革命人民，就能够在每一个局部上，在每一个战役、战斗上，处于绝对的优势，取得一个又一个的胜利。随着时间的推移，革命人民就能在战略上、总体上转变为优势，直到歼灭一切敌人。
    集中兵力各个歼敌，这是我们克敌制胜的根本方法，是指导整个革命斗争的马克思列宁主义的普遍原理。实践证明，我们无论是进行军事斗争，还是进行政治斗争；无论是搞革命，还是搞建设；无论是对付敌人，还是对待工作，对待困难，都必须采取这种方法。实行这种方法，就会胜利。违背这种方法，就会失败。
    我们从事一切斗争，做一切工作，对于敌人，对于困难，在战略上一定要藐视它，要敢于“以一当十”；在战术上，又一定要重视它，要认真对待，“以十当一”。对待每一个具体问题，都应当像毛主席所教导的那样，调查研究，充分准备，不打无准备、无把握之仗。要集中力量，在一个时期内着重解决一两个主要问题，一抓到底。要发扬英勇顽强、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳、连续作战的战斗作风。要估计到可能出现的各种情况，从最困难处着想，向最好处努力。这样，我们就可以在任何情况下，都处于主动地位，立于不败之地；我们就无往而不胜。
    当前，在国内，我们正在进行轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，向走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火。在国际上，我国人民和世界革命人民一起，正在同美帝国主义及其帮凶进行着严重的斗争。毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，和“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的光辉思想，对于指导我们在国内外尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中赢得胜利，具有十分重大的战略意义和现实意义。
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我国人民和各国革命人民把革命的胆略和革命的智慧结合起来，把坚定、彻底的革命精神和灵活、巧妙的斗争艺术结合起来，一定能战胜帝国主义，战胜现代修正主义，战胜各国反动派，战胜一切牛鬼蛇神。
