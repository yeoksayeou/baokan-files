Marxist-Leninist works strike fear into the hearts of the Soviet revisionists. The French and Swedish delegations carrying "The Communist Manifesto" and "The State and Revolution" were seized by the Soviet authorities as "anti-Soviet publications."

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Paris on the 15th, the delegation from the France-China Friendship Association's Student Committee and the delegation from the Swedish "Torch Society" recently visited China and strongly protested the Soviet authorities' arbitrary and unreasonable seizure of Marxist-Leninist books and periodicals they carried with them when they returned home via the Soviet Union. These included philosophical works by Mao Zedong, "The Communist Manifesto" by Marx and Engels, and "The State and Revolution" by Lenin.

The two delegations jointly sent a protest letter to the Soviet Embassy in France on the 11th, stating that on September 2, 1966, at 4:00 AM (Moscow time), when the two delegations entered the Soviet border at Ulan-Ude, the Soviet authorities, citing Soviet laws that prohibit the entry of any anti-Soviet publications, forcibly seized the books and pamphlets carried by the delegation.

The protest letter said: "The Soviet authorities, regardless of any explanations or clarifications from the delegation, threatened the delegation that if the seized books, pamphlets, and documents were not immediately burned, the delegation would have to return to China."

The protest letter said: "On the contrary, we are pleased to note the actions of the Chinese authorities: when entering the People's Republic of China, there is no seizure of general Soviet and foreign books, pamphlets, and documents, and no requirements are even proposed."

The Swedish "Torch Society" delegation to China also wrote a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Sweden on the 10th, protesting this incident. The protest letter mentioned that among the seized books were some published by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The protest letter said that while the Soviet border authorities were unreasonably seizing Chinese and Vietnamese publications, they did not touch Western books at all. When the delegation members explained to the Soviet border officials that some of the books they were carrying were "American propaganda materials," these books were immediately returned to them. The same was true for Trotsky's works.

    马列主义著作把苏修吓得发抖
    法国和瑞典人士携带的《共产党宣言》《国家与革命》
    竟被苏联当局作为“反苏性质的出版物”而强行没收
    据新华社巴黎十五日电　最近访问了中国的法中友好协会大学生委员会代表团和瑞典“火炬社”代表团，强烈抗议苏联当局在他们回国途经苏联时，蛮横无理地没收了他们随身携带的马克思列宁主义书籍和刊物，其中包括毛泽东的哲学著作、马克思和恩格斯著的《共产党宣言》和列宁著的《国家与革命》。
    两个代表团十一日在联合交给苏联驻法国大使馆的抗议信中说，一九六六年九月二日四点钟（莫斯科时间），两个代表团从中国进入苏联边境外贝加尔斯克时，苏联当局以禁止任何反苏性质的出版物入境的苏联法律为借口，强行没收了代表团随身携带的书籍和小册子。
    抗议信说：“苏联当局不顾代表团的任何解释和说明，威胁代表团说，如果不立即焚毁被没收的书籍、小册子和文件的话，就要代表团返回中国。”
    抗议信说：“相反，我们满意地注意到中国当局的行动：进入中华人民共和国时，对一般的苏联和外国的书籍，小册子和文件，根本不没收，甚至没有提出任何要求。”
    瑞典“火炬社”访华代表团在十日还曾写信给苏联驻瑞典大使馆，就这个事件提出抗议。抗议信中谈到，在没收的书籍中，还包括一些越南民主共和国和越南南方民族解放阵线出版的书籍。抗议信说，苏联边防当局在无理没收中国和越南出版的书籍的同时，对西方的书籍却一碰也不碰。当代表团人员向苏联边防官员说明他们带的一些书籍是“美国宣传品”时，这些书籍马上就被退回给他们。托洛斯基的著作也是这样。
