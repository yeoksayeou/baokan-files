The great teacher Chairman Mao, all revolutionaries around the world look up to you, and people from all five continents see your radiance. You have opened the path of struggle for hundreds of millions of people, and you have pointed out the direction of progress for hundreds of millions of people.

Wearing a green military uniform, the great commander-in-chief receives us revolutionary youths. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, your warm smile contains boundless trust and expectations for us; your earnest instructions give us immense encouragement and strength. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we will definitely always listen to your words and go into the stormy seas to be revolutionary pioneers!

Five hundred thousand Red Guards and revolutionary students shout with joy, five hundred thousand red hearts beating as one. "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" Revolutionary emotions surge, and the flames of revolution burn. We will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: dare to struggle, dare to revolutionize, be good at struggling, be good at revolutionizing. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, let the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be even more magnificent and vigorous.
