During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Li Da defected from the anti-Japanese front in North China to the camp of the reactionary warlord Bai Chongxi and others in the Kuomintang, becoming an advisor to the puppet government of Guangxi Province and a professor at Guangxi University and Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong. He truly enjoyed a prosperous career.

To support Chiang Kai-shek's policy of "actively opposing communism and passively resisting Japan," Li Da published the extremely reactionary article "The Causes of China's Social Stagnation" in September 1941. This article opposed the Communist Party's leadership of the peasantry in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war and defended the aggressive policies of Japanese imperialism.

In his article "The Causes of China's Social Stagnation," Li Da did not distinguish between just and unjust wars, revolutionary and counter-revolutionary wars. He insisted that "frequent wars" were the cause of China's social stagnation. He also delved into the history of peasant uprisings in China, criticizing and condemning them vehemently. His malicious intent was to blur people's understanding of the class nature of wars, thereby opposing the Communist Party's insistence on a just anti-Japanese war, and providing theoretical justification for Japan's imperialist enticement activities and Chiang Kai-shek's policy of selling out and seeking peace. He slandered the peasant revolution to find an excuse for Chiang Kai-shek to suppress the peasant revolutionary war led by our party. He erased the fact that peasants were the main force of the revolution and the pivotal role of the Communist Party and the people in the anti-Japanese war.

What is even more intolerable is that Li Da actually defended the aggressive behavior of Japanese imperialism in invading China and provided a theoretical basis for imperialist colonial policies. When analyzing the causes of China's social stagnation, Li Da said that the countries surrounding China were all more backward than China, "they could only learn from and imitate China and were not China's match. Therefore, there was no economic competition between countries, which could not stimulate the development of China's productive forces." According to Li Da's reasoning, as long as there was a strong country among the neighboring countries that was China's match, it could "stimulate" the development of China's productive forces. Wasn't Japan a strong country among China's neighbors? With Japan competing with China, couldn't China "develop"? This was purely a logic of exonerating the bandits. Li Da also said: "If China had continued to develop the South Seas from the Ming Dynasty and implemented a colonial policy, promoting maritime affairs, the vast market of the South Seas would have been exclusively occupied by China. From then on, commodities would be massively exported from the domestic market, and industrial production would have achieved astonishing development due to the vast market of the South Seas." Li Da, in the tone of an imperialist bandit, blatantly advocated "colonial policy," "market monopoly," and "commodity export." According to this theory, the colonial policies pursued by imperialist countries such as Japan, Germany, Italy, England, and the United States at that time, the division of colonies, and the plunder of colonial countries were all legitimate. "Survival of the fittest" was not only a matter of course but also beneficial to the weak. This was a complete imperialist bandit logic. Li Da's anti-communist and pro-Japanese ugly appearance proved that he was a cultural traitor and a traitor to the nation.

In November 1946, with the support of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek convened the fake "National Assembly" and passed the fake constitution. To adapt to Chiang Kai-shek's promotion of the fake "constitution," Li Da wrote "Outline of Jurisprudence" with the purpose of consolidating Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship.

In "Outline of Jurisprudence," Li Da first praised and glorified the fake legal system of the Chiang family dynasty, advocating those prisons and penal laws that tortured revolutionary fighters. He advocated that: the constitution of a bourgeois state is a "book of rights for survival, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness," "modern penal law is a humanitarian penal law," "it is a humanitarianism in the implementation of punishment, showing a tendency towards humanization everywhere." Li Da advocated that the law is super-class, impartial to all classes, and used this hypocrisy and deception to cover up the reactionary nature of the Kuomintang's law. Li Da also absurdly talked about some "laws that are universally applicable to all classes."

Li Da's intention in writing "Outline of Jurisprudence" was extremely sinister. He actually wanted to sing praises for the fake "constitution" that is despised by all the people and put "humanitarianism" and "altruism" labels on the Kuomintang's special torture, deceiving the people. It is clear that Li Da decided to be an enemy of the people and loyally serve the dying Kuomintang reactionaries led by Chiang Kai-shek.

    民族败类　反共老手
    武哲文
    在抗日战争时期，李达从华北抗日前线，投奔到国民党反动军阀白崇禧等的门下，当上了伪广西省政府的顾问，又是广西大学、广东中山大学的教授，真是官运亨通。李达为了配合蒋介石的“积极反共，消极抗日”，于一九四一年九月，发表了《中国社会发展迟滞的原因》等极端反动文章，反对我们党领导农民进行抗日游击战争，并为日本帝国主义侵略政策辩护。
    李达在《中国社会发展迟滞的原因》一文中，不分正义战争和非正义战争，革命的战争和反革命的战争，一口咬定“战争频繁”是中国社会停滞的原因；并且把中国历史上的农民起义问题，翻出来大做文章，大骂特骂，大反特反。其罪恶目的，就在于模糊人们对战争的阶级性的认识，从而反对中国共产党坚持正义的抗日战争，为日本帝国主义的诱降活动、为蒋介石卖国求和制造理论根据。他污蔑农民革命，就是为蒋介石镇压我党领导的农民革命战争找借口。他抹杀农民是革命的主力军，抹杀中国共产党和人民在抗日战争中的中流砥柱的作用。
    尤其令人不能容忍的是，李达竟为日本帝国主义侵略中国的强盗行为作辩护，为帝国主义的殖民政策提供理论根据。李达在分析中国社会迟滞的原因时，说中国周围的国家都比中国落后，“他们只有从中国学习仿效，绝不是中国的敌手，所以，国与国间经济竞争是缺乏的，对于中国社会生产力的发展不能有所激励”。按照李达的理由，只要邻国中有强国，是中国的敌手，就能“激励”中国社会生产力的发展。那么，日本不是中国邻国中的强国吗？有了日本与中国“竞争”，中国不是就可以“发展”吗？这纯粹是一种为强盗开脱罪责的逻辑。李达还说：“假设中国从明代起，继续经略南洋，励行殖民政策，发展航海事业，南洋的广大市场早已为中国所独占了，从那时起，商品必大量的从国内输出，工业的生产力，将由南洋广大的市场而得到惊人的发展了。”李达以帝国主义强盗的口吻，赤裸裸地宣扬“殖民政策”，“独占市场”，“商品输出”。按照这种理论，当时日、德、意、英、美等帝国主义推行殖民政策，瓜分殖民地，向殖民地国家进行掠夺都是正当的，“弱肉强食”不仅是天经地义，而且对弱者有好处。这又是十足的帝国主义的强盗逻辑。李达的这种反共媚日的丑态，证明他是一个文化汉奸，是一个民族败类。
    一九四六年十一月，蒋介石在美帝国主义支持下，召开了伪“国民大会”，通过了伪宪法。李达为着适应蒋介石宣扬伪“宪法”的需要，编写了以巩固蒋介石法西斯专政为目的的《法理学大纲》。
    在《法理学大纲》里，李达首先百般美化、歌颂蒋家王朝的伪法统，宣扬那些摧残折磨革命志士的监狱和刑法。他鼓吹说：资产阶级国家的宪法，是“生存、自由与寻求幸福”的权利书，“近代刑法是博爱主义的刑法”，“是行刑的人道主义，处处表现着人道化的倾向。”李达宣扬法律是超阶级的，对各阶级是一视同仁的，他以这种虚伪性和欺骗性来掩饰国民党法律的反动性。李达还胡说有什么“一切阶级所共同适用的法律”。
    李达编写《法理学大纲》的用心极为险毒。他竟要为全国人民所不齿的伪“宪法”唱赞美诗，还在国民党特务统治的酷刑上加上“人道主义”“博爱主义”的标签，欺骗人民群众。可见，李达决心与人民为敌，而为垂死的蒋介石国民党反动派效忠。
