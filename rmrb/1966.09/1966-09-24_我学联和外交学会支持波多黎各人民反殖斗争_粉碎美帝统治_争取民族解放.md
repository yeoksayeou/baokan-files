The All-China Students' Federation and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs today sent a telegram to the Pro-Independence Movement of Puerto Rico, expressing their sincere wishes for the Puerto Rican people to thoroughly smash U.S. imperialist colonial rule and achieve true national independence and liberation as soon as possible.

The All-China Students' Federation and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs sent the telegram on September 23, the International Day of Solidarity with the Puerto Rican People's Struggle for Independence. In the telegram, the two organizations expressed their most enthusiastic support and resolute solidarity with the heroic Puerto Rican people and all organizations fighting for Puerto Rican independence.

The telegram praised the Puerto Rican people for their contributions to the global people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The telegram quoted the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, on the wise judgment that all reactionaries are paper tigers. The telegram pointed out that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger that is externally strong but internally rotten and can be defeated. The Puerto Rican people's struggle for national independence will prove this point.

The telegram stated: "The struggle of the Puerto Rican people is not isolated. The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought fully support you. The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America support you. All the peoples of the world who oppose U.S. imperialism support you. As long as you rely on the broad masses of the people, unite all patriotic forces, and persist in a protracted struggle, the Puerto Rican people's just struggle against U.S. imperialist colonial rule and for national independence and liberation will surely achieve final victory."

    我学联和外交学会支持波多黎各人民反殖斗争
    粉碎美帝统治  争取民族解放
    据新华社二十三日讯　中华全国学生联合会和中国人民外交学会今天在致争取波多黎各独立运动的电报中，衷心祝愿波多黎各人民早日彻底粉碎美帝国主义的殖民统治，早日获得真正的民族独立和解放。
    全国学联和外交学会是为九月二十三日国际声援波多黎各人民争取独立日致电争取波多黎各独立运动的。这两个团体在电报中向英雄的波多黎各人民，向所有为争取波多黎各独立的组织，表示最热烈支持和最坚决声援。
    电报中赞扬波多黎各人民对世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争作出了贡献。
    电报引用了中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席关于一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断，电报指出，美帝国主义就是一只外强中干的纸老虎，它是完全可以被打败的。波多黎各人民争取民族独立的斗争必将证明这一点。
    电报说：“波多黎各人民的斗争决不是孤立的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民全力支持你们，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民支持你们，全世界一切反对美帝国主义的人民支持你们。只要依靠广大人民群众，团结一切爱国力量，坚持长期斗争，波多黎各人民反对美帝国主义殖民统治、争取民族独立和解放的正义斗争，是一定能够取得最后胜利的。”
