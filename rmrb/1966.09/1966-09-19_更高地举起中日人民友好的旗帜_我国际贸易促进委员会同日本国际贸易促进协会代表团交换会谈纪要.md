The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade today exchanged a record of talks with the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Economic Friendship Delegation. In the record of talks, both sides agreed to raise the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship higher, strengthen ties, and closely cooperate, overcome all artificial obstacles, and strive together for the further development of friendly relations and trade between the two countries.

The record of talks said that the leaders of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and relevant units had recently engaged in very friendly discussions with the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Economic Friendship Delegation on the current international situation, Sino-Japanese friendship and trade relations, and issues of mutual concern.

The record of talks said that during the delegation's visit to China, they saw that the Chinese people are all studying the works of Chairman Mao Zedong and, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are striving forward to build socialism. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is becoming a driving force for great development in all fields of production, technology, and culture. The delegation confirmed that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new stage in China's socialist revolution. With its vast land and 700 million people, China's future is boundless.

The delegation believes that the peoples of Japan and China should not fight again and should remain friends for generations to come. The normalization of diplomatic relations and the establishment of normal trade relations between the two countries are in line with the wishes and interests of the peoples of both countries and are an irresistible historical trend that no force can stop.

The delegation emphasized that to achieve the development of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade, obstacles must be removed. As the delegation leader pointed out, today, the biggest obstacle to safeguarding peace and developing Sino-Japanese friendship and trade is the aggressive and war-mongering policies of American imperialism, especially its policy of expanding the invasion of Vietnam and containing China, as well as the anti-China policies of the Sato government, which acts as its accomplice.

The delegation stated that the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade and its delegation, in order to safeguard and develop Sino-Japanese friendship and trade, are determined to raise the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship higher together with the broad masses of the Japanese people, fear no difficulties, and resolutely fight against all kinds of forces that obstruct and sabotage. The delegation is convinced that to safeguard and develop people-to-people friendly trade, it is necessary to build on the achievements of the past, adhere to the three political principles and three trade principles of Sino-Japanese relations, and the principle that politics and economics are inseparable.

The Chinese side believes that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved great victories in the socialist revolution, socialist construction, and the ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Chinese side believes that to develop friendly relations and normal trade between the peoples of China and Japan and to maintain peace in Asia and the world, it is necessary to face and overcome all artificial obstacles on the path of friendship between the two peoples. The Chinese side emphasized that American imperialism has consistently pursued a policy of aggression and war worldwide and is currently intensifying its war of aggression in Vietnam. The Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the Vietnamese people and fully support the Vietnamese people's great struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. Since the establishment of the Sato government, Japan has become increasingly reactionary, willingly serving as a member of the new holy alliance against China, which American imperialism and modern revisionism are plotting in Asia. It is reviving militarism and adopting an anti-China policy. This not only obstructs and sabotages the development of Sino-Japanese friendship and trade relations but also seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. In this regard, the peoples of the two countries, economic and trade organizations, and individuals must strengthen friendly unity and strive together to oppose American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique, and all their new and old followers.

The Chinese side believes that developing friendly relations and trade between the peoples of China and Japan, and promoting normal economic and cultural exchanges, is the common wish of the peoples of the two countries and is in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries. Any forces that obstruct and sabotage the friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan and their vile plots are in vain; they can only end up hurting themselves.

The Chinese side believes that the visit of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Economic Friendship Delegation is successful. Over the years, the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, together with a wide range of Japanese friendly business communities and economic circles, has made unremitting efforts to develop Sino-Japanese friendship and trade relations. The Chinese side expresses appreciation for this and will continue to cooperate and support it.

The delegation made four specific suggestions regarding trade matters.

The Chinese side believes that the various suggestions made by the delegation are in line with the common wishes of both sides and agrees to them, providing strong support.

Both sides agreed that some leaders of the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association have increasingly blatantly shown anti-friendship and anti-China tendencies. In the future, they can no longer be expected to play any positive role in Sino-Japanese economic exchanges. Both sides believe that the responsibility of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade will be even greater in the future.

    更高地举起中日人民友好的旗帜
    我国际贸易促进委员会同日本国际贸易促进协会代表团交换会谈纪要
    新华社十八日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会今天同日本国际贸易促进协会经济友好代表团交换了会谈纪要。在会谈纪要中，双方一致表示，要更高地举起中日人民友好的旗帜，加强联系，密切合作，克服一切人为障碍，为中日两国人民的友好和贸易关系的进一步发展而共同奋斗。
    会谈纪要说，中国国际贸易促进委员会以及有关单位的负责人同日本国际贸易促进协会经济友好代表团，最近就当前国际形势、中日友好和贸易关系以及双方共同关心的问题，进行了十分友好的交谈。
    会谈纪要说，代表团在中国访问期间，看到了中国人民都在学习毛泽东主席的著作，并在毛泽东思想指引下，为建设社会主义而奋勇前进。当前的文化大革命运动，正成为推动生产、技术、文化等所有领域大发展的动力。代表团确认，无产阶级文化大革命是中国社会主义革命的新阶段。拥有广阔土地和七亿人口的中国，其发展前途是不可限量的。
    代表团认为，日中两国人民不要再打仗，要世世代代友好下去。日中两国邦交的正常化和正常贸易关系的建立，是符合两国人民的愿望和利益的，是任何力量都阻拦不了的历史潮流。
    代表团强调，为了实现日中友好和贸易的发展，必须消除障碍，正如团长所指出：今天，保卫和平和发展日中友好与贸易的最大障碍，在于美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，特别是扩大侵略越南和遏制中国的政策，以及为其帮凶的佐藤政府的敌视中国的政策。
    代表团表示，日本国际贸易促进协会及其代表团，为了保卫和发展日中友好和贸易，决心同日本广大人民一道，更高地举起日中友好的旗帜，不怕任何困难，坚决同形形色色的一切阻碍和破坏的势力进行斗争。代表团深信，为了保卫和发展民间友好贸易，必须在过去已有的成就的基础上，坚持日中关系政治三原则、贸易三原则和政治、经济不可分的原则。
    中国方面认为，中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，社会主义革命、社会主义建设和正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的胜利。
    中国方面认为，为了发展中日两国人民的友好和正常贸易关系以及维护亚洲及世界和平，应该正视并克服我们两国人民友好道路上的种种人为的障碍。中国方面强调指出：美帝国主义一贯在全世界执行侵略政策和战争政策，目前正加紧扩大侵略越南的战争。中国人民坚决站在越南人民一边，全力支援越南人民抗美救国的伟大斗争。佐藤政府成立以来，日益反动，甘心充当美帝国主义和现代修正主义在亚洲策划的反华的新神圣同盟的一员，加紧复活军国主义，采取敌视中国的政策。这不仅阻碍和破坏了中日友好和贸易关系的发展，而且严重地威胁着亚洲及世界和平。对此，我们两国人民、两国经济贸易团体和人士，必须加强友好团结，为反对美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏联现代修正主义领导集团及其形形色色的新旧追随者而共同奋斗。
    中国方面认为，发展中日两国人民之间的友好和贸易关系，开展正常的经济文化交流，是中日两国人民的共同愿望，是符合两国人民的根本利益的。任何阻挠和破坏中日两国人民友好往来的势力及其卑鄙阴谋，都是枉费心机的，它们只能搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    中国方面认为，日本国际贸易促进协会经济友好代表团的这次访问是成功的。日本国际贸易促进协会同广大的日本友好商社和经济企业界人士一道，多年来，为发展中日友好和贸易关系作了不懈的努力。对此，中国方面表示赞赏并将继续予以合作和支持。
    代表团提出了有关贸易事项的四点具体建议。
    中国方面认为，代表团提出的各项建议，是符合双方共同的愿望的，表示同意，并予以大力支持。
    双方一致认为，日中贸易促进会的一部分领导人物越来越露骨地表现出破坏友好的反华倾向，今后再不能期待他们在中日经济交流上起任何积极作用。双方认为，日本国际贸易促进协会今后的责任更加重大。
