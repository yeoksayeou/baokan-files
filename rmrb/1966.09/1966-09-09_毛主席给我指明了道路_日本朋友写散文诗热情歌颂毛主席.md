	Japanese Worker's Drama Association Nagoya Worker's Drama Association Chairman Mizuno Tetsuo wrote a passionate poem in prose to commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's reception of Japanese youth participating in the First Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival.

	The poem reads:

	"One year ago on August 26, I saw Chairman Mao Zedong. The scene at that time is still vivid in my memory, constantly appearing before my eyes. That moving scene, that moment of excitement, can still be vividly and completely described now.

	"August 26 is a day I will never forget. From that day on, Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings have guided my life. I realized that his teachings are the path I should follow, and I resolved to take his teachings as my lifelong struggle goal.

	"I understood that the life view and path he pointed out for me are the path that the people of the world must take.

	"Chairman Mao Zedong, you have shown the people where happiness comes from, and you have brought happiness to the people.... You have worked tirelessly and actively for the people. To make all the people of the world happy, to maintain their dignity, you work tirelessly."

	"Since last August 26, deep in my heart, Chairman Mao's teachings have been engraved: A single spark can start a prairie fire. I believe that his teachings can bring hope and warmth to a small individual's strength. As long as one continues to strive in a broader and deeper scope, a small strength can develop into a great strength."

    毛主席给我指明了道路
    日本朋友写散文诗热情歌颂毛主席
    新华社东京五日电　日本勤劳者演剧联络会议名古屋勤劳者演剧协议会委员长水野铁男八月二十六日写了一篇热情歌颂毛主席的散文诗，纪念毛主席接见参加第一届中日青年友好大联欢的日本青年一周年。
    诗中写道：
    “一年前的八月二十六日，我见到了毛泽东主席。当时的情景至今历历在目，时刻映现在眼帘。那动人的场面，那一瞬间的激情，现在仍能完整地生动地描绘出来。
    “八月二十六日，这是我永生难忘的日子。从这一天起，毛泽东主席的教导支配了我的一生。我认识到他的教导就是我应该走的道路，我下决心把他的教导，作为我终生的奋斗目标。
    “我懂得了他给我指明的人生观，他给我指出的人生道路，就是世界人民必须走的道路。
    “毛泽东主席，您给人民指出了幸福是从哪里来的，您给人民带来了幸福。……您辛勤地积极地为人民服务。为了让全世界人民都幸福，为了维护他们的尊严，您不倦地工作着。”
    “从去年八月二十六日起，在我的心房深深地铭刻了毛主席的教导：星星之火，可以燎原。我相信，他的教导可以给一个人的小小的力量带来希望和热。只要在更广和更深的范围内继续不断地努力，一个小小的力量也可以发展成为巨大的力量。”
