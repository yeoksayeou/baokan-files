These days, seeing our Red Guards, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, wielding the revolutionary "thousand-pound hammer," sweeping away the "four olds," and striking fear into the hearts of all ghosts and snakes, I feel immensely exhilarated.

My old comrade and old platoon leader, Dong Cunrui, was also like you, a brave and daring fighter. At fifteen, he joined the Eighth Route Army. In those stormy years of war, he was just like you today, daring to charge and daring to act, until he sacrificed his life heroically. At that time, he was only eighteen years old.

Chairman Mao said: "Our army has always had two principles: first, be ruthless to the enemy, suppress them, and annihilate them; second, be lenient to our own people, to the people, to comrades, to superiors, and to subordinates, and be united."

Dong Cunrui strictly followed Chairman Mao's teachings. He harbored deep hatred for class enemies and fought them to the end, never compromising or wavering. To annihilate the enemy, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his own life. Like countless revolutionary martyrs, Dong Cunrui opened the path to victory with his life.

Dong Cunrui, however, was very caring, loving, and united with his comrades and the people. He always had the people in his heart. Dong Cunrui often said to us, "We are the people's children, the people are our parents, the masses are like water, and we are like fish. Fish cannot live without water, and we cannot live without the masses." Dong Cunrui was a model in observing the three disciplines and eight points of attention. Wherever our platoon stayed, he led us in helping the people fetch water, sweep the courtyard, chop firewood, and repair houses. He never did anything harmful to the people's interests, and if anyone violated the people's discipline, he would criticize them severely. He was the most resolute defender of the people's interests.

Once, a comrade in our platoon used an old peasant's firewood to heat water for washing his feet. When Dong Cunrui found out, he called a platoon meeting to criticize the comrade and apologized to the old peasant. Then, he led us up the mountain to chop firewood and return it to the old peasant. He often said, "We must always think of the people. If something is beneficial to the people, we must do it with all our might; if something is harmful to the people, we must oppose it with all our might!"

Dong Cunrui was a child from a poor peasant family. He became a revolutionary hero thanks to the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the training of the revolutionary army. Dong Cunrui always listened to the Party and strictly followed Chairman Mao's teachings.

Today, our Red Guards, like Dong Cunrui, have also received the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. You study and apply Chairman Mao's works, launch fierce attacks on ghosts and snakes, and boldly smash the "four olds" and establish the "four news" in the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. You have shown deep hatred for class enemies and boundless love for the people. Seeing this, I am so happy that I cannot sleep. I want to learn from my comrade Dong Cunrui, who sacrificed his life for the revolution, and I hope you will also learn well from Dong Cunrui.

Dear Red Guards, let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from each other, encourage each other, overcome all difficulties, and defeat all obstacles. Let us smash the old world and create a brand-new proletarian new world!

    对敌狠，对己和
    董存瑞生前亲密战友　郅顺义
    这些日子来，看到我们的红卫兵小将们，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，挥动革命的“千钧棒”，横扫“四旧”，把一切牛鬼蛇神打得惊魂落魄，使我感到无比振奋。
    我的老战友、老班长董存瑞，当年也像你们一样，是一员勇敢的闯将。他十五岁就参加了八路军，在那个急风暴雨的战争年代，他和你们今天一样，敢闯、敢干，直到英勇献身，当时他才十八岁。
    毛主席说：“我们的军队一向就有两条方针：第一对敌人要狠，要压倒它，要消灭它；第二对自己人、对人民、对同志、对官长、对部下要和，要团结。”
    董存瑞是坚决按照毛主席的教导办事的。他对阶级敌人满腔仇恨，坚决和阶级敌人斗到底，拚到底，决不妥协，决不动摇。为了消灭敌人，他不惜牺牲自己的生命。董存瑞和无数革命先烈一样，以自己的生命打开了通向胜利的道路。
    董存瑞对同志对人民却是最关心、最热爱、最讲团结。他心里永远装着人民。董存瑞常常对大家说：“我们是人民的子弟兵，人民是我们的父母，群众好比是水，我们好比是鱼，鱼儿一天不能离开水，我们也一天不能脱离群众。”董存瑞是遵守三大纪律八项注意的模范。我们班住到那里，他就带领全班同志帮助群众担水，扫院子，打柴禾，修房子。对于损害人民利益的事，他从来不做，谁违犯了群众纪律，他就严厉批评。他是最坚决维护人民利益的人。
    有一次，我们班一个同志用老乡的柴禾烧了洗脚水，董存瑞知道了，就召开班务会，批评了这个同志，并向老乡道歉，又带领我们上山打柴禾送还老乡。他常说：“我们要永远想到人民，对人民有利的事，咱们就要拚命干；对人民不利的事，咱们就要拚命反对！”
    董存瑞是一个贫苦农民家庭出身的孩子。他能够成为革命英雄，全靠伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育，全靠革命军队这个大学校的培养。董存瑞最听党的话，坚决按毛主席的教导办事。
    今天，我们的红卫兵小将，也和董存瑞一样，得到了毛泽东思想的抚育。你们活学活用毛主席著作，向牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火，大刀阔斧地破“四旧”，立“四新”，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，表现了对阶级敌人的深刻仇恨，对人民的无限热爱。看到这种情景，我高兴得睡不着觉。我要向为革命献身的战友董存瑞学习，也希望你们很好地向董存瑞烈士学习。
    亲爱的红卫兵小将们，让我们更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，互相学习，互相勉励，克服一切困难，战胜一切阻力，砸碎旧世界，创建一个崭新的无产阶级新世界！
