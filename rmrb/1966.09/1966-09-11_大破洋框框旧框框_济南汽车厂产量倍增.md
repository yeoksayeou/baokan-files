Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant workers, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have studied Chairman Mao's works extensively, and their revolutionary spirit has soared, driving the entire factory's production to a new leap. From January to August this year, the factory's total output value and production volume have both increased more than onefold compared to the same period last year; costs have been reduced by 16%; automobile performance has reached a new level; and four new types of automobiles have been successfully trial-produced.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers at Jinan Automobile Manufacturing Plant have thoroughly smashed the arrogance of the bourgeois "authorities," boosted the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, broken through numerous foreign and old frameworks, and opened up many good paths for achieving a new leap in production.
