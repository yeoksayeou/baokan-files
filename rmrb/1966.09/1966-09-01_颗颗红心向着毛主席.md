Chairman Mao's Red Guards, how happy and honored we are! We ascended to Tiananmen and saw the great commander Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong Thought is spreading red across the world, and the revolutionary bugle calls echo across the five lakes and four seas. Chairman Mao's Red Guards, our stance is firm and our hearts are red. Our hearts are red like the battle flags on Mount Jinggang, and our hearts are red like the bright lamps in the Yan'an caves. Every red heart is turned towards Chairman Mao, our hearts will not change even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble! Chairman Mao's Red Guards, we are the most revolutionary and our hearts are the reddest. We live for the revolution and die for the revolution. We listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, following Chairman Mao forward through the storms and waves! Chairman Mao's Red Guards, we resolutely carry out the great commander's orders: dare to criticize, dare to struggle, and bravely charge towards the old world. We wield the revolutionary thousand-jin hammer, sweeping away all harmful creatures! Chairman Mao's Red Guards, our fighting spirit is the firmest and our hearts are the reddest. We dare to climb the knife mountain and descend into the sea of fire, fearing neither hardships nor sacrifices. We raise high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, welcoming the rising sun of communism!

Note: Today, I was on the Tiananmen City Gate and saw the red sun in my heart, Chairman Mao. I also shook hands with Chairman Mao. This is a moment of happiness that I will never forget in my life. I was born into poverty, and before liberation, I begged for seven years and was sold like a pig or dog. It was Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that saved me, enabling me to go to university and join the party. On Tiananmen, I shouted the slogan "Long live Chairman Mao" until my voice was hoarse. I couldn't contain my excitement and wrote these few lines of poetry to express my boundless respect for the most beloved Chairman Mao.

    颗颗红心向着毛主席
    北京语言学院　阎纯德毛主席的红卫兵，最幸福啊最光荣。我们登上天安门，看到了伟大统帅毛泽东！毛泽东思想红遍全世界，五湖四海响彻了革命的军号声。毛主席的红卫兵，立场坚定心最红。心红，红似井冈山上火焰般的战旗，心红，红似延安窑洞里明亮的灯。颗颗红心向着毛主席，海枯石烂不变心！毛主席的红卫兵，最革命啊心最红。死为革命死，生为革命生。我们最听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席在大风大浪里前进！毛主席的红卫兵，坚决执行伟大统帅的命令：敢批判，敢斗争，向着旧世界勇猛打冲锋。奋起革命的千钧棒，横扫一切害人虫！毛主席的红卫兵，斗志最坚心最红。敢上刀山，敢下火海，不怕困难，不怕牺牲。毛泽东思想红旗高举再高举，迎来共产主义的旭日东升！
      附记：今天，我在天安门城楼上，见到了我心中的红太阳毛主席。我还同毛主席握了手。这是我一生永远不能忘记的幸福时刻。我出身贫苦，解放前讨过七年饭，被当作猪狗似地卖过。是毛主席、共产党救了我，使我上了大学，入了党。在天安门上，我喊“毛主席万岁”口号把嗓子都喊哑了。我抑制不住自己激动的心情，写了这几行诗来表达我对最最敬爱的毛主席的无限崇敬。
