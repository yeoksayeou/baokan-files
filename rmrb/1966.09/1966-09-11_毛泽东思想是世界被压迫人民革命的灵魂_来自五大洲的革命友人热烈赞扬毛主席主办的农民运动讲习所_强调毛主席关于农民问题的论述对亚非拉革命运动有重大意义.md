The site of Mao Zedong Chairman's Peasant Movement Training Institute, which he established in Guangzhou 40 years ago, has attracted nearly 40,000 foreign friends since it opened to the public in 1954. Revolutionary friends from the five continents have enthusiastically praised the institute as the "source of the Chinese peasant movement" and the "cradle of the Chinese revolution," calling it "the source of our learning and inspiration."

A friend from Guinea, after visiting the site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute, said excitedly, "I have received a great education and inspiration here. We have seen Mao Zedong Chairman's past contributions. His achievements are not only for the Chinese people but also for all revolutionary countries. Mao Zedong Chairman is not only the leader of the Chinese people's revolution but also the leader of the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the leader of the world's revolutionary peoples. Therefore, we sincerely hope that Mao Zedong Chairman will enjoy good health and longevity."

Many foreign friends, during their visits, expressed their boundless love for Mao Zedong Chairman. An Indonesian friend, after listening to the guide's introduction about Mao Zedong Chairman's lectures, sat upright on a long bench in the classroom and said, "Let me be a student of Mao Zedong Chairman!" A friend from New Zealand left a message after the visit: "Mao Zedong Chairman is truly great. He has not only made great contributions to the Chinese revolution but also plays an important role in the world revolution." A British friend left a message: "The greatest figures of this century are Lenin and Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong has organized and built the most populous country in the world so well, which is something no one in history has been able to do." A friend from Mali said after the visit, "I feel extremely honored to be here because this is where Mao Zedong Chairman trained revolutionary cadres, the cradle of the Chinese revolution." He pointed out, "The victory of the Chinese revolution is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has transcended the borders of China and has become the soul of the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world."

Foreign friends, especially revolutionary friends from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, showed particular interest in Mao Zedong Chairman's discussions on peasant issues during their visits. They believe that Mao Zedong Chairman's proposition that the peasant question is the fundamental issue of the Chinese revolution and that the Chinese proletarian revolution can only be victorious by relying on the peasants is completely correct. They said: Mao Zedong Chairman's views are a creative combination of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and they have extremely important significance for the revolutionary movements of countries that are currently struggling for liberation. A Japanese friend said, "Learning Mao Zedong Chairman's views, stance, and methods on the peasant issue is very useful for us." A Chilean friend said, "The Peasant Movement Training Institute is a vivid classroom for learning the experience of the Chinese revolution. The revolutionary struggle of Chinese peasants is worth paying attention to and learning from. When I return to Chile, I will definitely tell the Chilean peasants to advance along the path of the Chinese revolution. The leader of the Peasant Movement Training Institute, Mao Zedong Chairman, wisely pointed out that 'a single spark can start a prairie fire,' which is support and help for the oppressed and exploited peoples of the world."

Many foreign friends were deeply impressed by Mao Zedong Chairman's education of the students at that time with the idea of using armed revolution to oppose armed counter-revolution. A friend from Congo (Leopoldville) said after the visit, "The warriors who came out of this cradle, armed with guns and Mao Zedong Thought, were, are, and will be invincible. The experience of the Chinese people is an extremely precious lesson for the working masses." A friend from Ceylon said, "The Peasant Movement Training Institute has opened the eyes for countries that are fighting for liberation." A friend from Angola said, "We need such schools to train cadres because we are fighting against the enemy."

Foreign revolutionary friends visit the site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute to study Mao Zedong Thought and learn from the experience of the Chinese revolution. A Syrian friend said, "The Peasant Movement Training Institute is not only a revolutionary school for the Chinese people but also for the revolutionary peoples of the world." An Indonesian friend said, "This visit has given me great encouragement and strengthened my confidence in the victory of the Indonesian revolution." A friend from Congo (Leopoldville) said, "I firmly believe that, based on the experience of the Chinese revolution, the people of Congo (Leopoldville) will ultimately achieve victory in their struggle against imperialism and its lackeys, and achieve true national independence."

    毛泽东思想是世界被压迫人民革命的灵魂
    来自五大洲的革命友人热烈赞扬毛主席主办的农民运动讲习所
    强调毛主席关于农民问题的论述对亚非拉革命运动有重大意义
    据新华社广州九日电　毛泽东主席四十年前在广州主办的农民运动讲习所的旧址，自一九五四年开放以来，已有近四万名外国朋友前来参观。来自世界五大洲的革命友人，热烈赞扬毛主席主办的农民运动讲习所是“中国农民运动的策源地”和
  “中国革命的摇篮”，是“我们学习和取得动力的源泉”。
    几内亚的一位朋友参观了农民运动讲习所旧址后激动地说：“我受到了一次很大的教育和鼓舞。我们在这里看到了毛主席过去的贡献。他的功绩不仅是为了中国人民，也是为了所有革命的国家。毛主席不仅是中国人民革命的领袖，而且是亚、非、拉被压迫人民的领袖，是世界革命人民的领袖。因此我们衷心地希望毛主席健康长寿”。
    许多外国朋友在参观的时候，对毛主席表现了无限的热爱。一位印度尼西亚朋友听讲解员介绍当年毛主席讲课的情况后，端端正正地坐在课室里的长条凳上说：“让我做一个毛主席的学生吧！”一位新西兰的朋友在参观后留言说：“毛主席真是伟大，他不仅为中国革命作出了很大贡献，而且对全世界的革命也起着重要作用。”一位英国朋友留言说：“本世纪最伟大的人物是列宁和毛泽东。毛泽东能够把世界上人口最多的国家组织和建设得这样好，是人类有史以来没有人能够办得到的。”马里的一位朋友参观后说：“我能到这个地方感到万分荣幸，因为这是毛主席培养革命干部的地方，是中国革命的摇篮。”他指出：“中国革命的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。毛泽东思想已超越了中国的国界，成为世界各国被压迫人民革命的灵魂。”
    外国朋友特别是亚、非、拉的革命友人在参观的时候，对毛主席有关农民问题的论述特别感到兴趣。他们认为，毛主席提出的农民问题是中国革命的根本问题，中国无产阶级革命只有依靠农民才能胜利等英明论断，是完全正确的。他们说：毛主席这些观点是创造性地把马克思列宁主义和中国革命的具体实践相结合的典范，它对今天正在为争取解放而斗争的国家的革命运动有着极其重要的意义。一位日本朋友说：“学习毛泽东主席关于农民问题的观点、立场和方法，对我们来说是非常有用的。”一位智利朋友说：“农民运动讲习所是学习中国革命经验的生动课堂。中国农民的革命斗争值得重视和学习，回国后一定要告诉智利农民沿着中国革命的道路前进。农民运动讲习所领导人毛泽东主席英明地指出‘星星之火，可以燎原’，这是对全世界被压迫被剥削人民的支持和帮助。”
    许多外国朋友参观后对毛主席用武装的革命反对武装的反革命的思想来教育当时的学员有着强烈的印象。一位刚果（利）朋友在参观后说：“从这个摇篮里出来的战士们，用枪枝和毛泽东思想武装起来后，曾经是、现在是、将来也是不可战胜的。中国人民这一经验对劳苦大众是极其宝贵的一课。”一位锡兰朋友说：“农民运动讲习所为正在为解放而斗争的国家打开了眼界。”一位安哥拉朋友说：“我们需要这样的学校来培养干部。这是因为我们正在同敌人进行斗争。”
    外国革命朋友们来到农民运动讲习所旧址参观，是把这里当成他们学习毛泽东思想、学习中国革命经验的学校。一位叙利亚朋友说：“农民运动讲习所不仅是中国人民的革命学校，而且也是世界革命人民的学校。”一位印度尼西亚朋友说：“这次参观给了我很大的鼓舞，加强了我对印度尼西亚革命胜利的信心。”一位来自刚果（利）的朋友说：“我深信，根据中国革命斗争的经验，刚果（利）人民终将取得反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争的最后胜利，取得真正的民族独立。”（附图片）
