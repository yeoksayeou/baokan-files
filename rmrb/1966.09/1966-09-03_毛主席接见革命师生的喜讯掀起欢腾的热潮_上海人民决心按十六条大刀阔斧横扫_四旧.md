Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao received revolutionary teachers and students from across the country and the capital, and the news has once again stirred up a wave of joy on both banks of the Huangpu River. The ten million people of Shanghai solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee: We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, take the People's Liberation Army as our example, dare to struggle, dare to revolutionize, be good at struggling, and be good at revolutionizing. We will seriously, comprehensively, thoroughly, and unconditionally carry out the Sixteen Points, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

Yesterday and today, from dawn to night, the entire city of Shanghai was filled with songs and cheers. The broad masses of Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary people sang "The East Is Red" and "The Ship of the Great Ocean Depends on the Helmsman" with all their hearts, and shouted long live Chairman Mao. Tens of thousands of students, teachers, workers, and revolutionary cadres rushed to the site of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to express their determination to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee.

In recent days, tens of thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from Shanghai's universities and colleges have taken to the streets, beating war drums and singing battle songs, with the momentum of a thunderous force, sweeping away the "Four Olds" with great vigor. They have developed the struggle, criticism, and transformation within schools into a struggle, criticism, and transformation in society, pushing the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to a new high. When they heard the news that Chairman Mao had received the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students again, they were extremely excited. Many Red Guard fighters and revolutionary students said excitedly: Chairman Mao is the reddest sun in our hearts. Chairman Mao truly cares for us and has received the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students again. This is the greatest encouragement for us. We must follow Chairman Mao's words, further carry forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to venture, and dare to revolutionize of the proletarian revolutionaries, and make the fire of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat burn even more fiercely; we must take the People's Liberation Army as our example and build the Red Guards into a fighting force with higher political awareness and high organizational and disciplinary consciousness. Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Shanghai Electric Power School, and Anqing Middle School said, we must study, familiarize ourselves with, master, and apply the Sixteen Points in the struggle. We must strictly implement the Party's policies and complete the combat tasks of "one struggle, two criticisms, and three transformations" as stipulated in the Sixteen Points. Revolutionary teachers and students of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music said at a symposium that Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai reiterated in their speeches that "we must use ideological struggle and not physical struggle," which is an important directive for our current struggle. We must resolutely carry out the Sixteen Points and thoroughly overthrow all ghosts and snakes.

The news spread to factories, shops, and suburban people's communes. The broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai shouted in unison: Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts the people the most and supports the people the most, and is always heart to heart with the revolutionary masses. They said, with the personal leadership of our great commander Chairman Mao, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and with tens of thousands of heroic Red Guards charging into the fray, this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat will fundamentally change the spiritual face of our entire society. A worker from the No. 3 Steel Plant of Shanghai, known as the "Iron Man of Daqing" by Shanghai workers, Chen Fu said: Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Red Guards are sweeping away the "Four Olds" with an iron broom, reaching every corner, and some old parasites hiding in the dark corners have been dug out one by one. The revolutionary actions of the Red Guards are truly remarkable, truly excellent! Members of the Xuxiang People's Commune enthusiastically praised the young Red Guards as Chairman Mao's good students and good soldiers, and resolved to fight side by side with them, using revolutionary broadswords to thoroughly cut off the roots of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism.

    毛主席接见革命师生的喜讯掀起欢腾的热潮
    上海人民决心按十六条大刀阔斧横扫“四旧”
    据新华社上海二日电　我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席接见全国各地和首都红卫兵和革命师生的喜讯，再一次在黄浦江两岸掀起了欢腾的热潮。一千万上海人民向毛主席和党中央庄严地宣誓：坚决听毛主席的话，以解放军为榜样，敢于斗争，敢于革命，善于斗争，善于革命，认真地、全面地、彻底地、不折不扣地按十六条办事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    昨天和今天，从清晨到夜晚，上海全城处处是歌声，处处是欢呼声。广大红卫兵、革命师生和革命群众，纵情高唱《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》，齐声欢呼毛主席万寿无疆。成千成万的学生、教师、工人和革命干部，涌向中共上海市委所在地向毛主席和党中央表示决心。
    上海大中学校数以万计的红卫兵和革命师生这些天来纷纷走向街头，擂动战鼓，高唱战歌，以雷霆万钧之势，猛扫“四旧”，把学校的斗、批、改发展到社会的斗、批、改，把无产阶级文化大革命推向了一个新的高潮。当他们听到毛主席再次接见红卫兵和革命师生的消息，无比振奋。许多红卫兵战士和革命学生激动地说：毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。毛主席真关心我们，又一次接见红卫兵和革命师生，这是对我们最大的鼓舞。我们一定要听毛主席的话，进一步发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的无产阶级革命精神，把无产阶级文化大革命的烈火烧得更旺；一定要以解放军为榜样，把红卫兵建设成为一支具有更高政治觉悟和高度组织性、纪律性的战斗队伍。上海交通大学、同济大学、上海电力学校和安庆中学等许多学校的红卫兵和革命师生说，我们一定要在斗争中学习十六条，熟悉十六条，掌握十六条，运用十六条。我们一定要严格执行党的政策，完成十六条所规定的“一斗、二批、三改”的战斗任务。上海音乐学院的革命师生在座谈会上说，林彪同志和周恩来同志在讲话中再次强调指出，“要用文斗，不用武斗”，这是对我们当前斗争的重要指示。我们一定要坚决按十六条办事，彻底打倒一切牛鬼蛇神。
    喜讯传遍了工厂、商店和郊区人民公社，上海广大革命群众同声欢呼：我们伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最支持群众，同革命群众永远心连心。他们说，有我们的伟大统帅毛主席的亲自领导，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，有成千上万英雄的红卫兵冲锋陷阵，这场无产阶级文化大革命必将从根本上改变我们整个社会的精神面貌。被上海工人称为“大庆式铁人”的上海第三钢铁厂转炉工人陈富说：红卫兵在毛泽东思想指引下，用铁扫帚横扫“四旧”，扫到了每个角落，一些藏在暗角里的老寄生虫，一个个被他们揪出来了。红卫兵的革命行动真是了不起，真是好得很！徐行公社社员热烈赞扬红卫兵小将们不愧为毛主席的好学生、好战士，决心同他们并肩战斗，用革命的大刀阔斧彻底砍掉资本主义、封建主义和修正主义的老根。
