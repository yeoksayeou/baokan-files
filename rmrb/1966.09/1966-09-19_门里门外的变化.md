The early autumn morning in the mountainous area is particularly refreshing and quiet. Suddenly, with a "creak," an old woman walked out from the gate by the threshing ground at the village head. She carried a basket in one hand, as if she were going to work in the cotton fields. Upon reaching the gate, she paused, looked up, and recited the eight shining, glowing characters on the gate: "Serve the people with heart and soul." Her clear voice uttered each character distinctly.

Who is she? She is the mother of the poor peasant community member Li Hongquan. Although she is over fifty this year, whether she goes out to work or returns from outside, she often recites Chairman Mao's quote at this gate. Now, studying Chairman Mao's quotations has become a common practice for the old woman's entire family and all the community members in the village.

Not long ago, the old woman could barely recognize a few large characters. Moreover, right at the place where the eight characters are written, there was an old sticker that read "Open the door to prosperity." Because of this, the family had a small dispute.

That was about a month ago. The old woman's second daughter, Hongying, returned home from outside, singing and skipping, and tore into pieces the old stickers on the walls and doors that read "No prohibitions" and "Good fortune with many people." The old woman watched the falling paper scraps in a daze. Her daughter's sudden action made her a bit anxious.

Hongying took a stool and was about to climb up to remove the "Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity" picture from the wall.

"Get down! That picture was bought with my money, what business is it of yours!" the mother shouted in command. With a "swoosh," the screen next to the "Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity" picture also fell off.

"This is one of the 'Four Olds,' I want to first clean out the 'Four Olds' in our home..." Hongying pointed to the "Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity" picture on the wall. This usually obedient daughter was now arguing with her mother.

"Mom! Every year we paste 'Open the door to prosperity,' but before liberation, we either fled or begged for food. When did we ever prosper?" The eldest daughter, Hongquan, pointed to the large, old sticker on the door and asked her mother. The eldest daughter's words brought back memories of the old society's bitter life to the mother: Hongquan's father worked like an ox and horse for the landlord and died from overwork. The young sister was sent away as a child bride... The family was miserable, with some dying and others scattering. That year, the mother, carrying the two-year-old Hongquan, begged for food and came to this mountain village, marrying Hongying's father. However, Hongying's father had worked as a hired laborer for half his life, and the family was as poor as could be. It was only after liberation that life became sweet. The needle went through the eye of the needle, and Hongquan's words lit up the lamp in the mother's heart. Yes! In the old society, where was there fortune, prosperity, and longevity for the poor? Where was there prosperity for the poor? These were all lies of the exploiting class.

"Oh! Foolish girl, Mom won't believe in them anymore." The mother wiped away the tears from the corners of her eyes and said with a smile. She heard that this was the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao, and this poor peasant mother's heart became clear. She climbed onto the stool and personally tore down the "Fortune, Prosperity, Longevity" picture, throwing it into the gutter. The mother and daughters pasted a large picture of Chairman Mao receiving the party secretary of Dazhai, Chen Yonggui, and Chairman Mao's quotations in that spot. Hongquan's mother often looked at the benevolent smile of our great leader, Chairman Mao, with sweet satisfaction, squinting her eyes. She said to herself: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your words are the lifeblood of us poor and lower-middle peasants. I must remember them firmly!

From that time on, the mother often asked her daughter to read Chairman Mao's quotations and took them as the highest standard for the family's actions. Once, the piglets in the production team fell ill and did not eat for several days. Hongquan's mother and family were very worried. The mother quickly rushed back to get the white rice from her own home, and Hongying helped to cook the porridge. Hongquan held the sick piglets in her arms, letting the mother feed them mouthful by mouthful. After several days and nights of careful care, these sick piglets quickly recovered and are now fat and strong!

Hongquan's mother's family is changing rapidly. Community members say: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is underway, and everyone is striving to study Chairman Mao's works. Community members are all changing! The changes inside and outside Hongquan's mother's gate are just one of the hundreds of things happening in our mountain village!

    门里门外的变化
    田疆
    初秋的早晨，山区格外清爽宁静。忽然，“吱”地一声，村头晒场边的门里，走出了一位老妈妈。她一手挽着篮子，好像要到棉花地里干活去的样子。走到门前，她停下脚步，抬头念着门上闪耀发光的八个大字：“毫不利己专门利人”。清亮的声音，从她嘴里一个字一个字吐露出来。
    她是谁？她就是贫农社员李红全的妈妈。今年，她虽然五十来岁了，但不论出去干活，还是从外边归来，都经常要在这座门前念一念毛主席的这段语录。现在，学习毛主席语录，已经成为老妈妈全家和全村社员的普遍风气了。
    不久以前，这位妈妈斗大字还认不得几个。而且，也就在这写着八个大字的地方，粘着一张“开门大发（财）”的陈年贴子。为着这件事，一家子还起过一阵子小小的风波。
    那是一个月以前的事了。老妈妈的二女儿红英学了在毛主席亲自主持下制定的十六条后，蹦蹦跳跳地从外边回家来，一边唱着歌，一边把墙上、门上的“百无禁忌”、“人口大吉”等旧贴子，撕得粉碎。妈妈看着纷纷飘落的纸片儿发呆，女儿的突然举动，叫她有点着急了。
    红英拿着板凳，又要上柜子去揭那墙上的“福禄寿图”。
      “下来！这张图是我花钱买的，碍你什么事！”妈妈命令地喊叫着。“沙”地一声，“福禄寿图”旁边的一幅“打金枝”画屏又撕落了。
    “这是‘四旧’，我要先扫家里的‘四旧’……”。红英指着墙上的“福禄寿图”说。这个平时听话的女儿，这时竟跟妈妈顶撞起来。
    “妈！我们家年年贴什么‘开门大发’，解放前不是逃荒，就是讨米，哪一年发过什么呀！”大女儿红全指着这门上挺大的陈年贴子，也反问着妈妈。大女儿的话，引起了妈妈对饱含血泪的旧社会生活的回忆：红全的爹替地主当牛当马，劳累而死。十来岁的小姑子被送去当童养媳……一家人凄凄惨惨，死的死，散的散。那年，妈妈背着两岁的红全，讨米讨到了这个山村，嫁给了红英的爸爸。可是，红英爸爸打了大半辈子雇工，家境也是打灯笼照壁，一无所有。直到解放后，生活才甜起来了。穿针穿在针眼上，红全的话拨亮了妈妈心坎上的明灯。是啊！旧社会哪有穷人的“福禄寿”，哪有穷人的“大发”呢？这统统是剥削阶级的骗人鬼话。
    “嗯！傻丫头，妈以后不信就是了。”妈妈擦去眼角里的泪花，笑着说。她听说这是毛主席号召的无产阶级文化大革命，这位饱经风霜的贫农妈妈心里明亮了。她踏上凳子，自个儿爬上柜子，亲手撕下了“福禄寿图”，狠狠地把它扔进了阴沟里。母女们就在这块地方贴起毛主席接见大寨党支部书记陈永贵的一张大画片和毛主席语录。红全妈时常像灌了蜜水似的，甜滋滋地眯着眼睛看着我们最伟大领袖毛主席那慈祥的笑容。她暗暗地说：毛主席呀，毛主席！您的话是我们贫下中农的命根子，我一定要牢牢地记住呀！
    就从这个时候起，妈妈常常要找女儿读毛主席语录，还把它作为全家做事的最高标准。有一次，生产队里的小猪病了，几天不进一点食料，红全妈一家可着急了。妈妈连忙赶回去拿自己家里的白米，红英帮助熬粥。红全把小猪抱在怀里，让妈妈一口口地喂着。经过几天几夜的细心照料，这些病小猪很快就好了，现在长得又肥又壮！
    红全妈这一家在迅速变化。社员们说：开展无产阶级文化大革命，大家努力学习毛主席著作，社员们都在变哩！红全妈家门里门外这个变化不过是咱山村成百桩事里的一桩啊！
