In Hong Kong, the exhibition of our country's exported machinery and instruments has received high praise.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, September 7th: The exhibition of our country's exported machinery and instruments in Hong Kong closed on the evening of the 5th.

This exhibition, jointly organized by fourteen Hong Kong companies that deal in Chinese machinery and instruments, has attracted nearly 200,000 people from various sectors of Hong Kong and Kowloon, as well as overseas Chinese from five continents and friends from more than 40 countries and regions. Due to the enthusiastic demand of the audience, the exhibition was extended by ten days.

The domestically produced machinery and instruments on display, although far from fully reflecting the glorious achievements of our country's industrial construction today, have been praised by the audience as a rare sight in exhibitions held by Western countries in Hong Kong. They said, "All this is the result of our people reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions." One visitor said, "People can feel the truth that Mao Zedong Thought can produce machines and grain from the exhibition." A young worker from Hong Kong excitedly wrote in the guestbook, "Let the imperialists and revisionists go ahead and ban them! We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and with the leadership of the wise Communist Party of China, we can reach any peak in the world and create any miracle on earth!"

Many overseas Chinese who came specially or passed through Hong Kong visited the exhibition with excitement. They have long lived abroad and have heard much but seen little of the glorious achievements of the people of their motherland under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. Now, they have seen with their own eyes many advanced industrial products produced by their motherland, and they are all filled with joy and pride. An elderly overseas Chinese who has lived abroad for over 40 years excitedly said, "This proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's leadership and the self-reliance policy." An elderly overseas Chinese from Latin America, while visiting, excitedly said, "My eyes may be old, but now they are getting clearer and clearer." He said, "The achievements of the motherland today should be attributed to the great Chairman Mao."

Some foreign guests from countries suffering from oppression and exploitation by American imperialism expressed after visiting: Chairman Mao Zedong's proposal for self-reliance in national construction is very correct. A Filipino friend said, "To progress, to develop, one must definitely take the path of self-reliance as China does."

Hong Kong compatriots watched with great joy the products from Shantou, Guangdong, such as the ultrasonic flaw detector and ultrasonic thickness gauge, and the numerically controlled automatic contouring lathe from the capital of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Yinchuan. They believe that these advanced products coming from regions previously considered industrially backward fully demonstrate the complete correctness of the general line for socialist construction formulated by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. An old sailor, seeing these industrial products designed and manufactured by the people of his motherland, recalled the hardships of old China and could not help but shed tears. He said, "The achievements of the motherland today are mainly due to the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao." An old technician from Hong Kong excitedly said after visiting, "A thousand words, a million words, without Chairman Mao there would be no new China." Many people wrote in the guestbook after visiting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" "We will always follow Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great motherland!"

    中国人民有了毛泽东思想
    能够创造出任何人间奇迹
    在香港举办的我国出口机械仪器展览受到高度评价
    据新华社香港七日电　在香港举办的我国出口机械仪器展览已于五日晚闭幕。
    这个由香港十四家经销我国机械、仪器的公司联合主办的展览，自八月十一日开幕以来，接待了近二十万港九各界人士，以及来自五大洲的华侨和四十多个国家和地区的外国朋友。在观众的热情要求下，展览会曾延期了十天。
    这次展出的国产机械、仪器，虽然远不能完整地反映我国今天工业建设方面的辉煌成就，但观众认为，这次展览所展示的工业水平，是西方国家在香港举办过的展览中少见的。他们说，这一切都是我国人民读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的结果。一位参观者说：“人们可以从展览会中体会到毛泽东思想能够出机器、出粮食的真理”。一位香港的青年工人激动地在留言簿上写道：“让帝国主义和修正主义老爷们去禁它们的运吧！我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有英明的中国共产党的领导，任何世界高峰都能达到，任何人间奇迹都能创造！”
    许多专程赶来或路过香港的海外华侨，怀着兴奋的心情参观了展览。他们长期生活在海外，对祖国人民在毛主席英明领导下所取得的辉煌成就，听得多见得少。现在，他们亲眼看到了祖国生产的许多具有先进水平的工业产品，无不感到欢欣和自豪。在国外生活了四十多年的一位老华侨激动地说：“这证明了毛主席领导的正确，自力更生方针的正确”。一位来自拉丁美洲的老华侨，在参观时激动地说：“我的眼睛虽然已经老花了，但现在却越看越明亮”。他说：“祖国今天的成就应当归功于伟大的毛主席”。
    一些来自正在遭受美帝国主义压迫和剥削的国家的外宾参观后表示：毛泽东主席提出自力更生的建国方针是非常正确的。一位菲律宾朋友说：“要进步，要发展，就一定要走中国式的自力更生道路”。
    香港爱国同胞以极其喜悦的心情观看了来自广东汕头的超声波探伤仪、超声波测厚仪和来自宁夏回族自治区首府银川的程序控制自动仿形车床等产品。他们认为，这些具有先进水平的产品来自以往被人们认为工业落后的地区，充分说明了毛主席和党中央制定的社会主义建设总路线的完全正确。一位老海员看到这些由祖国人民自己设计、自己制造的工业品，回想起旧中国的苦难，不禁热泪盈眶。他说：“今天祖国所取得的成就，最主要是有中国共产党和毛主席的领导”。香港一位老技术工人参观后激动地说：“千句万句，没有毛主席就没有新中国”。许多人参观后在留言簿上写道：“毛主席万岁！”“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们永远跟着毛主席走！”“伟大的祖国万岁！”
