The Chinese Party and State Leaders Send a Telegram to Vietnamese Party and State Leaders, Extending Warmest Congratulations on the 21st Anniversary of the Founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

	New China News Agency, September 1st: On the 1st, the leaders of our Party and State sent a telegram to the leaders of the Vietnamese Party and State, extending the warmest congratulations on the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To Comrade Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Workers' Party and Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Comrade Long Zheng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Comrade Phan Van Dong, Prime Minister of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam:

	On the occasion of the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, we, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China, extend our warmest congratulations to the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese Workers' Party, and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Workers' Party, have achieved brilliant victories in the great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Chinese people are immensely pleased with the brilliant victories achieved by our Vietnamese brothers.

	The Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression is a great support and inspiration to the Chinese people and revolutionary people all over the world. The victories of the Vietnamese people have once again proven that U.S. imperialism is just a paper tiger that can be defeated; the people, once awakened, daring to fight and persevering in the struggle, are invincible.

	Now, the U.S. aggressors have fallen into the sea of fire of the Vietnamese people's war. The Vietnamese people, united as one, brave and skilled in battle, fully unleashing the power of people's war, have beaten the U.S. aggressors into a state of confusion and desperation. U.S. imperialism, in its attempt to expand the war of aggression and play tricks with the "peace talks" to save its failing cause, will find that the heroic Vietnamese people are neither intimidated nor deceived, and the U.S. aggressors cannot escape their inevitable defeat.

	China and Vietnam are socialist brother countries that depend on each other. The Chinese people have always firmly supported the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Recently, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms once again expressed the Vietnamese people's resolute will to fight to the end. The Chinese people express their most resolute and warmest support. The Chinese government has reiterated that the 700 million Chinese people are the staunch rear guard of the Vietnamese people. The vast territory of China is the reliable rear base of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese people have made up their minds and are prepared to, at any time and in any place, join the Vietnamese people in fighting the U.S. aggressors until final victory is achieved.

	May the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam last forever!

	Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

	Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China

	Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China

	Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China

	September 1, 1966

    我党和国家领导人电越南党和国家领导人
    最热烈祝贺越南民主共和国成立二十一周年
    新华社一日讯　我国党和国家领导人一日打电报给越南民主共和国党和国家领导人，最热烈地祝贺越南民主共和国成立二十一周年。电报全文如下：河内越南劳动党中央委员会主席、越南民主共和国主席
  胡志明同志，越南民主共和国国会常务委员会主席长征同志，越南民主共和国政府总理范文同同志：
    在越南民主共和国成立二十一周年的时候，我们代表中国人民、中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府，向越南人民、越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府，致以最热烈的祝贺。
    英雄的越南人民，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党的领导下，在抗美救国的伟大斗争中，不断地取得辉煌的胜利。中国人民对于兄弟的越南人民所取得的辉煌胜利感到无限的高兴。
    越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争，是对中国人民和全世界革命人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。越南人民的胜利再一次雄辩地证明了，美帝国主义不过是一只纸老虎，是完全可以被打败的；觉醒起来、敢于斗争、坚持斗争的人民是不可战胜的。
    现在，美国侵略者已陷入了越南人民战争的火海之中。越南人民万众一心，英勇善战，充分发挥人民战争的威力，把美国侵略者打得焦头烂额，走投无路。美帝国主义妄图以扩大侵略战争和玩弄“和谈”骗局来挽救它的失败，但是英雄的越南人民是吓不倒、骗不了的，美国侵略者无法逃脱它必然失败的命运。
    中越两国是唇齿相依的社会主义兄弟国家。中国人民一贯坚决地支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争。最近胡志明主席发表的号召书，再一次表达了越南人民抗战到底的坚强意志，中国人民表示最坚决和最热烈的支持。中国政府已经重申，中国七亿人民，是越南人民的坚强后盾。中国辽阔的国土，是越南人民的可靠后方。中国人民下定了决心，做好了准备，随时随地同越南人民一道，共同打击美国侵略者，直到取得最后胜利。
    祝中越两国人民的战斗友谊万古长青！
    中国共产党中央委员会主席　毛泽东
    中华人民共和国主席　刘少奇
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长  朱德
    中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
                          一九六六年九月一日
