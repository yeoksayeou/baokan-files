Lanzhou Refinery Becomes a Large-Scale Chinese-Style Oil Refinery by Breaking Foreign Frameworks and Charting Its Own Path for Industrial Development

According to Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, September 19th: The workers of Lanzhou Refinery are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, striving to implement Chairman Mao's wise decision to break foreign frameworks and forge our own path for industrial development. They have transformed a refinery originally designed by foreigners to produce only a limited number of products into a large-scale Chinese-style refinery with advanced technology capable of producing a variety of high-grade products.

Lanzhou Refinery began operations in 1959 and was initially constrained by many foreign frameworks. The original design allowed for the refining of only one type of crude oil and the production of sixteen general petroleum products.

There were two different attitudes towards these foreign frameworks within the factory. The majority of workers believed that they should follow Chairman Mao's teachings on liberating the mind and dispelling superstitions, using revolutionary spirit to break through foreign designs and achieve development and progress. However, there were also a few who believed in foreign frameworks, thinking that they could only operate according to the original design specifications. These two attitudes essentially reflected the struggle between two paths for running the enterprise: whether to follow Chairman Mao's thoughts, strive for self-reliance, and forge ahead with our own industrial development, or to believe in foreigners and follow the path of capitalist revisionism? The workers of Lanzhou Refinery insisted on running the enterprise according to Chairman Mao's thoughts. They studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, continuously engaging in uncompromising struggles against behaviors that went against Chairman Mao's thoughts.

In the absence of technical data, production experience, and specialized equipment, the workers adopted the method of "starting from scratch" and boldly attempted to produce a new product urgently needed by the state. Those who believed in foreign frameworks and technical "authorities" of the bourgeoisie poured cold water on the effort, saying things like, "You have no technical basis, you're just messing around," "You're too crude, not standardized," and so on. The workers, on the one hand, gave a powerful rebuttal, and on the other hand, persisted in experimentation. After 390 trials, they finally succeeded in producing the new product. The quality of the product surpassed imported products, and the production cost was less than one percent of the imported product.

There was a high-grade oil product that the state urgently needed but was being restricted by the Soviet revisionist clique. Lanzhou Refinery had attempted to produce it twice and failed. Foreign technical "authorities" had concluded, "Chinese crude oil cannot produce this high-grade oil." Faced with difficulties, everyone studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and realized that the definitions of foreign "authorities" were not sacred and inviolable. Chairman Mao said, "The history of human knowledge tells us that many theories are not completely true, and through the test of practice, their incompleteness is corrected. Many theories are wrong, and through the test of practice, their errors are corrected." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, the workers decided to break through all frameworks and produce this high-grade oil.

This high-grade oil was finally produced, but the struggle between the two thoughts did not end. Some bourgeois technical "authorities" stubbornly adhered to the frameworks, insisting that one of the product's technical indicators did not meet foreign standards, and declared it "unqualified." The workers, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "only social practice is the true criterion for the truth of human knowledge of the external world," conducted trials of the new oil product to test its quality. After trials, the state appraisal confirmed that the performance of the new oil product surpassed similar imported products.

Urea dewaxing is a new oil refining technology in the world. Bourgeois technical "authorities" made it seem mysterious and unapproachable. The revisionists of the Khrushchev clique also used this new technology to produce oil products as a "trump card" to restrict us. The workers of Lanzhou Refinery were not afraid of ghosts or superstitions and resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "if you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality." As a result, a Chinese-style urea dewaxing technology suitable for our country's resource conditions and technical equipment was created. Those who believed in foreign frameworks and bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" were once again thoroughly defeated in this struggle.

Our country needs a lot of lubricating oil, but the original design of Lanzhou Refinery had a very limited capacity for producing lubricating oil. Foreign experts said, "The capacity of the equipment is fixed, it cannot be exceeded. To increase the production of lubricating oil, you must add more dewaxing filtration equipment." The workers did not listen to this. They conducted a comprehensive investigation and research from the raw materials to each production process, and carried out a series of technical transformations aimed at the weak links. As a result, without adding a single filtration device, they doubled the production of lubricating oil compared to the original design, completely breaking through the foreign frameworks.

Now, Lanzhou Refinery can simultaneously refine three types of crude oil and produce more than a hundred products, many of which are high-grade products that were previously imported; the quality of many main products has caught up with or surpassed the international advanced level. The variety and quantity of oil products are increasing year by year, providing the state with a series of new oil products.

The changes in Lanzhou Refinery over the past few years have vividly proven: as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, arm the broad masses of workers with Mao Zedong Thought, promote the ideological transformation of people, we will produce tremendous material forces. We will break through all frameworks, dare to tread paths that no one has trodden before, dare to scale peaks that no one has scaled before, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress, and create miracles in the world.

    坚决贯彻毛主席关于发展工业的英明决策
    打破洋框框走自己工业发展的道路
    兰州炼油厂建成中国式大型炼油企业
    据新华社兰州十九日电　兰州炼油厂职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，努力贯彻毛主席关于打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路的英明决策，把一座由外国设计的只能生产少量品种的炼油厂，改造成为具有先进技术，能够生产多种高级产品的中国式大型炼油企业。
    兰州炼油厂是一九五九年投入生产的，有很多洋框框。原设计只能炼一种原油，生产十六种一般的石油产品。
    对待洋框框，厂里曾经有过两种不同的思想和两种不同的态度。广大职工认为，应该按照毛主席关于解放思想，破除迷信的教导，以革命精神冲破外国设计的框框，有所发展，有所前进。但是，也有少数人迷信洋框框，认为只能按照原设计的要求办事。这两种态度实质上是反映了办企业的两条道路的斗争：是按照毛主席的思想办企业，自力更生，奋发图强，走自己工业发展的道路呢；还是迷信洋人，走资本主义修正主义的道路？兰州炼油厂的职工坚持按照毛主席思想办企业，他们活学活用毛主席著作，不断地同违背毛主席思想的行为作不调和的斗争。
    在缺乏技术资料、生产经验、专用设备的情况下，广大职工采取土法上马的办法，大胆试制国家迫切需要的一种新产品时，那些迷信洋框框的资产阶级技术“权威”大泼冷水，说什么：“你们没有技术资料依据，是胡搞。”“你们太土，不正规。”等等。职工们一方面给予有力的回击，一方面坚持试验，最后经过三百九十次试验，终于把这种产品试制成功了。产品质量超过了进口产品，生产成本不到进口产品的百分之一。
    有一种国家很急需而苏联修正主义集团拚命卡我们的高级油品，兰州炼油厂曾经做过两次试验，都失败了。外国技术“权威”曾下过这样的结论：
  “中国原油不能生产这种高级油品。”在困难面前，大家学习了毛主席的有关著作，认识到外国“权威”下的定义，不是神圣不可侵犯的。毛主席说：“人类认识的历史告诉我们，许多理论的真理性是不完全的，经过实践的检验而纠正了它们的不完全性。许多理论是错误的，经过实践的检验而纠正其错误。”根据毛主席的教导，职工们决心打破一切框框，把这种高级油品搞出来。
    这种高级油品终于试制出来了，但是两种思想的斗争并没有结束。一些资产阶级技术“权威”死套框框，说产品的一项技术指标不符合外国规定的标准，一口咬定“不合格”。职工们遵照毛主席的“只有人们的社会实践，才是人们对于外界认识的真理性的标准”的教导，对新油品进行试用，检验油品质量的好坏。试用后，经过国家鉴定，性能超过了同类进口产品。
    尿素脱蜡是世界上的一种新炼油工艺，资产阶级技术“权威”把它说得神秘莫测，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也以这种新工艺生产的油品当“王牌”，来卡我们。兰州炼油厂的职工们不怕鬼，不信邪，坚决按照毛主席的“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践”这个指示去闯！结果，适合我国资源条件和技术装备特点的中国式尿素脱蜡工艺终于创造出来了。那些迷信洋框框、洋教条的资产阶级“专家”、“权威”，在这场斗争中再一次输得精光。
    我们国家很需要润滑油，但是兰州炼油厂原设计的润滑油生产能力很小。外国专家说：“设备能力就是这么大，不能超过，要提高润滑油的产量，只有增加脱蜡的过滤设备。”职工们不听这一套，他们从原料到各个生产工序，进行了全面的调查研究，针对薄弱环节进行了一系列的技术改造，结果没有增加一台过滤设备，就使润滑油产量比原设计增加了两倍，彻底打破了洋框框。
    现在，兰州炼油厂可以同时炼三种原油，生产一百多种产品，其中，不少是过去需要进口的高级产品；许多主要产品的质量赶上或超过了国际先进水平。油品品种和产量逐年增长，为国家提供了一系列新油品。
    兰州炼油厂这几年来的变化，雄辩地证明了：只要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想把广大职工群众武装起来，促进人的思想革命化，就会产生巨大的物质力量，就能打破一切框框，就敢走前人没有走过的道路，敢攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，就能有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进，创造出人间的奇迹。
