	Albanian Youth League Secretary Praises China's Cultural Revolution
	Chinese People Further Revolutionized Under Chairman Mao's Leadership
	All Class Enemies' Hopes of Restoring Capitalism Dashed

	Xinhua News Agency, Tirana: On September 3, Saraku, a secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League, spoke to a reporter from our news agency and praised China's great proletarian cultural revolution.

	Saraku said, The great proletarian cultural revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong will achieve important and positive results, and Marxist-Leninist thought of the proletariat will defeat the revisionist thought of the bourgeoisie. The participation of the Chinese people nationwide in the great proletarian cultural revolution will help them further revolutionize under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and in the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve greater leaps in socialist construction. This will frustrate the attempts of all revisionists to seize power and dash the hopes of all class enemies to restore capitalism.

	He said, This revolution shows the unity of the 700 million Chinese people around the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong. This unity is a powerful weapon in the struggle against the enemies of socialism and communism.

	Saraku pointed out that the fact that the broad masses of Chinese youth are participating in the cultural revolution shows that the youth are faithfully following the party's teachings. The bourgeois revisionists are trying their best to influence the youth with their ideological consciousness. China's socialist cultural revolution has foiled this conspiracy of the revisionists.

    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央书记处书记萨拉库三日对本社记者发表谈话，赞颂中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    萨拉库说，毛泽东同志领导的无产阶级文化大革命将获得重要的积极的成果，将使无产阶级的马克思列宁主义思想战胜资产阶级的修正主义思想。中国全国人民参加无产阶级文化大革命，有助于他们在中国共产党的领导下和在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，进一步革命化，在社会主义建设中实现更大的跃进。这使所有修正主义分子窃取政权的企图破产，使一切阶级敌人复辟资本主义的希望破产。
    他说，这一革命表现了七亿中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党周围的团结一致。这种团结一致是同社会主义和共产主义敌人进行斗争的强大武器。
    萨拉库指出，中国广大青年参加文化大革命的事实说明，青年忠实地遵循着党的教导。资产阶级修正主义者竭力企图用他们的思想意识影响青年。中国的社会主义文化大革命挫败了修正主义的这一阴谋。
