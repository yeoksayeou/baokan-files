	Overseas Chinese in France ardently love the great leader Chairman Mao and enthusiastically hail the great proletarian cultural revolution in the motherland.

	Their feelings were fully expressed during a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to France Huang Zhen a few days ago. On that day, Huang Zhen visited Hu Xipeng and twelve other elderly Chinese workers in the suburbs of Paris. They were all sent to France by the Beiyang warlord government to "fight" in World War I and later settled there. The oldest among them is 84 years old, and the youngest is nearly 70. They have boundless love for Chairman Mao and the great motherland.

	The elderly Chinese workers were overjoyed by the vigorous development of the cultural revolution in the motherland. Xu Zihan was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes. As he wiped his tears with a handkerchief, he said, "Chairman Mao personally leads the entire cultural revolution, making China a people's iron-clad fortress. It is truly wonderful!" Other elderly workers also expressed their admiration for Chairman Mao's far-sighted vision, saying, "This is great, Chairman Mao thinks so far ahead. This way, our descendants will all be happy." When they talked about Chairman Mao's good health, 84-year-old Ma Deshan spontaneously raised his hand and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	In Lyon, an elderly Chinese worker named Li (now a taxi driver) told a member of a Chinese delegation, "From the newspapers, I know that a small group of extremely reactionary bourgeois rightists in the country oppose Mao Zedong Thought. They are just talking nonsense. Chairman Mao's words are all correct. In the past 16 years, China has transformed from a weak country into a world power, which proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's leadership. No one can oppose Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao's words must be followed."

	Many revolutionary overseas Chinese wrote to the Chinese embassy, requesting to convey their best wishes to the people of the motherland, hoping for the complete victory of the cultural revolution.

	The elderly overseas Chinese Xue Xuecheng, who came to France decades ago for "work-study," lost ten fingers in a work accident. He held a pen with his two palms and wrote passionately in a letter, "Under the leadership of the beloved leader Chairman Mao, the workers, peasants, and soldiers are holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, uprooting the roots of revisionism, and laying the foundation for the Communist Party to rule for ten thousand generations." He said, "A small group of people who have infiltrated the party and represent the bourgeoisie dream of restoring capitalism and even dare to oppose the people, the party, and Mao Zedong Thought, which cannot but arouse the great anger of the workers, peasants, and soldiers." This elderly man with a disabled body and a red heart studies Chairman Mao's works and domestic newspapers every day after breakfast. In his letter, he expressed his boundless love, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, saying, "I truly love to study Chairman Mao's thoughts" and "I love to read Chairman Mao's works very much."

	Another elderly overseas Chinese who participated in "work-study," Han Zhenshi, wrote, "The people of the entire country are studying Chairman Mao's works. The unified ideology is Mao Zedong Thought. This is great. With the seven hundred million people of the entire country united, we are not afraid of any enemy."

    我旅法侨胞热望祖国的文化大革命彻底胜利
    中国将成为人民的铁打江山
    七亿人民用毛泽东思想统一起来就不怕任何敌人
    据新华社巴黎十六日电　旅居法国的爱国革命华侨无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，热烈欢呼祖国伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
    他们这种心情，在几天以前同中国驻法国大使黄镇的一次会晤中充分地表达出来。这一天，黄镇大使到巴黎郊区访问了胡锡朋等十二个老华工。他们都是第一次世界大战时被北洋军阀政府送到法国来“参战”的，以后就在法国居留，其中年龄最大的已经八十四岁，最小的也将近七十岁。他们对毛主席、对伟大的祖国无限热爱。
    老华工对于祖国文化大革命轰轰烈烈开展，感到欢欣鼓舞。徐紫缓激动得热泪满眶，他一面拿手帕擦眼泪，一面说：“毛主席他老人家亲自领导整个文化大革命，使我们中国成为人民的铁打江山。真是太令人高兴了！”其他老华工也对毛主席胸怀千年大计、万年大计无限敬佩，纷纷说：“这太好了，毛主席想得真远，这样，我们子子孙孙都能幸福。”当他们谈到毛主席身体十分健康时，八十四岁的马得山情不自禁地举手欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    在里昂，一个姓李的老华工（现在是出租汽车司机）对一个中国代表团的人员说：“看到报纸，知道国内有一小撮极端反动的资产阶级右派分子反对毛泽东思想。他们简直是胡说八道。毛主席的话都是对的，十六年来，中国从一个弱国变成一个世界强国，这证明了毛主席领导的英明正确。谁反对毛主席都不行，毛主席的话必须照着办。”
    许多革命华侨写信给中国大使馆，要求向祖国人民转达他们的祝愿，祝文化大革命取得彻底的胜利。
    老华侨薛学诚是几十年前参加“勤工俭学”来到法国的。他在一次工伤事故中失去了十个手指，他用两只手掌捧着笔在信里热情洋溢地写道，在敬爱的领袖毛主席领导下，工农兵高举毛泽东思想红旗，挖掉修正主义的根子，这就“奠定共产党执政万代的基础”。他说：“一小撮混进党内代表资产阶级的人，梦想闹资本主义复辟，甚至胆敢反人民、反党、反毛泽东思想，不能不引起工农兵极大的愤怒。”这个身残心红的老人，每天早饭后都要学习毛主席著作和国内书报。他在信里表达了对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰和无限崇拜，他说，“我真心热爱学习毛主席的思想”，“非常喜爱阅读毛主席的著作”。
    参加“勤工俭学”的另一个老华侨韩振世写道：“全国人民都学习毛主席著作。统一的思想是毛泽东思想，这太好了。全国七亿人民一条心，不怕任何敌人。”
