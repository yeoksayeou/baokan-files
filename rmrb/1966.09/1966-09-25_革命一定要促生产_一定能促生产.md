The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must promote production and will promote production. This is because it uproots the old ideas in people's minds, promotes the revolutionization of people's thinking, and thereby arouses people's consciousness and creativity.

In the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have further intensified our study of Chairman Mao's works. Each workshop and production team has further carried forward the spirit of unity and mutual assistance. When one workshop encounters difficulties, other workshops send politically conscious, enthusiastic, and skilled workers to provide support, embodying the lofty spirit of seeking no personal gain and being devoted to the collective good. All these are the results of our efforts in grasping the revolution.

We must launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the Sixteen Points. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the Sixteen Points as a weapon, grasp the revolution, promote production, and ensure a bumper harvest in both the Cultural Revolution and production.

    无产阶级文化大革命一定要促进生产，一定会促进生产，因为它铲除了人们头脑里的旧思想，促进了人的思想革命化，从而激发了人的自觉性和创造性。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们进一步加强了毛主席著作的学习。各个车间，各个生产组，也进一步发扬了团结互助的精神，一个车间有困难，各个车间都派出觉悟高，干劲大，技术好的工人去支援，体现了毫不利己专门利人的崇高风格。这些，都是我们抓了革命的结果。
    我们一定要掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作、活学活用十六条的新高潮，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以十六条为武器，抓革命，促生产，保证文化大革命和生产双丰收。
