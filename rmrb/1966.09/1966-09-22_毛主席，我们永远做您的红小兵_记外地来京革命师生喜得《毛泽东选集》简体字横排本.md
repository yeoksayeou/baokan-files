Chairman Mao, we will forever be your little red guards
—Recording the joy of revolutionary teachers and students from outside Beijing receiving the simplified Chinese horizontal edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"

The first volume of the simplified Chinese horizontal edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was released in the capital today. As the sun rose, long queues formed in front of more than 20 Xinhua Bookstores and bookstalls in the capital. The majority of the people in the queues were revolutionary teachers and students from all over the country, their hearts burning with excitement as they eagerly awaited the happy moment. They sang "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" and "I Love to Read Chairman Mao's Book" over and over again, recited "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in unison, and many young revolutionaries wrote down their excited feelings in their diaries.

Firecrackers exploded, drums beat, and the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" grew louder and louder. In an instant, the red-wrapped copies of Chairman Mao's works were in the hands of the revolutionary teachers and students. They embraced each other, shouting excitedly, "We all have it! We all have it!" Some people quickly wrote on the first page of the book: "Purchased in the capital on September 21."

What a memorable and happy day this is! Tens of thousands of red guards and revolutionary teachers and students from outside Beijing, who came to Beijing for revolutionary linkage, obtained Chairman Mao's works today in his presence.

Next to the dining hall where the first big-character poster was posted at Peking University, a bookstall was specially set up. Red flags flew, and drums beat. A young red guard from Wuhan, with a red scarf around his neck, said excitedly, "The party has given us Chairman Mao's book, which is the greatest care the party has shown us. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the party, and loyal to the people, and carry out the Cultural Revolution to the end!" As soon as he finished speaking, revolutionary teachers and students from all over the country enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" Many people, upon receiving Chairman Mao's works, first opened the cover page and gazed deeply at Chairman Mao's portrait. A son of a poor peasant took a pen and wrote on the red paper wrapping the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong": "Dearest Chairman Mao, you are forever the red sun in my heart."

Two red guards who were about to leave the capital heard the good news of the sale of the simplified Chinese horizontal edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and immediately rushed to the bookstore near the station. The train was about to depart, but a long queue had formed in front of the bookstore. The revolutionary teachers and students who were in front immediately let the two red guards buy the books first. The two young revolutionaries received Chairman Mao's book, held it tightly in their hands, and pressed it against their chests as they ran back to the station. The sun shone on their smiling faces.

Three middle school students who arrived in Beijing from the revolutionary historical city of Zunyi last night obtained Chairman Mao's book today, and they felt extremely happy. They said: We red guards cannot be without Chairman Mao's book for a moment. We red guards swear: We will forever follow Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao through storms and waves, and make revolution all our lives! A red guard wearing a badge with Chairman Mao's portrait wrote on the red paper wrapping the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong": We come from the hometown of the great leader Chairman Mao, we come to the center of the world revolution, the capital of the great motherland—Beijing, and we have seen our great leader Chairman Mao. This is the greatest happiness and greatest glory of our lives. Chairman Mao, today we have obtained your great works, the compass for making revolution. We promise you, we will read your book all our lives, follow your words all our lives, act according to your instructions all our lives, and be your little red guards all our lives! Wish you eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao's book is the treasure for the million serfs in Tibet to make revolution. After coming to Beijing, a Tibetan student from the Southwest Nationalities Institute, a serf who has stood up, has already bought the Tibetan version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and today he obtained a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He said: "My Chinese is not good, and I still have difficulties reading Chairman Mao's book, but with class feelings, no difficulty can stop me."

    毛主席，我们永远做您的红小兵
    ——记外地来京革命师生喜得《毛泽东选集》简体字横排本
    《毛泽东选集》简体字横排本第一卷今天在首都发行。当朝阳喷薄而出的时候，首都二十多个新华书店门市部和售书亭前，就出现了长长的队伍。队伍中绝大部分是来自祖国各地的革命师生，他们怀着一颗颗火热的心，急切地等待着幸福时刻的到来。他们一遍又一遍地高歌《大海航行靠舵手》《毛主席的书我最爱读》，集体朗读《毛主席语录》，许多革命小将还在日记本上记下自己的激动心情……。
    鞭炮齐鸣，锣鼓声喧，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声一浪高过一浪。转眼间，一册册用红纸封装的毛主席著作，送到了革命师生的手中。他们互相拥抱，兴奋地喊着：“我们都有了！我们都有了！”有的人赶紧在书的扉页上写下：“九月二十一日购于首都”。
    这是多么令人难忘的幸福的一天啊！有几万名来北京进行革命串连的外地红卫兵和革命师生，今天在毛主席身边得到了毛主席的著作。
    在北京大学贴出第一张革命大字报的大饭厅旁，专门搭起了售书亭。这里红旗飘飘，锣鼓喧天。一个胸前飘动着红领巾的武汉市红卫兵小将激动地说：“党把毛主席的书发给我们，这是党对我们最大的关怀，我们一定听毛主席的话，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”话音刚落，来自五湖四海的革命师生热烈地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”许多人得到毛主席著作，首先打开扉页，深情地望着毛主席像。一位贫农的儿子，拿起笔在包着《毛泽东选集》的红纸上写道：“最最敬爱的毛主席，永远永远是我心中的红太阳。”
    两位即将离开首都的红卫兵，听到出售《毛泽东选集》简体字横排本的喜讯，立即转身跑步到车站附近的新华书店。火车很快就要开了，但书店门前排着长长的队伍，排在前面的一些革命师生，立即让这两位红卫兵优先购买。这两位革命小将得到了毛主席的书，双手捧着，又紧紧地贴在胸口上，转身向车站跑去。阳光映红了他们的笑脸。
    有三位中学生昨天晚上刚从革命历史名城遵义来到北京，今天就得到了毛主席的书，他们感到太幸福了。他们说：我们红卫兵一时一刻也离不开毛主席的书。我们红卫兵宣誓：永远听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席在大风大浪中闹一辈子革命！一位戴着有毛主席像的纪念章的红卫兵，在封装《毛泽东选集》的红纸上写道：我们来自伟大领袖毛主席故乡，我们来到世界革命的中心、伟大祖国的首都——北京，见到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席。这是我们一生中最大的幸福，最大的光荣。毛主席啊，我们今天又得到您老人家的伟大著作，有了闹革命的指南针。我们向您老人家保证，我们一辈子读您的书，一辈子听您的话，一辈子按照您的指示办事，一辈子做您的红小兵！祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席的书是西藏百万翻身农奴闹革命的法宝。西南民族学院藏族学生、翻身农奴土登来北京后，已经买到了藏文版的《毛主席语录》，今天他又得到了一册《毛泽东选集》。他说：“我的汉语程度低，读毛主席的书还有困难，但是带着阶级感情学，就什么困难也挡不住。”
