Chairman Mao said: "The hyena-like imperialists should remember that the era when they could arbitrarily manipulate the fate of mankind and carve up Asian and African countries at will has gone forever."

With the help of the Soviet revisionist leadership, U.S. imperialism is shifting its global strategic focus from Europe to Asia, actively forming an anti-China encirclement, and intensifying its suppression of the peoples of various Asian countries. However, the armed struggles of the Asian peoples against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys are rising and developing in broader regions.

The people of Laos, who have a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition, continued to wage a people's war this year, foiling multiple attacks and encroachments by U.S. aggressors commanding the right-wing military of Laos against the liberated areas of Laos. In the first half of the year, the patriotic military and civilians of Laos annihilated more than 6,240 enemy troops, shot down 158 U.S. aircraft, and achieved many major victories. The people of Laos have also extensively launched guerrilla warfare, consolidating and expanding the liberated areas, making the liberated areas a solid political, military, and economic anti-U.S. and national salvation base, creating favorable conditions for winning new and greater victories.

In September, Nouhak Phoumsavan, a representative of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, said with great confidence: The people of Laos have applied Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts on people's war and have achieved great victories in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. In the future, "no matter how much military aid the U.S. imperialists give to the right-wing forces in Laos, the final victory will definitely belong to the people of Laos."

In Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines, people's armed struggles are becoming increasingly active. Especially in Thailand, a major U.S. invasion base, people's armed struggles under the leadership of the Thai Patriotic Front are rapidly developing. Now, in the northeastern and entire southern regions of Thailand, people's armed forces have been fighting more frequently in the first half of the year, continuously defeating the "encirclement and suppression" by the U.S.-Thai reactionaries. The rapid development of people's armed struggles in Thailand has made the U.S. ruling clique anxious, fearing the emergence of a "new Vietnam."

In other regions of Asia, whether in Pakistan and Cambodia or in Japan under U.S. imperialist control, the people's anti-U.S. waves are surging higher and higher, strongly impacting U.S. imperialism.

The brutal suppression and frenzied attacks by the Indian National Congress and the right-wing military clique in Indonesia on revolutionary masses are awakening the broad masses of the people in these two countries. The struggle for survival and against oppression by people of all strata in India has swept across all fourteen states. In the heartland regions of Central and East Java, where white terror is most severe under the rule of the Indonesian right-wing forces, revolutionary people are still carrying out revolutionary actions such as distributing leaflets and attacking right-wing reactionary organizations and police. The right-wing military clique in Indonesia, which appears ferocious, is actually sitting on a volcano.

    亚洲人民革命浪潮汹涌澎湃
    毛主席说：“帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运、任意宰割亚非国家的时代，已经一去不复返了。”
    美帝国主义在苏联修正主义领导集团的帮助下，正在把全球战略重点从欧洲移到亚洲，积极拼凑反华包围圈，加紧镇压亚洲各国人民。但是，亚洲人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争，正在更广大地区兴起和发展。
    有着光荣革命斗争传统的老挝人民，今年继续开展人民战争，粉碎了美国侵略者指挥老挝右派军队向老挝解放区发动的多次进攻和蚕食。老挝爱国军民在上半年共歼敌六千二百四十多名，打落美国飞机一百五十八架，取得许多重大的胜利。老挝人民还广泛展开游击战争，巩固和扩大解放区，使解放区成为政治上、军事上和经济上巩固的抗美救国根据地，为争取新的更大的胜利创造了有利条件。
    老挝爱国战线党中央代表诺哈·冯沙万在九月间曾经满怀信心地说：老挝人民运用了毛泽东主席关于人民战争的思想，已经在抗美救国斗争中取得了伟大胜利。今后“不管美帝国主义给老挝右派势力多少军事援助，最后胜利一定属于老挝人民。”
    在泰国、马来亚和菲律宾，人民武装斗争也日益活跃。特别是在美国的重要侵略基地泰国，人民武装斗争在泰国爱国阵线的领导下，迅速发展。现在，在泰国东北部和整个南部地区，人民武装在今年上半年作战次数越来越多，不断打垮美泰反动派的“围剿”。泰国人民武装斗争的迅速发展，使美国统治集团惊慌不安，他们非常担心会出现一个“新的越南”。
    在亚洲其他地区，无论是在巴基斯坦和柬埔寨，还是在处于美帝国主义控制下的日本，人民的反美怒潮也是一浪高过一浪，强烈地冲击着美帝国主义。
    印度国大党和印度尼西亚右派军人集团对革命群众进行的残酷镇压和疯狂进攻，正在促进这两个国家广大人民群众的革命觉醒。印度各阶层人民争生存、反迫害的斗争，席卷了全印度十四个邦。在印度尼西亚右派势力统治下白色恐怖最严重的中爪哇、东爪哇等腹心地区，革命人民仍然在进行着散发传单、袭击右派反动组织和军警的革命行动。表面上张牙舞爪的印尼右派军人集团，实际上是坐在一座火山上。（附图片）
