	Recently, Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in a meeting with revolutionary teachers and students from outside Beijing: "We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and use cultural struggle, not physical struggle. We must not resort to violence." We wholeheartedly support and will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's and Comrade Lin Biao's wise instructions.

	We are Chairman Mao's most loyal Red Guards, and we listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to venture, and dare to fight. We dare to revolutionize and dare to rebel. At the same time, we know that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. For us, who have grown up in a peaceful environment and lack experience in class struggle, we must learn from Chairman Mao's works in the midst of struggle and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

	We not only dare to revolutionize and dare to struggle, but we also must be good at revolutionizing and struggling; we must learn the skills of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	We are a country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and we have every condition to politically overthrow, smash, and expose all anti-party and anti-socialist rightists.

	Cultural struggle means to fully expose and deeply criticize, to reveal the ugly faces of all ghosts and monsters, so that the broad masses can learn from these negative examples, raise their class consciousness, and achieve the goal of isolating the enemy to the greatest extent.

	Cultural struggle can educate the masses, raise their class consciousness, win over the middle elements, and achieve the goal of uniting more than ninety-five percent of the masses.

	Cultural struggle can prevent bad elements from taking advantage and causing trouble, prevent those with ulterior motives from profiting, and strike at the true enemies.

	Cultural struggle can raise the vigilance of the broad revolutionary masses, strengthen their class struggle consciousness, give them enough confidence to supervise and reform all bad elements, and strengthen the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	We advocate cultural struggle, which reflects the Party's unlimited trust in the broad masses. Because the truth is in the hands of the proletariat. We believe that the broad revolutionary masses can subdue the enemy with the method of cultural struggle. At the same time, the powerful state apparatus is in the hands of the proletariat, and we are not afraid of any sabotage by the enemy.

	Using cultural struggle and not physical struggle is an important policy of the Party in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must seriously study this policy and resolutely carry it out. Only by learning cultural struggle in the midst of struggle, learning to use one's brain, learning to analyze complex matters, and learning the skills of class struggle, can we gradually cultivate ourselves into strong successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    敢于革命，也要善于革命
    红卫兵战校（原清华附中）红卫兵　叶侨生
    最近，林彪同志在接见外地来京的革命师生大会上指出：“我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，要用文斗，不用武斗。不要动手打人。”对于毛主席和林彪同志这一英明的指示，我们双手拥护，坚决执行。
    我们是毛主席最忠实的红卫兵，最听毛主席的话。我们在无产阶级文化大革命中，敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢干，敢于革命、敢于造反。同时，我们也知道，无产阶级文化大革命，是一场极其尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争。对我们这些在和平环境下长大的、缺乏阶级斗争经验的广大青少年来说，必须在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。
    我们不仅要敢于革命，敢于斗争，也要善于革命，善于斗争；学会在无产阶级专政的条件下进行阶级斗争的本领。
    我们是无产阶级专政的国家，完全有条件在政治上把一切反党反社会主义的右派分子斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    文斗，就是要充分地揭露，深刻地批判，把一切牛鬼蛇神的丑恶面目暴露出来，使广大群众从这些反面教材中，受到教育，提高阶级觉悟，达到最大限度地孤立敌人的目的。
    文斗，可以教育群众，提高群众的阶级觉悟，争取中间派，达到团结百分之九十五以上的群众的目的。
    文斗，可以防止坏分子乘机破坏，防止别有用心的人从中渔利，打击真正的敌人。
    文斗，可以提高广大革命群众的警惕性，增强阶级斗争的观念，使他们有足够的信心，监督和改造一切坏分子，加强无产阶级专政的作用。
    我们主张文斗，体现了党对广大群众的无限信任。因为真理是掌握在无产阶级手里的。我们相信：广大革命群众，用文斗的办法足以制服敌人。同时，强大的国家机器掌握在无产阶级手里，不怕敌人的任何捣乱。
    用文斗，不用武斗，是党在无产阶级文化大革命中的一项重要政策。我们一定要认真学习这项政策，坚决贯彻执行这项政策。只有在斗争中，学会文斗，学会动脑筋，学会分析复杂的事物的能力，学会阶级斗争的本领，才能把自己逐渐培养成坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
