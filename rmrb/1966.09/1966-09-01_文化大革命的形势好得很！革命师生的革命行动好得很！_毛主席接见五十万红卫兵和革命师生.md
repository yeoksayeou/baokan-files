Today, Tiananmen Square is filled with countless red flags fluttering in the wind. Millions of Red Guards wearing red armbands, holding red-covered copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and singing revolutionary songs such as "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." The entire square is a surging sea of red.

At 5:40 PM, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, along with his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, as well as Comrade He Long, accompanied by Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Yang Chengwu, arrived in Tiananmen Square in an open-top car, coming among the vast number of Red Guards and revolutionary students. At this moment, the square was filled with boundless enthusiasm, with everyone cheering and jumping towards Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's car slowly circled the square, with millions of pairs of eyes filled with deep affection looking towards Chairman Mao, and millions of revolutionary red hearts towards the red sun. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao!" echoed through the sky.

Chairman Mao was dressed in a green military uniform, with a radiant face and a spirited demeanor, continuously waving and greeting the Red Guards and revolutionary students.

Behind Chairman Mao's car, the second car carried Comrades Zhou Enlai, Tao Zhu, Nie Rongzhen, and Jiang Qing. The third car carried Comrades Deng Xiaoping, Kang Sheng, Liu Shaoqi, and Chen Yi. The fourth car carried Comrades Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Chen Yun, and Dong Biwu. The fifth car carried Comrades Ye Jianying, Xiao Hua, Wang Renzhong, Liu Zhijian, and Zhang Chunqiao. Comrades Yang Yong, Liao Hansheng, Fu Chongbi, Wu De, Zhou Rongxin, and Yu Sang, in their cars, led the way for Chairman Mao and other central leaders.

After Chairman Mao and other central leaders circled the square in their cars, they ascended the Tiananmen Gate under the music of "The East Is Red." At this moment, the more than 300 revolutionary youngsters from all over the country and the capital who were invited to ascend the Tiananmen Gate enthusiastically cheered for Chairman Mao, wishing Chairman Mao a long life. They also put red scarves and Red Guard armbands on Chairman Mao.

At 6:40 PM, Comrade Jiang Qing, the first deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, announced the beginning of the meeting to receive revolutionary students and teachers from outside Beijing. Comrade Jiang Qing, on behalf of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, greeted everyone and said, "We warmly welcome you all and extend revolutionary greetings to you."

Comrade Lin Biao began his speech amid prolonged and enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

He, on behalf of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, greeted everyone.

He pointed out that the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent! He enthusiastically praised the Red Guards and revolutionary students in various schools. He said, "You have done a lot of good things, and you have made a lot of good proposals. We are very happy, and we strongly support you! We resolutely oppose suppressing you! Your revolutionary actions are excellent!"

"We must, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, dare to struggle, dare to revolutionize, be good at struggling, and be good at revolutionizing. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and earnestly, thoroughly, completely, and unconditionally implement the Sixteen Points."

"We must, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, distinguish between our enemies and our friends. We must pay attention to uniting the majority and concentrating our efforts to strike down a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. The focus of the struggle is on those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must grasp this direction of the struggle."

"We must, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, use cultural struggle and not physical struggle. We must not beat people."

Comrade Lin Biao said, "As long as we earnestly read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely achieve great victory! Let imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries tremble in the face of our victory!"

Comrade Zhou Enlai then spoke at the meeting.

Comrade Zhou Enlai enthusiastically hailed the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards and revolutionary youth, supporting the revolutionary linking-up activities of revolutionary students and teachers nationwide.

He said: "Our Red Guards are established with the People's Liberation Army as their model. To learn from the People's Liberation Army is the battle cry of the Red Guards. The Red Guards must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, serve the people wholeheartedly, learn from the People's Liberation Army's three-eight style, observe the three main disciplines and eight points for attention, protect the interests of the masses, safeguard state property, and create a good socialist new atmosphere. The Red Guards must build themselves into a combat force with high political awareness and high organizational discipline, becoming a reliable reserve force for the People's Liberation Army."

The revolutionary students in the capital spoke at the meeting, expressing warm welcome to the revolutionary comrades from all over the country.

Revolutionary students from the East China, Northeast, North China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest regions spoke at the meeting. They said:

"We have come to the side of our beloved leader Chairman Mao and feel extremely happy. We are here to learn from the Red Guards in the capital and to seek guidance. We are determined to bring back the fearless revolutionary spirit of the capital's Red Guards—daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, dare to break through, and dare to revolutionize—to let the revolutionary flames of Mao Zedong Thought burn throughout China." The revolutionary students said:

"With the great helmsman Chairman Mao steering us, and the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought illuminating our path forward, we fear nothing. We have full confidence and determination to create a brand-new world with our own hands. Through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will uproot the roots of revisionism in our country and ensure that our beloved motherland remains forever red!"

"The flag of the Red Guards is red, the armbands are red, and our hearts are red! We are loyal and will forever follow the Party and Chairman Mao to revolutionize to the end!"

"We Red Guards listen to Chairman Mao the most. We must strive to learn from the People's Liberation Army. We must earnestly study the Sixteen Points, be familiar with the Sixteen Points, apply the Sixteen Points, insist on cultural struggle, and not physical struggle, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

As night fell, the Tiananmen Gate and the surrounding buildings were brightly lit. Chairman Mao, amid the cheers of the masses, walked to both ends of the Tiananmen Gate and once again waved to the crowd. Shouts of "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the night sky of the capital.

    今天，天安门广场上，无数面红旗迎风招展。千万个佩戴着红袖章的红卫兵，捧着红色封面的《毛主席语录》，高唱着《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲。整个广场汇成欢腾的红色海洋。
