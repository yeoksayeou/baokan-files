The Congolese (Brazzaville) National Assembly President Muya Bi Andrè Georges said at a banquet hosted by Hunan Vice Governor Xu Ming this evening, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people, but also the sun of the progressive people of the world."

Muya Bi Andrè Georges and his wife, along with the Congolese (Brazzaville) parliamentary delegation led by Muya Bi, arrived in Changsha by plane from Nanjing yesterday. That day, the guests visited the former residence of Chairman Mao in Xiangtan Shaoshan. Today, they visited the Hunan Provincial First Normal School and Qing Shui Tang, where Chairman Mao engaged in early revolutionary activities. In the evening, the guests attended a welcome banquet hosted by Hunan Vice Governor Xu Ming.

When the guests visited Shaoshan yesterday, Muya Bi Andrè Georges wrote in the guest book, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao Zedong. He said, "Because of Chairman Mao Zedong—only he grasps the key to the 20th century world, because of his outstanding thoughts on the process of building socialism, our world can look forward to the future with greater optimism." He said, Chairman Mao Zedong is a "person with outstanding and everlasting thoughts."

The guests were very enthusiastic about visiting Shaoshan. Muya Bi said, "Shaoshan—it is not only meaningful to the Chinese people, but also to the people of the world." During their flight from Nanjing to Changsha, some guests asked the translator to help them study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," while others said, "I will take the translated 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' back home to study and actively promote it."

The guests received a warm welcome from the people of Shaoshan and workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards from various places.

In front of the former residence of Chairman Mao, the guests and the welcoming Red Guards held hands and took a group photo. A group of Red Guards and young students presented the guests with portraits of Chairman Mao.

After the visit, the Congolese (Brazzaville) guests eagerly bought statues of Chairman Mao at the Shaoshan store. One guest, holding a newly purchased statue of Chairman Mao, excitedly said, "I will take the statue of Chairman Mao back to place it on my desk to show my love for Chairman Mao."

In the exhibition hall of Chairman Mao's former residence, the guests saw the spears and lances used by the Chinese people during the First Civil War. The guide explained that these simple weapons, when in the hands of the people, have unlimited power and can smash the old world and create a new one. The guests were very interested and said, "I will take everything I saw in China back home to tell the people." Muya Bi said:

"I agree with Chairman Mao's statement that imperialism is a paper tiger. It looks strong and has a big belly, but in reality, it can be blown away by a gust of wind." "We are determined to persist in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States."

    刚果（布）议会代表团访问韶山热烈赞扬毛泽东思想
    毛主席使我们乐观地展望未来
    据新华社长沙十日电　刚果（布）国民议会议长穆亚比·安德烈·乔治今晚在湖南省副省长徐明举行的宴会上说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界进步人类的太阳。”
    穆亚比·安德烈·乔治议长和夫人以及由穆亚比议长率领的刚果（布）议会代表团是在昨天乘飞机从南京到达长沙的。当天，贵宾们参观了湘潭韶山毛主席旧居，今天又参观了毛主席早年革命活动纪念地湖南省第一师范学校和清水塘等地。晚上，贵宾们出席了湖南省副省长徐明举行的欢迎宴会。
    贵宾们昨天到韶山进行参观的时候，穆亚比·安德烈·乔治议长在留言簿上留言，热情赞扬毛泽东主席。他说：“由于有了毛泽东主席——唯有他掌握了我们二十世纪世界的关键所在，由于他对建设社会主义过程所提出的杰出的思想，我们的世界可以更加乐观地展望未来。”他说，毛泽东主席是一位“拥有杰出而万古长青的思想的人物。”
    贵宾们对来到韶山访问怀着极大的热情。穆亚比议长说：“韶山——不仅对中国人民有意义，而且对世界人民有意义。”昨天从南京乘专机来长沙途中，客人们有的在飞机上就请翻译帮助他们学习《毛主席语录》，有的说：“我要把译好的《毛主席语录》带回国去好好学习，积极宣传。”
    贵宾在韶山受到了韶山人民和各地来的工农兵群众以及红卫兵的热烈欢迎。
    在毛主席旧居门前，贵宾们和欢迎他们的红卫兵们，手挽着手一起合影留念。一批红卫兵和青年学生向贵宾们赠送了毛主席的画像。
    参观结束后，刚果（布）贵宾在韶山商店里争着购买毛主席的塑像。一位贵宾拿着新买的毛主席塑像，兴奋地说：“我要把毛主席像带回去放在办公桌上，让我表示对毛主席的热爱。”
    在毛主席旧居陈列馆里，贵宾们看到中国人民在第一次国内革命战争时期使用过的梭镖和长矛。讲解员向他们介绍说，这些简陋的武器只要掌握在人民手里，就有无穷的威力，就可以打烂旧世界，创出新江山。贵宾们听了很感兴趣，有的说：“我要把我在中国看到的一切带回去，告诉国内人民。”穆亚比议长说：
  “我同意毛泽东主席的论断，帝国主义是纸老虎，看样子强大，肚子很大，实际上一阵风就把它吹凹了。”“我们有决心进行坚持不懈的反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争。”
