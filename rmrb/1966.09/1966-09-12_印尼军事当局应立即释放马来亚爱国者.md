Sharma, Head of the Delegation, Writes to the Indonesian Ambassador to China

The Indonesian military authorities should immediately release Malaysian patriots.

We, the Asian-African Solidarity Committee, strongly condemn the mad persecution by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.

The Vietnam Asian-African Solidarity Organization demands that the Indonesian authorities immediately restore the freedom of Malaysian patriots.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, Sharma, the head of the delegation of the Malaysian National Liberation League stationed in China, wrote a letter to the Indonesian Ambassador to China yesterday, strongly demanding that the Indonesian military authorities immediately stop the persecution of the four members of the Malaysian National Liberation League delegation stationed in Indonesia, and take immediate measures to ensure their safety and allow them to leave Indonesia for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Sharma, the head of the delegation, published this letter today. In the letter, he requested the ambassador to convey the urgent appeal of the Central Committee of the Malaysian National Liberation League on August 15th to the relevant Indonesian authorities.

Sharma revealed in the letter that the Indonesian military authorities openly discussed handing over the four members of the delegation to the reactionary Rahman group of the new colonialism "Malaysia." The letter pointed out that the four members of the delegation firmly protested against their continued and illegal detention and demanded their immediate release.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee issued a statement today saying that the Chinese people strongly condemn the persecution of the four members of the Malaysian National Liberation League delegation stationed in Indonesia by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. The statement fully supports the urgent appeal issued by the Central Committee of the Malaysian National Liberation League on August 15, 1966. The statement pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary military authorities must immediately stop the unreasonable persecution of the four members of this delegation, unconditionally release them, and respect their wish to leave Indonesia and go to any country they choose. Otherwise, the Indonesian reactionary military authorities will never escape the responsibility of destroying the friendship between the Malaysian people and the Indonesian people and the anti-imperialist cause of Asian-African people's solidarity.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 10th, the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee issued a statement on the 9th, protesting against the continued detention and torture of members of the Malaysian National Liberation League delegation stationed in Indonesia by the Indonesian authorities.

The statement firmly demands that the Indonesian authorities immediately stop the persecution of Malaysian patriots, restore the delegation's freedom, and fully guarantee that the delegation can move to other places of their own choosing, without obstruction.
