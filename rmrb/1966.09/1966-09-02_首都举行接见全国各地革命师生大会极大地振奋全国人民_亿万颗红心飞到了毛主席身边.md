The capital held a reception for revolutionary students and teachers from across the nation, greatly inspiring the people of the nation. Billions of red hearts flew to the side of Chairman Mao.

The joyous news that our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao received revolutionary students and teachers from across the nation in the capital has spread like a spring breeze throughout the country. Billions of Red Guards, revolutionary students, and workers and peasants enthusiastically cheered, saying that Chairman Mao's reception of the Red Guards and revolutionary students in the new high tide of the Cultural Revolution is the greatest support and encouragement for the revolutionary masses across the nation.

Revolutionary masses in various places, filled with revolutionary fervor, expressed their determination to resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, respond to the call made by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai at the rally, take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for the Cultural Revolution, learn from the PLA, and thoroughly, completely, and without any deviation implement the Sixteen Points. They vowed to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

In the capital, the broad masses of Red Guards, revolutionary students, workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres were overjoyed and spread the good news. Some Red Guards from Peking University who participated in the rally yesterday said, "Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary students from across the nation who came to Beijing is a great impetus to the current Cultural Revolution. Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai's speeches have further clarified the direction of the current Cultural Revolution for us. We Red Guards must take the PLA as our example, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the Cultural Revolution, we must study the Sixteen Points well and implement them well, be bold, learn to revolutionize in the revolution, and complete the glorious and magnificent tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation."

Many workers at the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory cheered enthusiastically after hearing the live broadcast of the rally: "The situation of the Cultural Revolution is excellent! The actions of the revolutionary successors are excellent! Some workers said, "The Sixteen Points are the latest development of Mao Zedong Thought. If we carry out the revolution according to this great guideline, we will definitely achieve complete victory."

In Guangzhou, after listening to the broadcast, the Red Guards and revolutionary students formed one team after another to march in the streets, with cheers and slogans shaking the entire city. The Red Guards of Sun Yat-sen University said, "Chairman Mao is our great commander-in-chief. We will absolutely follow Chairman Mao's words. We will not disappoint the great commander-in-chief's teachings and will definitely forge the Red Guards into a genuine fighting force armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with high political awareness and high organizational discipline."

The revolutionary students and teachers of the South China Institute of Technology expressed that Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Zhou Enlai's speeches not only gave them great encouragement but also provided them with new weapons for the struggle. They said, "We will definitely act according to the Sixteen Points, insist on struggle through criticism, and overthrow, smash, and expose all those in power who are taking the capitalist road and all monsters and demons, making them lose all their prestige."

The news reached Shenyang, and the city was once again immersed in a festive atmosphere. This afternoon, teams composed of revolutionary students, workers, and revolutionary cadres marched through the streets. Instantly, the main streets of the city became a sea of red flags, with drumbeats and slogans echoing throughout the city. Shenyang Pharmaceutical College held a rally before the march, and all revolutionary students and staff expressed their determination to take Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, learn from the PLA, act according to the Sixteen Points, insist on struggle through criticism, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. Some revolutionary students from Shenyang's August 18th Red School (formerly the 29th Middle School) said excitedly, "Our beloved Chairman Mao once again received revolutionary students from across the nation who came to Beijing. This is a great trust in us and the greatest happiness for the revolutionary masses across the nation. We will definitely become the main force of the Cultural Revolution and the vanguard of the revolution."

In Wuhan, tens of thousands of workers, revolutionary students, Red Guards, and office staff marched through the streets this morning, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao and banners reading "Warmly welcome Chairman Mao's reception of revolutionary student representatives coming to Beijing." The Red Guards of Hubei Provincial Yurong Normal School expressed their determination to learn from the PLA, study Mao Zedong's works actively, and focus on the "use" of Chairman Mao's teachings. They vowed to study, understand, propagate, master, and apply the Sixteen Points, strictly observe the three main disciplines and eight points for attention, carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and become vanguards of the revolution, following the great leader Chairman Mao in the great waves of revolution.

All revolutionary students of Hubei University held a grand rally this morning, where the rally read the telegram sent by the representatives who went to Beijing. When it mentioned, "Chairman Mao's health is very good," the entire audience was extremely excited and raised their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," cheering, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Some Red Guards from various schools in Tianjin participated in the rally in the capital yesterday and happily saw the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao. They returned to their schools overnight with excited hearts to share the good news with all revolutionary students. The Red Guards of Dongfanghong Military School decided to summarize the experiences of the previous stage of struggle, further improve their political and ideological level and combat effectiveness, and strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the Red Guards. They said, "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee expect us to become a force with high organizational discipline and combat effectiveness, a reliable reserve force for the PLA. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the PLA, and become Red Guards who are worthy of the great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, forever serving the people faithfully."

In Chengdu, many Red Guards and revolutionary students of Sichuan University listened to the live broadcast while flipping through the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait on the first page for a long time, and shed tears of excitement. They cheered repeatedly, "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They said, "Chairman Mao received revolutionary students from outside who came to Beijing, as if we ourselves were by Chairman Mao's side. Please rest assured, Chairman Mao, no matter how great the black winds and evil waves are, we will definitely act according to your instructions and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end." The revolutionary students of Southwest Nationalities Institute, after listening to the broadcast, immediately restudied the Sixteen Points. Many revolutionary students and Red Guards expressed their determination to resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, study Mao Zedong's works, learn from the PLA, thoroughly, completely, and without any deviation implement the Sixteen Points, and strive to forge themselves into brave and intelligent revolutionary fighters.

The broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary students in Nanjing, after hearing the news, became even more determined to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. They said, "Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in our hearts. The sea may dry up, and the rocks may crumble, but our hearts to follow Chairman Mao in the revolution will never change." After hearing the live broadcast of Chairman Mao appearing before the Red Guards at Tiananmen Square, the revolutionary students of Nanjing Forestry College immediately erupted in cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Some students were so happy that they shed tears, and their thousands of hearts had long flown to Chairman Mao's side. Five Red Guards from the affiliated middle school of Nanjing Normal University, who had seen Chairman Mao, were especially happy today, as if they were back in Beijing. They said, "Our armbands are red, and our hearts are red. Our hearts are with our supreme commander Chairman Mao. We have long made up our minds to sweep away all harmful creatures and let Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout China and the world."

In Urumqi, many Red Guards, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses held celebratory rallies, and some carried giant portraits of Chairman Mao to hold celebratory parades. The Red Guards of the Eighth Middle School in Urumqi, after hearing the good news, took their "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the Sixteen Points to the streets to propagate. They expressed their determination to thoroughly, completely, and without any deviation implement the Sixteen Points, overcome all difficulties, and push the Cultural Revolution to a new high tide.
