A Vivid and Profound Education in Mao Zedong Thought
Red Guards and PLA Soldiers Together Go to the Countryside to Support Autumn Harvest

According to Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 11th: Over 5,000 Red Guards from colleges and universities in Chongqing, along with soldiers from the stationed People's Liberation Army (PLA), went to the suburban countryside to support the autumn harvest. During their labor, they humbly learned from the PLA soldiers and poor and lower-middle peasants, receiving a vivid and profound education in Mao Zedong Thought.

On the morning of the 9th, a labor force of over 5,000 Red Guards from more than 30 colleges and universities set out in a grand procession towards four suburban people's communes. They carried portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations, holding high banners that read "Carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end," "Grasp revolution, promote production," "Learn from the PLA," "Learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants," and carrying hoes and shoulder poles, drumming and singing, marching in high spirits behind the PLA's ranks.

Upon arriving at the communes, the Red Guards immediately rushed to the fields to work side by side with the PLA soldiers and commune members. The PLA soldiers, in their labor, took on the heaviest tasks and worked meticulously, setting a good example for the young Red Guards. Many Red Guards said: The most important thing for us to learn from the PLA is to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, serving the people wholeheartedly and forever being the people's servants.

The young revolutionaries saw during their labor that the poor and lower-middle peasants were diligent and brave, full of enthusiasm, and devoted to farming for the revolution, which greatly inspired and educated them. Many Red Guards used their rest time to visit the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants, asking them to share their family and village histories. The young revolutionaries excitedly said, "We must never forget our class bitterness, always remember our blood debts, and forever remember that we are the sons of the working people, raised by the blood and sweat of the working people."

    一次生动深刻的毛泽东思想教育
    重庆红卫兵和解放军一道下乡支援秋收
    据新华社重庆十一日电重庆市大中学校五千多名红卫兵和解放军驻军指战员一道下乡支援郊区农村秋收。他们在劳动中虚心向解放军和贫农下中农学习，受到了一次生动深刻的毛泽东思想教育。
    九日一早，由三十多所大中学校五千多名红卫兵组成的劳动大军，便浩浩荡荡开赴四个郊区人民公社。他们抬着伟大领袖毛主席的画像和毛主席语录牌，高举着“将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”
  “抓革命，促生产”“向解放军学习”“向贫农下中农学习”等标语，扛着锄头、扁担，敲锣打鼓，英姿焕发地紧紧跟着解放军的队伍前进。
    红卫兵们到达公社后，立即奔向田间，同解放军指战员和公社社员们并肩劳动。解放军在劳动中争挑重担，干活一丝不苟，成为红卫兵小将们学习的好榜样。许多红卫兵说：我们学习解放军，最重要的就是要像解放军那样读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，全心全意为人民服务，永远做人民的勤务员。
    革命小将们在劳动中看到贫农下中农勤劳勇敢，干劲冲天，一心为革命种田，受到很大的教育和鼓舞。许多红卫兵利用休息时间，登门拜访贫农下中农，请他们讲家史、村史。小将们激动地说，我们一定不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，永远记住我们是劳动人民的儿子，是劳动人民的血汗把我们养大的。
