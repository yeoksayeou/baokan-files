The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is powerfully promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking and driving the great development of production. In the first eight months of this year, despite having to allocate personnel and equipment to support other factories, Shanxi Machinery Factory has completed nearly double the production tasks of the same period last year. Labor productivity and profits turned over to the state have both significantly increased compared to the same period last year. The rate of first-class products has increased by 30 percent compared to the same period last year.
