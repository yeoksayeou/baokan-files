Chairman Mao, in his directive of December 1963, criticized many Communist Party members for enthusiastically promoting feudalist and capitalist art, but not enthusiastically promoting socialist art. Lin Mo-han refused to carry out this important directive. He repeatedly advocated that one cannot say that only today's life is reflected in socialist literature. He even said that if only writing about today's life is considered socialist literature, then it is "too narrow." This is how he blatantly opposed the idea that socialist literature must reflect socialist life, openly contradicting Chairman Mao's directive.

In 1963, the leading comrades of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party, based on Comrade Kao Ching-shih's directive to "write thirteen years" (i.e., extensively write about socialism), proposed ten advantages of writing about the thirteen years. Lin Mo-han was very displeased with this. He said more than once: "Socialist literature is not just about reflecting socialist life." He also mockingly said that if one were to find twenty advantages, one could also find them. He further attacked, saying that this is "not understanding art."

In early 1964, the East China region held a drama festival, performing many modern plays. Lin Mo-han attempted to dismiss these modern plays with a single stroke. He ridiculed some of the plays' heroic characters as self-proclaimed and unnatural; he said some plays had policy issues; he slandered the audience for being educated and moved to tears by the plays, saying "some people just love to cry."

Why did Lin Mo-han so fiercely oppose "writing thirteen years" and performing modern plays? The main reason is that Comrade Kao Ching-shih held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line, and vigorously promoted the arts reflecting socialism. Lin Mo-han's opposition to "writing thirteen years" was aimed at attempting to make the arts deviate from the Party's leadership and the path of Mao Zedong Thought, turning socialist literature into a tool for restoring capitalism.

    反对“写十三年”的实质
    毛主席在一九六三年十二月的批示中，批评许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术。林默涵对于这个重要的指示拒不执行。他多次地宣扬，不能认为只有今天才有社会主义文艺。还说，如果只有写今天生活的才是社会主义文艺，那就“太狭窄”了。他就是这样明目张胆地反对社会主义文艺必须反映社会主义生活，公开与毛主席的指示唱反调。
    一九六三年，中共上海市委的领导同志，根据柯庆施同志提出的“写十三年”（即大写社会主义）的指示，提出文艺“写十三年”的十条好处。林默涵对此十分反感，他不止一次地说：“社会主义文学不等于只要反映社会主义生活”，并极力讥笑“写十三年”的主张，说什么“要找二十条好处也能找”。还攻击说这是“不懂文艺”。
    一九六四年初，华东举行话剧汇演，大演现代戏。林默涵企图把这些现代剧目一棍子打死。他挖苦有些剧中的英雄人物是自封的，很不自然；有些剧目有政策问题；污蔑观众看了戏受到教育，感动得落了泪是“有人就爱流泪”。
    林默涵为什么这样疯狂地反对“写十三年”，反对演现代戏呢？主要是因为柯庆施同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行了毛主席的工农兵文艺路线，大抓文艺表现社会主义。林默涵反对“写十三年”，其罪恶目的就是妄想使文艺脱离党的领导，脱离毛泽东思想的轨道，使社会主义文艺变为复辟资本主义的工具。
