	Red Guards, hearts aflame,
	Always follow Chairman Mao.
	The Sixteen Points are our guidelines,
	Mao Zedong Thought is our beacon.
	Smash the "Four Olds" as pioneers,
	Establish the "Four News" as vanguards.
	Raise high the banner of revolution,
	Sweep away all monsters and demons.
	Red Guards, hearts aflame,
	Always follow Chairman Mao.
	Hold fast to the spirit of the Sixteen Points,
	Forge ahead in stormy seas.
	Through mud and waves we march,
	With "Selected Works of Mao" in hand, we press on!
	Our hearts forever turn to the sun,
	We vow to be Chairman Mao's Red Guards!

    红卫兵歌
    赵金福红卫兵，心最红，永远跟着毛泽东。十六条决定是纲领，毛泽东思想是指路灯。破除“四旧”当闯将，大立“四新”作先锋。高举革命的造反旗，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。红卫兵，心最红，永远跟着毛泽东。十六条精神掌握紧，大风浪里铸钢筋。泥里滚，浪里行，手捧《毛选》向前进！红心永远向太阳，誓作毛主席的红卫兵！
