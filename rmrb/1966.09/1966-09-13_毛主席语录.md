	The two major movements of rectification and production, which began in 1942 and 1943 respectively, have played and are playing a decisive role in the spiritual and material lives of the people. If we do not seize these two links at the appropriate time, we will not be able to grasp the entire chain of the revolution, and our struggle will not be able to continue to advance.

    毛主席语录
    一九四二和一九四三两年先后开始的带普遍性的整风运动和生产运动，曾经分别地在精神生活方面和物质生活方面起了和正在起着决定性的作用。这两个环子，如果不在适当的时机抓住它们，我们就无法抓住整个的革命链条，而我们的斗争也就不能继续前进。
