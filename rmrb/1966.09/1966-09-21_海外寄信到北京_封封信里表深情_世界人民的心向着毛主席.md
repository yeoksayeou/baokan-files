My Heart Is with Beijing

When I received a woven portrait of Chairman Mao, my joy was indescribable. I had long wished to obtain a portrait of Chairman Mao. This dream has finally come true, filling my heart with happiness and keeping me awake with excitement all night.

Our family is deeply moved by the leadership of the People's Republic of China under Chairman Mao Zedong and by the revolutionary spirit and indomitable will of the Chinese people. Our hearts are with Beijing.

The day will surely come when we will engage in a life-and-death struggle with the enemy. Our family regards sacrifices on the revolutionary path as the ultimate happiness and the highest honor. This is our resolve.

I Always Remember Chairman Mao's Teachings

Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest revolutionary leader of the world's revolutionary people and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The world's people have great fortune in having Comrade Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong Thought not only guides the revolution and construction in China but also serves as the guiding ideology for the world's people in their struggle against imperialism and its lackeys and in their national liberation movements to achieve victory.

The American imperialists are the common enemy of the people of China and Korea. To dedicate my strength to the cause of national liberation, I am willing to sacrifice everything, even my life. Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "For the people's interests, to die is weightier than Mount Tai; for the reactionaries' interests, to die is lighter than a feather." I will always remember this teaching.

Chairman Mao's Works Are Our Guide

Chairman Mao is a revolutionary genius. Mao Zedong Thought breaks through all difficulties and marches forward unceasingly. The people of the whole world are united with Mao Zedong. We pay tribute to Chairman Mao—the savior of the world's people—and to Chairman Mao who raises the banner against revisionism! Chairman Mao's works are our guide and will also be the guide for our future generations!

Chairman Mao's Books Are Always with Me

We have a beloved leader who leads the world's national liberation movement in the direction of socialism. He is the leader of the Chinese people—Chairman Mao.

I hope to obtain a book written by Chairman Mao—the defender of truth, the trustworthy person, and the supporter of all oppressed peoples in the world. I want Chairman Mao's book because I greatly admire him. I swear that from today on, apart from Chairman Mao's book, there will be nothing else that I will always keep by my side. This is what I like to do most.

Chairman Mao has shown us the way to human happiness.

    我的心向着北京
    当我得到一幅毛主席像的织锦时，喜悦的心情绝非笔墨所能形容。我是多么希望能够得到一幅毛主席的绣像！这个梦想终于实现了，心中充满了幸福感，兴奋的心情使我彻夜不能入睡。
    我们一家对于以毛泽东主席为首的中华人民共和国的领导人及中国人民的革命精神和冲天气概，深受感动。我们的心向着北京。

    我时刻记住毛主席的教导
    毛泽东主席是世界革命人民的最伟大的革命导师，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。世界人民有了毛泽东同志，是莫大的幸福。毛泽东思想不仅是指引中国革命与建设的思想，而且是全世界人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的斗争和民族解放事业取得胜利的指导思想。
    美帝国主义是老中两国人民不共戴天的共同敌人。为了把自己的力量献于民族解放事业，我甘愿牺牲自己的一切甚至自己的生命。毛泽东主席在《为人民服务》中说：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重；替法西斯卖力，替剥削人民和压迫人民的人去死，就比鸿毛还轻。”我将时时刻刻记住这一教导。

    毛主席著作是我们的向导
    毛主席是革命的天才。毛泽东思想冲破一切困难不断前进。全世界人民和毛泽东一条心。向毛主席——世界人民的救星致敬，向高举反修旗帜的毛主席致敬。毛主席著作是我们的向导，也将是我们后代的向导！

    毛主席的书永不离身
    我们有着受人爱戴的领袖，遵循社会主义方向的世界民族解放运动的领袖，他就是中国人民的领袖——毛主席。
    我希望得到一本毛主席——维护真理的人，可信赖的人，支持世界所有被压迫的人民的人——写的书。我之所以要毛主席的书，是因为我非常崇敬他。我起誓，从今天起，除了毛主席的书，我再没有其它形影不离的东西了。这是我最喜欢做的事情。
    毛主席给我们指出的道路，是一条使人类通向幸福的道路。
