We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and use struggle sessions, not physical struggle. Do not resort to violence. In struggling against those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and against landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, the same principle applies. Physical struggle can only affect the surface, while struggle sessions can touch the soul.

Use Struggle Sessions, Not Physical Struggle

Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly told us that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches people's souls. He also said that to achieve this revolution, we must use struggle sessions, not physical struggle.

By "people's souls," we mean their thoughts, their ideology, their cultural norms, and the various customs and habits associated with people's thoughts and ideology. These are all issues in people's minds.

Since this is the case, the proletariat must use struggle sessions to solve these issues in people's minds when remolding the world in their own image. The same applies to struggling against those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and against landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

Comrade Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee advocate the use of big-character posters, big debates, and big discussions during the Cultural Revolution. All of these involve writing and speaking.

Writing and speaking require thinking, encouraging the masses to exercise their creativity, wisdom, and talent.

The simple method of physical struggle can only affect the surface, not the soul. It cannot fully expose the ugly faces of the ghosts and monsters in front of the masses, nor can it eliminate the reactionary poison of these ghosts and monsters.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and monsters must be criticized." "But this criticism must be fully reasoned, analytical, and persuasive." This means using one's brain, using struggle sessions.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, learning to use struggle sessions and learning to think is a big deal.

Comrade Mao Zedong has always told revolutionaries to use their brains. He pointed out: "We must advocate thinking, learn the method of analyzing things, and cultivate the habit of analysis." This instruction from Comrade Mao Zedong is also very important for our current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We know that the enemy will not forgive the people. We advocate struggle sessions not to forgive the enemy's evil activities, but to truly defeat the people's enemies politically and ideologically, to make them lose all their prestige and never be able to rise again. This is to expose everything about the ghosts and monsters, to use these negative examples to educate the masses and the younger generation. Only in this way can we greatly raise the class consciousness of the broad masses, unite as many people as possible, and isolate the enemies of the proletariat and the people to the greatest extent. This method of struggle sessions is what the enemies of the proletariat and the people fear the most.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. To achieve victory in this revolution, the vanguard of the proletariat must learn and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's works and the Sixteen Points in the struggle, learning how to wage class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The enemies of the people will not voluntarily leave the historical stage. We advocate struggle sessions because we rely on the masses, trust the masses, because the truth is in the hands of the proletariat, and believe that the method of struggle sessions is sufficient to subdue the enemy. At the same time, the powerful state machine is in the hands of the proletariat, and we are not afraid of the enemies of the people causing trouble. If the enemy dares to use force and violate the criminal law of the proletarian dictatorship, we will resolutely punish them according to the law.

Using struggle sessions, not physical struggle, is an important policy of the Party in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must adhere to this policy and implement it.

### 用文斗，不用武斗

    我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，要用文斗，不用武斗。不要动手打人。斗争那些走资本主义道路的当权派，斗争那些地、富、反、坏、右分子，也是这样。武斗只能触及皮肉，文斗才能触其灵魂。
    用文斗，不用武斗
    毛泽东同志反复地告诉我们，无产阶级文化大革命是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。又说，实现这一场大革命，要用文斗，不用武斗。
    所谓人们的灵魂，就是说的思想，说的意识形态，说的社会风行的文化，说的同人们的思想、意识形态相联系的种种风俗、种种习惯。这些，都是人们头脑里的问题。
    既然是这样，无产阶级按照自己的面貌改造世界，就必须用文斗，来解决人们头脑里的这些问题。斗争那些走资本主义道路的当权派，斗争那些地、富、反、坏、右分子，也是这样。
    毛泽东同志和党中央，提倡在文化大革命中，要充分利用大字报，进行大辩论，大鸣大放。这些都要动笔，动口。
    动口，动笔，就必须动脑筋，让群众去发挥自己的创造性，发挥自己的智慧和天才。
    用武斗的简单办法，只能触及皮肉，不能触及灵魂，不能在群众面前充分暴露那些牛鬼蛇神的丑恶面貌，不能肃清那些牛鬼蛇神的反动毒素。
    毛泽东同志说：“凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判”。“但是，这种批判，应该是充分说理的，有分析的，有说服力的”。这就是说，要用脑筋，要用文斗。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，学会文斗，学会动脑筋，这是一件大事。
    毛泽东同志历来告诉革命的人们，要善于用脑筋。他指出：“必须提倡思索，学会分析事物的方法，养成分析的习惯。”毛泽东同志这个指示，对我们当前的无产阶级文化大革命说来，同样是非常重要的。
    我们知道，敌人对人民是不会宽恕的。我们提倡文斗，不是要宽恕敌人的罪恶活动，而是为了真正从政治上、思想上把人民的敌人彻底斗倒，斗垮，斗臭，使他们威风扫地，永世不得翻身。
    文斗，就是要充分揭露，深刻批判，把一切牛鬼蛇神的反动言行摆在光天化日之下，用这些反面教材，来教育群众，教育年轻的一代。这样，才能大大提高广大群众的阶级觉悟，团结一切可以团结的人，把无产阶级的敌人，人民的敌人最大限度地孤立起来。这种文斗的办法，是无产阶级的敌人，人民的敌人所最害怕的。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场极其尖锐、极其复杂的阶级斗争。要取得这个革命的胜利，无产阶级的先锋队伍，必须在斗争中，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，活学活用十六条，学会在无产阶级专政条件下进行阶级斗争的本领。
    人民的敌人是不会自动退出历史舞台的。我们主张文斗，是因为我们依靠群众，信任群众，是因为真理掌握在无产阶级的手里，相信用文斗的办法足以制服敌人。同时，强大的国家机器掌握在无产阶级手里，我们不怕人民的敌人捣乱。如果敌人胆敢动武，触犯无产阶级专政的刑律，那就坚决依法制裁。
    用文斗，不用武斗，这是党在无产阶级文化大革命中的一项重要政策。我们一定要坚持这个政策，贯彻执行这个政策。
