The People's Liberation Army is the propaganda team and the seed planter of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Beijing Military Region's 10,000-person propaganda team enters the earthquake-stricken areas of Xingtai to spread Mao Zedong Thought to every village and town.

The people of Xingtai actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, greatly enhancing their heroic spirit of fighting against natural disasters and achieving good harvests in both summer and autumn.

XINGTAI, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) — The People's Liberation Army's Beijing Military Region unit, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that the army is both a fighting force and a working force, organized a 10,000-person propaganda team in April and May this year. With great enthusiasm, they propagated Mao Zedong Thought among the people of the severely earthquake-stricken areas of Hebei Province's Xingtai region, inspiring the local people with high morale and vigorous spirit. The people are now actively restoring production and rebuilding their homes, creating a prosperous scene.

In March, when the Xingtai region suffered a severe earthquake, this unit, along with other units, immediately rushed to the front lines of disaster relief, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. While rescuing the lives and property of the people, they continuously used Mao Zedong Thought to raise the class consciousness of the people, helping them build confidence and determination to overcome the disaster. In early April, Premier Zhou Enlai instructed them to vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, to be good propagandists and seed planters of Mao Zedong Thought, arming the people with Mao Zedong Thought, and planting deep roots of Mao Zedong Thought.

When Premier Zhou's instructions reached the troops, the morale soared, and the soldiers enthusiastically wrote letters of determination and guarantees, volunteering to go to the most arduous places to carry out this most glorious political mission. Under the unified leadership of the local party committee, a 10,000-strong Mao Zedong Thought propaganda army was formed, dividing into hundreds of smaller teams. Like the old Eighth Route Army, they packed their bags, carried dry rations, brought Chairman Mao's works, held up quotations, braved wind and rain, climbed mountains and crossed rivers, heading towards every village and town in the Xingtai region.

The soldiers, with deep proletarian feelings, propagated Mao Zedong Thought among the people. They never let go of Chairman Mao's books, never stopped speaking Chairman Mao's words, never strayed from Chairman Mao's thoughts, and never deviated from Chairman Mao's instructions in their actions. Wherever they went, they visited the poor and asked about their hardships, read Chairman Mao's books to the masses, explained Chairman Mao's teachings, and inspired everyone to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions with deep proletarian feelings. During the propaganda, the soldiers also set an example by serving the people completely and thoroughly, taking the lead in labor, being pioneers, and stepping forward in times of danger to rescue people's lives and property. This "silent propaganda" taught the masses the living Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "Following Chairman Mao's instructions and learning from the PLA, we can't go wrong!"

Once the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it immediately generates boundless power, transforming people's spiritual faces. Many community members, after learning "In Memory of Norman Bethune," immediately put aside personal interests for the collective, dedicating themselves to the collective; after learning "Serve the People," they immediately selflessly helped others and did good deeds; after learning "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," they immediately enhanced their heroic spirit of fighting against nature. Some community members, who were once discouraged by the severe disaster, stood up and said, "The house may collapse, but our spirits will not! The earth may shake, but our hearts will not waver! Following Chairman Mao's words, we fear neither knife-edges nor fire pits, and we are not afraid of the sky falling or the earth collapsing!" They immediately stood up with renewed vigor to fight against the severe natural disasters. Some leaders with fear of difficulties woke up and decided, "Determine to hold the reins for the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionize to the end!" Women, after hearing Chairman Mao's words, actively went to the fields to work, and youth, after hearing Chairman Mao's words, had even greater revolutionary spirit. People said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the all-powerful golden key that can open any lock. Chairman Mao's book is written for us poor people. Chairman Mao's words, we will listen to them a hundred times, believe them a hundred times, and act on them a hundred times!"

Under the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Xingtai region has undergone earth-shaking changes. The masses said, "People change, the land changes," "People change, the land changes, the villages change, people are new, the land is new, the villages are new." They generally reflected that the countryside has undergone "eight major changes": First, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works has become a trend, with every village and every place discussing and learning; second, the class consciousness of loving the collective and walking the socialist path has greatly improved, with everyone wanting to farm for the revolution and be revolutionary farmers; third, the spirit of self-reliance has been greatly promoted, with every village and team expressing that they do not rely on the land, do not rely on the heavens, but rely entirely on the heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought; fourth, superstitions have been broken, thoughts have been liberated, and thousand-year-old outdated customs have been swept away; fifth, women actively go to the fields to work, study politics, and engage in production, shouldering half the sky; sixth, the political and ideological work level of rural cadres has greatly improved, understanding that "among a thousand rules, learning Chairman Mao's works is the first rule, among a thousand tasks, emphasizing politics is the first task"; seventh, rural cultural activities have become more lively, reading revolutionary books, singing revolutionary songs, and performing revolutionary plays, sweeping away old ideas and old culture; eighth, the spirit of selflessness and dedication has blossomed everywhere, with more and more good people and good deeds.

The victory on the ideological frontline was followed by a victory on the production frontline. A socialist production high tide has formed here. In just half a year, they not only basically healed the wounds caused by the earthquake disaster but also overcame the drought and achieved a good summer harvest, followed by an even more bountiful autumn harvest. Many communes located in the earthquake center also carried out many basic farmland construction projects, built water conservancy facilities, transformed saline-alkali lands, reclaimed river beaches and barren slopes, and increased grain production across the board. The surplus grain teams became even richer, and the deficit grain teams leaped to become surplus grain teams. The people proudly said, "We have Mao Zedong Thought in our hearts, enemies in our eyes, weapons in our hands, and grain in our warehouses. What natural disasters, calamities, demons, and ghosts, none of them are a problem!"

Propagating to the masses and educating oneself. While propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the people, this unit also received profound education. The deep love of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants for Chairman Mao prompted the soldiers to be more conscious of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works; the class struggle in the countryside gave the broad soldiers a most profound and practical class education; the vivid facts of the people's love for the children of the soldiers further solidified the soldiers' thoughts of wholeheartedly serving the people; the broad community members' hardworking and simple style also prompted the broad soldiers to decide to carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle. They said: the countryside is a vast world, everywhere is a classroom, everything is an education, the poor and lower-middle peasants are good teachers, class struggle is a living textbook, and they have had a lifelong unforgettable lesson. They all expressed that they would be more conscious of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, go to the masses, go to practice, and forever be good propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

    手不离毛主席的书，嘴不离毛主席的话，心不离毛主席的思想，行动不离毛主席的教导
    解放军是毛泽东思想的宣传队和播种机
    北京部队万人宣传队深入邢台地震灾区把毛泽东思想传播到每个村镇
    邢台人民活学活用毛主席著作大长战天斗地英雄气概连夺夏秋好收成
    新华社邢台二十三日电　中国人民解放军北京部队某部，在毛主席关于我军既是战斗队又是工作队光辉思想的指导下，今年四五月间，组成万人宣传队，满腔热情地向遭受严重地震灾害的河北邢台地区群众宣传毛泽东思想，使灾区人民意气风发，精神大振，积极恢复生产，重建家园，出现了一片兴旺的景象。
    今年三月，当邢台地区发生严重地震灾害时，这支部队便和兄弟部队一起，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，立即奔赴救灾第一线。他们在奋力抢救人民群众生命财产中，一直用毛泽东思想提高人民群众的无产阶级觉悟，帮助群众树立战胜灾害的信心和决心。四月初，周恩来总理指示他们要大力宣传毛泽东思想，当好毛泽东思想的宣传队、播种机，用毛泽东思想武装人民群众的头脑，扎下毛泽东思想的根子。
    周总理的指示传到部队，群情振奋，一片欢腾，指战员们纷纷写决心书、保证书，要求到最艰苦的地方去，执行这个最光荣的政治任务。一支上万人的毛泽东思想宣传大军，在地方党委的统一领导下，分成千百支分队，像当年老八路一样，打起背包，背上干粮，带上毛主席著作，扛着语录牌，顶风冒雨，爬山越野，奔向邢台地区每个村庄城镇。
    怀着深厚的无产阶级感情向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想的指战员们，在宣传毛泽东思想的时候，手不离毛主席的书，嘴不离毛主席的话，心不离毛主席的思想，行动不离毛主席的教导，一举一动都按毛主席的指示办事。他们每到一处，就访贫问苦，给广大群众读毛主席的书，讲解毛主席的教导，启发大家怀着深厚的无产阶级感情读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。在宣传中，指战员们还按毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导做好样子，劳动中打先锋，当闯将，危急时刻挺身而出，抢救人民生命财产。这种“无声的宣传”使广大社员学到了活的毛泽东思想。他们说：“按毛主席的指示办事，照解放军的样子，没有错！”
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想一旦被群众所掌握，立即产生了无穷无尽的力量，人们的精神面貌为之一新。许多社员学了《为人民服务》，立刻破私立公，一心为集体；学了《纪念白求恩》，立刻舍己救人，大做好事；学了《愚公移山》，立刻大长战天斗地的英雄气概。有些社员，一时在严重灾害面前抬不起头来，当讲到毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”就忽地站起来说：“对！房倒志不倒，地动心不摇！”“听毛主席的话，刀山火海咱敢上，天塌地陷也不怕！”立即精神抖擞地和严重自然灾害展开搏斗。有些有畏难情绪的干部，一学毛主席“永远不忘阶级斗争”的教导，立即醒悟过来，“下决心为贫下中农掌握印把子，革命到底！”妇女听了毛主席的话，积极下地搞生产，青年听了毛主席的话，革命劲头更是大。人们说：“毛泽东思想是把万能的金钥匙，没有打不开的锁。”“毛主席的书是为俺穷人写的，毛主席的话，俺一百个听，一百个信，一百个照办！”
    邢台地区在伟大的毛泽东思想武装下，发生了翻天覆地的变化。广大群众说：“人换精神地换貌”，“人变、地变、村庄变，人新、地新、村庄新”，普遍反映农村出现了“八大变化”：一是活学活用毛主席著作成风，村村谈，处处学；二是热爱集体，走社会主义道路的阶级觉悟大提高，人人都要为革命种田，当革命的庄稼人；三是自力更生精神大发扬，村村队队都表示不靠地，不靠天，全靠毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄汉；四是破除封建迷信，思想大解放，千年的陈规陋俗一扫光；五是妇女积极下地劳动，学政治，闹生产，顶了半边天；六是农村干部政治思想工作水平大提高，懂得“千条万条，学习毛主席著作第一条，千件万件，突出政治第一件！”七是农村文化活动更活跃了，读革命书、唱革命歌、演革命戏，横扫旧思想、旧文化；八是毫不利己专门利人精神遍地开花，好人好事越来越多。
    思想战线的胜利，接着带来了生产战线的胜利。一个社会主义生产高潮在这里形成了。短短的半年，他们不仅基本上医治好了地震灾害带来的创伤，而且战胜了干旱，夺得了一个好夏收，又迎来了一个更为丰硕的秋收。许多地处地震中心的公社，还进行了许多农田基本建设，兴修水利，改造盐碱地，开垦河滩荒坡，粮食产量普遍增加，余粮队更富足了，缺粮队也一跃而成为余粮队。人民豪迈地说：“我们心里有了毛泽东思想，眼里有了敌人，手里有了武器，仓里有了粮食，什么天灾、地灾、妖魔鬼怪，统统不在话下！”
    宣传群众，教育自己。这支部队在向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想的同时，也使自己受到了深刻的教育。广大贫下中农热爱毛主席的深厚感情，促使指战员更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作；农村的阶级斗争，使广大指战员受到一次最深刻最实际的阶级教育；人民热爱子弟兵的生动事实，进一步坚定了指战员们全心全意为人民服务的思想；广大社员艰苦朴素的作风，也促使广大指战员决心发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。他们说：农村是一个广阔的天地，处处是课堂，事事受教育，贫下中农是好的教员，阶级斗争是活的教材，上了终生难忘的一课。他们纷纷表示，要更加自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，到群众中去，到实践中去，永远当好毛泽东思想宣传队。（附图片）
    解放军某部干部战士决心当好毛泽东思想的红色宣传员，做全心全意为人民服务的勤务员。这是战士们在地头说快板，宣扬活学活用毛主席著作中涌现的好人好事。                  新华社稿
