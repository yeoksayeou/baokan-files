More than 260 Japanese youth preparing to go to Beijing to participate in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Festival held a rally in Tokyo on the 20th, strongly protesting the Sato government's disregard for the legitimate rights of the Japanese people, its hostility towards China, and its reactionary act of refusing to issue passports to Japanese youth visiting China, thereby sabotaging Sino-Japanese youth exchanges.

Members of the Diet from the Socialist Party, including Kuroda Juman, Okada Haruo, and Hozumi Shichiro, attended the rally.

Kuroda Juman said in his speech, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is flourishing, has opened up a brilliant path that no one in the world has ever walked before. It is very meaningful for Japanese youth to go to China to celebrate at this time." Kuroda pointed out, "Those who fear Sino-Japanese friendship are the U.S. imperialism, which is expanding its aggression in Vietnam, and the reactionary forces of Japanese monopoly capital." He said, "The Chinese people have become the backbone of the fighting Vietnamese people. The Japanese government has become an accomplice of U.S. imperialism. Therefore, strengthening the fighting friendship between the peoples and youth of the two countries, Japan and China, is of great significance."

Kuroda emphasized, "If the Japanese government obstructs Sino-Japanese youth exchanges, should we stop? No, absolutely not. The fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China in the anti-American struggle cannot be stopped. Although there is a countercurrent in the Sino-Japanese friendship movement that does not advocate and obstructs Sino-Japanese friendship, all new and old countercurrents cannot stop the historical tide of Sino-Japanese friendship." He called on Japanese youth, saying, "Our struggle is not just about obtaining a passport. We must unite as one, break through the sabotage and obstruction of internal and external enemies and various countercurrents, mobilize the masses, strengthen the struggle, and make the Sino-Japanese friendship movement advance victoriously in the correct direction."

The rally also reported on the process of various delegations preparing to participate in the festival and their struggles against various countercurrents and reactionary forces. The youth representatives present were all full of fighting spirit, expressing their determination to resolutely fight against the enemies and various reactionary forces that obstruct Sino-Japanese friendship until the Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Festival is realized.

The rally, amid enthusiastic applause, passed a letter of protest to the Sato government and a declaration.

The letter of protest said: "The Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Festival is very meaningful for deepening mutual understanding between the peoples of the two countries, Japan and China, and for safeguarding peace in Asia. From this standpoint, we swear to strive for the success of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Festival." The Sato government's unreasonable refusal to issue passports for visiting China "not only violates the Passport Law but is also a clear violation of the Constitution."

The letter of protest pointed out that the Sato government's participation in the U.S. Far Eastern strategy and its hostile attitude towards China have been exposed nakedly. The letter of protest demands that the Sato government immediately cancel the decision to refuse to issue passports and promptly issue passports.

The declaration of the rally said that Japanese youth standing on the position of promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and safeguarding world peace swear to break through the unreasonable obstruction of the Sato government, struggle for the issuance of passports, and fight to the end for the success of the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Festival.

Newswire Tokyo, September 21: Japanese Socialist Party Secretary-General Nariaki Noda, on the 20th, on behalf of the entire party, strongly protested the Sato government's refusal to issue passports to approximately 700 Japanese youth participating in the Second Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Festival. Nariaki Noda pointed out in the protest: The Sato government had previously refused the visit of the delegation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs invited by the Socialist Party and the visit of the Chinese delegation led by Liu Ningyi to attend the 12th World Conference Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. Today, it ruthlessly refused to issue passports to Japanese youth visiting China, which is a blatant manifestation of the Sato government's policy of hostility towards China.

The protest said: "The Socialist Party, in order to promote friendship between the two countries, Japan and China, and to realize the restoration of diplomatic relations, firmly supports the youth movement that is widely developing in Japan to strive for the successful victory of the Sino-Japanese Youth Grand Festival, and strongly protests against the government's unreasonable decision. At the same time, to force the government to cancel this unreasonable decision and recognize the legitimate right of every citizen to obtain a passport, we will spare no effort to fight until we achieve victory."

    日本青年集会强烈抗议佐藤政府破坏中日青年大联欢
    中日人民友好是任何力量都阻挠不了的
    社会党书记长成田谴责日本政府敌视中国，支持日本青年的斗争
    新华社东京二十一日电　准备前往北京参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢的二百六十多名日本青年二十日在东京举行大会，强烈抗议佐藤政府无视日本人民正当权利，敌视中国，悍然拒绝发给日本青年访华护照，破坏日中青年友好往来的反动行为。
    社会党国会议员黑田寿男、冈田春夫和穗积七郎等出席了大会。
    黑田寿男在讲话中说，“中国正在蓬勃发展的无产阶级文化大革命，开创了世界上前人所没有走过的光辉道路，日本青年在这个时候到中国去联欢是非常有意义的”。黑田指出，“害怕日中青年友好的是正在扩大侵略越南战争的美帝国主义和日本垄断资本反动势力”。他说，“中国人民已经成为战斗的越南人民的后盾。日本政府已经成了美帝国主义的帮凶。因此，加强日中两国人民、两国青年的战斗友谊是有重要意义的”。
    黑田强调说，“日本政府阻挠日中青年联欢，是不是我们就停止不前呢？不能，绝对不能。日中两国人民在反美斗争中的战斗友谊是不能停下来的。尽管日中友好运动中，有一股逆流，不主张和阻挠日中友好，但是所有的新的旧的逆流都无法阻挡日中友好的历史潮流”。他对日本青年发出号召说，“我们的斗争，不仅是要取得一张护照的斗争问题。我们一定要团结一致，冲破内外敌人和各种逆流的破坏和阻挠，发动群众，加强斗争，使日中友好运动朝着一个正确的方向胜利前进”。
    大会还报告了准备参加大联欢的各代表团在组成过程中同各种逆流和反动势力进行斗争的经过，与会青年代表个个斗志昂扬，他们表示要坚决同阻挠日中友好的敌人和各种反动势力斗争到底，直到实现日中青年友好大联欢。
    大会在热烈的掌声中通过了给佐藤政府的抗议书和大会宣言。
    抗议书说：“日中两国青年友好大联欢对加深日中两国人民的相互了解和对保卫亚洲的和平，是非常有意义的，从这一立场出发，我们誓为第二届日中青年友好大联欢的成功而努力”。佐藤政府无理拒发访华护照，“不仅是违反护照法，并且是明显的违背宪法的行为”。
    抗议书指出，佐藤政府参与美国的远东战略和敌视中国的态度，已经赤裸裸地暴露出来。抗议书要求佐藤政府立即取消拒发护照的决定，迅速发给护照。
    大会宣言说，站在增进日中友好、保卫世界和平立场上的日本青年，誓为冲破佐藤政府的无理阻挠、争取获得护照、为第二届日中青年友好大联欢的成功而斗争到底。
    新华社东京二十一日电　日本社会党书记长成田知巳二十日代表全党就佐藤政府拒绝发给参加第二届日中青年友好大联欢的约七百名日本青年访华护照，提出了强烈的抗议。成田在抗议中指出：佐藤政府曾经拒绝了社会党邀请的中国人民外交学会代表团访日，和以刘宁一为团长的出席第十二届禁止原子弹氢弹世界大会的中国代表团访日，今天又粗暴地拒绝发给日本青年的访华护照，这是佐藤政府敌视中国政策的露骨的表现。
    抗议说：“社会党为了促进日中两国的友好、为了实现恢复日中邦交而坚决支持正在日本广泛开展的为日中青年友好大联欢的胜利成功而努力的青年运动，并对政府的无理决定表示强烈抗议。同时，为了迫使政府取消这种无理决定和承认每个国民有获得护照的正当权利，将全力以赴地进行斗争，直到取得胜利。”
