For the Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong

	Who are the revolutionaries?
	Who are the counter-revolutionaries?
	Who are the verbal revolutionaries?

	The revolutionaries are those who
	Follow Chairman Mao's teachings,
	Firmly support the Party Central Committee,
	And resolutely carry out the Cultural Revolution.

	The counter-revolutionaries are those who
	Oppose Chairman Mao's teachings,
	Resist the Party Central Committee,
	And sabotage the Cultural Revolution.

	The verbal revolutionaries are those who
	Talk big about revolution,
	But in reality, do not support the Party Central Committee,
	And do not carry out the Cultural Revolution.

	Who are the revolutionaries?
	Who are the counter-revolutionaries?
	Who are the verbal revolutionaries?

	The revolutionaries are those who
	Follow Chairman Mao's teachings,
	Firmly support the Party Central Committee,
	And resolutely carry out the Cultural Revolution.

	The counter-revolutionaries are those who
	Oppose Chairman Mao's teachings,
	Resist the Party Central Committee,
	And sabotage the Cultural Revolution.

	The verbal revolutionaries are those who
	Talk big about revolution,
	But in reality, do not support the Party Central Committee,
	And do not carry out the Cultural Revolution.
