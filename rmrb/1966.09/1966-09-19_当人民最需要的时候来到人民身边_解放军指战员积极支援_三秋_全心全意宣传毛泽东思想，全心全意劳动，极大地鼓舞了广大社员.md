The People's Liberation Army soldiers actively support the "three autumns"
Wholeheartedly propagating Mao Zedong Thought, wholeheartedly working, greatly inspiring the masses of community members

Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army of China have recently taken Mao Zedong's works and production tools to the forefront of agricultural production with the revolutionary enthusiasm that has emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are enthusiastically helping the community members study Mao Zedong's works and actively supporting the autumn harvest, autumn sowing, and autumn plowing in rural people's communes. The actions of the soldiers have greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the people in various places to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

The leadership organs of the Beijing and Jinan military regions recently issued notices, respectively, requiring subordinate units to actively support the local "three autumns" and achieve a bumper harvest this year. After receiving the notices, the various units organized the soldiers to study Chairman Mao's instructions on "The People's Liberation Army should be a great school" and related editorials in the People's Daily. They fully understood the great significance of fighting the "three autumns" production battle. Many units immediately took action. After the soldiers arrived at the production front line, they took the initiative to take on heavy tasks and rush to do hard work, fully demonstrating the spirit of enduring hardships and hard work, and the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people.

In the Wuhan region, many soldiers took Mao Zedong's works and carried Mao Zedong's quotations to the nearby people's communes of their garrisons. They worked with the community members to harvest sorghum, pick corn, pick cotton, and transport fertilizer to the autumn fields, adding a strong force to the busy season of the "three autumns." The soldiers of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region, near the Iron City People's Commune, had more than 1,200 mu of potatoes soaked in the ground due to continuous rain, and they were about to be damaged. After hearing the news, the officers and soldiers of this unit, with the revolutionary spirit of Liu Yingjun, braved the rain and joined the battle to rescue the potatoes. After two days of hard work, they successfully completed the task. The soldiers of many units of the Inner Mongolia Military Region also put forward the slogan of precise harvesting and threshing, ensuring quality and quantity, striving for every grain to return to the granary. The soldiers' spirit and actions of wholeheartedly supporting the "three autumns" were highly praised by the community members. The community members said, "The PLA is truly the good soldiers of Chairman Mao, the children of the people. When we need them the most, they come to our side, just like a timely rain."

The soldiers of various units supporting the "three autumns" on the agricultural front line, while working hard, used various forms to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers of many units in the Nanjing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Kunming, Chengdu, and Lanzhou regions took Mao Zedong's quotation boards to the fields. During rest times, they studied Mao Zedong's works with the community members in the fields, turning the fields into a large classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong's works. Many soldiers in the units also put up Mao Zedong's quotation boards and large character slogans at the field edges, road junctions, courtyards, and courtyards, allowing the community members to read Mao Zedong's quotations at any time and in any place, drawing strength from Mao Zedong's teachings. The soldiers of a certain reconnaissance company of the Shenyang Military Region, during five consecutive days of labor, studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with the community members every day and held lectures and experience-sharing meetings. Many soldiers also sent Mao Zedong's portraits to the community members' homes. Poor peasant Liu Grandma excitedly said, "Mao Zedong's portrait is hung in my home, Mao Zedong Thought is rooted in my home, Chairman Mao's soldiers live in my home, and no matter how big the difficulty, we are not afraid." The soldiers of a certain motorized transport regiment supporting the harvest of green barley in the Ge'ermu Farm under the Kunlun Mountains also sang revolutionary songs with the community members, enthusiastically praising the Party and Chairman Mao. The soldiers' active and enthusiastic propagation of Mao Zedong Thought greatly inspired the revolutionary spirit of the community members. They all expressed their determination to firmly read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be good community members according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and to seize the double victories of revolution and production according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

In the joint labor, the broad masses of community members showed their boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao, their profound class feelings for Mao Zedong's works, and their excellent qualities of diligence, bravery, and hard work. This gave the broad soldiers a great education. Through participating in rural labor, they saw with their own eyes the great material force that the broad masses of community members released after mastering Mao Zedong Thought, and they deeply felt the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers expressed their determination to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to achieve ideological revolutionization, to do a good job in all work, and to defend the ironclad mountains and rivers of the socialist motherland.
