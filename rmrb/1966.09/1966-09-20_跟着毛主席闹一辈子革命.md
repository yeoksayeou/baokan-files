More than 100,000 revolutionary workers in Jinan recently received copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" distributed by the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Jinan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. All revolutionary workers were overjoyed upon receiving the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

After obtaining a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," old sailor Yang Guofeng from the Xiaoqing River Navigation Bureau was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes, and he raised his arm to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Revolutionary workers at the Jinan Knitting Factory said that Chairman Mao's book is a spiritual atomic bomb with the greatest power. With Chairman Mao's book and the mastery of Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven nor earth, dare to climb mountains of knives, and dare to rush into seas of fire. We workers will follow Chairman Mao to make revolution for life.

After receiving the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," revolutionary workers eagerly studied them with deep class sentiments. They studied before and after work, got up early and went to bed late, seizing every opportunity to study. Many people, after studying Chairman Mao's quotations on class and class struggle, became even more clear-sighted and continuously achieved new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命
    据新华社济南电  济南十万多革命职工，最近领到了山东省总工会和济南市总工会发给的《毛主席语录》。广大革命职工领到《毛主席语录》后，个个欣喜若狂。
    小清河航运局的老船工杨国丰得到一本《毛主席语录》以后，激动得热泪盈眶，振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”济南针织厂的革命职工说，毛主席的书是精神原子弹，威力最大。有了毛主席的书，掌握了毛泽东思想，就天不怕，地不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。我们工人要跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命。
    广大革命职工领到《毛主席语录》后，如饥似渴地怀着深厚的阶级感情进行学习。他们班前学，班后学，早起晚睡，抓紧一切时间进行学习。许多人学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的语录，更加心明眼亮，不断地夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的胜利。
