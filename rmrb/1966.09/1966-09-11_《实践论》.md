	Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism has two most prominent characteristics: one is its class nature, openly declaring that dialectical materialism serves the proletariat; the other is its practicality, emphasizing the dependence of theory on practice, with practice as the foundation of theory, which in turn serves practice.

    马克思主义的哲学辩证唯物论有两个最显著的特点：一个是它的阶级性，公然申明辩证唯物论是为无产阶级服务的；再一个是它的实践性，强调理论对于实践的依赖关系，理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务。
    毛泽东《实践论》
