The British government on August 22 illegally released a so-called "report" by the Indian and Canadian representatives on the International Control Commission in Laos, claiming that there are North Vietnamese troops in Laos. This is a vile political conspiracy.

The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have both issued statements exposing the fabrication of the false report by Britain, India, and Canada, which serves the ugly schemes of the United States to expand its aggression in Laos. The Chinese people firmly support the just stance of the Lao and Vietnamese peoples.

Currently, the U.S. imperialism, which is in a desperate situation in Vietnam, is trying to expand the Vietnam War into Laos, especially the central and southern regions, thereby linking Thailand, Laos, and South Vietnam into a single battlefield. The British government and the Indian and Canadian representatives, following the instructions of the United States, suddenly spread these rumors at this critical moment to provide a pretext for the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys to launch a large-scale invasion of Laos and expand the war in Indochina. The intentions of the U.S. accomplices are indeed malicious!

The Indian and Canadian representatives fabricated the false report, and the British government released it. The U.S. imperialism is the mastermind behind this political conspiracy. As soon as the U.S. State Department heard that the false report had been released, it immediately expressed "special interest." This is a case of self-incrimination.

The International Control Commission in Laos has long since degenerated into a tool for shielding and aiding U.S. aggression in Laos. This organization has lost all legitimacy to conduct legal activities. The activities and statements made by the Indian and Canadian representatives under the name of the International Control Commission are completely illegal. The British government is a notorious accomplice of U.S. aggression in Vietnam, Laos, and the entire Indochina region. The new crimes committed by Wilson and his ilk in serving U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and Laos are already on record. Debts must be repaid. The chief culprit, U.S. imperialism, cannot escape. The accomplice, Britain, cannot escape. The Indian and Canadian representatives, who act as lackeys, also cannot escape.

    卑鄙的政治阴谋
    本报评论员
    英国政府于八月二十二日，非法公布了老挝国际委员会中的印度和加拿大代表的一份所谓“在老挝有北越军队”的造谣“报告”。这是一个卑鄙的政治阴谋。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会和越南民主共和国外交部发言人已经分别发表声明，揭穿英、印、加制造假报告，为美国扩大侵略老挝效劳的丑恶勾当。中国人民坚决支持老挝人民和越南人民的严正立场。
    目前，在越南被打得走投无路的美帝国主义，力图把侵越战争扩大到老挝，特别是中、下寮，从而使泰国、老挝和越南南方连成一个战场。英国政府和印、加代表按照美国的指使，突然在这个时候大造其谣，就是为了要给美帝国主义及其仆从的军队大举入侵老挝、扩大印度支那战争制造根据。美国帮凶走卒们的用心，可谓毒矣！
    印、加代表制造假报告，英国政府出面发表，美帝国主义则是策划这一政治阴谋的总头子。美国国务院一听到假报告已经抛出来，马上表示美国“特别感兴趣”。这叫做不打自招。
    老挝国际委员会早已堕落成为包庇和帮助美国侵略老挝的工具，这个机构已经失去了进行合法活动的一切权利。印、加代表利用国际委员会名义进行的活动，发表的言论，完全是非法的。英国政府是美国侵略越南、老挝和整个印度支那的臭名远扬的帮凶。对于威尔逊之流为美帝国主义侵略越南、老挝效劳的新罪行，已经记录在案。欠债是要还的。罪魁美帝国主义逃不了。帮凶英国逃不了。印、加代表甘当走卒，也逃不了。
