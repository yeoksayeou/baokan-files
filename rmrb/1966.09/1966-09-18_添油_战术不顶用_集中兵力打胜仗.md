Mao Zedong's brilliant work "Concentrate Superior Forces, Annihilate the Enemy One by One" was published twenty years ago. Today, as I revisit this great work of Marxism-Leninism on military strategy with profound respect, I feel especially close to it.

In 1946, I served as the political instructor of a platoon in a certain regiment. At that time, we did not fully understand Chairman Mao's directive, and thus in the Battle of Sanjiazicheng, we adopted a tactic similar to "adding oil" rather than concentrating superior forces to strike at a single point. As a result, we achieved a small victory at the cost of great sacrifices. Shortly after, we engaged in another counterattack. Having learned from our mistakes, we fought this battle more clearly. During the battle, we resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, concentrating the main forces of the entire platoon like a sharp knife, piercing the enemy's weakest point, and quickly ending the battle, annihilating the enemy completely.

In September 1947, on the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's great directive, our platoon was tasked with attacking the enemy garrison on Yangzhangzi Mountain in western Liaoning. At that time, there was an enemy reinforced platoon on Yangzhangzi Mountain. Behind this platoon was the enemy's guard battalion, and behind the guard battalion was the headquarters of the enemy's 105th Division. If the enemy lost Yangzhangzi Mountain, their division headquarters would be seriously threatened. Therefore, this mountain became a strategic point for both sides. The higher command entrusted our platoon with the honorable task of capturing the mountain. After accepting the mission, we first, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, carefully observed the terrain, studied the enemy situation, and convened a party committee meeting to discuss how to annihilate the enemy in one decisive battle. We organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's directive on "concentrating superior forces, annihilating the enemy one by one." First, we criticized the complacent and arrogant idea that "the enemy only has one platoon, it's not difficult to defeat." On this basis, everyone eagerly offered suggestions and proposed various battle plans. Once the truth is grasped by the masses, it becomes a tremendous material force. Based on the opinions of the masses, we decided to place the main force of the entire platoon in the frontal attack. To disperse the enemy's firepower and turn their advantage into a disadvantage, we also sent out two small forces to launch feints on the enemy's flanks. The enemy thought we would not dare to attack their front, so they dispersed their main firepower to the flanks. Unexpectedly, our main force launched a sudden attack from the front, catching the enemy off guard. In less than five minutes, the enemy was completely annihilated. Subsequently, the enemy's 105th Division was also completely wiped out by our army. In this battle, our platoon was awarded the banner for "fighting bravely and tenaciously."

Over the past twenty years, through numerous battles and countless tasks, I have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's principle of "concentrating superior forces, annihilating the enemy one by one" is the highest summary of the people's war and our army's combat experience, and the latest development of Marxism-Leninism military science. It is a master key. Whether in battle or in work, as long as this principle is correctly applied, victory can be achieved.

### “添油”战术不顶用  集中兵力打胜仗

    “添油”战术不顶用  集中兵力打胜仗
    武汉部队某师政治部主任　耿万恒
    毛主席的《集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人》这篇光辉著作，发表已经二十年了。在二十年后的今天，我怀着万分崇敬的心情，重温这一伟大的马克思列宁主义的军事著作，感到格外亲切。
    一九四六年，我在某团一连当指导员。当时，我们对毛主席这个指示体会得不深，因而在三十家子战斗中，采取了“添灯油”式的打法，而不是集中优势兵力，攻其一点。结果以大的牺牲换取了小的胜利。紧接着又进行了一场反击战。吃一堑就长一智，这次战斗我们就比较清醒了。在战斗中，我们坚决按照毛主席的教导去打，集中了全连的主要兵力，像一把尖刀一样，插进敌人最弱的一点上，很快地结束了战斗，全歼了敌人。
    一九四七年九月，也就是毛主席这一伟大指示发表一周年的时候，我们连接受了攻打辽宁西部杨仗子山守敌的任务。当时，杨仗子山头有敌人一个加强排的兵力，这个排的后面是敌人的警卫营，警卫营的后面便是敌人一○五师的师部。敌人如果丢了杨仗子山头，他们的师部就受到了严重的威胁。因此，这个山头成为敌我双方必争之地。上级把攻占山头的光荣任务交给了我们连。我们接受任务后，首先按照毛主席的教导，仔细地观察了地形，研究了敌情，并召开了支部委员会，研究怎么打，才能一举全歼敌人？我们组织大家学习了毛主席关于“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的指示。首先对“敌人只有一个排，没有什么难打的”的麻痹轻敌思想，进行了批判。在这个基础上，大家纷纷出谋献策，提出各种战斗方案。真理一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。根据群众的意见，我们决定把全连的主力放在正面攻击。为了分散敌人的火力，使敌人由有利变不利，我们还派出了两股少数兵力，对敌两侧先发起佯攻，敌人以为我们不敢攻击他们正面，就把主要火力分散两侧。没想到我们连的主力从正面突然发起攻击，使敌人措手不及，不到五分钟，敌人就全部被歼。随后，敌一○五师也被我军全部消灭。在这个战斗中，我们连荣获了“打得英勇顽强”的奖旗。
    二十年来，我从许多次战斗和无数件工作中，深深体会到：毛主席提出的关于“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”的原则，是对人民战争和我军作战经验的最高总结，是对马克思列宁主义军事科学的最新发展。它是一把万能的金钥匙。无论是打仗还是做工作，只要正确运用这一原则，都能取得胜利。
