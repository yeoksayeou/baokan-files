On the eve of National Day, I am filled with immense excitement as I celebrate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! I celebrate our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

I am a pilot who grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. On my first mission, I was ordered to take off and engage in combat, where I shot down an American imperialist unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that had invaded our airspace. This combat experience made me realize even more deeply: the best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought, and the greatest combat power is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless. Pilots must truly prioritize politics, dare to fight and sacrifice in battle, and be invincible and unstoppable. To achieve this, we must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

The Most Important Thing Is to Sharpen the Sword in Our Minds

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy is sharpening their swords, so we must sharpen ours as well." For us proletarian pilots, the most important thing is to sharpen our mental swords, to see through the nature of American imperialism's aggression and war, and to elevate our war consciousness.

Chairman Mao says: "Create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." In our struggle against the enemy, we have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's profound judgment. The enemy's repeated attempts to create chaos have all failed, and they will not give up. We cannot predict when the enemy will come, but we must be prepared for battle at all times. Only by maintaining a high state of combat readiness can we ensure constant vigilance and be prepared for any eventuality.

When I first joined the combat squad, the higher-ups designated me and my aircraft as a reserve unit. Usually, when the reserves are called into action, it is at the most critical moment of the battle. Therefore, I warned myself: even as a reserve, I must firmly establish the mindset of a combat unit. American imperialism never gives us a "standby" signal; they always launch surprise attacks. Only by maintaining the mindset of a combat unit can we truly fulfill our mission to counter enemy surprise attacks. I insisted on being ready at all times, whether on standby or not, whether there is a warning or not, whether the weather is good or bad. It was because I armed myself with Mao Zedong Thought that I was able to achieve victory in the battle to shoot down the enemy aircraft.

Breaking Free from "Foreign Frameworks" to Forge Our Own Path

During my combat missions, I was supposed to use a certain type of weapon according to regulations. However, my aircraft was not suitable for this weapon, and I was also constrained by some "foreign frameworks" that restricted my actions. If I followed these "frameworks," I would not be able to destroy the enemy aircraft. What should I do? We brought this question to our study of Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." Chairman Mao's words illuminated our minds and resolved our doubts. We are proletarian air force soldiers; we must be the masters of our weapons and never their slaves.

Next, we further analyzed the "foreign frameworks" using Chairman Mao's teachings. We realized that the existing "frameworks" were derived from limited practical experiences and had both limitations and one-sidedness. Moreover, the exploration, research, and conclusions of various theories and data should all include the human spirit. People's worldviews differ, and the same practices can lead to different conclusions. Therefore, regardless of the weapons we use, the most important thing is to unleash the power of the people. Only by combining revolution with modernization can we achieve limitless power.

With the collective wisdom of everyone, we summarized the experiences and lessons from previous battles, formulated various experimental plans, and through repeated practice, finally developed our own theories. This created favorable conditions for using certain weapons to destroy enemy aircraft.

Only Through Ideological Revolution Can We Be the Bravest

I often think: we are the successors of the revolutionary cause who carry guns. Only by embodying bravery and daring to "fight to the death" in our struggle against American imperialism can we be reliable successors. Bravery leads to greater composure, composure leads to greater wisdom, and we can hit the target every time, effectively and cleanly eliminating the enemy. Once, during a flight, my aircraft malfunctioned, causing it to enter a steep dive from high altitude. I struggled to control the aircraft, which was very unresponsive. At that moment, I glanced at the ejection handle and then at the instruments, recalling Chairman Mao's words: "Favorable conditions and the restoration of the initiative come from the effort to 'hold on a little longer.'" My thought of ejecting quickly disappeared, and I decided to hold on a little longer and seize the last hope. Through calm efforts, I finally managed to fly the aircraft back to the base safely.

Later, comrades asked me what had supported me in bringing the aircraft back. I said it was Mao Zedong Thought, it was Chairman Mao teaching us to "preserve ourselves and eliminate the enemy." I believe that this "ourselves" includes the people, the country, as well as the pilot and the aircraft. When the aircraft is difficult to control, one must think of the whole, not of the individual. If one thinks too much about personal safety, the person may be safe, but the aircraft will be destroyed, causing loss to the country and the people; if one thinks of the whole and strives to preserve the aircraft, personal safety will naturally be ensured. Of course, if there is no way to preserve the aircraft, the pilot insisting on doing so is wrong; conversely, if there is even a slight chance to preserve the aircraft, and the pilot does not do so, that is also extremely wrong.

The victory of shooting down the enemy aircraft is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Without Chairman Mao's teachings, I, a farmer's son, would never have become a proletarian pilot. In the future, I will definitely regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest guiding principle, accelerate ideological revolution, further prioritize politics, and always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Humility leads to progress, arrogance leads to decline." I will remain humble and diligent, carefully summarize experiences, continuously overcome shortcomings, maintain high vigilance, and be ready at any time to decisively eliminate all enemy aircraft that dare to invade, striving for greater victories.

Editor's Note: The People's Liberation Army is a great army created by our great leader Chairman Mao. All officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, under the call of Comrade Lin Biao, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and achieved great successes in the construction of revolutionization and modernization; in the struggle to defend and build socialist China and resist imperialist aggression, they have made brilliant contributions. Now, studying Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and being good soldiers of Chairman Mao has become the unanimous action guideline of the entire army. The communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee points out: "Comrade Lin Biao calls on the People's Liberation Army to launch a mass movement of studying Mao Zedong's works throughout the army, setting a brilliant example for the entire Party and the nation." The People's Liberation Army is the best school for studying Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call for the entire nation to learn from the People's Liberation Army. We must, like the People's Liberation Army, always prioritize politics and raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher. We must, like the People's Liberation Army, have boundless love, faith, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. We must, like the People's Liberation Army, always be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, and loyal to the people. We must, like the People's Liberation Army, turn every industry and sector into a school for Mao Zedong Thought, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever!

### 最好的武器是毛泽东思想

    最好的武器是毛泽东思想
    空军某部大队长　冯全民
    在国庆节前夕，我怀着万分激动的心情，欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！欢呼我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！！
    我是一个在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的飞行战士。我第一次奉命起飞作战，就击落了一架入侵我国领空的美帝国主义军用无人驾驶高空侦察机。这次空战实践，使我进一步认识到：最好的武器是毛泽东思想，最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。飞行员要真正突出政治，在战斗中敢打敢拚，有我无敌，锐不可当，就必须读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    最要紧的是磨快思想上的刀
    毛主席教导我们：敌人“已经在磨刀了，因此，我们也要磨刀。”对我们无产阶级的飞行战士来说，最重要的就是要把思想上的刀磨得快快的，对美帝国主义侵略和战争的本性看得透透的，把自己的战争观念提得高高的。
    毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”在对敌斗争中，我们对毛主席的这个英明论断，领会得更加深刻。敌人连续几次的捣乱都失败了，他们是不会罢休的。敌人什么时候来，我们不好预料，但是我们着眼于敌人来，每时每刻都准备打仗。只有用高度的战备观念来管具体的战备工作，才能做到常备不懈，有备无患。
    我刚到作战小分队时，上级把我和我驾驶的飞机列为预备队。等到用上预备队，通常也正是仗打得最要劲的时候。于是，我就警告自己：预备队也要牢固地树立战斗队的思想，美帝国主义从来对我们不发“预备”信号，一贯是搞突然袭击的，只有我们树立战斗队的思想，才能真正担当起反击敌人突然袭击的光荣任务。我坚持做到了“三个一样”，就是：不担任战斗值班和担任战斗值班一样，无敌情预报和有敌情预报一样，好天与坏天一样，随时都做好战斗准备。由于用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，才使我在击落敌机的战斗中取得了胜利。
    打破“洋框框”走自己的路
    我在执行作战任务时，按照规定应该使用某种武器攻击敌机。本来我驾驶的飞机是不适用这种武器的，加上又受到了一些“洋框框”的束缚，把人给框住了。如果照那些“框框”去做，根本就消灭不了敌机。怎么办呢？我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”毛主席的话照亮了我们的心，解开了我们的疑团。我们是无产阶级的空军战士，要作兵器的主人，决不当兵器的奴隶。
    接着，我们又进一步用毛主席的教导，具体分析了“洋框框”。认识到，现有的“框框”，有的是别人在有限的实践中得出来的东西，不仅有局限性，也有片面性。再说，各种理论和数据的探索、研究、结论，也都应当包含人的精神因素在内。人们的世界观不同，同样的实践，也会作出不同的结论。因此，我们不论使用什么武器，最重要的是必须发挥人的因素，只有用革命化统帅现代化，才会如虎添翼，威力无穷。
    大家有了为革命而飞行的思想，有了批判“洋框框”的认识，就决心群策群力，勇于实践，用集体的智慧，总结历次作战的经验教训，订出各种试验方案，经过反复实践，终于摸出了自己的理论，这就为使用某种武器消灭敌机创造了有利条件。
    思想革命化才能最勇敢
    我常想：我们是扛着枪杆子的革命事业的接班人，只有发扬勇敢精神，在与美帝国主义的搏斗中敢于“刺刀见红”，才是过得硬的可靠的接班人。勇敢就会更加镇定，镇定就会更加聪明，就会百发百中，最有效地干净利落地把敌人消灭掉。一次飞行中，我的飞机发生了故障，飞机马上自然转成侧滑状态，从高空骤急下降。我摆动摆动驾驶杆，操纵特别费劲，飞机很不听使唤。这时，我看了一下跳伞把手，又看了一下仪表，想起了毛主席的话：“有利的情况和主动的恢复，产生于‘再坚持一下’的努力之中”。我要跳伞的念头很快就打消了，决心再坚持一下，争取一线希望。经过一番镇定的努力，终于使飞机安全飞回了基地。
    事后，同志们问我是什么东西支持着我把飞机驾回来的。我说，是毛泽东思想，是毛主席教导我们要“保存自己，消灭敌人”。我认为这“自己”，首先是人民，是国家，也包括飞行员和飞机。在飞机难以操纵时，只能想整体，不能想个人。个人的安危想得多了，人虽然可以安全下来，飞机可就砸了，国家和人民就会遭到损失；为整体着想，千方百计保全了飞机，个人自然也会安全。当然，已经没有条件保全飞机，飞行员硬要保全，是不对的；相反，那怕只有一线希望可以保全飞机，而飞行员不加以保全，那也是极端错误的。
    击落敌机的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利，没有毛主席的教导，我这样一个农民的儿子，永远也不会成为无产阶级的飞行战士。今后，我一定要把毛主席的书当作最高指导方针，加速思想革命化，进一步突出政治，牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，戒骄戒躁，认真总结经验，不断克服缺点，始终保持高度警惕，随时准备坚决消灭一切敢于来犯的敌机，争取更大的胜利。
    编者按　中国人民解放军是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的一支人民的军队。人民解放军的全体指战员，在林彪同志号召下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，在革命化和现代化建设上，取得了伟大的成就；在保卫和建设社会主义祖国，反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中，作出了光辉的贡献。现在，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，已经成为全军上下一致的行动准则。党的八届十一中全会公报指出：“林彪同志号召人民解放军在全军展开学习毛泽东同志著作的群众运动，为全党全国树立了光辉的榜样。”人民解放军是一座最好的学习毛泽东思想的大学校。我们坚决响应毛主席关于全国学习解放军的伟大号召。要像解放军那样，永远突出政治，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗高举更高举。要像解放军那样，对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜。要像解放军那样，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民。要像解放军那样，把全国各行各业都办成毛泽东思想的大学校，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
