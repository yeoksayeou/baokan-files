Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive driving the spiritual and material fronts forward. The national industrial and agricultural production is presenting a new leap-forward situation.

Industry: In the first eight months, the production plan was over-fulfilled, product quality significantly improved, world-record-breaking new achievements emerged one after another, new products with major significance for the national economy were continuously introduced, and scientific and technological achievements with international significance were successively born.

Agriculture: Whether it is grain crops or economic crops, whether it is plains, lake areas, or mountainous and hilly areas, everywhere is a scene of bumper harvests. The increase in production in the northern provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions this year is generally quite significant, and the low-yield situation is undergoing tremendous changes.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers on the industrial front, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with fiery revolutionary enthusiasm, boundless wisdom and strength, have charged forward on the spiritual and material fronts, achieving one great victory after another. Together with the revolutionary masses across the country, they have pushed China's socialist revolution and socialist construction to new heights.

At present, the industrial front is presenting a new leap-forward situation. On the eve of the nation's joyous celebration of the 17th anniversary of the founding of New China, production bulletins are coming in frequently: production plans are over-fulfilled, product quality is significantly improved, world-record-breaking new achievements emerge one after another, new products with major significance for the national economy are continuously introduced, and scientific and technological achievements with international significance are successively born. The total industrial output value of the country, on the basis of a significant increase in the past two years, has increased by more than 20% in the first eight months of this year compared to the same period last year; the quantity, variety, and quality of products have all seen significant development and improvement. In particular, the support for agriculture in terms of fertilizers, pesticides, and walk-behind tractors has increased by 40% to more than twice compared to the same period last year. Basic industries such as steel, electricity, petroleum, coal, and machinery, as well as industries that meet people's living needs such as textiles, paper, and cigarettes, have all seen significant increases compared to the same period last year.

All of these are new victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. All of these vividly illustrate: Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive driving China's spiritual and material fronts forward. With Mao Zedong Thought in the lead and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the driving force, it can effectively promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, further unleash the boundless enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and generate tremendous material forces to promote the great development of productive forces.

Since this year, the new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the broad masses of workers is the most fundamental guarantee for the victory on the industrial front. The broad masses of workers, with the deepest class feelings and the most tenacious revolutionary will, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Especially in the recent high tide of the Cultural Revolution, they have, through their own struggles and practices, come to a deeper understanding: to shoulder the great mission bestowed by history on the Chinese working class and not to disappoint the expectations of the revolutionary people of the world, one must arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide all actions.

Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, and the masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, it turns thousands and millions of people, who were once considered the most "humble" and "ignorant" by the bourgeoisie, into the smartest, bravest, and most creative people in the world. In production struggles and scientific experiments, they dare to think and dare to venture, despise all bourgeois "authorities," and continuously break through foreign and old frameworks, climbing peaks that predecessors have not climbed. A large number of unknown ordinary workers have become pioneers in conquering scientific frontiers, and many factories with poor equipment have continuously produced products of world standards.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers study and apply Chairman Mao's theories on socialist revolution and socialist construction, resolutely fight against a handful of capitalists in power, resolutely fight against bourgeois reactionary academic authorities, criticize various capitalist and revisionist management ideas in enterprises, further clarify the path to running socialist enterprises well, and establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly. The idea of "being in the workshop, thinking of the country, and looking at the world" has become more deeply rooted in people's minds, and the spirit of communism has been greatly promoted.

At present, the broad masses of workers on the industrial front are actively implementing Chairman Mao's wise decisions on learning from Daqing in industry, learning from Dazhai in agriculture, and learning from the People's Liberation Army nationwide, breaking through foreign frameworks, and taking their own path of industrial development, ensuring that our great socialist motherland is built into an ironclad bastion of the proletariat. At the same time, they insist on combining revolution with production, ensuring the over-fulfillment of this year's production tasks in a good, fast, and economical way, and striving for the successful implementation of the Third Five-Year Plan and for building our country into a powerful socialist state.

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, the broad masses of peasants and rural cadres across the country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promote everything, and transform everything, achieving one brilliant victory after another in the struggle to develop agricultural production. Now, the autumn harvest is being carried out on a large scale across the country, and some regions have basically completed it. From the coast of the East China Sea to the Pamir Plateau, from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia to the southernmost tip of Hainan Island, the vast rural areas of China are bustling with activity, and everywhere is a scene of joy.

The good news from various places indicates that the situation of China's agricultural production this year is very good. Whether it is grain crops or economic crops, whether it is plains, lake areas, or mountainous and hilly areas, everywhere is a scene of bumper harvests. From the actual yield of the harvested part of the crops and the growth of the unharvested part, grain crops, in addition to the continued increase in production of rice, which has seen significant increases in the past few years, will see a significant increase in production of dryland crops, which have seen less increase in the past few years; economic crops, including cotton, which has seen a reduction in planting area, and hemp and peanuts, which have seen little increase in the past few years, will generally see a significant increase in production. It is particularly worth noting that the originally low-yielding northern provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have seen significant increases in production this year, and the low-yield situation is undergoing tremendous changes. These situations strongly illustrate that, whether from the perspective of crops or regions, a new leap-forward situation has begun to emerge this year.

The overall increase in China's agricultural production this year is achieved under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and on the basis of continuous good harvests in the past four years. This year, various places have seriously summarized the experience of the past four years and further launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad masses of peasants and rural cadres, with unprecedented high revolutionary enthusiasm, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect, and first continuously improving their socialist consciousness. Under the leadership of advanced thinking, they are more active in consolidating and developing the collective economy of the commune and, relying on the powerful collective strength, have launched a mass movement for basic agricultural construction. This year, from south to north, especially in many northern regions, the scale, speed, and quality of basic agricultural construction are unprecedented in recent years. The effective irrigation area newly developed nationwide this year is approximately double that of last year; the newly built terraced fields, garden fields, platform fields, and strip fields are also several times more than last year; various places have significantly increased the planting of green manure crops. Over the past year, China's agricultural technological reforms, such as the area, cultivation techniques, and cultivation systems of rice, cotton, and other crops, have all seen new developments. In many regions, agricultural mechanization has gradually developed from nothing to something and from small to large. The use of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural plastic films has all significantly increased compared to last year, with fertilizers alone increasing by 400 million tons. All of these have played a major role in promoting agricultural increases this year.

China's agricultural production this year has been carried out under relatively heavy natural disasters. Whether in the south or the north, some regions have experienced severe droughts, with some regions experiencing droughts lasting more than 100 days to more than 200 days. In the southeastern coastal regions, there have been massive typhoons and floods. In Northeast China and North China, many regions have been severely affected by pests. However, the broad masses and cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought dare to struggle and dare to win, regarding natural disasters as paper tigers that can be overcome. They have highly promoted the spirit of fearlessness towards heaven and earth, relying on significantly improved material conditions, and have tenaciously fought against various natural disasters, overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory in agricultural increases.

Looking back on the journey of the past year, the broad masses of rural cadres and peasants unanimously believe that there are thousands of experiences of bumper harvests, but the most fundamental one is to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive unremittingly to successfully complete the Third Five-Year Plan.

    毛泽东思想是带动精神战线和物质战线前进的火车头
    全国工农业生产呈现全面跃进新局面
    工业：头八个月，生产计划超额完成，产品质量显著提高，突破世界水平的新纪录不断出现，对国民经济有重大作用的新产品接连问世，具有国际意义的科学技术成果相继诞生。
    农业：无论是粮食作物还是经济作物，无论是平原、湖区还是山区、丘陵区，到处是一片丰收景象。北方各省、市、自治区今年增产大都比较显著，低产面貌正在发生巨大变化。
    据新华社二十九日讯　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我国工业战线上的广大职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用火热的革命激情，无穷的智慧和力量，在精神战线和物质战线上冲锋陷阵，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利，同全国革命群众一道把我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设推向了新高潮。
    目前，工业战线上正在出现全面跃进的新局面。在举国欢腾庆祝新中国成立十七周年的前夕，生产捷报频频传来：生产计划超额完成，产品质量显著提高，突破世界水平的新纪录不断出现，对国民经济有重大作用的新产品接连问世，具有国际意义的科学技术成果相继诞生。全国工业总产值，在过去两年大幅度增长的基础上，今年头八个月又比去年同期增长了百分之二十以上；产品的数量、品种和质量都有很大发展和提高。特别是支援农业的化肥、农药、手扶拖拉机比去年同期增长了百分之四十到两倍多。钢铁、电力、石油、煤炭、机械等基础工业，以及满足人民生活需要的纺织、造纸、卷烟等工业，都比去年同期有较大幅度的增长。
    所有这些，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利。所有这些，都雄辩地说明：毛泽东思想是带动我国精神战线和物质战线前进的火车头，有毛泽东思想领先，有无产阶级文化大革命作为动力，就能有力地促进人的思想革命化，进一步发挥群众无限的积极性和创造性，就能产生巨大的物质力量，促进社会生产力的大发展。
    今年以来，在广大职工中掀起的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，是工业战线取得这一胜利的最根本的保证。广大职工怀着最深厚的阶级感情，最顽强的革命意志，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。特别在最近文化大革命的高潮中，他们经过自己的斗争实践，更加深刻地认识到：要挑起历史赋予我国工人阶级的伟大使命，不辜负世界革命人民对我国工人阶级的期望，必须用毛泽东思想武装自己，用毛泽东思想来指导自己的一切行动。
    毛泽东思想一旦掌握了群众，群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就使千千万万过去被资产阶级老爷们认为最“贫贱”、最“愚昧”的人变成了世界上最聪明、最勇敢、最有创造才能的人。他们在生产斗争和科学实验中敢想敢闯，藐视一切资产阶级“权威”，不断地打破洋框框、老框框，攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。一大批不知名的普通工人，成了攻克科学尖端的闯将，不少设备简陋的小厂，不断制造出具有世界水平的产品。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大职工活学活用毛主席关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论，坚决同一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争，坚决同资产阶级反动学术权威进行斗争，批判企业中形形色色的资本主义、修正主义的经营思想，进一步认清了办好社会主义企业的道路，树立了全心全意为人民服务的观点。“身在车间，胸怀祖国，放眼世界”的思想更加深入人心，共产主义精神大发扬。
    目前，我国工业战线广大职工正在积极贯彻执行毛主席提出的关于工业学大庆、农业学大寨、全国学人民解放军，打破洋框框，走自己工业发展道路，把工厂办成革命化的大学校等英明决策，保证把我们伟大的社会主义祖国建设成为无产阶级的铁打的江山。同时，他们坚持抓革命促生产，保证多快好省地全面超额完成今年的生产任务，为胜利地实现第三个五年计划、为把我国建设成为强大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    据新华社二十九日讯　我国广大农民群众和农村干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想统帅一切、推动一切、改造一切，在发展农业生产的斗争中取得了一个又一个的光辉胜利。现在，秋收正在全国各地大规模地进行，一部分地区已经基本收完。从东海之滨到帕米尔高原，从内蒙古草原到最南端的海南岛，我国广大农村到处热气腾腾，到处一片欢声。
    来自各地的喜讯表明，今年我国农业生产形势好得很。无论是粮食作物还是经济作物，无论是平原、湖区还是山区、丘陵区，到处是一片丰收景象。从已收部分的作物的实际产量和未收部分的作物长势来看，粮食作物，除前几年增产较多的水稻将持续增产外，前几年增产较少的旱粮作物，将有一个幅度较大的增产；经济作物，包括种植面积有所减少的棉花和过去几年很少增产的黄麻和花生在内，一般都将获得较大幅度的增产。特别值得重视的是：原来产量水平较低的北方各省、市、自治区，今年增产大都比较显著，低产面貌正在发生巨大变化。这些情况有力地说明，无论是从作物还是从地区上看，今年都开始出现了新的全面跃进的可喜局面。
    今年我国农业生产的全面增产，是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的指引下，在过去四年连续获得好收成的基础上取得的。今年，各地认真总结了过去四年的经验，进一步掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。广大农民群众和农村干部，以空前高涨的革命热情，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，首先不断地提高自己的社会主义觉悟。在先进思想领先的条件下，他们更加积极地巩固和发展公社集体经济，并依靠强大的集体力量，开展了农田基本建设的群众运动。这一年，从南到北，特别是北方的许多地区，农田基本建设规模之大、进度之快和质量之好，都是近几年来所没有的。全国一年来新发展的有效灌溉面积，比上年度大约增加一倍；新修的梯田、园田、台田和条田，也比上年度成倍增加；各地还显著地增种了绿肥作物。一年来，我国农业技术改革，如水稻、棉花和其他农作物的良种面积、栽培技术和耕作制度，都有了新发展。在不少的地区，农业机械化逐步地从无到有、从小到大地发展起来。化肥、农药和农用塑料薄膜的使用量，都比去年显著增加，其中仅化肥就增加了四百万吨。所有这些，都对今年的农业增产起了重大的促进作用。
    今年我国的农业生产是在自然灾害比较重的情况下进行的。无论是南方还是北方，都有一些地区发生严重的干旱，有的地区干旱持续达一百多天到二百多天。在东南沿海地区，曾遭到巨大台风和洪水的袭击。东北和华北有不少地区，粘虫为害很严重。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大群众和干部，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，把自然灾害看成是可以战胜的纸老虎。他们高度发扬天不怕、地不怕的大无畏精神，依靠已经大有改善的物质条件，向各种自然灾害顽强搏斗，排除万难，去争取农业增产的胜利。
    回顾一年来所走过的路，广大农村干部和群众一致认为，丰收经验千万条，最根本的一条就是读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为胜利完成第三个五年计划而奋斗不懈。
