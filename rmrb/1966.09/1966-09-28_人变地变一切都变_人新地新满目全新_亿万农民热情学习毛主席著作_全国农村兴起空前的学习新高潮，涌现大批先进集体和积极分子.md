The slogan "Study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively and thoroughly, above all else, greater than all else, before all else, and more important than all else" has been embraced by the hundreds of millions of farmers and rural cadres in our country. With profound class feelings of boundless love, faith, and reverence for Chairman Mao, they have launched a new high tide of the mass movement to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a material force for transforming society and the world. This year, our country's agricultural production has seen a new leap forward, once again proving this to be a universal truth.

The mass movement to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works has spread across the vast rural areas of our country, from north to south. In Guangdong Province, with a population of 40 million, approximately 10 million people are currently participating in the study. In Shanxi Province, about 80% of the rural labor force is engaged in learning. In Jiangsu Province, almost all members of communes that have undergone socialist education movements are participating in the study. In many other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the number of people participating in the study this year, the breadth of the scope, the depth of the content, and the magnitude of the effects have all surpassed any previous period.

A large number of advanced units and active individuals who have excelled in their studies have emerged. Places like Shanyin County and Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi, Baoting County and Huangshandong Brigade in Guangdong, Cangxi County in Sichuan, Jingdong County in Yunnan, Hongshan District in Hubei, Fangxiang Brigade in Jiangsu, Xiadingjia Brigade in Shandong, Xiejiazui Brigade in Gansu, Heyetang Production Team in Hunan, and Wubaili Production Team in Jiangxi, along with many other regions and units; cadres and commune members such as Chen Yonggui and Zhou Mingshan from Shanxi, Lv Yulan from Hebei, Huang Shanyu from Jilin, Song Ximing from Jiangxi, Liu Guangyou (adoptive mother of Zhang Side) from Sichuan, Gu Atao from Jiangsu, and Cao Dianshi from Liaoning, have all become models for actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In many advanced regions, every brigade has a study organization, and every household has Chairman Mao's books; men study, women study; young and strong people study, the elderly and children study; those who can read study, and those who cannot read study. Many people study Chairman Mao's works with the attitude that agricultural work will not overwhelm them, time will not overwhelm them, low culture will not overwhelm them, and heavy household chores will not overwhelm them.

The mass movement to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in our rural areas began with learning from the People's Liberation Army. In recent years, various places have, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, carried out socialist education movements and the Learn from Dazhai movement, further igniting the enthusiasm of the peasant masses and rural cadres for learning, and quickly forming a mass movement of unprecedented scale to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Many cadres and masses say: "Chairman Mao's books are the books that the poor of the world seek liberation and make revolution. When you read them in times of difficulty, courage comes; when you read them in times of problems, solutions come; when you read them in times of setbacks, confidence comes; when you read them in times of achievements, you won't become arrogant."

The broad masses of peasants and rural cadres, following the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao, study with problems in mind, actively study and apply, integrate learning with use, learn first what is urgently needed, and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldviews, carrying out a thought revolution of eliminating private interests and establishing public interests. Now, the spirits of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the old fool who moved mountains have become the examples for the broad masses of peasants and rural cadres to learn from; the fundamental viewpoints in the articles "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" are increasingly becoming the guidelines for people's actions. The broad masses of peasants further free themselves from the shackles of private ownership, establishing a revolutionary worldview of serving the revolution by farming for the people and serving the people. For example, Hou Yulan, a female commune member from Fangxiang Brigade, Fangxiang Commune, Yanjiang County, Jiangsu Province, was originally an ordinary rural woman. During the socialist education movement, she studied Chairman Mao's works, raised her class consciousness, joined the Communist Party of China, and later was elected as the deputy secretary of the brigade party branch, working very actively. Ma Guanying, a female commune member from Huangshandong Brigade, Shibazhou Commune, Boluo County, Guangdong Province, used to be selfish and liked to quarrel. Since last year, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," her spiritual outlook has changed greatly, becoming a good commune member who maintains the collective, works hard, and cares for others. Dongliugou Brigade, Zhangsanzhai Commune, Linxi County, Hebei Province, through the study of Chairman Mao's works, launched a debate between "cleverness" and "foolishness." The five "great fools" who devoted themselves to the collective, such as Lv Yulan and Hua Yulin, were universally praised by the commune members; a few "little clever ones" who only thought of themselves were criticized by the commune members.

The broad masses of rural cadres and commune members use Chairman Mao's class and class struggle theory to correctly carry out the struggle between the two roads. In the socialist education movement, they repelled the attacks of class enemies and capitalist forces, defended the collective economy, and adhered to the socialist direction. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have joined the struggle to criticize the bourgeoisie, defending Mao Zedong Thought and the socialist cause.

The broad masses of peasants use Mao Zedong Thought, this invincible ideological weapon, to struggle against nature and the land, achieving one victory after another in production struggles and scientific experiments. This year, our country's wheat and early-season rice have already yielded good harvests, and the autumn crops are currently growing well, ensuring a bumper harvest. Facing this prosperous socialist scene, the farmers from the bottom of their hearts sing praises: "Wherever Mao Zedong Thought goes, people change, the land changes, the villages change, everything changes; people are new, the land is new, the mountains and forests are new, everything is new."

    人变地变一切都变　人新地新满目全新
    亿万农民热情学习毛主席著作
    全国农村兴起空前的学习新高潮，涌现大批先进集体和积极分子
    据新华社二十七日讯　“活学活用毛主席著作，高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切”。我国亿万农民群众和农村干部，怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的深厚阶级感情，兴起了波澜壮阔的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动的新高潮。毛泽东思想一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。今年，我国农业生产出现了新的全面跃进的局面，又一次证明了这是一个普遍的真理。
    活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，已经遍及我国南北广大农村。在四千万人的广东省，目前已有约一千万人参加学习。山西省参加学习的农民约占农村劳动力总数的百分之八十。江苏省凡是经过社会主义教育运动的地区，差不多全部社员都参加学习。其他许多省、市、自治区的广大农村，今年以来参加学习的人数之多，范围之广，学习内容之深和效果之大，都超过以往任何一个时期。
    学习得好的先进单位和积极分子大批大批地涌现。像山西的汾阳县、大寨大队，广东的保亭县、黄山洞大队，四川的苍溪县，云南的景东县，湖北的洪山区，江苏的方巷大队，山东的下丁家大队，甘肃的歇家咀大队，湖南的荷叶塘生产队，江西的五百里生产队等许多地区和单位；山西的陈永贵、周明山，河北的吕玉兰，吉林的黄顺玉，江西的宋喜明，四川的刘光友（张思德的养母），江苏的顾阿桃，辽宁的曹殿仕等许多干部和社员，都已成为活学活用毛主席著作的模范。许多先进地区，队队有学习组织，家家有毛主席的书；男的学，女的也学；青壮年学，老年、儿童也学；识字的学，不识字的也学。许多人学习毛主席著作做到：农活忙，压不倒；时间紧，挤不倒；文化低，难不倒；家务重，累不倒。
    我国农村活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，是从学习解放军开始的。近几年，各地按照党中央和毛主席的指示，开展了社会主义教育运动和学大寨运动，进一步激发了农民群众和农村干部的学习积极性，活学活用毛主席著作很快形成为规模空前宏伟的群众运动。许多干部和群众说：“毛主席的书，是天下穷人求解放、闹革命的书。在遇到困难的时候读了，勇气就来；在出现问题的时候读了，办法就来；在遭受挫折的时候读了，信心就来；在取得成绩的时候读了，就不会翘尾巴。”
    广大农民和农村干部按照林彪同志的指示，带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，进行破私立公、灭资兴无的思想革命。现在，张思德、白求恩、老愚公的精神，已经成为广大农民和农村干部学习的榜样；《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》《愚公移山》几篇文章中的基本观点，正越来越广泛地成为人们行动的准则。广大农民进一步摆脱私有观念的束缚，树立胸怀祖国，放眼世界，为革命种田，为人民服务的革命人生观。像江苏省邗江县方巷公社方巷大队女社员侯玉兰，原来是个普通的农村妇女，在社教运动中，她学习了毛主席著作，提高了阶级觉悟，加入了中国共产党，后来又被选为大队党支部副书记，工作很积极。广东省博罗县石坝公社黄山洞大队女社员马观妹过去私心重，好吵架。去年以来，她学习《为人民服务》《纪念白求恩》后，精神面貌起了很大的变化，成了维护集体、积极劳动、关心别人的好社员。河北省临西县张三寨公社东留善固大队，通过学习毛主席著作，展开一场“精”与“傻”的论争。一心为集体的“五大傻”吕玉兰、华岳林等五人，受到社员的普遍赞扬；几个专为自己打算盘的“小精人”，受到了社员的批判。
    广大农村干部和社员运用毛主席的阶级、阶级斗争的理论，正确地开展两条道路的斗争，在社会主义教育运动中，打退了阶级敌人和资本主义势力的进攻，保卫了集体经济，坚持了社会主义方向。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，他们又投入批判资产阶级的斗争，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫社会主义江山。
    广大农民运用毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的思想武器，跟天斗，跟地斗，在生产斗争和科学实验方面夺得一个又一个的新胜利。今年，我国小麦和早稻已经获得了好收成，目前秋季作物生长良好，丰产年景已定。农民们面对这一片社会主义的兴旺景象，从内心发出了赞颂：“毛泽东思想的威力所向，人变，地变，村庄变，一切都变；人新，地新，山林新，满目全新。”
