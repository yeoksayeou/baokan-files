The friendly delegation of the Somali National Assembly, led by Speaker Mukhtar, has traveled across the ocean and arrived in Beijing today. The Chinese people are very pleased and, in the new high tide of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we warmly welcome friends from the distant "Horn of Africa."

The Somali people have a glorious history of struggle against imperialism and colonialism. To fight for national independence and freedom, the Somali people have bravely and persistently struggled for a long time, finally overthrowing colonial rule and establishing the first republic in East Africa. Since gaining independence, Somalia has actively pursued a policy of peace and neutrality, making effective efforts to consolidate national independence and develop the national economy.

Currently, the peoples of Asia and Africa face a common task of struggle: to resolutely defeat imperialist aggression and interference, to thoroughly eliminate imperialist influence in all aspects of economics, politics, military, and culture, and to smash imperialist attempts to regain control over the Asian and African continents. There is no middle ground here. Therefore, the primary task for the peoples of Asia and Africa at present is to carry on the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism to the end, achieving complete and unconditional political and economic independence.

Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle against imperialism as their own victories, and they give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their struggles against imperialism and colonialism." The Chinese people applaud the achievements already made by the Somali people and firmly support the anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles of the Somali people and the peoples of other African countries.

We sincerely wish the friendly delegation of the Somali National Assembly a successful visit to China.

    热烈欢迎索马里朋友
    由穆克塔尔议长率领的索马里国民议会友好代表团，远涉重洋，在今天到达北京。中国人民感到十分高兴，在我国无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，欢迎来自“非洲之角”的远方朋友。
    索马里人民有着光荣的反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争历史。为了争取民族独立和自由，索马里人民前赴后继，坚持长期的英勇斗争，终于推翻了殖民统治，在东非建立了第一个共和国。索马里独立以来，积极奉行和平中立政策，为巩固民族独立和发展民族经济，进行了有效的努力。
    目前，亚非人民面临着一个共同的斗争任务，这就是坚决打败帝国主义的侵略和干涉，彻底肃清帝国主义在经济、政治、军事、文化等一切方面的势力，粉碎帝国主义的疯狂反扑和企图重新主宰亚非大陆的阴谋。这里没有中间选择的余地。因此，我们亚非人民当前的首要任务，就是要把反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争进行到底，实现完全的不折不扣的政治独立和经济独立。
    毛主席说：“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”中国人民欢呼索马里人民已经取得的成就，并且最坚决地支持索马里人民和非洲各国人民的反帝反殖斗争。
    我们衷心地祝索马里国民议会友好代表团访华成功。
