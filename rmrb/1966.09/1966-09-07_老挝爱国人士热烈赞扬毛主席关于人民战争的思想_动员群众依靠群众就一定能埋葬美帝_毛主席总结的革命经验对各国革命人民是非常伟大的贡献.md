Lao patriotic figures warmly praise Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war.
Mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and definitely bury the U.S. imperialists.
Chairman Mao's summary of revolutionary experience is a great contribution to the revolutionary people of all countries.

KANGA, Sept. 5 (Xinhua) -- A representative of the Lao Patriotic Front Central Committee, Nouhak Phoumsavanh, recently said in a speech: Chairman Mao Zedong's summary of experiences on people's war not only made a great contribution to the Chinese revolution but also has special and great significance for the people of all countries who are fighting against imperialism and for national liberation.

Nouhak said, the Lao people have applied Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war in the past eleven years of anti-American patriotic struggle and achieved great victories. Currently, Laos mainly relies on regular troops, local forces, and militia guerrillas to wage people's war. Armed struggle, mobilizing the masses, and developing production are the three major tasks of the Lao patriotic armed forces. The Lao Patriotic Front, according to the specific situation in Laos, correctly implemented the policy of a broad united front, gradually transforming the patriotic armed forces from weak to strong. On the basis of self-reliance, efforts are being made to build liberated areas, making the liberated areas politically and economically solid anti-American and national salvation bases.

Nouhak emphasized: Only by waging people's war can the spiritual and material strength of the masses be mobilized, difficulties be overcome, and a protracted war be waged to defeat the most ferocious and rampant imperialism like U.S. imperialism and achieve final victory.

Nouhak finally said: "The Lao people, relying on people's war, won the nine-year war against the French and won the eleven-year anti-American patriotic struggle. We firmly believe that on the road of people's war, no matter how ferocious the U.S. imperialists are, no matter how much military aid the U.S. imperialists give to the rightist forces in Laos, the final victory will definitely belong to the Lao people."

KANGA, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- The director of the "Voice of Laos" radio station, Vang Heu, recently spoke, warmly praising Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts on people's war.

He said: "People's war is one of Chairman Mao Zedong's greatest and most outstanding creations. It has made an extremely great contribution to the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Because it completely solves a fundamental problem, that is, how a poor and weak nation can defeat imperialism that is addicted to plunder and traitorous reactionaries." Vang Heu also said, "Lin Biao's article 'Long Live the Victory of People's War' once again fully and clearly expounded on this issue, thereby enhancing the revolutionary people's confidence and courage to dare to strike and defeat imperialism and all reactionaries."

Vang Heu emphasized: The Lao people, from their personal experience, deeply understand that Lin Biao's exposition on people's war is very correct and very effective. People's war is a just war and will definitely win. Imperialist aggression is an unjust war, no matter how much modern equipment and weapons it has, it is doomed to fail.

Vang Heu said, currently, U.S. imperialism in Laos is implementing the so-called "divide and rule" and "Lao people killing Lao people" policy, cruelly and barbarically invading Laos. Faced with a serious national crisis, the Lao patriotic armed forces correctly implemented the line of people's war, fighting while building, liberating including many important cities and half of the population of three-fifths of the territory. Today, the Lao patriotic armed forces have developed into a strong anti-American and national salvation armed force.

    老挝爱国人士热烈赞扬毛主席关于人民战争的思想
    动员群众依靠群众就一定能埋葬美帝
    毛主席总结的革命经验对各国革命人民是非常伟大的贡献
    新华社康开五日电  老挝爱国战线党中央代表诺哈·冯沙万最近发表谈话说：毛泽东主席总结的关于人民战争的经验，不仅对中国革命作出了巨大的贡献，而且对正在为反对帝国主义和争取民族解放而斗争的各国人民有特别重大的意义。
    诺哈说，老挝人民运用了毛主席关于人民战争的思想，在过去十一年的反美爱国斗争中，取得了伟大的胜利。目前老挝主要依靠正规军、地方部队、民兵游击队进行人民战争。武装斗争、动员群众、发展生产是老挝爱国武装力量的三大任务。老挝爱国战线党根据老挝的具体情况，正确地执行了广泛的统一战线的政策，使爱国武装力量逐步由弱变强；在自力更生的基础上，努力建设解放区，使解放区成为在政治上、经济上巩固的抗美救国根据地。
    诺哈强调指出：只有进行人民战争，才能调动群众的精神和物质力量，克服困难，进行持久战，才能打败像美帝国主义这样最凶恶、最猖狂的帝国主义，取得最后胜利。
    诺哈最后说：“老挝人民依靠人民战争，取得了九年抗法战争的胜利，取得了十一年反美爱国斗争的胜利。我们坚信：在人民战争的道路上，不管美帝国主义多么凶恶，不管美帝国主义给老挝右派势力多少军事援助，最后胜利一定属于老挝人民。”
    新华社康开四日电  “老挝之声”电台负责人温亨最近发表谈话，热烈赞扬毛泽东主席的人民战争思想。
    他说：“人民战争是毛泽东主席最伟大、最卓越的创作之一，它对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲被压迫民族的解放运动作出了非常伟大的贡献。因为它完全解决了一个最基本的问题，这就是：一个贫苦、弱小的民族怎样才能战胜掠夺成性的帝国主义和卖国的反动派。”温亨还说，“林彪的《人民战争胜利万岁》这篇文章再次全面地、清晰地论述了这个问题，从而增强了革命人民敢于打击和战胜帝国主义以及一切反动派的信心和勇气。”
    温亨强调说：老挝人民从自己的亲身经历中深刻地认识到林彪关于人民战争的论述是非常正确、非常有效的。人民战争是正义的战争，一定会胜利。帝国主义的侵略战争是非正义的战争，不管它有多少现代化的装备和武器，是注定要失败的。
    温亨说，目前，美帝国主义在老挝正在推行所谓“分而治之”和“老挝人杀老挝人”的政策，残酷地、野蛮地侵略老挝。面对着严重的民族危机，老挝爱国武装力量正确地执行了人民战争的路线，一面战斗，一面建设，解放了包括有许多重要城市和有一半人口的五分之三的国土。今天，老挝爱国武装力量已经发展成为一支反美救国斗争的坚强的武装部队。
