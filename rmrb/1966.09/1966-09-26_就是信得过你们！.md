In Nepal, a Chinese expert team's doctor once treated a Nepalese farmer whose leg had been broken by a falling stone. The Chinese doctor immediately had him lie on his own bed and performed a bone-setting operation. After the farmer returned home, the doctor was still not at ease, climbing over a thousand meters of mountain and walking seven or eight li to change the farmer's dressing every day. More than a month later, the farmer's leg had healed. His family specially sent someone to the expert team, holding the doctor's hand and repeatedly saying, "The Chinese doctors are so good! So good!"

Another time, in Banskar, an old woman fell ill, but the Chinese doctors happened not to be there. Although there were doctors from the American "Peace Corps" there, she insisted on waiting for three days, determined to wait for the Chinese doctors to return to treat her. She said, "Chinese doctors, I just trust you!"

    “就是信得过你们！”
    在尼泊尔，有次中国专家组的医生接收了一个被石头砸断腿的尼泊尔农民。中国大夫立即把他安置在自己床上，进行了接骨手术。这位农民回去后，大夫还不放心，每天爬一千多米高山，走七八里地，给这位农民换药。一个多月后，这位农民的腿长好了。他们家里专门派人到专家组，拉着医生的手，不断地说：“中国医生太好啦！太好啦！”
    又一次，在巴斯卡尔，一位老大娘病了，中国的医生恰好不在那里。尽管那里有美国“和平队的医生”，但她还是坚持等了三天，非要等中国大夫回来给她治。她说：“中国大夫啊，我就是信得过你们！”
