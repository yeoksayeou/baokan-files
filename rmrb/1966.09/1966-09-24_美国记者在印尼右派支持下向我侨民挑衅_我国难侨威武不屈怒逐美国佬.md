	American journalists, with the support of Indonesian rightists, provoked Chinese overseas compatriots. Chinese refugees bravely drove out the American intruders.

	YAKARTA, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) — Hundreds of Chinese refugees waiting in Medan for ships from their motherland to take them back home bravely resisted the insulting behavior of a U.S. National Broadcasting Company (NBC) television crew on Sept. 21.

	According to reports, these Chinese compatriots, who were forced to relocate to Medan by the Indonesian authorities in North Sumatra, threw stones at the American crew attempting to film them for anti-China propaganda. The refugees shouted slogans: "Smash U.S. imperialism!"

	The rightist military regime in Indonesia sent fully armed riot police to threaten the refugees with gunshots. However, the refugees were not intimidated. They bravely threw stones and bottles at the police in self-defense. Earlier, on Sept. 12 and 13, American journalists had intruded into the residences of the refugees in Medan, attempting to take photographs for anti-China propaganda. The refugees resolutely prevented the Americans from taking photos and shouted angrily: "Drive out the U.S. imperialists!" The American journalists fled in fear.

	Just as China was dispatching ships to Indonesia to bring back the refugees waiting to return home, this provocative action by the Indonesian rightist military regime in collusion with U.S. imperialism shows their intention to obstruct and sabotage China's efforts to repatriate its compatriots.

    美国记者在印尼右派支持下向我侨民挑衅
    我国难侨威武不屈怒逐美国佬
    新华社二十三日讯  雅加达消息：正在印度尼西亚棉兰等待祖国派船接回国的受害华侨数百人，二十一日对美国全国广播公司电视组企图拍摄他们的电影的侮辱行动，进行了英勇的抗击。
    据报道，这些被印尼亚齐当局无理迫迁后到达棉兰的受害华侨，向企图进行反华宣传的美国佬扔石块，制止这些人进行拍摄工作，同时还高呼口号：粉碎美帝国主义！
    印尼右派军人政权竟派遣了全副武装的宪兵，鸣枪威胁华侨。但是华侨并没有被吓倒，他们为了自卫，英勇地向军警扔出石头和瓶子。在这以前，在十二、十三日两天，有美国记者闯入集中在棉兰的受害华侨的住所，企图拍摄照片，进行反华宣传。受害华侨坚决不让美国佬拍照，愤怒地大声高呼：“赶走美帝国主义者！”吓得美国记者抱头逃走。
    正当中国派船前往印尼接运等待回国的难侨的时候，印尼右派军人政权勾结美帝国主义进行的这一挑衅行动表明，他们蓄意多方阻挠和破坏中国的接侨工作。
