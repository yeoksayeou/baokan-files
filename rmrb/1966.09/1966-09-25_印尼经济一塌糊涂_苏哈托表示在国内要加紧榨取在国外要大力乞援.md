Indonesia's economy is in shambles. The right-wing military regime, which has taken power, has made a mess of the country's economy. The regime's leader, Suharto, recently admitted that Indonesia's economic situation is extremely dire. He stated that the country needs to intensify domestic exploitation and seek more "aid" from the United States and other Western countries.

On the 20th, Suharto spoke on the Jakarta radio, saying that Indonesia's economic difficulties are becoming increasingly severe, and by the middle of this year, the situation had reached a critical point. He acknowledged that Indonesia is experiencing severe inflation and has a massive budget deficit.

According to a recent report by the Indonesian newspaper *Aksi*, Suharto said that Indonesia needs two types of foreign "aid": deferment of old debts and new loans.

To beg for foreign "aid," the Indonesian right-wing military regime has already sent delegations to the United States, Japan, and other countries to lobby for support.

    印尼经济一塌糊涂
    苏哈托表示在国内要加紧榨取在国外要大力乞援
    据新华社二十一日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权上台以来，把印尼经济搞得一团糟。这个政权头目苏哈托最近公开承认，印尼的经济情况已经到了危急的程度。他表示要在国内加紧进行榨取，并且向美国等西方国家乞讨更多的“援助”。
    苏哈托二十日在雅加达电台发表讲话说，印尼经济困难愈来愈严重，今年年中已到了十分危急的时期。他承认印尼通货膨胀极其猛烈，预算赤字庞大。
    据印尼《行动报》最近报道，苏哈托说，印尼需要外国给予两种“援助”，即推迟偿还旧债和给予新的贷款。
    为了乞讨外“援”，印尼右派军人政权已经派了一些代表团到美国、日本等国家去活动。
