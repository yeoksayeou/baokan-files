Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Strongly Condemns Johnson's Bandit Rhetoric
U.S. Aggressor Troops Must Withdraw Completely from South Vietnam
Vietnamese People's Resolute Struggle to Defend National Independence Will Ultimately Achieve Victory

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, September 10 — The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on September 9 strongly condemning U.S. President Johnson's recent announcement of his policy of continuing aggression against Vietnam.

	The statement pointed out that U.S. President Johnson recently claimed that if North Vietnam sets a date for withdrawing North Vietnamese troops from South Vietnam, he is also prepared at any time to set a date for withdrawing U.S. troops from South Vietnam. Johnson's absurd remarks exposed the U.S. imperialists' ambition to remain in South Vietnam.

	The statement said, Vietnam is thousands of miles away from the United States. The Vietnamese people have never invaded the United States. Therefore, the U.S. sending troops to invade South Vietnam, the U.S. aircraft's frenzied bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the U.S. aggressors' heinous crimes in Vietnam have aroused the increasingly strong indignation of peace-loving people around the world. The call for the U.S. to stop aggression and withdraw all U.S. troops and their puppet forces from Vietnam resonates around the world.

	The statement pointed out that the isolated and besieged U.S. imperialists fabricated the absurd theory of Vietnamese invading Vietnam, attempting to justify their banditry. Now, they shamelessly propose conditions for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, which in essence means that the U.S. wants the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and surrender, allowing it to rule South Vietnam.

	The statement said, the U.S. government is the aggressor. The U.S. government has no right to demand any conditions from the Vietnamese people regarding the withdrawal of U.S. aggressor troops from South Vietnam. The U.S. government has no right to demand any conditions from the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam regarding the cessation of bombing North Vietnam. If the U.S. stops aggression and withdraws all U.S. troops and their puppet forces from South Vietnam, then peace in Vietnam will be immediately restored. If the U.S. continues to aggress against Vietnam, the Vietnamese people will resolutely resist to defend national sovereignty and independence, and contribute to the defense of peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

	The statement pointed out that the more obstinate the U.S. aggressors are, the more shameful their defeat will be. The Vietnamese people will surely defeat the U.S. aggressor bandits and achieve the ultimate victory.

    越南外交部发言人强烈谴责约翰逊强盗论调
    美国侵略军必须全部从南越撤走
    越南人民坚决维护祖国独立的斗争必将取得最后胜利
    新华社河内十日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人九日发表声明，强烈谴责美国总统约翰逊最近宣布的坚持侵略越南的强盗政策。
    声明指出，美国总统约翰逊最近宣称，如果北越定出日期把北越军队撤出南越，他也将随时准备定出日期把美国军队撤出南越。约翰逊的这一荒诞论调，暴露了美帝国主义要死赖在越南南方的野心。
    声明说，越南远离美国万里。越南人民从来没有侵犯过美国。因此，美国出兵侵略越南南方，美国飞机对越南民主共和国的疯狂轰炸，美国侵略者在越南犯下的滔天罪行，激起了全世界爱好和平人民日益强烈的愤慨。美国必须停止侵略，必须把美军和它的帮凶军全部从越南撤走的呼声响彻世界各地。
    声明指出，被孤立和陷于窘境的美帝国主义捏造了越南人侵略越南的荒唐谬论，妄图为它的强盗行径辩解。现在它竟然厚颜无耻地就美国撤军提出条件，实质是美国要越南人民放下武器投降，任它统治越南南方。
    声明说，美国政府是侵略者。美国政府完全无权就美国侵略军撤出越南南方问题要求越南人民接受任何条件。美国政府无权就停止轰炸越南北方问题要求越南民主共和国政府接受任何条件。美国停止侵略，并且把美国军队和它的帮凶军全部从越南南方撤走，那么，越南的和平就会立即恢复。美国继续侵略越南，越南人民就要坚决抵抗，以维护民族的主权和祖国的独立，为保卫东南亚和世界和平作出贡献。
    声明指出，美国侵略者越顽固，它就越遭到更加可耻的失败。越南人民必将战胜美国侵略强盗，夺取最后胜利。
