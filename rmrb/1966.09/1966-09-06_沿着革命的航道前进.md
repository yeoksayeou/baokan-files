Chairman Mao has repeatedly received revolutionary masses, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has surged to one high tide after another. Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the Sixteen Points, and we are now more clear-sighted and resolute. The Sixteen Points are our weapons in battle, the Sixteen Points are our magic talisman for victory, the Sixteen Points are our beacon for navigation, and the Sixteen Points are our broad and smooth path forward. We must thoroughly, comprehensively, and conscientiously implement the Sixteen Points. We must carry out the Sixteen Points without any deviation. The resplendent light of Mao Zedong Thought is illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and resolutely carry the socialist revolution through to the end. The great helmsman has opened up the revolutionary course for us, and we will forever follow him to create a new world!
