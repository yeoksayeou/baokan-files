What kind of ideals should new people of socialism have? The great ideal is to arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and strive for the realization of communism throughout China and the world. What kind of feelings should new people of socialism have? To breathe and share the fate with the three billion unliberated people in the world, to serve all the people of China and the world, this is our deepest proletarian feelings. What kind of interests should new people of socialism have? To struggle against nature, to struggle against the earth, to struggle against people, to change the heavens and the earth, to make revolution, this is our greatest revolutionary joy.

These are the most rich thoughts, the most rich feelings, and the most rich interests of the proletariat.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang, however, maliciously curses us as having "simple minds, simple feelings, and simple interests," and proposes his own fallacious theory that "people of socialism should have rich thoughts, rich feelings, and rich interests."

What is the true nature of the "three riches" that Zhou Yang is vigorously promoting?

The "rich thoughts" that Zhou Yang is promoting everywhere are anti-party and anti-socialist reactionary thoughts. Whoever deviates from the party's principles and policies, Zhou Yang praises as a "writer with thoughts" or a "person with a brain"; whoever follows Chairman Mao's words and creates according to Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, Zhou Yang condemns as having a "simple mind" and "no thoughts of his own." If one enriches one's mind according to Zhou Yang's "rich thoughts," the more "rich" the thoughts, the more reactionary the mind will become, ultimately turning into an unrepentant granite head!

The "rich feelings" that Zhou Yang talks about are bourgeois feelings, bourgeois human emotions. The "Communist Party member" Yinghua in the film *North of the Yangtze River* is such a character with "rich feelings." Tears are the characteristic of Yinghua's feelings. She does not use the proletarian worldview to transform people and the world, but uses tears, "virtue," and "motherly love" to "move," "educate," and "transform" people. This is not the feeling of a Communist Party member at all, but pure bourgeois feelings. Using the tearful Yinghua to peddle bourgeois "humanism," this is the reason why the black gang praises *North of the Yangtze River* so much for its "feelings."

"Rich interests" are another "product" under the control of Zhou Yang's "rich thoughts." These interests are low-level and vulgar. The film *The Soccer Fan* is a "masterpiece" that Zhou Yang praises for having "rich interests." The "positive character" Wang Lide in the film has no interest in work; his only "rich interest" is watching and playing soccer. For a ticket to a soccer match, he goes crazy and uses all kinds of hooligan tactics. How can he still look like a worker! All the people in the entire film are a bunch of egoists, fighting, cheating, and backstabbing each other for a ticket. In Zhou Yang's eyes, vulgar conversations, gambling for drinks, strange clothes, and civilized sticks... are all "rich interests." What kind of interests are these? They are completely the interests of hooligans and playboys!

It is not difficult to see that the "three riches" that Zhou Yang is promoting are bourgeois "rich thoughts," bourgeois "rich feelings," and bourgeois "rich interests." The more "rich" these thoughts, feelings, and interests are, the more filthy the soul becomes.

Zhou Yang himself is indeed a living specimen of the "three riches." As early as more than twenty years ago, Zhou Yang was extremely dissatisfied with Yan'an at that time and complained a lot. He said that life in Yan'an was "monotonous," "boring," and "uncomfortable." Everyone knows that Yan'an was the holy land of the revolution, the hope of all the people in China at that time. Everyone yearned for it and loved it because it was full of fresh political air and rich revolutionary life. But when Zhou Yang went there, he felt "dazzled," "painful," and "disappointed." So, what kind of "rich" "thoughts, feelings, and interests" does he want to pursue? Isn't it clear?

Zhou Yang's reactionary thoughts, corrupt feelings, and low-level interests have been getting "richer" from the 1930s to the 1960s!

Zhou Yang's "richness" in literature and art is to worship foreign cultures and restore old ones. He always praises Chernyshevsky and Stanislavsky, admiring them so much that he calls them the "Marx of literature" and "great Skis." He promotes works like *La Dame aux Camélias*, *Romeo and Juliet*, *The Storm*, *Wagang Village*, and *The Peony Pavilion* everywhere, wanting these things to "enrich" our literary and artistic stage! Zhou Yang's black head is indeed very "rich"!

Zhou Yang's "feelings" are also very "rich." He is cold to workers, peasants, and soldiers, but has deep feelings for landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. He cares deeply for the family of a landlord with heinous crimes, and for his old friend Lin Boshen (a rightist), his favorite disciple Kong Jue (a bad element), and the traitor Zhou Zuoren, he comforts and praises them, showing how deep his "feelings" are! This is pure landlord and bourgeois feelings. Zhou Yang is so affectionate, his purpose is to unite landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, to expand his forces, and to attempt a comeback.

Zhou Yang's "interests" are even more "rich." In addition to highly praising a pile of reactionary, low-level, and vulgar films like *Drafting Soldiers*, *Big Li, Little Li, and Old Li*, and *The Soccer Fan*, he is also very interested in and studies hard the "lifestyle and movements of prostitutes and mistresses," "celestial gods and earthly animals," and "sleeve-swinging and plum-blossom fingers."

Zhou Yang's thoughts, feelings, and interests cannot be said to be "rich and colorful." Zhou Yang is indeed a living specimen of bourgeois and revisionist "three riches"!

The "three riches" that Zhou Yang is promoting are, in essence, an attempt to turn the socialist literary and artistic stage into a black dyeing vat of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, using bourgeois thoughts, bourgeois feelings, and bourgeois interests to corrupt people's minds, in order to achieve his goal of "peaceful evolution" and the restoration of capitalism.

Zhou Yang is always shouting about being "reasonable and understanding," isn't he? We, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals, understand the feelings of the proletariat and the reason of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We can only thoroughly detest, criticize, and discard the thoughts, feelings, and interests of the bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao teaches us to be "a noble person, a pure person, a person with morality, a person who has shed low-level interests, and a person who benefits the people." We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly smash Zhou Yang's black dyeing vat of "three riches," and thoroughly eliminate all bourgeois and revisionist dregs. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought, temper ourselves into new people of communism who have lofty revolutionary ideals, deep proletarian feelings, and noble interests!

    在周扬的“三丰富”背后
    解放军某部　徐芝祥
    社会主义的新人应该有什么样的理想？用毛泽东思想武装头脑，为在全中国、全世界实现共产主义而奋斗，这就是我们的伟大理想。
    社会主义的新人应该有什么样的感情？和世界上三分之二没有解放的人民同呼吸、共命运，为全中国人民和全世界人民服务，这就是我们最深厚的无产阶级感情。
    社会主义的新人应该有什么样的趣味？与天斗争，与地斗争，与人斗争，改天换地闹革命，这就是我们最大的革命乐趣。
    这些，就是我们无产阶级最丰富的思想，最丰富的感情，最丰富的趣味。
    反革命修正主义分子周扬，却恶毒地咒骂我们这是“头脑简单、感情简单、趣味简单”，提出了他那套所谓“社会主义的人应该具有丰富的思想、丰富的感情、丰富的趣味”的谬论。
    周扬竭力鼓吹的“三丰富”究竟是什么货色呢？
    周扬到处鼓吹的“丰富的思想”，就是反党、反社会主义的反动思想。谁要是离开了党性和党的政策的立场，周扬就捧他是“有思想的作家”，“很有头脑的人”；谁要是听毛主席的话，按照毛泽东文艺思想去创作，周扬就骂他是“头脑简单”，“自己没有思想”。如果按照周扬的“丰富思想”去“丰富”头脑，那么思想越“丰富”，头脑就越反动，最后会变成至死不悟的花岗岩脑袋！
    周扬所说的“丰富的感情”，就是资产阶级的感情，资产阶级的人情。影片《北国江南》中的“共产党员”银花，就是这么一个有“丰富感情”的人物。眼泪成了银花的感情特征。她不是用无产阶级世界观去改造人、改造世界，而是用眼泪，用“贤惠”和“母爱”去“感动”人、“教育”人、“改造”人。这根本不是一个共产党员的感情，而是十足的资产阶级感情。利用流着眼泪的银花贩卖资产阶级的“人性论”，这就是周扬黑帮对《北国江南》那样有“感情”的原因。
    “丰富的趣味”，这是在周扬“丰富的思想”支配下的又一个“产物”。这种趣味，是低级、庸俗的趣味。影片《球迷》就是周扬所赞赏的，有“丰富趣味”的“杰作”。影片中的“正面人物”王立德，对工作毫无兴趣，他唯一的“丰富趣味”是看球、踢球。为了一张球票，他疯疯癫癫，耍尽流氓手段，哪里还像个工人！整个影片中的人也都是一群利己主义者，为了一张球票，他们欺闹斗骂、尔虞我诈。在周扬看来，下流对话，猜拳夺物，奇装异服，文明棍勾头……，都是“丰富的趣味”。这是什么趣味？完全是流氓阿飞的趣味！
    不难看出，周扬所鼓吹的“三丰富”，就是资产阶级的“丰富思想”，资产阶级的“丰富感情”，资产阶级的“丰富趣味”。这种思想、感情、趣味越是“丰富”，灵魂就越是肮脏。
    周扬本人也正是“三丰富”的活标本。早在二十多年前，周扬对当时的延安就极为不满，大发牢骚。说延安的生活“千篇一律”、“单调”、“不舒服”。大家知道，延安是革命的圣地，是当时全中国人民的希望。大家向往它、热爱它，因为那里充满了新鲜的政治空气和丰富的战斗生活。而周扬到了那里却感到“刺目”，“痛苦”，“失望”。那么，他究竟要追求什么样的“丰富”的“思想、感情、趣味”，难道还不明白吗？
    周扬的反动思想、腐朽感情、低级趣味，从三十年代到六十年代，真是一天比一天“丰富”！
    周扬在文艺上的“丰富”，就是崇洋复古。他成天吹捧车尔尼雪夫斯基、史坦尼斯拉夫斯基，对他们佩服得五体投地，称他们是“改造文学的马克思”、“很大的斯基”。他到处推荐《茶花女》《罗密欧与朱丽叶》《大雷雨》《瓦岗寨》《桃花扇》等作品，要让这些货色来“丰富”我们的文艺舞台！周扬的黑脑袋可算是“丰富”极了！
    周扬的“感情”也很“丰富”，他对工农兵冷若冰霜，对地富反坏右则是情长意深。他对恶贯满盈的地主家庭关怀备至，对他的老友林伯森（右派分子）、得意门生孔厥（坏分子）、汉奸周作人百般照顾，又是“安慰”，又是吹捧，多深的“感情”呀！这是地地道道的地主感情、资产阶级感情。周扬如此多情，其目的是拉拢地富反坏右，扩大阵容，妄想卷土重来。
    周扬的“趣味”更是“丰富”，除了对《抓壮丁》《大李小李和老李》《球迷》等一堆反动的低级庸俗的影片大加赞赏外，对“妓女、少奶奶的生活方式和举止动作”，对“天上的神仙，地下的动物”，对“甩水袖、梅花指”，也津津乐道，很感兴趣，苦心研究。
    周扬的思想、感情、趣味不能不说是“丰富多彩”，周扬的的确确是一个资产阶级、修正主义的“三丰富”的活标本！
    周扬搞的这一套“三丰富”，说穿了，就是妄图把社会主义的文艺舞台变成封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的黑色大染缸，用资产阶级的思想、资产阶级的感情、资产阶级的趣味来腐蚀人们的心灵，以达到他“和平演变”、复辟资本主义的目的。
    周扬不是叫嚷要“通情达理”吗？我们广大工农兵、革命干部和革命的知识分子，通的是无产阶级之情，达的是马列主义、毛泽东思想之理，对于资产阶级的思想、感情、趣味，我们只能毫不留情地厌恶它，批判它，抛弃它。毛主席教导我们要做“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”我们一定照毛主席的指示办事，彻底砸烂周扬“三丰富”的黑染缸，彻底清除一切资产阶级、修正主义渣滓。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在毛泽东思想大学校里，锻炼成为具有崇高的革命理想、深厚的无产阶级感情和高尚趣味的共产主义新人！
