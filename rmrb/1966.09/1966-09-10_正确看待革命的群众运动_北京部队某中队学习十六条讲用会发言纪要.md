The soldiers and officers of a certain platoon in the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army have, in the process of thoroughly studying the Sixteen Points, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line. They held a meeting to discuss how to correctly view the revolutionary mass movement and other related issues. Below are some of the speeches from the meeting.

Revolutionary Torrent Moves Forward

Comrade Zhou Yunqing, the squad leader, said: Currently, an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is surging forward with an irresistible momentum, sweeping away all the decaying thoughts and cultural strongholds of the exploiting classes. In this life-and-death class struggle, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have become the main force, forming an unstoppable torrent that washes away all the filth of the old society and sweeps away all the ghosts and monsters.

The revolutionary path is never smooth. In this great and magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will inevitably encounter various obstacles and may experience some twists and turns. Chairman Mao taught us in "Hunan Peasant Movement Survey Report" that once the revolutionary mass movement truly begins, "no matter what great force, they will not be able to suppress it. They will break through all the nets that bind them and rush forward on the path to liberation." We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, correctly understand the main trend of the revolutionary movement and its invincible power, and actively promote the development of the movement. At the same time, we must fully anticipate that some people with ulterior motives will seize on the trivial aspects of the mass movement to create "incidents," using them to attack the revolutionary leftists, confuse the broad masses, and attempt to fish in troubled waters and shift the focus. We must stay alert and guard against thieves. In this complex and intense class struggle, we must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward bravely!

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary mass movement is invincible. We, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, are the main force of the Cultural Revolution. Various twists and turns and obstacles will not stop our march forward. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works more effectively in the struggle, regard the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as our battle program, and better play the role of the main force. Let the surging revolutionary torrent sweep away all obstacles blocking the revolution's advance!

Break First, Establish Later

Soldier Zhang Yuanshun said: Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing more broadly and deeply. One after another, anti-party dens have been smashed, and batch after batch of ghosts and monsters have been exposed. Those who have infiltrated the party as representatives of the bourgeoisie have been removed from their positions, and the old bourgeois educational system is being thoroughly reformed. Emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties have been driven off the stage... Facing this stormy revolutionary mass movement, some people are afraid and say, "This way of doing things is too chaotic!" No matter who says this, it is an expression of fear of the masses and fear of the revolution, and it is a slander against the great revolutionary mass movement.

Chairman Mao said: "Revolution is not like inviting people to dinner, writing an essay, painting a picture, or embroidering flowers; it cannot be so gentle, so leisurely, so polite, so restrained, so yielding. Revolution is an uprising, a violent act of one class overthrowing another." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls, a life-and-death class struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's counter-restoration. In this struggle, all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits will be eliminated, and all anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought ghosts and monsters will be burned to death by the masses' revolutionary fire. This is how it is. The more thoroughly we break, the more thoroughly we can establish; the faster we break, the faster we can establish. This is the law of all revolutionary movements. For revolutionary people, this is a great thing, very good, and not at all "chaotic." Would continuing to give those ghosts and monsters the freedom to write black books, perform black plays, open black shops, and speak black words, the freedom to attack Mao Zedong Thought and restore capitalism, and the freedom to poison people with old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits be called "not chaotic"? If we really go on like this, our proletarian dictatorship state will truly be in chaos, and there will be the danger of national ruin, party ruin, and personal ruin.

Chairman Mao teaches us that without breaking, there can be no establishing; without blocking, there can be no flowing; without stopping, there can be no moving. Break first, and establish within. Regarding those anti-party gangsters and the positions they occupy, and regarding the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits that poison people, we must resolutely and thoroughly eliminate them. Only in this way can Mao Zedong Thought deeply take root in the hearts of seven hundred million people, the proletarian ideological stronghold be firmly consolidated, and new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits that adapt to the socialist system be greatly promoted.

Revolutionaries Must Support Revolutionary Changes

New soldier Li Shangmin said: As early as March 1927, in "Hunan Peasant Movement Survey Report," Chairman Mao, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, praised the then stormy peasant movement as "very good" and sternly refuted the various fallacies that slandered the peasant movement as "very bad." Chairman Mao said: "Tens of millions of slaves—peasants—are overturning their man-eating enemies there. The actions of the peasants are completely correct, and their actions are very good! 'Very good' is the theory of the peasants and other revolutionaries." "All revolutionary comrades must support this change; otherwise, they will stand on the counter-revolutionary position." This clearly tells us that the attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement contains deep class content. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses have smashed one "San Jia Village" after another and exposed one anti-party, anti-socialist gangster after another. Workers, peasants, and soldiers unanimously shout, "Very good!" But all reactionaries will surely harbor grudges against this good situation and will surely use various means to strike and obstruct the revolutionary movement of the broad masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If the enemy vigorously opposes us, defames us as utterly worthless, then it is even better; it proves that we not only draw a clear line with the enemy but also that our work is very successful." Isn't this the case? Has there ever been a day when the enemy does not oppose us, does not curse us? The 1927 Hunan peasant movement, which they slandered as "very bad," did not it make the local tyrants and evil gentry lose their prestige and ignite the revolutionary fire? In 1958, when our people carried out the party's general line of building socialism with great enthusiasm, great strides, good quality, and at a high speed, was it not similarly slandered as "very bad" by the anti-party right-opportunists? Our broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers launched a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and the anti-party gangsters viciously attacked us for "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism." In short, everything that is very good for the revolutionary cause is slandered by the class enemy as "very bad." If they say "good" from their mouths, then our revolutionary cause would be bad. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the Sixteen Points as a weapon, pursue and attack relentlessly, expose all ghosts and monsters, overthrow them, stomp on them with our feet, uproot the black line and black gangs that are anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and clean up all the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes.

Learn the Art of Struggle in the Struggle

Squad leader Han Fengzhong said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Learn warfare from warfare—this is our main method. Those who have no opportunity to go to school can still learn warfare, that is, learn from warfare. Revolutionary warfare is a matter for the masses, often not learning first and then doing, but doing and then learning. Doing is learning."

The history of our people's revolutionary struggle is a history of the masses liberating themselves and educating themselves. Take my hometown, Jiaozhuang Village in Shunyi County, Beijing, for example. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, our revolutionary forebears took up arms and fought against the evil enemy. At that time, there were few guns and poor equipment, but with the guidance of Chairman Mao's people's war thought, they learned the art of fighting against the enemy through their struggle against the enemy and, together with the people of Ji, created the famous underground warfare known worldwide. They fought over 150 battles, killing a large number of enemies and expanding the revolutionary forces.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also a great revolutionary movement in which the masses liberate themselves and educate themselves, a practical and vivid classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and undergoing the test of class struggle. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have raised their awareness, increased their abilities, distinguished right from wrong, and clarified the enemy from ourselves through this struggle; they have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. With Mao Zedong Thought as our guide and the Central Committee's Sixteen Points decision as our weapon, we will surely achieve a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    正确看待革命的群众运动
    ——北京部队某中队学习十六条讲用会发言纪要
    人民解放军北京部队某中队指战员，在深入学习十六条的过程中，反复学习了毛主席有关群众路线的论述，就有关如何正确看待革命的群众运动等问题，举行了一次讲用会。下面是讲用会上一部分战士的发言。
    革命洪流永向前
    班长周云青说：当前，一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，正以汹涌澎湃、不可阻挡的气势，冲击着剥削阶级残存的一切腐朽的思想和文化阵地。在这场你死我活的阶级大搏斗中，我们广大工农兵群众充当了革命的主力军，汇成一股锐不可当的洪流，涤荡着一切旧社会的污垢，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。
    革命的道路不可能是笔直的。在这场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，必然会遇到种种阻力，也难免会出现一些这样或那样的曲折。毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》一文里教导我们，革命的群众运动真正发动起来之后，“无论什么大的力量都将压抑不住。他们将冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑。”我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，正确认识革命运动的主流和它的战无不胜的无穷威力，积极促进运动的发展。同时，也必须充分估计到，一些别有用心的人，抓住群众运动的枝枝节节，大做“文章”，以此来攻击革命左派，迷惑广大群众，妄图混水摸鱼，转移视线。我们一定要提高警惕，谨防扒手。在复杂、激烈的阶级斗争中，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进！
    在毛泽东思想指导下的革命群众运动，是战无不胜的。我们广大工农兵是文化大革命的主力军，这样或那样的曲折和阻力，丝毫不能阻止我们前进的步伐。我们一定要更好地在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定当作战斗纲领，更好地发挥主力军的作用，让汹涌澎湃的革命洪流，把一切阻挡革命前进的障碍物冲个稀巴烂！
    破字当头，立在其中
    战士臧元勋说：目前无产阶级文化大革命正在更广阔更深入地向前发展。一个又一个的反党黑店被捣毁了，一批又一批的牛鬼蛇神被揪了出来。钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物被罢了官，旧的资产阶级教育制度正在彻底改革，帝王将相、才子佳人被赶下了舞台……。面对这场暴风骤雨般的革命群众运动，有些人害怕了，他们胡说什么：“这样搞法太乱了！”这种说法，不管出自什么人之口，都是害怕群众、害怕革命的表现，都是对伟大的革命群众运动的污蔑。
    毛主席说：“革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章，不是绘画绣花，不能那样雅致，那样从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样温良恭俭让。革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命，是一场资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的你死我活的阶级斗争。在这场斗争中，一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯都将被清除，一切反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的牛鬼蛇神，都将被群众的革命大火烧死。事情就是这样，我们破得越彻底，也就立得越彻底；破得越快，也就立得越快。这是一切革命运动的规律。对革命人民来说，这是天大的好事，好得很，根本不是什么“乱”。难道继续给那些牛鬼蛇神以写黑书、演黑戏、开黑店、讲黑话的自由，给他们以攻击毛泽东思想、复辟资本主义的自由，给旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯以毒害人们的自由，才叫“不乱”吗？如果真的这样下去，我们的无产阶级专政的国家就会真的大乱，就有亡国、亡党、亡头的危险。
    毛主席教导我们，不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。破字当头，立也就在其中了。对于那些反党黑帮分子以及他们所盘踞的阵地，对于毒害人们的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，我们一定要坚决、彻底破除掉。只有这样，毛泽东思想才能在七亿人民心中深深扎根，无产阶级思想阵地才能牢牢地巩固，适应社会主义制度的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯才能大大发扬。
    革命派就要拥护革命的变动
    新战士李尚敏说：毛主席早在一九二七年三月《湖南农民运动考察报告》中，就以最大的革命热情，歌颂当时暴风骤雨似的农民运动“好得很”，严正地批驳了污蔑农民运动为“糟得很”的种种谬论。毛主席说：“无数万成群的奴隶——农民，在那里打翻他们的吃人的仇敌。农民的举动，完全是对的，他们的举动好得很！‘好得很’是农民及其他革命派的理论。”“一切革命同志都要拥护这个变动，否则他就站到反革命立场上去了。”这就明确地告诉我们，对待革命群众运动的态度包含着深刻的阶级内容。在当前无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命群众捣毁了一个个“三家村”，揪出了一个个反党反社会主义黑帮分子。工农兵齐声欢呼“好得很”！但是一切反动分子对这种大好形势必然怀恨在心，必然会采取各种手段，打击、阻挠广大群众的革命运动。
    毛主席教导我们：“如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”事实不正是这样吗，敌人有那一天不反对我们、不大骂我们呢？被他们攻击为“糟得很”的一九二七年湖南农民运动，不是把土豪劣绅打得威风扫地，点燃了革命烈火吗！一九五八年当我国人民贯彻执行党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，出现了轰轰烈烈的大跃进的时候，不是同样被反党的右倾机会主义分子污蔑为“糟得很”吗？我们全国广大工农兵掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，反党黑帮们就恶毒地攻击我们“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“实用主义”。一句话，凡是对革命事业好得很的一切东西，都被阶级敌人污蔑为“糟得很”。如果从他们嘴里说一声“好”，那我们的革命事业就糟了。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以十六条为武器，穷追猛打，把所有牛鬼蛇神统统揪出来，打翻在地，踏上一只脚，把反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的黑线、黑帮连根拔掉，把一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯扫除干净。
    在斗争中学习斗争的本领
    班长韩凤忠说：毛主席教导我们：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。没有进学校机会的人，仍然可以学习战争，就是从战争中学习。革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”
    我国人民革命斗争的历史，就是群众自己解放自己、群众自己教育自己的历史。就拿我的家乡——北京市顺义县焦庄户村来说吧，在抗日战争、解放战争时期，我们村的革命前辈们拿起枪杆子，同万恶的敌人斗。那时枪少装备差，但是有了毛主席的人民战争思想的指引，他们通过对敌斗争学会了对敌斗争的本领，和冀中人民一起创造了闻名中外的地道战，先后作战一百五十多次，大量杀伤了敌人，发展壮大了革命力量。
    无产阶级文化大革命，也是一个群众自己解放自己、自己教育自己的伟大革命运动，是一个活学活用毛泽东思想、经受阶级斗争风浪考验的最实际、最生动的活课堂。广大工农兵群众从这场斗争中提高了觉悟，增长了才干，辨别了是非，分清了敌我；对于毛主席的阶级、阶级斗争的教导，有了更深刻的理解。我们有毛泽东思想作指针，有党中央的十六条决定作武器，我们一定能够取得文化大革命的彻底胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。　（新华社九日讯）
