	Face-to-Face and Heart-to-Hear
	Li Yanxing, Party Branch Secretary of Daling Brigade, Luodong Commune, Fengkai County, Guangdong Province

	I have been the branch secretary for seven years. For a long time, I made all the decisions myself, detached from the masses. The masses saw me but didn't speak from the heart; it was truly a case of seeing faces but not hearts.

	At that time, I always thought I had experience and could see problems clearly, so I didn't need to consult with others. I thought: in the party branch, I am the "leader," and everyone should listen to me. Even if the higher-ups' words don't make sense, they still have to be executed. One winter, the commune called for each brigade to tap into the land's potential and increase grain production. I thought: there are over thirty mu of fields by the river covered by sand and stones. If we reclaim them to plant rice, even if each mu yields three hundred catties of grain, one harvest would yield over ten thousand catties. Without consulting the cadres, let alone listening to the masses, I ordered the commune members to move the sand. The masses had many objections, saying: "The brigade still has over four hundred mu of fields that haven't gone through the waterworks, but now we're moving sand instead of repairing the waterworks. Isn't this like dropping a watermelon to pick up a date?" Everyone's thoughts were not united, and those who went to carry sand were lazy and scattered, with fewer and fewer people. In the end, the sand wasn't moved, and it also affected the repair of the waterworks. It was truly a case of cutting the melon and both ends being empty.

	This incident made me deeply realize that if cadres do not respect the masses, do not trust the masses, and adopt an attitude of "I am the greatest," then there is no question of democratic style. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must not be self-righteous, arrogant, thinking that they are good at everything and others are good at nothing; they must not lock themselves in a small room, boasting and acting like a king." Following this teaching, I often pay attention to fighting against the tendencies of self-righteousness and arrogance, putting down my airs, humbly being a student, and always paying attention to placing myself in the right position with the masses.

	The saying goes, "To forge iron, one must first be strong." To implement democratic centralism, the "leader" must first set an example, often carrying out criticism and self-criticism. If one lacks the spirit of serious self-criticism, one cannot see one's own shortcomings and cannot accept others' opinions. If one's conduct is not upright, one's words will not be effective. One speaks Marxism-Leninism to others but liberalism to oneself; even if one's words are loud, no one will listen. In recent years, I have always remembered Chairman Mao's words, gradually cultivating the habit of self-criticism, and actively making self-examinations to the cadres and masses when I have shortcomings.

	Last autumn, before the harvest, a nursery was set up in the Daling area. The branch assigned the women's director, Li Guiying, to take charge of this work. Just after the Spring Festival, Li Guiying reported to me: the parents think the fee for children entering the nursery is too high, and no one wants to send their children. I heard this and got very angry, thinking: soon it will be the busy spring planting season, and if the nursery is not run well, it will affect production. I didn't ask questions, but firmly said she had a problem with her thinking. She felt wronged, and I was not at ease. That night, I opened and carefully read the article "On Rectifying Wrong Ideas in the Party." Chairman Mao said: "Party criticism must prevent subjectivism and vulgarization, and words must have evidence; criticism must pay attention to politics." This truly awakened me from my dream, making me realize that my criticism of Li Guiying was somewhat impulsive, which is not the attitude towards comrades. The next morning, I went to Li Guiying's house and sincerely apologized to her, discussing together how to run the nursery well.

	The branch secretary took the lead, and the other cadres followed suit. The ninth production team leader, who previously had poor democratic style, adopted a discriminatory attitude towards the old poor peasant Li Zhenhui, who often raised objections. Later, after he went to Li Zhenhui's house to apologize, Li Zhenhui's anger subsided, and he became more concerned about the collective than before, leading a few commune members to engage in short-term sideline production, increasing income for the team.

	Without extensive democracy, there will be no genuine centralism. If cadres want to hear the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they must mutually understand and sincerely communicate with them, becoming close friends. Looking back, when I was not a cadre, I was very close with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and we all spoke from the heart; but after becoming the branch secretary, everyone was polite to me. Why? Mainly because after becoming a cadre, I participated less in collective production labor, and the poor and lower-middle peasants saw me as an official. Although we often saw each other, we did not see each other's hearts. Not hearing their heartfelt words, it is impossible to concentrate everyone's wisdom, and of course, one will suffer more from bureaucratism and commandism. Finding the root of the problem, I treated it accordingly. The branch committee made a resolution for the committee members to go to the production teams to stay and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants in "three-together" activities, requiring each party member to make three to five close friends. I took the lead in implementing this resolution, and indeed, the relationship with the masses became closer, and everyone was willing to talk to me about their opinions, achieving face-to-face and heart-to-heart communication.

	Postscript
	Chairman Mao teaches us that we must first be the students of the masses and then their teachers. This means that cadres must often go among the masses, humbly listening to the masses' opinions.

	Cadres must often see the faces of the masses and even more, see their hearts. This means that the masses should be able to speak their true feelings to the cadres, and the cadres should be able to hear the true feelings of the masses.

	To be able to hear the true feelings of the masses, one must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and honestly admit: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and laughable." Only in this way can cadres truly put down their airs, humbly be students, and humbly consult with the masses on all matters, walking the mass line in all work.

	The experience of Li Yanxing, the branch secretary of Daling Brigade, once again proves this to be a truth.

    见面又见心
    广东省封开县罗董公社大垌大队党支部书记　黎炎兴
    我当支部书记七年了。在好长时间里，什么事都是我个人说了算，脱离群众。群众见了我，不说心里话，真是见面不见心。
    那时候，我总认为自己工作有经验，问题看得准，不需要同别人商量。我这样想：在党支部里，我是“班长”，大家要听我的。上级的话，思想通不通也得执行。有一年的冬天，公社号召各大队挖掘土地潜力，增产粮食。我想：河边有三十多亩田被沙石掩盖，复垦出来种水稻，每亩即使收三百斤谷，一造就有上万斤，我没有和干部商量，更没有听取群众的意见，就叫社员去搬沙。群众意见纷纷，说：“队里还有四百多亩田没有过水利关，现在不去修水利而去挑沙，这不是丢了西瓜拣芝麻么！”大家思想不统一，去担沙的群众懒懒散散，人数越来越少。结果，沙没有搬完，又影响了修水利，真是刀切通菜两头空。
    这件事使我深深体会到，干部如果不尊重群众，不相信群众，抱着“老子天下第一”的态度，就根本谈不上什么民主作风。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员决不可自以为是，盛气凌人，以为自己是什么都好，别人是什么都不好；决不可把自己关在小房子里，自吹自擂，称王称霸。”按照这个教导，我经常注意同自以为是、盛气凌人的思想作风作斗争，放下臭架子，甘当小学生，处处注意摆正自己和群众的位置。
    俗话讲，打铁先得本身硬。贯彻执行民主集中制，当“班长”的首先要起模范作用，经常开展批评和自我批评。如果缺少认真的自我批评精神，看不见自己的缺点，便装不进别人的意见。其身不正，其言不灵。对他人马列主义，对自己自由主义，话说得雷声响也无人听。近年来，我紧记毛主席的话，逐步养成了自我批评的习惯，有了缺点，主动向干部和群众作检讨。
    去年秋收前大垌片办了托儿所，支部派妇女主任李桂英负责抓这项工作。刚过春节，李桂英向我反映：家长们嫌小孩入托的收费过高，都不愿送小孩。我一听好火滚，心想：转眼春耕大忙，托儿所办不好会影响生产。我便不问三七二十一，硬说她思想有问题。她感到委屈，我心里也不安乐。晚上，我打开《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇文章细细阅读。毛主席说：“党内批评要防止主观武断和把批评庸俗化，说话要有证据，批评要注意政治。”这真是一言惊醒梦中人，使我认识到自己对李桂英的批评有些意气用事，这不是对待同志的态度。隔天一早，我就到李桂英家里诚恳地向她检讨，共同商量怎样把托儿所办好。
    支部书记带头迈了步，其他干部也照着去做。第九生产队队长，过去民主作风差，对爱提意见的老贫农黎湛辉采取歧视的态度。后来他登门向湛辉道歉后，湛辉的气消了，比以前更关心集体了，带领几个社员搞短期副业生产，为队里增加了收入。
    没有广泛的民主，就不会有真正的集中。干部想要听到贫下中农的心里话，就要和他们互相了解，赤诚相见，做知心朋友。回想我没有当干部的时候，和贫下中农兄弟亲亲热热，彼此都说内心话；可是当上支部书记后，大家对我客客气气了。为什么？主要是自己当干部后参加集体生产劳动少了，贫下中农兄弟把我看成了官老爷，虽然和他们经常见面，但彼此见面不见心。听不到他们的心底话，就无法集中大家的智慧，吃官僚主义、命令主义的苦头当然就多了。找到了病根，就对症下药。支委会作出了支委分头下生产队蹲点，和贫下中农兄弟“三同”的决议，要求每个党员交三个到五个知心朋友。我带头执行了这个决议，果然同群众的关系越来越密切，大家有意见也愿意向我谈了，做到了见面又见心。
    编后
    毛主席教导我们，要先当群众的学生，后当群众的先生。这就是要干部经常深入到群众中去，虚心地听取群众的意见。
    干部要经常见到群众的面，更要见到群众的心。这就是说，要群众能向干部说出真心话，干部能听到群众的真心话。
    要能听到群众的真心话，就要按照毛主席的指示办事，老老实实地承认：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。只有这样，干部才有可能真正放下臭架子，甘当小学生，遇事虚心地同群众商量，在一切工作中都走群众路线。
    大垌大队党支部书记黎炎兴的体会，再次证明这是一个真理。
