    The pre-shrinking of fabrics can be achieved through two methods. One is resin finishing, and the other is mechanical pre-shrinking. The latter method has a lower production cost and is widely used in various countries.

    Pre-shrinking machines are patented products in the capitalist world.

    Foreign pre-shrinking machines are generally equipped with a full set of machinery, and their import prices are very high.

    The workers of Shanghai's Second Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory have worked diligently to create their own pre-shrinking machine. The structure is simple, the cost is only one-thirtieth of the imported equipment, and it is also very convenient to operate. The shrinkage rate of the processed fabric can be reduced to within one percent, achieving the same effect as foreign equipment.

    预缩机
    织物的防缩处理，有两种方法。一种是用树脂整理，一种是用机械预缩。后一种方法，生产成本比较低，各国已普遍使用。
    预缩机械，在资本主义世界是一项专利品。
    国外的预缩机械，一般都配备一大套机器，进口价格很贵。
    上海第二印染厂的职工奋发图强，制造出了自己的预缩机，结构简单，造价只及进口设备的三十分之一，操作也很方便。经过处理的织物，缩水率同样可以下降到百分之一以内，达到了洋设备的同样效果。
