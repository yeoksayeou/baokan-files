	Meldourne news: The deputy chairman of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), Malon, recently issued a statement calling on the people to grasp Mao Zedong Thought.

	In his statement published in the 34th issue of "Pioneer," Malon pointed out, "In the contemporary world, Mao Zedong's thought and cause are the core of Marxism-Leninism, just as Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin held the central position in their respective eras. There is no doubt that Mao Zedong's cause is the direct continuation of the cause of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. It is precisely because the enemies of the workers, especially American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, hate him so deeply that he is loved and respected by the common people of the world. His judgments are increasingly being proven by a series of events; these judgments guide the people to understand these events and to struggle around these events."

	The statement also said, "In Australia, our position on the issues in the international communist movement has been proven correct. We condemn Khrushchev's revisionism and its echoers in Australia."

	The statement emphasized, "We believe that we must strive to enable the masses to grasp Marxism-Leninism, including Mao Zedong Thought."

    澳共（马列主义者）副主席马隆发表声明
    必须使人民群众掌握毛泽东思想
    新华社十二日讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）副主席马隆最近发表声明，号召人民群众掌握毛泽东思想。
    马隆在第三十四期《先锋报》刊登的声明中指出，“在当代，毛泽东的思想和事业是马克思列宁主义的核心，就像马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林在他们的时代占着中心地位一样。毫无疑问，毛泽东的事业是马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的事业的直接延续。正是因为工人的敌人、特别是美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者对他恨之入骨，所以他受到全世界普通人民的爱戴和尊敬。他的论断越来越被一系列事件所证实；这些论断指引人民去了解这些事件和围绕这些事件去进行斗争。”
    声明还说，“在澳大利亚，我们在国际共产主义运动中的问题上所采取的立场，已经证明是正确的，我们谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义及其在澳大利亚的应声虫。”
    声明强调说，“我们认为：必须加紧为使群众掌握包括毛泽东思想在内的马克思列宁主义而奋斗。”
