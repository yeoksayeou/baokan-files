When life becomes unbearable, one must rise up to resist and struggle. Twenty million government employees in West Bengal, India, went on strike and demonstrated. More than sixty thousand teachers in Calcutta continued their strike, and two thousand students went on an indefinite hunger strike.

New Delhi, September 15 (Xinhua) — A report from New Delhi says that more than twenty million low-level government employees in West Bengal, India, went on strike and demonstrated on September 13, demanding an increase in wages.

According to reports, this large-scale strike brought the operations of the West Bengal government and some county governments to a complete halt. The *Indian Express* reported from Calcutta: "Government offices were desolate. Police guarded the important offices of the state and federal governments."

The strikers held a demonstration that day, protesting the government's refusal to increase the cost-of-living allowance and other subsidies.

In Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal, more than sixty thousand teachers who began their strike on September 10 continued their protest. On September 13, they sent five thousand representatives to the governor's residence to hold a sit-in demonstration.

Approximately two thousand students from the Bengal Engineering College in Calcutta began an indefinite hunger strike on September 13, protesting the police's suppression of students.

New Delhi, September 13 (Xinhua) — Under the reactionary rule of the Indian government, the economy is deteriorating, and recently, large numbers of teachers, employees, and newspaper staff have taken to the streets in anti-hunger and pro-survival demonstrations.

According to reports, in India's largest city, Calcutta, more than ten million specialized school and middle school teachers, government employees, and private enterprise employees held a large demonstration on September 9, demanding an increase in wages and a halt to price increases. The demonstrators held a rally, strongly protesting the Indian government's indifference to their impoverished situation.

More than sixty thousand teachers in West Bengal began an indefinite strike on September 10, demanding the issuance of cost-of-living allowances and the establishment of a reasonable minimum wage. This strike affected 4,800 schools.

More than one thousand employees of *The Hindustan Times*, one of India's largest newspapers, held a demonstration in New Delhi on September 10, demanding an increase in cost-of-living subsidies and relief funds. This newspaper has been suspended for three days starting from September 11. Approximately three hundred employees of *The Leader* and *The Indian Express* also began a strike on September 12, demanding improved living conditions.
