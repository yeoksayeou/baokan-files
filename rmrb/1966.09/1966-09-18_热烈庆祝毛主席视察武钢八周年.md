Two hundred thousand revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel Company held a grand rally to celebrate the eighth anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of Wuhan Steel. Over the past eight years, Wuhan Steel has followed the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and achieved victory after victory in the three great revolutionary movements. The broad masses of workers are determined to seize the revolution and promote production, to achieve double victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production construction, and to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, turning Wuhan Steel into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, September 17th: Today, September 13th, is the eighth anniversary of the day our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao inspected Wuhan Steel. On the afternoon of the 13th, two hundred thousand revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel Company held a grand celebration meeting, vowing to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, to manage enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, and to turn Wuhan Steel into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

September 13, 1958, was the most glorious and happiest day in the history of Wuhan Steel. On this day, our great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected Wuhan Steel and gave extremely important instructions to all the workers of Wuhan Steel. Chairman Mao said: "Large-scale enterprises like Wuhan Steel can gradually be developed into comprehensive combined enterprises. In addition to producing various steel products, they should also engage in some mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and construction engineering, etc. ... Such large-scale enterprises, in addition to industry, should also have some agriculture, commerce, education, and military."

Chairman Mao's warm care and great instructions have brought boundless strength to all the workers of Wuhan Steel and pointed out the direction for their advancement. Over the past eight years, the broad revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals of Wuhan Steel have overcome one difficulty after another, forged ahead bravely under the guidance of Chairman Mao, and achieved one victory after another in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. Mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and construction engineering have developed significantly since 1958. The revolutionary workers of the Mechanical General Factory responded to Chairman Mao's call, launched a great technological innovation and technological revolution, relied on their own strength, and strove for self-improvement. Originally, they could only produce spare parts, but now they can produce complete sets of mechanical equipment. Some equipment that previously relied on imports and support from sister provinces and cities can now be produced independently. In the chemical industry, the coke production of the coking plant has increased by four times compared to 1958, the fertilizer production has increased by seven times, and the variety of coking chemical products has increased by nearly five times. In the construction industry, the company has established a special engineering company and construction department to undertake the major and medium repairs of blast furnaces and to dispatch technical forces to support sister units. At the same time, the revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel, following Chairman Mao's instructions on universal military training, have established a militia division. Ninety percent of the workers in the entire company have joined the militia organization. They hold a hammer in one hand and a gun in the other, study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, practice military skills, and are ready at any time to annihilate all invading enemies. Wuhan Steel's workers' spare-time education and half-work-half-study schools have also achieved certain results. Currently, there is one half-work-half-study school, one spare-time university, one medical college, and a large number of secondary spare-time technical schools. Ordinary secondary schools are developing towards the half-work-half-study direction. Recently, the company has established a special agricultural office and is actively developing agriculture.

To hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly, comprehensively, and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's great instructions, to always remember Chairman Mao's great instructions, and to turn Wuhan Steel into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, Wuhan Steel, based on the initiative of the broad revolutionary workers, has decided to make September 13th of each year the memorial day of Wuhan Steel.

The grand celebration meeting held on the 13th to commemorate the eighth anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of Wuhan Steel was held under the situation where both the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production construction have seen new high tides. Since May this year, the broad revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel have seen a new high tide in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The workers have taken the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all their work and as the action guide for carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have launched a fierce attack on the capitalist-roaders in power, the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and all the ghosts and monsters that are anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticizing the "four olds" and establishing the "four news," promoting the further proletarianization, revolutionization, and combatization of the worker ranks, and achieving a new leap in production. The workers have displayed the daring, daring to do, revolutionary, and rebellious spirit of the proletariat, breaking old rules and regulations, resolutely taking the road of developing industry independently in our country, and achieving tremendous successes. On the eve of September 13th, the broad revolutionary workers of Wuhan Steel launched a new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works, reviewing Chairman Mao's important instructions to the workers of Wuhan Steel on September 13, 1958. On the high buildings in the Wuhan Steel plant area, Chairman Mao's great instructions are written in large characters. All the workers in the company are determined to seize the revolution and promote production, to achieve double victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production construction with actual actions, to celebrate this great memorial day. The workers said: Our great leader Chairman Mao personally inspected the first batch of iron water we produced in the blast furnace. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and greatest encouragement for us, and our greatest honor. Whenever we think of September 13, 1958, and our great leader Chairman Mao, we are full of energy. We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and turn Wuhan Steel into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    武汉钢铁公司革命职工两万多人隆重集会
    热烈庆祝毛主席视察武钢八周年
    八年来，武钢沿着毛主席指引的方向，在三大革命运动中取得一个又一个的胜利。广大职工决心抓革命促生产，夺取文化大革命和生产建设双胜利，决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把武钢办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    新华社武汉十七日电今年九月十三日，是我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席视察武钢八周年。武汉钢铁公司革命职工两万多人在十三日下午隆重举行庆祝大会，表示一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，按照毛泽东思想办企业，把武钢办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    一九五八年九月十三日，是武钢历史上最光荣、最幸福的一天。这一天，我们伟大的领袖毛主席，亲临武钢视察，对武钢全体职工作了极其重要的指示。毛主席说：“像武钢这样的大型企业，可以逐步地办成综合性的联合企业，除生产多种钢铁产品外，还要办点机械工业、化学工业和建筑工业等。……这样的大型企业，除工业外，农、商、学、兵都要有一点。”
    毛主席的亲切关怀和伟大指示，给武钢全体职工带来了无穷的力量，指明了前进的方向。八年来，武钢广大革命工人、革命干部、革命知识分子，排除了一个又一个的困难，沿着毛主席指引的方向奋勇前进，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的实践中，取得了一个又一个胜利。机械工业、化学工业和建筑工业自一九五八年以来，有了较大的发展。机械总厂的革命职工响应毛主席的号召，大闹技术革新、技术革命，自力更生，奋发图强，原来只能制造备品备件，现在已经能制造成套的机械设备了。一些过去靠进口和靠兄弟省市支援的设备，现在也可以自己制造了。化学工业方面，焦化厂目前的焦炭产量比一九五八年增长了四倍，化肥产量增长了七倍，炼焦化工产品的品种增长了将近五倍。建筑工业方面，公司专门成立了工程公司和修建部，担负着高炉的大中修任务，并且抽出技术力量支援兄弟单位。与此同时，武钢革命职工遵照毛主席关于全民皆兵的指示，大办民兵师，全公司有百分之九十的职工参加了民兵组织。他们一手拿锤，一手拿枪，活学活用毛主席著作，苦练杀敌本领，随时准备消灭一切胆敢来犯的敌人。武钢的职工业余教育和半工半读学校，也取得了一定的成绩。现在有一所半工半读学校，一所业余大学，一所医专和大批中等业余技术学校，普通中等学校正在向半工半读方向发展。最近公司专门成立了农业办公室，正积极兴办农业。
    为了更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真地、全面地、彻底地、不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的伟大指示，永远牢记毛主席的伟大指示，把武钢办成毛泽东思想大学校，武钢根据广大革命职工的倡议，已经决定将每年的九月十三日作为武钢的纪念日。
    十三日隆重举行的庆祝毛主席视察武钢八周年纪念大会，是在无产阶级文化大革命和生产建设都出现新的高潮的形势下举行的。今年五月以来，武钢广大革命职工活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新的高潮，职工们以战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导方针，作为进行无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南，向走资本主义道路的当权派，向资产阶级反动“权威”，向一切反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的牛鬼蛇神猛烈开火，大破“四旧”，大立“四新”，促进了职工队伍的进一步无产阶级化、革命化和战斗化，生产出现了新的跃进局面。职工们发扬了敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的无产阶级革命精神，大破陈规旧律，坚决走我国自己发展工业的道路，取得了十分巨大的成就。在九月十三日前夕，武钢广大革命职工又掀起了学习毛主席著作的新高潮，重温了毛主席一九五八年九月十三日对武钢职工的重要指示。在武钢厂区高大的建筑物上，都用大字写上了毛主席的这一伟大指示。全公司职工决心抓革命，促生产，以夺取文化大革命和生产建设双胜利的实际行动，来庆祝这一伟大的纪念日。工人们说：我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自观看了我们高炉炼出的第一炉铁水，这是毛主席对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，是我们最大的光荣。我们一想到一九五八年九月十三日，想到伟大的领袖毛主席，我们就浑身是劲。我们一定要按照毛主席的指示办事，把武钢办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
