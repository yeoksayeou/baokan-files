The China Africa Friendship Association held a reception to celebrate the national day of the Republic of Mali.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, Mali's Ambassador to China, Gise Tidiaine, said at the reception held by the China Africa Friendship Association today: "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great achievements made by the Chinese people in economic construction are a challenge to imperialism and reactionaries in various countries. The victory of the Chinese people is also our victory."

The ambassador also said, "At a time when imperialism is intensifying its subversion and interference in Africa, the Chinese government has provided comprehensive assistance to the people of our country and the people of various African countries, which is very precious."

He also praised the work of Chinese experts who helped Mali in economic construction.

Today's reception was held by the China Africa Friendship Association to celebrate the national day of the Republic of Mali. Vice Chairman of the China Africa Friendship Association, Nan Hanchen, spoke first at the reception. He congratulated the Malian people on their achievements in anti-imperialism and national construction, and wished for the further development of friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and Mali.

Nan Hanchen said, "Chairman Mao pointed out that the enemy will not disappear by itself, and imperialism and reactionaries in various countries will not voluntarily retire from the historical stage. Therefore, the people of Asia and Africa must resolutely carry out the struggle against imperialism, especially against American imperialism, to the end, to eliminate the influence of imperialism in all aspects of economy, politics, military, and culture, and to achieve complete political and economic independence."

Relevant officials and Chinese experts who had previously gone to Mali to help the Malian people build their country attended the reception.

    中非友协举行酒会庆祝马里共和国国庆
    据新华社二十一日讯  马里驻中国大使吉塞·提迪亚尼今天在中非友协举行的酒会上说：“中国人民在毛泽东思想的指引下，在经济建设中取得的伟大成就，是对帝国主义和各国反动派的一个挑战。中国人民的胜利也就是我们的胜利。”
    大使还说：“在帝国主义对非洲强化颠覆和干涉的时候，中国政府给了我国人民和非洲各国人民以全面的援助，这是十分可贵的。”
    他在讲话中还赞扬了帮助马里进行经济建设的中国专家的工作。
    今天的酒会是中国非洲人民友好协会为庆祝马里共和国国庆而举行的。中非友协副会长南汉宸在酒会上首先讲话，他祝贺马里人民在反帝和国家建设方面取得的成就，并祝愿中马两国人民的友好合作关系日益发展。
    南汉宸说，毛主席指出，敌人是不会自行消灭的，帝国主义和各国反动派是不会自动退出历史舞台的。因此，亚非人民必须坚决把反对帝国主义，特别是把反对美帝国主义的斗争进行到底，肃清帝国主义在经济、政治、军事、文化等一切方面的势力，实现完全的政治独立和经济独立。
    有关方面的负责人和曾经前往马里帮助马里人民建设的中国专家，出席了酒会。
