Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army's various arms and services, with rifles on their backs, one hand holding Chairman Mao's works, and the other holding sickles and hammers, vividly display the PLA's implementation of Chairman Mao's instructions. They transform the troops into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought and practice military training, agriculture, industry, and support for the people. This new image is presented to the audience through passionate revolutionary dances and songs.

    解放军各军种兵种的战士，身背钢枪，一手拿毛主席著作，一手拿镰刀、锤子，以充满革命激情的舞蹈和歌唱，把解放军贯彻毛主席的指示，使部队成为毛泽东思想的大学校，和实行军学、军农、军工、军民的新面貌生动形象地展现在观众眼前。
