	With the Hand Shaken by Chairman Mao, Reading Chairman Mao's Works Every Day
	Guizhou Agricultural College Red Guards, Chen Baohong

	September 15th is a day I will never forget. I saw our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, on Tiananmen Square! On this day, I became the happiest person in the world. My heart was filled with immense excitement, and I had a thousand words and a thousand books to express my feelings, but they were still not enough!

	The meeting began. Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, walked to the front of the stage and waved to the revolutionary students and teachers in the square. My eyes never left Chairman Mao, and my heart was never calm. When it was my turn to speak, the Chairman Mao whom I had longed for day and night stood before me. He shook my hand! I tightly grasped Chairman Mao's warm hand, looking at his benevolent smile, my heart surged like the waves of the sea. I was so excited that I couldn't say a word, and tears streamed down my face. I had so much to say to Chairman Mao! My family suffered in the old society, generation after generation. My father started working for the landlord at the age of twelve, suffering exploitation and oppression, enduring immense hardships. Before liberation, my elder brothers and sisters were born but could not be raised and all died, leaving only me, a single child. At the age of three, I fell ill and almost died. The Party and Chairman Mao liberated my family. From a naive little girl, I grew up to be an honorable member of the Communist Youth League and a university student of the people. Chairman Mao's books taught me the principles of revolution. Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could I have my today! Thinking of these things, how could I suppress my inner excitement? I was so excited that I cried and couldn't speak.

	At this moment, our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, came over and patted my shoulder, saying, "Don't be excited, don't be excited, take your time." Standing next to Chairman Mao, I felt immense happiness. Tears blurred my vision, and I couldn't see the words on my speech. I spoke while crying. After my speech, I tightly grasped Chairman Mao's hand again. What an extraordinary hand! It is this hand that liberated billions of suffering poor people, and it is this hand that guided the Chinese revolution from one victory to another! Today, Chairman Mao shook my hand. I will use the hand that shook Chairman Mao's to read Chairman Mao's books every day. I am determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao, and march forward bravely forever until communism!

	After the meeting, our great leader, Chairman Mao, and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, took a photo with us. We, the youth growing up in the era of Mao Zedong, are truly blessed.

	Revolutionary comrades from all over the country heard that I shook hands with Chairman Mao and surrounded me, eagerly shaking my hand. They asked me my name, and I said, "Chen Baohong." I will defend the Party Central Committee, defend Chairman Mao, defend the red flag shed with the blood of revolutionary martyrs, defend the iron mountain of socialism, maintain the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and uphold the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Red Army.

	When I returned to my dormitory, it was very late. My classmates saw me and surrounded me, eagerly shaking my hand. Everyone was excited, asking me to describe in detail the scene of seeing Chairman Mao on Tiananmen. They said, "How happy! How happy!" Until late at night, we still couldn't sleep. My heart was filled with excitement, joy, and shame. I made a resolution: I will study Chairman Mao's works even harder, honestly and seriously follow Chairman Mao's instructions, carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end! I will dedicate my life, even my life, to the cause of liberating all mankind, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, forever be Chairman Mao's little red soldier!

    用毛主席握过的手  天天捧读毛主席著作
    贵州农学院红卫兵　陈保红
    九月十五日，是我终身难忘的日子。我在天安门城楼上见到了最敬爱的领袖毛主席！这一天，我成为世界上最幸福的人。我万分激动的心情，千言万语说不尽，千本书写不完！
    大会开始了。我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，走到了大会主席台前，向广场上的革命师生招手致意。我的眼睛一直没有离开毛主席，我的心情一刻也没有平静过。到我发言了，日夜想念的毛主席就站在我的面前，他老人家和我握手了！我紧紧地握住毛主席温暖的大手，望着毛主席慈祥的笑脸，我的心像大海的波涛一样，滚滚翻腾。由于心情实在太激动，一句话也说不出来，热泪止不住地往外流。我有很多话要向毛主席说啊！我家在吃人的旧社会里，祖祖辈辈受苦受穷。父亲从十二岁起就给地主干活，受地主剥削和压迫，吃尽了苦头。解放前生下的哥哥姐姐，因无法养活都死掉了，只剩下我一个独苗苗，三岁时因得病，也几乎死了。党和毛主席解放了我的一家，我从一个不懂事的黄毛丫头，成长为一个光荣的共青团员、一个人民的大学生。毛主席的书，使我懂得了革命道理。要是没有共产党和毛主席，那还有我的今天！想到这些，又怎能抑制住我内心的激动，我激动得哭了，话也说不下去了。
    就在这时候，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席走过来，拍着我的肩膀说：“不要激动，不要激动，慢慢讲。”我站在毛主席身边，感到万分的幸福。泪水遮住了我的视线，发言稿上的字也看不清了。我一边流着热泪，一边发言。我发完言，又紧紧握住毛主席的手。这是一双多么不平凡的手啊！是这双大手，解放了亿万受苦难的穷苦人民，是这双大手，指引着中国革命从一个胜利走向一个胜利！今天，毛主席和我握手了，我要用和毛主席握过的手，天天捧着毛主席的书来读，我决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，跟着毛主席永远奋勇前进，直到共产主义！
    散会后，伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，同我们一起照了像。我们生长在毛泽东时代的青年，真是太幸福了。
    来自各地的革命战友，听说我和毛主席握过手，都围着我，抢着和我握手。他们问我叫什么名字，我说叫陈保红。我要保卫党中央，保卫毛主席，保卫革命先烈用鲜血换来的红旗，保卫社会主义铁打的江山，保持无产阶级的革命本色，保持红军的光荣革命传统。
    回到住地，已很晚了。同学们看见我回来了，都围着我，争着和我握手。同学们，个个心情激动，叫我详细讲述在天安门上见到毛主席的情景。他们说：“太幸福了！太幸福了！”直到深夜，我们还没有睡。我心里激动，高兴，惭愧。我下了决心：一定更加倍地努力学习毛主席著作，老老实实认认真真地按毛主席的指示办事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！把自己的毕生精力，以至生命，献给全人类的解放事业，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于党，忠于人民，永远做毛主席的红色小兵！
