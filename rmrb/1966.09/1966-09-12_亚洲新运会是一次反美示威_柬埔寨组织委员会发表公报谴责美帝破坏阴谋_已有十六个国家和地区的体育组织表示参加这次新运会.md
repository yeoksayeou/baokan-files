Sixteen Countries and Regions' Sports Organizations Have Expressed Their Participation in the New Asian Games

New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, September 11

According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on September 10, the Cambodian National Organizing Committee for the First New Asian Games issued a statement emphasizing the significant political implications of this sports event and strongly condemning the sabotage plots of American imperialists and their lackeys against the games.

The statement said, "Currently, American imperialism is shifting its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to Asia. It is intensifying its aggression against Asia, attempting to impose a war of aggression on the peoples of Asian countries, and continue or re-subjugate the Asian peoples in various ways.

"It can be predicted that, under these circumstances, the First New Asian Games will undoubtedly demonstrate the common will of the peoples of Asian countries to unite against American imperialism and will become a demonstration against American imperialism."

The statement pointed out that since the First New Asian Games began, the rapid development of sports in Asia and the continuous mutual visits between countries, especially the upcoming First New Asian Games, all strongly indicate that the peoples of the emerging forces in Asia have achieved many victories in their struggle against imperialist monopolies and manipulation of international sports.

The statement emphasized, "In the face of the revolutionary high tide of the peoples of the world, especially the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, imperialism and colonialism are now in a state of collapse. As the pillar of reactionary forces, American imperialism has suffered heavy defeats and has been shamefully defeated on the battlefields of South Vietnam. Imperialism, in order to prolong its precarious existence and to avoid its doom, is making desperate struggles and is resorting to any conspiracy and trickery to sabotage the common cause of the peoples of various countries in their struggle against imperialism.

"The American imperialists and their lackeys have issued threats against the peoples of the emerging forces in Asia, plotting conspiracies to disrupt the unity of the peoples of Asian countries and to sabotage the First New Asian Games. However, we have every reason to believe that the awakened peoples of the emerging forces in Asia, with their shared destiny, will unite and strengthen cooperation, encourage and support each other, and thoroughly smash the various conspiracies of the American imperialists and their lackeys, successfully holding the First New Asian Games in unity against imperialism."

New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, September 11

According to a recent announcement by the Cambodian National Organizing Committee for the First New Asian Games, by August 31, sixteen countries and regions' sports organizations have expressed their definite participation in the First New Asian Games, which will be held in Phnom Penh on November 25 this year.

    亚洲新运会是一次反美示威
    柬埔寨组织委员会发表公报谴责美帝破坏阴谋
    已有十六个国家和地区的体育组织表示参加这次新运会
    新华社金边十一日电  据柬埔寨新闻社十日报道，第一届亚洲新运会柬埔寨全国组织委员会发表公报，着重阐明这次运动会所具有的重大政治意义，并强烈谴责美帝国主义者及其走狗对这次运动会的破坏阴谋。
    公报说，“目前，美帝国主义正在把它的反革命的全球战略重心从欧洲转移到亚洲。它正在加紧侵略亚洲，妄图把侵略战争强加在亚洲各国人民身上，继续或重新在各方面奴役亚洲人民。
      “可以预言，在这种情况下举行的第一届亚洲新运会定将显示亚洲各国人民团结起来反对美帝国主义的共同意志，并且将成为反对美帝国主义的一次示威。”
    公报指出，第一届新运会举行以来，亚洲体育事业的迅速发展和各国之间相互不断的访问，特别是即将举行的第一届亚洲新运会，这一切都有力地表明，亚洲新兴力量各国人民在反对帝国主义垄断和操纵国际体育的斗争中已经取得了许多胜利。
    公报强调指出，“在世界各国人民，特别是亚非拉人民革命高潮面前，帝国主义和殖民主义今天已陷于崩溃状态。作为反动势力支柱的美帝国主义，遭到了惨重的失败，在南越战场上已经可耻地被打败了。帝国主义为了延长自己的岌岌可危的寿命，为了使自己免遭完蛋的命运，正在作垂死的挣扎，因此，不惜采取任何阴谋诡计来破坏各国人民团结反帝的共同事业。
    “美帝国主义者及其走狗发出了反对亚洲新兴力量人民的叫嚣，策划阴谋以破坏亚洲各国人民的团结并对第一届亚洲新运会进行捣乱，破坏这次运动会。但是，我们有充分的理由相信，亚洲新兴力量的觉醒的人民，他们共命运，必将团结一致和加强合作，互相鼓励和互相支持，以彻底粉碎美帝国主义者及其走狗的各种阴谋，成功地举行团结反帝的第一届亚洲新运会。”
    新华社金边十一日电据第一届亚洲新运会柬埔寨全国组织委员会最近宣布，到八月三十一日为止，已有十六个国家和地区的体育组织表示肯定参加将于今年十一月二十五日在金边举行的第一届亚洲新兴力量运动会。
