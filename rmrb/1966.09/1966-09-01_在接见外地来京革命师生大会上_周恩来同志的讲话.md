Comrades! Students!

	You are welcome!

	You have come from all parts of the country to the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to the capital of the people, Beijing. We extend to you a warm welcome.

	Beijing is where Chairman Mao resides. Our great leader, Chairman Mao, is the great helmsman of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao is our great teacher, our great helmsman, and the red sun in our hearts.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was initiated by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is closely connected with the masses, trusts the masses without limit, and supports the masses' spirit of initiative. The revolutionary people of the whole country have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call and launched a magnificent high tide of the Cultural Revolution.

	The "Decision Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is the program of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This document tells us that we must let the masses educate themselves, liberate themselves, and rise up to make revolution. We must take this decision as our battle weapon and our guide to action in carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All revolutionary comrades should study it seriously, repeatedly, and master it so as to apply it.

	Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new high tide. Revolutionary organizations, including the Red Guards, have been formed by young people from all over the country. This is a great revolutionary innovation. Our Red Guards have smashed the "four olds" and established the "four news," and have become the vanguard in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Your spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and rebel has won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary cadres throughout the country. We hail the heroic Red Guards! We salute our Red Guards! We salute the revolutionary youth!

	Our Red Guards have been established with the People's Liberation Army as their model. "Learn from the PLA" is the battle cry of the Red Guards. You should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, read Chairman Mao's books, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and put Chairman Mao's teachings into practice. Always be good students and good fighters of Chairman Mao, always be loyal to the Party, to the people, to Chairman Mao, and to Mao Zedong Thought. Like the PLA, always serve the people wholeheartedly, maintain close ties with the masses, follow the mass line, and always be faithful servants of the people. Learn from the PLA's three-eight style, observe the three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention, protect the interests of the masses, safeguard state property, and create a good socialist atmosphere. The Red Guards should build themselves into a combat force with high political awareness and strict organization and discipline, and become a reliable reserve force for the PLA.

	We must dare to struggle and be good at struggling. Always pay attention to using the method of class analysis, develop progressive forces, win over the intermediate forces, unite the majority, and concentrate our forces to strike at a handful of capitalist roaders. In the struggle, we must use ideological struggle, not physical struggle. Only ideological struggle can educate the masses and most effectively defeat the enemy. Our Red Guards will certainly grow in the struggle and become all-round fighters.

	Now, students from all over the country are coming to Beijing to exchange experiences, and Beijing students are also going to other places to make revolutionary connections. We think this is a very good thing, and we support you. The Central Committee has decided that representatives of all university students and part of the middle school students from all over the country will come to Beijing in batches. Local students and students from outside should, on the principle of jointly doing a good job in the Cultural Revolution, strengthen revolutionary unity. If there are problems or different opinions, they should be solved by means of investigation and research and equal consultation. Everyone knows that the Cultural Revolution in every locality and unit must rely on the local and unit masses to do it themselves in order to do it well and thoroughly. We believe that the nationwide revolutionary connection will certainly powerfully promote the deep development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Comrades! Students!

	Revolution is not an easy thing. To achieve victory, we must overcome all obstacles and difficulties. We believe that you will certainly be able to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp and apply the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the broad revolutionary masses, rely on your own strength, overcome various obstacles, and conquer all difficulties, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Long live the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
	Long live the great proletarian dictatorship!
	Long live the great Communist Party of China!
	Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
	Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    在接见外地来京革命师生大会上
    周恩来同志的讲话同志们！同学们！
    你们好！
    你们从祖国各地，来到无产阶级文化大革命的中心，来到人民的首都北京，我们表示热烈的欢迎。
    北京是毛主席居住的地方。我们伟大的领袖毛主席是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大统帅。毛主席是我们伟大的导师，伟大的舵手，是我们心中的红太阳。
    无产阶级文化大革命是毛主席亲自发动的。毛主席同群众心连着心，无限地信任群众，支持群众的首创精神。全国革命人民热烈响应毛主席的号召，掀起了轰轰烈烈的文化大革命的高潮。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的《关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领。这个文件告诉我们，必须让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，自己起来闹革命。我们必须把这个决定，当做我们进行无产阶级文化大革命的战斗武器，做为我们的行动指南。一切革命同志，都应该认真地反复地学习它，熟悉它，掌握它，运用它。
    现在，无产阶级文化大革命开始了新的高潮。全国各地的青少年组织了红卫兵和别的革命组织，这是一项伟大的革命创举。我们的红卫兵小将们，破“四旧”，立“四新”，充当了无产阶级文化大革命冲锋陷阵的急先锋。你们那种敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢于革命、敢于造反的精神，得到了全国广大工农兵和革命干部的热烈支持。我们向英雄的红卫兵欢呼！向我们的红卫兵致敬！向革命的青少年致敬！
    我们的红卫兵是以解放军为榜样建立起来的。大学解放军，是红卫兵的战斗口号。要像解放军那样，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，活学活用毛主席的著作；永远做毛主席的好学生、好战士；永远忠于党，忠于人民，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想。要像解放军那样全心全意为人民服务，密切联系群众，执行群众路线，永远做人民忠实的勤务员。要学习解放军的三八作风，遵守三大纪律八项注意，保护群众利益，保卫国家财产，造成良好的社会主义的新风气。红卫兵要建设成为一支具有高度政治觉悟和高度组织性纪律性的战斗队伍，成为解放军的可靠的后备军。
    我们要敢于斗争，善于斗争。时刻都要注意运用阶级分析的方法，注意发展进步力量，争取中间力量，团结大多数，集中力量打击一小撮资产阶级右派分子。在斗争中，要用文斗，不要武斗。文斗，才能教育群众，才能最有效地斗垮敌人。我们的红卫兵，一定能够在斗争中成长起来，成为智勇双全的闯将。
    现在，全国各地的同学到北京来交流经验，北京同学也到各地去进行革命串连。我们认为，这是一种很好的事情，我们支持你们。中央决定，全国各地大学生的全部和中学生的一部分代表，分期分批到北京来。本地的学生，和外来的学生，要在共同搞好文化大革命的原则基础上，加强革命的团结。有问题，有不同意见，要用调查研究、平等协商的方法来解决。大家都知道，各地方各单位的文化大革命，都要依靠本地本单位的群众自己动手来干，才能真正搞得好，搞得彻底。我们相信，全国大串连的革命行动，一定能够有力地推动无产阶级文化大革命深入发展。
    同志们！同学们！
    革命是一件不容易的事，要取得胜利，必须战胜一切阻力，克服一切困难。我们相信你们一定能够高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掌握和运用毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条，同广大的工农兵在一起，同广大的革命群众在一起，依靠自己的力量，克服各种阻力，战胜一切困难，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
