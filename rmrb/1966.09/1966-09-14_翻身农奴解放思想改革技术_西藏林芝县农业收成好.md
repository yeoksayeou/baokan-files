The vast serfs of Lhokha County in the Tibetan Plateau are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in earnest, daring to struggle and daring to win, and have achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture.

This year, Lhokha County's total grain output increased by more than 10 percent compared to last year. Not only did the winter crops have a good harvest, but the spring-sown crops also had a bumper harvest. Many farmers studied Chairman Mao's works, liberated their thoughts, and reformed old cultivation techniques. Eighty percent of the cultivated land in the county was plowed with new-style walking plows, laying a good foundation for this year's increase in production.

    据新华社拉萨十三日电　西藏高原林芝县广大翻身农奴高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，夺得了农业大丰收。
    今年林芝县粮食总产量比去年增产百分之十以上。不仅越冬作物丰收，春播作物也丰收。许多农民学习了毛主席著作，解放了思想，改革了旧的耕作技术。全县百分之八十的耕地都用新式步犁翻耕，为今年增产打下了良好的基础。
