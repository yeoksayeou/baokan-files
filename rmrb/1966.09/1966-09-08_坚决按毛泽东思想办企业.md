Title: Resolutely Implementing Mao Zedong Thought in Enterprise Management

Edition: 6

The anti-party, anti-socialist element Sun Yefang has proposed a revisionist economic program with a clear core: profit-first. He aims to use profit-first to oppose proletarian political leadership and to oppose managing enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, thereby "peacefully transforming" socialist enterprises into capitalist ones.

To thoroughly smash his revisionist economic program, we must uproot the profit-first core.

Implementing profit-first will change the nature of enterprises

The profit-first approach advocated by Sun Yefang is not unfamiliar to older workers who have experienced capitalist exploitation. They say that as soon as profit-first is mentioned, they think of the capitalist's methods. If our enterprises implement profit-first, capitalist management ideas and methods will quickly develop. In such enterprises, the pursuit of output and profits will be paramount, regardless of the needs of the state and users; there will be deception of the state; personal gain at public expense; buying low and selling high, speculation; chaotic "cooperation," mutual competition; shoddy work, disregard for quality; extravagance and waste, embezzlement and theft; bonus-first, severe rewards and punishments; scientific experiments for fame and profit. In short, as long as there is profit to be made, any means will be used, and all kinds of evil deeds will be committed.

In enterprises where profit-first is implemented, people are hired without regard to their politics. "As long as the cat catches mice, it doesn't matter if it's black or white." As long as someone has the "ability" to make money, regardless of who they are, they will be promoted and used. They do not regard workers as the masters of the enterprise, do not rely on the working class to manage the enterprise, but follow the expert and authority lines. They want technology but not politics, seeing things but not people. They oppose political and ideological work, oppose the "two participations, one reform, three combinations." They stand aloof, act like officials, and oppress workers with "control," "management," and "pressure," using forced orders and overtime as means to complete tasks. They do not want the Party's leadership, do not want democratic centralism, but implement a one-person system and a one-man show.

Such enterprises, where the leaders are in sharp conflict with the working class, are either bureaucrats or bourgeois elements.

Such enterprises are actually not socialist enterprises but capitalist enterprises. They implement bourgeois dictatorship, not proletarian dictatorship. They are "independent kingdoms."

Sun Yefang advocates profit-first, just like the modern revisionists in the Soviet Union, who advocate relying on material incentives to motivate people. Before Khrushchev was overthrown, he always took the opportunity to advocate material incentives. The Soviet Union's "Political Economy" textbook (revised fourth edition) even called material incentives the "motive force for the development of socialist production." The September 1965 resolution of the CPSU Central Committee called "material incentives" a "powerful means to push socialist economy towards communism." Sun Yefang also vigorously advocates using profit-sharing and bonuses to stimulate enterprises to pursue profits and to "inspire" the enthusiasm of the staff. When we criticize material incentives, he still defends himself by saying, "Material incentives cannot be said to be completely wrong."

The "principle" of material incentives advocated by Soviet revisionists and Sun Yefang is a pure capitalist principle!

In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie relies on exploitation and oppression to eat, relies on deception and cheating to eat, and relies on material incentives to eat. They are profit-first, seeking only profit, "money can move mountains," and "money can make the devil push the mill."

The Soviet revisionist leadership's emphasis on material incentives is a continuation of capitalist practices. They emphasize material incentives, leading people to focus on personal interests. As a result, bourgeois individualism has greatly developed, and economicism has spread widely. People's revolutionary will is corrupted, unity among workers is destroyed, and the income gap between workers, peasants, and the general intelligentsia and a small number of people is widening, leading to class polarization. The Soviet revisionist clique's emphasis on material incentives is against the interests of the Soviet working people and can only make people move away from socialism.

In a socialist society, the enthusiasm of the broad masses is not motivated by material incentives but by political leadership and by continuously raising people's political consciousness. The motive force for the development of socialist production is class struggle, not material incentives. Revisionism, on the one hand, downplays class struggle, and on the other hand, passes off material incentives as the "motive force." This is a deceitful trick. Sun Yefang says that Khrushchev's advocacy of material incentives "did some good things." For whom did he do these "good things"? This can only be for a few bourgeois elements, allowing them to use material incentives as a cover to arbitrarily seize the fruits of the people's labor.

Sun Yefang's fallacy of profit-first has caused great indignation among the workers. They firmly declare: We must defend the fruits of the revolution, defend the socialist homeland won with blood and sweat, resolutely manage enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, and never allow the old society to return, never allow Sun Yefang to carry out "peaceful evolution." They say, "We will smash the profit-first sign with an iron hammer" and "root out the ghosts and snakes like Sun Yefang." The workers' indignation is the indignation of all revolutionary people. Our struggle against Sun Yefang's "profit-first" is indeed a struggle to consolidate and develop the socialist system against the restoration of the capitalist system.

Taking class struggle as the key, adhering to the socialist direction

To promote his profit-first approach, Sun Yefang goes to great lengths to oppose political and ideological work, opposing the transformation of people's thinking.

The fundamental difference between our management of enterprises and the revisionists' management lies in adhering to proletarian political leadership and Mao Zedong Thought leadership. Our purpose in production is not for profit but for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution; to build our country into a powerful socialist state and gradually transition to communism; to support the world revolution, overthrow imperialism and all reactionaries, and realize a new world without imperialism, capitalism, or exploitation of man by man. Therefore, we must manage enterprises by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key, consolidating and developing socialism, avoiding revisionism, and preventing the restoration of capitalism. We must establish a revolutionary leadership core, strengthen the party committee system, and seriously implement democratic centralism to ensure the Party's absolute leadership. We must thoroughly follow the mass line and launch mass movements. We must push forward the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. Every enterprise should be a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, combining industry and agriculture, and combining culture and military affairs. These are the main contents of managing enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought and implementing political leadership. Sun Yefang says that "achieving the greatest effect with the least labor consumption (both living labor and objectified labor) is 'political leadership.'" His plot is to use capitalist profit-first to replace proletarian political leadership.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, and the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm are long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense."

In recent years, the facts of the socialist education movement have shown that class struggle within enterprises is complex and sharp. The old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits left by the exploiting classes still have a great influence within enterprises, poisoning the minds of the staff. Enterprises still have untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and illegal bourgeois elements. Some enterprises are controlled by those in power who take the capitalist road, and some enterprises still have bourgeois reactionary "authorities" and "experts" who promote the revisionist and capitalist line, seriously restricting the creativity and enthusiasm of the working class. Sun Yefang's revisionist economic program reflects the interests of the above ghosts and snakes, meets their needs, and provides "theoretical" basis for their activities to restore capitalism.

The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" points out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must be combined with the socialist education movement in urban and rural areas. Carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist education movement to the end is the fundamental guarantee for enterprises to adhere to the socialist road, uproot revisionism, and prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao recently called for: All industries should be turned into revolutionary schools that combine industry and agriculture, culture and military affairs. Chairman Mao pointed out: Workers should focus on industry but also learn military affairs, politics, and culture. They should also carry out socialist education movements and criticize bourgeois ideas. In places with conditions, they should also engage in agricultural and sideline production, such as the Daqing Oil Field. Chairman Mao's great call has profound significance for preventing the restoration of capitalism, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and gradually transitioning to communism.

Strengthen political work, prioritize studying and applying Chairman Mao's works

To turn enterprises into revolutionary schools, the most important and fundamental thing is to prioritize studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in all work.

Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, and the Marxism-Leninism that transforms people's souls in contemporary times. It is the strongest ideological weapon of the proletariat. Only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and working hard on them can we eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology, achieving the transformation of people's thinking. Only with the transformation of thinking can we have a heart for the motherland and an eye for the world, serving the people wholeheartedly.

Sun Yefang attacks political leadership, saying that we emphasize political and ideological work as "idealism," as "talking about politics without business," "talking about politics without economics," and "forgetting economics when doing economic work." This is a rejection of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide economics, business, and everything.

We highly value political leadership and emphasize the great role of correct ideology, which is not "idealism" but adheres to dialectical materialism. Chairman Mao pointed out: Matter turns into spirit, and spirit turns into matter. "The correct ideology representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world." All work starts with ideology. Only by carrying out ideological revolution can we do a good job. Workers say well: "People manage machines, ideology manages people," "People change ideology, production changes," "With Mao Zedong Thought in mind, all work can be done well." This is an iron fact. Only people like Sun Yefang, who close their eyes to facts, overestimate themselves, and dream of restoring capitalism in a powerful socialist China, are the greatest idealists.

The facts of the socialist education movement show that where enterprises relax political and ideological work, bourgeois ideology runs rampant, and economic and technical work go astray; conversely, where political and ideological work is strengthened, the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses is aroused, self-reliance, and striving for progress, overcoming difficulties, achieving one victory after another. This shows that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," which is an unshakable truth. Sun Yefang's nonsense about "putting political and ideological work in the first place" is a "universal flaw" and is intended to cut off the lifeline of economic work, making us lose our soul. Political and ideological work is the work of transforming people's souls. Sun Yefang vigorously downgrades its role, calling political work "cleaning up," which is the most despicable slander.

Sun Yefang says we "replace the mass line and political leadership with objective economic laws," which is nonsense. The mass line of "from the masses, to the masses" is our Party's fundamental political and organizational line. Chairman Mao said: "The people, and only the people, are the creators of world history." We must manage socialist enterprises by firmly trusting the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' pioneering spirit; we must be bold and mobilize the masses, mobilize all positive factors, launch mass movements, and oppose managing enterprises in a cold and lonely manner relying on a few people. The facts prove that enterprises that do this will show a scene of full enthusiasm, striving for progress, and revolutionary spirit, achieving more, faster, better, and cheaper results. Managing enterprises with the mass line is in accordance with objective laws. Sun Yefang's so-called "objective economic laws" are just nonsense. Sun Yefang and his ilk do not understand the mass line, do not put the masses in their eyes, and stand in opposition to the masses. Such bourgeois representatives, like them, can talk about recognizing and mastering "objective economic laws"?

The historical experience of our country's revolution and construction proves that to build socialism, we must advance on both the material and spiritual fronts, using the spiritual front to drive the material front. Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of these two fronts. As long as we always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, promote revolution, and promote production, we can ensure that enterprises will never change color and that socialist construction will always develop rapidly, efficiently, and economically.

    坚决按毛泽东思想办企业
    金霄舍
    反党反社会主义分子孙冶方提出的修正主义经济纲领，有一个明显的核心，就是利润挂帅。他就是要用利润挂帅来反对无产阶级政治挂帅，反对按毛泽东思想办企业，把社会主义企业“和平演变”为资本主义企业。
    我们要彻底粉碎他的修正主义经济纲领，必须挖掉利润挂帅这个核心。
    实行利润挂帅，企业就要改变颜色
    孙冶方所主张的利润挂帅，对于受过资本主义剥削的老工人，并不陌生。他们说，一提起利润挂帅，就会联想到资本家那套手法。我们的企业如果实行利润挂帅，资本主义的一套经营思想和管理方法就会很快发展起来。在这样的企业里，必然是一味追求产值，追求利润，不顾国家和用户需要；弄虚作假，欺骗国家；损公肥私，损人利己；贱买贵卖，投机倒把；乱搞“协作”，互相竞争；粗制滥造，不顾质量；铺张浪费，贪污盗窃；奖金挂帅，大惩大罚；科学实验，为名为利。总之，只要有利可图，就不择手段，什么坏事都干得出来。
    在利润挂帅的企业里，用人不问政治，“不管白猫黑猫，能捉老鼠的就是好猫”，只要有赚钱“本领”，不管他是什么人，都一律提拔重用。他们不把工人看作是企业的主人，不依靠工人阶级办企业，而是走专家路线、“权威”路线。他们只要技术，不要政治，见物不见人。他们反对政治思想工作，反对“两参一改三结合”。他们高高在上，做官当老爷，对工人实行“卡”、“管”、“压”，把强迫命令、加班加点，作为完成任务的手段。他们不要党的领导，不要民主集中制，而是实行“一长制”，“一言堂”。
    这样的企业，领导人必然同工人阶级处于尖锐对立的状态。他们不是死官僚主义分子，就是资产阶级分子。
    这样的企业，实际上不是社会主义的企业，而是资本主义企业。它们实行的是资产阶级专政，不是无产阶级专政。它们是“独立王国”。
    孙冶方提倡利润挂帅，同苏联现代修正主义者一样，都是主张依靠物质刺激来调动人们的“积极性”。大利润迷赫鲁晓夫下台以前，总是一有机会就宣扬物质刺激。苏联《政治经济学教科书》（增订第四版），还把物质刺激叫做“社会主义生产发展的动力”。去年九月的苏共中央决议，把“物质刺激”称作是“推动社会主义经济向共产主义迈进的强大手段”。孙冶方也竭力鼓吹用利润提成和奖金的办法，来刺激企业追求利润和“鼓舞”职工干劲。当我们批判物质刺激的时候，他还辩护说：“物质刺激，不能说绝对不对。”
    苏联修正主义者和孙冶方之流所宣扬的物质刺激“原则”，是道道地地的资本主义原则！
    在资本主义社会里，资产阶级就是靠剥削压迫吃饭，靠欺骗愚弄吃饭，靠物质刺激吃饭。他们是金钱挂帅，唯利是图，“钱能通神”，“有钱能使鬼推磨”。
    苏联修正主义领导集团大搞物质刺激，就是继承了资本主义的衣钵。他们大搞物质刺激，引导人们斤斤计较个人利益。因之，资产阶级个人主义大大发展，经济主义思想大肆泛滥。人们的革命意志受到腐蚀，工人内部的团结受到破坏，工人、农民和一般知识分子同极小一部分人的收入差距越来越大，社会的阶级分化加剧。苏联修正主义集团搞物质刺激，是违背苏联劳动人民的利益的，这只能使人民离社会主义越来越远。
    社会主义社会调动广大人民群众的积极性，不是靠物质刺激，而是靠政治挂帅，靠不断提高人们的政治觉悟。社会主义生产发展的动力，也决不是物质刺激，而是阶级斗争。修正主义一方面抹煞阶级斗争，一方面把物质刺激冒充为“动力”，这是一种偷天换日的手法。孙冶方说，赫鲁晓夫提出物质刺激是“做了一些好事”。这到底是为谁做“好事”？这只能是为少数资产阶级分子做好事，让他们打着物质刺激的幌子，任意窃取人民的劳动果实。
    孙冶方利润挂帅的谬论，已经在工人群众中引起了极大的愤慨。他们坚决表示：一定要保卫革命胜利果实，保卫血汗换来的社会主义江山，坚决按毛泽东思想办企业，决不许旧社会再来，决不许孙冶方搞“和平演变”。他们“要抡起铁锤砸烂利润挂帅的招牌”，“把孙冶方之流的牛鬼蛇神连根铲除”。工人群众的这种义愤，也是一切革命人民的义愤。我们同孙冶方“利润挂帅”的斗争，确实是一场巩固和发展社会主义制度同复辟资本主义制度的斗争。
    以阶级斗争为纲，坚持社会主义方向
    孙冶方为了推行他的利润挂帅，就千方百计地反对政治思想工作，反对人的思想革命化。
    我们办企业跟修正主义办企业的根本不同点，就在于坚持无产阶级政治挂帅、毛泽东思想挂帅。我们搞生产的目的，不是为了利润，而是为了中国革命和世界革命；为了把我国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家，将来逐步过渡到共产主义；为了支援世界革命，打倒帝国主义和一切反动派，实现一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有人剥削人的新世界。因此，我们办企业，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，巩固和发展社会主义，避免修正主义，防止资本主义复辟。必须建立革命化的领导核心，健全党委制，认真实行民主集中制，保证党的绝对领导。必须彻底走群众路线，大搞群众运动。要把阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动不断向前推进。每个企业都应当办成亦工亦农、能文能武的毛泽东思想的大学校。这些，就是按照毛泽东思想办企业，实现政治挂帅的主要内容。孙冶方说什么“以最少的劳动消耗（活劳动与物化劳动的消耗）取得最大的效果”就是“政治挂帅”。他的阴谋就是用资本主义的利润挂帅来偷换无产阶级政治挂帅。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”
    几年来，社会主义教育运动的事实表明，企业中的阶级斗争是复杂的、尖锐的。剥削阶级遗留下来的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，在企业中还有很大的影响，毒害着职工群众的思想。企业中还存在着没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右和不法的资产阶级分子。有的企业被走资本主义道路的当权派所把持，有的企业还存在着资产阶级反动“权威”、“专家”，他们推行修正主义、资本主义的路线，严重束缚着工人群众的创造性和积极性。孙冶方的修正主义经济纲领，正是反映了上述牛鬼蛇神的利益，适应他们的需要，为他们的资本主义复辟活动提供“理论”根据。
    《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》指出，必须把文化大革命同城乡社会主义教育运动结合起来进行。把无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义教育运动进行到底，是企业坚持社会主义道路、挖掉修正主义根子、防止资本主义复辟的根本保证。
    毛主席最近号召：各行各业都要办成亦工亦农，亦文亦武的革命化大学校。毛主席指出：工人以工为主，也要兼学军事、政治、文化。也要搞社会主义教育运动，也要批判资产阶级。在有条件的地方，也要从事农副业生产，例如大庆油田那样。毛主席这个伟大的号召，对于防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政、逐步向共产主义过渡，具有十分深远的意义。
    加强政治工作，把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位
    要把企业办成革命化的大学校，千条万条，最重要最根本的一条，就是要把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。
    毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是当代改造人们灵魂的马克思列宁主义，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。只有活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，才能灭资产阶级思想，兴无产阶级思想，实现人的思想革命化。只有思想革命化了，才能胸怀祖国，放眼世界，全心全意为人民服务。
    孙冶方攻击政治挂帅，说我们强调政治思想工作是“唯心论”，是“脱离了业务来空谈政治”，“脱离了经济来谈政治”，“做经济工作的忘记了经济”，这就是反对用毛泽东思想统帅经济，统帅业务，统帅一切。
    我们极端重视政治挂帅，强调正确思想的伟大作用，决不是什么“唯心论”，而是坚持了辩证唯物论。毛主席指出：物质变精神，精神变物质。“而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”一切工作，思想先行。只有搞好思想革命，才能做好工作。工人群众说得好：“人管机器，思想管人”，“人变思想，生产变样”，“头脑里有了毛泽东思想，一切工作都能搞好”。这是铁的事实。只有像孙冶方那样的人，闭眼不看事实，不自量力，梦想在强大的社会主义中国复辟资本主义，才是最大的唯心论者。
    社会主义教育运动的事实表明，哪个企业放松了政治思想工作，资产阶级思想就泛滥成灾，经济工作和技术工作就走到邪路上去；相反，凡是加强了政治思想工作的地方，就振起了广大职工的革命精神，自力更生，奋发图强，排除万难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。这正是说明“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”，是一个颠扑不破的真理。孙冶方胡说“把政治思想放在第一位”是“普遍的缺点”，无非是想抽掉经济工作的生命线，使我们失去灵魂。政治思想工作是改造人的灵魂的工作。孙冶方竭力贬低它的作用，把政治工作说成是“擦屁股”的，这是最卑鄙不过的污蔑。
    孙冶方说我们“把群众路线和政治挂帅来代替客观经济规律”，也是无稽之谈。“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线，是我们党的根本的政治路线和组织路线。毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我们办社会主义企业，必须坚决信任群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神；必须“敢”字当头，放手发动群众，调动一切积极因素，大搞群众运动，反对依靠少数人冷冷清清办企业。事实证明，凡是这样做的企业，就会出现鼓足干劲，力争上游，热气腾腾的革命景象，就会实现多快好省。用群众路线办企业，正是符合客观规律的。孙冶方像煞有介事地大讲什么“客观经济规律”，实际上是瞎说一气。孙冶方之流根本不懂得走群众路线，不把群众放在眼里，站在与群众对立的地位，像他们这样的资产阶级代表人物，还能谈得上什么认识和掌握“客观经济规律”？
    我国革命和建设的历史经验证明，搞社会主义，要从物质和精神这两条战线向前进攻，以精神战线带动物质战线。毛泽东思想就是这两条战线的总火车头。只要我们永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，就可以保证企业永不变色，使社会主义建设永远多快好省地向前发展。
