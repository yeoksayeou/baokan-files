Today in the afternoon, a moving scene unfolded in the square in front of Beijing's People's Park (formerly known as the Summer Palace). Foreign friends participating in the Beijing International Table Tennis Invitational Tournament, along with Chinese athletes, came to enjoy the park. Together with the people who were already there, they held high portraits of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, and red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," chanting slogans such as "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the great Mao Zedong Thought!" They sang revolutionary songs like "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea," expressing their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

During the park outing and gathering, Vietnamese and Japanese friends spontaneously sang "We Walk on the Great Road" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea." Korean friends, after singing "Socialism is Good," immediately followed with "The Song of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army." A Nepalese player played "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea" on the guitar, and friends from Yemen, Cambodia, Pakistan, and other countries joined in, singing loudly to praise the great leader Chairman Mao.

Chinese Red Guards expressed their deep friendship during the park outing by presenting copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to some foreign friends. When Vietnamese, Syrian, and Palestinian friends received "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from Chinese Red Guards, they could no longer contain their excitement. They held up portraits of Chairman Mao and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to everyone, shouting in Chinese: "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

Palestinian athlete Taoufiq Habib opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the cover page, gazing at it with deep affection, repeatedly shouting "Long live Mao Zedong!" Habib told Chinese athlete Zhuang Zedong, "I deeply love Mao Zedong because he is a great leader!" He also requested another copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from the Chinese hosts to give to his teacher upon returning home. When he learned that this request would be quickly fulfilled, Habib happily led everyone in singing "The East Is Red" in Chinese again. The team leader, Shurafa, said, "After reading Mao Zedong's works, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao truly believes in the power of the people. He is the great leader of the world's people. Even in the most complex and difficult situations, he can lead the people to victory."

Shurafa's words expressed the common feelings of many foreign friends. Syrian team coach Hafez Nadim said, "The Chinese people are great. Since coming to China, I have seen with my own eyes the great achievements of the Chinese people and their noble character. All of this should be attributed to Mao Zedong Thought and the great leader Chairman Mao. The Chinese people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will definitely go from victory to victory."

Amidst the enthusiastic applause, a Chinese student presented a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to a Vietnamese friend. The book had a few lines of bold text: "Presented to the heroic warriors from the front lines of the struggle against American imperialism! Long live the great unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples! Long live Chairman Mao!"

The lively and lively park outing and gathering came to an end. Many foreign friends stuck their hands out of the slowly moving cars, holding up copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to bid farewell to the Chinese crowds rushing forward. At this moment, the song "The East Is Red" and the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed continuously.

    各国乒乓球运动员畅游首都人民公园
    齐声歌颂伟大领袖毛主席
    红卫兵向外国朋友赠送了《毛主席语录》，外国朋友激动地高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    新华社五日讯　今天下午，在首都人民公园（原名颐和园）前的广场上，出现了众人高唱《东方红》的动人场面。参加北京国际乒乓球邀请赛的许多外国朋友和中国运动员前来游园的时候，同正在这里游览的人们一道，高举我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的像片和红色的《毛主席语录》，高呼“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁”“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁”等口号，齐声高唱《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲，表达了他们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的感情。
    在游园联欢中，越南和日本朋友情不自禁地唱起《我们走在大路上》和《大海航行靠舵手》。朝鲜朋友刚唱完《社会主义好》，接着又唱开了《中国人民志愿军战歌》。尼泊尔选手用吉他奏起《东方红》《大海航行靠舵手》的乐曲，也门、柬埔寨、巴基斯坦等国家的朋友，随着优美的旋律，和他一起放声歌颂伟大的领袖毛主席。
    中国的红卫兵们在游园中向外国朋友们表达了深厚的情谊。他们向一些外国朋友赠送了《毛主席语录》。当越南、叙利亚、巴勒斯坦的朋友们从中国红卫兵手里接过《毛主席语录》时，再也无法抑制激动的心情，他们逢人就把毛主席像和《毛主席语录》高高举起，用汉语高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“毛泽东思想万岁！”
    巴勒斯坦选手陶·哈比卜翻开《毛主席语录》扉页的毛主席像，用深情的目光端详来、端详去，不时高喊“毛泽东万岁！”哈比卜对中国运动员庄则栋说：“我深深热爱毛泽东，因为毛泽东是伟大的领袖！”他还要求中国主人再赠给他一本《毛主席语录》，他回国后要送给他的老师。当他知道这一要求将很快得到满足时，哈比卜高兴地用汉语又一次带领大家唱起《东方红》。这个代表团的团长舒拉法说：“我读了毛泽东著作后，深深感到毛主席非常相信人民的力量，他是世界人民的伟大领袖。即使在最复杂、最困难的情况下，也能够领导人民取得胜利。”
    舒拉法团长这番话，说出了许多外国朋友的共同心情。叙利亚队教练哈·纳迪姆就这样说：“中国人民是伟大的。来到中国以后，我亲眼看到中国人民取得了很大成就，中国人民具有高尚的品格。所有这些，都应该归功于毛泽东思想，归功于伟大的领袖毛主席。中国人民是用毛泽东思想武装起来的。中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，一定能从胜利走向胜利。”
    在热烈的掌声中，一个中国学生把《毛主席语录》赠送给越南朋友，语录本上写着几行醒目的大字：“送给来自抗美救国斗争前线的英雄战士！中越人民大团结万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    生动活泼的游园联欢结束了。许多外国朋友从徐徐开动的汽车上伸出双手，举起《毛主席语录》本，和涌向前来的中国群众告别。这时，《东方红》的歌声和“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声连绵不断。
