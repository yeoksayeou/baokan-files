Revolutionary teachers and students and revolutionary masses in the capital have highly carried forward the spirit of class friendship and warmly welcomed comrades from all parts of the country who have come to the side of Chairman Mao.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated September 20th, revolutionary teachers and students from all parts of the country have received warm welcomes from the Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary masses in the capital. People enthusiastically welcome revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital who have come to Beijing, the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to be by the side of the great leader Chairman Mao.

Many schools, mass activity venues, and streets and alleys in the capital are all decorated with banners, slogans, leaflets, and big-character posters warmly welcoming revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital who have come to Beijing for revolutionary linkage. Revolutionary teachers and students and revolutionary masses in the capital express to revolutionary comrades from all parts of the country: You have traveled thousands of miles to the heart of the motherland—Beijing, without fatigue. You have brought the sincere love of revolutionary masses from all parts of the country for Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, as well as precious revolutionary experiences. We will definitely learn from you humbly and resolutely support your revolutionary actions.

The Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students in the capital have done everything possible to create conditions to facilitate revolutionary linkage for revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital. Revolutionary teachers and students at Peking University either introduce the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at their school or send people to the residences of revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital who have come to Beijing, to exchange experiences and learn from each other. Recently, the Red Guards at Peking University also held a mass meeting for revolutionary linkage, inviting revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital to share their experiences in the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary young fighters at the Red Guard School (formerly Tsinghua Middle School) have studied the works of Chairman Mao and the Sixteen Points together with revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital who have come to Beijing, summarizing the experiences of the previous stage of struggle.

The Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary masses in the capital have also shown class friendship in caring for the living conditions of revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital. In the reception office for revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital under the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the staff enthusiastically arrange food and accommodation for revolutionary teachers and students who have come to Beijing from outside the capital. To facilitate revolutionary teachers and students to go to schools outside the city for revolutionary linkage, special direct buses have also been arranged. Revolutionary teachers and students at the Workers-Peasants-Dancers School (formerly the Beijing Ballet School) and the China Dance School have already received a large number of teachers and students from outside the capital who have come to Beijing. On the evening of September 13th, when the revolutionary teachers and students of these two schools heard that another batch of teachers and students from outside the capital had arrived in Beijing without a place to stay, they enthusiastically beat drums and gongs to welcome this batch of revolutionary comrades to stay at their school. Revolutionary workers in the service industry have enthusiastically welcomed and supported revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital who have come to Beijing for revolutionary linkage. Many restaurants have broken the conventions of the catering industry and served revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital day and night without stopping. Some canteen workers have even delivered food to the door, pushing carts full of food to the residences of revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital who have come to Beijing. Revolutionary workers in the transportation sector have also done their best to reasonably dispatch vehicles, speed up vehicle turnover, and transport revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital who have come to Beijing. Revolutionary workers at the Beijing Railway Station regard the reception work as a glorious political task.

Many factory workers, cadres, and street residents in various enterprises and institutions have also enthusiastically cared for revolutionary teachers and students from outside the capital and done their best to provide convenient conditions for their revolutionary linkage.

    首都革命师生革命群众高度发扬阶级友爱精神
    热情接待来到毛主席身边的各地战友
    据新华社二十日讯  来自全国各地的革命师生，受到了首都红卫兵、革命师生、革命职工和革命群众的热情接待。人们热烈欢迎外地革命师生来到无产阶级文化大革命的中心——北京，来到伟大领袖毛主席身边。
    首都的许多学校，各个群众活动场所，以及大街小巷，到处张贴着热烈欢迎外地革命师生来京进行革命串连的标语、横幅和传单、大字报。首都的红卫兵、革命师生和革命群众向来自全国各地的革命战友们表示：你们不辞辛苦，千里迢迢来到了祖国的心脏——北京，你们带来了全国各地革命群众无限热爱毛主席和党中央的赤诚之心，也带来了宝贵的革命经验，我们一定虚心向你们学习，坚决支持你们的革命行动。
    首都红卫兵和广大革命师生，千方百计地创造条件便利外地革命师生进行革命串连。北京大学革命师生在本校或者派人到外地来京革命师生的住处介绍本校无产阶级文化大革命的情况，同外地来京革命战友交流经验，互相学习。北大红卫兵最近还举行了革命串连万人大会，请外地革命师生介绍他们的文化大革命的经验。红卫兵战校（原清华附中）的革命小将和外地来京革命师生一起学习毛主席著作和十六条，总结了前一阶段的斗争经验。
    首都红卫兵、革命师生和革命群众还满怀阶级友情，在生活方面关怀外地革命师生。在中共北京市委外地革命师生接待处里，工作人员热情地为外地来京革命师生安排食宿。为便于革命师生到城外的学校进行革命串连，还安排了专线直达汽车。工农兵舞蹈学校（原北京芭蕾舞蹈学校）和中国舞蹈学校的革命师生已经接待了大批外地来京师生。十三日晚，当这两个学校的革命师生听到又有一批外地到京的师生没有住处时，就主动热情地敲锣打鼓，欢迎这批来京的革命战友到自己学校来住。服务行业的广大革命职工，热烈地欢迎和支持外地革命师生来京进行革命串连。不少饭馆打破了饮食业的常规，昼夜不停地为外地革命师生服务。有的食堂的革命职工还送货上门，用推车把食品送到外地来京革命师生的住地。交通部门的革命职工，也尽最大努力合理调度车辆，加速车辆周转，接送外地来京革命师生。北京火车站的革命职工把接待工作看成是一项光荣的政治任务。
    许多工厂企业、机关的革命职工、干部和街道居民也热情关怀外地来京革命师生，尽力为他们进行革命串连提供方便条件。
