My wish has finally been fulfilled. I am an elementary school teacher from the Keerqin Middle Banner grasslands. When I started working in 1962, I yearned to purchase a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." To obtain this revolutionary treasure, I don't know how many miles I walked and how many times I went to the New China Bookstore.

I remember one day in July 1963, I heard that the New China Bookstore had received a batch of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." I walked twenty-four miles in the rain, and by the time I reached the bookstore, there was already a long line of people in front of the door. In the end, I still didn't get to buy it. On my way back to school, I thought: How many young people like me, who are eager to read Chairman Mao's books, are there in the world? Why not print more copies? It wasn't until the Cultural Revolution today that I understood that this was all the work of the counter-revolutionary gang of four.

The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought cannot be obstructed or blocked by anyone. The Central Committee's wise decision to mass-produce "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" has finally fulfilled my long-held wish! I bought a newly published set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." I held this precious book to my chest, unable to suppress my joy and excitement. Dearest Party! Dearest Chairman Mao! You understand us revolutionary youth the best, sending this revolutionary treasure from the capital to me. Dearest "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"! With you, we have the direction and strength of the revolution; with you, we have everything. In the future, I will definitely read Chairman Mao's books over and over, listen to Chairman Mao's words honestly, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions at all times, dedicating myself to being a good student of Chairman Mao for life.

    我的愿望终于实现了
    我是科尔沁中旗草原上的小学教师，一九六二年参加工作的时候，就渴望买到一部《毛泽东选集》。为了买到这套革命的法宝，我不知跑了多少里路，去了多少趟新华书店。
    记得一九六三年七月的一天，听说新华书店来了一批《毛泽东选集》，我冒雨步行二十四里，等我走到新华书店的时候，门前已经站了很长一排人。结果我还是没有买到。在回校的路上我就想：像我这样渴望要读毛主席书的青年何止万千！为什么不大量印制？直到文化大革命的今天，我才明白，这都是反革命黑帮搞的鬼。
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想是任何人阻挠和封锁不了的。党中央关于大量出版《毛泽东选集》的英明决定，使我积压在心里好几年的愿望终于实现了！我买到了一套新出版的《毛泽东选集》。我双手把这套宝书捧在胸前，抑制不住内心的欣喜和激动。最最亲爱的党啊！最最亲爱的毛主席！您最能了解我们革命青年，从首都把这套革命的法宝发行给我。最最心爱的《毛泽东选集》呀！有了你，我们就有了革命的方向和力量；有了你，我们就有了一切。今后我一定反反复复地读毛主席的书，老老实实地听毛主席的话，时时刻刻地照毛主席的指示办事，一心一意地做一辈子毛主席的好学生。
