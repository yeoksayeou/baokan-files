Li Da, this anti-party and anti-socialist element, is also a landlord who escaped punishment. Li Da's father, Li Fu Ren, owned about one hundred mu of paddy fields and thirty-eight rooms, making him a major landlord in Lingling, Hunan. He served as the head of the local puppet militia for over ten years, consistently oppressing the people, exploiting the poor, colluding with landlord officials, and acting tyrannically.

Li Da inherited his father's legacy and went even further, consistently oppressing and exploiting peasants, living a debauched and shameless life. Recently, local peasants have exposed Li Da's numerous crimes of exploitation and oppression.

1. Hiring workers to open shops. As early as around 1915, Li Da opened a pharmacy in Cai Jia Pu, hiring more than two workers. During the War of Resistance, Li Da also opened various shops in Chujiang Yu, Cai Jia Pu, and Guilin, Guangxi, each hiring more than two workers. In 1944, he hired two or three workers to open a liquor store. Additionally, he hired workers for timber rafting and cotton cloth businesses.

2. Hiring workers to farm. Before liberation, Li Da hired at least one long-term worker and several short-term workers each year. In 1948, Li Da hired five workers to help him farm orchards and watermelons for sale.

3. Leasing land. In 1947, Li Da owned sixteen mu of paddy fields, all of which were leased out through his nephew Li Ding Xiang, collecting about one dan of rice per mu as rent.

4. Usury. For example, Li Yong Gui borrowed three dan of rice from Li Da in 1948 with an interest rate of eight percent, and within half a month, he had to repay five dan and four dou of rice. Another example is the poor peasant Tang Jian Bao, who borrowed two dan of rice from Li Da and, after a few months, had to repay a total of six dan of rice, including interest.

5. Molesting women. Li Da bought two girls from poor families to be his maids. One woman with the surname Li worked for Li Da for over ten years and was later taken as his concubine, but a few years later, she was driven out of the house.

6. Extortion. In 1943, Li Da sent the seven-year-old daughter of Li Ding Ren to a major landlord, Zhang Wen Lin, as a maid. Later, Li Ding Ren was extorted by Li Da for three dan and six dou of rice before he could take his daughter back. In the same year, Li Wu Xiang followed Li Da to hide from the Japanese invaders. Li Da gave his two-year-old sister to someone else and had his older sister work for Li Da. Later, Li Da extorted five dan and five dou of rice from him, claiming to have raised his brother.

7. Forced labor for construction. Li Da built four houses, using local villagers as laborers, who were not paid for their work. The peasants said: working for Li Da is unpaid labor.

8. Debauchery and gambling. Li Da had one wife and four concubines, consistently gambling and playing cards, taking bets, demanding payment, and using hooligan tactics.

9. Sabotaging land reform. In 1948, Li Da saw that the Kuomintang reactionaries were about to collapse, so he quickly sold his land, dispersed his property, and escaped the peasants' settlement. He also instructed three nearby landlords, Tang Bao Xuan, Tang Jin Zhao, and Tang Sheng Xian, to sell their land. For example, the landlord Tang Sheng Xian sold more than seventy mu out of over one hundred mu of land, and during the land reform, he was only classified as a bankrupt landlord.

10. Shielding landlords. During the land reform, Li Da wrote to the township government saying, "Li Song Ling does not meet the criteria for being classified as a landlord," shielding this landlord from scrutiny. Li Da also instigated his student, the landlord Hu Di Yuan, to flee immediately and introduced him to a position as the head of the finance department.

    李达剥削农民的十大罪恶
    李达这个反党反社会主义分子，还是一个漏网的地主分子。李达的父亲李甫仁，家有水田一百亩左右，房屋三十八间，是湖南零陵的大豪绅，当过当地伪团总十余年，一贯欺压人民，剥削穷人，勾结地主官僚，作威作福。
    李达接过他父亲的衣钵，变本加厉，一贯欺压和剥削农民，过着荒淫无耻的生活。最近，当地广大农民揭发了李达剥削、压迫农民的大量罪恶。
    一、雇工开店。早在一九一五年前后，李达在当地的蔡家埠开药店，雇工两人以上。抗战时期，李达又在楚江圩、蔡家埠、广西桂林等地开过杂货店，每店雇工两人以上。一九四四年还雇工二、三人开过酒店。此外还雇工做木排生意、纱布生意。
    二、雇工种田。李达在解放前，每年雇长工一人以上，短工数人。一九四八年李达又雇工五人，帮他种果园、种西瓜等出卖。
    三、出租土地。一九四七年，李达有水田十六亩，全部通过他的侄儿李定香出租，每亩收租谷一担左右。
    四、高利盘剥。如李永贵，一九四八年以加八的利息向李达借谷三担，不到半个月，就要还谷五担四斗。还有贫农唐建豹向李达借谷两担，过了几个月连本带息共还谷六担。
    五、蹂躏妇女。李达先后买了两个穷人的女孩做丫头。一个李姓妇女，替李达做工十多年，以后被李达占为小老婆，但不几年又将她赶出门外。
    六、敲诈勒索。一九四三年李达将李定仁七岁的二女送给大地主张文林当丫头，后来李定仁被李达勒索稻谷三担六斗，才将二女领回。同年，李五香随李达躲日寇，李达将他二岁的妹妹送给别人，叫他的姐姐给李达做事，以后李达反而借口说养活了他的弟弟，勒索稻谷五担五斗。
    七、拉工砌屋。李达先后砌屋四栋，杂工、小工，都是本村人做的，做了又不给钱。农民说：给李达做的是白工。
    八、吃喝嫖赌，荒淫无耻。李达讨过一妻四妾，一贯赌钱打牌，伙赌抽头，输打赢要，耍流氓手段。
    九、破坏土改。一九四八年，李达看见国民党反动派快要垮台了，赶快卖田，分散财产，逃脱农民对他的清算。他还指使附近三个地主唐保轩、唐金照、唐升显大肆卖田。如地主分子唐升显，把一百多亩田卖掉了七十多亩，土改时只被划为破产地主。
    十、包庇地主。土改时，李达向乡政府写信说：“李松岭不符合划地主的条件。”包庇这个地主分子逃过了关。李达还唆使他的学生、地主胡迪源马上逃走，并介绍他到某处当财务科长。
