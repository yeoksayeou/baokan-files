In 1958, with the Party's cultivation and the help of comrades, I, along with many other workers, peasants, and soldiers, enthusiastically studied Chairman Mao's works. Soon, the Communist Party of China's Huanggang Sub-bureau organized a philosophy lecture team, and I joined this team. We went to Wuhan and, at the invitation of the revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan University, I shared my experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works there. The revolutionary teachers and students of Wuhan University warmly supported and encouraged me to study Chairman Mao's works even better. However, the anti-party, anti-socialist bourgeois reactionary academic "authority" Li Da cursed, "A fourteen-year-old Mao girl lecturing on philosophy, this is a mockery of the prestigious Wuhan University, a big joke." He said I couldn't distinguish between spirit and matter, "how could I lecture on philosophy?"

Li Da was referring to me, Ding Fengying, but he was not cursing me as an individual. He was cursing our broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. On one hand, in Li Da's eyes, philosophy is mysterious and profound, only a few "superior people" can master it. The masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are "rough and uneducated," "inferior people," without culture, how could they study philosophy? On the other hand, he fiercely opposed us workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works, opposed us mastering Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, he used all means, maliciously, to curse us. This is the usual trick of all counter-revolutionaries, determined by their reactionary class nature.

Chairman Mao pointed out: Let philosophy be liberated from the classrooms and books of philosophers, and become a sharp weapon in the hands of the masses. He also said: Marxism is developed in struggle. Great Mao Zedong Thought is developed in the revolutionary struggles of our country and the world's people. The workers, peasants, and soldiers standing at the forefront of the revolutionary struggle are the ones who best understand the principles of revolutionary struggle and can best learn the principles of revolutionary struggle. Once the workers, peasants, and soldiers master Mao Zedong Thought, they become smarter and more combative, and can stand firm in the face of great storms. From the situation of our brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, it can be fully seen that we workers, peasants, and soldiers can study philosophy, lecture on philosophy, and use philosophy. Li Da and other bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" saying that we workers, peasants, and soldiers cannot study philosophy is completely a shameless slander.

Our brigade planted more than six hundred mu of wheat, and the crops were growing well. This spring, it seemed that a bumper harvest was in sight. Just as everyone was happy, suddenly a heavy snow fell, and half of the wheat was lost. At that time, many people felt the difficulties were great, and my heart was anxious like a fire burning. At this critical moment, we organized all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the brigade to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao taught us: "Our comrades must see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." When discussing this passage, everyone said that Chairman Mao was like standing by our side, and he spoke to our hearts. Everyone linked their thoughts to the discussion, realizing that if they could not see the light in the face of difficulties, it was a metaphysical view, it was to see the problem as dead, it was not to understand the dialectical law of one dividing into two. What is the light? It is the favorable conditions, first of all, it is the people, it is the masses. Through the discussion, everyone's spirit was invigorated, and their confidence in overcoming difficulties greatly increased. This is not exactly the proof that we can learn Marxist philosophy and use Marxist philosophy?

Such learning made us deeply understand that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, the red sun in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. If we do not study Chairman Mao's works, we will lose our soul and lose our direction. If we study Chairman Mao's works, we will have a clear mind and bright eyes, and we will have a telescope and microscope for revolution, and we will definitely achieve great victories. Precisely because we, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, deeply feel in production struggles, class struggles, and scientific experiments that "sailing the great sea relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought," we will study Mao Zedong Thought whenever we encounter problems, and we will be able to solve problems by studying Mao Zedong Thought. The era of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering theory has indeed arrived.

Li Da fiercely opposes us studying Mao Zedong Thought, wanting to use his black claws to tear away our lifeline, not letting us rise up to thoroughly smash the old world and build a new world. Li Da is so crazy, we are not afraid! We have mastered Mao Zedong Thought, not to mention one Li Da, even a thousand Li Das, ten thousand Li Das, are nothing to us! Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. Li Da opposes us studying Mao Zedong Thought, which even more shows that we are right. The more Li Da opposes, the more we must worship and revere Mao Zedong Thought without limit, and the more we must study it better. We must firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and overthrow all bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the world!

### 把反动哲学“权威”打翻在地

    把反动哲学“权威”打翻在地
    全国青年学习毛主席著作积极分子湖北罗田县北丰公社四大队党支部书记  丁凤英
    一九五八年，在党的培养和同志们的帮助下，我和许多工农兵同志一样，满腔热情地学习毛主席著作。不久，中共黄冈地委组织了哲学讲演团，我参加了这个讲演团，来到武汉，应武汉大学革命师生的邀请，在他们那里讲了我学习毛主席著作的心得。武汉大学革命师生热烈地支持我、鼓励我把毛主席著作学得更好。可是，反党反社会主义的资产阶级反动学术“权威”李达却破口大骂：“十四岁的毛丫头讲哲学，这是对堂堂武大的一个讽刺，是一个大笑话。”说我搞不清精神和物质，“哪能讲哲学？”
    李达指的是我丁凤英的名，但骂的却不是我个人。他骂的是我们广大工农兵。一方面，在李达看来，哲学是神秘的、深奥的，只有少数“上等人”才能掌握。工农兵群众是“大老粗”，“下等人”，没有文化，哪里配学哲学？另一方面，他疯狂地反对我们工农兵学习毛主席著作，反对我们掌握毛泽东思想。因而不择手段地、恶毒地谩骂我们。这是一切反革命分子的惯技，是它们反动的阶级本质所决定的。
    毛主席指出：让哲学从哲学家的课堂上和书本里解放出来，变为群众手里的尖锐武器。又说：马克思主义是在斗争中发展起来的。伟大的毛泽东思想就是在我国和世界人民的革命斗争中发展起来的。站在革命斗争最前线的工农兵群众就是最能懂得革命斗争的道理，最能学好革命斗争的道理。工农兵一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得更聪明、更富有战斗性，就能够在大风大浪中站稳脚跟。从我们大队贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作的情况来看，也可以充分说明我们工农兵能够学哲学、讲哲学、用哲学。李达等资产阶级反动学术“权威”说我们工农兵不能学哲学，完全是无耻的诬蔑。
    我们大队种了六百多亩麦子，庄稼一直长得很好，今春眼看丰收在望。正当大家高兴的时候，突然下了一场大雪，麦子损失了一半。当时，许多人感到困难不小，我的心里也焦急得像火烧。在这关键时刻，我们组织全队贫下中农学习《为人民服务》。毛主席教导我们说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”讨论这条语录时，大家说，毛主席就好像是站在我们身边，他老人家把话说到我们的心坎上来了。大家联系自己的活思想，体会到，在困难面前如果看不到光明，就是形而上学的观点，就是把问题看死了，就是不懂得一分为二的辩证法。光明是什么呢？就是有利条件，首先就是人，就是群众。通过讨论，大家精神振奋，战胜困难的信心大大增加。这不正说明了我们能学马克思主义哲学、能用马克思主义哲学吗？
    这样的学习，使我们深深懂得，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是贫下中农心中的红太阳。我们不学习毛主席著作，就失掉了灵魂，迷失了方向。学习了毛主席著作，就心里明，眼睛亮，干革命就有了望远镜和显微镜，就一定能够取得伟大胜利。正因为我们广大工农兵群众，在生产斗争、阶级斗争、科学实验中深切体会到“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想”的道理，我们才一碰到问题就要学毛泽东思想，一学毛泽东思想就能解决问题。广大工农兵群众掌握理论的时代确实是已经来到了。
    李达疯狂地反对我们学习毛泽东思想，就是要用他们的黑爪子抓掉我们的命根子，不让我们起来彻底摧毁旧世界，建设新世界。李达这样疯狂，我们不怕！我们掌握了毛泽东思想，不要说一个李达，就是一千个李达，一万个李达，也都不在话下！被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。李达反对我们学习毛泽东思想，就更加说明我们做对了。李达越是反对，我们就越是要对毛泽东思想无限崇拜，无限敬仰，越是要更好地学。我们要紧紧掌握毛泽东思想这一锐利武器，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，把一切资产阶级反动学术“权威”统统打翻在地，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远高高地在全世界飘扬！
