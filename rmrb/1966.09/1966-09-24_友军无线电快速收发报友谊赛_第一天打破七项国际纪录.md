Inside the competition venue, a portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people, was prominently displayed. Banners on either side read: "Firmly carry the struggle against modern revisionism to the end!" and "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world!" Around the venue, Chairman Mao's quotations about imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers and firmly supporting the struggle of the people of South Vietnam were posted.

Yesterday's competition included eight events: men's and women's manual Morse code telegraphy, manual numeric telegraphy, automatic Morse code telegraphy, and automatic numeric telegraphy. Except for the women's manual Morse code telegraphy event, the international records for the remaining seven events were all broken.
