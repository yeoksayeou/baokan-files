On the morning of the 24th, more than two thousand Red Guards were rehearsing a mass chorus to be performed for Japanese friends at the Second China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Rally. The song, full of fighting camaraderie, was titled "China-Japan Youth United in Struggle." They were ready to welcome the victorious Japanese youth friends who would soon arrive in China.

Suddenly, news came that the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, currently visiting Beijing, had accepted the Red Guards' invitation and would soon come to meet everyone.

"Welcome Japanese friends!" The hall instantly buzzed with excitement. Many Red Guards once again reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Apart from the monopolistic capital and militarist clique in Japan that are pro-American, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." "All countries that are subjected to American aggression, control, interference, and bullying should unite to form the broadest possible united front, oppose the policy of aggression and war of American imperialism, and defend world peace."

At noon, led by Seisuke Shimizu, the entire Matsuyama Ballet Troupe arrived at the rehearsal hall. More than two thousand Red Guards stood up in unison, holding high red-covered copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and spontaneously sang the Japanese fighting song "Give Back Okinawa."

A Red Guard representative stepped onto the stage to express the warmest welcome to the guests. He said, "The U.S. imperialists, the Japanese Sato government, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various new and old followers are doing everything they can to sabotage the Second China-Japan Youth Friendship Grand Rally. We will not allow this. We strongly demand that the Sato government immediately revoke its unreasonable decision to refuse passports to Japanese youth coming to China to participate in the rally."

The representative's speech and the strong atmosphere of unity and struggle in the rehearsal hall deeply moved Seisuke Shimizu. Seisuke Shimizu stepped forward to speak, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists, revisionists, and the Japanese Sato government for obstructing Japanese youth from coming to China for the rally. He said passionately, "The sun is Chairman Mao. Let the Red Guards and the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe unite under Chairman Mao's guidance!"

After Seisuke Shimizu's speech, he called all the troupe members to the stage and together they sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" in Chinese. At this moment, more than two thousand Red Guards also joined in singing with the Japanese friends. The song strongly expressed the boundless love, faith, and respect of the peoples of China and Japan for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Next, the Red Guard soldiers performed the mass chorus they had rehearsed for several weeks for the Japanese friends. Finally, the friends from China and Japan stood up together and sang the international anthem of the proletariat, "The Internationale." As the song ended, everyone shouted in unison: "Long live the fighting friendship between Chinese and Japanese youth! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Chairman Mao's brilliance shines upon us! The friendship between the peoples of China and Japan is indestructible. Let the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs tremble before our great fighting unity!

    毛主席的光辉照耀着我们
    ——记首都红卫兵和日本松山芭蕾舞团朋友的会见
    “越过重洋穿过海，
    中日青年团结起来！
    肩并肩，手挽手，
    汇成反帝大洪流……。”
    二十四日上午，准备在第二届中日青年友好大联欢时为日本朋友表演大合唱的两千多红卫兵小将，正在加紧排练着这支充满战斗友情的歌曲——《中日青年团结战斗之歌》。他们准备随时欢迎胜利冲破障碍的日本青年朋友，来到中国。
    排练大厅突然传来一个消息：正在北京访问的日本松山芭蕾舞团接受了红卫兵的邀请，一会儿要来同大家会见。
    “欢迎日本朋友！”大厅里顿时沸腾起来。许多红卫兵，又一次重温起毛主席的教导：“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友。”“……所有受到美国侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家要联合起来，结成最广泛的统一战线，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平。”中午时分，以清水正夫为首的日本松山芭蕾舞团全体成员，来到了排练大厅。两千多红卫兵“唰”地一声站了起来，高举红色封面的《毛主席语录》，并且情不自禁地唱起了日本战斗歌曲《还我冲绳》。
    一个红卫兵代表走上讲台，向客人们表示了最热烈的欢迎。他说：“美帝国主义、日本佐藤政府、苏联现代修正主义，还有他们的形形色色的新旧追随者，千方百计破坏第二届中日青年友好大联欢。我们坚决不答应，我们强烈要求佐藤政府立即撤销拒发来中国参加联欢的日本青年护照的无理决定。”
    红卫兵代表的讲话，排练大厅团结战斗的强烈气氛，使清水正夫团长深受感动。清水正夫走向台前讲话，他强烈谴责美帝国主义、修正主义和日本佐藤政府阻挠日本青年来中国联欢。他满怀激情地说：“太阳就是毛主席，让毛主席的红卫兵和松山芭蕾舞团，按照毛主席的指示团结在一起！”
    清水正夫团长讲话以后，他把代表团全体团员召到台前，和他们一起用中文高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。这时，两千多红卫兵也同日本朋友一起唱了起来。歌声强烈地表达了中日两国人民对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇敬的感情。
    接着，红卫兵战士们为日本朋友表演了他们排练了几个星期的大合唱节目。最后中日两国朋友全体起立合唱全世界无产阶级的战歌《国际歌》。歌声一停，大家又一齐高呼：“中日青年战斗友谊万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    毛主席的光辉照耀着我们！中日两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的，让美帝国主义和他们的走狗在我们伟大的战斗团结面前发抖吧！·新华社记者·
