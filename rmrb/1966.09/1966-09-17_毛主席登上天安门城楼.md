Chairman Mao ascends Tiananmen Gate, the sky is red and the earth is red; Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses are heart to heart, Chairman Mao waves and smiles at the revolutionary masses. Tiananmen Square becomes an ocean of joy, millions of excited eyes flow with tears, thousands of songs and ten thousand words, turn into cheers pouring out: Long live Chairman Mao! Our great leader, long live Chairman Mao! Our great teacher, great helmsman, great commander! With beloved Chairman Mao leading, we fear no hardships, we bravely fight. With Mao Zedong Thought illuminating the way, our revolutionary steps will never halt. Chairman Mao! We pledge to you: Your teachings we will always remember, we will model ourselves after and carry out the Sixteen Points, and achieve greater victories in the cultural revolution!...

Chairman Mao ascends Tiananmen Gate, all reactionaries tremble with fear; Chairman Mao once again receives revolutionary students and teachers, another thunderous roar, echoing across the four seas and five continents!
