Since the implementation of the decision of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission in 1960, our company has continuously advanced in the movement to study Chairman Mao's works. From the initial "one viewpoint, three combinations" (combining thought, combining tasks, combining the situation) to "learn a bit, apply a bit, understand a bit, summarize a bit," and then to the later "small rectification," these are all methods derived from the fundamental principle of "learn and apply" proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. Chairman Mao said: "If there is a correct theory, but it is only talked about and not put into practice, then no matter how good the theory is, it is meaningless." The principle of "learn and apply" proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao is the fundamental way for us to grasp Mao Zedong Thought, opening up a broad path for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to grasp Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great innovation. This innovation has opened up a new era for workers, peasants, and soldiers to become the masters of theory, and its significance for the entire proletarian revolutionary cause is very profound.

Our company has relied on learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to continuously strengthen political work and various constructions, and has been rated as a model company for five consecutive years. Over the years, the soldiers in our company, whether they are young workers, peasants, or intellectuals, regardless of their cultural background, have quickly grown into red successors. They are good soldiers and good cadres in the army, and they are "red seeds" when they go to the local areas. The process of growth of these comrades is the process of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. The facts fully prove that only by insisting on learning and applying, and working hard on the "apply" aspect, can Mao Zedong Thought be truly mastered.

    活学活用才能把毛泽东思想学到手
    指导员　王银泽
    自从一九六○年贯彻执行军委扩大会议决议以来，我们连队学习毛主席著作的运动不断向前发展。由起初的“一个观点三结合”（结合思想、结合任务、结合形势）到“学一点、用一点、透一点、总结一点”，一直到后来的“小整风”，这都是从林彪副主席提出的活学活用这一根本原则产生出来的方法。毛主席说：“如果有了正确的理论，只是把它空谈一阵，束之高阁，并不实行，那末，这种理论再好也是没有意义的。”林彪副主席提出的活学活用的原则，是我们掌握毛泽东思想的根本途径，为我们广大工农兵掌握毛泽东思想开辟了一条广阔的道路，这是一个伟大的创举。这个创举，开辟了工农兵做理论的主人的崭新时代，对于整个无产阶级革命事业来说，意义是非常深远的。
    我们连就是这样靠活学活用毛主席著作，不断加强政治工作建设和各项建设，连续五年都被评为五好连队的。几年来，我们连的战士，不论是工农青年还是知识青年，不论文化高低，都迅速成长为红色接班人。他们在部队是好战士、好干部，到地方就是“红色种子”。这些同志成长的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作的过程。事实充分证明：只有坚持活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫，才能把毛泽东思想真正学到手。
