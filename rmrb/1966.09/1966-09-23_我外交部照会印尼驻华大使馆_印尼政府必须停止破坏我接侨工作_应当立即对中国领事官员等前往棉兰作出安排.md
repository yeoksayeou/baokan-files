China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on September 22. The note expresses deep regret over the Indonesian government's unreasonable rejection of China's five reasonable demands regarding the dispatch of ships to bring back overseas Chinese, as proposed in the September 5 note. The note also points out that the Indonesian government should immediately make arrangements for Chinese consular officials and necessary personnel to go to Medan to ensure the smooth progress of the repatriation work.

The note states, "On September 21, the Deputy Director of the Asia-Pacific Division of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy, stating that the Indonesian government rejects the five reasonable demands proposed by the Chinese government in the September 5 note regarding the dispatch of ships to bring back overseas Chinese who wish to return to their homeland. The Indonesian government threatened to continue persecuting overseas Chinese who have been forced to Medan and threatened to harass and restrict Chinese ships. This is a gross interference with China's work of dispatching ships to bring back overseas Chinese who wish to return to their homeland. The Chinese government expresses deep regret over this."

The note states, "The five demands proposed by the Chinese government are completely legitimate and necessary. The large number of overseas Chinese who have been harmed and wish to return to their homeland is the result of the Indonesian government's vigorous promotion of anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese policies. This is completely different from the normal situation of overseas Chinese leaving the country to return to their homeland. The Indonesian government is fully responsible for taking necessary measures to ensure the smooth departure and return of the overseas Chinese who have been harmed. Currently, the overseas Chinese who have been persecuted by the authorities of Aceh and forced to Medan are in a very difficult situation. They eagerly await the arrival of Chinese consular officials and Chinese repatriation ships to arrange and transport them back to their homeland. The repatriation ships specially dispatched by the Chinese government have arrived near the port of Wira Bay, Indonesia, on September 22. However, the Indonesian government not only refuses to allow Chinese consular officials to go to Medan to take care of the ships and arrange for the overseas Chinese who have been harmed to return to their homeland, but also refuses to provide security guarantees for Chinese ships. Therefore, the Chinese ships can only anchor in the international waters near Medan, causing the repatriation ships to change their original navigation plan and be forced to temporarily delay entering the port of Wira Bay. The artificial difficulties faced by the repatriation work are entirely the result of the Indonesian government's actions."

The note emphasizes, "If the Indonesian government still adheres to the basic norms of international relations, it should immediately make arrangements for Chinese consular officials and necessary personnel to go to Medan to ensure the smooth progress of the repatriation work. Otherwise, all responsibilities must be borne by the Indonesian government."

    我外交部照会印尼驻华大使馆
    印尼政府必须停止破坏我接侨工作
    应当立即对中国领事官员等前往棉兰作出安排
    新华社二十二日讯  中华人民共和国外交部二十二日给印度尼西亚驻华大使馆一份照会，对印度尼西亚政府无理拒绝中国政府九月五日照会中提出的关于派船接回华侨的五项合理要求，粗暴破坏中国派船接侨工作表示极大的遗憾，并指出印度尼西亚政府应当立即对中国领事官员和必要的工作人员前往棉兰作出安排，以便接侨工作顺利进行。
    照会说，“九月二十一日，印度尼西亚外交部亚洲太平洋司副司长答复中国大使馆临时代办，印度尼西亚政府拒绝中国政府在九月五日照会中就中国派船接回自愿返回祖国的华侨问题提出的五项合理要求，威胁要继续迫害被赶到棉兰的华侨，威胁要对中国船只进行刁难和限制。这是印度尼西亚政府对中国派船接回自愿回国华侨工作的粗暴破坏。对此，中国政府表示极大的遗憾。”
    照会说，“中国政府提出的五项要求是完全正当的和必要的。大批受害华侨要求回国是印度尼西亚政府大力推行反华排华政策的结果，这与正常情况下外侨离境回国完全不同。印度尼西亚政府完全有责任采取必要的措施，保证受害华侨顺利离境回国。现在，被印度尼西亚亚齐当局迫害而到棉兰的受害华侨，处境极为困难。他们渴望中国领事官员和中国接侨船只的到达，安排和接运他们回国。中国政府专门派出的接侨船只已于九月二十二日到达印度尼西亚勿拉湾港口附近。可是，印度尼西亚政府既拒绝中国领事官员前往棉兰照料船只和安排受害华侨回国，又拒绝对中国船只的安全提供保证。中国船只因而只好停泊在棉兰附近的公海海面上，致使接侨船只被迫改变原定航行计划，不得不暂缓进入勿拉湾港口。接侨工作面临的这种人为的困难，完全是印度尼西亚政府一手造成的。”
    照会强调指出，“如果印度尼西亚政府还遵守起码的国际关系准则，就应当立即对中国领事官员和必要的工作人员前往棉兰作出安排，以便接侨工作顺利进行。否则，一切责任必须由印度尼西亚政府承担。”
