In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Tibetan students and workers and peasants in the Xining area have eagerly obtained the Tibetan version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and individual volumes of Chairman Mao's works.

Whenever the New China Bookstore's bookmobile arrives at schools, factories, and communes, the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups there beat drums, set off firecrackers, and hold grand welcoming and celebratory events. On August 30, the New China Bookstore braved the rain to deliver books to Qinghai Nationality Middle School. Over 300 revolutionary students, dressed in vibrant ethnic attire, came out to welcome them, singing and shouting with joy. Subsequently, the school held a grand ceremony to distribute "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The students performed many self-composed, exciting programs, enthusiastically praising our beloved leader Chairman Mao and the great Communist Party of China.

Tibetan student Rolajie from the Normal Class held the Tibetan version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to his chest, tears of excitement in his eyes, and said, "Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! We are the little sprouts nurtured by your sunshine and rain. I have a thousand words, ten thousand words, but I cannot express my boundless love for you. I will shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, on August 28, the New China Bookstore in Hohhot issued the Mongolian version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" for the first time and continued to issue "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

That afternoon, the New China Bookstore building was newly decorated. A giant portrait of Chairman Mao stood tall above the entrance, and red flags fluttered in the wind in front of the building. As the booksellers handed out the books to the readers, firecrackers exploded, and drums and gongs resounded. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and revolutionary songs such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" echoed through the sky.

The ethnic Red Guards, holding "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and the Mongolian version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," were spirited and enthusiastic. They excitedly said, "Chairman Mao is the supreme commander of the Red Guards. The Red Guards will take Chairman Mao's instructions as the guiding principle for all actions and resolutely carry them out; resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, thoroughly smash the 'Four Olds' and establish the 'Four News,' sweep away all ghosts and monsters, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."
