The broad masses of cadres and community members in the rural areas of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces are currently working tirelessly to harvest autumn crops, striving to seize the agricultural season and secure the bountiful harvest.

This year, the people of Northeast China have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, combining revolution with production, overcoming drought and pests, and achieving an excellent harvest across the entire Northeast region. This marks the fourth consecutive year of bumper harvests following the past three years. To ensure a successful autumn harvest, various levels of party and government leadership have paid great attention to the work, treating it as the most important task at hand. Provinces and prefectures have established two teams, one for the Cultural Revolution and one for autumn production, aiming for victories in both revolution and production. County-level party and government departments have recently dispatched cadres to people's communes and production teams to participate in and lead the autumn harvest. Red Guards from major cities and leaders at various levels have also flocked to the countryside, joining the front lines of autumn production to harvest autumn crops together with the masses.

According to a report from Urumqi on the 26th, the various ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, combining revolution with production, and achieved another bumper harvest in agriculture this year. This is Xinjiang's fifth consecutive year of bumper harvests.

Since early September, corn, rice, and sorghum have been harvested across Xinjiang. From the Ili Valley to the foothills of the Karakoram Mountains, a scene of bumper harvests is everywhere. Judging from the harvesting situation of various crops, Xinjiang not only increased grain production this year but also had better yields of cotton and oilseeds compared to last year. The autonomous region's full-year agricultural production has achieved an all-around bumper harvest, which is the result of various ethnic cadres and community members studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, combining revolution with production. The community members say, "With Chairman Mao's works in our arms, we have boundless strength."

According to a report from Guangzhou, in the first eight months of this year, the procurement of agricultural and sideline products in Guangdong has shown a very good situation, with the total procurement amount significantly increasing compared to the same period last year. Some major products have already completed or are close to completing the full-year procurement plan ahead of schedule.

Currently, out of the seventeen major agricultural and sideline products in the province, coconut, pineapple, bamboo, and reed have already completed the full-year procurement plan ahead of schedule and in excess. Yellow hemp, banana, rush mat, straw mat, Jiangbai vine, and paper have completed more than 70% of the plan. The procurement season for bananas and yellow hemp has just begun, with the procurement volume increasing several times compared to last year. The procurement volume of live pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese for urban residents has also significantly increased.

According to a report from Zhengzhou, Henan has significantly increased cotton production this year. The broad masses of cotton farmers, with unprecedented political enthusiasm, are actively selling new cotton to the state. By September 20, the province had procured cotton, which increased by 1.3 times compared to the same period last year. The new cotton has a higher lint percentage, longer fiber, and fewer impurities, with the grade generally improved by one or two levels compared to the past.

The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has ignited the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of cotton farmers in Henan. Many cotton-producing people's communes and production teams have formed "Patriotic Cotton Selling Teams" to concentrate on selling cotton to the state. In many places, a mass cotton-selling frenzy has emerged since the beginning of procurement.

The broad masses of community members in Lijiazhuang Brigade, Chengguan Commune, Linqu County, Shandong Province, have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, displayed great revolutionary spirit, overcome drought and dry land, and achieved a good autumn harvest.

    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，激发了河南省广大棉农高昂的革命热情，许多棉区人民公社、生产队，纷纷组成“爱国售棉队”，集中地向国家交售棉花，不少地方在收购一开始就出现了群众性的售棉热潮。（附图片）
