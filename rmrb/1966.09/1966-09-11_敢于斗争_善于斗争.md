The philosophy of the proletariat is a philosophy of struggle.

Marx said: “Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.”

Dialectical materialism is combative, revolutionary, and critical.

From the perspective of dialectical materialism, whether it is nature, human society, or human thought, all are filled with the unity and struggle of contradictions. Unity is conditional, temporary, and relative, while struggle is absolute. The struggle of contradictions is the driving force for the development of all things.

The history of civilization over the past few thousand years is a history of class struggle. Class struggle has driven the development of history. The viewpoint of class struggle is the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism.

Chairman Mao said: “The essence of Marxism is summed up in one sentence: ‘Rebellion is justified.’ … Based on this principle, we rebel, we struggle, we build socialism.” Before the proletariat seizes power, it must rebel against the exploiting classes; otherwise, it cannot establish proletarian dictatorship. After the proletariat seizes power, it must still rebel against the exploiting classes, especially against the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of all exploiting classes; otherwise, proletarian dictatorship will not only fail to consolidate but also risks degenerating into bourgeois dictatorship.

Our Red Guards and the broad masses of revolutionaries, following Chairman Mao’s teachings, have grasped the weapon of proletarian struggle philosophy. They are rebelling against all exploiting classes.

To rebel, one must first be bold. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards and the revolutionary masses dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to struggle, and dare to criticize. They dare to break all old frameworks and foreign dogmas, and wage uncompromising struggles against those in power who are taking the capitalist road, against bourgeois reactionary “authorities,” and against all monsters and demons. They have shown the great revolutionary spirit of the proletariat.

The Red Guards and the revolutionary masses, with the spirit of daring, have written countless big-character posters and revolutionary proposals. These are filled with proletarian revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary fighting spirit. They smash the “Four Olds” and establish the “Four News,” striking against all the filth left behind by the old world and sweeping away all monsters and demons. Their writing is so powerful, their pen so sharp, and some of their works are brilliant poems, shining with the radiant light of dialectics.

The Red Guards and the revolutionary teachers and students have gone from the schools to the streets, making the struggle in the cultural realm extend to politics and economics. They have developed the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools to the struggle, criticism, and transformation in society, forming a magnificent revolutionary torrent. In a short time, with the force of a landslide and the power of thunder, they have swept away the old and achieved brilliant victories. They have greatly diminished the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat. Their revolutionary actions are excellent!

To dare to struggle, one must also be good at struggling. The Red Guards and the revolutionary masses are determined to learn swimming while swimming and to learn struggling while struggling. In the Cultural Revolution, they strive to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, focusing on the “use” of his teachings. They follow Chairman Mao’s instructions, treating the party’s policies as the party’s lifeblood, seriously studying the “Sixteen Points,” and strictly implementing them. In their struggles, they firmly execute an important policy of the Cultural Revolution: to use struggle through words, not through violence. They fully utilize big-character posters, engage in great debates, speak out, and criticize in writing, thoroughly exposing the crimes of all monsters and demons and conducting deep criticism, overthrowing, defeating, and disgracing them! The Red Guards and other revolutionary organizations, taking the People’s Liberation Army as their example, aim to build a combat-ready force with high political awareness and strong organizational discipline. They execute the three main disciplines and eight points for attention, protect the interests of the masses, and safeguard state property. In their struggles, the Red Guards and the revolutionary masses learn the strategies of struggle, use class analysis methods, distinguish between enemies and friends, clarify right and wrong, unite with the majority, and concentrate their efforts on striking down a handful of rightist elements of the bourgeoisie.

Those bourgeois gentlemen, who distort right and wrong, confuse truth and falsehood, spread rumors, and shoot arrows in the dark, say that the revolutionary youth are “arrogant,” “naive,” and “rude,” and that their actions are “terrible”! Some political mediocrities and fools also follow in their footsteps, looking worried, with endless concerns, chattering endlessly. In fact, all these things do not harm the revolutionary youth in the slightest and do not shake their red hearts in the least.

In the eyes of the revolutionary proletariat, the words and actions of the Red Guards and the revolutionary masses are not “terrible” but are excellent! In this Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards and the revolutionary masses have grasped the spirit of daring and the spirit of being good at struggling, becoming brave and wise pioneers, daring to smash the “Four Olds” and daring to create the “Four News”; being good at smashing the “Four Olds” and being good at creating the “Four News.” The philosophy of proletarian struggle is our sharp weapon for carrying out revolutionary struggles. Only by struggling against class enemies and natural enemies can the socialist revolution be victorious, and socialist construction advance! Struggle, advance, struggle again, advance again … this is our philosophy.

    敢于斗争  善于斗争

    无产阶级的哲学是斗争的哲学。
    马克思说：“哲学家们只是用不同的方式解释世界，问题在于改变世界。”
    唯物辩证法是战斗的，革命的，批判的。
    按照唯物辩证法的观点看来，不论是自然界、人类社会和人的思想，都充满了矛盾的统一和斗争。统一是有条件的、暂时的、相对的，而斗争则是绝对的。矛盾的斗争是一切事物发展的动力。
    几千年来的文明史，就是一部阶级斗争史。阶级斗争推动了历史的发展。阶级斗争的观点，是马克思列宁主义的根本观点。
    毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”无产阶级在夺取政权以前，要造剥削阶级的反；否则，就不能建立无产阶级专政。无产阶级夺取政权以后，还要造剥削阶级的反，特别是要造一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的反；否则，无产阶级专政不仅不能巩固，而且有蜕化为资产阶级专政的危险。
    我们的红卫兵和广大的革命群众，就是按照毛主席的教导，掌握了无产阶级斗争的哲学这个武器，大造一切剥削阶级的反。
    要造反，首先要“敢”字当头。红卫兵和革命群众，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢斗争、敢批判，敢于打破各种旧框框、洋教条，向走资本主义道路的当权派，向资产阶级反动“权威”，向一切牛鬼蛇神作无情的斗争，表现出无产阶级大无畏的革命精神。
    红卫兵和革命群众“敢”字当头，写出的千千万万张大字报，千千万万篇革命的倡议书，洋溢着无产阶级的革命豪情，充满了革命的战斗精神，大破“四旧”，大立“四新”，向旧世界遗留下来的一切污泥浊水冲击，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。他们的笔力是多么雄健，文锋是多么犀利，有些是天才的壮丽诗篇，放射着辩证法的灿烂光芒。
    红卫兵和广大革命师生们从学校走向街头，使文化领域的斗争触及到政治和经济，把学校中的斗、批、改，发展到社会上的斗、批、改，形成了波澜壮阔的革命洪流。在很短的时间内，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，摧枯拉朽，风卷残云，获得了辉煌的战果。大灭资产阶级的威风，大长无产阶级的志气。他们的革命行动好得很！
    要敢于斗争，还要善于斗争。红卫兵和革命群众决心在游泳中学会游泳，在斗争中学会斗争。他们在文化大革命中努力活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫。他们遵照毛主席的教导，把党的政策看做是党的生命，认真地学习十六条，不折不扣地贯彻执行十六条。他们在斗争中，坚决执行文化大革命中的一项重要政策：用文斗，不用武斗。充分利用大字报，进行大辩论，大鸣大放，口诛笔伐，把一切牛鬼蛇神的罪恶彻底揭露出来，进行深刻批判，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！红卫兵和其他革命组织以解放军为榜样，要建立一支有高度政治觉悟、有高度组织性纪律性的战斗队伍，执行三大纪律八项注意，维护群众利益，保卫国家财产。红卫兵和革命群众在斗争中学习掌握斗争的策略，运用阶级分析的方法，分清敌我，辨明是非，注意团结大多数，集中力量打击一小撮资产阶级右派分子。
    那些资产阶级老爷们，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，造谣言，放暗箭，说革命青少年“狂妄”、“幼稚”、“粗暴”，说他们的行动是“糟得很”！有些政治上的庸人和糊涂虫，也跟在这些人的屁股后面，愁眉苦脸，有无穷的忧虑，絮絮叨叨，嘁嘁喳喳。其实，所有这些，都丝毫无损于革命青少年的一根毫毛，也丝毫动摇不了他们的一颗红心。
    在无产阶级革命派看来，红卫兵和革命群众的革命言论和行动，绝不是“糟得很”，而是好得很！红卫兵和革命群众在这场文化大革命中，掌握了一个“敢”字和一个“善”字，就能成为智勇双全的闯将，敢于破“四旧”，敢于创“四新”；善于破“四旧”，善于创“四新”。无产阶级的斗争的哲学是我们进行革命斗争的锐利武器。只有和阶级敌人斗，和自然敌人斗，社会主义革命才能胜利，社会主义建设才能跃进！斗争，前进，再斗争，再前进……这就是我们的哲学。
