Editor's Note: Chairman Mao said, "A Communist Party member should care more for the Party and the people than for oneself, and care more for others than for oneself." Comrade Wang Yuchang is such a good Party member and good cadre.

Comrade Wang Yuchang has the deepest and most sincere class feelings for his class brothers and revolutionary comrades. He has the highest sense of revolutionary responsibility. He said well: "Caring for soldiers is caring for the revolution; loving comrades is loving the revolution." As a grassroots cadre in a company, he not only cares for the soldiers in every detail of their lives, but more importantly, he cares for and helps the soldiers politically and ideologically. He regards helping every soldier grow politically as his duty to the revolutionary cause; he regards arming every soldier with Mao Zedong Thought as the greatest care for his comrades, and as a great cause to cultivate successors to the proletarian revolution. Therefore, at the critical moment when the lives of his class brothers are seriously threatened, he has repeatedly risked his life to rescue his comrades. For the sake of his class brothers and the revolutionary cause, he truly gives everything he has.

Comrade Wang Yuchang's heroic deeds shine with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. For a long time, he has consciously studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, especially focusing on the "application" aspect. He said: "Studying Chairman Mao's works is not just about studying them with the brain, but also about applying them in action at all times." He practices what he preaches, and truly executes Chairman Mao's instructions and teachings with his heroic actions.

Sunlight and rain nourish the pine; Mao Zedong Thought nurtures heroes.

The great Mao Zedong Thought has nurtured countless proletarian revolutionary heroes!

Now, with hearts filled with immense excitement, we introduce another proletarian revolutionary hero of our time, Wang Yuchang, a manager in the Air Force of the Fuzhou Military Region, who has grown up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. In his daily work, he forgets himself and works selflessly for the Party with great political enthusiasm, always putting revolution first, work first, and others first. He cares deeply for the soldiers, with a high sense of class feelings; in critical moments, when facing dangerous tasks, he always steps forward bravely. He has repeatedly risked his life to rescue soldiers and sacrificed himself for the masses. People call him the "living Ouyang Hai" and the "living Wang Jie"!

At the Critical Moment

On the morning of May 30, 1965, Wang Yuchang led a team of over thirty people to conduct live grenade training under the rising sun and refreshing breeze, singing and marching forward.

The training was proceeding smoothly, and the training ground was filled with a tense atmosphere of battle.

Suddenly, an unexpected situation occurred: nineteen-year-old barber Chen Kaitai threw a grenade too forcefully and accidentally threw it behind him. The grenade drew a arc in the air, hissing and smoking, rolling into a shelter on the right! Someone shouted, "Quick!" Wang Yuchang was instructing a new soldier and heard the shout. He quickly looked up and saw that in this shelter, clerk Wu Xubin was bent over making notes, with the grenade rolling to his feet. His life was in serious danger.

The grenade was about to explode, with only 3.8 seconds left!

In this critical moment, Wang Yuchang swiftly jumped out of the shelter and lunged towards the grenade. He missed it the first time, but quickly crawled forward and managed to grab the spinning grenade by its metal head. To throw the grenade away, he had to pull back his outstretched arm. But there was no time left!

In that instant, he had a single, pure thought:

"Let me die, but not my comrade!"

He tightly grabbed the grenade's metal head, pulled his arm back sharply, and turned to shield Wu Xubin with his body. Just as he was about to throw it out, the grenade exploded in his hand!

When the soldiers' lives were seriously threatened, as a cadre, should he step forward or hesitate? Should he prioritize the safety of his class brothers or his own safety? This was a great test! In the face of this test, Wang Yuchang did not think of fear, did not think of death, had no selfish thoughts, and not a moment of hesitation.

Wang Yuchang risked his life to rescue his comrades, and this was the fifth time.

In 1957, Wang Yuchang worked in a new recruits company. During a live grenade training, a new soldier accidentally dropped a grenade with the fuse pulled. In the instant before an accident occurred, Wang Yuchang, who was not far away, rushed over and bravely threw the grenade away!

In the summer of 1962, Wang Yuchang was the deputy commander of an anti-aircraft artillery company. Once, while inspecting typhoon preparedness, he suddenly saw a large stone rolling down from the roof, about to hit the platoon leader Huang Xianrong who was working under the eaves. Wang Yuchang quickly jumped over and pushed Huang Xianrong away, but he himself did not have time to dodge. His right hand was crushed, bleeding profusely.

Not long after, the unit was moving through a narrow area, and the cannon car suddenly slid towards the side of the road, about to crush the soldier Huang Renlong. Wang Yuchang grabbed a triangular block, pushed Huang Renlong away, and quickly jumped behind the wheel. Just as he jammed the triangular block in, the wheel pressed against his shoulder. Fortunately, the triangular block worked, and the danger was averted!

On one day in 1963, the soldiers were conducting live grenade training. New soldier Luo Guoqian threw a grenade but did not throw it in time after pulling the fuse. The grenade was about to explode in his hand. Wang Yuchang rushed over, snatched the grenade, and threw it away. He also pushed Luo Guoqian to the ground and covered him with his own body.

What force drove Wang Yuchang to perform these heroic deeds of self-sacrifice? He followed Chairman Mao's teachings and the shining examples of countless revolutionary heroes. Wang Yuchang said: "Chairman Mao said: 'Our cadres must care for every soldier. Everyone in the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other.' Caring for soldiers is caring for the revolution. For the revolution, I can give everything I have."

He put his words into action.

The Greatest Care

As a grassroots cadre in a company, Comrade Wang Yuchang always cares for every soldier, forming the deepest and most sincere class feelings and revolutionary friendship with them. He deeply loves this revolutionary family. He wrote in his study notes: "This company is my home, warmer than a home with parents and children. Because this is a revolutionary family, the shining Mao Zedong Thought binds the hearts of class brothers together. I truly love it and never want to leave it!"

When a soldier falls ill, Wang Yuchang also often eats and sleeps poorly. When he was the quartermaster in the Third Company, once a soldier named Zhu Cuishu fell ill and was bedridden for several days, not wanting to eat anything. Wang Yuchang learned that Zhu was a fisherman's son and loved crabs. He decided to make a bowl of crab noodles to stimulate Zhu's appetite. He ran for over ten miles to a town, then to another town, waiting until midnight for the fishing boats to return before buying crabs. By the time he returned to the company, it was already dawn. When Zhu saw the delicious bowl of crab noodles, he was moved to tears.

A heavy rain flooded the position. The soldiers had been on standby all day, dragging all the artillery and equipment to a safe area, and it was already midnight. Back in the tent, everyone was shivering from the cold. Just then, Quartermaster Wang Yuchang arrived. He brought bowl after bowl of ginger tea to the soldiers. The soldiers knew he had also dragged the artillery all day and must be as cold and tired as they were, but he only cared for others and not himself. The soldiers held the steaming ginger tea, their hearts filled with deep emotion.

When Wang Yuchang was the company commander, the range finder Liu Qinchuan found the technology too difficult and wanted to quit. Wang Yuchang used every means to help Liu overcome this thought. He studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" with Liu. He said: "Chairman Mao said: 'Work is struggle. It seems that practicing technology must be fought like the Foolish Old Man moving mountains.' He also said: 'Liu, I think to make your technology solid, your thoughts must be solid first. If you have no selfish thoughts, your technology will definitely be as precise as Dr. Bethune's medical skills, becoming more and more proficient.' Through his patient help, Liu Qinchuan raised his ideological awareness, gave up the idea of changing jobs, and overcame the technical difficulties.

When Wang Yuchang was first transferred to the Fifth Company, he heard that a few soldiers in the telephone squad were not united. He conducted in-depth investigations and learned that the four people in the squad came from three provinces. Because they did not respect each other, the four had four different minds. Wang Yuchang addressed this situation by having heart-to-heart talks with each of them and studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune" together. Wang Yuchang said: "You see, Chairman Mao is like he has been here. He said we come from the rivers and lakes, and we five come from four provinces, all for a common revolutionary goal..." Before he finished speaking, the four bowed their heads in shame. From then on, the four united into a small collective full of class friendship.

In 1964, Comrade Wang Yuchang was to be transferred from the company to work as a manager in the headquarters. On the night before his departure, Wang Yuchang was studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Hu Jiyuan, who was to take over his work, walked over and said: "Old Wang, it's time to rest. You have to set off early tomorrow!"

Wang Yuchang looked up and said: "I am thinking that Norman Bethune did things 'with precision,' and my handover should also be precise! Think about it, is there anything I haven't handed over thoroughly?"

Hu Jiyuan said: "You should go to sleep. I can't think of anything you haven't handed over."

"Come, follow me," Wang Yuchang said, standing up. "Let's check the beds."

Checking the beds, every day. But this night's bed check left Hu Jiyuan with the most unforgettable impression.

The two of them quietly opened the door and stepped softly, from one dormitory to another. At each soldier's bed, Wang Yuchang would whisper a few words to Hu Jiyuan:

"This is Yan Fushou, from the altimeter class. He kicks in his sleep, just like he works during the day, fiercely."

"This is Wu Guanyou, from Guangdong. He kicks off the covers every night, and needs special attention." ...

After checking the last dormitory, it was already past eleven. The two of them walked shoulder to shoulder, under the moonlight, on the hilltop. Neither had any sleepiness.

Hu Jiyuan said: "Old Wang, you really care for the soldiers!"

Wang Yuchang said: "These young men are the successors of the revolutionary cause. We must be responsible for their growth, and also responsible for the revolutionary cause. We must really take good care of them!"

"You know their temperaments so well."

"Haha, far from it," Wang Yuchang said. "Someone said, 'Leading soldiers means leading their hearts, knowing their hearts means caring for their hearts.' That's right. But I think the greatest care is to let them read Chairman Mao's books, lead them onto the path indicated by Chairman Mao, and use Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate them into successors of the revolutionary cause who have their hearts with the motherland and their eyes on the world. With this standard, my work as a company commander still falls short!"

Hu Jiyuan did not say anything more. But in his heart, he thought: Taking over his work means taking over his deep class feelings and high sense of revolutionary responsibility for the soldiers. This feeling, this responsibility, concentrated in one point, is to use Mao Zedong Thought to nurture the soldiers into truly excellent successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Body Injured but Spirit Unbroken, Forever for the People

In the hospital, Wang Yuchang woke from his coma. His first words were: "How is the clerk? Is he in danger?" People told him that the clerk had only a slight scratch, and he was relieved.

The next dawn, he woke from his sleep again and immediately asked the medical staff to find a set of keys on his body. He said: "I am a manager. Losing the keys is like a soldier losing his weapon."

Wang Yuchang's injuries were severe, and the first major comprehensive surgery lasted ten hours. Wang Yuchang, with his tenacious revolutionary spirit, overcame the first danger. Who can imagine the immense pain he endured! But at this moment, what he cared about most was not himself, but his comrades and the Party's work!

The unit commander came to the hospital to visit him. He was so moved that his eyes welled up with tears, and it took a long time for him to say a sentence: "I... did not complete the task, I am sorry to the Party..."

A commander asked him what he needed, and he said: "I have no requests, only my Chairman Mao's works are not here, please ask someone to bring them to me. I need to read Chairman Mao's books more than ever."

Wang Yuchang's severely injured right leg showed signs of "necrosis." To save his life, the hospital suggested amputation. When Wang Yuchang learned that the unit party committee had agreed, he immediately agreed: "Everything follows the Party's decision!"

Wang Yuchang's condition improved somewhat, and he actively worked for the Party. Hearing the moans and cries from the next room, he asked the nurse to push his bed to this comrade's side, had a heart-to-heart talk with him, recalled bitterness and sweetness together, and encouraged him to fight against the disease. Seeing that soldier Jiang Chuangu was in great pain after the operation, he hobbled over to his side, encouraged him with Chairman Mao's words, studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together, and sang "The East Is Red" together. He said to him: "We are recuperating and treating diseases also for the revolution, and we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought."

A few months later, Wang Yuchang's condition improved significantly. The leadership sent him to Shanghai for reconstructive surgery and fitted him with an artificial leg. From the day he was fitted with the artificial leg, he insisted on practicing walking. He did not want anyone's help, did not use a cane, and stood up with his tall figure, pressing his 160-plus pounds of weight onto that artificial leg. The freshly healed skin and flesh of the wound were stretched taut, burning like fire, and his whole body was covered in cold sweat. The nurse wanted to help him, but he declined, saying: "Chairman Mao told us to make up our minds, not to fear sacrifice, to overcome all difficulties, and to strive for victory! I must now overcome the pain of injury and strive for the victory of walking!"

Mao Zedong Thought inspired him to train tenaciously, from being able to walk one or two meters, to tens of meters, hundreds of meters, two hundred meters...

Yes, soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the strongest will and the hardest bones! No matter how great the pain, it cannot suppress Wang Yuchang's revolutionary optimism! During the operation, he often endured so much pain that beads of sweat formed on his forehead. When the nurse gave him painkillers or pain-relieving drugs, he always said: "To overcome pain, drugs can only play a partial role, and the more important thing is the spiritual effect."

After his right leg was amputated, the nurses were very sad, but he said cheerfully: "Why be sad? I will walk the revolutionary road with one leg. I will stride forward on the revolutionary path!" He also comforted his comrades around him: "Don't be sad for me, I still have my left hand and left leg! More importantly, I still have a heart to serve the people. As long as I am still breathing, I can work for the Party. If my hands and feet are completely gone, I still have a mouth! I will use it to propagate Mao Zedong Thought every day, inspire comrades, and strike down the enemy." He also said: "It is the Party that gave me a second life. Although my body is disabled, I am not disabled in spirit. I will dedicate my second life, given by the Party, to the Party without reservation, and forever devote myself to serving the people."

Wang Yuchang was born in a poor lower-middle peasant family in Jimo County, Shandong Province. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, this ordinary farmer combined his life with the glorious and magnificent cause of communism, understanding why people live, how to hate the enemy, and love comrades. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the bright red sun in his heart. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the source of his fearlessness and courage to dedicate everything for the revolution in the face of all difficulties and dangers!

    关心战士就是关心革命
    ——记毛主席的好战士、爱兵模范王裕昌
    玉学　永祥　豆豆　天中　启夫
    编者按：毛主席说，一个共产党员，应该是“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重”。王裕昌同志就是这样一个好党员、好干部。
    王裕昌同志对自己的阶级兄弟、革命同志，有着最真挚、最深厚的阶级感情，有着最高度的革命责任感。他说得好：“关心战士，就是关心革命；热爱同志，就是热爱革命。”作为一个连队的基层干部，在平时，他不仅从生活上无微不至地关心战士，更重要的是从政治上和思想上关心和帮助战士。他把帮助每一个战士在政治上的成长，看作自己对革命事业义不容辞的责任；把用毛泽东思想武装每一个战士，看作是对同志最大的关心，看作是培养无产阶级革命接班人的崇高事业。正因为如此，在阶级兄弟的生命遭到严重威胁的关键时刻，他多次冒着生命危险，挺身而出，抢救同志。为了阶级兄弟，为了革命事业，真正做到了“豁出自己的一切”。
    王裕昌同志的英雄事迹，闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。长期以来，他自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫。他说：“学习毛主席著作，不仅用脑子去钻研，而且要时时刻刻用行动去体现。”他说到做到，言行一致，真正用自己的英雄行为，执行了毛主席的指示和教导。
    阳光雨露育青松，毛泽东思想哺英雄。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，哺育出多少无产阶级的革命英雄人物！
    现在，我们怀着万分激动的心情，介绍我们时代的又一个在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的无产阶级革命英雄、福州部队空军某部的管理员王裕昌。平时，他以极大的政治热情忘我地为党工作，处处表现了革命第一，工作第一，他人第一。对战士关怀备至，有高度的阶级感情；在紧要关头，遇有艰险任务，他总是挺身而出，奋勇当先。他屡次冒着生命危险，抢救战士，舍身为群众。人们称他是“活着的欧阳海”，“活着的王杰”！
    在关键的时刻
    一九六五年五月三十日清晨，王裕昌带领着一支由三十多人组成的小分队，迎着旭日，浴着清风，高歌阔步地去进行手榴弹实弹训练。
    投掷训练在顺利进行，训练场上洋溢着一片紧张的战斗气氛。
    突然，发生了一个意外情况：十九岁的理发员陈开泰投弹的时候，因为用力过猛，失手把手榴弹甩向了身后。手榴弹在空中绕了一个弧线，嗤嗤地冒着青烟，滚进了右边一个掩体里！有人大喊了一声：“快”！王裕昌正在辅导一个新战士，听见喊声，猛地抬头一看，只见在这个掩体里，文书吴绪斌正在埋头作记录，手榴弹已经滚落在他的脚边。他的生命正受着严重的威胁。
    手榴弹要开花，时间只要三秒八！
    在这千钧一发之际，王裕昌唰地从掩体里跳出来，向这颗手榴弹猛扑过去。他一把没有抓住，又疾速匍匐着向前蹿了一蹿，好容易才抓住正在飞速旋转的手榴弹的铁头。要把手榴弹甩出去，就必须把伸直的胳臂缩回来。可是，时间已经来不及了！
    在这一瞬间，他脑子里闪过一个最最单纯的念头：
    “宁死我一个，不能死战友！”
    他紧紧抓着手榴弹的铁头，猛地将胳臂往回一收，又一个侧转，用身子严严实实地挡住吴绪斌。就在这时，没等他往外投掷，手榴弹在他的掌心里爆炸了！
    当战士的生命遭到严重威胁的紧急时刻，作为一个干部，是挺身而出，还是畏缩不前？是首先考虑阶级兄弟的生命安全，还是首先计较个人的安危？这是一个巨大的考验！在这个考验面前，王裕昌没有想到怕，没有想到死，没有一丁点私心杂念，没有一丝丝犹豫不决。
    王裕昌冒着生命危险，挺身而出，抢救战友，这已经是第五次了。
    一九五七年，王裕昌在一个新兵连工作。一次实弹投掷训练，一位新战士，不慎将拉开导火索的手榴弹失手丢在身边。在即将造成事故的瞬间，站在不远处的王裕昌猛冲过去，冒险抓起这颗手榴弹投了出去！
    一九六二年夏天，王裕昌在高炮连当副连长。有一次，他在检查防台风准备工作，突然看到压在屋顶上的一块大石头往下滚，眼看就要砸到正在屋檐下劳动的一班长黄先容头上。王裕昌一个箭步跃过去，猛力推开黄先容，而自己却来不及躲避了。他的右手被砸得鲜血直流。
    在那以后不久，部队行进在一个狭窄地带，炮车突然朝路边侧滑，眼看要压住战士黄仁龙。王裕昌夺过三角木，推开黄仁龙，唰地蹿到车轮后面，就在他塞进三角木的同时，车轮已经抵住他的肩膀，幸亏三角木起了作用，这才化险为夷！
    一九六三年的一天，战士们正在进行手榴弹实弹投掷训练。新战士罗国强投弹时，拉开导火索后没有及时投出去，手榴弹在他手里眼看就要爆炸。王裕昌几步奔过去，夺过手榴弹扔了出去，并且把罗国强压倒在地上，自己用身体掩护着他。
    是什么力量促使王裕昌多次做出舍己救人的英雄壮举呢？他是照着毛主席的教导，照着无数革命英雄的光辉榜样去做的。王裕昌说：“毛主席说：‘我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。’关心战士，就是关心革命。为了革命，我可以豁出自己的一切。”
    他用实际行动实践了自己的誓言。
    最大的关心
    作为一个连队的基层干部，王裕昌同志时时刻刻关怀着每一个战士，和他们结下了最真挚、最深厚的阶级感情和革命友谊。他非常热爱部队这个革命的大家庭。他在学习笔记里写道：“我这个连队的家，比有父母子女的那个家温暖得多。因为这是革命的大家庭，金光闪闪的毛泽东思想把阶级兄弟的心都连结在一起。我真爱它，一刻也不想离开它！”
    战士生了病，王裕昌也常常跟着吃不好，睡不好。他在三连当司务长的时候，有一次，战士朱采蜀病了，接连几天卧床不起，什么东西也不想吃。王裕昌了解到小朱是渔民子弟，最爱吃螃蟹。他决心为小朱做碗螃蟹面开开胃口。他跑了十几里路，到了一个镇子又到一个镇子，一直等到半夜，出海的渔船回来，才买到螃蟹。赶回连队的时候，天已放亮了。当小朱端起一碗味道鲜美的螃蟹面时，激动得流下泪来。
    一场暴雨，淹没了阵地。战士们备战一天，把全部火炮器材拖到安全地带，已经是深夜十二点了。回到帐篷，大家冻得浑身打颤颤。正在这时候，司务长王裕昌来了。他把一碗碗姜汤送到战士手里。战士们明明知道他也拖了一天炮，这会儿一定跟大伙一样又冷又累，可他却只顾大伙，不顾自己。战士们端着热腾腾的姜汤，心里万分激动。
    王裕昌当连长的时候，八测手刘钦传嫌技术太难，想打退堂鼓。王裕昌千方百计地帮助小刘克服了这种思想。他和小刘一起学习《愚公移山》。他说：“毛主席说：工作就是斗争，看来，练技术非得像愚公移山那样斗争不可。”又说：“小刘啊，我看要想技术练得硬，先得思想过得硬。要是没有私心杂念了，技术就一定会像白求恩的医术一样，越来越精。”经过他的耐心帮助，刘钦传提高了思想觉悟，打消了改行的念头，技术难关也克服了。
    王裕昌刚调到五连的时候，听说电话班几位战士不团结。他就深入地调查研究，了解到这个班的四个人，来自三个省。因为互相不服气，四个人四条心。王裕昌针对这个情况，分别同他们谈心，和他们一起学习《为人民服务》。王裕昌说：“你们看，毛主席像是到过咱们这儿。他老人家说咱们来自五湖四海，咱们五个人正好来自四个省，都是为着一个共同的革命目标来的……”他的话还没有说完，四个人都羞愧得低下了头。打那以后，四个人团结成一个充满阶级友爱的小集体。
    一九六四年，王裕昌同志要调离连队，到机关去做管理员工作。临走的头天晚上，王裕昌正在学习《纪念白求恩》。接替他工作的胡家远同志走过来说：“老王，该歇了，明天你还要赶路哩！”
    王裕昌抬起头说：“我在想，白求恩办事‘精益求精’，我这交班也得来个精益求精啊！你想想，还有那些事没有交代周到的？”
    胡家远说：“你快睡觉吧，我再也想不起有啥没交代的事情了。”
    “走，你跟我走一趟。”王裕昌说着站起来，“咱们查铺去。”
    查铺，天天查。可这天晚上的查铺，却给胡家远留下了最难忘的印象。
    他俩轻轻地开门，悄悄地迈步，从这个宿舍走到那个宿舍。走到每个战士的床边，王裕昌都要在胡家远的耳边小声交代几句：
    “这是严福寿，是测高机班的。他睡觉爱蹬腿，跟白天干活一样，猛打猛冲。”
    “这是吴观有，广东人。他每天夜里掀被子，得特别关照。”……
    查完最后一个宿舍，已经十一点多。他俩肩并着肩，踏着月色，在山头上漫步。谁也没有一点睡意。
    胡家远说：“老王，你真是对战士关怀到家啦！”
    王裕昌说：“这些小伙子都是革命事业接班人。我们要对他们的成长负责，也是对革命事业负责。对他们可真得精心关照着点！”
    “你把他们的脾性摸得那么熟。”
    “嘿嘿，差得远哩。”王裕昌说：“有人讲‘带兵要带心，带心要知心，知心要关心。’这话很对。不过，我倒想，最大的关心，是让他们读毛主席的书，把他们带到毛主席指引的道路上，用毛泽东思想把他们培育成心怀祖国、放眼世界的革命事业的接班人。用这个标准要求，我这连长的工作，还差得远哪！”
    胡家远没有再说什么。可心里在想：接他的工作，就要接过他对战士深厚的阶级感情，高度的革命责任心。这种感情，这种责任心，集中在一点，就是用毛泽东思想把战士们哺育成真正优秀的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    身残志不残　永远为人民
    在医院里，王裕昌从昏迷中醒来。第一句话就问：“文书怎么样？有没有危险？”人们告诉他，文书只擦破了点皮，他才放心了。
    第二天黎明，他再次从昏睡中醒过来，睁开眼就要医务人员替他找到身上的一串钥匙。他说：“我是管理员，丢了钥匙，就像战士丢了武器一样。”
    王裕昌的伤势很重，第一次大型综合手术进行了十个小时。王裕昌以顽强的革命精神，战胜了第一道险关。谁能想象到他忍受着多么巨大的疼痛啊！然而这时他心里最惦记的却不是自己，而是战友，是党的工作！
    部队首长到医院来看望他。他激动得两眼闪着泪花，好久才说出一句话：“我……没有完成任务，对不起党……。”
    一位首长问他需要什么，他说：“我什么要求也没有，只是我的毛主席著作没有带来，请托人给我捎来。我现在更需要读毛主席的书。”
    王裕昌被严重炸伤的右腿，发生了“坏死”现象。为了挽救他的生命，医院建议截肢。当王裕昌得知部队党委已经同意，便毫不犹豫地表示：一切听从党的决定！
    王裕昌的伤势有了一点好转，他便积极主动地为党工作。听到隔壁病房里有呻吟喊叫的声音，他就请护士把他的床推到这个同志身边，和他谈心，同他一起忆苦思甜，鼓励他向疾病作斗争。看到战士江传谷开刀以后很痛苦，便一瘸一拐地走到他的身边，用毛主席的话鼓励他，和他一起学习《毛主席语录》，一起唱《大海航行靠舵手》。并对他说：“咱们养伤治病，也是为了革命，也要靠毛泽东思想。”
    几个月后，王裕昌的伤势大大好转了。领导上又送他到上海进行整形手术，并在这里安装了假腿。从装上假腿的第一天起，他就顽强地锻炼走路。他不要人扶，不用拐杖，高大的躯体颤巍巍地站起来，把一百六十多斤的体重，压在那条假腿上。那刚刚愈合的嫩皮嫩肉的伤口，绷得像烈火炙烤般的钻心痛，浑身沁出了冷汗。护士要帮助他，他谢绝说：“毛主席不是要我们下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利吗？我现在要排除伤痛的万难，去争取走路的胜利！”
    毛泽东思想鼓舞着他进行顽强的锻炼，从能走一、二米，到十几米，几十米，一百米，二百米……。
    是的，用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，意志最坚强，骨头最硬，多么大的痛苦，也压不住王裕昌的革命乐观主义精神！做手术时，常痛得他额角上沁出豆大的汗珠，他咬紧牙关忍受着。当护士给他打止痛针、吃止痛药时，他总是说：“要战胜伤痛，药物只能起部分作用，更重要的还是靠精神作用。”
    他右腿被截肢以后，护士们心里都很难过，他却豪放地说：“难过什么？我一条腿也要走革命的路。也要在革命的大道上阔步前进！”他还安慰周围的同志：“你们不要怕我难过，我还有左手左腿嘛！更重要的是我还有一颗为人民服务的心。只要我一分钟没有停止呼吸，我就能为党工作。万一我的手和脚全坏了，我还有一张嘴！我要用它天天宣传毛泽东思想，用它鼓舞同志，打击敌人。”他又说：“是党给了我第二次生命。我的身体虽然残废了，但我身残志不残。我要把党给我的第二次生命毫无保留地献给党，永远投入到为人民服务之中去。”
    王裕昌出生在山东省即墨县一个贫苦的下中农家庭。在毛泽东思想的哺育下，使这个普普通通的农民，把自己的一生同光辉壮丽的共产主义事业结合起来，懂得了人为什么活着，应当怎样去恨敌人，爱同志。伟大的毛泽东思想，是他心中光芒万丈的红太阳。伟大的毛泽东思想，是他在一切艰难危险面前无所畏惧、勇于为革命献出自己一切的力量源泉！（附图片）
