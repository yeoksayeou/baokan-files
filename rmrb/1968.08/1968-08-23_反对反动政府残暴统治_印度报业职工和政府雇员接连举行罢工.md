In recent times, Indian newspaper workers and government employees have been continuously engaged in struggles against the brutal rule of the Indian reactionary government and for wage increases, causing the Indian reactionary government to be both annoyed and frightened.

Newspaper workers from major cities such as New Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras have been on strike for a month. On the 20th, approximately one thousand newspaper workers held a demonstration march in New Delhi. Their struggle has received support from workers in New Delhi and employees of news agencies.

The Indian reactionary government held a cabinet meeting on the 20th to discuss schemes to deal with the newspaper workers' strike, deciding to have the Minister of Labor act as a "mediator" between the striking workers and the capitalists, essentially pressuring the workers to abandon their struggle.

Government employees from various states in India went on strike in July. On the 13th of August, ten thousand central government employees held a rally in New Delhi, strongly opposing the Indian reactionary government's brutal suppression of workers and protesting the arrest of worker leaders. Currently, some revisionist elements and other scabs who have infiltrated government employee unions in various places are desperately trying to sell out the struggle of government employees.

In recent days, students in some Indian cities have also been engaged in struggles against the brutal rule. On the 20th, in Amravati, Maharashtra State, reactionary police opened fire on three thousand demonstrators, killing and injuring more than twenty people. In Akola, student demonstrations against the brutal rule have been ongoing, with reactionary police arresting more than eight hundred people.

    反对反动政府残暴统治
    印度报业职工和政府雇员接连举行罢工
    新华社二十二日讯　新德里消息：最近一个时期以来，印度报馆职工和政府雇员接连开展反对印度反动政府的暴政和争取提高工资的斗争，使印度反动政府又恼又怕。
    印度新德里、加尔各答、孟买、马德拉斯等地一些销路最广的报纸的职工举行的罢工斗争，已经坚持了一个月。二十日，大约一千名报馆职工在新德里举行示威游行。他们的斗争受到新德里工人和通讯社职工的支持。
    印度反动政府在二十日举行内阁会议，研究了对付报馆职工罢工的阴谋诡计，决定由劳工部长出面在罢工职工和资本家之间进行“调解”，实际上是压迫职工放弃斗争。
    印度一些邦的政府雇员在七月间相继举行大罢工。中央政府的雇员一万人八月十三日在新德里举行集会，强烈反对印度反动政府横蛮地压制工人，抗议反动政府逮捕工人领袖。目前，混入各地政府雇员工会中的一些修正主义分子和其他工贼，正在竭力出卖政府雇员的斗争。
    最近几天来，在印度的一些城镇中还发生了学生反对暴政的斗争。二十日在马哈拉施特拉邦的阿姆瓦蒂，反动警察开枪镇压三千名示威群众，打死打伤二十多人。在阿科拉，连日发生学生反暴政示威，反动警察逮捕了八百多人。
