	Chairman Mao, you are warmer than the sun a thousand times!

	The active propagandist of studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong Thought in the Chengdu Military Region, Zhang Kewen, a section chief of a certain unit.

	Every day I think of it, every day I long for it, a wish I have had for many years has finally come true, the most joyful moment has finally arrived! On the afternoon of August 11, 1968, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin received us. This is the greatest care for us, and it is also our greatest happiness and greatest glory. We saw that Chairman Mao's health is extremely good, and Vice Chairman Lin's health is also very good. We feel extremely happy and extremely joyful. Our emotions are surging, our blood is boiling, we have a thousand words to say, but we do not know which one to say first, we have a thousand songs to sing, but we do not know which one to sing first. All the heartfelt words we have are condensed into one voice: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

	Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You love revolutionary fighters the most, and we are the most loyal to you. The sun is warm, but you are a thousand times warmer, parents are kind, but you are ten thousand times kinder. You are the eternal red sun in our hearts, you are our closest and dearest confidant. Seeing you is the greatest happiness, following you closely is the greatest victory. Children cannot leave their mothers, melons cannot leave their vines. Revolutionary fighters can never leave you, can never leave your brilliant thoughts, can never leave your revolutionary line.

	In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we followed your great instructions: "The People's Liberation Army should support the leftist broad masses." I carried my bag and the Little Red Book, went into the factories, and fought side by side with revolutionary workers. Following your great teachings, I went to the workshops, visited the dormitories, and did in-depth and detailed political and ideological work, helping the two revolutionary factions to unite and direct their struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as China's Khrushchev, and launch a magnificent revolutionary criticism. We deeply feel that: propagating your brilliant thoughts is victory, implementing your latest instructions is victory, following your great strategic deployments is victory.

	We are determined to take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, to be forever loyal to you, forever loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line; to read your books for a lifetime, listen to your words, act according to your instructions, and be your good soldier. I am determined to closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by you and Vice Chairman Lin, follow your great strategic deployments, fully implement your series of latest instructions, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, unify our will, unify our steps, and unify our actions, and strike the handful of class enemies steadily, accurately, and fiercely, to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　毛主席啊，您比太阳暖千倍！
　　成都部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、某部科长　张可文
    天天想，日日盼，多年的愿望终于实现了，最最幸福的时刻终于来到了！一九六八年八月十一日下午，我们伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席接见了我们。这是对我们最大的关怀，也是我们最大的幸福，最大的光荣。我们看到毛主席的身体非常非常健康，林副主席的身体也很健康，我们感到无比幸福，无比高兴。我们心情激荡，热血沸腾，千言万语，不知先说哪一句，千歌万曲，不知先唱哪一支，满腹贴心话儿汇成一个声音：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您对革命战士最爱，我们对您老人家最忠。太阳暖，您比太阳暖千倍，爹娘亲，您比爹娘亲万分。您是我们心中永远不落的红太阳，您是我们最亲最亲的贴心人。见到您就是最大最大的幸福，紧跟您就是最大最大的胜利。孩儿离不开娘，瓜儿离不开秧。革命战士永远离不开您，永远离不开您的光辉思想，永远离不开您的革命路线。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们遵照您的伟大指示：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”我背着背包，带着红色宝书，走进工厂，和革命工人并肩战斗。遵循您的伟大教导，下车间，串宿舍，做深入细致的政治思想工作，帮助两派革命群众联合起来，把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，掀起轰轰烈烈的革命大批判。我们深深体会到：宣传您的光辉思想就是胜利，落实您的最新指示就是胜利，紧跟您的伟大战略部署就是胜利。
    我们决心以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于您，永远忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线；一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。我决心紧密团结在以您为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的周围，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，全面落实您的一系列最新指示，在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部领导下，统一意志、统一步伐、统一行动，稳、准、狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
