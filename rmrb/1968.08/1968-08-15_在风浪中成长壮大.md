    Growing Strong in the Storm

    Editor's Note: On August 6, 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the Qi Li Camp People's Commune in Xinxiang, Henan. Over the past ten years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in this commune, under the warm guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, have braved the black wind and fought against the evil waves, holding high the red banner of the people's commune, fully displaying the superiority of the people's commune's "one big, two publics," and achieving outstanding results, demonstrating the strong vitality of the people's commune. They have used ironclad facts to refute the malicious attacks by the Chinese Khrushchev and his black henchmen on the people's commune.

    Ten years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out with great wisdom: "The people's commune is good!" Ten years later, today, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Qi Li Camp Commune, with their ten years of practice and personal experience, enthusiastically hail: The people's commune is indeed good!

    Henan Xinxiang Qi Li Camp People's Commune is one of the earliest people's communes established in the country. On August 4, 1958, the commune was established. On August 6, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao came to Qi Li Camp for an inspection. He inquired about the establishment of the commune, visited the cotton experimental field, praised the community-run flour mill and other industries, and also visited the kindergarten and had a cordial conversation with the elderly in the nursing home. He issued the great directive: "The people's commune is good!"

    Ten years ago, Chairman Mao's inspection of Qi Li Camp People's Commune was the greatest care and encouragement for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in this commune. Over the past ten years, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Qi Li Camp Commune, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overcome one difficulty after another, achieved one victory after another, and grown and strengthened in the storms of class struggle.

    During the three years of natural disasters in our country, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents thought the time had come and jumped out crazily, pushing the black goods of restoring capitalism, attempting to topple the red flag of Qi Li Camp People's Commune. The henchmen of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as Tan Zhenlin, under the guise of "democratically managing the commune," brought a gang of thugs and came to Qi Li Camp with murderous intent. They completely denied the superiority of the people's commune's "one big, two publics," spreading the reactionary fallacy that "the smaller the commune, the better." They forcibly divided Qi Li Camp People's Commune into smaller units. The poor and lower-middle peasants listened to Chairman Mao's words and firmly rejected anything that did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, Tan Zhenlin's work team notified the brigade leaders to attend a meeting, but none of the brigade leaders went; they all went home to sleep. They then notified the commune members to attend a meeting, but the commune members locked their doors. The counter-revolutionary revisionist gang of Tan Zhenlin did not give up and actually demolished the memorial hall where Chairman Mao inspected the fields and disbanded the cotton specialty team of the "Red Flag" experimental field. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, were so angry that our hands trembled. We said furiously: Go ahead and demolish! You can demolish the memorial hall, but you can never demolish our red heart of loyalty to Chairman Mao! We put our efforts into managing the experimental field: when the work team came, we left; when the work team left, we went; if we couldn't manage during the day, we went at night. We broke through numerous obstacles and difficulties and finally achieved a bumper harvest of over 190 jin of lint cotton per mu.

    This gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists, failing in one scheme, came up with another. They forced the commune party committee to implement the retrogressive policy of "borrowing land." The commune party committee held a meeting in Liuzhuang to solicit the opinions of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Isn't this making us reverse course? We should write to Chairman Mao to find out who came up with this bad idea and not let us build socialism." The commune party committee listened to the masses' opinions, stood firm, and resisted. The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev, enraged and ashamed, forced the militia instructor of Liuzhuang Brigade and representative to the National Militia Representatives Conference, Comrade Shi Laihe, to convene a commune members' meeting, using voting to let the commune members and militia express their attitudes. Of the more than 400 participants, except for a few well-off middle peasants, all the poor and lower-middle peasants and militia voted against, shattering their dream of restoring capitalism.

    However, the class enemies will not readily admit defeat. They are always ready to counterattack. The blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led by our great leader Chairman Mao, reached Qi Li Camp, and a handful of capitalist roaders jumped out again. They played tricks, deceived the masses, and framed and persecuted revolutionary cadres, doing all kinds of evil. But the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, saw through their tricks, mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to launch a counterattack, and dragged out the capitalist roaders one by one, criticizing and denouncing them. After the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, the red flag of Qi Li Camp People's Commune shone even brighter.

　　在风浪中成长壮大
    编者按：一九五八年八月六日，我们的伟大领袖毛主席视察了河南新乡七里营人民公社。十年来，这个公社的广大贫下中农，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切教导下，顶黑风，战恶浪，高举着人民公社这面红旗，充分发挥了人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，创造了优异的成绩，显示出人民公社的强大生命力。他们用钢铁一般的事实，回击了中国赫鲁晓夫及其黑爪牙们对人民公社的恶毒攻击。
    十年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席极其英明地指出：“人民公社好”！十年后的今天，七里营公社的广大贫下中农和革命干部，以他们十年的实践和亲身的经历，热烈地欢呼：人民公社就是好！
    河南新乡七里营人民公社，是全国最早建立的人民公社之一。一九五八年八月四日公社成立，八月六日，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席来到七里营进行了视察。他老人家询问了公社的建立情况，观看了棉花试验田，赞扬了面粉厂等社办工业，还看了幼儿园，和敬老院里的老人进行了亲切交谈。并发出了“人民公社好”的伟大指示。
    十年前，毛主席视察七里营人民公社，对这个公社的广大贫下中农和革命干部是最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞。十年来，七里营人民公社贫下中农遵照毛主席教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜了一个又一个困难，取得了一个又一个胜利，在阶级斗争的风浪中成长、壮大。
    在我国三年自然灾害期间，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人认为时机已到，疯狂地跳了出来，大肆推行复辟资本主义的黑货，妄图把七里营人民公社这面红旗搞垮。中国赫鲁晓夫的心腹干将谭震林之流，以“民主办社”为名，带着一班打手，杀气腾腾地来到七里营，他们一口否定人民公社“一大二公”的优越性，散布公社“越小越好”的反动谬论，强制把七里营人民公社划小。贫下中农最听毛主席的话，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的就坚决顶回去。当时，谭震林的工作组通知队长开会，队长们没有一个人去，都回家睡觉了。他们又通知社员开会，社员们就把街门反锁上。反革命修正主义分子谭震林一伙并不甘心失败，竟然把毛主席视察田纪念馆拆除了，并解散了“红旗”试验田的棉花专业队。我们贫下中农气得双手发抖，愤怒地说：你拆吧！你可以拆掉纪念馆，但永远拆不掉我们忠于毛主席的一颗红心！我们把劲用到试验田的管理上：工作组来了我们走，工作组走了我们去；白天不能管，就晚上去。我们冲破了重重障碍和困难，终于使试验田获得了亩产皮棉一百九十多斤的好收成。
    这一伙反革命修正主义分子一计不成，又生一计，硬压着公社党委推行“借地”倒退政策。公社党委深入刘庄开座谈会，征求贫下中农的意见。贫下中农说：“这不是叫咱开倒车吗？咱给毛主席去个信，看是谁出的孬点子，不让咱搞社会主义。”公社党委听从了群众的意见，硬着头皮顶住了，中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人恼羞成怒，强逼着刘庄大队民兵指导员、全国民兵代表会议代表史来贺同志召开社员大会，用投票的办法，让社员、民兵表示态度。参加大会的四百多人，除了几个富裕中农。广大贫下中农和民兵都投了反对票，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的迷梦。
    然而阶级敌人是不会甘心失败的，他们时刻准备反扑。伟大的领袖毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火烧到了七里营，一小撮走资派又跳了出来，他们玩弄阴谋诡计，蒙蔽群众，打击陷害革命领导干部，干尽坏事。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农和无产阶级革命派，心明眼亮，识破了他们的阴谋诡计，发动广大革命群众进行反击，把走资派一个个的揪了出来，批倒批臭。经过两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗，七里营人民公社这面红旗更加鲜艳夺目。七里营人民公社人民武
