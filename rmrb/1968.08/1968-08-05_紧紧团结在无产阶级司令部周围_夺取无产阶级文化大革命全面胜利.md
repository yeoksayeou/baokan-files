Two years ago, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, with the genius and courage of the greatest proletarian revolutionary, issued the "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster at the historic Party's Eighth Central Committee's Eleventh Plenum. Chairman Mao's big-character poster sounded the charge to thoroughly smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev, and is the great battle program to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

At the time when the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao, swept across the country, and at the crucial moment of the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, we resolutely carried out the combat orders of the great commander Chairman Mao and Vice Commander Lin. We marched into Jiangxi to support the left. Under the leadership of our excellent platoon leader Comrade Li Wenzhong, we studied Chairman Mao's "Bombard the Headquarters" big-character poster again and again. The more we studied, the clearer our minds became, and the stronger our fighting spirit grew. Chairman Mao's big-character poster pointed out the grand direction for our support-left work and added boundless fighting strength to us.

	"Chairman Mao loves me, I love Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao supports me, I support Chairman Mao; Chairman Mao directs me, I follow; Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance!" The broad masses of soldiers and our comrades in the platoon resolutely responded to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao to "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." We united and fought together with the revolutionary masses, launching one fierce attack after another against the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev and its agents in various places, achieving one great victory after another.

The two years of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have made us deeply realize that all the victories we have achieved in the struggle are the victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and are the results of the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. To follow the great leader Chairman Mao is victory! To follow the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is victory!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat, and they will make their last struggles." In the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the Party, unwilling to accept their doom, are continuing their desperate struggles. These bad elements, in order to achieve their wild dream of overthrowing the proletarian revolutionary regime, will inevitably direct their spears at the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We must thoroughly expose and give a crushing blow to all the tricks and deceits of the handful of class enemies who attempt to shake the proletarian headquarters!

We must also warn those who hold the erroneous idea of "multiple centers." Your so-called "multiple centers" is a reactionary theory of bourgeois factionalism and individualism. If this idea is allowed to develop without being quickly corrected, it will slide onto the dangerous path of detaching from and even opposing the proletarian headquarters. We must further strengthen the proletarian concept of unity, strengthen revolutionary organizational discipline, closely unite around the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    两年前，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，以最伟大的无产阶级革命家的天才和气魄，在具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十一中全会上发表了《炮打司令部》的大字报。毛主席的大字报，吹响了彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的进军号，是将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的伟大战斗纲领。
    在伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火燃遍祖国大地的时候，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线生死决战的关键时刻，我们坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席和林副统帅的战斗命令，进驻江西支左。我们在好排长李文忠同志的带领下，一遍又一遍地学习了毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报。我们越学越心明眼亮，越学斗志越旺。毛主席的大字报，给我们指明了支左工作的大方向，给我们增添了无穷的战斗力量。
      “毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进！”广大指战员和我们排的同志们，坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，同革命派团结、战斗在一起，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部及其在各地的代理人，发动了一次又一次的猛烈进攻，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。
    两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们更加深刻地体会到，我们在斗争中所取得的一切胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，都是以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部英明领导的结果。紧跟伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利！紧跟以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部就是胜利！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”在当前无产阶级文化大革命的一片大好形势下，党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，不甘心于他们的灭亡，正在继续进行垂死的挣扎。这些坏家伙为了达到他们妄想颠覆无产阶级革命政权的阴谋，必然要把矛头指向以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部。对于一小撮阶级敌人妄想动摇无产阶级司令部的一切阴谋诡计，我们一定要彻底揭露，给以毁灭性的打击！
    我们还要正告那些抱有“多中心论”这种错误思想的人，你们的所谓“多中心论”，是一种资产阶级山头主义、个人主义的反动理论。你们的这种思想如果任其发展下去而不迅速纠正，就会滑到脱离以至对抗无产阶级司令部的危险道路上去。我们一定要进一步加强无产阶级的整体观念，加强革命的组织纪律性，紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部周围，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
