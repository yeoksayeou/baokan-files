Farmers struggling on the brink of starvation rise in rebellion
Indian farmers in Uttar Pradesh launch land seizure struggles
Farmers in Nampura and other areas seize back over 20,000 acres of land usurped by landlords, causing panic among the reactionary ruling authorities

	New Delhi, Aug. 1 (Xinhua) — Farmers in some parts of Uttar Pradesh, India, are engaged in struggles to seize land from the reactionary ruling class.

	According to Indian newspapers, in the Nampura area of Bahraich District in northern Uttar Pradesh, 5,000 landless poor farmers, despite police suppression, seized back approximately 21,000 acres of land usurped by big landlords. The farmers also harvested the crops on the seized land. Farmers in the Pranpur area of Pilibhit District seized back 1,000 acres of land usurped by landlords. In Unnao District near Lucknow, farmers also seized back about 500 acres of land from the landlord class.

	Class struggle in the rural areas of Uttar Pradesh is extremely sharp, and feudal exploitation is severe. For a long time, feudal lords, big landlords, big farmers, big merchants, government officials, and others have continuously plundered large amounts of land from farmers and appropriated it for themselves.

	Recently, farmers struggling on the brink of starvation have risen in rebellion, seizing land back from these exploiters and plunderers. The rebellious actions of the farmers have caused great panic among the reactionary ruling authorities. Big landlords and the reactionary government have colluded to brutally suppress the land-seizing farmers. According to the Indian weekly "Link," as soon as they discover landless farmers attempting to occupy land, they immediately mobilize a large number of hired thugs to beat the farmers with iron rods and sticks, and open fire on the farmers. The reactionary government also sends police to arrest farmers.

	Great teacher Chairman Mao pointed out: "The economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasantry by the landlord class compel the peasants to rise in rebellion time and again to oppose the rule of the landlord class." The land seizure struggles of the farmers in Uttar Pradesh are just struggles. No matter how brutally the Indian reactionary government and feudal landlords suppress them, they cannot stop the farmers from rising up to fight their enemies and seek their own liberation and emancipation.

　　在饥饿线上挣扎的农民起来造反
　　印度北方邦农民奋起展开夺地斗争
　　楠帕拉等区农民夺回被地主霸占的两万多英亩土地，使反动统治当局十分恐慌
    新华社讯　新德里消息：印度北方邦一些地区的贫苦农民，正在向反动统治阶级进行夺地斗争。
    据印度报纸报道，在北方邦北部巴赫拉伊奇县楠帕拉区，五千名无地的贫苦农民不顾警察的镇压，夺回了大地主霸占的大约二万一千英亩土地。农民还收割了被地主霸占的土地上的庄稼。皮利比特县普兰普尔区的农民，夺回了被地主霸占的一千英亩土地。在勒克瑙附近的乌瑙县，农民也从地主阶级那里夺回了约五百英亩土地。
    在北方邦农村，阶级斗争十分尖锐，封建剥削十分严重。长期以来，封建领主、大地主、大农场主、大商人、政府官员等等，不断地掠夺农民的大量土地，占为己有。
    近来，在饥饿线上挣扎的农民纷纷起来造反，向这些剥削和掠夺者夺回土地。农民的造反行动使反动统治当局十分恐慌。大地主和反动政府勾结，对夺地农民进行残酷镇压。据印度《联系》周刊报道，他们发现无地农民试图占据土地时，立即出动雇佣的大批暴徒，用铁皮粗棍殴打农民，并向农民开枪射击。反动政府还派警察逮捕农民。
    伟大导师毛主席指出：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。”印度北方邦农民的夺地斗争是正义的斗争。不管印度反动政府、封建地主如何残酷镇压，都无法阻挡他们起来和他们的敌人作斗争，以求自己的翻身和解放。
