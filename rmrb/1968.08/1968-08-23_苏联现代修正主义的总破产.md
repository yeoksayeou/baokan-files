In the late hours of August 20, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, under the deception of the masses, mobilized a large number of aircraft, tanks, and ground troops to launch a surprise attack and militarily occupy Czechoslovakia. This barefaced act of armed intervention fully exposed the fascist and ferocious face of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, fully exposed the extreme weakness of the Soviet revisionists, and declared the complete failure of Soviet modern revisionism.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's brazen invasion is the result of the extreme sharpening of contradictions within the entire modern revisionist clique. It is the result of the extreme sharpening of contradictions between American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism over Eastern Europe. It is the result of the collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union to attempt to redivide the world. For a long time, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has had deep contradictions and fierce struggles with the revisionist cliques in Eastern European countries. Since the rise of the Khrushchev revisionist traitor clique, they have shamelessly engaged in a series of dirty deals with American imperialism. The Czechoslovakian revisionist traitor clique followed suit, also attempting to follow in the footsteps of the Soviet revisionists and align with American imperialism. However, the Soviet revisionists regard Eastern Europe as their sphere of influence and do not allow the Czechoslovakian revisionists to directly collude with the Americans. As the internal and external difficulties of the Soviet revisionist clique deepen, the trend of disintegration within the modern revisionist clique becomes increasingly apparent. Recently, the rise of the Dubček revisionist clique in Czechoslovakia is a clear manifestation of this trend. The Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to force the Dubček clique to submit and keep Czechoslovakia under Soviet control, has used a combination of soft and hard tactics against the Dubček clique. They sometimes conduct military exercises to threaten with force, and sometimes hold "Banquet of the Eagle" to lure the Czechoslovakian leaders. However, because the Czechoslovakian revisionist traitor clique wants to directly align with the Americans (including West Germany), the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's threats and inducements have repeatedly failed. In a desperate situation, the Soviet revisionist clique had no choice but to tear off their masks, rallying the Gomułka clique, Ulbricht clique, Kádár clique, and Zhivkov clique, to launch a large-scale attack, staging a farce of a major battle within the modern revisionist clique.

The day after the Soviet revisionist traitor clique invaded Czechoslovakia, they issued a statement through Tass. This is a ridiculous cover-up used by the Soviet revisionist clique to hide their ugly faces.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique claims that the invasion of Czechoslovakia is to "defend" the "achievements of socialism." This is the height of shamelessness! Who was it that surrendered to American imperialism and buried the achievements of socialism in the Soviet Union? Who was it that spread Soviet modern revisionism to Eastern Europe, burying the achievements of socialism in some European countries? Was it not you, the greatest traitors in history? You want to use this banner to deceive the Czechoslovakian people, deceive the Soviet people, and deceive the people of the world. This is absolutely impossible.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique claims that the invasion of Czechoslovakia is "out of concern for strengthening peace" and maintaining the "foundation of European peace." This is sheer imperialist bandit logic. In the past, Hitler's occupation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, and today, American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam, were not all done under the banner of "defending peace"? The teacher has his disciples. The Soviet revisionist clique's lies are nothing but excuses for their struggle with the Americans over Czechoslovakia, nothing but second-hand junk picked up from the imperialists.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique also claims that they took such actions to maintain the "indissoluble unity" of the "brotherly countries" and the "interests of the security of the socialist family of nations." In your revisionist clique's mess, where is there any "indissoluble unity"? It is clearly a web of deceit, backstabbing, and disintegration! You are not building any "socialist family"; you are clearly trying to establish a colonial empire with the Soviet revisionist clique as the hegemon, colluding with the Americans to redivide the world. Anyone who joins this "family" will only be at your mercy and manipulation, otherwise, they will face great difficulties.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has long degenerated into social imperialism. It is the same as the imperialist countries, both colluding with each other and competing with each other. Despite having various conflicts of interest, they are united in their opposition to communism, the people, and revolution. After the Soviet revisionist traitor clique invaded Czechoslovakia, they immediately informed Johnson, vividly outlining their relationship.

At a time when American imperialism is in a state of chaos, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's actions in Czechoslovakia actually gave the Johnson administration a big helping hand.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The peoples of all countries, more than ninety percent of the total population, are always revolutionary and will always support Marxism-Leninism. They will not support revisionism; some may temporarily support it, but they will eventually abandon it. They will gradually awaken and will oppose imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries, and will oppose revisionism."

American imperialism is a paper tiger, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique is a paper tiger, and all reactionaries in the world are paper tigers. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's disgraceful performance further educates the Soviet people, the Czechoslovakian people, and revolutionary people around the world, helping them see more clearly the counter-revolutionary face of the Soviet revisionist clique and its lackeys, and promoting their awakening and revolutionary struggle.

The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stand firmly with the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union, with the revolutionary people of Czechoslovakia, and with the revolutionary people of the world who oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. The Chinese people resolutely support the people of the world in their struggle against American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. The Chinese people resolutely support the proletariat and all revolutionary people in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries ruled by modern revisionist cliques to overthrow the reactionary rule of modern revisionism, seize power back into their own hands, and return their countries to the path of proletarian dictatorship and socialism. We are deeply convinced that such a day will surely come!

### 苏联现代修正主义的总破产

    苏联现代修正主义的总破产
    本报评论员
    八月二十日深夜，苏修叛徒集团，在人民群众受蒙蔽的情况下，出动大量飞机、坦克和地面部队，以突然袭击的方式，对捷克斯洛伐克实行军事占领。这个赤裸裸的武装干涉的行动，充分地暴露了苏修叛徒集团的法西斯狰狞面目，充分暴露了苏修的极度虚弱，宣告了苏联现代修正主义的总破产。
    苏修叛徒集团这次悍然出兵，是整个现代修正主义集团内部矛盾极度尖锐化的结果。是美帝国主义同苏联现代修正主义争夺东欧的矛盾极度尖锐化的结果。是美苏勾结妄图重新瓜分世界引起的结果。长期以来，苏修叛徒集团同东欧国家的修正主义集团之间就存在着深刻的矛盾和激烈的倾轧。自从赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团上台以来，他们就毫不羞耻地同美帝国主义作一系列肮脏的买卖。捷修叛徒集团起而效颦，也想步苏修的后尘，投靠美帝国主义。但苏修却把东欧看作自己的势力范围，不许捷修直接同美帝勾结。随着苏修集团的内外交困的日益加深，现代修正主义集团内部分崩离析的趋势越来越表面化。最近，捷克斯洛伐克杜布切克修正主义集团的上台，就是这种发展趋势的一个明显的表现。苏修领导集团为了迫使杜布切克集团就范，使捷克斯洛伐克继续受制于苏修，对杜布切克集团采取了软硬兼施的种种手段。他们一会儿搞军事演习，进行武力威胁，一会儿摆“鸿门之宴”，迫使捷修头目上钩。但是，由于捷修叛徒集团一心想同美帝（也包括西德）直接挂钩，苏修叛徒集团的威胁利诱遭到了一次又一次的失败。在走投无路的情况之下，苏修集团不得不撕破脸皮，纠集哥穆尔卡集团、乌布利希集团、卡达尔集团、日夫科夫集团，大动干戈，演出了现代修正主义集团大混战的丑剧。
    苏修叛徒集团在出兵捷克斯洛伐克的第二天，通过塔斯社发表了一篇声明。这是苏修集团用来掩盖自己丑恶面目的一块可笑的遮羞布。
    苏修叛徒集团说，出兵捷克斯洛伐克是为了“保卫”“社会主义成果”。真是无耻之尤！究竟是谁投降美帝国主义，葬送了苏联的社会主义成果？又是谁把苏联现代修正主义推销到东欧去，葬送了欧洲一些国家的社会主义成果？不正是你们这一伙历史上最大的叛徒吗！你们想打出这块招牌，来欺骗捷克斯洛伐克人民，欺骗苏联人民，欺骗全世界人民，这是绝对办不到的。
    苏修叛徒集团说，出兵捷克斯洛伐克是“出于关心加强和平”，维护“欧洲和平的基础”。这是彻头彻尾的帝国主义的强盗逻辑。当年，希特勒占领捷克苏台德区，今天，美帝国主义侵略越南，不都是打着“保卫和平”的旗号吗？有其师必有其徒。苏修集团的这套鬼话，不过是苏修同美帝争夺捷克斯洛伐克的一种借口，不过是从帝国主义那里拣来的破烂货。
    苏修叛徒集团还说，他们采取这样的行动是为了“兄弟国家”的“牢不可破的团结”和“社会主义大家庭各国安全的利益”。在你们修正主义集团那个烂摊子里，哪里有什么“牢不可破的团结”，明明是尔虞我诈，勾心斗角，四分五裂！你们哪里是要搞什么“社会主义大家庭”，你们明明是要建立一个以苏修集团为霸主的殖民帝国，同美帝合伙重新瓜分世界。凡是参加这个“大家庭”的，就只有任凭你们的宰割和摆布，否则，就要大难临头。
    苏修叛徒集团早已堕落成为社会帝国主义。它同美帝国主义之间，正同帝国主义国家之间一样，既是相互勾结，又要相互争夺。它们尽管也有着这样那样的利害冲突，但是在反共、反人民、反革命方面则是一致的。苏修叛徒集团在出兵捷克斯洛伐克之后，就马上向约翰逊打招呼，这就活生生地勾划出了它们之间的关系。
  在美帝国主义正处于焦头烂额的情况下，苏修叛徒集团在捷克斯洛伐克的行动，实际上是给约翰逊政府帮了一个大忙。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席早就指出：“各国的人民，占人口总数的百分之九十以上的人民大众，总是要革命的，总是会拥护马克思列宁主义的。他们不会拥护修正主义，有些人暂时拥护，将来终究会抛弃它。他们总会逐步地觉醒起来，总会反对帝国主义和各国的反动派，总会反对修正主义。”
    美帝国主义是纸老虎，苏修叛徒集团是纸老虎，世界上一切反动派统统是纸老虎。苏修叛徒集团这一次丑恶表演，进一步教育了苏联人民、捷克斯洛伐克人民和全世界革命人民，使他们更加看清了苏修集团及其娄罗的反革命面目，促进他们的觉醒和革命斗争。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚定不移地站在苏联革命人民一边，站在捷克斯洛伐克革命人民一边，站在全世界反对帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派的革命人民一边。中国人民坚决支持全世界人民反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的斗争。中国人民坚决支持苏联、捷克斯洛伐克以及其它现代修正主义集团当权的国家的无产阶级和一切革命人民，起来推翻现代修正主义的反动统治，把政权重新掌握在自己手里，使他们的祖国回到无产阶级专政和社会主义的道路上来。我们深信，这样的日子是一定会到来的！
