Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "We must have the proletarian political line in command, and follow the path of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in training technical personnel from among the workers." From our personal experience, we deeply feel that Chairman Mao's instruction is absolutely correct, absolutely brilliant, and absolutely great!

"Political command" or "technical command," "politics first" or "technology first"—this is the focal point of the long-term struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev in industrial and commercial enterprises. It is a matter of which class holds the reins of power in the enterprises. The fallacy of "technology first" is actually a smoke screen that the Chinese Khrushchev has put out to cover up his frenzied opposition to proletarian political command and to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates "technology first," but his real intention is not in the technology. He aims to restore capitalism. Advocating "technology first" inevitably leads to the implementation of the "expert line," allowing some bourgeois "experts" to seize control of the enterprises and suppress the politics of the masses. This is the political trick that the Chinese Khrushchev is playing to restore capitalism.

We insist on proletarian political command and criticize the fallacy of "technology first." This does not mean that we do not need technology; on the contrary, only by emphasizing proletarian politics and carrying out the ideological transformation of the people can we truly reach new heights in technology, and promote the development of technology itself at a speed and scale that capitalist countries can only dream of. Practice has proven that only those revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can be selfless, fearless of hardships, and unafraid of difficulties. They can mobilize the collective wisdom of the masses and make great contributions to production technology. On the other hand, those old bourgeois technical personnel who are shackled by the chains of personal fame and gain not only fail to make significant contributions to production technology but also suppress the creativity of the masses, hinder the development of technology, and cause waste in production. Emphasizing proletarian politics and the role of the revolutionary masses is the key to everything; it will definitely enable us to scale the heights of science and technology and promote the rapid development of production and technology. Emphasizing technology and bourgeois technical "authorities," and adhering to the "expert line," will inevitably hinder the development of technology, resulting in nothing being accomplished. This is the dialectic of life.

The production in our formaldehyde workshop has undergone tremendous changes during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, once again proving this truth.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the capitalist roaders in the factory implemented the "expert line," and the power in our formaldehyde workshop was in the hands of old bourgeois technical personnel. They had serious personal fame and gain thoughts, lacked practical production experience, and looked down upon the masses of workers. We workers had long proposed an important technical innovation measure to produce more formaldehyde for the country, but they thought it was not feasible, with the only reason being that there was no such regulation in the books. In this way, the workers' important suggestion was shelved and suppressed for more than two years.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, after repeated struggles, we proletarian revolutionaries finally seized the leadership of the workshop. We immediately established a "three-in-one" combat team composed of revolutionary workers, revolutionary technical personnel, and revolutionary cadres, and re-examined the technical innovation proposal that the workers had put forward more than two years ago. With the help of old workers from the machine repair workshop, we broke through the technical bottleneck that had not been solved in the past three years in just three days, increasing formaldehyde production by more than 27 percent. This vividly shows that proletarian political command is the bright path to rapid development of production and technology; while the "technology first" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev is to monopolize power by bourgeois technical "authorities," suppress the politics of the proletariat, and lead the development of production and technology into a dead end.

    批臭“技术第一”的资产阶级谬论
    北京维尼纶厂甲醛车间　齐向东
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“要无产阶级政治挂帅，走上海机床厂从工人中培养技术人员的道路。”我们从亲身经历中深深地体会到毛主席的这一指示无比正确！无比英明！无比伟大！
    “政治挂帅”，还是“技术挂帅”，“政治第一”还是“技术第一”，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线在工交企业方面长期斗争的焦点，是关系到哪个阶级掌握企业领导大权的问题。“技术第一”的谬论，实际上是中国赫鲁晓夫为了掩盖其疯狂反对无产阶级政治挂帅，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政而放出的一颗烟幕弹。中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“技术第一”，“醉翁之意不在酒”，在于复辟资本主义。鼓吹“技术第一”，势必推行“专家路线”，让一些资产阶级“专家”掌握企业大权，专工人群众的政。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫阴谋复辟资本主义而耍弄的政治魔术。
    我们坚持无产阶级政治挂帅，批判“技术第一”的谬论，决不意味着我们不要技术；恰恰相反，只有突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化，才能真正在技术上攀登新的高峰，才能促进技术本身以资本主义国家所梦想不到的速度和规模向前迅猛发展。实践证明，只有那些对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠诚的革命工人和革命技术人员，才能不为名，不为利，不畏艰险，不怕困难，才能发挥集体的无穷的智慧，在生产技术上作出巨大贡献。而那些套上个人名利精神枷锁的旧的资产阶级技术人员，不但在生产技术上难以作出重大的贡献，而且必然压制群众的创造，阻碍技术的发展，并给生产造成浪费。突出无产阶级政治，突出革命群众的作用，就一通百通，就一定能够攀登科学技术的高峰，促使生产和技术高速度发展；突出技术，突出资产阶级技术“权威”，坚持“专家路线”，反而必然阻碍技术的发展，结果一事无成。生活的辩证法就是如此。
    我们甲醛车间的生产，在无产阶级文化大革命中发生的巨大变革，再一次证明了这一个真理。
    文化大革命以前，厂里的走资派推行“专家路线”，我们甲醛车间的大权把持在旧的资产阶级技术人员手里。他们个人名利思想相当严重，缺乏生产实践经验，却又看不起工人群众。我们工人为了给国家多生产甲醛，早就提出了一项重要的技术革新措施，但是他们认为不行，唯一的理由是：本本上没有这种规定。就这样，工人们这项重要建议就被打入冷宫，一直压了两年多。
    无产阶级文化大革命中，经过反复的较量，我们无产阶级革命派终于掌握了车间的领导大权。我们立即成立了由革命工人、革命技术人员、革命干部组成的“三结合”战斗小组，重新研究了两年多以前工人们提出的那项增产的技术革新建议，受到重要的启发。我们在修机车间老工人的帮助下，只用三天的时间，就突破了过去三年还没突破的技术难关，使甲醛生产又跃增百分之二十七以上。这生动地说明了：无产阶级政治挂帅，是高速度发展生产和技术的光明大道；而中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“技术第一”，就是要由资产阶级技术“权威”垄断大权，专工人阶级的政，并使生产和技术的发展走进一条死胡同中。
