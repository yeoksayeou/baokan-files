The South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces in the Xining region heavily attacked the enemy's military bases, outposts, and military facilities in Xining City and its surrounding areas from the night of August 17 to the early morning of August 18, inflicting severe losses on the enemy.

In the battle to attack the U.S. communication center area on Ba Zon Mountain, the People's Liberation Armed Forces annihilated 50 U.S. puppet soldiers and destroyed many facilities.

When attacking the U.S. military base in the Cha Fei area, the People's Liberation Armed Forces, after a few minutes of fierce battle, annihilated a U.S. mixed battalion (including two infantry companies, one armored company, and one artillery company) and the command post of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division. In the Ka Song area, the People's Liberation Armed Forces also annihilated many enemy soldiers.

In the south of Xining City, the People's Liberation Armed Forces, after 45 minutes of heroic battle, captured an important enemy outpost—Gui Gong outpost.
