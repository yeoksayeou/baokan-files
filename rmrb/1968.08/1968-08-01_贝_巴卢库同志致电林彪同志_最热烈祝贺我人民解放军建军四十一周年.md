Comrade Bejar Baluku Congratulates Comrade Lin Biao on the 41st Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Liberation Army

New China News Agency, July 31st
Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, received a congratulatory telegram from Comrade Bejar Baluku, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of Albania, on the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To Comrade Lin Biao, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China,

Dear Comrade Lin Biao,

On the occasion of the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of the Albanian people, the officers and soldiers of the Albanian People's Army, and in my personal capacity, extend the warmest revolutionary greetings and most sincere fraternal congratulations to you, and through you, to all the brave officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Over the past 41 years, under the wise and far-sighted leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has gone through a glorious history of struggle.

As a new type of revolutionary army, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has been tempered and armed in the long course of people's wars, in the battles against domestic and foreign enemies, and in the arduous Long March, with the thoughts of Marxism-Leninism and the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong. It has gloriously completed the historical tasks of liberating the people, winning the Chinese revolution, and establishing the People's Republic of China.

During the period of socialist construction, under the leadership of the experienced Chinese Communist Party headed by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has maintained and further carried forward its revolutionary traditions. It has held high the banner of victory of Marxism-Leninism and the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, and faithfully adhered to the revolutionary line of building the army of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, as a revolutionary people's army, has further raised the consciousness and spirit of the proletariat. It vigilantly and faithfully defends the cause of the people and the Party; it is the powerful pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the reliable bulwark of the proletarian dictatorship, revolutionary victory, and socialist construction in the People's Republic of China.

Under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the fraternal Chinese people have achieved brilliant victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly smashing the imperialists, modern revisionists, and domestic counter-revolutionaries' plots to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism in China.

The People's Republic of China has become a great force and a powerful bastion in the world's struggle for revolution, socialism, and national liberation against imperialism and modern revisionism. Today, the People's Republic of China enjoys high international prestige and is respected and praised as a great center of socialist revolution and a heroic flag bearer of Marxism-Leninism.

It is a source of pride for the Albanian people and their army that the great Chinese people and their heroic People's Liberation Army are their noble, loyal friends, true comrades-in-arms, and sincere brothers. They have forged a combat friendship and iron-like unity on the principles of invincible Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. No force in the world can ever break or damage the friendship and unity between our two peoples and armies, forged by our two Marxist-Leninist parties and our great leaders, Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong. Whether in good times or difficult moments, in the struggle to thoroughly smash the imperialist and revisionist plots of aggression, to defend our common cause—the revolutions, socialism, and communism of our two countries—our two peoples and armies will now and in the future always fight side by side.

Dear Comrade Lin Biao, please allow me, on this occasion, to sincerely wish the heroic fraternal Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army new and even greater achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the selfless work of building socialism, strengthening military preparedness, defending the peaceful labor of the Chinese people, and the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

Long live the great revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples and armies of Albania and China!

Bejar Baluku
Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of National Defense
People's Republic of Albania

　　贝·巴卢库同志致电林彪同志
　　最热烈祝贺我人民解放军建军四十一周年
    新华社三十一日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪同志收到了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝·巴卢库同志打来的祝贺中国人民解放军建军四十一周年的电报。贺电全文如下：北京中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪同志亲爱的林彪同志：
    值此中国人民解放军建军四十一周年之际，我代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚人民军的干部和战士，并以我个人的名义向您，并通过您，向兄弟的中国人民和中国人民解放军全体英勇的指战员，致以最热烈的革命敬礼和最衷心的兄弟般的祝贺。
    四十一年来，中国人民解放军在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明的和卓有远见的领导下，经历了光荣的战斗历程。
    中国人民解放军作为一支新型的革命军队，在长期的人民战争的烈火中，经过反对国内外敌人的战斗和惊天动地的长征，用马克思列宁主义的思想和毛泽东同志的学说培育、锻炼和武装自己，光荣地完成了解放人民、赢得中国革命的胜利和建立中华人民共和国的历史任务。
    在社会主义建设时期，中国人民解放军在以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的久经考验的中国共产党的领导下，保持和进一步发扬了自己的革命传统，高举马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的思想的胜利旗帜，忠实地坚持中国共产党的革命的建军路线。中国人民解放军作为一支革命的人民军队，进一步提高了无产阶级的觉悟和精神，它警惕地、忠实地捍卫着人民和党的事业；它是无产阶级文化大革命得以胜利进行的强大支柱，是中华人民共和国无产阶级专政、革命胜利和社会主义建设的可靠的柱石。
    兄弟的中国人民在毛泽东同志直接领导下，团结一致，在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了辉煌的胜利，彻底打击和粉碎了帝国主义、现代修正主义和国内反革命分子企图在中国颠覆无产阶级专政和复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    中华人民共和国，成了革命、社会主义和反对帝国主义及现代修正主义、争取自由和民族独立的世界各国人民民族解放斗争的巨大力量和强大堡垒。今天，中华人民共和国享有崇高的国际威望，它作为社会主义革命的伟大中心和马克思列宁主义的英勇的旗手而受到尊敬和赞扬。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民及其军队感到自豪的是，伟大的中国人民及其英雄的人民解放军是自己尊贵的忠实朋友、真正的战友和真诚的兄弟，并同他们在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则上，结成了战斗的友谊和钢铁般的团结。世界上任何力量都丝毫不能破坏和损害由我们两个马克思列宁主义的党和我们的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志和毛泽东同志所缔造的我们两国人民和军队的这一友谊和团结。不管是在美好的日子里，还是在困难的时刻，在为彻底粉碎帝国主义和修正主义的侵略阴谋、为保卫我们的共同事业——我们两国的革命、社会主义和共产主义，我们两国人民和军队现在和将来永远并肩战斗在一起。
    亲爱的林彪同志，请允许我，借此机会，衷心地祝愿英雄的兄弟的中国人民和中国人民解放军全体指战员，在无产阶级文化大革命中，在为建设社会主义、加强部队战备、保卫中国人民的和平劳动和马克思列宁主义胜利的忘我的工作中，取得新的更加伟大的成就。
    祝阿中两国人民和军队之间的伟大的革命友谊和战斗团结万古长青！
              阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国
