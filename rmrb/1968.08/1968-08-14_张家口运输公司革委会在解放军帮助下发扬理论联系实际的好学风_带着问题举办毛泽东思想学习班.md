The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Conducting study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." The Revolutionary Committee of Zhangjiakou Transportation Company in Hebei Province, with the assistance of the PLA's support-left personnel, has followed Chairman Mao's great teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's important instructions on "studying Chairman Mao's works, learning with problems in mind, applying what is learned actively, combining learning with use, learning what is urgently needed first, seeing immediate results, and focusing on the 'use' aspect." They have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and, in response to new situations and problems in the revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks, have promptly organized "frontline" study classes on Mao Zedong Thought. They have organized broad revolutionary workers to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions, link theory with practice, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and raise their class struggle and two-line struggle consciousness. This has enabled the revolutionary criticism to deepen continuously, pushing the struggle against the enemy forward. The revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the entire company have been increasingly consolidated and developed, and a new situation has emerged in the revolution and production.

The Revolutionary Committee of Zhangjiakou Transportation Company was established in February this year, and the revolutionary and production situation has been getting better and better. In this situation, the revolutionary ranks showed signs of relaxation and complacency. Some workers thought: the capitalist roaders have been overthrown, the power is in our hands, now we should roll up our sleeves and focus on production. The tide of revolutionary criticism began to ebb, there was little criticism and struggle against the exposed capitalist roaders, and fewer study classes were held. The above situation attracted the attention of the Revolutionary Committee and the supporting-left personnel. After discussion, they decided to immediately hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class with the central theme of "Never forget class struggle."

The study class focused on class and class struggle education, guiding everyone to link it with the actual class struggle in the company, and severely criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" by the Chinese Khrushchev. They exposed the series of sabotage activities by a handful of class enemies after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee. The vivid class education made the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the broad revolutionary workers further understand Chairman Mao's profound statements on class and class struggle. They unanimously agreed that only by never forgetting class struggle and never forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat can one truly understand and correctly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. In the study class, everyone seriously studied Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" and his great teachings on "criticizing and repudiating revisionism." They analyzed the new situation of class struggle and clearly saw that seizing power from the capitalist roaders and achieving decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was only the first step of the long march. The enemy will not disappear on its own. If we do not expose the handful of traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks and thoroughly eliminate the influence of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line, the newly born revolutionary power will not be truly consolidated. Therefore, we must carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, criticize and repudiate Chinese Khrushchev and his agents politically, ideologically, and theoretically, overthrow and expose them, and uproot the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their representatives.

Through the extensive organization of study classes, the broad masses have been armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and the entire company quickly launched a high tide of revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks. From the workshops to the offices, from the day shift to the night shift, revolutionary criticism battlefields were set up everywhere, launching fierce attacks on the class enemies, exposing a handful of traitors, spies, and other counter-revolutionaries, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and smashing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao teaches us: being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. After exposing a handful of class enemies, the broad revolutionary workers, without stopping or relaxing, linked those elements with Chinese Khrushchev and his counter-revolutionary revisionist line for criticism. The revolutionary criticism made the class enemies tremble with fear. At this time, a handful of class enemies took the opportunity to raise the banner of so-called "anti-factionalism," attempting to stir up another "civil war" between the two factions of the masses and disrupt the revolutionary criticism.

The Revolutionary Committee and the PLA supporting-left personnel analyzed this new trend of the class enemies and unanimously agreed that to smash the new conspiracies of the class enemies, we must arm the broad workers with Mao Zedong Thought and raise the masses' class consciousness and two-line struggle consciousness. Therefore, they immediately organized another "frontline" study class. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." And "factionalism must be analyzed from a class perspective." The broad masses heightened their class vigilance, recognized that using the slogan of "anti-factionalism" to strip away class content and oppose revolutionary criticism and the cleansing of class ranks was a new trick of the class enemies to attack the proletariat. Everyone followed Chairman Mao's teachings, used the method of class analysis to strip away the enemy's disguise, and expose them in broad daylight. Revolutionary workers angrily pointed out: "The more the class enemies fear revolutionary criticism, the more we must fan the flames of revolutionary criticism, making all class enemies reveal their true colors in the fiery criticism!"

In the "frontline" study class, they carried forward the revolutionary learning style advocated by Chairman Mao, achieving the integration of theory and practice, and learning and applying together. The originally severe opposition between the two revolutionary factions further eliminated the opposing sentiments in their minds, united as one, and jointly fought against the enemy. They quickly exposed the hidden capitalist roaders and traitors who were instigating "civil war" and creating divisions, effectively consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Leaders must be at the forefront of the movement." In the context of deepening the struggle against the enemy and revolutionary criticism, some workers and individual members of the Revolutionary Committee held a cold and discriminatory attitude towards the faction heads and deceived masses who were basically good but made mistakes. Some even demanded that they be lumped together with the bad elements for criticism and struggle.

How should we correctly treat comrades who have made mistakes? The Revolutionary Committee and the PLA supporting-left personnel firmly grasped this issue and promptly organized a "frontline" study class. They studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on "whether to protect or suppress the broad masses of the people is the fundamental difference between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the fundamental difference between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the fundamental difference between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." They deeply understood that how to treat the broad masses of the people, how to treat comrades who have made mistakes, whether to start from the party's principles or personal grudges, whether to be enthusiastic about education or cold and discriminatory, is an important indicator of whether every revolutionary fighter is loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by strictly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions can we accurately and firmly strike at a handful of class enemies. After the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the broad revolutionary workers raised their awareness, they seriously implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, correctly grasped the party's policies, and regarded uniting and winning over class brothers as practical actions to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They adopted different methods to help the faction heads who were deeply deceived and made serious mistakes, providing enthusiastic assistance.

To effectively help and educate the deceived masses and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Revolutionary Committee and the PLA supporting-left personnel specially organized a "frontline" study class for the faction heads who made mistakes and the deceived masses. The study class started with class education and two-line struggle education, always emphasizing the word "loyalty" and focusing on the word "use." They guided everyone to recall bitterness and sweetness, and launched a big criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line. The study class organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Put Down Your Burdens and Start the Machine," guiding everyone to compare with the brilliant deeds of Comrade Tan Zhonglin, find the gap in their two-line struggle consciousness, find the cause in the depths of their souls, find the direction in Chairman Mao's teachings, voluntarily expose their thoughts, criticize their private thoughts, put down their burdens, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the PLA supporting-left personnel also actively sought out the faction heads who made mistakes for heart-to-heart talks, doing thorough and detailed ideological and political work, raising their class consciousness, actively participating in the struggle against the enemy and revolutionary criticism, and together with the broad proletarian revolutionary factions, launched a big exposure, big criticism, and big struggle against the class enemies. This accurately and firmly struck at a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and developing the great situation of revolution and production in the entire company.

　　张家口运输公司革委会在解放军帮助下发扬理论联系实际的好学风
　　带着问题举办毛泽东思想学习班
    广大革命职工活学活用毛主席著作和最新指示，提高了阶级斗争觉悟和两条路线斗争觉悟；革命大批判不断深入，有力地推动了对敌斗争；革命大联合和革命三结合日益巩固和发展
    本报讯　伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”河北省张家口运输公司革委会在解放军某部支左人员的帮助下，遵循毛主席的伟大教导，和林副主席关于“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的重要指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，针对革命大批判和清理阶级队伍中的新情况、新问题，及时举办“火线”毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大革命职工活学活用毛主席一系列最新指示，联系实际，斗私批修，提高阶级斗争和两条路线斗争觉悟，从而使革命大批判不断深入，推动对敌斗争不断向前发展。全公司的革命大联合和革命三结合日益巩固和发展，革命和生产出现了一派崭新景象。念念不忘阶级斗争不停顿地向阶级敌人进攻
    今年二月，张家口运输公司革命委员会成立以后，革命和生产形势越来越好。在这种情况下，革命队伍里出现了松劲麻痹情绪。部分职工认为：走资派打倒了，印把子到手了，这回该腾出手抓生产了。革命大批判的浪潮开始低落，对揪出的走资派很少批斗，学习班也办得少了。上述情况，引起了革委会和驻公司支左人员的重视，他们经过研究，决定立即举办以“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。
    学习班狠抓阶级和阶级斗争教育，并引导大家联系本公司的阶级斗争实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，揭露一小撮阶级敌人在革委会成立后的一系列阴谋破坏活动。活生生的阶级教育，使革委会成员和广大革命职工进一步理解了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的英明论述，一致认为，只有念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，才能真正理解和正确贯彻毛主席的革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。在学习班里，大家认真地学习了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》和关于“斗私，批修”的伟大教导，分析了阶级斗争的新形势，清楚地看到，从走资派手中夺过了权，无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。敌人是不会自行消灭的，如果不把钻进革命队伍的一小撮叛徒、特务和反革命分子揭露出来，不彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的影响，新生的革命政权就不能真正巩固。因此，必须深入持久地开展革命大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人批深批透，批倒批臭，把国民党反动派的残渣余孽和他们的总代表连根拔掉。
    通过大办学习班，用毛泽东思想武装了广大群众的头脑，整个公司迅速掀起了一场革命大批判和清理阶级队伍的高潮。从车间到办公室，从白班到夜班，处处摆开了革命大批判战场，向阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻，把一小撮叛徒、特务和其他反革命分子揭露出来，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。
    阶级敌人越害怕革命大批判越要把大批判烈火烧得更旺
    毛主席教导说：被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。揭露出一小撮阶级敌人后，广大革命职工不歇气、不松劲，把那些家伙与中国赫鲁晓夫及其反革命修正主义路线联系起来进行批判。革命大批判，使阶级敌人胆颤心惊。这时，一小撮阶级敌人乘机打出了所谓“反派性”的幌子，妄图重新挑起两派群众组织的“内战”，干扰革命大批判。
    革委会和解放军支左人员分析了阶级敌人这一新动向，大家一致认识到，要粉碎阶级敌人的新阴谋，必须用毛泽东思想武装广大职工的头脑，提高群众的阶级觉悟和两条路线斗争的觉悟。于是，又立即举办了“火线”学习班。反复学习毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”和“对派性要进行阶级分析。”广大革命群众提高了阶级警惕性，认清了用“反派性”这个抽掉阶级内容的口号，反对革命大批判和清理阶级队伍，是阶级敌人向无产阶级进攻的新花招。大家遵照毛主席的教导，运用阶级分析的方法剥去敌人的伪装，让他们暴露在光天化日之下。革命职工们愤怒地指出：“阶级敌人越害怕革命大批判，我们就越要把革命大批判的烈火烧得更旺，让一切阶级敌人在革命大批判的烈火里统统现出原形！”
    在“火线”学习班里，他们发扬了毛主席亲自倡导的革命学风，做到了理论联系实际，学用结合。原来严重对立的两派革命群众，进一步从思想深处消除了对立情绪，团结一致，共同对敌，很快就揭出隐藏在幕后挑动“内战”、制造分裂的走资派和叛徒，有力地巩固和发展了革命大联合。
    团结一切可以团结的力量稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人
    毛主席教导说：“领导一定要走在运动的前面”在对敌斗争和革命大批判不断深入开展的情况下，一些职工和革委会个别成员，对本质上较好但犯有错误的革命群众组织头头和受蒙蔽的群众抱有冷淡歧视态度，有的甚至要求把他们与坏人拉到一块批斗。
    怎样正确对待犯有错误的阶级兄弟呢？革委会和解放军支左人员紧紧抓住这个课题，及时举办了“火线”学习班，学习了毛主席关于“对广大人民群众是保护还是镇压，是共产党同国民党的根本区别，是无产阶级同资产阶级的根本区别，是无产阶级专政同资产阶级专政的根本区别”的伟大教导，深刻认识到：对广大人民群众采取什么态度，对待犯有错误的革命同志，是从党的原则出发，还是从个人恩怨出发，是热情教育，还是冷淡歧视，这是检验每个革命战士对毛主席革命路线忠不忠的重要标志。只有严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，才能稳准狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人。革委会成员和广大革命职工认识提高后，认真地贯彻毛主席的革命路线，正确地掌握党的政策，他们把团结争取阶级兄弟，当作落实毛主席最新指示的实际行动，对受蒙蔽较深、犯错误较严重的群众组织头头，采取了不同的方法，进行了热情的帮助。
    为了有效地帮助和教育受蒙蔽的群众，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，革委会和解放军支左人员还专门举办了一期犯错误的群众组织头头和受蒙蔽群众参加的“火线”学习班。学习班从阶级教育和两条路线斗争教育入手，始终突出一个“忠”字，狠抓一个“用”字，启发大家忆苦思甜，对中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线展开大批判。学习班组织大家学习了毛主席的《放下包袱，开动机器》光辉著作，引导大家对照门合同志的光辉事迹，从两条路线斗争觉悟上找差距，从灵魂深处找原因，从毛主席教导中找方向，自觉地亮思想，斗私心，放包袱，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。革委会成员和解放军支左人员还主动找犯有错误的革命群众组织头头进行谈心，做深入细致的思想政治工作，提高他们的阶级觉悟，积极投入对敌斗争和革命大批判，与广大无产阶级革命派一起向阶级敌人展开了大揭发，大批判，大斗争，从而稳、准、狠地打击了一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，巩固了无产阶级专政，发展了全公司的革命和生产的大好形势。
