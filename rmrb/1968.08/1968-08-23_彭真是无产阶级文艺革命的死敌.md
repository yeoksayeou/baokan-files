Class struggle in the field of culture and art has been fiercely and heart-rendingly waged over the past decade. In this fierce struggle, the ambitious and scheming Peng Zhen has been a key figure in the counter-revolutionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

At several crucial junctures in the revolution of Peking opera, Peng Zhen either sat in command or personally joined the battle, swinging one big stick after another against Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art, and against the proletarian revolutionary forces advocating theatrical revolution, in a desperate attempt to block the historical tide of the proletarian cultural revolution.

The first big stick Peng Zhen swung was the "Better Slow Than Messy" theory.

After the nation's liberation, we proletarians seized political power. The question of whether to eliminate the stinking pile of old literature and art left behind by the reactionary regime, and whether to revolutionize the old operas dominated by emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, was a major issue concerning the consolidation of proletarian dictatorship. At that time, the military control authorities took some decisive revolutionary measures, first banning a batch of extremely reactionary and obscene old Peking operas such as "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother," "The Pot of Ink," and "The Big Coffin." The ambitious Peng Zhen, fearing that these filthy things might disappear, quickly jumped out to protect them, throwing out the slogan "Better Slow Than Messy." In December 1949, at a meeting of cultural workers in Beijing, he loudly declared: "The Military Control Committee's Cultural Section banned dozens of plays at once, which was wrong!" He said that old operas had been performed for "many years," and that "performing them over and over again had not stopped the revolution," so the "standards should be loose," "not too strict," "can be careless," "slow is okay, we should better slow than messy!"

What a "Better Slow Than Messy"!

Peng Zhen's "slow" means that we should yield to the emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, and all kinds of ghosts and monsters on stage, treating them as sacred objects to be worshipped, not allowing a single hair to be touched; Peng Zhen's "not messy" means "no revolution allowed"! We need to eliminate old literature and art that do not suit the new politics and economy, and reform the old culture left over from thousands of years ago. Without "mess," without breaking the old order, without what Lu Xun called "striking and shaking," it is impossible. There is order after chaos, and chaos leads to order. "Mess" is revolution. Peng Zhen denounced this revolutionary "mess" as "wrong," and like a pseudo-foreigner, he brandished the "civilization stick," not allowing us to rebel against the old opera stage; but for the rampant reactionary literature and art, to mess up our socialist society, he was indifferent, wanting us to be "careless" and "more careless"! Comparing the two, isn't the essence of Peng Zhen's "Better Slow Than Messy" theory clear as day?

Peng Zhen's second big stick was the "Division of Labor" theory.

In 1958, as the socialist revolution deepened, some revolutionary comrades in the Peking opera circle began to experiment with performing modern revolutionary plays. Seeing the situation was not in his favor, Peng Zhen quickly jumped out to block the way, throwing out the "Division of Labor" theory. He repeatedly spread the idea that "Peking opera performing modern plays is unnatural, and traditional programs should be done more." "Peking opera is naturally about describing history, why not make use of its strengths?"

Peng Zhen vigorously promoted the "Division of Labor" theory, supposedly because Peking opera has the "strength" of "naturally describing history." We cannot help but ask, what kind of "history" does old Peking opera "describe"? As early as 1944, Chairman Mao pointed out: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (and in all old literature and art that are separated from the people) the people have become dregs." Peng Zhen, however, called this inversion of history "naturally describing history" and wanted people to fully develop this "strength." Isn't this an attempt to keep the inversion of history on stage forever? Of course, Peking opera has its own artistic methods and characteristics. However, any artistic form serves a certain political content under certain historical conditions and must change with the development of history and the change of content. Peking opera art, with the development of history and the fundamental change of the social system, must inevitably undergo this revolutionary change. Peng Zhen exaggerated the artistic characteristics of old Peking opera and other traditional operas, treating their programs as sacred and inviolable, not allowing people to touch or move them, and using "making use of strengths" as an excuse to talk about "division of labor," saying that Peking opera is not suitable for performing modern revolutionary plays. His purpose was to refuse to reform old Peking opera in a socialist way, so as to use old Peking opera as a tool for their capitalist restoration propaganda.

Peng Zhen's third big stick was the "Two-Legged Walk" theory.

In 1964, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing personally led revolutionary cultural warriors to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launched a fierce assault on several of the most stubborn fortresses—Peking opera, ballet, symphony, and so on. In this situation, Peng Zhen sensed that the end was near for the emperors, scholars, beauties, and dead foreigners on the old stage, so he quickly jumped out to resist. He threw out the "Two-Legged Walk" theory, saying: "Peking opera must walk on two legs, both reflecting modern life and performing historical plays." He also said: "Wait until modern plays pass inspection, then do historical plays, in short, walk on two legs!"

We ask: Can the so-called "historical plays" used by the Peng Zhen clique to distort workers, peasants, and soldiers, and attack the socialist system, coexist with the revolutionary modern plays used by the proletariat to propagate socialism? Can they walk together? No, absolutely not! We know that if we compare revolutionary modern plays with Peng Zhen's counter-revolutionary so-called "historical plays" to two legs, these are obviously the legs of two classes. Revolutionary modern plays belong to the proletariat, and they want to march forward to communism; the other leg belongs to the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, and it wants to retreat to the dark world of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. These two opposing "legs" cannot coexist peacefully, nor can they "walk" together on the same "road"! The Peng Zhen clique's so-called "Two-Legged Walk" is precisely the reflection in literature and art of their reactionary fallacy of "synthesizing two into one" and "peaceful coexistence" in philosophy and politics.

What "Two-Legged Walk," it is purely a big conspiracy! At the same time as proposing this slogan, Peng Zhen said: "Old plays must be performed, otherwise the art will not be preserved," while revolutionary modern plays are "just a fad, and when this fad passes, traditional plays will still be performed!" He said it so clearly, "Old plays must be performed," and performed until "communism," while revolutionary modern plays are just "a fad," to be dealt with for a while and then put away. This proves that Peng Zhen's "Two-Legged Walk" is a complete lie, a fraud, a soft knife to strangle revolutionary modern plays. They want to use this soft knife to kill proletarian revolutionary literature and art, allowing reactionary old Peking opera, emperors, scholars, beauties to continue to occupy the stage, serving their reactionary politics!

Peng Zhen's fourth big stick was the infamous "Establish Before Destroy" theory.

The flourishing of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution signaled the imminent doom of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen still tried to struggle desperately, repeatedly throwing out the reactionary "Establish Before Destroy" theory. In September 1965, at the national conference of cultural bureau directors, he shouted hoarsely: "Without establishment, there is no real destruction." He also shamelessly inserted this black phrase into the counter-revolutionary program "February Outline" he personally drafted, which was distributed nationwide by the Chinese Khrushchev, poisoning the entire country, in an attempt to use this to suppress the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao taught us: Reactionary culture serves imperialism and the feudal class and is something that should be overthrown. Without overthrowing this thing, no new culture can be established. Without destruction, there is no establishment; without blocking, there is no flow; without stopping, there is no progress. Their struggle is a life-and-death struggle.

Destruction before establishment is the dialectics of revolution. Destruction is revolution, "Destruction first, and establishment is within it." "Only by destroying the old and rotten things can new and healthy things be built."

The "Establish Before Destroy" theory is a counter-revolutionary slogan of the bourgeoisie on the eve of their doom, resisting the proletariat. They deliberately invert the relationship between "destruction" and "establishment," canceling the priority of destruction, thus canceling the revolution and protecting all rotten things.

The "Establish Before Destroy" theory seems to support both "establishment" and "destruction," but in reality, Peng Zhen makes all kinds of difficulties and resolutely resists revolutionary "destruction," and hates revolutionary "establishment" to the bone, stubbornly opposing it. Revolutionary model operas like "Sha Jianhuai" and "The Red Lantern" were established in the process of "destruction," and Peng Zhen viciously said: "What model operas, I am a member of the five-person group, and I do not acknowledge them!" For the old, he does not allow revolution; for the new, he does not acknowledge it. This is the essence of Peng Zhen's "Establish Before Destroy" theory, which reveals a hideous image of a "pseudo-foreigner"!

The "Establish Before Destroy" theory that Peng Zhen advocates, and the "Better Slow Than Messy" theory, "Division of Labor" theory, "Two-Legged Walk" theory, and so on that he repeatedly promotes, may have different expressions and tricks, but their essence is the same: do not allow revolution, suppress revolution!

Peking opera is an influential and representative ancient opera form. It has accumulated thousands of old plays that have served the reactionary ruling classes of successive dynasties, making it the most stubborn fortress in the old art group. The ambitious and scheming Peng Zhen and his accomplices deeply understand that once this Peking opera fortress is breached, all other opera forms will undergo great qualitative changes, and their literary and artistic positions for manufacturing counter-revolutionary restoration public opinion will be in danger of complete loss. Therefore, defending this reactionary fortress has become a counter-revolutionary strategic measure for the bourgeois headquarters, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, to resist the proletarian cultural revolution.

Reviewing the history of Peking opera reform over the past decade, it is a history of class struggle filled with the clash of swords and spears. Almost in every stage of Peking opera reform, the vanguard of the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Zhen, would swing his big stick and fight fiercely, madly resisting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art, committing heinous crimes. Peng Zhen is the enemy of the proletarian cultural revolution!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    彻底批判修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台
    彭真是无产阶级文艺革命的死敌
    马联玉　姚欣　金和增
    文化艺术领域里的阶级斗争，十几年来一直激烈地、惊心动魄地进行着。在这场激烈的斗争中，大野心家、大阴谋家彭真是中国赫鲁晓夫反革命阵线上一员干将。
    彭真在京剧革命的几个重要关头，或坐帐指挥，或赤膊上阵，向着毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，向着坚持戏剧革命的无产阶级革命派，疯狂地抡出了一条又一条的大棒，妄图阻挡无产阶级文艺革命的历史潮流。
    彭真抡出的第一条大棒，叫“宁慢勿乱”论。
    全国解放以后，我们无产阶级取得了政权。对反动政权遗留下来的一大摊子散发着冲天秽气的旧文艺要不要清除，对帝王将相、才子佳人统治的旧戏曲要不要革命，这是关系到无产阶级专政能不能巩固的重大问题。当时的军管部门对旧文化采取了一些果断的革命措施，首先禁演了一批如《四郎探母》、《乌盆记》、《大劈棺》之类极端反动淫秽的旧京剧。大野心家彭真惟恐这些乌七八糟的东西绝种，赶紧跳出来保护，抛出了“宁慢勿乱”的口号。一九四九年十二月，他在北京文艺干部报告会上大肆叫嚣：“军管会文艺处一下子禁了几十出戏，是错误的！”说什么旧戏演了“多少年了”，“演来演去也没能阻止革命”，因此“尺度要宽”、“不要过严”，“可以马虎一些”，“慢一点没关系，我们要宁慢勿乱！”
    好一个“宁慢勿乱”！
    彭真的“宁慢”，就是要我们对舞台上的帝王将相、才子佳人以及形形色色的牛鬼蛇神拱手让步，把它们当作神物供养起来，不许触动一根毫毛；彭真的“勿乱”，就是“不准革命”！我们要革除不适应新的政治新的经济的旧文艺，要改革几千年遗留下来的旧文化，不“乱”，不打破旧秩序，不象鲁迅说的“施行袭击，令其动摇”，是不可能的。有乱才有治，乱而后治。“乱”就是革命。彭真把这种革命的“乱”，斥之为“错误的”，他象假洋鬼子一样，挥舞着“文明棒”，不准我们造旧戏曲舞台的反；而对于反动的文艺大肆泛滥，要把我们的社会主义社会搅“乱”，他却安之若素，要我们“马虎一些”再“马虎一些”！两相对照，彭真的“宁慢勿乱”论的实质，不是昭然若揭了吗？
    彭真的第二条大棒，是“分工”论。
    一九五八年，随着社会主义革命的深入发展，京剧界的一部分革命同志开始了演革命现代戏的尝试。彭真见势不妙，赶紧跳出来阻挡，抛出了一个“分工”论。他不止一次地散布：“京剧演现代戏四不象，应当多搞传统节目。”“京剧还是描写历史自然，为什么不发挥其特长呢？”
    彭真大肆宣扬“分工”论，据说是因为京剧有“描写历史自然”的“特长”。我们不禁要问，旧京剧“描写”的是什么样的“历史”？早在一九四四年，毛主席就英明指出：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓”。对这种历史的颠倒，彭真却称之为“描写历史自然”，还要人们把这种“特长”大加发挥，这不是妄图把舞台上历史的颠倒永远颠倒下去，又是什么呢？
    当然，京剧有它自己的艺术手段、艺术特色。但是，任何一种艺术形式，都是在一定的历史条件下为一定的政治内容服务的，都要随着历史的发展、内容的变迁而有所弃取，有所演变。京剧艺术随着历史的发展，随着社会制度的根本变革，也必然要出现这种革命的变革。彭真极力夸张旧京剧及其它传统戏曲的艺术特点，把它们的程式说成是神圣不可侵犯的东西，不准人们碰，不准人们动，并用“发挥特长”做借口，搞什么“分工”，说什么京剧不适合演革命现代戏，其目的就是拒绝对旧京剧进行社会主义改造，以便把旧京剧作为他们复辟资本主义的舆论工具。
    彭真的第三条大棒，叫做“两条腿走路”论。
    一九六四年，我们敬爱的江青同志，亲自率领革命的文艺战士高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向几个最顽固的堡垒——京剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响音乐等发起了勇猛的冲锋。在这种情况下，彭真预感到旧舞台上的帝王将相、才子佳人、死人洋人的末日即将到来，于是他赶紧跳出来顽抗。抛出了“两条腿走路”论。他说：“京剧一定要两条腿走路，既要反映现代生活，又要演历史戏。”又说：“等现代戏过了关，再搞历史剧，总之是两条腿走路！”
    试问：彭真之流用以歪曲工农兵，攻击社会主义制度的所谓“历史戏”，与无产阶级用来宣传社会主义的革命现代戏，能够同时并存么？同时走路么？不能，绝对不能！我们知道，如果把革命现代戏与彭真的反革命的所谓“历史戏”比成两条腿，这显然是两个阶级的腿。革命现代戏是无产阶级的，它要向前迈，迈向共产主义；而另一条腿却是地主阶级、资产阶级的，它要向后退，退回到半封建半殖民地的黑暗世界去。这两条敌对的“腿”绝不能和平共处，更不能尔合彼谐地“走”在同一条“路”上！彭真之流的所谓“两条腿走路”，正是他们哲学上的“合二而一”与政治上的“和平共处”反动谬论在文艺上的反映。
    什么“两条腿走路”，纯粹是个大阴谋！就在提出这个口号的同一个时期内，彭真说：“老戏要演，不演老戏艺术保存不下来”，而革命的现代戏却是“一阵风，这阵风过去，还是演传统戏！”说得多么清楚，“老戏要演”，而且要演到“共产主义”，而革命现代戏不过是“一阵风”，应付一阵就可以收起来了。这就证明彭真提出的“两条腿走路”是十足的谎话，是骗局，是扼杀革命现代戏的软刀子。他们妄想用这把软刀子把无产阶级革命文艺杀死，让反动的旧京剧，让帝王将相、才子佳人继续霸占舞台，为他们的反动政治服务！
    彭真的第四条大棒，就是臭名昭著的“先立后破”论。
    无产阶级文化大革命的蓬勃兴起，宣告了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮最大的走资派的灭顶之灾即将到来。但是反革命修正主义分子彭真，还妄图垂死挣扎，一次又一次地抛出了反动的“先立后破”论。一九六五年九月，他在全国文化厅局长会议上声嘶力竭地叫喊：“不立不破，没有立，就没有真正的破。”并且将这句黑话明目张胆地塞在他亲手炮制的反革命纲领《二月提纲》中，由中国赫鲁晓夫批发全党，流毒全国，妄图以此镇压轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    毛主席教导我们：反动文化是替帝国主义和封建阶级服务的，是应该被打倒的东西，不把这种东西打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。
    不破不立是革命的辩证法。破就是革命，“破字当头，立也就在其中了。”“只有破坏旧的腐朽的东西，才能建设新的健全的东西。”
    “先立后破”论，是资产阶级处在灭亡前夕对抗无产阶级的一个反革命口号。他们故意颠倒“破”与“立”的关系，取消了破字当头，也就取消了革命，保护了一切腐朽的东西。
    “先立后破”论表面上仿佛既赞成“立”也赞成“破”，实际上，彭真对革命的“破”，百般刁难，竭力抗拒，对于革命的“立”，恨之入骨，顽固为敌。《沙家浜》、《红灯记》等革命样板戏在“破”中立起来了，彭真恶狠狠地说：“什么样板戏，我是五人小组的，我就不承认！”对旧的，不准革命，对新的，不予承认，这就是彭真的“不立不破”论的实质，它活现出一副“假洋鬼子”的丑恶形象来！
    彭真所宣扬的“不立不破”论，和他所一再鼓吹的什么“宁慢勿乱”论，“分工”论，“两条腿走路”论等等，说法不一，花样有异，但实质是一个，就是：不准革命，压制革命！
    京剧是一个有影响、有代表性的古老剧种。它积累了数以千计的为历代反动统治阶级服务的旧剧目，是旧艺术群里的一个最顽固的堡垒。大野心家、大阴谋家彭真及其同伙深深懂得，一旦京剧这个堡垒被突破，其他剧种都要引起伟大的质的变革，他们赖以制造反革命复辟舆论的文艺阵地就有全部失去的危险。所以，死守这座反动堡垒，就成为以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部对抗无产阶级文艺革命的一个反革命的策略措施。
    回顾十几年来京剧改革的历史，是一幕幕刀光剑影的阶级斗争史，几乎在京剧改革的每一个阶段，中国赫鲁晓夫的急先锋彭真都要抡起大棒，大打出手，丧心病狂地对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，犯下了滔天大罪。彭真是无产阶级文艺革命的死敌！
