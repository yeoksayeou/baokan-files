New York, August 4 (Xinhua) - Thousands of people in New York City held a massive demonstration on August 3 to protest the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. The U.S. reactionary ruling clique, terrified, dispatched large numbers of police to brutally suppress the demonstration, fully exposing their paper tiger nature and fear of the American people.

In the afternoon of August 3, thousands of demonstrators chanting slogans against the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam marched in three columns to Times Square for a large rally. After the rally, they held a massive demonstration against the war.

The demonstrators held up signs protesting the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. Some also held up flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, expressing their strong support for the Vietnamese people. Some demonstrators held up signs demanding the disarmament of reactionary military police suppressing the black struggle, expressing their support for the just struggle of black people in the United States.

After marching through the heart of New York City, the demonstration surrounded a U.S. military base within the city. The entire street where the base is located was cordoned off. The demonstrators shouted, "Hell no, we won't go!" showing their strong will to oppose the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, terrifying the U.S. military authorities in the base, who tightly shut the gates.

The terrified U.S. reactionary ruling clique dispatched large numbers of mounted police to brutally charge the demonstrators and made mass arrests. However, the demonstrators were fearless. They shouted at the police, "Nazis!" strongly condemning the police's fascist atrocities.

    新华社四日讯　纽约消息：纽约市群众数千人三日举行反对美帝侵越战争的大示威。美国反动统治集团竟然出动大批警察进行疯狂的镇压，充分暴露了它们害怕美国人民的纸老虎本质。
    三日下午，数千名示威群众高呼反对美帝侵越战争的口号，分三路列队到“时报广场”集合，举行了声势浩大的群众大会，会后，举行了反对侵越战争的大示威。
    示威群众高举着反对侵越战争的标语牌，有些人还高举着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，表示对越南人民的大力支持。有的示威者高举标语牌，要求解除镇压黑人斗争的反动军警的武装，表示他们对美国黑人正义斗争的声援。
    示威队伍在浩浩荡荡地经过了纽约市中心之后，包围了纽约市内的一处美军营房，在这个营房所在的整个街区布置了纠察线。示威者高呼“决不，我们决不去（越南）”，显示了美国人民反对侵越战争的强烈的意志，吓得这个营房的美军当局紧紧关闭了大门。
    被示威群众吓破了胆的美国反动统治集团竟然出动大批骑警向示威群众进行野蛮的冲击，并进行大规模的逮捕。但是，示威者毫不畏惧，他们对着警察，高呼：“纳粹”，强烈谴责警察的法西斯暴行。
