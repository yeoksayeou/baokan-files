	Uruguay: Two Million Protest Against Student Killing
	Argentina and Chile: Workers and Teachers Strike

	New Xinhua News Agency, August 14th: Workers and teachers in Argentina and Chile have been continuously fighting for improved working conditions and living standards.

	On the 13th, three thousand workers at the French-owned Kayser automobile factory in Argentina held a demonstration to protest the factory owner's dismissal of workers who participated in a strike the previous day. The workers had gone on strike to demand better working conditions. The authorities sent a large number of police to brutally suppress the demonstrators, using tear gas and batons, and even deploying armored vehicles to block the roads. However, the demonstrators, undeterred by the violence, retaliated with stones and engaged in a large-scale struggle with the police. The workers also flooded the main streets of Córdoba, the capital of Córdoba Province, holding a demonstration march.

	Over a thousand workers from five factories in Santiago, the capital of Chile, recently announced an indefinite strike to demand wage increases. More than ten thousand primary school teachers in Santiago Province went on strike for two consecutive days, on the 12th and 13th, demanding that the government pay the salaries owed to them this year.

	New Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: Montevideo: On the 14th, two hundred thousand students and workers in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo held a massive demonstration march to protest the reactionary government's shooting of a university student.

	The student was shot and injured by police during a demonstration against the Uruguayan government's suppression of students on the 12th and died from his injuries in the morning of the 14th. The Uruguayan government, fearing that this bloody crime would provoke public outrage, ordered a strict news blackout, prohibiting newspapers and radio stations from reporting it. Despite this, the news spread throughout the city in just a few minutes. Upon hearing the news of the student's killing by reactionary police, students at the University of Montevideo immediately went on strike. Several thousand university students angrily took to the main streets, including "18 de Julio Avenue," to hold a demonstration. Workers from the capital's industrial areas also gathered in groups to protest against the government, joining the students in the demonstration march. The demonstrators held up banners denouncing the reactionary government's atrocities and calling for "freedom." Panicked, the Uruguayan government immediately mobilized a large number of police forces to maintain strict security and ordered the closure of all secondary schools in an attempt to prevent larger-scale popular resistance struggles.

    阿根廷法资凯塞汽车工厂三千名工人十三日举行示威，抗议厂主无理解雇参加十二日罢工的工人。这些工人是为了要求改善工作条件而举行罢工的。当局派出大批警察对示威工人进行野蛮镇压，警察使用了催泪瓦斯和警棍，甚至出动了装甲车，封锁道路。但是，示威工人不畏强暴，用石块还击，同警察展开了大规模的搏斗。工人们还涌向科尔多瓦省首府科尔多瓦市的主要大街，举行示威游行。
    智利首都圣地亚哥五家工厂的一千多名工人最近宣布举行不定期罢工，要求增加工资。智利圣地亚哥省的一万名小学教师十二日和十三日连续两天举行罢教，要求政府支付今年拖欠的工资。
    新华社十五日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚两万名学生和工人十四日举行声势浩大的示威游行，抗议反动当局枪杀一名大学生的血腥暴行。
    这个大学生是在十二日反对乌拉圭当局镇压学生的示威中被警察开枪打伤的，在十四日上午因伤重死亡。乌拉圭政府害怕这一血腥罪行引起群众的愤怒，下令严密封锁消息，不准报纸和电台报道。尽管这样，这个消息还是在几分钟之内就传遍了全城。蒙得维的亚大学生在听到反动警察杀害学生的消息后，立即举行罢课。好几千名大学生愤怒地涌向主要街道“七月十八日大街”，举行示威。首都工业区的工人们也成群结队地走上街头，向当局表示抗议，他们和学生一起举行了示威游行。示威群众高举着标语牌，上面写着谴责反动当局暴行和“要自由”等口号。惊慌失措的乌拉圭当局，立即动员了大批警察部队，严密戒备，同时还下令关闭所有中学，企图防止更大规模的群众反抗斗争。
