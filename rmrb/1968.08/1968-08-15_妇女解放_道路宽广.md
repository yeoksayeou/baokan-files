Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: “The women of China are a great human resource. This resource must be tapped, to struggle for the building of a great socialist country.” The broad masses of laboring women in Qiliying People’s Commune have felt from their own experience that this great human resource of Chinese women can only be fully tapped after the establishment of the people’s commune.

During the three years of difficulty, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents carried out a frenzied strangulation of the people’s commune. Many welfare undertakings that were established to liberate women were ruthlessly slashed. The broad masses of laboring women in Qiliying People’s Commune, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, have waged a tenacious struggle against these evil forces, enabling collective welfare undertakings to develop normally. This has created the conditions for us to participate in collective labor and in social and political life. Now, in every production brigade here, there are flour-milling plants. One sack of grain delivered to the plant can be exchanged for a sack of flour in no time. At night, when the electric lights are turned on and we sit at the sewing machine, it takes no more than the time to have a meal to sew a small garment for the children. Most of the women have been freed from sewing and grinding chores and are actively participating in field labor. The attendance rate of women in the entire commune is always over 85 percent. This is a famous cotton-producing area, and scientific management of cotton fields is our women’s mainstay. Of the more than 400 peasant technicians who make up the “pest-reporting network,” we women account for two-thirds.

The laboring women of Qiliying Commune are no longer concerned with trivial matters at the kitchen stove or with the clothes and food of their husbands and children. We are concerned with state affairs. Women’s enthusiasm for participating in social and political struggles has greatly increased. In the entire commune, half of the cadres guiding the study of Chairman Mao’s works, half of the propagandists, and half of the activists in the study of Chairman Mao’s works are women. Some production brigades have launched voluntary labor competitions among “Red Girls” and “Red Sisters.” The spirit of communism, which is selfless and devoted to the interests of others, has been greatly fostered among the women.

　　妇女解放  道路宽广
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”我们七里营人民公社的广大劳动妇女，从切身经历中感到，中国妇女的这种伟大的人力资源，只有在成立人民公社后，才能被充分发掘出来。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，在三年困难时期，对人民公社进行了疯狂的扼杀，许多为解放妇女而兴办的福利事业，被大杀大砍。我们七里营人民公社的广大劳动妇女，和贫下中农一起，同这种恶势力进行过顽强的斗争，使集体福利事业得到正常的发展，为我们创造了参加集体劳动、参加社会政治生活的条件。现在我们这里队队有面粉加工厂，把一袋粮食送到加工厂，马上就能换回一袋面粉；晚上，扭开电灯坐在缝纫机前，用吃顿饭的工夫，就能为孩子缝一件小衣服。大部分妇女已从针线、碾磨中解放出来，积极参加田间劳动。全公社妇女的出勤率经常都在百分之八十五以上。这里是著名的产棉区，科学管理棉田，我们妇女是主力军。四百多名农民技术员组成的“虫情测报网”，我们妇女占三分之二。
    七里营公社的劳动妇女，现在关心的不再是锅台边的琐事，丈夫孩子的吃穿，我们关心的是国家大事。妇女们参加社会政治斗争的积极性大大提高。全公社学习毛主席著作的辅导员、宣传员、学习毛主席著作积极分子，我们妇女占一半。有的生产队开展了“红姑娘”、“红大嫂”的义务劳动竞赛，妇女们毫不利己专门利人的共产主义风格，大大树立起来了。　　　　　刘庄大队贫农女社员　边秀英
