In the revolutionary old base area of Ruijin, which was personally established by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary masses have a glorious tradition of supporting the army. Today, they love the People's Liberation Army as sincerely as they loved the Red Army in the past.

The sun rises in the east, shining upon the land;
The water from Hongjing Well is sweet and clear;
We offer cups of well water to our dear comrades,
Each cup of well water expresses our deep affection;
We follow the great leader Chairman Mao,
With loyalty and dedication, we strive for the revolution.

The people of Shazhouba, where Chairman Mao once worked and lived, often sing this heartfelt mountain song filled with sincere enthusiasm.

In early March of this year, a propaganda team from a certain unit, sent to Ruijin to support the left, came to Shazhouba to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions. As soon as the team entered the village, the entire village buzzed with excitement!

At this moment, an elderly revolutionary with white hair, carrying a yoke with two buckets of Hongjing Well water, walked briskly over. He put down the yoke, tightly grasped the hands of the PLA soldiers, and said excitedly, "Comrades, the people of Shazhouba have been eagerly awaiting you!" The old man, full of passion, took out fine porcelain bowls specially used for entertaining guests, filled them with Hongjing Well water, and offered them to the comrades of the PLA. He also recounted the glorious deeds of Chairman Mao personally digging the well in Shazhouba in the past.

The PLA soldiers, with hearts full of excitement, took the well water with both hands and shouted enthusiastically, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" They gratefully said, "After drinking a sip of Hongjing Well water, the bond between the military and the people runs deep. We will carry on the fine traditions of the Red Army and remain revolutionary to the end!"

After the PLA support unit arrived in Ruijin, the revolutionary workers of the Ruijin County Clock and Bicycle Repair Cooperative discussed what gifts to present to welcome the PLA. The leader of the revolutionary mass organization and young worker Liu Nianxiu, gazing at the portrait of Chairman Mao, said excitedly, "The people of our old base area deeply feel that Chairman Mao is the most beloved, and the PLA is the best. We will express our loyalty to Chairman Mao by making badges to welcome our comrades in the PLA." Everyone unanimously agreed to quickly and well make a badge with the inscription, "Sunflowers forever facing the red sun, loyalty to Chairman Mao," to present to the PLA.

There were no steel molds for making the badges, so the workers found a steel column and drew the blueprint on it, carving it with a file one stroke at a time. After the mold was made, there was no stamping machine, so the workers used other machines as substitutes. Everyone worked tirelessly, and the next day, the golden badges of Chairman Mao were finally made. Everyone, full of passion, presented the badges to the comrades of the PLA.

Recently, Yang Meiying, a poor peasant from the Juilin Brigade of Yeping Commune, built a new house with the help of the production team. Yang Meiying was so happy that she told everyone, "With Chairman Mao, our poor family can build this new house! We must thank Chairman Mao and wish Chairman Mao a long life!" One day, she heard that not far from her home, Old Huang was repairing his house, and the two PLA soldiers living with Old Huang had no place to stay. She thought that the PLA soldiers were comrades sent by Chairman Mao, and with Chairman Mao and the PLA, the poor and lower-middle peasants have today's happy life. She decided to give her new house to the PLA soldiers. She went to discuss with Old Huang and, fearing that the soldiers might not go, moved their belongings to the new house while the two PLA soldiers were out. In the evening, the two PLA soldiers returned. Yang Meiying led the two comrades to the new house. Above the door hung a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, and on either side were quotations from Chairman Mao: "The military and the people are united as one, see who can defeat us!" Yang Meiying enthusiastically said to the two PLA soldiers, "Comrades! You should live here and not leave!" Yang's deep love for the PLA moved the two soldiers. They stood together with Yang in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, jointly wishing the great leader Chairman Mao a long life!

　　瑞金人民热爱子弟兵
    在毛主席亲手创建的革命老根据地瑞金，革命群众有着光荣的拥军传统。今天，他们象热爱当年的红军一样，衷心热爱人民解放军。
    东方的太阳照大地，红井水啊甜又清；
    捧杯井水献亲人，杯杯井水表深情；
    紧跟领袖毛主席，赤胆忠心干革命。
    毛主席当年工作和生活过的沙洲坝人民经常唱着这首充满诚挚热情的山歌。
    今年三月初，来瑞金支左的某部毛泽东思想宣传队到沙洲坝宣传毛主席的最新指示。队伍刚进村，整个村子就沸腾起来了！
    这时一位白发苍苍的革命老人，肩挑一担红井水，迈着健步走了过来，他把水担放下，紧紧地握住解放军同志的手，激动地说：“亲人啊，我们沙洲坝人民多么盼望你们啊！”老人满怀激情地拿出专门招待客人用的细瓷碗，把红井水满满地盛在碗里，一碗一碗地捧给亲人解放军，并且向解放军讲述当年毛主席亲手在沙洲坝挖井的光辉事迹。
    解放军同志怀着激动的心情，双手接过红井水，纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们感激地说：“喝了一口红井水，军民鱼水情谊深，继承红军好传统，革命到底不变心！”
    人民解放军支左部队到瑞金后，瑞金县钟表单车修配合作社的革命职工就讨论用什么礼物来迎接解放军。革命群众组织负责人、青年工人刘年秀凝视着毛主席画像，激动地说：“我们老根据地人民最深刻地体会到，毛主席最亲，解放军最好。我们要用对毛主席的忠心，制作像章，迎接亲人解放军。”大家一致表示，要又快又好地做出一种“葵花永远朝着红太阳，忠心献给毛主席”的像章，送给解放军。
    做像章没有钢模，工人们就找来一根钢柱，把蓝图划在上面，用锉刀一刀一刀地雕刻。钢模做成后，又缺少冲床，工人们就用别的机器代替。大家连续奋战，第二天，金光闪闪的毛主席像章终于制出来了，大家满怀激情，把像章送到了亲人解放军手里。
    叶坪公社桔林大队贫农社员杨美英，最近在生产队的帮助下盖了一栋新房子。杨美英高兴得逢人就说：“有了毛主席，我们穷人家才能盖起这新房子啊！要感谢毛主席，祝毛主席万寿无疆！”有一天她听说离她家不远的老黄要修房子，住在老黄家的两个解放军同志没有地方住。她想解放军是毛主席派来的亲人，有了毛主席，有了解放军，贫下中农才有今天的幸福生活。她决定把自己的新房子让给解放军住。她跑去和老黄商量好，还怕解放军不去，就趁两位解放军同志不在家，把他们的东西搬到了新房子里。傍晚，外出的两位解放军战士回来了。杨美英把两位亲人引到了新房子里。房门口挂着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，两边贴着毛主席语录：“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？”杨美英热情地对两位解放军同志说：“同志啊！你们就住在这里吧，可不能走啊！”杨大嫂无限热爱解放军的心情，使两位战士非常感动。他们同杨大嫂一起在毛主席像前，共同敬祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
