Cadres Participating in Labor is Good

The Dongfeng Garment Cooperative in Zhangjiakou established a revolutionary committee at the end of last year. Since then, the members of the committee have followed Chairman Mao's great directive to "insist on the system of cadres participating in collective productive labor" and have consistently participated in production labor.

Through practice, the members of the revolutionary committee have summarized three benefits of cadres participating in labor: quickly gathering the opinions of the masses, quickly unifying the leadership's thoughts, and quickly solving practical problems. At the beginning of this year, several leaders of the revolutionary committee heard workers complain that the work of the accountants, warehouse keepers, and business staff was not coordinated; one would leave just as the other arrived. Workers had to spend a long time in the warehouse to get materials, affecting production. At a meeting, the comrades of the revolutionary committee discussed and decided to help the accountants, warehouse keepers, and business staff improve their ideological understanding and work methods. Except for one person who stayed to handle general affairs, the other two would work in the workshop for half a day and work for half a day. They would directly deliver the materials needed for the day to the workers. The workers were very satisfied with this arrangement.

In early May this year, the Dongfeng Garment Cooperative accepted a task to produce hats. Before delivery, the products were inspected and found to be completely qualified. However, when handed over to the ordering unit, they were deemed "unqualified" and had to be redone. After a second inspection by the leadership and the masses, the products were confirmed to be qualified. However, upon the second delivery, the other party still said they were "unqualified." At this point, the revolutionary committee member who was working with the workers felt something was amiss. He studied Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," and together with the workers, analyzed the situation from a class struggle perspective. They believed there must be something fishy. Later, through joint investigation and analysis with the revolutionary committee of the ordering unit, the truth was revealed: it turned out that a bad element in the ordering unit had sabotaged the production to disrupt the revolution and production and damage the reputation of the Dongfeng Garment Cooperative. These vivid class struggle facts deeply educated all the employees. They said, "The string of class struggle must never be relaxed, and the attack on class enemies must never stop." The workers also said, "With the cadres of the revolutionary committee working alongside us, any problem can be solved."

The members of the revolutionary committee, through labor, broke down the old frameworks of revisionism together with the revolutionary workers, and established a new spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people. In the past, making a piece of clothing took at least ten days to half a month, and sometimes even one or two months. Now, it generally does not exceed a week. One day, a few Mongolian customers came to the second service department where revolutionary committee member Wang Yanfen worked to have clothes made. As soon as they entered, they asked how long it would take to make a piece of clothing. The workers replied, "Seven days." The Mongolian customers said, "We can't wait," and started to leave. Wang Yanfen thought, "We should first meet the needs of customers who have traveled a long way." She looked at the workers in the same workshop and said to the customers, "The time can be shortened." After learning about the situation of these Mongolian customers, they decided to make the clothes that day. After measuring the sizes, everyone worked together, dividing the tasks, and by noon, the clothes were finished. When the Mongolian comrades came to pick up the clothes, they expressed their gratitude in Mongolian, singing "Long Live Chairman Mao" joyfully, dancing, and then singing "The East is Red" with the workers, expressing their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Because the members of the revolutionary committee worked alongside the workers in production labor, studied Chairman Mao's works together, and promoted revolution and production together, the revolutionary workers of the Dongfeng Garment Cooperative were full of spirit and enthusiasm. In the first half of this year, they completed their production plans ahead of schedule every month.

　　干部参加劳动就是好
    张家口市东风服装社，去年年底成立革委会以后，革委会成员就遵照毛主席“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度”的伟大教导，坚持参加生产劳动。
    革委会成员通过实践，总结出了干部参加劳动有三快：听取群众意见快，领导统一思想快，解决实际问题快。今年年初，革委会的几个领导成员听到工人反映，会计、保管员和业务员的工作不协调，这个前脚走，那个后脚到；工人到库房领一次东西花的时间很长，影响生产。在碰头会上，革委会的同志经过研究，决定帮助会计、保管员和业务员提高思想认识，改进工作方法。每天除留一个人值班，处理一般事务工作外，其他两个人都到车间半天劳动，半天工作。把车间一天要领用的各种用品直接送到工人手里。这样做，工人们很满意。
    今年五月初，东风服装社接受了一项制做帽子的任务。交货前经过检验，产品完全合格。可是，交给定货单位一检查，却说“不合格”，要返工重做。第二次经过领导和群众共同检验，肯定合格。可是再交货时，对方还说“不合格”。这时，和工人一起劳动的革委会委员感到有些不对头。他带着这个问题，学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，和工人一起用阶级斗争的观点进行了研究，大家认为这里面一定有“鬼”。后来，经过和定货单位革委会共同调查、分析，弄清了事实真象：原来是定货单位的一个坏分子为了破坏抓革命促生产和破坏东风服装社的声誉而捣的鬼。这些活生生的阶级斗争事实，深刻地教育了全体职工。他们说：“阶级斗争的弦一刻也松不得，向阶级敌人进攻一刻也停不得。”职工们还说：“有革委会的干部和我们一起劳动，什么难题也能解决。”
    革委会的成员在劳动中，和革命职工一起，大破修正主义的旧框框，大立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的新风尚。过去，做一件衣服少则十天半月，多则一两个月。现在，一般不超过一周。一天，有几位蒙族顾客到革委会委员王燕芬所在的第二服务处做衣服。一进门就问做件衣服用多长时间，工人回答说：“七天。”几位蒙族顾客说了声“等不及”，就往外走。王燕芬想：应该首先满足远道而来的顾客的需要。她看了看同车间的工人，就对顾客说：“时间可以提前。”他们问清这些蒙族顾客的情况后，决定当天就给做好。量好尺寸以后，大家一齐动手，分工协作，一上午就把衣服做成了。当几位蒙族同志来取衣服的时候，他们怀着感激的心情，用蒙语高兴地唱起《祝福毛主席万寿无疆》，边唱边跳，然后又和工人们一起高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情。
    由于革委会成员在生产劳动中和工人们打成一片，一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起抓革命促生产，东风服装社的革命职工精神焕发，干劲倍增。今年上半年，他们月月提前完成生产计划。
