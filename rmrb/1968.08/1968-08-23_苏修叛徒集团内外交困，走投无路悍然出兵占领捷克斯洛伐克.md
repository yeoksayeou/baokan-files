The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, facing both internal and external difficulties and with no way out, ruthlessly sent troops to occupy Czechoslovakia.

	BEIJING, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- According to reports from Prague, the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique adopted naked banditry, sending a large number of troops on August 20 to brutally invade the entire territory of Czechoslovakia, committing heinous crimes against the Czechoslovak people. This is the most blatant exposure of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's crazed pursuit of imperialist hegemony, the most shameless performance of the dogfight between the Soviet and Czechoslovak revisionist traitor cliques, the result of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's direct collusion with U.S. imperialism in an attempt to redivide the world, and the desperate struggle of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique to save the entire modern revisionist clique from disintegration and impending doom. It fully exposes the true nature of the Soviet paper tiger.

	According to various reports, on the night of August 20, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, together with the revisionist cliques of Poland, East Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria, simultaneously dispatched large numbers of ground and air forces from many places to invade Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique specifically instructed the Soviet ambassador to the United States, Dobrynin, to report this act of aggression directly to the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson. That evening, Johnson convened an emergency meeting of the U.S. National Security Council to discuss this issue and, after the meeting, instructed U.S. Secretary of State Rusk to summon Dobrynin to the White House for further secret talks.

	After the Soviet and its lackeys' troops invaded Czechoslovak territory, the Czechoslovak revisionist clique adopted a policy of "non-resistance," repeatedly calling on the nation's military and civilians to "remain calm." Thus, the invading troops quickly occupied Czechoslovakia's major cities and the entire territory, sealing off the country's borders. Soviet tanks, armored vehicles, and other military vehicles rampaged through the streets of Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, while Soviet jet fighters circled overhead day and night. Soviet troops controlled Prague's main thoroughfares, occupied the capital's airport, radio station, news agency, newspaper offices, and surrounded or occupied the Czechoslovak presidential palace, the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak revisionist clique, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and other key departments. According to Western news agencies, the Soviet troops detained and arrested the Czechoslovak revisionist clique's party and government leaders, including the First Secretary of the Central Committee, Dubček, President Svoboda, Prime Minister Černík, Chairman of the National Assembly Smrkovský, and Chairman of the Czech National Assembly Číšar.

	At the same time as sending troops into Czechoslovakia, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique authorized TASS to issue a highly hypocritical statement on August 21, shamelessly claiming that their armed invasion of Czechoslovakia was based on the principle of "unbreakable friendship and cooperation" and was to "defend the achievements of socialism" and so on, in an attempt to manufacture excuses and justify their naked aggression.

	The Czechoslovak working people are extremely indignant at the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's brutal invasion and the Czechoslovak revisionist clique's shameful betrayal. Despite the invading troops' suppression, they have taken to the streets in strikes and demonstrations, shouting, "Soviet invaders, get out!" According to reports, residents of Prague, Bratislava, and other cities have clashed and resisted the invading troops. Many people have used public buses and other means to build barricades, set ambushes, and throw burning objects from rooftops to stop the tanks. Many ammunition trucks and tanks have been set on fire. They have also repeatedly surrounded the invading troops for debates and distributed leaflets demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops. Over the past two days, the number of casualties on both sides has reached several hundred. Currently, gunfire can still be heard in these cities.

	The Soviet leadership's unprecedented brazen armed intervention and invasion of Czechoslovakia is the inevitable result of the Soviet leadership's long-term pursuit of the revisionist line. This incident reflects the deepening and unsolvable internal crises and serious contradictions within the modern revisionist clique centered on the Soviet Union, and the great bankruptcy of modern revisionism.

	For many years, the Soviet leaders, from Khrushchev to Brezhnev and Kosygin, have fully restored capitalism within the Soviet Union and have actively served as the chief henchman of U.S. imperialism in suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. In their relations with the Czechoslovak and other Eastern European revisionist states, the Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of great-power chauvinism and national egoism, turning Eastern European countries into their vassal states and colonies, and continuously tightening their control over these countries' ruling cliques while ruthlessly oppressing and exploiting the broad masses of the people. The Eastern European revisionist cliques, in turn, have tried to break free from the Soviet Union's strict control and directly deal with the imperialists led by the United States. Thus, the struggle between the Soviet Union and its lackeys in Eastern Europe has intensified, and the disintegration has accelerated. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique's invasion of Czechoslovakia this time is a desperate attempt to maintain its already bankrupt hegemony.

	As early as the end of last year, the struggle within the Czechoslovak revisionist clique and between the Soviet and Czechoslovak revisionist cliques had become public. The Soviet Union's favorite in Czechoslovakia, Novotný, due to his active pursuit of the Soviet Union's line of restoring capitalism, caused class divisions and class struggles in Czechoslovakia to become increasingly sharp, and the economy to fall into deep difficulties, arousing strong dissatisfaction and resistance from the broad masses of the people. In this situation, the struggle within the Czechoslovak revisionist clique intensified. The faction led by Dubček launched a fierce attack on the Novotný faction from the end of last year and, despite the personal intervention of the Soviet leaders Brezhnev and others, successively removed Novotný from his positions as First Secretary of the Central Committee and President, and systematically seized party, government, and military power. The Dubček faction, to consolidate its rule, on the one hand, rehabilitated the "ghosts and monsters" of the so-called "period of personality cult," and on the other hand, carried out a large-scale purge of the Novotný faction's officials in power.

	After the Dubček revisionist clique came to power, it more openly accelerated the full restoration of capitalism at home and, in foreign policy, under the banner of "independence and autonomy," tried to break free from Soviet control and actively "directly connect" with the West, developing relations. These developments in the Czechoslovak revisionist clique's centrifugal tendencies greatly shook the Soviet Union's position in Czechoslovakia and greatly intensified the contradictions between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia. To maintain its control over the Czechoslovak revisionist clique and, at the same time, to prevent the Czechoslovak revisionist clique's centrifugal tendencies from having a widespread chain reaction in the various revisionist vassal states, the Soviet leadership has, over the past few months, continuously exerted political, economic, and military pressure on the Czechoslovak revisionist clique in an attempt to force it to submit.

	Over the past few months, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's leaders, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others, have personally gone to Prague several times to directly intervene, and have also gathered the party and government leaders of Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, and Hungary to hold meetings in Dresden, Moscow, and Warsaw in late March, early May, and mid-July, respectively, to plot political and economic sanctions against the new Czechoslovak leadership in an attempt to force the Dubček clique to compromise. To increase this pressure, they signed a joint letter to the Czechoslovak revisionist clique at the Warsaw meeting in mid-July, which was in the nature of an ultimatum. In this letter, the traitors furiously denounced the Czechoslovak revisionist clique for "losing control of the situation," claiming that the situation was "serious" and that this situation threatened the "common vital interests" of the Soviet and other countries, i.e., the hegemony of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and therefore could not be "ignored," etc., in an attempt to manufacture excuses for military intervention. In addition to these secret meetings aimed at imposing a "high-pressure policy" on the Czechoslovak revisionist clique, the Soviet leadership has, over the past few months, launched a continuous and unprecedented large-scale attack on the Czechoslovak revisionist clique through the Soviet press.

	In addition to political pressure, after Dubček came to power, the Soviet Union also repeatedly attempted to use military force to force the Czechoslovak revisionist clique to submit. The Soviet Union, together with its lackeys from Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, and Hungary, frequently moved troops along the Czechoslovak border and, under the name of the Warsaw Pact Organization, forced the Czechoslovak revisionist clique to agree to a "joint military exercise" in late June within its territory. In addition, they held a series of other military exercises with various names near the Czechoslovak border.

	During this period, the Czechoslovak revisionist clique's leaders and press repeatedly launched fierce counterattacks against the Soviet Union. Regarding the joint letter from the Soviet, Polish, East German, Bulgarian, and Hungarian leaders, the Czechoslovak revisionist clique did not buy it at all. As soon as the joint letter was published, the Czechoslovak revisionist clique's leaders publicly stated that they "could not retreat even a step from the path they had taken since January" and demanded that the Warsaw Pact be amended to "guarantee the equal rights of the member states."

	In response to the Soviet Union's political and military pressures, the Czechoslovak revisionist clique made certain concessions on the surface but did not make any substantial concessions.

	In this stalemate, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, from July 29 to August 1, again went to Czechoslovakia to hold bilateral talks with the Czechoslovak revisionist clique's leaders in Čierna nad Tisou; then, on August 3, they held a meeting of the leaders of the Soviet, Polish, East German, Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Czechoslovak revisionist cliques in Bratislava. However, these talks also failed to ease the contradictions between the two sides. On August 20, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, despite everything, sent troops to occupy Czechoslovakia, which was the last desperate gamble of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, which was at a loss and had no way out.

	The great Lenin once pointed out with penetrating insight: "Now the bourgeoisie is like a wild beast, neither ashamed nor sane, committing one stupid act after another, sharpening the situation, and hastening its own doom." The Soviet revisionist traitor clique, these bourgeoisie dressed in the cloaks of Marxism-Leninism and socialism, are now committing such stupid acts.

	It is well known that the traitors in the Kremlin have long since completely betrayed Marxism-Leninism and socialism, fully restored capitalism in socialist countries, and have long since colluded with and conspired with U.S. imperialism, serving as the gendarmes to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. In these respects, they have committed crimes that are even more heinous than those of the Czechoslovak revisionist clique. However, they have the audacity to put on the banner of "friendship and cooperation" and stage a farce of going to Czechoslovakia to "defend" some "achievements of socialism." For several months, they have exerted various pressures on the Czechoslovak revisionist clique, to the point of taking desperate risks, originally intending to use these means to plug the "gap" in Czechoslovakia and strengthen their control over Eastern Europe and the entire revisionist clique. However, this has only further promoted the disintegration of the revisionist clique and put the Soviet Union in an unprecedentedly isolated position. After the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's armed occupation of Czechoslovakia on August 20, except for the four lackeys who joined them in sending troops, the other revisionist parties have either held emergency meetings or issued statements, expressing either "indignation" or "the most resolute condemnation" and "serious objections" to the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. Even the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's faithful lackey, the Indian Dange traitor clique, issued a statement criticizing the Soviet revisionist traitor clique.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: A revolutionary party and revolutionary people must repeatedly undergo education from both positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, to become mature and have the guarantee of victory. All true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people in the world, especially the Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people in Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, will receive another negative historical lesson from the new crimes of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The modern revisionists represented by the Soviet leadership are accustomed to using hypocritical revolutionary rhetoric to disguise themselves, but the roar of Soviet fighter jets in the skies over Prague and Bratislava and the rumble of tanks in the streets have completely torn apart the sentimental veil of "internationalism," "friendship," and "cooperation" of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others, exposing the true face of Soviet great-power chauvinism, national egoism, and imperialist law of the jungle. This incident will help the people of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and all countries under revisionist rule to see where the counter-revolutionary revisionist line is leading their countries, thereby promoting their new political awakening. All true communists and revolutionary people in these countries will rise up and thoroughly smash the reactionary rule of the revisionist clique in their own countries and settle accounts with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's heinous crimes. The great red flag of socialism and communism will once again fly high in the skies of these countries!

    苏修叛徒集团内外交困，走投无路
    悍然出兵占领捷克斯洛伐克
    新华社二十二日讯　布拉格消息：勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团采取赤裸裸的强盗手段，于二十日悍然出动大批军队，野蛮地侵占了整个捷克斯洛伐克，对捷克斯洛伐克人民犯下了滔天罪行。这是苏修叛徒集团疯狂推行帝国主义强权政治的狰狞面目的空前大暴露，是苏修叛徒集团和捷修叛徒集团狗咬狗斗争的最无耻的表演，是苏修叛徒集团为了直接勾结美帝国主义妄图重新瓜分世界引起的结果，是苏修叛徒集团为挽救整个现代修正主义集团分崩离析、面临灭亡的危机而进行的垂死挣扎，充分暴露了苏修纸老虎的本质。
    据各方面消息报道，二十日深夜，苏修叛徒集团纠集波兰、东德、匈牙利和保加利亚的修正主义集团，同时从许多地方出动大批地面和空军部队，侵入捷克斯洛伐克。在进行入侵时，苏修叛徒集团特别指示苏联驻美国大使多勃雷宁把这次侵略行动当面报告美帝国主义的头子约翰逊。当天晚上，约翰逊就召开美国国家安全委员会紧急会议讨论这个问题，并在会后指示美国国务卿腊斯克将多勃雷宁召进白宫，进一步密谈。
    在苏修及其娄罗的军队侵入捷克斯洛伐克领土以后，捷修集团采取“不抵抗”政策，一再叫嚷要全国军民“保持平静”。这样，入侵的军队很快就占领了捷克斯洛伐克的主要城市和全部领土，封锁了这个国家的全部边境。苏修的坦克、装甲车和其他军用车辆在捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格街道上横冲直闯，苏修的大批喷气式战斗机昼夜不停地在上空盘旋。苏修的军队控制了布拉格的交通要道，占领了首都飞机场、电台、通讯社、报馆，包围或占领了捷克斯洛伐克的总统府和捷修中央委员会大厦、国防部、外交部、内政部等要害部门。据西方通讯社报道，苏修军队拘留和逮捕了捷修的党政头目，其中包括党中央第一书记杜布切克、总统斯沃博达、总理切尔尼克、国民议会主席斯姆尔科夫斯基、捷克民族议会主席齐萨日等人。
    苏修叛徒集团在派兵侵入捷克斯洛伐克的同时，授权塔斯社二十一日发表一个极其虚伪的声明，无耻地说什么他们武装入侵捷克斯洛伐克是从“牢不可破的友谊和合作的原则出发”，是为了去那里“保卫社会主义成果”等等，妄图为他们赤裸裸的侵略行径制造借口，进行辩解。
    捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民对苏修叛徒集团的野蛮侵略和捷修叛徒集团的无耻叛卖表示极大的愤慨。他们不顾入侵军队的镇压，纷纷举行罢工和示威游行，高呼苏修侵略军滚出去！据报道，布拉格、布拉迪斯拉发等城市的居民同入侵军队发生了冲突和对抗，许多群众用公共汽车等筑路障、打埋伏、从屋顶扔燃烧物等一切办法来阻止坦克前进。多辆弹药车、坦克着火。他们还多次包围入侵军进行辩论，散发传单，要苏修军队撤走。两天来，双方伤亡已达数百人。目前，这些城市仍不断可以听到枪炮声。
    苏修领导集团这次对捷克斯洛伐克空前露骨的武装干涉和侵略，是苏修领导长期执行修正主义路线的必然结果。这个事件集中地反映了以苏修为中心的现代修正主义集团日益加深无法解决的内部危机和严重矛盾，反映了现代修正主义的大破产。
    多年来，苏修头目，从赫鲁晓夫到勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，在苏联国内全面复辟资本主义，在国际上积极充当美帝镇压世界人民革命斗争的头号帮凶。苏修在同捷克斯洛伐克等东欧修正主义国家的关系中，一贯奉行大国沙文主义和民族利己主义，把东欧国家变为他们的附庸国和殖民地，不断加紧对这些国家的统治集团的控制，对广大人民实行残酷的压迫和剥削。东欧的修正主义集团则极力想摆脱苏修的严密控制，直接同以美国为首的帝国主义作交易。这样，苏修同东欧娄罗之间的斗争就越演越烈，分崩离析日益加剧。苏修叛徒这次出兵捷克斯洛伐克，就是孤注一掷，妄图维持其已经破产的霸主地位。
    早在去年年底，捷修内部以及苏修和捷修之间的斗争即已公开化。苏修在捷克斯洛伐克的宠儿诺沃提尼由于积极追随苏修，在国内复辟资本主义，使捷克斯洛伐克的阶级分化和阶级斗争日益尖锐，经济陷入重重困难，引起广大人民的强烈不满和反抗。在这种情况下，捷修集团内部的斗争日益激化。以杜布切克为首的一派从去年年底开始向诺沃提尼派发动了猛烈的攻击，并不顾苏修头目勃列日涅夫等亲自出马一再干预，先后于今年一月到三月撤消了诺沃提尼所担任的党中央第一书记和总统职务，有计划有步骤地夺取了党政军大权。杜布切克派为了巩固自己的统治，一方面为所谓“个人迷信时期”的牛鬼蛇神普遍翻案，另一方面大规模清洗了诺沃提尼派的当权人物。
    杜布切克修正主义集团上台以后，在国内更加露骨地加速全面复辟资本主义，在对外政策方面则打着“独立自主”的旗号，加紧摆脱苏修的控制，力图积极同西方“直接挂钩”，发展关系。这些对苏修离心倾向的发展，大大动摇了苏修在捷克斯洛伐克的地位，大大加剧了苏修和捷修的矛盾。苏修集团为了保持自己对捷修的控制，同时防止捷修的离心倾向在各修正主义仆从国家发生广泛的连锁影响，几个月来，苏修领导集团不断对捷修施加政治、经济、军事压力，企图迫使捷修就范。
    几个月来，苏修叛徒集团的头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金等曾多次亲自跑到布拉格进行直接干预，并且还纠集波、德、保、匈的党政头目，先后于今年三月下旬、五月初和七月中旬在德累斯顿、莫斯科和华沙举行会议，策划对捷修新领导集团采取政治上和经济上的制裁，企图迫使杜布切克集团妥协。为了加大这种压力，他们在七月中旬举行的华沙会议上还共同签署了一封给捷修的最后通牒式的联名信。这伙叛徒在信中气势汹汹地大骂捷修“正在失掉对事件进程的控制”，局势“严重”，并露骨地叫嚷这种局势已威胁到苏修等国“共同的切身利益”即苏修叛徒集团的霸权，所以对此不能“漠然视之”等等，为进行军事干涉预先制造借口。在四出奔走，召开这些旨在对捷修实行“高压政策”的秘密会议外，这几个月中，苏修领导集团还通过苏修报刊对捷修发动了持续不断的、空前规模的攻势。
    与施加政治压力相配合，在杜布切克上台后，苏修还不断企图用军事力量压捷修屈服。苏修纠集波、德、保、匈的仆从，频频在捷边境调动军队，并用华沙条约组织的名义，迫使捷修同意于六月下旬在捷境内进行“联合军事演习”。此外，他们还多次在捷边境附近举行一系列其他各种名目的军事演习。
    这期间，捷修头目和报刊不断对苏修进行了猛烈的反击。对苏、波、德、保、匈的联名信，捷修集团也根本不买账。联名信刚一发表，捷修头目就公开表示他们“决不能从一月间所走上的道路上作丝毫的后退”，并要求修改华沙条约，以便“保障条约成员国的平等权利”。
    对于苏修以上这些政治上和军事上的压力，捷修表面上作过某些妥协，未作实质上的让步。
    在这种僵持的情况下，苏修叛徒集团于七月二十九日到八月一日又亲赴捷克斯洛伐克切尔纳同捷修头目举行双边会谈；随后八月三日又在布拉迪斯拉发举行了苏、波、德、保、匈、捷等六修头目会谈。但是这些会谈也都无法缓和双方的矛盾。八月二十日苏修不顾一切出兵侵占捷克斯洛伐克，就是苏修进退维谷走投无路而抛出的最后一笔赌注。
    伟大的列宁当年曾一针见血地指出：“现在资产阶级活象一只野兽，既不讲廉耻又丧失了理智，接连不断地干着蠢事，使情况尖锐化，加速着自己的灭亡。”苏修叛徒集团，这些披着马克思列宁主义和社会主义外衣的资产阶级，现在干的正是这样的蠢事。
    人所共知，克里姆林宫的叛徒们，早就彻底背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了社会主义，在社会主义国家全面复辟了资本主义，早就同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，互相勾结，充当镇压全世界革命人民斗争的宪兵，在这些方面犯下了比捷修集团有过之无不及的罪行。然而，他们却厚着脸皮打着“友谊和合作”的旗号，演出了去捷克斯洛伐克“保卫”什么“社会主义成果”的滑稽戏。几个月来，他们对捷修施加种种压力，以至最后铤而走险，原来本想是通过这些手段，堵住捷克斯洛伐克这个“缺口”，加强他们对东欧及整个修正主义集团的控制。但是，这一来却进一步促进了修正主义集团的分化瓦解，使苏修陷于空前未有的孤立境地。苏修集团二十日武装占领捷克斯洛伐克后，除了同他们一起出兵的四家娄罗以外，其他的修正主义党纷纷举行紧急会议或发表声明，对苏修或者表示“愤慨”，或者提出“最坚决的谴责”和“严重的异议”，就连苏修的忠实走卒印度丹吉叛徒集团也发表声明对苏修进行了指责。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。全世界真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，特别是捷克斯洛伐克和苏联的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，将从苏修叛徒新的罪恶活动中受到又一次反面的历史教育。以苏修领导集团为代表的现代修正主义者惯于用伪善的革命辞藻掩饰自己，然而布拉格和布拉迪斯拉发空中苏军战斗机的轰鸣和街头坦克的隆隆声，彻底撕破了勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流所谓“国际主义”、“友谊”和“合作”的温情脉脉的纱幕，把苏修大国沙文主义、民族利己主义、帝国主义弱肉强食的狰狞面目暴露无遗。这个事件将帮助苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和一切修正主义统治下的广大革命人民看清，反革命修正主义路线在把他们的国家引向什么样的地方，从而促进他们新的政治觉醒。这些国家一切真正的共产党人和广大革命人民必将奋起斗争，彻底粉碎本国修正主义集团的反动统治，清算苏修叛徒集团的滔天罪行。社会主义、共产主义的伟大红旗，必将在这些国家上空重新高高飘扬！
