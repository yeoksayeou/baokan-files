More than 40,000 urban youth who have settled down in rural areas in Jilin Province are firmly walking the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers as guided by Great Leader Chairman Mao. In the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, they are striving to achieve ideological revolutionization and are becoming an important force in the socialist revolution and socialist construction in rural areas.

These youth responded to Chairman Mao's great call, with the ardor and ambition to build socialist new villages. Starting from 1962, they successively came to the vast rural areas of the Changbai Mountains, Baicheng Grasslands, and Songliao Plains to settle down. After arriving in the countryside, they received warm care and enthusiastic help from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants educated these youth through telling family histories and village histories, strengthening their proletarian feelings. They decided to contribute all their efforts to the socialist revolution and socialist construction in rural areas together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. After settling down in the countryside, the youth who went up to the mountains and down to the villages took the poor and lower-middle peasants as their examples, diligently studying Chairman Mao's works, and continually arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Over the past few years, they have insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, taking Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles," "The Direction of the Youth Movement," and Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their guidelines for action. Many youth have become active elements in studying Chairman Mao's works and propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

These youth who have settled down in the countryside have been tempered in the sharp and fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads in the countryside. Together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, they have greatly enhanced their class consciousness and consciousness of line struggle. Many youth played an active role in the great criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev and his agents pushed in the countryside. When a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists incited the youth to leave the countryside, the vast majority of the youth who went down to the villages firmly stood on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resisted this reverse current, and carried out a struggle of opposing each other head-on. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "intellectuals must go among the workers and peasants, otherwise they will accomplish nothing" and unshakably walked the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers as guided by Chairman Mao. Together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, they smashed the sabotage activities of a handful of class enemies.

Under the warm care and enthusiastic help of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, the political and ideological consciousness of these youth has rapidly improved. At the same time, they have mastered a lot of agricultural production science knowledge from actual production struggles and have become a new generation on the agricultural production front. After a large number of youth went down to the villages, under the guidance of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they participated in the mass scientific experiment activities in the countryside. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants saw that a new generation was growing up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and were all very happy.

    坚定地走伟大领袖毛主席指引的同工农兵相结合的道路
    吉林四万下乡知识青年茁壮成长
    新华社长春二十一日电　吉林省四万多名到农村安家落户的城市知识青年，坚定地走伟大领袖毛主席指引的同工农兵相结合的道路，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，努力实现思想革命化，正在成为农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设的一支重要力量。
    这些知识青年是响应毛主席的伟大号召，怀着建设社会主义新农村的豪情壮志，自一九六二年起陆续来到长白山区、白城草原和松辽平原等地区的广大农村安家落户的。他们来到农村后，受到广大贫下中农的亲切关怀和热情帮助。广大贫下中农通过讲家史、村史等，对这些知识青年进行阶级教育，增强了知识青年的无产阶级感情。他们决心和广大贫下中农一起，为农村的社会主义革命和社会主义建设贡献出一切力量。上山下乡的知识青年在农村安家落户后，以贫下中农为榜样，勤奋地学习毛主席著作，不断用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。几年来，他们坚持活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的“老三篇”、《青年运动的方向》等光辉著作和毛主席的最新指示，作为自己的行动指南。许多知识青年成了学习毛主席著作的积极分子，成了毛泽东思想宣传员。
    这些在农村落户的知识青年，在农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐激烈的斗争中，同广大贫下中农战斗在一起，受到了很大锻炼，阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟大大提高。许多知识青年在向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在农村推行的反革命修正主义路线进行革命的大批判中，发挥了积极的作用。当党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子煽动知识青年离开农村时，绝大多数下乡青年都坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，顶住这股逆流，并且进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们牢记毛主席关于“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成”的教导，坚定不移地走毛主席指引的同工农兵相结合的道路。他们和贫下中农一起粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人的破坏活动。
    这批知识青年在广大贫下中农的亲切关怀和热情帮助下，政治思想觉悟迅速提高，同时从实际生产斗争中掌握了许多农业生产科学知识，成了农业生产战线上的一代新人。大批下乡青年到农村后，在贫下中农的指导下，参加了农村群众性的科学实验活动。广大贫下中农看到新的一代正在毛泽东思想的哺育下成长，都非常高兴。
