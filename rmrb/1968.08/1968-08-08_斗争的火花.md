The battlefield is at home.

The struggle of American blacks against police brutality has gained the support of black soldiers in the U.S. invasion forces, and more and more black veterans are joining the ranks of the anti-brutality struggle.

Recently, in a struggle against police brutality in Cleveland, blacks used some guns sent to them by black soldiers in South Vietnam. Moreover, according to black leaders in Cleveland, among those blacks fighting the police are veterans who were forced to participate in the Vietnam War. Western newspapers have also reported that some black veterans returning from South Vietnam have resumed living in black neighborhoods, and they are "determined to use violence to achieve social change."

The collapse of lies.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. In today's America, wherever there are concentrations of blacks, there are struggles against police brutality. Recently, a committee advising on the suppression of the black movement ("National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders") issued a report. The report had to admit that the black masses participating in the struggle against police brutality are widely representative, and that the participants are "not, as is commonly believed, black residents of areas supported and incited by outside professional agitators; they are in fact representatives of black society." The report claimed that there is little evidence of many outsiders participating in the struggle against police brutality, and in seven out of the nine cities investigated, 97% of those arrested were local residents. Black women make up a significant proportion of those participating in the struggle against police brutality, with over 40% of the participants in the Detroit struggle being women.

Drive out Humphrey!

On July 27, U.S. Vice President Hubert Humphrey went to the Watts area of Los Angeles for a campaign activity, attempting to deceive voters. The Watts area is a black residential area in Los Angeles, where 98% of the population is black, and the population density is three times that of the entire city. Humphrey arrived in the Watts area under heavy guard. The streets of the Watts area were filled with fully armed military police and spies, with a guard post every three steps and a sentry every five steps, as if facing a major enemy. Sentry posts were also set up on the roofs of some tall buildings.

As soon as Humphrey entered the Watts area, the black crowd roared at him: "Humphrey, go back!" "Humphrey, go to hell!" "We don't need you!" "Get out!" Humphrey, gritting his teeth, climbed onto the podium to deliver his campaign speech, but his voice was immediately drowned out by the boos and curses of the black crowd. In the end, he had to flee in a car, protected by military police and spies.

　　斗争的火花
    战场在国内
    美国黑人的抗暴斗争，得到了美国侵略军队中黑人士兵的支持，而且越来越多退伍的黑人士兵投入了抗暴斗争的行列。
    最近，克利夫兰的黑人在一次抗暴斗争中，就使用了一些在南越的黑人士兵寄给他们的枪支。不仅如此，据克利夫兰的黑人领袖们说，在同警察战斗的黑人当中有被迫参加过侵越战争的退伍军人。西方报刊还报道说，一些黑人退伍军人从南越回国，重新在黑人居住区生活，他们“决心使用暴力来实现社会变革”。
    谎言的破产
    有压迫，就有反抗。在今天的美国，哪里有黑人聚居的地方，哪里就爆发抗暴斗争。最近，一个为镇压黑人运动出谋划策的委员会（“国家关于破坏社会治安问题顾问委员会”），发表了一个调查报告。这个报告不得不承认参加抗暴斗争的黑人群众具有广泛的代表性，参加抗暴斗争的人，“不是象人们通常认为的那样是受到外界的职业煽动分子支持和鼓动的黑人聚居区的暴徒；他们事实上是黑人社会的代表”。报告供称，很少发现有什么证据表明有很多外界的人参加抗暴斗争，在已调查的九个城市中的七个城市里，被逮捕的人百分之九十七是当地居民。黑人妇女在参加抗暴斗争的人中占了很大的比例，底特律抗暴斗争的参加者有百分之四十以上是妇女。
    怒逐汉弗莱
    七月二十七日，美国副总统汉弗莱到洛杉矶的瓦茨区进行竞选活动，企图骗取选票。瓦茨区是洛杉矶的黑人居住区，在这个区内，黑人人口占百分之九十八，人口密度为洛杉矶全市人口密度的三倍。汉弗莱是在严密的戒备中到达瓦茨区的。瓦茨区的大街上布满了全副武装的军警、密探，三步一岗，五步一哨，如临大敌。一些高大建筑物的屋顶上也设了岗哨。
    汉弗莱一走进瓦茨区，黑人群众就向他发出了一阵怒吼：“汉弗莱滚回去！”“汉弗莱滚到地狱里去！”“我们不需要你！”“滚蛋！”汉弗莱硬着头皮登上讲台发表竞选演说，他的声音立即为黑人群众的嘘声和骂声所淹没，最后，他只得在军警、密探的保护下溜进小汽车，狼狈逃走。
