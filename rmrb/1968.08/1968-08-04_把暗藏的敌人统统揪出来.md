Title: Root Out All Hidden Enemies

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never resign themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last struggle." They "will inevitably come out to resist through their counter-revolutionary parties, groups, or individuals, while the people must unite and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely suppress these forces of resistance." Chairman Mao's great teachings are our guiding light for the proletariat to carry out the dictatorship of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, like the Chinese Khrushchev, stands on the reactionary bourgeois position, claiming that "classes have been eliminated" and that the struggle against class enemies should be "lenient rather than strict, and not afraid of the right." This is in direct opposition to Chairman Mao's great teachings.

Under socialist conditions, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes is a life-and-death class struggle. We must strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely suppress class enemies who resist and sabotage the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The idea of being "lenient rather than strict, and not afraid of the right" in the struggle against class enemies means not suppressing class enemies, recognizing enemies as friends, and encouraging class enemies to freely engage in sabotage and disruption. This is sheer right opportunism and a complete negation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The phrase "lenient rather than strict, and not afraid of the right" exposes the reactionary face of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party in shielding class enemies.

Taking our region where we support the left as an example, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the county committee, following the black directives of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and the old Beijing Municipal Committee, have shielded a class enemy who harbors deep hatred for the proletariat and persists in a reactionary stance during various political movements. They have even elevated him to be an "agricultural labor model" of Beijing City, brought him into the Party, and allowed him to control the political and administrative power of a production brigade. This class enemy, using the authority of others, has been carrying out class revenge in the village, brazenly promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. He has been shouting everywhere that landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have been transformed into "self-supporting" "laborers" and have "become honest, so we can be a bit more lenient with them." He has also, under the banner of "lenient rather than strict, and not afraid of the right," changed the class status of thirteen households of landlords and rich peasants to middle peasants and appointed some remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries and hidden landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed as small leaders to exercise bourgeois dictatorship over the masses. During the great "Four Clean-ups" movement, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants exposed the crimes of this counter-revolutionary element, but a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, disregarding the opposition of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, insisted that he has a "good root," "red thoughts," is a "good seedling," and a "good model," and plotted to change his household to poor peasant status, allowing him to continue serving as the Party branch secretary of the production brigade. The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Peng Zhen even personally intervened, intending to promote him to deputy secretary of the county committee, and threatened the masses, saying: "If you do not agree, I will arrange for him to become a deputy minister in the municipal committee." Look, how blatant are the counter-revolutionary acts of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and the Peng Zhen clique!

The fact that a thoroughly reactionary element was labeled as a "good seedling" and "good model" once again tells us: the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party advocates being "lenient rather than strict, and not afraid of the right" in the struggle against class enemies, entirely out of his and the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism nationwide.

"Whatever the enemy supports, we must oppose." We will not relax our dictatorship over class enemies. We will not be complacent about the resistance of class enemies. We must continue to deeply carry out the great criticism of the revolution, do a good job of cleaning up the class ranks, strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, and accurately and decisively strike the enemy. We must root out all traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionary elements hidden within the revolutionary ranks.

　　把暗藏的敌人统统揪出来
　　平谷县革命委员会委员、某部指导员 　张振录

    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”他们“无论如何是要经由它们的反革命政党、集团或某些个人出来反抗的，而人民大众则必须团结起来坚决、彻底、干尽、全部地将这些反抗势力镇压下去。”毛主席的伟大教导，是我们无产阶级向资产阶级和一切剥削阶级实行革命专政的指路明灯。
    党内另一个最大的走资派和中国赫鲁晓夫一样，站在资产阶级反动立场上，胡说什么：“阶级已经消灭了”，对阶级敌人的斗争，“宁可偏松，不要怕右”。同毛主席的伟大教导相对抗。
    在社会主义条件下，无产阶级同资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的斗争，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。我们必须加强无产阶级专政，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地将反抗和破坏社会主义革命和社会主义建设的阶级敌人镇压下去。所谓对阶级敌人的斗争“宁可偏松，不要怕右”，就是见阶级敌人不镇压，就是认敌为友，就是怂恿阶级敌人任意进行破坏和捣乱。这是十足的右倾投降主义，是彻头彻尾的取消无产阶级专政的谬论。“宁可偏松，不要怕右”，一句话就把党内另一个最大的走资派庇护阶级敌人的反动嘴脸暴露出来了。
    拿我们支左的地区来说，县委内一小撮走资派正是根据党内另一个最大的走资派和旧北京市委的黑指示，在历次政治运动中把一个同无产阶级有刻骨仇恨的、坚持反动立场的阶级异己分子，庇护下来，并且把他树为北京市的“农业劳动模范”，拉入党内，把持着一个大队的党政大权。这个阶级异己分子，狐假虎威，在村子里大肆进行阶级报复，猖狂地推行反革命修正主义路线。他到处叫嚷：地、富、反、坏、右分子，已经改造成“自食其力”的“劳动者”了，已经“老实了，可以对他们松一点”了。他还打着“宁可偏松，不要怕右”的旗号，把十三户地主、富农分子改为中农成分，并且叫一些国民党反动派的残渣余孽以及隐藏下来的没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子当小头头，对群众实行资产阶级专政。在伟大的“四清”运动中，广大贫下中农揭露了这个反革命分子的罪行，而党内一小撮走资派却不顾广大贫下中农的反对，硬说他“根子正”、“思想红”，是“好苗苗”、“好标兵”，阴谋把他家改为贫农成分，继续让他担任大队党支部书记。反革命修正主义分子彭真，还亲自出马，要把他提升为县委副书记，并且威胁群众说：“如果你们不同意，我就把他弄到市委当副部长。”看，党内另一个最大的走资派和彭真一伙的反革命行径多么露骨！
    把一个反动透顶的家伙封为“好苗苗”、“好标兵”这件事，再一次告诉我们：党内另一个最大的走资派所以鼓吹对阶级敌人的斗争“宁可偏松，不要怕右”，完全出于他和中国赫鲁晓夫妄图颠覆无产阶级专政、在全国复辟资本主义的反革命需要。
      “凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”对于阶级敌人的专政，我们决不放松。对于阶级敌人的反抗，我们决不麻痹。我们一定要继续深入开展革命大批判，搞好清理阶级队伍，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，稳、准、狠地打击敌人，把隐藏在革命队伍内的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和一切反革命分子统统揪出来。
