Two thousand young workers and students from the Kansai region of Japan held a rally in the afternoon and evening of the 17th in Fuchu City, Osaka Prefecture, strongly protesting against the U.S. imperialists using Osaka Airport for their war of aggression in Vietnam.

The rally also strongly protested against the U.S. military forcing the "Shinmeiwa Kogyo" factory to repair its aircraft and demanded an immediate halt to this repair work.

Osaka Airport is a civilian airport. However, within the past year, 943 U.S. military aircraft landed at this airport. At the same time, the U.S. military also airlifted military aircraft damaged by the heroic Vietnamese people to Osaka Airport to be repaired by the "Shinmeiwa Kogyo" factory. It is said that recently, the number of aircraft repaired each month has reached 70.

Young workers and students marched into the venue with banners and placards held high. In front of the 300 members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) from Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto, and Nara Prefectures, a red flag with the words "Long Live the Invincible Thought of Mao Zedong" fluttered in the wind.

Yamamiya Reizo, chairman of the Osaka Prefectural Committee of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), spoke at the meeting. He said, "The struggle against the U.S. military using Osaka Airport and demanding that 'Shinmeiwa Kogyo' immediately stop repairing U.S. military aircraft is an important part of the struggle to smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty.' We must resolutely unite with the broad masses of the fighting people and carry the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle through to the end."

Young workers and students who spoke at the meeting unanimously strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for waging the war of aggression in Vietnam. They said that the Japanese people will never allow the U.S. to turn Osaka Airport into a base for invading Vietnam and China.

After the meeting, workers and students held a massive demonstration. Despite the thousands of armed police sent by the reactionary Sato government to suppress them, the demonstrators bravely held demonstrations in front of Osaka Airport and the "Shinmeiwa Kogyo" factory. They waved red flags and shouted, "Smash the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'!" "Oppose the war of aggression in Vietnam!" "U.S. out of Japan and Asia!" They also sang the "Internationale."

Members of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) repeatedly shouted in the marching column, "Long Live the Fighting Unity of the Peoples of China and Japan!" "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long Live the Great Leader Chairman Mao!"

Another student contingent, after holding a meeting in the campus of Osaka University, also went to Osaka Airport to demonstrate. They broke through the police blockade, rushed into the "Shinmeiwa Kogyo" factory, and demanded an immediate halt to the repair of U.S. military aircraft. The fascist police brutally suppressed the students and illegally arrested 44 students. However, the students were fearless and persisted in their struggle.

    不许美帝把大阪机场变成侵略越南和中国的基地
    日本关西地区工人学生愤怒示威
    新华社十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本关西地区的青年工人和学生两千人，十七日下午和晚上在大阪县丰中市举行大会，强烈抗议美帝国主义使用大阪机场为它的侵越战争服务。
    大会还强烈抗议美军迫使“新明和工业”的工厂为它修理飞机，并要求立即停止这项修理工作。
    大阪机场是民用机场。但是去年一年内，就有九百四十三架美国军用飞机在这个机场降落。同时，美军还把那些被英雄的越南人民打坏的军用飞机空运到大阪机场，叫“新明和工业”的工厂修理。据说，最近修理的飞机每月达七十架。
    青年工人和学生高举着旗帜和标语牌斗志昂扬地走进会场。在大阪、兵库、京都和奈良县的日中友好协会（正统）的三百名会员的队伍前面，一面写着“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁”的红旗迎风飘扬。
    日中友好协会（正统）大阪县总部理事长雨宫礼三在会上讲话。他说：“反对美军使用大阪机场和要求‘新明和工业’立即停止修理美国军用飞机的斗争，是粉碎日美‘安全条约’斗争的一个重要组成部分。我们坚决要和战斗的广大人民群众团结起来，坚决把反美爱国斗争进行到底。”
    在会上讲话的青年工人和学生代表，一致强烈谴责美帝进行侵越战争。他们说，日本人民决不允许美帝把大阪机场变成侵略越南和中国的基地。
    会后，工人和学生举行了声势浩大的示威游行。示威群众不顾佐藤反动政府派出的几千名武装警察的镇压，勇敢地在大阪机场和“新明和工业”工厂前面，举行示威。他们挥舞着红旗，高呼“粉碎日美‘安全条约’！”“反对侵越战争！”“美帝从日本和亚洲滚出去！”他们还高唱《国际歌》。
    日中友好协会（正统）的会员在游行队伍中一再高呼：“日中两国人民的战斗团结万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
    另一支学生队伍，在大阪大学校园内举行集会后，也前往大阪机场示威。他们排除了武装警察的阻拦，冲进“新明和工业”的工厂内，要求立即停止修理美军飞机。法西斯警察对学生进行了残暴的镇压，无理逮捕了四十四名学生。但是学生毫不畏惧，坚持斗争。
