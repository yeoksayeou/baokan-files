Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, leadership by the working class is essential, and the participation of the working class is necessary. Together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary three-in-one combination must be implemented with the students, teachers, and workers in the schools who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time to participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to permanently lead the schools. In the countryside, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools."

Comprehensively Implement the Latest Instructions of the Great Leader Chairman Mao and Resolutely Execute the Battle Orders of the Proletarian Headquarters

Persist in the Leadership of the Working Class to Launch a Great Wave of Struggle, Criticism, and Transformation

The broad masses of workers across the country have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything." They have quickly selected outstanding worker representatives to form a vast workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, which has entered universities and colleges and units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not been well carried out. A great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation led by the working class and actively participated in by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country is surging forward with an irresistible momentum.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th, under the guidance of the extremely important latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, large numbers of workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have entered universities and colleges and units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not been well carried out. A great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation led by the working class and actively participated in by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country is surging forward with an irresistible momentum. Workers across the country have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything." They have proudly declared: With Chairman Mao's wave of the hand, we advance! We will definitely, under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, "raise our political consciousness in struggle," unite the revolutionary masses of all strata, advance along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, resolutely complete the great historical mission of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution!

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "To achieve the proletarian educational revolution, leadership by the working class is essential, and the participation of the working class is necessary. Together with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary three-in-one combination must be implemented with the students, teachers, and workers in the schools who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end. The workers' propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time to participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and to permanently lead the schools. In the countryside, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools." In recent days, the broad masses of workers in major cities and industrial areas across the country, with hearts filled with immense excitement and pride, have swiftly launched a wave of studying and implementing the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. Under the unified leadership of the revolutionary committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, they have quickly selected outstanding worker representatives to form a vast workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, which has entered universities and colleges and units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not been well carried out. They have been warmly welcomed and firmly supported by the broad revolutionary masses.

In the capital Beijing, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have entered 49 universities and colleges and will continue to enter other places where intellectuals are concentrated and units where the struggle, criticism, and transformation have not been well carried out. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams stationed in various schools have seriously propagated Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and have made significant achievements in promoting the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination in various schools. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in Shanghai, with their loyal hearts to the great leader Chairman Mao, have marched into 26 institutions of higher learning with high spirits. Yesterday, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team that entered Fudan University held a Mao Zedong Thought study class to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with revolutionary Red Guards, revolutionary teachers, and staff, and held a rally to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. By today, the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in Tianjin have entered 16 universities and colleges. The broad masses of workers, with deep proletarian feelings for Chairman Mao, said, "A thousand songs cannot express our boundless love for Chairman Mao, and a thousand red pens cannot express our boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao! Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we, the working class, must lead everything and definitely can lead everything well!"

In the industrial base of Northeast China, Shenyang, in the city of Wuhan with a glorious revolutionary tradition, in the city of Guangzhou, in the industrial cities of Xi'an and Chongqing in the northwest and southwest, and in other major cities, some have already had large numbers of workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams enter universities, while others are preparing to do so. The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in the Nanchang region, with fighting spirit, have successively entered 38 schools and cultural, scientific research, and other units. An old worker participating in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the Kaiping Coal Mine said, "In the past, bourgeois intellectuals and counter-revolutionary revisionists slandered us workers as being rough and uneducated, saying we can't do this and can't do that. They are simply too arrogant! Today, with Chairman Mao backing us up and asking us to lead everything, we must show them what we can do and let those bourgeois intellectuals see for themselves." The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team that entered Guangxi University, after arriving, immediately went to the classes and among the people, had heart-to-heart talks with the broad masses of teachers and students, and gave them vivid and profound class education through their own experiences in the old and new societies. The workers in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams that have entered universities and other units in Changsha have resolutely declared that they will definitely follow the series of battle orders of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, steadfastly unite and educate all forces that can be united, expose hidden traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!

The broad masses of workers in Nanjing, Jinan, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Hangzhou, Hefei, Harbin, Changchun, Fuzhou, Guiyang, Hohhot, Urumqi, Yinchuan, Xining, Lhasa, and other places have pointed out that the working class entering the educational front is a great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao, a monumental event in human history. We must bravely shoulder the heavy responsibility entrusted to us by Chairman Mao, constantly use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our subjective world while transforming the objective world, raise our political consciousness, be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and better shoulder the great historical mission of leading everything.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "Establish revolutionary committees with the three-in-one combination, carry out great criticism, clean up the class ranks, rectify the Party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations and systems, and transfer office staff. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories generally go through these stages." While organizing their outstanding representatives to form workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the broad masses of workers across the country have decided to immediately launch a new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories and enterprises, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings, and turn the factories into red Mao Zedong Thought schools. The more than 60 factories in the Sanjiaoshi area of Tianjin have opened various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes to study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Revolutionary workers have expressed their determination to use Mao Zedong Thought to struggle, to criticize, and to transform, and to create a new world of red proletarianism. The various workshops of the Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory have made arrangements to ensure that after sending people to participate in the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, they will better grasp revolution and promote production. The revolutionary workers of the Yunnan Coal Mine Machinery Repair Factory have submitted specific suggestions to the revolutionary committees for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units. The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Knitting Plant have decided to raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to continue the struggle of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The leadership organs of the People's Liberation Army at various levels and the troops executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks across the country have resolutely and swiftly implemented the latest instructions of the great commander Chairman Mao. They have immediately dispatched large numbers of officers and soldiers to cooperate with the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in entering universities and colleges across the country. The broad officers and soldiers have decided to closely unite with the working class, fight together, resolutely support the working class in leading everything, and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in all fields of the superstructure. They will thoroughly smash the conspiracies and tricks of a handful of class enemies to shake and sabotage the leadership of the working class, and create new achievements in the great struggle to seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution. The Air Force and Navy officers and soldiers participating in the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams of Beijing Institute of Machinery and Beijing Institute of Languages, after entering the schools, have actively cooperated with the workers to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the classes and dormitories, helped the broad revolutionary teachers and students to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, thoroughly criticized the reactionary theory of "multiple centers is no center," consolidated the revolutionary great alliance, and promoted the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who cooperated with the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams in entering Tsinghua University, Peking University, Renmin University of China, Fudan University in Shanghai, Tongji University, Tianjin Institute of Technology, Nankai University, and other universities and colleges have humbly learned from the working class, resolutely supported the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the working class, and carried the proletarian educational revolution to the end.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants across the country have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article and unanimously expressed their support for the working class leading everything and being reliable allies of the working class. Active learner and applier of Mao Zedong Thought, Gu Atao, said, "Under the command of the great leader Chairman Mao, the working class led us to overthrow the three great mountains; in the Cultural Revolution, the working class led us to smash the bourgeois headquarters headed by Liu Shaoqi. In the current great wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, only by persisting in the leadership of the working class can we seize the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution and ensure that our socialist mountains will never change color." National agricultural labor models Li Shunda and Wu Chun'an said, "The working class leading the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the superstructure is a serious class struggle and will definitely encounter various obstacles. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, are the most reliable allies of the working class and resolutely support the working class leading everything. Whoever opposes the leadership of the working class is our enemy, and we will overthrow them." The deputy political instructor of the militia in Kangfeng Brigade, Pingxiang City, Guangxi, Nong Qunying, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao asked us poor and lower-middle peasants to manage the schools in the countryside. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to manage the schools well and make the schools truly a battlefield for cultivating the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause."

The broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary intellectuals across the country have decided to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with practical actions. Many universities and colleges have held grand meetings to warmly welcome the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering the schools to directly lead the educational revolution and all work in the schools. They affectionately called the workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams "comrades sent by Chairman Mao" and firmly supported the workers' propaganda teams staying for a long time and permanently leading the schools. Many universities and colleges that have not yet had workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams entering have requested that the workers' propaganda teams enter the schools as soon as possible. They, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapons, resolutely criticized various fallacies that despise workers and peasants, decided to put down the airs of intellectuals, walk the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao, thoroughly transform the bourgeois worldview, and not become contemporary "Yegongs" who are afraid of workers and peasants. They must, under the leadership of the working class, launch a magnificent new wave of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end.
