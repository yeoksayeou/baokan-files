Black youths braved a torrential downpour to attack police, block patrol cars, and leave the ruling clique in disarray.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 (Xinhua) -- Black residents of St. Petersburg, Florida, continued their armed struggle against oppression for the third consecutive night on August 18, despite heavy rain, leaving the reactionary ruling clique in disarray.

After two nights of black resistance on August 16 and 17, about 70 to 80 brave black youths took to the streets on the night of August 18, despite the heavy rain, and launched attacks on reactionary police. Amidst the rain and gunfire, bricks and stones flew through the air. The police were caught off guard and, in a state of panic, deployed armored patrol cars and released large amounts of tear gas to suppress the brave black resistors. The blacks retaliated with bricks, stones, and shotguns aimed at the patrol cars.

Another group of more than 100 blacks bravely blocked a police patrol car head-on. They waited in front, and as soon as the police car approached, they rushed forward and launched a fierce attack with stones and bottles.

The reactionary municipal authorities, shaken by several nights of black resistance, ordered 400 police officers to be on alert and dispatched police forces to surround the central area where blacks reside. Police chief Smith, after "patrolling" the area, sighed upon seeing the high morale of the black masses: "It seems that similar situations may occur in the coming nights."

According to a report from Xinhua's Tirana on August 18, Albania's "Unity" newspaper today published an article enthusiastically hailing the vigorous development of the black resistance struggle in the United States.

The article pointed out that tens of thousands of oppressed blacks have stood up. They have not been intimidated by the Johnson administration's massacres, suppression, and arrests but have bravely engaged in face-to-face combat with imperialist violence. This is another heavy blow to imperialism.

The article pointed out that to achieve true liberation and forever rid themselves of the shackles of slavery, American blacks, like all oppressed peoples suffering under capitalist rule, have only one path: the revolutionary path. This means taking up arms and engaging in resolute and unyielding struggle against American imperialism and capitalism.

    美国圣彼得堡黑人坚持武力抗暴斗争
    黑人青年冒着倾盆大雨袭击警察，拦击巡逻车，打得统治集团狼狈不堪
    新华社十九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国佛罗里达州圣彼得堡的黑人群众，十八日在滂沱大雨中连续第三个晚上坚持武力抗暴斗争，打得反动统治集团狼狈不堪。
    这个墨西哥湾海滨城市经过十六日、十七日两个夜晚的黑人抗暴斗争之后，七、八十名勇敢的黑人青年在下着倾盆大雨的十八日夜晚，又向反动警察发动了袭击。一时，雨声中夹着枪声，雨点中穿飞着砖头石块。警察被打得落花流水，慌忙出动装甲巡逻车施放大量催泪瓦斯，对英勇抗暴的黑人进行镇压。黑人们用砖头、石块和鸟枪瞄准巡逻车还击。
    另外一群一百多名黑人英勇地迎面拦击一辆警察巡逻车。他们在前面等着，等到警车一开到近处，就冲上去用石块和瓶子进行猛烈袭击。
    反动的市政当局被一连几个晚上的黑人抗暴斗争吓破了胆，已命令四百名警察处于警戒状态，并且出动警察部队包围了黑人居住的中部地区。警察头目史密斯在这个地区“巡视”了一番，看到黑人群众高昂的斗志之后，哀声叹气地说：“看来，今后几个晚上还可能发生类似情况。”
    据新华社地拉那十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》今天发表文章，热烈欢呼美国黑人抗暴斗争的蓬勃发展。
    文章指出，成千上万被压迫的黑人已经站了起来。他们丝毫也没有被约翰逊政府的屠杀、镇压和逮捕所吓倒，而是同帝国主义的暴力展开了面对面的英勇搏斗，这是对帝国主义的又一个沉重的打击。
    文章指出，为了取得真正的解放，永远摆脱奴役的枷锁，对美国黑人来说，如同在资本主义统治下遭受苦难的一切被压迫人民一样，唯一的道路就是革命的道路，就是拿起枪杆子，就是同美帝国主义者和资本主义进行坚决的和不断的斗争。
