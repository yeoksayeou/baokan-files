The Ceylon Communist Party's Red Flag Youth Alliance recently held its first meeting. Over 1,200 representatives and observers attended the gathering. Leaders of the Ceylon Communist Party, including General Secretary Samarasinghe, were present. The meeting began with the reading of quotations from Chairman Mao.

In his speech, Ceylon Communist Party General Secretary Samarasinghe emphasized the struggles of Ceylon's plantation workers and youth. He said that for over twenty years, the plantation workers in the interior had been misled by reactionary caste leaders. It was only after the appearance and development of the Red Flag Trade Union (Ceylon Plantation Workers' Union) under the leadership of the Communist Party that the workers found a fighting leadership. Only now have the plantation workers begun to realize that they cannot be saved if they stand outside the revolutionary struggle.

Samarasinghe pointed out that foreign and domestic capitalists have been able to exploit plantation workers cruelly because they are protected by the imperialist bourgeoisie's state machinery, such as the police and armed forces. Once the guns are taken from the hands of the capitalists' watchdogs and placed in the hands of the workers and peasants, the masses will achieve true liberation. Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

Samarasinghe said that although the reactionary forces appear strong today, they are doomed to destruction. Although they seem formidable now, from a long-term perspective, they are merely paper tigers, and ultimately, the people will emerge victorious. He stressed that the revolutionary road is long and arduous. However, we must persevere, overcome all difficulties, and achieve victory.

He said, "The light of Mao Zedong Thought shines across the world today. This light also illuminates the path of the Ceylon revolution. Therefore, we must believe in Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought; believe in the Communist Party and the masses, and advance under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

    锡共红旗青年联盟举行首次会议
    会议在开始时朗读了毛主席语录
    锡共总书记桑穆加塔桑同志强调指出毛泽东思想光芒照亮锡兰革命道路
    新华社科伦坡二十一日电　据锡兰共产党《红旗》周刊报道，锡兰内地的红旗青年联盟最近召开了第一次会议。
    一千二百多位代表和观察员出席了会议。锡兰共产党领导人桑穆加塔桑等出席了会议。会议在开始时朗读了毛主席语录。
    锡兰共产党总书记桑穆加塔桑同志在会议上讲了话。他着重谈到了锡兰种植园工人和青年的斗争问题。他说，二十多年来，内地的种植园工人被反动的教族领导引入歧途。只是在共产党领导的红旗工会（锡兰种植园工人工会）出现和发展之后，工人才有一个战斗的领导。只是到现在，种植园工人才开始认识到，站在革命斗争之外，他们就得不到拯救。
    桑穆加塔桑同志指出，外国和本国资产阶级所以能够对种植园工人进行残酷的剥削，是因为他们得到警察和武装部队这些帝国主义资产阶级国家机器的保护。枪杆子一旦从资本家的看家狗手中转到工人农民手中，群众就会得到真正的解放。因此，毛泽东同志说：“枪杆子里面出政权”。
    桑穆加塔桑同志说，虽然反动势力今天看起来很强大，但是他们是注定要毁灭的。虽然他们今天看起来气势汹汹，但是从长远的观点来看，他们只是纸老虎，最后胜利的将是人民。他强调指出，革命的道路是漫长而困难的。但是，我们必须坚持到底，克服一切困难，直到赢得胜利。
    他说：“毛泽东思想的光芒今天照遍了全世界。这些光芒也照亮了锡兰革命的道路。因此，我们应当相信马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想；相信共产党和相信群众，在毛泽东思想的红旗下前进。”
