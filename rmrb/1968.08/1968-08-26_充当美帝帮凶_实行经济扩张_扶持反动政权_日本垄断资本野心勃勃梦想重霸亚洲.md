According to a Xinhua News Agency report, our correspondent reports: The Japanese reactionary government of Sato and the monopoly capitalists are actively providing support to the U.S. Empire's lackeys in Asia, bolstering their American masters' counterrevolutionary strategy of invading Asia, and taking the opportunity to intensify economic expansion in Southeast Asia, carrying out exploitation and plunder.

In this criminal activity, the Sato reactionary government, on the one hand, directly "assists" the puppet regime in South Vietnam, and on the other hand, provides various forms of "aid" to the U.S. Empire's lackeys in South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, who have sent troops to participate in the Vietnam War, actively serving as the U.S. Empire's henchmen.

The Sato government also attempts, through economic expansion and political infiltration, to implement the plan of "industrial Japan, agricultural Asia," realizing its ambition to dominate Asia again.

Not long after the end of World War II, Southeast Asia gradually became a market for Japanese monopoly capital to dump goods. In the past ten years alone, Japan has earned $5.6 billion in foreign exchange from trade with this region. At the same time, Japan's capital exports to Southeast Asia have been rapidly increasing. From the end of the war to 1966, Japan, through "war reparations," "economic cooperation," deferred credit, direct investment, and other means, has exported more than $4 billion in capital to this region. In the four years since Sato Eisaku came to power in 1964, Japan has exported $2.2 billion in capital to the Southeast Asia region.

Japanese monopoly capital has also taken control of part of the raw material market in Southeast Asia. According to statistics, 100% of Malaysia's iron sand exports, 80% of the Philippines' timber and copper ore exports, 70% of Thailand's corn exports, 30% of its rubber exports, and 30% of Indonesia's oil exports have all fallen into the hands of Japanese monopoly capital. To further plunder the industrial raw materials of the Southeast Asia region, the Japanese reactionaries are planning to control the agricultural lifeline of this region. The July 15 issue of the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* openly clamors for Japan to "lead" the agriculture of the Southeast Asia region.

It is precisely from the perspective of "industrial Japan, agricultural Asia" that the Sato government recently proposed a so-called "Asia-Pacific Circle" plan, scheming to seize more of the commodity market and raw material market in this region.

    充当美帝帮凶　实行经济扩张　扶持反动政权
    日本垄断资本野心勃勃梦想重霸亚洲
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：日本佐藤反动政府和垄断资本积极给美帝在亚洲的仆从“输血”打气，为其美国主子侵略亚洲的反革命战略效劳，并趁机加紧向东南亚实行经济扩张，进行剥削和掠夺。
    佐藤反动政府在这一罪恶活动中，一方面直接“援助”南越傀儡集团，同时还给派兵参加侵越战争的美帝仆从南朝鲜傀儡集团和泰国、菲律宾、澳大利亚、新西兰反动派以多方“援助”，积极充当美帝的帮凶。
    佐藤政府还妄图通过经济扩张和政治渗透，推行“工业日本、农业亚洲”的计划，实现其重霸亚洲的野心。
    二次世界大战结束后不久，东南亚地区就逐渐成为日本垄断资本倾销商品的市场。仅在过去十年里，日本在对这一地区的贸易中已捞到五十六亿美元的巨额外汇。与此同时，日本向东南亚的资本输出也在迅速增加。从战后到一九六六年底，日本以“战争赔偿”、“经济合作”、延期信贷、直接投资等等方式，向这一地区输出的资本已达四十多亿美元，而从一九六四年佐藤荣作上台以来的四年中，日本向东南亚地区的输出资本就达二十二亿美元之多。
    日本垄断资本还占领了东南亚地区的部分原料市场。据统计，马来亚出口铁砂的百分之百，菲律宾出口木材和铜矿的百分之八十，泰国出口玉米的百分之七十和橡胶的百分之三十，印尼出口石油的百分之三十，都已落在日本垄断资本的手中。为了进一步掠夺东南亚地区的工业原料，日本反动派正在计划控制这一地区的农业命脉。七月十五日出版的《日刊工业新闻》公开叫嚷要由日本“领导”东南亚地区的农业。
    正是从“工业日本、农业亚洲”这一目的出发，佐藤政府最近提出了一个所谓“亚洲太平洋圈”的计划，阴谋更多地占领这个地区的商品市场和原料市场。
