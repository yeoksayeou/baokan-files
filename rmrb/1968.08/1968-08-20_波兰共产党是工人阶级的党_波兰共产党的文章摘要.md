The Polish United Workers' Party is the Party of the Working Class
— Excerpts from an Article by the Polish United Workers' Party

New China News Agency, August 19th: On December 4, 1965, under the rule of the Gomulka revisionist clique, the Marxist-Leninist Party, the Polish United Workers' Party, was established in Poland.

Not long ago, the Polish United Workers' Party circulated a lengthy article titled "The Polish United Workers' Party is the Party of the Working Class." The article exposes the Gomulka clique's betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and the restoration of capitalism in Poland. The article points out that since the Polish United Workers' Party has become a social democratic party, the working class needs its own revolutionary party. The Polish United Workers' Party was born out of historical necessity. The article elucidates: The Polish United Workers' Party must build itself into a revolutionary and proletarian party, struggle to overthrow the revisionist rule, and rebuild the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The following is a summary of the article:

A workers' party that deviates from the principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat inevitably takes the road of capitalist restoration.

The eleven years of Gomulka's rule have been enough for the working class to personally experience what Gomulka's "new stage," "socialism," and "democracy" mean. Workers have also seen that the "Polish road to socialism" actually leads to capitalism. This is the old road of the exploiting class, the road to "heaven" that the church has been preaching for two thousand years. Therefore, in Gomulka's "new stage," it is not the laboring people but the bourgeoisie who increasingly become the masters of the state.

The Polish United Workers' Party has changed its nature, turned to its opposite, from a revolutionary party to a counter-revolutionary party. All of this did not happen suddenly in a day or two; the danger of betrayal gradually increased until, in 1956, it manifested in a violent shake-up and a retreat to capitalism.

During the entire transition period from capitalism to communism, the working class cannot do without its own revolutionary political organization. The party of the working class is not the "people's party" advocated by modern revisionists; it must exist until the final elimination of classes and the transition to complete communism in the world.

Since the Polish United Workers' Party has become a social democratic party, the working class cannot be without its own revolutionary party. Therefore, the Polish United Workers' Party was born out of historical necessity. The founding declaration of the Polish United Workers' Party on December 4, 1965, states: "Without the Communist Party, without this vanguard of the working class, it is impossible to build socialism."

The new Polish United Workers' Party must critically examine the past, primarily criticizing the path of betraying socialism within the country.

From the perspective of social composition, the Polish United Workers' Party has increasingly become a petty-bourgeois and bourgeois party.

The leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party has deviated from the principles and methods of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. The policy of extinguishing class struggle and class cooperation, the policy of compromising with the bourgeoisie and the peaceful transition to capitalism, has gradually replaced the existence of classes and class struggle. Revolutionary policy has been replaced by reformist policy. Within the party and government departments, representatives of the working class and true revolutionaries have been replaced by "experts," that is, those with diplomas, who are actually representatives of the bourgeoisie. The Polish United Workers' Party is no longer a revolutionary party; the policies it leads today do not serve the working class but serve the development of urban and rural capitalism, a policy against the workers.

In the early years after liberation, the reforms carried out in Poland were within the scope of the bourgeois democratic revolution, aimed at monopoly capital, the big bourgeoisie, and landlords, but did not touch the small commodity economy in cities and villages. Urban property (houses and vacant land) and a considerable number of private capitals with fewer than fifty employees were not touched. Although great historical reforms were carried out, such as the nationalization of large industry, transportation, and banking, and the confiscation of landlords' land, a huge and very active capitalist production base remained in cities and villages. The great reforms completed within the scope of the bourgeois democratic revolution created a strong foundation for the socialist revolution, constituting the conditions for further revolutionary reforms in the economic base. The problem is simply to continue the struggle to turn the bourgeois democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. Such a prospect exists because the people's democratic state plays the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the vanguard of the working class—the party—is the political leadership of the dictatorship of the proletariat. To prevent Poland from retreating to the road of capitalist restoration, it is necessary to advance, to further complete the revolution in the economic base and superstructure through class struggle, to continuously implement policies to further restrict and eliminate capitalist economic factors in cities and villages, and to firmly and continuously strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The biggest and most difficult problem is to transform the peasant economy into a large socialist economy. In 1948, the path of developing production cooperatives was taken, which was actually the beginning of the socialist revolution. Gomulka at that time openly opposed the revolutionary transformation of the countryside and left the party. However, in 1956, he returned to power, and the production cooperatives were dissolved. The "new leadership" consciously abandoned the revolutionary path of transforming agriculture, gave up continuing the socialist revolution, and took the "Polish road" to capitalism. The abolition of policies to restrict and eliminate urban and rural capitalist factors is nothing but support for the development of the capitalist economy, a step towards capitalist restoration.

In their speeches during the thousandth anniversary of the founding of Poland, members of the Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party openly declared that there is no longer an economic basis for the existence of the exploiting class in Poland, and there are no antagonistic contradictions, attempting to use this to justify their policy of extinguishing class struggle and class cooperation, which is actually the peaceful transition of socialism to capitalism. If there is no longer an economic basis for the existence of the exploiting class in Poland, then it should be understood that there is no longer an exploiting class. If there is no exploiting class, then the logic of not conducting class struggle against the non-existent exploiters is established. All of this is a political deception, used to cover up the actual support for the development of capitalism.

The nationalized industry, transportation, banking, and foreign trade monopolies in Poland, during the existence of the dictatorship of the proletariat, had a socialist character and served to strengthen the economic base of the people's power and improve the living standards of the broad masses within the framework of the planned economy. When the socialist traitors seized the leadership of the party and the state, the "new leadership"—the Political Bureau and the state apparatus attached to it (since the party does not rule, as Gomulka himself openly said)—actually played the role of the dictatorship of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. We know that the economic base strengthens the superstructure. Therefore, the question of whether the economic base strengthens the proletariat or the bourgeoisie depends on who holds the power. In our case, when modern revisionists are in power, our socialist industry, transportation, banking, foreign trade monopolies, and the entire socialized economy begin to lose their socialist character and increasingly serve the interests of the bourgeoisie, rather than the laboring masses, just as in capitalist countries.

The people's property is daily and hourly flowing from the workers' pockets into the pockets of the emerging bourgeoisie, either legally or criminally. Billions of capital are growing, some in the form of state savings bank "savings," some hidden domestically or stored abroad in foreign exchange, forming the property of the new bourgeoisie. Luxury, extravagance, and poverty are developing in a striking manner. The manifestations of capitalist economic development are: deviating from the socialist principles of the planned economy and taking the path of market-regulated prices, economic incentives, wide wage gaps, inflation, and unemployment. The rapidly developing capitalism monopolizes the surplus. Workers labor for the bourgeoisie.

Abandoning the class struggle against bourgeois ideological influences in the fields of ideology, politics, and culture, and abandoning the transformation of urban and rural capitalist economies, marks Poland's path to capitalist restoration.

Someone might ask, how can we ensure that the Polish United Workers' Party will not become like the Polish United Workers' Party in the future, and not turn into a social democratic party?

The key to loyalty to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism lies in the hands of the working class. To ensure that the Polish United Workers' Party remains a Leninist party and a loyal vanguard of the working class revolution, it all depends on the workers themselves. The working class must learn from the past and firmly rely on its own strength, rather than relying on the charity of the bourgeoisie. The historical responsibility of overthrowing the bourgeoisie and its lackeys in each country and around the world, and building a classless society, falls on the shoulders of the working class. The dictatorship of the proletariat does not fall from the sky; the responsibility of seizing power cannot be replaced by anyone other than the working class.

Workers must take their cause into their own hands! Then, the party will become a revolutionary organization and a loyal command center of the proletariat. Only workers and true revolutionaries can prevent the party from becoming detached from the masses, degenerating, and sliding towards social democracy and the bourgeoisie. Lenin said: "Without organization, the working class has nothing." It can be said that even if the vanguard of the working class is organized, if its leadership falls into the hands of socialist traitors, it will achieve nothing. Only when true revolutionaries and Marxists lead the organization, can organized workers become an invincible force.

A Leninist party and Lenin's meaning of Bolshevizing the party lies in the leadership and the entire party under Lenin's leadership, mastering the basic principles and methods of Marxist dialectics, closely connecting with the masses, and skillfully applying them in daily practice. The Leninist Bolshevik party is an unparalleled model of proletarian discipline, combativeness, and the flexibility of struggle strategies. Criticizing errors can illuminate the path of struggle for the party, quickly correct mistakes, and, together with the masses, lead the struggle and march ahead. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that if theory and practice are combined in a revolutionary manner, if constant contact is maintained with the broadest masses, and if a serious attitude is taken towards one's own errors, then the party is a revolutionary party. The vanguard of the Polish working class, the Polish communists, under the banner of the Polish United Workers' Party, are building such a revolutionary and proletarian party.

The Polish United Workers' Party is the vanguard of the heroic Polish working class, embodying the class interests, demands, and aspirations of the working class. The Polish United Workers' Party unites the most advanced and revolutionary sections of the urban and rural proletarian laboring masses within its ranks.

To avoid repeating the betrayal of socialism, the composition of the Polish United Workers' Party must be predominantly working class, class-conscious, and connected with the life and struggle of the working class. The composition of the leadership organs must be predominantly proletarian.

Within the Polish United Workers' Party, there must be the main and best activists of the working class, the most loyal and self-sacrificing activists from the laboring masses. Within the Polish United Workers' Party, there must be old communists who have been tested and tempered through struggle, but young activists must also be recruited into the party, who join the party with the same enthusiasm as joining the army, to fight for the power of the working class and the dictatorship of the proletariat within the ranks of the party.

The Polish United Workers' Party is a party of revolutionary action. Under current conditions, the Polish United Workers' Party cannot act legally because it will be destroyed by communist traitors, who are its mortal enemies. Under illegal conditions, the composition of the party naturally must meet higher requirements. As the party develops, it is precisely this development of the party's ideological line that determines the following conclusion: the party should have a cadre nature, composed of the best and most self-sacrificing revolutionaries, who harbor hatred towards socialist traitors, who are willing to contribute their strength and abilities to the struggle for the cause of the working class, and who are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices when needed.

Even the best working-class composition cannot guarantee that the party will automatically engage in revolutionary activities. Whether the party is revolutionary or opportunistic, counter-revolutionary, depends on the leadership structure and its policies. Whether the party is revolutionary or counter-revolutionary depends on whose interests the party's policies serve: the working class or its enemies. The British Labour Party and the French Socialist Party, although they bear the label of workers, actually pursue policies of compromising with the bourgeoisie. They are better at protecting the interests of big capital than the bourgeoisie themselves. The former communist parties currently led by modern revisionists have also deviated from Marxism, betrayed the interests of the working class, and taken the path of collaborating with the bourgeoisie. If the party builds its activities on the scientific theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism in a revolutionary manner, if it closely combines theory with practice, the party's policies will serve the working class. If the leadership organs guide their activities with socialist revolutionary theory, and creatively apply it based on the analysis of specific situations and the needs of proletarian internationalism and the world revolution, then such a party is not only working class in terms of class composition but is truly revolutionary and proletarian.

Lenin said: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary movement." The Polish United Workers' Party is the party of the Polish proletariat, building its activities on the scientific foundation of the theory of the socialist revolution, Marxism-Leninism. It is not about mechanically repeating the words of the Marxist classics but about actually applying Marxism in struggle. Marxism is a science that shows the way and methods of action, but the action itself is carried out in the concrete reality of history. The whole difficulty lies in whether the party leadership is able and willing to correctly apply the scientific guidelines to current activities, whether it is able and willing to give its current policies a clear class and revolutionary character, which can enable the party to overcome difficulties, lead the working class along a revolutionary path that not only maintains the occupied positions but also strengthens these positions and expands the scope of activities and influence, thereby laying a solid foundation for future victory. Combining theory and practice in a revolutionary manner enables the working class to continuously advance in the struggle to fulfill its historical mission.

Modern revisionists fiercely attack the teachings of Marxism-Leninism as "outdated," using the struggle against dogmatism and the slogan of "creatively" applying Marxism to abandon its revolutionary content. Modern revisionists believe that defending the scientific principles of the Marxist classics is dogmatism, even quoting the words of the Marxist classics is dogmatism. In their view, only the distortion of Marxism and its revolutionary content is "creative." However, the fact is: only by truly creatively and revolutionarily developing and applying the teachings of Marx and Engels can great achievements be made. Lenin, in his struggle against the social democrats of the Second International and opportunism, as well as against the Second International itself, developed Marx's theory of the socialist revolution and the possibility of establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat in the weakest link of imperialism within one country. Lenin's genius in revolutionarily developing Marx's theory has been proven by the seizure of power in Russia. What happened in China is also the case. The result of Mao Zedong's revolutionary development of Lenin's theory is the establishment of the People's Republic of China. These are historical facts of world significance. While the new and old revisionists, the forgers of so-called "creative" Marxism, can list what revolutionary facts? They have "revised" Marx for a hundred years, but there are no positive results. All facts condemn them as traitors to the interests of the working class, strengthening bourgeois dictatorship. Events of world significance such as the great October Socialist Revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia, the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, the defeat of Hitlerism, the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and the establishment of the socialist camp, as well as the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, show: Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong have made great revolutionary developments in the teachings of Marx and Engels, revolutionarily and brilliantly applied theory to practice, and combined theory with practice.

In their struggle against the revolutionary theory of socialism, modern revisionists divide the classic writers of Marxism-Leninism into two categories. They declare: Marx, Engels, and Lenin, although they are outstanding thinkers, their theories are about the situation of the last century and are now outdated, no longer suitable for actual conditions. The bourgeoisie and their lackeys, the traitors of communism, do not engage in serious debates with the theoretical works of Stalin and Mao Zedong, which are a true treasure trove of knowledge for every revolutionary. They prohibit the sale of these works, and recently even prohibit the reading of Mao Zedong's quotations. This shows that the working class's mastery of Marxism-Leninism knowledge is the greatest danger to modern revisionism. Polish communists are not intimidated; they do not believe the lies of the revisionists. Communists must resolutely fight to defend the classic writers of Marxism-Leninism: Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Their works are the sharpest weapons in the hands of the working class against imperialism and its agents. Mao Zedong is today not only the most outstanding theorist of socialist revolution theory and the successor of the classic writers of Marxism-Leninism but also the leader of the world revolutionary vanguard—the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people—who are currently fighting against American imperialism and modern revisionism. The facts are as follows: the task of true revolutionaries is to never yield to the shameful actions of the bourgeoisie's attack on the successors of the Marxism-Leninism cause. Facing the deception and rumors spread by the traitors of communism about the leaders of the world revolution, the Polish working class does not allow itself to remain silent; it is engaged in and will continue to engage in the struggle to expose political deception.

The party's strategy occupies the primary position and determines the main direction of the struggle, that is, the seizure of power, the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the construction of socialism and communism. To accomplish the strategic tasks, the tactics of the struggle must adapt to the needs and situations arising from the ongoing class struggle. The Polish United Workers' Party believes in the existence of classes and class struggle. Class struggle is the driving force of action and progress. As long as class society exists, there will be classes, because class society will exist throughout the transition period, and class struggle will continue until the establishment of a classless communist society worldwide. The working class is a historically formed class whose task is to eliminate all classes and build a classless communist society through revolutionary struggle and is the only class that can do so.

Only the enemies of the people would say: society is peaceful, there is no class struggle. In our current stage of development, the party of the working class guides the class struggle to carry out revolutionary social reforms in the economic base and superstructure, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Class struggle leads to changes in the forms and content of production and distribution, as well as the forms and content of economic management. Every historically formed economic base has a corresponding superstructure. When the dictatorship of the proletariat exercises power, the working class supervises various reforms based on the existing economic base, adopts more efficient production methods, eliminates losses and waste, and strives to expand and strengthen this economic base, aiming to continuously increase production and increasingly meet the needs of all aspects of society. Only after the working class seizes power can all these tasks be accomplished. Therefore, the most important issue in the entire revolutionary struggle is the seizure of power by the working class. The dictatorship of the proletariat. Every manifestation of class activity is political, and it should be unyieldingly thrown into the general tide of the struggle to seize power and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In the period of struggle for power, the dictatorship of the proletariat is the goal, and after seizing power, it immediately becomes a means and powerful tool for the struggle to eliminate class society and build socialism and communism. Because after seizing power, class struggle becomes sharper, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot stop for a moment in the struggle to fully develop and strengthen socialist construction. Socialist construction must continue uninterruptedly on all fronts, within the economic base and superstructure. The dictatorship of the proletariat must be continuously improved and consolidated, and must be able to turn and maneuver flexibly at every moment and in every situation, and give a decisive blow to the counter-revolutionary activities of the class enemy.

Only the revolutionary road can enable the working class to seize power. The forms of struggle can be various, but their revolutionary nature is undoubted. The party, with class struggle as its guiding action, must carry out revolutionary reforms, making the masses continuously aware of the necessity of seizing power through revolutionary action and armed uprising.

Class struggle is conducted on all fronts, but there is always a main link in the struggle. In the current struggle for power, this main link is political struggle, the struggle to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. Only by putting power in the hands of the workers themselves can the working class solve all its problems. Through the struggle focused on the economic sector, through the road of nationalization of means of production, banks, foreign trade monopolies, land reform, collectivization, etc., to consolidate the already seized power. But class struggle is also conducted on other fronts, including the fields of ideology, science, culture, and education. Therefore, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot limit its leadership of class struggle to the political and economic spheres, because class struggle is also conducted in the fields of ideology and culture. Without smashing and conquering the bourgeois positions in the fields of ideology and culture, it is impossible to build socialism and create the solid conditions for the transition to communism. Such a revolution is currently taking place in China. Due to the lack of resolute struggle and purification in the entire superstructure, this paved the way for the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, Poland, and other socialist countries. After losing power and property, the bourgeoisie remains very strong in the fields of ideology, culture, and administrative management; they still have money and maintain international connections with the reactionary forces worldwide. With the support of various reactionary forces at home and abroad, the domestic bourgeoisie can restore power through conspiracies and other cunning means and deception. Class struggle takes various forms and develops in a tortuous manner. The tide of struggle in class society permeates the party and is reflected within the party. The development of class struggle, the balance of revolutionary forces, changes in the domestic situation, and the reflection of these events within the party require the leadership and the entire party to constantly combine theory with practice and struggle on two fronts to defend the revolutionary line of the party's policy against various tendencies.

To overcome the difficulties in the struggle under various circumstances, the party must maintain constant contact with the masses, primarily the working masses. The basic task of the Polish United Workers' Party is to win the trust of the working class. A party that is detached from the working class is no longer a revolutionary party.

While struggling to win the sympathy of the entire working class, we must urgently organize urban and rural allies and unite them around the working class. Whether it is seizing power or consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is impossible without the worker-peasant alliance. In the individual peasantry, the pillar of the party remains the poor peasants and semi-proletarians in the countryside. This is the social and political foundation on which the working class can struggle for an alliance with the middle peasants, consolidate the already seized power, and transform agriculture. The working class cannot seize power without seizing the countryside.

The Polish United Workers' Party hopes and strives to make the intelligentsia stand on the side of the working class and join the struggle. Revolutionary intellectuals in Poland, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, should play a great creative, progressive, and revolutionary role.

Only by closely connecting with the masses, with the working class, laboring peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, can the working class seize power. First and foremost is the party's connection with the entire working class, followed by the connection with the urban and rural laboring masses. The most important task of the party is to awaken the masses in the struggle, expand the scope of the struggle, and merge these struggles into a revolutionary torrent.

The Polish United Workers' Party is a party that is centralized on the basis of democracy. The basic characteristic of the party in its daily activities is democratic centralism and the conscious iron discipline of all party members. Unity of action determines the strength and combat effectiveness of the party.

The main task of daily struggle is to make the working class and the broadest masses realize that there is no other way to seize power except through armed action. Therefore, all propaganda and agitation work must be clearly revolutionary. It is impossible to regain lost power through reformist activities. Only the revolutionary struggle of armed uprising can lead the working class to the dictatorship of the proletariat. Regaining lost power requires the same revolutionary struggle as seizing power.

Currently, a bureaucratic dictatorship of sellouts is being formed in our country, a bourgeois dictatorship. This dictatorship can only be overthrown through revolutionary struggle.

The path of the social democrats is the path of reformism, the path of betraying the interests of the working class and defending bourgeois dictatorship. This is also the path of the traitors of communism. The path of communism is the path of revolutionary struggle for the working class to gain power and build socialism, the Marxist-Leninist path of the working class defeating the bourgeoisie.

The revolutionary unity and solidarity of the international communist movement and the workers' movement create the most favorable conditions for the comprehensive liberation and development of the revolutionary forces of each country. We are part of the world proletarian forces. We subordinate our interests to the overall interests of the workers' movement.

The revolutionary unity and solidarity of the world communist movement, the Marxist-Leninist movement, and the national liberation movement on the basis of the revolutionary principles of socialism and proletarian internationalism are the highest principles in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. Workers must unite in the revolutionary struggle on a global scale to ultimately defeat imperialism.

The Polish working class has a glorious past and a great revolutionary tradition. Before the war, we took an internationalist stance, defending the first state of proletarian dictatorship, and were called "agents of Moscow." Today, we oppose American imperialism and fight against modern revisionism, and we are called "agents of Beijing and Tirana." Yesterday and today, nothing has changed; true revolutionaries stand on one side of the barricades with the laboring masses, while the bourgeoisie and their lackeys stand on the other side. Whether yesterday or today, Polish communists, past and present, are only the loyal agents of the Polish proletariat and the warriors of the world revolution. Accusing true revolutionaries of taking a "pro-China" and "pro-Albania" stance can only intimidate a part of the nationalistic, vacillating petty bourgeoisie, while for the workers, such accusations can only strengthen the conviction that we are their most loyal warriors, the irreconcilable enemies of the bourgeoisie and their lackeys. The Polish United Workers' Party, the vanguard of the heroic Polish working class, together with the revitalized entire Marxist-Leninist movement, is united in the struggle against American imperialism and modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU, around the Chinese Communist Party and the Albanian Party of Labor.

Long live the international unity of Marxist-Leninists in the struggle against the enemies of the international communist movement and the national liberation movement!

Join the battle!

Strive for victory!

Capitalism will not pass in Poland!

Long live the Polish United Workers' Party—the Party of the Working Class!

    波兰共产党是工人阶级的党
    ——波兰共产党的文章摘要
    新华社十九日讯　一九六五年十二月四日，在哥穆尔卡修正主义集团统治下的波兰，建立了马克思列宁主义政党——波兰共产党。
    不久以前，波兰共产党散发了题为《波兰共产党是工人阶级的党》的长篇文章。文章揭露哥穆尔卡集团背叛马克思列宁主义，在波兰实行资本主义复辟。文章指出，波兰统一工人党既然变成了社会民主党，工人阶级就不能没有自己的革命政党。波兰共产党是在历史的必然性中诞生的。文章阐明：波兰共产党要建设成为一个革命的和忠于无产阶级的党，为推翻修正主义统治，重建无产阶级专政而斗争。
    这篇文章的摘要如下：
    工人的政党离开无产阶级专政的原则，就意味着
　　它不可避免地要走上资本主义复辟的道路。
      哥穆尔卡集团统治的十一年，足以使工人阶级亲
  身体会到哥穆尔卡的“新阶段”、“社会主义”和“民主”意味着什么。工人也看到了“走向社会主义的波兰道路”，实际上正是引向资本主义。这是剥削阶级的老路，是两千年来教会叫嚷的通往“天堂”的道路。因此，在哥穆尔卡的“新阶段”中，不是劳动人民而是资产阶级愈来愈成为国家的主宰。
      波兰统一工人党改变了自己的性质，走向了自己的反面，由革命党变为反革命党，所有这些不是在一朝一夕突然发生的，叛变的危险是逐渐增长起来的，终于在一九五六年通过剧烈的震荡出现了倒退，向资本主义的倒退。
    在从资本主义到共产主义的整个过渡时期内，工人阶级没有自己的革命的政治组织是不行的。工人阶级的政党不是现代修正主义者所鼓吹的“全民”党，它必须一直存在到阶级最后消灭的时候和全世界范围内过渡到完全的共产主义的第二个阶段的时候。
    既然波兰统一工人党变成了社会民主党，工人阶级就不能没有自己的革命政党。因此，波兰共产党就在历史的必然性中诞生了。一九六五年十二月四日波兰共产党成立宣言中说：“没有共产党，没有这个工人阶级的战斗的先锋队，就不可能建成社会主义。”
    新的波兰共产党必须批判地对待过去，主要是批判地对待我们国内背叛社会主义的道路。
    从社会成份这一点来看，波兰统一工人党逐渐地在越来越大的程度上成为小资产阶级的党、资产阶级的党。
    波兰统一工人党领导背离了马克思列宁主义学说和无产阶级国际主义的原则和方法。用阶级斗争熄灭和阶级合作的政策，用同资产阶级妥协以及资本主义和平长入社会主义的政策，逐渐地代替了阶级存在和阶级斗争。革命的政策被改良主义政策所代替。在党内和政府部门，工人阶级的代表，真正的革命者被“专家”，即所谓的有毕业证书的人，实际上就是资产阶级的代表所代替。波兰统一工人党不再是革命的政党了，这个党领导奉行的政策，今天不是为工人阶级服务，而是为发展城乡资本主义服务，是反对工人的政策。
    解放后最初几年，在波兰进行的改革都包括在资产阶级民主革命的范畴之内，是针对垄断资本、大资产阶级和地主的，然而没有触动城市和农村的小商品经济。城市财产（房屋和空地）和相当数量的、雇工在五十人以下的私人资本没有被触动。虽然进行了伟大的历史性改革，大工业、运输和银行国有化了，地主土地没收了，但是在城市和农村还遗留下了巨大的、极为活跃的、资本主义生产的基础。在资产阶级民主革命范围内完成的伟大改革，为进行社会主义革命创造了强有力的基础，构成了经济方面进一步革命改革的条件。问题仅仅在于，要继续为把资产阶级民主革命变为社会主义革命而进行斗争。这样的远景是存在的。因为人民民主国家起着无产阶级专政的作用，工人阶级的先锋队——党是无产阶级专政的政治领导力量。为使波兰不倒退到资本主义复辟的道路上去，因此应该前进，应该在阶级斗争中进一步完成经济基础和上层建筑中的革命，应该不间断地执行进一步限制和排挤城市和农村资本主义经济因素的政策，应该坚决地和不断地加强无产阶级专政。最大和最困难的问题是把农民经济改造为社会主义的大经济。一九四八年走上发展生产合作化的道路，实际上是社会主义革命的开始。哥穆尔卡当时公开反对农村的革命改造，并离开了党。然而，一九五六年他又上台了，生产合作社被解散了。“新领导”自觉地离开了改造农业的革命道路，放弃了继续进行社会主义革命，走上通往资本主义的“波兰道路”。取消限制和排挤城乡资本主义因素的政策，不是什么别的，正是给发展资本主义经济以支持，正是走上资本主义复辟的道路。
    波兰统一工人党政治局委员们在波兰建国一千周年时的讲话中公开声称，在波兰已经没有剥削阶级存在的经济基础了，已经没有对抗性的矛盾了，企图以此为其所奉行的阶级斗争熄灭、阶级合作政策，实际上就是社会主义和平长入资本主义进行辩护。既然在波兰已经没有剥削阶级存在的经济基础了，那么就应该理解为也没有剥削阶级了。既然没有剥削阶级了，也就证明不同不存在的剥削者进行阶级斗争就有道理了。所有这一切，是政治上的大骗局，是用来掩饰实际上对发展资本主义的支持。
    国有化的工业、运输、银行和外贸垄断，在波兰存在无产阶级专政的时候，具有社会主义性质，并在计划经济范围内为加强人民政权的经济基础和提高广大群众的生活水平服务。在社会主义的叛徒集团窃夺了党和国家领导的时候，“新领导”——政治局和附属于它的国家机器（因为党不进行统治，就象哥穆尔卡自
  己公开所说的那样），实际上起着官僚资产阶级专政的作用。我们知道，经济基础强化上层建筑。因此，经济基础是加强无产阶级还是加强资产阶级，问题在于政权在谁的手里。在我们的情况下，当现代修正主义者当政的时候，我们的社会主义工业、运输、银行、外贸垄断，整个社会化的经济，开始失去自己的社会主义性质，并在愈来愈大的程度上，起着国家资本主义的作用，象在资本主义国家一样，开始为资产阶级利益服务，而不是为劳动群众服务。
    人民财产每日每时都在以合法或犯罪的形式，从工人的口袋流到正在形成的资产阶级的口袋里去。数十亿资本在增长着，有的以国家储蓄银行的“储蓄”形式出现，有的是藏在国内或保存在国外的外汇，这构成了新资产阶级的财产。豪华、挥霍和贫穷这一对立的两极正以显著方式发展着。资本主义经济发展的表现是：脱离计划经济的社会主义原则，并走上市场调节价格、经济刺激、工资差距悬殊、通货膨胀和失业的道路。正在急剧发展的资本主义把剩余独占了。工人为资产阶级劳动。
    放弃在思想、政治、文化方面与资产阶级思想影响进行阶级斗争，放弃对城市和农村资本主义经济的改造，标志着波兰走上了资本主义复辟的道路。
    有人问，怎样保证波兰共产党将来不会变得象波兰统一工人党一样，波兰共产党不变成社会民主党呢？
    忠于马克思列宁主义学说和无产阶级国际主义的钥匙，掌握在工人阶级手里。要使波兰共产党永远是一个列宁主义式的党和工人阶级革命的忠诚的先锋队，这全靠工人自己。工人阶级必须从过去吸取教训，并坚决地依靠自己的力量，而不是指望资产阶级慈善家方面的资助。推翻资产阶级及其在各国和全世界的走狗并建成没有阶级的社会的历史责任，落在工人阶级身上。无产阶级专政不是从天上掉下来的，夺取政权的责任，任何人也代替不了工人阶级。
    工人必须把自己的事业掌握在自己手里！那时，党将成为一个革命的组织和无产阶级的忠诚的司令部。只有工人、真正的革命者，才能够防止党脱离群众、蜕化和滑到社会民主主义和资产阶级方面去。列宁说：“工人阶级没有组织，便没有一切。”可以说，工人阶级的先锋队即使是有组织的，但其领导掌握在社会主义的叛徒手里，也将一事无成。只有工人自己的真正革命者、马克思主义者来领导组织的时候，有组织的工人才能成为不可战胜的力量。
    列宁主义式的党和列宁关于党布尔什维克化的含义在于党的领导和全党在列宁领导下，掌握马克思主义辩证法的基本原则和方法，紧密联系群众，熟练地把它运用于日常实践。列宁主义的布尔什维克党是无产阶级纪律、战斗性和斗争策略的灵活性的无可伦比的典范。对错误持批评态度，可以使党正确地照亮斗争的道路，迅速改正错误，并在斗争中同群众一起，走在群众前头。毛泽东同志指出，如果以革命方式把理论和实践结合起来，如果与最广大的群众保持经常的联系，并对自己的错误抱有严肃的态度，那么，党就是革命的党。波兰工人阶级的先锋队，波兰共产党人，在波兰共产党的旗帜下，就是要建设这样的革命的和忠于无产阶级的党。
    波兰共产党是英雄的波兰工人阶级的先锋队，它体现工人阶级的阶级利益、要求和愿望。波兰共产党把城乡无产阶级劳动群众中最先进和最革命的部分，团结在自己的队伍里。
    为了不重蹈背叛社会主义的覆辙，波兰共产党的成份结构，绝大多数必须是工人的，阶级的，与工人阶级及其生活和斗争有联系的。而领导机关的成份必须在决定性的程度上是无产阶级的。
    在波兰共产党内，应该有工人阶级主要的和最优秀的积极分子、劳动群众中最忠实的和最有自我牺牲精神的活动家。在波兰共产党内，应该有经过斗争考验和锻炼的老共产党人，但是也应该吸收青年活动家入党，他们希望入党就象希望参军一样，以便在党的队伍中为工人阶级的政权进行斗争，为无产阶级专政进行斗争。
    波兰共产党是进行革命活动的党。在现在的条件下，波兰共产党不能合法地活动，因为它会被共产主义的叛徒所破坏，它是他们的致命敌人。在非法的条件下，党的组成自然必须要适应更高的要求。在党的发展的同时，正是这种发展党的思想方针，确定了这样一个论断：党应该具有干部性质，由最优秀的和最
  富有自我牺牲精神的革命者组成，他们对社会主义的叛徒抱仇恨态度，他们自觉地愿意把自己的力量和能
  力贡献给为工人阶级的事业而进行的斗争，他们准备在需要的时候作出最大的牺牲。
      甚至最好的工人成份结构，也不能保证党会自动地进行革命活动。党是革命的还是机会主义的、反革命的，取决于领导结构及其政策。党是革命的还是反革命的，取决于党的政策是为谁服务：是为工人阶级服务还是为它的敌人服务。英国工党和法国社会党虽然挂着工人的招牌，但却执行着同资产阶级妥协的政策，它们是比资产阶级分子本身能更好地保护大资本利益的资产阶级的党。目前处于现代修正主义者领导下的以前的共产党，同样也离开了马克思主义，背叛了工人阶级利益，走上了同资产阶级合作的道路。如果党以革命的方法把自己的活动建立在马克思列宁主义的科学理论基础上，如果它把理论同实践紧密结合起来，党的政策就是服务于工人阶级的。如果领导机构用社会主义的革命理论指导自己的活动，并根据对具体情况的分析，以及根据无产阶级国际主义和世界革命的需要，创造性地加以运用，那么，这样的党就不仅从阶级成份结构方面来看是工人的，而且是真正革命的，无产阶级的。
    列宁说：“没有革命的理论，就不会有革命的运动。”波兰共产党是波兰无产阶级的党，它把自己的活动建立在社会主义革命的理论、马克思列宁主义的科学基础上。不是教条主义地重复马克思主义经典作家的词句，而是在斗争中实际运用。马克思主义是指明道路、活动方法的科学，但是活动本身是在历史的具体现实中进行的，整个困难在于，党的领导是否善于和愿意正确地把科学指针运用于当前的活动，是否善于和愿意赋予自己的当前政策以鲜明的阶级的和革命的特点，这种特点能够使党克服困难，领导工人阶级沿着不仅能保持已占领的阵地，而且能巩固这些阵地和扩大活动和影响的范围，以至创立将来胜利的稳固基础的革命道路前进。把理论同实践革命地结合起来，就能使工人阶级在争取实现本阶级的历史使命的斗争中，不断地前进。
    现代修正主义者激烈地攻击马克思列宁主义学说
  “过时了”，在同教条主义斗争和“创造性地”运用马克思主义的口号下，抛弃了它的革命内容。现代修正主义者认为，捍卫马克思主义经典作家的科学原理是教条主义，甚至引证马克思主义经典作家的话也是教条主义，在他们看来，只有篡改马克思主义及其革命内容，才是“创造性的”。然而事实是：只有真正地创造性地和革命地发展和运用马克思和恩格斯的学说，才能取得巨大的成绩。列宁在同参加第二国际的各党的社会民主党人和机会主义以及第二国际本身的斗争中，发展了马克思关于社会主义革命和可能在帝国主义最薄弱的环节的一国之内建立无产阶级专政的理论。列宁革命地发展马克思学说的天才，已经被在俄国取得政权所证实。在中国所发生的事情也是这样。毛泽东革命地发展列宁的理论的结果，是中华人民共和国的成立。这些都是具有世界意义的历史事实。而新老修正主义者，所谓“创造性的”马克思主义的伪造者，能列举的革命的事实是什么呢？他们“修正”马克思已经一百年了，但是没有任何积极的成果。所有事实都谴责他们是工人阶级利益的叛徒，他们加强资产阶级专政。象伟大的十月社会主义革命和俄国无产阶级专政的建立、苏联的社会主义建设、希特勒主义的失败、中华人民共和国的成立以及社会主义国家体系的建立和目前中国的无产阶级文化大革命这些世界范围内的事件表明：列宁、斯大林和毛泽东，对马克思和恩格斯学说作了巨大的革命的发展，革命地和天才地把理论运用于实践，使理论同实践相结合。
    现代修正主义者在同社会主义的革命理论进行斗争时，把马克思列宁主义的经典作家分为两大类。他们宣称：马克思、恩格斯和列宁虽然是杰出的思想家，但是他们的理论是关于上一世纪的情况的，今天已经过时了，不适合实际情况了。资产阶级及其走狗、共产主义的叛徒，对于对每个革命者都是知识的真正宝库的斯大林和毛泽东的理论著作，不进行严肃的论战。他们规定不准出售这些著作，而最近甚至禁止读毛泽东的语录。这表明，工人们掌握马克思列宁主义的知识对于现代修正主义是最大的危险。波兰共产党人是吓不倒的，他们不相信修正主义者的谎言。共产党人必须为保卫马克思列宁主义的经典作家：马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东进行坚决的斗争。他们的著作是工人阶级手中反对帝国主义及其代理人的最锐利的武器。毛泽东今天不仅是社会主义革命理论最杰出的理论家和马克思列宁主义经典作家的继承人，而且是站在世界革命前列、当前同美帝国主义和现代修正主义进行斗争的世界革命先锋队——中国共产党和中国人民的领袖。事实就是如此，真正革命者的任务，是决不屈服于资产阶级攻击马克思列宁主义事业的继承者的可耻行径的压力。面对共产主义的叛徒关于世界革命的领袖所进行的欺骗和散布的流言蜚语，波兰工人阶级不允许自己保持沉默，它正在进行着并将继续进行揭露政治欺骗的斗争。
    党的战略属于首要的地位，并且由它来确定斗争
  的主要方向，即夺取政权，巩固无产阶级专政以及建成社会主义和共产主义。要完成战略任务，斗争的策略必须适应由正在开展着的阶级斗争而产生的需要和形势。波兰共产党认为存在着阶级和阶级斗争。阶级斗争是行动和进步的动力。只要阶级社会存在，就有阶级，因为阶级社会将存在于整个过渡时期，阶级斗争也将一直持续到在世界范围内建成共产主义社会。工人阶级是历史形成的，其任务是在革命斗争中消灭一切阶级和建成没有阶级的共产主义社会的唯一的一个
  阶级。
    只有人民的敌人才会说：社会上是平静的，没有阶级斗争。在我们发展的现阶段，工人阶级的党指导着阶级斗争，以便在经济基础和上层建筑方面进行革命的社会改革、巩固无产阶级专政。阶级斗争导致生产和分配的形式和内容以及经济管理的形式和内容的变化。历史形成的每一个经济基础都有与它相适应的上层建筑。当无产阶级专政在行使权力的时候，工人阶级对各种改革实行监督，立足于现有的经济基础之上，通过采用更高效率的生产方法，消除损失和浪费，力求扩大和加强这一经济基础，目的是不断增加生产和越来越大地满足社会各方面需要。只有在工人阶级取得政权之后，所有这些任务才能够完成。因此，整个革命斗争最重要的问题，是工人阶级取得无产阶级专政。阶级活动的每一个表现都带有政治性，应该不退让地投入到夺取政权、建立无产阶级专政的斗争的总潮流中去。
    在为政权而斗争的时期，无产阶级专政是目的，而在取得政权之后，则立即成为为消灭阶级社会和建成社会主义和共产主义而斗争的手段和强大工具。因为取得政权之后，阶级斗争尖锐了，无产阶级专政一刻也不能停止进行旨在全面发展和加强社会主义建设的阶级斗争。社会主义建设必须不间断地在各条战线上，在经济基础和上层建筑内继续进行下去。无产阶级专政必须不断地完善和巩固，必须在每一个时刻和在每一种情况下，都能完成转折和灵活机动并给阶级敌人的反革命活动以迎头痛击。
    只有革命的道路才能使工人阶级取得政权。斗争的形式可以是各种各样的，但是它们的革命性是不容怀疑的。党以阶级斗争为行动的指南，必须进行革命的改革，使群众在斗争中不断地觉悟到通过革命活动和武装起义的道路夺取政权的必要性。
    阶级斗争同时在各个方面进行着，但是始终有一个主要的斗争环节。在目前争取政权的斗争中，这个主要环节是政治斗争，是为取得无产阶级专政而斗争。只有把政权掌握在工人自己手中，工人阶级才能够解决自己的所有问题。经过把重点放在经济部门的斗争，通过生产资料、银行国有化的道路，实行对外贸易垄断、土地改革、集体化等等，来巩固已经取得的政权。但是阶级斗争也在其他战线上开展着，包括意识形态、科学、文化和教育各部门。因此，无产阶级专政也不能够把自己对阶级斗争的领导，只是局限在政治和经济范围内，因为在意识形态和文化领域里也进行着阶级斗争。不打碎和不征服意识形态和文化领域内的资产阶级阵地，要建成社会主义和创造过渡到共产主义的稳固条件是不可能的。这样的革命目前正在中国进行着。由于在整个上层建筑里没有进行坚决的斗争和清洗，这就为苏联、波兰和其他社会主义国家复辟资本主义开辟了道路。资产阶级失去政权和财产以后，在意识形态、文化和行政管理领域中仍是十分强大的，他们还握有金钱并与世界反动派保持国际联系。本国资产阶级在国内外反动派各种力量的支持下，能够通过阴谋和其它狡猾的手段与欺骗进行恢复政权的斗争。阶级斗争采取各种各样的形式，曲折地发展着。在阶级社会中进行的斗争潮流渗入到党内，并在党内得到反映。阶级斗争的发展、革命力量对比和国内形势的变化以及这些事件在党内的反映，要求领导和全党经常把理论和实践结合起来，在两条战线上为维护党的政策的革命方针同各种倾向进行斗争。
    党要在各种形势下都能克服斗争中的困难，它就必须保持同群众，首先是工人群众的经常联系。波兰共产党的基本任务是博得工人阶级的信任。脱离了工人阶级的政党，就不再是革命的政党。
    在为争取整个工人阶级的同情而斗争的同时，我们应刻不容缓地组织城乡同盟军，并使之团结在工人阶级周围。不论是夺取政权还是巩固无产阶级专政，没有工农联盟都是不可能的。在个体农民中间，党的支柱仍然是农村的贫苦农民和农村的半无产者。这就是工人阶级可以为争取同中农的联盟、为巩固已经夺得的政权和改造农业而进行斗争的社会政治基础。工人阶级不夺取农村就得不到政权。
    波兰共产党期望并且努力使知识分子站在工人阶级一边投入斗争。波兰革命的知识分子，在波兰共产党的领导下，应该起到巨大的创造性的、进步的和革命的作用。
    只有同群众紧密联系，同工人阶级、劳动农民和革命知识分子紧密联系在一起，工人阶级夺取政权才有可能。首先是党同整个工人阶级的联系，其次是同城乡劳动群众的联系。党的最重要的任务，是在斗争中使群众觉悟起来，扩大斗争范围，并且把这些斗争汇合成为一个革命的洪流。
    波兰共产党是在民主原则上集中的党。党在日常活动中的基本特征，是民主集中制和所有党员的自觉的铁的纪律。行动的一致决定党的力量和党的战斗力。
    日常斗争的主要任务是，使工人阶级和最广大的群众意识到，除了武装行动夺取政权以外，别的道路是没有的。因此，整个宣传鼓动工作必须明显地具有革命性。用改良主义的活动不可能夺回失去了的政权。只有最终实行武装起义的革命斗争，才能够引导工人阶级达到无产阶级专政。夺回失去了的政权，要进行同夺取政权一样的革命斗争。
    目前在我国正在形成卖身投靠的官僚专政，资产阶级专政。这个专政只有通过革命斗争的途径才能够推翻。
    社会民主党人的道路，是改良主义的道路，是背叛工人阶级利益和保卫资产阶级专政的道路。这也是共产主义的叛徒的道路。共产主义道路，是为工人阶级获得政权和社会主义建设而进行革命斗争的道路，是工人阶级战胜资产阶级的马克思列宁主义的道路。
    国际共产主义运动和工人运动的革命统一与团结，为每一个国家的革命斗争力量的全面解放和发展，创造最有利的条件。我们是世界无产阶级力量的一部分。我们把自己的利益从属于工人运动整体的总利益。
    世界共产主义运动，马克思列宁主义运动与民族解放运动，在社会主义和无产阶级国际主义革命理论原则基础上的革命团结，是反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的最高原则。工人为了能够最终地战胜帝国主义，必须在革命斗争中，在世界范围内团结起来。
    波兰工人阶级有着光辉的过去和伟大的革命传统。战前，我们采取国际主义态度，保卫第一个无产阶级专政的国家，我们被称为莫斯科的“代理人”。今天，我们敌视美帝国主义和同现代修正主义作斗争，我们被称作北京与地拉那的“代理人”。昨天与今天，什么也没有变化，真正的革命者与劳动群众一起站在战垒的一边，而资产阶级及其走狗站在另一边。不论昨天与今天，波兰共产党人过去和现在都只是波兰无产阶级的忠实代理人和世界革命的战士。指责真正的革命者采取“亲华”和“亲阿”的态度，这只能吓倒一部分民族主义的、动摇的小资产阶级，而对于工人来说，这种指责只能巩固这样一个信念：我们是他们最忠实的战士，是资产阶级及其走狗不可调和的敌人。波兰共产党，英勇的波兰工人阶级的先锋队，在同美帝国主义和以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中，与正在复兴的整个马克思列宁主义运动在一起，团结在中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党周围。
    在反对国际共产主义运动和民族解放运动的敌人的斗争中，马克思列宁主义者的国际团结万岁！
    投入战斗！
    争取胜利！
    资本主义在波兰通不过！
    波兰共产党——工人阶级的党万岁！
