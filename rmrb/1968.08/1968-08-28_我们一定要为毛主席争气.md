Dear Editor,

We are members of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory stationed at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. On the evening of the 25th, when we heard Yao Wenyuan's important article "The Working Class Must Lead Everything" on the radio, transmitting Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions, we were all so excited that we couldn't sleep. Chairman Mao said: "To achieve a proletarian educational revolution, it is necessary to have the working class in the lead, with the participation of the working masses, in conjunction with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and to form a revolutionary trio with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The workers' propaganda teams should stay in the schools for a long time, participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and always lead the schools. In the countryside, schools should be managed by the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants."

Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions point out the bright path for the educational revolution, serving as a sharp weapon to thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system. It is also Chairman Mao's greatest trust, greatest support, and greatest concern for our working class. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao! We wish Chairman Mao a long, long life!

Looking at the present and thinking about the past, our working class is truly one in heaven and one on earth. In the old society, who among us workers was ever respected? The capitalists treated us like cattle, either beating us or cursing us. Now, Chairman Mao has given us the order, not only to enter the schools but also to lead the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools, to achieve the proletarian educational revolution. This is the glorious and great task that Chairman Mao has entrusted to us. Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's heart is connected with ours, the working class. Only Chairman Mao regards us, the working class, so highly, so seriously, and only the great leader Chairman Mao speaks for us, the working class, everywhere and supports us, the working class, everywhere.

With the great thought of Mao Zedong as our weapon, we can conquer everything. In the past, we relied on this weapon to defeat China's Khrushchev and the capitalist roaders in our factory, as well as those reactionary "authorities." Now, we rely on this weapon to do a good job in the educational revolution in universities and complete the great historical task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

Today, we stand before Chairman Mao's portrait and swear: Chairman Mao supports us, the working class, and we must strive for Chairman Mao, and we will not disappoint Chairman Mao's trust and expectations.

The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of workers has already entered Shanghai Jiao Tong University. We will closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, quickly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, overcome all difficulties, unite with the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, and resolutely strike down a handful of class enemies, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools, thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational line, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the educational front.

专栏：革命群众来信

    我们一定要为毛主席争气编辑同志：
    我们是上海机床厂进驻上海交通大学的工人毛泽东思想宣传队成员。二十五日晚上，当我们从广播中听到姚文元同志的重要文章《工人阶级必须领导一切》，传达了毛主席极其重要的最新指示时，大家激动得连觉也睡不着。毛主席说：“实现无产阶级教育革命，必须有工人阶级领导，必须有工人群众参加，配合解放军战士，同学校的学生、教员、工人中决心把无产阶级教育革命进行到底的积极分子实行革命的三结合。工人宣传队要在学校中长期留下去，参加学校中全部斗、批、改任务，并且永远领导学校。在农村，则应由工人阶级的最可靠的同盟者——贫下中农管理学校。”毛主席的这一光辉指示，指出了教育革命的光辉道路，是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度的锐利武器，也是毛主席他老人家对我们工人阶级最大最大的信任，最大最大的支持，最大最大的关怀。我们千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    看看现在，想想过去，我们工人阶级真是一个在天上，一个在地下。在旧社会，我们这些工人，有谁看得起我们呢？资本家拿我们当牛做马，不是挨打，就是受骂。现在，毛主席向我们发出了号令，不但要我们工人阶级进驻学校，而且还要领导学校的斗、批、改，实现无产阶级教育革命。这是毛主席交给我们的光荣伟大的任务。爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，毛主席和我们工人阶级心连心。只有毛主席才把我们工人阶级看得这么高，看得这样重，也只有伟大领袖毛主席才处处为我们工人阶级说话，处处为我们工人阶级撑腰。
    我们有伟大的毛泽东思想这个武器，就能战胜一切。过去，我们依靠这个武器，战胜了中国赫鲁晓夫和我厂的走资派以及那些反动“权威”。现在，我们依靠这个武器，同样能搞好大学的教育革命，完成毛主席交给我们的伟大的历史任务。
    今天，我们站在毛主席像前宣誓：毛主席为我们工人阶级撑腰，我们一定要为毛主席争气，决不辜负毛主席对我们的信任和希望。
    我们工人毛泽东思想宣传队已经进驻交通大学。我们一定紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，迅速落实毛主席最新指示，以无产阶级的彻底革命精神，排除万难，团结广大革命师生员工，狠狠打击一小撮阶级敌人，搞好学校的斗、批、改，彻底砸烂资产阶级教育路线，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在教育阵地上高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
