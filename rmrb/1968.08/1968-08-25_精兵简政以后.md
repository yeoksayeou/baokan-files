After the Qingdao Match Factory Revolutionary Committee was established, two rounds of streamlining were conducted in December last year and April this year, reducing the number of full-time staff from 122 to 17. After streamlining, the revolution and production presented a thriving scene. Currently, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are widespread throughout the factory, the revolutionary criticism is deepening step by step, and production tasks are completed in excess every month. From January to July, the entire factory completed the national plan comprehensively. In the situation where the leadership cadre is few and tasks are many, how did the factory's Revolutionary Committee lead the masses to grasp the revolution and promote production? The Revolutionary Committee has the following experiences.

	**Firmly Grasp the Fundamentals and Avoid Deviation**

After the Qingdao Match Factory Revolutionary Committee implemented streamlining, the work that was previously done by over 120 people was all shouldered by 17 people. The revolution must be grasped, production must be carried out, and everything from the workers' lives must be managed.

In the midst of countless tasks, what should be grasped first? The committee members, with the problems encountered in work after streamlining, sat down and repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and Vice Chairman Lin's important instruction that "forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, arm the minds of the people of the entire country with Mao Zedong Thought, and insist on Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead in all work is the most fundamental task of our party's political and ideological work." This made everyone realize that among countless tasks, the fundamentals must be grasped, and the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought must be placed at the forefront of all work. They first established Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the factory and launched a mass movement to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. All 70 workshops in the factory set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Each production workshop insisted on studying Chairman Mao's teachings before work, following Mao's instructions during work, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything.

After the study classes were widely established, the Revolutionary Committee used the study classes as a base to firmly grasp class struggle, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, and promote the great development of production. The non-full-time committee members of the factory Revolutionary Committee who work in various production workshops firmly follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," closely connect with the masses, and timely uncover the sabotage plots of class enemies. For example, the oil and drug group in the original Second Workshop has frequently had disputes and accidents in production since the Cultural Revolution. Non-full-time committee member Zhou Zishan went to this group to work alongside the workers, had heart-to-heart talks with them, armed everyone's minds with the perspective of class struggle, and together with the workers in this group, exposed a counter-revolutionary element who was inciting disunity among the masses, quickly raising the awareness and strengthening the unity of the group's comrades.

Members of the Match Factory Revolutionary Committee, in the process of going deep into the masses, insisted on highlighting proletarian politics and firmly grasping ideological education. Once, the supply of matchsticks in the First Workshop could not keep up with production needs. In the past, such a situation would have led to organizing workers for a rush job. This time, after the Revolutionary Committee member Liu Youlin, who was working alongside the group, discovered this situation, he immediately convened a meeting of workshop leaders and mass organization leaders. Everyone, with the question of "why can't the production of matchsticks keep up," studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings. Through analyzing the situation and finding the cause, everyone realized that the production could not keep up because the thinking could not keep up. Some people had become complacent and relaxed in the face of the good situation. They carried out detailed political and ideological work against this thought, and the next day, without adding more people or machines, the daily production of matchsticks on two machines jumped from 1,800 jin to 3,000 jin, fully completing the production task.

	**The Fewer People, the More Deeply They Must Go to the Grassroots**

Members of the Qingdao Match Factory Revolutionary Committee also realized from practice that after streamlining, there is still the question of whether to be high above or to go deep into the masses. Reducing the number of people does not mean connecting with the masses; only by going deep into the masses can one closely connect with the masses.

Before streamlining, the old system of this factory had nine departments, two offices, and one bureau, with a bloated and cumbersome structure. Various tedious old rules and regulations that constrained the workers' socialist initiative amounted to over 130. For example, the Labor and Wages Department and the Planning Department had six or seven full-time cadres, who were high above and rarely went deep into the grassroots, making plans that were not practical. After streamlining, one worker took on the work of these two departments. He often went deep into the workshops and among the masses, understood the situation in production, and made plans that were more practical. Because most workers went deep into the masses and timely solved problems, the past situation of opposition between cadres and the masses was broken, and a new situation of cadre-mass relations emerged.

Workers of the Qingdao Match Factory Revolutionary Committee, in going deep into the masses, followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "we go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there, this is what a good comrade should do." They went to where class struggle was most acute and complex, studied and analyzed the situation with the workers, solved problems in revolution and production, and strongly promoted the development of the entire factory's revolution and production. Members of the Revolutionary Committee deeply felt that "after streamlining, only by frequently going deep into reality and deep into the masses, solving problems at the grassroots, and solving them in their infancy, can the contradiction of few people and many tasks be overcome."

	**The People Are the Source of Power for the Revolutionary Government**

The lively fact that the organization is small and full-time personnel are few, but revolution and production are getting better and better, gave the members of the Match Factory Revolutionary Committee a profound education.

Not long after the factory streamlined, some of the new organization's workers felt that with just a dozen people directly leading 70 groups, they could not manage, and they had the idea of increasing full-time personnel. The factory Revolutionary Committee, from this ideological trend, realized that streamlining is a profound class struggle. This class struggle not only exists in the process of streamlining but also after streamlining. This idea of wanting to increase full-time personnel is actually wanting to go back on the old road, reflecting the sharp contradiction between the new revolutionary organization and the old ideas and styles of the exploiting class. In response to this situation, they organized members of the Revolutionary Committee and workers to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's great teachings that "the masses are the real heroes" and "the people have limitless creativity," making everyone realize: it is not that there are too few full-time cadres, but that there is too little Mao Zedong Thought and too little mass perspective in our minds. The poison of the capitalist-roader clique headed by China's Khrushchev, who regards himself as "Zhuge Liang" and the masses as "Ah Dou," has not been thoroughly purged. Some revolutionary leading cadres, with the lessons of their past mistakes, told everyone that the more full-time cadres there are, the farther they are from the masses. The old road of expanding the organization and increasing full-time personnel must not be taken. Only by fully mobilizing the masses' enthusiasm can we have hundreds of "cadres," and their role will far exceed that of a few full-time personnel.

After studying and carrying out revolutionary criticism, everyone's understanding unified, and members of the factory Revolutionary Committee and workers paid special attention to relying more on the masses in their work. They often, through workshop leaders and heads of mass organizations, understood the new trends, characteristics, and problems in class struggle and production struggle, and established a system of meeting with group leaders for 15 minutes before work to jointly research and solve problems, solving a large number of problems at the grassroots.

The Qingdao Match Factory Revolutionary Committee also, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching that "concentrate on major issues, decentralize minor ones. The committee decides, and various sides go to implement. Implementation also has principles, but does not deviate from them. Work inspection, the committee is responsible," changed the past practice of having to get approval from the leaders for everything. For various items of work, after the Revolutionary Committee made a decision, some specific work powers were handed over to the workshops, solving the contradiction of few people and many tasks for the Revolutionary Committee and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses, making various items of work better and better.

### 精兵简政以后

    精兵简政以后
    青岛火柴厂革命委员会建立以来，在去年十二月和今年四月先后进行了两次精兵简政，脱产的工作人员由一百二十二人减少到十七人。精兵简政以后，革命和生产出现了一派欣欣向荣的大好景象。目前，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班遍及全厂，革命的大批判步步深入，生产任务月月超额完成，一至七月份全厂全面完成了国家计划。在领导班子人少事多的情况下，是怎样带领群众抓好革命促进生产的呢？这个厂的革命委员会有以下几点体会。
      狠　抓　根　本　不　转　向
    青岛火柴厂革委会实行精兵简政后，过去一百二十多人的工作，全部落在十七个人的肩上。革命要抓，生产要搞，职工生活等等什么都要管。
    在千头万绪的工作中，首先应该抓什么？革委会的同志带着精兵简政后工作中碰到的问题，坐下来反复学习毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的伟大教导，学习林副主席“永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用毛泽东思想武装全国人民的头脑，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，是我党政治思想工作最根本的任务”的重要指示，使大家认识到，千头万绪抓根本，必须把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位。他们首先在全厂大办毛泽东思想学习班，开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。全厂七十个班组普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班。各生产班组都坚持做到班前学习毛主席的教导，班中按照毛主席的指示办事，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。
    学习班普遍办起来以后，革委会以学习班为阵地，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，推动生产的大发展。在各生产班组劳动的厂革委会的不脱产委员，坚决按照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，密切联系群众，及时识破阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。如原二车间油药小组，文化大革命以来经常闹不团结，生产上不断发生事故。不脱产委员周子山到这个小组跟班劳动，和工人同志促膝谈心，用阶级斗争的观点武装大家的头脑，与这个小组的工人一起揪出了一个挑动群众不团结的反革命分子，使这个小组的同志很快提高了觉悟，加强了团结。
    火柴厂革委会的成员在深入群众的过程中，坚持突出无产阶级政治，狠抓思想教育。一次，一车间的火柴杆子一度供应不上生产的需要，要是过去发生这种情况，就组织工人搞突击。这次，跟班劳动的革委会委员刘友林发现这一情况后，立即召开了班组长和群众组织负责人会议，大家带着“火柴杆子的生产为什么跟不上趟”这一问题，学习毛主席的有关教导。通过分析形势，找原因，大家认识到，生产跟不上趟，是因为思想跟不上趟，有些人在大好形势面前，产生了麻痹松劲情绪。他们针对这种思想又进行了细致的政治思想工作，第二天没有增人、增车，两台车生产火柴杆子的日产量都从一千八百斤跃为三千斤，完满地完成了生产任务。
          人越少越要深入基层
    青岛火柴厂革委会成员从实践中还体会到，精兵简政后，仍然有一个是高高在上、还是深入群众的问题。人减下来，并不等于联系群众了，只有深入到群众中去，才能密切联系群众。
    在精兵简政以前，这个厂的旧机构有九科、二室、一部，机构庞大臃肿，束缚工人社会主义积极性的各种烦琐的陈规旧章竟达一百三十多种。如劳动工资科和计划科就有六、七名脱产干部，他们高高在上，很少深入基层，做出的计划也不切合实际。精兵简政后，一个工作人员担起了过去这两个科的工作。他经常深入车间、深入群众，了解生产中的情况，做出的计划都比较切合实际。由于大多数工作人员深入群众及时解决问题，过去干群之间对立的局面打破了，干群关系出现了崭新的局面。
    青岛火柴厂革委会的工作人员在深入群众中，遵照毛主席“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的教导，那里阶级斗争最尖锐、最复杂，他们就到那里去，同工人一起研究、分析形势，解决革命和生产中的问题，有力地推动了全厂革命和生产的发展。革委会的同志深有体会地说：“精兵简政后，只有经常深入实际，深入群众，把问题解决在基层，解决在萌芽状态，才能克服人少事多的矛盾。”
  人民群众是革命政权力量的源泉
    机构小，脱产人员少，革命和生产反而越来越好的生动事实，使火柴厂革委会成员受到深刻的教育。
    这个厂精兵简政以后不久，新机构的工作人员中有的总感到十几个人，直接领导七十个小组，抓不过来，产生了增加脱产人员的想法。厂革委会从这个思想苗头中认识到，精兵简政是一场深刻的阶级斗争，这场阶级斗争不仅存在于精兵简政的过程中，还存在于精兵简政之后。这种又想增加脱产人员的想法实际上是想走回头路，是新的革命机构同剥削阶级的旧观念、旧作风尖锐矛盾的反映。针对这一情况，他们组织革委会成员和工作人员反复学习毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”，“人民群众有无限的创造力”的伟大教导，使大家认识到：不是脱产干部少，而是自己头脑里毛泽东思想少，群众观点少，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派那种把自己当“诸葛亮”，把群众当“阿斗”的流毒，还没有彻底肃清。有的革命领导干部以自己过去犯错误的教训对大家说，脱产干部越多，脱离群众越远，扩大机构、增加脱产人员的回头路万万不能走。只有把群众的积极性充分调动起来，我们才会有几百个“干部”，他们所起的作用会远远超过几个脱产人员。
    经过学习，经过开展革命大批判，大家的认识统一了，厂革委会的成员和工作人员都特别注意在工作中更好地依靠群众。他们经常通过班组长和群众组织的头头了解阶级斗争和生产斗争中的新动向、新特点和新问题，并建立了在班前十五分钟和小组长一起碰头的制度，共同研究解决问题，使大量问题解决在基层。
    青岛火柴厂革委会还遵照毛主席的“大权独揽，小权分散。党委决定，各方去办。办也有决，不离原则。工作检查，党委有责”的教导，改变过去什么事都要头头点头才能办的做法，对于各项工作，在革委会做出决定以后，把一些具体工作的权力交给班组，既解决了革委会人少事多的矛盾，又充分发挥了广大群众的积极性，使各项工作做得好上加好。　新华社记者
