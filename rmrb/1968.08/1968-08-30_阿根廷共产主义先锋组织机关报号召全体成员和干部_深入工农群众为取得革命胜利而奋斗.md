The organ of the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization, *El Combatiente*, recently published an article on the rectification movement carried out by this organization, calling on all members and cadres to go deep into the workers and peasants to mobilize the masses and struggle for the victory of the Argentine revolution.

The article says: “In 1967, the Communist Vanguard Organization shifted its focus of activity to the workers and peasants. As a result, it promoted the close ties between revolutionary intellectuals and the entire party with the workers and peasants, forming a flesh-and-blood relationship. At the same time, the prospect of preparing for war has become the main concern of the entire party. These two things are the most positive facts in our entire experience last year.”

The article points out that the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization, in response to the adventurist and putschist tendencies within the organization, launched a rectification movement. The article says that these erroneous ideas are mainly manifested in “disregarding the masses, disregarding the role of mass struggles in the process of preparing for armed struggle, and disregarding the leading role of the proletariat in the new democratic revolution. The result is that we have become detached from the masses and their most realistic demands, and thus also detached from the struggles of the masses, ultimately leading to a practical disregard for policies and strategies. The militarist tendency once prevailed, attempting to replace mass actions with actions by armed groups detached from the masses, which is very harmful to our organization.”

The article says that the specific measures of this rectification movement are to study Mao Zedong Thought, conduct self-criticism, analyze the tasks of our organization, and formulate political lines and work lines in various aspects based on the new guidelines that guide our actions.

The article quotes Chairman Mao’s teachings: “Different thoughts and struggles within the party are constantly occurring. This is a reflection of class contradictions and contradictions between new and old things within the party. If there are no contradictions and struggles over thoughts within the party, the life of the party will also stop.” The article says: “We advocate active ideological struggle because it guarantees party unity on a principled basis, which is beneficial for us to fight against the pro-American dictatorship and imperialism.”

The article says: The ongoing rectification movement has driven out adventurist and putschist thoughts from the Communist Vanguard Organization, bringing new vitality and inspiration to comrades, continuing the path opened in 1967: the path to the masses.

The article says: “This rectification movement, past and present, has helped us firm up our political principles. We continue to defend these correct principles. We still believe that the path of violence is the only path to seize power. Without a people’s army led by the Communist Party, it is impossible to sustain a protracted struggle until the final and complete defeat of imperialism and its local allies in our country. We still firmly believe that it is necessary to build a party armed with contemporary Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, a party composed of the vanguard of the proletariat, closely linked to the masses, with a deep understanding of the reality and class struggle history of our country, capable of organizing the broadest united front against the main enemy, capable of preparing and launching a people’s war and fighting to the final victory. We are more convinced than ever of the correctness of the strategy of people’s war and the path of establishing a solid base in the countryside, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and gradually occupying the imperialist fortresses. We affirm that our current stage of revolution is a people’s democratic revolution, and the general line of the new democratic revolution is the correct line for our current stage.” The article points out that it is necessary to use the method of class analysis, to blend in with the workers and peasants, to conduct investigations, to deepen the understanding of our society, and to formulate policies and strategies on a scientific basis.

The article calls on all members and cadres of this organization to go to the masses, to carry out intense work among the masses, to organize and mobilize the masses. The article also calls for continuing the rectification movement, vigorously promoting the principles of people’s war and the general line of the new democratic revolution.

    阿根廷共产主义先锋组织机关报号召全体成员和干部
    深入工农群众为取得革命胜利而奋斗
    新华社二十九日讯　阿根廷共产主义先锋组织机关报《不妥协报》最近就这个组织所开展的整风运动发表文章，号召全体成员和干部深入到工农群众中去进行发动群众的工作，为取得阿根廷革命的胜利而奋斗。
    文章说：“一九六七年，共产主义先锋组织把活动中心放到了工农中间。结果推动了革命知识分子和全党同工农群众紧密结合，结成血肉相连的关系。同时，准备战争的前景已成为全党关心的主要方面。这两件事是去年我们整个经历当中最有积极意义的事实。”
    文章指出，阿根廷共产主义先锋组织针对这个组织内部出现的冒险主义和盲动主义思潮，开展了一次整风运动。文章说，这种错误思想主要表现在“轻视群众，轻视群众斗争在准备武装斗争过程当中的作用，轻视无产阶级在新民主主义革命中的领导作用。其结果，使我们脱离了群众和群众最现实的要求，因而也就脱离了群众的斗争，最后造成了对政策和策略的实际上的轻视。唯军事主义思潮一度占了上风，它企图以脱离群众的武装小组的行动代替群众行动，这种思潮对我们组织实际上是十分有害的。”
    文章说，这次整风运动的具体做法是，学习毛泽东思想，进行自我批评，分析我们组织的任务，根据指导我们行动的新方针来制定政治路线和各方面的工作路线。
    文章引用毛主席的教导：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”文章说：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是在原则基础上保证党内团结，以利于我们反对亲美独裁政权和帝国主义的武器。”
    文章说：正在开展的整风运动，使共产主义先锋组织驱除了盲动主义和冒险主义思想，给同志们带来了新的活力和鼓舞，继续走
  一九六七年开创的道路：到群众中去的道路。
    文章说：“这一整风运动过去和现在都帮助我们坚定了我们在政治方面的原则立场，我们继续捍卫这些正确立场。我们依然认为，暴力道路是夺取政权的唯一道路，如果没有共产党领导的一支人民军队，就不能坚持持久的斗争，直到最后彻底打败帝国主义和它在我国的当地盟友。我们依然坚信，必须建立一个用当代马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想武装起来的党，这个党是由无产阶级先锋队组成的、密切联系群众的、对我国现实情况和阶级斗争历史有深刻了解、能够组织反对主要敌人的最广泛的统一战线、能够准备和发动人民战争并进行到最后胜利。我们比以往任何时候都更加相信人民战争的战略和在农村建立牢固的根据地、从农村包围城市、最后逐个占领帝国主义堡垒的道路的正确性。我们肯定，我们革命现阶段是人民民主革命，新民主主义革命的总路线是我国当前阶段的正确路线。”文章指出，应当用阶级分析的方法，同工农群众打成一片，进行调查，加深对我们社会的了解，从而在科学的基础上制定政策和策略。
    文章号召这个组织的所有成员和干部到群众中去，在群众当中开展紧张的工作，把群众组织起来，发动起来。文章还号召继续开展整风运动，大力宣传人民战争和新民主主义革命总路线的原则。
