According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, August 6th, according to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam: The military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam have launched continuous and ferocious attacks on the enemy in the first half of this year, eliminating 13,286 enemy personnel (including 4,693 American invaders). This number is twice the number of enemies eliminated by the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province in 1967.

In addition, under the fierce attacks of the entire province's military and civilians, 156 enemy outposts and sentry points have been forced to surrender or retreat, liberating 11 communes and more than 60 villages, freeing tens of thousands of people.

During this half-year period, the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province also sank or damaged 146 enemy ships and boats, destroyed or damaged 94 military vehicles, shot down or damaged 40 enemy aircraft, destroyed 31 cannons, burned 8 ammunition and fuel depots, blew up 11 bridges, and seized more than 1,400 pieces of various weapons as well as tons of ammunition and military supplies.

While the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched continuous and ferocious attacks on the enemy, more than 400,000 people from all walks of life in Binh Dinh Province rose up to fight against the enemy, destroying the ruling institutions of the puppet government.

The report said that the anti-war sentiment among puppet soldiers continues to rise. In the past half year, 6,183 puppet soldiers have defected from the enemy's ranks and joined the people. Among them, 52 uprisings and mutinies occurred within the puppet army. These rebellious puppet soldiers destroyed 52 enemy outposts and sentry points, eliminated hundreds of stubborn reactionaries, and brought more than 500 weapons and a large amount of military supplies to join the people.

The report said that in the first half of this year, tens of thousands of people from 70 communes in the entire province enthusiastically participated in the establishment of grassroots revolutionary governments and actively supported the frontline with manpower and resources. The liberated areas have achieved good results in the development of production and cultural and health affairs.

According to another report, on the night of July 26th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Nam Province ambushed a unit of the U.S. Marine Corps in the surrounding area of Da Nang and fiercely attacked a tank unit that came to rescue the enemy. In the first few minutes of the battle, the brave and skilled People's Liberation Armed Forces inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, killing or wounding nearly 40 American invaders and disabling one U.S. tank. Immediately afterwards, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of this province launched their third bombardment in several days on the U.S. Air Force base in Da Nang with fierce artillery fire in the early hours of the same night. Western news agencies, which obviously greatly reduced the figures, admitted that they destroyed or damaged three U.S. invader aircraft. An American officer later exclaimed in fear, "This was a very fierce attack—explosions were everywhere." Due to the severe damage to the base, some of the enemy's air units were unable to fly and carry out missions.

On the morning of July 29th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Tri Province, under the cover of strong artillery fire, bravely broke through the heavily guarded defensive lines of the enemy's Tuy Hoa base and quickly occupied part of the base, "destroying two transport planes, damaging at least one F-100 Sidewinder jet fighter and several other planes." The heavy blows from the People's Liberation Armed Forces have made the American invaders panic-stricken.

　　连续向美伪军发动猛烈进攻
　　南越槟椥省军民上半年歼敌一万三千多
　　十一个乡、六十多个村庄的人民获得解放；六千多名伪军投向人民
    据新华社河内六日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方槟椥省军民今年上半年连续向敌人发动猛烈进攻，共消灭敌人一万三千二百八十六名（其中包括美国侵略军四千六百九十三名），这个数字相当于槟椥省军民一九六七年全年消灭敌人数字的两倍。
    此外，在全省军民的猛烈打击下，有一百五十六个据点和哨所的敌人被迫投降或撤退，使十一个乡、六十多个村的成万名人民获得解放。
    在这半年内，槟椥省军民还击沉击伤敌人舰艇和船只一百四十六艘，击毁击伤军车九十四辆，击落击伤敌机四十架，击毁大炮三十一门，烧毁军火库和汽油库八座，炸毁桥梁十一座，缴获各种武器一千四百多件以及弹药和军用物资数吨。
    在人民解放武装力量向敌人发动连续和猛烈进攻的同时，槟椥省各阶层人民有四十多万人次奋起同敌人进行斗争，摧毁傀儡政权的统治机构。
    报道说，伪军士兵的反战情绪继续高涨，在半年内有六千一百八十三名伪军士兵脱离敌人的队伍投向人民。其中伪军中的爱国士兵举行了五十二次起义和兵变。这些起义的伪军，摧毁了敌人的据点和哨所五十二座，消灭了成百名顽固的反动分子，携带五百多件武器和大批军用物资投向人民。
    报道说，在今年上半年，全省七十个乡的数以万计的群众踊跃参加建立基层革命政权的工作，并且积极以人力和物力支援前线。解放区在发展生产和文化卫生事业等方面，都取得了良好的成绩。
    另据报道，七月二十六日晚间，广南省人民解放武装力量在岘港周围地区伏击一支美国海军陆战队，并且猛烈轰击前来救援的敌人一支坦克部队。战斗开始的头几分钟，英勇善战的人民解放武装力量就使敌人“遭到很大的损失”，至少打死打伤美国侵略强盗近四十名，使一辆美国坦克失去了战斗力。紧接着，这个省的人民解放武装力量在当天深夜，又以猛烈的炮火对岘港美军空军基地发动了几天来的第三次轰击，西方通讯社显然大大缩小了的数字承认，炸毁炸伤了三架美国强盗飞机。一个美国军官事后心有余悸地惊呼：“这是一次很厉害的袭击——到处都有弹药在爆炸”。由于基地遭到了严重的破坏，敌人一些航空部队无法飞行执行任务。
    七月二十九日清晨富安省人民解放武装力量，在强大炮火的掩护下，勇敢地突破了敌人绥和基地戒备森严的防线，并迅速攻占了这个基地的部分地区，“炸毁了两架运输机，炸坏了至少一架Ｆ—100佩刀式喷气战斗机和数架其他飞机”。人民解放武装力量的沉重打击，使美国侵略者惊恐万状。
