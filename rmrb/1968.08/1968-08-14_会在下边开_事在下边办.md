	Meetings Held Below, Work Done Below

	In February of this year, after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in Beizhen County, Liaoning Province, Middle Peace Commune, there was one problem that had not been solved. That is, most of the cadres were tied up with meetings and drafting documents. Whenever a meeting was held, over one hundred sixty units from the commune, production brigades, and production teams all had to participate; each unit sent one or two people, totaling two or three hundred people. Each time a meeting was held, the Revolutionary Committee had to assign several cadres to prepare for the meeting, making it extremely busy. Due to the frequent meetings, many cadres were unable to go down to the grassroots level, resulting in the phenomenon of "the director works, the standing committee watches, and the general cadres have nothing to do." Moreover, such large meetings often lasted a long time, making it difficult to concentrate, and the effect was not good; many tasks were assigned during the meeting, but the problems at the grassroots level were varied and could not be solved deeply, thoroughly, and promptly.

	In response to this situation, the Revolutionary Committee chairman organized all the cadres of the Revolutionary Committee to sit down and repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on building revolutionary committees, making everyone further realize that the question was whether to sit comfortably upstairs and let the grassroots cadres and masses walk ten or more miles to the commune to listen to us, or whether we should walk out of the office, go deep into the grassroots, conduct investigations and research, and solve the problems that the masses care about most. This is a new struggle between the old and the new, between the public and the private, and it is a matter of what direction to adhere to and what line to implement. On the basis of raising awareness, the commune Revolutionary Committee decided to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, take the path of streamlining administration, and carry out a thorough reform of the old administrative organs. On this basis, further efforts were made to strengthen the connection with the masses.

	After implementing the streamlining of administration, the commune Revolutionary Committee cadres usually left only one person to handle daily work and grasp the overall situation; the rest of the cadres were assigned to different areas to go deep into the grassroots, production brigades, and production teams, helping the masses to carry out the revolution and promote production. In this way, Chairman Mao's latest instructions, as well as documents from higher levels, were promptly conveyed to the masses by the commune cadres at the grassroots level, and they studied, discussed, and implemented them together with the masses. Necessary meetings were also held at the grassroots level. If a small meeting could be held, a large meeting was not held; if it could be completed in half a day, it was not dragged out for a full day. During the meeting, no long reports were given, leaving more time for the masses to express their opinions. In this way, it was basically achieved that meetings were held at the grassroots level and work was done at the grassroots level. For example, in previous years, the commune held a three-day spring plowing production mobilization meeting. This year, the standing committee members went down in different directions and held six meetings. Because the meetings were small, they only took one day to complete. Moreover, because the number of participants in the small meetings was large, the masses were fully mobilized, and the educational scope was wide, the result was that the sowing progress was not only faster than in previous years but also of better quality.

	Due to the thorough reform of the office work, reducing meetings, documents, and reports, and putting the popularization of Mao Zedong Thought and the prominence of proletarian politics in the first place, the commune Revolutionary Committee took a big step forward in "organizing a revolutionary and mass-connected leading cadre group." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants praised: "The Revolutionary Committee is a new cadre group, new ideas, new style, always thinking of us poor and lower-middle peasants, we trust them."

### 会在下边开　事在下边办

　　会在下边开　事在下边办
    今年二月，辽宁省北镇县中安公社成立革委会后，有一个问题没有解决，这就是大多数干部都被开会、起草文件缠住了手脚。一开会，公社和大队、生产队一百六十多个单位都得参加；一个单位来一两个人，就是二三百人。每次开会，革委会都得抽出几名干部作会议准备工作，简直忙得不可开交。由于会议多，拖着很多干部下不去，出现了“主任干，常委看，一般干部没事干”的现象。另外，这样的大会，往往会议时间长，精力很难集中，效果也不好；会上布置工作一大堆，下边的问题千差万别，很难解决得深、透、及时。
    针对这种情况，革委会主任组织革委会全体干部坐下来，反复地学习毛主席关于建设革命委员会的最新指示，使大家进一步认识到，是舒舒服服坐在上边，让基层干部、群众走十几里路，跑到公社来听我们的，还是我们走出办公室，深入下去，调查研究，解决群众最关心的问题，这是摆在革委会面前的一场新与旧、公与私的斗争，是坚持什么方向，执行什么路线的问题。在提高认识的基础上，公社革委会决心遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，走精兵简政的道路，对旧的行政机构实行彻底的改革，并在这个基础上进一步密切联系群众。
    实行精兵简政以后，公社革委会的干部，平时只留一人看家，负责处理日常工作，掌握全面情况；其余干部分片定点，全部深入基层，深入生产大队和生产队，帮助群众抓革命，促生产。这样一来，毛主席的最新指示，以及上级的文件，公社干部都在基层向群众及时作了传达，并和群众一起学习、讨论、落实。必要的会议也搬到下边去开，能开小会就不开大会，能半天结束就决不开一天。开会时不做大报告，留下较多的时间让群众广泛发表意见。这样基本上做到了会在下边开，事在下边办。如公社往年召开春耕生产动员大会，得三天才能结束。今年常委们分头下去，分六片召开，因为会小，仅用了一天时间，而且因为参加小会的人数多，群众发动充分，教育面广，结果播种进度不但比历年快，质量也好。
    由于大力改革了机关工作，减少了会议、文件、报表，把普及毛泽东思想和突出无产阶级政治放在首位，公社革委会便朝着“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”前进了一大步。广大贫下中农称赞说：革委会是新班子，新思想，新作风，处处想着咱贫下中农，咱们信得过。
