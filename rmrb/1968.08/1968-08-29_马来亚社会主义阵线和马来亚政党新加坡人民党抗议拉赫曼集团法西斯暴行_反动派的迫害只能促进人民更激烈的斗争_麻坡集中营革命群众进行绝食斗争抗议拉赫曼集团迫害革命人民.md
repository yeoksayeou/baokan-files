The Malayan Socialist Front and the Malayan Party Singapore People's Party recently issued statements protesting the Rahman puppet group's plot to murder eleven Malayan patriotic youths and the massacre of the Malayan people's fascist actions.

The Malayan Socialist Front and the Malayan "political prisoners" families issued a joint statement on July 16, pointing out that the eleven persecuted Malayan youths are innocent. They are patriots who oppose imperialism and colonialism.

The statement pointed out that the Rahman puppet group plotted to murder them because they fought against the reactionaries who looted, plundered, and killed the Malayan people. It is because they fought against the foreign imperialist invaders who oppressed and exploited the Malayan people. It is because they were sincerely loyal to Malaya and the Malayan people, and fought to liberate their homeland from the rule of American and British imperialism. The statement exposed the Rahman puppet group's attempt to use so-called "courts," "amnesty committees," and other puppet organizations to deceive the people, making their fascist crimes "legal." The statement pointed out that the Rahman puppet group can play any tricks, but their persecution and suppression of revolutionary people can only accelerate the broader and more intense struggle of the revolutionary people to achieve national liberation, further hastening the downfall of imperialists and reactionaries.

The Singapore People's Party issued a statement on August 1, stating that it must be clearly pointed out that the "sentence" of the Rahman puppet regime is completely illegal, and the Malayan (including Singapore) people firmly do not recognize it.

The statement said: "It must be clearly pointed out: the eleven Malayan revolutionary youths and all the anti-imperialist patriots currently imprisoned in Malaya (including Singapore) are the same. They, with a fearless spirit of sacrifice, resolutely launched a heroic struggle to smash 'Malaysia,' smash the 'Republic of Singapore,' to achieve the thorough liberation of Malaya (including Singapore). This is completely correct and one hundred percent in the interests of the Malayan people. They are true patriots! Rahman, Lee Kuan Yew, and the puppet regime, for the interests of their American and British imperialist masters, completely sold out the fundamental interests of the Malayan people to American and British imperialism. They are the true traitors! Therefore, those who should be sentenced to death are not the eleven revolutionary youths, but them—this handful of traitors!"

The statement said, the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, said: "The imperialist wolves should remember that the era when they could arbitrarily manipulate the fate of mankind and arbitrarily slaughter the peoples of Asia and Africa has passed." The statement continued, "We firmly believe: as long as all the oppressed and exploited Malayan compatriots unite, with revolutionary violence, resolutely counter the violent suppression of the Rahman, Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime, it can be affirmed that the Rahman, Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime will definitely be brought to the people's court by the Malayan (including Singapore) people."

The New China News Agency reported on August 27 from Kuala Lumpur: About forty revolutionary masses detained by the "Malaysia" Rahman puppet group in the Malayan southern Muar concentration camp recently carried out a hunger strike to strongly protest the Rahman puppet group's fascist atrocities against the Malayan revolutionary people.

According to reports, before these persecuted revolutionary masses began their hunger strike on August 16, they had submitted ten items of protest and sixteen demands to the Rahman puppet group. The contents of the ten items of protest included: protesting the reactionary authorities' persecution of Malayan Labor Party leaders; protesting the reactionary authorities' attempt to expel seventeen "political prisoners" from the country; protesting the reactionary authorities' plot to murder eleven Malayan patriotic youths, etc. The contents of the sixteen demands included: immediately and unconditionally releasing the "political prisoners" who were unreasonably detained; publicly investigating the incidents of "political prisoners" being tortured; not allowing the confiscation of publications and letters sent to "political prisoners"; granting "political prisoners" the freedom to listen to broadcasts, etc.

Huang Huayin, chairman of the Political Prisoners' Families Committee, told the local press on August 25 that the hunger strike of the "political prisoners" in Muar Concentration Camp had entered its tenth day. Although their bodies were weakened, their fighting spirit remained very high. Huang Huayin warned the "Malaysian" reactionary authorities that if any serious incidents happened to the "political prisoners," the authorities would be fully responsible.

    马来亚社会主义阵线和马来亚政党新加坡人民党抗议拉赫曼集团法西斯暴行
    反动派的迫害只能促进人民更激烈的斗争
    麻坡集中营革命群众进行绝食斗争抗议拉赫曼集团迫害革命人民
    据新华社讯　吉隆坡消息：马来亚社会主义阵线和马来亚政党新加坡人民党最近发表声明，抗议拉赫曼傀儡集团蓄谋杀害十一位马来亚爱国青年和屠杀马来亚人民的法西斯行径。
    马来亚社会主义阵线和马来亚“政治犯”家属在七月十六日发表的联合声明指出，十一名受迫害的马来亚青年是无罪的，他们是反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的爱国志士。
    声明指出，拉赫曼傀儡集团蓄谋杀害他们，是因为他们同那些抢劫、掠夺和杀害马来亚人民的反动派进行了斗争，是因为他们同那些镇压和剥削马来亚人民的外国帝国主义侵略者进行了斗争，是因为他们热诚地忠于马来亚和马来亚人民，为了把自己的祖国从美英帝国主义的统治下解放出来而进行了斗争。声明揭露拉赫曼傀儡集团妄图玩弄什么“法庭”、“宽赦委员会”等御用组织来蒙骗人民，使它的法西斯罪行“合法化”。声明指出，拉赫曼傀儡集团可以玩弄什么样的伎俩，但是，它们迫害和镇压革命人民只能加速革命人民更广泛、更激烈的斗争，争取民族解放，进一步加速帝国主义者和反动派走向灭亡。
    新加坡人民党八月一日发表声明说，必须严正指出，拉赫曼傀儡政权这个“宣判”是完全非法的，马来亚（包括新加坡）人民坚决不承认。
    声明说：“必须清楚地指出：十一位马来亚革命青年和所有目前仍然监禁在马来亚（包括新加坡）的反帝爱国志士一样，他们为了争取马来亚（包括新加坡）的彻底解放，以不怕牺牲的勇敢精神，坚决展开粉碎‘马来西亚’、粉碎‘新加坡共和国’的英勇斗争，这完全是正确的，是百分之百地符合马来亚人民的利益的，他们是真正的爱国者！拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权为其主子美英帝国主义的利益，把马来亚人民的根本利益完全出卖给美英帝国主义，他们才是真正的卖国者！因此，真正应该判死刑的不是十一位革命青年，而是他们——这一小撮卖国者！”
    声明说，世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：
  “帝国主义的豺狼们应该记住，由他们任意摆布人类命运、任意宰割亚非国家的时代，已经一去不复返了。”声明接着说，我们坚信：只要全体被压迫、被剥削的马来亚同胞团结起来，以革命的暴力，坚决回击拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权的暴力镇压，可以肯定，拉赫曼、李光耀傀儡政权一定要被马来亚
  （包括新加坡）人民押上人民法庭。
    新华社二十七日讯吉隆坡消息：被“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团拘禁在马来亚南部麻坡集中营的革命群众约四十人最近进行绝食斗争，强烈抗议拉赫曼傀儡集团迫害马来亚革命人民的法西斯暴行。
    据报道，这些被迫害的革命群众在八月十六日开始绝食斗争之前，曾向拉赫曼傀儡集团提出了十项抗议和十六项要求。十项抗议的内容包括：抗议反动当局迫害马来亚劳工党负责人；抗议反动当局企图将十七名“政治犯”驱逐出境；抗议反动当局蓄谋杀害十一名马来亚爱国青年等。十六项要求的内容包括：立即无条件释放被无理拘禁的“政治犯”；公开调查“政治犯”被虐待的事件；不许没收寄给“政治犯”的刊物和书信；给予“政治犯”自由收听广播的权利等。
      “政治犯”家属委员会主席黄华音二十五日对当地报界说，麻坡集中营
  “政治犯”的绝食斗争已经进入第十天，他们虽然身体衰弱，但斗争精神仍非常高昂。黄华音警告
  “马来西亚”反动当局说，如果“政治犯”有任何严重的意外发生，当局必须负全部责任。
