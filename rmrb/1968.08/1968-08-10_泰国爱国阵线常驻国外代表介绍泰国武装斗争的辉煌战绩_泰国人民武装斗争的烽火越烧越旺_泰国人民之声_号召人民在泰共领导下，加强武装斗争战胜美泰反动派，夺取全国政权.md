Thai Patriotic Front Overseas Representative Introduces the Glorious Achievements of Thailand's Armed Struggle

The Flames of Thailand's People's Armed Struggle Burn Brighter

"Thai People's Voice" Calls on the People to Intensify Armed Struggle Under the Leadership of the Thai Communist Party to Defeat the U.S.-Thai Reactionaries and Seize National Power

	BEIJING, Aug. 9 (Xinhua) — The overseas representative of the Thai Patriotic Front, Paron Chularun, held a press conference this afternoon in Beijing, detailing the glorious achievements of the Thai people's armed struggle under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party in the central, northern, northeastern, and southern regions of Thailand.

	Paron Chularun said that the sparks of the Thai people's war have now become a raging inferno in 30 out of 71 provinces across the country. The Thai people's war marks a new stage in Thai history. He said that according to incomplete statistics, from August 1967 to July 1968, the people's armed forces launched 604 attacks and battles against the enemy, killing 1,056 enemy personnel, including several American soldiers, and destroying or damaging 10 enemy aircraft of various types and numerous enemy vehicles. This year, extensive propaganda and mobilization work was also carried out. In the past three years of armed struggle, the people's armed forces have launched approximately 1,100 attacks and battles against the enemy, killing about 2,400 enemy personnel. Paron Chularun emphasized that only through armed struggle can power be seized, and only by daring to use revolutionary violence to resist, oppose, and defeat counter-revolutionary violence can the people's suffering be completely alleviated and the nation saved. He said that the great teacher Chairman Mao Zedong teaches us: "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." These teachings are universal truths of Marxism-Leninism.

	He said that the people's armed forces, following Chairman Mao's strategy and tactics for people's war, have been conducting guerrilla warfare and have always maintained the initiative in battle. He said that the reason the Thai people's armed forces have been able to grow stronger and achieve victory after victory is that they have the Thai Communist Party as their leadership core. The Thai Communist Party is a proletarian party armed with Marxism-Leninism and holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. To complete the glorious and arduous task of carrying the people's war to the end, the soldiers of the people's armed forces have responded to the party's call to study Chairman Mao's quotations and five works: "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," and "Oppose Liberalism."

	He said that the Thai people's armed forces deeply understand that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, and that the enemy's modern weapons and greater number of troops are not decisive factors. As long as the people's armed forces are armed with Mao Zedong Thought politically, ideologically, and militarily, they can overcome all difficulties and enemies. He said that the people's armed forces under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party have the political mission of expelling American imperialism, overthrowing the Sarit-Thanom traitorous clique, and establishing an independent, democratic new Thailand. They are not just fighting for the sake of fighting, but are struggling for their political mission, propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, and helping the masses build revolutionary power. Therefore, the people's armed forces not only know how to fight but also know how to produce and do mass work.

	He said that because Mao Zedong Thought is applied in the struggle, the Thai people's armed forces are becoming stronger with each battle, and their ranks are growing. He pointed out that in the past three years, the victories gained by the Thai people in the revolutionary struggle are inseparable from the victories gained by the people of various countries in their struggles against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. These victories are powerful support for the Thai people's revolutionary struggle.

	Paron Chularun said that under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party, the Thai people will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the people's war to the end.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, August 7, "Thai People's Voice" radio station broadcasted an article on August 6, expressing the determination of the Thai people to seize power through armed struggle under the leadership of the Thai Communist Party.

	The article said that in the December 1, 1966, statement marking the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Thai Communist Party, the party pointed out: The Thai people, through long and arduous struggles, have learned from their blood-stained experiences that in the struggle against the armed-to-the-teeth reactionary ruling class, without their own armed forces, they cannot defeat the enemy but will only be arrested and slaughtered. Therefore, our revolutionary path is to seize power through armed struggle. Only by daring to use revolutionary violence to decisively defeat counter-revolutionary violence can the people's suffering be completely alleviated and Thailand saved.

	The article said that the Thai Communist Party's statement is completely correct. It points the way to revolutionary victory for the Thai people, summing up the experience of several decades of revolutionary practice, and summing up the Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought on the theory of armed seizure of power. As the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, teaches: "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war."

	The article pointed out that in the past three years, the Thai people's armed forces have fought fierce battles with internal and external enemies, continuously growing stronger, which not only proves that American imperialism and the Sarit-Thanom puppet clique are paper tigers and that the people can definitely defeat them, but also strengthens the people's belief: Only by persisting in armed struggle can the people ensure the safety of their lives and property and not be slaughtered at will. If armed struggle is abandoned, there will be no place for the people, and there will be no revolutionary victory.

	The article firmly stated that the Thai people are determined to carry the armed struggle to the end, determined to seize national power through armed struggle under the correct leadership of the Thai Communist Party.

　　泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表介绍泰国武装斗争的辉煌战绩
　　泰国人民武装斗争的烽火越烧越旺
　　“泰国人民之声”号召人民在泰共领导下，加强武装斗争战胜美泰反动派，夺取全国政权
    新华社九日讯　泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖今天下午在北京举行中外记者招待会，详细介绍了泰国人民在泰国共产党的正确领导下，在泰国的中部、北部、东北部、南部展开革命武装斗争所取得的辉煌战绩。
    帕荣·朱拉暖说，目前泰国人民战争的星星之火，已经在全国七十一个府中的三十个府成为燎原之势。泰国人民战争是泰国历史发展的新阶段。他说，据不完全统计，自一九六七年八月至一九六八年七月，人民武装力量袭击敌人和同敌人战斗六百零四次，歼灭敌人一千零五十六名，其中包括美军多名，击毁击伤敌人各种类型的飞机十架，毁坏敌人军车多辆。这一年，还大力开展了宣传和发动群众的工作。在三年来的武装斗争中，人民武装力量共袭击敌人和同敌人战斗大约一千一百多次，歼灭敌人约二千四百多人。帕荣·朱拉暖强调指出，只有用人民武装斗争的方式去夺取政权，只有敢于用革命的暴力去抵抗、反对和战胜反革命的暴力，才能彻底解除人民的痛苦和挽救国家。他说，伟大的导师毛泽东主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”“枪杆子里面出政权”。这些教导是放之四海而皆准的马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。
    他说，人民武装力量遵照毛主席关于人民战争的战略战术，开展游击战争，一直掌握着战斗的主动权。他说，泰国人民武装力量所以能够日益发展壮大，并从胜利走向另一个胜利，是因为有泰国共产党作为领导核心的。泰国共产党是一个以马克思列宁主义武装起来的、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级政党。为了完成把人民战争进行到底的光荣而艰巨的任务，泰国人民武装力量的战士响应党的号召，学习毛泽东主席的语录和毛泽东主席的五篇著作：《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》。
    他说，泰国人民武装力量深刻地懂得帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，敌人的现代化武器和较多的兵力不是决定的因素，只要人民武装力量从政治上、思想上、军事上都用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能够战胜一切困难和敌人。他说，泰国共产党领导下的人民武装力量负有驱逐美帝国主义、推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，建立独立、民主的新泰国的政治使命。她不是单纯地为打仗而打仗，而是为自己的政治任务而奋斗，是为了宣传群众，组织群众，帮助群众建设革命政权。因此，人民武装力量不仅会打仗，还会搞生产和做群众工作。
    他说，由于在斗争中运用毛泽东思想，所以泰国人民武装力量越战越强，队伍日益发展壮大。他指出，三年来，泰国人民在革命斗争中获得的胜利是和各国人民在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义及一切反动派的斗争中所获得的胜利分不开的。这些胜利是对泰国人民革命斗争的有力支援。
    帕荣·朱拉暖说，在泰国共产党的领导下，泰国人民将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把人民战争进行到底。
    据新华社七日讯　“泰国人民之声”电台六日广播一篇文章，表示泰国人民决心在泰国共产党领导下，以武装斗争去夺取政权。
    文章说，泰国共产党在一九六六年十二月一日建党二十四周年的文告中指出：泰国人民经过长期顽强的斗争，以血换来的经验教训告诉我们，同武装到牙齿的反动统治阶级斗争，如果没有人民自己的武装力量，就不能战胜敌人，而只有被逮捕和屠杀。因此，我们的革命途径，就是要用人民武装斗争的方式去夺取政权。只有敢于用革命的暴力坚决地去战胜反革命的暴力，才能彻底解除人民的痛苦和拯救泰国。
    文章说，泰国共产党的文告是完全正确的。它给泰国人民指出了革命胜利的道路，是几十年来革命实践的经验总结，是坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想关于武装夺取政权理论的总结。正如世界革命人民的伟大导师毛泽东主席的教导：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”
    文章指出，三年来，泰国人民武装同内外敌人进行了激烈的战斗，不断发展壮大，这不仅证明了美帝国主义和他侬—巴博傀儡集团都是纸老虎，人民完全能够打败它，而且坚定了人民的信念：只有坚持武装斗争，人民才能确保生命财产的安全，才不致于任人宰割。如果离开了武装斗争，就没有人民的地位，就没有革命的胜利。
    文章坚决表示，泰国人民下定决心要把武装斗争进行到底，决心在泰国共产党的正确领导下，以武装斗争去夺取全国政权。
