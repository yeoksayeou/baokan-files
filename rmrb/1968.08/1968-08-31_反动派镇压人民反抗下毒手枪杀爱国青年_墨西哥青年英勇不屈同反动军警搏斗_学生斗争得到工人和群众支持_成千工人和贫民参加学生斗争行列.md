Reactionaries Kill Patriotic Youth with Guns as They Suppress People's Resistance

Mexican Youth Bravely Fight Back Against Reactionary Soldiers and Police

Student Struggles Gain Support from Workers and the Masses; Thousands of Workers and Poor Join the Student Struggle

	BEIJING, Aug. 30 (Xinhua) -- Following the massive demonstration of over 200,000 students, workers, and people from other strata in Mexico City on August 27 against the government's suppression of the people, students continued their struggle, engaging in fierce battles with reactionary soldiers and police, demonstrating their fearless and self-sacrificing spirit.

	After the demonstration on August 27, 2,000 students set up camp in front of the Presidential Palace in Zocalo Square to continue their struggle. The authorities, fearing the students' actions, dispatched 4,000 reactionary soldiers and police to suppress them in the early hours of August 28. The students bravely fought back with stones and bottles, engaging in fierce battles with the reactionary soldiers and police. As dawn broke on August 28, the students regrouped and repeatedly broke through the heavily guarded lines of armed soldiers and police, gathering in Zocalo Square to shout slogans and hold protests.

	By the afternoon of August 28, the number of students demonstrating in the square had reached about 5,000. The authorities sent a large number of troops to attack the demonstrating students, openly firing at them. The students, undeterred, fought back with glass bottles, stones, and sticks. The fierce battles lasted for several hours. That evening, another 1,000 protesters gathered in the square, and the soldiers and police opened fire again, using bayonets to charge. According to reports, in the fierce battles of that day, four students were martyred, twelve were injured, and five were arrested.

	After the students repeatedly broke through the security lines to hold demonstrations, the authorities once again dispatched heavily armed troops and over a hundred armored vehicles to guard Zocalo Square and the city center. On the morning of August 29, fully armed troops, under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, surrounded the university buildings occupied by the students, attempting to prevent them from demonstrating again. However, the students were undaunted. On the morning of August 29, 3,000 students again rushed into Zocalo Square, where they held a march and demonstration, and once again engaged in fierce battles with the fully armed soldiers and police.

	According to reports, thousands of workers living in slums and urban poor joined the students' demonstration struggle. This shows that the student struggle in Mexico is increasingly gaining the support of workers and other strata of the people.

    学生斗争得到工人和群众支持　成千工人和贫民参加学生斗争行列
    新华社三十日讯　墨西哥城消息：继墨西哥城二十多万学生、工人和其他阶层的人民群众在二十七日举行规模浩大的反对当局镇压人民的示威游行以后，学生们继续坚持斗争，同反动军警进行激烈的搏斗，表现了他们不畏强暴、不怕牺牲的英勇的斗争精神。
    二十七日示威后，二千名学生在总统府前面的索卡洛广场上扎下营地，开展斗争。当局对学生这一行动十分害怕，在二十八日凌晨出动了四千名反动军警进行镇压。学生用石块和瓶子英勇还击，同反动军警展开了搏斗。二十八日天一亮，学生重新汇集起来，几次冲破武装军警重重封锁的警戒线，在索卡洛广场上集合，高呼口号，举行抗议示威。
    到二十八日下午，在广场上举行示威游行的学生达五千名左右。当局派出大批军队前去袭击示威学生，公然向学生开枪射击。学生们毫不畏惧，用玻璃瓶、石块、棍棒进行英勇还击，激烈的搏斗持续了好几个小时。当天晚上，又有一千名示威者集结在广场上，军警又向示威者开枪，还用刺刀冲刺。据报道，在这一天的激烈搏斗中，有四名学生英勇牺牲，十二个学生受伤，五个人被逮捕。
    在学生们一再冲破警戒线举行示威以后，当局再次出动重兵和上百辆装甲车驻守在索卡洛广场和闹市区；二十九日清晨又派遣全副武装的军队在坦克和装甲车的掩护下包围了被学生占领的大学校舍，妄图阻止学生再次举行示威游行。但是，学生们不畏强暴。二十九日早上，三千名学生又冲进了索卡洛广场，在那里举行游行示威，并同全副武装的军警再一次进行了激烈的搏斗。
    据报道，有成千名居住在贫民窟的工人和城市贫民参加了学生的示威斗争。这表明，墨西哥的学生斗争正日益得到工人和其他阶层人民群众的支援。
