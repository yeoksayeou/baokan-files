The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Beiyuan People's Commune in Licheng County, Shandong Province, held a symposium in honor of the tenth anniversary of the visit of the great leader Chairman Mao to the commune. Filled with excitement, they celebrated the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, reviewed the ten-year struggle, exposed and denounced the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in slandering and sabotaging the people's commune, and resolved to follow the course charted by Chairman Mao in his call to "establish people's communes" and to forge ahead against wind and wave.

The Strong Desire of Five Hundred Million Peasants

Comrade Han Qifang, deputy director of the commune revolutionary committee and former secretary of the commune party committee, said with deep emotion after reading Chairman Mao's teaching that "the majority of peasants have a strong desire to take the socialist road... For them, there is no other way but socialism": "When Chairman Mao came to Beiyuan ten years ago, he issued the great call to 'establish people's communes,' which struck a responsive chord in the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and rural cadres. Everyone said that this was like rain after a long drought, a beacon in the vast ocean, a golden bridge to communism. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants were stirred to the depths of their souls, their blood boiling with excitement, and they rushed to establish people's communes with the spirit of seizing the day. The process of preparation took only eleven days, and on August 20, the first people's commune in the province was officially established, reporting the good news to the great leader Chairman Mao. As soon as the people's commune rose on the eastern horizon, it shone with brilliant light, displaying the unparalleled superiority of 'one big and two publics.' However, in the ten years since the establishment of the commune, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has never ceased. As soon as Chairman Mao issued the great call to 'establish people's communes,' China's Khrushchev immediately came out to oppose it. He blathered on about how 'the people's commune movement is not something that can be achieved by a single call' and slandered the commune as being 'established too early' and 'a mess,' doing everything he could to resist and sabotage it, in an attempt to stop the wheel of history and lead people down the capitalist road."

When it came to China's Khrushchev's resistance and sabotage of the people's commune movement, Comrade Zhao Tian Shan, deputy director of the commune revolutionary committee and representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants, was filled with indignation. He said: "China's Khrushchev is in the same boat as Chiang Kai-shek and Johnson. He lies through his teeth. Before Chairman Mao came to inspect Beiyuan, we poor and lower-middle peasants were all full of enthusiasm, and we discussed it in the village. We all felt that the scale of the advanced agricultural cooperatives was too small and their strength too weak, and that we couldn't give full play to our enthusiasm for building socialism or achieve a greater increase in production. At that time, some people advocated establishing large cooperatives, others were considering joint cooperatives, and still others wanted to organize collective farms or large farms. What should we do? No one had a clear idea. Just at this critical moment, Chairman Mao himself came among us poor and lower-middle peasants, investigated the situation in the countryside, understood our demands, and pointed out the bright road of the people's commune. Chairman Mao truly has a heart-to-heart connection with the poor and lower-middle peasants. He knew what we were thinking and what we wanted to do. Just when we were at a loss, he pointed out the direction for us to advance. Can it be said that the people's commune was established too early? We say that the people's commune was established neither too early nor too late, but just at the right time. After the establishment of the people's commune, the whole commune underwent earth-shaking changes the following year. We poor and lower-middle peasants all felt that we could never express in words how good the people's commune is, and we could never thank Chairman Mao enough. When we worked, we thought of Chairman Mao, and we had boundless energy. Establishing the people's commune is the strong desire of our five hundred million peasants. China's Khrushchev blathers on about how 'the people's commune movement is not something that can be achieved by a single call.' This is a barefaced attack on our great leader Chairman Mao. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants will resolutely fight to the end."

The Results of the Struggle Between the Two Lines

Comrade Zhang Hongyun, former brigade leader of Yangzhuang Brigade and now the main leader of the brigade leadership group, who has had the honor of seeing Chairman Mao twice, has resisted the evil activities of China's Khrushchev and his agents in sabotaging the people's commune and has upheld the socialist direction. At the symposium, he enthusiastically praised the unparalleled superiority of the 'one big and two publics' of the people's commune and denounced the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in denying the superiority of the 'one big and two publics.' He said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that revolution is to liberate the productive forces and that revolution is to promote the development of the productive forces. The great changes in our brigade over the past ten years are the result of the liberation of the productive forces. The establishment of the people's commune has promoted the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses of members. The 'private' character that has been deeply rooted in people's minds for thousands of years has been further resisted, and the 'public' character has taken the lead. Everyone follows the road pointed out by Chairman Mao and builds socialism with increasing enthusiasm. Under the joint efforts of the members, the rolling waters of the Yellow River flow into the newly opened paddy fields, various water conservancy projects are spread throughout the commune, and commune-run industries, orchards, and fisheries have also been established. The yield of various crops has also been greatly increased. The average yield per mu of grain in the whole brigade has increased from four or five hundred jin in the period of the advanced agricultural cooperatives to over one thousand jin; the average yield per mu of vegetables has increased from over eight thousand jin to fifteen thousand jin; the yield of lotus roots has also exceeded the historical highest level, reaching over one thousand jin per mu. With the development of production, the contributions to the state have increased, and the living standards of the members have also improved step by step. All this is the result of the poor and lower-middle peasants listening to Chairman Mao's words and giving full play to the superiority of the 'one big and two publics' of the people's commune. China's Khrushchev blathers on about how 'the superiority of 'one big and two publics' is not obvious at present' and 'there is only so much superiority at present, and no more.' What kind of tone is this! During the period of temporary economic difficulties caused by the three years of natural disasters, the black wind blown by China's Khrushchev reached Beiyuan Commune. His agents in Shandong also tried every means to destroy this commune, which was the first to be established in the province. A handful of capitalist roaders within the county and commune party organizations wanted to use our brigade as a pilot for the 'three selfs and one contract' and promote the contract responsibility system for vegetable production to households. At that time, our brigade cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants thought, Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us to take the road of collectivization, so why do they want to pull the brake when they encounter a little difficulty? Everyone thought of Chairman Mao and felt that their actions were wrong, and their backs were stiffer. They resolutely pushed back the attempt. Then, they insisted on breaking up our four brigades' collective orchard. Everyone expressed strong opposition. The capitalist roaders in the commune did not give up. They came up with a hardline approach, forcing us to downsize, and said that I was the ringleader. They also had a private talk with me, trying to force me to yield and surrender. At that time, the more I thought about it, the more I felt that they were not on the same road as Chairman Mao. If I yielded, I would betray Chairman Mao's affectionate concern and repeated instructions to Beiyuan. When I thought of Chairman Mao, my eyes were clear, my mind was bright, and my courage was boosted. I said angrily in front of the capitalist roaders in the commune, 'You are implementing policies that are not Chairman Mao's, and you do not represent the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants. If you dare to break up the orchard, I will fight to the end with you!' The handful of capitalist roaders within the commune party were afraid of being exposed, and they never dared to mention the matter again."

The Mighty Power of 'One Big and Two Publics'

The more we criticized, the more we hated China's Khrushchev, the more we loved the great leader Chairman Mao, and the deeper we understood the superiority of the 'one big and two publics' of the people's commune. Ten years ago, when the great leader Chairman Mao inspected Beiyuan, Comrade Li Shucheng, former chairman of Shuitun Advanced Agricultural Cooperative and now the leader of the Shuitun Brigade leadership group, who had the honor of shaking hands with and having a warm conversation with Chairman Mao, has, in the past ten years, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of 'establishing people's communes is good' and waged a resolute struggle against the evil activities of China's Khrushchev and his agents in sabotaging the people's commune, defending Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions. He has a particularly deep understanding of the superiority of the people's commune. He said: "In the past ten years of practice, we have deeply felt that the people's commune, this new social and economic organization that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is beneficial to highlighting proletarian politics and turning the countryside into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought; it is beneficial to the poor and lower-middle peasants firmly grasping the reins of power and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat; it is beneficial to continuously strengthening the collective economy and adhering to the socialist road; it is beneficial to consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants and strengthening the relationship between urban and rural areas; it is beneficial to transforming nature, resisting natural disasters, and developing agricultural production; it is beneficial to unifying the arrangement of planting areas and bringing production into the orbit of the state plan; it is beneficial to the all-around development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, and to making full use of manpower, land, and materials; it is beneficial to continuously increasing public accumulation and expanding reproduction; it is beneficial to popularizing education and raising the political and cultural level of the masses. In a word, the advantages of the people's commune are countless. China's Khrushchev, in order to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism, blathers on about how 'the superiority of 'one big and two publics' is not obvious at present.' This is a vicious attack on the people's commune. We will never allow China's Khrushchev to belittle Chairman Mao's great call, and we will never allow China's Khrushchev to drag us back to the old society of exploitation."

Old poor peasant Xu Fengshan of Shuitun Brigade said with deep emotion: "We have felt that individual farming is like a small boat, which capsizes when it encounters a storm; an agricultural cooperative is like a small sailboat, which rocks when it encounters a storm; a commune is like a large ship, which sails against the wind and waves forever. Just in terms of resisting natural disasters, the people's commune shows the mighty power of 'one big and two publics' even more. In 1937, Beiyuan suffered a flood disaster, and the poor peasants' shacks were almost all destroyed, with most of them fleeing to other places, and some of them still missing. In 1962, our Beiyuan Commune suffered a major flood disaster, with 290 millimeters of rain falling in just two or three hours. However, with Chairman Mao's concern and the unparalleled superiority of the 'one big and two publics' of the commune, the cadres, masses, and the flood disaster waged a tenacious struggle. After four days and five nights of fighting, the accumulated water was drained away. In order to be self-reliant and overcome difficulties, under the harsh conditions of continuous rain, everyone displayed the revolutionary heroism of fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous fighting, fighting against nature, fighting against the earth, planting after flooding, and flooding after planting. In this way, after five floods and five plantings, the vegetable seedlings were finally saved. The flooded rice was rescued by draining the water, washing away the dirt, and urgently applying fertilizer. In the autumn, a bumper harvest of vegetables and rice was still achieved, showing the boundless vitality of the people's commune."

Everyone expressed that in the past ten years, the people's commune has become better and better. These ironclad facts are indisputable. We must criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist fallacies thoroughly. The more China's Khrushchev opposes the people's commune, the more we must follow the great leader Chairman Mao and take the road of the people's commune. We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and let the great red flag of the people's commune fly forever!

　　让人民公社伟大红旗万代飘扬
　　——山东历城县北园公社贫下中农和革命干部痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫否定人民公社一大二公优越性的罪行
    山东历城县北园公社的贫下中农和革命干部，在纪念伟大领袖毛主席亲临视察十周年的光辉日子里，怀着激动的心情，举行座谈会，热烈庆祝毛主席革命路线的辉煌胜利，回顾十年来的战斗历程，揭发控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人诬蔑破坏人民公社的滔天罪行，决心沿着毛主席指引的“还是办人民公社好”的航向，乘风破浪，奋勇向前。
    五亿农民的强烈愿望
    公社革委会副主任、原公社党委书记韩其芳，读过毛主席“大多数农民有一种走社会主义道路的积极性。……对于他们说来，除了社会主义，再无别的出路”的教导以后，回想到十年前毛主席亲临北园乡视察的情景，激动地说：毛主席在北园发出“还是办人民公社好”的伟大号召，字字说到了广大贫下中农和农村干部的心坎上，大家说，这是久旱送来的及时雨，大海航行送来的指路灯，是为咱奔向共产主义搭起的金桥。广大贫下中农心潮澎湃，热血沸腾，以只争朝夕的革命精神加紧筹办人民公社，尽早实现自己的愿望。筹建的过程，只用了十一天，八月二十日就正式宣告全省第一个人民公社的诞生，向伟大领袖毛主席报喜。人民公社从东方的地平线上一升起，就光芒四射，显示出一大二公的无比优越性。可是，建社十年来，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，一刻都没有停息过，毛主席刚刚发出“人民公社好”的伟大号召，中国赫鲁晓夫就立即出来反对。他胡说什么“人民公社化运动不是什么人喊一下就会出现的。”诬蔑公社“办早了”，“办糟了”，千方百计地进行抵制破坏，妄图阻止历史车轮的前进，把人们引向资本主义的邪道。
    一提到中国赫鲁晓夫对人民公社化运动的抵制破坏，早就引起了贫下中农代表、公社革委会副主任赵天山的气愤。他说：中国赫鲁晓夫和蒋介石、约翰逊是一路货，他瞪着眼说瞎话。毛主席来咱北园视察前，俺们贫下中农都鼓着一把劲，在村里就议论开了，都觉得高级农业社规模小、力量薄，大伙建设社会主义的劲使不出来，不能更大幅度的增产。当时，有的人主张要办大社，有的酝酿搞联社，还有的要组织集体农庄、办大农场，到底怎么办？谁也没有个准头。就在这个火口上，毛主席亲自来到咱们贫下中农中间，调查了农村的情况，了解了咱农民的要求，指出了走人民公社的光明大道。毛主席真是和贫下中农心连心，他老人家知道俺在想什么，要做什么，正在我们拿不定主意的时候，给我们指出了前进的方向，这能说人民公社办早了吗？我们说人民公社办得不早不晚，正是火候。人民公社建立以后，第二年全社就起了地覆天翻的变化。俺们贫下中农都觉得，千言说不尽人民公社好，万语谢不尽毛主席他老人家的恩，干活想起毛主席，浑身就有使不完的劲。办人民公社，是俺们五亿农民的强烈愿望。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说：“人民公社化运动不是什么人喊一下就会出现的”。这是明目张胆地对我们伟大领袖毛主席的恶毒攻击。谁反对毛主席俺贫下中农就坚决和他拚。
    两条路线斗争的结果
    两次幸福地见到过毛主席的原杨庄大队长、现大队领导班子主要负责人张洪运，曾经抵制过中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人破坏人民公社的罪恶活动，坚持了社会主义方向。他在座谈会上，以本队十年来铁的事实，热情赞扬人民公社一大二公的无比优越，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人否定人民公社一大二公优越性的罪行。他说，毛主席教导咱：革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展。俺们大队十年的巨大变化，就是生产力解放了的结果。人民公社的建立，促进了广大社员的思想革命化。几千年来在人们头脑中的私字，进一步受到了抵制，公字领了先，大伙照着毛主席他老人家引的路，建设社会主义的劲越来越大。在社员的共同努力下，滚滚的黄河水流进了新开辟的稻田，各种水利工程遍布全社，社办工业、果园、渔场也随着兴办起来。各种作物的产量，也大大提高，全大队粮食平均亩产由高级农业社时期的四五百斤，达到了千斤以上；蔬菜由平均亩产八千多斤，增长到一万五千斤；藕的产量也超过历史上最高水平，亩产达到千斤以上。随着生产的发展，对国家的贡献大啦，社员的生活也步步提高。这都是贫下中农听毛主席的话，充分发挥人民公社一大二公优越性的结果。中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“当前‘一大二公’的优越性还不明显，当前只有这么多优越性，再多也不行。”这是什么腔调！在三年自然灾害造成暂时经济困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫吹起的阵阵黑风，刮到了北园公社，他在山东的代理人，也想方设法，企图把这个全省建立最早的人民公社搞垮。县和公社党内的一小撮走资派，想在我们大队搞“三自一包”的试点，推行蔬菜包产到户。当时俺们队的干部、贫下中农就琢磨，毛主席一再教导我们要走集体化道路，为什么碰到一点困难，他们就想拉倒车。大伙一想到毛主席，更觉得他们的这种作法不对，腰杆更硬棒啦，就坚决把它顶回去。接着，他们又硬要拆散俺们四个大队集体经营的果园，大伙都表示坚决反对。公社的走资派并没死心，他们又来了硬法子，逼着俺们非下放不可，并说我是挡头，又和我个别谈话，逼我让步投降。当时，我越想越觉得他们走的和毛主席不是一条路，如果我让步，就辜负了毛主席对北园的亲切关怀和谆谆教导。一想到毛主席，我眼明心亮，胆子壮了，我当着公社走资派的面，愤怒地说：“你们执行的不是毛主席的政策，不代表贫下中农的利益，你要真敢拆散了果园，我非和你们斗到底不可！”公社党内一小撮走资派作贼心虚，从此没敢再提这事。
    一大二公力大无穷
    越批判，大家对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨，对伟大领袖毛主席越亲，对人民公社一大二公的优越性体会越深刻。十年前伟大领袖毛主席视察北园时，曾和毛主席亲切握手、热情交谈过的原水屯高级农业社社长、现水屯大队领导班子负责人李树诚，在过去的十年中，一直遵循毛主席“还是办人民公社好”的教导，与中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人破坏人民公社的罪恶活动，进行坚决斗争，捍卫了毛主席的光辉指示。他对人民公社的优越性体会的格外亲切。他说：十年的实践中，我们深刻体会到：人民公社这个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的崭新的社会经济组织，有利于突出无产阶级政治，把农村办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校；有利于贫下中农牢牢掌握印把子，加强无产阶级专政；有利于不断壮大集体经济，坚持社会主义道路；有利于密切城乡关系，巩固工农联盟；有利于改造自然，抗拒自然灾害，发展农业生产；有利于统一安排种植面积，把生产纳入国家计划轨道；有利于农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展，做到人尽其才、地尽其力、物尽其用；有利于不断增加公共积累，扩大再生产；有利于普及教育，提高群众的政治文化水平。总之，一句话，人民公社的好处说不完。中国赫鲁晓夫为了达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，胡说什么“当前‘一大二公’的优越性还不明显”，这是对人民公社的恶毒攻击。我们绝不允许中国赫鲁晓夫贬低毛主席的伟大号召，绝不允许中国赫鲁晓夫把我们拉回吃人的旧社会。
    水屯大队老贫农许凤山满怀激情地说：俺们体会到：单干好比小舢板，一遇风浪底朝天；农业社好比小帆船，遇到风浪颠几颠；公社好比大轮船，乘风破浪永向前。单就抗拒自然灾害来说，人民公社更加显示出一大二公力大无穷。一九三七年北园遭受水灾，穷人住的窝棚，没剩下几间，大部分贫下中农逃往他乡，有的至今还不知下落。一九六二年，我们北园公社遭受了特大的水灾，两三个小时，降雨二百九十多毫米。但是，有毛主席的关怀，有公社一大二公的无比优越性，干部、群众和水灾展开了英勇顽强的斗争，经过四天五夜的奋战，就排除了积水。为了自力更生战胜困难，在阴雨连绵的艰难条件下，大伙发扬不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的革命英雄主义的气概，与天斗，与地斗，种了淹，淹了再种。就这样，经过五淹五种，终于拿住了菜苗。受淹的水稻经过放水洗污，紧急追肥，也很快挽救过来。秋后，仍然获得了蔬菜、水稻双丰收，显示了人民公社无穷的生命力。
    大家表示：十年来，人民公社越办越好，这些铁的事实，是中国赫鲁晓夫抹煞不了的。我们要批深批透批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论。中国赫鲁晓夫越是反对人民公社，我们越要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，走人民公社化的道路。我们要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让人民公社的伟大红旗万代飘扬！
