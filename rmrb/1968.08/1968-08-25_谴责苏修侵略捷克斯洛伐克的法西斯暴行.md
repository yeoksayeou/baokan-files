The New Zealand Communist Party Issues a Solemn Statement
Condemning the Soviet Revisionists' Fascist Atrocities in Czechoslovakia

The statement points out: The working class and people of Czechoslovakia have only one path to return to socialism, and that is the revolutionary path. They must rise up to overthrow all the fake communists in their own country—including the followers of Dubček and the Soviet revisionist leaders.

New Zealand, August 23 (Xinhua) The New Zealand Communist Party issued a statement titled "The Truth About the Situation in Czechoslovakia" on August 23, solemnly condemning the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's brazen deployment of large numbers of troops to militarily occupy Czechoslovakia. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union and other satellite countries shows that the Soviet leaders are actually imperialists, not communists. Since Khrushchev, they have abandoned socialism and restored capitalism in the Soviet Union. Now, their actions are like those of big capitalist countries towards small capitalist countries.

The New Zealand Communist Party warned them five years ago that this was the path they were taking. Today's developments have proven this to be true.

When the Soviet ruling clique, under Khrushchev's control, took the capitalist road, they threatened and enticed the communist leaders of Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries to follow the same path. So far, two traitorous groups have been overthrown.

Under the presidency of Novotný, Czechoslovakia restored capitalism, and this regime was overthrown by Dubček and his group earlier this year. However, while Novotný was retreating towards capitalism, he willingly allowed Czechoslovakia to become a satellite of the Soviet Union, while Dubček and his group wanted to completely break away from the Soviet orbit and openly cooperate with Western capitalism.

The foundation for this was laid during Novotný's rule. His group gradually restored capitalism, creating a new bourgeoisie of high-salaried bureaucrats and "enterprise managers," while also giving new impetus to the old capitalist forces that had not been eliminated. These new and old capitalist forces put Dubček in power, using "democratic reforms" as a cover to carry out open counter-revolution.

But the main culprits are those in the Kremlin. They are representatives of the new capitalist clique that seized power in a great socialist country formerly ruled by the working class.

They are not communists but ambitious individuals who seek a life of wealth and comfort at the expense of the working people.

When Brezhnev and Kosygin supported Khrushchev in pulling the Soviet Union back to capitalism, they claimed they were creatively developing the teachings of Marx and Lenin—the great communist doctrine, Marxism-Leninism—and thus deceived many people. In reality, they have distorted this doctrine beyond recognition. Their revision of communist principles has split the world communist movement.

The New Zealand Communist Party stands with China and Albania in opposing Soviet revisionism. They remind people that the Soviet leaders are betraying the workers of the Soviet Union and the world, and that Soviet policy will lead to a retreat to capitalism and imperialism. They have been proven right.

The spokesmen and newspapers of capitalism attempt to use Russia's actions to besmirch the reputation of socialism and communism, but any worker with true insight will see through this. They will know that the Soviet leaders are fake communists. Therefore, the actions of the Soviet leaders do not besmirch the reputation of true socialism, which is thriving in China and Albania.

The Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia means that the working class and people of Czechoslovakia will live under a Russian-style capitalist system, not a Western-style capitalist system. They have only one path to return to socialism, and that is the revolutionary path. They must rise up to overthrow all the fake communists in their own country—including Dubček and the followers of the Soviet leaders.

At that time, they will take this path. The Soviet people will do the same.

### 谴责苏修侵略捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯暴行

    新西兰共产党发表严正声明
    谴责苏修侵略捷克斯洛伐克的法西斯暴行
    声明指出：捷克斯洛伐克的工人阶级和人民，要回到社会主义只有一条道路可走，那就是革命的道路，起来革本国一切冒牌的共产党人——包括杜布切克和苏修领导人的追随者——的命
    新华社惠灵顿二十三日电　新西兰共产党二十三日发表题为《捷克斯洛伐克情况真相》的声明，严正谴责苏修叛徒集团悍然出动大批军队，对捷克斯洛伐克实行军事占领的滔天罪行。声明全文如下：
    苏联和其他仆从国部队对捷克斯洛伐克实行军事占领表明，苏联领导人实际上是帝国主义者，而不是共产党人。自赫鲁晓夫以来，他们就已经在苏联抛弃了社会主义，复辟了资本主义。现在，他们的行为，就象大国的资本家对待小国的资本家。
    新西兰共产党五年前曾当面告诉他们，这是他们正在走的道路。今天的事态证明了这一点。
    在苏联统治集团在赫鲁晓夫的控制下走资本主义道路的时候，他们威吓利诱捷克斯洛伐克和其他东欧国家的共产党领导人也走同样的道路。到现在为止，已经有两伙叛徒垮台了。
    捷克斯洛伐克在总统诺沃提尼的政权下复辟了资本主义，这个政权在今年早些时候被杜布切克及其集团搞掉了。但是，诺沃提尼在向资本主义倒退的同时，甘心情愿让捷克斯洛伐克充当苏联的附庸，而杜布切克及其一伙则要完全脱离苏联的轨道，公开同西方资本主义携手合作。
    在诺沃提尼统治时期就已经为此打下基础。他的集团逐步复辟资本主义，出现了高薪官僚和“企业经理”这种新的资产阶级，同时还给了根本没有被消灭的旧资本主义势力以新的动力。这些新旧资本主义势力把杜布切克捧上台，利用“民主改革”为幌子，进行公开的反革命。
    但是，主犯是在克里姆林宫的那些人。他们是在以前由工人阶级统治的一个伟大的社会主义国家中篡夺了政权的新资本主义集团的代表。
    他们不是共产党人，而是在牺牲劳动人民的情况下为自己和新官僚经理阶级谋求富裕舒适的生活的野心家。
    当勃列日涅夫和柯西金支持赫鲁晓夫把苏联拉回到资本主义去的时候，他们胡说他们创造性地发展了马克思和列宁的教导——伟大的共产主义学说，即马克思列宁主义，从而欺骗了许多人。实际上他们把这个学说修改得面目全非。他们对共产主义原则的修正，分裂了世界共产主义运动。
    新西兰共产党同中国和阿尔巴尼亚站在一起反对苏联修正主义。她们提醒人们注意，苏联领导人正在出卖苏联和全世界的工人，苏联的政策将导致向资本主义和帝国主义倒退。事实证明她们是对的。
    资本主义的代言人和报纸企图利用俄国的行动来败坏社会主义和共产主义的名誉，但是任何有真知灼见的工人都会识破这点。他们会知道，苏联领导人是冒牌的共产党人。因此，苏联领导人的行动败坏不了真正的社会主义的名誉，真正的社会主义正在中国和阿尔巴尼亚欣欣向荣。
    苏联占领捷克斯洛伐克意味着，捷克斯洛伐克的工人阶级和人民生活在俄国式的资本主义制度下，而不是生活在西方式的资本主义制度下。他们要回到社会主义只有一条道路可走，那就是革命的道路，起来革本国一切冒牌的共产党人——包括杜布切克和俄国领导人的追随者——的命。
    到时候，他们就会走这条道路。苏联人民也会这样做。
