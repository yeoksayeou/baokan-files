The editorial board of "Red Flag" magazine: We present to our readers the commentary "We Must Poke the Wasp's Nest," which clearly explains the essence of the so-called "persistent problems" and the methods to solve them. The fundamental issue is still the class struggle, the issue of who holds the leadership. The method of sending Shanghai's worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to units with "persistent problems" is very good. The working class should not only play a leading role in the cultural revolution of industrial enterprises but also fully play its leading role in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of all sectors of the superstructure. This is a major event. Winning this battle will ensure the overall victory of the cultural revolution of the proletariat.

Currently, the revolutionary situation in Shanghai is excellent. However, amidst this excellent situation, we must also clearly see that there are still some "persistent problem" units on various fronts. These units neither struggle, nor criticize, nor transform. If they struggle, it is through armed conflict. Although these units are few in number, their influence is bad. They have become obstacles to the development of the excellent situation and the full victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, becoming harmful elements and backward corners. We must poke these "persistent problem" wasp's nests. This is necessary to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to deepen the struggle against the enemy, to grasp the revolution and promote production, to launch a new wave of revolution and production, to develop the excellent situation, and to achieve the overall victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. It is also the strong demand of the broad revolutionary masses.

Under the great call of the two "proclamations" of the Central Committee and the great encouragement of Chairman Mao's gift to the Beijing Workers and Peasants Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, Shanghai's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, composed mainly of revolutionary workers and in a tripartite alliance, numbering in the hundreds, have already entered the "persistent problem" units. They directly convey Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the voice of the proletarian headquarters to the broad masses. The masses have been mobilized, and the situation has greatly improved, presenting a very inspiring new scene. The "persistent problem" caps are being thrown into the trash one by one. This shows that "persistent problems" not only must be solved but can also be completely solved.

Where is the difficulty with "persistent problems"? In some units, the difficulty lies in "bad people in power, good people suppressed." In these units, a handful of bad people have usurped the leadership. They "resist externally and control internally," "block upwards and oppress downwards," suppress the masses, retaliate, and carry out white terror, ruling by force. What is particularly serious is that they block the voice of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, deceiving and misleading the masses, making their units into independent kingdoms where "water cannot seep in, and needles cannot penetrate." For these units, we must firmly support the masses, mobilize the masses, blow open the lid of class struggle, and carry out the struggle for power, seizing the leadership back into the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries.

The "persistent problems" are also difficult because some leaders have been poisoned by the reactionary "multi-center theory" and are full of bourgeois factionalism. They occupy mountains as kings, recognize friends as enemies, believe in "power begets authority," and advocate "me first." These leaders have detached themselves from the workers, peasants, soldiers, residents, and the majority of the masses. Even those who support their faction are not happy. For these leaders, we must mobilize the masses to supervise them.

To solve "persistent problems," fundamentally, we must rely on the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought and the masses rising up. The class enemies fear these two things the most. As long as we arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and mobilize the masses, a handful of class enemies, whether they are performing on stage, shining brightly for a moment, or hiding in the background, plotting in secret rooms, will immediately reveal their true colors and become a pile of dog shit despised by humanity. The fundamental task of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams is to firmly implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, quickly, accurately, and comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's every latest instruction and the voice of the proletarian headquarters into the masses, making it the conscious action of the masses. The work of the propaganda teams must be both spectacular, creating a strong political offensive, and solid, doing in-depth, detailed, and arduous ideological and political work, truly mobilizing the masses ideologically.

Solving "persistent problems" is a sharp and intense class struggle. "When the representatives of various exploiting classes find themselves in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current survival and future development, they often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend themselves." A handful of class enemies are using various despicable means to engage in sabotage. They attempt to sow discord between the propaganda teams and the masses. They shout, "We have withstood a 12-level typhoon before, and we will withstand a 24-level typhoon this time," to maintain the wavering morale and strengthen internal control. They roar, "Don't jump, Sun Wukong cannot escape from the Buddha's palm," attempting to frighten the masses and cover up the volcano that is already smoking. They also set up defenses, create disturbances, cause accidents, disrupt production, and try to shift the direction of the struggle, obstructing the development of the movement. However, all of this is like lifting a stone to drop on one's own foot. We must launch a powerful struggle against the enemy. A small handful of class enemies who dare to resist will inevitably be completely, thoroughly, cleanly, and entirely annihilated by the broad revolutionary people.

    马蜂窝就是要捅
    上海《工人造反报》社论
    《红旗》杂志编者按：我们向读者介绍《马蜂窝就是要捅》这篇评论，它把所谓“老大难”的本质及解决的方法，都说清楚了。根本的问题还是阶级斗争问题，是领导权掌握在什么人手里的问题。上海派工人毛泽东思想宣传队到有“老大难”问题的单位去的办法很好。工人阶级不但应当在工厂企业的无产阶级文化大革命中发挥领导作用，而且应当在上层建筑的各个领域的斗、批、改中充分发挥自己的领导作用。这是一件大事。打好这一仗，无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利就有保障了。
    当前，上海革命形势大好。但是，在大好形势中，我们也要清醒地看到各条战线上还存在一些“老大难”单位。这些单位一不斗，二不批，三不改。斗是斗，就是搞武斗。这些单位为数不多，但是影响很坏，已经成为发展大好形势的阻力，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的障碍，成为害群之马，落后的死角。对这些“老大难”的马蜂窝就是要捅。这是落实毛主席一系列最新指示的需要，是深入开展对敌斗争的需要，是狠抓革命，猛促生产，掀起革命、生产新高潮的需要，是发展大好形势，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的需要，也是当前广大革命群众的强烈要求。
    在中央两个“布告”的伟大号召下，在毛主席给北京工农毛泽东思想宣传队赠送珍贵礼物的巨大鼓舞下，上海以工人革命造反派为主体的、三结合的，数以百计的毛泽东思想宣传队，已经进入了“老大难”单位，把毛主席的最新指示和无产阶级司令部的声音直接地传达给广大群众。广大群众发动起来了，局面大为改观，出现了极为鼓舞人心的一片新景象，“老大难”的帽子正在一顶顶地被扔到垃圾桶里去。由此可见，“老大难”不仅必须解决，也是完全能够解决的。
      “老大难”难在那里？有少数单位，就是“难”在“坏人掌权，好人受气”。在这些单位里，一小撮坏人篡夺了领导权，他们“对外抵制，对内控制”，“对上封锁，对下高压”，压制群众，打击报复，实行白色恐怖，大搞武力统治。特别严重的是，封锁以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的声音，蒙蔽和欺骗群众，使自己单位成为“水泼不进，针插不进”的独立王国。对这些单位，就要坚决支持群众，放手发动群众，炸开阶级斗争盖子，开展夺权斗争，把领导权重新夺回到无产阶级革命派的手中。
      “老大难”还“难”在有些头头中了反动的“多中心论”的毒，资产阶级派性十足。他们占山为王，认友为敌，迷信“实力底下出政权”，大搞“以我为中心”。这些头头脱离了工人，脱离了农民，脱离了战士，脱离了居民，脱离了群众的大多数，群众都不高兴，就连拥护他一派的也有人不高兴。对这些头头，要发动群众起来对他们实行监督。
    解决“老大难”，归根到底，一要靠毛泽东思想的无穷威力，二要靠群众起来。阶级敌人最最害怕的就是这两条。只要我们用毛泽东思想武装群众，发动群众，一小撮不管是登台表演，煊赫一时，还是隐藏幕后，策划密室的阶级敌人，就会立即现出原形，成为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。毛泽东思想宣传队的根本任务，就是要坚定地执行毛主席的革命路线，迅速、准确、全面地把毛主席的每一个最新指示，无产阶级司令部的每一个声音，落实到群众中去，成为群众的自觉行动。宣传队的工作既要轰轰烈烈，造成强大的政治攻势，又要扎扎实实，做深入的、细致的、艰苦的思想政治工作，把群众真正从思想上发动起来。
    解决“老大难”，是一场尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争。“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”一小撮阶级敌人正在用种种卑鄙的手法，进行阴谋破坏。他们妄图挑拨宣传队和群众的关系。他们叫嚷“过去十二级台风也顶住了，这次二十四级台风也要顶得住”，以此维持动摇的军心，加强内部控制。他们叫嚣“不要跳，孙悟空翻不出如来佛的手心”，妄图吓住群众，捂住已经在冒烟的火山。他们还道道设防，进行干扰，制造事故，破坏生产，力图转移斗争大方向，阻挠运动的开展。但是，这一切都是搬起石头打自己的脚。我们要开展一场声势浩大的对敌斗争，敢于顽抗的一小撮阶级敌人必将被广大革命人民坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭。
