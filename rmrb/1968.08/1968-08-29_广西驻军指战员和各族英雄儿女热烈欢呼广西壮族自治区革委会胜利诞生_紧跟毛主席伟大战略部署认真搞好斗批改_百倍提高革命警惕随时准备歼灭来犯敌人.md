The people of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, totaling 24 million from various ethnic groups, who are fighting on the front lines of supporting Vietnam and resisting America, are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and joy, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee. The revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region resolutely declare that they will definitely follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, under the command of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, fully play the leading role of the working class, earnestly carry out the struggles, criticisms, and transformations, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

The heroic people of Guangxi, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are earnestly studying the extremely important latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao:

"To achieve the proletarian education revolution, it must be led by the working class, and the working class must participate, in cooperation with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian education revolution to the end, implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The worker propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time to participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools and forever lead the schools. In the countryside, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools." "Establish revolutionary committees with a three-in-one combination, carry out large-scale criticisms, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, and transfer office personnel. The struggles, criticisms, and transformations in factories generally go through these stages." They are determined to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their guide, advance with victory, launch a high tide of education revolution and struggles, criticisms, and transformations, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The newly born Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee held a full committee (expanded) meeting today. Everyone first earnestly studied the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and the editorials "Follow Chairman Mao's Great Strategic Deployment and Advance" from the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, fully play the leading role of the working class, launch a high tide of struggles, criticisms, and transformations, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Comrade Wei Guoqing, the chairman of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, pointed out in his speech that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the direction for the proletarian education revolution and struggles, criticisms, and transformations, and have extremely great strategic significance for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must earnestly study and resolutely implement them. In the Cultural Revolution and all work, we must firmly rely on the working class and fully play the leading role of the working class. Further consolidate and develop revolutionary committees at all levels, further deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, earnestly do the work of cleaning up the class ranks, rectify the party organization, streamline organizations, grasp revolution and promote production, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary workers, in the days of enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, unanimously declared that they would not disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's expectations, definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, "in the struggle, continuously improve one's political awareness," and with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses, unite around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, actively participate in the great high tide of struggles, criticisms, and transformations, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary workers of Liuzhou Railway Bureau, who have just established the revolutionary committee, in the days of celebrating the birth of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, follow Chairman Mao's great teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness," and are determined to further launch a new high tide of revolution and production, ensure that the steel transportation line in the southern border of the motherland is unobstructed day and night, and make greater contributions to the development of the national industry and agriculture, and to supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression.

The good news spread to the vast countryside, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of various ethnic groups were extremely joyful and excited, spreading the news to each other. The heroic people of various ethnic groups in the old revolutionary base of Youjiang, who have fought bravely against the Guomindang Guisi warlords, declared that they would definitely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle, with the revolutionary spirit of "pursuing the fleeing enemy with remaining courage," do a good job of cleaning up the class ranks, and root out all the remnants of the Guomindang, traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and other counter-revolutionaries, to ensure that the iron mountains and rivers in the southern border of the motherland will never change color. Comrade Su Mingying, a deputy instructor of the militia from the Jiangping Commune of Dongxing County, an autonomous county of various ethnic groups, and a member of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, said excitedly, "We poor and lower-middle peasants will always listen to Chairman Mao's words and follow Chairman Mao. We will make the fishing port of the Jing people a red school of Mao Zedong Thought."

"Early on, the defenses were already strict, and now the will is even stronger." The militia of various ethnic groups in Guangxi, who are day and night guarding the border, coastal, and air defenses of the motherland, in the days of celebrating victory, reviewed the teachings of the great commander Chairman Mao: "We must not, because of victory, relax our vigilance against the crazed revenge plots of the imperialists and their running dogs." They have heightened their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, determined to raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, strengthen the awareness of the enemy, strengthen preparedness, and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate any daring invaders.

"When the military and the people unite as one, who in the world can be our enemy?" The broad masses of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary groups, in the days of celebrating the glorious birth of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangxi in defending the great socialist motherland, defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carrying out the "three supports and two militaries" work. They are determined to raise high the great banner of "supporting the military and loving the people," carry out larger-scale support-the-military activities, and build the southern border of the motherland into an impregnable steel wall.

The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guangxi, who have made great contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are filled with the joy of victory, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious birth of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee. The cadres and soldiers are full of fighting spirit, declaring that they will definitely, together with the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in the region, continue to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, advance with victory, fully play the leading role of the working class, seize the opportunity to earnestly carry out the struggles, criticisms, and transformations, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They must also strengthen preparedness, guard the border, coastal, and air defenses, and be ready at any time to annihilate all daring invaders.

In recent days, the camps of the Guangxi garrison troops are decorated with lanterns and red flags, and the joyous shouts and drumbeats echo everywhere. The broad cadres and soldiers enthusiastically celebrate the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, which is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! Many units also organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into the mountainous areas and villages to report the good news. From the shores of Beibu Gulf to the banks of the Youjiang River, from the northern mountains of Guangxi to the foot of the Friendship Pass, the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" echo everywhere.

The cadres and soldiers of the Guangxi garrison, in the great days of celebrating the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, earnestly studied the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao: "To achieve the proletarian education revolution, it must be led by the working class, and the working class must participate, in cooperation with the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and with the students, teachers, and workers in the school who are determined to carry the proletarian education revolution to the end, implement the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The worker propaganda teams must stay in the schools for a long time to participate in all the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the schools and forever lead the schools. In the countryside, the most reliable allies of the working class—the poor and lower-middle peasants—should manage the schools." "Establish revolutionary committees with a three-in-one combination, carry out large-scale criticisms, clean up the class ranks, rectify the party, streamline organizations, reform unreasonable regulations, and transfer office personnel. The struggles, criticisms, and transformations in factories generally go through these stages." They also studied the important article by Comrade Yao Wenyuan. The cadres and soldiers excitedly said, "Chairman Mao has spoken the words in our hearts. We firmly support and resolutely implement them!" In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in eight days, they achieved three victories and three defeats, consecutively shot down five American aggressor planes that invaded our airspace, and were awarded a collective second-class merit citation. The cadres and soldiers of a certain air force unit in Guangxi said, "Chairman Mao instructs me to implement, and Chairman Mao waves his hand for me to advance. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, rely on the leadership of the working class, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, unify our understanding, steps, and actions with Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely smash the reactionary bourgeoisie's theory of 'multi-center is no center,' and forever be the loyal guardians of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." The military cadres in Nanning, who have been supporting the left for more than two years, reviewed the battle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and highly praised the great achievements created by the working class in the Cultural Revolution. Comrade Ding Qingfu, the deputy political commissar of a certain regiment executing the support-the-left task in the Nanning Railway Bureau, said, "The working class is the most loyal to Chairman Mao and follows Chairman Mao the closest. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has played the great leading role of the leading class. When a small handful of capitalist roaders in the party did everything they could to sabotage the railway transportation from Nanning to Zhanjiang, the railway workers firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, firmly guarded their production posts, and ensured the smooth transportation. Both the revolution and production have achieved great successes."

The broad cadres and soldiers, in the days of celebrating the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, reviewed Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and his instructions on solving the Guangxi issue, and more deeply realized that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Luo Changyuan, an active member of the study of Chairman Mao's works from the Guangzhou Army, who bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and was awarded a first-class merit citation, excitedly said, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Reviewing the battle course of the Cultural Revolution, which step was not personally guided by you, and which victory did not shine with the brilliant light of your great thought! You guided us to overthrow the capitalist roaders in Guangxi, smash the sabotage plots of the class enemies, and establish the new revolutionary committee. In the future, we will definitely follow your teachings, forever rely on the leadership of the working class, unite with the broad masses, and advance with victory along the revolutionary course you have opened!"

The cadres and soldiers of the Guangxi garrison remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forget class struggle," determined to heighten their revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen the awareness of the enemy, rely on the broad masses, resolutely strike down the sabotage and disruption of a small handful of class enemies, determined to further carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism, and do a better job of supporting Vietnam and resisting America. The cadres and soldiers of the air force units stationed in Guangxi and those on the border and coastal defense lines declared that they would definitely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, guard the great motherland, stand good watch, fight good battles. The broad cadres and soldiers also declared that they would firmly support the revolutionary actions of the worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, fully implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, earnestly carry out the struggles, criticisms, and transformations, continuously consolidate and develop the new revolutionary committees, and in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, create new merits for the people.
