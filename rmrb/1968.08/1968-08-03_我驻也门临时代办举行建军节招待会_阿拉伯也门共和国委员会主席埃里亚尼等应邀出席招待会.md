	Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Yemen Holds Reception for Army Day
	Chairman of the Yemen Arab Republic Revolutionary Command Council, Al-Eryani, and Others Attend

	SANAA, July 31 (Xinhua) — The Chinese Charge d'Affaires in Yemen, Zheng Kangping, held a reception on July 31 to celebrate the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	Chairman of the Yemen Arab Republic Revolutionary Command Council, Abdul Rahman Al-Eryani, Vice Premier Abdul Salam Sabra, Deputy Chairman of the Defense Council, Major General Hussein Dafi, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Colonel Salem Razi, Deputy Chief of Staff, Colonel Ali Hurani, and other high-ranking military and political officials and friends totaling more than 100 people were invited to attend the reception.

	In his speech at the reception, Zheng Kangping said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a powerful revolutionary army personally created by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. It is the pillar of our country's proletarian dictatorship and a strong force for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. In China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has firmly defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and made new and great contributions to the people. He also said: "The government, army, and people of Yemen have bravely fought against the armed subversion plots supported by American imperialism and the reactionary forces of Saudi Arabia. They have relied on their own strength to overcome various difficulties and achieved great victories."

	Zheng Kangping also strongly condemned the serious anti-China atrocities committed by the reactionary forces in Yemen, backed by American imperialism, which brazenly shelled the residence of Chinese technical personnel and the textile factory built with Chinese aid in Yemen. He said: "American imperialism's attempt to create shameless atrocities to provoke and destroy Sino-Yemeni friendship is in vain. This will only backfire." He reiterated: "The Chinese government and people, starting from the interests of the peoples of China and Yemen, firmly support the just struggle of the government and people of Yemen to maintain national independence and resist the aggression of American imperialism."

	Chairman Al-Eryani also spoke at the reception. He praised the Chinese engineering and technical personnel participating in the aid and construction in Yemen for persevering in their work alongside the Yemeni people in extremely dangerous times. He said that the Chinese people and government have provided and continue to provide great assistance to Yemen. He expressed his gratitude for this.

	At the reception, some Yemeni friends enthusiastically praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army. One Yemeni friend said: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a powerful force against imperialism." Some Yemeni friends shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Eternal friendship between the peoples of China and Yemen!"

	The reception was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere.
