		Brazilian Students Continue Struggle Against Dictatorship

		Three thousand Uruguayan students clash with police

		Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: Rio de Janeiro reports: Two thousand university students in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on the 7th, broke through the layers of defense set up by the reactionary military police, holding anti-dictatorship demonstrations and flash mob gatherings. They protested against the brutal suppression of the student movement by the pro-American military dictatorship and demanded the release of a student leader who was arbitrarily arrested by the authorities three days prior.

		The demonstrating students held up banners opposing the dictatorship, marching through several main streets in the city center for forty-five minutes. They also pasted banners condemning the dictatorship on public buses.

		Previously, university students in Rio de Janeiro, defying the authorities' ban, had already held protests and gatherings on the 4th and 5th.

		The pro-American dictatorship in Brazil is extremely fearful of the continuing development of the student movement. On the 6th, they mobilized a large number of army, navy, and air force troops to enter Rio de Janeiro for defense. Major locations in the city were guarded by the military, and military patrols were deployed throughout the city, giving the city the appearance of being in a state of war. To prevent student demonstrations, the reactionary military police arrested several hundred students.

		Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: Rio de Janeiro reports: Students in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, under the strict control of the reactionary military police in the city, held another demonstration on the 9th. They protested against the suppression of the student movement by the military dictatorship and demanded the release of a student leader who was recently arrested. The demonstration marched through the main streets of the city center, despite the suppression by the military police.

		On the 8th, a student demonstration against the military dictatorship also erupted in Salvador, the capital of Bahia State. Over two thousand students in Salvador engaged in fierce battles with armed police, using stones. They overturned cars to build barricades, bravely counterattacking the police's assaults.

		Xinhua News Agency, August 10th: Montevideo reports: Three thousand university students in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, held a fierce demonstration on the 9th. They protested against the government's violation of university autonomy and illegal searches of the campus, engaging in several hours of fierce battles with the police.

		Early on the 9th, Uruguayan police raided the University of the Republic of Uruguay, conducting illegal searches and mass arrests. This blatant violation of university autonomy enraged the students. Approximately three thousand students took to the streets, holding protest demonstrations. They engaged in fierce battles with the police in an eight-block area near the university. Demonstrating students retaliated with large stones against the mounted police charging at them. Some students threw stones from the rooftops of campus buildings, knocking some mounted police off their horses. Others jumped onto a public bus, driving at full speed towards a group of about fifty mounted police, forcing the police to scatter in panic.

		Reports indicate that one student was killed and dozens injured in the clashes. A large number of students were arbitrarily arrested.

　　巴西学生继续开展反独裁统治斗争
　　乌拉圭三千名示威学生同警察搏斗
    新华社九日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西里约热内卢的两千名大学生七日冲破了反动军警的层层设防，举行反独裁示威游行和闪电集会，抗议亲美军事独裁政权残暴地镇压学生运动，要求释放三日被当局无理逮捕的一位大学生领导人。
    示威学生高举反对独裁政权的标语，在市中心的几条大街上游行了四十五分钟，他们还在公共汽车上贴上了谴责独裁当局的标语。
    在这以前，里约热内卢的大学生不顾当局禁令，已经在四日和五日连续举行过抗议示威和集会。
    巴西亲美独裁当局对学生运动的继续发展怕得要命，六日竟调动大批陆海空军部队进入里约热内卢布防，城内各主要地点都有军队驻守，军事巡逻队在全城各处巡逻，城市呈现出处于战争状态的景象。为了防止学生示威，反动军警逮捕了好几百名学生。
    据新华社十日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西里约热内卢的学生，在反动军警严密控制这个城市的情况下，九日再次举行了示威游行，抗议巴西军事独裁当局镇压学生运动，要求释放不久前被捕的一名学生领导人。示威队伍不顾军警的镇压，通过了市中心的主要街道。
    八日，在巴伊亚州首府萨尔瓦多市也爆发了学生反对军事独裁当局的示威游行。萨尔瓦多市的两千多名学生用石块同武装警察进行了激烈的搏斗。他们用翻倒的汽车筑起街垒，英勇地反击警察对他们的袭击。
    新华社十日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭首都蒙得维的亚三千名大学生九日举行激烈的示威，抗议政府破坏大学自治、非法搜查校园的暴行，他们同警察部队进行了好几个小时的英勇搏斗。
    乌拉圭警察九日凌晨闯进乌拉圭国立自治大学，非法进行大搜查和大逮捕。这种公开破坏大学自治的行为激起了学生们的强烈愤怒。大约有三千名学生冲上街头，举行抗议示威，他们在大学校园附近的八条街段的地区里同警察发生激烈的搏斗。示威学生用大石块还击冲向他们的骑警。有些学生从校园楼房屋顶上向警察扔石块，把一些骑警打得跌下马来。还有人跳上一辆公共汽车，开足马力向一支约五十人的骑警队冲去，迫使这些警察慌忙散开。
    据报道，在搏斗中有一名学生被杀害，好几十人受伤。大批学生被无理逮捕。（附图片）
