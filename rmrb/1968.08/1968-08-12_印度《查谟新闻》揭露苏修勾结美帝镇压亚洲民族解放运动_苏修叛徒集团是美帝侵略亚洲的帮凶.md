	Indian progressive weekly "Kashmir News" recently published an article exposing the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's efforts to spread revisionist fallacies in Asia, collude with some reactionary regimes, and assist U.S. imperialism in forming an anti-China alliance, acting as a henchman for U.S. imperialism's suppression of Asian national liberation movements.

	The article points out that while the Soviet revisionists sign non-proliferation treaties and other agreements with imperialists, they carve up spheres of influence with U.S. imperialism. On the other hand, they peddle "peaceful coexistence" and other junk, attempting to blunt the edge of the liberation movement. The article exposes the Soviet revisionists' efforts to advocate that the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries should not use violence to resist violent oppression, aiming to confine their struggles within the scope of "peaceful" methods and parliamentary elections.

	The article points out that U.S. imperialism has formed alliances with some Asian countries to oppose China, and the Soviet revisionists have taken the lead in developing relations with these anti-China regimes. The article cites facts to point out: After the Indonesian fascist military clique, following the CIA's plot, carried out a massacre of Indonesian communists and the Indonesian people and seized power, the Soviet revisionists provided various forms of "aid" to this regime; the Soviet revisionists also strengthened relations with the Japanese reactionary government and "Malaysia"; when the guerrilla fighters led by the Communist Party of Burma fought the Ne Win government to the point of panic, the Soviet revisionists came out to support Ne Win.

	The article exposes that in January of this year, when Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visited the Soviet Union, she clearly stated to the Soviet revisionist leaders that after the British troops withdrew from Southeast Asia, Soviet "aid" would be particularly welcome. The Soviet revisionists also assured her that they were happy to fill the vacuum left by Britain's withdrawal from the region. The article points out that Indira Gandhi recently, according to the wishes of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists, traveled to Australia, New Zealand, "Malaysia," and other places, with the aim of extinguishing the revolutionary movements of the people in Southeast Asia.

	The article points out that the "non-aligned" fraud of the Indian and Burmese governments has been exposed, and their dependence on U.S. imperialism and its allies has greatly increased. Thus, imperialism has tied them together to form an anti-communist front. Under the current circumstances, this anti-communist front has proven to be a more effective tool for serving imperialism than the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The Soviet revisionists do not formally join this anti-communist front, but they provide ample aid to countries eager to join the front, thus contributing their own efforts to the imperialist conspiracy in Southeast Asia.

	The article emphasizes that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to suppress Asian national liberation movements will not succeed. The people of many Asian countries have risen up to wage armed struggles. People's wars have shown great power, defeating imperialists armed with modern weapons. People's wars have made U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists tremble with fear.

　　印度《查谟新闻》揭露苏修勾结美帝镇压亚洲民族解放运动
　　苏修叛徒集团是美帝侵略亚洲的帮凶
    新华社十日讯　新德里消息：印度进步周刊《查谟新闻》最近发表文章，揭露苏修叛徒集团在亚洲极力散布修正主义谬论，同一些反动的政权勾结，帮助美帝拼凑反华联盟，充当美帝国主义镇压亚洲民族解放运动的帮凶。
    文章指出，苏修一方面同帝国主义者缔结防止核扩散条约和其它协定，同美帝国主义一起划分势力范围；另一方面兜售“和平共处”之类的破烂货，妄图挫钝解放运动的锋芒。文章揭露苏修极力鼓吹殖民地、半殖民地国家的人民不要采取暴力来反对暴力压迫，企图使他们的斗争局限在“和平方式”和议会选举的范围中。
    文章指出，美帝国主义同一些亚洲国家结成联盟来反对中国，苏修也出面同这些反华的政权发展关系。文章列举事实，指出：印度尼西亚法西斯军人集团，按照美国中央情报局的阴谋计划，对印尼共产党人和印尼人民进行大屠杀以后，夺取了政权，苏修就用各种办法向这个政权提供“援助”；苏修还同日本反动政府和“马来西亚”加强了关系；当缅甸共产党领导的游击战士把缅甸奈温政府打得失魂落魄的时候，苏修又出来对奈温表示支持。
    文章揭露，在今年一月间，印度总理英迪拉·甘地访问苏联时，向苏修领导人明白地表示，在英军撤出东南亚以后，苏联的“援助”特别受欢迎。苏修也向她保证，他们很高兴填补英国撤出这个地区后造成的真空。文章指出，英迪拉·甘地最近按照美帝和苏修的意旨，到澳大利亚、新西兰、“马来西亚”等地活动，其目的在于扑灭东南亚人民的革命运动。
    文章指出，印度、缅甸政府的“不结盟”骗局已经被揭穿，它们对美帝国主义及其盟国的依赖大大加强了。这样帝国主义就把它们拴在一起，组成一个反共阵线。在目前情况下，这个反共阵线已证明是比东南亚条约组织更有效地替帝国主义效劳的工具。苏联修正主义者表面上不参加这个反共阵线，但是，他们向渴望加入这个阵线的国家提供充分的援助，从而为实现帝国主义在东南亚的阴谋尽了自己的力量。
    文章强调指出，美帝苏修镇压亚洲民族解放运动的阴谋不会得逞。亚洲许多国家的人民已经起来开展武装斗争。人民战争显示了极大的威力，打败了用现代化武器武装起来的帝国主义者。人民战争使美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者胆战心惊。
