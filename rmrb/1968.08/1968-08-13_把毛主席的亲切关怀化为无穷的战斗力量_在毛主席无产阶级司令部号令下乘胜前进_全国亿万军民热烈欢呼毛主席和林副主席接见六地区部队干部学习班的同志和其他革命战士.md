The joyous news that our most beloved and great leader, great helmsman Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on August 11 warmly received comrades from the six regions' PLA ground, naval, and air force cadre classes for studying Mao Zedong Thought and other revolutionary fighters, has surged through our motherland, inspiring the hearts of hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians, and bringing immense encouragement and boundless fighting strength to the nationwide proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary groups, and PLA combatants who are striving for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the midst of the nationwide celebration of the second anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's big-character poster "Bombard the Headquarters," the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the communiqu√© of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and on the joyous day when Chairman Mao presented precious gifts to the capital's workers, peasants, and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, the warm reception by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin has great significance. It is the greatest care, encouragement, and support for the soldiers and civilians nationwide. Hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to temper their boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, to unite more closely around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, to resolutely criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory," to timely expose and thoroughly smash the plots of a handful of class enemies attempting to sabotage the proletarian headquarters, to unify wills, steps, and actions under the command of the proletarian headquarters, to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and to resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Chairman Mao is always heart-to-heart with the revolutionary masses, and hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians will always follow Chairman Mao in revolution.

From last night to today, the joyous news has spread throughout the country. On the vast sea defenses, border lines, camps, airports, factories, mines, communes, shops, offices, and schools, millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary masses everywhere are expressing their loyalty to the great teacher Chairman Mao and pledging their determination. "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!" The joyous shouts praising the great leader Chairman Mao and the revolutionary songs resonate across the vast land of our motherland. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians are celebrating as if it were a grand festival, carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao, beating drums and gongs, singing and dancing, surging towards squares and streets, enthusiastically cheering for the great leader Chairman Mao's great care, and enthusiastically cheering for Chairman Mao being always heart-to-heart with the revolutionary masses. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians in Fuzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, Kunming, Urumqi, and Lhasa held grand celebrations or parades last night, singing "The Sailors March to the Beat of the Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Dear, But Chairman Mao Is Dearer" over and over again, immersed in boundless joy and happiness. Many PLA combatants and revolutionary masses, in front of the portraits of Chairman Mao they have embroidered, solemnly pledged: Always follow the great leader Chairman Mao in revolution.

The cadres and fighters of the General Logistics Department of the PLA, an advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works, and the Kaqila Logistics Station, known as the "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Station on the Snowy Mountains" by the Tibetan people, said with great excitement: "The brightest star in the morning is the morning star, and the closest relative is the great leader Chairman Mao. We highland fighters have only the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin in our hearts, and our steps will always follow Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." The cadres and fighters of a certain "Four Good" observation and communication station of the North Sea Fleet, fighting on the frontline of the Yellow Sea, held a loyalty pledge meeting to Chairman Mao in front of a "Tiananmen" made of pines and cypresses cultivated with soil from Tiananmen Square in Beijing. They said: "Standing on the island looking at Beijing, a red sun rises in the heart, the sailors' hearts are with Chairman Mao, and the vast sea defenses will be forged into the Great Wall." The soldiers guarding the southern gate of the motherland wrote in their loyalty book to Chairman Mao: "Hundreds of sunflowers bloom towards the sun, and all rivers flow into the sea; the soldiers are loyal to Chairman Mao, and their loyalty will never change even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble!"

Consciously, swiftly, and thoroughly carry out all orders of the proletarian headquarters, resolutely criticize the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory"

The joyous news of the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao warmly receiving more than twenty thousand revolutionary fighters has further inspired the deep proletarian feelings of hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians nationwide towards the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. They said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the core of the entire Chinese people. Without this core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." The proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is the sole leadership center for the entire Party, the entire army, the entire nation, and the broad revolutionary masses. The attitude towards the proletarian headquarters is a fundamental issue of stance, an issue of standing on which side in the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and an issue of whether to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must, with high organizational discipline, swiftly and thoroughly carry out every instruction of Chairman Mao and every battle order of the proletarian headquarters, thoroughly smash the reactionary "multi-center theory," and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad cadres and fighters of the model Red Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region, the Hard-Boned Sixth Company of the Wuhan Military Region, the model platoon for supporting the left and loving the people, the former unit of the model hero Yang Rensheng, the former unit of Qiu Shaoyun, the former platoon of the model for loving the people Xie Chen, the former unit of Liu Yingjun, and the certain anti-aircraft artillery Third Company, which has been rated as a "Four Good" company for seven consecutive years, as well as the active learners and practitioners of Mao Zedong Thought such as Feng Fugeng and the model soldier Wang Yuchang, spoke out the hearts of the soldiers and civilians nationwide when they cheered for the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception. They pointed out that closely uniting around the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, taking the will of this center as our will, the steps of this center as our steps, and the actions of this center as our actions, we will be invincible and victorious wherever we go; without this center, we will lose our soul and direction. They said, we will follow the proletarian headquarters of Chairman Mao for sure! Whoever dares to sabotage the proletarian headquarters, we will fight them to the end and struggle to the end!

The broad revolutionary workers of Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, Shanghai Pioneer Electric Motor Factory, Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, Shenyang Factory 5705, Wuhan No. 3 Cotton Mill, Nanjing Chemical Fertilizer Factory, Hangzhou Railway Bureau, Harbin New Wind Processing Factory, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Guangzhou Maritime and Electric Power Systems, while enthusiastically cheering for Chairman Mao's reception, enthusiastically praised the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters and severely criticized the reactionary "multi-center theory." The broad revolutionary workers of Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory said excitedly that the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. It is the sole leadership center that has been tested in long-term revolutionary struggles. This center is the greatest, the wisest, and the most correct. Our entire Party, army, and nation have only this one center and cannot have a second center. A handful of class enemies spread the reactionary "multi-center theory," attempting to shake the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and disrupt Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We, the working class, are determined to wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and smash the reactionary bourgeois "multi-center theory" to smithereens. The revolutionary workers of some industries in Guangzhou, while thoroughly criticizing the reactionary "multi-center theory," are launching a high tide of leveling the hills, achieving and consolidating revolutionary great alliances according to systems, industries, and classes.

Chen Yonggui, deputy director of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and party branch secretary of Dazhai Brigade, and Zhang Fugui, a national agricultural labor model and responsible person of the preparatory committee of the poor and lower-middle peasants' representative congress of Shandong Province, expressed the deep proletarian feelings of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants nationwide towards the proletarian headquarters. Chen Yonggui said, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin most concentratedly represents the fundamental interests of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We have limitless love and loyalty towards the proletarian headquarters. The bourgeois headquarters led by China's Khrushchev represents the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We have boundless hatred for them and will resolutely smash them. Zhang Fugui said, we poor and lower-middle peasants most support the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin and most admire this leadership center. Whoever creates a second center, we will struggle with them to the end!

Take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions

"The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians emphasized when cheering for the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception that one of the great historical achievements of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee held two years ago was the establishment of Vice Chairman Lin as the deputy helmsman of the entire Party, further consolidating the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Vice Chairman Lin is the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, holds the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought highest, and most resolutely and thoroughly executes and defends Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He is the shining example of the entire Party, army, and nation in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. The most fundamental thing is to take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, carry forward the revolutionary academic style advocated by Chairman Mao of combining theory with practice, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, especially learn and apply Chairman Mao's series of extremely important latest instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. For every instruction of Chairman Mao and every order of the proletarian headquarters, we must resolutely carry them out and thoroughly implement them. We must carry them out whether we understand them or not, and deepen our understanding in the process of implementation. This is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the highest level of awareness and the most fundamental revolutionary principle for every revolutionary fighter.

The revolutionary workers of Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory and Guizhou Yongsheng Electric Meter Factory, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Huangshandong Brigade in Guangdong Province and Shashiyu Brigade in Hebei Province, deeply felt from the struggles of the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is victory! To follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, we must guide our actions with Mao Zedong Thought. They said, whether we seriously study and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and all the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin is not a simple matter of academic style, but a fundamental attitude towards our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian headquarters. We must resolutely resist and oppose the hypocritical and insincere two-faced bad style.

The cadres and fighters of a certain regiment's Fifth Company, who were collectively awarded the second-class merit for protecting revolutionary masses in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait last night and excitedly expressed: We must further master the great Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, turning Chairman Mao's instructions into the conscious revolutionary actions of the broad revolutionary masses. The cadres and fighters of the "Sea Tigers" and "Red Spearhead Company" on the frontline of Fujian, and the cadres and fighters of the "Luoyang Heroes Company" of the Kunming Military Region, which has been rated as a "Four Good" company for many consecutive years, deeply felt from long-term revolutionary struggles and the past two years of the Cultural Revolution that the great Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the entire Party, army, and nation. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought, we have the correct direction and boundless power, and we can move from victory to victory. They said, we must resolutely follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, seriously implement Vice Chairman Lin's principles and policies on political construction of the army, firmly walk the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, criticize and rectify oneself, and quickly raise the awareness of class struggle and line struggle, accelerate ideological revolutionization, and in the great storms of class struggle, temper ourselves into proletarian vanguard fighters who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The soldiers and civilians of various places also unanimously expressed that they must further thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, earnestly carry out all the battle orders of the proletarian headquarters, further strengthen proletarian dictatorship, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, accurately and firmly strike a handful of class enemies, do a good job in cleaning up class ranks, streamlining the bureaucracy, and other tasks, eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation on all fronts, better grasp revolution and promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! The broad proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary groups, and PLA "three supports, two militaries" personnel in Fujian, Yunnan, Guangxi, Xinjiang, and Tibet all enthusiastically expressed that they must, with faster steps, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, quickly achieve revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-ones, establish revolutionary committees, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Higher up the banner of "support the army, love the people" and "support the government, love the people," further consolidate the great iron wall, and soldiers and civilians jointly achieve a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution

When the nationwide hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians are enthusiastically celebrating the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception of military cadres and other revolutionary fighters, they all expressed their determination to higher up the great banner of "support the army, love the people" and "support the government, love the people," under the wise leadership of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, further strengthen military-civilian unity, consolidate the great iron wall, and fight shoulder to shoulder for a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary masses of the Jinggangshan region, who have forged deep revolutionary friendship with the PLA in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, held grand celebration meetings when the joyous news of Chairman Mao's reception arrived. The responsible person of the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Committee said at the meeting, the children of Jinggangshan with glorious revolutionary traditions best understand Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Without a people's army, there will be nothing for the people." The great People's Liberation Army is the strong pillar of proletarian dictatorship and has made indelible great merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We, the children of Jinggangshan, will forever remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "support the army, love the people," forever unite closely with the PLA, fight together, and win together, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The revolutionary workers of Changsha City and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade in Shanxi Province expressed their determination to further respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "support the army, love the people," thoroughly smash the plots of a handful of class enemies attempting to sabotage military-civilian unity, love the PLA more, believe in and rely on the PLA more, cherish the PLA as they cherish their own eyes, and defend the great iron wall. Many regions' revolutionary Red Guards said, we must follow Chairman Mao's great instructions, "learn politics, military affairs, the four firsts, the three-eighths style, the three major disciplines and eight items of attention from the PLA, and strengthen organizational discipline." We must be models of supporting the army and learning from the army.

Many representatives attending the Second "Four Good" Company Representatives Conference of the Navy and the Second Conference of Active Learners and Practitioners of Mao Zedong Thought in the Beijing Region expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "not living on past merits but creating new ones," earnestly carry forward the Party's fine tradition of closely linking with the masses, and together with the broad revolutionary masses build good new revolutionary committees and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The comrades of the former unit of Cai Yongxiang said, we must turn Chairman Mao's warm care into great strength, take the communist fighter Cai Yongxiang as an example, and dedicate all our strength to protecting the broad masses of people. The broad cadres and fighters of the Xinjiang Military Region, when cheering for Chairman Mao's warm reception, excitedly expressed: We must further implement Chairman Mao's great instructions of "support the army, love the people," carry forward the style of being modest, prudent, and closely linked with the masses, maintain the flesh-and-blood connection with the people, strengthen military-civilian unity and national unity, and together with the revolutionary people of Xinjiang, achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and build the great northwestern frontier of our motherland into an iron wall against imperialism and revisionism.
