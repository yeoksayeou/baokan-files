Johannesburg students raise "Down with Fascism" banners to protest against racist authorities

	South African students' just struggle against racial discrimination, which began on August 14 at the University of Cape Town, continues to develop vigorously in several important cities in South Africa. Thousands of students in these cities are engaged in a tenacious and courageous struggle against the South African racist authorities.

	On the seventh day of their sit-in protest against the South African authorities' ban on the appointment of African scholar Mafeye as a lecturer at the University of Cape Town, students decided to continue their struggle. Their just cause has received enthusiastic support from students at other universities in South Africa.

	On August 19, students at the University of the Witwatersrand in another major South African city, Johannesburg, prepared to march through the city center to hold a protest demonstration, but were brutally obstructed by the authorities. The protesting students immediately sent a delegation to Pretoria (the South African capital) to lodge a strong protest with the South African fascist leader Vorster, severely condemning the despicable actions of the racist authorities. At the same time, more than 200 students, holding banners with slogans such as "Down with Fascism," sang "We Shall Overcome" and lined up on both sides of a main street outside the University of the Witwatersrand campus to hold a protest demonstration against the racist authorities.

	Following this, more than 2,000 students in Johannesburg held a rally on August 20. A representative of the University of the Witwatersrand students exposed the reactionary authorities' refusal to accept students' protest letters and other actions. These students then signed a statement expressing their support for the just struggle of the University of Cape Town students.

	Since August 19, students in two other important cities in South Africa, Durban and Pietermaritzburg, have also held mass rallies to protest against the South African authorities' policy of racial discrimination and the suppression of protesting students.

	The South African fascist leader Vorster, facing the surging tide of student struggle, attempted to disrupt it using a combination of soft and hard tactics. On the one hand, he threatened the students, saying that if the "disturbances" did not subside, he would take personal action; on the other hand, he hypocritically promised to "meet with students holding different opinions within ten days," attempting to lull the students and disperse their resolve.

	However, a spokesman for the University of the Witwatersrand Student Council and student representatives took a firm stance on this. They said: "If he (Vorster) thinks that such threats can hinder students from supporting the right cause, then he has greatly underestimated the students." They stated that the protest against the ban on the appointment of Mafeye was "just the beginning."

	This struggle by South African students against racial discrimination has shocked the bourgeois opinion in the West. The British Daily Telegraph reported on August 21 in an article titled "The Fire of Protest in South Africa": "The students in Cape Town have ignited a small fire, which may spark a nationwide bushfire."

    南非学生反对种族歧视斗争蓬勃发展
    约翰内斯堡大学生高举“打倒法西斯”旗帜向种族主义当局举行抗议示威
    新华社二十二日讯　开普敦消息：南非大学生十四日掀起的反对种族歧视的正义斗争，继续在南非几个重要城市蓬勃发展。这些城市的几千名学生正在同南非种族主义当局进行英勇顽强的斗争。
    开普敦大学学生在他们为抗议南非当局禁止任命非洲人马费耶为该校讲师而举行的静坐示威进入第七天时，决定把这一斗争继续坚持下去。他们的正义斗争得到南非其它大学学生的热烈支持。
    十九日，南非另一大城市约翰内斯堡的韦特瓦特斯兰德大学学生准备穿过闹市举行抗议示威，但遭到当局蛮横阻拦，示威学生便派出代表团立即赶到比勒陀利亚（南非首府）向南非法西斯头目沃斯特提出强烈抗议，严厉谴责种族主义当局的卑劣行径；同时，二百多名学生高举写有“打倒法西斯”等口号的旗帜，唱着《我们将胜利》的歌曲，排列在韦特瓦特斯兰德校园外面的一条主要街道的两边，向种族主义当局举行抗议示威。
    接着，约翰内斯堡的两千多名学生在二十日举行集会，韦特瓦特斯兰德大学学生负责人在会上揭露反动当局拒绝接受学生抗议信等行径后，这些学生纷纷签名表示支援开普敦大学学生的正义斗争。
    从十九日以来，在南非的另外两个重要城市德班和彼得马里茨堡的学生们都举行了群众集会，抗议南非当局奉行种族歧视的政策和镇压示威学生。
    色厉内荏的南非法西斯头目沃斯特，面临日益高涨的学生斗争浪潮，企图用软硬兼施的办法来进行破坏，他一面对学生威胁说，如果这次“骚乱”不平息，他将亲自采取行动；一面又假惺惺地答应“在十天内会见持有不同意见的学生”，妄图麻痹学生，涣散他们的斗志。
    但是，韦特瓦特斯兰德大学学生委员会的发言人和学生负责人对此表示了严正的态度。他们说：“如果他（沃斯特）以为这种威胁就可以阻碍学生支持正确的事情的话，那么，他就大大低估了学生。”他们表示，对禁止任命马费耶一事的抗议“仅仅是开始”。
    这次南非学生反对种族歧视的斗争烈火，使西方资产阶级的舆论感到震惊。英国《每日电讯报》二十一日在一篇题为《南非的抗议之火》的报道中惊呼：“开普敦的学生已经点燃了一团小火，它可能引起蔓延全国的一场灌木林式的大火。”
