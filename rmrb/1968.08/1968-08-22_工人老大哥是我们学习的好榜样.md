To the Editor:

The workers' Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from the Beijing Knitting Factory came to our brigade to enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought and actively support agriculture. They stayed with us for a few months, and their help was immense. During these months of interaction, we saw from them that the working class is most loyal to Chairman Mao, most closely follows Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and best practices Mao Zedong Thought. They are our poor and lower-middle peasants' good examples to learn from.

The workers from the Knitting Factory, upon arriving at our brigade, first enthusiastically propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They worked through the night to print Chairman Mao's latest instructions and delivered them to every household. They also went into the households to help establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The worker comrades studied, fought, labored, and lived with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Together, they recalled bitterness and sweetness, carried out revolutionary criticism, and fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism. They established deep proletarian feelings with us, the poor and lower-middle peasants. Whether in struggle or in life, they always practiced Mao Zedong Thought, learning and applying it immediately, bringing us a good revolutionary learning style.

They also, despite fatigue and adverse weather, volunteered to help our brigade and other brigades repair a large number of agricultural machinery, providing strong support for agricultural production. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants were deeply moved.

We must seriously carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolve to better learn from the working class, strengthen the alliance between workers and peasants, and unite with the working class, fight with them, and achieve victory with them. We will carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

All poor and lower-middle peasants of Yongshun Brigade, Chengguan Commune, Tong County, Beijing

    工人老大哥是我们学习的好榜样编辑同志：
    北京针织总厂的工人毛泽东思想宣传队到我们大队来热情宣传毛泽东思想，积极支援农业，和我们相处了几个月，对我们帮助很大。在这几个月的接触中，从他们身上，我们看到：工人阶级对毛主席最忠，跟毛主席的革命路线最紧，活学活用毛泽东思想最好，是我们贫下中农学习的好榜样。
    针织总厂的工人同志来到我们大队，第一件事就是热情宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示。他们连夜翻印毛主席的最新指示，送到每个社员家里。他们还深入社员家庭，帮助办好家庭毛泽东思想学习班。工人同志们和贫下中农同学习、同战斗、同劳动、同生活，一起忆苦思甜，一起开展革命大批判，一起斗私批修，和我们贫下中农建立了深厚的无产阶级感情。不管是在斗争中还是在生活中，他们处处活学活用毛泽东思想，学了就用，给我们带来了革命的好学风。
    他们还不顾疲劳，不避风雨，抽出人来帮助我们大队和其他大队检修了大批农业机具，有力地支援了农业生产。广大贫下中农深受感动。
    我们一定要认真贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，决心更好地向工人阶级学习，加强工农联盟，和工人阶级团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
