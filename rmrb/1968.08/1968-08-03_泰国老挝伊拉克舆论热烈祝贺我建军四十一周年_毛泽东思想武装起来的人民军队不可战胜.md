The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station, the Pathet Lao radio station, and Iraqi newspapers all published commentaries on August 1, warmly celebrating the 41st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally founded and led by Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people.

The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on August 1. The article stated that the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, is an invincible new type of people's army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has made great contributions to the great victories of the Chinese people's revolution.

The article stated that the victories achieved by the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the great revolutionary struggle have powerfully proven Chairman Mao's wise judgments: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." "Without an army of the people, there can be no people's everything."

The article stated that the Chinese People's Liberation Army was able to grow from small to large, becoming an invincible people's army, because this army was established according to the military thought of Chairman Mao and is under the direct leadership of the Communist Party of China. This army is a new type of people's army that serves the people wholeheartedly.

The article emphasized that the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and the development and strength of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are the glorious victories of Mao Zedong Thought, the glorious victories of people's war, and the glorious victories of Chairman Mao's military thought.

The article stated that on the 41st anniversary of the founding of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, the armed forces and people of Thailand, led by the Communist Party of Thailand, express their heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which enjoys high prestige and has achieved great victories under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. They wish the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which possesses a high spirit of proletarian internationalism, and the Chinese people even greater victories.

The article concluded by expressing that the armed forces and people of Thailand are determined to learn from the glorious example of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, learn from the precious experience of the Chinese people's revolution, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen armed struggle, unite with the great Chinese people, fight shoulder to shoulder, resist the common enemy, and achieve final victory.

The Pathet Lao radio station broadcasted an editorial on August 1. The editorial stated that under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has grown and strengthened in all aspects over the past 41 years and has become a powerful modern army today.

The editorial pointed out that the victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have shown the thorough revolutionary spirit and the lofty internationalist spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a strong pillar for defending the motherland and building socialism.

The editorial stated that the glorious victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have set a brilliant example for the liberation struggle of the world's peoples, especially powerfully inspiring the struggle of the Lao People's Liberation Army and the Lao people against American imperialism. The glorious victories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are a heavy blow to the war conspiracies of American imperialism and its lackeys.

The editorial pointed out that the people of Laos and China have a common enemy—American imperialism and its lackeys. The solidarity between our two countries' people's armies is becoming closer, and friendship is developing.

The editorial stated that the soldiers and commanders of the Lao People's Liberation Army are happy and full of confidence to have the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a close comrade-in-arms.

The editorial warmly wished the Chinese People's Liberation Army to become even stronger, achieving greater victories in socialist construction, in countering American imperialist military provocations, and in the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

The Iraqi newspaper "Baghdad Observer" published an article on August 1. The article reviewed the glorious struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. The article stated that since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, "China has made leaps and bounds in all aspects, China has become the main stronghold against imperialism and reactionaries, a strong backbone of the liberation movements of the whole world."

The article quoted Chairman Mao's teachings: "The enemy will not disappear on its own. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not retreat from the stage of history on their own."

The article stated: "We have gained valuable lessons from China's liberation war, these lessons show that victory always belongs to the people, the people's army is the creator of miracles, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is such an army, they liberated 700 million Chinese people from the shackles of reactionaries, feudalism, and imperialism."

The article in "Friendship News" stated that under the wise leadership of its commander-in-chief Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has conducted a glorious and heroic struggle, showing unprecedented courage and ability in overcoming difficulties, liberating its homeland from dependence, backwardness, corruption, and chaos, making China occupy its due position in the world, and advancing confidently along the path of prosperity in all aspects.
