After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directive was issued, the broad revolutionary masses were overjoyed and enthusiastic, and they flocked to the streets to eagerly propagate Chairman Mao's latest directive. Big-character posters and large slogans filled the entire city of Beijing.

It was already midnight, near Tiananmen Square on the west side, where a group of workers and Red Guards were together writing large slogans to celebrate Chairman Mao's latest directive. What was going on?

It turned out that after the night shift at the Beijing Special Steel Plant ended, the workers immediately organized a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and headed to the streets to post large slogans, enthusiastically celebrating the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive. They divided into two groups: one group in front was responsible for pasting the slogan paper, and the other group in the back was responsible for writing the slogans. When they reached Xinhuamen, because there were too many teams reporting the good news, the comrades writing the slogans took a wrong turn and couldn't find the people pasting the slogan paper. The comrades pasting the paper were also anxious, seeing that the pasted slogan paper had no one to write on it.

Just then, the Red Guards from Beijing No. 77 Middle School arrived to post large slogans. They saw that the large slogans on the wall had no one writing on them, so they asked the workers, "What's going on? Do you have any difficulties?" The workers told them, "The comrades writing the slogans are behind, but we can't find them right now." A few Red Guards said, "We'll help you write them!" They picked up the brushes and helped the workers write the slogan "Heartily celebrate the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive." After finishing, the workers said, "These are written by you, so you should sign your names." The Red Guards said, "These are pasted by you, so you should sign your names." They pushed back and forth, and then one of the Red Guards said, "We are determined to walk the path of unity with workers and peasants, and to fight and win together with the working class forever. Let's sign jointly!" Finally, they wrote the names of Beijing Special Steel Plant and Beijing No. 77 Middle School together.

The workers thanked these Red Guards. They said, "We want to learn from the working class!" They wrote another large slogan next to this one, "Learn from the working class, earnestly carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform." They were so close that passersby thought they were from the same unit.

    街头写标语
    伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示发表以后，广大革命群众欢欣鼓舞，纷纷走向街头，热情宣传毛主席最新指示。大字报、大标语，布满整个北京城。
    已经半夜了，在天安门西边不远的地方，有一群工人和红卫兵小将在一起写欢呼毛主席最新指示的大标语。究竟是怎么回事呢？
    原来，北京特殊钢厂的中班工人下班以后，立即组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，走向街头，贴大标语，热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示的发表。他们分成两部分，一部分在前边负责贴标语纸，一部分在后边写标语。到了新华门时，因为报喜的队伍太多，写标语的同志岔了路，找不到贴标语纸的人了。贴标语纸的同志，这时更是焦急，眼看贴好了的标语纸没有人写。
    正在这时，北京七十七中的红卫兵小将，来到这里贴大标语。他们看到墙上的大标语纸没人写字，就问工人：“怎么啦？有什么困难吗？”工人对他们说：“写标语的同志在后边，现在一时找不到了。”几位红卫兵小将说：“我们来帮助你们写吧！”他们拿起笔就帮助工人写出了“热烈欢呼毛主席最新指示发表”的标语。写完以后，工人说：“这是你们写的，应该署上你们的名字。”红卫兵小将说：“是你们贴的，应署上你们的名字。”互相推来推去，这时有一位红卫兵小将说：“我们决心走同工农相结合的道路，同工人阶级永远战斗在一起，胜利在一起。还是让我们联合署名吧！”最后，他们终于写上北京特殊钢厂和北京七十七中两个单位的名字。
    工人向这几位红卫兵小将致谢。他们说：“我们要向工人阶级学习！”他们在这条标语旁边，又写上了“向工人阶级学习，认真搞好斗、批、改”的大标语。他们这样亲热，过路的人都以为他们是一个单位的。
