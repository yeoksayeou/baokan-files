According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana, the Albanian State Planning Commission's Statistics Bureau issued a statement on July 24 indicating that the Albanian people have completed the national plan for the first half of this year better than ever before.

The statement said that under the guidance of the great ideas of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, the Albanian working class, cooperative farmers, and all working people, with ever-increasing revolutionary enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit, have been working to fulfill the tasks set by the Third and Fourth Plenums of the Party for 1968. Comrade Enver Hoxha's speech in Peshkopi in December 1967 and his speech in April this year on "Worker Supervision" have raised labor enthusiasm to a new level.

The statement said that in the first half of this year, Albania's total industrial output plan was completed at 105%, an increase of 21% over the same period last year. Among these, oil increased by 18%, coal by 12%, chromium by 15%, copper by 64%, electricity by 18%, machinery by 19%, chemicals by 97%, building materials by 37%, timber and paper by 19%, light industry by 22%, and food by 19%.

The statement said that geologists have also successfully completed the plan for the first half of this year. The oil exploration drilling plan was completed at 112%, and the production drilling plan was completed at 103%.

In discussing the achievements in transportation, the statement said that in the first half of this year, the volume of highway freight (in tons) increased by 15% over the same period last year, the volume of railway freight (in tons) increased by 12%, and the volume of ocean freight (in tons) completed the plan at 106%.

The statement said that in the first half of this year, the total volume of construction and installation was completed at 99% of the plan, an increase of 11% over the same period last year. The construction plans for the Ferizaj Thermal Power Station, the Ferizaj Refinery, the Vodej Hydroelectric Power Station, the Mao Zedong Textile Factory, and others have been completed or exceeded.

The statement said that agricultural workers, in these six months, with a comprehensive and tremendous effort, have taken special measures to overcome the difficulties caused by adverse weather conditions and have achieved satisfactory results. Agricultural workers have widely promoted advanced experience and the results of scientific experiments, and have made and are continuing to make great efforts to ensure that the bold guarantee of an average yield of 30 hundredweight per hectare on one-third of the wheat sowing area nationwide and an average yield of 40 hundredweight per hectare on one-fourth of the corn sowing area nationwide is realized.

The statement said that in the first half of this year, 62% of the annual land reclamation plan has been completed, and some areas have already completed the annual land reclamation plan. The sowing area from last autumn to this spring has increased by more than 35,000 hectares compared to the previous year. By July 20 this year, 90% of the wheat planting area has been harvested. Currently, great efforts are being made to sow late corn, and by July 20, approximately 19,000 hectares more than the original plan have been sown, about 21,000 hectares more than last year.

The statement said that in the first half of this year, while completing the 1968 plan tasks, a series of technical and organizational measures have been taken to implement the task of rural electrification by November 8, 1971, as determined by the Fourth Plenum of the Party Central Committee.

The statement said that compared to the same period last year, the turnover of commodities in the first half of this year has increased by 8%, and the supply of edible oils, sugar, milk, and cotton cloth to the people has increased to varying degrees.

The statement concluded by saying that the achievements made in completing the national plan for the first half of this year show that the Albanian working people are better mastering and implementing the Party's teachings on further revolutionizing the thoughts, work, and lives of the working people. These achievements and the further deep implementation of the Party's revolutionary resolutions and Comrade Enver Hoxha's teachings are a powerful reliance and great encouragement for completing and exceeding the historical tasks of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and the 1968 plan.

    公报说，在劳动党第五次代表大会的伟大思想的指引下，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级、合作社农民和全体劳动人民，为实现党的三中全会和四中全会制定的一九六八年任务，以不断增长的革命干劲和革命热情进行了劳动。霍查同志一九六七年十二月在佩什科比的讲话和今年四月关于“工人阶级监督”的讲话，把劳动积极性提升到了一个更高的阶段。

    公报说，农业劳动者在这六个月中以全面的巨大努力，采取了特别的措施，克服了由于不良气候条件造成的困难，取得了令人满意的结果。农业劳动者广泛地推广先进经验和科学实验的成果，为实现在全国三分之一的小麦播种面积上每公顷平均产三十公担和在全国四分之一的玉米播种面积上每公顷平均产四十公担的大胆的保证，已作出并正在继续作出巨大努力。
    公报说，今年上半年完成了全年开荒计划的百分之六十二，一些区已经完成了全年开荒计划。去秋到今春的播种面积比上一年度增长了三万五千多公顷。截止今年七月二十日，百分之九十的小麦种植面积已经收割完毕。目前正在为播种晚玉米进行巨大工作，截止七月二十日，已比原计划多播种了一万九千公顷左右，约比去年多二万一千公顷。
    公报说，今年上半年，在完成一九六八年计划任务同时，还采取一系列技术和组织措施，以贯彻执行党中央四中全会确定的关于在一九七一年十一月八日前实现农村电气化的任务。
    公报说，和去年同期相比，今年上半年的商品周转增长了百分之八，供应人民的食用油料、糖、牛奶和棉布等都有不同程度的增长。
    公报最后说，在完成今年上半年国家计划时所取得的成果表明，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民正在更好地掌握和贯彻党关于使劳动人民的思想、工作和生活进一步革命化的教导。这些成果和进一步深入贯彻党的革命化决议和霍查同志的教导，是完成和超额完成劳动党第五次代表大会的历史性任务和一九六八年计划的有力依靠和巨大鼓舞。
